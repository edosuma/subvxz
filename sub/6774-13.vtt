00:00.134 --> 00:02.334
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.269
 We've been investigating
 the murder of rebecca hinton.

00:04.271 --> 00:08.140
   She had evidence
   that max rager was causing
   temporary psychosis.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.775
    We know about the memo.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.243
   Your product kills people.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.812
       Liv, what are you?

00:14.315 --> 00:15.381
           (gasping)

00:16.851 --> 00:18.083
            Cameron?

00:19.954 --> 00:22.921
    This is the guy who took
    our astronaut brains.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.490
  The guy who knows too much.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.725
    Your emergency contact.
    Olivia moore.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.793
     Yeah, she's my sister.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.395
       How soon would you
       be able to start?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.511
    Just calm your ass down.

00:45.513 --> 00:49.048
  We're not a pizza place.
  There's no 30-minute-or-less
  guarantee.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.116
   You'll get your astronaut
   brains when you get them.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.318
       Checked his house.
       I checked his car.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.686
     No sign of the brains.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.056
 Who is this guy, and why is he
 all up in our business?

00:57.058 --> 00:58.190
    Works at helton shelter,

00:58.192 --> 01:00.726
     That home for runaways
     near nine trolls.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.894
      Or at least he did.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.163
  That's a termination letter.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.698
     I guess that kid
     i got my shoes off of
     must've lived there.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.934
       -Maybe he just
       dumped the brains.
       -No.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.202
  He wouldn't have done that.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.538
  He needs them.
  They're his proof we exist.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.906
         "see. Brains."

01:14.575 --> 01:16.408
            (sighs)

01:16.410 --> 01:18.777
 Let's go see if he's ready
 to tell us where he's stashed
 our product, huh?

01:22.316 --> 01:24.049
          Hey, buddy.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.951
   You remember what you did
   with our brains?

01:26.420 --> 01:30.689
          Kiss my ass.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.291
       I love the moxie.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.026
 But i'm the mick jagger here.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.327
      Time is on my side.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.839
      (theme song playing)

02:08.996 --> 02:10.562
     She slipped
     her police protection.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.999
  -Then?
  -At 10:42 p.M.
  911 dispatch received a call

02:14.001 --> 02:16.735
   From room 233
   at the piney trail lodge.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.970
         It was teresa.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.371
    She didn't get any words
    out of her mouth,

02:19.373 --> 02:20.939
    But she was found
    clutching the receiver.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.342
      Bludgeoned to death.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.944
    She was meeting this guy

02:25.946 --> 02:27.613
        Cameron, there.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.415
    There was a text
    from cameron asking her
    to show up and bring

02:30.417 --> 02:34.153
    "the stuff" belonging to
    this guy sebastian.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.056
   Also deceased.
   Known murderer,
   suspected max rager fixer.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.359
     Cameron said he wanted
     to use this stuff

02:40.361 --> 02:41.760
    To track sebastian down.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.228
        Seems foolhardy.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.331
  We do know sebastian killed
  our cheerleader kimber.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
    And we assume he killed
    nate and kimber

02:48.669 --> 02:51.136
  As revenge for running him
  over and burying him alive.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.571
       It would certainly
       motivate me.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.873
 But it's looking like someone
 else could've killed nate,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.542
      Then killed teresa.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.111
 I'm afraid cameron
 might already be face-to-face
 with his maker.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.713
 We found his blood in the bed.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.882
     Well, let's hope he's
     on the run and not
     dead already.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.318
      I'll put out an apb.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.619
      Let me know
      if you get anything.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.089
       I hope you brought
       your appetite.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.393
   I've met this girl before.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.894
 Not to speak ill of the dead,

03:15.896 --> 03:17.863
   But she's kind
   of a snarky little bitch.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.598
    I doubt i'll even notice
    the difference.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.833
      Piss off, nancy boy.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.936
     The prosecution rests.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.277
      This indian mustard
      you brought in

03:32.279 --> 03:34.046
      Sucks donkey parts.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.647
      A delight as always,
      olivia moore.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.017
        Liv! Come here.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.121
             Ta-da!

03:44.091 --> 03:45.891
     One former zombie rat.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.492
          Good as new.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.262
   Just think, a few months
   of observation and testing

03:50.264 --> 03:51.496
     And if all goes well,

03:51.498 --> 03:53.031
      -This could be you.
      -Months?

03:53.033 --> 03:54.499
         Screw that.
         I'm ready now.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.269
   Need i remind you that our
   first zombie rat expired

03:57.271 --> 03:58.971
    48 hours after receiving
    the cure?

03:58.973 --> 04:00.105
         I don't care.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.441
 The man that i wanted to marry

04:02.443 --> 04:04.409
       Has vowed to kill
       every last zombie.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.012
 And last night my best friend
 looked at me like
 i was a monster,

04:07.014 --> 04:08.280
   Which, incidentally, i am.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.682
   I want my life back, ravi.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.317
         I eat brains.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.720
        It's disgusting.
        I am disgusting.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.589
      I'll sign a waiver.
      Just let me do it.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.968
      This is all we have.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.437
   One dose. Two,
   perhaps, if we stretch it.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.041
    We're completely out
    of the tainted utopium.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.377
     Right now,
     i can't replicate it.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.412
     But if our little mate
     here survives,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.314
  That'll be the next mission.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.082
        Turning you back
        to your old self

04:44.084 --> 04:45.751
   Is the primary objective,

04:46.387 --> 04:48.320
        But it is vital

04:48.322 --> 04:51.123
 That we're able to do the same
 with all the other zombies
 we believe are out there.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.729
           I suppose.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.968
  Rub it in, you smug little...

05:05.472 --> 05:06.772
        Boy: Move, rat!

05:13.547 --> 05:15.447
       I'm such a moron.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.015
      I know who's killing
      these kids.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.053
       Max rager?
       How do you figure?

05:21.055 --> 05:23.622
 In my vision, teresa was
 retrieving sebastian's wallet.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.856
    The last time i saw it,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.291
     Sebastian was putting
     the thumb drive

05:26.293 --> 05:29.561
 With the incriminating max
 rager inter-office memo in it.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.664
   The one that said
   their product was causing
   psychotic episodes,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.534
   That their most heavy-duty
   consumers were raging out,
         killing people.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.202
    So you think that's what
    this is all about?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.638
 Getting that thumb drive back?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.939
          It adds up.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.041
     Max rager texted nate
     from kimber's phone.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.643
 They weren't asking for money,

05:44.645 --> 05:45.877
   They were offering money.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.446
    Maybe the kids took it,
    maybe they didn't.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.081
     But it looks like
     max rager isn't taking

05:49.083 --> 05:51.083
  Any chances with witnesses.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.317
       We should probably
       go talk to them.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.152
           You think?

05:55.956 --> 05:58.357
      <i> I came in on my own.</i>
      <i> I didn't have to.</i>

05:58.359 --> 05:59.591
    <i> -And now this?</i>
    <i> -You've stated you have</i>

05:59.593 --> 06:00.892
 <i> An appetite for human brains.</i>

06:00.894 --> 06:04.162
  -What happened to his face?
  -A boat ran over him.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.532
    -And he survived?
    -Well, you know,
    in a manner of speaking.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.000
   Now, the fellow conducting
   the interview,

06:09.002 --> 06:10.902
      He's our former head
      of research,

06:10.904 --> 06:12.404
      He's the man
      you'll be replacing.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.940
    Yes, i read all of
    dr. Yeltsin's research,
    everything you sent me.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.943
     It's ground-breaking.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.544
     I can't imagine
     why he's giving it up.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.513
      Well, it wasn't
      exactly his choice.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.583
           (grunting)

06:28.555 --> 06:30.422
  As you can see, we're still
  working out the bugs.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.024
     But hey, it's science.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.226
 You're gonna break a few eggs.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.302
           A zombie?

06:44.304 --> 06:46.938
  I'm sorry. You're saying
  this sebastian is a zombie?

06:46.940 --> 06:49.241
    Well, now you're getting
    into semantics here.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.410
     He craves brains,
     he can't seem to die,

06:51.412 --> 06:53.545
      His heart beats once
      every six seconds.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.147
    Yeah, i guess, you know,
    after awhile,

06:55.149 --> 06:56.915
   If it walks like a duck
   and quacks like a duck...

06:56.917 --> 06:57.983
    But how did he become...

06:57.985 --> 07:00.085
    Well, he claims that he

07:00.087 --> 07:02.187
  Accidentally sampled
  the blood of a young woman.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.655
       It's a long story.
       It's a long story.

07:03.657 --> 07:07.125
    Anyway, this young woman
    later revealed herself
    to be a zombie.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.094
    Next thing he knows,
    he's back from the dead,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.663
     He's white as a sheet,
     tooling for brains.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.198
       Hillary: <i> Vaughn,</i>
      <i> the police are here.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:16.368
    Just a minute, hillary.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.637
   You know,
   i'd love to get a look at
   one of these zombies.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.172
       I knew you would!

07:20.174 --> 07:21.773
     And that's why
     i called you in early.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.076
   The girl, the zombie that
   turned sebastian into one?

07:25.078 --> 07:26.745
 She's right outside that door.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.847
     She's with seattle pd.
     Guess what she does?

07:30.818 --> 07:33.218
       Medical examiner.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.753
 (chuckling)
 who writes this stuff, right?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.988
 Hillary, send them in, please.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.959
 Okay, hold on.
 Let me get something straight.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.528
   Three teenagers are dead,

07:43.530 --> 07:46.198
   And you're suggesting that
   i'm somehow responsible?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.934
   We simply asked if you or
   anyone else at max rager

07:48.936 --> 07:50.368
   Reached out to nate boden

07:50.370 --> 07:53.839
    Offering a reward for
    the return of max rager
    company secrets.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.208
       But if the subtext
       is confusing,

07:56.210 --> 07:59.177
 Yeah, we're suggesting you had
 something to do with it.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.481
   Well, i've been in milan
   since our first memorable
         tete-a-tete.

08:02.483 --> 08:06.418
   Oh, you didn't
   make it back for your
   assistant's funeral, then?

08:06.420 --> 08:10.489
    An assistant bent
    on leaking trade secrets
    to the press? No.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.891
   Sebastian myers,
   the murderer in that case,

08:12.893 --> 08:15.360
 Worked for you.
 Personal security, i believe.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.429
      Hey!
      Creepy-stares-a-lot.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.331
     I'm not on a sex-cam.
     I can see you.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.335
            Now, we let
            sebastian go,
            oh, years ago.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.505
 Some drunk snowboarder
 crashed into me in sun valley

08:26.507 --> 08:28.406
      And sebastian nearly
      beat him to death.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.876
  Loyal to a fault, that kid.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.578
   I would never root
   for anybody's death, okay?

08:33.580 --> 08:36.681
  But i must admit i did feel
  a modicum of relief

08:36.683 --> 08:39.150
 When i found out that you had
 run him over in a boat.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.820
    It probably saved lives.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.054
       He survived that.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.524
         Is that right?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.859
     And then he was
     run over by those four
     joyriding teenagers,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.494
    And survived that, too.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.763
  A witness claimed he killed
  the first of those teens

08:51.765 --> 08:53.398
      With his bare hands.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.134
 Last night at 10:32, the third
 of those dead teenagers

08:56.136 --> 08:58.270
      Was beaten to death
      in a motel room.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.872
    Well, i don't mean to do
    your job for you,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.608
 But it sounds like you should
 be out looking for sebastian.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.943
    Oh, we know where he is.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.579
        He's in a drawer
        at the morgue.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.148
  He was dead
  half an hour before
  the girl in the motel room.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.185
              Oh.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.121
     But if you don't mind
     my asking,

09:16.757 --> 09:17.856
        How did he die?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.293
    He was stabbed to death.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.662
              -By?
              -Me.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.998
              Ah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.367
    Accomplishing what a car
    and a boat couldn't.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.102
     I'd stay on
     this one's good side.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.371
           Excuse me.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.707
  Can we back up to what you
  were saying about sebastian

09:35.709 --> 09:37.943
    Being loyal to a fault?

09:37.945 --> 09:39.311
       Clive: Babineaux.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.446
         How long ago?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.015
      We'll check it out.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.551
     Someone just paid for
     a tank of gas with
     cameron's credit card.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.720
        -We gotta move.
        -Okay, then.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.956
   Thanks for coming by,
   really enjoyed this chat.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.191
    Don't be strangers.
    Reception will validate.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.430
     This has got to suck.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.304
   (sighs) so i've been doing
   a bit of online research,

10:06.306 --> 10:08.640
 Trying to figure out how long
 you'll survive in here

10:08.642 --> 10:11.009
    Before body parts start
    falling off,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.477
  And guess what i discovered?

10:12.479 --> 10:15.146
  Most of the pertinent data
  comes courtesy of the nazis.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.382
             Yeah.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.917
          Those nazis.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.118
       Great minds, huh?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.386
      They wanted to know

10:21.388 --> 10:22.721
     If there was something
     in russian genetics

10:22.723 --> 10:24.656
   That allowed those
   commie bastards to survive

10:24.658 --> 10:26.591
      Stalingrad winters.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.360
  Spoiler alert, there wasn't.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.829
 Turns out we all freeze
 to death roughly the same way.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.531
         But i digress.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.635
    The point is, they kept
    meticulous notes.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.437
  And thanks to those notes,
  i can keep you in here alive

10:39.439 --> 10:41.473
       And suffering
       as long as i want.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.542
   As long as it takes to get
   the information i need.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.810
    Why are you doing this?

10:46.446 --> 10:47.545
         Daddy issues.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.381
          Megalomania.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.116
             Greed.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.951
              Wow.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.753
     That felt really good
     to get off my chest.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.023
  Before his untimely demise,

10:58.025 --> 11:02.160
  Dr. Yeltsin raved about you
  and your research,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.395
      Called you a genius.

11:03.397 --> 11:06.064
    If only the fda thought
    as highly of it.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.867
   Yeah, well, they just
   don't get the big picture,
   do they?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.569
    -And you're out
    of pharmaceuticals now.
    -Mmm-hmm.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.371
   We are a beverage company.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.539
         Less red tape.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.075
     But grander ambitions.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.011
        With super max,

11:20.013 --> 11:23.148
 Our consumers
 will no longer have to sleep.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.350
      Exhaustion will be
      a thing of the past.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.621
       Super max will be
       an amphetamine,

11:29.623 --> 11:31.790
     A steroid, an opioid.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.558
    It will be to serotonin

11:33.560 --> 11:35.593
      What milton hershey
      was to chocolate.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.962
 Dr. Yeltsin brought us close.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.098
       You will take us
       all the way home.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.504
  In rare cases, users may
  develop a taste for brains.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.506
   That strikes me
   as the sort of side effect

11:48.508 --> 11:50.241
    That could put
    a serious dent in sales.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.644
   Which is why you're going
   to isolate and remove

11:52.646 --> 11:56.848
 Whatever it is in the formula
 that contributes to
 the zombie problem.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.451
    And as for those zombies
    who are still

11:59.453 --> 12:03.455
     Wandering about, well,
     just leave them to me.

12:03.457 --> 12:06.024
      By the time you've
      completed your task,

12:06.026 --> 12:08.593
   There won't be any left
   to affect our bottom-line.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.166
       So, what time was
       the card swiped?

12:15.168 --> 12:16.668
           7:01 a.M.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.770
          Clerk: 7:01.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.940
           Oh, yeah.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.274
      I remember that guy.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.476
          Serious bo.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.881
        Two soft drinks.
        Two hot dogs.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.083
  He looks nervous,
  but he doesn't look bloody.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.521
      (mouthing) help me.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.023
        They've got him.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.225
 And he's running out of time.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.771
  Maybe we'll get another hit
  off cameron's credit card.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.673
   At least we can establish
   the general direction
   they're taking him.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.175
     Hey, gas station dude?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.244
  Maybe next time try noticing
  something more

12:59.246 --> 13:01.713
 About a possible kidnap victim
 than his wicked funk?

13:01.715 --> 13:04.716
   Like, oh, i don't know,
   maybe the kind of vehicle
   he got out of.

13:04.718 --> 13:05.950
      There you both are.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.453
        Nice ball sack.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.954
       She can't help it.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.422
  Evidently. What do you got?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.626
      -The murder weapons.
      -Billiard balls?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.194
    While examining teresa,

13:16.196 --> 13:18.496
     I was reminded of
     a case i worked during
     my apprenticeship.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.698
       That case involved
       snooker balls.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.333
     Snooker,
     being an english game,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.536
    Requires more skill than
    common "pool,"

13:24.538 --> 13:27.071
     As it employs the use
     of 21 object balls

13:27.073 --> 13:28.506
       Of a smaller size.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.642
 Point being, i found these in
 a dumpster behind the motel

13:30.644 --> 13:31.910
   Where teresa was murdered.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.244
   The killer would've placed
   these in a pillowcase

13:33.246 --> 13:35.180
        -And then, wham.
        -Man: Babineaux.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.249
      911 just got a call
      from your guy.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.285
 (snaps fingers)
 tell them to forward it to me.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.554
   Are there any
   pool halls near the motel?

13:42.556 --> 13:44.589
 I can find out. See if
 anyone's missing these three.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.560
      Here's the 911 call.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.295
        Man: <i> Oh man,</i>
       <i> you gotta help me.</i>

13:50.297 --> 13:52.030
     <i> I think they're gonna</i>
     <i> waste my ass.</i>

13:52.032 --> 13:53.665
 Male operator: <i> Can you tell me</i>
<i> where you are, sir?</i>

13:53.667 --> 13:55.266
      Man: <i> I'm in the trunk</i>
     <i> of some car.</i>

13:55.268 --> 13:58.236
     (stammering)
     <i> we were driving but we</i>
     <i> stopped for a while.</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:02.140
     (shouting) <i> no, no, no!</i>

14:03.610 --> 14:05.276
             Clive.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.911
 Dispatch is saying
 they're still getting a signal
 from the phone.

14:06.913 --> 14:07.178
    Where's it coming from?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.017
    Cameron's phone stopped
    putting out a signal.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.886
    Maybe the battery died.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.023
   Yeah, that's probably it.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.696
         Knock, knock.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.733
     -I have to pee.
     -No one's
     stopping you, brother.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.468
       Look, i don't know
       if you're hungry,

14:30.470 --> 14:31.736
    But you know what my mom
    always says?

14:31.738 --> 14:33.571
      "why'd i stop using
      birth control?"

14:33.573 --> 14:36.074
    No. "there's always room
    for soup!"

14:36.443 --> 14:37.508
            Come on.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.478
         There you go.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.349
            (slurps)

14:44.351 --> 14:46.317
 Say what you want about
 the lady that owns this place,

14:46.319 --> 14:49.153
    She makes a mean
    bean and bratwurst stew.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.727
         What the hell?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.695
  Oh, looks like you found the
  secret to our secret recipe.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.197
              Oh!

14:59.199 --> 15:00.431
           (spitting)

15:00.433 --> 15:02.267
           Aw, c'mon.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.502
   Eating brains doesn't make
   you a monster.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.837
 It takes a little more effort.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.541
             Tommy?

15:11.912 --> 15:15.113
   I almost forgot.
   One of your runaway kids,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.347
    Destined to run no more.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.521
           (groaning)

15:28.094 --> 15:29.427
           (barking)

15:36.369 --> 15:37.435
        It's cameron's.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.509
   So, i guess we get
   a giant can opener
   and start checking trunks.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.479
         Or maybe not.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.814
  If you're gonna kill cameron

15:49.816 --> 15:52.083
   And leave him in the trunk
   of a car to be demolished,

15:52.085 --> 15:54.686
    And see he has a phone,
    you don't leave it
    here and on.

15:54.688 --> 15:55.954
   You'd know we'd find him.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.388
     Maybe they didn't know
     he had the phone.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.190
      Then how does it get
      inside the tire?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.894
   There is a traffic camera
   at the last intersection.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.196
  We need to see those photos.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.966
 Liv: What are we looking for?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.567
 We don't know the
 make of the car

16:09.569 --> 16:11.903
   Or who was driving
   while cameron was calling
   from the trunk.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.338
     If my hunch is right,

16:13.340 --> 16:14.806
     We're gonna recognize
     the driver.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.942
 I don't think vaughn du clark
 is doing his own dirty work.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.010
        And there he is.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.817
         Liv: Oh, cam.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.452
    What were you thinking?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.654
    Probably something about
    all that max rager money

16:29.656 --> 16:32.423
   He wouldn't have to split
   with his bandmates.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.126
    I need to modify an apb
    on cameron henley.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.128
     <i> He's last seen driving</i>
     <i> a white impala.</i>

16:40.834 --> 16:44.002
    Hey! Five bucks to wash
    your windshield?

16:44.004 --> 16:46.004
   Ugh. With what, your ass?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.872
       I'm kick-starting
       this bitch, man.

16:47.874 --> 16:51.209
   I take your five dollars
   and i buy a glass cleaner,
   a rag,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.343
      And i'm in business.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.078
              Hey.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.880
      How would you like
      to earn ten dollars?

17:11.631 --> 17:15.733
     (whispering)
     if you're the redhead
     with the green dress,

17:15.734 --> 17:17.801
 That must make me
 the guy with the thumb drive.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.170
         Let me see it.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.605
       After i get a peek
       in the backpack.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.819
 I hope you were more discreet
 with what's on this.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.155
   I didn't make any copies,

17:37.157 --> 17:38.356
 If that's what you're asking.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.791
             Good.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.527
   My employer is someone you
   don't want to screw with.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.162
      Look, in case
      you hadn't noticed,

17:44.931 --> 17:46.097
         Neither am i.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.666
             Okay.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.868
        This is for you.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.471
           Dillinger.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.673
  Finish it before you leave.
  We shouldn't
  walk out together.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.616
  Man: See, i got a bum knee,
  pardon the pun,

18:05.618 --> 18:08.319
  That acts up when it rains.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.987
       If i could afford
       a bus ticket...

18:21.835 --> 18:24.135
    Yeah, we got a possible
    281 on that apb.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.739
         (car explodes)

18:47.627 --> 18:51.195
  Sir, he paid you ten dollars
  to watch his car. Then what?

18:51.197 --> 18:53.731
  Yeah, so, i watched his car,
  like he asked.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.433
     And i turned away for
     like a minute,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.635
    And when i turned back,
    i saw some dudes

18:57.637 --> 18:59.737
        Rolling out from
        under the car.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.672
    And then a moment later,
    the kid comes out.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.909
    He's got a backpack now,
    i remember that.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.577
         And i like...

19:07.480 --> 19:08.746
      And he walked away.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.014
            Then...

19:10.016 --> 19:12.083
      (imitates explosion)

19:12.085 --> 19:15.186
     He made a funny sound
     while spitting on you?

19:15.188 --> 19:18.156
   Do you remember
   anything else,
   like what he was wearing?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.291
 Anything we can add
 to the description of cameron?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.595
  The backpack, it was orange.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.989
       Hey, do you know
       why we've stopped?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.658
    Border's just up ahead.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.493
    Canadian customs
    has to check passports,

19:55.495 --> 19:57.295
      Do cavity searches,
      all that stuff.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.598
       Geez, hon, relax.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.300
      I was kidding about
      the cavity searches.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.146
    Customs inspection, son.
    Need you to return
    to your seat.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.747
     Dude, i'm dying here,

20:16.749 --> 20:19.250
    Some lady's been
    locked in the bathroom
    for the past half-hour,

20:19.252 --> 20:20.484
          I gotta go.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.555
          -All right.
          -Thanks.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.123
            Thanks.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.095
     Hold on a minute, son.

20:32.966 --> 20:36.067
    Can you give me
    a description of the kid
    we're looking for again?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.806
         Cameron: Look,

20:41.808 --> 20:44.141
 I'm telling you
 i didn't kill nate and teresa.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.179
    These were used
    to beat teresa to death.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.881
    Stolen from a pool hall

20:50.883 --> 20:55.386
   Two blocks from
   the hotel where her body
   and your blood was found.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.155
 The manager of that pool hall
 just picked you
 out of our lineup.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.358
  I'm guessing that you picked
  at that scab,

21:00.360 --> 21:03.160
   And left the blood on the
   motel sheets as a mislead.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.330
    Same as the gas station
    and 911 performances.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.498
         All for show.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.004
 Then what do you want from me?

21:13.006 --> 21:15.573
  I want to know what sort
  of person kills his friends
  for three hundred grand.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.278
         I want a deal.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.114
 I want to be tried as a minor.
 Then i'll talk.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.615
      Otherwise,
      i want a lawyer now.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.257
    There must be something
    pretty wicked

21:33.259 --> 21:35.893
  On that thumb drive
  if they wanted it so badly.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.730
  I mean, what's a copy of it
  worth to you?

21:39.732 --> 21:43.134
   There is a police officer
   fighting for his life
   right now,

21:43.136 --> 21:44.702
   So i've got a better idea.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.705
 How about we just let you go,

21:47.707 --> 21:51.108
 Escort you right out the front
 door of the station?

21:51.110 --> 21:53.778
     Our press liaison
     will tell the world
     you were cooperative,

21:53.780 --> 21:56.614
    And we just let whoever
    put that transmitter
    in your book bag,

21:56.616 --> 21:58.749
   The same people who
   put that bomb in your car,

21:59.419 --> 22:01.419
           Find you.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.887
       Do whatever it is
       they do to you.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.289
     I can live with that.

22:11.464 --> 22:15.399
 Nate got a text from
 kimber's phone after she died.

22:17.904 --> 22:21.405
  <i> A phone number and a message</i>
  <i> saying, "need to talk."</i>

22:21.407 --> 22:24.809
    Nate called and a woman
    offered $300,000

22:24.811 --> 22:28.479
  For a thumb drive that was
  in the wallet of that psycho
  freak that killed kimber.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.247
<i> Nate wanted to go to the cops.</i>

22:30.249 --> 22:31.315
       <i> I wanted the cash.</i>

22:31.317 --> 22:33.250
   I mean, we stole the car,

22:33.252 --> 22:36.420
        Ran over a guy,
        buried him alive

22:36.422 --> 22:38.589
      And were all high
      as hell at the time.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.691
      Going to the police
      wasn't gonna happen.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.827
   <i> And i didn't want to kill</i>
   <i> teresa, either.</i>

22:42.829 --> 22:45.429
       <i> But we all have</i>
       <i> "find my friends"</i>
       <i> on our phones,</i>

22:45.431 --> 22:46.997
      <i> And when i couldn't</i>
      <i> locate her,</i>

22:46.999 --> 22:50.067
    <i> Guess where</i>
    <i> the little blinking dot</i>
    <i> showed where she was?</i>

22:51.904 --> 22:53.838
          Right here.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.873
 Ratting us out to the police.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.775
     That girl talked big,

22:59.445 --> 23:01.946
     But a wuss
     when things got real.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.817
   Clive: No wonder max rager
   went after her.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.487
     Rebecca's article here
     uncovers everything.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.722
 They knew about the psychotic
 breaks their product caused,

23:11.724 --> 23:13.991
   They buried it, and people
   died as a result.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.826
  She had the smoking gun memo
  to back it all up.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.864
    What's this video file?

23:19.866 --> 23:22.533
  Man on computer:
  <i> Don't just live to the max,</i>
  <i> live beyond it.</i>

23:23.536 --> 23:24.935
           <i> Super max.</i>

23:25.772 --> 23:27.304
       That's ridiculous.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.708
   It's just caffeine, right?
   It's not like it's magic.

23:30.710 --> 23:34.178
 I should check in downstairs,
 let ravi know
 what we've learned.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.480
       Liv: <i> Clive's right,</i>
      <i> it's ridiculous.</i>

23:37.116 --> 23:38.582
        <i> Unless it's not.</i>

23:38.584 --> 23:41.819
   <i> If max rager put the rage</i>
   <i> into full-on zombie mode,</i>

23:41.821 --> 23:43.788
   <i> What's super max gonna do?</i>

23:43.790 --> 23:46.390
  <i> Seattle observer?</i> I need to
   speak to the news editor.

23:49.362 --> 23:50.594
             Ravi?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.197
             Ravi.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.933
         Must be nice.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.236
       No brains to eat.

23:59.238 --> 24:03.207
     No ghastly memories
     of the dead to process
     or obsess over.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.776
     (cell phone vibrating)

24:08.314 --> 24:09.680
        Hey, what's up?

24:09.682 --> 24:12.116
     Have you seen or heard
     from major?

24:12.118 --> 24:15.352
    Not since he dropped off
    those coolers of brains
    at my place. Why?

24:15.354 --> 24:17.955
    It doesn't look like
    he came home last night.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.924
       I'm really worried
       about him, liv.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.058
           I am too.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.093
     Any word from peyton?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.095
         Uh, sadly, no.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.365
    I'll reach out to major.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.502
      I'm so sick
      of this life, ravi.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.904
         Hang in there.

24:34.774 --> 24:35.573
   It's not much longer now.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.711
      (cell phone chimes)

24:40.713 --> 24:43.914
   Text just came in on our
   brain thief's cell phone.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.049
        You'll like it.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.021
        I'll be damned.

24:51.023 --> 24:54.859
   Liv: <i> "one dose, maybe two,"</i>
  <i> that's what ravi said.</i>

24:54.861 --> 24:56.760
   <i> I'll take half</i>
   <i> and live with the results.</i>

24:57.363 --> 24:59.530
       <i> Or die with them.</i>

24:59.532 --> 25:01.732
   <i> Ravi can reverse-engineer</i>
   <i> with whatever's left.</i>

25:03.236 --> 25:04.735
     (cell phone vibrating)

25:13.446 --> 25:15.613
      I was starting
      to worry about you.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.915
 After all we've been through,
 that warms my heart.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.384
 Why do you have major's phone?

25:20.386 --> 25:22.219
   <i> He took something of mine.</i>

25:22.221 --> 25:23.587
        I'm just trying
        to get it back.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.890
     -Please don't hurt him.
    <i> -I give you my word.</i>

25:25.892 --> 25:28.092
 Bring me those monkey brains,
 and he'll be fine.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.160
   <i> I take it by your silence</i>

25:30.162 --> 25:32.596
  We're not going to play the
  "what brains?" game.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.165
      I appreciate that.
      But let me be clear.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.902
 If i don't get back my brains,

25:37.904 --> 25:40.738
    I'm opening up his skull
    and eating his.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.172
     <i> Judging by the quiver</i>
     <i> in your voice,</i>

25:42.174 --> 25:43.941
   And the fact that he was
   willing to freeze to death

25:43.943 --> 25:45.376
    Rather than give you up,

25:45.378 --> 25:46.810
   I'm guessing that's a meal

25:46.812 --> 25:48.546
       That would bring
       our relationship
       to the next level.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.848
        I'll bring them.
        Tell me where.

26:20.513 --> 26:21.912
      I want to see major.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.681
       You don't want
       to catch up first?

26:23.683 --> 26:24.848
  I have so much to tell you.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.418
        Raincheck, then.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.253
    Bring out the boy scout.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.341
        Blaine: Yessir.

26:50.343 --> 26:51.575
    That is the right stuff.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.045
    Miss moore,
    it's always a pleasure.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.297
         Mmm. So good.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.099
  With runaways,
  you don't need to get fancy,

27:16.302 --> 27:18.402
      The natural flavors
      do all the work.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.004
         (saw buzzing)

27:20.006 --> 27:21.138
       I hate that noise.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.475
        (music playing)

27:40.092 --> 27:41.291
           (rasping)

27:44.830 --> 27:45.896
            (groans)

27:52.405 --> 27:53.537
           (panting)

27:57.743 --> 27:58.909
       (distant laughter)

28:28.808 --> 28:30.607
   I tried pericardial fluid,

28:30.609 --> 28:31.709
         I tried lymph.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.147
 It has this surprisingly high
 smoke point...

28:40.386 --> 28:41.452
           Get down!

28:41.454 --> 28:42.619
          (gun firing)

28:50.062 --> 28:51.428
           (grunting)

29:09.615 --> 29:10.714
          (gun firing)

29:15.421 --> 29:17.354
  Oh, god. No, please, please.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.858
 Blaine, he did this to me,
 i'm just an artisanal butcher.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.126
    I'm just a chef. Please.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.129
     It's okay.
     Just get out of here.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.463
   (breathlessly) thank you.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.866
   Thank you, god bless you.

29:30.903 --> 29:31.969
           (screams)

29:46.018 --> 29:48.051
   Police dispatcher:
  <i> All units, we have a 10-50n,</i>

29:48.053 --> 29:51.021
       <i> Noise complaint,</i>
       <i> 1021 10th avenue.</i>

29:51.023 --> 29:53.490
     <i> Meat cute charcuterie.</i>
     <i> Possible gunshots.</i>

29:54.894 --> 29:57.227
   Dispatch, this is suzuki,
   i'm right there.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.563
  I'll check it out and radio
  if backup's required.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.631
        -(siren wailing)
        -out.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.716
      Walk away from this.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.784
    Look what you did, man.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.022
        (whirring stops)

31:00.926 --> 31:02.292
       Just what we need.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.027
       A noise complaint.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.463
   You've got the slow
   and agonizing death thing
   under control, right?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.198
    Great. I hope it hurts.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.243
         (music stops)

31:19.245 --> 31:20.544
         -(gun firing)
         -(screams) ah!

31:20.546 --> 31:22.512
   Mother jones! That hurts.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.851
 You killed major, didn't you?

31:28.888 --> 31:31.188
       Okay, let's put
       the gun down, huh?

31:31.824 --> 31:33.056
          Let's talk.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.125
  There's a reason
  you didn't aim for my head.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.827
   I'm the only one who knows

31:36.829 --> 31:39.162
      Who all the zombies
      are in seattle

31:39.164 --> 31:42.499
 And where they live,
 so, really you can't kill me.

31:42.501 --> 31:43.867
      You murdered lowell.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.137
       (groaning)
       just listen to me!

31:48.274 --> 31:50.807
   I feed seattle's zombies.

31:50.809 --> 31:54.111
   If i stop doing that job,
   they don't stop eating,

31:54.113 --> 31:56.179
       And the zombie
       apocalypse begins.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.282
        If you kill me,

31:58.284 --> 32:01.852
   Everyone you love becomes
   a zombie or zombie food.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.662
     Major: (weakly) liv...

32:17.303 --> 32:18.468
              No.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.773
 We have to stop the bleeding.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.441
  (whispers)
  just be here with me, okay?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.678
 I told you there were zombies.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.881
     You didn't believe me.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.183
         Blaine: Wait.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.621
        Oh, man.
        He doesn't know?

32:38.057 --> 32:39.957
            (laughs)

32:39.959 --> 32:44.261
 Dude, you are about to go out
 with one large dose of irony.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.498
      Seattle's preeminent
      zombie hunter

32:48.500 --> 32:51.702
  Not realizing the entire
  time that his own beloved...

32:53.339 --> 32:54.871
            I mean,

32:54.873 --> 32:57.607
      The hair, the eyes,
      the complexion,

32:58.410 --> 32:59.509
 You thought those were, what,

32:59.511 --> 33:01.445
       Just questionable
       style choices?

33:01.447 --> 33:02.512
            (laughs)

33:04.383 --> 33:05.749
     Major: (weakly) liv...

33:06.618 --> 33:07.751
              You?

33:08.887 --> 33:09.953
             Major.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.456
            Please.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.825
     -Please, i...
     -Blaine: What a waste.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.662
    All this sound and fury.
    And for what?

33:19.365 --> 33:21.098
            Nothing.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.066
        I've got friends
        in high places.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.269
      Tomorrow's headline,

33:26.271 --> 33:28.572
      "crackpot shoots up
      butcher shop."

33:30.909 --> 33:33.810
 Kill my crew, i'll make more.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.880
       Kill my customers,

33:36.882 --> 33:38.315
        I'll make more.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.384
       You cost me money.
       I'll make...

33:40.986 --> 33:42.085
            (groans)

33:43.222 --> 33:44.654
     Make more now, bitch.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.224
   -What did you do?
   -You're cured, <i> mazel tov.</i>

33:47.226 --> 33:48.892
     Did you... Is this...

33:50.562 --> 33:52.629
            Oh, no.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.298
 Oh, no, you've really screwed
 the pooch now.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.102
  Let me know if you survive.
  You're our guinea pig now.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.875
  If there's a zombie
  apocalypse, assume i didn't.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.047
        (phone dialing)

34:45.050 --> 34:48.018
  It's suzuki. All clear here.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.887
   Just some kids
   shooting off firecrackers.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.467
       You should try
       to get this down.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.003
        It won't satisfy
        your cravings,

35:07.005 --> 35:08.505
    But it'll help you
    get your strength back.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.441
        It gets better,

35:11.443 --> 35:15.078
   But it would be lying
   to say you get used to it.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.780
 But doesn't lying
 come naturally to you by now?

35:22.187 --> 35:23.587
        You're a zombie.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.223
 Well, you've been a zombie
 since that night on the lake.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.126
       Instead of telling
       me the truth,

35:29.128 --> 35:31.094
   You decided it'd be easier
   to break my heart.

35:31.096 --> 35:32.362
      Better, not easier.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.165
    I know what you would've
    done if i told you.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.500
    You have no faith in me.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.002
    I have more faith
    in you than anyone ever.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.105
    You would've told me
    that it doesn't matter,

35:44.042 --> 35:45.108
   That you loved me anyway.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.944
       And you would've
       sentenced yourself

35:47.946 --> 35:50.013
     To a life without sex,
     without children.

35:50.015 --> 35:51.214
       It's who you are.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.284
  I couldn't ask that of you.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.685
  You couldn't ask that of me,

35:55.687 --> 35:58.188
 But you turned me into a
 zombie without my permission.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.023
   Rather than watch you die.

36:00.025 --> 36:03.393
    You know what i want?
    What sounds good to me?

36:04.897 --> 36:05.962
            Brains.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.198
         Human brains.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.501
     So, you, you eat them,
     don't you? Wait.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.570
           You must.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.075
  You eat the brains of people
  who come in the morgue.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.744
    When zombies eat brains,

36:20.746 --> 36:22.646
      We get the memories
      of the deceased,

36:22.648 --> 36:24.548
        And i help solve
        their murders.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.083
     So, that's what helps
     you sleep at night.

36:27.786 --> 36:28.919
              Hmm.

36:28.921 --> 36:30.086
         What about me?

36:31.823 --> 36:33.557
       What's the greater
       good for me?

36:34.059 --> 36:35.125
              Us?

36:36.562 --> 36:37.627
            I hope.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.064
    We can be together now.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.068
   It's not how we imagined,

36:47.306 --> 36:49.406
  But it's what fate dealt us.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.840
       It's not what fate
       dealt me, liv.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.276
            You did.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.512
   The same person who let me

36:55.514 --> 36:57.847
    Check myself
    into a mental hospital,

36:57.849 --> 36:59.216
   Let me think i was crazy.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.786
   But when you had a chance
   to play god

37:02.788 --> 37:05.655
     And decide whether
     i died or became this,

37:06.892 --> 37:09.359
    Did you decide
    based on what you wanted

37:09.361 --> 37:10.961
 Or what you thought i wanted?

37:13.232 --> 37:14.831
       If it's what you
       thought i wanted,

37:16.168 --> 37:17.968
  Then you don't know me
  as well as you think you do.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.224
         -(gun firing)
         -(groans)

38:04.349 --> 38:05.649
         (gas hissing)

38:34.579 --> 38:36.780
           Oh, my...

39:32.871 --> 39:34.137
     Police officer: Yeah.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.239
  It looks like suzuki
  must've surprised these guys

39:36.241 --> 39:38.108
    And gone down swinging.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.477
      He got five of 'em.
      Poor guy.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.118
            Hold on.

40:03.335 --> 40:04.934
     Blackstock. Come here.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.872
     I need you to bring in
     major lilywhite,

40:08.874 --> 40:10.440
      White male, 30-ish.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.377
      That's his address.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.179
 Run a gun residue test on him.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.614
     -But the lieutenant...
     -Just do it.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.422
     (reporters clamoring)

40:26.458 --> 40:29.592
 Is this the end of max rager?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.594
  Trust me,
  we're just getting started.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.736
         (dog barking)

40:58.723 --> 40:59.606
              Liv?

40:59.607 --> 41:00.490
   Whatever happens now,
   i hope you can forgive me.

41:02.294 --> 41:03.693
 I doubt humanity is going to.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.862
     What? What did you do?

41:10.635 --> 41:11.701
      (cell phone ringing)

41:16.575 --> 41:17.974
              Mom?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.109
            Oh, god.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.317
    Surgeon: Your brother
    has lost a lot of blood,

41:27.319 --> 41:29.152
   And he's going to need
   more in order to survive.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.720
        Unfortunately,
        he's o-negative,

41:30.722 --> 41:32.555
     And we don't have any.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.858
  Liv is o-negative. Remember?

41:34.860 --> 41:37.193
   That time you sliced open
   your head on that nail.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.495
   Evan was a match for you.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.163
     Oh, thank god
     you had your phone on.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.633
       Surgeon: We don't
       have much time.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.201
     Can you come with me,
     miss moore?

41:55.714 --> 41:58.815
      Eva: Liv.
      Go with the doctor!

42:00.418 --> 42:01.484
              No.
