14:50.577 --> 14:51.976
                Huh. Long Beach.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.944
       City by the sea.

14:53.946 --> 14:56.579
      You know this guy?

14:56.581 --> 14:58.914
   No, it's been a long time
since I've been in Long Beach,

14:58.916 --> 15:00.448
        but I wouldn't
      have forgotten him.

15:00.450 --> 15:03.050
      Is this going to be
   a problem for you, Vince,

15:03.052 --> 15:04.351
us driving
out there?

15:04.353 --> 15:07.020
              No.

15:07.022 --> 15:09.756
       When I was a kid,

15:09.758 --> 15:11.224
      everything out here
        was brand-new.

15:11.226 --> 15:12.925
Everybody had just bought
their first car,

15:12.927 --> 15:13.926
their first house...

15:13.928 --> 15:15.227
               Their first wife.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.828
Now look at it.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.362
looks like the Serbian
Army came through.

15:18.364 --> 15:20.897
              Must've been
              a real nice place.

15:20.899 --> 15:22.498
It was.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.100
                I'm here to see
                Lieutenant Katt.

15:25.102 --> 15:26.734
       Vincent LaMarca.

15:26.736 --> 15:29.002
Sam, how are you?

15:29.004 --> 15:31.337
This is my partner in
Battery Division, Reg Duffy.

15:31.339 --> 15:32.538
                       Sam Katt.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.907
     Sit down. Putting on
        a little weight

15:34.909 --> 15:36.642
sitting behind that desk
all day.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.177
             So, what brings you
             back to Long Beach?

15:39.179 --> 15:41.946
We got a floater,
name of Robert Monroe,

15:41.948 --> 15:43.847
about 25,
probably a street dealer.

15:43.849 --> 15:45.481
414 Seacrest Drive.

15:45.483 --> 15:46.782
You got anything
on him?

15:46.784 --> 15:48.750
             No, but we can do
             a run on him. Jean?

15:48.752 --> 15:50.918
Spelled M-O-N-R-O-E?

15:50.920 --> 15:53.186
Lieutenant Katt?

15:53.188 --> 15:55.221
       This is Dave Simon.
       He sits at your old desk.

15:55.223 --> 15:57.122
                 Hey, Reg Duffy.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.023
         So, I thought
   you'd be retired by now.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.524
       You got the time.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.392
I don't know what else
to do except be a cop.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.394
            It's a bullshit job.

16:04.396 --> 16:05.762
He doesn't believe that.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.930
It <i> is</i> bullshit.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.564
Sure, there are
better-paid gigs around,

16:09.566 --> 16:11.232
but personally, I wouldn't
give up my job.

16:11.234 --> 16:12.566
                       Bullshit.

16:12.568 --> 16:14.935
It's their favorite word
in Manhattan: bullshit.

16:14.937 --> 16:17.037
        He didn't talk like that
        when he was here.

16:17.039 --> 16:18.038
This was paradise.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.773
I thought maybe I could
fool myself.

16:19.775 --> 16:21.908
Why'd you leave, Lieutenant?

16:21.910 --> 16:24.377
Okay, he's got
a lot of trespasses,

16:24.379 --> 16:26.011
some burglaries
and assaults.

16:26.013 --> 16:28.113
Last year, he did
six months on Rikers Island

16:28.115 --> 16:29.647
for misdemeanor
possession.

16:29.649 --> 16:32.383
Street dealer.
His alias is "Picasso."

16:32.385 --> 16:34.118
Well, Sam, thanks.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.786
     It's good to see you.

16:35.788 --> 16:37.187
     It was good out here
         for a while.

16:37.189 --> 16:39.189
                    It was nice
                    to meet you.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.890
Good to meet you.

16:40.892 --> 16:42.091
              Hey, Vince.
              Come back anytime.

16:42.093 --> 16:43.459
              Dave will get you
              whatever you want.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.729
         That didn't go too bad.

16:47.731 --> 16:49.263
                 He seemed okay.

16:49.265 --> 16:51.632
      Katt's always been
     one of the good guys.

16:51.634 --> 16:53.900
          Never fuck
    with a family of cops.

16:53.902 --> 16:55.668
      They don't forget.

16:55.670 --> 16:57.870
                  Hey, come over
                  this Sunday.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.138
          Marge thinks you don't
          like her no more.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.106
    You know I love Marge.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.441
            It's the kids, then?
            The little bastards.

17:04.443 --> 17:06.041
      The kids are great.

17:06.044 --> 17:10.179
   Respectful, well-behaved,
         not like you.

17:10.181 --> 17:12.881
   No, I mean, you got a lot
    of love in your house,

17:12.883 --> 17:14.115
     and when I go there,

17:14.117 --> 17:16.282
 I always feel uncomfortable,
           you know.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.851
But thanks for the invitation.

17:17.853 --> 17:19.586
                  Suit yourself.

17:19.588 --> 17:22.055
                 You'll miss it
                 when it's gone.

       Hey, sweetheart,
   give me a cup of coffee.

18:23.114 --> 18:24.480
                Coming right up.

18:24.482 --> 18:26.048
          Hey, Snake.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.349
Spyder.

18:27.351 --> 18:28.850
        Want to lend me
       some money, man?

18:28.852 --> 18:30.718
What?
I got no money.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.686
What gives you the idea
I got money?

18:32.688 --> 18:33.953
      Hey, did you hear?

18:33.955 --> 18:36.322
        Some wacko fuck
  wasted Picasso last night.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.657
Cut him up real bad.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.292
They found his body in the city,
         by the river.

18:41.294 --> 18:45.296
       That's bad, man.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.932
  So I hear that you and Joey
   went shopping last night.

18:50.635 --> 18:52.468
         I hear that Joey Nova's
         Chevy Nova

18:52.470 --> 18:55.070
           got parked
           over in Crystal Park.

18:55.072 --> 18:58.306
        At least, it
        sounds like Joey Nova's.

18:58.308 --> 19:01.609
          Next thing you know,
          my associate, Picasso,

19:01.611 --> 19:04.845
        seems he ain't breathing
        too good anymore.

19:04.847 --> 19:06.880
      You wouldn't know anything
      about that, would you?

19:06.882 --> 19:08.448
  No.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.485
                See, the truth
                of the matter is

19:13.487 --> 19:15.353
                I can't let this
                pass, man.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.288
           I can't let some fuck
           waste my man

19:17.290 --> 19:18.489
               and walk off with
               my bread.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.491
           I'm a laughing stock.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.859
        Who the hell
        is going to work for me,

19:21.861 --> 19:25.028
           I can't protect
           my own people, right?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.598
             It's about respect.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.999
          The way you're acting,

19:29.001 --> 19:34.737
           I feel like I already
           lost your respect.

19:34.739 --> 19:35.971
           So where's Joey Nova?

19:35.973 --> 19:38.239
      I don't know, man.

19:42.611 --> 19:44.043
              Where's Joey Nova?

19:44.045 --> 19:47.279
    He's in the back, man,
        in the toilet.

20:20.311 --> 20:22.277
                    You hear me?

20:22.279 --> 20:25.346
         You're dead!

20:32.254 --> 20:34.220
            How you doing, Herb?

20:34.222 --> 20:35.688
Can't eat, can't sleep.

20:35.690 --> 20:39.358
A good shit is
the adventure of my day.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.960
          I got a little present
          for you.

20:41.962 --> 20:43.695
  When are you going to marry
       that girl in 3A?

20:43.697 --> 20:45.563
       Who said I wanted
        to get married?

20:45.565 --> 20:47.698
Then I'll marry her.
You'll be my best man.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.000
    Sure, only if you have
       a nudist wedding.

20:50.002 --> 20:52.035
          Good night.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.196
           Good night, you guys.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.964
           See you.

21:22.966 --> 21:24.065
Hi, Terri.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.699
    Hey, happy anniversary,
            Vince.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.200
                    Oh, Shut up.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.267
             Bye.

21:28.269 --> 21:29.768
       What's she mean,
         anniversary?

21:29.770 --> 21:31.102
              You've escorted me
              home from work

21:31.104 --> 21:32.736
              every night
              for almost a year.

21:32.738 --> 21:33.937
            I have?

21:33.939 --> 21:35.939
                Well, you missed
                a couple nights

21:35.941 --> 21:37.507
                 here and there.

21:37.509 --> 21:38.941
       I have a tendency

21:38.943 --> 21:40.342
       of turning things
         into a habit.

21:40.344 --> 21:41.643
                Oh, I'm a habit,
                huh?

21:41.645 --> 21:44.012
   Yeah, you're all over me
          like a nun.

21:45.448 --> 21:47.247
What is the first
anniversary, anyway?

21:47.249 --> 21:48.514
Is it paper?

21:48.516 --> 21:49.982
               I don't know,
               something cheesy.

21:49.984 --> 21:52.050
Cheesecake?
Is that what it is?

21:52.052 --> 21:53.251
               Yeah, cheesecake.

21:53.253 --> 21:54.418
Let's go have
some cheesecake.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.186
That's a good idea.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.327
             What?

22:05.329 --> 22:06.695
            I was just thinking.

22:06.697 --> 22:09.497
          About what?

22:09.499 --> 22:12.499
        About what happens next.

22:14.536 --> 22:19.104
        Well, we spoon
    until you fall asleep,

22:19.106 --> 22:23.240
      then I go upstairs,
      catch a few winks,

22:23.242 --> 22:27.210
    I get up at the crack,
   go to work, come home...

22:27.212 --> 22:29.745
                  Have a beer,
                  make dinner...

22:29.747 --> 22:32.247
   ...make dinner, watch TV,

22:32.249 --> 22:35.116
 then head over to the theater
      and walk you home.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.417
                           Good.

22:36.419 --> 22:37.918
       If I'm a good boy
         we make love.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.620
           If you're a good boy?

22:40.622 --> 22:41.954
             Yeah.

22:41.956 --> 22:44.156
      And then you ask me
      what happens next.

22:44.158 --> 22:49.094
               That's very good,
               very smooth.

23:18.558 --> 23:20.758
      In your own words,
       taking your time,

23:20.760 --> 23:22.259
     give us a clear idea

23:22.261 --> 23:27.397
   what happened between you
and this guy on that night, hmm?

23:27.399 --> 23:30.433
  So Joey Nova owes me money,

23:30.435 --> 23:32.501
 and he's going to connect me
    with this guy, Picasso.

23:32.503 --> 23:35.504
  He's going to talk Picasso
   into giving him some dope

23:35.506 --> 23:37.606
so he can step on it and sell.

23:37.608 --> 23:39.140
          So we drive
    through this hurricane

23:39.142 --> 23:40.141
       looking for him,

23:40.143 --> 23:43.377
        and we find him
    down by this refinery.

23:43.379 --> 23:45.846
      Joey goes up to him
      and says something.

23:45.848 --> 23:48.048
  Picasso pulls out a knife,

23:48.050 --> 23:50.350
and Joey goes off on the fucker,
       I mean, way off.

23:50.352 --> 23:52.618
          I'm, like,
   "what the fuck is this?"

23:52.620 --> 23:53.852
              Joey Nova, is that
              his real name?

23:53.854 --> 23:55.486
 That's what people call him.

23:55.488 --> 23:57.488
    He drives a Chevy Nova.

23:57.490 --> 23:59.122
What are you doing here, Snake?

            So go.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.215
Just tell him

35:19.217 --> 35:21.951
        he's better off
   turning himself in to me.

35:33.430 --> 35:34.896
     Hey, where you been?

35:34.898 --> 35:36.864
    I thought you got shot
         or something.

35:36.866 --> 35:40.567
I'm sorry. I should've called.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.267
      Are you all right?

35:44.904 --> 35:45.936
          Rough day.

35:45.938 --> 35:47.837
      Is something wrong?

35:47.839 --> 35:50.272
        No, just tired.

35:55.211 --> 35:56.643
   I just don't feel like--

35:56.645 --> 35:59.078
               I just don't feel
               like talking.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.180
          Okay. Okay.

36:44.624 --> 36:45.656
            Chief.

36:45.658 --> 36:47.057
        Close the door.

36:47.059 --> 36:49.626
           Assistant Police
           Commissioner Johnson,

36:49.628 --> 36:51.928
             and Vanessa Hansen,
             mayor's office.

36:51.930 --> 36:54.063
           Actually,
    Deputy Assistant Mayor.

36:54.065 --> 36:56.999
             Take a seat, Vince.

36:57.001 --> 36:58.166
                  We just wanted
                  to meet you,

36:58.168 --> 36:59.534
            see how to spin this
            for the media.

36:59.536 --> 37:00.801
          Spin what?

37:00.803 --> 37:02.936
 They know about your old man,
            Vince.

37:02.938 --> 37:05.705
         We need to have a story
         to explain

37:05.707 --> 37:07.873
  how the son of an executed
        child-murderer

37:07.875 --> 37:09.641
    was hired and promoted

37:09.643 --> 37:10.642
to homicide detective.

37:10.644 --> 37:11.643
       One of the best.

37:11.645 --> 37:12.944
                One of the best.

37:12.946 --> 37:14.578
     Of New York's finest.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.745
My father
didn't kill the kid.

37:15.747 --> 37:17.379
It was a stupid accident.
Everybody knows that.

37:17.381 --> 37:18.613
It's ancient history.

37:18.615 --> 37:21.215
         Yes, but the 11:00 news
         will be all over this,

37:21.217 --> 37:22.216
        and we want to be ready.

37:22.218 --> 37:23.617
            The first thing
            they'll want to know

37:23.619 --> 37:25.552
            is how you got
            into the department.

37:25.554 --> 37:27.153
        Wait a minute.
    I didn't kill the kid.

37:27.155 --> 37:28.888
      But you were hired
 by a Police Captain McAuley,

37:28.890 --> 37:31.390
      your father-in-law,

37:31.392 --> 37:34.659
              who shepherded you
              into Homicide?

37:34.661 --> 37:36.193
      What are you saying
          about him?

37:36.195 --> 37:38.361
     This is the very guy
   that arrested my father,

37:38.363 --> 37:39.929
   and he took a big chance
           with me.

37:39.931 --> 37:41.597
        Oh, I know.
        I'm not asking anything.

37:41.599 --> 37:43.298
                 I'm just saying

37:43.300 --> 37:44.799
            that this is how the
            media will frame it.

37:44.801 --> 37:46.867
After they executed my old man,
   I was a kid with nothing.

37:46.869 --> 37:49.369
 The only thing that saved me
         was that cop.

37:49.371 --> 37:52.171
He was the kindest guy
I ever met.

37:52.173 --> 37:54.106
Why don't you make that
part of your story?

37:54.108 --> 37:57.976
How's this? "Detective LaMarca
   is in no way responsible.

37:57.978 --> 37:59.477
       "He's had a long
     and honorable career,

37:59.479 --> 38:01.479
    living down the tragedy
of his father's violent past."

38:01.481 --> 38:03.781
My father
wasn't violent.

38:03.783 --> 38:06.083
What is this?

38:06.085 --> 38:07.084
            Would you excuse us?

38:07.086 --> 38:09.019
...criminal behavior,
blah, blah, blah,

38:09.021 --> 38:10.854
something
kind of like that?

38:16.894 --> 38:18.127
                 You see what
                 I'm up against?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.361
              I have to take you
              off the case.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.662
          I should
          reassign you too, Reg.

38:20.664 --> 38:21.929
         Let him stay.
       I want him on it.

38:21.931 --> 38:23.330
                 It's your call.

38:23.332 --> 38:24.931
I don't know.

38:24.933 --> 38:28.400
 I want Joey brought in safe,
  and I know you'll do that.

38:28.402 --> 38:30.135
Okay. All right.

38:30.137 --> 38:31.402
            Rossi!

38:31.404 --> 38:33.537
               You're working
               with Reg on this.

38:33.539 --> 38:35.739
               You take the rest
               of the week off.

38:35.741 --> 38:36.773
 I don't need a week off, sir.

38:36.775 --> 38:39.308
         This isn't a democracy,
         Vince.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.143
I'll give you
a lift home.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.916
    Put my ex-wife's place
      under surveillance

38:49.918 --> 38:52.317
       around the clock.
        A wire tap, too.

38:55.255 --> 38:58.656
    Reg...

38:58.658 --> 39:00.290
he may have killed a guy.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.292
It gets easier
the second time.

39:02.294 --> 39:04.627
What I'm saying is
if it should come to that,

39:04.629 --> 39:06.929
you'll always have
my respect and friendship.

39:06.931 --> 39:10.832
           I'll do everything
           to bring him in safe.

39:40.029 --> 39:43.796
You want company?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.531
             How come
             you're not at work?

39:45.533 --> 39:48.033
Took a few days off.

39:48.035 --> 39:49.567
          I'm not used to seeing
          you in the daylight.

39:49.569 --> 39:50.734
       I look different?

39:54.873 --> 39:58.541
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
 I'm sorry I didn't call you.

39:58.543 --> 40:01.143
             Well, we're not in
             high school, right?

40:01.145 --> 40:04.646
I just had a tough day,
you know?

40:04.648 --> 40:08.082
     No, actually, I don't know.

40:08.084 --> 40:12.486
I just don't like talking
about work, that's all.

40:12.488 --> 40:14.020
                     Okay.

40:22.262 --> 40:24.629
             You got your place,
             I got mine.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.131
               No complications,
               and that's okay.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.033
        I'm 43 years old, I like
        to keep it simple.

40:32.837 --> 40:35.838
             I don't want to
             marry you, Vincent.

40:35.840 --> 40:38.507
        I just want to know you.

40:38.509 --> 40:39.708
             Sometimes
             I think I know you,

40:39.710 --> 40:41.109
              and then something
              like that happens

40:41.111 --> 40:45.446
           and I realize I don't
           know you at all.

40:50.185 --> 40:51.417
                You going to say
                anything?

40:51.419 --> 40:54.052
What's there to say?

40:54.054 --> 40:56.487
It's my problem, not yours.
Why make it yours?

40:59.658 --> 41:03.393
            You see? That's
            exactly what I mean.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.273
                 What's up, doc?

41:18.275 --> 41:19.941
        Check it out.
        I got something for you.

41:19.943 --> 41:21.542
   How much you looking for?

41:21.544 --> 41:23.710
          At least a grand, man.

41:23.712 --> 41:25.845
                I need some
                traveling money.

41:25.847 --> 41:28.447
    Yeah? Where you going?

41:28.449 --> 41:29.815
                        Florida.

41:29.817 --> 41:31.383
     What you going to be
       doing down there?

41:31.385 --> 41:34.018
               Well, my old man,

41:34.020 --> 41:37.154
             he manages
             a hotel down there.

41:37.156 --> 41:38.722
            He's going to get me
            a job tending bar.

41:38.724 --> 41:41.624
               One of
               those beach bars,

41:41.626 --> 41:43.659
           you know, palm trees,

41:43.661 --> 41:45.560
               right on
               the fucking sand.

41:45.562 --> 41:47.361
     I'll give you a grand
     for your Chevy Nova.

41:47.363 --> 41:50.430
               How am I going to
               get to Florida?

41:50.432 --> 41:52.064
           I can't sell my Nova.
           I love that car.

41:52.066 --> 41:53.432
       This is all shit.

41:53.434 --> 41:54.466
              All right, listen.

41:54.468 --> 41:56.935
            Look, I got
            a silver-plated .45.

41:56.937 --> 41:58.102
Bring me the piece.

41:58.104 --> 41:59.636
  Then we'll talk some money.

42:01.773 --> 42:02.938
             I'll see you later.

42:02.940 --> 42:05.674
  Dude, we never close, baby.

42:37.607 --> 42:39.640
                        [BUZZER]

42:47.816 --> 42:49.148
  Yeah?

42:49.150 --> 42:54.018
              <i> Mr. LaMarca? Joey</i>
              <i> LaMarca's father?</i>

42:54.020 --> 42:55.552
Who's this?

42:55.554 --> 42:58.021
              <i> Friend of Joey's.</i>

43:06.731 --> 43:08.497
         Who are you?

43:08.499 --> 43:10.065
           I'm Gina.

43:10.067 --> 43:13.701
    Okay, come on in, Gina.

43:22.444 --> 43:23.876
           Sit down.

43:23.878 --> 43:25.577
 You want something to drink?

43:25.579 --> 43:27.312
  No.

43:27.314 --> 43:28.846
               So, where's Joey?

43:28.848 --> 43:29.880
I don't know.

43:29.882 --> 43:30.881
                 You don't know?

43:30.883 --> 43:33.516
    When was the last time
         you saw him?

43:33.518 --> 43:37.919
I got something
that belongs to Joey.

43:37.921 --> 43:40.588
I was thinking I'd
leave it here with you.

43:40.590 --> 43:42.823
  It's just stuff Joey saved.

43:42.825 --> 43:45.692
   Kind of like a scrapbook,
           you know?

43:45.694 --> 43:47.593
How did you know
to come here?

43:47.595 --> 43:49.528
           Joey brought me once,

43:49.530 --> 43:51.696
           one day he said
           he wanted to see you.

43:51.698 --> 43:53.097
And where was I?

43:53.099 --> 43:55.666
               I don't know.
               He chickened out.

43:55.668 --> 43:57.534
              Wouldn't even
              push the doorbell.

43:57.536 --> 43:59.903
         Just like Joey, he
         wouldn't let me either.

43:59.905 --> 44:01.537
How do you get
in touch with him?

44:01.539 --> 44:04.907
          I told you.
   I don't know where he is.

44:04.909 --> 44:06.909
       You want to keep
asking me questions like that,

44:06.911 --> 44:09.111
     you're going to have
     to read me my rights.

44:09.113 --> 44:12.280
    You live in Long Beach?

44:12.282 --> 44:14.348
             Yeah.

44:14.350 --> 44:16.550
   I borrowed a friend's car
       to get down here,

44:16.552 --> 44:18.018
     so I have to get back

44:18.020 --> 44:19.219
               before she has to
               go to work.

44:19.221 --> 44:20.520
     You drove all the way
         into the city

44:20.522 --> 44:21.687
           just to give me this?

44:21.689 --> 44:24.556
          Joe's gone.

44:24.558 --> 44:27.458
That stuff was real important to
             him.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.393
         I didn't know
   what else to do with it,

44:29.395 --> 44:31.294
 and his mother don't like me,
             so...

44:31.296 --> 44:33.128
So, what do you expect me to do?

44:36.066 --> 44:38.633
    Just, like, be his dad,

44:38.635 --> 44:40.901
you know?

44:43.805 --> 44:46.672
        I've got to go.
  I'm going to get a ticket.

44:53.080 --> 44:56.081
                           Gina?

44:56.083 --> 44:58.583
          Thank you.

44:58.585 --> 45:01.118
             Sure.

46:04.048 --> 46:06.948
       I'll talk to you
         later, okay?

46:13.689 --> 46:15.255
Cheesecake?

46:19.327 --> 46:21.393
That you?

46:21.395 --> 46:23.762
                      That's me.

46:23.764 --> 46:25.196
Mom, dad?

46:25.198 --> 46:27.498
            Yeah. Connie.
            His name was Angelo.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.266
He's handsome.

46:29.268 --> 46:30.934
                       Yeah.

46:34.806 --> 46:36.071
         My old man was executed

46:36.073 --> 46:38.473
             at Sing Sing in '59

46:38.475 --> 46:42.076
          for murder.

46:42.078 --> 46:43.677
         I was eight.

46:51.219 --> 46:53.419
What happened?

46:53.421 --> 46:54.887
            He was a moving man.

46:54.889 --> 46:56.622
               He used to move
               these rich people

46:56.624 --> 47:00.025
           into mansions
           out in Locust Valley.

47:00.027 --> 47:02.060
       One way or another,
       he got himself into debt.

47:02.062 --> 47:03.261
              I guess
              it was pretty bad,

47:03.263 --> 47:04.895
              because he came up
              with this idea...

47:04.897 --> 47:11.368
           this brilliant,
           idiotic, stupid idea.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.471
             Kidnap a baby
             from a rich family.

47:14.473 --> 47:16.506
            Leave a ransom note.

47:16.508 --> 47:18.574
          They'll pay, no sweat.

47:18.576 --> 47:20.242
         So he kidnaps the baby,

47:20.244 --> 47:22.444
      and while he's waiting for
      the ransom in his car,

47:22.446 --> 47:23.711
        the baby gets tangled up

47:23.713 --> 47:25.045
                in a blanket
                in the back seat

47:25.047 --> 47:27.881
              and he suffocates.

47:27.883 --> 47:30.516
         First time they had
         a murder in Long Beach,

47:30.518 --> 47:33.886
          and it was my old man.

47:33.888 --> 47:36.355
You were
just a little kid then.

47:36.357 --> 47:38.023
It must've been hell.

47:38.025 --> 47:40.392
Yeah. You get through anything
       when you have to,

47:40.394 --> 47:44.495
         but it was...

47:44.497 --> 47:46.096
    anyway, the only thing
       that kept me sane

47:46.098 --> 47:47.931
   was the cop who arrested
          my old man

47:47.933 --> 47:49.198
      kind of adopted me.

47:49.200 --> 47:53.168
       Captain McAuley.
      He was a good guy.

47:56.841 --> 47:59.842
But this...
this the ex-wife?

47:59.844 --> 48:01.376
            Yeah, that's Maggie.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.379
Who's this?

48:04.381 --> 48:07.815
            That's my son, Joey.

48:11.620 --> 48:12.752
You have a son?

48:12.754 --> 48:14.320
                Yeah, I'm sorry.

48:14.322 --> 48:16.088
       I lied to you when I said
       I didn't have any kids.

48:16.090 --> 48:18.223
                      I'm sorry.

48:18.225 --> 48:19.457
    Why did you lie to me,
           Vincent?

48:19.459 --> 48:20.558
                   I don't know.

48:20.560 --> 48:24.628
       I hadn't seen him
        in a long time,

48:24.630 --> 48:26.329
and the divorce was a real mess,

48:26.331 --> 48:28.130
      and Maggie had been
       seeing this guy,

48:28.132 --> 48:34.235
   and, well, I don't know,
           I just...

48:34.237 --> 48:37.972
I lost control of the situation.

48:37.974 --> 48:39.006
What's that mean,
lost control?

48:39.008 --> 48:40.273
What's that, cop talk?

48:40.275 --> 48:41.941
          We used to fight a lot

48:41.943 --> 48:43.976
       with shouting and yelling
       and all that stuff,

48:43.978 --> 48:45.243
      but it never got physical,

48:45.245 --> 48:47.044
                 and then
                 one day it did.

48:47.046 --> 48:51.414
           I lost control, so...

48:51.416 --> 48:55.884
  I, of course, regretted it,
            and...

48:55.886 --> 48:57.985
  but we never got over that.

49:00.622 --> 49:01.687
           On top of everything,

49:01.689 --> 49:02.988
        I think my son
     might've killed a guy

49:02.990 --> 49:04.456
     in a fight over drugs
       the other night.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.491
    What?

49:06.493 --> 49:08.292
            I'm just trying to
            tell you everything.

49:12.264 --> 49:15.865
Yeah, okay, okay.

49:20.637 --> 49:21.636
Why haven't you seen him?

49:21.638 --> 49:24.271
    Well, I tried at first,

49:24.273 --> 49:25.939
          but Maggie
    made it very difficult.

49:25.941 --> 49:27.774
       I could only have
    these supervised visits

49:27.776 --> 49:29.509
     with a social worker
         watching me,

49:29.511 --> 49:30.676
    like I was a criminal.

49:30.678 --> 49:32.878
    It was like I was back
        going to prison

49:32.880 --> 49:35.614
      to see my old man.

49:35.616 --> 49:38.617
      I couldn't take it,
          you know...

49:38.619 --> 49:40.619
So you just
stopped seeing him?

49:40.621 --> 49:42.287
   Well, not just like that.

49:42.289 --> 49:45.623
    I mean, Maggie was also
     doing a number on him

49:45.625 --> 49:48.993
      so he didn't really
     want to be around me,

49:48.995 --> 49:55.265
and I just walked away, I quit.

49:55.267 --> 49:58.968
Maybe I should've tried harder.
         I don't know.

49:58.970 --> 50:04.072
Why couldn't you
tell me this before?

50:04.074 --> 50:06.007
          Well, I...

50:06.009 --> 50:08.743

01:17:30.929 --> 01:17:34.130
    You plead self-defense,

01:17:34.132 --> 01:17:35.131
   you've got a good chance

01:17:35.133 --> 01:17:38.167
        of getting off
     with maybe six years.

01:17:39.136 --> 01:17:41.970
        What if it matters to me
        what you believe?

01:17:41.972 --> 01:17:44.672
   I've got to take you in.
        You know that.

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:56.016
             What are you, a cop
             or my father?

01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:57.617
           I'm both.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:02.487
Joey...

01:18:02.489 --> 01:18:04.589
        I'm getting out of here,
        so what are you now?

01:18:04.591 --> 01:18:05.590
        Joey, come on.

01:18:05.592 --> 01:18:06.958
  I'm just fucking with you.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.859
      I knew the answer.

01:18:13.498 --> 01:18:17.966
  You know, when I was a kid,
     I wanted to be a cop.

01:18:17.968 --> 01:18:20.435
         I really did.

01:18:20.437 --> 01:18:22.069
        Just like you.

01:18:27.275 --> 01:18:32.478
       Joey! Joey! Joey!

01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:46.657
                Chief.

01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:47.991
               Where's your boy,
               Vince?

01:18:47.993 --> 01:18:50.560
  Picasso worked for a dealer
        called Spyder.

01:18:50.562 --> 01:18:53.095
      Spyder's after Joey
  to get his four grand back.

01:18:53.097 --> 01:18:55.530
  Joey told me he saw Spyder

01:18:55.532 --> 01:18:56.831
in the alley
by the casino

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.265
right after Reg
was hit.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.734
Why didn't you read your boy his
        rights and bring him in?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.269
He told me he didn't kill Reg.

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.670
                   And you
                   believed him?

01:19:04.672 --> 01:19:05.971
Yeah, I did.

01:19:05.973 --> 01:19:07.339
           Of course
   you want to believe him.

01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:10.208
            Chief,
 I've been a cop for 25 years.

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:12.410
 The operative word is "cop."

01:19:12.412 --> 01:19:13.878
       That doesn't mean
    you're sometimes a cop

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.146
         and sometimes
     some junkie's father.

01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:18.281
            You're either a cop
            or you're not a cop.

01:19:18.283 --> 01:19:20.950
                   End of story.

01:19:20.952 --> 01:19:22.685
       This is bullshit.

01:19:22.687 --> 01:19:24.920
      Lieutenant LaMarca,
    you're a sworn officer.

01:19:24.922 --> 01:19:26.588
        Your under oath
    to perform your duties.

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:27.922
In terms of this investigation--

01:19:27.924 --> 01:19:32.826
      What investigation?
You already made your mind up.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.668
            Don't be playing
            no bullshit neither.

01:19:48.174 --> 01:19:49.907
  It's a motherfucking ghost.

01:19:49.909 --> 01:19:51.975
How come you're still breathing,
            Casper?

01:19:51.977 --> 01:19:56.412
  Listen, $1,000 for my Nova.

01:19:57.915 --> 01:20:00.282
         Cops got your
  motherfucking wheels, boy.

01:20:00.284 --> 01:20:02.183
         Listen, I'm sorry, man.

01:20:02.185 --> 01:20:04.251
          Will you do me a solid
          here, please?

01:20:04.253 --> 01:20:05.852
                    I need help.

01:20:05.854 --> 01:20:08.154
            Please.

01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:11.990
       What's the ring?

01:20:11.992 --> 01:20:16.360
     It's a football ring,
    but it ain't for sale.

01:20:16.362 --> 01:20:17.494
     Come on, let me see.

01:20:20.332 --> 01:20:22.598
     Listen, this is worth
     like a hundred, easy,

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.665
 but I'm saving it for my son.

01:20:23.667 --> 01:20:27.168
Mm-hmm.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.903
All right, look, we'll treat it
          like a loan

01:20:28.905 --> 01:20:30.905
        until I get you
 the hundred back, all right?

01:20:30.907 --> 01:20:32.172
Yeah, sure.

01:20:32.174 --> 01:20:34.007
                      All right.

01:20:34.009 --> 01:20:35.975
             Here.

01:20:35.977 --> 01:20:39.445
  No, Carl, I can't use this.

01:20:39.447 --> 01:20:40.679
       I need cash, bro.
       I can't use this.

01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:43.515
    You're the first junkie
      who couldn't, then.

01:20:43.517 --> 01:20:45.383
Come on, give me the ring back.

01:20:45.385 --> 01:20:47.151
Hey, hey, hey,
back the fuck off!

01:20:47.153 --> 01:20:49.119
         You're lucky
 I'm giving your ass anything.

01:20:49.121 --> 01:20:51.154
 All right, but Carl, please,
that fucking ring is important.

01:20:51.156 --> 01:20:52.355
       It's for my boy.

01:20:52.357 --> 01:20:53.856
     You ain't going to be
      around long enough

01:20:53.858 --> 01:20:55.057
       to see your boy.

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:57.292
You ain't going to no
fucking Florida, neither.

01:20:57.294 --> 01:20:59.894
  You got Spyder and the cops
    chasing after your ass.

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:01.128
       You're a junkie.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.830
Only place you're going
is to the morgue.

01:21:03.832 --> 01:21:05.865
     County, motherfucker!

01:21:16.477 --> 01:21:17.909
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?

01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:19.310
   There's nothing in there
       for you, mister.

01:21:19.312 --> 01:21:22.046
                      Come here.

01:21:22.048 --> 01:21:25.482
                Come over
                and see my soup.

01:21:25.484 --> 01:21:27.484
   Oh, look, here's Grandpa.

01:21:27.486 --> 01:21:29.552
             Hey.

01:21:29.554 --> 01:21:31.120
         This is Evelyn Hancock.

01:21:31.122 --> 01:21:32.287
             She's an
             old friend of mine.

01:21:32.289 --> 01:21:34.055
        Hi there. Wow.

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:36.223
               You're a big boy,
               Angelo.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.691
Evelyn is with Child Services.

01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:38.992
What's going on?

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:42.395
          She's taking Angelo
          until Gina comes back.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:44.430
         Just a temporary thing.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.497
She's not coming back.

01:21:45.499 --> 01:21:49.366
   I can't take care of him.

01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:51.568
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:52.969
                     Yeah, sure.

01:21:52.971 --> 01:21:54.503
Go see this nice lady.

01:21:54.505 --> 01:21:57.739
  I just want to talk to him
         for a minute.

01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.342
             What are you doing?

01:22:03.344 --> 01:22:04.676
What am I supposed
to do with him?

01:22:04.678 --> 01:22:07.445
         Take care of him.
         You're his grandfather.

01:22:07.447 --> 01:22:09.280
That's a nice idea,
but come on, I can't.

01:22:09.282 --> 01:22:11.749
 Look, Vincent, Gina is gone.

01:22:11.751 --> 01:22:13.383
            You think his father
            is coming back?

01:22:13.385 --> 01:22:14.817
    Look, Evelyn will take
       good care of him.

01:22:14.819 --> 01:22:16.218
That's the best thing for him.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.486
   No, you're the best thing
      for him right now.

01:22:18.488 --> 01:22:19.887
I can help you if you need me.

01:22:19.889 --> 01:22:22.623
Michelle, you've never had kids.
You don't know what it's like.

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:24.558
    I can't believe you can
  just walk away from Angelo.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.725
I'm not walking...

01:22:25.727 --> 01:22:27.059
         Walking away?

01:22:27.061 --> 01:22:28.560
        You told me you
    walked away from Joey.

01:22:28.562 --> 01:22:29.661
     I'm not walking away!

01:22:29.663 --> 01:22:32.363
            That's what you told
            me you did before.

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:33.430
          Walk away?

01:22:37.502 --> 01:22:39.435
             Let me
             show you something.

01:22:40.871 --> 01:22:42.136
                 Let me show you
                 something.

01:22:44.874 --> 01:22:47.207
You think I want him growing up
          with this?

01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:48.875
       Like he's the son
   of fucking Frankenstein?

01:22:48.877 --> 01:22:51.444
     Watch out, here comes
       the LaMarca kid.

01:22:51.446 --> 01:22:53.212
               You never know
               what he might do.

01:22:53.214 --> 01:22:54.947
          There's LaMarca, don't
          mention his father!

01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:56.715
     Call it walking away
         if you want,

01:22:56.717 --> 01:22:59.584
         but I'm doing
 the best thing for this kid.

01:22:59.586 --> 01:23:01.252
   That is not about Angelo,
           Vincent.

01:23:01.254 --> 01:23:03.153
       That's about you.

01:23:03.155 --> 01:23:04.921
         You told me.

01:23:04.923 --> 01:23:08.324
   You told me you never had
       a choice, right?

01:23:08.326 --> 01:23:10.059
   Well, now you've got one
          right here.

01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:13.228
 Michelle, try to understand.

01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:15.196
   Right now, it's just more
      than I can handle.

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.430
        I can't do it.

01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:28.674
 That's how you make a choice.

01:23:28.676 --> 01:23:30.942
Goodbye.

01:23:47.627 --> 01:23:51.629
        I want my mom!

01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:00.763
     If there are no other
        questions here,

01:25:00.765 --> 01:25:02.231
  let's try to wrap this up,
          gentlemen.

01:25:02.233 --> 01:25:04.733
     We've got some pretty
substantial evidence to go on.

01:25:04.735 --> 01:25:06.267
    Fingerprints are clear
       and unambiguous,

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:09.069
    and there are no others
          on the gun.

01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:11.071
  Shell casings, ballistics,
     all identify the gun

01:25:11.073 --> 01:25:12.472
   as the shooter's weapon.

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.541
     We know Joey LaMarca
    frequented the carousel

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:16.142
     and used drugs there.

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:17.643
        Excuse me, sir.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:18.977
Go ahead, Dave.

01:25:18.979 --> 01:25:20.845
There's a shoeprint in the blood
      at the crime scene

01:25:20.847 --> 01:25:23.147
            doesn't match
            LaMarca's shoe size.

01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:24.615
     So, what do we think?

01:25:24.617 --> 01:25:25.849
     That O.J. was there?

01:25:25.851 --> 01:25:29.185
Maybe Bruno Magli?

01:25:29.187 --> 01:25:30.953
        One last thing.
  This kid has killed twice.

01:25:30.955 --> 01:25:32.888
    Don't give him a chance
        to do it again.

01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:36.491
We got that?

01:25:45.101 --> 01:25:46.633
                            Hey!

01:25:46.635 --> 01:25:48.835
     You got a phone call.

01:25:48.837 --> 01:25:50.636
   Some putz is calling you
         on my phone.

01:25:50.638 --> 01:25:52.237
  How come you're giving out
       my phone number?

01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:53.738
I don't even know your number,
             Herb.

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.039
   Well, this guy knows it.

01:25:59.177 --> 01:26:02.311
 Make sure you leave a nickel
        in the ashtray.

01:26:06.416 --> 01:26:08.516
            Hello?
                Dave Simon, sir.

01:26:08.518 --> 01:26:10.951
 Tell your neighbor I'm sorry,
  I couldn't call you direct.

01:26:10.953 --> 01:26:13.253
    Yeah. What's going on?

01:26:13.255 --> 01:26:16.189
       I have something
  you should take a look at.

01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:18.124
   <i> Could we meet in the city?</i>

01:26:18.126 --> 01:26:20.726
         <i> Corner of York</i>
  <i> and the 59th Street Bridge?</i>

01:26:20.728 --> 01:26:21.960
          <i> It's copies</i>
     <i> of crime scene photos</i>

01:26:21.962 --> 01:26:24.162
     <i> I tried to talk about</i>
          <i> in briefing.</i>

01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:21.469
           Help me.

01:39:21.471 --> 01:39:25.406
         Joey! Joey...

01:39:38.086 --> 01:39:39.819
               Dad! Dad, are you
               all right?

01:39:39.821 --> 01:39:41.387
           I'm okay.
    It's just my shoulder.

01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:43.955
                 I didn't do it.

01:39:43.957 --> 01:39:45.523
I know you didn't, Joey.

01:39:46.859 --> 01:39:48.458
Get rid of the guns.

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.293
Empty your pockets.

01:39:50.295 --> 01:39:51.827
Don't give them an excuse.

01:39:51.829 --> 01:39:53.795
      Dad, they're going
          to kill me.

01:39:53.797 --> 01:39:55.229
           It's okay, it's okay.
           I'm with you now.

01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:57.231
      Identify yourself!

01:39:57.233 --> 01:40:01.868
             It's okay.
             It's okay, no guns.

01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:03.502
               Raise your hands.
               Raise your hands.

01:40:03.504 --> 01:40:05.470
                  See the hands?
                  No guns.

01:40:05.472 --> 01:40:07.872
Get down,
drop the gun!

01:40:07.874 --> 01:40:11.008
    We're down. We're down.
      The hands are here.

01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:12.175
             Move away from him!

01:40:15.813 --> 01:40:18.680
    Take it easy with him!
         Take it easy!

01:40:18.682 --> 01:40:22.383
   Anything happens to him,
   then you'll answer to me.

01:40:22.385 --> 01:40:23.851
        Easy with him!
        Easy with him!

01:40:23.853 --> 01:40:25.719
                He's going to be
                all right.

01:40:25.721 --> 01:40:26.820
        It's okay, son.

01:40:26.822 --> 01:40:28.588
                      It's okay.

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:51.770
  I want to go on the rocks.

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.238
                 Yeah, those are
                 the rocks.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.741
               That's the jetty.

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:59.076
    Let's go on the rocks.

01:41:59.078 --> 01:42:02.279
                 Yeah, those are
                 the rocks.

01:42:02.281 --> 01:42:06.115
                 Look, see that?

01:42:06.117 --> 01:42:10.185
              You see that,
              the airplane? See?

01:42:10.187 --> 01:42:14.088
              Where do you think
              that's going?

01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:17.591
         You want to fly away
         with your dad sometime?

01:42:17.593 --> 01:42:20.193
          Yeah? Because he wants
          to go with you.

01:42:20.195 --> 01:42:23.162
                  He told me so.

01:42:23.164 --> 01:42:27.498
          He told me he wants to
          take you to Key West.

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:30.267
                 You want to go?
                 Yeah? Good.

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:33.803
 When he comes back,
 you'll go with him to Key West.

01:42:33.805 --> 01:42:38.741
               Me, you, and him.

01:42:38.743 --> 01:42:41.443
        Grandpa, Daddy, and you,

01:42:41.445 --> 01:42:43.878
              we are going
              to go to Key West.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:48.916
         Okay? Okay, sweetheart.

01:42:48.918 --> 01:42:51.351
       You want to put the water
       in the thing?

01:42:51.353 --> 01:42:55.121
                Go put the water
                in the thing.

01:42:59.326 --> 01:43:03.328
            [ ¶¶¶ ]

01:43:17.009 --> 01:43:24.781
   ¶ Red sails in the sunset
     Way out on the sea ¶

01:43:24.783 --> 01:43:32.822
   ¶ Oh, carry my loved one
      Home safely to me ¶
