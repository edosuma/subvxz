00:01.971 --> 00:05.480
Thank you, Anna. For your great blessing
that you have shown this colony.

00:05.913 --> 00:08.460
By coming here
and asking us for help,

00:08.540 --> 00:11.480
you have reminded us
of what we live for. Kindness.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.040
- You got my money ?
- What about drugs ?

00:20.920 --> 00:21.960
What do you mean ?

00:22.040 --> 00:23.760
I can get hold of some. A lot.

00:24.279 --> 00:26.640
Go get my money !

00:26.720 --> 00:28.413
He sent you, didn't he ?

00:28.493 --> 00:29.640
- Who ?
- You know who.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.000
Do you have a million or not ?

00:31.089 --> 00:33.040
You show me the drugs.
And I'll show you the cash.

00:35.721 --> 00:38.280
- Where's that shitload of cocaine ?
- I told you I don't have it.

00:40.029 --> 00:41.345
Where's the package ?

00:41.425 --> 00:44.356
You got until midnight.
Just you and the package.

00:44.436 --> 00:46.960
If you're late, or that cop's
anywhere nearby...

00:47.040 --> 00:49.720
You know what happens
to your wife and kids.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.560
You owed someone money.
Is it something to do with Mexico ?

01:00.240 --> 01:01.920
I did a bad thing,

01:02.360 --> 01:04.040
a very bad thing.

01:12.380 --> 01:17.500
The same day

04:12.740 --> 04:14.900
What's it like being here ?

04:14.980 --> 04:18.820
What's it like waking up
and not remembering ?

04:18.899 --> 04:23.300
Who it is that you've hurt,
that you can't live without no more ?

04:23.380 --> 04:25.740
Anna, she's had enough.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.020
Think she'd be better off alone
than with a dad like you.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.260
Jack !

04:56.780 --> 05:01.020
TIN STAR

06:08.860 --> 06:11.460
Tonight ?

06:11.540 --> 06:15.300
- The cops are after me.
- You're being ridiculous.

06:15.380 --> 06:18.540
I gotta get out of this town
so I can give you until midnight.

06:18.620 --> 06:21.460
- Midnight ?
- Midnight.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.900
You do not want to blackmail us.

06:25.660 --> 06:28.540
Blackmail is your thing.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.820
I'm here to fulfill
a verbal agreement.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.500
Nice one.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.780
Do you think all that paint-ball
shit's gonna get me back ?

08:21.420 --> 08:24.100
Just trying to get your attention.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.060
What's that ?

08:40.780 --> 08:43.179
Where did you get this ?

08:48.540 --> 08:51.020
Where did you get this ?

08:53.980 --> 08:55.940
Si.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.780
Who ?

09:01.660 --> 09:03.660
Whitey.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.900
Look after her for me, alright ?

10:45.300 --> 10:48.260
- Hey.
- Hey

11:17.380 --> 11:19.340
How's Anna ?

11:22.180 --> 11:25.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:30.540 --> 11:31.740
How are you ?

11:49.900 --> 11:52.220
I miss him.

11:53.220 --> 11:55.300
I miss Pete.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.540
Yeah.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.500
Yeah. Me too.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.620
So.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.940
I think I have a job for you.

13:58.140 --> 14:01.620
So you left me up there,
on a mountain.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.300
Yeah, I did.

14:09.620 --> 14:13.260
I had a choice to make.
And I chose Anna.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.140
I'll always choose Anna.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.580
Come on.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.340
- Nice.
- Yeah.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.660
I don't know what it is.
Or how to sell it.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.100
Why don't we just rob a bank ?

14:46.180 --> 14:49.020
- How many drug deals have you done ?
- Loads.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.660
- How many banks have you robbed ?
- None.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.340
There we are then.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.540
- You're sure about this ?
- Yep.

15:01.900 --> 15:06.220
No, Jesus ! Jack you're not supposed
to take the whole lot ! Jesus Christ.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.140
Bowls.

15:50.060 --> 15:54.940
Excuse me, Brittany,
you have any baby powder ?

15:55.500 --> 15:59.060
- You mean talcum powder ?
- No, you mean formula.

15:59.140 --> 16:02.300
Sure ! I'll show you right
to the baby section.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.340
Not that one...

16:07.860 --> 16:11.060
- You folks expecting ?
- Expecting what ?

16:11.140 --> 16:13.700
- Grandparents.
- No.

16:13.780 --> 16:17.220
- How old is the baby ?
- I've no idea.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.900
- Is it an infant or toddler ?
- Does it matter ?

16:19.980 --> 16:22.900
Okay, folks, we have
regular or organic.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.500
The organic is a lot pricier

16:24.580 --> 16:28.180
but it comes with a hundred percent
all natural ingredients.

16:28.860 --> 16:32.140
Not sure we give a fuck, Brittany.
Do we give a fuck ?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.500
I don't think we do, Brittany.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.620
Thanks, Brittany.

17:03.180 --> 17:06.700
- Excuse me...
- Sorry...

17:10.660 --> 17:12.660
Right.

17:17.380 --> 17:21.740
So you take the drugs, and you cut
them open, then you pour it out,

17:21.819 --> 17:24.780
and then you get a tub of baby powder
and you pour that out.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.420
- The whole lot ?
- The whole lot.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.820
And then you mix it up and you chop it
up, and you pour half the mix back in,

17:29.980 --> 17:32.060
and then the rest in a new brick.

17:32.140 --> 17:35.340
And then you wrap it up, tape it up.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.300
Right. You put the drugs
back in the well.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.500
Done.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.380
Game's five card stud.
Buy-in's forty grand. Cash only.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.500
House takes ten percent. My partner
will exchange the bills for chips.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.700
You will deposit the cash in the safe.

17:54.780 --> 17:56.420
You will escort the player
to the table.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.300
And you will watch these jokers
at all times.

17:58.380 --> 18:01.620
Anything goes missing
I'll hold you responsible.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.740
- You taking a rake ?
- I told you. Ten percent.

18:03.820 --> 18:06.380
That's illegal.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.940
Why did you leave the army ?

18:09.020 --> 18:11.420
- Dismissed with disgrace.
- You ?

18:15.460 --> 18:18.820
I take it this level of misconduct
precludes these gentlemen

18:18.900 --> 18:21.460
working for a legitimate security firm.

18:21.540 --> 18:23.940
Well, then. Maybe our best bet
is to shut the fuck up

18:24.020 --> 18:26.500
and do what we're fucking well told.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.260
Fuck off.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.220
Those guys creep me out.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.500
Game needs protection,
sweetheart.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.700
We've got bank debts to settle

18:42.780 --> 18:45.380
and we won't be opening
a new bar at Kickstarter.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.580
How and where are two old farts like us
going to start again ?

18:48.660 --> 18:51.060
South of France.
Saint Marie de La Mer.

18:51.140 --> 18:55.380
Fucking hell, sweetheart, they've have
wild horses there. I've seen pictures.

18:55.460 --> 18:59.180
- Dreams, Frank.
- Yeah, what's wrong with dreams ?

18:59.940 --> 19:04.100
Why not the Caribbean ?
No. Fuck that, Mauritius.

19:04.180 --> 19:08.500
Hey, come here, you.
I'm seeing one now.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.100
- You in a thong.
- Me in a thong ?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.780
Yeah, why not ? Ass like yours.

19:14.860 --> 19:19.020
You're mixing rum and coke
in a seaside...

19:19.100 --> 19:21.660
Cabana.

19:22.380 --> 19:26.940
I'm serious, as soon as we're good
to go, we go. No fucking about.

19:28.340 --> 19:32.180
You're one silver tongued motherfucker.
You know that ?

19:33.780 --> 19:34.860
Get this show on the road.

20:48.780 --> 20:52.100
- Afternoon, officer.
- Good afternoon, sir.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.380
- Can I see some ID please.
- Right.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.340
Thank you.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.660
Sir, have I done anything wrong ?

21:08.860 --> 21:12.020
Could you step out of the car,
please, sir ?

21:13.140 --> 21:17.700
Thank you. And move away
from the vehicle.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.500
If you could walk towards
the vehicle, please, sir.

21:22.580 --> 21:23.820
There's nothing in there.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.340
No, just keep walking towards
the vehicle, please, sir.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.660
- What's she...
- Walk towards the vehicle, please, sir.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.580
Thank you.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.380
If you could
just assume your position.

21:42.420 --> 21:45.700
Step into the vehicle, please, sir !

21:45.780 --> 21:48.140
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21:48.220 --> 21:51.460
Want you to put both hands
on the wheel, please.

21:51.540 --> 21:55.460
- I got the sandwich.
- Enjoy your sandwich, sir.

22:05.380 --> 22:08.580
- Where to ?
- Peckham.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.060
We don't go south of the river.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.180
Shit.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.740
- Hi.
- Alright ?

22:53.060 --> 22:54.340
Hi.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.820
- She's talking to someone.
- I fucking knew it.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.460
She's a fucking honey trap.

23:00.540 --> 23:03.260
- You wanna shut down the game ?
- Fuck the game.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.220
That cunts not here to play poker.
Follow her.

23:10.540 --> 23:14.140
You two, get ready.

23:14.620 --> 23:18.500
- You driving a cab for a living now ?
- These are lean times.

23:18.580 --> 23:21.540
I'd give you need a ride,
but I got one in.

23:22.780 --> 23:26.540
You two sweethearts giving it
a second chance ?

23:34.700 --> 23:39.100
- I hope you're very happy together.
- Thank you !

23:40.420 --> 23:42.620
I like your friend.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.940
- You alright ?
- I'm alright. You alright ?

23:49.020 --> 23:50.500
- Yeah.
- Good.

23:50.580 --> 23:55.180
- You got this ?
- Yeah, I got this. Here.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.180
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.580
Fuck it, Jack.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.100
Bring her in.

25:55.060 --> 25:57.300
Alright.

26:01.660 --> 26:05.140
- What sort of a cunt you take me for ?
- The usual kind ?

26:06.780 --> 26:08.660
- Hundred and fifty ?
- Yeah ? Fuck off.

26:11.660 --> 26:12.980
Hundred and forty.

26:13.060 --> 26:16.580
I thought the honey trap
was amateur but this...

26:17.220 --> 26:19.140
- Hundred and thirty...
- Turning up in a taxi mate ?

26:19.220 --> 26:22.900
This is the worst
sting operation in history.

26:28.140 --> 26:31.380
Hundred and twenty nine.
Final offer.

26:31.980 --> 26:34.980
No wonder they fucking retired you.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.580
Fuck this. Sit down.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.740
Fuck.

26:55.260 --> 26:57.580
Tell me my name.

26:57.660 --> 27:00.660
- Elaine ?
- Funny.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.540
- It's Frank.
- Yeah.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.940
- Simon's uncle right ?
- Right. Simon's uncle.

27:07.020 --> 27:11.060
- This is for Simon and Helen.
- Hang on a sec, hang on.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.100
- Helen fucking hated you.
- What are you talking about ?

27:15.180 --> 27:17.140
- She hated you.
- No, she didn't.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.620
She did. She said you couldn't
keep your fucking hands off her.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.580
- You shut up.
- You used to fuck your sister.

27:22.660 --> 27:24.340
Fuck you !

27:31.340 --> 27:33.380
You have no fucking idea...

27:49.460 --> 27:52.340
You got this, do you ?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.700
More or less, yeah.

27:56.580 --> 28:00.900
I really need a piss.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.820
You should have gone
before you got in the car.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.780
- Didn't think it would take that long.
- Jesus, Jack.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.300
I know, I'm sorry.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.100
- Can I have a go ?
- Yeah.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.020
Thanks, love.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.980
- Hurry up, would you ?
- Alright.

28:28.380 --> 28:31.140
Fucking hell.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.580
- Frank.
- Angela.

28:37.660 --> 28:39.620
Nearly done.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.540
Won't be a minute.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.620
You run out of towels.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.580
Sorry about that.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.140
Shit.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.020
Bingo.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.320
Hands !

30:16.800 --> 30:20.160
How can you be married
to a man like that ?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.720
He's going to let you down.

30:22.800 --> 30:27.360
Lie to you. Hurt you.
Destroy everything you care about ?

30:30.360 --> 30:33.400
- Fuck !
- Jesus.

30:36.240 --> 30:40.320
- You alright ?
- Yeah, grand. It's just weird.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.840
Fuck a duck.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
Come here...

31:13.480 --> 31:17.320
Alright ? Yeah. Him.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.360
- What ?
- That was insane.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.440
- You fucking loved it though.
- I did not.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.200
You were fucking great in there.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.720
- Was I ?
- Fuck, yeah.

32:27.800 --> 32:31.080
- Fuck, yeah ?
- Fuck, yeah.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.160
Fuck, yeah !

33:21.880 --> 33:25.160
Jesus, get in the back.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.000
Christ.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.880
- You okay ?
- No.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.000
He's the prince of lies, sweetheart.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.440
Can't trust a fucking word
that comes out of his mouth.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.720
I know. Come with me.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.720
- I'll follow you.
- What do you mean, you'll follow me ?

36:23.800 --> 36:27.560
I'm gonna clean up here.
Lose ends.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.200
Lose ends, right ?

36:33.160 --> 36:36.120
He's more a part of you
than I am, isn't he ?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.480
Yeah.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.880
I'm in.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.120
- Did you find the drugs ?
- No.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.520
I searched everywhere.
Shall I keep looking ?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.320
It's Jack I want.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.840
She said she'd be here by midnight.
Where the fuck is she ?

38:21.440 --> 38:23.600
I don't know.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.760
Jesus Christ ! You didn't do
anything to her, did you ?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.000
Nothing illegal.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.280
Promise me !

38:44.960 --> 38:48.680
Yeah, I promise.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.080
You got a spoon ?

39:08.200 --> 39:10.120
Thanks.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.600
What the fuck is that ?

39:32.480 --> 39:34.240
A bullet.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.760
Yeah. What's it doing in the fridge ?

39:39.160 --> 39:41.240
I don't know.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.200
Let's go shopping.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.240
Hey, darling.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.720
What you doing here ?

41:21.520 --> 41:23.800
It's a long story.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.520
You okay ?

41:43.760 --> 41:45.880
Alright ?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.320
Alright.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.960
If I asked you to do something for me,
would you ?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.080
Name it.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.280
What are we doing here ?

42:43.360 --> 42:46.320
Right, so, when I said I put the drugs
back in the well right...

42:46.400 --> 42:48.800
I might have lied a little bit.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.760
- There you go.
- You hid the drugs here ?

43:13.160 --> 43:14.720
Hang on.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.280
Fuck.

43:25.640 --> 43:28.000
Shit.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.200
Jesus Christ.
