WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:05.108
<i>We should have high winds
more often.</i>

00:05.108 --> 00:07.317
I'm supposed to be
landing the plane right now.

00:07.317 --> 00:08.870
Well, I guess the Island

00:08.870 --> 00:10.941
wanted us to spend
the afternoon together.

00:10.941 --> 00:12.667
Ah, good island.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.772
Very good.

00:13.772 --> 00:14.773
But I should go.

00:14.773 --> 00:16.050
The helicopter landed

00:16.050 --> 00:17.534
on the other side of the island
an hour ago,

00:17.534 --> 00:19.674
and the vehicles are gonna get
to the office soon.

00:19.674 --> 00:21.124
- I'll drive you.
- Okay.

00:21.124 --> 00:23.057
So tomorrow
is Helene's birthday.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.197
- Yeah, I know.
- She wants something simple.

00:25.197 --> 00:28.373
I was thinking maybe
just the three of us?

00:28.373 --> 00:29.891
Dinner?

00:29.891 --> 00:31.548
- Three?
- Uh-huh.

00:31.548 --> 00:33.723
Oh, I'd like that.

00:33.723 --> 00:36.691
Mm, good.

00:36.691 --> 00:38.624
- Mm.
- Yeah.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.391
- See ya.
- Yeah.

00:46.391 --> 00:47.668
Hey, Ruby.

00:47.668 --> 00:50.395
Mm, afternoon delight?

00:50.395 --> 00:51.844
Maybe.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.709
Javier invited me
to join him and Helene

00:54.709 --> 00:56.159
for her birthday dinner tomorrow.

00:56.159 --> 00:57.850
Ooh!

00:57.850 --> 00:59.887
Dinner with the daughter?
That's so big.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.544
It's not a big deal.
It's just a dinner.

01:01.544 --> 01:03.270
It's a simple dinner.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.788
Mm-hmm.

01:04.788 --> 01:07.205
You know, the way you say
"mm-hmm" is very annoying.

01:07.205 --> 01:09.724
Hey, well, it's just nice
to see you happy.

01:15.523 --> 01:18.008
Do you have bug spray?
I don't care for bugs.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.562
I assume a place like this
has big ones.

01:19.562 --> 01:21.667
You know, most guests find
it's not a problem.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.566
Welcome, Dr. Nancy Lee.

01:23.566 --> 01:25.015
I'm your host.
I'm Elena Roarke.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.914
This is my associate, Ruby.

01:26.914 --> 01:28.605
And I hear
you're a therapist.

01:28.605 --> 01:29.951
Yeah, an exhausted one.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.815
I saw clients today,
then traveled

01:31.815 --> 01:33.541
halfway across the world
in the helicopter,

01:33.541 --> 01:34.646
then the Jeep.

01:34.646 --> 01:35.854
Well, I'm sure
you'd like to rest.

01:35.854 --> 01:36.958
Correct.

01:36.958 --> 01:39.271
So my fantasy
can start tomorrow.

01:39.271 --> 01:41.308
Of course.
We'll talk in the morning.

01:45.484 --> 01:46.899
She's fun.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.970
Well, everyone has
their story.

01:52.595 --> 01:54.424
Oh, this is amazing.

01:54.424 --> 01:56.323
You have no idea
how excited we are to be here.

01:56.323 --> 01:59.291
Mr. Hernandez, Mr. Gold,
welcome to Fantasy Island.

01:59.291 --> 02:00.948
I am your host, Elena Roarke.

02:00.948 --> 02:02.294
This is my associate, Ruby.

02:02.294 --> 02:04.227
We are so happy to be here.

02:04.227 --> 02:05.642
I can't believe we made it.

02:05.642 --> 02:08.335
He's giddy because
we never get to go on vacation.

02:08.335 --> 02:10.233
I planned, like,
three in the last year,

02:10.233 --> 02:12.270
and this is the first one
we actually get to take.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.754
My fault. Work.

02:13.754 --> 02:15.480
No, it's okay.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.964
All that matters
is that we're here now.

02:16.964 --> 02:19.139
Mm, and that's what counts.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.554
Let's go to my office.

02:20.554 --> 02:22.003
Come on.

02:22.003 --> 02:24.799
So tell me,
what can the Island do for you?

02:24.799 --> 02:26.905
- Well, the thing is, I--
- Well, we're so in love that--

02:26.905 --> 02:29.804
Um, sorry. You go.

02:29.804 --> 02:31.185
Are you sure?

02:31.185 --> 02:34.326
Yeah, totally. It's all you.

02:34.326 --> 02:36.708
Well, um, Oliver and I

02:36.708 --> 02:38.710
have been together
for three years,

02:38.710 --> 02:40.953
and we used to talk all day,
every day,

02:40.953 --> 02:42.507
about everything.

02:42.507 --> 02:46.649
And lately, we just haven't
been connecting the same way.

02:46.649 --> 02:50.204
Well, Emilio works so much,
so there just isn't the time.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.344
Well, it's not just work.

02:52.344 --> 02:54.381
No. It's both of us.

02:54.381 --> 02:55.968
Absolutely, it's both of us.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.626
Um, we miss each other.

02:58.626 --> 03:02.596
Our fantasy would be to be
together with no distractions.

03:02.596 --> 03:03.631
Wonderful.

03:03.631 --> 03:05.806
Your fantasy begins now.
- Oh.

03:05.806 --> 03:08.049
There's a bottle of champagne
waiting in your suite.

03:08.049 --> 03:09.948
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

03:09.948 --> 03:11.467
Oliver,
I have a question for you

03:11.467 --> 03:13.296
regarding
your dietary restriction.

03:13.296 --> 03:14.987
Oh.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.299
Babe, I'll see you
in the suite, okay?

03:16.299 --> 03:17.369
Yeah.

03:21.753 --> 03:22.719
Do you think
he suspects anything?

03:22.719 --> 03:24.687
No, not a thing.

03:24.687 --> 03:26.689
Um, what am I missing?

03:26.689 --> 03:30.106
Oliver has his own fantasy,
and it is a secret.

03:30.106 --> 03:33.972
My fantasy is to give Emilio
the perfect marriage proposal.

03:33.972 --> 03:35.974
Oh, how romantic.

03:35.974 --> 03:37.596
You're so in love.

03:37.596 --> 03:38.770
More than that.

03:38.770 --> 03:41.186
I actually like him, you know?

03:41.186 --> 03:43.015
He--he's kind. He's thoughtful.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.224
He's hilarious.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.674
And he has a great sense
of direction,

03:46.674 --> 03:47.986
which I very much do not.

03:47.986 --> 03:50.022
So complete package.
- Aw.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.093
Of course,
no relationship is perfect.

03:52.093 --> 03:53.405
Yeah, ours is pretty close.

03:53.405 --> 03:55.925
I make sure of that.
- Hmm, okay.

03:55.925 --> 03:59.894
Oh, um,
here are your instructions.

03:59.894 --> 04:01.413
I know it's a lot, but...

04:01.413 --> 04:03.381
- I'll handle it.
- Go to sleep.

04:03.381 --> 04:05.037
You pop the question tomorrow.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.867
Ah!

04:06.867 --> 04:08.765
- Go.
- Oh, right. Bye.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.081
Oh.

04:14.081 --> 04:16.704
This all feels
a bit more straightforward

04:16.704 --> 04:18.465
than usual, no?

04:18.465 --> 04:21.537
Time will tell.

04:21.537 --> 04:22.572
Hmm.

04:45.906 --> 04:48.874
Mm.

04:48.874 --> 04:50.669
We're still in paradise.

04:50.669 --> 04:52.119
Oh, just you wait.

04:57.435 --> 04:58.919
Ah, nature.

04:58.919 --> 05:01.301
Hmm, nature.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.337
Come here.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.822
Not interested!

05:05.822 --> 05:07.237
Uh, actually, you might be.

05:07.237 --> 05:09.067
I know what this is.

05:12.415 --> 05:14.348
Hello.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.661
Good morning, gentlemen.

05:16.661 --> 05:18.973
I wanted to bring this
to you myself,

05:18.973 --> 05:20.354
get your day started right.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.012
Okay, we have waffles,
coconut syrup, fresh fruit,

05:23.012 --> 05:25.946
guava juice, and green tea.

05:25.946 --> 05:27.050
All my faves.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.018
Yep, that's why
I ordered them.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.123
Oh!

05:31.123 --> 05:32.539
Uh, okay, I'm--

05:32.539 --> 05:34.541
I'm gonna have to get you
a new tablecloth.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.818
I'm sorry.
- Oh, absolutely not.

05:35.818 --> 05:37.198
No, it--it--it's fine.

05:37.198 --> 05:38.545
It's usually one of us
knocking things over,

05:38.545 --> 05:41.306
so this is a relief.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.480
He's right.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.620
This is perfect.

05:46.691 --> 05:48.382
And it's only
just the beginning.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.487
Oh?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.697
Hmm.

05:54.181 --> 05:55.493
Look, I believe in therapy.

05:55.493 --> 05:57.495
I'm committed to the process.

05:57.495 --> 05:59.876
Clients need to find solutions themselves.

05:59.876 --> 06:00.912
But?

06:00.912 --> 06:03.052
But I know more
than they do.

06:03.052 --> 06:04.881
And I know how that sounds.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.193
I promise it's not conceit.

06:06.193 --> 06:08.885
I've just been doing this
a long time.

06:08.885 --> 06:12.510
I know what people need
within three minutes.

06:12.510 --> 06:14.374
Isn't everyone's story
different?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.720
Oh, we all wanna think that.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.928
We wanna believe

06:16.928 --> 06:19.102
that we are some rare,
beautiful flower.

06:19.102 --> 06:22.036
- What are we?
- Dandelions, every one of us.

06:22.036 --> 06:23.348
No one has
an original problem.

06:23.348 --> 06:24.384
And I've seen it all.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.557
The solutions don't work

06:25.557 --> 06:27.214
if clients don't get there themselves.

06:27.214 --> 06:29.423
So I have to wait for them
to catch up,

06:29.423 --> 06:30.424
you know, months, years.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.736
I just...

06:31.736 --> 06:33.116
I just wanna help people quickly.

06:33.116 --> 06:36.257
Okay, so then
what can the Island do for you?

06:36.257 --> 06:38.570
My fantasy is to tell people

06:38.570 --> 06:41.401
what their problem is,
you know?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.126
Just name it...
- Mm.

06:43.126 --> 06:45.232
Without all this time wasted
talking about it,

06:45.232 --> 06:48.200
no-holds-barred,
so that they can fix it.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.583
- That sounds very satisfying.
- Doesn't it?

06:51.583 --> 06:53.689
So we'll arrange for you
to meet some new clients here,

06:53.689 --> 06:56.208
and you can tell them
exactly what's on your mind.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.107
You can counsel at will.

07:00.247 --> 07:01.869
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

07:01.869 --> 07:04.113
Okay.

07:04.113 --> 07:05.390
Let's start with you.

07:05.390 --> 07:07.150
So this whole
"do it all yourself,"

07:07.150 --> 07:09.049
uh, walled off
from your emotions...

07:09.049 --> 07:11.051
- Oh, I--
- It'll bite you in the ass,

07:11.051 --> 07:12.811
especially since it's obvious

07:12.811 --> 07:15.780
there are people
that you care about

07:15.780 --> 07:17.782
and wanna be closer to.

07:17.782 --> 07:19.300
Oh, that's--

07:19.300 --> 07:22.234
that's my boyfriend
and his daughter.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.892
We are very close.

07:24.892 --> 07:27.930
In fact, we're actually
all going to dinner tonight.

07:27.930 --> 07:29.103
You know,
it's okay to show people

07:29.103 --> 07:30.967
your soft, mushy center.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.453
My--let's--okay,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.765
my mushy what?
- Center.

07:35.765 --> 07:39.424
We could have a session
right now and get to it.

07:39.424 --> 07:41.771
Well, uh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

07:41.771 --> 07:44.602
But you see, um,
therapy isn't really my thing.

07:44.602 --> 07:46.983
But I am sure you're gonna help
so many people

07:46.983 --> 07:48.122
during your time here.

07:48.122 --> 07:50.470
Your call.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.092
Mushy center.

07:55.095 --> 07:57.373
Okay, you've got this.
You look amazing.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.995
- Thank you.
- Don't worry. Oh, he's here.

07:58.995 --> 08:00.272
Oh.
Here, here, here, here, here.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.481
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.967
You're not wearing
the blue shirt

08:04.967 --> 08:06.106
I picked out for you?

08:06.106 --> 08:08.315
Yeah,
I was in a yellow mood.

08:08.315 --> 08:10.179
Wait, you're being weird.

08:10.179 --> 08:11.594
First you wanna get here
before me,

08:11.594 --> 08:14.355
and now you care
about the color of my shirt?

08:14.355 --> 08:15.805
- The yellow looks great.
- Hmm.

08:15.805 --> 08:17.324
Come on. Let's get a drink.

08:17.324 --> 08:19.015
Oh, sounds great.

08:19.015 --> 08:21.362
Oh, my God.

08:22.363 --> 08:23.710
Oh.

08:23.710 --> 08:26.885
Wait, is this one of those
song and dance bars?

08:26.885 --> 08:29.025
I don't know.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.789
Is it?

08:33.789 --> 08:35.445
Oh, no.

08:35.445 --> 08:37.344
What is happening?

08:42.004 --> 08:43.626
Interesting choice.

08:52.497 --> 08:54.982
Oh, wow.

09:02.887 --> 09:04.267
Oh, don't hurt yourself.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.407
I wanted to get
your attention!

09:06.407 --> 09:07.547
You've got it.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.825
Good, because...

09:12.759 --> 09:15.002
Emilio Hernandez,

09:15.002 --> 09:18.903
you have changed my life
beyond measure.

09:18.903 --> 09:20.732
Will you marry me?

09:23.390 --> 09:24.978
Um...

09:24.978 --> 09:25.979
Emilio?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.708
Oliver, I'm sorry,
I--I can't.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.572
I can't.

09:41.063 --> 09:42.616
So there's a part of me
that even thought,

09:42.616 --> 09:44.722
"Maybe we should keep
the roller coaster here."

09:44.722 --> 09:46.413
Permanently, you know?

09:47.621 --> 09:50.244
Oh, I am so sorry, Helene.

09:50.244 --> 09:52.764
You know, I'm rambling on
about island stories,

09:52.764 --> 09:56.457
and it's your birthday,
so we should focus on you.

09:57.873 --> 10:00.461
Did you do anything fun today?

10:00.461 --> 10:02.636
Not really.
Just took it easy.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.810
Well, that can be nice.

10:03.810 --> 10:05.605
She said
she wanted a chill day.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.089
Well, I am so happy

10:07.089 --> 10:08.331
that you included me
in your birthday dinner.

10:08.331 --> 10:11.058
Yeah, it was
kind of his idea, so...

10:11.058 --> 10:12.059
Oh.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.722
But tha--thank you
for coming.

10:19.722 --> 10:21.068
Yeah, of course.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.211
Oliver?

10:29.732 --> 10:31.147
You all right?

10:31.147 --> 10:32.666
He got his own room,
didn't he?

10:32.666 --> 10:33.667
I'm sorry.

10:35.842 --> 10:37.775
Everything was fine
when we got here.

10:37.775 --> 10:40.467
I tried so hard
to make everything perfect.

10:40.467 --> 10:43.504
I don't know what I did wrong.

10:43.504 --> 10:44.816
I thought this island
was supposed to

10:44.816 --> 10:46.438
fulfill people's fantasies.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.649
Well, sometimes it just
takes a minute to get there.

10:54.515 --> 10:55.689
Thanks.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.347
I'll check on you tomorrow, okay?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.648
What?

11:25.201 --> 11:28.308
Mm.

11:28.308 --> 11:30.828
We're still in paradise.

11:30.828 --> 11:34.003
Yeah,
but I thought you were--

11:36.005 --> 11:38.525
Ah, nature.

11:41.631 --> 11:44.704
Okay, I'll get it.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.710
Hi.
- Ooh.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.332
Good morning, gentlemen.

11:52.332 --> 11:54.679
I wanted to bring this to you myself,

11:54.679 --> 11:56.163
get your day started right.

11:56.163 --> 11:58.890
Okay, I have waffles,
coconut syrup, fresh fruit,

11:58.890 --> 12:00.996
guava juice, and green tea.

12:00.996 --> 12:02.998
- All my faves.
- Mm-hmm.

12:02.998 --> 12:04.931
- What's going on?
- Oh!

12:04.931 --> 12:08.003
Uh, okay, I'm--I'm gonna have
to get you a new tablecloth.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.314
I'm sorry.
- Oh, absolutely not.

12:09.314 --> 12:10.660
No, it--it--it's fine.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.076
It's usually one of us
knocking things over,

12:12.076 --> 12:13.663
so this is a relief.

12:13.663 --> 12:16.390
Okay.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.151
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

12:20.394 --> 12:22.742
- Miss Roarke!
- Yeah.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.709
I think
I'm reliving yesterday.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.918
Like, I'm in some sort of--
- Like a time loop?

12:26.918 --> 12:28.092
Yeah, you and me both.

12:28.092 --> 12:29.714
We're stuck.

12:29.714 --> 12:30.888
Huh?

12:35.237 --> 12:37.135
Why are you acting like you
didn't know this would happen?

12:37.135 --> 12:39.068
Because I didn't know
it was gonna happen.

12:39.068 --> 12:42.140
Oh, good to know. It's fine.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.521
I love time loop movies.

12:43.521 --> 12:44.798
"Groundhog Day" is a classic,

12:44.798 --> 12:46.766
but "Edge of Tomorrow"
really broke new ground.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.077
- Uh, uh, okay.
- And according to

12:48.077 --> 12:50.770
my deep knowledge
of time loops,

12:50.770 --> 12:52.150
I need to change something.

12:52.150 --> 12:53.911
Or learn something.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.913
Emilio was fine
when we arrived.

12:55.913 --> 12:57.155
Then I proposed.

12:57.155 --> 12:58.778
So you think the proposal
is the issue?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.883
Exactly.
I made it all about me.

13:00.883 --> 13:03.334
I need to make it about
what Emilio wants.

13:03.334 --> 13:06.095
- Uh, uh, maybe.
- I'm gonna fix this.

13:06.095 --> 13:09.996
I'm gonna get us back
to, you know, linear time.

13:09.996 --> 13:11.756
After last night,
I'd be so happy

13:11.756 --> 13:13.413
with a do-over myself.

13:13.413 --> 13:15.242
Operation Time Loop
is underway.

13:15.242 --> 13:16.968
Okay. Uh, what?

13:16.968 --> 13:18.073
- Bump it.
- Oh.

13:19.695 --> 13:22.318
- We can workshop the title.
- Yeah, please. Gotta go.

13:27.116 --> 13:29.463
Is everything okay?

13:29.463 --> 13:31.017
Fantastic.

13:31.017 --> 13:32.190
Yeah, no-holds-barred therapy.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.158
I'm helping people
at warp speed.

13:34.158 --> 13:35.745
Huh.

13:35.745 --> 13:36.816
Do they feel helped?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.335
Real change is scary and hard

13:39.335 --> 13:41.855
and often doesn't feel good
at first.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.926
Can't argue with that.

13:43.926 --> 13:46.964
So, uh, empty chair.

13:46.964 --> 13:49.449
Wanna take a seat?

13:49.449 --> 13:50.760
Hard pass, but thanks.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.279
Okay, let me know
if you wanna talk

13:52.279 --> 13:55.524
about why the, uh,
Mr. Nice Guy Helper personality

13:55.524 --> 13:57.491
might not work out
in the long run.

13:59.735 --> 14:01.219
Hmm.

14:02.980 --> 14:04.878
Did you have fun?

14:04.878 --> 14:07.053
I did. Did you?

14:07.053 --> 14:09.124
Of course. I was with you.

14:11.298 --> 14:12.886
You know,
sometimes it just feels like

14:12.886 --> 14:15.820
you're trying so hard.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.546
I don't want you
to have to try with me.

14:17.546 --> 14:20.998
Well, the truth is,

14:20.998 --> 14:23.966
I've been
a little distracted lately.

14:23.966 --> 14:25.623
What are you doin'?

14:27.349 --> 14:29.178
Emilio Hernandez,

14:29.178 --> 14:33.079
you have changed my life
beyond measure.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.875
Will you marry me?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.602
Um, Oliver,
this is really nice.

14:39.602 --> 14:41.363
Thanks.
Kinda what I was going for.

14:41.363 --> 14:43.399
And I wanna say yes...

14:43.399 --> 14:47.196
Yet the tone of your voice
tells me you're not going to.

14:47.196 --> 14:49.060
I don't think I can.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.579
I'm sorry, I...

15:02.418 --> 15:04.179
Damn!

15:04.179 --> 15:06.560
Mm.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.837
What's wrong?

15:07.837 --> 15:11.013
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

15:12.566 --> 15:14.914
Ah, nature.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.639
Spoiler alert:

15:16.639 --> 15:19.125
that's gonna be breakfast.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.126
I'll get it.

15:23.612 --> 15:25.890
Hello.

15:25.890 --> 15:27.719
Good morning, gentlemen.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.480
I wanted to bring this to you myself,

15:29.480 --> 15:31.206
get your day started right.

15:31.206 --> 15:34.312
Okay, I have waffles,
coconut syrup, fresh fruit,

15:34.312 --> 15:36.521
guava juice, and green tea.

15:37.867 --> 15:38.938
All my faves.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.284
- Mm-hmm.
- Yup!

15:40.284 --> 15:42.148
Ooh!

15:42.148 --> 15:45.047
Island air makes
your reflexes really sharp.

15:50.811 --> 15:51.916
Oh.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.265
Um, Elena?
- Yeah.

15:56.265 --> 15:58.336
I need to ask you something.

15:58.336 --> 16:01.374
Something feels off
about today,

16:01.374 --> 16:03.065
and--and I don't--

16:03.065 --> 16:05.274
do you feel it,
or am I just imagining it?

16:05.274 --> 16:06.827
You're not imagining it.

16:06.827 --> 16:10.417
The Island is making us relive
the same date over and over.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.591
It's for Oliver.

16:11.591 --> 16:14.559
Oh, okay.

16:14.559 --> 16:17.183
That makes total sense.

16:17.183 --> 16:18.770
This didn't happen
at my old job.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.186
Can I ask for a favor?

16:20.186 --> 16:22.912
Can you find out Helene's
favorite birthday cake?

16:22.912 --> 16:24.811
- Sure, sure.
- Great.

16:24.811 --> 16:27.503
Oh, you've been reliving
that dinner, haven't you?

16:27.503 --> 16:28.711
Yes, I have.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.506
How's it going?

16:30.506 --> 16:32.750
Well, she told Javier
she wanted something simple,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.441
but simple isn't cutting it,

16:34.441 --> 16:37.341
so tonight, I am going big.

16:37.341 --> 16:38.825
Oh.

16:38.825 --> 16:41.793
I swear I told her simple.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.624
This is, uh, not that.

16:44.624 --> 16:47.489
Happy birthday, Helene.

16:47.489 --> 16:49.215
That's quite a cake.

16:49.215 --> 16:50.457
It's chocolate raspberry,

16:50.457 --> 16:52.011
which I have it
on good authority

16:52.011 --> 16:53.184
is your favorite.

16:54.565 --> 16:56.670
I made it myself.
- Wait.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.569
You baked this cake?
- Yes, I did.

16:58.569 --> 17:01.330
Elena Roarke baked a cake?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.990
You--you shouldn't
have done this.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.475
Oh, it was actually fun
once I got into it.

17:08.475 --> 17:09.476
It's okay.

17:13.687 --> 17:15.586
I'm sorry.

17:15.586 --> 17:18.313
- Okay, I--
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

17:18.313 --> 17:19.383
Helene.

17:35.571 --> 17:36.917
- Hi.
- Oh, morning!

17:36.917 --> 17:39.265
I was gonna bring you two
breakfast in bed.

17:39.265 --> 17:40.921
- I need your help.
- Okay, of course.

17:40.921 --> 17:42.509
It's Emilio.
I need you to figure out

17:42.509 --> 17:45.374
what his perfect
marriage proposal would be,

17:45.374 --> 17:47.342
like, in an ideal world.

17:48.722 --> 17:50.828
Other than all that singing
and dancing

17:50.828 --> 17:52.864
and props I've been arranging?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.625
Yes, fair.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.006
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you for that.

17:57.006 --> 17:58.870
It's all wrong.
I need to start over.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.735
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm--I'm confused.

18:01.735 --> 18:03.634
Would you believe me
if I told you that the Island

18:03.634 --> 18:06.430
is making me relive
the same day over and over

18:06.430 --> 18:10.882
until I figure out why Emilio
keeps rejecting my proposal?

18:10.882 --> 18:13.057
What?

18:14.507 --> 18:18.787
- Hmm.
- Oh, I would believe that.

18:18.787 --> 18:20.927
I'll let you know
what I find out.

18:23.723 --> 18:25.897
How would you believe that?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.554
Okay, I'm actually
getting dizzy.

18:27.554 --> 18:29.798
You're making me nervous,
and I'm dizzy.

18:29.798 --> 18:32.490
Movies about abduction
start this way, you know.

18:32.490 --> 18:35.459
I know, I know.
We're almost there.

18:35.459 --> 18:36.977
Okay, and stop.

18:36.977 --> 18:38.324
- Okay.
- You can take it off.

18:38.324 --> 18:39.808
Mm.

18:41.465 --> 18:43.915
Oh, my God, what is this?

18:43.915 --> 18:46.159
You love camping!
You never get to!

18:46.159 --> 18:48.989
Yeah, because you said
you'd rather eat glass.

18:48.989 --> 18:50.715
Okay, vacations should have
indoor showers.

18:50.715 --> 18:51.992
I still stand by that.

18:51.992 --> 18:55.134
But I wanted to do something
that you like.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.342
Wow.

18:56.342 --> 18:58.309
Plus, ingredients
for s'mores.

18:58.309 --> 19:00.691
God, it's like
you read my mind.

19:00.691 --> 19:01.795
You know, I always thought
this would be

19:01.795 --> 19:02.934
the perfect setup to-

19:02.934 --> 19:04.315
Get engaged?

19:06.421 --> 19:08.975
Oliver, how did you...

19:08.975 --> 19:10.321
This is all for you.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.980
I wanted you to know
that this is for you.

19:18.433 --> 19:21.574
Emilio, will you marry me?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.854
Um...

19:25.854 --> 19:27.511
okay.

19:27.511 --> 19:30.445
Yeah, I will marry you.

19:30.445 --> 19:33.482
What? Really? Yes? Yes?

19:33.482 --> 19:34.483
- Yeah.
- He said yes!

19:34.483 --> 19:35.519
- Oh.
- He said yes!

19:35.519 --> 19:38.107
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm-hmm!

19:38.107 --> 19:40.006
Mm!

19:40.006 --> 19:41.835
Ahh!

19:44.666 --> 19:47.462
No! It's not fair!

19:47.462 --> 19:49.843
I got a yes!

19:49.843 --> 19:51.155
What yes?

19:51.155 --> 19:53.502
What's not fair?

19:53.502 --> 19:55.711
Oh, shut up!

19:55.711 --> 19:58.058
Yeah, I don't think
the bird understands.

19:59.681 --> 20:02.373
Will you get that?
It's breakfast.

20:02.373 --> 20:04.548
Um, sure.

20:10.864 --> 20:12.694
Hello.

20:12.694 --> 20:14.213
Morning, gentlemen.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.007
I wanted to bring this to you myself,

20:16.007 --> 20:17.699
get your day started right.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.701
I have waffles, coconut syrup,

20:19.701 --> 20:22.221
fresh fruit, guava juice,
and green tea.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.671
- All my faves.
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.127
Good morning.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.235
That's one opinion.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.271
Oof.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.548
You know, recently,
I've been told

20:39.548 --> 20:42.965
I have a Mr. Nice Guy
helpful personality,

20:42.965 --> 20:45.174
and that maybe
that's not such a good thing.

20:45.174 --> 20:47.867
But anything I can do to help?

20:47.867 --> 20:49.765
Can you tell me why
my boyfriend's sister

20:49.765 --> 20:51.698
sent him
a text message last night

20:51.698 --> 20:53.976
asking if he's broken up
with me yet?

20:54.736 --> 20:56.910
Oof, ouch.

20:59.327 --> 21:03.641
They talk about everything,
including me, I guess.

21:03.641 --> 21:06.748
I was working so hard
to create the perfect proposal,

21:06.748 --> 21:09.716
but he's been planning
on breaking up with me

21:09.716 --> 21:12.132
this whole time.

21:12.132 --> 21:14.134
I need to know why.

21:16.344 --> 21:17.552
I think I might know someone

21:17.552 --> 21:19.623
who can help you
figure out why.

21:24.938 --> 21:28.770
So everything was fine
in the relationship

21:28.770 --> 21:30.530
before this trip,
before you proposed?

21:30.530 --> 21:32.118
Right.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.637
Interesting take.

21:34.638 --> 21:36.674
As opposed to what?

21:36.674 --> 21:39.298
How do you expect
someone to love you

21:39.298 --> 21:41.507
when you clearly
aren't being honest with him?

21:41.507 --> 21:44.164
Um, what?

21:44.164 --> 21:45.649
Who are you?

21:45.649 --> 21:46.960
Am I wrong?

21:46.960 --> 21:48.824
Yes, you're wrong.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.896
I would never lie to Emilio.

21:51.896 --> 21:53.588
Oh.

21:53.588 --> 21:55.348
What would I lie about?

21:55.348 --> 22:00.111
So you are always happy
all the time?

22:00.111 --> 22:01.423
No one's, like,
really happy all the time.

22:01.423 --> 22:02.666
Do you tell him?

22:03.874 --> 22:06.877
I'm sure when...

22:06.877 --> 22:08.913
it's something big enough,
I do.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.504
Don't I?

22:13.504 --> 22:16.369
So when
was your last argument?

22:16.369 --> 22:18.129
Um, never.

22:19.165 --> 22:20.960
I don't like to fight.

22:20.960 --> 22:26.483
Oliver, being unhappy
and pretending that you're not,

22:26.483 --> 22:27.863
that's lying.

22:30.901 --> 22:34.145
Why don't you tell Emilio
when things bother you?

22:34.145 --> 22:35.457
I don't know.

22:35.457 --> 22:36.838
Finding that answer
is more important

22:36.838 --> 22:40.117
than the answer
that you want from Emilio.

22:44.846 --> 22:46.537
This is fun, right?

22:46.537 --> 22:48.884
Nice way
to spend your birthday?

22:48.884 --> 22:50.334
Yeah, it's great.

22:51.853 --> 22:54.200
Any plans for tomorrow?

22:54.200 --> 22:57.306
I don't know yet.

22:57.306 --> 23:01.656
Um, Helene,
I can't help noticing

23:01.656 --> 23:03.796
it seems like something
is troubling you.

23:06.971 --> 23:08.594
Can I help?

23:08.594 --> 23:10.216
Uh, I--

23:10.216 --> 23:12.218
I don't think it's something
that you can help with.

23:12.218 --> 23:14.013
So there is something?

23:15.290 --> 23:19.328
It's just--it's--
it's just not working.

23:19.328 --> 23:21.503
- What isn't?
- This. This.

23:21.503 --> 23:24.092
Me--me being here.

23:25.334 --> 23:26.922
Why not? I don't understand.

23:26.922 --> 23:28.372
What...

23:28.372 --> 23:30.236
A few weeks ago,
you had no idea

23:30.236 --> 23:31.720
that I even existed.

23:33.239 --> 23:34.723
Okay, you already have
this whole life here,

23:34.723 --> 23:37.519
with her...

23:37.519 --> 23:39.279
that I--

23:39.279 --> 23:41.765
I don't fit into.

23:41.765 --> 23:43.698
I don't fit in anywhere.

23:46.355 --> 23:48.081
You know, may--

23:48.081 --> 23:49.635
maybe I just need
to get off this island.

23:49.635 --> 23:52.085
I don't--I shouldn't
be here anymore.

23:52.085 --> 23:53.880
Helene, wait.

24:01.301 --> 24:03.303
Thank you, papi.

24:03.303 --> 24:06.203
Isn't it a little early
to be drinking?

24:06.203 --> 24:09.378
Is it?
It's, like, 74 o'clock.

24:09.378 --> 24:10.656
True.

24:10.656 --> 24:12.278
And my dinner didn't get
any better, okay?

24:12.278 --> 24:16.455
- Hmm.
- So, Tomas, a mimosa, please.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.560
And keep them coming.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.424
Ruby can handle
my other guests.

24:20.424 --> 24:22.357
She can, right?
- Totally.

24:22.357 --> 24:25.153
- Should I take a day off?
- Take all the days off.

24:25.153 --> 24:26.154
Cheers.

24:27.949 --> 24:29.433
Down the hatch.

24:32.298 --> 24:33.920
Oh, this feels good.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.129
Needs more booze.

24:36.129 --> 24:38.028
I've just been doing this
a long time.

24:38.028 --> 24:40.168
I know what people need
within three minutes.

24:40.168 --> 24:42.791
There are no surprises.

24:42.791 --> 24:46.001
Something about today
just feels odd, doesn't it?

24:46.001 --> 24:48.107
You feel it?
- What makes you think that?

24:48.107 --> 24:50.281
Well, for one,
Elena's taking the day off,

24:50.281 --> 24:52.007
and that never happens.

24:52.007 --> 24:55.873
But also, I just--I feel it.

24:55.873 --> 24:58.773
It's probably, um, my tattoo.

24:58.773 --> 25:01.016
The what now?

25:01.016 --> 25:04.848
Oh, the--my tattoo
on my back.

25:04.848 --> 25:07.022
Yeah.

25:07.022 --> 25:09.715
Right.

25:09.715 --> 25:12.062
I'm actually 75.

25:12.062 --> 25:14.547
I was closeted my whole life,

25:14.547 --> 25:16.273
and I was about to die,

25:16.273 --> 25:18.862
so the Island made me young,

25:18.862 --> 25:22.141
if I stayed, which I did.

25:22.141 --> 25:24.626
But I just, um, broke up
with my girlfriend,

25:24.626 --> 25:28.147
which is, um, sad
but also exciting.

25:28.147 --> 25:30.459
And sometimes
when things here are off,

25:30.459 --> 25:33.462
my, uh, tattoo kind of tingles.

25:33.462 --> 25:36.396
It's, uh, tingling.

25:38.019 --> 25:39.572
Interesting.

25:42.195 --> 25:43.921
You didn't.

25:43.921 --> 25:46.234
I did, right to his face.

25:46.234 --> 25:50.687
I said, "If you insist
on making me watch

25:50.687 --> 25:54.138
'The Lord of the Rings,'
this date is over."

25:54.138 --> 25:55.484
What did he do?

25:55.484 --> 25:57.521
He called me a taxi.

25:57.521 --> 25:59.350
He really liked that movie.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.250
Oh, my God.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.184
Then I met Emilio
a week later.

26:05.184 --> 26:07.220
Aww.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.395
Aw.

26:09.395 --> 26:10.948
I'm hungry.

26:10.948 --> 26:12.709
Tomas, we need...

26:12.709 --> 26:13.951
Okay.

26:13.951 --> 26:16.195
Fries, the tuna poke cones,

26:16.195 --> 26:17.886
a bacon cheeseburger,
and a brownie sundae.

26:17.886 --> 26:19.198
You like sweets?
- Yes.

26:19.198 --> 26:20.199
Two brownie sundaes, please.

26:20.199 --> 26:21.925
- Wh--
- Thank you.

26:21.925 --> 26:23.409
What are you doing?

26:23.409 --> 26:26.343
Everything resets
in the morning,

26:26.343 --> 26:29.898
including
the comfort food calories.

26:29.898 --> 26:32.176
So there you have it.
Look at this.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.972
Oh, so hot.

26:34.972 --> 26:37.112
All right,
then I need a menu too.

26:37.112 --> 26:38.735
Tomas!

26:38.735 --> 26:40.288
My friend needs a menu.

26:40.288 --> 26:41.703
This is an odd feeling.

26:41.703 --> 26:44.085
I don't know
what to say to you.

26:44.085 --> 26:45.949
Well, see?

26:45.949 --> 26:48.054
Some stories
can still surprise you.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.887
Why do you think
it's so important to you

26:52.887 --> 26:54.923
to believe
that you heard it all?

26:54.923 --> 26:58.064
Has something changed lately?

26:58.064 --> 26:59.928
Hmm, yeah.

26:59.928 --> 27:02.586
I'm tired.

27:02.586 --> 27:05.762
Listening to people all day,
it's--it's draining.

27:05.762 --> 27:09.110
Sounds really hard, Nancy.

27:09.110 --> 27:12.596
I think part of me thought
that if I could just...

27:12.596 --> 27:14.494
fix people fast enough...

27:14.494 --> 27:18.015
You wouldn't have to listen
so much and wait so long

27:18.015 --> 27:21.363
for people's light bulbs
to finally switch on.

27:21.363 --> 27:24.746
And you could save
some energy for yourself.

27:24.746 --> 27:27.093
Yeah.

27:27.093 --> 27:29.302
When is someone gonna listen
to me?

27:29.302 --> 27:30.683
Well, I'm here.

27:32.754 --> 27:34.998
I'll listen to you.

27:37.863 --> 27:42.488
Well, I've been thinking
a lot about my mom lately.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.765
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:43.765 --> 27:45.318
Oh.

27:45.318 --> 27:46.872
What's she like?

27:51.117 --> 27:53.395
Mmm!

27:53.395 --> 27:56.191
I can't believe
I had to come all the way here

27:56.191 --> 27:57.883
for the best chocolate cake

27:57.883 --> 28:01.162
that I've ever had
in my whole life.

28:01.162 --> 28:04.303
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.170
I'm finally starting
to enjoy myself.

28:09.170 --> 28:11.034
It--it took you this long?

28:11.034 --> 28:12.380
What are you talking about?

28:12.380 --> 28:13.830
It's still the first day.

28:15.383 --> 28:18.386
Oh, God.
- Please, stop.

28:18.386 --> 28:21.044
- It is nice, though.
- What?

28:21.044 --> 28:22.666
I don't really
get to relax much.

28:22.666 --> 28:24.357
Same.

28:28.051 --> 28:30.985
Your legs, they're insane.

28:30.985 --> 28:32.331
Do you have any idea

28:32.331 --> 28:35.714
how completely fabulous
you are?

28:35.714 --> 28:38.061
I do.

28:38.061 --> 28:39.407
- Okay.
- Thank you.

28:39.407 --> 28:44.239
Well, well, well,
what is this?

28:44.239 --> 28:46.690
My boyfriend, having fun.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.588
What? Where?
I don't see him.

28:48.588 --> 28:52.661
Emilio, we're practicing
our ability to let go.

28:52.661 --> 28:53.662
- Oh.
- Yup.

28:53.662 --> 28:54.663
Oh, seems like you're, uh,

28:54.663 --> 28:55.872
practicing a lot.

28:55.872 --> 28:58.081
We're very
dedicated students.

28:58.081 --> 29:00.739
You know what?
I should let go.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.569
No holding back,
because there's no better time

29:03.569 --> 29:05.571
than now.

29:05.571 --> 29:06.745
Yes.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.920
In fact,
I'm late for dinner.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.715
I gotta go.

29:11.715 --> 29:14.062
Oh, okay.

29:14.062 --> 29:15.374
- I'm good.
- Oh.

29:15.374 --> 29:16.789
Okay.

29:20.068 --> 29:22.899
I'm sure Elena
is gonna be here any minute.

29:22.899 --> 29:24.072
Hey. Hola.

29:24.072 --> 29:26.385
Hey.

29:26.385 --> 29:29.388
Hello. Helene, let's talk.

29:29.388 --> 29:32.425
- Uh, sure.
- Okay.

29:32.425 --> 29:34.807
Elena, are you--
you feeling okay? You--

29:34.807 --> 29:36.602
Um, oh, I--
I feel all kinds of things.

29:36.602 --> 29:40.709
For instance, I'm... drunk.

29:40.709 --> 29:44.265
I'm also--I'm very confused.

29:44.265 --> 29:46.232
Well, that makes two of us.

29:46.232 --> 29:49.788
I've been trying to give you
the birthday that you want,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.825
but you keep
not liking anything.

29:52.825 --> 29:56.518
Um, uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:56.518 --> 29:58.624
You know how hard it is
for me to--

29:58.624 --> 30:01.178
to show my soft, mushy center?

30:01.178 --> 30:03.422
I--I don't do this.

30:03.422 --> 30:06.597
But he loves you,
and I love him.

30:07.771 --> 30:12.120
And we're gonna have
to make this work.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.466
Hmm?
- Wait. Wait, hold on.

30:13.466 --> 30:15.020
You love me?
- I mean, you--

30:15.020 --> 30:16.400
you're not gonna remember
that I said anything,

30:16.400 --> 30:18.747
but...

30:18.747 --> 30:21.647
yeah, I love you.

30:22.648 --> 30:24.615
Well, I'm not sure
you'll remember it,

30:24.615 --> 30:26.307
but I love you too.

30:26.307 --> 30:28.171
Aww.

30:28.171 --> 30:29.689
This is a conversation
that I--I--

30:29.689 --> 30:31.346
Do you know how hurt
he's gonna be

30:31.346 --> 30:32.623
if you leave this island?

30:32.623 --> 30:33.693
- What?
- What? I'm not gonna--

30:33.693 --> 30:35.488
I saw it happen. Hmm?

30:35.488 --> 30:36.696
I saw it happen.

30:36.696 --> 30:38.871
I don't know--
I don't know why. Why?

30:38.871 --> 30:41.494
What--what do you want?

30:41.494 --> 30:43.013
Just say it! What do you want?

30:43.013 --> 30:45.153
I want my birthday back!

30:53.196 --> 30:57.856
My birthday is me and my mom.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.616
She bakes my favorite cake.

30:59.616 --> 31:01.687
Chocolate raspberry.

31:01.687 --> 31:03.482
Yeah.

31:05.380 --> 31:07.210
We sit,

31:07.210 --> 31:10.627
we eat it together,
and we talk.

31:10.627 --> 31:11.800
She's gone.

31:11.800 --> 31:16.184
And I--it hurts.

31:17.841 --> 31:19.498
And every time
I look across the table,

31:19.498 --> 31:22.225
she's--she's not there.

31:25.159 --> 31:28.472
You're there.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.647
You just remind me,

31:30.647 --> 31:32.338
every time I see you,

31:32.338 --> 31:34.582
how much I miss her.

31:37.896 --> 31:42.072
I understand now.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.560
And I am so very sorry.

31:54.119 --> 31:55.672
Okay.

31:58.847 --> 32:00.228
Elena.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.956
Elena.

32:08.409 --> 32:10.238
Oh, you must have ESP.

32:10.238 --> 32:11.550
Not exactly.

32:14.104 --> 32:15.105
Okay.

32:15.105 --> 32:16.417
You ready for the big day?

32:16.417 --> 32:17.418
Oh, change in plans.

32:17.418 --> 32:18.764
I'm not proposing.

32:20.352 --> 32:22.630
- Oh. Um...
- No, it's fine.

32:22.630 --> 32:26.910
Will you tell Roarke that
I've decided to stay stuck?

32:26.910 --> 32:29.257
I'm so--
I'm--I'm not following.

32:29.257 --> 32:31.432
We're in a time loop.

32:31.432 --> 32:34.780
Oh! [laughs] Got it.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.403
But wait, if you stay stuck,

32:37.403 --> 32:39.578
doesn't that mean
the rest of us do too?

32:39.578 --> 32:43.823
Yeah, about that,
I figured it out.

32:43.823 --> 32:46.067
I do nothing,
this day goes on forever,

32:46.067 --> 32:47.758
Emilio doesn't
break up with me,

32:47.758 --> 32:50.244
and I get to spend the rest
of my life with the man I love.

32:50.244 --> 32:53.454
Oliver, that doesn't sound
like a good plan.

32:53.454 --> 32:56.319
Have a great day, again.

32:56.319 --> 32:57.699
Bye.
- Oh!

33:01.358 --> 33:03.671
You know,

33:03.671 --> 33:05.466
I think I wanna get some lunch.

33:05.466 --> 33:06.605
What?

33:06.605 --> 33:08.331
Well, no,
we just had breakfast.

33:08.331 --> 33:10.126
No, this is so much fun.

33:10.126 --> 33:13.094
No, you're right.
I can wait.

33:17.236 --> 33:18.341
What?

33:18.341 --> 33:21.102
I just heard myself.

33:21.102 --> 33:22.862
Maybe I am a liar.

33:27.246 --> 33:30.456
- Hmm.
- Uh, give me a minute, okay?

33:30.456 --> 33:32.044
Yeah, sure.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.809
I am not changing my mind.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.053
Oh, I get it.
Don't blame you.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.848
I've tried to run away
from stuff too.

33:42.848 --> 33:44.953
I'm not running away.

33:44.953 --> 33:46.955
Oliver, can I offer
an observation?

33:46.955 --> 33:48.474
I'm not sure I can stop you.

33:48.474 --> 33:50.649
Ever since you arrived,
you try to make your life

33:50.649 --> 33:52.237
appear like it's perfect.

33:52.237 --> 33:55.412
No cuts, no bumps, no conflict.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.829
Yeah, Nancy kinda said
the same thing.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.039
Why do you think that is?

34:01.039 --> 34:02.661
I don't know.

34:02.661 --> 34:04.318
I think you do.

34:04.318 --> 34:06.009
You're scared of something.

34:06.009 --> 34:07.976
And I've gotten to know you
a little,

34:07.976 --> 34:10.634
and I want you
to hear something.

34:10.634 --> 34:13.637
You are fabulous.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.161
I know you can beat it.

34:20.161 --> 34:22.163
Hmm.

34:22.163 --> 34:23.992
That's what I came to say.

34:28.790 --> 34:31.724
I thought maybe next,
we hit the spa.

34:31.724 --> 34:33.761
Hey.

34:33.761 --> 34:35.556
We need to talk.

34:35.556 --> 34:38.179
That sounds serious.

34:38.179 --> 34:39.732
I know you wanna break up
with me.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.012
- How did you--
- It doesn't matter.

34:44.012 --> 34:49.639
What does matter
is that I know I screwed up.

34:49.639 --> 34:52.020
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.574
I--I'm not an idiot.

34:53.574 --> 34:57.095
I've just--
I've been acting like one.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.787
I thought I could pretend
that everything was perfect.

34:59.787 --> 35:01.892
Perfect vacation,
perfect proposal,

35:01.892 --> 35:04.067
perfect life, you know?

35:04.067 --> 35:06.552
No rocking the perfect boat.

35:06.552 --> 35:09.245
Is that why you never tell me
when something bothers you?

35:10.418 --> 35:13.732
The more time
I spent with you,

35:13.732 --> 35:15.872
the more I fell in love
with you.

35:15.872 --> 35:19.151
And I--I was terrified.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.636
Oh, Oliver.

35:29.989 --> 35:35.340
I've spent my whole life
believing that what I am,

35:35.340 --> 35:39.102
who I am is wrong.

35:39.102 --> 35:41.242
Because that's
what people told you.

35:41.242 --> 35:43.658
I know.
I'm not proud of it,

35:43.658 --> 35:47.421
but it's real.

35:47.421 --> 35:50.355
And I thought
that if we break up,

35:50.355 --> 35:52.598
if we fight,
if I can't keep us together,

35:52.598 --> 35:55.808
then it's like--
- Then those people are right,

35:55.808 --> 35:57.638
and you don't deserve love.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.472
That's a lot of pressure
to put on one relationship.

36:04.472 --> 36:06.267
And the--and the more
you paper over the issues,

36:06.267 --> 36:08.856
you know, the more--
the more artificial it is.

36:08.856 --> 36:10.133
No wonder you felt like
you were losing

36:10.133 --> 36:11.134
your connection with me.

36:11.134 --> 36:12.825
I was--I was lying.

36:12.825 --> 36:17.278
And the more I felt like
I was losing that connection,

36:17.278 --> 36:20.143
the more I buried myself
in my work.

36:23.526 --> 36:26.149
I'm sorry I did this to us.

36:26.149 --> 36:30.222
And I get--I get why
we need to end things.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.294
I have a lot of things
I need to sort out.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.228
And I think
you would be much happier

36:36.228 --> 36:38.989
with someone that's already
done their sorting.

36:45.548 --> 36:48.067
I really do want you
to be happy.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.347
I got my own room,

36:51.347 --> 36:53.176
so this one's all yours.

36:54.867 --> 36:57.145
I love you.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.393
I love you too.

37:07.363 --> 37:09.261
How's it going in here?

37:09.261 --> 37:10.711
It's going well.

37:10.711 --> 37:12.091
You here to take back
your office?

37:12.091 --> 37:14.715
Actually, no.
I'm here to say thank you.

37:14.715 --> 37:16.993
Everything you said was right.

37:16.993 --> 37:18.684
Everything I said?

37:18.684 --> 37:22.205
Yeah, about them

37:22.205 --> 37:25.450
and my soft, mushy center.

37:25.450 --> 37:27.106
Okay. Uh, you're welcome.

37:27.106 --> 37:29.385
But I still don't remember
us talking today.

37:29.385 --> 37:30.696
You wouldn't.

37:30.696 --> 37:32.560
But you helped me figure out
what I need to do.

37:34.769 --> 37:37.669
- You look sad.
- Hmm.

37:37.669 --> 37:40.085
Well, I am.

37:40.085 --> 37:42.294
Javier is faced
with an impossible choice.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.124
And I think maybe I'm the one
who needs to make it.

37:47.541 --> 37:49.715
Anyways, enjoy the office.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.752
This might be
your last day here.

38:16.259 --> 38:17.640
So that's what did it.

38:22.334 --> 38:25.268
Hey. Can we talk?

38:29.479 --> 38:30.446
You know,
you took me by surprise

38:30.446 --> 38:32.620
when you left yesterday.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.588
But yeah, for me, this trip

38:34.588 --> 38:38.695
was our last chance to see
if things could work.

38:38.695 --> 38:40.110
- I get that.
- You know, I--I tried

38:40.110 --> 38:43.182
to talk to you so many times,

38:43.182 --> 38:47.808
but you just kept pretending
like everything was fine.

38:47.808 --> 38:49.188
And I--and I didn't know
what was real

38:49.188 --> 38:51.467
or where I stood.

38:51.467 --> 38:54.849
I didn't know that you were
proving something to the world.

38:54.849 --> 38:57.024
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

38:57.024 --> 38:59.475
I grew up with it too.
I understand.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.549
Um, but when you did tell me,

39:04.549 --> 39:07.103
that was the closest
I had felt to you in months.

39:10.278 --> 39:13.799
Oliver Gold...

39:13.799 --> 39:16.215
you are generous,

39:16.215 --> 39:19.529
you are kind,

39:19.529 --> 39:22.049
you're funny,

39:22.049 --> 39:25.397
and you're supportive.

39:25.397 --> 39:28.158
And you deserve love.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.368
Thank you.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.541
Do you know that?

39:31.541 --> 39:34.717
Like, really know that?

39:34.717 --> 39:37.098
I'm trying to.

39:37.098 --> 39:39.377
Well, I guess I'm gonna have
to spend the rest of my life

39:39.377 --> 39:42.069
proving it to you.

39:42.069 --> 39:44.347
What's happening?
What are you doing?

39:44.347 --> 39:46.763
Oh, my God,
I am proposing to you,

39:46.763 --> 39:49.352
you ridiculous person!

39:49.352 --> 39:51.768
Oliver Gold,

39:51.768 --> 39:54.392
I have always loved you.

39:55.703 --> 39:57.947
I just didn't know
if you were still in there.

39:57.947 --> 40:02.710
I am so happy that you are.

40:02.710 --> 40:04.540
Well, you know, I'm--I'm
gonna have to think about it.

40:04.540 --> 40:06.196
Are you--are you serious?
I'm on my knees right now.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.716
- Yes, of course! Yes, yes.
- My God, ugh!

40:08.716 --> 40:12.202
<i>♪ Circles, I know you're
never gonna let go ♪</i>

40:12.202 --> 40:14.308
Yes!

40:14.308 --> 40:17.242
<i>♪ Don't let me down,
my heart's in your hands ♪</i>

40:20.279 --> 40:21.419
Hey.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.765
Why aren't we meeting
at the dock?

40:22.765 --> 40:26.907
- Hmm, long story, very long.
- Hmm.

40:26.907 --> 40:28.805
Do you mind if I tell you
a little later?

40:28.805 --> 40:31.325
Yeah, of course.

40:32.740 --> 40:35.294
I don't know what it is
about this place,

40:35.294 --> 40:37.089
'cause I've only been here
a couple of days,

40:37.089 --> 40:38.953
but I feel like it was weeks.

40:38.953 --> 40:41.266
It's island air.

40:41.266 --> 40:45.477
And, um, I remembered
that listening matters

40:45.477 --> 40:49.239
for my patients
and me too, I guess.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.310
For all of us.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.416
The work can drain the cup.

40:53.416 --> 40:57.834
Talking to someone,
taking care of my own needs,

40:57.834 --> 41:00.665
even just a little,
that can help refill it.

41:03.599 --> 41:05.463
And I feel strangely grateful
to you.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.741
Aww. Oh.

41:09.156 --> 41:11.607
Thank you. Ah.

41:29.521 --> 41:32.490
I'm never gonna look
at a mimosa the same way again.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.802
I'll never look at a mimosa
again, period.

41:34.802 --> 41:36.424
Well, I hope that's not true.

41:36.424 --> 41:37.702
Well, it's not.

41:37.702 --> 41:39.842
Come here.

41:39.842 --> 41:41.429
Mm.

41:41.429 --> 41:43.086
Congratulations.

41:43.086 --> 41:44.674
Thank you.

41:44.674 --> 41:46.849
I didn't know
you two got so close.

41:46.849 --> 41:48.885
You know,
some guests make a big impact

41:48.885 --> 41:50.784
in a very short time.

41:50.784 --> 41:52.648
There's a lot to this trip
you don't know.

41:53.994 --> 41:56.134
I'll tell him on the ride home.

41:56.134 --> 41:57.687
- Intriguing.
- Yeah.

41:57.687 --> 42:00.621
Well, uh, thank you
for a lovely stay.

42:00.621 --> 42:03.141
Yes, you're welcome.
And safe travels home.

42:03.141 --> 42:04.901
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Come on, babe.

42:04.901 --> 42:06.869
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.808
You can take
the rest of the day off.

42:14.808 --> 42:17.017
Um, I'm going to.

42:17.017 --> 42:19.467
Oh.

42:33.274 --> 42:35.311
You didn't show up
to Helene's birthday dinner.

42:35.311 --> 42:38.038
I--I did, a lot.

42:39.522 --> 42:41.213
Then I didn't.

42:41.213 --> 42:42.836
What does that mean?

42:42.836 --> 42:44.838
There is nothing
more important to me

42:44.838 --> 42:46.529
than your relationship
with Helene.

42:49.221 --> 42:50.671
I can't see you anymore.

42:53.191 --> 42:55.089
And I know
you don't understand, Javier.

42:55.089 --> 42:57.367
You're damn right, I don't.

42:57.367 --> 43:00.025
This is the only way to
reconcile the irreconcilable.

43:00.025 --> 43:02.614
I'm--please, please,
believe me when I tell you

43:02.614 --> 43:03.926
that this is for the best, Javier.

43:03.926 --> 43:05.617
Elena...

43:05.617 --> 43:06.687
I'm sorry.
