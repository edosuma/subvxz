WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:04.471
Previously onSEAL Team...Senior Chief Ashland Spenser.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.988
You know, if I was so terrible,
why is my only son

00:07.050 --> 00:09.302
spending his life following
in my footsteps?

00:09.350 --> 00:11.136
I'm not following
in your footsteps.

00:11.180 --> 00:12.397
I'm erasing them.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.828
You deserve someone

00:13.880 --> 00:15.393
that will embrace
your life.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.054
I don't think that I can
be with you anymore.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.135
RAY:
Padre,

00:18.190 --> 00:19.612
give him his last rites.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.921
I can't.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.141
He's dead.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.146
JASON:
Adam was killed in action.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.327
Gave his life
to save his brothers.

00:28.370 --> 00:29.803
SONNY: Last time we were here,
when we, uh...

00:29.850 --> 00:32.193
DAVIS:
That was a fleeting moment.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.800
SONNY: Fleeting...

00:36.210 --> 00:37.416
Sonny.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.074
Yeah.

00:50.390 --> 00:52.824
Not often you find

00:52.870 --> 00:55.657
Jeff Walker outside the Beltway.
What's the occasion?

00:55.700 --> 00:58.134
Wanted to make sure we're
on the same page before you push

00:58.180 --> 00:59.442
this mission to
the assault force.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.219
God, I don't like
the sound of that.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.888
Farid Dahir, sex trafficker with
ties to Turkish organized crime,

01:04.930 --> 01:07.103
pops up on the grid
every once in a while.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.664
Has a nice_|ittle business _for
himself selling women onllne.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.711
And?
And this.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.672
My name is Jenna Robertson.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.632
I'm from the United States
of America.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.285
I'm 22 years old.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.558
I left my country
by my own choice.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.160
I weigh 52 kilograms...

01:25.210 --> 01:29.169
Jihad Jenna. All-American
Midwestern teenager,

01:29.210 --> 01:31.212
radicalized online, disappears
from home two years ago,

01:31.260 --> 01:34.218
shows up in Syria
an ISIS mujahideen bride.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.649
_ And became an instant
fixture In their propaganda.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.918
That's her.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.394
Fighter she married, Abu Rakim.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.318
He's one of six battlefield
commanders still operational.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.319
So how'd she end up for sale
by a Turkish trafficker?

01:48.360 --> 01:52.103
Unknown. What we do know
is an account linked to Dahir

01:52.150 --> 01:54.277
posted a sizable incoming
wire transfer yesterday.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.286
Dahir found a buyer.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.764
Who?Probably her husband.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.289
If she escaped,
ISIL can't have Jenna

02:00.330 --> 02:02.025
ending up in Western hands.

02:02.070 --> 02:03.765
The intel she has
is bad enough,

02:03.810 --> 02:05.550
but it's the PR angle
that'll really hurt:

02:05.600 --> 02:07.636
"Jihad Jenna disavows
the caliphate."

02:07.690 --> 02:11.160
The handoff is set to
go down in 24 hours.

02:11.210 --> 02:14.771
You are not seriously
considering a rescue op.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.252
Not considering it.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.380
Mission's already
been authorized.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.476
Jenna spent the past two years
in the highest levels

02:20.530 --> 02:22.998
of an unrecognized
enemy nation state.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.302
She's a treasure trove of intel.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.318
So is her husband Rakim.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.146
Why not just go after him?

02:30.190 --> 02:32.010
I mean, Jenna's a woman.
In that world,

02:32.060 --> 02:33.789
there's no way she would have

02:33.840 --> 02:38.800
access to the kind of
intel you're after.

02:38.850 --> 02:42.104
This smells like politics.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.287
We're rescuing a young woman
who made a terrible mistake

02:44.330 --> 02:45.638
and needs the help
of her country.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.729
Oh, my...Whatever intel

02:48.770 --> 02:51.819
or optics come along with that
will be well-received.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.418
You don't believe that.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.030
I don't need to.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.253
And neither do you.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.086
Just prep your team.

03:00.130 --> 03:02.439
In the end, it's
a kinetic op,

03:02.480 --> 03:04.471
just like any other.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.635
Okay...

03:38.210 --> 03:41.168
Yeah. Yeah, hang on.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.313
Ash?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.011
Clay.

03:59.060 --> 04:03.269
So what happened to, uh, Stella?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.457
What do you mean? Who
says anything happened?

04:05.500 --> 04:07.286
Well, I don't know,
just, the general lack

04:07.330 --> 04:09.366
of anything female
in this place.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.469
We split up.

04:13.510 --> 04:15.239
Oh.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.815
That's too bad.
I liked her.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.294
I suppose it's better
it happened now,

04:20.340 --> 04:22.388
before some nasty divorce, or...

04:22.430 --> 04:24.125
Kids to cramp my style.

04:24.170 --> 04:26.252
That's not what I meant.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.729
So what are you doing here?

04:30.790 --> 04:33.008
Just wanted to see you.

04:33.050 --> 04:37.316
Well, there's a first
for everything, I guess, right?

04:37.360 --> 04:41.000
Clay. Hey.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.789
You're my son.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.922
I'm proud of you.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.540
I keep tabs on everything
you do. All right?

04:47.590 --> 04:50.627
Don't think I don't know
that it was you, okay.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.409
It was Brave Team who handled
that mess over at Saudi

04:52.460 --> 04:53.768
a couple months ago.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.935
Maybe.

04:57.990 --> 05:01.460
Maybe. BS.

05:03.780 --> 05:07.125
Listen, I got a meeting
with my publisher in an hour.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.035
I was hoping
we could get a beer later.

05:09.090 --> 05:11.433
Okay? I need to run
something by you.Get a beer later?

05:11.480 --> 05:15.086
Yeah, let's, let's get a beer
later, Dad. That'd be good.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.689
You know? Maybe we can toss
the old pigskin around?

05:18.750 --> 05:21.389
It'd be fun.
It'd be really fun.You're my son, okay?

05:21.450 --> 05:24.408
Now, I know that I wasn't
the world's greatest dad,

05:24.450 --> 05:26.884
but I'd like us to be closer.

05:26.930 --> 05:29.444
Yeah, well, you know, it doesn't
really happen that way...

05:29.500 --> 05:31.456
Yeah, I realize that, Clay!

05:31.500 --> 05:33.889
But I'm just looking
for a chance to work it out.

06:01.490 --> 06:04.311
EMMA: "An oasis
in the midst of rolling hills,

06:04.360 --> 06:05.349
"Bennington is a refuge

06:05.400 --> 06:07.743
from the rigors
of modern life."

06:07.800 --> 06:09.097
HANNAH:
Okay.

06:09.150 --> 06:10.447
That a college or a day spa?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.888
EMMA:
Shut up.

06:11.930 --> 06:14.103
Maybe it's a cult?

06:14.150 --> 06:16.015
How do you know
what a cult is?

06:16.070 --> 06:17.492
The Internet.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.546
It is, um, "bastion for the next
generation of trailblazers."

06:23.600 --> 06:25.852
HANNAH: Trailblazer?
Yeah, not-not sure that's me.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.118
Eh, Adam Seaver's kid

06:28.170 --> 06:31.298
is gonna be whatever
she wants to be, Hannah.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.773
Thanks, Mr. Hayes.You got it.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.902
HANNAH:
Oh. Hi, Mom.

06:34.950 --> 06:36.212
Hey, let me grab my bag, okay?

06:36.260 --> 06:37.431
JASON: _
Hey, Victoria.
Hey.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.993
Did they study at all?

06:39.050 --> 06:42.042
Um... I have no idea.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.910
But, you know what?
They were laughing, so...

06:43.960 --> 06:45.655
Hmm....that's all
that matters, right?

06:45.700 --> 06:47.008
They're luclq
to have each other.

06:47.050 --> 06:48.779
Yeah.Can you believe

06:48.840 --> 06:50.796
they're both gonna
leave home soon?

06:50.840 --> 06:54.401
Yeah, out in
the real world, uh...

06:56.450 --> 06:58.589
You don't think
Emma's ready for it?

07:02.500 --> 07:04.456
You know,
I was meaning to call you.

07:04.510 --> 07:08.116
Um, I've been going
to a support group.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.378
Maybe you should
come to one.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.113
A support group.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.161
Yeah.No, that's, uh...

07:14.210 --> 07:15.643
really not my thing.

07:15.690 --> 07:18.215
I figured.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.694
But it might surprise you.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.208
Why is that?Well, if anything else,

07:23.260 --> 07:24.693
it's right next
to a diner,

07:24.740 --> 07:28.039
so, um, I get to grief eat.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.615
They got beer there?They do.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.480
Beer, I like.
You know?

07:32.530 --> 07:34.486
The whole grief counseling
thing, I'm not, uh,

07:34.540 --> 07:36.440
it's not really me.Yeah.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.492
I'm more of a, uh,

07:38.540 --> 07:40.849
a grin and I'll have another
beer kind of a guy.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.494
Right?

07:42.540 --> 07:44.098
Yeah.Yeah.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.845
Okay.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.322
You take care, Jason.Yeah.

07:47.370 --> 07:49.065
Yeah, see you.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.020
VICTORIA: Did you get
any work done, ladies?

07:51.070 --> 07:52.947
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.684
Pastor, I know.
We've just been real busy.

07:58.730 --> 08:03.383
No, Naima didn't tell me.
It must've slipped her mind.

08:03.430 --> 08:06.604
Yeah, y
Um, can I get back to you?

08:06.660 --> 08:08.605
Okay.

08:08.660 --> 08:11.174
All right. You, too.

08:13.180 --> 08:16.138
Hello from under the bus.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.014
It's Pastor Mel, like...

08:20.060 --> 08:21.277
asking about dates
for the baptism.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.969
I didn't have an answer.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.715
How about an answer for me?

08:24.760 --> 08:28.196
I mean, you've been
ducking it for a while.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.844
What's on your mind?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.379
I haven't been ducking
a damn thing, Naima.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.320
W-What am I supposed to do,
just walk around

08:33.380 --> 08:35.200
telling you
what's on my mind every minute?

08:35.250 --> 08:38.208
Huh?Not asking you to do that.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.239
Just asking about the baptism.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.158
Baby, I-I, look, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.256
Okay?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.084
I just don't
know what...

08:50.130 --> 08:51.654
I don't know what to tell
the church right now.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.134
I'm not ready
to tell them anything.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.522
Hey, there's no rush
for the baptism.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.571
I'll even take
the blame.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.628
You all right?

09:08.670 --> 09:10.672
Yeah. Fine.

09:29.390 --> 09:31.381
There you are.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.608
Ooh...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.311
Oh, you're awake!Oh! Damn, Davis.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.318
Man, you scared
the hell out of me.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.669
Oh, I'm sorry.Ugh, made a mess here.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.405
Breakfast time.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.404
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.542
All right. What we having?

09:54.590 --> 09:56.490
Oh, I don't know.
What are you making?

09:56.550 --> 10:00.111
Okay, you got to
let my processors wake up

10:00.160 --> 10:04.335
before I can construct a
meal for such fine company.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.816
Well, okay, well, start on
processing 'cause I'm hungry.

10:07.860 --> 10:12.217
You gonna remember to take
your hat home this time?

10:12.260 --> 10:14.512
Do you know
that it's bad luck

10:14.570 --> 10:16.731
to separate a Texan from
his hat before noon?

10:16.790 --> 10:18.348
It's bad luckUh-huh.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.129
Well, the last guy
it happened to,

10:20.180 --> 10:22.000
his horse got shingles. Yep.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.701
And that's actually a real
thing. I didn't know that.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.526
Okay, and what happened
to the last girl?

10:27.580 --> 10:30.185
Well,

10:30.230 --> 10:32.448
a woman's never worn it before.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.061
What are you staring at?

10:41.850 --> 10:45.638
I'm just enjoying this moment.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.595
Yeah, well...

10:48.640 --> 10:51.427
Mm. Yeah.

10:51.470 --> 10:54.257
Mm-hmm.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.426
I'm gonna take a shower.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.607
Okay.
Okay.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.299
Hey, Davis.

11:05.310 --> 11:08.746
My hat does not go
in the shower.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.532
Yeah.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.050
Whew. All right,
who wants, uh...

11:15.100 --> 11:17.978
sunny

11:18.020 --> 11:22.366
Hey, Davis, where you keep the,
uh, cooking utensils

11:22.420 --> 11:25.412
and hot sauce and stuff?

11:37.560 --> 11:40.905
We will bathe in the blood
of your soldiers.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.384
Praise be...

11:44.440 --> 11:47.216
SONNY: So, let me get
this straight. Okay?

11:47.270 --> 11:49.784
We're being asked to rescue
some addled teenager

11:49.830 --> 11:53.527
whose ideal spa treatment is
to soak in American blood.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.263
That's the mission, Sonny.
You don't have to like it.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.094
Well, just for the
record, I don't.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.495
As far as I'm concerned,
she can rot in hell.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.976
MANDY: Politically,
Jenna's choice to join ISIS

12:04.020 --> 12:05.237
is being viewed as
a childhood mistake.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.669
_ And her role in
their propaganda as coerced.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.971
A childhood mistake?

12:09.030 --> 12:10.327
She was 19 when
she married Rakim.

12:10.380 --> 12:13.019
Perfect age for
online radicalization.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.502
Her story fits the profile

12:14.550 --> 12:15.892
of dozens of women.

12:15.950 --> 12:17.679
You're patronizing her
because she's a woman.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.459
You'd_ never offer that excuse
if she were a man.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.385
I might be rationalizing it
for myself, sure.

12:21.430 --> 12:25.434
I was 19 when I enlisted.
I knew what I was doing.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.993
She did, too.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.608
Maybe who she was
isn't who she is.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.729
SONNY:
Oh, surprise, surprise.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.872
Gandhi over here thinks that

12:31.920 --> 12:34.309
Miss Death-To-America
has seen the light.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.316
RAY: There's dozens of Americans
held captive around the world.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.657
We're not going after them.

12:37.710 --> 12:38.790
But s_alvation comes
in the form

12:38.840 --> 12:40.273
of Bravo Team
kicking down the door

12:40.320 --> 12:42.015
of a woman who
betrayed us all

12:42.060 --> 12:43.880
Why? 'Cause Jenna Robertson's
name is on the list. Right?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.886
If the intel supports it,
then it supports it.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.841
Right? Debate club's over.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.711
MANDY: This operation walks
the line between politics

12:50.770 --> 12:52.283
and our military strategy
in the region.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.321
Whether or not she has
actionable intel,

12:54.380 --> 12:56.336
whether or not she's
gle of treason,

12:56.380 --> 13:00.635
the important thing is that
the papers read...

13:00.690 --> 13:02.726
"Jihad Jenna Disavows ISIS."

13:02.780 --> 13:05.476
And that can't happen
unless we bring her home.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.178
ERIC:
All right, you heard her.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.175
Grab your kits.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.268
Wheels up in four hours.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.834
Dahir's holding Jenna
in Al-Hasakah,

13:24.890 --> 13:27.188
200 kilometers
inside Syria.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.232
Al
This place is a dump, man.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.929
It's been bombed
to hell and back.

13:31.980 --> 13:34.062
Oh, yeah, everyone from ISIS
to the Kurds

13:34.110 --> 13:35.759
have occupied it at one time
or another.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.118
Nothing left
but scorched earth.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.764
It's Russian-controlled
airspace, right?
Right.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.028
Exactly why we're gonna
HAHO in to the D2,

13:41.080 --> 13:42.115
five klicks east of the target.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.593
RAY:
Not much of an offset.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.119
I mean, they could
easily have patrols

13:45.170 --> 13:46.649
inside of five klicks.

13:46.690 --> 13:47.998
What's the closest QRF, Davis?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.769
A Marine Corps infantry unit,

13:49.820 --> 13:51.640
70 kilometers north,
in Qamishli.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.383
They have rotary wing assets

13:53.440 --> 13:55.123
that will double
as your extraction platform.

13:55.180 --> 13:58.172
SONNY: Russian airspace,
so no ISR.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.041
Not exactly.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.965
This is the future.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.355
This is a next-generation
prototype of the Raven UAV.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.445
Brock, don't touch that.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.094
It's got an extended
battery bank

14:09.150 --> 14:10.879
and streaming capabilities.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.181
I think I found one of those

14:12.240 --> 14:14.060
at the bottom of
a Cracker Jack box once.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.146
It may not look like much,
but it is gonna give us eyes.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.668
So, once you're on the ground,
launch it when you land.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.278
Then I will take control
via satellite

14:20.330 --> 14:23.982
and provide ISR for your infil
and action on target.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.463
All you boys got to do
is get it up.

14:25.510 --> 14:26.727
You think you can do that?

14:26.770 --> 14:28.294
Oh...
Oh, zing.

14:28.340 --> 14:30.205
That's why they
call me Full Metal.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.818
Zing!

14:31.870 --> 14:33.383
All right, all right,
all right.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.603
Let's lock it up.

14:35.650 --> 14:37.083
JASON :
What's the target structure?

14:37.130 --> 14:38.381
It's a local mausoleum.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.044
It's a large building
for such a small force,

14:40.090 --> 14:42.172
but we can't afford to leave
a bigger footprint on this one.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.222
What do you have
on the actual target?

14:44.270 --> 14:46.318
Last satellite pass
indicates four to six

14:46.360 --> 14:48.180
fighting-age males moving
off and on the target

14:48.230 --> 14:52.098
throughout the day with
different bags and vehicles.

14:52.150 --> 14:53.924
No sign of Miss Robertson.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.924
Armed?

14:54.980 --> 14:56.015
Appear to be.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.585
Remember, this is
a contested area

14:58.630 --> 15:02.896
inside a full-blown war zone
With zero governing authority.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.498
Don't assume anything out there.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.279
Middle of no

15:06.340 --> 15:08.205
Limited assets,
intel and overwatch?

15:08.250 --> 15:10.206
I-I got to say it feels off.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.077
Maybe she's looking for a repeat
of the Echo Team ambush.

15:15.130 --> 15:18.475
And this place,
this is the perfect spot for it.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.249
All right, look,
it's a long flight,

15:20.310 --> 15:22.380
so what should we do, Blackburn?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.260
Let's get some rest.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.314
If it was my choice,
we wouldn't be

15:30.360 --> 15:31.657
prosecuting this operation
at all.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.223
Well, if it was my choice,
I'd rather be...

15:33.280 --> 15:35.145
be ice-skating
with the boys,

15:35.190 --> 15:37.181
and afterwards,
throwing down some 'Ronas.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.663
I don't like it.What don't you like?

15:39.720 --> 15:42.143
Politically motivated
missions never end well

15:42.200 --> 15:45.237
because they generally begin
with incomplete intel packages.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.895
Ray's right.

15:47.940 --> 15:50.283
There's nothing to indicate
that Jenna isn't a hostage,

15:50.340 --> 15:54.299
but nothing indicates that
she's not still loyal to ISIS.

15:54.340 --> 15:56.729
Mandy, we're about to jump
out of this plane very soon,

15:56.780 --> 15:59.169
so unless you have something
concrete to scrub this mission,

15:59.210 --> 16:01.553
it's business as usual.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.214
Infil. Hit the target,
mission complete.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.990
Exfil. Easy day.

16:06.050 --> 16:09.304
Okay, I'm just saying
the intel is incomplete.

16:09.350 --> 16:11.261
Be careful.

16:11.310 --> 16:13.175
All right.One hour out.

16:13.230 --> 16:14.788
It's about time to get
jocked up.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.398
Time to get jocked up.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.333
JASON :
Havoc, this is 1. Pass Travis.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.075
That's a good copy, Bravo 1.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.257
I copy Travis. Havoc out.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.132
Havoc, this is 1.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.000
We got a clean visual
on the target building.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.563
Good copy, Bravo 1.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.349
You are clear to
launch the UAV.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.273
TRENT:
Havoc, this is Bravo 4.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.049
UAV is up in the air.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.793
You're cleared hot
to take over control.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.273
Copy, Bravo 4. Stand by.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.289
I have control of the drone.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.642
JASON: Havoc, this is 1.
I need an updated sitrep

18:06.690 --> 18:07.907
on the target building.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.479
Target is clean right now,
Bravo 1.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.988
Copy that. Let's move.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.404
ERIC:
Bravo 1, we are picking up

18:28.450 --> 18:30.532
a single heat signature
in the second floor

18:30.580 --> 18:32.104
of the target building.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.497
JASON:
Copy that.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.506
JASON:
This is it.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.121
Do it.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.475
Go. Move.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.534
Move.
Movmg.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.284
No sign of vest or belt.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.594
We're Americans.
Identify yourself.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.727
Jackpot.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.463
Havoc, it's 1. Pass Crockett.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.589
Cut her loose.

20:24.350 --> 20:26.693
Ray, take the gag out.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.048
Hey, shut her up!

20:28.090 --> 20:29.307
Hold her down!
Shut up!

20:29.350 --> 20:31.306
Don't let her move.What do you got?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.395
She's wired.

20:42.410 --> 20:44.059
SUMMER:
Don't move her.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.328
JASON:
Talk to me, Kairos.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.679
Kairos, talk to me.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.585
She moves, we die.

21:02.430 --> 21:03.419
JASON:
Kairos, why didn't it detonate?

21:03.470 --> 21:05.028
SUMMER:
No idea.

21:05.080 --> 21:09.471
I got three 152-mil shells
wired together.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.307
Kill radius is this room
and half the building.

21:12.350 --> 21:14.398
Well, if that line's
the trigger,

21:14.440 --> 21:16.351
let's cut it and get
the hell out of Dodge.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.833
SUMMER:
Not that simple.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.393
Current could be running
through this wire.

21:19.450 --> 21:21.224
You cut the circuit,
it detonates.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.499
How long to disarm it?I can't say.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.792
This arduino and power source
are linked

21:26.850 --> 21:29.318
to a blasting cap in the nose
of each artillery round.

21:29.370 --> 21:32.624
If she moves,
breaks the circuit, boom.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.454
JASON: All stations,
this is 1.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.932
We got an EOD situation.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.504
Hostage is hooked up
to multiple UXOs.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.415
We cannot move her
without detonation.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.688
Target's not secure.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.379
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.079
I copy your
EOD situation.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.906
Be advised, you don't have
much time till daylight.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.212
Copy that.

21:50.260 --> 21:53.559
ERIC: Fill us in as it
progresses. Havoc out.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.523
Thanks a pantload there, Lassie,

22:00.580 --> 22:02.741
but we already fell
in the damn well.

22:02.790 --> 22:04.405
What can we do?

22:04.450 --> 22:06.406
EOD's on it.
Don't worry about it.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.758
You two, pull security
on the north side.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.665
Check. We're on it.

22:12.540 --> 22:16.192
How the hell didn't
the Agency catch this?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.504
You know we can't predict what
happens once they're on target.

22:18.550 --> 22:20.370
Yeah, well, you can
vet it well enough

22:20.420 --> 22:21.637
to keep my men
from walking

22:21.680 --> 22:23.375
straight into an ambush.
Sun's coming up.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.637
Time on target's

22:24.690 --> 22:26.635
gonna be way too long.
Davis, spin up the QRF.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.511
Mone_ro.
On it.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.165
Had to be spotters watching us
come in, gonna be wondering

22:32.220 --> 22:34.438
why that bomb did not detonate.I know.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.436
Only a matter of time
before they show up.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.038
We're fish in a barrel
down here.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.399
I know. Bravo 6,
this is 1.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.396
I need you to run
external security.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.443
Check. External security.
We're on it.

22:52.580 --> 22:56.061
Take the gag out of her mouth.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.668
Don't move.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.369
JASON:
Listen to me,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.194
Abu Rakim, where is he?

23:01.240 --> 23:02.798
I-I-I don't know.
I don't know.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.636
Yes, you do.
You're a part of this.No, no, no.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.501
No, I'm not. I'm-- No.
Rakim's a monster.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.073
I ran from him.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.428
Yeah, after running
right to him.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.074
No, I'm-I'm not a part of this.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.735
Yes, you are. You're
the reason why we're here.

23:13.780 --> 23:16.556
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

23:16.610 --> 23:17.907
I-I didn't know
there was a bomb.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.473
I didn't know there was a bomb.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.909
I'm not part of this.
You have to believe me.JASON: Stop.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.133
We're not here to believe you.
We're here to take you home.

23:29.580 --> 23:31.571
Bravo 4, I got one fighter
moving from the south

23:31.620 --> 23:33.349
to our southeast
coming toward us.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.219
Check.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.056
I see him. He's armed.

23:47.290 --> 23:49.804
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 4.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.203
One fighter down on the
east side of the target.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.899
Bravo 6 to Havoc Base.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.259
Requesting an updated
ISR sitrep on the area

23:56.300 --> 23:57.688
due east of the target building.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.129
DAVIS: Copy, Bravo 6.
Coming around

24:00.170 --> 24:01.478
for a wider pass.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.870
You don't have to hold me down.
I won't move.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.706
Like you didn't move
when we came in?

24:10.750 --> 24:13.184
Yeah, you seemed pretty
eager to move then.

24:13.230 --> 24:15.266
I was scared.Uh-huh.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.402
I didn't know who you were.Yeah.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.361
I didn't know that
they rigged this.

24:19.410 --> 24:22.755
When your pals come in here and
put a bullet right through you,

24:22.800 --> 24:26.361
you ain't gonna get the whole
martyr afterlife package.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.194
What do lady bombers
get anyway?

24:28.240 --> 24:29.935
Always wondered that.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.150
Sonny. Disengage.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.202
I was just about to
do that anyway.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.242
She's not going anywhere.
Pull security at the doorway.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.289
Roger that.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.331
Kairos, talk to me.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.029
What's going on?Working the problem.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.217
ERIC:
Bravo 6,

24:43.260 --> 24:45.342
we are registering
two heat signatures

24:45.390 --> 24:47.654
northeast of your position,
200 meters out.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.748
Havoc Base, I got nothing.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.303
They're one
block out, 6.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.782
Closing in from
the northeast.

24:56.840 --> 25:00.708
See them as soon as
they cross the MSR.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.830
TRENT:
Havoc, this is Bravo 4.

25:02.890 --> 25:04.312
Nothing from my angle.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.883
4, I'm gonna move
to the northeast corner

25:05.930 --> 25:07.147
to get a better look.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.065
Check. I'll hold here.

25:15.070 --> 25:17.630
What is that?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.464
That's a radio.

25:19.510 --> 25:22.388
He's a spotter.They're calling the cavalry in.

25:24.430 --> 25:28.082
Havoc Base to Bravo 1,
we're seeing an enemy technical

25:28.130 --> 25:30.303
with a heavy machine gun
and at least

25:30.350 --> 25:32.250
six armed fighters
two mikes out,

25:32.310 --> 25:34.915
approaching your location
from the east.

25:34.960 --> 25:39.397
Good copy, Havoc. IED initiated
ambush with follow-up assault.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.656
These guys know
what they're doing.

25:40.710 --> 25:43.270
Bravo 6, you're gonna
see 'em first.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.311
Good copy, Bravo 1. I'm on it.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.454
I'll take "Jihadi Honey Traps"
for 800, Alex.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.149
Kairos, talk to me.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.508
Five, ten minutes maybe.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.375
Bravo 6 to Bravo 4,
I got a vehicle

26:04.430 --> 26:06.648
moving toward us right here.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.477
TRENT: It's an up-armored VBIED.
Smoke it!

26:30.060 --> 26:32.528
Trent, I can't get
a bullet in there.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.994
After all these years, finally.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.213
Yeah, buddy.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.655
Uh, rocket out.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.270
JASON: What the hell
just happened, Bravo 6?

27:09.320 --> 27:10.662
CLAY:
Enemy just detonated a VBIED

27:10.710 --> 27:12.701
about 30 meters_
from our egress pomt.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.102
TRENT:
1, this is 4.

27:14.150 --> 27:17.062
Correction. I
just detonated an enemy VBIED

27:17.110 --> 27:19.271
30 meters from
our egress p0int.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.367
Okay. Check. Hold security,
and, uh, we're almost done here.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.717
Negative. I can't see anything

27:23.770 --> 27:25.419
up here with all this smoke.All right. Check.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.540
Get back to the first deck.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.726
I'll meet you
at the main entrance.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.635
Okay, swami boy, let's go.
Storm's coming.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.419
Working the problem.

27:31.470 --> 27:34.735
Work faster, hippie.
Work it like a vegan burrito.

27:34.780 --> 27:38.819
Kairos?Five minutes, at most.

27:38.870 --> 27:41.475
We're good here, J. Go.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.693
The minute it's safe to go,
get her out fast,

27:43.740 --> 27:46.265
meet us at the main entrance.
You got it?Affirmative.

27:46.310 --> 27:48.392
Sonny, hold the room.

27:50.580 --> 27:52.309
Brock, Full Metal,
collapse your position,

27:52.360 --> 27:54.351
meet me at the front entrance.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.425
Bravo 1, be advised,

28:22.480 --> 28:24.300
you have approximately
ten enemy combatants

28:24.350 --> 28:26.079
converging on
your position.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.178
Understood.

28:28.220 --> 28:31.519
Bravo 1, you need to move
and move fast. QRF is inbound.

28:31.570 --> 28:33.618
You need to get your guys
out of there.

28:47.550 --> 28:49.711
Hey, hey.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.728
Hey, you're gonna
get out of here, okay?

28:52.770 --> 28:55.079
You're gonna
get out of here.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.759
I don't deserve to.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.209
I don't deserve
to get out of here.

29:00.260 --> 29:04.299
Well, I do. Hmm?

29:04.350 --> 29:07.990
You have to stay calm, okay?

29:08.050 --> 29:09.381
Shh...

29:09.440 --> 29:12.398
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
for everything that I did.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.611
I'm so sorry.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.618
I didn't know about this,
I swear, I swear.

29:16.660 --> 29:19.481
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.I didn't know.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.269
I believe you.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.753
Okay?

29:24.500 --> 29:28.618
You do?
I do.

29:28.670 --> 29:30.228
Why?

29:30.290 --> 29:33.020
A feeling.

29:33.070 --> 29:35.538
That's all?

29:35.590 --> 29:37.330
That's it.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.683
Shh... Look at me.

29:41.730 --> 29:45.257
Just meet your eyes
with mine and breathe.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.551
You're gonna be okay.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.404
1, this is 4.
It's getting too hot up here.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.105
I'm collapsing security
to your position.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.116
Good copy, Bravo 4.
Meet you at main entrance.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.072
Move it.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.247
Move! Spenser, you good?

30:24.300 --> 30:26.598
Yeah, yeah, I'm solid. Got
contacted on my way down here.

30:26.650 --> 30:27.947
They're coming through
the south entrance,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.513
must've been when we were
shooting that VBIED.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.289
Yeah, they're
coming through like rats.

30:31.350 --> 30:33.386
JASON: All right, look, we'll
stronghold our position here

30:33.440 --> 30:35.123
until Kairos finishes
nerfing those bombs,

30:35.180 --> 30:36.909
and then we'll go home.

30:38.610 --> 30:41.568
Bravo 1, how far out
from exfil are you?

30:41.620 --> 30:42.962
We're close. QRF?

30:43.010 --> 30:44.875
ERIC: They're moving
as fast as they can.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.739
Right now we're looking
at five mikes out.

30:49.020 --> 30:51.443
Jenna, I get up, you're
gonna stay still, right?

31:05.680 --> 31:06.897
You're praying, aren't you?

31:08.990 --> 31:11.254
No.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.609
No, I haven't prayed in a while.

31:15.610 --> 31:17.862
Will you pray for me?

31:30.450 --> 31:31.929
The Lord is my shepherd.

31:31.970 --> 31:36.669
I shall not want. He maketh me
lie down in green pastures.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.678
He leadeth me
beside still waters.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.711
If we're planning to shoot
our way out of here,

31:41.760 --> 31:43.762
we're gonna need some more guns
online, you know that.

31:43.810 --> 31:47.337
Kairos, how long? I need
all my shooters down here.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.859
Kairos, how long?

31:48.900 --> 31:50.982
Patience is a virtue.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.032
Not a Texan one.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.638
SUMMER:
Moment of truth.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.564
That's it?

32:08.620 --> 32:10.747
That's it.Damn it, Hurt Locker,

32:10.790 --> 32:12.189
I could've flipped
that switch myself.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.185
You kidding me?

32:13.230 --> 32:15.312
Yup, cut her loose.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.622
All right, boys.
Let's move.

32:16.670 --> 32:18.706
Come on.

32:35.770 --> 32:37.328
You good to go?

32:37.390 --> 32:38.721
Never more
than right now.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.654
JASON:
Get down!

32:51.700 --> 32:52.837
SUMMER:
An RPG-7

32:52.880 --> 32:54.222
won't arm under 100 meters.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.090
You can all breathe again.
Let's go!

32:57.540 --> 32:59.405
Grenade!

33:15.160 --> 33:16.639
Trent, tourniquet.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.555
Okay. Hey, hey.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.033
_Calm down.
Listen, Jenna.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.729
Looks like it didn't hit
an artery, okay?

33:21.780 --> 33:23.998
You're gonna be fine.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.996
It did hit your leg,
but it didn't go through.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.770
Now you're gonna feel
some pressure.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.957
Hold on.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.604
Bravo 1, be advised.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.616
You have two enemy
technical vehicles

33:34.660 --> 33:37.743
outside the
target building.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.506
We got to take out that Dishka!

33:56.550 --> 33:58.199
We got to wait
for them to reload!

34:04.730 --> 34:06.334
Ray, stay with the hostage.

34:06.390 --> 34:07.687
Copy.

34:07.740 --> 34:10.698
Sonny, give us a good burst
on our way out.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.740
Go!

34:27.930 --> 34:30.012
Hey. Prep a frag.

34:36.850 --> 34:38.158
On your mark.

34:41.990 --> 34:44.026
Move, move!

34:44.080 --> 34:45.809
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90!

34:49.080 --> 34:50.809
Let's clean this out.Let's do it.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.873
Cease fire! Cease fire!

35:10.230 --> 35:12.050
Let's get out of here.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.145
ERIC:
Bravo 1.

35:13.190 --> 35:15.101
QRF and exfil
platform are inbound.

35:15.150 --> 35:16.845
What is the status
on the hostage?

35:16.890 --> 35:18.448
Havoc, stand by one.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.196
Bravo 2,
what's your sitrep?

35:21.240 --> 35:23.674
Bravo 2, what's your sitrep?

35:24.680 --> 35:26.022
She's gonna be fine.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.026
Target's secure. Get us home.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.297
ERIC:
Copy that.

35:30.340 --> 35:31.466
JASON: Let's go.
Let's go!

35:31.520 --> 35:33.078
Cheers to that.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.269
Hey.

35:51.320 --> 35:52.617
Hmm?

35:52.670 --> 35:54.149
What's that?

35:54.190 --> 35:55.441
The reason we're alive.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.531
Thought the circuit board
was part of the bomb.

35:59.590 --> 36:00.932
It was.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.288
This a second arduino.

36:02.330 --> 36:03.672
A fail-safe.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.800
A trap on a trap.

36:04.850 --> 36:06.715
But it's faulty.
Look.

36:06.770 --> 36:10.149
One tiny wire.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.596
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.121
By any definition,
a miracle, man.

36:17.170 --> 36:19.809
Maybe.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.644
Or maybe whoever built it
got sloppy.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.509
Oh, come on now.Yeah, maybe...

36:23.570 --> 36:25.561
maybe it got broke
on instillation.

36:25.610 --> 36:28.522
Maybe...
maybe it's just dumb luck.

36:30.010 --> 36:31.830
Not everything is more
than it seems, Kairos.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.440
Hey, but hey.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.310
Either way...

36:36.360 --> 36:38.180
thanks.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.538
Yeah.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.844
Walking my team
into a setup

36:41.890 --> 36:44.324
with a half-baked
intel package

36:44.370 --> 36:46.804
just so you could put
a notch on your belt?

36:46.850 --> 36:48.932
I don't give a damn
about seniority, Jeff.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.584
Someone is gonna
answer for this.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.154
Okay, well, I hope
whoever that was deserved it.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.818
More than deserved.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.248
Jason, I'm sorry.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.518
CIA, we...

37:00.560 --> 37:02.642
Wemissed something on this.

37:02.690 --> 37:03.907
Well, the intel
wasn't totally wrong.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.302
I mean, Jenna was there, so...

37:05.350 --> 37:07.124
Yeah, sitting on a bomb.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.659
Well, you can never really know

37:08.700 --> 37:10.349
what's around every corner,
now, can you?

37:10.400 --> 37:13.096
Well, look,
I'm-I'm sorry.

37:14.970 --> 37:16.358
This isn't like you.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.311
I know that you
were shaky...

37:18.360 --> 37:20.089
before this whole
mission started and all,

37:20.150 --> 37:22.618
but look-- got the
job done, right?

37:22.670 --> 37:24.444
Everybody's alive.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.580
It was a good day.

37:25.630 --> 37:28.497
Easy day.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.852
So I hear
they serve beer here.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.902
Jason. Hey. Yeah.

37:43.950 --> 37:46.384
You missed the meeting.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.738
Oh, thank God.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.862
Last thing I want to do
is sit there and...

37:49.910 --> 37:51.389
Thank you.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.477
Can I get a beer?
Well, unless you

37:54.530 --> 37:55.952
want to be alone,
I can...No.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.830
No, stay.

37:59.450 --> 38:00.656
Staying.Good.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.132
Good.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.277
Did you just get back
from somewhere?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.709
Right.
Dirt under the fingernails,

38:10.760 --> 38:12.455
a little rough
around the edges, huh?

38:12.500 --> 38:15.674
Hmm. It's just a...

38:15.720 --> 38:17.768
a certain kind of tired
in your eyes.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.718
Right, you would know.

38:23.820 --> 38:27.460
What I hated most about, uh,
when Adam would get spun up--

38:27.520 --> 38:30.080
it wasn't that he was gone,
it was that...

38:30.130 --> 38:32.519
when he got back,
he couldn't, uh...

38:34.350 --> 38:35.783
...he couldn't tell me about it.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.742
Thanks.

38:42.490 --> 38:43.741
Let's just say, um...

38:45.710 --> 38:47.666
...someone made a mistake
a few years ago.

38:47.710 --> 38:50.668
When she was
really young.

38:50.710 --> 38:52.883
It was pretty big.

38:55.590 --> 38:56.932
Can I ask you a question?

38:56.980 --> 38:58.766
Yeah.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.594
You trust your daughter Hannah?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.857
Trust her? Like...

39:03.900 --> 39:06.334
with my car, or...?No, I mean trust her.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.371
Like, uh, with boys and drugs.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.386
In college, that whole thing?

39:10.430 --> 39:13.069
They have to grow up sometime.

39:13.130 --> 39:15.826
And... they have to make

39:15.870 --> 39:19.397
their own decisions and they
have to make their own mistakes.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.658
Huh. Right.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.396
Emma does, too.

39:26.450 --> 39:28.486
Yeah, I-I know that.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.792
I just don't... I don't know
how to let her, um...

39:32.760 --> 39:34.534
I just don't know.

39:38.630 --> 39:39.881
You know?
I know.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.589
Yeah.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.541
I trust Hannah.Mm-hmm.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.330
I trust her because...

39:47.950 --> 39:49.815
because she's still
Adam's daughter.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.469
And Emma is still

39:53.520 --> 39:55.863
your daughter.

39:55.910 --> 39:59.084
Yeah, she is.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.735
That's what scares me.

40:06.660 --> 40:09.618
Hey, I didn't know
you were still here.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.402
I figured I'd grab the last
two pair of decent socks.

40:12.450 --> 40:16.659
You should order more before you
leave us, Officer Lisa Davis.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.622
Not sure it's got a ring to it,
one that I like anyway.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.580
How did...?

40:26.770 --> 40:28.931
I'm sorry.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.333
Look, I was trying to find
a way to tell you.

40:31.380 --> 40:32.551
Telling the truth
hard to figure?

40:32.600 --> 40:34.591
Come on, it's not like
I was lying.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.336
That's exactly
what it was.

40:37.390 --> 40:38.869
No, actually, it wasn't.

40:41.740 --> 40:45.346
Look, Sonny, since
we...

40:45.390 --> 40:46.698
Hey, we should
talk about this.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.139
No, we shouldn't.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.785
All right, you just got to do
what you got to do,

40:50.830 --> 40:52.616
and that's leave.

40:52.660 --> 40:54.139
Truth is, you were right,

40:54.190 --> 40:56.488
it was a bad idea
from the start.

40:56.540 --> 40:59.498
Okay, so, let's just
keep it professional

40:59.540 --> 41:01.496
till you leave Bravo Team.

41:15.420 --> 41:17.468
You know, when I said
we should have a beer,

41:17.510 --> 41:19.239
I meant a couple
days ago.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.517
I got busy.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.039
Hey, can we get
a couple more?

41:23.690 --> 41:26.568
Spin up

41:26.610 --> 41:28.510
Yeah, still breathing.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.344
Cheers to that.

41:33.310 --> 41:36.746
So...

41:36.790 --> 41:39.748
My new book is about ﬁnished.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.576
We think it's gonna be bigger
than the first one.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.700
I was kind of hoping maybe
you would read the manuscript.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.752
You've always been
good with words.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.284
Sure.

41:51.330 --> 41:54.151
Okay.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.248
I got to take this.
It's my publisher.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.692
Hey, can you, uh,
can you turn this up?

42:11.700 --> 42:13.565
HOST :
How would you describe that job?

42:13.610 --> 42:15.692
Team.

42:15.750 --> 42:18.878
My next book focuses
a great deal on that,

42:18.920 --> 42:23.539
and the missions. The operations
that nobody knows about.

42:23.580 --> 42:26.629
You'd be surprised how often
we hear of SEAL missions

42:26.670 --> 42:28.570
and we don't
even know it.

42:28.630 --> 42:31.098
For example, just a couple
of months ago, Shia extremists

42:31.150 --> 42:34.449
threatened to poison the
water supply of Saudi Arabia,

42:34.500 --> 42:37.025
and it was the SEALs
who solved that problem.

42:37.070 --> 42:39.061
HOST:
How do you know?

42:39.120 --> 42:42.112
ASH: I have a firsthand account
from a SEAL who was there.
