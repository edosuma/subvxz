WEBVTT

00:49.699 --> 00:50.973
May I help you'?

00:51.034 --> 00:52.206
Oh!

00:52.268 --> 00:54.942
Um, how much is that one?

00:55.004 --> 00:56.108
Oh!

00:56.172 --> 00:57.378
Brilliant choice.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.944
That one is twelve-thousand
I believe.

01:03.346 --> 01:05.325
Would you like to see it'?

01:05.381 --> 01:06.291
Come on, Grace!

01:06.349 --> 01:07.589
We haven't got all day.

01:18.728 --> 01:21.140
Isn't he so
deliciously gorgeous?

01:21.197 --> 01:22.301
Tessa!

01:22.365 --> 01:24.140
What'?! Until he puts
a ring on that finger,

01:24.200 --> 01:25.679
you gotta keep
your options open.

01:25.735 --> 01:26.509
Not Stewart.

01:26.569 --> 01:27.741
Today's fifteen months.

01:28.004 --> 01:28.709
Are you serious'?

01:28.772 --> 01:30.547
My record's a measly two.

01:30.607 --> 01:31.984
Yeah, and get this...

01:32.041 --> 01:34.419
He says he has something special
to tell me tonight over dinner!

01:34.477 --> 01:36.753
Oooh, maybe he's gonna
pop the question.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.289
You have to tell me
all the juicy details...

01:47.724 --> 01:50.261
My parents love country livin'.

01:50.326 --> 01:53.398
Something about cleaner air...

01:53.463 --> 01:56.239
...fewer people to
contend with...

01:56.299 --> 01:59.280
...and friendly neighbors
who've always got your back.

01:59.335 --> 02:02.339
There'sjust one thing missing...

02:02.405 --> 02:04.612
Congratulations,
Dr. Masters!

02:04.674 --> 02:06.745
You're going to love this place.

02:06.810 --> 02:10.155
Yes sir, I believe I will.

02:17.153 --> 02:19.724
Mom, I'm home!

02:19.789 --> 02:24.761
Hi! Have fun with Tess'?

02:24.828 --> 02:28.105
You would not believe
the rock I saw today.

02:28.164 --> 02:29.404
Afull carat.

02:29.465 --> 02:32.639
Princess Cut.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.477
To die for!

02:34.537 --> 02:37.609
Think Stewart
can afford that and college'?

02:37.674 --> 02:40.314
Come help me pick
my dress for tonight!

02:42.078 --> 02:45.150
So what do you
like about Stewart?

02:45.215 --> 02:46.353
I don't know.

02:46.416 --> 02:51.798
He's really cute, and fun...
and smart!

02:51.855 --> 02:54.301
He made the dean's list
last semester.

02:54.357 --> 02:58.430
I knew a guy like that once.

02:58.494 --> 03:04.740
Grant ...Grant Williamson.

03:04.801 --> 03:07.247
The most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

03:07.303 --> 03:08.281
Really'?!

03:08.338 --> 03:10.079
What happened'?

03:10.139 --> 03:13.086
One of the
worst dates I ever had.

03:13.142 --> 03:15.679
All he could do was
talk about himself.

03:15.745 --> 03:17.850
Stewart's different.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.357
I know it's a
long-distance relationship,

03:21.417 --> 03:24.660
but how much could
somebody possibly change?

03:24.721 --> 03:26.598
We all change.

03:26.656 --> 03:29.193
But true love is
worth waiting for.

03:38.801 --> 03:43.147
How 'bout this one'?

03:43.206 --> 03:44.810
Perfect.

03:44.874 --> 03:47.480
Thanks Mom!

03:47.543 --> 03:49.750
I'd better get back to dinner.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.691
You mind telling your Dad it'll
be ready in about an hour'?

03:52.749 --> 03:53.557
Alright.

03:55.418 --> 03:56.761
That is pure gold.

04:00.256 --> 04:02.668
Dad, check this out!

04:02.725 --> 04:05.433
Pesky groundhogs.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.874
Don't worry,
I'll take care of 'em.

04:08.932 --> 04:10.434
Hi Daddy!

04:10.500 --> 04:11.774
Hello Princess.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.507
Mom's got dinner.

04:13.569 --> 04:14.604
How's it going?

04:14.671 --> 04:17.845
See for yourself.

04:17.906 --> 04:20.512
Oh!

04:20.576 --> 04:25.286
Well, we could always
move closer to Raleigh.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.349
Fewer pests...

04:26.416 --> 04:28.919
and a lot closer to Stewart.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.190
Grace, just look at this land...

04:33.256 --> 04:34.701
Our land.

04:34.757 --> 04:36.896
Been in the family
for three generations,

04:36.960 --> 04:39.702
and you'd give all that up
for some college jock'?

04:39.762 --> 04:40.706
Dad!

04:40.763 --> 04:42.674
I can't marry the farm.

04:42.732 --> 04:45.269
Well, you'd be surprised
what you can learn about love

04:45.335 --> 04:47.337
from a soybean.

04:47.403 --> 04:48.814
I've gotta
get ready for my date.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.680
Can we talk about this later?

04:53.843 --> 04:58.588
I'll have to walk her
down the aisle one day.

04:58.648 --> 05:01.254
But he better be
a really good man.

05:01.317 --> 05:04.196
Drew, time to eat!

05:04.253 --> 05:05.459
Coming!

05:11.260 --> 05:14.673
Please, oh, please
be mac 'n' cheese!

05:14.731 --> 05:16.677
Ewh ck!

05:16.733 --> 05:19.612
And what's wrong with
brussels sprouts, may I ask'?

05:19.669 --> 05:22.377
They're stinky
and squishy and...

05:22.438 --> 05:24.315
Tasty!

05:24.374 --> 05:27.719
Now not another word or you're
gonna get a second helping.

05:27.777 --> 05:29.256
Yes ma'am.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.354
Sorry I'm late.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.590
That's okay.

05:36.652 --> 05:38.222
But if we hope
to cover the mortgage,

05:38.287 --> 05:39.493
this harvest is critical.

05:39.555 --> 05:40.465
I know.

05:40.523 --> 05:42.560
I kept it warm for ya.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.662
Guess I'd better wash up then.

05:49.365 --> 05:50.537
Daddy!

05:50.600 --> 05:51.840
Been good for your momma'?

05:51.901 --> 05:52.845
Yep!

05:52.902 --> 05:54.279
Look what I carved!

05:54.337 --> 05:55.839
Thatta boy.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.475
He's looking good!

06:02.645 --> 06:03.646
Where's Grace?

06:03.713 --> 06:05.317
Stewart's
picking her up at seven.

06:05.381 --> 06:08.362
Why can't he just come
over here and eat with us'?

06:08.418 --> 06:09.795
And would you
have wanted to do that

06:09.852 --> 06:12.526
when we were dating?

06:12.588 --> 06:17.264
She's getting too
emotionally attached.

06:17.326 --> 06:19.397
We can talk about this later.

06:30.706 --> 06:32.310
You look lovely.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.718
Remember what I told you.

06:33.776 --> 06:36.382
Dad, it's Stewart.

06:36.446 --> 06:37.686
Don't worry, if he tries
to touch me

06:37.747 --> 06:39.920
I'll just punch him in the nose.

06:46.589 --> 06:47.567
Where is he?

06:49.025 --> 06:51.596
'Germ...

06:51.661 --> 06:53.834
Hello?...

06:53.896 --> 06:55.534
Grace who'?

06:55.598 --> 06:57.805
Drew, give me the phone!

07:01.704 --> 07:08.417
Stewart...
where are you'?!...

07:08.478 --> 07:14.087
WhatfP... Yeah,
I'll meet you there.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.920
Something the matter?

07:15.985 --> 07:20.092
No, he just wants me
to meet him at the Diner.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.338
Now let's pray!

07:37.073 --> 07:38.711
Hey, Grace!

07:38.774 --> 07:41.345
Over here!

07:43.679 --> 07:44.885
You remember Jake, dontchya?

07:44.947 --> 07:46.119
Hi.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.862
I thought "we" had a date...

07:48.918 --> 07:50.693
Oh them'?

07:50.753 --> 07:52.630
They're just college buds,
they won't be in town long.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.066
Ronnie!

07:59.128 --> 08:00.801
You made it!

08:00.863 --> 08:02.433
Whatzzup Stu!

08:02.498 --> 08:04.569
Whatzzup baby'?

08:04.634 --> 08:05.704
<i>Hey Guysâ€œ.!</i>

08:05.768 --> 08:06.644
Ronnie!

08:06.702 --> 08:08.010
Good to see ya,
you're looking great...

08:08.070 --> 08:10.573
oh, french fries!

08:13.543 --> 08:17.389
What can I get for you'?

08:17.446 --> 08:19.926
Um, I'll have a burger,
fries and a soda.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.052
Same please.

08:21.117 --> 08:22.061
Ok.

08:22.118 --> 08:23.096
So good to see you.

08:23.152 --> 08:24.426
Good to see you too buddy!

08:24.487 --> 08:26.558
Alright, let's get it on...
Rematch!

08:26.622 --> 08:27.430
Let's go... right now.

08:27.490 --> 08:28.662
Come on!

08:28.724 --> 08:29.600
Let's go.

08:29.659 --> 08:30.467
What is this'?

08:30.526 --> 08:31.436
Fine!

08:31.494 --> 08:32.164
Tradition.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.841
One... two... three!

08:35.898 --> 08:37.934
Weaksauce.

08:38.000 --> 08:38.909
He's got you...

08:38.967 --> 08:40.470
You cheated.

08:40.535 --> 08:41.809
It's the beard.

08:41.871 --> 08:42.941
Some things never change.

08:43.005 --> 08:43.573
Alright, here you go.

08:43.639 --> 08:46.119
You ready for this'?

08:46.175 --> 08:48.155
Oh I got you on this one.

08:48.211 --> 08:50.885
Ha! Top that.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.051
Alright, one last one.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.651
Here we go.

08:54.717 --> 08:57.095
Stewart!
We need to talk!

08:59.855 --> 09:01.095
I thought you had
something special

09:01.157 --> 09:03.535
you wanted to tell me.

09:03.593 --> 09:05.436
I do.

09:05.494 --> 09:07.565
Listen up everyone!

09:09.865 --> 09:11.105
We're engaged.

09:11.167 --> 09:14.512
Congratulations!

09:14.570 --> 09:17.574
That's awesome!

09:17.640 --> 09:19.677
Yeah, we're pretty stoked.

09:19.742 --> 09:20.948
V\/hen's the date'?

09:21.010 --> 09:22.512
We'll figure it out.

09:25.715 --> 09:28.491
Armed and ready, over!

09:36.192 --> 09:37.170
Grace?

09:40.696 --> 09:41.902
Grace?

09:45.668 --> 09:47.147
You were right.

09:47.203 --> 09:49.706
What happened'?

09:49.772 --> 09:53.117
I felt like a third wheel
on my own date,

09:53.175 --> 09:57.646
and I watched him with his ring
on another girl's finger.

09:57.713 --> 10:01.490
Oh honey, I'm so sorry.

10:01.550 --> 10:02.824
Why does this
keep happening to me'?

10:02.885 --> 10:05.525
First Bryce, then Stewart.

10:05.588 --> 10:09.001
All the guys around here
are total jerks!!

10:09.058 --> 10:11.004
I shoulda seen it coming.

10:11.060 --> 10:14.667
He was checking out other girls
on our last date.

10:14.730 --> 10:18.576
It sounds like the Lord
kept you from a big disaster.

10:18.634 --> 10:19.942
I'm beginning to think

10:20.002 --> 10:23.245
He doesn't even
want me to get married.

10:23.306 --> 10:26.116
Whenever I used
to get discouraged,

10:26.175 --> 10:28.746
my momma used to say,

10:28.811 --> 10:33.658
"Katherine, hope deferred
makes the heart sick,

10:33.716 --> 10:42.067
but when the desire comes
it's a tree of life."

10:42.124 --> 10:46.095
She was right, you know.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.665
Thanks Mom.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.541
Besides, the night's not
a total loss.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.206
Why don't we all play a game'?

10:54.270 --> 10:55.647
Do I have to'?

10:55.705 --> 10:59.676
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.983
Okay, I'll go change.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.795
All clear.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.146
My turn.

11:26.202 --> 11:27.647
Yes!

11:31.941 --> 11:34.945
"I'm Stewart and I'm losing
at the Game of Life."

11:35.010 --> 11:37.820
Drew, cut it out!

11:37.880 --> 11:40.156
Ah, more delicious cookies?

11:40.216 --> 11:41.593
Thank you!

11:41.650 --> 11:42.788
You're welcome.

11:51.927 --> 11:53.270
"Twin sons are born.

11:53.329 --> 11:54.774
Collect presents."

11:58.267 --> 12:00.076
All you girls think
about is getting married

12:00.136 --> 12:01.638
and having kids.

12:01.704 --> 12:03.081
Marriage is a
gift from God, son.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.210
I don't want to get married.

12:05.274 --> 12:08.221
Remind me of that
in a decade, okay?

12:08.277 --> 12:09.779
Dad, do you think

12:09.845 --> 12:11.256
there's just one perfect
person out there

12:11.313 --> 12:14.089
that we're supposed
to find and marry'?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.892
That's a good question, Robert.

12:16.952 --> 12:19.796
I think it's not so much about
finding the perfect person

12:19.855 --> 12:22.859
as it is becoming the person
God meant you to be.

12:26.729 --> 12:28.037
Mmm, my turn.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.850
Thought you could
use a little break.

12:39.909 --> 12:40.717
Thanks, dear.

12:40.776 --> 12:42.084
Just leave it on the desk.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.788
"Trustworthiness,

12:49.852 --> 12:52.162
"a willingness to
lead his family,

12:52.221 --> 12:55.327
an understanding of
his wife's needs"

12:55.391 --> 12:56.768
Sounds like a good book.

12:56.826 --> 12:58.430
Convicting's more like it.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.334
Pastor highly recommended it.

13:01.397 --> 13:03.707
Speaking of pastors...

13:03.766 --> 13:05.211
you know at weddings
when he asks,

13:05.267 --> 13:07.941
"Who gives this woman
to be married?"...

13:08.003 --> 13:09.983
ever wondered where
that came from?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.110
Hadn't really thought about it.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.916
Jeremiah 29:6.

13:14.977 --> 13:18.015
"Fathers give their
daughters in marriage."

13:18.080 --> 13:19.753
So what are you saying?

13:19.815 --> 13:22.159
Who am I going to give
our daughter to'?

13:22.218 --> 13:25.893
Most young men today have no
clue what it means to be a man.

13:25.955 --> 13:29.300
They're out there.

13:29.358 --> 13:32.805
I should know.

13:32.862 --> 13:33.863
Duty calls.

13:50.045 --> 13:53.254
Andrew Miles Anderson!

13:53.315 --> 13:55.420
I want to see you
in my study young man.

13:55.484 --> 13:56.758
Uh-Oh!

13:56.819 --> 13:58.162
<i>Wham ya do now'?</i>

13:58.220 --> 13:59.790
Have a seat.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.136
Son, did you write this'?

14:05.194 --> 14:07.970
- "Pretty girl, makes great
mac and cheese,

14:08.030 --> 14:10.067
we need a good man
to come and get her."

14:10.132 --> 14:13.739
She does make
the best mac 'n' cheese.

14:13.802 --> 14:16.180
Son, there's more to
relationships than food!

14:16.238 --> 14:17.410
But Dad, Kenny said,

14:17.473 --> 14:22.149
"The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach."

14:25.014 --> 14:25.958
Wait here!

14:30.986 --> 14:32.124
We'll deal with this later.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.768
Hi!
Is it here'?

14:40.829 --> 14:42.172
I mean, is she here'?

14:42.231 --> 14:44.768
I mean... I'm here about
the macaroni and cheese,

14:44.833 --> 14:47.313
and the girl that
needs taken away.

14:47.369 --> 14:48.973
Unless of course she's
already been taken,

14:49.038 --> 14:51.211
in which case, hey, I'll just
take the macaroni and cheese.

14:51.273 --> 14:53.913
I'm sorry,
there's been a big mistake.

15:03.218 --> 15:05.789
Susannah, run away,

15:05.854 --> 15:08.460
you really took my heart away,

15:08.524 --> 15:11.937
you really found me
in my dreams...

15:11.994 --> 15:13.530
Your daughter,
she might need these

15:13.596 --> 15:15.872
when she catches a
glimpse of me, okay.

15:15.931 --> 15:17.569
Technically, I already
have a girlfriend,

15:17.833 --> 15:19.335
just doing a little
comparative shopping,

15:19.401 --> 15:20.277
weighing my options,

15:20.336 --> 15:22.816
always looking for that
...upgrade.

15:22.871 --> 15:25.511
I never thought I'd be
the man knocking on your door,

15:25.574 --> 15:28.282
asking to meet your daughter
that I've never met.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.186
But you know what'?

15:29.244 --> 15:31.554
It takes a lot of humility
in a relationship,

15:31.614 --> 15:34.117
and that's what I'm all
about... putting her first.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.958
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

15:36.018 --> 15:36.928
about your daughter.

15:36.986 --> 15:37.987
Is she pretty clean'?

15:38.053 --> 15:39.464
Tidy?
Organized'? Neat'?

15:39.521 --> 15:42.934
Clutter... l can't do
clutter... clutter's not okay,

15:42.992 --> 15:46.565
hoarding's not okay either,
unless she hoards comic books.

15:46.629 --> 15:48.609
Granted, I won't be there
all the time,

15:48.864 --> 15:50.104
I'll be out making the money.

15:50.165 --> 15:52.167
Now granted she'll have
to do some of that too.

15:52.234 --> 15:53.907
No, no, there's been a mistake.

15:53.969 --> 15:55.380
Now granted
I don't even have a job,

15:55.437 --> 15:58.384
but that's something I can
work on... heh, work on.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.044
I can do business,
advertising, sales,

16:00.109 --> 16:01.179
marketing, tennis...

16:01.243 --> 16:04.156
best frisbee golfer
you will ever see!

16:04.213 --> 16:06.215
Now granted these
are just a few of my thoughts,

16:06.281 --> 16:08.158
granted we'll probably need
to talk more about this,

16:08.217 --> 16:09.287
perhaps on our first date.

16:09.351 --> 16:11.627
Granted she'll probably
have to buy her first date.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.560
But there's one thing
I want you to know sir,

16:13.622 --> 16:16.296
I will never take your
daughter for granted!

16:16.358 --> 16:17.200
Goodbye!

16:22.264 --> 16:24.574
Yes, hi, I was
looking for information

16:24.633 --> 16:28.376
on a recent graduate
...Clint Masters'?

16:31.907 --> 16:36.083
Do you know where...

16:36.145 --> 16:42.585
East Bend Family Clinic...

16:42.651 --> 16:48.602
Great, thank you... Yes, thanks.

17:02.237 --> 17:03.580
Guess who'?

17:03.639 --> 17:05.084
Farmer girl.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.517
Uh!

17:06.575 --> 17:08.179
How'd you even know it was me'?!

17:08.242 --> 17:09.688
Your perfume.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.185
It stinks.

17:11.246 --> 17:12.247
Thanks a lot!

17:12.314 --> 17:14.453
Can't even get any love
from my best friend.

17:14.516 --> 17:15.358
Relax.

17:15.416 --> 17:16.691
Just get a new brand.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.124
Smell this.

17:18.186 --> 17:19.426
The guys love it.

17:19.488 --> 17:23.128
Any more sage advice'?

17:23.192 --> 17:24.535
Since you mentioned it,

17:24.593 --> 17:26.071
if you're ever gonna
nab a hot guy,

17:26.127 --> 17:28.039
you need to get a new wardrobe.

17:28.097 --> 17:32.102
Stop dressing like your mom.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.669
I need a latte.

17:33.736 --> 17:34.714
Want anything?

17:34.970 --> 17:35.675
Nah, I gotta run.

17:35.738 --> 17:36.716
Hope you don't mind.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.451
Do I have a choice'?

17:40.542 --> 17:42.146
Your bad luck
can't last forever.

17:42.211 --> 17:44.350
I'm sure the perfect guy is
like right around the corner.

17:44.413 --> 17:46.086
Yeah right.

17:54.723 --> 17:57.727
Hello, how can I help you'?

17:57.993 --> 18:02.533
Double latte, extra cream.

18:02.598 --> 18:04.600
Have we...
have we met before'?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.442
Please, I just need a coffee.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.279
Alright.

18:19.281 --> 18:20.487
There ya go.

18:30.392 --> 18:32.463
Rings!

18:32.528 --> 18:35.031
You were after the big one.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.202
I'm Jared.

18:37.266 --> 18:39.303
Thank you for reminding me

18:39.368 --> 18:41.644
of the most horrible
day of my life!

18:41.703 --> 18:46.413
Ooookay...

18:53.248 --> 18:54.420
Cover for me.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.067
Got dumped, huh'?

19:01.123 --> 19:02.261
VWI you please
stop following me'?

19:02.324 --> 19:03.098
Take it easy.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.536
We're practically old friends.

19:05.594 --> 19:06.732
Okay Jared,

19:06.795 --> 19:09.366
since we're supposed to
know each other so well,

19:09.431 --> 19:10.637
perhaps you can fill me
in on a few minor details.

19:10.699 --> 19:11.404
Okay-

19:11.466 --> 19:12.467
Whaddya wanna know'?

19:12.534 --> 19:16.311
For starters, how'd you got from
the jewelry store to here'?

19:16.371 --> 19:20.217
Ok, I drove.

19:20.275 --> 19:22.221
Okay, okay!

19:22.277 --> 19:23.756
Look, I just didn't
like dressing up,

19:23.812 --> 19:24.654
wearing a tie.

19:24.713 --> 19:28.490
Plus, this is
just more my style.

19:28.550 --> 19:29.255
Much more romantic

19:29.318 --> 19:31.320
then helping couples
pick out their rings.

19:31.386 --> 19:32.330
Maybe.

19:32.387 --> 19:34.128
But I've stood
behind that counter

19:34.189 --> 19:37.534
and watched people fall
in love over coffee.

19:37.593 --> 19:42.542
It can happen anywhere, anytime.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.511
And... maybe even to us.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.706
But you hardly even know me.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.340
That's something
I'd like to change.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.327
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:06.388 --> 20:14.273
Listen, would you think it
too forward if I called you'?

20:14.329 --> 20:16.468
So many firsts.

20:21.670 --> 20:23.308
Thank you.

20:41.556 --> 20:43.263
Morning, ladies.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.536
Whatchya working on?

20:47.596 --> 20:51.339
It's a project for
my interior design course.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.402
It counts for half my grade.

20:53.468 --> 20:54.538
Whaddya ya say,

20:54.603 --> 20:56.913
when you're finished with that,
we go welcome the new neighbor'?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.344
The Bates farm'?

20:58.407 --> 21:00.546
Thought we'd all give 'em
a warm Carolina greeting.

21:00.609 --> 21:02.611
I could bake a pie.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.419
I'll help you!

21:04.479 --> 21:06.720
You always think
of the perfect touch.

21:06.782 --> 21:08.352
Oh hush.

21:11.586 --> 21:12.530
Jim Anderson.

21:12.587 --> 21:13.429
Clint Masters.

21:13.488 --> 21:14.296
Good to meet you Clint.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.859
This is my wife, Katherine,
and the rest of our family here.

21:16.925 --> 21:18.461
Oh!

21:18.527 --> 21:19.471
Hmmm, this is my favorite.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.529
Thank you so much.

21:20.595 --> 21:21.903
Make yourselves comfortable.

21:21.964 --> 21:23.170
Can I get you
anything to drink'?

21:23.231 --> 21:25.336
No, we can't stay long.

21:36.478 --> 21:38.458
You've made quite
a few changes to the place.

21:38.513 --> 21:40.356
I hope they're
all good changes, Ma'am.

21:40.415 --> 21:42.759
Yes, I didn't mean
to imply that they weren't.

21:42.818 --> 21:47.733
You see, Judy... Mrs. Bates...
and I were very close.

21:47.789 --> 21:49.826
We shared many
happy afternoons here.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.961
I see.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.570
Perhaps you can advise me
if I've overlooked anything.

21:53.628 --> 21:55.437
You get rid of that old stove?

21:55.497 --> 21:56.669
Not yet.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.235
It burnt some of my best scones.

21:59.301 --> 22:01.281
Yeah, but they
made good target practice.

22:03.972 --> 22:05.349
That picture there.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.511
Who is that'?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.613
Dad was a champion
rodeo rider in his day.

22:09.678 --> 22:12.750
See, I told you
this guy would be cool.

22:12.814 --> 22:15.385
So why East Bend'?

22:15.450 --> 22:18.363
Well, afierfinishing
med school at Wake,

22:18.420 --> 22:21.458
a spot opened up at the clinic,
so, here I am.

22:21.523 --> 22:23.264
So you're a doctor'?

22:23.325 --> 22:24.497
Yes.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.732
Hope to have my own
family practice someday.

22:26.795 --> 22:28.001
Pardon my saying so,

22:28.263 --> 22:30.834
but you look so young to
be practicing medicine.

22:30.899 --> 22:33.436
I guess school
hasn't taken it's toll then.

22:33.502 --> 22:35.311
Believe it or not, I'm 28.

22:35.370 --> 22:37.008
I admire your dedication.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.013
Your parents must be very proud.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.844
Thank you, sir.

22:40.909 --> 22:41.910
Don't know if you've had time

22:41.977 --> 22:43.422
to find a good church home yet,

22:43.478 --> 22:45.856
but you're more than
welcome to join us.

22:45.914 --> 22:46.824
Appreciate the invitation.

22:46.882 --> 22:47.860
I'd love to.

22:47.916 --> 22:48.894
Great!

22:55.857 --> 22:57.427
Have a sec'?

22:57.492 --> 22:59.369
Sure, what's up?

23:03.999 --> 23:06.843
I met a guy at the
coffee shop the other day.

23:06.902 --> 23:10.679
Actually, we met before
but that's a long story.

23:10.739 --> 23:14.346
Anyway, his name is Jared.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.013
At first he kinda teased me,

23:16.078 --> 23:18.820
but then he was really nice
and helped me out.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.450
I bet he did.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.055
I want to meet this guy
before you go out with him.

23:25.320 --> 23:25.957
Don't you trust me'?

23:26.021 --> 23:29.025
I don't trust him!

23:29.091 --> 23:31.332
Actually, your mother and I
have been concerned about you.

23:31.393 --> 23:33.532
I'm not a child anymore.

23:36.731 --> 23:38.802
I've been doing some reading.

23:38.867 --> 23:39.709
You might be
interested to hear...

23:40.635 --> 23:44.048
I'll get it.

23:44.106 --> 23:46.313
Sweetheart, wait!

23:50.712 --> 23:54.421
I'm here about the ad
for a pretty girl who can cook'?

23:54.483 --> 23:57.555
There must be
some sort of mistake...

23:57.619 --> 23:59.724
Wait a minute...
let me see that...

24:03.758 --> 24:05.931
Drew! Just wait till
I get my hands on youl!

24:08.964 --> 24:10.500
May I help you'?

24:10.565 --> 24:13.102
Ah, you must
be the one from the ad.

24:13.368 --> 24:16.042
I bet you could cook just
about anything, Buttercup.

24:16.104 --> 24:17.981
How are you around bikes'?

24:18.039 --> 24:21.111
I'm sorry,
but that ad is closed.

24:23.945 --> 24:25.549
Who was it this time'?

24:25.614 --> 24:27.890
You don't even wanna know.

24:27.949 --> 24:28.757
Where's Grace?

24:28.817 --> 24:30.421
We were having a nice
little conversation.

24:30.485 --> 24:32.965
Oh, she's chasing after Drew.

24:33.021 --> 24:34.898
That might take a while!

24:34.956 --> 24:36.060
I'll be in the barn.

24:36.124 --> 24:37.899
That boy, that boy, that boy...

24:44.432 --> 24:45.934
Having any success?

24:48.537 --> 24:51.609
Nigel Livengood,
East Bend Realty.

24:51.673 --> 24:53.710
Something I can do for you'?

24:53.775 --> 24:55.652
I sold a home in this area

24:55.710 --> 24:58.486
and saw this fine piece
of land you've got here.

24:58.547 --> 25:00.754
It's not for sale.

25:00.815 --> 25:04.592
Well, I'm sure you
have some sentimental reason

25:04.653 --> 25:08.760
to hang on to it,
but I'm prepared to pay...

25:08.823 --> 25:10.734
handsomely.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.965
No thanks.

25:13.028 --> 25:16.407
Oh, that's too bad.

25:16.464 --> 25:17.966
According to my sources,

25:18.033 --> 25:21.879
there's a notice of pending
default against the property.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.180
If you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.758
Standing offer.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.034
Get off my land.

26:01.243 --> 26:03.052
Uh, hey!

26:03.111 --> 26:05.091
Jared!

26:05.146 --> 26:06.489
What are you doing here'?

26:06.548 --> 26:09.085
Where you
expecting someone else'?

26:09.150 --> 26:12.063
No, no, I, uh...

26:12.120 --> 26:13.690
How'd you find me'?

26:13.755 --> 26:15.098
Ever heard of the internet?

26:17.959 --> 26:19.734
I thought you
were gonna call me.

26:19.794 --> 26:24.709
Thought I'd see
you in person instead.

26:24.766 --> 26:26.803
My Dad wanted
to meet you anyway,

26:26.868 --> 26:28.245
so, come on in.

26:28.503 --> 26:29.777
Ok.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.211
Dad, this is Jared,

26:35.277 --> 26:38.087
the guy I was telling you
about earlier'?

26:38.146 --> 26:38.920
Hello, Jared.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.050
Hello. Pleasure.

26:40.115 --> 26:41.594
This is my wife Katherine.

26:41.650 --> 26:43.561
Oh, hi Katherine!

26:43.618 --> 26:47.088
If you have a minute,
why don't we sit down and talk'?

26:47.155 --> 26:47.997
I'd love to,

26:48.056 --> 26:50.662
but I was just on my way
to get a shake,

26:50.725 --> 26:55.071
and stopped by to see
if Grace wanted to come'?

26:55.130 --> 26:59.135
If it's alright?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.202
Don't be out late.

27:01.269 --> 27:02.612
Yes, sir.

27:13.748 --> 27:16.752
I really like your family.

27:16.818 --> 27:18.923
They're all right.

27:18.987 --> 27:19.988
Tell me about yours.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.159
There's not much to tell.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.101
Dad left home when I was four

27:24.159 --> 27:27.106
so I really don't
know him that well.

27:27.162 --> 27:29.199
Sorry to hear that.

27:29.264 --> 27:32.143
And my Mom, it was really
hard for her to make ends meet,

27:32.200 --> 27:36.080
so I left home too
when I was 17.

27:36.137 --> 27:40.313
Wow, sounds tough.

27:40.575 --> 27:45.888
Eh, I kinda like the freedom.

27:45.947 --> 27:48.120
You ever plan on settling down?

27:50.952 --> 27:54.900
Um, maybe.

27:54.956 --> 27:57.197
If I find the right girl.

28:51.212 --> 28:52.919
This your place?

28:52.981 --> 28:55.689
Yeah, I promise it looks
a little better on the inside.

29:01.022 --> 29:01.898
Ugh!

29:01.956 --> 29:06.302
Just look at my hair,
it's a mess!

29:06.361 --> 29:08.034
I am.

29:11.032 --> 29:12.943
Wait!

29:13.001 --> 29:14.947
What'?

29:15.003 --> 29:17.108
Not till you put a ring on it.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.153
Princess Cut.

29:20.208 --> 29:22.779
You take this commitment
stuff pretty serious, don't ya?

29:22.844 --> 29:24.152
Of course.

29:24.212 --> 29:26.249
Don't you?

29:26.314 --> 29:29.022
Why don't you come in,
get dried off,

29:29.083 --> 29:31.427
and I'll take you home'?

29:31.686 --> 29:34.724
I can't.

29:34.789 --> 29:37.395
I shouldn't.

29:37.459 --> 29:40.201
We wouldn't be alone,
if that's what's worrying ya.

29:40.261 --> 29:42.935
My roommate's always in
there playing video games.

29:42.997 --> 29:44.806
I don't know...

29:44.866 --> 29:47.369
Tell you what,
Why don't I go check and see.

30:32.981 --> 30:35.154
Maybe Grace was right.

30:35.216 --> 30:36.786
Care to fill me in?

30:43.892 --> 30:51.208
I know things are tough,
but we'll make it through.

30:51.266 --> 30:57.808
Couple weeks ago a guy
made an offer on the farm.

30:57.872 --> 31:00.318
It was enough to get us
out of debt...

31:00.375 --> 31:01.285
and then some.

31:01.342 --> 31:03.185
It's been in
your family for so long...

31:08.449 --> 31:12.397
I just want what's best
for the kids, you know'?

31:12.453 --> 31:14.763
If only I could
get that combine working!

31:19.494 --> 31:21.303
This is Grace, leave a message!

31:21.362 --> 31:24.275
It's not like her
not to answer the phone.

31:24.332 --> 31:27.404
Her battery's probably dead.

31:27.468 --> 31:30.381
I can't put my finger on it,

31:30.438 --> 31:33.180
but something's been
bothering me about Jared.

31:35.343 --> 31:37.220
Ok.

31:37.278 --> 31:41.124
Well, why don't we have
him over for dinner'?

31:41.182 --> 31:43.389
That way we can all
get to know him better.

31:43.451 --> 31:44.953
I'd like that.

31:50.391 --> 31:52.268
This better be Grace!

32:00.268 --> 32:01.440
Look at you!

32:01.502 --> 32:03.243
You trying to catch a cold'?

32:03.304 --> 32:04.180
Honey, grab some towels.

32:04.238 --> 32:05.512
Mom, I'm fine, really.

32:05.573 --> 32:06.415
What happened'?

32:06.474 --> 32:07.179
Where've you been'?

32:07.241 --> 32:07.582
Nothing!

32:07.842 --> 32:10.345
We just got caught in the rain,
that's all.

32:10.411 --> 32:12.220
I'm glad you're okay.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.088
I'm fine!

32:13.147 --> 32:15.058
Now please excuse me,
while I get cleaned up.

32:32.967 --> 32:34.378
Hey, what's up, how'd it go?

32:34.435 --> 32:36.506
For the first time in my life,

32:36.571 --> 32:40.144
I'm not sure what to do.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.313
Why? Did he
force himself on you'?

32:42.377 --> 32:46.348
No, not exactly.

32:46.414 --> 32:48.985
He kissed me.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.054
And you're
complaining about that'?

32:52.120 --> 32:54.361
I've kissed tons of guys,
it's not a big deal.

32:54.422 --> 32:57.426
Then why doesn't it feel right'?

32:57.492 --> 32:59.233
My stomach's all a whirl.

32:59.293 --> 33:01.102
You mean it
wasn't what you wanted?

33:01.162 --> 33:03.142
I know it wasn't
what my parents wanted.

33:03.197 --> 33:05.507
Stop worrying about them.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.513
You can't be tied
to them forever.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.549
But now every
time we're together

33:10.605 --> 33:12.642
he wants to go
somewhere secluded!

33:12.907 --> 33:14.978
And what's wrong with that'?

33:15.043 --> 33:18.047
I'd feel better telling
my parents I had a great time

33:18.112 --> 33:21.286
if I didn't have to leave
out pans of the story.

33:21.349 --> 33:24.296
Listen, you
care about him, right'?

33:24.352 --> 33:26.992
Yeah... I think so.

33:27.055 --> 33:28.557
Then stop making such a big deal

33:28.623 --> 33:30.330
over a simple little kiss!

33:30.391 --> 33:32.564
It's totally unrealistic, right'?

33:32.627 --> 33:34.129
Come on Grace.

33:34.195 --> 33:35.435
Maybe it's just me.

33:35.496 --> 33:36.668
Hey, I know!

33:36.931 --> 33:39.411
Why don't you call
my Mom's therapist?

33:39.467 --> 33:41.606
Your mom has a therapist?

33:41.669 --> 33:46.209
Yeah, doesn't everybody'?

33:46.274 --> 33:48.185
I don't know,
I just think that...

33:48.242 --> 33:49.346
Aw come on,
what do you got to lose'?

33:49.410 --> 33:50.582
The first session's free.

33:54.515 --> 33:56.153
Okay-

33:56.217 --> 33:57.992
Have a good night, okay?

34:11.364 --> 34:12.105
Come in!

34:14.235 --> 34:15.407
Mrs. Ludlow'?

34:15.469 --> 34:18.076
Grace, Darling,
come in, come in!

34:21.007 --> 34:23.147
I hope I'm not too early.

34:23.210 --> 34:24.485
Oh no, no, not at all.

34:24.545 --> 34:26.252
Come in. Come in.

34:28.282 --> 34:29.260
Please make
yourself comfortable,

34:29.317 --> 34:36.393
have a seat.

34:36.456 --> 34:38.596
What's troubling you, Dear'?

34:38.659 --> 34:42.106
I'm seeing this guy
that I care about,

34:42.163 --> 34:45.143
but I'm not sure why
I don't feel right

34:45.199 --> 34:48.304
about our relationship.

34:48.369 --> 34:53.545
I like being with him,
I just feel inhibited somehow.

34:53.608 --> 34:56.452
In what way'?

34:56.511 --> 34:59.549
I don't know...

34:59.614 --> 35:01.025
it's just that,
every time we're together

35:01.082 --> 35:03.255
he wants to be physical.

35:03.317 --> 35:06.093
You know... hug, and kiss,
and stuff like that.

35:06.154 --> 35:09.260
It makes me uncomfortable.

35:09.323 --> 35:11.394
Any past relationships?

35:11.459 --> 35:14.065
Too many.

35:14.128 --> 35:17.234
I feel like my heart's been
passed around like a football.

35:17.298 --> 35:21.371
Which is one thing
I really love about Jared,

35:21.435 --> 35:24.109
he says the sweetest things.

35:24.172 --> 35:27.085
He makes me feel...
wanted.

35:27.141 --> 35:31.317
But when he starts touching me,
I feel... guilty.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.321
Grace, what I'm hearing

35:39.387 --> 35:42.664
is a woman in
search of identity.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.203
But identity is irrational,

35:45.259 --> 35:48.604
a tension between your conscious
and subconscious mind.

35:48.663 --> 35:51.166
In order to remove your guilt,
you have to feel free

35:51.232 --> 35:54.577
to construct yourself
within a new framework.

35:54.635 --> 35:55.739
In other words,

35:55.803 --> 35:57.578
perhaps your inhibitions
are telling you

35:57.638 --> 36:01.176
that it's time to try
a starter marriage.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.050
Awhat?

36:02.109 --> 36:05.181
A starter marriage,
a "trial run" of sorts.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.123
You know, it's a place
where you begin,

36:07.181 --> 36:10.458
but it's not where
you hope to end up.

36:10.518 --> 36:13.124
I'm not sure I'm following you.

36:13.187 --> 36:15.098
You do want
to get married, don't you'?

36:15.156 --> 36:16.601
Yes, but...

36:16.657 --> 36:20.503
Then you must facilitate
the breaking down of barriers.

36:20.561 --> 36:22.097
Are you suggesting

36:22.163 --> 36:24.609
that in order to
overcome my inhibitions

36:24.665 --> 36:27.578
I should first live with this
guy without being married?

36:27.635 --> 36:30.115
Well, I wouldn't
have put it in those words,

36:30.171 --> 36:33.084
but this does commence the
process of reconstruction.

36:33.140 --> 36:35.245
But that wouldn't be right!

36:35.309 --> 36:36.811
Well, how will you
know the shoe fits

36:36.878 --> 36:38.482
until you try it on?

36:38.546 --> 36:39.820
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ludlow,

36:39.881 --> 36:42.555
but I think I've
wasted your time.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.494
Are you sure, darling'?

36:44.552 --> 36:45.622
Would you please excuse me'?

36:45.686 --> 36:47.529
You've still have
time left in your free session?

36:47.588 --> 36:48.828
<i>Gum run
bye Mrs. mam!</i>

36:48.890 --> 36:51.131
Think on what I've
said, Darling.

36:53.661 --> 36:55.538
Hmph!

36:55.596 --> 36:57.803
What an odd little girl.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.346
Perfect.

37:07.408 --> 37:08.478
Good!

37:11.612 --> 37:13.319
Drew!

37:13.381 --> 37:14.655
Sorry.

37:14.715 --> 37:17.594
Drew, look what you just did!

37:17.652 --> 37:18.630
Sorry! I

37:21.389 --> 37:23.232
What is going on here'?

37:23.291 --> 37:24.702
What am I gonna do?

37:24.759 --> 37:27.740
This is my final project,
and it's due tomorrow!

37:27.795 --> 37:29.672
We'll figure something out.

37:29.730 --> 37:33.371
Sometimes I wish
you weren't even my brother.

37:33.434 --> 37:35.641
Just go away and leave me alone!

37:35.703 --> 37:37.341
Grace!

37:46.948 --> 37:49.929
Drew, wait, come back!

37:50.184 --> 37:52.721
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

38:04.265 --> 38:05.767
Well, I appreciate
your willingness to help.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.335
Sure, anytime.

38:07.401 --> 38:09.244
Have a good one.

38:09.303 --> 38:09.804
You too.

38:26.587 --> 38:27.361
Grace, you okayl'?

38:27.421 --> 38:28.331
It's Drew!

38:28.389 --> 38:29.493
I didn't see him.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.294
What happened'?

38:33.361 --> 38:34.704
Drew, you alright buddy??

38:34.762 --> 38:36.571
L...l fell off my bike.

38:36.630 --> 38:37.608
You okay'?

38:37.665 --> 38:39.474
Is he alright?

38:39.533 --> 38:40.807
Does it hurt'?

38:40.868 --> 38:42.939
Are you hurt anywherel'?

38:43.004 --> 38:44.449
No...

38:44.505 --> 38:45.279
Look at me.

38:45.339 --> 38:47.580
<i>I'm sump!</i>

38:47.641 --> 38:50.485
Hey... it's gonna be okay.

38:54.682 --> 38:56.286
Let me see your arm,.

38:56.350 --> 38:58.227
Does it hurt when I touch here'?

38:58.285 --> 39:00.265
Can you move your fingers?

39:00.321 --> 39:01.561
Yeah'?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.830
No pain down here...'?

39:06.894 --> 39:08.931
No...

39:08.996 --> 39:10.475
<i>Is he 0k'?</i>

39:10.531 --> 39:12.238
Yeah, he seems fine.

39:12.299 --> 39:13.903
Praise God!

39:13.968 --> 39:15.538
Looks like the bike
took the worst of it,

39:15.603 --> 39:17.583
and Drew here
just took a tumble.

39:17.638 --> 39:18.241
Tell you what,

39:18.305 --> 39:19.648
you want to try
to stand up buddy?

39:19.707 --> 39:20.708
You okay to do that'?

39:24.512 --> 39:25.889
You gave us a scare there man.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.289
Thank you Clint.

39:27.348 --> 39:28.884
I'll come by and
check on you later, okay'?

39:28.949 --> 39:31.589
I'd appreciate that.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.899
Grace, is that you'?

39:41.962 --> 39:43.464
I'm gonna go lay down.

39:43.531 --> 39:46.808
Are you and Drew okay'?

39:46.867 --> 39:48.813
He'll be fine!

40:03.851 --> 40:05.524
Grace?

40:05.586 --> 40:07.429
Are you okay'?!

40:07.488 --> 40:09.729
I'm fine...

40:09.790 --> 40:14.364
You know I'm always
here for you if you wanna talk.

40:14.428 --> 40:16.999
Oh, Mom!

40:17.064 --> 40:19.476
Everything's a mess!

40:23.504 --> 40:26.576
I've been so foolish,

40:26.640 --> 40:29.450
trying to handle
things on my own.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.514
I knew that if I stuck
around after my dates with Jared

40:32.580 --> 40:36.528
that you'd ask all about it.

40:36.584 --> 40:37.756
Grace...

40:37.818 --> 40:38.990
I hate this, I just hate it!

40:39.053 --> 40:42.660
I love you,

40:42.723 --> 40:45.932
and nothing you've done
will ever change that.

40:54.969 --> 40:56.971
That night it rained,

40:57.037 --> 41:00.450
Jared wanted to
show me his place.

41:00.508 --> 41:03.045
And he started stroking my hair,

41:03.110 --> 41:08.355
and he kissed me...
and he wouldn't stop.

41:08.415 --> 41:12.659
I was so confused,
I felt trapped...

41:12.720 --> 41:17.533
and Tessa recommended
I talk to her mom's therapist,

41:17.591 --> 41:24.065
and she said I need
a starter marriage.

41:24.131 --> 41:25.872
Oh honey!

41:37.811 --> 41:40.724
Why does love
have to be so complicated?

41:46.520 --> 41:48.727
I think your father
may have some answers.

42:06.073 --> 42:07.575
Jim!

42:14.615 --> 42:18.529
Grace has something she
wants to share with you,

42:18.586 --> 42:21.567
and we can use your wisdom.

42:29.563 --> 42:36.447
Daddy... l haven't
been honest with you and Mom

42:36.503 --> 42:38.574
about my dates with Jared.

42:44.211 --> 42:45.986
He's pushed our relationship

42:46.046 --> 42:51.046
to be much more physical
than I know is right.

42:56.190 --> 43:04.075
I'm sorry for hiding it
from you both.

43:04.131 --> 43:05.508
Can you forgive me'?

43:05.566 --> 43:07.239
Of course we forgive you, honey.

43:07.501 --> 43:11.950
Thank you for
being honest with us.

43:12.006 --> 43:15.044
Have you shared any
of this with Jared'?

43:15.109 --> 43:20.115
I tried but he
doesn't want to hear it.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.558
Grace, your mother and I
want to protect you

43:22.616 --> 43:24.721
from having your
heart broken again,

43:24.785 --> 43:27.698
from having any more regrets.

43:27.755 --> 43:28.733
Me too.

43:28.789 --> 43:32.601
But how'?

43:32.660 --> 43:36.938
I think the answer's been
right in front of us all along.

43:36.997 --> 43:40.206
Soybeans'?

43:40.267 --> 43:43.009
As the head of this
house it's my responsibility

43:43.070 --> 43:45.641
to help prepare you for marriage

43:45.706 --> 43:50.655
and to protect you
until that day arrives.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.817
Honey, I've been so
busy with this farm

43:53.881 --> 43:56.521
that I've failed to do that.

43:56.583 --> 44:01.032
Can you forgive me for being
so insensitive to your needs,

44:01.088 --> 44:04.831
your hopes and
dreams for the future?

44:04.892 --> 44:06.963
On Daddy!

44:07.027 --> 44:09.098
I do, I do!

44:15.336 --> 44:18.783
I'm still not quite sure
how this is going to help.

44:18.839 --> 44:20.580
Open it.

44:34.788 --> 44:38.099
And this is gonna
help me find a man... how'?

44:38.158 --> 44:39.899
You're trying to get a harvest

44:39.960 --> 44:42.804
before you've planted the seed.

44:42.863 --> 44:45.309
God has given you this
valuable time to serve others

44:45.366 --> 44:47.744
and draw closer to Him.

44:47.801 --> 44:49.974
Use it wisely!

44:50.037 --> 44:52.643
And to work on your
relationship with your brothers.

44:52.706 --> 44:57.280
Stop trying to find love,
and let God bring love to you.

44:57.344 --> 44:59.881
Dad, you're not talking about

44:59.947 --> 45:03.121
an arranged marriage, are you'?

45:03.183 --> 45:05.857
No, princess, who you marry

45:05.919 --> 45:08.661
is a decision you're going
to have to make yourself.

45:08.722 --> 45:12.295
But I'm here to help you,
to guide you,

45:12.359 --> 45:14.862
if you'll trust me.

45:19.933 --> 45:22.812
I'm still not sure
what all this means,

45:22.870 --> 45:27.216
but I'm ready to give it a try.

45:27.274 --> 45:29.254
It thrills my heart
to hear you say that.

45:33.881 --> 45:37.829
So what should
I do about Jared'?

45:37.885 --> 45:40.058
I think you already know.

46:26.867 --> 46:30.314
Grace!
Grace wait up!

46:30.370 --> 46:32.145
Whoa, whoa!

46:36.210 --> 46:38.087
Oh, hi Jared.

46:38.145 --> 46:40.091
I've been trying
to call you for days.

46:40.147 --> 46:41.353
Why haven't you been answering?

46:41.415 --> 46:43.292
We've been really busy.

46:43.350 --> 46:44.988
Hey, uh, you wanna
go to our spot'?

46:45.052 --> 46:47.896
You can tell me what it was
you wanted to talk about.

46:47.955 --> 46:50.799
No, actually,
I prefer to tell you here.

46:50.858 --> 46:51.461
Okay-

46:51.725 --> 46:52.760
What's up?

46:52.826 --> 46:53.463
I've finally figured out

46:53.727 --> 46:57.300
what's been bothering me
about our relationship.

46:57.364 --> 46:59.935
Oh'?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.002
Uh, what's that'?

47:02.069 --> 47:08.350
Jared, you and I
aren't right together.

47:08.408 --> 47:13.050
I just... l think it'd be best
if we stop seeing each other.

47:13.113 --> 47:15.059
You're kidding, right.

47:19.052 --> 47:21.293
Why?

47:21.355 --> 47:23.494
I just..l want to have
a clear conscience

47:23.757 --> 47:25.464
before the Lord and my parents,
and I don't.

47:25.526 --> 47:27.904
And I don't want to be in
an intimate relationship

47:27.961 --> 47:30.100
until I'm married.

47:30.163 --> 47:33.508
I want my life to start going
in a different direction.

47:39.306 --> 47:40.979
Good luck with that.

47:46.079 --> 47:48.753
I hope you can
respect my wishes and just...

47:48.815 --> 47:51.091
don't call or come by anymore.

47:51.151 --> 47:52.425
Fine, if that's what you want.

47:52.486 --> 47:55.330
I can play this charade.

47:55.389 --> 47:58.165
Please, don't misunderstand me.

47:58.225 --> 47:59.431
I'm through playing games.

47:59.493 --> 48:02.497
I just want real, lasting love.

48:02.563 --> 48:05.407
And I thought
that's what we had!

48:05.465 --> 48:07.274
I'm sorry, Jared!

48:30.257 --> 48:32.237
Got my work cut out
for me, don't I'?

48:34.461 --> 48:37.169
Grace.

48:37.230 --> 48:41.576
I'm sorry I messed up
your project.

48:41.835 --> 48:42.905
Forgive me'?

48:42.970 --> 48:44.278
Of course.

48:47.474 --> 48:49.283
I'm sorry for reacting
the way I did.

48:49.343 --> 48:52.347
Come here!

48:52.412 --> 48:54.915
I love you little brother.

48:56.283 --> 48:58.092
Aww, come on!

50:28.709 --> 50:30.985
Sweet dreams.

50:44.725 --> 50:46.102
Oh!

50:46.159 --> 50:47.194
I'm sorry.

50:47.260 --> 50:48.432
You all right'?

50:48.495 --> 50:49.599
Yeah. I'm fine.

50:49.663 --> 50:50.403
You sure'?

50:50.464 --> 50:51.169
Yeah.

50:51.231 --> 50:52.938
Sorry about that.

51:54.027 --> 51:56.132
Hey Grace.

51:56.196 --> 51:59.575
Grace?

51:59.633 --> 52:01.306
Hi!

52:01.368 --> 52:03.405
Hi!

52:03.470 --> 52:05.381
I'm sorry, I didn't
know I had company.

52:05.438 --> 52:06.314
Oh, that's fine.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.647
I actually came to see Drew.

52:07.707 --> 52:09.209
<i>He doing ox'?</i>

52:09.276 --> 52:11.278
Yep.
Full of energy.

52:11.344 --> 52:14.382
Good.

52:14.447 --> 52:17.291
Thank you for what
you did the other day.

52:17.350 --> 52:19.227
I was really scared.

52:19.286 --> 52:21.527
Of course.

52:21.588 --> 52:24.501
Just glad I could be there.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.504
If you're looking for Drew

52:26.560 --> 52:30.201
he might be down at the barn.

52:30.263 --> 52:33.472
Right...

52:33.533 --> 52:35.206
Thanks.

52:57.157 --> 52:59.296
Well boys, thanks to your
hard work and God's blessing,

52:59.359 --> 53:01.134
we've got us a banner crop.

53:03.230 --> 53:06.336
Only one small problem:
I can't get the combine working

53:06.399 --> 53:08.401
<i>and â€œwe pans are m backwater.</i>

53:08.468 --> 53:10.778
So, we're gonna have to do this
the old fashioned way...

53:10.837 --> 53:12.111
...by hand.

53:12.172 --> 53:13.173
Dad, that's insane.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.412
I know, I know, but, uh,

53:14.474 --> 53:16.147
I've got creditors
breathing down my neck.

53:16.209 --> 53:18.280
Isn't there some other way'?

53:18.345 --> 53:20.450
I wish there was.

53:23.650 --> 53:27.120
Tell you what: You boys
help me get this crop in,

53:27.187 --> 53:30.225
and we'll celebrate by throwing
a trapshooting competition.

53:30.290 --> 53:33.362
Hmm, hard to pass that one up...

53:33.426 --> 53:35.497
all right, I'm in.

53:35.562 --> 53:36.632
Thafsthe spirit!

53:36.696 --> 53:38.471
But Dad,
there's only three of us!

53:38.531 --> 53:41.239
Don't worry about it son,

53:41.301 --> 53:43.144
I know where to
find reinforcements.

53:46.573 --> 53:48.177
Ever worked soybeans before'?

53:48.241 --> 53:50.619
No sir, not yet.

53:50.677 --> 53:51.655
How are ya?

53:51.711 --> 53:53.122
How ya feeling buddy?

53:53.179 --> 53:53.850
Good.

54:17.771 --> 54:20.308
Thank you for being
willing to talk to me,

54:20.373 --> 54:23.183
I appreciate it.

54:23.243 --> 54:25.484
What's on your mind'?

54:25.545 --> 54:30.619
It's about your daughter.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.630
Not exactly sure
how to go about this,

54:32.686 --> 54:36.759
but I want to be clear
with my intentions up front.

54:36.823 --> 54:38.564
I'm seeking your approval

54:38.625 --> 54:41.868
to pursue a relationship
with Grace.

54:41.928 --> 54:43.339
I'd like to get
to know her better,

54:43.396 --> 54:47.708
and explore the
possibility of marriage.

54:55.241 --> 54:56.845
Clint, we uh,

54:56.910 --> 55:00.824
we appreciate you coming
to us first about this.

55:00.880 --> 55:04.259
Marriage is a serious matter.

55:04.317 --> 55:06.957
You've impressed me
as a man of integrity.

55:07.220 --> 55:10.497
And I believe you would
do things in a way

55:10.557 --> 55:14.198
that would be honorable
to both Grace and to God.

55:14.260 --> 55:18.606
So let's take this step by step,

55:18.665 --> 55:22.579
as God continues
to direct our path.

55:22.635 --> 55:25.741
Katherine and I, well,

55:25.805 --> 55:29.343
we're willing to see what God
has in store for both of you.

55:34.481 --> 55:39.362
As her father,

55:39.419 --> 55:43.925
I promised Grace that
I would watch over her,

55:43.990 --> 55:47.597
that I would protect her,

55:47.660 --> 55:54.839
that I would be a part
ofthisjourney.

55:54.901 --> 55:57.381
She's my daughter, Clint.

56:07.881 --> 56:10.259
I understand.

56:10.316 --> 56:11.989
You're a good man, Clint.

56:12.052 --> 56:13.463
Thank you sir.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.466
Thank you both!

56:35.775 --> 56:38.051
May I?

56:38.311 --> 56:42.782
So peaceful.

56:42.849 --> 56:44.886
It is.
Look...

56:55.795 --> 57:00.744
Grace, I have something
important I want to ask you.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.576
I've really enjoyed getting
to know your family

57:03.636 --> 57:08.745
over the last few months...
and getting to know you.

57:08.808 --> 57:15.418
I'd like to get
to know you better.

57:15.482 --> 57:20.830
Would you consider exploring
a deeper friendship with me?

57:20.887 --> 57:24.027
I mean, a relationship

57:24.090 --> 57:26.331
in which we'd both be
prayerfully considering

57:26.392 --> 57:31.501
the possibility... of marriage?

57:31.564 --> 57:34.670
Clint, if you had asked
me just a couple weeks ago

57:34.734 --> 57:37.544
I would have said yes
in a heartbeat

57:37.604 --> 57:40.016
but I'm determined
not to go through this

57:40.073 --> 57:42.417
without my Dad's blessing.

57:42.475 --> 57:44.614
He said, "yes."

57:44.677 --> 57:47.624
So I... wait, what'?

57:47.680 --> 57:50.786
I already spoke
with your parents.

57:50.850 --> 57:55.629
They gave us their blessing to
proceed under their guidance.

57:55.688 --> 57:59.534
Drew put you
up to this, didn't he?

57:59.592 --> 58:03.062
Grace, this isn't a joke.

58:03.129 --> 58:08.807
I think you're amazing.

58:08.868 --> 58:13.408
Your heart's too precious a
treasure to play games with.

58:18.111 --> 58:22.423
I got you something.

58:22.482 --> 58:24.928
They're beautiful.

58:24.984 --> 58:26.486
The iris symbolizes Jesus

58:26.553 --> 58:28.658
and how we need to build
our identity around him

58:28.721 --> 58:30.894
to be truly satisfied.

58:30.957 --> 58:32.095
And the roses represent

58:32.158 --> 58:37.107
the need for purity
in our relationship.

58:37.163 --> 58:38.972
Grace, I want to treat you
with the honor and respect

58:39.032 --> 58:41.137
that you're due,

58:41.201 --> 58:44.114
so that even if the Lord doesn't
bring us together in marriage,

58:44.170 --> 58:49.779
we can remain friends.

58:49.842 --> 58:53.085
I'd be honored to explore
that possibility with you.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.718
Spin... go for
the magic number... Yes!

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.054
No way!

01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:14.929
1...2... 3... 4...
Retire in style.

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:16.057
Who's the winner at Life'?

01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:17.157
This guy!

01:01:17.223 --> 01:01:18.600
Ok, come on!

01:01:18.658 --> 01:01:20.296
I'd like to see you really try.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.236
That's okay.

01:01:21.294 --> 01:01:22.102
I won.

01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:23.572
Game over.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.608
All of this... mine.

01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:36.846
You double crosser.

01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:38.786
Whoa, wait!

01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:41.787
What are you talking about?

01:01:41.848 --> 01:01:43.589
I thought you were
waiting on God.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:44.684
I am.

01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.958
So then what are
you doing with my guy'?

01:01:47.019 --> 01:01:48.726
Who?

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:52.964
The guy from the
coffee shop, who else'?

01:01:53.025 --> 01:01:54.595
Clint?

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.833
Ok, Wow.

01:01:56.896 --> 01:01:58.204
I know what you're thinking.

01:01:58.264 --> 01:02:01.245
Honestly, I didn't know
that he was 'that guy.'

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.677
So then prove it.

01:02:02.735 --> 01:02:04.043
Break up with him.

01:02:04.103 --> 01:02:05.605
Break up with him or I'll...

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.651
I will never speak to you again!

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:08.879
Tessa, that's not fair!

01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:11.012
Just calm down
and let me explain.

01:02:11.077 --> 01:02:13.717
Clint and I are just friends,
and we're explore...

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.886
Call it what you want,
you stole my guy.

01:02:16.949 --> 01:02:19.190
So what's it gonna be?

01:02:19.252 --> 01:02:22.290
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:02:22.355 --> 01:02:25.097
Just come inside and
let's talk about it.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.661
So that's how
it's gonna be, huh'?

01:02:27.727 --> 01:02:30.037
Some friend you are.

01:02:30.096 --> 01:02:31.700
Tessa!

01:02:46.312 --> 01:02:48.349
Oh, hey, Excuse me.

01:02:48.414 --> 01:02:49.825
Ma km?

01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:52.658
Yes, can I help you, Dear'?

01:02:52.718 --> 01:02:53.822
Yes, hi, I was wondering...

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:55.763
I'm looking for a
friend of mine...

01:02:55.822 --> 01:02:57.267
Clint Masters.

01:02:57.323 --> 01:02:58.427
Do you know him'?

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.695
Isn't that the new doctor
in East Bend'?

01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:03.001
East Bend, you say'?

01:03:03.062 --> 01:03:05.042
Yes, down that way, not far.

01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:08.078
If you go down
to the first turn,

01:03:08.134 --> 01:03:09.204
and you'll take a left,

01:03:09.268 --> 01:03:11.111
there at the old
Hirschman place, you know,

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.912
and then a few miles on down
you'll see the church

01:03:13.973 --> 01:03:15.782
and you'll know
you're close that way.

01:03:15.842 --> 01:03:17.981
Don't blink or you'll miss it.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.182
Thanks.

01:03:19.245 --> 01:03:22.158
I hear he's renovating
the old Bates Farm.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.161
You plan to be around long'?

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.027
Not if I can help it.
Bye!

01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:41.844
She thought Clint was hers'?

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.745
I tried to explain
that Clint wasn't mine either,

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:46.374
but she wouldn't hear me out.

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:48.783
We all have our blind side.

01:03:50.843 --> 01:03:53.483
Another friendship
bites the dust.

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.282
Don't give up on her.

01:03:55.348 --> 01:03:57.760
Maybe in time
she'll come around.

01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:06.192
Mmm! Sweet smell
of success.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:07.897
And I know why.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.430
Shh, don't give
away our family secrets!

01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:20.741
I wonder who that is'?

01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:27.279
Looking for someone'?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.384
Looking for someone'?

01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:31.087
Clint Masters'?

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:33.790
I believe he bought
some property around here.

01:04:33.853 --> 01:04:34.763
Oh, are you related?

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.525
No.

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:37.233
Not yet, anyway-

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.963
He lives the next farm over.

01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:41.505
Grace can show you
if you'd like.

01:04:41.561 --> 01:04:44.405
That's okay,
I can manage, thanks.

01:04:49.535 --> 01:04:52.106
Wait, there he is now.

01:04:59.845 --> 01:05:01.153
Any luck finding a combine'?

01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:02.351
Another dead end.

01:05:02.415 --> 01:05:04.520
This young lady's
looking for Clint.

01:05:04.584 --> 01:05:07.929
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name...

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.227
Brooke??

01:05:09.288 --> 01:05:12.997
Hello stranger.

01:05:13.059 --> 01:05:14.868
What are you doing here'?

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:19.433
Well, I... l could
ask you the same thing.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:27.541
I see some of
you have already met.

01:05:27.607 --> 01:05:29.052
Mr. Anderson,
this is Brooke,

01:05:29.108 --> 01:05:30.212
a friend of mine from back home.

01:05:30.276 --> 01:05:31.949
Nice to meet you.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:35.220
Any friend of Clint's
is a friend of ours.

01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:39.286
I was hoping you could
recommend a place to stay.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.592
Is there anything close by?

01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:42.526
You must be very tired.

01:05:42.588 --> 01:05:45.000
You can stay with us.

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:48.436
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:50.064
L...l don't want to impose...

01:05:50.129 --> 01:05:51.836
It's not a problem.

01:05:51.897 --> 01:05:54.070
Do you have some luggage'?

01:05:54.133 --> 01:05:55.976
Sure, thanks.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.173
Robert, why don't you
help her with the luggage.

01:05:57.236 --> 01:05:58.408
Can I have
your keys real quick'?

01:05:58.471 --> 01:05:59.950
Thank you.

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:06.556
Um, guess I'll help
with the luggage.

01:06:20.593 --> 01:06:22.197
So, where are you from'?

01:06:22.261 --> 01:06:24.036
Colorado.

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:32.576
I've heard that's
a beautiful state.

01:06:32.638 --> 01:06:34.345
Yeah, it is.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.499
How do you know Clint?

01:06:52.558 --> 01:06:57.632
Oh, uh, we grew up together
and dated all through college.

01:06:57.697 --> 01:06:58.675
Really?

01:06:58.931 --> 01:06:59.909
Mhm.

01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:02.605
Then his parents wanted him
to go off to med school

01:07:02.668 --> 01:07:08.584
and that was it...
he practicallyjust disappeared.

01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:10.643
I knew someone
that went away to college

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:13.384
and came back a
completely different person.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:14.288
Yeah'?

01:07:14.346 --> 01:07:16.121
Well we're both grown up now.

01:07:16.182 --> 01:07:19.220
And him a doctor too!

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:22.095
I can't wait to catch up.

01:07:26.992 --> 01:07:32.271
So... how is it
that you know Clint?

01:07:32.331 --> 01:07:34.242
Uhhh...

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.281
Grace, can you please
give me a hand in the kitchen?

01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:38.679
Be right there.

01:07:38.738 --> 01:07:40.479
Wouldn't a restaurant be easier?

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:42.212
Welcome to East Bend.

01:07:59.725 --> 01:08:02.433
That's a lot of beans!

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.601
God gave me two hands,
and I intend to use 'em.

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:09.134
Not gonna let a broken
combine slow me down!

01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:10.612
My father says,

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:13.616
"Duties are ours
and results are God's."

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:15.709
Your father's a wise man.

01:08:15.775 --> 01:08:18.688
So you and Robert
will start over here,

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:22.624
I'll work up the middle and
the women can start over here.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.661
How long do
you think it'll take'?

01:08:24.716 --> 01:08:27.459
If the weather holds,
and we work fast,

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.557
two weeks, maybe three.

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:32.125
Sounds like a workable plan.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.033
Great!

01:08:34.093 --> 01:08:39.270
Now tell me about Brooke.

01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:45.111
Mr. Anderson, Brooke and I used
to be in a relationship.

01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.774
Everyone expected us
to get married.

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:50.747
I even had the ring.

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:54.279
It just wasn't right though.

01:08:54.345 --> 01:08:58.020
Neither one of us had
our priorities straight.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:08:59.288
My parents encouraged me

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:02.354
tojust be patient
and wait on God's timing.

01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:04.627
So I broke it off with her
and I buried the ring.

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:06.430
Yet here she is.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:12.808
I'm really sorry.

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:15.511
I didn't want Grace to
get a surprise like this.

01:09:19.438 --> 01:09:22.715
I believe you Clint.

01:09:22.774 --> 01:09:25.051
Thank you.

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:27.647
But I will not
have Grace getting hurt.

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:30.626
So I'm counting on God to
show you how to handle this.

01:09:30.683 --> 01:09:32.390
Yes sir.

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:34.089
Good.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.827
LeFS Pray-

01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:41.332
Lord, thank you
for your providence

01:09:41.393 --> 01:09:44.067
which has brought Brooke
and Clint to our table tonight.

01:09:44.129 --> 01:09:46.631
May all of these young people
seated here look to your Word

01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:50.408
for guidance and
direction in their life.

01:09:50.469 --> 01:09:52.470
We ask your blessing
for this food now

01:09:52.537 --> 01:09:54.211
and for those
that have prepared it.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.344
In Jesus' Name
we praise you, Amen.

01:10:00.846 --> 01:10:02.587
Clint, you remember
we used to make

01:10:02.648 --> 01:10:05.094
cornbread growing up?

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.128
I do.

01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:16.331
Cornbread'?

01:10:16.395 --> 01:10:17.373
Your favorite.

01:10:17.429 --> 01:10:18.635
Ah, looks great.

01:10:18.697 --> 01:10:20.233
Yeah, I think I'll
have some cornbread.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:21.607
This looks delicious.

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:22.737
Who made the cornbread'?

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:23.643
Grace.

01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:26.239
I helped out!

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.784
She's a very fine cook.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.875
She is a fine cook.

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:29.846
She's got a great teacher.

01:10:29.909 --> 01:10:31.320
We teach them well.

01:10:31.377 --> 01:10:35.257
Lock that front
window over there.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.625
Were you guys playing in the
yard today or this afternoon.

01:10:40.419 --> 01:10:43.764
So Clint, how do you
like being a doctor'?

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:45.859
I like it.

01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:47.563
How's that going?

01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:49.697
It's going great.

01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:51.639
I'm liking it here in East Bend.

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:52.801
That's wonderful!

01:10:52.865 --> 01:10:54.776
We're happy to have you.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:56.403
Quiet here.

01:10:56.468 --> 01:11:00.416
Hard-working people.

01:11:00.472 --> 01:11:02.315
So what brings you
to North Carolina?

01:11:02.374 --> 01:11:07.448
Oh... L0oking
for something I lost.

01:11:15.487 --> 01:11:18.434
Well gang, I'm happy to
announce that the crop is ready.

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.527
And Clint has agreed
to take the week off

01:11:20.592 --> 01:11:22.833
to help with the harvest.

01:11:22.895 --> 01:11:24.875
That's very kind of you, doctor.

01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:30.539
And as an added incentive,
if we get it in on time,

01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:32.240
I would like to host
a Harvest Festival.

01:11:32.304 --> 01:11:33.214
Yes!

01:11:35.741 --> 01:11:37.914
What is a Harvest Festival?

01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:39.183
We invite the community

01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:41.349
to come and share a
bountiful feast with us

01:11:41.413 --> 01:11:43.256
in celebration of our harvest.

01:11:43.315 --> 01:11:44.259
Oh!

01:11:44.316 --> 01:11:45.727
So you give it all away'?

01:11:45.784 --> 01:11:47.195
Not all of it.

01:11:47.252 --> 01:11:49.892
But if God has blessed us
with so much,

01:11:49.955 --> 01:11:52.196
we should use it
to bless others.

01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:55.336
What a strange idea.

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.682
I'm sorry to have to do this,

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.514
but I really should get going.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.815
Thank you so much for dinner,
that was fantastic.

01:12:10.876 --> 01:12:12.719
Um...

01:12:19.485 --> 01:12:20.862
Yeah, well,
I know it's not a sports car,

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:24.833
but I have complete
confidence in you.

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:28.633
Thanks, Mike, I really
appreciate this.

01:12:28.694 --> 01:12:30.605
Alright, talk to you soon.

01:12:30.662 --> 01:12:32.471
Clint!

01:12:32.531 --> 01:12:36.877
[footsteps

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:39.643
You leaving so soon'?

01:12:39.705 --> 01:12:42.811
I thought we could catch up?

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:46.413
Brooke...

01:12:46.478 --> 01:12:48.515
Things have changed.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.651
I've changed.

01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:52.491
Yeah'?

01:12:52.551 --> 01:12:56.328
I've changed too.

01:12:56.388 --> 01:13:00.029
But I still miss you.

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:03.398
I need you to understand.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:07.308
I'm beginning a
new relationship.

01:13:07.366 --> 01:13:10.643
I'm trying to do things
the right way.

01:13:10.702 --> 01:13:12.375
The right way'?

01:13:12.438 --> 01:13:15.851
Am I the wrong way'?

01:13:15.908 --> 01:13:19.321
That's not what I meant.

01:13:19.378 --> 01:13:23.554
I'm sorry... l need to go.

01:13:59.118 --> 01:14:00.825
How you ladies
faring over there?

01:14:00.886 --> 01:14:02.365
We'll make it.

01:14:02.421 --> 01:14:05.027
I'll get the hang
of it by the time we're done.

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:29.655
Hey Dad!

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.126
Look!

01:14:34.853 --> 01:14:36.594
Would you look at that.

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:44.396
Sweet!

01:14:45.964 --> 01:14:47.136
Wppeel!

01:14:55.707 --> 01:14:57.709
Clint!

01:14:57.776 --> 01:15:01.883
Clint!

01:15:01.947 --> 01:15:03.153
Clint!

01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:15.170
How'd you get it running'?

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:16.929
My buddy Mike works
wonders with engines,

01:15:16.995 --> 01:15:18.668
so I asked him
to give it a shot.

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.575
All yours.

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:24.875
Looks like we're gonna
have an early Harvest Festival!

01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:01.974
I know you probably

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.611
weren't expecting
to see me here, but...

01:16:04.676 --> 01:16:07.623
I blew things out of proportion
the other night with Clint.

01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:09.488
I'm sorry.

01:16:09.548 --> 01:16:13.553
Seems this misunderstanding
was my fault too.

01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:15.462
Forgive me'?

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.464
Of course.

01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:18.831
Clint just better
have a brother.

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:22.589
Let me tell you about my Hog.

01:17:22.654 --> 01:17:24.133
You're gonna like this.

01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:25.133
Here it is...

01:17:32.698 --> 01:17:35.304
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Can I have your attention?

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:36.910
Thank you.

01:17:36.968 --> 01:17:40.245
Thank you so much for coming
to our Harvest Celebration.

01:17:40.305 --> 01:17:41.784
Katherine and I,

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.979
we really hope you
have a great time today.

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:46.682
And for anyone who's interested,

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:49.055
if you'll start making your way
over to the sporting clays area

01:17:49.114 --> 01:17:50.991
we'll start that
trapshooting competition

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.119
in just a few minutes.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.234
Come on, sis,

01:18:06.298 --> 01:18:08.676
you don't want to miss my
expert shooting, do ya?

01:18:08.734 --> 01:18:09.678
I can't.

01:18:09.735 --> 01:18:10.907
I need to stay here
and help out.

01:18:10.969 --> 01:18:12.812
Go on, I can handle this.

01:18:12.871 --> 01:18:14.248
Are you sure'?

01:18:14.306 --> 01:18:15.751
Oh yeah.

01:18:15.807 --> 01:18:16.911
Okay-

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:42.269
Pull!

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:51.376
Pull!

01:19:01.219 --> 01:19:02.220
Pull!

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.038
Pull!

01:19:29.114 --> 01:19:30.354
How'd you learn
to shoot like that'?

01:19:30.415 --> 01:19:32.088
I guess living in
the country has its perks.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.830
Pull!

01:19:43.128 --> 01:19:44.436
Clint? Clint!

01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:45.674
Can you help me'?

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.004
My gun is jammed.

01:19:47.065 --> 01:19:48.100
I'd love some pointers.

01:19:48.166 --> 01:19:49.839
Whoa, let me help
you with that Brooke.

01:19:55.407 --> 01:19:56.750
There you go.

01:19:56.808 --> 01:19:57.809
You know what'?

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:58.980
L...l need a break.

01:20:10.188 --> 01:20:12.134
Hey, who's that guy'?

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:15.364
L...can't...
get a good look at him!

01:20:15.427 --> 01:20:16.997
Here, try these.

01:20:22.334 --> 01:20:24.473
Intruder alert!
Sergeant, man the guns!

01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:44.391
Well, who do we have here'?

01:20:44.456 --> 01:20:46.129
Who's asking?

01:20:46.191 --> 01:20:49.172
Jared Cunningham
at your service.

01:20:51.796 --> 01:20:53.434
So where you from, gorgeous?

01:20:53.498 --> 01:20:54.977
Out West.

01:20:55.033 --> 01:20:57.138
Shoulda guessed.

01:20:57.202 --> 01:21:00.979
There's not any girls half as
pretty as you are around here.

01:21:01.039 --> 01:21:05.920
There's not as many guys
half as smart to notice.

01:21:05.977 --> 01:21:10.323
So what brings you out here'?

01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:15.764
My fiance', Clint.

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:18.027
You don't say...

01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:25.337
Come on,
wanna go have some fun'?

01:21:25.397 --> 01:21:27.104
Let's go... come with me.

01:21:33.538 --> 01:21:34.881
Pull!

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:52.324
How'd you learn
to shoot like that'?

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:54.836
I've shot a time or two.

01:21:54.893 --> 01:21:58.466
You know, if you want me to,
I can give you a few pointers.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.937
L, uh, I hate to interrupt,

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:07.313
but your dad wants something
in the..in the shop.

01:22:07.372 --> 01:22:08.476
Thanks.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.247
Sorry.

01:22:18.483 --> 01:22:19.962
So you were shooting
really good!

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:20.860
Thank you.

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:23.593
I move on to the final round,
that's fortunate.

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:24.458
Good!

01:22:26.524 --> 01:22:28.162
Dad?

01:22:28.226 --> 01:22:31.537
Quite the party
you got going on.

01:22:31.596 --> 01:22:32.973
Jared!

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.840
What are you doing here'?

01:22:34.899 --> 01:22:37.004
Just thought I'd
check and see how that, uh,

01:22:37.068 --> 01:22:39.105
how that like "new direction"
was going for ya.

01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:40.376
That's none of your business.

01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:42.179
Hey, wait!

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.548
I wanted to show you something.

01:22:48.313 --> 01:22:50.554
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

01:22:50.615 --> 01:22:52.959
It matches the earrings
I got ya.

01:22:53.018 --> 01:22:53.962
Look.

01:22:57.889 --> 01:23:01.427
It's beautiful,
but I can't accept it.

01:23:01.493 --> 01:23:03.234
Ok, So we went
a little too fast.

01:23:03.294 --> 01:23:05.900
Okay, but we can start
over, we can try again.

01:23:05.964 --> 01:23:10.208
That's not the
kind of love I want.

01:23:10.268 --> 01:23:12.248
All you care about is yourself.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:22.653
How ya doing'?

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:24.154
Good to see you again.

01:23:24.215 --> 01:23:25.523
That was some great
shooting today...

01:23:31.389 --> 01:23:32.459
Clint, wait!

01:23:32.524 --> 01:23:35.994
Would you please stop!

01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:37.540
Just go home!

01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:39.472
I didn't wait all this time

01:23:39.531 --> 01:23:41.306
for some
good-for-nothing farm girl

01:23:41.366 --> 01:23:43.607
to come between us!

01:23:43.668 --> 01:23:46.547
There is no more us, Brooke.

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:47.981
Excuse me.

01:23:50.408 --> 01:23:52.479
Clint!

01:23:52.544 --> 01:23:54.649
Excuse me.

01:23:54.713 --> 01:23:57.250
That doctor's not gonna
work out for you anyway.

01:23:57.315 --> 01:23:59.192
He likes that Brooke girl.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:00.627
That was a long time ago!

01:24:00.685 --> 01:24:02.961
Well, then why is she here now'?

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:07.629
We're done here.

01:24:07.692 --> 01:24:09.399
Let go of me!

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.405
I'm not done!

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:12.339
Hey! Leave her alone.

01:24:12.397 --> 01:24:14.434
You okay'?

01:24:14.499 --> 01:24:16.501
How romantic!

01:24:16.568 --> 01:24:19.606
So... so this is
the hero you left me for?

01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:22.652
Mr. Nice Guy'?

01:24:22.707 --> 01:24:23.481
Look out!

01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:28.615
<i>Mm!</i>

01:24:41.526 --> 01:24:44.132
That's enough!

01:24:44.195 --> 01:24:45.139
It's time for you to go!

01:24:45.196 --> 01:24:47.005
Let me go!

01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:55.074
When that new
direction doesn't pan out,

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.380
you'll be coming back.

01:24:56.441 --> 01:24:58.546
There is nothing
for you here, ever.

01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:00.681
Now get off my property!

01:25:03.148 --> 01:25:04.650
You pack your bags, missy,

01:25:04.716 --> 01:25:07.060
you've overstayed
your welcome too.

01:25:07.118 --> 01:25:09.758
I'm not leaving
until I get what I came for.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.261
Let's go.

01:25:14.325 --> 01:25:18.432
You've done enough damage here.

01:25:18.496 --> 01:25:21.238
On second thought,

01:25:21.299 --> 01:25:24.075
home sounds really
good about now.

01:25:29.407 --> 01:25:34.015
I wanted to
handle this differently.

01:25:34.078 --> 01:25:35.352
I'm sorry.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.641
You pass the pancakes, please?

01:25:53.698 --> 01:25:55.769
Sure.

01:25:55.834 --> 01:25:58.144
Thank you.

01:25:58.203 --> 01:26:00.706
You shoulda seen
the look on Jared's face

01:26:00.772 --> 01:26:02.217
when Kenny and I shot him.

01:26:08.546 --> 01:26:12.187
I wonder why Clint
had to leave so suddenly?

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:15.060
Things don't always
work out as planned.

01:26:15.119 --> 01:26:17.224
I know he had some stuff
to take care of.

01:26:17.288 --> 01:26:21.703
Then why did God let
Brooke come and ruin everything'?

01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:23.739
I can't answer that sweetheart,

01:26:23.795 --> 01:26:26.275
but I do know that you
can still trust Him.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.409
You should write him.

01:26:30.468 --> 01:26:33.312
And be thankful for
what you do have.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:47.093
Dear Clint: I don't know
where you are tonight

01:26:47.151 --> 01:26:48.494
or what you're doing...

01:26:48.553 --> 01:26:50.328
...but I never
got to thank you

01:26:50.388 --> 01:26:52.732
for defending me last week.

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:56.499
I respect you for being
a man of principle...

01:26:56.561 --> 01:26:59.167
...You've taught me
to cherish and value

01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:03.372
my parent's blessing,
to wait for God's timing...

01:27:03.434 --> 01:27:06.847
...and above all,
to be satisfied in Christ,

01:27:06.905 --> 01:27:08.748
whether He brings us
together or not.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:16.257
Thank you for being
a true friend.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.885
Sincerely, Grace.

01:27:27.425 --> 01:27:29.336
Sweetheart, you about ready'?

01:27:29.394 --> 01:27:31.203
Be there in a second!

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:37.870
Missed a spot.

01:27:41.806 --> 01:27:45.652
What a lovely young woman
you've become.

01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:49.248
I'm very proud of you.

01:27:49.314 --> 01:27:51.419
What makes you say that'?

01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:06.337
There you are, Princess!

01:28:06.397 --> 01:28:08.308
Ready for our
mountain excursion'?

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:09.504
Can't wait!

01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:30.297
Yeah.

01:28:30.355 --> 01:28:31.766
Everything's ready.

01:28:38.463 --> 01:28:39.635
"Lime to eat guys.

01:28:44.502 --> 01:28:46.675
Dogs, and pies,
and all the goodies here.

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:48.445
Oh man, I'm gonna sit over here.

01:28:48.506 --> 01:28:49.917
Why don't you go find Grace?

01:28:49.974 --> 01:28:51.214
Can you do that'?

01:28:51.275 --> 01:28:52.618
That'd be good.

01:29:01.352 --> 01:29:03.764
It's beautiful, isn't it'?

01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:05.300
Clint'?!

01:29:05.356 --> 01:29:06.460
I thought you were...

01:29:06.524 --> 01:29:09.266
I...l had
to take care of her.

01:29:09.327 --> 01:29:11.773
That's not why I went back.

01:29:11.829 --> 01:29:14.241
I can't believe you're here.

01:29:14.298 --> 01:29:15.902
How did you even know
where we were'?

01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:19.915
I planned this
whole thing with your dad.

01:29:19.971 --> 01:29:25.478
Actually... l believe God
planned this love story.

01:29:25.543 --> 01:29:27.989
When He brought me to East Bend,

01:29:28.046 --> 01:29:32.722
I couldn't have imagined the
blessings He had in store.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:40.828
I came for a job,
and discovered a loving family.

01:29:40.892 --> 01:29:43.668
I put romance on hold, Grace.

01:29:43.728 --> 01:29:45.469
I was waiting on Him

01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:54.041
to bring a woman with
character and conviction.

01:29:54.305 --> 01:29:56.307
Guess that's settled.

01:30:03.081 --> 01:30:05.425
Grace Anderson,

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:09.431
I've grown to cherish you
over the last few months.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:13.025
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.
