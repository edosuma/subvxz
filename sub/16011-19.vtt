[phone beeping]

02:01.440 --> 02:02.760
Well, let's get ready

02:02.761 --> 02:04.080
to smash another watermelon

02:04.120 --> 02:05.520
that I carried up all

02:05.521 --> 02:06.920
by myself... Violetta.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.280
- I can't believe
- I got stuck doing this stupid...

02:09.320 --> 02:11.280
- "science" experiment
- with you.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.640
Can we just get this over with?

02:12.680 --> 02:13.920
We could have finished this

02:13.960 --> 02:15.440
a week ago, like I wanted to!

02:15.480 --> 02:17.040
Now listen:

02:17.080 --> 02:18.120
I'll drop one egg

02:18.121 --> 02:19.160
and one watermelon.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.776
- All you have to do
- is take a picture of them

02:20.800 --> 02:22.336
- Hitting the ground
- at the same time.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
Listen, dork,

02:23.361 --> 02:24.361
if you get any egg

02:24.400 --> 02:25.600
on my designer shoes,

02:25.640 --> 02:26.800
you'll hear from my lawyer!

02:26.840 --> 02:28.240
[Mia] Just pay attention!

02:28.280 --> 02:29.760
- Our science grade
- depends on this!

02:31.160 --> 02:32.840
I'm not really friends with her.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.920
It was a random draw, I swear!

02:34.960 --> 02:36.240
You get all that?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.880
Bombs away!

02:46.120 --> 02:47.760

- Yup...

02:55.280 --> 02:56.800
Hey, watch it!

02:56.840 --> 02:58.560
- This outfit is worth
- more than you!

03:00.080 --> 03:02.120
[Violetta] Hey! Get back here!

03:03.840 --> 03:06.040
Is that egg yolk on my shoe?!

03:09.320 --> 03:10.800
- [sighs]
- Now, listen.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.200
- You don't like me...
- True.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.880
And I don't like you.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.416
- But we are gonna
- have to work together on this,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.016
- Or we both gonna
- fail this assignment.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.560
You don't want to fail, do you?

03:18.600 --> 03:19.960
I told you before.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.320
I've got it covered.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.560
What's that supposed to mean?

03:24.280 --> 03:25.896
- Just be happy
- you got paired with someone

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
With my resourcefulness

03:26.921 --> 03:27.921
and ingenuity.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.840
You worry too much.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.600
Stress gives you acne.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.080
Why do I have a sinking feeling

03:34.081 --> 03:35.520
about this?

03:35.560 --> 03:37.160
See you in class, "partner."

03:37.200 --> 03:38.760
And I know you don't expect me

03:38.800 --> 03:40.040
to help clean up that mess.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.800
That is so unfair of Violetta.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.520
- I can't believe
- she actually made you

03:52.560 --> 03:54.060
Prove the law of falling bodies

03:54.061 --> 03:55.560
by yourself.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.200
I know, especially considering

03:57.240 --> 03:59.320
- she waited till the last minute
- to blow it off.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.860
[sighs] I don't think an "A"

04:00.861 --> 04:02.360
is in the cards.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.760
[sighs]

04:16.279 --> 04:17.480
[Violetta] Niiiice job.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.720
What's that?

04:23.560 --> 04:25.240
- [Violetta] It's our physics
- project.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.960
I told you to trust me!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.040
There's no way

04:30.041 --> 04:31.080
you did that by yourself.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.320
And in so little time.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.960
Uh, duh!

04:35.520 --> 04:36.800
We can't do that!

04:36.840 --> 04:38.720
I should turn you in!

04:38.760 --> 04:40.680
- [sighs] It'll be my word
- against yours.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.320
Do you know how much my daddy

04:42.360 --> 04:44.280
- donates to this school's
- science department?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.000
It just doesn't feel right.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.220
What did I say

04:48.221 --> 04:49.400
about worrying too much?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.960
Right. I'll be right back.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.120
Acne cream.

04:58.121 --> 04:59.240
I'm sure you'd understand.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.520
I think I've got it.

That was better than last time.

Huh!

Hey, Onchao!

[neighs]

06:00.680 --> 06:01.880
Yuko gave them to you?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.280
To block the annoying music?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.880
What annoying music?

06:04.920 --> 06:07.360
[discordant music playing]

06:11.920 --> 06:13.320
Oh. Sorry.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.560

[louder] Better?!

06:16.720 --> 06:17.960
[snorts]

06:18.000 --> 06:20.200
I'm not even sure it's music.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.280
Where's it coming from?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.920
Phuddle. I might have known.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.040
[Yuko] Mia!

06:26.080 --> 06:28.000
Hey, guys.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.680
What's Phuddle doing up there?!

06:29.720 --> 06:31.120
Whatever it is,

06:31.121 --> 06:32.520
it's been going on for hours,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.000
and I've had about enough of it.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.360
I need those back.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.880
- It doesn't matter.
- He's going to have to stop.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.440
Come on.

What? I'm trying to be polite.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.480
Don't encourage him.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.800
[Phuddle] What'd you think?!

07:10.840 --> 07:12.200
Pretty sweet, eh?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.320
For the first minute or so.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.680
You don't get it!

Well the Unichordian

07:24.261 --> 07:25.760
is built to attract unicorns!

07:25.800 --> 07:27.060

07:27.061 --> 07:28.320

08:34.360 --> 08:36.799
Okay, that's one problem solved.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.600
So... did you bring the oracle?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.080
Just find the closest ravine.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.880
- I'll tell you the oracle
- on the way.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.360
Humph. I'll show those Elves.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.320
What do they know anyway?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.120
- I'll play the Unichordian
- in the woods

08:51.160 --> 08:52.800
And attract every unicorn

08:52.801 --> 08:54.440
in Centopia!

08:54.480 --> 08:56.200
- There'll be
- so much unicorn dust,

08:56.240 --> 08:57.500
The Elves won't know

08:57.501 --> 08:58.760
what to do with it all!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.240
Hmm. Steep hill.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.080
Now where'd I put those brakes?

09:05.120 --> 09:07.680
Ah, there they are.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.760
This is definitely a ravine.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.040
Is Onchao sure it's this ravine?

09:29.080 --> 09:30.520
Anything Onchao?

- [neighs]

09:31.961 --> 09:33.360

- Wow!

- Every one of them
- looks better than the last.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.880
Nice work, Phuddle!

10:35.920 --> 10:37.440
It may not attract unicorns,

10:37.480 --> 10:38.880
but it's pretty good at

10:38.920 --> 10:40.480
- digging up
- pieces of the Trumptus!

10:40.520 --> 10:42.040
[snorts]

[gasps]

12:13.720 --> 12:14.760
[grunts]

12:16.240 --> 12:17.880
Stay under cover!

12:17.920 --> 12:19.040
Oh no!

12:19.080 --> 12:20.120
[grunts]

12:22.760 --> 12:23.920
Mo!

12:23.960 --> 12:25.040
Yuko!

12:36.120 --> 12:38.440
Where are those blasted scouts?!

12:38.480 --> 12:39.720
Gargona!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.840
Yes my Queen, sorry my Queen!

12:41.880 --> 12:43.520
Well? Where did they go?!

12:43.560 --> 12:44.880
I don't know.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.360
We've had scouts late before,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.040
but not this many at once.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.720
Ugh! Probably the elves' doing.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.680
- They're always
- shrinking your troops,

12:52.720 --> 12:54.640
Making an utter fool of you.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.960
- I've half a mind
- to banish them from the island.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.496
- [to herself] If you had
- the other half

12:58.520 --> 13:00.120
- We'd rule Centopia
- by now.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
What did you say?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.200
I was only commenting on

13:03.240 --> 13:04.340
how sparkly

13:04.341 --> 13:05.440
your mask looks today!

13:05.480 --> 13:07.200
Have you polished it?

13:07.240 --> 13:08.280
[shrieking]

13:09.400 --> 13:11.560
Ah, there they are...

13:13.880 --> 13:15.200
They've got...

13:15.240 --> 13:17.240
Prisoners! Elves!

13:17.280 --> 13:18.880
[Panthea] This is turning into

13:18.881 --> 13:20.480
a good day after all!

13:24.480 --> 13:25.620
Well, well...

13:25.621 --> 13:26.760
the Elf prince and...

13:26.800 --> 13:28.260
some other elf

13:28.261 --> 13:29.720
who looks vaguely familiar.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.120
Uugh!

13:31.160 --> 13:32.360
Take their weapons

13:32.400 --> 13:34.160
and throw them in the cage!

13:35.000 --> 13:36.640
Agh!

13:36.680 --> 13:37.880
Ugh!

13:41.280 --> 13:42.760
[grunts]

13:42.800 --> 13:43.920
Let me go,

13:43.921 --> 13:45.040
you brainless zombies!

13:52.280 --> 13:53.440
[laughs]

13:57.040 --> 13:59.440
Hey! That's mine! Give it back!

13:59.480 --> 14:00.840
Aaah! Uh!

14:00.880 --> 14:02.160
Woo!

14:08.120 --> 14:09.180
King Raynor

14:09.181 --> 14:10.240
should pay handsomely

14:10.280 --> 14:11.960
for these two.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.560
Perhaps an exchange

14:13.561 --> 14:15.120
for the little unicorn

14:15.160 --> 14:17.600
I've heard so much about.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.040
[cackles]

14:19.080 --> 14:20.760
Stop cackling!

14:20.800 --> 14:22.160
I'm supposed to do that!

14:22.200 --> 14:24.040
[cackles]

14:26.400 --> 14:28.000
[Mia] Phuddle?

14:28.040 --> 14:29.640
You can come out now.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.880
Oh no.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.680
This is all my fault!

14:35.480 --> 14:36.760
[crying] Stupid

14:36.761 --> 14:38.040
unicorn-repelling,

14:38.080 --> 14:40.920
munc-attracting piece of junk!

14:40.960 --> 14:43.520
[rattling]

14:43.560 --> 14:44.840
You just gave me an idea,

14:44.880 --> 14:46.560
- Phuddle!
- I did?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.680
- If the muncs like this thing
- so much,

14:48.720 --> 14:50.320
- What do you say
- we give it to them?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.720
What? Give away

14:51.721 --> 14:53.080
my precious Unichordian?

14:53.120 --> 14:54.180
- I don't mean literally.

14:54.181 --> 14:55.240
- Phew.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.400
You had me going there

14:56.401 --> 14:57.520
for a second.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.040
Turn this...

14:59.041 --> 15:00.520
thing on and follow me!

15:01.440 --> 15:02.840
With pleasure!

15:02.880 --> 15:04.120
[Unichordian rattles]

15:04.160 --> 15:05.680
Mhmm... just listen to the...

15:05.720 --> 15:06.760
[mumbling to himself]

15:30.880 --> 15:32.800
Are you okay Phuddle?

15:32.840 --> 15:35.160
Oh yeah, just dandy!

15:35.200 --> 15:36.300
Never been better!

15:36.301 --> 15:37.400
[chuckles nervously]

15:37.440 --> 15:38.820
[to himself] How did I let

15:38.821 --> 15:40.200
myself get talked into this?

15:46.960 --> 15:48.360
This is as far as we can go

15:48.361 --> 15:49.760
without getting into the vapors.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.600
Now for the hard part.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.400
Onchao, come over here!

15:55.440 --> 15:56.920
You hide in those rocks.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.560
- Don't come out
- unless you hear us.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.240
If we're not back by sundown,

16:00.280 --> 16:01.896
- fly back to the elves
- and get help, okay?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.480
[snorts]

16:03.520 --> 16:05.280
Okay! Let's do this!

16:06.720 --> 16:08.280
Take it away, Phuddle!

- [whispering] What's Phuddle
- trying to do?

16:23.520 --> 16:25.080
I don't know! But I wish

16:25.120 --> 16:26.740
I had some of those earmuffs

16:26.741 --> 16:28.360
right now!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.480
[Panthea] What... is that?

16:32.480 --> 16:35.920
So beautiful...

16:35.960 --> 16:38.240
Such lovely music.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.520
I must have it!

16:40.560 --> 16:41.780
Gargona,

16:41.781 --> 16:43.000
whatever's making that sound,

16:43.040 --> 16:45.320
bring it to me, immediately!

16:45.360 --> 16:47.000
[Gargona] Of course, my Queen!

thing... is,

16:58.280 --> 17:00.560
it belongs to Panthea now!

17:00.600 --> 17:01.680
Sure thing, boss.

17:01.681 --> 17:02.760
I brought it for her,

17:02.800 --> 17:05.079
as a gift from the humble Pans!

17:05.119 --> 17:06.560
You...

17:06.560 --> 17:08.000
Know how to play it, right?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.680
How hard can it be?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.240
Ah?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.720
Uuhh?

And the mangy little

17:30.261 --> 17:32.080
goat man too!

17:32.120 --> 17:33.720
Well... okay.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.220
But only for a concerto

17:35.221 --> 17:36.680
and one light opera!

[dragon shrieks]

Whoa!

[Phuddle] Waaa!

18:07.840 --> 18:09.040
Uuh! [grunts]

18:10.640 --> 18:12.560
I hope he knows what he's doing!

18:13.440 --> 18:15.120
Uuh?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.760
[Panthea] What is this?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.440
A Pan, my queen.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.920
According to him,

18:19.960 --> 18:21.280
he is some kind

18:21.281 --> 18:22.600
of musical prodigy.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.480
According to everybody.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.440
You! Play it for me!

18:27.480 --> 18:29.400
I thought you'd never ask.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.640
Woa!

18:34.680 --> 18:36.760
[Panthea] Play. Play!!!

18:36.800 --> 18:38.260
You know, a nice bouquet

18:38.261 --> 18:39.720
of flowers in a vase here

18:39.760 --> 18:41.360
would be really inspiring!

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
- Play!!!

18:42.401 --> 18:43.401
- All right, all right!

Phuddle! Don't stop playing!

- you're looking for is...

[Panthea] Grab her!

19:30.640 --> 19:31.880
"Encore".

19:31.920 --> 19:33.280
What do you want me to play?!

[Panthea] What's she doing?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.760
What note? C-flat? Or D?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.080

20:00.480 --> 20:02.560
I'll take that.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.440
Nice work!

20:04.480 --> 20:05.640
I gotta hand it to you,

20:05.680 --> 20:07.920
that was one gutsy plan.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.800
And here is the trumptus piece!

20:10.840 --> 20:11.880
You can stop playing now,

20:11.881 --> 20:12.920
Phuddle!

20:12.960 --> 20:14.060
We gotta go

20:14.061 --> 20:15.160
before Panthea comes back!

20:15.200 --> 20:17.560
But what about the Unichordian?!

20:17.600 --> 20:19.320
It's going to have to stay here.

Noooo...

20:20.640 --> 20:22.160
- Sorry Phuddle.
- Oouh!

At least she'll stay among

Hey! Yeaaah!

The next one

And brakes!

Naaah, don't need them.

- You know,
- to make room for the cup holder.

Agh! Don't even mention

20:44.461 --> 20:45.880

[Phuddle] I don't know about you

21:10.160 --> 21:11.640

21:11.680 --> 21:14.480
I'm going to create a musical.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.360
Hey Mo, can you sing?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.620
[Mo] Yep.

21:17.621 --> 21:18.840
About as well as you can play.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.560
[Phuddle] That good, eh?

21:20.600 --> 21:21.860
We are gonna have a head

21:21.861 --> 21:23.120
on our hands!

21:35.120 --> 21:36.880
Remember, no one likes a snitch!

21:38.720 --> 21:40.220
So, how did it go with

21:40.221 --> 21:41.720
the falling bodies experiment?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.900
Actually, we decided

21:42.901 --> 21:44.040
to work as individuals.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.880
- [teacher] Mhmm...
- Here's mine.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.560
Oh! Interesting.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.960
Why is this section

21:51.961 --> 21:53.400
highlighted...?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.360
It's dried egg yolk.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.040
And this is my project.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.120
Which I did all by myself.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.740
Oh this is very impressive,

22:05.741 --> 22:07.320
Violetta.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.000
Organized and well presented.

22:11.200 --> 22:15.000
Definitely A-plus material.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.700
Thank you.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.360
I would have to agree.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.840
At least, it was A-plus material

22:20.880 --> 22:22.100
when it was submitted

22:22.101 --> 22:23.320
three years ago

22:23.360 --> 22:24.800
by another student.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.760
The second time around,

22:27.800 --> 22:31.000
I'd say it's closer to an F.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.280
But... you can't...

22:34.320 --> 22:37.200
Mia, at least you tried.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.640
C-minus.

Violetta, "C" me after class.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.900

22:47.760 --> 22:49.520
Well... I guess what goes up

22:49.521 --> 22:51.280
must come down, huh?

22:51.320 --> 22:52.320

22:52.321 --> 22:53.321
of failing bodies.

22:54.305 --> 23:00.300
