the GMAT, and the GRE.

if mermaids exist.

up to you, is it?

34:57.321 --> 35:01.172
Unlike everyone else here,
I don't work for you.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.492

or there be consequences.

to do, Elena?

35:07.180 --> 35:09.180

your great uncle.

Okay, don't quit on me.

35:35.283 --> 35:37.709
We're almost to the king, okay?

35:37.861 --> 35:39.594
He's gonna fix everything.

35:42.532 --> 35:46.226
- Princess Gwen,
you look disappointed.

35:48.872 --> 35:51.055
- Bea, what's going on?

35:51.208 --> 35:53.966
- I told prince Anton
you had returned.

35:54.044 --> 35:58.046
- You betrayed me? Why?

35:58.064 --> 36:00.657
- I spent my best years
looking after you

36:00.734 --> 36:03.160
while my own children
lived in squalor.

36:03.236 --> 36:06.237
In exchange for my loyalty,

36:06.314 --> 36:09.557
the prince has offered me
a title I deserve.

36:09.559 --> 36:13.077
- But you can't trust him.
He's a monster.

36:13.154 --> 36:15.063
- And you are weak.

36:15.081 --> 36:17.823
You were never fit
to be my queen.

36:38.846 --> 36:40.104
- Your loyal maid.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.699
And she'll be richly rewarded.

36:42.776 --> 36:46.094
Your father has been strangling
my trade routes for a decade.

36:46.112 --> 36:47.554
You convinced me
you were a man of honor,

36:47.556 --> 36:49.280
but you're even worse
than he is.

36:49.433 --> 36:50.765
I hope you enjoy the dungeon.

36:50.784 --> 36:52.334
Take her too.

36:54.104 --> 36:57.105
- Father, Lance saved me.

36:57.123 --> 37:00.108
We must take care of him,
and no leeches.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.459
- Of course.

37:01.536 --> 37:04.295
When he is recovered,
he'll make an excellent knight.

37:04.448 --> 37:07.224
- It'd be my honor,
Your Majesty.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.119
Will you come see me
while I heal?

37:11.137 --> 37:13.563
- All the king's men
couldn't keep me away.

37:18.812 --> 37:20.311
- You've made me very proud.

37:20.464 --> 37:22.697
- I've made myself proud too.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.468
[laughter]

37:26.470 --> 37:27.485
You knew?

37:27.729 --> 37:29.804
- After you said
Prince Anton unsettled you,

37:29.823 --> 37:31.306
I made it a point to listen.

37:31.308 --> 37:33.416
When you're infirm,
or people think you are,

37:33.493 --> 37:35.643
they speak freely
in your presence.

37:35.645 --> 37:37.754
I heard they ask for
an audience with the prince

37:37.981 --> 37:40.239
and put it all together.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.241
- You literally
saved the day, Fern.

37:42.319 --> 37:44.094
- It's all favor
after saving my life.

37:44.245 --> 37:46.388
YOLO.
[laughter]

37:50.102 --> 37:52.310
- Welcome back, Princess.

37:53.847 --> 37:56.014
- Wait.
It's over?

37:56.166 --> 37:57.757
- Well, every fantasy
must come to an end.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.427
The good news is,
you got a parting gift.

38:01.505 --> 38:03.947
- I don't care about jewels.

38:04.098 --> 38:06.174
I care about Lance.

38:06.192 --> 38:07.509
I mean,
is he gonna be okay?

38:07.511 --> 38:10.161
- I wasn't talking
about your necklace.

38:15.852 --> 38:18.703
- [gasps]

38:18.855 --> 38:20.188
Where did you get this?

38:20.190 --> 38:22.132
- From another guest actually.

38:22.208 --> 38:23.282
A comic book artist

38:23.360 --> 38:26.803
who recently completed
his own fantasy.

38:26.954 --> 38:29.288
I believe you've met.

38:29.366 --> 38:30.765
- Gwen?

38:38.091 --> 38:40.317
I thought
I'd never see you again.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.968
- Well, I thought I lost you.

38:43.046 --> 38:44.379
- What are you doing here?

38:44.381 --> 38:48.216
- Well, spoiler alert,
I'm not actually a princess.

38:48.234 --> 38:50.142
- You were in a fantasy too.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.495
- Well, I guess
I was pretty convincing.

38:52.647 --> 38:54.814
- Well,
now that I think about it...

38:54.908 --> 38:55.907
[laughter]

38:56.059 --> 38:57.075
- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

38:57.151 --> 38:59.227
- It's all good.
I'm healed.

38:59.245 --> 39:01.320
I do get to keep this, though.

39:01.398 --> 39:05.842
- Huh, that healed pretty
nicely, if I do say so myself.

39:05.993 --> 39:07.326
Wait, what was your fantasy?

39:07.404 --> 39:09.012
- I've spent my entire life
drawing comics

39:09.163 --> 39:12.015
about a hero saving the day.

39:12.092 --> 39:15.167
Mm-mm-mm, I wanted
to be a hero for once.

39:15.245 --> 39:17.412
Although I'm not sure
our adventure counts.

39:17.414 --> 39:19.764
I think you did
most of the saving.

39:19.841 --> 39:21.507
- It totally counts.

39:21.585 --> 39:25.678
I mean, you helped me
believe in myself,

39:25.755 --> 39:27.146
so you're my hero.

39:27.199 --> 39:28.365
- You're mine too.

Isla might be here.

40:04.886 --> 40:06.736
- Seems she's not coming.

40:09.223 --> 40:10.298
- Yeah.

40:10.316 --> 40:13.410
- Why don't we raid
the resort kitchen

40:13.486 --> 40:15.987
because I heard the chef say
something about flan?

40:16.063 --> 40:19.231
- Hmm, mm-hmm.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.901
Well, I suppose
there's no sense

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
in standing alone in the dark.

40:23.997 --> 40:25.830
[chuckles]

40:25.907 --> 40:29.984
Maybe we could check out
that suite with endless cheese.

40:29.986 --> 40:32.712
- Who told you about that, huh?

40:32.747 --> 40:34.681
Come on.
- [laughs]

40:40.772 --> 40:43.773
- No song in your head
this morning?

40:43.850 --> 40:45.349
- Radio silence.

40:45.502 --> 40:47.593
It's strange, I can't
even remember the tone.

40:47.671 --> 40:50.930
- Hmm, maybe all the cheese
blocked it out.

40:51.007 --> 40:52.340
- [chuckles]

40:52.358 --> 40:56.101
- Elena, Ruby,
thank you so much.

40:56.179 --> 40:57.528
I'm back on my path,

40:57.605 --> 40:59.789
and I'm not gonna let anyone
knock me off of it.

40:59.866 --> 41:02.107
- I am so pleased to hear it.

41:02.185 --> 41:04.018
You're gonna make
an excellent doctor.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.353
- She something,
isn't she?

41:05.371 --> 41:08.965
- Oh, I like
what I'm sensing here.

41:09.042 --> 41:11.634
- I have
my next comic book series:

41:11.711 --> 41:13.211
"Guinevere of Glendale."

41:13.305 --> 41:16.622
- So happy you both got
what you needed and then some.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.641
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

41:22.797 --> 41:24.964
- Aw, young love.

41:25.041 --> 41:27.967
So simple and sweet.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.803
- Elena, can I get a sec?
- Yeah.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.572
- I'll be on my way.

41:35.476 --> 41:38.052
- Listen,
I thought about it,

41:38.054 --> 41:40.622
and I can't.

41:42.817 --> 41:45.226
- You can't?

41:45.228 --> 41:47.912
- You made a decision
about us

41:48.064 --> 41:49.564
without allowing me
to weigh in.

41:49.566 --> 41:51.991
- I wanna explain why.
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.235
Why does it matter?
- Javier.

41:54.237 --> 41:57.405
- Elena,
if I let you explain,

41:57.407 --> 42:00.091
I won't be able
to stay mad at you.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.852
Being mad is
how I'm gonna get through this.

42:03.004 --> 42:05.246
- Maybe this is all wrong.

42:05.265 --> 42:06.964
- No, don't do that.

42:07.042 --> 42:08.858
You made your decision.

42:08.935 --> 42:10.443
You hurt me.

42:11.604 --> 42:15.198
My decision is
to not let you do it again.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.443
- I understand.
