A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.160 --> 00:16.600
-Push.
-Push, Otília.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.720
Push harder. Now.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.040
-Push, Otília.
-Push!

00:19.120 --> 00:20.720
-Push! You're nearly there.
-Push, Otília!

00:20.800 --> 00:23.640
Well done. Scissors.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.480
I want to see my baby.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.440
-Is it a boy, Doctor? Let me see him.
-Otília…

00:42.360 --> 00:44.800
My baby, Doctor.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.200
The baby has some problems, Otília.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.640
Let me see my son! Let me see him!

01:00.400 --> 01:01.880
Take the baby away.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.520
Calm down.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.520
-Dr. James?
-The glass, please.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.560
I'm sorry.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.800
Don't worry about it, sir.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.320
Thank you.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.720
I thought your dad didn't want you
to work at RARET.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.760
He changed his mind.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.960
Dr. James talked to him.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.560
What happened?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.360
It's nothing. I fell.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.480
I'm getting married tomorrow.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.680
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.680
What choice do I have?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.480
When you see me again, don't stop the car.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.680
-Everybody knows everything here.
-Carolina…

05:15.200 --> 05:16.040
Great.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.120
I'm gonna get coffee. Want some?

05:24.200 --> 05:27.200
No, thanks. I had some earlier.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.440
OFFICE
JAMES WILSON

07:57.200 --> 07:59.040
I'm going outside for a smoke.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.880
Good evening, sir.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.120
Do you have a cigarette?

08:27.240 --> 08:30.680
Dassaev is passing through here
before heading to the United States.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.040
He'll stay here overnight.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.960
We must seize the opportunity.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.200
Could you maybe smile?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.240
You're not the only one
getting married by proxy.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.400
Fernando will be back, God willing.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.760
I know he will, Mom.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.120
You will have a better life
than the one I had.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.400
What does that mean?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.680
That you should be happy
with what you have.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.760
Come on. Hurry up.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.760
Dearly beloved,

09:52.600 --> 09:55.760
we meet on this joyful day
in the house of our Lord

09:55.840 --> 09:58.960
to take part in this celebration

10:00.000 --> 10:02.320
with Fernando Marcelino,

10:02.840 --> 10:04.920
who is represented by his father,

10:05.440 --> 10:07.320
and Carolina Ferreira,

10:07.400 --> 10:10.560
on the day they decided
to establish their home.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.680
-I, Carolina Ferreira…
-I, Carolina Ferreira…

10:25.760 --> 10:28.960
…take thee, Fernando Marcelino,
to be my wedded husband…

10:29.040 --> 10:31.960
…take thee, Fernando Marcelino,
to be my wedded husband…

10:32.040 --> 10:34.000
And I promise to be faithful to you…

10:34.080 --> 10:36.160
-Go.
-And I promise to be faithful to you…

10:36.240 --> 10:38.000
To love and to respect you…

10:38.080 --> 10:39.640
To love and to respect you…

10:39.720 --> 10:41.640
…for better or for worse…

10:41.720 --> 10:43.680
…for better or for worse…

10:43.760 --> 10:45.520
…in sickness and in health…

10:45.600 --> 10:47.120
…in sickness and in health…

10:47.200 --> 10:49.600
…until death do us part.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.600
…until death do us part.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.400
Carolina…

10:56.520 --> 10:57.840
Carolina…

10:57.920 --> 10:59.320
…I give you this ring…

10:59.400 --> 11:01.320
…I give you this ring…

11:01.400 --> 11:04.040
…as a symbol of Fernando Marcelino's love…

11:04.120 --> 11:06.920
…as a symbol of Fernando Marcelino's love…

11:07.000 --> 11:08.520
…and his devotion to you.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.320
…and his devotion to you.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.400
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and Holy Spirit.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.200
-Amen.
-Amen.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.120
Dearly beloved,

11:17.200 --> 11:21.560
let us ask for our Lord's blessings
to Fernando and Carolina,

11:21.640 --> 11:24.800
so that, united in Christ

11:24.880 --> 11:31.040
by the holy bond of matrimony,
they may be one heart and one soul.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.240
Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.280
Amen.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.640
-Fernando, my man…
-Do you feel lighter?

11:40.720 --> 11:43.000
Finally, a baptism by fire.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.320
What is it, Fernando?

11:46.400 --> 11:49.320
Fernando. Hey, Fernando…

11:49.400 --> 11:50.880
Fernando, make the most of it.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.800
You can't do this to your wife
when you get home.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.120
Let's go.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.840
Congratulations. God bless you.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.240
Copy. I'll turn 12 on.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.160
-Thank you.
-I have a reel from Maxuqueira.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.320
My shift is over. Give it to João.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.440
Thank you.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.040
Done.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.680
Were the interferences like this
all night long?

12:54.760 --> 12:56.960
-They were.
-The Russians gave us a hard time.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.360
We changed the angle of the antennas
about half an hour ago. Stay alert.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.240
-Right.
-We'll take care of it.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.680
I'll go get some rest. Bye.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.040
-Yes, get some rest.
-Bye.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.960
James has more
of those ten-year-old bottles.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
Maybe he was the one
at the house by the dam.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.480
I don't know.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.480
I'm getting more convinced
that Mia killed herself.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.040
She had been talking a lot about the past,

13:23.120 --> 13:26.320
the concentration camp,
the family she lost…

13:27.520 --> 13:28.760
She came to say goodbye.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.160
I thought she was going to leave
with someone, and in the end…

13:32.720 --> 13:34.920
I couldn't understand
what she was trying to say.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.440
We don't know what happened.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.080
I still think someone killed her.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.000
You have to be careful.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.160
With what?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.240
The people you'll meet in RARET,

14:06.120 --> 14:07.720
with your parents…

14:11.040 --> 14:12.240
Alexandre…

14:15.880 --> 14:17.440
with women in general.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.760
Do you not think I'm ready?

14:35.920 --> 14:36.960
I don't know.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.560
Right.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.640
Right.

16:25.640 --> 16:30.560
Listen, it will wear off soon, okay?
Can I get you a glass of water?

16:44.240 --> 16:47.520
Fátima, I'll come see you later.
Is that okay?

16:47.600 --> 16:51.800
I have to meet my friend.
Right. Take it easy.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.960
Champagne.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.640
Five glasses of champagne, please.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.280
Thank you.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.760
-I don't like it, you having her here.
-I'm always on my own.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.400
-You have the TV to entertain you.
-I've had enough.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.200
Your problem is you don't know
what you want.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.080
And you know for both of us.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.280
Ramiro… Stop!

23:58.360 --> 24:00.120
-Stop!
-Why are you always taunting me?

24:00.200 --> 24:02.080
I didn't taunt you. I didn't do anything.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.240
-Stop!
-I do everything for you. Everything!

24:04.320 --> 24:06.400
-Stop it!
-You could at least respect me.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.040
I'm pregnant! Leave me alone!

24:11.160 --> 24:12.360
Leave me alone!

24:38.600 --> 24:39.800
Is she here?

24:40.320 --> 24:41.400
Otília?

24:42.320 --> 24:44.240
Did you come to visit Mrs. Anne?

24:48.560 --> 24:49.880
Otília?

24:52.720 --> 24:53.720
Otília?

24:55.920 --> 24:57.800
Here. She's yours. Take her.

24:57.880 --> 24:58.760
Carolina?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.920
You made her this way,
so here, you can keep her.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.480
Take the baby, please.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.400
I know it's not easy.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.160
You do? How?

25:12.680 --> 25:15.200
James and I will help you.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.080
What will she do with her life?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.920
Beg outside the church?

25:21.480 --> 25:24.720
Everybody is different.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.440
This is one person.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.480
What about the others,
who were born the same?

25:29.560 --> 25:32.520
What happened
has nothing to do with the antennas.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.760
Otília!

25:36.600 --> 25:38.520
I promise we will help you.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.720
Every time I look at her…

25:44.840 --> 25:47.240
How could I have this
inside me for so long?

25:50.880 --> 25:53.880
-Go.
-Otília!

26:25.480 --> 26:27.440
I think my watch stopped.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.400
Let's go for a drink…

26:31.400 --> 26:33.600
-I don't have any cigarettes.
-Want one of mine?

26:33.680 --> 26:35.880
No, I only smoke Provisórios.
I'll go buy some.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.120
I'll come with you.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.400
-You'll miss the start of the second act.
-I'm bored anyway.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.720
Yes.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.720
Yes.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.640
Call an ambulance. Call…

30:53.720 --> 30:55.320
-Help!
-Help!

30:55.400 --> 30:56.600
Help us!

30:57.600 --> 30:58.680
Somebody help!

31:13.800 --> 31:15.280
Where did they take him?

31:15.800 --> 31:17.640
To the Red Cross Hospital.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.200
At least he's in good company.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.440
If Salazar knew a communist
was in the next room,

31:23.520 --> 31:25.400
he'd fall off his chair again.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.680
Dassaev cannot leave
for the United States.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.160
You have to take care of it.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.040
He's in a coma.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.320
But we want him dead.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.880
Why not use someone from the Party,
or an outside agent?

31:43.960 --> 31:47.120
No, we already did that.
We can't take any chances.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.320
-There is security at his door.
-You'll figure something out.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.000
-I don't know.
-João.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.080
I'm not asking you for a favor.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.800
What if I get caught?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.360
That won't happen.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.480
Can you hear me?
