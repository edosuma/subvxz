WEBVTT

00:00.778 --> 00:03.160
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.201 --> 00:04.747
Everything we want
to know about Hannah...

00:04.788 --> 00:05.957
-[agent] Dump 'im.
-...it's just there.

00:05.999 --> 00:07.168
-No, no, no. No, we stay toge--
-What?

00:07.209 --> 00:08.338
No, no!
Where are you taking him? Luke!

00:08.379 --> 00:09.213
[Luke] June! June, no!

00:09.255 --> 00:12.929
I pray that my daughters
live a life of peace.

00:16.227 --> 00:18.983
To think such a impulsive act

00:19.025 --> 00:22.281
could have such huge
political implications.

00:22.324 --> 00:23.743
You of course understand

00:23.785 --> 00:27.166
that your plans for
New Bethlehem are dead.

00:27.834 --> 00:28.669
[woman screams]

00:28.836 --> 00:30.382
It's what's best for Gilead.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.513
Are you in fucking labor?

00:33.596 --> 00:34.848
[Serena breathing heavily]

00:34.932 --> 00:36.560
-[Serena groaning]
-[June] You can do this.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.775
[Serena] The family
that I've been staying with?

00:39.817 --> 00:42.279
I can't let them
get their hands on my baby.

00:42.364 --> 00:45.537
[June] You're his mother.
And he belongs with you.

00:45.620 --> 00:46.622
Thank you.

00:47.791 --> 00:50.003
Serena Waterford?
We are Canadian Immigration.

00:50.045 --> 00:51.549
You are being detained.

00:51.590 --> 00:52.843
You called them?

00:52.884 --> 00:54.471
She gave up her diplomatic visa

00:54.513 --> 00:56.392
when she left
that little Visitors Center.

00:56.642 --> 00:57.894
What about my baby?

00:57.936 --> 01:00.525
[Captain] The detention facility
has no infant care.

01:00.608 --> 01:03.071
No, please! Please, wait, wait!

01:03.155 --> 01:05.660
-[Luke] Justice. Right?
-[Serena] June, help me!

01:05.702 --> 01:06.537
Right.

01:06.579 --> 01:09.501
Please don't let them
take him from me! Please!

01:09.877 --> 01:11.797
Please help me, June!

01:12.507 --> 01:13.968
June, please!

01:24.990 --> 01:26.284
-[Hannah] I wanna get it.
-[June] Okay, you do it.

01:26.327 --> 01:28.079
[Hannah] This is
gonna be my pancake.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.374
[June]
All right, this is your pancake.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.002
Whoa!

01:31.044 --> 01:33.674
-That is so chocolatey.
-[Hannah] That's good.

01:33.716 --> 01:34.927
[June] Is that good?
Are you sure?

01:35.010 --> 01:37.557
-[Hannah] Yeah.
-It looks like a lot, honey.

01:37.641 --> 01:39.143
Can I make one?

01:39.185 --> 01:40.897
[Hannah] Just let me get
these chocolate chips in.

01:40.939 --> 01:43.109
[June] As if there's
not enough in there?

01:47.159 --> 01:48.454
[horn blaring]

01:48.496 --> 01:49.957
[Rita] Are they
coming or going? [scoffs]

01:49.998 --> 01:52.002
[Moira] Sounds like they're
coming by more frequently now.

01:52.044 --> 01:54.341
[Luke] I'll just tune 'em out.
I don't even hear 'em anymore.

01:54.383 --> 01:56.261
[cell phone ringing]

01:58.432 --> 01:59.476
Who is that?

01:59.518 --> 02:02.899
It is the Immigration Detention.

02:03.401 --> 02:07.199
Serena, again.
Can I ignore it, again?

02:07.241 --> 02:08.619
[Rita] She's called me
a dozen times.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.623
I just stopped picking up
after the first.

02:11.584 --> 02:13.003
You talk to her?

02:13.921 --> 02:15.341
Not since the hospital.

02:15.925 --> 02:17.929
[Luke] She still think
you guys are buddies?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.267
-[Moira scoffs]
-She's desperate.

02:20.602 --> 02:22.187
Yeah. Good.

02:22.271 --> 02:24.108
Do you know, I don't even know
why she thinks you guys would

02:24.150 --> 02:25.403
advocate for her
to get out anyway.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.490
[Luke] She did not deserve
your help in the first place.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.455
It wasn't about
what she deserved.

02:30.496 --> 02:32.249
It wasn't about her at all.

02:32.292 --> 02:35.506
I didn't think that her newborn
deserved to die in the woods.

02:36.383 --> 02:37.636
I...

02:39.221 --> 02:40.767
[horns tooting]

02:41.727 --> 02:43.689
Those assholes
are getting fuckin' louder.

02:44.273 --> 02:46.570
-[horns blaring]
-Fuck.

02:50.411 --> 02:52.958
-[horns blaring]
-[protestors shouting]

02:54.168 --> 02:58.009
[protestor] Go home Americans!
Canada for Canadians!

02:58.093 --> 02:58.928
Go home!

03:03.813 --> 03:07.277
-So many more of 'em now.
-Is this ever gonna end?

03:07.862 --> 03:08.698
No.

03:10.576 --> 03:12.372
It's only gonna get worse.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.216
This country is for Canadians!

03:32.161 --> 03:35.793
Can't we all agree, gentlemen,
that it's embarrassing

03:35.835 --> 03:37.672
to be running a country

03:37.756 --> 03:40.720
from which people are
constantly trying to escape?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.724
It weakens our nation,

03:42.766 --> 03:44.895
complicates our relationship
with Canada.

03:44.936 --> 03:47.734
Which Commander Lawrence
has worked so hard to foster.

03:47.776 --> 03:50.155
[Lawrence]
Canada's sick of our refugees,

03:50.197 --> 03:52.952
and they sure as hell don't want
to keep paying for them.

03:54.205 --> 03:57.002
And that's why
I have brought you here,

03:57.169 --> 03:58.004
to New Bethlehem.

03:59.089 --> 04:00.843
A modernized,

04:00.885 --> 04:04.434
strategically
liberalized island,

04:04.476 --> 04:08.274
where Gilead refugees
can come home with amnesty

04:08.901 --> 04:10.363
and the promise of reuniting

04:10.404 --> 04:12.032
with long-lost family
and friends.

04:12.992 --> 04:15.373
I must wonder
if it shows weakness on our part

04:15.414 --> 04:17.293
to beg for the return
of heretics.

04:17.669 --> 04:19.046
They'll be begging us
for a chance

04:19.088 --> 04:20.758
to reunite
with their loved ones.

04:21.175 --> 04:22.135
Drain the population

04:22.177 --> 04:24.349
of their pathetic
little outpost in Toronto.

04:24.683 --> 04:27.605
There's no little America
without little Americans.

04:28.649 --> 04:31.195
But how will our people react
in Gilead proper?

04:31.864 --> 04:33.826
Won't some of them try
to defect to this place?

04:34.118 --> 04:36.038
Well, they won't know
for a while.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.167
I don't know if you're aware,

04:38.209 --> 04:40.756
we don't have
a free press in Gilead.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.594
And the traitors among us,

04:43.052 --> 04:45.015
they're already trying
to get to Canada.

04:46.810 --> 04:49.774
Think of it as our Hong Kong.

04:51.068 --> 04:53.532
One country, two systems.

04:53.699 --> 04:56.788
Gentlemen, I believe
that Gilead will replace

04:56.830 --> 04:59.336
the United States
at the United Nations.

04:59.961 --> 05:00.838
But until that day,

05:00.880 --> 05:02.884
the greatest threat
to our regime

05:02.967 --> 05:06.015
is the persistent fantasy
of democratic values

05:06.057 --> 05:08.312
in the world
it almost destroyed.

05:08.354 --> 05:11.108
New Bethlehem
neutralizes that threat.

05:11.485 --> 05:15.409
And yet,
I still get a vote, don't I?

05:18.206 --> 05:19.542
It's time for us to grow up.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.051
It's time for Gilead
to project to the world

05:24.093 --> 05:27.350
our maturity, our confidence,

05:28.226 --> 05:30.606
and, above all,
our moral fortitude.

05:31.358 --> 05:34.781
Moral fortitude is exactly what
Commander Putnam was lacking.

05:37.286 --> 05:39.916
[Lawrence]
I'll be, uh, going to Toronto

05:40.376 --> 05:42.129
to talk to some families.

05:43.799 --> 05:45.928
I'd like to start
with about 100.

05:50.270 --> 05:51.105
Commander.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.036
I can see now that you're right.

05:59.038 --> 06:02.044
Forgive me for hearing
the deceased Putnam in my ear.

06:05.509 --> 06:06.845
I forgive you, Commander.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.460
[indistinct chatter]

06:23.086 --> 06:26.885
[breast pump pumping]

06:49.472 --> 06:51.100
[door buzzes open]

06:56.570 --> 06:58.030
[breast pump turning off]

07:08.886 --> 07:13.604
I heard you demanded that
I collect the milk in person.

07:14.062 --> 07:17.110
Oh, uh, thank you for coming.

07:18.947 --> 07:22.496
Thank you for fostering Noah
while I'm stuck in here.

07:22.538 --> 07:24.751
-How's he doing?
-Fine.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.186
[clears throat]

07:35.146 --> 07:36.273
Uh...

07:37.944 --> 07:39.405
I wanted to explain.

07:39.447 --> 07:43.079
Um, I didn't mean to hurt Ezra.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.083
I knew that he was wearing
a bulletproof vest--

07:45.124 --> 07:47.964
He'll live. You're lucky
you were in No Man's Land.

07:48.130 --> 07:50.134
Even so, I know I acted brashly.

07:50.176 --> 07:51.972
And it was just...

07:54.226 --> 07:57.650
the pressure,
and, um, and the pregnancy.

07:58.109 --> 08:00.864
That's right. The hormones,
they'll make you crazy.

08:03.119 --> 08:06.083
Which is why
we should be looking after Noah,

08:06.125 --> 08:08.630
and you need
to get yourself together.

08:10.301 --> 08:11.845
Well, I appreciate the concern,

08:11.886 --> 08:13.515
but I promise you
I'm doing fine.

08:13.557 --> 08:17.481
Life with a newborn is chaos.
It would only set you back.

08:17.523 --> 08:21.071
I mean, Noah has turned
the house upside down.

08:21.113 --> 08:21.990
Has he?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.286
How so?

08:25.121 --> 08:28.127
Stubborn little creature
cries all day and all night.

08:28.545 --> 08:29.756
He refuses to eat.

08:29.797 --> 08:31.634
We've been doing the
"cry it out" method for weeks,

08:31.718 --> 08:32.970
and he just continues to resist.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.101
Well, maybe he just
needs to be held. He...

08:37.605 --> 08:38.940
He needs to be hugged.

08:39.776 --> 08:42.365
So that he knows that
somebody is there for him.

08:42.406 --> 08:44.242
That's not how
"cry it out" works, Serena.

08:45.371 --> 08:48.543
It requires a certain amount
of mental toughness.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.215
Mental toughness, huh?
[sniffles]

08:51.633 --> 08:52.468
Right.

08:53.345 --> 08:55.432
I have overthrown a country.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.270
And I have, against all odds,

08:58.313 --> 09:00.776
given birth
to a very healthy baby.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.532
And not once have I lacked
for mental toughness.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.163
Are you angry with me, Serena?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.961
Noah is one month old.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.092
He is far too young
to be "crying it out."

09:13.259 --> 09:16.014
That sentimentality
is further proof

09:16.098 --> 09:19.104
that you are not equipped
for motherhood right now.

09:19.187 --> 09:20.941
Not with your mental
and emotional issues.

09:21.024 --> 09:23.447
I know in my heart
what is best for my child.

09:23.488 --> 09:25.617
That child came from me.
That is my baby.

09:25.701 --> 09:29.082
You're in here, and I'm not.

09:33.759 --> 09:36.723
Just worry about yourself.

09:38.643 --> 09:40.062
I'll look after Noah.

09:44.947 --> 09:46.659
[buzzer buzzes]

09:51.878 --> 09:53.423
[exhales deeply]

10:06.491 --> 10:08.160
Y'all are better at this
than me.

10:09.037 --> 10:10.499
I've done it before.

10:12.586 --> 10:15.759
They used to make us scrub
blood off the Wall in Gilead.

10:16.302 --> 10:17.220
Not that different.

10:19.224 --> 10:21.521
Hey! Check it out.
We don't want you here!

10:21.855 --> 10:22.940
We couldn't tell.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.900
[protestor 1] Go home!

10:23.942 --> 10:25.027
[protestor 2] Go home. Fuck off.

10:25.069 --> 10:27.825
When we first got here,
they welcomed us with open arms.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.288
Naw, you see,
you got here before I did.

10:30.914 --> 10:32.376
When I showed up,
they were still polite,

10:32.418 --> 10:34.297
but they were starting
to get annoyed.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.218
It was nothing like this though.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.891
[man] Hey! Fuck off!

10:44.567 --> 10:45.944
What the fuck?

10:52.416 --> 10:53.460
Should we get outta here?

10:57.301 --> 10:58.887
Yeah, okay.

10:58.970 --> 11:02.978
No, I, I mean Toronto. Canada.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.694
Go where?

11:06.736 --> 11:09.450
I don't know. Alaska, Hawaii?
I don't know, Europe?

11:11.371 --> 11:12.956
It's further from Hannah.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.462
-Yeah, I, no, I'm--
-[cell phone ringing]

11:19.345 --> 11:20.179
Hello?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.060
[Lawrence] Lovely weather
in Toronto this time of year.

11:23.895 --> 11:25.106
Got a minute?

11:26.901 --> 11:28.780
America is dying.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.746
It's an idea that has
outlived its usefulness.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.290
You said
you had news about Hannah.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.963
[grunts] First, hear me out.

11:38.383 --> 11:40.846
You need to understand
that everything you value,

11:40.887 --> 11:44.019
all the things
you're clinging to,

11:44.227 --> 11:46.649
democracy, liberty, justice,

11:46.691 --> 11:49.237
all that feel-good crap

11:49.363 --> 11:50.991
defined by a bunch
of slave owners

11:51.032 --> 11:53.203
talking about how all men
are created equal.

11:53.371 --> 11:54.707
All of that collapsed

11:54.749 --> 11:57.003
under the weight
of late-term capitalism

11:57.044 --> 11:58.339
and rampant consumerism.

11:59.048 --> 12:00.886
It broke
our pretty little planet,

12:00.927 --> 12:02.431
almost ended the human race.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.602
And Gilead,
for all of our faults,

12:05.562 --> 12:07.148
we fixed
that particular problem.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.192
We're having babies again.

12:10.906 --> 12:14.162
Unfortunately,
I had to use religious nut-jobs

12:14.204 --> 12:15.247
as a delivery system,

12:15.289 --> 12:17.711
and I underestimated
their depravity,

12:17.753 --> 12:20.634
but, uh, it was triage,
and it worked.

12:21.009 --> 12:24.057
So now, with our success,

12:24.433 --> 12:26.437
we can afford
to let up a little.

12:28.691 --> 12:30.362
Are you gonna let Hannah out?

12:30.403 --> 12:33.409
No, I can't.
But I can let you in.

12:37.334 --> 12:39.630
-What?
-To New Bethlehem.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.928
A new island settlement.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.184
No Handmaids, no hangings.

12:46.310 --> 12:47.980
Hell, you can read a novel,

12:48.021 --> 12:50.067
you can keep a diary
if you want.

12:50.109 --> 12:52.531
A place where
refugees can get amnesty

12:52.573 --> 12:55.370
-and return to the Motherland.
-[June chuckles]

12:56.414 --> 12:58.125
Uh, are you fucking serious?

12:58.208 --> 13:02.301
Where one might visit
their grown children

13:02.342 --> 13:03.887
running their own houses.

13:07.603 --> 13:09.063
Are you talking about Hannah?

13:10.442 --> 13:11.652
I am.

13:12.696 --> 13:14.658
When she becomes head
of her own household--

13:14.700 --> 13:16.621
Is she getting married?
Do you know something?

13:16.662 --> 13:19.293
[Lawrence] It's Gilead, June.
Eventually, they all do.

13:21.087 --> 13:24.135
I can bring her
to New Bethlehem.

13:26.307 --> 13:27.392
I can reunite you there.

13:29.228 --> 13:32.319
You can bring your family,
you can live a life.

13:33.195 --> 13:35.282
June, I can make it happen.

13:37.412 --> 13:39.875
You're saying
I can be with my daughter?

13:39.917 --> 13:42.547
Yes, yes, yes.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.675
How many ways
do I have to say it?

13:43.758 --> 13:45.720
I think being in Canada
has dulled your wits.

13:45.762 --> 13:47.391
You can be with Hannah again.

13:49.185 --> 13:51.022
How are you gonna keep us safe?

13:51.440 --> 13:53.486
I have been grooming Nick,

13:53.528 --> 13:56.701
not sexually,
but he is helping me.

13:57.159 --> 14:00.165
He's fully on board,
and he's always had your back.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.627
You know that.

14:03.339 --> 14:05.092
Look, I know.

14:06.094 --> 14:09.017
I know that it's, it's a lot.

14:10.854 --> 14:14.152
So you can use this to call me.

14:17.451 --> 14:18.578
Think about it.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.985
[Luke inhales deeply]

14:35.027 --> 14:37.281
Yeah. No.

14:38.075 --> 14:43.377
We're not gonna go
and live in Gilead.

14:43.586 --> 14:45.673
I know, I know. I know how...

14:46.425 --> 14:47.552
I know how fucking crazy

14:47.594 --> 14:49.263
-it sounds, okay?
-I don't trust Lawrence.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.560
I sure as hell
don't fucking trust Gilead.

14:51.602 --> 14:54.232
He said that the eyes
of the world would be on us,

14:54.273 --> 14:55.819
so that we would be safe.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.326
He said
he was trying to use this

14:59.368 --> 15:01.539
to get them admitted to the UN.

15:01.705 --> 15:03.376
Who, who the fuck cares?

15:03.417 --> 15:05.212
June, I... But I just don't...

15:05.254 --> 15:06.549
I don't understand
why you didn't

15:06.590 --> 15:07.634
just turn him down right away.

15:07.759 --> 15:10.222
Because he said "Hannah."
Because he said "Hannah."

15:10.264 --> 15:11.684
-Well, I don't believe him.
-Because he said

15:11.767 --> 15:13.729
this would give us the
opportunity to be closer to her.

15:13.771 --> 15:15.107
-I don't believe it, so...
-I know.

15:15.149 --> 15:17.111
I don't know
if I believe it either.

15:17.194 --> 15:19.950
But I would risk anything
to be with her.

15:21.244 --> 15:22.330
-Wouldn't you?
-Well, of course.

15:22.414 --> 15:24.041
Of course I would.
June, what kind of question--

15:24.083 --> 15:27.047
[stuttering] They are monsters

15:27.299 --> 15:30.346
who wanna take
our 12-year-old daughter

15:30.388 --> 15:32.392
and marry her off.

15:32.893 --> 15:35.523
She's gonna have some old man...

15:38.153 --> 15:40.617
No. Look, I, I can't.
I, I just...

15:40.742 --> 15:42.454
[stuttering]

15:43.748 --> 15:45.209
[June] Luke, Luke.

15:45.376 --> 15:49.426
That's why, that is exactly why
we need to be close to her.

15:49.468 --> 15:52.724
No, June. That is why
we need to get her out.

15:55.229 --> 15:56.398
How?

15:58.193 --> 16:00.113
How, huh?

16:00.782 --> 16:03.454
What, do you think Tuello's
gonna come through for us?

16:03.496 --> 16:06.042
What has the American
government done for us?

16:06.084 --> 16:07.086
They haven't brought us

16:07.127 --> 16:10.343
one step closer to her
all of this time.

16:10.385 --> 16:13.432
So you trust Lawrence, yeah?
The Nazi?

16:13.474 --> 16:14.434
-Lawrence...
-Yeah?

16:14.476 --> 16:16.271
...has come
through for me, okay?

16:16.438 --> 16:18.442
He got Nichole out,
he got Emily out.

16:18.484 --> 16:20.363
He let Mayday into his home.

16:20.405 --> 16:22.241
He helped me
with Angels' Flight.

16:22.283 --> 16:23.786
He even helped deliver Fred.

16:23.828 --> 16:26.667
He has put his neck on the line
over and over and over.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.423
And it has not
benefited him at all.

16:30.425 --> 16:33.138
He has been my friend.

16:33.263 --> 16:34.349
-Your friend?
-Yes!

16:34.433 --> 16:37.397
The, the "architect of Gilead"
is what they call him,

16:37.439 --> 16:39.693
and you just--
You believe him, you forgive--

16:39.818 --> 16:41.237
-I'm not forgiving anyone.
-You forgive them.

16:41.279 --> 16:45.078
Serena tortured you,
she abused you, raped you.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.332
She kidnapped our child--

16:46.373 --> 16:47.625
She has nothing to do with this.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.170
And, and you just wanna
save her life!

16:49.211 --> 16:50.298
-This has nothing--
-I fucking hate

16:50.340 --> 16:53.219
what they've done to our family!
I hate what they've done to you!

16:53.971 --> 16:55.516
I don't understand.
Look, I understand...

16:55.558 --> 16:57.771
I understand
wanting to get Hannah, okay?

16:57.812 --> 16:59.524
I get-- I fucking get that.

16:59.566 --> 17:02.364
But I, I promise you

17:02.405 --> 17:05.912
you're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

17:05.953 --> 17:07.707
[June laughs bitterly]

17:07.832 --> 17:09.210
-Oh, God.
-I don't-- I'm not--

17:09.251 --> 17:11.673
Of course
you don't understand how I feel.

17:12.759 --> 17:13.969
Of course you don't understand.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.811
Look what you did
to Serena and her baby.

17:21.485 --> 17:25.033
I, I did that for you,
to keep her away from you.

17:26.703 --> 17:28.374
I never asked you to do that.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.461
-All right, fine.
-I never--

17:30.503 --> 17:31.630
June.

17:33.258 --> 17:34.469
Just...

17:35.888 --> 17:38.477
Just let me protect you
sometimes, okay?

17:39.396 --> 17:40.440
Please.

17:47.328 --> 17:48.748
[chuckles]

17:51.462 --> 17:54.175
The thing is,
I don't need your protection.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.181
I don't need it.

18:02.734 --> 18:03.903
Hannah does.

18:13.171 --> 18:14.424
[footsteps approaching]

18:20.227 --> 18:23.609
[Lawrence]
Congratulations on little Noah.

18:23.651 --> 18:24.945
He's a cute kid.

18:25.655 --> 18:26.782
Are you getting me out of here?

18:29.829 --> 18:30.665
Yep.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.420
I've got the Canadian government

18:33.462 --> 18:35.550
to release you
into Gilead custody.

18:37.177 --> 18:38.389
It took you long enough.

18:40.058 --> 18:44.693
Well, there's some things
you have to ask in person.

18:45.193 --> 18:46.905
You've gotta get
Noah back to me.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.413
You're making a lot of demands

18:50.454 --> 18:52.500
for someone
who's behaved so badly

18:52.542 --> 18:54.546
and caused
so much trouble, Serena.

18:55.798 --> 18:57.552
You have to help me
with the Wheelers.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.804
I have.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.142
Enormously.

19:03.439 --> 19:07.279
I got them to let you return
to a room in their house.

19:12.624 --> 19:13.459
No.

19:14.753 --> 19:15.921
No.

19:16.882 --> 19:19.011
-Serena--
-No, absolutely not.

19:19.094 --> 19:22.852
Serena, you're a smart woman,

19:22.936 --> 19:25.524
so you know
why Gilead needs a picture

19:25.566 --> 19:29.783
of our heralded new mother
living in a harmonious household

19:29.866 --> 19:32.330
led by a wealthy couple
in a gorgeous mansion.

19:33.415 --> 19:35.294
You don't understand.

19:35.378 --> 19:37.882
They are trying
to steal Noah from me.

19:38.926 --> 19:40.972
Well, wouldn't that
be hard to do

19:41.013 --> 19:42.892
while he's attached
to your breast,

19:42.934 --> 19:44.729
which is the only reason
they're letting you back,

19:44.771 --> 19:46.817
is to nurse him
and reduce the crying.

19:46.858 --> 19:48.904
And now I'm done
talking about your breasts.

19:48.946 --> 19:52.244
I'm not gonna be used by you,
or Gilead, or the Wheelers.

19:52.328 --> 19:55.250
Who have, need I remind you,

19:55.292 --> 19:58.966
legal status
to care for your baby.

19:59.008 --> 20:02.765
Which you, Serena,
on the other hand, do not.

20:08.485 --> 20:09.779
It's the only way.

20:12.326 --> 20:13.704
Come on, Serena.

20:15.206 --> 20:16.877
You wanna be with your baby?

20:17.920 --> 20:19.382
Serena, come on.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.599
Where's the maternal instinct?

20:23.807 --> 20:25.811
Do you want to be
with little Noah?

20:26.103 --> 20:27.982
I'm not gonna live
in the same house

20:28.107 --> 20:29.986
as my child's kidnappers.

20:33.494 --> 20:35.581
Do you have an irony deficiency?

20:35.664 --> 20:37.250
I don't give a damn.

20:37.752 --> 20:39.339
I'm not a Handmaid.

20:47.522 --> 20:50.611
-[Nichole crying]
-[June] Hey, baby, it's okay.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.907
Did those mean people
wake you up?

20:53.742 --> 20:55.996
Okay, all right.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.627
Oh, come here.

21:02.802 --> 21:07.645
What's that?
It's okay, honey. Here you go.

21:08.522 --> 21:10.024
[horns tooting]

21:10.108 --> 21:13.156
I know. I'm sorry.
They're being so loud.

21:13.991 --> 21:16.705
Hopefully they'll go soon. Okay?

21:16.913 --> 21:18.584
[Nichole murmurs]

21:19.586 --> 21:21.255
[June] I know.

21:22.758 --> 21:24.387
You know what we do

21:24.470 --> 21:28.269
when the people outside
start to get us down?

21:30.357 --> 21:31.359
We sing.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.866
Let's sing a song, huh?

21:35.241 --> 21:36.411
Here we go.

21:38.122 --> 21:41.588
You know, I used to sing
this song to your big sister.

21:41.630 --> 21:44.302
And she used to love it so much.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.142
She's gotten so big, you know?

21:48.560 --> 21:49.854
You would like her a lot.

I know it's early.

23:37.862 --> 23:38.947
Thanks for seeing me.

23:38.989 --> 23:40.784
[Luke] All right.
So what do you want?

23:40.826 --> 23:42.120
[Mark]
Lawrence is holding meetings

23:42.162 --> 23:43.665
with large groups of Americans.

23:43.707 --> 23:46.462
[Luke] Why are they
even talking to him?

23:46.546 --> 23:47.923
[Mark]
He promises them information

23:47.965 --> 23:48.967
about family members.

23:49.427 --> 23:50.596
Once he gets them in the door,

23:50.637 --> 23:52.223
he shows them pictures
of New Bethlehem.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.478
[Luke] I can't...
I can't even believe anyone

23:54.604 --> 23:56.566
would even consider going back.

23:56.608 --> 23:58.194
[Mark] Unfortunately, they are.

24:00.031 --> 24:01.158
Morning.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.786
Morning.

24:03.580 --> 24:04.415
Where's Nichole?

24:04.582 --> 24:06.920
She's at music class with Moira.

24:08.673 --> 24:11.387
-Did you call him?
-No, I came on my own.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.265
I understand you got

24:13.308 --> 24:16.397
a tempting proposal
from Lawrence.

24:17.106 --> 24:18.735
He's been talking
to other families, too.

24:18.777 --> 24:20.781
Well, it looks like you're
gonna have a busy morning.

24:20.822 --> 24:22.242
[Mark] You're my first stop.

24:23.411 --> 24:25.749
Lawrence's goal
is to kill off America,

24:26.250 --> 24:27.419
once and for all.

24:28.170 --> 24:29.549
And you're a get for them.

24:30.132 --> 24:32.095
You're a symbol
to the Resistance.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.055
You're a domino.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.684
If you go back,
others will follow.

24:34.767 --> 24:35.894
They'll think it's safe.

24:35.978 --> 24:37.481
It is not fair
to put that on me.

24:38.316 --> 24:40.862
[sighs]
Even if Lawrence is a Gorbachev

24:40.904 --> 24:44.954
trying to open the country up,
he'll be succeeded by Putins.

24:45.622 --> 24:47.125
You could be trapped there.

24:47.166 --> 24:51.593
Undermining Mayday,
America, uh, democracy.

24:51.634 --> 24:54.974
How can you not understand
that none of that matters to me

24:55.057 --> 24:56.894
without my daughter?

24:59.567 --> 25:01.404
You don't feel like
you owe your country anything?

25:01.654 --> 25:05.119
We got captured trying to get
information for you.

25:05.161 --> 25:06.163
Have you done anything with it?

25:07.165 --> 25:08.960
-We are doing something.
-What?

25:09.462 --> 25:10.505
It's classified.

25:10.589 --> 25:11.924
No.

25:13.135 --> 25:15.807
No. You do not say that to me.

25:25.827 --> 25:27.748
We're launching
a military action.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.925
We've been preparing for it
for a long time.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.052
What, like a raid?

25:34.345 --> 25:35.389
I've said all I can say.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.603
And what does that
have to do with us?

25:38.895 --> 25:41.191
What about the information
we gave you on the Wife Schools?

25:41.233 --> 25:42.276
Have you found out
where Hannah is?

25:42.319 --> 25:43.988
No, not yet.
[stutters] I'm sorry.

25:44.030 --> 25:47.371
So you came all of this way
to tell us nothing.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.625
There is nothing
you can do for us.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.921
And Lawrence
is offering us Hannah.

25:52.004 --> 25:53.967
If there was something more
I could tell you, I would.

25:54.008 --> 25:55.219
I just can't right now.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.437
I'm asking you to just trust us.

25:59.979 --> 26:03.862
Please just trust
in your country.

26:03.945 --> 26:05.114
What country?

26:12.337 --> 26:15.050
Luke thinks I'm crazy
for even thinking about it,

26:15.092 --> 26:16.637
which is making me feel crazy.

26:17.848 --> 26:18.975
Am I?

26:21.314 --> 26:22.983
It's a crazy situation.

26:23.985 --> 26:25.405
So what would you do?

26:28.411 --> 26:29.497
It's not for me to say.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.793
-Rita.
-I don't want to interfere.

26:33.505 --> 26:34.798
I'm asking you.

26:41.521 --> 26:43.441
I'm moving forward
with my life here.

26:44.652 --> 26:46.154
I would never go back there.

26:47.574 --> 26:48.409
Yeah.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.914
Right. Okay.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.674
But I don't have a child there.

26:58.638 --> 26:59.849
What if you did?

27:05.234 --> 27:07.781
If there were a world
where my son isn't dead?

27:14.461 --> 27:17.049
I would do anything
to see him again.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.268
I would travel
to the ends of the earth.

27:31.286 --> 27:32.664
[buzzer buzzes]

27:35.545 --> 27:38.551
[indistinct chatter]

27:47.276 --> 27:48.655
You came.

27:50.992 --> 27:53.414
He's been developing
New Bethlehem for many years.

27:53.456 --> 27:55.418
He's been pitching it
since the beginning.

27:56.169 --> 27:58.090
He seems to have
more power than ever.

27:58.173 --> 27:59.802
So he can do it.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.555
I don't know.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.770
I don't have a lot of clarity
on Gilead politics right now.

28:04.853 --> 28:06.565
I'm trying to move on
without them,

28:06.607 --> 28:10.072
which is why
I wanted to talk to you.

28:14.498 --> 28:17.044
I just need help
finding an advocate.

28:18.423 --> 28:19.508
I need a lawyer

28:19.550 --> 28:22.179
or, um, a Canadian citizen
to sponsor me.

28:22.221 --> 28:23.391
Anything.

28:27.566 --> 28:28.609
We're not...

28:28.776 --> 28:31.197
We're not friends, Serena.

28:34.997 --> 28:36.417
But you forgave me.

28:37.502 --> 28:38.629
No.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.604
I can never forgive you.

28:47.355 --> 28:48.900
Then why did you save my life?

28:48.941 --> 28:51.363
You saved my life
and you saved my child's life.

28:51.447 --> 28:53.409
He hadn't done anything wrong.

28:53.826 --> 28:55.705
Look,
you can dismiss it all you want,

28:55.747 --> 28:58.544
but you were there with me
in that barn.

28:59.546 --> 29:01.174
You and I, we have a bond.

29:01.425 --> 29:03.805
We have been through
so much together.

29:05.098 --> 29:06.602
Yeah. [chuckles]

29:12.948 --> 29:14.827
I turned the other cheek.

29:19.210 --> 29:21.382
Turns out, after all this, I...

29:24.053 --> 29:26.224
I guess
I'm a better Christian than you.

29:36.871 --> 29:38.583
[exhales deeply]

29:46.807 --> 29:48.059
[sniffles]

29:49.103 --> 29:50.188
[chuckles]

29:51.400 --> 29:53.069
What am I supposed to do now?

29:56.702 --> 29:57.787
Um...

29:59.541 --> 30:01.462
go back to the Wheelers.

30:04.216 --> 30:05.386
[chuckles]

30:06.095 --> 30:06.931
How?

30:10.020 --> 30:11.649
How do you go
and live in a house

30:11.690 --> 30:14.111
with a woman
who's trying to steal your baby?

30:19.121 --> 30:21.167
Are you seriously
asking me that?

30:21.250 --> 30:22.295
[sniffles]

30:30.478 --> 30:31.855
How did you ever...

30:36.365 --> 30:38.201
How did you ever live with me?

30:38.284 --> 30:39.413
[chuckles]

30:45.550 --> 30:46.635
[June] Um...

30:54.901 --> 30:56.029
Here's what you're gonna do.

30:56.112 --> 30:57.072
Okay?

31:02.542 --> 31:04.128
You're gonna go back in there,

31:06.508 --> 31:08.846
and you are gonna act
like a Handmaid.

31:11.810 --> 31:13.397
But the entire time,

31:15.067 --> 31:17.739
you will be plotting
against them

31:18.449 --> 31:20.745
and planning your revenge.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.182
Is that what you did?

31:33.061 --> 31:35.232
Look at what happened to Fred.

31:39.491 --> 31:41.202
And look at you now.

31:51.013 --> 31:51.849
[Serena] June.

31:53.477 --> 31:56.984
What would you do
if you were me?

32:01.994 --> 32:02.912
Listen to me.

32:04.457 --> 32:07.964
You cannot help your child
if you're not with them.

32:15.354 --> 32:16.773
I would go back.

32:29.549 --> 32:30.885
[door opens]

32:32.262 --> 32:33.891
-[door closes]
-She's okay.

32:37.774 --> 32:39.778
See how I make everything
work out for you?

32:40.404 --> 32:41.698
Luke does not trust you.

32:43.117 --> 32:44.161
But you do.

32:44.746 --> 32:48.504
What can I do to persuade
the reluctant husband?

32:48.587 --> 32:49.839
He's got proof of life.

32:49.923 --> 32:52.052
Stop them
from marrying off Hannah.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.436
I think that's...
That's outta my hands.

32:56.895 --> 32:59.484
But if I do
what you want me to do,

32:59.567 --> 33:01.195
could you stop it?

33:02.532 --> 33:04.703
Gilead's gonna Gilead.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.421
You could be with her, June.
Wouldn't that make you happy?

33:10.339 --> 33:14.179
While she's being raped
by someone twice her age?

33:14.306 --> 33:15.891
Bah, it's an arranged marriage.

33:15.975 --> 33:16.977
Fuck you!

33:18.605 --> 33:20.025
Fuck you!

33:22.864 --> 33:27.540
All the girls, all the women
raped, tortured, abused

33:28.124 --> 33:30.421
in a world that you created,

33:31.255 --> 33:32.967
you sick fuck!

33:40.775 --> 33:42.487
You think I don't know?

33:47.287 --> 33:49.626
You think I don't know
the misery that I've caused?

33:49.709 --> 33:50.795
You think...

33:54.093 --> 33:55.304
You think I'm unaware?

33:58.017 --> 33:59.729
I was trying to save humanity.

34:02.860 --> 34:04.113
And, you know, I did.

34:05.156 --> 34:06.535
I fucking did it.

34:09.039 --> 34:11.336
Then it got away, away from me.

34:12.422 --> 34:13.632
It went septic.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.055
You think
I wouldn't take it back?

34:17.097 --> 34:17.932
I would take it all back.

34:18.057 --> 34:21.731
I'd let the whole fucking
human race just die out,

34:21.773 --> 34:23.151
just so I wouldn't have...

34:23.819 --> 34:27.033
have Gilead on my conscience.

34:27.117 --> 34:28.119
So do something.

34:28.202 --> 34:30.666
I am! I am!

34:30.708 --> 34:34.214
That is what
New Bethlehem is, June.

34:34.799 --> 34:36.887
It's, it's a better place.

34:37.763 --> 34:41.980
It's the place
we wrestle a better future

34:42.022 --> 34:44.486
out of an unchangeable past.

34:44.527 --> 34:48.159
A, a place without
the, the sham trials,

34:48.201 --> 34:49.996
and the torture,
without child brides.

34:50.079 --> 34:51.750
Hannah's
going to be a child bride.

34:51.791 --> 34:53.795
But Nichole will not!

34:54.422 --> 34:57.553
By the time she comes of age
in New Bethlehem, don't you--

34:57.595 --> 34:58.430
How?

34:58.931 --> 35:00.099
How? How is that going--

35:00.141 --> 35:02.939
Countries modernize.

35:02.980 --> 35:04.859
Countries can get better.
I've seen it.

35:05.819 --> 35:07.698
We start in New Bethlehem.

35:08.074 --> 35:10.036
And with those
reforms and success,

35:10.078 --> 35:11.957
five years, ten years,

35:14.253 --> 35:17.385
all of Gilead
could be like that.

35:17.885 --> 35:20.766
A place that doesn't trample
on human rights

35:20.808 --> 35:23.730
a place that will let you leave.

35:23.772 --> 35:26.695
Singapore of yore,
with any luck.

35:27.697 --> 35:29.199
June, I need you.

35:31.705 --> 35:33.124
Come help me fix it.

35:34.878 --> 35:35.713
June.

35:38.719 --> 35:41.181
Come to New Bethlehem,
come be with your daughter.

35:41.725 --> 35:43.937
Come help me make
more of a difference in Gilead

35:43.979 --> 35:45.733
than Mayday ever will.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.116
You really believe
you can fix it?

35:51.995 --> 35:54.166
I have to. I have to believe it.

35:57.465 --> 35:58.592
I have no choice.

36:03.352 --> 36:05.314
It's either that or, or yeah...

36:08.027 --> 36:09.781
kill myself,
like Eleanor, y'know.

36:12.243 --> 36:13.830
One or the other.

36:27.483 --> 36:29.862
[breathing heavily]

36:37.503 --> 36:39.298
[Hannah giggling]

36:42.220 --> 36:43.348
[Luke] June.

36:43.807 --> 36:45.018
[Hannah giggling]

36:45.101 --> 36:46.228
June.

36:47.565 --> 36:48.984
You got a package.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.615
-Do you see it?
-Yeah.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.286
[June gasps]
Oh, my God, it's her.

37:25.390 --> 37:26.726
Play it again.

37:51.442 --> 37:52.444
She needs us.

37:54.407 --> 37:55.784
She needs us.

37:58.331 --> 37:59.166
We have to go.

37:59.207 --> 38:01.086
We have to go be with her,
wherever she is.

38:02.715 --> 38:03.758
She needs us.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.056
We have to go before
something worse happens to her.

38:07.098 --> 38:08.058
Okay. Listen.

38:08.142 --> 38:09.060
-There, all right?
-'Kay.

38:09.102 --> 38:11.273
All right, look, I want that.
All right? You know that, right?

38:11.316 --> 38:13.486
I wanna go,
but I can't let you go.

38:14.947 --> 38:18.203
June, what is to say
the moment you cross that border

38:18.245 --> 38:19.707
that they don't just
put you on the fucking Wall?

38:19.749 --> 38:21.753
Then what are we going to do?
What are we going to do about--

38:21.794 --> 38:23.130
I don't know.
We're trying to figure it out.

38:23.172 --> 38:24.132
What are you gonna do?

38:24.174 --> 38:25.802
Are you just gonna do
the same thing you've done

38:25.844 --> 38:27.013
for the last seven years?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.265
Fucking nothing?

38:36.616 --> 38:39.162
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

38:39.204 --> 38:42.586
That wasn't what I meant.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.308
-It's fine.
-I'm trying to...

38:52.230 --> 38:55.821
You know, I have this feeling
that you're gonna go

38:55.862 --> 38:57.324
and you're never
gonna come back?

38:58.785 --> 39:00.539
But we can go as a family.

39:00.622 --> 39:02.291
No, we're not gonna take
Nichole to Gilead.

39:02.334 --> 39:03.670
-We're not gonna do that.
-Then I'm gonna

39:03.712 --> 39:05.131
have to go without you.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.222
I'm gonna have to go.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.226
[laughing]

39:12.813 --> 39:14.650
I know it's crazy. I know.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.531
We're never gonna
be enough for you, are we?

39:18.032 --> 39:21.204
You and Nichole,
you will be fine.

39:21.956 --> 39:23.418
You'll be okay.

39:24.962 --> 39:26.299
And she needs me.

39:28.177 --> 39:32.895
She needs me,
and I just left her there.

39:35.442 --> 39:37.236
I left her behind.

39:37.821 --> 39:39.742
-It was--
-You stayed, June.

39:39.784 --> 39:42.080
-You stayed for so many years.
-It was the one thing

39:42.121 --> 39:43.833
I promised I would never do.

39:43.958 --> 39:45.044
You stayed
for so many years, June.

39:45.086 --> 39:47.466
-I cannot be here.
-Just stay.

39:47.633 --> 39:50.972
I was never supposed
to leave her.

39:51.014 --> 39:54.897
I, I abandoned her.

39:55.732 --> 39:57.861
I left her behind,

39:57.903 --> 40:00.032
-and I have to go back to her.
-No, no.

40:00.074 --> 40:03.957
I have to go back to her.
I have to. I have to.

40:04.290 --> 40:07.673
I have to go back for her. Okay?

40:09.552 --> 40:10.512
[sobbing] I have to.

40:11.347 --> 40:13.810
I left her. I left her behind.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.524
I left my baby.

40:24.790 --> 40:28.381
[Lawrence] Reminds me
of those old coffee table books.

40:28.590 --> 40:32.054
Picturesque Villages
of Vintage New England.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.391
[Lawrence chuckles]

40:33.600 --> 40:35.687
You really did it
after all this time.

40:36.898 --> 40:40.697
Well, first came
the lifting of sanctions.

40:40.780 --> 40:41.699
That was point one.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.955
Next will come
political reforms.

40:44.997 --> 40:47.961
Smart, limited,
but reforms nonetheless.

40:48.253 --> 40:50.467
That's... Let's see.

40:50.550 --> 40:53.515
Yeah, that's point four
of my 400-point plan.

40:54.934 --> 40:56.562
Which way is June leaning?

40:58.148 --> 41:00.027
I think
we're getting her to a yes.

41:01.781 --> 41:02.783
If I had to put money on it,

41:03.868 --> 41:05.162
I'd say June and Nichole

41:05.204 --> 41:07.543
will be here
in the next year or two.

41:11.592 --> 41:12.469
Do you really think so?

41:13.220 --> 41:14.222
I do.

41:17.396 --> 41:18.731
So, what do you think?

41:19.650 --> 41:20.860
You like?

41:22.614 --> 41:24.827
I could see you and Rose here.

41:25.453 --> 41:27.290
Pushing Junior in a swing.

41:29.628 --> 41:31.089
Could you now?

41:31.716 --> 41:32.718
New Bethlehem is gonna be

41:32.759 --> 41:35.599
one of our
most important new settlements,

41:35.974 --> 41:38.813
and I will need
a close ally as Commander.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.402
Interesting proposal.

41:42.153 --> 41:43.406
It's full of risks.

41:46.202 --> 41:47.581
Your baby could have a sibling.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.918
You could be with
both of your children.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.591
You could be with
both of the women you love.

41:53.551 --> 41:54.678
You know what?

41:56.766 --> 41:57.601
Think about it.

42:08.163 --> 42:08.998
So, what do you think?

42:09.082 --> 42:10.752
You think we can use it
to find Hannah's location?

42:10.835 --> 42:11.921
I hope so.

42:12.547 --> 42:13.716
Thank you
for bringing this to us.

42:13.841 --> 42:16.221
It could be very helpful.

42:16.262 --> 42:19.102
And if you do find her,
then what?

42:20.772 --> 42:21.816
What can you do?

42:22.442 --> 42:24.571
Whatever we can
to keep you here.

42:25.114 --> 42:28.120
Look, we cannot afford to lose
more American citizens.

42:28.203 --> 42:30.500
That is
an existential issue for us.

42:30.917 --> 42:32.169
So, believe me when I tell you

42:32.211 --> 42:35.844
that we are going to throw
everything we have at this.

42:35.927 --> 42:39.183
I get why you don't want
to give us your faith.

42:39.685 --> 42:45.154
I get that. But, just, please,
um, give us some time.

43:08.409 --> 43:09.495
[breathing unsteadily]

43:11.749 --> 43:12.959
You may speak.

43:17.176 --> 43:20.600
Uh, I'm very sorry
for my actions.

43:22.144 --> 43:24.858
I was rude and ungrateful.

43:27.823 --> 43:30.995
Everything that happened
was, was my fault

43:32.666 --> 43:34.168
and my fault alone.

43:38.803 --> 43:40.974
Well, I'm glad
that you can see that now.

43:45.817 --> 43:48.698
Thank you for letting me back
to nurse the baby.

43:48.739 --> 43:52.414
You can do that part,
but I will do all of the rest.

43:53.583 --> 43:55.002
All the duties of motherhood.

44:01.014 --> 44:01.932
Thank you.

44:02.016 --> 44:06.942
You must agree
that you aren't fit

44:06.984 --> 44:08.863
to be a full-fledged mother.

44:12.829 --> 44:13.664
Not yet.

44:13.748 --> 44:15.167
Possibly not ever.

44:22.515 --> 44:23.935
-Praise be.
-Praise be.

44:25.521 --> 44:26.857
[Martha] Right this way.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.837
[Noah crying in the distance]

44:37.879 --> 44:39.215
[breathing unsteadily]

44:56.458 --> 44:58.003
I'm sorry. May I?

45:02.595 --> 45:05.016
[Noah fussing]

45:06.437 --> 45:07.397
Oh, you're here.

45:09.609 --> 45:12.072
-Can I have him, please?
-Of course, dear.

45:14.453 --> 45:15.580
Oh.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.751
Oh, my baby.

45:22.176 --> 45:24.473
-Oh!
-He's been waiting for you.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.518
Hello.

45:30.860 --> 45:31.862
Thank you.

45:34.033 --> 45:37.791
-[Noah crying]
-I missed you so much.

45:50.273 --> 45:51.527
Okay.

45:55.827 --> 45:58.206
Oh, my baby.

46:03.801 --> 46:05.262
[Noah stops crying]

46:08.811 --> 46:09.896
There.

46:25.553 --> 46:26.555
[phone ringing]

46:31.315 --> 46:32.525
[Luke] Hello.

46:34.529 --> 46:35.531
It's Rita.

46:35.948 --> 46:36.992
No, no news.

46:37.117 --> 46:39.331
We've just been checking in
with Mark every day.

46:39.372 --> 46:42.044
But, uh, he just
keeps on telling us to wait.

46:42.085 --> 46:43.254
Wait.

46:44.089 --> 46:46.637
Yeah. Feels like forever.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.726
She's, she's not.
I don't know. Maybe there's...

46:50.101 --> 46:52.523
-You okay. You all right?
-Um, yeah, yeah.

46:53.984 --> 46:57.325
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go take a walk.

46:57.617 --> 46:58.994
You're in the middle of eating.

47:00.539 --> 47:03.379
Yeah, but Nichole needs apples.

47:04.171 --> 47:05.424
We're out of apples.

47:05.508 --> 47:07.260
So just tell Luke
I'm gonna go down to the corner

47:07.303 --> 47:09.849
to the grocer
and get the apples.

47:09.891 --> 47:12.438
-Because she...
-She needs apples.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.440
Yeah, she needs
the apples, yeah.

47:13.482 --> 47:14.317
Sure. Um...

47:14.859 --> 47:15.903
Hey, can, can I come with?

47:15.945 --> 47:16.989
No, no, no.
You're good, you're good.

47:17.030 --> 47:18.951
You just keep, uh, eating.

47:20.663 --> 47:23.711
-[Moira] Okay.
-[door opens, closes]

47:23.794 --> 47:24.754
[indistinct chatter]

47:24.796 --> 47:26.466
-Well done.
-Thank you again.

47:27.385 --> 47:28.679
Appreciate it.

47:31.309 --> 47:32.185
[indistinct chatter]

47:36.820 --> 47:38.239
[cell phone ringing]

47:44.669 --> 47:45.504
Hello?

47:45.588 --> 47:48.469
June, I don't have time to talk,
but we figured it out.

47:49.637 --> 47:51.098
We found her.

47:51.725 --> 47:53.979
-What?
-We found Hannah.

47:54.271 --> 47:56.777
We found her Wives School.
We know where she is.

47:57.653 --> 48:01.369
June, we found her.

48:02.330 --> 48:03.373
There are a lot of moving parts,

48:03.415 --> 48:06.128
and we're still
formulating a plan, okay?

48:06.170 --> 48:07.005
Okay.

48:07.047 --> 48:10.095
June, the metadata on your video
helped tremendously.

48:10.136 --> 48:11.473
Okay. I understand.

48:11.515 --> 48:13.852
We're going to raid her school
and get her out.

48:15.981 --> 48:17.275
Thank you.

48:30.093 --> 48:31.471
Shit.

48:32.432 --> 48:34.936
Okay. Put these here.
Oh, shit. Oh.

48:35.312 --> 48:37.065
-Shit. Sorry!
-'Kay, kay? Are you okay?

48:37.107 --> 48:38.610
-I'm sorry, yes.
-[man] No, no, it's all right.

48:38.652 --> 48:39.863
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-Don't worry about it.

48:39.904 --> 48:41.408
-Okay. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no, it's okay.

48:41.449 --> 48:43.077
[grocer] Ooh! Whoa!

48:43.202 --> 48:44.873
-It's okay. Okay.
-'Kay. Thank you.

48:44.914 --> 48:47.043
-It's all right.
-Thank you.

48:47.127 --> 48:48.212
Thank you.

48:49.089 --> 48:51.010
Here. Thank you.

49:03.952 --> 49:05.288
Excuse me.

49:13.221 --> 49:14.390
Excuse me.

49:21.821 --> 49:23.909
[laughing]

49:23.992 --> 49:25.537
-Luke.
-[Luke] What?

49:25.579 --> 49:26.498
Luke.

49:26.623 --> 49:27.541
-Moira?
-What?

49:27.625 --> 49:28.627
[June] Luke?

49:28.710 --> 49:30.046
They're going to get Hannah.

49:30.631 --> 49:32.175
-What?
-Mark called.

49:32.635 --> 49:34.012
-They found her.
-[Moira] Oh, my God.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.100
And they're gonna
do a raid of her school,

49:36.141 --> 49:37.018
and they're gonna go get her.

49:37.060 --> 49:38.229
They're gonna
bring her back to us.

49:38.313 --> 49:39.315
-Oh, God!
-[June] Do you hear me?

49:39.399 --> 49:40.401
They're gonna
bring her back to us.

49:40.442 --> 49:41.361
-Are you serious?
-Yes, yes, yes.

49:41.403 --> 49:42.613
We helped them,
and they found Hannah.

49:42.655 --> 49:43.657
And so they're gonna go get her.

49:43.699 --> 49:44.534
[Moira] Oh, my God!

49:44.617 --> 49:46.454
They're gonna go get her!
I'm fucking serious! Yes!

49:47.915 --> 49:48.750
Oh, my God!

49:49.585 --> 49:54.304
It's okay. I know, I know.
I know. I know. We did it.

49:54.637 --> 49:57.727
Come here.
I fucking love Mark Tuello.

49:57.810 --> 50:00.941
I fucking love Mark Tuello.
