[ Earl Narrating ]
It's nice when the old gang...

00:06.074 --> 00:09.110
puts their differences aside
and gets back together for
something important...

00:09.177 --> 00:12.080

birthday party.

- No.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.904
- Was this your card?
- I think you told me
to pick a color.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.573
- Was it green?
- I forget.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.643
Man, this sucks. I thought
you said when the gang
was gettin' back together,

00:42.710 --> 00:44.812
that meant we were gonna
steal somethin',

00:44.878 --> 00:47.581

snot-nosed little kids
eatin' cake.

Man, this sucks.
[ Joy ]
Sorry, Ralph.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.287
- Since Dudley Do-Right here
broke up the gang, this is it.
- I didn't break up the gang.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.022
Yeah, you did.
We're still a gang.

00:55.089 --> 00:58.692
You call this a gang?
How many other gangs you know
have a damn magician?

00:58.759 --> 01:02.263

- We're havin' fun.
This is fun.

You have to admit, Earl,
our gang was a lot funner
before you discovered karma.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.740
The craziest thing any
of us has done lately is
when you were in the bathroom...

01:12.806 --> 01:14.975

down his crack.

[ Earl Narrating ]
I guess Randy was right.

01:26.787 --> 01:31.425
Workin' a scam with
a top-notch crew was a bit
more thrillin' than a kazoo.

I don't like to complain
about free food,

tastes like... zoo.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.587
Well, Earl Jr. only
eats long things that he
can dip in ketchup,

02:33.654 --> 02:37.525
and Winky Dinky Dogs is the
only thing around since Pop's
Old-Fashioned Wieners closed.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.794
- Pop's Old-Fashioned Wieners
didn't close.
- Yes, it did.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.265
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did. A sinkhole
swallowed up him and his cart.

02:44.332 --> 02:47.235
A-A-And there was
a solar eclipse that night.
Tell him, Earl.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.303
Uh, yeah.
Th-That's what I heard.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.572
Oh, really?
I heard you and I
stole it for $200,

02:51.639 --> 02:55.476
and you spent your half
at Club Chubby tryin' to get
that girl to break the rules.

A few years ago, the Winky
Dinky Dog hot dog chain...

03:04.752 --> 03:06.854
opened a new store
in Camden County.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.024
Unfortunately,
their grand opening wasn't
as grand as they had hoped.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.728
People were just creatures
of habit, and they were just
used to going to Pop's.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.398
That's because Pop's Wieners
was an institution.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.934
Everybody loved Pop's.
Almost everybody.

03:22.470 --> 03:26.907

were offered an opportunity.

Yeah, buddy.
The only thing is,

03:57.471 --> 04:01.642

or anything like that, we might
need a little extra time,

he didn't need geniuses to knock
his competition out of business.

He just needed a couple
of drunk crooks.

It may have been smarter
to take the back roads,

you did that.
Yeah.

Takin' away Pop's hot dogs from
Camden County is like takin'

- Buffalo?

And just like that, I knew what
I needed to do next on my list.

After we found his cart
where we hid it in the woods,

05:05.105 --> 05:07.508

Fortunately, Pops was
a very forgiving man,

05:31.799 --> 05:34.201
but puttin' the cart
back in its original location...

05:34.267 --> 05:36.203
wasn't enough
to get things started.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.772
People were used to going
to Winky Dinky Dogs because,

like I said,
they're creatures of habit.

Luckily, every creature I know
loves a two-for-one coupon.

So, I recruited Kenny,

at the Copy Hut,

to design some discount flyers
to bring people back to Pop's.

leftover from a school job.

Winky Dinky only paid me
175 bucks this time,

pays for a new cart.

are you gonna tell 'em you

thing didn't come up.

don't go to the police.

with the fellow at the store,

over his head.

without an appointment.

- Then you need an appointment.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.864

in suits, Earl. It's like
when Ted from Bill and Ted's...

08:50.931 --> 08:54.034

and went into the Matrix.

realized the only way...

08:56.203 --> 08:58.171
I was gonna speak
to Mr. Winky Dinky...

08:58.238 --> 09:00.608
was to get one of those

becomin' an employee.

desperate need for secretaries.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.618
All I needed to do
was take a typin' test.

That's where Kenny came in.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.357

That's a word, isn't it?

After we finished,
Kenny and I exchanged our work
before we turned it in.

09:27.601 --> 09:31.772
Thanks to Kenny, and his
impeccable "type-man-ship,"
I was hired on the spot.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.980
As for Kenny, he got
a "better luck next time."

I started my new pretend career
in business.

uh, do you have a key
for this top one?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.898
Oh, that's how you do it.
I-- I didn't get the memo.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.400
You bring up the middle
section in Excel,

10:33.466 --> 10:36.603
then you'll bring up
the Word document
for pages four through six.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.674
Part will be network,
so leave the Web links embedded.
And put them on a disk for me.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.943
Thanks.
Will do.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.512
Since I had no idea what
the hell an Excel was,

10:45.578 --> 10:49.182
I decided to hide out
in the elevator for a while,
hoping to spot Mr. Covington.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.664
Mr. Covington?
Mr. Covington
is my father's name.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.734
You can call me "sir."

11:06.800 --> 11:09.102
Well, I-- I know
you're a very busy man,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.872
uh, now that you're
doing potatoes three ways
and everything,

11:11.939 --> 11:15.342
but I thought you should know
that one of your franchise
owners paid a criminal...

to burn down
someone else's hot dog stand.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.880

been informed?

witness doesn't really...

like to interact
with the police because,
uh, they don't like me-- him.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.623
But I just thought, uh,
this was the type of thing
you'd wanna know about.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.928
Actually,
it's something I wouldn't
want to know about.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.998
Excuse me?
Business is tough, son.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.234
You try to play by the rules,
but sometimes you can't.

11:41.301 --> 11:46.173
And when you can't, it's better
if I can stand up in court
and say I didn't know about it.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.312
This conversation
didn't happen.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.516

- No, it didn't.

But, uh,
Mr. Covington.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.762
- Where'd you get
all that neat stuff?
- Oh, I stole it from work,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.664
and I'm gonna keep stealing
until I get $10,000
to pay Pops back.

12:11.731 --> 12:16.569
Those executives are criminals
like we used to be, only worse
'cause they don't admit it.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.772
It's "hypochronical."

12:18.839 --> 12:22.275
I mean, "hypoconjugal."

12:22.342 --> 12:24.277
Hypothetical?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.514
But, Earl, I thought
you stopped stealing.
What about your list?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.951
This is a special
circumstance, Catalina.
I'm stealin' for a good reason.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
Just like, uh, Robin Hood.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.556
Yeah, I like him.
The guy with the green
panty hose, right?

12:36.623 --> 12:40.260
I like his little hummingbird
girlfriend, Tinker Bell.
She gets so jealous.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.595
You're never gonna make $10,000

Catalina was right.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.770
It was clear that I was gonna
need to steal more stuff.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.705
But to do that,
I needed help.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.043
I needed to get the gang back
together for one last heist.

need a favor.

and Catalina on board--
[ Knocking ]

13:00.848 --> 13:03.450
I needed to convince
the rest of the gang.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.685
Joy and Darnell were easy.

13:05.752 --> 13:10.190
Mostly because
Joy hates her life,
and Darnell's up for anything.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.526
And Ralph--
Well, say what you want
about Ralph,

There's nothin'
he won't do for $200.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.072
Now that the gang
was back together,

13:25.138 --> 13:27.975
the first step of the plan
was to get everyone hired.

came in again.

At the end of the day,
everyone got hired.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.977

5.3 seconds right there.

Very impressive, sir.
Welcome aboard.

the gang was geared up
and back in the scam business.

And although we were
doin' somethin' bad,
I knew it was for good.

only the women
wore stockings.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.979
Randy even brought
four beers because
it makes him a better liar.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.916
And now that everyone
was in place,

14:42.983 --> 14:46.486
the plan was to try not
to get fired before 5:00.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.223
[ Indistinct ]

14:53.893 --> 14:58.098
Then, at closing time,
we'd all hide and wait
for everyone to leave.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.035
That way,
we'd have the place
to ourselves,

15:02.102 --> 15:06.406
and we'd be free to steal
as many things as we could
carry without gettin' detected.

- Yeah, buddy.
- It must weigh a ton, Ralph.

No way. I am not gonna
bust my ass to steal this
big-ass copy machine.

15:52.819 --> 15:56.956
Look, it's gonna be worth it.
I got a guy in Koreatown wants
to rig it to counterfeit money.

15:57.024 --> 16:00.660
He said he's gonna
pay us ten grand
in 20-dollar bills for it.

Let's just stick to our plan.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.966

I found a box of pencils.

in the doorway, so I called

the money for herself.
