00:04.547 --> 00:06.493
<i>The whole world is on fire.</i>

00:06.518 --> 00:08.243
Viv could smash the system.

00:08.268 --> 00:09.640
<i>Astonish day!</i>

00:09.665 --> 00:11.468
- How long have you got?
- Hours and hours.

00:11.843 --> 00:13.914
Tell them about the affair
you're having with Elaine Parris.

00:13.938 --> 00:15.554
And I agree with Celeste.

00:15.579 --> 00:17.135
- Get out.
- Do what Granny says, then?

00:17.159 --> 00:18.159
Out.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.117
You must be the man with
designs on my granddaughter.

00:21.142 --> 00:22.883
They're never going to
let Viktor back in the UK.

00:22.907 --> 00:24.225
Go as far back as you can

00:24.250 --> 00:25.727
and we'll surround
you with bags.

00:25.752 --> 00:26.890
He could be executed.

00:26.914 --> 00:28.875
- So, what do you need?
- A fake passport.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.642
- And I'll need your passport.
- Mine? What for?

00:30.666 --> 00:32.226
Where do you think
the fakes come from?

00:33.416 --> 00:34.430
Just live our life,

00:34.455 --> 00:37.065
so no-one would even ask,
he would just be my boyfriend.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.250
Is that the boat?
There's no room!

00:39.275 --> 00:40.321
And they could be safe.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.630
I mean, that's better than
a death sentence, isn't it?

00:55.431 --> 00:59.626
<i>Great Britain stands
alone in the world.</i>

01:00.054 --> 01:03.663
<i>To the west, America
is the lone wolf.</i>

01:03.968 --> 01:07.320
<i>To the east,
Europe is in flames.</i>

01:07.345 --> 01:10.389
<i>And beyond that,
China is rising.</i>

01:10.647 --> 01:15.507
<i>And I want to tell you that in
standing alone, this country</i>

01:15.532 --> 01:19.124
<i>has never been more magnificent!</i>

01:21.952 --> 01:24.921
But what is Viv Rook actually
doing? Can anyone tell me?

01:24.946 --> 01:27.444
<i>I promise you freedom</i>

01:27.469 --> 01:31.153
<i>and the ability to
enjoy that freedom.</i>

01:32.920 --> 01:34.139
She just says anything!

01:34.164 --> 01:39.403
<i>An emboldened society with
the strength to enable itself.</i>

01:41.866 --> 01:44.437
- I mean, what?!
- <i>I'm only just beginning.</i>

01:44.462 --> 01:48.609
But what does she want? What
does the Four Star Party actually want?!

01:48.634 --> 01:51.201
<i>I look ahead and see glories!</i>

01:52.526 --> 01:54.273
- No, I'm sorry, you can't...
- Move!

01:54.298 --> 01:55.336
Listen to me, please!

01:55.361 --> 01:56.939
Ask her about the disappeared!

01:58.545 --> 02:01.070
Ask her out about the
people who disappeared!

02:01.095 --> 02:02.580
- I'm arresting you for the
possession - Get off! Get off!

02:02.604 --> 02:03.604
Of indecent...

02:03.629 --> 02:05.180
Can't you see what she's doing?!

02:06.345 --> 02:07.612
She's lying to you!

02:07.637 --> 02:09.821
<i>Finally, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:10.406 --> 02:14.655
<i>let me wish you a
very Merry Christmas.</i>

02:26.641 --> 02:28.149
Well, that was nice.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.164
It was lovely.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.578
It's really very kind of you
to have me here, considering.

02:53.109 --> 02:55.656
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

02:57.859 --> 03:02.257
We have a tradition,
Elaine, every Christmas to...

03:02.290 --> 03:05.335
raise a toast to those
no longer with us.

03:06.543 --> 03:09.811
And this year we have
a new name on the list.

03:11.389 --> 03:12.389
Sss...

03:14.724 --> 03:16.428
Here's to...

03:27.755 --> 03:29.699
Okay, uh...

03:35.392 --> 03:36.749
here's to our brother...

03:39.081 --> 03:40.278
your grandson...

03:42.847 --> 03:44.091
your uncle...

03:47.660 --> 03:48.904
that lovely man.

03:54.438 --> 03:55.568
Here's to Daniel.

03:56.350 --> 03:57.740
To Daniel.

04:00.881 --> 04:03.045
And Viktor. Here's to Viktor.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.591
To Viktor.

04:28.315 --> 04:30.830
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, good to see you.

04:35.421 --> 04:36.705
Did you have a good Christmas?

04:37.713 --> 04:38.713
Not bad.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.526
Well, not terrible.

04:44.633 --> 04:47.993
So, what you doing on
Friday? Do you have a party?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.251
Are you allowed in
here? New Year's Eve?

04:52.048 --> 04:53.283
Yeah, for sure.

04:53.619 --> 04:55.267
Everyone thinks
it's like prison.

04:55.876 --> 04:57.251
But we can have a few drinks,

04:58.062 --> 04:59.431
a little bit of music.

05:03.131 --> 05:04.587
Sorry I haven't, um...

05:06.381 --> 05:09.345
Edith was here two weeks
ago, and Rosie in November.

05:10.525 --> 05:12.212
They say my
campaign is going well.

05:12.237 --> 05:13.853
All this trouble
with Russia, it's...

05:14.039 --> 05:16.717
it's advantageous. It means
communications are bad, so

05:16.742 --> 05:18.266
they cannot deport me.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.291
Not yet.

05:22.358 --> 05:23.437
I, uh...

05:25.591 --> 05:27.265
I keep thinking...

05:28.717 --> 05:29.920
about that day.

05:41.116 --> 05:42.635
The things we said.

05:54.376 --> 05:56.554
We tried scattering
the ashes, but...

05:58.695 --> 05:59.739
bad timing.

06:04.621 --> 06:06.186
"He's going to turn into mud."

06:07.128 --> 06:09.107
We'll try again if the
weather gets better,

06:09.132 --> 06:10.537
which they say is debatable.

06:11.316 --> 06:12.368
But...

06:14.162 --> 06:17.570
I keep thinking, it was
the fridge that killed me.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.881
I thought of Danny in the shop,

06:21.536 --> 06:22.959
choosing all those things,

06:23.234 --> 06:24.990
paying at the till, coming home,

06:25.015 --> 06:27.537
putting them in the
fridge. A little bit of cheese.

06:32.198 --> 06:34.294
It is completely your fault.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.686
I know.

06:36.711 --> 06:38.216
No, but it really is.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.505
I couldn't let the year
pass without saying it.

06:42.638 --> 06:44.548
I've thought about
this a lot and, really...

06:44.932 --> 06:48.182
Viktor, you awful man...

06:50.498 --> 06:52.557
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't agree.

06:53.337 --> 06:54.389
Cos let me say...

06:57.446 --> 06:58.963
when you were
sent to the Ukraine,

07:00.413 --> 07:02.041
then to Barcelona
and then to Madrid,

07:02.776 --> 07:05.885
I was so bored. I
was bored of you.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.742
Everything that Danny
fancied in you was so boring.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.868
- It's okay, Stephen, I understand.
- Don't!

07:16.087 --> 07:17.759
All right, so...

07:18.161 --> 07:19.713
Well, I know my sisters
are doing everything

07:19.737 --> 07:21.368
they can to get
you released, and...

07:21.822 --> 07:23.423
there's nothing I
can do to stop them.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.900
But when Rosie sends
those letters saying,

07:26.925 --> 07:29.853
"love, Rosie, and Edith
and Stephen" and an X...

07:31.978 --> 07:32.978
that's not me.

07:33.278 --> 07:36.376
I need you to
know, that's not me.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.586
He drowned, for God's sake!

07:57.326 --> 07:58.326
Bye, then.

08:01.817 --> 08:02.817
Goodbye.

08:10.867 --> 08:11.911
Happy New Year.

08:12.702 --> 08:14.539
Happy New Year, you big lump.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.038
So, 2028, I was thinking,

08:23.063 --> 08:24.132
if you don't mind.

08:24.679 --> 08:25.834
Will you marry me?

08:25.859 --> 08:28.390
Oh, my God! You
could have warned me!

08:28.423 --> 08:30.396
You can't warn someone
about a thing like that

08:30.421 --> 08:32.195
I haven't bought you
a ring because, A,

08:32.220 --> 08:33.659
you wouldn't like
anything I choose.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
And two...

08:35.914 --> 08:37.280
we need to save, you and me.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.592
- Well, hurry up and say yes.
- Yeah!

08:39.618 --> 08:40.960
- No way! Really?
- Yeah!

08:40.985 --> 08:42.070
Okay.

08:48.953 --> 08:51.084
All I want to do
now is tell Danny.

08:52.316 --> 08:55.061
I want him to laugh
and give me a hug.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.928
I want him to say
you're not good enough.

09:00.143 --> 09:03.092
I want him to get all
snotty about the reception.

09:03.117 --> 09:05.491
Well, I could tell my mate
Ricky instead, he's gay.

09:06.590 --> 09:07.764
Yeah, that'd work.

09:13.731 --> 09:15.373
2028.

09:15.624 --> 09:19.397
When I was a kid, 2028
sounded like the future.

09:19.779 --> 09:22.803
Like we'd all have jetpacks
and monorails and...

09:23.206 --> 09:26.173
be taking our food in
little pills like astronauts.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.083
Here it is.

09:28.245 --> 09:30.630
And I'm telling you,
we're not astronauts.

09:32.452 --> 09:35.122
All I know is my
broadband is still too slow,

09:35.463 --> 09:38.411
you can't get bananas any
more, they've all died out,

09:39.134 --> 09:42.017
the kids demand
27 types of telly,

09:42.502 --> 09:44.608
all more expensive
than the last, and...

09:44.741 --> 09:46.939
gas and electric are
going through the roof.

09:48.877 --> 09:52.025
I dread to think... 2028.

09:54.064 --> 09:56.158
What the hell is it going
to throw at us next?

09:56.858 --> 09:58.806
<i>And the blackouts continue.</i>

10:00.845 --> 10:01.845
Ugh!

10:05.946 --> 10:07.884
<i>The blackouts are cyberattacks.</i>

10:08.001 --> 10:09.751
<i>Could be Russia, could be ISIS,</i>

10:09.776 --> 10:11.126
<i>could be teenagers in a bedroom.</i>

10:11.151 --> 10:14.219
<i>The power cuts mean that so
much information is being lost,</i>

10:14.602 --> 10:17.188
<i>we're going back to
printing things on paper.</i>

10:17.213 --> 10:19.352
<i>It's just so... papery.</i>

10:20.509 --> 10:21.548
<i>What do you do with it?</i>

10:22.610 --> 10:23.622
<i>It's silly.</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:28.071
<i>And tomorrow it's the same.
We've now had 50 days of rain.</i>

10:28.096 --> 10:31.454
<i>And we have reached
60 days of rain.</i>

10:31.479 --> 10:33.598
<i>It's official, 80 days of rain.</i>

10:37.837 --> 10:42.274
<i>The explosion in Leeds city centre
has been confirmed as a dirty bomb.</i>

10:42.299 --> 10:43.322
<i>I heard this bang,</i>

10:43.347 --> 10:46.220
<i>and then there's this
dust. It blew all this dust!!</i>

10:47.166 --> 10:48.884
<i>It's radioactive and
I've breathed it in.</i>

10:48.909 --> 10:50.213
<i>What do I do?!</i>

10:50.634 --> 10:51.695
<i>What do I do?!</i>

10:51.720 --> 10:53.502
Radioactivity, that's like you.

10:56.111 --> 10:59.061
<i>Reports of a second dirty
bomb here in Bristol city centre.</i>

10:59.086 --> 11:01.070
<i>The whole city's been poisoned!</i>

11:01.095 --> 11:02.772
<i>We've got to get
out of here, right now!</i>

11:02.797 --> 11:05.788
<i>It's a housing crisis on
an unprecedented scale.</i>

11:05.813 --> 11:08.711
<i>Vivienne Rook has
introduced the Bedroom Law.</i>

11:08.736 --> 11:11.123
<i>Anyone with two spare bedrooms</i>

11:11.148 --> 11:15.307
<i>must be available to take
in any homeless UK citizen.</i>

11:20.017 --> 11:21.017
Here we go.

11:24.232 --> 11:26.341
Can you let these
people through, please?

11:26.366 --> 11:28.322
We've got a lot of
people to drop off.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.202
Right, who have we got?

11:31.227 --> 11:35.335
Mr and Mrs Finch to be
quartered at 57 Overland Terrace,

11:35.360 --> 11:37.616
with a Mr Naveen Chakrabarti.

11:37.641 --> 11:39.483
All yours. Next.

11:39.508 --> 11:41.491
Lisa and Clive Montgomery.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.139
Right, we're with
the CBDC charity.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.942
We can help you get rehoused.
Were you flood or radiation?

11:47.967 --> 11:50.092
- Flood, darling.
- Okay.

11:50.290 --> 11:52.318
We've got some basics
and food coupons.

11:52.343 --> 11:53.895
That's Fran. I'm Edith.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.170
Let's get you settled.

11:55.385 --> 11:56.918
I didn't agree to this!

11:56.943 --> 11:59.522
I said no! I don't want
strangers in my house!

11:59.547 --> 12:02.459
Sweetheart, you think
this is inconvenient?

12:02.484 --> 12:04.732
My house is under
three feet of sewage.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.217
Drains have burst.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.920
I've got all the poo and pee

12:07.945 --> 12:10.225
west of Bradford Road
flooding my kitchen.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.303
So, pardon me!
Adrian, get inside.

12:14.252 --> 12:15.943
I'm phoning my MP!

12:15.968 --> 12:17.770
Your MP's Vivienne
Rook. She did this.

12:17.795 --> 12:20.586
- It was her idea.
- Oh, she wanted Mrs Rook in power.

12:20.611 --> 12:23.505
- She said, "Let's smash the system."
- All right, all right.

12:23.530 --> 12:24.567
I'm an idiot.

12:25.685 --> 12:27.896
One last thing. Do
you mind if I ask?

12:27.921 --> 12:29.239
When you were evacuated,

12:29.264 --> 12:31.396
you spent five days at
Happindale Barracks,

12:31.421 --> 12:33.310
- is that right?
- Sleeping on the floor.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.146
- At my age!
- When you were there,

12:35.171 --> 12:36.379
I'm just checking, did you hear

12:36.403 --> 12:38.942
any stories about
the disappeared?

12:39.872 --> 12:41.653
- What do you mean?
- There's a story,

12:41.678 --> 12:42.872
going around about the homeless.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.638
They say some get rehoused,

12:44.663 --> 12:46.825
some get turned away,
and some people...

12:46.991 --> 12:47.991
disappear.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.886
Your name gets crossed
off and you vanish.

12:49.911 --> 12:52.669
I'm just trying to find
out, where do they go?

12:57.359 --> 12:59.098
I told you she
didn't know anything.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.634
It's an urban myth.

13:01.770 --> 13:04.105
But, the thing is, when
you look it up online,

13:04.362 --> 13:05.524
the disappeared,

13:05.934 --> 13:08.901
there's nothing, which proves
there's something wrong,

13:08.926 --> 13:10.126
because you never get nothing.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.230
Any reference has been
scrubbed out of existence.

13:13.782 --> 13:15.770
Do you want to
stay at mine tonight?

13:17.535 --> 13:19.293
You don't have to.

13:19.761 --> 13:21.270
No, I'm...

13:24.508 --> 13:27.199
- It's been ages.
- I know. I...

13:31.711 --> 13:33.691
Well, what do you want?

13:35.162 --> 13:36.323
I never know what...

13:37.050 --> 13:38.784
What the hell do you want?

13:40.228 --> 13:41.628
It's the address.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.198
You live right opposite Danny.

13:44.347 --> 13:46.120
We only met because of him.

13:46.746 --> 13:49.354
His house is staring at you.

13:54.998 --> 13:56.229
It's not your fault,

13:56.633 --> 13:57.964
what happened to him.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.604
I know, I do know that.

14:02.412 --> 14:03.760
And it's not mine.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.197
I'm absolutely certain of that.

14:08.568 --> 14:09.736
Yes...

14:10.877 --> 14:12.010
I was there.

14:12.409 --> 14:14.357
And I helped him.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.560
But he did what he did.

14:18.299 --> 14:19.807
I'm not to blame.

14:21.732 --> 14:23.096
Neither are you.

14:26.306 --> 14:27.590
Oh, here we go.

14:33.928 --> 14:35.215
I'll stay.

14:37.931 --> 14:40.207
Tonight. Thanks.

14:42.735 --> 14:43.735
Really?

14:44.497 --> 14:46.537
Well, we met cos of Danny.

14:49.033 --> 14:50.574
Never had anything better.

15:21.983 --> 15:24.549
- Muriel?
- I'm in here.

15:24.574 --> 15:25.617
Who is it?

15:25.618 --> 15:27.491
It's Mr Briscoe
from the council,

15:27.696 --> 15:29.936
about the Bedroom Law. He
says you've got an appointment.

15:31.007 --> 15:32.567
Well, you can tell
him he might have...

15:32.757 --> 15:36.179
suggested an appointment,
but I didn't agree.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.718
We haven't got room. There
are four of us living here.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.366
It's a sizable
property, Mrs Deacon.

15:42.391 --> 15:44.827
I think that gives us at
least two spare bedrooms.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.194
It's not fit!

15:46.219 --> 15:49.990
No-one's spent money on
this house since the '70s!

15:50.015 --> 15:53.451
- Half the rooms are damp.
- That's what I'm here to assess.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.195
But you can't, and that's that.

15:57.296 --> 15:59.171
I'm afraid I have every right.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.984
Muriel, it's the law.

16:02.009 --> 16:04.023
Yes. Well, I know.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.960
And the Bedroom Law
states very clearly that people

16:06.985 --> 16:09.966
can't be housed if
there's a danger to health.

16:09.991 --> 16:12.343
- And that's a fact.
- This place isn't a death trap!

16:12.368 --> 16:13.796
I mean, me!

16:14.531 --> 16:17.382
I can't see, Celeste!
I can't bloody see!

16:17.998 --> 16:20.679
You're asking me
to take people in,

16:21.015 --> 16:23.100
and every day my
eyesight's getting

16:23.125 --> 16:25.240
worse, every single day.

16:25.942 --> 16:29.162
I'm seeing less
and less and less.

16:30.462 --> 16:33.897
It's not the house,
for God's sake, it's me!

16:39.036 --> 16:41.321
Okay, just look into the camera.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.852
"Diagnosis -
macular degeneration,

16:49.877 --> 16:51.583
96% definite."

16:51.608 --> 16:54.616
"Please make an appointment with
your nearest health care specialist."

16:57.615 --> 16:59.515
I can't see any numbers.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.897
They're tiny. They're at the
top of the door there. Look.

17:01.922 --> 17:04.344
We create a patch out
of a single stem cell,

17:04.368 --> 17:06.365
and we cultivate that
into a layer of cells,

17:06.390 --> 17:08.304
and that gets
transplanted into the eye.

17:08.329 --> 17:09.914
And what's the result?

17:09.939 --> 17:11.842
How much eyesight
will I have left?

17:11.867 --> 17:13.554
Oh, you'll be cured.

17:13.579 --> 17:14.851
I'll be cured?

17:14.875 --> 17:16.047
That's the plan.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.842
- Cured? To what extent?
- 100%.

17:19.867 --> 17:22.849
Macular degeneration is a
thing of the past, Mrs Deacon.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.765
Ten years ago,
you'd have gone blind.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.086
Good God!

17:26.458 --> 17:30.000
- That's amazing.
- It's astonishing.

17:30.025 --> 17:34.064
I've got to point out, there is
a waiting list of three years,

17:34.461 --> 17:38.485
but we can NHS
fast-track you for £10,000.

17:39.702 --> 17:41.983
- Oh...
- That's a lot of money.

17:42.008 --> 17:44.639
It's all the money
I've got in the world.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.864
That's everything.

17:46.308 --> 17:49.452
Everything I was going to
leave to my grandchildren,

17:49.477 --> 17:51.600
to my great-grandchildren.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.163
Oh, well...

17:57.901 --> 17:58.901
Sod them.

17:59.026 --> 18:00.610
Yes, please, book me in.

18:01.048 --> 18:02.460
Thank you very much.

18:03.803 --> 18:05.593
It's a terrible, terrible world,

18:05.594 --> 18:07.615
but I want to see
every second of it.

18:08.350 --> 18:11.373
- That's it. All right?
- I'm not blind!

18:11.398 --> 18:12.607
Don't fuss!

18:14.076 --> 18:18.115
- Signor, call Rosie Lyons.
- <i>Calling Rosie Lyons.</i>

18:18.140 --> 18:20.506
I thought for lunch maybe
a nice little sandwich.

18:20.842 --> 18:22.888
- What do you think?
- <i>Hi, Gran, are you home?</i>

18:22.913 --> 18:24.217
How was it? Can you see?

18:24.242 --> 18:26.388
No, it's just one eye at a time,

18:26.413 --> 18:30.201
- but they were absolutely delightful.
- Does it hurt?

18:30.226 --> 18:32.467
No, it's just a bit of
a nuisance, really.

18:32.492 --> 18:34.912
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah, I'll have ham on toast.

18:35.116 --> 18:37.128
Just the one slice. Thank you.

18:52.255 --> 18:54.216
I thought, make it two slices.

18:54.408 --> 18:55.588
You've got a gong?

18:55.612 --> 18:58.301
- Yes, I have.
- But that gong was over there.

18:58.326 --> 18:59.426
Yes, it was.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.395
So, you stood up and you got it?

19:01.420 --> 19:02.420
Yes, I did.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.400
- Okay. So, two slices?
- Yes, please.

19:11.686 --> 19:13.489
The nice ham, Celeste.

19:13.514 --> 19:15.418
Not the ham I give to the kids.

19:17.026 --> 19:18.472
- There you go, guys.
- Thanks.

19:18.513 --> 19:20.496
Enjoy. Bye!

19:21.562 --> 19:22.894
Hiya. What can I get you?

19:22.919 --> 19:24.887
- Cheeseburger, thanks.
- Oh, one second. Hey, Adi.

19:24.911 --> 19:26.660
You've got to try
one of these new pies.

19:26.685 --> 19:27.730
They're made of algae.

19:27.755 --> 19:30.722
I said we should get a
slogan. "Aye-aye, algae pie."

19:30.747 --> 19:33.129
- What are you doing here?
- What does it look like?

19:33.154 --> 19:35.236
That bit, she just
tried to sell you a pie.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.347
- That was a clue.
- But you're in the wrong zone.

19:37.372 --> 19:39.004
You don't have
a licence to trade.

19:39.582 --> 19:40.988
That's bollocks.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.152
You know I've got a
licence. I've got N13 2M 24.

19:44.177 --> 19:46.465
Rosie, they've
changed the zones.

19:48.078 --> 19:49.167
Since when?

19:49.617 --> 19:51.245
I'm told you've
changed the zones.

19:51.270 --> 19:52.689
Sorry, we should
have pinged you.

19:52.714 --> 19:55.120
It's the power cuts.
Everything's going haywire.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.307
- Blame the Russians.
- But it's my business.

19:57.332 --> 19:58.979
The food truck is
my source of income.

19:59.004 --> 20:00.651
How fast can I
get a new licence?

20:00.676 --> 20:01.838
Well, you can't.

20:01.862 --> 20:03.542
- What do you mean?
- I can't license you.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.389
Sorry. I would if I
could, but I can't.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.469
Why not?!

20:06.494 --> 20:09.115
You are real, aren't
you? You're not AI?

20:09.140 --> 20:11.471
- You're not a bot?
- I'm from Timperley.

20:11.496 --> 20:14.533
All right, Timperley, why
can't I have a licence?!

20:16.783 --> 20:18.799
Oh, bollocks! What happens now?

20:18.824 --> 20:20.602
How do I get served
in a power cut?

20:20.627 --> 20:22.994
Anyone? Hello? What do I do?!

20:26.722 --> 20:27.891
Sorry about that.

20:30.150 --> 20:31.399
Where were you?

20:31.429 --> 20:32.461
Just behind there.

20:33.021 --> 20:35.743
- Why can't you sit with us?
- People get cross.

20:36.343 --> 20:38.649
So, the problem is
your home address.

20:38.790 --> 20:40.508
We can't allow
ingress and egress

20:40.533 --> 20:42.274
of a vehicle with a
portable generator.

20:42.299 --> 20:43.891
Not now you live
inside a red zone.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.735
- What's a red zone?
- Criminal.

20:45.899 --> 20:48.063
Your estate has been
designated a criminal zone.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.468
Sorry.

20:51.921 --> 20:53.665
This whole estate, Roxie Road,

20:53.690 --> 20:55.390
right round to the
park, one big circle.

20:55.415 --> 20:56.633
Well, it'll stop the joyriders.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.665
Well, they're not fencing
us off to stop criminals.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.234
They're making us the criminals.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.585
They're locking us in!

21:01.610 --> 21:03.851
It's your fault, you and
your stupid little mates!

21:03.876 --> 21:05.593
They've branded this a
red zone because of you!

21:05.617 --> 21:06.617
No.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.499
You went to the police
and you reported me.

21:08.524 --> 21:09.765
You did it! You!

21:11.812 --> 21:13.976
- Jesus!
- Do you want me to...

21:14.001 --> 21:15.563
No, I don't care! Leave him!

21:15.880 --> 21:17.555
- We got any more beers?
- Sorry.

21:17.596 --> 21:19.274
You've had your alcohol
consumption for the week.

21:19.298 --> 21:21.468
It's like you've swallowed
the spina bifida website.

21:21.493 --> 21:22.679
Get me a beer!

21:23.628 --> 21:24.628
God...

21:27.672 --> 21:30.273
- You all right?
- Just, I was aching, that's all.

21:32.263 --> 21:35.254
ID cards. We're going to
need ID cards to get in and out!

21:35.279 --> 21:37.350
Otherwise you get disappeared.

21:38.168 --> 21:39.428
Don't start that again.

21:41.383 --> 21:45.094
Thing is, Rosie, it's not
exactly the right time, but...

21:45.927 --> 21:47.608
Fran has asked me to move in.

21:48.233 --> 21:51.467
Oh, that's nice. Like rats leaving
a sinking ship. Anyone else?

21:51.492 --> 21:52.858
What Rosie means to say is,

21:52.883 --> 21:54.506
that's great news.
Congratulations.

21:54.943 --> 21:57.270
- But she pays me rent.
- Fran's earning.

21:57.295 --> 21:59.381
I'll give you money
now and then, okay?

21:59.468 --> 22:01.809
But when you two get
married, you don't want me here.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.889
True enough. Not being rude.

22:04.520 --> 22:08.287
This flat's been the longest
I've ever stayed anywhere.

22:08.312 --> 22:09.583
God, you and Fran.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.593
You've never liked
anyone before.

22:12.224 --> 22:14.613
Well, I'm slowing down.

22:14.614 --> 22:16.357
And Danny...

22:17.386 --> 22:19.573
You know, makes you take stock.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.115
And I'll come and visit.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.435
You'll see me all
the time, I promise.

22:24.668 --> 22:27.208
- You'll need an ID card.
- No.

22:28.124 --> 22:30.958
I'll just topple the
government, how about that?

22:32.361 --> 22:35.240
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!

22:39.742 --> 22:41.216
Wait, let me see
your ID, please?

22:42.601 --> 22:44.192
- Great.
- Thanks.

22:44.270 --> 22:46.231
It's ridiculous.
They won't let me in.

22:46.739 --> 22:49.224
Said, "Your registration' not
on the list." I said, "I didn't know

22:49.248 --> 22:50.950
"it had to be." They
said, "That's your fault."

22:50.974 --> 22:52.371
I know. Come on.

22:52.396 --> 22:53.396
Let's go.

22:54.114 --> 22:58.348
Vivienne Rook done the same on
the Barton estate and the Maltings.

22:59.121 --> 23:00.582
All fenced off.

23:01.549 --> 23:03.207
- Bye!
- Bye!

23:11.839 --> 23:14.364
The problem is legal
aid is gone completely.

23:14.601 --> 23:18.536
But there's no movement from
Russia, so you're safe for now.

23:19.345 --> 23:21.145
I could ask Stephen for a
bit of money, but I don't think

23:21.169 --> 23:23.433
his new job pays
very much, so...

23:23.458 --> 23:24.816
No, let him keep his money.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.753
He's got the family, that's
more important for him.

23:29.185 --> 23:30.206
Is he okay?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.034
He's all right, I think.

23:32.059 --> 23:33.775
I don't seem so much these days.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.909
We're all a bit broken,

23:35.934 --> 23:38.245
I think, really but it's
Danny's birthday soon,

23:38.270 --> 23:41.853
so we thought we'd try
again, scattering the ashes.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.691
- We talked about waiting for you.
- No, go without me.

23:45.039 --> 23:47.095
Thanks. Yeah,
Gran needs it, really.

23:47.564 --> 23:49.823
And we're inviting Ralph.

23:50.336 --> 23:51.464
It seems only fair.

23:51.489 --> 23:54.385
He was married to Danny,
but you don't mind, do you?

23:54.615 --> 23:56.963
No, not at all.

23:58.380 --> 23:59.690
No, it's nice.

24:00.611 --> 24:01.963
We should all remember him.

24:02.883 --> 24:03.901
Everyone.

24:07.885 --> 24:10.091
So... come on.

24:12.309 --> 24:15.026
What about the disappeared?
Have you got anything?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.124
Nothing for sure.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.963
And I haven't got any evidence.

24:20.988 --> 24:22.705
They say people are
definitely being moved.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.307
Off the record, at night.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.174
I know, but moved to where?

24:27.199 --> 24:28.564
That's what I don't understand.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.493
They say they've
gone to Erstwhile.

24:30.621 --> 24:33.142
- Erstwhile?
- Yeah, that's what they say.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.199
Like, "He's gone to
erstwhile," or "the Erstwhiles".

24:36.325 --> 24:39.087
I don't know, what is it?
Is it a place, like a village?

24:39.112 --> 24:43.565
No, no, it's a word. It
means former or previously.

24:43.590 --> 24:46.259
Like, I'm an
erstwhile campaigner.

24:46.284 --> 24:49.587
- You're an erstwhile free man.
- Okay.

24:50.892 --> 24:52.111
But that's what they say.

24:52.711 --> 24:55.453
People don't just disappear.
They've gone "erstwhile".

25:06.561 --> 25:09.999
Erstwhile, copyright 2028,
Slight & Weight Holdings.

25:10.024 --> 25:12.985
Slight And Weight assert
ownership, January 2028.

25:16.354 --> 25:17.828
Little bit of news, everyone.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.625
And it's congratulations
to Bethany,

25:20.650 --> 25:21.781
because they've said yeah.

25:21.806 --> 25:23.213
The Home Office have
said that they'll fund you.

25:23.237 --> 25:24.837
- You're kidding me!
- They're gonna pay.

25:25.446 --> 25:26.883
You did it. You
got it. You're in!

25:33.155 --> 25:34.469
And just count down.

25:36.196 --> 25:37.232
- Ten.
- Ten.

25:37.812 --> 25:38.878
- Nine.
- Nine.

25:39.515 --> 25:40.538
- Eight.
- Eight.

25:41.077 --> 25:42.077
Seven.

25:42.692 --> 25:43.728
Six.

25:53.295 --> 25:54.295
Sorry.

25:55.968 --> 25:58.583
- Any word?
- They said she's fine.

25:58.584 --> 26:01.532
Just... God knows.
Plugging her in.

26:05.012 --> 26:07.726
- Did you get the train?
- No, I drove.

26:09.430 --> 26:11.842
- You?
- Coach.

26:16.721 --> 26:17.721
How's Gran?

26:18.473 --> 26:19.600
How are the eyes?

26:20.607 --> 26:21.897
That's a point.

26:22.203 --> 26:24.295
She's your gran, but I'm
the one looking after her.

26:25.822 --> 26:28.647
The Lyons have got themselves
a nursemaid, free of charge.

26:30.543 --> 26:31.614
She's ready.

26:31.615 --> 26:34.014
Oh, look at you!

26:34.607 --> 26:37.100
- Sweetheart...
- You're okay?

26:37.125 --> 26:39.389
- Are you okay?
- I am. I really am.

26:39.414 --> 26:42.193
I'm fine. Honestly,
I swear, I'm fine.

26:44.721 --> 26:45.757
There.

26:47.098 --> 26:48.833
You can let that
breathe for ten minutes.

26:49.183 --> 26:51.614
All looking good. I'll come
back and I'll dress them.

26:54.186 --> 26:55.186
Do you see?

26:55.798 --> 26:57.357
These are interaction nodes.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.396
If I use this finger, I can
open all the doors at work,

27:00.421 --> 27:03.573
no ID. And if I just
scan this in the shop,

27:03.598 --> 27:05.857
I can pay for
anything up to £1,000.

27:05.882 --> 27:07.567
And, look... Dad?

27:09.671 --> 27:10.671
Mum?

27:11.710 --> 27:13.372
I've just taken your photo.

27:14.265 --> 27:17.124
Send, and send.

27:18.766 --> 27:19.983
It doesn't need
the sound effect.

27:20.007 --> 27:21.727
I just added that because
it makes me laugh.

27:23.549 --> 27:26.035
You promised me they
wouldn't touch your eyes.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.309
Not after last time.

27:27.334 --> 27:28.721
That was years ago.

27:28.746 --> 27:30.738
Gran's had stem cells
in her eyes since then.

27:30.763 --> 27:32.098
I can't help thinking...

27:32.919 --> 27:33.919
Don't laugh.

27:34.615 --> 27:36.091
All these power cuts...

27:39.793 --> 27:41.600
Well, what would happen to you?

27:41.601 --> 27:44.637
Nothing. What happens
to you in a power cut?

27:44.918 --> 27:45.973
Nothing.

27:47.095 --> 27:49.660
So, what about your head?

27:50.215 --> 27:51.459
Can't feel a thing.

27:51.484 --> 27:54.215
They inserted the tiniest
wafer into my brain.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.214
Oh, my God! Look at the result.

27:57.230 --> 27:58.774
Synced this up, no keyboard.

27:58.798 --> 28:00.394
I don't need a
keyboard ever again.

28:02.510 --> 28:04.964
You did that by thinking?

28:05.121 --> 28:06.783
It can't read my mind. Not yet.

28:06.808 --> 28:09.587
But the wafer tracks activity in
the neural pathway and micro

28:09.588 --> 28:12.105
movements in the retina
to predict what I'm thinking.

28:12.207 --> 28:14.292
But that is reading your mind.

28:15.403 --> 28:16.675
Let's see where everyone is.

28:18.933 --> 28:20.839
There's Aunt Rosie.
She's at home.

28:22.579 --> 28:24.042
Lincoln's in school.

28:24.259 --> 28:26.112
Lee's not in school. Should be.

28:26.137 --> 28:27.861
Where is he? In the park.

28:27.886 --> 28:29.065
Don't tell Rosie.

28:29.396 --> 28:30.861
Gran's at home in the kitchen.

28:30.886 --> 28:32.011
What a surprise.

28:32.065 --> 28:33.562
Let's find Ruby.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.230
She's in a bar called the Marine
Tide and she's just bought a bottle

28:36.254 --> 28:37.971
of house white for £56.

28:38.390 --> 28:41.594
- It's 4:00 in the afternoon!
- 56 quid for the house white?!

28:41.829 --> 28:44.875
Oh, my God! How did it go,
Beth? How are you? Did it work?

28:44.900 --> 28:46.799
Are you completely
synched up now?

28:46.824 --> 28:47.829
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:47.854 --> 28:50.758
I'm with Mum and Dad, and
I've just realised, you're in trouble.

28:50.783 --> 28:52.377
You should be in college!

28:52.402 --> 28:53.578
56 quid?!

28:53.603 --> 28:55.025
For God's sake, Bethany!

28:59.652 --> 29:00.704
That is amazing.

29:01.994 --> 29:03.606
A little bit like spying.

29:03.607 --> 29:05.259
What if I didn't want
you tracking me?

29:05.284 --> 29:06.726
Well, that's a good question.

29:06.751 --> 29:07.876
Can you imagine?

29:08.152 --> 29:10.272
What if your father was
having an affair or something.

29:10.598 --> 29:11.598
Okay.

29:12.425 --> 29:15.597
You're in my contacts. That's
permission, according to the law.

29:15.622 --> 29:17.593
But I still don't understand.

29:17.594 --> 29:20.126
You can run software
like this on a keyboard,

29:20.151 --> 29:21.821
so why did you
need the operation?

29:22.120 --> 29:25.071
I'm trying to explain it in
ways you can understand,

29:25.104 --> 29:27.923
but the connection
is so much more.

29:28.096 --> 29:30.579
While we were talking,
at exactly the same time

29:30.604 --> 29:32.882
I wondered about
the 80 days of rain,

29:32.907 --> 29:35.355
where it came from, why
it was, what comes next.

29:35.598 --> 29:38.207
And I keyed into satellites
just 30 seconds ago,

29:38.232 --> 29:39.581
so I can see the course

29:39.605 --> 29:42.276
of El Nino and I can
tap into pressure sensors

29:42.301 --> 29:45.151
along the Atlantic coast
and biometric readings

29:45.176 --> 29:46.393
from the ships at sea.

29:46.597 --> 29:49.815
If I put all of that
together, I'm there.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.612
I'm inside it. The tide,

29:52.613 --> 29:56.440
the depth of the sea and the
curl of the waves within me.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.346
And right now, in
Charles Street, Pasadena,

29:59.371 --> 30:00.386
a 15-year-old girl

30:00.411 --> 30:03.253
called Ephanie Cross has written
her first song and put it online.

30:03.278 --> 30:06.210
Ah! She's got the
sweetest voice.

30:07.729 --> 30:12.440
So, when I combine
all of that, it's a joy.

30:13.334 --> 30:17.088
In my head, it is absolute joy.

30:32.056 --> 30:33.470
She's fallen asleep.

30:40.451 --> 30:41.451
They own her.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.950
The government paid
for this upgrade, so...

30:47.588 --> 30:49.449
now the government
owns my daughter.

30:50.579 --> 30:52.607
But she's happy, I suppose.

30:55.202 --> 30:57.121
If she was a drug addict
and said she was happy,

30:57.146 --> 30:58.160
we'd do something.

30:58.185 --> 31:00.332
Stephen, we surrounded
her with screens

31:00.357 --> 31:01.848
from the moment she was born.

31:02.219 --> 31:03.254
We did this.

31:07.059 --> 31:08.059
I just wish...

31:10.699 --> 31:13.270
If I could have paid for it myself,
then she wouldn't be indentured

31:13.294 --> 31:14.387
for the rest of her life.

31:17.674 --> 31:19.762
I couldn't afford this
place in a million years.

31:26.882 --> 31:28.300
We're on the wrong side.

31:30.183 --> 31:31.283
Hey, Woody.

31:32.562 --> 31:34.503
Yeah, it's been
such a long time.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.558
I was just wondering
if we could talk,

31:38.980 --> 31:41.581
if you're free, please.

31:41.606 --> 31:44.073
It's been ages, it's been years!

31:44.098 --> 31:46.409
You know, we had that
school reunion thing,

31:46.434 --> 31:49.050
"No sign of Stephen Lyons."

31:49.075 --> 31:50.993
I said, "He's too posh now."

31:51.018 --> 31:53.886
"You won't get him coming
back from London, not for us lot."

31:54.854 --> 31:57.401
Still, Debbie Bishop
noshed me off,

31:57.434 --> 31:58.441
so it's all good.

31:59.069 --> 32:00.385
Wow.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.361
That was a long time
coming, so to speak.

32:03.386 --> 32:04.534
Yeah. Ha!

32:05.666 --> 32:07.541
Yeah, I would've
thought you'd lose weight,

32:07.566 --> 32:08.846
riding a bike all day.

32:08.871 --> 32:11.119
Well, can't do that job forever.

32:11.958 --> 32:13.760
The girls don't get any cheaper.

32:13.785 --> 32:15.986
The cost of two
daughters is, whoosh!

32:17.193 --> 32:18.307
So, um...

32:19.822 --> 32:21.342
I wanted to ask..

32:21.780 --> 32:24.061
If you had any jobs, maybe.

32:25.334 --> 32:28.225
Stephen... Mate!

32:28.250 --> 32:30.662
You're the man that
lost a million quid!

32:31.585 --> 32:33.341
- That's me.
- That's your name.

32:33.366 --> 32:35.567
"The Man That
Lost A Million Quid."

32:35.592 --> 32:38.278
- Yeah, I know.
- Did you cry? Hmm?

32:38.303 --> 32:40.717
- Did I what?
- Did you cry?

32:42.596 --> 32:44.419
It was very upsetting, yeah.

32:46.555 --> 32:48.482
But I'm still good at my job.

32:48.507 --> 32:50.075
I've got to say that
I know my stuff,

32:50.100 --> 32:51.367
Woody, I really do.

32:51.941 --> 32:54.067
And if you need any
help on the financial side...

32:54.092 --> 32:57.052
- We don't need help.
- Well, I know you don't need help...

32:57.077 --> 32:58.972
We need monkeys.
Cos you know my dad?

32:58.997 --> 33:00.982
He's got me in,
right at the top.

33:01.007 --> 33:03.555
Truth is we've got
tons of work coming in.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.587
That's the thing with
Viv Rook's Britain.

33:05.588 --> 33:08.379
Do you know what it's
like, inside her government?

33:08.738 --> 33:11.113
- No.
- Fucking chaos!

33:12.199 --> 33:14.356
They never expected to get in.

33:14.381 --> 33:16.799
They're idiots, mate.
There's no plan.

33:16.824 --> 33:18.902
There's nothing, just panic.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.332
Which is perfect for me,

33:20.357 --> 33:22.223
because I'm focusing
on property management

33:22.248 --> 33:24.951
now, and I clean up their shit.

33:25.348 --> 33:26.887
Charge them a
fortune. I'm laughing.

33:26.912 --> 33:28.604
But that's my
point, exactly that.

33:28.629 --> 33:32.496
Cos I've made a study of property
after the collapse of asset values.

33:33.497 --> 33:34.965
My brother was
very good on that.

33:36.731 --> 33:40.254
And because everyone pins
it on Hong Sha, the collapse,

33:40.279 --> 33:42.083
but I think we were
headed that way long before.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.847
If it really happened.

33:44.112 --> 33:46.026
- If what really happened?
- Hong Sha.

33:47.221 --> 33:49.417
- Well, it did.
- I've been reading up on it.

33:49.596 --> 33:51.558
A lot of people
saying it was fake.

33:53.042 --> 33:55.214
No, but it wasn't.

33:55.239 --> 33:57.605
- Prove it.
- I can't, but...

33:58.814 --> 34:00.564
It's one of the biggest
events in history.

34:01.116 --> 34:03.425
My sister was there,
Edith, you remember?

34:03.511 --> 34:05.356
She was there. She actually
went to Hong Sha Dao.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.808
- She saw it.
- She says.

34:06.833 --> 34:08.641
- No, she did.
- She thinks she did.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.572
No, she really did.
She was poisoned.

34:10.574 --> 34:12.683
- She got radiation poisoning.
- Is she dead?

34:12.931 --> 34:15.370
- No.
- Well, then.

34:15.568 --> 34:17.175
No, but...

34:17.907 --> 34:21.502
- It really, really happened.
- What I need in the office

34:21.527 --> 34:23.471
is someone who says yes.

34:24.998 --> 34:25.998
Do you see?

34:32.399 --> 34:33.418
Well, um...

34:39.382 --> 34:41.411
I suppose Hong
Sha was debatable.

34:42.989 --> 34:45.072
Is that a yes, though, mate?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.333
Cos I really need to hear it.

34:49.244 --> 34:50.561
Oh, I can say yes.

34:52.337 --> 34:53.704
It's all I ever do.

34:55.837 --> 34:59.017
Yeah, okay. Yes, you're right.

34:59.042 --> 35:00.070
Yes.

35:02.203 --> 35:03.423
My money's all gone.

35:04.017 --> 35:05.540
Not a word from my friends.

35:05.565 --> 35:07.079
Not one of them. All gone.

35:08.381 --> 35:10.282
My wife and kids,
I threw them away.

35:10.751 --> 35:12.580
And I'm living with a
woman I don't particularly like.

35:12.604 --> 35:14.173
But, yes, I'm fine.

35:16.486 --> 35:17.486
Yes.

35:21.096 --> 35:22.096
Yes.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.493
Yes, I can say yes, Woody.

35:26.367 --> 35:28.094
I think I've found
myself a monkey.

35:29.773 --> 35:30.773
Yes.

35:32.277 --> 35:33.945
Now, look there for a second.

35:39.296 --> 35:43.484
"Confirmed, macular
degeneration 100% cured."

35:44.547 --> 35:47.016
"Please rate your
satisfaction from one to ten,

35:47.041 --> 35:49.049
one being bad, ten being good."

35:49.867 --> 35:51.664
I'd say ten.

35:51.812 --> 35:54.383
Definitely, a great big ten!

35:54.633 --> 35:56.789
But don't tell the council.

35:57.861 --> 36:00.756
Signor, open family message.

36:00.781 --> 36:03.093
Stephen, Edith and Rosie Lyons.

36:03.118 --> 36:04.788
<i>Opening family message.</i>

36:05.542 --> 36:06.897
"Thanks, Celeste."

36:08.049 --> 36:10.468
Now, then. Long message,

36:10.820 --> 36:14.046
hence family
link, but I'm cured.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.865
It's ten out of ten for my eyes,

36:16.890 --> 36:19.594
so I thought, let's
have a celebration,

36:19.724 --> 36:23.897
like the old days before the
bad news battered us down.

36:24.132 --> 36:26.574
A nice little feast at my house.

36:26.599 --> 36:27.608
What do you think?

36:27.765 --> 36:30.374
A proper Lyons family do.

36:34.422 --> 36:36.701
Right, then, Muriel.
Have fun tonight.

36:36.726 --> 36:39.413
We'll be back late and drunk.

36:39.695 --> 36:43.156
My daughter is buying
me a £56 bottle of wine.

36:43.486 --> 36:45.756
And for one night
only, I do not care.

36:45.781 --> 36:48.023
You're quite welcome to stay.

36:48.531 --> 36:49.804
Well, it's a family do.

36:50.181 --> 36:52.148
If you don't mind, I'm
only half family now.

36:52.718 --> 36:53.992
I'll leave you to it.

36:54.499 --> 36:56.568
<i>Phone call from Rosie Lyons.</i>

36:56.593 --> 36:58.421
Oh, Signor, accept.

36:58.820 --> 37:00.851
- Gran?
- Are you on your way, sweetheart?

37:00.876 --> 37:01.905
Gran, we can't get out.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.507
I'm sorry. It's
the bloody fence.

37:03.532 --> 37:05.429
They've sealed it
off. It's ridiculous.

37:05.454 --> 37:06.718
Well, how late will you be?

37:06.743 --> 37:08.779
No, I mean they've
closed it, early.

37:08.804 --> 37:11.583
Locked for the night. It's
unbelievable. We're like prisoners!

37:11.608 --> 37:14.076
I'm sorry, just
have fun without us.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.037
Bye, then.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.193
Oi, mate! We live here!

37:20.218 --> 37:21.733
Well, go back home, then.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.287
- <i>Edith Lyons...</i>
- Hurry up. It gets full.

37:25.780 --> 37:26.780
Edith?

37:27.359 --> 37:29.419
Rosie's had to cancel.

37:29.466 --> 37:32.490
Oh, God. Listen, I'm in London.

37:32.842 --> 37:34.170
This thing came up.

37:34.195 --> 37:36.600
Sorry, it's one
of those charities.

37:36.632 --> 37:37.966
- Oh...
- They need me.

37:38.556 --> 37:41.248
Don't worry. Work comes first.

37:41.541 --> 37:44.264
Yeah, right. I better go. Bye.

37:46.971 --> 37:51.255
- Signor, call Stephen Lyons.
- <i>Calling Stephen Lyons.</i>

37:54.518 --> 37:56.357
- Hi, Gran.
- Hello, darling.

37:56.382 --> 37:59.529
Just to warn you, Rosie
and Edith won't be coming.

37:59.554 --> 38:02.052
Oh, bollocks! Oh, I
was going to call you.

38:02.142 --> 38:04.136
<i>Sorry. Listen, I'm busy.</i>

38:04.324 --> 38:06.405
Some work things just
came out of the blue

38:06.430 --> 38:08.202
and I can't say no.

38:08.227 --> 38:10.319
I haven't seen you for ages!

38:10.344 --> 38:13.038
It's this consultation
think tank.

38:13.210 --> 38:15.256
<i>They said they needed me.
It's got to be good, hasn't it?</i>

38:15.280 --> 38:17.390
You're coming on
the 21st for Danny?

38:17.415 --> 38:19.164
Oh, God, yeah. I
wouldn't miss that.

38:19.517 --> 38:21.343
Hi, here I am, hello.

38:21.514 --> 38:23.468
Sorry, Gran. I've got to go.

38:23.923 --> 38:26.165
Grandma?! You pussy!

38:27.929 --> 38:30.413
My dad played a blinder
getting us on the list.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.537
Who got chosen?

38:31.562 --> 38:33.593
- We got chosen.
- Who got chosen?

38:33.594 --> 38:35.661
- We got chosen!
- Who got chosen?

38:35.686 --> 38:37.577
- We got chosen!
- Who got chosen?

38:37.602 --> 38:38.634
We got chosen!

38:38.659 --> 38:40.690
Who got chosen?!

38:48.639 --> 38:51.413
Do you know what? I
don't really fancy a wine bar.

38:51.835 --> 38:53.522
Well, that buffet looks lovely.

38:54.698 --> 38:56.060
Don't be silly.

38:57.056 --> 38:58.701
Don't worry about me.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.895
You go out, go
and have some fun.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.162
No. It'll be nice. We'll stay.

39:04.881 --> 39:07.498
And you made that
spinach dip. I love that stuff.

39:07.523 --> 39:09.787
I'm skipping the wine,
going straight to vodka.

39:09.812 --> 39:10.812
Okay?

39:11.732 --> 39:14.974
And if I drink too much and
make a disgrace of myself,

39:14.999 --> 39:18.015
you can watch me, Muriel, with
your brand-new perfect vision.

39:29.212 --> 39:32.497
Okay, I've got the diagnostics
and the 2025 schematics,

39:32.522 --> 39:33.958
and the blueprints
of the building.

39:34.528 --> 39:35.535
I've worked out a path.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.567
If we can get you out by
15 minutes past the hour,

39:37.568 --> 39:39.239
you can avoid
security completely.

39:40.168 --> 39:41.301
Good luck.

39:59.145 --> 40:01.606
Harriet Fry. I'm
here for acquisitions.

40:04.087 --> 40:05.087
Breathe here.

40:16.421 --> 40:17.421
Okay.

40:18.555 --> 40:20.808
- Floor ten. Thanks.
- Sure.

40:31.425 --> 40:32.957
We did it. Stage one.

40:32.982 --> 40:34.201
Long way to go.

40:34.661 --> 40:36.821
<i>I can't believe you do this
sort of thing all the time.</i>

40:38.739 --> 40:40.964
- Working late?
- Lots to do.

40:42.011 --> 40:43.784
- Night, then.
- See you tomorrow.

40:47.988 --> 40:50.626
This is breaking the law.
Never should have said yes.

40:50.651 --> 40:52.464
Mm. Oh, but you love me.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.807
Where did you get
the name, Harriet Fry?

40:55.088 --> 40:56.987
Harriet Fry? She's a spy.

40:57.012 --> 40:59.534
Oh, Christ! I'm
working with a kid!

41:01.229 --> 41:02.635
<i>Floor ten. Turn right.</i>

41:03.694 --> 41:04.917
And turn left.

41:09.744 --> 41:10.773
Door.

41:16.573 --> 41:17.573
Another door.

41:22.752 --> 41:25.408
You lot can have all the
quantum security you like.

41:25.433 --> 41:26.689
Since the power cuts,

41:26.713 --> 41:30.252
they've been printing stuff on
plain old paper and archiving it

41:30.855 --> 41:32.548
in room 157.

41:45.079 --> 41:47.588
Oh, my God! Do you even
recognise these things?

41:47.861 --> 41:50.415
- Filing cabinets.
- Seen them in films.

41:50.618 --> 41:51.766
Period dramas.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.837
16, 16, and 16.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.383
Ah, locked with a key.

41:58.732 --> 42:01.243
This is how we did
it in the old days.

42:05.727 --> 42:08.165
Slight & Weight
pays £500,000 a year

42:08.190 --> 42:10.258
for clinical support
to Yes Chain,

42:10.283 --> 42:12.045
and sitting on the
board of Yes Chain,

42:13.601 --> 42:16.444
- Vivienne Rook.
- Oh, I bet she is.

42:17.145 --> 42:18.145
Ah!

42:20.162 --> 42:23.122
Slight & Weight run
employment centres.

42:23.147 --> 42:26.583
They created 400 new
jobs, private security guards,

42:26.608 --> 42:28.857
overnight, 400 guards.

42:29.351 --> 42:30.481
What does that mean?

42:31.725 --> 42:33.083
They're guarding something.

42:34.101 --> 42:37.786
And I think the erstwhiles
are recorded in here.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.122
Security. They must have
changed the pattern. Sorry.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.068
They're about 90 seconds
away from your corridor.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.811
If you leave now, I can
get you out the way came.

42:48.835 --> 42:49.835
Aunt Edith!

42:50.233 --> 42:52.373
- Edith, can you hear me?
- Oh, yep.

42:52.591 --> 42:54.443
You all right? You
need to get out.

42:54.579 --> 42:56.595
Edith, what's wrong
with your breathing?

42:56.620 --> 42:57.620
Edith?

43:00.021 --> 43:01.567
Oh, my God, your heart rate!

43:01.592 --> 43:03.551
- Leave me alone.
- It's your lungs.

43:03.738 --> 43:06.410
The condition of your lungs.
This is Hong Sha, isn't it?

43:06.435 --> 43:08.996
I said so! You got
poisoned at Hong Sha,

43:09.021 --> 43:10.223
and it's worse than you said!

43:12.570 --> 43:13.918
Erstwhile...

43:15.276 --> 43:16.567
Oh, God!

43:18.273 --> 43:19.676
They're on your corridor!

43:21.999 --> 43:23.145
They're getting closer!

43:25.470 --> 43:28.506
Don't move! Edith!
Stay where you are!

43:30.307 --> 43:32.568
- <i>I can't find it.</i>
- They're two doors away!

43:33.819 --> 43:34.956
Oh, my God!

43:39.434 --> 43:40.988
It's in here somewhere.

43:57.275 --> 43:58.307
It's okay.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.659
They've gone.

44:04.011 --> 44:05.558
And your heart
rate's coming down.

44:06.295 --> 44:07.510
That's it.

44:10.112 --> 44:13.315
- Nice and easy.
- Thanks.

44:16.113 --> 44:17.244
How long have you known?

44:19.265 --> 44:22.158
- <i>Is that the radiation?</i>
- They say...

44:23.719 --> 44:25.002
the Chinese...

44:26.572 --> 44:28.869
<i>had all sorts of
stuff on Hong Sha.</i>

44:30.088 --> 44:31.556
I breathed it in.

44:33.052 --> 44:34.052
Okay.

44:34.877 --> 44:36.112
Just sit there.

44:36.564 --> 44:38.869
Get your breath back. We've
got all night to get you out.

44:41.860 --> 44:43.447
It was my fault.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.978
- Danny.
- Do you think?

44:49.266 --> 44:50.266
Look at me.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.511
Like I'm so clever.

44:56.173 --> 44:57.591
<i>I told them.</i>

44:58.168 --> 44:59.542
<i>The whole thing.</i>

45:00.195 --> 45:01.550
It's my fault.

45:02.433 --> 45:03.433
Well...

45:04.539 --> 45:07.883
- yeah.
- You can't say that.

45:09.209 --> 45:11.180
<i>Well, it was, slightly.</i>

45:11.305 --> 45:13.543
I mean, you know
what he was like.

45:13.703 --> 45:17.538
I loved him, Uncle Dan, but
he could be a bit full of himself.

45:19.518 --> 45:23.163
- Yeah, righteous...
- He'd never say it was your fault.

45:23.570 --> 45:26.631
Right at the end, he'd be
saying, "This is all about me."

45:27.542 --> 45:29.061
That's so him.

45:30.370 --> 45:31.370
Yeah.

45:32.564 --> 45:33.564
I miss him.

45:37.245 --> 45:38.356
Yeah, me too.

45:54.405 --> 45:57.365
Thanks very much.
Give him a tip.

46:10.293 --> 46:12.301
Have you seen?
It's Gerard Linstrum.

46:13.545 --> 46:16.076
You said the government was in
chaos. This looks like the opposite.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.325
All the better for us.

46:17.350 --> 46:19.771
So, the plan is, you listen,

46:19.796 --> 46:22.505
get me the assessment
and I make the bid.

46:23.009 --> 46:25.724
- I thought this was a think tank.
- It's an auction.

46:25.847 --> 46:26.987
You idiot.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.496
Jim! Woody!

46:30.521 --> 46:33.043
How's that father of yours?
Keeping out of trouble?

46:33.068 --> 46:35.731
Yeah, yeah. He leaves
that to me, the old bastard.

46:36.337 --> 46:37.793
Excuse me. Sorry.

47:02.214 --> 47:03.214
Not in your way?

47:03.668 --> 47:04.668
No.

47:06.995 --> 47:08.503
I didn't know...

47:09.324 --> 47:11.823
- No-one said that you were here.
- I'm not.

47:13.644 --> 47:14.987
I see, of course.

47:19.651 --> 47:20.941
You met my sister once.

47:21.401 --> 47:22.401
Did I?

47:23.080 --> 47:24.784
Well, you must meet
millions of people.

47:24.809 --> 47:26.050
Was I nice?

47:26.995 --> 47:29.237
Yeah. Yeah. You were lovely.

47:30.506 --> 47:31.776
She always goes on about it.

47:31.801 --> 47:33.441
- She was thrilled.
- Did she vote for me?

47:34.058 --> 47:36.338
Yeah, well, as a matter
of fact I think she did.

47:36.363 --> 47:37.363
Good.

47:38.510 --> 47:41.611
- Bloody papers.
- I know, yeah. Me, too.

47:43.005 --> 47:44.394
I thought we'd done
away with paperwork.

47:44.418 --> 47:45.698
It's like we're going backwards.

47:46.229 --> 47:47.846
You know, all because
of the Russians.

47:48.565 --> 47:49.947
Don't be so stupid.

47:49.972 --> 47:51.283
Nice to meet you.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.221
My brother died.

47:56.526 --> 47:58.072
He was from Manchester,

47:58.097 --> 47:59.915
and he was trying to
help these refugees.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.780
Well, they were technically
illegal immigrants.

48:01.898 --> 48:04.421
And he got on the boat with
them across the Channel.

48:04.703 --> 48:07.304
Really, really stupid thing
to do. Really, really stupid.

48:07.742 --> 48:11.022
And those boats, they
have this aluminium deck,

48:11.438 --> 48:13.474
and if you put too many
people on top of it...

48:14.810 --> 48:15.846
He drowned.

48:17.216 --> 48:19.232
So I'm, I'm taking
this seriously,

48:19.380 --> 48:22.544
these housing problems, and
I will do my very best to help.

48:23.161 --> 48:25.165
Was he brave or an idiot?

48:27.076 --> 48:29.569
I... I don't know.

48:31.850 --> 48:33.514
Well, if I could do it, I'd go.

48:33.873 --> 48:35.528
Sail away, far from all this.

48:35.553 --> 48:37.585
Just head for the
horizon and... gone.

48:38.856 --> 48:40.177
Imagine if I did.

48:41.581 --> 48:43.621
You're the Prime Minister,
you can do what you want.

48:45.482 --> 48:46.646
They'd kill me.

48:47.739 --> 48:48.767
Who would?

48:49.999 --> 48:51.427
They would have me killed.

49:00.034 --> 49:02.419
The difficulty is,
never mind refugees,

49:02.444 --> 49:04.575
we've got problems
with our own population.

49:04.976 --> 49:08.304
Floods and radiation, and we
predict another million homeless

49:08.313 --> 49:10.849
from coastal erosion
within the next five years.

49:10.874 --> 49:13.038
We need more
room. Simple as that.

49:14.371 --> 49:16.484
Now, we have a number

49:16.890 --> 49:20.201
of what we call
"erstwhile sites", so-called

49:20.226 --> 49:24.451
because this was an
erstwhile army base,

49:24.476 --> 49:26.295
this was formally
police training facility,

49:26.320 --> 49:28.420
this used to be a
hospital, now empty.

49:28.445 --> 49:31.912
We're using them as overflows,
but to be honest, we're full.

49:31.937 --> 49:34.404
And we can't expand. And
that's where we come to you.

49:34.429 --> 49:37.194
Now, bear in mind that anything
can be said within these walls.

49:37.219 --> 49:38.436
No consequences.

49:38.461 --> 49:41.731
If we were to hand these
camps over to you for governance,

49:41.756 --> 49:44.615
- how would you cope?
- Little problem, Jane.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.629
Excuse me. Tiny detail.

49:46.654 --> 49:49.287
Not everyone approves
of the word "camps".

49:49.312 --> 49:50.326
I'm sorry.

49:50.998 --> 49:55.005
- Facilities.
- "Camps" have negative connotations.

49:55.714 --> 49:59.169
The erstwhile sites are being kept
off the record in case people get

49:59.194 --> 50:02.044
upset, although personally I think
the public are more stoic than that.

50:02.537 --> 50:04.561
As Victoria Wood once
said, "The British would only

50:04.586 --> 50:07.325
have a revolution if they
changed the laws on caravanning."

50:09.919 --> 50:12.122
But let's look at the words,
Let's stare them down.

50:12.147 --> 50:15.107
The word "concentration"
simply means a concentration...

50:15.132 --> 50:16.451
of anything.

50:16.476 --> 50:18.092
You can fill a camp
full of oranges,

50:18.117 --> 50:19.739
it'd be a concentration
camp by dint

50:19.764 --> 50:22.381
of the oranges being
concentrated, simple as that one.

50:22.406 --> 50:24.148
Made it sound rather tasty.

50:24.889 --> 50:28.053
The notion of a concentration
camp goes way back

50:28.078 --> 50:30.036
to the 19th century,
the Boer War.

50:30.345 --> 50:33.599
They were British inventions,
built in South Africa,

50:33.865 --> 50:35.662
to house the men,
women and children

50:35.687 --> 50:37.428
made homeless by
the conflict, refugees.

50:37.453 --> 50:39.795
You see, everything
is much older...

50:40.077 --> 50:43.304
than we think, and
everything old happens again.

50:43.329 --> 50:44.732
Anyway, I'm sorry,
I'm interrupting.

50:44.756 --> 50:46.841
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- I'll let you get on.

50:47.126 --> 50:50.810
But, actually, it is worth
pointing out, when we consider...

50:50.835 --> 50:53.544
these erstwhile sites and
how to make them work,

50:53.653 --> 50:56.169
they will never stop filling up.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.723
Never. Absolutely never.

50:58.748 --> 51:00.622
These problems
will never go away.

51:00.647 --> 51:03.380
I can see the vast
migration of people stretching

51:03.405 --> 51:04.605
ahead for centuries.

51:04.836 --> 51:08.222
So, what if we look
back through history?

51:08.247 --> 51:09.514
Because the British

51:09.539 --> 51:13.511
found a way to empty
those camps in South Africa,

51:13.536 --> 51:14.801
all those years ago.

51:15.340 --> 51:19.352
They simply let
nature take its course.

51:19.641 --> 51:20.816
The camps were crowded,

51:20.841 --> 51:23.176
they were pestilent, they
were noxious, they were rife

51:23.201 --> 51:25.590
with disease, which was
on the one hand regrettable,

51:25.615 --> 51:26.764
and on the other hand...

51:27.019 --> 51:31.716
fitting, because a natural
selection process took place,

51:31.741 --> 51:35.263
and the population of
the camps controlled itself.

51:36.171 --> 51:40.012
You might call it neglect,
you might call it efficient.

51:40.326 --> 51:42.480
And it was Kitchener
who did this.

51:42.771 --> 51:44.811
Kitchener. "Your
country needs you."

51:46.051 --> 51:48.839
And let's say another word,
because some people call

51:48.840 --> 51:50.090
this policy genocide.

51:50.335 --> 51:52.752
But... have you
ever heard of it?

51:53.096 --> 51:55.041
The camps, the
Boers, the result.

51:55.574 --> 51:59.588
Have you? Have you read
about it? Were you taught it?

51:59.994 --> 52:02.760
- Do we remember it?
- No.

52:03.085 --> 52:06.526
We forget it, because it worked.

52:09.167 --> 52:11.612
I've said enough.
Thank you. Thank you.

52:18.745 --> 52:20.854
We did it, we did it, we did it!

52:20.855 --> 52:23.486
- Yes!
- But, so, what did we get?

52:23.511 --> 52:25.126
Two of the erstwhile sites.

52:25.151 --> 52:27.306
- What, we're running them?
- Fuck that!

52:27.331 --> 52:30.259
They're death traps! I'm
not touching any of that shit.

52:30.284 --> 52:31.595
We're just property management.

52:31.620 --> 52:33.306
We maintain the bricks and more.

52:33.331 --> 52:35.478
They can do what
they want inside them.

52:35.861 --> 52:37.819
- Who got chosen?!
- We got chosen!

52:37.843 --> 52:39.978
- Who got chosen?!
- We got chosen!

52:40.003 --> 52:42.118
- Who got chosen?!
- We got chosen!

52:44.663 --> 52:45.861
Good man, Steve.

52:53.993 --> 52:55.989
<i>Open transfer protocols.</i>

53:01.645 --> 53:03.250

54:50.440 --> 54:52.013
Right, guys, should
we just have a...

54:52.046 --> 54:53.972
quick toast before
we go outside?

54:53.997 --> 54:55.763
A little toast to Danny.

54:57.122 --> 54:58.700
To Danny.

54:59.045 --> 55:00.419
Oh, Danny.

55:01.165 --> 55:03.419
I remember when you were born.

55:04.275 --> 55:06.342
And when you
took your first step.

55:08.669 --> 55:12.137
And when you confessed
and came out to me...

55:13.318 --> 55:15.504
like you thought I didn't know.

55:48.445 --> 55:49.456
I warned you...

56:06.120 --> 56:08.331
<i>Select Viktor Goraya.</i>

56:17.768 --> 56:19.772
<i>Transfer Viktor Goraya.</i>

56:21.111 --> 56:23.713

Erstwhile Site Four.</i>

56:31.100 --> 56:32.330
<i>Confirm?</i>

56:37.793 --> 56:40.025
Erstwhile sites
are like tar pits.

56:40.252 --> 56:42.268
You get thrown in
and you disappear.

56:50.658 --> 56:52.682
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

57:34.353 --> 57:36.922
This is the world we built.

57:36.947 --> 57:38.516
My family will find me.

57:38.541 --> 57:41.102
- Fake news.
- To start a war.

57:41.127 --> 57:42.633
Declaring independence.

57:42.658 --> 57:43.953
Tear the fence down.

57:44.066 --> 57:45.468
It's killing him!

57:48.234 --> 57:49.508
<i>Who's watching you?!</i>

57:49.533 --> 57:51.961
Congratulations. Cheers, all.
