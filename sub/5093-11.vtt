What?

00:15.232 --> 00:17.499
It's our good deed
for the day, all right?

00:17.501 --> 00:20.252
Slow your roll, bro.
I got it.

00:21.871 --> 00:23.404
All right.
Thank you.

00:23.406 --> 00:24.190
You're welcome.

00:24.215 --> 00:26.092
I swear, when I asked
for directions,

00:26.093 --> 00:27.876
I never expected a ride.

00:27.878 --> 00:29.410
Or a guided tour, I bet.

00:29.412 --> 00:31.013
Well, it was our pleasure.
It really was.

00:31.014 --> 00:34.015
I hope you enjoy the rest
of your stay in New York.

00:34.017 --> 00:36.218
Now, if you need
anything--

00:36.220 --> 00:38.186
that's anything--
just call me, okay?

00:38.188 --> 00:40.388
And they say
New Yorkers are so rude.

00:40.390 --> 00:41.806
Crazy.
You guys are awesome.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.258
Thank you. Bye.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.260
Bye.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.095
Ooh.

00:47.097 --> 00:49.397
Officer Sweetie Pie, are
you ready to get back to work?

00:49.399 --> 00:51.700
No. I'm starving.

00:51.702 --> 00:53.935
There's this great Japanese fusion place
right up the street.

00:53.937 --> 00:56.871
Put us out for lunch.
You just used up our entire meal period.

00:56.873 --> 01:00.041
One Charles on the air,
be advised you have a 911 call

01:00.043 --> 01:02.377
of a man with a gun
in Washington Square Park.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.629
Male white, 30s,
wearing a gray suit and tie,

01:04.631 --> 01:06.464
dark hair.
Let's do it.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.049
I'm really
starving.

01:08.051 --> 01:09.551
That's karma, bro.

01:10.836 --> 01:13.421
I'm really hungry.

01:20.646 --> 01:24.416
I'm not sure where that middle
ground would be, Councilman.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.135
You see a 12-hour workday
creating economies;

01:27.137 --> 01:33.474
I see 34,000 tired cops unable
to perform at their optimum.

01:33.476 --> 01:35.827
Likewise.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.478
Sorry.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.981
No, I'm sorry;
I know you're busy.

01:39.983 --> 01:42.150
Not for you.

01:42.152 --> 01:45.337
How the hell
do I handle your boss?

01:46.989 --> 01:49.591
The mayor didn't behave himself
in court today?

01:49.593 --> 01:51.993
His campaign consultant

01:51.995 --> 01:54.179
embezzles a quarter
of a million dollars

01:54.181 --> 01:55.547
from his reelection fund.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.216
The mayor is my star witness,
and he's a no-show.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.101
Did he say why?

02:00.103 --> 02:02.003
Urgent city business.

02:02.005 --> 02:03.722
We've been known to have that.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.342
If it was that urgent,
you would have known about it.

02:08.610 --> 02:12.897
It sounds like he didn't want
to be questioned under oath.

02:12.899 --> 02:13.815
Yeah.

02:13.817 --> 02:15.567
What's that tell you?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.852
That there's something
he's not telling me.

02:17.854 --> 02:19.571
If he refuses

02:19.573 --> 02:21.122
to testify...

02:21.124 --> 02:22.324
You have subpoena power.

02:22.326 --> 02:24.376
Subpoena <i>our</i> mutual boss?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.027
Talk about a lose-lose.

02:26.029 --> 02:29.798
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena,

02:29.800 --> 02:34.252
who, at worst, if he fails...
fails while daring greatly.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.037
Nice words.

02:36.039 --> 02:38.890
They're not mine, they're
Commissioner Roosevelt's.

02:43.712 --> 02:45.380
Nobody seems too concerned

02:45.382 --> 02:47.399
about a crazed gunman
on the loose.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.567
Which way?

02:49.569 --> 02:51.853
To lunch,

02:51.855 --> 02:53.905

Come on.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.174
Fine.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.826
You go right;
I'll go left.

02:57.828 --> 02:59.394
Not a good idea.

Hey, twice the ground,

Show me your hands.

Here's my hands.
Hey, drop the gun!

Drop the gun right now!

Confiscate my gun,
run ballistics,

make sure everything's

Ah, you know,

I couldn't resist
this view of the arch.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.927
Nice view.
Yeah. Well, you know who else

06:33.929 --> 06:36.279
isn't gonna be able to resist it?
The media?

06:36.281 --> 06:37.697
That's right.
Sharp as a tack, Sid.

06:37.699 --> 06:39.699
The press is gonna have
a field day with this.

06:39.701 --> 06:41.368
Well, I guess I better
get to work, then.

06:41.370 --> 06:42.869
Yeah. What's
this thug's story?

06:42.871 --> 06:43.954
How big a hero is

06:43.956 --> 06:45.271
my kid brother for
taking him out?

06:45.273 --> 06:47.541
Name is Gavin Bryant.
Swanky address.

06:47.543 --> 06:49.108
Well, crime pays.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.827
No criminal record.
Really?

06:50.829 --> 06:53.880
Well, I don't think his gun
shoots gumdrops and lollipops.

06:53.882 --> 06:55.332
Well, he had
a fully loaded magazine,

06:55.334 --> 06:57.784
but nothing in the chamber;
gun is clean as a whistle.

06:57.786 --> 06:59.452
Doesn't look like
it's been fired recently.

06:59.454 --> 07:01.054
Well, just because
he didn't fire it

07:01.056 --> 07:03.122
doesn't he didn't use it
to commit a crime.

07:03.124 --> 07:05.642
Check the SPRINT System for
other 911 calls in the area?

07:05.644 --> 07:07.177
Oh, thanks for the tip,
Danny--

07:07.179 --> 07:08.678
I only been
a detective ten years.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.013
I checked; nothing popped.

07:10.015 --> 07:11.565
All right, can you
just keep looking?

07:11.567 --> 07:13.767
This is my kid brother
we're talking about here, all right?

07:13.769 --> 07:16.469
This guy drew down on a cop;
there's no way he's clean.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.305
Thanks.

07:19.307 --> 07:22.308
And thanks to the
cooperation of the neighborhood,

07:22.310 --> 07:24.694
all the looters
were apprehended.

07:24.696 --> 07:26.279
Questions?

07:26.281 --> 07:27.781
Commissioner,

07:27.783 --> 07:30.450
any update on the Washington
Square Park shooting?

07:30.452 --> 07:31.751
Thank you, Helen.

07:31.753 --> 07:33.787
That was my next item.

07:33.789 --> 07:37.457
The gunman, Gavin Bryant,
was gainfully employed

07:37.459 --> 07:39.209
as a corporate headhunter.

07:39.211 --> 07:41.444
Married with
two young children,

07:41.446 --> 07:43.096
active in his church.

07:43.098 --> 07:44.264
The neighbors and coworkers

07:44.266 --> 07:45.815
that we've spoken to
expressed shock.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.500
None of them
saw this coming.

07:47.502 --> 07:49.853
His motive is
not yet known,

07:49.855 --> 07:52.138
but the investigation
is still ongoing.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.391
Were any civilians injured
in the crossfire?

07:54.393 --> 07:55.392
Not one.

07:55.394 --> 07:57.060
Miraculous, given
the size of the crowd.

07:57.062 --> 07:58.612
Commissioner,
can you confirm the rumor

07:58.614 --> 08:00.780
that the officer involved
is your son?

08:02.283 --> 08:05.235
I understand the gunman
didn't fire a single shot.

08:05.237 --> 08:07.420
Why didn't your son
just Taser him?

08:07.422 --> 08:09.789
Well, first of all,
Jonathan,

08:09.791 --> 08:12.492
uniform officers
do not carry CED's.

08:12.494 --> 08:13.576
Well, maybe they should.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.629
So is this the NYPD's
official policy

08:15.631 --> 08:17.547
for dealing
with the mentally ill?

08:17.549 --> 08:18.965
The gunman had no history of...

08:18.967 --> 08:20.583
That was unknowable.

08:20.585 --> 08:21.534
He was a man

08:21.536 --> 08:23.253
with a gun,
and lives were at stake.

08:23.255 --> 08:26.890
Did your son even try to...
shoot the gun out of his hand?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.644
The officer in question

08:30.646 --> 08:33.013
was adhering
to department policy,

08:33.015 --> 08:35.548
that is, to use
deadly physical force

08:35.549 --> 08:37.717
when the situation
requires,

08:37.719 --> 08:39.736
which it did in this instance.

08:39.738 --> 08:42.355
And all my officers
are trained to shoot

08:42.357 --> 08:45.659
until the threat
is eliminated, not to kill.

08:45.661 --> 08:48.995
So the problem was
your son is too good a shot.

08:48.997 --> 08:51.230
All right.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.668
Let's just say...

08:54.670 --> 08:57.704
that the gunman wasn't aiming
at a group of schoolchildren,

08:57.706 --> 08:59.839
but at you--
you have a second

08:59.841 --> 09:02.342
before he pulls the trigger.
What do you do?

09:02.344 --> 09:03.927
Well, first of all...

09:03.929 --> 09:04.961
Too late. You're dead.

09:07.082 --> 09:09.082
Uh, to be clear,
the commissioner

09:09.084 --> 09:11.250
was speaking hypothetically.

09:21.095 --> 09:23.229
So, do I get to see
the doc anytime soon?

09:23.231 --> 09:25.615
Danny led me to believe you
had some pull around here.

09:25.617 --> 09:28.084
You need to be quiet
while I get a reading, okay?

09:28.086 --> 09:31.270
You know, the doc'll be in
as soon as I check your vitals.

09:35.543 --> 09:38.044
Okay.

09:38.046 --> 09:40.130
So, how you feeling?

09:40.132 --> 09:41.280
Fine.

09:41.282 --> 09:42.448
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.751
Well, your blood pressure
says differently.

09:44.753 --> 09:46.169
It's through the roof.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.504
Yeah, that's on account
of this ringing

09:47.506 --> 09:48.922
in my ear--
it's a little annoying.

09:48.924 --> 09:50.757
That start after the shooting?

09:50.759 --> 09:52.959
Yeah.

09:52.961 --> 09:54.794
Well, that's tinnitus.

09:54.796 --> 09:56.629
That's common with gunshots.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.181
I'm not imagining it.

09:58.183 --> 10:00.984
No, I didn't say
you were imagining it.

10:00.986 --> 10:03.403
I'm just saying that...
you don't need to worry,

10:03.405 --> 10:05.071
it'll go away on its own.

10:05.073 --> 10:08.074
Then this was all
a waste of time, right?

10:08.076 --> 10:09.075
No, it's not...

10:09.077 --> 10:11.494
Sit down, I'm not done with you.

10:11.496 --> 10:13.479
You know what,
what you went through

10:13.481 --> 10:14.781
was a traumatic thing.

10:14.783 --> 10:17.617
For anyone.
Look at me.

10:17.619 --> 10:19.869
Danny's been involved
in shootings; more than one.

10:19.871 --> 10:21.621
Does he usually get
this pity party?

10:21.623 --> 10:23.123
This is not a pity party, Jamie.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.425
And you know what,
if you think all that stuff

10:25.427 --> 10:27.043
doesn't bother
your big macho brother,

10:27.045 --> 10:28.494
then you don't know him.

10:28.496 --> 10:29.712
I did what I was trained to do.

10:29.714 --> 10:30.997
I'm not gonna
fall apart over it.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.882
Good.

10:32.884 --> 10:34.267
You know, Jamie...

10:34.269 --> 10:36.936
people in these situations,

10:36.938 --> 10:39.389
they tend to cycle
through what looks like

10:39.391 --> 10:40.640
the five stages of grief.

10:40.642 --> 10:42.192
There's denial,

10:42.194 --> 10:45.311
anger, bargaining,
depression...

10:45.313 --> 10:47.513
Yeah, he was gonna shoot
some kids, Lin, so...

10:47.515 --> 10:49.532
I'm not gonna grieve
over this guy.

10:49.534 --> 10:50.850
That's not what I was saying.

10:50.852 --> 10:52.702
You know what would help me?
What's that?

10:52.704 --> 10:54.954
If you could just go
and get the doc,

10:54.956 --> 10:57.323
so that I could
get this over with.

10:57.325 --> 10:59.492
Okay.

11:05.199 --> 11:06.716
<i>I got ten witnesses</i>

11:06.718 --> 11:09.469
saw you bash this guy's
head in with a pool cue.

11:09.471 --> 11:11.671
There's no upside
to you clamming up now.

11:11.673 --> 11:14.307
What part of my Miranda
rights do you not understand?

11:14.309 --> 11:15.541
Yes!

11:15.543 --> 11:17.594
It's me. Can you talk?

11:17.596 --> 11:18.711
Hold on.

11:18.713 --> 11:20.346
You still asserting
your right to remain silent?

11:20.348 --> 11:21.981
Yeah.
Good, enjoy your stay, psycho.

11:21.983 --> 11:24.050
Excuse me?
No, not you.

11:24.052 --> 11:25.768
What is it?

11:25.770 --> 11:27.403
It's your brother.

11:27.405 --> 11:28.605
You saw him, right?

11:28.607 --> 11:29.823
Yeah, he's good.

11:29.825 --> 11:31.040
Exactly.

11:31.042 --> 11:32.826
Why is good bad, Linda?

11:32.828 --> 11:35.411
He's not processing this
in a healthy way.

11:35.413 --> 11:36.863
He's in denial.

11:36.865 --> 11:38.364
Whoa, slow down, okay?

11:38.366 --> 11:40.366
This just happened;
he's probably still in shock.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.452
Believe me, when it hits him,
he's gonna feel it.

11:42.454 --> 11:44.087
Yeah, well,
now they're talking on the news

11:44.089 --> 11:45.839
like the gunman
is this good guy.

11:45.841 --> 11:47.207
I mean, that can't be helping.

11:47.209 --> 11:49.125
Babe, I'm telling you,
everything's gonna be fine.

11:49.127 --> 11:50.460
Look, I got to go.

11:50.462 --> 11:52.295
All right, love you.

11:53.915 --> 11:56.099
Love you more.

11:58.435 --> 11:59.686
What brings you
down here, Sid?

11:59.688 --> 12:00.920
A courtesy call.

12:00.922 --> 12:02.922
I thought you might want
to give your brother a heads-up

12:02.924 --> 12:04.057
before this hit the news.

12:04.059 --> 12:05.091
Heads-up about what?

12:05.093 --> 12:06.425
My brother didn't do
anything off-base.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.978
He didn't, but the case
took a bit of a weird turn.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.314
Well, are you
gonna make me guess?

12:11.316 --> 12:13.149
They pulled
the initial 911 call.

12:13.151 --> 12:15.702
Caller hung up
without giving his name.

12:15.704 --> 12:17.570
And you did a reverse look-up.

12:17.572 --> 12:18.988
Okay, I knew there
was more to this.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.406
So what? The caller's got

12:20.408 --> 12:21.708
a connection to Gavin Bryant?

12:21.710 --> 12:25.378
You might say that.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.563
What the hell, Danny?

12:43.565 --> 12:46.232
I have to take out a
restraining order against you?

12:46.234 --> 12:47.984
How you doing, kid?

12:47.986 --> 12:50.653
All right till I saw the sour
look on your face. What's up?

12:50.655 --> 12:54.657
They tracked down the guy who
made the initial 911 call.

12:54.659 --> 12:57.777
The one I responded to, yeah?

12:57.779 --> 13:01.147
Yeah. The call came
from Gavin Bryant's cell phone.

13:01.149 --> 13:04.667
He made the call himself.

13:04.669 --> 13:06.452
That's impossible.

13:06.454 --> 13:08.654
He didn't have a phone on him
when I shot him.

13:08.656 --> 13:10.656
I know he didn't, but we checked

13:10.658 --> 13:12.658
the security footage
in the park.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.878
We got Gavin chucking
his cell phone in the trash

13:15.880 --> 13:18.181
seconds after the 911 call
was logged.

13:18.183 --> 13:19.665
Why would he report himself?

13:19.667 --> 13:20.800
I don't...

13:20.802 --> 13:21.935
A guy in his state of mind,

13:21.937 --> 13:23.219
there's no telling
what he was thinking.

13:23.221 --> 13:24.270
What are you
talking about, Danny?

13:24.272 --> 13:25.355
What state of mind
was he in?

13:25.357 --> 13:26.522
It looks like

13:26.524 --> 13:28.808
he committed suicide... by cop.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.396
Suicide?

13:35.566 --> 13:38.851
I'm the sucker that he conned
into doing it for him.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.431
Yes?
Mrs. Bryant?

14:01.433 --> 14:03.834
No. I'll let her
know you're here.

14:03.836 --> 14:05.035
Your name?

14:05.037 --> 14:06.436
Jamie.

14:06.438 --> 14:08.138
Officer Jamie Reagan.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.107
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:11.109 --> 14:12.576
Connie.

14:13.277 --> 14:14.811
Let him in.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.366
Alex, honey,

14:19.368 --> 14:21.535
I'm gonna need you to look
after your little sister

14:21.537 --> 14:23.153
for a while, okay?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.909
We can talk in here.

14:34.382 --> 14:36.583
Thank you.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.670
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.422
Tell me why it happened.

14:42.424 --> 14:45.041
Why did you kill my husband?

14:45.043 --> 14:48.711
I wish I could make
some sense of it for you.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.730
Our marriage was solid.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.315
His business was never better.

14:52.317 --> 14:53.984
He was not suicidal.

14:53.986 --> 14:56.353
Your husband was distraught.

14:57.488 --> 14:59.155
Had he been drinking?

14:59.157 --> 15:01.157
He was 15 years sober.

15:01.159 --> 15:03.360
Had something happened recently?

15:03.362 --> 15:04.945
Why was he...

15:04.947 --> 15:07.230
Why was he carrying a gun?

15:07.232 --> 15:10.083
He did volunteer work
a few weeks ago

15:10.085 --> 15:12.502
in a sketchy neighborhood.

15:12.504 --> 15:14.237
Maybe he had it for protection.

15:14.239 --> 15:15.672
Had someone threatened him?

15:15.674 --> 15:17.407
Stop.

15:17.409 --> 15:20.126
I thought you came here
to help me understand.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.096
You just want answers
for yourself.

15:23.098 --> 15:26.082
The last thing I meant to do
was upset you more.

15:26.084 --> 15:29.085
You came here expecting me
to say my husband was a monster

15:29.087 --> 15:30.937
so you could feel better

15:30.939 --> 15:32.055
about killing him.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.558
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll go.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.562
You killed a wonderful husband
and father.

15:39.614 --> 15:41.147
You have no idea

15:41.149 --> 15:42.782
what you took from me.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.078
Erin, you're still here.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.463
Your tenacity is
one of the things

15:56.465 --> 15:58.448
I admire most about you,
but I'm late for dinner.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.617
Why were you afraid to testify?

16:02.786 --> 16:04.838
Why don't we talk over here?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.289
You're my key witness.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.841
The jury's already
been sworn in.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.627
If you don't show up tomorrow,
double jeopardy attaches.

16:10.629 --> 16:12.262
Ryan walks free.

16:13.731 --> 16:17.317
Tell me that is not your plan.

16:17.319 --> 16:20.270
Erin, this is very complicated,

16:20.272 --> 16:22.739
and it's an election year
for me.

16:22.741 --> 16:26.976
So it's not a good time for you
to answer questions under oath?

16:26.978 --> 16:29.195
Not that I have
anything to hide.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.831
But my sources say
that the defense plans

16:31.833 --> 16:33.333
to turn this whole thing on me.

16:33.335 --> 16:34.250
How?

16:34.252 --> 16:35.418
By claiming that the money

16:35.420 --> 16:37.787
that Ryan took was
an under-the-table payoff

16:37.789 --> 16:39.089
to implement voter fraud.

16:39.091 --> 16:40.490
Is there anything to that?

16:40.492 --> 16:42.008
Erin, how could you ask me that?

16:42.010 --> 16:44.794
Look, I can protect you
in court,

16:44.796 --> 16:46.162
but you need to tell me anything

16:46.164 --> 16:48.598
they can throw at you,
so I can get ahead of it.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.017
Well, Erin, you can ask me
anything you like.

16:51.019 --> 16:53.103
I have nothing to hide.

16:57.008 --> 16:59.359
It's not the time for you
be ducking me, kid.

16:59.361 --> 17:01.778
In case you forgot, I'm the
only brother you got.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.012
I need you to leave me alone
right now, Danny.

17:04.015 --> 17:05.648
Come on, I thought
we went over this already.

17:05.651 --> 17:08.117
Hey, what's going on with you?

17:11.238 --> 17:12.521
Huh?

17:12.523 --> 17:14.624
The widow said that
Gavin was sober 15 years,

17:14.626 --> 17:16.710
but he seemed drunk or
high or something to me.

17:16.712 --> 17:18.411
Yeah, that's what's going on
with the case.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.996
I said what's going on
with you?

17:19.998 --> 17:21.548
You really want to know?
Yeah.

17:21.550 --> 17:22.999
I-I'm angry and I'm frustrated.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.001
I'm not sure I'm fit
to be a cop anymore.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.003
Oh, come on, you're as fit
to be a cop as any cop I know.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.473
What if the next time,
because of how this went down,

17:30.475 --> 17:33.893
I hesitate and an innocent
bystander gets killed?

17:33.895 --> 17:35.228
You won't let that happen.

17:35.230 --> 17:36.730
You don't know that.

17:36.732 --> 17:38.231
Yes, I do.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.233
Look, it was a clean shoot.

17:40.235 --> 17:42.769
Hey.

17:45.156 --> 17:47.107
Look, I've been
where you are, okay?

17:47.109 --> 17:50.026
It's the unanswered questions
that are driving you nuts.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.945
Well, we're not getting
any more answers, are we?

17:51.947 --> 17:53.580
Says who?

17:53.582 --> 17:56.282
It's already been ruled
a justifiable homicide.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.667
The investigation is over.

17:57.669 --> 17:59.586
NYPD doesn't care
why a guy killed himself.

17:59.588 --> 18:01.204
Okay, well,
that's all the more reason

18:01.206 --> 18:02.839
someone should get
to the bottom of it.

18:02.841 --> 18:04.124
Yeah, well, I'm
stuck behind a desk.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.291
I'd do something, but I can't.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.910
Maybe you can't, but I can.

18:09.096 --> 18:11.464
I got some personal time.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.551
Let me take a few days and do
some sniffing around, all right?

18:14.553 --> 18:16.136
Yeah?

18:16.138 --> 18:17.637
Yeah.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.308
Okay, do it.

18:27.866 --> 18:30.066
Detective Reagan,

18:30.068 --> 18:32.118
you just missed
the Bryant autopsy.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.653
Yeah, well,
never really interested

18:33.655 --> 18:34.821
in seeing the actual autopsy.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.489
Just interested
in seeing the results.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.991
Mm.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.276
What happened? This guy have
a terminal illness or something?

18:40.278 --> 18:41.995
Aside from
the hemorrhagic wound track

18:41.997 --> 18:44.414
through the cardiac ventricle,
he was a fit specimen.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.948
So nothing was out of place.

18:45.950 --> 18:49.085
Just the proximal phalanx
of his fifth phalange.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.720
What?

18:50.722 --> 18:52.789
He had a fractured pinky finger.

18:52.791 --> 18:54.140
Really?

18:54.142 --> 18:56.726
Consistent like with, uh,
somebody breaking it?

18:56.728 --> 18:58.094
Like somebody he owed money to?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.647
More consistent with him
having thrown a punch.

19:00.649 --> 19:03.650
All right,
what about the tox screen?

19:03.652 --> 19:05.018
Anything show up there?

19:05.020 --> 19:09.072
Uh, his blood alcohol was .07.

19:09.074 --> 19:10.690
.07?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.408
The widow said
he was on the wagon.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.611
Guess he had one for the road.

19:27.157 --> 19:29.876
Here I am; don't know why.

19:32.663 --> 19:35.832
Well, I wasn't about to have you
up to the 14th floor.

19:35.834 --> 19:38.318
There's some coffee
there, if you want it.

19:42.690 --> 19:44.557
So how you holding up?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.476
Okay.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.030
Really?

19:51.032 --> 19:52.398
You sign up for the job,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.317
you know you might have
to shoot someone.

19:56.036 --> 19:58.905
95% of the cops go
their whole career

19:58.907 --> 20:01.574
without firing their weapon
outside the range.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.393
Of the five percent
that are left,

20:03.395 --> 20:06.045
how many shot first
and killed the guy?

20:06.047 --> 20:08.281
That I do not know.

20:14.054 --> 20:16.890
A while ago,
we had that bad shooting.

20:16.892 --> 20:19.142
A woman lost her son.

20:19.144 --> 20:21.010
He didn't do anything wrong.

20:21.012 --> 20:24.380
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.685
I went to see her.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.188
I wanted her to know
that I understood

20:32.190 --> 20:34.390
what it was like
to lose a child.

20:36.827 --> 20:39.746
It was a mistake.

20:39.748 --> 20:41.915
It didn't help.

20:43.751 --> 20:46.452
With time, I've come to realize

20:46.454 --> 20:49.238
that it was, well,

20:49.240 --> 20:52.909
more for my own consolation
than hers.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.746
Two things.

20:56.748 --> 20:58.932
This wasn't a bad shooting,

20:58.934 --> 21:01.301
and it was a mistake
to go see that woman.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.687
What was I supposed to do?

21:04.689 --> 21:07.590
You didn't think to notify
the department or run it

21:07.592 --> 21:09.309
by your PBA attorney?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.260
I'm responsible...

21:11.262 --> 21:14.447
for her husband's death.

21:14.449 --> 21:18.201
You're also responsible
for the lives he didn't take.

21:19.203 --> 21:21.621
Don't make this any harder
on yourself

21:21.623 --> 21:22.989
than it already is.

21:22.991 --> 21:27.243
That's easier said than done.

21:30.464 --> 21:32.448
Listen...

21:34.302 --> 21:36.285
There's nothing
you're going through,

21:36.287 --> 21:38.421
no mistake you can make,

21:38.423 --> 21:41.975
that I haven't already
been there, done that.

21:44.428 --> 21:49.015
And I know you're not hearing
too well right now,

21:49.017 --> 21:53.903
but don't try
to carry this alone.

21:53.905 --> 21:56.839
It's a fool's errand,

21:56.841 --> 21:58.358
and you're anything but.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.755
You worked with him for nine
years-- you have any idea

22:12.757 --> 22:14.490
what might've lead to him
falling off the wagon?

22:14.492 --> 22:16.759
It never happened, and this
is a high-stress business.

22:16.761 --> 22:18.461
Oh, yeah-- exactly
what is it that

22:18.463 --> 22:20.430
a, uh, corporate
headhunter does, anyway?

22:20.432 --> 22:24.000
Mr. Bryant was retained by
several Fortune 500 companies

22:24.002 --> 22:27.303
to recruit high-level
executives for them.

22:27.305 --> 22:30.723
In this economy, he's paid
to find people willing to work?

22:30.725 --> 22:33.643
33% of the hire's
first-year income.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.728
So maybe he did have something
to live for anyway.

22:35.730 --> 22:36.863
He was a good man.

22:36.865 --> 22:39.015
Yeah, well, he was
a good man but he punched

22:39.017 --> 22:40.450
someone in the face recently.

22:40.452 --> 22:41.834
Any of his rival
headhunters show up

22:41.836 --> 22:43.569
with a black eye or a fat lip?

22:43.571 --> 22:45.621
Mr. Bryant was never violent.

22:45.623 --> 22:47.240
He broke his pinky on somebody.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.459
That happened somehow
at Job Fair.

22:49.461 --> 22:50.793
What is Job Fair?

22:52.247 --> 22:53.963
They teach interview skills.

22:53.965 --> 22:56.666
Match up prospective employers
with the down-on-their-luck.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.085
Mr. Bryant taught
a seminar two weeks ago.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.837
Right, and he came back
from that seminar

23:00.839 --> 23:02.388
with a broken pinky.

23:03.974 --> 23:06.809
Any other fallout from this
event that you know of?

23:06.811 --> 23:10.713
One of the participants
showed up here.

23:10.715 --> 23:13.399
Mr. Bryant didn't seem too happy
about it, but he did see him.

23:13.401 --> 23:15.217
Uh-huh.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.237
And?

23:18.239 --> 23:21.157
The gentleman had a black eye.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.326
He had a black...

23:23.328 --> 23:25.445
I'm gonna need
the guy's contact info.

23:29.066 --> 23:32.485
He called several times.

23:33.403 --> 23:37.206
Tyler Greene--
no call-back number.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.009
Right, on account of
he was down on his luck.

23:41.261 --> 23:44.080
Write the name down, please.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.267
Gavin's seminar was a fiasco.

23:48.269 --> 23:49.886
Worst case
of flop-sweats ever.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.021
Any, uh, feedback
from the audience?

23:52.023 --> 23:53.639
Specifically from
a Tyler Greene?

23:53.641 --> 23:56.225
Well, I had wondered if that's
what made Gavin so nervous,

23:56.227 --> 23:58.227
having his old roommate
in the front row.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.312
Back up.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.530
When were Gavin the big shot

24:00.532 --> 24:02.431
and Tyler Greene
the homeless guy roommates?

24:02.433 --> 24:04.450
His freshman year MIT.

24:04.452 --> 24:05.985
Tyler went to MIT?

24:05.987 --> 24:07.403
Yeah, at least that's
what Tyler told me

24:07.405 --> 24:09.072
when I posted Gavin's flyer.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.773
What else you know about
this Tyler Greene?

24:10.775 --> 24:12.625
He's a former drug addict
who showed up this year

24:12.627 --> 24:14.293
clean and sober, determined
to turn his life around.

24:14.295 --> 24:16.996
Okay. You know how I can get
in touch with this guy?

24:16.998 --> 24:18.081
Yeah, he's, uh...

24:18.083 --> 24:19.799
he's right over there.

24:21.618 --> 24:25.788
Let me guess-- the guy
with the two-week-old shiner.

24:42.823 --> 24:43.973
Hey.

24:43.975 --> 24:45.658
Tyler Greene.
I didn't do anything.

24:45.660 --> 24:48.494
Hey, take it easy,
take it easy.

24:48.496 --> 24:50.363
If I was gonna arrest you,
I would've done it already.

24:50.365 --> 24:51.747
Relax.

24:51.749 --> 24:52.915
Anything on you?

24:52.917 --> 24:55.151
Any needles or anything sharp?
No.

24:55.153 --> 24:57.420
Need to ask you some questions
about your ex-roommate.

24:57.422 --> 24:58.371
Turn around.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.839
I have nothing
to do with that.

24:59.841 --> 25:01.290
Really?

25:01.292 --> 25:03.709
You had nothing
to do with what?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.795
With what pushed
Gavin over the edge?

25:05.797 --> 25:07.346
I hadn't seen him
since college.

25:07.348 --> 25:08.664
So what is your
fraternity handshake--

25:08.666 --> 25:09.982
a punch in the eye?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.501
He did that to you-- why?

25:12.503 --> 25:13.970
We were just horsing around.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.771
Really? You know what I think?

25:15.773 --> 25:17.857
I think you did something
to drive him to his death.

25:17.859 --> 25:18.724
No...

25:18.726 --> 25:19.725
Where you going?

25:19.727 --> 25:21.060
You said I wasn't
under arrest.

25:21.062 --> 25:22.511
That means I'm free
to go, right?

25:22.513 --> 25:24.397
Yeah, technically.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.782
Well, I'm sorry.

25:26.784 --> 25:30.153
What are you sorry about, Tyler?

25:30.155 --> 25:32.538
'Cause I'd really like to know.

25:34.524 --> 25:36.409
Gavin's dead.

25:36.411 --> 25:39.028
Just... let him rest in peace.

25:52.915 --> 25:55.917
What did he mean
"Just let him rest in peace"?

25:55.919 --> 25:58.870
This guy Tyler is
our only lead.

25:58.872 --> 25:59.954
How come you let him go?

25:59.956 --> 26:01.306
I had to let him go.

26:01.308 --> 26:03.124
Guy didn't commit a crime--
what do you want me to do?

26:03.126 --> 26:05.677
12th Precinct, Officer Reagan--
how can I help you?

26:05.679 --> 26:07.345
I'll connect you.

26:07.347 --> 26:10.215
The guy fled when you
identified yourself.

26:10.217 --> 26:11.549
No way he's right.

26:11.551 --> 26:15.220
Jamie, I wasn't there
in an official capacity, okay?

26:15.222 --> 26:18.106
So even if I wanted to arrest
the guy, I couldn't.

26:18.108 --> 26:20.108
Besides, the idea is
to get the guy to talk

26:20.110 --> 26:22.009
before he lawyers up.

26:22.979 --> 26:25.179
I need to talk to this guy.

26:25.181 --> 26:27.348
Absolutely not--
you're not talking to him.

26:28.784 --> 26:31.870
12th Precinct, Officer Reagan--
how can I help you?

26:33.522 --> 26:35.957
Yeah, I'll send
a unit right over

26:35.959 --> 26:38.626
to arrest you
for making nuisance calls.

26:41.997 --> 26:45.583
Lady calls to report a ten-year-
old for not making her bed.

26:45.585 --> 26:48.202
What am I supposed to do--
go shoot her?

26:48.204 --> 26:51.056
You know, PR may not be
his true calling, Sarge.

26:51.058 --> 26:54.476
You don't have anywhere
better to be, Danny, huh?

26:54.478 --> 26:55.643
Actually I was
just leaving, Sarge.

26:55.645 --> 26:57.595
If I hang around here
with you too long,

26:57.597 --> 26:58.897
I might get a paper cut.

26:58.899 --> 27:01.066
I'll talk to you later.

27:02.268 --> 27:04.552
Listen...

27:04.554 --> 27:07.105
after a fatal shooting,
it's mandatory

27:07.107 --> 27:08.990
to see a department shrink.

27:10.076 --> 27:12.327
You need to do that.

27:12.329 --> 27:13.528
Now.

27:15.898 --> 27:18.533
Okay?

27:24.757 --> 27:27.625
What was the intended purpose
of the funds in question?

27:27.627 --> 27:29.511
The fund was earmarked
for a program

27:29.513 --> 27:31.012
to safeguard
against voter fraud.

27:31.014 --> 27:32.914
Is that an actual problem?

27:32.916 --> 27:34.716
Well, my first election,
a targeted a group

27:34.718 --> 27:37.168
of economically
downtrodden constituents

27:37.170 --> 27:39.420
were wrongly turned away
from the polls.

27:39.422 --> 27:40.688
Objection.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.924
On what grounds, Mr. Skolnick?

27:42.926 --> 27:43.925
Relevance?

27:43.927 --> 27:45.527
Overruled.

27:46.312 --> 27:47.762
The fund was to prevent that

27:47.764 --> 27:49.030
from ever happening again.

27:49.032 --> 27:51.566
And who was in charge
of this program?

27:51.568 --> 27:53.485
The defendant, Ryan McLaughlin.

27:54.436 --> 27:56.488
No further questions.

27:56.490 --> 27:58.773
Does the defense wish to
cross-examine the witness?

27:58.775 --> 28:00.875
Extensively,
Your Honor.

28:00.877 --> 28:03.161
I remind you, you're
under oath, Mr. Mayor.

28:03.163 --> 28:05.213
Weren't these funds
just a payoff

28:05.215 --> 28:06.781
for implementing...
Objection.

28:06.783 --> 28:07.749
Mr. Skolnick!

28:07.751 --> 28:09.283
... only after...
Argumentative.

28:09.285 --> 28:10.168
Counselor!

28:10.170 --> 28:11.219
You threw my client
under the bus.

28:11.221 --> 28:12.954
Badgering the witness.

28:12.956 --> 28:15.289
Mr. Skolnick, sit down!

28:18.477 --> 28:19.278
Sustained.

28:19.279 --> 28:21.449
The witness is not on trial,
Defense clearly doesn't

28:21.450 --> 28:22.286
have a leg to stand on.

28:22.311 --> 28:24.370
Ms. Reagan, I already
sustained your objections.

28:26.902 --> 28:28.353
It's Friday
afternoon.

28:28.355 --> 28:30.371
I think we should
let the jury go.

28:30.373 --> 28:32.373
You are not to
discuss this case.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.141
Mr. Mayor?

28:34.143 --> 28:35.476
I expect that we will see you

28:35.478 --> 28:38.279
for finish cross-examination
Monday morning?

28:38.281 --> 28:40.314
9:30 sharp.

28:41.817 --> 28:43.251
Court is adjourned.

28:44.988 --> 28:47.255
I appreciate you shutting
him down so quickly.

28:47.257 --> 28:49.323
He's gonna have another
crack at me on Monday.

28:49.325 --> 28:51.075
Not on that line
of questioning, he isn't.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.159
Erin?

28:52.161 --> 28:53.628
Speak of the devil.

28:53.630 --> 28:56.297
I thought you were above
withholding evidence.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.799
I'm gonna spend
the weekend drafting

28:57.801 --> 28:59.634
a motion against you
for sanctions.

28:59.636 --> 29:00.852
Sanctions for what?

29:00.854 --> 29:02.854
And you should be brought up
on sanctions for discussing

29:02.856 --> 29:05.390
this case in front of a witness
that's still on the stand.

29:06.775 --> 29:10.478
You shouldn't withhold
exculpatory evidence, Erin.

29:14.483 --> 29:15.850
Do you know what
he's talking about?

29:15.852 --> 29:16.868
I have no idea.

29:16.870 --> 29:19.404
You don't file sanctions
against an ADA

29:19.406 --> 29:20.655
with nothing to back it up.

29:20.657 --> 29:21.739
Erin, he's bluffing.

29:21.741 --> 29:24.125
Okay, but if he has
found evidence

29:24.127 --> 29:26.711
that's even remotely
exculpatory, and he convinces

29:26.713 --> 29:29.414
the judge that I knew about it,
I could be disbarred.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.050
Erin, I promise you,

29:32.052 --> 29:34.335
you have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

29:42.144 --> 29:45.597
I thought I'd have
to lie down on a couch.

29:45.599 --> 29:48.049
Oh, we can't afford those
on a government budget.

29:48.934 --> 29:51.319
You can take a seat,
though, if you like.

29:52.187 --> 29:53.938
Great, I get to tell
my shooting story

29:53.940 --> 29:55.490
for the hundredth time.

29:55.492 --> 29:58.326
No, you don't have to do that.

29:58.328 --> 29:59.744
This is a trauma debriefing.

29:59.746 --> 30:01.996
It's not
a psych evaluation.

30:01.998 --> 30:05.166
Everything you say here is
confidential and off the record.

30:05.168 --> 30:06.734
I'm not taking notes,
I'm not reporting

30:06.736 --> 30:07.919
back to the department.

30:07.921 --> 30:10.955
Right, so why is
it mandatory then?

30:10.957 --> 30:13.908
It's a preventative service.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.910
Preventing what?

30:15.912 --> 30:17.929
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

30:17.931 --> 30:20.048
Yeah, I don't have that.

30:20.050 --> 30:22.433
Most people experience
low to moderate symptoms

30:22.435 --> 30:24.886
after an incident like this.

30:24.888 --> 30:28.139
They usually resolve themselves
in a couple of weeks.

30:28.141 --> 30:32.226
This is just to let you know
what to look out for.

30:32.228 --> 30:36.230
Door slams, you jump out of
your skin-- I don't have PTSD.

30:36.232 --> 30:39.067
Also, irritability.

30:41.104 --> 30:44.622
Yeah, okay, I have
a little bit of that.

30:44.624 --> 30:47.608
Headaches, rapid heart rate.

30:47.610 --> 30:51.079
Intrusive thoughts.

30:51.081 --> 30:53.614
Reliving the experience over
and over in your head,

30:53.616 --> 30:56.334
trying to change the outcome.

30:56.336 --> 31:00.305
The last one, I do that.

31:15.137 --> 31:16.988
You gonna let that
pork chop go to waste?

31:16.990 --> 31:19.407
'Cause if you are, you know,
I'll take it off your hands.

31:20.976 --> 31:22.744
Thank you.
Uncle Jamie,

31:22.746 --> 31:25.663
Richie Sullivan wanted me to
thank you for saving his life.

31:25.665 --> 31:27.115
Who's Richie Sullivan?

31:27.117 --> 31:29.334
A guy in
our Tae Kwon Do class.

31:30.252 --> 31:32.253
He was on
our school field trip

31:32.255 --> 31:34.172
and a man pointed
a gun right at him.

31:34.174 --> 31:36.157
You saved them.

31:36.159 --> 31:38.259
Richie was never
in any real danger, bud.

31:38.261 --> 31:41.295
Tell Richie Sullivan
your uncle said he's welcome.

31:41.297 --> 31:44.599
Tae Kwon Do, huh?

31:44.601 --> 31:46.934
How'd you let them talk you
into that one, Aunt Linda?

31:46.936 --> 31:49.604
Well, they sold me
on the focus and discipline,

31:49.606 --> 31:52.690
but all I've seen so far
is a lot of kicking.

31:52.692 --> 31:55.176
And punching

31:55.178 --> 31:56.694
and striking.

31:56.696 --> 31:59.530
He scratches the back
of his head

31:59.532 --> 32:02.116
when he's bluffing.

32:02.118 --> 32:04.068
Who?

32:04.070 --> 32:05.486
The mayor-- he has a tell.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.039
He scratches the back of his
head when he's bluffing.

32:08.041 --> 32:10.208
Picked it up in a poker game--
cleaned him out.

32:11.244 --> 32:13.411
That's good to know.
Mm-hmm.

32:13.413 --> 32:16.214
He's a politician, he must
do a lot of scratching.

32:18.218 --> 32:20.635
Is it true you drew
Amazing Grace, kid?

32:20.637 --> 32:22.253
Who's Amazing Grace?

32:22.255 --> 32:24.255
The department shrink.

32:24.257 --> 32:25.873
Does that mean
he's crazy?

32:25.875 --> 32:27.975
No, Wisenheimer, it
doesn't mean he's crazy.

32:27.977 --> 32:30.178
It's department policy-- after
a shooting, you have to go.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.562
You got no choice.

32:31.564 --> 32:33.981
Well, not that seeing
a shrink means you're crazy.

32:33.983 --> 32:36.350
My day, there was
no department shrink.

32:36.352 --> 32:39.187
Yeah, guys bottled it up
until they stroked out.

32:39.189 --> 32:42.573
Ah, the good old days.

32:47.579 --> 32:49.330
<i>I told you, you should've</i>
<i>arrested Tyler.</i>

32:49.332 --> 32:50.665
<i>Yeah, well, and you need</i>

32:50.667 --> 32:52.290
<i>to learn to let things go</i>
<i>before you stroke out.</i>

32:52.291 --> 32:53.740
Do we know what
Tyler's doing here?

32:53.742 --> 32:55.909
Trespassing, for starters.

32:55.911 --> 32:56.910
Hey!

32:56.912 --> 32:58.162
Whoa, whoa, whoa--
you hang back

32:58.164 --> 32:59.496
till I find out
what's going on with Tyler.

32:59.498 --> 33:00.798
What-- you expect me
to wait in the car?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.082
I'll crack the window for you.

33:02.084 --> 33:03.217
Look, kid, you shouldn't
even be here.

33:03.219 --> 33:04.451
I'm the one who needs answers.

33:04.453 --> 33:06.119
And I'm gonna get them
for you, trust me.

33:06.121 --> 33:07.287
I'm coming in.

33:08.557 --> 33:10.140
Suit yourself.

33:10.975 --> 33:12.392
Hey.

33:12.394 --> 33:14.728
Hey. A few of us came
in to tear down the Job Fair.

33:14.730 --> 33:16.730
Tyler showed up, acting...
pretty bizarre.

33:16.732 --> 33:18.348
Yeah? He got any
weapons on him?

33:18.350 --> 33:20.517
Not that I know of,
but he's definitely high.

33:20.519 --> 33:21.801
Look, he-he's a good guy.

33:21.803 --> 33:23.153
Whatever went down
with you the other day

33:23.155 --> 33:24.271
must've set him off.
All right.

33:24.273 --> 33:25.239
We'll take care of it, okay?

33:25.241 --> 33:26.973
We need you to
stay out here.

33:31.863 --> 33:33.080
Tyler?

33:34.532 --> 33:35.749
Sorry.

33:35.751 --> 33:37.117
We ain't gonna
hurt you.

33:37.119 --> 33:38.785
We just came to
talk, all right?

33:41.039 --> 33:43.207
What are you on, Tyler?

33:43.209 --> 33:44.824
Everything.

33:44.826 --> 33:47.761
I just, I just want it to stop.
I-I want him to stop.

33:47.763 --> 33:49.713
I want him to stop,
but he won't, he won't stop!

33:49.715 --> 33:51.682
Who? Who, Tyler?
Gavin? He's dead.

33:54.519 --> 33:55.936
Tell us why.

33:55.938 --> 33:58.472
A mistake.

33:58.474 --> 33:59.857
It was a mistake.

33:59.859 --> 34:01.308
Why don't you just hang back,
kid, all right?

34:01.310 --> 34:02.476
Don't get yourself
in trouble.

34:02.478 --> 34:03.677
I'm not leaving, Danny.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.030
Why did he want to kill himself?

34:08.683 --> 34:09.683
Who are you?

34:09.685 --> 34:11.518
I'm Officer Jamie Reagan.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.704
You're the one
who killed Gavin.

34:14.572 --> 34:17.324
No... no, Gavin brought
this on himself.

34:18.293 --> 34:20.077
Why don't you tell us
why he did it, okay?

34:20.911 --> 34:22.880
I just wanted him to pay
for what he did.

34:22.882 --> 34:24.364
He wasn't supposed to die.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.632
What did he do?

34:28.034 --> 34:29.369
What did he do, Tyler?

34:32.223 --> 34:32.871
Uh-uh.

34:32.873 --> 34:33.974
Hey.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.677
Take it easy.

34:39.847 --> 34:41.063
Get your hand
out of your pocket.

34:41.065 --> 34:42.349
Hey, get your hand out
of your pocket.

34:42.351 --> 34:44.735
Hey! Drop it!
Hey! Drop the knife!

34:50.391 --> 34:51.992
Call an ambulance!

34:51.994 --> 34:54.494
No, don't you die on me!

35:04.995 --> 35:06.562
Before I have them
bring the jury in,

35:06.564 --> 35:07.763
are there any applications?

35:07.765 --> 35:09.882
Is the judge's offer

35:09.884 --> 35:11.384
for the top count plea
still open?

35:11.386 --> 35:13.085
What?

35:13.087 --> 35:15.087
If the defendant would plead out

35:15.089 --> 35:17.423
at the top count
of the indictment,

35:17.425 --> 35:19.058
this being his first offense,

35:19.060 --> 35:20.476
I would still be inclined

35:20.478 --> 35:22.094
to recommend a sentence
of one to three.

35:22.096 --> 35:23.312
Then, at this time,

35:23.314 --> 35:24.564
the defendant would like
to plead guilty

35:24.566 --> 35:26.399
to grand larceny
in the third degree.

35:26.401 --> 35:27.600
Why?

35:28.435 --> 35:30.069
Is there a problem, Ms. Reagan?

35:32.156 --> 35:34.857
No, I'm just... surprised.

35:34.859 --> 35:37.743
I have the mayor
outside waiting to be crossed.

35:37.745 --> 35:40.413
Well, much as we hate
to inconvenience

35:40.415 --> 35:41.664
His Majesty the Mayor,

35:41.666 --> 35:43.866
the defendant is pleading guilty

35:43.868 --> 35:45.334
to charges you brought
against him.

35:45.336 --> 35:47.286
It's a conviction, Ms. Reagan.

35:47.288 --> 35:49.238
Take it.

35:50.740 --> 35:51.924
The defendant will now stand

35:51.926 --> 35:55.044
and allocute to the pending
charges against him.

35:56.346 --> 35:58.381
So the two of you
just happened to end up

35:58.383 --> 36:00.049
with a guy
you felt was connected

36:00.051 --> 36:01.851
to the case.

36:01.853 --> 36:03.436
What are the odds?

36:03.438 --> 36:06.856
Danny, you always seem
to land on your feet.

36:06.858 --> 36:08.757
But someday you won't,

36:08.759 --> 36:10.309
and I won't be
able to help.

36:10.311 --> 36:12.028
At least, I shouldn't.

36:12.030 --> 36:13.279
I understand.

36:13.281 --> 36:16.699
I would see this thing through
for a partner,

36:16.701 --> 36:19.535
I damn well gotta see it through
for my kid brother.

36:19.537 --> 36:22.438
And as your boss, I'm ordering
you to listen to your father.

36:23.874 --> 36:24.874
Yes, sir.

36:24.876 --> 36:27.293
No more going
off the grid.

36:27.295 --> 36:28.544
Though, now that I did,

36:28.546 --> 36:31.297
I stumbled upon the guy who is
legitimately my case.

36:31.299 --> 36:34.333
And what case is
that, exactly?

36:34.335 --> 36:36.719
Tyler is the key to finding out
what happened to Gavin.

36:36.721 --> 36:39.171
Jamie deserves to hear what
this guy's got to say.

36:39.173 --> 36:41.090
What's Tyler's condition?

36:41.092 --> 36:44.010
He's stable, but he's sedated,
so I can't talk to him.

36:44.012 --> 36:46.062
So what are you thinking?

36:46.064 --> 36:48.097
I'm thinking that something
pretty heavy went down

36:48.099 --> 36:50.099
with Tyler and Gavin
when they were back in college.

36:50.101 --> 36:52.068
So I put in a call
to Cambridge PD

36:52.070 --> 36:54.320
to look into some cold cases
from back then.

36:56.157 --> 36:57.607
I suppose...

36:57.609 --> 36:59.859
we could get Tyler on menacing

36:59.861 --> 37:02.078
and criminal possession
of a weapon.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.581
There's not a lot
of leverage in that.

37:05.583 --> 37:06.832
Well, with the right judge,

37:06.834 --> 37:08.200
maybe you can get
a search warrant.

37:08.202 --> 37:12.154
If the right person calls
the right judge.

37:14.708 --> 37:17.760
Not a word of this
to the commissioner.

37:21.515 --> 37:23.516
Erin!

37:23.518 --> 37:25.718
You're still here.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.887
Why wouldn't I be?

37:27.889 --> 37:28.888
What happened?

37:28.890 --> 37:30.056
Don't tell me the
trial was continued.

37:30.058 --> 37:31.557
No, the trial's over.

37:31.559 --> 37:32.441
Ryan pled out.

37:32.443 --> 37:34.110
So we won.

37:34.112 --> 37:36.612
Yeah, that's a
win-win for you.

37:39.449 --> 37:40.650
Give me a second.

37:40.652 --> 37:41.784
Erin, I'm not quite sure

37:41.786 --> 37:43.069
what that's supposed to mean.

37:43.071 --> 37:44.853
I don't know
why Skolnick

37:44.855 --> 37:46.789
would make the claims
that he did on Friday

37:46.791 --> 37:48.824
and then turn around and
fall on his sword today.

37:48.826 --> 37:50.859
Well, I told you: because there was no
exculpatory evidence.

37:50.861 --> 37:52.078
He was bluffing.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.030
I think there was a backroom
deal made over the weekend

37:55.032 --> 37:56.549
that I'm not privy to.

37:56.551 --> 38:00.035
Erin, none that I had
any knowledge of.

38:00.037 --> 38:02.555
You promised me that I had
nothing to worry about,

38:02.557 --> 38:04.924
and all the sanction threats
that he made

38:04.926 --> 38:07.143
just magically disappeared.

38:07.145 --> 38:08.511
Okay.

38:08.513 --> 38:09.512
Go ahead and ask me.

38:09.514 --> 38:10.846
Ask you what?

38:10.848 --> 38:12.098
If there is anything to

38:12.100 --> 38:13.599
the mud they were
flinging at me.

38:16.236 --> 38:19.572
I am an officer of this court.

38:19.574 --> 38:21.574
If there were any lies told
under oath,

38:21.576 --> 38:23.326
I am obligated to report them.

38:23.328 --> 38:24.660
Ask.

38:27.497 --> 38:29.064
Were there?

38:30.617 --> 38:32.001
No.

38:36.340 --> 38:39.458
Good.

38:59.863 --> 39:01.647
You look like
you're having fun.

39:01.649 --> 39:03.032
No, but tell me
I'm about to.

39:03.034 --> 39:04.700
You executed
Tyler's search warrant?

39:04.702 --> 39:06.485
I did.

39:08.438 --> 39:10.623
What's with you and
the dramatic pauses?

39:10.625 --> 39:12.375
Your guy Tyler
was the recipient

39:12.377 --> 39:13.826
of Gavin Bryant's
suicide note.

39:15.379 --> 39:17.380
Gavin left a suicide note?

39:17.382 --> 39:19.114
Well, that's beautiful.
What'd it say?

39:19.116 --> 39:20.616
In your cold
case files here,

39:20.618 --> 39:22.951
you find anything involving
someone named Anna?

39:22.953 --> 39:24.587
Anna. Uh...

39:24.589 --> 39:27.256
Maybe one in rape
and one in homicide.

39:27.258 --> 39:28.507
Why? What does the note say?

39:28.509 --> 39:30.393
Read it for yourself.

39:33.230 --> 39:36.148
"Tyler, you were right.

39:36.150 --> 39:38.100
"I have to pay for what I did,
but I can't face

39:38.102 --> 39:39.235
the punishment
you have chosen for me."

39:39.237 --> 39:42.071
What punishment did
you choose for him?

39:42.073 --> 39:43.355
Prison.

39:43.357 --> 39:46.225
Told him if he didn't turn
himself in, I would.

39:48.412 --> 39:51.280
"Anna was just a few years older
than my own daughter is now.

39:51.282 --> 39:52.748
"I took her life...

39:52.750 --> 39:54.667
I choose to take my own
in return."

39:56.069 --> 39:58.037
Anna Purcell.

39:58.039 --> 39:59.321
Young girl killed
in a hit-and-run

39:59.323 --> 40:01.507
15 years ago.

40:02.459 --> 40:03.926
This was you and Gavin?

40:05.212 --> 40:07.430
We were both high.

40:08.348 --> 40:11.767
Gavin insisted on driving.

40:14.688 --> 40:16.222
He hit her.

40:16.224 --> 40:18.724
Dragged her two blocks,
didn't even stop.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.361
Why didn't you turn him in then?

40:24.781 --> 40:26.198
He was my friend.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.567
He told me he'd rather die
than go to prison.

40:28.569 --> 40:30.486
So instead, you did nothing.

40:30.488 --> 40:32.371
And look how it turned
out for you.

40:32.373 --> 40:34.123
It ruined my life.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.691
It ruined a lot of lives.

40:35.693 --> 40:37.910
Gavin's turned out perfectly.

40:37.912 --> 40:39.495
It wasn't fair.

40:39.497 --> 40:41.363
"I have a gun.

40:41.365 --> 40:43.666
"I'll go somewhere my family
won't find my body.

40:43.668 --> 40:46.085
"I pray I have the nerve to
carry it out.

40:46.087 --> 40:48.554
"If I turn out to be a coward
in this as well,

40:48.556 --> 40:50.339
I promise I'll find
an alternative."

40:50.341 --> 40:53.676
Well, Gavin found his
alternative, all right.

40:54.511 --> 40:56.812
Yeah, his alternative was me.

41:08.725 --> 41:10.910
So we read him
the suicide note

41:10.912 --> 41:12.361
and he opened
up about it.

41:12.363 --> 41:13.362
Yep.

41:13.364 --> 41:15.030
Though Jamie did a hell of a job

41:15.032 --> 41:16.832
putting the pieces together
all by himself.

41:18.668 --> 41:20.369
Ten percent.

41:20.371 --> 41:21.954
What's 10%?

41:21.956 --> 41:25.174
Jamie wanted to know how many
cops who fired their weapon

41:25.176 --> 41:27.710
in the line of duty
had a fatal result.

41:27.712 --> 41:28.744
Oh...

41:28.746 --> 41:29.912
Ten percent.

41:29.914 --> 41:32.748
10% of the 5%.
Yep.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.934
And three of them are
sitting right here.

41:34.936 --> 41:37.085
What are the
odds of that?

41:38.254 --> 41:40.940
It's not a club
anyone asks to join.

41:40.942 --> 41:43.225
Nope, but here we are.

41:43.227 --> 41:44.777
What does that say about us?

41:46.280 --> 41:49.565
Maybe when basic instinct says
to run away from a fire,

41:49.567 --> 41:51.099
a few run towards it.

41:54.037 --> 41:55.538
"If he fails,

41:55.540 --> 41:57.606
"he at least fails
daring greatly,

41:57.608 --> 41:58.807
so that his place..""

41:58.809 --> 42:01.377
"...shall not be with
those cold and timid souls

42:01.379 --> 42:03.779
who neither know
victory or defeat."

42:06.867 --> 42:08.634
Here's to never again.

42:08.636 --> 42:09.718
Hear, hear.
