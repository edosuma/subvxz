WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:02.961
<i>My mom once told me that</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:06.047
<i>the only thing more dangerous
than the dead is the living.</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:07.465
Come on! I ain't got all day!

00:07.841 --> 00:10.301
<i>But without the living,
we might as well be dead.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:13.096
<i>No!</i>

00:14.180 --> 00:16.016
<i>We all need people we can count on.</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:20.311
<i>And that's not just about words...</i>

00:21.688 --> 00:22.731
<i>but action.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.279
<i>Having the strength to put someone
else's life ahead of your own.</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:32.699
<i>If we're willing to do that,</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:36.661
<i>then maybe we can get back
some piece of what we've lost.</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:51.968
Thought I recognized your footsteps.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.972
You know me a little too well.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.308
Didn't we already say goodbye?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.434
Did we?

00:59.976 --> 01:02.395
Well, I guess this is just
a friendly visit on your way out.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.939
Thought you could use some extra
medical supplies to take back.

01:05.356 --> 01:06.566
Yeah. Thank you.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.485
I was just getting some more food

01:08.985 --> 01:10.487
to take to meet up with the others.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.739
I left you some sesame bagels
in the back,

01:12.739 --> 01:14.324
if you think you might like those.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.535
Hmm?

01:21.414 --> 01:22.457
Zeke?

05:13.813 --> 05:16.107
- They took the kids.
- They took everyone.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.567
Come on.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.278
These people are
enemies of the state.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.989
But I can assure you
the situation is well in hand.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.576
I've already suspended
all migrant entry into the city

05:26.576 --> 05:27.827
until further notice.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.997
I'm glad our contributions to
the Commonwealth's future

05:30.997 --> 05:32.332
have not been in vain.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.379
And, um, if I may,
on a personal note,

05:39.339 --> 05:42.467
I'm truly sorry about Sebastian.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.719
Kayla is distraught.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.847
To lose a child is unthinkable.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.809
Worse than death, yes.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.271
But Sebastian will always
be with me.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.647
Get your hands off me!

05:57.607 --> 05:58.900
Where are they?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.528
Yumiko.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.781
It's fine. It's fine.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.949
There's no threat.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.826
Right now, I'm the biggest
threat you have.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.162
I suggest
you say goodbye to your guests

06:11.162 --> 06:12.789
and tell me
what the hell's going on.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.792
I'm not leaving until you do.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.252
We were just wrapping up.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.006
Thank you all for coming by
and sharing your thoughts.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.563
I've been expecting you.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.689
Where are they?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.608
Your friends have been removed
from the Commonwealth.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.819
"Removed"? What, like the
hundreds of other people

06:42.819 --> 06:44.028
you've had disappeared?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.279
Call it what you want.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.990
But their rebellion and defiance
of our laws left me no choice.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.327
Please. As if you have
any respect for the law.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.955
I do. That's why I hired you.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.791
I want nothing more than
to see justice prevail,

06:56.791 --> 06:59.085
to see order restored from chaos.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.629
And how does abducting my people
accomplish that?

07:02.505 --> 07:05.383
I want to assure my citizens
that the trial of the man

07:05.383 --> 07:08.386
who killed Sebastian
will remain impartial.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.680
That justice will be served,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.182
no matter which side
someone falls on.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.769
Who better to bring
that impartial justice,

07:17.228 --> 07:18.771
than Eugene Porter's friend?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.778
You want me to prosecute Eugene?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.281
On behalf of the Commonwealth, yes.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.453
Sign my friend's death warrant in
some kangaroo court publicity stunt?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.704
Yeah, that's never going to happen.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.039
Well, then neither will
the reunion with your friends.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.374
Is that what you want?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.127
And let's not forget your brother.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.883
You should consider how your actions
might affect him as well.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.013
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
prepare for a press conference

07:52.013 --> 07:55.057
announcing your intent
to prosecute Mr. Porter.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.726
Don't be late.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.863
I don't know. They jumped me.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.156
They even took Dog.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.700
You think they were troopers?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.577
I think they were
working for Pamela.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.662
We got to find Mercer.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.541
Well, you don't think
he would turn us in?

08:23.711 --> 08:25.421
Shit. There is one other person.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.089
Hornsby?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.967
He knows all the dark shit
that goes on here.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.260
You know where to find him?

08:32.803 --> 08:34.805
Yeah, but this isn't gonna be easy.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.893
When is it ever?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.107
(OVER PA) <i>Mr. Barker,
please return to admitting.</i>

08:48.528 --> 08:51.280
Be sure to keep the area clean

08:51.364 --> 08:53.324
and change the dressing once a day.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.713
Miko, you okay?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.590
- What is it?
- My friends have been taken.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.884
- Removed from the Commonwealth.
- What?

09:11.968 --> 09:13.970
- Magna, Connie, Kelly.
- Ezekiel?

09:13.970 --> 09:16.597
All of them! On Pamela's orders.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.599
And now she's demanding that

09:18.683 --> 09:20.726
I prosecute Eugene
if I want to see them again.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.777
I imagine she threatened me, too.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.574
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.367
You think that's what
I'm worried about?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.620
She expects you to fold.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.330
She stacked the deck that way.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.666
And if you don't,
what happens to you?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.792
I don't know.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.168
I don't know!

09:47.795 --> 09:49.755
There has to be another way, okay?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.799
Just tell me what to do.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.384
I'm trying. I'm trying.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.510
Listen to me.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.597
I know it's not what
you want to hear,

09:57.597 --> 10:01.017
but maybe the best way to
protect your friends and yourself

10:01.517 --> 10:03.477
is to give Pamela what she wants.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.438
That means sacrificing Eugene.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.814
What choice do you have?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.445
Sunlight is supposed to be
the best disinfectant, right?

10:13.237 --> 10:15.114
But Pamela is still standing.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.824
What does that tell you?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.704
There isn't some kind of justice
waiting around the corner.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.001
You can just accept that?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.377
It's not acceptance.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.254
It's survival.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.925
That's what you want
for your friends.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.763
That's what they would want for you.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.572
Okay. I'll keep you posted.
I'll be right back.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.608
Hey.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.087
Fucking hell.

14:00.214 --> 14:04.468
Always a path.
Always a path. Always a path.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.605
There's always a path.

14:17.648 --> 14:23.237
Always a path. Always a way out.
Always a path.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.825
Always a path. Always a path.

14:42.506 --> 14:47.219
Always a path. Always a path.
Always a path.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.312
Always a way out.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.655
Where'd they take 'em? Where?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.420
Enough.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.928
Lance. Lance.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.057
Lance, look at me.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.518
Look at me.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.155
We can't leave you here alive.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.158
Either you tell us
where our friends are,

15:52.660 --> 15:53.869
or you're dead.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.346
I'll show you.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.893
You don't trust me. I get it.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.188
But I know a way out of the city.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.320
- Move.
- Wait.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.365
What is that?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.911
It's a radio-frequency monitor.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
It'll set an alarm off
if I leave this place.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.667
You're gonna have to
cut off my foot.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.087
Are you gonna carry me?

16:46.880 --> 16:49.508
You better be ready to run fast. Go.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.010
Wait.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.388
I need to do something first.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.189
Right here.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.244
Keep going!

17:19.288 --> 17:20.748
- Come on!
- Go!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.082
Go! Get him out of here.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.834
- Not without you!
- I'll figure it out! Go!

17:23.834 --> 17:25.377
Cover me!

17:30.591 --> 17:31.967
Go, go, go!

18:24.603 --> 18:25.687
Excuse me.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.994
The optics for tonight's
press conference

18:41.078 --> 18:43.413
are critical to regaining
the public's trust.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.125
The takeaway needs to be that

18:46.125 --> 18:49.086
we're moving forward
in a transparent, open way.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.171
Also, Max...

18:53.006 --> 18:54.133
Sorry, Kathleen.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.343
That's all right, ma'am.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.513
The Commonwealth Army
should be there,

18:59.513 --> 19:00.806
but only in the background.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.184
I want to present a peaceful return
to law and order.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.186
It can't feel like a police state.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.398
That will only stir up
any lingering resentments.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.451
Yes?

20:34.942 --> 20:37.319
How much farther?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.321
Just a couple miles up.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.910
Just never realized until now

20:44.910 --> 20:46.703
how much it looks like a prison
from out here.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.332
You were right to leave him behind.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.334
He was slowing you down.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.169
Just like everyone does.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.505
What's that supposed to mean?

20:57.464 --> 20:59.007
You're not like most people.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.301
You're always thinking
ten steps ahead.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.511
It's what makes you special.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.806
I mean, who else could have done
what you just did?

21:07.849 --> 21:08.892
Anyway...

21:10.227 --> 21:11.353
I hope Dixon's okay.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.483
Hey! Whoa.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.777
I know what you're trying to do.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.696
I'm just making conversation.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.657
- Where are we going?
- I told you I'd take you there.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.035
I'm done with your mind games.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.121
I'm not lying to you!

21:29.121 --> 21:31.498
Saying you give a shit about
what happens to Daryl.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.253
I was just locked in a cell
and forced to feed my colleague

21:36.253 --> 21:37.754
piece by piece to
Pamela's rotter son.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.548
I might not be moving
at full speed here.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.093
Fine.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.219
Do it.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.388
And then good luck
finding your friends.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.508
- Check the tree line!
- Do it!

22:26.762 --> 22:29.639
- I know how we can lose them.
- How?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.099
Come on.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.479
Come on.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.322
I can't believe they're gone.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.994
Connie put her trust in me,
and I let her down.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.165
It was the only lead we had.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.925
I don't think I have a choice
but to do what Pamela's asking me.

23:14.101 --> 23:17.521
If that means you have to prosecute
me to the fullest extent of the law,

23:17.521 --> 23:20.315
then rest assured, it's a fate
I've already freely accepted.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.442
- Eugene, I don't want to do this.
- It's okay.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.568
It's okay.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.863
I've made my choices and my bed.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.740
Now I must lie in it.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.286
But even if that should
come to pass,

23:34.162 --> 23:37.874
the central dilemma of our
kidnapped compadres remains.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.920
What if the worst happens
while this trial plays out?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.006
What if the Governor reneges on
her promise to set them free?

23:46.633 --> 23:48.135
We must do something.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.012
What? What?

23:53.014 --> 23:54.933
Pamela has all the leverage here.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.105
I'll admit, it does appear that way.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.777
But I have to believe
there's still something we can do.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.865
Because if not, if our friends
are truly gone, then...

24:15.745 --> 24:18.290
Then that is a beast of burden
I simply cannot live with,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.500
even for the truncated time
I likely have left.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.129
This isn't your fault, Eugene.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.548
No.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.010
And you being made by Connie's
would be-abductor isn't yours.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.765
One thing we can do

24:37.017 --> 24:38.477
is return the unwavering faith

24:38.477 --> 24:40.770
our absconded friends
have always shown for us

24:40.854 --> 24:43.899
and trust that no matter bleak
things look in this moment

24:43.899 --> 24:46.026
that this is not the end.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.696
Now, that may not mean much

24:50.822 --> 24:52.949
coming from a soon-to-be
convicted felon...

24:57.704 --> 24:58.997
but maybe it's something.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.062
You expect me
to follow you in there?

25:23.146 --> 25:24.731
I do if you don't wanna get caught.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.361
This was an infrastructure
repair project

25:29.361 --> 25:31.655
dating back to the early days
of the Commonwealth.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.744
After a series of cave-ins,
it was considered too unstable.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.715
I meant what I said back there,
about hoping Dixon's all right.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.178
It's hard to find someone like that,
that you'd do anything for.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.598
I felt that way about Pamela once.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.269
Thought I could
make her feel the same about me.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.438
By helping her build the
Commonwealth, run it,

26:07.232 --> 26:08.692
letting her take all the credit.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.487
Even by bringing in
your communities,

26:12.571 --> 26:16.116
which I admit, was mishandled.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.953
But it was never enough.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.039
I know there was nothing I could do

26:23.123 --> 26:24.874
that would ever change
how she saw me.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.752
Just her chauffeur's son.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.090
More importantly, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.218
What comes after?

26:37.012 --> 26:38.054
After what?

26:38.388 --> 26:39.723
The unrest in the Commonwealth.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.101
Let's say Pamela doesn't survive it.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.936
That's gonna open up a power vacuum.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.647
And when that happens,
well, just look at history.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.152
The people who suffer the most
in revolutions are the civilians.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.320
What is your point?

26:54.195 --> 26:58.491
You and your people will hold
50,000 lives in your hands.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.329
Until I find my people,
there is no after.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.332
You'll find them. I know you.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.459
And then you'll have
a choice to make.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.337
Will you let the Commonwealth burn?

27:11.963 --> 27:13.173
That's not my problem.

27:14.674 --> 27:15.800
Sure.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.595
Yeah, you want to leave
all this behind you. I...

27:18.595 --> 27:19.804
I get it.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.183
Me, too.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.480
But what about the kids?

27:32.025 --> 27:34.027
Are you really gonna deny them
their only chance

27:34.027 --> 27:35.862
for the kind of life
we took for granted?

27:37.447 --> 27:41.076
Doesn't the next generation deserve
better than the one before?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.455
Otherwise, what's the point?

27:48.333 --> 27:49.542
Oh, God.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.879
Oh.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.511
Is that skin?

29:33.563 --> 29:36.399
Sorry. The lights went out.
I thought you were right behind me.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.071
Run!

30:01.633 --> 30:02.842
Drop your weapons.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.391
Radio back to Command
that we found them.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.811
But they put up a fight,
so we had to put them down.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.062
Yes, sir.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.183
I'm glad to see
you decided to attend.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.811
I didn't really have a choice.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.772
So how was your stroll
through the square today?

31:00.483 --> 31:01.651
It was lovely.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.405
You should know your friend, Connie,
was picked up earlier.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.824
Not to worry.
She's been placed with the others.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.619
I do admire the loyalty you have
for your people.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.041
I hope someday you'll understand
why I needed to do this for mine.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.752
I already understand.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.171
This is for you.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.882
It's not for them.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.634
Your words tonight will carry
across the Commonwealth

31:26.718 --> 31:29.679
and help restore people's faith
and keep the peace.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.557
They're not my words.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.851
Just bullshit theater.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.687
All the same.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.524
Just make sure you know your lines.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.913
Good evening.

31:55.997 --> 31:59.584
We're here tonight to announce the
Commonwealth will be moving forward

31:59.584 --> 32:01.961
with the prosecution
of Eugene Porter.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.256
Mr. Porter has been
arrested and charged

32:05.340 --> 32:09.135
in connection with the tragic events
that took place on Founders' Day,

32:09.677 --> 32:13.932
including the murder of Governor
Milton's son, Sebastian Milton.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.684
Do you have any updates
on the escapees, Colonel?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.605
I assure you, we have
our best people on this.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.607
Teams are sweeping every quadrant.

32:22.732 --> 32:25.735
At this time, we'd like to introduce
one of the Commonwealth's

32:25.860 --> 32:29.614
most accomplished attorneys,
Ms. Yumiko Okumura.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.369
<i>Alpha Squad was just found dead</i>

32:34.369 --> 32:35.495
<i>in quadrant three.</i>

32:35.495 --> 32:38.206
<i>Dixon, Peletier, Hornsby,
all got away.</i>

32:41.000 --> 32:42.043
Good evening.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.553
I'd like to start by saying

32:53.179 --> 32:55.723
what a privilege it is
to be part of this

32:57.141 --> 32:59.852
great shining city
that we call the Commonwealth.

33:05.483 --> 33:09.237
Not long ago, I was part of a group
whose community had been lost

33:10.071 --> 33:12.115
to the ravages of the outside world.

33:14.617 --> 33:15.868
Left with nothing,

33:16.828 --> 33:19.455
Governor Milton not only welcomed us

33:19.539 --> 33:23.334
but gave us the incredible gift
of a second chance.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.672
A chance to live lives
we thought were gone forever.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.676
For me, that meant
being a lawyer again

33:33.636 --> 33:37.390
and the opportunity to uphold
the sacred ideal of the old world.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.644
Justice.

33:48.317 --> 33:51.487
Eugene Porter was also
a part of my community.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.615
He was...

33:55.908 --> 33:59.037
He was someone
I grew to know well over the years

33:59.037 --> 34:00.705
and even come to trust.

34:03.374 --> 34:07.378
That is why the events of the past
48 hours have shaken me to my core.

34:09.922 --> 34:14.552
They've also renewed my belief that
regardless of the personal cost,

34:16.929 --> 34:18.639
we must always seek justice

34:20.183 --> 34:24.020
if we are to preserve
who we are as a people.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.398
Um...

34:27.940 --> 34:29.484
Sorry.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.822
Before continuing, there's actually
somebody I would like to thank.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.159
Someone who means the world to me

34:38.576 --> 34:41.370
and also to you,
the people of the Commonwealth.

34:41.454 --> 34:46.209
Your thoracic surgeon and
my brother, Tomichi Okumura.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.503
Can you stand up please, Tomi?

34:50.296 --> 34:51.339
Stand up.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.642
Tomi is an invaluable
and irreplaceable

35:02.642 --> 35:04.227
member of this community.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.854
And he's always wanted
what's best for me

35:08.689 --> 35:10.942
and the people of the Commonwealth.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.197
I just wanted to take this moment
to thank him for that.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.710
I'd also like to take
this opportunity

35:29.794 --> 35:32.255
to thank my people
for always having faith in me.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.050
And now I'd like to show
my faith in them,

35:36.467 --> 35:39.262
and also honor
the pursuit of justice,

35:39.512 --> 35:43.057
by announcing my intent
to defend Eugene Porter,

35:43.141 --> 35:45.810
who has been wrongly and
unjustly accused

35:45.810 --> 35:48.062
by Pamela Milton
and the Commonwealth.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.690
We look forward to our day in court,
thank you very much.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.608
I don't know.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.657
Here's your speech.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.744
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.746
We will not be taking
any more questions.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.465
There's two of 'em,
taking shifts walking the perimeter.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.468
Shouldn't be a problem
to take them out.

36:20.636 --> 36:21.804
Not for you, anyway.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.807
Then what?

36:25.433 --> 36:26.726
We head for your friends.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.563
The tracks fork a few times
on the way,

36:30.563 --> 36:33.149
but I know the route
the supply train takes to get there.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.112
Commonwealth has a working train?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.698
It was part of a plan,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.242
a vision,

36:44.243 --> 36:45.912
to expand the Commonwealth's reach.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.374
Connecting communities like yours
all the way to the sea.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.210
Connecting or conquering?

36:56.297 --> 36:57.673
We should move before dawn.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.552
We will. But you won't.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.264
What?

37:05.348 --> 37:06.933
But you can't get there without me.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.434
Yeah, we can.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.812
- How's that?
- You just said it. There's a train.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.274
We wait for it to come,
and then we see where it goes.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.110
But you still need me.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.154
We talked about this.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.156
Not burning the Commonwealth down,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.575
creating a better future
for the children, for everyone.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.203
I know you heard me.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.163
Yeah, only because
you wouldn't shut up.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.169
I helped build the Commonwealth.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.008
Don't you see?
Together, we can make it better.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.594
A place where
everyone can truly have a shot.

37:44.470 --> 37:45.930
I can see the campaign for it.

37:46.305 --> 37:49.267
"Here, you aren't defined
by who you were,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.810
"but what you can become."

37:50.810 --> 37:53.020
It'll signal a new day has come,

37:53.104 --> 37:55.439
a new age where everyone,
all of us, can start again.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.608
Not everyone.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.443
Not you.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.490
So, you're just gonna kill me then?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.954
After everything I've done for you?

38:10.871 --> 38:12.206
You can run.

38:13.666 --> 38:14.959
Run...

38:15.793 --> 38:17.003
Run where?

38:18.170 --> 38:19.338
That's up to you.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.174
But that's all you're gonna get,
a chance.

38:22.717 --> 38:23.843
It's more than you deserve.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.845
All right, look, I've made mistakes.
I know.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.348
But that's not who I am anymore.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.644
That guy is gone.
He died back in that cell.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.816
I won't make it out here.

38:39.942 --> 38:40.985
Good.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.612
You're a smart guy, Lance.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.948
You might survive.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.788
Wait, please just...

38:54.915 --> 38:57.084
- Just hear me out.
- We've heard enough.
