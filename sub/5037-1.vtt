37:09.895 --> 37:12.062
I'll help you make this place
look better on the outside

37:12.064 --> 37:13.564
if you help me show
people that there's more

37:13.590 --> 37:14.931
to me than what they
see on the surface.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.901
And how would I do that?

37:17.903 --> 37:20.804
Train me to compete
in Fire and Ice.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.306
(LAUGHS)
You're joking, right?

37:25.042 --> 37:27.277
Will, it's all about potential.

37:27.279 --> 37:30.313
I mean, I know that I'm not the champion
snowboarder that I thought I was,

37:30.315 --> 37:33.083
but with some coaching
and some really hard work,

37:33.085 --> 37:35.819
I think I can win a medal
that I actually deserve.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.288
And I know this place
may look really shabby now,

37:38.290 --> 37:41.891
but I think I can turn it
into something really special.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.995
We both win.
I'm not a coach.

37:45.086 --> 37:46.619
Oh, come on!

37:47.327 --> 37:49.327
I heard you with your friends.
You know your stuff.

37:50.845 --> 37:53.138
The last time I rode,
I tore a tendon in my knee,

37:53.139 --> 37:56.006
shattered my ankle
and collapsed my lung.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.807
I almost died.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.777
Yeah, but you're
all better <i>now, </i> right?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.612
This conversation's over.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.314
I saw your video.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.217
To be as good as you were,
you have to really love it.

38:07.219 --> 38:10.387
And if you love it that much,
you can't just walk away.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.859
Well, I did.
Come on, boys.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.133
Uhhh!

38:17.839 --> 38:20.297
So because one thing happened
one time, you're gonna

38:20.298 --> 38:22.565
lock yourself up in your house
for the rest of your life?

38:22.567 --> 38:26.102
Honestly, Will,
what are you so afraid of?

38:26.104 --> 38:30.140
I mean, you know that fall you had
was a total freak accident, right?

38:30.142 --> 38:31.908
Oh, so I'm a freak now.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.110
I'm just saying that if you
were to get back out there

38:34.112 --> 38:36.546
the chances of something like that
happening again are super-low.

38:36.548 --> 38:40.116
Look, even if I agree to train
you, you don't have a team.

38:41.585 --> 38:45.121
Well, what about them?

38:45.123 --> 38:47.257
DINK: Check this out!
WILL: Sam and Dink?

38:47.259 --> 38:49.225
Whoo-hoo!

38:49.227 --> 38:51.261
They're your old teammates,
right? It's perfect!

38:51.263 --> 38:54.998
Obviously we'd need to have a serious
discussion about team uniforms,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.933
but I have some ideas.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.936
I can't imagine you being
serious enough to compete.

38:59.938 --> 39:03.373
You spend more time styling outfits
than working on board technique.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.076
That is not fair, because
styling comes naturally to me.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.178
And I can change.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.413
So bring on
the board technique.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.248
I don't know, Kayla.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.017
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

39:14.019 --> 39:16.019
What's up, bra?

39:23.227 --> 39:25.128
BOY: Go, Skye! Whoo!

39:28.165 --> 39:30.133
Whoo!
Yeah, Skye!

39:33.170 --> 39:34.871
Go, Team Swift!

39:34.873 --> 39:37.173
(LAUGHTER)
Yeah!

39:37.175 --> 39:40.076
Looks like they didn't waste
much time replacing me.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.245
That was a killer run, Skye.

39:42.247 --> 39:43.913
You saw that?
Oh, yeah.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.882
Wait a minute. Is that...

39:45.884 --> 39:47.083
Skye Sailor.

39:47.085 --> 39:50.920
But... she's with
pro ice in Aspen.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.455
I've heard she's never lost.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.462
You know, the Swifts didn't
just kick me from their team.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.265
They also beat you, and you
haven't competed since.

40:02.267 --> 40:05.201
They don't think
either of us is a threat.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.305
Wouldn't it be great
to prove them wrong?

40:10.541 --> 40:12.308
What is she talking about?

40:14.078 --> 40:16.179
Kayla's gonna join your team,
and I'm gonna coach you.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.414
Oh! Ha ha!

40:17.416 --> 40:20.183
DINK: Yeah!

40:21.085 --> 40:22.619
Yeah! Uh, wait, wait.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.087
You mean you're
gonna coach <i>her.</i>

40:24.685 --> 40:25.310
Right? Because, I mean,

40:25.353 --> 40:27.023
we all know that
I don't need coaching.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.325
You know? 'Cause
I'm the best <i>ever.</i>

40:30.661 --> 40:34.431
(ALL CHUCKLING)

40:34.433 --> 40:36.599
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

40:36.601 --> 40:39.068
PIA: Let me make sure
I have this right.

40:39.070 --> 40:42.105
You and Will Cloud
are forming your own team

40:42.107 --> 40:43.673
to compete at Fire and Ice.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.509
Me, Will, and these two.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.679
Well, <i>hello, </i> ladies.

40:49.681 --> 40:53.683
Ahem. Low pressure system
movin' in this afternoon.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.452
What are you, a weather man?

40:55.454 --> 40:57.720
I dabble.
But if you're interested,

40:57.722 --> 41:01.157
I could show you some of the
finer points of snow formation.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.359
No, thanks.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.596
Just think about it.

41:06.598 --> 41:09.232
I know. I know.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.266
NICK: Yeah, cool, man.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.534
Catch you later, man.

41:11.536 --> 41:14.304
Be strong.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.008
(GASPS) Oh no, he <i>didn't.</i>

41:19.010 --> 41:22.212
Did he just
silent what-up me?!

41:22.214 --> 41:23.480
(EXCITED CHATTER)

41:25.516 --> 41:28.218
Is <i>that </i> the girl
you were talking about?

41:28.220 --> 41:29.752
Skye Sailor.

41:29.754 --> 41:32.255
She just moved here from Aspen.

41:32.257 --> 41:35.191
Like Fire and Ice wasn't gonna
be hard enough already,

41:35.193 --> 41:38.094
now I have to compete with her.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.429
(BEEP) (BEEP) (BEEP)

41:40.809 --> 41:42.032
You're right, linds.

41:42.033 --> 41:46.269
She obviously doesn't know
that double studs are over.

41:46.271 --> 41:50.607
There is no emoticon to express the
tragedy of her fashion choices.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.475
I pity her.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.150
Good form.

42:03.554 --> 42:05.288
Good amplitude.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.094
Crisp holds.

42:19.103 --> 42:22.338
(CROWD CHEERING)

42:22.340 --> 42:23.773
She's <i>good.</i>

42:26.343 --> 42:27.744
Yeah, I know.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.482
Thank you, everyone,
for the warm welcome.

42:32.484 --> 42:35.084
As exhausting as it is
being a celebrity,

42:35.086 --> 42:37.086
fans like you make it
all worthwhile.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.088
(APPLAUSE) Whoo.

42:44.261 --> 42:45.828
Hi. I'm Skye.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.196
So I've heard.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.831
Oh. Would you like
an autograph?

42:48.833 --> 42:50.400
No. I'm fine, thanks.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.336
Come on, don't be silly.
Anything for my fans.

42:53.338 --> 42:55.405
Who should I make it out to?

42:55.407 --> 42:58.474
Kayla.
As in Kayla Morgan.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.209
Maybe you've heard of me.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.712
Of course I have.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.347
Hmm.

43:04.349 --> 43:06.416
"To Kayla.

43:06.418 --> 43:08.818
Everybody's favorite
daddy's girl."

43:10.454 --> 43:12.388
Actually, why don't you
make it out to

43:12.390 --> 43:15.558
"Kayla, future winner
of Fire and Ice."

43:15.560 --> 43:17.694
(LAUGHS)
And how are you gonna do that

43:17.696 --> 43:20.263
now that the competition
<i>isn't </i> rigged?

43:20.265 --> 43:22.599
I don't know. How are you
gonna deal with those split ends

43:22.601 --> 43:25.501
I could see from all the way
across the Mountain?

43:25.503 --> 43:28.237
It's a good thing Nick's dad
replaced you with me.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.306
Now team Swift has
a chance of <i>winning.</i>

43:31.609 --> 43:33.710
We'll see about that.
Mm-hmm.

43:39.249 --> 43:41.117
Split ends?

43:41.119 --> 43:43.152
She started it.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.154
You want to show Skye Sailor
what you're made of?

43:45.156 --> 43:46.456
Stop trading insults
back and forth

43:46.458 --> 43:48.424
and beat her at her own game.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.593
Over there.

43:52.262 --> 43:53.863
You're right.

43:56.634 --> 44:00.570

44:23.928 --> 44:27.196
<i>â™ª as when I'm soaring</i>
<i>through the air... â™ª</i>

44:29.266 --> 44:30.600
this is your idea of working?

44:30.602 --> 44:32.301
Yes, actually.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.304
Donald here was in desperate
need of a mani-pedi.

44:35.306 --> 44:36.939
A what?
Trust me.

44:36.941 --> 44:39.242
Depression is no excuse
for cuticles like his.

44:39.244 --> 44:43.212
Okay, boy. Go take those
babies for a test drive.

44:43.214 --> 44:44.947
(SQUEALING)

44:44.949 --> 44:46.683
KAYLA: See?

44:46.685 --> 44:49.218
Everybody feels better
when they've had a makeover.

44:49.220 --> 44:52.455
Which reminds me, I have
a project to attend to.

44:55.225 --> 44:58.294
<i>â™ª So here we go</i>

44:58.296 --> 45:01.764

It does.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.562
After about fifty more times.

45:37.434 --> 45:38.501

47:17.635 --> 47:18.701
You like it?

47:18.703 --> 47:19.969
I love it.

47:19.971 --> 47:22.505
And clearly, so do the dogs.

47:23.941 --> 47:26.042
This must have cost a fortune.

47:26.044 --> 47:27.376
WILL: Not for Kayla.

47:27.378 --> 47:29.679
She's a bargain-hunting
machine.

47:29.681 --> 47:33.082
Well, you two
make a great team.

47:33.084 --> 47:37.086
Hey, have you seen the dog brushes?
Yes. I washed them.

47:37.088 --> 47:40.957
Rufus did a number
on the large ones.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.959
I thought you were
allergic to dog hair.

47:42.961 --> 47:46.462
I'm just allergic
to bad hair in general.

47:46.464 --> 47:49.398
And right now,
Rufus is one up on <i>you.</i>

47:49.400 --> 47:51.968
You kiddin' me?
I like my look.

47:51.970 --> 47:54.070
Yeah? And what look
is that?

47:54.072 --> 47:56.706
Shaggy dog?
You love it.

47:56.708 --> 48:00.042
Okay. You just keep
tellin' yourself that.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.180
Hey, why don't you two
call it a day?

48:04.182 --> 48:05.748
You sure?
Yeah.

48:05.750 --> 48:08.117
I can close up here.
Go have fun.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.753
All right.
I'll be right back.

48:12.089 --> 48:14.824
Thank you, Kayla.
Of course.

48:14.826 --> 48:17.793
No. I mean,
thank you for Will.

48:17.795 --> 48:21.564
I haven't seen him this happy
since back when he was competing.

48:21.566 --> 48:24.600
After his accident, I didn't know
if he'd ever be the same again,

48:24.602 --> 48:27.103
but he's got
his old smile back.

48:27.105 --> 48:29.005
Thank you.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.745
Check this place out.

48:55.165 --> 48:58.034
Have you ever noticed how sometimes
that Mountain looks really...

48:58.036 --> 48:59.635
Scary?

48:59.637 --> 49:01.938
Yeah.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.172
Tyson's peak <i>is </i> scary.

49:03.174 --> 49:05.808
Ice, wind, jagged rocks,

49:05.810 --> 49:08.611
75-foot drop
off the vertical face.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.546
It's intense.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.548
Some people want to
snowboard down it,

49:12.550 --> 49:16.052
but you can't get up there
without a helicopter.

49:16.054 --> 49:19.055
Well, has anyone ever tried?

49:19.057 --> 49:21.757
Yeah. Tyson.

49:23.060 --> 49:25.061
They never found his body.

49:27.130 --> 49:29.198
(BOTH LAUGH)

49:29.200 --> 49:32.234
No, but seriously,
snowboarding down Tyson's peak

49:32.236 --> 49:34.236
is... It's impossible.

49:36.106 --> 49:37.673
Nothing's impossible.

49:41.178 --> 49:43.612
So tell me honestly,

49:43.614 --> 49:46.182
what do you think our chances
are at Fire and Ice?

49:46.184 --> 49:48.184
I'll admit,
at first it was shaky,

49:48.186 --> 49:51.687
but you guys are starting to look
like a real threat out there.

49:53.790 --> 49:55.591
Because...

49:55.593 --> 49:57.026
I've been thinking
about something

49:57.028 --> 49:59.595
that could make our team
an even bigger threat.

49:59.597 --> 50:01.998
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.100
You.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.237
Me?

50:10.574 --> 50:12.274
I think you should
compete with us.

50:12.276 --> 50:14.110
That wasn't a part of our deal.

50:14.112 --> 50:18.047
I know, but Will, I've
seen you out in the snow.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.915
You look like you belong there.

50:19.917 --> 50:23.152
I've never seen anyone
who loves it like you do.

50:23.154 --> 50:25.121
You need to get back out there.

50:25.123 --> 50:26.922
I don't think so, Kayla.

50:26.924 --> 50:29.125
Come <i>on.</i>

50:29.127 --> 50:32.561
I mean, you heard your mom,
we make a great team!

50:32.563 --> 50:35.898
So let's make it official and let's
take down the Swifts together.

50:40.037 --> 50:43.906
Just... Promise me that you're
gonna think about it, okay?

50:45.776 --> 50:47.943
Okay. Good night.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.245
Good night.

52:21.404 --> 52:24.740
MADELINE: I spoke with
Will Cloud's mom last night.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.076
She said Kayla's doing great
at the dog spa,

52:27.078 --> 52:29.044
and I guess Will
is coaching their team.

52:29.046 --> 52:32.314
RICHARD: Yeah, I heard that
she's working really hard.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.351
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

52:35.353 --> 52:38.687
Well, I hate to see her
try so hard only to fail.

52:38.689 --> 52:41.724
Isn't there any chance
she might win?

52:42.993 --> 52:45.161
Against the Swift team?

52:45.163 --> 52:48.130
Honey, that's impossible.

52:53.003 --> 52:54.904
Nothing's impossible.

53:00.443 --> 53:03.279
I want you to teach me
the Cloud 9.

53:03.281 --> 53:05.948
And I want world peace.
Can you get me leash?

53:07.951 --> 53:10.920
You said it yourself, Will.
I've made real progress.

53:10.922 --> 53:12.054
You have.

53:12.056 --> 53:15.824
Okay. So then
what's the problem?

53:15.826 --> 53:19.395
I mean, you're my coach,
right? Coach me.

53:19.397 --> 53:21.964
It's not that simple.

53:23.767 --> 53:25.968
You don't believe in me.

53:25.970 --> 53:28.704
You're just like my dad.

53:28.706 --> 53:31.740
After all this, you still think
I'm all style and no substance.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.943
You've got it all wrong.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.911
It's not about whether
I believe in you...

53:35.913 --> 53:37.980
it's about whether you
believe in yourself!

53:39.416 --> 53:40.849
What do you mean?

53:42.852 --> 53:45.020
Up on that Mountain,

53:45.022 --> 53:47.056
when it's just you
and your board,

53:47.058 --> 53:49.992
it doesn't matter
what anyone else thinks.

53:49.994 --> 53:54.096
You cannot be afraid...
not even for a second.

53:54.098 --> 53:57.099
It takes no fear.

53:58.868 --> 54:00.135
And you're just not there yet.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.304
Do you think that's
what happened to you?

54:02.306 --> 54:04.840
You wiped out because
you were afraid?

54:04.842 --> 54:07.476
Will, I watched your video.

54:07.478 --> 54:11.847
I saw you out on the half-pipe
with that big smile on your face.

54:11.849 --> 54:14.016
I mean, you belong there.

54:14.018 --> 54:18.053
I mean, the Cloud 9 could be a
second chance for both of us.

54:21.958 --> 54:23.759
You're still not ready.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.995
I have done everything
that you've shown me!

54:25.997 --> 54:27.930

Oh, but my dad said he called
you weeks ago to schedule this.

55:07.104 --> 55:09.238
I'm gonna have to
give him a call.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.540
He's gonna be pretty upset that
I interrupted his meeting.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.175

to learn the Cloud 9.

<i>â™ª My makeup's fly,</i>
<i>all I need now â™ª</i>

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:34.629
<i>â™ª is to find a good time</i>
<i>there you go! Bigger!</i>

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.532
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:40.735
<i>â™ª Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah â™ª</i>

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:44.472
<i>â™ª tasty like a chili pepper,</i>
<i>can't you take the heat? â™ª</i>

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:47.809
<i>â™ª be ready for a dancer</i>
<i>if you come along with me â™ª</i>

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:52.614

<i>feeling so free... â™ª</i>

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.816
<i>â™ª</i>

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:57.185

<i>â™ª yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah â™ª</i>

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:10.131
how am I supposed
to compete with <i>that?</i>

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:16.938
Are we still talking
about snowboarding?

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.207
What else would we
be talking about?

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.543
NICK: Great run, Skye.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.979
Forget it.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.581
Let's start on the Cloud 9.

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:35.490
<i>â™ª The worried days</i>

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.192

<i>â™ª another day, yeah</i>

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:40.929
<i>â™ª no more waitin'</i>

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:43.765
part one. You got it?

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.667
Yeah.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.535
<i>â™ª There's more to life</i>
<i>than passing time â™ª</i>

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.170
<i>â™ª I'm getting deeper</i>

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.572
<i>â™ª yeah, it's gettin' nearer</i>

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.674
you got it, Kayla.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.776
<i>â™ª I can't help it</i>

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.679
<i>â™ª I'll always be a dreamer</i>

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.566
you gotta get more tuck.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.869
<i>â™ª Oh oh, oh oh oh</i>

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.774
<i>â™ª isn't fair</i>
<i>how much I stress â™ª</i>

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:28.109

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna stop

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.568
Wait. Your board.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.270
<i>â™ª The way I'm feelin'</i>

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:58.206

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna stop

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.198
Yeah.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.600
Um...

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:29.304
I think I just need
to take a break.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.805
Maybe get some food.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.675
Get my energy back.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.243
Okay.

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.987
I'm getting this, right?

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.790
Yeah. You just gotta
get that grab.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.828
Okay, great.
Are you coming?

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.264
I'll catch up with you.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.099
Okay.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.975
Gotta hand it to you, Cloud.

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.776
Team's lookin'...Better.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:10.879
Thanks.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.647
Especially Kayla.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.948
She is one determined girl.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:18.886
Once she gets an idea
in her head, that's it.

01:09:18.889 --> 01:09:21.788
Like learning the Cloud 9, that
was probably her idea, wasn't it?

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:24.859
She can handle it.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:28.095
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about <i>you.</i>

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:32.066
It's bad enough the Cloud 9
ended your career,

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:34.135
but if Kayla doesn't pull
it off and she gets hurt,

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.371
that'll be on you.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.048
All right, here we go.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.050
Backside 5. Take your time!

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.023
Okay, crippler 7!

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.824
Up... Top...

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.159
Nice!

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.263
All right, Cloud 9.

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:04.032
Double cork. One...

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:06.935
Two...

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:10.405
Uhhh!

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.440
Ohhh!

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.442
Did you see that?

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:17.378
That trick Kayla's working on,
what is that?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.080
That's the Cloud 9.

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:21.249
She can't actually
pull that off.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:23.751
Not yet, but I wouldn't
count her out.

01:10:24.513 --> 01:10:26.288
You said you could beat her.

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:32.093
Yeah. And you said she was a
pampered princess with no talent.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.395
But you were wrong.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.397
That girl can ride.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.006
You're hesitating!

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:47.275
I can see it in your turns!

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:50.411
You know the moves,
but you're not attacking!

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:54.315
Okay. So then...

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:56.851
I'll go again.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.286
No.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.892
That's it.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.395
We're out of time.
You're just not ready.

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:11.199
Are you giving up on me?

01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:15.169
I'm not gonna teach you this
move just to watch you get hurt.

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:18.039
It's not worth it.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.842
What's not worth it?

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:23.845
I think we both know what this
competition is really about for you.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.179
What?!

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:29.050
That little hand-holding stunt
you pulled in school?

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:32.053
I think it's pretty obvious all you
care about is winning Nick back.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:33.955
That's not true.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.792
I mean, things are
so different now.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:45.199
They're not different enough.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.335
We're done.

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:50.271
Yeah, we're done.

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:53.308
I need to stop wasting my time
with guys who don't believe in me.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:16.230
I'm in this
one hundred percent.

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:20.168
And I don't care if Nick
or my dad...

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:24.105
Or anyone else thinks that
I can't win at Fire and Ice.

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:27.241
But I need you
to believe in me.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.478
I believe in you.

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.301
Kayla.

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:56.971
You don't look happy to see me.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:58.506
Yeah.
Can you blame me?

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.342
(CHUCKLES) No, I can't.

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:02.610
And that's what
I want to talk to you about.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:05.346
Listen, I owe you an apology.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:08.349
I should never have kicked
you off the Swift team.

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:11.252
I'm man enough to admit
I made a mistake,

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:14.956
and I'm just hoping
you'll give me another chance.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:18.092
'Cause I want you
competing with us tomorrow.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.294
What? Swift snowboarding
has a chance

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:22.463
to set the world on fire.

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.565
I want you to be part of that.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:27.935
I want you wearing
a Swift jacket tomorrow.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:30.304
Are you serious?
Yes.

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.107
But what about Will?
And our team?

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.344
Oh, please. But let's talk
about that after Fire and Ice.

01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:38.646
Right now, this is about <i>you...</i>

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:41.649
And whether you want to be part of a
team that's gonna put you on the map

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:44.385
as the most well known
female boarder

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:47.155
on the national circuit.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.124
Think about it.

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:52.126
Okay?
Okay.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:55.229
I hope you make
the right decision.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:56.397
All right?

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.451
All right,
what do you guys think?

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:18.719
See any lucky owls
outside, Sam?

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:20.621
Hey, bro, we don't need luck.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:21.722
Yeah, he's right.

victory, straight up.

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:30.498
I, uh, I think I can
help you with that.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.599
KAYLA: I'm here!

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.034
Hey, there you are.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.469
Hi.
Hey.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.609
As of last night, Kayla
rejoined the Swift team.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:47.515
I'm sorry.

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:49.550

What are you doing?

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.459
I forgot to turn in
my Swift gear.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:00.995
I couldn't wear it anyway.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:04.232
I mean, teal is just...
So last season.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:06.133
You're gonna regret that.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.668
You're... you're...
hey, Kayla.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.438
SEBASTIAN: Kayla! You had
me worried for a moment.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.573
Sorry, but it's gonna take a whole
lot more than a new uniform

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:13.741
to get rid of me.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.776
Oh, they came just in time!

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:21.649

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.088

go find a good spot to watch.

for her to beat Skye Sailor
for the women's title.

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.712
Kayla.
Dad?

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.082
I owe you an apology.

01:20:55.084 --> 01:20:57.718
When I saw you
up there tonight...

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:02.389

I'd underestimated you.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.828
I'm sorry for that.
It's just...

Ohh.

my little girl...

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:18.606
you've really grown up.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.010

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.885
Come here, hurry up.
Check this out.

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:32.620
You see that?

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.922
Huh? All that
sappy fatherly pride

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:36.657
is gonna take the edge off her

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:40.094
right before she drops in.
That's gonna help us.

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:42.930
How's a father supporting
his daughter a bad thing?

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:44.632

You know, dad,
believe it or not,

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:59.146
there are some parents that
are proud of their kids

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:00.848
just for who they are,

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:04.652
without making them win
medals or cheat to get ahead.

01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:08.789
Hey. Be careful what you're
doing right now, okay?

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:14.028
Here's an idea.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.096
How about we tell Kayla
what <i>really </i> happened

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:17.631
with her and Will's sled?

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:21.535
Hey. This is not the time
or the place for this,

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:23.671
okay?

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:25.172
Nick.

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.044
I steered Kayla into that sign

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:32.146
so my dad had a reason
to kick her off the team.

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:33.580
What?!

01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:35.549

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.618
Yeah. Like always.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.554
So tell me, dad,
you proud of me now?

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.162
Everything I've
always done for you,

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:51.598
I mean everything, has been to
help you achieve your dream.

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.736
It's not my dream.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.673
It's yours.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.884
I'm sorry, Kayla.

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:29.737
You're going for it,
aren't you?
