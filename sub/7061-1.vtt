01:49.160 --> 01:52.580
Hi, honey, this is your mother.
Listen, I know you're very busy...

01:52.680 --> 01:55.650
with the new job
but please try and call us.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.940
Did you get the birthday sweater we sent?

01:58.040 --> 02:01.010
We'll be home all weekend. Bye.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.340
Howard, Jim here.
We still set for racquet ball on Saturday?

02:05.440 --> 02:08.060
Give me a shout, buddy. Bye-bye.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.060
Hi, it's Wendy. I had this really
intense dream last night, Howie.

02:13.160 --> 02:16.900
I was running my fingers through
your feathers, and all of a sudden...

02:17.000 --> 02:19.740
Well, you better come over tonight...

02:19.840 --> 02:22.300
and I'll show you
what really happened next.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.686
Ciao for now, Howie.

02:28.520 --> 02:34.820
Hey, Ricky's back with you again
for lots more Dance Frenzy excitement!

02:34.920 --> 02:38.500
Here's couple number three,
our lovely Latin dance team...

02:38.600 --> 02:42.700
from Wedford Falls. Charles is
a Machinist First Class in the Navy...

02:42.800 --> 02:47.124
and his darling wife, Madge,
is a blackjack dealer.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.620
Just a super jock dance.
Charles and Madge!

02:54.720 --> 02:59.260
- Come on, let's hear for them, folks.
- What's the matter, George?

02:59.360 --> 03:03.260
Jock itch again? I've got just the thing.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.740
Here. Why not take a shot
of New Shorts Blaster?

03:06.840 --> 03:09.340
It's guaranteed to wipe out
feather fungus...

03:09.440 --> 03:12.460
- in even the most active crotches.
- Shorts Blaster.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.260
In addition, you've won a new car!

03:16.360 --> 03:18.681
- But that's not all.
- Nice...

03:18.800 --> 03:21.860
Oh, Fred, I love you so much.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.884
- It hurts like hell...
- He's dead.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.380
$79.95? Forget it!

03:28.480 --> 03:31.660
$49.99? No way!

03:31.760 --> 03:37.051
I'm crazy and my prices are insane!

03:45.600 --> 03:48.968
Who did they interview this month?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.891
My little airbrushed beauty.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.125
What?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.805
Oh, no, it's a quake!

04:09.320 --> 04:11.641
I can't get up!

04:12.760 --> 04:14.808
What's going on here?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.483
Casey, did you hear something?

04:22.320 --> 04:25.300
I'm such a lucky girl.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.243
I'm in love.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.363
The Cosmos.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.940
Countless worlds upon worlds.
Worlds without end.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.620
In these galaxies
every possible reality exits.

05:20.720 --> 05:26.820
And what is reality on any one world
is mere fantasy on all others.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.448
Here, all is real and all is illusion.

05:32.080 --> 05:37.780
What is, what was and
what will be start here with the words...

05:37.880 --> 05:40.281
"in the beginning there was...

05:41.240 --> 05:43.925
Howard the Duck!"

06:15.640 --> 06:17.404
Boy...!

06:39.840 --> 06:42.500
I'm a dead duck.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.250
Hey, come on!

06:45.080 --> 06:46.650
No!

06:50.360 --> 06:56.163
Hey, Bender, go on in, Frankenweed.
We finally found you a date.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.368
What is this?

07:02.640 --> 07:05.180
Hey! That costume don't fool me.
No kids allowed.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.340
- Come on, Kid.
- Wait a minute, that's my date!

07:07.440 --> 07:09.522
I said out of the way!

07:17.520 --> 07:18.601
No, wait!

07:20.440 --> 07:24.126
You little creep! Get away from my cart,
you filthy degenerate!

07:49.840 --> 07:52.940
- Christ, it touched me!
- What the hell is it?

07:53.040 --> 07:56.886
- I wasn't trying anything! Honest!
- Step on him!

08:15.160 --> 08:16.650
Up and away!

08:24.280 --> 08:26.328
Are you ready for an incredible story?

08:26.440 --> 08:30.047
- Waste it, man, waste it!
- No!

08:52.600 --> 08:55.683
Talk about a rotten day...

09:15.760 --> 09:17.091
Just saw your show!

09:17.200 --> 09:19.260
- Great, thanks.
- Beverly, we love your music.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.966
- Bye now.
- Could I have your autograph on my shirt?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.220
Me too. On my shorts?

09:24.320 --> 09:28.940
- Real charming. Just go away, okay?
- We're talking to you, big rock star!

09:29.040 --> 09:31.660
- Don't try anything!
- Don't go snot nose on us.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.923
- We're your biggest fans.
- Let me go!

09:39.840 --> 09:42.241
Help somebody, help! Help!

09:44.080 --> 09:46.481
Come here, snot nose!

09:47.440 --> 09:51.525
That's it. No more Mr. Nice Duck!

09:56.400 --> 09:58.402
Let the female creature go!

10:00.320 --> 10:05.247
Every duck's got his limit, and you scum
have pushed me over the line.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.884
Jimmy, do you like see what I see?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.220
- A talking duck?
- Yeah. That's it.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.260
I've been doing too much toot.
Shoot! Fly away!

10:16.360 --> 10:20.001
No one laughs at a master of Quack-Foo!

10:23.960 --> 10:25.405
Jimmy, you okay?

10:34.800 --> 10:35.847
Get off me!

10:42.600 --> 10:45.001
You, creep, get out of here!

10:50.520 --> 10:52.140
You're breaking my fingers!

10:52.240 --> 10:57.644
Now, you and baby face
are gonna beat it, right, Mr. Zitz?

10:57.760 --> 11:01.128
Before I get really mad!

11:01.920 --> 11:05.242
Come on! Let's get out of here!

11:06.920 --> 11:11.801
This is obviously no place
for an intelligent, sensitive duck.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.780
This is unreal. I mean, it can't be.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.930
- Thanks.
- You're not really a...

11:21.200 --> 11:22.300
a duck?

11:22.400 --> 11:27.500
You know, this is beginning to seriously
undermine my self-esteem.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.700
I'm sorry, I guess I should thank you
for chasing those guys off.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.980
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure. Terrific.

11:36.080 --> 11:40.940
I just have one giant question.
Where am I?

11:41.040 --> 11:45.180
Oh, well, The lights up there are Ninth Street
and the bus stops at the corner of Powell.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.300
No, no, no, no.
I'm asking, what is this place?

11:49.400 --> 11:52.620
- Cleveland?
- Cleveland? Uh-huh...

11:52.720 --> 11:56.060
That's a perfect weird name
for this planet.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.460
Planet? No, no, that's a city.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.530
The planet's... You don't know the planet?

12:02.920 --> 12:07.700
Oh, well, the planet's called Earth,
I think.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.260
And I'm obviously
in some sort of terrible nightmare.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.460
Oh, yeah? Your nightmare or mine?

12:13.560 --> 12:15.324
Good point.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.325
So, I guess I better be going.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.808
Thanks again.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.045
Bye.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.130
Bye...

13:04.760 --> 13:07.940
Listen... You got someplace to go?

13:08.040 --> 13:13.683
If I had someplace to go,
I certainly wouldn't be in Cleveland.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.604
Come on.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.900
Nice place. Do you pay to live here?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.420
It's cheap.
The manager of my band found it for me.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.380
I suggest you find a new manager.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.620
I'd love to, but we got
this damn contract with this sleazoid.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.041
He won't even give us the money
he owes us.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.561
Come on in.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.580
It's sort of a disaster area.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.700
We've been working on
some new songs, you know.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.340
See, the band's called Cherry Bomb, and...

14:13.440 --> 14:17.604
we've been playing these grungy
mong-holes waiting for our big break.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.980
You don't have any idea
what I'm talking about, do you Mister...

14:23.080 --> 14:25.526
- Hello.
- Duck?

14:26.640 --> 14:30.300
- It's Howard, thank you.
- Right, Howard.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.300
Hi, I'm Beverly.

14:32.400 --> 14:37.531
Listen, would you like
something to eat or drink?

14:38.480 --> 14:41.290
Milk? I could put it in a bowl.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.929
Doll, I don't drink out of bowls.
You got a beer?

14:46.640 --> 14:52.010
Beer? Right, beer, right.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.620
God, I can't believe this.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.260
- I'll put you in a bowl.
- What?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.886
No... Give me a break.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.683
- What's this?
- It's a purse.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.644
- I got it at a swap meet.
- Cute.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.522
- Big one...
- I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.564
It's just that I've never been around a...

15:17.600 --> 15:20.020
I mean, I've never even had
any pets or anything, you know?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.361
They seem like such a hassle.
You know, feeding them...

15:22.480 --> 15:26.140
- cleaning up their little poo-poos.
- I'll try to be careful.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.641
No, I didn't mean that you...

15:30.240 --> 15:32.180
Look, why don't you just sit down...

15:32.280 --> 15:36.660
- Okay, why not?
- And make yourself at home.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.526
- Make myself at home? I wish.
- Listen.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.367
Oh, no, not again!

15:48.360 --> 15:52.570
Howard, it's okay. Are you all right?

15:52.680 --> 15:56.924
- The chair started shaking.
- It was just a big truck going by.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.810
A truck? I knew that.

16:02.840 --> 16:07.084
What I don't know is
what the hell I'm doing here!

16:07.880 --> 16:12.740
It's like a bad trip.
I mean, talk about an identity crisis.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.380
Yeah, what an awful thing to happen.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.180
Howard, I was just kinda wondering...

16:18.280 --> 16:21.260
does everybody
in your planet look like you?

16:21.360 --> 16:25.740
- Obviously, why?
- No reason, just wondered.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.020
So, what do you do back home?
You got a job? You go to school?

16:29.120 --> 16:32.420
- I went to med school for a while.
- You went to med school?

16:32.520 --> 16:34.940
Yeah, my parents wanted me to be a doctor.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.887
Plastic surgeon, making big bucks,
doing big jobs, tail tucks.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.610
- What happened?
- I dropped out.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.940
And I decided to educate myself
in the real world, on the streets.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.340
So, I wrote songs at night
and did construction work by day.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.500
Wow. That sounds great.
You know, I write songs too.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.620
- What kind of...
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.540
It was all a pipe dream.
I got so tired of everyone saying:

17:02.640 --> 17:05.848
"Grow up, Howard". I guess I finally did.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.260
Last month I got
what they call a "promising job".

17:09.359 --> 17:13.569
- Yeah? Doing what?
- Advertising copywriter.

17:15.040 --> 17:21.260
Only two things touch my feathers,
this "Oil of Night Fowl" and him.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.442
I wrote that.

17:23.560 --> 17:28.940
Geez, Howard, it sort of
sounds like you sold out.

17:29.040 --> 17:33.260
Maybe.
But sometimes I still get this feeling...

17:33.360 --> 17:36.980
there's some kind of special destiny
waiting for me.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.460
Howard, that's it.
Maybe that's why you're here.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.620
- What?
- I mean, I believe...

17:40.720 --> 17:42.660
that there are no accidents
in the universe.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.220
Maybe you're here
for some greater purpose.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.563
- Some cosmic cause.
- Are you nuts?

17:49.720 --> 17:52.260
I got no intention of being stranded here.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.442
I gotta get back.

17:55.280 --> 18:01.526
- How, is another matter.
- Yeah, right. We gotta get some help.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.851
But, Howard...

19:06.360 --> 19:08.488
Oh, geez...

19:22.120 --> 19:23.849
Howard...!

19:51.840 --> 19:56.323
What am I gonna do with you... ducky?

20:23.760 --> 20:26.180
- This is humiliating.
- I just don't want people...

20:26.280 --> 20:29.300
- freaking out all over the place.
- What about me?

20:29.400 --> 20:30.970
I'm gonna have to see a psychiatrist...

20:31.080 --> 20:33.660
- every day for the rest of my life.
- Relax, we're almost there.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.809
- Oh, goody.
- Phil's a scientist. He can help.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.100
- Howard, this isn't working.
- Tell me about it.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.180
Can I give you a hand with that?

20:43.280 --> 20:45.260
- No, we're doing...
- What's in the bag?

20:45.360 --> 20:47.420
I'm doing fine, thank you very much.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.648
Let me out of here.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.580
- Excuse me. Can I help with that?
- No!

20:51.680 --> 20:53.125
Yes!

20:53.960 --> 20:55.883
Why are we stopping?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.060
- Hi.
- Hi, Beverly.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.960
We had an appointment.
We got here as fast as we could.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.660
God... Listen, everybody, this is it!
I've just seen it!

21:16.760 --> 21:20.242
It's in there! It's a... it's...

21:22.000 --> 21:27.140
It's... It's nothing!
It's nothing, never mind.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.208
Carry on, Dr. Chapin.

21:38.720 --> 21:43.760
This is amazing. Man's oldest fantasy.

21:44.400 --> 21:51.010
Across a sea of stars! Look up in the sky!

21:51.120 --> 21:54.180
It's a bird! It's a plane!

21:54.280 --> 21:59.860
- No, it's a duck!
- Phil, you gotta help us!

21:59.960 --> 22:03.726
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice ducky.

22:04.360 --> 22:10.970
Me Phil, you Howard. We be friends.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.940
Me Phil, you Howard. We be friends.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.203
Undoubtedly on of Earth's
greatest minds here.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.980
Hey, Phil, don't talk to him like that.
He's just as smart as you are.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.780
- Now I'm really depressed.
- Highly intelligent, perhaps even...

22:28.880 --> 22:31.087
Wait, that's it. We're about to see...

22:31.200 --> 22:34.060
if subject has any abilities
we don't have on Earth, any...

22:34.160 --> 22:39.405
- What?
- ...shall we say, super powers?

22:40.200 --> 22:41.804
Howard!

22:42.880 --> 22:44.291
Can you bend this?

22:45.600 --> 22:48.410
- What are you, crazy?
- Howard...

22:49.280 --> 22:54.860
can you burn a hole through this
with some kind of eye laser?

22:54.960 --> 22:58.260
Can I bite your nose off
with my super bill?

22:58.360 --> 23:01.460
Howard, quit holding out.
I want you to concentrate...

23:01.560 --> 23:06.420
- and read my mind.
- Right. You're thinking:

23:06.520 --> 23:09.808
"They know I'm a phony.
They know I'm a yo-yo."

23:10.920 --> 23:13.180
Tell me if I'm warm on any of these, Phil.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.020
I want you to look into the future
and tell me what you see.

23:17.120 --> 23:21.700
- I see myself walking out that door!
- Yeah, me too.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.860
- No, no, no, wait! You can't leave.
- Yeah, why not?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.100
Because there are papers to be written,
there's research to be done...

23:28.200 --> 23:30.700
and there's symposiums to give,
lecture tours.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.140
Howard, we are on our way
to the Science Hall of Fame.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.380
Look out, Darwin! Look out, Einstein!
Hello, Nobel Prize!

23:37.480 --> 23:39.403
We're not here
to make you famous, Blumburtt.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.220
Beverly, listen,
I never bad-mouthed others...

23:41.320 --> 23:44.290
in the scientific fraternity, but you
bring in an alien in a bag to most guys...

23:44.400 --> 23:45.500
and Whamo! They are talking.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.020
Let's cut him into little pieces
and see what color his organs are.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.340
I just wanna know: A: What I'm doing here?

23:51.440 --> 23:53.340
And B: How I'm gonna get back?

23:53.440 --> 23:55.700
Piece of cake.
A: I'm just the guy to help...

23:55.800 --> 23:59.140
And that's because B,
I've already got a theory.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.700
- What theory?
- Well, this is, of course...

24:01.800 --> 24:05.580
the evolutionary ladder
showing how man progressed...

24:05.680 --> 24:11.300
- from monkey, to me, for instance.
- You consider that progress?

24:11.400 --> 24:15.420
Geez... You're all hairless apes?
That's really disgusting.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.740
Now, I want you both to imagine
somewhere in the universe...

24:19.840 --> 24:23.900
is Howard's world.
Picture it in your mind.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.220
A world almost exactly like ours...

24:26.320 --> 24:29.940
except that the progenitor
of the dominant species...

24:30.040 --> 24:35.780
- was not a monkey but a duck!
- Some theory...

24:35.880 --> 24:37.660
Every school duck knows this stuff!

24:37.760 --> 24:42.260
And as duck climbed up
the evolutionary ladder...

24:42.360 --> 24:46.900
he said adios to his wings.
His mental capacity increases.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.100
He begins to develop. Beverly?

24:50.200 --> 24:53.940
- Shopping malls?
- No, tribes.

24:54.040 --> 24:59.900
Cro-Magnon Duck,
who ultimately evolves into Howard.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.900
Hey, Blumburtt? Blumburtt?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.020
- Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.420
- What?
- Don't move! Don't breathe!

25:06.520 --> 25:08.860
Did you finish cleaning
up the specimen lab?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.540
Almost finished.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.900
Well, get down to the
Marine Lift Exhibit with a mop.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.128
Some kid upchucked
all over the fern fossils.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.340
Right. Good as done, Dr. Chapin.

25:18.440 --> 25:23.100
So, Philsey, you are
a scientist or a janitor?

25:23.200 --> 25:24.660
I'm a lab assistant.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.740
- That's terrific! Just perfect.
- Yep, I'm out of here.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.980
Look, it's just a temporary job
until I finish school and get my own museum.

25:30.080 --> 25:34.847
- Yeah, stuffed you'd make a great exhibit.
- Howard! Howard, wait!

25:36.680 --> 25:39.060
- Typical hairless ape.
- Howard, look, come on.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.100
Don't flutter off in a huff!
Beverly, listen...

25:41.200 --> 25:44.900
I've got some important matters
to clean up here, but I'll call you tonight.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.860
I'll figure out a way
to help Howard, I swear.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.281
- Just don't show him to anybody else!
- Yeah, they look hungry.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.820
- Get them a banana.
- Hide him! Take him to a movie!

25:53.920 --> 25:57.083
- I didn't know where else to go for help.
- Inside, Blumburtt.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.300
- Coming! Coming!
- Howard, why are you so pissed off?

26:00.400 --> 26:04.820
Why? Listen, if you got blasted
millions of miles through space...

26:04.920 --> 26:06.460
ended up on another planet...

26:06.560 --> 26:11.380
and were given an I.Q. test by a janitor,
you'd be pissed off too!

26:11.480 --> 26:13.580
Look, maybe you are trapped
in a world you never made...

26:13.680 --> 26:17.500
but I got problems of my own.
My whole career is falling apart.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.220
Your career? What about my life?

26:21.320 --> 26:25.100
- I'm stranded here, ship wrecked!
- Look at this wonderful exhibit.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.940
You see what I mean?
I'm a freak. An outcast.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.060
- It's so life-like and realistic.
- Bug off.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.562
- Excuse me?
- I said, "beat it".

26:36.920 --> 26:39.420
Mutants. You, too.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.860
- Leave me alone!
- What?

26:42.960 --> 26:47.090
I don't need any more
of your sympathy, your charity!

26:48.760 --> 26:51.969
Okay. Okay, fine.
I mean, I just found something...

26:53.400 --> 26:57.980
I meet somebody in a pretty weird
predicament and I was trying to help.

26:58.080 --> 27:03.300
But if that's the way you want it,
then so long, ducky!

27:03.400 --> 27:07.940
- Don't shed any tears over me, toots!
- You can wallow in your own self-pity!

27:08.040 --> 27:09.940
Right! Well, who needs you?

27:10.040 --> 27:13.442
- I don't need anybody!
- Yeah, right.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.761
Yeah...

27:19.920 --> 27:25.340
Damn it! I can't sit here on my tail feathers
feeling sorry for myself.

27:25.440 --> 27:31.925
I've got to think about practical matters:
Food, shelter... a job.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.340
Now you do know why you were sent to me?

27:44.440 --> 27:47.364
My continuing streak of bad luck?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.260
You've been sent to me because
I'm famous for finding jobs...

27:52.360 --> 27:55.420
for little slackers like you.
That's right.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.420
They send me all the psycho cases.
All the misfits.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.540
All the phonies and the fakers...

28:01.640 --> 28:04.420
who think that by traipsing in here
looking outlandish...

28:04.520 --> 28:06.740
they're not gonna be able to find work!

28:06.840 --> 28:10.380
It's my fault I gotta shoplift
at the little tyke section of goodwill?

28:10.480 --> 28:13.980
I'm not talking about your clothes,
I'm talking about your face.

28:14.080 --> 28:14.740
Hey...

28:14.840 --> 28:17.540
You think that by looking controversial...

28:17.640 --> 28:22.260
you're never gonna find a job
and just go on collecting unemployment...

28:22.360 --> 28:24.660
and living happy on the public dough.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.525
Well, dude, you've got
another think coming!

28:27.640 --> 28:31.406
Because Cora Mae
always places her interviewee.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.260
I'm gonna find your ass a job.

28:34.360 --> 28:40.527
That'll wipe that snarl right off your face,
little whatever you is.

28:41.400 --> 28:46.361
In fact, I think I got
just the position for you!

28:52.520 --> 28:57.686
I got a feeling you're gonna take
to this job like a duck to water.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.048
Towels, lotion?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.445
Antibiotics?

29:20.040 --> 29:22.168
It must be mating season.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.003
Creepy little dude.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.400
Hey! Shorty!

29:33.120 --> 29:36.540
It's Howard, thank you,
and I'm taking a break.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.540
Pardon me, Your Aloneness...

29:39.640 --> 29:44.340
but we seem to have
a plugged up airjet in number five.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.020
- And?
- And...?

29:47.120 --> 29:51.820
And since you are supposed
to be the water expert I asked for...

29:51.920 --> 29:55.020
you are going to fix it!

29:55.120 --> 29:56.700
Oh, no...

29:56.800 --> 29:59.500
No, no, no, wait, wait.
I got a better idea! Wait, wait!

29:59.600 --> 30:03.605
- I can't swim!
- Whoops, kid, guess I slipped.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.882
Don't mind me.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.940
I leave that creepy little dude
in here to clean this place up...

30:24.040 --> 30:26.088
How am I supposed to run a class...

30:27.400 --> 30:28.970
Guess I slipped.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.300
Just came by to tell you:

30:32.400 --> 30:34.641
I quit!

31:14.080 --> 31:16.700
Excuse me. Getting off. My stop.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.282
Hi, there. How are you? Good to see you.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.527
Yeah, same to you!

31:24.080 --> 31:25.923
Urban jungle! Geez!

31:27.400 --> 31:29.164
- What is that?
- That's a duck...

31:29.280 --> 31:32.500
- What is that thing?
- That's a duck, man!

31:32.600 --> 31:36.100
Forecasting our week of fair weather
for you duck hunters...

31:36.200 --> 31:39.100
and for our lucky field reporter,
Steve Cannelli.

31:39.200 --> 31:42.900
Well, Bob, it's time to dust off those
decoys and practice that squawking...

31:43.000 --> 31:45.220
because duck hunting season
has officially opened.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.940
- Duck hunting?
- The Live Wild Commission...

31:47.040 --> 31:49.340
has actually doubled the limit
of ducks that can be shot.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.780
- Shot?
- Reaction of the local hunters...

31:50.880 --> 31:52.848
has been enthusiastic.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.700
This duck has come to America
with Duck-A-Roni.

31:57.800 --> 31:58.608
No!

31:59.600 --> 32:03.002
But if every hunter could blast
15 of those **** in the sky...

32:05.720 --> 32:08.564
Hey, buddy, what's the rush?

33:52.040 --> 33:53.929
This way is too depressing.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.007
Okay... Give me a beat!

34:00.240 --> 34:02.004
One, two, three, four!

34:07.440 --> 34:10.284
Honey, I love you! I love you! Come on!

34:10.400 --> 34:13.722
I'm right here. Beverly,
I'm yours after the show. Alright.

34:17.199 --> 34:22.491
- Here's the money for the girls.
- I'll make sure they get it.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.820
- Yeah, I'll bet. When?
- When?

34:25.920 --> 34:28.844
When Bodacious Beverly
stops holding on to me.

34:28.960 --> 34:33.362
I'm gonna invite her up to my place tonight
for a little career manipulation.

34:35.280 --> 34:40.571
I guess you must be the girls' manager.
And if you are...

34:40.679 --> 34:44.139
I don't like the way
you're talking about Beverly.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.620
And I want the girls' money!

34:46.719 --> 34:50.620
- Ritchie? Would you... What is that?
- Oh, look, Ginger...

34:50.719 --> 34:53.179
I warned you when you got into
rock management...

34:53.280 --> 34:55.659
you'd be dealing with entertainment types.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.420
You know, different strokes and all that?

34:58.520 --> 35:02.923
Hey, hey, different life styles is one thing,
different life forms is another.

35:09.480 --> 35:13.180
I'm not in a real good mood
tonight, Ginger.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.860
I want the girls' money.

35:15.960 --> 35:20.204
Now, is this gonna be easy...

35:21.240 --> 35:25.980
- or is this gonna be trouble?
- Hey, Ritchie...

35:26.080 --> 35:29.860
tell it to go away.
I'm not up all my barnyard languages.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.500
Okay, duck, out! You're gone!
You're history!

35:33.600 --> 35:37.127
You little wise pecker! Arrivederci, duck!

35:41.000 --> 35:45.180
- Mallard in the side pocket.
- Adios, quack man.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.282
Very nicely done.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.326
Hey, what's going on out there now?

36:05.600 --> 36:11.767
- Alright, now it's my turn!
- Hey, come on, duck! Take your best shot!

36:14.440 --> 36:16.249
- You got it!
- Ritchie!

36:26.160 --> 36:27.764
Duck-kabob!

36:32.120 --> 36:33.246
No!

36:38.640 --> 36:43.260
No earring in your other ear?
I'll just make the hole myself.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.420
No, please, man, no. Man, please! Don't!

36:45.520 --> 36:47.340
- The money!
- Sure. Sure, here!

36:47.440 --> 36:49.488
You take the money!
Take it! It's yours! Take it!

36:49.600 --> 36:52.900
And, you're no longer their manager!

36:53.000 --> 36:55.100
Listen, okay.
Everybody in here is a witness.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.860
I'm letting the girls
out of their contract, okay?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.740
Tell your goons to stay back!
I'm warning you!

36:59.840 --> 37:01.900
- Stay back, Ritchie!
- I bite your face...

37:02.000 --> 37:04.820
- you're a dead man, Ginger!
- What are you talking about?

37:04.920 --> 37:07.660
Space rabies!

37:07.760 --> 37:10.220
- Ritchie, is that a real disease?
- I don't know, Ging.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.220
I heard something about that on the news.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.740
That's right, space rabies!
Yeah, one bite...

37:16.840 --> 37:21.243
and it's agonizing death in 15 seconds.
Bite, bite, bite!

37:27.240 --> 37:30.801
We're all music lovers, huh? God...

37:32.080 --> 37:34.003
What a dive.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.460
- Those guys are a bunch of fools.
- Obviously the wrong crowd.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.940
I'm running out of sticks
to throw at people! Sucks!

37:42.040 --> 37:44.850
- Now who?
- Look, tell him to go away.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.809
Down here, doll.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.220
- Is Beverly in?
- Wow!

37:54.320 --> 37:57.085
Geez, you must be K.C.!

37:58.000 --> 38:01.380
- Meet Howard.
- Wow! Hi, oh, Howie.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.860
We've heard so much about you.
Of course, we didn't believe it.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.122
Yo, how weird.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.380
- Hi ducky.
- Hi toots.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.960
How's the world been treating you?

38:15.600 --> 38:19.060
- Guess.
- I was worried about you.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.660
- I missed you.
- Well, sex appeal...

38:21.760 --> 38:26.561
- Some guys got it... and some guys don't.
- Howard...

38:27.440 --> 38:33.243
Listen, I'm sorry we fought.
You're the only friend I've got here.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.420
Hi, sorry I missed the show.
I came to watch you undress, though.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.820
And I brought a pizza.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.604
Howard!

38:47.280 --> 38:49.180
Boy!

38:49.280 --> 38:50.340
Thank God you're back.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.522
I've been working on
the mystery of your arrival.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.140
What's he doing here?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.500
Well, he and Ronette have sort
of got back together.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.860
I don't know who's more desperate
for dates, you or me.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.380
What?

39:01.480 --> 39:04.060
Anyway, Howard, I was talking
to some astrolo-physicists.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.500
You know, the guys who discovered
that Aztecs came from Mars?

39:06.600 --> 39:08.820
- Well, these guys concluded...
- No!

39:08.920 --> 39:10.580
...that you arrived here
in a space craft millions of years ago...

39:10.680 --> 39:13.460
- and must've remained frozen in ice.
- Go away!

39:13.560 --> 39:15.927
- Ronette, could you shut this boy up?
- Howard...

39:16.040 --> 39:18.740
- What's a pizza?
- It's a circular Italian food object.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.740
Howard, I didn't buy that theory either,
so I did some research...

39:21.840 --> 39:24.980
and I discovered an ancient race
of large ducks worshipped by...

39:25.080 --> 39:29.540
- primitive Somoans.
- Leave me alone!

39:29.640 --> 39:32.660
I was barking up the wrong tree.
I knew that.

39:32.760 --> 39:36.740
But tonight I am getting concrete
evidence about how you got here.

39:36.840 --> 39:40.540
- Yeah...
- Wait a minute. Oh, I gotta make a call.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.740
- Phil?
- No sex now, I'm working.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.081
Got a place to stay tonight?

39:50.040 --> 39:52.780
Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot.

39:52.880 --> 39:56.340
- I had a little talk with your manager Ginger?
- You talked to that slime?

39:56.440 --> 39:59.460
- What for?
- I got your money from him.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.460
Ducky, I can't believe this!

40:01.560 --> 40:05.900
I also got him to agree that it was time
for him to step aside as your manager.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.900
What? You got rid of Ginger?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.740
- Mr. Duck, you're wonderful.
- Yeah...

40:10.840 --> 40:12.569
This is it! I'm out of here!

40:12.680 --> 40:14.020
- Good.
- Howard!

40:14.120 --> 40:17.900
I'm about to meet secretly with my colleague,
and he's bringing The Feather.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.020
What feather?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.140
- What are you talking...
- If it matches...

40:21.240 --> 40:23.860
- it'll be the answer to all your problems.
- Matches? No, you don't!

40:23.960 --> 40:25.060
Stay away from me!

40:25.160 --> 40:26.844
- You leave him alone!
- Let me through!

40:27.680 --> 40:29.125
God, get a grip!

40:29.680 --> 40:32.540
I'm about to unravel
the mystery of your arrival!

40:32.640 --> 40:35.780
- Come back here, you hairless ape!
- You'll have time to thank me later!

40:35.880 --> 40:38.660
- Get out of here, geek!
- We're gonna be famous.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.380
- Are you okay?
- Ah, it's just my pride.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.323
We'll go home, ducky.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.607
Alright.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.370
Hey!

41:42.120 --> 41:45.300
- Little tune I never finished.
- You play pretty good.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.940
I had a group in high school.
Howard and the Heartbreakers.

41:49.040 --> 41:55.127
Oh, heavy, Howard, very heavy.
Maybe you should be our manager.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.282
Wait a second.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.900
Maybe you're just the kind
of bizarro-influence we need.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.340
- Forget it. No more jobs here.
- I think you'd be a great manager.

42:07.440 --> 42:11.660
- I'm gonna suggest it to the girls.
- I've given up trying to assimilate.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.420
I've gotta get back to my own kind.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.921
Although...

42:17.760 --> 42:20.300
I have developed a greater appreciation...

42:20.400 --> 42:23.980
for the female version
of the human anatomy.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.731
Howard, you really are the worst.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.767
Come on, let's watch David Letterman.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.286
Come on.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.500
Okey-dokey.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.126
- You know, I got a feeling
my life's really gonna change...

42:37.240 --> 42:42.180
- since you fell into it, ducky.
- Yeah, well, I'm glad somebody's happy.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.180
If I could just get my career
back on course...

42:44.280 --> 42:46.740
I'd only have the old standard worry left.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.940
- What's that?
- I just can't seem to find the right man.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.567
Maybe it's not a man
you should be looking for.

42:56.280 --> 43:00.180
You think I might find happiness
in the animal kingdom, ducky?

43:00.280 --> 43:06.731
Like they say, doll, love's strange.
We could always give it a try.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.250
Okay...

43:14.360 --> 43:17.300
Let's go for it, Mr. Macho.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.529
What do you mean, okay? It was a joke.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.580
Listen, I'm pretty tired.

43:25.680 --> 43:28.700
It's just that you're
so incredibly soft and cuddly.

43:28.800 --> 43:31.340
Bev, let's be realistic.

43:31.440 --> 43:35.180
I mean, my apartment's
zillions of miles from here.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.780
You're three feet taller that I am.

43:37.880 --> 43:41.805
I just can't resist
your intense animal magnetism.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.300
Whoops...

43:45.400 --> 43:49.060
Anyway, where will it all lead?
Marriage? Kids?

43:49.160 --> 43:51.700
A house in the suburbs?

43:51.800 --> 43:53.460
Let's just face it.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.689
- It's fate.
- No, it's not!

43:57.960 --> 44:01.851
- I've got a headache.
- And I've got the aspirin.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.740
Be gentle.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.844
Just one good night kiss, sweet ducky?

44:09.680 --> 44:12.251
Come on, Howard, I was just kidding.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.884
Good night.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.020
My God.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.860
This relationship...
it defies all the laws of nature.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.246
No, it doesn't.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.251
This is not what you think.
We're just very good friends.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.260
- Phil?
- I'm sorry. The door was open.

44:45.360 --> 44:48.500
- Who the hell are they?
- This is my friend Carter...

44:48.600 --> 44:52.889
and this is Dr. Walter Jenning.
And I told them all about you, Howard.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.700
You were obviously right.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.980
- Show, show him the evidence.
- What evidence?

44:58.080 --> 45:01.780
We tested them, and they're both
from the same fowl.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.006
You, Howard.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.420
- My feathers?
- Howard, Howard, don't go beserk!

45:07.520 --> 45:09.620
- No!
- On my planet, we never say die...

45:09.720 --> 45:11.700
- we say kill!
- Now, wait a minute.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.326
Listen to me, small visitor.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.601
I can explain how you got here.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.340
Dr. Jenning is in charge of the
Astro-Physics Lab at Dyna-Technics.

45:23.440 --> 45:26.046
- Now, on the night of September 18th.
- That's the night Howard landed.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.900
Yes, now on that night
we were initiating our first...

45:29.000 --> 45:32.700
- full scale test of the Laser Spectra scope.
- This was shot during the experiment.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.883
It was just a routine procedure
meant to measure...

45:36.000 --> 45:38.660
the density of the gases
that surround the Alpha Centauri.

45:38.760 --> 45:43.340
However, part way through the experiment,
there was a deviation and...

45:43.440 --> 45:46.900
we lost control
of the laser spectra scope.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.340
- What do you mean, "lost control"?
- Some unknown force...

45:51.440 --> 45:54.220
was re-directing the laser beam
from its original target...

45:54.320 --> 45:57.660
- so that it hit your planet instead.
- Hit my planet?

45:57.760 --> 46:01.300
How about hitting my living room?
Talk about an invasion of privacy.

46:01.400 --> 46:04.380
When the beam hit, you must
have been caught up in a massive...

46:04.480 --> 46:08.140
energy inversion, which literally
dragged you through space...

46:08.240 --> 46:10.620
back to the power source here on earth.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.460
- Radical.
- In the lab that night...

46:13.560 --> 46:16.723
we saw a single feather fall.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.100
We weren't aware that the rest
of you, Howard...

46:25.200 --> 46:28.060
had landed in that alley
just two miles away.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.767
- Any questions?
- Yeah. Where are my pants?

46:33.200 --> 46:35.060
- Howard, where you going?
- To this lab of theirs.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.460
- What for?
- To hop back on board that laser thing.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.500
Then all you have to do is hit the reverse
lever to send me back home. Right?

46:42.600 --> 46:45.060
Well, we hadn't considered
reversing the process.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.580
- I don't think it's feasible.
- Me, either.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.700
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate...

46:48.800 --> 46:51.340
- a strong enough hyper-charge...
- You can't do that.

46:51.440 --> 46:54.060
You mean the reflex mode
might provoke a total reversal?

46:54.160 --> 46:56.100
- It just might be possible.
- It won't work.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.380
- Yeah.
- Sir.

46:57.480 --> 47:01.220
Don't, don't listen to them, Howard.
I have got you booked on A.M. Cleveland.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.820
We can get the cover
of Science Digest. We, we...

47:03.920 --> 47:05.940
- Butt Out, four-eyes.
- Yeah.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.300
Look, you guys,
could you really send him back?

47:08.400 --> 47:12.060
If we did, we could establish
a continuing link between our planets.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.448
But, he would have to leave tonight
while the alignment still exists.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.700
We can't afford to wait.

47:16.800 --> 47:19.020
You mean I'm finally gonna breeze
this fly trap?

47:19.120 --> 47:22.020
Ducky, this is what you wanted.
You're going home.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.420
- Yeah.
- Right.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.420
Carter, call Larry have him set up
the initiation procedure.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.620
Tell him I'll meet him at the lab right away.
You and Blumburtt can bring Howard.

47:29.720 --> 47:33.540
You are about to make history
a second time, my little friend.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.802
Thanks... but once was plenty.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.060
- Get to it.
- Right.

47:38.160 --> 47:41.900
You know, Howard,
we could hold out for a PBS special.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.180
Phil!

47:43.280 --> 47:46.500
Bev, get dressed.
Aren't you gonna see me off?

47:46.600 --> 47:50.500
Sure I am. I just hope
they let you take a carry-on bag.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.940
Look, I'm gonna put on these Polaroids
that we took at the Club.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.900
Thanks. These'll help...

47:57.000 --> 48:00.209
or the guys back home
are never gonna believe me.

48:01.320 --> 48:05.120
- What's this in my bag?
- Souvenirs...

48:06.920 --> 48:11.020
- I'm gonna miss you a lot, ducky.
- Bev...

48:11.120 --> 48:14.203
I don't belong here.
You know I've gotta go.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.484
Yeah.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.820
Lily had the dolphins.
Cousteau, the whales.

48:32.920 --> 48:36.970
Goudall the gorillas. I had a duck.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.011
I could have been a contender.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.940
Bev? I'm not a real sentimental guy.

48:49.040 --> 48:53.580
No, I bet you were born from
a very hard-boiled egg, ducky.

48:53.680 --> 48:58.420
Yeah. But, I do keep wondering...

48:58.520 --> 49:02.660
Of all the alleys in the world
I could have fallen into that night...

49:02.760 --> 49:05.580
Why did it have to be yours?

49:05.680 --> 49:07.762
Because, right now...

49:07.880 --> 49:13.011
you're the one and only thing
that's making it very hard for me to leave.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.820
- There's no guard.
- We should go back then, huh?

49:29.920 --> 49:30.700
Phil!

49:30.800 --> 49:32.723
- What?
- Drive.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.860
What are these alarms?

49:51.960 --> 49:53.380
- Something's happened.
- What's happened?

49:53.480 --> 49:54.641
I don't know.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.860
- That is really cool.
- Right. Hold it!

49:57.960 --> 49:59.530
Security!

50:01.440 --> 50:04.500
My eyes! My eyes!

50:04.600 --> 50:06.980
It exploded again! It was terrible!

50:07.080 --> 50:10.448
We have no right to tamper
with the universe.

50:13.480 --> 50:16.245
This does not hold well.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.289
Is he okay?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.420
- Get out of the way!
- It's still hot!

50:30.520 --> 50:33.922
Get them out of here!
Head for the emergency exits!

50:49.920 --> 50:51.740
Howard, where are you going?

50:51.840 --> 50:55.300
- Larry, where's Dr. Jenning?
- Carter, come here. Let me show you this.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.860
He was pre-activating
the laser spectra-scope.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.500
We lost control again
and there was another explosion.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.860
And, Jenning caught
the full force of the blast this time.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.580
Is he alright? Where is he?

51:04.680 --> 51:07.380
You see the bottom of the spectra scope
blew it to the wall...

51:07.480 --> 51:11.140
- and Jenning just... just disappeared.
- Excuse me.

51:11.240 --> 51:14.220
But is this gonna delay my take-off?

51:14.320 --> 51:18.609
Is that... is that it?
That's unbelievable!

51:18.720 --> 51:22.220
Yeah. We brought Howard down
the first time, but what if...

51:22.320 --> 51:26.564
My God, Larry, what if we brought down
something else this time?

51:28.840 --> 51:30.780
We're rounding up all the scientists
for you in the lab, sir...

51:30.880 --> 51:34.100
but I think you better take a look
at this other... this other thing first.

51:34.200 --> 51:36.820
A thing... Hansen?

51:36.920 --> 51:41.700
Is that kind of precise, descriptive techniques
they're teaching Rookies nowadays? A thing?

51:41.800 --> 51:44.460
I wanna know what
they're doing with Howard...

51:44.560 --> 51:47.340
- Excuse me, are you in charge here?
- Yeah. Why?

51:47.440 --> 51:49.700
Well, I wanna know
why they're harassing Howard.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.780
Who's Howard?

51:50.880 --> 51:54.300
He had nothing to do with it.
Howard, Howard is just an innocent...

51:54.400 --> 51:57.165
- thing?
- No, duck!

51:57.880 --> 52:00.060
Just an innocent duck?

52:00.160 --> 52:01.980
They wonder why I'm asking
for an early retirement.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.820
- You deal with this.
- Wait a second, you can't...

52:04.920 --> 52:08.140
Kirby, you got a "thing" in here, huh?

52:08.240 --> 52:09.207
Thing.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.128
I've had enough! I wanna see my lawyer.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.500
I've got rights, you know? I'm suing.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.284
Yeah.

52:21.560 --> 52:24.300
Goddamnit, Hansen, get in here
and get this friggen duck suit off this nut!

52:24.400 --> 52:25.208
Sir!

52:26.920 --> 52:30.340
- Alright, get him!
- Hey, hey, let me go! You big oafs!

52:30.440 --> 52:33.220
On my planet we never say die, we say...

52:33.320 --> 52:35.971
- Not my shorts!
- Why not?

52:36.840 --> 52:39.060
You perverts!

52:39.160 --> 52:41.740
- Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant, there's no zipper.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.780
There's no buttons. No velcro, sir.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.660
I think the suspect's stuff
is like inboard, sir.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.660
- Yeah. I think he's for real.
- If your goons are finished!

52:50.760 --> 52:52.285
Let go on me!

52:53.360 --> 52:56.940
I'd like a word with those
so-called scientists out there!

52:57.040 --> 52:59.980
- Oh, yeah? What about?
- About when they can rev up that machine...

53:00.080 --> 53:02.340
- and send me back home.
- Listen, Howard...

53:02.440 --> 53:04.540
I'm gonna go talk to
the scientists out there.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.860
You are gonna go play
sitting duck in a jail cell.

53:06.960 --> 53:10.931
- Lieutenant, what's the charge, sir?
- Illegal alien.

53:11.760 --> 53:12.886
Come on.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.700
- I'll get the car.
- Alright.

53:14.800 --> 53:18.180
- Oh, a cigar!
- Alright, that's how it starts.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.860
Police brutality!

53:19.960 --> 53:24.100
- Hey, stop manhandling him!
- Hey, you can't come in here.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.900
Here's another one already lift.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.780
- Oh, nuts, I dropped my cigar.
- What?

53:27.880 --> 53:28.700
Fire!

53:28.800 --> 53:30.180
- Fire...
- Oh, geez, that's all I need.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.203
So long, copper!

53:34.960 --> 53:37.804
Desperate ducks commit desperate acts!

53:39.240 --> 53:40.730
Freeze!

53:42.560 --> 53:43.940
Book him, ducko!

53:44.040 --> 53:46.361
Give her the keys to the cuffs, flatfoot!

53:48.560 --> 53:50.005
Yeah.

53:51.480 --> 53:53.220
What are you doing here tonight?
You got no ID.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.420
- Lieutenant?
- What?

53:54.520 --> 53:56.020
The duck got away.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.940
Shut up, fool! Get him out of here!

53:58.040 --> 54:01.580
Over here on the double.
Okay. I want this guy.

54:01.680 --> 54:04.260
The suspect is three foot one inches tall.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.940
- Three-two, thank you.
- You heard me.

54:07.040 --> 54:11.420
He's armed.
That means he's got a weapon, right?

54:11.520 --> 54:15.300
- That also means he's dangerous.
- Moi?

54:15.400 --> 54:18.131
Extremely dangerous.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.481
Shoot to kill!

54:23.040 --> 54:25.646
Let's move it out! Come on!

54:26.280 --> 54:28.362
Richard, come with me.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.410
Okay...

54:32.200 --> 54:33.884
Let's go.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.540
- No, don't shoot.
- We give up!

54:41.640 --> 54:44.120
- Time out!
- We surrender.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.811
- Dr. Jenning?
- What?

54:51.880 --> 54:54.451
- More cops. Come on, hurry!
- What?

54:54.560 --> 54:55.820
- Come here.
- Get over here, Doc.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.526
- Howard, Howard...
- What?

55:01.880 --> 55:03.780
The laser spectra-scope
malfunctioned again.

55:03.880 --> 55:07.820
There was a tremendous
explosion and then...

55:07.920 --> 55:11.970
I must have blacked out.
Then suddenly I find myself out here.

55:15.800 --> 55:19.220
- Are they after you?
- Does "shoot to kill" sound serious?

55:19.320 --> 55:21.322
I'm probably finished, too.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.660
Those experiments were unauthorized.

55:24.760 --> 55:27.240
They're probably gonna blame me.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.180
Oh, my God, he needs help.

55:31.280 --> 55:35.001
- Maybe we all should get out of here.
- You got a car, doc?

55:39.120 --> 55:42.060
What's wrong with me?
There's the back gate.

55:42.160 --> 55:46.245
- Good, there's no cops.
- I don't have a gate key.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.170
You've got a foot, don't you?
So step on it.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.180
Lieutenant, a car crashed out
the back gate.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.020
- Headed towards Highway 5.
- Alright, get out an all points.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.248
- Bulletin right now.
- Yes, sir!

56:02.840 --> 56:06.860
How the hell am I gonna explain
a manhunt for a duck?

56:06.960 --> 56:11.727
- It's a duck hunt.
- Hansen, please, don't start. Please?

56:12.880 --> 56:15.740
Can't you understand?
I'm telling you I saw something!

56:15.840 --> 56:17.900
Doc, you're in shock from the explosion.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.243
- And you're imagining things.
- Watch where you're going, damn it!

56:29.320 --> 56:33.260
Listen, an evil has landed.
The world is in great danger.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.820
Yeah, it certainly is
when you're out on the highway.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.126
Look out!

56:42.880 --> 56:44.180
You're gonna get us killed.

56:44.280 --> 56:48.300
It feels like something inside me
gnawing at my guts!

56:48.400 --> 56:52.260
- What's wrong with me?
- Well, what did you have for lunch?

56:52.360 --> 56:55.523
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

57:05.840 --> 57:08.580
Come on, give us a break!
Don't close your eyes.

57:08.680 --> 57:09.820
The pain.

57:09.920 --> 57:12.420
It's like I'm transforming inside.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.220
I'm afraid I'm about to become
something else.

57:15.320 --> 57:18.700
- Oh, great, like a sex change or something.
- Something's growing inside me.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.740
It's replicating and superseding
all my internal organs!

57:21.840 --> 57:24.260
Well, we'll stop at a bathroom, huh?

57:24.360 --> 57:27.340
That monster's shape I saw.

57:27.440 --> 57:28.885
No!

57:30.600 --> 57:33.500
- Jenning!
- It's inside my body.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.020
This guy's delirious.
He's not making any sense.

57:36.120 --> 57:39.020
It's too late.
The end of the world is coming...

57:39.120 --> 57:41.900
and I will be the cause of it.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.925
Jenning, slow down!
Steer, you big yo-yo! Steer!

57:52.640 --> 57:56.929
Howard, step on the brake!
Step on the brake!

58:03.520 --> 58:06.410
Oh, no! White line, wrong way.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.290
- The brake! Push, Beverly, push!
- I'm trying!

58:36.080 --> 58:37.620
I'm dead.

58:37.720 --> 58:39.500
Yes, you are.

58:39.600 --> 58:42.620
- You think that's funny, Jenning?
- I'm not Jenning any more.

58:42.720 --> 58:48.500
The transformation is complete.
I am now someone else.

58:48.600 --> 58:50.980
Try telling that
to your insurance company.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.811
I think he needs come coffee. Come on.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.889
Oh, after you.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.128
- Hey!
- Sorry.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.449
This is why I hate the night shift.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.500
I'm sorry, we don't allow
pets on the premises.

59:27.600 --> 59:32.128
Hey, have a heart. Seeing eye duck.

59:33.520 --> 59:35.522
Touching, isn't he?

59:36.600 --> 59:39.260
Not so tight. What are you doing?
Falling in love?

59:39.360 --> 59:41.860
Yeah, sit down.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.980
I need a beer bad. Gotta find a waitress.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.491
Yeah.

59:46.280 --> 59:50.683
- Hey, honey! You!
- Yeah, I'm coming.

59:51.440 --> 59:54.500
- Here she comes.
- Wow!

59:54.600 --> 59:59.060
Your kid's costume is really radical.
I'll bet he's crazy about...

59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.050
- It...
- Yeah, I'm very attached to him.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.700
Your dad's sort of in his own space.
What do you think he'd like to eat?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.486
I no longer need human food.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.340
I know it's a drag...

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.420
but you're gonna have to order
some food if you wanna sit here, so...

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.000
how about the specials on the menu?

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.100
You are about to witness
the end of the old world...

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.980
and the birth of the new.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.260
Hey, is he like one of those
TV-Evangelists or something?

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.820
- Yeah...
- Or something.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.580
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- It's okay, Howard.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.160
Why don't we just have
three specials and three beers?

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.566
Right.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.891
- Poor girl.
- Listen... Dr. J.!

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.420
If you could tune back
into reality for a second.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.340
I don't understand anything
you're talking about.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.300
All I know is I need
that laser machine to get me home.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.180
Is it still working, Jenning? Jenning!

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.420
I told you, bird brain,
I am not Jenning any more!

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.940
I am now one of
the Dark Overlords of the universe.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.331
- Dark Overlord of the universe?
- That must be quite a responsibility.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.900
Tonight the laser beam
hit the Nexus of Sominus.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.620
What is that? A suburb of Cleveland?

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.700
It lies beyond the planets.
It is a region of demons...

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.140
to which we Dark Overlords
were exiled eons ago.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.060
- I hope you're getting all this.
- Howard, what I'm getting is...

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.340
that this man is very, very sick.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.300
Just as you were brought
down here accidentally.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.340
Tonight, the laser beam released me...

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:52.340
from that region of demons
and pulled me down into that lab.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.580
Small universe...

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.700
During the explosion
I entered Jenning's body.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.370
So...

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.780
I have disguised my true form...

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:13.525
which would be considered
hideous and revolting here.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.362
Lucky for the people eating.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.820
You ordered the specials, what's wrong?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:26.220
This will mean the extinction
of all existing life forms.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.020
- But you haven't even tasted it yet.
- What do you think?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.521
- I'm into cannibalism or something?
- Hey.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.980
Are we like all
in the same discussion here?

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.220
I'll give you a hint, doll.
What's white, ovoid...

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.660
- and always reminds me of my birthday?
- I don't know.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.660
The eggs! Get them out of here!

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.380
Gosh!

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.220
You know, hostility is like
psychic boomerang.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.340
I can't believe this planet!
Fried eggs. Yuck!

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.604
- Just bring the beer!
- Howard? Howard!

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.060
- What happened?
- How the hell did you do that?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.820
- My powers are growing.
- Watch out!

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.940
- It is time now.
- What's that?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.060
It is the code key.
It will activate the laser spectra scope...

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.300
when I use it tonight to bring down
the other Dark Overlords.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.131
- The others?
- Now he's got a whole gang.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.740
Well, screw them.
I got dibs on the laser first.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.889
Gimme that code key.
That's my ticket home!

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.441
- Look at his hand!
- It's nothing. Look at his face!

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.340
Yes. Soon the Dark Overlords
will engulf the Earth.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.500
- Nothing human will remain here.
- Nothing duck's remaining here either!

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.940
- Move, we're going!
- You will get the check?

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.820
- Hate to eat and run.
- Hello there.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.700
- Get out of the way.
- Hey, look the talking duck.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.980
- Bug off!
- Lord, what is that?

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.220
You jackass, he's a ventriloquist.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.740
This guy here is doing the talking
and this here's the dummy.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.060
Go ahead, say something, dummy!

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.020
You might not wanna hear
what I'll say, Bozo!

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.408
Did you make him say that, jerk-off?

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.100
Leave him alone!
He was just in an industrial accident.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.340
- So take a hike, Cowboy!
- You...

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.380
- You're a dead duck!
- Hey!

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.380
- What's this? The key to your duck-mobile?
- Gimme that or you're gonna be sorry.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.340
Better watch out,
he's a master of quack-foo!

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.805
I'll quack-foo him!

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.860
Come on, Bev, run!

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.485
All nice! Going up!

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:47.967
I'm sorry!

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.771
Howard! Howard!

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.482
This one's for you, cracker!

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.682
- Good shot! Good shot!
- Another hungry customer!

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.723
- You...
- Toro, toro! Olé!

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.365
I'm gonna get you, you dumb duck!

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.529
Hey, boy!

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.220
- Call the police!
- Not the police!

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.140
Call somebody else!
They're gonna hurt Howard.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.371
An evil unlike any you can imagine
is about to engulf the Earth.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.086
Oh, no, no, we have fights
in here all the time.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.380
- Your order is ready.
- Are you gonna just sit there?

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.484
- She took my eggs!
- One special!

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.849
- Howard!
- Beverly!

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.451
- Howard!
- Jenning!

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.529
- I could use some help here, buddy!
- Come on, let's get out of here!

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:51.967
Howard?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.260
You're not getting away now,
you stinking little bird!

01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:00.161
Hands off my feathers! Put me down!
Put me down right now!

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.820
Put him down!

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.740
Howard may be a duck
but you people are animals!

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.241
He's my boyfriend!

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.564
That's disgusting.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.660
You don't make me proud to be a human!

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.900
Let me just pay the check
and I'm out of here.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.820
- Freeze!
- I can't believe that you're just sitting here.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.604
Look what they're doing to Howard!

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.300
- Oh, geez!
- Chicken fry!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.300
Where's the SPCA when you need them?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.220
- I am not amused!
- I'm gonna barbecue your bill, bird.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.900
Oh, Great Duck in Heaven,
this is the end of Howard.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.651
There's gonna be more violence!
I hate violence!

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.500
You gotta go in there and beat them up.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.340
Jenning! Jenning, don't just sit there!
This is serious!

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.140
- They're gonna cook me!
- Take that!

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.528
- Stuff him!
- Any last words?

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.980
Yeah, Jenning!

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.700
- He's my favorite duck.
- You hardly know him.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.740
Jenning! They're seasoning me!
Wait, you better let me up.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.260
- You don't wanna get my friend angry!
- Oh, yeah? Why?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.100
Because he's one of the
Dark Overlords of the universe.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.044
And he can destroy you
and the Earth, everything.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.686
Yeah, well, I didn't buy it
at first either.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.850
Look, they're laughing at you
and they've got Mr. Code Key.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.169
Oh, my God!

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.620
- One, two...
- Wait a minute! Jenning!

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.530
Look! I warned you! Here he comes!

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.609
- He must have ate the chili.
- Release the small water fowl!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.740
- Bring me the code key, Howard.
- Right! The code key!

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.260
You heard him! Cut me loose!

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.046
Sounds like a brunch of bull-puckie to me!

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.521
Oh, my God!

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.729
Oh, my God!

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:35.939
- Are you okay, Howard?
- Yes.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.645
- Enough of this crap!
- You, out of here!

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:45.411
If you can't take the heat,
get out of that kitchen!

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.399
- Where's the code key?
- It's closing time!

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.841
- The code key!
- It's not nice to fool with the Dark Overlord.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.725
- They get the point, Jenning!
- Get out of the way!

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.562
- Now's our chance.
- Yeah, come on. This way.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.609
Cut it out, Howard.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.246
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, without you!

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.840
- Move the table out of the way!
- I can't, it's stuck!

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.689
What's wrong?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.700
Howard, get down from there!

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.247
- Like I'm doing this on purpose?
- Give me the code key!

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.488
Yeah? What if I don't?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.283
Can't you take a joke?
Geez, you broke my head.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.020
I will now bring down
the other Dark Overlords.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.645
Hey, what about me?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.047
You filthy scum bucket!

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.402
Run!

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.642
No! Beverly!

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.051
Beverly?

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.083
Look out!

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.602
You killed him! You killed him!

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.562
Beverly, I'll find you!

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.900
- I need your body.
- Creep, I've heard that one before!

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.420
The Dark Overlords
cannot exist on this planet...

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:17.768
- unless they grow inside a human body.
- God, no!

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.850
I hurt! Need energy.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.769
Watch out!

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.762
More energy!

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.721
That's the grossest! I'm gonna puke!

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.888
Oh, God!

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.900
There was this big guy
and this girl and this little kid.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.140
At least I thought it was a little kid.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.940
Then I flashed on reality, right! Bam!
Halloween's not till next month.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.180
I know my rights. Where's my baseball cap?

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.601
- Shut up!
- Bastards!

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.924
No handle...

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.089
Philsey!

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.404
Philsey!

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.966
Philsey! It's me.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.643
Howard.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.300
Howard, I got arrested at the plant.
I'm gonna have a criminal record.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.660
Jenning kidnapped Beverly.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.060
He's taking her back to that science lab.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.140
- What? Why?
- He's some kind of monster.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.608
He's gonna bring down more of his buddies.
He's got big plans.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.100
Like taking over Earth.
Philsey, we gotta get out of here.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.220
Howard, this door
doesn't have any handles...

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.540
Get a rock or something
and break this window.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.847
- Rock?
- Window.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.402
Let me try the door first.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.050
- How we getting out of here?
- Come on.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.642
Philsey, where we goin'?

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.089
Hey, over here.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.260
- It'll be dawn soon.
- Hey, let's steal a cop car.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.340
Don't you think that would be
a little conspicuous?

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.808
- Hitchhike? Cab?
- What is that?

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.620
Geez! It looks like an airplane.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.180
Well, it will be.
We can put it together in no time.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.460
Somebody's weekend hobby's
gonna get us back to that lab.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.820
Hey, we've got a saying on my planet.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.340
If God intended us to fly,
he wouldn't have taken away our wings.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.700
That's really profound, Howard.
Could you find the tool box?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.010
Yeah, I know why you want a tool box.
You got a screw loose.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.482
Power.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.611
Oh, no...

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.060
They just spotted the duck and the kid.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.020
- Where?
- Behind the warehouse next door.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.566
- They're about to take off.
- What do you mean, "take off"?

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.484
- It's not doing anything.
- Cops!

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.620
- Come on, push forward on the throttle!
- Okay, yeah.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.370
Full throttle! Full throttle!

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.300
- Cops, Philsey!
- 180, Howard.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.287
Right.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.180
One away!

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.580
Go! Go!

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.331
Come on! Hurry! Come on!

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.331
- There's cops everywhere!
- Not in the air, Howard! Up, up!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.760
Look out!

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.891
Prepare for a take-off.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.641
No, no!

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.729
Follow them!
Bring them down and bring them back!

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.300
I want that duck! Dead or alive!

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.722
- It's south-southwest, Howard!
- What?

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.247
That way. Stay low!

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.126
Beverly, I'm coming to get you,
sweetheart!

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.100
Help me! Help! Somebody help me!
Please, help me!

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.260
Please watch your step.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.860
I think you're all gonna find this
very interesting.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.980
You know, honestly, congressman...

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.020
this three-mile-island-China-syndrome-
meltdown-stuff, that's all history.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.842
The only melt downs around here are
the cheese sandwiches in the toaster oven.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:09.180
Whoa... These Washington guys
take a real beating on these junkets.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.540
Our nuclear reactor is pumping out
one million kilowatts of power.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.087
One million kilowatts...

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.845
- power!
- Yes, sir.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.100
Listen, I think we could all
use a cup of coffee.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.171
Help! Somebody help me, please! Help!

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.620
Let's go! Come on! Go, go!

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.131
Run! Run! Run!

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.771
I feel much better.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.160
- Now look at that!
- Right pedal! Right pedal!

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.780
- Damn it, that was too close!
- I'm just learning here!

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.260
Howard, in pre-historic times you flew.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.843
Fly, Howard! Find your instincts.
Trust your birdness. Fly!

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.921
Howard, pull up! Pull up!

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.700
- Touch down!
- Great landing, Howard...

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.780
but this isn't gonna get us to the lab.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:24.090
You said to follow my instincts.
This is my nesting instinct.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.648
Oh, no!

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.940
- I'm flying blind here.
- Shut up! You're not flying at all!

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.805
- Let her rip!
- Bombs away!

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.620
Pull it up, Howard,
were running outta land!

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.371
- Wet stuff ahead!
- Watch out!

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.771
Death from the sky to all duck hunters!

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.686
Tora, tora, tora!

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.500
Vengeance is mine! Yeah!

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.522
Howard!

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.005
Banzai!

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.020
Slow down. Slow down here.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.487
Hey! Hey, you, pull over here!

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.161
This is a smog device inspection.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.849
- And I need... Shut off the engine!
- It is off! Somebody's pushing!

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.327
Shut it down! Shut it down!
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.361
- I wanna see your license, Jack!
- I have no license, I am not Jack.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.721
Smog inspection!

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.925
What happened?

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.245
We gotta get outta here!

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.660
- Damage report, Philsey!
- Fuel hose is busted!

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.084
Rotor is wasted.
Basically, we're dying here, Howard.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.220
- I'm bailing out!
- No, you're not!

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.847
You're gonna get up there
and fix this lawn mower now!

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.726
- Philsey, how's it going?
- I'm getting close.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.161
- I'm on top of it!
- Good.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.323
Relax, Howard, I almost got it!

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.561
Philsey, I did a loop-the-loop.
I'm getting good at this! I'm...

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.930
Howard!

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.060
Up, Howard!

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.740
Up!

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.968
Geez, I thought I lost you.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.100
Philsey, this is no time for water sports.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.487
I'm just kidding, big guy.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.567
Please, scum, let me go!

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.620
- Philsey, get back up here!
- I'm trying!

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.060
No, no, don't shoot!
I'm an innocent hostage!

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.060
- The duck's a lunatic!
- What?

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.642
He's a duck terrorist!
He hijacked the plane!

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.803
Howard, pull it up!

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.561
- Welcome back, Philsey!
- Thanks, it's great to be back, Howard!

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.980
Will you watch the road, damn it?

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.163
Hey, another car. No big deal!

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.340
- Yes, big deal! Big...
- What?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.171
Big, big, big...

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.848
- No wings.
- Welcome to the club.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.171
Coming through!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.860
That was a lot of fun.
I'd like to get off now.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.769
Slow down.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.180
Slow down!

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.460
Relax, I'll just throttle this baby back.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.005
Yikes!

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.820
- Philsey! I better tell you now.
- What?

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.604
I can't swim!

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.220
Philsey, help! Philsey, help me!

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.500
Never heard of a duck that couldn't swim.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.500
Shut up and save me!

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.540
We've been through hell!

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.780
Now, if there's some kind of monster
in here... Howard this is crazy!

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.540
Phil, no duck is an island
and if fate sent me here to save Earth...

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.769
then Howard the Duck is ready to fight!

01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.646
Damn!

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.660
Yikes!

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.380
- He's starting the spectra scope.
- Geez...

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.881
He's gonna bring down
another Dark Overlord.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.340
- We gotta get Beverly outta there.
- Hey, take it easy, Conan.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.980
What are you gonna fight him with?
We gotta find some kind of... Wait!

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.130
Carter showed me something here once
that might do it, if we can find it!

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.928
You'll never get away with this!

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.243
We'll find it! Come on, Philsey!

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.250
You don't scare me!

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.281
Oh, boy, defense research!
This is it! This is it! This is locked!

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.900
Okay, I know where it is.
It's on the right or the left or the...

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.210
There it is. The neutron disintegrator.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.767
- And a big lock.
- Rats!

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.620
Okay, alright.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.770
Turn me into a Dark Overlord.
I'll still spit in your wormy face!

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.860
Welcome to Dyna-Technics.
Authorized personnel only.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:39.140
Please insert code key.
Authorized personnel only.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.260
Thank you. Hello Dr. Jenning.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.445
Please select your target
and enter target coordinates.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.500
Thank you. Laser spectra scope
is now targeting the Nexus of Sominus.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.682
Targeting is in process.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.340
Come on, Philsey! Hit it harder!

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.090
Way to go!

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.420
- Hurry up!
- The neutron disintegrator...

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.740
was developed for the Army
until he cost overance...

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.940
- became really embarrassing...
- Can it stop Jenning?

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.725
Theoretically yes.
Unfortunately it's never been tested.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.380
Attention, all personnel,
please leave the station...

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.528
while laser doors are opening.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.969
Please, initiate spectra scope extension.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.284
Target is now locked.
Target is now locked.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.980
Is this like stick-shift or automatic?

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.260
Howard, you have to get
into firing range without him seeing you!

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.940
Right. I'll sneak up on him
and then I'll blast him!

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.740
Do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.922
Dr. Jenning, I repeat:

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.362
Do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.730
Thank you.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.682
- What's this do?
- No, Howard, that's the accelerator!

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.086
Howard!

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:24.283
- You're in big trouble now!
- Shut up!

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.322
Run, Howard! He's in a bad mood!

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.287
Come on, Philsey, move!
Let's crank her up!

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.764
- Hurry!
- Where's that button?

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.405
It won't start!

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.020
- Watch out!
- Jump, Howard!

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.860
- This is our only chance!
- Get outta there.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.725
- Duck!
- And proud of it!

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:41.100
Philsey, you saved my life!

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.780
Are you all right?

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.860
- Terrific, Howard.
- It still won't start!

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.442
- Try the seat belt, Howard.
- Seat belt?

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.721
Watsabe misua!

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.840
You little pond hopper.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.801
Go, Howard, go!

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.287
Talk about bad breath!

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.164
Turn it! Charge!

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.564
Now it's my turn.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.526
Dark Overlord, I want you!

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.602
Prepare to eat beak!

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.208
So long, sucker!

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.366
Howard!

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.965
No!

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.925
Howard?

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.047
Howard?

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.010
- Oh, boy!
- Howard?

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.449
- Howard!
- You're alright?

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.460
I need this like I need another tail!

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.086
- You did it!
- Hey! Get me down from here!

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.850
Come on!

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.844
- Dr. Jenning?
- Howard, it's not...

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.500
- It's not what?
- The evil's not inside me any more.

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.780
The explosion must have released it
and it's loose!

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.340
- What about me?
- The Dark Overlord is still here.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.889
Well, then I suggest we get Beverly
and get the hell outta here!

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.731
Philsey, get her down from there!

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.580
- What took you so long?
- Nothing. Just got arrested...

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.571
shot at, handcuffed...
I got thrown out of an airplane!

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.340
- Guys?
- He stuck his tongue in a cigarette lighter!

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.980
Cigarette lighter?
That's really disgusting!

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.491
- Guys?
- What?

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.925
Oh, my God!

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.220
Phil, Phil. Get up! Get up!

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.540
- It's coming!
- It's coming! I was just resting.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:14.402
Look!

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.811
There will be no escape!

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.563
Good boy, stay back! Stay back. Oh, boy!

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.651
Howard!

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.620
There goes Howard!
We've gotta help Howard, Phill!

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.121
- What? Yeah, gotta help Howard!
- We gotta help!

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.607
- Come on. Howard!
- Here we go!

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.051
Going somewhere, Howard?

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:14.728
- There's no escape.
- Philsey! Dr. Jenning! Mother!

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.340
- Do you wish to active the laser?
- Yes.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.660
Thank you, Dr. Jenning.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.740
- He started the activation sequence.
- He's gonna bring down more of them.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.161
You may fire when ready.

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.969
Four minutes to arrival.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.620
Philsey, Beverly, anybody! Help!

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.780
Three minutes, thirty seconds to arrival.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.848
Howard! Here!

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.685
Alright!

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.288
Slice salami!

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.845
Yuck!

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.288
Did you lose something?

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.520
Alien specimens are arriving
in laboratory in three minutes.

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.042
Alright!

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.620
Eat claw, duck!

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:05.524
- Two minutes to arrival.
- Belt, butt, trigger!

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.860
One minute, thirty seconds to arrival.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.851
Puny little duck!

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.286
Yeah!

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.249
One minute to arrival.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.847
Howard!

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.521
There's more coming down.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.700
The machine, Howard.
You've got to destroy it! Blast it!

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.060
Get them!

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.924
No, Howard, don't!

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.820
- You'll never get home.
- Thirty seconds to arrival.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.921
Get them!

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.740
Goodbye, Duck World. Get outta there. Run!

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.860
- Come on!
- Ten seconds and counting to arrival.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.340
- Over here!
- Ten, nine, eight...

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.340
seven, six, five, four...

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.380
three, two, one...

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.527
arrival.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.124
Howard!

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.089
Oh, no...

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.290
I don't know where you are now...

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:44.131
but I hope you're happier there.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.923
This world didn't treat you very good...

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.486
but you saved it, didn't you?

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.405
Howard?

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.889
I am not Howard anymore.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:25.681
Geez! All this smoke,
it's murder on the sinuses.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.129
Fooled you, didn't I?

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:37.085
- Howard...
- It's alright, toots.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:54.441
Well, alright, I'd like to dedicate
this song to our new manager!

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.208
Go!

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.620
Alright, get the mechanical.
We're gonna release the big wave-0.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.610
Cue and ready. Cue and go!

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.700
- Howard, Howard. Help me out!
- Yeah?

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.451
- Release that rope there!
- Gotcha!

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:55.580
- Not that one!
- Philsey, what's going on?

01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.163
Get me down from here!
I've done enough flying. Philsey!

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.805
Philsey!

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.845
Philsey, do you realize
I could have been killed up there?

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.980
- What's this?
- Rock 'n' Roll!

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.260
Right!

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.010
Give me four!

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.130
Yeah!

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.288
Big, big, baby.

01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.566
Is that hot enough for you?

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.045
Hit a purple "A" for you all.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.490
Do it!

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.729
That's me!

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:49.660
Thank you! Thank you! We love ya!

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.129
- Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard!
- Thank you!

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.049
We love you!

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.740
Not bad for a duck from outer space.

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:05.127
You were great, ducky.
