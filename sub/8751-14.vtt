WEBVTT

00:05.586 --> 00:08.574
There are a lot of dead
people in this house.

00:08.575 --> 00:09.991
There was five of us who seen it.

00:09.992 --> 00:12.695
When women are here, it
seems like it's angry.

00:12.696 --> 00:15.512
He's trying to interact with them now.

00:15.513 --> 00:17.697
He glared like he wanted to kill me.

00:17.698 --> 00:20.441
There's a dead person that was,
like, crawling up the stairs.

00:20.442 --> 00:22.925
To me, it looked like what
a Reaper may look like.

00:22.926 --> 00:24.739
Do you think whatever's
here is dangerous?

00:24.740 --> 00:25.996
Yes.

00:25.997 --> 00:27.866
It wants to hurt people.

00:27.867 --> 00:30.327
She's dying.

00:32.889 --> 00:34.905
There's something down there.

00:34.906 --> 00:38.026
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.676 --> 00:40.977
A lot of dead people are here.

00:40.978 --> 00:42.145
I see dead people.

00:42.146 --> 00:43.780
This is not good.

00:43.781 --> 00:45.949
I speak to dead people..

00:45.950 --> 00:47.751
He is very pissed off.

00:47.752 --> 00:48.985
And they speak to me..

00:48.986 --> 00:50.554
The house is angry.

00:50.555 --> 00:54.136
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.959
He's killed people.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.126
I rely on my partner.

00:57.127 --> 00:58.562
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

00:58.563 --> 01:00.630
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:00.631 --> 01:02.198
He got shot at his house?

01:02.199 --> 01:05.319
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.670
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:06.671 --> 01:08.071
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.072 --> 01:10.039
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist".

01:10.040 --> 01:12.175
But Steve and I never speak..

01:12.176 --> 01:14.110
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:14.111 --> 01:15.445
Until the very end..

01:15.446 --> 01:16.813
It's bad.

01:16.814 --> 01:18.815
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:18.816 --> 01:20.249
I'd like some answers.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.250
Or time to get out.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:45.739 --> 01:48.467
No matter how far we travel
to investigate a case,

01:48.468 --> 01:51.518
Amy and I gather our
findings separately.

01:51.519 --> 01:55.522
I uncover the property's
history, exposing its past.

02:11.471 --> 02:14.051
Population 101.

02:17.033 --> 02:19.387
I'm on my way to meet
a woman named Dawn.

02:19.388 --> 02:23.502
A few years ago, her Father took a
job as a caretaker at an old hotel

02:23.503 --> 02:26.172
in the middle of nowhere.

02:26.173 --> 02:28.574
Now she says some crazy
things are going on there

02:28.575 --> 02:30.691
and that the hotel
itself seems to lash out

02:30.692 --> 02:33.512
at the people that stay
there, except her Father.

02:33.513 --> 02:39.413
But he refuses to leave, and she
thinks he's in serious danger.

02:51.063 --> 02:53.257
Before Amy enters a
location, I have to clear it

02:53.258 --> 02:58.238
of everything which could
influence her findings.

02:58.971 --> 03:02.274
This hotel is very large, so
it's important I take my time

03:02.275 --> 03:06.895
to cover or remove all
leading information.

03:27.533 --> 03:32.104
As I approach this location, I can
already hear dead people speaking to me.

03:32.105 --> 03:38.005
They're warning me about someone very
dangerous who wanders these grounds.

03:44.216 --> 03:47.696
There's a very large man..

03:47.942 --> 03:51.090
That hangs around here.

03:51.091 --> 03:54.125
He's, like, 7 feet tall.

03:54.126 --> 03:58.026
I don't think anybody likes him.

04:00.766 --> 04:05.271
There are all these women
kneeling on the ground.

04:05.272 --> 04:07.077
Really creepy.

04:07.078 --> 04:12.418
And they were crying and
crying and begging, begging.

04:27.426 --> 04:29.462
So, Dawn, what's going
on in the resort here?

04:29.463 --> 04:32.197
My Father is the caretaker of it.

04:32.198 --> 04:36.102
And I'm concerned about his safety, being
way out here in the middle of Alaska.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.062
Why?

04:37.063 --> 04:39.472
We are having some
really weird stuff happen.

04:39.473 --> 04:41.307
Okay, now what, you
were just visiting him?

04:41.308 --> 04:43.302
Yes. I actually live in Indiana.

04:43.303 --> 04:45.498
Okay. So what were some of
the things that happened?

04:45.499 --> 04:49.290
Two years ago, we came to visit my
Father, and he put us up in here.

04:49.291 --> 04:53.418
We have rugs that flip over, and
I've seen doors open and close,

04:53.419 --> 04:55.354
footsteps coming up the stairs.

04:55.355 --> 04:57.365
What about the rugs?
I've never heard that.

04:57.366 --> 05:00.864
Well, what happened is, we'd leave
the hotel, and when we would come back,

05:00.865 --> 05:03.461
the rugs would just be standing
on end up against the door.

05:03.462 --> 05:05.734
So nobody came in, messed
around, and then walked out?

05:05.735 --> 05:08.479
And there's.. No one
else had access to it.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.120
That's bizarre.

05:21.991 --> 05:24.201
This tall guy..

05:24.202 --> 05:29.366
He knows how to move things
and make things shake,

05:29.367 --> 05:33.267
make noises and things like that.

05:33.393 --> 05:34.881
I don't like this.

05:34.882 --> 05:38.962
It makes me, uh, very uncomfortable.

05:42.289 --> 05:44.426
He wants me to stay

05:44.427 --> 05:46.874
away from here.

05:46.875 --> 05:50.715
He doesn't want me around here.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.006
So, Dawn, what happened here?

05:59.007 --> 06:00.677
My sister and I were
down in the other room,

06:00.678 --> 06:03.019
watching TV, and we heard a door open.

06:03.020 --> 06:06.310
So we came up here, closed
the door, went and sat down.

06:06.311 --> 06:08.447
No sooner sat down,
we heard it open again.

06:08.448 --> 06:09.815
Now did you actually see it open?

06:09.816 --> 06:11.786
Yes. The second time, we seen it open.

06:11.787 --> 06:12.745
Wow.

06:12.746 --> 06:16.133
Well, I have something
else that is really crazy.

06:16.134 --> 06:20.213
We had also seen a 3-headed apparition.

06:20.214 --> 06:24.406
There was five of us who seen it, and
all five of us seen something different.

06:24.407 --> 06:25.911
A 3-headed what?

06:25.912 --> 06:27.322
It just had.. It had three heads.

06:27.323 --> 06:29.957
It looked like, um, Indian feathers.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.820
Some people seen a monkey face on it.

06:31.821 --> 06:34.756
To me, it looked like what
a Reaper may look like.

06:34.757 --> 06:35.623
That's bizarre.

06:35.624 --> 06:37.124
It was just looking at us.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.328
- Did you stay here that night?
- I did.

06:39.329 --> 06:42.569
That took a lotta guts.

06:47.236 --> 06:50.296
He might harm people.

06:52.414 --> 06:56.718
He shows himself to me like he's, like..

06:56.719 --> 07:01.039
Really tall, and he has this huge axe.

07:05.887 --> 07:08.297
I feel uncomfortable.

07:08.298 --> 07:09.453
Why?

07:09.454 --> 07:12.814
I don't like that stuff.

07:21.637 --> 07:24.622
Steve, this is the library here.

07:24.623 --> 07:27.090
Okay, so, uh, what happened up here?

07:27.091 --> 07:29.601
This was a mess, so we were
straightening the books, and we

07:29.602 --> 07:35.502
turned and there was an apparition
standing over by door three.

07:37.668 --> 07:40.803
To me, it reminded me
of a Grandmother figure.

07:40.804 --> 07:42.668
At first, we couldn't
even believe our eyes.

07:42.669 --> 07:44.296
We were trying to decide, should we run?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.210
Are we seeing what
we think we're seeing?

07:46.211 --> 07:50.891
And then when we looked
back, it was gone.

07:51.582 --> 07:52.780
And what did she look like?

07:52.781 --> 07:55.052
She had on a dress
with a sweater over it.

07:55.053 --> 07:58.155
This is also where you would
hear the footsteps coming up.

07:58.156 --> 07:59.562
I mean, how's that make
you feel, knowing your..

07:59.563 --> 08:01.635
Your Father, who's elderly, being here?

08:01.636 --> 08:05.296
I'm concerned for his safety.

08:10.401 --> 08:14.296
There's a woman and a kid crying.

08:14.297 --> 08:16.937
Crying up here.

08:25.303 --> 08:28.124
They're crying and crying and crying.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.791
She reminds me of, like, this..

08:30.792 --> 08:33.611
German Grandmother.

08:34.725 --> 08:38.011
I think the Father wasn't good to them,

08:38.013 --> 08:41.373
and would lock them away.

08:47.571 --> 08:50.940
So, Heather, I understand, uh, that
you actually worked here at some point.

08:50.941 --> 08:53.857
Yeah, I worker here in
1989 for about 4 months.

08:53.858 --> 08:55.663
Did you ever experience anything?

08:55.664 --> 09:00.330
I was standing out by the pool, and I
looked up at the fourth floor window,

09:00.331 --> 09:03.766
and I saw a full figure,
and it looked like a woman.

09:03.767 --> 09:07.812
And then when I looked up, it was gone.

09:07.813 --> 09:08.771
Anything else?

09:08.772 --> 09:14.239
I just finished cleaning this room, and
I set the furniture polish on the chair

09:14.240 --> 09:18.092
and then I realized I'd forgot my rag,
and as soon as I went to turn back around,

09:18.093 --> 09:21.801
it flew off the chair and
went past me and hit the wall.

09:21.802 --> 09:24.118
Oh, so it didn't just fall
off the chair? It went flying.

09:24.119 --> 09:26.279
It flew.

09:26.309 --> 09:28.235
You think whatever's here is dangerous?

09:28.236 --> 09:29.506
Yes.

09:29.507 --> 09:31.792
Your Father's here.
Are you afraid for him?

09:31.793 --> 09:35.240
I do worry about him because
it's kind of a violent action,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.964
that something would
fly at you like that.

09:36.965 --> 09:41.525
So I've worried about
him numerous times.

09:45.306 --> 09:46.618
Ugh.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.139
What's wrong?

09:53.484 --> 09:56.724
Just this big guy here.

09:57.318 --> 09:59.565
This big guy is in here.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.081
And he likes to..

10:02.082 --> 10:04.842
Freak people out.

10:04.907 --> 10:05.974
What does he do?

10:05.975 --> 10:07.798
He can throw things at people.

10:07.799 --> 10:11.722
He could throw something and hurt me.

10:11.723 --> 10:14.816
I see him angry and doing it.

10:14.817 --> 10:16.685
Throwing things about.

10:16.686 --> 10:20.289
And then I see him stumbling and drunk.

10:20.290 --> 10:24.490
He likes to bother the ladies mostly.

10:24.794 --> 10:26.395
- As far as living people?
- Yeah.

10:26.396 --> 10:27.154
Okay.

10:27.155 --> 10:30.155
Uh, because he, um..

10:30.220 --> 10:34.660
Thinks they're stupid and he hates them.

10:42.398 --> 10:45.561
Just this big guy here.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.569
Really doesn't like women.

10:47.570 --> 10:51.050
He hates them.. Hates them.

10:52.352 --> 10:57.512
He hates them, hates them,
hates them, hates them.

10:59.358 --> 11:02.930
He's trying to interact with them now.

11:02.931 --> 11:06.166
He wants to hurt people.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.401
He does like to move beds.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.806
Well, what he can do is, can make it..

11:11.807 --> 11:14.987
Evenly go up and down.

11:15.298 --> 11:18.858
Up, off the ground, and down again.

11:18.859 --> 11:21.679
I don't like it.

11:35.496 --> 11:39.724
Now your daughter seems a little
concerned about your safety.

11:39.725 --> 11:41.007
Yeah, I know they're.. They're always

11:41.008 --> 11:42.636
worried about what's
happening to me in here.

11:42.637 --> 11:45.873
The way I look at it is, it's strange
when a daughter worries about their Father.

11:45.874 --> 11:48.375
I mean, I should be worried
about my.. My children. But, uh..

11:48.376 --> 11:50.343
Anything that you can tell me about?

11:50.344 --> 11:54.521
I.. I've seen the doors
slide open and slam shut.

11:54.522 --> 11:56.492
When they close, they
just don't close, Steve.

11:56.493 --> 11:59.433
I mean.. They slam.

12:01.824 --> 12:03.426
So, Bill, have you seen anything else?

12:03.427 --> 12:05.238
I hear footsteps all the time.

12:05.239 --> 12:09.242
Up and down the steps. I hear it from
the basement up here, too, at times.

12:09.243 --> 12:11.377
Your daughter, she mentioned..

12:11.378 --> 12:13.427
Some bizarre thing
with three heads on it.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.307
- Yeah. Right.
- She said you saw it also.

12:15.308 --> 12:17.588
I saw it.

12:17.931 --> 12:19.341
Can you describe it?

12:19.342 --> 12:21.348
It was almost 7 and a half feet high,

12:21.349 --> 12:22.762
because that's probably
what that ceiling is.

12:22.763 --> 12:23.745
Okay.

12:23.746 --> 12:27.940
And one head was
stacked on another head.

12:27.941 --> 12:31.425
And then right here, there
was, like, a monkey there

12:31.426 --> 12:33.918
but it was just the monkey's head.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.682
It had arms, but it had feathers.

12:37.683 --> 12:40.279
So how do you feel
about whatever's here?

12:40.280 --> 12:41.929
Whatever it is don't like women.

12:41.930 --> 12:47.090
When women are here, it
seems like it's angriest.

12:57.426 --> 12:58.988
You all right?

12:58.989 --> 13:02.109
- No.
- What's wrong?

13:02.150 --> 13:04.070
What?

13:14.246 --> 13:16.229
What's wrong?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.479
I don't know. Like,
there was a dead person

13:18.480 --> 13:24.249
that was, like, crawling up the stairs
towards me, and it kinda creeped me out.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.087
Someone does not want me
to go into the basement

13:27.088 --> 13:31.948
and is trying to scare
me out of this place.

13:32.508 --> 13:38.268
There's, like, something kind
of standing guard down there.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.372
So, Bill, why'd you bring me down here?

13:45.373 --> 13:48.454
Well, I guess, uh, I feel that..

13:48.455 --> 13:50.518
That the apparition or
whatever it is is kind of..

13:50.519 --> 13:52.808
Is always assisting me
whenever I have projects.

13:52.809 --> 13:55.304
If I can't find the part..

13:55.305 --> 13:57.911
I'll be looking for it and looking
for it, and then I'll just..

13:57.912 --> 14:01.621
Out of nowhere, it'll appear
like on the shelf here.

14:01.622 --> 14:03.646
Where you've looked already
once today and didn't find it.

14:03.647 --> 14:06.993
And so well.. When I come back, well
I'll go to another shop and look around,

14:06.994 --> 14:09.061
and it'll appear where I
was working on something.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.642
It's happened numerous times to me.

14:10.643 --> 14:15.023
So it's.. It's just, uh, it helps me.

14:25.545 --> 14:31.049
Oh, the guy with the.. The
axe does come.. He's down here.

14:31.050 --> 14:35.070
He doesn't like people
to come down here.

14:35.071 --> 14:36.654
Why?

14:36.655 --> 14:38.515
Mm..

14:44.500 --> 14:47.031
He feels like..

14:47.032 --> 14:50.092
He's protecting stuff.

14:53.104 --> 14:54.472
Let me ask you a question.

14:54.473 --> 14:58.081
Bill, your daughter seems concerned about
you, but you don't seem too concerned.

14:58.082 --> 15:00.606
It seems like my daughters
are always worried about me,

15:00.607 --> 15:02.641
but then again, I
figure if it was doing..

15:02.642 --> 15:05.193
If it was a bad.. Bad thing,
I.. It wouldn't be helping me.

15:05.194 --> 15:07.929
You know, it helps me out
and then scares the girls.

15:07.930 --> 15:10.763
So, I mean, I don't know, Steve.

15:10.764 --> 15:14.057
You gotta be prepared for Amy to say..

15:14.058 --> 15:16.642
"You know, you've got some issues here.
You really shouldn't be working here".

15:16.643 --> 15:18.607
If I find out, yeah, this
place is full of demons,

15:18.608 --> 15:23.588
I don't think you'd be
seeing me around here.

15:26.315 --> 15:29.435
Mm, there's screaming.

15:29.757 --> 15:33.866
It's a lot like really rough screaming.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.217
Like a.. Howl.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.751
Like howling.

15:37.752 --> 15:42.443
Yeah, man, I'm getting
(Bleep) Weird (Bleep).

15:42.444 --> 15:47.364
There are a lot of dead
people in this house.

15:55.936 --> 15:58.156
So, Colette, I talked to,
uh, your stepdaughter Dawn.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.089
And, uh, your husband Bill.

16:00.090 --> 16:03.426
And they said some pretty
wild things are going on here.

16:03.427 --> 16:05.278
Are you concerned for anybody's..

16:05.279 --> 16:06.422
I don't know, safety?

16:06.423 --> 16:08.882
Yes, I do fear for their safety.

16:08.883 --> 16:10.245
What makes you say that?

16:10.246 --> 16:15.332
I was in here washing the floor,
and a bowl flew right off this..

16:15.333 --> 16:19.473
Off the shelf right in front of me.

16:19.501 --> 16:23.179
When the bowl came off the
shelf, how far did it go?

16:23.180 --> 16:25.048
I'd say about three feet.

16:25.049 --> 16:28.173
So three feet.. That means
it didn't fall off the shelf.

16:28.174 --> 16:30.470
No, it flew off the shelf.

16:30.471 --> 16:31.587
Okay.

16:31.588 --> 16:34.002
You know, I was talking
to Dawn and Bill, and..

16:34.003 --> 16:37.868
They told me a pretty bizarre
sighting that they had of this..

16:37.869 --> 16:40.813
Thing with three heads. Uh..

16:40.814 --> 16:42.830
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

16:42.831 --> 16:44.865
Okay. Describe it to me.

16:44.866 --> 16:47.179
It had large feathers.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.391
- Okay.
- There were three heads on it..

16:49.392 --> 16:51.631
Two male heads, and a third..

16:51.632 --> 16:55.652
Head was half monkey and half man.

16:55.677 --> 16:59.877
He glared like he wanted to kill me.

17:00.815 --> 17:03.052
This tall guy..

17:03.053 --> 17:06.646
He's learned how to
go into people's minds

17:06.647 --> 17:11.959
and find out what scares
them, and then project that..

17:11.960 --> 17:13.694
Back to them.

17:13.694 --> 17:17.232
I'm starting to think the seven
foot man is a shape-shifter.

17:17.233 --> 17:21.902
He's able to change form and take on
the likeness of people's greatest fears.

17:21.903 --> 17:23.771
He might harm people.

17:23.771 --> 17:26.868
Why would he.. Would he do that?

17:26.869 --> 17:30.111
Maybe if he felt like they were..

17:30.112 --> 17:33.172
Gonna make him leave.

17:34.015 --> 17:37.452
So have you seen anything
else you can't explain?

17:37.453 --> 17:40.925
I just arrived here one day and..

17:40.926 --> 17:43.578
Walked in and looked over and..

17:43.579 --> 17:47.127
Thought I had a small
bear hiding in the lobby.

17:47.128 --> 17:49.597
He was about 3 feet tall.

17:49.598 --> 17:52.730
And, uh, so I had my
forty-four with me..

17:52.731 --> 17:55.370
And I was running over to it,

17:55.371 --> 17:57.586
and it took off and it..

17:57.587 --> 18:01.008
Went through this little
hole in the stairs.

18:01.009 --> 18:02.644
About that size.

18:02.645 --> 18:03.778
Okay.

18:03.779 --> 18:06.614
So I ran down there,
scoured the basement..

18:06.615 --> 18:09.065
There was nothing there.

18:09.066 --> 18:13.206
I do think there is some evil here.

18:32.854 --> 18:34.626
Pam, what's the story with this place?

18:34.627 --> 18:37.291
Uh, what's this.. Is it for
sale? Is it not for sale?

18:37.292 --> 18:39.550
It's for sale. It's been for
sale for a long, long time,

18:39.551 --> 18:40.996
probably ten years or more.

18:40.997 --> 18:43.213
Now have you sold
places like this before?

18:43.214 --> 18:46.031
I've sold lodges throughout
the state of Alaska, yeah.

18:46.032 --> 18:47.966
Now do they sell pretty quick?

18:47.967 --> 18:49.575
It doesn't usually take ten years.

18:49.576 --> 18:51.070
Okay, so that's unusual.

18:51.071 --> 18:52.504
I think so, yeah.

18:52.505 --> 18:55.852
Have you heard any stories about
this place, as far it being haunted?

18:55.853 --> 18:57.882
You know, e.. Ever since I

18:57.883 --> 19:00.419
started coming up here 35
years ago, I've heard stories.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.247
- That long?
- Yes.

19:02.248 --> 19:06.785
Now do you know about any deaths that
occurred in this place or around it?

19:06.786 --> 19:09.405
With a place like this, there's bound
to have been lots of people die here.

19:09.406 --> 19:10.978
It's been here since 1931.

19:10.979 --> 19:15.061
It was built for the miners to
come in from their gold mines

19:15.062 --> 19:19.802
to have food and
recreation on the weekends.

19:30.341 --> 19:34.301
I feel like there's, like, holes.

19:36.577 --> 19:39.157
There's holes.

19:39.818 --> 19:42.275
There's, like, all these men down here.

19:42.276 --> 19:46.416
They're, like, digging down, working.

19:47.926 --> 19:51.046
Like, under the floor.

19:51.502 --> 19:55.462
It's really, really hot in there.

20:06.069 --> 20:09.456
Working with Amy, I've met lots of
people who have experienced weird things,

20:09.457 --> 20:11.308
but nothing like this.

20:11.309 --> 20:14.210
I'm driving 140 miles
back down to Fairbanks

20:14.211 --> 20:17.280
to meet the 95-year-old
owner of the hotel.

20:17.281 --> 20:23.041
Maybe he can give me some new
information about the place.

20:31.962 --> 20:34.564
So, Bob, when did you buy the resort?

20:34.565 --> 20:36.265
May of 1980.

20:36.266 --> 20:37.203
Okay.

20:37.204 --> 20:38.738
Now let me ask you something.
You closed it, right?

20:38.739 --> 20:41.319
Yeah, in 2002.

20:41.402 --> 20:43.252
Okay. W.. Why'd you close it?

20:43.253 --> 20:46.737
My age and I didn't want to
put up with any more managers.

20:46.738 --> 20:48.797
Now you're trying to sell it?

20:48.798 --> 20:49.599
Yeah.

20:49.600 --> 20:55.240
Why do you think you're
having a tough time selling it?

20:55.809 --> 20:59.728
Ooh, they.. There's getting a lot
of stories floatin' around about it.

20:59.729 --> 21:02.722
Bill the caretaker up there..
Do you think he's a good guy?

21:02.723 --> 21:04.456
Oh, very, very honest.

21:04.457 --> 21:06.993
So if he says something may be
going on, do you believe him?

21:06.994 --> 21:09.235
Yes. Oh, yeah, very much so. Yeah.

21:09.236 --> 21:10.096
Okay.

21:10.097 --> 21:13.588
Have you ever heard any
strange stories up there?

21:13.589 --> 21:17.408
Oh, I've heard 'em but then I..
I never paid much attention to 'em

21:17.409 --> 21:19.090
because I think about it and say..

21:19.091 --> 21:22.780
"Ah, that's a bunch.. Bunch
of baloney about these ghosts".

21:22.781 --> 21:24.095
All right, so you don't
think it's haunted?

21:24.096 --> 21:25.242
- No.
- You don't?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.184
No.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.679
Okay, but there's a of people saying
a lot of things up there, right?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.831
Yeah, that's.. But it's not true.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.752
Okay.

21:38.316 --> 21:41.565
While I'm down in Fairbanks, I need
to make use of the local library

21:41.566 --> 21:46.126
to get some background
info on the hotel.

21:46.404 --> 21:50.274
As I'm looking through the newspaper
archives, something catches my eye..

21:50.275 --> 21:55.679
A deadly helicopter crash
involving a newly married bride.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.056
Her destination?

21:58.057 --> 22:01.717
The Circle Hot Springs Resort.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.092
Ugh.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.833
There's a woman.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.680
She has a dress on.

22:25.681 --> 22:29.581
Like, her.. She's all messed up.

22:36.235 --> 22:38.140
I wanna learn more
about the newlywed couple

22:38.141 --> 22:40.970
whose helicopter crashed near the hotel.

22:40.971 --> 22:43.589
I'm headed over to meet with
a local aeronautical expert

22:43.590 --> 22:49.490
who might be able to give me more
information than the newspaper article did.

22:54.344 --> 22:56.371
During my investigation,
I came across this article,

22:56.372 --> 22:58.861
uh, about a helicopter
crash back in 2002.

22:58.862 --> 23:01.130
It sounded pretty sad. It was bride.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.340
Do you like anything about it?

23:02.341 --> 23:06.291
It was a local couple doing a, uh,
wedding ceremony on one of the summits.

23:06.292 --> 23:07.443
She was a teacher.

23:07.444 --> 23:09.922
What happened was that they
were finishing up the ceremony,

23:09.923 --> 23:11.373
the weather was moving in.

23:11.374 --> 23:14.701
As they were departing to take off
and go back to Circle Hot Springs

23:14.702 --> 23:20.602
for the reception, they ended up
crashing into the side of the hill.

23:26.831 --> 23:29.916
She's not wearing anything very..

23:29.917 --> 23:30.951
Distinct.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.712
It's just white.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.665
What the (Bleep) Is she doing?

23:37.666 --> 23:40.683
She's, like, spinnin'.

23:40.684 --> 23:45.223
Like, she's spinning.
Her equilibrium is.. Out.

23:45.224 --> 23:48.644
She's, like, falling down.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.677
Oh, (Bleep).

23:50.678 --> 23:53.978
I feel, like, uh, blood.

23:56.177 --> 23:58.919
What would it feel like if they
were going down and they knew it?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.603
You assume everything's all
right, and then all of a sudden,

24:00.604 --> 24:02.986
you hit, and before you
know it, it's all over with.

24:02.987 --> 24:05.436
In a situation like this, they didn't
have any time to think about it.

24:05.437 --> 24:07.194
They.. They didn't know what happened.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.311
Most of the guests didn't even
know anything had occurred.

24:09.312 --> 24:15.212
They discovered the crash site as they
were driving back for the reception.

24:18.397 --> 24:20.244
Ohh.

24:20.245 --> 24:24.205
It's like, really bad here, here.

24:24.512 --> 24:26.732
Bad. Bad.

24:30.684 --> 24:32.604
What happened? What happened?

24:32.605 --> 24:36.445
I don't know. Sh.. Oh, my God.

24:37.078 --> 24:38.658
This is not good.

24:38.659 --> 24:41.895
Ah! (Bleep), she's cold.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.130
Ah.

24:43.131 --> 24:45.225
One of the problems,
though, up there, there's..

24:45.226 --> 24:47.574
There's no ambulance service.
There's no Fire Department.

24:47.575 --> 24:49.335
There's no hospital. There's
no cell phone coverage.

24:49.336 --> 24:52.088
So I think what they did
is they piled them into cars

24:52.089 --> 24:53.134
and drove 'em back to Fairbanks..

24:53.135 --> 24:55.180
- Aw, jeez.
- And, um, to pronounce her dead

24:55.181 --> 24:56.944
at the hospital here
in Fairbanks, you know.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.283
So if it wasn't for the
fact that they were in

24:58.284 --> 25:00.106
such a desolate area,
she might've made it.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.387
Definitely.

25:06.799 --> 25:11.869
She's.. I think.. I think she wants help,
but, like, nobody.. There is nobody..

25:11.870 --> 25:16.730
I don't know. There's
nobody, nobody, nobody.

25:17.615 --> 25:22.355
I.. I.. I know sh..
Sh.. Sh.. She's dying.

25:22.994 --> 25:26.234
Yeah, she's dying here.

25:41.467 --> 25:46.439
So far, all I've uncovered about the
property is a tragic helicopter crash.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.144
But my clients have a laundry
list of paranormal encounters.

25:50.145 --> 25:56.045
I'm hoping that by meeting with a local
historian I can fill in some of the blanks.

26:02.088 --> 26:05.510
The Hot Springs were discovered in 1897,

26:05.511 --> 26:09.651
and Frank Leach owned it as of 1924

26:09.943 --> 26:11.706
with Emma Leach.

26:11.707 --> 26:15.568
The land.. He owns it and he built
the Hot Springs Hotel. What year?

26:15.569 --> 26:16.970
1930.

26:16.971 --> 26:18.238
What kind of a guy was he?

26:18.239 --> 26:19.941
He was rather laid-back.

26:19.942 --> 26:24.944
Hard worker. He was very handy.
Uh, he loved to build things.

26:24.945 --> 26:28.106
He built furniture for the
hotel, things like that.

26:28.107 --> 26:30.583
What can you tell me
about Frank's wife Emma?

26:30.584 --> 26:33.267
Emma was born in..

26:33.268 --> 26:36.368
1890, and her maiden name was Gunz.

26:36.369 --> 26:38.533
And I think it may have been German.

26:38.534 --> 26:41.747
She, uh, she told him what to do.

26:41.748 --> 26:44.671
Quite often, you'd
hear her yelling at him.

26:44.672 --> 26:50.192
She was the boss, so she
wasn't, uh, thoroughly loved.

26:57.043 --> 26:59.056
And then there's this other woman.

26:59.057 --> 27:01.193
She's from overseas.

27:01.194 --> 27:05.013
She reminds me of like
this.. German Grandmother.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.527
Does she have an accent?

27:06.528 --> 27:08.054
Oh, yeah.

27:08.055 --> 27:09.388
She speaks another language.

27:09.389 --> 27:11.851
She's just very set in her ways.

27:11.852 --> 27:14.914
Like, rough, very gruff..

27:14.915 --> 27:17.873
Harsh, overbearing, and..

27:17.874 --> 27:20.214
Just nasty.

27:20.439 --> 27:25.359
She threatened to push
my head into the table.

27:27.591 --> 27:29.709
Apparently she doesn't like me.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.915
That's kind of how she is.

27:32.916 --> 27:35.926
Now did Frank and Emma stay
in Alaska or did they move on?

27:35.927 --> 27:40.323
Actually, they lived, uh,
in a house behind the hotel..

27:40.324 --> 27:42.425
- Okay.
- Until the both of them died.

27:42.426 --> 27:48.326
And, uh, they're buried in the Hot
Springs Cemetery, behind the hotel.

28:01.908 --> 28:04.899
I saw several entities on
my walk, but I decided to

28:04.900 --> 28:08.356
have a sketch artist draw
the most prominent two.

28:08.357 --> 28:10.601
First, the seven foot-tall man.

28:10.602 --> 28:13.662
He was very muscular.

28:16.389 --> 28:19.069
Very, like, intimidating.

28:19.070 --> 28:21.830
He had a large..

28:22.537 --> 28:23.863
Axe.

28:23.864 --> 28:26.683
Can you describe his face for me?

28:26.684 --> 28:28.656
And the eyes squared,

28:28.657 --> 28:31.957
because they're so deep.

28:32.904 --> 28:34.993
And then the angry woman.

28:34.994 --> 28:38.266
She had dark brown hair.

28:38.267 --> 28:42.515
It comes up like this
and just goes back.

28:42.516 --> 28:44.196
What was the shape of her face?

28:44.197 --> 28:47.737
Uh, it was kind of squared.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.123
She has very thin lips.

28:50.124 --> 28:55.224
She had very full cheeks
and the were very high.

28:56.196 --> 28:59.256
Is this who you saw?

28:59.787 --> 29:01.647
Yes.

29:25.141 --> 29:29.645
Over the last several days, Amy and I
have conducted separate investigations.

29:29.646 --> 29:31.380
Now we're going to reveal our findings

29:31.381 --> 29:36.541
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.649
Heather and Dawn don't live here.

29:43.650 --> 29:46.656
Their Father Bill here,
uh, takes care of the hotel.

29:46.657 --> 29:50.090
They've experienced some
pretty terrifying things here

29:50.091 --> 29:53.320
and they're.. They're worried about
him, but he doesn't want to leave.

29:53.321 --> 29:59.221
With that, I'm gonna ask Amy to
talk about her walk a little bit.

30:02.071 --> 30:07.276
During my walk, one of the individuals
that I encountered is a female.

30:07.277 --> 30:11.781
Unfortunately, she's stuck in her death
state because her death was so traumatic

30:11.782 --> 30:15.442
that she hasn't been able to move on.

30:15.443 --> 30:17.855
There's a woman..

30:17.856 --> 30:21.156
I feel, like, uh, blood.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.602
I think she's dying.

30:25.603 --> 30:31.040
I saw her, like, bumping around the
second floor because her equilibrium's off.

30:31.041 --> 30:35.328
And she is very hurt and
confused because she was

30:35.329 --> 30:38.708
calling out for help, and
nobody was there to help her.

30:38.709 --> 30:41.476
About ten years, there
was a newlywed couple

30:41.477 --> 30:43.445
who had taken their
vows not far from here,

30:43.446 --> 30:46.962
and they were headed here to
have the reception, to this place.

30:46.963 --> 30:49.697
Said "I do," got into a helicopter.

30:49.698 --> 30:51.602
And she never made it to her reception.

30:51.603 --> 30:54.116
The helicopter crashed.

30:54.117 --> 30:55.266
She died.

30:55.267 --> 30:56.835
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

30:56.836 --> 30:58.449
I mean, they were alone.

30:58.450 --> 31:00.005
She didn't die right away.

31:00.006 --> 31:03.546
Head trauma and body trauma.

31:04.170 --> 31:06.871
I didn't see a helicopter
crash related to this woman

31:06.872 --> 31:08.960
and I never saw her face clearly.

31:08.961 --> 31:10.576
So I don't know who she is,

31:10.577 --> 31:14.284
but I do know she doesn't want
to harm anyone in the hotel.

31:14.285 --> 31:16.291
What else happened during your walk?

31:16.292 --> 31:19.529
Another individual that I encountered..

31:19.530 --> 31:22.612
Was a very, very rough woman.

31:22.613 --> 31:26.830
Very tough um, she
looked, like, German to me.

31:26.831 --> 31:30.000
She didn't really like me very much.

31:30.001 --> 31:32.864
She's just very overbearing.
Like, reminded me

31:32.865 --> 31:37.173
of one of those overbearing
Grandmother types.

31:37.174 --> 31:42.146
She's just very set in
her ways and dressed nasty.

31:42.147 --> 31:47.067
She threatened to push
my head into the table.

31:47.220 --> 31:51.164
Heather, do me a favor and tell Amy
about the apparition you did see.

31:51.165 --> 31:53.017
Um, I was outside by the pool.

31:53.018 --> 31:56.721
And I looked up at the fourth
floor window by the library.

31:56.722 --> 32:01.642
And I saw kind of like
a grandmotherly figure.

32:01.839 --> 32:05.945
Do you know the name Emma.. Emma Leach?

32:05.946 --> 32:09.401
Emma married this guy Frank Leach.

32:09.402 --> 32:12.576
And, actually, Frank
built this hotel in 1930.

32:12.577 --> 32:14.906
Her maiden name is Gunz. She was German.

32:14.907 --> 32:19.016
She was overbearing, told
her husband what to do.

32:19.017 --> 32:22.268
Pretty sure she died on the property, and
she's buried right up on the hill here.

32:22.269 --> 32:24.129
Wow.

32:24.661 --> 32:26.643
We did do a sketch of her.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.804
You did?

32:47.179 --> 32:51.019
Well, I have a picture of Emma.

32:51.443 --> 32:53.423
This..

32:53.547 --> 32:56.007
That's Emma.

32:59.032 --> 33:00.892
Wow.

33:01.929 --> 33:03.472
Heather, what do you think?

33:03.473 --> 33:07.613
I think there's a lot of similarities,
especially in the full chin.

33:07.614 --> 33:08.707
The nose.

33:08.708 --> 33:11.458
The nose was the most distinct.

33:11.459 --> 33:12.713
She didn't like you?

33:12.714 --> 33:14.720
I don't think she likes anybody.

33:14.721 --> 33:17.490
She definitely doesn't want
to leave, that's for sure.

33:17.491 --> 33:21.271
Like, this is her.. Her domain.

33:24.441 --> 33:26.199
So, Amy, what else did you encounter?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.627
I encountered this very, very tall man.

33:29.628 --> 33:33.108
Who, definitely unnerved me.

33:33.440 --> 33:39.058
I did get that he's not from here, um,
but that he built a lot of things here.

33:39.059 --> 33:43.065
And this individual is very protective

33:43.066 --> 33:45.346
of an area in the basement.

33:45.347 --> 33:47.034
Uh, the workshop area.

33:47.035 --> 33:49.681
That's, like, his.. His main place.

33:49.682 --> 33:53.559
Well, that sounds like Emma's husband
Frank, the guy that built this place.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.688
He actually built a lot of the
furniture that's in this place.

33:56.689 --> 33:58.085
- Really?
- Yeah, he was a handy guy.

33:58.086 --> 34:01.266
He's a strange person.

34:01.349 --> 34:06.853
Well, he did die on the property and
is buried right up on the same hill.

34:06.854 --> 34:10.393
He, um, he's very advanced.

34:10.630 --> 34:14.597
He's able to physically interact, so..

34:14.598 --> 34:17.341
Shaking beds, making noise,

34:17.342 --> 34:21.002
and opening and closing doors.

34:21.282 --> 34:24.018
Heather, tell Amy
what happened upstairs.

34:24.018 --> 34:27.022
I was cleaning one of the
rooms on the second floor,

34:27.023 --> 34:28.670
and I had the furniture
polish in my hand.

34:28.672 --> 34:29.898
I sat it on the chair.

34:29.899 --> 34:31.893
And so I turned around to get my rag.

34:31.893 --> 34:36.085
I grabbed it, and as soon as I turned
back around to go towards the chair,

34:36.087 --> 34:41.530
it flew off and it went right
past my face and hit the wall.

34:41.531 --> 34:43.024
You said the footsteps. He makes..

34:43.025 --> 34:44.449
- He makes the noise.
- Yeah.

34:44.451 --> 34:46.041
- You guys have all heard..
- Oh, yeah.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.165
Up and down the fire escape
on the outside of the building.

34:49.166 --> 34:50.949
And there's no.. No tracks on the snow,

34:50.951 --> 34:53.377
but you can hear him running up and
down the stairs, the fire escape..

34:53.378 --> 34:54.291
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.627
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

34:55.628 --> 34:57.199
He's very capable..

34:57.200 --> 34:59.629
He.. He also tried to frighten me.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.360
The way that he
presented himself to me..

35:02.361 --> 35:06.501
Uh, was unnerving, to say the least.

35:08.137 --> 35:10.278
You gotta tell her about
this 3-headed thing.

35:10.279 --> 35:12.056
What?

35:12.057 --> 35:16.540
There's five of us that have seen
it, and we seen it at the same time.

35:16.541 --> 35:18.342
We all seen something
different. Like, for instance,

35:18.343 --> 35:20.448
I've seen what I thought would've
been maybe the Grim Reaper.

35:20.449 --> 35:22.752
He had seen a monkey
head that I didn't see.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.044
There was no emotion
or nothing in the head.

35:24.045 --> 35:26.989
It had no eyes and everything.
This was dark, black eyes.

35:26.990 --> 35:28.656
I mean, I was very scared.

35:28.657 --> 35:31.894
That bothers me, when they
have enough strength to do that,

35:31.895 --> 35:35.495
to be able to read your mind..

35:35.496 --> 35:38.115
And see what scares you.

35:38.116 --> 35:41.176
And then become that.

35:43.425 --> 35:46.524
Well, it's funny you mention
that because Bill's wife Colette..

35:46.525 --> 35:49.765
Uh, who I had spoken to,
she had an incident where..

35:49.766 --> 35:52.307
She saw what she thought
was a black bear in here.

35:52.308 --> 35:54.696
Because she assumed she'd
caught it sleeping out here.

35:54.697 --> 35:56.934
She caught it right over
there in this corner.

35:56.935 --> 35:58.450
- Oh!
- She was going for her fourty-four

35:58.451 --> 36:00.056
and starting to pull it
out, and then all of a sudden

36:00.057 --> 36:02.049
it turned into, like, a changeling.

36:02.050 --> 36:06.430
And went down one of
them holes over here.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.645
But the changeling, Amy, that's..

36:07.646 --> 36:09.645
That's what's freaking us out.

36:09.646 --> 36:13.486
I did, um, have a sketch done..

36:13.542 --> 36:14.439
Of him.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.574
Is that the second sketch you did?

36:15.575 --> 36:18.155
- Yes.
- Okay.

36:19.834 --> 36:21.634
Oh.

36:22.425 --> 36:25.347
That's.. That would scare me.

36:25.348 --> 36:29.248
I wanted you to notice the eyes.

36:29.851 --> 36:32.971
He really hates women.

36:45.351 --> 36:48.411
I did have a sketch done..

36:48.412 --> 36:49.295
Of him.

36:49.296 --> 36:50.382
Is that the second sketch you did?

36:50.383 --> 36:52.963
- Yes.
- Okay.

36:54.727 --> 36:56.527
Oh.

37:12.779 --> 37:17.459
I got chills when I
started looking at it.

37:17.953 --> 37:23.474
One of the things that bothers
me was what you said about..

37:23.475 --> 37:28.215
The eyes being two big,
black, gaping holes.

37:33.383 --> 37:37.300
Yeah, these are the black eyes
that I seen in the 2-headed thing.

37:37.301 --> 37:40.121
Exactly like that.

37:40.206 --> 37:42.315
That's what it made you see?

37:42.316 --> 37:44.116
Mm.

37:45.228 --> 37:49.728
I feel that there's two things going on.

37:49.881 --> 37:52.814
One, it's very unnerving..

37:52.815 --> 37:57.495
To not be able to
look at someone's eyes.

37:58.107 --> 37:59.794
You can't gauge them.

37:59.795 --> 38:01.656
You don't know what's going on.

38:01.657 --> 38:05.760
So it gives you a
feeling of disorientation.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.985
And the biggest thing
with him was that..

38:08.986 --> 38:12.209
He actually really hates women.

38:12.210 --> 38:15.884
Like, he wouldn't really talk
to me because I was just a girl.

38:15.885 --> 38:16.750
Oh, wow.

38:16.751 --> 38:18.205
- I said that, too. Remember?
- Yep.

38:18.206 --> 38:20.073
I said the only ones who
are having problems it seems,

38:20.074 --> 38:22.889
like Amy in this.. This
area here is the women.

38:22.890 --> 38:24.724
The men.. He has no problem there.

38:24.725 --> 38:26.989
But the women, he just
does not like them.

38:26.990 --> 38:28.875
Bill, isn't it true that whatever's here

38:28.876 --> 38:30.845
you told me is kinda helping you out,

38:30.846 --> 38:33.190
helping you find things
and stuff like that?

38:33.191 --> 38:36.123
He's quite the assistant. Yes, he is.

38:36.124 --> 38:41.107
The odd thing is, the only time you
ever saw something remotely scary..

38:41.108 --> 38:42.394
Was when you were with four other women.

38:42.395 --> 38:43.319
- Yes. Yep.
- Ohh. Yep.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.578
- Oh, yeah. That makes sense.
- Mm-hmm.

38:44.579 --> 38:47.693
Yeah, it was me and four women, so..

38:47.694 --> 38:49.053
Wow.

38:49.054 --> 38:53.434
You're hitting a lot on the head, Amy.

38:56.957 --> 39:00.361
Well, guys, you've seen what Amy
and I have uncovered about the hotel.

39:00.362 --> 39:03.108
But the reason you called us in,
the most important question is,

39:03.109 --> 39:07.090
is it safe for your Father
here to stay on as a caretaker?

39:07.091 --> 39:12.991
Um, so with that, I'm gonna ask Amy
if she can answer that question for us.

39:14.709 --> 39:18.824
Well, I think it's
safe for your Father..

39:18.825 --> 39:20.368
Because you're male.

39:20.369 --> 39:22.616
Uh, but, you know, it's..

39:22.617 --> 39:27.259
It's kind of unsettling for
when you daughters visit.

39:27.260 --> 39:30.320
What you can do is..

39:30.657 --> 39:33.741
Have a talking with him.

39:33.742 --> 39:37.222
Um, about bothering females.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.380
And kind of laying down the law.

39:41.402 --> 39:46.742
"If there's females here,
you just leave 'em alone".

39:46.911 --> 39:49.971
"No interaction, or"..

39:50.309 --> 39:52.829
"You're gonna have to go".

39:52.830 --> 39:56.631
Do you think his talking-to is
gonna stop that for his girls?

39:56.632 --> 39:59.819
What can be done to ensure
their safety when they're here?

39:59.820 --> 40:05.720
They know now who the people are,
so they can call them out by name.

40:05.788 --> 40:08.495
So you believe these sketches
are Frank and Emma Leach?

40:08.496 --> 40:10.464
Oh, yeah.

40:10.465 --> 40:12.525
You know, Bill's going
to lay down the law.

40:12.526 --> 40:17.637
Like, "if you wanna stay here,
these are the terms and conditions".

40:17.638 --> 40:20.107
"You don't mess with any women".

40:20.108 --> 40:22.008
"You don't disrespect them,"

40:22.009 --> 40:24.144
and so on and so forth.

40:24.145 --> 40:28.982
And then you guys coming in, being
like, "we're not gonna tolerate this".

40:28.983 --> 40:33.610
And if you do anything,
you know the consequences,"

40:33.611 --> 40:36.621
which will be banishment, basically.

40:36.622 --> 40:39.293
And they do not want that.

40:39.294 --> 40:42.848
Most people don't realize that
entities can remain at a location

40:42.849 --> 40:45.145
because they are allowed to.

40:45.146 --> 40:46.800
But if they start causing problems,

40:46.801 --> 40:50.537
you can put your foot down
and demand that they leave.

40:50.538 --> 40:54.241
How do you feel knowing all this now?
Do you feel better? You feel worse?

40:54.242 --> 40:59.365
I feel better knowing that it's nothing
against men and knowing that he'll be okay.

40:59.366 --> 41:02.269
However, it's a little upsetting that..

41:02.270 --> 41:03.797
It has something against us.

41:03.798 --> 41:06.162
Well, not personally,
but women, just because..

41:06.163 --> 41:08.396
I.. I enjoy coming
over to the Hot Springs

41:08.397 --> 41:11.379
and we have fun when we stay here..

41:11.380 --> 41:13.288
Until all that started happening.

41:13.289 --> 41:16.184
So, I think, Dad, you
need to have a talk.

41:16.185 --> 41:17.132
Yeah.

41:17.133 --> 41:18.337
As one man to another.

41:18.338 --> 41:19.348
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Right.

41:19.349 --> 41:23.319
We're buddies so let's keep it that
way. And, you know, like, well..

41:23.320 --> 41:24.835
Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that.

41:24.836 --> 41:26.675
- I will.
- Doing it to protect your daughters.

41:26.676 --> 41:28.596
Yeah.

41:30.174 --> 41:32.576
I can relate to Dawn
and Heather's fears.

41:32.577 --> 41:36.780
When you've encountered such an
angry presence, it's terrifying.

41:36.781 --> 41:39.417
But as long as Bill follows
the advice I've given him,

41:39.418 --> 41:43.078
his family should remain safe.
