WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.208
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:02.377 --> 00:04.585
You must warn Waverly,
and you take her away.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.917
Where is the last seal?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.626
- Do you swear?
- I do.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.961
Those things that look like

00:10.135 --> 00:12.172
Mercedes and Beth aren't.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.430
- Demons took their place.
- Ah!

00:15.599 --> 00:17.807
- I'm with Nicole.
- I'm with Doc.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.558
Funny thing
about being a revenant...

00:19.728 --> 00:21.344
- He loved Waverly.
- That's no excuse.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.514
- Nicole, stop.
- The deed shall be done.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.522
- It is the law.
- Get up in her face.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.309
- And make things right.
- Waves?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.819
Mercedes. God, your face.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.858
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going around.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.824
My husband, my lord,
has illuminated the path,

00:38.997 --> 00:41.205
and the path leads to you -
the law.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.289
How foolish
must the Earp wench feel...

00:47.464 --> 00:51.504
knowing you had the seal
all this time?

00:53.428 --> 00:56.091
- I don't... Ah!
- Ah...

00:56.265 --> 00:57.972
Please. I don't know
anything about that.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.884
- I would have told Wynonna.
- You may not know you have it.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.429
It could be metal,
precious and very, very old.

01:04.605 --> 01:05.972
I'm more of an IKEA kinda girl.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.015
My lord does not make mistakes!

01:08.193 --> 01:11.152
Get away from her, you bitch!

01:12.698 --> 01:14.485
Pick on someone your own size.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.945
Oh, that's cute.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.702
Neither of us know where
the third seal is, Mercedes,

01:22.749 --> 01:24.285
but we are available
for nose jobs.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.042
Mercedes isn't here right now.
You'll have to play with me.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.514
Ah!

01:42.853 --> 01:44.310
No!

01:46.523 --> 01:48.480
- Ah!
- Waverly!

01:53.572 --> 01:55.734
No! No!

01:57.492 --> 01:59.449
You're telling the truth.
You don't have it.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.532
Well, that's embarrassing.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.446
My husband's rings told the future.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.833
The one who holds the seal
is still coming here!

02:10.881 --> 02:14.545
Oh, my God!
Baby! Baby, stay with me. OK?

02:14.718 --> 02:17.552
- Shh. You're OK.
- Please don't touch.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.715
Shh. Baby. Stay with me, OK?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.511
Don't die. Don't die.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.498
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.289
I'm talking biblical,
end of the world,

02:54.466 --> 02:56.253
'Deep Impact', 'Armageddon',

02:56.426 --> 02:58.713
season 19 of 'America's
Next Top Model' combined.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.675
- It usually is with you.
- You're not gonna ask me why?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.841
It's questions like that that
got Michael Bay into trouble.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.884
Deep-core drillers in space?
Come on.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.224
I would like to know
where the can is, though.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.317
- Thank you.
- Kill them hard, Wynonna.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.570
Town's had enough of this shit.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.555
Can you believe not a single
vending machine in this place

03:24.579 --> 03:26.366
sells candy?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.699
Bladder's camping out
on my lungs.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.708
Give me some goddamn Twizzlers.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.586
You don't even know
about the baby.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.044
Oh, you, you're gonna be like,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.460
"Course you would
get knocked up, you dumb ho."

03:44.808 --> 03:46.720
I'm so sorry, Mercedes.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.312
She's malnourished.
Lost a lot of blood.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.231
And down a face, so...

03:54.401 --> 03:56.921
- Bet the doctors have questions.
- Yeah, they're being handled.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.279
You knew at the Gardner house
something wasn't right.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.862
There's nothing
you could have done.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.993
- You saved her life.
- Couldn't save the real Beth.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.405
Beth might have been
the lucky one.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.744
They kept them alive like this.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.831
Faceless. For fun?
For punishment?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.712
For food?

04:16.882 --> 04:19.339
Trying not to think about
the reasons.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.421
Only the retribution.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.133
I'm gonna find you
some liquorice if it kills me.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.423
- OK.
- Yep.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.181
Juan Carlo,
the fire at the church.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.476
Clootie's wives
are kicking our ass.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.237
Please! Somebody
help her! She's not breathing!

04:42.407 --> 04:45.445
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.
You're gonna be fine, OK?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.360
- You're gonna be...
- Step back, please.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.073
Mattie?

04:49.247 --> 04:51.204
- Gretta, bag her.
- On it.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.161
- Oh, her sister.
- Get her into Trauma One.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.792
Start an IV and get her vitals.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.497
Miss, I need you
to stay back here.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.458
What?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.634
Hey. I'm here.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.591
Tell me everything.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.308
I was on my way over
because we'd been fighting.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.279
God, she can't die
while we're still fighting.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.722
OK. I know it's hard.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.811
- Just try to breathe.
- I cheated on her.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.352
Yeah. I'm a cheater.
Rosita. I kissed her.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.362
OK, one kiss is not...

05:23.532 --> 05:25.319
- Rosita is...
- What, Doc's girlfriend?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.108
Yeah. Oh, and a revenant.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.658
Later.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.958
So Mercedes attacked Nicole. Why?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.460
Widow Mercedes thought
that Nicole had the third seal.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.872
Not possible.
It's safe and sound.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.330
And it's the only thing keeping
Clootie from resurrecting.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.586
The Widows won't find it ever.
They can't.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.471
You know where the third seal is
and you didn't tell me?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.387
Nobody can know where it is
but me.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.928
- That way, nobody gets hurt.
- Nicole got hurt!

05:56.106 --> 05:58.018
That's not what I meant.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.602
I'm sorry.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.110
Nicole was bitten
because of me, Wynonna.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.646
She saved me.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.657
Now, I...

06:07.826 --> 06:09.362
I need some air.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.865
Mercedes bit her?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.584
The Widows bit Juan Carlo.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.494
He was already dying
when he kidnapped you.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.392
Yeah, but Nicole is young
and tough as hell.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.360
Yeah, well, Juan Carlo was
a bullshit enchanted prophet

06:24.384 --> 06:26.104
and it was still gruesome -
he was in agony.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.531
- This isn't a normal wound.
- How long you think she has?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.342
Two, maybe three hours.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.008
Well, then, we find or make
or buy some kind of...

06:34.185 --> 06:36.518
anti thing - antivenom,
like for a rattler bite.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.101
- We can try.
- No. No.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.641
They're not taking another one.
Not today.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.151
Whatever it takes, Dolls.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.861
God, this can't be happening.
This can't be...

06:56.249 --> 06:58.286
This can't be happening.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.996
Oh, but it is.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.536
Beth.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.126
No. Not Beth.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.337
Who are you really?
What are you?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.297
Hungry, mostly.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.133
And you smell...

07:11.306 --> 07:12.922
rare.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.681
Your sister
attacked my girlfriend.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.387
She's not really my sister.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.361
She's more like
my demon husband's other wife.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.804
I don't care.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.847
But I thought
that we were bonding.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.893
You can stay
or I can make you stay.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.529
Mercedes thought that
Nicole had the Stone Witch's seal.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.112
Dumb bitch. But she was right
about one thing.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.119
She got lucky when
she bit Nicole instead of you.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.780
Because now the heir's sister
has motivation.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.621
- To help me.
- I would never.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.501
Only I can cure her.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.253
What?

07:44.422 --> 07:47.005
But... the doctors...

07:47.175 --> 07:50.339
Human doctors?
How adorable are you?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.550
Why don't you ask your marshal
what happened to Juan Carlo?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.965
Or, better yet,
why don't you go take a look

07:56.142 --> 07:57.678
at his body for yourself,

07:57.852 --> 07:59.844
see what our venom does
to human flesh.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.058
Tell me how to save her.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.100
Oh. Bullets can't kill us.

08:05.276 --> 08:09.020
I admire your bravery, though.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.861
I believe your sister knows
where the last seal is.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.072
Find it, give it to me,
and only me,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.283
and I'll save
your little lover's life.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.664
I would never betray Wynonna.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.702
Well, then, I guess you better
get to picking out a casket,

08:23.878 --> 08:25.961
say, yea tall.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.840
Hey. There you are.
Wynonna's in there with her.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.926
Hey. You alright?
You're shaking.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.760
Yeah, just cold.
What did the doctors say?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.390
They can't identify
what bit her.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.561
- But I ordered a tox screen.
- What? But, Dolls...

08:41.604 --> 08:42.970
They want to induce a coma,

08:43.148 --> 08:45.310
slow the venom's move
through her system.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.773
But Nicole said that she won't
go under until she... sees you.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.575
How's she doing?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.281
Just...

08:59.998 --> 09:02.411
Oh, my God, it burns.
Please make it stop.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.667
Get her something for the pain.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.169
Mercedes says...

09:08.339 --> 09:09.921
the path leads to the law.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.798
Shh. Save your strength, Haught.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.006
- Wynonna, if this gets bad...
- This ain't bad?

09:15.180 --> 09:18.264
Just listen for once, Earp, OK?
I don't want to be a burden.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.176
And I don't want a machine
keeping my body alive.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.389
And we both know
Waverly's not gonna let me go.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.270
Nicole, please don't ask me
to do this.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.898
You're the only one that can.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.651
And you're the only one
she's gonna forgive.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.321
Please. Please.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.783
OK.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.862
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.873
- I'm here. I'm here.
- I'll go get the doctor.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.376
- Hey.
- Shh, shh.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.707
You give Calamity Jane
to Nedley, OK?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.401
He's gonna pretend
he doesn't want her,

09:51.549 --> 09:52.960
but he loves that damn cat.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.502
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.797
I am so sorry, Waverly,
for everything. I made a...

09:59.974 --> 10:01.840
- I made a huge mistake.
- No.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.996
Forget about the DNA results,
OK? It doesn't matter.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.559
Yes, it does. It does matter.
Especially now.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.319
I just really thought
I was doing the right thing,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.185
but I lied to you,
and I shouldn't have...

10:13.363 --> 10:16.481
Hey. I'm gonna be here
when you wake up, OK?

10:16.658 --> 10:19.822
And we're gonna do
all of our sorrys then. OK?

10:19.994 --> 10:22.953
We're gonna have a big old
sorry party. I'll make hats.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.207
But if I don't...

10:27.377 --> 10:29.334
no matter what happens,

10:29.504 --> 10:31.336
I need you to know

10:31.506 --> 10:35.876
that I have never loved anyone
the way that I love you.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.336
You know what?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.722
Nope. We're not doing this.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.766
We're gonna find...

10:44.936 --> 10:46.848
We're gonna find a way
to stop the toxin, OK?

10:47.021 --> 10:50.185
You're gonna be just fine.
You're gonna be fine.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.746
Jeremy, is this everything
you've got on the Widows?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.325
Yeah.
OK, the effect of the poison was immediate.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.459
But, uh... she could still move.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.292
My guess, the same toxin
they spray as a paralysing agent.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.025
But in that case,
the poison is inhaled.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.171
Less concentrated.
Different effect.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.631
You mean instead of freezing you
in place, it kills you?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.673
Exactly. The Widows
are basically super-predators.

11:23.850 --> 11:28.060
Like komodo dragons.
Which are so cool and...

11:28.229 --> 11:30.516
Shit. I am... I'm sorry.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.023
No, Jeremy. It's...
It's fine. Um...

11:33.193 --> 11:35.150
You know,
komodos are really cool.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.358
OK, but this is good, right?
I mean...

11:38.531 --> 11:40.759
I mean, you've already been
experimenting with the venom?

11:40.783 --> 11:43.321
Well, creating a vapour guard
against their mist, yeah, but...

11:43.494 --> 11:45.360
This is a whole different
Quidditch game.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.746
I don't need 'Star Trek'
references. Tell me what to do.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.329
- Get more venom.
- Yeah. And a test subject.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.208
- I'll do it.
- No.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.461
You're human. The cure
is worse than the poison.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.213
It'll kill you
like it's killing Nicole.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.749
Damn it!
Sensitivity training, Jeremy.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.759
OK, everyone.
Stop walking on eggshells, OK?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.637
I know Nicole is dying,
there's a really piss-poor chance

12:03.806 --> 12:05.297
that we're
gonna save her, OK, but...

12:05.475 --> 12:07.137
Can we all just act
like we're...

12:07.310 --> 12:08.972
winning, for once?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.680
Jesus, Jeremy,
how can you even work like...

12:14.400 --> 12:17.689
- Your Optimug Prime.
- Oh. It's OK.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.622
It's OK. It's not important.
It's just a mug.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.444
I'm basically a genius.
I can fix it.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.360
But what if you can't?
Wynonna, what if he can't?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.027
He can.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.913
We will.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.289
This third seal, Constance's seal,
is it worth all of this?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.624
OK...
We could use it to lure the Widows.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.915
We all love Nicole, baby girl,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.175
and there is no way in hell
she's dying today.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.552
You trust me?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.462
Trust us?

12:46.849 --> 12:48.056
Yeah.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.968
Yeah.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.397
Do what you can
with the last of the veil juice.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.478
Let me worry
about a test subject.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.492
I'll speak to Ewan
and his jokers in the Order.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.507
They know Juan Carlo.
Juan Carlo knows the Widows.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.397
Yeah, and in that case,
they bit him,

13:03.574 --> 13:05.861
meaning his body's pumped
full of venom - might also help.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.955
- Gross as that sounds.
- Man, I've seen you eat.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.704
- I don't get grossed out.
- OK, what about us?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.708
You... Stay near your girl.
We need updates, time lines.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.539
You've already done a lot.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.705
Alright? Faux-cedes is injured,
thanks to you.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.921
That means we can track her
from Nicole's apartment.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.467
OK. Who's we?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.923
He's a pain in my ass
these days, but, damn it,

13:26.097 --> 13:28.259
Doc could find a dildo
in a nunnery.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.971
You want venom? We will
find her. And when we do...

13:36.941 --> 13:39.399
I'm gonna milk that bitch
like a snake.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.030
Doc Holliday -
greatest kong artist ever.

13:49.203 --> 13:53.243
- Did you say kong artist?
- Reduced to a pair of fours.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.123
Just playin' the cards
I've been dealt.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.285
Mmm.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.704
Full house.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.633
Lose three hands and you're out?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.261
- Suit yourselves.
- Yeah.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.343
It's not like they have forever
to win it back.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.513
Hey, Rosie.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.974
You're not supposed to
be here, Stevie.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.401
You looking for trouble?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.857
Just a decent poker game.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.523
I used to work here, for Bobo.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.319
Yeah. Bobo.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.707
Oh, easy to laugh, I guess,
now that he's dead.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.620
Get you a fresh one?
Downstairs, right?

14:42.757 --> 14:45.750
Sit tight.
Let's play another hand.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.927
- Few cards short.
- High card draw.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.143
I win, you tell me
why you're so interested

15:00.316 --> 15:02.148
in poking round in my basement.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.059
Mmm. You lose?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.069
We get you another bottle.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.030
Ooh!

15:13.204 --> 15:16.447
Whew! Smells like
Doritos and feet.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.287
- You been here all night?
- It's the heir.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bar is closed.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.672
Private game,
to which I was about to win big.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.112
I didn't know you were still
hanging with my mortal enemies.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.220
Well, one of us is mortal,
and it ain't him.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.346
I wasn't expecting you
to be cool about it.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.179
- But the pouting is getting old.
- We are born to die.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.561
And once the seal I gave you
serves its purpose,

15:39.730 --> 15:42.143
it will all be worth it,
but if you came here

15:42.316 --> 15:44.433
to try and convince me
to cover your back

15:44.610 --> 15:48.399
as you try and confront
murderous demon brides,

15:48.573 --> 15:50.815
I'm gonna have to
sleep this off first.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.693
- Nicole is dying. They bit her.
- Lead the way.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.783
Bring your knives too.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.663
I'll get the coffee.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.290
Huh.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.922
Go.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.934
Jesus.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.311
If you're trying to pass
for normal human,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.598
maybe don't jump women
in broad daylight.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.640
Just came to play
'Let's Make a Deal'.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.026
- Did you get it?
- I don't know where it is.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.153
You're a clever girl. Find it.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.157
Yes, I am clever.
I know I can't trust you.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.613
I know that breaking
the final seal will unleash...

16:35.786 --> 16:37.994
My husband, Clootie? So what?

16:38.164 --> 16:41.373
Your family's already in hell,
always in constant danger,

16:41.542 --> 16:43.579
and you're about to lose
your girlfriend.

16:43.753 --> 16:47.212
But salvation
is just a drop away.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.792
Or not.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.799
We've put down demons, witches,
even Bobo Del Rey.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.964
You'll join 'em in the ground
soon enough.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.973
Nicole will get there first.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.600
Ta-ta for now.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.856
- Wait!
- Waverly, hold up.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.857
You've got the key
to Nicole's place, right?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.867
Yeah.
Gotta pick up that mongrel cat of hers.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.229
Well, if you hate it that much,
I'll take Calamity Jane.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.815
No. Randy Nedley
is a man of his word.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.983
I got her a new scratching post.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.538
Hey. Hey. Uh...

17:21.707 --> 17:26.792
Chin up. Officer Haught's
the strongest deputy I've ever had.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.047
Look, I know
that you two are, um...

17:30.216 --> 17:32.378
you're, uh...

17:32.552 --> 17:35.716
But procedure says I had to call
Nicole's next of kin.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.721
But she doesn't speak
to her parents.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.133
Neither did I.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.098
Oh, hey. Hey.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.812
- You're a doctor?
- Actually, yes.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.150
- Uh, and you are?
- I'm Waverly.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.527
How's she doing?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.283
I'm not sure yet.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.535
Oh. Uh, sorry.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.494
I'm not HER doctor.
I'm A doctor. I'm Shae.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.751
Nice to meet you.
Are you a friend of Nicole's?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.456
Sort of.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.166
I'm her wife.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.632
Ewan.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.678
Tell me that wasn't Juan Carlo.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.343
We don't usually
invite outsiders

18:24.520 --> 18:25.886
to our cremation ceremonies.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.599
He might have had trace amounts

18:27.773 --> 18:29.810
of the Widows' poison
in his system.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.021
As did the other three
we just turned to ash.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.107
Oh, wow. This just gets
worse and worse, huh?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.864
- We needed that venom.
- They needed a proper burial.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.650
- For their bravery and service.
- Mmm.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.693
We're all that's left
of the Order.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.407
Bummer.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.661
Well, have a nice bonfire.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.200
There's other things
we can offer.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.164
Oh, really? I highly doubt that.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.671
The baby. The heir to come.
It needs to be kept safe.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.672
We'd be willing
to take the little one in.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.987
- Let us handle that, alright?
- Others are coming for it.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.627
Demons.
People from dangerous cults.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.761
Like the one
you used to work for.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.595
Black Badge is a secret
intelligence organisation.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.247
They may be misguided, but they
are not baby-snatching crazies.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.728
You were taken, weren't you?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.977
The point is,
the child must be protected.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.608
Care about the Earps
all of a sudden?

19:13.778 --> 19:16.361
I care about not
getting cremated any time soon.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.396
We can't beat the Widows.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.816
But there's a chance
you all might be able to,

19:20.993 --> 19:22.404
with the right weapon.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.944
You mean the one
you took from us?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.363
- Negotiated for.
- Right.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.702
Come. It's in the big red truck.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.507
Why are you doing this?

19:40.638 --> 19:42.345
An act of faith.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.757
We could all use some
right about now.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.470
Thanks.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.387
But I'll take my chances
with science.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.643
We're doing everything we can.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.899
Almost.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.989
Why didn't you tell me?

20:04.078 --> 20:06.286
I talked to
the toxicology specialist.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.287
They're still trying
to ID the poison.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.827
You called it in, right?
You were with her when it happened?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.586
Yeah. I found her.

20:15.756 --> 20:19.466
She'd already been bitten or...
something. I don't know.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.052
So how did you guys meet?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.644
Uh... Rock-climbing in Nevada.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.688
Not far from Vegas.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.191
Oh. Oh.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.195
Yeah. We got married in a fever.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.027
Live and a big win
at the slot machines

20:43.200 --> 20:44.736
will do that to you.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.612
But then... things cooled off.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.953
- What's going on?
- She's waking up.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.922
- She needs something stronger.
- Nicole. Can you hear me?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.582
It's burning.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.251
Any known allergies
to anaesthetics?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.545
- No.
- Yes. Thiopental could kill her.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.509
Give her propofol.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.138
Rock-climbing incident.
She needed surgery.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.724
- Kind of ruined our honeymoon.
- Right.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.893
- I didn't know.
- How could you?

21:19.820 --> 21:22.483
Oh, God.
I'm just making this worse.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.491
Black and chunky,
just how he likes it.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.916
There.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.997
There it is.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.957
I trust Doc. Must've been Dolls.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.548
Waverly. Am I the only one
who didn't know?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.257
Did she also tell you
I saved her

21:47.431 --> 21:49.034
from becoming Tucker's
personal Kimmy Schmidt?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.970
She's distracted,

21:51.143 --> 21:53.886
watching the love of her life
die a painful death.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.181
I heard. If there's anything
that I can do...

21:59.652 --> 22:01.109
All set. Vámonos.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.736
Doc. Can you bring the truck
to the front door?

22:03.906 --> 22:05.522
Preggo card.

22:05.699 --> 22:09.033
Every step is like
an adventure in discomfort.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.195
Miracle of life, my ass.

22:11.372 --> 22:15.707
Bar is closed today.
You can take the day off.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.213
Ahem.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.719
So, should I pack my bags now,
or is this it?

22:35.896 --> 22:38.309
- Right here, right now?
- You wanna help?

22:38.482 --> 22:41.600
Haul ass over to BBD.
We got an antivenom needs testing.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.234
You don't think
Jeremy can handle it?

22:43.404 --> 22:45.771
Yeah, I do. He's a scientist.

22:45.948 --> 22:50.409
But he lacks certain skills,
like not dying.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.819
It's a good deal.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.284
When this is done,
Nicole makes it...

22:56.792 --> 22:58.704
I'll shoot you last.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.414
I appreciate everything
you've done.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.300
I even like you.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.256
But...

23:09.430 --> 23:11.638
Nicole needs us.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.969
Yeah. I know. So you don't
have to threaten me.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.679
All you have to do is ask.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.818
Hey.

23:28.991 --> 23:33.110
Thought I'd stop by on my way
to the office. How is she?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.452
- Oh, Dolls.
- Alright. It's OK.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.576
Who's that?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.872
It's just another doctor.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.713
So, did you find the Order?

23:48.886 --> 23:51.754
- Get anything from Juan Carlo?
- Yeah... something, but...

23:53.182 --> 23:55.219
I should probably
get going, though.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.392
Wait. Can I come with?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.474
I'm useless here.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.775
Awesome! OK, this formula
is killing me.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.065
Did they send your big brain
over to help?

24:11.241 --> 24:14.951
Mmm. My body, actually.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.454
- Nobody cares about your body.
- Yeah. I'm starting to get that.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.708
Attempt number one at the antivenom.
Need a test subject.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.584
Wynonna said
she'd figure it out.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.167
I'm not here for the snacks.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.878
- I'm your guinea pig.
- What?

24:29.051 --> 24:31.384
No, no, hey, I know
you're not strictly like us,

24:31.553 --> 24:33.715
but you're one of us
and this stuff could kill you.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.289
You know damn well there's only
one thing that could kill me.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.260
Hey, hey, Rosita, come on.
I'm gonna have to have you stop...

24:39.436 --> 24:42.770
Please. Please. This is not
what I signed up for.

24:42.940 --> 24:47.230
Some of us don't have a choice.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.320
The girls gave Mercedes
a hell of a fight.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.325
Not hellish enough.

24:56.495 --> 25:00.580
I saw 'Peacemaker' on the bar.
Tell you anything?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.661
Just that you've been keeping
a supernaturally

25:02.835 --> 25:05.999
well-endowed secret from me
for a very long time.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.254
I'm sure you can understand why.

25:09.842 --> 25:14.587
I assume she is now 'helping'
to perfect the antivenom?

25:14.763 --> 25:16.800
Do you have a better idea?

25:16.974 --> 25:19.307
She can't die, Doc.
Not from that.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.559
Oh, but she can
still feel the pain.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.095
They all can.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.862
It's too fresh
to have come from Nicole.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.779
I'd say less than an hour.

25:55.846 --> 25:59.305
Calamity Jane, you minx.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.011
I almost sent you to hell, cat.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.017
Nedley forget about you?

26:03.187 --> 26:05.144
Maybe he didn't.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.149
Nicole's hat?

26:10.319 --> 26:12.060
She is barely a seven.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.479
This here's a seven
and three-quarters.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.022
In Wynonna terms.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.738
The owner of this hat
has got a big damn head.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.948
Waverly said Mercedes
was mumbling about

26:21.121 --> 26:23.704
being in the right place,
wrong time.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.957
- Bitch came back, didn't she?
- She's got Nedley.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.171
The rings pointed me to the law.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.553
I was sure it was the other one.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.556
Nicole is close
with the heir, and...

26:41.725 --> 26:45.218
You, though. You're nobody.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.978
I am skip
of the Purgatory Poachers,

26:48.148 --> 26:50.606
county curling champions
for the past six years in a row.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.862
Perhaps they'll bury you
with your trophies.

26:56.031 --> 26:59.524
Now tell me where the seal is
and your death will be quick.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.784
We got no seals here.
We got elk.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.037
We got pronghorn.
We got plenty of loons.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.913
Or I can keep you alive
for weeks

27:06.083 --> 27:08.917
and in the most glorious pain.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.371
That sounds kinda kinky.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.189
Are you sure you're not
the real Mercedes?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.007
Argh!

27:22.015 --> 27:24.758
Would it have killed you
to add morphine to the mixture?

27:24.935 --> 27:26.801
We're getting closer.
We could take a break.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.187
- No, don't! Just... just...
- Jeremy, stop!

27:29.356 --> 27:31.723
Hey. It's not me. Rosie insisted
because Wynonna insisted.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.392
Who I'm not blaming because
someone has to test it,

27:34.570 --> 27:36.851
but this is total bullshit
and makes me feel like horfing.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.439
Yeah, it should.
This is not who we are.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.450
Hey, hey, wait. It's the only way
we have to save Nicole, OK?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.611
- No. It's not. It's not.
- Yes.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.662
Beth-face Widow came to me.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.752
She offered to save Nicole.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.463
As long as I give her
the third seal.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.883
- Did you?
- No. Of course not.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.638
OK. Good.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.494
'Cause that seal's
the only thing preventing

28:06.518 --> 28:08.350
the Widows from
unleashing MegaDemon 3000.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.263
Yeah. Got it. But Nicole's
running out of time.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.181
And if this experiment
isn't working...

28:13.358 --> 28:15.566
- What if you did?
- What?

28:15.736 --> 28:17.648
You'd do anything
for the woman you love, right?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.483
- Dolls?
- So what if you made the deal.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.399
And gave Beth the third seal.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.159
And she actually followed through
and saved Nicole.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.241
When they raise
their dead demon husband,

28:27.414 --> 28:30.407
she would be there to help us
put him back where he belongs.

28:30.584 --> 28:34.453
After everything Wynonna's done
to get that seal, how could I?

28:34.630 --> 28:38.089
You could say I made you.
I ordered you.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.009
- I don't even know where it is.
- And neither do I.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.681
Jeremy. Think outside the box.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.716
- That's what she said.
- That's what she...

28:48.894 --> 28:50.760
Dolls, no. What are you...

28:50.938 --> 28:53.138
What's the point of being different
if you can't use it?

28:53.273 --> 28:56.641
Hook me up.
We got a ginger to save. Let's go.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.810
What the hell's taking
Doc and Wynonna so long?

28:58.987 --> 29:04.153
I should go and see Nicole
one last... one more time.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.158
OK.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.742
Hey. I'll never forget this.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.747
Ready?

29:16.672 --> 29:19.164
Argh!

29:25.055 --> 29:27.217
You can end this.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.883
Tell me where to find the seal
and the pain stops.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.643
So Tucker was just a toady.

29:32.813 --> 29:36.807
What are you?
A witch? A Pokémon?

29:40.320 --> 29:43.279
You think this is
my first demon rodeo?

29:43.448 --> 29:46.407
You know we had
an actual demon rodeo.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.320
Argh! Tell me!

29:50.497 --> 29:52.489
You know, lady, this is a day
at the beach

29:52.666 --> 29:56.159
compared to Wynonna Earp
on my case for eternity

29:56.336 --> 29:57.918
over any beans I spill.

29:58.088 --> 30:01.547
When we raise our lord
and master,

30:01.717 --> 30:06.257
we will sacrifice your pathetic body
at the altar of his tomb.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.592
The only altar this boy bows to

30:08.765 --> 30:11.098
is a barstool
on hockey Saturday.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.930
Where's yours?

30:13.103 --> 30:17.438
In the house of my enemy,
in a place of worship.

30:17.607 --> 30:21.772
And you will lead me
to the seal that opens it.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.739
I tire of this.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.287
Argh!

30:34.374 --> 30:37.242
After, we do the toes.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.082
The iron count
in her blood is too high.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.666
Her organs are shutting down.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.581
There's gotta be something else.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.217
They pumped her
full of deferoxamine,

30:46.386 --> 30:48.469
but she's not responding.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.182
I've got everyone
working on this.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.345
I read her tox screen.
It doesn't even make any sense.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.104
What exactly do you people do?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.688
I tried to keep her
out of danger.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.194
If you thought that'd work,
you don't know her at all.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.980
Right.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.819
Hey.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.906
What we had was fun, it was great,
but it wasn't real.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.117
But you.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.455
She really loves you,
Waverly Earp.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.295
We have to save her.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.001
There's nothing anyone can do.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.791
Unless you have a miracle
up your sleeve.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.210
The doctor told me
that if she wakes up again,

31:29.388 --> 31:31.254
I should say my goodbyes.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.809
I'm not saying goodbye.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.850
Gretta? Gretta.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.935
I'm sorry, this isn't my floor.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.852
- I knew your sister.
- I don't have a sister.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.521
You did. A twin.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.031
Mattie. The Blacksmith.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.944
And I've heard rumours
about you too.

31:54.121 --> 31:57.535
The Iron Witch.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.375
I know who you are.

32:01.545 --> 32:04.333
Don't presume to know me
just because you saw my sister die.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.249
Please. I need your help.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.213
My love, she's...

32:09.386 --> 32:11.628
She's got iron in her veins.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.421
- OK, she was...
- Bitten?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.555
By something not of this world?

32:15.725 --> 32:18.934
- Yeah. A demon.
- Did you see this demon?

32:19.104 --> 32:22.268
A Widow in black that can
levitate and steal faces.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.651
- Not just one.
- You know them?

32:26.820 --> 32:28.982
There was a story
my great-grandmother used to tell.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.489
Two twisted spider sisters.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.115
They'd attack pretty girls.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.992
Ate them whole,
but for their faces.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.619
These, they wear as masks

32:36.788 --> 32:38.508
to lure the girl's
remaining family members,

32:38.582 --> 32:40.164
one by one, to their deaths.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.165
Yeah, well, they're real.

32:42.335 --> 32:45.499
And it's not just my family
they're after.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.581
Your great-grandmother,

32:48.758 --> 32:51.171
did she know how to save
someone who was bitten?

32:51.344 --> 32:53.677
An antivenom?

32:53.847 --> 32:56.681
Maybe. Yes.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.432
Yes, I could get this for you.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.811
- But my price will be steep.
- Whatever it takes.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.688
You make a promise
to an Iron Witch, it's binding.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.851
I get anything I want.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.812
You have my word.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.953
You will find a cure
for what ails your love in here.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.587
Thank you.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.378
Is this a joke?

33:51.947 --> 33:55.281
Doc. Doc's ring.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.407
He never takes this off.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.491
Unless... the Widows
have rings too.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.749
The cure for what ails my love.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.877
The third seal.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.216
OK, well, don't push yourself
too hard, alright?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.427
As soon as we find her toxic ass,
we'll bring her in, OK?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.342
Doc, we gotta speed
this shit up.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.387
Dolls just signed up
for testing.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.353
There are a couple more drops
of blood here. Wynonna?

34:29.525 --> 34:31.313
God, I could use a drink.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.899
Focus, woman.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.984
These branches
are snapped sideways.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.364
They're moving this way.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.277
There's no more footprints.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.946
Well, don't forget,
the freak is a floater.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.992
Well, if she's carrying the sheriff,
she won't get very far.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.498
Looks like it hasn't been
touched in years.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.416
Why is the snow brushed off
the door handle?

34:55.885 --> 34:57.342
If I didn't know any better,

34:57.512 --> 34:59.512
I'd swear you were trying
to get me pregnant again.

34:59.639 --> 35:03.053
My tracking skills
are quite virile.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.928
Save some for the fight.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.062
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.895
What are the chances
you'll sit this one out and allow me?

35:12.068 --> 35:13.980
Somewhere between
'shut up' and 'stick it'.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.770
These harpies,
they killed Juan Carlo,

35:15.947 --> 35:17.529
they put Officer Haught
on her deathbed.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.737
You are not just looking out
for your own life these days.

35:23.580 --> 35:24.946
Noted.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.788
I promise to stay
in the driver's seat.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.328
This is just the beginning.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.795
You have so many places
to slice.

35:36.968 --> 35:41.053
So just tell me.
Where is the seal?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.134
Have you tried up your own ass?

35:48.521 --> 35:51.138
Argh!

35:52.275 --> 35:54.312
She is not coming for you.

35:54.486 --> 35:59.026
Wynonna Earp doesn't
care about anyone but herself.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.159
Argh!

36:08.458 --> 36:12.793
- Give me my seal!
- Give me my Nedley!

36:26.976 --> 36:30.344
- That was for Ms Haught.
- Is she dead yet?

36:30.522 --> 36:34.516
This one's for Waverly.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.777
Nobody tortures
the sheriff but me.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.155
You don't... get to win.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.493
Toy guns, Earp guns.
You already tried 'em all.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.578
It won't kill me.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.617
Who said I was gonna kill you?

36:56.506 --> 36:58.873
Doc, do me a favour
and hogtie this animal.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.713
Do you want a reef knot
or a bowline?

37:01.886 --> 37:04.173
I never broke.
Never told her a thing.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.349
Why do you think I chose you
to hold the ring?

37:08.518 --> 37:11.511
Yeah, it's safe and sound,
in my coffee cup at the station.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.429
You hid it where now?

37:13.606 --> 37:17.270
Oh, everybody knows better than
to touch Randy Nedley's mug.

37:17.444 --> 37:18.980
Yeah, I'm gonna need it back.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.861
- That's probably best.
- Yeah.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.147
Also, I think I need to go
to the hospital.

37:23.324 --> 37:27.409
Hey. You did good.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.830
Jeremy, we got a live one!

37:32.000 --> 37:34.583
Aaah, Clarice. The lambs'll be
screaming for months.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.119
Where's Dolls and Rosita?

37:36.296 --> 37:38.037
Oh, you mean lab rats
number 1 and 2?

37:38.214 --> 37:40.501
Testing took a lot out of them.
Resting in holding cells.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.315
Who's blaming who
can be sorted out later.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.959
- Bit of a time crunch here.
- Oh, yeah.

37:44.137 --> 37:46.754
We will talk about it, Wynonna.
Venom should be in her glands.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.797
To get it out, you'll need this.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.466
- You want me to?
- Are you kidding?

37:50.643 --> 37:53.386
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.657
Waverly, I've got the best news.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.028
Haught, damn, you made it!

38:10.205 --> 38:13.664
OK, just still not 100%,
so maybe less squeezing.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.375
- How?
- Nobody knows.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.161
I-I woke up and I felt
completely fine.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.080
Yeah.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.250
It's a miracle.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.840
It's something.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.843
I told you to wait.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.223
I gave you my word
I'd get a cure and I did.

38:40.276 --> 38:44.145
Waverly... what did you do?

39:11.808 --> 39:15.222
Wow. You look unhappy.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.138
Maybe you didn't love
Nicole Haught after all.

39:18.314 --> 39:22.354
How dare you. You said
you'd point me to the antivenom.

39:22.527 --> 39:26.441
No. I said I could get you
the antivenom.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.402
That was a dirty trick.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.533
Is she not cured?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.241
Wynonna will never forgive me.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.249
- Nicole? Waverly?
- Fine and not fine.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.501
In neck-deep shit
when I find her, actually.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.378
- The cure didn't work?
- I said Nicole's fine.

39:46.384 --> 39:50.003
It's all going down.
The Widows have the third seal.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.513
Waverly did it. She found it?

39:53.683 --> 39:55.219
You knew?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.725
That.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.272
Oh, no, no way.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.519
You told me to name my price.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.404
This is it, Earp.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.442
You make a wish on that thing,
you'll regret it in 10 years.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.576
I'm aware of the cost.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.583
- You'd have done the same thing.
- No.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.839
I would have trusted my people
to find a cure,

40:27.008 --> 40:29.546
which we did,
instead of handing over

40:29.719 --> 40:31.639
an apocalyptic piece
of jewellery to our enemies.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.129
We get ready to fight.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.075
Even 'Peacemaker' can't
put these bitches down.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.965
About that.
I might have something.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.556
I got a frantic text message
from Wynonna, said you ran off.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.849
The Blacksmith?

40:45.026 --> 40:47.689
Her sister, Gretta.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.945
She helped me with something.

40:53.076 --> 40:56.410
'Disappear'. Waverly, why is
she jabbering in German?

40:56.579 --> 40:58.070
I don't know.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.661
- Wynonna Earp.
- Let go of that trophy.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.451
The Order,
they call it a weapon.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.167
The Order needs
to stop talking in riddles.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.960
What kind of metal is this?

41:10.134 --> 41:12.501
I said stop. Now.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.672
I changed my mind, OK?
No deal. No deal.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.464
Hands off that trophy, witch!

41:17.642 --> 41:19.258
No!

41:19.435 --> 41:21.552
What did you do?

41:22.981 --> 41:25.974
Sorry about Holliday.
Chalk it up to collateral damage.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.813
You two Earp girls.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.853
You got my sister killed.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.487
Now this is your punishment.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.070
One will disappear.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.327
The other will
have to live with it.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.489
No. No. No.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.578
Undo it! No!

41:43.751 --> 41:45.617
No! Wynonna.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.957
I know what we need to do.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.667
What the...

41:59.559 --> 42:01.095
Doc? Doc?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.477
Wynonna!

42:05.732 --> 42:07.974
Waves? Are you OK?

42:08.151 --> 42:10.313
Hey, did you hear shrieking?

42:10.486 --> 42:12.819
Yeah, from your mouth, silly.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.072
Who's Wynonna?

42:15.241 --> 42:18.530
Huh. I have no idea.

42:18.703 --> 42:22.287
Hey, c'mon.
We've got a wedding to plan.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.708
Not again.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.627
Wynonna.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.968
Wynonna!
