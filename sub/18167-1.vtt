00:52.746 --> 00:54.989
Paradoxical.

00:56.791 --> 01:00.286
- Bold.
- Yeah.

01:01.671 --> 01:03.490
Mysterious.

01:03.590 --> 01:06.960
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric.

01:07.469 --> 01:10.914
- Private.
- She was a very, very private woman.

01:11.014 --> 01:14.709
I never had any idea
she took pictures.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.796
She would take photographs.
Many, many photographs.

01:17.896 --> 01:20.382
She would never have let this happen.

01:20.482 --> 01:25.011
Is there anything that you wish
you had done differently than...

01:25.111 --> 01:28.715
Sure. I wish I would have found
those negatives instead of you.

01:54.557 --> 01:57.002
Ten dollars... Let's go harder.
Ten bucks.

01:57.102 --> 01:59.421
Then I'll have to end in five.
So can I have...

01:59.521 --> 02:01.673
It was winter 2007.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.301
I'll have to go seven, anyone at seven?
Seven and a half. Ten.

02:04.401 --> 02:05.719
And ten, gotta go $10...

02:05.819 --> 02:08.805
The auction house is across
the street from my home.

02:08.905 --> 02:13.268
I found this box that was
loaded with negatives.

02:13.368 --> 02:15.729
$70. 75 there... $80.

02:15.829 --> 02:20.984
I was writing a history book, and I
needed a lot of historic photos.

02:21.084 --> 02:24.529
And so I would, like, you know, take the
negatives and I'd look up into the light,

02:24.629 --> 02:26.281
and I'd look for images of Chicago.

02:26.381 --> 02:28.116
150, 160...

02:28.216 --> 02:31.461
There were several boxes
that went with the set.

02:32.303 --> 02:33.922
I just went for the biggest one.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.125
39 is your buyer, 39 is your buyer.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.677
I won it for, I think it was $380.

02:40.270 --> 02:43.673
The auction house told
me the photographer,

02:43.773 --> 02:45.391
her name was Vivian Maier.

02:49.279 --> 02:51.723
Google searched her...
nothing at all.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.524
I mean, absolutely nothing.

02:54.701 --> 02:57.228
So I just kind of
gave up for a while.

02:57.328 --> 02:59.105
I looked at some of
the stuff that night,

02:59.205 --> 03:01.691
and it was cool, but nothing
worked for the book,

03:01.791 --> 03:04.027
so I just put it in the closet.

03:04.127 --> 03:07.080
I just had to figure out, what am
I going to do with this stuff?

03:08.048 --> 03:11.292
That's what sparked me
to start scanning it.

03:15.805 --> 03:18.750
I have a reflex, where we'll
be driving somewhere,

03:18.850 --> 03:22.379
and I'll just, like, spot
something from down the road

03:22.479 --> 03:25.223
that I know what it is and
I know that it's valuable.

03:26.066 --> 03:29.010
I grew up doing the flea
markets with my brother.

03:29.110 --> 03:32.230
My father did it. His father did it.

03:32.864 --> 03:35.767
I would do storage
auctions with my brother.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.728
And he'd win some,
and we'd clean 'em out.

03:38.828 --> 03:42.315
We threw out tons of negatives.

03:42.415 --> 03:46.494
Cos there's no value in negatives
to most resale people.

03:48.338 --> 03:51.616
And these negatives that
I discovered, what I saw at first,

03:51.716 --> 03:54.035
I didn't know if it was really good.

03:54.135 --> 03:55.996
I knew that I thought it was good.

03:56.096 --> 03:58.873
I contacted a couple of galleries.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.175
I didn't know where to go.

04:02.519 --> 04:06.097
I made a photo blog and I
put about 200 images up.

04:44.477 --> 04:47.096
I put a link on Flickr.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.230
That post, it just went insane.

05:10.587 --> 05:15.416
So I went on this mission to piece
together the rest of her work.

05:17.427 --> 05:19.662
And then, I found the other
people who bought boxes,

05:19.762 --> 05:21.289
and I bought their boxes.

05:21.389 --> 05:25.593
And then I had all these negatives,
like, insane amounts of negatives.

05:27.228 --> 05:31.933
You always want to know
who is behind the work.

05:33.026 --> 05:35.895
I just knew her name
was Vivian Maier.

05:36.738 --> 05:40.108
Was she a journalist?
Professional photographer?

05:41.826 --> 05:45.822
"Let me just Google her name again
to see if there's anything up."

05:47.707 --> 05:53.454
And I found an obituary that was placed
just a few days before that search.

05:54.631 --> 05:58.626
I found an address in her stuff.

05:59.093 --> 06:02.247
And after some, like,
WhitePages searches,

06:02.347 --> 06:04.841
I called, and I said,

06:06.100 --> 06:10.088
"I have the work...
the negatives of Vivian Maier."

06:10.188 --> 06:12.390
And he was like,
"Oh, that was my nanny."

06:14.651 --> 06:16.269
That was his nanny.

06:18.905 --> 06:21.275
Why is a nanny...

06:22.075 --> 06:24.735
taking all these photos?

06:27.038 --> 06:29.482
What they started
to tell me about her

06:29.582 --> 06:32.076
was... was strange.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.739
He said, "She was kind of a loner.

06:36.839 --> 06:39.117
"She didn't have any
family that we knew of.

06:39.217 --> 06:42.412
"She never had any love life
or children that we knew of.

06:42.512 --> 06:44.255
"But she was like our mother."

06:47.225 --> 06:50.052
So it just caught my curiosity.

06:50.812 --> 06:53.423
So what I said was, "Do you
have any of her stuff?"

06:53.523 --> 06:58.261
And they said, "Well, I've been keeping
up the bills on her storage lockers.

06:58.361 --> 07:01.598
"We wanna throw all the stuff out.
She was a pack rat."

07:01.698 --> 07:02.849
I said, "No, no, no, don't."

07:02.949 --> 07:06.319
He's like, "You don't understand.
She was a pack rat.

07:07.245 --> 07:10.857
"We're gonna get a dumpster.
You're welcome to come and help us.

07:10.957 --> 07:15.328
"If you see anything that you like that
we're gonna throw out, you can have."

07:15.878 --> 07:19.957
I just wanted to go find out
who she was. Just a quick thing.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.710
I found this leather chest.

07:30.810 --> 07:35.340
It was, like, taped shut with just,
like, box tape or something.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.677
And so we cut it and we opened it.

07:39.777 --> 07:45.024
And it was filled to the top
with rolls of undeveloped film.

07:47.035 --> 07:51.364
I took one canister and
I shook it, and it rattled.

07:52.248 --> 07:55.117
So I opened it and there
was teeth inside.

08:01.382 --> 08:07.163
She had stuff wedged and hidden
in everything that she had.

08:07.263 --> 08:12.043
Almost like... it's like a secret little
hiding spot for all of her little things.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.295
A coupon, a note,

08:14.395 --> 08:17.423
a flyer, bus passes, train cards.

08:17.523 --> 08:20.802
Her hats. Shoes.

08:20.902 --> 08:24.597
Her coats, her blouses.

08:24.697 --> 08:27.517
I have uncashed income tax
cheques from the government

08:27.617 --> 08:30.027
amounting to thousands of dollars.

08:43.966 --> 08:45.994
I have around 100,000 negatives.

08:46.094 --> 08:49.372
I have 700 rolls of
undeveloped colour film.

08:49.472 --> 08:53.126
2,000 undeveloped rolls
of black-and-white film.

08:53.226 --> 08:57.805
I realised everything needs to be
organised and scanned and archived.

08:58.564 --> 09:01.718
But it was more than
I could handle myself.

09:01.818 --> 09:05.805
So I thought, "Let's see what
the museums will do to help me.

09:05.905 --> 09:09.317
"Maybe I could get this into MoMA.
Maybe I could get this into Tate Modern."

09:10.410 --> 09:12.603
I sent them... letters.

09:12.703 --> 09:15.114
And here is the reply.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.652
"Dear Mr Maloof,
on behalf of the curators,

09:19.752 --> 09:23.197
"I would like to thank you for thinking of
the Department of Photography at MoMA.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.700
"Unfortunately, the
museum cannot accommodate

09:25.800 --> 09:28.085
"these photographs at this time."

09:28.845 --> 09:31.205
At that point,

09:31.305 --> 09:33.716
I just figured, "I'm on my own.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.671
"I'm gonna try to do an exhibition.

09:38.771 --> 09:41.341
"I'm gonna do a book."

09:41.441 --> 09:43.643
It's an insane amount of work.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.812
I'm kind of compulsive with stuff.

09:48.448 --> 09:51.400
I just wanted people to
see this incredible work.

09:53.870 --> 09:57.698
And I applied for a show at the
Cultural Center in Chicago.

10:06.632 --> 10:12.963
They said this was the biggest turnout
for any artist they had ever had.

10:14.098 --> 10:16.801
And then, the story just took off.

10:22.148 --> 10:24.675
The history of street
photography is being rewritten.

10:24.775 --> 10:26.427
- Vivian Maier.
- Vivian Maier.

10:26.527 --> 10:29.263
- Vivian Maier.
- Saved from obscurity.

10:29.363 --> 10:33.851
In death, she is getting the
fame that she never had in life.

10:33.951 --> 10:37.772
John Maloof is still working his
way through all Maier's negatives.

10:37.872 --> 10:42.118
My mission is to put Vivian
in the history books.

10:46.214 --> 10:48.199
My first impression,
when I saw the work,

10:48.299 --> 10:53.162
was the kind of delight when
a surprise comes your way

10:53.262 --> 10:56.457
and you feel that somebody,
hitherto undiscovered,

10:56.557 --> 11:00.211
suddenly makes their work
available and it looks good.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.673
It looks like there's
an authentic eye

11:03.773 --> 11:06.801
and a real savvy about human nature

11:06.901 --> 11:09.929
and photography, and the street,

11:10.029 --> 11:12.723
and that kind of thing
doesn't happen that often.

11:12.823 --> 11:17.311
I see thousands of pictures. Day after day,
people send me their websites to look at.

11:17.411 --> 11:21.323
And when I flick through them,
I feel most of them are undistinguished.

11:21.707 --> 11:28.072
But Vivian's work instantly had those
qualities of human understanding

11:28.172 --> 11:30.032
and warmth and playfulness,

11:30.132 --> 11:33.669
that I thought,
"This is a genuine shooter."

11:34.804 --> 11:37.089
She had a great eye.

11:38.724 --> 11:41.135
And she... Great sense of framing.

11:41.602 --> 11:45.923
- Here... this is the first one. I can't...
- It's a muddy construction worker's butt.

11:46.023 --> 11:48.142
Oh, my God!

11:49.527 --> 11:51.812
She had a sense of humour.

11:52.488 --> 11:54.899
And a sense of tragedy.

11:57.743 --> 11:59.779
Beautiful.

12:00.162 --> 12:02.615
Those photos of
children are beautiful.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.787
Beautiful sense of light,
environment.

12:08.296 --> 12:09.906
I mean, she had it all.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.750
Was she very prolific?
Did she shoot a lot?

12:13.259 --> 12:16.579
In total, there's probably
about 150,000 negatives.

12:16.679 --> 12:18.664
She shot a lot.

12:18.764 --> 12:21.175
She never showed her work to anybody?

12:23.311 --> 12:26.380
That's what I'm trying to
figure out. So far, no.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.682
I think people would
have loved her work.

12:29.609 --> 12:33.646
I mean, I could even say,
Robert Frank with a square format.

12:34.905 --> 12:37.149
Lisette Model...

12:38.200 --> 12:40.569
Helen Levitt, definitely.

12:41.537 --> 12:43.272
Diane Arbus.

12:43.372 --> 12:45.616
Some of the street portraits.

12:46.751 --> 12:50.162
Had she made herself known, she would
have become a famous photographer.

12:52.131 --> 12:53.866
Something was wrong, something...

12:53.966 --> 12:58.003
There's... there's a piece
of the puzzle missing.

12:58.888 --> 13:01.298
That's beautiful.

13:03.059 --> 13:06.796
I really want to know, why did
Vivian make these images?

13:06.896 --> 13:09.932
What drove her to such compulsion,

13:10.608 --> 13:14.178
to an obsessive degree,
to take so many pictures?

13:14.278 --> 13:16.564
Why were they never shown?

13:17.698 --> 13:21.686
I started to unbox all of her stuff.

13:21.786 --> 13:23.688
I'm finding leads.

13:23.788 --> 13:26.023
You know, receipts
that she had. But...

13:26.123 --> 13:30.570
Her... Her receipts are
from the '70s and '80s.

13:30.670 --> 13:32.613
And in the '70s and '80s in Chicago,

13:32.713 --> 13:34.949
there was no area code.

13:35.049 --> 13:40.079
And I started calling these phone numbers,
attaching every various area code.

13:40.179 --> 13:44.917
773, 312, 708, 847, 630, 815...

13:45.017 --> 13:47.753
Was she ever a nanny for
a San Franciscan family?

13:47.853 --> 13:50.590
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

13:50.690 --> 13:52.933
Yes, she lived right next door.

14:05.204 --> 14:08.198
I know Vivian Maier because
she was my childhood nanny.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.744
For about four years.
Something like that.

14:14.630 --> 14:17.708
Her job was as a
housekeeper and a nanny.

14:19.301 --> 14:21.587
Vivian was my nanny.

14:22.304 --> 14:27.968
Vivian came into our lives when we
needed a caretaker for my mother.

14:28.686 --> 14:31.631
I was just staring at her,
and I had thought,

14:31.731 --> 14:35.768
"Where did my sister find this
lady to baby-sit her kids?"

14:44.076 --> 14:47.647
She was obsessed with just
saving bits of memories,

14:47.747 --> 14:49.690
of moments in time.

14:49.790 --> 14:54.320
The stuff that she collected all helped
me understand her a little better.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.623
I have dozens of audio
tapes that Vivian made.

15:13.647 --> 15:17.893
I have around 150 8mm
and 16mm movies.

15:29.914 --> 15:32.533
I found pictures of Phil Donahue.

15:33.375 --> 15:36.954
Like, in his home,
petting a dog and at dinner.

15:38.088 --> 15:42.118
I was a single parent in Winnetka,
Illinois, with four sons.

15:42.218 --> 15:44.995
Along comes Vivian.

15:45.095 --> 15:47.415
I met her in a diner,
to interview her

15:47.515 --> 15:49.875
for this housekeeper job.

15:49.975 --> 15:52.336
She took my picture.

15:52.436 --> 15:55.005
I was a guy running back
and forth over my shoes.

15:55.105 --> 15:58.426
I had to do a programme
every day, sometimes two.

15:58.526 --> 16:01.137
I didn't want any trouble, I just...

16:01.237 --> 16:03.731
You know, I just wanted clean socks.

16:04.406 --> 16:06.726
She was with us less than a year.

16:06.826 --> 16:09.854
I have a memory of
her taking a picture

16:09.954 --> 16:12.698
inside a garbage can.

16:15.668 --> 16:17.862
I thought, "Well, you know...

16:17.962 --> 16:20.156
"They laughed at Picasso."

16:20.256 --> 16:22.450
I didn't know. I mean,
I didn't give it much thought.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.710
I didn't think she was crazy.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.667
Vivian took self-portraits.

16:31.767 --> 16:35.463
In my mind, I don't know what
image I had of this person,

16:35.563 --> 16:39.349
but it was definitely not
the image that I uncovered.

16:54.290 --> 16:57.318
She came across as unusual.

16:57.418 --> 17:01.155
She wore big... big coats,
with felt hats.

17:01.255 --> 17:06.794
The kind of thing that might
have been popular in 1925.

17:09.137 --> 17:11.582
She was always kind
of hiding her figure.

17:11.682 --> 17:15.544
You know, wearing these heavy clothes.
And these boots.

17:15.644 --> 17:17.512
They used to call her Army Boots.

17:19.522 --> 17:20.883
She was very tall.

17:20.983 --> 17:22.510
Seven feet...

17:22.609 --> 17:25.137
- No! Seven feet!
- She was tall.

17:25.237 --> 17:28.107
- Oh, she must have been about five nine.
- Six foot.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.270
- She liked wearing men's shirts...
- She wore men's shirts.

17:33.370 --> 17:34.988
She said the tailoring was better.

17:36.165 --> 17:39.068
She'd have kind of a...
just a straight blunt cut.

17:39.168 --> 17:42.079
She had hair that stuck straight up!

17:42.713 --> 17:45.241
Now, looking back, I would
say she kind of dressed

17:45.341 --> 17:48.953
like you would expect to
find women factory workers

17:49.053 --> 17:51.672
in the Soviet Union in
the '50s or something.

17:52.973 --> 17:54.633
That's how she walked.

17:57.770 --> 18:00.047
You have to swing your
arms up like this,

18:00.147 --> 18:03.592
and you have to do a...
sort of a Nazi march.

18:03.692 --> 18:07.471
You'd see her on her
little motorised bicycle.

18:07.571 --> 18:09.223
I mean, I remember sometimes thinking

18:09.323 --> 18:13.269
she kind of looked like...
the Wicked Witch of the West.

18:13.369 --> 18:15.696
Always had her camera
around her neck.

18:16.914 --> 18:19.366
Always the camera around her neck.

18:21.543 --> 18:25.948
She had, like, this great camera with...
I remember, it was a square.

18:26.048 --> 18:31.620
Rolleiflex. You flip open the thing and you
look through the viewfinder directly down.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.206
I lusted after a twin-lens Rolly.

18:34.306 --> 18:35.916
And here, she had one.

18:36.016 --> 18:41.346
And I looked at that camera,
and it looked like it was rather old.

18:43.899 --> 18:49.313
You see, the Rolleiflex is
a great disguise camera.

18:50.531 --> 18:55.102
Because it wasn't up here, where she
had to alert somebody on the street

18:55.202 --> 18:56.645
that she was photographing them.

18:56.745 --> 18:58.906
She could be sort of
secretive down here.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.444
The camera was shooting from below.

19:03.544 --> 19:07.956
And it gave her pictures a
kind of towering magnitude.

19:09.383 --> 19:12.995
There's a picture of a guy.
He's just an ordinary street guy.

19:13.095 --> 19:16.832
But he has a power and dignity.

19:16.932 --> 19:21.170
And he's... he's standing there
and he's looking at her.

19:21.270 --> 19:24.924
If you look at his eyeline,
he's looking right into her face.

19:25.024 --> 19:30.229
And she probably looked down and focused
and then looked right up at him.

19:31.113 --> 19:33.982
And he looked at her and
she fired the shutter.

19:35.117 --> 19:39.021
Street photographers
tend to be gregarious

19:39.121 --> 19:41.273
in the sense that they can
go out on the street,

19:41.373 --> 19:44.735
and they're comfortable
being among people,

19:44.835 --> 19:48.262
but they're also a funny
mixture of solitaries

19:48.363 --> 19:51.033
at the same time as being gregarious.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.577
You observe and you
embrace and you take in,

19:53.677 --> 19:57.130
but you stay back and
you try to stay invisible.

19:59.099 --> 20:01.377
She didn't like to
talk about herself.

20:01.477 --> 20:04.505
Some people I meet
and they're very open.

20:04.605 --> 20:08.141
She was not an open person,
she was a closed person.

20:08.776 --> 20:11.387
She lived on the third
floor in our attic,

20:11.487 --> 20:15.975
and one of the first things she asked
me for was please to put in a lock,

20:16.075 --> 20:19.278
so that she could lock
her area securely.

20:20.537 --> 20:22.781
It was a real serious lock.

20:23.457 --> 20:26.159
She was mysterious.

20:26.794 --> 20:31.290
She said don't ever open
this door, to her room.

20:33.842 --> 20:36.745
I think she made friends with
me because she sized me up,

20:36.845 --> 20:40.374
and thought I was strong enough
to lift a bunch of boxes for her.

20:40.474 --> 20:42.718
I broke the springs of my car.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.930
I think that gives you an idea
of how much weight I lifted.

20:47.940 --> 20:51.051
She mentioned that she
brought her life with her,

20:51.151 --> 20:53.762
which meant a number of boxes.

20:53.862 --> 20:56.640
We said, "Sure, no problem."
We had a garage.

20:56.740 --> 21:01.520
There was a porch off of the room,
you know, sort of those sleeping porches.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.781
And it was piled high with boxes.

21:05.207 --> 21:09.036
We put them in our garage,
which, fortunately,

21:11.171 --> 21:12.622
was a two-and-a-half car
garage, for two cars.

21:12.965 --> 21:15.534
- And so we had this..
- It became a two-car garage.

21:15.634 --> 21:18.454
It became... it became a
tight two-car garage.

21:18.554 --> 21:22.249
Of course, we'll never know how much
the boxes were her photographs,

21:22.349 --> 21:24.418
- and how much of the boxes were...
- John knows.

21:24.518 --> 21:28.013
Well, but she had so many boxes.

21:29.648 --> 21:34.094
I'd like to know why you would
hoard all of this great art.

21:34.194 --> 21:36.521
Why would...
why wouldn't you share it?

21:37.239 --> 21:40.025
What's the point of taking
it if no one sees it?

21:40.742 --> 21:42.644
So sad, really.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.646
Really sad.

21:44.746 --> 21:46.815
If you could have just
shown her all the pictures

21:46.915 --> 21:49.485
and held her down in a chair
somewhere so she couldn't...

21:49.585 --> 21:52.204
put tape on her mouth so
she couldn't tell you no.

21:52.796 --> 21:56.833
Obviously, the woman was so creative,
and it must have been galling...

21:57.509 --> 22:00.253
to just, you know, be a maid.

22:01.096 --> 22:04.091
Wash the floors,
making some lunch and dinner,

22:04.850 --> 22:07.094
taking care of kids as a nanny.

22:12.941 --> 22:16.144
Some of the early photos
I have are from 1951.

22:18.530 --> 22:23.693
One of them said on the back,
"The Walkers, Southampton."

22:25.162 --> 22:29.699
I was surprised to see the photographs
of my grandparents' house.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.286
We always called it Tides' End.

22:40.469 --> 22:44.339
It's amazing to see it,
so dilapidated.

22:47.226 --> 22:48.627
This was flowers.

22:48.727 --> 22:51.805
We'd have lunches out
here, and tea, and...

22:52.648 --> 22:54.842
It was wonderful.

22:54.942 --> 22:57.845
Vivian probably spent the summer.

22:57.945 --> 23:00.647
She was probably a
nanny out of New York,

23:01.198 --> 23:04.184
tagging along with a family
and with the children.

23:04.284 --> 23:07.229
In those days, your father
worked in New York,

23:07.329 --> 23:09.439
and came out by train on Friday,

23:09.539 --> 23:11.567
and went back on Sunday.

23:11.667 --> 23:14.653
I don't think that's
changed very much.

23:14.753 --> 23:17.114
If you go to the beach club today,

23:17.214 --> 23:19.825
and, go down on the sand,

23:19.925 --> 23:22.210
you'll see the nannies there.

23:22.970 --> 23:25.080
Some of these women
have been lucky enough

23:25.180 --> 23:27.541
to make their way up here
to the United States.

23:27.641 --> 23:31.678
The girl who helps me, this is
her fifth or sixth year here.

23:32.396 --> 23:35.015
- What's her name?
- Olivia.

23:36.942 --> 23:39.769
Delightful. Delightful person.
I love her dearly.

23:41.697 --> 23:45.017
She speaks very little English,
and I speak very little Spanish.

23:45.117 --> 23:47.486
We get along beautifully.

23:56.336 --> 23:59.364
It's been written about
that she had few friends,

23:59.464 --> 24:03.418
and I consider myself
one of those friends.

24:04.553 --> 24:07.797
I liked her a lot.
She was a terrific person.

24:09.599 --> 24:11.843
1962.

24:12.686 --> 24:16.590
I lived in Highland Park, I had a lot
of small children, I was home a lot.

24:16.690 --> 24:21.136
One of my children was friendly with
one of the boys she took care of.

24:21.236 --> 24:24.514
The children, they were always
at each other's houses,

24:24.614 --> 24:26.058
and she would come by.

24:26.158 --> 24:30.812
We had good conversations with kids
swirling around us ail the time.

24:30.912 --> 24:33.907
I had a very freewheeling,
open household.

24:36.251 --> 24:38.620
There weren't a lot of rules.

24:38.962 --> 24:40.830
You know? Don't get
killed in the street.

24:41.673 --> 24:43.951
She loved the children and
the children loved her.

24:44.051 --> 24:46.378
She was wonderful to the children.

24:49.765 --> 24:54.344
I think, probably loved them as much
as she probably loved anybody.

24:55.729 --> 24:57.839
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

24:57.939 --> 24:59.091
- Apple.
- Apple who?

24:59.191 --> 25:01.935
- Apple knock knock!
- Who's there?

25:02.944 --> 25:05.355
- Apple.
- Knock, knock!

25:05.947 --> 25:07.557
- Who's there?
- Knock, knock.

25:07.657 --> 25:09.493
Knock, knock who?

25:14.447 --> 25:15.391
Oh, God!

25:15.791 --> 25:17.693
Well, gentlemen...

25:17.793 --> 25:22.080
I think she was quite lively, and a
wonderful person in her younger years.

25:22.964 --> 25:24.574
I mean, she must have been a delight.

25:24.674 --> 25:27.703
I can see how they worshipped her,

25:27.803 --> 25:30.706
because she was doing the adventures

25:30.806 --> 25:34.384
that, normally, a parent
would probably not do.

25:35.852 --> 25:38.722
Life was more adventurous
with her around.

25:39.523 --> 25:43.135
She was very opinionated about how
children should spend their time,

25:43.235 --> 25:46.388
and mainly how they should spend
it was out and about with her.

25:46.488 --> 25:50.976
She would load up the stroller with
the baby and her bag, and both kids,

25:51.076 --> 25:53.353
and off they would go on outings.

25:53.453 --> 25:55.105
And they had their routine.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.941
There was a Marshall Field's
in downtown Evanston,

25:58.041 --> 26:00.193
and it had a candy counter
on the first floor.

26:00.293 --> 26:03.788
Well, that was always the first stop,
because there were always free samples.

26:04.756 --> 26:08.668
She would avail herself very
heartily of the free samples.

26:09.261 --> 26:11.121
Meaning, like, dump...

26:11.221 --> 26:14.124
You know, she'd dump the
whole tray of Frango Mints

26:14.224 --> 26:16.426
into her purse and walk away!

26:17.561 --> 26:19.296
We stopped going
there all of a sudden,

26:19.396 --> 26:23.808
but I believe that she was kicked
out of Marshall Field's, permanently.

26:24.401 --> 26:26.762
A really clear memory
is her setting up

26:26.862 --> 26:29.773
to take photos of all
these naked mannequins.

26:30.198 --> 26:34.144
Some of them were headless,
some of them were toppled over a little bit.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.271
There'll be probably an
amazing photograph.

26:36.371 --> 26:38.231
But as a child,
it was taking forever,

26:38.331 --> 26:40.400
standing there on the
corner of the street,

26:40.500 --> 26:44.654
waiting while this weird lady takes pictures
of these naked, headless mannequins.

26:44.754 --> 26:48.367
Then they would go out and they
would look in the alleys for junk,

26:48.467 --> 26:50.410
because that was
what she liked to do.

26:50.510 --> 26:53.789
She would come home with
pieces of metal, old furniture,

26:53.889 --> 26:55.624
and we would look at it.

26:55.724 --> 26:59.419
"Is this art? Is this not art?
What is this? Oh, this could be useful.

26:59.519 --> 27:01.638
"This could come in handy sometime."

27:03.231 --> 27:06.927
My brother Robbie, he was riding
his bike home from school,

27:07.027 --> 27:08.178
and he got hit by a car.

27:08.278 --> 27:12.140
He was sort of laying in the middle of
the street, and an ambulance was coming,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.976
and he... and he says,
and I don't know if this is true,

27:15.076 --> 27:19.114
but he always said that Vivian was taking
pictures of him laying on the ground.

27:21.666 --> 27:23.527
It wasn't, like,
"Oh, Robbie, are you OK?"

27:23.627 --> 27:25.870
It was more just,
"Oh, this is a good photo op!"

27:32.886 --> 27:37.173
My mother drove up and saw
my brother lying in the street.

27:38.558 --> 27:41.428
She said, "Oh! I thought
the dogs got hit."

27:43.271 --> 27:45.465
Vivian was just kind
of above the fray.

27:45.565 --> 27:50.145
And I remember thinking,
"There's Vivian, taking pictures, as usual."

27:53.532 --> 27:58.403
She was aware of what was going on
in politics and society at the time.

28:00.956 --> 28:05.110
She would bring this
cassette recorder...

28:05.210 --> 28:09.664
and she goes to the supermarket,
and she's asking people in line...

28:10.799 --> 28:12.033
- VHi, Carl.
- Hi.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.577
I got you with my machine.

28:13.677 --> 28:17.998
I was wondering if you had anything
to say about all this political scene.

28:18.098 --> 28:20.125
- Well...
- About Nixon and so on.

28:20.225 --> 28:23.378
I think it happened the way it
should for the best of the country.

28:23.478 --> 28:26.173
And maybe it'll be a warning
for future politicians.

28:26.273 --> 28:28.933
That's right. That's right.

28:29.526 --> 28:31.678
But what did you think
of the impeachment?

28:31.778 --> 28:33.263
- Come on!
- Am I on tape?

28:33.363 --> 28:36.099
- Yes, you are. Come on.
- I don't know.

28:36.199 --> 28:38.143
Well, you should have an opinion.

28:38.243 --> 28:41.780
Women are supposed to be
opinionated, I hope. Come on.

28:42.998 --> 28:47.243
There's one movie that she
made that has a note in it.

28:48.795 --> 28:53.366
And it says, "1972,
Chicago murder of mother and baby.

28:53.466 --> 28:56.661
"Market where she found
ad for baby-sitting job

28:56.761 --> 28:59.380
"which had led to
disappearance and death.

29:09.024 --> 29:11.768
Then you see her walking
to the supermarket.

29:14.112 --> 29:17.315
She's walking in the
baby-sitter's footsteps.

29:21.536 --> 29:24.030
You see her walking
to the neighbourhood.

29:24.664 --> 29:28.618
I just wonder if that's
where the crime happened.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.085
She goes to the funeral home.

29:50.106 --> 29:54.010
She's kind of... a journalist
of the era, like a...

29:54.110 --> 29:57.305
But... usually, you do
that to show people.

29:57.405 --> 29:59.349
You know, to show,
"This is what happened."

29:59.449 --> 30:00.733
She just did it.

30:07.540 --> 30:12.078
One day in 1977, I was
driving on Sheridan Road

30:13.546 --> 30:16.116
and someone flagged
me for hitchhiking.

30:16.216 --> 30:18.201
Plenty of people do that.

30:18.301 --> 30:20.545
Turned out to be Vivian Maier.

30:21.304 --> 30:25.041
When I met Vivian, back in 1972,

30:25.141 --> 30:27.544
I was in grad school at Northwestern,

30:27.644 --> 30:29.713
and I worked in the language lab.

30:29.813 --> 30:34.726
And it was not at all unusual for eccentric
people to be coming through the lab.

30:35.694 --> 30:40.223
She was French. She had lost
most of her accent, I would say.

30:40.323 --> 30:46.396
She affected what, at the time, struck
me instantly as a fake French accent.

30:46.496 --> 30:49.065
Some people have said that
she had a fake accent.

30:49.165 --> 30:50.900
No, this is... this is not true.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.537
My degree is in linguistics.
I have a PhD in linguistics.

30:56.589 --> 30:59.584
The truth is, it was a fake accent.

31:01.553 --> 31:06.541
I happened to see the film The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,

31:06.641 --> 31:09.377
and, probably not for nothing,
they were right...

31:09.477 --> 31:11.087
And I have...

31:11.187 --> 31:14.390
There's the lilting
sound of it, you know?

31:14.691 --> 31:18.178
"Uh, I don't really know what you
want me to do, but you have to do it,

31:18.278 --> 31:20.889
"come over later, and then
everything will be OK."

31:20.989 --> 31:23.558
Her voice, it seemed like
it went up and down,

31:23.658 --> 31:26.102
- you know what I'm saying?
- Oh, yes. Ooh!

31:26.202 --> 31:29.981
Her vowels were longer in
duration than French vowels.

31:30.081 --> 31:32.025
I mean, you know, this is the...

31:32.125 --> 31:37.280
I did... My master's, thesis
was on vowel duration in French.

31:37.380 --> 31:39.040
So I had a little bit of background.

31:40.675 --> 31:43.411
I believe it's someone who had
polished their English accent,

31:43.511 --> 31:46.247
having then lost some
of their French accent.

31:46.347 --> 31:49.751
You don't want to see a copy
of my dissertation, so...

31:51.311 --> 31:54.180
- Well...
- No! You don't, really.

31:56.775 --> 31:58.802
I asked her her name.

31:58.902 --> 32:01.221
She kind of paused. I remember that.

32:01.321 --> 32:03.481
And she said, "Call me Smith."

32:04.616 --> 32:07.402
I mean, it was very clear she
didn't want to tell me her name.

32:08.453 --> 32:10.488
I thought, "This is weird."

32:14.209 --> 32:16.903
She had been a customer of ours.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.539
She was a pain in the neck,
to be truthful.

32:20.173 --> 32:23.743
We held things for her
for as long as a year.

32:23.843 --> 32:26.663
We would say, "What's your name?"

32:26.763 --> 32:28.715
"I'm not going to tell you."

32:29.933 --> 32:32.802
"Well, we can't keep
it without a name."

32:33.603 --> 32:37.098
"All right. Miss V Smith."

32:40.401 --> 32:42.637
You know, "Ha-ha-ha, Miss V Smith."

32:42.737 --> 32:46.641
It was patently obvious that
she was not Miss V Smith.

32:46.741 --> 32:49.018
And we'd say, "OK, phone number."

32:49.118 --> 32:50.937
"I don't have a phone."

32:51.037 --> 32:53.982
"Well, how are we going to get in
touch with you if we need to?"

32:54.082 --> 32:55.408
"Well, you won't."

32:59.212 --> 33:02.123
Why was she giving us a fake name?

33:04.634 --> 33:06.878
We didn't think as much about it...

33:07.887 --> 33:09.964
as you are.

33:14.352 --> 33:16.421
Now, she spelled her
name differently.

33:16.521 --> 33:19.640
There's B as in boy Maier.

33:20.108 --> 33:23.219
Every possible combination of
ways you could spell Maier.

33:23.319 --> 33:27.682
M-E-Y-E-R. M-A-I-E-R. M-A-Y-E-R.

33:27.782 --> 33:29.934
We always called her Miss Maier.

33:30.034 --> 33:31.978
Miss Maiers.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.355
She said, "Call me Viv."

33:34.455 --> 33:37.283
You would never have
called this woman Viv.

33:37.876 --> 33:40.528
- Vivian.
- Nobody called her Viv?

33:40.628 --> 33:42.747
No. Vivian.

33:44.132 --> 33:47.210
Why wouldn't you wanna
tell people your real name?

33:48.303 --> 33:53.208
I asked her what she did, and her answer
was another thing I'll never forget.

33:53.308 --> 33:55.251
"I'm sort of a spy."

33:55.351 --> 33:58.338
That's exactly what she said. I can
still see her and hear her saying it.

33:58.438 --> 33:59.764
It was so odd.

34:01.107 --> 34:06.805
I think the only person who says that is
somebody who's definitely not a spy.

34:06.905 --> 34:09.190
Why would you say that?

34:22.837 --> 34:25.248
Maybe she wanted to be somebody else.

34:26.090 --> 34:28.333
A lot of us do that.

34:32.554 --> 34:36.793
If she did not have this
job as a baby-sitter,

34:36.893 --> 34:40.929
her lifestyle would have
been very understandable.

34:42.732 --> 34:46.393
The real question is, why did
she do this kind of work?

34:48.529 --> 34:52.766
Her intelligence and
her views on things,

34:52.867 --> 34:57.188
there was something very precious
to her about keeping them secret.

34:57.288 --> 35:03.236
Vivian may have looked down,
so to speak, on the employers

35:03.336 --> 35:07.290
who were hiring her for this
low-paying kind of work.

35:09.384 --> 35:12.336
She identified with the poor.

35:19.310 --> 35:21.212
I mean, she said she
doesn't go to a doctor,

35:21.312 --> 35:23.047
she doesn't have any
medical insurance,

35:23.147 --> 35:25.466
and I said, "Are you...
are you worried about that?"

35:25.566 --> 35:29.061
And she said, "The poor
are too poor to die."

35:31.239 --> 35:34.809
She told me that when she
first came to New York,

35:34.909 --> 35:38.646
she went to work in
a sewing sweatshop.

35:38.746 --> 35:41.649
She realised one day that
she wanted to do something

35:41.749 --> 35:45.320
where she could be outside and
in the world, out and about,

35:45.420 --> 35:48.247
and see the sun,
so she took up nannying.

35:50.049 --> 35:54.295
She felt that it gave her a
certain amount of freedom.

35:55.763 --> 35:58.499
Somebody else was providing
the shelter for her.

35:58.599 --> 36:03.379
She wasn't having to work so
hard just to make ends meet,

36:03.479 --> 36:07.892
so she had some free time for
her photographic endeavours.

36:16.075 --> 36:17.644
1959.

36:17.744 --> 36:23.316
Vivian told her employer,
"I'm going to travel the world."

36:23.416 --> 36:25.159
"I'll be back in eight months."

36:26.753 --> 36:30.490
She went to Bangkok,
India, Thailand...

36:30.590 --> 36:32.833
Yemen...

36:33.718 --> 36:36.120
All of South America.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.798
She travelled by herself.

36:40.683 --> 36:43.378
Just her and her camera.

36:43.478 --> 36:46.847
There are thousands of photos
from her world travels.

37:20.765 --> 37:25.211
Do you think Vivian would like the
attention that she's getting?

37:25.311 --> 37:27.839
I think she had a very...
I don't know... I don't think so.

37:27.939 --> 37:30.675
I think she was more of
a very private person.

37:30.775 --> 37:33.469
I don't... I think she...
she might have seen this

37:33.569 --> 37:35.938
as... as kind of an
intrusion, you know?

37:39.492 --> 37:46.232
I can't help but to feel a
little uncomfortable or guilty

37:46.332 --> 37:53.080
exposing the work of a person
who did not want to be exposed.

37:54.841 --> 37:57.126
She was so secretive.

37:57.468 --> 38:00.038
I think that she would like
her artwork to be honoured,

38:00.138 --> 38:03.291
but I don't think she personally would
have liked being in the limelight.

38:03.391 --> 38:05.551
I don't.

38:05.977 --> 38:08.504
She would never have let this happen,

38:08.604 --> 38:10.882
had she known about it.

38:10.982 --> 38:12.383
No, she never would have let it.

38:12.483 --> 38:14.685
She... That was her babies.

38:15.528 --> 38:18.356
She wouldn't have put
her babies on display.

38:20.199 --> 38:22.643
But I don't think she took
all those photographs

38:22.743 --> 38:24.395
for them to just dissolve into dust.

38:24.495 --> 38:27.531
I think she took those
photographs to be seen.

38:30.585 --> 38:36.665
I find the mystery of it more
interesting than her work itself.

38:38.092 --> 38:42.797
I'd love to know more
about this person.

38:44.599 --> 38:47.752
And I don't think you can
do that through her work.

38:47.852 --> 38:49.962
So she didn't tell you anything

38:50.062 --> 38:52.507
about where she came from,
her background?

38:52.607 --> 38:55.301
You didn't know anything?
Nobody pried into that?

38:55.401 --> 38:57.812
No. I... I... Not really.

38:58.529 --> 39:02.058
Did you know anything about Vivian?

39:02.158 --> 39:05.236
- Her family, her past?
- No.

39:06.370 --> 39:10.733
It's amazing, isn't it, that you're friendly
with someone for, like, ten years,

39:10.833 --> 39:16.280
and that you don't know anything
more about them than this much?

39:16.380 --> 39:18.407
We always thought she was French.

39:18.507 --> 39:21.244
Now, she's kind of, what... Austrian?

39:21.344 --> 39:26.298
I mean, she's from Als...
from Alsace-Lorraine or something?

39:27.475 --> 39:28.876
She's from New York.

39:28.976 --> 39:30.878
From New York? What do
you mean, from New York?

39:30.978 --> 39:33.222
- Well, she was born in New York.
- She was?

39:33.856 --> 39:37.218
- She was born in New York.
- No. Really?

39:37.318 --> 39:40.771
Oh, I thought she was born in Europe.
I thought she was French.

39:41.781 --> 39:44.358
How did she acquire that accent?

39:49.413 --> 39:52.483
So, where's Vivian from?

39:52.583 --> 39:56.370
She's from New York City,
born February 1st of 1926.

39:56.712 --> 39:59.407
Speaking from a
professional standpoint,

39:59.507 --> 40:02.160
compared to what
I've done in the past,

40:02.260 --> 40:06.789
this is ranked up real high
on the list of difficulty.

40:06.889 --> 40:09.876
The families usually
have some consistency

40:09.976 --> 40:12.044
as to where they're located,

40:12.144 --> 40:15.715
I at least have them in public record,
where I can find information about them.

40:15.815 --> 40:19.719
Not like this one.
The whole family is a mystery family.

40:19.819 --> 40:22.346
There's a few things that
we know about Vivian Maier.

40:22.446 --> 40:25.600
One, we know that she was
never married. She was a spinster.

40:25.700 --> 40:29.069
She had no husband,
she had no children.

40:29.870 --> 40:31.689
Her parents are both dead.

40:31.789 --> 40:34.066
Vivian did have a brother,
an older brother.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.402
Clearly, he's probably dead.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.654
All of them seemed to be private.

40:38.754 --> 40:42.033
All of them seemed to want nothing
to do with the rest of their families.

40:42.133 --> 40:46.537
All of them seemed to be disconnected
from the remainder of their family.

40:46.637 --> 40:51.083
She had one aunt, who was to leave
everything to a friend in her will.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.545
Not to family, but to a friend.
And this is the reason why.

40:54.645 --> 40:57.840
She says here, and I'm quoting
directly from her will,

40:57.940 --> 41:01.928
"I make no provision for
any of my relatives,

41:02.028 --> 41:05.264
"for reasons best known to me,

41:05.364 --> 41:09.985
"which I have disclosed to a
few of my intimate friends."

41:10.870 --> 41:13.689
At the time of Alma's death in 1965,

41:13.789 --> 41:17.068
Vivian was obviously alive,
her only niece.

41:17.168 --> 41:21.447
Whatever her hangup was,
it went to her grave with her.

41:21.547 --> 41:25.326
Vivian's father was out of
the picture very early on.

41:25.426 --> 41:29.338
So the census records show that
Vivian's living with her mother.

41:30.973 --> 41:33.626
But I did know that she lived
in France for a while,

41:33.726 --> 41:35.836
and that her mother was from France.

41:35.936 --> 41:38.422
So my guess was that there
was family in France.

41:38.522 --> 41:44.428
Because the thing is, the 1949
photos and the 1959 photos

41:44.528 --> 41:46.639
are the same village.

41:46.739 --> 41:49.108
So I know she was returning
to the same place.

41:49.867 --> 41:52.561
So I started looking up all the
stuff that she had from France,

41:52.661 --> 41:55.106
I started looking at the
photographs of France,

41:55.206 --> 41:57.900
looking at the little towns
and the church steeples,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.320
and how this church steeple looks and
how that one looks in this little village.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.490
And I would go on the internet and
look up little villages in France,

42:04.590 --> 42:05.908
and try to match the steeples.

42:06.008 --> 42:08.577
It's like matching a fingerprint.

42:08.677 --> 42:11.539
I knew I had at least one of
the villages that she was in.

42:11.639 --> 42:13.882
Found.

42:16.060 --> 42:18.421
Saint-Julien and Saint-Bonnet,

42:18.521 --> 42:23.718
in this remote little sheep-herder
village in the French Alps.

42:23.818 --> 42:25.978
Population 250.

42:27.113 --> 42:30.433
She might have been offended
that you found her little town.

42:30.533 --> 42:32.651
That was none of your business.

42:33.452 --> 42:35.863
She might say, "God, oh, God.

42:36.747 --> 42:38.991
"Why did he do that?"

42:40.876 --> 42:44.822
For some reason,
my curiosity is overwhelming

42:44.922 --> 42:47.249
to find out more about Vivian.

42:48.509 --> 42:50.411
I'm uncovering an artist.

42:50.511 --> 42:54.623
If I'm leaving this
giant boulder unturned,

42:54.723 --> 42:57.635
because I don't go here,
it would be a mistake.

44:08.506 --> 44:10.533
- Vivian took this.
- Are you sure?

44:10.633 --> 44:13.877
Yes. 100 per cent.
I have this same print.

44:15.429 --> 44:17.840
Vivian took this picture.
This is her print.

44:19.725 --> 44:21.969
Oui.

44:22.645 --> 44:24.179
He says, "Aren't you happy?"

44:25.022 --> 44:27.383
Her box camera.

44:29.276 --> 44:31.478
I have... I have a similar one.

44:32.279 --> 44:34.857
- No, that's her mum's camera.
- Vivian's mom?

44:47.336 --> 44:48.495
Oh...

44:50.130 --> 44:51.623
- That's Vivian?
- Yes.

44:52.466 --> 44:54.418
Wow.

44:57.346 --> 45:01.375
Another thing I found in
Vivian's stuff was this letter.

45:01.475 --> 45:06.847
It was written in French, and it's talking
about a photography lab in France.

45:17.324 --> 45:19.685
- And you can do... like this.
- Oui.

45:19.785 --> 45:23.030
The letter starts out,
"Dear Mr Simon..."

46:12.504 --> 46:14.248
D'accord.

47:00.427 --> 47:03.622
Previously, we thought
Vivian had no intentions

47:03.722 --> 47:07.084
of having anybody else print
her work or show her work.

47:07.184 --> 47:10.629
This letter proves that
assumption wrong.

47:10.729 --> 47:12.965
Vivian knew she was a
good photographer,

47:13.065 --> 47:15.551
and she knew that these
photographs were good.

47:15.651 --> 47:17.720
She wanted to show them to people.

47:17.820 --> 47:20.598
She may not have had that
happen while she was alive,

47:20.698 --> 47:23.025
but we're doing it now.

47:23.909 --> 47:27.487
I stopped scanning myself,
because I just couldn't keep up with it.

47:32.835 --> 47:36.196
There's a lab in New York with
technicians scanning her work,

47:36.296 --> 47:38.866
Monday through Friday, nine to five,

47:38.966 --> 47:41.793
at a rate of about a
few thousand a week.

47:42.678 --> 47:44.788
I've been developing the
black and white films,

47:44.888 --> 47:47.424
so I have about a couple of
hundred left to develop.

47:50.978 --> 47:53.422
It's a very complicated
and tricky procedure,

47:53.522 --> 47:55.633
because you have to get
the formula correct,

47:55.733 --> 47:59.061
and there's only one
chance to get it right.

48:00.362 --> 48:02.022
It's... it's magical.

48:11.999 --> 48:14.576
We don't know what she
would have printed,

48:15.836 --> 48:18.246
what she would have chosen or edited.

48:20.591 --> 48:25.253
We're seeing work now for the first
time that Vivian never saw herself.

48:27.097 --> 48:31.835
When you contacted me, I wasn't
sure if I wanted to get involved

48:31.935 --> 48:34.638
in a project with posthumous prints.

48:35.439 --> 48:38.342
I just didn't think it would be
the right fit for the gallery.

48:38.442 --> 48:41.053
This is the room where we
store our photographs.

48:41.153 --> 48:44.181
I think there are about between 25
and 30,000 photographs in here.

48:44.281 --> 48:46.684
I mean, it's more than most museums have.

48:46.784 --> 48:50.771
Vivian Maier, we've had
more interest in this work

48:50.871 --> 48:55.409
than perhaps any other photographer
I've ever worked with.

49:02.174 --> 49:05.585
It's a big problem trying to get
her work into institutions.

49:06.678 --> 49:09.373
The problem is that the
art world establishment

49:09.473 --> 49:11.583
still won't recognise Vivian's work.

49:11.683 --> 49:16.588
Museums usually deal with
the final product, the print,

49:16.688 --> 49:19.558
that was made by the artist
in the artist's life.

49:20.859 --> 49:25.981
They don't want to interpret an
artist's work from where they left off.

49:26.824 --> 49:29.727
That's bogus, because Gary Winogrand

49:29.827 --> 49:33.272
had a desk full of rolls of film
that he never developed.

49:33.372 --> 49:35.107
So they're developing 'em.

49:35.207 --> 49:38.444
Eugene Atget's work was
printed after his death,

49:38.544 --> 49:40.863
and then ended up being
acquired by MoMA.

49:40.963 --> 49:44.750
I mean, it's frustrating,
because it's being done and...

49:45.467 --> 49:47.411
but nobody wants to do
it for Vivian's work.

49:47.511 --> 49:49.872
She did print some of her work,

49:49.972 --> 49:54.543
but it... it was largely not
the best edit of her work.

49:54.643 --> 49:57.588
She was a masterful photographer,

49:57.688 --> 50:00.891
but printing was not her thing.

50:02.359 --> 50:06.013
That's common, though. I mean,
Cartier-Bresson hated printing,

50:06.113 --> 50:08.182
and Robert Frank
wasn't a good printer.

50:08.282 --> 50:09.983
But they hire printers.

50:10.993 --> 50:13.153
They hire somebody to print for them.

50:13.620 --> 50:18.108
Good work is good work, and it's
recognised that this is really great art.

50:18.208 --> 50:21.495
I do think her work needs to be
appreciated by... by the world.

50:24.673 --> 50:26.458
These are the new prints.

50:26.967 --> 50:29.661
Cool. Yeah, these are great.
Thank you for showing me.

50:29.761 --> 50:31.830
They're yours.

50:31.930 --> 50:35.959
The only way this work can move forward
is if there's money that is made.

50:36.059 --> 50:38.678
The sale of prints will
be a part of that.

50:43.775 --> 50:49.223
Of course, I wish that I could
give her money, you know...

50:49.323 --> 50:52.734
She's gone. I mean,
there's nothing I can do.

50:54.536 --> 50:56.772
She always had a money problem.

50:56.872 --> 50:59.233
God knows, she probably
could have used the money.

50:59.333 --> 51:01.618
Too bad she wasn't discovered
ten years earlier.

51:11.803 --> 51:13.105
Marble!

51:14.848 --> 51:17.092
Yeah, you two.

51:18.518 --> 51:22.130
Here's the picture.
Miss Maier's right in the corner.

51:22.230 --> 51:24.475
I won't call her Vivian because...

51:24.775 --> 51:27.302
She'd have your guts for garters
if you called her that.

51:27.402 --> 51:31.690
Not Mrs. Not Vivian.
She was Miss Maiers.

51:32.449 --> 51:35.519
She was my governess from
when I was five years old,

51:35.619 --> 51:37.938
up until I was about 11 years old.

51:38.038 --> 51:40.315
I've got in my baby
book the exact date.

51:40.415 --> 51:45.537
It's like March of '67
until about 1974.

51:46.630 --> 51:52.202
Inger and I were best friends, and so I
would spend a lot of time with Miss Maier.

51:52.302 --> 51:56.373
She would take us down to the city,
and we would just walk.

51:56.473 --> 52:00.210
In the worst parts of town,
she'd walk very quickly,

52:00.310 --> 52:03.213
and so my little legs had
to fly to keep up with her.

52:03.313 --> 52:05.640
She would swing her
arm just like this.

52:06.566 --> 52:09.261
And then her stride was just massive.

52:09.361 --> 52:12.097
Inger used to just beg
her to slow down,

52:12.197 --> 52:14.774
and she would just
drag her alongside.

52:15.742 --> 52:17.227
Poor thing.

52:17.327 --> 52:19.771
She'd take pictures of everything.

52:19.871 --> 52:21.948
She would see a subject.

52:22.791 --> 52:24.860
Something that would interest her.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.529
She'd open her camera,

52:27.629 --> 52:29.364
she'd focus it...

52:29.464 --> 52:31.450
These poor, you know, people,

52:31.550 --> 52:34.453
she would literally ask them
to... to, like, pose for her.

52:34.553 --> 52:36.413
She didn't tend to pose people.

52:36.513 --> 52:37.831
She's like, "Stand there, wait."

52:37.931 --> 52:39.583
It was just the way it was.

52:39.683 --> 52:41.752
"Impoverished people. Take picture!"

52:41.852 --> 52:45.180
Or somebody crying, it was just, bam!

52:46.523 --> 52:47.925
They... You know?

52:48.025 --> 52:50.218
Like, "Oh, my God,
what is this woman doing?"

52:50.318 --> 52:53.180
We'd joke about hitting her
over the head with a camera,

52:53.280 --> 52:55.015
because she embarrassed us so much.

52:55.115 --> 52:57.726
It was imposing and rude.

52:57.826 --> 53:01.605
They felt, I'm sure, that they
were being mocked in some way.

53:01.705 --> 53:03.323
I'm surprised she didn't get shot.

53:04.416 --> 53:08.954
My mom put her foot down and wouldn't let
Miss Maier take me into the slum areas.

53:11.256 --> 53:14.534
She loved to read the paper, she liked
it that we took the New York Times,

53:14.634 --> 53:16.119
and she read it every day,

53:16.219 --> 53:21.875
and she always had an eye for the
bizarre, the grotesque, the incongruous.

53:21.975 --> 53:24.803
She wasn't interested
in sweetness and light.

53:29.733 --> 53:35.981
She liked headlines that revealed
the folly of individuals.

53:37.449 --> 53:41.019
Stories that would enable her
to basically say, "I told you so."

53:41.119 --> 53:43.438
"I told you so."

53:43.538 --> 53:47.067
Some man murders his wife and
then gets caught in cold blood,

53:47.167 --> 53:48.443
"I told you so."

53:48.543 --> 53:52.539
I mean, these things that
revealed the folly of humanity.

54:11.817 --> 54:17.230
If you look at her art,
she sees the bizarreness of life,

54:18.031 --> 54:22.610
the incongruity of life, and the
unappealingness of human beings.

54:26.414 --> 54:29.359
There were little things,
all the time,

54:29.459 --> 54:32.571
that she was just plain...

54:32.671 --> 54:36.958
in microscopic ways,
just chipping at me.

54:37.968 --> 54:39.627
All the time.

54:40.428 --> 54:43.373
I would go down,
with my allowance money,

54:43.473 --> 54:45.542
to the crafts store,

54:45.642 --> 54:50.873
and buy myself a thousand little tiny,
you know, like rainbows and...

54:51.273 --> 54:53.516
Glass tchotchkes.

54:54.151 --> 54:57.979
Viv would look at my trove
of tchotchkes and hate it.

54:59.156 --> 55:02.225
She would get a big mop bucket

55:02.325 --> 55:06.104
and she would fill it with hot,
soapy water, yes, and ammonia.

55:06.204 --> 55:09.357
And she would have the
ammonia be such a strength

55:09.457 --> 55:11.359
that you couldn't be near the bucket.

55:11.459 --> 55:13.904
Clearly, to need that much ammonia,

55:14.004 --> 55:17.499
you would surely be cleaning
something very, very dirty.

55:21.136 --> 55:23.380
She would take her arm,

55:24.472 --> 55:27.250
and just swipe all the
tchotchkes into the bucket.

55:27.350 --> 55:31.004
They're crashing and grinding
together, and smashing,

55:31.104 --> 55:33.131
and they're all covered in ammonia...

55:37.152 --> 55:41.848
Me, I sort of just quietly tolerated
whatever was happening to me in my life.

55:41.948 --> 55:43.517
My brother acted out,

55:43.617 --> 55:48.313
and I don't think that she had good
ways of coping with his behaviour.

55:48.413 --> 55:51.316
She, sort of ditched us.

55:51.416 --> 55:54.486
We were all taking a walk together,
and she ducked down an alley

55:54.586 --> 55:56.738
and just disappeared.

55:56.838 --> 55:59.040
The police finally found us.

56:00.675 --> 56:03.328
I think she wanted to scare us.

56:03.428 --> 56:07.582
I remember getting lectured by the police.
"You can't leave your baby-sitter."

56:07.682 --> 56:09.709
And me saying, "No, no!

56:09.809 --> 56:11.845
"My baby-sitter left me!"

56:14.356 --> 56:16.883
There were some accidents...

56:16.983 --> 56:21.221
which I knew weren't accidents,
everybody knew weren't really accidents.

56:21.321 --> 56:23.014
All of a sudden,
there's a kid screaming

56:23.114 --> 56:25.475
in the basement with the door
shut and the lights off.

56:25.575 --> 56:27.602
Yeah. That kind of thing.

56:27.702 --> 56:30.063
She was mean. I don't
know how else to say it.

56:30.163 --> 56:32.524
I don't know, she had,
like, a dark side.

56:32.624 --> 56:34.909
I remember one time she said...

56:36.169 --> 56:39.489
"These men, they'll have
you sit on... on their laps.

56:39.589 --> 56:42.500
"And then you'll feel
something poking you."

56:44.219 --> 56:46.496
And I can't remember the
context of when she said that,

56:46.596 --> 56:50.167
but it just was, she had this,
like, anger in her towards men.

56:50.267 --> 56:52.460
And now, I know exactly
what she was talking about,

56:52.560 --> 56:57.098
but as a kid, I really... I knew what she was
saying was dark, and a little not right.

57:07.367 --> 57:11.396
I've seen her more than once jump
back in fear, you know, from a man.

57:11.496 --> 57:14.149
She said several times
over the several years,

57:14.249 --> 57:16.693
men, all they were out
to do is ruin you,

57:16.793 --> 57:19.321
stay away from them,
be careful of them,

57:19.421 --> 57:22.624
you know, that all they want is sex.

57:23.258 --> 57:26.836
She was always afraid
of being touched.

57:28.346 --> 57:30.290
I remember she was
standing up at this dump,

57:30.390 --> 57:33.043
taking a picture of
some sort of incident.

57:33.143 --> 57:35.545
The man apparently
thought she was falling.

57:35.645 --> 57:39.174
He reached up, and all she saw
was a man reaching for her,

57:39.274 --> 57:41.176
and she decked him.

57:41.276 --> 57:43.595
She thought he was attacking her,

57:43.695 --> 57:45.764
and gave him a concussion,

57:45.864 --> 57:48.066
and sent him to the hospital.

57:49.200 --> 57:52.737
I would bet money that she was...

57:53.538 --> 57:56.691
brutalised in some way,
attacked in some...

57:56.791 --> 57:59.945
I mean, or, you know...
molested, whatever.

58:00.045 --> 58:03.698
I hate to say that, but something
happened to her that was awful.

58:03.798 --> 58:06.918
Because nobody would act,
like, the way she did.

58:07.510 --> 58:10.705
I remember some of the more strong
emotional things, I'm afraid.

58:10.805 --> 58:16.010
It takes... It's harder to
remember some of the other...

58:19.606 --> 58:22.467
I don't know if you want to go
into this, but I will. I will.

58:26.363 --> 58:29.983
I mean, there were things that
happened to me that were not good.

58:31.242 --> 58:33.728
Miss Maier was force-feeding me.

58:35.372 --> 58:38.817
Forcing me to eat,
because I wasn't finishing my plate.

58:38.917 --> 58:42.862
My parents found out,
and my dad got angry, but...

58:42.962 --> 58:46.207
My dad found out
exactly how it was...

58:47.759 --> 58:51.371
She would hold me down,
she would shove the food in my throat,

58:51.471 --> 58:54.591
and then she would choke
me until I would swallow it.

58:55.392 --> 58:58.094
And she would do that
over and over again.

59:02.273 --> 59:04.926
There was very much
of a dark side to her

59:05.026 --> 59:07.437
that I have not gone into.

59:09.948 --> 59:12.350
She would lose it sometimes.

59:12.450 --> 59:16.021
The first time she hit me was
when I was five years old,

59:16.121 --> 59:20.450
because I was trying to
learn to tie my shoelaces.

59:21.251 --> 59:22.861
And I wasn't doing it right.

59:22.961 --> 59:24.946
And she got very frustrated with me,

59:25.046 --> 59:28.616
and so she started slamming my
head into the side of this bookcase.

59:28.716 --> 59:32.912
I mean, she wouldn't hit me in the face,
obviously, I didn't have bruises there,

59:33.012 --> 59:35.498
but she'd grab me by the wrists
and swing me around the room

59:35.598 --> 59:38.835
and slam me into things when she
got really upset about something.

59:38.935 --> 59:43.089
And I was eight years old
before I could break her grip.

59:43.589 --> 59:45.425
After that, she didn't do that again.

59:45.525 --> 59:47.435
I was strong enough.

59:49.404 --> 59:52.357
I mean... she was a brilliant person,

59:53.116 --> 59:55.818
and I think she really cared,
and I think she tried.

59:56.661 --> 59:59.856
And I don't know if any of the others
will ever talk about that, if they...

59:59.956 --> 01:00:01.358
if it ever happened to them.

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:04.452
I don't know, maybe she got
it together. I'm hoping she did.

01:00:10.091 --> 01:00:12.118
I really hate saying
these things about her,

01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:15.455
because I've always felt guilty
about not keeping Viv for longer.

01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:19.876
My husband and I were talking
then about having a foster child.

01:00:19.976 --> 01:00:24.089
Viv said "If you want to take care of
somebody, why don't you take care of me?"

01:00:24.189 --> 01:00:26.974
And then she kind of laughed,
but she meant it.

01:00:27.442 --> 01:00:34.015
I think she really wanted to be brought
in to be a member of our family.

01:00:34.115 --> 01:00:40.571
But that... wasn't really
what I had bargained for.

01:00:46.085 --> 01:00:48.496
So there it is.

01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:55.453
Then this little house...

01:00:55.553 --> 01:00:58.248
Miss Maiers lived upstairs.

01:00:58.348 --> 01:01:01.876
My father did provide a room
for her above his office.

01:01:01.976 --> 01:01:04.963
I only... only had a
chance to see it once.

01:01:05.063 --> 01:01:07.882
Back when I...
I snuck up behind her.

01:01:07.982 --> 01:01:09.634
Cos she kept a padlock on it.

01:01:12.487 --> 01:01:14.689
So, yeah, this is totally different.

01:01:17.492 --> 01:01:19.436
This was the forbidden zone.

01:01:19.536 --> 01:01:21.980
No one was allowed to see
where Miss Maiers lived.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.115
Huh.

01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:28.820
Miss Maier went in there and she left
the door open enough for me to see,

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.365
and the room was literally filled,
floor to ceiling, with newspapers.

01:01:32.465 --> 01:01:34.868
See how the floor is sloped?

01:01:34.968 --> 01:01:38.621
I told my dad, and he said,
"That's why the floor is sagging so much."

01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:42.292
He ended up having to put
a steel post in his office,

01:01:42.392 --> 01:01:44.919
because the floor was sagging
and he didn't know why!

01:01:45.019 --> 01:01:46.721
It was just totally full.

01:01:52.652 --> 01:01:55.521
This floor was Viv's domain.

01:01:56.406 --> 01:02:01.227
It occurred to me that maybe I would need
to go up there when she wasn't home,

01:02:01.327 --> 01:02:03.488
so she grudgingly gave me a key.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.616
And... And so I went in.

01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:10.570
You could tell where
she had been walking,

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:15.783
and it was just this narrow path that
you could just barely traverse like this.

01:02:15.883 --> 01:02:18.244
And where would the bed
have been right here...

01:02:18.344 --> 01:02:21.422
stacks of newspapers,
almost to the ceiling.

01:02:25.018 --> 01:02:28.638
You may think I'm exaggerating.
No. I am not.

01:02:46.914 --> 01:02:51.861
Just stacked. Stacked, stacked,
stacked, stacked, stacked, everywhere.

01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:55.490
High, you know, high stacks of paper.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.243
How she even could
get to the paper...

01:02:58.343 --> 01:03:01.838
I don't even know how much
she even looked at the paper.

01:03:09.604 --> 01:03:13.341
I began to see that she was stacking
newspaper elsewhere in the house.

01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:17.554
In the basement, and in the back,
we have a little back entryway,

01:03:17.654 --> 01:03:20.098
and she would stack
newspaper out there.

01:03:20.198 --> 01:03:24.644
Now, the idea was always that there
were articles she wanted to save,

01:03:24.744 --> 01:03:29.323
for the day when she did get around to
cutting out the parts she wanted to keep.

01:03:30.124 --> 01:03:36.406
I... It concerned me,
but I thought, "Whatever.

01:03:36.506 --> 01:03:38.700
"Whatever."

01:03:42.929 --> 01:03:47.292
I gave her a ride to her
place of employment.

01:03:47.392 --> 01:03:51.254
I looked at her desk,
and piles of stuff there.

01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:57.885
She was certain that her employers
were coming into the room she had,

01:03:57.985 --> 01:04:01.347
and going through her items.

01:04:01.447 --> 01:04:05.977
She would rig the books
and so forth on her desk,

01:04:06.077 --> 01:04:10.273
so that if they were
moved half an inch,

01:04:10.373 --> 01:04:12.775
she would know that
when she got back,

01:04:12.875 --> 01:04:15.236
or so, that was Vivian's story.

01:04:15.336 --> 01:04:20.825
And she was also certain that people
were looking through binoculars

01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:24.629
and could see through
the window of her room.

01:04:26.806 --> 01:04:29.250
She was progressively getting
more and more reclusive,

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:30.460
more and more of a hoarder.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.378
Everybody was saying, resoundingly,

01:04:32.478 --> 01:04:34.881
"Oh, my God, you've got
to get rid of your nanny."

01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:38.134
I don't think that Mom
and Dad really realised

01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:43.014
the extent to which she was
living with mental illness,

01:04:43.114 --> 01:04:44.682
cos she was.

01:04:44.782 --> 01:04:47.234
She was. She was. She...

01:04:47.994 --> 01:04:50.237
She...

01:04:53.249 --> 01:04:55.910
Yeah. It was...
it was a little past eccentric.

01:04:56.794 --> 01:04:59.947
My neighbour said, "I'm painting the
bathroom, do you have newspaper?"

01:05:00.047 --> 01:05:02.950
I said, "Sure!" There was a huge
stack right by the back door.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:05.870
I gave him a big chunk like this,
I said, "Sure, go ahead."

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:10.541
Well, when Viv came home, she saw
that that stack of newspaper

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:13.211
was shorter by three feet,
or two feet or whatever,

01:05:13.311 --> 01:05:16.422
and she was angry and horrified.

01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:19.725
"Who took my papers?
Who took my papers?"

01:05:21.152 --> 01:05:24.263
And she just went berserk.
I mean, she went crazy.

01:05:24.363 --> 01:05:28.059
She was... I remember an outside
scene with screaming and yelling,

01:05:28.159 --> 01:05:31.062
where she's yelling at this guy,
telling him to bring them back,

01:05:31.162 --> 01:05:33.606
but some already had paint
on them, or were ripped.

01:05:33.706 --> 01:05:37.151
"Now they're all covered with paint!
Now I can't use those papers!

01:05:37.251 --> 01:05:41.080
"They're covered with paint now.
How could you give him my papers?"

01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:46.077
So I said... I just said, "Viv, those aren't
your papers. Those are my papers.

01:05:46.177 --> 01:05:48.746
"And there are too many
papers in this house!"

01:05:48.846 --> 01:05:53.459
I remember my parents telling me,
"Viv's not gonna be with us any more.

01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:56.178
"She's gotten too crazy."

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.215
Like, not that she
wasn't already crazy,

01:05:59.315 --> 01:06:03.261
but that the craziness has increased to
a level that we can't tolerate any more.

01:06:03.361 --> 01:06:06.397
I remember so clearly having
to say to her, "Viv...

01:06:08.241 --> 01:06:10.727
"I think you're going to have
to look for another job."

01:06:10.827 --> 01:06:12.812
How hard it was to say that to her.

01:06:12.912 --> 01:06:16.774
But you know what? I don't
think she was even surprised.

01:06:16.874 --> 01:06:20.278
She looked back at me, and
she said, "Do you?" she said.

01:06:20.378 --> 01:06:22.621
"Do you?" she said. "Well...

01:06:23.464 --> 01:06:27.452
"then, what I want is
two months' notice,

01:06:27.552 --> 01:06:30.663
"and two months' pay,"
or something like that.

01:06:30.763 --> 01:06:33.124
She gave me her sort of...
what she wanted,

01:06:33.224 --> 01:06:36.627
as if she had it on the tip of her
tongue and she'd figured it out.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:38.880
And I didn't know whether
that was because

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.215
she had been dismissed from
positions often enough

01:06:41.315 --> 01:06:44.427
that she knew what to say,

01:06:44.527 --> 01:06:47.897
or whether she had,
in a way, anticipated it.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.185
My husband and I and our
children, after she was gone,

01:06:52.285 --> 01:06:55.521
do you know, we just jumped in the
car and drove up to Michigan,

01:06:55.621 --> 01:06:57.356
which is something
we never used to do,

01:06:57.456 --> 01:07:01.368
just because it was a huge emotional
thing, not to have her...

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:05.698
See, I'm still weeping about it,
because I really cared about Viv.

01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:09.410
And I think she cared about us,
and it was just one of those things,

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:14.924
where she was a person
who didn't fit in very well.

01:07:16.058 --> 01:07:19.253
She just had those
edges that couldn't...

01:07:19.353 --> 01:07:22.215
And I think we...
Well, I flatter myself,

01:07:22.315 --> 01:07:25.676
I think we were one of
the most sympathetic,

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:29.055
accepting and congenial
families that she worked with.

01:07:29.155 --> 01:07:31.724
I don't know that.
I think it may be true.

01:07:31.824 --> 01:07:34.902
And we couldn't make it work.

01:07:40.291 --> 01:07:46.030
In 1996, we were getting my
mother's house ready for sale,

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:51.244
and when I told Vivian, I said, "You can
stay here for a couple of months.

01:07:51.344 --> 01:07:54.622
"I won't put it on the market yet,
you know, we have to get things ready,

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:58.676
"and, you know, I'm not...
I'm not kicking you out, you can stay."

01:07:59.518 --> 01:08:02.922
Vivian was to be there,
you know, and to show it,

01:08:03.022 --> 01:08:05.633
but she was not at all helpful
with the real estate people.

01:08:05.733 --> 01:08:07.760
She just didn't want to let them in.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.964
They were calling me, saying she
won't let them show the house...

01:08:12.364 --> 01:08:15.852
You know, "We've gotta...
You've gotta do something, Judy."

01:08:15.952 --> 01:08:19.572
So I would call her and say, "Vivian,
you have to let people see the house."

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.777
They did manage to get in,
and they did manage to sell.

01:08:24.877 --> 01:08:28.205
I think we closed the
last day of the year.

01:08:32.051 --> 01:08:35.955
The lawyer called and said, "Judy,
we're just afraid she's not gonna be out."

01:08:36.055 --> 01:08:38.756
And I said, "She'll be out.
Don't worry. She will be out."

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.734
The last time I saw her,

01:09:05.835 --> 01:09:08.370
I'm still unhappy about.

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:13.375
It must have been, like...
probably 2000.

01:09:14.218 --> 01:09:17.622
I was in Wilmette, going to the beach
with my daughter and her children

01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:19.790
and four other children
of her friends.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.669
It was a hot summer day, like,
August, like, 100-degree day.

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:26.756
And all of a sudden, we see this
woman walking down the street.

01:09:26.856 --> 01:09:29.300
And immediately, we were like,
"There's Vivian."

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.602
I hadn't seen her in 30 years.

01:09:32.611 --> 01:09:35.272
But we recognised each other at once.

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:39.769
And we both... "Oh, hi,
how are you, Vivian?"

01:09:39.868 --> 01:09:43.022
and, "How are you, Carole?"
and "It's been so long."

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:45.608
We were like, "We'll, it was great,
you know, to see you,"

01:09:45.707 --> 01:09:48.109
and, er, we said, "We have...
we have to get going."

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:49.987
And she was like,
"Please don't leave."

01:09:50.087 --> 01:09:52.323
She was like, "Carole!"
That's my mother's name.

01:09:52.423 --> 01:09:54.625
"Carole, please don't leave."

01:09:55.134 --> 01:09:57.078
And you're with a bunch of kids,

01:09:57.178 --> 01:09:59.914
and they're swirling around you,
and they want to go to the beach.

01:10:00.014 --> 01:10:02.667
It's a hot summer day, you know.
You're, like, stuck.

01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:06.045
And she kept saying "Talk to
me, let's talk, let's talk."

01:10:06.145 --> 01:10:09.674
And I kept saying, "I can't do it, Vivian.
I have to go, I have to go."

01:10:09.774 --> 01:10:13.102
She kept saying, "But you're
my friend, you're my friend."

01:10:14.737 --> 01:10:16.555
And...

01:10:16.655 --> 01:10:18.683
I dropped the ball.

01:10:18.783 --> 01:10:21.769
That's all I can say.
I feel badly about it.

01:10:21.869 --> 01:10:27.116
And the, er... despair in her
voice about seeing a friend...

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.744
And I feel that I let her down.

01:10:31.587 --> 01:10:33.656
So I proceeded to go to
the beach with the kids.

01:10:33.756 --> 01:10:36.367
I said, "Follow us," but she
didn't wanna do that, so...

01:10:36.467 --> 01:10:39.128
that was the end of that one.

01:10:39.762 --> 01:10:43.624
I do remember once she wouldn't
tell me where we were going.

01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:45.801
"I don't want to tell you.
It's a surprise."

01:10:46.811 --> 01:10:49.054
She took me to the stock yards.

01:10:51.398 --> 01:10:54.635
It didn't come into my
consciousness that,

01:10:54.735 --> 01:10:57.604
"Oh, this is where they
go to kill the animals."

01:10:59.573 --> 01:11:02.735
There was a, trailer full of sheep.

01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:08.816
I do remember guys poking
at them with sticks

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:11.410
to get them out down this long ramp.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.156
After they were done
offloading the sheep,

01:11:15.256 --> 01:11:17.916
they started throwing
out a dead sheep.

01:11:18.759 --> 01:11:20.794
The one that got trampled.

01:11:22.429 --> 01:11:24.798
That was the first
time I ever saw death.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.804
Looking back, thinking about it,
it didn't bother me.

01:11:31.605 --> 01:11:34.600
It was just kind of odd,
I couldn't understand it.

01:11:37.361 --> 01:11:41.015
I've always been a critter person,
and these are my guys, the sheep.

01:11:45.828 --> 01:11:49.774
The end of her life was something that
I worried about when she worked for me.

01:11:49.874 --> 01:11:52.902
I thought, "How can
this end for her?"

01:11:53.002 --> 01:11:54.612
I don't think it had a happy ending.

01:11:54.712 --> 01:11:58.199
I was very glad that these men that she
took care of when they were little kids

01:11:58.299 --> 01:12:00.618
kind of came to her rescue.

01:12:00.718 --> 01:12:05.381
They got her an apartment
and paid for her rent.

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:16.383
- Do you... do you live in the area?
- Yes.

01:12:16.483 --> 01:12:19.720
Do you remember a woman who
used to sit on this bench a lot,

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.680
wearing a big floppy hat?

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.849
Was she the French lady?

01:12:23.949 --> 01:12:25.476
Yeah, I remember her.

01:12:25.576 --> 01:12:30.239
People who still, live around here,
yeah, we remember her.

01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:34.451
She was here a lot,
sitting on the bench.

01:12:35.169 --> 01:12:37.830
But I don't think anybody
really talked to her.

01:12:38.297 --> 01:12:40.908
There's a lot of eccentric
people around here,

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:43.168
and I just thought
she was one of them.

01:12:44.053 --> 01:12:46.088
You knew that, just leave her alone.

01:12:48.724 --> 01:12:50.835
Sometimes she'd be at the dumpsters.

01:12:50.935 --> 01:12:54.004
You'd ask her, you know, "Do you
need help?" or "Do you need food?"

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:56.932
And she would just kind
of yell at you in French.

01:12:57.816 --> 01:12:59.260
How'd you know her?

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.178
Just from seeing her
in the neighbourhood.

01:13:01.278 --> 01:13:04.056
- And you'd sit with her?
- Well, I'd always sit on her bench,

01:13:04.156 --> 01:13:08.018
and she'd sit there, and it took weeks
or months before she'd even speak to me.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:11.063
I was there in the alley all the time,
going through the garbage,

01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:14.150
so I had a bunch of old clothes, and
I had a wool hat, one time, I gave her.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.987
And she took it, she said, "Oh, that's great,
I'll wear that when I sleep."

01:13:18.087 --> 01:13:20.114
She was very short with people.

01:13:20.214 --> 01:13:23.367
She was funny, though. Nice lady.

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:26.495
When I was riding my bike,
sometimes I'd cross her path.

01:13:26.595 --> 01:13:29.874
And she'd yell to me,
"Get a bell! Get a bell!"

01:13:29.974 --> 01:13:32.835
And sometimes, I'd be out
in the alley in the winter,

01:13:32.935 --> 01:13:37.590
and she'd see me without a hat,
and she'd yell, "Get a hat! Get a hat!"

01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:40.176
- She was about that bell on the bike.
- Yes.

01:13:40.276 --> 01:13:43.262
Well, who would have known that
she was actually a great artist,

01:13:43.362 --> 01:13:45.055
and she'd come to dumpster diving?

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:47.808
- That's the sad...
- I mean, sitting on the park bench,

01:13:47.908 --> 01:13:50.728
literally, she'd go across the street,
she'd get a can of food...

01:13:50.828 --> 01:13:54.231
What did she have one day? It was,
like, corned beef hash or something.

01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:57.693
I remember, right out of the can,
not even warm it up, with a spoon.

01:13:57.793 --> 01:13:59.796
And said it was delicious.

01:14:03.549 --> 01:14:06.335
She was much more
damaged than I thought.

01:14:07.928 --> 01:14:11.798
And I have a lot more
empathy for her...

01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:20.724
I just think...
What a lonely lady.

01:14:22.234 --> 01:14:24.561
You know? Incredibly lonely.

01:14:25.654 --> 01:14:28.482
And misunderstood.

01:14:30.367 --> 01:14:33.395
So... Yeah, I think... I mean,
now, if I were to see her today,

01:14:33.495 --> 01:14:36.615
after this, I wouldn't be
as hard on her, probably.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.905
Somebody called me and said,

01:14:43.005 --> 01:14:46.158
"The old lady in the park,
she fell, she kind of passed out.

01:14:46.258 --> 01:14:48.494
"The ambulance is out there."

01:14:48.594 --> 01:14:51.622
So I went across the street,
and at that point,

01:14:51.722 --> 01:14:54.375
they were loading her onto
the little cart there.

01:14:54.475 --> 01:14:57.670
And she was telling the people,
the paramedics and such,

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.464
that she did not want to go,
she wanted to go home.

01:15:00.564 --> 01:15:03.092
And they said that
she has to go with.

01:15:03.192 --> 01:15:05.928
And she looked at me as if to say,
"Can you do something?"

01:15:06.028 --> 01:15:07.805
But, nothing I could do about it.

01:15:07.905 --> 01:15:11.400
I asked the paramedics,
they said, "No, she has to go."

01:15:14.995 --> 01:15:16.772
And then, but that was it.

01:15:16.872 --> 01:15:19.449
I mean, they put her in the
ambulance and took her away.

01:15:20.334 --> 01:15:22.903
And after the fact, a lot of
people in the neighbourhood said,

01:15:23.003 --> 01:15:25.956
"Whatever happened to the old
lady?" and nobody ever knew.

01:15:51.323 --> 01:15:56.186
You have to try to draw,
from the evidence you have,

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:59.072
some understanding of the individual.

01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:04.278
I think her pictures
show a tenderness,

01:16:04.378 --> 01:16:08.198
instant alertness to human tragedies

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:12.461
and those moments of
generosity and sweetness.

01:16:13.429 --> 01:16:18.592
I see her as an incredibly watchful,
observant, caring person.

01:16:19.435 --> 01:16:24.389
And probably why she was a nanny
was that she had those capacities.

01:16:26.275 --> 01:16:29.853
In 1962, when she took
a lot of the pictures...

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.774
the kids would always
play in the ravines.

01:16:34.992 --> 01:16:37.444
It's the most beautiful
spot in the world.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:44.735
You know, instead of this
straight-edged suburban community,

01:16:44.835 --> 01:16:48.906
you always went there cos you wanted
the kids to have a little touch of nature.

01:16:49.006 --> 01:16:51.742
You know, wild nature.

01:16:51.842 --> 01:16:55.587
There was a patch of wild
strawberries somewhere in there.

01:16:59.558 --> 01:17:03.095
And I think she liked it so much,
that's why they buried her there.

01:17:05.564 --> 01:17:08.934
It's a place that they
remembered she was happy.

01:17:11.069 --> 01:17:13.680
Now, you tell me how
you can live forever.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.183
Come on.

01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:19.728
She might have gotten to the
end of her life and thought,

01:17:19.828 --> 01:17:23.990
"Why didn't I try to get
that work out there?"

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.486
Some people's character prevents them

01:17:27.586 --> 01:17:32.874
from pushing that little bit you
need to push to get the work seen.

01:17:33.592 --> 01:17:36.161
You know, she didn't defend
herself as an artist.

01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:38.547
She just did the work.

01:17:39.264 --> 01:17:41.425
A canon is often established.

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:43.460
And so, when someone comes in,

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.130
there's always the sense that
they're secondary figures.

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:49.258
But I don't feel her as secondary.

01:17:49.358 --> 01:17:55.188
When I look at the pictures,
I always feel something primary.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.938
I think that the work is so good that
it's really winning over a lot of people

01:18:03.038 --> 01:18:06.316
who were...
were dismissive of it previously.

01:18:06.416 --> 01:18:08.535
Where it'll wind up, who knows?

01:18:10.045 --> 01:18:12.364
Much of the art world establishment

01:18:12.464 --> 01:18:14.825
still hasn't accepted
Vivian Maier's work.

01:18:14.925 --> 01:18:19.872
But people don't care. They're not waiting
for that validation from institutions.

01:18:19.972 --> 01:18:23.425
They're claiming Vivian
Maier's work for themselves.

01:18:25.185 --> 01:18:27.387
Her work is now in
galleries in New York.

01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:35.645
It can be seen in LA.

01:18:40.742 --> 01:18:42.853
One in particular that
I bought, which I love,

01:18:42.953 --> 01:18:45.272
there's an abject
poverty in the frame,

01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:48.366
but there's also a happiness
in spite of it all.

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.946
Her work is being seen
around the world.

01:18:53.046 --> 01:18:56.700
London, Germany, Denmark.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.420
They're embracing it,
and they're embracing Vivian Maier.

01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:09.721
Oui, oui, oui.

01:19:42.346 --> 01:19:44.589
Oui, ca c'est sur.

01:19:47.476 --> 01:19:50.128
Maybe this is the best
way of all for her.

01:19:50.228 --> 01:19:53.757
To have it happen after she's died.

01:19:53.857 --> 01:19:55.759
That would probably
make Viv happiest.

01:19:55.859 --> 01:20:00.438
Cos in her own life, the attention, I think
she would have found overwhelming.

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:04.434
Viv was supposed to be
downtrodden, right?

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:06.353
She was, like, a nanny.

01:20:06.453 --> 01:20:10.399
That's not considered to be a pretty
high-ranking position in life.

01:20:10.499 --> 01:20:12.442
Not married.

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:14.953
Not any social life to speak of.

01:20:15.671 --> 01:20:20.117
She didn't have these
measures of status

01:20:20.217 --> 01:20:22.460
that people aspire to.

01:20:23.261 --> 01:20:25.839
But she didn't have to
compromise one bit.

01:20:27.015 --> 01:20:28.750
She did what she wanted.

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:33.388
That's what she taught me, is that she
got the life she wanted. She had it.

01:20:38.026 --> 01:20:41.021
I understand a lot more about her.

01:20:44.157 --> 01:20:50.480
But why was this person so private,

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:55.327
yet so prolific in an artform
that she never shared?

01:20:56.378 --> 01:20:58.405
Who knows?

01:20:58.505 --> 01:21:00.824
She did it so it
wouldn't be forgotten.

01:21:00.924 --> 01:21:03.209
And... and here, it's not forgotten.

01:21:05.095 --> 01:21:06.955
As she was photographing,

01:21:07.055 --> 01:21:11.501
she was seeing just how close you
can come into somebody's space,

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.086
and make a picture of them.

01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:15.589
That tells me a lot about her.

01:21:15.689 --> 01:21:19.593
It tells me that she could go into
a space with a total stranger

01:21:19.693 --> 01:21:23.021
and get them to accommodate
her by being themselves,

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:27.392
and generate this kind of moment,

01:21:27.492 --> 01:21:32.739
you know, where two presences were
actually kind of vibrating together.

01:21:38.044 --> 01:21:40.413
And then she's gone.

01:21:48.346 --> 01:21:51.083
Well, I suppose nothing
is meant to last forever.

01:21:51.183 --> 01:21:54.044
We have to make room for
other people. It's a wheel.

01:21:54.144 --> 01:21:58.223
You get on, you have to go to the end,
and then somebody else takes your place.

01:21:58.273 --> 01:22:02.102
And now I am going to close and
quickly run next door to do my work.
