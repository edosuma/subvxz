00:45.311 --> 00:47.211
A Weekend Cinema
and Hong Film production

00:47.280 --> 00:49.544
Lotte Entertainment presents

01:14.607 --> 01:17.804
And like that,
Eva walks stone-faced,

01:17.877 --> 01:21.813
down the unfamiliar
streets of New York.

01:24.084 --> 01:29.522
With the black-and-white landscape
of the city behind her shoulder

01:29.589 --> 01:31.614
An unforgettable opening scene.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.885
From "Stranger than Paradise"

01:37.497 --> 01:41.831
In a few days, I'll be walking
those streets myself.

01:44.704 --> 01:48.697
Tomorrow will be my last show
before I leave for New York.

01:50.076 --> 01:53.739
I'm sad to leave but tomorrow.

01:53.813 --> 01:56.839
I'll wait for you here
at Midnight F.M.

01:57.917 --> 02:02.320
With the soundtrack
from "Stranger than Paradise"

02:02.388 --> 02:06.882
"l put a spell on you,"
I'll conclude tonight's broadcast

02:08.761 --> 02:12.595
Oh, and for the tickets to
"the Breaking News" premiere.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.896
keep your calls coming in,
all you thriller-lovers!

02:17.437 --> 02:23.000
Talking about the movie reminds
me of the killer's chilling glare

02:24.110 --> 02:27.705
There is a serial killer at large
going after criminals.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.215
I don 't want to see psychos
even in the movies.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.819
...reminds me of the killer's
chilling glare from the movie.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.624
There is a serial killer at large
going after criminals.

02:44.564 --> 02:48.227
I don 't want to see psychos
even in the movies.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.632
I hope you enjoy
the rest of the night.

02:51.704 --> 02:54.002
and that tomorrow will be
another movie-like day.

02:54.073 --> 02:55.734
This is Ko Sun-young
saying goodbye.

02:58.811 --> 03:04.579
MlDNlGHT F.M.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.287
She's here!

03:09.355 --> 03:10.583
Clap, everyone!

03:28.474 --> 03:29.907
Charismatic announcer turned
radio DJ

03:29.976 --> 03:31.944
How fresh she looked!

03:32.011 --> 03:33.911
Those were her good days.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.311
You're right

03:36.616 --> 03:40.814
What's with sudden interest
in studying abroad?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.219
So that I can take your job
when I come back.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.121
I don't think she's kidding.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.819
As if she ever does!

03:51.497 --> 03:54.933
Studying is just an excuse
I need some time off.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.332
Plus, there is
my daughter's operation.

03:56.402 --> 04:01.362
Being a single mom is
definitely not easy.

04:02.141 --> 04:03.665
She'll be fine.

04:07.647 --> 04:11.879
Declared innocent
by lack of evidence

04:11.951 --> 04:17.685
Leaves us all puzzled as to
where there is any justice

04:17.757 --> 04:20.658
Obviously, Judicature has lost it.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.921
Judicature has lost it!

04:22.962 --> 04:26.557
Still makes my hair stand
to think about that time.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.294
Resigns as a news reporter

04:28.368 --> 04:31.132
Come back after 2 years.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.196
I'll put you back in the newsroom.

04:34.907 --> 04:39.810
What's the point when she'll
get kicked out right away?

04:40.580 --> 04:43.811
Somebody is upset about
Sun-young's departure.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.108
Where is Se-yeon?

04:46.185 --> 04:49.120
The new girl can't be
bothered to show her face?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.520
She's been out of reach
since last night.

04:51.591 --> 04:56.927
Old one or the new one alike,
they have no respect for the producer.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.663
I should get going.

05:03.836 --> 05:04.564
Producer Oh.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.573
What are you doing?

05:11.044 --> 05:18.177
I don't feel so generous as to
wish you good luck.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.682
Can we get over this?

05:21.354 --> 05:23.515
You want to make up?

05:23.589 --> 05:26.251
So, you wrote up your own
little playlist and faxed it over?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.486
What fax?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.619
- What's he talking about?
- Forget it!

05:30.897 --> 05:35.596
Don't get your hopes up about
getting your TV job back.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.100
It's not happening.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.503
Where are you going, sir?
What about the show?

05:56.422 --> 06:01.223
Don't you know how busy I am?

06:01.294 --> 06:03.660
I'm not a family babysitter.

06:03.730 --> 06:09.100
Even Jun-young had me pick up
Hye-ji from the airport.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.863
What a handful!

06:10.937 --> 06:13.269
Eun-soo, what are you doing up?

06:15.241 --> 06:17.471
She's still up?!

06:17.543 --> 06:21.479
Your mom is angry
because you're still up.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.678
Share your bed
with your cousin tonight.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.380
What you doing up, honey?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.089
You could miss the flight tomorrow

06:31.157 --> 06:32.590
So go to bed now.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.091
If you agree, tap tap tap.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.894
Once more.

06:39.265 --> 06:40.789
Good girl

06:40.867 --> 06:43.461
From tomorrow, mommy will
spend more time with you

06:43.536 --> 06:44.503
Put your auntie on.

06:46.472 --> 06:50.602
I have to stay up for work.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.735
What the hell?

06:52.812 --> 06:55.610
Can I send in my request by text?

06:55.681 --> 07:00.675
I'm really not in the mood
So, please stop talking nonsense?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.187
Hey, I'm a listener, too!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.655
We started together,
we end it together

07:04.724 --> 07:06.715
I can be an annoying listener

07:07.727 --> 07:09.058
Don't fool around.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.893
Get Eun-soo into bed for me?
I'll check in later.

07:13.966 --> 07:18.665
All right! Don't be a pathetic
crybaby for the last show

07:19.539 --> 07:21.302
Go get it, sis!

07:21.374 --> 07:22.068
Sun-young!

07:23.643 --> 07:24.974
All right. Gotta go.

07:26.546 --> 07:27.171
Come on.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.115
A single tap for no and
three for yes, is it?

07:33.186 --> 07:35.586
Isn't it better
to just text each other?

07:35.655 --> 07:37.680
I don't want her
to forget how to talk

07:38.458 --> 07:40.983
She's putting up with so much...

07:41.060 --> 07:42.925
So many operations.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.691
Will she get a better result
in the States?

07:45.765 --> 07:47.289
She will
I know she will.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.994
Difficulties following the homicide

07:50.069 --> 07:52.299
at the red light district,
the police...

07:52.371 --> 07:54.362
Red light district!
Difficulties!

07:54.440 --> 07:56.601
concentrate on the crackdown

07:56.676 --> 07:59.201
Red light... Red-light District

07:59.278 --> 08:03.442
Are you serious about
going back into TV?

08:03.516 --> 08:05.848
Makes me look like an ass, right?

08:05.918 --> 08:10.048
You actually know that?
and, you're still doing that?

08:14.427 --> 08:15.655
What the heck?

08:15.728 --> 08:17.161
Jesus Christ!

08:17.230 --> 08:18.162
Are you all right?

08:18.731 --> 08:20.562
Is he out of his mind?

08:25.938 --> 08:28.168
Come back here!

08:29.709 --> 08:32.269
Oh, my god!
What's he doing?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.075
- What the! Let me...
- Stay in the car

08:36.948 --> 08:38.883
He's going to kill her!

08:38.951 --> 08:40.679
Out in plain sight...

08:40.753 --> 08:43.688
It scares me to raise a daughter
with a scum like that around.

08:46.192 --> 08:50.686
It's obvious he's stone drunk.
Shall I call the cops?

08:50.763 --> 08:53.994
Forget it. No good can come
out of getting involved.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.294
What the fuck are
you looking at?

08:55.968 --> 08:58.095
We'll get off here.

08:58.671 --> 08:59.660
What a creep!

09:02.542 --> 09:04.134
Pick up the damn phone...

09:05.211 --> 09:07.338
The person you're calling...

09:07.413 --> 09:11.042
You'll be a pain in the ass, too?

09:12.652 --> 09:15.416
Lost your mind?
Call me right away!

09:22.228 --> 09:25.629
Eun-soo, I made this for you.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.360
Promise me you'll
wear it every night?

09:28.834 --> 09:33.271
Good. Now, go to sleep.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.170
I can't. I've got work to do

09:39.245 --> 09:41.475
Go to sleep! Now!

09:57.063 --> 09:59.657
As 7th victim from the recent
serial murder has emerged,

09:59.732 --> 10:03.293
the police have announced
reinforcement of the task force team

10:03.369 --> 10:05.894
This is Jang Seok-hyun
from GCN News.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.671
Anything you want to add?

10:16.749 --> 10:18.410
Looks like they're having fun.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.256
Guess what? Our show could
go down the same road.

10:25.324 --> 10:29.021
Mr. Oh is eager to rebuild
the program from the inside out.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.529
I think he'll get on well
with the new girl

10:31.597 --> 10:32.825
I don't think so...

10:32.898 --> 10:36.129
With you gone,
the ratings will drop.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.329
And by next fall,
we'll get the axe.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.335
You know Deok-tae?
He's tonight's guest.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.039
But, I thought it was someone else.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.641
The 'Travis' guy didn't
answer my calls

10:52.718 --> 10:54.345
Thank god we found
a replacement in time.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.086
Are you crazy?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.023
That man is a stalker!

11:01.093 --> 11:05.291
I think you're overreacting.

11:05.364 --> 11:08.492
He is an avid listener and
the biggest fan of our show.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.795
We still have time.
Find someone else!

11:12.972 --> 11:13.904
You can't be serious.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.019
Hey, where are you going?

11:29.088 --> 11:31.022
That was very bad.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.819
Come and have a seat

11:32.892 --> 11:36.123
Give me your phone

11:37.096 --> 11:38.723
What have you got here?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.031
2424? What are you, a mover?

11:43.969 --> 11:47.769
Is that why you have
those broad shoulders?

11:49.642 --> 11:53.738
She won't be using this
number from tomorrow.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.409
Saved

12:00.119 --> 12:03.452
What do you see in her?
She a mom, you know?

12:04.290 --> 12:10.320
She has... a divine voice.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.292
Real soft up in your ears.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.801
Like a soft tongue?

12:22.975 --> 12:24.306
You're dirty.

12:25.044 --> 12:28.013
I'll give you a shout later.
Go to the bathroom.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.708
Switch off the cell...
Do it now

12:34.186 --> 12:37.314
He is a just fan.
We can't change him now.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.656
Did you see this?

12:41.293 --> 12:44.820
Look at those muscles!

12:44.897 --> 12:47.661
There is only a fine line between
a fan and a stalker.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.634
Let your guard down and
they'll walk all over you

12:51.704 --> 12:56.232
It's your fans that keep
you on your job.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.333
Make sure you get that
to the new girl as well.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.571
The minute you let them
take control, it's over.

13:00.646 --> 13:01.977
Whatever you say!

13:03.449 --> 13:07.476
Totally oblivious of this.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.888
How about coming in
on time for once?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.052
- What a beautiful night!
- Hi!

13:16.128 --> 13:17.789
It's the last show.
You could have come early

13:18.364 --> 13:19.092
Coffee?

13:19.165 --> 13:21.292
...and donuts! Oops!

13:21.367 --> 13:22.299
Go on.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.097
They're fattening

13:24.170 --> 13:25.762
You said I should
put on some weight

13:25.838 --> 13:27.203
Did you check the CDs?

13:27.273 --> 13:28.900
Am I your maid?

13:30.876 --> 13:33.208
- My sweetheart
- Cut it out!

13:33.279 --> 13:35.509
Thank you for this!

13:35.581 --> 13:37.208
It's nothing

13:37.283 --> 13:38.648
Let me see

13:38.717 --> 13:40.412
I'm impressed!

13:41.987 --> 13:46.515
It is quite hard to take in but

13:46.592 --> 13:49.618
it's our dear friend's last show.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.830
In 5 minutes.

15:13.545 --> 15:16.275
What's gotten into him?

15:31.463 --> 15:32.987
Sam?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.201
Sam!

15:39.872 --> 15:40.804
Sam!

15:42.074 --> 15:43.803
Where are you?

15:56.555 --> 15:58.216
You scared me.

15:59.792 --> 16:04.559
You'll wake Eun-soo up
if you scream like that.

16:12.638 --> 16:17.871
I said stop screaming.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.377
Stop!

16:26.852 --> 16:29.685
What do you want?

16:29.755 --> 16:30.983
Shhh...

18:15.828 --> 18:16.556
Eun-soo!

19:44.416 --> 19:48.079
Have you ever had
coffee with an angel?

19:48.153 --> 19:51.714
This program is brought to you

19:51.790 --> 19:54.190
by angels' choice of coffee,
Angel-in-us

19:55.360 --> 20:01.299
3... 2... 1!

20:13.478 --> 20:18.108
Did you have another
movie-like day?

20:18.183 --> 20:22.119
Hi, this is Ko Sun-young
from Midnight F.M.

20:22.988 --> 20:31.418
Tonight will be the precious
last time that I share with you.

20:31.496 --> 20:40.529
I hope the next two hours will
be an unforgettable experience.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.931
Our last...

20:45.110 --> 20:50.309
I never thought I would
ever say these words.

20:50.382 --> 20:53.180
Tonight we're going to
talk about farewells.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.186
There she goes again!
Why bother writing up the script?

20:55.254 --> 20:59.350
If I were to pick the most
beautiful farewells in the movie.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.688
What's wrong with you today?

21:02.761 --> 21:05.059
I would choose last scene
from Casablanca.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.894
I'm a bit of a romantic.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.298
At the foggy Moroccan airport.

21:10.369 --> 21:14.032
two people stand facing each other
unable to speak their mind.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.803
Ilsa boarding the plane and
Rick watching on.

21:19.177 --> 21:23.807
A farewell scene that was
as beautiful as it was heartbreaking.

21:25.484 --> 21:29.614
What would our farewell be like?

21:33.191 --> 21:35.523
It's a text from a listener.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.027
It says

21:37.095 --> 21:42.226
Love that lasts the longest is
love that never returns.

21:43.468 --> 21:47.029
I suppose that parting
could be...

21:47.105 --> 21:50.040
a way to preserve your love forever.

21:50.108 --> 21:53.942
The queen of improvisation!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.044
What is this?

21:59.418 --> 22:01.682
The reason why so many fans
still remember James Dean.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.277
Somerset Maugham
could be because of

22:03.355 --> 22:07.086
his unexpected early farewell

22:07.693 --> 22:11.094
A listener who sent in
the Somerset Maugham quote.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.599
you forgot to give us your name
but thank you.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.100
You could call this the love
theme song of "Casablanca"

22:17.169 --> 22:19.399
'As time goes by'

22:20.072 --> 22:22.597
They won't notice that
this was an accident?

22:22.674 --> 22:24.801
How could they?
When she's that smooth.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.408
Take it easy, relax!

22:28.680 --> 22:31.410
You nervous? Forgetting to
switch off your cell.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.112
It's officially the final show.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.280
Even Ms. Perfect is making mistakes.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.415
I've never seen her make
a mistake since her first broadcast.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.958
It's your fault.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.618
She's low on caffeine.

22:43.895 --> 22:45.419
I could use a cup of coffee.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.590
You heard her! Get some
donuts and cheesecake, too.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.930
People will remember
this show forever

22:50.001 --> 22:52.333
Shall we go together then?
Consider it a date.

22:52.404 --> 22:55.635
Go on. It's still quite early.
I can manage by myself.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.069
I don't like where this is going...

22:59.511 --> 23:02.776
- You said my pot belly...
- I know you want it, too

23:15.260 --> 23:19.594
Hey, sis! Are you trying
to pull tricks on me?

23:25.670 --> 23:30.004
I know you're trying
to loosen me up.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.202
but tonight's show is
really important for me.

23:33.278 --> 23:37.305
Ko Sun-young?
Did you get my fax?

23:38.483 --> 23:39.313
Who is this?

23:39.384 --> 23:42.012
You'll play the songs
as it appears on the list.

23:42.988 --> 23:46.719
Because I'm holding
your family hostage.

23:46.792 --> 23:47.622
What?

23:47.692 --> 23:52.026
Or your sister will die.

23:54.199 --> 23:55.131
What?

24:06.545 --> 24:08.376
A-young, who was that just now?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.880
Listen carefully.

24:09.948 --> 24:15.284
You try to tell anyone about
this situation and I kill them

24:15.353 --> 24:16.285
Hello?

24:17.556 --> 24:18.488
Hello?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.406
Hello? Police?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.340
I can't reach home.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.503
Could you send someone
to look around?

24:42.781 --> 24:44.908
Detective Cho, check this out.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.715
Something is wrong.

24:49.588 --> 24:53.957
Face covered up and bow-like knot
looks like our serial killer's

24:54.025 --> 24:56.892
But he's only been going after
pimps and drug dealers.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.327
Is she one of them?

24:59.531 --> 25:00.759
Who reported this in?

25:00.832 --> 25:04.165
The killer called in to say
he left her body here.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.168
Detectives!

25:08.540 --> 25:10.167
The suspect called himself?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.870
It's the producer from
the radio show.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.778
- I'm Detective Cho.
- Oh Jung-moo.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.908
I'm sorry to have called
you so late.

25:19.985 --> 25:23.477
but the victim's cell phone had
multiple calls from you

26:22.948 --> 26:24.381
Hang in there.

26:25.550 --> 26:26.983
It won't take long.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.685
Who is that kid?

26:38.263 --> 26:42.597
Where is Sun-young's daughter?

27:01.720 --> 27:04.848
She's... in the hospital.

27:05.724 --> 27:10.058
Because... she hurt... her neck.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.962
Those of you still up at this hour
and listening to this show

27:14.032 --> 27:17.968
send in texts to #2112.

27:19.037 --> 27:21.062
'Sun-young,
is this really the end?'

27:21.139 --> 27:23.767
'You already kept me company
through the night'

27:24.843 --> 27:26.572
Hi, Ms Bridget Jones,

27:26.645 --> 27:30.877
it's you guys who kept me company

27:31.549 --> 27:33.983
Tomorrow morning,
tell me the sky is white...

27:34.052 --> 27:35.849
then, I'll reply that
the clouds are black'

27:35.920 --> 27:36.579
It's black.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.022
'Travis'! You quoted from...

27:39.157 --> 27:41.591
- "Les amants du Pont-Neuf"
- "Les amants du Pont-Neuf"

27:44.062 --> 27:50.797
This quote reminds of the
scene where the heroine leaves

27:51.670 --> 27:53.695
And my heart starts to ache.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.798
I feel that I've broken
a promise I made with you

27:56.875 --> 27:58.866
because of personal reasons.

27:58.943 --> 28:01.275
Mr. Ko Joon-young...

28:01.346 --> 28:03.280
- So, you're her brother.
- That's right.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.838
But in the movie, the lovers
are eventually.

28:04.916 --> 28:05.780
But, it's a protocol.

28:06.818 --> 28:10.151
We still have to take a look around.

28:14.826 --> 28:15.758
Well...

28:18.329 --> 28:19.261
If you must.

28:20.932 --> 28:24.060
Pont Neuf is the oldest bridge
in Paris

28:24.135 --> 28:25.432
But its name actually
means a 'new bridge'

28:25.503 --> 28:31.066
Thank you and sorry to be a bother.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.170
What a nice place.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.681
You have upstairs, too?

28:37.749 --> 28:39.979
The radio is a little too loud

28:40.051 --> 28:42.986
I'm already jealous that
she'll get more love.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.630
I missed 3 minutes of the show.

29:03.208 --> 29:07.042
I hope you'll give her just as much

29:09.514 --> 29:11.038
love and attention.

29:17.322 --> 29:18.346
I'm going back up.

29:18.423 --> 29:23.952
The next song is from
Michael Haneke's "Pianist"

29:24.028 --> 29:27.464
another film about obsessive love.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.373
Hey, Sun-young.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.879
I told you not to tell anyone.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.921
Why did you call the police?

29:50.989 --> 29:53.787
Why won't you listen to me?!

29:57.562 --> 30:01.692
Now I'll show you what
the consequences are.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.414
Listen very carefully.

30:25.490 --> 30:29.620
You cannot tell anyone
about this situation

30:29.694 --> 30:32.219
Who are you?
Are you a friend of A-young's?

30:32.297 --> 30:33.321
Stop this sick joke!

30:34.499 --> 30:40.131
Does this look like a joke to you?

30:41.306 --> 30:43.740
Does it?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.445
Look!

30:49.514 --> 30:54.850
I am holding your family hostage.

30:55.620 --> 30:59.647
Where is your daughter anyway?

30:59.724 --> 31:02.090
I only see this kid.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.697
She's in the hospital.
She hurt her neck.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.201
Please...
Why are you doing this?

31:20.678 --> 31:24.512
Hey! I'm telling the truth!

31:28.119 --> 31:29.518
From this moment,

31:29.587 --> 31:32.613
you'll be running the show
according to my instructions

31:32.690 --> 31:34.920
You got my fax, right?

31:35.593 --> 31:38.426
So, you faxed over
your own little playlist?

31:43.001 --> 31:45.834
I put a lot of thoughts into that,
you know

31:45.904 --> 31:47.735
I don't have it with me.
Somebody took it away.

31:52.210 --> 31:55.236
I hope you won't
disappoint me anymore.

31:58.716 --> 32:02.880
Shouldn't we try for
a beautiful ending?

32:04.355 --> 32:07.381
I'll tell you what you
should play next.

32:18.703 --> 32:21.103
July 18, 2005...

32:26.577 --> 32:29.808
Was the first week after you
started the show.

32:30.581 --> 32:32.515
I want the first song
you played that day.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.821
Trouble recalling?
Let me give you a clue.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.221
It's a bit like our relationship.

32:41.492 --> 32:45.519
The main character was a DJ.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.824
Quite a bit actually.

32:48.599 --> 32:51.363
"Play Misty for Me",
"Good Morning Vietnam"

32:51.436 --> 32:53.927
"Fisher King", "Talk to Me"

32:54.405 --> 32:55.337
The list goes on.

33:01.446 --> 33:05.883
You're going to find that song
and play it.

33:05.950 --> 33:09.579
right after this one.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.786
38551

33:16.861 --> 33:18.988
What are you doing here?

33:21.265 --> 33:23.597
Woo-han, when this song
ends play the ads.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.794
What?

33:24.869 --> 33:27.201
Don't play any songs!
Just the ads!

33:30.008 --> 33:30.975
Ko A-young

33:33.378 --> 33:34.402
Look at this

33:38.883 --> 33:40.817
Now, it's all up to your sister.

34:00.338 --> 34:01.669
Are you... okay?

34:36.274 --> 34:36.899
Sun-young!

34:37.574 --> 34:38.599
What’s the matter with you?

34:40.277 --> 34:42.405
Hey, stop it!

34:48.585 --> 34:51.418
What's the matter?

34:52.290 --> 34:54.417
What's this about?

34:54.492 --> 34:55.719
From when?

34:55.793 --> 34:57.317
July 18, 2005!

34:58.196 --> 34:59.629
I must find the first song
I played that day

34:59.697 --> 35:02.165
What the...

35:03.267 --> 35:10.366
It was 'Everybody knows'
from "Pump up the volume"

35:10.441 --> 35:13.672
You know that? From memory?!

35:14.545 --> 35:15.477
It's right...

35:18.649 --> 35:19.911
'Everybody knows'/ "Pump up the volume"

35:19.984 --> 35:21.576
Holy shit! He's right.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.178
This is all you need?

35:27.492 --> 35:30.290
You really are a stalker!

35:31.162 --> 35:32.186
That's creepy.

35:33.598 --> 35:37.796
Find "Pump up the volume"
OST from the database.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.804
Pump up the volume!
P! U! M! P!

35:40.872 --> 35:43.102
It's not on the database.
Try the shelf.

35:43.174 --> 35:46.803
What kind of database is that?
Pathetic!

35:47.778 --> 35:48.802
Found it! Hang on...

35:49.981 --> 35:52.814
Shit! The case is empty

35:53.551 --> 35:55.883
Can you download an MP3
or something?

35:55.953 --> 35:57.818
Are you for real?
We are a radio station

35:57.889 --> 35:59.857
Is it the sound quality?
Listeners won't notice.

35:59.924 --> 36:02.950
Why on earth do we need it anyway?

36:03.027 --> 36:05.154
I don't know, either.

36:05.229 --> 36:08.960
Look up Leonard Cohen discography.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.467
You're right!
It's a Leonard Cohen song.

36:11.536 --> 36:12.366
I'll be right over.

36:13.037 --> 36:15.665
- Excuse me, Mr. Oh.
- Yes.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.971
We haven't notified the family, yet.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.480
Please keep it discreet.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.076
It's track 3

36:26.150 --> 36:28.175
I had to play six public
service ads in a row.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.184
What the matter with her?

36:29.253 --> 36:30.982
She has completely lost it.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.080
What a sure way to screw up.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.990
I'll have to write
a thousand report on this.

36:41.265 --> 36:43.199
Talk about something after this ad
while I get the song ready.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.292
while I get the song ready.

36:57.114 --> 37:03.246
Maybe because it's my last show.

37:05.323 --> 37:08.451
I 'm getting really nervous.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.955
I hope you'll understand

37:14.732 --> 37:16.757
Even if I seem to be
acting a little strange.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.760
Wake up! Wake up!

37:20.738 --> 37:25.573
It's just... really hard
for me today

37:25.643 --> 37:27.167
because I don't want it
to be the end.

37:29.847 --> 37:33.476
Originally, I wanted to
talk about farewell

37:33.551 --> 37:36.281
as the subject of the last show.

37:37.054 --> 37:41.286
But, let me just play the songs
you want like always.

37:44.662 --> 37:47.028
Wake up! Wake up!

37:50.868 --> 37:54.804
My apologies. I must
have been too sentimental.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.505
Up next is 'Everybody knows'
from "Pump up the volume"

37:59.910 --> 38:02.242
Where the hero was a DJ.

38:02.313 --> 38:08.149
A shy teenager, Mark
becomes a DJ at night

38:08.219 --> 38:10.551
and enthralls fellow teenagers.

38:10.621 --> 38:17.754
Through broadcasting
he discovers himself changing.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.760
Here is the song.

38:37.882 --> 38:41.682
We need to talk
What is it?

38:42.520 --> 38:43.680
Is it Mr. Oh?

38:45.456 --> 38:47.390
He won't get off your case?

38:48.859 --> 38:49.985
Excuse me

38:51.962 --> 38:52.986
Well, l...

39:12.717 --> 39:16.244
It aint...

39:16.320 --> 39:17.753
What do you mean?

39:17.822 --> 39:19.346
I dug up the old cue sheet...

39:21.726 --> 39:27.255
I specifically requested the song
you played on July 18, 2005.

39:27.331 --> 39:31.461
And the version you played
wasn't Leonard Cohen's.

39:33.337 --> 39:35.271
It was the Concrete Blonde.

39:35.339 --> 39:37.364
You even said yourself.

39:37.441 --> 39:39.875
that Cohen version
was in the movie

39:39.944 --> 39:42.071
but not on the OST!

39:42.980 --> 39:44.971
You don't even remember
what you said.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.475
I am really disappointed.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.698
Who are you talking to?

40:05.870 --> 40:06.802
Sun-young!

40:10.474 --> 40:12.203
Sun-young!

40:13.077 --> 40:16.103
Open the door!

40:18.783 --> 40:21.013
Look! Ko Sun-young!

40:26.690 --> 40:29.454
If you hang up on me again,

40:29.527 --> 40:31.324
I'll fucking kill them all!

40:32.296 --> 40:34.127
I'll give you one more
chance to make up...

40:34.698 --> 40:36.723
With the next song.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.330
Oh, my god! A-young...

40:44.809 --> 40:46.333
Please... what is it that you want?

40:46.410 --> 40:49.038
Is it money?
I'll give you it to you.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.843
It's not money that I want.

40:54.919 --> 40:57.251
Let's meet up
I'll come over to you.

40:58.923 --> 40:59.890
You'll come here?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.483
How can you be so irresponsible?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.687
This is your last broadcast!

41:04.762 --> 41:09.199
Wasn't it your idea to make
a memorable time with your fans?

41:09.266 --> 41:12.702
And, now... you'll abandon
the show and come here?

41:13.270 --> 41:14.999
Hey... please!
What is this about?

41:15.072 --> 41:18.098
You will not stop the broadcast!
Because, If you do...

41:20.778 --> 41:25.408
It'll be your sister's ankle
not just a toe.

41:25.983 --> 41:32.513
Next is the theme song
from "Taxi Driver"

41:33.891 --> 41:40.729
You must say the exact thing
you said when you.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.423
played that song on Dec 5, 2006.

41:44.301 --> 41:47.327
Come on, Sun-young
You can do this!

41:50.908 --> 41:52.933
You poor little thing.

42:13.264 --> 42:18.201
Do you remember what I said

42:18.269 --> 42:19.793
when we played 'Taxi Driver'?

42:19.870 --> 42:22.896
You're driving me nuts!

42:22.973 --> 42:26.067
Tell me what's going on
so I can help

42:26.143 --> 42:31.513
I'll explain everything later
But now...

42:31.582 --> 42:33.516
You've got to help me out
Please, okay?

42:35.586 --> 42:40.523
Give us at least
some kind of explanation.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.485
Well, the main character Travis
is a taxi driver...

43:14.558 --> 43:17.322
so every night...

43:17.394 --> 43:18.383
No... no!

43:50.527 --> 43:53.291
You said you remember
all my shows.

43:53.597 --> 43:54.325
That's right...

43:55.899 --> 43:57.833
December 5, 2006.

43:58.702 --> 44:00.761
What did I say when l
played the song from "Taxi driver"?

44:03.941 --> 44:06.466
This song is finishing
Shall I play another advert?

44:06.543 --> 44:08.875
Quickly! Think!

44:13.851 --> 44:19.187
Travis, a hero grows...

44:19.256 --> 44:20.780
through suffering

44:21.058 --> 44:24.391
A hero grows through suffering.

44:24.461 --> 44:25.985
I have never heard before

44:26.063 --> 44:30.693
They could no longer put up
with the corrupt world...

44:31.769 --> 44:33.600
So, they had to stand up.

44:34.872 --> 44:35.896
Taxi driver

44:40.778 --> 44:42.507
"HBC Radio"

44:43.480 --> 44:46.711
That was 'Everybody knows'
from "Pump up the volume"

44:47.484 --> 44:49.418
You have to tell me
what the situation is

44:51.689 --> 44:54.624
Stop making prank calls to 911.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.718
By killing the pimps and
rescuing the prostitute, lris,

44:58.195 --> 45:00.459
Travis earns the title of hero.

45:01.432 --> 45:03.263
Was he really a hero?

45:04.334 --> 45:09.271
At time, I said a hero grows
through suffering'

45:10.941 --> 45:14.877
In the movie, Travis is
portrayed as a maladjusted man.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.377
But if you think about it,

45:17.448 --> 45:19.882
all heroes are like that
to a certain extent.

45:19.950 --> 45:23.386
Because they cannot endure
the corruption of society,

45:23.454 --> 45:27.083
so they must act.

45:27.157 --> 45:28.488
Right answer! Clap Clap

45:31.361 --> 45:33.989
Are you out of your mind?

45:34.698 --> 45:36.393
What do you think you're doing!

45:38.368 --> 45:40.700
I said unless the world changes,
we can only wait for heroes to rise

45:40.771 --> 45:44.502
Are you all trying
to finish the show?

45:44.575 --> 45:47.100
Don't shout at me
I'm fed up too

45:47.177 --> 45:49.509
I suddenly remember this

45:50.180 --> 45:53.411
Let's fuck it up and
hand in our resignations!

45:53.484 --> 45:58.615
Someday a real rain will come and
wash all the scum off the streets.

45:58.689 --> 46:00.156
She's already introduced
the next song.

46:00.224 --> 46:04.456
If you have any bitter feelings
you wish to get rid of.

46:05.829 --> 46:10.562
Hope you can wash them away
with this song...

46:21.678 --> 46:24.579
You want to fuck up?
Let's finish it off.

46:24.648 --> 46:29.085
- The music! Change the song!
- Screw you! All of you!

46:46.270 --> 46:50.104
Sun-young... Don't cry.

46:52.676 --> 46:57.409
Do you know where
I've just been?

47:15.032 --> 47:16.556
You were doing so well.

47:18.435 --> 47:20.767
Why are you screwing up now?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.169
It wasn't me.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.574
Your sister is dead because of you.

48:01.812 --> 48:05.646
Shouldn't we work together
for a beautiful ending?

48:08.118 --> 48:10.052
No, then he'll kill her daughter

48:10.120 --> 48:12.850
But we gotta call the cops.

48:12.923 --> 48:15.858
That psycho killed a cop
He's capable of anything.

48:15.926 --> 48:19.555
Exactly! We don't know
if he'll keep his word.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.765
Are you okay?
Who the hell is he?

48:27.838 --> 48:31.171
We saw your phone
He threatened us, too.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.873
Sun-young, check this out.

48:36.446 --> 48:38.880
My sister got killed because of you!

48:38.949 --> 48:42.282
If I only played the right song...
You killed her!

48:42.753 --> 48:45.278
Calm down and check this out.

48:45.756 --> 48:46.688
I don't want to listen to you.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.392
Se-yeon is dead, too.

48:57.467 --> 49:00.334
I just went to identify her body.

49:11.214 --> 49:12.044
What's up?

49:12.115 --> 49:13.446
Hey...

49:14.918 --> 49:16.442
This came in for you.

49:21.625 --> 49:22.853
No name?

49:32.536 --> 49:33.468
What is this?

49:35.572 --> 49:38.973
The police thinks it's connected
to the serial killer.

49:39.042 --> 49:41.670
Maybe he has something
to do with us.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.077
Can you think of anything?

50:19.282 --> 50:20.214
Baby... is that you?

50:23.720 --> 50:26.314
Baby, are you okay?

50:29.092 --> 50:29.820
Eun-soo!

50:31.695 --> 50:35.131
The playroom, you know.

50:35.198 --> 50:37.325
get inside the closet
and stay quiet.

50:38.602 --> 50:40.433
Inside the closet
and stay there, okay?

50:42.639 --> 50:46.131
Mommy will come for you
Hang in there, okay?

51:00.257 --> 51:01.485
What are you doing?

51:01.558 --> 51:02.183
I gotta go.

51:02.259 --> 51:05.194
You should calm down.

51:06.463 --> 51:08.090
Pull yourself together!

51:09.066 --> 51:11.296
Can you get a broadcast van ready?

51:32.389 --> 51:35.222
Leave one phone line open
Put others on hold.

51:35.692 --> 51:37.125
Stay focused!

51:37.194 --> 51:39.128
- You've got the ads?
- Yes, sir!

51:39.196 --> 51:40.823
- Can you give us a hand?
- Relay channel... 3!

51:41.998 --> 51:43.522
Let me take it.

51:43.600 --> 51:48.230
Once you get home,
what will you do?

51:48.939 --> 51:52.431
She's hiding from him in that house.
I can't just wait around.

51:53.810 --> 51:56.040
This is like asking him
to kill you, too.

51:56.513 --> 51:59.346
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

52:00.550 --> 52:02.677
Have the van meet me
at the front.

52:02.752 --> 52:03.377
Hey! Sun-young!

52:11.761 --> 52:12.989
This is too dangerous.

52:44.794 --> 52:45.818
Are you up now?

52:46.263 --> 52:49.630
You've only done
40 minutes of the show.

52:52.602 --> 52:55.036
Doesn't look like you're
in the studio.

52:55.105 --> 52:57.039
- Where are you?
- The restroom

52:57.107 --> 52:58.039
The restroom?

53:02.045 --> 53:03.171
Why are you doing this to me?

53:03.947 --> 53:05.676
What did I ever do to you?

53:05.749 --> 53:10.482
How uncommitted you must've
been all this time?

53:16.359 --> 53:17.986
Just get to the point.

53:18.061 --> 53:19.187
What is it that you want?

53:19.262 --> 53:23.289
I gave you many chances.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.891
What the fuck do you want,
you psychopath!

53:31.174 --> 53:32.300
Shut up!

53:33.176 --> 53:35.508
Of all people, you cannot
insult me like that.

53:36.680 --> 53:42.710
We've still got so much work
to do together.

53:42.786 --> 53:45.914
and you're bailing out?

53:49.092 --> 53:54.724
That's all fine but you gotta
put things right before you go.

53:54.798 --> 53:56.425
Put what right?

53:59.703 --> 54:02.467
Don't worry.
We still have time.

54:02.539 --> 54:06.168
Part 3, when you take calls

54:06.243 --> 54:09.770
that caller will be me.

54:09.846 --> 54:13.179
I hate it when I get
beat off for that.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.981
Whatever you want.

54:17.053 --> 54:18.384
But, don't touch the kids

54:22.459 --> 54:23.391
Kid... s?

54:50.987 --> 54:54.718
Maybe the kids are tired
of playing hide-and-seek.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.526
Maybe she wants to play ball.

54:59.095 --> 55:00.562
Lay a finger on my daughter,

55:00.630 --> 55:02.461
and, I'll kill you myself!

55:04.034 --> 55:05.865
You're a big fat liar.

55:14.544 --> 55:18.776
Eun-soo! Come out, come out
wherever you are!

55:20.150 --> 55:21.276
Hide!

55:22.752 --> 55:24.982
Don't let him find you!

55:41.805 --> 55:44.205
You can get the call sign
through this.

56:26.149 --> 56:29.175
Do you know where
we're going anyway?

56:30.453 --> 56:31.977
Turn left here.

57:08.825 --> 57:10.452
Damn traffic!

57:12.228 --> 57:13.957
Let's get started.

57:14.030 --> 57:15.054
It's not the time yet...

57:16.032 --> 57:16.862
Signal!

57:19.936 --> 57:22.871
You're listening to Midnight Soundtrack

57:25.542 --> 57:27.567
We're back with part 3 of the show.

57:27.644 --> 57:29.771
In part 3, we'll be connecting
to one of the listeners

57:29.846 --> 57:32.371
and have a live chat.

57:40.056 --> 57:42.684
We already have a caller
I'll put him through.

57:42.759 --> 57:43.783
Hello?

57:43.860 --> 57:45.794
Hi

57:46.763 --> 57:48.594
Can you tell us who you are?

57:49.265 --> 57:50.197
About me?

57:51.668 --> 57:59.507
I'm someone who believes
this program is all about you.

57:59.576 --> 58:02.943
Your partner, Han Dong-soo.

58:03.012 --> 58:05.037
What do you mean by that?

58:05.114 --> 58:06.741
I'm saying that.

58:06.816 --> 58:12.550
I don't think anyone else
can replace you on this program.

58:12.622 --> 58:16.149
An unqualified DJ like Lim Se-yeon?

58:17.126 --> 58:18.957
Simply unacceptable!

58:19.028 --> 58:22.156
Although she won't be able to now,
even if she wants.

58:23.233 --> 58:24.165
Son of a bitch!

58:24.234 --> 58:25.064
What do you for a living?

58:25.134 --> 58:26.465
Look! Hurry!

58:26.536 --> 58:27.560
Can you tell us more...

58:28.638 --> 58:31.072
Hurry!

58:31.441 --> 58:32.874
Hello? Hello?

58:36.145 --> 58:36.975
Hang on a second.

58:37.247 --> 58:39.681
Hurry!

58:41.451 --> 58:42.679
He hung up.

58:44.153 --> 58:47.680
We have a bad connection.
Let's listen to a song first.

58:52.161 --> 58:53.492
Eun-soo!

58:59.903 --> 59:02.838
Hurry, Eun-soo!

59:21.124 --> 59:24.059
Try not to breathe heavily.
And, be careful!

59:24.127 --> 59:25.958
Sun-young, wait a little bit.

59:26.029 --> 59:28.361
There is no time
I think he found my daughter.

59:28.431 --> 59:30.456
Wait till the cops arrive.

59:32.035 --> 59:33.263
Did you call the police?

59:42.879 --> 59:44.369
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

59:47.050 --> 59:49.780
Are you crazy?
He killed a cop already.

59:49.852 --> 59:52.082
You're only provoking him!

59:52.155 --> 59:54.487
He's a nutcase!
It's too dangerous.

59:54.557 --> 59:56.388
You can't reason with him.

59:57.393 --> 01:00:00.885
If anything happens to the kids,
I swear I'll kill you.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:04.798
Don't do this.
Don't go in there!

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:09.998
Ex... excuse me...
I'll come with you.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.404
Just stop it!

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.601
I don't need this.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:17.808
I think I can help.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.214
You're a goddamn stalker, too.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.516
We're back on.

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.525
We'll try again.

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.529
- Dong-soo?
- Hello

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.929
Shall we continue
where we left off?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.332
What you do for a living?

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.132
I... I raise rabbits.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.436
Because I just adore rabbits.

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:47.237
Did you say... rabbits?

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:57.618
They love to hide from me
when I as much as blink.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:58.847
I see.

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:04.086
They are such sweet little creature

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.094
but they cause trouble time to time.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:10.931
And, one of them has
an injury on the neck.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.989
I see.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.496
As an avid listener...

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.405
What's your most...?

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.497
Wait!

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.502
You said earlier.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:29.006
Parting could be a way
to preserve love eternally.

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:30.810
That's not what I meant...

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:35.324
If my rabbits vanish one day.

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:43.230
then, I'll be able to keep
their loving memories.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:44.925
No, actually...

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.025
So, l...

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:50.836
Found the two rabbits
that got away.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:54.834
And killed them.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.540
You son of a bitch!

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:58.443
Music!

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:05.687
All force dispatch immediately.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.280
What the fuck did you do
with the kids?

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.188
What did you do with them?

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.989
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.735
- Anything?
- There's no one here.

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.106
Nobody upstairs either.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:32.410
Sun-young! He got away.

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.580
Eun-soo!

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.599
Seon-young

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.806
Was it so hard to follow
my instructions?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.804
I asked you not to leave
the studio no matter what!

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.307
He knows everything.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:48.119
It's too bad but you won't be
able to see the kids again.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.828
No... Don't do that

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:09.275
Hello? Is this the TV station?

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.883
I have information about the murder.

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:32.491
It's difficult to confirm without
an official police announcement.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.501
But, Ms. Ko Sun-young is
staying at her house

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.506
while the police is trying to locate
the perpetrator on the run.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:43.034
As Han turns out to be the one
responsible for the recent serial murders.

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.807
Relationship with Ms. Ko seems to be
the key to understanding this case

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.714
What about the show?

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:51.810
Play the songs on the list.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.814
I'll call you back.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:00.953
It's ready.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:26.383
I want to be like mommy.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.403
- This is the fax he sent you?
- Yeah.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:50.741
I pulled up his record.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:53.805
He was arrested for
attempted murder 4 years ago.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:55.111
Attempted murder?

01:05:56.152 --> 01:06:01.249
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia
during investigation.

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:05.955
I'm Ko Sun-young's partner.

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:08.155
He was sent to a mental institution
for 3 years

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.561
and got released last year.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:14.695
This type of serial killer is
known as mission-oriented

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.203
They believe they're doing

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.968
good for the society
by ridding the world of criminals.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:23.375
What about an innocent family member
or a DJ? A contribution?

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:24.777
A contribution?

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:29.477
I'm saying that he's a mental case
who believes his cause.

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.250
Look at the date the fax.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.188
I think he was motivated
by Sun-young's program.

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.691
The dates of the murders
coincide with the program schedule.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.695
Travis from "Taxi Driver",
drives his taxi every night

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:44.392
through the decadent streets
of New York.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:48.699
'Someday a real rain will come and
wash all the scum off the streets'

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:53.301
Why do get such satisfaction
from watching our heroes in the movie

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.703
Because in reality,
no-one takes care

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:59.373
of the wrongs we come
across everyday

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.449
Where is my hero right now?

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:04.747
Are you listening to me?

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:11.752
Heroes sometimes suffer
at the weight of their fate.

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:17.465
But, it's that suffering
makes them stronger.

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:22.460
Where is my hero right now?

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.562
Are you listening to me?

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.371
He's using the term partner

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:31.174
he probably wants recognition
from his object of obsession.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:35.980
I don't want to see these
psycho killers even in the movies

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.579
Sun-young is a victim, too.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.180
Stop connecting her to the case.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.091
I don't want to see these
psycho killers even in the movies.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:00.841
What!

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.037
You'd better turn on the television.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:06.878
The suspect just sent us
a video clip of himself

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:11.511
Reporter Jang Seok-hyun
has the exclusive.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:17.752
Every Saturday, this is the
quiz corner where you participate.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.057
We have a caller on hold...
Hello, 'Travis'?

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.662
Hello...?

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:24.758
Are you ready?

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:32.171
In front of me, there is a girl
that needs my help.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:39.078
The poor girl is living in hell
because of her scumbag pimp.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:46.283
And, I have her pimp who is
lower than a scumbag.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.283
Do you know lris?

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.595
I don 't know.
I've never heard that name before.

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:59.792
Is it from Taxi driver?

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.234
The final shootout scene, right?

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:05.799
Travis kills the pimp
and saves lris.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.841
Where is everybody?

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.444
And is hailed as a hero
in the press.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:16.442
Do you agree with that?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.755
Travis put his beliefs into action.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:26.759
He might be the man we need
in this time of rampant immorality

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:29.461
Well, l...

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.055
couldn't agree more.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.272
What is this?

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.270
How was that?

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:45.279
You scared me.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.679
Is this being aired?

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:50.778
It's from our show

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.582
When did you get that?

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.681
You can't just show that
on a public channel!

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:57.487
We were blackmailed, too.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.292
The suspect sent us the message

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:03.388
that if we don't release this clip
there will be another murder

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.193
The murder victim in the video
was identified as Kim Tae-soo

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:05.164
He threatened to kill the kids

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:11.798
who made the news in 2006 for
his involvement in human-trafficking.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.205
He was released on the grounds
of insufficient evidence

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.106
Sentenced innocent
by lack of evidence

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:18.977
whether there is any justice
in our society.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:22.108
Ko Sun-young who was
the newscaster at the time...

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:25.085
Ms. Ko, how do you feel right now?

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.212
Please, just one word!

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.916
Was the voice on the tape yours?

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.116
It was.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.023
How do you feel about
Han Dong-soo?

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:41.635
He...

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:48.633
He killed criminals.

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:49.643
I think...

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.846
It was a heroic act.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.453
Are you listening to me, Han?

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.081
Come on out and talk to me!

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.283
Tell me what you want!

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.288
What do you think you're doing?

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:12.499
He's a psycho threatening
to kill your kids!

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.695
This is what he wants.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.706
He's a psycho who
believes he is a hero.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.208
He'll call me again.

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:39.524
Eun-soo?

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.432
One more time, baby.

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:53.038
Can I consider
that as your recognition?

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:01.076
Yes. Isn't that what you want?

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.884
But, you're too late.

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.488
I've already killed them.

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:08.580
Liar!

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.392
You're a hero.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.986
A hero would never do
such a thing

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:21.366
Officers, have you finished
tracking the location?

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.405
Come and collect the bodies.

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.497
Han Dong-soo!

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:28.099
I'm turning myself in.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:28.905
Han Dong-soo!

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.337
Do we have his location?

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.312
Get everybody over there now!

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.611
And, request for a backup!

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:38.710
My kids... they're alive,
aren't they?

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:57.029
Ms. Ko, the sky is white
and clouds are black today.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.633
Come meet me. Hurry.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.173
Go! Go!

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:25.199
All hell broke loose here.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:28.293
Where the hell are you?

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.098
Get your ass over here, now!

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.103
Yes, sir!

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:35.700
I gotta go back to the station.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:37.711
Will you be okay?

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.412
I'm okay.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.815
Come with us, ma'am.

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:46.619
I'll take my car.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:54.826
- Keep closely behind her.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:00.668
Let's go!

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:06.974
Her car just started off.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:19.680
You should've sent out
a substitute program

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.780
I don't believe we should do
that in this situation.

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.882
What situation?

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.086
Get your ass in the studio. Now!

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:29.494
Yes, sir.

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:32.790
We have exclusive breaking news?

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:40.297
I have the fax that Han Dong-soo
sent to Ko sun-young tonight.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:40.898
Son of a bitch!

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:44.309
In the fax, there is a playlist
of songs that Han put together

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:46.404
All these movie soundtracks
have one thing in common

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:52.614
that the main character kills
villains and becomes a hero himself

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:54.019
We're heading to the place where
Han says he's turning himself in

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:56.819
Block off the press!
Don't let anyone near.

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:08.064
Are you on your way?
Can't wait to see the kids?

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.866
Then, let's get started with part 4.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.467
Tap tap tap, if the answer is yes.

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:21.477
Can you help me?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.583
We'd like to apologize
for earlier problems...

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.587
Hey!

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:38.095
Have you lost your mind?

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.690
Get out of here! Now! Out!

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.601
I'll be expecting your resignation

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:46.004
Until 4 am, this time slot
belongs to Ko Sun-young.

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:47.200
and I'm the producer in charge.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.105
Is that the car?

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.512
I think it's a recording
of Ko's program

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:59.318
Coming up in a few minutes in part 4,

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:04.856
We'll reconnect with Han Dong

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.259
Detective Cho!

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.168
Who is that?!

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.172
I did exactly as you told me.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.068
Now, where are the kids?

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:24.476
Don't worry about them.
They're safe in my hands.

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.774
Take the right.

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.776
What the...?!

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:33.678
She gave us the slip.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.891
Were following her to the west.

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:45.797
Find out who she is.
And, get an aerial backup.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:46.891
Yes, sir!

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.596
Hello! This is Han Dong-soo.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:56.011
I'm currently moving in a car
with my partner, Ko Sun-young.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:02.948
Ms. Park? Are you there?
Can we play a song first?

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.743
Is that... Is that her car?

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.656
Where are you going?

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.464
Where are the kids?

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:22.367
Stop right there.

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:25.565
You want me to stop?
The kids are in the trunk.

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.444
Just drive through.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.361
No!

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.470
No!

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.986
That's more like it, partner!

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:00.835
Stop the car!

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.846
Stop the car!

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.948
Get out of the way!

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:27.156
This city fills up with trash
like them at night.

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:31.065
Out of the way!

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:40.974
But, with your voice even things
like that turn into a scene from a movie.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.896
No!

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.396
- Sun-young!
- Keep going

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.008
No... no!

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.546
You said that I was a hero.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.638
Did you mean that?

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:57.986
I did everything you
wanted me to do.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:21:00.853
People change their words
all the time.

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:04.084
I can't feel the sincerity
in your words anymore.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.086
But, it doesn't matter.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:11.496
All they care about is
what you say.

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:16.904
We're almost there.
You'll like what I've done.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.702
You're right, Han Dong-soo.

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:26.011
I've been spitting pretentious
words out of my mouth.

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:28.504
But, you...

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:32.217
You're just a dumb killer who
can't tell a broadcast from reality.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:12.491
Eun-soo!

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:15.590
Eun-soo! My baby.

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.096
Eun-soo!

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.719
Sun-young! It's me!

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.723
What are you doing here?

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:57.331
The clouds are black
and the sky is white.

01:22:58.006 --> 01:23:01.271
Pont Neuf is
the oldest bridge on Seine.

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:06.073
And this is the oldest bridge
in Seoul.

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:11.382
Why do you keep avoiding me?

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.978
I really want to help.

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:27.296
Stop following!

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.306
Ko Sun-young!

01:23:57.132 --> 01:23:58.224
Eun-soo!

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:00.963
Kids!

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:02.660
Eun-soo!

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:13.477
Eun-soo!

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.688
Eun-soo!

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:31.089
Eun-soo! Eun-soo!

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:33.996
Detective Eom!

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:39.701
Sir!

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.303
What about the woman?
Any leads?

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:44.606
She's still unconscious.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.511
She had no identification on her.

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:09.066
Man, it's a hard day to forget.

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.968
Let the kids go.

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:15.174
You can tell me what you want.

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:17.370
I'll do anything you want.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:23.574
Ms. Park, listen to me carefully.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:25.783
The moment this show gets
interrupted,

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:28.880
I'm scared...
It's so cold here.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.788
the kids will die.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.686
Is that clear?

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:45.806
We'll continue with the show.

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:51.102
I'm at the place where
Han Dong-soo lives.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:57.812
Let's hear from him directly
why he committed these crimes.

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:05.458
Dear Midnight F.M. listeners
a special corner.

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:08.462
It's your turn, Sun-young.

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.375
Do you recognize him?

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:29.575
He's a trash!

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.781
A piece of trash that
needs to be swept away.

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:41.488
You said

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:44.794
I'm scared to raise my daughter
in this world.

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.071
That's right, everyone!

01:26:55.076 --> 01:27:03.848
Sun-young will shoot
the guys with this gun.

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.046
And become a hero herself.

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:11.455
Leave me alone!

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.161
Sir!

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:22.134
What the hell?

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.871
What the fuck are they doing?

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.469
You think this your show?

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.472
Who is this?

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.677
Psychos!

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:44.788
Hey... Hey!

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:49.496
You wanna see them all die?

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:59.932
Back off, Han Dong-soo.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.335
This is my show.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.241
I'll host it to the end.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.947
Are you all right?

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.048
We've got to get the show going.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.753
Stay with us till the end.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.060
Damn!

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.168
Park!

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:31.569
Get your ass over to
the control room.

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:39.071
What are you doing?

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.078
Tic toc! 4 minutes passed...

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:47.787
Eun-soo, hurry!

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:52.686
- Tell me if anyone comes this way.
- Got it

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.103
Shall we get started again?

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.734
Look,

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:11.040
This man is a filthy low life
human-trafficking scum.

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.136
that needs to be swept off.

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.737
What do you mean
human-trafficker?

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.645
She is my sister!

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:20.051
She ran away from home!

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:23.146
He's lying.

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:26.250
What did you do with my sister?

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:28.056
Where is she?

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:30.163
We don't have much time.

01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:33.564
Fuck you!
You're delusional.

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:34.965
Find him! Now!

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:39.405
Even a criminal deserves the law.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:40.304
Law?

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.572
They'll sneak out with a fine.

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:47.878
Who are you calling a criminal?!

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.076
Is that train sound
in the background?

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:51.648
Train runs at this hour?

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.983
From all the listeners out there
only you...!

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.789
How did you feel when
Kim Tae-soo was found dead?

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.788
You were happy
that I did it for you.

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:08.997
Then you should be thankful

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.698
Leaves us all puzzled as to
where there is any justice.

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:19.403
Now, it's your turn.

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:21.615
Ms. Ko...

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:26.016
Shoot that scumbag and be my partner.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.318
Fuck yourself!
You crazy psycho!

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:35.226
Search around the train tracks
where trains are still running.

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:38.026
Search around the train tracks
where trains are still running.

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:56.142
In about 5 minutes,
blood will start to freeze.

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.047
It's your call.

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:03.585
Listen, lady! Just calm down.

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:06.491
Is it going to be your kids
or that piece of trash?

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:11.888
Go on, do it!

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.998
Like you said on the radio!

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:20.404
No...

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:27.513
Promise me.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:33.416
That you'll let my kids go
if I shoot that scumbag.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.015
I'm not a liar like you.

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:43.125
Hey, wait! No...!
No! Don't shoot!

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:45.995
No! Don't shoot!

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:50.236
Eun-soo, I'm scared...

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.775
Please, don't shoot me!

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.883
No... please! You can't do this!

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:10.485
Three...

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:21.599
- Why...? What did I do?
- Two...

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.995
Please... No! Don't kill me.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.608
One!

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.512
I'm not a scum.

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.019
My brother...

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.321
I'll get you out.

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:21.191
Han Dong-soo!

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.793
Tell the listeners!

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:31.895
That you'll.
Let my kids go if I kill this scum.

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.113
- No... no... no...
- You lied to me again!

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.679
Help us!

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:24.285
Go! Hurry!

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:33.492
Run! As fast as you can!

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.907
We haven't got much time.

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:48.849
Come on! Hurry!

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:13.066
Sun-young! Sun-young!

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.366
What the fuck?!

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.893
You ruined everything!

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:43.300
You ruined everything!

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:51.910
You...

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.809
Get moving!

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:05.951
Sun-young that talked to me
always said the right thing.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:17.062
Drop the knife!
Put your hands up where I can see 'em.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:26.372
It's over, Han Dong-soo.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:29.874
Wait!

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:39.684
People should never hear
your voice again

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.588
Han Dong-soo

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.190
Go to hell.

01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:10.251
Did you get that shot?

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:20.165
We'll get a direct interview
with Ko Sun-young

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.236
You'll be reunited
with the children soon.

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.434
How do you feel now?

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.145
I'm reporter Jang from GCN.

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:07.441
Any comment, please.

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:08.538
Step back, please!

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:46.672
Hey, can you stop for a second?

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:57.981
Be gentle!

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.083
I got shot.

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.097
Are you okay?

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.061
Don't worry about the reporters.

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:13.196
They'll forget all about it soon.

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.003
I'm sorry, sir.

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.010
We'll get moving.

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:41.032
You must have felt the need to escape
from this suffocating daily routine

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.831
How about you go
crazy today for once?

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:44.836
Turn it off

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:45.599
Are you willing to go wild?

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:46.639
Excuse me?

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:49.733
Then follow my instructions.

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.641
Turn the goddamn radio off!
