WEBVTT

00:17.684 --> 00:19.060
Are you surprised that the team

00:19.144 --> 00:21.396
has stayed together and the chemistry
has been that good,

00:21.479 --> 00:24.315
with all the backstabbing between you
and coach and everything else?

00:56.848 --> 00:58.141
Way to go, Craig.

02:02.997 --> 02:06.042
Starts off with hard work,
ends in champagne. Let's start.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.614
Was it unusual for him
to be out of contact with you?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.338
Where was that meeting?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.552
-Just the two of you?
-Yeah.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.372
What's your opinion of the theory that

18:44.039 --> 18:47.668
Commissioner Stern suspended Michael
for 18 months?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.959
So Michael Jordan left the league
of his own volition in 1993?

21:57.733 --> 22:00.861
<i>Do you recall</i>
<i>your last conversation with him?</i>

25:59.849 --> 26:02.477
Did you feel betrayed by that <i>SI</i> cover?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.728
So when you want to get in the cage?

26:44.811 --> 26:46.187
-7:30?
-I'm there.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.089
Scott Burrell.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.509
What up, Scott?

30:03.259 --> 30:04.719
You ready today?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.679
We gonna bust y'all ass today.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.974
Yeah, I know. We wounded. We're wounded.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.519
Hey, when there's a sick dog down,
keep 'em down.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.687
Yeah, but you better watch out
for the lead dog,

30:14.771 --> 30:16.147
he'll bite the shit out of you.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.787
Scott, I advise you to guard
somebody else, like Jud.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.789
You can't even guard Jud.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.541
I don't wanna be... I wanna guard you.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.084
You don't wanna... Hey.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.460
If you can guard me,

30:37.544 --> 30:40.171
there's 290-something jobs
looking for you.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.513
Garbage. Don't bring that bullshit.

31:42.191 --> 31:45.028
Go sit your asses down! Game time!

31:45.111 --> 31:46.821
That's nine, bitch!

31:47.530 --> 31:49.866
Hey, Scott Burrell,
where your mouth at now, homie?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.366
Shoot a layup, you dumbass!

33:21.374 --> 33:24.043
You couldn't make a damn jump shot
all night long.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.337
How many did you make?
You made one, didn't you?

33:26.921 --> 33:27.922
One for seven.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.968
I feel bad for you, dog, your cat's sick.
Go home and feed it Purina Cat Chow.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.979
Come on, Scott Burrell.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.732
You wanna be on this damn team,
you better do something right.

33:45.815 --> 33:46.983
Make this free throw.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.113
How did the team do
that first season without Michael?

43:51.253 --> 43:54.173
Let's go out and play hard. Let's prove
we can play better than game one.

46:11.977 --> 46:14.396
Hey, I'm a collector, man.
You owe me a thousand bucks.

47:07.574 --> 47:09.660
Through the years,
do you think that intensity

47:09.743 --> 47:13.580
has come at the expense of being perceived
as a nice guy?
