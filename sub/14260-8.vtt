Oh, no, no, I--
I can't right now, guys.

Something really weird

The Earth

02:16.103 --> 02:18.770
Okay, so I made
a lucky guess.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.439
This is incredible.
These figures show

02:21.441 --> 02:23.875
that the Earth is moving
closer to the sun!

Guys, if this keeps up,

02:31.050 --> 02:33.451
the Earth could go
crashing into the sun.

Raphael.
[chuckling]
Of course.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.802
I meant Raphael.

08:24.804 --> 08:28.106
And this is my
good pal Leonardo.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.473
Michelangelo.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.709
I know who they are,

08:31.711 --> 08:34.077
I also know
their birthdays,

to match.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.221
Hi, Foster.
Vernon said you really
wanted to meet us.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.389
Not at all.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.558
But I knew you'd
want to meet me,

08:55.535 --> 08:58.636
It works on the principle

to yours truly.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.721
Gosh, it's good to be me.

09:20.759 --> 09:22.593
[Donatello]
Uh, but you see, little guy,

09:22.595 --> 09:26.163
if you're Solar Magnet
is pulling the Earth
closer to the sun,

09:26.165 --> 09:28.932
our planet could
heat up to, oh,

09:28.934 --> 09:31.169
[yelling]
30,000 degrees!

09:31.171 --> 09:33.637
Don't sweat it, big guy.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.640
I'll turn it off as soon
as it wins me first prize.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.210
Okay, that does it!

09:41.814 --> 09:44.215
Donatello,
what are you doing?

09:44.217 --> 09:46.116
Whoa, the dude's
wigging out!

09:46.118 --> 09:48.118
Grab him!

09:51.056 --> 09:54.625
Let go of me!
I've got to save the world!

09:54.627 --> 09:57.495
[sighing]
Oh, sorry about
your invention, Foster.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.631
But Donatello's been
a little stressed out
lately.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.767
You mean a little wacko!

10:02.769 --> 10:05.802
Look what he's done
to my science project!

10:05.804 --> 10:06.970
Foster,

10:06.972 --> 10:09.006
this isn't my fault.
I swear.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.742
I barely know
those slimy reptiles!

10:11.744 --> 10:13.677
Hey, don't sweat it, Unc.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.414
I can put this thing
back together in no time.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.983
You can?
Piece of cake.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.452
They don't call me
a genius for nothing.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.153
[Leonardo]
That was a terrible
thing to do.

10:23.155 --> 10:26.190
Foster's worked hard
on that science project of his.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.627
That's right, amigo.
He's just a micro-dude.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.995
Oh, yeah, sure,

10:30.997 --> 10:34.665
a micro-dude
whose toy could destroy
the entire planet!

10:34.667 --> 10:37.835
That Solar Magnet is pulling
the Earth closer to the sun
every minute.

10:37.837 --> 10:42.306
See? The atmosphere is already
11 degrees above normal.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.942
[Raphael]
Oh, will you cool it
with this heat business?

10:44.944 --> 10:47.445
We're just having
a little warm spell.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.380
[cheeping]

10:56.455 --> 10:58.723
A Solar Magnet.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.725
Just the invention
I've been searching for

11:00.727 --> 11:03.327
to put my evil plan
into action!

11:12.905 --> 11:14.605
[Michelangelo]
Hey, scope it out,
compadres.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.007
April's covering
the science fair.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.410
<i>Thank you, Billy, for that</i>
<i>fascinating demonstration</i>

11:19.412 --> 11:21.446
<i>of your jet-propelled</i>
<i>space shoes,</i>

11:21.448 --> 11:24.081
and, uh, better luck
next time.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.382
Our next competitor

11:25.384 --> 11:29.720
<i>is Foster Fenwick,</i>
<i>who has an I.Q. of 270.</i>

11:29.722 --> 11:32.389
271, but why quibble?

11:32.391 --> 11:35.893
Tell us, Foster,
who is your favorite
scientific hero?

11:35.895 --> 11:38.796
Is it Einstein?
Newton? Pasteur?

11:38.798 --> 11:41.298
Au contraire.
Those bubble brains

11:41.300 --> 11:43.667
couldn't hold a candle
to my personal idol,

11:43.669 --> 11:46.236
Professor Philo Sofo.

11:46.238 --> 11:49.273
Professor Sofo?
That demented dingbat?

11:49.275 --> 11:50.608
<i>[April]</i>
<i>Professor Sofo?</i>

11:50.610 --> 11:51.942
<i>But isn't he</i>
<i>the one who tried</i>

11:51.944 --> 11:53.978
<i>to spin everyone off</i>
<i>the face of the Earth?</i>

11:53.980 --> 11:55.879
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

11:55.881 --> 11:59.116
Well, not only is
the little brat brilliant,

11:59.118 --> 12:01.251
he also has
excellent taste.

12:01.253 --> 12:04.154
Uh, um, uh,
maybe you'd better
tell us

12:04.156 --> 12:05.656
something about
your invention.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.158
Better than that,
I'll show you.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.262
Presenting the world's
first and only

12:12.264 --> 12:16.634
auto-transmogrifying
inter-dimensional
Solar Magnet.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.703
My-- My magnet!

12:18.705 --> 12:19.871
It's gone!

12:23.141 --> 12:27.411
Foster, my poor
little genius nephew!

12:27.413 --> 12:30.715
What sort of heartless beast
would do such a thing?

12:30.717 --> 12:33.617
I bet it was
that mean old turtle!

12:33.619 --> 12:36.854
I want my magnet,
I want my magnet!

12:36.856 --> 12:38.322
<i>Ahhh!</i>

12:38.324 --> 12:40.991
Donatello, what did you do
with Foster's Solar Magnet?

12:40.993 --> 12:43.227
Yeah, you big green meanie.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.429
Why don't you just
give it back to the kid?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.566
Hey, I didn't take it,
guys, honest.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.133
But I wish I had.

12:50.135 --> 12:52.603
If that contraption
falls into the wrong hands,

12:52.605 --> 12:54.938
it could mean
the end of the world.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.640
<i>[Foster whining]</i>

12:56.642 --> 12:59.209
<i>Waah!</i>

13:00.512 --> 13:02.813
<i>People of the world, hear me.</i>

13:02.815 --> 13:06.016
Look, it's that nutcase,
Professor Sofo!

13:06.018 --> 13:09.119
Hello.
I have the Solar Magnet,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.255
and I have set it
on full power.

13:11.257 --> 13:14.925
Even now, the Earth
is speeding toward the sun.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.027
See? I told you
I didn't take it.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.062
Okay, so we made
a mistake,

13:19.064 --> 13:20.731
we're only half human,
you know.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.366
<i>And while I am safe</i>

13:22.368 --> 13:24.735
<i>in my secret</i>
<i>underground laboratory,</i>

13:24.737 --> 13:28.406
<i>you innocent citizens</i>
<i>will all be French-fried.</i>

13:28.408 --> 13:29.806
Then, when I have destroyed

13:29.808 --> 13:31.342
every living thing
on this planet,

13:31.344 --> 13:34.044
I shall be
its undisputed ruler!

13:34.046 --> 13:35.045
Ruler of what?

13:35.047 --> 13:37.681
The heating up process
cannot be reversed.

13:37.683 --> 13:41.351
You have exactly 11--
no, no, 12 hours

13:41.353 --> 13:44.321
to leave the planet
before it is burned
to a cinder.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.657
[giggling]
Have a nice day.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.326
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I kill me.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.496
[sighing]
Looks like you were right
all along, Donatello.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.166
Yeah, dude.
Sorry I called you
a green meanie.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.335
And we thought
you were ready for
the giggle factory.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.305
Forget it, guys.
You can grovel at my feet

14:01.307 --> 14:03.273
after we find
that Solar Magnet.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.143
But where do
we start looking?
It could be anywhere.

14:06.145 --> 14:09.413
Why don't we start
at that university
Professor Sofo used to run?

14:09.415 --> 14:11.415
[Raphael]
Right, Sofo U.,

14:11.417 --> 14:13.217
it's where Donatello
got his degree.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.185
[Michelangelo]
I think I missed
that episode.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.219
[Leonardo]
Oh, really?

14:16.221 --> 14:18.188
[Donatello]
Yeah, I was brilliant.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.791
<i>[TurtleCom beeping]</i>

14:20.793 --> 14:23.427
It's the TurtleCom.
Hey, April, what's up?

14:23.429 --> 14:27.231
<i>Donatello, I told Foster</i>
<i>you're probably</i>
<i>tracking down Sofo.</i>

14:27.233 --> 14:30.501
<i>He wants to go with you</i>
<i>and help dismantle</i>
<i>the Solar Magnet.</i>

14:30.503 --> 14:33.070
[Donatello]
Oh, no way.
It's too dangerous.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.706
Besides,
I dismantled it once.
I can do it again.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.041
Let me have that.
Hey!

14:38.043 --> 14:40.076
Look, you ridiculous
reptiles,

14:40.078 --> 14:42.346
When I reassembled
the Solar Magnet,

14:42.348 --> 14:44.114
I made it tamper-proof.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.617
Nobody but me
can take it apart.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.452
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

14:53.591 --> 14:54.992
[Donatello]
Well, Foster,

14:54.994 --> 14:57.427
I'm glad you had
a change of heart
and decided to help.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.329
What change of heart,
pizza breath?

14:59.331 --> 15:03.000
I just came along
to meet my hero,
Professor Sofo.

15:03.002 --> 15:04.501
I really can't believe

15:04.503 --> 15:06.971
you think he would want
to fry the Earth to a crisp.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.306
[Foster]
It's obviously some mistake.

15:09.308 --> 15:13.310
Hey, look at that:
110 degrees!

15:13.312 --> 15:14.812
I was afraid of that.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.281
The heat is growing
more intense by the minute.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.685
It's hot in here,
and I'm thirsty.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.354
Sorry, Vernon,
there's no time to stop.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.690
Oh, this is boring.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.958
Are we there yet?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.994
[Professor Sofo]
Ah, at last,

15:29.996 --> 15:32.530
after years of planning
and scheming,

15:32.532 --> 15:34.331
I should finally
have my vengeance

15:34.333 --> 15:36.667
against an uncaring world!

15:36.669 --> 15:38.469
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

15:38.471 --> 15:41.638
[Leonardo]
Faster, Michelangelo.
Every second counts!

15:41.640 --> 15:42.840
I don't get it.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.708
I've got the pedal
to the metal,

15:44.710 --> 15:47.377
but instead of going faster,
we're going slower!

15:47.379 --> 15:50.948
Bummer, dudes!
The tar on the road
is melting!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.249
We're stuck!

16:04.729 --> 16:07.598
The intense heat is causing
the road to melt!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.400
We must get to Sofo College

16:09.402 --> 16:12.836
and turn off that Solar Magnet
before this heat increases.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.671
I just remembered
something.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.874
Quick, Michelangelo,
hit that dashboard button.

16:17.876 --> 16:18.942
[beep]

16:23.815 --> 16:26.350
[Leonardo]
We're moving, the road
stopped melting!

16:26.352 --> 16:29.019
[Michelangelo]
Awesome move, dude!
How'd you do it?

16:29.021 --> 16:30.321
Well, luckily,
I'd installed

16:30.323 --> 16:31.822
some instant freeze
spray jets

16:31.824 --> 16:33.324
for just such
an emergency.

16:35.693 --> 16:37.328
[popping]
Oh!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.897
Now someone's shooting at us!

16:39.899 --> 16:41.599
Don't shoot! We surrender!

16:41.601 --> 16:43.333
[Raphael]
Those aren't gunshots.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.269
This intense heat
is popping all the corn!

16:47.472 --> 16:49.206
[tires screeching]

16:50.441 --> 16:53.109
All right, Sofo, give it up!

16:53.111 --> 16:54.778
The place is deserted.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.513
I was afraid of that.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.515
He's moved his lab
somewhere else.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.883
Well, we must find him.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.352
I need to explain to him

17:01.354 --> 17:03.720
the danger of using
my invention.

17:03.722 --> 17:06.022
Hey, look!
Footprints.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.992
Aha. My suspicions
were correct!

17:08.994 --> 17:11.662
We're definitely dealing
with someone with feet.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.597
Good, Uncle Vernon.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.734
They lead over here,
to this shovel.

17:19.371 --> 17:23.138
Hmm, this mud is definitely
not indigenous to this area.

17:23.141 --> 17:25.709
Well, let me check it
with my portable earth-alizer.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.879
A sedimentary base
with an alluvial sub-soil.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.014
It shows this mud
came from the area

17:31.016 --> 17:33.684
of 109th Street
and Center Park West.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.720
So that's where Sofo's
secret laboratory is hidden:

17:36.722 --> 17:38.589
underneath Center Park.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.290
Right in the middle
of the city.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.593
Dudes, let's make
turtle tracks.

17:44.895 --> 17:47.565
[Professor Sofo]
Oh, the outside temperature

17:47.567 --> 17:48.833
is reaching
the critical point.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.402
Soon the Earth
will be barren
of all living creatures,

17:52.404 --> 17:54.004
except me!

17:54.006 --> 17:57.441
Uh, and us, too, boss,
don't forget us.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.643
What? Oh, right,
and you, too.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.178
[chuckling]
Of course.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.514
[laughing]
Not!

18:03.516 --> 18:05.749
Uh, you know,
he's definitely

18:05.751 --> 18:08.285
the nicest villain
we ever worked for.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.921
He certainly is.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.624
April O'Neil here,
with a Channel 6 update.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.993
As the Earth moves
ever closer to the sun,

18:15.995 --> 18:18.395
temperatures are
reaching record highs.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.964
We've been receiving reports
of intense heat damage

18:20.966 --> 18:24.467
from such far away places
as the Paris Wax Museum...

18:30.942 --> 18:32.242
[creaking]

18:32.244 --> 18:35.346
to the tulip fields
of Holland...

18:35.348 --> 18:38.315
to the ski runs
of the Swiss Alps.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.721
[tires screeching]

18:46.924 --> 18:49.593
[beeping]

18:49.595 --> 18:51.995
Listen to this
earth-alizer beep.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.897
We must be getting warm.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.433
[Vernon]
Oh! We're getting
warm, all right!

18:57.769 --> 19:00.837
Only one thing to do.

19:02.907 --> 19:05.642
[Michelangelo]
Way to go, compadre!

19:05.644 --> 19:07.243
It's this intense heat.

19:07.245 --> 19:10.146
The trees are starting
to spontaneously combust.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.116
Wow, in another minute,
they'll all be going up
in flames,

19:13.118 --> 19:15.251
unless we can locate
that Solar Magnet.

19:15.253 --> 19:17.020
[Donatello]
Hey guys, over here!

19:17.022 --> 19:18.355
[beeping]
I think I found the way

19:18.357 --> 19:21.792
to Sofo's underground
laboratory.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.296
Finally, a chance
to meet my hero,

19:25.298 --> 19:28.933
The Great Professor
Philo Sofo!

19:28.935 --> 19:31.936
[Professor Sofo]
Yes, another few moments,

19:31.938 --> 19:34.371
and the Earth will be
fricasseed to a crisp.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.705
Hee hee--
[alarm]

19:36.808 --> 19:39.342
Intruders?
What in blazes--

19:39.344 --> 19:41.511
Hey, Bone Dome,
remember us?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.079
[gasping]
Ugh, it's those blasted

19:43.081 --> 19:45.482
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles again!

19:45.484 --> 19:47.718
They're always ruining
my good times!

19:51.322 --> 19:54.224
[all]
Turtle Pow--

19:55.092 --> 19:57.193
[all]
Ugh!

19:57.195 --> 19:59.396
Who put that
force field there?

19:59.398 --> 20:00.497
Fools!

20:00.499 --> 20:04.134
No one can penetrate
my gyro-atomic force field!

20:04.136 --> 20:06.003
Except me, that is!

20:06.005 --> 20:08.371
Oh, how do you do,
Professor?

20:08.373 --> 20:10.507
This is a great honor.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.342
Who-- Who let you in?

20:12.344 --> 20:14.044
The name is Foster Fenwick,

20:14.046 --> 20:16.646
fellow genius,
and your biggest fan.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.215
If you're ever
free for lunch--

20:18.217 --> 20:21.117
Can't someone get
this brat out of here?

20:21.119 --> 20:23.319
Uh,
right, Professor.

20:23.321 --> 20:26.857
Brat? But, sir,
I'm a scientific colleague.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.792
I invented that Solar Magnet,

20:28.794 --> 20:31.327
and you obviously
do not understand

20:31.329 --> 20:32.829
the magnitude of its power.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.631
Hey, hey, you gorillas!

20:34.633 --> 20:36.165
Let him go.
He's just a little kid!

20:36.167 --> 20:39.002
And a helpless
little kid at that!

20:39.004 --> 20:40.871
Ow! Ow!
Ooh!

20:44.175 --> 20:46.310
[Michelangelo]
Cool move, micro-dude!

20:46.312 --> 20:48.545
Turtle Pow--
what?

20:48.547 --> 20:50.981
This time,
let's just walk, okay?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.148
Oh, good idea.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.685
Exterminate them!

21:01.526 --> 21:04.027
And people think
children are a problem.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.095
Let them try having nephews!

21:07.766 --> 21:11.434
It's time you dudes got
into some heavy literature.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.573
[both]
Oh!

21:16.575 --> 21:18.842
[Raphael]
Look, there goes Sofo!

21:18.844 --> 21:21.210
Leaving so soon,
Professor Sofo?

21:21.212 --> 21:22.412
Where's the fire?

21:24.649 --> 21:26.483
Whoa, whoa!

21:28.853 --> 21:30.754
And if that weren't enough...

21:35.526 --> 21:38.062
What happened?

21:38.064 --> 21:40.530
Donatello, quick!

21:40.532 --> 21:44.067
We've got
less than 60 seconds
till total burnout!

21:44.069 --> 21:46.103
Can you dismantle it
that fast?

21:46.105 --> 21:48.605
No way. It's got
to be blown up.

21:48.607 --> 21:49.873
But how?

21:49.875 --> 21:51.374
I've got it.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.344
We'll concentrate the energy
of Sofo's force field--

21:54.346 --> 21:56.746
And redirect it at the magnet.

21:56.748 --> 21:57.781
Will you help me?

21:57.783 --> 22:00.717
You know I will, green bud.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.823
Five seconds
to detonation.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.792
4...3...

22:08.794 --> 22:10.961
2...1!

22:13.598 --> 22:17.033
All right!
Way to go,Foster!

22:17.035 --> 22:19.470
You brat!
No true scientist

22:19.472 --> 22:22.072
would ever
think of destroying
his own invention!

22:22.074 --> 22:24.207
How wrong you are,
Professor.

22:24.209 --> 22:28.045
No true scientist would ever
think of destroying the world.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.780
That's my nephew.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.682
Uh, did I mention
that he's a genius?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.818
<i>[April on TV]</i>
<i>And so temperatures</i>
<i>all over the world</i>

22:34.820 --> 22:36.687
<i>are now back to normal,</i>

22:36.689 --> 22:38.389
<i>thanks to four turtles</i>

22:38.391 --> 22:40.924
<i>and an 11-year-old</i>
<i>science major.</i>

22:40.926 --> 22:42.760
She's talking
about you, Foster.

22:42.762 --> 22:46.096
<i>This is April O'Neil</i>
<i>signing off.</i>

22:46.098 --> 22:47.730
To Donatello,

22:47.732 --> 22:50.300
the greatest inventor
of them all.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.569
No, you got
the wrong turtle,
Fos-man.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.171
Michelangelo's
the inventor
of our group.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.205
Okay, let's see.
I'm in the mood

22:56.207 --> 23:00.410
for a chocolate fudge
sardine chili pepper pizza

23:00.412 --> 23:02.646
with plenty
of whipped cream on top!

23:02.648 --> 23:04.948
Heh heh heh heh.
See what I mean?
