Not right now, thanks.
You were saying?

To find the guy,
we'd have to comb through

- [Mother's Milk] Don't worry.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.313
Soldier Boy's not gonna trace
this back to you. Trust me.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.399
Oh, trust you.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.818
Like I trusted him?

33:47.901 --> 33:50.112
You forget what happened
last time I helped?

33:50.195 --> 33:53.449
- The underage hooker sting
on Electroshock?
- Oh. Oh.

33:54.825 --> 33:57.494
You can't trust a man like that.

33:57.578 --> 33:59.621
Everything and everyone
he touches turns to shit.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.415
Well, you can trust me

34:01.498 --> 34:03.417
to bash your fucking brains out
with that leg, mate.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.710
Butcher, please.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.215
Look, I'm the one you trust.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.509
Now, you know what Soldier Boy
did to my family.

34:12.593 --> 34:15.637
And you know
because you okayed the cover-up.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.182
Shit, I... I okayed
a million cover-ups.

34:18.265 --> 34:20.350
And they're all tearing you up.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.145
So just make this one right,
will you?

34:25.189 --> 34:26.607
[exhales]

34:28.192 --> 34:30.110
I thought
I was staring at a ghost,

34:30.194 --> 34:31.862
but it was him.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.865
He had a fucked-up beard, maybe,

34:34.948 --> 34:37.576
- but he hadn't aged a day.
- [Hughie] Wait,
so he doesn't get old?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.661
- Like Stormfront?
- We kept that under wraps.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.955
Though it got a little fishy
when he starred

34:42.039 --> 34:44.708
in that Love and War picture
with Phoebe Cates.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.543
He was 63. She was 19.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.962
Oh, fuck. Remember Entrapment?

34:49.046 --> 34:51.590
Connery banged Zeta-Jones.
He was, like, a thousand.

34:51.673 --> 34:53.300
Why was Soldier Boy here?

34:53.383 --> 34:55.761
Came to pick up his super suit.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.346
I held on to it.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.931
You know me. I'm sentimental.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.225
Although I did actually wear
the suit once

35:01.308 --> 35:02.643
for Kelly LeBrock.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.187
By the way, her, too.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.940
You don't know Kelly LeBrock?
Fucking google it.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.650
Big "L." Big "B."

35:09.733 --> 35:11.777
The other letters, small.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.362
So, did he tell you
where he was going next?

35:13.445 --> 35:16.281
Or that he was gonna blow up
a fucking restaurant on 59th?

35:16.365 --> 35:18.617
Who the hell knows
why talent does what they do?

35:18.700 --> 35:20.035
That's why they're talent.

35:24.706 --> 35:27.292
He also came
for his girlfriend's address.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.045
He's headed there.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.964
Crimson Countess?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.259
Why?

35:36.301 --> 35:38.512
I didn't get the feeling
it was gonna be a happy reunion,

35:38.595 --> 35:41.390
but I don't know.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.767
Maybe you can go there
and find out.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.854
But mostly,
get the fuck out of here.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.023
[Cameron] Today's attack

35:50.107 --> 35:51.358
- on 59th Street.
- [Homelander] Yeah.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.402
How great a threat
is America facing?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.570
Oh, no threat whatsoever.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.864
No. Truly, i-it is a stretch

35:56.947 --> 35:59.825
to even call this guy
a supervillain. [chuckles]

35:59.908 --> 36:01.451
The Stormchasers,
Stormfront's supporters,

36:01.535 --> 36:03.078
said on 4chan
that this whole thing

36:03.161 --> 36:05.247
was an attempt by Stan Edgar
to discredit you.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.707
[chuckles] Right. Yeah.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.834
Well, look, I-I don't know
anything about Stormchasers,

36:08.917 --> 36:12.588
but, uh, look, I can understand
why they might think that.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.756
The minute we free Vought
of the corruption

36:14.840 --> 36:16.508
and the lies, and this happens.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.220
I mean, the timing
is, uh, very convenient.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.597
Smells like a false flag.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.640
- Well,
you said it, pal, not me.
- [chuckles]

36:23.724 --> 36:26.393
[Cameron] And what do you say
to the mayor who wants to, uh,

36:26.476 --> 36:28.437
impose a citywide curfew
until the terrorists

36:28.520 --> 36:29.563
- are captured?
- Oh, please.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.981
America is safe.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.274
Okay? It is safe.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.401
So, everyone, get out there.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.736
Go to your restaurants

36:35.819 --> 36:38.030
and, uh,
go to your movie theaters

36:38.113 --> 36:39.656
and-and live your lives.

36:39.740 --> 36:40.991
Have fun, okay?

36:41.074 --> 36:43.410
[Homelander] You think it really
was Edgar and the mayor?

36:43.493 --> 36:45.203
Maybe Jake Tapper.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.790
Trying to fuck with me?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.459
Make me look ridiculous?

36:50.542 --> 36:52.628
[TV turns off]

36:52.711 --> 36:54.713
Or maybe

36:54.796 --> 36:58.383
you're just
a paranoid, malignant narcissist

36:58.467 --> 37:01.219
who thinks
everything is about you.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.055
Mm, it's not paranoia

37:03.138 --> 37:05.349
if they're really
out to get you, though.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.811
And you, Maeve.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.649
You're out to get me,
aren't you?

37:17.319 --> 37:19.237
What are you talking about?

37:19.321 --> 37:20.656
William Butcher.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.783
I can smell him all over you.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.453
You really will do anything
to hurt me, won't you?

37:28.705 --> 37:30.958
So...

37:31.041 --> 37:33.377
what are you and William
cooking up?

37:33.460 --> 37:35.545
Hmm?

37:35.629 --> 37:38.382
Maybe you two brought
that supervillain to town.

37:38.465 --> 37:39.716
[chuckles] Oh, John.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.052
John, come on.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.388
You're talking crazy.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.808
- I'm not cooking anything up
with Butcher.
- [chuckles softly]

37:47.891 --> 37:49.351
Let's talk about this.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.478
Don't you dare
fucking "John" me.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.439
You're not gonna weasel
your way out of this.

37:55.440 --> 37:59.528
You know the real tragic thing
in all of this?

37:59.611 --> 38:03.865
It's that, more than anyone,
I knew what it was like for you.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.867
Swarmed everywhere we went.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.370
Every little mistake,
front-page news.

38:08.453 --> 38:13.333
It is lonely at the top, yes,
but at least we had each other.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.085
We were lonely together.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.255
And I loved you.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.340
In my own way.

38:23.176 --> 38:24.761
But you...

38:26.346 --> 38:27.639
What happened?

38:27.723 --> 38:31.101
Was anything about us ever real?

38:31.184 --> 38:32.769
Hmm?

38:47.034 --> 38:49.911
From the start,

38:49.995 --> 38:51.288
I hated you.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.206
[chuckles softly]

38:55.709 --> 38:58.211
But what's more,

38:58.295 --> 39:01.131
I fucking pitied you.

39:03.759 --> 39:06.678
You're completely
and utterly alone.

39:06.762 --> 39:08.847
You're getting old and bitter.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.350
You pity me?

39:17.898 --> 39:19.816
I mean,
that's actually kind of funny,

39:19.900 --> 39:22.027
don't you think? [chuckles]

39:25.489 --> 39:26.865
Hey.

39:27.908 --> 39:30.869

something else that's funny?

39:52.974 --> 39:57.187
Look, I know how you feel
about this shite,

39:57.270 --> 39:59.564
but it's Soldier Boy.

39:59.648 --> 40:01.191
So why don't you come down

40:01.274 --> 40:03.693

Yeah. Him.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.128
if you don't draw
the line somewhere,

40:21.211 --> 40:23.797
how the hell are you gonna know
where you stand?

40:23.880 --> 40:25.882
They ain't drawing no line.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.843
Which is why we got to.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.263
I'm in. Give me some.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.307
Kid, didn't you just hear
a goddamn word I said?

40:34.391 --> 40:36.226
I mean, who do you guys want?
Do you guys w-want

40:43.692 --> 40:45.110
With it, I can actually help.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.696
Without it, I'm...

41:15.682 --> 41:17.893
- did he do to Maeve?
- That's all right, Gregory.

41:17.976 --> 41:21.062
Maeve is at the Global Wellness
Retreat in Malibu.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.523
Asking for help,
it's just not easy.

41:23.607 --> 41:27.611
And she is just truly
Brave Maeve, isn't she?

41:27.694 --> 41:29.654
Mm-hmm. I want to speak
to her right now.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.740
Unfortunately, the facility
requires a digital detox

41:31.823 --> 41:34.409

you can leave her a message.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.536
Goddamn it, Ashley!

41:36.620 --> 41:39.080
- We can't let him do this.

He is out of control.

41:44.044 --> 41:46.087
