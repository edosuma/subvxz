WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:07.223
Brace yourself.

00:07.465 --> 00:08.766
It goes like this.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.864
Give me a "G"! Give me a "R"!

00:13.888 --> 00:16.283
Give me an "A"! Give me an "N"!

00:16.306 --> 00:17.534
Give me a "T"!

00:17.558 --> 00:19.453
What do you got? Nothing!

00:19.477 --> 00:21.580
What do you got? <i>Nada!</i>

00:21.604 --> 00:24.124
What do you got? Zilch!

00:24.148 --> 00:25.793
They repeat it three times?

00:25.817 --> 00:27.284
That's the humiliating part.

00:27.652 --> 00:30.464
Apparently some of the cheerleaders
are hanging out with the debate team.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.081
It improves their image.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.916
It's lonely at the bottom.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.970
You guys gunning for
0 and five tonight?

00:35.994 --> 00:36.887
Yeah, some of us.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.255
Some are going to be on
the sidelines, praying.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.840
Yeah. The lucky ones.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.342
You ought to try scoring.
I bet it would help.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.387
Oh, gosh, not game day again.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.607
I hate it when Bailey cries.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.350
I had a speck in my eye, Claudia.
I was tearing.

00:51.592 --> 00:53.070
Maybe if you guys tried scoring.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.405
Hey, you know, it
could be worse.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.366
There's a team in San Mateo who
hasn't won in three years.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.108
Aren't they an all-girls school?

00:59.559 --> 01:00.869
Your point being?

01:00.893 --> 01:02.329
That time of the week again?

01:02.353 --> 01:05.040
You guys are gonna get arrested for
impersonating a football team.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.501
Nah, not a good
enough impersonation.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.044
Well, maybe if they
tried scoring.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.745
Oh, for God's sakes!

01:10.945 --> 01:14.049
Well, what do you expect when your
star player's out with a leg injury?

01:14.073 --> 01:15.583
I thought it was a groin injury.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.960
Thank you for sharing, Bay.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.047
So, who's gonna come out
to cheer me on tonight?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.017
Laundry.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.718
I think there's a
math meet tonight.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.179
I gotta do my hair.

01:34.343 --> 01:37.448
Well, forget Rachel. Her
parents sent her to Utah.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.899
What's she doing
in Utah, skiing?

01:40.224 --> 01:41.160
Are you kidding?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.027
I've been looking all
over for you guys.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.122
They only care what
she's not doing.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.363
It's some kind of rehab.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.001
All right, if she's gone,
let's try Patricia.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.659
We bailed her brother out.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.870
Yeah.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.413
Give me a hint.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.675
It's just an incredible crisis.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.210
Patricia's little sister's
got the chicken pox.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.797
So we party on some
street corner.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.799
Please!

02:05.166 --> 02:07.426
Wait a minute. You
just need a place?

02:10.630 --> 02:11.889
I know a big house.

02:12.548 --> 02:16.487
Zero hassles. Total freedom.
Immediate occupancy.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.853
Are you kidding?

02:18.137 --> 02:19.397
Are you serious?

02:20.014 --> 02:21.524
You want to say 7:00?

02:25.686 --> 02:26.821
Hey, Kirsten.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.449
Oh, I got something for you.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.369
No big deal. Just something
I thought you could use.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.705
Sneaker cleaner.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.218
One spritz cleans a
sneaker right up.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.627
Wow. That's...

02:41.828 --> 02:42.962
That's great.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.431
You shouldn't have.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.716
Well, it's no big deal. We're doing
a promotion at the store, so...

02:47.750 --> 02:49.260
I get them pretty much free.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.679
Still very thoughtful.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.765
Listen, good luck
tonight at the game.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.685
You know, I was thinking,
maybe you should come.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.863
It's not much of an
athletic contest,

02:59.887 --> 03:02.022
but we're usually pretty
good for a laugh.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.317
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm...
kind of busy.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.444
Next game maybe?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.155
Yeah...

03:10.273 --> 03:12.074
If we're still alive
after tonight.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.243
Hey, Bay.

03:20.241 --> 03:23.011
Listen, uh, I got this idea.

03:23.035 --> 03:25.472
It says here there's a new
band tonight at the Armory.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.257
They're supposed to be
really hot, and, uh,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.301
I get off from the bar early.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.178
You free?

03:32.962 --> 03:34.648
There must be something
in the water.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.933
Suddenly, everybody's interested
in my social schedule.

03:38.342 --> 03:43.397
Actually, I've got two front-row
tickets to Liz Phair tonight.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.066
Okay, that's just as good.
We'll do that.

03:47.768 --> 03:49.236
I'm going with George.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.831
He got them through
his law firm.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.876
I can't believe you're
going out with a lawyer.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.161
I mean, isn't that kind
of buttoned-down for you?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.330
No.

03:59.488 --> 04:00.831
It's kind of perfect.

04:01.949 --> 04:04.168
The truth is, I owe
it all to you.

04:04.368 --> 04:06.879
If you hadn't bailed out on
me a couple of weeks ago,

04:07.496 --> 04:09.381
George and I might
have never hooked up.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.844
If I can bring one ray of
sunshine into your life...

04:18.341 --> 04:21.987
You know, I thought we had
something going, Charlie,

04:22.011 --> 04:24.980
but you kind of
weirded-out on me.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.150
I was trying to be a lot
nobler than I actually am.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.694
I'm not following you.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.280
Never mind. It'll
never happen again.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.491
You've gotta meet George.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.034
He's just...

04:38.486 --> 04:41.872
He does this pro bono program for
low-income housing residents.

04:42.406 --> 04:43.550
So far this year, they've...

04:43.574 --> 04:46.252
Hey, you know what? I think I
left the water running upstairs.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.796
Remember where you are.
We'll do this another time.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.758 --> 05:02.309
They're stronger than we are.

05:02.718 --> 05:04.603
They're faster than we are.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.605
They're bigger than we are.

05:07.556 --> 05:11.485
They're not missing three
of their starting players.

05:11.852 --> 05:14.206
They didn't skip three
days of practice

05:14.230 --> 05:17.032
because their field
was overfertilized.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.994
They didn't have that
stomach flu thing.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.748
Leaving that all behind...

05:26.242 --> 05:29.169
Out there, on that
field, it's just you.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.515
You and your team.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.268
Don't worry if our
cheerleaders nap

05:34.292 --> 05:38.188
or your... your family...
leaves early.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.139
You think about each other.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.360
You play to each
other's strengths.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.270
You... you help each other out!

05:46.762 --> 05:49.273
We are a team!

05:49.890 --> 05:52.109
Or we are nothing.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.404
Go, possums!

05:58.858 --> 06:00.034
Right.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.038
-This is a nice place.

06:05.322 --> 06:06.832
Pre-trashed!

06:06.949 --> 06:08.260
Cool.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.847
Julia, you said it was just the five
of you, right? There's no adults?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.765
My brother doesn't qualify.
Trust me.

06:13.789 --> 06:14.683
Okay.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.601
What's that... noise?

06:16.625 --> 06:19.011
That, that's just...

06:27.428 --> 06:29.948
Oh, Greg was gonna play
us his band's demo.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.242
Toe Jam. Have you heard of us?

06:32.266 --> 06:34.360
Uh-huh. Just a sec.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.205
Claud, can I see you in the other
room for a minute, please?

06:37.229 --> 06:38.582
I'm not done practicing my...

06:38.606 --> 06:39.823
Now.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.661
Could you do that upstairs?

06:44.695 --> 06:46.914
Acoustically,
downstairs is better.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.717
But there's nowhere else
for us to hang out.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.260
Hey, how high can we
crank the stereo?

06:50.284 --> 06:51.261
Crank it.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.753
Come on, Claud. Please?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.131
Okay, dishes for a week.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.343
Diaper changes for a month?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.347
I'll let you watch
an R-rated video.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.351
You know what I've been
thinking a lot about?

07:08.427 --> 07:09.853
Mom's quilt.

07:10.554 --> 07:11.939
The one on my bed?

07:12.932 --> 07:15.160
It'll really pull
my room together.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.735
Claud, you live in a tent.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.949
Fine, fine. It's yours.
Just do it upstairs.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.077
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.079
Upstairs.

07:27.988 --> 07:29.456
You got anything to eat?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.999
Kitchen's over there.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.543
Thanks, Judy.

07:32.868 --> 07:34.096
It's not Judy. It's...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.295
Julia,

07:35.913 --> 07:37.339
You're looking well.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.801
I'm here to spirit Kirsten away.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.847
Kirsten, it's George!

07:45.589 --> 07:46.724
George?

07:47.299 --> 07:48.485
Charlie Salinger.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.811
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.615
Great tie.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.065
What are those, little ducks?

07:58.436 --> 08:01.739
So, uh, Kirsten says
you build things.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.782
Shelves.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.421
Actually, I'm in the process of setting
up my own construction business.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.005
Mostly residential stuff.

08:09.029 --> 08:10.424
I did construction one summer.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.790
No kidding. What'd you build?

08:11.824 --> 08:14.960
A village in the Cameroon.
I was in the Peace Corps.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.088
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.392
You all set? You look great.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.759
Doesn't she look great?

08:23.377 --> 08:25.345
Well, we're off.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.357
See you in the morning, Charlie.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.515
Nice to meet you.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.188
Where's the Cameroon?

08:35.764 --> 08:37.357
Down the hall?

08:47.109 --> 08:48.670
The open field moves, man!

08:48.694 --> 08:50.162
The crucial block!

08:50.821 --> 08:52.674
Positive mission, my boys!

08:52.698 --> 08:54.416
Yeah!

08:54.492 --> 08:56.210
Whoo! Whoo!

08:57.620 --> 08:58.805
Like this?

08:58.829 --> 09:02.674
No, it's not just your back. You
really got to let yourself loose.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.314
I practically got trampled to
death with the Beastie Boys.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.231
Oh, really?

09:08.255 --> 09:09.441
It was totally cool.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.902
When you're this close to having
your skull crushed by a skinhead

09:11.926 --> 09:13.487
wearing a pair of Doc Martens,

09:13.511 --> 09:15.238
you know you're alive on
the planet, you know?

09:15.262 --> 09:16.438
Uh-huh.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.693
He's cute.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.946
He's yours. Go for it, babe.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.074
So... who are you
going out with?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.618
Nobody much.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.080
"Nobody much?" I
dated him last year.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.666
Oh, believe me, you can
do much better than him.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.678
You know who'd be
perfect for you?

09:38.702 --> 09:39.638
Porter.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.349
Oh, Porter Stanley. He's from St.
Ignatius.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.341
Yeah, he's in Greg's band.
He's so great.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.560
You think so?

09:45.584 --> 09:48.438
One day, you know, you can
just swing by rehearsal,

09:48.462 --> 09:50.222
and I'll casually
introduce you guys.

09:51.006 --> 09:52.108
That'd be great.

09:52.132 --> 09:53.392
Thanks.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.894
Well, you know, just
name the kids after me.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.908
Great game, Bay.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.951
Thanks, man.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.526
See you guys later.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.290
Missed you out there
tonight, bro.

10:07.314 --> 10:09.741
Just wanted to say you
were studly tonight.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.463
So, you want to go
out, celebrate?

10:13.487 --> 10:14.872
Oh, I'll catch you tomorrow.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.583
I got a heavy date
with an ice pack.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.837
Don't ask me to autograph it.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.558
Guess we screwed up your
winning record, huh?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.174
What'd you say, punk?

10:26.333 --> 10:27.467
Hey!

10:27.751 --> 10:29.854
Just keep it on the field. Keep
it on the field, all right?

10:29.878 --> 10:31.565
- Think you're tough, now huh?
- Now he's scared.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.441
Hey, give me a break, man.
It's just a game!

10:33.465 --> 10:35.142
What the hell's
your problem, man?

10:40.472 --> 10:41.575
Let's get out of here, man.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.576
Let's go!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.568
Let's get out of here!

10:47.229 --> 10:48.488
Damn it!

10:48.981 --> 10:50.407
Salinger, who was it?

10:52.526 --> 10:53.461
Who was it?

10:53.485 --> 10:54.870
I don't know.

10:55.195 --> 10:56.622
I didn't see anything.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.540
I don't know.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.680
The receiver doesn't
know I'm behind him.

11:13.881 --> 11:17.235
The quarterback never sees me, so
he lofts this beautiful pass...

11:17.259 --> 11:18.278
Interception, right?

11:18.302 --> 11:19.821
Excuse me. You tied, right?

11:19.845 --> 11:21.813
No food in the entire house.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.158
So my friends have appetites.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.409
I want to hear Bailey.

11:24.433 --> 11:28.028
I grab the ball, I look downfield,
all the lanes are blocked...

11:28.103 --> 11:29.247
Just tell me, is this it...

11:29.271 --> 11:31.365
Stewed apricots and
strained peas?

11:31.523 --> 11:33.209
Fine. So I'll shop.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.127
Finish the story.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.254
All right, so I'm flying
toward the end zone...

11:36.278 --> 11:37.505
The seven-seven tie.

11:37.529 --> 11:39.174
I see the quarterback
trying to make the angle.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.675
Hello. This is Charlie Salinger.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.052
Adam comes out of nowhere...

11:42.076 --> 11:44.429
This is the most pathetic thing I
have ever heard. You didn't win.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.805
- What happened?
- They tied.

11:45.829 --> 11:47.464
Principal Stickley's office?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.466
Today?

11:51.210 --> 11:54.888
I'm sorry. I don't know anything
about an incident last night.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.146
Great, Bailey. This
is just great.

12:03.263 --> 12:06.191
How was I supposed to know they'd
make such a big deal out of this?

12:06.767 --> 12:08.244
I was supposed to bid
on a job this morning,

12:08.268 --> 12:11.822
and now, through absolutely no fault of
my own, I'm gonna end up looking bad.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.699
Charlie Salinger!

12:14.691 --> 12:16.993
You didn't set fire to the
boys' room again, did you?

12:17.277 --> 12:18.870
Hey, Mr. Harlan.

12:22.741 --> 12:26.596
Oh, my goodness. If it
isn't Charlie Salinger.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.139
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

12:28.163 --> 12:32.718
We still talk about you drilling that
peephole in the girls' locker room.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.557
I did it for Bob Grenley.
I owed him money.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.811
My point is, you should be paying
attention to those grades of yours.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.523
This better be the last time
I get dragged down here.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.818
Principal Stickley will be with
you boys in a few minutes.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.906
Charlie, seeing you here
makes me feel young again.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.297
Aren't you hot like that?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.048
Not too.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.051
Did you ever have English with Mr.
May?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.896
Yeah, he's a good teacher.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.982
Last year we read <i>To
Kill A Mockingbird.</i>

13:19.006 --> 13:20.348
I think he likes me.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.642
He winked at me the other day.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.447
He winks at Coach Ryan, too.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.574
It's a twitch. It happens
when he's tired.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.491
Oh.

13:28.515 --> 13:30.358
Hey, Julia, you're a brain.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.819
Tell me how I can get
an "A" out of Ferguson?

13:33.812 --> 13:36.291
Take good notes. He's
real big on extra credit.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.450
No. I meant an easy way.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.754
Well, it might mean doing
some homework sometime.

13:41.778 --> 13:45.540
Hey, I will have you know I happen
to be very into social studies.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.292
Emphasis on "social."

13:48.827 --> 13:50.879
Last night was so much fun.

13:51.538 --> 13:53.840
Is your place available
again tonight?

13:55.542 --> 13:56.718
My place?

13:57.669 --> 13:59.387
Sure. Great.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.515
Cool. That's wonderful.

14:10.557 --> 14:12.150
Look, Miss Stickley...

14:12.935 --> 14:14.194
God bless you.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.665
If, uh... if Bailey says he didn't
see anything, I'm sure he didn't.

14:17.689 --> 14:18.907
And even if I did...

14:20.025 --> 14:21.618
It wasn't our guys' fault.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.297
The other team, they were kind of
pissed off about the tie, you know?

14:24.321 --> 14:27.082
They sort of expected to win.
They started it.

14:27.282 --> 14:31.262
The Havenhurst principal will
deal with the Havenhurst players.

14:31.286 --> 14:32.712
I'll deal with mine.

14:32.871 --> 14:36.091
Yeah, but, you got to understand that
when a teammate gets pushed around,

14:36.124 --> 14:38.019
you got to push back.
Even Coach would...

14:38.043 --> 14:42.097
I am not interested in your
justifications, Mr. Salinger.

14:44.424 --> 14:45.684
No, ma'am.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.520
School property was destroyed.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.365
A car was vandalized.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.409
Visiting players were attacked
on our school grounds.

14:53.433 --> 14:56.486
Alcohol, beer bottles
were found at the scene.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.207
Obviously, some members
of this team think

14:59.231 --> 15:01.334
that just because they
wear a football jersey,

15:01.358 --> 15:04.661
they have license to act
any way they please.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.996
They're wrong.

15:07.239 --> 15:13.086
And if you think, Mr. Salinger, that you
can protect your friends with your silence

15:13.120 --> 15:17.090
and laugh at the authority of
this school, and at my authority,

15:17.916 --> 15:19.102
you're wrong.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.728
Either you tell us who
broke the windows,

15:20.752 --> 15:22.679
or you'll be suspended
from the team.

15:24.756 --> 15:26.850
<i>Maybe he can sue the
school board or something.</i>

15:27.342 --> 15:29.811
You hear about that kind of stuff
happening all the time, don't you?

15:30.137 --> 15:31.479
I guess.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.202
When I was a senior, we had
this dress code hassle.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.819
How'd we deal with that?

15:39.646 --> 15:42.073
Oh. We lost. That's how.

15:44.651 --> 15:46.578
There's a way to
handle these people.

15:49.489 --> 15:51.791
Not that I have the
slightest clue what it is.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.336
You mind?

15:54.494 --> 15:55.962
I skipped lunch.

16:02.669 --> 16:03.813
Hey.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.723
I know somebody who'd know all
about this kind of stuff,

16:07.174 --> 16:10.644
who'd know exactly if there were
any legal angle worth pursuing.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.063
George.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.191
George?

16:17.684 --> 16:18.870
Uh-huh.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.153
Sure.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.405
I know he'd be happy to
help you out, Charlie.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.698
Really.

16:29.237 --> 16:30.664
Did you buy tuna?

16:31.531 --> 16:32.926
Come on, Claud.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.209
Here.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.099
Gummi bears are not
in the food pyramid.

16:40.123 --> 16:42.425
So? Order pizza. Just
eat it upstairs, okay?

16:43.543 --> 16:44.979
You're having another party.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.471
I know, Claudia.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.140
This is not just your
house, you know.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.475
We share it.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.769
You could ask us first.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.479
It's called being polite.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.233
May I have another
party, Claudia?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.656
Maybe I should just...
disappear.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.617
You know, never to
be heard from again?

17:15.784 --> 17:17.011
These the good kind?

17:17.035 --> 17:18.252
Yeah.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.967
You don't understand yet.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.760
You will when you're older.

17:26.920 --> 17:31.558
You know, you meet new friends, and you
want to have them over, have parties,

17:31.967 --> 17:33.518
do crazy things.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.104
You meet new people, you
want them to like you.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.148
It's fun.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.649
It's important.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.485
It's just... important.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.240
You'll see in a few years.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.410
Can I have a red one?

17:51.486 --> 17:52.662
Sure.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.131
I'd like to see George Lewis.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.175
I didn't make an appointment.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.052
All right.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.474
Is he a lawyer?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.934
He's the greatest
lawyer in the universe.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.353
Hmm.

18:20.515 --> 18:21.775
Oh.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.194
He's not a lawyer.
He's a paralegal.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.113
They're two floors down,
with the steno pool.

18:28.815 --> 18:30.200
Should I buzz him?

18:35.155 --> 18:36.539
It's open.

18:40.368 --> 18:41.544
Hey.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.296
Where is everybody?

18:43.413 --> 18:44.547
It's just us.

18:45.082 --> 18:48.218
Great. I mean, welcome.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.848
Wait a second. Did
you invite anybody?

18:54.674 --> 18:55.651
No.

18:55.675 --> 18:56.652
That's great.

18:56.676 --> 18:58.404
- It is?
- Yeah.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.897
Last night was just so awesome.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.191
But tonight, I don't know.

19:03.266 --> 19:05.693
We just wanted someplace quiet.

19:06.394 --> 19:08.571
God, you're such a
lifesaver, Jul.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.877
Well, you know, since it's just
the five of us, we could go out.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.911
It's open-mike night
at Grounds 4.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.997
I don't know about that.

19:18.573 --> 19:20.125
You really want to do that?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.710
Not if you don't want to.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.130
Well... I don't know...

19:26.706 --> 19:28.591
It's hard to find a
place like this.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.935
Did you hear Mount Tam
got a new linebacker?

19:38.969 --> 19:42.689
Some transfer student from...
get this... Samoa.

19:43.306 --> 19:44.566
Yeah, so?

19:44.724 --> 19:46.693
Yeah, so, Samoans are huge.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.696
They're like Amazons.
We're, like, screwed.

19:50.021 --> 19:52.699
They beat Urban last
week, 47 to zip.

19:53.316 --> 19:54.868
Did you hear about
this guy, Bay?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.956
I wonder what it feels like to get
sacked by a 240-pound Samoan.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.624
You'll know next Saturday.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.502
Not necessarily.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.297
I blew off Stickley
and the Coach today.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.090
What do you mean?

20:09.624 --> 20:11.509
You said you didn't
see anything, right?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.181
If I don't tell who did it, the said
they're gonna kick me off the team.

20:16.923 --> 20:18.734
So they don't even
care who started it?

20:18.758 --> 20:19.976
Right.

20:20.468 --> 20:21.529
You're kidding!

20:21.553 --> 20:23.062
That's what they said.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.856
Don't let them scare you, Bay.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.150
Do I have a choice about that?

20:28.059 --> 20:30.028
They're just talking
tough so you'll squeal.

20:30.353 --> 20:31.738
I don't think so, man.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.448
They sounded serious.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.575
I'm telling you,
Salinger, it's an act.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.336
Coach knows you
didn't do anything.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.953
He knows you didn't
break that window.

20:39.237 --> 20:42.081
You think he's gonna kick you off the team
when he knows you didn't do anything?

20:43.283 --> 20:45.960
So you're saying that protecting
your butt is a safe move?

20:46.745 --> 20:49.599
I gotta say, Bay, my
butt's completely safe,

20:49.623 --> 20:51.424
and it sounds right to me.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.053
You really think it's a bluff?

20:56.463 --> 20:58.608
They're not looking to
bust the guy who saw it.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.266
They're looking to bust
the guy who did it.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.810
We gotta stick together, man.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.104
If we're not a team,
then we're nothing.

21:12.103 --> 21:15.865
Well, anyway, they can't prove
I saw who did it, right?

21:16.149 --> 21:17.450
Damn straight.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.453
You're my hero, man.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.673
Yeah.

21:22.697 --> 21:24.707
It's an awesome responsibility.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.018
I'm sorry. You
probably want to...

21:34.042 --> 21:35.760
I'll just... I'll make...

21:36.336 --> 21:38.054
I'll leave. I'm gone.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.531
I can't just sit on the
sidelines again this week, Bay.

21:47.555 --> 21:51.077
We're on a roll here. I mean, a tie.
Huh? A tie!

21:51.101 --> 21:52.119
It's a mistake, man.

21:52.143 --> 21:54.580
You'll get hurt worse and we'll lose
you for the rest of the season.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.539
What good will that do?

21:55.563 --> 21:56.739
Hey!

21:59.442 --> 22:01.327
What the hell you think
you're doing, Salinger?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.839
I'm suiting up for
practice, Coach.

22:03.863 --> 22:07.750
Salinger, you're not practicing with this
team until we've resolved this situation.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.806
Coach, I told you, I
didn't see anything.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.216
Really? Do you see this?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.064
Pesto.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.764
I'm making pesto.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.935
You don't mind, do you? I know
it's not in my job description.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.479
George is crazy about pesto.

22:29.472 --> 22:32.066
Don't worry. I'll save
you guys a batch.

22:32.892 --> 22:34.944
Hey, I keep meaning to ask,

22:35.270 --> 22:37.488
did you ever talk to him
about Bailey's situation?

22:38.273 --> 22:39.667
Actually, Kirsten...

22:39.691 --> 22:41.043
You should catch him
before Friday, though,

22:41.067 --> 22:43.119
because we're planning to
go to Napa this weekend,

22:43.695 --> 22:47.040
although he's so swamped with his
cases, we might have to put it off.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.753
Say, Kirsten, you ever
been down to his office?

22:51.911 --> 22:53.087
Not yet.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.799
He is so not into being in one
of those huge skyscrapers.

22:57.083 --> 23:00.636
Did you know that you can't even open a
window in the Transamerica building?

23:02.338 --> 23:04.891
Where did George go to law school?
Did he ever say?

23:05.633 --> 23:06.976
Boalt, was it?

23:07.510 --> 23:10.021
One of the UCs, I think.
I'm not sure.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.399
He must really be pushing
to make partner.

23:14.684 --> 23:18.071
He's not into practicing
corporate law.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.198
He'd much rather
do legal aid work.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.785
I personally think he has a
future ahead of him in politics.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.371
He's certainly got the
character for it.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.582
What's that supposed to mean?

23:31.242 --> 23:34.128
Kirsten, he's not a lawyer.

23:35.038 --> 23:38.309
What are you talking about? He's been at
Dunn and MacLean for the past three years.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.594
As a paralegal. A
paralegal, not a lawyer.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.232
How do you know?

23:45.256 --> 23:47.850
Because I took your advice and I
went to see him at his office.

23:48.134 --> 23:52.688
The receptionist referred me to the paralegal
department, next to the steno pool.

23:52.847 --> 23:54.399
He's been lying to you.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.567
No.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.444
He told me that he...

24:00.355 --> 24:01.906
Why would he lie?

24:03.108 --> 24:06.077
To get a woman like you, most
guys would say anything.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.707
Look, could you just...

24:11.866 --> 24:13.501
I just need to, um...

24:13.952 --> 24:18.641
<i>♪ No matter what I say
It seems I lose ♪</i>

24:18.665 --> 24:19.642
See you later, Matt.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.426
All right, man, we'll
catch up with you later.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.898
Hey, we got to talk.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.691
Hey, where were you today?
Why weren't you at practice?

24:27.715 --> 24:28.943
Because Coach
wouldn't let me in,

24:28.967 --> 24:30.778
because they're gonna
suspend me, that's why.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.947
Oh, no, they're not, man. I'm telling
you, you didn't do anything.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.031
Look, would you
stop saying that?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.898
I'm telling you, they're
not backing off.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.868
Hey, get a grip, man.

24:37.892 --> 24:40.329
- All right? Just get a grip.
- That's easy for you to say.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.581
I'm the one who's gonna get
nailed for what you did.

24:42.605 --> 24:45.209
Oh, come on, it wasn't my fault.
You saw what happened.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.742
It wasn't my fault.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.704
Look, man, it's tough.
I know, all right?

24:49.737 --> 24:51.298
But, believe me, I'd
be there for you.

24:51.322 --> 24:52.457
What?

24:52.615 --> 24:54.844
If the situation was
reversed, I'd cover for you.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.502
You wouldn't have to.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.922
What's happening here, man?

25:00.540 --> 25:01.475
We're a team.

25:01.499 --> 25:04.343
Don't you understand? I'm
gonna be off the team.

25:04.586 --> 25:08.149
What do you want me to do? What, you
want me to tell them I broke the window?

25:08.173 --> 25:11.058
You want me to screw myself over?
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.352
Do something.

25:15.763 --> 25:17.023
You're crazy.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.275
You want to fight?

25:21.436 --> 25:22.945
You coward.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.072
What are you gonna do, huh?

25:25.940 --> 25:27.492
You gonna just cave in?

25:27.609 --> 25:29.911
You gonna just save your butt,
and tell them everything?

25:31.029 --> 25:33.206
I don't think you
want to do that, man.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.666
Are you threatening me?

25:36.159 --> 25:39.045
No, go ahead, man.
Rat on your team.

25:39.495 --> 25:41.672
I'm sure the guys are
really gonna trust you.

25:48.671 --> 25:50.399
The third movement's
very tricky,

25:50.423 --> 25:53.226
because it's got those
trills in fourth position,

25:53.384 --> 25:54.904
but Ross says that
if I work on it...

25:54.928 --> 25:56.238
Hold still.

25:56.262 --> 25:57.448
You seen my blue shirt?

25:57.472 --> 25:58.407
No.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.658
Cut them straight
for once, will you?

25:59.682 --> 26:02.077
Look, Claud, trust me, okay?
I've got it down.

26:02.101 --> 26:03.319
Okay.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.071
Ew. Gross.

26:05.855 --> 26:06.916
You're disgusting.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.292
Come on, we're gonna
be late for dinner.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.202
Like Joe's gonna give away our table?
I don't think so.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.204
Two minutes, I'm leaving,
with or without you.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.832
- You expecting someone?
- No.

26:17.825 --> 26:19.168
She's such a flake.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.180
How many people did
you and Abby invite?

26:21.204 --> 26:22.505
Just a few.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.724
Julia.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.217
But when people hear
it's a happening place,

26:26.834 --> 26:28.938
word of mouth can
be pretty awesome.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.689
Okay, enough is
enough here, Julia.

26:30.713 --> 26:34.684
Look, I told people BYOB, so it's not
like you're gonna run out of stuff.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.488
The thing is, Nina, we were
kind of heading out to dinner.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.323
But you're gonna miss
something really amazing.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.983
I told Greg to invite that
guy from his band, Porter.

26:42.058 --> 26:45.903
Here's an idea, what do you say we toss
everyone the hell out and lock the damn door?

26:46.396 --> 26:47.738
He's kidding, right?

26:48.106 --> 26:49.615
You can't do that.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.410
I would be so
incredibly embarrassed.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.205
I can't believe Abby
didn't call you.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.082
Julia.

27:33.776 --> 27:34.795
Bailey!

27:34.819 --> 27:35.754
Bailey!

27:35.778 --> 27:37.747
What the hell's going on here?

27:37.864 --> 27:40.634
They're in my bedroom.
They're in the bathroom.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.377
They're in the shower. They
spilled something on my sheets.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.671
They broke my lava lamp.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.849
You blew off dinner.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.841
Would you leave
these maniacs here?

27:49.500 --> 27:50.843
Hey!

27:51.044 --> 27:53.179
Hey, they're in the kitchen.
Get your own.

27:54.088 --> 27:55.389
Come on, Bay.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.028
Is Owen asleep?

27:59.052 --> 28:00.237
Could you?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.562
We got to put him to bed.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.148
Where do you suggest,
the wall safe?

28:08.770 --> 28:10.821
There's someone
smoking in my tent.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.660
It's going to smell
like an airport.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.839
We'll air it out. You can
sleep in my room tonight.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.051
Someone threw up in your room.
It smells worse in there.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.626
This is so great.

28:23.701 --> 28:26.347
Sorry again about Nina and I
getting our signals crossed.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.381
I swear she said she'd call.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.725
It's okay.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.436
No, it's not. It's not okay.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.313
Look, leave me alone.
Everyone's having fun.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.639
I'm not. You're not.
That's not everyone.

28:40.843 --> 28:42.196
What do you want me to do?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.989
Duh. Kick everyone out.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.324
Claudia, they're my friends.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.451
Well, my friends wouldn't
treat me like this.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.994
What do you know? You're 11.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.205
Your friends don't even have
parties, and if they did,

28:51.229 --> 28:53.447
they'd probably just sit around
listening to nerdy music.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.199
So what if they did?

28:55.483 --> 28:58.754
It's better than your friends
treating you like a dumb waitress,

28:58.778 --> 29:01.330
coming over here without
even being invited,

29:01.489 --> 29:05.292
spilling stuff everywhere, and not leaving
so you can have dinner with your family.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.963
If they were real friends, they
wouldn't act like this to begin with.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.599
You wouldn't have
to kick them out.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.351
I can't kick them out.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.592
Well, why not?

29:15.169 --> 29:16.595
Because they'll think...

29:18.047 --> 29:19.348
They'll think that...

29:25.304 --> 29:27.282
Why don't you just give
them the keys to the house

29:27.306 --> 29:28.450
and lie down in
front of the door

29:28.474 --> 29:30.818
so they can just walk
all over you, huh?

29:41.279 --> 29:43.456
Jeez, the whole
place is vibrating.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.543
What's with you?

29:56.085 --> 29:57.636
I was gonna put that in.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.023
What's with you?

30:00.047 --> 30:03.110
What are you talking about?
There's beer in our bathtub.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.445
There's a boom-box
in the freezer.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.396
I can't get up and down the
stairs in my own house.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.567
I'm gonna get kicked
off the football team.

30:14.353 --> 30:15.873
I thought you had
that figured out.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.656
Yeah, well, I got
it wrong, okay?

30:18.107 --> 30:21.035
They're not playing games.
Either I talk, or I'm gone.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.207
Doesn't sound to me like
you have much choice.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.459
What, you think I should talk?

30:28.743 --> 30:29.678
Yeah.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.921
I don't know. It doesn't
feel right, man.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.682
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.

30:33.706 --> 30:37.134
Look, don't give me
a lecture, okay?

30:37.335 --> 30:39.345
Maybe you want to think
about the future.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.305
Oh, like you always do?

30:41.339 --> 30:42.524
Huh, Charlie?

30:42.548 --> 30:45.142
This is going on your
permanent record, you know.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.113
What happens when the
college recruiters come by,

30:48.137 --> 30:50.282
when it comes time to give out
the football scholarships?

30:50.306 --> 30:52.326
Chances are, I'm not
getting any scholarships.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.702
Yeah, but you could.

30:53.726 --> 30:57.122
Know how much money that is? Know how
much easier that would make things on us?

30:57.146 --> 30:58.415
Or maybe you're not
thinking about that.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.250
Maybe you're just thinking
about whatever feels right.

31:00.274 --> 31:01.418
What do you want from me?

31:01.442 --> 31:03.077
I want you to grow up!

31:03.486 --> 31:04.870
Try being a man.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.541
I want you to think about
protecting your future.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.377
You have to, Bay. Who else
is gonna do it for you?

31:18.751 --> 31:22.638
I'm here for you guys now, but...
I'm not Dad,

31:23.256 --> 31:25.734
and I'm not spending the rest of my
life pouring drinks behind a bar,

31:25.758 --> 31:27.351
making money to take care of you

31:27.510 --> 31:29.854
not while you go off and
do whatever feels right.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.148
It's not fair.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.826
Hey, man, throw me a towel.

31:49.782 --> 31:53.043
I, uh... I need to talk to you.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.129
I would say so.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.307
You gonna give the
Gettysburg Address, son?

32:06.465 --> 32:07.683
No.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.061
It's just...

32:12.179 --> 32:13.480
I just...

32:16.309 --> 32:18.110
I wanted you to understand...

32:20.897 --> 32:24.366
To understand why I can't tell
you who smashed the window,

32:24.942 --> 32:27.379
and it's not just because
of what you said about how

32:27.403 --> 32:29.371
either we're a team
or we're nothing,

32:30.990 --> 32:32.333
though that's true.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.337
It's just that...

32:36.537 --> 32:40.976
I don't think it's right to ask
anyone to turn in a teammate.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.094
I mean, not when I don't
think what he did was wrong.

32:45.296 --> 32:49.308
And I know you have the power to make an example
out of me, but that doesn't make it right.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.852
I mean, kick me off the team?
That's just...

32:55.264 --> 32:56.482
See...

32:57.850 --> 33:00.037
I don't understand how
you could tell me

33:00.061 --> 33:04.156
that the only way for me to stay out of
trouble is to be a traitor to my friends.

33:05.691 --> 33:08.994
Because if I do
that, if I am that,

33:11.822 --> 33:14.041
then I couldn't go back
to the team anyway.

33:19.121 --> 33:21.173
So I can't turn anybody in.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.176
I just...

33:25.336 --> 33:27.221
I just really hope
you understand.

33:40.643 --> 33:41.662
Good morning.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.862
Not really, and I don't
want to discuss it.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.706
You were right.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.342
George is not a lawyer.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.886
He did lie to me, which
is pretty stupid, right?

33:57.910 --> 33:59.420
Because I really liked him.

34:00.621 --> 34:01.964
It wouldn't have mattered.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.552
And he tried to explain.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.264
He swore he was going
to tell me but,

34:10.630 --> 34:11.849
I just...

34:13.259 --> 34:14.976
I can't start out that way.

34:16.344 --> 34:18.230
So it's over. I ended it.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.232
I'm sorry.

34:21.183 --> 34:22.202
Are you?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.360
Yeah.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.998
I know it's tough. If
you want to talk...

34:27.023 --> 34:29.033
Oh, you're full of crap,
Charlie, you know that?

34:29.984 --> 34:31.201
You're sorry?

34:31.235 --> 34:33.120
You care that I'm hurt?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.755
Yes. I just told you that.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.831
You think I can't
see through you?

34:37.491 --> 34:39.636
I know exactly
what you're doing.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.638
George is out, and
you're in, right?

34:41.661 --> 34:42.723
I didn't say that.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.505
Tell me it isn't true.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.717
Tell me that you weren't
glad when you found out.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.688
The way you led me through
those questions...

34:49.712 --> 34:52.399
"You ever been to his firm? Seen
his office?" That was fun, huh?

34:52.422 --> 34:55.016
Hey, I was just pointing out
how little you knew him.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.195
I thought I was protecting
you from getting hurt worse.

34:57.219 --> 34:58.645
Don't put this on me.

35:03.225 --> 35:05.235
I don't think you care about me.

35:05.644 --> 35:07.363
I think you care about you.

35:08.230 --> 35:11.867
I think you're playing a game, and
I am so sick of games right now.

35:12.151 --> 35:13.869
Well, okay.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.214
I'd kind of like the
chance to defend myself.

35:16.238 --> 35:18.248
You know what? No.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.084
I don't want to hear anymore.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.669
You're no better than he is.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.132
Here.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.762
Don't drink that water.
It's horrible.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.848
I'm dead anyway.
What's the difference?

35:37.635 --> 35:39.853
Aspirin wouldn't help. Thanks.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.118
Talk about dead, we
killed my house.

35:45.142 --> 35:47.736
Then tell your house
I know how it feels.

35:48.270 --> 35:50.582
So, basically, maybe
we need another place.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.990
Look at me.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.201
You guys have any Visine?

35:54.485 --> 35:59.081
I am so looking forward to gym
right now, I can't even tell you.

36:00.157 --> 36:01.834
So no more surprise
parties, okay?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.794
What is she talking about?

36:04.411 --> 36:05.963
What are you talking about?

36:08.415 --> 36:11.686
Come on, you guys, there was so
much food stamped into the rug,

36:11.710 --> 36:13.679
you could serve it
in the cafeteria,

36:14.547 --> 36:16.682
and you should've
seen the bathrooms,

36:17.091 --> 36:18.568
and I heard this guy
in the kitchen,

36:18.592 --> 36:20.070
on the phone,
calling New Jersey,

36:20.094 --> 36:22.114
and no one in my family seems
to be talking to me right now,

36:22.138 --> 36:23.772
I know this sounds stupid,

36:24.723 --> 36:26.483
but someone broke my
brother's lava lamp.

36:28.310 --> 36:29.862
He has a lava lamp?

36:30.604 --> 36:32.406
Isn't that kind of passe?

36:32.731 --> 36:34.241
Why didn't you say something?

36:35.025 --> 36:36.086
I am.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.327
Now.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.830
Now I am.

36:40.656 --> 36:41.716
Oh.

36:41.740 --> 36:42.875
Okay.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.543
So now we know.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.841
Wait. I'm not mad.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.980
Just... does it have to
be my house all the time?

36:55.004 --> 36:58.849
Oh, forget it. We don't
have to do anything.

36:59.425 --> 37:03.645
God! Now I am really
looking forward to gym.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.453
Got some ID?

37:24.575 --> 37:25.834
I'm off the team.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.186
I know you think I'm an idiot.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.353
Forget it, Bay.

37:35.377 --> 37:38.096
Not much point in talking about it.
You did what you did.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.224
I couldn't turn in a friend.

37:41.508 --> 37:43.195
You didn't hear a word I said.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.572
That's not true. I did hear
what you said to me last night.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.772
Sure.

37:48.265 --> 37:50.150
I just couldn't figure out how,

37:51.101 --> 37:54.154
when you told me to grow up
and be an adult for once,

37:54.897 --> 37:57.125
I couldn't figure out how
the first thing I would do

37:57.149 --> 37:59.117
would be to do something
I knew was wrong.

37:59.693 --> 38:00.994
I couldn't.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.416
The only thing is, I feel
really bad about this.

38:08.410 --> 38:10.087
I mean, I feel really horrible.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.512
See, the thing is,

38:19.546 --> 38:21.598
it would be great
if I thought that

38:22.341 --> 38:23.976
you at least understood.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.563
I mean, it would help.

38:31.558 --> 38:32.744
Bailey...

38:32.768 --> 38:33.986
Forget it.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.779
It doesn't matter.

38:39.316 --> 38:41.118
I know it isn't fair to you.

38:42.736 --> 38:46.123
See, the thing that I really
want to say is that...

38:48.450 --> 38:50.085
It's not your responsibility.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.546
I'm not.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.841
So don't worry about it, okay?

38:57.376 --> 38:58.969
I'll take care of myself.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.097
Whatever happens,
I'll handle it.

39:11.473 --> 39:12.774
You hungry?

39:14.852 --> 39:15.986
Yeah.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.655
We got some lentil soup,
the kind you like.

39:20.649 --> 39:21.867
Great.

39:22.901 --> 39:24.202
Hey, Isaac,

39:24.320 --> 39:26.371
how about getting some soup
over here for my brother?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.388
Claud.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.682
What?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.769
Look, I was here first.

39:49.094 --> 39:50.447
If you got a problem
with that...

39:50.471 --> 39:51.688
You're flat.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.441
What?

39:55.059 --> 39:57.110
Your e-string, it sounds flat.

40:05.778 --> 40:06.953
See?

40:15.746 --> 40:16.806
Better?

40:16.830 --> 40:18.048
Much.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.883
Go on. It sounded good.

40:21.668 --> 40:23.688
Wait'll you hear the
third movement.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.055
It's killer.

40:37.142 --> 40:38.527
Keep going.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.787
Hi.

40:49.321 --> 40:50.455
Hi...

40:52.032 --> 40:53.291
Um...

40:54.952 --> 40:56.712
My dad's a photographer,

40:57.329 --> 41:03.301
and he found this lava lamp
at a prop house for me.

41:06.171 --> 41:08.890
I think Bailey will
be really happy.

41:10.592 --> 41:13.228
Um, Abby can be kind
of mean sometimes...

41:13.429 --> 41:16.064
And I can be kind of out of it.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.362
So sometimes it's good to tell
people where to get off, you know,

41:23.230 --> 41:26.032
especially stupid people who
aren't paying attention.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.661
I'm sorry about the house.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.507
I should've said
something before.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.707
I just, um,

41:34.366 --> 41:36.418
I was worried that
you guys would...

41:36.660 --> 41:38.837
So we'll use someone
else's house.

41:39.538 --> 41:42.424
Hey, Lisa's parents will be
in the Bahamas all next week.

41:42.499 --> 41:43.842
Vacation?

41:44.334 --> 41:45.510
Divorce.

41:48.255 --> 41:51.641
Um, you want to go get
some coffee or something?

41:53.802 --> 41:55.896
I should probably
hang around here.

41:56.430 --> 41:57.898
Oh, okay.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.276
Well, see you later.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.538
Actually, do...

42:03.562 --> 42:06.031
Do you want to see
something pretty amazing?

42:25.751 --> 42:26.811
Hey,

42:26.835 --> 42:28.053
Kirsten.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.305
How long you been
standing there?

42:31.381 --> 42:32.808
Are you okay?

42:33.467 --> 42:34.810
Sure.

42:35.302 --> 42:38.198
Every man in the world is
a selfish, lying bastard.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.523
Life goes on.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.275
I know.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.621
Why don't I take a walk?

42:44.645 --> 42:45.821
Sit down.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.908
You may be the exception.

42:52.110 --> 42:53.954
I heard you did a
great thing today.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.373
You mean about the team?

42:57.741 --> 42:59.584
I don't know.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.138
I mean, when you
do a great thing,

43:02.162 --> 43:03.922
aren't you supposed
to feel great?

43:05.165 --> 43:07.384
All I know is you stuck
to your principles.

43:08.126 --> 43:10.136
That takes a lot of guts.

43:13.382 --> 43:16.351
You are incredibly
brave and unselfish,

43:16.969 --> 43:18.770
and I think you're wonderful.
