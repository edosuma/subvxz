doing with my bandana?

Just routine. She found
a little blood on it.

when you get Ricky'’s, like,

14:34.438 --> 14:36.919
you won'’t say anything
about why you need it?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.312
ROOK:
We can use his toothbrush

14:38.355 --> 14:40.357
or a comb, ma'’am. He
won'’t even have to know.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.142
Mm-hmm.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.756
Okay.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.638
MALE VOICE: No one'’s here
right now, so leave a message.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.554
Leland, it'’s Bud Carl.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.166
Uh, I promised I'’d call
and I'’m calling.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.299
I got some good news.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.953
Donny.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.389
Bud Carl.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.652
Gonna let you go.
I promised I'’d call you back

15:14.696 --> 15:16.176
if there was something for you.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.091
There'’s something
for you, so, uh,

15:18.134 --> 15:21.268
give me a call,
come by, all right?

15:30.625 --> 15:33.497
JENNY: What did the
guys look like?

15:33.541 --> 15:35.847
They didn'’t.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.546
They had something
over their faces.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.896
They just tied you
up and left you?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.420
You could'’ve died.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.988
Yeah, I thought about that.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.318
Here we go.

16:31.642 --> 16:35.037
Doing good?
Is she doing good?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.908
You want to go play
with your friends?

16:36.952 --> 16:38.780
Go ahead. Go play
with the other girls. Go on.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.303
You girls okay?

16:40.347 --> 16:41.609
Yeah. Uh...

16:41.652 --> 16:44.699
I don'’t really know
who to talk to. Um...

16:44.742 --> 16:48.703
We'’re worried about someone
who was here once, a baby.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.836
A baby?
Can you show
her the picture?

16:58.060 --> 17:00.758
Oh, my gosh.That'’s Carrie.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.412
Uh, who are you to her?

17:02.456 --> 17:05.589
I, uh, I babysit for her.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.331
She'’s with her dad now,
right outside of Pittsburgh.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.159
She'’s back with her dad?

17:10.203 --> 17:11.508
You'’re right.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.381
You'’re right
to be worried.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.909
So you haven'’t even talked
to him since all that?

17:20.952 --> 17:22.737
Tried a couple times, but
he never called me back.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.608
I mean, not that he ever
did before, you know.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.741
He never even set up his
voice mail, the jagoff, so...

17:26.784 --> 17:29.570
But you don'’t think he could've
had something to do with it?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.572
Nobody'’s ever borrowed that
bandanna, so that blood

17:31.615 --> 17:33.269
is either mine
or it'’s Ricky's.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.402
And if it'’s mine, then
we'’re probably talking about

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
that fuckup of a
brother of mine.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.841
But if it'’s Ricky's, then,
I mean, I don'’t even...

17:39.884 --> 17:41.495
I don'’t even know what
what we'’re talking about.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.105
COOPER:
Mom, we'’re starving.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.412
Can we have a snack?TERRI: No, we got
snacks at home.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.109
Come on. Thanks for letting
me park him here.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.677
No, why don'’t you
leave him here for a while?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.505
Go be alone. It'’ll be better
for the both of you.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.984
How about ants on a log?

17:53.028 --> 17:54.856
Yeah.Yay!

18:05.910 --> 18:08.391
Well, look at this.

18:08.435 --> 18:12.308
Worked with what you had, but
managed Miss Etta'’s delight.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.918
Well, she never made it.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.921
I was the one who
always made it for you.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.924
Oh, I know.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.413
Look, I'’m still having
a tough time with this.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.415
Tell me again what Bud said.

18:34.156 --> 18:38.769
He just said that if anybody
finds out what really happened,

18:38.813 --> 18:40.902
a lot of people
lose their jobs.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.904
Why did he just offer
this up to you?

18:42.947 --> 18:46.342
I mean, how well
do you know this guy?

18:46.386 --> 18:49.650
I clean his house,
you know?

18:49.693 --> 18:52.827
But he'’s good to me.
He trusts me.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.221
I don'’t think
he'’s a bad guy.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.049
I-I don'’t think he had anything
to do with what happened.

18:58.093 --> 19:02.489
I just think he may know more
about it than what he'’s saying.

19:02.532 --> 19:06.623
So maybe you could just
talk to him about it.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.846
I'’m not a cop anymore.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.631
So? You can still
talk to him, right?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.459
Look, I don'’t know.

19:16.503 --> 19:20.202
Maybe I just
let this one die.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.073
Really?

19:23.945 --> 19:26.165
I don'’t have any idea
who those people were

19:26.208 --> 19:28.036
or why they did that to me.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.299
They could be listening to us
right now.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.693
Knowing what they know,

19:32.736 --> 19:35.130
they could probably kill me
whenever they want.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.484
I never seen
you like this.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.705
Like what?

19:44.748 --> 19:46.968
Scared.

19:52.365 --> 19:55.019
Very abusive.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.413
When Mia first came
here, she was in...

19:57.457 --> 19:59.241
She was in terrible shape.Yeah.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.590
Lot of bruises.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.940
Broken jaw.
Oh, yeah.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.379
She ran away from him, came here
for help getting back on track.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.816
Where is she now?

20:08.859 --> 20:12.341
She died.

20:12.385 --> 20:15.562
He hasn'’t told you
any of this?

20:15.605 --> 20:18.173
She was here
for three months.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.959
Then he came and convinced her
to leave with him again.

20:22.003 --> 20:26.486
They took Carrie with them
and we never saw them again.

20:26.529 --> 20:30.664
Two weeks later,
Mia overdosed.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.623
At least that'’s
what he told us.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.931
Just... It-it...

20:36.974 --> 20:40.413
This doesn'’t sound
anything like him.

20:40.456 --> 20:44.330
You don'’t know
him, Dannie.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.548
You don'’t.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.477
Hey.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.740
Thought you'’d left.

21:03.784 --> 21:07.570
Yeah, I'’m on my way.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.746
Are you all right,
Mr. Furlbee?

21:09.790 --> 21:12.445
Yeah.
No, I'’m good. I'm good.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.056
I mean...

21:16.536 --> 21:18.277
I see it.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.279
Do you see it?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.758
Do I see it?

21:21.802 --> 21:23.630
Yeah, the way it all

21:23.673 --> 21:26.459
used to be.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.244
Sounds quaint.
Sounds nice.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.029
I grew up in it.
Couldn'’t fucking breathe.

21:32.073 --> 21:36.033
You'’d put a white shirt on
and by lunchtime it'’d be gray.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.253
Um...

21:38.297 --> 21:40.690
not sure I follow.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.737
Do you know...

21:46.348 --> 21:50.178
...that I am hated in this town?

21:53.312 --> 21:56.271
No, I-I...

21:59.535 --> 22:02.712
God, you are
a shitty liar, Tyler.

22:02.756 --> 22:06.020
I mean, you know, I'’ve heard
some criticisms, but...

22:06.063 --> 22:08.239
About what?
What? Uh...

22:08.283 --> 22:10.198
gentrification?

22:12.287 --> 22:15.421
Yeah, but I-I think it'’s
more about the displacement.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.944
Okay, first,

22:16.987 --> 22:18.989
do-do you know what happens
when high-income people

22:19.033 --> 22:21.557
move into low

22:21.601 --> 22:24.038
Incomes go up.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.605
Crime goes down.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.216
Schools get better.

22:28.259 --> 22:31.872
And the number of people
who are displaced

22:31.915 --> 22:34.222
is a lot less
than is commonly thought.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.832
A lot less.

22:35.876 --> 22:39.053
And look, you see anybody
out there getting displaced?

22:39.096 --> 22:41.011
Do you...
Take a look. No, loo...

22:41.055 --> 22:43.187
Take a look.I... No. No, I don'’t.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.537
Okay, you know what?

22:44.580 --> 22:48.279
What'’s the alternative?
What...

22:48.323 --> 22:52.240
Yeah, but what'’s...
what is their idea?

22:52.283 --> 22:54.242
I-I don'’t know.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.331
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know, either.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.855
I don'’t know.

22:58.899 --> 23:02.076
I mean, is it
to leave it all shitty?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.382
And I'’m not-I'm not
condescending.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.905
I mean, I'’m on their side.
It'’s...

23:04.948 --> 23:08.648
But the-the other choice
is to literally...

23:08.691 --> 23:10.998
just watch all the buildings
fall down.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.915
That'’s... that's
what'’s gonna happen.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.439
The only thing I'’ve ever seen
that works is that

23:17.483 --> 23:21.574
bringing money into a place
will make that place...

23:21.617 --> 23:24.228
a better place.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.363
But I'’m the asshole.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.583
Right, huh?
No vision,

23:30.626 --> 23:32.454
just money.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.152
Money, money, money.

23:35.196 --> 23:38.721
Uh, you...

23:38.765 --> 23:39.983
Do you want to... uh...

23:40.027 --> 23:42.072
Y-You should
come over to the house.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.814
I mean, c-come over
for... Have dinner

23:44.858 --> 23:47.774
with the... our...
the... our family. Yeah?

23:47.817 --> 23:51.255
Sure. Yeah.

23:51.299 --> 23:52.343
Good.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.302
Okay, good.

23:54.345 --> 23:57.479
Good. I mean, I don'’t know
how it'’s all gonna...

23:57.523 --> 23:59.350
work out,

23:59.394 --> 24:02.832
but they are trying
to conserve this thing...

24:02.876 --> 24:04.704
to death.

24:04.747 --> 24:07.837
So...

24:07.881 --> 24:09.796
That'’s good.
I'’ll see you.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.668
Okay?
Over there.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.411
♪

25:28.744 --> 25:31.486
♪

26:00.559 --> 26:01.995
Did you kill her?

26:02.038 --> 26:04.432
I don'’t try and kill anybody.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.347
We just play for fun.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.914
Did you win?

26:07.957 --> 26:10.177
Uh, dinner is
in 15 minutes.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.310
We have a ridiculous
amount of food in here.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.661
Have you ever thought about what
you'’re taking from somebody else

26:15.704 --> 26:17.358
by having too much?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.273
Oh, you mean from the freezer
section at the store?

26:19.316 --> 26:20.579
Hey, sweetheart,

26:20.622 --> 26:22.755
next time leave some Eggos
for the little people.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.584
You remember when I was little,

26:25.627 --> 26:28.891
where we lived before we moved
into this ridiculous house?

26:28.935 --> 26:30.763
Yes, I do. It'’s one
of our rent houses now.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.592
We can clear out the meth lab
and you can move in there

26:33.635 --> 26:35.332
:
if you want.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.248
You used to be such
a normal guy.

26:38.292 --> 26:41.034
I don'’t know what happened
to make you so...

26:41.077 --> 26:43.427
grabby.You know what?

26:43.471 --> 26:46.692
Me being grabby is what put
that tennis racket in your hand.

26:49.303 --> 26:51.827
She'’s soiling the nest

26:51.871 --> 26:53.437
so she doesn'’t feel so sad
when she leaves.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.004
She'’s doing it to me, too.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.572
She'’s being an asshole,
that'’s what she's doing.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.401
You have been a little
single-minded lately.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.576
Well, you know,
well, I'’m sorry

27:01.620 --> 27:03.099
that nobody loves
our lifestyle.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.448
That'’s not fair.

27:04.492 --> 27:07.190
There he is. Saved by the bell.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.198
Oh, in the nick of time.
Come on in.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.678
Hey.Come on, come on, come on.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.680
Got that for you.Oh, you brought us some wine.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.986
I don'’t drink.
Here. Yes, I do.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.117
Dannie, get on down here.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.684
Tyler'’s here.
We'’re having dinner.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.513
Hey, nice jacket. You gonna
sell us some ice cream later?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.167
TY:
Thank you, this was

27:27.210 --> 27:28.472
really wonderful.You'’re welcome.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.692
Thanks, Mom.WILSON: So, Ty, uh,

27:30.736 --> 27:33.477
Dannie'’s about to head off
to college. Any words of wisdom?

27:33.521 --> 27:35.784
Um...

27:35.828 --> 27:37.351
I don'’t know, uh...

27:37.394 --> 27:40.049
Well, I guess I would say that
the most important thing

27:40.093 --> 27:42.965
is to follow through, you know,

27:43.009 --> 27:44.880
under-promise, and then

27:44.924 --> 27:46.795
over-deliver.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.841
I'’m sure that'll come in handy.WILSON: That'’s-that's the best

27:48.884 --> 27:50.886
you got? '’Cause I...SANDY:
Hey, let'’s get out of here.

27:50.930 --> 27:54.673
What? Yup.
We'’re out. Okay.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.852
Um...

27:59.895 --> 28:02.593
thanks for ambushing me.

28:02.637 --> 28:06.119
Ambushing you?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.860
Oh, no, I just assumed
that your dad

28:07.903 --> 28:10.645
was gonna say I was coming over.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.213
He didn'’t.

28:13.256 --> 28:16.607
Look, I'’m sorry for
the asshole comment just now.

28:16.651 --> 28:20.481
I was just kind of bummed
that we missed our date.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.614
I had to babysit.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.792
So you said.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.665
What'’s that supposed to mean?

28:30.709 --> 28:34.277
I don'’t know, just... it was
a little confusing, I guess,

28:34.321 --> 28:37.063
'’cause we had made plans,

28:37.106 --> 28:39.935
and then...

28:39.979 --> 28:42.459
Sometimes plans change.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.114
Yeah.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.855
Yeah, they do.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.770
Listen, um,

28:48.814 --> 28:53.557
tell your parents thank you
for having me over.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.038
Ty, I

28:56.082 --> 28:57.344
I get it.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.784
Take care of yourself
at school, okay?

29:06.353 --> 29:08.834
Thank you for dinner,
Mr. and Mrs. Furlbee.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.836
It was really tasty.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.404
Mm.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.232
WILSON:
Uh, I guess you were wrong.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.234
I guess so.
I thought they were flirting.

29:18.278 --> 29:22.195
Wouldn'’t be appropriate anyway.
Although she could do worse.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.457
She will do worse.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.980
What does that mean?

29:25.024 --> 29:28.767
She'’s going to college.
She has mistakes ahead of her.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.333
She'’s a smart girl.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.380
Although she is going
through a thing. I mean...Yeah.

29:33.423 --> 29:36.122
Remember when she turned ten?Of course.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.297
The cake.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.952
I find you
in the bathroom.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.910
The what?I found you

29:41.954 --> 29:44.695
in the bathroom
with the cake.Oh, my God, that'’s right.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.175
I was...
It was the double digits.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.221
I was... I put the one candle
in the cake,

29:48.264 --> 29:50.136
and I put the zero candle
in the cake,

29:50.179 --> 29:52.355
and I freaked out.
I was so freaked out.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.488
I stole the cake,
I'’m hiding in the bathroom.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.142
All those little
girls'’ faces.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.448
Oh, God, you'’re...
Scarred for life.

29:58.492 --> 29:59.841
Hey.What?

29:59.885 --> 30:01.974
What do you think...
what do you think about us

30:02.017 --> 30:05.325
going to the Blue Ridge this
weekend? We could get a cabin.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.370
Oh, that cabin
was a dump.It was fine.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.111
No, if we-we...
if we go on vacation,

30:09.155 --> 30:10.199
we should go to Europe.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.158
Okay, then let'’s do that.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.681
Well, obviously,
we can'’t do that now.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.292
Then let'’s do the cabin thing.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.554
No, we should do something big.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.078
We can plan it,
like, for next summer.

30:19.121 --> 30:22.298
We-we don'’t even know if
she'’s gonna be back next summer.

30:22.342 --> 30:23.691
Nah,
she'’ll come back.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.388
B-But it'’s not
gonna be the same.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.912
Right now we'’re still
kind of a unit.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.870
Next year we won'’t be.Yeah, well, I can'’t.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.177
You know, I literally...
I can'’t.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.789
Right? I mean, you see
what I'’m doing, so...

30:43.189 --> 30:44.668
Yeah.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.240
I was hoping
there was still a chance.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.894
I'’m going downstairs.

30:52.938 --> 30:56.724
Yeah, uh, Sandy,
when you come back up,

30:56.767 --> 30:59.031
could you bring me some tea?

30:59.074 --> 31:01.947
Herbal?

31:08.475 --> 31:09.911
TRASK:
Thanks for coming down.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.392
Sure.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.879
Well, I can'’t imagine
I come all this way down

31:20.922 --> 31:22.054
to hear good news, so...

31:23.664 --> 31:26.406
The drop of blood
we found on your bandana

31:26.449 --> 31:28.147
belongs to your son.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.671
Um, maybe he used it

31:30.714 --> 31:32.847
to dab at a cut
or something,

31:32.891 --> 31:36.807
but the point is, this
means your ex-husband

31:36.851 --> 31:40.289
is one of the seven.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.987
Fuck you, Rick.

31:42.030 --> 31:45.860
Fuck you.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.518
When was the last time you spoke
to your ex

31:51.561 --> 31:52.649
Rick'’s an asshole,

31:52.693 --> 31:56.175
but he is not a bad man.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.786
So I don'’t want little Ricky
thinking anything differently.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.353
TRASK:
We'’re not asserting
otherwise, ma'’am.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.616
Oh, yeah, really? Then what
the fuck are you asserting?

32:02.659 --> 32:04.531
ROOK:
The best way

32:04.574 --> 32:06.489
for all of us to
find out what happened

32:06.533 --> 32:10.493
is for you to tell us
what you know.

32:10.537 --> 32:15.324
When did you
last see him?

32:15.368 --> 32:18.023
The day before, uh,
the bloods thing.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.113
Okay. And where was that?

32:21.156 --> 32:22.897
At Bell'’s.Bell'’s.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.421
He said he was gonna come back,
take little Ricky fishing later,

32:25.465 --> 32:26.988
but he never came back.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.772
ROOK:
Do you know who Rick
spent his time with

32:28.816 --> 32:30.296
while he was in Braden--
friends, associates?

32:30.339 --> 32:31.601
I don'’t know.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.255
TRASK:
Well, didn'’t he used to own

32:33.299 --> 32:34.561
the hardware store
with Ken Fry?

32:34.604 --> 32:36.998
Yeah, he did.

32:37.042 --> 32:41.002
Ken said he saw Rick later--
the next day,

32:41.046 --> 32:42.830
the day after.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.527
He had $500
Rick had given him

32:44.571 --> 32:47.139
for my child support.

32:47.182 --> 32:51.534
The day after seven bloods.

32:51.578 --> 32:56.496
Walmart said that he saw Rick
the day after.

32:56.539 --> 32:59.673
Okay.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.023
What does that mean?

33:02.067 --> 33:05.026
Does that mean
that he'’s still alive?

33:05.070 --> 33:07.028
We'’ll need to take
an official statement.

Hey, Wilkie!

34:52.133 --> 34:54.135
Goddamn, Pop.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.224
Hey, Wilk.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.922
What are you
doing here?

34:58.966 --> 35:00.272
I got a...

35:00.315 --> 35:03.188
We got this, uh,

35:03.231 --> 35:06.147
big PennDOT contract
for the mill,

35:06.191 --> 35:07.627
so I thought
I'’d come by,

35:07.670 --> 35:10.151
see some of my favorite
employees personally.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.762
See if you want
to come back.

35:12.806 --> 35:15.591
Millwork, man?

35:15.635 --> 35:17.550
Don'’t know if you want me
for millwork anymore.

35:17.593 --> 35:21.119
I'’d have you back
in a heartbeat, Wilk.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.598
That'’s why I'm here.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.867
You heard anything
about Cecil?

35:30.911 --> 35:35.002
Hell, man, he-he'’s been
in prison for...

35:35.045 --> 35:37.135
Wait. Prison?

35:37.178 --> 35:39.659
For years, man.

35:39.702 --> 35:43.141
Things got bad for him.
He was stealing and...

35:43.184 --> 35:44.403
What about, uh, um,

35:44.446 --> 35:47.057
J

35:47.101 --> 35:48.494
Davidson?

35:48.537 --> 35:50.670
Drugs, man.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.414
He'’s got
rehab, right?No.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.853
His wife O.D.'’d.

35:59.896 --> 36:03.204
Disappeared into his arm after.
I haven'’t...

36:03.248 --> 36:07.513
I haven'’t seen him in--
I don'’t know-- years.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.259
You know who'’s supposed to be
doing all right, though,

36:14.302 --> 36:16.391
is, uh, Roy.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.828
: Moats?Yeah.

36:18.872 --> 36:23.181
Heard that at least.
He'’s... he's got clean.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.356
He'’s living in Ohio.

36:24.399 --> 36:27.228
He'’s...

36:27.272 --> 36:30.536
Good.

36:30.579 --> 36:34.409
I, uh, done a bad job
keeping in touch

36:34.453 --> 36:37.107
with everybody.
Yinz were the first ones

36:37.151 --> 36:38.631
to call me Pop, you know?

36:51.992 --> 36:54.255
At least let me, uh,

36:54.299 --> 36:56.214
you know,
help you out.No, I-I'’m good.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.650
No, no, I'’m serious.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.261
I-I thought about it a hundred
different ways, I'’m...

37:00.305 --> 37:04.918
There'’s nothing to do.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.705
You'’ll call me if...

37:09.749 --> 37:11.577
Yeah.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.868
So he left Braden

37:41.911 --> 37:43.652
after the hardware store
with Mr. Fry closed.

37:43.696 --> 37:44.871
That was the summer of '’15?

37:44.914 --> 37:47.221
Yeah.
Yeah, he was, uh...

37:50.355 --> 37:52.705
...he was real bitter about it.

37:52.748 --> 37:56.404
Uh, he loved
owning his store.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.145
I always thought that
was probably why we,

37:58.188 --> 38:02.758
you know...

38:02.802 --> 38:04.586
Men don'’t roll
with the punches

38:04.630 --> 38:08.503
like we do when it
comes to jobs, you know?

38:08.547 --> 38:10.636
It'’s like, uh,

38:10.679 --> 38:13.203
it'’s like so much
of them is tied up

38:13.247 --> 38:15.554
in what they do, you know?

38:15.597 --> 38:17.599
TRASK:
Excuse me, Terri, um...

38:17.643 --> 38:20.123
Walmart'’s store isn't open,

38:20.167 --> 38:21.777
and he doesn'’t
seem to be around.

38:21.821 --> 38:22.952
Do you know where

38:22.996 --> 38:26.260
we might find him?Mm-mmm.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.609
Hey, can I ask you a question?

38:27.653 --> 38:30.612
Yeah, of course.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.311
What are you gonna say...

38:33.354 --> 38:34.747
when you announce it?

38:34.790 --> 38:38.011
That he'’s dead?
That he'’s a suspect?

38:38.054 --> 38:41.580
Just that he'’s been identified
as one of the seven.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.103
We won'’t speculate.

38:43.146 --> 38:46.802
Okay, well, you will be
the only ones that don'’t.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.815
How do I protect my little guy?

39:02.165 --> 39:04.820
I mean, I can'’t...

39:04.864 --> 39:08.824
tell him what happened
to his dad.

39:08.868 --> 39:13.089
I mean, we don'’t know, but...

39:15.265 --> 39:17.529
What am I supposed to tell him?

39:21.446 --> 39:23.230
I don'’t know.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.804
I'’m sorry.Yeah.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.199
Fine.
I'’m sorry.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.638
But the less you know,
the better.

42:36.858 --> 42:39.774
What'’d you do.
You, uh, you kill him?

42:39.818 --> 42:41.733
No.

42:41.776 --> 42:43.735
I told you what I did.

42:43.778 --> 42:47.173
I found '’em, I called you.

42:51.830 --> 42:53.222
Wha-What did you drag me
into here?

42:53.266 --> 42:54.876
Am I gonna, like, go to jail?

42:54.920 --> 42:58.358
No, you'’re not going to jail.
You'’re my son. I promised you,

42:58.401 --> 43:00.360
you'’re not going to j...You got to stop
fuckin'’ saying that.

43:00.403 --> 43:03.276
I-I'’m not your fucking son.All right, fine, fine.

43:03.319 --> 43:04.669
Just keep yelling, then.

43:04.712 --> 43:08.673
And we'’ll both be nailed
for covering it up.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.563
I need you to sit there,

43:29.607 --> 43:32.479
and I-I need you to tell me

43:32.522 --> 43:35.134
exactly what the fuck happened.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.833
TRASK:
I still don'’t get it.

43:38.877 --> 43:41.401
Yeah, that'’s what
I'’ve been saying.

43:41.444 --> 43:43.142
They killed seven people.

43:43.185 --> 43:46.754
Right? So what'’s the harm
in killing you?

43:46.798 --> 43:50.062
Thanks.Well...

43:50.105 --> 43:53.892
unless they didn'’t
kill the seventh.

43:56.198 --> 43:59.201
What was it that Bud
said to her, exactly?

43:59.245 --> 44:02.204
She doesn'’t think
he was a part of it.

44:02.248 --> 44:04.206
But he said people can'’t
find out what happened,

44:04.250 --> 44:08.080
or lots of people
will lose their jobs.

44:08.123 --> 44:10.691
So, do you think that
these guys that had you--

44:10.735 --> 44:12.171
you think those
were Bud'’s guys?

44:12.214 --> 44:15.261
What, like workers
or something?Mm-hmm.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.699
No, they seemed like they'’d
done this kind of thing before.

44:18.743 --> 44:22.790
So, really, we don'’t know Bud
was involved directly at all.

44:22.834 --> 44:24.923
Yeah, we do,
'’cause he said it.

44:24.966 --> 44:26.272
Look, can you
do me a favor

44:26.315 --> 44:27.795
and think about this
from the perspective of

44:27.839 --> 44:29.797
what if Bud Carl did this,
just for a second?

44:29.841 --> 44:31.277
Hey, man, you'’re the one
who said the thing

44:31.320 --> 44:32.757
about him being threatened.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.889
Why would someone
he'’s working with threaten him?

44:38.371 --> 44:39.589
Okay.

44:39.633 --> 44:42.114
Okay, let'’s do this
your way.

44:42.157 --> 44:46.422
Let'’s say that Bud is
sending something illegal

44:46.466 --> 44:47.423
over the border.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.730
Not whiskey, but...

44:49.774 --> 44:52.385
Drugs, right?
Got to be.

44:52.428 --> 44:53.865
Bud Carl'’s a drug dealer?

44:53.908 --> 44:55.605
Oh, for fuck'’s sake, why not?

44:55.649 --> 44:56.955
There was a time
when only rich white guys

44:56.998 --> 44:58.608
were dealing drugs
in this country.

44:58.652 --> 45:01.089
Oh, here we go. Why do you got
to bring race into it, huh?

45:01.133 --> 45:02.743
Every time I
disagree with you,

45:02.787 --> 45:04.397
you call me a racist.I apologized.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.833
It was a
half-assed apology.

45:05.877 --> 45:08.793
Yeah, well, it'’s because
I didn'’t mean it.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.884
Oh, boy.

45:12.927 --> 45:15.713
Look, I'’m not saying
you'’re like Travis Wilcox

45:15.756 --> 45:17.758
or some white supremacist.

45:17.802 --> 45:19.934
I just mean it'’s tribal.

45:19.978 --> 45:22.458
And I got it, too.

45:22.502 --> 45:25.331
Bud Carl looks like you.

45:25.374 --> 45:27.681
He employed your dad.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.075
My dad was a union man.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.642
He thought that Bud helping
his workers on the side

45:32.686 --> 45:34.688
was a way to keep them
loyal to him

45:34.732 --> 45:36.298
rather than the union.

45:36.342 --> 45:39.345
I'’m not some fucking shill
for Bud Carl.

45:43.653 --> 45:45.438
All right, maybe you'’re right
that Bud didn'’t know

45:45.481 --> 45:47.092
what was going on.

45:47.135 --> 45:49.137
And maybe he found out,
and now he'’s covering up

45:49.181 --> 45:51.096
for someone else.

45:51.139 --> 45:53.011
If there was one
illegal shipment,

45:53.054 --> 45:54.708
there'’ll be another.

45:54.752 --> 45:57.058
Right.

45:59.887 --> 46:01.367
And there'’s the warehouse, too.

46:01.410 --> 46:04.152
What warehouse?

46:12.117 --> 46:14.293
Has there been any infidelity?

46:14.336 --> 46:16.991
Not for me.
With him, possibly.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.645
There was a woman
he was texting with.

46:18.688 --> 46:19.907
A work associate.

46:19.951 --> 46:21.169
Do you have the texts?

46:21.213 --> 46:23.650
I don'’t care about that
anymore.

46:23.693 --> 46:26.566
I don'’t want to be there,
I don'’t want to be near him.

46:26.609 --> 46:28.176
I understand,
but in order to get

46:28.220 --> 46:29.612
what you need
out of this...

46:29.656 --> 46:32.833
I want to-I want to serve him
as soon as possible.

46:32.877 --> 46:34.574
Of course.

46:34.617 --> 46:37.098
And I'’m not trying to
dissuade you from that,

46:37.142 --> 46:38.360
but it would be
a good idea

46:38.404 --> 46:39.622
to know what
we have on him.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.363
At the very least,
we need to make sure

46:41.407 --> 46:43.626
he'’s not hiding assets.

46:43.670 --> 46:46.368
We want to know
what he has before...

46:46.412 --> 46:49.981
You take it all away
from him?

46:51.460 --> 46:54.202
We need to get
a forensic accountant.

46:54.246 --> 46:55.682
I can recommend one.

46:55.725 --> 46:56.901
A woman, which I find
a lot or my clients...

46:56.944 --> 46:59.077
I'’m gonna stop you there.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.906
If we need to look
into Wilson'’s finances,

47:01.949 --> 47:05.083
uh, I was an accountant
and his bookkeeper

47:05.126 --> 47:08.390
before I got demoted
to being his wife.

47:08.434 --> 47:11.524
Great.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.729
♪

48:07.536 --> 48:08.798
♪

48:30.298 --> 48:31.691
MAN:
Hello, Wilson.

48:31.734 --> 48:34.433
Oh, hi. Hey, Mayor.Good to see you.

48:34.476 --> 48:36.261
Come in.

48:36.304 --> 48:39.481
Thank you
for seeing me so quick.Always.

48:39.525 --> 48:41.701
Your calls go straight
to the bat phone in here.

48:41.744 --> 48:43.311
I can'’t think of a-a
higher compliment.

48:43.355 --> 48:46.010
Have a seat.
Oh.

48:46.053 --> 48:48.795
So, what can I do for you?

48:48.838 --> 48:51.276
Uh, okay, so, uh,

48:51.319 --> 48:54.148
you remember the plans I
showed you for downtown?

48:54.192 --> 48:56.803
Of course. You certainly have
plenty of property.

48:56.846 --> 48:58.326
How you doing
on investments?

48:58.370 --> 49:00.894
Well, we'’ve got a lot of,
uh, dominoes lined up,

49:00.938 --> 49:03.592
but linchpin is the mill.

49:03.636 --> 49:05.116
The mill'’s actually
doing pretty well.

49:05.159 --> 49:06.421
Well...I mean, considering.

49:06.465 --> 49:08.162
You heard about
the new contract?

49:08.206 --> 49:11.774
Well, yes, I did and that'’s what
I wanted to talk to you about.

49:11.818 --> 49:15.604
Uh, remember I showed
you the condos

49:15.648 --> 49:18.607
Well, we want to do a
whole slew of new housing.

49:18.651 --> 49:22.568
You mean like
Section 8 type stuff?Oh, no, no.

49:22.611 --> 49:25.310
No, no, no. No,
like the condos.

49:25.353 --> 49:27.268
Planned communities,
open-air malls,

49:27.312 --> 49:28.835
new families, uh, coming in.

49:28.878 --> 49:30.793
Wilson, listen,

49:30.837 --> 49:32.839
one thing I'’ve never
understood about your vision

49:32.882 --> 49:34.145
is who?

49:34.188 --> 49:35.711
Look around. We don'’t
have a middle class.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.931
Well, we got the,
uh, country club.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.107
You got retirees to move
to a five-star golf course,

49:40.151 --> 49:42.109
but that'’s not what
you'’re talking here.

49:42.153 --> 49:43.328
No, but, okay, what
about all the tech?

49:43.371 --> 49:44.720
The tech'’s in the city.

49:44.764 --> 49:47.201
You know the term
"job

49:47.245 --> 49:50.422
Most of those companies
use ten, 20 people tops.

49:50.465 --> 49:54.078
You can'’t revitalize
a dead steel town with that.

49:54.121 --> 49:56.036
Oh.

49:56.080 --> 50:00.345
So, the mill gets
one new contract

50:00.388 --> 50:04.044
and you jump on
the populism train?

50:05.437 --> 50:08.179
Even if the mill
gets back to full capacity,

50:08.222 --> 50:11.660
those folks
can'’t afford your condos.Yeah, well,

50:11.704 --> 50:13.445
I'’m not talking about those...

50:13.488 --> 50:14.837
I mean...

50:14.881 --> 50:17.492
Look, I'’m not trying
to be a pessimist.

50:17.536 --> 50:21.801
And I'’m always open
to any compelling idea.

50:21.844 --> 50:25.718
So, what is it you think
I can help you with?

50:28.155 --> 50:31.202
Uh...

50:31.245 --> 50:32.464
I don'’t know.

50:32.507 --> 50:35.249
Honestly, I was, uh...

50:36.729 --> 50:39.471
I, you know, I was hoping
you could help. I was...

50:39.514 --> 50:41.821
I was thinking you and I
could, you know...

50:41.864 --> 50:43.823
But, uh,

50:43.866 --> 50:46.826
yeah, you put your thumb on
the scale for development.

50:48.871 --> 50:51.613
I got it.

50:51.657 --> 50:53.659
JAKE:
Looks pretty empty.

50:53.702 --> 50:56.662
TRASK: Lori says that city
records have Carl Steel

50:56.705 --> 50:59.099
as still owning this place.

50:59.143 --> 51:00.579
Old prep plant.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.711
Ask her to look into this
guy, Michael Goodman.

51:02.755 --> 51:04.235
Goes by Goot.

51:04.278 --> 51:06.106
That the guy you saw Bud
out here arguing with?

51:06.150 --> 51:09.718
Yeah, and Carl still paid him
250k for website design.

51:09.762 --> 51:13.113
Why does a steel mill
need a $250,000 website?

51:13.157 --> 51:15.463
Well, speaking of that,

51:15.507 --> 51:17.117
we confiscated
the accountant'’s computer

51:17.161 --> 51:20.207
for any forensic information
in the sweep of the mill.

51:20.251 --> 51:22.949
You want to know
what we found?

51:22.992 --> 51:24.820
Spyware.Huh.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.692
Recently installed.

51:26.735 --> 51:29.825
Now, who would be watching him?

51:29.869 --> 51:31.436
I don'’t know.

51:31.479 --> 51:35.353
Hmm.Could be a pretty interesting
file on that, though.

51:35.396 --> 51:39.008
Possibly.

51:53.022 --> 51:54.502
Hey.

52:03.424 --> 52:07.211
How is it that you thought
I wouldn'’t find out?

52:07.254 --> 52:09.256
Uh...

52:09.300 --> 52:12.303
Gosh, I-I, uh...

52:12.346 --> 52:15.436
I don'’t know, sweetheart.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.962
You are less than three weeks

52:20.006 --> 52:22.574
from total collapse.

52:22.617 --> 52:24.184
No, no, I'’m-I'm, uh,

52:24.228 --> 52:27.013
momentarily overleveraged.

52:27.056 --> 52:29.624
It'’s, uh, it's an
occupational hazard.

52:29.668 --> 52:33.280
Can we have
the real conversation?Yeah.

52:33.324 --> 52:36.196
The one where you
drop the verbosity

52:36.240 --> 52:37.719
and the sunshine?

52:37.763 --> 52:40.679
Yes.

52:40.722 --> 52:43.595
You are a hair away
from losing everything.

52:43.638 --> 52:48.513
Ten million in the red
to First Pennsylvania.

52:48.556 --> 52:51.472
Five to the limited partners

52:51.516 --> 52:53.866
on the first savings.I know. I know, I know.

52:53.909 --> 52:57.304
And-and your moves
make no sense.Sandy...

52:57.348 --> 52:58.827
You borrowed against
the townhouses to build

52:58.871 --> 53:00.264
the live-work lofts.
Why would...Sandy, Sandy, Sandy.

53:00.307 --> 53:01.352
Sandy, I know.

53:01.395 --> 53:04.181
I know. Stop.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.183
Stop.

53:06.226 --> 53:09.447
Please, stop.

53:09.490 --> 53:13.668
What happened to you?

53:13.712 --> 53:16.236
Hey, wait, d-do you want
to go to that cabin?

53:16.280 --> 53:18.847
The, uh, the Blue Ridge?

53:18.891 --> 53:20.458
No.

53:22.242 --> 53:23.635
No.

53:23.678 --> 53:27.465
No, I want you to change.

53:30.337 --> 53:33.558
When I first met you...

53:33.601 --> 53:36.387
you worked hard because

53:36.430 --> 53:40.304
you loved it.Oh...

53:40.347 --> 53:42.088
And when you
were off of work,

53:42.131 --> 53:44.830
you threw yourself
into that even more.: I know.

53:44.873 --> 53:47.311
I know, I know.

53:47.354 --> 53:50.357
I'’m not saying this
to chastise you.

53:50.401 --> 53:52.925
I'’m not saying it
because I'’m mad.

53:52.968 --> 53:55.493
I just want to know--

53:55.536 --> 53:57.799
what was the last thing you did

53:57.843 --> 54:01.716
that you were
whole

54:07.896 --> 54:11.857
I'’m not entirely sure,
but if I open this file,

54:11.900 --> 54:14.686
then click on this...Mm-hmm.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.254
Tap.

54:17.297 --> 54:19.691
No shit, here it is.China.

54:19.734 --> 54:22.346
Bud said that'’s where
they were sending the bourbon.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.870
Why?Uh, a gift.

54:24.913 --> 54:28.482
To help him get
some steel contract?

54:28.526 --> 54:30.267
China'’s the number-one
steel producer

54:30.310 --> 54:31.920
in the world, Pete.

54:31.964 --> 54:35.489
Why in God'’s name is Bud Carl
sending steel to China?
