03:42.397 --> 03:45.491
Americans are going crazy
over Japanese art now.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.397
I'll put all the money in,
and you run the place.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.434
There's no better expert than you.

03:50.705 --> 03:54.163
Look, we'll open the first gallery
in Los Angeles, then Chicago.

03:54.242 --> 03:57.939
-And later New York--
-I'm sorry, but I must stay in Japan.

03:58.380 --> 04:01.110
My father, my grandfather, were killed...

04:01.984 --> 04:03.576
fighting on this land.

04:03.652 --> 04:07.520
You gonna wait here until the same thing
happens to you? That's crazy.

04:26.810 --> 04:27.970
There!

05:32.744 --> 05:33.904
Yoshi.

09:31.525 --> 09:35.393
Cho, you've gotta leave Japan.
This will never end here.

09:36.197 --> 09:37.824
They killed my wife...

09:38.166 --> 09:40.293
-and my son.
-And they'll be back.

09:40.669 --> 09:42.762
You can't fight the ninja forever.

09:43.038 --> 09:44.562
You have a son.

09:45.006 --> 09:47.474
You want him caught up
in all this bloodshed?

09:48.276 --> 09:49.538
Come with me.

09:49.778 --> 09:51.803
My son's place is here.

09:53.615 --> 09:55.082
You see this?

09:55.617 --> 09:57.812
His father died on this land.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.051
And now...

10:00.856 --> 10:02.118
his wife.

10:02.825 --> 10:05.658
This soil is sacred with our family blood.

10:06.062 --> 10:08.462
Do you want to see your son dead?

10:08.597 --> 10:10.462
And your grandson, too?

10:10.733 --> 10:14.294
I'm offering him a great fortune
in America, a new life.

10:15.071 --> 10:19.371
We'll open a gallery. You and your son can
be safe in America. You can be happy again.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.575
And you, Mrs. Osaki...

10:23.512 --> 10:25.241
you should come, too.

10:29.953 --> 10:32.387
I do not trust this man, my son.

10:37.227 --> 10:40.094
Braden is my friend. He means well.

10:42.566 --> 10:45.592
It's for his life. We must consider this offer.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.630
You cannot escape your karma, my son.

10:49.473 --> 10:52.931
Even if you go as far as America,
it will come for you.

10:53.678 --> 10:55.441
Believe me, it will.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.673
-Come on, we're gonna kick his ass!
-Get out of my way, man.

11:25.577 --> 11:29.479
How was your class today?
Did you enjoy the lunch?

11:29.782 --> 11:32.342
Such a funny old lady.

11:35.721 --> 11:37.518
He thinks he's tough?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.292
Who are they?

11:44.431 --> 11:46.058
Hey, man, what's your trick?

11:46.599 --> 11:47.861
-Kick his ass.
-Yeah.

11:48.268 --> 11:50.168
Could you move, please?

11:51.805 --> 11:53.272
Give it back!

11:54.107 --> 11:55.438
Go for it.

11:58.378 --> 12:00.608
Go get him! Come on!

12:02.782 --> 12:03.942
Hurry up! Get him!

12:04.551 --> 12:05.540
Go!

12:18.566 --> 12:20.193
-Get him!
-Watch out!

12:34.181 --> 12:35.580
My eyes!

12:38.053 --> 12:39.816
Come on, we got him!

12:48.029 --> 12:49.724
I told you not to fight.

12:50.332 --> 12:52.960
Do not yell at him. He did no wrong.

12:53.034 --> 12:56.868
I did not bring him here to America
to fight in the streets with fools.

12:56.938 --> 12:58.098
Cho...

12:58.707 --> 13:01.642
it does not matter where you raise him.

13:02.044 --> 13:06.447
You must teach him the way of the ninja.
It's the family tradition.

13:06.716 --> 13:09.207
This bears the sign of our family.

13:09.352 --> 13:11.786
And when I die, it will be yours.

13:13.122 --> 13:14.749
And then Kane's.

13:15.024 --> 13:16.548
So prepare him.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.620
Show him the ways.

13:22.832 --> 13:26.825
These are the dolls we are going to sell
in our new gallery, Kane.

13:35.345 --> 13:39.008
I have given up fighting.
My sword is sealed forever.

13:39.783 --> 13:43.241
Here in America,
I will not follow the way of the ninja.

13:44.221 --> 13:45.449
No more.

13:46.223 --> 13:47.747
Why not, Daddy?

13:49.426 --> 13:51.917
Because the way killed your mother.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.192
So remember...

13:56.134 --> 13:57.624
you are not samurai.

13:58.069 --> 13:59.263
Not ninja.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.702
We only practice with our sword...

14:01.806 --> 14:04.639
to honor our tradition. Do you understand?

14:06.177 --> 14:07.303
Good.

14:07.779 --> 14:09.269
Then show me.

14:14.218 --> 14:15.617
Eye contact!

14:27.967 --> 14:29.195
Balance!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.863
Power!

14:48.989 --> 14:50.957
That was fantastic.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.893
Better get going, honey.
You're going to be late for baseball practice.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.064
He's really improving, isn't he?

15:06.339 --> 15:07.704
Guess what?

15:08.008 --> 15:11.535
The dolls have cleared customs.
They'll be here by noon.

15:11.946 --> 15:13.538
I called your partner, Braden.

15:13.614 --> 15:16.242
He'll be by sometime this afternoon
to look them over.

15:16.317 --> 15:18.649
Cathy, you help me so much.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.279
I really think I should pay you.

15:21.622 --> 15:24.614
No, really, I love doing things for you.

15:25.793 --> 15:28.887
Besides, my karate training
is more than enough.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.455
I just want you to teach me the way.

15:35.836 --> 15:38.896
If you want to work out,
you forgot your pants.

15:39.841 --> 15:41.866
You really think I forgot?

15:45.647 --> 15:46.807
God...

15:48.350 --> 15:49.942
you're so strong.

15:50.752 --> 15:52.720
Do you wish to work out?

15:55.357 --> 15:56.881
Of course I do.

16:52.850 --> 16:56.013
This is our latest gallery.
lt'll open next week.

16:56.387 --> 16:59.914
My partner put together
the best Japanese doll collection in town.

17:00.925 --> 17:03.257
-Hi, Cho, how are you?
-Fine, thank you.

17:03.528 --> 17:06.019
The shipment has just arrived from Japan.

17:06.330 --> 17:09.357
-We are unpacking the dolls right now.
-They're perfection.

17:09.434 --> 17:12.130
-Everything arrived as ordered?
-Everything.

17:12.203 --> 17:15.763
I'll put 12 in the showroom,
and the rest in storage.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.167
How do you like the display?

17:19.377 --> 17:21.470
Fantastic. It's wonderful.

17:21.814 --> 17:24.146
You've got excellent taste.

17:27.419 --> 17:31.378
-Hello, Cathy, how are you?
-Please, come and see the rest of the dolls.

17:32.491 --> 17:35.119
They are all beautiful and authentic.

17:35.995 --> 17:39.726
Every one is handmade.
Each takes almost two months to make.

17:42.601 --> 17:44.398
This one comes from Hakata.

17:44.470 --> 17:47.371
I knew there was a reason
I made you my partner.

17:48.708 --> 17:51.142
You couldn't have made a better selection.

17:51.645 --> 17:54.637
Nothing would have been possible
without your help.

17:54.714 --> 17:55.738
No.

17:56.082 --> 17:59.745
Money's easy to find,
but good men, that's another story.

18:00.187 --> 18:02.212
This is going to work out.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.620
It's a ninja. Professional soldier.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.200
Specializing in espionage
and assassination.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.934
About 400 years ago.

18:18.406 --> 18:21.341
Worst bastards
the world's ever known, right?

18:21.576 --> 18:25.307
It's a common misunderstanding
that the ninja were all evil.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.546
But not accurate.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.046
-They still killed people.
-That was their special skill.

18:31.118 --> 18:33.211
The thousand ways of death.

18:33.387 --> 18:34.877
Like I said...

18:35.323 --> 18:39.089
this gallery's gonna be the best thing
that's happened to this town...

18:40.529 --> 18:42.156
since I got here.

19:01.984 --> 19:05.044
Don't touch it! What have you done?

19:06.756 --> 19:11.022
This is a very expensive doll you broke.
Your father will be so angry.

19:11.995 --> 19:13.326
I'm sorry.

19:16.132 --> 19:19.295
Don't worry.
I won't say anything to your father.

19:19.736 --> 19:21.829
I'll fix this doll somehow.

19:23.039 --> 19:25.337
But you've got to promise me...

19:25.408 --> 19:28.309
you'll never touch any of these dolls again.

19:29.279 --> 19:30.371
Okay?

19:31.115 --> 19:33.106
This will be our little secret.

19:35.953 --> 19:37.443
Run along now.

19:44.995 --> 19:46.895
I'll talk to you later.

19:47.731 --> 19:48.720
Now...

19:49.099 --> 19:50.623
what is it, my love?

19:50.701 --> 19:52.726
We have a problem, Braden.

19:52.937 --> 19:54.996
What's happened, Catherine?

19:55.072 --> 19:56.505
It's little Kane.

19:56.574 --> 19:59.304
He broke one of the dolls,
and the heroin spilled out.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.305
Damn it!

20:02.480 --> 20:05.415
You're supposed to watch those dolls.
That's your job.

20:05.483 --> 20:07.781
It's okay, he didn't even know what it was.

20:08.086 --> 20:10.987
-I'll make sure he doesn't tell anybody.
-You'd better.

20:11.323 --> 20:13.257
It won't happen again, I promise.

20:13.325 --> 20:16.123
This gallery setup is becoming too risky.

20:16.661 --> 20:18.754
When are you gonna get rid of the stuff?

20:19.164 --> 20:22.429
I'm seeing Caifano today,
so we'll probably unload tonight.

20:23.436 --> 20:26.200
And, Cathy, no more screwups.

20:46.325 --> 20:49.226
Hi, I have an appointment with Mr. Caifano.

20:49.363 --> 20:50.591
Hold on.

20:52.899 --> 20:55.333
Caifano, Braden's here to see you.

20:58.138 --> 20:59.799
Send him up.

21:00.841 --> 21:02.741
It's Braden, he's here.

21:03.210 --> 21:06.145
-What are we gonna do?
-I'll handle it.

21:08.515 --> 21:09.846
Hey, Gino.

21:11.051 --> 21:13.576
You're looking at yourself too much.

21:13.987 --> 21:15.579
It's not normal.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.588
Your nephew doesn't want
to disappoint the ladies, you know?

21:22.463 --> 21:24.693
-Say, here he is.
-Hey, partner.

21:26.934 --> 21:29.232
What's the good word?

21:29.837 --> 21:32.806
The dolls have arrived.
They're ready for delivery.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.000
Great.

21:34.842 --> 21:37.436
Have a drink? Joe, go mix him a drink.

21:37.512 --> 21:40.310
I didn't come for a drink. I want my money.

21:40.382 --> 21:44.341
-I want you to take delivery immediately.
-Okay. What's the big rush?

21:44.420 --> 21:47.321
This stuff is hot.
I need the money right now.

21:48.457 --> 21:50.288
You have to wait on the money.

21:50.359 --> 21:53.226
The deal was, I get the money
the minute the dolls are here.

21:53.295 --> 21:56.264
-Few days ain't gonna make no difference.
-A big difference!

21:56.331 --> 21:59.994
I need that money right now.
My Japanese connection wants their cut.

22:00.069 --> 22:04.199
-I can't mess with those people.
-I gave those guys $100,000 up front.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.500
They want the rest
of the money today, in cash.

22:07.710 --> 22:10.042
Now, what am I supposed to tell them?

22:10.313 --> 22:11.871
How about....

22:20.423 --> 22:23.824
If you don't have the money,
I'll find somebody who does.

22:23.893 --> 22:26.521
And you can kiss your $100,000 good-bye.

22:28.498 --> 22:30.466
Tell your goons to move.

22:31.534 --> 22:32.933
You tell us.

22:33.571 --> 22:36.165
You're dealing with me now.

22:37.708 --> 22:41.974
As far as you're concerned,
that stuff is already paid for. It's mine!

22:42.847 --> 22:45.042
So don't try any funny stuff.

22:45.416 --> 22:49.477
Don't fuck with the Japanese.
They can be very dangerous.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.478
I'll fuck with whoever I want.
I don't need you.

22:54.525 --> 22:55.992
I'll make my own deal.

22:56.060 --> 23:00.622
If you're thinking of going behind my back,
you'll be making a big mistake.

23:01.366 --> 23:03.300
A very big mistake.

23:04.469 --> 23:06.562
You don't even know me yet.

23:31.931 --> 23:34.832
-The pickles--
-I told you to eat before you drink the soda.

23:34.901 --> 23:37.028
-Mario, you eat--
-What is this?

23:37.103 --> 23:39.628
What did you bring?
Nobody's gonna eat that shit.

23:40.039 --> 23:43.406
You know, you're getting so skinny,
you're looking like a razorblade.

23:44.177 --> 23:45.166
Take it easy.

23:46.612 --> 23:48.910
-Have another beer.
-I don't need another beer.

23:48.981 --> 23:51.848
Fucking beer's going right through me.
I'm gonna take a leak.

23:51.919 --> 23:53.113
-All right?
-All right.

23:53.420 --> 23:54.944
Oh, shit, that feels good.

24:07.434 --> 24:10.597
What the fuck is this, Halloween?
Get outta here.

24:11.572 --> 24:13.301
You son of a bitch!

24:59.455 --> 25:01.252
There he is, come on.

25:05.394 --> 25:09.387
I got bad news, Mr. C.
I don't think you'll get your money today.

25:09.566 --> 25:13.969
On the street, the word is that
there's a ton of H on the way from Japan.

25:14.804 --> 25:17.432
Some Jap, he's taken over your market.

25:22.212 --> 25:23.839
Goddamn Japanese.

25:25.749 --> 25:28.343
They break Detroit. Now they want me.

25:31.221 --> 25:33.382
-You keep sniffing around.
-Sure.

25:33.456 --> 25:35.651
-I'll be in touch.
-Sure.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.703
-What's going on here?
-Holy--

26:25.777 --> 26:27.244
Jesus Christ!

26:28.748 --> 26:29.840
Grab him!

26:34.787 --> 26:36.414
What the shit is this?

28:33.977 --> 28:36.468
-Get those people out of here.
-Move back.

28:38.549 --> 28:39.982
Everybody back, come on.

28:40.117 --> 28:42.085
Look, here comes Caifano.

28:42.386 --> 28:44.684
Bad news travels fast, don't it?

28:46.324 --> 28:48.758
His brother, his stoolie, now his nephew.

28:48.826 --> 28:53.092
-He'll be buying a lot of flowers this week.
-Get lost. This is a private conversation.

28:53.164 --> 28:56.099
-My pleasure.
-Hold it right there, guys.

29:00.938 --> 29:04.669
-That my nephew?
-And his girlfriend. You wanna take a look?

29:05.010 --> 29:06.671
What the hell for?

29:07.212 --> 29:10.841
What's so goddamn important that
you and me gotta have a talk, lieutenant?

29:10.916 --> 29:13.214
What's so important, asshole...

29:13.685 --> 29:14.982
is they're dead.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.950
They've been drowned.

29:17.122 --> 29:21.081
The coroner said it's gonna take
a jackhammer to get them apart.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.658
-He was a good-looking kid.
-You talk to me, you son of a bitch.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.790
If somebody's muscling in,
I wanna know who the fuck it is!

29:27.867 --> 29:29.459
-That's my bag of apples.
-And mine.

29:29.536 --> 29:33.597
Bullshit! You guys celebrate downtown
every time one of us gets the clap.

29:33.673 --> 29:35.300
What the fuck do you want from me?

29:35.375 --> 29:39.505
I want a name, I want addresses.
I've got nothing.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.672
Then you've got what I've got, shit!

30:03.971 --> 30:07.429
That's Dave Hatcher,
the guy I told you about. He's the instructor.

30:29.197 --> 30:32.997
Dave Hatcher, Lt. Dime.
I understand you wanna get involved.

30:33.068 --> 30:35.969
-What's up?
-Come here. I wanna talk to you.

30:37.272 --> 30:40.207
Take a look.
This is what's left of Caifano's brother.

30:40.275 --> 30:41.765
His right leg.

30:42.043 --> 30:45.911
The largest bone in the body,
and it's been cracked like a toothpick.

30:48.951 --> 30:50.612
This is his chest.

30:51.554 --> 30:54.523
The sternum has been shattered
in nine different places...

30:54.590 --> 30:59.289
the clavicle has been cracked in two,
and the ribs have been crushed.

30:59.829 --> 31:00.887
Jesus.

31:03.032 --> 31:05.557
This is his head, what's left of it.

31:05.935 --> 31:07.459
Now, Hatcher...

31:08.804 --> 31:10.533
my question to you:

31:11.040 --> 31:14.441
Is it possible for a man
to do this to another man?

31:14.511 --> 31:16.376
Sure, driving a truck.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.571
The coroner claims no weapon was used.

31:18.649 --> 31:21.743
And yet the blows were struck
against the large bone...

31:21.952 --> 31:25.115
at a precise 90-degree angle,
as if by a machine.

31:25.589 --> 31:27.819
-Could you cause that kind of damage?
-No.

31:27.891 --> 31:31.827
-lt requires special training from childhood.
-Do you know anyone that could?

31:31.895 --> 31:34.762
There was Arou,
a group in Japan that were bone-breakers.

31:34.831 --> 31:36.822
About 300 or 400 years ago.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.027
I'm talking about Thursday at 11:00.

31:39.103 --> 31:41.503
I don't know anybody that could have.

31:41.673 --> 31:45.131
But I have a Japanese friend,
someone who's an expert on these things.

31:45.209 --> 31:46.335
Bring him to me.

32:28.487 --> 32:31.581
Come on, we've never seen anything
like this before.

32:31.691 --> 32:33.716
We're up against the wall in this case.

32:33.793 --> 32:37.752
I think it involves some ninja techniques,
like bone-breaking, blowguns.

32:38.231 --> 32:39.960
You're an expert on that stuff.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.096
Do it for me as a personal favor.

32:42.235 --> 32:44.533
What the hell do you call
this damned thing?

32:44.904 --> 32:46.735
<i>It's called a star shuriken.</i>

32:47.073 --> 32:48.301
Ninja weapon.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.341
Ninja, is that one
of those martial arts things?

32:51.611 --> 32:53.602
The ninja's much more powerful.

32:53.947 --> 32:55.847
They were warriors of ancient times.

32:55.916 --> 32:59.181
You know, masters of assassination
in medieval Japan.

32:59.420 --> 33:01.752
Are you trying to tell me there's ninjas...

33:02.056 --> 33:05.651
running around there,
killing people in the 20th century? Come on.

33:06.427 --> 33:10.420
Couldn't an athlete, a professional,
throw one of these things?

33:10.498 --> 33:11.522
Why not?

33:11.599 --> 33:15.558
He wouldn't have a master to teach him,
show him how to build the damn thing.

33:15.870 --> 33:18.668
He couldn't hit a door with one of those.

33:20.908 --> 33:23.399
The length of the blade is precise.

33:23.645 --> 33:28.309
Only by passing through the gate
of the eyes can it reach the brain and kill.

33:29.651 --> 33:30.640
Oh, shit.

33:31.019 --> 33:32.850
It's really very simple.

33:33.155 --> 33:35.851
Mr. Osaki, I understand
you didn't want to come here.

33:35.924 --> 33:38.358
We can't afford to pay you
very much money...

33:38.426 --> 33:42.157
but if you're half right about what you say,
then we're gonna need your help.

33:42.297 --> 33:44.765
-I'm sorry.
-Cho, come on.

33:45.333 --> 33:48.530
It's impossible.
I'm opening up a new gallery tomorrow.

33:48.604 --> 33:50.162
I have no time.

34:09.225 --> 34:10.715
Don't, please!

34:22.406 --> 34:24.306
It's private, get lost.

34:26.009 --> 34:27.237
Come on.

34:28.178 --> 34:31.079
-What do you want?
-Come on.

34:32.416 --> 34:35.146
I can't believe what you're doing to me.

34:35.552 --> 34:38.315
<i>Tell them Jap friends of yours
to lay off my family.</i>

34:43.527 --> 34:46.224
<i>I set you up in this country, remember?</i>

34:46.764 --> 34:48.129
You owe me one.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.860
Come on, let's meet.

34:50.301 --> 34:51.996
Have you got the money?

34:52.070 --> 34:55.665
Of course I've got the money.
You bring the stuff to my office.

34:56.373 --> 34:57.841
And I'll pay you, COD.

34:57.909 --> 35:00.173
COD is no good anymore.

35:00.678 --> 35:02.009
Cash in advance.

35:02.146 --> 35:05.877
<i>I'll meet you at the gallery in three hours.
I'll wait for you there.</i>

35:05.951 --> 35:06.975
<i>Come alone.</i>

35:07.219 --> 35:08.345
Bring the cash.

35:11.223 --> 35:12.952
The son of a bitch!

35:14.860 --> 35:16.885
Chief, Alberto, come here.

35:18.264 --> 35:21.461
You know where that new gallery,
that Japanese gallery is...

35:21.533 --> 35:23.558
-on Third and Broadway?
-Yeah.

35:24.336 --> 35:26.463
I want you to go down there.

35:27.072 --> 35:28.869
Clean the place out.

35:29.174 --> 35:33.736
Especially the little Japanese dolls.
You bring them all here to me, understand?

35:34.147 --> 35:35.910
-Come.
-Hey!

35:37.217 --> 35:41.449
If anybody gets in your way,
scalp them, right?

35:58.272 --> 36:01.036
Keep an eye on the girl.
Don't let her out of the house.

36:01.108 --> 36:04.202
If she gives you any trouble,
you know what to do.

36:13.688 --> 36:15.019
Okay, let's take 'em.

36:23.899 --> 36:25.799
-Come on, let's go.
-I got this one.

36:39.514 --> 36:41.141
Come on, let's hurry.

36:43.885 --> 36:45.011
Give me a hand here.

37:26.997 --> 37:28.988
Come on, you!

38:10.076 --> 38:11.941
Come on, let's get out of here.

38:52.853 --> 38:53.842
Hey, look!

38:55.455 --> 38:57.446
Move it! Jeez!

39:43.305 --> 39:44.431
Holy shit!

47:55.949 --> 47:59.043
Tell the lieutenant, if you see him,
I'm at the gallery.

47:59.553 --> 48:01.748
Okay, but I'll tell him. Oh, here he is.

48:01.822 --> 48:04.814
Lieutenant, I was trying to find you.
Wait a second.

48:06.795 --> 48:09.889
I notified Missing Persons.
They put a bulletin out on your boy.

48:10.065 --> 48:12.556
It should be out on the air within an hour.

48:12.734 --> 48:14.759
I don't know. Somebody will see him.

48:15.003 --> 48:16.868
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

48:18.139 --> 48:21.700
Any relatives, friends?
Any place he might have gone?

48:21.976 --> 48:23.944
We are still strangers here.

48:24.112 --> 48:26.012
He must be hiding someplace.

48:26.314 --> 48:28.248
He knows the danger.

48:28.416 --> 48:30.714
He will not return until he must.

48:31.087 --> 48:33.351
-Do you suspect anyone?
-Everyone.

48:34.156 --> 48:35.316
As you do.

48:36.292 --> 48:38.260
We still need your help, Osaki.

48:39.662 --> 48:40.822
I'm sorry.

49:22.540 --> 49:24.565
Cathy, the dolls are gone.

49:24.809 --> 49:26.970
Someone stole them from the gallery.

49:27.245 --> 49:29.042
I was double-crossed.

49:29.313 --> 49:31.873
Now listen, little Kane saw me.

49:32.383 --> 49:34.817
Find him, and bring him here to me.

49:35.153 --> 49:38.384
Not Kane. Not Cho, please.

49:39.657 --> 49:41.557
Count with me.

49:42.760 --> 49:44.421
-"Five."
-Five.

49:46.697 --> 49:49.131
-"Four."
-Four.

49:50.836 --> 49:52.531
-"Three."
-Three.

49:54.173 --> 49:55.162
"Two."

49:57.976 --> 49:59.034
"One."

50:04.650 --> 50:07.141
Now go and get him.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.095
Sorry to disturb you, but I think I can help.

50:50.331 --> 50:51.855
It's all right.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.697
There are some ex-cons who might
have some information about your dolls.

50:56.770 --> 50:59.466
I thought you might like
to check them out with me.

51:03.477 --> 51:04.774
Good. I'll drive.

51:15.456 --> 51:16.616
That's them.

51:19.894 --> 51:23.990
Look, here come the police, man.
Wonder what he wants with us this time.

51:25.633 --> 51:29.694
I own that new Japanese
doll gallery downtown.

51:33.742 --> 51:35.710
Some thieves broke into it.

51:35.777 --> 51:37.677
My son is missing, too.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.110
Do you know anything about it?

51:43.318 --> 51:44.945
Hey, you know me.

51:45.454 --> 51:47.649
Do I have to haul your asses in again?

51:47.856 --> 51:49.118
Fuck off, pal.

52:03.973 --> 52:05.201
Come on.

52:14.918 --> 52:15.907
Come on.

52:17.854 --> 52:18.843
Let's go.

52:19.989 --> 52:21.217
Come on, boy!

56:15.434 --> 56:17.334
We've been going crazy.

56:18.371 --> 56:19.838
Are you okay?

56:23.910 --> 56:25.901
We're friends, aren't we?

56:30.149 --> 56:32.117
Just like your father...

56:33.286 --> 56:34.617
aren't you?

56:35.588 --> 56:37.215
You can sense it.

56:38.090 --> 56:39.682
You're right.

56:41.394 --> 56:43.157
You should be afraid.

56:43.563 --> 56:46.157
I have to take you, and you can't stop me.

58:43.621 --> 58:45.680
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

58:46.390 --> 58:48.483
Take him and hold him till I get back.

58:48.993 --> 58:51.826
-What are you gonna do to him?
-None of your business.

58:51.896 --> 58:54.763
Leave him alone. He's only a child.

58:55.634 --> 58:58.000
You told me you weren't going to hurt him.

58:58.503 --> 59:00.061
You stay out of this!

59:01.039 --> 59:03.030
Take him! Get rid of him.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.587
Who is it?

59:16.755 --> 59:18.518
You don't keep appointments.

59:19.892 --> 59:23.328
Crazy bastard,
you think you're pretty clever.

59:23.896 --> 59:25.921
<i>I'm one step ahead of you.</i>

59:26.399 --> 59:28.299
I'm coming to get you.

59:28.901 --> 59:30.528
Just stay right where you are.

59:31.037 --> 59:32.629
You're welcome.

59:33.373 --> 59:36.536
Tony! Come here.
I want all the boys in the pool room.

59:36.609 --> 59:38.702
I want them there in five minutes.

01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:06.268
You guys, you know what to do?

01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:08.466
Keep your eyes peeled for Braden.

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:10.108
He's coming.

01:00:11.813 --> 01:00:14.008
All right, now get out of here.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.528
All right, come on, over here.

01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:29.187
Rio, over there.

01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:31.631
Come on, spread it out.

01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:34.759
Move it up, a little up.

01:00:56.325 --> 01:00:58.190
I think Kane was here.

01:01:04.267 --> 01:01:06.235
-Hello?
-Cho, it's Cathy.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:10.162
<i>-Where are you?
-I'm locked in Braden's.</i>

01:01:11.174 --> 01:01:12.198
I'm scared.

01:01:12.275 --> 01:01:13.606
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

01:01:13.744 --> 01:01:15.234
What's the matter with you?

01:01:15.612 --> 01:01:17.807
Listen to me. Braden's crazy.

01:01:18.749 --> 01:01:20.478
He's using you like he used me.

01:01:21.118 --> 01:01:22.642
<i>And he's going to kill Kane.</i>

01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:26.784
What are you talking about? He's my friend.

01:01:26.957 --> 01:01:28.447
He was never your friend!

01:01:28.859 --> 01:01:32.590
He's been using the gallery as a front
for his heroin deals.

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:39.267
Where's Braden? Is he there?

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:42.729
No. That's what I've been trying to tell you.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.534
He went to kill the man named Caifano.

01:01:46.177 --> 01:01:47.906
-Caifano?
-Yes.

01:01:47.979 --> 01:01:50.243
<i>Where is Kane?</i>

01:01:51.783 --> 01:01:54.684
It's all my fault.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.853
I brought him to Braden's.

01:01:58.056 --> 01:01:59.455
<i>He hypnotized me.</i>

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:02.056
<i>He's a ninja. Do you understand?</i>

01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:04.252
I'm afraid I do.

01:02:06.565 --> 01:02:09.056
But what about Braden?

01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:11.266
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:18.132
Take her and hold her with the boy.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:19.677
What's wrong?

01:02:21.381 --> 01:02:24.350
-It's Braden. He's got Kane.
-Braden?

01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.383
Yes. He's a ninja.

01:02:28.588 --> 01:02:30.078
He betrayed me.

01:02:30.156 --> 01:02:33.455
lmpossible. He's an American.
How can he be a ninja?

01:02:33.526 --> 01:02:35.824
He lived for 20 years in Japan.

01:02:36.429 --> 01:02:39.057
He trained Koga Ryu style ninjutsu.

01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:42.426
We've got to stop him. I'll call Lt. Dime.

01:02:45.405 --> 01:02:47.635
This is no job for the police.

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:50.907
It's something I'll have to do.

01:02:52.146 --> 01:02:54.376
Only a ninja can stop a ninja.

01:02:54.915 --> 01:02:56.780
You're going after him?

01:02:56.984 --> 01:02:59.680
Let me come with you. I know I can help.

01:02:59.987 --> 01:03:01.352
No, friend.

01:03:02.122 --> 01:03:03.487
I'll do it.

01:03:04.225 --> 01:03:05.385
Alone.

01:03:07.127 --> 01:03:08.321
Please.

01:03:15.971 --> 01:03:17.734
What are you doing to me?

01:03:17.806 --> 01:03:21.469
You're a disappointment.
My trust in you is gone.

01:03:21.543 --> 01:03:24.068
You've shown too much compassion.

01:03:25.947 --> 01:03:28.848
Oh, my God, what have I done?

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:33.051
What do you want with him?

01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:36.557
He saw me.
So now he and his father must die.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.649
Don't kill Cho.

01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:43.297
-Please!
-Goodbye, Cathy.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.669
Okay.

01:08:33.265 --> 01:08:36.099
Hey, you! What's going on down there?

01:09:04.232 --> 01:09:06.291
Hey, Jim, you see anything?

01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:20.034
That son of a bitch and Jap
can come anytime now.

01:11:20.106 --> 01:11:22.336
You can stop an army with that bad bitch.

01:11:23.242 --> 01:11:25.642
Caifano takes care of his family.

01:11:28.215 --> 01:11:30.080
Son of a bitch ninja.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.981
We don't need the police.
We don't need you!

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:38.354
-I'm coming in.
-We don't need....

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.469
Hold it.

01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:36.275
Hey, look, Superman!

01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:55.695
<i>-23rd Precinct.
-Hello, police?</i>

01:13:56.902 --> 01:14:00.065
I've got to speak to Lt. Dime,
it's an emergency.

01:14:03.943 --> 01:14:05.672
Nobody's gonna come around here.

01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:07.975
They keep saying
somebody'll come get him.

01:14:08.047 --> 01:14:09.708
Been here all day.

01:14:14.153 --> 01:14:15.484
What the....

01:14:21.794 --> 01:14:24.422
Donny, check the noise in the hallway.

01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:34.598
Get behind the goddamn bar, hurry up!
Eat some of this!

01:16:01.064 --> 01:16:02.929
Hey, man, you're late.

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.724
But I got a piece of him.

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:09.804
Not bad, first time out.

01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:51.383
Come on, hurry up!

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.264
Daddy!

01:26:22.642 --> 01:26:23.734
Kane!
