EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

15 ARTISTS WERE FIGHTING
TO PROVE ONCE

00:06.881 --> 00:10.260
AND FOR ALL THAT THEY
ARE BETTER THAN THEIR RIVALS.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.261
- STOP BEING A PUSSY, MAN.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.850
announcer: IN THE FLASH
CHALLENGE, THE ARTISTS

00:16.933 --> 00:18.893
HAD TO FIGHT FOR CANVASES.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.979
- ONLY FOUR OF YOU WILL TATTOO.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.772
THE CANVASES WILL CHOOSE
THE ARTIST

00:22.856 --> 00:24.357
THEY WANT TO BE TATTOOED BY.

00:24.441 --> 00:24.983
- WE GOT TO SELL OURSELVES.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.568
- WHAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY?

00:26.651 --> 00:27.944
- IF THERE WAS A STYLE

00:28.027 --> 00:30.071
CALLED "AWESOME TATTOOS,"
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.906
- I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD
OF A TATTOOER YOU ARE.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.950

WITH THIS TATTOO.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.125
AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING THIS TIME.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.044
- EMILY'S GOING OUT OF HER WAY
TO WAKE THE BEAST

00:45.128 --> 00:45.837

00:48.214 --> 00:49.174
TIM, MARK,

00:49.257 --> 00:51.259
AND CRIS
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.136
- CRIS.
- IT LOOKS LIKE A MESS.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.138
SERIOUSLY,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.348
- MARK.
- THIS TATTOO IS ROUGH.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.391
BLOWOUTS, CHEWED-UP SKIN.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.019
- AND ALL THE MEDITATION
AND TAKING YOURSELF

01:01.102 --> 01:03.062
OUT OF THE MOMENT, MAYBE YOU GOT
TO BE IN THE MOMENT.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.313
- TIM.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.065
- REALLY, IT COMES DOWN
TO THE BODY OF WORK.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.609
- HOW MANY MORE HITS?

01:07.692 --> 01:10.195
HOW MANY MORE TIMES
IN THE BOTTOM IS IT GONNA TAKE?

01:10.278 --> 01:14.199

03:39.427 --> 03:41.971

GUEST JUDGE.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.223
THE OWNER OF COBRA TATTOO
IN MASSACHUSETTS,

03:44.307 --> 03:47.435
HIS CUSTOM DESIGN WORK
HAS MADE HIM LEGENDARY--

03:47.518 --> 03:50.229
FORREST CAVACCO.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.273
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN AROUND TATTOOING
SINCE I'M 15 YEARS OLD.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.735
THIS ISN'T JUST A TREND
TO THOSE OF US THAT CARE.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.654
THIS IS OUR LIFE.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.613
IF I SEE SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE,

03:58.696 --> 04:02.784
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA VOICE
MY OPINION.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.078
- I AM SO EXCITED
THAT FORREST IS HERE THIS WEEK.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.081
HE'S BEEN IN OUR INDUSTRY
FOR YEARS.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.667
I MEAN,
HE'S LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY

04:10.750 --> 04:13.920
A GIANT IN THIS INDUSTRY.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.630
- THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DIMENSION.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.923
- DIMENSION IS MAKING SOMETHING

04:18.007 --> 04:19.550
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FLAT
LOOK NOT FLAT.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.761
{\an8}IT'S ABOUT BRINGING SOMETHING
OFF THE SKIN VISUALLY,

04:21.844 --> 04:24.263
{\an8}SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD JUST
REACH IN AND TOUCH IT.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.890
- FOR TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,

04:25.974 --> 04:31.229
YOU MUST SANDBLAST A DESIGN
ONTO SEVEN PANES OF GLASS.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.563
TO SHOW DIMENSION,

04:32.647 --> 04:35.525
YOU MUST DIVIDE YOUR DESIGN
INTO BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.026
THEN ETCH A DIFFERENT PART
OF THE DESIGN

04:37.110 --> 04:39.696
ONTO EACH PANE OF GLASS.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.657
AND WHEN THE TIME IS UP, YOU
MUST CAREFULLY STACK THE PANES

04:42.740 --> 04:46.160
SO THAT THEY COME TO LIFE AS ONE
THREE-DIMENSIONAL ILLUSION.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.454
{\an8}- I'VE NEVER WORKED WITH GLASS.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.331
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE SO HARD
TO SHOW DIMENSION.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.500
{\an8}- I'M SUPER PUMPED.
I'VE GOT THREE SANDBLASTERS

04:52.583 --> 04:53.960
{\an8}AT HOME.
I'M READY FOR THIS.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.463
{\an8}- ONCE AGAIN,
YOU MUST WORK IN TEAMS OF TWO.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.466
{\an8}- THE ONLY PERSON I DON'T WANT
TO BE PAIRED UP WITH IS EMILY.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.470
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE
LIKE PUTTING A LION IN A CAGE

05:04.554 --> 05:04.971
WITH A FREAKING CHICKEN,

05:05.054 --> 05:07.015
AND I'M A LION.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.599
- THE WINNERS OF THE FLASH
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

05:08.683 --> 05:11.811
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES
AT THE ELIMINATION TATTOO

05:11.894 --> 05:13.980
AS A TEAM.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.315
JASON, YOU WON
THE LAST ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.859
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN THE TEAMS,

05:17.942 --> 05:20.486
SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.907
{\an8}- I WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE BIG
DOGS IN THIS COMPETITION.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.993
I WANT TO PAIR BOTTOM
AND THE TOP.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.369
IF YOU GET PAIRED UP
WITH AN ARTIST

05:28.453 --> 05:30.413
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME
MINDSET OR DESIGN SKILLS,

05:30.496 --> 05:33.374
YOU'RE GONNA
SCREW THE WHOLE DAMN THING UP.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.168
- ARTISTS,
PLEASE READ THE NUMBER

05:35.251 --> 05:37.587
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL
TO DETERMINE YOUR TEAM.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.088
- NUMBER ONE.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.299
- NUMBER FOUR.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.633
- FIVE.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.844
{\an8}- I JUST HOPE JASON
DOESN'T PUT ME WITH CRIS.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.888
HE CAN NEVER TAKE ANYTHING
SERIOUS.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.347
I DON'T NEED
TO CARRY DEAD WEIGHT.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.141
I NEED THIS UPPER HAND.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.477
- FIVE.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.228
- NUMBER ONE.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.105
- FOUR.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.523
- NUMBER TWO.
- TWO.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.442
{\an8}- I JUST WANT TO DO
MY OWN THING, MAN.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.444
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER PERSON
RIDING MY COATTAILS

06:01.527 --> 06:02.445
LIKE TIM WAS.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.739
- SEVEN.
- LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.116
- THREE.
- THREE.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.243
- SIX.
- SIX.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.287
{\an8}- JULIA HAD AN ACCIDENT
WITH HER EYE,

06:11.370 --> 06:14.499
{\an8}SO SHE CAN'T [bleep] SEE.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.583
- JASON WAS TRYING TO SCREW ME

06:15.666 --> 06:16.959
WITH THIS SKULL PICK,
BUT GUESS WHAT?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.169
I'M GONNA TAKE CONTROL,

06:18.252 --> 06:20.797
AND I'M GONNA CREATE SOMETHING
AMAZING SO THAT I CAN WIN.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.964
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.
YOU HAVE TWO HOURS,

06:22.048 --> 06:25.843
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.974
{\an8}- THE ARTISTS TODAY
HAVE TO SHOW DIMENSION

06:32.058 --> 06:34.644
{\an8}THROUGH THE DIFFERENT PANES
OF GLASS.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.647
IF THEY DON'T SEPARATE
EACH PANE, IT WON'T READ.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.273
THESE ARTISTS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK TOGETHER WELL AS A TEAM

06:39.357 --> 06:42.527
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHOW
DIMENSION,

06:42.610 --> 06:43.945
OR IT'S GONNA FALL FLAT.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.907
- DID YOU WANT TO PUT
A COUPLE CHUNKS ON HERE?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.659
- YEAH, LET'S PUT ONE--
LET'S PUT ONE CHUNK

06:49.742 --> 06:50.952
THAT KIND OF COMES OFF THE EDGE.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.161
- I ALIGN MYSELF WITH CLEEN,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.621
THE TOP DOG IN THIS COMPETITION,
FOR A REASON.

06:53.704 --> 06:58.668
{\an8}I NEED TO KNOW MY OPPONENT
IN ORDER TO BEAT MY OPPONENT.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.877
I'M DOING SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.338
IF I CAN JUST KEEP
THIS MOMENTUM,

07:02.421 --> 07:04.715
I SEE MYSELF GOING RIGHT
TO THE TOP OF THE PACK.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.010
- YOU WANT TO START CUTTING?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.720
- I'M NOT EVEN POSITIVE
ON WHAT YOU WANT TO CUT.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.598
- THIS WILL BE GLASS STILL.
THIS WILL BE ALL ETCH.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.599
{\an8}- I'M GLAD I GOT TY'ESHA
AS A TEAMMATE,

07:13.683 --> 07:15.852
{\an8}'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T BRING A LOT
TO THE TABLE.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.395
{\an8}SHE'LL BE
MY PERFECT LITTLE HELPER.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.730
- KILLING ME,
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.191
- I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE
PERFECT WAVE SINCE I GOT HERE.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.694
INSTEAD, I'VE BEEN RIDING A
HURRICANE FULL OF BULL[bleep].

07:24.777 --> 07:27.155
WE'RE GONNA RIDE THIS WAVE
ALL THE WAY TO SKULL PICKS.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.072
YOU GOT TO GET
STARTED GOING FASTER.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.365
- YES, SIR.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.039
- LET'S DO ANOTHER PANE
WITH A FEW MORE.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.542
TWO HERE, TWO HERE--

07:39.625 --> 07:40.501
- IT'LL BE ATTACK
OF THE [bleep] BIRDS.

07:40.585 --> 07:44.213
{\an8}- I'M TOTALLY OVER WORKING
WITH ANGEL...

07:44.297 --> 07:46.174
{\an8}BUT AFTER WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK,

07:46.257 --> 07:48.301
{\an8}I HAVE TO REDEEM MYSELF
IN THE EYES OF THE JUDGES.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.385
- THE COMPOSITION
ON THIS IS ROUGH.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.388
- HONESTLY, MAN,
I GAVE UP BEFORE I STARTED.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.639
- WE CAN GIVE UP RIGHT NOW,

07:53.723 --> 07:55.308
AND, LIKE,
SPARE EVERYBODY THE CRITIQUE

07:55.391 --> 07:57.101
AND SEND YOU PACKING NOW.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.269
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAND OUT
ON THIS FLASH CHALLENGE,

07:58.352 --> 08:01.230
SO WE'RE ONLY USING FIVE PANES
OF GLASS.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.357
I KNOW EVERYONE ELSE
IS GONNA BE DOING SEVEN PANES,

08:03.441 --> 08:05.276
AND IT'S JUST GONNA
BE WAY TOO CLUTTERED AND MESSY.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.613
- ONE HOUR REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.416
{\an8}- NEW YORK CITY
IS LOADED WITH DIMENSION.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.793
BUILDINGS IN THE FAR OFF
DISTANCE, AND IN THE MID-GROUND,

08:22.877 --> 08:23.878
RIGHT IN THE FOREGROUND,
I'M GONNA FRAME IT OUT,

08:23.961 --> 08:26.339
AND I'M GONNA
LAY SOME DOPE CLOUDS BEHIND IT.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.091
IF WE PULL IT OFF,
WE'VE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.260
{\an8}- HIT THAT CIRCLE ONE MORE TIME.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.763
{\an8}- IT'S HARD TO TELL
IF WE'RE EVEN.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.725
{\an8}- EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO DO
THESE MASTERPIECES OF IMAGERY

08:37.808 --> 08:38.433
{\an8}AND CLUTTERED BULL[bleep],

08:38.517 --> 08:39.602
{\an8}AND THEY'RE GONNA MISS THE MARK.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.563
THE EASIEST WAY TO SHOW
DIMENSION IN THIS CHALLENGE

08:42.647 --> 08:45.274
IS TO GO CLEAN
AND SIMPLE AND DIRECT.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.360
- FIVE, FOUR,

08:47.443 --> 08:50.363
THREE, TWO, ONE.

08:50.446 --> 08:54.492
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE SANDBLASTING.

08:56.911 --> 09:01.290
- CLEEN AND JASON'S DESIGN IS
NOT A DIMENSIONAL IMAGE AT ALL.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.709
{\an8}IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT
YOU'D SEE IN A COLORING BOOK.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.045
JASON ONCE AGAIN
IS JUST PROVING THAT MY RIVAL

09:06.128 --> 09:08.714
IS NOT AS BIG OF A THREAT
AS HE THINKS HE IS.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.803
- EMILY AND RYAN.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.472
- YOU HIT THE DIMENSION
REALLY WELL WITH THE RAYS

09:16.555 --> 09:18.140
PLAYING BACK AND FORTH WITH SOME
OF THE CLOUDS IN THE FOREGROUND,

09:18.224 --> 09:20.476
SOME IN THE BACKGROUND.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.728
THE LAST LAYER OF CLOUDS YOU DID
ALL THE WAY BEHIND EVERYTHING

09:22.812 --> 09:27.316
IS WHAT REALLY PUSHES THE MOTION
FORWARD AND SHOWS ITS DIMENSION.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.693
- ERIK AND ROBBIE.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.111
- I THINK IT'S TOO SIMPLISTIC.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.321
IT IS A LITTLE REPETITIOUS
WITH THE FLAMES.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.197
IT DOESN'T SHOW DIMENSION
AS GREAT AS SOME

09:33.281 --> 09:35.366
OF THE OTHER THINGS.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.576
- HAD YOU PUT SOMETHING
DIFFERENT IN THE BACKGROUND,

09:37.660 --> 09:40.663
IT COULD'VE CREATED
MORE DIMENSION.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.164
JASON AND CLEEN.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.833
YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY NICE
DIMENSION

09:43.916 --> 09:45.167
WITH THE MOUNTAIN SCAPE,

09:45.251 --> 09:48.004
BUT ALSO WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE
IS THAT WITHIN THE BONSAI,

09:48.087 --> 09:49.672
YOU'VE GOT LAYERS
OF FOLIAGE THERE.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.632
- I DO LIKE THE BORDER
THAT YOU PUT IN THERE A LOT.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.842
THE SHADOW THAT IT DROPS,

09:52.925 --> 09:56.053
ESPECIALLY ON THE SUN,
REALLY PUSHES THE DIMENSION OUT.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.806
- JULIA AND JOSH.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.808
- YOU DEFINITELY CAPTURED
DIMENSION.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.518
I LOVE THE WAY THE BEAMS COME
ACROSS THE HAMMERHEAD SHARK.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.313
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT TO READ.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.523
YOU'RE LAYERING THINGS
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER

10:07.606 --> 10:08.858
THAT GET IN THE WAY.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.526
{\an8}- THAT WAS INTENTIONAL
BECAUSE WHEN YOU

10:10.609 --> 10:12.028
{\an8}LOOK AT AN UNDERWATER PHOTO,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.238
{\an8}YOU DO HAVE TO LOOK
FOR SOME OF THE CREATURES.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.532
{\an8}- JOSH IS JUST A BIG PUSSY.

10:16.615 --> 10:17.325
YOU TRY TO GIVE HIM ANY KIND
OF CRITIQUE,

10:17.408 --> 10:19.452
HE HAS AN EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.704
IT'S BULL[bleep].

10:21.787 --> 10:23.080
- DON AND AARON.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.791
- THE MINIMAL APPROACH THAT YOU
TOOK TO GIVE US THE PERCEPTION

10:25.875 --> 10:28.210
OF DEPTH IN THE PIECE
IS WHAT STANDS OUT ON THIS.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.546
IT'S A NICE JOB.

10:30.629 --> 10:31.839
- TY'ESHA AND MARK.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.758
- YOU GET THAT REALLY NICE
DIMENSION FROM THE SHADOWS,

10:33.841 --> 10:35.551
FROM THE DIFFERENT ETCHINGS
ONTO THE SAND.

10:35.634 --> 10:38.471
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT BUSY,
BUT OVERALL,

10:38.554 --> 10:42.350
THERE REALLY IS A NICE SENSE
OF DIMENSION IN THIS THING.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.644
- CRIS AND ANGEL.
- THE CAST SHADOW THAT YOU GET

10:44.727 --> 10:46.687
FROM THE ACTUAL SUBJECT MATTER
IN THE FOREGROUND

10:46.771 --> 10:48.731
REALLY DOES GIVE YOU
THAT COOL FEELING OF DEPTH,

10:48.814 --> 10:51.650
AND THE WAY
THAT YOU STACKED THE CITIES,

10:51.734 --> 10:54.111
WHERE YOU HAVE THE CLOUDS
COMING BEHIND THE SILHOUETTES,

10:54.195 --> 10:56.364
REALLY LENDS ITSELF
TO GIVE SOME DEPTH TO THIS.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.199
NICE JOB.
- THANKS.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.200
{\an8}- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.951
{\an8}THAT THING LOOKS LIKE A PIECE
OF [bleep].

11:01.035 --> 11:03.371
IT DOESN'T LOOK SHARP.
IT DOESN'T LOOK CLEAN.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.332
I JUST THINK
IT'S VERY ELEMENTARY.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.542
- TODAY, WE'RE SHOWING DIMENSION
WITH GLASS BLASTING.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.336
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE TOP OF THE FIELD.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.464
AARON AND DON WHO DID
THE VERY SIMPLE GEOMETRIC STYLE.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.758
- IT REALLY ACHIEVES DIMENSION
WITHOUT GETTING TOO CRAZY.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.885
- THEY WERE CONSCIOUS
OF THEIR SUBJECT MATTER

11:17.968 --> 11:22.473
NOT OVERLAPPING TOO MUCH,
CREATING A PRETTY CLEAN IMAGE.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.267
- I LIKE THE CITYSCAPE
ON RYAN AND EMILY'S.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.645
- I LIKE HOW CLEAN IT IS.
I LIKE HOW READABLE IT IS.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.189
I LIKE THE VERY STRAIGHT LINES,
CONTRASTING.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.482
OVERALL,
I THINK THEY DID GREAT.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.608
- CRIS AND ANGEL,

11:32.692 --> 11:36.153
WHO DID NOT INCORPORATE
ALL SEVEN PANES OF GLASS.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.488
HOWEVER, I THINK IT MAY HAVE
WORKED TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.572
- THEY GOT RIGHT TO THE POINT.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.282
IT SHOWED DIMENSION
IN LESS PANES

11:40.366 --> 11:42.701
THAN ANYBODY ELSE USED.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.620
- OUT OF THESE TWO GUYS,
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

11:44.703 --> 11:46.872
THAT I WOULD NOT
EXPECT TO SEE THEM DO.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.790
THEY DID WELL.
- DO WE HAVE A DECISION?

11:47.873 --> 11:50.960
- I THINK SO.
- LET'S LET 'EM KNOW.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.423
TODAY, YOU HAD TO CREATE
A THREE-DIMENSIONAL DESIGN

11:55.506 --> 11:58.509
BY SANDBLASTING PANES OF GLASS.

11:58.592 --> 11:59.635
YOU ALL DID IMPRESSIVE WORK,

11:59.718 --> 12:01.637
BUT SOME OF YOUR DESIGNS
REALLY CAME TO LIFE.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.266
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNERS

12:05.349 --> 12:09.145
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE
ARE...

12:11.230 --> 12:12.898
CRIS AND ANGEL.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.030
- THERE'S GENIUS IN SIMPLICITY.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.200
YOU GOT DIMENSION OUT OF LESS.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.828
- YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

12:25.911 --> 12:29.373
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO
AS A TEAM.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.334
{\an8}- ANGEL AND CRIS'S LOOKS
UNFINISHED, IT'S CONFUSING.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.627
{\an8}THEY WEREN'T FINISHED.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.006
IT'S AN UNFINISHED PIECE THAT
JUST WON THIS GODDAMN CHALLENGE.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.007
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

12:38.090 --> 12:41.510
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE NEXT ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.054
- I PUT ALL OF OUR BULL[bleep]
TO THE SIDE AND GOT IT DONE.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.223
{\an8}AND NOW, ME AND ANGEL
NEED TO HAND OUT THESE SKULLS

12:46.307 --> 12:46.974
{\an8}AND MAKE IT COUNT.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.520
{\an8}- OH, [bleep] ME.
I'M SCREWED.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.689
{\an8}- THIS IS CALLED
LONG DISTANCE MIND [bleep].

12:53.772 --> 12:54.732
{\an8}- PUSSY.
- YOU ARE THE KING OF EXCUSES.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.903
- AND YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF BITCHY [bleep] TATTOOS.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.952
- NOW WE'RE AT THE POSITION
THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR,

13:07.036 --> 13:08.245
AND IT FEELS GOOD.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.039
- WE DEFINITELY KNOW
WHO WE'RE GOING AFTER.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.582
- I'M LOOKING AT JOSH.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.000
I'M LOOKING AT CLEEN.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.752
THESE ARE TOP DOGS NOW.
- THAT'S TRUE.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.630
- I HOPE YOU GUYS GUN
FOR SOMEONE WITH A BIG MOUTH.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.923
- WHO?

13:19.006 --> 13:20.007
- EMILY.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.760
SHE THINKS SHE'S GONNA
TAKE THIS HOME, YOU KNOW?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.637
- SHE'S NOT A THREAT, HONESTLY.
- SHE'S NOT A THREAT?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.305
- SHE GOT A BIG ASS [bleep]
MOUTH, BUT--

13:26.388 --> 13:27.556
- BUT SHE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN
SOME TIME OR ANOTHER.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.100
- EMILY GIVES ME
SO MUCH [bleep].

13:30.184 --> 13:32.353
SHE LITERALLY THINKS
I'M WEAKER THAN HER.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.896
IT'S TIME
TO FINALLY SHUT HER UP.

13:33.979 --> 13:34.897
- SO IF WE PUT YOU
UP AGAINST EMILY,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.149
YOU THINK YOU COULD BEAT HER?
- HELL YES.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.068
I WANT TO GO UP AGAINST HER;
I MEAN, THAT GIRL,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.402
BEING IN MY FACE,
I GOT TO PUT IT TO AN END,

13:40.486 --> 13:43.113
AND I GOT TO DO IT WITH MY WORK,
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA SIT THERE

13:43.197 --> 13:44.406
AND ARGUE WITH THIS GIRL
EVERY DAY.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.408
I'M OVER IT.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.674
- WELCOME TO
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:01.757 --> 14:05.594
IMPRESS US, AND YOU'LL BE
ONE STEP CLOSER TO $100,000,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.180
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.266
- YES.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.268
- OLIVER IS RUNNING
HIS TATTOO CONVENTION,

14:12.351 --> 14:14.770
SO HE WON'T BE JUDGING
THIS WEEK.

14:14.853 --> 14:18.983
HOWEVER, YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY FORREST CAVACCO, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

14:19.066 --> 14:19.942
AND MYSELF.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.360
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.280
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.782
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

14:26.865 --> 14:30.452
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOO
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM,

14:30.536 --> 14:33.247
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.083
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

14:36.166 --> 14:36.959
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

14:37.042 --> 14:41.130
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DIMENSION.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.840
- MAN.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.217
{\an8}- CREATING DIMENSION
IS TO MAKE YOUR TATTOO

14:45.301 --> 14:46.802
{\an8}LOOK LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY
POPPING OFF THE SKIN.

14:46.885 --> 14:50.055
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A BASIC TATTOO

14:50.139 --> 14:51.807
AND AN AMAZING TATTOO.

14:51.890 --> 14:52.808
- TODAY,

14:52.891 --> 14:55.269
YOU MUST TATTOO...

14:55.352 --> 14:56.395
AN ANIMAL.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.731
- OH.
- YES.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.232
{\an8}I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS CHALLENGE.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.609
{\an8}THIS IS THE IMAGERY THAT I LOVE.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.152
THIS IS THE IMAGERY THAT I DO.

15:03.235 --> 15:03.944
I KNOW I'M GONNA KILL IT.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.945
- FOR AN ANIMAL TO COME TO LIFE

15:05.029 --> 15:08.782
AND POP OFF THE SKIN,
FACES, NOSES, EYES,

15:08.866 --> 15:11.869
AND MOUTHS MUST HAVE DEPTH
AND DIMENSION.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.038
{\an8}- IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW
DIMENSION IN ANIMAL TATTOOS

15:14.121 --> 15:16.498
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT
TATTOO LOOK LIKE IT'S ALIVE.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.417
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE IT'S GONNA REACH OUT

15:18.500 --> 15:19.251
AND TOUCH YOU.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.919
- TODAY, ONCE AGAIN,
EVERY CANVAS

15:21.003 --> 15:23.797
WANTS THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER
AS ONE OTHER CANVAS.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.426
THAT MEANS YOU'LL ALL BE
GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD

15:27.509 --> 15:29.845
WITH ONE OTHER ARTIST.

15:29.928 --> 15:30.512
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,

15:30.596 --> 15:33.349
BUT ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.850
{\an8}- I WANT TO FACE OFF
WITH EMILY SO BAD.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.478
{\an8}IF CRIS AND ANGEL
PAIR ME UP WITH HER,

15:37.561 --> 15:38.854
{\an8}I'M GONNA SEND HER PACKING.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.106
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.362
ANGEL AND CRIS,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.658
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL HUMAN CANVASES TOGETHER.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.618
ONCE AGAIN,
BY ASSIGNING THE SKULLS,

15:52.701 --> 15:55.704
YOU ARE DETERMINING
WHO TATTOOS HEAD-TO-HEAD.

15:55.788 --> 16:00.376
YOUR CHOICES WILL DETERMINE
YOUR FATE, SO BE STRATEGIC.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.669
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA PUT TOP DOG
AGAINST TOP DOG,

16:01.752 --> 16:04.088
{\an8}THE BOTTOM AGAINST THE BOTTOM.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.298
I'M DYING
TO CAUSE A TRAIN WRECK.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.466
- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO GET?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.093
- A COLORED TIGER ON MY BACK.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.511
- AND WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
TO DO?

16:10.594 --> 16:13.180
{\an8}- A COLOR TIGER FACE ON MY CALF.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.723
{\an8}- WE REALLY WANT TO SCREW
OVER JOSH

16:14.807 --> 16:16.767
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
AN ANNOYING KNOW-IT-ALL

16:16.850 --> 16:18.394
{\an8}THIS WHOLE COMPETITION.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.937
{\an8}I WANT TO SEE HIM AT THE BOTTOM.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.897
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GET A PORTRAIT
OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S HORSE.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.733
{\an8}- A CHESTNUT COLOR MUSTANG.

16:24.817 --> 16:29.446
{\an8}- THERE'S NO WAY TO DO
A BROWN HORSE ON BROWN SKIN.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.907
THAT'S GONNA
LOSE DIMENSION RIGHT THERE.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.158
- LOOKING FOR A VICIOUS GRIZZLY
BEAR ON MY CALF.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.122
- FEROCIOUS GRIZZLY BEAR
ON MY RIBS.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.081
- OOH.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.040
- [laughing]

16:40.124 --> 16:43.752
{\an8}- BEAR AND RIBS
IN THE SAME SENTENCE?

16:43.836 --> 16:44.920
OOH, THIS IS TOO GOOD.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.214
I ALREADY KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE THAT'S GOING.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.431
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

16:55.514 --> 16:59.143
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.310
- ERIK.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.729
- VERSUS...

17:01.812 --> 17:05.190
- JASON.
- OOH.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.525
- CRIS.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.651
- AARON.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.694
- OOH, ROUND TWO.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.195
- I'M GOING UP AGAINST AARON

17:11.280 --> 17:12.781
BECAUSE I HAVE A SCORE
TO SETTLE.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.532
{\an8}HE WON OUR LAST CHALLENGE,

17:14.616 --> 17:17.327
{\an8}AND I WANT TO PROVE
THAT I'M A BETTER TATTOO ARTIST.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.704
- DON.

17:19.788 --> 17:20.873
- ROBBIE.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.583
- ROCK AND ROLL.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.422
- RYAN.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.299
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA BE STUPID HARD

17:30.382 --> 17:34.052
{\an7}TO DO A CHESTNUT COLORED HORSE
ON A CHESTNUT COLORED SKIN TONE.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.929
IT'S GONNA BE A NIGHTMARE.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.347
- ANGEL.
all: OOH.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.974
- SHOTS FIRED.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.269
- ME AND RYAN, WE ARE IN THE
SAME PLACE IN THIS COMPETITION.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.479
I GOT TO TAKE HIM OUT.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.399
{\an8}IT'S JUST KNOCKING ONE DOWN
AT A TIME.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.942
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

17:49.026 --> 17:49.651
- THAT'S IT.
- IS THAT THE BEAR?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.111
- GRIZZLY BEAR.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.368
- JOSH.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.412
{\an8}- IT'S THAT ONE.
- THAT'S THE GOOD PICK.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.832
{\an8}- I'M GONNA CRUSH JOSH IN THIS.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.751
{\an8}I DON'T THINK
HE STANDS A CHANCE.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.753
- MARK.
- CHAKA.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.671
- JULIA.
- WOW.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.217
- TY'ESHA.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.181
- EMILY.
- HI, HONEY.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.432
- KICK HER ASS.
- THAT'S GOOD.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.226
{\an8}- THIS IS THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.019
{\an8}I AM READY TO GO.

18:24.102 --> 18:27.314
EMILY IS NOT BETTER THAN ME,
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.440
- I'M GOING TO ANNIHILATE YOU.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.859
- RAWR.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.487
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:33.570 --> 18:35.906
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

18:35.989 --> 18:37.157
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

18:37.241 --> 18:39.868
AND PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.412
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO AN ANIMAL

18:42.496 --> 18:45.374
SO LIFELIKE,
IT POPS OFF THE SKIN,

18:45.457 --> 18:46.750
AND BASED ON YOUR WORK,

18:46.834 --> 18:50.003
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.755
- OKAY...

18:51.839 --> 18:54.091
- SO GOOD LUCK.

18:54.174 --> 18:58.220
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO HAVE DIMENSION
TO SHOW TEXTURE AND DEPTH.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.430
OTHERWISE, IT'S GONNA
LOOK BORING AND LIFELESS.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.765
- FEROCIOUS LOOKING GORILLA,
YES?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.267
- YES.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.893
- IF YOU DON'T USE DIMENSION
IN THIS, YOU'RE GONE.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.688
- YOU WANT A BEAR?
- YES.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.147
- ON THE BACK OF YOUR CALF?
- YEAH.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.024
I MEAN, I'M OPEN
TO WHERE IT'S GONNA LOOK BEST.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.776
- YEAH, OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.195
- NORMALLY, WE'D TRY
TO TALK YOU OUT OF DOING RIBS.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.905
{\an8}I GET ANOTHER RIB TATTOO.
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A [bleep].

19:16.989 --> 19:19.867
IF I CAN'T DO
A SIX-HOUR BADASS BEAR

19:19.950 --> 19:20.742
ON YOUR RIBS, THEN I SHOULDN'T
[bleep] BE HERE.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.119
- WELL, LET'S DO IT.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.330
- THEY'RE DEFINITELY
WASTING A HARD SKULL ON ME.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.498
- RIGHT HERE?
- YEAH.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.583
- THEY SHOULD JUST GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,

19:27.666 --> 19:28.834
THEN WATCH THEM FALL
ON THEIR FACE.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.627
[bleep] YEAH.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.629
- VERY DARK.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.840
{\an8}APPARENTLY, MY CANVAS
HAS A PHOTO REFERENCE.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.717
{\an8}I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.052
ALL DETAILS ARE LOST.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.929
THE PHOTO WAS JUST TOO SMALL.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.723
THE IMAGE IS ABOUT THE SIZE
OF A QUARTER.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.266
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE CAN PULL.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.517
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.102
- IT MAKES IT
A LOT MORE DIFFICULT.

19:47.185 --> 19:50.355
WHAT THE [bleep]?
OH, [bleep] ME.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.900
THIS IS REALLY GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.276
I'M SCREWED.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.952
- YOU READY?
- PUTTING ME AND CLEEN TOGETHER

20:04.036 --> 20:05.412
IS GONNA BE LIKE
THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.414
IT'S TWO TOP RUNNERS
IN THIS COMPETITION,

20:07.497 --> 20:08.457
AND I'M GONNA NAIL IT.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.169
OH, BOY.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.045
KIND OF A TOUGH PLACE
TO TATTOO IT.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.965
'CAUSE IT'S JUST SO BIG.
UM...

20:17.049 --> 20:17.799
IF YOU HAD ANOTHER PLACE
THAT WE COULD PUT IT,

20:17.883 --> 20:19.259
WHERE WOULD YOU CONSIDER?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.803
- HEY, JOSH,
YOU'RE NOT CHANGING THE LOCATION

20:21.887 --> 20:22.971
OF THAT TATTOO, ARE YOU?
- I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.515
HE JUST LOST, LIKE, 70 POUNDS.
HIS SKIN IS REALLY LOOSE.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.436
IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR ME
TO TATTOO THIS AREA ON HIS BODY.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.731
- I'M WATCHING THIS TRICKERY
GO DOWN RIGHT HERE.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.483
HE'S TRYING
TO CONVINCE HIS CANVAS

20:34.566 --> 20:37.110
TO GET IT SOMEWHERE EASIER
TO TATTOO.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.404
- I DON'T MIND IT HERE,
ON THIS LEG.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.240
- I THOUGHT HE WANTED IT
ON HIS RIBS.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.492
- YEAH, RIGHT, AND IT'S
WAY HARDER TO TATTOO ON RIBS.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.576
- THAT'S [bleep] UP.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.869
- YOU'RE WITNESSING
THIS RIGHT HERE.

20:45.953 --> 20:46.536
- IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE WAY THE TATTOO LOOKS.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.247
- YUP.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.333
{\an8}- THIS GUY IS THE MASTER OF
GETTING STUFF OUT OF THE RIBS.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.836
{\an8}I'M TELLING YOU,
JOSH IS A SKINNY LITTLE WORM.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.255
- WHAT IF IT WAS HERE?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.049
- OH, YEAH,
PUT IN A REAL EASY SPOT.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.759
- DUDE, IT'S A 13-HOUR
[bleep] TATTOO, MAN.

21:00.842 --> 21:01.969
- WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
IT A SIX-HOUR TATTOO?

21:02.052 --> 21:04.680
- BECAUSE THEN IT WON'T BE
AS GOOD AS THE 13-HOUR TATTOO.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.056
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.808
SKINNY LITTLE BASTARD.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.895
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO AN ANIMAL,

21:11.979 --> 21:15.899
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.317
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.027
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
- OH, YEAH, MAN.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.529
{\an8}- ANIMALS ARE TOUGH FOR A LOT
OF ARTISTS

21:20.612 --> 21:23.782
{\an8}BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
DIFFERENT TEXTURES FOR FEATHERS.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.201
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU HAVE
TO REALLY GO ABOUT EXECUTING

21:26.284 --> 21:29.579
THAT TAKE A LOT OF TRICKS TO
LAY DOWN A DIMENSIONAL TATTOO.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.748
- YOU READY?
- YEAH.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.089
{\an8}- I'M REALLY STOKED TO BE GOING
UP AGAINST ANGEL RIGHT NOW,

21:39.172 --> 21:41.383
{\an8}BUT I REALLY WANTED THE BLACK
AND GRAY HORSE.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.884
MY CANVAS WANTS
A BROWNISH MUSTANG HORSE

21:42.968 --> 21:45.387
ON THE BACK OF HER SHOULDER.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.263
TO TRY AND PRODUCE
THE SAME SKIN TONES

21:46.346 --> 21:49.057
THAT SHE HAS ALREADY
ON THIS HORSE--

21:49.141 --> 21:51.518
IT'S JUST GONNA BE SO DIFFICULT.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.979
- JUST THE RIGHT CONTRAST,
BUT THE WRONG [bleep] SIZE.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.897
MY CANVAS
HAS A PHOTO REFERENCE,

21:55.981 --> 21:57.315
BUT IT'S ONLY THAT BIG.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.984
I MANEUVERED.
I TWEAKED.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.402
SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.070
PULLED OUT THE LINE WORK.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.363
- I LOVE IT.
THAT'S PERFECT.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.531
- ALL RIGHT.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.241
{\an8}- SHE'S VERY HAPPY
WITH WHAT I DREW UP.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.075
I HAVE ARTISTIC SKILL.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.578
THAT'S MY STRONG POINT.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.830
RYAN NEEDS TO WATCH OUT FOR ME.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.249
- THIS IS CALLED
LONG DISTANCE MIND [bleep].

22:14.332 --> 22:15.542
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, BOY?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.836
- REALLY, NOW?
[bleep] PUSSY.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.046
- FIVE HOURS, EVERYBODY.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.839
FIVE HOURS TO GO.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.383
[tools buzzing]

22:23.467 --> 22:26.344
{\an8}- THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO TAKE EMILY DOWN.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.097
{\an8}I WANT TO BEAT HER
MORE THAN ANYBODY.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.187
{\an8}- YOURS LOOKS WAY BETTER.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.147
- WORKING
IN THE TATTOOING INDUSTRY,

22:37.230 --> 22:41.777
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MISJUDGED
AND UNDERESTIMATED AS A FEMALE,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.737
NATIVE AMERICAN LESBIAN.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.739
I WANT TO PROVE TO ANYONE
WHO'S EVER DOUBTED ME

22:45.822 --> 22:47.866
AND TOLD ME NO,
THAT I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.910
LOOK WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.
LOOK WHERE I AM TODAY.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.413
{\an8}- I KNOW I CAN BEAT TY'ESHA.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.541
EVERY LINE,
EVERY BIT OF SHADING,

22:56.625 --> 22:58.043
EVERY HAIR
ON THAT STUPID GORILLA

22:58.126 --> 23:01.254
IS JUST COVERED IN FLAWS.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.714
BYE-BYE, TY, TY.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.593
- THREE HOURS TO GO.

23:11.389 --> 23:11.973
{\an8}- I CAN'T LOSE TO JULIA.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.184
{\an8}I'M A 20-YEAR VET.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.060
JULIA'S ONLY BEEN IN THE GAME
FOR FIVE YEARS.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.312
IF I GO HOME BEFORE JULIA,

23:17.395 --> 23:19.022
THAT'S GONNA BE
SOME REAL BULL[bleep].

23:20.899 --> 23:23.443
WE GOT THIS.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.446
I NEED TO BEAT MARK,
WHO IS A VETERAN TATTOO ARTIST,

23:26.530 --> 23:28.323
AND SHOW PEOPLE
THAT I'M A SERIOUS COMPETITOR.

23:28.406 --> 23:31.493
{\an8}I'M GOING TO GET THE RESPECT
THAT I DESERVE.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.328
{\an8}HAVE YOU SEEN MARK'S YET?

23:33.411 --> 23:36.498
{\an8}- YEAH. HE'S NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO BEING DONE.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.541
{\an8}- FINAL HOUR, EVERYBODY.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.838
- TODAY'S THE JAPANESE BOYS
BATTLE.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.090
- THE LAST TIME
I WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH ERIK,

23:45.173 --> 23:46.466
I ENDED UP LOSING.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.467
IT SUCKED.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.343
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO REDEEM MYSELF

23:48.426 --> 23:52.764
AND PROVE
THAT I'M A BETTER TATTOOER.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.182
- HE'S ALREADY COMING
OUT OF THE SKIN.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.519
THERE'S A STORM A-BREWING.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.353
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE?

23:58.436 --> 24:00.605
{\an8}- GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST CLEEN,

24:00.689 --> 24:01.898
{\an8}I DON'T SEE HIM AS A THREAT.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.942
- SO YOU HAVE JUST,
LIKE, ANOTHER 10 OR 15 MINUTES'

24:04.025 --> 24:05.527
WORTH OF WORK TO DO?
- IF THAT.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.361
I GOT SOME WHITE HIGHLIGHTS
TO DO, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.656
{\an8}I CAN DUPLICATE
REALISTIC IMAGES

24:09.739 --> 24:12.617
{\an8}LIKE NOBODY ELSE THAT I KNOW.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.244
{\an8}- IT LOOKS GOOD.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.874
- TEN, NINE,

24:18.957 --> 24:20.876
EIGHT, SEVEN,

24:20.959 --> 24:22.878
SIX, FIVE,

24:22.961 --> 24:24.921
FOUR, THREE,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.591
TWO, ONE.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.217
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.510
MACHINES DOWN.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.137
NO MORE TATTOOING.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.724
- WE ARE FINISHED.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.434
- YOU KILLED IT.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.936
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S WILD, MAN.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.314
- I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE
"OH, MY GOD" WAS GOOD OR BAD.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.233
- NO, MAN, THAT'S CRAZY.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.735
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

24:46.818 --> 24:50.030
{\an8}- WHY WOULD YOU PUT A MUSHROOM
CLOUD WITH A ANIMAL TATTOO?

24:50.113 --> 24:51.573
{\an8}IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.325
- IT'S PERFECT.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.911
- JOSH MADE
THE STUPIDEST DECISION EVER.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.662
I DON'T THINK THIS GUYS' GOT
AN ORIGINAL BONE IN HIS BODY.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.833
{\an8}- IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER

25:01.917 --> 25:04.252
{\an8}TO JUSTIFY YOU
IN THIS COMPETITION.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.295
{\an8}- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

25:05.378 --> 25:06.421
{\an8}- IT'S CRAZY.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.340
- I WORKED SO [bleep] HARD
FOR THIS [bleep].

25:08.423 --> 25:12.010
I'M NOT [bleep] READY FOR IT.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.184
- I THINK YOU DID A NICE TATTOO,

25:19.267 --> 25:21.061
BUT I DEFINITELY THINK
I HAD MORE DIMENSION.

25:21.144 --> 25:24.856
- WELL, I'M JUST CURIOUS.
WHY'D YOU MOVE FROM THE RIBS?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.524
- THERE'S NO WAY
I WOULD'VE PUT A TATTOO,

25:26.608 --> 25:28.610
ANY TATTOO, ON THAT GUY'S RIBS
IN SIX HOURS.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.820
- I GAVE YOU RIBS,
AND YOU PUSSIED OUT OF IT.

25:30.904 --> 25:31.696
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING A PUSSY

25:31.780 --> 25:33.448
AND MAKING
A PROFESSIONAL DECISION

25:33.531 --> 25:35.825
THAT'S GONNA GIVE A PERSON
A GOOD TATTOO.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.702
- DUDE, IT HAS "BOGUS"
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.746
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU HAVE A [bleep] ASS TAT,

25:39.829 --> 25:40.747
SO YOU SHOULD JUST SHUT UP.
- YOU WANT TO

25:40.830 --> 25:42.791
TALK ABOUT DIMENSION?
- YOUR TATTOO SUCKS.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.876
- YOURS IS AS FLAT
AS A [bleep] PANCAKE.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.754
- YEAH, BUT YOURS IS [bleep],
AND MINE IS TATTOOED WELL.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.422
- YOU ARE THE KING OF EXCUSES.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.298
- AND YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF BITCHY [bleep] TATTOOS.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.759
- I'M A VERY TALENTED
TATTOO ARTIST.

25:52.842 --> 25:53.927
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T...

25:54.010 --> 25:56.596
- BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH.
- GONE HOME YET, JOSH.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.861
- TODAY, YOU HAD
TO USE DIMENSION

26:11.945 --> 26:12.696
TO BRING ANIMALS TO LIFE.

26:12.779 --> 26:15.115
EACH OF YOU TATTOOED
HEAD-TO-HEAD

26:15.198 --> 26:16.449
WITH ANOTHER ARTIST,

26:16.533 --> 26:17.659
AND WE WILL DIRECTLY
COMPARE YOUR WORK.

26:17.742 --> 26:22.664
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.002
JOSH, LET'S START WITH YOU.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.795
CRIS AND ANGEL
PUT YOU UP AGAINST CLEEN.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.046
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

26:30.130 --> 26:32.007
- IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME TO TRULY COMPETE

26:32.090 --> 26:33.508
AGAINST SOMEBODY
THAT COULD DO GOOD ARTWORK.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.343
- TECHNICALLY,
YOU ARE SOUND,

26:35.427 --> 26:37.637
BUT IT'S NOT THE MOST LEGIBLE,
READABLE TATTOO.

26:37.721 --> 26:38.847
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

26:38.930 --> 26:41.016
LOOK JUST LIKE
WHAT THE MUSHROOM EXPLOSION IS.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.434
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.894
IT'S A BEAR WEARING A PARTY HAT
OR A BEAR IN A LAVA LAMP.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.855
- SIMPLE FACT IS
IT CREATES COOL IMAGERY.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.857
DO YOU REALLY, LIKE, PROBE EVERY
ARTIST THAT PAINTS SOMETHING,

26:48.940 --> 26:50.400
AND SAY, "WHY THE HELL
DID YOU PUT THAT IN THERE?"

26:50.483 --> 26:51.860
YOU JUST LOOK AT IT,
AND YOU GO, "HEY."

26:51.943 --> 26:52.694
- NO, BUT EVERY ARTIST
THAT PAINTS SOMETHING

26:52.777 --> 26:54.571
ISN'T IN THIS COMPETITION,
EITHER.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.447
- I WOULDN'T GO DOING ALL THIS

26:55.530 --> 26:57.532
EXTRA FRILLY [bleep]
IF I WAS YOU.

26:57.615 --> 27:00.368
YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO CAN COME IN AND DO

27:00.452 --> 27:02.203
A LEGIBLE, READABLE TATTOO
AND GET THE [bleep] OUT.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.664
THE CHOICES YOU MAKE, YOU
MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

27:04.748 --> 27:07.625
TO JUST GO,
"HERE YOU GO, CLEAR A WIN."

27:09.085 --> 27:11.212
- CLEEN.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.965
- YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH
THE TEXTURE AND THE FUR HERE.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.134
I LIKE WHAT YOU DID ON THE BACK,
BEHIND THE EAR.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.386
THAT DARK AREA,
I DO ACTUALLY LIKE IT DARK

27:18.470 --> 27:20.805
BECAUSE YOU FEEL DIMENSION
AND SOME PERSPECTIVE.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.308
- OVERALL, IT'S A REALLY FIERCE
AND FEROCIOUS ANIMAL.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.934
GOOD JOB, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
- FACE-OFF BETWEEN CLEEN
AND JOSH.

27:28.396 --> 27:29.564
LET'S POLL THE JUDGES,

27:29.647 --> 27:31.649
SEE WHO WON
THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.152
- I'M GOING WITH CLEEN.
- CLEEN.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.529
- I WILL ALSO HAVE
TO GO WITH CLEEN.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.198
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.366
- JULIA.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.951
YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH MARK.

27:42.035 --> 27:42.786
{\an8}- IT'S A NICE TATTOO,

27:42.869 --> 27:45.580
{\an8}BUT THAT TRUNK
COULD BE SO DYNAMIC.

27:45.663 --> 27:46.915
{\an8}YOU LEFT IT SIMPLE.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.417
{\an8}IT'S NOT SUPER STRONG
IN A DIMENSIONAL CHALLENGE.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.003
- THE BIG PLACE THAT YOU LACKED
DIMENSION WAS JUST THE FACT

27:52.087 --> 27:53.546
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY AREAS
OF SOFT, SMOOTH GRAY.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.382
YOU DON'T GIVE IT
THAT REALISTIC LOOK

27:55.465 --> 27:57.884
BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY DARK.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.344
- I KNOW HOW MY GRAY WASHES,

27:59.427 --> 28:01.262
AND I KNOW
HOW IT'S GOING TO LIGHTEN UP.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.055
- NO, YOU DON'T.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.765
GET OUT OF HERE!
- YES, I DO!

28:03.848 --> 28:04.891
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- HOW LONG

28:04.974 --> 28:06.267
HAVE YOU BEEN TATTOOING?
- FIVE YEARS.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.435
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOUR HEALED TATTOO'S

28:07.519 --> 28:10.021
GONNA LOOK LIKE
IN 10 OR 12 YEARS?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.815
- I KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HEAL.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.524
- OKAY.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.859
- YOU ALL SET?
- I'M ALL SET.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.488
- MARK.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.116
I DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT THIS
THING WAS WRAPPED UP IN BACON.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.159
IT DIDN'T READ AS ELEPHANT SKIN.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.452
- I THINK I JUST REALLY

28:24.536 --> 28:26.454
TRIED TO GO BALLS TO THE WALL
FOR TEXTURE ON THAT.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.832
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MAYBE
OVERDID YOUR TEXTURE OR--

28:28.915 --> 28:30.458
THINGS ARE GETTING LOST THERE,

28:30.542 --> 28:33.461
AND IT JUST SEEMS
TO BE LACKING IN DIMENSION.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.004
- YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE GUYS
THAT'S IN HERE

28:35.088 --> 28:36.172
RIGHT NOW THAT'S FIGHTING.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.465
EVERY CHOICE
YOU MAKE AT THIS POINT

28:37.549 --> 28:39.175
IS A CHOICE
FOR YOU TO STAY OR TO GO,

28:39.259 --> 28:40.760
AND YOU GOT
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.805
- LET'S POLL THE JUDGES.
MARK VERSUS JULIA.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.641
{\an8}- I'M NOT A SUPER HUGE FAN
OF EITHER OF THESE TATTOOS.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.309
{\an8}- I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH BOTH, TOO,

28:48.393 --> 28:50.603
{\an8}AND CERTAINLY
IN THE DIMENSIONAL CHALLENGE.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.021
{\an8}- EVERYTHING IS A DEAD HEAT.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.481
{\an8}I THINK OVER TIME,

28:53.565 --> 28:58.069
{\an8}JULIA'S WILL WEAR BETTER BECAUSE
AS MARK'S TEXTURES CROSS,

28:58.153 --> 28:58.445
{\an8}IT'S GONNA GET DARKER.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.155
- AGREED.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.489
- FINAL ANSWER?
- JULIA.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.615
- JULIA.
- JULIA.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.742
- CONGRATULATIONS, JULIA.
- THANK YOU.

29:12.709 --> 29:17.380
- ANGEL.
YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH RYAN.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.507
- IT DOES SHOW DIMENSION
IN THIS NICE TURN OF THE ANIMAL.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.801
IT'S REALLY MAJESTIC AND STRONG.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.512
- THIS STRONG BLACK
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD

29:24.596 --> 29:27.432
WITH THE SILHOUETTE OF THE MANE
WAS A REALLY NICE TOUCH.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.934
IF YOU HAVE A NICE SMOOTH BLACK
FADE BEHIND THAT ONTO THE NECK

29:30.018 --> 29:31.019
TO CREATE THAT MUSCLE, WELL,

29:31.102 --> 29:32.896
THIS IS DEFINITELY
A BETTER TATTOO FOR YOU.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.939
- THANK YOU.
- RYAN.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.361
- DIFFICULT TO BE POSITIVE
ON THIS ONE.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.696
IT JUST SITS REALLY FLAT.

29:41.779 --> 29:44.699
THERE WAS NOT VERY GOOD
COLOR SATURATION.

29:44.782 --> 29:46.326
THE LINE WORK IS WONKY.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.495
THE POOR HORSE'S FACE--
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

29:48.578 --> 29:49.579
- DID THE BEST I COULD, MAN.

29:49.662 --> 29:50.830
- IF THIS IS THE BEST YOU GOT,

29:50.914 --> 29:53.625
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.877
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S POLL THE JUDGES,

29:55.960 --> 29:58.213
SEE WHO WON
THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.380
- I WOULD SAY ANGEL.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.174
- ANGEL.
- ANGEL.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.091
- ANGEL, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.676
- THANK YOU.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.345
- CRIS.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.389
YOU HANDED OUT THE SKULLS.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.600
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO GO
HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST AARON?

30:10.683 --> 30:11.809
- HE BEAT ME THE LAST TIME.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.144
JUST WANTED TO REDEEM MYSELF.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.480
- YOU DID SHOW
SOME NICE DIMENSION.

30:15.563 --> 30:17.190
THERE'S SO MUCH DETAIL
IN THAT FACE AND IN THE MOUTH

30:17.273 --> 30:19.275
AND IN THE EYES.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.818
- I THINK IT WAS
A BETTER ATTEMPT

30:20.902 --> 30:22.779
THAN ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN
FROM YOU AT THIS POINT,

30:22.862 --> 30:23.154
SO KEEP THE MOMENTUM.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.948
- AARON.

30:27.825 --> 30:28.743
{\an8}THIS NIPPLE IS JUST KILLING US.

30:28.826 --> 30:31.204
{\an8}- IT WAS THE FLATTEST PLANE
OF CANVAS,

30:31.287 --> 30:32.830
{\an8}AND THE NIPPLE
JUST LAID HOW IT LAID.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.290
{\an8}- YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO

30:34.374 --> 30:36.209
{\an8}WHEN YOU GOT TO THE NIPPLE?
- I JUST WORKED AROUND IT.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.877
{\an8}- THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
YOU COULD'VE DONE.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.088
{\an8}THERE'S GRASSES AND THINGS
YOU COULD'VE PUT UP IN FRONT,

30:40.171 --> 30:42.298
{\an8}SOMETHING TO CAMOUFLAGE
THAT NIPPLE IN,

30:42.382 --> 30:43.633
{\an8}BUT NOW IT'S AN EYESORE.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.926
- IT LOOKS LIKE
THE LION'S BLOWING WIND

30:45.009 --> 30:46.553
ON THE GUY'S NIPPLE.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.929
HE'S GOT ONE SIDE OF THE LIP
THAT DOESN'T MATCH THE OTHER,

30:48.012 --> 30:50.765
SO IT'S A LITTLE UP,
AND HE'S, LIKE, WHISTLING.

30:50.848 --> 30:54.102
IT'S A TOUGH ONE, MAN.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.437
- BETWEEN CRIS AND AARON,
WHO DO YOU CHOOSE?

30:56.521 --> 30:59.232
- I CHOOSE CRIS.

30:59.315 --> 31:00.275
- CRIS.
- I CHOOSE CRIS AS WELL.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.235
WELL DONE, MAN.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.114
ERIK.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.157
YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JASON.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.618
- I SEE SOME AREAS
THAT AREN'T COMPLETE.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.744
DROPPED SHADOWS
AROUND THE LEAVES.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.455
SOME OF THE WHITE
ON THIS CHARACTER

31:14.539 --> 31:16.666
SEEMS TO BE INCONSISTENT.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.293
HAVING SOME TROUBLE
AROUND THE CHIN.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.544
- IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE DONE.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.296
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED TO GO
BACK IN THERE WITH A LINER,

31:21.379 --> 31:24.424
AND YOU CAN FINISH.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.800
- JASON.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.969
- THIS IS
A REALLY DYNAMIC TATTOO.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.304
I DO SEE DIMENSION HERE.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.015
I LIKE THE WHITE HIGHLIGHTS
THAT YOU USED TO CREATE FUR.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.642
IT FEELS FIERCE,
SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.768
- AND THE WAY
THAT YOU GOT THE HAIR

31:35.852 --> 31:38.062
TO REALLY LOOK LIKE THAT
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CHIN.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.523
IT'S A GREAT JOB.
YOU'RE DOING THOSE LITTLE THINGS

31:40.607 --> 31:43.276
THAT SEPARATES YOU
FROM THE PACK.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.904
{\an8}- BOTH GREAT TIGERS, BUT JASON'S
IS CLEANER AND TIGHTER.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.948
{\an8}ERIK,
YOURS JUST LOOKS INCOMPLETE,

31:49.032 --> 31:51.284
{\an8}SO I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO JASON.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.161
- I'M GONNA GO WITH JASON.
- JASON.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.495
- JASON, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.039
- YES.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.707
- DON.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.834
YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH ROBBIE.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.712
YOU DID HIT SOME DIMENSIONAL
ASPECTS OF THIS THING.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.255
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING
AT YOU,

32:04.339 --> 32:05.923
BUT YOU ARE KIND OF COMING
IN TO THIS GUY'S STERNUM.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.801
- I FOCUSED MORE ON
THE COLLARBONE--DIDN'T REALLY

32:08.885 --> 32:10.970
PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION
TO WHERE THAT EAR WAS GOING.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.764
- YOU DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION
TO WHERE THE EAR WAS GOING?

32:12.847 --> 32:16.517
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE MAKING
TATTOOS TO LAST A LIFETIME

32:16.601 --> 32:18.353
AND NOT BE SURE
WHERE THINGS ARE GOING?

32:18.436 --> 32:19.312
IT'S CRAZY.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.564
- ROBBIE.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.483
- THE BACKGROUND SPINS US OUT
A LITTLE BIT,

32:23.566 --> 32:25.068
AND TAKING OUR EYE
AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF DIMENSION.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.862
- LOOKING AT THE DETAIL
YOU GOT IN THE FUR,

32:27.945 --> 32:29.072
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO SEE YOU

32:29.155 --> 32:30.865
DO A MUCH BIGGER, TOUGHER TAKE
ON THIS THING.

32:30.948 --> 32:34.619
THIS IS LITERALLY
50/50 FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND.

32:34.702 --> 32:39.248
SO YOUR WOLF JUST COMES OFF WEAK
IN THE WHOLE TATTOO.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.460
- BOTTOM LINE IS
THAT BOTH OF THE SHAPES

32:42.543 --> 32:43.586
OF THESE THINGS ARE BAD.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.673
{\an8}DON, YOURS HAS A MUCH TOUGHER,
MORE AGGRESSIVE POSE.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.007
{\an8}THE SNOUT'S MOVING FORWARD,

32:48.091 --> 32:50.718
{\an8}SO YOU CREATED
WHAT THE CHALLENGE ASKED FOR.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.679
FOR THAT, I HAVE TO GO WITH DON.

32:52.762 --> 32:53.596
- I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO DON.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.224
- I'M GONNA GO WITH DON TOO.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.726
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.854
- TY'ESHA.
YOU WENT UP AGAINST EMILY.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.189
HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

33:03.272 --> 33:05.066
- SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO STOP RUNNING HER MOUTH.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.901
- WELL, THIS TIME YOU GUYS
WERE ABLE TO HAVE A HEAD-TO-HEAD

33:06.984 --> 33:08.861
COMPETITION
AND MAYBE SQUASH THAT.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.824
- I'M REALLY INTO THE WAY THAT
YOU WERE ABLE TO GET DIMENSION

33:12.907 --> 33:15.493
WITH THIS SHADING
ON THE SIDE OF ITS FACE.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.744
THE LIGHT SMOOTH
BLENDS AND FADES

33:16.828 --> 33:18.079
THAT WE SEE ON THIS TATTOO

33:18.162 --> 33:21.165
SEPARATES YOU FROM A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN HERE TODAY.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.917
THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR YOU.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.421
- EMILY.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.214
- IT JUST REALLY
LOOKS UNFINISHED.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.217
- THIS IS LIGHT BEAMS
SHOOTING THROUGH A JUNGLE.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.093
IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.678
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
ANYTHING IN THIS

33:33.761 --> 33:36.889
TO LOOK AT ON A TECHNICAL LEVEL.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.099
EVERYTHING
IS PAINTERLY AND SKETCHY,

33:38.182 --> 33:40.268
AND THIS DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE YOU WANT TO BE AROUND.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.228
- THIS IS NOT THE LAST OF ME,
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

33:42.311 --> 33:46.232
- THIS TATTOOING IS SOME OF
THE WORST IN THE BUILDING TODAY.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.608
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.278
YOU'D HAVE TO DRAG ME OUT OF
HERE WITH A PACK OF WILD HORSES.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.696
- IF YOU DO END UP STAYING,

33:51.779 --> 33:54.115
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO DO BETTER THAN THIS.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.828
- GORILLA AGAINST A GORILLA.
- TY'ESHA.

33:58.911 --> 34:00.788
- I'M GONNA GO WITH TY'ESHA.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.540
- TY'ESHA.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.584
- WELL DONE.
- THANK YOU.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.211
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

34:07.295 --> 34:09.547
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.632
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.177
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.138
[dramatic music]

34:17.221 --> 34:22.143
- I NEVER HAD A TONGUE LASHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.226
- YOU GOT BLASTED.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.605
- THEY ANNIHILATED ME.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.690
MAN, I'M NOT [bleep]
READY TO GO!

34:28.775 --> 34:31.485
I WORKED SO [bleep] HARD
FOR THIS [bleep].

34:31.569 --> 34:34.655
I'M NOT [bleep] READY FOR IT.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.989
- EMILY COULD DISH IT,
BUT SHE CAN'T TAKE IT.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.284
{\an8}SHE'S WALKING AROUND LIKE A DOG
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.329
SHE'S SO DEFEATED RIGHT NOW.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.873
- I'VE WASTED SO MUCH
ENERGY [bleep] WITH OTHER PEOPLE

34:43.956 --> 34:46.333
AND TRYING
TO GET IN PEOPLE'S HEADS

34:46.417 --> 34:47.960
AND TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME,

34:48.043 --> 34:49.337
WHEN I COULD'VE BEEN
FOCUSING ON MY WORK.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.590
- IF YOU GO DOWN THERE,
DEFINITELY CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE

34:52.672 --> 34:55.301
TO THOSE JUDGES, 'CAUSE IF THEY
SEE YOU BEING, LIKE, COCKY,

34:55.384 --> 34:57.637
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THE BOOT.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.180
- AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO [bleep]

34:59.263 --> 35:01.182
JUST SMEAR YOUR ASS
ALL OVER THE WALL RIGHT NOW,

35:01.265 --> 35:06.521
I'M JUST GONNA SAY
THAT YOUR TATTOO WAS A JOKE.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.897
- I STILL WON.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.857
AND I BEAT YOU TOO.
- YES, WE HEARD.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.442
WE HEARD THE JUDGES.
- AND TY'ESHA BEAT YOU TOO.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.611
BOTH GIRLS HAVE BEATEN YOU NOW.
- BITCH, I'M NOT DEAF!

35:13.694 --> 35:15.822
- YOU'RE STILL BEING KIND
OF A BITCH.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.031
- I UNDER--
I UNDERSTAND WHO WON.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.449
I'M NOT BEING A BITCH.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.327
I'M BEING INTENSE
BECAUSE I'M UPSET.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.673
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING DIMENSION
WITH ANIMAL TATTOOS.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.049
{\an8}AARON DID THE LION.

35:35.132 --> 35:36.801
{\an8}WEIRDLY PLACED TATTOO.

35:36.884 --> 35:40.888
{\an8}- TO CHOOSE TO HIGHLIGHT
THAT NIPPLE IS JUST UNNECESSARY.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.765
- EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS TATTOO BOTHERS ME.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.560
THE PLACEMENT, THE SHAPE,
THE LIPS ARE OFF,

35:45.643 --> 35:46.769
SO IT'S BLOWING KISSES
AT THE NIPPLE.

35:46.853 --> 35:50.731
THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE
OF MY MOST HATED TATTOOS TODAY.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.067
- NEXT UP, WE HAVE RYAN.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.652
- THE DIMENSION IN THIS TATTOO

35:54.735 --> 35:57.446
IS NON-EXISTENT FROM THE
FOREGROUND TO THE BACKGROUND.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.658
THE SHAPE OF THE NECK
TO THE BACK OF THE SHOULDERS,

36:00.741 --> 36:02.285
HOW WIDE THAT IS,
BUT HOW SHORT THE NECK IS--

36:02.368 --> 36:05.538
RYAN DROPPED THE BALL
ON THIS TATTOO IN EVERY WAY.

36:05.621 --> 36:10.042
- MARK LONGENECKER, THIS IS
DEFINITELY IN THE BOTTOM FOR ME.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.753
- THE SKIN TONES,
THE FLAT EARTH TONES.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.256
THIS REALLY LOOKS LIKE
BARK ON A TREE.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.091
- IT WAS ROUGH.

36:17.174 --> 36:18.342
- EMILY.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.468
- IT LOOKS TO ME

36:19.552 --> 36:21.095
LIKE SHE PUT
ALL HER ENERGY IN THAT MOUTH,

36:21.178 --> 36:25.016
AND THEN JUST CHUCKED
THAT BACKGROUND IN THERE.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.767
- IT'S GONNA
BE INTERESTING TO SEE

36:26.851 --> 36:28.436
HOW THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTED.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.520
- I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT.

36:29.604 --> 36:29.896
- SO ARE WE DECIDED?

36:29.979 --> 36:31.439
- YEAH.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.651
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.736
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.280
MARK WAS MY ARTIST.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.407
I'M SO HAPPY WITH IT.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.618
- IT REMINDS ME OF,
LIKE, AN OLD PERSON KIND OF.

36:43.701 --> 36:44.619
IT'S JUST REALLY WRINKLY.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.828
- THE WRINKLES
ARE TOO MATCHY.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.413
- IT LOOKS WOODEN.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.623
IT'S LIKE MAPLE WOOD.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.666
- IT LOOKS MORE LIKE AN ELEPHANT
STATUE THAN AN ELEPHANT.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.628
- YEAH.
- I DON'T SEE DIMENSION

36:53.711 --> 36:54.587
IN THIS TATTOO AT ALL.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.381
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST IS RYAN.

36:57.465 --> 37:01.260
I DON'T THINK RYAN
MADE THE WORST TATTOO TODAY.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.970
- IT'S NOT ANATOMICALLY CORRECT.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.931
THE MUSCLES AREN'T RIGHT.
THE FACE ISN'T RIGHT.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.350
- THE THING IS SO UGLY THAT I
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT SHOWS.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.393
IT'S JUST UGLY.
IT'S JUST A BAD TATTOO.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.478
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS EMILY.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.397
- THE BOTTOM TEETH,
THE FANG ON THE LEFT SIDE--

37:13.481 --> 37:15.983
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A TOOTH
AT ALL TO ME.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.151
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A BALL THERE.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.987
- THE TONGUE LOOKS A LITTLE
LIKE SILLY PUTTY.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.573
- YEAH, LIKE SHE MISSED THE END
OF HIS JAW LINE.

37:22.657 --> 37:23.240
- WE HAVE A DECISION?
- YUP.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.700
all: YES.
- YES, WE DO.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.868
- YEAH.

37:26.994 --> 37:27.995
- I'M NOT VERY CALM RIGHT NOW.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.331
- I KNOW THE JUDGES HATED MINE.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.375
- YEAH, YOU KIND
OF GOT A BAD TRACK RECORD TOO.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.585
- I CAN DO THE MATH, BRO.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.837
- DAMN.

37:36.921 --> 37:42.176
- THE JUDGES WANT TO SEE...

37:42.259 --> 37:43.719
MARK,

37:43.803 --> 37:45.846
RYAN,

37:45.930 --> 37:47.765
AND EMILY.

37:47.848 --> 37:52.019
WE'LL SEE YOU
AND YOUR RIVAL DOWNSTAIRS.

37:53.562 --> 37:55.523
- I AIN'T [bleep] DONE YET.

37:55.606 --> 37:56.816
- Y'ALL AIN'T SEEN
THE [bleep] LAST OF ME.

37:56.899 --> 37:59.527
- LET'S GO.

38:09.954 --> 38:13.249
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO USE
DIMENSION TO MAKE ANIMAL TATTOOS

38:13.332 --> 38:14.875
THAT LEAP OFF THE SKIN.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.336
RYAN, EMILY, MARK,

38:17.420 --> 38:22.800
ANY ONE OF YOU
CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE ELIMINATED.

38:22.883 --> 38:23.801
RYAN.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.302
YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:25.386 --> 38:29.724
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.852
- THIS REALLY WENT BAD.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.562
IT JUST...DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE,

38:34.645 --> 38:35.479
AND THEN THE COLOR PALETTE
YOU CHOSE

38:35.563 --> 38:39.191
AND THIS LADY'S COMPLEXION
IS WAY OFF.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.027
- I NEED TO STOP
THINKING COMPETITION

38:41.110 --> 38:42.903
AND START WALKING IN
LIKE I'M JUST AT MY SHOP.

38:42.987 --> 38:43.821
I DO BETTER THAN THIS.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.698
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW I DO BETTER THAN THIS.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.616
IT'S JUST, I NEED TO PULL
MY HEAD OUT OF MY ASS.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.577
- MARK.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.953
- IF YOU COULD REDO THIS TATTOO

38:51.037 --> 38:52.079
AND JUST DO IT LIGHTER,

38:52.163 --> 38:55.166
EASE UP ON SO MUCH CRAZINESS
THAT YOU PUT INTO IT,

38:55.249 --> 38:56.667
YOU WOULDN'T BE DOWN HERE.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.586
- I STILL DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.171
I'M HERE TO COMPETE.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.255
I WANT TO GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

39:01.338 --> 39:02.548
I WANT TO KICK SOME ASS.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.842
TO LEAVE NOW WITHOUT EVER
SHOWING SOMETHING AMAZING

39:04.925 --> 39:05.926
WOULD CRUSH ME.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.346
- YOU'RE DOWN HERE A LOT,

39:08.429 --> 39:09.764
AND IT'S GETTING
HARDER AND HARDER

39:09.847 --> 39:12.224
TO JUSTIFY YOU
IN THIS COMPETITION.

39:15.269 --> 39:16.604
- EMILY.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.147
- YOU STARTED OFF HOT

39:18.230 --> 39:20.107
AS YOU WORKED IN THE MOUTH
OF THIS GORILLA,

39:20.191 --> 39:21.942
AND THEN IT LOST STEAM.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.945
- THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR ME TO BE
PUTTING OUT WORK LIKE THAT

39:25.029 --> 39:26.989
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT I'VE LET THIS COMPETITION

39:27.073 --> 39:28.115
GET UP IN MY HEAD.

39:28.199 --> 39:31.660
I'M HERE TO COMPETE,
AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS

39:31.744 --> 39:33.788
AND I WANT
TO SHOW THE [bleep] WORLD

39:33.871 --> 39:35.122
THAT I AM COMPLETELY CAPABLE
OF THIS.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.458
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN US,

39:37.541 --> 39:39.418
AND IF YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY,
PROVE IT.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.964

THE LACK OF DIMENSION,

39:58.187 --> 40:00.231

40:09.698 --> 40:12.785
I STILL DESERVE TO BE UP
IN THAT HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

40:12.868 --> 40:15.162
I GOT SCREWED AND BLINDSIDED,
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.831
I'M GONNA GO HOME,
AND I'M GONNA WORK

I'M A BUTT MASTER.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.137

I CAN'T TATTOO TODAY AT ALL.

IS JUST NOT THERE.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.193
IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.779

I WANT THAN TO SEND HER HOME.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.616
