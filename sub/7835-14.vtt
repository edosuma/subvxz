01:25.753 --> 01:27.420
Bill, bill...

01:28.672 --> 01:33.760
Bill. Homer, you got a letter.
Hmm. It's from the library.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.183
Overdue book? This is the
biggest frame-up since O.J.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.437
Wait a minute. Blood in the
Bronco, the cuts on his hands,

01:44.521 --> 01:48.191
those Jay Leno monologues!
Oh, my God! He did it!

01:50.194 --> 01:51.235
Here's the book.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.030
"Classics for Children"?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.949
Yeah. I checked that
out when Bart was born.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.786
I was gonna read to him every day.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.912
What happened?

02:00.996 --> 02:04.499
Stuff kept coming up. Mostly
car-related. Piece of crap.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.125
Why don't you read to us now?

02:06.210 --> 02:08.419
I decide who reads and when!

02:10.714 --> 02:13.007
How about now? Mmm.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.677
Homer's Odyssey. Is this about
that minivan I rented once?

02:16.762 --> 02:19.639
No, Dad. It's an epic
tale from ancient Greece.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.725
That minivan had the
biggest cup holders.

02:23.018 --> 02:27.313
And change slots for every
coin, from penny to quarter.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.817
Dad, I loved it, too, but
it was seven years ago.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.193
Fine.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.154
"It was the end of the Trojan War.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.990
"Clever Odysseus had come up with a plan

02:38.075 --> 02:40.785
"to destroy the Trojans
once and for all. "

02:46.667 --> 02:48.501
Hi, odiddily-Odysseus!

02:48.585 --> 02:49.919
Stupid king of Troy.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.588
I think I speak for all
the Greeks when I say

02:52.673 --> 02:55.258
this war has gone on for too long.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.095
I'll say. I'd really like
to go out and get the mail.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.058
Anyway, over torture, one
of your soldiers mentioned

03:04.142 --> 03:06.227
that you collect giant wooden animals.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.437
We hope you don't have a horse.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.983
Well, I don't have one from you.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.150
Bring it in!

03:20.325 --> 03:23.119
Now throughout history,
when people get wood,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.912
they'll think of Trojans.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.623
Trojans.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.292
What are you laughing at, Dad?

03:29.376 --> 03:32.795
If I'm laughing at what I
think I am, it's very funny.

03:33.797 --> 03:38.217
Anyway, "As night fell, the Greek
soldiers crept from the wooden horse. "

03:46.643 --> 03:49.478
Aw, look at them. Sleeping
like little angels.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.898
Spare no one.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.531
Remember, just 'cause their heads
are off, it don't mean they're dead.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.040
Now I can return to Ithaca
and my sweet wife, Penelope.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.627
Odysseus, do not forget to
thank the gods for our victory

04:12.711 --> 04:14.795
with an appropriate animal sacrifice.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.255
Forget it!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.466
Sacrificing animals is barbaric.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.801
Now have the slaves kill the wounded.

04:26.516 --> 04:30.561
No sacrifice? We'll teach that
mortal to trifle with the gods.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.896
I got it.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.735
You fat lush. You just
destroyed Atlantis.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.195
You used to be fun.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.114
Where's the Zeus who
used to turn into a cow

04:42.199 --> 04:43.783
and pick up chicks?

04:43.867 --> 04:46.202
He grew up. Maybe you should, too.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.704
Poseidon, you take care of Odysseus.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.583
Yarr. I'll send him far. Off course.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.090
"Greece" is the word.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.260
Is it "vase" or "vase"?

05:03.595 --> 05:05.304
You gonna be asking that the whole trip?

05:05.389 --> 05:07.848
Gentlemen, I must be wasted,

05:07.933 --> 05:10.476
'cause it looks like
that cloud is mad at me.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.688
Yarr!

05:15.107 --> 05:16.107
Yarr!

05:27.202 --> 05:30.746
On the island Island of Sirens

05:31.581 --> 05:34.834
Our hot sex Will leave you perspiring

05:34.918 --> 05:36.669
Hey, that's kind of catchy.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.297
It's coming from that island.
Let's steer heedlessly towards it.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.882
Heedlessly it is.

05:46.972 --> 05:51.100
The feta is cheesy The Sirens are easy

05:51.601 --> 05:55.646
Boy, if they kiss as
good as they lure, wow!

05:56.106 --> 05:59.275
On the island

05:59.985 --> 06:03.029
We'll sex you up

06:03.822 --> 06:06.198
Island of Sirens

06:06.283 --> 06:07.908
Oh, God! They're hideous!

06:10.203 --> 06:12.079
Someone gouge my eyes!

06:12.205 --> 06:14.081
Save me from the ladies!

06:20.797 --> 06:24.091
It's been so many years
since I've seen your father.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.469
I hope he's still the magnificent

06:26.553 --> 06:28.804
physical specimen he was when he left.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.016
Mom, maybe it's time to choose a suitor.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.483
Discus Stu has ouzo for twozo.

06:40.817 --> 06:41.984
I'll leave you guys alone.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.071
Discus Stu was talking to you.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.824
Oh, where could your father be?

06:49.201 --> 06:50.826
Almost home.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.501
Ain't I a stinker?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.757
Welcome to my island. I
am Circe, the sorceress.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.676
Boy, who decided to give
every weirdo an island?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.679
You must be thirsty.
Drink from my cauldron.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.851
Well, I was in the mood
for something bubbling.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.770
Out of the way, slim.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.114
Thanks for your help with
the anchor, guys. Guys?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.034
That pig looks like Lenny.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.161
Hey!

07:34.246 --> 07:37.790
Mmm. That's the next best
thing to eating Lenny.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.919
I'm still hungry.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.754
Didn't you eat enough of your friends?

07:44.089 --> 07:46.090
Those were my friends?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.676
Yes. I've been saying that for hours.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.054
That's it! I'm going
home! Which way to Ithaca?

07:52.264 --> 07:53.889
It's not so easy.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.976
You must go through Hades,
crossing the River Styx.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.355
You're my lady

08:01.439 --> 08:04.692
Of the morning

08:05.569 --> 08:08.237
Oh, this truly is hell!

08:10.115 --> 08:15.327
Okay. It has been 20 years, and
you suitors have been very patient.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.746
We've been beyond patient!

08:17.831 --> 08:20.332
When we came here,
Helen of Troy was hot!

08:20.417 --> 08:21.584
Now look at her!

08:21.668 --> 08:24.587
This is the face that
launched a thousand ships,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.172
the other way.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.716
Honey, I'm home.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.094
Well, look who the fates dragged in.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.429
Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long,

08:34.681 --> 08:38.017
but I'm gonna do something
I haven't done for 20 years.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.934
Take out the trash!

08:45.108 --> 08:48.986
Sweet Penelope, you're just as
beautiful as you were when I left.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.488
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.867
Aw.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.038
Brave Odysseus, it's been 20 long years.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.373
Regale me with tales of your adventures.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.834
Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.257
Oh, here's the story of Joan of Arc.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.593
Ooh! Did you say Joan Van Ark?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.386
No, Mom. Joan of Arc.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.056
It's never Joan Van Ark.

09:17.641 --> 09:22.102
This one takes place in a
make-believe kingdom called France.

09:23.063 --> 09:27.024
"The French were fighting the
English in the Hundred Years' War,

09:27.108 --> 09:30.527
"which was then called
Operation Speedy Resolution. "

09:33.114 --> 09:35.991
Son, how's it going with
the breakfast pÃ¢tÃ©?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.409
I'm on it.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.541
Bartrand, where is your sister Joan?

09:44.626 --> 09:48.003
Morning bells are ringing.
Morning bells are ringing.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.340
She's talking to her
invisible friend. God.

09:51.883 --> 09:56.845
And please bless Mama and Papa
and Bartrand and Coco Chanel.

10:01.184 --> 10:05.354
Joan of Arc, I am your God.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.775
I have chosen you to lead
the French army to victory

10:09.859 --> 10:11.819
over the English invaders.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.904
But I'm just a little girl.

10:13.989 --> 10:18.284
I know. I have three
eyes. Now get cracking.

10:20.328 --> 10:24.039
God wants you to lead
the French army to what?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.541
Victory.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.709
Victory?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.129
We're French! We don't
even have a word for it!

10:30.380 --> 10:33.549
God spoke to me. I must obey.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.635
Joan, give me your dessert.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.178
That's just you, Bart.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.307
Joan, give me your dessert!

10:41.391 --> 10:42.558
Yes, sir.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.982
That's going straight to my five thighs.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.570
All right, garÃ§ons.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.073
Huh?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.701
No, un. You know, French for "one. "

11:00.785 --> 11:03.370
Well, you keep switching back
between French and English.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.456
Just fire the damn thing.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.553
My fault this time. I
didn't tuck in my legs.

11:20.221 --> 11:24.183
Wait! I have been sent to lead
the French army to victory!

11:25.769 --> 11:28.354
Yeah, really? And how
are you gonna do that?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.772
With modern ideas,

11:29.856 --> 11:33.108
like putting bigger, harder
people in the catapult.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.319
Or, how about rocks?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.238
Rock.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.075
I don't know how to feel just now.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.452
And now, attack!

11:48.750 --> 11:49.792
Shouldn't we help her?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.377
Yeah, right behind you, Lou.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.008
Uh-oh. There's my supervisor.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.891
Hello, hello, hello.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.978
What's all this then? It's a
little bird with a knife, isn't it?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.649
What a thing to happen!

12:18.196 --> 12:19.196
Blimey!

12:22.951 --> 12:25.285
We welcome our savior, Joan of Arc.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.664
It is customary to
kneel before the king.

12:28.832 --> 12:32.709
I would gladly kneel,
were you the real king.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.214
You are the true dauphin.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.383
You had this impostor try to fool me

12:39.467 --> 12:41.969
to see if I was truly sent by God.

12:43.805 --> 12:48.851
Bravo, Joan of Arc. You are as
brainsome as you are toothsome.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.232
Quimbe, you may resume
your regular duties now.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.526
It would be my pleasure.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.736
Vibrate for me, footstool.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.744
Loyal subjects, let us
drink to Joan of Arc,

13:07.829 --> 13:12.291
who will conquer the English, and
has already conquered my heart.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.044
Uh, God says we should just be friends.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.047
I wouldn't say King Milhouse is a loser,

13:19.215 --> 13:22.134
but that's the 12th girl he's
struck out with this week!

13:22.218 --> 13:24.136
Boil him in oil!

13:24.554 --> 13:26.263
So no 10:30 show?

13:34.564 --> 13:35.981
Let us kill the English!

13:36.065 --> 13:39.359
Their concept of individual
rights could undermine the power

13:39.444 --> 13:41.320
of our beloved tyrants!

13:44.073 --> 13:45.324
They're attacking again.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.201
I thought we had a truce.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.537
Just because you keep
saying it doesn't make it so.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.164
Oh, my word!

13:56.753 --> 14:01.423
You can't stop me! I was sent by God!

14:02.926 --> 14:04.301
I want my mommy!

14:04.385 --> 14:07.513
I captured a wee girl!

14:08.056 --> 14:10.682
I'm the greatest hero
in English history!

14:12.268 --> 14:16.396
Joan of Arc, you are accused
of heresy, witchcraft,

14:16.898 --> 14:19.441
and that man told me you pushed him.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.530
I would like to call my
only witness. Almighty God.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.754
I told this maiden to
lead the French to victory.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.674
Wait a minute, you
two-timing spot of light.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.052
You told me to lead
the English to victory!

14:47.345 --> 14:49.680
Is that true, Lord?

14:49.764 --> 14:52.808
Well, I never thought the two of you

14:52.892 --> 14:55.060
would be in the same room, actually.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.897
This is a little
embarrassing. Goodbye now.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.067
That was weird.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.235
Let's burn her!

15:03.319 --> 15:05.153
Yeah! Burn her! Burn her!

15:08.866 --> 15:12.619
Don't burn her! She's
just an innocent child!

15:12.829 --> 15:15.581
Burn this guy! He lost a good bucket!

15:19.711 --> 15:23.255
Joan, renounce your
faith. Save yourself.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.593
Don't worry, beloved parents. God
won't let anything happen to me.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.804
Huh. Getting kind of hot around here.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.556
Wow.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.601
What happened, Dad? They didn't
really burn her, did they?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.853
Of course they didn't, honey.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.605
"Just then, Sir Lancelot rode up

15:39.689 --> 15:41.773
"on a white horse and saved Joan of Arc.

15:41.858 --> 15:45.235
"They got married and lived
in a spaceship. The end. "

15:48.281 --> 15:51.491
Well, that's easier to
chew than that Bambi video.

15:54.829 --> 15:58.624
Our next story is Hamlet,
by William Shakespeare.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.792
Dad, these old stories can't compare

16:00.877 --> 16:02.586
with our modern super writers.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.005
Steven Bochco could
kick Shakespeare's ass!

16:05.089 --> 16:07.549
Look, this story's more
interesting than you think.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.968
It starts with Hamlet's
father getting murdered.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.262
Cool. Does he get to marry his mom?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.640
I don't know, but that would be hot.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.644
"Once upon a time, there was
a young Prince of Denmark. "

16:21.898 --> 16:25.400
Hamlet! Avenge me!

16:25.735 --> 16:26.818
Dad?

16:26.903 --> 16:29.237
Yes. I have returned from the dead.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.948
Looks like you've
returned from the buffet.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.242
Why, you little... D'oh!

16:36.079 --> 16:40.040
My son, I have some shocking
news. I was murdered.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.085
Murdered, I tells you! Really?

16:43.336 --> 16:49.091
Behold! As I slept, your Uncle
Claudius poured poison in my ear.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.593
Poison most foul!

16:52.512 --> 16:56.014
So he could marry your
mother and become the king!

16:56.099 --> 16:57.933
Yeah, that was quite a weekend.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.936
Now you must avenge me. Avenge me!

17:01.062 --> 17:02.562
How? I don't know.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.940
Surprise me.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.358
Surprise me!

17:09.569 --> 17:11.613
Could that fat ghost
be telling the truth?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.241
First, I've gotta get
Uncle Claudius to confess.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.617
Then I've gotta kill him.

17:16.786 --> 17:21.039
It's cold outside. You'll
need a sweater. A sweater!

17:25.962 --> 17:30.465
And if your idea of a first
date is burning down her village,

17:30.842 --> 17:33.385
you just might be a Viking!

17:37.306 --> 17:40.225
That's what I get for
sitting up front, eh?

17:46.941 --> 17:48.984
I love these jesters.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.988
They're exactly what I need to
forget about my first husband.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.990
Yeah, I really miss the old guy.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.242
It was all I could do
to put on his jewels

17:57.326 --> 17:59.870
and score with his wife every night.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.247
How are you doing, kid? Nice to see you.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.208
Now we would like to
warn you, our performances

18:05.293 --> 18:08.295
tend to make audience members
blurt out hidden secrets.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.588
Oh, boy.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.716
Aha! Methinks the play's the thing

18:12.800 --> 18:15.594
wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the king.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.679
Catch my conscience? What?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.390
You're not supposed to
hear me. That's a soliloquy.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.809
Okay, well, I'll do a soliloquy, too.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.022
Note to self. Kill that kid.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.442
Okay, we're gonna open it
up with a little improv.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.110
Somebody shout out a location!

18:32.195 --> 18:33.987
This castle! Okay.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.322
How about an occupation?

18:35.406 --> 18:37.115
Usurper of the throne!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.244
I think I heard
"usurper of the throne. "

18:41.329 --> 18:42.871
Now finally, I need an object.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.372
Ear poison!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.708
Hey, do you have diarrhea?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.376
I have diarrhea.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.544
Sit down!

19:00.515 --> 19:03.099
Wait a minute! I didn't
use that much poison!

19:04.852 --> 19:08.522
I mean, I didn't use that much
poi, son, at the royal luau.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.489
Daddy, it's true! Uncle
Claudius murdered you!

19:17.573 --> 19:20.325
Oh, great. Now Hamlet's acting crazy.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.203
Well nobody out-crazies Ophelia.

19:23.412 --> 19:27.707
Hey, nonny nonny, with a hoo
and a haw, and a nonny nonny hey!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.802
Hamlet, what'd I tell you
about running with swords?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.972
Someone's behind the
curtain. It could be Claudius.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.516
Only one way to find out.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.894
Ow!

19:47.979 --> 19:50.814
Polonius? What are you
doing behind the curtain?

19:50.898 --> 19:54.734
I hide behind curtains 'cause I
have a fear of getting stabbed.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.695
Daddy's stomach is crying.

19:56.779 --> 20:01.449
Laertes, you gotta do a
special big-boy job for Daddy.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.619
I need you to avenge my death.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.621
I like revenging!

20:08.958 --> 20:11.793
I'm gonna kill Hamlet.
Here's my mad face.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.716
Cute kid. But just in
case you don't kill Hamlet,

20:17.800 --> 20:20.552
I put some poison on
the food, on the drapes,

20:20.636 --> 20:23.471
even on Rosencarl and Guildenlenny here.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.224
If Hamlet touches
either of us, he's dead.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.267
Booyah!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.647
Now, Hamlet, you know the rules.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.734
Laertes here gets one practice stab.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.027
Oh, boy!

20:38.529 --> 20:40.780
Boy, did I bet on the wrong horse.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.243
Now there's nothing to stop
me from getting my vengeance.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.912
You sure you don't want
a nice piece of fish,

20:46.996 --> 20:48.914
or to finger the drapes a little?

20:48.998 --> 20:50.874
This ends here!

20:53.419 --> 20:55.670
Remember me as a peacemaker.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.509
And now to celebrate
life! Whoa! Bloody floor!

21:06.182 --> 21:08.558
No way I'm cleaning up this mess.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.147
And that's the greatest
thing ever written.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.398
Are you crazy?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.567
I can't believe a play where
every character is murdered

21:17.652 --> 21:19.194
could be so boring!

21:19.278 --> 21:22.030
Son, it's not only a great play,

21:22.365 --> 21:27.035
but also became a great
movie called Ghostbusters.
