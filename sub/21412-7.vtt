WEBVTT

00:01.615 --> 00:02.710
Let's go! Let's go!

00:02.735 --> 00:04.783
Come on! Where's the van?
This way!

00:10.814 --> 00:12.604
Let's go, go, go, go!

00:15.580 --> 00:17.572
All they'll see
on those security cameras

00:17.665 --> 00:20.759
is a bunch of guys with these
stupid Spider-Man masks on.

00:20.873 --> 00:21.938
- What?
- Huh?

00:21.986 --> 00:23.627
Spider-Man? Don't worry.

00:23.663 --> 00:26.165
That clown barely knows how
to use those powers of his.

00:26.213 --> 00:27.685
Don't be fooled, fellas.

00:27.733 --> 00:29.700
Everything before now
was just a beta-test.

00:29.759 --> 00:32.803
- Those masks are so last week.
- Get him!

00:37.048 --> 00:38.095
Whoa!

00:40.712 --> 00:42.298
Can't see!

00:44.509 --> 00:46.385
And this is our last stop,

00:47.815 --> 00:50.423
Courtesy of the more awesomer
than ever Spider-Man.

00:50.503 --> 00:52.220
And I'm out, guys.

00:55.394 --> 00:57.766
This new costume made
from the V-252 substance

00:57.814 --> 00:59.431
is everything
I've ever dreamed of.

00:59.479 --> 01:02.666
It morphs over my body, so no more
need to carry a change of clothes.

01:02.931 --> 01:04.712
It has unlimited webs.

01:05.141 --> 01:07.689
Oh, thanks, Spider-Man.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.909
Remember, stay in school and
eat your broccoli. Son!

01:11.957 --> 01:12.958
Get over here.

01:14.269 --> 01:15.779
- Sorry, buddy.
- Hey!

01:15.847 --> 01:18.504
But your new accessory
clashes with that outfit.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.617
Here. Write me
a good review online.

01:20.769 --> 01:23.386
But most importantly,
it reacts with me,

01:23.480 --> 01:26.738
making me much stronger
nearly unstoppable.

01:31.293 --> 01:33.042
Oh, what's this?
Three more wins?

01:33.182 --> 01:34.761
Why do I even
bother counting anymore?

01:34.808 --> 01:36.105
Peter?

01:38.308 --> 01:39.502
Come in, Aunt May.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.488
Breakfast is ready...

01:41.879 --> 01:46.035
Oh, my! Peter,
did you get any sleep last night?

01:46.097 --> 01:47.908
You look exhausted.

01:49.738 --> 01:51.832
No time for breakfast.
Horizon calls.

01:51.925 --> 01:52.949
Gotta go.

01:53.115 --> 01:56.129
Huh. I've never seen him
so intense.

01:56.222 --> 01:59.128
That police scanner app
I created works like a charm.

01:59.176 --> 02:02.238
And something tells me I'll
even beat 'em to the scene. Ha!

02:02.441 --> 02:04.722
One AIM agent
breaking into a warehouse?

02:06.925 --> 02:09.657
Sorry, buddy,
but this'll take Spidey 2.0

02:09.711 --> 02:11.696
about 2.0 seconds.

02:12.461 --> 02:14.008
Don't move.

02:14.563 --> 02:17.172
I might have to adjust
my calculation.

02:23.329 --> 02:27.258
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01  Episode 07</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>" Symbolic Relationship"</font>

02:28.390 --> 02:31.062
So a dozen AIM agents
against one spider

02:31.312 --> 02:34.273
Mathematically, I can see where
you think you have the advantage.

02:37.062 --> 02:40.335
But that's only if you forgot to
factor in that I'm the all-new,

02:40.383 --> 02:42.054
all-different Spider-Man.

02:46.617 --> 02:48.999
Ice guns? You guys
even make winter evil.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.515
And, ladies and gentlemen,
that's how you do it.

02:58.906 --> 03:00.164
Selfie time.

03:01.945 --> 03:03.467
I'll text this
to the police.

03:03.515 --> 03:05.986
Smile, guys. What do you think?
New profile pic?

03:07.640 --> 03:09.163
Huh?

03:09.335 --> 03:11.890
Vulture? Huh.
He's supposed to be in prison.

03:11.976 --> 03:13.835
Booyah!
Bring on the baddies!

03:13.883 --> 03:15.577
Sorry to ruin your dreams,
fellas.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.492
Next time,<i> aim</i> higher.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.718
Ha! Even my jokes
are better.

03:22.563 --> 03:24.445
Long time, no see, Vultchy!

03:25.007 --> 03:26.062
Don't remember me?

03:26.110 --> 03:28.399
- It's your old pal, Spidey.
- Get off of me!

03:28.469 --> 03:31.242
This suit is not calibrated
for your extra weight.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.844
Really?
That all you have to say?

03:32.906 --> 03:36.360
You were my first bad guy. You can't
come up with something more sentimental?

03:36.499 --> 03:39.867
Actually, scratch that.
If I remember correctly,

03:39.961 --> 03:42.258
your Sonic Scream
never has anything good to say.

03:44.891 --> 03:49.102
Anyway, I thought you wouldn't mind
giving me a ride to the local prison.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.031
My friend, Adrian Toomes,
is behind bars,

03:51.093 --> 03:53.313
and I thought I'd
pay him a visit.

03:53.686 --> 03:54.976
Wait!

03:55.024 --> 03:57.817
- Isn't your name also Adrian Toomes?
- Huh?

03:58.358 --> 04:02.426
Here you go, boys. Courtesy of the
immeasurably awesome Spider-Man.

04:02.621 --> 04:05.781
That vigilante
just assaulted an innocent man.

04:06.125 --> 04:09.695
When did I do that? I was
busy clipping your wings.

04:10.847 --> 04:13.648
<i>I</i> am the innocent man.

04:14.856 --> 04:16.586
He's right,
dark Spider-Man.

04:16.634 --> 04:17.935
It's, uh...

04:18.007 --> 04:20.297
It's actually still
just "Spider-Man."

04:20.438 --> 04:24.031
Oh. Well, Toomes here
was released this morning.

04:24.242 --> 04:27.258
Who in their right mind
bailed him out of prison?

04:27.422 --> 04:28.641
Norman Osborn.

04:28.719 --> 04:29.923
What?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.617
The head
of Osborn Academy

04:31.665 --> 04:34.029
knows genius
when he sees it,

04:34.117 --> 04:35.860
and therefore
arranged my freedom

04:35.908 --> 04:40.727
in exchange for services
as his newest faculty member.

04:40.977 --> 04:42.944
Do you want to press charges,
Mr. Toomes?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.727
Press charges?

04:44.822 --> 04:46.860
I should,
for the good of society.

04:47.031 --> 04:50.703
But I'm making a new start,
and I'd rather untangle myself

04:50.751 --> 04:53.110
from any spider affairs.

04:53.262 --> 04:55.488
But... But he's
a criminal!

04:56.149 --> 04:58.860
Not if he stays on the
right side of the law.

04:59.017 --> 05:02.477
A bad penny is bad no
matter what side it's on.

05:03.348 --> 05:06.719
Yo! Over here.
'Sup?

05:06.783 --> 05:08.767
Pete?

05:09.673 --> 05:13.675
So Toomes is a professor at Oz Academy now?
What's up with that?

05:13.836 --> 05:15.688
Hey, we're lucky
to have him.

05:15.792 --> 05:19.539
The guy's a genius. Plus now
Oz has his Vulture tech.

05:19.672 --> 05:23.227
I was trying out that Sonic Scream earlier.
Pretty sweet.

05:23.383 --> 05:25.820
Yeah. Pretty sweet
for a criminal.

05:25.918 --> 05:28.172
And I'm not buying
the whole "fresh start" bit.

05:28.313 --> 05:30.930
People don't just
change overnight, H.O.

05:32.203 --> 05:34.219
You seem to have.

05:34.453 --> 05:37.565
What? Just a little
confidence, brah.

05:39.818 --> 05:42.735
If I was like this at Midtown,
I'd have been way more popular.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.039
Didn't realize that
was important to ya.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.735
Gotta bolt.
Working on that Expo pro...

05:47.819 --> 05:50.625
Er, that thing
that cannot be discussed.

05:51.662 --> 05:53.125
Ka-pow!

05:53.677 --> 05:54.843
Booyah!

05:56.031 --> 05:57.785
Text me later.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.133
Hmm?

06:01.117 --> 06:04.258
- Adrian.
- Hello, Norman.

06:04.570 --> 06:06.719
I see you're already busy.

06:06.805 --> 06:09.756
Good. We need to discuss
the Stark Expo.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.360
I'm working on a variety
of options that are...

06:12.434 --> 06:14.359
Not what we're working on.

06:14.758 --> 06:16.971
What Horizon High
is working on.

06:17.594 --> 06:18.985
I see.

06:19.203 --> 06:22.141
So you didn't hire me
just for my skills.

06:22.461 --> 06:24.508
Don't get
your feathers ruffled.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.326
I hired you because
you're supremely qualified.

06:27.552 --> 06:31.721
But if you also happen to know what Horizon
High is presenting at the Stark Expo,

06:31.830 --> 06:33.727
then I am all the luckier.

06:33.867 --> 06:37.281
It will most likely
be the V-252.

06:37.797 --> 06:41.836
V-252? What is that?

06:42.086 --> 06:44.492
Three years ago,
the Space Administration

06:44.540 --> 06:46.077
donated a substance
they discovered

06:46.125 --> 06:48.938
to Horizon High
for further study.

06:49.227 --> 06:51.742
Max Modell
labeled it "V-252."

06:51.827 --> 06:53.680
His hope being
that he could stabilize it

06:53.753 --> 06:57.031
and add it as a new element
to the periodic table.

06:57.336 --> 07:00.695
When I left, they were getting
close to doing just that.

07:00.825 --> 07:04.438
That would be quite an
achievement for Horizon High.

07:04.729 --> 07:07.258
You have no idea.

07:07.586 --> 07:10.625
It's lighter than plastic
but stronger than steel.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.438
If Max Modell could figure out
how to maximize it,

07:13.486 --> 07:15.250
it's a game changer.

07:15.328 --> 07:18.899
Not just for the school...
For the world.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.945
Then we need to get
our hands on it.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.904
You still have
your old access codes?

07:23.031 --> 07:25.149
I'm certain
Modell's changed them.

07:25.584 --> 07:26.883
Then...

07:26.985 --> 07:29.242
perhaps you could enter
by other means.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.327
I just got out
of prison, Norman.

07:31.438 --> 07:34.805
I'm not going to throw it all
away by breaking and entering.

07:34.914 --> 07:37.391
Then let me do it.
I've been dying

07:37.439 --> 07:39.969
to try out your tech
since the first day I saw it.

07:40.195 --> 07:41.953
Well, look at that, Adrian.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.164
Young Alistair's a fan.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.094
Huh.

07:46.281 --> 07:48.961
Well, we could always
take another shot

07:49.024 --> 07:51.110
at the perpetual
motion machine.

07:51.336 --> 07:54.761
I can't believe we're
not presenting the V-252.

07:54.838 --> 07:58.188
This might be the first year
Horizon loses the Stark Expo.

07:58.399 --> 08:01.172
Oz Academy will definitely beat us.

08:03.078 --> 08:04.836
'Sup, gang?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.360
What's with
all the mopey mopes?

08:07.432 --> 08:10.187
You're not still upset about
the missing V-252, are you?

08:10.235 --> 08:12.422
Come on.
We're Horizon High.

08:12.486 --> 08:14.930
I'll come up with seven brilliant
ideas by this afternoon.

08:15.031 --> 08:17.438
It's what I do.
Someday, they'll call Tony Stark

08:17.486 --> 08:19.680
"the poor man's
Peter Parker."

08:19.820 --> 08:21.922
Later, Horizonaters.

08:27.537 --> 08:29.537
It's gotta
be here somewhere.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.442
This isn't it.

08:40.859 --> 08:42.278
Uh-oh.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:51.287 --> 08:53.412
Huh? Who's there?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.514
Security!

08:55.967 --> 08:57.624
Huh? Adrian?

09:02.443 --> 09:05.795
Huh? You read my mind, suit.

09:05.857 --> 09:08.442
Adrian? Why would you...

09:09.396 --> 09:12.693
Aaah! Well, look who it is.
Knew you were still a criminal.

09:12.832 --> 09:15.123
Can't teach an old Vulture new tricks.

09:16.615 --> 09:18.722
Spider-Man? Is that you?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.120
Know anyone else who fights
this awesome?

09:21.425 --> 09:23.979
I'll get Toomes back behind bars.

09:24.831 --> 09:28.175
But first, time to teach the professor
a lesson!

09:28.253 --> 09:30.753
Stop!
I'm calling the police.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.737
Can't you see he's had enough?
You're going overboard!

09:34.339 --> 09:35.769
I am?

09:36.902 --> 09:38.650
No!

09:40.964 --> 09:43.174
You're not getting away from me!

09:45.089 --> 09:47.206
Max!

09:47.917 --> 09:49.846
Max!

09:49.995 --> 09:52.471
Did someone order
a lifesaving superhero?

09:52.682 --> 09:54.486
Buckle up, big guy!

09:55.831 --> 09:58.214
- This is our floor.
- Phew.

09:59.401 --> 10:00.954
I thought I was done for.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.314
Nah. You got nothing
to worry about

10:03.362 --> 10:05.096
as long as
I'm around, M.M.

10:05.177 --> 10:08.456
Spidey?
Has something happened?

10:08.573 --> 10:11.119
You seem... different.

10:11.167 --> 10:14.448
Forgot the sunscreen.
Got a little too much sun.

10:14.987 --> 10:16.594
Ka-pow!

10:16.948 --> 10:19.255
Lates.

10:19.557 --> 10:22.901
I searched the whole place.
The V-252 wasn't there.

10:23.010 --> 10:25.189
But worse... I was seen.

10:25.237 --> 10:27.456
<i>Get back here now, Alistair.</i>

10:28.776 --> 10:32.714
Making a beeline for Oz Academy, huh?
Big surprise.

10:33.705 --> 10:35.151
Gotcha!

10:36.134 --> 10:39.268
Vulture's gonna be
back in prison by morning.

10:41.117 --> 10:45.018
Ah, ventilation systems.
A spider's best friend.

10:50.236 --> 10:52.150
High-tech motion sensors?

10:52.227 --> 10:54.267
What ever will I do?

10:54.315 --> 10:56.117
♪♪ Humming...

10:57.588 --> 10:59.765
♪♪ Humming...

11:09.682 --> 11:12.235
Tracer says Vultchy
should be through here.

11:16.415 --> 11:18.274
This is what
all the fuss is about?

11:18.454 --> 11:20.813
Oz Academy doesn't seem
all that special.

11:21.321 --> 11:23.126
Ooh, check it!

11:23.204 --> 11:25.672
Must be potential entries
for the Stark Expo.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.501
I'm not exactly supposed to see
what the competition has planned,

11:28.587 --> 11:30.673
but, hey, rules
are meant to be broken.

11:35.712 --> 11:37.779
Time to enroll
in night school.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.676
- Surprise! Guess who.
- What?

11:44.833 --> 11:46.589
- How dare...
- What?

11:46.637 --> 11:48.481
Breaking in
and fighting a teacher?

11:48.629 --> 11:50.777
I learned this from watching you.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.027
Let him go.

11:54.075 --> 11:57.598
Harry... Osborn...
This man is a criminal.

11:57.723 --> 12:00.754
Toomes here almost sent
Max Modell to his tomb.

12:01.034 --> 12:03.044
The professor's
been here for hours.

12:03.092 --> 12:05.618
There's a room full of night-class
students that can prove it.

12:05.666 --> 12:08.131
Wrong. I'm the one
that can prove it.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.373
I put a tracer on...

12:09.450 --> 12:11.994
It's not in this room.

12:12.447 --> 12:13.900
What did you do to it?

12:14.509 --> 12:17.494
No worries. I'll
just get you to confess.

12:17.635 --> 12:20.018
No! Leave him alone!

12:30.928 --> 12:32.111
Harry!

12:32.291 --> 12:33.854
I didn't mean to...

12:34.213 --> 12:36.143
I can't control it!

12:39.573 --> 12:43.291
That was it!
That was the V-252.

12:43.377 --> 12:46.885
Somehow Spider-Man's using
the substance as a costume.

12:47.081 --> 12:50.307
Hmm. No wonder I couldn't
find it at Horizon.

12:50.502 --> 12:55.963
So, Spider-Man has some kind of
inside connection to Horizon High.

12:56.096 --> 12:58.416
That seems shortsighted
on his part.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.822
Perhaps it's time to show him
how superior Osborn Academy is,

13:03.108 --> 13:05.934
by any means necessary.

13:07.619 --> 13:09.690
Is this thing alive?

13:09.742 --> 13:11.541
I could feel its pain.

13:11.776 --> 13:16.026
Maybe it's not just a substance,
but some kind of alien life-form.

13:16.340 --> 13:18.455
My attitude, my aggression...

13:18.572 --> 13:20.146
attacking an unarmed man?

13:20.223 --> 13:22.408
Lashing out at my best friend?

13:22.699 --> 13:26.760
Am I controlling this thing,
or is it controlling me?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.197
Peter,

13:31.299 --> 13:32.947
you'd better not
still be awake.

13:32.995 --> 13:35.579
- You need your rest.
- Cut me some slack!

13:35.797 --> 13:37.549
What did you say
to me, Peter?

13:37.597 --> 13:39.731
I've gotta get
this thing off, now.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.221
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.472
I, uh... I caught
my hand in the door.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.090
I didn't mean to snap at you.

13:47.198 --> 13:50.729
It's okay, Peter.
Just get some rest, please.

13:52.830 --> 13:54.705
So, you're a living thing, huh?

13:54.773 --> 13:55.956
Weird.

13:56.151 --> 13:58.612
I've gotta get you back
to Horizon right now.

13:58.814 --> 14:01.339
But to get across town,
I'm going to need...

14:01.711 --> 14:03.745
my original red and blues.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.944
Yeah. Now, that feels...

14:07.636 --> 14:08.987
What?

14:09.073 --> 14:10.761
Okay, that's creepy.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.810
I need to get you...
off!

14:16.300 --> 14:18.690
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

14:18.804 --> 14:20.737
Don't tell me
that you're adhering to me.

14:23.987 --> 14:26.142
This is like some sort of
invasion of the body grabbers.

14:26.189 --> 14:28.114
Get off me,
you gooey goblin!

14:31.161 --> 14:33.151
Uh-oh.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.222
I think I offended it.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.893
No!

14:44.009 --> 14:47.125
Gotta...
get it out of the house!

14:48.531 --> 14:50.469
If it can make me
lash out at my best friend,

14:50.555 --> 14:52.867
I don't want it anywhere near Aunt May!

14:56.792 --> 14:59.667
Okay. Time to take
this fight to the streets.

14:59.987 --> 15:02.360
I've gotta get us to Horizon!

15:07.587 --> 15:09.353
Aah!

15:10.666 --> 15:13.095
I've had arguments with
myself before...

15:13.331 --> 15:15.097
but never worried
about losing.

15:15.159 --> 15:17.339
Aah! I get it! I get it!

15:17.589 --> 15:20.268
But on this planet,
that's called being needy!

15:21.448 --> 15:23.025
Max Modell's studied you.

15:23.073 --> 15:25.410
Maybe he'll have an idea
of how to get you off me.

15:25.597 --> 15:30.229
Let go! No one likes a backseat,
parasitic, alien web-slinger!

15:35.011 --> 15:37.315
Sorry to interrupt, Spider-Man.

15:37.363 --> 15:38.795
My benefactor would like

15:38.858 --> 15:41.224
- a word with you.
- Vulture!

15:41.389 --> 15:44.042
I'm not taking villain
appointments at the moment.

15:44.147 --> 15:48.401
Oh, you want me to let you go?
Not a problem.

15:54.083 --> 15:58.378
Having difficulty, Spider-Man?

15:58.486 --> 16:01.503
A wardrobe malfunction,
perhaps?

16:01.551 --> 16:03.518
Not really.
What makes you think that?

16:03.582 --> 16:06.190
I'm sorry if the Vulture
was a little rough.

16:06.238 --> 16:09.292
I asked him to bring you here
because I want to help you.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.335
We don't need your help.

16:11.506 --> 16:13.011
"We"?

16:13.112 --> 16:14.847
I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

16:14.895 --> 16:18.886
but speaking on behalf
of your costume is not normal.

16:18.898 --> 16:20.565
What do you want, Norman?

16:20.682 --> 16:22.557
To be friends.

16:22.647 --> 16:25.673
I have to say, I'm a little
jealous of Max Modell.

16:25.836 --> 16:29.307
You and he seem to have a close
relationship. Am I right?

16:29.385 --> 16:31.410
Max Modell is a decent man.

16:31.526 --> 16:34.175
As am I. Ask anyone.

16:34.377 --> 16:37.545
I'm the kind of guy who would give
you the clothes off his back.

16:37.739 --> 16:40.057
And I'd like you
to do the same.

16:40.155 --> 16:43.425
So that's it.
You want the V-252.

16:43.557 --> 16:46.206
I want your cooperation.

16:46.352 --> 16:48.573
But if you give me
the V-252,

16:48.621 --> 16:51.714
we can create something
wonderful together.

16:51.762 --> 16:54.815
No! It belongs to...

16:54.883 --> 16:57.792
Horizon High.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.714
You can't get it off, can you?

17:01.831 --> 17:05.550
Because it's a living Symbiote.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.425
Make the right decision
here, Spider-Man.

17:09.473 --> 17:11.573
Let me help you get it off.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.339
With our resources,
Oz Academy will accomplish

17:14.387 --> 17:18.073
more with that substance in two
years than Horizon will in ten.

17:18.214 --> 17:21.409
No deal. I'll find my
own way to remove it.

17:21.737 --> 17:23.776
I'm sorry to hear that,

17:23.834 --> 17:27.669
because now my security team will
have to take it from you by force,

17:27.717 --> 17:31.206
since you are trespassing
on Oscorp property.

17:31.339 --> 17:33.111
All yours.

17:34.097 --> 17:36.315
I've taken you down
before, Toomes.

17:36.363 --> 17:38.628
Yes. But can you
take down...

17:38.738 --> 17:40.455
Two of us?

17:40.908 --> 17:43.722
So it really wasn't Toomes
that broke into Horizon.

17:43.933 --> 17:47.018
Astute.
And with Dr. Toomes' tech,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.893
I could have a battalion
of Vultures at my fingertips.

17:49.941 --> 17:52.386
Imagine the possibilities.

17:52.567 --> 17:55.573
Better yet,
experience them.

18:01.155 --> 18:03.981
Uncanny.
That creature's interacting

18:04.029 --> 18:06.796
with his nervous system,
empowering him.

18:14.401 --> 18:16.768
The power, the speed!

18:16.930 --> 18:18.875
Why did I want
this thing off me?

18:19.601 --> 18:21.070
Incredible.

18:21.182 --> 18:24.283
Oh, right. The whole
way-too-aggressive thing.

18:34.361 --> 18:36.690
Becoming harder and harder

18:36.948 --> 18:39.690
to control this rage!

18:40.479 --> 18:43.737
Hate to say it, but I might
need their help after all.

18:44.573 --> 18:47.682
Is that a containment device?

18:48.445 --> 18:51.705
You're right, Norman.
I can't do this on my own.

18:52.204 --> 18:55.511
If you're using cadmium telluride
as a superconducting medium,

18:55.678 --> 18:59.089
which clearly you are, then
your brain lives up to its rep.

18:59.307 --> 19:02.292
Welcome to Osborn Academy.

19:02.784 --> 19:05.737
Hey, Vultures,
help me get this thing off.

19:23.089 --> 19:26.950
Yes, now it shall
be mine for the... Wh...

19:27.205 --> 19:29.009
Thanks. I didn't know how I was

19:29.057 --> 19:31.767
- gonna contain this thing.
- No!

19:31.815 --> 19:35.040
Yep!
Horizon High sends their thanks.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.837
I was wrong, Norman.
You were helpful.

19:37.884 --> 19:39.329
Thanks again.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.360
That Symbiote will be mine!

19:46.673 --> 19:51.316
As someday, so will you,
Spider-Man.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.307
Oh. Peter.
What are you doing here?

20:00.368 --> 20:01.908
It's the middle
of the night.

20:02.057 --> 20:04.816
It's just...
Well, here.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.799
The V-252!

20:09.236 --> 20:10.892
How did you find it?

20:11.146 --> 20:13.329
I've... had it all along.

20:13.525 --> 20:15.369
I wanted to run
some of my own tests,

20:15.433 --> 20:18.783
and I kind of...
took it without permission.

20:18.892 --> 20:22.711
Mr. Parker! I'm severely
disappointed in you.

20:22.834 --> 20:27.462
I have no choice but to disqualify
you from the Stark Expo.

20:27.845 --> 20:31.814
You can participate, but your work will
not be counted towards your grade.

20:32.658 --> 20:34.587
But by the same token,

20:34.690 --> 20:36.797
I remember being
an eager young student

20:36.845 --> 20:39.963
wanting to make my mark,
no matter what the cost.

20:40.390 --> 20:42.315
Were you able
to stabilize it?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.009
Sort of.

20:44.099 --> 20:47.439
It's all in the research
I, uh, acquired.

20:47.611 --> 20:51.276
Excellent! Then maybe we have
a shot at winning after all.

20:51.353 --> 20:54.212
We can't use it, Max.
It's not ready.

20:54.260 --> 20:57.556
Look at the research. I think
you'll come to the same conclusion.

20:57.759 --> 20:59.275
I'll study it tonight.

20:59.361 --> 21:02.064
In the meantime,
you should get some rest.

21:02.447 --> 21:04.001
You look exhausted.

21:04.173 --> 21:06.431
Will do, Max.

21:07.154 --> 21:09.220
I'm sure Max will come
to the same conclusion

21:09.296 --> 21:11.548
when he sees
that thing is alive.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.330
Can't say Norman Osborn
would make the same choice.

21:14.558 --> 21:18.040
Is it wrong to experiment on
something potentially groundbreaking

21:18.108 --> 21:20.859
if it also means
causing people harm?

21:21.014 --> 21:24.040
I guess that's what scientists
call a gray area.

21:24.240 --> 21:28.492
Luckily for me, the decision of whether
to move forward with the V-252

21:28.596 --> 21:30.867
is pretty black and white.
