Uh, dad, this is Amanda.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.736

Have what?

00:55.888 --> 00:57.622
Are you ever gonna get
bored of baked beans?

00:57.690 --> 01:02.427
Look. Whatever this is, right,
she doesn't want to be here, ok,

01:02.478 --> 01:03.828
so you dragged her
into it,

01:03.896 --> 01:06.564
and, no, I'm never gonna
get tired of baked beans.

01:06.632 --> 01:08.466
I'm still waiting
for an answer.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.001
I'll see you
at school, ok, Em?

01:10.069 --> 01:11.436
Wait, Amanda. No.

01:12.671 --> 01:15.340
I told you this was
a bad idea.

01:15.407 --> 01:18.042
As you know,
it's not a good idea

01:18.110 --> 01:20.111
until you've tried it.

01:20.162 --> 01:21.212
Eh?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.648
Right. Here comes
the eggs.

01:26.318 --> 01:29.253
Amanda's dad is
in a mental hospital.

01:29.321 --> 01:32.490
Oh. Mental hospital.

01:32.558 --> 01:34.826
He's been there
for 4 years now.

01:34.893 --> 01:37.996
5.

01:38.063 --> 01:40.098
You see how
she did that?

01:40.165 --> 01:43.101
She deliberately said 4

01:43.168 --> 01:45.169
to drag you
into the conversation.

01:45.237 --> 01:46.337
She's slippery like that.

01:46.405 --> 01:50.808
That I get from him.

01:50.876 --> 01:53.311
Emily thinks
I should ask you

01:53.379 --> 01:55.646
if you would like
to...

01:58.984 --> 02:00.752
Look. Never mind.

02:00.819 --> 02:02.086
I'm sure you're
extremely busy,

02:02.154 --> 02:05.656
and I'm probably
just imagining it.

02:05.724 --> 02:08.493
Oi! Amanda!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.828
This much I know,
all right?

02:10.895 --> 02:14.132
You don't think that
you're imagining anything.

02:14.199 --> 02:18.386
Now Emily's no fool,
but I'm even smarter,

02:18.470 --> 02:20.171
so let's have it.

02:20.239 --> 02:22.807
What's the problem,
and how can I help?

02:24.877 --> 02:26.978
In the 5 years that
he's been there,

02:27.046 --> 02:29.981
I'm not sure if they've
actually been helping him

02:30.049 --> 02:31.682
or they're just trying
to see how long

02:31.750 --> 02:33.017
they can keep him.

02:33.085 --> 02:34.652
All right. Let me guess.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.921
A private hospital,
right?

02:36.989 --> 02:44.962
Yeah. It's like he's always
medicated, never himself.

02:45.030 --> 02:48.566
I just want my dad back,
Dr. Lightman.

Wayne Dobar!

03:15.127 --> 03:16.961
My daughter...

03:18.230 --> 03:19.697
Is a friend
of your daughter,

03:19.765 --> 03:22.100
and she wanted me
to come by,

03:22.167 --> 03:23.267
see how you
were doing,

03:23.335 --> 03:24.669
say hello,
and that.

03:26.772 --> 03:28.940
Ah. The silent type.

03:31.543 --> 03:34.162
You're invisible.
So's your fruit.

03:34.246 --> 03:36.214
So are you.

03:36.281 --> 03:40.651
You're invisible.
So's your fruit. So are you.

03:40.719 --> 03:42.987
You hate bullies,
don't you?

03:43.055 --> 03:44.055
To tell you
the truth,

03:44.123 --> 03:45.956
I'm not a shrink
or nothing,

03:46.008 --> 03:52.196
but don't they tell you
to let your anger out?

03:52.264 --> 03:55.700
You're invisible.
So's your fruit. So are you.

03:57.569 --> 03:59.537
You're invisible.
So's your fruit.

03:59.605 --> 04:02.190
So--aah!

04:05.577 --> 04:08.146
Aah!

04:08.213 --> 04:10.314
Aah! Aah!

04:10.382 --> 04:12.049
Aah!

04:18.957 --> 04:20.124
Guys! Hey!

04:20.192 --> 04:21.959
He attacked me
with a knife!

04:22.027 --> 04:23.694
He attacked me
with a knife!

04:23.762 --> 04:25.830
Stop it right there,
Mr. Dobar.

04:25.898 --> 04:30.001
Wayne, put
the knife down, please.

04:30.068 --> 04:32.637
Do as Dr. Grandon
says, Wayne.

04:34.506 --> 04:38.910
Excuse me, but..

04:38.977 --> 04:42.346
You see the little
loony behind you

04:42.414 --> 04:44.182
with the apple?

04:44.249 --> 04:45.733
He's the one that
had the knife.

04:45.817 --> 04:49.020
Wayne here's got it because
he took it off him.

04:49.087 --> 04:51.956
He was doing your job,
big fella.

04:52.023 --> 04:56.427
Weren't you just leaving,
Dr. Lightman?

04:56.495 --> 04:58.529
Yes, we know
who you are.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.031
Hmm.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.467
That's a bit previous.

05:03.535 --> 05:07.221
I mean, the man's scared.
He's not dangerous.

05:11.543 --> 05:13.511
His eyebrows
tell you that?

05:13.579 --> 05:15.213
This is a psychiatric facility,

05:15.280 --> 05:17.081
not a circus.

05:25.624 --> 05:29.594
What am I gonna tell
your daughter, eh?

05:35.867 --> 05:37.868
Nice one.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.122
And all of a sudden,

05:58.190 --> 06:01.492
I'm interested
in you, bozo.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.978
You've
already decided

06:37.062 --> 06:39.563
this Dr. Grandon
is hiding something.

06:39.631 --> 06:42.166
Maybe, maybe not.

06:42.234 --> 06:44.151
But you're hoping
he is.

06:44.236 --> 06:47.672
Of course I am.

06:47.739 --> 06:49.874
What are you doing?

06:49.941 --> 06:54.278
I'll bet you that
Dr. Grandon

06:54.346 --> 06:56.614
is on his way here
right now.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.883
I know the type.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.051
We have mice?

07:00.118 --> 07:01.185
Could be rats.

07:01.253 --> 07:03.321
Ever heard
of pest control?

07:03.388 --> 07:04.722
Ever heard
of a sporting chance?

07:04.790 --> 07:06.841
That's expensive-looking
cheese.

07:06.925 --> 07:09.877
A fiver says that
Dr. Grandon

07:09.961 --> 07:12.163
will be here
within the hour.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.882
Well, why would he
do that?

07:14.966 --> 07:16.667
Oh. Thank you
very much.

07:18.303 --> 07:21.205
Ahh. To make nice

07:21.273 --> 07:23.307
because I see what's
going on there.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.776
The last thing
he wants

07:25.844 --> 07:28.696
is me rattling
his cage, right?

07:28.780 --> 07:31.182
Which you've already
started to do anyway.

07:31.249 --> 07:33.951
A friend of Emily's
asked for my help.

07:34.019 --> 07:37.238
I mean, everyone needs
their dad, right?

07:37.322 --> 07:39.724
Yeah, but so far,
all you've managed to do

07:39.791 --> 07:44.161
is potentially make
matters worse.

07:44.212 --> 07:46.630
Do we know why
Wayne Dobar was admitted

07:46.698 --> 07:48.432
in the first place?

07:56.341 --> 07:58.776
Ta-da!

07:58.844 --> 08:00.010
Oh. Long walk

08:00.078 --> 08:01.879
on a short bridge, huh?

08:01.947 --> 08:03.046
So maybe Wayne is

08:03.098 --> 08:04.348
a nutter after all.

08:04.399 --> 08:06.984
Thank you.

08:07.052 --> 08:07.952
And here is.

08:08.019 --> 08:10.521
That's 44 minutes later.

08:10.589 --> 08:11.789
You owe me a fiver.

08:11.857 --> 08:14.892
And excuse me?
"Ta-da"?

08:14.960 --> 08:15.993
I mean, really.

08:16.061 --> 08:17.995
Hi. I'm
Gillian Foster.

08:18.063 --> 08:20.164
Dr. Mitch Grandon.
How do you do?

08:20.232 --> 08:21.499
I came here to ask
the reason

08:21.566 --> 08:23.401
for Dr. Lightman's
visit earlier

08:23.468 --> 08:25.803
and, if it involved
the well-being of a patient

08:25.871 --> 08:27.638
or concern of relatives,

08:27.706 --> 08:29.840
to offer any assistance
I can.

08:31.076 --> 08:33.344
I'm sorry. I just--
I must have drifted off.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.847
Where am I?
Wh--what did I miss?

08:36.914 --> 08:38.282
We need to be able
to tell

08:38.350 --> 08:39.650
Wayne Dobar's
daughter

08:39.717 --> 08:40.951
that he's
in good hands.

08:41.019 --> 08:43.120
I can assure you he
is in the best hands...

08:43.188 --> 08:44.989
That money
can buy, right?

08:45.056 --> 08:46.891
Um, Loker,
on your mark, son.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.894
Maestro, over to you.

08:49.961 --> 08:52.062
This is a sad,
confused man

08:52.130 --> 08:53.597
just moments away
from remorse,

08:53.665 --> 08:54.799
but he's not
a violent man.

08:54.866 --> 08:56.967
He wasn't gonna jump.

08:57.035 --> 08:59.036
That place that
you run--

08:59.104 --> 09:00.604
Radley. Yeah, Radley.
That's it, yeah.

09:00.672 --> 09:02.606
Pricey?

09:02.674 --> 09:04.975
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

09:05.043 --> 09:06.377
I'm sorry. Do what?

09:06.445 --> 09:08.312
Answer his question
with another question.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.014
Just saying.

09:10.081 --> 09:12.283
Such as
what price does

09:12.350 --> 09:14.385
one put on the care
and well-being

09:14.453 --> 09:16.454
of the mentally ill?

09:16.521 --> 09:17.988
I wasn't going
to say that.

09:18.056 --> 09:18.989
Yeah, you were.

09:19.057 --> 09:21.124
I mean, that's what
I would say anyway.

09:21.176 --> 09:22.726
I mean, what else
can you say?

09:22.794 --> 09:26.030
Excellent.
Your read my mind.

09:29.134 --> 09:30.734
Well, now it's time
for you to read mine.

09:30.802 --> 09:32.136
Go on then.

09:34.439 --> 09:35.523
Too hard for you?
All right.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.741
Let me give you
a clue, all right?

09:37.809 --> 09:39.343
You run a 5-star
loony bin

09:39.411 --> 09:41.145
in the middle
of a recession.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.948
Now is not the time to
start bleeding patients.

09:44.015 --> 09:45.499
Have you been giving
Wayne Dobar

09:45.584 --> 09:49.220
a little bit of the old,
you know, woof woof,

09:49.287 --> 09:51.755
a little extra just to
slow down his recovery

09:51.823 --> 09:54.225
in the name
of good business?

09:54.292 --> 09:55.626
I beg your pardon?

09:55.694 --> 09:56.794
What Dr. Lightman is saying is

09:56.845 --> 09:58.662
since Wayne hasn't
shown much improvement

09:58.730 --> 10:00.431
in 5 years
of treatment,

10:00.499 --> 10:03.133
maybe I could help you
with a second opinion.

10:06.271 --> 10:10.307
Well, I for one thought I was being
really bloody clear about that.

10:17.861 --> 10:19.695
Oh, please don't.
Thoroughbreds can be a little jumpy

10:19.763 --> 10:21.363
around strangers.

10:21.414 --> 10:24.049
So how is
my brother?

10:24.134 --> 10:26.101
Dr. Lightman's going
back to see him now.

10:26.169 --> 10:27.753
Didn't Amanda
tell you that?

10:27.838 --> 10:29.238
Amanda? No.

10:29.306 --> 10:31.640
Yeah. She asked him
to check up on Wayne.

10:31.708 --> 10:33.058
She feels that
the doctors might be

10:33.143 --> 10:36.111
being a little generous
with his medication.

10:36.179 --> 10:37.513
Is Wayne ok?

10:37.581 --> 10:40.549
He's fine.

10:40.617 --> 10:43.652
So is Amanda
in the house, Ms. Dobar?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.788
Gina, please.
I wish you'd called ahead.

10:45.856 --> 10:47.189
I could have saved you
both a trip.

10:47.257 --> 10:49.391
So she's not here.

10:49.459 --> 10:50.793
No. She had to go
to Maryland.

10:50.861 --> 10:53.896
Regional playoffs.
Volleyball.

10:53.964 --> 10:56.031
Really?

10:56.099 --> 10:57.366
Really.

10:57.434 --> 10:58.868
He lives here
with you, though?

10:58.935 --> 11:02.471
After her father
went, uh...

11:02.539 --> 11:06.775
With her mother gone--
childbirth, awful--

11:06.843 --> 11:09.044
I'm all Amanda
has left.

11:09.112 --> 11:12.047
Well, when will
she be back?

11:12.115 --> 11:14.950
Is Wayne all right?
You're scaring me.

11:15.018 --> 11:16.752
Dr. Lightman
and Dr. Foster are doing

11:16.820 --> 11:18.654
everything they can.

11:20.924 --> 11:23.259
Thank you.

11:25.262 --> 11:26.595
I should
warn you--one of the symptoms

11:26.663 --> 11:28.163
of Wayne's
schizoaffective disorder

11:28.231 --> 11:31.267
is that often he doesn't speak at
all to people he doesn't trust.

11:31.334 --> 11:34.370
What? You mean, like he
didn't speak to you earlier?

11:40.911 --> 11:42.411
After you.

11:48.652 --> 11:50.419
Wayne, this is Gill.

11:50.487 --> 11:52.187
Gill, Wayne.
Wayne, Gill.

11:57.727 --> 11:59.962
Well, you heard the man.

12:00.030 --> 12:01.597
You can leave now.

12:01.665 --> 12:04.333
Are you saying that
he wants--

12:04.401 --> 12:07.703
are you sure?
Wayne, should I leave?

12:07.771 --> 12:08.938
No. I want you to leave.

12:09.005 --> 12:11.340
I want him
to trust me, yeah.

12:11.408 --> 12:13.308
Hang on a sec.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.544
Here.

12:15.612 --> 12:17.246
Can I borrow
your lipstick?

12:17.314 --> 12:19.949
Right.

12:20.016 --> 12:21.316
Right.

12:24.287 --> 12:27.256
I'm doing this
right in front of you

12:27.324 --> 12:31.260
so that I don't have to ask
you to switch it off later,

12:31.328 --> 12:32.695
and then you don't
have to say--

12:32.762 --> 12:33.996
I can't let
you do that.

12:34.064 --> 12:35.297
Exactly.

12:35.365 --> 12:37.566
But, doctor, you just stood
there and watch him do it.

12:44.140 --> 12:46.308
Ooh. Juice time.

12:48.611 --> 12:50.362
Yeah.

12:50.447 --> 12:55.517
Right. Well, Wayne,
here's to you then

12:55.585 --> 12:58.387
for what you did to
fruit bandit earlier.

12:58.455 --> 12:59.989
Do you want some?

13:00.056 --> 13:01.890
What? You don't
like it?

13:01.958 --> 13:03.625
You don't trust it?

13:03.693 --> 13:05.627
You don't know what
they put in it?

13:05.695 --> 13:07.463
All right.
All the more for me then.

13:07.530 --> 13:09.865
Wayne?

13:09.933 --> 13:12.434
Wayne.

13:12.502 --> 13:13.702
Do you mind?

13:15.105 --> 13:16.839
Oh, ok.

13:23.546 --> 13:28.884
You must miss Amanda
like I don't know what, eh?

13:31.721 --> 13:34.156
Well, at least
they give you a view

13:34.224 --> 13:36.291
or not.

13:36.359 --> 13:37.893
The last time Amanda
wrote to you

13:37.961 --> 13:40.696
was, uh--was it
April 10?

13:40.764 --> 13:42.865
That's months ago.

13:47.070 --> 13:51.140
You're worried
about her.

13:51.207 --> 13:54.043
Let's talk a little bit
more, shall we,

13:54.110 --> 13:56.311
about your view.

14:06.356 --> 14:09.892
Hey, hey.
Naughty, naughty.

14:11.561 --> 14:13.562
So Amanda's a friend
of your daughter?

14:13.630 --> 14:15.164
It speaks.

14:17.801 --> 14:21.870
So you're not only worried
about Amanda, are you?

14:21.938 --> 14:25.074
You think that this is
your only way out of here,

14:25.141 --> 14:27.910
don't you?

14:27.977 --> 14:29.945
You're at the end
of your rope.

14:32.315 --> 14:33.715
Right.

14:36.519 --> 14:39.621
Go on then. Up it.

14:39.672 --> 14:41.023
This is your chance.
Go on.

14:41.091 --> 14:45.294
But once you're gone,
I can't help you.

14:45.361 --> 14:48.297
You're on your own then.

14:48.364 --> 14:52.801
Or stay,
and he's all yours.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.898
Richmond Dobar,
Wayne and Gina's dad.

15:06.998 --> 15:08.232
One of
the 10 richest

15:08.300 --> 15:09.633
race horse owners
in the world,

15:09.701 --> 15:11.602
diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia

15:11.670 --> 15:12.937
in 1979.

15:13.004 --> 15:14.705
Treated privately
in his home,

15:14.773 --> 15:16.006
and then two years later...

15:16.074 --> 15:17.341
He was found hanging
from the ceiling

15:17.409 --> 15:18.742
of his condo
in Dubai.

15:18.810 --> 15:21.946
Looks like Wayne's condition
might be hereditary.

15:22.013 --> 15:26.083
So was there any history of
Wayne losing his marbles

15:26.151 --> 15:27.818
before he walked out
on that bridge?

15:27.886 --> 15:29.787
No, at least not
on record.

15:29.855 --> 15:31.622
What did you find out
from the sister?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.258
Gina Dobar continues her
father's work successfully

15:34.326 --> 15:35.993
according to this.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.062
I think Amanda was at the
house when we were there,

15:38.130 --> 15:40.164
but she wouldn't
let us see her.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.767
She kept deflecting
the question.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.639
So I have to say,
Ms. Dobar,

15:48.707 --> 15:51.008
I would have expected you
to be happy to hear that.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.977
You spent 5 minutes
with Wayne

15:53.044 --> 15:56.180
and now tell me that he should
be released altogether?

15:56.248 --> 15:59.250
I suppose I'm more
confused than anything.

15:59.317 --> 16:04.255
Tell me about the day that he
took Amanda out onto the bridge?

16:04.322 --> 16:07.141
There's nothing much
to say really.

16:07.225 --> 16:08.959
I got a call
from the police

16:09.027 --> 16:11.929
once it was all over and
he was already in custody.

16:11.997 --> 16:14.331
It was so unlike
him, but...

16:14.399 --> 16:16.433
But it all added up.

16:16.485 --> 16:20.504
I mean, family history being
what family history is, right?

16:20.572 --> 16:22.173
You know
about my father.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.042
Yeah. Why didn't you
tell the truth

16:25.110 --> 16:26.660
to my people
earlier today?

16:26.745 --> 16:27.745
Excuse me?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.313
You told them
Amanda wasn't here,

16:29.381 --> 16:32.349
and you also ducked the issue
of Wayne being overmedicated.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.985
For what earthly reason would
they overmedicate him?

16:35.053 --> 16:36.587
I don't know.

16:36.655 --> 16:40.090
Money? Your money?

16:40.158 --> 16:41.692
But how can
Amanda help?

16:41.760 --> 16:45.296
Well, I can't answer that until
I've talked to her, can I?

16:47.399 --> 16:48.966
Oi!

16:52.737 --> 16:53.904
We got lost, right,

16:53.972 --> 16:56.173
because we came
from a big kitchen

16:56.241 --> 16:58.375
to a small kitchen
to, like, a--

16:58.443 --> 16:59.777
what do you call it?

16:59.844 --> 17:00.778
A pantry.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.146
Yeah. One of them.

17:06.050 --> 17:09.053
I'm making conversation to break the ice.
How am I doing?

17:09.119 --> 17:10.588
Am I all right?

17:15.126 --> 17:20.731
Amanda
Emily's been trying to call you.

17:20.799 --> 17:23.133
You do still want us
to help you,

17:23.201 --> 17:25.868
don't you, love?

17:25.936 --> 17:27.137
How's my dad?

17:27.204 --> 17:29.340
He's worried sick
about you.

17:29.407 --> 17:30.474
I'm ok.

17:30.542 --> 17:31.875
Yeah, I can tell.

17:37.115 --> 17:38.816
Mind if I do?

17:40.352 --> 17:42.586
Thank you
very much.

17:42.654 --> 17:44.922
They're banana nut,
right?

17:44.990 --> 17:47.024
Lovely.

17:47.092 --> 17:48.192
You know what we
want to talk

17:48.260 --> 17:51.462
to you about,
don't you, Amanda?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.030
The bridge.

17:57.168 --> 18:01.205
He was taking me
to get ice cream,

18:01.273 --> 18:03.374
and the store was just
on the other side.

18:03.441 --> 18:05.342
It's not there anymore,

18:05.410 --> 18:07.678
but we used to go there
every Saturday,

18:07.746 --> 18:11.548
and he would get
pistachio one scoop,

18:11.616 --> 18:14.451
and I would get
strawberry, two scoops

18:14.519 --> 18:16.820
with sprinkles.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.423
And then it all went
pear-shaped, right?

18:21.626 --> 18:27.364
So what happened
that day then?

18:27.432 --> 18:29.700
I don't really
remember.

18:29.768 --> 18:31.235
It was like
a bad dream, you know?

18:31.303 --> 18:34.638
But in spite
of everything,

18:34.706 --> 18:36.807
you still love
your dad, right?

18:36.875 --> 18:39.310
It wasn't his fault.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.211
I mean, he's sick.

18:43.148 --> 18:47.384
My mum was bonkers
back in the day,

18:47.452 --> 18:52.122
and the thing that
scared me most

18:52.190 --> 18:55.109
was that...

18:55.193 --> 18:56.293
That it would run
in the family,

18:56.361 --> 18:59.797
you know, that I'd
end up like her.

18:59.864 --> 19:04.435
I am not--
I'm not like my dad.

19:07.839 --> 19:09.973
I'm nothing
like my mum.

19:11.509 --> 19:13.110
Except, well,
if you count the time

19:13.178 --> 19:15.379
when I mooned
the Queen.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.447
Of England?

19:16.514 --> 19:22.252
Yeah. I don't know what
come over me really.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.723
Can you tell us why you
stopped writing your dad?

19:25.790 --> 19:29.860
I don't know.
Volleyball, summer school.

19:29.928 --> 19:32.496
Ah.

19:32.564 --> 19:36.300
What is it you don't
want us to see in that book?

19:36.368 --> 19:39.269
Can I have a look,
darling?

19:39.337 --> 19:42.539
We won't tell
anyone, promise.

20:13.805 --> 20:17.541
Ok. That's enough.

20:17.609 --> 20:19.009
All right, love.

20:22.447 --> 20:26.517
These are letters
from Wayne to me.

20:26.584 --> 20:29.520
Why do you want to
give them to us?

20:29.587 --> 20:32.956
He told me that Amanda
had stopped writing to him.

20:33.024 --> 20:36.860
Wayne's a good man.
You'll see,

20:36.928 --> 20:41.665
but he's also troubled.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.300
Like Amanda, I could
use some reassurance

20:43.368 --> 20:47.438
that he's getting
the right help, so...

20:47.505 --> 20:49.273
Anything you need.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.073
I can see
why Gina was so anxious

21:06.157 --> 21:07.658
for us to see these.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.626
There are a lot of
inconsistencies in the language.

21:09.694 --> 21:11.428
I mean, some reveal
moments of lucidity,

21:11.496 --> 21:14.898
but most are erratic, incoherent,
endless digressions,

21:14.966 --> 21:16.366
fragments
of fragments.

21:18.136 --> 21:19.770
What's wrong?

21:19.838 --> 21:22.239
Nothing. I'm just
knackered, you know?

21:22.307 --> 21:24.274
It's like he's
on posh drugs,

21:24.342 --> 21:27.478
you know, the sort
that shrinks

21:27.545 --> 21:29.379
for rich-and-famous people
give their customers

21:29.430 --> 21:30.547
to keep them around,
you know?

21:30.598 --> 21:34.417
Or Wayne's really
not well, Cal.

21:34.469 --> 21:36.820
Cal? Please tell me
you're not thinking

21:36.888 --> 21:39.022
about going to grill
Dr. Grandon now.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.493
No. I'm not.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.361
It's late.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.498
I'm tired, and there's nothing
we can do now, right?

21:47.565 --> 21:49.600
We have to figure out a way
to handle this carefully.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.969
What? You think I can't
do that, don't you?

21:52.036 --> 21:53.937
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

21:54.005 --> 21:56.440
Oh, yeah?
Hey.

21:56.508 --> 21:58.542
Right.

22:04.516 --> 22:06.967
What's in the box,
Wayne?

22:07.051 --> 22:08.168
It's private.

22:08.253 --> 22:09.820
Oh, yeah?
Fair enough.

22:09.888 --> 22:11.688
Come on then.
Follow me.

22:11.756 --> 22:12.856
Where are we going?

22:12.924 --> 22:14.791
I'm taking you
home, mate.

22:28.439 --> 22:33.610
So what was in that juice
that I drunk earlier?

22:33.678 --> 22:36.813
Dr. Lightman, what are you
doing here at this hour?

22:36.881 --> 22:41.151
Well, Wayne is not
mental,

22:41.219 --> 22:46.189
so me and him, we're
busting out of here.

22:46.257 --> 22:48.358
What's it look like
I'm doing?

22:48.426 --> 22:53.797
From where I'm standing, it looks
like you're not feeling so well.

22:57.702 --> 22:59.202
Oh.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.374
Ohh!

23:04.442 --> 23:05.609
Wait a minute.

23:13.451 --> 23:17.588
Get him to a secure room
under observation.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.633
Hello, mum.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.515
Fancy seeing you
in here.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.690
Well, you took
your bloody time, didn't you?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.593
You look good, mum.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.762
Death's done you
proud.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.175
Oi. Can I have some
more drugs in here?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.644
Make it snappy.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.647
You always did make
me laugh, Cal.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.849
I ever tell you that?

24:10.917 --> 24:11.883
I don't remember.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.119
Oh, don't be
daft, you.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.592
I remember you used to
make me laugh.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.962
Do you remember that
holiday we all went on?

24:24.030 --> 24:25.964
There was the 3 of us
sitting on the beach,

24:26.032 --> 24:27.599
me, you, and dad.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.334
Watching other people
through binoculars.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.937
Do you remember?
Putting words in their mouths

24:32.004 --> 24:36.007
like we could tell what they were
actually saying to each other.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.410
Is that you who
made that noise, darling?

24:38.477 --> 24:41.980
No. It was the ferry
going by, you rude man.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.716
I didn't know a ferry could
make a smell like that.

24:54.794 --> 24:58.697
Why'd you do it, eh?

24:58.764 --> 24:59.998
Do what?

25:00.065 --> 25:01.233
Paint the living room
yellow.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.567
What do you think,
you sloppy cow?

25:02.618 --> 25:08.039
I admit Dr.
Lightman may be a little unusual,

25:08.107 --> 25:12.744
but this is-- what did you give him?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.412
The broke
an orderly's nose.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.250
We gave him
a sedative.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.119
Just to be clear,
the law says--

25:21.187 --> 25:22.621
you either have to
file a police report

25:22.688 --> 25:23.788
or hold him
for 48 hours

25:23.856 --> 25:25.624
if there's any evidence he's a danger

25:25.691 --> 25:27.325
to himself
or others.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.526
I know.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.830
I wasn't in my
right mind, love.

25:31.898 --> 25:35.033
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.969
Well, why didn't you just
divorce him or run away?

25:38.037 --> 25:42.974
There must have been someone
that could have helped you.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.511
You got to stop
blaming yourself, Cal.

25:46.579 --> 25:50.682
Do you hear me?

25:50.750 --> 25:56.755
I wish you could see
your granddaughter Emily.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.324
Who's she like?

25:59.392 --> 26:02.694
She's herself.
She's like herself.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.296
All right.

26:06.599 --> 26:09.267
I won't ask.
Don't have to say.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.537
Well, she's a little bit
like you, yeah, maybe.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.142
Don't go, mum.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.081
Medication time, I hope.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.935
Oh, come on.
You gave him something.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.470
Yeah. A sedative.

26:45.538 --> 26:47.739
We don't administer
hallucinogens here.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.442
See, I would agree
with you there,

26:50.509 --> 26:52.277
but I just went
for a trip

26:52.345 --> 26:54.229
down memory lane
with my mum.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.347
Thank you so much
for that.

26:56.399 --> 26:58.249
Call me if you need me,
Dr. Foster.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.071
So you had to
come here.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.156
I thought we were
gonna wait

27:05.224 --> 27:06.391
and do it together.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.026
Really?
Mm-hmm.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.628
Look...

27:10.696 --> 27:12.697
Tell the truth,
darling.

27:14.717 --> 27:19.004
You're know that was
never going to happen.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.605
You attacked
that orderly.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.740
Do you want to tell
me what on earth

27:21.807 --> 27:23.174
was going through your
mind at the time?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.225
The bridge of his nose.
All right.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.543
This isn't you that
I'm talking to.

27:25.611 --> 27:26.845
This is the drugs.
I got to figure out

27:26.912 --> 27:27.912
a way to get you
out of here.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.015
Shh, shh.
Easy, tiger.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.885
You know, walls
have ears and that.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.570
So...

27:44.613 --> 27:47.231
Let's go for a walk
and take the dog.

27:47.283 --> 27:48.249
No, no, no. Sit.

27:50.286 --> 27:52.871
Honey, where
are you going?

28:00.412 --> 28:02.414
You do know that
they're keeping you

28:02.481 --> 28:05.050
topped up on drugs,
don't you?

28:07.970 --> 28:10.488
Only after I attack
someone.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.490
Every other time...

28:23.202 --> 28:24.702
Ria.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.037
Emily, what are you
doing here?

28:26.105 --> 28:29.040
Where's my dad?
And don't lie for him this time.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.642
He never came home
last night,

28:30.709 --> 28:33.344
and his phone goes
straight to voice mail.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.981
He's trying to help out
your friend's father.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.250
All I can say is that this
probably part of some plan.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.885
You know how
your dad is.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.488
He's done something
crazy again, hasn't he?

28:50.362 --> 28:51.362
You ready?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.665
No, not really.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.413
Loker.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.450
Loker, get a pen,
all right?

29:45.518 --> 29:46.985
Yeah. What do
you got?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.890
Dad?

29:51.957 --> 29:54.359
Em, what are you
doing there?

29:54.426 --> 29:56.995
They said you were
in the hospital.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.997
All right. Put Loker back
on the phone, all right?

29:59.048 --> 30:00.999
But, dad-- don't argue
with me, darling.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.967
Everything will
be all right.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.503
Go on. Please, em.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.205
Don't muck about.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.514
Yeah. Go ahead.

30:16.565 --> 30:20.919
Right. Take
this down, ok?

30:26.408 --> 30:28.092
Olanzapine.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.330
La-mo-tri-gine.

30:33.866 --> 30:37.035
Lam-o-tri-gine.

30:37.102 --> 30:40.405
Topiramate.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.207
L-lorazepam.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.777
Chico.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.246
No. I made that one up.
That was a joke.

30:51.584 --> 30:55.320
Oh, mate.
I'm high as a kite.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.422
They what?
They drugged you?

30:57.489 --> 30:59.090
Yeah, love.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.225
Cal?

31:00.292 --> 31:01.926
Yeah, what?

31:01.994 --> 31:05.730
Dr. Lightman.

31:05.798 --> 31:07.949
You got any
painkillers?

31:08.033 --> 31:10.985
I got
a blinding headache.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.706
Go quietly this time,
Cal, please.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.107
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.509
Oh. Hold on. Ok.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.278
Dad? Dad?

31:22.450 --> 31:23.384
48 hours?

31:23.451 --> 31:25.755
There's nothing I can do
about that, em.

31:25.855 --> 31:27.089
It's the law.

31:27.156 --> 31:28.290
Did he do this
deliberately?

31:28.358 --> 31:29.958
You'll have to ask
him that yourself.

31:30.026 --> 31:31.026
That means he did.

31:31.094 --> 31:33.128
Well, he's helping out
your friend's father.

31:33.196 --> 31:34.596
Oh. So this is
all my fault?

31:34.664 --> 31:37.199
What? For asking
for help? Emily, no.

31:37.266 --> 31:41.370
I just--I just wish he'd
write books and teach.

31:41.437 --> 31:44.706
And, I mean, even if he
did do this on purpose,

31:44.774 --> 31:47.275
how could you
let him?

31:47.343 --> 31:49.911
Em, come--sit down.

31:49.979 --> 31:52.848
Look.

31:52.915 --> 31:55.517
Look. I know
it sounds bad,

31:55.585 --> 31:58.286
but he's safe.

31:58.354 --> 32:00.689
Even so, you're scared
about something.

32:00.757 --> 32:02.724
What are you
scared of?

32:02.792 --> 32:04.893
You--you can
see that?

32:04.961 --> 32:09.164
Well, I guessed.
Trick my dad taught me.

32:09.232 --> 32:14.002
Oh. Your dad...

32:14.070 --> 32:17.506
Seems like he's under
a lot of stress.

32:17.573 --> 32:20.575
I mean, there's more on
his mind than usual.

32:20.643 --> 32:23.111
Yeah, especially now.

32:23.179 --> 32:24.379
Why would you
say that?

32:24.447 --> 32:26.314
Next week,
it's his birthday.

32:26.382 --> 32:27.582
Yeah, but he always
stresses out about that.

32:27.650 --> 32:28.984
I mean, that's why every
year we pretend like

32:29.052 --> 32:30.252
it's not even
happening.

32:30.319 --> 32:34.022
Yes, but my grandma died
when she was 46,

32:34.090 --> 32:37.459
and he's turning 47.

33:01.217 --> 33:03.285
Ooh!

33:03.352 --> 33:04.820
All right, dad?

33:06.756 --> 33:08.790
What'd you do
that for?

33:08.858 --> 33:10.759
I thought you wanted
to have a chat.

33:10.827 --> 33:12.661
Yeah. About what,
mate?

33:12.728 --> 33:15.697
I don't know.
You tell me.

33:15.765 --> 33:17.766
Bollocks,
you don't know.

33:27.577 --> 33:29.744
It wasn't all me,
you know?

33:29.812 --> 33:32.514
Your mother had something
to do with it.

33:32.582 --> 33:34.549
It takes two,
as they say.

33:34.617 --> 33:35.984
It takes two to do
what-- go down the pub,

33:36.052 --> 33:37.519
get drunk
every night

33:37.587 --> 33:39.654
and come back
rat-assed,

33:39.722 --> 33:41.723
knock your wife
and kid about?

33:44.994 --> 33:48.380
Remember those holidays
at the beach?

33:48.464 --> 33:51.566
One holiday, one.

33:51.634 --> 33:54.369
We stayed in a room
above a pub,

33:54.437 --> 33:56.972
and it rained
the whole bloody time.

33:59.775 --> 34:04.079
You know, it's not mum I need to
worry about taking after, is it?

34:04.147 --> 34:05.480
It's you.

34:07.817 --> 34:09.417
Right?

34:13.255 --> 34:14.856
You still here?

34:22.764 --> 34:26.301
Good. Let's keep it
that way.

34:41.350 --> 34:43.652
Where's Foster?

34:43.719 --> 34:45.687
She's with Emily.

34:45.755 --> 34:50.108
That is because you--
bloody idiot that you are--

34:50.193 --> 34:52.893
told em all
about this, right?

34:56.132 --> 34:58.233
None of the drugs that
you had me research

34:58.301 --> 35:01.403
would have caused the
reaction that you're having.

35:01.470 --> 35:02.604
Keep checking.

35:02.672 --> 35:04.472
They're sedatives, they're
mood stabilizers.

35:04.540 --> 35:08.210
They're not
hallucinogens.

35:08.277 --> 35:10.679
What do you know
about my hallucinations?

35:10.746 --> 35:14.316
Nothing.
Just that you've been having them.

35:14.383 --> 35:16.251
You think Foster
would tell us?

35:28.197 --> 35:29.698
What if...

35:29.765 --> 35:33.285
Right, someone
gave me a cocktail

35:33.369 --> 35:35.270
of all those drugs?

35:35.338 --> 35:37.739
Like in your food
or in your drink?

35:37.807 --> 35:41.626
Yeah.
Hey!

35:41.711 --> 35:44.312
Take this
and sod off.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.415
Are you stealing other
patients' food, Dr. Lightman?

35:47.483 --> 35:48.917
Excuse me?!

35:48.985 --> 35:50.085
Those are my muffins.
Those are his.

35:50.136 --> 35:51.553
They're my muffins.
These are your muffins?

35:51.620 --> 35:53.021
Yeah, my muffins.
These are your muffins?

35:53.089 --> 35:54.155
My muffins.

35:54.223 --> 35:56.825
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:56.892 --> 35:58.326
You know...

36:02.298 --> 36:06.735
These muffins might just turn
out to be your problem, mate.

36:24.453 --> 36:27.489
You are aware,
Dr. Lightman,

36:27.556 --> 36:29.958
that this evaluation
is to determine

36:30.026 --> 36:35.230
whether I can allow you to leave
the care of this hospital.

36:42.338 --> 36:43.271
Yes.

36:43.339 --> 36:44.773
And you're telling
me the reason

36:44.840 --> 36:49.144
for your behavior is
a homemade muffin?

36:49.211 --> 36:51.146
He is.

36:51.213 --> 36:56.518
And you know this because you
ate one of these muffins?

36:56.585 --> 37:01.156
Wayne Dobar has been
eating them for years.

37:01.223 --> 37:02.324
You really
believe that?

37:02.391 --> 37:03.491
His daughter
makes them for him.

37:03.559 --> 37:08.596
His daughter, all of
17, is poisoning him?

37:08.664 --> 37:12.067
What? No. She has no idea
about any of this.

37:13.836 --> 37:14.969
What are you
doing here?

37:15.037 --> 37:17.072
I sent part of that muffin
to the lab for testing,

37:17.139 --> 37:19.374
but I also tested
it myself,

37:19.442 --> 37:21.643
which ended up being
a little faster.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.482
Ever heard of the Salem Witch Trials?

37:27.550 --> 37:28.850
Historians
believe that

37:28.918 --> 37:30.085
the Salem Witch Trials were caused

37:30.152 --> 37:32.954
by a hallucinogenic
fungus called ergot,

37:33.022 --> 37:37.792
which found its way into
the winter bread supply.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.928
All right.
Let's see how magical

37:39.995 --> 37:43.631
this muffin really is.

37:43.699 --> 37:47.202
It's moist,
it's a little bitter.

37:47.269 --> 37:49.371
Overall, it's not
that bad.

37:55.845 --> 37:58.546
Really? Mr. Fitzgerald,
Mr. Fitzgerald

37:58.614 --> 37:59.881
said that to you?

37:59.949 --> 38:02.684
Mr. Fitzgerald?
Really?

38:17.099 --> 38:21.736
So bread-- or in this case a muffin--

38:21.787 --> 38:23.671
is the perfect
delivery system.

38:23.739 --> 38:26.040
The same one you
used on Wayne.

38:29.645 --> 38:31.479
This is ridiculous.

38:31.547 --> 38:32.831
Come on, Amanda.
Let's go.

38:32.915 --> 38:34.816
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

38:34.884 --> 38:37.752
No. You're gonna
love this bit, trust me.

38:39.822 --> 38:41.256
Ta-da!

38:43.526 --> 38:45.527
Dad?

38:45.594 --> 38:46.995
Oh, my God.

38:56.010 --> 38:58.578
Is this for real?

38:58.646 --> 39:01.348
It's real, baby girl.
It's real.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.054
So she doctored
the muffins to keep you

39:08.122 --> 39:10.990
talking
to the trees, mate.

39:11.058 --> 39:18.264
Each visit another batch
of magic muffins, right?

39:18.332 --> 39:20.533
Why would I do that?

39:20.601 --> 39:25.038
Wayne's half of the
estate for starters.

39:25.106 --> 39:29.008
It's more than that,
though, isn't it?

39:29.076 --> 39:31.678
You hurt
a little girl.

39:31.746 --> 39:32.912
That's where
I come in because

39:32.980 --> 39:37.317
I take that very, very personally.

39:37.385 --> 39:39.986
Why did you do this to me, Gina?

39:40.054 --> 39:43.356
The lifeblood of the
estate are the horses.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.725
I'm the one that
takes care of them.

39:45.793 --> 39:48.027
Wayne's never
understood them.

39:48.095 --> 39:50.897
Right.

39:50.965 --> 39:58.471
So you drugged Wayne to keep him
away from the horses, right?

39:58.539 --> 40:01.775
He ends up almost killing
himself and his daughter.

40:01.842 --> 40:09.115
They they drag him off to the
finger-painting academy for life.

40:09.183 --> 40:10.984
Problem solved?

40:18.559 --> 40:20.293
Here.

40:20.361 --> 40:21.428
Cor. What's
that smell?

40:21.495 --> 40:22.495
What smell?

40:22.563 --> 40:24.164
Must be the ferry
going by.

40:24.231 --> 40:26.699
What?
Nothing.

40:28.502 --> 40:30.320
You know, we've been
together all day,

40:30.404 --> 40:34.274
and you haven't mentioned
being in the hospital once.

40:34.341 --> 40:37.377
So tell me
what happened.

40:40.448 --> 40:43.516
I nicked one
of Amanda's muffins.

40:43.584 --> 40:44.851
Why would you do that?

40:44.919 --> 40:46.853
Well, because it was just
sitting there, you know,

40:46.921 --> 40:49.255
looking all tasty.

40:49.323 --> 40:52.192
You deliberately got yourself
admitted, didn't you?

40:52.259 --> 40:53.726
Says who?

40:53.794 --> 40:56.196
I do, and I'm mad.

40:56.263 --> 40:58.231
I know.

40:58.299 --> 41:04.270
All right. Look. If I had
deliberately admitted myself, right,

41:04.338 --> 41:08.041
that would make me completely
bloody bonkers, wouldn't it?

41:08.108 --> 41:09.843
So is that what
you think?

41:11.712 --> 41:16.883
Yeah. I saw your grandma
because of that muffin.

41:16.951 --> 41:18.485
And?

41:18.552 --> 41:22.589
And you know how
this started out

41:22.656 --> 41:24.724
me trying to
help Amanda?

41:24.792 --> 41:29.462
Well, I think it was her that
really did me the favor, you know?

41:29.530 --> 41:34.167
Well, did you
and your mom talk?

41:34.235 --> 41:36.302
You think I got a screw
loose, don't you?

41:36.370 --> 41:38.771
You talked.
Yeah.

41:38.839 --> 41:42.575
She wanted to know if
you were like her.

41:42.643 --> 41:45.311
Well, am I?

41:45.379 --> 41:49.098
I hope so.
A little bit.

41:52.586 --> 41:54.988
So do you think it was
really her talking to you

41:55.055 --> 41:59.092
or just you talking
to yourself?

41:59.159 --> 42:01.794
Have you been psychobabbling
with Gillian again?

42:01.862 --> 42:05.665
Well, my dad's a lunatic.
Ground me.

42:05.733 --> 42:07.834
I bet she said a couple
days in that place

42:07.902 --> 42:09.402
was just what
I needed, right?

42:09.470 --> 42:10.603
Just a couple?

42:10.671 --> 42:12.372
Oi. Enough
of your lip.

42:12.439 --> 42:15.041
So, um, did you see
anyone else in there?

42:15.109 --> 42:16.476
Like who?

42:16.544 --> 42:18.244
That's a no then.

42:18.312 --> 42:23.149
Yes. I'll tell
you what.

42:23.217 --> 42:26.452
Loker got completely
off his nut.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.587
That was something
to see.

42:27.655 --> 42:29.389
I got it on disk.

42:29.456 --> 42:31.558
A true compliment
coming from you.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.662
Happy Birthday, dad.

42:35.729 --> 42:37.664
I can't hear you.

42:40.134 --> 42:43.069
Burnt. My favorite.
