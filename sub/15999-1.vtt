00:31.614 --> 00:33.799
The summer wind

00:34.150 --> 00:36.301
Came blowing in

00:36.653 --> 00:40.013
From across the sea

00:42.625 --> 00:44.893
It lingered there

00:45.211 --> 00:47.938
To touch your hair

00:48.089 --> 00:50.899
And walk with me

00:53.303 --> 00:55.195
All summer long

00:55.722 --> 00:57.739
We sang a song

00:58.349 --> 01:02.911
And then we strolled that golden sand

01:06.024 --> 01:08.000
Two sweethearts

01:09.277 --> 01:12.357
And the summer wind

01:15.658 --> 01:18.468
Like painted kites

01:18.620 --> 01:20.762
Those days and nights

01:20.914 --> 01:24.016
They went flying by

01:27.045 --> 01:29.855
The world was new

01:30.006 --> 01:35.819
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

01:38.389 --> 01:43.243
Then softer than a piper man

01:43.394 --> 01:47.873
One day it called to you

01:50.401 --> 01:53.337
I lost you

01:54.155 --> 01:57.299
I lost you to the summer wind

02:00.703 --> 02:03.055
The autumn wind

02:03.206 --> 02:05.432
And the winter winds

02:05.583 --> 02:07.893
They have come and gone

02:11.756 --> 02:14.024
And still the days

02:14.175 --> 02:17.152
Those lonely days they go...

02:17.303 --> 02:20.197
Hi, Charlie. It's 3:30.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.742
I'm taking Beth's 4:00 class
'cause she's got an audition.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.702
Sorry I won't be able
to make your dinner.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.330
Hey, do me a favor, don't cook.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.623
- Jesus.
- Be good.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.709
That never end

02:35.613 --> 02:38.799
My fickle friend

02:39.659 --> 02:47.266
The summer wind

02:49.377 --> 02:52.729
Warm summer wind

02:59.470 --> 03:02.614
Where the hell you been? Frankie.

03:10.815 --> 03:14.042
How come nobody keeps me waiting
when they're looking to borrow it?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.212
- You don't want it? You don't want it?
- Gimme the money. Gimme the money.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.468
- We gotta stop meeting like this.
- Gimme the money!

03:26.915 --> 03:28.724
Yeah, grazie.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.477
- Ronnie, I'm sorry.
- Paulie came in late, too.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.439
- Paulie came in late?
- So I been working short a waiter.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.150
Charlie, he's your cousin,
but the kid pushes it to the hilt.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.943
Hey, tell me about it.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.070
I been on the phone
with reservations half the day.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.407
Christ, don't people know
how bad the food is here?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.618
Ladies' room toilet
overflowed during lunch.

03:48.811 --> 03:53.373
To top it off, the old man's upstairs.
He's got a bug up his ass this big.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.126
- Claims he's being robbed blind.
- What else is new?

03:56.277 --> 03:59.338
He's not bullshitting, Charlie.
He's checking the waiters' dupes.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.591
He's checking the dupes tonight?
You tell Paulie?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.427
I already told Paulie.
The party is over for a while.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.430
And you're the guy on the line with him.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.352
Has Nicky been in yet?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.437
He's late,
like everybody else around here.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.607
Oh, and the machine's been
out of Marlboros for a week now.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.360
And J3 on the jukebox sticks.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.077
Charlie, this bimbo broad
you're getting started with,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.662
this is Johnny Mack's private stock.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.124
Who's getting started?
Huh? What am I doing?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.045
What did I do?

04:54.752 --> 04:57.020
Is Paulie here?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.202
Will you give me a break,
for Christ's sake?

05:12.353 --> 05:14.162
I'm coming, I'm coming.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.956
Hey, Paulie, now. Come on.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.249
You got it.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.838
That's good, Charlie.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.007
The house had some nice week here.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.845
$195. What do you want for yourself?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.932
- Let me grab 15 for cab fare.
- You got it.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.476
Paulie make his payment?

05:37.670 --> 05:38.770
Paulie who?

05:39.589 --> 05:42.732
Anything I can get for you?
My name is Paulie.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.694
If you need anything,
you will call me, yes? Absolutely.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.779
Hey, Frankie, what number came in today?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.614
Brooklyn number? 417.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.492
- What'd you have? 325?
- No, I had 417.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.870
- Not with me, you didn't.
- 325.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.330
- You got it.
- Billy.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.170
Walter, any time on table six.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.095
You okay with your Shylocks out there?
I got a few, if you need it, man.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.890
Ronnie warn you about the old man?
Paulie, it's serious.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.521
Cut that out, you Argentine degenerate.
That's my cousin's ass you're rubbing.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.981
That's family.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.150
This ain't some filthy little jail
in Caracas.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.402
It's Amer-ii-ca!

06:30.765 --> 06:32.657
Where the hell are my clams?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.619
We get some fucking plates?! Come on!

06:41.901 --> 06:44.628
Keep quiet. Shut up. Just eat, huh?

06:44.779 --> 06:47.172
Patty, enjoy the scarol'. Vito, dig in.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.050
Everything is taken care of.
Alla salute.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.220
- Salut'.
- Salut'.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.682
You like the steak?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.938
Who's got the big table?

07:03.131 --> 07:06.066
- Maybe Paulie.
- Maybe Paulie.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.197
- Walter's half whacked.
- Walter the cook?

07:13.307 --> 07:15.492
Walter the cook.
You know another Walter in the place?

07:15.643 --> 07:17.619
Somebody's been feeding him vodka.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.454
Hey, now what's wrong with this, Paulie?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.998
He ordered Beefeater. Says it ain't.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.168
Nobody would do that, Charlie.
Who'd give that boozer a drink?

07:25.319 --> 07:29.965
All the waiters know better. Of course,
I can't vouch for the busboys.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.217
The big party on table eight?

07:33.035 --> 07:35.679
- Let me see the check.
- I got their ticket, man.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.472
- Let me see the check.
- What for?

07:37.623 --> 07:39.599
'Cause you're running a contract
at that table, that's what for,

07:39.750 --> 07:41.268
and half the dishes aren't on the check.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.895
No? We'll borrow
a thousand apiece from Frankie Shy

07:44.046 --> 07:45.188
and bet it on the check.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.732
If you got more than six entrees
on it, you win.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.528
I count, uh... I count 12 entrees...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.822
I count 12 entrees on that table,
three of them steaks.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.949
Paulie, I'll go you double or nothing

07:56.100 --> 07:58.326
whether you got a single fucking
steak on that check.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.745
Careful on that double
or nothing, Charlie.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.831
You'll lose your ass on that bet.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.208
Gimme the book.

08:05.401 --> 08:08.044
Hey, Charlie, you were in.
Hey, man, I'm serious.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.088
You were in for a ten-spot.
Serious, you were in...

08:10.239 --> 08:12.132
Six entrees. Six entrees, huh?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.509
- You're a greedy bastard, know that?
- Charlie...

08:14.660 --> 08:16.845
You're a greedy bastard.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.389
I had you figured for a sawbuck.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.765
You had me figured for a sawbuck.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.809
For what, to tide me over
when the old man fires me?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.770
Relax. That old asshole
won't know a thing.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.274
Plus you're feeding the cook vodka
to get your food out without dupes.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.861
Another hour, he's gonna go face-ass
down into a bowl of scaloppini.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.197
I'm gonna have to go behind
the range, blow another $80 shirt.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.951
I mean, at least that oughta be enough
so you stop screwing me.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.162
Screwing you?

08:43.731 --> 08:47.876
I wasn't screwing you, Charlie.
I had you figured for a sawbuck.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.129
Hey, I don't want a sawbuck, all right?
I want my job.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.007
Cousin or no cousin,
that's the last check you rob, capisce?

08:54.158 --> 08:56.259
- Capisce. I understand.
- You understand me? I'm serious now.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.553
Do you understand me? I'm serious now.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.806
- Fix your tie.
- What?

09:01.958 --> 09:05.226
Fix your tie.
You're such a fucking slob.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.772
- This good?
- Go.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.735
Do you have my charge tips?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.695
No, I'm not done yet, Waldo.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.365
Mr. Owner would like to see you
after you check out.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.126
And you, you little prick...

09:26.226 --> 09:27.832
You stole my clams.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.671
Hey, Paulie, don't play with him.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.766
We're not getting rich
in this place, Charlie.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.396
You'll never get your own
joint like this, never.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.947
I mean it, man.
We're breaking our ass for nickels...

09:59.098 --> 10:01.866
Hey, Paulie, will you give me a break
and let me check out, please?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.079
Good night, Charles.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.457
Charles?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.379
Charles.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.553
- I'm out. I'm on the street.
- He fired you?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.680
No, he fired us.
They nailed you on that big check.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.434
He should die.
Die! Die, you old bastard!

10:27.585 --> 10:30.520
No, you're the one that should die.
Ronnie told you it was my job.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.939
Charlie. Hey, man.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.316
Hey, man, don't blame me for what
that old bastard done to you.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.068
He fired you, man, him!

10:37.261 --> 10:38.862
- Hey, let me out of here, all right?
- Charlie!

10:39.013 --> 10:40.447
We were starving in that shithouse.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.574
Hey, why don't you grow up,
for Christ's sakes, huh?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.617
Why don't you just fucking grow up?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.619
- Charlie.
- Charlie. What?

10:46.771 --> 10:50.915
We were like a couple of victims in
there. You know, we could do better.

10:51.067 --> 10:55.670
We could do a thousand percent better.
Hey, man, don't think so small.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.631
For once in your life,
don't worry about a lousy job, okay?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.592
Don't worry about a job?
Don't worry about...

11:00.743 --> 11:02.177
What the fuck should I worry about, huh?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.221
I owe six different department stores,
I got two Shylocks I gotta feed...

11:05.414 --> 11:07.891
I got Shylocks, too.
You ain't alone here.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.018
And those other assholes, the stores?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.438
You got no job now.
They can't collect no money off you.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.482
Why can't you just admit
you was wrong, huh?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.817
Why can't you just say,
"Charlie, I was wrong"?

11:17.968 --> 11:19.903
- Wrong?
- Yeah, wrong.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.113
Where was I wrong?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.657
What did you say?

11:24.809 --> 11:27.243
- I said where was I wrong?
- Where was you wrong?

11:27.395 --> 11:31.164
Ronnie told you not to rob.
You robbed. That got me fired.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.083
You was wrong. You understand that?
You were wrong. You understand that?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.960
- I didn't figure I'd get caught.
- You didn't figure...

11:36.112 --> 11:39.464
Look, man, if I figured I'd get caught,
I'd be a thousand percent wrong.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.760
But if I didn't figure I'd get caught,
then I wasn't jeopardizing your job.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.595
Hey, don't you understand, Charlie...

11:48.374 --> 11:50.850
- Hey!
- Keep your hands off me.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.354
- Look what you did to my suit.
- I'm sorry.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.314
What do you need
a fancy suit for, Charlie?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.650
You got no job to wear it to, man.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.944
- What did you say?
- Come on.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.238
Huh? Say that again.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.657
Say it again. Say it again.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.785
Say... say what you just said again.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.663
About my suit.
Say... say... what do I don't need?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.456
Tell me what I don't need.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.167
What do you need
a fancy suit for, Charlie?

12:16.318 --> 12:18.753
You got no job to wear it to, man.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.674
That's right.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.008
Why?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.472
Here's your button.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.683
Come on, man.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.061
Hey, man, let's go watch the sun
come up like the old days.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.605
Hey, Charluccio!

12:37.757 --> 12:41.401
We'll sit and have a couple
of cognacs like gentlemen!

12:43.554 --> 12:46.281
Hey, let me tell you something.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.952
I don't have time to sit
and watch the sun come up.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.080
Capisce? I don't have time.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.231
I could teach another aerobics class.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.152
There's some models
trying out for a commercial.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.488
It would mean a few
extra dollars next week.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.577
Great. Oh, Wallach's wants 300.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.288
Or they're gonna give it
to a collection agency.

13:36.398 --> 13:40.335
We can cut back a little, too.
We eat out a lot more than we have to.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.048
- You gonna cook?
- I can cook.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.009
You can cook. You can't cook.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.187
I don't fucking believe this.
I don't... I don't believe this.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.565
She's got 11 months'
worth of parking tickets here.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.234
- The fucking bitch.
- Who?

14:05.386 --> 14:09.072
Who? Cooky. Who else? Cooky.
She's still got the Buick in my name.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.282
God damn it.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.369
Let her pay them. It's only fair.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.165
How can you say "Let her pay"?
Every penny that she gets comes from me.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.794
Jesus Christ! It's almost two grand.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.713
She must be parking
on the fucking sidewalk.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.092
- Take the car back.
- Take the car back.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.718
She got three brothers
who belong in a zoo.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.720
I take the car back,
they'll start a war over that thing.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.598
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'll manage.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.976
So what are you talking about then?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.229
Why you being such a cooze, huh?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.237
Was that an accident?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.656
Huh? Was that an accident?

14:51.807 --> 14:54.701
- I don't think so.
- Jesus Christ.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.205
Why did you do that?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.258
I'm sorry.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.137
You can hit.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.350
Finding a job will pick you up.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.061
You'll get your reflexes back.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.810
I think I already got my reflexes back.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.373
The summer wind

15:42.524 --> 15:45.043
Came blowing in

15:45.194 --> 15:47.879
From across the sea

15:50.699 --> 15:53.134
It lingered there

15:53.285 --> 15:56.095
To touch your hair

15:56.246 --> 15:59.432
And walk with me

16:01.418 --> 16:03.686
All summer long

16:04.004 --> 16:06.189
We sang a song

16:06.674 --> 16:12.570
And then we strolled that golden sand

16:14.181 --> 16:16.949
Two sweethearts

16:17.351 --> 16:20.870
And the summer wind

16:24.316 --> 16:26.501
Like painted kites

16:26.652 --> 16:28.920
Those days and nights

16:29.113 --> 16:32.006
They went flying by

16:35.077 --> 16:38.054
The world was new

16:38.205 --> 16:43.976
Beneath a blue umbrella sky...

16:44.128 --> 16:46.229
Hey, Charlie Moran.
How the hell are you, huh?

16:46.380 --> 16:49.190
- How you doing?
- What's happening, baby?

16:50.467 --> 16:53.778
- I'm not doing any good in there.
- You know anybody who does?

16:53.971 --> 16:57.198
- So what's happening? How's Cooky?
- Cooky's history.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.743
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.371
So, what's happening with you?
What are you doing?

17:03.731 --> 17:05.873
- Waiting.
- You're waiting? For what?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.583
Work.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.335
Charlie, I'm not gonna
bullshit with you now.

17:09.486 --> 17:13.422
I swear to God, business is off with me.
I'm down 35% on my dinners.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.883
You're up against a wall,
you come in by me,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.885
I put you out on the floor
a couple of shifts a week.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.054
You work as a waiter, okay?

17:20.204 --> 17:21.848
- Work as a waiter?
- Yeah.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.184
- I look like a waiter to you, huh?
- No. I'm offering you a job.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.603
- You want to put me on as a waiter?
- Gonna get mad at me over this?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.564
- I offer you a job...
- I wouldn't work in your restaurant...

17:29.715 --> 17:31.524
- Do me a favor. Go fuck yourself, okay?
- Hey.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.029
Fucking creep, you!

17:40.184 --> 17:43.953
Maybe you should take a waiter's job
until something better opens up.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.830
Diane, give me a break, huh?

17:47.649 --> 17:49.125
Just a thought.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.711
What do you want me to do,
you want me to save up

17:51.862 --> 17:53.171
my little tip cup every night?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.090
In 20 years, maybe I'll have
enough to own a place?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.134
It's honest work, Charlie.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.555
Something I learned a long time ago
about honest work.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.225
When people tell you they got
honest work for you, know what they got?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.561
- What?
- A shit job. That's what they got.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.105
Do you ever think
we don't have to own the restaurant

18:11.256 --> 18:12.648
to move to the country, Charlie?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.943
You could find a job managing a place.
I could get work.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.155
Diane, I'm not gonna head up to Maine,
you know, start chopping wood.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.117
When we leave the city,
I'm gonna leave as an owner.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.161
How are you gonna see your son
when you leave?

18:25.312 --> 18:28.664
- You think about it?
- I'll work it out.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.250
What's the sudden interest in my kid?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.212
It's not sudden.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.006
I'm curious.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.050
Doesn't it bother you
to only see Vinnie once a week?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.260
Yeah, it bothers me. Yeah.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.804
It bothers me.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.849
When Cooky and I first split up,
I used to see the kid every other day.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.852
I used to take him to the zoo.
I took him to the ferry.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.188
I dropped money
at every Carvel stand in the city.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.814
- And?
- And what?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.902
Then Cooky and her scumbag brothers
used to knock me down all week long.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.820
Bang, bang, bang. No mercy.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.405
So by the time I got the kid,

19:01.557 --> 19:04.784
I got nothing but tight lips
and a frown all day.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.207
It might be different if it was our kid.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.758
Not at this point in my life.
I mean, you know.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.970
You know, maybe down the road sometime.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.721
But not right now.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.684
Why not right now?

19:29.835 --> 19:33.271
Because I got my back
against the wall right now, that's why.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.855
I got no job right now.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.482
You want me to put it
a different way for you?

19:36.633 --> 19:39.318
I'm outta work right now.
I got no money, capisce?

19:39.469 --> 19:42.363
I got two Shylocks
I gotta carry on my back.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.991
I got a marshal who wants
to put a lien on my salary

19:45.142 --> 19:47.243
when and if I get a salary, all right?

19:47.394 --> 19:50.329
I got an ex-wife and I got a kid
I gotta feed every week.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.582
Listen to you, Charlie.
You're always saying "I." "I got two..."

19:53.734 --> 19:56.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, Diane!
Don't play games with me, all right?

19:56.486 --> 19:59.338
- I'm not playing games with you.
- What do you wanna do, you wanna fight?

19:59.489 --> 20:03.509
- Shut up, damn it! Fuck off! Piss off!
- Hey! What do you wanna do?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.971
Look, I'm going to go bang
around the Village for a while, right?

20:07.956 --> 20:11.559
I need a dose of sanity in my life.
Yeah, hey.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.854
Charlie?

20:15.797 --> 20:18.065
- Charlie!
- What? What do you want?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.402
What do you want?
What? What do you want?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.031
What? What do you want?
Speak. What do you want?

20:26.266 --> 20:28.409
- I'm pregnant.
- Come over here.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.912
Come over here. Come over here.

20:33.106 --> 20:38.044
Come over here.
Come over here right now.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.880
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't come over here.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.798
Don't come over here.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.315
Grandpa used to have hundreds of birds

20:59.466 --> 21:01.192
he used to keep up here on the roof.

21:01.468 --> 21:06.113
He had all different kinds.
He had tipplets. He had flights.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.909
He had tumblers. He had nuns.
You know what nuns are?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.203
They're pigeons.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.789
One of the most beautiful flocks
in the whole Village

21:14.940 --> 21:16.957
was up here in this coop.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.126
They used to have pigeon wars
over these birds.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.920
Grandpa used to stand up here
with a stick.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.464
He used to go like this.
He used to bring all the birds home.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.342
Hey, Vinnie,
most of your grandfather's time up here

21:26.493 --> 21:29.595
was spent cleaning up bird shit, it was.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.773
Hey, Vinnie,
tell your old man to listen.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.401
Cousin Paulie's got something cooking.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.028
He's gonna thank me for getting us out
of that sentence

21:46.179 --> 21:47.738
we were serving at Sal's.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.199
- Hey, I wanna find my own job alone.
- Job?

21:50.809 --> 21:54.870
Job? Who's talking about a job?
I'm talking about a move, man.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.122
I'll pass.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.791
How can he pass on something
he don't even hear, Vinnie?

21:58.942 --> 22:01.252
I don't know.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.630
This is a score, man. Nice and easy.

22:04.781 --> 22:08.801
And the guy I'm in with is a pro,
Charlie. An absolute pro, man.

22:08.952 --> 22:13.764
Yeah? Well, you're an amateur, like me.
We're not professional thieves, Paulie.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.521
Where you been?
I'm waiting a God damn an hour.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.857
- I gotta go shopping.
- Cooky, don't bust my balls, all right?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.609
Come on, honey.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.028
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, Dad.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.534
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
- Come on, honey.

22:41.818 --> 22:45.504
She'll have you paying taxes
if you're not careful, man.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.508
They're all the same.
They like you to think small, you know?

22:49.659 --> 22:53.053
Paulie, a couple of weeks out of work,
you're gonna start thinking small, too.

22:53.205 --> 22:58.267
Tips, pay, plus what you robbed,
you were bringing home 600 a week.

22:58.418 --> 23:02.646
Where you gonna find that, huh?
Where you gonna find that, huh?

23:02.798 --> 23:04.982
You take a girl out, you drop 100 bucks.

23:05.133 --> 23:09.111
Hey, more than 100, Charlie.
I mean, I like to look good, you know?

23:09.262 --> 23:12.239
Lobsters, some wine,
a couple of sambucas, you know?

23:12.432 --> 23:15.284
When I drop 100 on my night off,
I figure I got away cheap,

23:15.435 --> 23:16.660
you know, like I robbed 50.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.580
Soon money ain't gonna be
no problem, Charlie.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.792
- I got something big going for me, man.
- Oh, yeah? What?

23:23.944 --> 23:26.545
I own a piece of a thoroughbred.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.173
- A what?
- A thoroughbred.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.426
A fucking racehorse, Charlie.

23:32.577 --> 23:35.304
I'm in with Tommy Botondo
and Jimmy the Cheese Man.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.432
Five thou apiece we went for.

23:38.583 --> 23:42.061
- Where did you get 5,000?
- I went on the street for it.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.312
- On the street?
- Yeah.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.106
- What are you, stunat?
- Hey, man, we got a score set up.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.692
If you would listen,
money ain't gonna be no problem.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.321
Paulie, what do you or Jimmy
the Cheese Man know about horses?

23:52.472 --> 23:54.573
I don't have to know nothing
in this deal.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.742
I got in on a swindle with this horse.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.454
This horse's father won
the Belmont Stakes, man.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.917
Any horse wins the Belmont Stakes,
the yearlings go for maybe 600 big ones.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.420
That's exactly it.
We got her for 15 grand, man.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.465
It was like shoplifting,
buying this horse.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.760
Have you ever heard
of artificial inspiration?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.680
It don't just work with people, Charlie.

24:17.831 --> 24:22.059
See, horses can have babies
by artificial inspiration, too, man.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.937
Like, let's say you got
a couple of horses

24:25.130 --> 24:28.190
worth... a million dollars apiece.

24:28.341 --> 24:31.151
You don't wanna set 'em loose
in some field to screw.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.947
I mean, how many times you yourself
pull a muscle or something screwing?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.866
And these great big stallions,
man, they get horny,

24:38.018 --> 24:40.536
they could easily kick
the mother horse in the head.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.373
- Ba-boom. You're out a million dollars.
- So what's the point?

24:44.524 --> 24:46.125
- Point?
- Yeah, what's the point?

24:46.276 --> 24:51.005
Jimmy the Cheese Man got in
with the groom of this champion horse.

24:52.115 --> 24:55.009
We got some of this champion's jism.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.595
The groom jerked the horse off.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.556
He beat his meat right in the stable.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.517
Well, my horse's mother got some of it.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.020
You bet horses.
You know what that means.

25:06.171 --> 25:11.066
Her first race, Starry Hope
goes off at big, big odds, man.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.486
Her papers say her father
was some no-dick piece of garbage,

25:14.638 --> 25:17.906
but she got the champion gene, Charlie.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.369
- Champion gene?
- Yeah.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.080
Horses ain't like people, man.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.708
They can't make themselves better
than they're born.

25:27.859 --> 25:31.420
See, with a horse, it's all in the gene.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.798
It's the fucking gene
that does the running.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.468
The horse got absolutely nothing
to do with it.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.637
Let me ask you something.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.264
I mean, how the hell are you
gonna make your Shylock payments?

25:42.415 --> 25:45.392
- Now, especially?
- Exactly like I told you, man.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.605
With the nicest,
easiest score you ever heard of.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.232
Charlie, at least meet the guy, okay?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.318
You got nothing to lose
by looking it over.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.530
There's a real deadline on this,
Charlucc'.

25:58.682 --> 26:03.786
Starry Hope runs in a couple of weeks,
and I need big bucks to bet with, man.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.456
There's real money to be made
on that race, you know?

26:12.487 --> 26:14.046
You know, you ought to get a permit.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.006
A permit? For what?

26:16.157 --> 26:19.718
To shit in the street.
You look like a horse.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.904
Paulie,
are you sure this guy is all right?

27:09.711 --> 27:11.770
That's Barney.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.522
What are you doing?

27:14.841 --> 27:17.317
I fix clocks here in the Bronx.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.446
Antique dealers downtown feed me work.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.781
Chimes, mostly.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.409
You can make a good living in this city
doing nothing but chimes.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.660
Chimes, man.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.662
Yeah, chimes. I get it.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.625
Can you still open safes?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.085
Some.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.380
The kind we'll run into
on this job I can get into.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.216
Yeah? What kind can't you get into?

27:44.037 --> 27:46.054
- What kind?
- Yeah.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.058
Banks. Big jewelry houses.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.936
Anything wired up to Holmes.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.981
I'm not a big-time safecracker.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.900
I'm a hotshot locksmith.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.611
People got a half million to protect,

28:00.762 --> 28:03.322
they buy the kind of box
I don't know how to get into.

28:04.224 --> 28:08.035
- Are you sure about opening this one?
- If it ain't wired, I can get into it.

28:08.186 --> 28:12.456
- Your buddy boy says it ain't wired.
- Guaranteed. I seen it, man.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.877
You done any time, Barney?

28:20.156 --> 28:21.882
Goes back to '47.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.551
I did a pound at Green Haven.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.931
Hey, what the fuck is this, huh?
What the fuck is this?

28:30.792 --> 28:34.394
We giving lifetime references here?
I did five years in the joint.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.064
Five years. End of story, huh?

28:38.091 --> 28:39.775
'47, Charlie.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.195
Either of you guys have
an automobile out there?

28:44.347 --> 28:45.823
- Yeah.
- Better hurry.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.742
The summons man is blitzing the street
with his little fleet of tow trucks.

28:48.935 --> 28:51.161
Tow trucks! Shit!

28:53.440 --> 28:57.292
He's the only police officer in this
city that sets the hook himself.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.672
Hey! It's my car. It's my car.

29:02.657 --> 29:05.717
- Hey, I'll move it, Officer.
- Lift her.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.636
Hey! That ain't right,
and you know it, man!

29:09.372 --> 29:13.976
Hey, Officer, I get here before you
hook me, you're supposed to let me go.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.937
I still gotta take a ticket,
but you're not supposed to tow me.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.522
Take it away!

29:25.972 --> 29:27.990
Cocksucker.

29:37.650 --> 29:41.003
That rat bastard
was supposed to let me go.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.046
He doesn't let anyone go.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.757
He hooked Monsignor Ryan's
Coupe de Ville last Saturday

29:45.909 --> 29:48.218
while the Monsignor was in saying
the 8:00 mass.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.553
The man is possessed.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.764
He should die of hemorrhoids.

29:52.916 --> 29:56.602
It's gonna cost you $100 for the tow,
plus $25 for the ticket.

29:56.753 --> 30:00.105
And that fat bastard comes in here
every afternoon like clockwork

30:00.256 --> 30:03.692
to piss in my toilet
and drink my whisky free.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.325
He knows there's two
first-class locks on that building.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.118
Take me an hour to go through them.

30:13.269 --> 30:16.455
The other one,
I go through with a toothpick.

30:16.606 --> 30:20.083
Crossing that alley to the other roof
is a piece of cake.

30:20.235 --> 30:24.212
We go inside, I open the safe
and we find peanuts in there,

30:24.364 --> 30:25.756
I'm gonna want your ass, Paulie.

30:25.907 --> 30:29.176
Charlie, this is A1,
guaran-fucking-teed, man.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.303
Go ahead and sleep on it.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.723
Paulie, before I go to sleep on it,
just how sure are you of the 50 thou?

30:34.874 --> 30:37.517
They deliver to some kind
of small chemical plant, COD.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.521
Payment in green.
And there's 15 trucks out there.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.815
- And it all goes in the safe?
- Every penny.

30:43.967 --> 30:47.527
They get back too late for the banks.
Friday's receipts sit over the weekend.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.614
Charlie, we've been through this
again and again.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.159
What is he, stunat'?

30:55.144 --> 30:56.662
What do you mean?

30:56.813 --> 30:58.288
He's like a wackadoo.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.832
Noodles and an egg roll. How much?

31:00.984 --> 31:03.168
Hey, what's the matter with you, Barney?

31:03.319 --> 31:05.754
Hey, man,
you'll die if you eat that shit.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.256
This guy is selling
instant hepatitis here.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.384
It ain't nothing but warm germs
going here.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.929
Charlie, we're gonna
lose our partner here, man.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.891
This upazz' bought a horse.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.310
What's your story?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.523
Come here, Charlie.

31:28.011 --> 31:32.864
With these eyes, four more years,
they're gonna tell me to buy a shepherd.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.574
I'm 58.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.161
I got a 25-year-old retarded kid
my wife won't let go of.

31:39.022 --> 31:43.166
I've a two-family house,
a little left on the mortgage.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.712
I might see some extra bucks every month
if the neighborhood don't go colored.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.463
Colored, man.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.551
I need one nice score now so the kid's
got something going for him.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.053
- One nice score.
- Right.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.513
Absolutely.

31:57.790 --> 32:02.436
Hey, Paulie, where the hell you
gonna keep that horse you bought?

32:02.587 --> 32:06.148
- I thought you live on Carmine Street.
- At the racetrack, for Christ's sake.

32:06.299 --> 32:10.652
It ain't a fucking pet, Barney.
It's a racehorse, okay? Huh.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.198
Hey, either one of you do any time?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.034
- What, are you nuts?!
- Hey, Barney, whoa.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.703
Do I look like I could afford
to do any time?

32:19.854 --> 32:21.204
I'm no tough guy.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.123
They send me upstate,
some big militant begunda's

32:23.316 --> 32:25.709
gonna grab me in the shower
and "ram it up yo' ass!"

32:25.860 --> 32:28.295
- Fuck that shit.
- It's no joke.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.547
All this talk about doing time
makes me nervous.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.760
Are you in, Charlie, or what?

32:38.164 --> 32:40.348
Is there gonna be money in that safe?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.810
Yes, man. For the tenth time, yes.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.187
Barney, don't eat this shit.
Give me this.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.191
- Hey, come on. Stop. What the fuck?
- It ain't good for you, Barney.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.193
I paid two bucks for it!
Gimme the two bucks!

33:04.107 --> 33:05.624
- Hey, Bunky.
- Hey, Nunzi.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.585
Who's the guys?

33:09.612 --> 33:12.422
The Chinks? They're okay.
They're with Eddie.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.468
- How's the calamari?
- Mm.

33:21.207 --> 33:25.185
Hey, Bunky, the fight next week,
you still got a hook-up for tickets?

33:25.336 --> 33:26.895
Yeah, but let me know how many.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.563
Tomorrow, I'll give you a call.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.026
Will you give me a break
with that smoke?

33:40.685 --> 33:42.702
What's the matter? No scungilli tonight?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.913
My stomach's a little sour.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.415
I wanna eat bland for a while.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.671
You could have a wire that big
underneath all that sauce.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.632
You're the cop.
You're supposed to be wired, not me.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.760
No more, Eddie.
Don't you read the newspapers?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.847
All the cops are getting pinched now.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.100
Wise guys, they're too busy testifying.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.434
You're right.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.271
Yeah, everything
is upside down out there.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.273
The whole world is upside down.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.444
Listen, uh...

34:16.596 --> 34:19.239
I hear you're having a little trouble
with Carlucci.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.617
Put something in your mouth, Bunky.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.328
It's good.

34:36.114 --> 34:38.800
The brass, they're getting
a little nervous, you understand?

34:40.786 --> 34:43.388
We're sweetening up the pot this month.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.806
You keep everybody calm.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.351
There'll be 150 large there.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.188
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.565
That's all that counts. No?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.025
You're right.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.196
I remember you. You're the guy...

35:41.347 --> 35:43.365
Yeah, I'm the guy
who got his car fucking towed.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.116
- And you're Jinty, right?
- Ginty.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.577
- That's what I said.
- What the hell are you doing?

35:47.770 --> 35:51.414
Don't worry about it, Gint. Here.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.416
Put that in your cup.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.419
Please God,
you're not poisoning the man, are you?

35:56.571 --> 35:57.921
It ain't poison.

35:58.239 --> 36:01.299
It's horse physic.
Hey, pour the ginger ale, man.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.511
It's what they give horses
when they can't shit.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.054
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.348
How many of those little envelopes
do they give to a horse that can't shit?

36:08.499 --> 36:13.478
One. One envelope will bust
a block of concrete, man.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.689
Take a long time to work?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.190
It ain't slow.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.251
Encore.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.770
Yeah. 1013.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.773
Uh, Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.819
There's an officer down.
Officer needs assistance here.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.114
Hurry, man, hurry. Yeah.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.410
Cop shit in his pants!

37:52.561 --> 37:55.997
Cop shit his pants! Shit his pants!

37:56.148 --> 37:58.583
Whoo! Yeah!

37:58.734 --> 38:00.627
Cop shit his pants!

38:03.572 --> 38:07.217
Cop shit his pants! Cop shit his pants!

38:09.203 --> 38:12.639
He's a cop. He's a cop.
He's a cop. He shit his pants.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.141
The cop shit his pants!

38:40.276 --> 38:41.418
It's nice.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.295
It's slightly run-down
and needs a little paint.

38:52.830 --> 38:57.725
It's nice.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.021
It's old. I like that.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.570
- Hello. How are you?
- I'll be with you in a moment.

39:12.641 --> 39:15.952
Needs a buffing machine in the kitchen.
That's the first thing I'd do.

39:16.854 --> 39:20.039
You've painted it
and taken care of the silverware.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.460
Now all we need's a way to buy it.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.089
It's still for sale.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.760
Charlie, you've stopped
even looking for a job.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.515
Listen, uh... after next week,
I might make a real score.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.226
I might not need a job.

39:42.004 --> 39:44.022
Is Paulie part of it?

39:45.716 --> 39:47.692
No.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.653
- Really?
- Yeah, Paulie's part of it.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.741
Hi. Uh, I hope you're not here
to see Linwood.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.451
- He's gone for the day.
- He's not here?

39:57.978 --> 39:59.621
No, we just came up to have lunch.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.540
Would you tell Linwood
that we stopped by?

40:02.691 --> 40:05.460
Mm-hm. Beaujolais?

40:05.611 --> 40:07.212
Beaujolais. Beaujolais?

40:07.363 --> 40:10.089
- Yes.
- Beaujolais. A full bottle.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.178
He's just got you fired.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.639
Maybe he's trying to make it up to me.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.228
When are you gonna outgrow him, Charlie?

40:23.504 --> 40:25.438
Outgrow him?

40:29.385 --> 40:31.194
Diane, maybe WASPs outgrow people.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.155
Italians, they outgrow clothes,
not people.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.866
Hey, Nicky tells me you bought a horse.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.576
- Who Nicky?
- Nicky the Nose.

40:38.727 --> 40:39.994
He says you bought a racehorse.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.580
Well, not a whole horse, Pop.
There's three of us.

40:42.731 --> 40:46.084
Now, look, listen, Paulie.
You're 28 years old.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.254
Your mother's not doing you no favor
by bringing manicot' over twice a week

40:49.405 --> 40:50.547
by washing your laundry.

40:50.698 --> 40:55.009
I mean, Rockefellers own racehorses.
Big-shot mafiosos own racehorses.

40:55.202 --> 40:59.847
Waiters don't own racehorses, Paulie.
You went on the street for the money?

40:59.999 --> 41:02.684
To Nappy. I took five large off him.

41:02.835 --> 41:05.061
- How much did he bang you for?
- 200 a week in juice.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.188
You got no gripe there,
but what are you gonna do

41:07.339 --> 41:08.898
if you can't make these payments?

41:09.049 --> 41:12.235
Pop, you should see this horse.
She runs in a couple of weeks.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.529
This horse is gonna make money, Pop.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.573
In my bones, I feel it.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.742
Paulie, look, God forbid,
I don't wish you any hard luck,

41:19.894 --> 41:21.494
but listen to me...
I don't think you're gonna see

41:21.645 --> 41:24.080
even a little piece of baccala
for this deal, you know?

41:27.193 --> 41:29.252
Hey, Pop, it's better you don't smoke.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.963
Jesus Christ, I'm surrounded!

41:33.240 --> 41:35.800
You know, Paulie, I should
have been a lot tougher with you.

41:39.246 --> 41:41.639
My brothers whack their kids a lot more.
They're better off.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.600
Nicky the Nose is better off?

41:43.751 --> 41:45.685
He's got a house in Staten Island.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.354
Pop, the Nose is my first cousin,
but he's a total asshole.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.399
Yeah? He trades in an Olds
98 every year.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.152
Pop, the Nose ain't even Napulitan',
for Christ's sake.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.487
It's his mother's side all the way.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.866
Genoese. He don't go for spit.

42:00.017 --> 42:03.119
The Nose shines his own shoes, Pop.
That's no big success.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.912
So what do you call success, huh?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.085
Knowing how to spend it.

42:11.278 --> 42:14.714
I never ordered a brandy
in my life wasn't Cordon Bleu.

42:14.865 --> 42:18.468
I took 500 from Shylocks, Pop,
to see Sinatra at the Garden.

42:18.619 --> 42:22.013
Sat two seats away from Tony Bennett.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.766
That's success, Pop.

42:28.462 --> 42:31.606
Where is this interview
you're going to tonight?

42:31.757 --> 42:34.150
Uh, it's around.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.862
You're not going to an interview.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.073
No.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.535
You don't even bother
to lie to me carefully anymore.

42:46.021 --> 42:48.998
It's an insult to be lied
to so obviously.

42:50.109 --> 42:53.878
Diane, I'll tell you what...
tomorrow I'm gonna turn over a new leaf,

42:54.029 --> 42:57.590
and I promise you,
my lies will be better.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.467
- Okay?
- Okay.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.138
- Come on. Let's dance.
- We can't dance to that.

43:04.331 --> 43:06.766
No, we can dance.
Vinnie, can we have some music?

43:06.917 --> 43:08.701
You got it, Charlie.

43:18.470 --> 43:19.987
It's closing time

43:23.517 --> 43:26.369
In this nowhere cafe

43:28.439 --> 43:33.418
There's no way in the world
I'm gonna let that girl

43:33.569 --> 43:36.254
Let her slip away

43:36.405 --> 43:37.547
Don't go.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.175
Don't go where?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.219
Wherever you're going.

43:43.370 --> 43:46.556
How can you tell me not to go
if you don't know where I'm going, huh?

43:48.292 --> 43:52.353
It's a mistake, Charlie.
You're making a mistake.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.288
This is it.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.832
What do you guys think?

44:13.150 --> 44:16.085
- What do you think?
- What do you mean, what do we think?

44:16.236 --> 44:18.629
Top floor's a tough spot.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.840
We gotta go by that like cats.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.468
- Cats.
- Wait here.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.907
What do you think, Charlie?

44:47.184 --> 44:49.285
- I think he's a fucking mope.
- Fucking mope.

44:49.436 --> 44:52.789
But he's careful.
You know, he seems to be prepared.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.457
Prepared, yeah.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.508
What do you think?

45:03.659 --> 45:05.510
I think he's prepared. Absolutely.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.386
No, what do you think?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.931
What do I think?
Of what? An alley? Come on.

45:17.423 --> 45:19.565
Okay, let's move it. Come on.

45:21.635 --> 45:25.154
- What is this for? What is this for?
- Don't worry about it.

45:25.347 --> 45:28.449
Make 'em look light and walk
into the place like we own the joint.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.261
What the hell is in these, Barney?

45:48.412 --> 45:52.557
Tools, nice Genoa salami,
a couple of Thermoses of coffee.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.642
- He's got an appetite.
- Come on, Paulie, just walk.

45:54.793 --> 45:57.228
Three hours in there, you'll be starved.

45:57.963 --> 46:01.190
I'm busting my balls, really.
Okay, you take this.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.697
Ma, do I have a clean T-shirt?

46:07.890 --> 46:10.283
Yeah, it's on
the kitchen chair someplace.

46:16.148 --> 46:20.877
You know, uh... Trusty Dream?
It's a four-year-old filly.

46:21.695 --> 46:22.837
No.

46:22.988 --> 46:25.047
She's in the third at Aqueduct.

46:25.199 --> 46:28.426
Six furlongs.
One-eleven in her last time out.

46:30.287 --> 46:33.139
She must be a nice little place bet.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.933
I like this horse.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.312
Want me to put your game show on, Ma?

46:39.463 --> 46:41.230
Nah, leave it alone.

46:41.381 --> 46:45.193
I can't even think with those assholes
jumping up and down and screaming.

46:52.559 --> 46:55.119
Do I have a clean handkerchief, Ma?

46:55.270 --> 46:57.455
It's in the drawer.

46:57.606 --> 47:01.459
I like your haircut, sonny.
Glad I talked you into it.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.888
At least go to the filters, huh, Ma?

47:16.458 --> 47:18.976
And those highballs,
they ain't doing you any good either.

47:19.127 --> 47:22.229
A little whisky is good for the system.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.736
And it's not the cigarettes
that give me the heart attack.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.989
It's 37 years...

47:32.140 --> 47:34.408
scrubbing floors on my hands and knees

47:34.560 --> 47:38.120
for those rich sons-of-bitches
on Park Avenue.

47:38.272 --> 47:42.124
Do you remember hauling garbage
after dinner every night of your life?

47:42.276 --> 47:44.835
Pulling on dumbwaiter ropes?

47:45.904 --> 47:48.089
I know. Your right arm is bigger.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.841
Yeah, twice as big as my left.

47:51.034 --> 47:54.220
Pulling dumbwaiter ropes
up five-storey buildings.

47:54.371 --> 47:57.690
Look, it'll protect you
from the muggers when I'm gone.

47:59.501 --> 48:02.061
Aw, Ma, one more year.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.982
One more year, Ma,
and I'll have my 20 in,

48:06.133 --> 48:08.192
and we'll head to Phoenix.

48:09.177 --> 48:11.153
Clean air, sunshine.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.115
I'll even teach you
to play a little golf.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.994
With that dumbwaiter arm of yours,
you'll drive the ball a mile.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.455
And what will you do, Walter?

48:23.191 --> 48:24.622
Liquor store.

48:27.279 --> 48:30.423
Big house, hacienda style.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.967
And I'm even gonna
have a little dumbwaiter put in

48:33.118 --> 48:34.885
just to keep that arm of yours in shape.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.556
And all this on a second-class
detective's pension?

48:38.707 --> 48:40.516
I got a little put away, Ma.

48:40.667 --> 48:45.604
That what your little recorder's for?
Keep track of your savings?

48:51.386 --> 48:54.905
It's just a little
personal protection, Ma.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.657
In case things go sour.

48:58.226 --> 49:00.202
I mean, this little box...

49:00.938 --> 49:04.165
well, it gives me a hand to play with,
you know what I mean?

49:05.067 --> 49:09.253
If things go sour, Walter...

49:09.404 --> 49:11.088
I got nobody left.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.215
I know, Ma.

49:17.245 --> 49:19.305
Oh, get outta here.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.101
Come on. Lock the door, huh?

49:24.252 --> 49:25.895
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.738
No, no, no. On your stomach.

49:35.889 --> 49:38.240
I look down, I'll freeze here
for a fucking week, man.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.160
Oh.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.371
- Come on.
- I don't work this high without a net.

49:44.523 --> 49:48.250
- It's your idea, this whole thing.
- Oh, God.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.242
All right, Charlie.

50:39.494 --> 50:42.513
- Go ahead.
- Why me, man?

50:42.664 --> 50:45.474
Why you? You're the monkey. You go. Go.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.395
Hold me, Charlie. Hold me, man.

50:49.546 --> 50:53.649
It's a tin can all dressed up.
Good for fires.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.110
Got a couple of broads
tucked in here, Barney?

50:56.261 --> 50:59.029
Cover the front, huh, Paulie?
Cover the front.

51:29.169 --> 51:30.728
Barney.

51:36.134 --> 51:38.569
- It must be the phone.
- Paulie, give me a break, all right?

51:38.720 --> 51:40.905
Give me a fucking break.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.364
Barney, what is that?

51:44.392 --> 51:45.576
Could be anything.

51:47.437 --> 51:50.380
- Could be a wrong number.
- Absolutely.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.597
There'll be 150 large there.

52:06.748 --> 52:09.225
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.601
That's all that counts now.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.689
That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.525
It's September 21st.

52:20.053 --> 52:22.071
11:25 PM.

52:22.347 --> 52:25.324
Heading for my monthly pick-up
on West Street.

52:27.018 --> 52:29.286
From there to Queens Village

52:29.437 --> 52:32.289
to deliver the money
to Inspector Ed Burns,

52:32.440 --> 52:35.417
whose voice will be
on this tape later on.

52:37.696 --> 52:41.799
Hope to be erasing this in Phoenix
in about a year.

52:45.787 --> 52:50.099
Did you ever see those big S&M fags?
They go into old buildings like this.

52:50.250 --> 52:54.144
Charlie, that's somebody's personal
paper you're reading there, man.

52:55.255 --> 52:58.440
Big mothers, too.
All dressed in leather and shit.

53:10.228 --> 53:13.998
These S&M fags get so carried away,
they beat each other up and whatnot...

53:14.149 --> 53:17.835
Will you please shut your mouth? You're
starting to sound like half a fag.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.545
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:26.494 --> 53:30.472
Hey, man, somebody's coming!
Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.474
Somebody's coming.

53:34.377 --> 53:36.395
Get out of sight. Grab the cases, fast!

53:36.546 --> 53:37.604
Come on, Paulie.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.606
- How many?
- One guy.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.651
- Cop?
- No, no, just a guy.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.828
One of the bosses probably
forgot something.

53:52.979 --> 53:54.705
If he comes in here, let me handle it.

53:54.856 --> 53:57.666
- We'll bluff our way through.
- Charlie, I gotta take a leak, man.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.960
Shh. Be quiet.

54:01.529 --> 54:03.130
Oh, fuck. The rope ladder.

54:40.860 --> 54:43.579
Freeze! Freeze or I'll blow you away!

54:46.616 --> 54:48.675
Shit.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.522
- Oh, man.
- Barney, he's not moving.

55:02.215 --> 55:04.817
What are we standing here for?
Let's get the hell outta here, Charlie.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.069
If he's breathing,
our best bet is to get outta here fast

55:07.220 --> 55:09.780
and call an ambulance,
crawl out from under a murder rap.

55:09.931 --> 55:13.409
Murder rap?! Nobody came
within 20 feet of that yo-yo.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.619
He dived into that hole
like a fucking gopher!

55:15.770 --> 55:19.039
If somebody dies during a crime,
it's murder, end of story.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.846
Barney, it's a dead cop down there.

56:16.498 --> 56:19.725
- Aw, man.
- A cop? Shit.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.686
You got a lot of explaining
to do now, Paulie.

56:22.837 --> 56:23.979
What?

56:25.715 --> 56:27.441
Hey, Barney,
what the fuck are you doing?

56:27.592 --> 56:29.735
- I'm a couple of seconds...
- No!

56:29.886 --> 56:31.445
It ain't gonna change the rap
one way or the other.

56:31.596 --> 56:32.821
No!

56:32.972 --> 56:35.491
Charlie, I ain't leaving this joint
with nothing in my kick after all this!

56:36.643 --> 56:38.444
I don't...

56:47.237 --> 56:49.129
What the hell
is a plainclothes cop doing

56:49.280 --> 56:50.839
wandering around in here after midnight?

56:50.990 --> 56:53.800
- Shit, I don't know.
- You don't know? Hey, you bastard!

56:53.993 --> 56:57.221
You know. You know!
Guaranteed it, you know, Paulie.

56:57.372 --> 56:59.348
You know, you piece of shit.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.853
Charlie, maybe he wasn't
even a real cop, man.

57:05.004 --> 57:07.898
Man, there must be 100 phony cops
wandering around out there,

57:08.049 --> 57:11.123
shaking people down and whatnot.

57:11.223 --> 57:12.319
Charlie, Charlie.

57:14.097 --> 57:15.697
- Charlie.
- Get off me, Paulie.

57:18.143 --> 57:21.995
Jesus, the kid was right.
There's a hell of a lot of money here.

57:22.147 --> 57:25.582
- The fucking lottery, Charlie!
- The fucking lottery?

57:25.733 --> 57:27.501
Paulie, there's a dead cop down there!

57:27.652 --> 57:29.711
What are you talking about?
You screwed us.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.506
You screwed us. You screwed me, man.

57:32.657 --> 57:33.757
I didn't screw you, Charlie.

57:34.367 --> 57:37.302
He knows. Guaranteed, he knows.
And you're gonna tell me.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.429
There is nothing to tell, Charlie.

57:39.581 --> 57:42.683
Nothing to tell, huh?
You're full of shit, Paulie.

57:42.834 --> 57:46.144
And you're so busy acting stupid,
that you got us on FDR Drive

57:46.296 --> 57:47.854
with commercial plates,
thank you very much.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.690
You shoulda let me drive, Barney.

57:56.514 --> 57:58.532
- Charlie.
- Paulie, shut up.

57:58.683 --> 58:00.742
I gotta take a leak, man.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.622
Charlie... I gotta take a leak, man.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.374
Jesus Christ.

58:18.578 --> 58:21.847
You know, he's got a bum bladder
ever since he was a kid.

58:21.998 --> 58:26.143
Charlie, whatever your beef is with him,
you gotta forget it now.

58:26.294 --> 58:28.061
We gotta find out
what the score is here.

58:28.213 --> 58:30.147
Ooh, man.

58:33.718 --> 58:37.613
Yeah, I know, I'm doing it wrong.
With him, you gotta be calm, right?

58:37.764 --> 58:38.989
Yeah.

58:51.319 --> 58:55.047
Charlie, what are you doing? Barney,
talk to him. Get him back inside.

58:55.198 --> 58:57.966
Fucking shut up! Paulie, come out here!

58:58.117 --> 59:00.510
Come out here. Come out here.

59:01.329 --> 59:04.556
- Paulie, get the fuck out here!
- Charlie! Charlie, the cops!

59:04.707 --> 59:07.100
I wanna know what the fuck
is going on right now, you tell me.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.144
You're not telling me something.
I wanna know now.

59:09.295 --> 59:10.687
I ain't holding back nothing!

59:10.838 --> 59:13.815
- Charlie, what the fuck are you doing?
- Shut up! You tell me right now.

59:13.967 --> 59:16.068
I ain't holding back nothing. I swear.

59:16.219 --> 59:17.736
I wanna know. I want answers.
You talk to me.

59:17.887 --> 59:18.987
I wanna know what's going on.

59:19.138 --> 59:22.699
- I ain't holding back nothing. I swear.
- Paulie, Don't you lie to me.

59:22.850 --> 59:25.118
- I swear.
- You swear on your kid brother, Vito.

59:25.270 --> 59:29.081
Say "Vito should get stomach cancer
if I'm lying to Charlie." Say that.

59:29.232 --> 59:31.249
That ain't fair, Charlie,
Vito got nothing to do...

59:31.401 --> 59:36.004
Say it. Say it. "Vito should get slow
stomach cancer if I'm lying to Charlie."

59:37.282 --> 59:39.383
Jesus Christ, Barney...

59:40.034 --> 59:41.760
- Tell me right now.
- Vito should...

59:41.911 --> 59:44.846
Jesus Christ,
you don't leave a guy no room.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.598
Tell me. Tell me.

59:46.749 --> 59:49.059
I didn't wanna bother you
with every last detail.

59:49.210 --> 59:50.977
There are things
I can take care of, you know.

59:51.129 --> 59:54.398
Like what? Huh? Like what?

59:55.383 --> 59:56.566
Like about Eddie Grant.

59:57.927 --> 59:59.111
Like what?

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.113
You know, Bed Bug Eddie.

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:05.492
What about Bed Bug Eddie?

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.038
What's the use
of kidding ourselves, Charlie?

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:11.832
That's his trucking company.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.085
Paulie, what's wrong with you?

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:18.964
I don't...

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.258
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter?

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.719
What is wrong with you? Huh?

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:26.263
What is wrong with you?

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.769
What's the matter with a score
like we made tonight, man?!

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:41.153
You been living
with that WASP girl too long.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.824
I don't wanna tell you
things to worry you, man.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.410
I brought you guys together, man.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.752
Kid who tipped you, what was his name?

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.337
Frankie Wheels.
He's from the neighborhood.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.798
Frankie Wheels
is gonna know you did it too, Paulie.

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:03.842
Charlie, I wormed it out of him, man.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:06.595
Bed Bug Eddie,
whoever hung that name on him

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.264
sure knew what the hell
he was talking about.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.308
The Bed Bug's got a thing
about hacking people up.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.143
What do you mean, hack up?

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.359
Look, we got one shot here.

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:27.324
We don't spend a nickel. Capisce?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.790
Well, we don't have to be crazy
about this either, you know?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.625
100 bucks here for a couple of suits...

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.418
Paulie, we don't spend a nickel,
all right?

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:41.171
Not a fucking penny.
You understand me? Not a penny.

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:43.673
Okay, not a penny. Shit.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.885
Just talking about
a couple of suits, you know?

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.137
Nickel-and-dime stuff, man.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.475
- Nothing major.
- Hey, not a fucking penny.

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:54.810
You understand me?

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.895
We don't spend...
we don't spend a penny.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.980
Not a fucking dime.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.774
Ain't he charming? The fucking idiot.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.362
You all right, honey?

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.990
Yeah, everything's fine. Go back
to bed. I'll be there in a minute.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.002
You woke her.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.927
Charlie, relax, man.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:32.973
I mean, God forbid, things really
go sour, I could reach out for us.

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:35.392
- To who?
- Pete.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.352
Uncle Pete would bail us out, man.

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:40.105
He's my goombah and, Charlie,
I still call him Uncle.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.065
And he's on Eddie Grant's crew, man.

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:43.900
You can't do shit, Paulie.

01:02:44.051 --> 01:02:46.319
Aw, Charlie.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.784
Charlie, I never knew nothing
about no payoff to cops, I swear.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:56.288
I never knew nothing, man. But
what I said would be there was there.

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.582
If I'd left it up to you,

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:01.585
we'd have gone out and robbed
that candy store over there, man.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:05.714
Hey, there comes a time
you got to cowboy it, Charlucc'.

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.382
Yeah.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:33.992
I got five grand for anybody
who brings me these thieves.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.077
I want that all over the street.

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:38.246
- Five?
- That's right!

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:39.998
Where do we stand with the cops, Eddie?

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.959
Let those Irish hard-ons
take care of themselves.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.753
I want those guys.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.442
They found him at the bottom
of an elevator shaft.

01:04:07.593 --> 01:04:09.110
I got the call just
as I was leaving the house.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:13.031
Jesus, that means the Internal Affairs
shoo-flies will be poking around.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:17.243
Brace yourself for worse news, John.
Ritter was wired.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.912
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:21.456
They found the adhesive marks
and the microphone.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.335
I've worked 27 years putting together
a little something

01:04:25.486 --> 01:04:27.003
for myself and the family.

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:30.131
There's 27 years hoarding in there.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:33.343
Stinking inflation eating it up
just as fast as I could fill it.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.947
Ease up, John.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:56.491
I'm drinking what I always have.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:04:59.452
You're drinking three martinis
in place of lunch every day.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:02.330
Then chewing up a whole
raw onion like it was an apple.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:04.791
You look like a neon sign
for Gordon's gin.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.470
Can I offer you a drink?

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.265
We're on duty.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.812
Hey! Excuse me.

01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:28.106
You on duty, too?

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:29.858
Yeah.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.571
Just a few questions, Mrs. Ritter.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:41.036
Did Bunky act peculiar
the last few months or so?

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.246
Different?

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.083
What the hell has that got to do
with some thief

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:49.586
pushing him down the elevator shaft?

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.507
He was wearing a tape recorder,
Mrs. Ritter.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.259
Do you know anything about that?

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.471
How the hell would I know?
You're the policeman.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.727
Did Bunky have a girlfriend?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.813
Who were some of his friends?

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.107
No one.

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:13.318
He went to church a lot.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.363
Sacred Heart.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.784
Most of his free time he spent there.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.327
He must have had some friends.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:27.540
It's important that we locate any tapes
that Bunky may have had.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:31.920
Yeah, I bet it's important.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:36.174
I bet it's very important
to the two of yous.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:44.599
The Internal Affairs people
were here hours ago.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:48.937
Two college-educated little pricks.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:53.066
Acted like they was
born and bred in Ohio.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.947
I'm gonna tell you what I told them.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:07.038
Walter neither drank nor gambled.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:10.041
He disapproved of the lottery.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:13.002
His spare time was spent making novenas

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.296
over at the Sacred Heart.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.507
Did they dig around in his room?

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:21.177
I wouldn't let 'em.

01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:23.388
Well, we're going to have to.
It's important.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.225
Now, uh... which room is Bunky's?

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.353
You are not poking around
in Walter's room.

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:33.731
We're going through this place, madam.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.358
You obstruct me and I'll personally see

01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.777
that you never see a cent
of his pension.

01:07:38.928 --> 01:07:41.990
Get out. Get outta here,
the two of yous.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:47.245
After you're gone, I'm gonna tear this
place upside down like a cyclone hit it.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.622
I'm gonna call The Daily News

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:53.376
to do a story on how
the New York City Police Department

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:55.795
treats the mother of a hero.

01:07:57.114 --> 01:07:59.299
My brother's a priest.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:04.387
He is an old-fashioned
parish priest with gray hair.

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:07.599
The two of us could do a scene
on the 6:00 news

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.059
would have this city in tears.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:19.027
My Walter was as tough as a bar of iron,

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.988
and he didn't get that from his father.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.410
Now, you wanna fight, officer?

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.582
Or do you get the hell out of my house?

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:11.162
Seven, eight! And one, two, three, four.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:15.207
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:19.170
To the side, two, three, four!

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.966
To the side, two, three, four!

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:26.761
Shoulders.
One, two, three, four! Reverse!

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.680
- What are you doing here?
- I have to talk to you.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.432
Three, four, keep going.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.352
Tina, can you take over for me
for a minute, please?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:38.356
They're trying out for a commercial.
We got a lot of work to do.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.566
Diane, I have to talk to you.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.902
Come on, Diane.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.238
Five, six, seven, eight, and one...

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:49.158
What are you doing here, Paulie?
Thinking of joining?

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.828
Maybe. Very possible. Looks nice.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.123
Seven, eight, and smile!

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.500
Paulie, give me a break.

01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:03.172
Seven and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, and hold!

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:05.842
Oka, gang, shake it out
a little bit, loosen up,

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.510
and we'll start from the beginning.

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:11.556
How could you have
put me in this, Charlie? Huh?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.976
I'm not... you're not in this.

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:17.937
A policeman died, Charlie.
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:19.188
A man died.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.275
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking world?

01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:33.536
There's a way out of this.

01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:38.291
There's 50 grand we got.

01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:42.628
Yeah, back in the closet.
That could be our way out.

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:46.132
It could be our restaurant.

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:50.094
Are you crazy? What do we do?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.306
Do we sit in our restaurant
and wait for the police to show up

01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:57.143
or some psychotic criminal to come
and find you and chop you up?

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:00.313
Oh, man.

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:02.523
You listened to that fool, Charlie.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:06.027
He's an idiot.
He lives in a fantasy, Charlie.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:08.154
Look,
Paulie has nothing to do with this.

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:12.742
- Diane, I made my own decision.
- Paulie uses you, Charlie.

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:15.161
Don't you see what you get
for your loyalty to family?

01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:16.621
He uses you.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:21.542
Why are you always one inch away
from becoming a good person, huh?

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:29.217
Maybe, I don't know...
maybe you're too soft.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:34.055
I'm just too soft?
What are you? Some tough guy?

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:38.226
The men up in Maine make you and Paulie
look like spoiled little brats.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.854
I was raised to believe
that criminals...

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:46.359
criminals were too weak,
too weak to make it honestly.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:50.655
Diane, maybe that shit works in Maine.
Here, on the streets, it don't work.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.865
Okay? It don't work.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.869
Such a pathetic excuse, you know?

01:11:57.021 --> 01:12:00.456
You just miss... you just miss by a...

01:12:00.607 --> 01:12:04.085
another fucking inch, you know,
and you could really be someone special.

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:06.921
But you're all caught up
in your tribal loyalty,

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:08.798
your neighborhood, Paulie...

01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:11.300
Diane, maybe I don't
wanna change, all right?

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.304
You ever think of that? Huh?

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:18.307
If I don't wanna change,
what the fuck are you doing with me?

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.396
What the fuck have you
been doing with me all this time?

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.277
I always knew this would happen.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.738
What the...

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:37.577
Hit me again. See if I change.
Come on. Hit me again. Come on.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.337
- Huh? Huh?
- Let go of me.

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:39.388
Charlie!

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.613
Nicky Dum Dum found out
who robbed my money.

01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:59.200
Well, that's great.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:03.037
How come it wasn't you that found out?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.998
Hey...

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.125
all my guys
been knocking their brains out.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.044
So Nicky got there first. Good for him.

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:13.089
Maybe you got there first
and you forget to tell me.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:16.342
What the hell are you talking about?

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.511
Somebody ratted.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:21.013
It was that kid from Carmine Street.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:26.561
Paulie somebody.
The kid you call your nephew?

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.147
Hey, Paulie don't rob safes.
He's a fucking waiter.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:34.443
He's a scumbag, that's what he is,
him and whoever was with him.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:08.853
Aw, man another 200-a-week hard on
looking to shit on anybody

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.438
who ain't driving a Coupe de Ville.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.440
- Guy's doing his job.
- Yeah?

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.087
- What did you drag me up here for?
- Come on in. Come on in.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.215
What's up?

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.595
Paulie. They're gonna nail him, Charlie.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:47.850
I can smell it. He left the file behind.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.728
- So what?
- Fingerprints!

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:55.733
Fucking shit. God damn him.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.110
And he's gonna feed them me.

01:15:59.012 --> 01:16:00.863
He won't give you up.
There's blood there.

01:16:01.014 --> 01:16:03.783
Blood. That fucking kid's blood.
We're third cousins. He's...

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:07.286
With Italians, that's like
twin brothers with the Irish.

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:09.497
And when he feeds me to them,

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.291
they're gonna press me
to give them you, Charlie.

01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:14.460
They're gonna press me hard.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:18.839
And if I clam up, you skate away,
clean as a whistle.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:25.346
Yeah? For what? How much?

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:29.183
Charlie, it's not what you think.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:32.937
My end of this, I want it for my kid.

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:37.608
I leave that money with my wife,
they'll take it off her in 12 minutes.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.903
I need somebody who'll make sure my wife
gets that money if I take a fall.

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:43.864
Whoa, Barney. Whoa.
There's got to be some other way.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.325
No, no, I've been making lists up
in my head for hours.

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:48.119
I got no one else, my friend.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.621
Why don't you just split
with the money now?

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.206
I can't.

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:55.376
I can't leave those two
until I'm backed dead into a corner.

01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:59.880
And I can't go on a lam
with a 25-year-old

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.508
needs the side of his crib
pulled up every night.

01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:05.219
Barney, you can't lay this on me.
Can't lay this on me.

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:08.347
- Charlie, I'm making you a deal.
- Open the door.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:11.225
- You got a sense of honor.
- Open the door.

01:17:11.376 --> 01:17:14.854
- I can smell it in ya.
- Open the fucking door, come on.

01:17:18.258 --> 01:17:21.235
It's saltwater. Briglia wants
to toughen up her legs.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.447
He's from the South.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:29.535
She looks like a fucking joke
rather than a racehorse, you know?

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:31.245
Joke? What are you talking about?

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.372
I got five grand on this horse, Paulie.
It better be no joke.

01:17:33.565 --> 01:17:35.332
I know, I know.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:40.171
It's just that I never seen a horse
with its legs in no garbage can.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.673
What do you know
about training a horse, huh?

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:46.719
Waiting tables is what you know.
Making cheese is what I know.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.846
Let's stay with what we know here.

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.515
You know about making cheese?

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.268
Not for nothin', Jimmy,
but my mother sent me over

01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:56.729
a hunk of mozzarell'
from your place last week.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.731
It was no big bargain.

01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:02.109
Tough, tat mozzarell', and it ain't
the first time I noticed it, either.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.196
- Your mozzarell' is tough sometimes.
- Are you nuts?

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.324
The Garguzzos never sold a piece
of tough mozzarell' in our life.

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:11.243
Tough like fucking shoe leather,
that mozzarell'.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:38.729
- Hey, Paulino.
- Hi, Uncle Pete. I was gonna call you.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:41.190
Let's go talk private.

01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:50.074
Where do you come off
to steal from Eddie Grant?

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:54.245
You ain't even a full-time thief.
You're a waiter, for Christ's sake.

01:18:58.024 --> 01:19:00.584
- Can you bail me out, Uncle Pete?
- I'm treading water myself.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.169
Oh, man.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:06.465
You pay attention,
'cause your life depends on this.

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:08.300
If you won't say
who was with ya, Paulie,

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.094
your head gets hung
on your mother's doorknob.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:12.179
He wouldn't really do that, Pete.

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.932
And he'd sit down to a steak pizzaiol'
right after.

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:18.227
Come on.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.774
And what if I rat?

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:26.068
He's still gonna do
a Bed Bug Eddie number on ya.

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:28.279
Man.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.199
He'd be making me a cripple.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:35.452
He wants to crush me. And for what?

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:39.123
For what? I didn't rape his daughter.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.375
I didn't spit in his fat face.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:45.880
I took money from him.
I took fucking money.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.050
It don't call for this, Pete.

01:19:53.302 --> 01:19:54.855
I gotta take a leak.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.148
Come on.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:10.279
Oh, man.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:20.956
Hey.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.883
What would you do,
you was in my shoes, Pete?

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:33.177
Me?

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.307
First espresso I carried to the bastard
would have a cupful of lye in it.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.937
What do I do?
I can't put lye in Eddie Grant's coffee.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:48.025
But I can't rat either.
I ain't built that way.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:51.278
Paulie, in my life,
I never told nobody to rat.

01:20:51.429 --> 01:20:54.657
But it ain't the old days.
Wise guys rat people out now.

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.700
I can't, Pete!

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.500
What happens to anyone what was with me?

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:09.296
- Who knows?
- Oh, man.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:13.300
What about the money?

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:15.719
What did you bag?

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.806
50 large. That's what my end came to.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:23.185
Gimme... gimme 43 to bring Eddie.

01:21:23.336 --> 01:21:26.188
Just say you blew the rest.
The maniac'll...

01:21:27.507 --> 01:21:29.525
The maniac will hardly even count it.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.113
What do they want?

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.409
This ain't no joke, Paulie.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.213
I had a partner, Pete.

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:55.134
I was with another guy.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.887
Some old Irish hard-on from the Bronx.
I don't owe him nothing.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.976
Barney. Fixes clocks.

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:06.353
Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue
in the Bronx.

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:09.732
An old guy.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:11.984
An old-time thief.

01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:20.701
Paulie, nothing ever hurts
like you think it will.

01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:22.286
You go numb.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:24.288
Then you wrap
your belt around your wrist

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:27.249
and you get yourself
to the nearest emergency room.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.502
Oh, Uncle Pete.

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:32.880
Oh, Uncle Pete...

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.473
Oh, Uncle Pete. Uncle Pete.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.600
Uncle Pete.

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:51.315
Uncle Pete!

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:58.072
Can you believe it?
Bed Bug had that kid's thumb taken off.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:00.908
Jesus Christ.

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:07.414
He's like some Arab sheik
walking around with that crazy bulldog.

01:23:07.565 --> 01:23:11.043
Yeah, but that's why Little Italy
got their own law and order.

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.753
Wanna know something?

01:23:12.904 --> 01:23:14.671
It's the only neighborhood in the city

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:19.093
where little kids and old ladies
can still walk the streets at night.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.137
Why the hell did Bed Bug
give us this one anyway?

01:23:22.288 --> 01:23:26.183
It's a favor, I think.
"You can have the Irish," he told me.

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.393
"Keep it in the family."

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.396
Fucking humps.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:34.775
They're all alike.
They think they're real cute.

01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:38.946
- There. It's over there.
- We got him here.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:59.902
Charlie... this is not easy for me.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:03.989
Our baby needs
a good start in life, Charlie.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:09.244
So I don't feel guilty about taking
the shoebox full of money for the baby.

01:25:09.395 --> 01:25:11.580
I've left you $5,000.

01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:16.168
With $45,000, our baby
will have a good chance in life.

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:20.130
It should be a comfort you to know that.

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:25.177
I've been thinking about what
my life would be like, living with you.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:28.263
The truth is, Charlie,
I can't go through life

01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:30.349
living with someone I could never trust.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.490
- Paulie, what happened?
- Charlie...

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:31.535
- they took my thumb, man.
- Who did? Who did?

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.287
It hurts so much.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:37.082
- Paulie, what happened?
- The Bed Bug took my thumb, man.

01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:41.003
Oh, no. No. Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:44.298
No, Charlucc'.
That guy's a fucking psycho, man.

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:45.799
He'll chop you up.

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:49.136
- Paulie...
- Oh, man, it hurts so much.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:51.179
- Did they give you anything for this?
- Yeah.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.764
- What did they give you?
- Yeah.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.017
They gave me... they gave me this stuff.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:57.894
They gave me this stuff at the hospital.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.647
But I took all of it.
I've been taking it all day.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.733
- You took all of this?
- It ain't done a fucking thing!

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.736
- You took all of this?
- I took it all, man.

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:10.282
- Charlie, I didn't do nothing, man.
- Paulie, what can I do for you?

01:27:10.433 --> 01:27:12.617
- What can I do for you?
- It was my life, man.

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:17.205
I didn't wanna give the poor bastard up,
but it was my life, Charlie.

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:24.212
Barney ain't family.
I don't owe him that much.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:25.922
You gave Barney up?
What about me, Paulie?

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.967
Paulie, I'm family.
Did they press you for me?

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:33.638
Yeah. Yeah, they... they pressed me.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.807
They pressed me hard.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:41.063
They took my thumb, Charlie!!

01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:43.940
Paulie.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.490
What the hell happened here, man?

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.578
Look at that chair, man.
What the hell happened here, Charlie?

01:27:56.729 --> 01:27:59.373
She walked out.
She took the money and she left.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:03.668
That twat robbed ya?
My God, what did you do, Charlie?

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:06.546
I didn't do anything, Paulie.
I didn't hit her. I didn't do nothing.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.006
You can't do that, man.

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:11.385
You don't abuse 'em once in a while,
they'll shit all over ya.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:13.595
I don't mean that you walk around
morning to night

01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:16.306
whacking 'em upside the head
like someone from the other side,

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:20.060
but you gotta terrorize 'em once
in a while just to keep 'em in line.

01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:21.728
I mean, like, you know,

01:28:21.879 --> 01:28:26.650
sometimes when they embarrass ya
in front of your friends,

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.568
you whack 'em with the backhand.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.280
Not out in the middle of the room
like some fucking animal, you know,

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:36.159
but nice, in the bedroom, you know?

01:28:36.602 --> 01:28:38.662
Ba-boom. Ow.

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:41.456
What am I? Some kind of asshole?

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:44.292
Ba-boom. Another one. Oh.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:47.629
Shit. What is this?!
Some kinda fucking joke?!

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.883
You get your coat on fast,
and you don't say good night to nobody.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:55.470
You understand me? Huh? Huh?

01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:02.936
That's to keep 'em humble.

01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:06.481
When you don't let 'em say
good night to nobody,

01:29:06.632 --> 01:29:10.485
they walk out
looking at the fucking floor.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.616
Charlie!!

01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:19.911
They took my thumb!

01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:24.416
Paulie. Paulie.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:36.928
Bed Bug, I'm gonna fucking kill you,
God damn it!

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.765
Paulie... Paulie... Paulie.

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:48.231
The motherfucking...

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.612
Paulie. Oh, Paulie.

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:57.365
I know... Paulie...

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.788
It's better if you don't know.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:06.708
Here.

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:11.880
Here's $1,000.
I'll send you $200 every week.

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:16.301
Nora, don't fall apart on me now, huh?

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:21.139
- Huh?
- How did you let this happen to you?

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:24.726
Oh, how did I let my whole
life happen to me?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:36.530
Why does it never work out right for us?

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.950
Why, Barney?
Why does it never work out right?

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:44.246
Nora, maybe I wasn't
the smartest kid on the block, huh?

01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:48.708
I did the best I could, huh?
For the three of us.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:02.180
I gotta go.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.669
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Aw, Jesus Christ.

01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:16.963
All right. Here.

01:32:17.114 --> 01:32:19.090
I was having a bad dream.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:21.343
How do you feel? Huh?

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.304
How's your hand?

01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:27.557
I don't know yet.

01:32:29.585 --> 01:32:31.978
You eat some of this.
You'll feel better.

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:34.022
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:40.070
Here you go.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:45.867
Yuck.

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.913
- What's the matter?
- It's canned, man.

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:52.415
- It's good for you.
- Yeah.

01:32:53.317 --> 01:32:55.377
White bread?

01:32:56.612 --> 01:32:59.839
No wonder these WASPs
got no color, huh, Charlie?

01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:06.429
Hey, maybe she...
she outgrew me, you know? I mean...

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.808
These WASPs, you know,
they outgrow people.

01:33:09.959 --> 01:33:11.434
Yeah, right.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.274
Our mothers was right, Charlucc'.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:21.069
You really gotta stick
with your own kind, you know?

01:33:21.804 --> 01:33:23.863
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:32.247
Charlie...

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:37.419
you know what really busts my balls?

01:33:40.072 --> 01:33:42.841
I gotta go to work for that maniac.

01:33:43.492 --> 01:33:46.970
I gotta be a God damn
coffee boy in the club.

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:01.109
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.779
- All right?
- Absolutely.

01:34:35.419 --> 01:34:36.561
Three sugars, Eddie?

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.443
Close the door.

01:34:54.605 --> 01:34:56.414
Sit down.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:08.802
No, sit over here.

01:35:23.342 --> 01:35:25.985
Do you ever listen to tapes, Paulie?

01:35:26.595 --> 01:35:31.741
Them, uh...
tapes that everybody sees all over?

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.456
I've been thinking
how you and that Irishman

01:35:38.607 --> 01:35:41.417
did that piece of work up there.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.586
It was you and him, no?

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:51.719
Barney. That's his name.

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:53.263
Barney.

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:56.641
This Irishman who you gave
two-thirds the split to?

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.855
- Are you comfortable, Paulie?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm comfortable.

01:36:03.048 --> 01:36:05.316
Tell me exactly how you handled it.

01:36:06.552 --> 01:36:08.903
Who carried the stuff upstairs?

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.198
Who watched the window?

01:36:12.349 --> 01:36:15.076
I wanna know
each detail of who did what.

01:36:19.231 --> 01:36:22.584
Well, uh... me and the Irishman,
you know, the two of us, we had...

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.002
Two?

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.004
Not three?

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:30.800
Two.

01:36:32.703 --> 01:36:35.513
Take it easy. Don't rush.

01:36:35.664 --> 01:36:38.224
We're gonna go through this
a couple of times.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:04.918
Hello?

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.295
Diane?

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:11.633
Diane, is that you?

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:26.189
Luna, luna, luna, lu

01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:30.193
I'll be waiting here for you

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:33.863
I live by moonlight

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:37.659
So give me moonlight

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:41.412
Who knows? I soon might

01:37:41.564 --> 01:37:44.916
Give you my heart

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:48.962
Luna, luna, luna, lu

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:55.426
Hey, Paulie, buddy.
Hey, where are you going?

01:37:56.495 --> 01:37:58.554
Take a hike, asshole.

01:38:23.188 --> 01:38:27.166
What was so important we had to
stop off at the apartment for that?

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:29.544
I got a phone call from Chicago,
from Barney.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:31.921
That was his end of it.

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.339
50,000?

01:38:33.490 --> 01:38:36.801
You just mailed $50,000
to some Irish retard?

01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:40.513
Hey, don't be so fucking selfish,
all right, Paulie?

01:38:40.664 --> 01:38:42.390
I mean, come on,
I thought about this the whole week.

01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:43.683
Had to do the right thing.

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:46.227
Charlie, some thief
is gonna hand the kid a rattle,

01:38:46.378 --> 01:38:48.104
and he's gonna give him 50 large.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:52.442
Shit. He sure as hell ain't gonna
go out and party with it, Charlie.

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.652
- You're a selfish fuck, you know that?
- "The right thing."

01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:21.888
That's for you.
Grab yourself a beer after work.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:23.347
Thanks.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:27.852
- What did you do?
- What did I do? I tipped the guy.

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:33.232
- Big shot.
- Charlie, I only gave him a buck, man.

01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:38.071
I mean, what is so terrible?

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:41.657
The poor victim stands in a little
closet breathing car fumes all day.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:42.950
The job's a sentence.

01:39:43.102 --> 01:39:46.079
Gotta throw 'em a beanie once just
to make their day, know what I mean?

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:50.041
Charlie, we made his day. His week.

01:39:53.737 --> 01:39:56.130
Big fucking shot you are, Paulie.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.680
Why the hell do you wanna
go to the grandstand?

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.766
The clubhouse is nicer.

01:40:06.917 --> 01:40:09.393
Hey, asshole, watch out, will ya?

01:40:09.586 --> 01:40:11.395
The grandstand's
where the regular guys are.

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:13.773
The clubhouse is full of phonies.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.656
I thought we was going
to the grandstand.

01:40:21.807 --> 01:40:23.407
No, man.

01:40:24.059 --> 01:40:26.911
The clubhouse is the only place
to really see a race from.

01:40:27.062 --> 01:40:29.372
You stay in the grandstand
and you're with every garbage can

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:30.623
walking the street.

01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:32.125
Every garbage can walking the...

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:35.169
You'll wind up with crabs
over there, you know?

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:39.799
Hey, Charlie, that's on me, man.
The midnight flight for Miami.

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:44.095
We're gonna make money here today,
then we're gonna party on the beach.

01:40:44.246 --> 01:40:48.099
We're gonna live like a couple of sports
instead of busted suitcases, you know?

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:50.852
Starry Hope. Ba-boom.

01:40:52.254 --> 01:40:54.689
See "TR"? That means "trainer."

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.440
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

01:40:56.592 --> 01:41:01.112
See where it says "F"?
"F," that means "filly."

01:41:01.263 --> 01:41:02.697
They call girl horses fillies.

01:41:02.848 --> 01:41:05.199
And if you see a "G," Charlie,
that means "gelding."

01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:07.034
That's when they whack
the horse's dick off.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:08.870
- Ba-boom, it's a memory, man.
- The balls, the balls.

01:41:09.021 --> 01:41:11.831
- The balls. The dick, man.
- No, they whack the balls.

01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:15.209
They whack the balls off.
They don't whack the dick off.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.211
Yeah, okay.

01:41:17.362 --> 01:41:20.256
Look at that pile of garbage
she's up against, man.

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:24.051
There'll be a flock of seagulls
following 'em around the track, man.

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:28.472
- What's going on with you today?
- What?

01:41:28.624 --> 01:41:30.766
You're acting really, uh... nervous.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:33.644
I'm excited, man. We're gonna
win money here today, Charlie.

01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:36.272
I feel it in my bones, man.

01:41:37.174 --> 01:41:38.900
How do you wanna go?
How do you wanna bet her?

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:40.484
- What do you mean, man?
- What do you want to do?

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:42.320
Wanna go straight across the board?

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:45.281
Jesus Christ, Charlie, don't jinx her
with place and show bets.

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:47.867
For once in your life,
don't hedge, okay?

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:50.786
You got a chance to win here today,
Charlie, play to win.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:53.706
Hey, Paulie, sometimes if you play it
a little safe, it don't hurt.

01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:56.125
Charlie, think like a winner, okay?

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:59.587
That's what it takes to bounce back,
and I should know, no?

01:41:59.738 --> 01:42:02.298
Johnny Black, rocks, man.
What you having, man?

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.592
- The usual.
- J&B over here.

01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:11.807
Starry Hope.
Post position four. That's okay.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.018
Let's see. Okay, look here.

01:42:14.169 --> 01:42:16.395
They tell you the color the jockey
wears, you know,

01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:18.439
so you can tell one horse from another.

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:21.901
Okay, let's see. Orange, pink yuk.

01:42:22.052 --> 01:42:23.444
- Pink what?
- Yuk.

01:42:23.595 --> 01:42:24.862
- What the fuck is a yuk?

01:42:25.013 --> 01:42:27.031
It's the thing that goes
around their neck.

01:42:27.182 --> 01:42:29.450
Hey, stupid, that's a yoke.

01:42:29.601 --> 01:42:30.868
- Yeah.
- A pink yoke.

01:42:31.019 --> 01:42:33.162
Yeah, pink blocks on sleeves.

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:37.750
Orange cap with pink pompom and visser.

01:42:39.236 --> 01:42:40.628
Can you believe that get-up?

01:42:40.779 --> 01:42:42.004
What's a visser?

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.798
A visser, it's the thing
on the front of the cap.

01:42:43.949 --> 01:42:46.300
See, you always do this.
That's a visor. That's a yoke.

01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:48.427
That's a visor.
You say "visser" and "yuk."

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.055
You get everything fucked up.
You better bet on the right horse.

01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:55.226
I'm not worried
about how to say the words.

01:42:55.377 --> 01:42:56.686
I'm worried
about how the jock's gonna look.

01:42:56.837 --> 01:43:00.439
The Cheese Man has him looking like
some fag partying at Fire Island, man.

01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:02.191
Paulie, why don't you
forget about the colors?

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.527
Is this horse gonna win here today?
Are we gonna make some money?

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:07.822
Is she gonna win? Is she gonna win?
He asks me "Is she gonna win?"

01:43:07.973 --> 01:43:11.158
Charlie, you laughed
when I told you about the champion gene,

01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:12.451
but she got it, man.

01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:13.744
The champion gene?

01:43:13.896 --> 01:43:17.665
The groom who jerked her father off...

01:43:17.816 --> 01:43:21.544
was not just winding his watch, okay?

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.089
Salut', Charlucc'.

01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:33.639
You're a strange man, you know that?

01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:36.017
You're gonna be kissing me
at the finish line.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:37.893
You're a very strange man,
Paulie Gibonni.

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:40.521
Salut', Sambrini.

01:43:44.927 --> 01:43:47.278
Easy, baby.

01:43:54.686 --> 01:43:57.872
In you go. In there. That's it.

01:44:08.659 --> 01:44:10.343
Whoa. Attaboy.

01:44:23.465 --> 01:44:24.607
Come on already. Come on already.

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.650
They're all in line.

01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.616
Moving out to get the lead, Persian Rug.

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:35.785
Come on, Starry Hope.
Come on, Starry Hope.

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:38.454
- Starry Hope moves up on the inside...
- Where is she?

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:40.956
Down the back stretch...

01:44:44.695 --> 01:44:46.462
There goes Starry Hope now
to get the lead.

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:49.548
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:56.347
All right! Go, Starry Hope!
Go, Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:01.602
Hemmings Way moves up quickly
between horses

01:45:01.753 --> 01:45:03.938
Starry Hope. Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

01:45:14.599 --> 01:45:15.825
Watch, Paulie. Watch.

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.082
Come on, baby. Paulie, watch!

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:25.584
Hope, Hope, Hope...

01:45:25.736 --> 01:45:27.294
Starry Hope, Starry Hope...

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:31.674
It's Starry Hope on the outside...

01:45:32.784 --> 01:45:34.468
Go, Starry. Starry Hope.

01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:41.600
- Tell me she won, Charlie.
- This result is not official.

01:45:41.752 --> 01:45:45.020
Charlie, tell me she won, Charlie.
Tell me she won, man.

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:47.773
- Tell me she won, Charlie.
- It's a photo.

01:45:49.718 --> 01:45:51.402
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be your name,

01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:53.237
thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:45:53.388 --> 01:45:55.489
Starry fucking Hope. Please, God.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.578
Please, please, please.
Please, God, please, please God.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.372
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go somewhere?

01:46:03.523 --> 01:46:05.082
Wanna go have a drink, huh?

01:46:05.233 --> 01:46:08.127
- I wanna go to Miami.
- You wanna go to Miami?

01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:11.505
Yeah. It's warm there, Charlie.

01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:15.468
Sit down over here.
I gotta go take a leak.

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:17.845
- You gotta take a leak?
- Sit down here, I gotta take a leak.

01:46:17.996 --> 01:46:19.763
- Okay, hurry.
- All right.

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:21.515
- Just stay there.
- Okay, but hurry up.

01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:22.850
Stay there.

01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:35.529
Damn. Shit.

01:46:36.515 --> 01:46:39.116
By a nose, man.

01:46:39.267 --> 01:46:41.327
By a fucking nose.

01:46:42.187 --> 01:46:43.954
Hey, you know,
she ran her heart out though, no?

01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:46.248
What are you gonna do?

01:46:47.442 --> 01:46:50.669
Be nice to get a photo of that finish.
We could blow it up, poster size.

01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:53.672
Yeah. I don't need no pictures.

01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:57.468
Hey, Paulie, money comes, and it goes.
Things are gonna work out.

01:46:57.619 --> 01:46:59.637
You just gotta take 'em
how they come, you know?

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:02.765
You gotta be a... good sport about it.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.354
- Got a dollar?
- You need 50 cents.

01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:15.277
Here.

01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:17.029
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:47:22.352 --> 01:47:23.827
You didn't tip him.

01:47:23.979 --> 01:47:26.163
Poor son of a bitch
stands in a booth all day long.

01:47:26.314 --> 01:47:28.874
Fuck him. What am I? Santa Claus?

01:47:29.025 --> 01:47:31.585
Fuck him? Hey, Paulie,
let me tell you something.

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:33.796
Don't worry about it
'cause when you connect,

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:36.215
you're gonna connect to big bucks.

01:47:36.366 --> 01:47:40.928
Me, I only connected
with a lousy 20 grand.

01:47:42.372 --> 01:47:44.557
Charlie.

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:49.019
I knew you kept some of Barney's money.
I knew you weren't no dummy.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:51.647
No, baby, I, uh... bet
Starry Hope across the board.

01:47:54.384 --> 01:47:57.444
That's why she lost!
You jinxed her, Charlie!

01:47:57.596 --> 01:47:59.655
You jinxed her, man.

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:12.126
Hey, Charlie, that's a hydrant.
We can't park here.

01:48:12.277 --> 01:48:13.627
Hey, please, give me a break.

01:48:13.778 --> 01:48:15.546
What do you want me to do,
drive round the block?

01:48:15.697 --> 01:48:17.590
It's a $25 ticket, Charlie.

01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:19.925
Hey, Paulie, thank God it's here.
It's worth every cent.

01:48:20.076 --> 01:48:21.427
Hey, man, this is crazy.

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:24.430
We ought to be on our way
to Miami right this second.

01:48:24.581 --> 01:48:26.098
It's warm there, Charlie.

01:48:26.249 --> 01:48:27.933
Let's have one drink, huh?

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:31.312
- Okay, one drink.
- Yeah.

01:48:31.463 --> 01:48:32.563
- One.
- Yeah.

01:48:32.714 --> 01:48:34.356
Absolutely.

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:37.568
I'll have a Remy, soda back.

01:48:37.719 --> 01:48:39.695
- I'll have the same, Tony.
- Things could be worse, huh?

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:40.988
Yeah.

01:48:41.139 --> 01:48:42.906
Things could be worse.

01:48:43.058 --> 01:48:45.576
I mean, I got the restaurant after all.

01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:50.748
To the restaurant.

01:48:50.899 --> 01:48:52.416
Salut', Charlucc'.

01:48:56.071 --> 01:48:57.838
Okay, that's our one drink.
Let's go, Charlie.

01:48:57.989 --> 01:49:00.007
Whoa, Paulie, what is the hurry?

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:04.053
Can we stay here, have a drink
and relax a little bit? Huh? Huh?

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:06.221
Yeah.

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:10.601
By the way, I didn't ask, uh...

01:49:10.752 --> 01:49:13.103
- How's your pop doing?
- Oh, good. Good, yeah.

01:49:13.255 --> 01:49:14.772
Good? Oh, hey.

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:16.440
He's doing good.

01:49:17.008 --> 01:49:18.317
He'll be all right.

01:49:18.468 --> 01:49:20.194
Charlie, there's something
I gotta tell you.

01:49:30.313 --> 01:49:33.082
I'm really sorry about
this whole mess, you know?

01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:37.503
Hey, Paulie. Hey.
Don't worry about it, all right?

01:49:38.154 --> 01:49:40.005
Okay? Things are gonna work out.

01:49:40.156 --> 01:49:44.051
I mean, aside from Diane leaving and...

01:49:44.202 --> 01:49:45.928
you know, what happened to your hand.

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:48.222
It's gonna be all right.

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:52.393
Hey, ci andiamo, huh?

01:49:52.544 --> 01:49:54.395
Forever. Absolutely.

01:49:57.465 --> 01:50:00.109
Okay, that's it, Charlie. Let's go, man.

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.277
Put your money away. I got it.

01:50:03.805 --> 01:50:05.864
Anthony.

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:09.993
Keep it.

01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:12.871
Can we please take a walk
for a minute, Charlie?

01:50:14.899 --> 01:50:16.291
What for?

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:18.252
There's something I gotta tell you, man.

01:50:21.406 --> 01:50:22.673
So tell me here.

01:50:24.909 --> 01:50:26.176
Barney.

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:34.393
Something funny must have gone down
up there in the Bronx, you know?

01:50:34.544 --> 01:50:39.022
Uh, those... those cops
who grabbed Barney, you know?

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:42.067
Uh, they must have
made a deal or something, Charlie.

01:50:42.218 --> 01:50:43.986
Where you going?
Where the fuck are you going?

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:46.780
Talk to me. What are you talking about?

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:49.783
The Bed Bug knows about you, Charlie.

01:50:52.062 --> 01:50:53.245
What?

01:50:55.190 --> 01:50:58.709
You fucking little... you fucking rat!

01:51:00.028 --> 01:51:04.006
Charlie! Fucking Superman
would have broke, man.

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:08.719
Superman wouldn't have held out.
Charlie, I was just so fucking scared.

01:51:10.455 --> 01:51:12.514
Fucking bum.
You're a fucking bum, Paulie.

01:51:12.666 --> 01:51:15.017
Charlie, Charlie,
we won money today, man.

01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:17.895
We can go to Miami.
We can go to Miami. Please, Charlie.

01:51:18.046 --> 01:51:20.939
- You wanna know something?
- We can go to Miami.

01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:22.816
You wanna know something,
you piece of shit?

01:51:22.967 --> 01:51:25.444
Diane was right.
You're no fucking good, Paulie.

01:51:25.595 --> 01:51:27.279
- You ain't no fucking good.
- Charlie!

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:29.072
- No, you screwed me, Paulie.
- Charlie!

01:51:29.224 --> 01:51:32.034
Charlie, we could go to Miami.

01:51:40.568 --> 01:51:43.587
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

01:51:43.738 --> 01:51:45.422
That's all that counts, no?

01:51:45.573 --> 01:51:47.591
That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:50.719
It's September 21st.

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:54.264
11:25 PM.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:58.894
Heading for my monthly
pick-up on West Street.

01:52:00.422 --> 01:52:02.439
From there, to Queens Village

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:05.651
to deliver the money
to Inspector Ed Burns,

01:52:05.802 --> 01:52:08.862
whose voice
will be on this tape later on.

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:15.160
Hope to be erasing this in Phoenix
in about a year.

01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:18.473
This is a private club, pal.

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:20.642
Well, I'd like to see Eddie Grant.

01:53:32.263 --> 01:53:34.281
He's in the back room.

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:52.007
You're Charlie Moran?

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:55.802
You're one of the scumbags
that robbed my money.

01:53:57.705 --> 01:54:00.265
You were brought up around here, no?

01:54:00.416 --> 01:54:02.601
Carmine Street.

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.354
Same thing.

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.898
And you know you owe
the neighborhood some respect.

01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:13.111
People steal from Eddie Grant,
it makes for a total breakdown.

01:54:13.263 --> 01:54:15.447
No one knows right or wrong.

01:54:15.598 --> 01:54:17.950
Before you know it,
you got mulenyams moving in.

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.036
What the hell brings you in here?

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:26.208
A tape I took off a dead cop
that'll hang you by your balls.

01:54:28.486 --> 01:54:30.337
You walked in here to threaten me?

01:54:30.655 --> 01:54:32.656
You're fucking right
I walked in here to threaten you.

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:39.012
The last time somebody talked to me
close to that was from the Village, too.

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:41.807
I parcel-posted the scumbag home.

01:54:41.958 --> 01:54:44.768
He didn't have the tape
that could put you away for 20.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.397
Okay, let me give you some advice.

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:51.525
You're behaving like
a mammalucc'. Capisce?

01:54:51.676 --> 01:54:54.319
You walk in here.
You don't show the club no respect.

01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:56.446
You're acting like a scumbag.

01:54:56.598 --> 01:54:58.532
You're half Irish, so I...

01:54:58.683 --> 01:55:00.951
I make considerations.

01:55:01.978 --> 01:55:03.787
I give you this for the tape.

01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:11.086
I promised myself
I'd wipe my ass with this hand.

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:12.879
And nobody...

01:55:13.781 --> 01:55:17.009
nobody but the Pope
could walk out of here with his hand.

01:55:22.332 --> 01:55:24.266
Mister, I am the Pope.

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.977
This might be your church,
but right now,

01:55:27.128 --> 01:55:30.731
I'm the Pope of Greenwich Village,
because I got a tape, all right?

01:55:38.139 --> 01:55:41.908
I like you. You have balls.
I don't get too mad at that.

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:45.579
Coffee, Eddie?

01:56:02.205 --> 01:56:03.555
Three sugars, Eddie?

01:56:14.258 --> 01:56:16.276
I already put your sugar in, Charlie.

01:56:56.718 --> 01:57:00.403
Lye! I filled his fucking
espresso with lye!

01:57:05.768 --> 01:57:07.410
You got one shot here.
Run. Run like hell.

01:57:07.562 --> 01:57:09.496
- What did you do? I had him.
- What do you mean, what did I do?

01:57:09.647 --> 01:57:12.124
I went all the way for you, Charlie.
Come on.

01:57:12.275 --> 01:57:15.043
Okay, walk slow and be cool.

01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:18.421
- Great.
- Charlie, we got a shot here.

01:57:18.573 --> 01:57:20.882
We got tickets for Miami.

01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:24.845
Charlie, things could be
a hell of a lot worse, man.

01:57:24.996 --> 01:57:27.347
I mean, we got $20,000 in our pocket.

01:57:27.498 --> 01:57:29.307
Things are looking up, Charlucc'.

01:57:29.459 --> 01:57:32.060
Paulie, you know,
you got a serious thinking disorder.

01:57:32.211 --> 01:57:33.937
What are you talking about?

01:57:34.088 --> 01:57:35.981
What am I tal... oh, yeah,
things are looking up.

01:57:36.132 --> 01:57:38.275
Absolutely.

01:57:38.426 --> 01:57:40.652
I had him. I had him, Paulie.

01:57:40.803 --> 01:57:45.740
Charlie, what I done back there,
I done 100% for you, man.

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:48.243
For me, right. You tell me about it.

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:50.871
And another thing, man,
you need me, man.

01:57:51.022 --> 01:57:52.330
Without me along,

01:57:52.482 --> 01:57:55.083
you'd be nickel-and-diming it
in ten minutes, man.

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:57.752
- I'm the one with the moves.
- You the one with the moves?

01:57:57.945 --> 01:58:00.130
The summer wind

01:58:00.323 --> 01:58:02.716
Came blowing in

01:58:02.867 --> 01:58:05.719
From across the sea

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:10.348
It lingered there

01:58:11.334 --> 01:58:13.768
To touch your hair

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.730
And walk with me

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:21.484
All summer long

01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:24.070
We sang a song

01:58:24.222 --> 01:58:28.658
And then we strolled that golden sand

01:58:31.687 --> 01:58:34.080
Two sweethearts

01:58:34.857 --> 01:58:37.751
And the summer wind

01:58:41.697 --> 01:58:43.965
Like painted kites

01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:46.259
Those days and nights

01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:49.512
They went flying by

01:58:52.458 --> 01:58:55.018
The world was new

01:58:55.169 --> 01:59:00.982
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:08.240
Then softer than a piper man

01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:13.411
One day it called to you

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:18.208
I lost you

01:59:19.193 --> 01:59:22.504
I lost you to the summer wind

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:28.134
The autumn wind

01:59:28.286 --> 01:59:30.178
And the winter winds

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:33.265
They have come and gone

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.853
And still the days

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:41.481
Those lonely days

01:59:41.632 --> 01:59:44.901
They go on and on

01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:50.323
And guess who sighs

01:59:50.474 --> 01:59:53.118
His lullabies

01:59:53.269 --> 01:59:57.455
Through nights that never end?

02:00:00.318 --> 02:00:03.378
My fickle friend

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:13.847
The summer wind

02:00:14.123 --> 02:00:16.891
Warm summer wind

02:00:20.087 --> 02:00:24.024
Mm, the summer wind

02:00:25.305 --> 02:00:31.551
