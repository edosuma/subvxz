ain't working, Mike.

    How does thinking about your
     mother help you keep cool? 

01:24.885 --> 01:26.951
     Well, she used to say      
    that keeping cool           

01:26.953 --> 01:29.654

you'd stick to me.

so crowded, so jam-packed

 What happened, Gloria?         

02:04.557 --> 02:08.392
        Nothing. Nobody         
      even turned around.

shower and I may never come out.

                 getting warmer!

02:23.309 --> 02:27.411
Oh, and you wanted me           
to get colder.

fresh-made lemonade.

            out of the fridge.

    for the use of the mixer.

up, so I overhauled it for you.

learn all that?

             so sick and tired  

03:04.251 --> 03:07.218
         of being talked down to

03:26.807 --> 03:28.106

she won't give them to you

     she's dishonest.

    It's just that she          
catches colds all the time

and that makes her breathe

to Levy's Fish Market.
