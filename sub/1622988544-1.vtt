01:00.625 --> 01:02.583
All of my dreams...

01:03.958 --> 01:07.583
...and all of my nightmares - come true,

01:09.833 --> 01:12.500
often simultaneously.

01:17.083 --> 01:22.083
When I was 6 years old, my mom
moved us to the countryside

01:22.250 --> 01:24.291
to live with her parents.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.956
There was a small river by the house

01:26.958 --> 01:29.998
which led down to a modest little dam,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.541
which would accumulate enough
water to create a pond.

01:33.416 --> 01:36.833
A pond which to me as a
boy felt like an ocean.

01:39.541 --> 01:42.289
I would climb the trees and
fling myself from the branches

01:42.291 --> 01:43.831
into the water, and...

01:43.833 --> 01:47.039
...build this makeshift rafts
that I would call ships...

01:47.041 --> 01:51.789
...and create entire cities
out of rocks and twigs,

01:51.791 --> 01:55.623
make friends, talk to the animals,

01:55.625 --> 02:00.373
enemies - curse the ones
who had bitten or stung me

02:00.375 --> 02:03.373
and at first, there was
always a new territory,

02:03.375 --> 02:05.458
someplace I hadn't discovered yet,

02:06.625 --> 02:07.581
but...

02:07.583 --> 02:09.413
...see, there was a limit -

02:09.416 --> 02:11.873
as to how far I could venture and back

02:11.875 --> 02:14.458
before the sun would go down.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.748
I was told I had to return home

02:17.750 --> 02:20.706
before the sun fell asleep.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.914
My mom used to say that...

02:26.500 --> 02:27.541
She loved sleep.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.623
Loved it.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.458
She would sleep most of the day

02:33.583 --> 02:34.750
if I remember,

02:37.416 --> 02:38.248
but...

02:38.250 --> 02:39.539
maybe I don't...

02:39.541 --> 02:40.706
...cause I wasn't around,

02:40.708 --> 02:41.748
I was off,

02:41.750 --> 02:43.081
scurrying about,

02:43.083 --> 02:44.623
trying to see what was just beyond

02:44.625 --> 02:48.708
what I had discovered
last, what friends or...

02:49.541 --> 02:50.873
...enemies,

02:50.875 --> 02:52.916
would be lying just beyond that valley,

02:54.166 --> 02:57.831
in that cave that I saw at
those mountains in the distance.

02:59.791 --> 03:04.164
So... eventually I decided
to break her limitations,

03:04.166 --> 03:06.498
disobeying my curfew.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.539
I didn't care if she got angry,

03:09.541 --> 03:10.373
but...

03:10.375 --> 03:14.873
...the real dismay came from
finding that she was right.

03:14.875 --> 03:17.414
We needed to sleep.

03:17.416 --> 03:19.125
We needed it

03:20.083 --> 03:23.581
and the earlier I would start
off in the morning to explore,

03:23.583 --> 03:25.873
the earlier I would become exhausted

03:25.875 --> 03:27.750
and the slower I would travel, and...

03:28.583 --> 03:31.581
my weak instincts would
force me to head home,

03:31.583 --> 03:33.998
to the comfort of a bed.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.456
I couldn't help myself, I...

03:36.458 --> 03:39.206
...couldn't get through that valley, I...

03:39.208 --> 03:41.206
...couldn't get to that
cave in the distance

03:41.208 --> 03:44.000
no matter how hard I seemed to try.

03:45.166 --> 03:49.039
So the places I used to play
became sedatingly familiar.

03:49.041 --> 03:52.289
My once mystical sea became a pond again,

03:52.291 --> 03:54.248
my enchanted cities, just...

03:54.250 --> 03:56.666
...twigs and mud.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.748
So I began to pray...

03:59.750 --> 04:01.623
...every night...

04:01.625 --> 04:02.748
...that this burden

04:02.750 --> 04:05.206
that seemed to belong to some other entity

04:05.208 --> 04:06.498
would be...

04:06.500 --> 04:08.289
taken out of me...

04:08.291 --> 04:11.664
...never to need sleep again.

04:11.666 --> 04:13.373
And then,

04:13.375 --> 04:17.373
before I knew it, my mom
picked up our lives again

04:17.375 --> 04:21.748
and moved us to a "proper
city," as she put it.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.955
One filled with proper people and...

04:24.957 --> 04:27.330
proper noise,

04:27.332 --> 04:29.457
and more proper people...

04:30.582 --> 04:34.707
and my desire to explore
my surroundings... reversed.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.916
And so did something else.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.582
Since then, at the age of seven,

04:45.457 --> 04:47.664
I have not slept...

04:47.666 --> 04:50.332
...a single minute of my life.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.582
And

04:58.500 --> 05:00.458
now I am

05:01.541 --> 05:03.291
the ungrateful.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.958
My answered prayer

05:08.833 --> 05:10.706
mocking me.

05:14.541 --> 05:15.750
So...

05:17.416 --> 05:19.500
That's crazy!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.375
Let, there's no way you
haven't slept for, like,

05:25.582 --> 05:28.789
since you were seven years old?

05:28.791 --> 05:29.914
I'm...

05:29.916 --> 05:34.123
I'm pretty sure your brain
is affected or has trouble

05:34.125 --> 05:35.957
functioning after,

05:36.916 --> 05:39.289
really, even if you'd only
be up for 24 hours straight,

05:39.291 --> 05:40.957
you would be losing it.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.955
Come on, if it was that bad,

05:50.957 --> 05:53.289
if it was really so much of a thing,

05:53.291 --> 05:55.580
why wouldn't you have tried everything?

05:55.582 --> 05:58.998
Why wouldn't you have just
taken enough sleeping pills

05:59.000 --> 06:00.206
to pass out?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.083
I've tried that.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.625
I just end up basically
paralyzed for half a day.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.998
My body stops moving, I end up drooling,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.581
collapsed on the floor, but
I am still very conscious,

06:15.583 --> 06:19.416
watching the dust for 10 hours straight.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.498
No! Come on...

06:26.500 --> 06:29.875
...wouldn't you technically
die from lack of... um...

06:32.166 --> 06:33.455
Lack of what?

06:33.457 --> 06:35.080
Trust me, I've researched everything

06:35.082 --> 06:37.498
you can imagine about sleep.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.580
Truth is, there's no
real satisfactory answer

06:40.582 --> 06:43.873
as to why creatures sleep.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.414
Some animals like dolphins,

06:46.416 --> 06:49.916
transfer energy from one side
of there brain to the other.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.373
That's the way one doctor
put it, he said that,

06:53.375 --> 06:55.582
"When my body was resting,

06:56.541 --> 07:00.123
that my brain would think
of different things."

07:00.125 --> 07:03.083
I was resting different
sections during that period,

07:06.000 --> 07:06.833
but I don't...

07:08.250 --> 07:11.914
I don't dream, I don't
escape my hard consciousness

07:11.916 --> 07:13.875
the way I did when I was a kid.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.623
There is no such thing as waking up to a

07:17.625 --> 07:20.457
mentally rested and better day, for me.

07:23.082 --> 07:24.000
It's all...

07:26.000 --> 07:26.832
one day.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.582
I do miss dreaming, though.

07:34.457 --> 07:35.750
Very clever.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.955
Huh?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.875
You're very clever,
but it's not gonna work.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.332
You're messing with me, I can tell.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.291
Very good at sticking with it.

08:51.708 --> 08:52.540
It's fine.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.000
It's fine if this is
how you want to play it.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.583
I don't mind proving it.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.916
I'm spending the night.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.916
We'll see who falls asleep first.

14:44.708 --> 14:47.623
Yeah, I know, it's completely insane.

14:47.625 --> 14:51.456
I know, I've been doing
this since what, 1987?

14:51.458 --> 14:55.248
...nothing, I've never had
anything like this happen before.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.458
No, no.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.038
Well, I gotta let you go.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.414
Yeah, he just walked in a little bit ago.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.581
Yeah, yeah, I can't wait to tell him.

15:03.583 --> 15:07.583
I know, wait till he hears the news

15:08.625 --> 15:09.456
Yeah, Sunday...

15:09.458 --> 15:11.706
Sunday's good, yeah.

15:12.750 --> 15:13.873
Putt-putt...

15:13.875 --> 15:15.123
That's the only thing I do.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.623
Yeah, I don't do the...

15:17.625 --> 15:19.539
the "golf" golf.

15:19.541 --> 15:22.039
I mean, who does that? I mean...

15:23.250 --> 15:24.164
Okay.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.581
Yeah, love to the missus!

15:25.583 --> 15:27.083
Okay, bye-bye.

15:28.875 --> 15:29.706
...turn this fu...

15:30.791 --> 15:31.623
So...

15:35.250 --> 15:39.083
Crazy news, but good... good news.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.248
I know you claim you don't sleep, but...

15:45.250 --> 15:47.581
today you actually look
like it, man. Whatsa matter,

15:47.583 --> 15:49.125
you had a rough night
last night or something?

15:53.458 --> 15:56.083
Well, this should put
some spring in your step.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.000
We got an offer

15:59.208 --> 16:00.291
for a shoot

16:01.208 --> 16:03.123
tonight!

16:03.125 --> 16:04.208
Tonight?

16:05.375 --> 16:07.873
That's a bit last minute, isn't it?

16:07.875 --> 16:09.166
Oh, yes it is.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.956
That's true, but wait.

16:11.958 --> 16:12.791
Wait for it.

16:15.791 --> 16:18.250
Here's the thing.... You
know what the offer is?

16:20.208 --> 16:21.375
You know what it is?

16:23.333 --> 16:25.414
No, I don't know what it is.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.916
I'm assuming it's money.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.498
Maybe just a bag of sea monkeys.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.333
I think you're getting warmer, yes.

16:37.750 --> 16:38.788
What is it?

16:40.665 --> 16:42.038
Come on, what is it?

16:44.208 --> 16:45.540
I'll tell you what it is.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.000
It's name your own price.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.538
What?

16:53.540 --> 16:57.208
This woman, she must come
from old money or something.

16:58.165 --> 16:59.916
Have some big company behind her?

17:01.708 --> 17:05.248
Maybe she's from one of
those royal families,

17:05.250 --> 17:06.788
I'm not sure.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.455
I'm not sure where she's from actually.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.080
I couldn't quite place her accent.

17:11.083 --> 17:11.913
Or...

17:11.915 --> 17:14.208
her affectation, I should say.

17:15.790 --> 17:19.705
She just had a different way of speaking.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.080
She was almost embarrassed
to suggest a price.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.580
She said she would leave that up to you,

17:25.583 --> 17:27.208
that any price was fine.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.456
About the tonight part.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.081
Well...

17:39.083 --> 17:40.416
technically she uh...

17:42.708 --> 17:45.000
she wants you to meet her at 3:00 a.m.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.498
I mean, for name your price,

17:49.500 --> 17:52.664
you should be as chipper as a
blue jay at any hour, right?

17:52.666 --> 17:55.831
But I can understand
you might be a little...

17:55.833 --> 17:56.956
Well, what...

17:56.958 --> 17:59.373
what kind of shots are
we talking about here?

17:59.375 --> 18:00.831
I don't know?

18:00.833 --> 18:04.083
I mean, this woman was really vague.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.998
I guess she just saw some
of your editorial work

18:07.000 --> 18:08.414
or something.

18:08.416 --> 18:09.956
She only seems to care that it was you

18:09.958 --> 18:12.123
taking the shots.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.706
When I asked her for details,

18:13.708 --> 18:15.625
she said she'd just leave that up to you.

18:16.625 --> 18:19.248
That they were for personal use,

18:19.250 --> 18:21.498
whatever that means.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.875
So, So I guess she just saw
some cool shots in a mag

18:25.791 --> 18:27.750
and she figured I gotta...

18:28.625 --> 18:31.750
"I must be shot by this photographer."

18:33.000 --> 18:35.083
She's got the money so, ya know.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.706
Maybe she's just into the
whole wigged out at 3:00 a.m

18:39.708 --> 18:42.291
look, or motif, or what not, ya know.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.623
Or maybe she knows something
about the moonlight at 3:00 a.m

18:47.625 --> 18:48.708
that I don't.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.583
What, it's outdoors?

18:53.791 --> 18:55.414
Well, I... I don't know,

18:55.416 --> 18:56.831
I assume so...

18:56.833 --> 18:59.416
maybe a backyard or something.

19:00.416 --> 19:03.373
When I asked her what kind of
lighting we needed to book,

19:03.375 --> 19:04.748
she said we didn't need to book any,

19:04.750 --> 19:06.833
just you and the camera.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.498
I mean, I told her that
even natural lighting is

19:11.500 --> 19:14.373
usually staged to look natural

19:14.375 --> 19:17.414
and she just kept saying "moonlight..."

19:17.416 --> 19:19.250
"moooonlight..."

19:20.250 --> 19:21.581
just like that too.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.664
So clearly, this woman dances to the beat

19:24.666 --> 19:27.083
of her own drum. Clearly.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.498
Anyway, here's the address.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.125
Her name is Aurora.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.250
Her assistant will meet you there.

19:42.208 --> 19:45.039
Who apparently has no name

19:45.041 --> 19:48.291
or she doesn't seem to
think it was important.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.833
I would tell you to be careful, but...

19:56.208 --> 19:57.791
I already charged her a deposit.

20:00.583 --> 20:03.250
One hundred thousand dollars.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.125
And it went straight through!

20:09.041 --> 20:11.458
She didn't even hesitate
when I mentioned it! Boom!

20:12.875 --> 20:15.041
Something just told me she was loaded.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.750
One hundred thousand dollars!

20:26.916 --> 20:31.498
So yeah, I was thinking, too,
"this sounds really shady...

20:31.500 --> 20:33.666
...could this be a
setup to take his gear?"

20:36.125 --> 20:38.664
Clearly, I think you're... uh...

20:38.666 --> 20:41.498
I mean, that's why I set
the deposit price so high.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.706
I mean, they'd have to be the
dumbest criminals ever to...

20:44.708 --> 20:46.333
...you know...

20:50.458 --> 20:52.083
So clearly, I think you're uh...

20:55.500 --> 20:56.750
...you're good.

21:00.125 --> 21:00.958
So...

21:02.375 --> 21:04.375
What shall we charge?

21:10.333 --> 21:11.831
This...

21:11.833 --> 21:14.123
...address...

21:14.125 --> 21:16.750
...across from the park where I...

21:23.583 --> 21:24.875
...never mind.

23:37.708 --> 23:38.541
Hello?

24:54.625 --> 24:56.581
Go to the place where you walk.

24:56.583 --> 24:58.958
She is waiting there for you.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.333
Let.

27:43.458 --> 27:44.291
Take

27:45.333 --> 27:46.166
my

27:47.791 --> 27:48.833
picture.

27:56.708 --> 27:57.541
Please.

28:44.041 --> 28:44.875
You should

28:46.875 --> 28:47.708
stay

28:48.791 --> 28:50.000
still.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.083
How?

29:05.000 --> 29:05.956
I

29:05.958 --> 29:07.289
guess you

29:07.291 --> 29:09.206
know this,

29:09.208 --> 29:10.041
but I

29:11.750 --> 29:12.583
come here

29:15.083 --> 29:15.916
a lot.

29:18.625 --> 29:19.458
Yes.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.333
You do.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.750
At this exact time.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.664
How long have you...

29:48.666 --> 29:50.166
I mean...

29:52.625 --> 29:53.456
What's...

29:53.458 --> 29:54.291
Let.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.125
What do you want?

30:03.000 --> 30:03.833
What

30:05.000 --> 30:06.373
do you

30:06.375 --> 30:07.208
want?

30:10.916 --> 30:14.291
I don't think I need to answer that.

30:16.708 --> 30:18.250
You want

30:20.375 --> 30:21.998
sleep.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.748
What?

30:25.750 --> 30:27.373
Don't you?

30:29.791 --> 30:32.039
I can give you

30:32.041 --> 30:34.373
true rest.

30:34.375 --> 30:38.541
The kind that makes you feel alive again.

30:39.750 --> 30:43.456
The kind that fills your entire being

30:43.458 --> 30:46.164
with what you now only think of

30:46.166 --> 30:49.831
as your deepest consciousness.

30:49.833 --> 30:52.708
No more screens to filter through.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.083
No more looking from the outside.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.623
You will fully

31:00.625 --> 31:01.914
be.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.583
Your planet is

31:20.625 --> 31:21.458
changing.

31:23.833 --> 31:24.750
Oh, well.

31:26.875 --> 31:27.914
My planet?

31:27.916 --> 31:32.331
Beyond what your species
is capable of processing

31:32.333 --> 31:34.333
or able to understand.

31:35.541 --> 31:39.331
Sleep as your planet has
known it up until now

31:39.333 --> 31:41.706
will become impossible.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.706
Others will be unable to sleep,

31:44.708 --> 31:47.041
draining their consciousness,

31:48.208 --> 31:49.083
but for you,

31:50.125 --> 31:52.583
it is already obsolete.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.958
You have asked for a
different kind of rest

31:57.916 --> 31:59.500
and I can offer it.

32:01.208 --> 32:05.541
True rest as you have
never known it before

32:06.708 --> 32:08.000
and you will be...

32:09.291 --> 32:10.125
Reborn.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.541
Come...

32:28.375 --> 32:32.458
I don't think I'm the right
guy for your uh... shoot.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.664
I'll have Markus refund your money.

32:35.666 --> 32:38.581
Let, don't go.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.748
Oh no, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.581
I'm gonna go.

32:41.583 --> 32:44.539
Let, you don't understand.

32:44.541 --> 32:45.914
You're right.

32:45.916 --> 32:48.289
I don't and I don't think I need to.

32:48.291 --> 32:49.500
Thank you.

32:58.750 --> 33:02.666
Let!

35:41.208 --> 35:42.541
I lost my phone.

35:45.166 --> 35:48.333
I'm sorry, I guess I figured
that you would be up.

35:51.375 --> 35:52.873
I couldn't sleep, either.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.416
I'm just feeling very, uh...

35:56.541 --> 35:58.750
very disoriented.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.414
I remember where you
live, but for some reason,

36:11.416 --> 36:14.250
I couldn't focus on where I was.

36:17.625 --> 36:19.708
Guh! Sounds stupid, um...

36:20.625 --> 36:23.456
I've been wandering
around your block for...

36:26.375 --> 36:29.458
Um, you have a very interesting block.

36:31.791 --> 36:33.208
A lot night owls.

36:36.041 --> 36:38.791
I guess it's appropriate for you.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.458
Am I bothering you?

36:49.583 --> 36:50.416
No.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.581
Sorry.

36:52.583 --> 36:53.416
Just...

36:54.500 --> 36:55.500
No, come in.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.873
What do you do

38:01.875 --> 38:04.416
when you can't sleep?

38:06.583 --> 38:07.833
What do you do all night?

38:13.833 --> 38:17.083
I go through different phases, I guess.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.208
Sometimes I just

38:21.166 --> 38:22.708
lie down and think.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.083
I hate thinking.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.000
I think.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.539
Maybe not. I don't...

38:33.541 --> 38:36.873
What is thinking, anyway?

38:40.666 --> 38:41.500
Yeah...

38:43.291 --> 38:46.291
...and what's not thinking, I guess.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.125
Been going on a lot of walks

38:55.708 --> 38:56.541
at night

38:59.166 --> 39:00.206
in nature.

39:00.208 --> 39:02.791
Can I come with you sometime?

39:17.250 --> 39:19.791
Can I see your pictures?

39:22.375 --> 39:24.291
Are they from a job?

39:27.875 --> 39:28.708
Who?

39:33.791 --> 39:34.791
I'm not...

39:36.375 --> 39:37.208
...sure.

39:55.875 --> 39:56.708
Celeste?

40:02.041 --> 40:03.375
Try to lie down?

40:05.375 --> 40:06.208
Okay.

40:43.916 --> 40:44.750
I'm sorry.

40:47.291 --> 40:48.875
I can't feel.

40:58.291 --> 40:59.708
Will you kiss me?

42:53.833 --> 42:55.873
This moon thing, huh?

42:55.875 --> 42:57.041
What the fuck.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.250
Can't sleep it all obviously. Nobody can.

43:03.416 --> 43:04.958
It's what it seems like, anyway.

43:06.791 --> 43:08.750
You don't watch the news though, right?

43:11.250 --> 43:12.083
Right?

43:14.916 --> 43:16.250
People need sleep, right?

43:17.958 --> 43:20.291
I took ten sleeping pills last night, ten!

43:22.250 --> 43:23.416
You know what happened?

43:26.166 --> 43:28.831
I just ended up eating
everything in the fridge.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.833
It's like they had no effect on me at all.

43:32.333 --> 43:34.583
I don't know which way
is up or down anymore.

43:36.541 --> 43:40.791
I seem to still have energy,
but I can't think too well.

43:43.166 --> 43:44.375
A whole other moon.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.041
Some cult guy was saying
it was always there.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.664
It was just hidden from
view behind the other moon.

43:56.125 --> 43:58.414
But we went to the moon, right?

44:01.625 --> 44:03.625
And we have satellites and stuff, right?

44:04.583 --> 44:06.289
I mean, how could that be possible?

44:06.291 --> 44:07.916
We would have seen it.

44:09.708 --> 44:11.164
Unless all that was a hoax.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.875
Maybe we never really went to the...

44:15.375 --> 44:17.789
And the scientist on TV was saying that

44:17.791 --> 44:19.750
it came through a wormhole.

44:21.625 --> 44:23.956
It just went in one end of the universe

44:23.958 --> 44:25.541
and popped out another.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.291
That makes more sense, right?

44:31.125 --> 44:35.541
I mean, black holes and
stuff, those are real, right?

44:37.541 --> 44:38.375
But a wormhole...

44:39.458 --> 44:40.623
that's different, right?

44:44.833 --> 44:46.456
I don't know, man.

44:46.458 --> 44:48.831
I just need some

44:48.833 --> 44:49.833
fucking sleep.

44:51.041 --> 44:52.623
Phew!

44:56.000 --> 45:00.039
So, how'd the shoot go last night?

45:03.916 --> 45:06.666
Couldn't have been that bad, huh?

45:09.333 --> 45:12.498
Marcy hasn't been out of the room all day.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.414
I've gotta field my own calls.

45:17.083 --> 45:19.291
How do people read this?
What does this even...

45:23.291 --> 45:28.039
Yeah? LMQ, this is Markus, may I help you?

45:28.041 --> 45:29.041
Hello?

45:39.083 --> 45:42.666
Let.

46:06.875 --> 46:08.206
Come

46:08.208 --> 46:09.706
back.

46:09.708 --> 46:11.289
I can

46:11.291 --> 46:12.125
help.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.539
Same

46:15.541 --> 46:16.789
hour.

46:31.291 --> 46:32.164
Markus.

46:41.083 --> 46:41.916
Markus.

46:43.166 --> 46:44.750
Maybe you should...

46:47.500 --> 46:48.791
Lie down.

47:13.375 --> 47:14.208
Markus?

48:16.541 --> 48:17.375
Celeste?

48:19.291 --> 48:21.789
What are you doing, you okay?

48:21.791 --> 48:23.208
What are you doing out here?

48:24.166 --> 48:25.958
I thought you were gonna try to rest.

48:28.333 --> 48:29.583
I don't know.

48:31.166 --> 48:32.666
I keep forgetting.

48:35.541 --> 48:37.458
Oh, I went to find you.

48:38.458 --> 48:39.875
Where did you go?

48:41.708 --> 48:44.831
To meet Markus, you don't remember?

48:44.833 --> 48:46.416
We talked before I left.

48:47.833 --> 48:50.248
You don't remember that?

48:50.250 --> 48:51.291
Oh!

48:52.708 --> 48:53.541
Oh!

48:58.416 --> 49:00.041
Oh, yeah, I just...

49:02.750 --> 49:03.666
I remember.

49:06.416 --> 49:08.583
I remember everything now.

49:13.791 --> 49:15.625
I was wandering around

49:17.583 --> 49:20.416
and I saw a woman crash her car...

49:22.166 --> 49:23.000
just...

49:27.916 --> 49:28.916
And I saw

49:31.125 --> 49:31.958
a man.

49:35.666 --> 49:37.750
He walked up to a cop

49:39.208 --> 49:40.041
and...

49:41.625 --> 49:43.208
and he asked the cop

49:44.250 --> 49:45.875
to kill him

49:46.958 --> 49:48.291
right there.

49:54.291 --> 49:58.331
He did it. He pulled out his gun,

49:58.333 --> 50:02.041
shot him in the head, and put
it back like it was nothing.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.333
Come on.

50:05.791 --> 50:07.333
Let's go inside.

50:52.708 --> 50:56.125
When was the last time you ate something?

50:57.125 --> 50:57.958
I...

50:59.250 --> 51:02.000
I can't remember.

51:14.500 --> 51:18.041
Sometimes it's strangely
comforting to feel small.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.833
But if I get any smaller,

51:24.625 --> 51:26.706
I think I might I disappear.

51:53.208 --> 51:54.041
Celeste.

52:02.083 --> 52:03.916
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

52:06.083 --> 52:07.375
Don't go anywhere.

52:08.333 --> 52:09.164
Okay?

52:09.166 --> 52:10.541
Can you stay right here for me?

52:11.416 --> 52:12.291
Can you remember?

52:14.833 --> 52:15.750
I have to...

52:20.583 --> 52:21.750
see something.

52:25.875 --> 52:27.456
Try to remember, okay?

52:27.458 --> 52:29.706
I'll be right back.

52:29.708 --> 52:31.208
Don't go anywhere.

55:16.291 --> 55:21.083
Your world's consciousness
is being arrogated.

55:22.541 --> 55:26.373
An interdimensional
being is using the energy

55:26.375 --> 55:29.789
humans put toward identity

55:29.791 --> 55:33.498
and purpose as a means of feeding

55:33.500 --> 55:35.458
its own lucid dream.

55:37.083 --> 55:40.248
Consuming their life energy

55:40.250 --> 55:43.625
as a source for its own desolate utopia

55:44.833 --> 55:48.750
ending the cycle that feeds
life as your planet knows it

55:49.625 --> 55:52.791
and replacing it with its singularity,

55:54.250 --> 55:55.083
a void.

55:57.125 --> 56:02.125
But you, Let, you have spent
most of your life without sleep

56:02.916 --> 56:07.581
and are therefore never fully conscious

56:07.583 --> 56:10.458
and never fully unconscious.

56:11.291 --> 56:15.208
Immune to the pull of
the being's lucid dream

56:16.833 --> 56:18.583
where you currently stand.

56:19.666 --> 56:22.333
You are conscious enough
to see what is happening,

56:23.291 --> 56:26.664
but not awake enough to fight back.

56:26.666 --> 56:31.123
If you choose to accept true rest,

56:31.125 --> 56:34.248
you will reemerge with the ability

56:34.250 --> 56:39.250
to affect and control your surroundings.

56:39.333 --> 56:43.708
You will be truly alive
for the first time.

56:44.625 --> 56:49.625
Your purpose and direction
will be illuminated to you

56:49.833 --> 56:54.581
and from within you, and you
would be able to seek out

56:54.583 --> 56:59.583
the infectious being and
end his iniquitous reign.

57:04.916 --> 57:07.916
But, there is a price.

57:10.791 --> 57:13.750
With your new sense of
vision will come enemies

57:15.125 --> 57:17.831
and though you will have
the clarity of consciousness

57:17.833 --> 57:22.708
to see them, they will
become aware of you, as well.

57:23.958 --> 57:28.958
The being and its extensions,
his left and right hand,

57:32.000 --> 57:36.375
they see what he sees and
they will be able to spot you

57:39.041 --> 57:39.875
as a threat

57:41.541 --> 57:44.625
and Let, their sole purpose

57:45.583 --> 57:48.248
is to eliminate...

57:48.250 --> 57:49.083
threats.

57:52.166 --> 57:53.250
I don't understand.

57:56.208 --> 57:57.623
How?

57:57.625 --> 57:59.289
How am I supposed to... find...

57:59.291 --> 58:04.291
There are no more
questions that I can answer.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.083
I'm here

58:07.958 --> 58:09.750
because you wished me to be.

58:12.333 --> 58:14.916
If you wish to know more...

59:29.125 --> 59:31.583
There is one more price.

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.625
Open the door. Go inside.

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:09.791
Do you have a weapon?

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.123
Bring me the weapon you'd use

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.208
if someone broke into your apartment.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:49.791
Hide.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.125
Drive North.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:42.539
Point to your car.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.041
Give me your keys.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.250
Where are we going?

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:16.875
To find who's doing this to you.

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:23.916
Stand up.

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:16.916
Celeste, let's go. Come on.

01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:28.166
Move over here.

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:24.166
Hands

01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:27.208
bring food to the mouth.

01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:51.873
Celeste.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:52.708
Let.

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:59.164
Trust me.

01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:01.539
No, please don't leave me, Let.

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.248
Do not leave me.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.623
Trust me, please.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.791
Let me come with you.
Let me come with you.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.708
Next time you wake up

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:15.873
you're gonna be fully conscious.

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:18.123
You're gonna be yourself again.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:21.123
Let me come with you.

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:22.541
Trust me.

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:59.625
Have you ever
had a dream that came true?

01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:08.083
You think I'm using people

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.291
like cogs in a wheel,

01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:21.875
but you're not stopping to think

01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:26.125
that without the wheel,

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:29.208
the cogs have...

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.416
no purpose.

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:38.708
But you...

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:45.041
you think that you've found purpose.

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:58.458
The only purpose you have found

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:01.166
is in ending mine.

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:08.541
What kind of purpose is that?

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:17.875
Were you that empty before?

01:20:22.041 --> 01:20:24.125
At one time, you weren't.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
At one time,

01:20:29.708 --> 01:20:31.458
you wanted to explore

01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:34.875
and I,

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:39.000
I was your helper,

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:44.958
but you became...

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:47.208
impatient.

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:51.458
You turned on me

01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.958
and wished me away.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:58.708
Bitter...

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.416
Towards your own fuel,

01:21:05.166 --> 01:21:07.541
I was only carrying you

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.208
where you wanted to go.

01:22:13.125 --> 01:22:14.583
But now...

01:22:17.041 --> 01:22:18.833
Now it's too late.

01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:35.750
Now you have become the anti-wish.

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.041
You have become

01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:47.333
what is limiting us.

01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:22.250
You're trying to kill everyone's dream,

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.791
not just mine.

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:29.958
Do you want us all to be loose cogs?

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.166
What would happen to you

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.333
if I was gone

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.625
back to your limbo?

01:24:51.333 --> 01:24:54.664
You cannot find true purpose...

01:24:54.666 --> 01:24:56.500
in taking it away.

01:25:01.291 --> 01:25:02.541
You're right.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:09.291
I cannot take your purpose from you.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.539
If it wishes...

01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.748
Your sacrifice

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.456
is its own reward.

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:30.956
...it can take itself.

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:13.416
Where are we going next?

01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:24.083
Never mind.

01:26:27.625 --> 01:26:31.416
You're not invited anymore.

01:27:40.416 --> 01:27:43.333
There is one more price.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:49.664
If you choose to become fully conscious,

01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:51.206
you

01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:54.833
will never be able to regenerate again

01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:58.748
and the next time you rest

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.581
will be

01:28:00.583 --> 01:28:01.916
eternal.
