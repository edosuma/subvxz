01:05.648 --> 01:06.733
Okay, but which boo?

01:06.816 --> 01:08.485

10:06.606 --> 10:08.482

to not have a mama,

10:08.566 --> 10:11.402
and you still abandoned
your boys, you stupid bitch.

changed all of us, didn't it?

without a mother.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.891
We made it.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.100
Huh?

42:03.979 --> 42:05.147
Andre, wha...

42:07.942 --> 42:08.943
No.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.487
No.

42:12.821 --> 42:14.823
-Give him to me, Teri.
-No.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.158
-Teri!
-No!

42:16.242 --> 42:17.993
Give him to me now.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.745
No.
No, no--

42:19.828 --> 42:21.497
-Let go!
-Oh.

42:22.039 --> 42:25.376
Oh, no!

42:25.459 --> 42:27.002
-Look what you did.
-Shh.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.838
You try to take
my son from me again,

42:29.922 --> 42:31.632
it will be the last time
you ever see him.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.800
Do you understand?

42:36.136 --> 42:37.263
I asked you a question.

42:37.346 --> 42:38.847
Do you understand me?

42:39.056 --> 42:40.140
I do.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.142
Walker's everything
to me, Teri.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.602
He's irreplaceable.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.272
You are not.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.734
Now let's go home.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.445
