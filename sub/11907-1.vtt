01:24.460 --> 01:25.461
Good morning, sir.

01:25.545 --> 01:28.298
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.

01:28.381 --> 01:30.133
Mr. Walker.

01:30.842 --> 01:34.012
Room 2105, South Tower. Great view.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.599
We also have a larger unit available
on the east side

01:37.682 --> 01:39.309
I can offer you at the same price.

01:39.392 --> 01:41.102
No, I think I'll stick with the view.

01:57.035 --> 01:59.579
Is it too early for champagne?

01:59.662 --> 02:02.874
Not at all, sir. Not at all.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.817
Look! There's a man up there!

03:54.318 --> 03:56.237
Look! Right there!

03:56.320 --> 03:58.156
- Where?
- Right there!

04:00.408 --> 04:02.577
Somebody call 911!

04:10.168 --> 04:11.878
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!

04:11.961 --> 04:13.212
<i>All inmates...</i>

04:23.806 --> 04:27.852
<i>So your final appeal
has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.</i>

04:29.020 --> 04:30.521
That's why I am here.

04:34.358 --> 04:38.029
It's a waste of time. Can I go? Mmm-hmm?

04:41.783 --> 04:43.201
Your old life is over.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.037
You're gonna have to accept
that it's never coming back.

04:48.706 --> 04:54.587
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop,
can handle a 25-year sentence.

04:56.214 --> 04:57.548
Mmm-hmm.

05:04.055 --> 05:08.100
Nick, have you ever
considered hurting yourself?

05:10.228 --> 05:11.896
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.231
No.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.609
But killing,

05:18.903 --> 05:21.239
every goddamned day.

05:24.534 --> 05:25.952
Go ahead.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.923
Hey, Cass.

05:40.925 --> 05:41.926
It's been a while.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.803
Yes, it has.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.183
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.310
I went shopping.

05:51.394 --> 05:55.773
I'm about to be a married man,
so gotta clean up a little bit.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.608
Who's the lucky guy?

06:00.862 --> 06:03.948
You know, man. Hey, life goes on, right?

06:12.623 --> 06:13.791
Yeah.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.127
I'm sorry.

06:17.128 --> 06:20.172
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.

06:20.756 --> 06:24.886
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do. You know?

06:24.969 --> 06:26.095
- It's okay.

06:30.933 --> 06:31.934
No kissing.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.483
Your brother called.

06:41.319 --> 06:42.820
I'm sorry.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.406
What'd he want? He ask for money again?

06:45.489 --> 06:46.991
It's your dad.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.036
- Yeah?
- He's...

06:52.246 --> 06:53.289
He's dying.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.671
- How long?
- Soon.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.676
Look, I'll talk to the warden.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.429
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.931
- Mmm.
- All right?

07:15.519 --> 07:16.729
Take care of yourself.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.192
Yep.

08:00.940 --> 08:06.320
And when a good soul is taken from us,
it's hard to find reason to believe.

08:07.071 --> 08:11.117
But having faith in God's promise,
and faith in yourself,

08:12.410 --> 08:14.412
is your one true ally.

08:15.413 --> 08:20.001
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.293
Amen.

08:21.377 --> 08:23.337
- Amen.
- Thank you.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.590
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.597
Hey, Cass. I'm sorry, man.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.182
It's nice to meet you, Nick.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.101
Likewise.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.650
Anything I can do, just let me know.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.654
I'll be there, okay?

08:49.447 --> 08:50.698
Yeah.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.708
Ma'am! No contact!

09:00.791 --> 09:04.128
Hey. Pretty girls can break the rules.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.721
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.064
Is this the best you could do?

09:23.147 --> 09:25.441
View of the goddamned tracks?

09:26.442 --> 09:28.652
You killed him the day you went to prison.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.030
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.

09:31.113 --> 09:34.575
Oh, yeah? You know, Nick,
we're doing real good without you.

09:34.658 --> 09:35.701
Yeah, looks like it.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.249
- Hey! Break it up, you two!
- Break it up! Come on. Get up!

09:42.333 --> 09:43.667
Get your ass back to prison!

09:44.293 --> 09:45.628
Get off me! Get away!

09:45.711 --> 09:47.463
- All right. Calm down.
- Calm...

09:47.546 --> 09:48.881
Down! Down! Put your gun down!

09:48.964 --> 09:50.508
- Time's up!
- Down!

09:50.591 --> 09:51.759
The hell are you doing?

09:51.842 --> 09:55.513
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie. Think about it.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.767
All right. Take it easy, Nick.

09:59.850 --> 10:03.270
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.147
Hey, Joey. Keys.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.608
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!

10:08.734 --> 10:11.612
- On the belt.
- Hurry!

10:14.365 --> 10:15.699
You better not come back here.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.034
Yeah, I didn't plan to.

10:17.868 --> 10:21.580
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey. Get down!

10:24.667 --> 10:25.876
Nobody move.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.336
Way to make Dad proud!

10:32.550 --> 10:35.261
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!

10:35.344 --> 10:38.722
All backup units,
prisoner's heading to the east gate!

12:11.857 --> 12:13.651
Get a paramedic out here, now!

12:15.486 --> 12:17.404
- See him?
- I can't see anything.

12:24.495 --> 12:25.704
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.

12:25.788 --> 12:26.997
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

12:28.165 --> 12:29.875
He jacked the guards and took my car.

12:30.251 --> 12:31.585
Jesus.

12:34.672 --> 12:38.425
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.411
Look! There's a man up there!

13:48.245 --> 13:51.290
- Look! Right there!
- Where?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.505
We got a guy on the roof.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.885
I need an Emergency Service Unit
at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.721
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.143
Back up! Back up!

14:18.776 --> 14:21.528
45th Street, between 5th and Madison,
is closed.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.123
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?

14:33.582 --> 14:35.709
You gotta be kidding me.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.465
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.436
No pedestrians. No vehicles.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.401
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.210
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker. Stay calm.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.129
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.424
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.926
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.970
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.055
Get the street locked up. Businesses, too.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.599
I don't want this guy
falling on someone's head.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.977
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.854
Let's do it. Come on.

15:38.147 --> 15:39.898
Dougherty, report.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.693
All right. Hang tight.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.447
Yeah, 21st floor.

15:46.530 --> 15:50.284
Jumper's mid-30$,
looks like a professional type.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.619
<i>- And he's not talking.</i>
- Got it.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.916
Detective Marcus.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.128
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your
staff that had any sort of contact with him.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.213
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?

16:03.297 --> 16:04.548
Yes, sir.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.759
Don't do it, man!

16:15.058 --> 16:16.310
Mr. Walker...

16:16.393 --> 16:18.020
I want a woman.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.856
All right, look. If that's what this is
about, what do you say we come inside,

16:20.939 --> 16:24.776
we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde? Brunette? You name it.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.361
Detective Lydia Mercer.

16:27.696 --> 16:32.451
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?

16:33.410 --> 16:37.372
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.458
You're not gonna believe this.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.126
- Wants Mercer.
- What?

16:41.210 --> 16:44.254
He says if we don't get
her, he's going off.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
His "Last Supper"?

16:46.340 --> 16:49.134
Not a good sign. And take a look at this.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.849
Yeah. More likely he's
going to the nuthouse.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.478
All right. I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.438
And call Mercer.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.316
What? Are you kidding me? Seriously?

17:04.398 --> 17:06.276
You'll back her up. You're my guy.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.905
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?

17:31.009 --> 17:32.052
Shit.

17:46.942 --> 17:47.943
Yeah?

17:48.026 --> 17:50.821
<i>Jesus Christ, Mercer,
did I wake you up?</i>

17:51.405 --> 17:54.741
Of course not. Hang on. Just hang on a sec.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.327
<i>Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.</i>

17:57.411 --> 17:58.662
<i>Mercer?</i>

17:59.371 --> 18:00.956
<i>Mercer?</i>

18:01.540 --> 18:02.666
All right, what?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.501
<i>We got a jumper, and you're up.</i>

18:04.585 --> 18:07.379
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
<i>- No shit.</i>

18:07.462 --> 18:10.465
<i>The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor. Right now.</i>

18:13.093 --> 18:15.220
Oh, crap.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.141
Roger that. We've got links with traffic
control, the precinct, and the hotel.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.727
Get the cameras up. Anything on J. Walker?

18:21.810 --> 18:24.062
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.439
Go figure.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.442
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.281
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it. Right over here.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.867
Let's go from where he swerves around
Ready?

18:36.950 --> 18:38.201
Is my hair okay?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.578
Gorgeous.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.163
Don't fluff me, Paul.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.956
Three, two, one.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.084
Unlucky in love? Victim
of the stock market?

18:46.168 --> 18:48.295
A young man contemplates death.

18:48.378 --> 18:51.131
This is Suzie Morales reporting live
from Midtown.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.758
Stretch it full down
to the corners, all right?

18:52.841 --> 18:54.885
All right, got it.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.850
Oh, man.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.561
Good luck hitting this.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.663
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey! Back up!

19:22.746 --> 19:25.248
I got a right to walk where I want.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.376
All sealed off.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.920
Shit.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.637
Mercer.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.597
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.599
You'd better be. Get to it.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.272
<i>Mercer's on her way up.</i>

19:49.356 --> 19:51.441
Enter the Grim Reaper.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.486
Mercer.

19:55.445 --> 19:59.116
Welcome back. It's so
good to see you again.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.410
Kiss my ass, Jack.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.079
FYI, he asked for you. By name.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.247
What's the scene?

20:05.330 --> 20:08.875
Suicide note. His name is Walker,
but we haven't made him yet.

20:08.959 --> 20:13.797
And he's not talking, other than to say
he's gonna go off in about two minutes.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.716
Two minutes.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.135
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.886
- He ask for help?
- No.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.222
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.474
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.853
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.610
One minute!

20:36.153 --> 20:39.114
Coffee? Please. Don't make me beg.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.617
You got it. But time is a-wastin'.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.662
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.124
Another rough night, huh?

20:57.299 --> 20:58.717
10 seconds!

21:02.262 --> 21:04.014
Let's go. Tick-took.

21:04.598 --> 21:05.849
Five!

21:08.101 --> 21:09.311
Four!

21:10.687 --> 21:11.897
Three!

21:12.606 --> 21:14.191
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?

21:16.151 --> 21:18.862
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.075
What brings you out here today?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.660
Aside from the view?

21:27.078 --> 21:30.248
Trust me,
this staring off into the abyss stuff...

21:31.583 --> 21:32.751
It's no good.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.882
Today is the day that everything changes.

21:39.925 --> 21:41.301
One way or another.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.137
What's gonna change?

21:47.849 --> 21:49.226
I'm ready to die.

21:50.685 --> 21:54.314
It's important to me that
you understand that.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.441
I understand.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.570
Oh, yeah.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.658
Why me, Mr. Walker?

22:05.325 --> 22:06.326
Hmm?

22:06.409 --> 22:08.745
If you're really ready to die,
why'd you bring me up here?

22:09.663 --> 22:10.747
You're famous.

22:13.124 --> 22:16.211
Last month you were with a jumper
on a bridge,

22:17.045 --> 22:18.755
and he died with the whole world watching.

22:20.006 --> 22:24.344
I just wanted to know that I could get
a good crowd for when I go off.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.101
Wow.

22:31.810 --> 22:35.605
Really nice work. Very impressive.

22:35.689 --> 22:38.191
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.360
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.613
My scene. My room. Get out.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.742
You heard her, guys. Let's go.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.787
Way to keep your cool. Nicely done.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.331
I'll give you five minutes.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.721
We're getting a lot of static
from the store owners.

23:07.804 --> 23:11.433
Do I care? I mean, get more crowd control,
all right. Don't break my balls about this.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.184
The street stays closed
till I say it's safe.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.775
You got any friends or family
you want me to call for you?

23:20.859 --> 23:22.152
No.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.073
My father's dead.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.492
Is that why you're out here?

23:30.327 --> 23:31.411
In a way.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.164
Do you want to talk about it?

23:35.373 --> 23:37.500
You know, this job of yours...

23:38.627 --> 23:40.795
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.964
I prefer to focus on the people I help.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.134
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.193
You got a lot of friends on the force?

24:05.528 --> 24:06.529
Enough.

24:10.909 --> 24:14.913
I bet you're not too popular
with the boys' club.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.545
<i>Yeah, it's him. No doubt.</i>

24:22.629 --> 24:24.631
- Anything at JFK?
<i>- No.</i>

24:24.714 --> 24:26.049
Anything at the borders?

24:26.132 --> 24:28.009
<i>No, he's not gonna make
a mistake like that.</i>

24:28.093 --> 24:30.220
- Tom, listen.
<i>- Yeah, what?</i>

24:31.471 --> 24:35.475
I want you to look through all
the cell phone and credit card records.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.477
Nick and Joey Cassidy.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.145
<i>Okay. Right.</i>

24:39.229 --> 24:42.482
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.

24:42.565 --> 24:43.566
<i>All right.</i>

24:43.650 --> 24:44.901
I want to find him first.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.697
I'd sure appreciate it
if you kept the gloves on.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.116
Five minutes up already, huh?

24:51.741 --> 24:56.454
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up. Are you in or out?

24:57.789 --> 25:00.750
In or out? I'm in.

25:01.584 --> 25:02.752
Let's go, guys.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.879
I'll tell you what, Monica.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.631
<i>Uh-huh. I'm listening.</i>

25:06.715 --> 25:11.302
I'll host a dinner for the Gold
Circle patrons and their families.

25:11.386 --> 25:15.432
<i>David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.</i>

25:15.515 --> 25:19.352
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
<i>- Right. Yeah.</i>

25:19.436 --> 25:21.438
I mean, in this economy,
that's the least I could do.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.356
<i>You're a dream. I knew I could count on you</i>

25:23.440 --> 25:24.858
- Yeah. Of course.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

25:24.941 --> 25:26.609
Okay. Good. Bye.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.154
Mr. Henry is here, sir.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.864
What is it, Ted?

25:30.947 --> 25:32.032
There's a problem.

25:32.407 --> 25:35.702
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.121
It's the councilman.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.793
It's too much of a risk
if they tie that money to me.

25:44.335 --> 25:49.174
Look. I'll talk to Frank,
see if he has someone who can...

25:51.342 --> 25:54.137
David, please.

25:55.346 --> 25:58.808
- What's this?
- It's a gift. I'm sorry.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.728
Oh.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.440
You know, when I sold my first building,

26:05.523 --> 26:08.735
the bank sent over four hookers,
a pound of cocaine,

26:08.818 --> 26:11.488
and then they flew us all to Paris
on their private jet.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.740
Now that was a gift.

26:16.868 --> 26:19.162
Tell me it's done, Ted. Hmm?

26:19.913 --> 26:22.499
Tell me it's done!

26:26.294 --> 26:27.378
Thank you for the watch.

26:31.883 --> 26:35.762
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?

26:35.845 --> 26:37.639
240 bucks for breakfast?

26:37.722 --> 26:40.350
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.851
Anything else unusual you noticed?

26:44.354 --> 26:46.189
He's got honest eyes.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.275
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.

26:49.359 --> 26:52.028
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.

26:52.654 --> 26:53.780
They did the whole place?

26:54.489 --> 26:55.615
A little strange, don't you think?

26:56.866 --> 26:57.909
Tell Mercer.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.869
Yeah, be my pleasure.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.560
Hey. You want a smoke?

27:24.936 --> 27:25.979
No.

27:27.522 --> 27:29.899
- Mr. Walker...
- What?

27:31.609 --> 27:33.862
I know you're desperate. I can see that.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.032
But I also know this
isn't a normal suicide.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.120
I don't know what's going on here.

27:42.203 --> 27:46.040
But I can tell you, these people down here,
they don't care about you.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.459
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.044
But I do care.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.589
<i>Nick, can you hear me?</i>

27:53.423 --> 27:55.008
<i>Is this thing working yet?</i>

27:55.091 --> 27:57.594
And I'm asking you to help me understand
what's going on.

27:58.428 --> 28:00.847
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.

28:05.602 --> 28:08.396
I asked for you, because I needed someone
I could count on.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.649
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are,
this ain't gonna end well.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.902
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.

28:13.985 --> 28:18.072
My choice? My only choice is easy.
All right? To jump or not to jump.

28:18.156 --> 28:21.618
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.

28:27.874 --> 28:28.917
You're late!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.668
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.

28:32.795 --> 28:36.925
Yeah. And you're the one person
in Manhattan who knew it would be.

28:39.427 --> 28:40.845
You ready?

28:42.305 --> 28:43.723
All right, let's go.

28:43.973 --> 28:48.561
<i>In breaking news, we have just learned that
the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.</i>

28:48.645 --> 28:51.439
- Are you kidding me with this?
<i>- As you may recall, she was widely criticized</i>

28:51.522 --> 28:53.274
<i>for her questionable handling...</i>
- What? It's the news.

28:53.358 --> 28:56.402
<i>...of last month's tragic incident
on the Brooklyn Bridge,</i>

28:56.486 --> 28:59.030
<i>where a young officer lost his life.</i>

28:59.113 --> 29:01.824
<i>- One has to wonder about her suitability...</i>
- I'm sorry. Roy, turn that off.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.326
I hate this bitch.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.954
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?

29:08.373 --> 29:10.917
I don't sleep since that happened.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.545
It replays over and over in my mind.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.634
I understand. I'm sorry.

29:24.555 --> 29:28.434
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?

29:28.518 --> 29:30.436
Obviously somebody with a history, right?

29:30.937 --> 29:33.523
Why don't I have the guys
go look at some mug shots?

29:33.606 --> 29:35.525
And you get back to the EDP.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.695
The investors are running
about 30 minutes behind.

29:38.778 --> 29:42.490
There's a jumper on the building
and traffic's a mess.

29:44.075 --> 29:47.036
Why don't these people
just shoot themselves in the head?

29:49.831 --> 29:52.292
Overnight time locks go down
in two minutes.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.793
Would you try and relax?

29:53.876 --> 29:57.213
<i>- Everything's in place.</i>
- Yeah? Everything but you.

29:57.672 --> 29:59.215
Angie, grab this.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.012
Catch.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.515
How you doing way up there?

30:10.268 --> 30:14.063
Hey, Angie. Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.412
Anyone who creates traffic like this
in Midtown should be shot.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.956
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.918
Are you hoping he jumps
in time for the morning shows?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.754
- No!
- I give him an hour.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.383
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.846
Make it $100. Let's go.

31:07.075 --> 31:08.284
Hey, you see me?

31:11.621 --> 31:13.289
Yeah. I gotcha.

31:13.623 --> 31:14.791
Don't worry.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.795
Everyone's looking at me.

31:19.670 --> 31:22.840
They were saying on the news
you're headed for Canada.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.425
It couldn't have gone better.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.969
You could have pulled
your punches a little.

31:27.470 --> 31:29.847
Yeah? It's been a rough couple years.

31:31.349 --> 31:32.725
Tell me about it.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.025
<i>Switching comms, hold on.</i>

31:42.985 --> 31:44.112
Ten seconds.

31:45.655 --> 31:46.948
- Really?
- Eight.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.282
- What?
- Seven.

31:48.366 --> 31:50.326
- You're doing that now?
<i>- Six.</i>

31:50.827 --> 31:53.830
Five, four...

32:06.592 --> 32:08.428
The night locks should be deactivated.

32:32.493 --> 32:33.953
That's all good.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.040
- Hey, listen. This is your last chance.
- No.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.292
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!

32:39.375 --> 32:41.127
No, listen. For me it's
family, and for Nick.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.004
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.

32:43.087 --> 32:46.048
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.

32:46.841 --> 32:47.884
All right.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.387
Besides, you'd probably screw this up
without me.

32:51.471 --> 32:53.306
Don't say that. No one's screwing this up.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.309
I know. I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.482
- Ready?
- Huh?

33:02.565 --> 33:04.734
- Ready?
- Yeah.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.654
It's your show, bro.

33:17.455 --> 33:18.581
Look at all these people.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.793
Oh, can't disappoint them.

33:23.461 --> 33:25.087
- Hey, what are you doing? No!
- Three...

33:25.171 --> 33:26.506
Hey! Look at me!

33:26.589 --> 33:27.924
- Walker! Look at me!
- Two...

33:29.175 --> 33:30.760
- One!
- Don't!

33:36.432 --> 33:38.476
Why don't you jump
and get it over with?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.818
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.058
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.982
Nerves of steel.

34:26.857 --> 34:28.734
Think I might need that cigarette now.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.280
Last one. Do you mind sharing?

34:50.339 --> 34:53.134
I can imagine how it must have felt
after that cop jumped.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.513
Cops are superstitious.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.224
And they would've run from you
like the plague.

35:01.309 --> 35:02.935
Are you speaking from experience?

35:04.812 --> 35:06.480
But you never quit.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.149
Never.

35:08.232 --> 35:12.903
Last year, you did 68 hours straight
in a hostage negotiation.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.239
You got everyone out.

35:15.323 --> 35:18.075
You trusted your instincts. You never quit.
You never gave up.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.036
Why do you know so much about me?

35:22.496 --> 35:24.248
Because you and I have a lot in common.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.419
I don't think you wanna jump.

35:31.464 --> 35:34.258
Is there a moment when you can tell

35:34.342 --> 35:35.843
if someone's gonna go off or not?

35:36.886 --> 35:38.721
Sometimes you know.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.932
Sometimes you can feel them give up.

35:49.857 --> 35:51.400
Don't give up on me.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.155
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.

36:00.743 --> 36:02.745
Since when do you smoke?

36:04.246 --> 36:05.623
See if you can get a partial.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.918
Nice work.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.551
Hey, Nick.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.011
<i>We're in, buddy.</i>

36:39.365 --> 36:42.535
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.

37:03.347 --> 37:06.726
<i>This is Suzie Morales reporting live
from Midtown.</i>

37:06.809 --> 37:10.479
<i>Someone in this country commits suicide
every 17 minutes...</i>

37:10.563 --> 37:12.314
- What's going on?
- Jumper.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.692
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.

37:14.775 --> 37:19.280
It's money. Women jump for love.
Men? We jump for money.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.823
Fricking economy.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.660
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.

37:46.807 --> 37:47.892
Is that a photo?

37:52.313 --> 37:53.314
Of your dad?

37:53.898 --> 37:54.940
Yeah.

37:55.858 --> 37:56.984
He always stood by me.

37:58.277 --> 38:01.238
Even when nothing made sense,
he stood by me.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.532
People like that are rare.

38:05.034 --> 38:08.579
Why don't you come in and tell me
about him? Where it's safer.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.122
- Just the two of us.
- No.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.999
That's not gonna happen.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.127
Things will get better.

38:23.719 --> 38:26.096
<i>We're just gonna move in
for a closer shot.</i>

38:26.555 --> 38:28.682
Boys, get this chopper out of here!

38:32.228 --> 38:33.312
Nick! Hold on!

38:33.395 --> 38:34.814
Marcus!
What's going on up there?

38:34.897 --> 38:35.898
Hang on! Hang on!

38:35.981 --> 38:37.733
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!

38:38.108 --> 38:39.360
Are you kidding me?

38:39.443 --> 38:40.986
<i>Who is the man on the ledge?</i>

38:41.070 --> 38:43.739
<i>And what drove him to such a desperate act?</i>

38:44.740 --> 38:45.783
<i>Well, there's one thing for sure,</i>

38:45.866 --> 38:47.910
<i>he has captured the attention
of the entire city.</i>

38:49.119 --> 38:52.832
<i>For our next segment we are going to talk
to a forensic psychiatrist</i>

38:52.915 --> 38:55.334
<i>who may be able to shed some light...</i>
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?

38:55.417 --> 38:57.503
<i>There's a storage unit
in the brother's name.</i>

38:57.586 --> 38:58.879
Storage?

38:59.755 --> 39:01.006
You got a location?

39:06.428 --> 39:07.513
Are you all right?

39:07.596 --> 39:08.597
You want me to trust you?

39:08.681 --> 39:10.182
- That wasn't ours! I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?

39:10.266 --> 39:11.308
Come in!

39:30.286 --> 39:32.037
I really hope I didn't need that.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.133
Joey? Joey!

39:44.925 --> 39:47.595
Just give me your hand. Give me your hand.
Come on.

39:48.888 --> 39:50.306
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:53.726 --> 39:55.978
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.939
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.

39:59.023 --> 40:01.483
This guy has that capacity,
but he's not going over.

40:01.984 --> 40:04.778
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking. But what?

40:05.279 --> 40:07.823
It's like he's waiting for something.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.116
We need this ID.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.868
All right. I'll see what I can do.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.465
<i>Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown,</i>

40:24.548 --> 40:28.928
<i>where the eyes of the city
are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up</i>

40:29.011 --> 40:30.554
<i>and the unidentified man...</i>

40:34.892 --> 40:36.727
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?

40:36.810 --> 40:38.020
- Go on!
- Jump!

40:38.103 --> 40:40.439
- Jump! Jump! Jump!
- Jump!

40:40.522 --> 40:42.691
- Jump! Jump!
- Yeah, jump!

40:43.025 --> 40:46.779
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!

40:46.862 --> 40:48.781
Gotta love New York.

40:50.449 --> 40:54.078
Maybe it's time you told me
what's really going on here.

40:56.705 --> 40:58.916
Why don't you want us to know
who you really are?

41:02.544 --> 41:06.256
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?

41:07.549 --> 41:08.926
Start again?

41:47.756 --> 41:49.216
- Okay. We're clear.
- Hey.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.634
How do you know it looks good
on the monitors?

41:57.099 --> 41:58.892
It is so hard for me to love you
when you do that.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.646
- You're so stupid.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.905
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
There's something new here.

42:11.989 --> 42:13.782
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.

42:13.866 --> 42:16.076
It's up on the ceiling. Right there.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.369
- Let me see.
- Hold on.

42:17.453 --> 42:19.163
No, let me see. Let me see.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.165
See?

42:21.623 --> 42:22.666
Back up.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.376
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?

42:24.460 --> 42:25.461
That's a sensor.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.212
- How do you know?
- I know. I just know.

42:30.257 --> 42:32.009
Do you really wanna talk about this
right now?

42:32.092 --> 42:33.719
That depends on what we're talking about,
doesn't it?

42:33.802 --> 42:35.387
Okay, Joey.

42:36.221 --> 42:40.601
In high school, I used to
break into houses sometimes.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.102
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.

42:42.186 --> 42:43.479
That's how I know what that is.

42:43.812 --> 42:45.230
Great. Great, so you were a thief?

42:45.314 --> 42:49.526
No, no, no! I used to watch TV
and try on clothes, you know?

42:49.651 --> 42:52.237
Unless the clothes fit. And that's all.

42:52.321 --> 42:53.739
Is there anything else
you want to tell me about?

42:53.822 --> 42:55.199
You got any felonies you failed to mention?

42:55.282 --> 42:57.743
Excuse me? Take it down a notch. All right?

42:57.826 --> 42:59.912
Because you probably
would've set that shit off.

43:01.580 --> 43:05.084
All right. Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.

43:05.834 --> 43:09.213
<i>If you could be anywhere in the world,
what would you be doing?</i>

43:09.296 --> 43:11.507
Nick, we got something
that isn't on the plans.

43:13.884 --> 43:15.928
<i>Nick? Come in.</i>

43:16.011 --> 43:17.304
Come on, anything.

43:17.763 --> 43:20.307
<i>Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.</i>

43:20.390 --> 43:21.517
What do you mean?

43:22.059 --> 43:24.311
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.

43:25.354 --> 43:30.400
Like, if it was me,
I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.

43:31.610 --> 43:32.611
Tell me about it.

43:32.694 --> 43:33.737
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.

43:33.821 --> 43:37.116
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling
about 4 inches across.

43:37.199 --> 43:40.244
It's this little Italian
joint in the Bronx.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.996
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.207
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.

43:47.042 --> 43:50.838
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying? I need an answer here.

43:50.921 --> 43:54.258
Listen. This thing that we got here.

43:55.884 --> 43:57.261
I think we should cool it down

43:57.845 --> 43:59.304
<i>before you get into trouble.</i>

43:59.388 --> 44:01.306
Look, Nicky. Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.

44:01.390 --> 44:02.641
We're sweating down here. What is it?

44:02.724 --> 44:04.101
This thing?

44:04.560 --> 44:05.644
I'm just looking out for you.

44:06.145 --> 44:07.563
Is she hot?

44:08.230 --> 44:10.482
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.

44:10.566 --> 44:12.067
We have to cool it down.

44:12.151 --> 44:13.735
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.

44:13.819 --> 44:15.154
- Cool it down.
- Yes.

44:15.237 --> 44:19.408
Why don't you come in this window
and I'll let you take me to lunch?

44:19.741 --> 44:21.285
It's tempting.

44:22.202 --> 44:23.579
But I don't think it's a good idea.

44:23.787 --> 44:25.414
You got someplace better to be?

44:26.540 --> 44:27.583
If I'm right,

44:29.918 --> 44:34.089
that print you pulled off
our cigarette's about to come through.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.966
What's it gonna tell me?

44:56.195 --> 44:57.362
Bags.

45:29.186 --> 45:30.854
Son of a bitch.

45:42.991 --> 45:45.327
<i>- Listen up.</i>
- Go.

45:45.410 --> 45:48.580
<i>Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.</i>

45:48.997 --> 45:50.415
Nick Cassidy.

45:53.001 --> 45:56.255
Cassidy. The cop that stole the diamond
off David Englander?

45:56.338 --> 45:57.756
The $40 million diamond.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.217
I knew I recognized this mutt.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.636
Englander owns this hotel.

46:03.095 --> 46:06.473
His office is here. His Jewelry Exchange is
right across the street.

46:06.932 --> 46:10.352
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?

46:11.353 --> 46:13.480
- "I will exit as I entered..."
- "Innocent".

46:13.563 --> 46:16.900
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.

46:16.984 --> 46:19.778
I think he's more interested
in just having an audience.

46:19.861 --> 46:21.530
Son of a bitch.

46:21.613 --> 46:24.908
Pull his file. Find his family.
Toss his cell.

46:24.992 --> 46:26.159
Who'd he ride with?

46:26.660 --> 46:28.245
Mike Ackerman.

46:31.373 --> 46:32.541
Jesus.

46:34.543 --> 46:36.169
I can't believe this.

46:37.462 --> 46:38.505
How's he doing?

46:38.964 --> 46:42.718
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.

46:42.801 --> 46:44.803
He always insisted he was innocent.

46:44.886 --> 46:46.722
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

46:46.805 --> 46:49.808
Look, he was my partner for five years.

46:49.891 --> 46:52.227
So do you think he would jump?

46:52.894 --> 46:54.521
He's got nothing to lose.

46:57.733 --> 46:59.568
I'm on my way.

47:02.696 --> 47:04.323
First Line Security. This is Nestor.

47:04.406 --> 47:07.409
Yeah, Nestor. This is Detective Marcus
over at the Roosevelt Hotel.

47:07.868 --> 47:10.162
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.

47:10.245 --> 47:11.705
- Detective...
<i>- Right now.</i>

47:23.633 --> 47:25.844
That's it, baby. Chisel.

47:33.935 --> 47:35.187
Hello, everybody.

47:36.271 --> 47:37.522
I'm glad you could make it.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.735
I wish my dad could see this.

47:42.444 --> 47:44.321
He was an immigrant.

47:44.404 --> 47:46.865
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.

47:46.948 --> 47:52.287
So he was more than a little anxious when
I decided to risk it all in real estate.

47:54.331 --> 47:58.668
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.

47:58.752 --> 48:00.295
To honor him.

48:03.256 --> 48:07.302
You know, three years ago,
when the market tanked,

48:07.386 --> 48:09.346
they said we were finished.

48:10.389 --> 48:12.140
- Remember?
- Yeah.

48:12.224 --> 48:14.851
But that's what's great about this country.

48:14.935 --> 48:18.730
If you want it bad enough,
you can make it back. Hmm?

48:18.897 --> 48:19.898
True.

48:19.981 --> 48:22.526
In this city, on this island,

48:23.485 --> 48:25.362
we don't go to work,

48:26.196 --> 48:28.490
- we go to war.
- Yes!

48:28.573 --> 48:31.326
And if somebody takes something from you,

48:31.410 --> 48:33.328
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!

48:33.412 --> 48:34.538
And more.

48:39.876 --> 48:42.754
I had one precious jewel taken from me
a few years ago.

48:44.089 --> 48:49.010
But now I've got another
that no one will ever steal from me.

48:49.761 --> 48:52.889
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.

48:53.682 --> 48:56.518
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!

48:56.601 --> 48:58.895
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.

48:58.979 --> 49:00.647
You pulled it off.

49:00.730 --> 49:02.941
Excuse me, sir. They've ID'd the jumper.

49:03.024 --> 49:05.527
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.

49:08.447 --> 49:10.031
Nick Cassidy.

49:11.158 --> 49:12.367
Convicted felon.

49:13.118 --> 49:15.454
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.

49:15.537 --> 49:18.373
I'm just curious,
does this little show have a point?

49:18.457 --> 49:21.376
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt
your suicidal tendencies.

49:21.460 --> 49:25.338
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be
sending a team across the street right now.

49:25.422 --> 49:28.300
Hold on! Nick, we're not ready yet!

49:28.383 --> 49:29.968
<i>Yeah, right now.</i>

49:30.051 --> 49:32.637
<i>Are you having fun
jerking me around?</i>

49:32.846 --> 49:34.139
Are you trying to manipulate me?

49:34.222 --> 49:35.432
No!

49:35.724 --> 49:39.478
Two years ago, I'm doing a
moonlighting gig. Real simple.

49:39.561 --> 49:42.606
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua
with the Monarch Diamond.

49:42.689 --> 49:46.193
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years
for apparently stealing it.

49:46.276 --> 49:50.572
And today? Today I'm putting it all
on the damn line. And I need your help.

49:51.490 --> 49:52.657
You are nuts.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.993
You care, remember?

49:55.285 --> 49:56.536
You played this all wrong, Nick.

50:03.585 --> 50:05.378
David Englander set me up.

50:05.462 --> 50:07.881
You could've been sipping tequila
on a beach in Mexico.

50:09.216 --> 50:10.675
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

50:10.759 --> 50:13.136
Looking over your shoulder,
sleeping with one eye open.

50:13.220 --> 50:14.304
That isn't freedom.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.431
Standing here
in front of all these TV cameras is?

50:16.640 --> 50:18.767
No one is gonna shoot me
with their grandmother watching.

50:22.354 --> 50:24.105
Maybe you should tell me
the rest of your plan.

50:24.189 --> 50:26.900
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.

50:27.234 --> 50:29.027
And this? This is my retrial.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.445
I'm innocent!

50:34.908 --> 50:37.035
I'm an innocent man!

50:37.118 --> 50:39.538
Did you get that, Lydia? I'm innocent!

50:39.621 --> 50:43.375
Now you go downstairs and tell your
bosses that I'm not going back.

50:43.458 --> 50:46.044
Can you do that for me? Tell me, Lydia.

50:47.546 --> 50:48.964
Yeah, Nick.

50:49.506 --> 50:50.966
I'll go do that.

50:54.469 --> 50:55.971
Here they come. Party of four.

50:56.304 --> 50:57.973
Let 'em through. Make way.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.059
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back! Stay back!

51:09.651 --> 51:11.194
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.

51:12.362 --> 51:13.405
Okay.

51:16.992 --> 51:18.034
Come on. Come on.

51:23.456 --> 51:24.499
Let's make it rain.

51:26.751 --> 51:27.836
You can't cross here.

51:31.339 --> 51:32.674
What is that?

51:33.842 --> 51:35.093
It's money!

51:36.511 --> 51:38.638
I love this guy!

51:42.726 --> 51:45.228
Make way! Make way!

51:53.778 --> 51:56.823
- That's the entrance.
- Got it. Yeah. Got it.

52:01.119 --> 52:02.996
Here. Take the camera.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.623
Right here. Right here.

52:18.511 --> 52:21.806
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

52:22.724 --> 52:23.767
They're animals!

52:25.518 --> 52:29.064
- I can't get it. It won't stay!
- Get the gear! Get the gear.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.277
- Keep out of the way! Out of the way!
- Move!

52:34.361 --> 52:35.904
Get out of here!

52:45.246 --> 52:47.082
How are you doing, babe?

52:47.165 --> 52:48.750
It won't stick!

52:48.833 --> 52:50.585
Just take a breath! You can do it.

52:52.587 --> 52:55.048
I need you guys to turn around.

53:00.095 --> 53:01.179
All right. We're good.

53:02.722 --> 53:03.807
Joey, they're in.

53:03.890 --> 53:06.518
Go! Go! Go! We gotta go!

53:17.946 --> 53:19.406
<i>Joey, talk to me.</i>

53:29.999 --> 53:31.668
Go! Go! Go!

53:39.718 --> 53:41.344
Disarm 15, lobby.

53:51.479 --> 53:52.772
Come on.

53:54.649 --> 53:55.692
Hallway sensors.

54:13.668 --> 54:16.087
What is the son of a bitch
doing on my building?

54:16.171 --> 54:17.213
I don't know, Mr. Englander,

54:17.297 --> 54:19.174
but I can assure you
the situation's completely under control.

54:19.758 --> 54:21.009
- Under control?
- Yeah.

54:21.092 --> 54:22.510
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.

54:22.594 --> 54:25.305
It's no accident that
this is happening today.

54:25.388 --> 54:27.098
I've got a major press conference
in two hours.

54:27.182 --> 54:30.602
The only place that Cassidy's going
is back into custody or splat on 45th.

54:30.685 --> 54:33.146
This is a goddamned embarrassment.

54:33.354 --> 54:35.231
You wrap this up now,
or tomorrow you're sucking fumes

54:35.315 --> 54:37.442
on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?

54:40.528 --> 54:41.696
Yeah.

54:43.948 --> 54:46.451
Nina! Get me the Mayor's office.

54:49.996 --> 54:53.291
This is where Englander
entertains the high-rollers.

54:58.213 --> 55:02.467
1-9-6-7, pound.

55:04.844 --> 55:06.387
Disarm the vault room.

55:21.903 --> 55:24.155
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.

55:24.239 --> 55:27.325
And over there we've got light sensors
and body-heat sensors.

55:27.408 --> 55:30.328
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.

55:30.411 --> 55:31.496
It's all clear.

55:31.579 --> 55:34.082
Nobody's getting into that beast.

55:34.165 --> 55:35.250
After you, gentlemen.

55:37.836 --> 55:39.754
- Yeah?

55:40.296 --> 55:43.258
It's Nestor. Englander's
is clear, Detective.

55:43.341 --> 55:46.344
<i>Good. I don't need that son of a bitch
crawling up my ass any more.</i>

55:46.427 --> 55:47.554
Roger that.

55:59.482 --> 56:00.775
Let's go.

56:02.569 --> 56:03.903
Mercer.

56:07.115 --> 56:08.867
Why is tactical here?

56:08.950 --> 56:11.160
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.

56:12.996 --> 56:14.831
So where are we at?

56:14.914 --> 56:17.542
He is acting
like he really believes that he's innocent.

56:17.625 --> 56:19.043
Yeah? What's that make him?

56:19.127 --> 56:21.379
An honest man or a sociopath.

56:21.629 --> 56:25.466
He ain't an honest man. And I'm gonna
put an end to this show out here.

56:25.592 --> 56:27.385
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.

56:28.469 --> 56:29.470
He likes me.

56:29.554 --> 56:31.806
Marcus, give her a little more time.

56:32.473 --> 56:36.144
You have 15 minutes,
then I'm sending tactical. You got it?

56:36.519 --> 56:37.645
Lutz?

57:10.970 --> 57:12.931
Let's go, thief!

57:13.014 --> 57:15.391
You sure there's nothing else
you wanna tell me?

57:18.102 --> 57:19.604
Come on. Move! Come on!

57:24.025 --> 57:25.526
Shit!

57:27.946 --> 57:29.238
Come on!

57:34.702 --> 57:36.829
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.

57:37.830 --> 57:40.249
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.

57:40.333 --> 57:41.751
Sure I do.

57:41.834 --> 57:43.503
Boyfriends?

57:43.586 --> 57:45.088
Girlfriends?

57:46.798 --> 57:48.424
Best sex of my life?

57:48.508 --> 57:50.718
Well... Obviously.

57:53.888 --> 57:55.640
Okay, wait. Hold on a sec.

58:01.354 --> 58:05.024
<i>The Monarch Diamond was
most recently held by David Englander</i>

58:05.108 --> 58:08.820
<i>until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy,
the man on the ledge,</i>

58:08.903 --> 58:12.949
<i>who was said to have cut it up
into untraceable pieces and sold it.</i>

58:26.087 --> 58:28.715
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.

58:29.090 --> 58:30.425
Oh, man.

58:31.384 --> 58:32.969
Time is running out here, Nick.

58:33.052 --> 58:36.097
Tactical's on the scene
and I am tired of being played.

58:36.180 --> 58:40.351
How far would you go to take down a man
that stole everything from you? Huh?

58:40.435 --> 58:41.978
Your honor.

58:42.603 --> 58:46.107
Your family. What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.

58:46.649 --> 58:51.446
After I drove him to Chappaqua,
two of his thugs, guys in masks,

58:51.696 --> 58:53.740
knocked me out
while he just stood there and smiled.

58:53.823 --> 58:55.575
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.

58:55.658 --> 58:57.660
And neither did my lawyer.

58:57.744 --> 59:01.539
And I have spent two years
banging my head against a brick wall,

59:01.914 --> 59:05.918
'cause I know that the Monarch
never left his hand.

59:06.002 --> 59:08.546
Why would Englander
steal his own diamond?

59:08.629 --> 59:13.801
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.

59:13.885 --> 59:15.636
He was that close to being bankrupt.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.139
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.

59:18.222 --> 59:22.310
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't
want to be humiliated. He's too damn proud.

59:22.935 --> 59:25.271
Two weeks after my conviction,

59:25.354 --> 59:28.274
Lloyd's of London sent him a check
for 40 million for a claim.

59:28.357 --> 59:30.485
And, poof! He's back.

59:30.568 --> 59:33.446
Come on. I need you to believe me.

59:35.823 --> 59:37.825
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?

59:39.202 --> 59:43.206
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.

59:47.668 --> 59:48.711
Cops?

59:49.754 --> 59:52.465
You know what it's like
to have everyone turn their back on you.

59:52.548 --> 59:54.509
Even those closest to you.

59:55.676 --> 59:59.055
Today is the day that
you can really save someone.

01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:01.182
Please.

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:10.942
If you are lying to me about any of this,
I'm gonna push you off myself.

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:15.196
Watch him.

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:18.616
You're getting a little too comfortable
barking orders.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.089
What's up?

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:34.298
How's he doing?

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:35.925
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.

01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:37.260
Is he talking?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.554
You know what, Mikey?

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:44.350
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the
wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.061
I've got some papers
from his cell in Sing Sing.

01:00:47.395 --> 01:00:48.729
Take 'em up to Dougherty.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:50.106
Let me see those.

01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:59.073
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.711
Angie, Angie, Angie.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.254
What?

01:01:14.005 --> 01:01:15.131
You're moving artwork, girl.

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:24.348
So what was the best sex of your life?

01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:27.185
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:30.438
Well, there was this one
guy in high school.

01:01:31.439 --> 01:01:34.609
He was older. He had these hands...

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:38.446
Don't even mess with me. Yeah? Let's go.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.697
When was that?

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.283
<i>- A week after the heist.</i>
- Did I have anything?

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:45.745
<i>Everyone expected indictments,
but the case fell apart.</i>

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:47.288
- That's great.
<i>- That's all I got.</i>

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.248
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:54.295
Are we sure nothing's happening
across the street?

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:56.547
You can't steal something twice.

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:59.300
Especially if it's been cut
into a million pieces.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:00.468
What if he didn't do it?

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:02.053
Please, Mercer.

01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:06.724
- Marcus?
- Go.

01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:10.394
What if there were other cops involved
in this Englander thing?

01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:12.980
If you're trying to get yourself
even more despised within the department,

01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:15.274
<i>I'd say you're really on to something.</i>

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:18.486
I just found out Cassidy
was cooperating with IA.

01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:20.571
About what?

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:23.574
You remember when somebody disappeared
about a million bucks' worth of cocaine

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:24.742
out of evidence?

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:28.120
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.

01:02:28.204 --> 01:02:32.792
<i>And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker
and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.</i>

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.794
Yeah. He had a blood alcohol level of .23.

01:02:34.877 --> 01:02:37.338
<i>Why don't you stop while you're behind?</i>

01:02:37.964 --> 01:02:41.842
Whoever was in it with Walker
had every reason to set Cassidy up.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:44.929
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:47.765
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge
to say goodbye.

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:48.891
Yeah? What's he saying?

01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:50.810
"Fuck you."

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.274
- Lutz. Get your people into position. Now!
- Roger that.

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:57.775
Okay. It's game time, gentlemen.

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:12.290
- Let's go. Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:15.209
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:17.712
Pouch. Headset.

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:19.588
Headset.

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.551
Let's go, go, go.

01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:25.344
Piece of cake, right?

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:33.477
- No.
- No? What do you mean, no?

01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:35.354
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.

01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:37.690
You can't hold my weight. All right?

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:39.066
We don't have time to talk about this.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.861
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:44.655
Nick will kill you? I'm gonna kill you.

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:47.033
Be mad. Just be mad in the vent.

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:50.077
Get out of here.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.413
Did I stutter?

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:13.976
You see that? You see that?

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.687
This is what happens
when a man gets pushed too far!

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:19.648
Right? It's always the little guy
who takes the hit!

01:04:19.732 --> 01:04:21.901
There's no rich guys in prison.

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:24.737
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!

01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.199
<i>Nick Cassidy has always
maintained his innocence.</i>

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:30.618
<i>Do you believe he actually stole
the Monarch Diamond?</i>

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:33.454
<i>I hope he did. I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?</i>

01:04:35.206 --> 01:04:38.042
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty. Welcome to the party.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.086
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.

01:04:40.169 --> 01:04:41.796
Hi. Lydia Mercer.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.714
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.

01:04:43.798 --> 01:04:45.925
You ever moonlight for Englander,
or was it just Nick?

01:04:48.094 --> 01:04:49.762
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:04:49.845 --> 01:04:53.015
Was it a Joe Walker
who set that detail up for you guys?

01:04:55.226 --> 01:04:56.894
- So what?
- So he did?

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:59.980
I didn't say he did. I said, "So what?"

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.025
You're not getting near him.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.069
That's my friend out there.

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:06.404
And this is my scene.

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:09.824
Dougherty? Will you talk to her?

01:05:10.366 --> 01:05:12.827
Look, man. It's the lady's call.

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:16.288
We will call you if we need you.

01:05:26.257 --> 01:05:28.175
Thank you.

01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:31.512
You better know what the hell you're doing.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.847
And what's this?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.766
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.310
How are you doing, kid?

01:05:44.442 --> 01:05:46.735
I'm hanging in there.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.871
Bon appétit.

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:18.809
How are you doing in there, babe?

01:06:30.196 --> 01:06:31.322
I can't do it.

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:34.825
What? Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now. Come on.

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:38.287
Don't panic, Angie. It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:40.080
Yeah!

01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:55.679
Listen to this. They're
all cheering for you.

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:57.806
<i>They're all on our side, Angie.</i>

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.063
Yeah!

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.322
Yeah!

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:28.671
I'm in.

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:30.548
Good.

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.259
Just relax.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:36.136
Keep it together.

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:41.141
Let's do this thing fast,
before the heat sensor catches up with you.

01:07:42.768 --> 01:07:43.811
Ah!

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.565
Light as a feather.

01:07:48.566 --> 01:07:49.775
I heard that!

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:51.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:08.419
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:09.795
I can't yet.

01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:12.464
The whole world knows
who you are now, Nick.

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:15.593
You've inspired every reporter
to look into your story.

01:08:15.676 --> 01:08:18.095
If you're innocent, it'll come out.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:20.973
And if I go back into custody,
they're gonna kill me.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.018
Nick! Don't leave me hanging here.

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:29.189
Look. I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.737
I trusted that cop.

01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:38.448
On the bridge.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.950
I thought I had him wired.

01:08:42.286 --> 01:08:44.622
I was supposed to be relieved,

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:47.082
but I stayed on, because I knew.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.627
Only then,

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.881
suddenly I didn't know.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.051
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.471
Give me more time.

01:09:02.765 --> 01:09:04.308
Hey, Mercer.

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:11.231
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:16.403
He had bomb schematics in his cell.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.788
Angie, it's me.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:28.916
Okay, what do you see?

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:31.960
I see a mass of wires

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.755
coming out of a circuit board.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.174
Okay, now find the main processor.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.094
It'll look like a big low building.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.761
<i>- You got it?</i>
- Got it.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.971
- I got it.
- Okay.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:47.935
Like you practiced, we're gonna short
it out to take out the sensors.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.145
First, cut the red wire.

01:09:53.816 --> 01:09:55.275
Red wire?

01:09:55.776 --> 01:09:57.194
They're all red wire.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.616
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.910
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:06.662
<i>Shut up. Just listen to me.</i>

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:09.498
If you out the wrong one,
all hell is gonna break loose.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:17.423
Come on, babe. Come on, baby.

01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:39.153
<i>- Done.</i>

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:42.072
Whoo!

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:43.824
Good girl.

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:49.455
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.

01:10:50.122 --> 01:10:51.999
Okay, that sounds easy enough.

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.959
<i>- It might spark a bit.</i>
- Ah!

01:10:56.378 --> 01:10:57.504
Angie!

01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:00.716
Angie?

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.096
Angie?

01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:07.973
Do you hear me?

01:11:14.605 --> 01:11:18.734
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:22.279
<i>I can now confirm that the bomb squad
has just arrived on the scene</i>

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:26.575
<i>and tactical units are on their way up
to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:29.328
<i>Time is running out for
this escaped criminal.</i>

01:11:52.184 --> 01:11:53.310
Is there a bomb?

01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:58.273
You asked for my trust, and then this.

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.110
Well, this is the moment
you make your choice. Remember?

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:04.988
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.

01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:07.616
It's your call.

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.662
Stand down, Mercer.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.833
He will go over before he gets taken down.

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:18.585
That's assuming our track record's
on par with yours.

01:12:27.678 --> 01:12:28.762
All right.

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:34.560
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody
but the negotiator. Clear the building.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:39.356
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall! He's playing you!

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:42.317
He picked you, 'cause you're in
no condition to do your job!

01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.036
This is my scene! My negotiation!

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.039
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there! Now!

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:58.667
Lydia, come on! Clear the window!

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.169
What are you doing?

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:03.630
Hey!

01:13:07.134 --> 01:13:08.260
Hi!

01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:11.638
Jesus Christ!

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.974
All units! This is a hold! Repeat, no go!

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.064
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!

01:13:21.148 --> 01:13:23.191
Stay back! Just shut up!

01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:32.117
Set.

01:13:42.044 --> 01:13:43.128
Moment of truth.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.986
Let's see what we've got.

01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:12.574
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.660
Yeah.

01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:20.415
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing. One thing.

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:26.630
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:29.049
Holy shit.

01:14:30.175 --> 01:14:32.386
Nice and slow. Nice and easy.

01:14:34.012 --> 01:14:35.138
Holy shit!

01:14:35.222 --> 01:14:37.641
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:40.102
We screw up this, it's all our asses.

01:14:40.602 --> 01:14:41.979
Check in these, check in these.

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.570
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.783
It's a possibility. Tell
me there's no bomb.

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:01.623
Do you see the diamond here?

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:04.459
- It's gotta be here! Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.

01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:08.088
Oh, no.

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:10.257
- Hell, no.
- No?

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.259
<i>Hey, Nick.</i>

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:13.802
Just...

01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.221
- Just...
- What?

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:18.390
Joey, talk to me. Tell me what you got.

01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:19.850
Who are you talking to?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.935
Who's Joey?

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.229
I'm stealing the diamond.

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.315
For the first time.

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:29.943
It's not here.

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:33.905
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.

01:15:34.865 --> 01:15:35.991
It's not here.

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:40.996
It's not in the vault.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.540
Oh, shit.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:47.002
Okay, Joey. You know what to do.

01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:50.088
Yeah. Copy that.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:57.721
We need to leave in five minutes
for the press conference, sir.

01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:59.097
Good.

01:16:11.443 --> 01:16:12.652
We've got an alarm at Englander's.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:14.279
Seal the building. No one gets out.

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:17.407
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:19.576
Jesus Christ!

01:16:21.203 --> 01:16:22.996
You're kidding me.

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.678
Get up there. Take a look.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:42.516
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.

01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:56.321
Keep them out of here.

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.713
Guys, give us a second.

01:17:35.443 --> 01:17:36.695
Thank God.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:51.459
- Find them!
- I'm on it.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:57.048
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.009
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:01.136
No, those guys,
they're cautious and paranoid.

01:18:01.219 --> 01:18:04.681
They don't put shit in the file unless
they can prove it six ways to Sunday.

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:06.391
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.

01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:13.023
All right, Marcus, she's
coming back in now.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:16.276
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:18.695
Jesus, Mercer. You got
a giant set of balls.

01:18:18.778 --> 01:18:20.989
They're gonna hang you by 'em,
but they are huge.

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:22.532
Where are we with Internal Affairs?

01:18:22.616 --> 01:18:25.076
Okay. He's expecting your call.

01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:28.330
Internal Affairs. Evans.

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:31.750
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:32.959
Yeah, that's right.

01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:39.591
You should see this.

01:18:40.592 --> 01:18:41.635
What is it?

01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:45.847
Just give me five minutes.

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:49.392
Ackerman, open this door!

01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:53.772
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!

01:18:53.855 --> 01:18:55.565
Hey, partner.

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:59.819
So are you gonna jump or what?

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:08.328
Open the fucking door,
Ackerman!

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.706
Where is everyone? Where's the negotiator?

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:15.794
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?

01:19:16.544 --> 01:19:18.255
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?

01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:20.757
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.425
- What?
- Son of a bitch!

01:19:22.509 --> 01:19:23.760
All right. Call me back. Call me back.

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:26.346
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?

01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:29.766
Let me help you.

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.482
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass. Come in here.

01:19:37.983 --> 01:19:39.359
Cass!

01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:41.945
Let me help you.

01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:43.780
I always wondered
if you were involved in this.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:47.117
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.286
Whose name are they gonna come up with?

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:51.204
I'm your friend. Take my hand.

01:19:51.288 --> 01:19:52.330
Shoot the lock!

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:54.499
All right, guys, clear out.

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:55.709
Whose name?

01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:58.795
What the hell are you doing?

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:00.297
<i>- I'm your friend.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.215
<i>- Get away from me!</i>
- Go! Go! Go!

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.134
Take 'em.

01:20:05.343 --> 01:20:06.428
I'm your friend!

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:07.887
Then why do you look so guilty?

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:16.271
No!

01:20:16.354 --> 01:20:17.439
Oh, no!

01:20:35.415 --> 01:20:36.499
Shit!

01:20:38.293 --> 01:20:40.837
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.

01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:43.840
Get Marcus to call off tactical! Now!

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:46.843
Mercer! Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:49.346
Attica! They're gonna take him down!

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:51.306
Attica! Attica!

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:53.808
- Hey, hey, hey! Paul, get this guy!
- Come on. They can't stop us!

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:55.852
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me. Come with me.

01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:59.230
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay. Sir! Hey, hey, hey!

01:20:59.314 --> 01:21:00.690
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?

01:21:00.774 --> 01:21:03.735
- Sir! Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!

01:21:03.818 --> 01:21:07.989
Lock down floors 21 to 24. Assemble
personnel on 20, with a guest list.

01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:10.950
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.

01:21:11.034 --> 01:21:13.453
Floor by floor, rolling cover.

01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:24.631
Sorry!

01:21:26.674 --> 01:21:27.675
What the...

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.302
LOOK at this.

01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:31.513
- What?
- Heat packs.

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:34.307
That's what tripped the sensor.

01:21:34.391 --> 01:21:36.559
Why would they deliberately
set the alarm off?

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:43.608
This is a nice gun.

01:21:44.401 --> 01:21:47.153
I like it. Looks expensive.

01:21:50.198 --> 01:21:52.867
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.786
I'm the brother.

01:21:54.869 --> 01:21:58.581
The one sitting behind Nick in court
every day for five weeks.

01:21:58.665 --> 01:21:59.707
Remember me now?

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:02.252
How quaint.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.089
And your adorable little Chihuahua.

01:22:07.841 --> 01:22:10.343
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:12.095
Turn around, put your hands on the table.

01:22:14.514 --> 01:22:17.350
Turn around, put your hands on the table.

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.562
Thanks for taking off those last couple
levels of security.

01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:22.439
Nick had you wired.

01:22:23.523 --> 01:22:24.607
There it is.

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.360
Don't move! Don't you move.

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:30.864
Bring down my family. Huh?

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:34.367
You drag 'em through the gutter, then
you think you're gonna get away with it?

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:36.369
Babe, the cuffs.

01:22:38.872 --> 01:22:39.956
This might hurt.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:44.085
Back up. Back against the safe.

01:22:45.128 --> 01:22:46.880
Cuff yourself to it.

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:48.381
Do it!

01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:51.342
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more,

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:52.802
having you killed,

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:57.307
or watching you two suffer
through your pathetic little lives.

01:22:57.891 --> 01:22:59.309
Whatever.

01:23:02.604 --> 01:23:04.230
It's good seeing you, Dave.

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:06.399
- Nina!

01:23:08.276 --> 01:23:09.527
Ackerman!

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:27.170
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:29.172
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.

01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:31.966
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:34.302
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.

01:23:59.327 --> 01:24:01.871
God damn it. What?

01:24:01.955 --> 01:24:04.541
The brother and the girlfriend
have the diamond!

01:24:04.624 --> 01:24:06.376
<i>They're in the goddamned hotel!</i>

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:09.170
Jesus.

01:24:11.923 --> 01:24:13.383
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.

01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:15.301
Take him out. Kill shots.

01:24:15.969 --> 01:24:18.054
- Yeah. Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.807
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:24.269
We knew he had accomplices
and, suddenly, he turns up dead.

01:24:24.352 --> 01:24:26.271
Which, you know, sort of
screwed up the case for us a bit.

01:24:26.354 --> 01:24:29.190
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:33.528
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom,

01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:37.490
but internally we have strong
circumstantial on two other cops.

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:41.035
<i>A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.</i>

01:24:47.667 --> 01:24:49.043
That's him!

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.339
Get out of the way! Go, go!

01:24:55.675 --> 01:24:58.469
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this! Go, go, go!

01:24:58.845 --> 01:25:00.805
Everyone, out of the way! Move!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.101
Where did he go?

01:25:05.852 --> 01:25:06.936
Go this way!

01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:09.397
Are you all right?

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:11.566
Joey Cassidy.

01:25:28.374 --> 01:25:29.584
Room service.

01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:31.836
Room service.

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:34.589
I didn't order any room service.

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:42.472
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!

01:25:47.435 --> 01:25:48.519
Get down!

01:25:51.022 --> 01:25:53.149
- Are you okay?
- Get out!

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.776
Don't move! Stay where you are!

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:57.904
Stay down! Stay down!

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.786
Let me see! I wanna see!

01:26:07.038 --> 01:26:08.039
Oh, my God!

01:26:08.122 --> 01:26:09.207
Look!

01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:11.793
The guy's up there!

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:28.017
It always ends the same,
blood, snot and tears.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:29.894
Now where's the rock, tough guy?

01:26:30.812 --> 01:26:32.522
You hit like a girl.

01:26:32.605 --> 01:26:33.940
Where you from? Jersey?

01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:42.990
I'm from the Bronx.

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:48.996
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.874
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:54.043
Mercer, this is nuts. I have orders.

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:55.753
Your orders are wrong!

01:27:11.102 --> 01:27:12.353
Okay! Okay!

01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:14.814
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:17.316
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire! Guns down!

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.901
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!

01:27:18.985 --> 01:27:21.487
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!

01:27:21.571 --> 01:27:24.073
- Drop your weapons! Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.

01:27:24.157 --> 01:27:26.325
- We got him! We got him!
- Down on your knees!

01:27:26.409 --> 01:27:27.994
Do not drop your hands!

01:27:28.077 --> 01:27:30.037
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay. All right! We got it!

01:27:30.121 --> 01:27:32.165
- It's under control!
- Mercer! Stand down.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:34.125
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:35.543
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.

01:27:35.626 --> 01:27:38.129
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.

01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:39.797
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.

01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:41.382
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.

01:27:41.466 --> 01:27:43.593
What the hell is this? You son of a bitch!

01:27:43.676 --> 01:27:46.095
Yeah, yeah, okay. What are you gonna do?

01:27:46.554 --> 01:27:50.016
We got intel he placed a bomb. I need
you to get your guys back down to 22.

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:54.228
I got this. Let's go. Saddle up! Let's go!

01:28:01.652 --> 01:28:03.112
- We're clear.
- No.

01:28:03.196 --> 01:28:05.323
No! Joey! Joey!

01:28:05.406 --> 01:28:06.532
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:08.326
- I love you. I love you.
- No, no!

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:10.369
I got news for you, pal.

01:28:10.578 --> 01:28:12.455
This is not gonna be okay.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:13.915
Yeah, I know.

01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:24.383
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.

01:28:25.927 --> 01:28:27.053
You're dead.

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:29.138
But your efforts have earned you
the opportunity

01:28:29.222 --> 01:28:31.224
to negotiate for the lives of your family.

01:28:32.266 --> 01:28:35.645
Tell me where the rock is
or your little brother goes flying.

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:38.731
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid? I'll let him go.

01:28:38.815 --> 01:28:40.650
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?

01:28:43.903 --> 01:28:45.571
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:51.744
What are you doing?

01:28:54.622 --> 01:28:56.165
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!

01:28:56.249 --> 01:28:58.167
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!

01:29:06.634 --> 01:29:07.927
Impressive.

01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:11.973
There's two kinds of people in this world.

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:14.058
People who will do anything
to get what they want,

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:17.436
and everybody else.

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:20.273
You lose, Nick.

01:29:20.648 --> 01:29:21.816
Again.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:24.110
Clean this mess up.

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:27.154
You got 10 seconds, Nick.

01:29:29.949 --> 01:29:33.452
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother
right off the roof.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:42.420
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.

01:29:45.882 --> 01:29:47.300
Cops have keys, you douche.

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:49.385
I don't know that this
is such a great idea.

01:29:49.468 --> 01:29:52.471
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.

01:29:52.555 --> 01:29:54.724
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.

01:29:54.807 --> 01:29:56.934
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.

01:29:57.018 --> 01:29:58.060
Now it's five!

01:29:58.144 --> 01:29:59.228
It's between us, you piece of shit!

01:29:59.312 --> 01:30:00.396
- Four!
- Let him go!

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:01.647
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:09.155
Mike! Are you okay?

01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:20.499
Go on.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.543
Take it easy.

01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:28.132
Look. I'm sorry, Nick.

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.344
I didn't know they were
going to set you up.

01:30:33.387 --> 01:30:37.433
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?

01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:44.440
Officer down! Officer down!

01:30:44.523 --> 01:30:46.943
Request immediate assistance on the roof.

01:30:47.026 --> 01:30:48.110
Nick, he's getting away!

01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:50.029
Repeat! Officer down! Officer down!

01:30:50.571 --> 01:30:51.739
Nick!

01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:09.006
I'm sorry, Nick.

01:31:18.724 --> 01:31:20.935
Hey, one way or another...

01:31:23.062 --> 01:31:25.356
- Nick!
- No!

01:31:44.917 --> 01:31:46.919
Come on, folks! Stay back!

01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:50.297
- David!
- There he is!

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:52.800
Let's go!

01:31:54.218 --> 01:31:55.594
All right, freeze! Freeze!

01:31:58.139 --> 01:32:00.016
So what's it gonna be? Hmm?

01:32:01.017 --> 01:32:03.769
A shot in the head? Or back to prison?

01:32:11.027 --> 01:32:12.319
Are you getting that?

01:32:12.403 --> 01:32:14.989
You thought you'd get away with this?

01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:17.867
See? I'm an innocent man!

01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:20.202
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!

01:32:21.412 --> 01:32:22.788
I'm innocent!

01:32:24.707 --> 01:32:27.084
I love you, man! I love you!

01:32:28.377 --> 01:32:29.837
You got eyes in the back of your head?

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:32.548
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:34.008
Yeah, they're gonna
love you in prison.

01:32:35.593 --> 01:32:39.930
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that
you're innocent. How do you feel today?

01:32:43.559 --> 01:32:44.894
Crazy day, huh?

01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:50.900
But I would be proud to
work with you again.

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.985
You did good out there.

01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:54.111
Thanks, Dougherty.

01:32:58.324 --> 01:33:00.659
Looks like the Governor came through.

01:33:01.202 --> 01:33:03.996
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.

01:33:05.873 --> 01:33:08.000
See you around, Dougherty.

01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:10.377
One coming out.

01:33:10.878 --> 01:33:12.880
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:15.925 --> 01:33:18.010
Let's get you out of here.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:26.310
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.

01:33:28.104 --> 01:33:31.190
Now that you're off the ledge,
you got nothing to say to me?

01:33:35.778 --> 01:33:38.197
- Spill it.
- What?

01:33:39.073 --> 01:33:41.784
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?

01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:45.579
Let's go someplace quiet.

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:49.625
<i>That's right, Dan. It has been confirmed
that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy,</i>

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:51.585
<i>has been released from custody.</i>

01:33:58.968 --> 01:34:00.678
It's Cassidy!

01:34:03.097 --> 01:34:04.640
Two years in.

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:05.891
Don't I know it.

01:34:07.184 --> 01:34:09.854
Bartender! Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.

01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:13.524
Afraid not. That's my favorite channel.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.117
Lydia,

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:25.828
meet my dad.

01:34:26.245 --> 01:34:27.580
Your dad?

01:34:28.956 --> 01:34:30.040
Frank Cassidy.

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:32.376
Alive and well.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:34.420
Pleasure to meet you. Again.

01:34:34.837 --> 01:34:36.714
You gotta be shitting me.

01:34:39.592 --> 01:34:41.218
You're his father.

01:34:41.969 --> 01:34:43.637
Get off now.

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:46.640
I'm so proud of you.

01:34:46.724 --> 01:34:47.808
Get your hands off my wife.

01:34:47.892 --> 01:34:50.019
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.

01:34:50.436 --> 01:34:51.520
Hold on a second.

01:34:53.647 --> 01:34:55.524
Everyone, quiet down. Just quiet down.

01:34:57.568 --> 01:34:58.903
Quiet!

01:35:02.406 --> 01:35:04.074
Angela Maria Lopez.

01:35:16.045 --> 01:35:17.755
Will you marry me?

01:35:21.133 --> 01:35:23.052
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?

01:35:29.141 --> 01:35:31.268
Let me see it. Let me see it.

01:35:31.352 --> 01:35:32.478
Try it on. Try it on.

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:35.648
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.

01:35:36.774 --> 01:35:38.108
It is now.

01:35:39.944 --> 01:35:41.695
Drinks all around!

01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:46.408
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!

01:35:57.544 --> 01:35:59.296
<i>Well, I'm running

<i>What have I done?</i>

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:29.118
<i>What have I done?</i>

01:36:32.204 --> 01:36:35.416
<i>Yes, I'm running down the railway track</i>

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:38.669
<i>Could you help me?
Police on my back</i>

01:36:38.752 --> 01:36:41.839
<i>They will catch me if I dare drop back</i>

01:36:41.922 --> 01:36:45.092
