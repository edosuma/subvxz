WEBVTT

00:01.514 --> 00:03.450
FRAN: What exactly
did you see out there?

00:03.518 --> 00:05.688
I told you, he was huge and
wearing black leather and...

00:05.755 --> 00:07.626
had some kind of weapon.

00:07.692 --> 00:09.596
-I think he wanted to hurt me.
-(scoffs)

00:09.663 --> 00:11.065
This time of night
in Central Park,

00:11.132 --> 00:12.702
almost everyone
wants to hurt you.

00:12.769 --> 00:14.338
You said there's a group
of people in this city

00:14.405 --> 00:16.109
under attack by the government.
Start there.

00:16.175 --> 00:18.179
I worked at a lab assistant.

00:18.246 --> 00:19.850
I'd sanitize equipment.

00:19.917 --> 00:21.520
Prep samples.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.656
I'd write reports.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.526
That's how I got access
to the files.

00:25.662 --> 00:27.298
You ever heard of
Operation Paperclip?

00:27.364 --> 00:30.304
-No.
-It was a postwar program

00:30.370 --> 00:32.676
where the U. S. used
Nazi scientist

00:32.742 --> 00:35.648
against the Russians
during the Red Scare.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.155
-(echoing coughs)
-They'd crossbreed contagions,

00:39.222 --> 00:40.925
test them on patients.

00:40.992 --> 00:43.497
Mix animal diseases
with human ones.

00:43.564 --> 00:46.236
They were looking for something
that could be used as a weapon.

00:46.302 --> 00:48.340
They hit on something good,

00:48.406 --> 00:50.377
but it was too big
to be airborne,

00:50.444 --> 00:53.450
so they engineered it
to thrive in mucous membranes.

00:53.517 --> 00:55.387
-(heavy breathing)
-(distant coughing)

00:55.454 --> 00:57.659
And all of this happened
on U. S. soil?

00:57.726 --> 00:59.863
Nearby soil. Plum Island.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.199
Even if that's true,

01:01.266 --> 01:03.203
it was in the '50s
right after the war.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.740
What does it have to do
with now?

01:04.806 --> 01:06.376
The Cold War is heating up.

01:06.442 --> 01:07.846
A year ago,
they started bringing out

01:07.913 --> 01:10.718
some of the golden oldies
and testing them again.

01:10.785 --> 01:12.488
Testing? You mean on humans?

01:12.555 --> 01:15.260
-(coughing)
-FRAN: Drug addicts, prisoners,
homeless people.

01:15.327 --> 01:17.131
They get them to volunteer
for money.

01:17.197 --> 01:19.670
They were experimenting
with ticks

01:19.736 --> 01:20.738
as a delivery mechanism

01:20.805 --> 01:22.441
to spread the diseases.

01:23.276 --> 01:24.746
They think
some of the ticks got loose

01:24.813 --> 01:27.318
and spread the disease
outside the island.

01:27.384 --> 01:29.488
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

01:29.556 --> 01:31.392
Patients have been showing up
with conditions

01:31.459 --> 01:33.531
that should be rare, but...

01:33.598 --> 01:35.200
now they're all over the place.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.904
Some of them have
weird skin rashes,

01:36.971 --> 01:39.643
diarrhea,
like from a parasite.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.549
-They created it, all of it.
-Honestly,

01:42.616 --> 01:44.686
conspiracy theories are
dangerous.

01:44.753 --> 01:47.291
They absolutely hurt
more than they help.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.828
Medical misinformation,
which doctors like me

01:48.894 --> 01:50.464
call the fear of science,

01:50.531 --> 01:53.738
actually causes more infections,
a higher ratio of disease...

01:53.804 --> 01:56.977
The people that created
this were evil.

01:57.044 --> 01:59.616
I think they made the disease
as painful as possible,

01:59.683 --> 02:02.756
and they specifically targeted
the people they detest.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.029
Why are you telling
all this to me?

02:06.095 --> 02:08.266
I read the article in The Native

02:08.333 --> 02:10.538
about the infected deer
on Fire Island

02:10.605 --> 02:12.041
and how they were slaughtered.

02:12.107 --> 02:13.878
And I suggest you look
more closely

02:13.944 --> 02:15.715
at some of the symptoms
your patients have

02:15.782 --> 02:17.619
and go to the press.

02:17.686 --> 02:19.088
With what?

02:19.155 --> 02:20.925
I don't have
any proof of anything,

02:20.992 --> 02:22.562
and proof is everything.

02:22.629 --> 02:24.098
And a study could take years.

02:24.165 --> 02:25.968
Figure it out, and fast.

02:26.035 --> 02:27.438
My life is on the line.

02:27.505 --> 02:30.143
