00:08.009 --> 00:09.802
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.885 --> 00:11.887
The machine that Dr Wilkes built
is working.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.264
<i>And we've located Dottie.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:15.474
Don't expect Peggy Carter
to come and rescue you.

00:16.892 --> 00:21.230
I need you to discredit
and subdue Agent Carter.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.898
Dig something up on her?

00:23.441 --> 00:24.942
Drop your weapons!

00:25.651 --> 00:28.571
Peggy. Is this supposed to be a rescue?

00:28.946 --> 00:29.989
What did you tell her?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.741
- You knew this was a trap.
- Of course.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.075
<i>But it wasn't set for you.</i>

00:33.159 --> 00:34.577
<i>Jason.</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:35.870
<i>Ana.</i>

00:35.953 --> 00:37.329
We can help each other control it.

00:37.413 --> 00:38.748
You can't control it.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.750
You get what you need,
sweetheart?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.626
Not everything.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.211
You won't get away with this.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.088
She won't stop coming for you.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.591
Ana!

01:05.316 --> 01:06.525
<i>"An orange glow would
indicate</i>

01:06.609 --> 01:08.027
<i>"the Nitramene has reached
peak volatility</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:10.362
<i>"and should be handled with caution.</i>

01:10.446 --> 01:12.198
"Cracking its shell
would result in an implosion

01:12.281 --> 01:15.576
"with a blast radius of... Oh, 500 yards."

01:15.659 --> 01:16.702
Delightful.

01:16.786 --> 01:18.287
There's one last note here.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.373
"Avoid touching the core
to the containment ring.

01:21.457 --> 01:24.293
<i>- "Touching the core will result in..."</i>
- Death?

01:24.376 --> 01:29.090
I was going to say "core overload,"
but yes.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.382
Edwin, I'm home!

01:30.466 --> 01:32.301
Uh, I won't be a moment, Ana!

01:38.641 --> 01:39.975
Hello, darling.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.894
How was your life-drawing class?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.229
Excellent.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.147
Next week, we begin nudes.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.066
- How very progressive.
- Mmm.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.403
Who was that on the telephone?

01:52.404 --> 01:54.365
That was Mr Stark's newest associate.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.951
Is he going to help exonerate Mr Stark?

01:57.034 --> 01:58.994
- Who?
- The man on the phone.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.247
Woman, actually.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.041
- Ms Peggy Carter.
- Oh.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.002
I don't think she's like the others.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.588
I think he respects her.

02:09.672 --> 02:10.798
Hmm.

02:11.257 --> 02:14.510
Oh, where's my head?
Benny Goodman is starting.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.554
You are trying to distract me.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.222
Nonsense.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.186
- From what?
- Worry.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.564
There's nothing to be worried about.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.149
I promise you.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.651
Ms Carter won't interfere
with our lives in the least.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.282
Don't make promises you can't keep.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.836
Wasn't sure how much cream...

02:48.919 --> 02:51.172
The only thing I can get this
ridiculous machine to tune into

02:51.255 --> 02:53.799
- is Groucho Marx.
- I'll try.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.801
We have a very
precise schedule.

02:55.885 --> 02:58.429
And if I can just get Benny Goodman,
then maybe she'll...

03:01.223 --> 03:02.600
Oh!

03:07.396 --> 03:08.480
Sit.

03:16.405 --> 03:22.077
Look. She's out of surgery.
She has colour in her cheeks.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.289
Ms Carter, they can't even say
if she'll wake up.

03:26.790 --> 03:31.003
What Ana needs right now
is for you to be beside her,

03:31.086 --> 03:34.215
listening to your voice, no one else's.

03:37.343 --> 03:41.096
I'm going to go home,
pick up one of Howard's radios,

03:42.348 --> 03:45.643
bring you a change of clothes,
toothbrush, razor,

03:45.726 --> 03:50.898
so that when she does wake up,
you will look like you.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.610
All right?

03:58.197 --> 03:59.490
Good.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.891
You're awake.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.561
By my timing, you'll begin to lose mass
in two minutes.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.231
- You're studying me?
- I'm studying us.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.110
Now tell me.
What happens when you vanish?

04:36.193 --> 04:39.321
Do you travel to someplace else, or...
Tell me what you've learned.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.907
You have me handcuffed, and you
actually expect to compare notes?

04:41.991 --> 04:44.660
Yes. Physicist to physicist.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.622
And then you'll let me go?

04:58.424 --> 05:01.302
Hand me some paper and a pen,
and I'll write down the formulas

05:01.385 --> 05:03.595
- I used to create my containment unit.
- No, you're killing time.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.264
Excuse me?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.308
You think if you wait one minute,

05:07.391 --> 05:10.311
you'll just fade through those handcuffs
and escape, don't you?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.272
Or maybe you're waiting for
Peggy Carter to come and rescue you.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.940
- You want the truth?
- Yes.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.235
I'm hoping I disappear
and don't come back.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.695
Oh, I don't believe that.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.739
I don't believe that for a moment,

05:21.822 --> 05:24.241
not after you've worked so hard
to stay in the realm of existence.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.579
And there is another option
for you to consider,

05:28.662 --> 05:30.039
aside from your demise.

05:31.248 --> 05:36.003
We work together. Yes.
Examining each other.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.006
We already know
that if I get close to you,

05:39.131 --> 05:41.342
you draw Zero Matter from me
and become solid,

05:41.425 --> 05:43.052
which you can't control.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.804
I discovered that
while you were unconscious.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.306
Don't touch me!

05:54.646 --> 05:58.192
Just answer me this one question.
Do you hear it?

06:00.736 --> 06:02.363
- Hear what?
- The voice.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.407
As if it's coming from
your own thoughts,

06:05.491 --> 06:07.368
but it's coming from
someplace else.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.036
Do you hear it?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.790
Or am I truly going crazy?

06:19.421 --> 06:20.756
Ten seconds.

06:22.299 --> 06:26.970
Don't worry.
I promise you, this won't hurt a bit.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.910
Thank God you're all right.
What happened?

06:49.993 --> 06:51.537
Whitney Frost. She has Jason.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.122
Is he hurt?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.916
Ana Jarvis.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.629
Oh, no. She...

07:00.712 --> 07:04.049
She's in hospital. I...
I don't know.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.265
- What did you get into?
- Uh...

07:11.598 --> 07:14.768
Vernon Masters isn't above
ordering an old-fashioned beat down.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.688
He's looking for the uranium rods
for Whitney Frost.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.570
If she wants them so badly,
let's get them to her.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.701
You're willing to give up
the uranium rods for Jason?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.912
I need Whitney to think I am.
Question is, how do I reach her?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.207
Maybe Joseph Manfredi.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.543
His soldiers were helping out
at the Roxxon factory.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.752
But aren't they just men for hire?

07:40.836 --> 07:42.171
No, they're more than that.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.965
Wait. Where are you going?

07:45.757 --> 07:48.260
I need to change.
Oh, really, I need a hot bath, but...

07:48.552 --> 07:50.762
Oh, yeah, um...

07:51.889 --> 07:54.141
You were saying?
Joseph Manfredi, Whitney Frost?

07:55.058 --> 07:57.811
Uh... Yeah. They were an item.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.897
Movie star Whitney Frost
and a mobster?

08:00.022 --> 08:01.273
Remember the
Figueroa street slaughter?

08:01.940 --> 08:04.401
Six criminals gunned down
during a card game.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.903
Tabloids say
that happened the same day

08:05.986 --> 08:07.571
Whitney dumped Manfredi
for Calvin Chadwick.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.364
Oh, so he's a maniac.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.576
He's a man in love.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.413
Looks like we got company.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.126
We're looking for some spaghetti.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.171
- We only serve steak.
- I have a message for your chef.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.133
Sorry. We're closed.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.012
Oh, <i>nonna,</i> you're gonna love my gravy.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.847
I put a couple of cloves in there
at the end,

08:33.972 --> 08:35.766
- spice it up real nice.
- No, no, no, no.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.268
No, I'm not!

08:38.352 --> 08:40.687
No, I'm just trying something different!

08:43.524 --> 08:44.608
Oh, okay. What would you like?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.026
You want me to throw it in the trash?

08:46.109 --> 08:47.861
Is that what you want me to do?
Will that make you happy?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.029
Of course not!

08:49.112 --> 08:51.782
Of course not,
'cause nothing makes you happy, right?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.534
You can't be happy!

08:59.873 --> 09:01.583
Looks like we got two more for lunch.

09:03.544 --> 09:08.173
<i>Speed it onward
Loud her praises tell</i>

09:08.257 --> 09:13.679
<i>Hail to thee, our alma mater</i>

09:13.762 --> 09:18.684
<i>Hail, all hail, Cornell</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:21.728
Get out the road, you drunks!

09:24.731 --> 09:26.942
Why won't you tell me
how you broke your hand?

09:28.527 --> 09:34.157
Mmm, maybe 'cause I did it taking down
a high-level Russian operative.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.910
Yeah, all right, mate.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.747
Yo, would I lie to you?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.416
Oh, please!

09:42.749 --> 09:46.628
You did it in a bar fight,
just like every year in uni.

09:47.129 --> 09:51.717
Freshman year, broken nose, bar fight.
Sophomore year, broken jaw, bar fight.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.177
- Junior year, you broke...
- Uh, yeah, yeah! Mmm.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.888
Talk too much. Now I'm empty.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.726
Well, we're at the right place, then.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.022
Hey, yeah...

10:05.105 --> 10:09.693
Before I black out,
all right, did your MI4... 5?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.945
Your MI-whatever,
did they find that thing?

10:13.530 --> 10:17.868
I've never had to break
so many security protocols

10:18.201 --> 10:22.414
only to find a fully redacted file
at the end of the rainbow.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.958
Oh! What you gonna do?

10:25.626 --> 10:31.256
Jack, let's not pretend.
I know why you're really here.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.966
Oh, yeah?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.095
You want another shot
at taking down my record

10:37.179 --> 10:39.222
of Piccadilly Commandos
in an evening.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.726
Am I that see-through?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.520
You don't hurry.
I'm gonna get a head start.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.441
<i>Lift the chorus
Speed it onward</i>

10:49.524 --> 10:52.402
<i>Loud her praises tell</i>

11:30.399 --> 11:34.111
Whitney Frost was employing your
muscle at a Roxxon facility we raided.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.363
Look, I wish I could help you,

11:36.446 --> 11:39.241
but how am I to know
who my associates associate with?

11:42.077 --> 11:44.121
Look at that. She likes you.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.625
She thinks you're the devil.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.627
<i>Malocchio</i>.

11:52.421 --> 11:56.091
Mr Manfredi, we know you have
a relationship with Whitney Frost.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.968
Yeah, everybody in town knows that.

12:01.388 --> 12:05.100
Everybody also knows that
she dumped me for a crooked politician.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.060
All we need you to do
is get a message to her.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.150
All right, look what you're doing.
Okay, that's it. Stop.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.526
Stop eating. You two have to go.

12:14.735 --> 12:17.154
- She's got a weak heart.
- She seems rather robust to me.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.866
You know Little Tommy Fontana's
getting out next week?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.784
Oh, yeah, sure, I know.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.078
I'm in charge of
baking him a welcome-home cake.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.664
Be a shame if Tommy found out

12:27.748 --> 12:29.624
you were the one who turned
state's evidence against him.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.669
That's a lie.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.005
Tommy don't know that.

12:38.258 --> 12:42.053
No! No! <i>Nonna, nonna,</i> no.
<i>Basta, basta.</i>

12:42.137 --> 12:43.180
<i>Nonna.</i>

12:44.598 --> 12:45.849
Let go.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.685
Give us a moment, please.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.326
What message would you like me
to deliver to Ms Frost?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.624
What do you think of my research?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.085
I think you're a mass murderer of rats.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.088
My experiments,
Dr Wilkes, though rudimentary,

13:17.172 --> 13:18.757
they have produced results.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.802
I know how to control this,
and I think you can, too.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.805
I don't want to control this.
I want it gone.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.139
See, that's where your problem lies.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.392
You see this as a curse.
I see it as a gift.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.019
- You think this is a gift?
- Yes!

13:31.102 --> 13:33.313
To be at the whim of a force
that's trying to destroy me?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.398
Only because you resist it.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.485
If you accept it, then you control it.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.953
Do you hear that?
You hear that, don't you?

13:49.412 --> 13:52.082
It's there. Right now.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.087
And if you listen, it will guide you.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.428
Hello, gorgeous,
I got something urgent.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.847
Wait.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.769
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, Dr Wilkes.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.481
Shut out everything else
and just embrace what you hear.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.197
What? What is it?

14:24.739 --> 14:26.116
First things first.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.833
Peggy Carter paid me a visit today.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.293
And what did you say?

14:36.376 --> 14:41.047
Ah, she did most of the talking.
She wants her scientist back bad.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.299
I'm not surprised.

14:42.591 --> 14:48.305
She's willing to give you the uranium
rods in exchange for him, unharmed.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.561
Tell Ms Carter she has a deal.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.609
I promise to wear
the periwinkle tie you knitted for me.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.199
I promise to cook apple torte
at least once a week.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.792
I promise not to bite the fork loudly
when I eat.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.635
I promise we can get
a Bernese mountain dog.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.768
I promise to like your brown cardigan.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.943
I promise to believe
in the daily horoscope.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.244
I promise I will protect you

15:53.328 --> 15:55.664
to my dying day,

16:01.962 --> 16:06.967
if you'll please, please, wake up.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.475
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.896
You're awake.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.023
My darling, you're awake.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.776
I woke up at the Bernese mountain dog.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.240
But I wanted to see
what else I could get.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.285
Hmm.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.123
I'm going to get you the physician.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.335
Oh...

16:43.753 --> 16:45.046
First...

16:50.176 --> 16:51.594
Now doctor.

16:53.263 --> 16:57.475
Yes, she is awake and talking
and beautiful and everything.

16:58.601 --> 17:03.523
Yes, yes, I will keep you updated.
And, Ms Carter...

17:06.151 --> 17:07.402
Thank you.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.871
Doctor, I want to thank you
and your staff

17:17.954 --> 17:19.706
for everything
that you've done for us.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.459
When do you think
we might be able to go home?

17:23.835 --> 17:25.295
As you know,
the surgery was very difficult.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.048
There was a great deal
of internal damage.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.799
We almost lost her several times.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.343
Yes, but you said
that the surgery was successful.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.221
And on the whole, it was.
We saved her life.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.727
But there were some complications,
some damage we couldn't fully repair.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.315
I don't know if you and your wife
had ever planned on having children,

17:47.192 --> 17:48.860
but that won't be possible now.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.743
Does she know?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.788
We have a nurse
who can sit down with your wife

17:59.871 --> 18:00.955
and explain everything to her.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.168
Thank you, no. I'll talk to her myself.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.147
What did he say?

18:35.198 --> 18:38.618
He gave me the laundry list
of prescriptions I need to get for you.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.330
We're going to need shopping bags.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.042
Anything else?

18:47.669 --> 18:48.753
No.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.589
No.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.883
You're perfect.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.390
Are these volatile?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.558
Nope.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.602
It certainly reads like uranium.
How did you do it?

19:04.686 --> 19:05.895
It's pretty simple.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.398
I just painted some U-238
with a radium mixture.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.401
- Good job, Aloysius. Really good work.
- Oh?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.486
See you learned my first name.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.364
- Yeah, I did.
- What's my middle name?

19:17.699 --> 19:19.993
Samberly, what is with you?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.579
We take you on missions,
we treat you with respect.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.873
Why are you always looking for things
to be offended by?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.000
- Who knows anybody's middle name?
- It's Herbert.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.003
Thanks.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.255
Dr Samberly, you'll be driving the truck.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.590
You will be providing cover.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.175
And you'll handle the transaction.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.677
We need to get
Dr Wilkes' containment unit to the truck.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.429
You can take it apart
and put it back together?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.097
I hate that you even asked me
that question.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.474
I will assume that's a yes.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.563
All right, let's get to it.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.106
To what?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.025
What are you doing here?
Where's Ana?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.528
She's still at the hospital
until she regains her strength.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.405
I came to get her cashmere throw.
What are you doing?

19:57.739 --> 19:59.699
We're going to get Wilkes,
then we're going to get Whitney.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.992
How?

20:02.076 --> 20:03.286
You don't have to worry about it.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.580
You can go back to your wife
knowing full well

20:05.663 --> 20:06.873
that I will make this right.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.958
How?

20:12.587 --> 20:15.006
Mr Jarvis,
I understand that you have a great deal

20:15.089 --> 20:16.466
invested into the outcome
of this mission.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.760
Indeed. Whitney Frost shot my wife.
I'm coming with you.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.178
No, you're going back to the hospital.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.804
I want her to pay for what she did to us.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.515
And she will.
Chief Sousa and I will make sure of it.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.017
And I will be there to see it.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.396
What's that noise?

20:31.064 --> 20:32.565
That's Mr Stark's telex.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.619
Do you recognise this code?

20:46.371 --> 20:51.042
That's not code.
These are design specifications.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.670
Howard Stark wants me to build
a machine.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.796
You? It says that?

20:55.088 --> 20:57.966
Well, no, but you see someone else here
who can?

20:58.049 --> 20:59.425
What does the machine do?

20:59.509 --> 21:01.552
I'm not sure.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.596
A cannon.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.432
Something to do with gamma radiation.

21:06.724 --> 21:11.437
I believe it fires a pulse
of high-energy photons.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.563
Which does what?

21:13.064 --> 21:15.066
It could eliminate Zero Matter.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.068
Perhaps it could cure Jason Wilkes.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.611
Or kill Whitney Frost.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.488
Look, you already
got me to admit I don't know.

21:20.571 --> 21:21.823
Do you think you can build it?

21:23.366 --> 21:26.244
Samberly, I swear to God,
you're on my last nerve right now.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.705
I can do it, but it's complicated.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.290
I don't know how long it'll take.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.749
We need it done as quickly as possible.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.584
Then I should start now.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.587
Handoff is happening
in less than an hour.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.968
It appears you need a new driver.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.931
Look at the three of you.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.101
Larry, Curly,
could you give me a moment?

21:50.184 --> 21:51.769
I need to have a word with Moe.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.026
Jack, I have neither the time
nor the patience right now.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.695
You will.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.947
What is this?

22:03.031 --> 22:06.951
You have something on me, right?
Now we're even.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.620
But I promise, I won't say a word.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.415
As long as you drop
whatever it is that you're doing

22:12.498 --> 22:15.168
and come with me back to New York
to play by the rules.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.836
What are you prattling on about?

22:17.754 --> 22:19.922
This covers your activities
in June, 1944.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.174
I was in the war, same as you.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.801
If you want to compare war crimes,
yours are a lot worse.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.348
Who put you up to this?
Was it Vernon Masters?

22:28.473 --> 22:30.350
All you need to worry about
is what's in that file.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.852
And you never thought
to question the convenience?

22:33.478 --> 22:38.191
Vernon asked you to discredit me,
and you locate the ideal report.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.485
Whatever this is, it's a forgery.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.820
I'm not falling for your slick talk.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.072
But you're falling for his.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.492
You're willing to believe any phlegm
Vernon coughs up onto the paper

22:47.575 --> 22:49.952
because you're worried
that I would betray your trust.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.080
I wouldn't.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.916
This is your choice, not mine.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.462
Chief Thompson, you don't need to
cut corners to get ahead.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.131
You're better than that.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.193
Hello, gorgeous.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.404
Don't call me that.

23:24.862 --> 23:25.947
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.241
I know what I look like.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.492
Yeah.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.370
You're more beautiful today
than the day I met you.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.289
Ah! You are a terrible liar, Joe.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.166
Hey! I'm not lying!

23:39.502 --> 23:43.214
That mark on your face
is nothing to be ashamed of.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.468
It's power.

23:49.387 --> 23:50.972
And that's what makes you so beautiful.

23:52.557 --> 23:57.395
And you should never have to hide it
from the rest of the world.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.486
There's my girl.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.121
Rain check. They're here.

24:15.746 --> 24:16.831
Bring him out!

24:18.875 --> 24:20.042
Move.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.557
Agent Carter.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.310
Jason, you're solid. How?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.770
- Peggy, don't do this, please.
- Mmm-mmm.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.107
You've seen your goods.
Now let me see mine.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.207
Such a pity,

24:59.290 --> 25:02.335
that two accomplished women should
be standing on opposite sides.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.921
Yes, you're such a staunch defender
of the sisterhood.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.590
I could tell by the way you shot
an unarmed, innocent woman.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.843
Well, occasionally,
sacrifices must be made.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.350
35,000 CPMs. They pass muster.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.608
Ah-ah! Hand over Dr Wilkes.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.157
Less than a minute to go

25:33.241 --> 25:35.660
before you have to crawl back
in your cage like an animal.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.245
Don't worry.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.215
They're fake.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.425
- Move! Move!
- Those are fake. Stop them!

25:51.509 --> 25:53.386
- Go! Move!
- Stop them!

25:54.845 --> 25:56.806
Stop them!

26:08.484 --> 26:09.777
They're following us.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.237
<i>I see them.</i>

26:15.825 --> 26:18.536
You're all right.
We'll lose them, and you'll be safe.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.329
She's never going to stop.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.623
Till she gets those rods,
she's gonna keep coming for us.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.166
- We'll beat her.
- How?

26:24.250 --> 26:26.002
Howard sent specifications
for a machine.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.297
- What kind of machine?
- A gamma cannon.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.716
Gamma rays? Uh...

26:32.174 --> 26:33.968
Do you have any idea
how dangerous those are?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.887
We have to destroy those rods now.

26:36.971 --> 26:38.598
The rods are safe. She won't find them.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.225
Are they gaining on us?

26:41.309 --> 26:43.269
<i>No, they're still
at quite a distance.</i>

26:46.856 --> 26:48.399
Why are they being so slow?

26:48.482 --> 26:50.901
They're in a big-block caddie.
They should've lapped us by now.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.239
- What are you doing?
- Jason, what's happening?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.533
Where are the rods?
Put it down, Wilkes.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.659
Jason, I don't understand it.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.161
You are outside of
your containment chamber.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.830
Ms Frost taught me a few things
about my condition.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.206
Turns out she's as brilliant
as we thought.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.792
This isn't you talking. You've been
affected by the Zero Matter.

27:06.876 --> 27:07.960
Where are the rods, Peggy?

27:08.044 --> 27:09.503
What, so you can give them to Frost?
Forget about it.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.005
I'm not going backwards. Where...

27:11.088 --> 27:13.299
Lower your gun,
and we will figure this out together.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.010
- No. Tell me where they...
- I won't.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.720
You'll have to kill me.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.017
- Okay, okay.
- Sousa, tell me.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.226
Jason, stop this.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.228
I know how you feel about her.
You want her to die for this?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.480
Daniel, don't listen to him.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.232
If I have to choose
between her life or mine,

27:30.316 --> 27:31.567
I know what I'm choosing.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.402
- Don't tell him, Daniel. Listen to me.
- Tell me

27:33.486 --> 27:35.529
or you will never see her breathe again!

27:36.656 --> 27:37.823
- The SSR.
- Daniel, stop!

27:37.907 --> 27:38.991
- Where?
- No!

27:39.075 --> 27:40.326
Wall safe at the SSR lab.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.912
I'm sorry.

27:47.625 --> 27:48.709
Stop the truck!

28:08.062 --> 28:10.564
Oh! Great work, Jack.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.193
Above and beyond.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.195
Thanks.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.615
Got to tell you,

28:20.700 --> 28:22.952
I'm starting to question
the validity of that file.

28:23.494 --> 28:26.163
I mean, it's just...
It's a little too good to be true.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.166
Jack,

28:29.250 --> 28:32.253
what's happened and what's true
are two different things.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.589
Now, this is an official document.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.801
That means it's true,
regardless of what happened.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.762
Do I really need to be telling you this?

28:42.972 --> 28:45.266
No. Sir, I understand that.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.351
Still...

28:48.477 --> 28:50.855
My gut is telling me that Peggy Carter...

28:52.148 --> 28:54.275
Sir, woman on line one said it's urgent.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.318
- Yeah, yeah.
- She knew your access code.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.284
Vernon Masters.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.246
Jack, could you give me a minute?

29:07.329 --> 29:09.582
And close the door on your way out.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.433
<i>Then I'll retrieve them
at once.</i>

29:27.516 --> 29:30.561
<i>Spoken like someone
pretending he had a choice.</i>

29:30.644 --> 29:33.063
<i>I'll need you to bring them
directly to me.</i>

29:44.033 --> 29:45.534
Vernon.

29:49.205 --> 29:50.372
Jack.

29:51.499 --> 29:55.085
Now's not a good time.
Wait for me in my office, will you?

29:55.544 --> 29:56.837
I won't let you do this.

30:03.469 --> 30:07.056
Jack, I owe you a sincere apology.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.266
I underestimated you.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.769
- You're right to call me on it.
- Can't let you take them, Vernon.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.479
Looks like you're gonna be
getting that promotion a...

30:13.562 --> 30:15.606
Stop! Right there.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.276
Oh...

30:20.986 --> 30:24.907
You have no idea
how sorry I am to hear that.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.628
Jack? What are you doing here?

30:40.297 --> 30:41.423
I don't know.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.177
- Why are you in the lab?
- Ah...

30:47.346 --> 30:51.183
I'm not sure.
I was in the bullpen. Now I'm here.

30:51.267 --> 30:52.852
Damn it.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.521
Look.

30:56.397 --> 30:59.942
Chief Thompson, someone used
this device to give you amnesia.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.402
Do you have any memory of who?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.237
Excuse me?

31:03.320 --> 31:04.363
The uranium is gone.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.615
Jack, this is of
the utmost importance.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.158
What is the last thing
that you remember?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.620
I was on the phone.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.426
Who were you talking to?

31:25.676 --> 31:29.680
I wasn't talking. I was listening.
To Vernon and a woman.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.307
Is this your handwriting?

31:33.058 --> 31:35.227
- Yeah.
- Those are coordinates.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.729
To Whitney Frost.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.027
Let's hurry up.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.030
Or do you need me
to load your weapons, too?

31:46.322 --> 31:48.866
Why don't you stay here in case
we're wrong and Vernon returns?

31:49.909 --> 31:52.536
Don't you trust me, Danny boy?
I'm hurt.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.538
You don't have the best track record.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.667
Your backup is a lab tech and a butler.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.378
If I were you,
I'd take all the help I could get.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.340
Two hours ago, you were using
a redacted file to frame me.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.467
And 20 minutes ago,
I was having my brain zapped.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.094
If I were helping them,
I'd be on my way there.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.804
But I'm here with you.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.643
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.395
- I think he's being honest.
- Agreed.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.731
In the name of honesty,

32:20.814 --> 32:23.859
I need to make sure we're squared away
about the mission here.

32:28.364 --> 32:31.241
Wilkes is no longer a hostage.
He's a hostile.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.827
He's infected with Zero Matter.
He's confused.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.704
No. He's desperate.

32:36.747 --> 32:37.998
You don't know him, Daniel.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.416
But I know desperation.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.877
You know what I'd give
to be able to walk again?

32:41.961 --> 32:43.170
A lot.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.714
We need to be dispassionate
about this.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.841
Meaning what?

32:48.968 --> 32:50.302
I know you and Wilkes are close.

32:51.595 --> 32:54.473
Are you suggesting
that my personal feelings

32:54.556 --> 32:55.683
might interfere with the mission?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.935
I'm just saying,

32:58.018 --> 32:59.770
we might have to
make some hard choices, okay?

32:59.853 --> 33:02.898
That's wonderful advice, Chief Sousa,
and I hope you yourself abide by it.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.610
- What does that mean?
- You are the reason why Whitney Frost

33:06.694 --> 33:08.445
is in possession of enough
uranium to destroy the city.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.197
Excuse... He was gonna shoot you.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.323
Yes, he was.

33:11.407 --> 33:12.574
And I was supposed to
just let it happen?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.284
"Dispassionate," Chief. Your word.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.495
So if the situation was reversed,
that's what you would've done?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.872
Let him shoot me?

33:22.960 --> 33:27.172
If it makes a difference,
I'd have let him blow you both away.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.259
Let's go!

33:30.801 --> 33:33.387
So, you think Howard Stark's
gamma cannon will work?

33:33.887 --> 33:36.515
Well, thanks to some fixes I made, yes.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.475
- It will work.
- Will it kill Whitney?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.896
Which answer would you find
more attractive?

33:43.397 --> 33:44.481
So you don't know.

33:44.565 --> 33:48.360
Look, just because I saved the day
by building this invention

33:48.444 --> 33:50.821
doesn't mean this mission
won't be dangerous.

33:50.904 --> 33:51.947
I might not return.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.575
You'll be fine.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.747
Might I have a word?

34:00.205 --> 34:01.457
Way to kill the moment.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.293
What do you want now?

34:04.668 --> 34:06.545
With her, actually.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.262
Mr Jarvis, I'm...
I heard about your wife. I'm so...

34:15.345 --> 34:18.015
Ms Roberts, I don't know how long
this foray will take.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.976
Would you look after Ana
while I'm gone?

34:22.603 --> 34:25.230
Yes. With pleasure.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.196
Just a few of her favourite recipes.

34:32.446 --> 34:33.822
Oh, okay.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.866
- Cashmere blanket for cold nights.
- Okay.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.994
Her favourite mug,
from our wedding anniversary.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.746
I'm sorry. I may have misunderstood.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.831
- How long do you think...
- And this.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.000
If necessary.

34:45.793 --> 34:46.877
Oh, my...

34:48.337 --> 34:49.588
Oh...

34:51.215 --> 34:52.591
I promise.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.177
I will keep her safe.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.179
Thank you.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.348
Let's move.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.577
Jack estimates
they have a 90 minute lead on us.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.621
Copy.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.290
Mr Jarvis, are you all right?

35:25.374 --> 35:26.708
I'm fine.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.473
Are we ready?

35:42.224 --> 35:43.350
Ready.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.980
I've always loved fireworks.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.233
Well, just fire, really.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.072
What if this doesn't work?

35:57.156 --> 35:58.949
The rift will open.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.494
Zero Matter will pour out,
and you and I will absorb it.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.246
But what if that's not what happens?

36:04.705 --> 36:06.832
I held a gun on a woman
who only wanted to help.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.293
If this doesn't work,
I've thrown everything away for nothing.

36:09.376 --> 36:10.752
Dr Wilkes, it will work.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.214
You know this will work
the same way that I do.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.759
Because the whisper in your head
says it will.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.596
Hit it!

36:40.699 --> 36:43.035
- Good Lord.
- We're too late.

37:03.347 --> 37:04.765
Oh, it's beautiful.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.767
You hear it, too.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.936
What do you hear?

37:09.019 --> 37:10.312
A voice.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.568
No. No, I don't hear anything.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.870
Jason. No. Jason, what are you doing?

37:28.497 --> 37:29.706
What are you...

37:30.040 --> 37:32.042
No! What about me?

37:33.627 --> 37:36.129
Take me! No!

37:36.338 --> 37:37.923
It's supposed to be me!

37:38.882 --> 37:42.636
No! What about me? Take me!

37:47.182 --> 37:50.269
Do you think that gamma pulse
can reach that far?

37:52.646 --> 37:53.855
I suppose.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.065
"Suppose" or "yes"?

37:55.148 --> 37:56.942
Yes. Maybe.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.736
- Who is this guy?
- And if it hits the rift?

37:59.820 --> 38:00.988
Great.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.406
Will it close the rift?

38:02.489 --> 38:05.909
Yes. Maybe. I don't know.

38:06.535 --> 38:09.037
- Did you hire him?
- Unfortunately.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.290
You're asking me to judge
what will happen

38:11.373 --> 38:14.334
when something I've never fired
miraculously manages to hit something

38:14.418 --> 38:15.711
I never knew existed?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.462
I guess this is where we find out.

38:17.546 --> 38:18.588
What about Miss Frost?

38:18.672 --> 38:20.299
She'll have to wait. We will get her.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.302
But first, we need to close the rift
before any Zero Matter gets out.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.929
He doesn't even know
if Mr Stark's gamma cannon will work.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.557
It's my cannon.
You should know you only get one shot.

38:29.433 --> 38:30.809
- At what?
- At all.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.895
I had just enough time to manufacture
one battery charge.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.397
Whitney Frost will get away.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.775
We need to close the rift.
Mr Jarvis, stop!

38:38.859 --> 38:41.236
Would you just shoot the thing,
for God's sake?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.739
And I'll try and prevent him
from killing himself.

38:51.621 --> 38:52.706
Chief.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.084
Chief, what do we do?

38:56.710 --> 38:58.503
- Do as Peggy says!
- Do as Peggy says!

38:59.421 --> 39:01.381
Edwin Jarvis, stop what you're doing!

39:03.175 --> 39:04.384
<i>Mr Jarvis!</i>

39:05.552 --> 39:06.970
Jarvis!

39:07.679 --> 39:09.765
<i>Mr Jarvis, pick up the radio this...</i>

39:12.351 --> 39:13.727
- One degree up.
- Are you accounting

39:13.810 --> 39:14.895
for the easterly breeze?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.229
Three degrees right.

39:16.313 --> 39:17.606
You can't just fire it straight.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.775
The pulse tends to travel
on a parabolic arc.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.943
Okay, I got it, Samberly, thank you.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.987
I didn't know your unit was in artillery.

39:24.821 --> 39:25.947
It wasn't.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.407
Another degree up.

39:29.785 --> 39:31.119
Set. Load it.

39:33.747 --> 39:35.791
Safety first, boys!

39:39.878 --> 39:41.505
Drive her home, Chief.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.675
Can't make any promises.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.154
Dr Wilkes?

40:08.865 --> 40:13.412
Dr Wilkes. Dr Wilkes.
Dr Wilkes, can you hear me?

40:14.162 --> 40:15.539
Jason?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.378
Edwin?

40:24.798 --> 40:25.882
Hi.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.304
Apple torte?
I hear it's your favourite.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.806
Where's Mr Jarvis?

40:34.558 --> 40:36.017
Who are you?

40:36.143 --> 40:41.773
I'm Rose. I work with Peg.
Mr Jarvis said he'll be back shortly

40:41.857 --> 40:44.860
and that I should keep you
company until he gets back.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.114
I understand
that you like to play hangman.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.367
You guess first.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.581
Five letters.

40:58.874 --> 40:59.916
E.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.835
E's a good choice.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.755
P.
- Nope.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.674
S.

41:09.259 --> 41:10.469
Mmm...

41:10.802 --> 41:11.845
M?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.312
Jason!

41:20.395 --> 41:21.521
Whitney Frost!

41:22.105 --> 41:24.357
Something happened to him.
He went inside...

41:25.192 --> 41:27.360
No! What did you do?

41:27.694 --> 41:28.862
I stopped her.

41:32.365 --> 41:33.617
He's breathing.

41:36.036 --> 41:39.039
A problem. So is she.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.086
Run. Now.

41:48.381 --> 41:49.716
You're gonna pay for that.

41:52.552 --> 41:53.970
- Plug them!
- Wait!

41:55.305 --> 41:58.266
Wait. Wait.

42:00.435 --> 42:01.561
He has what I want.

42:02.729 --> 42:06.691
And the key to controlling him
is to control those that he loves.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.110
Keep them alive.
