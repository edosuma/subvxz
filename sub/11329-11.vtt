WEBVTT

00:03.016 --> 00:06.118
So, everyone's going to the park to
celebrate the last day of school!

00:06.119 --> 00:08.823
I don't feel like celebrating.
I still haven't heard from Amy.

00:08.824 --> 00:12.328
I think I maybe wanna stay a day or
two extra at the end of the program.

00:12.329 --> 00:15.365
Maybe you could think about me flying
to New York at the end of the program

00:15.366 --> 00:16.967
just like all
the other dads are doing.

00:16.968 --> 00:19.504
Amy, is that really you?
I'm just calling to let you know

00:19.505 --> 00:21.507
that I will talk to you at some
point but not over the phone.

00:21.508 --> 00:24.143
I don't know if I can not
call you for two more weeks.

00:24.144 --> 00:26.846
I wanna do something with you
that you haven't done with her.

00:26.847 --> 00:29.116
Something else like what?
Spend the night at Grace's guest house.

00:29.117 --> 00:31.118
I wanna be a doctor.
I wanna be a doctor.

00:31.119 --> 00:32.186
No way.

00:32.186 --> 00:34.122
The only girl
I'm interested in is Amy.

00:34.123 --> 00:35.490
Well, I've got news for you.

00:35.491 --> 00:37.525
Ricky's flying to New York
to see Amy this weekend.

00:37.526 --> 00:38.626
What?

00:38.627 --> 00:40.863
It's really good
to see you, Amy.

00:40.864 --> 00:42.800
Good morning, Doctor.

00:44.136 --> 00:46.203
This is my baby.

00:46.204 --> 00:49.506
And I'm just going to accept
that this is my fate,

00:49.507 --> 00:51.509
and I'm gonna marry Adrian
and learn to love her.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.810
Could we ever have sex again?

00:52.811 --> 00:54.412
Could you ever not sleep
with every girl

00:54.413 --> 00:56.381
you got the chance to sleep with?
I'm working on that.

00:56.382 --> 00:58.149
Ricky, it's one thing
to say that.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.951
It's another thing
to actually not do it.

01:04.357 --> 01:07.026
I just thought I'd call.

01:07.027 --> 01:09.029
Oh, for no apparent reason?

01:09.030 --> 01:13.202
No. Just wanted to say hi,
see how you are.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.872
Thanks, Adrian.
I've been wondering how you are, too.

01:15.873 --> 01:19.877
Really? I would've thought Ricky
would've told you this weekend how I am.

01:19.878 --> 01:22.347
Oh, no. We really didn't have
a lot of time to talk about you.

01:22.348 --> 01:24.349
Oh? Why is that?

01:24.350 --> 01:27.753
He was only here for a short time,
and we had a lot to discuss.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.355
Like?

01:29.356 --> 01:32.091
Like stuff about John. So how are you?
How are you feeling?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.460
Just like I told Ricky last week
when he came over

01:34.461 --> 01:36.330
and stayed
half the night talking to me,

01:36.331 --> 01:38.733
I'm feeling good, really good.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.001
So no more morning sickness?

01:40.002 --> 01:42.236
No. You know,

01:42.237 --> 01:44.839
Ben was really upset
that Ricky just took off

01:44.840 --> 01:46.840
and flew to New York
without telling him.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.109
He still loves you. Ben.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.911
He's a nice guy... Ben.

01:50.912 --> 01:52.445
I'm sure he'll be
a responsible dad.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.380
I'm sure.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.149
You know, my dad
really wants us to get married.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.151
I mean, how crazy is that...

01:59.152 --> 02:00.819
Ben and me married?

02:00.820 --> 02:03.456
I mean, everyone knows
that he's in love with you.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.458
He's always been in love
with you,

02:05.459 --> 02:08.262
just like Ricky's always kind of
been in love with me, you know?

02:08.263 --> 02:12.332
Yeah. Well, babies have a way
of making relationships change

02:12.333 --> 02:14.200
whether you want the
relationship to change or not.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.401
What do you mean by that?

02:15.402 --> 02:17.402
I mean, relationships change.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.805
Things happen, babies are born.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.441
Then the babies grow up.
Sometimes so do the parents.

02:22.442 --> 02:25.310
Are you telling me I need to grow up?
Is that what you're saying?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.745
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying at all.

02:27.746 --> 02:31.283
I'm sorry you took it that way.
Please don't take it that way, Adrian.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.586
I really want us to be friends.
And I think we have a good shot at being friends.

02:34.587 --> 02:38.991
I do, because it's a very difficult
experience having a baby in high school,

02:38.992 --> 02:42.227
and, you know, girls tend to relate to
each other based on common experiences.

02:42.228 --> 02:46.097
Well, we also have the common
experiences of Ben and Ricky.

02:46.098 --> 02:48.233
Actually, I've never had sex
with Ben, remember?

02:48.234 --> 02:50.768
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

02:50.769 --> 02:54.238
Well, he surprised me.

02:54.239 --> 02:56.173
It was a lot of fun.

02:56.174 --> 02:59.677
It was the only time I've ever seen
him let loose and enjoy himself.

02:59.678 --> 03:02.446
I don't think we should be talking
about what the two of you did.

03:02.447 --> 03:04.748
It's all very personal
and private and all that.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.150
I'm just saying

03:07.151 --> 03:09.218
maybe you should
sleep with him.

03:09.219 --> 03:12.555
Adrian, I don't think I'm gonna have sex
again with anyone I'm not marrying.

03:12.556 --> 03:16.258
You and Ricky... you're not thinking
of getting married, are you?

03:16.259 --> 03:18.260
You didn't get married
this past weekend, did you?

03:18.261 --> 03:22.062
Adrian, Ricky and I decided to keep what
happened this weekend between the two of us.

03:22.063 --> 03:24.097
But then you'll tell
Lauren and Madison,

03:24.098 --> 03:26.199
and Madison will tell Jack,
and Jack will tell Grace,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.234
and she'll tell Ben, so you
might as well just tell me.

03:28.235 --> 03:30.603
Can't. Sorry.
Why don't we talk about something else?

03:30.604 --> 03:32.938
Because I wanna know what's
going on between you and Ricky,

03:32.939 --> 03:35.441
and I would think you would wanna know
what's going on between me and Ricky.

03:35.442 --> 03:37.576
No. No, that's between
Ricky and you.

03:37.577 --> 03:38.843
Just tell me!

03:45.750 --> 03:47.083
Closing time.

03:47.084 --> 03:49.919
Good night, and good luck,
and may the best man win,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.621
and may that be before
you two come back tomorrow.

03:52.622 --> 03:54.623
What's that supposed to mean...
"May the best man win"?

03:54.624 --> 03:56.724
Trying to make light
of a dark situation.

03:56.725 --> 03:58.760
It's not funny.
He saw Amy.

03:58.761 --> 04:01.897
He went to New York this weekend and
didn't even tell me that he was going.

04:01.898 --> 04:04.733
It wasn't any of your business. And you know what?
It's still not any of your business.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.134
Or any of mine.

04:06.135 --> 04:08.102
The only thing that's my
business is this butcher shop.

04:08.103 --> 04:10.271
And if the two of you
wanna keep your jobs,

04:10.272 --> 04:12.506
I suggest you get together
and talk it out

04:12.507 --> 04:14.875
and come back tomorrow
with a new attitude

04:14.876 --> 04:16.610
before I give you
your walking papers.

04:16.611 --> 04:18.278
How are we supposed
to talk about anything

04:18.279 --> 04:19.911
when everything
is none of my business?

04:19.913 --> 04:21.814
It's between Amy and me, okay?

04:21.815 --> 04:24.182
Fine. Amy will tell Madison
and Lauren what happened,

04:24.183 --> 04:26.918
Madison will tell Jack, Jack will
tell Grace, and Grace will tell me.

04:26.919 --> 04:28.353
But I'm not gonna tell you.

04:28.354 --> 04:31.355
I'm gonna tell you both
one more time.

04:31.356 --> 04:34.024
Talk it out outside of the shop

04:34.025 --> 04:36.526
and come back tomorrow
with a new attitude.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.335
Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me!

04:47.971 --> 04:50.005
You're fired.

04:50.006 --> 04:51.006
Both of us?

04:53.000 --> 04:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.721 --> 05:11.223
So, are you and Amy
getting back together?

05:11.224 --> 05:14.125
If I don't sleep with any other women
for the rest of my life, maybe.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.634
Hi, Adrian.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.538
<i>* Falling in love *</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:35.009
<i>* Is such an easy
thing to do *</i>

05:35.010 --> 05:37.443
<i>* Birds can do it
We can do it *</i>

05:37.444 --> 05:40.179
<i>* Let's stop talking
Let's get to it *</i>

05:40.180 --> 05:41.814
<i>* Let's fall in love *</i>

05:48.137 --> 05:51.371
So she didn't call you?
No, she didn't call me, she texted me.

05:51.372 --> 05:53.039
Did they have a good time?
What?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.407
Just wondering.

05:54.408 --> 05:57.242
Just wondering because...

05:57.243 --> 05:59.911
Uh-huh. Because Grace wants to
know if they had a good time.

05:59.912 --> 06:02.646
No, not Grace, Ben.
Ben asked Grace to find out,

06:02.647 --> 06:05.282
and she asked me to find out,
and now I'm asking you.

06:05.283 --> 06:08.651
You know you're gonna tell me sooner or
later, so why don't you just tell me now?

06:08.652 --> 06:10.920
Give me something general,
like he slept in a hotel

06:10.921 --> 06:12.755
because they got into a huge
fight or something like that.

06:12.756 --> 06:15.424
He didn't sleep at a hotel.
He spent the night with her?

06:15.425 --> 06:17.192
You tricked me.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.861
And so what if they spent the
night in the same room together?

06:19.862 --> 06:21.195
So did we.
We didn't do anything.

06:33.806 --> 06:37.441
Hey. What are you
doing in here?

06:37.442 --> 06:39.443
Nothing.
Something.

06:39.444 --> 06:41.878
Nothing.
Is that your phone?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.046
This one? No.
This isn't my phone.

06:44.047 --> 06:46.048
This is Madison's phone.
She left it at home.

06:46.049 --> 06:48.450
I was just
returning it to her room.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.853
Are you reading
her text messages

06:51.854 --> 06:53.254
while you
return it to her room?

06:53.255 --> 06:55.423
I have a good reason.
Excuse.

06:55.424 --> 06:56.790
Lauren's dad called me.

07:14.404 --> 07:17.004
Hey, Dad.

07:17.005 --> 07:19.907
You startled me.
What are you doing here?

07:19.908 --> 07:22.442
I just came by to say hello
to you and your brother.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.947
Mom and David took Jason out
to get some stuff for med camp.

07:25.948 --> 07:27.948
He wants to look
all professional this year.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.484
Last year, apparently
he took a lot of shorts

07:30.485 --> 07:32.718
and no one
was wearing shorts, and...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.120
What'd I do?

07:35.121 --> 07:37.122
I don't know.
What did you do?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.924
I didn't do anything.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.693
Maybe you did,
and maybe you didn't,

07:40.694 --> 07:42.428
but when I was talking
to Jason yesterday,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.663
he said you spent the night
at Madison's Friday night.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.465
I've spent the night over at
Madison's lots of Friday nights.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.735
Yeah, but I don't think you spent the
night over there last Friday night.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.203
And before you say anything,

07:53.204 --> 07:56.006
let me ready you an e-mail
I got from you yesterday.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.209
"I hope no one finds out

07:59.210 --> 08:00.943
"we're at that guest house.

08:00.944 --> 08:02.878
"You better not tell anyone...

08:02.879 --> 08:04.846
"anyone... we're at
that guest house

08:04.847 --> 08:06.982
because my parents
would kill me."

08:06.983 --> 08:08.750
What guest house would that be?

08:08.751 --> 08:11.218
What e-mail would that be?

08:11.219 --> 08:14.555
The one obviously
intended for Madison.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.556
Rats.
How did I do that?

08:16.557 --> 08:19.425
I don't know,
but you did do that.

08:19.426 --> 08:21.360
What guest house?

08:21.361 --> 08:22.929
Jack's guest house.

08:22.930 --> 08:26.865
You spent the night at Jack's
guest house with Jessie.

08:26.866 --> 08:30.101
It wasn't quite like that.

08:30.102 --> 08:33.102
Whoa. Whoa.
Put that on hold.

08:33.104 --> 08:35.105
Who are you texting?
Madison?

08:35.106 --> 08:36.874
Yes.

08:36.875 --> 08:40.110
Lauren, I'm surprised at you.

08:40.111 --> 08:41.844
Me, too.

08:41.845 --> 08:44.480
What did you do?
Hey, Dad.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.782
Jason.
Get out of here.

08:46.783 --> 08:48.416
Don't you wanna see
my new shirts?

08:48.417 --> 08:49.617
No, I don't.

08:49.618 --> 08:52.486
Hi, Kenny.
How's it hanging?

08:52.487 --> 08:55.122
Hi, Dave.
Do you mind, both of you?

08:55.123 --> 08:57.257
I'd like a few minutes
to talk to my daughter alone.

08:57.258 --> 09:00.893
Is this a family matter?
Because Lauren's my daughter, too.

09:00.894 --> 09:03.028
Not really. No, she isn't.

09:03.029 --> 09:05.530
Not for purposes
of this discussion she's not.

09:06.799 --> 09:07.965
Ooh.

09:07.966 --> 09:09.700
You really stepped
in it, didn't you?

09:11.436 --> 09:12.436
What's going on?

09:12.437 --> 09:13.971
Jason, out.

09:13.972 --> 09:15.939
Bye.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.974
Is there a problem?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.275
I can handle it.

09:19.276 --> 09:21.276
I'm sure you can, but...

09:21.277 --> 09:23.812
Hey, surgeons don't operate

09:23.813 --> 09:26.147
on their own family members,
so maybe you shouldn't...

09:26.148 --> 09:29.049
Maybe I shouldn't what?

09:30.585 --> 09:34.788
Do you want me to stay here?
You want me to stick around?

09:34.789 --> 09:37.689
No, Dave.
Thanks, but no.

09:39.291 --> 09:42.258
Because if you want me...
She doesn't want you, Dave.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.468
Thank you for that.

09:51.469 --> 09:54.636
I really think this should
be between the two of us.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.272
You mean, between
the three of us, don't you?

10:01.476 --> 10:04.478
Dad and I need to talk,
just the two of us.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.380
Well, I'll decide that.

10:06.381 --> 10:09.015
Look, I just wanna talk
to my daughter, all right?

10:09.016 --> 10:11.250
So you came
all the way over to the house,

10:11.251 --> 10:14.353
unannounced, to talk
to our daughter about what?

10:18.123 --> 10:21.692
I spent the night with Jessie
over at Jack's guest house.

10:21.693 --> 10:24.261
But we didn't do anything.
You lied?

10:24.262 --> 10:27.697
You lied to me and told me that you
were spending the night at Madison's,

10:27.698 --> 10:29.966
so I don't know if I care

10:29.967 --> 10:33.335
if anything more
than that happened or not.

10:33.336 --> 10:36.338
You are on restriction,
young lady, for the summer.

10:36.339 --> 10:39.440
No Jessie, okay? The two of you
are not gonna spend this summer

10:39.441 --> 10:41.509
doing what I know
you want to do.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.410
So no Jessie.

10:44.579 --> 10:46.746
And next time, call.

10:46.747 --> 10:50.116
You're supposed to call me before
you just drop by over here.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.584
That's our agreement.

10:58.223 --> 11:00.691
I didn't do anything.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.598
They're right outside.
Put that down.

11:08.599 --> 11:10.833
I pay for the phone.
Put it down.

11:10.834 --> 11:14.269
Put it on the bed and back away,
Morgan, before anyone gets hurt.

11:15.938 --> 11:18.072
Uh, what's going on?

11:18.073 --> 11:20.875
Red alert from Lauren.
You tell me.

11:20.876 --> 11:23.210
What are you doing
with my phone?

11:23.211 --> 11:25.245
I'll let you two talk.
No, you can stay.

11:25.246 --> 11:28.114
I don't wanna be in the
middle of this one. What one?

11:28.115 --> 11:30.016
Were you reading
my text messages?

11:30.017 --> 11:33.252
I got a call from Lauren's dad asking
if she slept over here on Friday night.

11:33.253 --> 11:36.354
Um, I...

11:36.355 --> 11:39.057
slept over...

11:39.058 --> 11:41.425
not here Friday night.

11:42.761 --> 11:43.760
Where?

11:43.761 --> 11:47.230
You slept over where
on Friday night?

11:47.231 --> 11:50.199
Okay, I slept at Jack's guest
house, but we didn't do anything.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.934
I slept on the bottom bunk
with Lauren,

11:51.935 --> 11:54.102
and Jessie was on top.

11:54.103 --> 11:56.104
On the top bunk.

11:56.105 --> 11:59.740
And Jack was all the way across the
room in a chair and so was Tom.

11:59.741 --> 12:02.743
You lied. That's the thing, Madison.
You lied.

12:02.744 --> 12:05.245
All right. I... I lied,

12:05.246 --> 12:08.714
but only because I knew you wouldn't
let me do what I really wanted to do.

12:08.715 --> 12:10.416
Uh-oh.
And that would be?

12:10.417 --> 12:13.552
I want to go to Phoenix with Jack
for a week to visit his parents.

12:13.553 --> 12:14.553
No.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.521
Okay, that's it.

12:16.522 --> 12:18.289
That's the end of you and Jack
right there with that.

12:18.290 --> 12:19.390
Oh, no.

12:19.391 --> 12:20.724
What? Emily,

12:20.725 --> 12:22.659
if she wants to act
like a little child

12:22.660 --> 12:24.661
and stomp her foot
because she doesn't get her way,

12:24.662 --> 12:28.231
then she's certainly not old enough to
spend a week away with her boyfriend.

12:28.232 --> 12:30.566
She's not even old enough
to have a boyfriend.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.934
Morgan...
Emily.

12:31.935 --> 12:34.135
Well, you can't stop me.
Madison.

12:34.136 --> 12:36.137
Emily.
Really, Madison,

12:36.138 --> 12:38.472
you are just too young
to have a serious boyfriend,

12:38.473 --> 12:41.575
and you're too young
to have friends with babies.

12:41.576 --> 12:45.078
And you're not gonna have a baby because
you're not gonna see Jack anymore,

12:45.079 --> 12:46.412
and that is it.

12:46.413 --> 12:48.114
Can I have
my phone back, please?

12:52.952 --> 12:55.152
And who are you texting?
Lauren.

12:55.153 --> 12:57.188
To tell her that we're
not gonna be friends anymore.

12:57.189 --> 13:00.123
And you know what?
We're not gonna be friends anymore either.

13:00.124 --> 13:01.624
I don't wanna be your friend.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.327
I am not your friend.
I am your father.

13:33.118 --> 13:35.519
Hi, Amy.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.920
Hey, Lauren.
What's up?

13:36.921 --> 13:37.988
Nothing good.

13:37.989 --> 13:39.155
Oh.

13:39.156 --> 13:40.823
Well, I'm sorry
I didn't text you back.

13:40.824 --> 13:42.191
I just thought I'd call.
I miss you.

13:42.192 --> 13:44.226
My dad's over here.
He just screwed up

13:44.227 --> 13:45.827
my entire life in one visit.

13:45.828 --> 13:47.829
Your dad dad?
That one.

13:47.830 --> 13:50.698
How?
Oh, I e-mailed him by mistake.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.467
I was e-mailing him
and e-mailing Jessie

13:53.468 --> 13:56.803
and e-mailing Madison,
all of them one after the other.

13:56.804 --> 14:00.006
I guess an e-mail I thought I
sent to Madison went to him.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.874
Oh, that's too bad.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.542
I'm sorry.
What did it say?

14:04.544 --> 14:05.811
Oh, wait.
I have another call.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.579
Can you hang on?
It's probably just Madison.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.648
I'm glad you're still speaking to her,
because I'm not speaking to her.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.985
Oh, and you wanna
know something else?

14:13.986 --> 14:17.754
Amy? You there?

14:17.755 --> 14:20.090
And now he tells me that we can't
be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore

14:20.091 --> 14:22.459
because he thinks we're gonna do
something stupid like get pregnant.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.961
Yeah. That is a pretty
stupid thing to do.

14:25.962 --> 14:27.963
Can I call you back?
I have Lauren on the other line.

14:27.964 --> 14:31.299
Oh, that is so just like her
to try to get to you first.

14:31.300 --> 14:35.036
And I didn't mean stupid.
That was a bad choice of words.

14:35.037 --> 14:36.370
Uh...

14:36.371 --> 14:39.640
Hello? Amy?

14:39.641 --> 14:42.342
Hey.
Here you are.

14:42.343 --> 14:44.811
Oh, hi. I was just talking
to some friends back home.

14:44.812 --> 14:46.645
Hang up.
You're going out with us.

14:46.646 --> 14:49.014
Oh, no. It's okay.
I'm just gonna stay in tonight.

14:49.015 --> 14:51.350
Nope. We're not
taking no for an answer.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.852
You never go out.
Tonight you're going out.

14:53.853 --> 14:56.220
We're gonna take you
to that new club... Pajamas.

14:56.221 --> 14:59.990
And no admittance without
pajamas, so get dressed.

14:59.991 --> 15:02.826
Well, actually, undressed.
Go on. We're gonna wait for you.

15:04.628 --> 15:06.962
Lauren?

15:06.963 --> 15:08.931
Madison?

15:13.202 --> 15:15.636
All right, all right.
I'll just be a minute.

15:15.637 --> 15:18.138
And don't stop
to call John or Ricky or anyone.

15:18.139 --> 15:20.573
Let's go.
It's your night, Amy Juergens.

15:30.841 --> 15:32.274
Hey, there you guys are.

15:33.510 --> 15:36.479
Sorry. Those ladies
at the nursery love to chat.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.015
Can I help you with something?
Got it all under control.

15:39.016 --> 15:42.284
All right. If you don't mind, I'm gonna get
John ready for bed before dinner tonight

15:42.285 --> 15:45.020
'cause I need to run over to my apartment
and take care of some things later.

15:45.021 --> 15:46.922
I'll just be gone about an hour,
if that's okay.

15:46.923 --> 15:49.557
You taking him with you?
I'm gonna ask Ashley if she'll keep an eye on him.

15:49.558 --> 15:51.192
Okay. Let me know
how that goes.

15:51.193 --> 15:52.193
Yeah.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.529
I can't watch John tonight.
Hi, John.

15:55.530 --> 15:58.565
Say hi to Aunt Ashley.
Hi, Aunt Ashley.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.835
Why not?
I'll just be gone an hour.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.870
I don't have an hour.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.774
Ohhh.
It's a private conversation.

16:10.775 --> 16:12.308
We'll just cover our ears.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.806
I don't know why
you're so upset.

16:16.807 --> 16:18.473
I'm the one
who should be upset.

16:18.474 --> 16:20.137
You told everyone
I was in New York.

16:20.138 --> 16:21.805
You didn't have to do that.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.873
It wasn't anyone's business
if I was in New York.

16:23.874 --> 16:25.575
Your sister and I
needed to talk.

16:25.576 --> 16:27.343
Do you really think
you're in love with Amy?

16:27.344 --> 16:28.844
I don't know.

16:28.845 --> 16:30.679
All I know is I might
wanna find that out

16:30.680 --> 16:32.446
before she's in love
with someone else

16:32.447 --> 16:34.114
or I fall in love
with someone else,

16:34.115 --> 16:35.882
because your sister and I
have a baby together.

16:35.883 --> 16:38.251
And you really think
you're ready for a relationship?

16:38.252 --> 16:40.052
A monogamous relationship?
You?

16:40.053 --> 16:41.620
I might be.

16:42.856 --> 16:44.557
I could be.

16:44.558 --> 16:46.759
Yeah, you could be,
but that would mean

16:46.760 --> 16:48.761
that you'd have to commit
to being with Amy

16:48.762 --> 16:51.231
and only Amy
for the rest of your life.

16:51.232 --> 16:52.498
The rest of your life.

16:54.101 --> 16:56.202
Let me say that again.
The rest of your life.

16:56.203 --> 16:58.204
So?
So I doubt you're ready.

16:58.205 --> 17:01.540
All right.
That's what I need the hour for.

17:01.541 --> 17:04.375
I wanna go to therapy tonight.

17:04.376 --> 17:06.076
So, will you watch John or not?

17:06.077 --> 17:07.743
I'll watch him!

17:07.744 --> 17:10.244
I hate being in a house

17:10.246 --> 17:12.748
where everyone can hear
everything I'm saying.

17:19.221 --> 17:20.721
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

17:20.722 --> 17:22.856
You're welcome.

17:22.857 --> 17:24.858
Hi, honey. I'm home.

17:24.858 --> 17:26.526
So, how was it?

17:26.527 --> 17:28.527
It was great.
It was really great.

17:28.528 --> 17:31.129
I have so much stuff to tell you
that Donovan and I came up with.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.632
But how was your day?
Dull as dishwater, just like I like it.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.734
I don't know, George. I don't know
if you're really gonna be satisfied

17:36.735 --> 17:39.803
staying at home watching Robie
and cooking and cleaning.

17:39.804 --> 17:42.439
Who's staying at home?
We went to the park with Moose after you left

17:42.440 --> 17:44.574
and went to the pet store
and let Moose get some new toys.

17:44.575 --> 17:47.009
Then we came home and cleaned up
and had some lunch and took a nap.

17:47.010 --> 17:48.944
<i>Then we watched Oprah
while we folded some laundry.</i>

17:48.945 --> 17:50.779
Now he's sleeping, and I'm making dinner.
Piece of cake.

17:50.780 --> 17:53.882
<i>How did you find the time to go
to the park and watch Oprah?</i>

17:53.883 --> 17:56.617
<i>I never had the time to go to the
park and watch Oprah. I don't know.</i>

17:58.720 --> 18:00.620
<i>Is that bouillabaisse?
Oui.</i>

18:00.621 --> 18:03.989
I love you.
I love you.

18:03.990 --> 18:06.390
Oh, knock it off before no one
can enjoy the bouillabaisse.

18:07.826 --> 18:09.827
Why don't we tell her?

18:09.828 --> 18:11.428
What? No, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

18:11.429 --> 18:12.629
Oh, I hate surprises.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.230
Your dad and I
are getting married again.

18:15.365 --> 18:17.600
Like I said, I hate surprises.

18:17.601 --> 18:19.536
Well, it's not that big
of a surprise, is it?

18:19.537 --> 18:21.640
It's not such a big surprise
that you hate it, is it?

18:21.641 --> 18:24.643
No. It's more like I don't care.
No one cares.

18:24.644 --> 18:26.578
You're as married/divorced as
you were when you were married.

18:29.115 --> 18:31.149
So if you wanna get married
again, get married again.

18:31.150 --> 18:34.285
Thank you. I think we're going
to as soon as Amy gets back.

18:34.286 --> 18:35.986
Oh, something else
to look forward to.

18:37.455 --> 18:38.989
Let's call Amy and tell her.

18:38.990 --> 18:39.990
Yeah, more fun.

18:39.991 --> 18:41.991
You want to?
Let's do it.

18:41.992 --> 18:43.993
Do we have to?

18:43.994 --> 18:47.029
You know, every party has a pooper,
and that's what we invited you for.

18:47.030 --> 18:48.831
Party pooper, party pooper.

18:48.832 --> 18:52.569
<i>* 'Cause I'm ready *</i>

18:52.570 --> 18:55.171
<i>* To break free *</i>

18:59.741 --> 19:03.043
<i>* Comes to me *</i>

19:03.044 --> 19:06.313
<i>* I've been waiting *</i>

19:06.314 --> 19:08.882
Dad, is that you?

19:08.883 --> 19:10.984
Where are you?
I'm at a club.

19:10.985 --> 19:13.185
You're at a club?
At a club? Really?

19:13.186 --> 19:15.119
Who's at a club?
Amy.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.854
We just called
to tell you some good news.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.088
What's she doing at a club?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.327
Dad, I can't hear you.
Talk louder.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.362
What kind of club?
What kind of club?

19:24.363 --> 19:27.198
It's a pajama club.
You have to wear pajamas to get in.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.666
Pajama club. You have to wear
pajamas to get in. Interesting.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.667
Not really.
I'll be back.

19:33.502 --> 19:36.670
Amy, your dad and I
are getting married again.

19:36.671 --> 19:38.871
Really? Tonight?
No, not tonight.

19:38.872 --> 19:40.906
What?
I can't hear you.

19:40.907 --> 19:42.907
What?
Just hang up.

19:42.908 --> 19:44.575
Okay, Amy,
I'll talk to you later.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.910
I love you. Bye.

19:50.213 --> 19:52.180
So, when Amy gets back?

19:52.181 --> 19:54.116
When Amy gets back.

19:58.519 --> 20:00.085
<i>* Comes to me *</i>

20:02.221 --> 20:03.922
<i>* I've been waiting *</i>

20:03.923 --> 20:05.890
There you go, Lady Liberty.

20:05.891 --> 20:08.360
<i>* For so long *</i>

20:09.762 --> 20:12.766
<i>* Now I'm ready *</i>

20:23.559 --> 20:25.526
Need some help with that?

20:27.162 --> 20:28.662
No, I don't.

20:28.663 --> 20:31.331
But...thanks.

20:31.332 --> 20:33.665
You're welcome.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.700
I thought you were staying
home tonight with John.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.004
I thought that's why
you couldn't come over.

20:38.005 --> 20:40.172
Change of plans. See you.
Wait. Not so fast.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.310
How was New York?
New York was New York.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.178
I talked to Amy.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.814
Amy didn't tell you anything about New York.
I know she didn't.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.648
She didn't have to
tell me anything.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.583
I could read between the lines.

20:53.584 --> 20:56.686
And, well, she sounded as if...

20:56.687 --> 20:58.354
Never mind.

20:58.355 --> 21:00.456
As if what? I don't know.
It's just that...

21:00.457 --> 21:02.291
Just that what?

21:02.292 --> 21:03.792
I guess I can tell you.

21:03.793 --> 21:07.262
I mean, we're friends,
so why not?

21:07.263 --> 21:09.964
Look, I think maybe you confuse
Amy by going to see her.

21:09.965 --> 21:11.665
How's that?

21:11.666 --> 21:13.400
You know she loves Ben.

21:13.401 --> 21:15.535
She's always loved Ben, and now
she won't even speak to Ben.

21:15.536 --> 21:17.470
She wasn't speaking
to Ben anyway.

21:17.471 --> 21:19.337
I think that has something
to do with you, not me.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.172
It could, but...

21:21.173 --> 21:22.842
Look, I think someone
at the program

21:22.843 --> 21:24.843
told Amy she should be
with the father of her baby

21:24.844 --> 21:27.712
and that all girls should be
with the father of their babies,

21:27.713 --> 21:29.414
even if they're in love
with another guy.

21:29.415 --> 21:31.682
Did Amy say that?
Not exactly, no.

21:31.683 --> 21:35.051
But she's not...

21:35.052 --> 21:38.921
She's not trying to get you to marry
her or something like that, is she?

21:38.922 --> 21:41.890
I mean, that's what they probably
tell those girls at those programs...

21:41.891 --> 21:43.892
to get the baby's father
to marry them.

21:43.893 --> 21:45.827
I mean, that's what
my own father is telling me...

21:45.828 --> 21:47.495
to get Ben to marry me.

21:47.496 --> 21:50.964
But like I told you,
I would never marry Ben

21:50.965 --> 21:53.333
because he loves Amy,
and they belong together.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.668
And what?
We belong together?

21:55.669 --> 21:57.737
We don't belong
together, Adrian.

21:57.738 --> 21:59.738
I'd like to be friends
if that's possible,

21:59.739 --> 22:01.440
but we don't belong together.

22:01.441 --> 22:03.709
You're having Ben's baby,
not my baby.

22:03.710 --> 22:06.277
Ben's baby.
So maybe Ben and Amy

22:06.278 --> 22:08.212
weren't meant to be after all.

22:08.213 --> 22:12.082
And maybe like your father said,
you and Ben should get married.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.583
I think you should get married.

22:13.584 --> 22:16.185
How come you're moving
the baby seat out of the car?

22:16.186 --> 22:17.920
You going out?
I'm going to therapy.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.755
No, I don't think so.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.223
You don't move the baby seat out
of the car to go to therapy.

22:22.224 --> 22:23.958
You move the baby seat
out of the car

22:23.959 --> 22:25.893
when you're planning
on getting together with,

22:25.894 --> 22:28.761
well, whoever you can get
together with.

22:28.762 --> 22:30.396
I know you really well.

22:30.397 --> 22:32.097
Good night.

22:32.098 --> 22:36.333
Ricky, I know you, and I accept
who you are, unlike Amy.

22:36.334 --> 22:38.934
She is never gonna understand
you the way I understand you.

22:38.935 --> 22:41.403
Good. I'm glad, all right?

22:41.404 --> 22:45.006
I don't want her
to accept me or understand me.

22:45.007 --> 22:46.741
I want her to change me.

22:46.742 --> 22:48.409
No one can change you, Ricky.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.978
And no one can change you.
Good night.

23:05.789 --> 23:07.290
Hey, you coming with us?

23:07.291 --> 23:10.159
Oh, you're still here?
I thought you and Betty had left.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.960
No, it's still early.
You coming?

23:11.961 --> 23:14.562
No. I think I'm gonna go over
and see Grace tonight.

23:14.563 --> 23:16.964
Grace? Why is that?
I thought I might

23:16.965 --> 23:18.899
ask her opinion
about a ring for Adrian.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.567
A ring?
What kind of ring?

23:20.568 --> 23:22.801
You know what kind of ring.
I don't think I do.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.803
You can't be talking
about an engagement ring

23:24.804 --> 23:26.671
while you're walking around here
still crying

23:26.672 --> 23:29.273
'cause Amy hasn't called you and told
you all about last weekend with Ricky.

23:29.274 --> 23:30.441
I could be.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.109
You're gonna marry Adrian

23:32.110 --> 23:34.210
to get back at Amy
for not calling you?

23:34.211 --> 23:36.612
Did you not learn your lesson

23:36.613 --> 23:39.081
when you had sex with Adrian
to get back at Amy?

23:39.082 --> 23:41.516
Guess not.

23:45.653 --> 23:47.787
Wait until Amy gets home.

23:47.788 --> 23:49.788
Wait until you sit down
and talk to her.

23:49.789 --> 23:51.923
Clear the air,
give it some time,

23:51.924 --> 23:54.992
and as things go along, see how
you feel about Adrian, all right?

23:54.993 --> 23:56.960
No, not "all right."

23:56.961 --> 23:59.162
I'm just gonna marry Adrian
and get it over with.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.130
Not out of spite
you're not. Uh-uh.

24:01.131 --> 24:03.832
I thought that you and Ruben wanted
me and Adrian to get married.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.834
We do. But we want you and
Adrian to want to get married.

24:06.835 --> 24:10.470
If you don't wanna get married, it's not gonna
be a good marriage for either one of you.

24:10.471 --> 24:13.506
And you can't get married
out of spite, you hear me?

24:13.507 --> 24:15.141
I hear you.
But you know what?

24:15.142 --> 24:17.342
I'm a big boy now, and I'm
gonna do what I'm gonna do.

24:17.343 --> 24:19.310
Yeah, unless, of course,
I tell you you can't.

24:19.311 --> 24:22.612
You can't get married. When and if the
time is right, I'll go along with it.

24:22.613 --> 24:25.648
But I'm not gonna go along with it
right now under these circumstances.

24:25.649 --> 24:27.450
Then how's this?

24:27.451 --> 24:30.920
I accept that Amy and I are not
ever going to be together.

24:30.921 --> 24:33.456
Maybe because I'm having
a baby with Adrian,

24:33.457 --> 24:35.724
or maybe because
she had a baby with Ricky,

24:35.725 --> 24:39.427
or maybe for no reason at all other
than it was just never meant to be.

24:39.428 --> 24:42.997
But I'm going to suck it up,
I'm gonna be responsible,

24:42.998 --> 24:46.066
and I'm gonna marry the woman who's
gonna be the mother of my child.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.635
And unlike Ricky, I wanna do
that before the baby gets here.

24:48.636 --> 24:50.636
Unlike Ricky.
Unlike Ricky.

24:50.637 --> 24:53.005
You don't wanna be like Ricky.
I don't wanna be like Ricky.

24:53.006 --> 24:55.707
What's being or not being like
Ricky have to do with anything?

24:57.510 --> 25:00.978
Okay. Fine.
Don't be like Ricky.

25:00.979 --> 25:03.314
Go over to Adrian's house
and tell her father

25:03.315 --> 25:05.749
that you wanna marry her, 'cause
that's just what he wants to hear.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.784
You wanna do it, do it.
I change my mind.

25:07.785 --> 25:09.719
I'm not gonna stop you.
Go ahead.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.220
You wanna get married,
get married.

25:11.221 --> 25:13.356
For whatever reason or no
reason at all. I will.

25:13.357 --> 25:15.857
Go. Maybe after I
go over to Grace's.

25:15.858 --> 25:17.792
Yeah. Pick out the ring first.

25:17.793 --> 25:21.195
That's the important thing...
picking out the ring.

25:21.196 --> 25:22.963
That and trying
to put it on the finger

25:22.964 --> 25:24.731
of your best friend's
ex-girlfriend

25:24.732 --> 25:26.566
because he screwed up your life

25:26.567 --> 25:28.234
by getting
your girlfriend pregnant

25:28.235 --> 25:30.503
before she was even
your girlfriend.

25:30.504 --> 25:32.171
Hey, Benjamin.

25:32.172 --> 25:35.207
Uh, Leo, Bunny wants you
to call her before we go out.

25:35.208 --> 25:36.375
Really?
Mm-hmm.

25:36.376 --> 25:38.977
She called here at the house?
Mm-hmm. Yep.

25:38.978 --> 25:41.078
She said she didn't
wanna disturb you,

25:41.079 --> 25:43.147
and she said that she wanted

25:43.148 --> 25:46.516
to apologize
for what she had to do.

25:46.517 --> 25:48.184
Yep, that was the message...

25:48.185 --> 25:51.587
that she really wanted to talk
to you about what she had to do.

25:51.588 --> 25:53.589
What'd she have to do?
I don't know.

25:53.590 --> 25:55.424
What'd she have to do?

25:55.425 --> 25:57.525
I don't know.

25:57.526 --> 25:59.460
Are you sure you don't know?
You were at the shop all day.

26:01.363 --> 26:03.697
I guess she might be
referring to the fact

26:03.698 --> 26:06.266
that she had to let me go.

26:06.267 --> 26:09.402
Let you go where?
She fired you?

26:09.403 --> 26:12.438
You got fired from the family business...
a business with our name on it?

26:12.439 --> 26:14.173
For what?
Attacking Ricky.

26:14.174 --> 26:16.808
He wouldn't tell me what
happened with Amy last weekend.

26:16.809 --> 26:20.111
For the love of Pete.
Is he dead... Ricky?

26:23.081 --> 26:26.583
Because, well, if he is dead,

26:26.584 --> 26:28.651
she's gonna need Ben
more than ever.

26:30.053 --> 26:32.188
I mean, not that I would want
Ricky to be dead.

26:32.189 --> 26:34.189
It's just that if... if...

26:34.190 --> 26:35.857
Ricky isn't dead, is he?

26:35.858 --> 26:38.126
I mean,
is he hurt or something?

26:38.127 --> 26:41.295
Unfortunately, no.
He lives and lives on in John.

26:41.296 --> 26:43.297
So that's what's driving you
to get married.

26:43.298 --> 26:45.932
You got angry with Ricky and got
yourself fired from the job,

26:45.933 --> 26:47.968
and now you wanna get married.

26:47.969 --> 26:50.136
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, Ben,

26:50.137 --> 26:52.171
without losing my temper.

26:52.172 --> 26:54.573
Without really
losing my temper.

26:54.574 --> 26:57.175
And no one wants
to see me really lose my temper!

27:01.814 --> 27:04.215
Jeez, Ben.

27:04.216 --> 27:07.117
I'm really hungry.

27:07.118 --> 27:10.586
I mean, this probably means we're
not gonna go to dinner now.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.855
Probably.
I should've just told him.

27:12.856 --> 27:14.857
I thought I had more time
before he found out,

27:14.858 --> 27:18.126
and I'd use that time wisely
to do something stupid.

27:18.127 --> 27:19.627
Well, look, Ben,

27:19.628 --> 27:22.863
you can't just run around
and go attacking some guy

27:22.864 --> 27:25.765
because he's... he's with
a woman you can't have.

27:25.766 --> 27:27.300
You know?
Yeah, I know.

27:27.301 --> 27:30.536
And you can't run around
and marry some girl

27:30.537 --> 27:32.604
just because she's the woman
you can have.

27:32.605 --> 27:34.906
Yes, I can, Betty.

27:34.907 --> 27:37.942
Unfortunately, I can,
and I'm going to.

27:39.011 --> 27:40.044
Probably.

27:55.876 --> 27:57.577
Hey, Dr. Fields, right?

27:57.578 --> 27:59.211
Right. Aren't you...

27:59.212 --> 28:00.813
Leo Boykewich.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.314
Right.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.316
My daughter goes to school
with your son.

28:04.317 --> 28:06.884
Lauren. She's Amy Juergen's
best friend.

28:06.885 --> 28:09.819
Oh, right. Lauren.
Nice girl.

28:10.921 --> 28:13.188
So, how's the shrink business?

28:13.189 --> 28:15.424
A patient didn't show up.

28:15.425 --> 28:18.393
I had my own problems
I needed to deal with tonight,

28:18.394 --> 28:20.461
so I left my family
and went back to the office,

28:20.462 --> 28:22.863
and then the patient
doesn't show up.

28:22.864 --> 28:25.965
So the shrink business stinks.

28:25.966 --> 28:27.899
Thanks for asking.

28:30.469 --> 28:32.469
Nights like this make me think

28:32.470 --> 28:34.904
I should just quit
while I'm ahead.

28:34.905 --> 28:37.540
Not that I'm ahead, I mean.

28:37.541 --> 28:41.209
Nights like this make me think I
should get out of the meat business.

28:41.210 --> 28:43.711
My son, Ben,
got fired from his job

28:43.712 --> 28:45.746
at our butcher shop
this afternoon.

28:45.747 --> 28:47.715
I mean, he's obsessed
with Amy, and...

28:47.716 --> 28:49.517
You know,

28:49.518 --> 28:52.253
my daughter lied

28:52.254 --> 28:55.122
about where she was spending
the night Friday night.

28:55.123 --> 28:56.924
I found out, and now her mother

28:56.925 --> 28:59.993
has forbid her
from seeing this guy.

28:59.994 --> 29:02.962
I don't think she and this guy
were doing anything.

29:02.963 --> 29:04.563
I don't think
they were doing anything.

29:04.564 --> 29:08.700
It's just that she lied
about where she was.

29:08.701 --> 29:11.337
They weren't doing anything.

29:11.338 --> 29:13.339
They weren't.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.374
Why'd she lie?

29:16.710 --> 29:19.645
They wanted to spend
the night together.

29:19.646 --> 29:21.947
To do what?

29:21.948 --> 29:24.882
To do...nothing.

29:24.883 --> 29:27.318
I mean, what teenage boy isn't
gonna do it if he can do it?

29:28.853 --> 29:31.153
I wish it weren't true, but...

29:31.154 --> 29:33.354
Statistics say otherwise.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.091
Only half of teenagers
have sex in high school.

29:36.092 --> 29:38.359
What, and the other half
are girls?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.561
Who are all these boys
doing it with, huh?

29:40.562 --> 29:42.730
They're not all doing it.
They're not.

29:42.731 --> 29:45.132
That's how Ben
got into trouble.

29:45.133 --> 29:47.602
He had the chance,
he took it, and now...

29:47.603 --> 29:50.441
And now he's having a baby.

29:50.442 --> 29:53.810
I'm scared to death that's
what's gonna happen to Lauren,

29:53.811 --> 29:57.347
which is why I got upset
about her lying.

29:57.348 --> 30:00.182
But they weren't
doing anything.

30:00.183 --> 30:02.117
They weren't.

30:02.118 --> 30:06.622
Ben and Adrian had sex
to get back at Ricky and Amy.

30:06.623 --> 30:10.425
Now he actually wants to marry
Adrian to get back at Ricky and Amy.

30:10.426 --> 30:13.727
I mean, the two of them, if they wanted
to get married, that would be one thing.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.996
But to get married
out of spite.

30:15.997 --> 30:18.831
Can you believe that?
Married?

30:18.832 --> 30:22.433
My 16-year-old son is having a
baby and he wants to get married,

30:22.434 --> 30:24.101
and it all comes
from getting back

30:24.102 --> 30:26.904
at a ex-girlfriend
and his best friend.

30:26.905 --> 30:29.908
I mean, what kind
of marriage is that?

30:29.909 --> 30:33.245
What kind of life is that to be married
to someone you don't wanna be married to?

30:33.246 --> 30:35.114
How's your marriage going?

30:36.716 --> 30:38.384
You got married recently,
didn't you?

30:38.385 --> 30:40.519
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.720
And?

30:41.721 --> 30:44.722
We're happy.
We're very happy.

30:44.723 --> 30:48.190
Very happy.
Both of you?

30:48.191 --> 30:51.892
Look, I only answer
for myself, of course.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.459
You're very happy.

30:55.694 --> 30:57.627
You don't look very happy.

31:00.130 --> 31:03.564
You know, maybe I'll
call your office. Mmm.

31:03.565 --> 31:05.966
I'll tell you
what my problem is.

31:07.535 --> 31:09.536
I want my family back.

31:09.537 --> 31:11.403
I want my wife back.

31:11.404 --> 31:13.772
Yeah.

31:13.773 --> 31:16.708
Yeah, me, too.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.811
But in my case,
that's not possible.

31:19.812 --> 31:21.812
But in your case...

31:21.813 --> 31:23.247
She remarried.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.915
Oh. She's not dead, is she?

31:24.916 --> 31:26.249
No.

31:27.718 --> 31:29.318
No, she isn't.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.266
Come in.

31:43.267 --> 31:45.268
Oh. Hey, Ben.

31:45.269 --> 31:46.769
Grace isn't home.

31:46.770 --> 31:49.238
She and Grant went to pick
up some things for med camp.

31:49.239 --> 31:51.573
Or at least that's where
she said she was going.

31:51.574 --> 31:54.041
They're probably out somewhere
making out.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.276
Okay.
You can wait here if you want.

31:56.277 --> 31:57.910
Can I?
Yeah. Why not?

31:57.911 --> 32:00.446
It's not your house?

32:00.447 --> 32:03.081
Yeah, well, no one's home, so...
Mmm.

32:03.082 --> 32:05.885
Madison's dad
is making us break up.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.621
I'm thinking
about getting married.

32:09.622 --> 32:13.425
Oh, well, if you're thinking about marrying
Grace, you're out of luck, and so am I.

32:13.426 --> 32:15.526
I think she's in love
with this Grant guy.

32:15.527 --> 32:17.728
No, I'm not thinking about
marrying Grace.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.663
I'm thinking
about marrying Adrian.

32:19.664 --> 32:21.798
I just feel compelled
to marry her.

32:21.799 --> 32:24.167
Because of the baby?
Yeah. Sort of.

32:24.168 --> 32:26.002
And because I think it's unfair

32:26.003 --> 32:29.004
that Amy's getting back
together with Ricky.

32:29.005 --> 32:33.141
I mean, I think she is.
I have a feeling she is.

32:33.142 --> 32:35.510
Why couldn't I have just gotten
her pregnant instead of Adrian?

32:35.511 --> 32:37.445
Wasn't she already pregnant
when you met her?

32:37.446 --> 32:39.713
Yes. Yes, she was,

32:39.714 --> 32:41.915
but I fell in love
with her anyway.

32:44.551 --> 32:48.554
What is this, a meeting
of the lonely hearts club?

32:48.555 --> 32:51.322
We need to get out there
and get our women back.

32:51.323 --> 32:52.991
How are you supposed
to get Tammy back?

32:52.992 --> 32:54.725
Forget it.
She's married, Tom.

32:54.726 --> 32:57.828
Every relationship
can be broken.

32:57.829 --> 33:01.031
Not every relationship.
Not Ricky and Amy apparently.

33:01.032 --> 33:04.301
Every relationship.

33:04.302 --> 33:06.002
How'd I get myself into this?

33:06.003 --> 33:07.671
I just wanted to have some fun.

33:07.672 --> 33:09.406
Yeah, that's how most people
get into it.

33:11.675 --> 33:15.344
Where are your parents? They're at a medical
fund-raiser for some kids in Africa.

33:15.345 --> 33:18.014
And you're okay with this?
I'm okay with this.

33:18.015 --> 33:20.450
What is this?
We're just making out.

33:20.451 --> 33:21.986
We've made out before.

33:21.987 --> 33:23.555
Not with our shirts off.

33:23.556 --> 33:26.157
Uh, I said with your shirt off.

33:26.158 --> 33:28.893
Yeah, okay. What about pants?
Pants off?

33:28.894 --> 33:31.563
No. Pants on.
All pants stay on.

33:31.564 --> 33:33.565
Especially underpants,

33:33.566 --> 33:35.366
which I prefer to call knickers.

33:35.367 --> 33:36.735
Knickers, huh?

33:36.736 --> 33:38.937
How about knickers on
but pants off?

33:38.938 --> 33:42.106
Uh, I don't know
how I feel about that.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.310
You like to dance?

33:45.311 --> 33:47.246
We could have
a pants-off dance off.

33:48.515 --> 33:50.015
Really?

33:50.016 --> 33:51.850
That sounds fun.

33:51.851 --> 33:53.718
Or we could just dance,

33:53.719 --> 33:55.451
because I have a feeling
that if anything comes off,

33:55.452 --> 33:57.683
we'll get ourselves into a
situation we can't get out of.

33:57.684 --> 34:01.052
And what would that
situation be?

34:01.053 --> 34:02.921
That situation would be sex.

34:02.922 --> 34:04.188
Yeah.

34:05.524 --> 34:07.558
I don't wanna have sex.

34:07.559 --> 34:09.059
I wanna have sex,

34:09.060 --> 34:12.062
but it may be a little early
in the relationship to have sex.

34:12.063 --> 34:15.130
Besides, we have the whole
summer to have sex at med camp.

34:21.438 --> 34:24.306
Do they even check to see
if the car's in the driveway?

34:24.306 --> 34:26.509
No. They hear we're out
for the evening,

34:26.510 --> 34:28.409
and they think we're out
for the evening.

34:28.411 --> 34:29.710
Did you hear that?

34:29.712 --> 34:31.713
No, I didn't hear that.

34:31.714 --> 34:33.248
What didn't I hear?

34:33.248 --> 34:36.884
He said they have the whole
summer to have sex at med camp.

34:36.885 --> 34:39.587
Yeah, that's what he said...
that Grant.

34:39.588 --> 34:41.922
Well, he's right, you know?
They do.

34:41.922 --> 34:43.924
And that's part of
what med camp's for, you know?

34:43.925 --> 34:46.360
To get these young, would-be,
could-be doctors into bed together

34:46.360 --> 34:47.895
and get them ready
for medical school.

34:47.896 --> 34:50.264
What? I'm joking,
Kathleen, all right?

34:50.266 --> 34:52.335
I'm joking.
Look, teenagers

34:52.335 --> 34:54.672
don't need med camp as an excuse
to have sex with each other.

34:54.672 --> 34:57.408
No. They just need
a pants-off dance off.

34:57.409 --> 34:59.611
A what?
Yeah, that's what he suggested...

34:59.612 --> 35:01.679
a pants-off dance off.

35:02.948 --> 35:05.183
Interesting approach.

35:05.184 --> 35:07.718
Points for creativity.

35:07.719 --> 35:09.921
They're not gonna have sex, all right?
Not yet.

35:09.922 --> 35:10.955
You don't know that.

35:10.956 --> 35:12.457
Oh, I know that.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.325
Hey, Grace, we're home!

35:29.307 --> 35:30.808
Thank you.

35:32.310 --> 35:35.246
So, do you dance?

35:35.247 --> 35:36.881
Shut up.

35:47.459 --> 35:49.426
We can't do it again.
I have to go.

35:49.427 --> 35:51.461
You don't have to go.
I don't have to go.

35:51.462 --> 35:53.664
No one has to go anywhere
until we're ready to go.

35:53.665 --> 35:56.600
You said you only have an hour.
It's been an hour and a half.

35:56.601 --> 36:00.470
I know. But it was
really nice. Really.

36:00.471 --> 36:02.472
What happened in New York?

36:02.473 --> 36:04.206
Someone promise someone
he'd be faithful?

36:06.676 --> 36:09.744
Yeah. It makes me run
in the other direction, too.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.813
We didn't agree to be faithful.

36:12.814 --> 36:14.481
I'm not breaking
any promises here,

36:14.482 --> 36:16.116
and she's not breaking
any promises there.

36:16.117 --> 36:17.984
Even if she is out at a club?

36:17.985 --> 36:19.485
Even if she is.

36:19.486 --> 36:20.953
All we said was
we'd think about it.

36:20.954 --> 36:23.889
Well, I like the way you think.

36:28.327 --> 36:30.561
Good night, all right?

36:31.630 --> 36:33.632
I had a really nice time.

36:33.633 --> 36:35.066
Really nice.

36:36.468 --> 36:38.469
But I have to go.

36:38.470 --> 36:41.271
Call me, or don't call me.

36:45.609 --> 36:47.043
Good night.

36:48.879 --> 36:50.479
Good night.

37:16.808 --> 37:19.710
<i>No text from Ricky?</i>

37:19.744 --> 37:21.010
No.

37:21.045 --> 37:23.012
No text from Madison or Lauren?

37:23.046 --> 37:24.146
No.

37:24.180 --> 37:25.614
From your sister?
No.

37:25.648 --> 37:27.315
Not even from your mom or dad?

37:27.350 --> 37:29.517
No, but whatever.
I had a really nice time.

37:29.552 --> 37:32.153
You should have a picture.

37:32.187 --> 37:33.821
All right.

37:37.993 --> 37:39.659
Nice.

37:39.694 --> 37:41.995
What are you doing?
I'm sending it to Ricky.

37:42.029 --> 37:43.596
Whatever. Let's go.

37:43.630 --> 37:45.031
We have class tomorrow.
It's late.

37:45.065 --> 37:47.366
It's late.
We have class.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.134
We shouldn't have any fun.

37:49.168 --> 37:52.838
We're mommies.

37:52.872 --> 37:56.473
Enjoy it. The real world is coming
back sooner than you think.

38:07.751 --> 38:10.419
What are you doing here?

38:10.453 --> 38:11.720
Your dad let me in.

38:11.755 --> 38:13.089
Oh, did he?

38:13.123 --> 38:15.658
Hmm. Nice of him to ask me
if I wanted company.

38:15.692 --> 38:18.494
Sorry. But, uh,
I saw that your light was on,

38:18.529 --> 38:22.031
and I left my phone at home, and I was out
driving around, thinking about things,

38:22.065 --> 38:23.933
and I just felt
like seeing you.

38:23.967 --> 38:25.434
So Amy still didn't
call you, huh?

38:25.469 --> 38:26.936
No.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.404
She might if
you had your phone.

38:28.438 --> 38:30.506
No, I don't think so.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.575
I'll just wait to talk to her
when she gets back.

38:32.609 --> 38:33.776
Mm-hmm.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.578
So I guess you talked to Ricky?

38:35.612 --> 38:37.280
I saw him out
in front of the house.

38:37.314 --> 38:39.882
Be careful. The front of
the house can be trouble.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.951
Yeah, it can be.

38:42.986 --> 38:45.086
But as far as Ricky goes,

38:45.121 --> 38:47.222
I think that trouble is over.

38:47.256 --> 38:49.124
I'm over him.
Are you?

38:49.158 --> 38:50.592
Maybe.

38:51.961 --> 38:55.063
Look, Ben, we've been
acting like idiots

38:55.097 --> 38:57.566
because we're not ready
to let go of Amy and Ricky.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.001
And as ridiculous as that is,
it's true.

39:00.036 --> 39:01.536
Yeah.

39:02.738 --> 39:04.505
Here's what I'm thinking.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.075
And don't think that I don't
care for you, because I do.

39:07.109 --> 39:08.543
And I care for you,

39:08.577 --> 39:11.612
but let's face it, we're not
in love with each other.

39:11.647 --> 39:16.050
No. So what would happen
if we got engaged?

39:17.619 --> 39:19.754
What would happen if Amy and Ricky
thought that we were gonna be

39:19.788 --> 39:21.823
unavailable to them
for the rest of our lives?

39:21.857 --> 39:24.792
Okay, if you give me a ring,

39:24.827 --> 39:27.795
I think my dad might insist
you marry me.

39:27.830 --> 39:29.797
I would know
it was a fake engagement,

39:29.832 --> 39:31.999
and you would know
it was a fake engagement,

39:32.034 --> 39:34.335
but if no one else knew
it was a fake engagement

39:34.369 --> 39:36.971
and my father
thought it was real,

39:37.005 --> 39:39.140
I just don't know
if you could get out of it,

39:39.174 --> 39:40.775
or if we could get out of it.

39:40.809 --> 39:43.745
I'd be willing to take that chance.
Would you?

39:57.627 --> 39:59.994
I think you should
text them all.

40:00.029 --> 40:02.363
No. I don't care,
really.

40:02.398 --> 40:04.599
You do, too, care.
And you know what?

40:04.633 --> 40:06.534
You should say that you care.

40:06.569 --> 40:09.404
You should say how you feel.
You should let people know.

40:09.438 --> 40:12.172
If you are upset about something,
you need to let them know.

40:12.207 --> 40:14.808
That's what we've been
talking about in group.

40:14.843 --> 40:16.844
Been talking about
not trying to be perfect

40:16.878 --> 40:19.280
just because
we totally screwed up.

40:19.314 --> 40:21.782
I mean, we still have feelings,

40:21.816 --> 40:24.284
and some of those feelings
towards people are not so great.

40:24.319 --> 40:28.188
Your feeling towards your friends
and family tonight, for example.

40:28.223 --> 40:31.091
I mean, you could
let them know in a nice way,

40:31.126 --> 40:32.826
but you should let them know.

40:34.029 --> 40:37.464
Here. Let me take
another picture...

40:37.498 --> 40:41.434
a picture that you
can send to everyone.

40:41.469 --> 40:45.371
And put "Happy birthday to me"
as the subject.

40:45.406 --> 40:46.306
I don't know.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.707
Do it.

40:50.377 --> 40:53.511
Wait. It's Ricky.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.450
That's sweet, but why
would he send me that?

40:59.484 --> 41:00.884
I'll tell you why.

41:00.919 --> 41:03.720
Because he thinks you're
out at a club having fun

41:03.755 --> 41:06.089
while poor Ricky
is home alone with John,

41:06.124 --> 41:07.825
which I doubt, by the way.

41:07.859 --> 41:10.427
He probably just got home.

41:10.462 --> 41:12.696
That sounds about right.

41:38.689 --> 41:40.957
Happy birthday, Amy.
