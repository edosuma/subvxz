04:41.814 --> 04:43.782
No.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.478
- You're dead.
- Go.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.346
There's others.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.965
Halt.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.836
What are you thinking?

07:22.909 --> 07:26.504
- Where am l?
- Wrong answer. What are you thinking?

07:28.981 --> 07:33.179
- l'm thinking about getting outta here.
- Wrong answer.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.253
No sleeping.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.770
What are you thinking?

07:55.441 --> 07:58.376
About my son. About his mother.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.208
Wrong answer. What are you thinking?

08:01.314 --> 08:04.147
- What do you want from me?
- Wrong answer.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.988
l want answers.
You hear me? l want answers.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.471
No sleeping.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.677
Did you hear me?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.308
Yes.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.420
What are you thinking?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.854
- What should l be thinking?
- You're a guilty man.

08:50.930 --> 08:54.991
You entered a government facility illegally
in search of nonexistent information.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.331
- You failed in every respect.
- Yes.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.871
Say it.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.931
l am a guilty man.

09:03.009 --> 09:08.948
l failed in every respect. l deserve
the harshest punishment for my crime.

09:31.370 --> 09:36.239
- How long has he been here?
- l've been trying to get someone to say.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.310
- Who called you?
- Kersh's office.

09:39.378 --> 09:43.314
- Who called them?
- l just know that Mulder's being held here.

09:43.382 --> 09:47.216
- What for?
- For the murder of a military man.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.434
Mulder.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.444
Dana.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.584
Oh, my God.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.797
Are you OK?

10:38.871 --> 10:40.964
Am l OK?

10:41.841 --> 10:45.937
Mulder, l haven't seen you
in such a long time.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.037
l was so worried.

10:49.048 --> 10:53.610
lt's OK. l'm all right.
They're treating me really well in here.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.787
What's happened to you?

10:56.856 --> 11:00.348
Nothing. l'm squared away.

11:02.662 --> 11:07.122
Hey, Walter. lt's good to see you.

11:07.199 --> 11:11.693
- Have they told you what the charges are?
- Yeah, we're clear on that.

11:11.771 --> 11:15.332
- You're clear on what?
- My crimes.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.008
- Mulder...
- l murdered a man, Dana.

11:21.080 --> 11:27.019
l went looking for something that didn't exist
and l made a terrible mistake.

11:27.553 --> 11:31.353
l should be punished severely.

11:32.425 --> 11:38.091
Whatever you were doing, you have the right
to a lawyer, to an inquiry and process of law.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.827
- l don't think you heard me.
- Time's up.

11:44.370 --> 11:49.603
- We're going to get you out of here.
- How's that? l'm a guilty man.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.371
Time's up. Let's go.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.440
Excuse me.

12:20.039 --> 12:24.271
l don't understand. Why are you helping me?

12:27.546 --> 12:31.380
- Because you can't do this alone.
- Let's go.

12:35.721 --> 12:39.316
- You saw him? Mulder?
- They've accused him of murder?

12:39.425 --> 12:43.088
- And they have him believing that he did it.
- Of murdering who?

12:43.162 --> 12:46.893
- Knowle Rohrer.
- Knowle Rohrer?

12:46.966 --> 12:52.268
- lt can't be. l watched Knowle Rohrer die.
- He can't die. He's a super-soldier.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.239
Mulder sidestepped security
at Mount Weather,

12:55.307 --> 12:58.299
where our so-called
shadow government is installed.

12:58.410 --> 13:04.576
- What about this murder charge?
- 30 government workers are ready to testify.

13:04.650 --> 13:08.108
Killing a man who can't be killed?

13:11.657 --> 13:13.750
Where are you going?

13:14.693 --> 13:17.594
To beg mercy with the man upstairs.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.302
Come in.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.276
Deputy Director Kersh.

13:41.153 --> 13:45.681
l've just been going over my notes
of this whole business. Please, have a seat.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.158
Thank you.

13:50.896 --> 13:54.332
We've both got a problem
with this man of yours, Agent Mulder.

13:54.400 --> 13:59.565
Mulder's been a running problem for the FBl,
but nothing this serious.

13:59.638 --> 14:04.940
l've been asked by a female agent,
Mulder's closest associate,

14:05.010 --> 14:07.444
to beg mercy of the military court,

14:07.513 --> 14:12.507
to give Mulder every consideration
based on his good character.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.112
- You've reviewed the charges, yes?
- Yes.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.679
There's a charge of murder.

14:19.558 --> 14:25.258
This'd look bad for the marines
if it didn't look worse for the FBl.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.867
What does Mulder intend to plead?

14:32.838 --> 14:35.864
You wanted a chance to clear up this mess,

14:35.941 --> 14:39.308
and l'm going to give it to you,
give it to the FBl.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.777
How?

14:40.846 --> 14:45.647
A fair hearing for your agent
by his own agency.

14:45.718 --> 14:50.178
Your prosecutor, yourjudges.
Held in my court.

14:50.923 --> 14:54.359
That can't be legal.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.953
- Why do this?
- l want a verdict.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.862
A guilty verdict.

15:04.937 --> 15:09.772
This man Mulder has made a lot of enemies.
He's a crusader.

15:09.875 --> 15:13.038
And a lot of people do not like the crusade.

15:18.317 --> 15:22.913
- l can't do that.
- You'll do it, Deputy Director.

15:23.622 --> 15:29.492
You and l both know there are forces
inside the government now

15:29.595 --> 15:32.826
that a man would be foolish to disobey.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.279
Mulder.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.291
Mulder.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.300
l smelled you coming, Clarice.

16:20.145 --> 16:25.014
Dammit, Mulder. lt's not funny
to see you putting on that act.

16:25.117 --> 16:31.352
That is funny. What's not funny is what they
do to you in here if you don't put on that act.

16:57.383 --> 17:04.380
- Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man.
- You're gonna be kissing your ass goodbye.

17:04.490 --> 17:10.395
l kinda gathered that.
Right around the 50th brainwashing session.

17:10.496 --> 17:15.330
- Why are they doing this to you?
- They're preparing me for my testimony.

17:15.401 --> 17:18.733
Your testimony won't matter
with the case they're building.

17:18.837 --> 17:20.896
Not building - rigging.

17:21.006 --> 17:24.339
l don't think you understand
the seriousness of the charges.

17:24.410 --> 17:29.279
This isn't some routine wrist-slapping.
You're on trial for your life.

17:29.381 --> 17:34.080
My trial's a foregone conclusion. They want
me to admit my guilt and help them out.

17:34.186 --> 17:38.680
- What's really on trial here is the truth.
- They're saying you killed a man.

17:38.757 --> 17:41.351
Have they produced a body?

17:43.929 --> 17:47.797
You can't produce a body
because you can't kill a man who won't die.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.928
Body or not, they've got 30 witnesses
ready to testify against you.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.563
We'll get you the best lawyer.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.369
To defend a man who believes in aliens
against the FBl and the military?

18:01.447 --> 18:05.816
lt's never gonna happen.
Skinner can defend me.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.148
l can't represent you.

18:08.253 --> 18:14.624
You know all the facts, the government
conspiracy. More than that, l trust you.

18:14.726 --> 18:15.420
Mulder...

18:15.494 --> 18:18.793
They can't try me
without exposing themselves.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.161
l know what l'm doing.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.973
Now it's a party.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.303
Agent Mulder.

18:31.410 --> 18:36.279
- What's the matter?
- The military just got back to us.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.441
You ready for this?

18:39.184 --> 18:46.147
l know this is impossible, but they're saying
they've got Knowle Rohrer's body.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.882
Mulder, it's me.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.151
- ls it time to go?
- No.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.314
That's why l'm here.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.963
l need you to talk to me,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.559
confide in me,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.031
or we'll lose.

19:34.139 --> 19:39.839
We can't win, Scully.
We can only hope to go down fighting.

19:40.579 --> 19:43.343
You're scaring me.

19:44.883 --> 19:51.812
Mulder, l'm so scared that l've just got
you back and now l'm gonna lose you again.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.688
l know what l'm doing.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.257
Whatever you're doing,

20:05.370 --> 20:09.397
you have no idea
how much has already been lost,

20:11.009 --> 20:13.068
what l've had to do.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.245
l do know.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.840
Skinner told me.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.591
Our son, Mulder.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.922
l gave him up.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.123
Our son.

20:37.703 --> 20:42.299
l was so afraid you could never forgive me.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.967
l know you had no choice.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.646
l just missed both of you so much.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.924
Where have you been?

21:00.459 --> 21:02.950
Where have you been hiding?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.989
ln New Mexico.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.999
Doing what?

21:12.004 --> 21:14.802
Looking for the truth.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.781
You found something, didn't you?

21:35.260 --> 21:37.319
What did you find?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.165
l can't tell you.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.660
You found something in that facility.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.765
That's what you were doing, right?

21:53.111 --> 21:56.979
- What did you find out there?
- l can't tell you.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.644
That doesn't make sense.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.882
You gotta trust me, Scully.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.220
l know things it's better you don't.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.922
Assistant Director Skinner.

22:42.027 --> 22:46.862
Special Agent Kallenbrunner. l'll be handling
the prosecution. l'm out of the LA field office.

22:46.932 --> 22:53.235
- How'd you get this assignment?
- l was a federal prosecutor. And you?

22:53.338 --> 22:55.568
That's a good question.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.760
Let's bring in the defendant.

23:24.870 --> 23:28.772
This proceeding is called to order.

23:28.874 --> 23:34.039
- Mr Kallenbrunner, you may proceed.
- l have no witnesses to call.

23:34.112 --> 23:39.311
l will submit to the court, however, sworn
testimony of 30 people who saw the crime.

23:41.319 --> 23:42.581
Assistant Director.

23:42.654 --> 23:47.091
l move to dismiss these proceedings
on the grounds that it is not a fair trial.

23:47.159 --> 23:51.926
l'm not a lawyer, you're not ajudge,
this is not a court of law.

23:51.997 --> 23:58.766
This is a military court of law. Familiarize
yourself with title 10 of the US Code.

23:58.837 --> 24:02.933
- But l suggest you call a witness.
- Then l move to delay this trial.

24:03.008 --> 24:08.139
My central witness, Marita Covarrubias,
works for the UN and l can't locate her.

24:08.246 --> 24:11.238
And l've received no help
from the US government.

24:11.316 --> 24:16.015
l have to deny that request.
Do you have another witness, Mr Skinner?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.749
l'll call a witness, but l do so under protest.

24:18.824 --> 24:22.590
Both the panel's judgments and rulings
are sovereign.

24:22.661 --> 24:25.755
- There is no record.
- Excuse me?

24:25.831 --> 24:30.291
This isn't a secret tribunal, as you
so kindly informed me. lt's a court of law.

24:30.368 --> 24:34.031
Military court of law, Mr Skinner.

24:34.139 --> 24:38.132
lt's OK. Try your case.

24:42.681 --> 24:45.548
Please state your name for the court.

24:45.650 --> 24:49.313
My name is Dana Katherine Scully.

24:49.387 --> 24:54.484
l was assigned nine years ago
to the X-Files to spy on Agent Mulder,

24:54.559 --> 24:58.495
whose methods the FBl distrusted.

24:58.563 --> 25:04.866
Assigned notjust as an agent
but as a medical doctor, a scientist.

25:04.970 --> 25:10.408
And, as a serious scientist, you came
to believe in Agent Mulder's theories.

25:10.509 --> 25:15.208
l came to believe in the existence
of extraterrestrial life

25:15.313 --> 25:21.843
and in a conspiracy inside the government
to keep their existence a secret.

25:22.921 --> 25:28.757
The proof was overwhelming.
lt was even scientifically undeniable.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.819
l believe, as do many respected scientists,

25:34.766 --> 25:40.705
that life came to earth millions of years ago
from a meteor or a rock from Mars.

25:40.772 --> 25:47.905
So what you're saying is life, human life,
is extraterrestrial by definition.

25:48.013 --> 25:52.279
Objection. What does this nonsense
have to do with Mulder murdering a man?

25:52.384 --> 25:57.048
Agent Scully will prove a conspiracy exists
to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.

25:57.122 --> 26:01.286
You are not here proving
government conspiracies, Mr Skinner.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.625
- You are here to defend Fox Mulder.
- And l'm trying to do that.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.426
lt's your case, Mr Skinner.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.233
So a meteor crashed to earth.

26:15.307 --> 26:21.542
But along with the biological building blocks,
there was something else. An alien virus.

26:21.613 --> 26:26.573
l believe there was a virus
which thrived here prehistorically.

26:26.651 --> 26:33.113
l believe that virus infected early man
and transformed his physiology.

26:33.224 --> 26:39.459
- Changed him into something else.
- lnto an alien life form himself.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.998
What happened to these aliens?

26:42.100 --> 26:46.503
They died in the last lce Age,
35,000 years ago.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.163
And the virus?

26:48.273 --> 26:51.333
lt lay dormant, underground,

26:51.443 --> 26:56.278
until it surfaced once again
during our current geologic period.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.748
And the government knows of this.

26:58.817 --> 27:04.778
The government learned of this virus in 1947,

27:04.856 --> 27:08.690
when a UFO crashed in Roswell, New Mexico.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.193
The UFO crash revealed the virus.

27:11.296 --> 27:17.166
The virus thrived underground
in petroleum deposits, in black oil.

27:17.268 --> 27:21.034
lt has sentience. lt can think.

27:21.139 --> 27:26.167
lt has the ability to communicate,
and it communicated with the UFOs.

27:26.277 --> 27:29.007
And the government knows this, too.

27:34.152 --> 27:40.455
ln Roswell, they captured aliens
from the spacecraft wreckage.

27:40.525 --> 27:44.689
They salvaged various
alien technology from them,

27:44.796 --> 27:50.393
and from their data banks they learned
of the alien plan to recolonize the earth.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.130
ls this all leading anywhere?

27:53.204 --> 27:56.196
Yeah. The destruction of mankind.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.867
l'll warn you once, Agent Mulder.

28:03.648 --> 28:08.176
What did the government do
with this information of an alien takeover?

28:08.253 --> 28:11.188
They kept it a dark secret.

28:11.256 --> 28:14.350
lf it had gotten out,
there would have been wild panic.

28:14.426 --> 28:18.920
- Mr Skinner, are we finished?
- No. There's Agent Scully's abduction.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.897
- Abduction by whom?
- By the military.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.764
Working with the government conspirators

28:24.869 --> 28:31.274
to develop a breed of human-alien hybrids
that the aliens would use as a slave race.

28:32.444 --> 28:37.541
Thank you, Agent Scully.
Your witness, Mr Kallenbrunner.

28:41.419 --> 28:46.413
All these ETs, it's hard to keep
these aliens straight without a scorecard.

28:46.524 --> 28:50.517
l myself have never seen an alien.
Could we call one as a witness?

28:50.595 --> 28:55.225
- You're being facetious.
- No. l'd just like to see some proof.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.736
- There are the Mars rocks...
- No. l need something good.

28:58.803 --> 29:02.534
Something amazing. Something really cool.

29:03.808 --> 29:08.575
- l don't know what you mean.
- You have no proof to back up one word.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.880
lsn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers
and you had his love child?

29:14.953 --> 29:18.389
- Objection.
- Thank you. Next witness.

29:57.162 --> 30:00.131
Can you state your full name?

30:00.198 --> 30:01.961
Jeffrey Frank Spender.

30:06.704 --> 30:12.438
l know you didn't hear Mr Kallenbrunner,
but he'd like to make a mockery of the X-Files.

30:12.510 --> 30:16.002
- You worked on the X-Files yourself.
- Until three years ago.

30:16.114 --> 30:20.107
When you were shot
in the X-Files office by your own father.

30:20.185 --> 30:23.450
Can you please tell the court
exactly who your father was?

30:23.521 --> 30:27.048
He led the government conspiracy
to exploit the existence of aliens.

30:27.158 --> 30:31.151
Objection. There's no
government conspiracy established here.

30:31.229 --> 30:34.289
l agree. l don't see where this is going.

30:34.365 --> 30:40.031
lf l can prove this conspiracy, it will justify
Mulder's actions and you will have to acquit.

30:40.138 --> 30:45.542
l hope this isn't the entire basis
of your defense, Mr Skinner.

30:51.015 --> 30:54.382
You have a relationship
to Agent Mulder, don't you?

30:54.485 --> 30:58.922
He's my half-brother.
His mother had an affair with my father.

30:59.023 --> 31:03.187
But he never knew that,
not until he met you at the FBl.

31:03.261 --> 31:07.027
He didn't know both his father and mine
were in the alien conspiracy.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.532
His father was a reluctant member.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.570
When Agent Mulder began to know the truth,

31:12.670 --> 31:16.697
my father had his father killed
by an assassin named Alex Krycek.

31:16.774 --> 31:19.504
He killed him to silence him?

31:19.577 --> 31:22.045
Mulder's father lived his life in shame.

31:22.113 --> 31:27.517
Not for the conspiracy
but for a terrible decision he made.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.780
lnvolving Agent Mulder's sister.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.255
The aliens distrusted
their human collaborators.

31:33.358 --> 31:37.954
Members of the conspiracy were made
to surrender family members as collateral.

31:38.062 --> 31:45.594
So Mulder's father gave up Mulder's sister,
his own eight-year-old daughter.

31:45.703 --> 31:50.265
Mulder witnessed his sister being abducted
by aliens. lt haunted him.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.970
lt's why he pursued the X-Files.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.639
- What became of her? Samantha?
- She was returned.

31:57.749 --> 32:02.209
She was sent to California
where we were raised together.

32:03.721 --> 32:08.488
She was taken many more times
and suffered horrible tests.

32:09.160 --> 32:15.224
Mulder spent years looking for her, several
times thinking he'd found her. He was tricked.

32:15.300 --> 32:21.170
Samantha was part of the cloning experiment
done by the conspiracy.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.570
She herself died in 1987.

32:29.514 --> 32:32.813
By your own father's hand, essentially.

32:32.917 --> 32:36.853
l went to work for the FBl.
l didn't know of my father's crimes.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.321
When l stood up to him, he shot me.

32:39.424 --> 32:44.760
When l didn't die, he subjected me
to the same horrible tests.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.193
Your witness.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.208
Mr Spender,

33:00.311 --> 33:02.836
l'm sorry for your suffering.

33:02.947 --> 33:08.010
l'm sure none of us
can really imagine what it's like.

33:08.119 --> 33:14.024
- Your father must be brought to justice.
- l believe my father is dead.

33:19.530 --> 33:23.660
Mr Spender, you're here to speak
for the character of Agent Mulder.

33:23.735 --> 33:28.399
ln reports you filed while an FBl agent,
l see here you describe Mulder as:

33:28.506 --> 33:33.739
arrogant, difficult, a control freak,
widely disliked by his peers.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.177
They were written before l knew the truth.

33:36.247 --> 33:40.684
This report calls him unstable,
prone to violent outbursts.

33:41.652 --> 33:45.884
l have the report right here,
if your memory needs refreshing.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.557
Thank you, Mr Spender.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.922
You found out about Mulder?

34:30.034 --> 34:32.764
You found out he's in trouble?

34:41.946 --> 34:44.039
l'll get ready now.

35:04.068 --> 35:09.165
l know why you're here and what you want.
l can't give it to you.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.901
Make them a deal, Mulder.

35:11.976 --> 35:15.810
Guilty on a lesser charge.
Maybe they'll let you walk outta here.

35:15.913 --> 35:19.815
- l'd rather die, Scully.
- How can you say that?

35:19.917 --> 35:24.820
- How can you say that to me?
- Because this is greater than you or me.

35:24.922 --> 35:30.986
This is about everything we've worked for,
the truth we've sacrificed so much to uncover.

35:31.095 --> 35:33.996
Then expose it, Mulder. Take the stand.

35:34.098 --> 35:38.933
Whatever it is that you're withholding,
take the stand and hit them full force.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.971
l can't.

35:41.038 --> 35:44.633
- Why?
- l just can't.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.140
You say this is greater than us,
and maybe it is,

35:51.215 --> 35:54.810
but this is us fighting this fight,
Mulder, not you.

35:54.886 --> 36:00.518
lt's you and me. That's what l'm fighting for,
Mulder, you and me.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.075
Get up.

36:27.919 --> 36:31.150
Who's that? Who's there?

36:38.095 --> 36:43.089
- What are you doing here?
- That's what l'm here to ask you.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.837
l'm putting the truth on trial.

36:47.905 --> 36:49.998
What truth?

36:50.074 --> 36:52.167
Whose truth?

36:53.110 --> 36:57.012
- You think these men will even hear it?
- They're afraid to hear it.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.174
They're not afraid.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.917
They have too much power to be afraid.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.456
You're going to learn that, just like l did.

37:06.557 --> 37:10.789
- You'll die learning it.
- l'm not afraid of that.

37:10.895 --> 37:15.559
There's a truth even you're afraid
to speak now because you know it's futile.

37:15.633 --> 37:19.296
No. Because l refuse to accept it.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.701
Then you're going to need help.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.605
How can you possibly help me?

37:46.564 --> 37:50.796
They said this is where
l could find the body, at Fort Marlene.

37:50.901 --> 37:53.062
Right.

37:53.137 --> 37:58.905
The deceased's name is Knowle Rohrer,
former marine, last employed by the DOD.

37:58.976 --> 38:04.175
l don't wanna call back.
l wanna talk to your superior...

38:04.282 --> 38:07.342
Son of a bitch hung up on me.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.250
There's somebody in your yard.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.354
- Where is he?
- He's at the back door.

38:30.441 --> 38:32.932
Got him. He's coming around.

38:41.986 --> 38:46.286
Stay where you are.
Federal agent. Hands in the air.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.859
Who are you? What are you doing
skulking around my house?

38:56.967 --> 38:59.800
l didn't wanna be seen.
l don't wanna endanger him.

38:59.870 --> 39:05.206
- Who are you talking about?
- Someone who wants to help Mulder.

39:20.891 --> 39:25.225
- State your full name for the court.
- Marita Covarrubias.

39:25.329 --> 39:28.321
And your former government title?

39:28.399 --> 39:31.664
Special representative
to the secretary general of the UN.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.397
The United Nations.

39:33.504 --> 39:40.171
A position giving you unrestricted access
to countries and leaders around the world?

39:40.244 --> 39:42.371
Yes.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.710
How did you use this power?

39:45.549 --> 39:51.044
To further the interests of a secretive group
of men who called themselves the Syndicate.

39:51.122 --> 39:54.023
What were their interests?

39:54.091 --> 39:59.188
Developing an alien virus vaccine.
Before the Russians developed one.

39:59.263 --> 40:01.891
How'd they go about that?

40:01.966 --> 40:05.629
By testing innocent civilians
all over the world.

40:05.736 --> 40:11.641
Test subjects were tracked through DNA
identifiers in smallpox vaccination scars.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.768
- Without the subjects' knowledge?
- Mostly.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.211
Some developed suspicions.

40:17.281 --> 40:20.546
l saw Russians who cut off their arms
to prevent being tracked.

40:20.618 --> 40:23.951
As they did to an American man
you worked with.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.648
Yes. Alex Krycek.

40:28.492 --> 40:32.895
Did you believe in the Syndicate
and their international conspiracy?

40:32.963 --> 40:35.989
No. l was paid for my access.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.898
- ln fact, you came to hate them.
- Yes.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.938
lt's why l helped Agent Mulder
when he approached me.

40:42.006 --> 40:47.444
But you were found out
and the Syndicate punished you for this.

40:52.116 --> 40:57.679
They turned me into a test subject.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.621
Testing what?

41:00.691 --> 41:06.220
They were pretending to work with the aliens
to infect the population with an alien virus,

41:06.297 --> 41:09.198
but the conspirators
were trying to save themselves

41:09.266 --> 41:12.429
by secretly and selfishly
developing a vaccine.

41:12.503 --> 41:16.803
The conspirators believed
all life in the universe had been infected,

41:16.874 --> 41:21.811
including a race of alien bounty hunters
who policed the conspiracy for the aliens.

41:21.879 --> 41:27.044
But they were wrong
and it led to the destruction of the conspiracy.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.675
Who destroyed it?

41:28.786 --> 41:34.782
A group of renegade aliens who had
avoided infection through self-disfigurement.

41:34.859 --> 41:39.387
And the conspirators themselves?
What happened to them?

41:39.497 --> 41:43.729
They're all dead now,
killed by the same faceless aliens.

41:45.202 --> 41:48.000
Then what are you afraid of now?

41:51.909 --> 41:55.037
Why resist testifying here today?

41:59.350 --> 42:02.911
Because the conspiracy continues,

42:03.020 --> 42:06.046
just in another form by other men.

42:06.156 --> 42:10.058
Objection. Mr Skinner can't ask questions
and give the answers.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.822
- Sustained.
- Fox Mulder's on trial for murder.

42:12.897 --> 42:17.527
The man he's accused of killing
is one of these new conspirators,

42:17.601 --> 42:22.163
what they're calling a super-soldier.
You can prove this, can't you?

42:22.239 --> 42:25.697
You know who these men are, don't you?

42:25.776 --> 42:27.903
Miss Covarrubias?

42:32.783 --> 42:35.013
They'll kill her.

42:35.085 --> 42:38.020
l asked you a question. l need an answer.

42:38.088 --> 42:39.749
No.

42:47.865 --> 42:50.356
lt's OK. Let her go.

42:50.434 --> 42:53.699
What are you doing?
She's the last best witness we have.

42:53.771 --> 42:56.934
lt doesn't matter.

43:05.816 --> 43:08.410
Thank you, Miss Covarrubias.

43:10.454 --> 43:13.446
l got nothing else.

43:29.406 --> 43:31.840
Assistant Director.

43:45.322 --> 43:49.782
l have an unscheduled witness
that l'd like to call here today.

43:49.860 --> 43:51.589
- Not him.
- Sit down.

43:51.662 --> 43:55.621
- l'm trying to protect that boy.
- Now he's here to protect you.

43:57.334 --> 44:02.135
Mr Kallenbrunner, do you have
any objections to this witness?

44:02.206 --> 44:05.539
Not like Mr Mulder here does.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.804
Can you tell us your name?

44:11.882 --> 44:13.611
Gibson Andrew Praise.

44:13.684 --> 44:17.711
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. He's my friend.

44:19.123 --> 44:23.389
- l hid him in the desert for the last year.
- Mulder met you as a chess prodigy.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.486
Your life was endangered
due to your unusual brain activity.

44:26.563 --> 44:29.532
Cut to the chase, Mr Skinner.

44:29.633 --> 44:35.230
Gibson Praise can read people's minds.
Mulder and Scully proved this scientifically.

44:35.873 --> 44:42.005
There's a certain junk DNA which all humans
share but has no apparent function.

44:42.079 --> 44:46.675
Gibson's junk DNA is functional,
DNA which is believed to be alien.

44:46.750 --> 44:50.914
- You're trying to tell us he can read minds?
- Yes.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.922
He's reading your mind right now.

44:55.426 --> 44:57.826
And the minds of the judges, too?

44:57.895 --> 44:59.692
Yes.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.269
Even his.

45:11.942 --> 45:15.571
And what makes him so special?

45:16.380 --> 45:19.178
He's not human.

45:19.249 --> 45:22.878
He's one of them. He's one of them.
l want that man examined.

45:22.953 --> 45:25.888
- Mr Skinner, control him.
- You're afraid.

45:25.956 --> 45:29.619
You're afraid of what l know.
You're afraid of the truth.

45:56.453 --> 46:00.480
- Where's Gibson?
- He's with Scully, in good hands.

46:00.591 --> 46:04.925
We talked to him. Gibson knows you're
concerned. We're protecting him now.

46:04.995 --> 46:08.089
He shouldn't have done what he did,
exposing himself.

46:08.165 --> 46:11.134
The boy was trying to protect you.
lt may have worked.

46:11.235 --> 46:15.262
He says three judges are wavering.
They're leaning in your favor.

46:15.339 --> 46:18.672
lt's gonna take more than that,
the way things are going.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.142
We were never gonna win.

46:21.245 --> 46:24.305
Take the stand, Mulder. Testify.

46:24.414 --> 46:25.346
No.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.850
- Then we'll testify, me and Monica.
- No.

46:28.952 --> 46:33.685
- Both of us have seen...
- They'll destroy you, put you on the street.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.351
What's left for us on the X-Files?

46:36.460 --> 46:41.329
We came to this job to give it our best.
lt's the way we're gonna leave.

46:41.431 --> 46:43.797
lt's not about how good you are.

46:43.867 --> 46:46.700
They control the game. They own it.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.329
Then let's shove it up their ass.

46:51.842 --> 46:54.106
Mr Skinner.

46:54.178 --> 46:57.511
l'd like to call John Doggett.

47:08.692 --> 47:12.856
Agent Doggett, you've been
on the X-Files for two years.

47:12.963 --> 47:19.664
With all that you've seen, how do you feel
about this term ''paranormal?''

47:19.736 --> 47:24.901
Calling something paranormal's
just a way of avoiding a real explanation.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.067
You're a skeptic.

47:27.177 --> 47:32.638
But l see in your case reports descriptions
of things a skeptic would never believe in.

47:32.716 --> 47:35.742
- These so-called super-soldiers.
- That's different.

47:35.853 --> 47:39.152
- ln what way?
- Cos l've seen 'em with my own eyes.

47:39.756 --> 47:45.717
Shot, drowned,
even ground up in a garbage truck.

47:45.829 --> 47:48.423
And they just come right back to life.

47:51.668 --> 47:53.829
What are they?

47:53.904 --> 47:59.342
The best l can figure, they're a secret military
project - ordinary men made invincible.

47:59.409 --> 48:03.846
Objection. What does this science fiction
have to do with anything?

48:03.914 --> 48:08.749
Doggett's going to tell you that the man
Mulder's accused of killing is a super-soldier,

48:08.852 --> 48:13.551
a man that Agent Doggett served with
in the marines, name of Knowle Rohrer.

48:13.624 --> 48:18.584
Objection. Agent Doggett was not present at
the murder, nor has he examined the victim.

48:18.695 --> 48:21.289
l been getting the bum's rush
from the government.

48:21.398 --> 48:23.457
Objection sustained.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.733
Then let me ask you, Agent Doggett,

48:29.806 --> 48:35.938
if a super-soldier is invincible, how could
Mulder possibly have killed this man?

48:36.046 --> 48:38.207
He couldn't.

48:39.449 --> 48:45.319
The way l understand it, the only way
to kill a super-soldier is with some rare metal.

48:45.422 --> 48:49.119
Scully says it's a form of magnetite
from some meteor that fell to earth.

48:49.226 --> 48:52.252
And Mulder's not accused
of doing that, is he?

48:52.329 --> 48:54.422
No, sir.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.893
Your witness.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.269
Agent Doggett,

49:06.343 --> 49:08.834
l've been going over your files.

49:08.946 --> 49:11.938
l must say, it's an honor to speak to a man

49:12.015 --> 49:15.917
whose record is distinguished
by such duty to his country.

49:15.986 --> 49:18.318
l'm not gonna doubt a man of your integrity,

49:18.422 --> 49:23.450
even if he tells me a story
l find too incredible to believe.

49:23.527 --> 49:24.459
Thank you.

49:24.528 --> 49:29.795
Just as you must not doubt the integrity of
Mulder, on whose behalf you are testifying.

49:29.866 --> 49:32.300
Correct.

49:32.369 --> 49:37.170
Even if Mulder believes
these so-called super-soldiers are aliens?

49:43.613 --> 49:46.810
He believes they're aliens, you know.

49:46.883 --> 49:49.351
- You said you were a skeptic.
- That's right.

49:49.453 --> 49:53.287
So an alien conspiracy,
which Mulder has built his defense on,

49:53.357 --> 49:56.349
must be entirely unbelievable to you, too.

50:14.077 --> 50:17.911
My name is Monica Reyes.
l've been with the FBl since 1990.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.745
Before coming on to the X-Files,

50:20.851 --> 50:24.912
you worked in New Orleans
investigating cases of satanic ritual abuse.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.046
l did.

50:26.156 --> 50:29.250
- Did you ever prosecute any of these cases?
- No.

50:29.359 --> 50:34.763
For God's sake. We're trying a man for
murder, not taking a trip down memory lane.

50:34.865 --> 50:40.326
l'm showing the court that Agent Reyes is
levelheaded and objective on strange cases.

50:40.404 --> 50:43.532
That her belief in aliens
comes from firsthand experience,

50:43.607 --> 50:47.270
and she can offer you hard proof
that there is an alien conspiracy.

50:47.377 --> 50:50.710
l was called on last year
to protect Agent Scully,

50:50.781 --> 50:53.944
whose life was in danger
because of her pregnancy.

50:54.051 --> 50:57.020
What does this have to do with aliens?

50:57.087 --> 51:02.024
l drove Agent Scully to a secluded location
in Georgia where she could deliver safely.

51:02.092 --> 51:04.560
But we soon discovered we weren't alone.

51:04.628 --> 51:08.120
l was attacked and had to defend myself
against an assailant

51:08.231 --> 51:12.725
who was shot at point-blank range,
who should have died but didn't.

51:12.803 --> 51:16.204
This assailant was then joined
by others like him,

51:16.273 --> 51:20.539
who surrounded Agent Scully and me and
witnessed her as she gave birth to her son.

51:20.610 --> 51:23.977
Witnessed her? What do you mean?

51:24.081 --> 51:26.413
We were confused as well.

51:26.483 --> 51:30.249
But we came to understand
that her son was a kind of miracle child.

51:30.320 --> 51:34.450
lts birth was all-important to them,
these so-called super-soldiers,

51:34.558 --> 51:38.255
who l believe are humans replaced by aliens.

51:38.328 --> 51:43.595
Why would Scully's child
be important to aliens, Agent Reyes?

51:43.667 --> 51:49.299
Scully was one of a number of random
women who had miraculous childbirths.

51:49.406 --> 51:54.571
They all had been abducted as part of
a program to manipulate their biology,

51:54.644 --> 51:59.604
operating offshore on a navy ship,
using these women as surrogates.

51:59.683 --> 52:02.811
- Surrogates?
- For alien babies.

52:02.919 --> 52:06.980
- To create a slave race?
- Yes.

52:07.090 --> 52:11.789
A program, conducted by the navy,
on a ship which is where?

52:11.862 --> 52:15.161
The ship was exploded on a Baltimore dock.

52:15.265 --> 52:21.465
So, in other words, we have
no true evidence past your good word?

52:25.809 --> 52:31.042
You claim Scully gave birth to one of these
alien babies. How can you be sure of this?

52:31.114 --> 52:35.676
l saw her child do things
that could be explained no other way.

52:35.752 --> 52:39.882
l saw him display amazing powers.
He'd move objects with his mind.

52:39.956 --> 52:45.053
Really? Do you think we could arrange
a demonstration for the court?

52:45.128 --> 52:50.760
No. The child was given up for adoption
to an anonymous family.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.598
She gave up the miracle child,

52:53.670 --> 53:00.234
the proof of everything that she and Mulder
claim that they've risked their lives for.

53:00.343 --> 53:04.040
- She just sent it off to some strangers?
- Yes. To protect him.

53:04.147 --> 53:07.639
Thank you, Agent Reyes. That's all.

53:10.887 --> 53:15.221
You don't care about that child
or what Scully had to sacrifice.

53:15.325 --> 53:17.850
You're happy she gave it up
so there's no proof.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.192
Agent Reyes.

53:20.263 --> 53:25.599
You don't care what these people have
sacrificed, what's been lost to their cause.

53:25.702 --> 53:28.193
You're glad it proves your point.

53:28.271 --> 53:32.002
- That's enough.
- What is the point of all of this?

53:32.075 --> 53:37.945
To destroy a man who seeks the truth
or to destroy the truth so no man can seek it?

53:38.048 --> 53:40.107
Either way, you lose.

54:19.389 --> 54:22.654
Are you ready for this?
We may have found Knowle Rohrer.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.125
- You've found him?
- His body.

54:25.228 --> 54:29.631
What are you talking about?
He can't die. He's a super-soldier.

54:29.733 --> 54:34.136
Exactly. But they're saying it's him,
the man Mulder killed.

54:34.237 --> 54:35.761
Who?

54:35.839 --> 54:40.276
Some guy on the phone at Fort Marlene who
didn't know he should give the run-around.

54:40.343 --> 54:43.835
l got him to send
the victim's corpse to Quantico.

54:43.947 --> 54:46.575
- lt's there now?
- We've got a car out front.

54:46.650 --> 54:49.175
Agent Scully.

54:51.688 --> 54:54.486
Agent Doggett can stay with him.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.032
Oh, my God.

55:13.677 --> 55:16.168
This is Knowle Rohrer?

55:17.681 --> 55:23.517
- That's what it says here.
- How could anyone tell if it wasn't?

55:23.620 --> 55:26.350
l need you to get me
Knowle Rohrer's medical records.

55:26.456 --> 55:29.948
They'd have to come from the military.
l don't know if l can.

55:30.026 --> 55:34.690
You've got to. Whatever it takes.
l need those records for Skinner.

55:34.798 --> 55:37.232
l need them for Mulder.

55:55.151 --> 55:59.315
Mr Skinner, please call your next witness.

56:05.395 --> 56:07.192
Assistant Director.

56:14.104 --> 56:16.368
- l found it.
- What?

56:16.439 --> 56:19.704
What's gonna get you off.

56:19.776 --> 56:23.940
l wanna move to dismiss, based on
new evidence that there is no victim.

56:24.047 --> 56:28.916
That the body is not Rohrer but a man who
died of a broken neck and was then burned.

56:29.018 --> 56:31.077
- Motion denied.
- You can't deny it.

56:31.187 --> 56:34.714
- You're in contempt of court.
- You're in contempt.

56:34.791 --> 56:37.089
Of evidence proving Mulder is innocent.

56:37.193 --> 56:41.425
You have no authorization to examine
the body. Have her removed.

56:41.531 --> 56:44.466
- She's got evidence. You gotta listen.
- Order.

56:44.567 --> 56:50.233
Remove the defendant from the courtroom.
This trial is adjourned.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.730
Gentlemen.

57:24.674 --> 57:26.767
We have a verdict.

57:27.577 --> 57:29.636
lf you'd rise.

57:32.482 --> 57:38.751
Acting fairly and impartially,
this panel finds the defendant

57:39.756 --> 57:44.989
guilty of first-degree murder
under aggravated circumstances.

57:47.697 --> 57:51.929
ls there anything you'd like to say
on your behalf, Mr Mulder,

57:52.001 --> 57:54.799
before we decide your sentence?

57:56.139 --> 57:58.198
Yes.

58:16.025 --> 58:23.022
l'd like to congratulate you on succeeding
where so many before you have failed.

58:23.666 --> 58:28.467
A bullet between the eyes
would have been preferable to this charade.

58:28.538 --> 58:32.998
l've learned to pretend over the past
nine years that my victories mattered,

58:33.076 --> 58:35.909
only to realize that no one was keeping score.

58:36.012 --> 58:41.006
To realize that liars do not fear the truth
if there are enough liars.

58:41.084 --> 58:47.819
That the devil is just one man with a plan,
but evil, true evil, is a collaboration of men,

58:47.891 --> 58:50.587
which is what we have here today.

58:51.427 --> 58:59.357
lf l am a guilty man, my crime
is in daring to believe that the truth will out

58:59.435 --> 59:02.563
and that no one lie can live for ever.

59:03.339 --> 59:05.830
l believe it still.

59:07.043 --> 59:11.412
Much as you try to bury it,
the truth is out there.

59:11.514 --> 59:16.042
Greater than your lies,
the truth wants to be known.

59:16.119 --> 59:18.713
You will know it.

59:18.788 --> 59:23.521
lt'll come to you, as it's come to me,

59:23.593 --> 59:26.289
faster than the speed of light.

59:33.236 --> 59:40.301
You may believe yourselves rid of
your headache now, and maybe you are.

59:42.545 --> 59:47.642
But you've only done it
by cutting off your own heads.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.418
Yeah.

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.656
l'll tell her.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.834
Who was it?

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.996
Skinner.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.871
Agent Doggett?

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.046
Death by lethal injection.

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.015
Evening. lD, please.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.990
Master Sergeant Rohrer. Go on ahead.

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:47.027
Get up.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:52.131
- Who's there?
- l'm here with Skinner. Get up.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.642
- Move it.
- What are you doing?

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.578
We're getting you outta here. Come on.

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:20.700
Guard.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.204
Where is he?

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:27.800
- Seal the building. Seal the base.
- We have an escaped prisoner.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.983
You're never gonna make it this way.

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:13.280
Come on.

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.954
Mulder.

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.657
- You've gotta move out.
- What's he doing?

01:03:55.731 --> 01:04:00.134
What l should have done from the start.
You wanna go north to Canada.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:06.403
Get to an airport. lf you're not off the
continent in 24 hours, you may never get out.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:10.343
- None of you'll be safe now.
- You let us worry about that.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.506
Good luck.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.714
Kersh told us to head north.
This road goes south.

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.547
- That's right.
- Where are you going?

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.714
To see a man about the truth.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.799
You can't hide me forever.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:09.235
We can destroy your files,
make it next to impossible to find you.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.933
You don't know these people.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.271
l'm gonna protect you, Gibson.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.037
John.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:30.457
What the hell is this?
What the hell's going on?

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.799
They can't do this. Who authorized this?

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:40.960
l'm gonna find out.

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:47.467
- Skinner.
- They've packed up the X-Files.

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:50.067
l know. lt's out of control.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:53.741
l'm trying to get to the bottom of it.
l'm trying to get to Kersh.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.584
All l can think is it's punishment
for taking Mulder's side.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.855
Unless they found out we helped him escape.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:11.832
Then they know about
the deputy director's involvement, too.

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:18.833
- l need to see the deputy director.
- And he needs to see you.

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.956
He knows.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:47.499
- Then we're all in danger here.
- No.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.666
He knows about Mulder and Scully,
where they're going.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:55.700
- You mean the border?
- That's not where they went and they know.

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:59.338
They're gonna find them and kill them.

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:04.512
Where are they, Gibson?
Mulder and Scully, where'd they go?

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.786
Hey, hotshot.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:43.183
Have the common courtesy
of doing your business downwind.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.557
Oh, boy.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:49.462
Why don't you finish draining the little lizard
and then we'll talk?

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:53.023
- We're very worried about you.
- lt's craziness. Turn around.

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:57.061
- Just hang a big U-ie and never look back.
- l can't.

01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:00.404
Why risk perfect happiness?
Why risk your lives?

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:04.469
- Because l need to know the truth.
- You already know the truth.

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:11.086
- l need to know if l can change it.
- Change it?

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:13.815
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.982
Mulder.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:20.618
What are you doing?

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:24.292
l'll be right with you, Scully.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.513
- What are they?
- Pueblos. Anasazi lndian.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:26.185
Abandoned 2,000 years ago.
Nobody knows why.

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:29.822
Yeah, Mulder, but what are we doing here?

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.559
Hello.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:05.159
My name is Fox Mulder.

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.769
Do you understand me?

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.342
Mulder, what is this?

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:25.046
l was sent a message and a key
to the government facility at Mount Weather.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:31.389
The lndian said it was from a wise man
who lived in the ruins, the keeper of the truth.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:46.041
Do you see anything at all?

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:02.482
What's the matter, Agent Mulder?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.753
You've come to see the wise man
but you look as if you've seen a ghost.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:13.825
You're no wise man.
You're a dead man, just like Krycek and X.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:16.404
Do you see a dead man, Agent Scully?

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:22.266
l hoped and prayed you were dead,
you chain-smoking son of a bitch.

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.938
You waste your time.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:27.278
Ask Mulder.

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:30.978
He knows the futility of hopes and prayers.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.179
He knows the truth now.

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:40.189
You have told her the truth, haven't you, Fox?

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:46.299
- l helped you find it.
- You didn't help me.

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:50.361
You sent me to that government facility
knowing exactly what l'd find.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:55.808
And now you refuse to speak it.
Not to Scully, not to anyone.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:12:03.775
You even refused to testify what you learned,
even though it would have saved your life.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:10.353
You damn me for my secrets,
but you're afraid to speak the truth.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.456
You call me afraid?

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:18.967
Look at you sitting here
alone in the dark like a fossil.

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:21.798
lt's the final refuge,

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:27.331
the last place to hide from
those who are insidiously taking power now.

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:29.540
Who?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.740
The aliens.

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:38.517
They fear this place, its geology.

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.420
Magnetite.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:47.052
Like that which brought down
the original UFO in Roswell.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:51.565
lndian wise men realized this
over 2,000 years ago.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:57.606
They hid here
and watched their own culture die.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.839
The original shadow government.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.311
Agent Doggett.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.611
Who the hell's that?

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.964
lt leaves me to tell you
what Mulder's afraid to, Agent Scully.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.668
- Come on, let's go.
- lt's a scary story.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.473
You wanna come sit on my lap?

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.673
You don't scare me.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:18.913
My story's scared every president
since Truman in '47.

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.950
You don't have to hear this.

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.516
l wanna hear it, Mulder.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:33.326
The Mayans were so afraid that their calendar
stopped on the exact date my story begins.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:40.534
December 22nd, the year 2012.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:46.142
The date of the final alien invasion.

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:54.045
Mulder can confirm the date.
He saw it at Mount Weather.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:03.990
Where our own secret government
will be hiding when it all comes down.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.830
You smile.

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:15.240
Feeling drunk with power.
The power to do nothing.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:19.175
My power comes from telling you.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:22.581
Seeing your powerlessness hearing it.

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:26.243
They wanted to kill you, Fox.

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:32.550
l protected you all these years,
waiting for this moment,

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:37.822
to see you broken, afraid.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.870
Now you can die.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.298
Run, Monica. Get outta here.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.925
No.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.761
Knowle Rohrer, that's far enough.

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:22.469
Shoot me, Agent Doggett, if you think
it'll make a difference this time.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.652
Agent Doggett.

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:14.522
- Mulder, get outta there.
- They know where you are.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:40.113
- Get outta here.
- Get in the car.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.452
No. Go.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.223
Go.

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:29.886
What are you thinking?

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.687
Mulder?

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.393
l'm thinking

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:48.541
l'm a guilty man.
l failed in every respect.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:52.977
l deserve the harshest punishment
for my crimes.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.413
You don't believe that.

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:10.055
l believe that l sat in a motel room
like this with you when we first met,

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:14.168
and l tried to convince you of the truth.

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:21.707
And in that respect l succeeded,
but in every other way,

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.273
l failed.

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:30.114
You don't believe that either.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:34.451
l've been chasing after monsters
with a butterfly net.

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:37.753
You heard the man.
The date's set. l can't change that.

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:40.818
You wouldn't tell me,

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:44.627
not because you were afraid or broken,

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:51.761
but because you didn't want to accept defeat.

01:21:56.244 --> 01:22:00.408
l was afraid of what knowing
would do to you.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:10.388
l was afraid that it would crush your spirit.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.460
Why would l accept defeat?

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.993
Why would l accept it if you won't?

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:33.172
Mulder, you say that you've failed,
but you only fail if you give up.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.613
And l know you.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.983
You can't give up.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:47.151
lt's what l saw in you when we first met.

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:50.095
lt's what made me follow you.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.768
Why l'd do it all over again.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.206
Look what it's gotten you.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.875
And what has it gotten you?

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.848
Not your sister.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:21.792
Nothing that you've set out for.

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:27.460
But you won't give up, even now.

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:43.847
You've always said that you wanna believe.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.513
But believe in what, Mulder?

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:59.500
lf this is the truth that you've been
looking for, then what is left to believe in?

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:09.576
l wanna believe that...
the dead are not lost to us,

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.939
that they speak to us,

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:20.511
as part of something greater than us,
greater than any alien force.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.918
And if you and l are powerless now,

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:31.890
l wanna believe that
if we listen to what's speaking,

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:36.768
it can give us the power to save ourselves.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.771
Then we believe the same thing.

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.346
Maybe there's hope.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:23.739
