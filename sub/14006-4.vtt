00:01.910 --> 00:03.940
Previously on damages

00:04.689 --> 00:07.150
My god.Ellen.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.170
- What happened?
- I didn't kill david.

00:11.850 --> 00:14.240
Someone tried to kill me.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.140
6 MONTHS EARLIER

00:17.150 --> 00:22.600
Arthur frobisher told his employees to invest
in the company and then sold his own stock.

00:22.610 --> 00:27.390
We don't have a case unless we can
connect frobisher with his broker.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.700
You're my sister.How do
you know arthur frobisher?

00:29.710 --> 00:33.580
You and I,we meet at some
boring luncheon down in florida,

00:33.590 --> 00:36.390
and the next thing you
know,we're-we're partners.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.490
Katie,this whole case turns on
one weekend,and you were there.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.550
You're stepping into the spotlight now.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.810
Details of your life
are going to come out.

00:43.820 --> 00:46.280
I think katie's lying about
the guy she met in florida.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.920
His name is gregory malina.

00:47.930 --> 00:50.570
Do you remember we actually
saw him down in florida?

00:50.580 --> 00:54.340
If you do know something,you should come
down and speak to the lawyers with me.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.780
The only time I saw
frobisher was with you.

00:56.790 --> 01:01.080
If patty hewes gets that girl in
front of a jury,all bets are off.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.930
Ten years,one box,one trip.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.319
You didn't deserve this.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.880
I miss seeing you
around the office,tommy.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.720
Everyone thinks you
were actually canned.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.030
What is it,tom?

01:12.040 --> 01:17.120
Following katie connor?I'm
a lawyer,patty.I miss it.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.130
Hey,everybody wants to know
when you're going to get here.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.520
I have no idea.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.940
The decision's yours.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.910
Ellen was still there
when i left at 9:15.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.950
Well,interesting choice.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.490
Can I just say what a bad idea this is?

02:24.980 --> 02:27.510
- Gregory.
- Katie.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.810
what the hell was that?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.100
Come on,follow me.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.870
Wait,wait,wait.How many
drinks did you have?

02:40.880 --> 02:45.050
The two,with gregory,and
then...before that maybe another beer.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.630
- And no drugs?
- No drugs.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.460
And you never caught his last name.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.440
We have been over this.It's
no like it was a formal date.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.910
I love florida!

02:56.320 --> 02:57.420
let's go to another club.Come on.

02:57.430 --> 02:59.150
Oh,I can'T.I got a
big day tomorrow--

02:59.160 --> 03:01.180
I've gotta be up early.I can'T.

03:01.190 --> 03:03.670
Who doesn't?If you don't go to
sleep,you don't have to wake up,right?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.740
oh,god.Okay!

03:10.320 --> 03:12.120
wait for me!

03:12.130 --> 03:14.230
And you didn't see
frobisher in the nightclub?

03:14.240 --> 03:17.640
No,I didn't even know what he
looked like until the parking lot.

03:17.650 --> 03:18.990
No shit.You live in brooklyn,too?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.820
It's better in the the boroughs.

03:20.830 --> 03:21.950
I live in williamburg.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.010
Isn't that crazy?You come
all the way to florida and

03:24.020 --> 03:26.420
meet someone who
lives,like,five minutes away.

03:26.430 --> 03:29.670
- What are you doing down here?
- Business.You?

03:30.030 --> 03:31.440
Oh,shit.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.400
- Friends of yours?
- I wish.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.740
That's arthur frobisher.The
guy's got more money than trump.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.380
You think that guy eats beef?

03:41.390 --> 03:43.840
I think that guy eats
small cows for breakfast.

03:45.060 --> 03:47.650
I'm catering a function
for him tomorrow.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.970
Ah,you're a cook.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.670
We prefer to say chef.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.980
I'm a waiter.I guess that
means I'm beneath you.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.760
Not yet.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.980
you want me to keep going?

04:01.740 --> 04:05.710
We still don't have enough unless you
can identify the man who got in the limo.

04:08.830 --> 04:11.410
I only saw him for,like,a split second.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.630
Is there anything you can remember?

04:13.640 --> 04:16.940
Was he tall,short?Young,old?

04:16.950 --> 04:19.450
It was five years ago.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.570
But I can tell you that he wasn't any of these
people you showed me from the government trial.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.490
And what about your one-night stand?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.300
Greg lived in
williamsburg.He was a waiter.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.290
He was staying in his friend's condo.

04:31.300 --> 04:35.340
Which we can't find because you don't
remember what part of town you were in.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.540
Why don't you try hypnosis?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.450
It helped me quit smoking.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.680
Still stuck in the parking lot?

04:42.690 --> 04:44.300
Afraid so.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.610
Well,you know what's going to happen
if we don't come up with anything?

04:49.620 --> 04:52.260
The clients are going to
accept frobisher's settlement.

04:52.270 --> 04:56.090
Unless katie turns out
to be a viable witness.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.700
What is this?

05:03.940 --> 05:05.830
A ding dong.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.790
A what?

05:08.130 --> 05:09.890
A ding dong.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.870
It's delicious.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.900
Go home.It's late.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.590
Try again tomorrow.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.390
It tastes like a ho ho.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.440
Ms.Connor,is that your brother?

05:40.150 --> 05:42.590
Y...yes!

05:45.410 --> 05:47.360
Oh,my...

05:52.110 --> 05:54.230
oh,god!

Hewes,michael.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.140
His mother.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.710
What?

06:49.340 --> 06:53.710
Why not?He's been there a week.He's
entitled to phone privileges.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.250
Listen...

07:00.260 --> 07:03.490
I've waited seven
days to talk to my son,

07:03.500 --> 07:05.870
and now you're telling me I can't?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.770
Fine.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.450
I said fine.

07:13.110 --> 07:15.670
I'll call again next week.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.130
Mr.Frobisher's case is fully staffed.

07:43.370 --> 07:46.810
We're billing roughly
$550,000 per month.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.550
- And the payments?
- Always prompt.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.840
Our client's aware of all
the exigencies one encounters

07:52.850 --> 07:55.990
when trying a case against patty hewes.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.690
Ray,what does she have that she has not
accepted mr.Frobisher's settlement offer?

08:01.700 --> 08:03.060
Nothing.

08:03.070 --> 08:07.870
Ms.Hewes has been unable to provide
even one significant witness.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.790
She's failed to produce
any evidence that

08:09.800 --> 08:12.920
mr.Frobisher breached
his duty to his employees,

08:12.930 --> 08:16.140
or participated in the
alleged fraud that she...

08:16.150 --> 08:18.820
- Ray...
- Yes,amos?

08:19.190 --> 08:22.980
You know how much mr.Frobisher's
case means to this firm.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.200
Get it done.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.120
Yes,sir.

08:33.940 --> 08:37.400
Roughly 5,200 employees
are involved in the suit.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.960
Arthur frobisher-- he wiped out
our whole retirement account.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.790
1.4 billion.Gone.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.200
So,you know,most of us,we
just lost everything we had.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.410
You have to stop torturing yourself.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.360
You're doing everything you can.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.230
Am I?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.500
Yes,katie,you are.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.520
Patty needs to know who got
in that limo with frobisher.

09:06.940 --> 09:10.770
And she keeps asking about
you-- my one-night stand.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.020
What if I can't keep this up?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.630
What if I slip,or they back
me into a corner or something?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.800
You're going to be fine.Okay?

09:24.370 --> 09:26.430
Maybe you should come in.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.290
- Why won't you just talk to them?
- And tell them what?

09:30.560 --> 09:32.840
I saw the same thing you did.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.990
Maybe you'd remember something
if you saw the pictures.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.800
Hey,if I go in there,then my wife
is going to find out about us,

09:42.810 --> 09:45.170
and then we'll be
over,and I don't want that.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.820
It's not about us.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.510
It's about frobisher and those
people whose lives he ruined.

09:51.410 --> 09:55.520
Patty is the only one holding
him responsible for this.

09:55.870 --> 09:59.330
You really think patty
hewes cares about you?

10:00.880 --> 10:03.840
Here is the complete
dossier on katie connor.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.660
Is she still seeing gregory?

10:06.670 --> 10:08.210
Almost every day.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.790
you think she knows anything?

10:12.130 --> 10:15.210
I'm not sure.Keep an eye on her.

10:15.430 --> 10:18.350
If she's going to give us something,she's
going to have to get it from him.

10:19.430 --> 10:25.360
My guy says he can get greg's stock
portfolio by the end of the week.

10:26.010 --> 10:27.140
Good.

10:27.150 --> 10:29.780
No.No,it's not good,patty.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.430
This kind of thing
could get me disbarred.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.220
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.750
Are you still on the board of the
jazz society at lincoln center?

10:42.760 --> 10:44.000
Why?

10:44.690 --> 10:46.630
Well,the head of the
trilling school is on it,too,

10:46.640 --> 10:48.970
and I was wondering if you'd
put in a word in for megan...

10:48.980 --> 10:52.330
Tom,wake up.People think I fired you.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.520
Find another connection.

11:02.390 --> 11:03.880
What is it?

11:03.890 --> 11:05.620
I guess it's a rite of passage.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.400
- What is?
- It was the icu.

11:08.740 --> 11:12.880
I assisted on my first bypass yesterday,and
the patient's not doing so hot.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.610
Oh,baby,I'm sorry.

11:15.110 --> 11:17.290
The family looks at you like you're god.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.630
If they only knew...

11:26.930 --> 11:29.780
Shit.So much for exercise.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.260
What?

11:31.270 --> 11:33.010
What are you doing tonight?

11:33.020 --> 11:34.370
I got a couple hours.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.420
- So?
- Catch a movie?

11:36.430 --> 11:38.760
I'm in.Movie,tonight.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.010
You got your saxophone,sweetheart?

11:41.020 --> 11:43.660
I'm holding it.Daddy,I'm
going to be late for assembly.

11:43.690 --> 11:46.570
Okay,okay.You look bellisima.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.680
- Bye,dad.
- Bye-bye.

11:49.110 --> 11:52.620
Good luck with the solo.********

11:54.450 --> 11:56.800
You didn't tell me she was a musician.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.590
Martin,twice in one week.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.930
We got to stop meeting like this

12:00.940 --> 12:03.210
I was hoping we could
finish monday's chat.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.950
I appreciate the offer.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.690
I've been doing some soul searching--
I'm just not ready to start work yet.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.880
Bullshit.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.220
I know what's going on
between you and patty.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.640
Excuse me?

12:20.650 --> 12:22.500
The whole world sees it.

12:22.510 --> 12:26.170
She treats you like dirt for ten
years,won't share the spotlight,

12:26.180 --> 12:29.040
then she refuses to make you a partner.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.890
You don't know what you're
talking about,martin.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.110
Sure,I don'T.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.340
You're not a battered wife defending
her abusive husband to the end,huh?

12:36.350 --> 12:37.260
Oh,geez.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.210
Yeah,that's it.No,you got it.That's me.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.800
You know,your little
girl-- she's terrific.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.940
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

12:44.950 --> 12:46.960
She serious with the music?

12:47.380 --> 12:50.540
Yeah,she's pretty
serious,considering she's ten.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.140
I ask 'cause I know that she's
got an application at trilling.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.320
How do you know that?

12:58.330 --> 13:01.140
Well,I'm president elect
of the parents' board.

13:01.150 --> 13:03.930
You guys have put together
an outstanding app.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.470
Good,good.Megan's got
her heart set on trilling.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.120
All her friends are going.

13:09.130 --> 13:11.170
Got to say,it'S...

13:11.350 --> 13:15.800
it sure is tough though to accept an applicant
whose father checks the unemployed box.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.820
Martin...

13:21.160 --> 13:23.970
- don't do this.
- Come on,take it easy,tom.

13:24.180 --> 13:27.580
There are other schools.Some
of them even pretty good.

13:27.590 --> 13:30.920
But,at trilling,we've got the
music department in the entire city.

13:30.930 --> 13:33.130
Harvard,yale,princeton--

13:34.110 --> 13:36.510
without trilling,they
don't have orchestras.

13:37.810 --> 13:40.100
I'd love to see megan get in.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.470
Comedy or drama?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.810
I'm sorry?

13:55.250 --> 13:58.390
I heard you telling that other doctor
that you were going to go see a movie.

13:59.910 --> 14:03.620
Oh,I'm sorry you overheard
my personal conversation.

14:04.370 --> 14:06.290
Oh,I shouldn't have been listening.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.750
I want you to know that we are doing everything
that we can to make your grandfather comfortable.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.530
I know.Thanks.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.060
And I really appreciate all
the time you take with him.

14:17.610 --> 14:19.610
You've been great.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.490
So...comedy or drama?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.510
Uh,I don't know.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.080
I was thinking maybe the cassavetes
retrospective at film forum.

14:32.090 --> 14:34.930
I've never heard of that.Is it funny?

14:34.940 --> 14:37.490
No.It's pretty serious.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.980
'70s stuff.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.960
I guess I'm more the drama type.

14:40.970 --> 14:44.140
Oh,not me.I love comedies.You
know,they're just so funny.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.920
Oh,oh,check it out.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.250
My grandpa got me into
these old radio shows.Here.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.770
Who is this?

14:59.780 --> 15:01.350
It's jack benny.

15:03.450 --> 15:04.760
It's good.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.870
Grandpa loves the guy,so
i downloaded it for him.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.770
That'll be nice.

15:11.130 --> 15:13.270
Yeah.Well...

15:13.480 --> 15:15.360
enjoy your big night out.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.400
Thank you.

15:17.410 --> 15:20.370
And have some popcorn for
me.'Cause I'll be here.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.820
Sure thing.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.200
Oh,and dr.Conner...

15:26.370 --> 15:28.320
be a little naughty.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.910
Excuse me?

15:30.920 --> 15:33.130
Get something chocolate.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.540
You got it.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.900
Ellen?

15:43.910 --> 15:46.660
Hey,can you come in tomorrow?I
pulled more photos to run by you.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.070
Minor players,but we
should check them out.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.410
Okay,I can try.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.920
Cool.I'll be in the office at 8:00.

15:51.930 --> 15:53.690
Look,I got to go.

15:56.230 --> 15:58.210
What are you doing here?

15:59.140 --> 16:02.340
I know who he is.The guy in the limo.

16:02.350 --> 16:04.040
With frobisher?

16:04.720 --> 16:08.270
Katie,I don't want to get
involved in any of this,okay?

16:08.280 --> 16:10.340
But you saw his face.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.930
I didn't know who he was
when we first saw him.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.230
Then I recognized him on court tv.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.980
They did this thing on frobisher's
broker during the criminal trial.

16:18.990 --> 16:20.860
And who is he?

16:21.010 --> 16:21.940
Katie...

16:21.950 --> 16:24.160
What's his name?

16:26.220 --> 16:29.020
- His name is luke richards.
- Luke richards?

16:29.030 --> 16:31.540
He was one of the broker's assistants.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.500
But ellen said all of
the assistants had alibis.

16:34.510 --> 16:37.360
Well,richards must be
lying,because I definitely saw him.

16:38.140 --> 16:42.020
Gregory,if you could have linked frobisher
to his broker,why didn't you tell me?

16:42.030 --> 16:43.530
Because I'm not going to get involved.

16:43.540 --> 16:44.790
What?Why not?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.830
I don't want to be another kato kalen.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.150
Let 15 minutes of bullshit
ruin the rest of my life.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.550
- Gregory,for jes...
- No,no.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.490
Maybe I'm an asshole,but I'm not going to
let these people use me and throw me away.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.940
Which is exactly what
they're going to do.

16:54.950 --> 16:57.370
Okay,well,forget about
them.What about me?

16:57.380 --> 17:01.410
I have risked everything I have to put
this guy away,and now you're just going...

17:01.420 --> 17:03.540
Going to be a selfish prick?Yeah.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.210
And you should,too.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.690
Think about it,katie.

17:07.700 --> 17:12.849
You're going to lose your restaurant,your
privacy,any shot at having a normal life.

17:13.579 --> 17:16.089
I do care about you.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.369
I don't want to see you get hurt.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.890
Stay out of it.

17:22.329 --> 17:25.829
Just stay out of it,okay?

17:28.580 --> 17:29.990
Katie...

17:53.340 --> 17:55.950
Darrell goldstein interned
at frobisher's company.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.170
No,not him.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.430
- Paul ordell-- he
was a temp. - No.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.950
Luke richards.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.470
Katie,what is it?

18:11.720 --> 18:14.290
Hi,there.I'm arthur.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.940
Oh,my god.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.400
Katie?

18:18.410 --> 18:20.420
You want me to be a
witness against frobisher?

18:20.430 --> 18:21.860
Yes,if you know something.

18:21.870 --> 18:25.340
She's going to be screwed.She
will lose everything,won't she?

18:32.070 --> 18:34.230
Nothing.Keep going.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.690
Stephen gilbride.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.620
No,not him.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.410
Jason raber.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.680
No,not him.

18:46.010 --> 18:50.570
You and I,we never really spoke
when we were down in florida,did we?

18:51.150 --> 18:53.070
No,no,that's right.

18:53.680 --> 18:57.180
I want the straight story,and until
you tell me,you're worthless to me.

18:57.190 --> 18:59.560
I don't give a shit about you.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.540
No,go back to that other guy.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.990
No,before him.Yeah,him.

19:10.530 --> 19:12.910
You recognize him?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.260
When was this picture taken?

19:15.270 --> 19:17.490
Last year.Why?

19:19.090 --> 19:21.970
- Yeah,he was younger,but...
- But what?

19:22.910 --> 19:25.350
It could be luke richards.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.660
I think this could be the guy.

19:31.550 --> 19:34.610
- The guy you saw get in the limo with frobisher?
- Yeah.

19:36.310 --> 19:39.990
- But a second ago you said it wasn't him.
- Because he looked familiar,and...

19:41.850 --> 19:43.970
yeah,this is definitely him.

19:43.980 --> 19:48.240
Katie,are you 100%
sure?It's okay if you're not.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.870
Our fates are intertwined,katie.

19:53.230 --> 19:55.470
Isn't that remarkable?

20:02.220 --> 20:04.080
I'm sure.

20:05.990 --> 20:08.170
Who is he,anyway?

20:09.290 --> 20:12.190
Richards was an assistant
to frobisher's broker.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.370
You're kidding.Seriously?

20:26.450 --> 20:30.300
You farted in your sleep last night.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.730
David! You're on speaker.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.560
Classic.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.700
My bad.I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.830
It's a great day,david.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.630
Oh,yeah?Why's that?

20:42.640 --> 20:44.850
I'm willing to try anything. Your
sister really came through today.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.630
We're moving forward.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.050
Oh,god.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.530
David?We're going to
prepare katie's testimony.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.750
What?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.740
She made an id.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.660
Babe,are you busy?

21:00.750 --> 21:04.290
yeah,kind of.Can
I,um...can we talk tonight?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.100
Yeah,sure.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.220
I don't think he's getting much sleep.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.510
I don't think he's getting laid.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.690
Hey,okay,too far.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.830
R-I-c-h-a-r-d-s,luke.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.660
Find out where he was
on the frobisher weekend.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.820
All right,patty,I'll look into it.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.340
martin,tom shayes.

21:43.670 --> 21:47.340
Make me an offer.I'm ready to listen.

21:49.730 --> 21:51.600
Bad news,ray.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.690
Looks like they got a witness.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.720
Such a sweet girl.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.490
I was hoping it wasn't
going to come to this.

22:09.770 --> 22:14.030
A mock deposition is just a tool to
see where you're at in your testimony.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.980
Patty's brought in roger kastle.

22:15.990 --> 22:17.530
Who's he?

22:17.540 --> 22:20.820
Big name in medical
malpractice.He's kind of a legend.

22:20.830 --> 22:22.560
Is he a sleazeball?

22:22.570 --> 22:25.410
Patty's asked him to play
the role of ray fiske.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.990
Perfect.

22:28.820 --> 22:32.520
And you're certain this is the man
you saw enter mr.Frobisher's limousine?

22:32.530 --> 22:35.330
Yes,100% certain.

22:36.330 --> 22:38.870
Okay.Good.

22:40.480 --> 22:45.220
So,ms.Connor,how would you characterize
your stay at the maxwell clinic?

22:46.490 --> 22:48.000
What do you mean?

22:48.010 --> 22:51.670
I was simply wondering if your
stint in rehab was successful.

22:52.310 --> 22:56.930
You had an extremely difficult time
overcoming your drug addiction,did you not?

22:57.300 --> 23:00.110
Eyes on me,ms.Connor.

23:02.290 --> 23:04.850
How is this relevant?

23:05.190 --> 23:08.390
Blurred vision,paranoia,auditory
hallucinations,

23:08.400 --> 23:13.980
unfortunately,are all documented long-term
side effects of serious cocaine abuse.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.700
I did one line in the parking lot.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.370
but earlier that evening,how
many lines did you do in the club?

23:20.380 --> 23:24.270
And more importantly,how much cocaine
had you consumed prior to that night?

23:24.280 --> 23:26.760
- I don't know.
- Enough not to remember?

23:26.770 --> 23:28.050
No,I didn't say that.

23:28.060 --> 23:31.570
And this mystery man who supplied you
with cocaine,what was his last name?

23:31.580 --> 23:34.920
I don't remember.I'm better with faces.

23:34.930 --> 23:38.190
- Oh,so yours is more of a visual memory?
- Yes.

23:38.470 --> 23:40.500
Was he circumcised?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.800
Was he circumcised,ms.Connor?

23:43.810 --> 23:44.960
You're kidding,right?

23:44.970 --> 23:46.430
Well,now you said you
went back to his condo.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.170
- So what?
- So I assumed you had intercourse.

23:49.710 --> 23:51.600
No.

23:52.750 --> 23:58.390
Then why six weeks later did you schedule a procedure
at hudson general to terminate your pregnancy?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.760
Jesus christ.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.910
Ms.Hewes,maybe we should take a break.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.770
I thought we had an understanding.

24:09.360 --> 24:14.940
Ms.Connor,would you characterize your life
as one big blur of narcotics and intercourse?

24:14.950 --> 24:17.330
Would you characterize
yourself as an asshole?

24:17.340 --> 24:19.690
Let the record reflect that
the witness is refusing...

24:19.700 --> 24:23.480
- Somebody shut this guy up!
- Katie,sit down.

24:26.260 --> 24:28.310
Wow,she's not ready.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.200
You signed their medical release waiver.

24:34.850 --> 24:37.060
Go on,sit down.

24:39.220 --> 24:42.270
I told you that the truth would
have to come out eventually.

24:42.950 --> 24:48.740
I also warned you that the spotlight
is a pretty goddamn awful place to be.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.920
And mr.Kastle's right,you're
not ready for it.

24:51.930 --> 24:54.940
Because this deposition
isn't about the facts.

24:55.190 --> 24:59.410
It's about katie connor and do
we like her and is she credible.

24:59.830 --> 25:03.380
Yes,you saw this man in florida,but
it's your word against theirs.

25:03.390 --> 25:07.330
And if ray fiske can
embarrass you,piss you off,

25:07.340 --> 25:10.840
rattle you in any way,it's over.

25:10.850 --> 25:13.030
He's done what
he's set out to do--

25:13.040 --> 25:16.910
neutralize your testimony
and weaken our case.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.190
Katie,why don't we go
outside for a moment?

25:24.010 --> 25:26.360
No,I want to keep going.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.300
Good.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.470
Try again.

25:37.660 --> 25:41.180
Oh,my god.Can I talk to her?

25:41.700 --> 25:44.230
Not until her attorney gets back.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.860
You really think she killed my brother?

25:52.450 --> 25:55.240
They were due to get
married in two weeks.

25:55.760 --> 25:59.810
Katie,you didn't know they
called off their engagement?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.000
No.No.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.210
We had a falling out,we
haven't spoken in months.

26:13.410 --> 26:15.600
Katie,why didn't you tell me?

26:16.190 --> 26:20.090
What,that I got pregnant
and ended up in rehab?

26:20.430 --> 26:22.410
Isn't it obvious?

26:23.440 --> 26:27.770
I wanted to forget it ever
happened and then...this case.

26:29.590 --> 26:31.650
What about gregory?

26:32.600 --> 26:34.420
He never even knew you were...

26:34.430 --> 26:37.280
No,I never had a chance
to tell him the truth.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.560
The whole truth,and nothing
but the truth,so help you god?

26:44.570 --> 26:46.240
I do.

26:47.580 --> 26:51.870
Ms.Connor,thank you
for joining us today.

26:52.500 --> 26:56.900
And many thanks to the plaintiff's
attorney for the use of her conference room.

26:56.910 --> 27:00.750
Now,as for the subject
of today's deposition,

27:00.760 --> 27:03.900
I've been instructed by the court

27:03.910 --> 27:08.460
to limit my questions to the
18th and the 19th of june,2002.

27:08.470 --> 27:12.530
Those dates ring a
bell for you,ms.Connor?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.410
Yes,sir.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.800
I was in palm beach,working for
a catering company at that time.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.340
We were doing a business
event for arthur frobisher.

27:22.390 --> 27:26.010
Ms.Connor,do you recognize
the man in this photo?

27:27.650 --> 27:30.020
Yes,that's arthur frobisher.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.450
And the man in this photo?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.450
Luke richards.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.140
Luke richards.Thank you,ms.Connor.

27:38.150 --> 27:42.650
Let the record reflect that the witness
has correctly identified both men.

27:45.910 --> 27:50.360
Now,ms.Connor,if you permit
me to cut to the chase...

27:52.090 --> 27:58.220
you claim that you saw these men together
early morning on june 19,do you not?

27:58.950 --> 28:01.360
Yes,I did.

28:01.650 --> 28:06.410
And where did this alleged
sighting take place?

28:06.720 --> 28:10.510
In a parking lot on the
200 block of ocean avenue.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.580
Mr.Frobisher was in a limousine and
mr.Richards got into that limousine.

28:16.060 --> 28:19.520
And where were you when this happened?

28:19.920 --> 28:22.470
I was in that same parking lot.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.100
Alone?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.770
No,sir.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.860
With whom were you in this parking lot?

28:34.020 --> 28:37.110
With a man I met in a
club earlier that evening.

28:41.360 --> 28:46.510
If these next few questions
make you blush,ms.Connor,

28:47.020 --> 28:50.010
- I apologize.
- To screw.

28:52.810 --> 28:54.530
I'm sorry?

28:55.090 --> 28:58.580
That's why I was in an empty parking
lot in the middle of the night.

28:59.290 --> 29:02.490
And later on a couch
and then on the floor.

29:03.080 --> 29:06.530
Do you find cocaine is like viagra?

29:06.540 --> 29:11.120
Or are you more of a tantric
breathing kind of a guy,like sting?

29:11.800 --> 29:17.070
If these past few answers make
you blush,mr.Fiske,i apologize.

29:26.100 --> 29:29.640
So you saw mr.Richards get
into a limo when it was parked,

29:29.650 --> 29:32.810
what,25,30 yards away?

29:32.820 --> 29:35.900
I got my best look at
his face as he left.

29:35.910 --> 29:38.210
He turned his face toward the window.

29:38.220 --> 29:42.350
I couldn't have been more
than ten feet away at the time.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.120
And this was when exactly?

29:46.700 --> 29:49.950
Between 1:15 and 1:45 A.M.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.890
You checked your watch.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.580
Gunshots forced us to leave the club.

29:57.590 --> 30:02.680
It's my understanding that the police report
documents this at approximately 1:15 A.M.

30:02.690 --> 30:06.720
So,you saw mr.Frobisher with mr.Richards

30:06.730 --> 30:12.970
some time after 1:15
A.M.Saturday morning june 19,2002.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.000
I remind you,you're
under oath,ms.Connor.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.500
Yes,that's when i saw them.

30:23.310 --> 30:27.640
Would you agree that a man
can't be in two places at once?

30:27.650 --> 30:30.510
Objection to form.Vague
and ambiguous argument.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.700
Noted.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.480
Go ahead,katie,you can answer.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.740
Yeah,I'd agree.A man cannot
be in two places at once.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.940
So,when mr.Richards told investigators
he was at the jersey shore

30:47.950 --> 30:51.540
with a college buddy pulling
cod out of the atlantic,

30:51.550 --> 30:54.550
it's your contention he was lying.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.420
Yes,sir.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.380
Mine,too.

31:02.390 --> 31:05.250
Let's not get cute here,counsel.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.590
Ms.Connor,can you identify
the man in exhibit 15?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.230
Objection.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.700
This exhibit was not made
available to us during discovery.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.490
We've only just
discovered this ourselves.

31:20.500 --> 31:25.010
We have every intention of producing it to
ms.Hewes at the close of this deposition.

31:25.020 --> 31:26.390
Noted.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.810
You can answer.

31:33.930 --> 31:37.430
The man in the picture,ms.Connor.

31:39.870 --> 31:41.950
Luke richards.

31:42.550 --> 31:46.130
Luke richards.And the text there...

31:46.960 --> 31:49.280
what does that say?

31:55.250 --> 31:57.600
Out loud,ms.Connor.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.300
But this isn't true.

32:01.910 --> 32:06.800
Ms.Connor,I'm not asking for an opinion,I'm
asking you to read.Now what does it say?

32:14.350 --> 32:18.040
June 19,2002,

32:18.300 --> 32:20.490
1:37 A.M.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.990
Let the record reflect that exhibit 15

32:23.000 --> 32:25.340
shows mr.Richards withdrawing cash

32:25.350 --> 32:31.560
from an atm located at 333 casino east
boulevard,which is where,ms.Connor?

32:31.570 --> 32:34.580
I'm telling you luke richards
was in that parking lot.

32:34.810 --> 32:38.390
Can you read the last
four words,ms.Connor?

32:38.400 --> 32:42.800
- I am not lying,he was there.
- The last four words.

32:45.870 --> 32:50.810
Atlantic city,new jersey.But I swear
to god,he was in that parking lot.

32:52.590 --> 32:56.210
Luke richards did lie,ms.Connor,but

32:56.220 --> 32:59.280
I suspect it had
everything to do with that

32:59.290 --> 33:05.080
woman standing next to him with
the muscular arms and adam's apple.

33:06.510 --> 33:10.330
He wasn't hiding arthur frobisher's
transgressions,he was hiding his own.

33:13.070 --> 33:15.640
Why are you lying?

33:16.220 --> 33:18.750
Objection.Argumentative.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.780
This is bullshit!

33:25.390 --> 33:27.750
I think we're finished here.

33:33.410 --> 33:35.100
You hear that,patty?

33:37.100 --> 33:41.660
That's the sound of the zeroes dropping
off of mr.Frobisher's revised offer.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.940
I heard everything went well.

34:11.270 --> 34:13.770
The threat's gone.She lied under oath.

34:15.639 --> 34:19.420
I want you to know,we ruined her life.

34:19.530 --> 34:22.739
If you kept your dick in your
pants,we wouldn't have had to.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.850
It's been five years.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.230
Starting today,I want you guys to
leave me alone.Just let me live my life.

34:29.270 --> 34:31.360
I don't think that's going to happen.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.090
I don't even think she remembers you.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.230
Did I ask what you think?

34:50.199 --> 34:51.170
Let's go to another club.Come on.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.020
Oh,I can't! I got a big day tomorrow!

34:53.030 --> 34:54.570
- I can't!
- Who doesn't?

34:54.580 --> 34:57.180
If you don't go to sleep,you
don't have to wake up,right?Right?

34:59.400 --> 35:02.030
okay! Wait for me!

35:05.540 --> 35:09.660
Five years from now,what
is katie connor doing?

35:12.350 --> 35:17.910
I'd like my own little restaurant in
brooklyn,but that is not going to happen.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.190
Why not?

35:20.470 --> 35:23.260
Because I have got the biggest
gig in my life tomorrow,

35:23.270 --> 35:28.760
and I've got to be at work in five
hours,and I am,like,totally wired.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.470
Relax.Hey,hey,relax.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.320
Here,try one of these.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.750
You'll be out in ten minutes.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.970
I'm going to hit the shower.

35:47.370 --> 35:50.590
- Okay...
- Only the white ones,okay?

36:35.050 --> 36:36.750
You were right,you know?

36:37.930 --> 36:40.390
Gregory turns out to
be our missing link.

36:45.330 --> 36:48.380
Gregory malina owned frobisher stock?

36:48.390 --> 36:50.270
Guess when he cashed out.

36:53.660 --> 36:56.140
June,2002.

36:56.890 --> 36:59.340
Katie connor never knew what hit her.

37:00.930 --> 37:03.550
But you had the photo before anyone,

37:03.560 --> 37:07.680
so why would you let her be deposed if
you knew she wouldn't hold up as a witness?

37:08.180 --> 37:11.380
Because now ray fiske thinks
we don't have anything.

37:11.390 --> 37:16.060
And watch,his next step will
be to pull the settlement offer.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.920
Which is what you wanted all along.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.030
Why?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.990
Why would you do this to me?Why?

37:32.330 --> 37:33.900
Katie,katie,come here.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.380
Don't touch me.

37:35.390 --> 37:38.010
You lied to me,asshole!

37:38.020 --> 37:39.990
- Greg,are you cool?
- Yeah,yeah,we're fine.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.580
You lied to me! Why did you lie to me?

37:43.600 --> 37:46.060
Answer my question!

37:46.260 --> 37:48.860
- Why don't you just call me later,okay?
- Yeah,I'll call you later.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.790
I'll call your wife later.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.030
Dude,you're married now?

37:57.190 --> 37:58.770
Katie...

37:59.130 --> 38:02.150
Why would you do this to me,gregory?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.150
I'm sorry.

38:06.770 --> 38:08.960
Go to hell.

38:10.770 --> 38:12.780
Katie.

38:14.490 --> 38:17.320
- This is your solution?
- Katie,what about the restaurant?

38:17.330 --> 38:19.760
You can't just run away from this.

38:19.770 --> 38:22.380
I know.I tried.You wouldn't let me.

38:22.390 --> 38:25.210
What?This is my fault?

38:25.480 --> 38:28.230
I only tried to help your case.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.320
Katie,you perjured yourself.

38:30.330 --> 38:31.610
People go to jail for that.

38:31.620 --> 38:35.820
There was an answer you wanted,and
you hounded me until you got it.

38:35.830 --> 38:37.330
That is bullshit.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.460
You know,you are not mad that I lied.

38:39.470 --> 38:42.950
You are just pissed that I got
caught and made you look bad.

38:43.830 --> 38:46.450
I only ever wanted the truth.

38:46.460 --> 38:50.530
No,ellen,all you ever wanted
was to impress patty hewes.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.450
Katie?Katie!

38:57.350 --> 39:00.830
From day one,I never
wanted her involved in this!

39:20.150 --> 39:22.650
I'm so sorry,miss hewes.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.250
I thought I knew her.I trusted her.

39:27.690 --> 39:30.810
Katie's a very good liar,ellen.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.810
She had me fooled,too.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.200
You're a lawyer,lies
come with the territory.

39:39.590 --> 39:42.600
Will the clients
accept a settlement now?

39:43.010 --> 39:47.370
I assume so,which is too bad

39:47.380 --> 39:49.690
because I think we could
have gotten them more,

39:49.700 --> 39:53.680
but frobisher's in
the driver's seat now.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.650
It just doesn't make any
sense.Fiske had pictures.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.940
He was right there waiting
with richard's alibi.

39:59.950 --> 40:04.250
Ray fiske is a brilliant lawyer
who made us look very foolish today.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.640
It happens.

40:08.930 --> 40:12.710
Ellen,I understand

40:12.720 --> 40:15.730
how it must
hurt right now--

40:16.330 --> 40:18.340
what happened
with katie--

40:19.250 --> 40:20.920
but...

40:21.660 --> 40:26.050
there's a very important lesson
to be learned from all this.

40:26.910 --> 40:28.970
Which is?

40:31.020 --> 40:34.700
Trust no one.

41:03.570 --> 41:06.690
Listen, I don't want to be presumptuous.

41:06.700 --> 41:11.270
I'm not available.I'm engaged.

41:11.980 --> 41:15.230
We can play this any way you like.

41:43.430 --> 41:46.110
I don't even think she remembers you.
