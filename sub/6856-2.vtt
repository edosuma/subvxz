Belief is not a matter of choice,
but of conviction.

00:17.605 --> 00:19.724
<i>The clone starfleet is under seige.</i>

00:19.894 --> 00:21.972
<i>Dozens of Republic warships have
been destroyed in</i>

00:22.142 --> 00:25.349
<i>merciless surprise attacks that leave
no survivors.</i>

00:25.519 --> 00:27.939
<i>Rumors spread of a terrible new
Separatist weapon.</i>

00:28.266 --> 00:29.851
<i>In the face of growing fear,</i>

00:30.021 --> 00:32.098
<i>The Jedi Council sends
Master Plo Koon</i>

00:32.268 --> 00:33.918
<i>to hunt down the menace</i>

00:34.088 --> 00:36.163
<i>before it strikes again.</i>

00:47.268 --> 00:49.414
The enemy ship has reduced its speed
General.

00:49.584 --> 00:52.005
They must have realized we're
tracking them.

00:56.466 --> 00:58.597
We're tracking 3 Republic cruisers.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.429
What should we do?

01:00.773 --> 01:02.682
Jam their transmissions.

01:04.611 --> 01:06.534
The fleet is holding its position sire.

01:06.704 --> 01:10.520
I think it wise to report our position
before we attack.

01:11.904 --> 01:14.351
Skywalkers' fleet is nearby,
in the Bith system.

01:14.521 --> 01:17.160
Good. Perhaps he can reinforce us.

01:17.330 --> 01:20.660
From what I hear, Skywalker's always
ready for a fight.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.833
So I've heard.

01:24.728 --> 01:26.289
<i>Koh-to-ya, Master Plo.</i>

01:26.633 --> 01:28.291
Koh-to-ya, little Soka.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.460
<i>How's the hunt for the mystery
weapon going?</i>

01:30.721 --> 01:32.726
We've tracked it to the Abregado system.

01:32.896 --> 01:34.505
We need reinforcements.

01:34.850 --> 01:36.785
<i>I'll have to ask the Council
Master Plo.</i>

01:36.955 --> 01:40.094
<i>I was given strict orders to protect
our staging area.</i>

01:41.485 --> 01:43.139
<i>Master Plo, what's happening...</i>

01:43.399 --> 01:45.245
What is wrong with the transmission?

01:45.415 --> 01:47.894
There's too much interference sir.
We've lost 'em.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.849
You heard Master Plo,

01:50.019 --> 01:52.662
He needs our support.
We have to go help him.

01:52.832 --> 01:55.162
We have to see what the Council decides
first.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.103
This is an important meeting, Ahsoka.

01:57.273 --> 02:00.406
Remember, be mindful,
and speak only when spoken to.

02:01.828 --> 02:04.302
<i>This mystery weapon has struck
in a dozen systems,</i>

02:04.472 --> 02:06.349
<i>and disappeared without a trace.</i>

02:06.519 --> 02:10.275
<i>We cannot afford to lose anymore
ships my friends.</i>

02:10.768 --> 02:12.149
<i>Master Skywalker.</i>

02:12.319 --> 02:15.981
<i>Have you had any success in finding
General Grievous' secret weapon?</i>

02:17.667 --> 02:20.592
Master Plo was here in the Abregado system
when we lost contact.

02:23.908 --> 02:26.808
- The enemy ship is closing.
- Prepare for battle.

02:30.530 --> 02:31.634
General Grievous,

02:31.804 --> 02:34.784
this will be a suitable test
for our new weapon.

02:35.259 --> 02:37.109
You may fire when ready.

02:37.454 --> 02:38.611
Yes my lord.

02:42.084 --> 02:44.283
We're picking up a large energy
reading from the target sir.

02:44.544 --> 02:47.036
- Open fire.
- We're not in range yet sir.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.408
Fire!

02:55.472 --> 02:56.754
Brace for impact!

02:58.892 --> 03:00.858
We're losing all our power.

03:01.728 --> 03:04.678
That energy field has left us
defenceless.

03:05.023 --> 03:08.893
- Their shields are down.
- All cannons, fire.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.772
Their tearing us apart one by one.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.619
Quickly, into the pods.

03:33.218 --> 03:36.468
We don't have much time,
get inside, hurry!

03:45.252 --> 03:48.930
Another successful test,
wouldn't you say Count?

03:49.276 --> 03:51.486
We must keep our position secret.

03:51.656 --> 03:53.292
Send out the hunters.

03:53.462 --> 03:56.938
I want all of those lifepods destroyed.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.399
We've had no further contact with
General Plo Koon.

04:04.569 --> 04:07.033
The absence of distress beacons
indicates that his fleet was...

04:08.587 --> 04:10.870
that his fleet was destroyed,
like the others.

04:11.131 --> 04:12.857
We are about to prepare a rescue mission.

04:13.027 --> 04:15.499
<i>Hasn't clone intelligence reported</i>

04:15.760 --> 04:17.233
<i>this weapon never leaves any survivors?</i>

04:17.404 --> 04:19.666
<i>The Separatists are being unusually
tidy.</i>

04:19.837 --> 04:21.755
<i>They don't want any witnesses.</i>

04:22.309 --> 04:25.103
<i>Tragic are these losses,
but prevent more,</i>

04:25.273 --> 04:26.412
<i>we must.</i>

04:30.024 --> 04:31.481
The power grid is burned out.

04:31.651 --> 04:34.001
We've no engines,
communications or...

04:34.446 --> 04:35.946
life support recharge.

04:36.364 --> 04:38.820
So, we'll just sit here,
and hold our breath.

04:39.073 --> 04:40.983
Someone will come looking for us,
right?

04:42.662 --> 04:46.410
Let's get the power restored,
so we are here to be found.

04:53.256 --> 04:56.481
<i>All our battle groups will be
reassigned to guard our supply convoys.</i>

04:56.651 --> 04:58.459
<i>Including yours Skywalker.</i>

04:58.720 --> 05:01.796
<i>I'm afraid we can't risk any more
ships with a rescue mission.</i>

05:02.057 --> 05:03.030
Wait!

05:03.516 --> 05:05.945
Just because there haven't been any
survivors before,

05:06.115 --> 05:08.594
doesn't mean there won't be any this time.

05:10.023 --> 05:12.072
<i>Boldly spoken for one so young.</i>

05:12.567 --> 05:14.188
<i>She is learning from Anakin.</i>

05:14.569 --> 05:16.055
Excuse my padawan.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.603
We will deploy, as you've
instructed, Master.

05:21.652 --> 05:22.652
Ahsoka!

05:23.077 --> 05:25.697
If anyone could survive,
Master Plo could.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.175
- I don't understand why....
- What you don't understand,

05:28.345 --> 05:31.517
is Jedi protocol, or your place,
my young padawan.

05:31.687 --> 05:32.534
Admiral.

05:32.879 --> 05:35.367
We'll split up our ships to
maximize our defense area.

05:35.537 --> 05:36.982
I'll scout ahead for enemy activity.

05:37.152 --> 05:39.874
Isn't that risky, with the
mystery weapon out there?

05:40.220 --> 05:43.294
It might be, but I know you won't
argue my orders.

05:44.531 --> 05:45.731
Come on Snips.

05:51.404 --> 05:53.515
The air in here's getting a bit stale.

05:54.108 --> 05:55.232
Don't look at me,

05:55.402 --> 05:58.672
it's Boost sir. He only takes a bath
when he's on leave.

05:58.842 --> 06:01.689
Save it. Just keep working on the pod,
not your jokes.

06:02.006 --> 06:04.024
Do you think we've got a chance General?

06:04.285 --> 06:06.317
I don't believe in chance Commander.

06:06.663 --> 06:09.232
I know if we work together we will
stay alive,

06:09.402 --> 06:11.694
and someone will find us.

06:12.210 --> 06:15.115
With all due respect General,

06:15.831 --> 06:19.274
strategically it doesn't make any
sense for someone to come look for us.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.292
If I was in command, I'd be huntin'
that weapon down.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.586
I value your life,

06:24.756 --> 06:27.171
- more than finding that weapon.
- Sir.

06:27.609 --> 06:29.424
There's another pod out there.

06:31.896 --> 06:34.276
If we only had power we could
contact them.

06:34.446 --> 06:37.688
How 'bout we just wave hello
when the viewport comes around..

06:44.283 --> 06:47.562
They're dead.
Someone busted that pod wide open.

06:50.565 --> 06:52.878
We are not alone out here.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.876
Set those new coordinates R2?

07:02.046 --> 07:04.792
Master, I should tell you why I spoke
up before...

07:05.138 --> 07:07.045
You don't have to explain anything.

07:23.984 --> 07:27.170
R2, set up the scanner,
modulate for incoming,

07:27.340 --> 07:28.859
"mystery" weapons.

07:30.246 --> 07:31.406
No, R2,

07:31.576 --> 07:34.114
tune the scanners for life forms.
highest sensitivity.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.900
Why would we scan for life forms

07:36.070 --> 07:39.036
to spot an enemy weapon probably
just filled with,

07:39.297 --> 07:40.889
battle...droids?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.914
The Abregado system.

07:44.677 --> 07:47.293
So it's okay when you don't follow
what the council says!

07:47.638 --> 07:50.035
Doing what the Jedi Council says,
that's one thing,

07:50.205 --> 07:52.553
how we go about doing it,
that's another.

07:52.904 --> 07:55.225
That's what I'm trying to teach you
my young padawan.

07:55.395 --> 07:57.804
So you always meant to come out
here for survivors?

07:58.065 --> 08:01.424
Lives are in danger Asohka,
we can't just turn our backs on them.

08:01.594 --> 08:03.301
That's what I said back in the
briefing room!

08:03.471 --> 08:06.187
I know,
but the way you said it was wrong.

08:07.306 --> 08:09.191
Hurry up, switch on the illuminator.

08:09.452 --> 08:11.985
We haven't got much time before the
fleet misses us.

08:14.957 --> 08:16.380
No, that's not it.

08:16.550 --> 08:19.190
This one goes there,
that one goes there.

08:19.544 --> 08:22.172
Are you sure?
We don't want to make things worse.

08:22.342 --> 08:24.608
How, are we gonna make things worse?

08:25.966 --> 08:27.609
When you ask for trouble,

08:27.779 --> 08:31.213
you should not be surprised when
it finds you.

08:31.906 --> 08:34.296
I think trouble already found us sir.

08:34.894 --> 08:37.301
What if we connect these two wires,
right here?

08:40.941 --> 08:42.394
I'm getting something.

08:42.859 --> 08:46.123
<i>pod 197...we're under attack.
Is anyone out there?</i>

08:46.293 --> 08:47.771
It's one of our other pods.

08:48.831 --> 08:50.482
<i>I repeat, we are under attack.</i>

08:51.967 --> 08:53.317
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

08:53.662 --> 08:56.707
That signal is weak, they must be
close by.

09:00.877 --> 09:03.447
<i>They've locked onto our ship!</i>

09:03.798 --> 09:05.080
Go get 'em boys!

09:08.761 --> 09:10.877
<i>Our position is mark 12,
at point 26.</i>

09:11.377 --> 09:14.296
- Let's cut this can open.
- I have visual contact.

09:19.855 --> 09:22.374
Pod 1977, do you copy?

09:22.900 --> 09:25.809
<i>The droids are hunting for survivors.
They're cutting through!</i>

09:31.688 --> 09:32.721
There they go.

09:33.298 --> 09:35.768
Things, just got a lot worse.

09:42.294 --> 09:46.161
The scanners are practically useless.
Got anything on the emergency channel R2?

09:47.674 --> 09:50.791
Now Ahsoka, we might find something
you don't want to find.

09:51.136 --> 09:53.752
I know Master,
but I have to believe.

09:54.098 --> 09:55.797
How do you know Master Plo anyway?

09:56.058 --> 09:59.619
He's one of my oldest friends.
It was Master Plo Koon who found me,

09:59.789 --> 10:01.864
and brought me to the temple
where I belonged.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.548
Now he's lost, so I thought,
maybe I could find him.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.186
Incoming transmission Master.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.742
<i>Anakin, where are you?</i>

10:13.855 --> 10:17.193
Hello Master. Uh, we made a quick
stop in the Abregado system.

10:17.538 --> 10:20.739
<i>- You have other orders.
- It was my idea Master Obi-Wan.</i>

10:21.083 --> 10:22.173
<i>Oh I'm sure.</i>

10:22.343 --> 10:25.793
<i>- Well, have you found any survivors?
- No, you were right.</i>

10:26.218 --> 10:28.384
The Separatists don't want any witnesses.

10:28.554 --> 10:31.944
<i>All the more reason for you to rejoin
the defensive escorts.</i>

10:32.114 --> 10:33.501
<i>We need you, Anakin.</i>

10:33.846 --> 10:36.799
<i>You're going to miss the rendezvous with
the fleet if you don't hurry.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:38.828
I know Master. We're on our way.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.176
I'm sorry Ahsoka.

10:49.570 --> 10:50.956
What is it R2?

10:51.636 --> 10:54.174
R2 thinks he's got something on the
emergency channel.

10:54.344 --> 10:55.594
Can he trace it?

10:55.973 --> 10:56.998
Let's get going.

10:59.496 --> 11:01.154
I think they see us.

11:02.032 --> 11:04.582
Corporal, there's another pod
over there.

11:19.717 --> 11:21.018
It is time to go.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.010
Go? Where are you going sir?

11:24.659 --> 11:26.741
Outside to destroy the enemy.

11:26.911 --> 11:29.140
I can withstand the pressure
for a brief time.

11:29.533 --> 11:30.892
Put your helmets on.

11:31.152 --> 11:32.864
If you say so sir.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.777
Wolf, keep the communications
signal alive.

11:43.346 --> 11:45.996
It is our only chance someone
will find us.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.867
Let's just hope someone's looking for us.

11:55.063 --> 11:57.039
Are we still picking up that signal?

11:57.428 --> 11:59.927
Yes, but why aren't we finding anybody?

12:00.319 --> 12:02.522
I don't know Ahsoka, I don't know.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.885
Well, this looks like the last one.

12:06.424 --> 12:07.887
Let's finish the job.

12:19.242 --> 12:20.274
Is there anyone out there?

12:20.534 --> 12:23.194
This is Ahsoka Tano.
Can anyone here me?

12:28.376 --> 12:30.660
Time to put the squeeze on them.

12:36.703 --> 12:39.020
<i>Is there anyone out there? Come in.</i>

12:39.190 --> 12:41.295
<i>- This is Ahsoka Tano.
- It's Ahsoka.</i>

12:41.555 --> 12:44.673
- She must be close.
- Keep the signal alive, commander.

12:44.934 --> 12:47.302
R2, see if you can boost the reception.

12:50.898 --> 12:53.683
Patience. We're trying to boost the power.
Hang on.

13:05.955 --> 13:08.489
We're losing the signal.
The pod can't take much more damage.

13:08.749 --> 13:11.367
- Sinker, your turn.
- I'm on it boss.

13:13.855 --> 13:15.082
What the...

13:15.816 --> 13:17.456
Eat lazer clankers.

13:35.025 --> 13:37.726
Sir, we've lost contact with the pod hunter.

13:37.987 --> 13:40.947
Perhaps some survivors are putting up
a fight.

13:41.396 --> 13:43.676
That is something we cannot allow.

13:48.038 --> 13:51.323
<i>We must find a way to destroy this
mystery weapon.</i>

13:52.149 --> 13:55.777
<i>In this war, a step ahead of us,
Dooku always seems.</i>

13:57.006 --> 13:59.162
Tell me, has there been any word

13:59.332 --> 14:01.655
from Master Plo Koon or his fleet?

14:02.636 --> 14:04.592
<i>No, we must fear the worst.</i>

14:04.762 --> 14:06.921
<i>Actually, I just received word</i>

14:07.266 --> 14:09.800
<i>that Anakin has found the remains of
Master Plo's fleet</i>

14:09.970 --> 14:12.178
<i>and is searching the debris for survivors.</i>

14:13.027 --> 14:15.723
On whose authority has he done this?

14:16.067 --> 14:17.227
<i>His own, I'm afraid.</i>

14:17.397 --> 14:20.019
<i>With his fleet out of position,
we are left vulnerable.</i>

14:20.279 --> 14:22.041
<i>Oh his fleet is right where it should be,</i>

14:22.211 --> 14:25.491
<i>He's taken only a small ship,
and his padawan.</i>

14:26.773 --> 14:29.139
<i>Twice the trouble, they have become.</i>

14:29.928 --> 14:32.823
<i>A wreckless decision,
Skywalker has made.</i>

14:33.083 --> 14:35.904
Let us hope it is not a costly one.

14:37.589 --> 14:38.746
Well, General,

14:39.006 --> 14:41.498
another fine mess we've gotten into.

14:41.758 --> 14:44.000
Your sense of humor is improving.

14:44.261 --> 14:46.086
I don't mean to say I told you so,

14:46.586 --> 14:49.465
but I never believed anyone would come
looking for us.

14:54.229 --> 14:56.376
<i>Anakin, the Council is furious.</i>

14:56.709 --> 14:58.807
<i>Why, have you left your post?</i>

14:59.068 --> 15:02.144
I decided we couldn't just give up
on Master Plo Koon.

15:02.405 --> 15:03.789
<i>A noble gesture, Anakin.</i>

15:03.959 --> 15:08.233
<i>But the Council feels your daring
may put others in danger.</i>

15:09.149 --> 15:11.236
<i>Please, listen to me Anakin.</i>

15:11.497 --> 15:13.044
<i>Return at once.</i>

15:13.214 --> 15:14.538
Yes, Exellency.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.522
Time to go Ahsoka.

15:29.265 --> 15:30.506
We have to stay.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.387
Ahsoka, I want to believe Master Plo is
alive but....

15:33.557 --> 15:35.203
I know he's alive!

15:35.480 --> 15:36.887
I can sense it.

15:44.163 --> 15:45.163
Seargent,

15:45.490 --> 15:48.482
why are you so certain no one
is coming?

15:48.893 --> 15:52.569
We're just clones sir. We're meant
to be expendible.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.079
Not to me.

15:59.754 --> 16:01.954
- There they are!
- Ready tow cable...

16:06.148 --> 16:07.543
Cable loaded Master.

16:23.509 --> 16:24.559
Come on, hurry!

16:25.762 --> 16:27.684
Are you okay Master Plo?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.976
There's someone in the pod.

16:37.659 --> 16:38.991
Will they be alright?

16:39.252 --> 16:41.076
The pressure suits offer some protection,

16:41.337 --> 16:43.662
but they require a medical frigate for
recovery.

16:43.991 --> 16:45.581
I will stabilize them sir.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.653
Your men are safe now.

16:48.636 --> 16:51.712
Tell me, were there any survivors?

16:52.056 --> 16:54.131
We couldn't find anybody else.

16:54.633 --> 16:57.618
The hunters must have destroyed the rest.

16:58.279 --> 17:00.440
I'm sorry, Master Plo.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.267
We tracked the mystery weapon to
this system,

17:05.758 --> 17:08.854
that is when we found out it was
an ion cannon.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.230
An ion cannon?

17:10.491 --> 17:13.673
A weapon that neutralizes all
power to our ships,

17:14.018 --> 17:16.239
leaving the targets defenseless.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.579
There's a massive vessel approaching.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.282
Shut down the power systems before
they detect us.

17:29.193 --> 17:30.193
The droid!

17:33.359 --> 17:34.744
Sorry little guy.

17:43.524 --> 17:46.122
That is one big, cruiser crusher.

17:57.038 --> 17:59.362
There's still no signal from the pod hunter.

17:59.532 --> 18:02.115
Reduce speed and activate your scanners.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.850
We will find who is responsible.

18:11.469 --> 18:14.294
- Hey, what's with the lights?
- Power is gone out.

18:14.737 --> 18:17.631
Maybe that ship has returned.
We should get up to the bridge.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.175
You're too weak.

18:20.436 --> 18:22.177
Let me go see what is wrong.

18:35.951 --> 18:38.495
We're picking up a faint signal from a droid,

18:38.665 --> 18:41.529
it's not one of ours.
They're right behind us.

18:42.908 --> 18:44.893
Move us into attack position.

18:49.473 --> 18:50.966
They're coming back.

18:51.383 --> 18:53.473
Are all the systems shut down?

18:54.136 --> 18:55.543
Is there a problem sir?

18:55.804 --> 18:58.421
We forgot to shut off the medical droid.

18:58.682 --> 19:00.340
We've got to get the power back on now.

19:00.601 --> 19:02.578
- May I be of assistance?
- No thanks.

19:02.748 --> 19:04.636
Just get in the back and take care of the clones.

19:04.897 --> 19:06.524
That is my programming, sir.

19:06.694 --> 19:08.473
- Come on, we've gotta get out of here.
- I know! I know!

19:13.294 --> 19:16.856
Sir, the enemy is attempting to flee
through the debris field.

19:17.201 --> 19:20.193
General, I don't want any witnesses.

19:20.537 --> 19:22.487
Energize plasma rotors.

19:26.377 --> 19:29.536
R2, program the navicomputer. Be
ready to get us out of here.

19:29.797 --> 19:31.329
You forgot, we turned him off!

19:34.009 --> 19:35.458
'Cotooya' droid.

19:36.929 --> 19:38.920
Target range almost locked sir.

19:39.264 --> 19:41.494
They're not going to make it.

19:41.934 --> 19:43.716
R2, program the hyperdrive.

19:45.521 --> 19:46.678
Anywhere, hurry!

19:46.939 --> 19:48.763
Enemy ship targeted General.

19:49.024 --> 19:49.848
Fire!

20:12.008 --> 20:12.954
Master?

20:28.639 --> 20:29.689
We're clear.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.565
Now the Republic will learn of our
ion cannon.

20:49.042 --> 20:51.753
Your failure is most unfortunate.

20:52.264 --> 20:53.953
I will have to discuss this,

20:54.298 --> 20:55.612
with my Master.

20:59.126 --> 21:00.793
- Get back to work!
- Roger roger.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.307
Thanks for getting us out of there
in one piece General Skywalker.

21:14.651 --> 21:16.059
You have my padawan to thank for that.

21:16.494 --> 21:18.741
She always said you guys would
pull through.

21:19.072 --> 21:21.470
General Plo said someone would come for us,

21:21.640 --> 21:23.066
we're glad he was right.

21:23.327 --> 21:26.110
Skywalker, it is time to give our report

21:26.455 --> 21:27.445
to the Council.

21:27.706 --> 21:30.003
Right, the Council report...

21:32.330 --> 21:33.493
Come on, Ahsoka.

21:33.952 --> 21:35.283
You want me there?

21:35.453 --> 21:39.123
- I figured because of before...
- Asohka, through it all you never gave up,

21:39.468 --> 21:42.668
You did a great job.
But, if I'm getting in trouble for this,

21:43.348 --> 21:45.062
you're gonna share some of the blame too.

21:46.349 --> 21:47.654
so come on, let's go.

21:48.584 --> 21:50.370
Right beside you, Master.
