My wife and my daughter
were killed

55:50.919 --> 55:52.886
in a car accident.

55:54.256 --> 55:56.157
Eight years ago.

56:09.437 --> 56:11.906
I'm so sorry, Miguel.

56:11.940 --> 56:14.142
(softly):
Yeah, me, too.

56:15.343 --> 56:17.912
It doesn't change anything.

56:19.948 --> 56:22.317
Want to tell me
about your family?

56:26.187 --> 56:28.256
I had a family once.

56:53.615 --> 56:56.518
You should bring Kaya next time.

56:56.551 --> 56:58.053
I'd love to meet her.

56:58.086 --> 57:00.989
Mm, I didn't think you...

57:01.589 --> 57:04.459
She's your niece.

57:04.492 --> 57:06.995
I'd be honored.

57:09.431 --> 57:12.400
You ever get lonely out here?

57:12.434 --> 57:14.502
Sometimes.

57:14.536 --> 57:17.372
I know I'd be more lonely
there than here.

57:18.473 --> 57:19.941
That may sound...

57:19.974 --> 57:21.343
It doesn't make
any sense, but...

57:21.376 --> 57:24.245
No, it does.

57:24.279 --> 57:26.448
It does to me.

57:32.120 --> 57:36.991
If you don't want
to talk about the past,

57:37.025 --> 57:42.364
have you thought about what
you want your life to be now?

57:42.397 --> 57:44.466
Moving forward?

57:47.268 --> 57:49.637
I just...

57:49.671 --> 57:53.108
I want to notice... more.

57:53.141 --> 57:56.544
Notice everything
around me more.

57:57.445 --> 58:00.515
Know more about here,
be able to survive here,

58:00.548 --> 58:02.317
appreciate it.

58:05.019 --> 58:07.422
- Sounds like a goal.
- Yep.

58:07.455 --> 58:10.525
You are able to live here now.

58:10.558 --> 58:12.494
(laughs)

58:12.527 --> 58:13.995
Mm.

58:14.028 --> 58:16.164
Yeah, no more cell phones,
no more traffic,

58:16.197 --> 58:19.601
no more holiday celebrations.

58:19.634 --> 58:21.202
What?

58:22.670 --> 58:25.473
Did you google me?

58:25.507 --> 58:27.275
No.

58:27.308 --> 58:30.145
I don't know
your last name, Edee.

58:30.178 --> 58:31.946

Y-You've never told me,

be interested in doing that.
