Mm-hmm.

I get to see it in action.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.058
Like... over there?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.102
- Over there--
- With actual people?

19:45.102 --> 19:46.353
With the actual people, man.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.273
How you doin'? Look, here.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.358
Alright, don't turn around,
there's a dude--

19:51.900 --> 19:53.944
Don't turn around. In the black--

19:53.944 --> 19:55.404
- You see him in the black beanie?
- Yeah. No, I saw him.

19:55.404 --> 19:58.782
Okay. He looks like
he needs an ass whooping.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.992
Absolutely not.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.787
Hey, I will get you that card
if you go over there and whoop his ass.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.046
How you gonna play it, Finn?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.423
Shh. Grandpa, I need to focus.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.050
How about the one
with the spooky earrings?

20:18.343 --> 20:19.219
No, no, no.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.929
Maybe the one with the,
the one with the double heads.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.306
- God, Grandpa!
- Okay.

we lost.

Juju Bubble is the worst card
you could’ve played right there.

20:43.869 --> 20:44.786
What now?

20:45.245 --> 20:47.915
Finn, why’d you play the Juju Boob, man?

20:47.915 --> 20:49.041
We were gonna lose anyway,

20:49.041 --> 20:51.585
