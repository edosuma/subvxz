00:01.210 --> 00:03.712
MALE NARRATOR 1:
<i>Good night, triangle. Good night, square.</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:05.297
<i>- Thanks for showing us</i>

00:05.297 --> 00:07.132
<i>how fun it is to learn!</i>

00:07.216 --> 00:08.217
Do you want me to get

00:08.217 --> 00:10.135
their pajamas or should I?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.348
MALE NARRATOR 2: <i>Next,</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.975
Blood Orgy Seven:
Rise of the Organ Hoarder.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.277
Oh, my God!

00:27.361 --> 00:28.403
<i>Why?</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:29.571
Why?

00:43.001 --> 00:47.005
- Are you Daniel Boone?
- Who's asking?

00:47.089 --> 00:48.799
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:48.799 --> 00:52.594
I just came to see Kentucky,
the fifth-largest tobacco producer

00:52.678 --> 00:54.638
and the third-largest coal producer

00:54.638 --> 00:56.306
in the country.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.475
I feel like I am there.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.686
The only thing more
painful than children's theater

01:00.686 --> 01:02.521
is what's going on with my back right now.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.107
Why can't you take the pills
that the doctor gave you,

01:05.107 --> 01:07.317
so that you can enjoy
your son's tour de force?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.652
I just need a little stretch.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.821
Doctors give you pills
for everything today.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.239
Now we need a volunteer.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.907
Mr. Pritchett, thank you
for your enthusiasm.

01:13.991 --> 01:14.992
What?

01:14.992 --> 01:17.077
One of our players
has been kidnapped by his stepfather,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.161
but the show must go on.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.164
Place a star on the flag every time
a territory becomes a state.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.585
- Seriously? But did the police...
- How about a round of applause?

01:27.379 --> 01:29.756
Faster, please.
We're losing them.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.092
Where are you?
You're missing Joe's tribute

01:32.176 --> 01:34.344
to the 50 Nifty United States.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.931
<i>I'm at home in bed with the worst cold.</i>

01:38.015 --> 01:39.349
Afraid the whole family's down.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.227
Might have even lost
a few houseplants, yeah.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.188
Okay, I'm gonna go get some rest now.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.898
All right, take care.

01:51.153 --> 01:55.240
Phil! You told me you sold your dad's RV!

01:55.324 --> 01:57.618
And you told me you were running
your five-mile loop.

01:58.368 --> 02:02.414
This street is on your three-mile course,
so who are you really mad at, Claire?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.959
Gloria, we are so sorry,
but we're not gonna be able

02:06.043 --> 02:07.294
to make it to Joe's play.

02:07.753 --> 02:11.590
No, no, Ronaldo's mom, well,
she had emergency surgery,

02:11.590 --> 02:13.091
and, uh, he and Pepper

02:13.175 --> 02:17.804
dropped off their Great Danes to our place
with no warning.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.015
No! No! Stay away from that! Not the vase!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.101
Sorry, Gloria. I got to go.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.437
You couldn't just say you had a cold?

02:25.521 --> 02:29.191
Oh, yeah, and Abe Lincoln,
he could have said, "87 years ago."

02:29.191 --> 02:31.568
And Hamlet could have said,
"Maybe I'll kill myself." No.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.614
It's the finishing touches that separate
the merely good from great, Mitchell.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.741
Sweetie, I know
you're really tense about...

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
No, no, no! Don't jinx it! Don't jinx it!

02:39.493 --> 02:41.078
Cam is up for head coach

02:41.078 --> 02:42.746
at the University of...

02:45.666 --> 02:50.170
Cam is up for head football coach at
the University of North Central Missouri.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.463
It's his dream job,

02:51.547 --> 02:53.590
and they're supposed
to call him about it today.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.592
And it's making him a little crazy.

02:55.676 --> 03:00.013
In fact, Claire's always Dad's favorite,
and I'm really miffed about that.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.849
Oh, boy. This again, huh?

03:03.058 --> 03:04.560
Okay. No, go on.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.478
I'm ready.
- Oh, my God.

03:06.562 --> 03:09.231
- Honey, you look gorgeous. Look at her.
- Oh, sweetie. Oh...

03:09.231 --> 03:11.692
Now, may I give you a piece
of advice from my first date?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.068
Don't say how much you want to have kids,

03:13.068 --> 03:14.987
and don't cry
because your makeup will run.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.906
I'm more worried about my date
running when he sees you two there.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.741
You'll barely even notice us, okay?

03:19.825 --> 03:22.035
Just be yourself. You're so funny.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.246
Okay, tell that funny story

03:24.246 --> 03:26.248
of the old drunk guy
who was kissing the donkey.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.709
Oh, because your family's perfect?

03:28.709 --> 03:32.379
Okay. Oh, my God! That's it!
That's the job! Where's my phone?

03:32.379 --> 03:35.215
Where's my phone? This is the worst thing
that could be happening.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.925
Okay, it's just my meditation app.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.639
Okay, you need to control your man.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.809
If he gets bad news tonight
and melts down in front of Randy,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.854
- I can kiss "kissing him goodbye" goodbye.
- Okay. No, I got you.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.397
I got you. Come on, let's go.

03:50.397 --> 03:54.109
I understand. We all get attached
to things that belonged to our parents.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.613
That's not it. I'm doing this so you
and I can have some adventures.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.448
Can't you see yourself
making lists and folding shirts

03:59.448 --> 04:01.325
while we drive across
the Golden Gate Bridge?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.410
We're never gonna use this thing.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.787
It guzzles gas,
and then it takes an hour to park.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.998
Well, then leave it here.
You've always wanted a guest house.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.626
Not one with seat belts
at the dining table.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.463
No discussion, Dylan.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.340
We're taking them to see
a baby psychiatrist.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.425
Are you still talking about
that crazy movie?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.052
Well, it messed them up.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.888
We took them to the park.
Swing set? Bored.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.389
Cute squirrels? Snore.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.601
Then an old lady walking her poodle trips
and gets dragged through a rose bush,

04:27.601 --> 04:30.521
and these two burst out laughing
like two stoners in a tickle fight.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.398
I'm sure you're both overreacting the way
all new parents do.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.942
No, Mom, we're screwing this up.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.153
At the very least we need help,
like an au pair or something.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.404
That's two nannies, right?

04:39.530 --> 04:40.531
- Correct.
- Okay.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.782
Oh...

04:41.782 --> 04:45.702
Look at how gentle they're being
with that butterfly.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.663
See? You two were worrying for...

04:47.663 --> 04:49.665
They're tearing it apart.
Oh, God!

04:49.665 --> 04:52.084
What do you say
we leave the babies with Farrah,

04:52.084 --> 04:54.419
and the grown-ups go out
and talk about this over dinner?

04:54.503 --> 04:59.091
Great idea. Oh! Four people, though.
Try fitting that in a regular car.

04:59.091 --> 05:03.303
Wait a minute. What if we took
the... Are you kidding me?

05:04.012 --> 05:06.306
Remind me to buy some wheel blocks.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.436
Oh, God. Lily needs my help.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.274
What the hell are you doing?

05:15.274 --> 05:16.984
I'm trying to get her to tell
that funny donkey story.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.527
By making an Eeyore sound?

05:18.527 --> 05:20.571
You know what?
Not all donkeys are depressed.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.615
That's an offensive stereotype
perpetuated by a bunch

05:23.699 --> 05:25.033
of ignorant Iowans.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.243
Oh, my God! My phone's buzzing!

05:26.493 --> 05:27.786
Oh, it's just Longinus.

05:27.870 --> 05:31.790
Yeah, we know. You met Marie Osmond
at a Five Guys. Nobody cares.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
Stop.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.376
My friend said
we should try the potato.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.502
Hey, guys.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.129
- Lily.
- Guys, guys, guys.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.213
Hey.
Hi.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.423
Hey, guys, what are you doing here?

05:39.423 --> 05:41.175
Oh, just taking a break
from scarring our children.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.802
Now, come on. Haley and Dylan
were having a little bit of a meltdown,

05:43.886 --> 05:46.763
and we thought we'd hit Spuds
one last time before they closed for good.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.223
I know. It's sad, isn't it?

05:48.307 --> 05:50.350
Remember, we used to spend
all of our birthdays here,

05:50.434 --> 05:53.437
- and Spuddy Holly would always sing to us.
- Yes. Oh...

05:53.437 --> 05:55.856
<i>Scalloped, fried or lyonnaise</i>

05:55.856 --> 05:57.816
<i>Spuds' potatoes amaze</i>

05:57.900 --> 05:58.942
<i>Happy birthday</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:00.777
I want to stress that I'm adopted.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.654
Why don't we leave
the lovebirds to their date?

06:02.738 --> 06:03.906
Good idea, but you know what?

06:03.906 --> 06:06.575
Spuds is better with more
people, much like a vehicle.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.493
Let's see if they can sit
the rest of us together.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.953
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right.

06:15.334 --> 06:19.588
I'd been following Cam's competitor
for the coaching spot on Instagram,

06:19.588 --> 06:21.715
and he beat Cam out for the job,

06:21.715 --> 06:25.093
which meant any minute Cam would be
getting the devastating news himself,

06:25.177 --> 06:28.096
and I couldn't rely on
the joyful environment of Spuds

06:28.180 --> 06:29.473
to cushion the blow.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.893
Although, it is famously where Larry King
broke up with four of his wives.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.605
Cam, Cam, um, I just got some bad news,

06:36.605 --> 06:38.398
and I think it's best
that you hear it from me.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.026
Oh, I heard. They're out
of the Impossible Potato.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.110
You know, I'm sorry.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.988
You advertise the first potato
made entirely of meat,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.199
you better have enough for everyone.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.871
Please, just take those pills.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.207
You're more crooked
than General James Wilkinson

06:55.207 --> 06:57.000
during the Louisiana Purchase.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.921
We're down to the last state.
It's actually better if I move.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.093
Wow. This is gorgeous.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.804
- What do you call this place again?
- Pearl Harbor.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.356
Save the flag, boys!

07:28.740 --> 07:31.660
Haley, get off your phone.
The babies are fine with Dylan's mom.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.162
If you're feeling tense,
my dad's old footbath is in the RV.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.706
It plugs right into the cigarette lighter.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.291
Honey, there could be a money volcano

07:37.291 --> 07:39.376
that plugs right into
a white wine fountain in there.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.502
I still wouldn't want it.

07:40.586 --> 07:41.962
I keep remembering things
I forgot to tell her.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.505
My kids are already sociopaths.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.716
I don't need to give them
a strawberry allergy on top of it.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.385
Oh, I completely, totally get that.
Just gonna turn this off.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.305
You know what? Hey, let's all
turn off our phones. Come on.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.348
Yeah. No, come on. Live in the moment.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.559
I mean, appreciate the fact
that we live in a town

07:55.559 --> 07:58.729
with family and friends,
all sitting at the same table

07:58.729 --> 08:01.857
where Eisenhower
planned the D-Day invasion.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.150
That's probably not true.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.861
Sounds like somebody's nervous
about a possible move to Missouri.

08:06.195 --> 08:09.656
No, I'm just pointing out that there
are a lot of really great things here.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.035
Like, wouldn't it be a shame to cut
that blossoming relationship short?

08:13.035 --> 08:15.829
Actually, I'm not so sure how much
I trust that Randy guy.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.123
I mean, what kind of sicko
is attracted to a 12-year-old?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.958
I wonder if his parents
messed him up, too.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.335
You know, I read on a mommy blog

08:21.335 --> 08:24.755
that bad parenting is a direct link
to future criminality and deejaying.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.632
Okay, you know what?
You two need to be careful.

08:26.632 --> 08:30.844
'Cause you can read so much about
how to parent, you miss out on being one.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.471
Mitchell struggled with that.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.724
- Just relax.
- Oh, sweetheart.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.100
Oh.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.186
- Did you put hairspray in this?
- Just a little bit, yeah.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.021
- I'm gonna put some music on.
- No, Cam. I have to go to work.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.105
Dance with her.
Come on.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.232
I don't have time for this.
Put a little boogie in it.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.566
Oh, come on.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.195
- Just dance. You know you love this song.
- All right. Okay.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.531
Who's a dancing queen, huh?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.994
Put a little boogie in it. See? Fun.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.121
Oh, my... Was that her head?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.290
Sorry. I forgot how that story ended.

09:00.374 --> 09:04.753
It ended with us in the ER of one
of the best hospitals in the world.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.463
Nice having that only a mile away.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.590
I'll have you know that
the life expectancy in Missouri

09:08.674 --> 09:10.634
just climbed above Arkansas and Guam.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.761
Okay, give me back my phone.
I'm ordering baby helmets.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.556
Stop worrying.
Kids get bonked all the time.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.684
Do you know how many
tumbles Luke took?

09:19.852 --> 09:22.855
I think he wants to go out.
Good boy.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.065
Smart dog.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.234
I hate to break it to you,
but I think all dogs can do that.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.986
I'm gonna play outside.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.572
Ow!

09:33.198 --> 09:34.491
What happened?

09:34.575 --> 09:37.119
And he's fine. Ish.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.955
I love the guy, but we're aiming
a little bit higher than Luke.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.499
Haley, you kind of want your kids
to get knocked around a little.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.918
It toughens them up for things
that we all go through in adulthood.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.797
Daddy wins! Do you believe in miracles?

09:49.173 --> 09:52.759
USA! US... Oh, no!
Oh, geez!

09:54.803 --> 09:55.888
Oh, my... What was that?

09:55.888 --> 09:57.139
Was that a person that...
I'm good!

09:57.139 --> 09:58.265
Phil.
- Dad!

09:58.265 --> 09:59.600
Hey, Dad. Think fast.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.187
You're being a little...

10:06.481 --> 10:08.358
This isn't an emergency...

10:11.820 --> 10:14.573
Now it is.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.909
I mean, sure, I can no longer
taste salt, but...

10:16.909 --> 10:18.994
I know that they're going
to get bumps and bruises,

10:18.994 --> 10:21.663
but I'm talking about psychological scars.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.332
I've had some experience with that myself.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.834
Surprise!

10:25.918 --> 10:28.754
No! No!
No!

10:28.754 --> 10:31.757
- I'm sorry. Oh, my God.
- Nothing's happening.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.301
It still haunts her. Not to be weird,

10:34.301 --> 10:37.137
but she still won't let me mention
your names while we're making love.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.305
Oh, God.

10:38.305 --> 10:43.101
- Well, well, well.
- Yes. Well, well, well.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.562
I see your cold is better.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.065
It turns out it was like an allergy thing.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.192
And Pepper's Great Danes?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.944
Oh, uh, well, you know, they're big dogs,

10:51.944 --> 10:56.698
um, and they don't, uh, live long,
so they're dead.

10:56.782 --> 11:00.702
I must look like Frederick Seward
during the Alaska Purchase,

11:00.786 --> 11:03.747
because, apparently,
you think that I'll buy anything.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.999
Gloria, okay, okay. We're sorry.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.669
We're sorry we lied to you,
but if it makes you feel any better,

11:08.669 --> 11:12.089
Longinus took this really great photo
of you at the Shakira concert

11:12.089 --> 11:14.675
the night that you missed Lily's
clarinet recital because of pink eye.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.760
- Oh...
- Oh.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.180
I see that you've been waiting
to spring that attack on me,

11:20.264 --> 11:23.350
just like Andrew Jackson
in the Battle of New Orleans.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.978
Is this my life now?
I'm gonna use the restroom.

11:25.978 --> 11:28.230
Would someone order
the tableside baked potatoes?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.691
I mean, that's half of why
you come here, for the show.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.360
Public restroom, huh?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.611
Mmm.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.446
Shame he can't go
in the privacy of his own car.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.199
It's true, the RV does have a bathroom.

11:39.283 --> 11:42.744
And a bolted-down Mr. Coffee.
Bear-proof undercarriage food bins.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.830
And how many miles would you say is on it?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.039
Wait.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.460
You're selling her on Craigslist? And this
isn't even a good picture.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.004
This is her bad side.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.047
Hey, look, I get the value
of an RV, Claire.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.676
There is so much natural beauty
to explore here in California.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.052
The Golden State. Wait.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.305
Are you really trying to get out
of moving to Missouri?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.389
No, no.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.143
Sounds like what we need
is a Missouri Compromise.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.770
Gloria, are you drugging
Grandpa's potato-tini?

12:08.854 --> 12:11.023
You saw how bent over he is.

12:11.023 --> 12:15.194
For some reason, he's scared of pills,
and I can't watch him suffer anymore.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.155
I hate it when they get cute
with the bathroom signs.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.366
Why would french fries mean "ladies,"
and baked potato "gents"?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.535
Just throw one of them into a skirt.

12:23.619 --> 12:27.873
So, uh, Dad, Gloria says that
you won't take pills for your back?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.416
I gotta get this from all sides now?

12:30.167 --> 12:32.252
I don't like what
they do to me, all right?

12:32.336 --> 12:33.754
They make me feel super...

12:34.630 --> 12:36.173
Horny? Constipated?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.217
Emotional. You know,

12:38.217 --> 12:40.594
sometimes, you can just
ride out a pause, buddy.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.222
Anyway, the pain got so bad, I broke down.

12:43.222 --> 12:47.184
I took a couple in the men's room,
which is the maximum dose, so strap in.

12:47.643 --> 12:48.685
No, no, no.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.313
You know, I'm gonna miss this place.

12:52.523 --> 12:53.690
Look. Spuddy Holly!

12:54.483 --> 12:56.276
He just about said it all, didn't he?

12:56.360 --> 13:00.364
Scalloped, fried, lyonnaise,
Spuds' potatoes do amaze.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.911
- Four pills? Is he gonna be okay?
- He can handle it.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.038
Dad lived through the closet
scene in the '80s.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.957
- So did I.
- Oh, my God.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.750
He's talking to Lily and Dylan.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.127
I'm Dylan.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.713
You know, Randy,
you remind me of a young me,

13:17.047 --> 13:20.634
prowling Saigon with a Vietnamese beauty.
There was this one bar...

13:20.634 --> 13:22.845
Let's go. Let's get you some black coffee.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.975
- Peekaboo. George. Poppy.
- Hello. Is anybody home?

13:29.768 --> 13:32.104
What gives?
Mr. Napkin usually kills.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.647
- Who wanted coffee?
- Ah, here.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.735
- They're laughing. See? They're psychos.
- Ay.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.779
Sorry, mister. Are you okay?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.907
I actually don't feel anything,
which is even more scary.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.868
Don't be scared to feel, buddy.

13:46.076 --> 13:50.122
You could end up running away from
an emotional situation with your kids,

13:50.122 --> 13:53.041
and those are always the most rewarding.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.418
You ask me, you're lucky.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.546
She dumped me by text
while making out with her old boyfriend.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.258
I broke down crying.
My charcoal ran like mascara.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.220
I had to be comforted by the
other team's mascot. Lucky?

14:05.596 --> 14:06.889
Oh, I'm not gonna lie to you.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.726
It sucks, and sometimes,
it's gotta suck for a while.

14:11.310 --> 14:15.189
I just wish I could say some magic words,
or give you a hug, make it all go away...

14:18.609 --> 14:20.652
In a way, he raised me.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.113
Pull yourself together, man.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.615
Haley, um,

14:25.073 --> 14:29.328
I think what your chemically-humanized
grandfather is trying to say

14:29.328 --> 14:31.079
is that kids are built to last.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.664
Sure, they go through stuff,

14:32.748 --> 14:35.000
but they survive, especially
when you're around to help.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.461
I miss him.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.254
Yeah.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.007
He was your first real boyfriend.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.510
I keep expecting him to show up.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.013
He used to come by at night,
and I'd sneak out to see him.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.724
- Yeah, I know.
- You knew?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.894
His car's 30 years old
and doesn't have a muffler.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.522
And he honked.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.525
I loved that car.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.360
I know it hurts now, sweetheart,

15:02.903 --> 15:05.447
but that's how you know
it was a relationship worth having.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.412
Aw.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.582
Well, what happened? Did he come back?

15:15.958 --> 15:16.959
Uh...

15:17.709 --> 15:19.044
That was you, buddy.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.715
I love this kid. I remember
when he was a baby.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.343
We met my senior year of high school.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.970
Who does everyone think I am?

15:28.387 --> 15:31.265
You know, the thing about babies,

15:31.515 --> 15:33.058
you fall in love with a baby,

15:33.058 --> 15:35.185
with the cutest little fat folds,

15:35.269 --> 15:37.271
and then, bam, they're gone.

15:37.271 --> 15:41.859
But it's okay because in its
place, there's this toddler

15:41.859 --> 15:44.194
with the greatest laugh on earth.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.196
And then one day, the toddler's gone,

15:46.280 --> 15:47.364
and in its place

15:47.489 --> 15:52.369
a little kid that asks the most
interesting questions you've ever heard.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.162
And this keeps going on like that.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.748
But you never get the chance
to miss any of them

15:56.832 --> 15:59.585
'cause there's always a new kid
to take the place of the old.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.921
Until they grow up, and then,

16:04.256 --> 16:07.676
in a moment, all those kids
you fell in love with

16:08.886 --> 16:10.679
walk out the door at the same time.

16:11.763 --> 16:12.848
Jesus.

16:12.848 --> 16:16.143
Oh, I don't mean to be a bummer.
I'm just saying, it goes fast.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.936
Like the expression,

16:18.896 --> 16:21.523
"You never know the last time
you pick up your kid."

16:21.857 --> 16:23.317
The point we're making, Haley,

16:23.317 --> 16:25.736
is that it's natural
to worry over your kids.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.237
It just means that you love them.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.199
So I'm always gonna feel like
I screwed them up somehow?

16:30.616 --> 16:33.452
Kind of. I mean, eventually,
you'll be able to laugh at it.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.830
Probably around the time that
you're reassuring your own children

16:36.914 --> 16:38.665
that they didn't screw up their babies.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.877
- Thanks.
- No, actually, thank you.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.004
It's nice to know, as parents,

16:44.004 --> 16:45.631
that we can still have...
Dad!

16:46.006 --> 16:47.883
I miss picking up my little girl.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.968
And it won't be the last time, damn it.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.720
You want a piggyback ride, honey?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.846
- No. No. No.
- You sure?

16:52.930 --> 16:54.264
- Okay, I'm calling it.
- I'm sure.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.475
Oh, my gosh. Okay, this is it!

16:56.475 --> 16:58.018
Uh... Hello.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.813
The french fries were...

17:01.897 --> 17:03.023
Sorry about that.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.025
Took a minute getting Jay to his car. Hmm.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.402
He saw a cloud that looked like
his old football coach,

17:07.486 --> 17:09.488
- and he didn't want to be alone.
- Oh.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.448
Turned out to be kind of a fun night, huh?

17:11.532 --> 17:12.991
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:13.825 --> 17:18.455
By the way, I got a response
to my Craigslist ad.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.457
Oh. That was fast.

17:20.541 --> 17:25.754
Yeah. Yeah, really nice couple.
Soon to be empty nesters, three kids,

17:26.004 --> 17:29.633
two new grandkids,
wife's a little high-strung,

17:29.633 --> 17:33.136
husband's a bit of an oddball
with an infectious lust for life.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.013
They sound like weirdos. No sale.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.183
Phil, I'm talking about us.
We should keep the RV.

17:38.267 --> 17:41.979
That is amazing. What changed your mind?

17:42.479 --> 17:45.232
I think it was hearing
all those stories tonight.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.276
And the kids will be gone soon.

17:47.276 --> 17:49.152
We'll probably spend
a lot of time on the road.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.780
Might as well do it
in the height of luxury,

17:52.364 --> 17:55.742
with a carpeted bathroom
and a four-in-one game table.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.160
- You're incredible.
- Mmm.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.371
What did I do
to deserve a wife cool enough

17:59.371 --> 18:02.291
to let me keep my dad's RV
and his newborn parrot?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.168
- His newborn what?
- Mmm...

18:05.878 --> 18:07.754
- Honey, parrots live, like, 70 to...
- Mmm...

18:14.261 --> 18:16.096
That was not the call I was expecting.

18:16.430 --> 18:20.559
Sweetie, I know. I saw the other
coach celebrating on Instagram,

18:20.893 --> 18:22.561
drenching himself in Gatorade.

18:22.561 --> 18:25.189
In the house. There was a rug.
Who's gonna clean that up?

18:25.189 --> 18:26.732
Not him, I bet.

18:26.732 --> 18:29.067
I'm reading from your face that
you didn't know until I just told you.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.444
Now I'm just talking out of nerves.

18:30.444 --> 18:33.447
Damn it. I didn't get it?

18:33.947 --> 18:37.492
I mean, I know I'm hard to read,
but I really wanted that job.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.536
I'm so sorry. Come here.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.998
Wait. Is that why you were selling
California all night long to me,

18:42.998 --> 18:44.875
because you wanted to soften the blow
when I heard?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.794
That is weirdly sweet.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.004
I'll be there in a second.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.383
Just wanted to let you know,
the donkey story killed.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.135
It totally broke the ice.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.720
We've been having so much fun.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.097
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy.
- Thanks. Me, too.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.059
He asked if I could go outside
and get ice cream. Can I?

19:02.059 --> 19:05.771
Of course, yes, but just make good choices
about the toppings.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.898
Don't get sprinkles. They're just wax.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.778
Well, there's a small victory,
at least, right?

19:12.778 --> 19:15.864
First date was a success,
and we get an assist.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.617
- Sorry, football term.
- Except it isn't.

19:18.951 --> 19:20.786
By the way, what was
that phone call you got?

19:20.786 --> 19:21.954
Oh, uh...

19:21.954 --> 19:23.038
Crazy.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.083
- Our adoption agency.
- From years ago?

19:26.208 --> 19:29.795
Yeah, apparently, uh,
they were migrating the database,

19:29.795 --> 19:33.006
and somehow our profile
got accidently reactivated,

19:33.507 --> 19:35.133
and somebody picked us.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.637
Wait. Picked us? As in there's a baby?

19:38.762 --> 19:41.849
- I know. Wild, right?
- Well, you told them no?

19:41.849 --> 19:44.309
Well, it felt wrong
until I talked to you about it,

19:44.393 --> 19:47.062
but, yeah, I will. I'll tell them.

19:49.106 --> 19:51.233
It was really fun
telling those stories tonight.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.027
Yeah. Really puts
losing a job in perspective.

19:54.111 --> 19:57.030
You know, none of our best memories
have anything to do with work.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.033
They all have to do with
that little girl right out there.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.870
Well, you know,
she's not so little anymore.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.162
Oh.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.373
Oh, I think we're about to have
a hand-holding moment.

20:11.086 --> 20:13.630
You know, we got pretty good at this
parenting thing, didn't we?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.342
Um...

20:17.426 --> 20:20.012
So, uh, we have
to tell the agency tonight?

20:22.097 --> 20:26.518
Well, technically,
we have 24 hours to, uh, decide.

20:26.727 --> 20:27.728
Okay.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.031
Jay, I'm sorry.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.033
I will never drug you again,

20:41.033 --> 20:43.785
but it was so nice to see you
so open and honest.

20:43.869 --> 20:47.039
- Yeah, I was a regular Honest Abe.
- Who's that?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.834
It's probably good to be
emotional every now and then.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.379
I should probably practice
letting it out without a pill.

20:55.005 --> 20:58.509
Hey, I was proud of you in that
show you did. I love you.

20:58.509 --> 21:01.220
I know. We had this conversation
four times last night.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.804
- Really?
- Eh...

21:02.888 --> 21:05.265
Maybe you should check your call history.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.435
Oh, no.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.854
<i>You inspire me.</i>

21:11.605 --> 21:14.983
<i>And I think I'm rude to you sometimes
because I'm scared of that, Phil.</i>

21:15.275 --> 21:16.401
<i>This is a long way of saying</i>

21:16.485 --> 21:18.320
<i>I think I finally
have a best friend.</i>

21:20.197 --> 21:21.365
<i>You inspire me.</i>

21:22.032 --> 21:23.492
<i>And I think I'm rude to you sometimes...</i>
