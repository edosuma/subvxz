INTERVIEWER:
So as you've been
coaching over the years,

00:06.573 --> 00:08.609
what would you say are the
most important, uh, lessons

00:08.642 --> 00:10.277
of leadership
that you've learned?

00:12.412 --> 00:13.781
COACH K:
The very first thing is that,

00:13.814 --> 00:15.349
you know,
in order to get better,

00:15.382 --> 00:16.584
you change limits.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.651
And when you change limits,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.786
you're gonna look bad
and you're gonna fail.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.690
And at West Point,

00:22.723 --> 00:25.358
I learned that failure
was never a destination.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.696
In other words,
when you are knocked back,

00:28.729 --> 00:32.566
you know, figure out why
and then, then change.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.237
The other thing is that you're
not gonna get there alone.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.571
You know, be on a team.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.541
You know, surround yourself
with good people

00:40.574 --> 00:42.108
and learn how to listen.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.246
You're not gonna learn
with you just talking.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.650
And when you do talk,
converse,

00:49.683 --> 00:51.184
don't make excuses.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.788
Figure out the solution.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.491
And you don't have to
figure it out yourself.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.464
I always wanted to be
a part of a team

01:03.497 --> 01:05.632
and obviously I wanted
to lead that team.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.168
You know, what a,

01:08.201 --> 01:09.569
what an interesting life

01:10.637 --> 01:12.272
it is to be a leader.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.542
That's something.

No, no. I'm Richard.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.696
Okay.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.331
I'm Garrett, back wait staff.

Chef, are we done
with the forks?

04:26.333 --> 04:28.402
Yes, Chef. Almost, Chef.
Let me ask you.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.372
Every stage
shine fuckin' forks
his whole first fuckin' day?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.240
-First week.
-Week?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.241
GARRETT:
First week is forks.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.776
And if you get lucky,
you make it to spoons.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.244
Can we chill out
on the swearing, too,
please?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.145
-How long am I
supposed to be here for?
-A week.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.415
Alright.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.684
You want me to fork,
I'll fork.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.754
I'm not gonna give cousin
the satisfaction

04:46.787 --> 04:47.655
of coming home early.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.790
I can do my time
standing on one foot.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.657
So let me get this straight.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.159
He's punishing you
by making you work

04:52.192 --> 04:53.494
at the best restaurant
in the world?

04:53.527 --> 04:56.397
Yep. He's punishing me
for being ancillary.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.731
GARRETT: Great. Let me
give you some purpose then.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.433
Dry those properly.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.101
You see those streaks?
That's bad.

I've been doing this forever.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.749
Can I... wash dishes
or something?

No, we got the best
dishwashers in the world.

You're just gonna
slow 'em down.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.055
That wasn't clean.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.624
I've been doing this
for nine hours.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.458
I think I know what's clean.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.226
I'm telling you,
that's not clean.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.362
That was not clean either.
Please do them properly--

07:41.395 --> 07:43.196
Yo. They're goddamn forks.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.031
Outside.

Do you think this is
below you or something?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.039
(scoffs)

07:53.473 --> 07:56.443
Man, I think I'm 45 years old,
polishing forks.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.745
No one is asking you
to be here.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.079
I don't think anybody
remembers your name.

07:59.112 --> 07:59.946
Nice try.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.181
You think I don't know
how hard it is

08:01.214 --> 08:02.449
hiring people since COVID?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.750
We don't have that problem.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.721
You really drink
this Kool-Aid, huh?

08:07.754 --> 08:09.422
Yeah, I do.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.125
-Why?
-Because I love this, Richie.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.428
I love this so much, dude.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.732
Did you know that
when this restaurant
opened 12 years ago,

08:18.765 --> 08:21.302
it won the best restaurant
in the world the same year?

08:21.335 --> 08:23.337
It's retained three stars

08:23.370 --> 08:25.205
because we have
a waiting list that's long.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.608
Five thousand people waiting
at any given moment long.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.077
Do you see their faces
when they walk in here?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.046
How stoked they are to see us

08:32.079 --> 08:34.180
and how stoked we have to be
to serve them?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.585
It takes 200 people
to keep this place in orbit.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.520
And at any given moment,
one of those people

08:39.553 --> 08:41.455
that is waiting in line
gets to eat here.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.490
They get to spend their time
and their money here.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.025
I'm sorry, bro,

08:45.058 --> 08:47.561
but we need to have some forks
without streaks in them.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.498
Every day here
is the freaking Super Bowl.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.335
You don't have to drink
the Kool-Aid, Richie.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.605
I just need you to respect me.
I need you to respect the staff.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.206
I need you
to respect the diners.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.607
And I need you
to respect yourself.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.515
I can do respect.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.016
Lovely. I'll see you inside.

comedian and musician
Bo Burnham.

09:24.765 --> 09:28.502
On 29 at 7:15,
we have Tim and Jill Perry.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.171
They're both
Elmhurst High School teachers.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.439
And according
to Jill's Instagram,

09:32.472 --> 09:35.075
it's always been her dream to
dine at a three-star restaurant.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.045
And they have been, quote,
"Saving up for this."

09:38.078 --> 09:39.513
I wanna go
above and beyond tonight.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.248
Every supplement
and caviar, please.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.149
A tour of the kitchen,

09:42.182 --> 09:44.518
a champagne tour
in the gallery as well.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.754
And, guys, we're not gonna
let these people spend a dollar.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.188
Do not drop a check.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.257
I wanna blow
their fuckin' minds.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.425
ALL: Chef.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.160
MANAGER: Last thing,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.329
still, no one is
owning up to the smudge.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.598
I wanna clarify that it's not
so much the smudge,

09:57.631 --> 09:59.066
but rather the fact that no one

09:59.099 --> 10:01.769
is taking responsibility
for the smudge.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.505
We're not children.
It's okay to make mistakes.

10:04.538 --> 10:08.208
We can smudge things,
but we need to own up to them

10:08.241 --> 10:11.578
with immediacy,
integrity, and honesty.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.448
Does anyone wanna talk
any more about the smudge?

10:23.490 --> 10:24.458
Couple menu updates.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.427
Uh, per Chef Terry

10:26.460 --> 10:28.462
the duck roulade
will now be served

10:28.495 --> 10:30.197
with a, uh,
Concord grape reduction

10:30.230 --> 10:31.432
instead of the cherry.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.734
We're gonna be adding
a dish to the menu.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.336
That's gonna be the six-course,

10:35.369 --> 10:38.105
a Dungeness crab
with grapefruit and champagne.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.073
-Did you talk about the smudge?
-Only a lot.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.077
I know this sounds ridiculous.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.312
I am aware that I've had to say
the word fucking "smudge"

10:45.345 --> 10:47.214
20 times
in the last two days,

10:47.247 --> 10:48.782
but we had to reset
the plate with the smudge

10:48.815 --> 10:50.751
because the persimmon glaze
was smudged,

10:50.784 --> 10:52.653
which fucked the set because
we had to take it to a four-top,

10:52.686 --> 10:55.222
which meant we have to match
the other three plates

10:55.255 --> 10:57.358
to the smudge plate,
which cost us 45 seconds.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.293
-Forty-seven seconds.
-Forty-seven seconds.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.328
Now, if you cost us
that kind of time,

11:01.361 --> 11:03.297
you sure as shit
better own up to it,

11:03.330 --> 11:05.199
because we sure as shit
are gonna pay for it.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.634
Now get back to work!

11:06.667 --> 11:07.601
Fuck you, Garrett!

11:07.634 --> 11:09.002
Yes, Chef. Fuck me.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.349
(cell phone ringing)

11:30.123 --> 11:31.157

11:41.735 --> 11:45.038
No, she's great.
She's totally great. Um, yeah.

11:45.506 --> 11:48.041
Oh, yo, uh, Jimmy... Um...

-Yeah.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.481
That's ama...
Oh, she's gonna be so excited.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.383
-RICHIE: I know, right?
-That's incredible.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.185
RICHIE: Actually I got three
if you wanna come, you know.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.463
You don't have to.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.198
No, no, no. It's n... I-I...

12:11.231 --> 12:12.700
That's so sweet.
That's so sweet.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.036
Um, I... I just, uh...

12:16.770 --> 12:19.240
I know you're really busy,
so I wanted to just
tell you something,

12:19.273 --> 12:22.209
um, and it's
a little bit hard to say.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.146
Okay.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.349
Are you alright?

12:28.382 --> 12:30.717
TIFF: I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh...

12:31.485 --> 12:34.088
I just want you
to hear it from me.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.088
Um...

12:35.522 --> 12:37.024
Uh...

12:37.057 --> 12:39.059
RICHIE:
What do you mean?
Hear what?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.327
Um...

12:40.360 --> 12:43.330
Frank proposed to me.

12:44.398 --> 12:45.298
(scoffs)

12:52.806 --> 12:54.140
What did you say?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.344
I said yes.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.748
He's like a really good guy.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.718
That's great, Tiff.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.019
TIFF: Thank you.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.654
And, and I want you to know

13:07.688 --> 13:10.190
that nothing's gonna
change between us.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.559
That's awesome.

13:11.592 --> 13:13.327
TIFF:
You know. And...

13:13.360 --> 13:14.461
Um...

-GARRETT: No, I don't like--

23:19.333 --> 23:20.568
No, no, I don't like to cook.

23:20.601 --> 23:22.336
Then why you work
at a restaurant?

23:22.369 --> 23:23.703
GARRETT:
I don't know, man, because...

23:24.604 --> 23:26.439
A couple of years ago,
I had a drinking problem.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.308
And I got sober.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.078
I'm good now, you know,
like I feel healthy

23:31.111 --> 23:32.479
and I'm happy and I'm grateful.

23:33.013 --> 23:34.481
And through that experience,

23:34.514 --> 23:37.317
I learned about
acts of service and...

23:39.086 --> 23:43.057
I just like being able to serve
other people now.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.057
You know?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.328
-Service.
-GARRETT: Yeah.

23:47.361 --> 23:49.597
You know, I used to work
for this guy who used to say

23:49.630 --> 23:51.732
that taking care of people
at the highest level

23:51.765 --> 23:53.567
was like working at a hospital.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.236
You know,
like it was like medi--

23:55.269 --> 23:57.204
Okay. That's a little much.

23:57.237 --> 23:58.739
I'm just saying,
I think that's why restaurants

23:58.772 --> 24:01.608
and hospitals use
the same word, "hospitality."

24:03.343 --> 24:04.612
Yeah, no shit.

24:04.645 --> 24:06.012
Hospitality.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.219
I wanted to say thanks
for a fun week, man.
It was dope.

24:12.252 --> 24:14.188
Thank you, my man.
It was fun.

24:14.221 --> 24:16.090
GARRETT:
Yeah. Um, you know,

24:16.123 --> 24:17.458
we have a new stage
coming tomorrow morning,

24:17.491 --> 24:19.559
and, um, I think we're all
really gonna miss you here.

24:20.227 --> 24:21.595
Aah.

24:22.496 --> 24:23.597
Fuck, man.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.632
I'm just gettin' the hang of it.

24:24.665 --> 24:26.299
GARRETT:
I know, I know. I know.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.103
We have one more
shift tomorrow, but, yeah.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.170
Damn.

24:30.938 --> 24:33.039
Let me ask you,
like, what if, uh...

24:33.874 --> 24:35.743
I mean, I don't know
what the situation is like,

24:35.776 --> 24:37.043
you know, but...

24:37.844 --> 24:40.781
if something opens up,
you know...

24:40.814 --> 24:42.449
Richie.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.284
That'd be awesome,
but you know it's not my call.

24:46.386 --> 24:47.521
Alright.

24:47.554 --> 24:51.058
I mean,
I got another job anyway.

24:51.091 --> 24:54.027
I am needed elsewhere.

24:55.062 --> 24:56.162
Thanks, bro.

25:06.273 --> 25:07.440
(sighs)

25:09.476 --> 25:11.579
(exhales)

25:11.612 --> 25:13.547
(cell phone ringing)

25:16.083 --> 25:18.319
-Yo, cousin, what's up?
-What's going on?

25:18.352 --> 25:19.553
CARMY:
I'm watching Fak
do something--

25:19.587 --> 25:21.221
-FAK: I'm recalibrating.
-I'm watching Fak recalibrate.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.489
Yeah, I'm recalibrating.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.326
We, uh, we failed
the fire suppression test.

25:25.359 --> 25:26.727
Another one, dude?

25:26.760 --> 25:28.162
CARMY:
Yeah, yeah, another one.

25:28.195 --> 25:29.229
We have one more shot.

25:29.263 --> 25:31.031
RICHIE: How bad is it
if we fail that one?

25:31.064 --> 25:32.065
It's fuckin' bad--

25:32.432 --> 25:33.667
-(screams) Goddammit.
-Shit! Fuck, man!

25:33.700 --> 25:36.070
-FAK: Okay, I'm just--
-CARMY: Please be careful.

25:36.103 --> 25:37.338
It's bad, cousin.
What do you need?

25:37.371 --> 25:38.339
RICHIE: What do I need?

25:38.372 --> 25:40.440
(scoffs)
I don't need anything.

25:41.108 --> 25:43.377
-Just calling
to tell you I'm done.
-CARMY: Yes, yes.

25:43.410 --> 25:44.244
No, that's right.
How'd that go?

25:44.278 --> 25:45.713
Bro, you're going
to fuck yourself.

25:45.746 --> 25:46.714
RICHIE: It was fine.

25:46.747 --> 25:47.614
(Fak groans)

25:49.249 --> 25:51.118
Yo, I know you sent me there
to get rid of me.

25:51.151 --> 25:52.720
What... To get rid of you?
Fak. Fak. Fak!

25:52.753 --> 25:54.655
-I fucking told you.
-RICHIE: Yes.

25:54.688 --> 25:55.823
-Please!
-Yes.

25:55.856 --> 25:58.291
I was annoying you and you
wanted me out of your hair.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.027
-(Fak screams)
-What?

26:00.060 --> 26:01.228
-RICHIE: Yeah, you sent me--
-No, no.

26:01.261 --> 26:02.295
-RICHIE: No, cousin--
-No. No, no, no.

26:02.329 --> 26:03.330
-I-I-I sent you there--
-RICHIE: No, cousin.

26:03.363 --> 26:04.732
You sent me there

26:04.765 --> 26:07.167
to fucking humiliate me,
you fucking jagoff.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.069
Make me look like
a fucking jagoff.

26:09.102 --> 26:10.070
You're the fucking jagoff,
Carmen.

26:10.103 --> 26:12.039
What the fuck you talkin' about?

26:12.072 --> 26:13.607
-(screaming) Fuck! Fuck!
-Yo! Fuckin' Christ!

26:13.640 --> 26:15.175
-Fak! Jesus!
-Stop! Stop it!

26:15.208 --> 26:16.376
-CARMY: Just fuckin' stop.
-FAK: Stop!

26:16.409 --> 26:17.310
-Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
-CARMY: Take a break.

26:17.344 --> 26:18.712
FAK: I actually think
I hurt myself.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.790
(alarm beeping)

26:35.796 --> 26:37.430
(water running)

26:46.440 --> 26:47.541
Um...

27:09.763 --> 27:12.499
(clock ticking)

27:13.367 --> 27:15.468
(footsteps approaching)

27:16.002 --> 27:18.072
Hey, I'm about
to go over staff reviews.

27:18.105 --> 27:19.807
-You wanna observe?
-Oh, uh, thanks.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.175
I gotta finish this last bin.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.044
'Kay.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.514
We loved having you here.
Thanks for everything.

27:28.682 --> 27:29.716
Thanks, Chef Jess.

27:36.223 --> 27:37.190
(sighs deeply)

28:01.548 --> 28:04.551
You know where the polish is?
That bullshit keeps moving.

28:04.584 --> 28:05.752
Try that drawer over there.

28:08.388 --> 28:09.757
What are you making?

28:09.790 --> 28:12.392
I'm just peeling mushrooms
for the lamb des tournelles.

28:14.294 --> 28:15.629
Peeling mushrooms?

28:15.662 --> 28:18.098
Yeah. It's just
a nice little fun detail.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.067
So when the diners see it,
they know that someone

28:20.100 --> 28:21.368
spent a lot of time
on their dish.

28:21.401 --> 28:22.669
Do you wanna have a go?

28:23.470 --> 28:24.604
Alright.

28:25.005 --> 28:27.107
Okay, so hold it like this.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.743
-Mm-hmm.
-Knife, 1300.

28:30.844 --> 28:34.414
Grab the end
and just peel like that.

28:35.515 --> 28:36.650
So slowly.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.421
Yeah.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.659
Thirteen hundred, huh?

28:45.692 --> 28:47.194
-TERRY: Yeah.
-Did you serve?

28:47.962 --> 28:50.297
-Dad did.
-RICHIE: Yeah. Same.

28:50.664 --> 28:52.333
Staff sergeant.

28:52.366 --> 28:53.700
Corporal.

28:54.468 --> 28:55.336
A lot of standards.

28:55.369 --> 28:56.670
Yeah.

28:56.703 --> 28:58.272
Turns out, I like standards.

28:58.305 --> 28:59.372
(Richie scoffs)

29:00.841 --> 29:02.209
(Richie sighs)

29:02.810 --> 29:04.110
Did you move around a lot?

29:04.578 --> 29:06.279
Yeah. You?

29:09.583 --> 29:11.518
-I know Carmen.
-RICHIE: Yeah, I know.

29:14.288 --> 29:15.723
I'm sorry
that he pulled a favor.

29:15.756 --> 29:17.991
Not at all.
I don't do favors.

29:24.464 --> 29:26.466
-How's that?
-That's great.

29:28.602 --> 29:30.303
-Can I do another one?
-TERRY: Yes, please do.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.145
So why do you do this?

29:38.178 --> 29:40.180
(laughs) I do it for a living.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.684
No, but, like, don't you
have stages that do this shit?

29:43.717 --> 29:45.685
Yeah, well, I like
starting the day with this.

29:46.052 --> 29:49.156
-Why?
-TERRY: Respect. Feels attached.

29:49.189 --> 29:51.425
I think time spent doing this
is time well spent.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.326
RICHIE: Time well spent.

29:54.628 --> 29:56.297
That's what it's all about?

29:56.330 --> 29:58.164
Yeah, I think so.

30:01.168 --> 30:02.302
When did that start?

30:03.103 --> 30:07.374
Oh, I st... I tried to open
a giant place years ago.

30:08.375 --> 30:12.613
I had all these accolades.
I was younger, I was on fire.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.447
I was arrogant, and, uh...

30:15.749 --> 30:17.117
I tried to move too fast.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.319
I couldn't keep the place open,

30:18.352 --> 30:20.787
and the market crashed
and I got killed.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.191
Public wipeout?

30:24.224 --> 30:26.259
Oh, yeah.
The most public wipeout.

30:30.264 --> 30:31.732
So how'd this place happen?

30:31.765 --> 30:33.400
Well, now, that was on my...

30:34.334 --> 30:36.303
-My 38th birthday.
-Hmm.

30:36.670 --> 30:40.507
I was out walking all night,
unemployed, angry, depressed.

30:41.542 --> 30:44.778
Blaming everybody else
for all the time I'd lost

30:44.811 --> 30:47.314
and the money I'd lost,
all of it.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.116
And it was raining.

30:49.150 --> 30:52.186
And I was walking
through Lincoln Park.
My phone had died.

30:52.219 --> 30:55.256
And so I stood under this awning
waiting for the rain to stop.

30:55.289 --> 30:57.057
And I just stood there
and stared.

30:57.090 --> 30:58.192
And eventually the sun came up

30:58.225 --> 31:00.126
and it turns out
I was right there.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.063
And then I walked
'round to the front

31:03.697 --> 31:05.733
and I saw the sign.

31:05.766 --> 31:07.301
It was an actual sign.

31:07.334 --> 31:09.169
It was a restaurant
for lease sign.

31:10.704 --> 31:12.506
Like, um... (clicks tongue)

31:12.539 --> 31:14.308
-...never too late kinda thing.
-TERRY: Yeah.

31:14.341 --> 31:16.243
Never too late to start over.

31:22.282 --> 31:24.618
How did you get
the money to open?

31:24.651 --> 31:26.687
Um, well, my dad had died
the summer before,

31:26.720 --> 31:30.057
and only child, my mum sold
the house and put it in here.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.458
-Oh. Family business.
-TERRY: Yeah.

31:32.693 --> 31:34.028
You close with your ma?

31:34.061 --> 31:36.764
Yeah, she's my best friend.
You?

31:36.797 --> 31:39.667
My best friend's ma
was like my ma.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.767
TERRY: Ooh, yeah?

31:42.703 --> 31:44.137
What about your dad?

31:44.638 --> 31:45.739
-No.
-Yeah. (laughs)

31:45.772 --> 31:47.173
Are you close to yours?

31:48.308 --> 31:49.810
-Hmm.
-Yeah. Yeah, it's funny.

31:49.843 --> 31:53.346
I learned the most about him
when I was packing up his house.

31:54.147 --> 31:56.683
All his belongings,
like, his whole life.

31:57.618 --> 32:00.287
And I found this
stash of pocket notebooks

32:00.320 --> 32:02.222
that he must have taken with him
when he was on tour.

32:03.156 --> 32:04.692
And full of all these details,

32:04.725 --> 32:08.195
like the palm trees he'd seen
or escargot he'd tried.

32:08.228 --> 32:10.330
Or this time
the ocean looked purple.

32:10.764 --> 32:13.167
And, um, the way
he wrote everything,

32:13.200 --> 32:13.968
it was like a reminder,

32:14.001 --> 32:16.737
like a...
don't forget this moment

32:16.770 --> 32:19.607
or don't forget this
interesting, strange detail.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.775
Hundreds of these entries.

32:21.808 --> 32:22.943
JESSICA: Chef Terry?

32:22.976 --> 32:25.746
And he'd-he'd sign each one off
the same way every time.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.048
-Chef?
-Yes, Chef?

32:28.081 --> 32:29.183
Arnaud upstairs.

32:29.216 --> 32:30.551
TERRY:
Oh, thank you, Chef.

32:30.584 --> 32:31.785
Don't be a stranger, Richie.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.289
Say hi to Carmen for me.

32:35.322 --> 32:36.557
Yeah, will do.

32:36.590 --> 32:38.024
TERRY: Thank you.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.061
He believes in you,
you know.

32:41.094 --> 32:41.995
(Richie scoffs)

32:42.596 --> 32:44.131
What makes you say that?

32:44.164 --> 32:45.565
He told me.

32:46.199 --> 32:48.501
He said you're good with people.
He's not wrong.

32:52.739 --> 32:53.741
Nice talking to you, Chef.

32:53.774 --> 32:55.275
TERRY: Likewise, Chef.

32:57.377 --> 32:59.213
Uh, ch... Chef?

32:59.246 --> 33:01.649
Uh, you never said
what he signed off with.

33:01.682 --> 33:03.617
What'd your dad...
