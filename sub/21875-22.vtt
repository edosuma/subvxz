It's a pleasure.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.620
The governor has
offered Senator Knox

09:20.620 --> 09:22.420
a Ranger security detail.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.790
You two were
at the top of the list.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.630
Of course.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.690
You didn't take me seriously,

09:27.700 --> 09:28.890

09:37.110 --> 09:38.370
ALISHA:
Gentlemen,

09:38.370 --> 09:40.370

foremost in your minds.

Why us?

09:55.020 --> 09:56.260
Why do our names
always come up?

09:56.260 --> 09:57.890
There are a hundred-plus
Rangers, right?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.130
But it's always us.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.230
Why is that?
Fate.

10:00.230 --> 10:01.560
No, there's no
such thing as fate.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.630
I'll tell you
what it is.

10:02.630 --> 10:03.900
Alex volunteered us
for it.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.930
Now, why would
she do that?

10:04.930 --> 10:06.000
We're her favorite people.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.500
No. You're
her favorite people.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
I'm her second
favorite people,

10:10.610 --> 10:11.900

10:13.310 --> 10:14.440

11:22.740 --> 11:26.850
Well, cosmic fluctuation,

my only explanation.

My pleasure.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.300
You can come along anyway.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.040

to be abrupt, Mr. Boyd,

11:49.040 --> 11:51.440
but we really have to go.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.270
Look, I gotta go
pick up this senator.

11:53.270 --> 11:55.170
Why don't you hang around
and I'll give you a lift?

11:55.180 --> 11:58.080
Walker, you know I've been
a Ranger for 30 years.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.710
I don't need a mother hen.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.750
Okay, I'll see you

12:42.990 --> 12:44.260
to Rangers Walker
and Trivette.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.630
They'll be heading up

12:45.630 --> 12:47.590
your security detail.
Gentlemen.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.900
What did I tell you about
calling me Senator Knox?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.230
And you're
as beautiful as ever.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.370
Say, buddy, I got
a question for ya.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.480
There's a flight
from Denver: 421.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.480
Has it come in yet?

13:03.480 --> 13:04.610
Ah, yes, sir.

13:04.610 --> 13:05.750
We finished
deplaning about

13:05.750 --> 13:07.550
20 minutes ago.
( groans )

13:07.550 --> 13:09.620
Well, look, I'm supposed
to meet a fella here.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.750
His name is Mitchell.
There's a picture of him.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.150
You recognize him?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.590
Disregard the girl in there.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.660
She just happens to be
a Sunday school teacher.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.030
( chuckles )

13:19.030 --> 13:20.230
Look, I'm sorry.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.530
I can't give you
any information

13:21.530 --> 13:23.760
about passengers
or the flight manifest.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.100
You might check
in baggage claims.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.230
He could still be there.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.430
All right. Thank you.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.770
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

14:13.350 --> 14:15.220
MAN:
You're telling me
it isn't ready?

14:15.220 --> 14:18.250
MAN 2:
You know, quality
can't be rushed.

14:18.250 --> 14:21.220
This is built
on a Mauser action.

14:21.220 --> 14:25.830
Barrel, 26 inches,
stainless steel.

14:25.830 --> 14:28.900
Twenty-four power
transilluminated scope

14:28.900 --> 14:31.700
and a solenoid trigger.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.330
Now, that has been
adjusted to 2 ounces.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.540
You can run that up
if you wish.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.000
Where's the suppressor?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.500
Ah, yeah.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.310
This is what took the time.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.910
Old Hiram Maxim.

14:45.910 --> 14:48.750
He invented
this in 1908.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.820
I've never seen
a suppressor like this.

14:50.820 --> 14:54.490
You ordered the best,
and this is it.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.590
And these...

14:59.130 --> 15:01.130
I loaded those with

15:01.130 --> 15:02.900
a slow-burning powder.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.230
Makes for
a subsonic bullet.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.070
This .30-caliber rifle

15:09.070 --> 15:11.740
won't make any more
noise than a chicken

15:11.740 --> 15:13.710
breaking wind
in a snowstorm.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.950
( piano playing music )

15:21.950 --> 15:24.320
( indistinct chatter )

15:24.320 --> 15:25.620
Senator,
Congressman Hall.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.650
I'll have
to call him back.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.150
Okay, thanks.

15:32.830 --> 15:34.330
WALKER:
And when you finish with that,

15:34.330 --> 15:36.400
I want you to call
Southwestern Bell.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.260
I want impulse traps
on all the lines

15:38.270 --> 15:40.770
leading to
the senator's suite.

15:41.770 --> 15:42.870
Then I want
a printout sheet

15:42.870 --> 15:46.310
on all the
originating numbers.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.540
Uh, the senator's staff
will do the crosschecking.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.040
Okay. Bye.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.650
Don't you think
their conversation's

15:57.650 --> 15:58.750
a little too friendly?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.020
Have you ever known
a politician

16:00.020 --> 16:01.120
who wasn't too friendly?

16:01.120 --> 16:03.620
Now that you
mention it, no.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.360
You know, if this guy

16:05.360 --> 16:06.730
never takes a position
on anything

16:06.730 --> 16:07.890
and he never
offends anybody,

16:07.900 --> 16:09.700
I don't understand
all this security.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.300
Seems like a lot of expense
for nothing, if you ask me.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.070
Let's hope it's for nothing.
I'll check with you later.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.570
All right.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.180
( crickets chirping )

16:45.670 --> 16:46.670
What happened?

16:46.670 --> 16:48.170
Evade and elude.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.440
Can't be too careful here.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.740
Oh?

16:50.740 --> 16:52.970
You have reason to believe
you're under glass?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.310
No.

16:54.310 --> 16:55.810
( huffs )

16:55.810 --> 16:58.140
Then you be as careful as you'd
like to be, but don't ever

16:58.150 --> 17:00.050
be late again.

17:00.050 --> 17:02.520
( quietly ):
All right.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.580
Used to bring my kid here.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.280
Had infield seats.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.750
Now, they're tearing
the place down.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.819
That's progress, huh?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.220
You're from this area?

17:09.220 --> 17:13.790
Relax. I've been
deceased since 1981.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.560
Still a shame what
they're doing to the place.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.329
It's called change,
gentlemen.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.599
And that's what
we're here to do.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.030
We're here to make a change.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.099
It would be good
if you kept that in mind.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.940
Your assignment is fluid.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.569
Basically,

17:26.569 --> 17:28.569
you're here to conduct
mobile reconnaissance,

17:28.580 --> 17:31.910
surveillance and interdiction
during the operation.

17:31.910 --> 17:34.080
You'll provide security
and guard the flanks

17:34.080 --> 17:35.410
until time of termination,

17:35.420 --> 17:38.080
and that is my assignment.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.390
This is the change
that we're going to make.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.660
This is our target.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.360
Senator Julian Knox.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.870
( country music playing inside )

18:00.180 --> 18:02.140
( C.D. laughing )

18:04.850 --> 18:06.480
( laughing )

18:06.480 --> 18:08.580
Give me your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.750
The three judges
for the contest:

18:10.750 --> 18:14.490
Bob Rooney, Frank Dodge,
Billy Selkirk.

18:14.490 --> 18:15.490
Let's hear it for 'em!

18:15.490 --> 18:17.990
( applause and cheering )

18:17.990 --> 18:20.860
You noticed who got
the applause, did you not?

18:20.860 --> 18:22.230
( coughing )

18:22.230 --> 18:23.430
Where's Boyd?

18:23.430 --> 18:25.200
He ain't gonna squirrel out
on us again, is he?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.470
Hey, no squirrels
where I live in, Dodge.

18:27.470 --> 18:28.770
I gotta come to Dallas

18:28.770 --> 18:30.500
and rub shoulders with 'em.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.340
By God, we thought
you'd up and died on us.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.070
Oh, not yet.
Not just yet.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.740
You look like somethin'
the cats dug up,

18:36.740 --> 18:38.410
the dogs wouldn't eat.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.350
Yeah, he do look a little
grubby, don't he?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.820
I think I'll lend him
my razor.
Click.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.820
( all laughing )

18:46.620 --> 18:48.620
( ringing )

18:54.160 --> 18:56.930
C.D.'s.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.000
Okay.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.970
Telephone call
for Officer Ridley Burke!

19:02.500 --> 19:04.000
Ridley Burke!

19:07.740 --> 19:09.340
Yes, sir. Right here.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.280
Yeah. Take it
on that end of the bar.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
It's your wife.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.220
Hello?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.660
No, Ms. Burke,
I met him at the range.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.800
Willis. Bud Willis.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.900
Yes, ma'am.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.440
No, he said he went
straight to the range

19:36.440 --> 19:37.640
to get some practice.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.340
That's why he hasn't
checked in yet.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.680
No.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.440
( chuckles ):
No. No.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.880
I wouldn't think there's
any need for concern.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.480
I'd be glad to.
As soon as I see him.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.990
Yes, ma'am.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.120
Well, thank you.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.090
ALL:
♪ Not half as much as me ♪

20:02.100 --> 20:04.260
♪ She cried so
When I left her ♪

20:04.270 --> 20:06.600
♪ It almost
Broke my heart ♪

20:06.600 --> 20:08.530
♪ And if I ever find her ♪

20:08.540 --> 20:11.470
♪ We nevermore
Will part ♪

20:20.650 --> 20:23.220
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I didn't see you.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.850
Are you
always so jumpy?

20:24.850 --> 20:27.020
Long hours. I'm, uh...

20:27.020 --> 20:28.960
a little edgy,
a little grumpy, I guess.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.660
Sorry.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.960
You a cop too?

20:31.960 --> 20:34.430
No. My ex was.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.500
I feel at home
around these guys.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.160
Jessica Pritchard.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.030
"Jesse" to old friends...

20:41.040 --> 20:42.670
and new ones.

20:42.670 --> 20:46.000
Well, yes, ma'am.

20:46.010 --> 20:50.180
Ridley Burke, sergeant,
Kansas City Police Department.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.180
KNOX:
How long have you been
a Ranger, Trivette?

20:56.650 --> 20:58.220
Little over a year, sir.

20:58.220 --> 20:59.890
Really? You must be
damn proud of yourself.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.560
I know I would be.
Would you like a drink?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.920
Not while I'm on duty, sir.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.290
Ah. Of course.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.790
Duty.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.160
Alex thinks
a great deal of you,

21:12.170 --> 21:14.700
you and that
other Ranger, Walker?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.170
Have you known her long?

21:16.170 --> 21:17.300
A while.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.770
She and I went
to law school together.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.310
Of course, I was
a few years ahead of her,

21:20.310 --> 21:22.270
but we were, uh...

21:22.280 --> 21:25.240
We knew each other.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.250
Can you think
of anything

21:26.250 --> 21:28.280
that would hold Alex
here in Dallas?

21:28.280 --> 21:30.680
I'm not sure what
you mean by "hold her."

21:30.690 --> 21:33.550
Well, like a relationship,
family.

21:33.550 --> 21:34.890
I understand
she's not married.

21:34.890 --> 21:36.790
No, sir,
she's not married.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.090
But I understand you are.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.160
Oh, yeah.

21:46.370 --> 21:49.470
Well, I'd like
to hang out with you boys

21:49.470 --> 21:50.740
until the sun comes up,

21:50.740 --> 21:52.770
but I got to get
my beauty sleep.

21:52.770 --> 21:53.770
I'll give you a lift.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.340
Not necessary.
I'll walk.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.140
Get my stop on the way.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.940
I got this little itch,

21:58.950 --> 22:01.210
and I'd like
to get it scratched.

22:01.210 --> 22:02.210
See ya, parson.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.220
Heh.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.690
He jokes, he drinks,
dances, he sings.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.760
Hell, he's a regular
Fred Astaire.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.630
C.D., you've known him
for...30 years.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.730
Don't you think
it's kind of strange

22:17.730 --> 22:19.100
the way he's been acting?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.070
Damn strange.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.070
I'll see you
tomorrow, partner.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.350
( dance music playing inside )

22:43.520 --> 22:45.420
( groans )

22:53.470 --> 22:54.970
Look here, young fella.

22:54.970 --> 22:56.940
You sure you're old enough
to be in here?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.100
I'm exactly 21 years old.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.270
You wanna see some ID,
fat boy?

23:01.270 --> 23:03.610
Some people might take offense
to gas like that.

23:03.610 --> 23:07.580
Does Delong
still own this joint,

23:07.580 --> 23:09.720
or has the sanitation
department foreclosed?

23:09.720 --> 23:10.750
Look--

23:10.750 --> 23:12.650
I might take offense
to that one, Boyd.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.830
Thought you were dead.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.860
Well, maybe
I'm supposed to be.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.930
But I'm just being
stubborn about it.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.900
What a disappointment.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.570
Delong, I wanna
test your memory.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.670
Recognize this fella?

23:31.670 --> 23:33.810
Uh...no.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.310
What about the girl?

23:35.980 --> 23:38.110
Hm? No. No.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.310
Ow! Ah!

23:40.310 --> 23:41.950
Now, I'm gonna tell you
something now.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.180
You'd better listen to me.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.520
I want you to turn around
and look at that statue.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.050
Go on.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.320
You see it?
Yeah.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.760
Well, that's the same statue
that's in this photo.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.860
And that was taken
less than eight months ago.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.930
We think this guy's
name is Mitchell, hm?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.400
We know he likes
the strippers

24:03.400 --> 24:05.040
and the dancing girls.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.540
Now, do you remember him?

24:06.540 --> 24:08.040
He was in, okay? To watch.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.770
For drinks and tips,

24:09.780 --> 24:11.110
anybody can have
a picture taken.

24:11.110 --> 24:12.110
Anybody.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.750
Yeah.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.780
Anybody, huh?

24:15.780 --> 24:17.920
Okay, I want you
to let me know

24:17.920 --> 24:18.950
when he comes around again.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.950
Now, you understand that?

24:20.960 --> 24:21.950
Do you?

24:27.530 --> 24:29.660
You're not a Ranger anymore.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.160
Oh, I'm glad
you know that, Delong.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.870
I'm real glad you know that.

24:33.870 --> 24:36.470
'Cause now
I'm not bound by any oaths.

24:36.470 --> 24:39.340
I want that friend of yours!
I want him real bad.

24:39.340 --> 24:41.510
You catch my drift?

24:41.510 --> 24:44.480
You contact me, now.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.090
Don't just stand there.
Get after him!

25:08.600 --> 25:09.670
Get him.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.670
Where do you think
you're going, old--

25:14.680 --> 25:15.740
( punch connects )

25:23.880 --> 25:25.050
How's it going?

25:25.050 --> 25:27.020
Oh, I could use a little help.
Okay.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.360
( screams )

25:39.370 --> 25:41.070
I'm gonna sue you, Boyd!

25:41.070 --> 25:42.500
You broke my fingers!

25:42.500 --> 25:43.840
This was his fault, Walker!

25:43.840 --> 25:45.140
He started it!

25:45.140 --> 25:46.910
You son of a--

25:50.610 --> 25:51.940
You wanna press charges?

25:51.950 --> 25:53.210
No, I don't think so.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.410
Not you, him.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.080
Yeah. Matter of fact, I do.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.520
I'm gonna
finish that job.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.450
WALKER:
Whoa. Whoa.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.220
Let's go.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.260
( sighs )

26:04.260 --> 26:05.590
Well?

26:05.590 --> 26:07.290
Well, what?

26:07.290 --> 26:09.830
What are you doing
in a joint like that?

26:09.830 --> 26:11.630
That's a silly
question, Walker.

26:11.630 --> 26:13.430
I went to see
the dancing girls.

26:13.430 --> 26:15.430
And those four gorillas
came out here and jumped you

26:15.440 --> 26:16.530
because you're watching.

26:16.540 --> 26:18.470
Well, not exactly.

26:18.470 --> 26:20.440
What, exactly?

26:20.440 --> 26:23.840
Well, Mr. Ranger Walker,
in case you haven't noticed,

26:23.840 --> 26:25.010
I'm not dead yet.

26:25.010 --> 26:28.880
Well, Mr. Ranger Boyd,
you may not be dead yet,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.020
but you could act your age.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.820
Now, what in almighty hell

26:32.820 --> 26:34.390
would I wanna do
anything like that for?

26:34.390 --> 26:36.290
WOMAN ( over radio ):
<i> Ranger Walker, this is base.</i>

26:36.290 --> 26:38.790
<i> 2847 for Walker.</i>

26:38.790 --> 26:40.060
Walker.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.960
<i> At Taylor and Long,</i>
<i> McClelland Guns.</i>

26:41.960 --> 26:44.760
<i> Parole supervisor</i>
<i> Sergeant Slater, D.P.D.,</i>

26:44.770 --> 26:47.130
<i> requires your assistance.</i>

26:47.130 --> 26:49.500
I'm on my way.
You wanna go for a ride?

26:49.500 --> 26:52.270
For sure. Maybe we can
scare up some excitement

26:52.270 --> 26:53.710
before the evening's over.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.240
That's all you need
is more excitement.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.550
SLATER:
His name's Arden Lee Stuart.

27:06.550 --> 27:08.720
He's 72 years old.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.890
He's owned this shop
for over 30 years.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.590
He's had an FFL forever.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.230
M.E. been here?

27:18.230 --> 27:19.500
Yeah. Homicide too.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.100
I asked 'em to leave
everything alone

27:21.100 --> 27:22.670
till you got here.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.900
You know, you gave a seminar
last year about knives.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.770
The difference between,
uh, stabbing weapons

27:27.770 --> 27:28.970
and hacking weapons.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.610
How most knife kills are messy.

27:31.610 --> 27:34.910
Both M.E. and Homicide
were unsure.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.680
Autopsy will tell, of course,
but, uh, what do you think?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.250
Well...

27:40.250 --> 27:43.460
there's a hairline puncture
underneath the sternum.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.790
Did M.E. find this?

27:45.790 --> 27:47.290
Not right away.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.970
There's a puncture
right to the kidney.

27:55.970 --> 27:58.000
Just a speck of blood.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.440
Looks like he's been dead
three to six hours.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.110
Check with M.E.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.810
See if they found a bruise
on the small of his back.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.780
Yeah.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.480
( pen scribbling )

28:09.480 --> 28:12.890
Commando hit,
military style.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.450
Yeah.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.060
Thirty-caliber,

28:21.060 --> 28:23.060
240-grain Bothell
hollow points.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.630
What are they,
hunting rounds?

28:24.630 --> 28:26.600
The two-legged kind.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.170
That's filled
with mercury.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.470
( chuckles )

28:29.470 --> 28:31.270
Whoa, that can do
a lot of damage.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.510
What the devil
is this?

28:37.240 --> 28:39.780
Electronic
ranging equipment.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.680
Did this guy
make custom rifles?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.620
We haven't found
that out yet.

28:45.620 --> 28:47.590
We've got
his sales records.

28:47.590 --> 28:49.660
Have to check them
against his inventory list

28:49.660 --> 28:51.760
and his serial numbers.

28:57.870 --> 29:02.170
Richwood-Casey stock oil.

29:02.170 --> 29:04.170
There was a rifle
in this mount

29:04.170 --> 29:06.200
until a few hours ago.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.120
Laredo, come take
a look at this.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.660
SLATER:
What's that?

29:27.860 --> 29:29.560
Mm.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.200
Blueprints...

29:31.200 --> 29:33.070
for a Maxim device.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.330
Or he was building...

29:36.340 --> 29:38.500
automobile mufflers.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.910
BOYD:
I don't get it.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.840
Silencers.

29:42.840 --> 29:47.050
That's what it is.
Just what it is.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.290
( alarm beeping )

29:53.290 --> 29:55.750
Do you have
to leave so early?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.360
( chuckling )

29:57.360 --> 29:59.220
You've heard
the admonition,

29:59.230 --> 30:02.690
"To rest
is not to conquer"?

30:02.700 --> 30:04.300
Mm. Yeah.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.960
Who said so?
Me.

30:06.970 --> 30:10.240
( giggling )

30:10.240 --> 30:12.940
Who said anything
about rest?

30:21.850 --> 30:23.950
You really
are something.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.420
Yeah, I know.

30:25.420 --> 30:27.850
It's not the first time
I heard it, either.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.420
Oh, really?

30:30.420 --> 30:33.690
Well, you tell me
all about that.

30:33.690 --> 30:36.430
You keep things warm
for me till I get back.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.270
Maybe I'll be out.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.070
No, you won't.

30:45.070 --> 30:48.040
You sound
real sure of that.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.540
I am.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.180
You get another
hour's sleep.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.780
"To rest is not to conquer."

30:55.780 --> 30:57.350
( snickers )

31:01.620 --> 31:03.520
Actually,
that's a quotation.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.860
I didn't make that up.

31:04.860 --> 31:06.230
Mm. Who did?

31:06.230 --> 31:08.990
Adolf Hitler.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.560
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

31:17.600 --> 31:19.040
( door opens )

31:19.040 --> 31:20.410
( indistinct chatter )

31:23.880 --> 31:26.040
Miles, your continued support
will be the cornerstone.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.050
I won't forget it.

31:27.050 --> 31:29.650
You've earned it all, Julian.

31:29.650 --> 31:33.620
Next November, the world
will know what I already know.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.820
Oh, can you make
the shooting competition?

31:35.820 --> 31:38.790
The awards ceremony presents
an excellent photo opportunity.

31:38.790 --> 31:40.160
The police leagues
and the unions,

31:40.160 --> 31:41.390
they really eat this up.

31:41.390 --> 31:43.560
I-I'm not sure that
I can clear my schedule.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.500
I may have to make it
a possibility.

31:45.500 --> 31:49.430
But the banquet is definite.
I'll see you then.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.990
Well...

32:15.000 --> 32:16.830
Finally.

32:16.830 --> 32:18.660
Old feelings
are still with me.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.400
Do you ever reflect
on those times?

32:20.400 --> 32:24.570
Sure. But we were
very different people then.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.670
I mean, you always seemed
to know where you were going.

32:27.670 --> 32:29.740
I had no course plotted.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.380
Took me a while to find it,
and I have.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.610
I'm not so sure of that.

32:34.610 --> 32:37.080
I mean, there's, uh--

32:37.080 --> 32:41.190
More out there than you can
find being an assistant DA.

32:41.190 --> 32:43.420
And I can make it happen
for you too, Alex.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.320
How could you
find the time?

32:45.330 --> 32:48.630
You have a full career,
two children,

32:48.630 --> 32:50.260
a beautiful wife.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.600
A politician is supposed
to have a family.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.800
It was an expedient thing.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.070
There's been nothing between
my wife and I for years.

32:59.070 --> 33:00.910
You satisfied
with that arrangement?

33:00.910 --> 33:03.610
No, of course not.
But I allowed it to happen.

33:03.610 --> 33:05.440
But that's going to change.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.310
Listen.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.680
Would you have dinner
with me tomorrow?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.480
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.490
Something that might brighten
both of our futures.

33:13.490 --> 33:14.990
For old times.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.160
( knocking on door )

33:19.160 --> 33:21.530
Trivette, it's Walker.

33:24.430 --> 33:26.300
Hi, honey.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.370
Did you get my messages?

33:28.370 --> 33:29.930
Yeah.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.540
Brian Haller character.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.870
Specializes in high-grade
chrome steel and machine tools.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.240
Moves around a lot.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.410
Right now, he's got a company
called Tetrascope.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.150
That's his latest address.

33:40.150 --> 33:41.410
Where'd you get his name from?

33:41.420 --> 33:44.280
Boyd found it on an invoice
at the gun shop.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.550
Any yellow sheet on him?

33:45.550 --> 33:48.150
Yeah. Not much in it, though.

33:48.150 --> 33:50.560
Some of his customers
are a little shaky.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.390
But there's no law
on selling steel and tools.

33:52.390 --> 33:55.260
Tried to go international
a couple of years ago

33:55.260 --> 33:56.860
without
the proper licensing,

33:56.860 --> 33:58.760
but all he wound up doing
was paying a fine.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.800
Any word about
the medical examiner's report

34:04.800 --> 34:07.010
on the gunsmith?

34:07.010 --> 34:08.110
Probably later today
or...

34:08.110 --> 34:09.340
Good morning,
Walker.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.510
Hi, Alex.

34:10.510 --> 34:13.150
I'll catch up with you
a little later.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.780
KNOX:
Alex, so, uh...

34:15.780 --> 34:19.380
Tomorrow evening then,
uh...8?

34:19.389 --> 34:21.420
Yes. Bye.

34:23.090 --> 34:25.090
Morning, Ranger.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.760
My, what big eyes
you have.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.830
Yeah, well, you got egg
on your shirt.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.940
MAN:
We'll meet you at the car.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.050
I saw your assistant DA
when she came out.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.850
She sure seemed
to be in a happy mood.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.389
So?

34:56.389 --> 34:59.120
Well, did you run into her
when you were up there?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.930
Well, did ya?

35:02.930 --> 35:05.730
Well, what if I did?
You mind getting in?

35:10.540 --> 35:12.670
WOMAN (over radio):
<i> All units, all units, 2-11.</i>

35:12.670 --> 35:14.170
<i> Officer down</i>
<i> at Skillman and Abrams.</i>

35:14.170 --> 35:16.170
<i> Shots have been fired.</i>

35:16.180 --> 35:18.710
( tires screeching )

35:18.710 --> 35:19.710
Back off!

35:19.710 --> 35:21.280
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

35:21.280 --> 35:22.810
I said, back off!

35:22.820 --> 35:24.580
( woman whimpering )

35:30.420 --> 35:33.090
MAN:
I'll kill her!

35:33.090 --> 35:35.160
Back off!

35:35.160 --> 35:36.660
What's the situation here?

35:36.660 --> 35:37.960
Well, we nailed
one suspect.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.670
The other one shot my partner
and took a hostage.

35:40.670 --> 35:43.500
I'll kill her!
Back off!

35:47.270 --> 35:49.440
Hey, what's he doing?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.910
I'll kill her!

35:54.380 --> 35:55.910
Damn it.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.950
You gonna be all right, son?

35:58.950 --> 36:00.550
Yeah.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.590
I'll kill her!

36:06.590 --> 36:08.760
Stay away.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.400
I'll kill her, old man.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.070
You're gonna shoot somebody,
you shoot me.

36:14.070 --> 36:16.170
I'll kill her!

36:16.170 --> 36:18.170
Come on.
Give me that thing.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.010
Come on.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.520
Give it to me.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.300
All right, boy.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.600
On your belly.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.700
OFFICER:
Let's go, bring him in.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.010
Bring him in.
All right, let's go.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.580
Stay down.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.040
Stay down,
buddy.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.310
Easy.

37:00.310 --> 37:01.410
You okay?

37:01.410 --> 37:03.250
BOYD:
He'll be all right, huh?

37:03.250 --> 37:04.880
WALKER:
Yeah, looks like
a flesh wound.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.020
OFFICER:
We got him.
You guys can head on back.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.350
OFFICER 2:
Let's clear it.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.360
What the hell you trying to do?
Get yourself killed?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.990
Come on, Walker.
Lighten up.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.660
None of us live forever.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.530
OFFICER:
Tommy, go ahead.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.200
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

37:32.080 --> 37:35.110
I swear...

37:35.110 --> 37:37.320
I'll keep my word.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.780
I swear.

37:52.430 --> 37:54.800
Ranger Walker,
I'm Brian Haller.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.770
I'm, uh, sorry I can't
offer you my hand.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.570
I had a caller
this morning.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.340
A caller?

38:01.340 --> 38:02.810
Yeah,
an elderly gentleman.

38:02.810 --> 38:05.840
He, uh, had a very blunt way
of asking questions

38:05.850 --> 38:08.250
and a total lack
of understanding

38:08.250 --> 38:10.310
when he didn't get the answers
he was looking for.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.980
Kind of
a barrel-chested guy?

38:11.990 --> 38:13.420
Yeah, like a ranch hand.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.090
He came to my house
before sun-up.

38:16.090 --> 38:17.720
Do you know who he is?

38:17.720 --> 38:20.990
I have a good idea.
What did he want?

38:20.990 --> 38:24.800
Well, he had a picture
of a man he called Mitchell.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.000
He had a stripper
on his lap.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.870
I mean, he was familiar,
but I can't remember.

38:30.870 --> 38:32.270
I don't remember
who he is.

38:32.270 --> 38:33.910
Well, I'm not here
for that.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.470
I'm here to talk to you

38:35.480 --> 38:38.080
about a shipment
of chrome steel tubing.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.910
Do you have any idea

38:39.910 --> 38:41.880
what a Mr. Stewart
was using it for?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.510
No.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.480
Well, I do.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.220
He was manufacturing
silencers illegally.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.450
Look, I hardly
have any control

38:50.460 --> 38:52.020
over any
of the products I sell.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.460
I mean, once they're delivered,
it's out of my hands.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.330
Are you the sole owner
of this company?

38:56.330 --> 38:59.330
No, I-I manage it
for Gant Industries.

38:59.330 --> 39:02.770
Gant? Is that a public
or private company?

39:02.770 --> 39:05.000
It's a division
of Sidley International.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.810
It's a, uh--

39:06.810 --> 39:07.810
Conglomerate.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.470
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.310
Well, tell me something.

39:11.310 --> 39:14.010
Do you have any idea who's
in charge of this spider web?

39:14.010 --> 39:17.180
Uh-- Uh, not beyond
the level of Gant.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.180
W-what does this have
to do with anything?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.420
Nothing.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.020
Sorry about the fingers.

39:23.020 --> 39:25.260
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

39:33.770 --> 39:35.230
Yeah, this is Haller.

39:35.230 --> 39:37.040
Get me the chairman
right away.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.540
( country music playing )

39:39.540 --> 39:41.910
There used
to be a good reason

39:41.910 --> 39:43.270
for getting up
early in the morning

39:43.280 --> 39:45.110
and staying up
late at night.

39:45.110 --> 39:48.210
You just miss
the good old days.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.080
Well--
Hell, we all do.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.080
Well, there oughta
be a way to go back.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.250
Hell, I never saw myself
playing dominoes

39:55.260 --> 39:56.920
with a bunch
of other old duffers.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.720
Hey, Robo.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.230
There's no action
in this place.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.860
Yeah, looks like
a retirement home.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.830
( young men laughing )

40:04.830 --> 40:06.800
MAN:
That ain't funny, sonny.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.000
Hey, fellas, sure
am happy you're in here.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.340
It's just a little bit early
for all this, isn't it?

40:12.340 --> 40:14.670
Not for anybody
under 80, gramps.

40:14.670 --> 40:15.870
( young men laughing )

40:15.880 --> 40:18.010
Do you think
he's talking about us?

40:20.980 --> 40:23.850
That's right, wrinkles.
I mean you.

40:23.850 --> 40:27.150
Don't let your mouth overload
your butt there, cowboy.

40:27.150 --> 40:30.420
Look, fellas, let's--
Let's just cool it.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.190
We haven't had a fight
in here in five years.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.930
BOYD:
Well, you're overdue.

40:34.690 --> 40:36.460
Yeah, all right!
All right.

40:44.770 --> 40:46.900
( grunting )

40:49.680 --> 40:50.910
( dominoes clattering )

41:01.450 --> 41:03.790
Where's the rest of 'em?

41:03.790 --> 41:05.360
Whew.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.990
Give us a beer.

41:10.030 --> 41:12.000
( dance music playing inside )

41:15.640 --> 41:17.200
MAN:
Come on, baby. Shake it!

41:17.200 --> 41:18.800
Yee-haw!

41:25.350 --> 41:27.450
What's going on?

41:27.450 --> 41:29.810
I don't want you
around here, mister.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.050
You got a couple of Ranger
pit bulls looking for you.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.380
They're as nasty
as they come.

41:33.390 --> 41:34.790
Who are they?

41:34.790 --> 41:37.420
Cordell Walker
and Laredo Jake Boyd.

41:37.420 --> 41:39.560
If you don't know them now,
you surely will before long.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.190
Now, you drift.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.660
( country music playing )

41:48.200 --> 41:50.900
You missed
all the fun, Walker.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.270
Just like old times.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.710
I know that look, Walker.
What's up?

41:57.710 --> 41:59.340
Who's Mitchell?

42:00.110 --> 42:01.580
( sighs )

42:01.580 --> 42:03.450
Oh, I see.

42:03.450 --> 42:05.350
You went over and talked
to Mr. Haller, huh?

42:05.350 --> 42:07.420
Well, not soon enough.

42:08.220 --> 42:09.820
Could I see the photograph?

42:09.820 --> 42:11.660
Sure.

42:14.690 --> 42:17.030
Who is he?

42:17.030 --> 42:18.700
I don't know.
I'll let you know

42:18.700 --> 42:20.030
when I find out.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.070
Come on, Laredo.

42:21.070 --> 42:23.130
All right, all right.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.040
Well, he belonged
to a small group

42:25.040 --> 42:28.170
that murdered a federal witness
in Denver a year ago.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.680
They put a hit on him before
he had a chance to testify

42:30.680 --> 42:32.040
before the grand jury.

42:33.610 --> 42:39.220
They also killed a young
Denver P.D. officer.

42:39.220 --> 42:41.550
He was guarding him.

42:41.550 --> 42:44.390
And that's when
I got interested.

42:44.390 --> 42:46.920
I'm not even sure
that Mitchell's his real name.

42:46.930 --> 42:48.290
Where'd you get
this photograph?

42:48.290 --> 42:51.160
Some guttersnipe.
Owed me a favor.

42:51.160 --> 42:54.500
He was talking
about some shadow people.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.430
They were dark, dark.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.470
Black Boys?

42:57.470 --> 42:58.740
That could have been it.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.240
What does that mean, Walker?

43:00.240 --> 43:02.970
They're professional assassins
who have no identities.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.310
Oh, boy.

43:05.310 --> 43:08.810
I can't take those punches
like I used to be able to.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.280
Come on, I'll get you
to the hotel.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.850
Yeah.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.820
How you feeling?

43:18.830 --> 43:20.290
Better.

43:20.290 --> 43:22.490
Look, I got a little bit
of stress problems, that's all.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.960
You? Stress?
Yeah.

43:24.970 --> 43:26.900
Well, that's what happens
when you don't get out

43:26.900 --> 43:28.970
and raise a little bit
of hell now and then.

43:28.970 --> 43:30.940
(<i> action theme playing</i> )

43:33.870 --> 43:35.510
Walker, watch out! Watch it!

43:37.380 --> 43:39.280
( tires squealing )

43:40.710 --> 43:41.910
It's him!
Who?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.110
( gunshot )
It's Mitchell!

43:44.620 --> 43:46.120
Give me that gun.

43:49.490 --> 43:50.520
( gunshot )

43:51.620 --> 43:52.920
( gunshot )

43:54.690 --> 43:56.030
( shotgun clicks )

43:56.030 --> 43:57.630
( gunshot )

44:03.040 --> 44:04.030
( two gunshots )

44:15.780 --> 44:17.720
( tires screeching )

44:23.220 --> 44:25.090
( honking )

45:18.540 --> 45:20.180
( tires screeching )

45:28.020 --> 45:29.390
( gunshot )

45:32.190 --> 45:33.660
MAN: Get out of here!
MAN 2: Let's go!

45:51.810 --> 45:54.250
( man groaning )

45:57.680 --> 45:58.820
Laredo, give me the gun!

46:01.220 --> 46:02.450
No, I'm gonna get him!

46:11.930 --> 46:13.060
Laredo!

46:14.300 --> 46:16.530
Here, get him.
He's getting away.

46:16.540 --> 46:17.700
Never mind him.
Where you hit?

46:17.700 --> 46:19.140
No, I'm not hit.

46:19.140 --> 46:20.740
I'm not over
that last session yet.

46:20.740 --> 46:22.870
Oh, I'm sorry, Walker.
I'm sorry.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.340
All right.
Come on, let's go.

46:31.720 --> 46:35.150
I will handle it.

46:35.820 --> 46:36.850
( phone beeps )

46:38.760 --> 46:41.360
I will, uh...

46:42.600 --> 46:45.200
be taking my place
in the firearms competition.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.730
I'll provide all of you
with a detailed terrain drawing.

46:47.730 --> 46:50.570
Now, however,
the possibility does exist

46:50.570 --> 46:52.600
the plan may change.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.470
Or be modified.

46:54.470 --> 46:58.080
We'll adjust our approach
to take full advantage

46:58.080 --> 47:00.440
of whatever special conditions
may develop.

47:00.450 --> 47:04.280
Yet we'll keep in mind
that we control all situations

47:04.280 --> 47:07.690
because we know
what actions will take place.

47:07.690 --> 47:11.290
While our target...

47:11.290 --> 47:12.760
does not.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.320
Ugh!

47:26.240 --> 47:28.870
He came to life again
in a photograph.

47:28.870 --> 47:30.780
It's always a mistake.

47:30.780 --> 47:32.540
And...

47:32.550 --> 47:35.410
he lost direction.

47:37.550 --> 47:41.090
He began to freelance
to try to clean up his own mess.

47:41.090 --> 47:43.120
There are two rangers
named Walker and Boyd.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.920
We may have
to eliminate them.

47:47.160 --> 47:50.460
You'll take care
of Mr. Mitchell's body, yes?

47:52.330 --> 47:55.170
I'll see
to a replacement.

48:00.770 --> 48:02.740
Mr. Douglas
is on line three.

48:02.740 --> 48:04.080
Oh, thank you.

48:11.150 --> 48:13.350
Mr. Douglas.

48:13.350 --> 48:15.590
Certainly. Go ahead.

48:15.590 --> 48:18.560
I've sent a messenger
with a revised guest list.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.160
You'll want to give him
a copy to Senator Knox.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.830
I propose we have him

48:22.830 --> 48:25.130
<i> present the trophies</i>
<i> at the range</i>

48:25.130 --> 48:26.930
<i> immediately following</i>
<i> the competition.</i>

48:26.930 --> 48:30.200
T-That way,
his only duty after dinner

48:30.200 --> 48:31.870
would be his policy speech.

48:31.870 --> 48:33.900
I'll be having dinner
with the senator this evening.

48:33.910 --> 48:35.210
I'll run these changes by him.

48:35.210 --> 48:36.810
I'm sure they'll meet
with his approval.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.640
Thank you.
Enjoy your evening.

48:40.650 --> 48:42.150
Goodbye.

48:42.150 --> 48:43.710
(<i> sinister theme playing</i> )

48:48.720 --> 48:51.120
When I present
Knox's replacement,

48:51.120 --> 48:53.220
his image will carry
any election

48:53.230 --> 48:56.130
regardless of party
or platform.

48:56.130 --> 48:59.500
He'll be the candidate
and president I own.

49:01.300 --> 49:04.400
Mr. Valentine,
I'd hoped to avoid a meeting,

49:04.400 --> 49:06.940
but the situation involving
the late Mr. Mitchell

49:06.940 --> 49:09.740
may have jeopardized
this operation.

49:09.740 --> 49:11.240
One more point.

49:11.240 --> 49:16.950
This, uh, retired Ranger, Boyd?
Is he a potential for trouble?

49:16.950 --> 49:19.350
The real danger is Walker.
He's the hunter.

49:19.350 --> 49:21.950
I know Ranger Walker.
You're right.

49:21.950 --> 49:24.420
My sources tell me
Boyd seems obsessed

49:24.420 --> 49:28.660
by, uh, the death
of a policeman in Denver.

49:28.660 --> 49:31.660
Was, uh-- Mitchell
responsible for that?

49:31.660 --> 49:33.830
No.

49:33.830 --> 49:36.970
I'm responsible
for that officer's removal.

49:40.210 --> 49:43.670
Rangers have a relentless
reputation too, Mr. Valentine.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.380
Indeed, they do.

49:45.380 --> 49:47.410
Indeed.

49:47.410 --> 49:50.510
I do believe I have
the advantage you see, though.

49:50.520 --> 49:53.220
I know what I'm going to do.

49:53.220 --> 49:56.150
They don't.

49:59.430 --> 50:00.760
( gunshots )

50:05.400 --> 50:07.830
Who said Walker's gonna have
a tough time this year?

50:07.830 --> 50:10.730
Yeah, who said that?
Where's C.D.?

50:10.740 --> 50:12.470
He's the oddsmaker.
( gunshots )

50:12.470 --> 50:15.170
That ain't right
that the judges can't bet.

50:15.170 --> 50:16.870
Well, we'll change
the rules next year.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.610
Well, that's what we said
last year.

50:18.610 --> 50:21.380
Forgetful.
You boys are forgetful.

50:21.380 --> 50:24.450
( chuckling ):
Forgetful about what?

50:38.330 --> 50:39.800
MAN ( over PA ):
<i> Ranger Cordell Walker</i>

50:39.800 --> 50:41.500
<i> completes his qualifying round</i>

50:41.500 --> 50:45.440
<i> in 33 seconds</i>
<i> with a perfect score.</i>

50:45.440 --> 50:47.670
( applause and chattering )

51:11.760 --> 51:14.000
That was fine shooting, Ranger.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.400
Thanks.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.400
Name's Walker.
Cordell Walker.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.540
Burke. Ridley Burke.
K.C.P.D. Kansas.

51:19.540 --> 51:21.440
Well, good luck.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.310
Does luck have a lot
to do with it?

51:23.310 --> 51:25.580
Well, doesn't hurt.

51:25.580 --> 51:26.640
( chuckling )

51:26.650 --> 51:28.750
<i> Next up, Sergeant Ridley Burke.</i>

51:28.750 --> 51:30.510
<i> Kansas City P.D.</i>

51:30.520 --> 51:33.080
<i> Two. One.</i>

51:33.090 --> 51:34.350
<i> Go.</i>
( beep )

51:45.530 --> 51:46.700
( gunshots )

51:53.610 --> 51:55.210
Hey.
Hey.

51:55.210 --> 51:57.110
You taking him out
on the course?

51:57.110 --> 51:59.410
No, the senator
doesn't like loud noises.

51:59.410 --> 52:02.110
That's hard to believe.
He's a military hawk.

52:02.110 --> 52:03.950
Not hard at all,
actually.

52:03.950 --> 52:06.480
Look, I want you
to fire up the computer.

52:06.490 --> 52:10.190
Run a check
on this guy, Mitchell.

52:10.190 --> 52:12.290
That's what
he looks like.

52:12.930 --> 52:14.630
"Jack Mitchell"?

52:14.630 --> 52:16.190
Probably an alias.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.060
By the way, did you find out
anything on the car

52:18.060 --> 52:19.330
or the autopsy?

52:19.330 --> 52:21.000
Just the car. It's stolen.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.800
I got a break
between shifts,

52:22.800 --> 52:24.940
so I'll get what I can
on this Mitchell guy for you.

52:29.910 --> 52:32.180
<i> Sergeant Burke completes</i>
<i> his qualifying round.</i>

52:32.180 --> 52:34.910
<i> A perfect score</i>
<i> in just 32 seconds.</i>

52:34.910 --> 52:36.180
Hey.

52:36.180 --> 52:38.150
Good shooting.

52:38.150 --> 52:39.550
Well, thank you.

52:39.550 --> 52:42.620
Perfect score. It's all skill.
No luck involved.

52:46.760 --> 52:49.630
All right, this stuff came
from National Personnel Service

52:49.630 --> 52:50.890
in St. Louis.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.500
There are over 700 Mitchells
that fit the profile

52:53.500 --> 52:55.530
and your photo ID
didn't help narrow it.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.170
So I had to do it
the hard way.

52:57.170 --> 52:58.570
In terms of service.

52:58.570 --> 53:00.840
And you got all those papers
out of that machine?

53:00.840 --> 53:02.910
That's just part of it.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.440
Mitchell's last name
could be short for Jackson.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.110
It could be a nickname
for "John,"

53:09.120 --> 53:10.680
or the whole thing
could be an alias.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.980
But aliases
are sometimes similar.

53:12.990 --> 53:14.350
Hm.
But--

53:14.350 --> 53:16.490
This guy doesn't use one word
when 1000 will do, does he?

53:16.490 --> 53:17.990
Cut to the chase,
Trivette.

53:17.990 --> 53:20.860
What I'm saying is,
I had to go back to the photo.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.030
You see what looks like a shadow
at the base of the throat?

53:24.030 --> 53:25.700
Yeah.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.260
That's a birthmark.

53:27.270 --> 53:29.330
Those are recorded.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.100
His name
is Jackson Hale Mitchelson.

53:32.100 --> 53:34.770
He was born here in Dallas
June 8th, 1949.

53:34.770 --> 53:36.540
Hey, that's very good.

53:36.540 --> 53:38.080
Any service record?

53:38.080 --> 53:39.440
Yeah.

53:39.440 --> 53:42.710
He joined the army in '69,
he made Green Berets,

53:42.710 --> 53:44.280
and his record
politely indicates

53:44.280 --> 53:45.880
that his bubble's off-center,

53:45.890 --> 53:48.180
so they discharged him
in December of '72.

53:48.190 --> 53:49.590
Anything after that?

53:49.590 --> 53:53.060
Yeah, he got
a pilot's license in '74

53:53.060 --> 53:54.760
and then he disappeared

53:54.760 --> 53:56.730
on a bush flight
in Columbia in '81.

53:56.730 --> 53:59.060
That picture was taken
in a Dallas strip joint.

53:59.060 --> 54:00.830
Mm, last August.

54:00.830 --> 54:03.470
That's how a Black Boy's
created, Laredo.

54:03.470 --> 54:04.600
What?

54:04.600 --> 54:06.740
Oh, it's a CIA term

54:06.740 --> 54:08.100
for men who don't exist.

54:08.110 --> 54:09.670
( phone rings )

54:12.380 --> 54:14.440
Walker.

54:14.450 --> 54:16.080
We'll be right there.

54:16.080 --> 54:19.220
It's Sweeney.
He has something for us.

54:19.220 --> 54:20.850
I'm gonna hang back here,
Walker.

54:20.850 --> 54:23.320
Read a little bit more
about this Mitchell guy.

54:23.320 --> 54:24.390
Okay.

54:37.340 --> 54:38.940
Oh, howdy.

54:38.940 --> 54:40.670
I'm sorry,
I thought Walker was here.

54:40.670 --> 54:43.910
Well, he's not, but why don't
you stick around?

54:43.910 --> 54:45.410
Sit a spell, huh?

54:45.410 --> 54:47.310
Are you sure?

54:48.550 --> 54:50.350
You seemed to be off
in a world of your own.

54:50.350 --> 54:53.580
( chuckling ):
Well, sorry about that.

54:53.590 --> 54:57.960
It's about 25 years or so ago,
but that's time way behind me.

54:57.960 --> 55:02.460
Yeah, I've been doing a lot
of thinking myself these days.

55:02.460 --> 55:04.230
About what?

55:04.230 --> 55:08.530
About what I would
have to leave behind

55:08.530 --> 55:12.270
if the decisions I make
in the next few hours or days

55:12.270 --> 55:13.600
go one way or another.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.370
You're worried
about leaving Walker behind.

55:15.370 --> 55:16.470
Isn't that it?

55:18.710 --> 55:23.310
I made a decision once
to leave somebody behind.

55:23.320 --> 55:27.320
I knew it was a mistake.

55:27.320 --> 55:29.350
But I argued myself into it.

55:29.350 --> 55:31.890
And I've paid for it ever since.

55:32.860 --> 55:34.790
Thanks, Laredo.

55:34.790 --> 55:38.300
Least I'll know what to do
when my arguments begin.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.100
You know, I've read
about wounds like these,

55:42.100 --> 55:43.470
but I've never
even seen 'em.

55:45.770 --> 55:47.140
( sighs )

55:47.140 --> 55:49.740
How 'bout the small
of the back? Any trauma there?

55:49.740 --> 55:51.740
Yeah, just as you thought,
caused by a knee.

55:51.740 --> 55:53.210
Let me show you.

55:55.110 --> 55:58.780
Left hand, arm around the throat
from behind with great force,

55:58.780 --> 56:00.380
knee driven into the kidney.

56:00.390 --> 56:02.790
Hit with the knife,
lumbar region,

56:02.790 --> 56:04.190
kidneys, upward angle.

56:04.190 --> 56:06.860
Now, body spasms backwards

56:06.860 --> 56:08.760
in reaction to the pain
of the injury,

56:08.760 --> 56:11.660
leaving the chest area open
for the final blow to the heart.

56:11.660 --> 56:14.100
Instantly fatal.
Correct, Walker?

56:14.100 --> 56:15.470
You got it.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.500
Sweeney?

56:17.500 --> 56:18.700
Yeah?

56:18.700 --> 56:20.300
How do you know
it was just like that?

56:20.310 --> 56:22.770
Well, the combination
of perfection and power

56:22.770 --> 56:24.570
with which the blows
were delivered,

56:24.580 --> 56:27.440
massive internal bleeding,
hardly any external,

56:27.450 --> 56:30.210
and the size and type
of the wounds caused by

56:30.220 --> 56:31.950
a weapon like this.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.950
A Sykes Fairbairn.

56:34.950 --> 56:36.320
It's a knife.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.990
It's the difference between
a lump of coal, Trivette,

56:38.990 --> 56:40.220
and a diamond.

56:40.230 --> 56:41.530
Correct, Walker.

56:41.530 --> 56:42.730
Designed in the '30s,

56:42.730 --> 56:44.560
still in use
by special ops teams.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.030
I use it to, uh,
open my letters.

56:47.030 --> 56:49.530
The, uh, man
you're looking for

56:49.540 --> 56:50.670
is the worst
kind of killer.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.240
Experienced, unemotional,

56:54.240 --> 56:55.810
detached.

56:55.810 --> 56:57.140
A trained professional.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.780
Contract man?

56:58.780 --> 57:01.280
Yeah, the worst kind.

57:02.850 --> 57:05.850
And I think I know
who the target is.

57:05.850 --> 57:07.180
( chuckles )

57:07.190 --> 57:10.150
I will not be intimidated,
certainly not by theories.

57:10.160 --> 57:11.590
Do you have any hard evidence

57:11.590 --> 57:14.360
supporting this assassination
idea of yours, Walker?

57:14.360 --> 57:16.390
Enough to urge caution, yes.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.730
What, based on a photograph?

57:17.730 --> 57:19.360
Based on the fact

57:19.360 --> 57:21.600
that he tried to kill me
and an ex-Texas Ranger.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.130
He's a professional assassin,
senator,

57:23.140 --> 57:25.070
and he's in town

57:25.070 --> 57:27.170
for a specific reason.

57:27.170 --> 57:30.870
You're worried about a repeat
of 1963, aren't you?

57:30.880 --> 57:32.380
I'm not worried,
senator,

57:32.380 --> 57:34.650
and you're not president yet.

57:34.650 --> 57:38.110
But you do have an advantage
that didn't exist in 1963.

57:38.120 --> 57:39.420
Really? What's that?

57:39.420 --> 57:42.090
You've been warned.

When we get back
to the office,

57:47.760 --> 57:49.630
I want you to fire up
that computer of yours.

57:49.630 --> 57:51.930
See if you can draw
a line from Tetrascope

57:51.930 --> 57:54.930
through Gant Industries
and Sidley International.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.370
From Haller to where?

57:57.370 --> 57:58.600
I'm not sure.

57:58.600 --> 58:01.600
Someone or some group
that makes decisions.

58:01.610 --> 58:02.770
What are you working on?

58:02.770 --> 58:03.940
A hunch.

58:03.940 --> 58:07.410
Professional assassins
cost a lot of money.

think you're doing?

58:30.740 --> 58:33.700
I'm borrowing your horse
to go ride with the fellas.

are they in?

58:37.040 --> 58:39.880
Relaxed.
Very relaxed.

Yeah, I can see that.

got a point there.

59:27.030 --> 59:29.930
You know, it is dangerous,
especially for us tenderfeet.

59:29.930 --> 59:31.900
That's not what I mean.
ROONEY: Walker.

59:31.900 --> 59:35.030
Uh, we did use a stepladder
to get up on these old horses.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.760
get those steaks started, huh?

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.460
You guys better hurry on up,
or there won't be nothing left.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.430
WALKER:
We'll be right there.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.930

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:17.230
( grunts )

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.370
Here, sit down.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.380
Oh, God.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.780
Oh, this pain,
it comes and it goes.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.350
What is it, Laredo?

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.080
( grunting )

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.350
Let me get you
to the hospital.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.450
No, I'm not going
to any hospital.

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:39.820
Uh-uh. I don't want
to lay on my back

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.590
in a hospital bed,
stupefied with morphine.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.900
No, sir.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.200
What do you mean?

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.000
Well, in that hospital,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.200
they told me
I was going to die.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.570
What?

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.510
Yeah. They said I had
some kind of a growth

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:58.240
in my stomach that they
couldn't get rid of.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.380
So they gave me
some chemotherapy,

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.410
but there's no dignity
in that, I'll tell ya.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.680
I walked away from it.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.580
Look, I don't
want those boys

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:10.390
to know anything
about this, okay?

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:11.890
I-I don't want their sympathy.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:13.360
I don't want
anybody's sympathy.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.430
Okay, I won't tell anybody.
All right.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.830
Tell me, why did you
come down here?

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:21.000
I've got some
unfinished business.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.100
Remember I was telling ya
about that Denver cop?

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.970
Well, I gotta wash
the blood off that badge.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:33.280
( grunts )

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.540
Can you make it?

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.380
Yeah.

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.820
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.340
GUARD: I'll handle this, Curtis.
No.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.440
You sure that's everything?

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.170
This is it.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.350
Rangers Walker,
Trivette and Boyd

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.520
to see Miles Douglas.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.050
Oh, and I trust
you have an appointment?

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.420
No.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.760
No.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.260
Well, just a moment.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.890
Mr. Chairman,

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.500
we have three Texas Rangers
out here to see you.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.030
Names again.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.570
I'm Walker,
he's Trivette--

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.600
The one doing the talking
is Walker,

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
and one of them, sir, is a--

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.140
Well, one of them's colored.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.970
( chuckles )

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.270
Did he say "colored"?

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.980
Well, I'll be danged,
I never even noticed.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.850
DOUGLAS:
<i> You must understand,</i>
<i> Ranger Walker,</i>

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.750
it's nothing
of a personal nature.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.710
If you had had a warrant,

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.980
it would have been a completely
different situation.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.750
I just find people
of certain ethnic groups

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.890
to be unacceptable.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.120
That includes Jews
and Catholics too, I imagine.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:58.730
Well, now, religion
is a different question.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:00.600
I mean, in some cases,
however, it's--

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.300
It's difficult
to make a distinction.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.170
Purification, selection.

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.500
These are really
historical facts.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.370
Well, I'm not here
to discuss history, Douglas.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.510
Take a cruise through this.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.180
I don't know what it is.
It's a road map.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:20.780
It leads from the chairman
of Douglas Consolidated--

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.020
You.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.350

in south Dallas,
where this came from.

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:31.090
But the one
I'm looking for

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.960
is on the barrel
of a rifle.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.530
And when I find it--
And I will.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.200

will be more than happy
to slap it on ya

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.940
just as hard as he can.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.780
Have a nice day.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:02.890
Curtis,

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:06.500
give Ranger Walker
a goodbye he won't forget.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.300
Yes, sir.
I understand.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.720

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.020

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:21.840
Well?

We oughta go
in there and help?

Naw, no. He can use
the relaxation.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.430

you rattled him good.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.900
Yeah, I did.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.170
Now, he's going to have to send
his Black Boys after me

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:55.970
before he goes after Knox.

Oh, I was very proud
and honored

to be having dinner
with the man

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:34.560
who may become the youngest
president since John Kennedy.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.930

was younger than both of us.

Alex, I need
to talk to you.

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.010
Two years ago,
I was close,

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.250
but now it's gonna happen.

01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:59.320
I mean, it has to happen.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.650
And things are very, uh...

01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:05.250
turbulent,
in motion, and...

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.620
I need a point of stability
in all this.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.590
I need you.

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:12.590
Help me change my life.

to make it full again.

I want you to be part of it.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.710
Excuse me, senator.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.780
I told you
not to interrupt.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.080
You have a call.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:38.090
It's important.
I think you should take it.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.260
Probably some
political thing.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.720
Think about what I said,
counselor,

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.230
and I'll expect
a conclusion

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.090
when I get back.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.710

Hi.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.380
Oh, just paperwork.

how I'm looking forward

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.280
to getting back
and how I miss you--

Yes, and I love you.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.960
We'll take some private time
for ourselves, you know?

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.930
Pine logs,
maybe some champagne, yeah?

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:17.890
Mm-hm.

how you want me

your life, Julian.

Alex,
that didn't mean any--

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.220
Listen, I can do things
for you.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:43.290
I can turn your life around.
I can make something of it.

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:45.420
I already made
something of it.

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:48.660
Alex.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:56.970
Anything I can
help you with, senator?

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:59.200
( elevator bell rings )

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:06.910
These three guys
you caught last night

01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:08.340
aren't very talkative,

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.310
but you didn't
expect that, did you?

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.750
No.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:12.920
And they didn't
have the rifle

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.620
with the Maxim silencer
on it either.

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.820
They got those weapons
stashed someplace.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.590
Yeah, could be
in their staging area,

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:20.060
if we could find it.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.390
Trivette, Walker, I think you
guys might want to see this.

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:24.960
Mesquite P.D. came up with
this John Doe last night.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.230
Their M.E. called
this morning.

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:28.300
Two puncture wounds,
heart, kidneys.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.270
They also ran over
that photo.

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:33.840
It's no John Doe,
Sweeney.

That wraps it up.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.810
It's over.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.080
It looks that way.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.300
Morning, Alex.

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.570
Hey, Alex.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:04.700
I'll wait--

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.500
I'll wait by the truck.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.680
So, uh...

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:19.720
How'd your dinner go
with the senator last night?

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:23.720
I think you know
how it went.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.360
Yeah.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.060
Look, I know you two
go back a long ways.

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:31.690
Are you okay?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.330
Yeah.

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:37.330
We had a conversation.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.900
A very enlightening
conversation.

tell you, Walker,

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.790
that's a damn good woman.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.260
Yeah, she is.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.630
Well?

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.630
Well, what?

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.900
It's not my place to sayin',

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.670
but what are you going to do,
just stand around and wait

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.970
till somebody comes along
that knows what to do about it?

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.640
Yeah, you're right.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.980
Yeah?

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.810
It's not your place.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:31.320
Let me get you
to a hospital.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.320
No. No.
No hospital.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.720
Why are you
so damn stubborn?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.630
( grunting )

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.170
Come on in, Walker.

01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.800
Sit down.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.320
You gonna be all right?

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.350
( sighs )

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:02.150
Yeah, I think so.

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:11.390
This the young Denver cop
you were talking about?

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.130
Who is he?

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.000
My son.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:25.810
And my only son.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.450
Well, boy,

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:30.850
it's finished.

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:36.220
The blood
has washed away and--

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.420
And the badge is clean.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.400
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.110
( sobbing )

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.380
Yeah, I know I should have
called you back sooner,

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:11.090
but I didn't know
what to say to you.

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:14.360
Well,
he's an interesting guy.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.360
Doesn't want
to stick around.

01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:22.630
Yeah, he just
does his thing and leaves.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.040
I don't need
that kind of thing again.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.270
Oh...

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.540
Jen, could I call you
right back in a few minutes?

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.210
Um, I just found something
that he left here.

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:36.550
Yeah, okay,
I'll call you right back.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.680

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.490
( door opens and closes )

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.330
Oh.

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:29.030
I know--
I know I shouldn't have,

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:30.530
but I just--

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.600
I thought--

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.800
You thought what?

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.740
You thought...

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.240
What did you think?
I just--

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.640
Bitch!
What did you think?

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.650
Name's Jessica Ann Pritchard.

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.250
She didn't show up
for work this morning.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.350
She had a deadline,

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.120
so her employer called
Fort Worth P.D.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.190
Jessica Ann Pritchard.
Why do I know that name?

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.600
You met her before.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.560
She was a computer
production artist.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.330
She worked for Marker and Bell,
that ad agency up from C.D.'s.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.700
Oh, that's right, she was
at C.D.'s reunion party.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:09.400
Any family?

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.710
Nobody in Dallas, uh--
Her parents are deceased.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:12.880
She's got one brother,

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.640
F.W.P.D.'s trying
to locate from Detroit.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.810
Married once, divorced,
no children.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.720
She came out here
from Grand Rapids two years ago.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.150
She have a record?

01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:23.890
Texas driver's license,
one minor moving violation.

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.450
City records,
one parking ticket.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.560
Both of 'em paid.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.490
She's only been dead
a few hours,

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.590
but the wounds are identical

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.130
to the ones that killed
your gunsmith.

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.190
And same type of weapon.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.460
Exactly the same?

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:36.300
I won't know till
I get her on the table,

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.870
but one thing I'm sure of,
it's the same killer.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.370
Is the Black Boy
still loose?

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.540
Two hours till
the competition.

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.180
You go cover Knox.

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:50.650
I'm going back to the office,
see if I can get a lead.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.550
Cordell. Cordell, where the hell
have you been?

01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:57.690
That competition's going
to start in an hour and a half.

01:19:57.690 --> 01:20:00.590
Hell, that's a dollar waiting
on a dime. Come on.

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:02.160
Yes,
I'm still waiting.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.890
Look, Cordell, I've got
some heavy money riding on you.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.160
C.D., I'm in the middle
of a murder investigation.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.330
One of your patrons--
Yes, Pritchard.

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.500
Jessica Ann.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.340
Jesse Pritchard?
She's dead?

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.110
Yeah, we found her body
this morning.

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.770
Well, she latched on
to that Kansas City cop

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.840
the night of the party.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.880
She left with him.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.010
What was his name?
B-Burke.

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:24.180
Burke? Ridley Burke?

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.280
Yeah.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.320
Hello. Never mind that.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.580
I want a priority call

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.890
to the Kansas City
Police Department.

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.090
Personnel records.

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:33.290
ASAP.

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:38.560
That ain't Burke.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.030
That's the real Burke.
Let's go.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.130
( indistinct chatter )

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:58.910
DODGE:
You did okay
in the qualifying, Burke,

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.580
but Walker's mighty good
under pressure.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.320
Now, you don't sound
very impartial for a judge.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.260
Aw, now, I wouldn't
take him too serious.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.120
He's just been here before.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.690
ROONEY:
Yeah, that's right.

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:13.360
We wish everybody
the same amount of luck.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.200
And some's got more
than others.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.370
Oh, I agree.

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:18.870
I agree.
I-I know all about luck.

to say about that?

about gun control, sir?

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:38.420

What about the environment?

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.860
Senator, I've been trying to get
through to you. Did Walker--?

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.760
Never mind, Ranger.
I'm here and I intend to stay.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.660
We missed one of the guys.
He could be anywhere.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.130

I have to stay.

if we went back to the ho--?

Hi, Walker.
I was just gonna call you.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.140
Yeah, I'm not gonna be there
for the shoot,

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.740
but I wish you
the best of luck.

a Black Boy out there.

C.D. and I are on our way
to the shootout.

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:22.990
Yeah, I got him.

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:27.930
The Denver cop's mother.

01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:29.030
Where is she, Laredo?

01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.300
Oh...

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.770
I'd, uh...

01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.670
( grunts )

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.350
Yeah, woman wouldn't
have me.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.980
But I loved 'em
all the more...

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:52.820
for the good sense
she showed.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.230
Oh, she was a poet.

01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:01.930
Oh, yeah.

01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:04.800
I heard some pretty things
come from her.

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.170
Yeah.

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:09.770
I didn't get a chance

01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:11.570
to say goodbye

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:15.040
to either one of them, but--

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.010
But I'll see 'em both...

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.980
out across the meadows...

01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:25.790
where the bluebonnets bloom.

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:30.190
( panting )

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.470
We're gonna miss you,
Laredo.

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:50.010
( sirens wailing )

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060
(<i> piano playing</i>
<i> sentimental theme</i> )

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.850
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )
