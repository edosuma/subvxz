01:18.869 --> 01:20.803
<i>U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.</i>

01:20.803 --> 01:23.737
<i>Starfleet Base, we have sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?</i>

01:23.737 --> 01:25.239
<i>Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?</i>

01:25.239 --> 01:28.209
<i>Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.</i>

01:28.209 --> 01:29.539
<i>It looks like a lightning storm.</i>

01:29.539 --> 01:31.079
<i>What you have sent us
doesn't seem possible.</i>

01:31.314 --> 01:33.441
<i>Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.</i>

01:34.117 --> 01:35.607
- Report.
- It's still out of visual range.

01:35.607 --> 01:37.550
- Give me 20 seconds.
- Alert Captain Robau....

01:37.550 --> 01:40.817
that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.

01:40.817 --> 01:42.289
Polarize the viewscreen.

01:42.289 --> 01:43.825
<i>Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?</i>

01:43.825 --> 01:45.258
Captain, we have visual.

01:45.258 --> 01:48.354
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
<i>- Negative, Lieutenant.</i>

01:48.354 --> 01:49.898
<i>You're 75,000 kilometers from...</i>

01:49.898 --> 01:51.865
Captain, are you seeing this?

01:54.504 --> 01:55.528
My God...

02:16.660 --> 02:17.957
I have a reading.

02:17.957 --> 02:19.926
- They have locked weapons on us.
- Red alert.

02:19.926 --> 02:22.089
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees...

02:22.089 --> 02:23.222
...mark 2.
- Arm weapons.

02:25.702 --> 02:26.964
Evasive pattern Delta-five.

02:29.005 --> 02:30.165
Incoming fast.

02:36.513 --> 02:39.175
Fire all phasers. Damage report.

02:39.175 --> 02:42.445
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like it.

02:43.553 --> 02:45.646
Weapons are off-line.
Main power 38%.

02:45.646 --> 02:47.620
- They're firing another.
- All power to forward shields.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.898
Lieutenant.

03:03.006 --> 03:04.667
Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.742
- Were our shields even up?
- Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

03:06.742 --> 03:08.743
- We have confirmed casualties, sir.
- Shields 11% and dropping.

03:08.743 --> 03:10.312
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

03:10.312 --> 03:14.782
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.046
<i>Hello.</i>

03:19.255 --> 03:21.951
<i>My commander requests
the presence of your Captain...</i>

03:21.951 --> 03:24.390
<i>...in order to negotiate a cease-fire.</i>

03:24.390 --> 03:27.429
<i>You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.</i>

03:27.429 --> 03:30.158
<i>Your refusal would be unwise.</i>

03:42.846 --> 03:44.279
Walk with me.

03:50.286 --> 03:53.517
If I don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

03:53.517 --> 03:56.319
- Sir, we could issue--
- There is no help for us out here.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.859
Use autopilot.

03:59.229 --> 04:01.561
- And get off this ship.
- Aye, Captain.

04:01.561 --> 04:03.859
You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk.

05:16.973 --> 05:18.964
His heart rate's elevated.

05:41.364 --> 05:43.025
Look at this ship.

05:44.801 --> 05:48.430
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

05:49.506 --> 05:52.669
- Is it him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

05:52.669 --> 05:57.405
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

06:10.894 --> 06:13.863
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

06:17.167 --> 06:19.727
I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

06:21.404 --> 06:24.134
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

06:26.376 --> 06:28.936
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.509
Where are you from?

06:40.023 --> 06:41.854
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again.

06:41.854 --> 06:43.948
Bravo-six maneuver. Fire full spread.

06:53.403 --> 06:56.566
- Seventeen more out.
- I am initiating General Order 13.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.402
- We're evacuating.
- Yes, sir.

07:03.546 --> 07:06.947
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

07:06.947 --> 07:08.984
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

07:08.984 --> 07:10.882
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

07:10.882 --> 07:12.420
You will deliver in the shuttle. Go.

07:18.328 --> 07:22.025
Move. This one's closed.
Let's go. Get him up.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.592
I am on my way.

07:25.568 --> 07:26.967
- George.
<i>- You're okay. Thank God.</i>

07:26.967 --> 07:30.072
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

07:30.406 --> 07:31.998
- Yes.
<i>- Everything's going to be okay.</i>

07:31.998 --> 07:36.169
<i>- Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.</i>
- George, it's coming.

07:36.169 --> 07:39.442
- Our baby, it's coming now.
<i>- I am on my way.</i>

07:45.488 --> 07:50.016
<i>Autopilot function has been destroyed.
Manual operation only.</i>

07:51.094 --> 07:53.585
Clear those decks now.
Get to the shuttles. Move.

07:53.585 --> 07:56.893
Move, move. Get to the hangar deck.
Get to the hangar deck. Let's move it.

07:58.701 --> 08:01.295
- That was a big one.
- Just keep breathing. You will be fine.

08:01.295 --> 08:04.168
- And the baby, too, right?
- And the baby, too.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.777
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

08:16.052 --> 08:18.486
<i>Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?</i>

08:18.486 --> 08:21.216
- Yes, sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

08:21.216 --> 08:23.884
- We're waiting on you, sir.
<i>- No, just go.</i> Take off immediately.

08:24.327 --> 08:26.192
<i>- That's an order.</i>
- Yes, sir.

08:26.429 --> 08:28.090
No, wait. We can't go yet.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.491
Please stop. Stop.

08:34.937 --> 08:38.236
<i>George?</i> The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

08:38.640 --> 08:39.869
Sweetheart, listen to me.

08:40.777 --> 08:42.607
<i>I am not going to be there.</i>

08:42.607 --> 08:44.872
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.609
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here.

08:47.609 --> 08:49.810
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

08:49.810 --> 08:52.945
George, I can't do this without you.

08:52.945 --> 08:55.422
Okay, I need you to push now.

10:13.002 --> 10:14.594
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

10:14.971 --> 10:16.165
A boy?

10:17.607 --> 10:18.904
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

10:19.876 --> 10:21.537
<i>He's beautiful.</i>

10:23.613 --> 10:25.205
George, you should be here.

10:26.883 --> 10:28.316
<i>Impact alert.</i>

10:30.453 --> 10:33.945
- What are we going to call him?
- We can name him after your father.

10:34.424 --> 10:37.450
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

10:39.362 --> 10:42.354
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.867
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.774
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?
- I hear you.

10:54.774 --> 10:58.506
I love you so much.
I love you...

12:16.893 --> 12:18.827
<i>Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.</i>

12:18.827 --> 12:21.488
<i>You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet?</i>

12:21.488 --> 12:23.963
<i>You get your ass back home now.</i>

12:23.963 --> 12:25.407
<i>You live in my house, buddy.</i>

12:25.407 --> 12:27.695
<i>You live in my house,
and that's my car.</i>

12:27.695 --> 12:30.670
<i>You get one scratch on that car,
and I am going to whip your--</i>

12:43.953 --> 12:45.386
Yeah.

12:54.964 --> 12:56.295
Hey, Johnny!

13:16.485 --> 13:18.544
Citizen. Pull over.

13:45.214 --> 13:46.964
No...

14:13.009 --> 14:15.136
Is there a problem, Officer?

14:15.711 --> 14:17.804
Citizen, what is your name?

14:18.347 --> 14:20.577
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

14:38.968 --> 14:41.528
<i>What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?</i>

14:41.528 --> 14:44.231
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.607
One-point-two-six.

14:45.607 --> 14:46.697
An ellipse.

14:46.697 --> 14:48.606
<i>What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?</i>

14:48.606 --> 14:50.541
Positive two-thirds.

14:50.541 --> 14:55.481
<i>What is the square root of 2,396,324?</i>

14:55.481 --> 14:57.449
- 1,548.
<i>- What is the dimensionality...</i>

14:57.449 --> 15:00.249
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

15:00.249 --> 15:04.087
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

15:04.087 --> 15:07.856
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.160
Spock.

15:14.336 --> 15:17.328
I presume you have prepared
new insults for today.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.105
Affirmative.

15:27.316 --> 15:30.945
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

15:30.945 --> 15:34.045
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and therefore
have no place in this universe. Look.

15:34.045 --> 15:37.023
He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

15:37.023 --> 15:40.618
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

15:42.231 --> 15:47.328
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

16:15.998 --> 16:17.989
They called you a traitor.

16:22.805 --> 16:25.205
Emotions run deep within our race.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.742
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

16:28.742 --> 16:32.371
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

16:32.882 --> 16:37.581
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

16:40.756 --> 16:43.884
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan...

16:44.527 --> 16:46.586
...and yet, you married a human.

16:46.586 --> 16:48.822
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty...

16:48.822 --> 16:51.627
...to observe and understand human behavior.

16:52.234 --> 16:56.766
Marrying your mother was... logical.

16:59.308 --> 17:04.143
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

17:05.513 --> 17:10.315
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

17:11.820 --> 17:14.449
This is something only you can decide.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.724
Spock, come here, let me see you.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.402
- No.
- Spock.

17:35.311 --> 17:39.611
There's no need to be anxious.
You will do fine.

17:39.915 --> 17:42.076
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

17:42.076 --> 17:45.915
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

17:46.822 --> 17:47.880
Okay.

17:55.598 --> 17:58.761
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

18:01.503 --> 18:05.303
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr...

18:05.941 --> 18:07.841
...and purge all emotion...

18:09.912 --> 18:13.211
...I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

18:16.285 --> 18:17.547
Spock.

18:19.955 --> 18:23.356
As always, whatever you choose to be...

18:24.426 --> 18:26.656
...you will have a proud mother.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.102
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

18:35.102 --> 18:39.071
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

18:39.508 --> 18:43.205
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.678
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

18:45.678 --> 18:47.806
Logical, but unnecessary.

18:47.806 --> 18:50.977
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

18:50.977 --> 18:52.553
It is truly remarkable, Spock...

18:52.553 --> 18:55.954
...that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

18:56.692 --> 18:57.954
All rise.

19:01.730 --> 19:04.028
If you would clarify, Minister...

19:04.967 --> 19:08.425
...to what disadvantage are you referring?
- Your human mother.

19:13.742 --> 19:16.711
Council. Ministers, I must decline.

19:16.711 --> 19:19.508
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

19:19.508 --> 19:22.311
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

19:22.311 --> 19:26.115
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

19:26.115 --> 19:28.519
Why did you come
before this council today?

19:28.519 --> 19:31.149
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

19:31.149 --> 19:34.320
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

19:35.364 --> 19:38.925
Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.667
Live long and prosper.

19:58.654 --> 19:59.882
- How are you?
- Hey.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:11.433 --> 20:16.962
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics...

20:16.962 --> 20:20.974
...two Cardassian Sunrises and...
- Got to try the Slusho. It's good.

20:20.974 --> 20:22.668
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

20:22.668 --> 20:25.440
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

20:27.016 --> 20:29.644
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

20:29.644 --> 20:31.947
Her shot's on her.
Thanks but no thanks.

20:31.947 --> 20:35.379
Don't you want to at least know my name
before you completely reject me?

20:35.379 --> 20:38.517
- I am fine without it.
- You are fine without it.

20:38.927 --> 20:40.758
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

20:42.598 --> 20:46.193
If you don't tell me your name,
I am going to have to make one up.

20:46.568 --> 20:48.695
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

20:48.695 --> 20:51.272
That's the name
I was going to make up for you.

20:51.272 --> 20:53.705
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

20:53.705 --> 20:55.401
They don't have last names
in your world?

20:55.401 --> 20:56.876
Uhura is my last name.

20:56.876 --> 21:00.142
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

21:01.784 --> 21:02.876
Excuse me, buddy.

21:02.876 --> 21:06.045
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

21:06.045 --> 21:08.623
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

21:08.623 --> 21:13.423
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

21:14.196 --> 21:16.824
It means you have got a talented tongue.

21:17.199 --> 21:18.860
I am impressed.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.958
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick...

21:20.958 --> 21:25.973
...who only has sex with farm animals.
- Well, not only.

21:27.342 --> 21:29.537
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

21:29.537 --> 21:32.170
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

21:32.170 --> 21:34.272
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

21:34.272 --> 21:38.649
- Hey, you better mind your manners.
- Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

21:38.649 --> 21:43.418
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

21:43.418 --> 21:47.086
So get some more guys,
and then it will be an even fight.

21:50.299 --> 21:51.891
Guys, stop it.

21:54.470 --> 21:55.698
Stop it.

22:17.359 --> 22:18.451
Enough.

22:26.235 --> 22:27.532
Guys, he's had enough.

22:32.975 --> 22:34.772
Outside, all of you.

22:35.711 --> 22:37.269
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

22:37.813 --> 22:39.474
- He wouldn't even listen.
- I just bought a drink.

22:39.474 --> 22:41.446
- Can you believe this?
- It's not really fair.

22:41.446 --> 22:44.110
- Come on.
- You all right, son?

22:44.110 --> 22:47.052
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

22:48.157 --> 22:50.557
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

22:50.557 --> 22:53.719
- And who am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

22:57.266 --> 22:58.893
Can I get another one?

22:58.893 --> 23:01.731
For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.

23:01.731 --> 23:05.967
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.541
He sure learned his lesson.

23:07.743 --> 23:09.233
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

23:09.233 --> 23:11.574
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

23:11.574 --> 23:14.706
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

23:14.706 --> 23:17.114
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

23:17.114 --> 23:20.120
- Why are you talking to me, man?
- Because I looked up your file

23:20.120 --> 23:22.816
while you were drooling on the floor.

23:22.816 --> 23:26.656
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

23:26.656 --> 23:29.560
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

23:29.560 --> 23:31.360
Maybe I love it.

23:31.360 --> 23:35.163
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.762
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

23:39.141 --> 23:40.802
Something special?

23:42.878 --> 23:45.142
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

23:46.915 --> 23:49.281
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

23:49.281 --> 23:53.582
If you're half the man your father was, Jim,
Starfleet could use you.

23:54.122 --> 23:58.559
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

23:59.294 --> 24:02.263
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

24:02.263 --> 24:04.298
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada--

24:04.298 --> 24:07.300
- Are we done?
- I am done.

24:12.374 --> 24:16.401
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

24:20.382 --> 24:24.011
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

24:24.553 --> 24:29.286
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

24:30.559 --> 24:32.493
I dare you to do better.

25:57.479 --> 25:58.878
Nice ride, man.

26:02.684 --> 26:04.083
It's yours.

26:04.786 --> 26:07.414
Four years? I will do it in three.

26:23.138 --> 26:24.867
At ease, gentlemen.

26:43.625 --> 26:47.061
- Never did get that first name.
- You need a doctor.

26:47.061 --> 26:49.589
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor.

26:49.589 --> 26:50.387
You need to get back to your seat.

26:50.387 --> 26:51.257
I had one in the bathroom....

26:51.257 --> 26:53.759
...with no windows. - You need to get back
to your seat now. - I suffer from aviaphobia.

26:53.759 --> 26:55.336
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

26:55.336 --> 26:59.533
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I will make you sit down.

27:01.676 --> 27:04.076
- Fine.
- Thank you.

27:04.846 --> 27:08.179
<i>This is Captain Pike.
We have been cleared for takeoff.</i>

27:08.483 --> 27:12.449
- I may throw up on you.
- I think these things are pretty safe.

27:12.449 --> 27:14.920
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

27:14.920 --> 27:17.321
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

27:17.321 --> 27:20.259
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

27:20.259 --> 27:23.297
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

27:23.297 --> 27:26.697
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

27:26.697 --> 27:30.363
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

27:30.363 --> 27:34.272
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

27:34.272 --> 27:36.435
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

27:36.435 --> 27:39.878
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

27:39.878 --> 27:42.040
All I got left is my bones.

27:47.489 --> 27:51.289
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

28:38.607 --> 28:42.270
Captain Nero. You have been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

28:42.270 --> 28:44.174
Ayel says it's time.

28:49.317 --> 28:54.619
Sir, we have arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

28:54.619 --> 28:56.987
- What are your orders?
- We wait.

28:57.792 --> 29:01.455
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

29:01.455 --> 29:03.929
as we have been doing for 25 years.

29:05.233 --> 29:07.997
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

29:08.436 --> 29:11.963
I am not going to kill him.
I am going to make him watch.

29:26.421 --> 29:27.752
Capture that ship.

29:29.424 --> 29:31.153
Welcome back, Spock.

29:35.263 --> 29:36.457
Why are you so happy?

29:36.457 --> 29:38.897
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, I don't suppose you do.

29:38.897 --> 29:40.490
Hello, ladies.

29:41.102 --> 29:42.729
- I am taking the test again.
- You got to be kidding.

29:42.729 --> 29:44.566
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

29:44.566 --> 29:45.833
You know, I have got better things to do...

29:45.833 --> 29:48.000
...than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.508
I am a doctor, Jim. I am busy.

29:49.508 --> 29:51.875
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

29:51.875 --> 29:54.642
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

29:54.642 --> 29:57.809
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

29:57.809 --> 29:59.386
I got to study.

30:00.155 --> 30:01.747
Study, my ass.

30:05.026 --> 30:09.486
- Jim, I think I love you.
- That is so weird.

30:10.165 --> 30:11.860
- Lights.
- Lights on.

30:12.734 --> 30:14.224
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

30:14.224 --> 30:16.395
- Yeah, I did, but...
- You don't love me, too?

30:16.395 --> 30:17.835
Oh, my God, my roommate.

30:17.835 --> 30:19.133
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

30:19.133 --> 30:21.071
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

30:21.071 --> 30:24.538
- Under... - Look, just get under the bed.
- Come on. - She can't see you here.

30:24.538 --> 30:26.045
- Why not?
- Because I promised her...

30:26.045 --> 30:27.375
...I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
- Really?

30:27.375 --> 30:30.178
- Well, how many guys have you...
- Just down. Just down.

30:32.487 --> 30:33.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:33.511 --> 30:35.055
- How are you?
- Good.

30:35.055 --> 30:38.216
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

30:38.216 --> 30:40.089
Yeah, I thought all night.

30:40.089 --> 30:44.564
I was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

30:44.564 --> 30:48.295
- Really?
- Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

30:48.837 --> 30:49.929
- No.
- Yeah.

30:49.929 --> 30:52.563
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

30:52.563 --> 30:55.643
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

30:59.681 --> 31:01.308
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

31:01.308 --> 31:03.714
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

31:03.714 --> 31:05.342
You could hear me breathing?

31:05.342 --> 31:06.977
- You.
- Big day tomorrow.

31:06.977 --> 31:09.784
- You're going to fail. Get out.
- Gaila, see you around.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.324
If I pass,
will you tell me your first name?

31:11.324 --> 31:13.155
- No. Good night.
- I think the fact...

31:13.155 --> 31:16.025
...that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

31:17.999 --> 31:21.298
We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.

31:21.298 --> 31:23.371
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

31:23.371 --> 31:25.336
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

31:25.336 --> 31:28.466
"Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,"...

31:29.711 --> 31:30.939
..."Captain."

31:31.913 --> 31:33.744
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone...

31:33.744 --> 31:36.612
...and are locking weapons on us.
- That's okay.

31:36.985 --> 31:39.419
- That's okay?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

31:39.821 --> 31:43.854
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?
Is he not taking the simulation seriously?

31:44.192 --> 31:47.093
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

31:47.093 --> 31:49.789
- I don't suppose this is a problem either.
- They're firing, Captain.

31:50.231 --> 31:54.093
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members from the damaged ship.

31:54.093 --> 31:55.931
And how do you expect us
to rescue them...

31:55.931 --> 31:58.733
...when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

31:58.733 --> 32:00.307
Alert Medical.

32:02.644 --> 32:05.135
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

32:05.135 --> 32:08.882
- I understand.
- Well, should we, I don't know, fire back?

32:09.150 --> 32:10.981
- No.
- Of course not.

32:18.359 --> 32:20.554
What is this? What's going on?

32:24.165 --> 32:26.395
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

32:26.395 --> 32:28.662
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

32:28.662 --> 32:29.998
Are they?

32:31.740 --> 32:33.401
No. They're not.

32:33.975 --> 32:35.499
Fire on all enemy ships.

32:35.499 --> 32:38.238
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

32:38.238 --> 32:41.247
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

32:46.387 --> 32:48.787
- All ships destroyed, Captain.
- Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

32:48.787 --> 32:52.553
So. We have managed to eliminate
all enemy ships...

32:52.553 --> 32:54.252
...no one onboard was injured...

32:54.252 --> 32:59.732
...and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.

33:04.272 --> 33:07.070
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

33:09.778 --> 33:11.245
I do not know.

33:12.347 --> 33:15.475
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

33:15.884 --> 33:17.977
James T. Kirk, step forward.

33:19.888 --> 33:22.652
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

33:22.652 --> 33:25.487
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

33:25.487 --> 33:29.051
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

33:30.198 --> 33:33.634
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

33:34.469 --> 33:38.235
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

33:42.343 --> 33:44.402
Step forward, please.

33:44.402 --> 33:48.642
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

33:48.642 --> 33:52.709
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

33:54.455 --> 33:57.447
- Commander?
- Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed...

33:57.447 --> 33:59.925
...to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

33:59.925 --> 34:02.895
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

34:03.698 --> 34:07.225
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular, you cheated.

34:09.070 --> 34:12.801
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

34:13.408 --> 34:15.842
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

34:15.842 --> 34:17.844
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

34:17.844 --> 34:20.505
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

34:20.505 --> 34:24.176
- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
- Then not only did you violate the rules...

34:24.176 --> 34:26.253
...you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

34:26.253 --> 34:27.844
Please, enlighten me.

34:27.844 --> 34:30.150
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

34:30.150 --> 34:32.418
a captain cannot cheat death.

34:35.630 --> 34:36.858
I of all people?

34:36.858 --> 34:40.264
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel...

34:40.264 --> 34:42.029
...before being killed in action, did he not?

34:42.029 --> 34:43.899
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

34:43.899 --> 34:46.132
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

34:46.132 --> 34:49.733
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose is to experience fear...

34:50.645 --> 34:52.612
...fear in the face of certain death.

34:52.612 --> 34:56.844
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.352
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

35:03.091 --> 35:04.388
Excuse me, sir.

35:10.965 --> 35:13.490
We have received a distress call
from Vulcan.

35:13.490 --> 35:16.661
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system...

35:16.661 --> 35:21.174
...I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

35:27.649 --> 35:31.710
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I don't know, but I like him.

35:36.024 --> 35:39.221
Fugeman, Regula One.
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.592
McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise.
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott.

35:42.592 --> 35:46.189
Rader, U.S.S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.

35:48.503 --> 35:50.528
He didn't call my name.

35:51.272 --> 35:55.936
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

35:56.210 --> 35:57.575
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

35:57.575 --> 36:00.546
That means you're grounded until the
Academy Board rules. All right, listen up.

36:00.546 --> 36:03.412
I am going to read this list one time,
and one time only.

36:04.285 --> 36:08.346
Jim, the Board will rule in your favor.
Most likely.

36:10.158 --> 36:13.616
- Look, Jim, I got to go.
- Yeah.

36:13.928 --> 36:15.828
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

36:23.404 --> 36:25.599
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

36:30.511 --> 36:31.705
Damn it.

36:34.415 --> 36:37.782
- Come with me.
- U.S.S. Newton. Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut.

36:37.782 --> 36:41.616
Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares.
Go to your stations and good luck.

36:45.093 --> 36:47.789
- Bones, where are we going?
- You will see.

36:50.064 --> 36:51.622
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

36:51.622 --> 36:54.099
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

36:54.099 --> 36:56.329
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate...

36:56.329 --> 36:59.565
...an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

36:59.565 --> 37:01.938
..."an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies...

37:01.938 --> 37:05.410
...in subspace transmissions tests"?
- Consistently, yes.

37:05.410 --> 37:07.481
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire...

37:07.481 --> 37:10.608
...is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,
I am assigned to the Farragut?

37:10.608 --> 37:13.880
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.456
No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.

37:20.695 --> 37:22.754
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

37:23.765 --> 37:25.926
- What are you doing?
- I am doing you a favor.

37:25.926 --> 37:27.661
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

37:27.661 --> 37:31.034
Take a seat. I am going to give you
a vaccine against viral infection...

37:31.034 --> 37:34.973
...from Melvaran mud fleas.
- What for?

37:34.973 --> 37:37.271
- To give you the symptoms.
- What are you talking about?

37:37.271 --> 37:39.608
You're going to start to lose vision
in your left eye.

37:39.608 --> 37:40.874
Yeah, I already have.

37:40.874 --> 37:43.677
Oh, and you're going to get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

37:43.677 --> 37:45.912
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah. You owe me one.

37:48.289 --> 37:52.885
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

37:52.885 --> 37:54.484
Medical code states the treatment...

37:54.484 --> 37:56.586
...and transport of a patient is
to be determined...

37:56.586 --> 37:59.757
...at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

37:59.757 --> 38:01.732
So I am taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

38:01.732 --> 38:04.202
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike...

38:04.202 --> 38:06.136
...why the Enterprise
warped into a crisis...

38:06.136 --> 38:09.073
...without one of its senior
medical officers?

38:09.073 --> 38:12.635
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

38:30.498 --> 38:34.229
- I might throw up on you.
- Jim, you have got to look at this.

38:35.336 --> 38:36.598
- Jim, look.
- What?

38:36.598 --> 38:37.671
Look.

39:34.061 --> 39:38.327
- We need to get you changed.
- I don't feel right. I feel like I am leaking.

39:38.327 --> 39:41.094
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

39:58.085 --> 40:00.815
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.924
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

40:03.924 --> 40:06.323
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship...

40:06.323 --> 40:09.828
...deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

40:09.828 --> 40:13.833
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

40:14.835 --> 40:17.099
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

40:17.099 --> 40:18.502
Helm, thrusters.

40:18.502 --> 40:20.938
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

40:20.938 --> 40:23.203
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

40:33.087 --> 40:36.284
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

40:36.284 --> 40:40.451
- Set a course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

40:41.729 --> 40:44.163
Maximum warp. Punch it.

41:01.182 --> 41:02.979
Lieutenant, where is Helmsman McKenna?

41:02.979 --> 41:06.144
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

41:06.144 --> 41:07.721
I am Hikaru Sulu.

41:07.721 --> 41:11.155
- And you are a pilot, right?
- Very much so, sir.

41:11.155 --> 41:14.626
I am not sure what's wrong here.

41:14.626 --> 41:18.665
- Is the parking brake on?
- No. I will figure it out. I am just...

41:18.665 --> 41:22.031
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

41:26.040 --> 41:28.133
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

41:35.716 --> 41:37.206
- Where are we?
- Medical Bay.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.149
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

41:39.149 --> 41:40.948
- Hi. How are you?
- Come here.

41:40.948 --> 41:44.582
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

41:44.582 --> 41:47.786
- I am going to give you a mild sedative.
- I wish I didn't know you.

41:47.786 --> 41:49.692
Don't be such an infant.

41:51.098 --> 41:52.656
How long is it supposed to...

41:53.334 --> 41:54.699
Unbelievable.

41:56.137 --> 41:58.503
- Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
- Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

41:58.503 --> 42:02.406
- Chanko? Cherpov?
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

42:02.406 --> 42:06.037
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

42:06.037 --> 42:07.842
Yes, sir. Happy to.

42:08.649 --> 42:12.380
Ensign authorization code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

42:12.380 --> 42:14.454
<i>Authorization not recognized.</i>

42:14.454 --> 42:21.090
Ensign authorization code
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

42:23.564 --> 42:25.964
May I have your attention, please?

42:26.801 --> 42:32.000
<i>At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.</i>

42:32.306 --> 42:35.571
<i>What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.</i>

42:35.976 --> 42:40.606
<i>Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command...</i>

42:40.848 --> 42:44.340
<i>...that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.</i>

42:44.885 --> 42:48.651
<i>Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan...</i>

42:48.651 --> 42:52.021
<i>...and assist in evacuations if necessary.</i>

42:52.626 --> 42:57.325
<i>We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.</i>

42:58.966 --> 43:03.699
- Lightning storm.
- Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

43:05.106 --> 43:07.336
- Good God, man.
- What?

43:09.610 --> 43:12.511
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine, damn it.

43:12.511 --> 43:14.774
Nurse Chapel, I need 50 cc's of cortisone.

43:15.216 --> 43:16.581
Yes, sir.

43:18.853 --> 43:21.386
<i>...appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.</i>

43:21.386 --> 43:23.984
- Hey.
- We got to stop the ship.

43:24.558 --> 43:28.255
Jim. I am not kidding.
We need to keep your heart rate down.

43:28.562 --> 43:29.961
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

43:29.961 --> 43:32.191
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

43:32.191 --> 43:35.427
- We're flying into a trap.
- Damn it, Jim, stand still.

43:36.904 --> 43:38.303
Stop it.

43:47.114 --> 43:48.945
- Uhura. Uhura...
- Kirk. What are you doing here?

43:48.945 --> 43:50.983
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

43:50.983 --> 43:53.019
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

43:53.019 --> 43:55.054
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

43:55.054 --> 43:56.646
- What?
- And was the ship...

43:56.646 --> 43:57.815
Was the ship what?

43:57.815 --> 44:00.325
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

44:00.325 --> 44:02.396
- Numb tongue?
- I can fix that.

44:02.396 --> 44:06.329
- Was the ship what? - Romulan.
- What? I... - Romulan.

44:06.329 --> 44:08.965
- Romulan? - Yeah.
- Yes. - Yes?

44:09.665 --> 44:10.636
Damn it.

44:43.938 --> 44:47.203
Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.

44:49.443 --> 44:50.501
- Jim.
- What's going on?

44:50.501 --> 44:51.635
- Jim, come back.
- Kirk.

44:51.635 --> 44:53.542
- Captain. Captain Pike, sir...
- Jim, come back here.

44:53.542 --> 44:55.080
...we have to stop the ship.
- Kirk, how the hell...

44:55.080 --> 44:56.706
...did you get onboard the Enterprise?

44:56.706 --> 44:58.546
Captain, this man's under the influence of...

44:58.546 --> 45:00.142
...a severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, please...

45:00.142 --> 45:01.949
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.489
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

45:03.489 --> 45:04.922
It's being attacked by Romulans.

45:04.922 --> 45:08.358
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've had
enough attention for one day.

45:08.358 --> 45:09.759
McCoy, take him back to medical.

45:09.759 --> 45:11.422
- We will have words later.
- Aye, Captain.

45:11.422 --> 45:12.999
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

45:12.999 --> 45:14.829
Mr. Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

45:14.829 --> 45:16.197
- I get it. You're a great arguer.
- By Regulations...

45:16.197 --> 45:17.998
- I'd love to do it again.
- ...that makes him a stowaway.

45:17.998 --> 45:19.367
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

45:19.367 --> 45:20.963
- Kirk...
- This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

45:20.963 --> 45:24.044
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

45:24.044 --> 45:25.805
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

45:25.805 --> 45:27.642
Based on what facts?

45:29.617 --> 45:32.484
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today...

45:32.484 --> 45:34.520
...also occurred on the day of my birth...

45:34.520 --> 45:37.455
...before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

45:37.455 --> 45:39.583
You know that, sir,
I read your dissertation.

45:39.583 --> 45:42.287
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry...

45:42.287 --> 45:44.091
...was never seen or heard from again.

45:44.091 --> 45:46.166
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space...

45:46.166 --> 45:49.031
...and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

45:49.031 --> 45:52.570
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir...

45:52.570 --> 45:55.972
...and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

45:55.972 --> 45:58.874
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

46:01.248 --> 46:04.581
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

46:04.885 --> 46:07.319
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

46:07.319 --> 46:10.481
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

46:11.292 --> 46:13.419
The cadet's logic is sound.

46:13.994 --> 46:15.985
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

46:15.985 --> 46:17.961
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

46:17.961 --> 46:21.000
Scan Vulcan space.
Check for any transmissions in Romulan.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.434
Sir, I am not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

46:24.434 --> 46:26.506
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

46:26.506 --> 46:28.165
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

46:28.165 --> 46:31.335
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

46:31.645 --> 46:33.135
Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

46:33.135 --> 46:35.715
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan...

46:35.715 --> 46:38.011
...but we seem to have lost all contact.

46:38.011 --> 46:40.814
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission...

46:40.814 --> 46:45.358
...or transmission of any kind in the area.
- It's because they're being attacked.

46:49.229 --> 46:51.062
Shields up. Red alert.

46:53.100 --> 46:55.068
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

46:55.769 --> 46:58.567
Four, three, two...

47:00.374 --> 47:02.773
- Emergency evasive.
- On it, sir.

47:10.451 --> 47:12.043
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

47:12.043 --> 47:14.211
All stations.
Engineer Olson, report.

47:24.398 --> 47:26.127
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

47:26.127 --> 47:27.700
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

47:46.954 --> 47:48.979
Sir, there's another Federation ship.

47:48.979 --> 47:51.148
- Destroy it, too.
- Fire torpedoes!

47:51.148 --> 47:52.452
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

47:52.452 --> 47:54.993
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

48:02.870 --> 48:05.361
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

48:05.361 --> 48:07.872
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

48:07.872 --> 48:09.033
Get me Starfleet Command.

48:09.033 --> 48:12.271
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device...

48:12.271 --> 48:13.607
...into the Vulcan atmosphere.

48:13.607 --> 48:15.238
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications...

48:15.238 --> 48:17.442
...and transporter abilities.
- All power to forward shields.

48:17.442 --> 48:18.916
Prepare to fire all weapons.

48:23.557 --> 48:26.082
- Weapons ready.
- Wait.

48:26.593 --> 48:29.153
- The hull. Magnify.
- Yes, sir.

48:34.101 --> 48:36.194
Captain, we're being hailed.

48:37.271 --> 48:38.431
<i>Hello.</i>

48:40.374 --> 48:43.241
I am Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

48:43.241 --> 48:45.402
<i>Hi, Christopher. I am Nero.</i>

48:45.402 --> 48:47.343
You have declared war
against the Federation.

48:47.343 --> 48:50.508
Withdraw, I will agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership...

48:50.508 --> 48:53.916
...at a neutral location.
<i>- I do not speak for the Empire.</i>

48:53.916 --> 48:55.511
<i>We stand apart.</i>

48:57.057 --> 49:00.788
<i>As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?</i>

49:03.530 --> 49:06.260
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

49:06.260 --> 49:09.062
<i>No, we're not. Not yet.</i>

49:10.104 --> 49:13.301
<i>Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.</i>

49:14.842 --> 49:18.369
<i>Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.</i>

49:19.012 --> 49:22.880
<i>As you can see by the rest of
your armada, you have no choice.</i>

49:23.350 --> 49:27.446
<i>You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.</i>

49:28.088 --> 49:29.487
<i>That is all.</i>

49:38.565 --> 49:40.430
- He will kill you. You know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

49:40.430 --> 49:43.503
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

49:43.503 --> 49:45.333
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

49:45.333 --> 49:47.099
I understand that.

49:47.908 --> 49:51.139
I need officers who have been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

49:51.139 --> 49:54.476
- I have training, sir.
- Come with me.

49:55.382 --> 49:57.680
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.481
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

50:21.608 --> 50:23.542
Prepare the red matter.

50:25.012 --> 50:26.309
Yes, sir.

51:04.885 --> 51:07.046
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship...

51:07.046 --> 51:09.179
...we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

51:09.179 --> 51:14.192
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

51:14.661 --> 51:17.289
You will land on that machine
they have lowered into the atmosphere...

51:17.289 --> 51:20.525
...that's scrambling our gear.
You will get inside, you'll disable it...

51:20.525 --> 51:21.931
...then you will beam back to the ship.

51:21.931 --> 51:25.527
Mr. Spock, I am leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.

51:25.739 --> 51:28.139
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up...

51:28.139 --> 51:31.143
...you will contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

51:31.143 --> 51:33.042
And if all else fails, fall back...

51:33.042 --> 51:35.205
...and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

51:35.205 --> 51:36.714
Kirk, I am promoting you to first officer.

51:36.714 --> 51:38.182
- What?
- Captain?

51:38.182 --> 51:41.277
Please, I apologize, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

51:41.277 --> 51:45.950
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I am not the Captain, you are.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.357
Let's go.

51:51.398 --> 51:53.696
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

51:53.696 --> 51:56.132
Well, I guess you will have to come
and get me.

51:56.132 --> 51:58.704
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

52:10.183 --> 52:11.673
Dr. Puri, report.

52:11.673 --> 52:14.652
<i>It's McCoy.</i>
Dr. Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

52:16.523 --> 52:19.822
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

52:19.822 --> 52:21.394
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

52:22.562 --> 52:24.530
<i>Shuttle 37, you're clear forward.</i>

52:25.132 --> 52:28.397
<i>Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.</i>

52:28.397 --> 52:30.902
<i>Interval check shows positive and steady.</i>

52:31.571 --> 52:33.596
- You got the charges, right?
- Oh, yeah.

52:33.596 --> 52:36.505
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

52:36.505 --> 52:38.475
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

52:42.349 --> 52:45.876
Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.

52:58.198 --> 53:00.132
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

53:00.132 --> 53:01.598
Fencing.

53:04.871 --> 53:06.099
Pre-jump.

53:10.444 --> 53:13.936
<i>Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.</i>

53:20.420 --> 53:22.354
<i>Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.</i>

53:22.354 --> 53:25.448
<i>We have one shot
to land on that platform.</i>

53:25.448 --> 53:28.755
<i>They may have defenses,
so pull your chute as late as possible.</i>

53:28.755 --> 53:31.797
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

53:33.533 --> 53:35.728
<i>Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back...</i>

53:35.728 --> 53:37.303
<i>...until you turn off that drill.</i>

53:39.339 --> 53:40.363
Good luck.

54:02.362 --> 54:04.887
Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir.

54:04.887 --> 54:06.397
Twenty thousand meters.

54:31.058 --> 54:33.253
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 meters.

54:33.253 --> 54:37.353
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 meters.

54:40.167 --> 54:42.067
Forty-six hundred meters
from the platform.

54:42.067 --> 54:43.568
Forty-five hundred meters to target.

54:45.605 --> 54:47.038
Four thousand meters.

54:47.038 --> 54:49.267
- Three thousand meters.
- Three thousand meters.

54:49.267 --> 54:51.469
- Two thousand meters.
- Pulling chute.

54:57.317 --> 55:00.616
- Two thousand meters.
- Come on, pull your chute, Olson.

55:00.987 --> 55:03.820
No, not yet. Not yet. 1,500 meters.

55:03.820 --> 55:07.485
- Olson, open your chute.
- Olson, pull your chute.

55:07.485 --> 55:09.289
One thousand meters.

55:14.701 --> 55:15.725
No.

55:21.775 --> 55:22.969
Olson!

55:24.211 --> 55:25.610
Olson is gone, sir.

55:45.799 --> 55:47.494
Kirk has landed, sir.

57:51.258 --> 57:53.886
Give me your hand. Come on.

58:00.133 --> 58:01.964
Olson had the charges.

58:02.836 --> 58:04.030
I know.

58:06.306 --> 58:08.501
- What do we do?
- This.

58:21.321 --> 58:24.620
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are reestablished.

58:24.620 --> 58:28.125
- Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
- Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

58:28.125 --> 58:29.661
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

58:29.661 --> 58:31.958
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

58:37.270 --> 58:40.637
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

58:40.637 --> 58:41.934
Launch the red matter.

58:56.990 --> 59:00.084
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched
something at the planet...

59:00.084 --> 59:01.524
...through the hole they just drilled.

59:01.895 --> 59:03.988
<i>- Do you copy, Enterprise?</i>
- Yes, sir.

59:03.988 --> 59:05.587
- Analyzing data now.
- Transporter is now operational.

59:05.587 --> 59:08.497
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

59:08.497 --> 59:10.660
If my calculations are correct...

59:10.660 --> 59:15.833
...they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

59:18.244 --> 59:21.611
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

59:21.611 --> 59:24.377
- Yes, sir.
- How long does the planet have?

59:26.519 --> 59:28.350
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

59:29.756 --> 59:31.917
Alert Vulcan Command Center
to signal a planet-wide evacuation...

59:31.917 --> 59:33.390
...all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, wait.

59:33.390 --> 59:35.256
- Maintain standard orbit.
- Yes, sir.

59:35.256 --> 59:37.421
- Where are you going?
- To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

59:37.421 --> 59:39.521
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

59:39.521 --> 59:41.725
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

59:41.725 --> 59:44.269
It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.

59:44.269 --> 59:46.066
I must get them myself.

59:46.066 --> 59:48.367
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye.

59:51.878 --> 59:54.458
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

59:54.458 --> 59:55.678
Stand by.
Locking on your signal.

59:56.683 --> 59:59.948
- Retract the drill. Let's move out.
- Yes, sir. Pull it up.

01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:06.051
I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move.

01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:07.820
- Kirk.
- Sulu.

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:16.626
Sulu.

01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:21.170
Hold on.

01:00:23.643 --> 01:00:25.338
I got you. Now pull my chute.

01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:37.583
Kirk to Enterprise. We're falling
without a chute. Beam us up.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.555
I am trying. I can't lock on
to your signal. Beam us up.

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:41.286
- You're moving too fast.
<i>- Beam us up!</i>

01:00:41.286 --> 01:00:43.656
I can do that. I can do that.

01:00:44.464 --> 01:00:46.159
- Take the conn.
- Aye, sir.

01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:47.324
The black hole's expanding.

01:00:47.324 --> 01:00:49.732
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:53.096
Move, move, move, move, move.

01:00:53.096 --> 01:00:55.037
I can do that. I can do that.
Move, move, move, move.

01:00:55.675 --> 01:00:57.802
Quick, give me manual control.
I can lock on.

01:00:57.802 --> 01:00:59.242
<i>Beam us up.</i>

01:01:01.381 --> 01:01:02.814
Enterprise, where are you?

01:01:02.814 --> 01:01:04.611
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:08.016
Now, now, now. Do it now.
Now, now, now, now.

01:01:08.016 --> 01:01:13.582
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on.
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.121
Gotcha.

01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:32.411
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:37.345
Clear the pad.
I am beaming to the surface.

01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:39.846
The surface of what?

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.450
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

01:01:43.289 --> 01:01:46.316
- Spock, you can't do that.
- Energize. - Spock.

01:02:25.064 --> 01:02:26.861
- Spock.
- The planet has only seconds left.

01:02:26.861 --> 01:02:28.126
We must evacuate.

01:02:29.102 --> 01:02:30.433
Mother, now.

01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:55.199
- Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
- Locking volume.

01:02:55.199 --> 01:02:57.360
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

01:03:03.876 --> 01:03:07.869
Transport in five, four, three, two...

01:03:10.817 --> 01:03:12.512
- Mother.
- Im losing her.

01:03:12.752 --> 01:03:14.617
Im losing her. Im losing her.

01:03:14.617 --> 01:03:17.814
No. I lost her.
I lost her.

01:04:13.179 --> 01:04:17.377
<i>Acting Captain's Log,
Stardate 2258.42.</i>

01:04:18.584 --> 01:04:20.711
<i>We have had no word
from Captain Pike.</i>

01:04:22.422 --> 01:04:23.616
<i>I have therefore classified him...</i>

01:04:23.616 --> 01:04:26.590
<i>...a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.</i>

01:04:27.093 --> 01:04:28.924
<i>Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet...</i>

01:04:28.924 --> 01:04:31.690
<i>...and most of its six billion inhabitants.</i>

01:04:33.366 --> 01:04:35.698
<i>While the essence of our culture
has been saved...</i>

01:04:35.698 --> 01:04:38.862
<i>...in the elders
who now reside upon this ship.</i>

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.134
<i>I estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.</i>

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:49.811
<i>I am now a member
of an endangered species.</i>

01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:18.774
Im sorry.

01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:22.544
Im sorry.

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:25.884
Im so sorry.

01:05:39.932 --> 01:05:41.957
What do you need? Tell me.

01:05:42.935 --> 01:05:44.163
Tell me.

01:05:52.712 --> 01:05:57.740
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

01:06:05.691 --> 01:06:06.749
Okay.

01:06:25.678 --> 01:06:28.340
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

01:06:29.015 --> 01:06:30.983
I only have one for you.

01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:36.986
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids...

01:06:36.986 --> 01:06:39.649
...specifically those surrounding Earth.

01:06:41.394 --> 01:06:44.625
Christopher, answer my question.

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.789
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed...

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:49.697
...against a peaceful planet.
- No, I prevented genocide.

01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:58.569
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

01:06:58.569 --> 01:07:01.579
I chose a life of honest labor...

01:07:01.579 --> 01:07:05.879
...to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

01:07:05.879 --> 01:07:10.649
I was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing...

01:07:10.649 --> 01:07:14.123
...and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

01:07:14.123 --> 01:07:17.126
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

01:07:17.126 --> 01:07:19.095
No, you're confused.

01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:21.359
You have been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:22.900
Its out there right now.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.993
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:26.969
It has happened! I watched it happen!

01:07:26.969 --> 01:07:30.133
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

01:07:34.247 --> 01:07:38.547
And when I lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

01:07:39.452 --> 01:07:43.582
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation...

01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:46.453
...and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:49.621
But I did not forget the pain.

01:07:51.097 --> 01:07:54.533
Its a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:58.467
My purpose, Christopher...

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:02.200
...is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love...

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:08.404
...but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

01:08:11.484 --> 01:08:14.078
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

01:08:15.521 --> 01:08:19.924
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets...

01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:21.926
...starting with yours.

01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:25.356
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:32.631
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defenses.

01:08:35.508 --> 01:08:37.100
Centaurian slugs.

01:08:38.277 --> 01:08:40.506
They latch on to your brain stem...

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.844
...and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:47.719
Frequencies, please, sir.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.648
Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...

01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:52.154
As you wish.

01:08:59.799 --> 01:09:01.663
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

01:09:01.663 --> 01:09:04.861
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

01:09:04.861 --> 01:09:07.633
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Earth may be his next stop...

01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:10.573
...but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

01:09:10.573 --> 01:09:12.143
Out of the chair.

01:09:12.143 --> 01:09:16.442
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

01:09:16.442 --> 01:09:19.211
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

01:09:19.211 --> 01:09:20.910
That is not it.

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:22.453
He said he wanted me
to see something...

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:23.953
...the destruction of my home planet.

01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:26.115
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

01:09:26.115 --> 01:09:28.193
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

01:09:28.193 --> 01:09:30.091
The engineering comprehension necessary...

01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:33.654
...to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

01:09:33.654 --> 01:09:36.064
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated...

01:09:36.064 --> 01:09:38.295
...to create a tunnel through space-time.

01:09:38.295 --> 01:09:40.429
Damn it, man,
Im a doctor, not a physicist.

01:09:40.429 --> 01:09:42.166
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:45.265
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable...

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:47.470
...must be the truth.
- How poetic.

01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:51.345
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

01:09:51.345 --> 01:09:53.941
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:55.714
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship...

01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:57.789
...disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

01:09:57.789 --> 01:09:59.983
We are technologically outmatched
in every way.

01:09:59.983 --> 01:10:02.219
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

01:10:02.219 --> 01:10:05.092
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

01:10:05.092 --> 01:10:07.290
Then what about
assigning engineering crews...

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.766
...to try and boost our warp yield?
- Remaining power and crew are being...

01:10:09.766 --> 01:10:11.734
...used to repair radiation leaks
on the lower decks.... - Okay. All right.

01:10:11.734 --> 01:10:13.566
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which...

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:15.401
...we cannot contact Starfleet.
- There's got to be some way...

01:10:15.401 --> 01:10:17.840
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet...

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.672
...to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:21.303
There won't be a next engagement.

01:10:21.303 --> 01:10:24.315
By the time we have gathered,
it will be too late.

01:10:24.315 --> 01:10:26.817
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's going to happen?

01:10:26.817 --> 01:10:29.046
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

01:10:29.046 --> 01:10:32.716
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

01:10:32.716 --> 01:10:35.555
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history...

01:10:35.555 --> 01:10:37.286
...beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin...

01:10:37.286 --> 01:10:38.385
...culminating in the events of today...

01:10:38.385 --> 01:10:40.931
...thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents...

01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:43.763
...that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

01:10:43.763 --> 01:10:45.393
An alternate reality.

01:10:46.338 --> 01:10:47.506
Precisely.

01:10:48.174 --> 01:10:52.167
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted...

01:10:52.778 --> 01:10:54.837
...our destinies have changed.

01:10:54.837 --> 01:10:57.415
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

01:10:57.415 --> 01:10:58.778
Spock, don't do that.

01:10:58.778 --> 01:11:02.650
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive....

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.916
...waste of time. - These are the orders
issued by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

01:11:04.916 --> 01:11:06.821
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

01:11:06.821 --> 01:11:08.393
Spock, you are Captain now.

01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:09.927
- You have to make...
- I am aware of my responsibilities...

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:12.395
...Mr. Kirk. - Every second we waste,
Nero's getting closer to his next target.

01:11:12.395 --> 01:11:14.466
That is correct, and why
Im instructing you to accept the fact...

01:11:14.466 --> 01:11:17.092
...that I alone am in command.
- I will not allow us to go backwards...

01:11:17.092 --> 01:11:18.795
- Jim, he's the Captain.
...away from the problem...

01:11:18.795 --> 01:11:22.431
...instead of hunting Nero down.
- Security, escort him out.

01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:32.111
- Hey.
- Enough, Jim.

01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:39.718
Get him off this ship.

01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:03.060
- Computer, where am I?
<i>- Location, Delta Vega.</i>

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.259
<i>Class-M planet. Unsafe.</i>

01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:08.633
<i>There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometers to the northwest.</i>

01:12:08.938 --> 01:12:12.633
<i>- Remain in your pod until retrieved by Starfleet
authorities.</i> - You got to be kidding me.

01:12:55.218 --> 01:12:58.483
Stardate 2258.42.

01:12:59.222 --> 01:13:03.090
Or 44. Whatever.

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:06.821
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega...

01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:11.492
...in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09...

01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:13.831
...governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:26.168
James T. Kirk.

01:15:28.638 --> 01:15:30.970
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

01:15:33.009 --> 01:15:34.977
How do you know my name?

01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:39.708
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.079
- Look, I don't know you.
- I am Spock.

01:15:53.029 --> 01:15:54.018
Bullshit.

01:15:54.697 --> 01:15:57.928
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:00.594
Especially after the events of today.

01:16:02.505 --> 01:16:04.564
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today...

01:16:04.564 --> 01:16:08.508
...but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

01:16:08.508 --> 01:16:11.102
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

01:16:11.102 --> 01:16:13.114
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

01:16:13.114 --> 01:16:15.150
You are not the captain?

01:16:17.987 --> 01:16:23.584
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:26.255
By Nero.

01:16:32.235 --> 01:16:34.328
What do you know about him?

01:16:34.771 --> 01:16:37.331
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

01:16:38.674 --> 01:16:44.112
- Please, allow me. It will be easier.
- What are you doing?

01:16:44.112 --> 01:16:46.807
Our minds, one and together.

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:52.019
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now...

01:16:52.019 --> 01:16:56.148
...a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

01:16:57.326 --> 01:17:00.921
That is where Im from,
Jim, the future.

01:17:05.401 --> 01:17:11.499
A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.

01:17:12.241 --> 01:17:15.677
I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.

01:17:21.017 --> 01:17:23.212
We outfitted our fastest ship.

01:17:24.654 --> 01:17:29.124
Using red matter, I would create a black hole
which would absorb the exploding star.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.758
I was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.

01:17:35.264 --> 01:17:38.290
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.767
I had little time.

01:17:48.477 --> 01:17:52.345
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

01:18:09.165 --> 01:18:11.599
As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.

01:18:11.968 --> 01:18:15.836
He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.

01:18:16.405 --> 01:18:20.501
In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.

01:18:28.451 --> 01:18:31.909
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

01:18:37.994 --> 01:18:42.590
Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.757
But what was years for Nero...

01:18:46.302 --> 01:18:48.236
...was only seconds for me.

01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:51.432
I went through the black hole.

01:18:53.643 --> 01:18:55.975
Nero was waiting for me.

01:19:01.817 --> 01:19:04.945
He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.

01:19:06.822 --> 01:19:09.518
He captured my vessel
and spared my life...

01:19:10.826 --> 01:19:15.694
...for one reason.
So that I would know his pain.

01:19:17.733 --> 01:19:21.601
He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.

01:19:23.272 --> 01:19:25.934
As he was helpless to save his planet...

01:19:26.575 --> 01:19:29.339
...I would be helpless to save mine.

01:19:32.515 --> 01:19:36.474
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.447
Because I failed.

01:19:42.024 --> 01:19:45.983
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

01:19:53.602 --> 01:19:56.196
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

01:19:57.039 --> 01:20:00.065
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

01:20:00.443 --> 01:20:03.276
Jim, we must go.

01:20:04.046 --> 01:20:07.038
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

01:20:07.984 --> 01:20:11.852
Wait. Where you came from...

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:16.252
...did I know my father?

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.484
Yes.

01:20:19.328 --> 01:20:23.458
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:27.296
He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.232
Captain?

01:20:29.232 --> 01:20:32.466
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:43.116
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

01:20:43.116 --> 01:20:45.847
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

01:20:45.847 --> 01:20:49.356
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.058
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

01:20:53.058 --> 01:20:56.029
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

01:20:56.029 --> 01:20:57.756
Is that a thank-you?

01:20:57.756 --> 01:21:00.529
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

01:21:00.529 --> 01:21:02.399
Permission to speak freely, sir.

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:07.342
- I welcome it.
- Do you? Okay, then.

01:21:07.676 --> 01:21:10.076
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

01:21:10.076 --> 01:21:12.647
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

01:21:12.647 --> 01:21:14.511
Probably. But the right one?

01:21:14.511 --> 01:21:16.050
You know, back home we got a saying,

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:17.551
"If you're going to ride
in the Kentucky Derby,"

01:21:17.551 --> 01:21:19.951
"you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable."

01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:21.318
A curious metaphor, Doctor...

01:21:21.318 --> 01:21:25.758
...as a stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

01:21:25.758 --> 01:21:28.159
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision.

01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:29.526
I intend to assist in the effort...

01:21:29.526 --> 01:21:32.192
...to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:36.168
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping...

01:21:36.168 --> 01:21:39.241
...I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

01:21:40.509 --> 01:21:41.806
Excuse me.

01:21:46.248 --> 01:21:47.681
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

01:22:25.287 --> 01:22:26.447
Hello.

01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:10.223
What?

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:16.201
You realize how unacceptable this is?

01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:17.704
- Fascinating.
- What?

01:23:17.704 --> 01:23:19.239
Okay, Im sure you're just
doing your job...

01:23:19.239 --> 01:23:21.138
...but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

01:23:21.138 --> 01:23:22.471
Six months Ive been here...

01:23:22.471 --> 01:23:25.672
...living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal.

01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:28.475
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:30.449
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

01:23:30.449 --> 01:23:32.418
For something
that was clearly an accident.

01:23:32.418 --> 01:23:35.319
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

01:23:35.319 --> 01:23:37.483
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

01:23:37.483 --> 01:23:40.721
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:43.457
- Me.
- Get aff. Shut up.

01:23:43.457 --> 01:23:45.932
You don't eat anything.
You can eat, like, a bean,

01:23:45.932 --> 01:23:49.493
and you're done.
Im talking about food. Real food.

01:23:49.493 --> 01:23:52.005
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

01:23:52.005 --> 01:23:54.007
You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott...

01:23:54.007 --> 01:23:56.304
...who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

01:23:56.304 --> 01:23:59.677
That's what Im talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

01:23:59.677 --> 01:24:01.249
I had a little debate with my instructor...

01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:05.446
...on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

01:24:05.446 --> 01:24:09.456
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit...

01:24:09.456 --> 01:24:11.048
...was limited to about 100 miles.

01:24:11.048 --> 01:24:13.856
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet...

01:24:13.856 --> 01:24:15.931
...to the adjacent planet
in the same system...

01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:17.692
...which is easy, by the way...

01:24:17.692 --> 01:24:19.199
...I could do it with a life-form.

01:24:19.199 --> 01:24:22.464
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

01:24:22.464 --> 01:24:26.200
- I know that dog. What happened to it?
- Ill tell you when it reappears.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.173
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

01:24:28.173 --> 01:24:31.144
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct...

01:24:31.144 --> 01:24:34.478
...that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is traveling at warp speed?

01:24:34.478 --> 01:24:37.074
I think if that equation had been
discovered, Id have heard about it.

01:24:37.074 --> 01:24:39.051
The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott...

01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:41.952
...is because you haven't discovered it yet.

01:24:46.962 --> 01:24:50.295
- Are you from the future?
- Yeah, he is. Im not.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.694
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

01:24:53.694 --> 01:24:55.496
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

01:24:55.496 --> 01:24:59.472
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

01:24:59.472 --> 01:25:00.667
On youse go.

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:03.802
So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?

01:25:03.802 --> 01:25:05.573
She is one well-endowed lady.

01:25:05.573 --> 01:25:07.672
Id like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles...

01:25:07.672 --> 01:25:10.547
...if you will pardon
the engineering parlance.

01:25:11.553 --> 01:25:14.215
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right...

01:25:14.215 --> 01:25:17.815
...where you're from, what Ive done,
which I don't, by the way...

01:25:17.815 --> 01:25:20.394
...you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise...

01:25:20.394 --> 01:25:23.329
...while she's traveling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

01:25:23.329 --> 01:25:26.230
Get off there.
Its not a climbing frame.

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:30.965
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet...

01:25:30.965 --> 01:25:33.940
...whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:35.032
What's that?

01:25:35.032 --> 01:25:38.204
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

01:25:40.516 --> 01:25:42.006
Get out of it.

01:25:45.988 --> 01:25:47.080
Imagine that.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.352
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

01:25:50.352 --> 01:25:52.757
You're coming with us, right?

01:25:54.396 --> 01:25:58.025
- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
- Your...

01:25:59.068 --> 01:26:01.195
He... The other Spock
is not going to believe me.

01:26:01.195 --> 01:26:02.395
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened. Under...

01:26:02.395 --> 01:26:05.234
....no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

01:26:05.234 --> 01:26:06.399
You must promise me this.

01:26:06.399 --> 01:26:09.636
You're telling me I can't tell you
that Im following your own orders?

01:26:09.636 --> 01:26:13.306
- Why not? What happens?
- Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

01:26:13.306 --> 01:26:16.907
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

01:26:16.907 --> 01:26:20.078
- How? Over your dead body?
- Preferably not.

01:26:20.078 --> 01:26:23.181
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:26.455
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer...

01:26:26.455 --> 01:26:29.622
...who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand...

01:26:29.622 --> 01:26:31.700
...must resign said command.

01:26:33.936 --> 01:26:38.032
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

01:26:38.032 --> 01:26:41.132
Jim, I just lost my planet.

01:26:42.344 --> 01:26:45.245
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

01:26:46.215 --> 01:26:48.979
What you must do is get me to show it.

01:26:48.979 --> 01:26:52.576
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

01:26:56.059 --> 01:27:00.051
No, go. You cannot come with me.
Go on.

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:04.594
You know, coming back in time,
changing history...

01:27:05.134 --> 01:27:06.567
...that's cheating.

01:27:08.804 --> 01:27:11.068
A trick I learned from an old friend.

01:27:19.982 --> 01:27:22.678
Live long and prosper.

01:27:42.838 --> 01:27:44.271
Mr. Scott.

01:27:49.445 --> 01:27:51.675
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:00.948
Hold on a second.

01:28:01.824 --> 01:28:02.813
Oh, no.

01:28:06.462 --> 01:28:08.054
Don't worry, I...

01:28:18.874 --> 01:28:19.898
No. No.

01:28:39.761 --> 01:28:42.252
Turbine release valve activated.

01:28:48.971 --> 01:28:51.405
You all right? You all right?

01:28:53.542 --> 01:28:55.976
My head's buzzing and Im soaked,
but otherwise Im fine.

01:28:56.211 --> 01:29:02.081
Captain Spock. Detecting unauthorized
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

01:29:02.081 --> 01:29:03.344
Bring up the video.

01:29:07.589 --> 01:29:09.216
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

01:29:09.216 --> 01:29:12.191
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

01:29:12.191 --> 01:29:13.419
Set phasers to stun.

01:29:25.474 --> 01:29:26.964
- Halt.
- No, no.

01:29:30.913 --> 01:29:33.711
Come with me, cupcake.

01:29:42.024 --> 01:29:43.048
- Who are you?
- Im with him.

01:29:43.048 --> 01:29:45.490
- He's with me.
- We are traveling at warp speed.

01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:47.152
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:48.456
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

01:29:48.456 --> 01:29:51.692
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

01:29:51.692 --> 01:29:54.792
Well, Im not telling, Acting Captain.

01:29:55.337 --> 01:29:56.361
What, did...

01:29:56.361 --> 01:29:59.531
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

01:29:59.531 --> 01:30:02.201
- That doesn't make you angry.
- Are you a member of Starfleet?

01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:04.677
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

01:30:04.677 --> 01:30:06.941
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me...

01:30:06.941 --> 01:30:09.381
...how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

01:30:09.381 --> 01:30:10.917
- Well...
- Don't answer him.

01:30:10.917 --> 01:30:12.714
You will answer me.

01:30:14.489 --> 01:30:17.947
- Id rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

01:30:19.895 --> 01:30:22.261
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered...

01:30:22.261 --> 01:30:25.458
...and you're not even upset.
- If you are presuming...

01:30:25.458 --> 01:30:28.536
...that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship...

01:30:28.536 --> 01:30:30.366
...you are mistaken.
- And yet, you are the one...

01:30:30.366 --> 01:30:33.270
...who said fear was necessary
for command. I mean...

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:36.776
...did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

01:30:37.312 --> 01:30:39.371
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

01:30:39.371 --> 01:30:41.711
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

01:30:41.711 --> 01:30:43.978
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

01:30:43.978 --> 01:30:47.385
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

01:30:48.023 --> 01:30:49.149
Or the need to stop at nothing...

01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:51.248
...to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

01:30:51.248 --> 01:30:53.293
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing.

01:30:53.293 --> 01:30:55.556
It must not even compute for you.

01:30:56.331 --> 01:30:57.389
You never loved her.

01:31:22.457 --> 01:31:23.583
Spock.

01:32:01.096 --> 01:32:03.621
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

01:32:04.032 --> 01:32:05.556
I hereby relinquish my command...

01:32:05.556 --> 01:32:09.694
...based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

01:32:09.694 --> 01:32:12.865
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.361
I like this ship. You know, it's exciting.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.607
Well, congratulations, Jim.

01:32:46.607 --> 01:32:51.042
Now we have got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

01:32:52.114 --> 01:32:53.240
Yeah, we do.

01:32:53.882 --> 01:32:56.407
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

01:32:56.407 --> 01:32:59.611
- You got to be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:06.049
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

01:33:07.863 --> 01:33:09.262
So do I.

01:33:13.902 --> 01:33:16.268
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.

01:33:17.939 --> 01:33:22.069
<i>Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.</i>

01:33:22.577 --> 01:33:25.910
<i>I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet...</i>

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:28.380
<i>...but Im ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.</i>

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.714
<i>I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.</i>

01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:35.851
Either we're going down or they are.

01:33:37.459 --> 01:33:38.687
Kirk out.

01:33:46.168 --> 01:33:48.033
Speak your mind, Spock.

01:33:50.972 --> 01:33:52.633
That would be unwise.

01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:56.742
What is necessary is never unwise.

01:33:58.079 --> 01:34:01.276
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

01:34:03.218 --> 01:34:06.016
You will always be a child of two worlds.

01:34:07.823 --> 01:34:09.723
I am grateful for this.

01:34:11.726 --> 01:34:13.091
And for you.

01:34:15.063 --> 01:34:18.294
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:21.862
An anger I cannot control.

01:34:26.141 --> 01:34:31.101
I believe that she would say...

01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:34.205
..."Do not try to."

01:34:35.617 --> 01:34:40.486
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

01:34:44.526 --> 01:34:46.687
I married her because I loved her.

01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:57.233
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

01:34:57.233 --> 01:35:00.139
We can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim,
not with their technology.

01:35:00.139 --> 01:35:02.369
- Im telling you, the math doesn't support what
you're suggesting. - Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!

01:35:02.369 --> 01:35:04.604
- Captain Kirk!
- Yes, Mr. Chekov. What is it?

01:35:04.604 --> 01:35:06.806
Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan...

01:35:06.806 --> 01:35:10.146
...I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

01:35:10.146 --> 01:35:13.517
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he will destroy us.

01:35:13.517 --> 01:35:15.954
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4...

01:35:15.954 --> 01:35:20.687
...and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan...

01:35:20.687 --> 01:35:23.389
...the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings...

01:35:23.389 --> 01:35:25.693
...will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

01:35:25.693 --> 01:35:28.166
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated...

01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:31.433
...we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
- Aye, that might work.

01:35:32.173 --> 01:35:33.731
Wait a minute, kid.
How old are you?

01:35:33.731 --> 01:35:36.538
- Seventeen, sir.
- Oh, good, he's 17.

01:35:36.538 --> 01:35:38.272
Doctor.

01:35:38.272 --> 01:35:41.781
Mr. Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

01:35:42.183 --> 01:35:44.117
If Mr. Sulu is able
to maneuver us into position,

01:35:44.117 --> 01:35:46.949
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device...

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:49.819
...and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

01:35:49.819 --> 01:35:52.587
I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock.

01:35:52.587 --> 01:35:55.720
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.855
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me...

01:35:57.855 --> 01:36:01.094
...to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:04.438
Also, my mother was human...

01:36:04.438 --> 01:36:07.531
...which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

01:36:13.782 --> 01:36:15.875
Then Im coming with you.

01:36:15.875 --> 01:36:20.011
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:24.554
See? We're getting to know each other.

01:36:40.575 --> 01:36:41.667
Prepare the drill.

01:36:57.959 --> 01:37:03.454
All stop in three, two, one.

01:37:09.037 --> 01:37:11.597
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

01:37:11.597 --> 01:37:13.571
Ill do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

01:37:13.571 --> 01:37:15.870
- Aye.
- Fire.

01:37:43.171 --> 01:37:45.867
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

01:37:45.867 --> 01:37:48.408
Really? Fine job, Mr. Sulu.
Well done.

01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:53.377
- How are we, Scotty?
- Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

01:37:56.584 --> 01:37:58.677
Whatever happens, Mr. Sulu...

01:37:58.677 --> 01:38:00.482
...if you think you have
the tactical advantage...

01:38:00.482 --> 01:38:04.149
...you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

01:38:05.727 --> 01:38:06.853
Yes, sir.

01:38:06.853 --> 01:38:08.518
<i>Otherwise we will contact
the Enterprise...</i>

01:38:08.518 --> 01:38:10.954
<i>...when we're ready
to be beamed back.</i>

01:38:10.954 --> 01:38:12.259
Good luck.

01:38:25.246 --> 01:38:28.147
- I will be back.
- You better be.

01:38:29.951 --> 01:38:32.920
- Ill be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:52.535
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

01:38:52.535 --> 01:38:54.505
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense...

01:38:54.505 --> 01:38:55.871
...in the design of the enemy ship...

01:38:55.871 --> 01:38:57.911
...I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

01:38:57.911 --> 01:39:00.708
- Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
- Energize.

01:39:44.025 --> 01:39:46.391
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

01:39:46.794 --> 01:39:48.853
<i>- One of them is Vulcan.</i>
- No.

01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:54.726
Ayel!

01:40:09.517 --> 01:40:10.677
Ill cover you.

01:40:11.186 --> 01:40:13.086
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, I got you.

01:40:32.941 --> 01:40:36.206
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

01:40:38.146 --> 01:40:39.738
And Captain Pike.

01:41:02.503 --> 01:41:03.697
Move.

01:41:04.239 --> 01:41:06.298
They have activated the drill.

01:41:07.508 --> 01:41:09.100
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.677
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

01:41:10.677 --> 01:41:12.405
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

01:41:12.405 --> 01:41:14.071
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

01:41:33.334 --> 01:41:34.699
I foresee a complication.

01:41:34.699 --> 01:41:37.396
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

01:41:37.396 --> 01:41:40.497
<i>Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.</i>

01:41:40.497 --> 01:41:42.701
<i>Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.</i>

01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:44.300
Wow, that's weird.

01:41:45.446 --> 01:41:48.279
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

01:41:48.279 --> 01:41:52.820
<i>Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.</i>

01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:58.350
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:00.450
You're going to be able
to fly this thing, right?

01:42:00.450 --> 01:42:02.995
Something tells me I already have.

01:42:03.631 --> 01:42:05.155
- Good luck.
- Jim.

01:42:06.367 --> 01:42:09.700
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.829
- It will work.
- In the event that I do not return...

01:42:11.829 --> 01:42:13.930
...please tell Lieutenant Uhura--
- Spock.

01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:15.737
Itll work.

01:42:25.553 --> 01:42:27.020
Fascinating.

01:42:35.663 --> 01:42:37.654
Start-up sequence initiated.

01:43:21.276 --> 01:43:24.901
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will--

01:43:34.689 --> 01:43:37.658
I know your face from Earth's history.

01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:26.262
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

01:44:26.262 --> 01:44:28.740
He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.174
But that was another life.

01:44:31.045 --> 01:44:34.105
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

01:45:06.714 --> 01:45:09.209
<i>Captain Nero.
The Vulcan ship has been taken.</i>

01:45:09.209 --> 01:45:10.912
<i>The drill has been destroyed.</i>

01:45:11.352 --> 01:45:12.319
Spock.

01:45:14.155 --> 01:45:15.679
Spock.

01:45:33.341 --> 01:45:34.740
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:36.544 --> 01:45:39.479
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

01:45:39.747 --> 01:45:43.042
I hereby confiscate this illegally obtained ship
and order you to surrender your vessel.

01:45:43.284 --> 01:45:45.252
- No terms. No deals.
- That ship, take it out.

01:45:45.252 --> 01:45:46.547
Sir, if you ignite the red matter...

01:45:46.547 --> 01:45:48.087
...you will destroy...
- I want Spock dead now!

01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:07.201
- He went to warp, sir.
- Go after him! - Yes, sir.

01:46:37.405 --> 01:46:40.431
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

01:46:41.842 --> 01:46:43.901
- I can't...
- You can't what?

01:46:43.901 --> 01:46:45.602
You can't even speak.

01:46:48.215 --> 01:46:50.945
- What?
- I got your gun.

01:47:17.678 --> 01:47:18.736
What's he doing?

01:47:19.213 --> 01:47:22.080
<i>Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.</i>

01:47:22.883 --> 01:47:23.872
Fire everything!

01:47:31.258 --> 01:47:35.456
<i>Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.</i>

01:47:35.456 --> 01:47:36.961
Understood.

01:47:43.304 --> 01:47:44.794
Captain, Ive picked up another ship.

01:48:06.627 --> 01:48:09.755
- What are you doing here?
- Just following orders.

01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:30.742
Enterprise, now.

01:48:54.175 --> 01:48:55.904
Nice timing, Scotty.

01:48:56.844 --> 01:49:00.780
Ive never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before.

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.712
- Jim.
- Bones.

01:49:02.712 --> 01:49:04.444
I got him.

01:49:06.654 --> 01:49:07.678
That was pretty good.

01:49:09.023 --> 01:49:12.220
Captain, the enemy ship is losing power.
Their shields are down, sir.

01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:13.725
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

01:49:48.929 --> 01:49:51.762
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

01:49:52.233 --> 01:49:53.564
Your ship is compromised.

01:49:53.564 --> 01:49:56.158
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance...

01:49:56.158 --> 01:49:58.067
...which we are willing to provide.

01:50:01.442 --> 01:50:03.842
- Captain, what are you doing?
- Showing them compassion...

01:50:03.842 --> 01:50:05.639
...may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

01:50:05.639 --> 01:50:08.738
Its logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

01:50:08.738 --> 01:50:11.545
No, not really. Not this time.

01:50:11.545 --> 01:50:16.112
<i>I would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.</i>

01:50:16.112 --> 01:50:20.455
<i>I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.</i>

01:50:20.455 --> 01:50:22.358
You got it.

01:50:22.358 --> 01:50:25.296
- Arm phasers. Fire everything we have got.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:10.511 --> 01:51:12.775
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:24.158 --> 01:51:26.149
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:28.455
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

01:51:28.455 --> 01:51:29.893
You bet your ass, Captain.

01:51:33.567 --> 01:51:35.592
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well.
Its got us!

01:51:35.592 --> 01:51:39.161
- Go to maximum warp. Push it.
- Im giving her all she's got, Captain!

01:51:48.549 --> 01:51:49.982
All she's got isn't good enough.

01:51:49.982 --> 01:51:53.451
<i>- What else you got?</i>
- Okay, if we eject the core and detonate...

01:51:53.451 --> 01:51:54.816
...the blast could be enough
to push us away.

01:51:54.816 --> 01:51:56.082
I cannot promise anything, though.

01:51:59.727 --> 01:52:01.160
Do it, do it, do it.

01:52:02.396 --> 01:52:04.193
- Clear the area. Go.
- Yes, sir.

01:53:31.785 --> 01:53:33.343
Father.

01:53:41.729 --> 01:53:43.458
I am not our father.

01:53:51.138 --> 01:53:55.768
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

01:53:58.946 --> 01:54:00.072
Then why did you send Kirk aboard...

01:54:00.072 --> 01:54:02.080
...when you alone
could have explained the truth?

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.618
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you...

01:54:05.618 --> 01:54:08.347
...of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together...

01:54:08.347 --> 01:54:13.620
...of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realize.

01:54:15.562 --> 01:54:17.655
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

01:54:17.655 --> 01:54:21.132
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue...

01:54:21.132 --> 01:54:23.635
...should he break his promise.
- You lied.

01:54:25.105 --> 01:54:27.198
I... I implied.

01:54:27.775 --> 01:54:29.766
- A gamble.
- An act of faith.

01:54:30.878 --> 01:54:34.041
One I hope that you will repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

01:54:34.041 --> 01:54:35.775
In the face of extinction, it is only logical...

01:54:35.775 --> 01:54:38.579
...I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

01:54:38.579 --> 01:54:40.949
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

01:54:42.289 --> 01:54:44.985
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

01:54:45.459 --> 01:54:49.759
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

01:54:49.759 --> 01:54:53.560
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor.

01:54:55.102 --> 01:54:58.333
Put aside logic.
Do what feels right.

01:55:04.244 --> 01:55:07.907
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving...

01:55:07.907 --> 01:55:09.243
...I shall simply say...

01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:11.749
...good luck.

01:55:22.696 --> 01:55:26.359
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

01:55:27.034 --> 01:55:30.401
Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades...

01:55:30.401 --> 01:55:33.166
...is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service...

01:55:33.166 --> 01:55:38.074
...and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

01:55:39.146 --> 01:55:42.081
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

01:55:46.787 --> 01:55:48.755
By Starfleet Order 28455...

01:55:48.755 --> 01:55:52.917
...you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise...

01:55:52.917 --> 01:55:54.721
...for duty as his relief.

01:56:03.670 --> 01:56:05.365
I relieve you, sir.

01:56:05.806 --> 01:56:07.603
I am relieved.

01:56:09.443 --> 01:56:11.968
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

01:56:13.947 --> 01:56:15.778
Your father would be proud.

01:56:45.279 --> 01:56:46.906
Thrusters on full.

01:56:47.514 --> 01:56:50.278
Maneuvering thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

01:56:50.278 --> 01:56:53.044
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

01:56:53.044 --> 01:56:55.747
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

01:57:00.294 --> 01:57:03.092
Bones. Buckle up.

01:57:07.668 --> 01:57:09.135
Scotty, how we doing?

01:57:09.135 --> 01:57:11.898
Dilithium chamber's at maximum, Captain.

01:57:12.973 --> 01:57:14.372
Get down.

01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:19.311
Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

01:57:22.349 --> 01:57:24.749
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

01:57:25.152 --> 01:57:26.881
Permission granted.

01:57:27.654 --> 01:57:29.713
As you have yet to select a first officer...

01:57:29.713 --> 01:57:32.849
...respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.827
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

01:57:37.331 --> 01:57:39.595
It would be my honor, Commander.

01:57:43.303 --> 01:57:45.703
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

01:57:47.474 --> 01:57:49.339
Thrusters on standby.

01:57:49.339 --> 01:57:51.741
- Take us out.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

01:57:56.717 --> 01:57:59.948
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

01:58:01.788 --> 01:58:05.246
<i>These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.</i>

01:58:06.293 --> 01:58:10.093
<i>Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...</i>

01:58:10.864 --> 01:58:14.664
<i>...to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations...</i>

01:58:15.135 --> 01:58:19.663
<i>...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>
