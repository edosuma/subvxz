00:48.400 --> 00:49.200
Hello?

00:51.100 --> 00:53.500
MAN:
I'm watching you, babysitter.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.200
Who is this?

00:55.800 --> 00:57.200
Justin, is that you?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.600
I'm closer than you think.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.900
Who is this?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.700
I'm in the house.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.700
(dial tone)

01:09.000 --> 01:10.900
(beep)

01:22.200 --> 01:24.200
(phone ringing)

01:39.600 --> 01:41.600
(phone stops ringing)

01:44.100 --> 01:46.100
(eerie breathing)

02:05.200 --> 02:07.200
(eerie breathing continues)

02:21.000 --> 02:21.900
(screams)

02:23.300 --> 02:24.100
Oh, my gosh!

02:24.100 --> 02:26.000
Damn it, Justin, you scad me!

02:26.300 --> 02:28.200
Did you just say a cuss word?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.800
You have no idea what...

02:30.800 --> 02:30.900
(pounding on door)

02:32.500 --> 02:33.300
Wait here.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.600
(pounding)

02:45.600 --> 02:47.600
(pounding)

02:49.800 --> 02:52.200
(pounding)

02:59.900 --> 03:02.200
(pounding)

03:04.900 --> 03:07.300
(door creaking, man groaning)

03:08.800 --> 03:10.800
(man groaning)

03:14.500 --> 03:16.700
(screaming)

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
Who's the girl, Frank?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.500
Girl's name is
Heather Crowley, she's 16.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.900
Babysitting Justin Montavo,
who's 12.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.200
How's she holding up?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.800
Right now,
not very well.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.400
CAINE:
Okay, who's
our victim?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.300
Well, believe
it or not,

03:55.300 --> 03:57.900
it's the babysitter's
father-- EdwarCrowley.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.700
What was he doing here?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.500
Not sure.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.200
Families are
next door neighbors, though.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.700
Okay, the homeowners?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.500
The Montavos, Dave and Renee.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.200
No sign of them.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.800
Sounds like they were sharing  more than a driveway,
doesn't it?

04:09.800 --> 04:11.200
That's the thing about
these neighborhoods--

04:11.400 --> 04:12.900
big houses, big secrets.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.300
Yes. They won't be secrets
for long.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.799
CAINE:
Heather, where do you
think your mom is?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.100
HEATHER:
I don't know.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.699
I keep calling her
and calling her,

05:14.700 --> 05:16.300
and she doesn't answer.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.100
Do you think
she's okay?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.700
You know what?
We're going to find her.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.600
Why don't you tell me
what happened.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.700
HEATHER:
This whole night's
been weird.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.700
Montav never
came home.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.500
And I saw this shadowy figure
in the window, and then...

05:28.600 --> 05:29.299
TRIP
Horatio.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.300
Yeah?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.000
Excuse me.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.100
What do you got, Frank?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.100
Take a look
at this.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.700
Blood trail leads
around to the back.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.800
Okay, Frank,
follow it,  and I'll cch up.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.399
Heather, I'll be
right back, okay?

05:47.400 --> 05:48.500
You sit tight.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.800
* *

06:21.200 --> 06:22.400
I hate to say it,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.100
she fits the description
of the babysitter's mother.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.400
So a bad night
just got worse.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.900
Poor baby Heather.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.100
Witnessed her father die,

07:29.600 --> 07:32.200
and then ID'd her mother
half an hour later.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.800
DELKO:
Get a COD?

07:33.800 --> 07:34.600
Yeah.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.700
Neck was slashed.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.300
Severed her carotid.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.799
We got a blood pool here.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.100
Probably from where
the father got assaulted.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.800
Think I found
what killed the mom.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.800
(screaming)

07:59.100 --> 08:00.800
WOLFE:
Textured surface
on this handle's

08:00.800 --> 08:02.700
going to be impossible to print.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.600
Instrument like that,

08:05.800 --> 08:07.600
blood all over
the body,

08:07.800 --> 08:09.900
means the killer could have
blood on them, too.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.000
I'll test the witnesses
for blood.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.000
Check the
babysitter's hands.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.500
See if she handled the weapon.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.700
You, um...
you sure you're ready?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.700
If we don't do this now,
we risk losing the evidence.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.400
Yeah, I'm ready.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.000
It's nice seeing Eric
back at work.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.000
BOA VISTA:
I know.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.500
It's pretty amazing.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.600
It's only been a few weeks??

08:44.600 --> 08:47.400
Looks like there's a little bit
of grass in the wound

08:48.000 --> 08:49.500
and some kind of...

08:49.800 --> 08:51.200
insect.zhm kuai

08:52.300 --> 08:54.400
Isn't it a little early
for infestation?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.300
You know, insects
are attracted

08:56.300 --> 08:58.199
to hydrocarbons
released postmortem.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.800
It's a pretty
immediate reaction.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.299
Yeah, but I would think
we'd only see maggot larvae

09:02.300 --> 09:05.500
or blowflies on a body that's
been dead more than 12 hours.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Maybe Mr. Crowley was attacked
a lot earlier than his wife.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.999
<i>Could have laid there
for several hours,</i>

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
<i>and then have gone
to the front door for help.</i>

09:16.600 --> 09:18.100
Think it changes our timeline?

09:18.200 --> 09:19.000
I don't know.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.200
Maybe this little guy's
going to tell us.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.000
Hey.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.700
So the babysitter said she saw
someone at this window, right?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.300
Poible Peeping Tom.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.800
Maybe Tom was doing
more than peeping.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.100
How can you tell?

09:42.200 --> 09:42.800
There's fresh
tool marks.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.200
He tried to pry
the window open.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.300
Maybe whoever it was left behind
something more than tool marks.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.900
Yes, it's a glass window.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.900
Good surface for prints.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.100
Maybe we'll get lucky.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.200
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
(beeping)

10:08.500 --> 10:10.700
My fingerprints
on the Montavo window?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.200
How do you know they're mine?

10:13.300 --> 10:16.400
We have your fingerprints
from an old DUI charge.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
(chuckles)

10:18.000 --> 10:19.200
I was in med school.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.600
Yes, and I must tell you

10:20.600 --> 10:23.200
that you're a person of
interest, Mr. Lasker.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.200
Doctor.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.600
Dr. Lasker.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.500
Doctor.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.800
What were you doing
looking through the window?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.100
Dave Montavo borrowed
some tools from me.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.600
Last night, I stopped by
to see if they were home.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.500
And what did you see?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.400
Heather Crowley.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.600
The babysitter.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.800
Oh, she was...

10:45.800 --> 10:47.000
(chuckles)

10:47.000 --> 10:48.900
...she was doing a lot more
than babysitting.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.000
Believe me.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.600
Well, I guess we'll see
if that checks out.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.500
(chuckles):
Come on, really?

11:06.100 --> 11:08.000
You're honestly
looking at me for this?

11:08.300 --> 11:09.700
I honestly am.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.500
have been really
difficult on you.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.100
But you've got to tell me
the truth, okay?

11:24.300 --> 11:25.500
I was alone.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.900
I swear.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.700
Heather, we have
an eyewitness

11:28.700 --> 11:30.400
that tells us
something different.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.300
The man in the window?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.400
Yeah. He, uh...

11:37.000 --> 11:39.600
he claims that you were
in a state of, uh...

11:40.900 --> 11:42.000
undress.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.500
Do you want to tell me
what you were doing?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
I know I wasn't supposed to,

11:50.300 --> 11:52.700
but I was trying on
Mrs. Montavo's clothes.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.500
(bushes rustling)

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
She shops at all
the high-end stores.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.500
I'm sorry.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.400
Excuse me one second.

12:12.200 --> 12:12.800
Hey.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
How're you doing?
Good. What's up?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.899
Patrol radioed in.
They just picked up

12:16.900 --> 12:18.500
Dave and Renee Montavo.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.000
Okay, thanks.
Yeah.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.400
Is Justin okay?

12:30.700 --> 12:33.200
He's in good hands.
He's with Child Services.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.300
Can we take him home?

12:35.400 --> 12:37.700
Right after you tell me
what you did last night.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.300
Actually, um...

12:42.900 --> 12:44.700
we passed out in our car.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.700
She drank too much.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.000
I drank? Excuse me?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.400
You couldn't even
stand up straight.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.799
Oh, no,
I was the designated driver.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.900
All I had was
orange juice.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.900
Orange juice and God
knows what else he had.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.100
Please answer the question.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.600
Truth is, Lieutenant,
we don't know what happened.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.299
We went to a party
at our neighbor's house,

13:06.300 --> 13:07.300
Oliver Brenner.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.100
Afterwards, we just blacked out.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.599
CAINE:
Okay, let me get
this straight.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.799
A double murder
occurs in your home,

13:15.800 --> 13:18.300
and you're claiming you were
blacked out in your car.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.100
I realize how this looks.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.300
I'm not sure that you do.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.900
I'm going to need
the address to that party.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.700
WOMAN:
I need these tables
in the truck now.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.800
We have a wedding
in Biscayne tonight.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.300
??I'm here about
a murder investigation.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.099
Oh, um, I don't know what
goes on at the parties,

13:44.100 --> 13:45.600
I just plan them.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.100
Do you know anything
about the glasses

13:47.100 --> 13:48.299
that were used
at last night's event?

13:48.300 --> 13:50.799
I know that I need
to have them washed
and in Biscayne by 4:00.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.900
So they haven't been cleaned?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.500
No, we do
that at base.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.400
Not today.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.899
They're evidence
in a murder investigation.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.500
I'm going to be taking
them all with me.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.299
I'm going to need the
backup stemware.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.699
Ivan!
I'm also going to need

14:01.700 --> 14:04.299
a list of everyone that was
at that party last night.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.100
I will give you
whatever you need.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.000
Just keep my company's
name out of it.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, I'll try my best.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.000
CAINE:
So what did we get
on the Montavos?

14:26.000 --> 14:26.800
Well, I printed
everything

14:26.800 --> 14:27.900
from the Brenner party,

14:28.200 --> 14:30.600
and I did find the
Montavos' drinking glasses.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.100
But both their blood-alcohol
tests cameack negative,

14:33.100 --> 14:34.500
so they didn't have
much to drink.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.300
Okay. But that doesn't mean
they weren't dosed, does it?

15:07.600 --> 15:08.500
Two for two.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.400
Positive for GHB.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.100
Makes sense.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.700
<i>BOA VISTA:
GHB hits the brain fast,</i>

15:17.800 --> 15:21.000
<i>the body metabolizes it
as oxygen and carbon dioxide.</i>

15:21.500 --> 15:22.700
<i>Leaves no trace behind.
</i>

15:28.800 --> 15:30.499
<i>That mixed even
with a little bit of alcohol,</i>

15:30.500 --> 15:32.000
would knock them out completely.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.600
So the Montavos are telling the truth?

15:36.500 --> 15:40.400
See, if you ask me, 
someone did not want them to come home last night.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.400
Oh, my gosh. You took
the entire window.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.900
Oh, yeah.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.100
You know, I was figuring
that the only reason why you

16:06.200 --> 16:09.000
would drug the Montavo
family is to rob them.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.700
Maybe the Crowleys
interrupted a bulary.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.800
Did you find anything?

16:12.800 --> 16:13.900
Yeah, hit the UV.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.199
(switch clicks)

16:15.200 --> 16:16.900
Take a look,
uh, right here.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.000
What is that?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.100
I don't know, so I'm running it
through the FTIR now.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.700
(machine whirs)

16:27.100 --> 16:29.299
You know what, this stuff is
on the inside of the window.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.100
Someone wanted out, not in.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.399
Well, it's, uh,
benzoyl peroxide

16:34.400 --> 16:35.800
and sodium carbomer.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.500
Is that some kind of antiaging-
antiwrinkle type cream?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.900
Think younger-- benzoyl
peroxide is for acne.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.100
You mean the kid.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.400
Maybe he was trying to
sneak out of the house.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.500
Yeah, gives him the perfect
window of opportunity.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.300
He wasn't at the party,
so he couldn't have
spiked the drinks.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.200
Hey. I just got the guest list
from the party planner.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.900
Anybody we'd be interested in?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.100
Dr. Mike Lasker.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.799
Looks like it's
time to make

16:58.800 --> 17:00.600
another appointment
with the doctor.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.900
Dr. Lasker,

17:05.099 --> 17:06.300
you lied to me.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.500
Lied about what?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.800
Witnesses can put you
at the Brenner party,

17:10.900 --> 17:12.700
and that's a lie
by omission.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.200
Dave Montavo is a thief.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.999
The guy stole from me.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.800
Do you have anything
to back that up?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.900
After every party,
things go missing

17:25.000 --> 17:26.099
from the host's house.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.099
Not two weeks ago,
I had a pay.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.900
Last weekend, my house was hit.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.900
How did you know
it was Montavo?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.799
He's always nosing
around your stuff
wanting to know

17:35.800 --> 17:37.200
how valuable it is.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.900
Kept asking me about
my '69 World Series ball.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.199
Last weekend, it was gone.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.500
So you went to the party
and dosed their drinks?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.400
I didn't want this
to get out of hand.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.800
Yes, well,
it's far too late for that.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
Okay... truth?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.800
Uh-huh.
I slipped a safe amount

17:59.800 --> 18:01.100
of GHB into their drinks.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.799
I just needed time
to search their place.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.399
Or to commit a double murder.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.600
No, I needed to be certain
before I pointed the finger.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.000
Yes, well, that finger

18:11.500 --> 18:13.000
is now pointing at you.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.500
(indistinct radio transmission)

18:22.000 --> 18:23.300
The Crowleys are dead
and you show up

18:23.400 --> 18:24.900
with a warrant
to search my house?

18:25.200 --> 18:25.999
What is this for?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.600
The warrant's
for stolen property.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.400
Could be motive
for a double murder.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.700
DAVE:
Wait, what?

18:31.900 --> 18:33.400
That's ridiculous.

18:34.100 --> 18:34.800
When was the last time
you were

18:34.800 --> 18:36.599
at Dr. Lasker's
residence?

18:36.600 --> 18:40.100
Uh... it was a few weeks ago.
Mike had a party.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.300
Half the neighborhood
was there.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.199
You people seem to like
to party around here.
Lieutenant,

18:44.200 --> 18:47.100
we don't understand.
What does this have to
do with the Crowleys?

18:47.100 --> 18:49.400
There have been
allegations of a theft.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.800
DAVE:
We haven't stolen anything.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.900
Hey, did you get something?

18:55.900 --> 18:56.600
H!

19:00.400 --> 19:01.799
Hey, you can't just...

19:01.800 --> 19:03.100
tear up my house.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.600
(clattering)

19:10.200 --> 19:12.100
Signed baseball. It's, uh...

19:12.900 --> 19:14.000
Miracle Mets.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.900
Just like Lasker said.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.800
DAVE:
I swear neither of us

19:17.900 --> 19:19.300
knew that that was there.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.200
There's also
a Rolex Professional in here

19:22.300 --> 19:24.100
which was reported
missing last night

19:24.200 --> 19:25.300
by one of your neighbors.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
Last night?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.799
When we were both unconscious.
You see?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.599
We had nothing to do with this.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.400
Mr. Montavo, where's your son?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
You've been sneaking
out of the house, Justin.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.600
No way.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.400
I didn't go anywhere.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.599
Evidence that we recovered
from the window

19:43.600 --> 19:44.900
says you have.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.800
Okay,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.800
so maybe I snuck
out a few times.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.000
We found your stash
in the heating duct,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.099
which means
you've been stealing

19:59.100 --> 20:00.400
from your neighbors.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.700
Justin...

20:14.200 --> 20:15.200
I need your help.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.000
I wasn't the only one
doing someing bad.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.500
How do you mean, son?

20:24.600 --> 20:25.900
My babysitter, Heather,

20:26.300 --> 20:27.700
she had a guy over.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.400
What guy?
Her boyfriend.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.100
Doesn't that help?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.100
You know what, Justin?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.900
I think it might.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.800
I was alone.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.000
I swear.

20:44.200 --> 20:44.800
Heather...

20:46.700 --> 20:48.000
don't add to your tragedy

20:48.100 --> 20:49.500
by trying to protect
someone else.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.800
Believe me, it's not worth it.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.800
Now, we know someone
was there with you.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.200
Okay. So I had someone over.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.400
But no one was
supposed to know.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.500
And why was that?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.100
'Cause of my parents.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.400
They don't like him.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.300
They didn't
want us together.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.600
Listen to me, Heather.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.600
I'm going to need the name
of your boyfriend.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.400
Give me the phone.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.100
Come on. Give it to me.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.900
Zach Griffith.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.800
You can take her.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.500
Thank you.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.400
(phone dialing)

22:00.400 --> 22:01.600
Is this Zach Griffith?
Zach Griffith?

22:01.900 --> 22:02.699
Who is this?

22:02.700 --> 22:04.500
Zach, my name is Ryan Wolfe.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.000
I'm with Miami-Dade
Police Department.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.200
I want you to come down
here and talk to us.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.100
Why would I do that?

22:09.500 --> 22:12.000
Because, Zach, I'm investigating
a double homicide.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.500
Now do you want to come down...
(slams cell phone shut)

22:21.600 --> 22:23.500
<i>MAN:
Zach Griffith spotted
on Eighth and Collins.</i>

22:23.500 --> 22:24.499
<i>Suspect is fleeing.</i>

22:24.500 --> 22:25.800
<i>Pursuit in progress.</i>

22:26.100 --> 22:27.600
(sirens blaring)

22:27.700 --> 22:30.300
(engine revving)

22:31.800 --> 22:33.100
(tires squealing)

22:36.600 --> 22:39.000
(sirens blaring)

22:45.100 --> 22:47.000
(tires squealing)

22:47.100 --> 22:50.500
(engine revving)

22:54.500 --> 22:55.900
(tires squealing)

22:58.600 --> 23:01.600
(metal and glass clattering)

23:01.700 --> 23:04.400
(indistinct radio transmission)

23:05.900 --> 23:06.900
MAN:
Don't move!

23:07.000 --> 23:07.999
Stay exactly
where you are.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.400
Zach Griffith,
you're under arrest.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.000
For what?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.900
Felony fleeing and eluding.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
But if I had
to put my money down,

23:15.700 --> 23:17.200
I would add a charge of murder.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.140
We just wanted
to bring you in

23:32.140 --> 23:34.340
as a witness,
and you ran.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.940
Well, I-I freaked, you know?

23:36.940 --> 23:37.840
I'm sorry.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.740
I knowou and Heather
were having sex.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.540
So?

23:47.340 --> 23:49.039
Is that why
you killed the Crowleys,

23:49.040 --> 23:50.340
because they caught you
together?

23:53.440 --> 23:55.640
Okay, here...
here's what happened.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.240
I was with Heather last night.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.640
She was babysitting.

23:59.140 --> 24:01.940
I tried to sneak out the back,
and-and her dad jumped me.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.640
(crickets chirping)

24:04.740 --> 24:06.640
Look, I know
you're sleeping with her.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.539
Stay away from her.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.340
Hey, if you can't control
her, it's not my problem.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.639
You know what I
can't figure out

24:12.640 --> 24:15.240
is how you mustered up all
the force to kill him.

24:15.540 --> 24:17.040
You keep saying kill him.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.840
I didn't kill anybody.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.539
Her dad got in my face, and so,
I pumped it out of there.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.340
Zach, if you're lying
to me, I'll find out.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.340
It's what I do.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.440
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

24:29.540 --> 24:30.440
No.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.040
Next time I won't
be so understanding.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.440
??

25:07.940 --> 25:08.539
Maybe.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.539
I just took a closer
look at the insects

25:10.540 --> 25:11.740
in Mr. Crowley's wound,

25:11.740 --> 25:13.039
and there are
no blowflies.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.239
There are only
houseflies.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.740
Houseflies aren't
from decomp.
Exactly.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.340
But I'm thinking they might
still give us a timeline.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.240
How's that?

25:20.440 --> 25:22.440
Wmll, houseflies are
dormant at night.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.439
<i>So maybe Mr. Crowley
was attacked
</i>

25:24.440 --> 25:25.740
earlier than we thought?

25:26.040 --> 25:26.739
Yeah, but that's not all.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.440
Come take a look
at this micro view.

25:34.040 --> 25:34.640
DUQUESNE:
Hmm.

25:35.340 --> 25:36.839
Wings, legs,
but no thorax.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.940
Mm-hmm,

25:37.940 --> 25:40.740
which means  they were hit by something
with a lot of force.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.340
or someone...

25:43.740 --> 25:45.540
(buzzing)

25:45.540 --> 25:47.040
(whack)

25:47.140 --> 25:50.640
Well, the average punch
is under 20 miles an hour,

25:50.640 --> 25:53.139
so to make an insect
look like this,

25:53.140 --> 25:55.540
they'd have to be hit by
a force of at least 40.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.039
So if it was someone,

25:57.040 --> 25:59.340
we're looking
for a very strong man.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.340
I was drugged
at a party last night.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.140
I... There's no way??

26:06.140 --> 26:08.040
WOLFE:
You were a boxer
in college.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.740
I bet you can still
pack a punch.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.240
I-I was. It was years ago.

26:13.340 --> 26:14.540
BOA VISTA:
Well, as it turns out,

26:14.540 --> 26:17.340
we think that Mr. Crowley   may have been
murdered

26:17.340 --> 26:19.140
beforwe??

26:19.640 --> 26:20.940
I was at work all day.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
WOLFE:
What about you
and Mrs. Crowley,

26:23.040 --> 26:23.840
your neighbor?

26:25.440 --> 26:26.240
What about her?

26:26.940 --> 26:27.439
(laughs)

26:27.440 --> 26:28.840
Just hoW nghborly were you?

26:29.740 --> 26:30.839
What are you talking about?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.239
Were you having an affair
with her?
I didn't kill anyone.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.940
And I'm not cheating
on my wife.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.540
We'd like you
to prove it.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.540
Ho

26:41.340 --> 26:42.840
I'd like to take your DNA.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.040
Do you have a problem with that?

26:46.240 --> 26:47.440
Do what you got to do.

26:53.240 --> 26:53.940
Open up.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.339
BOA VISTA:
Hey.

27:02.340 --> 27:03.340
You having any luck

27:03.340 --> 27:04.940
identifying all
these stolen items?

27:05.440 --> 27:06.640
Well, besides the baseball,

27:06.640 --> 27:09.340
everything was reported stolen
from the neighborhood.

27:09.740 --> 27:10.740
Except this.

27:11.740 --> 27:12.540
Let's see.

27:14.540 --> 27:15.640
Wow, that's a beauty.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.240
Someone's definitely
missing it.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.440
I can tell you who.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.640
Yeah? What you got?

27:19.740 --> 27:21.840
Bracelet popped up on a theft report,

27:21.840 --> 27:23.340
but not
from around the neighborhood.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.140
Call came out
of Golden Beach.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.540
There's the case number.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.440
Golden Beach? That's miles
from Coconut Grove.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.039
Yeah.
It doesn't fit
the pattern

27:31.040 --> 27:32.640
of a 12-year-old
kleptomaniac.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.940
(computer beeps and trills)

27:38.632 --> 27:40.632
Why would the Montavos have it?

27:40.632 --> 27:41.172
That's a good question.

27:41.684 --> 27:43.332
Horatio's go

27:43.432 --> 27:43.935
Why the daughter?

27:44.730 --> 27:46.530
The original owner,
Lucille Clarke, died last month.

27:47.237 --> 27:48.530
Her daughter, Amelia,
is on her way in.

27:57.010 --> 27:57.430
CAINE:
Miss Clarke?

28:02.430 --> 28:03.730
Thank you for coming in.

28:03.730 --> 28:05.030
Thank you
for calling.

28:05.030 --> 28:06.530
Mother's bracelet means

28:07.738 --> 28:08.486
the world to me.

28:10.236 --> 28:11.470
Is that her bracelet?

28:15.730 --> 28:18.128
Dad gave it to her
when they were first mared.

28:19.237 --> 28:20.728
Had no business spending
that kind of money,

28:20.729 --> 28:21.851
he used to say.

28:22.693 --> 28:24.666
But he just... had to.

28:26.686 --> 28:27.425
Can I keep it?

28:28.030 --> 28:31.230
As soon as I clear this
up, you can keep it, okay?

28:32.956 --> 28:34.505
I need to know
how she lost it.

28:35.735 --> 28:38.589
My mom never took it off.

28:41.709 --> 28:42.930
Even when she got si

28:58.519 --> 29:00.249
that's when it was stolen.

29:04.392 --> 29:05.610
Dr. Mike Lasker.

29:07.372 --> 29:08.327
Do you know him?

29:09.905 --> 29:10.883
As a matter of fact, I do.

29:21.230 --> 29:24.430
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.
Dr. Forrest...

29:25.280 --> 29:27.130
Lieutenant Caine,
I'm in the middle

29:27.230 --> 29:29.330
of rounds, so I only

29:29.430 --> 29:30.930
Did you find my baseball?

29:31.030 --> 29:32.437
As a matter of fact, we did.

29:33.568 --> 29:36.151
Along the way,
we stumbled onto this.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.130
Do you recognize
that bracelet?

29:40.114 --> 29:41.429
Yes, it belonged
to, uh, Lucille Clarke.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.682
She was a patient of mine.

29:43.701 --> 29:44.530
She wanted me to have it.

29:45.142 --> 29:45.722
Interesting.

29:45.830 --> 29:48.030
Not according
to her daughter.

29:48.635 --> 29:51.329
Well, maybe Mrs. Clarke
didn't have time to tell her.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.130
She died a month ago.

29:53.230 --> 29:55.628
I'm happy to return it
to theamily.

29:55.930 --> 29:57.130
That won't be necessary.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.230
Dr. Lasker, have you
ever received a gift

29:59.330 --> 30:00.647
from another patient?

30:03.074 --> 30:03.867
Lieutenant Caine...

30:05.805 --> 30:07.179
I've done nothing wrong.

30:08.331 --> 30:09.830
Investigate mell you want.

30:18.985 --> 30:19.730
TRIPP:
Horatio?

30:21.598 --> 30:23.505
I looked into the good doctor
like you asked.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.029
And what did you get, Frank?

30:25.030 --> 30:26.930
Dr. Mike Lasker--
it's his third job

30:27.030 --> 30:28.130
ins many years.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.430
He's mad

30:29.430 --> 30:31.230
the Georgia and Louisiana
state medical boards.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.530
And let me guess.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.530
Where other patients
died under his care.

30:34.630 --> 30:35.830
Try six.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.530
One family cried malpractice,

30:37.630 --> 30:40.418
but the aupsy confirmed
death by respiratory failure.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.185
Doesn't mean
it was natural, does it?

30:42.230 --> 30:44.030
I'm thinking serial killer.

30:44.130 --> 30:46.930
The good doctor goes in,
kills them, takes his trophies

30:47.030 --> 30:49.130
before the families
can claim the bodies.

30:49.230 --> 30:51.686
Mrs. Clarke was his most
recent victim, wasn't she?

30:52.181 --> 30:52.439
Yeah.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.130
He went to the Montavo house

30:54.130 --> 30:56.330
to steal back the only thing
that could tie him to the crime.

30:56.330 --> 30:59.430
Yes, but we beat him to it.

32:00.438 --> 32:03.380
You, uh... wanted me
to bring my kit.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.680
Why, what's up?

32:05.204 --> 32:06.380
Well, the babysitter

32:06.480 --> 32:08.080
was lying,
and I'm just trying

32:08.080 --> 32:10.122
to figure out if she's
covering for Mr. Montavo.

32:10.999 --> 32:12.880
By going over my
evidence reports?

32:13.264 --> 32:15.067
I'm just making sure
that we crossed all our Ts.

32:17.182 --> 32:19.693
I swabbed the babysitter for
blood, and she's clean.

32:21.857 --> 32:22.880
So, if there's a
confidence issue, Calleigh,

32:22.980 --> 32:23.844
why don't you
just say so?

32:25.921 --> 32:27.080
You're recovering
from a brain injury.

32:27.180 --> 32:30.180
I don't think it hurts anybody
to be absolutely certain.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.661
I know I've been a
little slow lately.

32:33.978 --> 32:35.860
I've had to
relearn the basics.

32:37.081 --> 32:37.780
For a lot of things.

32:39.079 --> 32:40.380
But I do them all
step-by-step,

32:40.480 --> 32:41.405
and I get
em right.

32:45.572 --> 32:46.380
I'm looking at these reports,

32:46.480 --> 32:48.380
and your phenolphthalein test
is out of order.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.623
Well, that can't be.

32:51.679 --> 32:52.869
I need to see your kit.

33:14.950 --> 33:16.180
Do you normally keep
these reagents

33:16.280 --> 33:17.580
in order of application?

33:17.580 --> 33:18.624
Yeah, of course.

33:20.824 --> 33:21.825
Then I think we have a problem.

33:26.768 --> 33:29.180
The peroxide and the water
are switched,

33:29.180 --> 33:30.879
which creates a false negative.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.318
No. That can't be.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.680
You've got, um...

33:37.517 --> 33:39.869
H2O... H2O2.

33:41.362 --> 33:42.968
It's a really easy mistake.

33:47.156 --> 33:47.637
It's a big one.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.689
I wouldn't have done that.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.511
You did.

34:00.422 --> 34:01.967
We may have lost our shot
at the killer.

34:03.653 --> 34:05.155
We need to figure out
how to get this guy.

34:11.179 --> 34:11.909
BOA VISTA:
What are you doing?

34:12.460 --> 34:14.000
Going over all of the
evidence I handled today.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.399
I feel horrible.
I really messed up.

34:18.368 --> 34:19.485
You're still recovering, Eric.

34:20.864 --> 34:23.427
I messed up today, and I
don't even have an excuse.

34:23.981 --> 34:24.780
What did you do?

34:24.880 --> 34:27.380
I was so busy looking
at insect evidence,

34:27.480 --> 34:29.587
that I completely missed
the bigger picture.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.480
What do you mean?

34:32.580 --> 34:33.980
The fly that we found
in Mr. Crowley's wound

34:34.080 --> 34:35.371
was hit at a high velocity.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.817
But his head doesn't
show signifint impact.

34:38.652 --> 34:41.733
How was the man going at one
speed, and the fly at another?

34:41.780 --> 34:44.391
I think the killer used a weapon
that had a dead fly on it.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.031
And then it was transferred.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.080
Well, it dsn't
make sense.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.580
I know my math was right,

34:48.580 --> 34:51.080
so whatever hit that fly was
going at least 40 miles an hour.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.480
Like a car windshield.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.663
Or a motorcycle helmet.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.480
(engine revs)

35:05.480 --> 35:08.280
(sighs)

35:12.925 --> 35:13.426
DUQUESNE:
Are you ready?

35:13.988 --> 35:14.874
I'm not going in.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.213
Come on. It'll be good
for your confidence.

35:18.335 --> 35:20.247
No, you were right.
I made a rookie mistake.

35:21.548 --> 35:23.680
Hey, you were the one who
figured out the murder weapon.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.280
You were the one
who broke the case.

35:27.086 --> 35:28.340
I came back too soon.

35:34.209 --> 35:36.886
All right.
I'll go this one alone.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.755
But we can't make it
without you.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.480
What do you want now?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.380
Really?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.080
How about this.

35:54.180 --> 35:55.880
I ld you I'd figure
it out and I did.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.780
I know how you killed

35:57.880 --> 35:59.480
What do you mean?

36:00.435 --> 36:02.890
We found traces of his DNA
on your motorcycle helmet.

36:05.656 --> 36:06.580
Okay. So I hit him.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.924
It wasn't my fault, though,
he attacked me.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.823
I know you're sleeping
with her. Stay away from her.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.080
If it was self-defense,

36:27.180 --> 36:28.580
how come you killed
Heather's mom?

36:29.989 --> 36:30.633
I didn't.

36:30.946 --> 36:31.968
You lied to me
about one murder.

36:32.080 --> 36:32.882
Don't lie to me again.

36:36.678 --> 36:38.132
Aren't I supposed to, like,
get a lawyer or something?

36:40.185 --> 36:41.228
If that's your request.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.183
It is.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.803
Hey.
Hey.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.460
Just finished the post
on Kimberly Crowley.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.139
Got some physical findings.

36:55.938 --> 36:57.080
You ran a
sexual assault kit?

36:57.209 --> 36:58.850
Yeah, found some minor tearing.

36:59.180 --> 37:01.550
Indication of recent
sexual intercourse.

37:01.580 --> 37:03.380
Okay. I'll, um...

37:03.480 --> 37:04.899
run it against the husband.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.699
And all the parties
on that block, honey,

37:07.080 --> 37:09.880
I'd run it against
the tire neighborhood.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.380
Well, whatever it takes.

37:40.689 --> 37:42.433
Hey, did you call?
Yeah.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.880
I found a very
interesting DNA match

37:44.980 --> 37:47.682
from the sexual examination
on the babysitter's mom.

37:51.711 --> 37:53.397
The neighborhood
just got kinkier.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.886
Yeah.

37:59.675 --> 38:00.422
Well, Heather...

38:00.880 --> 38:02.976
we know that your boyfriend
killed your dad.

38:04.363 --> 38:05.280
Why don't you, uh...

38:05.380 --> 38:06.852
why don't you
tell us the rest?

38:07.180 --> 38:08.876
No, I can't do that to him.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.383
Him?

38:12.207 --> 38:13.980
I was talking about you.
What?

38:14.080 --> 38:15.680
I di't have any blood on me.

38:15.780 --> 38:17.380
Your officer cleared me
this morning.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.466
Well, that's because
you washed your hands

38:19.780 --> 38:20.861
after you stabbed your mom.

38:22.980 --> 38:23.882
What do you mean?

38:25.231 --> 38:26.045
Lift up your shirt.

38:29.442 --> 38:30.279
Go ahead, lift up your shirt.

38:41.922 --> 38:43.051
You could never understand.
你不會明白

38:45.471 --> 38:46.836
This has to do with Zach,
doesn't it?

38:47.980 --> 38:51.478
We recovered evidence
that he and your mother

38:50.180 --> 38:52.080
had sex last night.

38:52.180 --> 38:55.280
I couldn't believe my mom would
do that with my boyfriend.

38:55.931 --> 38:57.995
When did you find out?
Last night.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.722
I thought my dad and Zach
were fighting about me.

39:04.513 --> 39:06.180
Look, I know you're sleeping
with her.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.680
Stay away from her.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.780
ZACH:
Hey, if you can't control
her, it's not my problem.

39:16.173 --> 39:17.280
Oh, he fou
the card you gave me.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.580
I tried to stop him.

39:18.680 --> 39:19.665
Baby, are you okay?

39:20.180 --> 39:20.941
Kim, not now.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.706
No, it's okay.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.580
Now we can be together.

39:25.773 --> 39:26.637
We don't have to worry.

39:27.181 --> 39:29.553
Mom? Are you and Zach...?

39:30.117 --> 39:30.752
Honey...

39:33.480 --> 39:36.633
I didn't want you to find
out this way. I'm sorry.

39:37.163 --> 39:38.036
Sorry?!

39:39.155 --> 39:40.538
Stay away from him!

39:40.480 --> 39:41.880
(screams)

39:47.486 --> 39:48.280
Oh, my God.

39:49.516 --> 39:51.450
You didn see me,
and I didn see you.

40:03.691 --> 40:05.883
Status on Mrs. Clae, please.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.249
Our exhumed body?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.896
Lucille Clarke was positive
for pancuronium.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.178
Which mimics
respiratory failure.

40:12.650 --> 40:14.020
The doctor was smart.

40:13.780 --> 40:15.980
Or so he would think.

40:28.179 --> 40:30.068
Sir, I think we've got
something over here.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.080
CAINE:
Three states, seven victims.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.156
You've got quite a body of work,
Dr. Lasker.

40:40.927 --> 40:42.566
Every doctor loses patients.

40:43.430 --> 40:46.404
These patients lost their
lives to a serial killer-- you.

40:47.522 --> 40:49.542
Please. You don't
believe that.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.980
Lucille Clarke...

40:52.292 --> 40:53.851
was killed by this drug.

41:00.303 --> 41:02.080
I took the oath to help people,

41:02.764 --> 41:03.747
save them from suffering.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.137
You ended their lives.

41:05.780 --> 41:08.550
They were all terminally ill,
on life support.

41:08.580 --> 41:11.480
You stole from them and then
murdered them, Dr. Lasker.

41:11.877 --> 41:13.633
I gave them their dignity.

41:14.580 --> 41:17.682
Their families were merely
postponing the inevitable.

41:17.910 --> 41:22.054
Dr. Lasker,
the inevitable has arrived.
