[whimpers]

Retreat!

01:38.515 --> 01:40.558
Cool your jets, Peej.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.894
Max, we've gotta regroup!

01:42.977 --> 01:44.145
No, we don't.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.980
We got him where we want him.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.400
We got-- Oh, yeah.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.486
Come on out, general.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.071
We gotcha cold.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.824
[scoffs] Guess he's gonna go down
with the garbage, huh?

01:55.907 --> 01:59.077
Eh! The military mind is a mystery to me.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.203
You ready?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.496
I'm ready.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.998
Aha! Gotcha, general!

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
Don't move, Uncle Bob!

02:06.876 --> 02:09.295
[yelping]

02:09.379 --> 02:12.215
That's-- that's impossible.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.800
[P.J.] How'd he do that?

Ha ha! Surprise is my middle name!

02:22.100 --> 02:23.518
Come on, Peejster!

02:23.601 --> 02:26.396
We have not yet begun to squirt.

[man on TV]
This 4th of July, come on down.

02:28.857 --> 02:32.444
Get a super deal on a patriotic RV
from me, Earl Yokel.

02:32.527 --> 02:37.532
[munching] Earl Yokel?
Yokel Earl, you mean.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.410
You can't get a better deal
in Spoonerville,

02:40.493 --> 02:43.705
especially from a certain RV pirate

02:43.788 --> 02:46.374
whose initial is "p" as in porky.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.876
What?

02:47.959 --> 02:48.960
"P"?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.086
Why, that's me!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.422
Who you calling porky, bird face?

02:52.505 --> 02:54.090
And if he's watching

02:54.174 --> 02:56.593
and can stop chewing long enough
to listen,

02:56.676 --> 02:59.179
I challenge him to outsell me,

02:59.262 --> 03:00.805
Earl "Uncle Sam" Yokel,

03:00.889 --> 03:04.559
during my 4th of July
red, white, and blue tag sale.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.061
[woman] I want one!

03:06.144 --> 03:07.604
[people chattering] What a great deal!

03:07.687 --> 03:09.689
This means war!

03:09.773 --> 03:12.192
I've gotta develop a gimmick

03:12.275 --> 03:13.860
to outsell that loudmouth.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.862
First I'll figure out a way

03:15.945 --> 03:18.823
to get the air out of his tires.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.949
[P.J.] Move it, Max!

03:20.033 --> 03:21.534
[Max] Right behind you, bud.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.706
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

03:26.790 --> 03:29.793
Uncle Bob's teaching us
commando tactics.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.253
The guy's amazing. He could be anywhere!

03:32.337 --> 03:34.089
That old blowhard?

03:34.172 --> 03:37.550
Why, he couldn't commando my big toe!

03:37.634 --> 03:38.510
[blows raspberry]

03:38.593 --> 03:40.261
It's him.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.262
Let 'em have it!

03:41.346 --> 03:43.473
Let who have what?

03:47.811 --> 03:49.604
Don't move, general.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.606
I gotcha, Uncle Bob.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.234
Hold on just a second there.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.779
It ain't over till it's over, rookies!

04:00.281 --> 04:02.117
Stop it!

04:02.200 --> 04:05.036
He who squirts and runs away

04:05.120 --> 04:08.123
lives to squirt another day.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.541
After him!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.042
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

04:12.210 --> 04:14.170
When I get my hands on those kids--

04:14.254 --> 04:15.296
I'm gonna-- Uh?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.340
Where do we think we're going?

04:17.424 --> 04:21.177
Why, pumpkin nut, we-- I mean, you--

04:21.261 --> 04:23.179
I was just--

04:23.263 --> 04:25.682
Redecorating to surprise Mommy?

04:25.765 --> 04:29.561
[Pete] Uh, well, not exactly,
sardine lips,

04:29.644 --> 04:31.021
see, I was just--

04:31.104 --> 04:32.731
You really want to surprise Mommy,

04:32.814 --> 04:34.441
you'll clean up, now!

04:34.524 --> 04:36.901
But, Pegster, I didn't do it.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.945
It was your uncle--

04:39.029 --> 04:41.948
Easy. That's my favorite ear.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.492
You just leave my sweet uncle Bob alone!

04:44.784 --> 04:50.081
It isn't easy for Brigadier General
Robert E. Lee Sparrowhawk to retire.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.543
He's acting a little strange
'cause he's feeling useless.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.045
But he has a good heart.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.630
It's his head I'm worried about.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.299
Did you say something?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.926
I was just saying he wasn't alone

05:02.010 --> 05:05.263
because P.J. and young goof--

05:05.305 --> 05:07.682
Yes. The kids just love him, don't they?

05:07.766 --> 05:09.768
Don't forget to dust my knickknacks.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.563
But-- But I got work to do.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.900
Earl Yokel's commercials
are killing my business.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.735
I'll have to go to war.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.571
Why, Pete, my little hot-glue gun,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.865
that's so thoughtful of you.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.076
It... is?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.119
Uncle Bob will be a big help

05:28.203 --> 05:30.789
planning your ad campaign with you.

05:30.872 --> 05:35.377
Uncle Bob? Helping me sell RVs?

05:37.253 --> 05:41.007
It isn't like you
to have such a good idea. [laughs]

05:41.091 --> 05:43.385
I can't wait to tell Uncle Bob.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.845
Uh, let me tell him, Peg!

05:45.929 --> 05:50.058
I, uh, I wanna see his face
light up with joy.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.018
Why, of course, Pete.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.895
Never mind cleaning up.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.941
Oh! I'm so excited about this!

05:58.024 --> 06:01.111
Long as that pinhead
uncle of hers is around,

06:01.194 --> 06:02.570
I'm not going to get anything done.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.742
How do you get rid of a guy

06:07.826 --> 06:10.328
who only takes orders
from the US Army?

06:10.412 --> 06:15.583
Yeah! That's it! Orders from the army.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.758
[Goofy]
Hmm. Let's see here.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.885
Instructions in Spanish, German,

06:25.969 --> 06:28.471
French, Dutch, Italian...

06:28.596 --> 06:30.390
Ah! Here we go!

06:30.473 --> 06:32.142
Instructions in English!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.352
[chuckles] These oughta do it.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.604
[narrator]
Plumbing in the home.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.649
Chapter one--
the kitchen sink.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.361
Nothing is easier than disconnecting
the kitchen sink

06:43.445 --> 06:46.531
for its annual cleaning and inspection.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.533
I love this stuff!

06:48.616 --> 06:50.952
First, select your pipe wrench.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.621
I said pipe wrench!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.291
[Goofy] Oh! Silly ol' me!

06:56.374 --> 06:59.169
[narrator]
Now unscrew the p-trapfrom the tail piece

06:59.252 --> 07:00.628
while untwisting the y-joint

07:00.712 --> 07:02.088
playing tea for two

07:02.172 --> 07:04.090
on the left-hand threaded elbow.

07:04.174 --> 07:08.011
[Goofy laughs] This is a cinch. Uh-oh.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.013
But whatever you do,

07:10.096 --> 07:13.516
don't forget to shut off the water!

07:13.975 --> 07:16.186
[screaming]

07:17.937 --> 07:20.231
Gosh, General Sparrowhawk,

07:20.315 --> 07:21.691
you're really something.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.027
Thank you, Max.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.362
Call me Bob.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.031
And you're right. I really am something.

07:28.114 --> 07:32.827
Man, I don't know why
the army let you retire.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.788
Yeah! What a waste!

07:34.871 --> 07:36.414
You're awesome!

07:36.498 --> 07:38.291
The way I figure it,

07:38.375 --> 07:40.502
I'm being held in reserve

07:40.585 --> 07:43.254
for something really special.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.422
I must be.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.132
Get away from me!

07:46.216 --> 07:48.301
Am-scray! Beat it!

07:48.385 --> 07:49.678
I stand still for a second,

07:49.761 --> 07:51.846
and those vultures are all over me.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.181
I can't stand it!

07:53.264 --> 07:55.100
Now where was I?

07:55.183 --> 07:59.187
Tellin' us why the army was savin' you.
for something special.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.523
I'll tell you why, son.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.192
Because in all my years in the military,

08:04.776 --> 08:08.530
nothing and nobody
has ever taken me by surprise.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.866
Wow! Nobody's ever surprised you?

08:11.950 --> 08:13.034
Never.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.121
The man who finally does, if he exists,

08:16.204 --> 08:19.416
is gonna have to be someone very special.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.292
[Goofy screaming]

08:22.585 --> 08:25.588
Sorry, officer. I shoulda watched

08:25.672 --> 08:27.173
which way I was being blasted.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.300
Don't apologize, man!

08:29.384 --> 08:31.386
You were incredible.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.721
I never thought I'd see the day

08:32.804 --> 08:35.557
I'd have my socks knocked off like that.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.142
It was thrilling.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.437
You and I are gonna be buddies.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.606
But first, I have to get
out of this soggy uniform.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.233
I hate wet underwear.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.568
Who was that guy?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.153
My uncle!

08:48.236 --> 08:52.115
Brigadier General
Robert E. Lee Sparrowhawk,

08:52.198 --> 08:53.491
retired.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.660
I can believe it.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.996
I'm purty pooped myself.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.002
[whistles]

09:05.587 --> 09:06.880
Halt! Who goes there?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.842
Who in camouflage's
name are you?

09:10.925 --> 09:13.261
[Pete] Don't you recognize
military intelligence

09:13.345 --> 09:14.554
when you see it?

09:14.596 --> 09:15.972
If I could do that,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.515
I'd be a genius,
not a general.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.725
What do you want?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.311
I have a message for you from them.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.563
Wait a minute! What's the password?

09:23.646 --> 09:27.525
Uh, them didn't tell it to me.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.319
It was too secret.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.072
Exactly. They wouldn't
tell it to me, either.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.324
I love tight security.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.076
Now what's the message?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.244
[Pete] There's gonna be
a national emergency.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.205
They need you to handle it.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.751
I knew they were saving me
for something special!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.753
I just knew it. Didn't you?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.589
What kind of emergency
we talking about here?

09:49.673 --> 09:52.175
They say you'll know it when you see it.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.095
Of course I will.
I'm a trained soldier, you know?

09:55.178 --> 10:00.809
You'll have to organize
a base far from me-- I mean, here.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.644
What about extra troops?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.396
Use your own judgment.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.981
Wonderful! My very own judgment.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.150
I've discovered just the man I need

10:09.234 --> 10:11.611
right here--
a natural soldier,

10:11.695 --> 10:14.072
gave me the thrill of a lifetime.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.032
[Pete] Ain't that somethin'?

10:16.116 --> 10:19.452
You can count on Brigadier General
Bob Sparrowhawk.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.247
Roger, Wilco, and KP!

10:24.082 --> 10:27.502
Now that general moonbeam
is out of my face,

10:27.585 --> 10:30.255
I got a sales campaign to plan.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.923
Generals aren't the only ones

10:32.007 --> 10:33.425
who know how to stratify.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.760
Wait! Just a second, though, here.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.722
Fourth of July, generals, campaigns.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.559
I got it! Wait till that 4th of July jerk
Earl Yokel sees

10:42.642 --> 10:44.269
what he's up against now!

10:44.352 --> 10:46.146
[laughs menacingly]

10:51.026 --> 10:53.028
[Goofy] Doesn't look quite right somehow.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.364
Maybe I misread the instructions. [sighs]

10:56.448 --> 10:59.284
They're all Greek to me,
even the ones in English.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.786
[chuckles]
Sure could use a hand with these.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.705
[Bob] Psst! Hey, you! Soldier!

11:03.788 --> 11:06.082
Gawrsh!

11:06.166 --> 11:08.001
Not quite what I had in mind.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.211
No! No! Down here!

11:10.295 --> 11:12.172
Oh, hiya, general.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.423
You lost or something?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.008
Whoa!

11:15.091 --> 11:16.259
[Bob] Are we alone?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.802
[Goofy] I can't tell, general.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.390
It's too dark to see.
Hey! [mumbling]

11:23.141 --> 11:25.727
[screaming]

11:27.687 --> 11:28.730
[sighs]

11:28.813 --> 11:30.148
Private Goofy?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.399
Ah-hyuck! That's me.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.485
Uncle Bob wants you.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.530
This could be the moment you'll look back
on with pride for the rest of your life.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.032
What have you got to say?

11:39.115 --> 11:42.786
[Goofy] I think I forgot to turn
the water off again.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.871
[screams]

11:45.246 --> 11:47.624
[Pete] I was there.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.002
When Neanderthal man first
traded a stone wheel

11:51.086 --> 11:53.171
for a pork chop,

11:53.254 --> 11:54.756
I was there.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.925
When the first RV salesman

11:57.008 --> 12:01.096
sold a covered wagon with a leaky top

12:01.179 --> 12:02.806
and no warranty,

12:02.889 --> 12:04.391
I was there.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.143
And when Earl Yokel
learns the hard way

12:07.227 --> 12:12.816
what a 4th of July
RV sale is all about--

12:12.899 --> 12:14.317
ha ha ha--

12:14.401 --> 12:16.319
I'll be there, too.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.739
Now all I need is my tank.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.033
Nothin' like a little patriotism

12:22.117 --> 12:26.830
and an 88-millimetre cannon
to promote RV sales.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.208
Nice of ya to bring the boys.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.794
I always say, give me a man
when he's a boy,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.004
and when he's an old codger,

12:34.087 --> 12:37.716
the teenager will not forget the youth
when he isn't an infant anymore.

12:37.799 --> 12:42.721
Wow, if I'd said that,
my tongue would be numbly.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.764
Exactly where are we goin'?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.683
Yeah, and what are we gonna do?

12:46.766 --> 12:51.312
I can't tell you that now. Suffice to say
the world will be a better place

12:51.396 --> 12:52.355
when we're through.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.732
Radical!

12:53.815 --> 12:56.151
We're gonna hug trees.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.485
Cool!

12:57.569 --> 12:59.320
[Bob] Here we are!

12:59.404 --> 13:00.530
[tires screech]

13:01.156 --> 13:03.908
Welcome to the Spoonerville County
Militia Armory

13:03.992 --> 13:06.244
and surplus depot.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.747
[Max/P.J.] Awesome!

13:08.830 --> 13:11.332
I have the honor and privilege
of preparin' you

13:11.416 --> 13:13.501
for the oncoming emergency.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.961
Wow! An emergency!

13:15.045 --> 13:16.671
Right on!

13:16.755 --> 13:18.173
Yeah. Ah-hyuck!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.924
Exactly what kind of emergency

13:20.008 --> 13:21.926
are we talking about again?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.762
Don't you worry about that.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.474
I'll know it when I see it.
I'm a trained soldier.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.643
I can't wait to see him in action.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.145
And us in action, dude!

13:32.228 --> 13:33.396
[both] Yeah!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.899
The first thing you have to
learn is the basics

13:35.982 --> 13:37.609
from the army manual,

13:37.692 --> 13:40.445
then we'll move on to advanced training.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.489
[narrator]
Yes, it's true!

13:42.572 --> 13:44.366
You're in the army now!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.910
[chuckles] There's that voice again.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.454
Chapter one--
the obstacle course.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.831
Military efficiency is based

13:51.915 --> 13:54.209
on rigorous physical training.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.629
Overcoming physical challenges
takes speed,

13:57.712 --> 13:59.881
strength, and stamina.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.343
Of course, looking where
you're going helps, too.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.683
Only the finely-tuned body
can bring to bear

14:09.766 --> 14:13.311
that oh, so important
quality of agility!

14:13.395 --> 14:15.939
The long-awaited opportunity

14:16.022 --> 14:18.983
for our citizen soldier
to bring all his effort

14:19.067 --> 14:23.279
to bear on the accomplishment
of one mighty quest,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.949
surging spectacularly
to the heights

14:26.032 --> 14:27.867
of athletic prowess,

14:27.951 --> 14:29.369
which are utterly useless

14:29.452 --> 14:33.164
if the equipment hadn't been
properly checked beforehand.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.041
[Goofy screaming]

14:45.051 --> 14:47.595
[narrator]
Balance is another attribute

14:47.679 --> 14:49.931
demanded of military service.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.100
One never knows

14:52.183 --> 14:55.103
when a tiny, seemingly
insignificant misstep

14:55.186 --> 14:59.149
could send a soldier
catapulting to his doom.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.151
Too heavy [grunts]

15:01.234 --> 15:04.738
Successful balance requires
nerves of steel,

15:04.821 --> 15:06.281
catlike reflexes,

15:06.364 --> 15:07.907
and a stern resolution

15:07.991 --> 15:11.745
never, ever to be caught off-guard.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.123
[Goofy screaming]

15:17.083 --> 15:20.587
[Pete] Oh, baby, come to Papa.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.756
A super V-8 with glass packs,

15:22.839 --> 15:26.509
double-charged carbs,
24-valve mean machine.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
You're gonna be fun during rush hour.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.222
And to think this honey is obsolete.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.516
It's you and me, sweetie.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.353
Nothin' and nobody's stopping me

15:36.436 --> 15:38.605
from making you a star

15:38.688 --> 15:41.149
and selling a lot of RVs.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.276
[Goofy screaming]

15:49.699 --> 15:51.201
Hiya, Petey.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.994
Ah-hyuck! Nice catch.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.872
Goof, what in the name
of olive drab undies

15:55.955 --> 15:57.207
are you doin' here?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.626
[Bob] He's very good at surprisin' people.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.836
But the question is,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.047
what are you doin' here, nephew?

16:06.383 --> 16:08.718
Pete, why are you hanging
around here dressed

16:08.802 --> 16:11.137
like a boy scout
with delusions of grandeur?

16:11.221 --> 16:14.849
'Cause I need a tank
for my sales campaign!

16:14.933 --> 16:17.477
A likely story.
Why should I believe it?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.938
Because, Captain Kidd,

16:20.021 --> 16:22.816
you've believed everything else
I've told you.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.776
What's your dad talking about?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.778
I'm his kid, not his interpreter.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.822
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

16:28.947 --> 16:33.076
Peg wanted me to make General
Over-the-hill here feel useful,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.203
and it was driving me nutso!

16:36.329 --> 16:39.207
Not as long a drive
as you might suppose.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.420
So I convinced old
red, white, and blue-blood

16:43.503 --> 16:45.505
he was needed elsewhere.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.009
He thought I was
from military intelligence.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.428
Now that's a pretty scary concept.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.055
You mean there's no emergency?

16:54.139 --> 16:56.474
You were the emergency, pal.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.268
And I solved you.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.311
Should have known you'd end up here

17:00.395 --> 17:02.313
with all the other obsolete hardware.

17:02.439 --> 17:07.360
Oh, sure. Where else can an old soldier go

17:07.444 --> 17:10.071
when an RV salesman
makes him look like an idiot?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.073
-[Max] General, wait up!
-[Pete] Uncle Bob!

17:12.198 --> 17:15.160
Kinda tough on the old guy,
weren't you, Petey?

17:15.243 --> 17:17.287
He knows I was only funnin' him.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.248
Old warhorses are experts
on foolin' around.

17:20.331 --> 17:21.916
Oh, I don't know, Petey.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.418
Never mind him, Goofster.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.628
Let's see if we can get this tank started.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.593
Talk to him.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.219
Why don't you talk to him?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.055
He's your uncle, bonehead.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.556
Oh, yeah.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.476
[stutters] Hi, Uncle Bob.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.186
Oh, boy! Brilliant!

17:41.269 --> 17:42.854
Wish I'd said that.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.899
Don't be so hard on him, Max.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.319
Nothing anyone can say
can make the truth a lie.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.531
But you are a great soldier,
aren't you, Uncle Bob?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.785
I guess I'm never gonna
get the chance to find out.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.705
When are you gonna open this banner?

18:00.789 --> 18:02.374
[Pete] All in good time.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.043
First I gotta get this mama runnin'.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.421
But the manual says you gotta
twist the doohickey--

18:08.505 --> 18:11.007
I don't need any blankety-blank manual!

18:12.509 --> 18:13.968
[engine starts]

18:14.094 --> 18:15.762
What'd I tell you?

18:15.845 --> 18:19.015
Now it says you gotta be careful
driving this thing.

18:19.140 --> 18:23.853
Oh, button up. A used-car salesman
can drive anything with wheels on it.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.982
But, Petey, a tank hasn't got wheels.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.442
[Pete] Quiet, you goof!

18:29.567 --> 18:31.486
Can't you see I'm tryin' to steer?

18:33.947 --> 18:36.074
Petey! Stop! Help!

18:36.199 --> 18:39.285
I would if I could, but I can't!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.122
Whoa!

18:42.205 --> 18:43.748
Look out, Petey!

18:44.082 --> 18:46.251
Whoa!

18:46.376 --> 18:48.503
[Goofy] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:55.635 --> 18:59.180
Gawrsh! I'm lucky this tower was here.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.599
-[cracking]
-Oopsie.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.352
What is goin' on around here?

19:04.436 --> 19:05.770
I don't know what's goin' on,

19:05.854 --> 19:07.605
but I know what's comin' down.

19:08.023 --> 19:10.025
Whoa, big feet!

19:10.108 --> 19:12.277
Fall back!

19:14.362 --> 19:15.989
Pop, are you OK?

19:16.072 --> 19:19.159
Sure. The ground broke my fall.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.077
You broke the tower, too.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.539
What is goin' on around here, Goof?

19:24.622 --> 19:25.790
[engine roar]

19:25.874 --> 19:27.250
That is.

19:32.047 --> 19:35.133
[Pete] Help!

19:35.216 --> 19:37.385
Pete's havin' a little trouble
with his tank.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.845
That machine's a killer

19:38.928 --> 19:40.472
if you don't know what you're doing.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.474
You gotta do something!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.893
You're the only one who can save him!

19:48.021 --> 19:50.273
You kids call Peg and get home!

19:50.357 --> 19:52.317
Goofy and I have a job to do.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.696
Wow, P.J.! Your uncle's
even braver than I thought.

19:57.238 --> 20:00.075
[Pete screaming]

20:00.867 --> 20:01.868
Help!

20:01.951 --> 20:03.536
[Goofy] Hang on, Petey boy.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.163
We're comin'!

20:05.288 --> 20:07.082
Faster, Goofy! Faster!

20:07.207 --> 20:08.583
Whatever you do,

20:08.667 --> 20:10.418
watch out for the potholes!

20:10.502 --> 20:12.337
Right! [gasps]

20:12.420 --> 20:14.130
Found one! Ah-hyuck!

20:14.214 --> 20:15.215
Whoa!

20:15.632 --> 20:18.176
[shouting]

20:18.510 --> 20:20.470
I hate this like the dickens.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.058
Uh-oh.

20:25.642 --> 20:26.810
You're a general.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.770
Order this thing to stop!

20:30.146 --> 20:31.022
Hmm.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.232
Steering's jammed.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.692
Brakes burned out.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.235
I know that! I know that!

20:35.318 --> 20:37.779
So we simply turn off the engine.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.783
Oh, yeah. The engine. I knew that.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.704
[all] Whoa!

20:45.829 --> 20:49.874
So what does the manual say now,
Mr. Brass hat?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.211
The manual doesn't
cover this particular situation.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.838
I shoulda known.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.424
But a trained soldier
knows exactly what to do.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.426
No. No. You'll smoosh us!

20:59.509 --> 21:01.094
Hold it, Pete.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.096
Uncle Bob knows what he's doing.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.767
[all shouting]

21:11.688 --> 21:13.398
This little dollar went to market.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.859
This little dollar stayed home.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.776
[man] Look! Up in the sky!

21:16.860 --> 21:17.944
[man 2] It's a bird!

21:18.028 --> 21:19.029
[man 3] It's a plane!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.197
[man 4] It's Porky Pete.
He's flyin' a tank!

21:21.281 --> 21:22.407
[man 5] I want an RV from that guy.

21:22.532 --> 21:25.827
Wait! Don't go! We can make a deal. Hey!

21:25.910 --> 21:27.328
[whining]

21:34.044 --> 21:35.962
Nice shot, Uncle Bob.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.256
Piece of cake for a trained soldier.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.468
"Nice shot, Uncle Bob." Nice shot?

21:41.551 --> 21:44.137
Not only did he almost kill us,

21:44.220 --> 21:45.764
he wrecked my business.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.182
Pete! Pete! Pete!

21:47.307 --> 21:48.683
[crowd chanting] Pete! Pete! Pete!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.101
Pete! Pete! Pete!

21:50.226 --> 21:51.269
Pete! Pete! Pete!

21:51.394 --> 21:52.687
Looks to me

21:52.812 --> 21:55.023
like the general's not only saved you,

21:55.148 --> 21:56.024
he's saved your business.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.734
Huh?

21:57.817 --> 22:01.654
Uh, general, what can I say?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.907
Just call me Uncle Bob.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.035
You were right, Goof!
This guy really sells.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.454
Well, you know what they say:

22:09.788 --> 22:11.915
"Old soldiers never buy,

22:11.998 --> 22:14.918
but they sure can
trade away." Ah-hyuck!

22:17.212 --> 22:18.630
♪ Gimme a beat ♪

22:45.365 --> 22:46.491
Yeah!
