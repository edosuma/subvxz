00:01.042 --> 00:03.378
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.461 --> 00:04.838
Uh, why did you come to this lot?

00:05.672 --> 00:08.800
Well, I was interested in...
buying a mobile home.

00:08.883 --> 00:09.926
Is that our decoy?

00:10.343 --> 00:12.262
Right, sir. Detective Mayo.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.596
Good set of wheels, huh?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.098
How's that little snip of a girl?

00:15.181 --> 00:16.808
-You mean Robin Tataglia?
-Yeah.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.727
It's over with us. That's finished.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.395
In addition, I'm being evicted.

00:20.478 --> 00:24.315
It would behoove you to inscribe
this vehicle in your memory.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.901
-It belongs to a police officer.
-Cop, huh?

00:29.487 --> 00:30.321
What?

00:30.822 --> 00:32.907
Daniels just asked me out
for dinner next week.

00:35.243 --> 00:38.580
-Item three, the Mendoza file.
-(indistinct chatter)

00:38.663 --> 00:40.081
(people groaning)

00:40.165 --> 00:42.876
After two years of delays, postponements

00:42.959 --> 00:45.670
and other legalistic ballroom stuff,

00:46.046 --> 00:48.590
Mr. Jaime Mendoza, the prince of perps,

00:48.673 --> 00:51.342
primary supplier of bulk dope to kids

00:51.426 --> 00:54.262
finally comes to trial
a week from Tuesday.

00:54.345 --> 00:57.098
-(cheers, applause)
-In the Mendoza file!

00:57.807 --> 01:01.644
Bad news is, the paperwork
has gotta get organized.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.147
Which, our new ADA, Ms. Davenport,

01:04.230 --> 01:07.192
gently requests be on her desk by Friday.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.737
-LaRue, Washington, I'm sorry.
-What?

01:10.820 --> 01:13.448
Sorry, but you guys are most familiar
with the file.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.452
Oh, and remember, people,
the secret of paperwork is attitude.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.622
The wrong attitude, mistakes get made.

01:20.705 --> 01:24.459
Mousetraps spring open, cases go
bounce, bounce out of the court.

01:24.959 --> 01:25.960
Word to the wise.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.839
Item, uh... item four.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.424
Last night's basketball game

01:31.508 --> 01:33.635
between Edison Technical
and Van Buren High

01:33.718 --> 01:36.638
resulted in a post-game exchange
of rocks and bottles

01:36.721 --> 01:39.015
between the students
of the opposing schools.

01:39.099 --> 01:43.269
Let's double the pass-bys around there
in case there's any lingering ill will.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.187
Item five.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.816
The Melon Felon's still out there.

01:48.900 --> 01:54.656
I refer to the second hooker decap found
in the Heights in the last 48 hours.

01:54.739 --> 01:58.618
Head only, discovered, Caucasian female,

01:58.701 --> 02:02.247
approximately 30 years of age,
dyed auburn hair.

02:02.330 --> 02:06.042
Now, citywide, to date,
we've got five heads

02:06.126 --> 02:07.836
-and three bodies.
-(people groaning)

02:07.919 --> 02:10.672
Now, it looks like
this psycho poses as a john.

02:10.755 --> 02:14.342
Looks like he picked up his latest victim
just across the line on Jefferson.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.804
Tomorrow we may be getting a composite
to show around up there.

02:17.887 --> 02:21.349
Up to now, this has been
a Heights problem, but, uh...

02:22.100 --> 02:23.810
well, they don't seem
to be making much headway.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.771
(all groaning loudly)

02:27.814 --> 02:29.440
Okay, all right!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.443
All right, item six!

02:33.111 --> 02:35.530
Item six. Now, during this cold spell...

02:35.613 --> 02:36.948
(scattered groans)

02:37.031 --> 02:41.744
...we... (sighs) we've been having a high
level of misdemeanor activity

02:41.828 --> 02:43.955
among vagrants who
are looking to get busted

02:44.038 --> 02:48.334
so they can get a few warm hours here
at garden level holding.

02:48.626 --> 02:53.006
Now, this isn't exactly policy,
but it falls within Jablonski's guideline

02:53.089 --> 02:56.301
for more humane treatment
of your less fortunate types.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.761
Okay? That leads me to the final item.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.640
Sign up for the third annual
police sensitivity weekend

03:02.724 --> 03:07.395
at Camp Hyperion, uh,
March ninth and tenth.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.856
Yeah, the seminars include,

03:10.231 --> 03:13.860
"The Criminal and the Cop:
Urban Symbiosis."

03:13.943 --> 03:16.863
-(laughter)
-"Beyond the Psychic Threshold."

03:16.946 --> 03:18.990
(scattered booing)

03:19.073 --> 03:21.367
"The Policeman as Savior."

03:21.451 --> 03:23.703
-I took that one.
-You failed.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.497
-(laughter)
-Lastly but not leastly,

03:26.581 --> 03:30.752
"Sexuality and Aggression:
the Police Conundrum."

03:31.002 --> 03:35.215
-(all groaning)
-Sarge, does a conundrum prevent VD?

03:35.298 --> 03:38.968
-(laughter)
-Probably not. Okay. Okay, that's it.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.387
Let's get out there. Let's keep warm.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.473
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.934
(overlapping chatter)

03:46.017 --> 03:47.977
What about this conundrum here?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.070
Mendoza, B, D. Witness Mendoza.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.112
-Evidence Mendoza.
-We should've shot this dude

03:58.196 --> 03:59.322
when we had the chance.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.865
I've waded through so much
paperwork on this dude

04:00.949 --> 04:02.533
I feel like he's living inside me, man.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.410
Urban symbiosis, my man.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.121
Now, Pats, is this what
we're wearing for our date with the chief

04:07.205 --> 04:08.998
or will we change before the big event?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.875
I will change, Harry. Go kill yourself.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.920
-Wait a minute, what's the matter?
-I am not looking forward to this date.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.339
Pats, what could be bad?
Daniels buys you a nice dinner,

04:16.422 --> 04:18.841
you show him a little leg
and then he drives you home.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.679
Two out of three, Harry,
I am not showing him a little leg.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.764
MAN: Come on, move it. Move it!

04:26.307 --> 04:27.350
I gotta go.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.646
I told you
why I don't think it's working out.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.650
Among other things,
it is not natural for a mother

04:35.733 --> 04:38.653
to give her 36-year-old
son a bath or even want to.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.241
Don't be silly,
of course I still love you.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.578
No, I won't be there tonight, Ma.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.664
I don't know where I'm gonna stay.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.916
We will talk about this later.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.377
We will talk later on. Bye-bye.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.671
Housing problems, Detective?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.339
I gotta find a hotel or something.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.883
Well, I'd offer you Pegasus
but she returns

05:00.967 --> 05:03.386
to the sharp who snookered me
within the hour.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.931
RENKO: Leo, let me have my paper.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.476
Anybody know where's the captain?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.228
It's a conundrum to me.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.317
I am not gonna sit still
for some 25-year-old jerk

05:17.400 --> 05:19.986
who doesn't know squat about life,
sitting there in his tweed coat

05:20.069 --> 05:21.988
telling me my son's
an underachiever just because

05:22.071 --> 05:23.656
he hasn't handed a couple
of homework assignments.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.867
As opposed to a 44-year-old jerk
who doesn't know

05:25.950 --> 05:28.161
how to act in a simple meeting
with his kid's teacher.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.746
Don't instruct me how to behave, Fay.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.581
The guy's a bozo. I know it you know it.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.083
-Frank Jr. knows it.
-He is not a bozo!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.252
And I don't think you should be saying
things like that in front of the kid.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.129
-Like what, the truth?
-Frank--!

05:38.212 --> 05:39.213
-(tires skid)
-(horn honks)

05:41.716 --> 05:43.509
-You okay?
-I think so.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.763
Son? See why I always tell you
to wear your seat belt?

05:49.932 --> 05:50.975
(horns honking)

06:00.193 --> 06:02.612
-What's the matter with you, you blind?
-Your taillights were out.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.447
Oh, right, you smashed 'em out.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.283
Frank, get his license, get his insurance

06:07.367 --> 06:09.702
and get us out of here.
We're late already.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.953
Look, I'm sorry this happened.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.413
If we could just exchange information--

06:12.497 --> 06:13.623
Look, why don't you just hold your water.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.459
-FRANK: Why don't you tie it?
-Why don't you shut up.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.419
Look, I'm in just as big a hurry as you.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.172
-I saw a piece of rope in--
-Hey, get outta there!

06:21.255 --> 06:23.549
You got a lot of guns in there,
you your paperwork on these?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.884
Oh, won't you mind your own business.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.512
-It is my business. I'm a cop.
-Frank!

06:28.096 --> 06:30.598
Spread 'em, on the hood.
Fay, in the glove box.

06:31.015 --> 06:31.891
Get the cuffs out.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.561
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.146
If you give up the right
to remain silent--

06:37.230 --> 06:39.774
Hey, Dad, nice bust!

06:42.735 --> 06:44.695
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:46.864
<i>Armed robbery in progress,</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:50.701
<i>see surplus store,</i>
<i>corner of Peebles Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:57.792
(theme music plays)

07:59.228 --> 08:01.689
(siren wailing)

08:15.995 --> 08:17.872
(indistinct chatter)

08:18.289 --> 08:19.582
MEDIC: ...possible spinal injury.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.543
LUCY: What happened? Who called it in?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.170
I called, Officer, right here.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.631
-Can you tell us what happened?
-Yes, I heard 'em yelling.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.799
And I looked out my window
and I saw 'em fightin' on the ground.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.636
-I can't feel anything.
-WOMAN: Two white boys and this one.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.304
Did you see where the other boys went?

08:33.387 --> 08:36.015
In a car.
There was another white boy in the car.

08:36.098 --> 08:39.727
And when I came downstairs yelling,
the-the three of them drove right away.

08:39.810 --> 08:43.731
Here's the license plate.
And the car was a silver color.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.650
-I'm gonna call this in.
-All right.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.026
-MEDIC: Okay, take it easy.
-Okay.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.819
MEDIC: All right, here we go.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.198
(indistinct chatter)

08:52.281 --> 08:53.574
Go easy. Go easy, go easy.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.409
(groans)

08:55.493 --> 08:57.036
LUCY: Stay back, stay back.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.872
I gotta ask you
to describe the other guys.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.417
(crying) One of 'em had light hair.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.753
And a plaid shirt.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.756
The other one was wearing Edison colors.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.509
-Okay.
-MEDIC: Okay, let's get him in.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.429
What's wrong with me?
How come I can't feel nothing?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.181
-We got a name?
-Yeah.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.686
Lester Eagleton, student at Van Buren.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.563
-We're gonna take him down to Mercy.
-All right.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.023
LESTER: Oh, God, I can't move! (cries)

09:26.107 --> 09:28.109
Oh, God, I can't move!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.028
-(doors slam)
-MEDIC: All right, we're in place.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.071
Move, let's go!

09:32.530 --> 09:34.699
(siren wailing)

09:40.121 --> 09:44.083
Lieutenant, we've got
a silver 74 Polaris, 738XPJ.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.502
It's registered to Harvey Ferguson.
The address in the Ferries.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.337
-Got a phone number?
-It's on there.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.922
Anything more on Lester Eagleton?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.340
He's still critical at Mercy.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.093
I just talked with Van Buren.
Kid's a real ace.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.012
He's the best baseball player
in the entire school.

09:56.095 --> 09:56.929
He's a pro prospect.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.514
Yeah, and they think
he's gonna be paralyzed.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.099
And the boys in the car?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.642
Yeah, we're working
on their names right now.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.519
May I talk to Mr. Ferguson, please?

10:04.186 --> 10:06.314
Hill Street precinct,
this is Lieutenant Henry Goldblume.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.149
His tail lights were out!

10:08.649 --> 10:09.609
Was that my fault?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.070
Besides that, I made an arrest.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.576
Yes. Yes, I was on the way
to my son's school.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.537
Listen, somebody just came in.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.332
Yeah, thank you. Please do.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.296
City's insurers are denying liability
on my accident.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.839
-Kidding.
-No.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.801
Frank on the arrest, uh,
first congratulations.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.181
Thank you, Madam Assistant
District Attorney.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.766
Second, uh,

10:42.350 --> 10:45.519
did you have any good reason to suspect
the guy had guns in his trunk?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.855
Before I hit him? Course not.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.399
Was Tibbet in flight from you?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.317
Of course not.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.611
Did you ever hear of<i> People v. Martin?</i>

10:53.694 --> 10:54.654
People versus who?

10:55.112 --> 10:58.366
November case, Second Superior,
just about identical circumstances,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.743
thrown out for illegal warrantless search.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.454
It's not my fault I hit the guy, Joyce.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.582
It's not my fault you don't read
your search and seizure memos.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.085
If your car hadn't hit him,
his trunk would've stayed shut.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.171
(clears throat) All right,
then let's just not tell them that.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.091
-Not tell who what?
-The lawyer. Tibbets's lawyer.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.135
Maybe defense counsel never heard
of<i> People v... </i>what's his name.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.388
And it's not your job
anymore to tell them.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.350
Excuse me, Frank.
We got something on the school fight.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.395
Ah... the guy who owns the car says
that his son drives it to school.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.439
Kid's name is Peter Ferguson, age 18.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.317
He usually takes Mitchell Carey, 17,

11:33.401 --> 11:35.444
and a juvenile, Sandy Dayas, 15.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.196
Do we know that they're
in school right now?

11:37.279 --> 11:38.864
Lucy's on the phone, wanna pick them up?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.908
-Yeah, send a unit over.
-Are you arresting?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.160
Assuming Lester Eagleton
swears a complaint.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.706
Forgive me the rest of your department,
but we don't have much to prosecute yet.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.167
Three against one and a broken neck
sounds like probable assault to me.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.087
No argument. But a couple of minutes ago,

11:53.170 --> 11:55.631
you told me our neutral witness
didn't see it start,

11:55.715 --> 11:57.091
and neither side had weapons.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.469
If I were still a PD,
I'd be licking my chops on this one.

12:03.848 --> 12:08.477
So, we bring 'em in
for questioning, no arrests.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.897
Our new district attorney
seems to prefer it that way.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.612
(voice shaking) I had free period.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.660
I was going to get something to eat.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.876
A car drives by. And...

12:33.377 --> 12:35.629
And they yell, "Hey, nigger."

12:38.799 --> 12:41.010
Something about the game last night.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.724
Mouth's real dry.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.812
HENRY: Take your time, Lester.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.649
LESTER: Guy flips me the finger.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.444
And I yell back.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.408
And they-- they come out of the car.

13:06.118 --> 13:06.952
All three did?

13:08.662 --> 13:09.497
Two of 'em.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.124
They hit me high and low.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.504
(shaky breath) I started to get up,

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
but they kept kicking me.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.928
Then I heard something snap.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.347
(sniffles) I--

13:27.348 --> 13:29.433
I think I heard my neck break.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.354
You didn't do anything to provoke 'em?

13:34.688 --> 13:37.024
I was going to get some breakfast.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.237
All I was doing.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.158
All I was doing...

13:49.245 --> 13:50.746
Didn't know them, never saw them before.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.499
No, sir.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.797
I couldn't even feel 'em
kicking me anymore.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.850
Lester, if we can find them,
you'll testify?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.018
Yes, sir.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.232
I was gonna play ball this summer.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.110
Pro ball.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.906
I had signed a contract.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.744
Rookie league.
They said they may place me.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.499
But I might be double-A.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.169
I'm very sorry.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.547
(sniffles) What's gonna happen to me?

14:44.216 --> 14:46.802
Am I gonna lie here
for the rest of my life?

14:50.681 --> 14:51.515
(sobs)

14:53.100 --> 14:55.477
I don't even want to live like this.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.902
(curtain draws)

15:06.447 --> 15:07.281
(crying)

15:14.747 --> 15:15.873
-Murray?
-Yo.

15:16.373 --> 15:19.460
Oh, uh...
Lieutenant, yes right, of course.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.671
Back to buy another rig, huh?
Want to make it his and hers?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.090
No sir, I do not,
I want to return this vehicle.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.092
-Excuse us, please.
-Which is my legal right

15:27.176 --> 15:28.469
within a 48-hour grace period.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.264
Calm down, Lieutenant.
You got a couple of qualms.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.391
A few minor mechanical problems--

15:34.475 --> 15:37.686
Minor mechanical problems?
Yes, sir. Judas H. Priest.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.188
-The generator is out.
-Oh.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.732
And the floor under the carpet
in the bathroom is rusted through.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.526
and I do believe that you
have altered the odometer here.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.612
-Sir, I--
-The toilet backs up.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.655
-And I--
-Wait a minute,

15:47.738 --> 15:48.989
Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant--

15:49.365 --> 15:53.661
If you're just concerted,
I'm disconcerted, believe me.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.246
If you're not happy,
I haven't been doing my job.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.625
But I'm gonna ask you to take a look
at this from the proper perspective.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.043
Will you do that for me please?

16:01.126 --> 16:06.256
Listen, you bought a home from us.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.258
Not just four tires
and a cigarette lighter.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.301
You bought a home.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.930
Now, if a toilet in your home overflows,

16:13.013 --> 16:15.975
what you're gonna do, sell the home?
Or fix the toilet?

16:16.058 --> 16:19.353
And as for those other minor bugs...
(chuckles)

16:19.436 --> 16:21.563
are you going to allow yourself
to become disillusioned

16:21.647 --> 16:25.234
or are you gonna take steps
to iron 'em out?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.320
Well, if anybody should
do the ironing, sir, it should be you.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.406
Don't offer me a challenge
like that, Lieutenant.

16:30.739 --> 16:34.576
Because I am so crazy, I just might say,
"So what if it's not on the guarantee?"

16:34.660 --> 16:36.578
We'll take every one of your complaints,

16:36.662 --> 16:39.331
fix it like new and have you back
in your new home by...

16:39.415 --> 16:40.290
the end of the day!

16:40.708 --> 16:43.460
You could fix the Pegasus today?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.754
Yes, sir, every item fixed by 5:00.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.970
Possession of 12 firearms
creates the presumption of intent to sell.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.390
That's a B-felony and
that's eight to 13 years.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.307
(whimpers)

16:57.683 --> 17:00.269
Mr. Tibbets, this is
the cleanest possession in the book.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.188
Sole occupant, vehicle registered to you.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.233
We'll offer you a step down:
a C and five years

17:06.316 --> 17:09.778
What if I were to mention
the name Al Di... to you people?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.238
Hold your receiver, Mr. Tibbet.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.616
Not for any C, I don't mention anything.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.785
Your choice, counselor.

17:18.829 --> 17:23.292
Al DiPiano... happens to be the individual
I purchased these weapons from.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.294
He deals 40 pieces a week.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.838
For your full cooperation
and a wire if necessary,

17:27.921 --> 17:30.007
I can offer a D with two years max.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.179
-(both whispering)
-TIBBETS: Take it. Take it.

17:38.974 --> 17:39.850
It's possible.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.062
Set it up, Ray.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.443
-Captain. Counselor.
-FRANK: Jesus.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.280
-How's it going, Mick?
-Okay.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.324
-Find a place yet?
-No.

17:55.991 --> 17:59.703
Then tonight, six o'clock,
you take time out. No excuses.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.247
And get your polish duck for dinner.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.958
What the hell is a Polish duck?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.211
Jablonski's cure for the homeless.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.088
I'm taking you under my wing.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.756
(sighs) Okay.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.716
I'll be back in an hour, sir.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.260
You didn't yell anything,

18:15.552 --> 18:17.179
say anything, as you drove by?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.014
He say we said something?

18:20.390 --> 18:22.017
That guy started it, man.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.685
We were stopped at a light, you know.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.605
The guy comes up,
it looks like he might've been high.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.274
He starts calling us out,
gives us the finger.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.651
And how did you respond?

18:31.485 --> 18:34.696
Guy calls you out, you know,
you're gonna say something back.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.491
Like maybe you're gonna
say something to him.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.328
Next thing, he comes running at the car
and he kicks the side real hard.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.956
Pete was driving
and he got real ticked off.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.416
It's like his dad's car, you know?

18:47.626 --> 18:50.337
I got out of the car to talk to him
and look at what he did to it.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.797
I say, "Hey, what's this for, man?"

18:51.880 --> 18:53.132
And the guy comes at me.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.758
I had to defend myself.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.554
Mitch and Sandy got out
to try and break it up.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.722
Both Mitch and Sandy got out of the car?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.349
Yeah.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.061
And Mitch grabs him in a headlock
and throws him off me.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.355
We see these Black kids coming
and we figure

19:08.438 --> 19:10.691
maybe it's a gang or something,
so we split.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.110
We didn't have any idea
he was hurt so bad.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.196
I'm real sorry it happened,
but he started it, you know,

19:16.280 --> 19:17.614
he brought it on himself.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.118
Do you have any idea
why Lester Eagleton would do this, Peter?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.662
Maybe he hates whites.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.248
Maybe because of the game last night.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.042
A lot of bad blood.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.924
Is that all? You gonna detain?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.050
We'll let you know.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.012
Because I got a lot
of anxious parents out here

19:40.095 --> 19:41.388
who have to know what it's gonna be.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.477
It comes out mutual combat,

19:47.561 --> 19:48.896
they each claim the other's the aggressor.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.355
They rehearsed it, Joyce.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.149
In court, it'll come down
to "Who do you trust?"

19:52.232 --> 19:53.108
Mrs. Eagleton?

19:54.401 --> 19:56.737
-Is this Ms. Davenport?
-That's me.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.364
I'm Lester Eagleton's mother.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.159
The detective said to speak to you.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.077
-Of course.
-He said you're the district attorney

20:04.161 --> 20:05.996
and something about this case
not being too good

20:06.079 --> 20:07.748
against those boys who crippled my son?

20:07.831 --> 20:08.665
Excuse me.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.836
Is that true, Ms. Davenport?

20:13.378 --> 20:17.299
Mrs. Eagleton, I am terribly sorry
about your personal tragedy.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.343
Then do something about it.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.928
The police are investigating thoroughly,

20:21.011 --> 20:23.805
but it's true we don't have
enough evidence yet to prove anything.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.391
-Don't tell me that.
-I'm sorry.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.686
Lester didn't start the fight.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.981
Lester was All City.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.609
My son had scholarships.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.778
Now, what does he have to go
around looking for trouble for?

20:40.447 --> 20:42.950
Ms. Davenport, my son was beautiful.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.870
My son was gift from God.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.288
Yes.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.459
Don't tell me there's no justice for this.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.504
Do you have copies of these,
Mrs. Eagleton?

20:55.587 --> 20:56.964
Because I would like to look at them.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.177
You hold on to 'em.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.597
You read about Lester.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.684
You read about what they took away
from my son.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.687
Maybe you can figure out a way to tell him

21:11.770 --> 21:13.438
his life is still worth living

21:13.522 --> 21:15.816
after they tell me
he may never walk again.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.330
Right, thanks.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.542
Henry, I resent you trying
to manipulate me

21:33.625 --> 21:35.294
with that kind of emotional appeal.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.878
She wanted to talk to you.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.714
I felt she had a compelling reason.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.549
You don't see the position that put me in.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.301
No matter how I sympathize,
the bottom line is

21:42.384 --> 21:44.261
we can't prove assault
beyond a reasonable doubt.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.388
The bottom line is, if we fold our tents,

21:46.471 --> 21:49.141
three kids walk away with a brutal,
racist crime in their pockets.

21:50.767 --> 21:54.313
-Look do we or don't we believe Eagleton?
-We do.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.273
Then that's what counts.
That's where we start.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.233
No, Lieutenant,
evidence is where we start.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.235
But we can't get evidence
without manpower,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.238
and I can't justify manpower
without minimal support from you.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.449
At least keep the case alive.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.286
Have you checked their records?

22:09.536 --> 22:11.038
We're still looking
into the juvenile files.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.873
Ferguson has, uh, an assault

22:12.956 --> 22:14.583
that was pleaded down to a disorderly.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.252
-What about Lester?
-One fight when he was 13.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.546
Anybody come forward?
Wasn't there a bodega owner?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.923
He didn't see anything. By the time
he got outside, it was almost over.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.925
The only real witness
we have is the woman.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.344
And the third kid, the juvenile.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.263
-Sandy Dayas, he's next.
-Keep me posted.

22:29.806 --> 22:30.807
Then we arraign?

22:37.564 --> 22:39.733
You understand the heat is prorated?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.568
Yes, you explained
that to me on the phone.

22:41.651 --> 22:45.405
I just don't want no misunderstanding
like with the previous tenant.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.409
So long as we're understood.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.205
This is the one bedroom.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.541
Uh-oh, you didn't say furnished.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.086
Previous tenant, he's evicted.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.797
He's supposed to be out.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.926
You get nice light in here
in the afternoon.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.097
Eating kitchen's right through there.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.308
Go on, you can take a look
at the rest of the place.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.980
-What's that?
-Oh, for crying out loud.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.190
What are you doing here?

23:20.273 --> 23:23.318
I told you don't come in here
when I ain't home.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.404
I'm showing the guy this apartment.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.781
Aren't you Man Mountain McCune?

23:28.281 --> 23:29.699
You heard of this bum?

23:29.783 --> 23:32.035
I used to watch him all the time.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.996
Now, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.707
'Cause I only wanna say this one time!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.126
-Oh, do--
-Do you understand me!

23:39.209 --> 23:40.335
Do we have to go through this

23:40.419 --> 23:42.045
-loudness every time!
-(pounding on wall)

23:42.129 --> 23:43.880
-MAN: Shut up over there!
-I want you to take this

23:43.964 --> 23:46.591
little pipsqueak with you, Belinsky...

23:46.675 --> 23:48.385
-Hey.
-and I want you to turn around

23:48.468 --> 23:49.469
and I want you to walk

23:49.553 --> 23:51.555
-right out that door back there!
-(pounding on wall)

23:51.638 --> 23:53.682
Don't point your finger in my face.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.601
-You're a bum.
-I'm a world-class athlete!

23:56.685 --> 23:58.603
You're a world-class bum!

23:58.687 --> 24:00.939
This guy hasn't paid me
rent for four months!

24:01.022 --> 24:02.607
He sits around here all day long

24:02.691 --> 24:04.943
feeling sorry for himself!
I've been carrying him!

24:05.026 --> 24:09.156
Go on, McClown, tell him how
you're gonna get back in the Federation.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.283
-Right here, Belinsky!
-Uh--

24:11.366 --> 24:13.326
-Right here and right now!
-Hey--

24:13.410 --> 24:15.370
-Criss-cross, ha-ha-ha!
-Hey, you-- Hey.

24:16.371 --> 24:17.831
-(roaring)
-Hey, cut it out!

24:18.290 --> 24:19.541
(roaring)

24:19.624 --> 24:22.002
-(grunts)
-(cackling)

24:22.085 --> 24:23.628
-(muffled yelling through wall)
-Whoa!

24:24.963 --> 24:26.756
(yelling)

24:29.009 --> 24:30.343
BELINSKY: No, no, no!

24:31.344 --> 24:34.764
(both yelling)

24:35.182 --> 24:36.057
Whoa!

24:39.644 --> 24:42.564
(men yelling through wall, indistinct)

24:42.939 --> 24:44.774
Police! Freeze!

24:48.111 --> 24:49.488
You're under arrest.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.579
I'm not sure it's smart,
but we're going forward

24:57.662 --> 24:59.831
-on the boys who beat up Lester Eagleton.
-FRANK: Good.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.958
Counselor, Captain.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.629
No deal on my client, Roland Tibbets.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.548
-Deal's off.
-Oh?

25:09.090 --> 25:11.218
Now that I've had an opportunity
to more thoroughly review

25:11.301 --> 25:12.594
the full factual context,

25:12.677 --> 25:15.347
it's clear to me that Mr. Tibbetts's
plight falls within the purview

25:15.430 --> 25:19.851
of<i> People v. Martin, </i>as regards
to illegal and unconstitutional search.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.021
Do you have a case cite
on that, Mr. Brown?

25:23.271 --> 25:24.105
Yo.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.025
Keep this copy.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.905
I'll review. If applicable,
we'll act accordingly.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.073
Thank you.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.870
Frank, B-plus on the cop stuff,

25:38.954 --> 25:41.665
but we've talking D-minus on the law.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.583
-(thumps desk)
-Jesus?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.461
-Yo.
-Get a job.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.965
Good lawyering for a paralegal, Martinez.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.341
Thank you.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.761
You gave him<i> People v. Martin</i>
half an hour ago. He never heard of it.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.304
(speaks in Spanish)

25:56.846 --> 25:58.265
Now that you've gone over to the enemy,

25:58.348 --> 26:00.934
somebody's got to protect
the rights of the accused.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.569
Sandy this is Lieutenant Goldblume.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.654
Sandy?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.742
I've gone over what you said
about the fight

26:17.826 --> 26:19.202
with Lester Eagleton this morning, Sandy,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.121
I just want to ask you a couple questions.

26:21.204 --> 26:24.291
Lieutenant, I just talked with a lawyer.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.460
He said my son shouldn't be answering
any questions right now.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.879
Are you aware, Mr. Dayas,
of Lester Eagleton's condition?

26:29.963 --> 26:30.797
He's crippled.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.134
Look, I don't mean
he deserves to be crippled,

26:34.217 --> 26:36.177
but if he started this,
what's it gotta do with my son?

26:37.095 --> 26:38.430
My son's telling the truth.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.558
That make sense to you, Mr. Dayas?

26:41.641 --> 26:43.310
One starting it against three?

26:43.685 --> 26:46.688
What my son says,
that's what makes sense to me.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.649
And yeah, as a matter of fact,

26:50.525 --> 26:52.652
who knows what these crazy
coloreds are gonna do?

26:52.736 --> 26:57.157
(clears throat)
Oh, uh... I just want to know, Sandy,

26:57.240 --> 27:00.368
is it true you got out of the car to try
and stop this fight?

27:00.660 --> 27:03.079
They tell you to say that Lester
looked like he was on drugs?

27:03.163 --> 27:05.123
See, Sandy I believe
that you didn't get out at all.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.958
I believe you saw the whole thing
from the backseat of that car

27:07.042 --> 27:08.043
-Lieutenant.
-which would mean

27:08.126 --> 27:09.836
that you're clean in this,
or almost clean.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.588
Lieutenant, excuse me!

27:11.671 --> 27:14.633
Sandy, don't let yourself take the blame
for more than you did.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.800
I said what happened.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.803
Look, I'm gonna have to call the lawyer
if you persist with this.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.349
It's a question of civil liability,
and all that.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.475
I stayed in the car.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.020
That's right, I stayed in the car.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.648
I didn't get out, I didn't fight at all.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.815
I thought you said you got out of the car.

27:30.899 --> 27:31.816
No, sir.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.861
Everything else is true,
except I didn't get out.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.781
I was completely away from all of it.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.034
Still believe your son's telling
the total truth, Mr. Dayas?

27:42.285 --> 27:43.787
Why don't you just get out of here.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.623
No, no more questions.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.793
Just get out and stay out
until I can talk to a lawyer.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.380
I'm telling you, Neal,
I filed the Mendoza stuff

27:53.463 --> 27:56.216
as good as it's getting filed.
He wants it refiled, I'm quittin'.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.343
Uh-uh, you're not leaving me Mendoza, J.D.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.805
Don't tell us that we didn't file Mendoza
good enough, Captain.

28:02.430 --> 28:03.932
No, you're just off it for now.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.851
Looks as if we're gonna lose
the bust on this Roland Tibbets.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.812
The pop you made this morning, Captain?
What happened?

28:09.479 --> 28:11.022
Technicality on the arrest.

28:11.356 --> 28:15.652
Uh, but he had offered us
information on an Al DiPiano.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.779
DiPiano. Guy's a fence.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.740
Yeah, we're tipped he's been selling guns
out of a bar on Montgomery.

28:20.824 --> 28:21.950
I want us to move on him

28:22.033 --> 28:23.827
before Tibbets gets back out
on the streets.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.329
Me and J.D., we got a snitch
who knows DiPiano, Captain.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.498
Well, see if your informant
will get you a letter of introduction.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.833
We could say we're making a drug deal

28:29.916 --> 28:31.126
and we're looking for cold pieces.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.460
Particulars are up to you.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.046
Harry, call division
and appropriate the buy money.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.799
Stan, let's put Mr. Tibbets on the tour
for the rest of the day,

28:37.882 --> 28:40.593
-Hey, paperwork gets lost.
-Yeah, ask Mendoza.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.221
HOWARD: So it was just
a matter of adjustment?

28:44.597 --> 28:46.349
Mm-hm. And the generator?

28:47.642 --> 28:49.811
Just a fuse? No kidding.

28:50.937 --> 28:54.065
Certainly. I'll be there by 5:00.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.653
-Weight?
-I ain't telling you that.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.157
Weight, pig-breath!

29:02.574 --> 29:06.494
Three-twenty-six, fully-clothed,
including shoes and belt!

29:06.870 --> 29:07.954
Good news, Detective.

29:08.037 --> 29:12.459
How does one bedroom, virtually rent-free,
with a shower massage sound?

29:12.542 --> 29:14.502
Sounds great, he'll take it.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.046
You want your lungs for dinner, hairball?

29:18.798 --> 29:20.383
Fix your motor home, Lieutenant?

29:20.467 --> 29:23.386
Yes, indeed. And if you--

29:23.470 --> 29:26.848
if you want her temporarily,
Mick, she's yours.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.184
Actually, that sounds very good.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.311
-Maybe I ought to do it.
-Marvelous.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.354
All I ask is a bit of sentry duty,

29:33.438 --> 29:36.149
to keep that scruffy vagabond
from ripping me off.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.901
Locker room, end of watch.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.570
I'll give you the keys,
and you can take occupancy tonight.

29:40.653 --> 29:43.865
Oh, I got a dinner with Jablonski tonight.

29:43.948 --> 29:47.327
Um, if it's okay I could be
at the RV between 8:00 and 9:00.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.453
No problem.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.663
And the light switch is over the galley.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.376
So you letting me go now?
Now you got your own place?

29:56.669 --> 29:57.587
-Sit!

29:57.670 --> 30:00.423
I gotta fight
the King of the Amazon tonight!

30:00.882 --> 30:02.592
It's the start of who knows what for me!

30:03.301 --> 30:05.970
(growling)

30:11.226 --> 30:12.393
Hair...

30:13.061 --> 30:13.895
Frank.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.189
Doctor say you needed that?

30:16.564 --> 30:19.859
Well, he said he didn't think
immobilizing it was a bad idea.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.653
What about X-rays?

30:22.111 --> 30:23.947
He took them. And some other tests.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.741
Negative, pending further analysis.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.868
Frank, listen I called Gil Robin's office.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.663
"Negligence Gil"
the tabloid attorney? Fay...

30:31.746 --> 30:35.375
Frank I was injured in a police officer's
vehicle.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.876
I have expenses.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.754
You know, Frank, Jr. could develop
delayed stress syndrome.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.756
You know,
the city's denying that that injury

30:41.840 --> 30:43.758
was incurred in any official capacity.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.134
Well, they can say whatever they want.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.095
That's not gonna stop me
from suing somebody.

30:47.178 --> 30:51.599
Well, at the risk of superseding
your esteemed ambulance-chasing counsel,

30:51.933 --> 30:53.977
-I'd say that'd be me.
-You?

30:54.435 --> 30:57.564
And my insurance company,
who're gonna raise my rates sky-high.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.108
Fay, do me a big favor
and get rid of that brace.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.986
-Are you calling me a fraud?
-No.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.613
Unless we get to court.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.782
(sighs)

31:10.368 --> 31:12.328
Boy, the city government stinks.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.999
-Joyce.
-Irwin.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.209
On this Lester Eagleton,
I reviewed the files.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.586
I don't see our case.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.338
I believe Lester's story.
I don't believe the white kids.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.925
Accepted, but we're still talking
about three against our one.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.760
If you think those
are bad odds for a fight,

31:27.844 --> 31:29.846
for a conviction here,
the percentages are even worse.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.556
I'm not in this to be a batting champion

31:31.639 --> 31:33.683
Nor to waste the court's
time either, I'm sure.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.019
Wait a minute, last week
when you were courting me,

31:36.102 --> 31:39.480
didn't you use the phrase
"Joyce's independence" about 47 times?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.399
And I'm only advising, I'm not ordering,

31:41.482 --> 31:43.026
but you're a prosecutor now.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.737
You gotta give up a little
of the underdog mentality.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.865
I do? That wasn't in the job description.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.577
Pay your rent, pig-breath.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.371
Go drown yourself. (laughs)

31:56.623 --> 31:59.375
Excuse my Turkish here, Judge,
but what the DA has got

31:59.459 --> 32:03.171
against Mitchell Carey
and Peter Ferguson is bupkus.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.590
JOYCE: People ask 50,000
on each defendant.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.259
Lester Eagleton was almost murdered
by these boys.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.553
(clears throat) Nothing. Zippo.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.766
Any help to your case, Ms. Davenport?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.351
People stand by what I've said.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.354
A promising young athlete's been crippled.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.439
If the defendants are released today,

32:21.898 --> 32:23.441
they'll never do time and we all know it.

32:24.525 --> 32:25.902
All right, party, step back.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.363
Joycie?

32:30.990 --> 32:31.824
Come on.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.663
You know what kind of ADAs
judges come to love?

32:37.080 --> 32:37.914
What?

32:38.581 --> 32:42.251
The kind that being us a little evidence
to spice up their pathos.

32:47.256 --> 32:51.678
(sighs) In the court's opinion,
this case is sufficiently weak

32:52.345 --> 32:54.681
that defendants
will almost certainly appear

32:54.764 --> 32:55.890
for their hearing, ergo...

32:56.683 --> 32:57.725
-(bangs gavel)
-no bail.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.896
I am Lester Eagleton's mother!

33:01.980 --> 33:03.272
- All right, ma'am.
- (raps gavel)

33:03.356 --> 33:05.942
- Did you say no bail, Judge?
- (rapping gavel)

33:06.025 --> 33:08.361
-Ma'am, please--
-Did you say no bail?

33:08.444 --> 33:09.320
(bangs gavel loudly)

33:17.620 --> 33:18.454
Mitchell and Peter...

33:20.999 --> 33:22.083
You behave yourselves.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.210
Long date for preliminary hearing.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.462
Ten minutes recess.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.926
Sorry, made you look bad
on your first day.

33:32.010 --> 33:32.927
How so?

33:33.553 --> 33:35.388
Put you up to taking a lame case.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.933
You put me up to doing my job
the way it should be done.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.393
I'm grateful.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.776
-(piano playing)
-WOMAN:<i> ♪ Am I blue? ♪</i>

33:48.860 --> 33:52.030
<i>♪ Am I blue? ♪</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:54.657
-Looking for Al DiPiano.
-Follow me.

33:54.741 --> 34:00.496

34:12.050 --> 34:13.092
Friends of Eddie's?

34:14.177 --> 34:17.013
John Miles. This here's Neal
Brandywine, Jimmy Baldini.

34:18.931 --> 34:19.766
Tell her to cut it.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.726
Sit down, gentlemen.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.102
(woman stops singing)

34:36.866 --> 34:40.286
-Cuban, huh?
-Mm. Just the seeds.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.873
Jamaican grown and wrapped.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.876
Think I'd support that commie bum?

34:48.419 --> 34:50.963
Did Eddie tell you why we want
to see you, Mr. DiPiano?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.008
Slips my mind.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.762
We have an appointment with some
very serious South American businessmen.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.348
It'd be beneficial
if we had the proper security tools

35:00.431 --> 35:01.599
on our transaction.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.686
I used to do some consulting work
in that area.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.189
Possibly I could refer you to a location

35:08.272 --> 35:10.483
where you could receive
the tools you're looking for.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.443
And how could we get you to do that?

35:15.321 --> 35:16.072
Pay me money.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.533
-Hmm!
-Half a dozen Browning nine millimeters

35:18.616 --> 35:19.826
with four-inch barrels.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.369
Half a dozen Uzis.

35:21.869 --> 35:24.038
When? Where? How--

35:24.122 --> 35:27.250
Harry Garibaldi! Remember me?

35:28.459 --> 35:30.795
Gina Srignoli, Paul's widow.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.046
Gina, you know this guy?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.923
Sure, he was one of the detectives

35:34.006 --> 35:36.342
who was so nice to me
after Paul died the first time.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.052
-Freeze! Don't be a--
-Hold it!

35:38.136 --> 35:40.513
-(all yelling)
-Hold it! Hold it right there!

35:40.930 --> 35:41.973
Show the permit, Mike!

35:42.056 --> 35:43.850
All right, I got a permit, I got a permit.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.768
-All right.
-Here, here, here.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.895
All right, come on, listen,
you've got nothing here.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.689
You've got no arrests,
I didn't see anything.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.440
Hey we're not arresting you, Al.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.234
This is just the way that we always leave

35:53.317 --> 35:55.111
a classy joint like yours, right fellas?

35:57.947 --> 35:58.906
Bye, Harry.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.832
Your sister says call back
and Chief Daniels called

36:07.915 --> 36:09.208
to find out if dinner is still on.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.086
He has made reservations
at the Clair de Lune.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.755
Clair de Lune? Mmm. Cuisine-de-makeout.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.591
Sicko. Total sicko.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.013
Detective Goldblume, please?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.892
-Mr. Dayas?
-Oh, hi.

36:26.767 --> 36:30.104
Uh, my son was released
from Family Court and, uh...

36:30.855 --> 36:31.856
we've had a good talk.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.525
Go on, son.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.486
I got some stuff to say.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.614
(voice shaking)
Mitch and Pete were pretty mad

36:39.697 --> 36:40.948
about the game last night.

36:42.658 --> 36:46.579
This kid we know named Jerry was hurt
in a fight afterwards, by some Black kids.

36:47.955 --> 36:51.000
So Mitch wanted to drive near Van Buren.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.502
Maybe mess somebody up.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.047
What happened
when you saw Lester Eagleton?

36:57.089 --> 37:00.218
We pulled up,
and Mitch started yelling stuff like,

37:00.301 --> 37:02.678
"Hey, nigger. Hey, coon, come here."

37:03.846 --> 37:04.805
But Eagleton wouldn't.

37:05.681 --> 37:09.227
So Mitch got out of the car. Pete, too.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.395
Did you get out of car Sandy?

37:11.479 --> 37:12.313
No, sir.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.149
What happened then?

37:16.359 --> 37:18.319
(crying) They jumped him, you know?

37:19.695 --> 37:21.697
It was high and low, like a body block.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.284
And then they got him down on the ground
they started kicking him.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.994
I heard him scream.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.538
And I looked over and he wasn't moving.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.919
So this old lady comes running out.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.172
And they get back in the car
and we drive off.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.677
They didn't know
he was hurt bad or anything.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.804
You know, they thought
it was like stomping some guy.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.807
At any time did Lester Eagleton
kick the car?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.183
No, sir.

37:52.061 --> 37:55.481
We weren't out
to cripple anybody, I swear.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.861
Is he, is he gonna be okay?

38:02.446 --> 38:03.281
No.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.165
-Gina!
-Harry.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.168
Harry? Um...

38:17.378 --> 38:20.131
I'm sorry about what happened before.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.966
I guess I must have ruined something--

38:22.049 --> 38:23.634
Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about it.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.387
It's, uh, it's good to see you again.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.973
It's good to see you, too, Harry.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.476
So, uh, what were you doing there, anyway?

38:32.727 --> 38:34.687
Oh, I'm Al's regular hostess.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.523
-And I sing on Mondays.
-No kidding.

38:37.606 --> 38:40.359
Yeah, well,
Paul... may he rest in peace...

38:40.443 --> 38:45.281
had a 12 percent quiet interest
in the lounge.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.241
And you're looking out for it.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.912
Well, everything else Paul left me's
tied up by the Justice Department.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.916
Cars, the houses,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.668
the bank accounts.

38:57.960 --> 39:03.049
'Cause they say it's all illegal proceeds
from criminal activities.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.760
-That must be pretty rough.
-Yeah.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.180
Paul left me with so many expenses

39:09.263 --> 39:13.601
I can't even pay off
the casket I had custom-built.

39:13.684 --> 39:17.730
Gina, you're still tight with a lot
of Paul's people, right?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.023
Yeah.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.109
Yeah, I was just thinking, uh--

39:22.526 --> 39:24.195
-Now, don't get mad at me.
-Okay.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.697
Maybe you could help us
with some information.

39:27.281 --> 39:30.117
You mean, be a snitch?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.829
More like... an informant.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.915
-An informant?
-Yeah.

39:35.998 --> 39:39.543
In exchange, maybe we could help you
with the feds and with Paul's estate.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.505
Do you really think you
could do that, Harry?

39:43.422 --> 39:46.175
I think let's sit down,
let's talk about it.

39:47.301 --> 39:50.096
That... would be beautiful.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.476
Call me.

39:55.851 --> 39:56.811
Count on it, Gina.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.270
Bye, Harry.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.404
That's really good,
solid police work, Harry.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.532
I'm proud of you, you pig.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.869
Son, listen to me,
if I take my weapon out,

40:13.953 --> 40:15.871
it doesn't make me feel proud or anything.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.042
Besides, I made a mistake.
I blew the bust.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.546
Well, I thank you.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.424
(chuckles) Thank you, anyway.

40:27.341 --> 40:28.175
I love you, son.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.806
Told his whole class about his dad.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.349
He's proud of you, Frank.

40:36.308 --> 40:39.603
It's tough to tell a kid,
"No, not for that."

40:40.271 --> 40:42.440
Sandy Dayas just implicated
his running mates,

40:42.523 --> 40:43.482
Ferguson and Carey.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.192
Does ADA Davenport say re-arrest?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.819
Not till she goes
for high bail in the morning.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.328
If you have any trouble
with the other boys,

40:56.412 --> 40:58.831
I want you to call myself
or Ms. Davenport immediately.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.458
You still have my emergency number, right?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.375
Yeah, I have it.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.003
You gotta understand, though,
we didn't know what was what.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.046
You mean, you didn't know.

41:06.672 --> 41:07.506
Correct.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.508
Look, if a kid gets his neck broke,

41:09.592 --> 41:11.594
I don't care if he's Black, blue or green.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.722
If it's my son,
he's gonna tell the truth about it.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.640
We appreciate what you've done.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.101
I just don't want him to grow up
thinking he can get by with lying.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.019
Thank you.

41:21.020 --> 41:21.854
Come on, son.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.530
I've been meaning to tell you.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.659
That was a first-rate bit
of police work last week.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.164
Exposing yourself to that sort of assault

41:41.040 --> 41:42.082
took a lot of character.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.085
I toast you.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.129
Thank you, Chief.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.549
From nine to five, its Chief.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.136
From five to whenever, it's Fletcher.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.180
Fletcher.

41:56.555 --> 41:57.431
Or Fletch.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.604
Gotta wonder what kind
of a loose screw a man's gotta have

42:03.687 --> 42:06.565
to do the kind of things
to a helpless woman

42:06.649 --> 42:08.234
this pervert dentist did.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.903
I mean, I'm as lusty as the next guy.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.490
I've even nibbled around the edges
of a toe or two myself.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.869
Well, I've been talking too much.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.579
I must be boring the pants off you.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.206
Not at all.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.418
You know, Patsy...

42:27.920 --> 42:29.296
if I may be candid a moment,

42:30.339 --> 42:32.299
I was married 23 years.

42:33.467 --> 42:36.053
Cora was my friend
as well as my life mate.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.765
And I'll count as one of the saddest days
of my life the day I left her.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.601
Though, the saddest truth of all is...

42:44.186 --> 42:46.605
we just ran out of gas
after all those years.

42:46.689 --> 42:49.483
It's sad to think that that
has to happen to a marriage.

42:50.025 --> 42:50.985
Sad, indeed.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.906
Well, no pain, no gain.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.534
but enough about Fletcher Daniels.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.786
Tell me about Patsy Mayo.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.540
You must have a heck
of a busy social life.

43:04.790 --> 43:05.791
Not really.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.378
Men are intimidated
by a date that carries a gun.

43:09.795 --> 43:11.964
Gun or no, you're a damn sexy woman.

43:13.090 --> 43:13.924
Thank you.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.593
Damn sexy.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.055
You make me feel young again,
in touch with myself,

43:20.723 --> 43:23.601
connected to my long dormant sensual side.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.186
You're embarrassing me.

43:27.771 --> 43:31.233
You know, in early March,
there's that, uh,

43:32.151 --> 43:34.194
police sensitivity weekend
out at the shore.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.156
Yes, there was an item
about it in roll call this morning.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.199
Were you planning on attending?

43:40.034 --> 43:41.577
No, I hadn't thought about it.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.162
Would you think about it?

43:44.913 --> 43:47.666
Damn it, I'm screwing my courage
to the sticking post here...

43:50.085 --> 43:52.004
but would you think
about doing it with me?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.217
<i>McCune is back!</i>

43:58.052 --> 44:02.598
<i>McCune has recovered 125 percent</i>
<i>from this hernia condition.</i>

44:03.015 --> 44:06.185
<i>And he's ready to demolish all fakers</i>

44:06.268 --> 44:10.022
<i>and the creeps, which have</i>
<i>been excuses for wrestlin'</i>

44:10.105 --> 44:11.398
<i>while he's been out.</i>

44:12.399 --> 44:14.985
<i>McCune issues a challenge!</i>

44:15.944 --> 44:19.740
<i>-McCune weighs down the gauntlet!</i>
-(loud thumping, creaking)

44:23.077 --> 44:24.495
(growling)

44:30.584 --> 44:32.211
-Hey!
-What!

44:32.711 --> 44:34.838
You were warned to stay away from here!

44:35.297 --> 44:36.757
Devil want it back!

44:36.840 --> 44:38.592
You squashed my stuff, man!

44:38.676 --> 44:39.760
Look at this stuff!

44:39.843 --> 44:42.554
You come in here, you squashed this box,

44:42.638 --> 44:44.473
you squashed this can of beans!

44:45.265 --> 44:47.267
Banging on the RV
ain't gonna get your beans back.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.270
Don't come no closer!
I'm allowed to be here!

44:50.354 --> 44:52.815
-Streets is free!
-Take it easy.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.818
I was living in this field.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.404
This is a parking lot.

44:58.987 --> 45:02.908
My friend is parking his trailer here,
and I'm watching it for him.

45:02.991 --> 45:04.952
That allow you to crush my stuff?

45:05.244 --> 45:07.204
Some people let me protect them.

45:07.287 --> 45:10.624
Not like bazooka-head police cop.
Ha-ha-ha!

45:11.041 --> 45:12.459
How much is protection?

45:13.335 --> 45:15.462
Uh, it depends.

45:15.546 --> 45:16.922
It goes from a quarter up.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.800
Uh, I-I watch from under the building.

45:23.345 --> 45:24.304
Just a second.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.019
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Into the corner, nobody home!</i>

45:32.187 --> 45:34.106
<i>Hulk Hogan hits that...</i>

45:36.108 --> 45:37.735
Don't do anything stupid.

45:38.068 --> 45:39.319
Street's free.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.285
Twenty-five cents.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.498
TV ANNOUNCER:<i> ...in the area</i>
<i>and the noise is deafening.</i>

45:51.582 --> 45:53.417
Here's 50 cents for the beans.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.842
TV ANNOUNCER:<i> He's going for a slam...</i>

46:02.468 --> 46:05.763
(coughs) Um... okay. (clears throat)

46:06.680 --> 46:07.598
(kettle whistling)

46:07.681 --> 46:10.768
(mimicking whistle)

46:11.393 --> 46:12.936
(chuckles) What's that?

46:13.020 --> 46:14.980
Is it me or is it Ella? (laughs)

46:15.063 --> 46:17.483
(chuckles)

46:17.816 --> 46:20.027
(clears throat) So long.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.405
you want some cocoa before you go?

46:29.036 --> 46:31.622
But uh, then I gotta make my rounds.

46:31.705 --> 46:32.790
TV ANNOUNCER:<i> Don't know what it is,</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:35.125
<i>he's come up</i>
<i>with so many things over the years...</i>

46:39.046 --> 46:42.007
<i>Planted it right in that kidney area,</i>
<i>and it took its toll.</i>

46:43.634 --> 46:47.471
Wrestlin'! (laughs)

46:49.348 --> 46:52.976
Brother, I feel like
I've been on this job ten months.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.565
Frank, tell me you're happy
I'm working with you now

46:58.649 --> 47:01.151
-instead of against you.
-I am.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.697
Then tell me I did a great
job with Eagleton.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.703
You did. You did a great job.

47:16.416 --> 47:19.419
Then why do I feel so scared
and useless and, like...

47:20.462 --> 47:22.464
maybe I decided everything wrong?

47:30.264 --> 47:31.098
Not sure.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.394
-First day jitters?
-(chuckles weakly)

47:36.854 --> 47:37.688
Maybe.

47:40.649 --> 47:42.568
Maybe I'm just afraid
I'm going to be dreaming

47:42.651 --> 47:45.028
about a baseball player in a wheelchair.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.789
(crying quietly)

47:58.542 --> 47:59.668
(sniffles)

48:03.422 --> 48:05.799
(theme music playing)
