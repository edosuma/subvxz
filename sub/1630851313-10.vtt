09:09.791 --> 09:11.198
-I'm fine.
-We heard you screaming.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.443
What happened?
Did you have a bad dream?

09:13.445 --> 09:15.202
You want to talk about it?

09:15.204 --> 09:18.205
Sometimes talking about it
makes it less scary.

09:18.207 --> 09:20.976
It was about Mom.

09:25.307 --> 09:28.233
So if you'd like to make
a donation, you can drop off

09:28.235 --> 09:29.959
new, unwrapped toys
or sports equipment

09:29.961 --> 09:32.553
to any fire station
across Los Angeles.

09:32.555 --> 09:35.298
They'll be accepting donations
through Christmas Eve.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.058
Back to you, Margaret.

09:37.060 --> 09:39.226
BUCK:
She's a hard woman to shop for.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.154
You still haven't
bought her anything?

09:41.156 --> 09:42.322
You're running out
of shopping days, bud.

09:42.324 --> 09:43.807
Well, it's not that simple.

09:43.809 --> 09:45.158
You know, I've never had to get

09:45.160 --> 09:46.810
a Christmas present
for a girlfriend before.

09:46.812 --> 09:48.494
Aw.

09:48.496 --> 09:52.816
It's baby's first Christmas
in a serious relationship.

09:52.818 --> 09:54.926
I used to have this roommate

09:54.928 --> 09:56.836
who'd always break up
with his girlfriend

09:56.838 --> 09:58.096
right after Halloween.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.765
Now I know why.
It's too much pressure.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.175
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:03.161 --> 10:05.604
What did you get Athena
for your first Christmas?

10:05.606 --> 10:06.830
An engagement ring.

10:06.832 --> 10:08.832
Oh. No. Not doing that.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.333
No, don't overthink it, Buck.

10:10.335 --> 10:12.944
Just get her something sweet,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.446
something she could use

10:14.448 --> 10:16.114
but that she wouldn't
necessarily buy for herself.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.766
Get her something
that lets her know

10:18.768 --> 10:20.360
that you know her really well.

10:20.362 --> 10:22.362
Okay, you've just added
way too many parameters

10:22.364 --> 10:26.458
to this equation.
What I was thinking...

10:27.185 --> 10:29.110
Portable generator.

10:29.112 --> 10:31.445
Uh, useful in case of emergency

10:31.447 --> 10:33.948
and not something that
she would buy for herself.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.800
Someone's gonna be single
by New Year's.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.043
It's a good idea.

10:37.045 --> 10:38.862
-It's not.
-It's a good idea.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.805
Cap...

10:40.807 --> 10:43.642
Taylor.
Thanks for the coverage.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.976
Helps boost our donations.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.961
Happy I could help.

10:46.963 --> 10:48.554
Maybe you could help
with something.

10:48.556 --> 10:51.298
-I have a question.
-What, about your story?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.725
I thought that was all covered.

10:52.727 --> 10:55.061
Uh...

10:55.063 --> 10:56.546
♪<i> Glory to...</i> ♪

11:32.008 --> 11:34.267
<i> Phyllis. Phyllis Lang.</i>

11:34.269 --> 11:37.253
Hello, Phyllis, I think
we've spoken before.

11:37.255 --> 11:39.180
-Many times.
<i> -Have we?</i>

11:39.182 --> 11:41.182
My memory's so bad these days.

11:41.184 --> 11:42.867

11:42.869 --> 11:45.762
that you've called us
over a dozen times

11:45.764 --> 11:47.764
in the last five years.

11:47.766 --> 11:49.098
Including yesterday.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.859
And you people have been
so kind to me.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.027
Answering my calls

11:53.029 --> 11:54.528
<i> no matter what time</i>
<i> of day or night.</i>

11:54.530 --> 11:58.124
Phyllis, are you experiencing
an actual emergency?

11:58.126 --> 11:59.459
Do I need to call
my firefighters?

11:59.461 --> 12:02.220
I wouldn't mind seeing
some firefighters.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.797
They're-they're
always so nice.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.057
<i> Yes, but</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:08.375
is there a fire
they need to put out?

12:08.377 --> 12:10.286
Or did you forget
to change the batteries

12:10.288 --> 12:12.564
in your smoke detector?
Again?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.232
<i> Oh, right.</i>

12:14.234 --> 12:16.175
I'm supposed
to do that, aren't I?

12:16.177 --> 12:17.961
Twice a year, ma'am.

12:17.963 --> 12:19.128
They make ones
you can hardwire.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.297
Well, that sounds complicated.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.466
Do the firefighters do that?

12:23.468 --> 12:26.894
You-you probably need
to call an electrician.

12:26.896 --> 12:29.563
What a good idea.
Do you know of any?

12:29.565 --> 12:31.157
Ma'am, there are resources
for senior citizens.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.733
If you need someone
to talk to,

12:32.735 --> 12:35.995
<i> -I suggest that you...</i>
-I am talking to someone. You.

12:35.997 --> 12:38.164
This is not what 911 is for.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.999
You're tying up
our resources and...

12:40.001 --> 12:41.408
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

12:41.410 --> 12:42.927
You're very busy.
I can call back later.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.988
No! Wait.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.598
(sighs)

12:48.693 --> 12:49.934
(exhales)

12:49.936 --> 12:52.437
-She's back.
-(typing)

12:54.924 --> 12:56.941
So what did the doctor say?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.110
That one nightmare
isn't necessarily

12:59.112 --> 13:01.237
a reason for concern.

13:02.357 --> 13:04.783
(sighs)
Could be an isolated incident.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.692
But...

13:06.694 --> 13:08.269
What?

13:08.271 --> 13:11.347
I don't think
it's an isolated anything.

13:11.349 --> 13:13.941
He's been obsessed
with the holidays this year.

13:13.943 --> 13:16.202
How everything has
to be perfect.

13:16.204 --> 13:19.756
Now he's waking up screaming,
dreaming of his mother?

13:21.951 --> 13:24.043
Shannon came back
at Christmas, right?

13:24.045 --> 13:26.095
You think
that's what triggered it?

13:27.290 --> 13:29.532
Well, the holidays
were always their thing.

13:29.534 --> 13:34.203
You know, cookies and stockings
and gingerbread houses.

13:34.205 --> 13:36.797
Maybe I'm not doing it right.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.208
(sighs)

13:39.210 --> 13:40.985
He-he misses his mom.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.197
That-That's not your fault.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.661
So much for the most
wonderful time of the year.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.223
Yeah.

13:54.225 --> 13:56.501
It's a real pressure cooker.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.490
PAM:
Well, he still cheated on you.

14:03.492 --> 14:04.917
BREE:
Oh, at least I came first.

14:04.919 --> 14:06.419
How does it feel
to be runner-up?

14:06.421 --> 14:09.422
You boys really needed
to call 911 for this?

14:10.333 --> 14:13.092
I tried several
de-escalation techniques.

14:13.094 --> 14:16.262
I talked to them. In a neutral,
non-judgmental tone.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.005
Requested they keep
their voices down

14:18.007 --> 14:21.084
or move their conversation
to a private area.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.268
Then this one took
a swing at me.

14:22.270 --> 14:24.529
I wasn't aiming for you.
You just got in the way.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.865
BREE:
(laughs) I have no idea
what Artie ever saw in you.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.774
You are so crass and volatile.

14:28.776 --> 14:30.093
Maybe he was tired of this

14:30.095 --> 14:32.261
Zen earth mother schtick
you've got going on.

14:32.263 --> 14:33.429
I've known you for five minutes,
already

14:33.431 --> 14:35.098
-I'm bored to tears.
-All right, so you two

14:35.100 --> 14:36.690
-are the wives.
-Polygamists.

14:36.692 --> 14:38.025
It's not polygamy.

14:38.027 --> 14:40.286
We didn't choose to be married
to the same man.

14:40.288 --> 14:41.195
I can't wait to never
see this woman again.

14:41.197 --> 14:42.939
-Same.
-Hey, hey, hey!

14:42.941 --> 14:44.531
Sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

14:44.533 --> 14:47.385
but you two are stuck
with each other.

14:48.204 --> 14:51.114
You got kids, right?

14:51.116 --> 14:52.965
(sighs) Two boys.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.784
One girl.

14:54.786 --> 14:55.843
Siblings.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.395
So whatever anger
or hurt feelings

14:57.397 --> 15:00.732
you're experiencing right now--
however justified--

15:00.734 --> 15:02.233
you've got to figure out a way

15:02.235 --> 15:04.718
to put those aside
for their sake.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.054
This is a real confusing time
for them right now.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.556
And they've already got
a part-time father.

15:09.558 --> 15:13.036
They don't need a long-distance
mother doing three to six.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.896
Seven years
of lying to my face.

15:15.898 --> 15:17.582
I never even suspected.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.583
I did.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.662
Not another family.

15:22.664 --> 15:23.996
But there were times

15:23.998 --> 15:26.315
when I thought that there might
be someone else.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.000
And you never confronted him?

15:28.002 --> 15:30.261
I always told myself
it didn't matter.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.097
Not as long as I was
the one he came home to.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.915
But it turns out

15:34.917 --> 15:38.177
I'm not even special
in that way.

15:38.179 --> 15:40.480
I wasn't good enough for him.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.273
No.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.684
He's the one
who isn't good enough.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.760
For either of us.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.696
We deserve better.

15:52.193 --> 15:54.010
Still want to press charges?

15:54.012 --> 15:55.995
Just get 'em out of my hospital.

15:58.774 --> 16:00.583
Happy holidays.

16:01.944 --> 16:04.462
Stop. Stop. Back up.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.114
Mr. Darcola?

16:07.116 --> 16:09.616
Are you here to arrest me?

16:09.618 --> 16:10.860
Not today.

16:10.862 --> 16:13.972
But bigamy is still a crime
in all 50 states.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.599
You might want to ask Santa
for a lawyer.

16:17.626 --> 16:20.687
Ladies? We good?

16:25.634 --> 16:27.727
So... uh...

16:27.729 --> 16:30.029
what happens now?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.240
BOTH:
We want a divorce.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.827
But it's Christmas.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.887
That's right, ladies.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.372
Fight the real enemy.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.379

20:15.381 --> 20:18.031

20:18.033 --> 20:20.276
We could go together.

20:20.278 --> 20:23.704
We could even make it a date.

Oh.

Melia...

20:38.479 --> 20:40.053
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:56.071 --> 20:58.547
Oh, my gosh. Melia!

21:06.933 --> 21:08.248
How's she doing, Hen?

21:08.250 --> 21:10.509
She seems to be
breathing steadily, Cap.

21:10.511 --> 21:13.187
Okay, Buck, power's been cut.
Go ahead and tie it off.

21:23.932 --> 21:25.341
Okay, cable is secure.

21:25.343 --> 21:26.859
This thing's not going anywhere.

21:26.861 --> 21:29.745
Looks like
just some minor lacerations.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.623
No sign of blood pooling.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.517
(grunts softly)

21:35.277 --> 21:37.962
-What happened?
-You took a tumble.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.355
Down an open elevator shaft.

21:39.357 --> 21:41.206
Do you mind explaining
how that happened?

21:41.208 --> 21:42.800
We were talking,
and she got upset

21:42.802 --> 21:45.528
-and tried to run, and then...
-Well, which brings us back

21:45.530 --> 21:47.530
to what the hell were you doing
with this elevator?

21:47.532 --> 21:50.199
-Fixing it?
-No safety cones.
No caution tape.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.101
No signage.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.128
Okay, why don't you and I
find someplace

21:55.130 --> 21:56.314
where we can have a conversation

21:56.316 --> 21:58.207
about proper
elevator maintenance

21:58.209 --> 21:59.984
-and safety protocols. Let's go.
-HEN: Pupillary responses

21:59.986 --> 22:02.135
are equal and reactive.

22:02.137 --> 22:04.547
(chuckles)
Reactive.

22:04.549 --> 22:06.565
That's me.

22:06.567 --> 22:08.159
Oh.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.703
I'm really sorry
about the present.

22:12.056 --> 22:13.405
And what happened after.

22:13.407 --> 22:15.666
-You got him
a Christmas present?
-I tried to.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.485
Tickets to the philharmonic,
and I totally freaked out.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.729
Look, I am the one
who should be apologizing.

22:20.731 --> 22:24.567
-The tickets
kind of triggered me.
-Concert tickets off the list.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.993
-You still haven't
figured that out?
-BUCK: I've been, uh,

22:26.995 --> 22:28.587
weighing up some options.

22:29.331 --> 22:31.164
HEN:
I'm looking forward

22:31.166 --> 22:33.592
to seeing Taylor's reaction
to whatever it is

22:33.594 --> 22:35.302
on Christmas.

22:35.304 --> 22:38.080
Uh, hey, hey, so, so, what?
(chuckles) She's, uh, she just

22:38.082 --> 22:40.173
-not your type or...
-Oh, no, she's amazing.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.175
I just hate the philharmonic.

22:42.177 --> 22:44.511
Uh, but-but you go
to all those concerts.

22:44.513 --> 22:46.422
MARCO:
Because my ex
played the piccolo.

22:46.424 --> 22:49.608
And then she left me
for the second trombone.

22:49.610 --> 22:50.759
Ouch.

22:50.761 --> 22:52.036
Does it hurt when I do that?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.704
Everything hurts right now.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.539
MARCO:
I would've said yes.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.267
If it had been anything else,
I would have said yes.

22:58.269 --> 23:00.436
-(Melia whimpers)
-Truth is

23:00.438 --> 23:02.104
I've had a crush on you
for months.

23:02.106 --> 23:04.698
Oh, you have?

23:04.700 --> 23:07.051
(chuckles) I just didn't know
how to tell you.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.460
-(Melia chuckles)
-Ah, sounds like you guys

23:08.462 --> 23:10.796
have more in common
than you thought.

23:10.798 --> 23:11.947
Yeah.

23:11.949 --> 23:13.949
-Ow. Ow.
-Sorry.

23:13.951 --> 23:15.542
They're gonna get you to the ER,

23:15.544 --> 23:19.045
do some scans, and hopefully,
you'll be home for Christmas.

23:19.047 --> 23:22.358
-Can I?
-Go.

23:24.812 --> 23:26.904
Uh, hey, Hen?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.480
About Christmas.

23:28.482 --> 23:31.742
I think me and Taylor are
just gonna hang out at my place.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.244
You're gonna bail

23:33.246 --> 23:36.062
on Bobby and Athena's
holiday extravaganza?

23:36.064 --> 23:39.158
I don't feel all that merry
this year.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.492
You know?
And I don't want to ruin

23:40.494 --> 23:42.161
everyone else's day
'cause I-I'm...

23:42.163 --> 23:44.496
Missing the rest of your family?

23:44.498 --> 23:45.814
Yeah.

23:45.816 --> 23:49.427
Yeah. Me too.

What is going on?

24:37.702 --> 24:40.035
Okay? Seems like you're putting

25:07.673 --> 25:10.733
What did you say?

25:10.735 --> 25:12.659
Wasn't sure what to say.

25:12.661 --> 25:14.494
I told him that I loved him,

25:14.496 --> 25:17.515
and I promised him
that I wasn't going anywhere.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.907
But?

25:18.909 --> 25:21.185
One of the first things
they teach you on the job

25:21.187 --> 25:24.838
is to never make a promise
you're not sure you can keep.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.915
You were trying to reassure
your son,

25:26.917 --> 25:28.225
who's already lost one parent,

25:28.227 --> 25:30.602
that he's not
about to lose another.

25:30.604 --> 25:33.030
Bullets don't
bounce off me, Carla.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.849
I learned that the hard way.

25:35.851 --> 25:37.701
You still thinking about that?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.370
Now and then.

25:39.372 --> 25:43.615
-Like when I get
taken hostage at gunpoint.
-You what?

25:43.617 --> 25:45.117
Happened a few weeks back.

25:45.119 --> 25:47.193
(sighs)
You know, Buck and I

25:47.195 --> 25:50.773
got caught up
in that prison escape.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.032
Neither of us got hurt,

25:52.034 --> 25:55.052
so I didn't see a point
in telling you or him.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.704
-(exhales)
-But it did remind me

25:57.706 --> 25:59.798
that what I do

25:59.800 --> 26:02.059
is not without risk.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.877
Okay, I can't lie.

26:03.879 --> 26:06.455
I wish
your biggest danger at work

26:06.457 --> 26:08.473
was you getting a paper cut.

26:08.475 --> 26:11.460
But I know
that your job is important.

26:11.462 --> 26:14.296
Not just to the people you save
but to you.

26:14.298 --> 26:16.982
But is it more important
than my kid feeling safe

26:16.984 --> 26:19.285
when he closes his eyes
at night?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.746
Eddie just canceled.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.082
-(exhales)
-He and Christopher won't be
joining us for Christmas.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.400
That's what,
our fifth cancellation?

26:27.402 --> 26:30.737
And we were already working
with a limited guest list.

26:30.739 --> 26:32.089
I know.

26:33.667 --> 26:36.242
-This is not the Christmas
I thought we'd be having.
-Yeah.

26:36.244 --> 26:37.595
Looks like it's just
the Grant-Nashes

26:37.597 --> 26:38.837
-and the Wilsons this year.
-(clicks tongue)

26:38.839 --> 26:41.098

-What?

26:42.326 --> 26:44.509
Clive surprised Toni
with a trip to Cabo,

26:44.511 --> 26:47.162
and Hen says
that now they're thinking

26:47.164 --> 26:49.998
about just going to Karen's
family instead this year.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.259
Okay. Well,
this is getting depressing.

26:53.261 --> 26:55.354
Are we forcing this?

26:55.356 --> 26:57.840
Throwing some big holiday party
to distract us

26:57.842 --> 27:00.451

27:00.453 --> 27:03.162
There's still you, me and Harry.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.791

I d-I don't know think
I'd go that far.

27:40.567 --> 27:42.885
Then I'm going to have
to hang up now.

27:42.887 --> 27:43.661

27:43.663 --> 27:45.245
Goodbye.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.057
Wow.

27:49.059 --> 27:51.059
This is a lot of decorations.

27:51.061 --> 27:53.653
Working Christmas Day with Sue
is always epic.

27:53.655 --> 27:56.656
Well, there is no such thing
as too many twinkle lights.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.066
(chuckles)

27:58.068 --> 27:59.735
Lonely Lady called again.

27:59.737 --> 28:01.086
You cannot be serious.

28:01.088 --> 28:02.346
-Mm.
-I got her yesterday.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.347
Lonely Lady?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.682
JOSH:
Our holiday frequent flyer.

28:04.684 --> 28:08.076
She calls every year
reporting some sort of emergency

28:08.078 --> 28:11.263
-that isn't really an emergency.
-SUE: Well,
and newer dispatchers

28:11.265 --> 28:12.915
wind up rolling out help

28:12.917 --> 28:14.099
because they don't
know any better.

28:14.101 --> 28:15.675
She said there was a gas leak.

28:15.677 --> 28:17.027
I sent two houses

28:17.029 --> 28:19.363
plus police and the gas company.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.648
Evacuated a five-block radius.

28:21.650 --> 28:24.109
Which would absolutely have been
the right call had there been

28:24.111 --> 28:27.429
-an actual gas leak.
-Is it some kind
of holiday prank?

28:27.431 --> 28:30.207
I think she just wants
someone to talk to.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.100
Bonus if she manages to engineer

28:32.102 --> 28:33.785
a visit
from some first responders.

28:33.787 --> 28:35.379
Or 33 of them.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.697
-Oh.
-LINDA: Look, I'm sorry she
doesn't have any family,

28:37.699 --> 28:38.957
but two firehouses.

28:38.959 --> 28:40.200
SUE:
Well, I think she does,

28:40.202 --> 28:41.719
but they just
don't talk anymore.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.462
You know, kids grow up,

28:43.464 --> 28:45.538
and sometimes
they grow away, too.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.391
JOSH:
Guess we got to call her again.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.343
Give her our annual
"stop calling 911" speech.

28:50.345 --> 28:51.620
No.

28:51.622 --> 28:54.565

we need a stronger deterrent.

-Yeah.
-Mind if I come in?

29:01.131 --> 29:04.742

29:05.152 --> 29:06.559

something to drink?

No, thank you. This is not
a social call, Phyllis.

29:10.157 --> 29:13.250

into you.

Is there really no one else
that you can call

29:21.151 --> 29:24.669

Your family?

29:24.671 --> 29:28.098

29:28.100 --> 29:30.659
Only family I have
is my daughter.

We-we don't speak much.

29:34.498 --> 29:36.756
My husband--
he-he was, uh, the-the glue

29:36.758 --> 29:38.183
that held us together.

29:38.352 --> 29:41.427
Then after he died, I-I guess
I figured I had to be the glue,

29:41.429 --> 29:44.172
but I-I didn't have
his knack for it.

29:44.174 --> 29:47.359

30:27.993 --> 30:30.886
