01:23.080 --> 01:25.540
The sacred Golden Bone

01:25.540 --> 01:28.000
of the Many Chew Toys.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.540
Now it's mine,
all mine!

01:35.040 --> 01:40.040
The volcano!
Well, I suppose
it is time to go.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.460
But what about me?

01:42.460 --> 01:44.170
Oh, yes, what about you,
indeed.

01:44.170 --> 01:47.000
Just right over here.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.040
Ahh!

01:49.880 --> 01:52.580
You are most kind.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.920
The volcano's erupting!

02:06.500 --> 02:08.580
The volcano's erupting!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.580
I am home free!

02:16.580 --> 02:18.380
And the Golden Bone
is mine!

02:18.380 --> 02:20.460
Mine, I tell you!
Mine!

02:23.250 --> 02:26.670
Pull over, Bone Daddy!
You're through.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.380
I thought I got rid
of that mangy mutt,
Thunderbolt!

02:33.380 --> 02:36.500
-My bone!

02:39.040 --> 02:40.790
Oh, I can't look.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.000
Drat. I've got to find
that bone.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.830
Ha!
Thunderbolt to the rescue,
indeed!

03:11.830 --> 03:15.040
-I'll take that bone.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.330
Announcer:
And now, Cruella de Vil.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.120
Who turned on
the sci

03:26.880 --> 03:30.330
Cable-de-Vil
interrupts this program

03:30.330 --> 03:32.540
to bring you
the first annual

03:32.540 --> 03:35.040
Cruell-A-Thon!

03:35.040 --> 03:36.830
Cadpig:
Quick, find the remote!

03:36.830 --> 03:39.250
-Got it.
-I've got it!

03:39.250 --> 03:40.960
Take that!

03:40.960 --> 03:43.790
If you're out there
channel-surfing,

03:43.790 --> 03:47.040
forget it!
I'm everywhere!

03:47.040 --> 03:49.580
Now put that remote down
and reach deep

03:49.580 --> 03:53.540
into your wallets
for Cruella's Kids.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.540
I said it's for the kids!

03:57.540 --> 04:01.210
Just look
at this pathetic child.

04:01.210 --> 04:04.330
I mean, the nautical look
went out ages ago.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.330
Oh, it's simply heartbreaking.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.330
But with
your tax-deductible dollars,

04:08.330 --> 04:10.120
we can put a stop

04:10.120 --> 04:13.540
to this senseless
fashion "floup pas."

04:14.790 --> 04:17.750
Mom!
Can Cruella do this?

04:17.750 --> 04:19.960
Well, I'm afraid
she can, Lucky.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.290
She owns the cable station.

04:22.290 --> 04:26.290
I want you to give,
give, give!

04:26.290 --> 04:27.790
But-- but-- but--

04:27.790 --> 04:29.290
No "buts," Rolly.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.880
You can have fun
without TV.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.500
There are plenty
of shoes to be chewed
and bones to be buried.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.790
There's lots to do.
Use your imaginations.

04:38.790 --> 04:42.120
Come on, Perdy.
It's a beautiful night
for a W-A-L-K.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.920
Besides, we shouldn't watch
so much TV.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.790
Don't look at me.
I don't know what to do.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.790
Maybe we should
try to collect money
for Cruella's kids.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.790
That guy did look
pretty bad.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.380
-I mean, you saw him.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.500
Okay.
It was just an idea.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.380
What about Thunderbolt ?

05:04.380 --> 05:06.710
All:
Yeah! What about Thunderbolt ?

05:06.710 --> 05:10.540
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you how it ends.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.920
All:
Yeah!

05:11.920 --> 05:14.710
Ah! Excuse me.
This isn't a rerun.

05:14.710 --> 05:17.290
How do you know
how it ends?

05:17.290 --> 05:19.290
I know how it could end.

05:19.290 --> 05:23.250
Then what are you waiting for?
Thunderbolt's in trouble!

05:24.750 --> 05:26.210
He sure is.

05:26.210 --> 05:29.420
Okay, previously
on Thunderbolt PI,

05:29.420 --> 05:32.290
our hero Thunderbolt
had just miraculously saved

05:32.290 --> 05:34.670
the Golden Bone
of the Many Chew Toys.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.210
Or something like that.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.210
Anyway, the sharks
were circling.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.920
And Bone Daddy
was closing in on him.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.620
But, lucky for Thunderbolt,

05:43.620 --> 05:46.120
Baypup was on the beach.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.620
And he was ready
for action.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.750
Uh, pardon me, ma'am.
Official business.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.380
Ah!

05:59.330 --> 06:02.420
Hey, I still have
half an hour on that!

06:03.880 --> 06:07.120
Rolly:
Aw, give me a break!
You can't surf out to sea.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.920
Lucky:
Yeah, well, this wasn't
just any surfboard.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.710
This was a hydroponic
Super Surfboard 9000!

06:16.170 --> 06:19.790
Oh! Never did this for me!
Ahh!

06:19.790 --> 06:21.790
Hang on, Thunderbolt!

06:21.790 --> 06:23.960
Baypup's on his way!

06:23.960 --> 06:25.500
Ahhh! Ah!

06:25.500 --> 06:27.920
You're too late, Baypup.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.380
Thunderbolt is shark bait!

06:48.710 --> 06:52.080
I've won!
Mmmmwah!

06:53.750 --> 06:55.580
With this bone,

06:55.580 --> 06:59.920
I'll rule the world!

07:01.620 --> 07:04.080
Now all I have to do
is rid myself

07:04.080 --> 07:07.210
of Thunderbolt for good!

07:07.210 --> 07:09.880
Come on, Baypup.
We can't let Cruella get away.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.580
Why, with that bone,
she could rule the world.

07:15.670 --> 07:17.960
Bark your prayers,
Thunderbolt!

07:17.960 --> 07:21.420
You're headed
for doggy heaven!

07:21.420 --> 07:23.670
Ahh!

07:23.670 --> 07:25.670
Yaaah!

07:26.920 --> 07:28.620
Mommy.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.620
Ahh!

07:34.620 --> 07:37.080
Oooh!

07:37.080 --> 07:38.670
Yahhh!

07:38.670 --> 07:40.290
Whaaa!

07:41.580 --> 07:43.290
Out of my way, bird brain!

07:47.620 --> 07:50.620
That was spectacular,
Thunderbolt!

07:50.620 --> 07:53.330
I couldn't have done it
without you, Baypup.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.960
Whaaa!

07:59.960 --> 08:02.330
Ew! Ah!

08:07.290 --> 08:08.460
Both:
Hmm?

08:10.790 --> 08:14.290
Oh, yeah?
Well, I don't like the taste
of fish, either.

08:14.290 --> 08:17.290
Lucky:
So Baypup and Thunderbolt

08:17.290 --> 08:20.460
rescued the Golden Bone
of the Many Chew Toys

08:20.460 --> 08:22.960
and the police
rescued Cruella.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.790
That night,
a big luau was held
in Baypup's honor

08:26.790 --> 08:29.210
and he was
even awarded a medal.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.960
Great, huh?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
What

08:33.960 --> 08:36.210
What happened to me?

08:36.210 --> 08:37.710
Cadpig:
A commercial.

08:37.710 --> 08:40.210
Commercial

08:42.580 --> 08:46.210
Oh, finally,
something worth watching.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.880
All right, "wide guy,"
you try.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.460
Eh, your story
wasn't bad, Lucky.

08:51.460 --> 08:55.290
It just needs something,
or someone,

08:55.290 --> 08:57.540
with style!

08:59.540 --> 09:02.170
Rolly:
You know, somebody who could
handle the situation

09:02.170 --> 09:05.460
without working up a sweat.

09:10.710 --> 09:14.420
Time for
your afternoon massage, sir?

09:18.330 --> 09:20.920
Spot:
Wait a minute!
What happened to Thunderbolt?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.670
Oh, that's right.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.880
You rang?

09:28.880 --> 09:31.580
Those people
are blocking my view.

09:31.580 --> 09:32.920
Give 'em a hand,
won't you?

09:32.920 --> 09:36.580
But, sir, I am a chicken,
not a duck.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.420
A bird's a bird.
Hit the water.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.920
Yes, sir.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.170
Here goes nothing.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.420
Hold on, Thunderbolt!
I'm coming!

09:50.540 --> 09:52.380
Uh-oh.

09:56.460 --> 09:59.620
Huh? Ah! Whaa!

10:04.460 --> 10:07.380
And how about
that rescue?

10:07.380 --> 10:10.210
Still working on it, sir.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.120
Gahh!

10:15.830 --> 10:18.080
Ooh! I've got it!

10:19.380 --> 10:23.330
Spot:
Help, sir!

10:28.290 --> 10:31.500
Ahh! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

10:38.460 --> 10:40.080
Thanks, Rolly.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.960
No sweat.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.420
And so,

10:50.420 --> 10:54.000
after single-handedly
rescuing Thunderbolt,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.460
saving the world,

10:55.460 --> 10:58.880
and, I might add,
winning the limbo contest,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.880
I sailed off into the sunset.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.000
Spot:
Okay, hold it
right there!

11:05.000 --> 11:07.420
Is it my imagination,

11:07.420 --> 11:10.040
or am I getting the feathers
plucked out of me?

11:10.040 --> 11:13.290
And where did you come up
with that

11:13.290 --> 11:17.210
-I--
-Aw, you're such
a good sport, Spot.

11:17.210 --> 11:21.290
Oh, thanks.
I feel a whole lot better now.

11:21.290 --> 11:24.380
So, you know, let me
just get this straight--

11:24.380 --> 11:27.290
other than winning
the limbo contest,

11:27.290 --> 11:30.120
what did you really get
out of this, Rolly?

11:30.120 --> 11:32.880
Well, there was that buffet.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.210
Hey, let's see
if Thunderbolt is back on.

11:36.210 --> 11:38.420
-Yipes!

11:38.420 --> 11:41.920
-I don't hear those phones
ringing.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.250
Ring, ring, ring!
Not hearing.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.920
Hmm.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.500
Perhaps it's premiums
you want.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.710
Well, that's no problem.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.420
Because with every donation
to Cruella's Kids,

11:56.420 --> 11:59.330
I'll give you a copy
of my cookbook,

11:59.330 --> 12:01.670
Cooking with Suede.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.460
Plus my musical
compilation CD,

12:04.460 --> 12:06.670
Wear Plaid, Daddy-O.

12:06.670 --> 12:10.460
And in addition to these fine
and much-sought-after items,

12:10.460 --> 12:12.620
I'll also give you
a choice of my exquisite

12:12.620 --> 12:15.420
fashionable
home air fresheners,

12:15.420 --> 12:17.330
Polyester Breeze,

12:17.330 --> 12:20.170
Corduroy Summer
or Leather Meadow.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.670
And for those who really
dig deep,

12:22.670 --> 12:24.920
deep, deep
in their dungarees,

12:24.920 --> 12:27.880
I'll personally provide
a free fashion makeover.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.540
Here, let me demonstrate.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.080
Uh, yeah,
I want a super pizza
mega combo supreme.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.080
Now does that come
with a super mega drink,

12:36.080 --> 12:38.420
or is that extra?

12:41.670 --> 12:43.170
Ooh!

12:49.210 --> 12:50.880
Gah! Ow!

13:01.380 --> 13:05.380
Gah! This is
totally embarrassing.

13:06.750 --> 13:11.330
I think this story
actually went more like this--

13:28.830 --> 13:30.330
Huh?

13:31.920 --> 13:34.750
What?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.380
Ah!

13:43.250 --> 13:45.210
Uh-oh.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.620
Cadpig's voice:
Welcome to Various Five,

13:47.620 --> 13:51.500
field craft
for Solar Sector Nine
regional council.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.120
I am Gipdac.

13:54.120 --> 13:58.210
That's Cadpig
spelled backwards!

13:58.210 --> 14:01.000
Your material concerns
are why you are here,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.790
oh fashionable crabby one.
As regional--

14:03.790 --> 14:06.250
Oh, lovely, darling, lovely.
Now get to the point.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.460
I'm having lunch in 20.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.960
Uh, hello?
Remember me?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.210
I'm having a little
stomach problem here--

14:12.210 --> 14:13.790
like no stomach!

14:13.790 --> 14:16.880
Ah, yes. I'll get a couple
of handymen up here

14:16.880 --> 14:18.620
to see what they can do.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.250
You rang, oh Gipdac?

14:22.250 --> 14:25.000
The lips.
Don't move your lips.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.380
We're telepathic, remember?

14:26.380 --> 14:27.620
Oh, sorry.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.750
We have a transporter
malfunction.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.120
See what you can do
about fixing the chicken.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.120
Both:
Right away, ma'am.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.250
Not that button,
you ninny.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.710
This one.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.620
Ah!

14:47.620 --> 14:49.580
As I was saying,

14:49.580 --> 14:54.210
you two have been
brought here to learn
a system of inner values.

14:54.210 --> 14:59.120
Peace, interplanetary harmony,
and stellar convergence.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.500
Oh, very '60s.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.210
Memo to myself--
bring back go-go boots.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.460
Come, follow and learn.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.500
Hey, where are you going?

15:13.500 --> 15:16.040
I wonder
what this button does.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.380
Gah!

15:17.380 --> 15:19.420
Bow...

15:19.420 --> 15:22.000
wow...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.710
All:
Bow...

15:23.710 --> 15:25.620
wow...

15:25.620 --> 15:28.880
bow, wow...

15:32.540 --> 15:34.290
Ho, carefully, Horace.

15:34.290 --> 15:37.080
These are very
delicate machines.

15:42.170 --> 15:44.080
Gah!

15:44.080 --> 15:45.580
Ah!

15:45.580 --> 15:47.000
Uh...

15:48.540 --> 15:51.380
I feel so...

15:51.380 --> 15:53.000
centered.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
How will I ever thank you?

15:57.420 --> 15:59.420
No thanks are necessary.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.210
Just remember
what you have learned.

16:02.210 --> 16:06.210
Materialism and greed
have no place in the world.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.170
And it's really hard
to get out of this position,
isn't it?

16:12.920 --> 16:14.210
Farewell.

16:14.210 --> 16:17.790
Dematerialize in peace.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.710
Hey, what about me?

16:19.710 --> 16:22.290
You have to catch
the next fantasy, chicken.

16:25.210 --> 16:28.250
Hey, where are you going?
You're not done.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.000
It's lunchtime, chicken.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.380
Union rules.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.460
Cadpig:
And so, Thunderbolt
returned to earth,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.210
retiring from crime-fighting,

16:36.210 --> 16:38.710
to become
a full-time yoga instructor.

16:38.710 --> 16:42.170
That's it!
I've had it.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.170
I don't need
to take this abuse!

16:44.170 --> 16:46.960
You want some sucker
for your stupid stories?

16:46.960 --> 16:51.120
Then find some other chicken
to fry.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.420
What?
What did I say?

16:55.330 --> 16:57.080
Okay, you pups!

16:57.080 --> 16:59.500
I've had to listen
as I was dunked and drowned,

16:59.500 --> 17:01.330
b-buried and bruised,

17:01.330 --> 17:04.040
capsized
and even "alienized"!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.000
Now I think it's time

17:06.000 --> 17:09.040
for a little
chicken revenge!

17:09.040 --> 17:11.580
Wonder if Thunderbolt
is back on yet.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.210
Gah!

17:16.830 --> 17:20.000
Welcome back,
my generous TV Land friends,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.880
to the Cruell-A-Thon,

17:21.880 --> 17:24.210
benefiting
Cruella's kids.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.830
Yes, your hard-earned pennies
will help me

17:26.830 --> 17:28.580
prevent future generations

17:28.580 --> 17:32.120
from a veritable plague
of fashion faux pas.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.040
Now let's take a look
at the tote-board total,
shall we?

17:39.710 --> 17:42.040
Five cents?

17:42.040 --> 17:44.580
That's it?
Five measly cents?

17:44.580 --> 17:47.170
Hey, I had to pay
for the sucker.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.210
The only suckers
I want

17:49.210 --> 17:51.960
are the ones that call in
and donate money!

17:53.580 --> 17:57.000
Oh, hello! Well,
speaking of calling in,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.250
-let's check the phones.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.620
Who? No, no Thelma here.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.460
Hello?
Hold on, I'll ask.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.880
Um, Miss de Vil, do you want
your carpets cleaned?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.330
Listen to me out there!

18:09.330 --> 18:11.500
I don't want fashion sense.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.620
I want dollars!
Do you hear me?

18:13.620 --> 18:15.250
Dollars, dollars, dollars!

18:15.250 --> 18:19.380
Now get to those phones
and start calling!

18:21.710 --> 18:23.040
This stinks, man.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.380
Thunderbolt is still
not back on.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.790
Hey, excuse me, everyone.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.500
But I believe we are about
to hear my version

18:30.500 --> 18:32.790
of how Thunderbolt PI ends.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.620
Ahem.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.830
Spot:
Thunderbolt was between
Cruella and the sharks.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.920
There was no way out.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.920
When suddenly...

18:50.080 --> 18:54.210
Gah!

18:54.210 --> 18:59.000
Oh, oh!
It's Cluckzilla!

19:00.880 --> 19:03.290
Run for your lives!

19:03.290 --> 19:05.710
Ahhh!

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh! Ah!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.380
Gah!

19:12.380 --> 19:14.380
Ahhh!

19:18.880 --> 19:20.380
Ahhh!

19:20.380 --> 19:23.000
Cluckzilla!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.290
Waaah!

19:39.420 --> 19:42.120
That is really annoying!

19:42.120 --> 19:44.000
Uh-oh.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.710
Oh, Cluckzilla!

20:23.210 --> 20:25.670
Ahh!

20:25.670 --> 20:27.080
That's it!

20:27.080 --> 20:30.080
Thought you'd beat
the chicken!

20:32.420 --> 20:34.790
Ha! Roar!

20:34.790 --> 20:37.790
Ha ha!
Cluckzilla headed
straight for the city!

20:37.790 --> 20:39.620
Ahh!

20:39.620 --> 20:42.540
Was that the coolest
or what?

20:42.540 --> 20:44.420
You're right--
"or what."

20:44.420 --> 20:45.710
Ah, I feel better.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.830
So what do you want
to do now?

20:47.830 --> 20:51.330
Whatever you want, Spot.

20:51.330 --> 20:54.710
I think I'd rather
watch the Cruell-A-Thon.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.830
Not one call.

20:56.830 --> 20:59.880
Not one single call.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.710
Doesn't anyone care
about the fashion

21:06.830 --> 21:08.750
Hello?
Cruell-A-Thon.

21:08.750 --> 21:12.920
How much would you like
to give to Cruella's Kids?

21:12.920 --> 21:15.920
No, I don't want to change
my long-distance carrier!

21:15.920 --> 21:18.250
That's it!
We're off the air.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.080
Announcer:
We now return
to Thunderbolt PI!

21:24.080 --> 21:26.710
Hey, it's Thunderbolt.

21:26.710 --> 21:30.040
He's back on!
He's back on, you guys.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.750
That's not what happens.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.880
Not even close.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.880
My ending was much better.

21:47.880 --> 21:52.080
I could think of 101 endings
better than that one.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.000
You are so right.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.170
Our endings were
much more interesting

21:56.170 --> 21:58.380
than anything
we could see on TV.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.290
Announcer: Tonight,
on the Inner Peace Channel,

22:09.290 --> 22:11.500
Days of our Past Lives.

22:11.500 --> 22:15.080
We'll meet a man
who claims to have been
a ladybug.
