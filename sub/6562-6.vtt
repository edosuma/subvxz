10:52.933 --> 10:54.500
[all groaning]

10:54.567 --> 10:57.067
THANKS TO ROBIN AND HOODIE.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.267

12:12.400 --> 12:14.100
AND THAT'S ME.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.233

12:15.300 --> 12:16.467

12:16.533 --> 12:17.467

12:19.267 --> 12:20.700
[siren blares]

12:20.767 --> 12:22.333

12:22.400 --> 12:23.733

12:23.800 --> 12:25.333
BECAUSE KENDALL IS GOING
TO DISAPPEAR

12:25.400 --> 12:26.700
FROM THE PUBLIC EYE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

12:26.767 --> 12:27.767
- OH, REALLY?

12:27.833 --> 12:28.800
WHERE AM I GOING?

12:28.867 --> 12:31.167
- YOU ARE GOING TO BE LIVING

12:31.233 --> 12:33.267
IN HERE FOR FIVE WEEKS.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.100
THAT'S THE STANDARD LIFE CYCLE
FOR CELEBRITY GOSSIP.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.933
- OH, NO!

12:38.067 --> 12:40.633
- HE'S NOT LIVING IN THERE,

12:40.700 --> 12:44.233
'CAUSE KENDALL IS GONNA WALK
THE RED CARPET WITH JO.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.067
- NOW GIVE US THE BOY.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.800

12:50.100 --> 12:52.667
[train horn blaring]

12:52.733 --> 12:53.967
- HERE YOU GO.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.433
- LOCKED IN A CLOSET OR NOT,

12:57.500 --> 12:59.667
JO IS WALKING THE RED CARPET
WITH JETT.

12:59.733 --> 13:02.833
- WAIT, DOESN'T ANYONE CARE
WHAT WE THINK?

13:02.900 --> 13:04.233
all: NO!

13:04.300 --> 13:05.367
- NO, NO, NO!

13:05.433 --> 13:08.400
NO, NO!

13:08.467 --> 13:10.200
- THIS WAS YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG,

13:10.267 --> 13:12.367
TO SCUFF THE SHOES
SO I COULDN'T SELL THEM

13:12.433 --> 13:13.667
AND YOU COULD WEAR THEM.

13:13.733 --> 13:15.067
- OH, YOU KNOW I'M NOT
THAT CLEVER.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.867
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.467
BUT THE SHEIKH'S COMING
IN THREE HOURS,

13:18.533 --> 13:19.933
AND WHEN HE SEES THE SCRATCH,

13:20.067 --> 13:21.800
BYE-BYE 3 GRAND.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.700
- AH, THEN WE'LL JUST
WASH IT OFF.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.800
- NO, NO!

13:25.867 --> 13:28.867
YOU DON'T PUT WATER ON LEATHER.
IT RUINS IT.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.700
- WELL, I GUESS
WE CAN'T SELL THEM.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.133
SO I'LL JUST KEEP THEM
AND WEAR THEM.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.267
BYE!

13:35.333 --> 13:37.800
- AH!
STOP!

13:37.867 --> 13:40.200
LOOK, WE'LL MATCH THE FINISH

13:40.267 --> 13:42.533
AND BUFF OUT THE SCRATCH

13:44.933 --> 13:47.533
CAN WE BORROW YOUR MAKEUP
AND NAIL POLISH?

13:47.600 --> 13:48.500
HUH?

13:48.567 --> 13:50.400
- OKAY.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.867

[alarm blaring]

13:52.967 --> 13:53.933
[dog barks]

13:54.067 --> 13:55.667
- YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND.

13:55.733 --> 13:57.067
- CORRECTION.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.867
YOU'VE LOST.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.800
AND HOW DOES DEFEAT TASTE?

14:00.867 --> 14:03.667
NOT AS SWEET AS VICTORY
OR FRUIT SMACKERS.

14:03.733 --> 14:04.800
- OH-HO!
OH!

14:04.867 --> 14:06.767
NO, SNACK--
SMACKERS!

14:06.833 --> 14:07.800
LET GO!

14:07.867 --> 14:08.967

14:09.067 --> 14:11.067
YOU WANT YOUR SMACKERS,
THEN YOU'LL PAY.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.433
IF YOU WANT ME, DON'T,

14:12.500 --> 14:16.067
BECAUSE I'LL BE PAYING FOR MORE
VOICEOVER LESSONS.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.167
EXCUSE ME.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.400

14:20.467 --> 14:21.600
[keys jangling]

14:24.600 --> 14:26.100
[bright music]

SWEET!

14:40.400 --> 14:43.267
[all cheering]

14:48.067 --> 14:50.767
- I AM VERY MAD AT ALL OF YOU.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.300
- KENDALL, THERE ARE TWO THINGS
THE PUBLIC CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF:

14:53.367 --> 14:54.900
HOT CELEBRITY COUPLES

14:54.967 --> 14:58.233
AND CUTE ANIMALS
DOING SILLY THINGS.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.667

A SNEEZING PANDA,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.300
WE NEED TO GET YOU ON THAT
RED CARPET TOMORROW WITH JO.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.567

A PUBLICITY JUGGERNAUT

15:10.633 --> 15:12.367
FOR BIG TIME RUSH.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.333
- BUT IF I GO
ON THE RED CARPET WITH JO,

15:14.400 --> 15:16.100
SHE'LL ALIENATE HER FANS

15:16.167 --> 15:18.300
AND GET KICKED OFF THE SHOW.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.067
- I HAVE A THREE POINT PLAN
FOR THAT.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.433
I DON'T CARE!

15:22.500 --> 15:24.567
- WELL, IS THERE A PLAN

15:24.633 --> 15:26.233
WHERE EVERYBODY
GETS WHAT THEY WANT

15:26.300 --> 15:28.067
AND JO AND I COULD JUST GO
TO THE ZOO?

15:28.067 --> 15:31.067
all: NO.

15:31.133 --> 15:34.400
[squeaking noises]

15:34.467 --> 15:35.433
- HA! IT'S PERFECT!

15:35.500 --> 15:36.733

BUSTER CLYDES?

15:50.800 --> 15:53.400
- NO.

15:53.467 --> 15:55.367
- TRY ONE ON, JUST ONE.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.100
NOW, HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

16:03.167 --> 16:05.367
- OH, IT FEELS GOOD.

[screaming]

16:38.133 --> 16:41.067
[camera shutters clicking]

16:42.633 --> 16:45.400
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I FOUND
A WAY OUT OF THIS?

16:45.467 --> 16:47.767
- I WOULD SAY, I'M TIRED
OF SNEAKING AROUND,

16:47.833 --> 16:48.800
AND I'M IN.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.233
- IT'S A THREE POINT PLAN.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.600
IT INVOLVES YOUR PEOPLE,
MY PEOPLE,

16:54.667 --> 16:55.633

16:57.433 --> 17:00.767
OKAY, I'M GONNA DUMP JO
ON OUR DATE AT THE ZOO.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.733

SWOOPS IN AND COMFORTS ME
AND MY BROKEN HEART.

17:05.533 --> 17:07.667
- AND YOU REALIZE THAT I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN THE GUY FOR YOU,

17:07.733 --> 17:10.067
BECAUSE I'M WAY BETTER LOOKING
THAN KENDALL.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.333
- A BIG PUBLIC BREAK-UP
IN FRONT OF ALL THE PAPARAZZI.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.633
IT'S GENIUS.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.900
- AND BY DUMPING
ONE OF THE HOTTEST

17:15.967 --> 17:17.500
NEW FACES IN HOLLYWOOD,

17:41.200 --> 17:42.300
- I CAN FIX IT.

17:42.367 --> 17:43.267
- THE SHEIKH IS GONNA
BE HERE

17:43.333 --> 17:44.400
IN 20 MINUTES.

17:44.467 --> 17:47.367
- I CAN FIX IT!

17:47.433 --> 17:51.233
- THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
IS GETTING IN THAT DOOR NOW.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.900
- [cackling]

17:52.967 --> 17:54.433
YOU HEAR THAT?

17:54.500 --> 17:58.667
NO MORE FREE SNACKS
FROM ROBIN AND HOODIE.

17:58.733 --> 18:00.533
[all groaning]

18:00.600 --> 18:03.467
[metallic clanging]

18:06.567 --> 18:08.300
- OH.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.333
[alarm blaring]

18:10.400 --> 18:12.267
[dog barking]

18:12.333 --> 18:13.567
- CARLOS!

18:13.633 --> 18:16.167
- IT'S A TRAP!

18:16.233 --> 18:20.400
[crashing]

18:20.467 --> 18:23.367
- SO AFTER FALLING INTO BITTERS'
STORAGE ROOM TRAP

18:23.433 --> 18:25.233
AND THOROUGHLY DEFEATED,

18:25.300 --> 18:29.067
ROBIN AND HOODIE GAVE UP
THEIR REBELLIOUS WAYS.

18:29.133 --> 18:30.533
- ARE YOU DONE?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.333
- AREN'T MY VOICEOVER LESSONS
REALLY PAYING OFF?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.833
- YOU'LL NEVER WIN,

18:33.900 --> 18:36.833
BECAUSE WHENEVER INJUSTICE REARS
ITS UGLY HEAD,

18:36.900 --> 18:38.900
THE MASSES WILL RISE.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.400
- [laughs]

18:40.467 --> 18:43.467
I'M SO SCARED
OF THE MASSES RISING.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.433
[laughs]

18:52.133 --> 18:55.100
[triumphant music]

18:55.167 --> 18:56.567
* *

18:56.633 --> 18:59.500
[dog barking]

19:03.300 --> 19:07.333
AND REALIZING HE WAS
OUTNUMBERED AND SCARED,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.367
BITTERS LOWERED THE PRICE
OF FRUIT SMACKERS

19:09.433 --> 19:11.067
TO $1.25?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.733
AND RAN TO HIS OFFICE.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.400
[all cheering]

19:20.667 --> 19:22.300

19:28.200 --> 19:29.900
[farting noise]

19:29.967 --> 19:30.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:30.967 --> 19:32.467
FORGET ABOUT THE $3,000.

19:32.533 --> 19:33.900
