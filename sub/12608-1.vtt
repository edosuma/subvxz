13:35.084 --> 13:36.917
I have just two questions.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.667
The first is,
does the PFC still
stand by its policy

13:39.667 --> 13:42.667
of drug tolerance
with absolutely
zero drug testing

13:42.667 --> 13:44.542
required by your league?

13:44.542 --> 13:48.917
I'm glad you asked me that
because I feel
like it's high time

13:48.917 --> 13:52.291
for all of organized sports
to recognize the inevitable,

13:52.291 --> 13:56.875

to unfettered competition.

13:58.583 --> 14:02.000

by the laws of common sense,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.417
then there's no cheats.

the fans want

14:06.959 --> 14:09.583
and this is what
my organization plans
to give them, thank you.

14:09.583 --> 14:13.084

and present danger
to your fighters?

you know what,

14:14.917 --> 14:18.375
I invite you to take
a good look at these
two fine specimens

either of them look like

14:20.041 --> 14:22.250
they're in any sort of
medical duress to you.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.667

14:23.667 --> 14:24.792
is for you, Mr. Caesar.

27:27.209 --> 27:29.000

27:29.000 --> 27:30.458
It doesn't look good.

27:30.458 --> 27:33.084
Vega's not going to
be happy about this.

to get this run in?

the really

who beat my guy.

called Old School,
gave Cobra a concussion

three of his ribs?

36:59.084 --> 37:02.041
Why do you wrap your hands
in boxing and in MMA?

37:03.333 --> 37:04.708
So you don't
sprain your wrist?

37:04.708 --> 37:05.875
Or break your hands.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.000
Exactly.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
That's because
you don't know
how to punch.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
You don't know how to punch
without hurting yourself.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.333
Not your opponent,
hurting your damn self.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.125
News flash, guys.

37:16.125 --> 37:21.042
In martial arts,
your hands, your feet,
your elbows, your knees

37:21.042 --> 37:24.250
even your head
were used as weapons
and were trained as such.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.125
You understand?

37:26.125 --> 37:28.166
See, striking is not
just about

37:28.166 --> 37:30.417
putting on gloves
and hitting a heavy bag

37:30.417 --> 37:32.917
and letting a heavy bag
stop your fist.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.041
Striking is about
perfecting the technique.

37:36.041 --> 37:38.792
Maximum result,
minimal effort. Okay?

37:38.792 --> 37:41.250
Just like the precision
of a golf swing.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.834
You transfer all the power
into one specific point.

37:46.792 --> 37:47.875
See?

37:49.084 --> 37:50.000
Stop that shit.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.167
Okay, now look.

37:53.167 --> 37:55.959
If I were an inch
closer or further away,
they wouldn't have broken.

37:55.959 --> 37:58.209
See, you have to
find your sweet spot.

37:58.209 --> 37:59.583
So distance.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:00.959 --> 38:03.000
Distance along
with proper technique

38:03.000 --> 38:05.166
is where you're
the most powerful.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.375
Now you try.

38:08.291 --> 38:11.083
I want you to punch
through the board.

38:11.083 --> 38:13.250
Okay? Use these two knuckles.

Go.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.000
See?

Now, hitting a heavy bag
would give you nearly
a 100% success rate.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.333
Not so with this.

38:52.708 --> 38:55.875
up against the seven-foot
"Psycho" Caesar Braga.

38:55.875 --> 38:59.834
Braga is undefeated
and has decimated
his last three opponents.

38:59.834 --> 39:02.041
Tickets are now on sale
at the Bangkok Sporting...

39:02.041 --> 39:03.917
I don't want to get hit
with any of his power shots.

39:05.167 --> 39:06.583
I think I'll have Case
work with me on that.

So, how is Thailand
treating you, Mr. James?

39:30.708 --> 39:32.084
Like a king, so far.

39:32.084 --> 39:33.458
I have a few
questions for you.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.167
You bring security
this time or what?
(CHUCKLES)

39:35.167 --> 39:36.959
No need, I assure you.

39:36.959 --> 39:40.375
Okay, are you nervous
about the fight with Braga?

39:40.375 --> 39:42.042
I'm a bit nervous.

39:42.042 --> 39:43.250
Nervous that I might
end his career

39:43.250 --> 39:44.959
and his family
would have to go graze

39:44.959 --> 39:46.041
in less favorable pastures.

I don't think you have
the right information.

39:56.083 --> 39:58.792
But Jackson was
arrested yesterday
on assault charge

39:58.792 --> 40:01.917

is pretty hectic

with its benefits, huh?

41:15.917 --> 41:19.167
Well, you know,
not that I need
to qualify myself,

41:19.167 --> 41:24.000
but my job with
PFC and my boss
is purely professional.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Not that you would be
insinuating
something more,

work with your schedule?

Oh, Boonkie is
the best nanny.

is make some
fuck-tastic jokes.

45:49.125 --> 45:51.084
Brody meant no
disrespect, Mr. Vega.

45:51.084 --> 45:53.000
Okay, I didn't ask
for your input.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.917
Understand?

45:54.917 --> 45:56.375
You're supposed to be
getting this guy
in fighting shape,

excuses for him.

45:58.792 --> 46:00.000

a stockbroker and died
robbing a jewelry store.

Wow, I'm sorry
to hear it.

46:08.208 --> 46:10.167
Yeah, don't be.

46:10.167 --> 46:13.167
We met, got married
two months later.

46:13.167 --> 46:16.125
Kinda swept me off my feet
before I ever
really got to know him.

46:16.125 --> 46:17.959
Guess we live
and learn, huh?

46:17.959 --> 46:19.166
Yeah, we do.

46:21.084 --> 46:23.250
So, what else can you
tell me about yourself?

46:23.250 --> 46:26.084
Other than having some
really bad-ass
moves in the cage.

46:27.625 --> 46:29.792
Well, uh, I'm
from New Orleans.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.625

the only person I know
without a cell phone.

46:33.625 --> 46:36.417
I don't know how
interesting that is.

46:36.417 --> 46:39.042

like everybody else,

46:39.042 --> 46:41.375
just trying to make it
day by day, you know?

46:41.375 --> 46:45.792
Well, there was one
more thing I was
a bit curious about.

46:45.792 --> 46:48.875
You want to tell me
a little bit about
your time in prison?

46:48.875 --> 46:50.375
Why you went in?

46:55.291 --> 46:57.375
Who told you about that?

46:57.375 --> 47:00.084
No one told me,
I just looked into it.

47:02.708 --> 47:04.041
"Looked into it"?

47:04.041 --> 47:06.500
You mean, like,
you investigated me?

47:07.167 --> 47:08.417
No.

47:08.417 --> 47:11.875
The Internet.
Maybe you've heard of it?

of dating in the 21st century.

47:17.500 --> 47:20.458
Look, Case, I'm sorry
if I offended you.

47:20.458 --> 47:22.125
But I've been
through a lot.

47:22.125 --> 47:24.333
And I have to be
extremely careful

47:24.333 --> 47:26.166
about who I
bring into my life.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.166
Into Morgan's life.

47:32.208 --> 47:35.167
Hey, look, I think
we made a mistake.

47:35.167 --> 47:36.417
I need to go.

47:38.750 --> 47:41.875
So, what's your plan for
improving the situation?

47:41.875 --> 47:44.875
Because you got
less than four weeks
to turn things around.

47:44.875 --> 47:46.041
No worries, Hugo.

47:46.041 --> 47:47.542
Kickin' it into high gear.

47:47.542 --> 47:49.708
This fight's in the bag.

47:49.708 --> 47:50.875
What gear are you taking?

47:50.875 --> 47:52.084
BRODY: I'm not
taking anything.

47:52.084 --> 47:53.375
I thought I'd
give my body a rest.

47:53.375 --> 47:55.500
That's a problem.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.125
What do you got?
You bring anything?

47:57.125 --> 48:00.125
Well, I got some Deca
and some Winnie tabs.

48:00.125 --> 48:01.250
That's bullshit.

48:01.250 --> 48:03.291
I want you
to call my guy.

48:04.875 --> 48:07.000
All right, go see
my doc, okay?

48:07.000 --> 48:11.333
He'll get you on a course
of Test Cypionate, Winstrol.

48:11.333 --> 48:13.166
We'll throw in
some Anadrol.

48:13.166 --> 48:16.500
(SCOFFS) Should
have you in beast mode
by the time of the fight.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.000
If you don't think Braga
is doing the same thing,

48:18.000 --> 48:19.458
you're a lot dumber
than I thought.

48:22.125 --> 48:25.291
Come on, champ,
balls to the wall.

48:25.291 --> 48:29.042
Give our customers

keep a secret.

so can he.

48:51.125 --> 48:52.917
Okay, what?

48:54.667 --> 48:57.042
When I stepped out
to have a smoke,

48:57.042 --> 49:02.458
I saw your boy, Case,
with Myca and the nanny
and her kid.

49:02.458 --> 49:05.042
Just outside the restaurant.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.750

to spar with you.

49:41.042 --> 49:43.667

about something.

49:43.667 --> 49:46.291
Hey, Case, come over here.

BRODY: How much is this
insurance costing me?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.042
Believe me, Brody,
it's worth it.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:23.083
Besides, you're making
enough money to afford it.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:26.375
Yeah, man. Plus, you got kids.
What if something
happens to you?

01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:28.417
You could lose everything
off one major injury.

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:34.583
What if I don't
pass the physical?

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:37.500
Don't be ridiculous,
you're healthy as a horse.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.125
All right.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.708
What if something
I'd taken in the past
shows up in my blood work?

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.125
They disqualify me?

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:47.000
Whatever you might have
taken before you
came to Thailand

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.959
won't still be

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:50.625
Don't worry about it.

01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:58.166
Hey, I'd really
like to thank you.

01:01:58.166 --> 01:01:59.917
For what?

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.250
Well, you said some things
I really needed to hear.

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.250
And I'd like to
show my appreciation
if you'd let me.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.500
Well, I appreciate
your appreciation,
Mr. Walker.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.084
So what do you
have in mind?

01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:12.000
A Louie Thai do-over.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.083
I'd like that. Done.

That's all right, bro.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.417
You just didn't have
it today, that's all.

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:03.583
His fucking style, man,
it's just throwing me off.

01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:07.084
I can tell.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:10.625
Dude. If it's
styles that win fights,
I just gotta learn how...

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:12.542
Mmm!

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.042

01:04:05.917 --> 01:04:08.875

what comes close.

01:04:22.417 --> 01:04:25.083
MYCA:   You know,
Brody's really lucky
to have you as a friend.

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:26.708
Loyalty is rare these days.

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:30.083
CASE:   Well, I consider
my friends family.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:31.875
Where is your
family, Case?

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.333
I mean, if you don't
mind me asking.

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:35.375
I know how you are
about your privacy.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.250
Okay, stop.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.542
First, let me apologize
about the other evening.

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:43.750
I'm way out of practice
with this whole
dating thing.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.417
But I'd really like to
get to know you better,

01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:50.042
so listen, you can
ask me anything
from now on, okay?

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:52.250
Okay.
Okay.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:56.708
So, is there a Mrs. Case?
Any little Cases
running around?

01:04:56.708 --> 01:05:00.042
(CHUCKLES) No mini-Cases.
(CHUCKLES)

01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:02.250
I thought there'd be
a Mrs. Case one time.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.291
But turned out she
was already married.
Oh, wow.

01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:07.333
Yeah.
That must've hurt.

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:09.084
What was up with that?

01:05:09.084 --> 01:05:13.417
Well, there are these
women who fixate on
romancing inmates.

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.208
There's a name for
them, but I forget.

01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:19.209
But once the inmate
gets released,
then the fantasy's over.

01:05:19.209 --> 01:05:20.917
How long ago was that?

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.041
Seven years ago.

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:24.834
Well, I believe seven's
a very lucky number.

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:25.959
You do, do you?

01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.834
Yeah, I do.

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.792
Case, I think things
are really gonna start
turning around for you.

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:32.084
Think so?

01:05:32.084 --> 01:05:33.291
I think so.

01:05:34.166 --> 01:05:36.125
So here's my place.
Oh.

01:05:37.084 --> 01:05:38.125
(CHUCKLES)

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:40.500
Thank you.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.084
So, I hope I didn't
have you out too late.

01:05:44.084 --> 01:05:47.375
It must be just about
the time to tuck
little Morgan into bed, huh?

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.500
Oh, Morgan spending
the night with
Boonkie tonight,

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.458
so, I don't
have a curfew.

01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:58.250
So, I guess you have to
get up pretty early
to train, huh?

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:02.042
Yeah, yeah. I got to get up
pretty early to train Brody.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.458
And, uh, you know,
work out.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:10.458
Well, I had a really
great time tonight.

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:12.000
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.792
Thank you.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:15.209
Yeah.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:17.125
Good night.

01:06:22.959 --> 01:06:24.167
Bye.

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.041
Bye.

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:32.042
You froze again,
didn't you? (CHUCKLES)

01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:35.209
"No, Myca, I don't
have to wake up early.
I don't have to train."

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:37.042
"All I have to look
forward to is going back

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:39.417
"to my room and talking
to my-goddamn-self."

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:41.834
You are an idiot.

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:43.125
All you had to do was say,

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.458
"Well, Myca, since you
don't have a curfew,

01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:47.667
"I would like to spend
more time with you.

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:50.834
"Since we happen to be
in front of your condo..."

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:52.500
You'd think I'd get it.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.250
You'd think my
dumb ass would get it.

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:17.291
What?

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:20.625
Mr. Vega has been
hearing a lot of good
things about you lately.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:23.125
Some very,
very good things.

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:24.291
And I care, why?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.291
This.

01:07:27.166 --> 01:07:28.542
What's that?

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:29.959
It's a contract.

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:32.917
It's your contract
to fight for the PFC.

01:07:34.209 --> 01:07:35.708
And where's Vega?

01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:39.084
Don't flatter yourself.
Mr. Vega is a very busy man.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:05.542
(SCOFFS)

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:07.792

those work fine.

But these are too basic.
It's too clean.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:26.125
If you haven't noticed,
it's Caesar Braga.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:28.042
B-R-A-G-A.
It says here, "Barga."

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:30.375
"Barga," not the name.
Not the name.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.457
These...
I'm gonna have to re-do
all of these, guys.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:35.042
No, it's Braga, like that.
Not Barga like...

01:08:35.042 --> 01:08:36.167

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:37.792

are you?

but everyone just
calls me Creech.

can I help you?

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:47.457

to deliver this to you.

Yes, sir.

Yeah? Can I help you?

of wondering here...

No. No. No.

it says "Barga"?

just get out
of here! Please!

talking about here.
Okay, even a fucking...

You gotta look at it.
Look at it.

Did you dig up anything?

I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

harder. Okay?

dig up the whole
fucking Internet.

Find something.
Bring it back.

I've thrown more money
into this thing than
in my last five fights

01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:58.209
and still I can't move
the fucking needle.

01:11:58.209 --> 01:12:02.042
Fans just don't
wanna see this fight,
simple as that.

01:12:02.042 --> 01:12:05.875
Fans don't wanna
see Brody James fight,
that's the problem.

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:09.041
He's done. He's over,
he's yesterday's news.

01:12:09.041 --> 01:12:11.000
I hear he's looking
a lot better, boss.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.458
It's too little.
Too late.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.291
Now, Case Walker...

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:19.500
It's different story with
that Internet cop thing.

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.959
What if...

01:12:23.959 --> 01:12:25.000
What are you
thinking?

01:12:36.417 --> 01:12:38.542
Mr. Case?
Mr. Case!

01:12:40.667 --> 01:12:41.834
What?

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:43.792
Mr. Walker,
your video has exploded.

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.583
Do you think its popularity
is a symbolic response

01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:48.458
to police brutality
in your country?

01:12:48.458 --> 01:12:51.667
No comment. Now could you
people move back, please.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.625
Just answer that, please.

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:56.667
You have seen
the video, right?

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:59.458
REPORTER: Okay, back up...
Back up. Back up.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:02.583
All right, everyone,
I'm Myca Cruz,
Mr. Walker's publicist.

01:13:02.583 --> 01:13:04.125
He will not be
answering any questions

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.125
or conducting
interviews at this time.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:09.084

go through my office,

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:25.041
So, what do you think?

01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:28.834
Wow. This is really nice.
But whose is it?

01:13:30.417 --> 01:13:32.417
No strings attached, Case.

01:13:32.417 --> 01:13:34.208
It's Vega's way of
showing his appreciation

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.917
for everything
you've done for Brody.

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:37.500
Twenty-four-hour
security guards.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.250
No one's getting in here
without your permission.

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.708
Or Vega's.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.917
He's trying to help.

01:13:43.917 --> 01:13:46.959
Look, I'm just
around the corner
if you need me.

01:13:46.959 --> 01:13:50.042
I'm sure your services
don't come cheap.

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:55.542
Case, I'm trying
to help as a friend,
if that's okay with you.

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:58.500
Well, okay.
I'll go get my stuff.

01:14:03.875 --> 01:14:05.041
Thank you.

Hey, Matty,
who's this guy?

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:57.917
Sambo guy,
supposed to help
Brody with his leg locks.

01:14:57.917 --> 01:15:00.125
Used to fight
in Pride.

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:01.083
Did you send for him?

01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:02.959
No, he's local.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.792
What's the matter?

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:07.167
He just pops up
outta nowhere

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:08.959
and he's working with
a number one contender?

01:15:08.959 --> 01:15:11.417
Now you know how I felt
when you walked in.

01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:12.959
Come on, man,

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:15.125
what's a Russian
Sambo specialist
doing in Bangkok?

01:15:15.125 --> 01:15:16.708
And he just happens
to come to this gym?

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:18.333
Come on, man,
something doesn't fit.

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:22.000
Yeah, not like
a 250-pound

take it down a notch,

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:25.917
come on you got one week
before the fight, Brody.

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:27.041
I'm only 230.

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.917

MATTY:
What the hell happened?

01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:34.083
I had him in a heel-hook
and he spun the wrong way.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.375
What?

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.375
Fuck, it was an accident,
Brody moved.

01:15:37.375 --> 01:15:39.542

Somebody get some ice!

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:48.875
We're waiting for
the nurse to come back
with his release papers.

01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.417
He won't need surgery,

01:15:50.417 --> 01:15:53.084
but he's gonna be out
for the next eight
to 12 weeks at least.

01:15:53.084 --> 01:15:54.417
Oh, God.

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:56.041
I gotta call Hugo.

01:15:58.041 --> 01:16:01.208
Oh, champ, I'm so sorry.
You'll bounce back.

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:03.000
We'll reschedule
your fight.

01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:05.917
Vega needs this
fight more than I do.

01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:07.708
He's not going
to reschedule it.

01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:12.209
Now, I gotta
fuckin' pay for re-hab.
I'm gonna lose my house.

01:16:12.209 --> 01:16:14.166
No, Brody, you forgot.
You have insurance now.

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:15.333
The hell I do.

01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm not gonna qualify, Case.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.542
Well, why not?

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:22.667
Because I've been
taking steroids, all right?
The whole time.

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:25.792
I've been on them
since the beginning
of the camp.

01:16:25.792 --> 01:16:28.750
How do you think
I got in shape
so quick?

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:31.125
You mean these steroids?

01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:34.125
Well, see these...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.875
These are just
crushed up baby aspirin.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:44.291
And these,
saline solution with
a little food coloring.

01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:46.542
You know, Matty,
you need to change those locks

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.291
'cause they're
a little too easy to break.

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.625
Yeah, he switched them out
a long time ago.

01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:52.042
You knew about this?

01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:54.208
Yeah, he told me
a couple weeks ago.

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:57.542
But, it was
actually kind of funny
watching you get stronger,

01:16:57.542 --> 01:17:00.083
thinking all the while
it was some kind of drug.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:04.250
You believed it,
so you achieved it.
All the while it was just you.

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.167
Motherfucker.

somebody told him
he had to move out?

out of commission,
and the fight off...

going to happen.

after the fight.

in your contract.

are in business.

my brother?

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.291

went viral weeks ago.

Walker's unlikely victory
against four armed policemen

that Brody's not fighting
that animal.

Well, I'm just relieved
that I have his consent.

if you go out
there and whip his ass.

before I do something nasty
with these crutches.

to scout you out

done hitting mitts.

you're the one who said
you wouldn't fight for Vega.

01:21:58.041 --> 01:22:01.959
(SCOFFS) Yeah, but, I mean,
these are my terms.

But I will promise you this.

01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:08.625
Hugo Vega pulls strings
at many different levels.

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:12.250

on this fight
or he loses everything.

was the best thing

happened to Hugo Vega.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500

to practice leg locks

I want to learn.

What? Who?

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.125
Vega. How much he pay you
to take out Brody's leg?

01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:44.917
Get the fuck outta here.
It was an accident.

01:23:44.917 --> 01:23:47.083
I had Brody in a heel-lock
and he spun the wrong way.

01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:48.834
You're a fuckin' liar.

01:23:48.834 --> 01:23:50.917
What the fuck you doing'
with my phone?

01:23:50.917 --> 01:23:53.167
You sent a two-word text,

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:55.166
10 minutes after
your session with Brody.

01:23:55.166 --> 01:23:56.583

You fuckin' serious?
Put your hands down.

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:15.083
I'm definitely not going
to the cops with this.

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.125
Vega's the one
that needs to suffer.

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:18.542
Way I see it,

01:24:18.542 --> 01:24:22.333
the way we beat Vega
is by Case beating his man.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:23.625
That's how we hurt him.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:26.167
Exactly.
And after you defeat Braga,

01:24:26.167 --> 01:24:27.834
sign with
a different promoter.

01:24:27.834 --> 01:24:30.583
You'd be the champ then,
you call the shots.

01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.917
But then Vega still makes
a shitload of money

01:24:32.917 --> 01:24:35.500
and gets away with
what he did to Brody.

(SIGHS)

01:24:36.834 --> 01:24:39.250
I could just walk away
and not fight.

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.208
Yeah, that would
screw him royally.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:42.625
But then you'd be

after the fight.

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:45.875

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:49.042
Come on, Case,
beat Braga.

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:51.542
What? Win the battle,
not the war?

01:24:51.542 --> 01:24:54.500
Look, sometimes
you gotta just
take half a victory.

01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:52.500
for getting Boris
to take out Brody's leg.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.125
Yeah, we got
your payment transaction

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:56.041
as well as your phone records.
Don't we?

01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:57.542

01:35:57.542 --> 01:36:00.041
No. What are you
talking about?

01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:02.000

an extra million

would be good
for Brody and his family.

01:36:03.917 --> 01:36:06.291
That's unless you
want him to sue you
for punitive damages,

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:08.500
which will cost you more like
$5 million when he's done.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.041
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just wait.

01:36:10.041 --> 01:36:12.458
Let's just talk about
this because... What?

01:36:12.458 --> 01:36:14.250
Every dollar boss.
What?

01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:18.667

every fucking dollar!

Excuse us.

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.333
