(NARRATOR READING)

02:28.616 --> 02:30.951
Is it time to check the
ham yet?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.986
Yeah. It's been about
two hours.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.922
Good. After you spread
the brown sugar on,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.557
put some of that
pineapple on top.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.996
Florence, aren't you
forgetting something?

02:43.063 --> 02:46.700
Huh? Oh, yeah. Put a few
of them little cherries
on top, too.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.472
I mean, aren't you
forgetting who the cook
is around here?

02:51.539 --> 02:53.874
Oh, that's okay, Mrs.
Jefferson. I don't mind
if you help out.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.044
(DOORBELL RINGING)

02:58.646 --> 03:01.181
Would you mind getting
the door, Florence?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.683
Oh, no, of course not.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.386
I'll get it.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.855
Gee, you all don't let me
do nothing around here.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.659
-George!
-Dusty!

03:11.725 --> 03:13.261
(LAUGHING) Hey, cousin!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.696
Dusty, Dusty,
how about this?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.698
Dusty, Dusty. (LAUGHING)

03:17.765 --> 03:19.567
-Hey, guess who's here.
-Don't tell me.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.834
Dusty.

03:22.236 --> 03:25.606
Dusty Jefferson!
I don't believe it!

03:25.673 --> 03:29.042
-I don't believe you, honey!
-(LAUGHING)

03:29.109 --> 03:32.079
Hey, when are you gonna
dump this turkey and run off
with me, huh?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.685
Florence, this is
George's cousin.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.152
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.555
Hey, Weezy, Dusty ain't
just my cousin. He's my
main cousin.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.391
-We were tighter than
brothers. Right, Dust?
-You got it, George.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.326
Hey!

03:45.393 --> 03:47.194
Yeah, when we was growing up,
I used to tell everybody
we was twins.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.496
Really?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.599
Dusty, were you
that ugly as a child?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.436
Yeah. But I improved.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.471
(LAUGHS)

03:57.538 --> 03:59.673
Come on, Florence, let's
go get dinner ready.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.842
Okay, Mrs. Jefferson.
And I'll make sure you
do it right.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.515
Boy, we sure
had some great times,
didn't we, George?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.450
Yeah, man. They can take
a lot away from a man,

04:09.517 --> 04:11.419
-but they can't take away
his memories.
-Right.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.355
-Hey, I remember the time
you saved my skin.
-When was that?

04:14.422 --> 04:17.425
Well, you know, you lent me
that hundred bucks to buy
Weezy an engagement ring?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.792
Anybody would have done
that, George.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.428
Yeah, but you're the only
one who did it.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.663
And you know something?
With all the money
we got today,

04:22.730 --> 04:25.098
-Weezy still hangs on to
that old ring.
-Really?

04:25.165 --> 04:27.468
You know, man,
it's been quite a while,
but you're still looking good.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.836
Yeah, you're looking
good, too, Dust.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.605
Well, maybe on the outside.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.206
Well, nobody looks good
on the inside.

04:35.142 --> 04:39.413
Especially me.
Remember that automobile
accident I had?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.082
-Yeah.
-Messed up one of my
kidneys.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.817
Oh, yeah? Well, you still
got the rest of them,
don't you?

04:46.153 --> 04:48.422
George, a person only
has two kidneys.

04:48.489 --> 04:52.326
Well, one out of two
ain't bad! You're still
battin' five hundred.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.528
Well, except now that
kidney's going bad.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.964
I have to go to dialysis
three times a week.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.099
You gotta go to Dallas,
Texas three times a week?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.504
Not Dallas, dialysis.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.806
It's a machine
that they hook me up to.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.909
Takes the place of my
kidney. Cleans my blood.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.711
Oh, that's a drag.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.913
Yeah, and especially when
you're on the road
a lot, selling.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.848
I may have to look
for a new job.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.118
Well, look, you ain't gotta
look no further. If it's a job
you want, you got it.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.821
Well, I'll tell you,
there is something I need
from you, George,

05:20.888 --> 05:22.823
but it ain't a job.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.993
-Hey, look, if it's money...
-No, George,
I don't need money.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.396
Well, whatever I got is yours.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.898
-Honest?
-Just ask.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.500
Well, how 'bout giving me
one of your kidneys?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.773
(LAUGHING)

05:39.840 --> 05:41.809
Hey, you know something,
for a minute I thought
you was serious.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.280
I am serious. I need
a kidney transplant.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.983
Are you jiving?
You want me to give you
one of my kidneys?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.653
No... No, George, your
kidneys are down here.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.590
You really want my kidney?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.826
Believe me, George,
I hate asking this.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.995
Not as much
as I hate hearing it.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.566
But my only other choice
is to wait till somebody
dies and donates a kidney.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.968
Oh, well, cheer up,
people are dying all the time.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.739
But I have to find one
that matches mine.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.173
Oh, I'm sure ours
ain't gonna match.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.409
Look, you're six feet tall,
I'm only 5'6".

06:16.844 --> 06:18.311
No, George, what I mean is,

06:18.378 --> 06:22.215
is we stand a good chance
of matching because
we're closely related.

06:22.282 --> 06:25.653
Yeah, but, Dusty, man,
I ain't never had an
operation in my life.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.488
I didn't even go to the
hospital when I was born.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.493
It's pretty simple to
remove a kidney, George.
It's just snip, snip.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.595
Snip, snip? Oh...

06:36.196 --> 06:40.000
Look, George, I know what
I'm asking is pretty heavy.
And if,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.635
if you don't wanna do it,
I'll understand.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.871
Look, I didn't say
I didn't wanna do it.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.674
But asking for my, for a
kidney ain't like bumming
a cigarette.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.411
Now look, why don't you think
about it for a while, okay?

06:51.479 --> 06:55.248
Now if you decide to do it,
you call Dr. Feller at
Manhattan Medical Center.

06:55.315 --> 06:58.051
He'll give you
a blood test to see
if our kidneys match.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.352
Here's his phone number.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.956
Hmm... Thanks, Dust.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.927
Uh, and if you wanna call me,
I'll be staying in Brooklyn
with my brother Bob.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.230
Bob? Hey, that's right.
Why don't you ask Bob to
give you a kidney?

07:10.297 --> 07:12.165
Well he can't,
he's got diabetes.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.333
Damn!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.037
He always was lucky.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.541
Well, I gotta go.
Goodbye, Louise.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.911
Can't you stay for dinner?

07:23.977 --> 07:26.580
Oh, I'm sorry I can't.
Let's make it
another night, okay?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.949
-Let's make it soon.
-Right.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.753
And whatever you
decide, George, you know,
I'll understand, man.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.022
You're still my main cousin.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.090
-Hey, Dust. Later.
-Right, later.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.664
Kidney...
Some cousin he is.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.968
-George.
-Yeah?

07:48.035 --> 07:50.604
-Did Dusty want something?
-Want something?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.472
Oh, no,
he just wanted to talk.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.774
Talk? About what?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.176
About something he's missing.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.646
Missing?

07:58.712 --> 08:01.682
Yeah... He's missing the
good old days.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.953
Oh, yeah, we did have some
good times with Dusty,
didn't we?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.588
They weren't that good.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.624
What do you mean?

08:10.691 --> 08:13.627
I mean every time
we went for a ride,
he had to come along.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.896
George, it was Dusty's car.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.200
Stingy turkey...

08:20.267 --> 08:22.803
-Stingy?
-Yeah, he even made me pay
for gas once.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.807
George, remember
that night you

08:26.874 --> 08:29.743
borrowed Dusty's car
and we rode to the beach?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.845
Yeah.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.948
-Remember what I told
you that night?
-Yeah.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.517
-"Not until we marry."
-George!

08:41.188 --> 08:43.523
That was the first night

08:43.591 --> 08:47.027
-I told you I loved you.
-Oh, yeah.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.597
Then I said,
"Not until we are married."

08:51.064 --> 08:53.233
-Mrs. Jefferson?
-Yes, Florence.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.535
-I need some help.
-You are the help, dummy!

08:58.471 --> 08:59.873
I'll be right there, Florence.

09:02.309 --> 09:06.046
George, is something
bothering you?

09:06.113 --> 09:09.783
Oh, I don't know, Weezy.
Seeing Dusty again just
made me think.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.652
Think about what?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.220
Maybe him and me
are too close.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.524
-What?
-I mean, look, Weezy,
we're only cousins.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.159
It ain't like we're
brothers or nothing.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.994
But, George, you just said...

09:21.061 --> 09:23.797
Hurry up, Mrs. Jefferson,
I can't get the ham out
of the oven!

09:23.864 --> 09:25.565
-You better go help her, Weez.
-But, George...

09:25.633 --> 09:28.602
Go on! Look, now you tell
Florence if she burns
that ham,

09:28.669 --> 09:29.870
I'm burning her paycheck.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.976
Hi, Mr. Jefferson.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.310
Hi, Alan.
You got diabetes?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.752
(CHUCKLES) No. Why?

09:44.818 --> 09:48.155
Well, look, let me
ask you something.

09:48.221 --> 09:52.292
Supposing I came up to you
and asked you for a part of
your body. What would you say?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.863
Depends on what
she looks like.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.866
No, no, like if, if
somebody needed a kidney,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.134
so they wouldn't have to
be hooked up to a machine
all the time,

10:01.201 --> 10:02.235
would you give them one?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.539
Man, that's a tough
question, Mr. Jefferson.

10:07.908 --> 10:11.845
I mean, if it were
a close friend,

10:11.912 --> 10:13.647
yeah, I guess
I'd wanna do it.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.383
-You would? Great.
-But I'd be scared.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.585
Scared? What is there to
be scared of?

10:18.652 --> 10:22.155
I mean, if your kidney matches
his, it's a very simple
operation, just snip, snip.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.326
Why you asking me this?

10:26.393 --> 10:30.630
Well, Dusty, I mean, this
person who needs this
kidney...

10:30.698 --> 10:32.700
-George?
-Shh!

10:32.766 --> 10:34.902
-Oh, hi, Alan.
-Hi, Mrs. Jefferson.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.070
George, about Dusty...

10:37.137 --> 10:39.472
-Dusty?
-Yes. George's cousin.

10:39.539 --> 10:43.110
George's cousin? Is that
the one who needs a
kidney transplant?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.978
Quiet, Zebra.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.817
Kidney transplant?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.685
George, what's Alan saying?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.721
Who knows? I don't
understand zebrish.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.627
You are hiding something,
George. I want you to
tell me the truth.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.766
Okay, Weez...

11:07.534 --> 11:09.536
Lou Rawls is my
favorite singer.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.472
-George!
-Well, that's the truth.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.308
I want the truth
about Dusty. Now!

11:15.375 --> 11:18.311
Okay. Dusty asked me to give
him one of my kidneys.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.480
He what?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.582
Yeah. He's only got one
and it ain't working.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.084
-What's wrong with it?
-It's broke!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.757
It needs some more screws!
How should I know
what's wrong with it?

11:32.325 --> 11:36.163
Damn... Why did this
have to happen to Dusty?

11:36.229 --> 11:40.700
George, does Dusty really
expect you to give him
one of your kidneys?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.269
Yeah!

11:42.335 --> 11:43.837
Well, what are you gonna do?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.873
I'm gonna do what anybody else
in this situation would do.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.140
I'm gonna have a drink.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.043
-Hi, Weez.
-Oh, hi, George. Where
have you been?

13:30.110 --> 13:34.147
Oh... I just went to have
a little talk with
Dusty's doctor.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.117
What? Why?

13:37.184 --> 13:39.119
Well, you know,
I just wanted to, uh,

13:39.186 --> 13:43.056
have the blood test just
to see if my kidney
matched Dusty's.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.993
But I thought we decided
you weren't going to give
him one!

13:46.059 --> 13:48.795
-I ain't, I ain't.
-Then why did you
take the test?

13:49.997 --> 13:52.132
So I won't have to tell
Dusty I can't do it.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.766
He can't blame me
if they don't match.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.069
But what if they do match?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.905
Bite your tongue.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.640
I took out a little insurance.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.475
I slipped the doctor's
nurse a $10 bill.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.749
You bribed a nurse?

14:09.816 --> 14:11.384
Yeah. I just said,
"Listen, baby,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.686
"you and me both know that
that rabbit ain't gonna
die, right?"

14:16.189 --> 14:18.158
That's for pregnancy.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.726
Same thing.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.028
What?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.795
They're both for something
that's got to come out.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.034
When are you gonna get
the test results?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.069
Well, they're supposed to
phone me as soon as it
comes through.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.603
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-But, George...

14:30.670 --> 14:32.172
Don't worry, Weez...

14:35.642 --> 14:37.510
Hello, Louise.
Is George here?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.113
-Yes, he just got home
from the doctor's.
-The doctor's?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.881
Then he's really gonna do it.

14:41.949 --> 14:45.152
-Uh, now, Helen...
-George, George, George!

14:47.420 --> 14:49.189
George!

14:50.057 --> 14:51.191
Stop, Willis.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.995
Oh, Alan told us about
your cousin.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.498
That's right, George.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.069
-We're, we're so proud
to know you.
-(GEORGE GRUNTS)

15:04.004 --> 15:05.538
I wish I could say
the same thing.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.774
It's like being neighbors with
a couple of octopuses.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.145
Oh, George,
you can't fool us.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.747
You may act mean, but we know
that deep down inside

15:14.814 --> 15:18.318
you're a sweet, warm,
courageous human being!

15:18.385 --> 15:20.253
No, I'm not!

15:20.320 --> 15:22.189
Oh, Louise, you must be
so proud of him.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.524
-Well, actually...
-Modesty runs in the family.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.260
-Well, why don't you run
your family out of here?
-Oh...

15:27.327 --> 15:31.431
Oh, I understand, George.
You don't want people
admiring you.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.400
Spoken like a real hero.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.003
Spoken like a real
knuckle head.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.638
Oh, it takes a big man to
do what you're doing, George.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.441
Yes, but you're doing
it anyway.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.043
Why don't you two
get out of here?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.412
-All right, George,
we'll leave.
-Good.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.481
George, we realize now
that when you get mad
and throw us out,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.683
you're really showing us
how much you like us.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.853
Like you? Well, hell, let
me show you how much
I love you!

15:58.225 --> 16:01.261
-George, that was...
-(PHONE RINGING)

16:02.662 --> 16:04.231
That might be from
the doctor's office.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.668
-Well, aren't you gonna
answer it?
-Why don't you answer it?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.338
You're closer.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.807
Hello.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.643
Oh, Dr. Feller's office.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.311
Yeah, this is
George Jefferson.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.281
Oh, you already gave
Dusty the results?

16:22.782 --> 16:25.085
Oh, no, no, you don't have
to give them to me right away.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.419
Why don't you just mail
them to me?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.023
What? What?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.227
Oh, thanks.
(LAUGHING)

16:34.294 --> 16:36.463
It didn't match!
It didn't match!

16:36.529 --> 16:40.133
It didn't match!
It didn't match, Weez!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.335
George, what a relief.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.205
I told you everything was
gonna be fine. Phew.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.374
Except for Dusty.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.109
Well, I tried, Weezy.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.711
But the tests showed that
I only got two
out of four markers.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.081
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-Two out of four markers?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.615
What does that mean?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.851
Well, four out of four
markers is a perfect match.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.254
Which means my
kidney is gonna stay
right where it is.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.955
(LAUGHING)

17:03.022 --> 17:05.925
-Oh, Dusty, hi.
-Hi, Louise.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.428
Hey, George, I just got the
news from the doctor.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.097
Yeah, me, too.
I'm sorry, Dusty.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.231
What do you mean?

17:12.499 --> 17:13.933
Your kidney's a great match.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.169
-It is?
-Yeah.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.770
Two out of four
tissue markers,

17:17.837 --> 17:20.073
plus the fact that we're
closely related,
means we're all set.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.875
-All set?
-Yeah.

17:22.942 --> 17:26.413
Dr. Feller says there's
an 80% chance that my body
will accept your kidney.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.216
Hmm... Well, if your body
don't accept it, can I
get it back?

17:31.151 --> 17:34.687
Oh, I'm afraid not. But
look, you can live fine
on one kidney.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.489
Oh, I don't know
about that, Dusty.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.191
I got a feeling
I'm a two-kidney man.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.094
I go to the bathroom a lot.

17:43.596 --> 17:47.434
You're a great kidder, George.
Well, I gotta get down
to Dr. Feller's office.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.237
Oh, I knew I could count
on you, bro!

17:50.303 --> 17:51.604
(LAUGHING)

17:52.439 --> 17:53.906
I'll see you all later.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.814
George, Dusty thinks
you're gonna give him one
of your kidneys.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.516
Yeah.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.985
Where'd he get
a dumb idea like that?

18:06.052 --> 18:08.888
From you. You should have
told him the truth.

18:08.955 --> 18:12.359
Oh, I can't tell him,
Weezy. Me and Dusty are
real close.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.494
You want me to tell him?

18:14.561 --> 18:19.232
No. My cousin, my kidney,
my problem.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.130
Who's that? Who's there?

18:51.198 --> 18:53.733
There's someone in the
bedroom! George!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.235
-Hold it, hold it, hold it.
-There's somebody in the room!

18:55.302 --> 18:57.437
Okay, hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it. It's
me. It's me.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.907
Oh... Oh, George.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.042
You scared me to death.
(EXHALES)

19:05.077 --> 19:07.547
Have you been talking to Dusty
all this time?

19:07.614 --> 19:10.750
Yeah. And you have no
idea how hard it was.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.919
Well, did the two of you
get everything settled?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.854
Oh, yeah, we got
everything settled.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.290
-And he's not mad at you?
-No.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.760
In fact, he shook my hand and
said, "You're the greatest."
(CHUCKLING)

19:20.827 --> 19:24.697
Well, I'm glad Dusty
realized you did the only
thing you could.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.833
Yeah, well, I just hope
you realize it, too, Weez.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.968
Of course, I do.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.571
And Dusty will get over it
in a few months.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.040
In a few months? He should be
up and around in a few weeks.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.976
Up and around?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.912
Well, George,
you almost sound like,

19:39.979 --> 19:42.482
like you decided to go
through with the transplant.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.418
George.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.087
George, you're not!

19:48.154 --> 19:50.323
Wrong, Weezy, I am.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.025
But we decided that
you wouldn't.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.094
-Look, Weez...
-George, you're mine.

19:55.161 --> 19:59.399
All of you. I don't want bits
of you floating around in
other people.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.372
When I first married you,
you didn't have
all your parts.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.310
What?

20:10.377 --> 20:13.079
I mean, you didn't hear
me complaining. And you
had two parts missing.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.283
-What?
-Your tonsils.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.851
Oh, George!

20:18.918 --> 20:22.722
Look, Weezy, it's my
kidney, and I can do
whatever I want with it.

20:22.789 --> 20:26.225
Oh, and to hell with what
I want, right?

20:26.293 --> 20:29.662
George, that is
a serious operation.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.600
You could...
Well, what if you...

20:33.666 --> 20:36.202
Oh, Dusty can live if you
don't give him a kidney.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.237
But I can't.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.172
Huh?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.675
Look, Weezy,
Dusty is a Jefferson.
He's blood.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.345
Now if I got a chance to
help him and I don't do it,

20:45.412 --> 20:47.246
then I can't live with myself.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.182
Well, I'm blood, too.
I'm your wife.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.519
Who's more important to you?
Your wife or your cousin?

20:54.220 --> 20:56.356
George, I'm not through
talking about this!

20:56.423 --> 20:58.190
When you are, let me
know. I'll come back.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.229
Well, you're not the only
one who can run out
on a conversation!

21:05.398 --> 21:06.599
Oh, Florence!

21:10.503 --> 21:12.872
Have you been listening
all this time?

21:12.939 --> 21:15.141
No, I think I missed
a couple of minutes.
What happened?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.246
George wants to have
the operation.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.182
You oughta be
real proud of him.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.486
You know, I was wrong
about Mr. Jefferson.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.155
I used to think the biggest
part of him was his mouth.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.692
-What?
-But it ain't nearly
as big as his heart.

21:32.759 --> 21:36.162
But he went and made this
decision without even
consulting me!

21:36.228 --> 21:37.597
Yeah, ain't that something?

21:37.664 --> 21:40.867
He didn't even give you
a chance to talk him
out of it.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.003
You got yourself a real man,
Mrs. Jefferson.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.139
And right now, he don't need
you to be mad at him.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.075
He needs all the support you
can give him.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.380
Yeah, I guess you're right.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.581
Of course I'm right.

21:57.049 --> 22:01.488
Florence, sometimes
I wonder how you come up
with such good advice.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.255
Easy. I watch The Waltons.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.433
George.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.102
Don't try to talk me out
of it, Weezy. I made my
decision.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.105
I know, George.
And I'm proud of you.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.674
I gave it a lot of
thought, and I figured...

22:24.677 --> 22:27.780
-What'd you say?
-I said, I'm proud of you.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.217
You're doing the right thing.
And I'm with you all the way.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.820
Oh... Well, what made you
change your mind?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.589
Florence watches The Waltons.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.258
Huh?

22:39.325 --> 22:41.861
I just realized I was
being selfish, George.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.032
When is he gonna do it?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.168
Tomorrow.

22:49.235 --> 22:53.606
Tomorrow? Oh, that's the
day after today!

22:53.673 --> 22:55.742
Weezy, everything is
gonna be all right. I promise.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.810
But come on, please,
let's get some sleep.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.847
I gotta be at the
doctor's office at 7:00.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.883
Well, did the doctor
say how long you'd
be in the hospital?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.519
Well, I should be out of
the hospital in about
three days.

23:06.586 --> 23:10.557
And I should be back to normal
in about two to three weeks.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.126
Well, did he say how long
it would be before you
and I could...

23:15.127 --> 23:16.128
You know...

23:18.731 --> 23:21.167
Oh, yeah, I asked about
that. He said as soon as
I felt like it.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.070
That long?

23:33.813 --> 23:35.982
-Goodnight, George.
-Goodnight, Weez.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.953
If you're all through
talking, I'm going to
bed, too. Goodnight.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.066
-George?
-Hmm?

23:55.401 --> 23:58.905
-I'm scared.
-Me, too.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.243
-I thought you all was
through talking?
-Get out of here!

24:09.315 --> 24:11.551
Helen, hurry up.
Raise it a little higher.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.952
Oh, yeah, that,
that's perfect, dear...

24:15.555 --> 24:18.925
They're here!
They're here!
Come on, hurry up.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.194
-Shh! Shh! Shh!
-Alan, now take it easy.
Take it easy.

24:22.261 --> 24:25.197
Weezy, now you ain't got
to help me. I said I'm
all right.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.033
ALL: Welcome home, George!

24:27.099 --> 24:29.235
Hey, I get out of the
hospital okay,

24:29.301 --> 24:30.737
so I come home and they
give me a heart attack.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.171
(LAUGHING)

24:32.238 --> 24:34.507
But, George, they're just
happy to see you.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.876
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
I'm so glad you're all right!

24:39.612 --> 24:41.714
Look, the next time you
do that, you give me some
ether first.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.451
Oh, let's sit down, George.

24:45.518 --> 24:49.255
Oh, yes, you don't wanna
overdo the first day.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.323
That's right. You oughta
get plenty of rest.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.392
I ain't tired. I'm all right.

24:53.459 --> 24:54.861
-Sit down.
-Yes.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.429
You sit right down on this.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.031
What's this for?

24:59.098 --> 25:01.300
Well, I wasn't really sure
where they operated, so I...

25:01.367 --> 25:03.435
Look, right over here it is.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.104
Oh, well...

25:05.171 --> 25:07.006
Then maybe
you can use it to go
swimming.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.376
-How's Dusty?
-Oh, he's fine.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.244
The operation was a success.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.446
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Oh, we wondered about that.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.750
Now, you just sit right down
here, Mr. Jefferson. I got
everything all fixed for you.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.485
-Florence...
-No, I insist.

25:19.552 --> 25:23.289
Now, if you want anything,
all you got to do is snap
your fingers.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.057
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, Mr. Jefferson.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.259
We know you're not
feeling too well.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.929
Oh. Oh, yeah, well, I do
feel kind of crummy.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.566
George, if, if there's
anything anyone of us can
get you,

25:33.633 --> 25:35.935
-just name it.
-Hmm...

25:36.002 --> 25:37.604
Now that you mentioned it,

25:37.670 --> 25:40.539
I do have sort of a craving
for one of them
salami sandwiches

25:40.607 --> 25:42.474
from Stefano's Deli.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.045
Stefano's Deli?
That's way across town.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.047
That's all right.
Anything for George.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.750
-Oh...
-Can I do anything, George?

25:50.817 --> 25:53.152
Yeah. Why don't you go
with him and make sure he
don't forget the mustard.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.187
-Great.
-What about me?

25:55.254 --> 25:57.356
Why don't you run down to
the corner and get me
some vanilla ice cream?

25:57.423 --> 25:59.291
You got it.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.860
-Hey, Florence?
-Yes, sir?

26:00.927 --> 26:02.829
Run out into the kitchen
and bake me an apple pie.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.797
All right. You just sit
right there and relax and
don't you move.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.769
You know, that's the
first time I've ever seen
Florence run.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.641
George, what are you up to?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.242
Come here
and sit down, Weez.

26:21.013 --> 26:25.184
Remember what the
doctor said about what we
could do when I felt like it.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.520
George, surely you're not
ready for that yet.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.790
Maybe not.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.925
But it wouldn't hurt to start
getting in shape.

26:32.992 --> 26:33.993
(LAUGHS)

28:30.309 --> 28:34.546
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.117
* Movin', movin on up
