WEBVTT

00:00.913 --> 00:02.182
Previously on The Resident...

00:05.841 --> 00:07.409
We can all agree

00:07.443 --> 00:10.546
- it was the misdosed sevo.
- That's never gonna fly.

00:10.579 --> 00:12.147
I covered for you.
Not this time.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.583
We cannot handle
one more lawsuit.

00:14.616 --> 00:15.817
I have installed
recording devices

00:15.851 --> 00:17.919
on every camera in every OR.

00:17.953 --> 00:19.154
Doctors must support each other

00:19.187 --> 00:21.490
through good times and bad.

00:21.523 --> 00:23.225
Time of death, 21:58

00:23.259 --> 00:24.693
I don't understand.

00:24.726 --> 00:27.162
She was stable last night
when I left my shift.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.366
I went home, I left her alone.

00:30.399 --> 00:31.967
I should have stayed here.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.172
Healing hands
and the spirit of care.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.375
Chastain Memorial Hospital.

00:39.408 --> 00:42.244
Incredible things
are happening here.

00:42.278 --> 00:44.045
You got to be kidding me.

00:44.079 --> 00:45.581
Incredible things?

00:45.614 --> 00:46.715
Wow.

00:47.749 --> 00:49.285
Hey.

00:49.318 --> 00:51.520
Mina told me to find you.

00:51.553 --> 00:54.022
Dr. Bell just started the lipoma
excision on your patient.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.258
- Turner was scheduled for that.
- Yeah.

00:56.292 --> 00:57.459
He's out sick. Stomach flu.

00:57.493 --> 00:58.794
Wait, that's TJ's surgery.

00:58.827 --> 01:00.429
Doesn't he have
a latex sensitivity?

01:00.462 --> 01:02.464
You're right. I need
to check on him, and Bell.

01:02.498 --> 01:05.266
Hey.

01:05.301 --> 01:06.368
Go easy on your ankle today.

01:06.402 --> 01:08.036
What ankle?

01:08.069 --> 01:09.070
the spirit of care.

01:09.104 --> 01:11.273
Chastain Memorial Hospital.

01:11.307 --> 01:14.242
Incredible things
are happening here.

01:14.276 --> 01:15.477
Pickups.

01:17.513 --> 01:19.481
- Give him five, imidazoline.
- Anyone seen

01:19.515 --> 01:20.482
the new hospital promo?

01:20.516 --> 01:22.117
Oh, I saw it.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.985
You're fantastic, Dr. Bell.

01:24.019 --> 01:26.388
What about you, Dr. Okafor?

01:26.422 --> 01:28.590
You're in it.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.264
Silk.

01:40.969 --> 01:42.103
How much longer?

01:42.137 --> 01:43.472
Just have to close up.

01:43.505 --> 01:45.674
Some bleeding posteriorly.

01:45.707 --> 01:47.142
Yeah, I got it.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.777
Cautery.

01:48.810 --> 01:52.314
Set to 40:40 blend point.

01:52.348 --> 01:53.549
Mm-hmm.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.587
Damn it.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.922
Shut off the oxygen.
Look, I got to keep sterile

02:00.956 --> 02:03.258
so I can close the patient.
Get the O2 off!

02:05.060 --> 02:08.830
- Get that O2 mask off.
- Rip the drapes down.

02:08.864 --> 02:11.467
More oxygen might be
hiding beneath them.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.237
Hey, Mina, I need you sterile.

02:17.973 --> 02:19.641
Paul. Paul,
I need you to bag him.

02:23.579 --> 02:25.347
It's still open.
I got to cover the incision.

02:25.381 --> 02:27.215
Can't let him get hypothermic.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.018
Someone get those sprinklers
turned off!

02:30.051 --> 02:33.188
Incredible things
are happening here.

02:40.221 --> 02:42.223

02:47.703 --> 02:49.671
Sorry for the wait, Nurse Nevin.

02:49.705 --> 02:51.607
Ms. Thorpe can see you now.

02:55.110 --> 02:56.912
Please, come in.

02:56.945 --> 02:59.848
- This is Joshua Williams,
head of risk management. -Hi.

03:01.216 --> 03:03.552
Um, what is this about?

03:03.585 --> 03:06.187
Unfortunately,
we have some bad news. Please.

03:10.926 --> 03:14.496
Lily's family is suing
the hospital for wrongful death.

03:14.530 --> 03:15.897
And you're named in the suit.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.401
Uh, I don't understand.

03:19.435 --> 03:21.202
- Just me?
- No.

03:21.236 --> 03:23.672
However, risk management
has to do their investigation,

03:23.705 --> 03:26.875
and until its over, we have to
ask you to stop seeing patients.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.278
Has Lily's autopsy come back?

03:30.311 --> 03:33.014
We'll go over all the details
during the investigation.

03:33.048 --> 03:35.451
Ms. Thorpe.

03:35.484 --> 03:36.752
There's been an emergency
in the OR.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.421
A patient caught fire.

03:41.089 --> 03:43.459
You've done enough damage,
I've got it from here.

03:43.492 --> 03:45.427
I'm his surgeon, you're an
internist. What are you even

03:45.461 --> 03:46.928
- doing on the OR floor?
- He had a latex allergy.

03:46.962 --> 03:48.363
I was double-checking nothing
was missed.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.899
- The proper precautions were taken.
- What happened?

03:50.932 --> 03:52.968
Your chief of surgery
just set a patient on fire.

03:53.001 --> 03:54.536
Look, I've just had it.
I've had it with you!

03:54.570 --> 03:56.204
- Challenging me at every corner.
- Not now. Dr. Hawkins,

03:56.237 --> 03:58.106
go to the ICU;
Dr. Bell, a word.

03:59.741 --> 04:01.710
What the hell happened in there?

04:01.743 --> 04:03.879
Well, it's unclear,
but it wasn't my fault.

04:03.912 --> 04:07.616
Oh, just like Mr. Zhou's post-op
bleeding wasn't your fault?

04:07.649 --> 04:09.785
I don't know
what you think you know.

04:09.818 --> 04:11.820
You know what I know?
Is that I have recording devices

04:11.853 --> 04:13.722
in every OR,
so I'm gonna find out exactly

04:13.755 --> 04:14.856
what caused that fire.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.500 --> 04:26.668
Are you okay?

04:26.702 --> 04:29.104
Yeah, the surgery
went perfectly.

04:29.137 --> 04:31.773
I... the resection was done.

04:31.807 --> 04:35.977
And I-I was,
I was closing, and then...

04:36.011 --> 04:37.979
You're not to blame.

04:38.013 --> 04:40.616
I mean, doctors are only as good
as our support staff...

04:40.649 --> 04:43.519
I use a cautery
in every surgery.

04:43.552 --> 04:46.321
This has never happened before.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.289
Don't worry,
the truth will come out.

04:48.323 --> 04:50.826
The truth... it's relative.
It-it looks like my fault.

04:50.859 --> 04:53.294
Worst case, the hospital settles
with the patient.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.533
That's a... like,
another lawsuit.

04:57.566 --> 04:58.634
Randolph.

05:00.201 --> 05:02.103
The board reveres you.

05:02.137 --> 05:05.306
You will survive this.

05:05.340 --> 05:08.309
We will survive this.

05:08.343 --> 05:11.379
Together.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.481
I'm on your side.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.552
Never forget that.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.031
And finally, all charting must
be done immediately

05:30.065 --> 05:32.200
after you see the patient.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.835
I've worked
in the ER before, Irving.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.738
This is your intern year
rotation in the ER.

05:36.772 --> 05:38.974
Today, you're one of us.
Let's start with something

05:39.007 --> 05:41.042
closer to home for an internist.
A nice mystery diagnosis,

05:41.076 --> 05:42.911
Sherlock.

05:46.948 --> 05:48.750
Hi, Olivia Tan?

05:48.784 --> 05:50.351
I'm Dr. Devon Pravesh.

05:50.385 --> 05:51.920
What brings you in today?

05:51.953 --> 05:53.855
I was gargling
with mouthwash this morning,

05:53.889 --> 05:55.523
and I accidentally
swallowed some.

05:55.557 --> 05:57.425
So I called poison control,

05:57.458 --> 05:59.260
and they told me
it was nothing to worry about,

05:59.294 --> 06:02.497
but I think they were just
trying to get me off the phone.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.899
I gargle a lot.

06:03.932 --> 06:06.034
It helps
with my bowel movements.

06:07.569 --> 06:09.504
Got to be conjunctivitis.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.606
Or shingles.

06:10.639 --> 06:12.007
Melanoma?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.175
I think it's a staph infection.

06:14.209 --> 06:15.877
It's a mosquito bite.

06:15.911 --> 06:19.080
And then, my face blew up
like I had a peanut allergy.

06:20.415 --> 06:22.550
Frickin' avocados, man.

06:22.584 --> 06:25.053
That is how my aunt died...

06:25.086 --> 06:27.188
of leprosy.

06:27.222 --> 06:28.890
Right.

06:28.924 --> 06:31.459
You're perfectly healthy.

06:35.997 --> 06:37.966
What's your diagnosis, Harvard?

06:37.999 --> 06:40.201
She's a total nutjob.

06:40.235 --> 06:41.536
I'm discharging her.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.404
Without a thorough workup?

06:43.438 --> 06:46.141
I was as thorough
as humanly possible.

06:46.174 --> 06:48.944
And I've given her
a definitive diagnosis.

06:48.977 --> 06:50.311
- She's a cyberchondriac.
- Hmm.

06:50.345 --> 06:52.113
She surfs WebMD for symptoms,

06:52.147 --> 06:54.582
and she convinces herself
that she has them all.

06:54.616 --> 06:56.785
Not bad, Harvard, not bad.

06:56.818 --> 06:58.319
Now pick one of her complaints

06:58.353 --> 06:59.988
and write her some sort
of placebo prescription

07:00.021 --> 07:01.489
before you discharge her.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.925
Why would I do that?
She's perfectly healthy.

07:03.959 --> 07:05.126
To make sure
she walks out of here

07:05.160 --> 07:06.561
feeling better
than when she walked in.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.596
And more important,
that she doesn't come back

07:08.630 --> 07:10.632
to the ER tomorrow.

07:15.671 --> 07:17.338
Lily's family's filing a suit.

07:17.372 --> 07:19.007
What family?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.776
I never saw them once
the entire time she was here.

07:20.809 --> 07:22.811
Me neither,
but risk management's launching

07:22.844 --> 07:24.646
an investigation,
so they're definitely suing.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.815
I was her internist.

07:26.848 --> 07:28.249
Why haven't I heard about it?

07:28.283 --> 07:30.285
Probably because
they're focusing on me.

07:30.318 --> 07:32.788
This is what they do, find
a lower-level hospital worker

07:32.821 --> 07:34.355
to pin everything on.

07:36.191 --> 07:37.893
Hey.

07:41.997 --> 07:44.766
As soon as the autopsy results
come back,

07:44.800 --> 07:48.136
they'll see that a chemo
overdose caused Lily's death,

07:48.169 --> 07:49.971
and you had
nothing to do with that.

07:51.973 --> 07:53.541
Come here, come here, come here.

08:09.190 --> 08:11.192
Is this a formal investigation?

08:11.226 --> 08:13.294
I'm trying to get
to the truth of what happened

08:13.328 --> 08:15.463
with the fire in Dr. Bell's OR.

08:15.496 --> 08:18.800
This is the surveillance footage
from the security camera.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.635
That scalpel there,
it has a spark.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.903
That's a big deal.

08:21.937 --> 08:23.304
It's a cautery tool.

08:23.338 --> 08:24.706
They all spark.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.242
Yes, but the spark hit
the surgical drape.

08:27.275 --> 08:28.343
He should have been
more careful.

08:28.376 --> 08:29.644
No, it's not that simple.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.246
He's holding the tool
that caused the fire.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.916
Do you see the pure oxygen
pooling from the patient's neck?

08:34.950 --> 08:37.318
No, of course not.
Oxygen is invisible.

08:37.352 --> 08:39.020
Exactly. Neither did Bell.

08:39.054 --> 08:42.423
It's seeping out
from under the patient's mask.

08:42.457 --> 08:44.559
And since pure oxygen
is heavier than air,

08:44.592 --> 08:46.661
it falls to the table
and collects like kindling

08:46.694 --> 08:48.429
waiting to ignite.

08:50.098 --> 08:53.201
The spark hits it and bam...
fire.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.537
It was an accident.

08:56.571 --> 08:58.673
It sounds like
you're covering up for him.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.508
I'm telling you
what caused the fire.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.378
And it wasn't Dr. Bell.

09:03.411 --> 09:05.680
A surgical fire?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.248
I'm calling in a favor

09:07.282 --> 09:09.117
with the best plastic surgeon
I know, Dr. Rand.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.052
We'll go over our options.

09:11.086 --> 09:12.287
I think I'm cursed.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.222
You aren't cursed.

09:14.255 --> 09:18.059
Fires in the OR are rare,
but they do happen.

09:18.093 --> 09:22.630
In high school,
they called me "Tumor Boy"

09:22.663 --> 09:26.935
because of this huge mass
coming off of my neck.

09:26.968 --> 09:29.971
But surgery was so expensive,
my family couldn't afford it.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.542
So when I was old enough,
I went to work coding,

09:34.575 --> 09:36.611
like a rat in a cubicle.

09:38.479 --> 09:40.481
I saved every penny.

09:40.515 --> 09:42.283
And all I wanted to do
was to look normal.

09:42.317 --> 09:44.786
And-and I wake up...

09:44.820 --> 09:47.655
looking like Freddy Krueger.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.291
We'll do everything possible
to make this better.

09:50.325 --> 09:52.327
I promise.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.995
When Lily came to the hospital

09:54.029 --> 09:56.131
after her final chemo dose,
she was so sick.

09:56.164 --> 09:59.100
Nauseous, vomiting, dehydrated.

10:01.136 --> 10:02.637
And she was scared.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.738
Scared?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.573
Why was she scared?

10:05.606 --> 10:08.609
Earlier that morning, she'd
undergone a massive chemo blast.

10:08.643 --> 10:11.813
It was causing her body to fail,
and she knew it.

10:11.847 --> 10:14.983
Dr. Hunter has
her own powerful protocols

10:15.016 --> 10:17.018
which have had remarkable
success fighting cancer.

10:17.052 --> 10:19.687
And take a toll on patients
in every possible way.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.857
Lily was depressed,

10:21.890 --> 10:25.994
and weak, and that was before
Dr. Hunter bombarded her system.

10:26.027 --> 10:28.263
She wasn't strong enough
for such high doses.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.832
Are you suggesting
that Dr. Hunter was to blame

10:30.866 --> 10:32.868
for Lily's death?

10:35.336 --> 10:38.206
I wish Dr. Hunter hadn't given
her that last treatment.

10:38.239 --> 10:40.708
Lily wanted to stop.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.011
She told me herself.

10:44.679 --> 10:48.316
Dr. Hunter convinced her
to go through with it,

10:48.349 --> 10:50.651
and Lily paid
the ultimate price.

10:50.685 --> 10:52.187
Nurse Nevin,

10:52.220 --> 10:56.157
Lily Kendall didn't die
from a chemo blast.

10:58.559 --> 11:01.396
The autopsy results are back.
They identify

11:01.429 --> 11:04.765
Lily's cause of death
as a potassium overdose.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.570
That's not possible.

11:09.604 --> 11:11.239
The bag of potassium
that you hung for Lily

11:11.272 --> 11:14.375
the night she died...
killed her.

11:21.082 --> 11:24.185
After Dr. Rand
has worked his magic,

11:24.219 --> 11:26.888
the scarring will be minimal.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.194
- Yeah.
- No more Freddy Kreuger for you.

11:33.228 --> 11:36.664
It's amazing what a great
plastic surgeon can do.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.667
How long until I look
almost normal?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.102
Several months
to be ready for surgery

11:41.136 --> 11:42.403
and then heal afterwards.

11:42.437 --> 11:44.906
- Man.
- Oh, come on.

11:44.940 --> 11:47.775
I've already waited so long
to be camera ready, dude.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.345
Camera ready?

11:50.378 --> 11:53.915
I didn't want to do the surgery
just to look better.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.583
I was gonna quit coding.
I was gonna do my own thing.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.052
A NetTube channel.

11:57.085 --> 11:59.387
"ChioffiCoffee
with TJ and Rascal."

11:59.420 --> 12:03.291
Rascal is... my dog.

12:05.326 --> 12:07.295
Yeah, he's a badass.

12:07.328 --> 12:09.230
Oh, dude, he's a total badass.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.566
We'll do a bunch of cool stuff
together, you know?

12:11.599 --> 12:13.068
Like, shred a skateboard.

12:13.101 --> 12:16.037
- I've been training him to box.
- But why wait?

12:16.071 --> 12:19.274
Vlog the whole process of
plastic surgery and recovery.

12:19.307 --> 12:21.776
Just be yourself.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.212
People love you.
You're funny as hell.

12:24.245 --> 12:26.547
Would you subscribe to that?

12:26.581 --> 12:29.584
Are you kidding me? Absolutely.

12:29.617 --> 12:31.652
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

12:31.686 --> 12:33.554
Uh, you have a second?

12:33.588 --> 12:35.823
A potassium overdose?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.725
Lane told me to set the drip
to the slowest setting,

12:37.758 --> 12:39.327
infusing her over eight hours.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.162
Somehow, she got the entire dose
in 30 minutes.

12:41.196 --> 12:44.499
Was there something wrong
with the bag?

12:44.532 --> 12:47.768
What I do know is
that when I set the flow rate,

12:47.802 --> 12:49.337
I checked it and I rechecked it.

12:49.370 --> 12:52.773
You know how thorough I am.
I didn't make a mistake.

12:52.807 --> 12:54.009
And now Lily's family is suing,

12:54.042 --> 12:55.743
so they need a scapegoat,
and I'm it.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.746
- I'll fix this.
- No, stop.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.015
I don't need you
doing anything crazy.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.282
It's only gonna
make things worse.

13:01.316 --> 13:03.784
What do you want me to do?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.823
Help me find proof.

13:12.027 --> 13:14.162
Where do we start?

13:14.195 --> 13:16.864
Okay, there are seven of Lane's
patients here at Chastain.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.366
Run a full blood panel on each.

13:18.399 --> 13:20.501
Okay, seven patients?
What are we looking for?

13:20.535 --> 13:23.504
Anything that shows a pattern
of Lane making mistakes.

13:23.538 --> 13:25.540
Kidney function,
potassium levels.

13:25.573 --> 13:26.941
Okay, but there's a problem.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.143
When the test results come in

13:28.176 --> 13:30.178
on Lane's patients,
they go directly to her.

13:30.211 --> 13:31.912
He's right.

13:33.214 --> 13:36.517
But since I am
in the ER today...

13:38.486 --> 13:42.223
I could run the blood work here
like they're for our John Does.

13:43.424 --> 13:44.992
That works. You're catching on.

13:45.026 --> 13:48.563
One thing. We can't drag
another nurse into this.

13:48.596 --> 13:50.031
They could get
into serious trouble,

13:50.065 --> 13:51.866
so perform the blood draws
yourself.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.235
Okay, okay. Refresh my memory
as to how to draw blood

13:54.269 --> 13:55.970
and we're good to go.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.972
Don't look at me. I haven't
drawn blood since med school.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.675
Doctors.

14:02.877 --> 14:07.715
Dr. Kays. I'm reviewing every
surgeon's complication rate.

14:07.748 --> 14:10.651
Well, my stats are
no cause for concern.

14:10.685 --> 14:12.220
Agreed, but the same
cannot be said

14:12.253 --> 14:14.722
of your surgical resident, Dr. Okafor.

14:14.755 --> 14:17.525
She's seen more
than her fair share.

14:17.558 --> 14:19.827
Not in my OR.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.429
Ladies.

14:21.462 --> 14:25.333
What brings you to our
floor again today, Claire?

14:25.366 --> 14:28.236
Well, she's worried about
Dr. Okafor's complication rate.

14:28.269 --> 14:31.005
Those concerns were previously
brought to the surgical board

14:31.038 --> 14:32.673
and put to rest.

14:32.707 --> 14:35.610
I'm just interested
in Dr. Kaye's assessment.

14:35.643 --> 14:36.744
Uh, well, initially,
I had doubts,

14:36.777 --> 14:38.679
because Mina is arrogant.

14:38.713 --> 14:42.117
Turns out she has a right
to be, because she's brilliant

14:42.150 --> 14:44.585
and careful and fearless,

14:44.619 --> 14:46.721
and I wish I had
ten more like her.

14:46.754 --> 14:48.356
What're your thoughts?

14:48.389 --> 14:50.925
No, I agree. As I've said
before, I think she's a talent.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.894
High praise, all around.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.970
Yeah, that's-that's
the worst the pain's ever been.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.140
It's got to be
another obstruction.

15:05.173 --> 15:06.541
No air-fluid levels,

15:06.574 --> 15:08.776
no dilated loops of bowel.
X-ray's normal.

15:08.809 --> 15:10.044
Then why does it hurt so bad?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.046
- Well, it can be either two things...
- Dr. Feldman.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.316
Multi-casualty MVC just arrived
and bed eight needs you.

15:15.350 --> 15:17.885
I'll give you one shot
of Dilaudid for the pain.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.954
Nurse Hundley will walk you
through dietary recommendations

15:19.987 --> 15:21.956
- and we'll send you on your way.
- Up to surgery.

15:23.324 --> 15:24.992
For a perforated intestine.

15:26.627 --> 15:30.097
Sir, this is free air
under your diaphragm.

15:30.131 --> 15:31.666
Surgery? It's serious?

15:31.699 --> 15:33.734
Dr. Feldman, am I,
am I gonna be okay?

15:33.768 --> 15:35.936
We caught this early.
We'll start antibiotics

15:35.970 --> 15:37.405
and you'll have it fixed
this afternoon

15:37.438 --> 15:38.839
and be recovered in no time.
Hey.

15:38.873 --> 15:41.242
Hang in there.

15:41.276 --> 15:43.678
Good catch.

15:43.711 --> 15:46.514
Call a gen surg consult
then jump into the trauma.

15:46.547 --> 15:48.616
Good looking out.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.918
Lesson two, no matter what
other emergency pops up...

15:50.951 --> 15:54.255
Don't let you kill the patient.
Got it.

15:54.289 --> 15:56.524
You do catch on quick.

16:01.996 --> 16:03.398
May I join you?

16:07.402 --> 16:10.338
So, Claire has been...

16:10.371 --> 16:12.307
asking about your error rates.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.108
And, of course, I had your back.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.512
Oh, like when you blamed me

16:17.545 --> 16:19.113
for the complication
that happened

16:19.146 --> 16:20.981
during your multiple surgeries?

16:21.015 --> 16:23.318
Just tell me what you want.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.323
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if Claire or someone from HR

16:28.356 --> 16:30.991
reaches out to you
about the fire.

16:31.025 --> 16:33.994
She already found me.

16:34.028 --> 16:36.697
And what'd you tell her?

16:36.731 --> 16:39.934
The truth.

16:45.573 --> 16:49.477
Yes, Nurse Nevin was in charge
of Lily's care that night,

16:49.510 --> 16:53.514
but I can't fathom how
a respected nurse practitioner

16:53.548 --> 16:56.217
could make such
a careless error.

16:56.251 --> 16:58.586
What error, exactly?

16:58.619 --> 17:01.756
Well, obviously,
when the bag was hung,

17:01.789 --> 17:04.157
the wrong flow rate was set.

17:04.191 --> 17:07.595
You're saying that Nurse Nevin
set the flow rate incorrectly?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.029
Well...

17:09.063 --> 17:10.931
it is possible.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.199
But I'm also...

17:12.233 --> 17:15.935
W-Wait.
What other explanation is there?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.940
At the moment, there isn't one.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.446
What happened?

17:28.282 --> 17:30.451
He was fine.
His O2 levels went down.

17:30.485 --> 17:32.253
- He started suffocating.
- Help me.

17:32.287 --> 17:33.288
Help.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.424
Here we go.
I can barely bag him.

17:36.457 --> 17:39.927
The swelling from the burns
is compressing his trachea.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.429
All right, his sats
are down to 78%.

17:41.462 --> 17:43.464
- He's bradying down.
- Start prepping the neck.

17:43.498 --> 17:44.465
Gonna need to do an escharotomy.

17:44.499 --> 17:46.267
He's gonna code, doctor.

17:46.301 --> 17:48.736
Hang on, TJ. Hang on.

17:48.769 --> 17:51.406
We need anesthetic?

17:51.439 --> 17:53.774
Burned flesh has no sensation.
He won't feel anything.

17:53.808 --> 17:55.510
We do need to worry
about infection.

18:03.618 --> 18:05.320
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

18:05.353 --> 18:08.456
Come on, come on, come on...

18:14.194 --> 18:15.730
His sats are going up.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.570
Slow, deep breaths.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.272
Deep breaths, TJ.

18:37.017 --> 18:39.987
Do you really think they're
gonna blame Lily's death on you?

18:40.020 --> 18:42.256
Not without a fight.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.358
Let's get this over with.

18:43.391 --> 18:46.026
All right.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.763
Needle bevel up, 30 degrees.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.130
Ready?

18:50.164 --> 18:52.667
Yep.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.436
- Ow.
- Sorry.

18:55.470 --> 18:58.806
Okay, um, you're angling it
a little too high.

18:58.839 --> 19:00.541
Try again. Down a little bit.

19:00.575 --> 19:01.876
Lower. Yeah.

19:01.909 --> 19:04.111
Start.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.113
- No.
- Sorry.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.848
Pull the skin down taut
like this.

19:07.882 --> 19:11.819
One more time.

19:11.852 --> 19:13.621
Wow, okay. Um...

19:13.654 --> 19:16.791
I will be drawing the blood.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.059
You're not supposed
to go near the patients.

19:19.093 --> 19:21.195
I am done coloring
inside the lines

19:21.228 --> 19:22.930
in a system rigged against me.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.505
Come on.

19:30.538 --> 19:32.306
Are you kidding me?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.541
I already gave blood
this morning.

19:33.574 --> 19:36.243
It's frozen, Mr. Guzman.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.647
Damn it.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.316
It's not fair.
You know my weakness.

19:42.349 --> 19:46.320
I'd let you have a gallon
of my blood for one of these.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.855
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.407
Next victim.

20:07.908 --> 20:09.444
Ah, I got to take this.

20:09.477 --> 20:11.446
Wait for me so I can
stand guard with you.

20:11.479 --> 20:13.213
- I got it.
- Nic.

20:13.247 --> 20:15.115
I'm good.

20:17.051 --> 20:18.586
You paged?

20:18.619 --> 20:21.021
Where you been?

20:21.055 --> 20:23.123
Conrad needed help
with something.

20:23.157 --> 20:25.626
Oh, yeah. No, you don't get
to run off during your ER shift

20:25.660 --> 20:27.061
to help Conrad.

20:27.094 --> 20:28.596
We're not busy right now.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.798
Don't jinx us. Here.

20:30.831 --> 20:34.234
Nothing I've tried has worked
and I hate snot.

20:34.268 --> 20:35.770
Luca, bed one.

20:35.803 --> 20:38.238
Let's see what you come up with.

20:40.608 --> 20:42.042
Hi, Luca.

20:42.076 --> 20:43.911
- -Oh, hey.
- What's happening?

20:43.944 --> 20:47.448
Uh, she shoved her father's blue
collectable marble up her nose,

20:47.482 --> 20:49.750
like way up her nose.

20:49.784 --> 20:50.985
We're gonna get it out, okay?

20:51.018 --> 20:52.953
It's okay.

20:52.987 --> 20:55.790
Shh. It's okay.

21:17.044 --> 21:19.013
You're supposed
to be on desk duty.

21:19.046 --> 21:21.148
I know.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.023
Hold on.

21:30.625 --> 21:33.293
Mr. Smith in 5087.

21:33.327 --> 21:34.695
I can't find his vein.

21:34.729 --> 21:36.430
Can you stick him for me?

21:38.232 --> 21:40.467
Sure, no problem.

21:43.871 --> 21:45.205
You'll be great.

21:45.239 --> 21:46.373
Thanks, Doc.

21:47.508 --> 21:48.843
I used a cardiac catheter

21:48.876 --> 21:51.111
to pull the marble
out of her sinus cavity.

21:51.145 --> 21:53.147
Worked like a dream.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.382
You're good, Dr. Pravesh.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.451
Did Conrad tell you to use
the catheter like that?

21:57.484 --> 21:59.720
No, I did it on my own.

21:59.754 --> 22:02.690
Not bad for a Harvard grad. Huh?

22:12.700 --> 22:15.069
Hey, Ashley.
When's my interview?

22:15.102 --> 22:17.838
Your interview's been cancelled,
Dr. Hawkins.

22:17.872 --> 22:19.473
Why?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.508
I just keep the schedule.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.853
Dr. Hawkins.

22:34.021 --> 22:36.256
What's going on, Alexis?

22:36.290 --> 22:37.491
Why was my interview cancelled?

22:37.524 --> 22:38.993
Lily was my patient,

22:39.026 --> 22:41.428
and I was the last person
to see her alive.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.363
Why won't they let me testify?

22:43.397 --> 22:44.999
Dr. Hunter.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.067
She convinced them
that you can't be objective

22:47.101 --> 22:49.069
because you're in a romantic
relationship with Nic.

22:49.103 --> 22:52.607
Conrad, Lane totally threw her
under the bus.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.575
And they believed her.

22:54.609 --> 22:56.844
Now, everyone's afraid
if they stand up for Nic,

22:56.877 --> 22:58.278
they'll get fired.

22:58.312 --> 23:00.214
All right.

23:00.247 --> 23:01.716
Thank you, Alexis.

23:01.749 --> 23:03.818
I promise I didn't hear this
from you.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.593
- Dr. Hawkins, what are you doing here?
- Your best nurse

23:12.627 --> 23:14.595
is getting screwed over.
That's not a risk management

23:14.629 --> 23:16.463
investigation,
it's a witch hunt.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.132
- Okay, Conrad. That's enough.
- Do you know why Lane

23:18.165 --> 23:20.635
barred Nic from treating Lily
those last few weeks?

23:20.668 --> 23:22.536
'Cause Nurse Nevin
was making some mistakes.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.238
No, she doesn't make mistakes.

23:24.271 --> 23:26.140
She catches them.

23:26.173 --> 23:28.542
That's why she was the first one
to see what Lane has been doing.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.478
What do you think Lane
has been doing?

23:31.511 --> 23:34.481
Overdosing patients with chemo,
discharging patients too soon,

23:34.514 --> 23:35.816
- hiding patients' records...
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

23:35.850 --> 23:37.284
You want me to believe
this about one

23:37.317 --> 23:39.654
of our most respected doctors
at Chastain?

23:39.687 --> 23:43.557
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm asking you to believe.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.560
And I can't stop thinking if I
would've listened to Nic sooner,

23:46.593 --> 23:48.595
maybe Lily would still be alive.

23:48.629 --> 23:51.331
Lane's protocols
did not kill Lily.

23:51.365 --> 23:52.967
A potassium overdose did.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.136
And Lane is trying
to pin that overdose on Nic.

23:56.170 --> 23:59.807
Dr. Hunter put Nic back on
Lily's case the day Lily died.

23:59.840 --> 24:04.011
Come on. Clearly, something
is going on here, Ms. Thorpe.

24:04.044 --> 24:06.180
Lane is up to something,
and if we don't do anything...

24:06.213 --> 24:09.583
Okay, Lane is devastated
about Lily's death.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.985
And I am not sure
what you're insinuating,

24:11.018 --> 24:12.586
but she was nowhere
near Chastain

24:12.619 --> 24:14.488
the night that Lily died.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.991
Lane was out to dinner
with Dr. Bell.

24:17.024 --> 24:19.493
Perfect. The Hands of Death
and Destruction is her alibi?

24:19.526 --> 24:22.830
Keep your absurd
allegations to yourself.

24:22.863 --> 24:25.499
If you don't open your eyes
to the truth, hold on tight,

24:25.532 --> 24:26.801
because this entire hospital

24:26.834 --> 24:29.503
will come crashing down
on all of us.

24:34.074 --> 24:37.177
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to ChioffiCoffee.

24:37.211 --> 24:39.113
Have you ever felt
like you might be cursed?

24:39.146 --> 24:41.816
Well, wait till you see my day.

25:08.909 --> 25:10.677
Where'd he get the video?

25:10.711 --> 25:13.647
It's a mystery, isn't it?

25:21.388 --> 25:23.223
Uh, how many hits does it have?

25:23.257 --> 25:26.927
Mm, 560,000 and climbing.

25:26.961 --> 25:29.229
Wow.

25:35.302 --> 25:37.571
Wow. I just saw the video.
We need to get ahead of this.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.173
Can we get it off the Web?

25:39.206 --> 25:40.941
No, it's already gone viral.
No one can stop it.

25:40.975 --> 25:42.542
Not even my contacts at NetTube.

25:42.576 --> 25:44.511
Trust me, I've already tried.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.113
Okay, so what do you recommend?

25:46.146 --> 25:47.748
We need to give them
something else, something good.

25:47.782 --> 25:49.116
A human interest story,

25:49.149 --> 25:53.453
maybe a kid from a...
war-torn country.

25:53.487 --> 25:55.756
Build him a face, or hands,

25:55.790 --> 25:57.624
- a limb. Something.
- All right.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.127
- You find the kid, I'll find the money.
- Okay.

26:07.001 --> 26:08.068
Congrats.

26:08.102 --> 26:09.269
Yeah?

26:09.303 --> 26:10.437
You're a star.

26:10.470 --> 26:11.772
And you are a genius.

26:11.806 --> 26:13.573
No, I had nothing to do
with you hacking

26:13.607 --> 26:15.709
into the surgical
learning database.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.044
The hell you didn't.

26:17.077 --> 26:19.246
Chastain could use
a security update.

26:19.279 --> 26:20.881
And I could help you with that,

26:20.915 --> 26:23.717
but I'm... I'm gonna be too busy

26:23.750 --> 26:26.086
finally living my dream.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.488
Thanks, man.
You changed my life.

26:28.522 --> 26:31.091
No more coding in a cubicle
for this guy.

26:32.659 --> 26:35.329
Can't wait to watch
your NetTube channel.

26:41.802 --> 26:43.403
Hey. I...

26:43.437 --> 26:46.273
I thought Dr. Kays was doing
this hernia repair.

26:46.306 --> 26:48.675
She is, I'm just...

26:48.708 --> 26:52.312
I'm just here to see how you're
holding up after this morning.

26:52.346 --> 26:54.314
Claire's making the rounds.

26:54.348 --> 26:56.650
I haven't talked to anyone.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.618
I mean, OR fires are caused
by the anesthesia team.

26:58.652 --> 27:00.087
And I think,
before an inaccurate narrative

27:00.120 --> 27:01.121
takes a hold, well,

27:01.155 --> 27:03.657
we got to figure out
what the hell happened.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.126
What do you need from me?

27:10.164 --> 27:11.331
Hey.

27:11.365 --> 27:14.101
Got all the blood work back.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.769
Anything unusual?

27:15.802 --> 27:18.772
All of Lane's patients are
as healthy as can be expected.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.175
Damn it.

27:21.208 --> 27:23.177
Well, at least
the patients are safe.

27:23.210 --> 27:25.012
For now.

27:31.852 --> 27:34.554
I'm being called back in
for more questions.

27:34.588 --> 27:35.722
You want me to come with you?

27:35.755 --> 27:37.157
After your sit-down with Claire,

27:37.191 --> 27:39.626
- you should probably hang back.
- Nic.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.062
Are you sorry I did it?

27:43.397 --> 27:45.399
No.

27:50.704 --> 27:53.507
So we have no record
of the rate at which

27:53.540 --> 27:56.010
Lily received the potassium,

27:56.043 --> 27:58.712
or if you did in fact,
as you claim,

27:58.745 --> 28:01.348
set the flow machine
at the prescribed rate.

28:01.381 --> 28:04.084
If I made an error,
I would admit it, but I didn't.

28:04.118 --> 28:06.053
Then how do you account for
the lethal levels of potassium

28:06.086 --> 28:08.355
in Lily's system?

28:08.388 --> 28:11.691
Someone must have changed
the flow rate after I set it.

28:11.725 --> 28:14.328
So your defense is, is that
some mysterious person came

28:14.361 --> 28:18.198
into Lily's room after you left,
and accelerated the flow rate,

28:18.232 --> 28:20.434
administering a lethal dose
of potassium?

28:20.467 --> 28:23.503
Why would someone do that?

28:25.139 --> 28:27.975
To kill Lily.

28:29.743 --> 28:32.212
Um...

28:32.246 --> 28:34.414
Who would kill a patient who,
by all accounts,

28:34.448 --> 28:36.550
is beloved by the entire staff?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.889
I could guess,
but I don't have any proof,

28:42.923 --> 28:44.358
so I'm not going to do that.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.726
Well, if you have something
to tell us,

28:46.760 --> 28:48.963
it would be in your
best interest to do it now.

28:50.630 --> 28:54.401
My best interest?

28:54.434 --> 28:59.039
None of this is
in my best interest, or Lily's.

28:59.073 --> 29:01.108
We want to know the truth.

29:01.141 --> 29:03.810
- The family wants to know the truth.
- No, you don't.

29:03.843 --> 29:07.614
And Lily's family wasn't here
taking care of her.

29:07.647 --> 29:11.451
Not once over the two years
that she was in and out.

29:11.485 --> 29:14.488
I comforted her.

29:14.521 --> 29:16.490
Talked to her about death.

29:16.523 --> 29:18.458
Bathed her, fed her.

29:18.492 --> 29:21.128
I cared for her.

29:21.161 --> 29:24.898
Not because I liked her,

29:24.931 --> 29:26.967
which I did,

29:27.001 --> 29:30.604
and not because she was
one of my favorite patients,

29:30.637 --> 29:33.807
which she was.

29:35.642 --> 29:38.512
I cared for Lily the same way
I care for all of my patients.

29:38.545 --> 29:41.081
'Cause that is what nurses do.

29:41.115 --> 29:43.350
Now, doctors order tests,
they prescribe meds,

29:43.383 --> 29:46.620
and they go home, but nurses...

29:49.389 --> 29:51.358
You know, doctors think
the patients are theirs,

29:51.391 --> 29:52.559
but they're not.

29:55.362 --> 29:57.697
They're ours.

29:57.731 --> 30:00.167
The nurses'.

30:00.200 --> 30:04.004
Lily Kendall was my patient,

30:04.038 --> 30:07.741
and I did not harm her.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.811
But someone else did.

30:17.417 --> 30:19.419
I think we're done here.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.392
Yeah.

30:31.698 --> 30:33.533
Ha-ha, Roman.
Glad you're feeling better, man.

30:33.567 --> 30:34.734
Okay.

30:34.768 --> 30:38.038
You're on a roll.

30:38.072 --> 30:39.973
But this next one's tricky.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.741
Try Mr. Langdon out for size.

30:41.775 --> 30:43.043
Bay two.

30:43.077 --> 30:44.178
On his first day?

30:44.211 --> 30:45.312
That's not fair.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.513
Oh, whatever it is, I got it.

30:48.748 --> 30:51.017
- Double or nothing?
- You're on.

30:51.051 --> 30:53.153
Hello, Mr. Langdon.

30:53.187 --> 30:54.821
What seems to be the problem?

30:54.854 --> 30:56.423
Snakes.

30:56.456 --> 30:58.858
I got snakes in my throat.

30:58.892 --> 31:00.694
They're crawling, like,
all down here.

31:00.727 --> 31:02.196
I can feel it moving,
like, right now.

31:02.229 --> 31:03.397
Well, let's take a look at them.

31:03.430 --> 31:05.499
W-Will it hurt?

31:05.532 --> 31:06.900
Not a bit.

31:08.902 --> 31:11.205
Okay, Mr. Langdon.

31:11.238 --> 31:12.839
Open wide and say "ah."

31:12.872 --> 31:15.041
Ah...

31:22.216 --> 31:24.451
Nurse Hundley.

31:24.484 --> 31:26.052
Let's get ready for the...

31:26.086 --> 31:27.621
the...

31:27.654 --> 31:29.389
the snake extraction.

31:29.423 --> 31:31.458
- Okay.
- All right?

31:31.491 --> 31:32.926
Magill forceps.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.363
- Y-You almost got it?
- Shh...

31:36.396 --> 31:38.232
We don't want
to scare her. -Uh-huh.

31:38.265 --> 31:42.402
Almost... there.

31:42.436 --> 31:43.870
Oh, yeah.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.039
Here we go.

31:46.072 --> 31:49.609
One female, beige snake.

31:49.643 --> 31:52.112
- Uh, hard to believe that was
in my throat, huh? -It is.

31:52.146 --> 31:53.980
Specimen jar!

32:00.487 --> 32:02.789
How you doing, Mr. Langdon?

32:02.822 --> 32:04.324
So much better.

32:05.492 --> 32:06.493
Oh.

32:06.526 --> 32:08.595
Thank you, Doctor.

32:10.830 --> 32:13.167
Oh, you are very welcome.

32:17.337 --> 32:19.072
Okay.

32:19.105 --> 32:23.410
While I was giving my testimony,
I suddenly realized...

32:23.443 --> 32:25.912
Lane did this intentionally.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.782
She overdosed Lily
intentionally?

32:28.815 --> 32:30.083
- Did you say that to them?
- No.

32:30.116 --> 32:33.687
But I know it's true.
Who else had the motive?

32:33.720 --> 32:35.755
I mean, think about it.
Dr. Osder probably called her

32:35.789 --> 32:37.957
that afternoon for Lily's files.

32:37.991 --> 32:39.993
There must be something
in Lily's files

32:40.026 --> 32:41.328
that Lane didn't want
anyone to see,

32:41.361 --> 32:42.862
so she made sure that
Osder couldn't get it.

32:42.896 --> 32:45.098
Didn't she tell you
she was leaving for the night?

32:45.131 --> 32:47.301
She made a point of telling me

32:47.334 --> 32:49.536
that she was leaving
when she ordered the potassium.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.473
I think she pretended to leave

32:53.507 --> 32:55.475
and then doubled back
to adjust the flow rate.

32:57.244 --> 32:58.945
Then it's completely
untraceable,

32:58.978 --> 33:01.515
and it looks like you set it
wrong from the beginning.

33:04.184 --> 33:06.320
But you believe me, right?

33:06.353 --> 33:09.656
Of course I believe you.

33:21.034 --> 33:23.470
Dr. Okafor, have you ever heard

33:23.503 --> 33:25.739
Dr. Hawkins call Dr. Bell

33:25.772 --> 33:29.543
the "Hands of Death
and Destruction," or HODAD?

33:29.576 --> 33:32.011
Yes. I have.

33:32.045 --> 33:34.314
Why? I need to know.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.316
You are asking me to be
a whistle-blower.

33:36.350 --> 33:39.219
I need someone to
tell me what's going on.

33:39.253 --> 33:41.821
Whistle-blowers get fired.
Not just at Chastain.

33:41.855 --> 33:43.257
At the best hospitals
in the country,

33:43.290 --> 33:44.558
it happens again and again.

33:44.591 --> 33:47.527
I love surgery
more than anything.

33:47.561 --> 33:50.430
I have given up everything
to be here in America,

33:50.464 --> 33:53.600
practicing, and I want to stay.

33:53.633 --> 33:56.035
I will do everything I can
to protect you.

33:56.069 --> 33:59.239
If you go after Bell,
you are at risk as well.

33:59.273 --> 34:02.041
He'll stop at nothing
to destroy you.

34:02.075 --> 34:04.578
I am the CEO.

34:04.611 --> 34:07.347
His future is in my hands,
not the other way around.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.850
And this is not only about Bell.

34:10.884 --> 34:14.219
It's about saving
patients' lives.

34:14.254 --> 34:17.591
You are a great doctor.

34:17.623 --> 34:21.360
And if great doctors
don't speak up...

34:21.395 --> 34:23.830
nothing changes.

34:31.938 --> 34:35.609
I'll tell you the truth,
but only within these walls.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.476
If you reference
this conversation,

34:37.511 --> 34:38.745
I'll deny it ever happened.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.547
Understood.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.081
You have my word.

34:44.484 --> 34:45.918
Let's start at the beginning,

34:45.952 --> 34:49.088
when he killed a patient
during an appendectomy.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.458
- Well done. -Hey, next video,
you got to be in it.

34:53.860 --> 34:56.330
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great, actually.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.231
NetTube just offered him
a partnership.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.800
Looks like his curse is broken.

35:00.834 --> 35:04.003
The board called an emergency
meeting to discuss Bell.

35:04.037 --> 35:07.273
That fire he didn't even start
might end his career.

35:07.307 --> 35:08.808
Isn't there a word for that?

35:08.842 --> 35:11.244
Irony?

35:11.277 --> 35:14.314
I was going for justice,
but yours works, too.

35:14.348 --> 35:17.684
The fire today is only the last
in a string of errors

35:17.717 --> 35:19.252
caused by Dr. Bell.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.621
Most of which have been
so cleverly covered up,

35:21.655 --> 35:24.691
I have no evidence to present.

35:24.724 --> 35:27.293
You're making very
serious accusations.

35:27.327 --> 35:29.496
And they're all hearsay?

35:29.529 --> 35:31.865
The staff that have come forward
wish to remain anonymous

35:31.898 --> 35:33.166
for fear of reprisal.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.502
Disgruntled staff?
That's your evidence.

35:35.535 --> 35:37.637
Autopsies are rarely
performed these days,

35:37.671 --> 35:39.939
so there is nothing to prevent
surgeons from disguising errors

35:39.973 --> 35:42.476
by listing "complications"
as the cause of death.

35:42.509 --> 35:45.044
The truth remains in the OR,

35:45.078 --> 35:48.314
unless somebody insists
on transparency, and I do.

35:48.348 --> 35:50.216
Which is why I installed

35:50.249 --> 35:52.318
recording devices
in all the ORs.

35:54.488 --> 35:56.155
And this is what we see.

36:01.060 --> 36:02.295
Get that O2 mask off.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.364
Rip the drapes down.

36:04.398 --> 36:07.200
More oxygen might be
hiding beneath them.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.877
This video is damning, Randolph.

36:17.911 --> 36:20.079
Well, it's not,
when you understand

36:20.113 --> 36:21.347
what you're looking at.

36:26.019 --> 36:28.422
See this machine right here?

36:30.023 --> 36:33.560
Sitting beside it is Dr. Paul Chu,

36:33.593 --> 36:35.429
chief anesthesiologist
here at Chastain.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.764
Dr. Chu?

36:40.266 --> 36:43.236
Dr. Chu, can you explain
the cause of this fire?

36:45.204 --> 36:47.073
Every year in the U.S.,

36:47.106 --> 36:50.076
there are around 600 OR fires,

36:50.109 --> 36:51.344
just like the one
we had here today.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.613
They are preventable

36:53.647 --> 36:55.515
if you replace
antiquated machines

36:55.549 --> 36:57.417
like the ones we have with...

36:57.451 --> 37:00.620
With the newer air-oxygen
blending machines

37:00.654 --> 37:03.857
that allow a skilled
anesthesiologist like Dr. Chu

37:03.890 --> 37:06.693
to limit the flow
of pure oxygen.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.195
A request I made to Claire

37:09.228 --> 37:11.931
right after she began here at Chastain.

37:11.965 --> 37:15.368
His proposal
was cost-prohibitive.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.437
So you chose saving money

37:17.471 --> 37:19.873
over patient safety.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.544
So this was made...

37:24.578 --> 37:26.245
with Claire's OR camera.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.797
As you can see, it's gone viral.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.099
So, in her zeal
for transparency,

37:46.132 --> 37:50.236
she ignored my warnings
about the damage

37:50.269 --> 37:53.573
this kind of footage can do
in the wrong hands.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.675
What we're witnessing

37:55.709 --> 37:58.812
is when hospital leadership
has an MBA

37:58.845 --> 38:01.848
and doesn't understand medicine.

38:01.881 --> 38:05.284
Our CEO needs to be a doctor.

38:12.992 --> 38:14.661
Claire wanted to see me?

38:14.694 --> 38:18.464
Uh, the board meeting's running
late, have a seat outside.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.369
Hello?

38:37.083 --> 38:38.552
Hey, you have a minute?

38:38.585 --> 38:40.954
Oh, you know better than that.

38:40.987 --> 38:44.357
- You have to hustle back
to the clinic? -Yeah.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.726
I should've listened to my
father, gone into dentistry.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.394
In at 8:00, home by 5:00.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.564
Yeah, nothing against dentists,
but you're saving lives.

38:50.597 --> 38:53.066
Well, I'm not alone
in the fight, but thank you.

38:53.099 --> 38:55.301
Really? 'Cause I can't find
another oncologist

38:55.334 --> 38:57.370
who carpet-bombs patients
with chemo in secret,

38:57.403 --> 38:59.405
unsupervised cancer clinics.

39:03.610 --> 39:05.712
Only one patient,
she got scared,

39:05.745 --> 39:07.413
thought she was gonna die
in treatment,

39:07.446 --> 39:09.148
looked for
a second opinion, and...

39:09.182 --> 39:13.086
well, you couldn't have that.

39:13.119 --> 39:17.056
Wow. That nurse, Nic.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.525
Clearly, you two
are sleeping together.

39:19.559 --> 39:22.061
Oh, well, you couldn't have me
testifying on her behalf.

39:22.095 --> 39:24.731
If the committee believed me,
you'd lose your scapegoat.

39:24.764 --> 39:27.567
She must be amazing,
for you to take me on.

39:27.601 --> 39:31.004
The doctor who turned
a PTSD army medic

39:31.037 --> 39:33.506
into a competent diagnostician.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.576
I graduated med school at 22.

39:36.610 --> 39:38.077
I was a fellow
at Sloan Kettering

39:38.111 --> 39:39.879
when you were still cutting
into frogs.

39:39.913 --> 39:43.282
I was an attending physician at
Johns Hopkins by the age of 30.

39:43.316 --> 39:45.551
I have three clinics
with my name on them.

39:45.585 --> 39:48.855
And just recently, Emerson
asked me to head oncology,

39:48.888 --> 39:51.725
which I politely declined,
because I'm kind of busy.

39:51.758 --> 39:53.526
Has this been
more than a minute?

39:53.559 --> 39:55.428
I believe it has.

39:55.461 --> 39:59.098
You come at me like that again,
Dr. Hawkins,

39:59.132 --> 40:02.068
and I'll have you selling
orthotics out of your car.

40:02.101 --> 40:06.072
I will end you
without hesitation.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.120
Didn't Dr. Pravesh discharge you

40:21.154 --> 40:23.156
with a prescription
for omeprazole?

40:23.189 --> 40:25.058
- It's an over-the-counter antacid.
- Mm-hmm.

40:25.091 --> 40:28.094
Look, Dr. Feldman,
we've ruled out pleurisy,

40:28.127 --> 40:29.763
IBS, melanoma, shingles

40:29.796 --> 40:31.731
and leprosy, but we still...

40:31.765 --> 40:34.567
we still haven't gotten to the
bottom of my general malaise.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.670
Hypochondria
with a side of depression.

40:36.703 --> 40:38.104
Cancer, okay?

40:38.137 --> 40:40.006
Specifically, lymphoma.

40:40.039 --> 40:42.676
Look, Olivia,
there's absolutely no reason

40:42.709 --> 40:44.243
for you to believe that...

40:44.277 --> 40:46.780
No, I-I don't want to be
the girl that has cancer

40:46.813 --> 40:48.915
that the doctors don't diagnose
until she's stage IV.

40:48.948 --> 40:51.584
I'm not leaving
until I see an oncologist.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.854
Fine. Maybe if one of the most
respected oncologists

40:54.888 --> 40:57.590
this side of the Mississippi
tells you you're cancer-free,

40:57.623 --> 40:59.025
you'll believe her.

41:01.695 --> 41:05.064
Here's a referral
to Dr. Lane Hunter.

41:09.903 --> 41:12.538
Thank you.

41:19.312 --> 41:22.381
The CEO will see you now.

41:37.363 --> 41:39.332
Dr. Bell?

41:43.770 --> 41:45.171
Where's Ms. Thorpe?

41:46.773 --> 41:50.710
I've taken over
the position of CEO.

41:53.179 --> 41:55.348
I see.

41:58.852 --> 42:02.188
You've been with us a long time.

42:02.221 --> 42:04.590
And you're held
in very high esteem

42:04.623 --> 42:06.659
by your colleagues.

42:06.692 --> 42:09.562
That's... why it's difficult

42:09.595 --> 42:11.264
for me to tell you this.

42:37.957 --> 42:39.926
I heard.

42:45.164 --> 42:46.933
Incredible things.

42:54.507 --> 42:57.643
This isn't over yet.
