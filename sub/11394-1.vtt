00:33.825 --> 00:39.946
The chronicles of wushu masters

00:46.755 --> 00:50.668
True legend su can

00:53.720 --> 00:56.928
a yuen woo-ping film

00:59.142 --> 01:02.634
China. 1861.
It is a turbulent time.

01:02.771 --> 01:07.481
While foreign powers threaten
invasion...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.988
As the nation descends into disorder...

01:22.916 --> 01:26.784
The qing dynasty is
on the verge of collapse.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.504
The people remain defiant.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.672
The practice of wushu flourishes.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.512
And from the ashes of chaos...

01:39.641 --> 01:42.474
A new warrior arises.

01:48.609 --> 01:53.854
The decisive battle

02:01.705 --> 02:04.993
Su can, the court's bravest soldier
and his men...

02:05.125 --> 02:08.583
Rescue an imperial prince
who's been kidnapped.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.443
Quick. Follow me!

03:24.579 --> 03:25.910
Kill him!

03:26.039 --> 03:28.826
Kill him! Kill him!

03:53.692 --> 03:56.149
Archers. Cover us!
The rest, follow me.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.484
Kill!

04:16.673 --> 04:18.038
I'll kill you!

04:18.175 --> 04:19.836
Son of a bitch!

04:22.053 --> 04:23.133
I'll kill you!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.300
Son of a bitch!

04:32.105 --> 04:33.811
Your highness. Are you alright?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.646
Su, let's get out of here!

04:35.776 --> 04:37.516
Ma, stay behind.
Yuan, come with me.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.017
Yes, sir!

04:39.154 --> 04:40.394
You bastard!

04:48.997 --> 04:50.783
Son of a bitch!

05:17.108 --> 05:18.894
Bastard!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.563
Son of a bitch!

06:37.731 --> 06:39.062
Mal

07:25.779 --> 07:28.145
Yuan, take the prince to safety.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.986
Sul

07:34.287 --> 07:35.823
go!

07:46.341 --> 07:50.254
Your highness. I'm afraid su is dead.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.425
Dead? Are you sure?

07:54.557 --> 07:58.891
Take an elite team to find general su.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.183
Dead or alive, I want him here!

08:02.315 --> 08:03.725
Yes, sir.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.894
Su is back!

08:06.027 --> 08:08.143
Su is back!

08:08.279 --> 08:11.237
- Soldiers. Take him to the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.780
My dear brother.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.661
Your highness.
Colonel ma and I are back.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.957
Su, you are a great soldier.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.505
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.926
Su, you saved my life.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.224
I'll ask the emperor...

08:40.812 --> 08:43.303
To make you governor of hubei.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.434
I am grateful for your consideration.
But I cannot claim all the credit.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.232
Yuan was also there.

08:51.781 --> 08:56.741
I know yuan is your foster brother...

08:56.870 --> 08:59.452
And the blood brother of your wife.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.118
But he 1s too reckless

09:02.250 --> 09:04.411
you need to control yuan.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.546
If you're afraid of hurting his feelings...

09:09.674 --> 09:11.210
I will send yuan to sichuan.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.625
I hope you'll accept.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.552
Comrades!

09:16.681 --> 09:19.923
General su led us to countless victories.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.972
Enemies have fallen under his sword.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.937
Let's toast our triumphs!

09:26.066 --> 09:27.431
Cheers!

09:33.698 --> 09:36.235
Ma, this is for you.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.573
I can't accept!

09:37.702 --> 09:39.818
A great sword
deserves a great warrior!

09:39.954 --> 09:42.991
- You don't like it?
- No. Of course, I do.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.706
- Then it's yours!
- Thank youl!

09:45.835 --> 09:48.793
- Put it to good use.
- Yes! I promise.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.582
Why aren't you drinking?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.179
A warrior should watch his drinking.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.017
Yuan, a sip to our victory is okay.
I'll ask them to come drink with you.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.057
With you here, I am not needed.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.354
You're my brother.
They'll respect you.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.814
You must take care of the troops
when I'm gone.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.611
Why?

10:20.161 --> 10:22.823
You're taking the promotion?
Nonsense!

10:22.956 --> 10:24.571
I've decided to go home.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.619
What? You just won a big battle.

10:28.211 --> 10:33.751
This is your time. Don't walk away.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.670
My mind's made up.
I leave tomorrow.

10:37.428 --> 10:41.467
Honestly,
you're more suited for battles.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.639
I've asked the prince
to make you governor.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.687
The prince despises me.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.272
I know.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.234
But if I'm not here.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.898
He will look at you differently.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.777
Since we were little I always
got what you didn't want.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.149
I do not feel like a man.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.283
We grew up together.
I share everything with you.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.531
You really don't want to be governor?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.415
I seek the highest ideal in wushu
so I can teach others.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.255
And I want to start my own school.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.548
When my wushu practice flourishes
I'll realise the true meaning of life.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.424
My other wish
is to have a family with ying...

11:25.560 --> 11:28.347
And live in peace together.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.765
You and my little sister... a family?

11:30.899 --> 11:33.311
Su, I wish the two of you
all the best!

11:41.326 --> 11:43.157
You've been so kind.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.868
One day...

11:45.997 --> 11:49.990
I'll repay you.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.998
Wonderful!

12:22.242 --> 12:25.905
Five years later

12:44.138 --> 12:49.258
Guests come to see my parents

12:49.394 --> 12:54.514
my parents are not in

12:54.649 --> 12:59.769
I ask the guests fo take a seat

12:59.904 --> 13:03.522
then pour them tea

13:09.038 --> 13:10.323
One more time.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.211
Snake!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.463
A snake! At your feet!

13:24.095 --> 13:25.631
You lied!

13:25.763 --> 13:28.755
Look at you.
A mother and still so rambunctious.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.133
You don't pay any attention to us.
You just practice wushu all day.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.976
Who doesn't pay attention to you?

13:34.689 --> 13:36.645
Mother! Father! What about me?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.848
Help! Save me!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.020
What's going on?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.689
I want to play.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.358
You two are parents...

13:44.490 --> 13:45.946
But act like crazy children.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.736
- Father.
- Father.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.484
Grandfather.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.450
Little feng.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.330
Give me a hug.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.292
Grandfather.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.006
Have you been good?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.467
I have some news.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.255
Yuan is coming back for a visit.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.131
My brother is coming home?

14:12.268 --> 14:15.726
After all these years...

14:17.190 --> 14:19.226
I knew he'd return one day.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.814
Ying, let's get out the best wine.
We must celebrate.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.237
My son...

14:29.660 --> 14:31.616
Yuan is now a governor.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.283
I suspect this is more
than a homecoming.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.906
You must be cautious.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.749
Father, you worry too much.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.915
Are you still thinking of his real father?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.788
Yuan never uttered a word about him.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.042
He knows why you killed his father.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.715
"Not mentioned" does not mean
"forgotten."

14:49.847 --> 14:51.963
You raised him and ying as your own.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.806
Ying is my wife. We are one family.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.393
There should be no hard feelings,
stop worrying.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.559
I hope you're right.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.920
Thank you!

15:26.676 --> 15:29.258
Thank you! This way please!

15:29.762 --> 15:31.047
Thanks.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.465
Thank you.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.964
Hurry, hurry!
Father's school opens today.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.217
I want to watch the lion dance!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.140
Lower the carriage...

15:45.945 --> 15:47.060
Raise the carriage.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.910
Do you still remember me?

16:01.586 --> 16:04.077
Of course. You're my only brother.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.794
Little feng, this is uncle yuan.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.670
Little feng.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.671
You're su's son.
You should be brave.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.139
Father really misses you.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.513
Really? Then
let's celebrate his birthday.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.106
- I have to tell you something.
- Come! Tell me tomorrow.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.186
The three of us we look like a family!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.792
My dear father...

16:50.009 --> 16:52.421
Happy birthday.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.293
Your timing is perfect.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.011
Everyone missed you.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.927
We're so happy you're home.

16:59.060 --> 17:06.023
Father, I have not re-paid you
for raising me and ying.

17:06.150 --> 17:10.063
My health has deteriorated.
Age has taken its toll.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.362
I don't have many good days.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.905
But I pray everyday for your safe return.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.455
Come.

17:23.584 --> 17:28.044
We have much to catch up on.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.835
Come!

17:36.597 --> 17:38.212
Ggrandfather!

17:42.979 --> 17:46.813
It was I who killed your father.

17:47.608 --> 17:51.396
Su loves you as his brother.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.027
Please spare his family.

17:57.702 --> 18:02.617
Father, you think so little of su,
your own son?

18:05.042 --> 18:09.126
Your father went too far
with the five venom fists.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.042
He killed many innocent people.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.505
You...

18:17.054 --> 18:19.841
I had to stop him.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.683
I have perfected the five venom fists.

18:23.811 --> 18:29.681
Did you think I will ever forget
that you murdered my father?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.619
After you killed him...

18:44.749 --> 18:47.832
Vou forced me to be your son.

18:47.960 --> 18:52.954
You told the world
my father deserved to die.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.580
Right?

18:54.717 --> 18:59.211
I am the only one you should hate.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.296
Your son stole my only sister.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.613
Governor. We've got her.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.537
Mother!

19:32.213 --> 19:34.670
Don't ever touch my sister!

19:36.467 --> 19:38.253
I never blamed you.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.003
Ying, we are finally together.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.796
What will you do to su?

19:44.308 --> 19:45.969
Uncle, what's in your hand?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.509
It's a pig's head.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.353
Let's go pay respect
to your real grandfather.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.097
Let us go!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.108
Su treated you as his blood brother.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.691
Mother.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.078
Thank you.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.539
Excuse me! This way please!

20:14.672 --> 20:17.209
Young master!
Something terrible has happened...

20:17.341 --> 20:18.672
What's going on?

20:18.801 --> 20:23.761
Yuan killed your father.
He came for revenge.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.924
Young master!

20:26.183 --> 20:27.844
Father!

23:13.225 --> 23:16.012
It's been 18 years.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.853
Today, I've finally avenged your death.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.602
Forgive me for taking so long.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.065
Come, little feng.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.441
Brother.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.907
Little feng, come here.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.628
Pay respects to your real grandfather.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.419
Governor. Su's here!

23:49.511 --> 23:51.968
Yuan, how could you?

24:05.819 --> 24:07.559
Stop!

24:07.696 --> 24:09.106
Iron twins, stand down.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.151
I must welcome my brother-in-law.

24:12.368 --> 24:15.860
Yuan! Father always
treated you as his own.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.782
How could you?

24:19.375 --> 24:22.333
Be careful, su. Run!

24:22.461 --> 24:24.247
We will be ok.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.627
Your blood will be an offering
to my father.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.333
It's dark gold armour.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.339
Sewn onto my flesh inch by inch.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.880
I am invincible.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.647
Your fist is harder than a blade.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.499
Five venom fists?

26:52.194 --> 26:53.604
Sul

27:40.993 --> 27:43.450
You know what your father
said before he died?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.573
He begged me to spare your life.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.788
You are a monster.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.455
I've hated your family for a long time.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.294
- Father!
- Little feng!

27:54.423 --> 27:55.913
Uncle!

27:56.049 --> 27:58.961
- Please don't hurt my father.
- Little feng!

28:00.470 --> 28:02.461
- Run!
- Stop! Stop!

28:03.432 --> 28:06.219
- Run, little feng!
- Uncle! Please stop!

28:06.351 --> 28:08.763
Come here, little feng. I'll stop.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.893
For the sake of your son, I'll let you go.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.066
- Su!
- Father!

28:25.162 --> 28:26.743
You're little feng's uncle.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.578
Ying! Don't!

28:29.583 --> 28:31.039
Mother!

28:31.335 --> 28:32.745
Ying!

28:34.213 --> 28:35.874
Someone save her! Ying!

28:38.258 --> 28:40.044
Governor. The water's too fast.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.382
Su.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.723
Dr. yu, he woke up!

31:34.851 --> 31:36.182
Su! Good.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.518
Now you needn't worry. He's okay.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.020
You're..

31:41.691 --> 31:42.806
This is Dr. yu.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.229
She saved our life
and treated your wounds.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.478
Ying told me everything.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.104
You are safe now.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.857
I am the only one
here on beidou mountain.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.280
You can stay as long as you like.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.074
Thank you.

31:56.206 --> 31:59.039
Keep still. There are still
traces of toxin in your blood.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.908
Luckily, you're strong.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.669
I was able to expel most of it out.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.789
Someone not as tough
would be dead by now.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.731
Be careful. My blood is toxic.

32:25.277 --> 32:29.395
Don't worry. Dr. yu
has researched every herb.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.396
She is now immune to all poisons.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.654
I am eternally grateful!

32:36.037 --> 32:38.619
I must thank ying.
She tends to the wine-making...

32:38.748 --> 32:40.955
So I can focus on my research.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.908
She's a wine-maker?

32:43.044 --> 32:46.582
She sells her wine in the city and
distributes the money to the poor.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.832
She also provides medicine to the sick.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.425
A true angel of mercy.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.216
You are making too much of what I do.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.507
These needles will aid my research.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.051
I'll walk you out.

33:02.147 --> 33:06.140
Most people harbour hatred
without realising the value of life.

33:06.276 --> 33:09.143
One life is connected to many hearts.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.154
Ying!

33:19.664 --> 33:21.120
What's wrong with my arm?

33:21.249 --> 33:22.955
The tendons are torn.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.041
Dr. yu said you'll be okay.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.752
But it will heal slowly.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.507
Eat something.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.889
You should've stayed with little feng.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.729
Why suffer here?

33:51.988 --> 33:54.070
Yuan will not harm little feng.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.358
If I didn't follow you, you would've died.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.955
I ook at me.

34:08.755 --> 34:12.498
I can't even hold a bowl of rice.
How can I save our son?

34:13.843 --> 34:15.458
You never accept defeat.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.336
I'm useless.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.008
No, you're not.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.056
You were looking for a worthy opponent.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.220
Now you've found two:

34:24.521 --> 34:27.228
Yuan and yourself.

34:31.361 --> 34:32.897
Sul

34:35.740 --> 34:38.197
su, it's ok.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.131
Here hold this.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.179
Use your right hand.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.230
Come on. Hold it.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.570
So what if I can hold it?

35:22.579 --> 35:25.116
I'm still useless!

37:42.761 --> 37:44.171
Are you all right?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.257
Are you afraid?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.385
Yes, I am.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.645
But I'm more afraid you'll give up.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.856
You're the only hope for our family.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.818
I'm waiting for you
to come to your senses.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.116
You were looking for a worthy opponent:

38:08.244 --> 38:10.860
Yuan and yourself.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.993
You're not useless.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.412
You never accept defeat.

40:07.488 --> 40:09.024
Try some.

40:22.211 --> 40:26.124
Now I understand
why your wine is so special.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.372
Why?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.874
Because it contains your essence.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.960
Stop it!

40:33.097 --> 40:36.806
Soon my strength will return,
and I will rescue our son.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.860
Great levitating skill!

41:52.343 --> 41:56.757
I've never met
a skilled master like you.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.720
Please take me as your disciple.

42:06.566 --> 42:08.022
For revenge?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.019
How did you know?

42:10.153 --> 42:12.360
Your eyes revealed everything!

42:12.488 --> 42:15.571
To be our disciple you must first
defeat the god of wushu.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.483
The god of wushu?

42:18.619 --> 42:19.734
How can I defeat him?

42:19.871 --> 42:22.829
Your right arm was injured...

42:22.957 --> 42:24.743
Now it's healed.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.037
But you've lost your confidence, right?

42:27.712 --> 42:28.712
No!

42:28.838 --> 42:31.454
I have not lost my confidence.
My arm is fine!

42:32.258 --> 42:35.591
You might die fighting the god of wushu.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.925
If my skills are weak
what's the point of living?

42:57.158 --> 43:01.527
Are you afraid yet?
Go home if you're scared.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.452
Never!

43:10.421 --> 43:11.752
Too slow.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.413
Faster! Faster!

43:55.424 --> 43:59.212
To challenge someone like you...

43:59.345 --> 44:02.678
Is a dream come true.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.798
What did they do to you?

44:05.935 --> 44:07.550
Nothing.

44:08.396 --> 44:11.684
Only the weak die at home.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.899
- A warrior dies on the battlefield.
- Su!

44:18.030 --> 44:19.861
Finally you've come to your senses.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.319
Yes, like you said...

44:22.451 --> 44:25.284
I'm the hope of our family.

44:34.422 --> 44:35.878
God of wushu!

44:37.800 --> 44:40.416
I'm here. Still alive!

44:41.345 --> 44:42.881
You've recovered?

44:47.518 --> 44:49.509
Your right arm is worthless.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.553
Let's chop it off.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.943
Scared?

45:49.080 --> 45:50.320
Again!

49:08.863 --> 49:11.024
Ying said your arm has strengthened.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.155
Take a look.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.530
Let me check how you're doing.

49:17.663 --> 49:18.903
Alright!

49:28.674 --> 49:30.710
The toxins are gone.

49:31.343 --> 49:32.924
Thank you so much.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.089
My body has healed.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.554
And I'm getting stronger each day.

49:38.517 --> 49:41.179
I must go practice. Please enjoy dinner.

49:47.443 --> 49:48.853
Ying...

49:49.445 --> 49:51.982
Su has gone mad with his training.

49:56.285 --> 49:57.741
That's not possible.

49:57.870 --> 50:01.362
Please listen. His pulse is erratic.

50:01.499 --> 50:05.412
His heart is racing
and his eyes are blood-shot.

50:05.544 --> 50:08.331
He's going mad.

50:08.464 --> 50:11.206
This can't continue.
His training must stop.

50:19.141 --> 50:22.383
Dr. yu, he's with me everyday.

50:22.520 --> 50:27.105
He goes off to the old Sage daily
and returns home with wounds.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.645
I see it with my own eyes.

50:30.277 --> 50:33.690
On beidou mountain,
we're the only ones here.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.234
I know it's hard to believe.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.074
Old Sage and the god of wushu
are supreme beings.

50:39.203 --> 50:42.070
Just like you, they come and go.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.995
- Have you ever met the old Sage?
- No.

50:48.003 --> 50:51.336
But I believe in my husband.

51:45.019 --> 51:48.386
How many times have I told you?
Do not enter my practice chamber!

51:48.522 --> 51:52.481
You don't listen!
If you die, I'll be alone forever!

51:52.610 --> 51:55.693
Uncle, my feet hurt.
Please don't lock me up.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.771
If you try to run away
I'll chop off your feet.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.774
Uncle, I won't!

52:07.291 --> 52:08.872
Little feng,

52:10.669 --> 52:12.455
you're my only family now.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.419
I will not lose you.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.714
I will protect you.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.799
So no one can harm youl.

52:27.603 --> 52:32.643
It's been another year,
I wonder how little feng has grown.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.812
I've been thinking.

52:35.944 --> 52:40.062
After I save little feng
we'll move to the country.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.565
We'll hold hands like this every day.

52:46.038 --> 52:48.575
I haven't seen your smile in a long time.

53:07.434 --> 53:08.924
Su.

53:10.229 --> 53:15.349
After you save our son
will you spare my brother's life?

53:16.360 --> 53:18.851
He's part of our family.

53:20.656 --> 53:24.820
If he lives,
I'll make sure he cannot fight again.

53:34.712 --> 53:37.374
Heavenly god.
Please bless our family.

53:37.506 --> 53:40.293
I pray that we shall never be apart.

53:42.511 --> 53:44.376
We shall never be apart.

53:46.432 --> 53:48.798
I must find a way to defeat you!

54:13.041 --> 54:15.077
Have you ever met the old Sage”?

54:17.838 --> 54:20.295
Su has gone mad with his training.

54:21.967 --> 54:23.798
God of wushu.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.469
Let's go again!

54:27.598 --> 54:29.759
You may be strong. But I'm stronger.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.883
I will defeat you!

55:05.385 --> 55:07.546
Ying. I'm home.

55:07.679 --> 55:10.671
I almost beat the god of wushu today.

55:10.808 --> 55:15.222
He's really powerful,
but I'll defeat him one day.

55:15.354 --> 55:16.469
That's enough.

55:16.605 --> 55:18.846
I now realise the way
to defeat an enemy.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.438
That's enough!

55:21.443 --> 55:23.525
What god of wushu?

55:24.071 --> 55:25.481
Are you alright?

55:26.323 --> 55:27.733
Su...

55:29.785 --> 55:32.197
Do you know you're going mad?

55:32.329 --> 55:33.739
\what?

55:35.666 --> 55:37.531
I said, you're going mad.

55:38.460 --> 55:40.166
I'm getting stronger.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.502
And I'm more powerful than before.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.082
I know you miss little feng.

55:46.218 --> 55:49.051
I went to the cliff to watch you practice.

55:51.890 --> 55:55.803
I didn't see the god of wushu,
or an old Sage.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.969
You were alone.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.852
It's all in your head. Don't you realise?

56:02.985 --> 56:04.691
You went to the cliff?

56:04.820 --> 56:06.936
I promised the masters
I wouldn't bring my wife.

56:07.072 --> 56:08.733
Wake up!

56:08.866 --> 56:12.825
You were practising by yourself.
Don't you understand?

56:13.787 --> 56:16.699
That's impossible.
Look at my wounds.

56:16.832 --> 56:18.322
They're real.

56:19.585 --> 56:21.416
You did it to yourself.

56:29.094 --> 56:32.336
I know you suffer so much.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.806
Are you not feeling well?

56:36.393 --> 56:39.009
If you love me, you have to believe me.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.722
It was you
who made me want to be strong.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.190
I need you to believe in me.

56:57.664 --> 57:01.031
Guests come to see my parents

57:01.168 --> 57:04.160
my parents are not in

57:04.963 --> 57:09.297
I ask the guests fo take a seat

57:11.511 --> 57:17.928
then pour them tea

58:00.394 --> 58:02.100
Little feng.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.436
Let's go home.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.728
Let's go, alright?

58:14.408 --> 58:16.945
If little feng hears me sing...

58:19.037 --> 58:21.073
He will stop crying.

58:27.713 --> 58:29.123
Su,

58:30.757 --> 58:32.873
we are husband and wife.

58:34.177 --> 58:37.590
We share good and bad times...

58:39.516 --> 58:41.507
And this wine together.

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:29.910
Su, you show great improvement.

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.999
Yes! I've become much stronger.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:34.370
Even your confidence has returned.

1:00:57.195 --> 1:01:00.562
Ying says I'm going insane.

1:01:00.699 --> 1:01:03.111
She says you're an illusion.

1:01:04.870 --> 1:01:07.077
- What do you think?
- Who are you?

1:01:07.205 --> 1:01:09.617
Who are you? Who am 1?
It's not important.

1:01:09.749 --> 1:01:13.082
What's important is
you're ready to save your son.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.813
Ying is right.
You are just in my head.

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:41.311
Leave me alone!
I never want to see you again!

1:01:44.534 --> 1:01:45.694
Ying!

1:01:59.299 --> 1:02:00.539
Dear su,

1:02:01.218 --> 1:02:05.211
watching you live
in your own fantasy scares me.

1:02:06.014 --> 1:02:10.178
I fear I'll lose you and our son
forever.

1:02:10.310 --> 1:02:14.223
It is now clear to me
that I must go save little feng.

1:02:14.356 --> 1:02:18.224
We made a promise.
Our family shall never be apart.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:21.351
Wait for my return. -Ying

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:29.825
Please.

1:02:36.378 --> 1:02:38.790
How long has he been in here?

1:03:01.152 --> 1:03:02.187
Little feng!

1:03:05.824 --> 1:03:06.939
Mother!

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:09.115
Little feng!

1:03:11.579 --> 1:03:14.946
I thought I'd never see you again.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:20.372
I missed you so much!

1:03:27.971 --> 1:03:30.587
- Why are you in chains?
- Hush!

1:03:30.724 --> 1:03:33.386
- Uncle may hear us.
- Ying?

1:03:38.064 --> 1:03:39.645
You're alive!

1:03:41.151 --> 1:03:43.062
This is great!

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:44.559
This is great!

1:03:44.696 --> 1:03:47.233
Finally,
we can live happily as a family.

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:55.741
It's been so long.
Do you know the pain I've endured?

1:03:56.374 --> 1:03:58.160
I think of you every day.

1:04:00.295 --> 1:04:03.753
You've had your revenge.
Now let my son go.

1:04:06.801 --> 1:04:08.166
Is su dead?

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:10.506
You destroyed his arm.

1:04:11.056 --> 1:04:14.469
He can never fight again.
Please let us go.

1:04:16.853 --> 1:04:21.313
Now that you're here
I'll never lose you again.

1:04:26.321 --> 1:04:27.811
He's here! He's here!

1:04:27.947 --> 1:04:29.403
Close the gate. Quick!

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:36.493
Governor! Su is fast approaching!

1:04:36.623 --> 1:04:37.783
Sul

1:04:47.050 --> 1:04:49.666
Ying. I am so happy.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:52.836
We can finish what we started!
It all ends here!

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:54.428
Then you must deal with me first!

1:04:56.935 --> 1:04:59.802
- Mother!
- You're scaring your son.

1:05:02.357 --> 1:05:04.188
Does this make you happy?

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:07.354
Happy?

1:05:08.822 --> 1:05:12.189
I've known only sorrow since you left.

1:05:14.285 --> 1:05:16.025
I can only fight for what I want.

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:18.361
You understand?

1:05:19.457 --> 1:05:20.492
(Good!

1:05:36.641 --> 1:05:38.177
That's more like it, su!

1:06:19.893 --> 1:06:22.555
Su, I should have trusted you!

1:06:22.687 --> 1:06:23.927
I was wrong!

1:06:24.063 --> 1:06:25.063
Ying!

1:06:43.791 --> 1:06:44.871
Guards!

1:06:46.669 --> 1:06:47.909
Tie her up.

1:06:48.796 --> 1:06:50.206
- Little feng!
- Mother!

1:06:53.051 --> 1:06:55.838
- Uncle! Don't kill her!
- Little feng!

1:06:56.304 --> 1:06:57.635
Let go!

1:07:00.475 --> 1:07:02.761
- Mother!
- I won't kill your mother.

1:07:04.187 --> 1:07:06.553
But if your father kills me...

1:07:06.689 --> 1:07:08.930
She has to die with me.

1:07:09.526 --> 1:07:11.141
Because we're one family.

1:07:12.487 --> 1:07:14.273
But I will not lose.

1:07:15.657 --> 1:07:17.272
Bury her in the forest!

1:07:20.328 --> 1:07:23.365
No matter what happens...
You must stay with your father.

1:07:23.498 --> 1:07:25.739
Remember our family
shall never be apart!

1:07:26.918 --> 1:07:29.580
Promise me, little feng!
Promise me!

1:08:14.632 --> 1:08:16.463
Governor, it's been done.

1:08:16.968 --> 1:08:20.176
- Does anyone else know where she is?
- No.

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:22.962
Good! Get up!

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.214
Yes, sir!

1:08:43.578 --> 1:08:45.569
Kill him, brother! Quick!

1:08:57.342 --> 1:08:58.457
Father!

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:02.510
Little feng!

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:05.509
- Where's your mother?
- You'll never know.

1:14:44.897 --> 1:14:46.137
Father!

1:14:46.273 --> 1:14:48.935
Father, stop! We need to find mother!

1:14:53.030 --> 1:14:54.611
Father, don't kill him!

1:14:55.366 --> 1:14:57.072
Father, you're killing him!

1:14:57.201 --> 1:14:58.201
Stop! Father!

1:14:58.327 --> 1:14:59.908
Don't kill him!

1:15:06.669 --> 1:15:10.082
Uncle, you can't die, uncle, please live!

1:15:11.215 --> 1:15:12.955
Little feng, he is our enemy!

1:15:13.426 --> 1:15:15.132
He buried mother alive.

1:15:15.261 --> 1:15:17.968
Only he knows where she is!

1:15:18.389 --> 1:15:21.222
If he dies..

1:15:23.144 --> 1:15:25.351
We can't save mother.

1:15:25.479 --> 1:15:27.140
Let's go find her!

1:15:27.940 --> 1:15:29.350
Forest.

1:15:31.193 --> 1:15:32.808
In the forest.

1:15:38.159 --> 1:15:40.275
- Ying!
- Mother!

1:15:40.911 --> 1:15:44.950
- Mother!
- Ying! Where are you?

1:16:09.065 --> 1:16:10.475
Herel

1:17:24.473 --> 1:17:27.180
A drunken fist

1:17:36.485 --> 1:17:40.569
Heilongjiang, along
the Chinese-Russian border

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:26.566
Careful! It's hot! Here it is, go!

1:18:27.369 --> 1:18:30.953
Roasted potatoes!
Sweet roasted potatoes!

1:18:34.043 --> 1:18:37.080
Mister, how much is one potato?

1:18:37.213 --> 1:18:38.999
Two copper coins.

1:18:40.341 --> 1:18:43.959
I only have one. Can I get one?

1:18:45.429 --> 1:18:48.216
Okay. Consider it charity.

1:18:48.349 --> 1:18:49.589
Here. One for you.

1:18:49.725 --> 1:18:51.056
Thank you.

1:19:18.712 --> 1:19:20.919
Teacher! Teacher!

1:19:21.048 --> 1:19:22.879
Wake up!

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:27.251
Get out!

1:19:28.555 --> 1:19:32.047
Our teacher's dead!
Money won't bring him back.

1:19:33.686 --> 1:19:37.178
Your teacher was weak.
Our fighters are better.

1:19:38.190 --> 1:19:39.555
Stop!

1:19:39.692 --> 1:19:41.102
Master ma!

1:19:41.235 --> 1:19:43.066
Head of the wushu federation?

1:19:43.195 --> 1:19:45.811
- Master ma. You need to help us.
- What happened?

1:19:45.948 --> 1:19:48.690
They lured our teacher
to a match for 30 silver coins.

1:19:48.826 --> 1:19:50.862
Said he'd get 5 coins if he surrendered...

1:19:50.995 --> 1:19:53.031
But it wasn't a match.
It was murder!

1:19:53.163 --> 1:19:55.324
Accidents happen. People die.

1:19:55.457 --> 1:19:58.449
He did surrender.
Your men still beat him to death.

1:19:58.585 --> 1:20:00.246
That's outrageous!

1:20:01.005 --> 1:20:02.461
How can you call that a match?

1:20:03.257 --> 1:20:05.919
If you have any grievances,
settle it in the arena.

1:20:06.051 --> 1:20:07.461
All right!

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:09.755
Tell your people...

1:20:09.888 --> 1:20:13.756
If I win, they'll have to close the arena
and go back to where they came from!

1:20:13.892 --> 1:20:16.304
Deal! We'll be waiting.

1:20:22.735 --> 1:20:25.727
Here. Take this. Buy something to eat.

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:41.033
Wine.

1:20:44.089 --> 1:20:45.545
Wine.

1:20:49.011 --> 1:20:51.923
Excuse me! Who is this guy?

1:20:52.056 --> 1:20:53.466
Oh my god!

1:20:53.599 --> 1:20:55.430
How did a stinky beggar get in here?

1:20:55.559 --> 1:20:57.550
This is not ying's wine.

1:20:57.686 --> 1:21:02.100
This is my wine. Give it back!

1:21:02.232 --> 1:21:04.473
Don't push me.

1:21:04.610 --> 1:21:06.146
Get out!

1:21:13.744 --> 1:21:15.154
You stink!

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:16.447
Don't touch me.

1:21:16.955 --> 1:21:18.661
Just wait!

1:21:18.791 --> 1:21:20.782
I'll get someone to kick you out.

1:21:24.463 --> 1:21:26.875
Hey, come here if you want to drink!

1:21:28.967 --> 1:21:30.173
Wine.

1:21:33.055 --> 1:21:35.467
Is this ying's wine?

1:21:38.769 --> 1:21:41.306
Drink it, and you'll know.

1:21:48.862 --> 1:21:50.443
Wine.

1:21:55.702 --> 1:21:57.408
Give me the wine!

1:22:19.435 --> 1:22:22.142
Clear head. Drunken form.

1:22:22.271 --> 1:22:24.978
Mind meets fist.

1:22:25.107 --> 1:22:27.723
Stop obsessing about form.

1:22:28.735 --> 1:22:31.727
Heart and fist are one.

1:22:45.377 --> 1:22:46.867
To lose is not to lose.

1:22:47.754 --> 1:22:49.790
To win is not to win.

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:57.385
Offer wine to the gods.

1:23:00.559 --> 1:23:04.017
Hug the barrel in farewell.

1:23:09.401 --> 1:23:12.689
Raise the jug with tons of strength.

1:23:16.992 --> 1:23:20.200
Being drunk is fake. The fist is real!

1:23:20.746 --> 1:23:23.488
A good fist is an unstoppable fist.

1:24:22.182 --> 1:24:24.298
Take it and drink up!

1:24:28.855 --> 1:24:30.937
Father!

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:34.357
A broken heart needs mending.

1:24:36.029 --> 1:24:37.985
What are you doing here?

1:24:38.574 --> 1:24:42.317
From now on, let me take you
to wherever you want to go.

1:24:42.452 --> 1:24:43.532
What a stench.

1:24:44.371 --> 1:24:47.989
Master ma, this is the lunatic
I told you about!

1:24:49.918 --> 1:24:51.328
Su can?

1:24:52.963 --> 1:24:54.123
General su?

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:56.500
He is a general?

1:25:08.812 --> 1:25:10.393
Su, it is ma.

1:25:11.356 --> 1:25:13.096
We fought many battles together.

1:25:17.446 --> 1:25:19.152
What happened to you?

1:25:19.656 --> 1:25:21.146
You don't remember me?

1:25:23.368 --> 1:25:26.155
You gave me this sword.
Don't you remember?

1:25:30.542 --> 1:25:33.158
Su, wake up!

1:25:40.010 --> 1:25:45.130
Foreigners are killing Chinese fighters
for amusement.

1:25:47.684 --> 1:25:51.302
I have to fight them tomorrow.

1:25:53.190 --> 1:25:56.057
Win or lose, I have no regrets.

1:25:57.194 --> 1:25:59.731
I've always looked up to you.

1:26:00.864 --> 1:26:02.900
A warrior once told me:

1:26:03.492 --> 1:26:06.234
"To give is better than to receive."

1:26:07.162 --> 1:26:11.121
What happened to that great warrior?

1:26:13.502 --> 1:26:18.997
He died with ying.

1:26:20.634 --> 1:26:22.044
Mother.

1:26:23.220 --> 1:26:24.380
Sul

1:26:27.224 --> 1:26:30.512
for the sake of your son
pick yourself up.

1:26:33.063 --> 1:26:34.473
Sul

1:26:35.023 --> 1:26:36.763
I return this sword to you.

1:26:39.319 --> 1:26:40.900
Mal

1:26:41.571 --> 1:26:43.732
I've never asked you for anything.

1:26:44.533 --> 1:26:47.115
Now I am asking you to take care of my
son.

1:26:48.078 --> 1:26:49.739
Father! What are you saying?

1:26:49.871 --> 1:26:52.704
Sul! He is your son!

1:26:53.458 --> 1:26:56.825
Look at me.
Do I look like a father?

1:26:59.047 --> 1:27:01.538
He has no future with me.

1:27:02.134 --> 1:27:03.999
Only suffering.

1:27:04.553 --> 1:27:07.590
I beg you. Please take him away!

1:27:10.434 --> 1:27:11.924
I see.

1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:13.675
Don't worry.

1:27:14.187 --> 1:27:16.018
I'll take good care of him.

1:27:16.148 --> 1:27:17.388
I won't go with you!

1:27:17.941 --> 1:27:19.351
Father!

1:27:20.152 --> 1:27:25.567
Don't send me away,
we must stay together.

1:27:26.366 --> 1:27:28.698
Who will take care of you
if I'm not here?

1:27:29.327 --> 1:27:33.070
Father! I won't go,
I want to stay...

1:27:33.206 --> 1:27:35.413
Father, I won't go!

1:27:35.542 --> 1:27:38.033
You don't need to take care of me.
Now go!

1:27:38.503 --> 1:27:40.585
Father! No!

1:27:41.131 --> 1:27:42.917
- Go!
- No!

1:27:44.468 --> 1:27:45.548
Listen!

1:27:46.553 --> 1:27:50.296
I only need wine, not you!
Understand?

1:27:50.766 --> 1:27:52.631
I don't want to go.

1:27:54.811 --> 1:27:56.221
Go!

1:28:03.236 --> 1:28:05.648
Father! Open the door!

1:28:06.448 --> 1:28:08.313
Open the door!

1:28:09.785 --> 1:28:11.241
I don't want to go!

1:28:11.369 --> 1:28:13.530
Open the door! Father!

1:28:42.734 --> 1:28:43.974
Uncle ma...

1:28:44.778 --> 1:28:47.235
I'm sorry, but I can't leave him.

1:28:48.114 --> 1:28:51.277
He might be crazy, but he's my father...

1:28:51.785 --> 1:28:54.948
And we cannot be apart.

1:28:56.373 --> 1:28:57.909
I understand, little feng.

1:28:59.251 --> 1:29:02.243
Come to me if you need anything.

1:29:03.129 --> 1:29:07.463
Think of me as your family.

1:29:08.885 --> 1:29:10.750
Take good care of your father.

1:29:40.667 --> 1:29:44.080
Dear father: I promised mother...

1:29:44.212 --> 1:29:45.827
That I'd always stay with you.

1:29:45.964 --> 1:29:47.545
Our family shall never be apart.

1:31:03.917 --> 1:31:05.123
Uncle ma!

1:31:06.544 --> 1:31:08.830
We've come to support you.

1:31:11.174 --> 1:31:12.289
Mal

1:31:12.634 --> 1:31:13.669
sul

1:31:17.889 --> 1:31:19.754
can you get us in”?

1:31:21.434 --> 1:31:22.640
Of course.

1:31:29.526 --> 1:31:30.606
Get out of here!

1:31:32.404 --> 1:31:33.564
Sul

1:31:34.948 --> 1:31:35.948
are you all right?

1:31:37.701 --> 1:31:40.317
What are you doing here”?
We have a dress code.

1:31:49.212 --> 1:31:52.204
He's with me. How dare you!

1:31:52.924 --> 1:31:54.505
After you.

1:32:43.308 --> 1:32:45.173
I need to check something.

1:32:47.937 --> 1:32:49.928
We know you'll win, uncle ma!

1:33:03.161 --> 1:33:07.029
Now, the most important match
of the day!

1:33:07.165 --> 1:33:10.202
The challenger is master ma...

1:33:13.379 --> 1:33:18.248
Head of the wushu federation.

1:33:19.552 --> 1:33:20.667
Versus..

1:33:21.262 --> 1:33:24.675
Killer Anton's invincible wrestlers.

1:33:29.687 --> 1:33:32.178
This is a free-style match.

1:33:32.732 --> 1:33:35.565
No time limits. No holds barred.

1:33:35.693 --> 1:33:37.979
No set number of fighters.

1:33:38.113 --> 1:33:40.695
No weapons allowed.

1:33:40.824 --> 1:33:44.442
The last man standing wins.

1:33:44.577 --> 1:33:47.614
The prize is 100 silver coins!

1:33:49.541 --> 1:33:52.203
The odds right now are fifteen to one.

1:33:52.335 --> 1:33:54.200
Final bets now.

1:34:09.310 --> 1:34:11.426
The challenger...

1:34:12.689 --> 1:34:14.805
Master ma!

1:34:20.655 --> 1:34:23.271
The defending champion: Malotoff.

1:34:27.370 --> 1:34:30.578
Are both fighters ready?

1:34:31.833 --> 1:34:33.448
Ready!

1:34:34.210 --> 1:34:36.201
Go!

1:35:25.011 --> 1:35:26.751
Stop! Uncle ma!

1:35:37.899 --> 1:35:39.264
Don't hurt uncle ma!

1:35:44.739 --> 1:35:46.229
Let me go!

1:35:47.158 --> 1:35:48.158
Father!

1:35:50.954 --> 1:35:54.117
Father! Help! Father!

1:35:54.249 --> 1:35:55.659
Let me go!

1:35:55.792 --> 1:35:56.998
Father!

1:36:30.576 --> 1:36:33.033
Uncle ma! Are you okay?

1:39:03.938 --> 1:39:05.269
Father! Be careful!

1:39:41.559 --> 1:39:44.596
Father, don't fight anymore!
Run away!

1:39:44.729 --> 1:39:47.971
Little feng, I never back down.

1:42:10.458 --> 1:42:13.165
Father, please stop!

1:42:33.105 --> 1:42:35.187
Father, please stop!

1:43:02.927 --> 1:43:04.667
He just violated the rules.

1:43:14.271 --> 1:43:15.636
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:43:16.899 --> 1:43:18.309
Stay back!

1:43:18.442 --> 1:43:22.105
The last player of killer Anton's is off.

1:43:22.988 --> 1:43:26.572
The chinaman is the only one left.

1:43:27.618 --> 1:43:29.028
Get up!

1:43:29.161 --> 1:43:30.617
In accordance with the rules.

1:43:31.831 --> 1:43:34.072
If he can get up...

1:43:34.208 --> 1:43:35.414
Get up!

1:43:35.543 --> 1:43:38.410
He is the winner.

1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:43.247
- Get up, father!
- Su.

1:43:46.011 --> 1:43:49.469
Father, I beg you. Get up!

1:43:54.353 --> 1:43:58.437
Please don't die.

1:43:58.566 --> 1:44:02.058
Father, I beg you. Get up.

1:44:16.417 --> 1:44:17.907
Sul

1:44:22.923 --> 1:44:24.629
Get up!

1:44:36.437 --> 1:44:38.052
Ying!

1:44:42.234 --> 1:44:44.065
Did you see that?

1:44:44.820 --> 1:44:48.233
I knew it.
You've perfected your skills.

1:44:51.243 --> 1:44:52.949
Don't leave me again.

1:44:53.746 --> 1:44:56.283
I've never left you.

1:44:57.291 --> 1:44:59.623
I was always by your side.

1:45:11.514 --> 1:45:14.722
Father, wake up, get up quickly.

1:45:14.850 --> 1:45:17.307
Father, get up.

1:45:17.436 --> 1:45:23.397
Father, wake up!

1:45:23.526 --> 1:45:27.018
Get up, father! Don't leave me.

1:45:35.913 --> 1:45:38.700
Get up! Quick!

1:45:42.586 --> 1:45:46.625
He's up. The chinaman is up!

1:45:46.757 --> 1:45:49.499
He wins!

1:45:54.014 --> 1:45:58.474
The loser will be banned from this arena.

1:45:59.228 --> 1:46:01.514
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:46:01.647 --> 1:46:05.356
According to our rules...

1:46:05.484 --> 1:46:08.066
The last man standing wins.

1:46:08.195 --> 1:46:10.026
And today's winner is...

1:46:10.155 --> 1:46:13.818
The Chinese man on this stage.

1:46:19.123 --> 1:46:20.738
That is my father!

1:47:16.639 --> 1:47:20.177
Beggar su wandered the land
with his son...

1:47:22.144 --> 1:47:27.389
Searching for truth through
the "drunken fist" philosophy.

1:47:29.777 --> 1:47:36.114
Today, it is practiced
by millions around the world...

1:47:37.201 --> 1:47:43.322
And its creator, su can
is indeed a "true legend" of wushu.

1:48:09.525 --> 1:48:12.767
Kid, let me teach you a trick.

1:48:15.072 --> 1:48:16.937
I ook at me.

1:48:18.742 --> 1:48:21.449
I saw the hole in the first place.

1:48:21.578 --> 1:48:22.988
You are a fake.
