00:19.920 --> 00:24.198
<i>For 74 years, the might
of Soviet socialism was so great</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:27.669
<i>it split the world
along Eastern and Western lines.</i>

00:27.828 --> 00:32.607
<i>Then, in 1991,
it collapsed completely.</i>

00:32.799 --> 00:36.747
<i>One by one, the various countries
which had supported the Soviet Union</i>

00:36.904 --> 00:38.315
<i>began splitting away,</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:40.348
<i>declaring their independence.</i>

00:40.741 --> 00:42.948
<i>The parliament
of the Eastern Slav Republic</i>

00:43.110 --> 00:46.580
<i>followed suit, declaring
the country a sovereign state,</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:49.728
<i>independent from Soviet rule.</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:52.060
<i>Capitalism advanced rapidly.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:55.223
<i>The conglomerates gained influence
in political circles,</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:58.334
<i>and as a result,
the oligarchs came into power.</i>

00:58.592 --> 01:00.299
<i>In the Eastern Slav Republic,</i>

01:00.460 --> 01:03.304
the divide between rich and <i>poor</i>
became so great

01:03.463 --> 01:06.467
<i>it ignited the fuse of a new rebellion.</i>

01:07.901 --> 01:09.403
<i>The push for independence</i>

01:09.570 --> 01:11.208
<i>exploded into the streets.</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:14.978
<i>Armed freedom fighters pitted
themselves against their government,</i>

01:15.142 --> 01:17.748
<i>now controlled by the oligarchs.</i>

01:19.046 --> 01:21.287
<i>The military prospered
during this time,</i>

01:21.448 --> 01:24.054
<i>becoming ever stronger
and better equipped.</i>

01:24.217 --> 01:26.424
<i>Under the guidance
of Ivan Judanovich,</i>

01:26.587 --> 01:28.760
<i>an Ataman
from the Council of Elders,</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:30.959
<i>the freedom fighters
moved their base</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:32.802
<i>to a hidden location.</i>

01:32.993 --> 01:35.473
<i>A more suitable place to launch</i>

01:35.629 --> 01:38.075
<i>their guerrilla war
against the government.</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:42.337
<i>After several years of brutal fighting,</i>

01:42.502 --> 01:44.448
<i>it was Svetlana Belikova,</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:46.915
<i>Eastern Slav's first female president,</i>

01:47.074 --> 01:50.248
<i>who offered a ceasefire
to the freedom fighters.</i>

01:51.912 --> 01:54.449
<i>But the break from hostilities
was short-lived.</i>

01:54.615 --> 01:57.459
<i>In November of 2010,
the government discovered</i>

01:57.618 --> 02:00.462
<i>that the rebels' land
contained valuable resources.</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:02.658
<i>The military continued
their attacks,</i>

02:02.823 --> 02:05.303
<i>claiming they were
fighting terrorism.</i>

02:06.326 --> 02:09.535
<i>Losing one base after another
to the military's onslaught,</i>

02:09.696 --> 02:12.336
<i>the freedom fighters
escalated their efforts</i>

02:12.499 --> 02:15.275
<i>and became more and more
radical in their tactics.</i>

02:15.502 --> 02:17.311
<i>It was then that strange rumors</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:20.111
<i>began spreading like wildfire
among the people</i>

02:20.440 --> 02:22.681
<i>that monsters had joined the battle.</i>

02:23.910 --> 02:25.787
<i>In February of 2011,</i>

02:25.946 --> 02:28.688
<i>the rumors made it to
the old city of Holifgrad,</i>

02:28.849 --> 02:31.728
<i>just a few kilometers
from the Presidential Palace,</i>

02:31.918 --> 02:34.865
<i>an important strategic location
for the government.</i>

02:48.502 --> 02:52.211
Listen to the <i>words</i> of the elders.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.546
<i>We have finally gained
the power that we need.</i>

02:58.879 --> 03:02.554
<i>Power that will lead us to victory.</i>

03:03.884 --> 03:05.557
<i>Gather, people.</i>

03:07.320 --> 03:09.698
<i>Gather and fight.</i>

03:10.590 --> 03:13.696
Fight for independence!

03:25.572 --> 03:28.280
Retreat! We're getting slaughtered!

03:30.077 --> 03:31.215
Another rebel!

03:31.411 --> 03:33.049
<i>Do not resist arrest.</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:35.193
<i>- Retreat!
- Drop your weapons.</i>

03:35.348 --> 03:36.725
Surrender immediately.
- Government pigs!

03:36.883 --> 03:39.420
<i>I repeat, do not resist arrest.</i>

03:39.619 --> 03:41.621
<i>Surrender immediately.</i>

04:02.442 --> 04:04.217
Moving into position.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.413
<i>COPY-</i>

04:07.047 --> 04:09.323
I've got a clear view
of you from the sky.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.888
Great.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.694
Maybe you can help me find
a clear route to the CIA drop-off.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.306
Looks like they're doing some
serious renovations down here.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.278
<i>Listen to me carefully, Leon.</i>

04:31.438 --> 04:33.315
<i>Your mission has been aborted.</i>

04:33.473 --> 04:36.249
<i>The U. S. is going to pull out
of the country.</i>

04:36.409 --> 04:38.446
What? I just got here.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.852
After taking me off furlough
and sending me to this

04:41.081 --> 04:42.321
godforsaken place?

04:42.482 --> 04:43.825
What the hell?

04:43.984 --> 04:47.932
<i>Washington and the government there
have decided to go their separate ways.</i>

04:48.088 --> 04:50.466
<i>Everyone has to leave,
not just embassy staff</i>

04:50.624 --> 04:54.436
<i>All American citizens have been
ordered to evacuate the country.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:56.505
I don't give a damn
about the politics.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.974
We've got confirmation that B.O.W.s
are being used in this war.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.635
If we don't stop them now,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.941
the same shit will
happen everywhere.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.879
Do you really wanna see that?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.518
This is a war
and things are different.

05:08.675 --> 05:12.020
No one can do anything without backup
from the American government.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.214
Not even you.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.156
Well then, I guess
my only option is to

05:16.316 --> 05:18.728
lose my American
citizenship for a while.

05:18.885 --> 05:19.886
<i>Leon!</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:23.164
She can tell them I got lost
and missed my flight.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.903
Better hurry up and get this done.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.871
I need some breakfast.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.394
Scarecrow.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.330
I'm the Tin Man.
Can you talk?

07:05.559 --> 07:09.405
What's the connection between the
anti-government forces and the B.O.W.s?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.412
I guess scarecrows
aren't known

07:14.567 --> 07:16.137
for rousing
conversation.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.405
Hang in there.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.982
I'll get you out of here.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.585
Bee--

07:23.910 --> 07:25.253
What?

07:25.779 --> 07:26.849
Say that again.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.786
Bee

07:29.316 --> 07:30.624
keeper.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.354
Beekeeper?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.996
The honeybee I saw outside.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.348
Great. Now I got a
cowardly lion to deal with.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.920
It's the army.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.821
Is anyone here?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.627
Check the room down there.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.836
Hey-- Unh!

10:32.599 --> 10:34.704
Don't say a word.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.314
How about that one?
Shh.

10:42.675 --> 10:43.847
Huh?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.722
This one's clear.

10:55.922 --> 10:56.992
Clear.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.634
- This one's clear.
- We're moving on.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.066
Pull out.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.698
They're gone.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.741
We better stay here
a while longer.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.514
They may come back.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.223
Do you think our hostage

11:21.381 --> 11:22.587
will be of any use?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.757
Do you know who we are?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.565
Are you Dorothy?

11:30.723 --> 11:34.330
You people in the CIA
call us terrorists.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.334
But we prefer to call ourselves

11:37.864 --> 11:40.902
pro-independence fighters.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.771
What is the CIA
doing here?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.376
Did you put the
government up to this?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.950
Are there any more
of you?

11:48.107 --> 11:49.552
I'm not a CIA agent.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.781
I'm just an American who was
screwed out of his vacation,

11:52.979 --> 11:55.084
dumped on a plane
and brought here.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.249
Without breakfast.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.093
They came for you
while you were on vacation?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.287
Hey, Buddy.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.229
He's got to be high up
in the CIA for them to do that.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.126
You watch too many movies.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.770
Then what are you?

12:06.926 --> 12:08.906
Is it common for people in America

12:09.062 --> 12:11.599
to be packing one of these
while on vacation?

12:12.065 --> 12:15.137
Sure. We've been doing it since
the country was founded.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.804
Wow, America's the bomb, yo!

12:18.204 --> 12:19.512
Eh.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.145
Whatever.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.218
But even if you're not CIA,

12:23.376 --> 12:26.084
there is no doubt you
must be pretty special

12:26.246 --> 12:28.658
for America to send you here.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.656
You were able to take on
that thing, after all.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.162
If you don't stop messing around
with that thing,

12:34.320 --> 12:36.061
you're gonna get us all killed.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.829
There is no doubt about the fact
that you are our enemy.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.145
<i>An anti-terrorist
sweep is now in operation.</i>

12:57.310 --> 12:58.516
<i>Civilians should avoid</i>

12:58.678 --> 13:00.624
<i>going outside
as much as possible.</i>

13:00.780 --> 13:04.159
<i>If you see any suspicious
people or behavior,</i>

13:04.317 --> 13:06.661
<i>report it to the authorities
immediately.</i>

13:08.554 --> 13:09.658
Hm.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.636
Status.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.040
Some escaped underground.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.610
But it's only a matter of time
before they are rounded up.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.145
Tell me in more detail.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.941
When, exactly?

13:25.104 --> 13:26.811
Well...

13:27.073 --> 13:28.347
Um...

13:29.342 --> 13:30.377
You see--

13:30.576 --> 13:34.718
How many times are you going
to make the same mistake?

13:37.784 --> 13:41.994
We should have become a member
of the United Nations five years ago.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.662
And by now
be a respected member

13:44.824 --> 13:48.897
of the international community
in our role as an EU nation.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.905
But before that could happen,

13:52.098 --> 13:55.136
another group came crawling
out of the sewers,

13:55.301 --> 13:58.748
screaming their declarations
of separatism.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.748
And the main cause of this

14:00.907 --> 14:05.879
is because you allowed
the terrorists to do as they please.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.823
If we don't act soon,

14:09.983 --> 14:14.659
we will lose our chance
for true independence forever.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.192
And we cannot
allow that to happen

14:18.358 --> 14:20.702
at any cost.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.199
Madam President.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.777
Your visitor has arrived.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.072
Show her in.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.587
Welcome to Eastern Slav,
my dear.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.124
I am President Svetlana Belikova.

14:42.281 --> 14:46.127
Gentlemen, allow me to
introduce you to our guest.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.925
This young lady
is a special investigator

14:49.088 --> 14:52.934
for the United Nations'
Bio-terrorism Security Alliance.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.769
Good day, Madam President.

14:55.928 --> 14:56.963
Gentlemen.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.872
I have been sent here by the BSAA.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.809
My name is Ada Wong.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.460
Hey, you.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.766
My name is not,
"Hey, you."

15:22.922 --> 15:24.799
I'm JD.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.934
Although that's not
my real name.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.104
The old man's
not looking too good.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.967
He always looks like that.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.102
Let's hope you're right.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.983
Anyways, what are you
really doing in this country?

15:44.143 --> 15:46.316
Hey, a different question
for a change.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.649
Ugh. What I mean is,

15:47.814 --> 15:50.158
being in America
is a lot more fun than

15:50.316 --> 15:51.454
being here, right?

15:51.617 --> 15:52.857
I wouldn't know.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.464
The hamburgers, man.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.621
The fried chicken.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.529
Food in your country's
fantastic.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.430
I could eat it every day.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.667
Thanks for the valuable insight.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.535
And the Hollywood movies.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.174
I love those things.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.106
I have 50 DVDs.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.643
None of them are pirated.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.213
I thought you guys hated America.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.872
Sure, we hate it.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.446
But things made in America?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.110
Now, that's different.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.530
Whatever you do,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.199
don't push that button.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.230
I'm not falling for that.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.565
No way I'll allow them
to trace the call.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.214
How are things
out there?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.409
Looks like they have the old pan
of the city surrounded.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.985
We'd better wait and see
how things pan out.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.424
<i>Bio Organic Weapons.</i>

16:54.580 --> 16:56.184
<i>Also known as</i>

16:56.349 --> 16:57.987
B.O.W.s.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.189
Most developed countries
and the United Nations

17:01.354 --> 17:04.892
are against the use and
manufacture of B.O.W.s.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.401
However, they are, unfortunately,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.165
still traded on the
world's black markets.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.601
From a quick glance at this report,

17:12.798 --> 17:16.176
I'd say that using these weapons
in a real conflict

17:16.335 --> 17:18.611
would be extremely
impractical, no?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.780
There's no way to differentiate

17:20.940 --> 17:22.920
between friend and foe.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.055
It is true that total control

17:25.211 --> 17:27.281
of most of the B.O.W.s

17:27.445 --> 17:30.120
has been nearly impossible
up until now.

17:30.616 --> 17:34.291
But a new technology
that changes that fact

17:34.453 --> 17:36.933
has recently been developed.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.364
Tell me more.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.296
Recent technological advancements

17:42.461 --> 17:46.307
can establish
a master/slave relationship

17:46.465 --> 17:49.537
between a human and the B.O.W.s.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.807
So? What do they do,
crack whips at it?

17:52.972 --> 17:54.747
Like they do with wild animals?

17:57.209 --> 17:58.779
Not exactly.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.885
Organisms, designed to determine

18:02.048 --> 18:06.326
whether a host is to be
a controller or a controlee

18:06.485 --> 18:09.591
take up residence
within the host's body

18:09.755 --> 18:13.669
and creates the perfect
master/slave relationship

18:13.860 --> 18:15.601
between a human
and the B.O.W.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.099
Similar to the relationship

18:18.297 --> 18:20.868
a queen bee shares
with her worker bees.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.288
Yo, bro. Can I speak
to you for a moment?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.758
What about?

18:38.918 --> 18:40.761
It's about Ataman.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.025
It could be dangerous
to move him now.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.830
And your American friend has
also taken quite an interest in him.

18:49.495 --> 18:50.701
You don't--

18:52.164 --> 18:55.043
You don't have to worry
about me.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.845
We can't stay here forever.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.054
Who's in there?
Open the door.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.683
- Anyone there?
- Open the door.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.726
Open up!
- Stop resisting

19:12.918 --> 19:14.295
and come out.
- Step back.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.828
Three, two,

19:16.489 --> 19:17.593
One!

19:21.027 --> 19:23.667
Don't move. Hands in the air.
Don't move.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.672
Stay still.
Don't shoot.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.311
Drop your guns!

19:28.834 --> 19:30.677
Let's go. Take them away.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.220
Keep away

19:47.386 --> 19:48.831
from him!

19:53.893 --> 19:55.167
He's turned!

20:22.188 --> 20:23.531
Downstairs.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.134
Someone is in the basement.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.930
Shoot. Shoot!

20:28.094 --> 20:29.903
Quick, run!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.136
Are you all right?

21:01.293 --> 21:02.601
Ataman.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.641
We have to hurry.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.245
They'll be here soon.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.673
You...

21:10.836 --> 21:13.749
go on ahead.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.477
Damn, just when things
were going well.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.853
We can win this war,

21:20.045 --> 21:21.285
can't we?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.755
JD.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.088
It's-- It's time

21:25.251 --> 21:27.162
for me to go.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.460
But I'll be rooting for you

21:29.622 --> 21:31.192
from heaven.

21:34.126 --> 21:39.166
Ugh. Get up, you idiot. You think that
vest you're wearing is a girl's blouse?

21:39.965 --> 21:42.138
We have to get Ataman
away from here.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.642
Huh?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.841
Wow. I should have guessed.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.111
Made in America.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.844
Wait.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.489
Where's the American?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.090
Dead, probably.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.458
Give me a hand.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.965
Leave me here.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.135
If we go on like this,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.037
we'll all be killed

22:10.196 --> 22:12.176
before we can launch an attack

22:12.331 --> 22:14.004
on the capital.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.740
Go.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.011
Create a new future.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.138
This way. I heard gunshots.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.300
They're here.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.781
I'm going to go
and check on Marco.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.745
You head to the church
and join the others.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.619
Okay.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.713
Shh.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.147
Hm?

25:17.816 --> 25:20.092
Do you really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.598
Aah!

25:27.192 --> 25:29.502
Kill you.
Do I look like I need a pruning?

25:33.432 --> 25:34.934
Don't kill him!

25:35.167 --> 25:36.942
That's one request I can't grant.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.105
Ugh!

25:40.305 --> 25:42.251
Mr. Chenkov.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.744
I told you

25:44.910 --> 25:46.048
not to kill him.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.247
He was my teacher.
It was him or me.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.222
And don't forget,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.362
he wasn't your teacher anymore.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.056
Ugh!

26:11.570 --> 26:12.605
Shoot.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.050
Shoot, JD!

27:09.928 --> 27:13.205
Why the hell carry that gun around
if you're not gonna use it?

27:15.601 --> 27:16.807
Don't worry.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.812
I'll use it next time.

27:34.953 --> 27:39.026
If you ever decide to shoot those things,
shoot them in the head, got it?

27:40.425 --> 27:41.495
Wait.

27:42.961 --> 27:44.167
This way.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.533
Two grown men
should be able to open it.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.273
So, what is this place?

28:18.464 --> 28:21.502
Old partisans used to
hole up here

28:21.667 --> 28:22.771
back in the day.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.244
They sure knew how
to keep the enemy out.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.547
This thing ain't gonna budge.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.783
Stand back.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.486
That way.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.996
This way.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.416
Quick.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.440
Oh, I knew I should have

29:27.599 --> 29:28.907
stayed off the

29:29.067 --> 29:30.444
junk food.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.650
Hurry LIP

30:46.979 --> 30:48.822
Get away!

30:49.248 --> 30:51.489
Get him.
Stay away from me!

30:52.017 --> 30:53.621
Get him.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.189
No.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.901
- No. No!
- Get him.

31:01.660 --> 31:02.695
Aah!

31:02.861 --> 31:05.535
Please, somebody help me!
Help me!

31:06.264 --> 31:07.800
What's happening?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.271
Stay away! No!

31:13.372 --> 31:14.783
Get away!

31:14.940 --> 31:16.180
Help!

32:23.642 --> 32:25.451
What happened to everybody?

32:27.279 --> 32:29.088
Anywhere we can hide?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.261
Yeah.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.541
What did you do
to everybody?

33:21.766 --> 33:23.905
The Plaga you were
hiding got loose.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.980
I don't know what
you're talking about!

33:26.171 --> 33:29.243
Your precious townsfolk are
being controlled by a parasite.

33:29.408 --> 33:33.083
It attaches itself to the central
nervous system via the spinal cord.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.983
The people of the town are--?

33:35.180 --> 33:37.182
They'll never be normal again.

33:38.884 --> 33:42.195
There must be something we can do.
Rip out the spinal cord,

33:42.354 --> 33:45.358
but the best you could hope for
is paralysis or death.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.525
You are lying!

33:46.725 --> 33:50.195
If you really believe that,
then why did you kill the old man?

33:50.562 --> 33:51.870
But that was--

33:52.030 --> 33:55.671
Because you knew he would
never be human again.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.612
What he says is true.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.847
I have some more
questions for you.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.465
Maybe this time
we can get to the truth.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.752
What are we going to do?

34:41.580 --> 34:44.322
I have to go and get it.
Go and get it?

34:44.483 --> 34:45.553
Why?

34:45.717 --> 34:48.630
We need somebody
to take over for Ataman.

34:49.454 --> 34:52.400
You've seen what's
happening outside.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.467
Do you want that to happen to you?

34:58.130 --> 35:01.407
What we do today will carry
the country into tomorrow.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.907
But even so...

35:06.471 --> 35:08.781
I'll meet up with the others
tomorrow to plan

35:08.940 --> 35:10.977
an attack on the
Presidential Palace.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.754
Get ready for that.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.960
I'll be back soon.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.056
I want a word with him.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.835
He's gone to get it.
The Plaga?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.569
I don't know its name.

36:09.734 --> 36:13.511
All I know is that it was
given to us by the elders.

36:24.382 --> 36:27.886
You inject that stuff into your body
to control the Lickers, right?

36:28.053 --> 36:30.192
Some compassionate elders
you got there.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.164
What other options do we have?

36:32.324 --> 36:34.770
Do you realize
that the whole world ignores us?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.962
That we are in danger
of extermination?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.236
Save your breath.

36:39.397 --> 36:42.105
We're not gonna see
eye to eye on this.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.206
Help us.

36:47.072 --> 36:49.609
I don't want to see him
change into a monster.

36:51.976 --> 36:54.047
Irina would not be happy
about this.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.492
Irina?

36:58.917 --> 37:01.227
We knew her
since we were kids.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.229
Buddy's fiancée.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.065
She was a school teacher
and, believe it or not,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.364
so was Buddy.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.870
Bastards thought
their school

37:12.030 --> 37:14.601
was a pro-independence
hideout and attacked it.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.206
Irina and the kids died in the attack.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.728
<i>That's the reason why
he's fighting this war.</i>

37:44.295 --> 37:47.139
<i>He had never even held
a gun up until then.</i>

38:11.990 --> 38:14.095
I'm going to pretend you escaped.

38:15.193 --> 38:19.266
In return, you must get
ahold of it before he does.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.172
So now you trust me?

38:23.668 --> 38:26.274
I don't know who or what you are,

38:26.438 --> 38:28.884
but I do know that
you saved my life.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.387
You must stop Sasha.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.499
You'll find him
in the central marketplace.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.875
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.739
The operation begins at 2000 hours.

39:29.934 --> 39:32.437
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

40:16.481 --> 40:17.551
Looking for someone?

40:26.558 --> 40:27.593
Ada.

40:36.801 --> 40:39.111
It's been a long time, Leon.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.218
What are you doing here?

40:43.975 --> 40:46.956
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.250
Did you release
the Plaga?

40:49.581 --> 40:51.322
Don't make me laugh.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.229
I'm not interested
in defective products.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.091
I'm just here to lend them
a hand.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.966
Them?

41:00.358 --> 41:03.168
Although it seems as if
my help wasn't needed.

41:03.361 --> 41:05.341
What are you doing here?

41:05.730 --> 41:07.209
If they attack the capital,

41:07.365 --> 41:09.504
it'll make my job a lot easier.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.042
That's all.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.744
By the way,

41:14.305 --> 41:17.548
when are we going to, um, carry on

41:17.742 --> 41:19.779
from where we left off that night?

41:20.011 --> 41:23.151
Heh. Any time but now.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.954
You're angry with me, aren't you?

41:27.952 --> 41:29.260
Suits you.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.402
Quick word of warning.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.768
This town will be purged soon!

41:46.204 --> 41:47.842
Women.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.595
General?

42:00.885 --> 42:02.091
Yes.

42:04.656 --> 42:07.569
You may start the attack
when you are ready.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.068
Thank you.

42:12.830 --> 42:16.073
Bring Ada Wong to me.
She should see this.

42:49.634 --> 42:52.547
Great. I get to play Santa Claus.

43:48.092 --> 43:49.196
Are you all right?

43:49.661 --> 43:52.141
Yeah, just let my guard
down for a moment.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.778
They got us pretty good.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.488
Where's Buddy?
He already left by the time I got there.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.827
Damn!
We have to leave now.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.300
The military's gonna
burn the whole area

44:21.459 --> 44:22.961
and everything in it.

44:23.127 --> 44:25.471
What?
We're out of time

44:30.968 --> 44:32.538
What's wrong?

44:34.372 --> 44:36.079
Nothing.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.311
There's just something
I have to do.

45:03.234 --> 45:05.043
Won't you be needing that?

45:10.274 --> 45:11.344
Hm.

45:13.277 --> 45:14.347
Hm.

45:21.119 --> 45:23.065
Ah, you my man. Heh, heh.

45:26.190 --> 45:27.692
Buddy.

45:31.028 --> 45:33.565
Cool. You're still human.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.238
JD.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.039
You. What have you done?

45:40.404 --> 45:42.543
No. He's not our enemy. He's--

45:44.108 --> 45:45.815
I'm fine. Just go.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.649
I don't want to cause
any more trouble.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.564
It's time to say goodbye.

46:09.333 --> 46:10.641
JD!

46:13.304 --> 46:14.305
Wait.

46:28.686 --> 46:32.463
You know, I didn't really care
about independence.

46:33.324 --> 46:38.364
All I wanted was to have fun
with you and my friends.

46:38.563 --> 46:39.871
And...

47:02.220 --> 47:04.666
I was looking forward
to showing you America.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.372
Trust me,

47:21.105 --> 47:23.608
I've seen this
happen every time.

47:33.484 --> 47:35.327
When you're dealing with B.O.W.s,

47:35.486 --> 47:38.194
there's no difference
between friend or enemy.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.695
It takes everything from you:

47:40.858 --> 47:44.931
The cause you're fighting for,
the respect you have for others.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.234
We have to keep this from
ever happening again.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.378
Give me the Plaga.

47:56.407 --> 47:59.081
As far as I am concerned,

48:00.044 --> 48:04.515
there is no difference between
this and using B.O.W.s.

48:12.924 --> 48:15.734
If you want to keep this
from happening again,

48:16.927 --> 48:19.032
put down your gun.

48:23.167 --> 48:24.874
Well, then.

48:25.403 --> 48:27.405
That is my answer...

48:28.439 --> 48:29.543
and your answer.

48:53.097 --> 48:56.977
The eradication of the B.O.W.s
is moving ahead according to plan.

48:57.935 --> 49:01.075
You mustn't allow even one of them
to escape the city.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.309
We are prepared for all
eventualities, madam.

49:04.475 --> 49:07.456
And one more thing,
regarding Ada Wong.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.515
Did you find anything out?

49:10.147 --> 49:13.424
There is no one working for the BSAA
by the name of Ada Wong.

49:14.852 --> 49:16.195
Are you serious?

49:16.354 --> 49:18.027
Yes, madam.

49:18.823 --> 49:20.097
Hm.

49:21.425 --> 49:22.995
Of course.

49:40.678 --> 49:41.884
Central gate.

49:42.046 --> 49:43.218
<i>Report your status.</i>

49:43.380 --> 49:44.859
Central gate reporting.

49:45.016 --> 49:46.723
All is calm.
- Roger.

49:46.884 --> 49:48.864
Keep your eyes peeled.

49:52.523 --> 49:54.161
<i>Three trucks are approaching.</i>

49:54.325 --> 49:56.066
<i>Heads up, everyone.</i>

50:06.837 --> 50:08.214
Halt.

50:08.372 --> 50:09.407
Halt!

50:51.549 --> 50:53.426
Where did you go last night?

50:53.584 --> 50:55.359
You were not in the hotel.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.693
I went to meet an old friend.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.059
And this old friend...

51:02.259 --> 51:04.239
is he a spy?

51:07.932 --> 51:08.933
Hm.

51:09.133 --> 51:12.376
Who are you working for?
The Russians?

51:12.536 --> 51:14.311
The Americans?

51:14.472 --> 51:16.918
I'll leave that
to your imagination.

51:17.208 --> 51:20.917
Considering that you will never be
leaving this country again,

51:21.078 --> 51:24.958
I would say it is in your best interests
to stay on my good side.

51:29.153 --> 51:30.496
Very funny.

52:23.507 --> 52:27.956
So it's true what they said
about you being a former instructor.

52:28.279 --> 52:29.314
Hm.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.689
Former? I still am an instructor.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.034
Yes?

53:21.165 --> 53:24.146
The terrorists broke through the
central gate.

53:31.075 --> 53:34.955
As I said, we have decided
to delay your departure.

53:35.112 --> 53:36.614
Permanently.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.438
Now, that's impressive.

54:19.590 --> 54:20.625
I keep saying

54:20.791 --> 54:22.737
these things make bad pets.

54:31.335 --> 54:35.511
<i>We are under attack by terrorists.
We need reinforcements, now!</i>

54:35.673 --> 54:38.654
<i>We can't defend
the palace much longer. Aah!</i>

56:26.951 --> 56:30.091
Sony, but I don't have time to stay
and chat right now.

57:17.634 --> 57:19.477
Amateurs.

57:20.137 --> 57:22.310
They didn't even
give me a pat-down.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.341
I didn't expect to get into
this place so easily.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.819
Pretty impressive for

58:36.013 --> 58:37.390
an old nuclear shelter.

58:48.425 --> 58:51.201
Heh. So you missed me, huh?

58:52.796 --> 58:55.606
Yeah. In your dreams.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.307
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

58:59.036 --> 59:00.208
Uh-huh.

59:01.505 --> 59:03.451
It's like a beehive.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.629
Have you looked inside
one of these?

59:20.958 --> 59:22.733
It's the Plaga.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.033
Hmm.

59:25.262 --> 59:27.139
Big surprise.

59:32.202 --> 59:34.409
Workers have been
cultivated in the past.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.448
But this...

59:37.341 --> 59:40.447
This is the first time that
the dominant members

59:40.611 --> 59:43.387
of the species have been cultured.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.284
What are you doing?

59:46.450 --> 59:49.329
I'm working.
Don't worry about it.

59:49.486 --> 59:50.624
Oh, I'm worried.

59:50.787 --> 59:52.266
Enough!

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:05.072
So this is what you're here for.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.339
Well?

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:07.607
Are you satisfied?

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.116
Yes, thank you very much.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.454
Who is he?

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.748
I don't know.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.149
He's an American agent.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.287
Well, now that we got that
out of the way...

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.820
An American?

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.000
You'd better watch out.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.602
That old broad's got a bite
worse than her bark.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.261
Say what?

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.108
Over there! Over there! Shoot!

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.843
Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Unh!

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.951
Ceasefire!

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.131
Don't move.

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:13.675
Do you have any idea

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.317
who you are pointing
your gun at?

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.651
Hmm. Yeah, let me see.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:20.845
You're the beekeeper.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.581
The beekeeper?

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:25.352
The person who
released the Plaga.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:30.489
Just as I thought,
you haven't a clue.

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:34.363
I am the president
of this country.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.022
So that's what Ada meant.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:58.489
He is an enemy of the state.
Kill him!

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.100
<i>Creatures broke through</i>

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.769
<i>the cargo entrance!
They're heading your way!</i>

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.072
<i>Aah!</i>

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.144
Open fire!

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.254
Cease fire. Cease fire.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.288
Help me!

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:49.493
SOLDIER 1 I
Aah!

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.899
Fall back! Aah!

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.851
Did you use it?

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:17.021
Get him.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.761
I'm sorry.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.565
I couldn't stop him.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:43.006
You bastard! Aah!

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.346
Help!

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:35.963
Unh!

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.409
What will you gain
by killing me?

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:44.810
Have you thought
this through?

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:48.506
Who will lead the country
once you gain independence?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.014
You?

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:53.052
I have no intention
of taking advice

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.689
from a pretender to the throne.
Heh.

01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:57.688
In case you're interested,

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.158
all of the elders,
with the exception of Ataman,

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:04.230
have already come over to my side.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:09.230
They all said they would be happy
to renege on independence

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:12.236
once I promised to share
the oil profits with them.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.397
That's not possible.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:17.738
Yes, that's what I thought.

01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:20.211
But I'm afraid it's true.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.247
Shut up! Unh!

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:30.254
While we have been wasting time here,
things have been happening in the world.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.762
We don't have time
to fight amongst ourselves

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.764
in this tiny little country.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.901
Shut up!

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:05.455
Oh, great. It just keeps getting better.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.941
We have to go.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.358
Svetlana!

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:48.965
<i>A biohazard
release has been detected.</i>

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.127
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:57.536
<i>The incineration of the facility
will begin shortly.</i>

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.691
Run!

01:10:59.055 --> 01:11:00.898
Why is it doing that?

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.632
You owe me one.

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:56.952
Why are you helping me?

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:59.525
Don't get all sentimental
on me.

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:02.194
I'm not doing this for you.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.663
There's nobody else left to tell the
world what really happened, that's why.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.738
The hatch!

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:37.827
This will take us up.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.570
Damn it.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:49.733
Hurry.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:56.281
Come on.

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:20.606
Let's get going.

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:38.155
<i>This is an announcement</i>

01:13:38.314 --> 01:13:41.083
<i>from the government
of the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:42.754
We are under attack

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:43.920
<i>by terrorists.</i>

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:45.566
<i>Biochemical weapons</i>

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.098
<i>may have been used.</i>

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:50.601
<i>You are ordered
to evacuate the city immediately.</i>

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.570
<i>Please keep a distance
of five kilometers from the capital.</i>

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.275
Excuse me.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.574
Yes, what is it?

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:04.079
Forces have been
evacuated from the city

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.811
to escape the B.O.W.s
released by the terrorists.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:08.011
However,

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:11.988
it appears the two in the
shelter have managed to escape.

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:16.663
Why are you wasting
my time telling me this?

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.766
Just let the you-know-what
get rid of them.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.959
I'll see to it immediately.

01:14:33.436 --> 01:14:35.143
Help me!

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:08.324
Nice work, pal.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:08.685
Get out of there!

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.261
You really
shouldn't have done that.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.869
You really want to fight this out, huh?

01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:48.887
Sony for butting in.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.534
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.143
Ah, come on. Don't be shy.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.087
NOW!

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.653
This might hurt a little.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.664
I didn't expect to be saved

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:15.433
by B.O.W.s.

01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:33.788
Wanna go grab a few beers?

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.360
Are you buying?

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:41.832
You'll have to go without me.

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:58.511
Can't they find anybody
else to play with?

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:02.686
Why don't you go without me?

01:23:02.845 --> 01:23:04.552
I like the company.

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:11.122
We'd better move a little faster.

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:21.633
<i>Today</i> the capital

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:26.405
<i>was subjected to a powerful attack
launched by terrorists.</i>

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:29.139
<i>They struck with fearsome weapons</i>

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.978
<i>of mass destruction
known as B. O.W.s,</i>

01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:35.520
<i>which have been banned
internationally.</i>

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:40.156
We as a country desire nothing more

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:42.387
than to live in peace.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:46.189
Together with the elders of the
anti-government movement,

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:51.202
who, might I add,
graciously listened to our pleas,

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.341
have managed to avert
the most serious crisis

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.874
in the history of our nation.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:02.081
I believe this is undeniable proof
that as a country,

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:03.682
as a people,

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:08.845
we are suitable for full acceptance
into the international community.

01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:11.250
As leader...

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:16.220
Something wrong?

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.191
I don't need this.

01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:20.265
I'll improvise.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.431
What about the elders?

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.771
It's over. All of them.
A little while ago.

01:24:31.967 --> 01:24:36.211
I suppose I should mention that
during the press conference,

01:24:36.839 --> 01:24:40.810
that the terrorists
executed the elders

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:42.478
as traitors.

01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:44.386
Yes, madam.

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:47.057
Is there anything else?

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.090
I've already contacted
the BSAA and Interpol

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:53.495
with regard to the damage
we sustained because of Ada Wong.

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:57.501
An international warrant for
her arrest will be issued soon.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.573
A few of the terrorists
managed to escape the city,

01:25:00.729 --> 01:25:02.902
but you don't have to
worry about them.

01:25:03.065 --> 01:25:05.011
What about the other two?

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:07.674
It's just a matter of time.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:11.843
Finally, there is no one
left to stop us.

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:14.248
That's right,
Madam President.

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:17.423
Very well, let's start the
press conference immediately.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.752
Yes, of course,
Madam President.

01:25:28.023 --> 01:25:29.593
At last,

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:32.637
a new tomorrow begins.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:01.695
They were keeping an eye
on me the whole time.

01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:10.202
<i>On air in five, four, three...</i>

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.762
Good evening. I am President--

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:15.533
Madam President.

01:27:16.198 --> 01:27:18.474
We're under attack
by the Americans and Russians.

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:21.045
What? It can't be.

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:51.504
Stay down,
you dogs.

01:27:51.667 --> 01:27:53.044
Stay still.

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:55.109
Move. Keep them away.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.045
Move! Move!

01:27:57.473 --> 01:28:00.181
- Hands in the air!
- Help me.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.572
So...

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:24.308
The Americans and Russians
had us in the palms of their hands

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:26.104
from the beginning.

01:28:27.369 --> 01:28:29.315
That's what it looks like.

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:31.880
Did you know about this?

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:34.886
No.

01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:38.787
If I did, I'd still be enjoying
my vacation.

01:28:43.585 --> 01:28:44.893
He?!

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.650
I've lost everything.

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.525
My mentor,

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.426
my friends.

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:29.332
I have nothing left to fight for.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.509
Kill me.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.376
Please.

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:43.950
I don't want to change
into one of those monsters.

01:30:05.601 --> 01:30:06.875
Well...

01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:09.772
I guess there is no other choice.

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.828
I'd feel the same way if I was you.

01:30:35.397 --> 01:30:38.776
But the option of taking our own
lives no longer belongs to us.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:47.750
Once we start using these, we owe it
to the people who died alongside us.

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.014
We have to continue living.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:02.030
Even if it means living the rest of our
lives without the use of our limbs.

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:11.042
That is my answer

01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:13.610
and your answer...

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.013
Buddy.

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:33.031
<i>It's been three days
since the end of the civil war</i>

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:35.566
<i>that tore through
the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:37.202
<i>The fierce battles</i>

01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:41.671
<i>were halted thanks to the intervention
of American and Russian troops.</i>

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.400
<i>Today marks the first day</i>

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:46.409
<i>in which the world's media
has access to the city.</i>

01:31:46.568 --> 01:31:49.572
<i>A temporary government
headed by the U. S. and Russia</i>

01:31:49.771 --> 01:31:53.651
<i>will be set up in the Eastern
Slav Republic to maintain peace.</i>

01:31:53.809 --> 01:31:57.188
Svetlana Belikova has resigned
from her presidency

01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.690
<i>and companies that supported her
and the former government</i>

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.693
<i>will be thrown out of the country
and dismantled.</i>

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.197
Top brass knew about it right
from the beginning, didn't they?

01:32:12.661 --> 01:32:14.937
The report from
Scarecrow tipped them off

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:17.940
that Svetlana was in
possession of B.O.W.s.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.175
That's why they pulled out
in a panic

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:23.248
and ran like hell to join forces
with the Russians.

01:32:24.339 --> 01:32:26.876
To protect themselves, right?

01:32:27.342 --> 01:32:28.719
You're mistaken.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:31.380
The president had nothing
to do with this.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:35.551
Not even we knew what was going on.
You have to believe me.

01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:39.796
Leon.

01:32:39.955 --> 01:32:43.232
I'm not going anywhere
Don't--

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:50.837
In the end, nothing's really changed.

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:12.394
<i>Everything went according to plan.</i>

01:33:12.554 --> 01:33:14.556
<i>The facility has been destroyed</i>

01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:17.363
<i>and I salvaged
the cultivated Plaga.</i>

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:21.168
<i>But I haven't decided</i>

01:33:21.363 --> 01:33:23.809
<i>whether or not
I should send it to you.</i>

01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:29.646
<i>Really?</i>

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:33.115
<i>Thank you. That's very kind.</i>

01:33:33.408 --> 01:33:35.979
<i>Although, I sort of liked the idea</i>

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:40.092
<i>of adding an international
arrest warrant to my profile.</i>

01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:22.962
What are you doing?

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:26.996
- You're going to get in trouble.
- Did you do yours?

01:34:31.533 --> 01:34:33.012
- Morning.
- Hi.

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:35.876
Good morning.
- Morning.

01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:52.660
Oh, come on, let's
go, we're gonna be late.

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:57.594
Morning.
