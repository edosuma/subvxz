nojob history.

- Fine?

There are people who come
here from all over the world.

They don't have waterfront

There are pleasant parts of Afghanistan.
The mountains are nice.

Maybe we can vacation there
someday.

it's my birthday in a few days.

to reviewyourstatus?

02:02.589 --> 02:04.580
That's deskjockeyjargon
forwhat now?

- Briefcase down. Briefcase down.
- Well, look at him, Michael.

He's a cubicle monkey.

[ Michael Narrating] Calling the cops
on someone can teachyou a lot.

02:31.851 --> 02:35.719
A foreign agent would run,
so might an armed assassin.

to act like a bureaucrat.

[ Clark On Phone ] I have been more
than patient, Mr. Westen.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.017
I was willing to meetyou in a public park,
as you requested...

I hope I don't have to remind
you that my recommendation...

carries weight when it comes to
removing you from this blacklist.

Bureaucrats live forrespect.

03:45.992 --> 03:48.790
East ofthe Balkans,
that means a bribe.

03:48.861 --> 03:52.160
In the West, it's more about showing
you know they're in charge.

And I expect a I ittle more
consideration for my time.

I talked with the man on the phone
who burned me recently.

04:03.042 --> 04:05.033
He seemed unhappy.

a verdict on me.

And they thinkyou have that
kind of money?

07:22.308 --> 07:25.072
Well, the-- th-the thing
about this job...

07:25.144 --> 07:29.205
is thatyou drive these cars
and you stay in these houses...

07:29.282 --> 07:32.376

thatyou own them,you know?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.250

thatyou own these things.

- Yes, we will be there.

Working with untrained amateurs

Yes. All the way...

11:30.623 --> 11:33.717
from the escalators to that
charming little lingerie store.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.227
They have a fabulous little teddy in there.
Make a great gift.

11:36.295 --> 11:39.162
I've never seen you wear
anything but men's shirts to bed.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.222
Fair enough.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.792
There a men's store on the third floor.
Nice selection.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.567
The ones with the big buttons
are easier to undo.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.337
Focus, Fi. Can you see people
on my side ofthe mall?

11:51.410 --> 11:55.278

Once a kidnapperknows you're onto him...

he'll try to contact his partners to have

I'm not saying I'm happywith how things
went down today either...

14:22.294 --> 14:24.558
but this can still
work out.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.894
- In some ways, we're better off.
- How?

14:26.966 --> 14:29.764
How are we better off, dude?
You got some kidnapper tied up someplace.

14:29.835 --> 14:33.236
You got Dawn--

Oh, wait.
Oh, I get it.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.602
- You're gonna trade Dawn for the dude.
- No.

He's just a hired hand.
Ifthey find out we've got their guy...

14:42.748 --> 14:46.514
- they'll kill her immediately, probably leave town.
- So how are we better off?

14:46.585 --> 14:49.748
- Theywant five million dollars
or they kill Dawn, yes?
- Right.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.017
- Last I checked, we don't
have five million dollars. Right?
- No.

14:52.091 --> 14:56.460
So our only hope is to find Dawn before they
find out we don't have five million dollars.

14:56.528 --> 15:00.487
We will convince this guy
to help us find Dawn.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.103

[Michael Narrating] The art ofturning
someone into a double agent is delicate.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.545
The target has to be put into
a fragile psychological state.

15:17.616 --> 15:18.117
Get this crazy bitch
away from me!

15:18.117 --> 15:19.516
Get this crazy bitch
away from me!

F.ortunately, fragile psychological states
are a specialty ofF.iona's.

I was just helping our friend Lucio
into a more cooperative mood.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.120

- Had to get some air.

loud in here.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.393
So what do we know
about ournewfriend?

15:35.467 --> 15:37.628
Well, his name is
Lucio Velasquez.

15:37.703 --> 15:41.099
Colombian national.
He has got a rap sheet here and at home.

15:41.232 --> 15:44.030
He and his brother ran an
extortion racket in Colombia.

15:44.102 --> 15:47.731
- His brothergot caught, Lucio ran.
- Good to meet you, Lucio.

15:47.805 --> 15:50.467

Go ahead and Taser me all you want.

15:50.541 --> 15:52.532
- I'm not gonna tellyou nothin'.
- Taser? Oh, no.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.545

than a Taser. We've got an instant camera.

15:55.613 --> 15:57.547
[ Laughing ]

15:57.615 --> 16:01.517
It's always easier to turn someone who works
for a criminal gang into a double agent.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.647
The more secretive and ruthless
their side is, the better.

16:05.723 --> 16:09.989
You work on their fear that any hint of
disloyalty will get them killed by their own people.

16:10.061 --> 16:12.825
Lucio, you need to thi nk about
your situation very carefully.

16:12.897 --> 16:17.334
You have been caught in the
middle ofa delicate assignment.

16:17.401 --> 16:20.996
Say we let you go and give this
photo to your boss--

16:22.406 --> 16:24.533
Along with a cooperating
witness statement...

16:24.609 --> 16:26.907
- you're about to give to the F.B.I.
- No, no, no, no.

16:26.978 --> 16:29.674
- I never made no statement.
- Here's the form.

16:29.747 --> 16:32.682
Looks real, huh? We'll fill it out,
sign it on your behalf.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.344
- Sam's good with the computer.
- Thanks, Mike. It's just Photoshop.

16:35.419 --> 16:38.786
Oh, look here.
You have a summons.

16:38.856 --> 16:43.054
It means you're going to testify
in court againstyour boss.

16:45.096 --> 16:48.065

So anyway...

16:48.132 --> 16:50.293
we take the photo,
we put it in the file.

16:50.368 --> 16:53.599

and other government agencies...

16:53.671 --> 16:56.435
just in caseyour boss
does his homework.

16:58.276 --> 17:00.642
I have to say, you guys look
pretty tight here.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.751
My guess is he won't feel right
until you're dead.

17:12.056 --> 17:14.580
- What doyou want, man?
- You now work for us, Lucio.

17:14.659 --> 17:18.151
You tell us what we want to know
and you do what we say...

17:18.229 --> 17:20.288

you will stay alive.

17:20.364 --> 17:23.891
- Where's Dawn?
- I don't know.

17:23.968 --> 17:26.128
- You don't know, Lucio?
- No, no, no. I swear.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.137

- Reyes,yourboss.

17:33.311 --> 17:36.803

17:36.881 --> 17:39.179

with two other guys.

Someone else guards the hostages.
Everything is separate.

17:41.652 --> 17:44.086

He does that for security.

-Just please try not to scratch that car.

18:22.093 --> 18:22.821
- Yeah.
-Just please try not to scratch that car.

18:22.893 --> 18:26.192
It's an S550 A.M.G. worth,

18:26.264 --> 18:28.664
And we need a house.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.531
There a penthouse downtown that I watch.
What doyou need it for?

18:31.602 --> 18:35.129
We need to find where Dawn is being kept.
Lucio doesn't know.

18:35.206 --> 18:37.231
His job is just finding targets
for Reyes...

18:37.308 --> 18:39.299
so we're gonna have Lucio bring him
a new target--

18:39.377 --> 18:42.107
- a rich societywife.
- Enchanté.

18:42.179 --> 18:44.238
- And a disgruntled bodyguard.
- Ya bitch.

18:44.315 --> 18:47.409
Talk to Reyes, tell him I'm willing
to help him pull the job.

18:47.485 --> 18:49.510
But he's gotta show me
where he keeps the hostages.

18:49.587 --> 18:54.024
Hopefully, they'll bring Sam
to where Dawn is and we can grab her.

18:54.091 --> 18:58.221
But we gotta move fast. And we need
a target that will make him drool.

is a corrupt employee.

Good work, Lucio.

19:29.026 --> 19:31.187

An employee can handle alarms, police.

19:31.262 --> 19:34.322
You can get financial
information, bank accounts.

19:34.398 --> 19:38.061
You've even got a fall guy
ifanything goes wrong.

19:38.135 --> 19:42.231
To a professional kidnapper,
a good man on the inside is worth a lot.

19:45.276 --> 19:48.871
And a bad man on the inside
is worth even more.

19:55.953 --> 19:58.217
- Lucio.
- Okay, okay. I can't do this.

19:58.289 --> 20:00.917
Okay, man, I can't.
Reyes is gonna kill me if he finds out.

20:00.991 --> 20:05.587
Well, that's the point, Lucio. You do yourjob
well, he won't find out and you'll stay alive.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.996
- [ Sighs ]
- Did Reyes like our little business opportunity?

20:09.066 --> 20:11.261
The rich lady and the bodyguard?
Yeah. Uh, he loved it.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.326
Okay, we've been following
'em around all day.

20:13.404 --> 20:15.599
- He wants to meet with your guy, talk terms.
- What about Dawn?

20:15.673 --> 20:17.800
He's impatient. Look,
the guywants his money.

20:17.875 --> 20:21.276
I held him off a little bit, but-but I-I don't
know ifl can do it much longer.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.542
[ Chuckles ]
I'm supposed to be calling you
right now and telling you...

20:24.615 --> 20:26.640
thatyou only got 1 2 hours
or the girl's dead.

20:28.819 --> 20:31.413
Tell him 1 2 hours
isn't long enough.

20:31.489 --> 20:34.856
Tell him Nick's family has
hired a hostage negotiator...

20:34.925 --> 20:36.950
and that the guywants
to talk to him in person.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.962
With Reyes? No, no. Come on.
You can't be serious.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.590
You convince him it's the best
way for him to get his money.

20:42.666 --> 20:48.229
We just need to buy enough time
to find Dawn and then you're done, Lucio.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.103
- You'll do it?
- Do I got a choice?

20:51.175 --> 20:54.008
No, you don't. You got my number.
Tell me where and when.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.875
[Michael Narrating]
The thing about doubling anyone...

20:55.946 --> 20:59.006
is that the more they do
foryou, the deeper theyget.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.779
The deeper they get,
the more you can make them do.

21:01.852 --> 21:04.480
Great ifyou're running them,
but hard on the source.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.956

average.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.721
I understand your concerns,
Mr. Westen.

21:14.799 --> 21:18.291
I have worked with field
operatives before.

21:18.369 --> 21:20.963
I may find your priorities
somewhat baroque and unnecessary...

21:21.038 --> 21:23.233
but I suppose that's
why I work in an office...

21:23.307 --> 21:25.741
and you run around
the world with guns.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.744
I suppose so, yes.

21:27.812 --> 21:32.806
So, you've now had your opportunity
to screen me in public.

21:32.883 --> 21:37.411
Are you satisfied that I'm not some
shadow figure sent to liquidateyou?

21:37.488 --> 21:39.479
- Can we do our business now?
- Yes.

21:39.557 --> 21:43.220
Now, I have security
concerns of my own.

21:43.294 --> 21:46.058
As I'm sureyou're aware,
your case has certain issues...

21:46.130 --> 21:48.894
pertaining to
national security.

21:48.966 --> 21:52.561
Uh, issues that require
a private venue.

21:52.636 --> 21:55.434
Now my office in Fort
Lauderdale is more--

21:55.506 --> 21:58.771
I would not be able to make it up there
for at least a few days.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.878
That's unfortunate.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.211
Maybe this isn't important enough toyou,
Mr. Westen. I have to get back to D.C.

22:05.282 --> 22:09.184
You could come by my place
the night after tomorrow.

22:09.253 --> 22:12.484
You hope to gain some sort
ofhome court advantage?

22:12.556 --> 22:17.050
No, it's just that I need to be around here
for the next few days for my dayjob.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.595

Andrew Chambers, hostage
negotiator for the family.

Okay, you got a sniper trained
on you, Mr. Chambers.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.753
Tell me why
I shouldn't kill you?

22:51.829 --> 22:55.128
Nick's family's not gonna pay
ifyou shoot the negotiator.

22:55.199 --> 22:58.259
-You'd end up with nothing foryour trouble.
-How do I knowyou're not a cop?

22:58.335 --> 23:01.862
Cops don't make themselves

- It comes down to howmuch we're
willing to move on the price.

Now it's your turn.

37:08.413 --> 37:12.315
- Uh, those surfboards right there--
- Yeah, I don't surf.

37:12.384 --> 37:15.353
Okay. You're awesome, bro.

37:15.420 --> 37:18.150
- [ Horn Honking]
- Sounds like they're here.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.785
All set, Mike. Hospital checked
her out. She's fine.

37:25.864 --> 37:27.889
- Is Nick here?
- He's inside.

37:27.966 --> 37:29.900
- You guys should talk.
- Okay.

37:31.770 --> 37:33.795
- Cakewalk, huh?
- Aw.

37:33.872 --> 37:37.865
- Look, Mike, ifyou everwant
to borrow my Caddy, uh, it's yours.
- Thanks.

37:37.942 --> 37:39.967
- Nick.
- Hey, babe.

37:40.045 --> 37:42.513
[ Grunts ]
You lied to me!

37:42.580 --> 37:44.605
- Baby, I love you.
- You lied to me!

37:48.186 --> 37:50.279
Another happy ending.

37:52.157 --> 37:54.091
Mr. Clark.

37:54.159 --> 37:57.094
I've never done a meeting in a private home
like this before, Mr. Westen.

37:57.162 --> 37:59.756
- Uh, I'm not even sure it's allowed.
- Thanks for bending the rules.

37:59.831 --> 38:02.026
Yeah, again, no guarantees,
Mr. Westen.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.034
Uh, we're gonna have
to cut this short.

38:04.102 --> 38:07.469
- You tell meyour side ofthe story,
I'll get back toyou.
- It shouldn't take long.

38:07.539 --> 38:10.565
- Good. Mywife's expecting me
to actually make my flight tonight.
- Great.

38:10.809 --> 38:15.439
[ Sighs ]
You have any coffee?

38:15.513 --> 38:18.414
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

38:18.483 --> 38:22.817
- I think I have some instant.
- That's fine.

38:22.887 --> 38:24.718
[Michael Narrating]
The longeryou've been in the game...

38:24.789 --> 38:28.020
the moreyou have to be careful
about underestimating an opponent.

38:28.093 --> 38:31.324
Sayyou don't think much ofbureaucrats,
don't feel they're worth your time or attention--

38:31.396 --> 38:33.864
[ Grunti ng ]

38:33.932 --> 38:38.062
Then a bureaucrat is the perfect
person to send to killyou.

38:38.136 --> 38:40.502
[ Grunti ng ]

38:45.276 --> 38:48.575
- Wow, you're pretty good.
- Let go.

38:48.646 --> 38:50.807
- I t'll be less painful foryou.
- [ Gasps ]

38:50.882 --> 38:53.874
It'll look like you
hanged yourself.

38:53.952 --> 38:56.386
No surprise, really.

38:56.454 --> 38:59.252
- No work, no money.
- [ Grunts ]

39:01.960 --> 39:06.192
This would have been easier ifyou'd
kept our appointment in Fort Lauderdale.

39:06.264 --> 39:09.461
I had some things arranged.
Oh, well.

39:09.534 --> 39:12.526
[Michael Narrating] There's
no wayto anticipate everydanger.

39:12.604 --> 39:16.301
You need a backup plan
forwhen things go wrong.

39:16.374 --> 39:20.970
[ Gasping ]
Sorry to inconvenience you.

39:21.045 --> 39:24.071
That's why home court advantage
is so important.

39:24.149 --> 39:27.915
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Gunshot ]

39:27.986 --> 39:31.945
[ Gasping, Coughing ]

39:49.174 --> 39:51.642
[ Gasps, Groans ]

39:58.516 --> 40:00.984
[ Sam ] Mike, the cops foundyour assassin
in an alley this morning.

40:01.052 --> 40:04.419
He bled to death.
No I.D. on him.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.557
His fingerprints didn't show up
in anygovernment database.

40:05.557 --> 40:07.752
His fingerprints didn't show up
in anygovernment database.

40:07.826 --> 40:09.760
So, officially, I guess the guy
never existed.

40:09.828 --> 40:12.160
Must have been impersonating
the real Perry Clark.

40:12.230 --> 40:16.098
- You thi nk that the guy who burned you sent him?
- Not a bad guess. Thanks, Sam.

40:17.535 --> 40:19.594
You were right about him,
you know?

40:19.671 --> 40:21.798
You must feel a little proud
ofyourself?

40:21.873 --> 40:26.435
I wanted my burn notice resolved,
talked myselfinto denying my instincts.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.309
That's nothing to be proud of.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.541
- I'm fine, Fi.
- You almost died.

40:31.616 --> 40:33.550
That's happened before.

40:34.752 --> 40:38.017
So I'm not allowed to be
concerned, to worry?

40:38.089 --> 40:40.319
You can worry about me.

40:40.391 --> 40:44.225
- Like Nickworried about Dawn?
- Hopefully, not exactly like that.

40:44.295 --> 40:46.320
Oh, he was head
over heels in love.

40:49.801 --> 40:53.532
I talked to him about you, about what
I should getyou foryour birthday.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.235
- A Makarov.
- He said you would like it.

41:05.783 --> 41:07.717
Is it the same?

41:07.785 --> 41:10.845
Nick convinced his boss
to sell it to me at a discount.

41:12.991 --> 41:15.687
Thankyou, Michael.

41:16.895 --> 41:19.659
Happy birthday, Fi.
