00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.767
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.800 --> 00:40.533
in a court of law.

00:42.267 --> 00:46.700
-Law enforcement has evolved
immensely since I started
way back in 1991.

00:46.733 --> 00:50.433
When I started here, we operated
off of one radio channel,

00:50.467 --> 00:53.667
and now we have upwards
to 20-plus channels.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.633
Um, back when I started,
we had to check out
our portable radios,

00:57.667 --> 00:59.333
and sometimes
you'd start a shift

00:59.367 --> 01:03.067
uh, without a portable radio
available to you, so you
had to make sure

01:03.100 --> 01:04.633
that you got
to the shift briefing early

01:04.667 --> 01:06.900
to get a handy talky.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.767
I got this guy leavin'
a known drug house.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.400
He's ridin' his bike
with no light on.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.300
Hey, stop right there, brother.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.300
-What's up?
-Hey, keep your hands out.
What are you doin'?

01:18.333 --> 01:19.667
-Who?
-You.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.167
-What are you doin'?
-I ain't doin' nothin',

01:21.200 --> 01:22.233
what are you talkin'
about, man?

01:22.267 --> 01:23.367
-All right, now.
Don't be reachin'

01:23.400 --> 01:24.533
when I get outta the car...

01:24.567 --> 01:25.900
-Who's reachin'
for somethin'?
-You.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.300
You got a knife right here.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.700
-That's my knife!
-Okay, you don't be
reachin' for it

01:29.733 --> 01:32.067
when I pull you over,
what's wrong with you?
-I wasn't reachin' for it,

01:32.067 --> 01:34.233
I wasn't
reachin' for it, player.
-You got ID?

01:34.267 --> 01:35.467
-Yeah.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.167
I don't why you say
I was reachin' for it. (laughs)

01:41.200 --> 01:42.933
-Huh?
-I don't know why you say
I was reachin' for it,

01:42.967 --> 01:45.667
that's crazy.
-Chill-- Chill out
for a minute.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.067
-Got it right here, man.
-Keep your hands
out of your pockets, all right?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.467
-Damn.
-Keep your hands
in your pockets.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.633
Bring your hands back here.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.267
-What the hell is that--
What the-- what's that--

01:53.300 --> 01:55.667
-I said bring your hands
back to the back.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.133
-What is you--
What is you doin'?

01:57.167 --> 01:59.333
-Because I'm gonna handcuff you.
-For what?

01:59.367 --> 02:01.300
What is you handcuffin' me for?

02:01.333 --> 02:04.833
That's against the law!
That's against the law, officer.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.300
Officer, that's against the law.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.400
That's against the law, officer.

02:07.433 --> 02:08.767
That's
against the law, officer.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.433
Lemme talk!
Lemme talk!
Lemme talk!

02:10.467 --> 02:11.567
Lemme talk!

02:13.067 --> 02:14.833
That's against the law!

02:14.867 --> 02:16.167
That's against the law!

02:16.200 --> 02:18.067
That's against the law!

02:18.100 --> 02:20.167
That's against the law!

02:20.200 --> 02:21.833
-(indistinct)

02:21.867 --> 02:23.433
-6-3-4, I got one on the ground.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.767
Northbound, 1400 block, Maple.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.067
-(radio chatter)

02:32.100 --> 02:37.067
-Black male, no shirt,
blue shorts, northbound
13th and Brook.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.167
Get on the ground!

02:38.200 --> 02:41.533
-(radio chatter)

02:41.567 --> 02:43.467
-Get on the ground.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.300
-Kevin!
-Get on the ground now.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.267
Get on the ground now!

02:48.300 --> 02:50.067
Get on the ground!

02:50.067 --> 02:55.100
-Kevin!
-Put your hands
behind your back.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.467
-Kevin!
-Put your hands
behind your back!

02:57.500 --> 02:59.133
Do it now.

02:59.167 --> 03:01.300
Do it now!

03:01.333 --> 03:04.200
-Man...
-Put your hands
behind your back.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.100
-You just... sprayed that
when there was no reason.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.967
-What's goin' on?

03:12.067 --> 03:15.667
-Oh! Hey!
-You stay inside!

03:15.700 --> 03:17.567
-What's goin' on?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.467
-Hey, man?

03:21.500 --> 03:25.300
-Put your hands
behind your back.
-Arrestin' me for no reason?

03:25.333 --> 03:28.067
-(indistinct) he gave me
a bag of weed.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.267
(indistinct) bag of weed.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.333
-East 13.
-You all right, Trace?

03:31.367 --> 03:33.367
-Yeah.
I just got a mouthful of spray.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.500
-(indistinct)
teary or somethin'.

03:35.533 --> 03:38.800
-(indistinct)
-Uh, I need to pat him down
real fast.

03:38.833 --> 03:41.067
He had a knife on him.
I took the knife away from him.

03:41.067 --> 03:43.333
-I got his knife here, Tracy.

03:43.367 --> 03:44.767
-All right.
Put your leg up.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.733
Right here.
Stand him up.

03:46.767 --> 03:49.433
-Where you at, Tracy?
-I'm over in the 1400 block
and Maple.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.933
-Can I get some water
for my eyes real quick?

03:50.967 --> 03:52.633
-We got an ambulance comin'.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.667
-(bleep) I'll settle
for water, man.
-I think I got everything

03:54.700 --> 03:58.367
out of him, you got
the other stuff, I got
his knife, rings, keys,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.067
and vodka.
-(groans)

04:01.067 --> 04:02.433
-What'd you do with the drugs?

04:02.467 --> 04:04.067
Toss 'em?
-No... no, they didn't
have no (indistinct).

04:04.100 --> 04:05.567
-Huh?
-They didn't
have no (indistinct).

04:05.600 --> 04:08.433
-Didn't have any?
-Oww! Oh...

04:08.467 --> 04:10.233
-Have a seat in there.
-It burns!

04:10.267 --> 04:12.067
-We got medics comin'
to take care of you.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.233
-Ahh...

04:15.067 --> 04:16.600
-What is goin' on tonight?

04:16.633 --> 04:19.067
-I was gonna buy a bag
of (indistinct) and uh...

04:19.067 --> 04:22.367
I'm cool. (moans)
-Why didn't you just
play with the program?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.867
-I thought (bleep).
-What do you mean?

04:24.900 --> 04:28.133
-Because I didn't do nothin'...
-Yeah, you're ridin' a bike
with no lights on, man.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.500
-I never had that.
-You're just leavin'
a drug house.

04:30.533 --> 04:33.267
-I-- I-- I--
I nev-- I didn't know that.

04:33.300 --> 04:36.833
I mean-- Uhh! I didn't know
it was a crime.

04:36.867 --> 04:37.967
-You didn't know
what was a crime,

04:38.067 --> 04:39.267
buyin' drugs?
-No...

04:39.300 --> 04:41.567
-Or ridin' your bike
without a light?
-Yeah.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.567
-Yeah.
Well, we normally don't stop you
unless we have a legal right

04:44.600 --> 04:48.633
to do so, right?
Okay. And I tried to explain
that to you,

04:48.667 --> 04:51.267
but you kept reachin' around,
reachin' around, and you
had knives on you.

04:51.300 --> 04:55.067
-No, I wouldn't--
I ain't never-- I ain't never
attempted to stab or hurt...

04:55.067 --> 04:56.667
-Okay.
-an officer.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.200
-You know what?
And I'm not gonna be
the first, okay?

04:59.233 --> 05:01.400
-No, I-- I--
-That's why I'm goin' home
at the end of the night,

05:01.433 --> 05:02.767
all right?
And why'd you hit me?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.667
-I didn't hit you.
-Yeah, you did.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.867
-Officer, I didn't hit you,
I was just tryin' to get away
from you.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.233
-You hit me
to get away. Okay?

05:08.267 --> 05:10.067
No, y-- well, you grabbed me,
I didn't have no idea,

05:10.067 --> 05:12.900
so now I'm like, wow,
I'm thinkin' you tryin'
to kill me, and I'm like,

05:12.933 --> 05:16.067
okay, maybe I'll play along
with it and just run.

05:16.100 --> 05:19.533
I'm all (bleep) up (indistinct),
I'm sorry, but no, I wasn't
tryin' to hit you.

05:19.567 --> 05:23.467
I-- I didn't-- I wasn't tryin'
to hit you and-- and--
or come at you

05:23.500 --> 05:25.067
in no kinda way, sir.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.300
-Okay.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.533
Um, he ran out of his shoes
it looks like, here.

05:29.567 --> 05:33.367
We're just kinda
lookin' around to see
what he might've discarded.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.633
-(radio chatter)
-Here it is, right here.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.600
Maybe?
-Yep, there it is.

05:42.667 --> 05:46.333
So, looks like we've got
some white powder.

05:46.367 --> 05:47.700
Um...

05:51.200 --> 05:54.533
We got some, uh,
looks like pills...

05:54.567 --> 05:57.400
uh, probably some type
of opiates.

05:57.433 --> 06:00.300
And then we got a small bag
of green vegetation,

06:00.333 --> 06:04.200
which appears to be marijuana.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.700
Hey, Maurice?

06:09.733 --> 06:10.733
How you doin', bud?

06:10.767 --> 06:11.833
Doin' all right?

06:11.867 --> 06:14.800
All right.
Feelin' good?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.200
All right.
Hey, we-- we retraced
your steps there

06:17.233 --> 06:20.733
and um-- is this
just all you had
right here?

06:20.767 --> 06:23.700
Just this little bit and this?
And the pills?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.100
-(loud breath)
-That-- That's it?

06:25.133 --> 06:27.367
-Yeah.
No...

06:27.400 --> 06:29.267
-Why would you run
over somethin' so small?

06:29.300 --> 06:30.800
Is this really worth it?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.167
What we had
to go through tonight?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.067
-I mean-- I mean--
I was-- I was high as hell,

06:34.100 --> 06:36.067
comin' out the house
from just gettin' a hit

06:36.100 --> 06:37.667
off the goddamn meth,
you know what I'm sayin'?

06:37.700 --> 06:40.500
-Right...
-And so... I was just
tryin' to get away from you.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.967
I just thought it was
just all wrong, man.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.633
-What-- What are the--
what's the pills?

06:45.667 --> 06:46.700
-Oh--
-What kind are they?

06:46.733 --> 06:48.067
-Oh, downer.
-What?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.867
-Make me go night-night.
-Valium?

06:49.900 --> 06:51.100
-Yeah.
-Valium? Okay.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.900
-Make me go night-night.
-Is the Valium and weed is it?

06:52.933 --> 06:55.167
-Yes, I-- I smoked that meth,
and I smoked that meth,

06:55.200 --> 06:57.967
and I just hit that meth,
come out the garage,

06:58.067 --> 06:59.633
then I bought the pills
so I can go to sleep.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.500
-All right, so you're gonna
be charged tonight
for possession,

07:02.533 --> 07:04.633
battery LEO
and resist arrest.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.900
-I like workin' patrol
for a variety of reasons.

07:09.933 --> 07:13.333
But the thing that I like
the most is being able
to come out

07:13.367 --> 07:16.567
and catch the bad guys.
That's really what the job
is about.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.533
And when you do something good
for the community,

07:19.567 --> 07:21.533
um, that's job well done,

07:21.567 --> 07:23.500
you go home feelin' good
at the end of the night.

07:25.167 --> 07:28.100
I spotted a suspicious car
parked around the corner here

07:28.133 --> 07:32.067
at this park.
Um, it's-- This park
is closed at night,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.833
and it's known to me
for some drug activity,

07:34.867 --> 07:36.367
so I'm just gonna
go over here

07:36.400 --> 07:39.067
and make contact
with the occupants
of the car,

07:39.100 --> 07:40.433
just to see
what they're up to.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.567
Two Adam six eight,
suspicious vehicle.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.400
Hi, guys are you?
-Good, how are you, sir?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.067
-Good, I'm just seein'

07:57.067 --> 07:58.633
-Oh, no, we were just--
-We're just parked here,

07:58.667 --> 08:00.133
just waiting
for my friend Kevin.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.333
-Okay.
Do you guys have a couple IDs
I can just check on you

08:02.367 --> 08:04.233

-Don't-- Are we doin'
somethin' wrong, or--?

08:04.267 --> 08:07.633
-Well, this-- the-- the park
closes right at dusk, and that's
what it is now.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.400
-Ohh...
-But there's also--

08:12.133 --> 08:15.900
so I come-- I come by

08:17.967 --> 08:20.633
Okay.
-Oh, (indistinct).

08:20.667 --> 08:22.833
-(laughs)
-Okay. Come on out here.
Just keep your hands

08:22.867 --> 08:24.933
where I can see 'em.
I see the dope pipe
in your hand, dude.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.833
Or in your pocket.
Okay, turn around.

08:26.867 --> 08:28.467
Put your hands
behind your back.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.900
I see it's--

08:29.933 --> 08:33.267

08:33.300 --> 08:35.333
-Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay! Okay!

08:35.367 --> 08:37.467

08:41.100 --> 08:42.767
Sorry. Sorry.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.800
I'm sorry, you don't
have to knee me in my head.
-For a dope pipe, dude?

08:45.833 --> 08:49.867
-For a dope pipe, yeah,
I'm a (indistinct),
sorry... man.

08:51.767 --> 08:55.367
Sorry about that.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm really,
really sorry, okay?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.300
Ohh...

08:57.333 --> 08:58.467
-Spread your feet.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.533
-(bleep)

09:02.200 --> 09:04.800
-All for that little thing?
-Yeah.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.067
-Where's the dope at, man?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.200
-It's in there,
it's right there.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.600
-Okay.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.233
Come over here,
I'm gonna sit you down.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.100
Go and have a seat.

09:15.133 --> 09:16.533
Come over here.

09:19.833 --> 09:21.867
-How do you know him?
-He's my boyfriend.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.900
-Of how long?
-Six years.

09:23.933 --> 09:25.233
-Six years?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.267
Do you guys
have any kids together,

09:28.300 --> 09:29.800
or do you have kids
or anything like that?
-No.

09:29.833 --> 09:33.833
-You have no kids?
-I have kids, not with me,
um... not around him,

09:33.867 --> 09:35.833
you know what I mean?
-Where are your kids at?

09:35.867 --> 09:39.367
-Um, one lives with my dad.
He has got full custody
of her, and the other one's

09:39.400 --> 09:40.800
with her dad.

09:40.833 --> 09:43.900
-All right.
Just come back over here
and have a seat.

09:46.067 --> 09:48.100
Just sit down right there, okay?

09:48.133 --> 09:50.467
What's
in the cigarette pack, man?

09:50.500 --> 09:51.733
-A little bit of heroin.

09:51.767 --> 09:52.900
-Heroin?

09:54.067 --> 09:56.067
So you use both meth
and heroin?

09:56.067 --> 09:58.167
-Yes.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.300
-It looks to me
like some black tar heroin
right there.

10:03.867 --> 10:07.600
So, as of now,
this is going to be possession
of both methamphetamine

10:07.633 --> 10:10.667
and heroin.
So I'm gonna go ahead
and search the car,

10:10.700 --> 10:12.733
see if I can find
anything else inside.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.567
-There's a-- a blue, like,
a satchel bag
in the back seat.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.400
-Okay.
-And I have another bag
of-- of meth in there.

10:18.433 --> 10:19.900
-It's in the bag?
-It's in the bag.

10:19.933 --> 10:22.000
-Okay.
-I just didn't want you
to find it and then be mad

10:22.033 --> 10:24.167
that I was trying to...
-All right.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.567
Well, thanks for bein' honest.

10:31.433 --> 10:35.800
So he said there's gonna
be... methamphetamine
in here,

10:35.833 --> 10:39.367
so I'll pull this out,
and we'll search
that outside.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.133
Okay...

10:44.267 --> 10:46.200
Little baggie of a white
crystallized substance,

10:46.233 --> 10:48.333
which is gonna be
methamphetamine,

10:48.367 --> 10:51.767
that's what he said it is,
and that's what I recognize it
as, too.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.867
Are you a convicted felon?

10:53.900 --> 10:55.500
For what?
-Auto theft,

10:55.533 --> 10:58.733
and uh, eluding,
and uh, possession.

10:58.767 --> 11:01.433
-Possession.
-Those are my first--
Those are my first felonies,

11:01.467 --> 11:04.233
and then I, uh, got
another felony for possession
of a firearm.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.667
(indistinct) after that.
-Okay.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.967
-All--
All the standard stuff...

11:09.067 --> 11:12.067
kinda deal.
-Standard-- I don't know
what standard is... (laughs)

11:12.067 --> 11:14.400
-Well, the stuff that I see
grouped together
most commonly,

11:14.433 --> 11:16.067
you know what I mean?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.767
Drugs, stolen cars,
eluding, guns...

11:18.800 --> 11:20.500
they kind of all
group together.

11:20.533 --> 11:24.933
-Have-- Haven't been in trouble
for the last six years,
so I mean...

11:24.967 --> 11:27.233
if that counts for anything.
-Six, seven years?

11:27.267 --> 11:28.600
Six years.

11:28.633 --> 11:31.400
-I'm just gonna stick you
in the car just for a second.

11:31.433 --> 11:32.433
Okay, man.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.200
Do you have any kids?

11:37.233 --> 11:39.400
-Yes, sir.
-You do?

11:39.433 --> 11:42.800
How old are they?
Eighteen, 16, and two
eight-year-olds.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.100
You have four kids?

11:44.133 --> 11:47.933
Okay.
Go ahead and have a seat
in the car for me, Gabe.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.133
-Yeah, thank you.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.200
-All right.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.600
Hang tight, Gabe.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.933
Okay, what
was goin' on, Melissa?

11:56.967 --> 12:00.400
-I don't love who he is
now, but I mean, we've
been together for six years,

12:00.433 --> 12:03.533
and I love who he used to be.
I don't think he's ever
coming back, though.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.667
-But you know that he's
doing stuff that's
holding you back.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.967
-I know, I do know.
-You know addicts
are selfish.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.833
If you don't have custody
of your kids, do you think
hangin' around with somebody

12:11.867 --> 12:13.867
like him--
-Is gonna help me get 'em back
or whatever? No.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.667
-is gonna get your kids back?
Probably not.

12:15.700 --> 12:19.133
-I've said
all the same stuff to myself.
No, I agree with that fully.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.733
I really do.

12:20.767 --> 12:22.967
-Okay, you're not gonna be
charged with anything tonight,
all right?

12:23.067 --> 12:25.700
Just do me a favor
and just have a seat
back on the curb, okay?

12:28.533 --> 12:32.333
All right, Gabriel...
so why did you pull away
from me like that?

12:32.367 --> 12:33.933
Did you think
that you were gonna get away?

12:33.967 --> 12:36.933
-Not really, I-- like,
I-- oh-- I-- I-- I-- I-- I
honestly don't know

12:36.967 --> 12:39.133
what I was thinkin'
when I tried pullin' away,
sir, I really don't.

12:39.167 --> 12:42.467
-There's just so many scenarios
where that could've just gone
so wrong.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.367
-Yeah.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.833
-And you know what--
You know what the worst
of 'em could've been?

12:47.867 --> 12:51.100
-No, I don't.
-You're-- You're runnin'
from me, man.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.167
I don't know
what you got on you,
and next thing you know

12:53.200 --> 12:55.567
is you're tryin' to turn on me,
or you got somethin'
in your hand,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.567
and I perceive that
as a threat?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.767
There's a possibility
that you coulda got shot.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.333
You know what I mean?
And you got four kids, right?

13:02.367 --> 13:06.133
-Yes, sir.
-There's no better motivation
to get sober.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.567
All right, Gabriel, well,
you're gonna be booked
into the Adams County Jail

13:10.600 --> 13:13.233
tonight for possession
of a controlled substance,

13:13.267 --> 13:19.200
Schedule I and Schedule II,
obstructing a peace officer
and resisting arrest, okay?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.100
-All right, man, hang tight.
-All right.

13:21.133 --> 13:26.333
I really was trying to do better
with my life and everything,
but... then I got high, I guess.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.133
-Ruins your life, huh, man?
-Yeah, it did.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.167
-I got a job with the city,
uh, soon as I got outta college.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.400
Uh, I've been doin' this
for a long time.

13:37.433 --> 13:40.067
Uh, I'm an adrenaline junkie.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.767
Uh, I enjoy comin' to work,

13:41.800 --> 13:45.167
uh, I enjoy the task at hand

13:45.200 --> 13:49.133
of, um, investigating things,
and catching the bad guy.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.133
Oh, we got somebody hangin'
outside this business over here.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.633
That business
has been closed for a while
and under construction.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.467
212... she's runnin'.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.133
-(radio chatter)

14:03.167 --> 14:06.400
-I just had a white male
and a white female run from me

14:06.433 --> 14:09.967
to a empty business.
I have 212, I got
a couple officers out with me.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.733
-Voice on radio:
10-4.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.967
-Oh, they locked it.
-Yeah.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.667
(knocking on door)

14:22.700 --> 14:24.467
-Hey, come to the door.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.700
(knocking on door)
I can't hear you!

14:28.867 --> 14:30.667
Come to the door, please.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.900
-Come to the door,
we gotta talk to you.

14:33.933 --> 14:36.333
-We need to verify
that you guys are supposed
to be here.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.800
-I-- I am.
I can verify it right now.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.233
But I didn't
do anything wrong.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.967
-Well, I'm not saying
that you did.
-I don't wanna go--

14:41.067 --> 14:42.367
I don't wanna go
out there right now.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.700
-Listen to me.
-I can get the owner
on the phone right now.

14:44.733 --> 14:47.067
-Open this door,
I'll have you two sit
right here,

14:47.067 --> 14:48.267
and we'll figure this out.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.233
-Are you gonna tackle me?
-We're not gonna tackle you.

14:50.267 --> 14:51.500
-All right.
Okay. Okay.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.067
-Step on out here.
-All right. All right.
All right.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.067
-They just wanna know
the owner's name.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.433
All right. Okay.
-Do you have any weapons?

14:56.467 --> 14:57.900
-No, I don't.
I don't have any weapons, man.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.233
All right.
-Turn around
and let me check.

14:59.267 --> 15:00.333
-All right.
Man, what did I--

15:00.367 --> 15:01.567
-What's your name, now?
-Turn around.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.767
-All I did-- All I did
was like,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.233
all I'm doin'
is just workin' over here...

15:04.267 --> 15:05.833
-Get him away from the door.

15:05.867 --> 15:08.067
I don't think
she's the one I saw.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.833
-I'm supposed to be here.
I'm supposed to be here.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.067
-Wichita Police!

15:11.067 --> 15:13.667
-God, oh, my God...
-Are they allowed to go in?

15:13.700 --> 15:15.600
-Stand up now!
Police department!

15:15.633 --> 15:17.833
Wichita Police!

15:17.867 --> 15:19.500
-Get out!
-Hi.

15:19.533 --> 15:22.067
-Out!
-You scared the hell
out of me.

15:22.100 --> 15:27.600
-By yellin' Wichita Police?
-No, by tappin' on that
damn window.

15:27.633 --> 15:30.433
-That's 'cause you looked
at me-- Get! Go! Outside!

15:30.467 --> 15:31.833
-What is that?
-Now!

15:31.867 --> 15:33.300
-Okay.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.867
-(radio chatter)
-Excuse me.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.467
-Are you arrestin' me?
-Yeah. This is what happens
when you hide.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.400
-I hid because--
-Because the police
were here.

15:43.433 --> 15:47.533
-I-- I told-- Well, I told him
to go outside.
-Let's go outside.

15:47.567 --> 15:50.133
-They got all kinds
of personal stuff back there
in the bathroom,

15:50.167 --> 15:53.467
but I think what they're doin'
is, after hours, livin' in here.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.733
-Mm.
-What else?

15:55.767 --> 15:57.267
I'm curious to hear this one.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.633
-(radio chatter)

15:58.667 --> 16:01.700
-Jamie?
When you saw me,
why'd you run?

16:01.733 --> 16:05.200
-I was-- Well, because
he'd actually told me,
there's a cop, get inside.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.733
I'm like, okay,
so my instinct is just
to go back inside.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.767
Are we not supposed
to be here or what's
the problem?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.800
-Well, that's what--
That's the whole reason
I'm here is because...

16:12.833 --> 16:15.700
I saw you, and you
turn around and you ran.

16:15.733 --> 16:16.867
How well do you know
these people?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.967
-Like I said--
Not well at all.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.567
I don't know him at all.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.300
-Were you cleanin'?
Or were you guys in there
havin' a party?

16:23.333 --> 16:27.300
-Well, I have cleaned--
this doesn't look like it,
but yeah, a few things,

16:27.333 --> 16:30.067
but...
-I was gonna say, yeah,
I don't see too many people

16:30.067 --> 16:32.633
clean in heels.
-(laughs) Drinkin' a few beers.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.200
-I saw the handcuffs
hangin' back there.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.333
It's gotta make you wonder.
-Oh, I seen those
when I came in,

16:36.367 --> 16:39.767
and-- and I'd asked, too.
He just made a joke
about 'em.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.100
-Okay, well, that didn't
concern you none
for your safety,

16:42.133 --> 16:46.067
comin' in there with a guy
you didn't know, and he's
got handcuffs hangin'?

16:46.067 --> 16:49.067
And he's tellin' you
to run from the police?

16:49.100 --> 16:50.933
-Well, yeah, now that you
say it like that.

16:50.967 --> 16:53.700
-Uh, just bear with us
a little bit, okay?

16:53.733 --> 16:55.733
-Hey, Mack, have a seat
again for me, will you?
-Yeah.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.367
-So you found these out back?
-Yeah.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.567
-Did you know one of these
has the same last name
that you're claiming

16:59.600 --> 17:01.300
that you are?
-Huh?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.500
-Did you recognize that?
You told me your last name's--

17:03.533 --> 17:06.333
and one of these ID cards
has-- has the last name.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.467
-Yeah.
That was like, uh, that
was kinda weird.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
That is like, weird.
-That is-- That's very weird.

17:12.533 --> 17:15.467
-That's-- We were trippin' out
on it, dude. That's weird.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.467
-He's not been
positively identified yet.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.567
-Okay.
What do you go by, Mack?
-Mack, yeah.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.667
-Okay.
Let me explain somethin'
to you, okay?

17:21.700 --> 17:24.833
These other officers here
are concerned that
the information

17:24.867 --> 17:26.467
that you're givin' them
is not correct.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.500
-Okay.
-Okay? Do you understand

17:29.533 --> 17:31.167
that if you give them
false information--

17:31.200 --> 17:34.067
-I just wanna call my boss
and let him verify
that this is it.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.733
-Okay, but we're still
gonna have that same issue

17:36.767 --> 17:40.367
of verifyin' who you are,
whether we talk to your boss
or not.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.067
So, why did you not
wanna come talk to us?

17:43.100 --> 17:46.767
-I was, like, in the middle
of somethin', dude, like--
-Like what?

17:46.800 --> 17:50.233
-Was gettin' my freak on, man.
-Okay.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.433
-We were just playin' a game.
-Strip poker?

17:52.467 --> 17:54.500
-Hostages.
-Hostages?

17:54.533 --> 17:56.300
Is that what the handcuffs
were for?
-No, no, no,

17:56.333 --> 17:57.767
we just-- we were just
havin' fun.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.433
She was just out--
We were just-- We were
just chasin' around.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.133
We didn't-- We didn't
do anything wrong, man.

18:02.167 --> 18:05.533
-Okay.
-I've always known him as Mack
when I met him five years ago.

18:05.567 --> 18:10.067
-So Mack's supposed to be
doin' work for him?
-Yeah, he's workin' for him.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.600
-So are you datin' Mack?

18:11.633 --> 18:14.767
-Um, I used-- I used to--
it's not even date,
what do you call it?

18:14.800 --> 18:17.067
Yeah, I guess
it would be dating,
-just talkin' to him

18:17.067 --> 18:19.800
or somethin'?
-Not a relationship.
Just-- Just talkin' to him.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.067
-Like friends with benefits
or somethin'?
-There you go.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.067
-Okay.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.667
-(radio chatter)

18:24.700 --> 18:26.800
-There's the guy.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.367
-Brandon?
-Brandon.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.833
-And that's confirmed
FBI and KBI.
-Okay.

18:33.867 --> 18:37.333
Brandon...
so now that we know
who you really are,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.600
are you gonna have warrants?

18:39.633 --> 18:41.800
I stood here a little bit ago
and explained to you

18:41.833 --> 18:43.900
that you're not gonna
beat the system.

18:43.933 --> 18:46.167
Modern technology,
whether you like it or not,

18:46.200 --> 18:48.100
it's here.

18:48.133 --> 18:50.900
-Send me to jail, man.
What did I really do?

18:50.933 --> 18:52.567
Well, how about obstruct,
for one?

18:52.600 --> 18:54.133
-Stand up for us, please.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.767
When you sit here
and lie to us, like that,
that's obstruction.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.867
-Okay, go ahead and have a seat,
be careful, watch your head.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.067
-And that was all explained
to you.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.600
You told me you had
nothing to worry about.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.733
-Sit tight, okay?

19:05.767 --> 19:06.833
-I think he knew
he had warrants.

19:06.867 --> 19:08.967
We've confirmed him
on warrants?
-Yeah.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.533
-Okay.
Brandon...

19:10.567 --> 19:12.633
-Mack Hardcore.
-Mack Hardcore?

19:12.667 --> 19:15.300
-Mack Hardcore, baby.
-Okay.
You've got three warrants.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.300
-Oh, yeah?
-And you're gonna be charged
with obstruct.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.167
-Like, what's that carry? What?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.167
-Uh... it-- it gonna be
a misdemeanor tonight. Okay?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.533
-It's a misdemeanor?
-Yep.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.300
-All right.
-Well, it looked like

19:25.333 --> 19:27.067
it was a heck of a party
before we showed up.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.333
-Well, what else would
you think there was, like,

19:29.367 --> 19:32.167
big party or somethin'?
-Well, you told me earlier
that you guys

19:32.200 --> 19:34.567
were playin' Hostage.
-Whoa!

19:34.600 --> 19:37.133
No, I was just playin'.
I was the hostage.

19:37.167 --> 19:40.433
-It probably woulda never
gone this far at all if you'da
just come out and talked to me

19:40.467 --> 19:42.867
instead of hidin' back there.
-I understand...

19:42.900 --> 19:45.600
-You're Max Hardcore, man.
-Mack, yes.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Keep on keepin' on, dude.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.433
-Yeah.

19:49.467 --> 19:52.100
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.867
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.300
Cover is code three.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.600
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.300 --> 20:05.867
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.933 --> 20:13.100
