WEBVTT

00:01.622 --> 00:04.349
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.487 --> 00:07.214
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.352 --> 00:11.908
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.046 --> 00:14.842
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.980 --> 00:17.776
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.914 --> 00:21.918
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.575 --> 00:25.956
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.095 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.964
Just to get up that hill

00:34.103 --> 00:36.519
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.657 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.593
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.731 --> 00:43.319
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.115
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.253 --> 00:49.118
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.256 --> 00:53.708
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.846 --> 00:56.573
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.711 --> 00:59.576
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.714 --> 01:05.548
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:11.933 --> 01:14.281
This has really
been some winter.

01:14.419 --> 01:15.730
Yeah. You said it.

01:18.008 --> 01:20.597
Did you know that it
snowed all last night?

01:20.735 --> 01:21.874
Yeah, I heard it.

01:24.739 --> 01:26.120
You heard it snowing?

01:26.258 --> 01:27.915
Yeah. I heard it
on the radio.

01:35.405 --> 01:37.580
Whoo, I'm in the spirit
today, child.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.202
Well, I'm gonna leave
for church now.

01:39.340 --> 01:41.860
Florence, do you
have to go today?

01:41.998 --> 01:43.551
There's a lot
of snow out there.

01:43.689 --> 01:44.863
That don't make
no difference.

01:45.001 --> 01:46.071
The good Lord's
gonna be there,

01:46.209 --> 01:47.590
and I sure don't want
to disappoint him.

01:49.488 --> 01:51.041
That's a lovely sentiment.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.458
Besides, I'm singing in
the church choir today.

01:53.596 --> 01:56.081
Oh, the reverend must be
really happy to have you
in the choir.

01:56.219 --> 01:57.979
Why, thank you,
Mr. Jefferson.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.912
'Cause there ain't nobody
gonna fall asleep
while you singing.

02:04.434 --> 02:06.367
Forgive me for
saying this, Lord.

02:06.505 --> 02:08.990
I know you made
everybody in your image,

02:09.129 --> 02:10.716
but you sure
struck out with him.

02:13.063 --> 02:15.065
Did you hear what
she told him about me?

02:15.204 --> 02:17.102
Well, you brought it
on yourself, George.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.862
I'm sorry I said that,
Mr. Jefferson.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.519
Oh, you are?

02:20.657 --> 02:22.487
That wasn't very
Christian of me.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.041
And when I'm in church today,
I'm gonna pray for you.

02:27.802 --> 02:29.425
And please ask him

02:29.563 --> 02:32.117
to make George
a little more understanding.

02:32.255 --> 02:33.705
I ain't gonna be there
but a couple of hours,

02:33.843 --> 02:34.913
not a lifetime.

02:39.676 --> 02:41.437
Oh, Florence.
Hi, Florence.

02:41.575 --> 02:42.748
It's your in-laws.

02:44.543 --> 02:46.994
Do you have to
yell the bad news
all over the building?

02:47.650 --> 02:48.892
Hi, Louise.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.653
I brought you the
French records you
wanted to borrow.

02:50.791 --> 02:53.173
Oh, thanks.
I mean, merci.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.347
How are
the lessons going?

02:55.485 --> 02:56.486
Oh, fine.

02:56.624 --> 02:57.867
Oh, I think
it's a great idea,

02:58.005 --> 02:59.213
learning
another language.

02:59.351 --> 03:01.319
Hey, George, why don't
you share the fun with her

03:01.457 --> 03:03.010
and learn how
to speak French too?

03:03.148 --> 03:04.598
Why should I learn
how to speak French?

03:04.736 --> 03:06.186
They send me
the bill in English.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.189
Are you going out?

03:09.327 --> 03:11.570
Yep. We're going out
to throw snowballs.

03:11.708 --> 03:12.778
In this weather?

03:12.916 --> 03:14.366
It's hard to make
them in the summer.

03:16.023 --> 03:17.921
Why are you all hanging
all over each other like that?

03:18.301 --> 03:19.613
It's love.

03:19.751 --> 03:21.028
It looks more like drunk.

03:24.169 --> 03:27.759
You're not really going
to throw snowballs, are you?

03:27.897 --> 03:30.175
We sure are.
We sure are.

03:30.313 --> 03:32.350
Then we're gonna take
a walk through the park.

03:32.488 --> 03:33.903
And buy
some hot chestnuts.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.008
Want us to bring you
some nuts back, George?

03:36.146 --> 03:37.803
No, thanks. You two
are enough for one day.

03:40.358 --> 03:41.669
I'm so excited.

03:41.807 --> 03:42.843
We haven't done
stuff like this

03:42.981 --> 03:44.914
since we first
started going together.

03:45.052 --> 03:46.433
We'd ask you
to join us, Louise,

03:46.571 --> 03:50.057
but this is something Helen
and I have to do by ourselves.

03:50.885 --> 03:52.680
Oh, I'm glad,

03:52.818 --> 03:56.028
'cause the only place
I like to see snow is
on Christmas cards.

03:57.478 --> 04:00.067
Well, I must confess,
if it hadn't been for MI,

04:00.205 --> 04:02.242
I would never had
thought about running
around in the street

04:02.380 --> 04:04.071
picking up snowballs.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.418
On this street,
you'd better be careful
that's all you pick up.

04:10.698 --> 04:12.666
What do you mean
"MI"?

04:12.804 --> 04:13.874
Who's MI?

04:14.012 --> 04:15.945
Oh, it's not a who,
it's a what.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.050
MI is Marriage Improvers.

04:18.188 --> 04:19.776
It's an organization
that helps people

04:19.914 --> 04:21.433
to improve
their marriages.

04:21.571 --> 04:23.366
And it's sure helped us
this past week.

04:23.504 --> 04:25.230
Oh, Helen,
I'm sorry.

04:25.368 --> 04:26.887
I didn't know
you were having trouble.

04:27.025 --> 04:28.785
Oh, we weren't.

04:28.923 --> 04:31.029
MI isn't for marriages
that are in trouble.

04:31.167 --> 04:33.376
It's just to make
marriages better.

04:34.653 --> 04:36.759
Look, if you want to
make your marriage better,

04:36.897 --> 04:38.692
you don't need MI,
you need DC.

04:39.969 --> 04:41.039
DC?

04:41.177 --> 04:42.178
Divorce court.

04:44.456 --> 04:45.768
Oh, George.

04:46.562 --> 04:48.011
But I don't get the point.

04:48.149 --> 04:49.323
Neither did we,

04:49.461 --> 04:51.049
till some friends
talked us into trying it,

04:51.187 --> 04:53.569
and it was worth
every cent.

04:53.707 --> 04:56.296
Now Helen and I
are different people.

04:56.434 --> 04:57.849
I could've told you
that for nothing.

05:00.645 --> 05:02.612
Knock it off, George.

05:03.441 --> 05:05.201
What do you mean different?

05:05.339 --> 05:08.653
Well, MI made us realize
that a lot of the old romance

05:08.791 --> 05:10.379
had gone out of our lives.

05:10.517 --> 05:13.347
What our marriage needed
was a breath of fresh air.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.556
And that's why you're
going out in the snow?

05:16.523 --> 05:19.008
Yeah, it's kind of
like an adventure.

05:19.146 --> 05:21.562
We're doing something
crazy together.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.081
Something romantic.

05:24.151 --> 05:26.153
Something romantic.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.569
It does sound like fun,
doesn't it, George?

05:28.707 --> 05:30.985
Why you have to be romantic,
you're already married?

05:32.746 --> 05:34.126
There.
You see, Helen?

05:34.264 --> 05:35.680
We could have become
just like him.

05:35.818 --> 05:37.095
Not you.

05:40.478 --> 05:42.583
But how does
this MI work?

05:42.721 --> 05:44.654
Well, it teaches
you how to share.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.173
And it's
really peaceful.

05:46.311 --> 05:48.417
You go away to a motel
for the week.

05:48.555 --> 05:50.211
You're supposed to do that
before you get married.

05:51.903 --> 05:53.629
George.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.735
I think everybody
could benefit from it.

05:56.873 --> 05:59.289
Why, Helen and I never
realized what problems we had.

05:59.428 --> 06:01.706
Look, Willis, me and Weezy
got a great marriage,

06:01.844 --> 06:04.053
and we ain't got to go to no
crummy motel to talk about it.

06:05.882 --> 06:07.746
Tom and I discovered
we'd been hiding things

06:07.884 --> 06:09.507
we weren't even
aware of.

06:09.645 --> 06:11.509
There were some things
about him other people knew,
but I didn't.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.649
A-ha. The wife is always
the last to know.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.997
Not those kind of things.
Little things.

06:17.135 --> 06:18.688
Little things mean
a lot, you know.

06:18.826 --> 06:21.277
Oh, why don't you
write a song about that?

06:21.415 --> 06:25.557
I think this
Marriage Improvers
sounds very interesting.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.248
Why don't you come
to one of the meetings.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.009
Yes, they're having
a meeting next week.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.735
You and George could
come as our guests.

06:30.873 --> 06:31.874
Sorry, that's out.

06:32.012 --> 06:33.427
I'm gonna be
working that night.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.946
I didn't say
what night it was.

06:35.084 --> 06:37.051
Well, I'm gonna be working
any night the meeting is on.

06:38.777 --> 06:41.366
Oh, that's a dangerous
sign, George.

06:41.504 --> 06:43.057
Staying at work
to avoid the issues.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.335
No. I'm staying at work
to avoid the ghetto.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.926
Sorry, Helen, I guess
the meeting's out.

06:50.064 --> 06:51.652
Well, let's go,
darling.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.310
It's too bad.
I think you're making
a mistake, George.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.794
No, we made
the mistake,

06:55.932 --> 06:57.037
thinking George
would be interested

06:57.175 --> 06:58.418
in something worthwhile.

07:05.528 --> 07:07.254
Them Willises got some nerve
to come down here

07:07.392 --> 07:09.152
and tell us something's wrong
with our marriage.

07:09.636 --> 07:10.947
No, George.

07:11.085 --> 07:13.502
They just said you could make
a good marriage better.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.882
They didn't say there
was anything wrong

07:15.020 --> 07:15.918
with our marriage.

07:16.056 --> 07:17.160
Hmm.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.853
There isn't,
is there?

07:21.475 --> 07:22.614
Isn't what?

07:22.752 --> 07:24.789
Anything wrong
with our marriage.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.239
George.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.759
No. There's nothing wrong.

07:29.897 --> 07:30.967
We got a great marriage.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.831
Now, will you shut up
and let me read the paper?

07:36.283 --> 07:39.286
It sure is wonderful
being reassured like that.

07:41.322 --> 07:43.463
Oh, this is funny.

07:43.601 --> 07:44.912
If it's funny,
let me hear it.

07:45.050 --> 07:48.019
I need a good laugh
after talking to them
goofy Willises.

07:48.157 --> 07:51.056
I don't mean funny, ha-ha.
I mean funny, peculiar.

07:51.194 --> 07:53.024
Oh, then it's
about the Willises?

07:54.991 --> 07:57.338
No, we were talking
about marriage,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.133
and here's
a quiz on it.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.550
It's called "Is Your
Marriage Really Working?"

08:01.688 --> 08:02.792
You want to try it?

08:03.586 --> 08:05.208
No way.

08:05.346 --> 08:07.590
Ah, come on, George.
It could be fun.

08:07.728 --> 08:10.628
Look, Weezy,
I ain't got no time
for no dumb questions.

08:10.766 --> 08:12.733
Hmm. Well, you just
flunked the first one.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.459
Say what?

08:14.597 --> 08:16.254
It says right here,

08:16.392 --> 08:18.221
"Refusing to take
this quiz

08:18.359 --> 08:21.052
"could indicate
one is trying to hide

08:21.190 --> 08:24.745
"one's marital problems
by denying them."

08:24.883 --> 08:26.747
Does it say anything about
one's wife bugging one

08:26.885 --> 08:28.680
while one's trying
to read one's newspaper?

08:30.130 --> 08:32.684
You aren't afraid of answering
these questions, are you?

08:32.822 --> 08:35.204
Of course not.
Ask me, ask me anything.

08:35.342 --> 08:37.171
But I ain't answering
nothin' about sex.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.867
You just flunked
the next five.

08:46.664 --> 08:48.286
Come on, Weezy,
are you gonna ask me
a question or not?

08:48.424 --> 08:50.840
Okay, okay. See, what is
your answer to this one?

08:50.978 --> 08:52.290
"I can't be happy

08:52.428 --> 08:55.396
"unless I always put my mate's
happiness above my own."

08:55.535 --> 08:58.745
That's the way I am.
That's wrong.

08:58.883 --> 09:01.713
"Putting your mate's happiness
above everything else

09:01.851 --> 09:03.232
"isn't love,
it's worship."

09:03.370 --> 09:04.682
Huh. Then you got
nothing to worry about,

09:04.820 --> 09:05.890
'cause I was lying.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.723
What?

09:11.861 --> 09:12.931
Well, I just said that

09:13.069 --> 09:14.208
because I figured that's
what you wanted to hear.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.003
I was afraid to say
what I really thought.

09:16.141 --> 09:17.557
A-ha!

09:18.109 --> 09:19.213
A-ha what?

09:19.351 --> 09:22.216
You just flunked
question 11.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.909
"Do you share your fears
with your loved one?"

09:25.047 --> 09:27.049
Weezy, how can I fail a test
I ain't even taken?

09:27.187 --> 09:28.775
Believe me,
you're flunking it.

09:28.913 --> 09:30.397
Damn it, Weezy,
this ain't fair now.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.572
Don't shout, George!
I'll shout if I want to shout!

09:32.710 --> 09:34.953
Okay, but you just
blew another one!

09:37.784 --> 09:39.958
"Are you unable to have
a simple discussion

09:40.096 --> 09:42.133
"without it turning into
a shouting match?"

09:42.271 --> 09:43.893
I'm tired of this test.
I don't want to hear no more!

09:44.031 --> 09:47.034
Ain't nothin' worse
than a bunch of dumb,
dumb, dumb questions!

09:49.036 --> 09:52.488
Unless it's a bunch of
dumb, dumb, dumb answers!

09:54.455 --> 09:57.251
Will you just forget
about this stupid test?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.184
Just like you forgot
Valentine's Day?

10:00.116 --> 10:02.084
Valentine's Day?

10:02.222 --> 10:03.913
Every year
since we've been married,

10:04.051 --> 10:05.294
you've given me
a box of chocolates,

10:05.432 --> 10:07.330
but this year, nothing.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.643
Look, Weezy,
I didn't forget.

10:09.781 --> 10:11.093
I was just
thinking of you.

10:16.512 --> 10:18.134
What?

10:18.272 --> 10:21.828
Well, you are getting kind
of heavy around the hips,
you know.

10:23.588 --> 10:26.280
Oh, so now I don't
look so good to you?

10:26.418 --> 10:28.075
No, no, no,
you look great to me.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.559
Bigger and
better than ever.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.255
Come on now, Weezy.
This is crazy.

10:35.393 --> 10:36.636
What are we fighting about?

10:37.567 --> 10:38.741
We got a great marriage.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.916
I'm not so sure anymore.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.434
The Willises were right.

10:42.572 --> 10:44.402
Our marriage does
need improvement.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.679
No, it don't!

10:45.817 --> 10:46.887
We are happy,
you hear?

10:47.025 --> 10:48.406
Happy! Happy! Happy!

10:48.544 --> 10:50.304
I'm happy, see?

10:51.858 --> 10:53.860
You're happy. You have
always been happy.

10:53.998 --> 10:56.448
You're gonna
keep on being happy,
even if it kills you.

10:59.037 --> 11:00.280
Where are you going?

11:00.418 --> 11:02.696
Down to Charley's Bar
to celebrate how happy I am.

11:11.636 --> 11:13.431
I'm sorry I had
to call Ralph

11:13.569 --> 11:15.053
to interrupt your
snowball fight,

11:15.191 --> 11:16.641
but I didn't know
what to do.

11:16.779 --> 11:19.679
Oh, it's okay.
It was getting too
one-sided anyway.

11:19.817 --> 11:21.681
Tom hit me twice
as much as I hit him.

11:21.819 --> 11:22.785
How come?

11:22.923 --> 11:24.822
I'm easier to see
in the snow than he is.

11:33.416 --> 11:36.385
Oh, I'm sorry. We shouldn't
joke at a time like this.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.767
If it hadn't been
for you two,

11:38.905 --> 11:41.631
I wouldn't have realized that
our marriage needed help.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.392
But George
won't admit it.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.221
Couldn't you persuade him
to come to one of our

11:45.359 --> 11:46.982
Marriage Improvers meetings?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.535
They're having one
next Thursday.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.502
We could be
divorced by then.

11:51.607 --> 11:54.403
We're not trained
counselors, you know.

11:54.541 --> 11:58.545
But, say, Helen, maybe
they could try these.

11:58.683 --> 12:01.513
Yeah, and we know how
the MI method works.

12:01.651 --> 12:04.896
Maybe we can get
George to try some of
the things we did.

12:05.034 --> 12:06.415
Can you do them in public?

12:07.450 --> 12:09.314
Oh, sure.

12:09.452 --> 12:11.661
The things we did in private
were our own idea.

12:15.424 --> 12:17.598
Oh, George,
you're back.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
No, this ain't me.

12:18.876 --> 12:20.463
It's Sidney Poitier
coming to dinner.

12:22.189 --> 12:24.398
Now, George,
don't start another fight.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.503
I ain't starting no fight.

12:25.641 --> 12:26.573
Yes, you are.

12:26.711 --> 12:28.437
No, I ain't.
I'm too happy.

12:30.853 --> 12:32.717
Hold it, you two.
Maybe I can help.

12:32.855 --> 12:34.201
Yeah, you can help.
You can help your wife

12:34.339 --> 12:35.513
up to your
own apartment.

12:37.273 --> 12:39.172
George, I asked
Tom and Helen
to come here

12:39.310 --> 12:40.967
because we've
got a problem.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.934
That was dumb.
They are the problem.

12:44.211 --> 12:46.386
That's like a mouse asking
the cat to guard his cheese.

12:47.594 --> 12:51.080
Oh, so now I'm
a piece of cheese, am I?

12:51.218 --> 12:52.219
I didn't say that.

12:52.357 --> 12:53.945
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.291
George, why don't
you sit down,

12:55.429 --> 12:56.983
and let's talk this
over rationally.

12:57.121 --> 12:58.191
Good idea.

13:03.506 --> 13:04.749
He went into the john.

13:05.923 --> 13:07.372
Well, you told
him to sit down.

13:10.099 --> 13:11.480
George, come out of there.

13:12.722 --> 13:15.070
Stop acting like a child.

13:15.208 --> 13:16.692
Maybe that's the way
to get him out,

13:16.830 --> 13:18.763
treat him like we did Jenny
when she was a child.

13:18.901 --> 13:20.040
Oh, yes.

13:20.178 --> 13:22.008
That's a good idea, Helen.

13:22.146 --> 13:24.251
Okay, George,
don't come out!

13:24.389 --> 13:25.356
GEORGE: I'm not!

13:25.494 --> 13:26.426
That's right.

13:26.564 --> 13:27.979
You just stay in there,

13:28.117 --> 13:30.948
and everybody out here will
have a good time at the party

13:31.086 --> 13:33.157
and eat up all
your birthday cake.

13:34.710 --> 13:35.918
Birthday cake?
Birthday cake?

13:39.335 --> 13:40.958
Well, that's how
it worked with Jenny.

13:42.718 --> 13:44.340
Maybe we'd better
leave, Louise.

13:44.478 --> 13:46.998
I don't think you need MI.
You need the UN.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.622
I guess you're
right, Helen.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.107
George is just jealous

13:52.245 --> 13:54.834
because you've got a much
better marriage than he has.

13:55.351 --> 13:56.628
That's a lie.

13:58.665 --> 14:00.218
They got a lousy marriage.

14:00.356 --> 14:02.531
Then how come they've been
so happy together

14:02.669 --> 14:03.773
all of these years?

14:03.912 --> 14:05.292
That's just a cover-up.
What?

14:05.430 --> 14:06.915
That's right. You two
got to stay together.

14:07.053 --> 14:09.020
Because if you split up,
you know people would
be talking about you.

14:09.158 --> 14:10.125
If me and Weezy
split up,

14:10.263 --> 14:11.333
ain't nobody gonna
say nothing.

14:13.818 --> 14:15.164
I'd say plenty.

14:15.302 --> 14:16.579
Look, just shut up, Weezy.

14:16.717 --> 14:18.340
Look, black coffee
is stronger

14:18.478 --> 14:20.100
than coffee and
cream any time.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.935
But it ain't as sweet.

14:31.318 --> 14:34.218
Look, me and Weezy
got the best marriage
in this building.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.185
Then why are you
so scared to test it?

14:36.323 --> 14:37.428
I ain't scared of nothing.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.050
Yes, you are.
You're afraid to try

14:39.188 --> 14:41.639
some of the exercises
we did at MI.

14:41.777 --> 14:43.261
No. I ain't. I ain't
afraid of no exercise.

14:43.399 --> 14:44.953
Look, I used to
exercise every day

14:45.091 --> 14:47.127
when I was in the service,
when I was boxing.

14:47.265 --> 14:50.337
Not those kinds
of exercises, George.

14:50.475 --> 14:52.857
No, it's no use, Louise.
He's scared, all right.

14:52.995 --> 14:54.272
All right. All right.
All right.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.929
Bring on your exercises.
Come on.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.552
I'm gonna prove to you that
Weezy is happily married

14:58.690 --> 15:01.107
no matter how miserable
she thinks she is.

15:01.245 --> 15:03.833
Okay. Now you both sit
here on these tables.

15:03.972 --> 15:06.319
George,
you sit right here,

15:06.457 --> 15:08.286
and, Louise,
you sit over here,

15:08.424 --> 15:09.736
and face each other.

15:10.668 --> 15:12.463
Now, this is
a simple exercise

15:12.601 --> 15:14.292
to help you communicate.

15:14.430 --> 15:15.397
This is stupid.

15:15.535 --> 15:16.881
Me and Weezy don't
have to communicate.

15:17.019 --> 15:18.262
We live in the
same apartment.

15:19.401 --> 15:22.024
George, communicating
is somebody talking

15:22.162 --> 15:23.612
and somebody listening.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.924
I know that.

15:25.062 --> 15:26.442
Then do the last half!

15:28.203 --> 15:29.342
The whole purpose of this

15:29.480 --> 15:31.447
is to show each other
what's on your minds.

15:31.585 --> 15:33.656
What's on my mind
is getting this over with.

15:34.588 --> 15:35.658
Uh, what do you do?

15:35.796 --> 15:37.246
Well, you sit here
facing each other,

15:37.384 --> 15:39.593
knees touching
and holding hands.

15:40.801 --> 15:42.286
Okay, now what?

15:42.424 --> 15:43.770
Well, just relax.

15:43.908 --> 15:46.221
Um, why don't you
start, Louise?

15:46.359 --> 15:48.637
Just mention
whatever comes to mind.

15:48.775 --> 15:49.949
What am I
supposed to do?

15:50.087 --> 15:51.571
You answer her
with the first thing

15:51.709 --> 15:53.780
that comes to your mind,
without thinking.

15:53.918 --> 15:55.885
Just like you
always do, George.

15:58.612 --> 16:00.511
Okay? Go.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.099
Okay.

16:02.237 --> 16:03.859
Uh, hot.
Cold.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.309
Sweet.
Sour.

16:05.447 --> 16:06.620
Good.
Me.

16:12.868 --> 16:15.629
"Me"? How did you
come by "me"?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.735
'Cause it's good of me
to sit through this junk.

16:19.461 --> 16:21.083
George.
That's all right, Louise.

16:21.221 --> 16:22.740
If that's the first thing
that came to his mind,

16:22.878 --> 16:24.155
that's what he should say.

16:24.293 --> 16:25.467
Go on.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.572
Uh, high.
Taxes.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.780
Low.
Interest.

16:28.918 --> 16:30.058
Money.
Trucks.

16:30.196 --> 16:33.095
Hold it. I know I'm not
supposed to interrupt,

16:33.233 --> 16:36.650
but what does a truck
have to do with money?

16:36.788 --> 16:39.688
Plenty. Truck goes by curb,
splashes mud on suit.

16:39.826 --> 16:41.690
Suit goes to cleaners.
I make money.

16:47.937 --> 16:49.491
Wait a minute,
you two.

16:49.629 --> 16:51.010
The whole purpose
of this thing

16:51.148 --> 16:53.253
is to dig into
your relationship.

16:53.391 --> 16:55.980
Yes, you must be
much more personal.

16:56.118 --> 16:57.740
Now just forget
that we're here.

16:57.878 --> 16:59.018
I wish I could.

16:59.949 --> 17:01.192
Now, listen, you...

17:01.330 --> 17:03.160
It was the first thing
that popped into my mind.

17:04.954 --> 17:07.026
Start again.
And this time,
make it personal.

17:08.682 --> 17:09.787
Marriage.
Ring.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.306
Sex.
Seven.

17:15.379 --> 17:16.690
I said "sex."

17:16.828 --> 17:18.658
Oh, I thought
you said "six."

17:24.871 --> 17:26.528
For a minute there,
he had me worried.

17:29.531 --> 17:32.154
I'll try again. Sex.

17:32.603 --> 17:33.638
Red light.

17:36.641 --> 17:38.160
What?
Red light.

17:38.298 --> 17:40.335
That means that's
the end of the line.

17:40.473 --> 17:42.923
Whoa. Stop. Dead end.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.305
Look, I'm not opening up
our bedroom door

17:45.443 --> 17:46.720
to Peepin' Tom here.

17:48.446 --> 17:49.896
I don't think this
is working, Tom.

17:50.034 --> 17:51.449
You're right.
Why don't we drop this

17:51.587 --> 17:53.520
and get to the thing
that really helped us
the most?

17:53.658 --> 17:55.143
You mean role reversal?
Yes.

17:55.281 --> 17:56.247
What's that?

17:56.385 --> 17:57.835
Well, you pretend
you're George,

17:57.973 --> 17:59.181
and George pretends
he's you.

17:59.319 --> 18:00.493
For what?

18:00.631 --> 18:01.770
You see,
when you put yourself

18:01.908 --> 18:03.392
into another
person's place,

18:03.530 --> 18:06.015
it helps you to understand
his point of view,

18:06.154 --> 18:08.639
how he thinks,
what his problems are.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.503
Look, Weez, this is all
a bunch of kid stuff.

18:10.641 --> 18:11.780
No, it isn't.

18:11.918 --> 18:13.747
Listen, the Indians
had an expression,

18:13.885 --> 18:15.508
"Never judge another man

18:15.646 --> 18:18.649
"until you've walked in his
moccasins for two moons."

18:18.787 --> 18:20.409
That's why they all
had athlete's feet.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.759
George. Are you going
along with this or not?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.761
Okay. Okay.
I'll pretend to be Weezy.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.384
But I ain't wearing
no dress.

18:30.557 --> 18:31.972
You don't have to.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.802
Now, Louise,
you're George.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.011
And you can pick your
favorite part of the day.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.876
Good. I'll be coming
home from work.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.533
And what will you
be doing, George?

18:40.671 --> 18:43.432
Uh, I'll be reading
the sports page
and drinking a beer.

18:44.330 --> 18:47.264
No. You're Louise,
remember?

18:47.402 --> 18:49.714
You have to do something
she would be doing.

18:49.852 --> 18:51.958
Oh, well, in that case,
then I'll just sit here
and do nothing.

19:03.107 --> 19:04.626
She locked herself out.
Ain't that dumb?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.078
Yeah. She's playing you.

19:12.772 --> 19:13.980
What you doing here?

19:18.398 --> 19:19.434
Hi, Weezy.

19:19.572 --> 19:21.401
Oh, George.
You're home.

19:25.612 --> 19:26.924
I think it's so wonderful

19:27.062 --> 19:28.857
that my man has been out
making all this money

19:28.995 --> 19:30.790
to get all these
wonderful things for me,

19:30.928 --> 19:32.343
more than I deserve.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.662
Ain't you
forgetting something?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.042
Yeah. When do we eat?

19:43.458 --> 19:44.700
Oh, you know
what I mean.

19:45.356 --> 19:46.530
Oh, yeah.

19:49.498 --> 19:51.051
How did everything
go at work today?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.639
Great. Just great.

19:52.777 --> 19:54.089
I opened up
three new stores,

19:54.227 --> 19:56.125
so I'll hardly be
home from now on.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.922
Oh, that's wonderful.

20:01.786 --> 20:04.030
I think it's great that
I got a man who's so smart

20:04.168 --> 20:06.032
to keep me in
all of this luxury.

20:07.827 --> 20:10.036
Now, I'd never say
anything like that.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.452
Well, you
ain't you now.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.247
I'm you.
And you said it.

20:17.837 --> 20:18.907
Tom.

20:19.045 --> 20:20.426
He can say what he wants.

20:20.564 --> 20:22.704
That's how you'll find out
what he's really thinking.

20:22.842 --> 20:24.395
But...
Keep going, Louise.

20:27.502 --> 20:28.986
Anything new, Weezy?

20:29.124 --> 20:32.023
Nothing much.
We're having company
for dinner.

20:32.161 --> 20:33.577
Who?
The Willises.

20:34.474 --> 20:35.648
No way.

20:35.786 --> 20:38.167
Looking at them
is gonna spoil my dinner.

20:38.306 --> 20:39.962
I agree with you, George.

20:40.100 --> 20:43.069
But what can I do? They keep
pushing themselves in here.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.562
He's not playing fair.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.564
I wouldn't say anything
like that, either.

20:55.702 --> 20:56.945
That's what's wrong with you.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.154
If you did once in a while,
we'd get along better.

20:59.775 --> 21:00.707
TOM: Now wait a minute.

21:00.845 --> 21:01.777
Look, you stay
out of this.

21:01.915 --> 21:03.572
You ain't even come
down for dinner yet.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.954
Hold it. This isn't
getting anywhere.

21:06.092 --> 21:07.369
You're both
too angry.

21:07.507 --> 21:08.991
Now you've got to get
rid of your hostility

21:09.129 --> 21:10.372
or nothing will work.

21:10.510 --> 21:11.787
You're right, Helen.

21:11.925 --> 21:13.893
And this is what's
going to do it.

21:18.484 --> 21:19.623
What are those?

21:19.761 --> 21:21.625
They're batacas.
They're made of foam rubber.

21:21.763 --> 21:23.109
It's the best way
to get relief

21:23.247 --> 21:24.662
when the pressure
builds up.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.595
What's the matter with
bicarbonate of soda?

21:28.563 --> 21:29.909
You don't
understand, George.

21:30.047 --> 21:32.429
What you have to do is take
one of those and hit Louise.

21:32.567 --> 21:34.396
Hit Louise?
Anywhere but in the face.

21:34.534 --> 21:36.122
Look, I ain't never hit
Louise a day in my life,

21:36.260 --> 21:37.779
no matter what
stupid thing she did.

21:40.471 --> 21:42.024
Do I get to hit him back?

21:42.818 --> 21:43.819
You sure do.

21:43.957 --> 21:45.131
It doesn't hurt.

21:45.269 --> 21:47.789
And this'll help you both
get rid of all that anger.

21:47.927 --> 21:49.066
Go ahead,
hit him.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.137
This is kind of weird.

21:52.552 --> 21:54.554
Uh, I don't know.

21:54.692 --> 21:56.625
Believe me, Louise,
you'll feel much better.

21:57.454 --> 21:58.834
Well, if you say so.

21:59.525 --> 22:00.491
Like that?

22:00.629 --> 22:02.010
No, like this.

22:10.052 --> 22:13.228
You're right, Helen.
I feel better already.

22:14.885 --> 22:15.955
Oh, yeah.

22:17.508 --> 22:18.544
Get him, Louise.

22:20.304 --> 22:21.305
Yes.

22:22.168 --> 22:23.756
Come on.

22:23.894 --> 22:25.585
Lovely. You're doing
much better.

22:25.723 --> 22:26.897
Come on, Louise.
That's very good.

22:28.519 --> 22:29.831
Get rid of all
the hostilities.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.246
Get the juices flowing.

22:31.384 --> 22:32.351
That's it.
That's it.

22:44.259 --> 22:45.605
You know something,
Willis?

22:45.743 --> 22:47.227
For once in your life,
you were right.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.712
I feel much
better now.

22:49.609 --> 22:50.990
Me too.

22:51.128 --> 22:52.992
That's the whole point.
You see?

22:53.130 --> 22:54.683
You've gotten rid
of that anger.

22:54.821 --> 22:56.927
Now you can speak
freely and easily

22:57.065 --> 22:59.170
and clear up any problem,
no matter how big,

22:59.308 --> 23:00.620
without fighting.

23:00.758 --> 23:02.760
Good. Is this what they
do at those meetings?

23:02.898 --> 23:04.037
Sometimes.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.729
Oh. Well, me and Weezy
ain't got to go, then.

23:05.867 --> 23:07.972
When we get uptight,
we'll just beat each
other's brains out.

23:10.250 --> 23:13.357
That's not fair
because Louise will
always finish first.

23:18.811 --> 23:20.122
Well, I guess
we can go now.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.469
May we have our
batacas back?

23:21.607 --> 23:22.953
No, wait a minute.

23:23.091 --> 23:25.473
I got one little teeny piece
of anger to get rid of yet.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.647
Oh, go ahead.
Let her have it.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.891
Ow!

23:30.029 --> 23:31.306
Hey, you can't
do that.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.859
Why not? You said it
was good for everybody.

23:32.997 --> 23:34.240
That's right.

23:35.137 --> 23:36.725
Oh, George.
I'm gonna...

23:49.151 --> 23:51.430
Stop it. Stop it, I said.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.123
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves,

23:55.261 --> 23:56.538
fighting like that
on the Lord's day.

23:58.644 --> 23:59.955
Florence, how would
you like it

24:00.093 --> 24:01.232
if I never got mad
at you again?

24:01.370 --> 24:02.579
That would be
a blessing.

24:02.717 --> 24:04.028
And how would you like it
if you never got mad at me?

24:04.166 --> 24:05.167
Now, that would be
a miracle.

24:05.305 --> 24:08.032
Okay. Stay right there
a minute.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.206
What's wrong with you?

24:15.902 --> 24:17.421
Yes. Get him.

24:43.412 --> 24:47.037
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
