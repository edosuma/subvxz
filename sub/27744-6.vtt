10:44.018 --> 10:48.689
I know there's a really good explanation
for this, but please, don't tell me yet.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.868
Hello, I'm Todd. I'll be your server--

11:00.951 --> 11:02.036
Not ready to order yet.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.330
And here are your menus.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.458
As is customary,
I will now let you look at them.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.834
[clears throat]

11:10.044 --> 11:14.090
So, uh... thank you
for asking me to brunch, Mallory.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.092
Thanks for saying yes, Jess.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.053
Um...

11:19.637 --> 11:21.764
Wasn't sure
if you were serious or not at first.

11:21.847 --> 11:26.060
[sighs] Yeah, me either,
but my sister was very persuasive.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.479
Your sister wanted you to go out with me?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.565
Yeah, with someone. Um...

11:31.649 --> 11:34.318
It's my first date back
after a really long relationship,

11:34.402 --> 11:35.236
and I'm very nervous.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.947
And I didn't smoke
any of Harrison Ford's Glove Compartment.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.657
Uh... uh...

11:39.740 --> 11:41.033
-I don't--
-I'm sorry.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.577
-I should not have said any of that.
-It's okay.

11:43.661 --> 11:47.164
This is also my first date
after a long relationship.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.457
-Okay.
-So...

11:50.376 --> 11:53.629
I'm sorry. Do you really not recognize me?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.298
Um...

11:56.382 --> 11:59.385
You do look a little bit like Jim Carrey.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.302
[chuckles]

12:01.178 --> 12:02.888
I'm Jumbotron Guy?

12:04.140 --> 12:07.435
The guy that proposed to his girlfriend
and then she said no?

12:07.518 --> 12:11.063
And then I cried and then
they did a close-up of the crying.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.024
Sorry, I've lived in a paper bag
the last several years.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.526
Did anybody see it?

12:16.026 --> 12:17.153
I don't know.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.614
Excuse me, sir, can I borrow your pepper?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.742
Jumbotron Guy!

12:25.828 --> 12:27.580
-Here you go.
-I'm good. Thanks.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.835
In and out.

12:34.295 --> 12:38.674
In and out.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.431
Enjoy the breath, Frankie.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.643
Yeah, enjoy it. It's one of your last.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.770
Shh.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.606
-You're jamming my frequency.
-[sighs]

12:53.689 --> 12:56.692
Now, most ancient cultures believed

12:56.776 --> 12:59.528
that spirits are watching over us,

12:59.612 --> 13:04.742
and that in order to hear their guidance,
we need only to be open,

13:04.825 --> 13:08.537
be aware and... let go.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.664
Ah.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.291
Nice, Renee.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.292
Oh.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.127
You too, male Renee.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.384
You're having a little trouble
with the "letting go" part, Grace?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.719
No.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.432
I just find it easiest to get in touch
with my spirit guide via phone.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.311
And if my spirit guide
does get in touch with me,

13:32.394 --> 13:34.438
I don't want him to think
I'm ignoring him.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.526
[softly]
He's a spirit. He'll understand.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.821
[whispering] You know,
the first time I came here,

13:41.904 --> 13:44.949
I was so freaked out
when they took my phone.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.410
I worried the whole time
something bad was gonna happen.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.372
It turns out, the first night,
my house burned down.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.623
But you know what?

13:52.706 --> 13:57.253
The whole time I was here,
at least in my head, I still had a house.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.089
That is the wrong takeaway
from that experience.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.216
[sighs]

14:04.218 --> 14:05.678
[gong rings]

14:05.761 --> 14:07.555
Well, there's the lunch gong.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.850
Okay, everybody, see you at chow.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.019
[gasps]

14:14.103 --> 14:15.354
[indistinct voices]

14:19.316 --> 14:20.860
Leo, hey!

14:21.485 --> 14:24.238
-It's your old friend, me. [chuckles]
-Yeah, I know.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.614
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.157
Rita told me you were coming.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.742
She told me all about you.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.203
Seems you've made peace
with your choices.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:32.371 --> 14:36.709
That's something we used to say
about other people, not about each other.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.419
One of us is other people.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.338
Now, if you'll excuse me.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.756
Wait. Where are you going?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.467
-To my yurt.
-Hey, yurts. I know from yurts.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.094
Has yours ever exploded?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.264
It will!

14:50.764 --> 14:51.599
[people in video]<i> No?</i>

14:51.682 --> 14:53.475
[man] Oh, you hate to see that.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.810
<i>Is he crying?</i>

14:54.894 --> 14:57.104
Oh. It's not that bad.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.564
She's pretty.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.317
Oh, thank you. That's... helpful.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.861
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.280
I told my friends this was a bad idea.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.408
I'm not ready to date.
I'm not ready to be in public.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.702
This must be a nightmare for you.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.705
Hey, I was braced for a nightmare.
Just thought it'd be me.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.457
Mallory, you're gorgeous.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.543
You're so, so nice.
How could you be a nightmare?

15:20.461 --> 15:22.212
Because I have four young children?

15:22.296 --> 15:23.505
Oh, that's how.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.216
Oh, Jumbotron Guy does jokes.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.386
[chuckles] Jumbotron Guy
was actually a lot of fun to be around

15:29.470 --> 15:32.139
before Jimmy Kimmel
did a remix of him crying.

15:32.222 --> 15:36.435
Well, congrats. You're on a date
with the one person who hadn't seen this.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.312
So isn't that good luck?

15:38.854 --> 15:41.398
Shouldn't we get some drinks
to celebrate at least that?

15:41.482 --> 15:42.816
[chuckles]

15:42.900 --> 15:44.276
Okay, yeah.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.444
Okay.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.445
[cell phone chimes]

15:51.825 --> 15:53.035
[whispers] Bitch.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.204
-[bells ringing softly]
-[waves crashing]

16:01.377 --> 16:04.254
Can't believe that little
<i>Friday Night Light</i> is your brother.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.465
Yeah. I know.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.716
Right?

16:08.884 --> 16:10.719
Look... [clears throat]

16:11.303 --> 16:12.638
I'm in a tough spot.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
Luke doesn't want to go home, as in ever.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.102
Does his mom even know he's here?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.812
I called her. She knows he's safe,

16:19.895 --> 16:22.231
but he refuses
to get on the phone with her.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.274
So make him. What is he, 80 pounds?

16:24.858 --> 16:26.860
He's surprisingly strong.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.112
-Is that--
-Yeah.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.238
-That's his work.
-Mm-hmm.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.614
[Brianna] Oh.

16:31.073 --> 16:35.035
Okay, if I help you, will you
leave me alone here with my dead dogs?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.121
-Done.
-Great. Lukey!

16:37.204 --> 16:39.623
Hey, can you and your ball come in here?

16:42.710 --> 16:44.003
Don't hurt him.

16:46.964 --> 16:47.798
What?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.342
Come sit down next to Auntie Brianna.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.723
[chuckles]

16:59.143 --> 17:01.103
Can you read this? What does it say?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.479
"No drama, please."

17:03.480 --> 17:06.859
I use this to mislead people
because the truth is, I love drama.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.236
If you don't work things out
with your nice, Southern mom,

17:09.319 --> 17:12.531
I'll call her and tell her
you are watching episodes of<i> Girls</i>

17:12.614 --> 17:14.450
in a house full of erotic Judaica.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.036
You can call her
and tell her whatever you want.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.579
I don't care.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.122
You have to care.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.374
Your mom does.
You really have to call her.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.419
No, I don't.
I don't want to talk to her ever again.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.795
You have no idea what it's like

17:26.879 --> 17:29.381
to have one of your parents
lie to you your whole life!

17:30.591 --> 17:33.761
[both snicker, laugh]

17:38.140 --> 17:39.516
Ah.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.894
[indistinct chatter]

17:47.399 --> 17:49.359
He didn't go to his yurt.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.529
It's a good thing, too,
'cause it's gonna explode!

17:53.447 --> 17:56.283
Oh, excuse me, may I borrow that phone?

17:56.366 --> 17:59.620
I won't be long, I just have to make
an angry international call.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.916
That's not a phone, genius.
It's a pressed fig bar.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.542
Well, you can have mine.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.419
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.005
You're not hungry? What's wrong?

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
What's wrong?

18:11.757 --> 18:15.511
That guy thinks I've suddenly become
one of those yoga Beckys

18:15.594 --> 18:18.847
who comes here, makes a bracelet
and calls herself enlightened.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.225
And I am! But it's real with me.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.852
Frankie, why are you obsessing
about this person?

18:23.936 --> 18:27.231
I'm obsessing? You just tried
to call Japan on a brownie.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.316
I think you need another workshop.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.860
No, I need to start acting like me again.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.363
I made a fool of myself
in front of Nick and his mother,

18:34.446 --> 18:37.950
and now I'm here
in this mountaintop Petri dish.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.495
I'm tired, I'm old,
and I got bug bites on my ass.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.123
If you didn't use the DEET, that's on you,

18:44.206 --> 18:46.291
'cause they left it
in our room for a reason.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.751
All of this is your fault.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.837
-My fault?
-Yes!

18:49.920 --> 18:54.007
If I hadn't tried your big grand gesture,
I wouldn't be feeling so awful.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.969
Jesus. Why is everybody
on my case today?

18:57.052 --> 19:00.430
Well, maybe you should take
a good, hard look at that.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.142
[Frankie] Oh, no, you're not storming out.
I'm storming out.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.811
I'm storming out
and I know exactly where I'm going.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.312
[Frankie] So do I!

19:07.646 --> 19:11.316
Excuse me, do you know where
I could find a map of the property?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.779
Listen, you potato sack of Lyme disease,

19:15.863 --> 19:17.322
if you don't give me my phone,

19:17.406 --> 19:21.785
I'm gonna cut you open
so I can watch the lentils spill out!

19:27.207 --> 19:29.418
Why don't you like me anymore?

19:30.169 --> 19:33.380
Ma'am! Please don't throw
the suggestion box at me.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.007
I can just give you your phone back.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.383
You can?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.344
This is a spiritual retreat, not a jail.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.929
It's kind of a jail.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.975
Most people want to spend the weekend
without a phone.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.020
You know, to focus on what really matters.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.355
That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.565
[sighs]

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
Oh, were you waiting for a text
from someone?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.361
-Yeah.
-A guy?

19:56.778 --> 19:57.821
Yeah.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.282
It's been almost two days.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.617
Oof.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.994
He's not going to text me back, is he?

20:04.786 --> 20:05.704
Probably not.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.498
I get it.

20:08.582 --> 20:12.753
I came to this place after a nervous
breakdown... named Jeremy.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.047
And you got through it without booze?

20:15.839 --> 20:17.299
Actually, no.

20:20.093 --> 20:20.928
Here.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.722
I keep this for <i>Jer-mergencies.</i>

20:24.473 --> 20:26.558
It's contraband,
but looks likes you could use it.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.060
Oh, God. Thank you.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.353
-Any time.
-[inhales] Yeah.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.439
Hey, I hope that guy wises up
and comes running back.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.651
-I hope Jeremy does too.
-Oh, no.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.153
Thanks, but he got real bald.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.200
[Frankie] You don't know my life now.

20:43.283 --> 20:46.787
I fought City Hall
and raised hell at a pharmacy!

20:46.870 --> 20:48.997
I have a pretty clear picture.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.041
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.461
I'd say, from your ethical booties
and your green car,

20:54.544 --> 20:56.505
you're still a vegan, but you cheat.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.675
Only if I know the Doritos
have been raised humanely.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.634
Mm-hmm.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.763
I bet your idea of charity
is a check to the whales once a year.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.976
It's a snow leopard, his name is Terrence,
and I get email updates bimonthly.

21:09.059 --> 21:13.105
And I bet that you spent
the Cheney administration inside,

21:13.188 --> 21:15.274
watching<i> Sabrina the Teenage Witch.</i>

21:15.357 --> 21:17.317
It was a subversive show!

21:17.401 --> 21:19.027
There was a talking cat!

21:19.111 --> 21:23.031
And he represented
the dismantling of the social order!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.783
Look, it's not personal.

21:24.866 --> 21:28.537
I know a lot of people
from those days who have changed.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.624
You still dress the part,
but it's not authentic anymore.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.126
-You know what?
-Hmm?

21:34.209 --> 21:37.212
Nothing is more boring
than people who walk around

21:37.296 --> 21:40.048
telling other people
how inauthentic they are.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.718
That's why all the record stores closed!

21:42.801 --> 21:45.512
Look, you started this conversation.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.014
And let me finish it!

21:47.097 --> 21:51.226
If you think hanging around an ashram
for years makes you the Maharishi,

21:51.310 --> 21:52.352
it doesn't.

21:52.436 --> 21:56.773
It makes you
a 75-year-old asshole in a caftan

21:56.857 --> 21:58.984
hiding from the real world.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.361
Congratulations.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.281
That's the first real thing
I've heard you say.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.909
Congratulate me on the second,
you've aged poorly.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.994
You've aged great.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.663
You look like a human Subaru.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.206
You want to come to my yurt?

22:13.290 --> 22:14.624
Hell yes!

22:17.919 --> 22:19.087
Come on.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.883
When my ex and I split,
I was a total wreck.

22:22.966 --> 22:26.094
Oh, yeah? You get flop sweat every
time you hear "Y'all Ready for This"?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.221
No, but equally sad,

22:28.305 --> 22:29.473
last Valentine's Day,

22:29.556 --> 22:34.561
I called the soft-rock station
and dedicated a Sia song to myself...

22:35.187 --> 22:36.313
in an accent.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.814
[laughs]
What kind of accent?

22:37.898 --> 22:41.360
It was like
an Indian-Irish-Caribbean kind of deal.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.278
And it sort of changed as I spoke,

22:43.362 --> 22:44.988
-so I ended up sounding drunk.
-Huh.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.406
-Yeah.
-I'll just leave this here.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.616
-Oh, thank you.
-Hey, um...

22:47.699 --> 22:50.243
How about I get this one
and you get the next one?

22:51.661 --> 22:54.706
Well, the truth is...

22:56.625 --> 22:58.210
There is no next one.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.378
No. I... [sighs]

22:59.461 --> 23:02.798
You know, I'm really not ready
to be in public right now.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.342
I think maybe you're being paranoid.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.677
Three people are filming us as we speak.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.138
Wow. Yeah...

23:14.309 --> 23:18.188
Besides, I got my heart broken pretty bad
and everybody saw it.

23:18.271 --> 23:22.025
And I think I just need to take some time
and maybe grow a beard.

23:22.943 --> 23:23.985
I get it.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.905
You're really great. I'm so sorry.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.409
Please, don't be. Go, I got this.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.954
But you might want to leave
through the kitchen.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.039
Thank you.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.708
[Jess groans]

23:40.335 --> 23:42.129
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.382
Yep. Bye-bye.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.010
I'm sorry. I have to give you money.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.847
-No, that's all right. It's on me.
-[sighs]

23:51.930 --> 23:53.682
That was a terrible first date.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.683
Yeah, it was bad.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.101
No offense. I just--

23:56.184 --> 23:57.269
None taken.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.187
-Yeah.
-Thank you for the drinks.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.647
-Sure.
-Okay.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.693
-You wanna go out sometime?
-No, thanks!

24:04.776 --> 24:05.986
Okay!

24:06.486 --> 24:08.155
So your dads were doing it?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.324
Yeah, for 20 years.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.035
That's two decades of lies, kid.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.163
And weird, lame excuses like,

24:16.246 --> 24:19.249
"I was just checking your dad for crumbs."

24:19.332 --> 24:21.293
I hate dishonesty.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.336
Why do you even talk to them anymore?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.588
That's a great question.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.756
Because we're family.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.135
And-- And that's what you do
for people that love you.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.096
And you know your mom loves you.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.347
But she lied.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.933
Yeah, I know.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.185
Our dads lied, too.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.812
My dad way more convincingly
than his dad.

24:40.896 --> 24:45.317
But they did it because they were
trying to keep their families together.

24:45.400 --> 24:50.530
And yeah, it was fucked up and wrong
in a million different ways,

24:50.614 --> 24:54.117
but they were trying to protect us
like your mom was.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.119
But she lied about you.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.455
That doesn't piss you off at all?

24:58.538 --> 25:00.707
Yeah, it did.

25:01.291 --> 25:05.921
Um, it took a lot of processing
in a time that I couldn't afford therapy.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.510
She was afraid of hurting you.

25:11.593 --> 25:15.055
I didn't like it, but I got it.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.308
[scoffs] She, uh...

25:18.600 --> 25:19.434
[inhales]

25:19.518 --> 25:21.394
She is probably worried sick.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.480
And my dad, too.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.814
And my brothers.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.901
And my basset hound, Joyce.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.110
So call her.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.323
Even if you're mad at her,
do it for Joyce.

25:34.991 --> 25:35.867
Okay.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.620
[inhales]

25:39.704 --> 25:40.664
Thanks, man.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.708
No problem.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.842
Oh, my God.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.638
Did I make you cry?

25:56.721 --> 25:57.973
No.

25:58.056 --> 26:01.142
I got bored and I started reading
the backs of the DVDs.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.480

This is all bullshit.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.592
[Babe laughs] You're telling me.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.052
Babe?

26:36.136 --> 26:37.804
What are you doing here?

26:38.847 --> 26:40.515
Oh, my God, am I dead?

26:41.349 --> 26:42.851
In some ways.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.687
[chuckles]
I'm here because you summoned me...

26:45.770 --> 26:50.233
and because that kid makes the gin
you're drinking in a bathroom.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.777
It does taste a little toilet-y.
[chuckles]

26:55.196 --> 26:56.114

26:57.157 --> 27:00.785
-It's good to see you, Babe.
-Oh, you too, sugar.

27:01.077 --> 27:04.789
So, what's the news?
For what purpose am I being conjured?

27:04.873 --> 27:08.126
I don't know. I screwed up with a guy.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.588
You're probably here to tell me,
"Better to have loved and lost,

27:11.671 --> 27:14.591
-then never--"
-Oh, no, that's crap. It can't be that.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.885
I think I'm here to tell you

27:16.968 --> 27:20.889
that you have been in love
with Frankie this whole time.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.515
Well, it's definitely not that.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.808
[Babe laughs]

27:23.892 --> 27:28.229
She said she'd give me 20 bucks
if I appeared to you and said that.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.148
[chuckles]

27:30.231 --> 27:32.567
Let me tell you a story, Grace.

27:32.651 --> 27:36.154
I was floating along the astral plane
the other day

27:36.237 --> 27:37.530
and my turban blew off.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.240
It was my best turban!

27:39.908 --> 27:43.578
And as it unraveled and unraveled,
I thought... [clicks tongue]

27:43.662 --> 27:46.414
"There goes the best part of me."

27:47.666 --> 27:50.126
But it isn't even a part of me,
it's a hat.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.836
Where you going with this, Babe?

27:52.420 --> 27:55.674
Yeah, I think I lost the thread
for a minute there.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.633
Wait.

27:56.716 --> 28:00.512
Nick is the hat, right?

28:00.595 --> 28:02.222
Because he's blowing away.

28:02.305 --> 28:07.560
Well, he may be blowing away,
but the hat is not the point.

28:07.644 --> 28:12.524
The best-part-of-you part is the point.
What is the best part of you?

28:12.607 --> 28:14.025
My cheek bones?

28:15.193 --> 28:16.319
Frankie.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.445
[scoffs]

28:17.529 --> 28:19.197
How the hell did that happen?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.949
I don't know, but it did.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.078
So, if Nick comes back

28:25.161 --> 28:27.706
and you two hook it up for real...

28:29.541 --> 28:31.710
Then what happens to Frankie?

28:31.793 --> 28:32.961
Bingo.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.547
So what do I do?

28:35.630 --> 28:36.631
Beats me.

28:36.715 --> 28:41.511
I don't know if you know this, but you're
alone in the woods tripping balls.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.371
What are you doing here?

29:08.455 --> 29:09.539
It's not Tuesday.

Oh, I'm here for somebody else.

-[sighs] Oh, thank you, Rita.
-Uh-huh.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.448
Oh, God, Grace, you look like
you slept in the woods.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.908
I did.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.870
Why didn't you come find me?
Did you not notice I wasn't in the room?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.289
No, I thought the silence
from your bunk

29:51.372 --> 29:54.709
was haterade on my goodnight slam poem.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.046
My God, Grace. What were you doing
in the woods all night?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.465
Okay. Bye, Rita!

I know Sambadha didn't do it for you.

To be honest? It may have done something.

So that's what she's doing here.
