00:09.640 --> 00:13.840
-Ragna. I want to know what it is.
-Yeah.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.520
But you'll like it.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.760
Look for something small and black.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.800
-Is it the perfume I wanted?
-You'll see.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.000
You'll like it. Go on.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.840
-I don't like surprises.
-No, but... Christ.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.240
-Is it this one?
-Yes.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.120
-Is it annoying that I'm filming?
-Yes, very.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.080
Open it. Go on.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.920
Is it Mom's?

00:58.440 --> 01:00.160
Didn't Dad give it to you?

01:02.080 --> 01:03.560
I want you to have it.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.760
Since you were
sad about me moving and stuff.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.280
Now you're always protected.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.880
<i>Some say your self,</i>
<i>your identity...</i>

01:15.960 --> 01:17.200
Do you have to film?

01:17.280 --> 01:20.000
<i>...is the sum of all your scars</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:23.760
<i>and your choices</i>
<i>during your darkest hours.</i>

01:26.320 --> 01:29.880
<i>That your fondest memories</i>
<i>have nothing to do with who you are.</i>

01:30.920 --> 01:34.400
<i>If so, I can't survive this.</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:49.680
Helmut, she sent
an informant to the slaughter.

01:49.760 --> 01:54.080
She must have been feeding us
with information from them all along.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.120
I...

01:57.760 --> 02:01.320
We must find something connecting her
to this right-wing terror network.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.120
I'm going to put you
on speaker, okay?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.960
So, they killed the NAD leader.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.520
-And a new attack is imminent.
<i>-Kathi, stop. I just got a message.</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:16.320
<i>It seems like a school</i>
<i>here in Berlin is held hostage.</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:17.360
By whom?

02:17.440 --> 02:20.240
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>Islamic State Europe.</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:23.400
It's them.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.200
Based on this, I would suggest
the following measures...

02:34.240 --> 02:35.560
What is it?

02:35.640 --> 02:38.360
A hostage situation inside a school.
Islamists again.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.240
What? Which school?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.240
A comprehensive school in Berlin
with over 1,000 pupils.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.480
It might be a coincidence, but...

02:47.960 --> 02:50.360
it's your granddaughter
Marie's school.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.600
Negative. Keep the perimeters,
but shut down the area.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.560
I repeat, keep the perimeters,
but shut down the area.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.880
-Minister...
-Where are we?

04:00.960 --> 04:04.240
We have contact.
Our people should stay out of sight.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.600
They threaten to blow up the school
if the children panic.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.120
LKA are sending a terrorism expert.
We tried contacting the school,

04:12.200 --> 04:14.440
but we can't reach anyone.
They're jamming us.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.400
We just got a message with a link.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.560
Video feeds of the classrooms.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.560
Have my daughter brought here.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.960
We have to assume that
my granddaughter is in that school.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.400
What do you advise?
How do we deal with this?

04:44.480 --> 04:47.200
We keep it quiet
and instruct the media accordingly.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.800
But there is no guarantee.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.760
It will come out anyway.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.240
Could you help me, please?

05:11.360 --> 05:12.920
What is it?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.040
-I don't understand the exercise.
-Okay.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.840
Whether it's Mumbai, 9/11 or Paris,

05:20.920 --> 05:23.120
every terrorist attack
has a narcissistic motive.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.960
It's about recognition.
Recognition by the world.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.760
A school has been
targeted before, in Beslan.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.520
They decided to storm the school,
which resulted in many deaths.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.120
So I would recommend getting
the minister's granddaughter out,

05:39.200 --> 05:43.160
to prevent the terrorists
from using the girl as leverage.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.600
We can't evacuate
my granddaughter first.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.320
It would endanger the others.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.880
It's not your decision,
and it wouldn't look good.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.080
This is not about my career.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.360
They are back online.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.000
It looks like they are streaming
from the school's locker room.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.960
This page is now live on Facebook,
YouTube and 8chan,

06:05.040 --> 06:07.080
and it keeps spreading.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.960
Is that one of the teachers?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.240
<i>This is Kasim.</i>

06:15.320 --> 06:19.200
<i>You will free your hostages.</i>
<i>Our brothers.</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:21.680
<i>Together with 54</i>
<i>of our Muslim allies</i>

06:21.760 --> 06:24.760
<i>you have locked up in jail</i>
<i>in the Berlin area.</i>

06:26.800 --> 06:28.840
<i>We will provide</i>
<i>a list of all their names</i>

06:28.920 --> 06:31.400
<i>and expect you to release them.</i>

06:32.320 --> 06:35.520
<i>We are Islamic Europe.</i>
<i>And you will obey.</i>

06:36.600 --> 06:38.120
That's my daughter.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.280
<i>Release our brothers now,</i>
<i>the way I dictate.</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:46.400
<i>If you can't keep</i>
<i>your daughter safe,</i>

06:46.480 --> 06:48.560
<i>how can you protect your people?</i>

06:48.640 --> 06:51.280
Ask for a delay. We need more time.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.000
Connected.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.640
This is Police Commander Hess.
We are willing to negotiate.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.160
Please put down the knife,
so we can talk.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.440
<i>Of course we will talk.</i>
<i>You will respect us.</i>

07:07.520 --> 07:10.720
All we need is time to organize
the transport of your brothers.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.520
<i>How much time do you need?</i>

07:12.600 --> 07:16.280
It's a complex operation. We will
do our best, but need three hours.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.120
Get our brothers. Now.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.440
<i>Or your daughter</i>
<i>is just the beginning.</i>

07:40.520 --> 07:42.720
Get all intel on that school.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.240
All maps, schematics,
everything you can get.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.600
Get him out. Get a doctor.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.760
<i>Ole, everything under control</i>
<i>here at the school.</i>

08:32.440 --> 08:34.240
We have
the minister's attention now.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.680
Make sure all of our men
have left the building.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.920
<i>Yes.</i>

08:39.720 --> 08:43.440
<i>There has been a terror attack</i>
<i>at the Heinrich-von-Kleist School.</i>

08:43.520 --> 08:45.640
<i>A significant number</i>
<i>of students and staff</i>

08:45.720 --> 08:47.960
<i>are being held hostage.</i>
<i>We're live at the scene.</i>

08:48.560 --> 08:50.800
We are now approaching
the school by foot.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.480
All roads have been shut down.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.760
The SEK are here already.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.240
Stay back. Turn the camera off.
Leave the area.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.200
We'll shoot here, then.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.120
We are opposite the school where
a nightmare scenario is unfolding.

09:11.200 --> 09:16.680
<i>The video stream showed the killing</i>
<i>of the minister's daughter live</i>

09:16.760 --> 09:19.560
<i>in the school basement</i>
<i>at the hands of the terrorists.</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:22.760
<i>We need to locate Ragna, ASAP.</i>

09:22.840 --> 09:24.320
Asgeir, do everything you can.

09:25.120 --> 09:29.000
She was close to Cato the last time
she contacted me. Okay?

09:29.080 --> 09:31.160
<i>Send me everything you've got.</i>

09:31.240 --> 09:35.240
<i>...police, with more than</i>
<i>100 responders at the scene, while...</i>

09:36.760 --> 09:37.600
Helmut?

09:37.680 --> 09:40.800
-Have you seen it?
<i>-Yes, I have.</i>

09:41.440 --> 09:42.960
Okay.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.840
-I'll get Eva's things now.
<i>-Good. Hurry.</i>

09:45.920 --> 09:48.720
But we need Jonathan.
He knows how to hack this stuff.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.560
Okay. Good. Hurry.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.040
God, this is so bad.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.920
-So bad.
-Where are you going?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.760
Inger says one of the girls
connected to the Norwegian cell

10:10.840 --> 10:12.040
just arrived in Berlin.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.440
She believes the girl will try
to connect with them.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.120
So I'm gonna track the phone
and see if she can lead us to them.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.600
-Be careful.
-You too.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.560
<i>Increased violence</i>
<i>against Muslims in Germany.</i>

10:23.640 --> 10:27.160
<i>Right-wing groups holding marches</i>
<i>in all major cities in Germany.</i>

10:27.240 --> 10:30.320
<i>Germany and the EU</i>
<i>are in the spotlight.</i>

10:30.400 --> 10:33.040
<i>The situation is</i>
<i>causing fear globally.</i>

10:34.120 --> 10:35.200
Come on.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.280
Why don't you talk to Sigrid?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.720
I don't have time
to be emotional now. She's a risk.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.840
What the hell does that mean?

10:55.760 --> 10:58.520
It means she can't be here
and see what we're doing.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.160
I have a safe place for her,
and you're going with her.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.600
-No way!
-Listen to me. Brehme will kill her.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.600
He doesn't think she will keep quiet.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.160
She doesn't know anything.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.200
Yes, she does.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.880
I heard what you talked about.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.040
Yeah, I figured.
I tried to calm her down.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.120
And this is your fucking mess.
Not mine.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.840
Come with me.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.640
Sigrid shouldn't see this.
She'd put two and two together.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.560
Who's that?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.840
The interior minister's daughter.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.800
What are you doing?

11:58.840 --> 12:02.440
I'm creating 9/11 on European soil,
and the whole world will watch.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.440
A thousand school kids will be blown
to pieces in the name of Islam.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.080
And thereby erase
all memories of Utøya.

12:19.960 --> 12:25.080
This will be the terror attack
that defines Europe,

12:25.160 --> 12:28.240
that defines what to fear
and who to fear.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.880
You're going to blow up a school?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.560
While the whole world is watching.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.960
Look.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.720
We are creating Islamic Europe,

12:50.800 --> 12:53.480
with a leader, Kasim,
that will never be found,

12:53.560 --> 12:54.920
that will never die.

12:57.040 --> 13:02.000
And that me and you, Cato and Furia,
can mobilize a fight against.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.400
We control both sides of the board.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.080
When will it happen?

13:13.800 --> 13:17.520
-I want to be there when it happens.
-First we put Sigrid in a safe house.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.400
She can't be locked up now.
She's scared.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.840
She should be. And so should you.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.720
I asked you if you were willing
to give your life to save Europe.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.440
I'm not just willing to die for this,
but to sacrifice you, sacrifice her.

13:30.520 --> 13:34.200
I've already sacrificed my brother.
I've worked on this for 20 years!

13:34.280 --> 13:35.560
Calm down.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.880
No one's going to know what
we're doing here. You understand?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.360
Come on.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.120
We have to get something.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
Get in.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.400
Let's go.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.160
Look for a clear line of fire
from the opposite building.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.960
Do you have eyes on the upper floors?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
<i>Two in position.</i>

14:25.760 --> 14:27.680
<i>One on the right.</i>

14:30.680 --> 14:32.160
<i>Clear view of the school.</i>

14:43.360 --> 14:45.840
And now we go
to the ongoing situation in Germany.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.000
An ongoing terrorist attack
by a group calling themselves...

14:50.080 --> 14:51.440
...Islamic State Europe.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.080
We can confirm

14:53.160 --> 14:56.840
that the terrorists are threatening
to blow up the school.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.680
...a live video stream...

14:58.760 --> 15:01.720
...showed a regular execution
of one of the hostages...

15:05.880 --> 15:10.800
The group demands the release
of several Muslim prisoners.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.640
Do you have your inhaler?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.480
Any questions?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.320
That's weird, right?

15:58.240 --> 16:02.280
<i>We now get reports of parents</i>
<i>fearing for their children's lives.</i>

16:02.360 --> 16:04.400
<i>A horrible video stream shows...</i>

16:04.480 --> 16:09.520
I wrote down the dates when Eva
gave us information from Yathrib.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.640
Look for patterns. She must have been
in touch with them shortly before.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.520
May I use the bathroom?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.200
You have to wait
until the exercise is finished.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.000
-And what kind of exercise is this?
-A security exercise.

16:56.920 --> 17:01.320
The hostage takers seem to know
the school very well.

17:01.400 --> 17:07.760
All entrances are being watched
by cameras apart from these two.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.000
But I assume it's a trap.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.080
If we try to enter, they might
be rigged with explosives,

17:13.160 --> 17:15.600
or we give them a reason
to kill more hostages.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.560
On their website
you can clearly see...

17:19.640 --> 17:21.440
Can't we block the site?

17:22.600 --> 17:26.120
Or replace it with a simulation,
so it looks like it's still up?

17:26.200 --> 17:28.800
They would notice
via an external tracker.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.400
I bet they monitor the live stream.
It's what gets them attention.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.680
80 million people in the US watched
the evening news on 9/11.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.840
Worldwide,
two billion people tuned in.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.320
Two billion in 2001.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.160
There's a new message.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.600
<i>Islamic Europe demands</i>
<i>the Muslim prisoners</i>

17:48.680 --> 17:51.120
<i>to be ready</i>
<i>on a plane in 60 minutes.</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:53.840
<i>And our brother Salid Musah</i>
<i>as well.</i>

17:53.920 --> 17:56.000
<i>And a list of 54 others</i>

17:56.080 --> 17:59.680
currently under arrest
or in jail unlawfully in Germany.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.320
All our demands must be met.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.800
Our Muslim brothers
have suffered for too long.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.360
And while we wait,

18:07.440 --> 18:11.320
the rest of the world can watch
the children waiting.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.960
What the...?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.760
<i>If you don't meet our demands,</i>

18:17.840 --> 18:21.720
<i>the parents will watch</i>
<i>their children die, too.</i>

18:25.120 --> 18:29.720
<i>Do not shut off this broadcast,</i>
<i>or we will detonate.</i>

18:43.040 --> 18:44.480
What's that?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.880
It's Marie.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.200
<i>Are you going to let other parents</i>
<i>watch their own children die,</i>

18:55.280 --> 18:57.840
<i>the way you saw your daughter die?</i>

19:05.120 --> 19:06.240
Shit.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.920
They killed my daughter.

19:44.400 --> 19:50.600
And now they will blow up the school,
including my granddaughter.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.120
How am I supposed
to remain objective?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.720
Or professional?

19:59.440 --> 20:03.240
And if I can't trust myself,
how should everyone else?

20:05.640 --> 20:08.640
The terrorists are demanding...

20:09.280 --> 20:11.520
that you send
a message to the nation,

20:11.600 --> 20:15.480
apologizing for the mistreatment
of Muslims

20:15.560 --> 20:17.840
in Germany and Europe since 9/11.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.480
They also demand
you do this in front of the school.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.560
<i>Hi, Ole.</i>

21:09.080 --> 21:11.360
<i>Just checking in.</i>
<i>What's the status?</i>

21:11.440 --> 21:13.480
The spreading
is way above our target.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.440
The world is watching. Literally.

21:17.240 --> 21:21.280
<i>Great. Then I'll move on</i>
<i>to the next part of the plan.</i>

23:10.320 --> 23:12.520
I really need to use the bathroom.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.000
-Don't leave me here.
-Just stay calm.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.320
No matter what happens now,

23:30.400 --> 23:34.000
you have to say you were kidnapped
by these guys. Okay?

23:35.960 --> 23:37.840
You promised to look after me.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.000
Listen to me.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.120
You're going to sit here
and pray to God

23:42.200 --> 23:45.480
that whoever comes for you
is sent by me and not your uncle.

23:45.560 --> 23:50.080
Your uncle is going to kill children.
A lot of fucking children.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.000
I've tried to steer you
away from this,

23:52.080 --> 23:54.720
but your uncle is pure evil.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.240
If you continue down the path
you're on now,

23:57.320 --> 24:00.320
then this is how it's gonna end.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.000
They're going to kill kids.
Do you get that?

24:16.800 --> 24:17.640
Hello?

24:17.720 --> 24:21.360
They're going to blow up the school.
They just want to make people watch.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.640
-Okay. Where are you?
<i>-Ole is not at the school.</i>

24:23.720 --> 24:26.360
<i>He controls the explosives</i>
<i>from a different place.</i>

24:26.440 --> 24:28.760
<i>-Do you know where he is?</i>
-The Fassbender District.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.680
Stefan-Richterstrasse 5.
It's a big fucking warehouse.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.960
<i>And contact Inger.</i>
<i>I'm on my way back there now.</i>

24:34.040 --> 24:36.040
Got it. I'll pass it on.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.560
Looking for this?

24:54.520 --> 24:56.760
-Yes.
<i>-He was on to your niece.</i>

24:56.840 --> 24:59.880
-Who?
<i>-The cop. We have him.</i>

25:00.480 --> 25:02.000
How soon until you blow it up?

25:02.080 --> 25:04.840
<i>We need the minister</i>
<i>to do his part first.</i>

25:04.920 --> 25:06.840
Once Thomas is out and clear,

25:06.920 --> 25:08.920
I will blow everything
to dust and rubble.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.440
Focus on what
you have to do, okay? This is it.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.120
I'll do it.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.640
We can't let them dictate
anything to us.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.640
We'll make it our plan.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.880
Maybe we can gain some time
and save the children.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.240
I'm on it.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.800
We don't have much time.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.520
You think it's wise
not telling me anything?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.200
The German police
will be here very soon.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.960
You don't know that we know you.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.600
Not only who you are.
We know your story.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.600
We've looked into you
ever since our paths crossed.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.800
I have connections
with the darker side

26:15.880 --> 26:18.640
of Russian business life.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.880
And, well...

26:22.080 --> 26:23.880
There is a bounty on you.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.320
Ziminov.

26:28.360 --> 26:32.360
He sent me a picture

26:32.440 --> 26:35.280
from a laptop
they found in Vestvik.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.920
She's beautiful.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.600
If anything happens to her,
you die.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.680
Macho games.

26:48.960 --> 26:52.440
Ziminov pays for keeping you alive,
or else you wouldn't be.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.600
I don't do macho games.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.280
So, who do you work with?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.080
I found something.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.800
Scorpio. That's Eva's alias.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.720
Who was she in contact with?

27:13.800 --> 27:17.280
I don't know yet. But the IP address
points to the school's intranet.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.720
But it is Eva for sure.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.400
Okay. Hurry.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.240
Ruben?

27:27.320 --> 27:30.880
<i>The terrorists are not Islamists,</i>
<i>but a far-right terror cell.</i>

27:30.960 --> 27:32.320
I don't have time for this.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.160
<i>You have to,</i>
<i>or this will blow up in your face!</i>

27:35.240 --> 27:36.920
Okay. Talk to me.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.160
<i>Yathrib... chat logs... and Eva...</i>
<i>She isn't just a victim.</i>

27:42.240 --> 27:43.480
She worked with them.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.040
It's supposed
to look like an Islamist terror plot.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.960
Hardenberg is about to make
a statement in front of the school.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.160
Unless you have any evidence,
please just let me do my job.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.120
<i>Ruben...</i>

27:53.200 --> 27:54.400
Shit!

27:54.480 --> 27:57.040
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.520
I'm going down there myself.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.200
None of our phones are working.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.320
-Sit down, please.
-What is this drill?

28:23.400 --> 28:26.840
-Why is the network down?
-It's important that we stay calm.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.400
What do you mean?

28:28.480 --> 28:30.960
Sarah, please,
it'll all be fine, okay?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.480
We can do it.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.680
We'll all get out of here
safe and sound.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.000
<i>The interior minister is on his way</i>
<i>to the Heinrich-von-Kleist School.</i>

28:40.080 --> 28:42.760
<i>He will give a live statement there.</i>

28:42.840 --> 28:48.160
<i>There are still around 1,000 pupils</i>
<i>and teachers inside the school.</i>

28:52.000 --> 28:54.920
No, it can't be done.
There's no time.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.680
<i>The minister is on his way.</i>

29:10.880 --> 29:13.400
<i>Stand by. All quiet.</i>

29:16.960 --> 29:19.040
Hey, it's going to be okay.

29:21.000 --> 29:21.960
Minister.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.320
<i>The minister has arrived</i>
<i>at the school</i>

29:42.400 --> 29:45.440
<i>and is about to make</i>
<i>a live statement.</i>

29:51.080 --> 29:54.600
<i>Mr. Hardenberg,</i>
<i>30 seconds until broadcast.</i>

29:57.200 --> 29:58.280
Helmut.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.760
<i>I checked all of Eva's user accounts.</i>

30:00.840 --> 30:04.080
<i>It appears she was in contact</i>
<i>with a guy called Thomas Tappert.</i>

30:04.160 --> 30:07.320
-Did you run a database check?
<i>-Three Thomas Tapperts in Berlin.</i>

30:07.400 --> 30:09.920
-And?
<i>-One of them works at the school.</i>

30:10.000 --> 30:12.480
-Send me what you have. Quickly.
<i>-Will do.</i>

30:15.960 --> 30:18.240
For security reasons,
we're not allowed nearer.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.760
<i>Bombs are reported at the site.</i>

30:20.840 --> 30:24.480
<i>The interior minister will commence</i>
<i>his statement shortly.</i>

30:25.120 --> 30:27.640
<i>Ole. I'm ready.</i>

30:27.720 --> 30:30.960
<i>You can proceed.</i>
<i>The others are in safety as planned.</i>

30:31.040 --> 30:33.320
Okay. The minister will start
speaking now.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.440
Get in touch
once you're at a safe distance, okay?

30:38.520 --> 30:39.640
<i>Copy.</i>

30:41.920 --> 30:43.400
<i>Okay, we are live.</i>

30:43.480 --> 30:49.200
I am here to address this situation
on behalf of the German government.

30:50.120 --> 30:54.160
I am not doing this because
I want to, but because I must.

30:54.720 --> 30:59.240
<i>Right now, all prisoners on your list</i>

30:59.320 --> 31:03.800
<i>are being driven to the airport,</i>
<i>where a plane is waiting for them.</i>

31:03.880 --> 31:06.440
<i>We will do everything you want.</i>

31:11.160 --> 31:13.880
<i>If we have somehow contributed</i>

31:13.960 --> 31:19.280
in provoking this hatred,
this anger and this violence,

31:20.040 --> 31:21.680
then we are sorry.

32:05.720 --> 32:06.720
In this country,

32:06.800 --> 32:12.400
people of different backgrounds
should feel welcome and at home.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.360
Hey!

32:32.160 --> 32:34.680
-It's me, Thomas.
-Thomas, help us.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.000
I killed one of the terrorists.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.320
We have to get out of here.
We need to get help.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.200
Take this off.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.400
-There's a bomb in the basement.
-A bomb?

32:42.480 --> 32:43.920
What about the children?

32:44.720 --> 32:49.000
Once we're out, the police can focus
on saving the children.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.640
Come on.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.320
We have to hurry.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.560
<i>In Germany, everyone has the right...</i>

33:10.480 --> 33:12.000
What the hell are you doing?

33:14.840 --> 33:16.160
Drop the gun.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.680
It's over.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.400
Who the hell are you?

33:23.880 --> 33:26.360
Asgeir knows everything.
They're on their way.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.360
You fucking whore!

34:02.480 --> 34:04.040
You deceitful cunt!

34:12.680 --> 34:13.640
You can't pass.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.960
I am the head of public safety
at the BMI.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.080
I need to talk to the teachers.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.520
Excuse me, did you get
to see the terrorists' faces?

34:27.600 --> 34:31.120
No one is coming to help you.
Asgeir was taken.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.960
We have to get them out of here.
The bomb squad needs a 1 km cordon.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.880
Hold on. Maybe we can get important
information that will save lives.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.240
This man is injured.
He needs a doctor.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.800
WE FOUND HIM!

35:03.000 --> 35:06.880
We will help you,
but we need medical attention first.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.680
He is one of the terrorists.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.040
No, they are... They are Muslims.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.000
-That guy?
-Yes.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.000
And they will blow up the school.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.440
They are not Islamists,
but a far-right terror cell.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.800
And he is a part of it.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.080
Stop!

35:37.600 --> 35:39.120
He has a gun!

35:48.680 --> 35:50.160
Don't touch that.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.400
Drop it.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.000
Drop it!

35:57.720 --> 36:00.480
<i>Let my daughter remain</i>
<i>the only victim here.</i>

36:01.920 --> 36:04.760
We have an urgent call
from the school on the secure line.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.080
Connected.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.360
<i>Ruben, you have to believe me.</i>
<i>A right-wing cell is behind this.</i>

36:10.440 --> 36:12.480
<i>The demands are fake.</i>

36:13.160 --> 36:15.560
<i>Thomas Tappert is</i>
<i>the evidence we needed.</i>

36:15.640 --> 36:19.520
<i>If we don't act, they will blow up</i>
<i>the school and Minister Hardenberg.</i>

36:20.480 --> 36:23.080
<i>We need to evacuate the school. Now.</i>

36:36.920 --> 36:41.200
Please cooperate, so we can reach
a peaceful conclusion.

36:41.280 --> 36:44.760
<i>Sir, we have new information.</i>
<i>You have to keep talking.</i>

36:44.840 --> 36:46.880
<i>We are sending in the SEK.</i>

36:46.960 --> 36:48.680
<i>It's imperative</i>
<i>that you keep talking.</i>

36:48.760 --> 36:53.840
As you know... Germany has
taken part in NATO operations...

37:57.400 --> 37:59.120
<i>Entering the boiler room.</i>

38:15.120 --> 38:16.800
We need the bomb squad.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.720
Police! Everyone out!

38:28.960 --> 38:31.360
Police! Out!

38:31.960 --> 38:33.760
Over here! Quick!

38:55.000 --> 39:01.320
Today, my wife and I lost
what was most precious...

39:03.920 --> 39:05.840
in our lives.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.880
<i>Minister.</i>

39:07.560 --> 39:09.920
<i>We have the situation under control.</i>

39:21.560 --> 39:22.800
Yeah.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.320
We're compromised.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.520
The police came.
They nearly killed me.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.760
And I can't get ahold of Ole.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.240
<i>I think the police got him.</i>

39:31.320 --> 39:33.280
-Where are you?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

39:33.360 --> 39:36.080
In some street. Hiding.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.560
<i>I'll find a safe place</i>
<i>for us to meet.</i>

39:38.640 --> 39:41.040
I'll send you details.
Stay out of sight.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.320
<i>Where is the world heading?</i>

39:55.160 --> 39:57.800
<i>Depends on how we define ourself.</i>

39:58.320 --> 40:00.760
<i>By the darkness</i>
<i>we've allowed too long?</i>

40:01.680 --> 40:04.400
<i>Or by our will</i>
<i>to protect the light?</i>

40:05.720 --> 40:09.800
<i>I hope my darkest deeds</i>
<i>will not define my true self.</i>

40:09.880 --> 40:11.000
<i>Or us.</i>

40:31.920 --> 40:33.800
<i>They wanted to change us all.</i>

40:34.880 --> 40:36.560
<i>Not just an election.</i>

40:38.440 --> 40:42.840
<i>History will judge how we all act</i>
<i>when our world is coming apart.</i>

40:45.320 --> 40:47.520
<i>Did you save yourself?</i>

40:47.600 --> 40:49.720
<i>Or did you try to save others?</i>

40:55.240 --> 40:58.720
<i>What thoughts and deeds</i>
<i>do you allow to shape your life?</i>

40:58.800 --> 41:02.400
<i>Shape our future? Shape ourself?</i>

41:03.720 --> 41:04.960
<i>Can you heal?</i>

41:06.480 --> 41:07.680
<i>Can I?</i>

41:20.960 --> 41:22.440
So what's the plan now?

41:22.520 --> 41:24.400
Ole and I didn't agree
on everything.

41:25.120 --> 41:29.080
However, we won't win
without a voice.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.200
Anyway...

41:34.280 --> 41:38.120
This group isn't the only one
that answers to Cato.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.280
So even if the cops killed Ole,
it won't stop us.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.000
The plan is to keep Cato alive.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.680
And that's where Furia
and your talent for words comes in.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.160
Okay. What do we need him for?

41:52.240 --> 41:54.080
He knows how the cops found us.

41:54.160 --> 41:57.800
And he knows something
the Russians want to know as well.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.560
What other cells?

42:12.640 --> 42:14.360
I can't say I'm surprised.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.120
What other cells?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.480
You're bluffing.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.440
Move.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.720
Get down.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.320
You were going to kill kids.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.560
Like my sister.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.440
I'm pretty sure
I never killed any Norwegian girl.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.160
Shut the fuck up.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.400
He has a knife. Come here.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.560
Okay, cut me loose.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.160
Let me borrow your phone.
I have to call Michelle.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.040
Of course. Here.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.760
Hello. Hi, are you with her now?

43:13.360 --> 43:14.800
Okay. Good.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.920
Take her somewhere safe
and get someone to protect you.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.040
Yes.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.240
I'm coming home.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.840
-Did you call the cops?
-Of course.

43:30.920 --> 43:35.080
<i>I think what we need now is a...</i>

43:36.800 --> 43:38.960
cross-party statement.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.760
Devoid of any
political self-interest.

43:44.480 --> 43:48.320
Germany needs to know the truth
about these attacks. Right away.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.120
You need to know
that I had help from Norway.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.880
This has to remain top secret.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.440
The identities need to be protected.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.600
This is far from over.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.880
<i>Truth.</i>

44:18.960 --> 44:20.400
<i>I'm like you.</i>

44:20.480 --> 44:24.040
<i>Afraid of the future,</i>
<i>because of the past.</i>

44:27.080 --> 44:30.240
<i>Few know the true darkness</i>
<i>of what I've done.</i>

44:31.480 --> 44:33.720
<i>Or if I can ask for forgiveness.</i>

44:40.200 --> 44:41.320
<i>I know this:</i>

44:42.200 --> 44:44.160
<i>The darkness isn't gone.</i>

44:46.320 --> 44:50.320
<i>This isn't over,</i>
<i>though I will be gone for a while.</i>

44:52.120 --> 44:55.320
<i>These are my last words... for now.</i>

44:56.680 --> 44:58.200
<i>Furia.</i>

45:03.080 --> 45:06.360
