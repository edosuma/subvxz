09:30.066 --> 09:31.833
RADICALLY -- IT'S NOT MY WORDS,

09:31.900 --> 09:33.533
THE PRESIDENT ON FRIDAY SAID I

09:33.600 --> 09:34.800
WANT TO TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.766
THREE FRIDAYS AGO HE SAID IF WE

09:36.833 --> 09:39.033
PASSED MY LEGISLATION, IT WILL

09:39.100 --> 09:39.600
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM THE

09:39.666 --> 09:41.033
STRUCTURE AND NATURE OF THE

09:41.100 --> 09:43.066
COUNTRY, THOSE ARE HIS WORDS,

09:43.133 --> 09:43.533
NOT MINE.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.966
>> Bill: YOUR SITE IS ALWAYS

09:48.033 --> 09:49.433
SAYING -- YOUR OUT OF OFFICE TWO

09:49.500 --> 09:51.466
DAYS IN THE COUNTRY IS AN

09:51.533 --> 09:55.766
IRRETRIEVABLE SHIT HOLE.

09:55.833 --> 10:00.000
IT'S AMAZING TO ME HOW FAST.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.800
TRUMP SLOGAN IS MAKE AMERICA

10:02.866 --> 10:03.400
GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN.

10:03.466 --> 10:05.233
IT'S A PARODY OF ITSELF.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.466
>> TEN MONTHS IN OFFICE, WHAT IS

10:06.533 --> 10:10.233
ONE THING THAT IS GOING WELL

10:10.300 --> 10:12.166
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS

10:12.233 --> 10:12.633
DONE?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.800
>> Bill: WE DID GET OUT OF

10:14.866 --> 10:15.200
AFGHANISTAN.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.433
HE DID NOT STICK THE LANDING ON

10:16.500 --> 10:18.000
HOW IT WAS DONE I WILL AGREE

10:18.066 --> 10:19.100
WITH THAT BUT UNLIKE HIS

10:19.166 --> 10:20.066
PREDECESSORS WHO TALKED ABOUT IT

10:20.133 --> 10:21.300
AND DIDN'T DO IT, IT WAS A BIG

10:21.366 --> 10:24.000
THING THAT HAD TO BE DONE.

10:24.066 --> 10:26.200
>> I THINK WE ARE GOING TO

10:26.266 --> 10:27.533
REGRET HOW WE DONE THAT FOR

10:27.600 --> 10:29.400
DECADES IF NOT GENERATIONS, WE

10:29.466 --> 10:30.533
HAVE LOST ALL FORWARD PRESENCE.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.633
>> Bill: I KNOW THIS KIND OF

10:31.700 --> 10:32.733
STUFF DOESN'T MEAN A LOT TO YOU

10:32.800 --> 10:36.033
BUT THEY ALSO DID LIFT A LOT OF

10:36.100 --> 10:38.800
CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY WITH THE

10:38.866 --> 10:40.400
PANDEMIC RELIEF.

10:40.466 --> 10:42.000
[APPLAUSE]

10:42.066 --> 10:42.433
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.166
ANOTHER THING THEY WANT TO DO,

10:46.233 --> 10:46.600
DENTAL FOR SENIORS.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.466
A LOT OF ILL HEALTH COMES

10:48.533 --> 10:50.766
THROUGH THE MOUTH, NO JOKE,

10:50.833 --> 10:52.966
SEAN.

10:53.033 --> 10:56.000
[LAUGHTER]

10:56.066 --> 10:59.200
IT IS A PORTAL -- IT'S THE KIND

10:59.266 --> 11:01.400
OF THING THAT'S PENNIES ON THE

11:01.466 --> 11:02.700
DOLLAR IF YOU TAKE CARE OF

11:02.766 --> 11:03.966
SENIORS AND THEIR DENTAL.

11:04.033 --> 11:06.666
>> I THINK THE ONE THING AND YOU

11:06.733 --> 11:08.133
STARTED WITH THIS, THERE'S A LOT

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
OF THINGS THAT THERE IS A SHARED

11:09.266 --> 11:11.833
GOAL BUT IT'S HOW WE DO THEM.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.500
>> Bill: YES.

11:12.566 --> 11:14.533
>> TOO MANY TIMES THE ANSWER IS

11:14.600 --> 11:15.766
A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION THAT IS

11:15.833 --> 11:17.033
NOT A WELL RUN, IT'S NOT

11:17.100 --> 11:18.666
EFFICIENT AND WE END UP FOR

11:18.733 --> 11:20.033
DECADES AND GENERATIONS LOOKING

11:20.100 --> 11:21.233
BACK AND SAYING TOO BAD TO.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.333
>> Bill: SO WE ARE JUST

11:22.400 --> 11:24.266
TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS?

11:24.333 --> 11:26.500
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

11:26.566 --> 11:26.733
DO IT.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.900
I THINK YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE

11:28.966 --> 11:31.100
SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT

11:31.166 --> 11:35.433
HEALTH CARE, VA, HEALTH CARE,

11:35.500 --> 11:35.700
MEDICAID.

11:35.766 --> 11:36.566
>> Bill: WE HAVE TO GET BACK

11:36.633 --> 11:38.600
TO THIS TYPE OF NEGOTIATING, I

11:38.666 --> 11:39.566
THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE

11:39.633 --> 11:44.866
DISCUSSION AS OPPOSED TO KEY

11:44.933 --> 11:45.466
WOULD NONBELIEFS DEMOCRATS EAT

11:45.533 --> 11:45.700
BABIES.

11:45.766 --> 11:47.633
HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE WITH THAT

11:47.700 --> 11:47.866
PERSON?

11:47.933 --> 11:50.633
WILL MAKE YOU LITTLE BIT ON THE

11:50.700 --> 11:51.833
CORPORATE TAX RATE IF YOU STOP

11:51.900 --> 11:54.833
EATING BABIES?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.033
THAT'S A BIG PART OF YOUR

11:56.100 --> 11:56.633
CONSTITUENCY.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.033
>> NO IT'S NOT.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.400
>> Bill: HE WOULD NONIS NOT?

12:00.466 --> 12:04.600
YOU RENOUNCE CUE SKEWING ON?

12:04.666 --> 12:06.766
>> I DON'T EAT BABIES, NOT

12:06.833 --> 12:07.000
ANYMORE.

12:07.066 --> 12:08.733
>> Bill: THEY ARE ACCUSING THE

12:08.800 --> 12:11.000
OTHER SIDE, THEY ARE SEEING THE

12:11.066 --> 12:11.766
DEMOCRATS EAT BABIES.

12:11.833 --> 12:14.100
>> I DON'T THINK THAT.

12:14.166 --> 12:14.600
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT THE

12:14.666 --> 12:18.133
ELECTION IS RIGGED AND TRUMP

12:18.200 --> 12:18.433
REALLY WON?

12:18.500 --> 12:21.600
>> I THINK THERE ARE SERIOUS

12:21.666 --> 12:23.233
PROBLEMS -- TIMEOUT.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.666
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA,

12:24.733 --> 12:26.633
WISCONSIN, NEVADA, THE IDEA THAT

12:26.700 --> 12:28.033
WE CHANGED RULES RUNNING UP TO

12:28.100 --> 12:29.033
AN ELECTION IN TERMS OF HOW A

12:29.100 --> 12:31.166
BALLOT WAS COUNTED, WHEN IT WAS

12:31.233 --> 12:32.800
COUNTED, DO YOU THINK

12:32.866 --> 12:34.266
PENNSYLVANIA, THE LAW SIGNED BY

12:34.333 --> 12:36.966
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IN 2019, X77

12:37.033 --> 12:38.900
SIGNED BY GOVERNOR WOLF SAID

12:38.966 --> 12:40.266
THAT ALL BALLOTS HAD TO BE IN --

12:40.333 --> 12:42.233
>> Bill: THERE WAS A PANDEMIC.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.366
>> SO CHANGE THE LAW.

12:43.433 --> 12:46.633
>> Bill: THERE WAS NO TIME TO

12:46.700 --> 12:48.700
DO THAT.

12:48.766 --> 12:49.366
THERE WASN'T.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.233
>> PLENTY OF TIME TO PASS

12:51.300 --> 12:52.466
LEGISLATION IN ALL THESE OTHER

12:52.533 --> 12:52.933
AREAS.

12:53.000 --> 12:53.633
>> Bill: THIS IS A RABBIT HOLE

12:53.700 --> 12:57.233
YOU WANT TO GO DOWN TO AVOID THE

12:57.300 --> 12:59.266
QUESTION, DID TRUMP WIN OR LOSE

12:59.333 --> 12:59.900
THE ELECTION?

12:59.966 --> 13:00.266
>> I DON'T KNOW!

13:00.333 --> 13:02.700
>> Bill: THERE YOU GO BECAUSE

13:02.766 --> 13:03.066
THE WORLD DOES.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.033
>> TELL ME HOW MANY VOTES THAT

13:05.100 --> 13:07.600
GOT CAST ILLEGALLY AND NOT

13:07.666 --> 13:08.133
ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM --

13:08.200 --> 13:10.800
>> Bill: THIS WAS LITIGATED

13:10.866 --> 13:12.466
AND EVERY COURT EVEN REPUBLICANS

13:12.533 --> 13:14.200
WERE IN CHARGE OF THE VOTE CAME

13:14.266 --> 13:14.866
DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THIS

13:14.933 --> 13:19.166
ELECTION WAS FAIRLY ADJUDICATED,

13:19.233 --> 13:22.100
YOU YOURSELF THEY ASKED YOU

13:22.166 --> 13:23.400
ABOUT FRAUD.

13:23.466 --> 13:26.700
>> WHAT I HAVE SEEN -- THERE'S A

13:26.766 --> 13:29.466
DIFFERENCE.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.633
WHAT PENNSYLVANIA'S

13:30.700 --> 13:31.466
SUPREME COURT DID, WHAT

13:31.533 --> 13:33.933
WISCONSIN'S CLERKS IT DID, THEY

13:34.000 --> 13:34.966
LET PEOPLE -- WISCONSIN DOES NOT

13:35.033 --> 13:36.200
HAVE A PROVISION IN THEIR LAW TO

13:36.266 --> 13:38.466
LET PEOPLE VOTE EARLY IN PERSON,

13:38.533 --> 13:40.533
IT HAS AN ABSENTEE BALLOT

13:40.600 --> 13:40.800
PROVISION.

13:40.866 --> 13:44.033
PEOPLE SET UP TABLES IN PARKS IN

13:44.100 --> 13:45.800
MADISON, WISCONSIN, AND ALLOWED

13:45.866 --> 13:46.966
PEOPLE TO COME WITHOUT

13:47.033 --> 13:47.600
IDENTIFICATION, IN PENNSYLVANIA

13:47.666 --> 13:49.833
THEY WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE

13:49.900 --> 13:51.233
WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION, NO

13:51.300 --> 13:52.733
POSTMARK ON THE BALLOT IN

13:52.800 --> 13:54.666
VIOLATION OF ACT 77 SIGNED BY A

13:54.733 --> 13:56.433
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IN 2019.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
THE ANSWER IS DON'T WORRY ABOUT

13:57.566 --> 13:59.033
IT BECAUSE IT'S A PANDEMIC.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.966
WHAT'S THE NEXT THING YOU CAN

14:01.033 --> 14:01.900
JUST BLOW AWAY?

14:01.966 --> 14:03.400
A LAW IS A LAW UNTIL IT'S

14:03.466 --> 14:04.433
CHANGED COME YOU DON'T GET TO

14:04.500 --> 14:06.100
PICK WHAT YOU WANT TO FOLLOW

14:06.166 --> 14:08.200
DEPENDING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

14:08.266 --> 14:10.866
OUTSIDE.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.533
>> Bill: THIS WAS LOOKED AT

14:12.600 --> 14:12.866
EXHAUSTIVELY.

14:12.933 --> 14:16.833
>> WHAT WAS LOOKED AT IN

14:16.900 --> 14:20.833
WISCONSIN, THE COURT RULED 4-3.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.733
>> Bill: YOU SAID YOUR PIECE,

14:22.800 --> 14:24.133
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS, YOU'RE

14:24.200 --> 14:25.633
LIKE THAT KID IN SCHOOL --

14:25.700 --> 14:30.033
>> WHO IS RIGHT.

14:30.100 --> 14:30.433
[LAUGHTER]

14:30.500 --> 14:31.633
>> Bill: WHO HAS TO ANSWER

14:31.700 --> 14:33.366
ABOUT THE BOOK REPORT SO HE

14:33.433 --> 14:34.733
READS ONE PAGE VERY CAREFULLY

14:34.800 --> 14:35.733
THAT NOBODY ELSE READ AND DOES A

14:35.800 --> 14:36.566
THING ON THAT AND THEN WE DON'T

14:36.633 --> 14:40.700
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:40.766 --> 14:41.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

14:41.233 --> 14:42.266
>> IT'S YOUR SHOW.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.166
>> Bill: WHAT I DO KNOW IS

14:45.233 --> 14:46.766
THAT THIS WAS LOOKED AT BY

14:46.833 --> 14:49.200
PEOPLE FROM BOTH PTIES AND

14:49.266 --> 14:51.833
PEOPLE HAVE COME DOWN ON THE

14:51.900 --> 14:52.966
IDEA THAT TRUMP LOST THIS

14:53.033 --> 14:55.200
ELECTION AND HE WON'T SAY IT.

14:55.266 --> 14:57.433
AND YOU'RE EITHER A PART OF THE

14:57.500 --> 14:58.600
BIG LIE OR YOU'RE PART OF A

14:58.666 --> 14:58.900
CONSPIRACY.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.066
>> IS NOT A BIG LIE, THE

15:01.133 --> 15:04.633
WISCONSIN STATE AUDIT COMMITTEE

15:04.700 --> 15:08.400
JUST RELEASED A REPORT.

15:08.466 --> 15:08.933
>> Bill: YOU'RE AFRAID OF

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
TRUMP.

15:12.066 --> 15:12.866
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

15:12.933 --> 15:15.833
>> TIMEOUT, YOU SAID I'M NOT

15:15.900 --> 15:17.466
SEEN -- I WASN'T ON THE

15:17.533 --> 15:18.133
CAMPAIGN, I DID NOT SEE EVIDENCE

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.600
WHAT I DID SAY IN WHAT I'M

15:20.666 --> 15:22.233
TELLING YOU IS IN CERTAIN STATES

15:22.300 --> 15:23.533
WHERE THEY SENT OUT BALLOTS THAT

15:23.600 --> 15:24.766
WERE NOT REQUESTED IN VIOLATION

15:24.833 --> 15:30.333
OF A LAW, THAT CO SHOULD CONCERN

15:30.400 --> 15:32.533
EVERYBODY.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.666
>> Bill: HE STILL LOST THE

15:34.733 --> 15:37.800
ELECTION.

15:37.866 --> 15:39.666
SO HE DID LOSE THE ELECTION?

15:39.733 --> 15:41.233
>> BIDEN AS PRESIDENT.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.166
>> Bill: YOU WORK IN THE

15:43.233 --> 15:44.000
CONSERVATIVE SPHERE OF MEDIA.

15:44.066 --> 15:45.800
IF YOU SAY WHAT I WANT YOU TO

15:45.866 --> 15:47.700
SAY, WHAT I THINK YOU TRULY

15:47.766 --> 15:52.266
BELIEVE, YOU WON'T GET YOUR JOB

15:52.333 --> 15:52.500
JOB, --

15:52.566 --> 15:54.166
>> I'M STILL GOOD.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.533
>> Bill: THEY PAY YOU, BUT I

15:56.600 --> 15:57.400
THINK IT WILL TAKE YOU OFF THE

15:57.466 --> 15:58.366
AIR AND YOU WANT THE ATTENTION

15:58.433 --> 15:59.033
TO MY DON'T BLAME YOU IF YOU

15:59.100 --> 15:59.733
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.133
THIS IS OUR PROBLEM WITH THE

16:01.200 --> 16:03.033
COUNTRY, WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD

16:03.100 --> 16:05.000
BECAUSE TWO-THIRDS OF YOUR PARTY

16:05.066 --> 16:05.666
IS BEHOLDEN TO THIS IDEA THAT IS

16:05.733 --> 16:10.866
NOT TRUE.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.333
WHEN THE COUNTRY GOES TO A PLACE

16:12.400 --> 16:14.466
THAT ARE NOT ABOUT ELECTIONS

16:14.533 --> 16:15.400
ABOUT THE ISSUES AND ELECTIONS

16:15.466 --> 16:16.400
BUT ABOUT THE ELECTIONS

16:16.466 --> 16:17.566
THEMSELVES, THEN YOU'RE IN

16:17.633 --> 16:17.800
TROUBLE.

16:17.866 --> 16:21.033
>> IF YOU DON'T THINK STATES

16:21.100 --> 16:22.133
CHANGING RULES -- THAT'S

16:22.200 --> 16:22.400
DIFFERENT.

16:22.466 --> 16:25.166
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN --

16:25.233 --> 16:27.266
>> Bill: IT HAPPEN FOR A

16:27.333 --> 16:29.400
REASON.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.866
>> BECAUSE IT'S A PANDEMIC YOU

16:30.933 --> 16:32.566
CAN DO ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT?

16:32.633 --> 16:36.033
>> Bill: YOUR HIDING ALL OF

16:36.100 --> 16:45.433
THIS ON ONE -- IT'S BULLSHIT.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.366
>> I JUST CITED THREE STATES AND

16:46.433 --> 16:47.866
COURTS THAT HAVE COME OUT ON

16:47.933 --> 16:50.933
THEM, NOT BY ME, NOT BY TRUMP

16:51.000 --> 16:52.433
BUT BY THOSE STATES.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.033
LET'S ARGUE THAT, TELL ME WHAT

16:54.100 --> 16:55.800
YOU FOUND RIGHT ABOUT WHAT ANY

16:55.866 --> 16:57.000
OF THOSE THREE STATES HE DID IN

16:57.066 --> 16:59.066
VIOLATION OF THEIR OWN LAWS?

16:59.133 --> 17:01.933
>> Bill: I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT

17:02.000 --> 17:03.233
IT AS CLOSELY AS YOU HAVE BUT A

17:03.300 --> 17:04.833
LOT OF PEOPLE MORE QUALIFIED

17:04.900 --> 17:06.300
THAN ME HAVING PUTTING PEOPLE IN

17:06.366 --> 17:07.033
YOUR OWN PARTY.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.733
COURTS LOOKED AT IT, THIS WAS

17:08.800 --> 17:11.600
LITIGATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER

17:11.666 --> 17:13.000
AGAIN.

25:33.033 --> 25:33.566
WHO BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS

25:33.633 --> 25:35.933
CAUSED BY HUMANS.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.366
I JUST TOLD YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE

25:37.433 --> 25:39.966
ARE WILLING TO SPEND HOW MUCH

25:40.033 --> 25:40.166
MONEY.

25:40.233 --> 25:41.633
WE ARE NOT SERIOUS.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.000
THE OTHER REASON I'M PESSIMISTIC

25:43.066 --> 25:43.666
IS BECAUSE WE ARE SO CONCERNED

25:43.733 --> 25:46.066
ABOUT THE PAST.

25:46.133 --> 25:49.866
LET ME TO SWITCH THAT.

25:49.933 --> 25:50.466
THERE'S AN ELECTION IT'S GOING

25:50.533 --> 25:52.300
ON IN VIRGINIA IN NOVEMBER, OFF

25:52.366 --> 25:53.766
YEAR ELECTION, THEY ARE VERY

25:53.833 --> 25:54.900
RARE.

25:54.966 --> 25:56.566
BUT VIRGINIA HAS THEM, THE

25:56.633 --> 25:57.900
COMMONWEALTH OR WHATEVER THEY

25:57.966 --> 26:00.066
CALL VIRGINIA, IT'S ONE OF THOSE

26:00.133 --> 26:02.833
WEIRD -- WE ARE STILL IN THIS

26:02.900 --> 26:04.366
18TH CENTURY --

26:04.433 --> 26:05.466
TERRY McAULIFFE, HE WAS THE

26:05.533 --> 26:06.300
GOVERNOR, HE'S RUNNING AGAIN.

26:06.366 --> 26:09.233
HE SHOULD WALK AWAY WITH IT,

26:09.300 --> 26:10.800
BIDEN WON THE STATE BY TEN

26:10.866 --> 26:12.033
POINTS, IT HASN'T GONE STATEWIDE

26:12.100 --> 26:13.800
FOR REPUBLICAN SINCE 2009, HE'S

26:13.866 --> 26:15.733
NECK AND NECK BECAUSE THE ISSUE

26:15.800 --> 26:16.433
BECAME SCHOOLS.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.133
I SAID THIS MONTHS AND MONTHS

26:18.200 --> 26:20.466
AGO, THE ISSUE IN THE COMING

26:20.533 --> 26:22.133
ELECTIONS IS GOING TO BE WHAT'S

26:22.200 --> 26:25.433
GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.533
PARENTS VOTE AND THEY DON'T LIKE

26:26.600 --> 26:27.733
WHAT'S GOING ON IN SCHOOL, THEY

26:27.800 --> 26:29.900
FEEL LIKE THEY ARE LOSING

26:29.966 --> 26:30.766
CONTROL AND THIS BECAME THE

26:30.833 --> 26:31.966
ISSUE IN THIS ELECTION.

26:32.033 --> 26:34.033
TRUST ME, THIS IS GOING TO BE A

26:34.100 --> 26:35.966
HUGE BAROMETER KIND OF ELECTION

26:36.033 --> 26:36.900
BECAUSE TERRY McAULIFFE LOSES,

26:36.966 --> 26:38.200
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT'S

26:38.266 --> 26:41.066
RIGHT, IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT

26:41.133 --> 26:41.666
THAT.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.600
HERE'S WHAT TERRY McAULIFFE

26:42.666 --> 26:44.066
SAID AND WE'LL GET INTO THE

26:44.133 --> 26:45.066
BACKDROP OF THIS.

26:45.133 --> 26:46.866
HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO LET

26:46.933 --> 26:49.300
PARENTS COME INTO SCHOOLS -- NOT

26:49.366 --> 26:53.000
A GOOD IDEA, THAT RIGHT THERE,

26:53.066 --> 26:54.566
DEMOCRATS ARE SO USED TO TALKING

26:54.633 --> 26:54.866
TO TEACHERS.

26:54.933 --> 26:56.333
THIS IS A MIGHT DROP APPLAUSE

26:56.400 --> 26:57.533
LINE TO TEACHERS, NOT SO MUCH

26:57.600 --> 26:59.433
WITH PARENTS.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.166
"I'M NOT GOING TO LET PARENTS

27:01.233 --> 27:02.566
COME INTO SCHOOLS AND TAKE BOOKS

27:02.633 --> 27:03.733
OUT AND MAKE THEIR OWN

27:03.800 --> 27:04.133
DECISIONS.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.166
I DON'T THINK PARENTS SHOULD BE

27:05.233 --> 27:06.366
TELLING SCHOOLS WHAT THEY SHOULD

27:06.433 --> 27:11.066
TEACH.

27:11.133 --> 27:12.800
"JUST ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL,

27:12.866 --> 27:14.700
FUCKING -- EXCUSE ME, VERY

27:14.766 --> 27:15.566
STUPID.

27:15.633 --> 27:16.133
[LAUGHTER]

27:16.200 --> 27:17.366
>> I WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER BEFORE

27:17.433 --> 27:19.500
I BECAME A WRITER, I TAUGHT

27:19.566 --> 27:21.000
SCHOOL FOR TEN YEARS.

27:21.066 --> 27:22.800
THERE IS NOTHING MORE INCENDIARY

27:22.866 --> 27:24.266
THAN THE IDEA THAT TEACHERS WANT

27:24.333 --> 27:26.166
TO TEACH SOMETHING PARENTS DON'T

27:26.233 --> 27:28.833
WANT THEIR KIDS TO LEARN AND

27:28.900 --> 27:29.433
THAT'S WHAT THE SCOPES MONKEY

27:29.500 --> 27:33.733
TRIAL WAS ALL ABOUT.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.433
IT WAS TEACH EVOLUTION IN

27:35.500 --> 27:38.366
TENNESSEE IN THE 1920s, A VERY

27:38.433 --> 27:39.900
BRAVE TEACHER IN AN ACTIVE CIVIL

27:39.966 --> 27:40.533
DISOBEDIENCE SAID I'M NOT GOOD

27:40.600 --> 27:42.966
TO TEACH ABOUT IN A SCIENCE

27:43.033 --> 27:44.466
CLASSROOM AND CLARENCE DARROW

27:44.533 --> 27:45.066
CAME DOWN AND DEFENDED HIM AND

27:45.133 --> 27:46.733
SAID IF YOU CAN'T TEACH IT IN

27:46.800 --> 27:47.733
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TODAY, YOU

27:47.800 --> 27:49.633
CAN'T TEACH IT IN THE PRIVATE

27:49.700 --> 27:50.566
SCHOOLS TOMORROW, YOU CAN'T

27:50.633 --> 27:52.066
TEACH IT IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE,

27:52.133 --> 27:52.966
THIS IS ALL BACK WHEN WE THOUGHT

27:53.033 --> 27:59.433
FREE SPEECH WAS A GOOD THING.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.566
SETTING ASIDE THE VERY REAL

28:01.633 --> 28:02.966
ISSUES THAT ARE UNDERGIRDING

28:03.033 --> 28:04.900
THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION,

28:04.966 --> 28:06.900
POLITICALLY IT WAS SUCH A STUPID

28:06.966 --> 28:07.400
THING TO SAY.

28:07.466 --> 28:10.533
>> Bill: THE UNDERGIRD IS THIS

28:10.600 --> 28:10.733
THIS.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
IT'S A BOOK BEING TAUGHT, TONI

28:12.866 --> 28:15.800
MORRISON'S "BELOVED."

28:15.866 --> 28:18.200
THAT'S A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE

28:18.266 --> 28:19.833
TAUGHT, IT IS FULL OF STUFF THAT

28:19.900 --> 28:21.766
IS DIFFICULT BUT WE ARE TALKING

28:21.833 --> 28:24.033
ABOUT 17, 18-YEAR-OLD KIDS.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.700
IT HAS BEAST REALITY, SEX, AND

28:26.766 --> 28:27.700
VIOLENCE, ALL OF WHICH THEY SAW

28:27.766 --> 28:29.566
ON THEIR PHONE WHEN THEY WERE

28:29.633 --> 28:31.033
TEN WHEN YOU LET THEM LOCK

28:31.100 --> 28:36.933
THEMSELVES UP IN THEIR ROOM.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.800
>> I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE PICKING

28:38.866 --> 28:39.700
UP ON THIS BELOVED ISSUE, THE

28:39.766 --> 28:42.733
ISSUE HERE IS, EIGHT YEARS AGO

28:42.800 --> 28:46.966
SOME WOMAN'S SON READ BELOVED IN

28:47.033 --> 28:50.066
AP LITERATURE AND HE HAD A

28:50.133 --> 28:51.100
NIGHTMARE, IT'S A GHOST STORY,

28:51.166 --> 28:54.933
THAT WAS A GOOD RESPONSE.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.500
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

28:56.566 --> 28:58.600
BELOVED IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE,

28:58.666 --> 29:00.433
THAT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE, IS NOT

29:00.500 --> 29:02.733
A STATE ISSUE, THE AP'S NATIONAL

29:02.800 --> 29:03.433
TEST AND ORGANIZATION.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.000
ALL DUE RESPECT TO THIS MOTHER,

29:06.066 --> 29:07.500
TRULY, SOME KIDS AREN'T READY

29:07.566 --> 29:10.233
FOR AP.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.000
THAT IS A COLLEGE CLASS, IT'S

29:12.066 --> 29:14.766
NOT A HIGH SCHOOL CLASS.

29:14.833 --> 29:15.566
[APPLAUSE]

29:15.633 --> 29:18.233
I THINK THE ISSUE IS, PEOPLE ARE

29:18.300 --> 29:22.233
LOOKING AT THAT IT'S A RACIST

29:22.300 --> 29:24.733
ISSUE AND RACE IS ALL THROUGHOUT

29:24.800 --> 29:27.700
THIS, BUT I THINK IT'S MORE

29:27.766 --> 29:28.200
COMPLEX THAN THAT BOOK.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.666
>> Bill: I THINK IT'S GOOD

29:29.733 --> 29:31.733
THAT IT'S COMING TO THE FORE

29:31.800 --> 29:33.200
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO START

29:33.266 --> 29:34.566
DEFINING WHAT "CRITICAL RACE

29:34.633 --> 29:35.633
THEORY" MEANS.

29:35.700 --> 29:36.900
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO EVERYBODY

29:36.966 --> 29:39.566
WHEN THEY HEAR IT.

29:39.633 --> 29:41.600
IF IT MEANS YOU TEACH TONI

29:41.666 --> 29:42.800
MORRISON, I'M FOR IT.

29:42.866 --> 29:45.066
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.533
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT CRITICAL

29:46.600 --> 29:47.666
RACE THEORY IN THE SCHOOLS, OF

29:47.733 --> 29:48.700
COURSE YOU CAN TEACH IT IN THE

29:48.766 --> 29:49.733
SCHOOLS, THERE'S NOTHING YOU

29:49.800 --> 29:51.533
CAN'T TEACH IF YOU TEACH IT IN

29:51.600 --> 29:53.000
SOCRATIC METHOD, IT CAN BE IN A

29:53.066 --> 29:56.400
GOVERNMENT CLASS, A U.S. HISTORY

29:56.466 --> 29:57.800
CLASS, IS THE WAY YOU LOOK AT

29:57.866 --> 29:59.366
MARXISM AS A FRAMEWORK, IT IS A

29:59.433 --> 29:59.966
LOT OF DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS,

30:00.033 --> 30:02.400
WHAT YOU CANNOT DO AND WHAT IS

30:02.466 --> 30:03.866
HAPPENING IS YOU CAN'T SET

30:03.933 --> 30:04.800
SCHOOL POLICY BY DEFINING

30:04.866 --> 30:06.800
CRITICAL RACE THEORY, YOU CAN'T

30:06.866 --> 30:08.400
REWRITE A CURRICULUM AND HE

30:08.466 --> 30:09.033
REALLY CANNOT TREAT CHILDREN IN

30:09.100 --> 30:10.900
A WAY THAT YOU ARE PULLING THEM

30:10.966 --> 30:13.566
OUT BY RACE AND GIVING THEM

30:13.633 --> 30:14.566
DIFFERENT MESSAGES AND THAT IS

30:14.633 --> 30:15.500
WHAT YOU CANNOT DO AND IT'S

30:15.566 --> 30:15.766
HAPPENING.

30:15.833 --> 30:20.100
[APPLAUSE]

30:20.166 --> 30:21.166
>> Bill: IF THAT IS WHAT

30:21.233 --> 30:22.600
CRITICAL RACE THEORY MEANS, IF

30:22.666 --> 30:24.133
IT MEANS SEPARATING 5-YEAR-OLDS

30:24.200 --> 30:25.966
BY RACE AND TELLING SOME YOUR

30:26.033 --> 30:27.533
OPPRESSORS AND THE OTHERS YOU

30:27.600 --> 30:30.333
ARE THE OPPRESSED AND GIVING UP

30:30.400 --> 30:32.300
ON A COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY AND

30:32.366 --> 30:32.933
RESEGREGATION AND RACISM IS THE

30:33.000 --> 30:35.766
ESSENCE OF AMERICA, THEN I'M

30:35.833 --> 30:36.000
OUT.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.433
>> THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.966
>> Bill: BUT I'M IN ON TONI

30:40.033 --> 30:41.400
MORRISON, I'M IN ON

30:41.466 --> 30:42.000
ACKNOWLEDGING RACISM STILL

30:42.066 --> 30:42.266
PERSISTS.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.600
>> WE DON'T NEED TONI MORRISON,

30:44.666 --> 30:46.800
WE JUSTIFY HER ON LITERARY

30:46.866 --> 30:47.300
GROUNDS.

30:47.366 --> 30:49.566
THIS IS GREAT AMERICAN WRITER,

30:49.633 --> 30:51.200
IF PEOPLE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A

30:51.266 --> 30:55.933
LITERATURE PROGRAM WHO WOULDN'T

30:56.000 --> 30:57.333
INCLUDE ONE NOVEL BY MORRISON,

30:57.400 --> 30:58.833
THAT IS WHAT SPEAKS LOUDLY TO

30:58.900 --> 30:59.666
YOUNG PEOPLE.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.600
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO

31:01.666 --> 31:03.266
BUILD CURRICULA THAT DON'T HAVE

31:03.333 --> 31:04.666
ANYTHING TO DO WITH -- LISTEN,

31:04.733 --> 31:06.733
TERRY McAULIFFE, I'M A

31:06.800 --> 31:09.600
DEMOCRAT, I LOVE YOU, BUT HE'S A

31:09.666 --> 31:11.766
HALF POLITICIAN AND HE'S SIDING

31:11.833 --> 31:12.400
WITH THE TEACHERS UNION BECAUSE

31:12.466 --> 31:13.800
HE'S LIKE THAT IS WHERE HIS

31:13.866 --> 31:16.733
BREAD IS BUTTERED.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.133
HE SENT ALL HIS KIDS TO PRIVATE

31:18.200 --> 31:19.333
SCHOOLS AND HE'S NEVER IN HIS

31:19.400 --> 31:20.433
LIFE HAD SOMEONE TELL HIM WE ARE

31:20.500 --> 31:22.166
GOING TO TELL YOUR 8-YEAR-OLD

31:22.233 --> 31:22.766
CHILD IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T

31:22.833 --> 31:26.666
WANT HER TO KNOW AND WE ARE

31:26.733 --> 31:27.933
GOING TO KEEP HER SEVEN HOURS TO

31:28.000 --> 31:30.600
DO IT AND YOU HAVE NO CONTROL.

31:30.666 --> 31:32.300
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE, DEMOCRATS

31:32.366 --> 31:34.000
ARE GOING TO LEARN TO GO RUN

31:34.066 --> 31:35.700
SOME PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES, ONE

31:35.766 --> 31:37.733
PEOPLE WHO STAND FOR PROGRESSIVE

31:37.800 --> 31:37.966
IDEAS.

31:38.033 --> 31:40.000
DON'T RUN THESE RETREADS, WHERE

31:40.066 --> 31:49.033
ARE WE GETTING THE IS?

31:49.100 --> 31:50.833
JOE BIDEN, AT LEAST HE GOT IN

31:50.900 --> 31:51.933
BUT TERRY McAULIFFE, THERE'S

31:52.000 --> 31:53.800
GOT TO BECOME A THANK GOD YOU

31:53.866 --> 31:54.566
ARE HERE, WE NEED YOU.

31:54.633 --> 32:00.400
THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY.

32:00.466 --> 32:03.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

32:03.800 --> 32:06.500
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW IF THE

32:06.566 --> 32:07.500
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS LACKING FOR

32:07.566 --> 32:08.066
PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS.

32:08.133 --> 32:10.533
>> WE SEEM TO HAVE PLENTY.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.366
>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A

32:13.433 --> 32:14.533
PROGRESSIVE?

32:14.600 --> 32:16.000
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

32:16.066 --> 32:17.166
THESE WACKY NEW SOCIAL IDEAS, IT

32:17.233 --> 32:19.400
MEANS YOU STAND --

32:19.466 --> 32:20.166
>> Bill: WHATEVER IT IS,

32:20.233 --> 32:24.233
JOE BIDEN SIGNED ONTO IT FULLY.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.800
HE'S 110 BUT HE SIGNED ONTO

32:26.866 --> 32:27.000
THAT.

32:27.066 --> 32:28.133
>> WE USED TO STAND FOR THE

32:28.200 --> 32:30.266
WORKING MAN AND WOMAN, THAT'S

32:30.333 --> 32:31.133
WHO WE WERE.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.800
>> THAT IS THE AGENDA THAT THE

32:33.866 --> 32:34.600
PRESIDENT IS MOVING FORWARD.

32:34.666 --> 32:36.666
>> THE POLICIES ARE BETTER.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.033
>> IT IS NOT A RADICAL PLAN.

32:38.100 --> 32:41.666
[APPLAUSE]

32:41.733 --> 32:44.500
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR

32:44.566 --> 32:46.133
WEEKS AND WEEKS AND I BELIEVE WE

32:46.200 --> 32:47.766
WILL DELIVER IN THE COMING WEEK

32:47.833 --> 32:48.900
IS A PLAN IT'S GOING TO DEAL

32:49.000 --> 32:50.966
WITH THE COSTS THAT KEEP WORKING

32:51.033 --> 32:52.800
FAMILIES UP AT NIGHT.

32:52.866 --> 32:55.200
HEALTH CARE, DAY CARE, PRE-K,

32:55.266 --> 32:57.366
ELDERCARE, THESE ARE THINGS THAT

32:57.433 --> 32:57.933
MATTER AND COMBATING CLIMATE

32:58.000 --> 32:58.233
CHANGE.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.000
THAT'S NOT A RADICAL PLAN,

33:00.066 --> 33:00.633
THAT'S SIMPLY DEALING WITH

33:00.700 --> 33:02.800
THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT IN FRONT

33:02.866 --> 33:04.966
OF US.

33:05.033 --> 33:06.466
>> Bill: OKAY, SO IT'S

33:06.533 --> 33:10.200
HALLOWEEN EVE?

33:10.266 --> 33:10.533
TODAY, FRIDAY.

35:11.666 --> 35:12.666
HALLOWEEN, HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND

35:17.166 --> 35:18.233
I HOPE SO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MY

37:23.166 --> 37:24.866
IS BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW BY

37:24.933 --> 37:25.966
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND WE HAVE TO

37:26.033 --> 37:27.033
RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO HIS

37:30.866 --> 37:32.500
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

37:32.566 --> 37:34.233
COUNTRIES THAT ARE MINIMALLY

37:34.300 --> 37:37.533
VACCINATED BECAUSE IF A VARIANCE

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
DEVELOPS OUT IN THE WORLD THAT

37:38.666 --> 37:39.933
IS ABLE TO DEFEAT THE VACCINE,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.733
WE ARE ALL THE WAY BACK AT THE

37:42.800 --> 37:43.566
BEGINNING.

37:43.633 --> 37:44.800
IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST

37:44.866 --> 37:45.700
OF THE WESTERN WORLD WE ARE

37:45.766 --> 37:47.966
READY TO BE DONE WITH THIS BUT

37:48.033 --> 37:49.400
WE ARE NOT DONE UNTIL THE WORLD

37:49.466 --> 37:52.633
IS SAFE AND WE ARE NOT SAFE

37:52.700 --> 37:55.200
UNTIL THE WORLD IS VACCINATED.

37:55.266 --> 37:57.600
>> Bill: THE WORLD RECOGNIZES

37:57.666 --> 38:00.966
NATURAL IMMUNITY, WE DON'T.

38:01.033 --> 38:02.266
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THIS

38:02.333 --> 38:03.566
COUNTRY HAS TO GO THROUGH THE

38:03.633 --> 38:06.900
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY >>

38:06.966 --> 38:08.500
NATURAL IMMUNITY IS THE BEST

38:08.566 --> 38:11.200
KIND OF IMMUNITY, WE SHOULD FIRE

38:11.266 --> 38:13.266
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NATURAL

38:13.333 --> 38:14.733
IMMUNITY WON'T GET THE VACCINE,

38:14.800 --> 38:16.400
WE SHOULD HIRE THEM.

38:16.466 --> 38:17.766
>> IF SOMEONE HAS ANTIBODIES.

38:17.833 --> 38:18.566
>> Bill: PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD

38:18.633 --> 38:22.700
IT, I'VE HAD IT, I SHOULDN'T BE

38:22.766 --> 38:23.533
TESTED ANYMORE.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.000
I'VE HAD THE VACCINE.

38:25.066 --> 38:26.800
>> IF SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO BE

38:26.866 --> 38:29.166
A FIREMAN, POLICEMAN, GO INTO A

38:29.233 --> 38:31.433
BURNING BUILDING AND IT SAYS I'M

38:31.500 --> 38:32.366
JUST NOT THAT AFRAID OF COVID

38:32.433 --> 38:33.600
AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE

38:33.666 --> 38:35.200
VACCINE, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

38:35.266 --> 38:36.766
SHOULDN'T BE LOSING HIS JOB,

38:36.833 --> 38:37.733
SHOULD BE FURLOUGHED WITHOUT

38:37.800 --> 38:39.000
PAY, THE GUY THAT SAVED LIVES

38:39.066 --> 38:41.000
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE

38:41.066 --> 38:43.066
A VACCINE, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:43.133 --> 38:44.366
>> Bill: A LITTLE MESSAGING.

38:44.433 --> 38:47.100
I SEE IT ALL THE TIME, I SOUGHT

38:47.166 --> 38:49.066
DRIVING INTO DAY.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.000
PEOPLE OUTSIDE, ALONE WALKING

38:50.066 --> 38:51.666
WITH A MASK.

38:51.733 --> 38:54.466
IT'S SO STUPID.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.500
IT'S AN AMULET.

38:57.566 --> 39:01.366
A CHARM PEOPLE WHERE.

39:01.433 --> 39:03.366
THAT WARDS AWAY EVIL SPIRIT, IT

39:03.433 --> 39:04.700
MEANS NOTHING.

39:04.766 --> 39:07.666
CAN'T WE GET PEOPLE TO

39:07.733 --> 39:10.300
UNDERSTAND THE FACTS MORE?

39:10.366 --> 39:11.933
LISTEN TO THIS.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.433
FOR UNVACCINATED HOSPITALIZATION

39:13.500 --> 39:15.833
RISK, ON VACCINATED, 41% OF

39:15.900 --> 39:20.433
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT IT WAS OVER

39:20.500 --> 39:22.600
50%.

39:22.666 --> 39:25.833
UNVACCINATED -- I DON'T HAVE

39:25.900 --> 39:27.866
THAT.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.500
HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR THE

39:29.566 --> 39:32.700
VACCINATED IS ACTUALLY .01% AND

39:32.766 --> 39:36.366
THE RATE FOR THE UNVACCINATED IS

39:36.433 --> 39:38.133
.89%, IN BOTH CASES, THE CORRECT

39:38.200 --> 39:39.333
ANSWER IS LESS THAN 1%, THEY

39:39.400 --> 39:42.166
THOUGHT IT WAS OVER 50.

39:42.233 --> 39:43.933
HOW DO PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OF ONE

39:44.000 --> 39:46.066
PARTY GET SUCH A BAD IDEA, WHERE

39:46.133 --> 39:47.200
DID THAT COME FROM?

39:47.266 --> 39:48.900
>> HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.800
WE'VE GOT SAFE, EFFECTIVE

39:50.866 --> 39:51.566
VACCINES THAT HAVE SAVED

39:51.633 --> 39:52.833
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LIVES.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.566
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS, 700,000

39:56.633 --> 39:57.066
AMERICANS HAVE DIED.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.900
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM

39:58.966 --> 39:59.200
NEEDLESSLY.

39:59.266 --> 40:02.066
I'M WILLING TO GIVE

40:02.133 --> 40:03.866
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE PREVIOUS

40:03.933 --> 40:05.566
ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

40:05.633 --> 40:06.200
CREDIT FOR OPERATION WARP SPEED

40:06.266 --> 40:08.966
FOR DEVELOPING THESE REMARKABLE

40:09.033 --> 40:10.100
LIFE-SAVING, WORLD SAVING

40:10.166 --> 40:10.933
VACCINES BUT I FRANKLY THINK WE

40:11.000 --> 40:13.366
SHOULDN'T LET UP ON THE URGENCY

40:13.433 --> 40:16.366
OF STILL PROMOTING VACCINATION

40:16.433 --> 40:19.133
SO WE CAN ENJOY REOPENING OUR

40:19.200 --> 40:20.266
SOCIETY, GETTING BACK TO NORMAL

40:20.333 --> 40:20.466
LIFE.

40:20.533 --> 40:23.933

40:24.000 --> 40:25.666

40:25.733 --> 40:26.866

40:26.933 --> 40:29.266
OF HOW MANY HAVE DIED EXACTLY

40:29.333 --> 40:30.100
FROM COVID OR COMPLICATIONS FROM

40:30.166 --> 40:31.433
COVID TO.

40:31.500 --> 40:36.000
ANECDOTALLY WHEN COLIN POWELL --

40:36.066 --> 40:37.200

ALL I HEARD WAS HE DIED FROM

40:41.066 --> 40:44.266
COVID TO.

40:44.333 --> 40:47.333
YES, IF YOU ARE VERY SICK,

40:47.400 --> 40:48.000
SOMETHING IS GOING TO --

40:48.066 --> 40:50.866
>> THERE WAS A WOMAN IN

40:50.933 --> 40:52.000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," SHE'S 113

40:52.066 --> 40:54.933
AND COVID TOOK HER OUT.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.900
SHE'S 113.

40:55.966 --> 40:58.733
THAT'S ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH OF

40:58.800 --> 40:59.966
YOU.

41:00.033 --> 41:00.766
[LAUGHTER]

41:00.833 --> 41:02.533

41:02.600 --> 41:05.700

41:05.766 --> 41:07.233

41:07.300 --> 41:12.933
113-YEAR-OLD VOTE.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.900
[LAUGHTER]

41:13.966 --> 41:14.566
SPEAK OF THE CENTENARIAN

41:14.633 --> 41:14.866

41:16.200 --> 41:18.000
TIME BECAUSE OF CANCER, I LOOK

41:18.066 --> 41:20.133
AT THIS COVID STUFF AND IT'S

41:20.200 --> 41:21.700
LIKE ANYONE I KNOW WITH CANCER

41:21.766 --> 41:24.000
WOULD GIVE ANYTHING FOR THOSE

41:24.066 --> 41:26.666
ODDS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT

41:26.733 --> 41:27.266
PEOPLE WITH COMPLICATED HEALTH

41:27.333 --> 41:28.766
HISTORIES A LOT OF THE TIME.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.066
WE ARE LOOKING AT OBESITY AS AN

41:31.133 --> 41:33.700
ISSUE BUT NO ONE WANTS TO SAY IT

41:33.766 --> 41:34.466
BECAUSE IT'S A BODY POSITIVITY.

41:34.533 --> 41:38.400
AND WE ARE LOOKING AT POVERTY,

41:38.466 --> 41:40.266
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS,

41:40.333 --> 41:41.066
PEOPLE LIVING CLOSE TOGETHER.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.333
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

41:43.400 --> 41:44.366
DIFFERENT POOR COMMUNITIES THAT

41:44.433 --> 41:45.100
DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT TO.

41:45.166 --> 41:47.500
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR CHANCES, BE

41:47.566 --> 41:49.133
THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL AND GO

41:49.200 --> 41:50.166
BACK OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE

41:50.233 --> 41:53.733
THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN DENSE

41:53.800 --> 41:54.400
HOUSING HAVE COMPLETE ACCESS TO

41:54.466 --> 41:54.700
THE VACCINE.

41:54.766 --> 41:57.733
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT --

41:57.800 --> 41:59.066
>> Bill: WE GOT TO GET BACK TO

41:59.133 --> 42:00.200
LIFE, LOOK AT THE SPORTING

42:00.266 --> 42:01.033
EVENTS.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.700
ALL THREE SPORTS ARE PLAYING NOW

42:02.766 --> 42:05.000
INCLUDING BASKETBALL WHICH IS

42:05.066 --> 42:05.933
INSIDE.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.366
NOBODY SEEMS TO BE HAVING

42:08.433 --> 42:09.366
SUPER-SPREADER EVENTS.

42:09.433 --> 42:10.733
IT WAS GREAT, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN

42:10.800 --> 42:12.800
HAVING A PANDEMIC.

42:12.866 --> 42:16.400
[LAUGHTER]

42:16.466 --> 42:18.166
BYE-BYE.

42:18.233 --> 42:18.900
>> A CHANCE TO IMPROVE OUR

42:18.966 --> 42:23.733
BAKING SKILLS AND WALK OUR DOG.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.833
>> Bill: I KNOW YOUR NEW

42:25.900 --> 42:26.866
ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC IS ABOUT

42:26.933 --> 42:29.133
TOXIC MASCULINITY.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.433
>> IT'S ABOUT HEROIC

42:30.500 --> 42:30.733
MASCULINITY.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.100
>> Bill: FIGHTING THE IDEA.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.733
DOES ANOTHER THING THAT PARENTS

42:34.800 --> 42:36.333
I THINK AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE

42:36.400 --> 42:38.200
CONCERNED ABOUT, I'VE READ THIS

42:38.266 --> 42:42.833
IN SCHOOLS IS BOYS ARE SOMETIMES

42:42.900 --> 42:44.900
CASTIGATED FOR BASICALLY JUST

42:44.966 --> 42:46.066
BEING BOYS.

42:46.133 --> 42:48.066
>> IT'S JUST AWFUL.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.133
WE HAD THIS WONDERFUL CHANGE IN

42:49.200 --> 42:50.700
OUR CULTURE, WE GET IT, IT'S

42:50.766 --> 42:54.333
GREAT TO BE GAY, WE ARE WAY

42:54.400 --> 42:56.766
AHEAD ON TRANS ISSUES AND

42:56.833 --> 42:57.933
WOMEN'S ISSUES AND FEMINISM AND

42:58.000 --> 42:58.900
ALL THAT.

42:58.966 --> 43:00.900
BUT IF YOU GET A BOY AND HE

43:00.966 --> 43:02.000
WANTS TO RUN FAST AND HE WANTS

43:02.066 --> 43:03.933
TO KICK THINGS AND HE WANTS TO

43:04.000 --> 43:07.766
JUMP, TOXIC MASCULINITY.

43:07.833 --> 43:08.700
HE LIKES STORIES ABOUT HEROES,

43:08.766 --> 43:10.266
THERE WAS A BIG ARTICLE IN

43:10.333 --> 43:11.300
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SOME WOMAN

43:11.366 --> 43:12.466
IS SAYING I'M REALLY CONCERNED

43:12.533 --> 43:14.300
ABOUT MY THREE SONS, THEY LIKE

43:14.366 --> 43:15.733
STORIES ABOUT SAVING THE DAY,

43:15.800 --> 43:16.666
THE LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

43:16.733 --> 43:19.633
WHERE THEY CAN BE A HERO, THAT'S

43:19.700 --> 43:20.633
CALLED HEROIC MASCULINITY

43:20.700 --> 43:21.700
COMMITS A REAL THING.

43:21.766 --> 43:22.900
WE NEED IT'S, IT'S BEEN PART OF

43:23.000 --> 43:25.733
HUMANITY SINCE THE BEGINNING,

43:25.800 --> 43:28.333
THAT'S WHAT RAN UP THOSE TOWERS,

43:28.400 --> 43:29.166
THOSE THREE HUNTERS SOMETHING

43:29.233 --> 43:31.800
MEN WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR

43:31.866 --> 43:32.266
OTHERS.

43:32.333 --> 43:36.500
THAT WAS HEROIC MASCULINITY AND

43:36.566 --> 43:37.333
THERE'S SOMETHING SICK AND

43:37.400 --> 43:39.100
POISONED THAT THIS IDEA THAT

43:39.166 --> 43:41.633
BOYS ARE BAD AND THEY HAVE TO BE

43:41.700 --> 43:42.766
WATCHED AND HAVE TO BE RETRAINED

43:42.833 --> 43:44.300
AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO

43:44.366 --> 43:46.466
BE WATCHING AND RETRAINING ARE

43:46.533 --> 43:47.966
WOMEN, THE PEOPLE WHO RAISE BOYS

43:48.033 --> 43:48.700
YOU NEED TO HAVE MEN VERY

43:48.766 --> 43:49.300
INVOLVED BECAUSE BOYS WANT TO

43:49.366 --> 43:53.233
GROW UP TO BE MEN.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.600
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO NOT BE

43:55.666 --> 43:56.133
IN A GOOD PLACE.

43:56.200 --> 44:01.533
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE TOXIC

44:01.600 --> 44:02.633
MASCULINITY, IF YOU WANT TO

44:02.700 --> 44:04.700
CREATE TOXIC MASCULINITY, TELL

44:04.766 --> 44:06.000
THESE BOYS FROM PRESCHOOL ON

44:06.066 --> 44:06.966
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

44:07.033 --> 44:08.733
WITH THEM AND THE THINGS THEY

44:08.800 --> 44:10.066
WANT TO DO ARE WRONG, THEY MIGHT

44:10.133 --> 44:11.100
BE RIGHT FOR THIS GIRL OVER HERE

44:11.166 --> 44:12.933
BUT FOR YOU THEY ARE WRONG AND

44:13.000 --> 44:14.500
THEY ARE DANGEROUS.

44:14.566 --> 44:15.600
AND A LOT OF PARENTS FEEL THIS

44:15.666 --> 44:18.266
WAY AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY

44:18.333 --> 44:20.400
TO CELEBRATE ALL THE DIVERSITY

44:20.466 --> 44:21.800
OF GENDERS AND SEXUAL

44:21.866 --> 44:22.600
EXPRESSION, ET CETERA, AND STILL

44:22.666 --> 44:23.733
SAY THERE IT IS A VERY LARGE

44:23.800 --> 44:27.433
NUMBER OF BOYS WHO ARE THIS WAY.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.600
>> Bill: SOME OF IT IS BAKED

44:28.666 --> 44:30.700
INTO THE CAKE OF US BEING MEN IS

44:30.766 --> 44:33.133
NOT GOOD TO BE PERFECT.

44:33.200 --> 44:38.800
I FEEL LIKE IT'S STILL SOMEWHAT

44:38.866 --> 44:41.700
POPULAR WITH WOMEN.

44:41.766 --> 44:41.966
[LAUGHTER]

44:42.033 --> 44:44.166
>> YOU TELL ME.

44:44.233 --> 44:46.166
>> WHERE BOTH PARENTS OF TWIN

44:46.233 --> 44:47.500
BOYS, WE BOTH HAVE TWIN BOYS IN

44:47.566 --> 44:49.800
THEIR 20s, I ALSO HAVE A

44:49.866 --> 44:51.100
DAUGHTER.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.766
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOCUSED ON

44:52.833 --> 44:54.800
AND RAISING OUR KIDS WAS GIVING

44:54.866 --> 44:57.100
THEM A MODEL THAT'S POSITIVE FOR

44:57.166 --> 45:01.400
HEROIC ADULTHOOD.

45:01.466 --> 45:03.600
IN CONGRESS, WHETHER IT'S

45:03.666 --> 45:06.166
SPEAKER PELOSI OR THE

45:06.233 --> 45:08.633
SENATOR FROM MARYLAND, TOUGH AS

45:08.700 --> 45:10.800
NAILS, CAPABLE, I WOULD SAY

45:10.866 --> 45:12.000
HEROIC ROLE MODELS.

45:12.066 --> 45:14.066
>> IDENTIFIED BOTH OF THEM AS

45:14.133 --> 45:14.900
WOMEN, DO YOU?

45:14.966 --> 45:16.466
I'M TALKING ABOUT MASCULINITY

45:16.533 --> 45:16.966
COMMITS A THING.

45:17.033 --> 45:18.300
WE'VE DECIDED IT'S NOT A THING,

45:18.366 --> 45:20.066
AND WE'VE DECIDED THERE'S NO

45:20.133 --> 45:21.900
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND

45:21.966 --> 45:24.033
WOMEN.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.366
SENATOR PELOSI, GOD LOVE HER,

45:25.433 --> 45:27.933
I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR HER TO

45:28.000 --> 45:30.866
COME UNDER THE BURNING BUILDING

45:30.933 --> 45:31.966
AND GET ME OUT.

45:32.033 --> 45:32.800
I'M AS STRONG A WOMAN AS YOUR

45:32.866 --> 45:35.566
EVER GOING TO GET WITHIN THE

45:35.633 --> 45:38.700
FEEBLE WORLD WHICH I WORK, BUT

45:38.766 --> 45:40.866
I'M STRONG, I KNOW A LOT OF

45:40.933 --> 45:42.133
EARLY TOUGH WOMEN, I KNOW A LOT

45:42.200 --> 45:44.033
OF WOMEN ARE HEROES, IT'S

45:44.100 --> 45:46.500
DIFFERENT TO BE A MAN.

45:46.566 --> 45:48.000
IT'S DIFFERENT, HEROIC

45:48.066 --> 45:48.766
MASCULINITY.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.133
THE UGLY TRUTH THAT NOBODY WANTS

45:50.200 --> 45:52.333
TO ADMIT IS MEN ARE STRONGER,

45:52.400 --> 45:54.066
THEY ARE BIGGER, THEY'RE FASTER,

45:54.133 --> 45:56.933
THEY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
SPATIAL OBJECTS WHICH IS WHY

45:58.066 --> 45:59.300
THEY BLOW US OUT OF THE WATER IN

45:59.366 --> 46:01.066
SPORTS AND WOMEN CAN'T KEEP UP.

46:01.133 --> 46:03.833
THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

46:03.900 --> 46:06.033
AS A GROUP, A LOT OF BOYS ARE

46:06.100 --> 46:07.700
SAYING WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL

46:07.766 --> 46:08.266
THIS?

46:08.333 --> 46:09.533
WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING FASTER

46:09.600 --> 46:12.133
AND STRONGER AND BIGGER, IT'S TO

46:12.200 --> 46:13.233
PROTECT INNOCENT PEOPLE.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.800
IT TO BE THAT PERSON WHO GOES

46:14.866 --> 46:15.400
INTO THE BURNING BUILDING.

46:15.466 --> 46:17.900
THAT'S WHAT I'M ALL ABOUT AND

46:17.966 --> 46:20.100
THERE'S PLENTY OF GREAT WOMEN

46:20.166 --> 46:22.633
FIREFIGHTERS, PLENTY OF GREAT

46:22.700 --> 46:22.966
WOMEN COPS.

46:23.033 --> 46:25.166
BUT NANCY PELOSI IS NOT AN

46:25.233 --> 46:25.800
EXAMPLE OF HEROIC MASCULINITY.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.466
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

46:27.533 --> 46:29.133
I WAS SAYING IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

46:29.200 --> 46:31.066
OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE POSITIVE

46:31.133 --> 46:32.700
EXAMPLES OF THE HEROIC, AND FOR

46:32.766 --> 46:35.500
YOUNG BOYS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO

46:35.566 --> 46:36.866
TREAT OTHERS RESPECTFULLY, AND

46:36.933 --> 46:39.033
HOW TO FEEL FULLY EMPOWERED TO

46:39.100 --> 46:40.666
BE HEROIC.

46:40.733 --> 46:41.933
>> IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

46:42.000 --> 46:44.133
HEROISM THAT YOU WOULD MODEL FOR

46:44.200 --> 46:45.733
YOUR SONS AND A PARTICULAR WAIT

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER?

46:46.866 --> 46:48.066
ARE YOU THINK HEROISM IS THE

46:48.133 --> 46:48.266
SAME?

46:48.333 --> 46:50.933
>> I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN

46:51.000 --> 46:52.833
QUALITIES, LOYALTY,

46:52.900 --> 46:53.533
DECISIVENESS, COMMITMENT,

46:53.600 --> 46:55.300
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RISKS,

46:55.366 --> 46:55.933
SERVICE TO OTHERS THAT ARE

46:56.000 --> 47:00.300
ADMIRABLE IN MEN AND WOMEN.

47:00.366 --> 47:01.666
MY BOYS WRESTLED AND PLAYED

47:01.733 --> 47:02.700
FOOTBALL AND PLAYED LACROSSE AND

47:02.766 --> 47:04.833
I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM.

47:04.900 --> 47:06.500
BUT WE ALSO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND

47:06.566 --> 47:08.333
HOW TO TREAT OTHERS WITH

47:08.400 --> 47:11.033
RESPECT, HOW TO BE POSITIVE.

47:11.100 --> 47:12.066
>> Bill: I HAVE TO

47:12.133 --> 47:14.733
RESPECTFULLY AND NOT GET THERE,

47:14.800 --> 47:17.966
YOU VERY MUCH.

47:18.033 --> 47:19.000
TIME FOR NEW RULES, EVERYBODY,

47:19.066 --> 47:21.366
NEW RULES.

47:21.433 --> 47:24.633
NEW RULE: THE BRITISH ACTIVIST

47:24.700 --> 47:26.066
WHO SET UP THIS PROTEST OUTSIDE

47:26.133 --> 47:27.266
DOWNING STREET AFTER PARLIAMENT

47:27.333 --> 47:29.733
VOTED AGAINST AN ENVIRONMENT

47:29.800 --> 47:34.600
BILL, NEEDS TO BE MORE DIRECT.

47:34.666 --> 47:34.866
[LAUGHTER]

47:34.933 --> 47:36.000
PEOPLE DON'T SEE THIS AND THINK

47:36.066 --> 47:36.833
YOU'RE AN ACTIVIST AND YOU'RE

47:36.900 --> 47:37.666
STRIKING A BLOW FOR THE

47:37.733 --> 47:40.033
ENVIRONMENT.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.266
THEY THINK YOU'RE UNION AND

47:42.333 --> 47:47.033
YOU'RE ON A BREAK.

47:47.100 --> 47:47.800
[LAUGHTER]

47:47.866 --> 47:48.066
[APPLAUSE]

47:48.133 --> 47:49.366
NEW RULE: LET'S ADMIT THAT A

47:49.433 --> 47:50.933
"BOMB CYCLONE" IS JUST CABLE

47:51.000 --> 47:57.600
NEWS' WAY OF SAYING "A STORM."

47:57.666 --> 47:57.866
[LAUGHTER]

47:57.933 --> 47:58.733
[APPLAUSE]

47:58.800 --> 47:59.700
THE SAME WAY "THE TOYOTATHON

47:59.766 --> 48:00.566
SALES EVENT!"

48:00.633 --> 48:01.966
IS TOYOTA'S WAY OF SAYING "YOU

48:02.033 --> 48:02.800
CAN BUY OUR CARS AT THE SAME

48:02.866 --> 48:03.400
PRICE AS YOU WOULD ANY OTHER

48:03.466 --> 48:09.066
TIME OF THE YEAR."

48:09.133 --> 48:09.333
[LAUGHTER]

48:09.400 --> 48:12.933
[APPLAUSE]

48:13.000 --> 48:14.300
NEW RULE: WHOEVER KEEPS WRITING

48:14.366 --> 48:16.733
THOSE ARTICLES TELLING US WE'RE

48:16.800 --> 48:18.933
DOING EVERYTHING WRONG,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.233
INCLUDING THIS ONE THAT SAYS

48:21.300 --> 48:21.866
WE'RE WALKING WRONG -- YOU HAVE

48:21.933 --> 48:26.466
TO SHOW YOURSELF.

48:26.533 --> 48:27.366
THAT WAY WE CAN WRITE ABOUT YOU

48:27.433 --> 48:28.366
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING WRONG,

48:28.433 --> 48:29.266
LIKE, "YOU'RE PROBABLY

48:29.333 --> 48:30.200
CONTRIBUTING TO THE FIELD OF

48:30.266 --> 48:33.000
JOURNALISM WRONG -- HERE'S HOW

48:33.066 --> 48:44.066
TO FIX IT."

48:44.133 --> 48:51.800
AND "GO FUCKING YOURSELF --

48:51.866 --> 48:55.333
YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!

48:55.400 --> 48:56.600
NEW RULE: SOMEONE HAS TO

48:56.666 --> 48:57.433
TELL THE WOMEN WHO BUY THIS SEXY

48:57.500 --> 48:58.166
VACCINE COSTUME, WHICH CONSISTS

48:58.233 --> 48:59.300
OF A WET-LOOK MINI DRESS AND A

48:59.366 --> 49:00.300
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE STICKING OUT

49:00.366 --> 49:01.733
OF YOUR HEAD, IT DOESN'T LOOK

49:01.800 --> 49:02.300
SEXY OR LIKE A VACCINE.

49:02.366 --> 49:03.300
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

49:03.366 --> 49:10.133
SWIMMING AT VENICE BEACH.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.533
[LAUGHTER]

49:12.600 --> 49:15.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:15.200 --> 49:15.766
NEW RULE: NOW THAT MEGAN THEE

49:15.833 --> 49:18.100
STALLION HAS POSTED THIS PHOTO

49:18.166 --> 49:20.033
OF HER BOYFRIEND DRINKING FROM A

49:20.100 --> 49:21.500
GLASS WEDGED IN HER ASS, LET'S

49:21.566 --> 49:23.100
NOT MAKE THIS A THING AT

49:23.166 --> 49:28.500
HOULIHAN'S.

49:28.566 --> 49:29.300
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT PHOTO, IT'S

49:29.366 --> 49:31.833
VERY UNSANITARY -- HE'S NOT

49:31.900 --> 49:36.566
WEARING A MASK!

49:36.633 --> 49:36.833
[LAUGHTER]

49:36.900 --> 49:37.666
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

49:37.733 --> 49:38.866
INSTEAD OF PUTTING A BIBLE IN

49:38.933 --> 49:39.900
HOTEL ROOMS, WE SHOULD START

49:39.966 --> 49:48.800
PUTTING A DICTIONARY IN THERE.

49:48.866 --> 49:49.266
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:49.333 --> 49:50.033
BECAUSE APPARENTLY NOBODY KNOWS

49:50.100 --> 49:51.566
WHAT WORDS MEAN ANYMORE.

49:51.633 --> 49:53.733
GEORGE CARLIN FAMOUSLY HAD THE

49:53.800 --> 49:59.566
SEVEN WORDS YOU CAN'T SAY ON TV

49:59.633 --> 50:00.266
