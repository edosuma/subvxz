00:05.405 --> 00:06.740
{\an7}I got a booking
out in Dubai.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.241
{\an8}What?

00:06.806 --> 00:08.241
{\an8}Yes, honey.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.709
{\an7}So I'm finna go out there
for the weekend

00:09.776 --> 00:11.044
{\an8}and go make this coin.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.413
{\an8}That is absolutely nuts.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.248
{\an7}Once I even heard wind
of your name,

00:16.315 --> 00:17.751
{\an7}the child support thing
came up.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.019
{\an7}You don't know me
to question my relationships.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.923
{\an7}I apologize that you didn't know
about the Nas situation

00:23.990 --> 00:25.925
{\an8}before we walked in there.
My bad.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.061
{\an7}I can't do nothing
with a sorry.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.496
{\an8}I said I'm sorry
about what I did.

00:29.562 --> 00:33.032
{\an8}You can't accept that, then
get the (bleep) out my face.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.601
{\an8}You janky as (bleep).

00:34.667 --> 00:36.603
{\an8}You're shady as (bleep).

00:36.669 --> 00:38.338
{\an8}You're not real with nobody.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.338
{\an8}You tried to infiltrate me
and Princess' relationship

00:38.405 --> 00:40.273
{\an8}'cause you can't be with me.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.273
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.841
{\an8}Have you been in contact
with Ray?

00:41.908 --> 00:43.476
{\an8}Yeah, I sent him
a text message.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.745
{\an8}You're a (bleep)-up person.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.745
{\an8}I'm a (bleep)-up person?

00:45.812 --> 00:47.614
{\an8}You're a (bleep)-up person.
You're unloyal to everybody.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.614
{\an4}Oh.

00:50.116 --> 00:53.653
{\an7}I've had feelings of attraction
towards the same sex.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.388

in a relationship.

00:55.455 --> 00:56.923

{\an8}His friend Milan,
who is gay, too.

Ever since Miles
has told me this news,

01:51.544 --> 01:54.047
{\an8}I've been staying really close
to my family and friends,

01:54.113 --> 01:55.682
talking to my sisters,

01:55.748 --> 01:58.218
and trying to put all these
(bleep) pieces together.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.554
{\an1}It's like if, you know,
that is your sexual preference,

02:01.621 --> 02:04.290
I cannot get mad that
you're attracted to men.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.992
At least he did tell you.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.327
And like you've
always said,

02:07.393 --> 02:09.662
{\an5}it's always been
something about him.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.662
Always.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.397
{\an1}Like, I'm sitting back
and I'm reflecting on everything

02:11.464 --> 02:13.900
{\an4}and, like,
all the signs were there.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.900
Yeah.

Miles and Milan hanging out

02:15.468 --> 02:17.403
was one thing
I never questioned.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.073
But knowing what I know
about Miles now,

02:20.139 --> 02:22.809
it's obviously
more to the story.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.778
Miles-- I think I need to call
him and ask him some questions

02:25.845 --> 02:27.514
because I need to know
what's going on.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.482

02:35.922 --> 02:37.757
you had some things
to tell me,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.292
{\an8}so I'm ready to listen

02:39.359 --> 02:40.927
{\an7}when you're ready
to go ahead and let me know

02:40.994 --> 02:42.762
what the (bleep) else
you have to tell me,

02:42.829 --> 02:44.163
'cause I have a clue.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.665
So I'll wait.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.436

02:50.503 --> 02:51.905

So, what?
Um, what?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.442
<i>I've been with Milan.</i>

02:59.779 --> 03:01.514
What does he mean?
He's been with him, like, what?

03:01.581 --> 03:02.549
You've been with Milan?

03:02.615 --> 03:04.117
Oh, what do you mean
been with him?

03:04.183 --> 03:07.287

<i>I'm still figuring</i>
<i>this (bleep) out, like...</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:24.137
I got a question.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.706
{\an1}So at Stacy's house,
what else was you gonna tell me?

03:26.773 --> 03:29.375
And I want you to tell me
right now on the phone.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.978
{\an1}'Cause if you don't (bleep)
tell me that, I will--

03:32.045 --> 03:34.614
I will call Milan
right now

03:34.681 --> 03:37.750
{\an1}and I will get the information
for my (bleep) self.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.153
So right now, you need to
really be honest with me.

03:40.219 --> 03:43.323
{\an1}Because if I'm not satisfied
with these answers,

03:43.389 --> 03:46.159
{\an1}I'm gonna go ahead and take
the matters into my own hands.

03:46.225 --> 03:47.927
And you already know
how that's gonna end up.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.762
But that's on you.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.764
I'll wait.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.969
{\an5}Hello?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.969
<i>Um...</i>

03:56.035 --> 03:58.371

04:00.006 --> 04:03.676
<i>I have been</i>

04:03.743 --> 04:05.845

04:08.681 --> 04:09.916
(Amber)
I feel so betrayed.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.851
Like this is some
(bleep) bad dream.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.686
Miles told me
at the therapist's house

04:13.753 --> 04:15.288
that he was
in a relationship.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.956
But there's a big
(bleep) difference

04:17.023 --> 04:18.791
between being
in a relationship

04:18.858 --> 04:21.293
and being in a relationship
with Milan.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.464
We both know him and we both
been out with him together.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.867
I'm so done with you,
it's ridiculous.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.770
Right now,
I (bleep) hate Milan.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.305
And guess what?

04:32.372 --> 04:33.906
It's three sides
to a story.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.476

let you know right now,

08:10.690 --> 08:12.124
{\an5}Okay, yeah, let's do that.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.124
{\an1}All right.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.426
{\an5}(Nikki)
A group of her friends
are gathering around

08:13.492 --> 08:15.361
to lend her some support.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.998
{\an8}Because I heard it
was really bad and I really
don't know what to expect.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.701
{\an8}Hey.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.701
{\an8}T.T. Haze, how are you, baby?

08:21.767 --> 08:24.003
{\an8}Aww, thank you.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.003
{\an8}How are you feeling?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.938
{\an8}I'm surviving.
I'm alive.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.874
{\an5}I'm so happy you're doing okay.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.874
{\an3}Thank you.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.942
{\an1}You're not that bruised,
you know?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.144
I mean, we gotta see
when it come off,

08:32.211 --> 08:33.913
what the result's
gonna be.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.381
{\an3}They, um...

08:35.448 --> 08:37.717
out the--
out the gate, see,

08:37.783 --> 08:40.553
it went in,
all the way through.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.154
What happened, exactly?

08:42.221 --> 08:44.891
I was out in Dubai,
riding around,

08:44.957 --> 08:47.193
{\an1}getting it turned up,
think I'm princess of Dubai,

08:47.260 --> 08:49.528
{\an5}you know, I was out there.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.528
Right.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.430
And my ass thought
I was just,

08:51.497 --> 08:54.033
like, making a turn,
trying to get away.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.736
{\an5}Boom, straight,
dead off a cliff.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.736
Right in the ditch.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.871
Right into the handlebars.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.641
And I, like, blacked out
for a little second,

09:01.707 --> 09:03.509
but, like, I feel
my nose is mush.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.379
{\an1}All they can do is put ice on it
'til they could get a vehicle.

09:06.445 --> 09:09.348
{\an1}'Cause we're an hour
and a half outside of Dubai.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.417
We had to go into
a CAT scan

09:11.484 --> 09:12.785
'cause they wanted to see
the head trauma

09:12.852 --> 09:14.387
and what was actually,
like, broken.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.022
So that's when
the doctor says,

09:16.088 --> 09:19.992
{\an1}"We have 48 hours to get to
America to save her nose.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.694
If not,
her nose is dead."

09:21.761 --> 09:24.130
{\an4}Wow.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.130
So it was 16 hours
that I had to fly

09:24.196 --> 09:27.300
with a concussion
and a bloody broken nose.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.969
I was in an IV
and was out four hours

09:30.036 --> 09:32.638
and they saved my nose.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.840
{\an7}That's crazy, 'cause on
the blogs, when I found out,

09:34.907 --> 09:38.678
{\an7}it was like, you was trying to
cover up getting a nose job.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.179
{\an8}Right.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.179
{\an7}I'm like,
"She would never do that."

09:40.246 --> 09:42.481
{\an8}Who would go to Dubai
to get a nose job?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.481
{\an6}Right.

09:42.548 --> 09:45.284
{\an1}I'm too real to go and have
to fake a near-death accident

09:45.351 --> 09:47.219
{\an5}to get a nose job.

09:45.351 --> 09:47.219
Yeah.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.555
And the things that,
like, hurt me the most

09:49.622 --> 09:53.359
was, like, the people
that I was there with,

09:53.426 --> 09:56.429
it was like, no compassion,
like, nobody held my hand,

09:56.495 --> 09:58.831
nobody was like,
you gonna be okay.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.967
I look like
a (bleep) monster.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.601
{\an5}Haze, come on.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.601
I can't cry--

10:02.668 --> 10:03.769
You don't look like
a monster, but--

10:03.836 --> 10:05.805
{\an5}Like, I do, like...

10:03.836 --> 10:05.805
No, you don't.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.506
{\an5}No, you don't.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.506
My whole face is--

10:07.573 --> 10:10.309
{\an1}This is how we make our money,
you know what I'm saying?

10:10.376 --> 10:11.477
(Milan)
But you're gonna be fine.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.578
{\an1}Haze, listen to me,
you're gonna be fine.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.013
(Hazel-E)
I almost died out there.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.215
And I know I'm still in shock,
but I can't seem to stop

10:16.282 --> 10:18.684
thinking about how this is
gonna affect my career.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.087
In Hollywood,
it's all about how you look

10:21.153 --> 10:23.322
and nobody is more aware
of that than me.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.958
It's so hurtful
that people in the blogs

10:26.025 --> 10:27.860
believe everything
that they hear

10:27.927 --> 10:29.795
or that they read
in social media,

10:29.862 --> 10:31.230
even if it's not true.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.699
{\an1}We all know my insecurities
about my nose.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.635
How much on social media
they call me ugly.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.637
I look like
"Ernest Goes to Jail."

10:38.704 --> 10:41.540
{\an1}My nose was a trending topic
for four weeks, like...

10:41.607 --> 10:44.377
{\an5}You can't read into that.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.377
{\an1}Not even at all.
They say all types of (bleep).

10:44.443 --> 10:46.879
She's plastic, I'm fat,
you ugly, like, come on.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.948
They say I look like a man,
I'm Michael Jackson's sister.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.916
Girl, you cannot read
that stuff.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.185
{\an1}That stuff will destroy
you as a person.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.987
{\an1}It's just people who
don't have, like, no lives.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.155
{\an1}Just trying to just
bring you down.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.990
{\an1}You just can't even feed
into that energy.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.759
I already wanted
a new nose.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.528
I didn't think it was
my time for it yet.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.430

God had another plan.

There was a time when I would
have let Marla have it,

11:36.162 --> 11:38.431
{\an8}but I've grown up
just a little bit

11:38.497 --> 11:41.200
{\an8}and I think now it's time for me
to look at this Marla situation

11:41.267 --> 11:42.601
in the big picture.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.236
{\an5}Hello. How are you?

{\an1}Hey, Rich.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.704
Let me start again.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.074
{\an8}My last meeting with Rich,
it really didn't go well.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.276
{\an8}And I could have really handled
that situation with Rich

11:50.342 --> 11:51.944
{\an8}with way more grace

11:52.011 --> 11:54.814
and not judge him
for his mistakes

11:54.880 --> 11:57.450
because he's now
in our lives.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.752
I want to offer you
my sincere apology.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.555
{\an1}I came at you in a way
that comes from protection.

12:02.621 --> 12:06.058
{\an1}Um, I don't know if I'm
protecting you from Moniece

12:06.125 --> 12:07.793
or Moniece from you.

12:07.860 --> 12:11.263
First of all, I'm a big boy
and I don't need protecting

12:11.330 --> 12:12.565
from the woman I'm with.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.100
But second,

12:14.166 --> 12:16.535
why is this woman trying to
scare me away from her daughter?

12:16.602 --> 12:18.104
Either you're trying to
get rid of me

12:18.170 --> 12:20.906
or there's really something
that I should be scared of.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.842
And that freaks me
the (bleep) out.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.345
I don't know what it's gonna
mean to you in the long run,

12:26.412 --> 12:28.247
knowing that Moniece
can be temperamental.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.248
{\an1}But that's what
I want to ask you.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.282
How can I help you?

12:30.349 --> 12:32.585
Y'all could be friends.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.054
I mean, like,
one of her main issues

12:35.121 --> 12:37.490
{\an1}that she comes to me all the
time, it's her custody (bleep).

12:37.556 --> 12:38.891
And it's the cust--
and, you know--

12:38.958 --> 12:39.992
And I don't know Fizz,
so I don't--

12:40.059 --> 12:41.594

If Rich has any hopes of
making it work with Moniece,

12:44.396 --> 12:47.333
he's got to know
what he's getting going in.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.468
If Rich can love Moniece,

12:49.535 --> 12:51.504
once all the cards
have been dealt,

12:51.570 --> 12:53.405
then they've got a shot.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.274
{\an1}First of all,
when Moniece was angry,

12:55.341 --> 12:56.408
when the baby was young,

12:56.475 --> 12:58.110
the reason that
it all blew up

12:58.177 --> 13:00.446
is because she told Drew
to come pick the baby up.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.481
She came down,
it got verbal.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.183
{\an4}He just said,
"I'm just here
to pick up my son.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.251
{\an1}I just wanna
pick up my son."

13:05.317 --> 13:07.019
{\an1}He was fanning
all the verbal blows,

13:07.086 --> 13:09.221
{\an1}and they were coming
like AK-47.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.756
{\an1}And when the police
walked up,

13:10.823 --> 13:13.926
Moniece was so enraged
that the officer said,

13:13.993 --> 13:16.529
she's clearly the aggressor and
booked her and took her to jail.

13:16.595 --> 13:20.366
{\an1}And because of that,
Rich, Fizz has custody.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.234
That's not how the story
was given to me.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.003
{\an5}(Rich)
Now, Moniece's version
of the events

13:24.069 --> 13:25.371
are a little bit different.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.505
From what I heard,

13:26.572 --> 13:27.940
when Marla talked
to the police,

13:28.007 --> 13:30.676
she took Fizz' side,
and that's pretty (bleep) up.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.946
{\an1}The truth is grounded in facts,
not what we feel.

13:34.013 --> 13:37.116
{\an6}Everything.

13:34.013 --> 13:37.116
{\an1}So sometimes what Moniece feels
is true to her feelings,

13:37.183 --> 13:39.351
{\an1}but the details
are not accurate.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.786
{\an1}Do you understand that,
basically,

13:40.853 --> 13:44.323
{\an1}this is gonna be a very
complicated love relationship.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.658
{\an6}I'm aware.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.658
{\an1}Okay.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.226
{\an1}I feel better 'cause I didn't
want you to be blind.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.561
All I can do is try.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.664
{\an1}Okay, so you are in for

anything as far as a nose job.

{\an5}It's ridiculous, bro.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.504
Right, damn.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.405
{\an4}You know,
for three weekends straight,
she hasn't been with him.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.875
Fizz is the definition of
a real man.

23:29.941 --> 23:31.710
He take care of
his responsibilities,

23:31.777 --> 23:33.378
he makes sure Kam is cool.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.147
That's just the type
of person that he is.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.649
And as a parent,
I respect that so much.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.084
I look up to that.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.852
Because, you know,

23:40.919 --> 23:43.355
there's a lot of parents
out here that don't do that.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.758
{\an4}What you doing is
what a man should be doing,
you know what I'm saying?

{\an4}You're handling
your responsibilities.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.994
{\an3}Right.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.396
So when stuff like that has
happened, I'm just thinking,

23:51.463 --> 23:53.231
{\an1}like, man, I hope Kam
don't have to pay for that.

23:53.298 --> 23:56.067
{\an5}I gotta figure it out,
bro, 'cause this--
it's becoming ridiculous.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.436
So maybe I should
go holler at her moms.

23:58.503 --> 24:00.839
{\an1}Because, you know, her mother
knows how to talk to her.

24:00.906 --> 24:04.609
{\an5}Or making-- talk some sense into
her or whatever the case may be.

24:00.906 --> 24:04.609
{\an1}Right.

24:04.676 --> 24:05.944
'Cause I don't want
nothing more than Kam

24:06.011 --> 24:07.946
{\an5}to be able to spend time
with his mom, bro.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.946

24:08.013 --> 24:09.447

36:25.249 --> 36:26.417
I'm not cursing at you.

36:26.484 --> 36:28.319
I'm saying, this is

36:28.386 --> 36:31.455
{\an4}Nobody came here

36:28.386 --> 36:31.455
That's how you came in.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.758
{\an1}I came here to simply have
a regular conversation with you

36:33.824 --> 36:36.694
about what's been
going on on my end

36:36.761 --> 36:40.498

36:40.565 --> 36:41.799
I don't need--
I just need--

36:41.866 --> 36:43.701
I had a conversation with
your mom the other day--

36:43.768 --> 36:45.036
I don't care
about my mom.

36:45.102 --> 36:46.938
I'm sitting here trying to
figure out how to help you

{\an1}get your supporting cast
back behind you.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.143
{\an1}Because right now, Kameron is
the one that's taking the loss.

36:52.209 --> 36:55.079
It makes me so angry
that my mom and Drew

36:55.146 --> 36:57.982
are talking behind my back--
let alone talking at all.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.751
And I feel like they're trying
to make decisions about my son

37:00.818 --> 37:04.522
{\an5}without involving me
and giving me the respect
I deserve as his mother.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.223
The way I react now

37:06.290 --> 37:08.292
is based off of the way
that I have been treated

37:08.359 --> 37:09.827
for the past
three and a half years.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.230
This is the first time since the
child has taken his first breath

37:13.297 --> 37:16.400
{\an4}that you've asked me what
I needed, how you can help.

37:13.297 --> 37:16.400
Because I have now--

37:16.467 --> 37:18.502
{\an5}'Cause you don't care.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.502
No. No, that's not true.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.137
{\an5}And that's how I feel.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.137
That's not true, Moniece.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.773
{\an5}I feel like no one cares.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.773
Okay, listen, listen, come here.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.308
{\an5}No one cares.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.308
{\an1}Come here.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.544
{\an5}No one cares, ever.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.544
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.347
{\an1}Come here, come here, stop it.
Stop it, stop it.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.882
{\an5}Because if it's anybody--

37:29.413 --> 37:31.882
You don't care!

37:31.949 --> 37:34.185
{\an5}You don't care!

37:31.949 --> 37:34.185
Stop it, stop it!

37:34.251 --> 37:36.854
{\an5}You have never cared!

37:34.251 --> 37:36.854
Oh, my God, yo, stop it.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.789
Stop it.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.891
{\an1}'Cause anybody that cared,
it was me.

37:40.958 --> 37:44.795
{\an1}Because I've always been trying
to keep our son-- period.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.031
{\an1}But not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

37:47.098 --> 37:49.700
{\an1}to know that you did not
have a support system.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.302
{\an1}You have to
understand this.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.837
Like, seriously.

37:52.903 --> 37:55.973
{\an1}Your mom told me yesterday
to take you to court.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.542
{\an1}You know how much
we went through court

37:58.609 --> 38:01.045
{\an1}and we said that we would
never do that (bleep) again?

38:01.112 --> 38:02.980
{\an1}You're attacking me
and I'm the one

38:03.047 --> 38:04.649
{\an1}that's been helping
all this time.

38:04.715 --> 38:07.251
{\an5}(Moniece)
I'd like to be able to say
that I can't believe

38:07.318 --> 38:10.388
{\an5}that my own mother
would tell Drew to take
my son away from me,

38:10.454 --> 38:11.622
but I do.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.257
And hearing it yet again

38:13.324 --> 38:15.760
makes me feel like I'm always
gonna be fighting on my own.

38:15.826 --> 38:18.462
{\an1}This is how we fall out and this
is why (bleep) doesn't work.

38:18.529 --> 38:21.132
{\an1}We have to learn to communicate
on a positive level

38:21.198 --> 38:25.002
{\an1}that deals with just Kameron
and it's healthy.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.304
I love you and I know
that Kameron loves you

38:27.371 --> 38:30.708
{\an1}and I need you to figure
this out, Moniece, seriously.

38:30.775 --> 38:31.876
All right?

38:31.942 --> 38:33.344
{\an1}I don't know
if it takes therapy

38:33.411 --> 38:35.079
{\an1}or whatever
the (bleep) it takes,

38:35.146 --> 38:38.382
{\an4}but you gotta figure it out
and you gotta know that
you got my support.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.384
Thank you.

Since Miles told me about Milan,

38:55.466 --> 38:57.201
{\an8}that's all I can think about.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.803
I have so many questions

38:58.869 --> 39:02.006
and I'm sure Miles won't
give me any straight answers.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.808
I deserve the truth

39:03.874 --> 39:06.844
and I asked Milan if we can
meet up and he said yes.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.580
It's about time
I come face-to-face

39:09.647 --> 39:11.482
with the little boy
who's with the man

39:11.549 --> 39:14.285

So I've always wanted to

{\an8}ever since Miles
and I got together.

39:21.826 --> 39:24.428
{\an8}Her continuation to be
a big part of his life

39:24.495 --> 39:26.130
{\an8}has always been
a problem for me.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.631
And if Miles and I
want to have a future

39:27.698 --> 39:28.933
and have a relationship,

39:28.999 --> 39:30.534
she's gonna have to be
left in the past.

39:30.601 --> 39:31.936
And I'm gonna let her
know that.

{\an8}We have matching tattoos.

{\an8}You know, he live--
he moved into my house.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.725
{\an8}He wants to be with me,
he wants to marry me.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.494
{\an8}He's not in love with you,
he's in love with me.

{\an8}What mother tells their

{\an7}I've been your

40:05.136 --> 40:07.338
{\an7}We try to be there
for you.

40:07.404 --> 40:08.839
{\an7}So it's preposterous
for you to think

40:08.906 --> 40:11.375
{\an7}that I would gang up
with Drew against you.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.178
{\an8}You were supposed to go
handle your business

40:14.245 --> 40:16.947
{\an8}and get yourself out of
the situation with Harry.

40:17.014 --> 40:18.682
{\an7}It didn't happen,
but that's why I called you.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.018
{\an8}I can't really help you.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.021
{\an8}(Teairra) I'm getting lipo.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.021
{\an8}(Nikki) Our fashion show's
in two weeks.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.856
{\an7}Do you think
you're gonna be ready to go?

40:25.923 --> 40:29.193
{\an7}I feel like I just
let a bus run me over.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.229
{\an7}I'm just a little worried
'cause we have so much stuff
to get done.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.565
{\an7}I mean, you gotta do what's best
for you at the end of the day.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.568
{\an9}I'm sorry.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.568
{\an7}All right.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.036
{\an7}And I want you to understand
why I told you.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.036
{\an4}Okay.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.405
{\an8}I never wanna lose you, ever.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.405
{\an8}Okay, yeah, we're friends.

40:41.472 --> 40:42.873
{\an8}I don't hate you.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.408
{\an8}I just don't (bleep)
