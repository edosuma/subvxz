00:04.704 --> 00:07.874
- OMG, look at
this little munchkin.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.075
- Oh, hey, Mrs. Band.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.877
- This is so cute
I'm gonna barf.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.812
- I'm trying to help my Mom
pay her electric bill.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.147
I need $100.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.915
- He's got a hook,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.351
Wow, you marketing genius.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.186
Well, how much have
you made so far?

00:20.253 --> 00:21.821
- Zilch.
You're my first customer.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.524
- "Zilch," he says.
This kid with the lingo.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.192
Look at you.

00:26.259 --> 00:28.328
You're adorable,
you're hilarious,

00:28.395 --> 00:30.764
and you've got an eye
for business.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.866
- I rarely get this much
positive feedback.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.601
- Well, maybe you found
your calling.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.104
I am honored to give you
your very first dollar.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.373
- Thank you so much.
Do you want a large or a small?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.108
- You know what?
I don't even want the lemonade.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.011
That's how much I believe
in you, you cutie patootie.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.346
- This is literally
the best interaction

00:46.413 --> 00:47.781
I've ever had with a person.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.283
- Get used to it, hun.
You're going to the top.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.920
- I really found my calling.
Finally nailing it.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.290
- Tombo.
- Oh, hey, Rick, the neighbor.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.725
- What do you got going on,
buddy?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.460
The old lemonade stand, huh?
- Yeah.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.062
You know, everyone seems
pretty impressed.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.530
- Really?

01:03.596 --> 01:05.231
Tom, do you know what the word
"patronizing" means?

01:05.298 --> 01:07.567
- No, it doesn't sound good.
- No, it's not good.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.236
In the real world,
you would get slaughtered.

01:10.303 --> 01:11.538
- Slaughtered?

01:11.604 --> 01:13.206
- They would tear you
a new a-hole.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.974
- Mo--most people would
have been more encouraging.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.043
- Most people are idiots, Tom.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.312
I'm in advertising, okay?
I make a lot of money.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.247
- Okay.
- I bang a lot of chicks.

01:21.314 --> 01:24.951
And I've literally got Clio
Awards coming out of my butt.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.486
Tell me, do me a favor
and just check.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.288
- Check what?
- Whoops. Oh, what was that?

01:28.388 --> 01:30.423
Did another Clio Award
just come out of my butt?

01:30.490 --> 01:31.891
'Cause I've got too many.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.626
- You carry one with you
just to make that joke?

01:33.726 --> 01:36.963
- Tom, why don't you
come into my agency one day?

01:37.063 --> 01:40.834
I will have my team give you
the tips on the lemonade stand

01:40.934 --> 01:42.335
like you were a real client.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.570
Does that sound fun?

01:43.636 --> 01:45.105
- I mean, fun is a strong word.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.006
I could use the help, though.
I'll ask my mom.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.475
- Okay, great. You know what?
First, let's take a pic.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.076
Ready?
Rick pic if you will.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.311
- Rick pic?
- Say,

01:51.411 --> 01:52.812
"My lemonade stand
sucked balls

01:52.912 --> 01:54.481
until Rick swooped in
and saved the day."

01:54.581 --> 01:55.915
- I'm not gonna say that.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.617
- I love mentoring kids.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.419
There's--you know, there's
no better feeling in the world.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.565
- Guys, tiny little Tom here
is my neighbor's kid

02:45.665 --> 02:47.300
and I promised
that we would help him.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.335
So let's treat him
like a real client, okay?

02:49.402 --> 02:51.237
- Happy to have you, Tom.
Welcome.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.906
- Jerry, please shut up.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.408
Little Tommy, Margaret here
is our star creative director.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.810
Mags, give Tom
your first impressions.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.079
- Well, your table's great.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.315
And the name is fun.
- Thank you.

03:02.382 --> 03:05.852
- The only part I struggle with
is right here.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.588
- The Tom part?
- You got it, the Tom part.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.092
You have a face that screams
"I make bad lemonade."

03:13.193 --> 03:14.661
- Bad lemonade?
- It says,

03:14.727 --> 03:16.196
"I'm making
an inferior product

03:16.262 --> 03:17.430
and I don't really care."

03:17.530 --> 03:19.199
- Thanks, Jerry. I got this.
- Sorry.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.667
- Just to be clear,

03:20.733 --> 03:22.335
you guys are doing this
to be nice or mean?

03:22.402 --> 03:23.937
- Guys, flag on the play,
let me step in here.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.172
Jerry, dim the lights
and grab me a cookie.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.774
- Sure thing, boss.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.010
- Tom, what is lemonade?

03:31.077 --> 03:33.112
Don't answer, please.
Thank you.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.916
Is it just a beverage
or is it so much more?

03:37.016 --> 03:40.954
Maybe it's a reminder
of a simpler time.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.590
Lightning bugs.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.959
Putting a card in the spoke
of the wheels of your bike.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.029
A time when neighbors
knew each other by name.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.966
And the sound
of children's laughter

03:53.066 --> 03:54.300
wafted through the air.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.970
- So true.
- Damn it, Jerry, please.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.037
Not when I'm going.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.606
- Oh, sorry.

03:59.706 --> 04:03.710
- Tom, you need to offer people
a window to that time.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.212
Like a comforting voice
that says,

04:06.279 --> 04:08.481
"It's going to be okay."

04:08.581 --> 04:12.986
What you need is an old man.

04:14.721 --> 04:15.822
- Yes. Love it.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.757
- Jerry like-y that.
- Old man.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.560
That's the whole--that's
the whole idea? You're done?

04:20.627 --> 04:22.161
- Tom, this is what we do
for a living.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.831
Now, normally, we would charge
$100,000 for that.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.967
Great meeting, guys.
Really good.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.302
- Thanks for doing this,
Grandpa.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.603
I really appreciate
you helping out.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.672
- Oh, thank you
for including me.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.641
This is gonna be so much fun.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.175
- Just be yourself,
chat people up.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.578
Our brand is all about
the simpler times.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.680
- It's my strong suit.
- Hey, Ms. Munoz.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.182
- Hello. What's this?
A new employee?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.351
- This is my adorable grandpa.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.321
- So nice to meet you.
- Let me tell you a story.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.356
- Okay.
- I had a lemonade stand

04:50.456 --> 04:53.626
on this very block
back in 1960.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.161
I charged a nickel.

04:55.261 --> 04:56.929
- Mm.
- My slogan was,

04:56.996 --> 05:00.867
"I like Ike,
and you will like my lemonade."

05:00.967 --> 05:02.168
- I love it.

05:02.268 --> 05:03.536
What a great story.
- That's folky.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.171
That's folksy stuff
right there.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.707
- Give me two cups.
- Wow, it's actually working.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.109
We're up to $10.
$90 to go.

05:10.176 --> 05:13.279
- Denise, isn't this the cutest
lemonade stand ever?

05:13.346 --> 05:16.316
- It's so sweet.
I'm putting this on Instagram.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.618
- I once dated
a girl named Denise.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.720
High school sweetheart.
- Oh.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.523
- Had a caboose on her
that wouldn't quit.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.892
Just like you.
Ho-ho-ho.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.060
- Did you just
touch my rear end?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.661
- Wait, what?
- Oh, no.

05:28.728 --> 05:31.197
I was just jabbering on
about my old sweetheart.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.232
- Oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, I saw it.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.635
He grabbed her rear end
and squeezed it.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.236
What the hell, Tom?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.705
- He's just being folksy.
He's being folksy.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.340
It's like--like
in the good old days.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.708
-
The good old days when people

05:41.808 --> 05:43.743
just molested each other
on the street?

05:43.843 --> 05:45.144
- It's a compliment.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.813
"A caboose that won't quit"
is a good thing.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.915
- Grandpa. Stop saying caboose.
- You know what?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.416
Don't stop.
Don't stop what you're doing.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.085
The world is watching you,
old man, so--

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
- Please don't record anything.
- What's going on?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.488
- Oh, we see you.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.724
- Why are all these broads
recording me?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.425
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, we "broads" now.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.927
Okay.
- All right. You know what?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.762
We're--we're gonna close up
for the day.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.831
All sold out,
swing on back tomorrow.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.666
- Wait, wait, wait.
I'm confused.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.034
Did he say caboose

06:08.101 --> 06:09.235
or did he actually touch
someone's caboose?

06:09.335 --> 06:11.204
- He said caboose,
then he--

06:11.270 --> 06:13.773
he did a full palm grab
of a woman's rear end.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.341
- Like a basketball?
- It looked like it.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.776
It's on camera.
The whole thing is--

06:16.876 --> 06:18.578
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's terrible.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.346
- Tom, I don't think you're cut
out for the business world.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.081
- I know. I'm shutting it down.
I wanted to help my mom,

06:22.181 --> 06:23.616
but that's just
not gonna happen.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.385
- Tom, don't give up so easy.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.619
A lemonade stand

06:26.719 --> 06:28.888
is a time-honored
childhood tradition.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.456
- Not with me.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.791
You gotta shut it this time.
You gotta shut your mouth.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.593
- Tom, I know you're stressed

06:33.693 --> 06:36.963
and I know you're on the edge
ready to jump--don't do it.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.731
- Tom & Gramps
is all over social media.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.267
They're calling us
two generations of molesters.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.803
- Yes, I did see that
and it doesn't look good.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.272
But all you need to do
is pivot.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.274
The butt grab,
where'd that happen?

06:48.374 --> 06:49.876
Tom & Gramps.
- Yeah.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.445
- So change the name.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.814
Something vague like T&G's.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.482
- What do you mean?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.317
You could just change the name
and keep running the business?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.720
- Yeah, of course.
RadioShack is now "The Shack."

07:00.787 --> 07:03.589
Kentucky Fried Chicken
is now KFC.

07:03.656 --> 07:07.260
The mercenary group,
Blackwater is Academi.

07:07.326 --> 07:10.296
- This is great.
- Yeah. T&G's Lemonade.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.999
"The only thing we squeeze
are the lemons."

07:13.099 --> 07:14.634
- Oh, my God. I love it.
- Thank you.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.769
- Nelson, you wanna
join the company?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.838
- Sure. But you gotta make me
a board member.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.507
I'm not a front counter
apron-wearing type of guy.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.109
- All right.
You're on the board.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.944
Hey, Principal, you awake?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.446
- Yes.
What do you mean "am I awake?"

07:26.512 --> 07:28.014
- Some people sleep
with their eyes open.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.515
- We wanna buy some airtime

07:29.615 --> 07:31.117
during the morning
announcements, can we do that?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.852
- Yeah.
Like Buick and Grey Goose.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.921
- You know, to be honest
with you, it feels wrong,

07:34.987 --> 07:37.323
but I do really admire
your guys' hustle.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.325
So I'll give you 30 seconds.
That's it.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.760
- Thank you. Thank you.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.529
- Hey, gang,
it's your principal here.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.865
<i>The following
is a paid ad, okay?</i>

07:45.965 --> 07:47.767
<i>It's frowned upon.
It's illegal.</i>

07:47.834 --> 07:49.969
<i>And if you could just not say
anything to your parents,</i>

07:50.036 --> 07:52.104
<i>I'll do you something good
on the other side.</i>

07:52.171 --> 07:54.674
-
Thank you and greetings.

07:54.774 --> 07:58.144
As you may have heard,
my grandpa recently grabbed

07:58.211 --> 08:01.047
<i>and squeezed the rear end
of our school nurse.</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:05.351
- And this does not reflect
the core values of our brand.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.887
<i>- My grandpa has been
sidelined and I just want you</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:10.056
<i>to feel comfortable
when you come on in.</i>

08:10.156 --> 08:12.225
<i>No one's gonna make a lunge
for your butt.</i>

08:12.325 --> 08:13.860
<i>It's just going to be
a tasty lemonade</i>

08:13.960 --> 08:16.662
'cause that's the way
we do it at T&G's.

08:16.729 --> 08:20.733
- Where the only thing
we squeeze are the lemons.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.302
- Guys, seriously?
That was impressive.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.304
- Thank you. Well, we're
learning a lot about business.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.740
- Maybe I'll invest in you
like that show "Shark Tank."

08:27.840 --> 08:29.075
- Really?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.310
- Well, I was kidding,
but I mean, why not?

08:31.377 --> 08:33.145
I like to encourage things
like this.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.747
And I got a lot of extra money
from those

08:34.847 --> 08:37.984
morning announcements,
so here's 100 bucks.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.986
- You're just giving us $100?
- Yes.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.587
All I want is
my name on the door.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.389
"The Principal."
- I don't know about that.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.691
No, you know, if we had a door,
we--we'd accommodate this,

08:45.758 --> 08:47.093
but we don't,
there's no door.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.495
This is amazing.
I made my $100.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.230
I can quit now
and pay my Mom's bill.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.065
- Quit? We can't quit.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.234
We got to use this money
to scale up.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.903
- Scale up?
- Yeah.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.238
Let me introduce you to
a concept they call "flipping."

08:59.338 --> 09:00.706
- You're gonna flip
lemonade stands.

09:00.773 --> 09:01.941
- That's right.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.776
- Put our branding on it
and then sell it.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.545
- And then we gonna buy
two more.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.113
And then we're gonna
sell those two,

09:07.213 --> 09:08.614
and then we gonna buy four.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.416
- I actually like this plan.
- That's right.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.285
- All right.
Let's flip lemonade stands.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.121
- No slouching, Phil.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.290
At T&G's, we stand tall.
Bob, tuck your shirt in.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.758
Where you think you at,
McDonald's?

09:18.858 --> 09:21.294
- Yeah. Tuck it in, please.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.230
- It's so crazy how people
could be so stupid.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.198
- Yasmine, look alive.
- Hey, that's salt.

09:26.265 --> 09:29.235
That's not sugar, that's salt.
Don't put that in there.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.103
- Well, yeah, his grandpa
is still alive.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.639
It's just that he's been phased
out of the daily operations.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.908
You know, there was just
so much groping going on.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.877
Tushes and hands,
tushes and hands.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.612
It was like boop, boop, boop.
- Hector, Hector.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.747
Hey, we don't mention
the Grandpa incident.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.749
That was in the past, okay?
Whole new company.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.152
- Sorry, boss.
- Thank you. All right.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.220
Back to work.
Back to work, everyone.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.892
I can't believe we own a chain
of lemonade stands.

09:52.959 --> 09:53.993
We've doubled our investment.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.661
- Hey, stick with me.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.830
You'll be paying electric bills
for complete strangers.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.465
- Paying electric bills
for strangers?

09:59.565 --> 10:02.735
That doesn't really
even interest me, does it?

10:02.802 --> 10:04.971
- Tombo.
- There he is. There's Rick.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.506
- Other guy.
How's your lemonade stand?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.075
- Oh, we're not
selling lemonade.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.143
We're selling
lemonade "franchises."

10:11.243 --> 10:12.845
- It's great.
- Tom, I'm blown away,

10:12.945 --> 10:14.614
but can I offer a tiny bit
of constructive criticism?

10:14.680 --> 10:16.515
- Please don't criticize
my face again.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.752
- No one's doing brick
and mortar these days, okay?

10:19.819 --> 10:22.021
I would lose
the lemonade stands.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.123
- That's the whole thing.
That's the whole business.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.526
- The real money, guys,
is in "licensing" the brand.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.195
- No, I don't know.
I'm--I don't know about that.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.430
- Okay. My agency has
the Trader Joe's account,

10:31.497 --> 10:33.199
and they make these deals
all the time.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.800
I could set you up
with a pitch meeting.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.636
- Tom, we can make money
in our sleep.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.270
- I feel like I'm wealthy
enough, at this point.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.773
I made my sales goal.
Plus, I'm pretty busy.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.609
- Tom, from what I can tell,
you play whiffle ball

10:43.676 --> 10:46.112
and you chase squirrels.
You're not a busy person.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.847
- Oh, no, Rick, please.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.783
Things like that, that's why
my mom calls you "The Douche."

10:52.318 --> 10:53.986
I'm not sure about
this decision, Nelson.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.621
I had the $100

10:55.688 --> 10:57.723
and we spent it all
on power ties.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.959
- Come on, Tom. You need
to spend money to make money.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.028
When they see our power ties,
they're gonna be like,

11:02.128 --> 11:03.562
"Whoa, these guys
mean business."

11:03.663 --> 11:05.164
- Yeah.
But when they see my Mom--

11:05.231 --> 11:08.067
- Excuse me, do you guys
have a suggestion box here?

11:08.167 --> 11:11.070
Because I bought a party size
of bagel bites

11:11.170 --> 11:13.072
and it was not enough
for a party.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.474
- Yeah, your Mom kind of kills
the power vibe, man.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.343
We--we're gonna need
to work around her.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.579
Now, let's go close this deal.
Just let me do all the talking.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.684
- I have to admit, guys,
this is so fun.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.252
- Thank you.
- I mean, two friends

11:26.352 --> 11:28.220
inspired by their grandpas?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.923
I mean, this is
our brand DNA right here.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.925
- I came up with the name
and the slogan,

11:33.025 --> 11:35.494
"The only thing we squeeze
are the lemons."

11:35.561 --> 11:38.431
- I love it. I love it.
So what does he do?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.932
- Oh, Tom doesn't
talk in meetings.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.600
- You know, sometimes
I say dumb things.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.903
It kind of runs in the family.
-

11:44.003 --> 11:46.005
It's adorable. What a pair.
Okay. Wait.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.941
So I wanna start back
at the beginning.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.077
Why Trader Joe's?
- Why?

11:51.177 --> 11:53.512
Well, it's all about
corporate synergy. See--

11:53.579 --> 11:55.948
- We even use your lemonade
in this--in this whole thing.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.049
- Tom, don't do it.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.384
- I'm sorry. Come again.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.019
- We actually--
- Tom, stop.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.620
- Nelson, please, I got this.
Don't touch the mouth.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.522
We use Trader Joe's lemonade
to make our--

12:03.589 --> 12:04.890
we just pour it in
and then we--

12:04.957 --> 12:06.859
- Hold on.
So this is our product?

12:06.926 --> 12:08.527
- This is news to me.
- Yeah.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.296
Why are we not laughing
anymore? What's going on?

12:10.396 --> 12:13.566
- Why would we license our own
product back from ourselves?

12:13.632 --> 12:15.101
- Oh, no, no.
We water it down.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.869
- Tom.
- Oh, that's even better.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.871
So you are selling me back a
diluted version of my product.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.139
Is that it?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.640
- I mean, when you phrase it
like that,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.109
it sounds like
a bad business deal, but--

12:23.209 --> 12:25.144
- Okay.
Well, thanks for coming in.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.079
Feel free to show
yourselves out.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.049
- Okay.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.751
I think you were right.
I should not do the talking.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.220
No one in my family
should ever do the talking.
