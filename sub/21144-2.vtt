00:01.877 --> 00:03.221
Hey, guys, we've got
the whole gang here,

00:03.245 --> 00:05.120
and we're gonna play
Messy Musical Chairs.

00:05.156 --> 00:06.249
Frankie, tell 'em how it works.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.313
Well, it's musical chairs,

00:07.349 --> 00:08.857
except it's messy.

00:08.892 --> 00:09.895
- Very helpful.
- Thank you.

00:09.919 --> 00:11.452
Let's do it!

00:11.487 --> 00:12.944
- Round one: Cake.
- (bell rings)

00:12.979 --> 00:15.146
- Dirk: Here we go!
- (music playing)

00:15.182 --> 00:16.801
- Amelia: You can't touch it!
- Frankie: I'm not!

00:16.825 --> 00:19.859
- (record scratches, music stops)
- (screaming)

00:19.895 --> 00:22.796
Yes! I didn't lose!
I did not lose!

00:22.831 --> 00:24.840
- Frankie is out!
- (buzzer sounds)

00:24.875 --> 00:27.033
- Round two: Lasagna!
- (bell rings)

00:27.069 --> 00:28.621
- (music playing)
- Paige: Nobody cheat!

00:28.645 --> 00:31.313
- Dirk: Athleticism.
- Paige: Don't stop! Go, go, go!

00:31.348 --> 00:33.848
- (music stops)
- Dirk: Yes! Yes! Who's out?

00:33.884 --> 00:35.011
- Bernie: I'm in! I'm in!
- Dirk: Who's out?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.320
- (bell rings)
- Bernie: It's my chair!

00:36.344 --> 00:37.945
Dirk: It's open!

00:37.980 --> 00:39.371
It's open, yo!

00:39.407 --> 00:40.489
(shrieking)

00:43.435 --> 00:45.777
- Dirk: Who's out?
- I sat first!

00:45.813 --> 00:47.790
It was not me! It was... No!
No! -(Buzzer sounds)

00:47.814 --> 00:49.372
Frankie and Amelia are out.

00:49.407 --> 00:51.299
- Round three: Raw eggs!
- (bell rings)

00:51.334 --> 00:52.734
- Here we go!
- (music playing)

00:52.769 --> 00:54.611
Paige: Go. Don't go slow.

00:54.646 --> 00:56.074
Bernie: Hey, stop,
you can't push me.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.872
Frankie: Don't hover.
You can't hover.

00:57.908 --> 00:58.848
- (record scratches, music stops)
- (screaming)

00:58.883 --> 01:01.542
Dirk: Oh, yo! Yo!

01:01.578 --> 01:05.047
- Amelia: Bernie, out! Woo!
- (buzzer sounds)

01:05.082 --> 01:06.367
Frankie, Amelia,
and Bernie are out.

01:06.391 --> 01:08.424
- Now, it's time for some nachos.
- (bell rings)

01:08.460 --> 01:11.953
(music playing) - Frankie:
Okay, don't slip on it.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.139
(Frankie speaking indistinctly)

01:15.175 --> 01:17.025
- (record scratches, music stops)
- (screaming)

01:17.061 --> 01:19.636
- Dirk: Yeah! Yeah!
- (screaming)

01:19.671 --> 01:21.246
- (buzzer sounds)
- Bernie: Yes! Yes!

01:21.281 --> 01:24.457
Final round: Me versus
Horse Face Guy.

01:24.493 --> 01:26.154
- And we're sitting in some random blue goo.
- (bell rings)

01:26.178 --> 01:28.319
You're goin' down!

01:28.355 --> 01:31.423
(music playing) - Horse Face Guy!
Horse Face Fuy!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.459
Hey, I thought we were friends!

01:33.494 --> 01:35.151
Horse Face Guy!

01:35.186 --> 01:37.028
- (music stops)
- Dirk: No! No!

01:37.064 --> 01:38.522
(neighs)

01:38.557 --> 01:41.733
(bell rings)

01:41.768 --> 01:45.587
(cheering) - Dirk: Come on!

That was a great shoot!

02:40.936 --> 02:42.394
"Chocolate Bananas" is gonna be

02:42.429 --> 02:43.879
the funniest video
we've ever made.

02:43.914 --> 02:44.914
Hey, cheers to that.

02:46.883 --> 02:48.892
Now, time for
the most exciting part

02:48.927 --> 02:51.144
of the video-making process:

02:51.179 --> 02:55.624
Meticulously editing
for three to six hours!

02:55.659 --> 02:58.727
<i>♪ We're long and we're yummy
We hang out in your tummy ♪</i>

02:58.762 --> 03:01.988
<i>♪ And if you leave us

03:02.023 --> 03:03.381
Paige: Something's not right.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.118
Yeah.

03:07.663 --> 03:08.470
Paige:
Is it the dance we're doing?

03:08.505 --> 03:09.679
No.

03:12.576 --> 03:14.108
Is it the melody?

03:14.144 --> 03:17.420
No.

03:17.456 --> 03:19.701
Paige: Is it the fact that we look
like two giant dancing pieces of poop?

03:19.725 --> 03:20.857
Yep, that's it.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.987
How did this happen?

03:26.023 --> 03:28.415
The costumes
don't look like poop.

03:28.492 --> 03:30.617
But I'm looking at the screen,
and I'm seein' poop!

03:32.762 --> 03:34.554
Maybe it's not as bad
as we think.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.631
I'm sure the video gets better.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.492
<i>♪ We're brown and we're nutty ♪</i>

03:38.527 --> 03:40.218
<i>♪ Boop, boop, boop ♪</i>

03:40.253 --> 03:41.962
Just keep playin' it.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.591
<i>♪ We smell kinda funny
Boop, boop... ♪</i>

03:46.626 --> 03:50.462
That's not even true! Chocolate
bananas smell like chocolate!

03:50.497 --> 03:53.248
That only applies to poop!

03:53.283 --> 03:55.058
Also, are we saying
"boop" or "poop"?

03:55.094 --> 03:57.193
We're obviously saying "boop."

03:57.228 --> 04:00.722
Well, it doesn't sound like it!

04:00.757 --> 04:03.332
Oh no, and there's that part about
flushing us down the toilet.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.001
That can apply
to chocolate bananas.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.414
You can flush anything
down the toilet.

04:06.438 --> 04:09.181
But why would we say it?

04:09.216 --> 04:11.224
Did we even say the words
"chocolate bananas"?

04:11.260 --> 04:13.485
Oh, no.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.721
I don't even know what we thought
this video was gonna be about.

04:16.756 --> 04:21.735
You're right. We're never gonna
post it, nobody will ever see it.

04:21.770 --> 04:23.573
You know what the worst part
about this song is?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.297
- What?
- It's catchy!

04:30.945 --> 04:32.879
Hey, Claire.
How was your weekend?

04:32.915 --> 04:35.257
Not good. I went to my
grandfather's funeral.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.641
That's awesome. I bought a boat!

04:39.454 --> 04:41.563
Aw, man, another funeral
I didn't get invited to?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.993
I don't get it, Bernie. I've really
been workin' on my social skills

04:47.028 --> 04:50.112
so I can make friends.

04:50.148 --> 04:52.927
At Vuuugle, I don't have to try because
I can just talk about myself for hours

04:52.951 --> 04:54.433
and everyone loves it!

04:54.469 --> 04:55.469
Uh-huh.

04:58.315 --> 05:00.666
But at school,
people talk about boring things,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.884
that aren't me.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.821
So, I made flash cards with
tips on how to talk to people.

05:06.857 --> 05:09.966
You should've just come to me for help.
I'm great at conversation.

05:10.002 --> 05:12.218
Hey, what's up, Russell?

05:14.881 --> 05:16.431
I did my part.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.138
You're so lucky,
you already have a best friend.

05:20.162 --> 05:23.388
Right. Wait, who?

05:23.423 --> 05:26.007
Dirk.

05:26.042 --> 05:28.543
Really?
You think we're best friends?

05:28.579 --> 05:31.679
I don't care,
I was just sayin' words.

05:31.715 --> 05:34.165
I mean... Hold on...

05:34.200 --> 05:36.701
Weather, Sports, Nice Pants...

05:38.288 --> 05:41.797
No.

05:41.833 --> 05:45.418
You know, Dirk's never actually
called me his best friend.

05:45.453 --> 05:47.164
I mean, I've always thought
of him as my best friend,

05:47.188 --> 05:48.671
but I don't know
if he thinks I'm his.

05:49.991 --> 05:52.041
Uhh...

05:52.077 --> 05:56.304
You know, I've never
had a best friend before.

05:56.339 --> 05:59.107
I mean, if I told Dirk he was
mine and he didn't say it back,

05:59.142 --> 06:00.667
I don't think I could handle it.

06:00.702 --> 06:02.861
Bernie, just tell Dirk
he's your best friend,

06:02.896 --> 06:07.373
and I'm sure he'll tell you
you're his best friend.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.535
You're right. Thanks, Amelia,
that's really good advice.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.546
Yeah, it is.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.652
I can't wait to get back to Vuuugle and tell
everyone how good I am at conversations.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.027
I'll bet they're all dyin'
to hear about it.

06:19.062 --> 06:20.062
Uh-huh.

06:24.660 --> 06:28.310
School is dumb? School is dumb?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.830
School is dumb! School is...

06:30.865 --> 06:32.132
Oh...

06:34.128 --> 06:36.394
I thought you guys
were my peeps.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.438
I let you call me Karen.

06:38.473 --> 06:40.782
Not principal.
Not even Principal Karen.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.992
Just Karen!

06:43.027 --> 06:45.628
So this...

06:45.664 --> 06:49.157
this is a betrayal!

06:49.192 --> 06:52.055
Do you think she cares a little too much
about being friends with her students?

06:52.079 --> 06:55.204
All right, who's
the graffiti vandal?

06:55.239 --> 06:57.607
Was it you, Brittany?

06:57.642 --> 06:59.284
We got our ears
pierced together!

07:01.630 --> 07:04.822
This heinous crime happened
sometime last night.

07:04.857 --> 07:11.296
If anyone has any information about the...
coward who did this,

07:11.331 --> 07:15.300
I will be in my office, posting
my feelings on social media.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.720
At "Cool Principal 18." Please
follow me, I post cool stuff.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.086
We filmed "Chocolate Bananas"
right here last night.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.470
You don't think we caught whoever
did this on video, do you?

07:27.506 --> 07:31.758
Aaaah, it's so much worse
the second time!

07:31.793 --> 07:35.528
Who's idea was it to squat so
much while we were singing?

07:39.743 --> 07:42.160
Paige, look!
It's the graffiti vandal.

07:44.389 --> 07:46.656
We have proof, we have
to show this to someone.

07:46.691 --> 07:49.709
Hold on. That would mean showing
someone "Chocolate Bananas."

07:51.888 --> 07:53.679
Both: <i>♪ Beatbox solo! ♪</i>

07:53.715 --> 07:57.842
(sputtering)

08:02.415 --> 08:04.557
- No, just turn it off.
- Turn it off.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.199
I'm telling you,
this is a bad idea.

08:13.235 --> 08:14.503
We shouldn't show Principal
Karen "Chocolate Bananas."

08:14.527 --> 08:16.385
That woman can't keep a secret.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.171
She even has a gossip board!

08:18.206 --> 08:20.856
"Rebecca loves Tony."

08:20.892 --> 08:23.618
Heh. With those eyes, get in
line, am I right? (Laughs)

08:26.097 --> 08:28.957
Relax. We're not just gonna
hand over the video.

08:28.992 --> 08:31.559
We'll feel out the vibe. If it
seems like we can't trust her,

08:31.595 --> 08:34.737
we won't give it to her.
Karen loves us.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.347
(knocking on door)

08:36.383 --> 08:37.974
Hey, Karen.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.009
It's "Principal" now.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.330
Ew, that sounds so weird.

08:44.365 --> 08:46.223
I can't stay mad at you guys.
We're a trio!

08:46.259 --> 08:47.933
Paige, Karen and Frankie!

08:47.969 --> 08:51.587
PKF! Puh-Keff! Right?

08:51.622 --> 08:53.523
- Paige/Frankie: Yeah.
- Say it!

08:55.334 --> 08:58.094
Paige/Frankie: P... Puh-Keff!

08:58.129 --> 09:01.289
Sorry, I freaked. This locker
vandal sitch is really...

09:01.324 --> 09:03.049
stressin' my dressin'.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.692
Ooh, I just made that up,
I like it.

09:04.728 --> 09:07.178
Do you like it?
Do you think it'll catch on?

09:07.213 --> 09:10.097
Uh, sure.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.092
A... Actually, we wanna
help you find the vandal

09:13.127 --> 09:16.796
because it's also, uh, really, stressin'
our dressin'. (Softly) I hate myself.

09:18.458 --> 09:22.260
So, um, hypothetically, if someone
saw the vandal in action,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.045
could that person
just describe it to you?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.255
(sighs) Sadly, no.
Without evidence,

09:26.291 --> 09:28.011
it's just one person's word
against another's.

09:28.035 --> 09:33.521
Um... uh, okay, uh, what if, hypothetically,
the crime was caught on video,

09:33.557 --> 09:35.548
and that video
made its way to you?

09:35.583 --> 09:37.124
You'd keep that
to yourself, right?

09:37.160 --> 09:41.371
(laughs) No way! I'd put
that sucker online.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.990
My followers need to know
what I'm up to.

09:44.025 --> 09:46.545
In fact, I should be live streaming
this conversation right now.

09:48.179 --> 09:51.163
- Uh, okay, good luck finding him!
- Or her!

09:51.199 --> 09:52.582
Crime is gender neutral!

09:56.079 --> 09:59.939
What's up, Dareheads? In today's video, I'm
joined by my partner in crime, Bernie!

09:59.975 --> 10:01.674
And today,
we're playin' a game called...

10:05.664 --> 10:08.597
Dirk bought a bunch of things
from the grocery store,

10:08.633 --> 10:11.045
and we're gonna put them on our feet and
try to do various activities in them

10:11.069 --> 10:13.411
to see if they work as shoes.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.031
And if they do,
we'll flash these can be shoes!

10:16.107 --> 10:19.550
But if they don't, we'll flash
these can't be shoes!

10:19.585 --> 10:21.025
Both:
And we're not gonna need these!

10:22.738 --> 10:23.738
Both: Baby potties!

10:27.010 --> 10:29.276
- Dirk: Oh!
- Ow!

10:29.312 --> 10:31.579
I was jumping, and it was,
like, landing on my foot.

10:31.614 --> 10:33.174
Yeah, I don't know
if I like these ones.

10:34.351 --> 10:35.351
Both: Watermelons!

10:37.954 --> 10:38.954
Oh!

10:42.551 --> 10:45.231
- What kind of watermelon...
- The juice, it feels weird on my toes!

10:46.512 --> 10:48.146
Both: Priceless works of art!

10:48.181 --> 10:49.931
These are my grandma's.

10:49.966 --> 10:50.966
Uhh!

10:52.160 --> 10:53.968
Oh, yeah!

10:54.003 --> 10:54.894
I really like the feel to these.

10:54.929 --> 10:56.504
Stylish, too!

10:56.539 --> 10:57.313
What is that,
is that a Van Gogh?

10:57.348 --> 10:58.348
(Dirk laughs)

10:59.667 --> 11:00.667
Bernie: Sub sandwiches!

11:04.581 --> 11:06.739
- Mine already...
- Rippin'!

11:06.775 --> 11:08.257
Bernie:
How are you going so fast?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.386
Call 'em skate shoes!
No, they're not!

11:09.410 --> 11:10.701
No, they're not! Oww!

11:10.737 --> 11:11.744
- Can't...
- Be shoes!

11:14.415 --> 11:17.641
Ohhh! It feels so good!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.410
Mac and cheese! Comfortable!

11:19.445 --> 11:21.003
Whoa!

11:24.675 --> 11:26.050
These can't be shoes!

11:30.840 --> 11:34.384
This is good.
You can barely taste the foot.

11:34.419 --> 11:35.826
Thanks for doing that, Bern-Man.

11:35.862 --> 11:40.782
Always great making a vid
with my bud.

11:40.817 --> 11:47.397
Uh, speaking of... uh, words, there's, uh,
there's something I've been meaning to tell you.

11:47.432 --> 11:50.908
Dirk, we've been hanging out for a while
now, and I just... I just want you to know

11:50.944 --> 11:56.764
that you're my bah... my beh...

11:56.800 --> 11:58.552
beh, ah-bah dah, dah
ah-dah ba-dah ah-dah bah...

11:58.576 --> 12:01.077
You can stop.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.297
I know
what you're tryin' to say.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.764
- You do?
- Yeah.

12:04.799 --> 12:07.992
You wanna start a jazz band!

12:08.028 --> 12:12.872
(jazz music playing) -♪ Bop bop
bop bop bop bop diddley doh ♪

12:12.907 --> 12:17.527
♪ Scot scot scot scot
scot scot diddley do ♪

12:17.562 --> 12:20.313
Nose kazoo solo! Take it, Cady!

12:20.348 --> 12:24.066
(playing kazoo)

12:28.240 --> 12:29.906
Big finish!

12:37.624 --> 12:42.977
Whoo! Great practice, guys!
The gig's on Thursday!

12:43.013 --> 12:45.454
And Cady...
you can keep that kazoo.

12:45.489 --> 12:46.881
Sweet!

12:48.234 --> 12:50.501
Uh, Dirk.

12:50.536 --> 12:55.014
Uh, that was fun and all, but what I
was really tryin' to say before is...

12:57.810 --> 13:00.085
you're my best friend.

13:00.121 --> 13:02.313
Aw... thanks, man.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.068
Thanks?

13:11.407 --> 13:13.532
It wasn't me, I swear!

13:13.568 --> 13:14.725
Paige: What's going on?

13:14.760 --> 13:17.286
There was more graffiti
last night.

13:17.322 --> 13:21.549
And our security guard, Clark, saw Amelia
leaving school around the same time.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.760
I wasn't here, of course,
because I was at home,

13:23.762 --> 13:25.172
listening to Ariana Grande.
Do you guys like her?

13:25.196 --> 13:26.516
I like her,
but I'm wiling not to.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.692
I told you, I'm innocent!

13:31.728 --> 13:34.537
And what about
Security Guard Clark?

13:34.572 --> 13:36.222
What was he doin' here
last night?

13:36.257 --> 13:38.866
What were any of us
doing here last night?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.185
- We're all just a bunch of molecules...
- Okay, Clark.

13:43.898 --> 13:47.132
Amelia, I wanna believe
you're innocent,

13:47.168 --> 13:49.313
but I need you to tell me what
you were doing here last night.

13:49.337 --> 13:51.554
I can't!

13:51.589 --> 13:53.800
Shouldn't we help Amelia?
We know she didn't do anything.

13:53.824 --> 13:55.574
I'm sure it'll be fine.

13:55.609 --> 13:57.927
Okay, let's just see
how this plays out.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.872
Then I have no choice but to give you
two weeks of in-school suspension.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.774
Ahh?

14:02.809 --> 14:04.609
Let's... Let's keep seeing
how this plays out.

14:07.305 --> 14:11.223
Amelia, you obviously
didn't do it.

14:11.258 --> 14:12.911
Why didn't you just tell Principal Karen
what you were doing here last night?

14:12.935 --> 14:15.186
I couldn't.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.114
It's too embarrassing.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.683
Okay, Amelia. They'll all
be here for real tomorrow.

14:20.718 --> 14:24.687
Let's just practice
normal conversations.

14:24.722 --> 14:28.424
Hello, Janine. That sure is a
nice sweater and/or blouse.

14:28.459 --> 14:31.369
I have one just like...
No, Amelia!

14:31.404 --> 14:33.329
The world does not
revolve around you!

14:33.364 --> 14:35.464
This is Janine's conversation,
not yours.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.491
(taking a deep breath)
From the top!

14:39.820 --> 14:42.638
I don't wanna sit in a room
by myself for two weeks.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.640
Things were getting better
for me here.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.626
I even got someone
to eat lunch with me tomorrow.

14:49.197 --> 14:51.756
Guess I'll be
eating alone again. (Sighs)

14:53.510 --> 14:55.810
(sighs) Aww.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.278
Well, we saw
how that played out.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.463
So, movies?

14:59.498 --> 15:02.933
- Frankie!
- Ah-ha, I know, you're gonna make me talk about this

15:02.969 --> 15:04.018
for the next four hours.

15:07.898 --> 15:11.333
(video game bleeping)

15:11.368 --> 15:12.763
Bernie (thinking): <i>Okay, B-Money.
You told Dirk</i>

15:12.787 --> 15:14.723
<i>he was your best friend,
and he didn't say it back.</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:18.449
<i>Obviously, he isn't the kind of guy
to throw around the word "best."</i>

15:18.484 --> 15:20.826
Yo, Bern-Man!

15:20.861 --> 15:22.912
You want some jelly beans?
They're the best!

15:25.975 --> 15:28.526
The best? Really?
What makes them the best?

15:28.561 --> 15:31.812
Well, on the outside,
they have a hard exterior,

15:31.848 --> 15:34.331
but on the inside,
they're soft and warm.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.526
Bernie (thinking): <i>That's how
I would describe myself!</i>

15:38.120 --> 15:41.047
Also, they're really sweet.

15:41.082 --> 15:43.098
Bernie (thinking): <i>I'm sweet!</i>

15:43.134 --> 15:45.709
And, they come in a box.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.045
I've been in box.

15:48.081 --> 15:52.733
So, is there anything else in the
room you'd describe as the best?

15:55.880 --> 15:57.405
Nope. That's it.

16:00.075 --> 16:01.951
Sweet! Pizza's here.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.707
This guy is the best!

16:12.772 --> 16:16.182
We have to hand over "Chocolate
Bananas" to save Amelia.

16:16.259 --> 16:19.160
We can't. We'll be the
laughing stock of school.

16:19.195 --> 16:22.580
Come on, Frankie. You know
it's the right thing to do.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.799
Fine. But we're not
showing that video.

16:24.834 --> 16:28.311
I have an idea.

16:28.346 --> 16:31.339
(suspenseful music playing) - There's
a fire drill scheduled tomorrow.

16:31.374 --> 16:34.100
While everyone's outside,
including Amelia,

16:34.135 --> 16:36.819
we'll spray-paint some lockers.

16:36.854 --> 16:38.979
That'll prove
that Amelia didn't do it,

16:39.015 --> 16:41.095
and Principal Karen will
have to lift her suspension.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.861
(music stops) - Wow! You just
came up with that whole plan

16:45.897 --> 16:47.888
- on the spot?
- No, I've had it for a while.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.765
I was saving it
for something important,

16:49.801 --> 16:51.333
but I guess
we can waste it on Amelia.

16:52.754 --> 16:53.978
Okay, I'm in.

16:54.013 --> 16:58.424
Just like that? You're not
gonna list the pros and cons,

16:58.459 --> 17:00.429
and say we shouldn't do it
'cause we could get suspended?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.903
Hey, I don't always worry.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.556
I can be cool. But seriously,
think we could get suspended?

17:07.251 --> 17:08.309
There's my girl.

17:11.806 --> 17:14.315
<i>Hey, guys, Amelia here.</i>

17:14.350 --> 17:17.034
<i>Wrongly servin' time
at in-school suspension.</i>

17:17.070 --> 17:19.845
So here's some DIY ways for
you to break me out of here...

17:19.881 --> 17:21.705
Man: Be quiet!

17:21.741 --> 17:26.593
Hey, guys, me again. Grab a
shovel, a ladder, some perfume...

17:26.629 --> 17:27.669
Man: I can still hear you!

17:30.099 --> 17:33.141
- Oo-yah an-kay...
- Man: Pig Latin is still talking!

17:33.177 --> 17:34.543
One more week's suspension!

17:38.725 --> 17:41.583
- (softly) Subscribe below!
- Man: Two more weeks!

can't go through with this,

18:34.330 --> 18:38.198
even the fantasy
made me uncomfortable.

18:38.233 --> 18:39.594
Can we at least do the part where I run
out of paint and you throw me a can?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.176
Ooh, yeah.

18:41.212 --> 18:42.486
Ahhhh...

18:45.725 --> 18:48.475
You two
are the graffiti vandals?

Both: Uhhhhhhh...

18:50.604 --> 18:52.163
My office, now.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.861
I hate that you're making me raise my voice
in front of Jason and the cool kids!

Bern-Man?
Who is that super cool guy?

19:14.311 --> 19:17.021
Who? Oh-ho, you
mean my boy, Bondo?

19:21.210 --> 19:22.462
I'm surprised you guys
haven't met.

19:22.486 --> 19:24.186
We pretty much
do everything together.

19:24.221 --> 19:27.289
- Right, Bondo?
- True that, Barney.

19:27.324 --> 19:29.683
Did he call you Barney?

19:29.719 --> 19:32.811
Ahh... No, Bondo just has a weird
accent that makes his "errs"

19:32.847 --> 19:36.315
sound like "arrs."

19:36.350 --> 19:38.237
Or something. It's one of my
favorite things about him.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.030
Bondo! Tell Dirk your
favorite thing about me.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.562
I don't know, I just met you.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.582
Ha-ha! Bond-O!
This guy is always on!

19:45.618 --> 19:49.161
Hey, wanna see Bondo jump the
couch on his motorcycle?

19:49.196 --> 19:50.646
I don't know how to do that.

19:50.681 --> 19:53.615
Ha-ha, classic Bondo!

19:53.651 --> 19:56.510
Anyway, just wanted
to let you know me and Bonz

19:56.546 --> 19:58.921
are headed off on a
cross-country motorcycle trip,

19:58.956 --> 20:00.117
so, I won't be around
for a while.

20:00.141 --> 20:01.640
Cross-country?

20:01.675 --> 20:03.225
Really?

20:03.260 --> 20:05.385
Why? Does that make you jealous?

20:05.421 --> 20:08.573
'Cause me and Bonderosa here are
pretty tight, like, the highest level

20:08.608 --> 20:12.209
of really good friends, like, if there
were a word for better than good,

20:12.244 --> 20:14.411
like, top, good, friend.

20:16.507 --> 20:20.942
Yeah, man. If only.

20:20.978 --> 20:23.540
Well, let me know if you need me to take
care of anything while you're gone.

20:23.564 --> 20:25.050
Actually, if you could
water some of my plants.

20:25.074 --> 20:28.542
Seriously, Bondo?

20:28.578 --> 20:30.513
Okay, Dirk. I think it's
pretty clear how you feel.

20:30.537 --> 20:31.537
See you around.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.393
Hey, man. Take care of that little guy.
He's my best friend.

20:39.789 --> 20:40.896
- Aah!
- (thuds)

20:43.567 --> 20:45.935
I'm your best friend?

20:45.970 --> 20:48.996
Of course, Bern.
I love you, bro.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.447
Thanks, man.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.201
Thanks?

20:58.248 --> 21:00.849
We're not the vandals!

21:00.884 --> 21:04.303
I wish I could believe you, but
not only did you deface lockers,

21:04.338 --> 21:06.880
you defaced my trust.

21:06.915 --> 21:09.583
And for lying to me,
I have to expel you.

21:09.618 --> 21:10.618
Sorry not sorry.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.398
Expel us? Um, can Paige and I
chat in private for a moment

21:16.434 --> 21:17.434
to discuss?

21:21.255 --> 21:25.007
(tinny pop music playing)

21:25.042 --> 21:26.425
I say we take the expulsion.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.084
What? Enough is enough.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.770
We have to show her the video.

21:29.805 --> 21:32.565
- Or...
- (suspenseful music playing)

21:32.600 --> 21:33.916
- Here's the plan...
- No!

21:33.951 --> 21:36.893
- (music stops)
- No more plans.

21:36.929 --> 21:37.929
(sighs) Fine.

21:40.816 --> 21:43.158
We have proof that it wasn't us.

21:43.194 --> 21:46.453
We caught the real locker vandal
on video by accident.

21:46.489 --> 21:48.939
All we ask is that you
keep this to yourself.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.467
Of course I will!
We're Puh-Keff! Right?

21:52.869 --> 21:54.453
Say it!

21:54.489 --> 21:55.846
Both: Puh-Keff!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.426
I found the real locker vandal.

22:01.462 --> 22:03.687
Simon Vandalman?
How did I not see that coming?

22:05.725 --> 22:09.601
Yep, he was just about to spray another
locker and I caught him in the act.

22:09.637 --> 22:11.348
Or did he catch me
in the act of pondering my...

22:11.372 --> 22:12.821
Okay, Clark!

22:14.491 --> 22:17.509
Also, Simon, school isn't dumb.

22:17.545 --> 22:21.588
Your attitude is. Ohh, slam!

22:21.624 --> 22:25.717
Not from you.

22:25.753 --> 22:29.121
How redonks was that? He walked in
right after you gave me this video

22:29.156 --> 22:32.867
- of the crime in progress.

22:47.175 --> 22:49.925
