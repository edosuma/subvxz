is you don't hire people

19:26.332 --> 19:27.731
to do the stuff
you like to do,

19:27.766 --> 19:30.334
you hire people to do the stuff
you<i> don't</i> like to do.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.835
Well,
I would love that.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.004
That would be great,
but it's<i> my</i> company,

19:34.039 --> 19:36.507
it's my responsibility,
and I feel like I'm the one

19:36.542 --> 19:38.142
who should be doing
all that stuff.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.810
Right, well, I think you have
that half right.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.479
It is your responsibility
to get stuff done,

19:42.514 --> 19:44.181
but, honey,
if you're not happy,

19:44.216 --> 19:47.685
your business is not going
to be a success.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.354
You're right.
You're right.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.388
You know what?

19:51.423 --> 19:54.091
Screw you, Quicken.
- [ Chuckles ]

19:54.126 --> 19:56.760
You ha-- Hire an administrator
to do the paperwork,

19:56.795 --> 19:59.196
then you go out and shoot stuff
smaller than you.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.864
You deserve it.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.266
[ Chuckles ] All right, thanks.
Thanks, sweetie.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.367
You bet.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.838
Oh, hey, you know who would be
a great administrator?

20:07.873 --> 20:08.906
Ryan.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.744
A lefty in
a bloated bureaucracy.

20:16.815 --> 20:17.582
Perfect.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.558
Hey, Eve!

20:30.095 --> 20:31.428
Hey.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.597
Thanks.
We'd love to join.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.933
Kyle, come get a seat.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.301
Oh, I don't need to.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.636
I'm already wearing one.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.906
Well, this could be
promising.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.643
You bet your sweet Sants
it is.

20:54.486 --> 20:57.087
Uh, ta-freaking-da.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.622
Yay!

20:58.657 --> 21:00.591
Baby,
QVC, here we come!

21:00.626 --> 21:02.526
We're gonna
be chair rich.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.097
So, Eve, what do you think?
Are you, uh, wowed? - Yeah.

21:07.132 --> 21:08.599
Well, I got to hand
it to you,

21:08.634 --> 21:10.000
it does look pretty
uncomfortable,

21:10.035 --> 21:11.969
but it appears
to work.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.437
Well, no, it's actually
super comfortable.

21:13.472 --> 21:14.805
Yeah.
- 'Cause the belt is so tight

21:14.840 --> 21:18.475
that you're completely numb
from the waist down.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.444
It's invented
by the guy

21:20.479 --> 21:22.546
completely numb
from the neck up.
