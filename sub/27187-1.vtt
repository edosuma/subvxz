00:40.143 --> 00:41.455
Okay, Clara,
you don't have to kill us.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.460
It just makes no sense.

00:46.494 --> 00:47.495
Well...

00:51.775 --> 00:53.122
Wait.

00:53.156 --> 00:54.537
I think I see it.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.263
Is that it? Is that it?

00:57.298 --> 00:59.749
Oh, what a relief.

00:59.783 --> 01:02.165
I thought I was gonna have to
try to find it online.

01:26.362 --> 01:29.089
Excuse me. Hello?

01:29.951 --> 01:31.160
Do you mind?

01:35.233 --> 01:36.406
Lady.

01:36.441 --> 01:37.545
Can you see me?

01:40.203 --> 01:41.204
Hello?

01:42.205 --> 01:43.551
Come on!

01:43.586 --> 01:44.794
Come on!

01:44.828 --> 01:45.829
Come on!

01:50.317 --> 01:51.490
Sorry.

02:03.192 --> 02:04.400
Damn it.

02:07.886 --> 02:09.473
It's not it, Ted.

02:15.687 --> 02:17.482
It's exactly like this one.

02:17.516 --> 02:18.931
The brand is Dina,

02:18.966 --> 02:21.727
or Dina, D-I-N-A.

02:21.762 --> 02:24.558
And I got them at Marshall's

02:24.592 --> 02:26.629
near the Palisades mall,

02:26.663 --> 02:28.872
with my sister in New Jersey.

02:28.907 --> 02:31.979
And I think I had
a store credit.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.361
And, oh, they were on clearance.

02:34.395 --> 02:36.466
So, there's no way they
have them there anymore.

02:36.501 --> 02:37.812
Gotcha. So,

02:37.847 --> 02:39.262
someone stole your shoe?

02:39.676 --> 02:40.953
No, no, um,

02:40.988 --> 02:43.956
we took and it fell out
of the car somewhere.

02:43.991 --> 02:45.786
You could fill out
a stolen property...

02:45.820 --> 02:48.513
No, no, we've been searching
for it for hours,

02:48.547 --> 02:49.824
it got dark.

02:49.859 --> 02:51.309
It's a size nine.

02:52.586 --> 02:54.208
Wearing two shoes now.

02:54.243 --> 02:55.347
No, no.Right?

02:55.382 --> 02:56.969
These are from DSW.

02:57.763 --> 02:58.902
I like DSW.

02:58.937 --> 03:01.250
The missing shoe
is from Marshall's.

03:01.284 --> 03:04.425
So you just have a back-up pair in your
car in case someone lost your shoe?

03:04.460 --> 03:06.496
No, I wasn't wearing them.

03:06.531 --> 03:09.534
They were in my car
but they weren't on my feet.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.330
Were in your car
but they weren't on your feet.

03:12.364 --> 03:14.677
The left shoe
was the missing shoe.

03:16.748 --> 03:17.749
Oh.

03:20.407 --> 03:24.273
We have a "Lost Item Report"
that you can fill out.

03:24.307 --> 03:26.447
That way,
if anyone returns it...

03:26.482 --> 03:28.553
Are you kidding me?

03:28.587 --> 03:32.695
Is there someone above you I can speak with to help me figure this out?

03:33.351 --> 03:35.456
I'm sorry, um,

03:35.491 --> 03:36.768
I'm the only one here.

03:36.802 --> 03:38.735
Do you see my husband out there?

03:38.770 --> 03:42.360
Do you recognize him?
Ted Reynolds?

03:42.394 --> 03:45.915
Does he eat at Andy's Deli
on Elm on Saturdays often?

03:45.949 --> 03:48.676
Ted Reynolds, the actor.

03:48.711 --> 03:52.646
I'm gonna have to go out there and tell him that you didn't help me at all.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.510
And he's gonna be very upset.

03:55.752 --> 03:56.753
Ted Reynolds?

04:04.382 --> 04:05.969
Well, I think
it's time for a drink.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.524
Damn right.

05:55.009 --> 05:57.115
Oh, my gosh!

05:57.149 --> 05:58.496
Look at that moon.

05:59.428 --> 06:01.809
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

06:01.844 --> 06:03.984
I don't think I've ever seen,

06:04.018 --> 06:05.813
seen a moon like that.

06:06.883 --> 06:10.818
Spectacularly beautiful.

06:10.853 --> 06:12.958
Is it supposed to be
a full moon tonight?

06:12.993 --> 06:16.997
Oh, honey,
I don't know if the moon is supposed to be full.

06:17.031 --> 06:19.586
Okay, I'm gonna take him out.I am not the boss of the moon.

06:19.620 --> 06:20.828
Take who out? Oliver.

06:20.863 --> 06:23.072
No, no, you're gonna stay.

06:23.106 --> 06:24.418
Come down here.

06:24.453 --> 06:26.800
I need to take Oliver... Come down with me.

06:26.834 --> 06:29.768
Lie down
on the rug with me.

06:29.803 --> 06:33.462
We can look at the ceiling and pretend we're looking at stars.

06:34.014 --> 06:36.637
Come here. Come here.

06:36.672 --> 06:39.053
Give me some sugar.

06:39.088 --> 06:40.883
Oh, God.Come on.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.850
Oh, I need to take the dog out.

06:42.885 --> 06:45.439
No, you are not taking him out.

06:45.474 --> 06:46.509
It's not fair to him.

06:46.544 --> 06:48.856
Ow! Ow!

06:48.891 --> 06:51.859
I'm tender. My bones
are like chicken bones.

06:51.894 --> 06:52.998
They're very brittle.Jesus.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.760
Go do your duty.

08:07.210 --> 08:08.211
That's a good song.

08:09.178 --> 08:12.077
1969, Ollie.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.080
I was 14.

08:17.842 --> 08:19.326

Where'd you go?

10:09.781 --> 10:10.782
Okay.

10:16.892 --> 10:18.652
Somebody's gotta do it.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.655
So, it has to be me.

10:27.730 --> 10:28.731
Get in there.

10:35.842 --> 10:37.395
Shit.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.155
Oh, hi.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.850
Hello, this is Clara,

10:43.884 --> 10:46.369
and I should be cleaning.

10:46.404 --> 10:49.441
I cleaned by kitchen
and it looks good.

10:49.476 --> 10:54.792
But my office is still...
It needs work.

10:54.826 --> 10:58.934
It's late here,
but I figured with the time difference on the West Coast,

10:58.968 --> 11:00.107
it'd be okay.

11:00.798 --> 11:02.800
Um, I'm-I'm-I'm...

11:03.766 --> 11:05.699
I like your wine.

11:05.734 --> 11:09.151
I think that you'd probably
guessed that by now.

11:09.185 --> 11:10.739
Maybe you didn't,
I don't know.

11:11.809 --> 11:14.984
Anyway, um,

11:15.019 --> 11:18.263
I'm looking at your website,
at the whole bunch of you,

11:18.298 --> 11:21.335
and it just seems like
such a wonderful family,

11:21.370 --> 11:24.166
and such a great team.

11:29.205 --> 11:30.379
Oh.

11:30.413 --> 11:35.280
I found and obituary for
Mary Gardener's father online,

11:35.315 --> 11:38.939
and it said that
he passed away from cancer.

11:38.974 --> 11:41.873
And I was just wondering
what kind, because,

11:42.909 --> 11:45.946
it is just such horrible stuff.

11:50.951 --> 11:54.852
I like the fruity undertones
of the wine.

11:54.886 --> 11:59.857
And I was just wondering,
is that something that you plan for

11:59.891 --> 12:02.445
or is it just a coincidence.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.481
The fruity.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.828
Anyway,

12:05.863 --> 12:09.521
if someone could call me back about the fruity undertones,

12:09.556 --> 12:11.938
I would really appreciate that.

12:11.972 --> 12:13.111
Thank you.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.221
Clara.

12:57.431 --> 12:58.432
Oh, my God.

13:00.641 --> 13:01.850
Sweetheart.

13:01.884 --> 13:03.334
Oh, you cutie.

13:03.368 --> 13:05.439
Magazine people
are coming at 1:00.

13:05.474 --> 13:07.579
And the girls will be here
in about an hour.

13:07.614 --> 13:08.960
Oh.

13:11.652 --> 13:12.895
Ollie.

13:12.930 --> 13:15.864
Oh, it's your birthday,
little boy.

13:15.898 --> 13:17.003
Come here.

13:17.037 --> 13:19.868
Oh, honey, happy birthday.

13:19.902 --> 13:21.904
You got a big day today.

13:21.939 --> 13:24.010
Oh, come here. Hi.

13:24.562 --> 13:26.012
Hi, sweetheart.

13:26.529 --> 13:27.979
Hi. Yeah.

13:56.076 --> 13:57.077
Ew.

14:01.219 --> 14:03.325
Ew. I hate her so much.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.085
Benny used to date her,
you know.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.431
Really? When?

14:06.466 --> 14:08.088
Like, when I was a baby.

14:11.229 --> 14:13.404
Sweet Sisters reunion.

14:13.438 --> 14:15.371
Can't wait to go home.Ah.

14:15.406 --> 14:18.409
Okay, don't post that,
all right? It's super desperate.

14:18.443 --> 14:20.307
Just giving the people
what they want.

14:23.552 --> 14:24.829
Oh, Benny needs to know

14:24.864 --> 14:28.453
approximately how long your speech is gonna be for the wedding.

14:28.488 --> 14:30.524
Why? I haven't even
written it yet.

14:30.559 --> 14:32.561
Well, he's just being
a good groom.

14:32.595 --> 14:34.632
These things can drag on and on,

14:34.666 --> 14:36.565
like Marcy
at Jay and Em's wedding.

14:36.599 --> 14:41.294
She just would not shut up
about her fucking, like, lupas.

14:41.328 --> 14:43.020
You know? I'm just, like,

14:43.537 --> 14:45.125
"Shut the fuck up."

14:45.160 --> 14:46.644
You know, I had
an epiphany recently.

14:46.678 --> 14:51.200
I walked into this audition and there was a waiting room full of actresses,

14:51.235 --> 14:54.514
and I was, like,
finally confident in myself for the first time.

14:54.548 --> 14:57.482
Like, I'm okay with how I look.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.622
It's fine.

14:59.657 --> 15:01.383
Well, that's not good.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.423
So, what's this photo shoot for?
It's for, like, on airplanes?

15:08.183 --> 15:10.323
Arrivee Magazine.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.152
Okay, I really can't handle
going home right now.

15:12.187 --> 15:14.568
I'm so fat and my wedding's
in nine weeks,

15:14.603 --> 15:17.399
and mom, like,
is just in complete denial.

15:17.433 --> 15:18.607
She should be freaking out.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.231
Oh, shit.

15:22.266 --> 15:25.441
Hey, do you think you're
gonna do that show in Brooklyn?

15:25.476 --> 15:27.581
They don't want me
without you.

15:27.616 --> 15:29.445
That, "Where are they now?"
Show?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.275
No. Fuck no!

15:31.309 --> 15:33.380
I know, but I could
really use the money.

15:33.415 --> 15:35.313
We're working actresses.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.350
Not fucking former child stars.

15:38.213 --> 15:39.421
Sweet Sisters!

15:42.079 --> 15:44.012
Pfft. Okay.

15:44.046 --> 15:46.152
What's the point
of saying anything?

15:46.186 --> 15:49.293
I know. Like we're poison ivy.
You have to alert everybody.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.751
Oh.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.525
I don't like my smile in this.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.679
Oh, God. This is gruesome.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.755
Hello.

17:14.895 --> 17:16.587
Oh, yeah. I'll hold.

17:28.392 --> 17:31.084
Oh, shit, I can
never return this.

17:31.774 --> 17:33.086
Oh, boy.

18:08.363 --> 18:09.364
Oh.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.540
Oh, my God. My old library card.

18:14.196 --> 18:16.233
From 1963.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.581
Ted. Guess what I just found.

18:19.926 --> 18:21.376
Really?

18:21.410 --> 18:25.828
Yeah, I just wish they would have come
to this decision before rehearsals.

18:26.898 --> 18:27.934
Yeah.

18:27.968 --> 18:29.418
You know what, guys,

18:29.453 --> 18:31.903
this puts me in a very
uncomfortable position.

18:31.938 --> 18:34.527
You see, this twat producer,

18:34.561 --> 18:37.323
who, by the way, only happens to be, like,
five years younger than me,

18:37.357 --> 18:39.532
wants to be
my fucking son-in-law.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.465
And here's the position
I'm in now.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.122
I don't know how
to pay for the wedding.

18:43.708 --> 18:44.916
Yeah, you know what?

18:44.951 --> 18:46.711
You should have
seen this coming.

18:46.746 --> 18:48.748
Okay? That's why I pay you
the big bucks.

18:48.782 --> 18:50.508
The big clams casino.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.785
Yeah.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.511
Uh-huh. Okay. Well, fuck you.

18:53.546 --> 18:54.754
Right. Yeah. Goodbye.

18:55.789 --> 18:58.930
Stupid. Bastard. Fat ass.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.554
Punk. Pervert. Son-in-law.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.452
Clara.

19:03.487 --> 19:05.696
We should get going.God dammit.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.287
We gotta leave
in 10 minutes.

19:10.321 --> 19:11.564
What time is it?

19:23.231 --> 19:24.611
Oh.

19:24.646 --> 19:27.545
This is my cousin
Grace's new baby.

19:27.580 --> 19:31.722
Uh, they named her Louise
after her husband's mother.

19:31.756 --> 19:36.830
And her husband is the one
who died drunk driving.

19:36.865 --> 19:38.798
Mmm-hmm.Wait. Wait a minute.
No, that's not right.

19:38.832 --> 19:43.216
You know what?
He may have been the one who died from a heart attack

19:43.251 --> 19:45.218
while he was drunk driving.

19:45.253 --> 19:46.495
Do you believe that?

19:51.569 --> 19:52.570
Okay.

19:59.508 --> 20:00.578
Clara.

20:02.856 --> 20:04.410
Clara.

20:15.938 --> 20:17.423
Clara.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.425
Can you see me?

20:33.370 --> 20:35.337
Oh, gosh.

20:35.372 --> 20:38.375
The daylight.
So happy to be out...

20:38.409 --> 20:39.686
Hi, girls.RILEY: Hey.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.688
Hi.

20:41.723 --> 20:43.414
Sight for sore eyes.

20:43.449 --> 20:44.933
Thank you.

20:44.967 --> 20:46.314
How was the train ride?

20:46.348 --> 20:48.074
We were, like,
sitting in a fart box.

20:48.108 --> 20:50.490
The entire train ride
was disgusting.Yeah.

20:50.525 --> 20:51.905
Smelled like warm beans.Is it?

20:51.940 --> 20:53.976
You're making me hungry
with that fart talk.

20:54.011 --> 20:55.944
Yeah.

20:55.978 --> 20:57.325
Dad, you're so thin.

20:57.359 --> 20:58.671
Oh, I am not. I'm fat.

20:58.705 --> 21:00.880
I gotta lose, like, 25 pounds.

21:00.914 --> 21:02.813
Uh, I need help with laundry,

21:02.847 --> 21:03.848
Okay.

21:03.883 --> 21:05.919
And then, I also
need help with a bill. I just...

21:06.851 --> 21:08.301
"Help with a bill"?

21:08.336 --> 21:10.407
What? Do you need someone
to read it to you?

21:10.441 --> 21:11.925
Funny, funny.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.411
Girls, we have time
for a couple of drinks

21:14.445 --> 21:16.033
before Arrivee Magazine.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.483
Ugh!

21:17.517 --> 21:19.070
I'm not even on the cover.

21:26.388 --> 21:28.390
Cheers!

21:28.425 --> 21:29.702
To Ollie's birthday.

21:29.736 --> 21:31.980
Ollie's birthday,
and welcome home.

21:33.913 --> 21:34.914
Wow.

21:35.570 --> 21:36.916
Yes-sir-e.

21:36.950 --> 21:39.574
Those will knock your ass
right over your head.

21:39.608 --> 21:41.610
Dad's been painting, girls.

21:42.370 --> 21:43.923
Cool.

21:43.957 --> 21:45.511
It's really shit. It's like...

21:45.545 --> 21:46.615
Sorry. Hey.

21:46.650 --> 21:50.481
Can I, can I get a picture
with the three of you?

21:50.516 --> 21:53.070
Sure. Yeah.Sweet sisters.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.728
And the father.

21:55.762 --> 21:57.626
Ted Reynolds.

21:57.661 --> 22:00.974
Oh, man. It's just, like,
such a wacky, wacky world.

22:02.528 --> 22:03.667
Ted.

22:04.944 --> 22:05.979
How you been man?

22:06.739 --> 22:08.396
Yeah, been around.

22:09.466 --> 22:11.157
Uh, hey, you know, jeez louise,

22:11.191 --> 22:14.056
my son was obsessed
with you two.

22:14.091 --> 22:15.472
Oh.Oh, that's so sweet.

22:15.506 --> 22:17.612
I mean, you know,
I'd give him hell about it.

22:17.646 --> 22:19.407
Here, I'll take it.

22:19.441 --> 22:20.649
You sit down.

22:20.684 --> 22:21.788
Oh, awesome.

22:21.823 --> 22:23.169
Okay, so you're gonna sit
right there?

22:23.203 --> 22:24.722
No, you're gonna come
right back here

22:24.757 --> 22:25.827
Okay.

22:25.861 --> 22:27.415
Two thumbs up.Yep.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.589
That's good.Okay.

22:29.624 --> 22:33.490
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
One with Julie.

22:33.524 --> 22:35.561
♪ The star

22:38.564 --> 22:39.599
Yeah. Yeah.

22:39.634 --> 22:41.394
Okay, I got it. I got it.

22:41.429 --> 22:42.706
Good.Un-real.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.776
Yeah.Thanks.

22:43.810 --> 22:45.087
Ugh.Ugh.

22:45.122 --> 22:47.607
Oh, my God. Ew!

22:47.642 --> 22:48.919
Did you get a little bit
of him on you?

22:48.953 --> 22:51.473
Yeah, I got a lot of him on me.

22:51.508 --> 22:52.578
Enjoy that, honey.

22:52.612 --> 22:53.889
You guys wanna eat anything?

22:53.924 --> 22:55.097
I'm cleansing.

22:55.132 --> 22:57.203
Maybe, just an order
of fried shrimp.

22:57.237 --> 22:59.585
Mm-hmm.And some quesadilla,

22:59.619 --> 23:01.863
and, I don't know,
maybe a cob salad for the table would be good.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.555
That's all. I mean,
I think we should just eat appetizer, girls,

23:04.590 --> 23:06.005
'cause I'm gonna order
Chinese food.

23:06.039 --> 23:08.663
We should all be eating
eggplant at every meal.

23:08.697 --> 23:11.493
They say it literally
melts cancer cells.

23:11.528 --> 23:12.874
Well, that sounds yummy,

23:12.908 --> 23:14.945
but I'm not gonna go
for the eggplant right now.

23:14.979 --> 23:16.015
I think that will be it.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.085
Thank you so much.Yeah.

23:17.119 --> 23:18.397
Thank you, great.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.640
I like this waitress.

23:20.675 --> 23:23.436
And when a waitress
from 1975 can say,

23:23.471 --> 23:25.162
"A waitress nowadays is good,"

23:25.749 --> 23:26.991
she's good.

23:27.026 --> 23:29.856
Well, any waitress in Connecticut has it better than you did.

23:29.891 --> 23:32.790
Yeah, you were working in, like,
seedy shit holes in Midtown,

23:32.825 --> 23:34.620
where dudes went
to cheat on their wives.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.967
Serving shitty steak
in a leotard.

23:37.001 --> 23:38.589
That's so fucked up.

23:38.624 --> 23:41.834
Your boss was like, "Clara, come over here,
you missed a spot right on my mouth.

23:41.868 --> 23:42.800
Come on, give me a kiss."

23:42.835 --> 23:45.907
So, I really want Megan
to be a bridesmaid,

23:45.941 --> 23:49.186
but, like, she's gained
a lot of weight.

23:49.220 --> 23:52.914
I need to write an email with everyone's
goal weight on it and send it out.

23:52.948 --> 23:55.710
What the... Hey.RILEY: Hey, come back here.

23:55.744 --> 23:56.918
You stole my wallet.

23:56.952 --> 23:58.195
It's her bladder, kids.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.507
It's shot.

23:59.541 --> 24:00.922
We're old. We're falling apart.

24:00.956 --> 24:03.165
Just go ahead and
shoot me in the face.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.698
Excuse me.

24:30.986 --> 24:32.540
Not nice to stare.

24:40.893 --> 24:42.619
Clara.

24:45.069 --> 24:46.864
Girls, are you
washing your hands?

24:50.903 --> 24:52.629
Do you wash your hair
before auditions?

24:53.871 --> 24:56.011
Yeah, sometimes.

24:56.046 --> 24:57.979
I just feel like
it's really important.

24:59.912 --> 25:02.190
Don't know what to tell you sweetie,
it's a shitty business.

25:02.224 --> 25:03.432
Well, that's what it is.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.124
Oh, you know what?
I keep seeing that friend of yours

25:05.158 --> 25:06.953
on this detergent commercial.

25:06.988 --> 25:08.817
She's actually very funny.

25:08.852 --> 25:11.164
Yeah.Mara? My old roommate?

25:11.199 --> 25:12.683
Yeah, we were never friends.

25:12.718 --> 25:14.202
I hate her. She's a huge cunt.

25:14.236 --> 25:17.067
Ah, okay, well,
she's a huge funny cunt.

25:17.101 --> 25:18.724
Hey, you didn't notice my lips.

25:19.828 --> 25:21.589
Did you get 'em pumped
or whatever?

25:21.623 --> 25:22.866
They look pumped.JULIE: Yeah.

25:23.349 --> 25:24.592
Just checking...

25:26.317 --> 25:27.733
Oh, my God.

25:29.113 --> 25:31.184
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:31.219 --> 25:32.772
I was just... That was scary.

25:32.807 --> 25:35.672
Just, just checking that
you wanted the C-Cobb as well.

25:35.706 --> 25:37.743
Yeah, we...

25:37.777 --> 25:39.676
Now more than ever.
The Cobb, please.

25:39.710 --> 25:41.781
Jesus.Sorry.

25:41.816 --> 25:44.128
I think there's a Cobb salad
in my underpants.

25:44.163 --> 25:46.165
My IUD dropped out, I think.

25:47.028 --> 25:48.270
I think it's in me now.

25:50.376 --> 25:55.070
Did everyone see the flowers I posted on Pinterest for the wedding?

25:55.105 --> 25:57.763
Oh, I'm sorry, Julie,
I just haven't had time.

25:57.797 --> 26:02.181
You know, I saw something that I think would
be perfect for your wedding this morning.

26:02.215 --> 26:03.734
Honey, show 'em
the picture of what I saw.

26:03.769 --> 26:05.115
Uh, yeah.

26:06.150 --> 26:07.186
Look at that.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.774
Oh, my God.Ew.

26:08.808 --> 26:12.329
That was in our backyard
and it's for free.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.400
And I think it
will look great on the cake.

26:14.434 --> 26:16.989
Coyotes have been
awful this year.

26:17.023 --> 26:20.095
Every other week we hear
about a dog being killed.

26:20.130 --> 26:21.787
And did I tell you guys
about the little girl

26:21.821 --> 26:23.961
who was stalked on the
way home from school.

26:23.996 --> 26:25.929
I just ordered pot.

26:25.963 --> 26:27.344
From who? Poo-poo?

26:27.378 --> 26:29.967
You know it. 'Cause he got
the good shit.

26:30.002 --> 26:31.831
I'm so proud of my kids.

26:36.318 --> 26:39.425
What should we bake
for the birthday boy this year?

26:39.459 --> 26:42.808
Oh, I don't think
we need to make anything.

26:42.842 --> 26:45.707
We just ate and
we're gonna have Chinese,

26:45.742 --> 26:47.847
and I just cleaned
the kitchen last night.

26:47.882 --> 26:49.435
Relax, we'll clean it up.

26:49.469 --> 26:50.436
Yeah, it's tradition.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.852
I thought you wanted
to cleanse, Julie.

26:52.887 --> 26:55.061
Jeez, okay,
I think I look good.

26:55.096 --> 26:57.788
Okay. Home sweet home.

26:57.823 --> 26:59.756
Oh, my goodness.There he is.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.274
There's the guy.

27:01.309 --> 27:02.862
Hi, Ollie.

27:02.897 --> 27:04.899
Hi, baby.

27:04.933 --> 27:06.832
Oh, he has
a little red rocket.

27:06.866 --> 27:10.318
Aw, you can't get boners
for your sisters, Ollie.

27:10.352 --> 27:12.182
I found brownie mix.

27:12.216 --> 27:13.666
Ooh.

27:13.701 --> 27:15.254
Ooh, yummy.

27:16.151 --> 27:18.188
Hey, sweetheart, we're home.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.431
Why don't you take your
coat off and stay awhile.

27:22.502 --> 27:23.952
So, uh, for the wedding,

27:23.987 --> 27:27.231
we're gonna let the elderly people
come in and use the private bathroom.

27:27.266 --> 27:29.199
Where are the
porta-potties gonna go?

27:29.233 --> 27:30.856
Behind the garage.

27:30.890 --> 27:33.237
They're gonna be nice though.
We're splurging on the presidential trailers.

27:33.272 --> 27:34.583
Hmm.

27:34.618 --> 27:37.310
I mean that's, like,
an important thing to spend money on.

27:37.345 --> 27:39.761
Yeah.JULIE: Yeah, it's like if
someone takes a shit,

27:39.796 --> 27:43.075
then like,
they'll be fully stocked because of the attendant.

27:43.109 --> 27:45.733
Yeah, you don't want anyone walking out of there like this.

27:45.767 --> 27:47.148
Ugh, come on.Yeah, you do.

27:53.982 --> 27:58.504
Julie, um,
has Benny said how the show's going?

27:58.538 --> 28:01.093
Um, I think
he's having fun.

28:01.127 --> 28:02.957
Wow. That's nice.

28:02.991 --> 28:04.130
Let me in.

28:05.891 --> 28:07.513
Ted.

28:07.547 --> 28:10.965
I, uh, was fired
from Benny's show, Julie.

28:11.551 --> 28:13.139
What? It's okay.

28:13.174 --> 28:14.831
I'm fine. Thank you though.

28:16.522 --> 28:19.214
Yeah, up until a week ago,
they were sending flowers,

28:19.249 --> 28:22.045
and then he just
got the call today.

28:22.079 --> 28:25.945
Yeah, I guess they wanted to go a different direction with the character.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.222
Do you know anything about that?

28:27.257 --> 28:30.467
Well, yeah, but Ben said he was
gonna call you personally.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.434
Mmm-hmm, he didn't.

28:32.469 --> 28:36.473
But, that's okay, I mean,
I don't need a pep talk.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.302
What happened?

28:38.337 --> 28:41.098
Well, I guess they wanted
a Ted Reynolds type,

28:41.133 --> 28:43.169
but they didn't
actually want Ted Reynolds.

28:43.204 --> 28:45.344
Well, it wasn't Ben.
He was championing you.

28:45.378 --> 28:49.935
Yeah, you know, sweetheart,
I have a hard time trusting the old son-in-law.

28:49.969 --> 28:52.040
And by old, I do mean, old.

28:52.075 --> 28:53.559
That is so fucked up, Dad.

28:53.593 --> 28:55.319
Do not give me shit
about his age.

28:55.354 --> 28:57.356
Riley just had sex
with a 60-year-old

28:57.390 --> 28:59.116
and no one's saying anything
about that.

28:59.151 --> 29:00.566
Don't announce that
to Mom and Dad.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.809
Well, you did.

29:01.843 --> 29:03.051
He was not 60 then.

29:03.086 --> 29:05.157
And it was a blowjob, not sex.

29:06.399 --> 29:07.918
Who did they give it too?

29:07.953 --> 29:11.025
I don't know. Some swollen dick,
I don't know his name.

29:11.059 --> 29:13.337
Matt Byrne, wasn't it?
I can Google it.

29:13.372 --> 29:17.169
Oh, sweetheart, that's really sweet of you,
but no, we don't need to Google it.

29:17.203 --> 29:18.584
Yeah, fuck them.

29:18.618 --> 29:19.723
God.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.588
I don't mean your fiancee,
just the powers that be.

29:22.622 --> 29:23.831
'Kay.

29:23.865 --> 29:25.177
Come on, let's not fight.

29:25.211 --> 29:26.937
You know, come to
think of it, sweetheart,

29:26.972 --> 29:29.388
I would have liked a phone call,
that would have been nice.

29:29.422 --> 29:32.011
Mom literally just said,
"Let's not fight."

29:33.116 --> 29:34.358
Oh, I bet that's my shoe.

29:34.393 --> 29:35.946
Nope, that's definitely my pot.

29:35.981 --> 29:39.329
Okay, well,
I gotta go wipe my fanny before these magazine people show up.

29:41.849 --> 29:43.574
He is so insane.

29:43.609 --> 29:45.991
If he didn't act like
a complete psychopath

29:46.025 --> 29:49.339
and make insane demands
to the director.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.237
He wanted to be
in every other scene.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.550
And he did the, "Twat, twat,
I can't hear you" joke

29:53.584 --> 29:56.070
to her while she was trying
to give him direction.

29:56.104 --> 29:58.520
Then he did the "Eskimo Pussy"
bit on top of that.

29:58.555 --> 30:01.627
Julie, just for the sake of tonight,
can we forget about this?

30:01.661 --> 30:03.318
It wasn't even a big role.

30:03.353 --> 30:05.286
It was a potential reoccurring.

30:05.907 --> 30:07.322
Ugh! God.

30:07.357 --> 30:10.153
Oh, Mom, thank you
for meeting with the tent guy.

30:10.187 --> 30:11.188
What are you talking about?

30:11.913 --> 30:13.501
Mom. The tent guy?

30:13.535 --> 30:14.985
I told you a month ago,

30:15.020 --> 30:17.919
you needed to schedule a time to meet with him before he left town.

30:17.954 --> 30:20.542
I don't remember
having this conversation.

30:20.577 --> 30:24.270
Oh, my God, Mom.
They needed to see the yard.

30:24.305 --> 30:27.273
I-I don't... No one gives a shit
about this wedding, but me?

30:27.308 --> 30:29.068
I guess I just have to
suck it up and do it alone.

30:52.574 --> 30:55.336
It's Poo-poo. Poo-poo's here.

30:55.370 --> 30:57.338
Oh, nobody
calls me that anymore.

30:57.372 --> 30:59.927
Mom, apparently you know
of my drug dealer

30:59.961 --> 31:01.169
Mom, are you okay?

31:02.032 --> 31:04.069
Mom? Oh, hi, Joe.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.105
Hey. How you doing,
Ms. Reynolds.Oh, Joe.

31:06.140 --> 31:09.695
Oh. Joe did our
landscaping all summer.

31:09.729 --> 31:12.594
Are you crying? No, no, no, I'm fine.

31:12.629 --> 31:15.597
♪ I don't know
what I've been told

31:15.632 --> 31:18.255
♪ Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

31:18.290 --> 31:20.637
There he is. How you doing,
you old bush wacker?

31:20.671 --> 31:23.226
Oh, I'm good.You're okay? Yeah.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.606
You shouldn't sing that
in front of guests.

31:24.641 --> 31:27.575
Hey, I've heard it before. I, uh,
looking for my next big job.

31:27.609 --> 31:32.304
Oh yeah? Mr. Montalto has me cleaning out
his storage space in Deep River.

31:32.338 --> 31:34.651
How many bodies
have you found so far?

31:34.685 --> 31:36.101
You know what's crazy though,

31:36.135 --> 31:38.034
he has two pitching machines.

31:38.068 --> 31:40.657
Who would need two? I don't know.
Who would need two?

31:44.040 --> 31:45.075
So, uh,

31:45.110 --> 31:46.352
do you know we had
AP English together?

31:46.387 --> 31:47.975
Ooh, I didn't know that.

31:48.009 --> 31:50.115
Yeah, studying.Me in high school.

31:50.149 --> 31:51.875
Dark, dark times.Yeah.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.430
No, we don't talk about that.
That was really like, "Dear diary, I don't know..."

31:58.123 --> 32:00.470
Yeah, it was hysterical,
I wanted to die.

32:00.504 --> 32:01.540
You and me, both, sweetie.

32:01.574 --> 32:03.128
Joe, what do you want to drink?

32:03.162 --> 32:05.647
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you, I'm good.Oh, come on.

32:05.682 --> 32:07.649
Have a little something
to wet your whistle, huh?

32:07.684 --> 32:09.479
And you're gonna have
dinner with us too, pal.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.964
Huh, I like Moscow Mules.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.379
What the fuck
are you talking about?

32:13.414 --> 32:15.071
Sorry.RILEY: Let's smoke this.
How about that.

32:15.105 --> 32:17.142
Okay, off you go.

32:17.176 --> 32:19.351
Julie, Poo-poo's here.

32:19.385 --> 32:21.422
No poking at fannies.

32:21.456 --> 32:23.458
Oh, Ollie, come here.

32:23.493 --> 32:26.737
Oh, sweetheart, oh, honey, baby.

32:26.772 --> 32:28.153
Give me a kiss.

32:28.187 --> 32:30.431
I've been seeing
this woman around.

32:31.466 --> 32:34.435
Uh, around Old Lyme?

32:34.469 --> 32:37.300
Yeah. She seems to go
wherever I go.

32:37.334 --> 32:40.993
Well, you should say hi to her.
Maybe you guys could be friends.

32:41.028 --> 32:43.168
I think hat would be
weird at this point.

32:43.202 --> 32:45.446
Mmm, she might think
the same thing.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.311
Mmm, oh Jesus.

32:48.345 --> 32:51.762
There are those assholes
from Arrivee Magazine.

32:51.797 --> 32:54.282
They can all suck my red rocket.

32:57.423 --> 32:59.632
Hey, James.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.427
How are you, sir? How are you?

33:01.462 --> 33:04.016
Come here, come here.Thank you very much.

33:04.051 --> 33:07.330
Okay, focus, focus.

33:07.364 --> 33:09.573
Ooh, my face is really hot.
I don't like powder.

33:09.608 --> 33:11.610
They look great.
The house looks really great.

33:11.644 --> 33:13.750
More family. Like a family.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.373
This is where I play,
"How do I kill myself?"

33:16.408 --> 33:18.065
Because I can't
get out of this room.

33:18.099 --> 33:19.411
Good.Something like this, James?

33:21.413 --> 33:22.690
That's a suicide joke.

33:22.724 --> 33:25.417
This is a really
strange position for me.

33:28.282 --> 33:29.490
Oh, it's beautiful.

33:29.524 --> 33:32.113
Isn't that just the essence.Yes.

33:32.148 --> 33:36.255
So, when I say family,
what does it mean to you?

33:36.876 --> 33:38.050
Family.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.087
Ooh.

33:40.121 --> 33:42.468
Any of you can answer.

33:43.297 --> 33:44.367
Hey, Joe.Yeah.

33:44.401 --> 33:45.609
When you ordered
the Chinese food,

33:45.644 --> 33:47.818
did you get two orders
of sesame chicken?

33:47.853 --> 33:51.167
Uh... We need two orders
of sesame chicken.

33:51.201 --> 33:53.100
I'll go call 'em back.Thank you.

33:53.134 --> 33:54.687
Run like the wind.TED: I'll jump in.

33:55.654 --> 33:56.793
Gotta get this shit over with.

33:56.827 --> 33:59.244
Um, family means
everything to me.

33:59.278 --> 34:00.728
It really is...

34:00.762 --> 34:04.111
It's my whole life, I mean,
my family is my life.

34:04.145 --> 34:09.357
It's really the whipped cream
on the banana split of life.

34:09.391 --> 34:11.359
And um...

34:11.393 --> 34:14.155
You know, the girls and I,
we've been through some rough times,

34:14.190 --> 34:16.123
but we know,

34:16.157 --> 34:19.609
we'll get through them together
and we'll always be a family.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.889
Oh, that's beautiful. Wait. Ooh!

34:23.922 --> 34:26.409
Excellent. Got it.

34:27.824 --> 34:29.411
Clara.

34:29.446 --> 34:30.860
Clara, I can see you.

34:30.896 --> 34:32.208
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:32.242 --> 34:35.521
Mmm, it's okay, Mom, don't worry.
We can photoshop her out.

34:35.556 --> 34:37.764
Great. And that's a wrap.JAMES: But before we stop,

34:37.799 --> 34:40.525
I have a little side project
we can bring you into.

34:40.561 --> 34:41.596
Christ.

34:41.630 --> 34:45.462
Because I have, well,
it's very exciting news,

34:45.496 --> 34:46.601
I have a book.

34:47.739 --> 34:48.914
We'll put it up
on the shelf there.

34:48.947 --> 34:50.639
It's a very
exciting time for me.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.710
Congrats. That's awesome.Yeah, that's great.

34:52.745 --> 34:57.681
The book is comprised of photos of people,
the families, in their home, but hiding.

34:57.716 --> 34:59.787
So, they're there
but they're not there.

34:59.821 --> 35:01.237
It's a play on mise en scene.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.654
Okay. Well, good luck with that.

35:04.688 --> 35:06.034
So, you'll do it.Huh?

35:06.069 --> 35:08.692
You'll do it. So maybe,
why don't you go behind the curtain.

35:08.727 --> 35:09.900
The curtain.Yes, please.

35:09.935 --> 35:11.178
I go behind the curtain.

35:11.212 --> 35:14.146
And you pretty girl,
you can go behind that love seat.

35:14.181 --> 35:18.254
And you, other girl, you can go
behind that love seat.

35:18.288 --> 35:20.497
Quick, quick.

35:20.532 --> 35:21.912
James, is this where
you want me?

35:21.947 --> 35:23.500
Mmm, I could see your foot.

35:23.535 --> 35:25.399
Okay.We have integrity here.

35:25.433 --> 35:26.917
We must maintain the integrity.

35:26.952 --> 35:28.367
Mmm.

35:28.402 --> 35:31.819
Focus. Focus.
And, one, two...

35:37.307 --> 35:39.723
Let me in. Please.

35:39.758 --> 35:41.311
You can see me.

35:41.346 --> 35:43.313
Please.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.246
Please, let me in. Please.

35:46.213 --> 35:48.215
Please. Please.

35:49.319 --> 35:51.114
Please,
please let me in.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.844
And this is the last one.

35:58.432 --> 35:59.985
Great. Right,
that's a wrap.

36:00.019 --> 36:03.471
Beautiful.JULIE: Thank you, James.
You're so good.

36:03.506 --> 36:05.197
Aww, you're so good.

36:05.232 --> 36:07.303
Okay, terrific.
Thanks so much.

36:07.337 --> 36:08.683
The exits right out there.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.622
Now, I think when
you're done with the book,

36:16.657 --> 36:21.696
maybe you could uh, you know,
come back up and we could do a personal shoot.

36:21.731 --> 36:26.494
Sure, sure. If you write a book,
I'd love to do your author pose.

36:26.529 --> 36:28.289
Well, that's something
we could do also.

36:28.324 --> 36:30.705
Um, I wouldn't mind that.

36:32.362 --> 36:34.364
Tell me man,
how do you live and work out here at the same time?

36:34.399 --> 36:35.434
I mean, I would go nuts.

36:35.469 --> 36:36.918
Ahh, that's the trick.

36:36.953 --> 36:38.506
You don't work.

36:38.541 --> 36:40.301
Do you gold? Sail?

36:40.336 --> 36:41.440
No, I drink.

36:41.475 --> 36:42.924
Hey, hey, real quick.

36:42.959 --> 36:45.789
Do you think we could get
a quick photo of Ted and me?

36:45.824 --> 36:48.309
I have so many pictures,
it's stuck on my phone.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.415
Millions. And I never see them.

36:50.449 --> 36:52.762
It would be so nice to have
a real photo of the two of us.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.660
Uh, we just packed up.

36:54.695 --> 36:57.560
How do you print out a photo
from your phone?

36:57.594 --> 36:59.631
I just have no idea.
It's so crazy.

36:59.665 --> 37:01.667
Honey, they're trying to beat
traffic back to the city.

37:01.702 --> 37:03.324
This isn't the best time
to do that.

37:03.359 --> 37:04.981
Just one photo, one photo.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.294
It's be quick. It's be quick.
I promise.

37:07.742 --> 37:09.641
Um, I'm sorry.

37:09.675 --> 37:10.883
Mmm. Mmm.I'm sorry.

37:10.918 --> 37:13.645
Yeah. "Mmm," I know
what that means, okay.

37:13.679 --> 37:14.749
Here.What?

37:14.784 --> 37:16.061
Pinch my neck.Pinch your neck.

37:16.095 --> 37:18.443
There's... No, no, no, no, no, like this.
Like this.

37:18.477 --> 37:21.066
What are you talking about? Just, just do it.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.033
Pinch your neck.Pinch my neck.

37:23.068 --> 37:25.898
Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay.

37:25.933 --> 37:27.693
That's better.Anytime.

37:31.732 --> 37:32.974
Okay.Got it?

37:33.009 --> 37:35.667
Thank you. Thank you so much.It's great.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.949
Clara, that guy
just wanted to leave.

37:41.983 --> 37:42.950
You know,
it's really embarrassing

37:42.984 --> 37:45.021
when you harass people
at the last minute.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.816
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

37:46.850 --> 37:49.474
He likes taking pictures.
It's what he does for a living.

37:49.508 --> 37:51.338
Yes, it's what he does
for a living.

37:51.372 --> 37:53.512
He doesn't like
doing it for free.

37:53.547 --> 37:55.065
Just read the room a little,
okay?

37:55.100 --> 37:57.965
Where's the fire, Ted?
I wanted one God damn picture.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.070
You didn't ask me to be
in one of those photos.

38:00.105 --> 38:01.796
Because you don't like
getting your picture taken.

38:01.831 --> 38:03.522
Maybe I do sometimes.

38:03.557 --> 38:04.765
You just never ask.

38:04.799 --> 38:07.457
Oh, okay. All right. Poor Clara.
Boohoo.

38:07.492 --> 38:08.493
Ugh!

38:12.600 --> 38:15.914
♪ Saturday Sunday are the best

38:15.948 --> 38:19.124
♪ You don't have
to study for a test

38:19.158 --> 38:21.851
♪ You can just be you...

38:23.093 --> 38:26.027
I want my new nose to come out
like my nose here.

38:26.062 --> 38:27.995
You know, the bridge is like...

38:29.065 --> 38:30.549
It's just sexy.

38:35.002 --> 38:36.831
I think it's sad.

38:36.866 --> 38:39.075
You know, we were, like, babies.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.146
We were objectifying ourselves.

38:41.180 --> 38:45.012
Fucking entertaining America
since before we had pubes.

38:45.046 --> 38:47.428
And I got pubes early, Joe.

38:47.463 --> 38:51.501
I'm talking a huge bush by the time I was seven years old.

38:51.536 --> 38:54.918
People would come from all over the world to see this thing.

38:55.712 --> 38:57.162
Damn, right on.

38:57.196 --> 39:01.408
Yeah, every working actor has to objectify themselves,
believe it or not.

39:01.442 --> 39:04.031
I just don't believe
in doing that.

39:04.065 --> 39:05.377
Maybe you should.

39:06.551 --> 39:07.759
Must be a lot of pressure.

39:09.554 --> 39:12.764
So, Joe, give us
the shoreline goss?

39:12.798 --> 39:16.699
What's the darkest shit
that's been going down?

39:16.733 --> 39:20.116
Um, well, do you
remember Scott Worsen?

39:21.220 --> 39:23.947
The biggest shithead
in the world.

39:23.982 --> 39:25.604
Yeah.I don't remember him.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.951
Sweet Tits Sisters.
Sweet Tits Sisters.

39:27.986 --> 39:29.712
He would call us
Sweet Tits Sisters.

39:29.746 --> 39:32.956
Oh, yeah,
he had the picture of the girl with a coke can up her ass in his locker.

39:32.991 --> 39:34.130
Yeah.Yeah.

39:35.959 --> 39:37.167
He died in a boating accident.

39:42.656 --> 39:45.555
That was not what
I thought you were gonna say.

39:47.488 --> 39:49.076
That's terrible.

39:49.110 --> 39:50.629
That's sad.

39:50.664 --> 39:51.906
Sorry, didn't mean
to bring the vibe down.

39:52.907 --> 39:54.530
You didn't.

40:10.511 --> 40:11.754
Shalom.

40:12.651 --> 40:13.652
Mmm.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.456
Lovely.

40:24.491 --> 40:25.837
I really don't have to stay.

40:25.871 --> 40:27.666
Are you kidding?
It wouldn't be the same.

40:27.701 --> 40:28.805
Come on, Joe.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.875
Yeah.

40:29.910 --> 40:31.636
You're like the
salt of the Earth,

40:31.670 --> 40:34.984
just so humble, so Connecticut.

40:35.018 --> 40:38.781
So genuine,
so fragile New England.

40:38.815 --> 40:40.196
Joe, what's your mom like?

40:40.230 --> 40:41.542
Did I get enough food?

40:41.577 --> 40:42.716
TOGETHER] Yes.

40:42.750 --> 40:46.651
She, um, she worked
in the office at middle school.

40:46.685 --> 40:48.480
But, now she's a bartender
at Rocky's.

40:48.515 --> 40:50.620
Oh, I've done that.

40:50.655 --> 40:54.555
Our mom was a Playboy Bunny
at the Playboy club in New York.

40:54.590 --> 40:57.144
Not my proudest achievement.

40:57.178 --> 41:01.079
Back when you were dating Vince Granito,
the sensitive poet.

41:01.113 --> 41:03.012
I shall never give up me poetry.

41:03.702 --> 41:05.635
He was a poet?

41:05.670 --> 41:08.707
Very nice man.
We dated a year, tops.

41:08.742 --> 41:10.088
Because he was gay.

41:10.882 --> 41:12.331
No, he was not.

41:12.366 --> 41:14.851
Honey, he was totally out of the closet when I met him at Shelia's party.

41:14.886 --> 41:17.820
No, he wasn't. He was just nice.

41:17.854 --> 41:19.822
We dated about a year
and it faded out.

41:19.856 --> 41:22.687
And I have no regrets.
We're still friends.

41:22.721 --> 41:25.897
Oh, God,
please tell me he's not sending you poetry on Facebook.

41:25.931 --> 41:28.002
No, we're just friends on there.

41:28.037 --> 41:31.730
He doesn't post a lot
and he's put on a lot of weight.

41:34.837 --> 41:37.529
Riley, what happened
to that part you're up for?

41:38.288 --> 41:39.289
Oh.

41:40.152 --> 41:41.775
Oh, I, uh...

41:42.361 --> 41:43.811
Well, I didn't get it.

41:45.019 --> 41:46.573
I don't know what part
you're talking about, dad.

41:47.228 --> 41:48.678
Um...

41:48.713 --> 41:51.578
I did get a meeting
at a production office.

41:51.612 --> 41:54.822
Mmm.Um, but it was because
they thought I was Julie.

41:54.857 --> 41:56.824
What? Are you kidding me?

41:56.859 --> 41:58.446
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

41:58.481 --> 42:02.209
It was this modern office downtown with these, like,
20-year-old producers.

42:02.243 --> 42:05.661
Oh yeah, I know that place.
That's Mommy and Daddy Productions.

42:05.695 --> 42:07.007
They can suck my dick.

42:07.041 --> 42:08.836
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

42:08.871 --> 42:10.942
Oh God. Oh, wow!

42:10.976 --> 42:12.012
What happened?

42:12.046 --> 42:13.082
Broken nail.

42:13.116 --> 42:15.602
Oh, your pinky nail?
Your coke nail?

42:15.636 --> 42:18.121
My mom really enjoyed cocaine.

42:18.156 --> 42:20.917
This woman, in her day,
she was a snow plough.

42:22.781 --> 42:26.647
It was advertised as a
healthy alternative to alcohol.

42:26.682 --> 42:29.685
Uh, I'm sorry sweetie,
I don't remember cocaine advertisements.

42:29.719 --> 42:33.309
Weddings, funerals, you name the place,
the woman had coke on her face.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.345
Yeah, she had
a little vial around her neck

42:35.380 --> 42:36.864
that she was always...

42:36.899 --> 42:38.279
A drawer full of it.

42:39.902 --> 42:42.732
She used it as
baby powder when I was a baby.

42:42.767 --> 42:44.769
They're all making fun of you.

42:44.803 --> 42:47.185
Stop making fun of me!

42:55.262 --> 42:57.229
Okay.

42:57.264 --> 42:59.749
Jesus Christ, honey,
we were just joking.

43:05.721 --> 43:08.758
Has that guy, Plotkin,
emailed you about the script?

43:08.793 --> 43:10.311
Yeah, he did.
I haven't opened it yet.

43:11.105 --> 43:12.520
What is it?

43:12.555 --> 43:15.627
It's like this series about a father and daughter in Hollywood.

43:15.662 --> 43:16.870
You should be in it too.

43:16.904 --> 43:18.975
People don't even know
I'm still trying to work.

43:19.010 --> 43:21.046
Hey, Benny looks out
for you all the time.

43:21.081 --> 43:23.704
I appreciate
all that Benny does,

43:23.739 --> 43:27.915
but when you put out an article out when
you're 15 about how you're never acting again

43:27.950 --> 43:29.261
I guess people remember that.

43:29.296 --> 43:31.056
I knew that was a bad idea
when you did that.

43:31.091 --> 43:32.782
I hated that.

43:32.817 --> 43:35.336
Well, it was clearly
a cry for help, Dad.

43:35.371 --> 43:36.406
Well, okay.

43:36.441 --> 43:38.270
Ugh. Those were the dark ages.

43:38.305 --> 43:40.825
We literally weren't allowed
to go through puberty.

43:40.859 --> 43:42.378
Oh, come on.

43:42.412 --> 43:43.862
Always down playing.

43:43.897 --> 43:47.901
The sound guy on Sweet Sisters used
to tape our tits with an ace bandage

43:47.935 --> 43:49.350
to hide out little bumps.

43:49.385 --> 43:52.146
Okay, I believe you.
So, what do you want me to do about it now?

43:52.181 --> 43:53.872
Well, don't run off
to Studio City.

44:40.298 --> 44:42.507
Joe, do you like watermelon?

44:42.541 --> 44:45.303
Yeah.I have a new way of cutting it.

44:45.337 --> 44:46.994
I saw a video. Wanna see?

44:47.408 --> 44:49.445
Yeah, okay.

Hey, Dad, you know,
Jinky's in Studio City

44:52.068 --> 44:54.761
is by far the best breakfast.

44:54.795 --> 44:59.144
You gotta go there.
The omelets are the size of your ass.

44:59.179 --> 45:03.183
What a lame place to run off too
to start a new life.

45:03.217 --> 45:05.323
I wanna live
near Universal Studios

45:05.357 --> 45:08.844
and ride the rides.

45:08.878 --> 45:12.468
First, you pierce the skin
of the melon with your knife.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.989
Then you cut horizontally

45:16.023 --> 45:17.853
and vertically.

45:17.887 --> 45:19.889
And then you, ever so gently,

45:19.924 --> 45:24.480
scoop the flesh of the melon
into your wonderful bowl.

45:24.514 --> 45:27.000
These mixing bowls
are just spectacular.

45:27.034 --> 45:28.967
My friend in Westport
makes them.

45:29.002 --> 45:31.142

45:31.176 --> 45:33.420

you did impressions.I'm not that great.

45:34.386 --> 45:36.285
Let's try this out. Yeah.

45:37.424 --> 45:38.977
Mmm.

45:41.566 --> 45:44.811
Hey, I saw you had a book loaned to
you by the historical society upstairs.

45:44.845 --> 45:47.572
Oh, that means my girls
let you in my office?

45:47.606 --> 45:49.229
Ugh, so embarrassed.

45:49.263 --> 45:52.473
Oh, I don't care.
I'm kinda a pack rat myself.

45:52.508 --> 45:53.958
Ah, this is kinda embarrassing.

45:53.992 --> 45:56.167
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.

45:56.201 --> 45:58.825
I have so many mugs
under my bed.

45:58.859 --> 46:00.827
You know, the ones that
kinda meant something to me.

46:00.861 --> 46:05.279
Like, my grandpa always used to use this one that just said,
"Not today" on it.

46:05.314 --> 46:07.040
And, I just kinda
like that shit.

46:07.074 --> 46:10.008
Sorry, crap.I like mugs, they're fun.

46:10.043 --> 46:13.874
Anyway, my dad is actually a member of the Historical Society

46:13.909 --> 46:16.187

46:23.090 --> 46:24.333
Uh, Adelia.

I saw a special about a month ago,
but I've been a fan since 2013.

50:12.561 --> 50:15.633
Oh, wow, jeez,
the guy's been in the business a long time, I guess.

50:15.667 --> 50:17.738
Yeah, he has this, uh, this bit,

50:17.773 --> 50:21.604
where he's playing fish in a fish tank, like,
judging the people.

50:21.639 --> 50:23.296
And he's like this.

50:23.330 --> 50:24.952
There's two fish, and he's like,

50:24.987 --> 50:28.335
"Look at this guy, he's making us watch him eat a Pokeball.
That's just wrong.

50:28.370 --> 50:29.716
Well, what's a Pokeball?"

50:29.750 --> 50:32.443
And the Angel fish
is the most dramatic fish.

50:32.477 --> 50:34.376
So, he's like, "I don't know
what a Pokeball is,

50:34.410 --> 50:37.275
"but I do know that's
the flesh of our kind."

50:37.310 --> 50:40.244

52:44.920 --> 52:48.234

I don't know, there's not
a whole lot on record,

52:49.718 --> 52:50.995

a thing about...

52:51.029 --> 52:53.411

52:53.446 --> 52:55.448

52:55.482 --> 52:59.624

I think?

52:59.659 --> 53:00.901
What happened to her?

53:00.936 --> 53:02.420
I think I still follow her,
I'm not sure.

53:02.455 --> 53:04.319
She's cool She's, like,
an artist.

53:04.353 --> 53:05.561
Yeah, she's really indie.

53:05.596 --> 53:08.357
They sent her to
a mental institution, but,

53:08.392 --> 53:10.083
after that, nobody really knows.

53:10.117 --> 53:13.707
The Captain built this whole house for
her and she never even really lived here.

53:13.742 --> 53:17.366
But then, the Captain
went to the woods,

53:17.401 --> 53:19.541
where she used to walk,
and he killed himself.

53:19.575 --> 53:23.683
It's so funny how people were killing themselves back then too,
you know.

53:23.717 --> 53:25.478
You know, you shouldn't be
in an acting class.

53:25.512 --> 53:26.962
You should just be
out there auditioning.

53:26.996 --> 53:28.722
That's how you learn to act.

53:28.757 --> 53:33.279
I auditioned at Leon Silberman's house the other day.

53:33.313 --> 53:35.039
What? RILEY: Wow.

53:35.073 --> 53:38.732
Well, when was, what happened?
What... How did it go?

53:38.767 --> 53:41.977
Um, yeah, just happened,
so I don't wanna jinx anything.

53:42.011 --> 53:43.634
Well, what did you do
for the audition?

53:43.668 --> 53:45.808
Uh, just this monologue.

53:45.843 --> 53:47.776
Yeah, about what?

53:47.810 --> 53:50.641
I don't know.
I didn't get the full script.

53:50.675 --> 53:52.919
Oh, well, honey,
that's no reason not to know the material.

53:52.953 --> 53:55.784
Did you tell him
that you're my daughter?

53:55.818 --> 53:57.751
No, of course not.

53:57.786 --> 53:59.339
Well, why not?

53:59.374 --> 54:01.859
Because, I know he knows.

54:01.893 --> 54:05.690
Yeah, it's an awkward thing to say sometimes,
just out of nowhere.

54:05.725 --> 54:07.036
Yeah, I'm not talking to you.

54:07.071 --> 54:08.245
Okay, just, fuck off.

54:08.279 --> 54:11.282
Hey, let's just have fun.
Joe and I wanna have fun, right?

54:11.317 --> 54:13.802
Honey, I'm just excited
for you, that's all.

54:13.836 --> 54:15.631
I would love to hear
the monologue.

54:15.666 --> 54:19.911
Hey, let's do
a seance for Adelia.

54:19.946 --> 54:20.947
Hey.

54:20.981 --> 54:24.295
Look, she's balancing
the glass on my head.

54:24.330 --> 54:25.814
I'm excited too, Julie.

54:25.848 --> 54:28.748
It reminds me of when
I auditioned for Robert Frances.

54:28.782 --> 54:31.475
He's not super famous,
but it was a really cool thing.

54:31.509 --> 54:34.685
Okay, sweetheart,
it really doesn't count if you were naked when you auditioned.

55:17.831 --> 55:20.800
'Cause of our childhood,
I feel like I have this warped idea of adulthood.

55:20.834 --> 55:24.666
And I've realized that
just because you ride old dick,

55:24.700 --> 55:25.943
doesn't make you any older.

55:26.530 --> 55:28.048
You know.

55:28.083 --> 55:30.879
I dated a senior when
I was a freshman at UCONN.

55:30.913 --> 55:32.121
Are you an Aries?

55:32.156 --> 55:33.399
Nope.

55:33.433 --> 55:34.745
Libra? No.

55:34.779 --> 55:35.987
The Year of the Dragon.

55:36.609 --> 55:37.851
The best one.

55:37.886 --> 55:41.027
Julie. I really wanna
hear this monologue.

55:41.061 --> 55:42.097
I really do.

55:42.856 --> 55:44.513
Why? Because.

55:44.548 --> 55:46.653
Because I'm a proud dad.

55:46.688 --> 55:48.517
Come on, get up here. Come on.

55:48.552 --> 55:50.416
We support you, Julie.

55:50.450 --> 55:52.521
Up you go,
you got lots of support.

55:52.556 --> 55:55.800
Loving family here watching you.

55:55.835 --> 55:57.008
Let's see what you got.

55:58.044 --> 55:59.183
Where's my eye line?

55:59.217 --> 56:01.392
Your eye line
is right out there.

56:01.427 --> 56:03.463
That's where your audience is.
Sheesh.

56:03.498 --> 56:04.844
Thought I had
taught you how to act.

56:06.639 --> 56:08.641
There you go.

56:12.438 --> 56:16.027
I didn't come here because
I thought I was better

56:16.062 --> 56:17.788
than anyone else... Let me know when
you're gonna start.

56:19.583 --> 56:20.929
She was doing it.All right.

56:23.932 --> 56:25.485
I didn't come here

56:25.520 --> 56:28.626
because I thought I was
better than anyone else.

56:30.904 --> 56:33.148
I came here because
I thought I loved you.

56:34.977 --> 56:36.151
That night.

56:36.185 --> 56:39.188
I felt like I was
going to pass out

56:39.223 --> 56:42.916
from frustration and pleasure
at the same time.

56:44.159 --> 56:46.713
I know I'm not safe with you.

56:47.956 --> 56:50.027
I know you don't look at me

56:50.061 --> 56:52.478
and I don't want you to.

56:52.512 --> 56:53.858
I need a change.

56:54.687 --> 56:56.205
Get out of Manhattan.

56:57.586 --> 56:58.829
Get out of here.

56:59.968 --> 57:02.971
Or I could stay
depending on you.

57:03.903 --> 57:04.904
You.

57:05.767 --> 57:08.494
It's all on you!

57:10.910 --> 57:12.083
God.

57:12.118 --> 57:15.501
If you could just forgive
the shit that I put you through.

57:17.951 --> 57:19.643
But here's the thing.

57:20.540 --> 57:22.128
I do see things.

57:22.749 --> 57:24.061
I do.

57:24.095 --> 57:25.096
Signs.

57:29.929 --> 57:30.930
That's it.

57:33.933 --> 57:34.934
That's it?

57:35.831 --> 57:37.626
No, it's not the whole thing.

57:37.661 --> 57:40.042
It's just the monologue
that I auditioned with.

57:40.836 --> 57:41.906
Oh.

57:44.288 --> 57:46.670
Well, jeez that was worth it.

57:46.704 --> 57:49.258
Well, it's not,
it's not you, honey,

57:49.293 --> 57:50.846
that was great.

57:50.881 --> 57:53.297
It's, it's really his writing.

57:53.331 --> 57:59.821
Joe, would you rather marry me
but I'm really mean to you,

57:59.855 --> 58:01.478
but a great lay,

58:02.133 --> 58:04.722
or Cindy Crawford

58:04.757 --> 58:07.242
but, you can only see her
on your wedding day.

58:07.276 --> 58:09.175
It's like a
twilight zone episode.

58:09.209 --> 58:13.317
You're married to a supermodel
you can't even see.

58:13.351 --> 58:14.870
Hmm.

58:14.905 --> 58:17.528
I just kinda feel like the
guy's writing has gone soft.

58:17.563 --> 58:19.219
I think he's gone soft.

58:19.254 --> 58:21.325
You know, I mean,
of course he's still brilliant.

58:21.359 --> 58:24.155
Uh, you know, I'm never
gonna say he's not brilliant.

58:24.190 --> 58:25.916
But it's not like the old stuff.

58:25.950 --> 58:27.573
And I'm not the
only one that says that.

58:28.643 --> 58:30.092
Who's distributing
this thing?

58:30.127 --> 58:33.061
I think its for online
like an online network.

58:33.095 --> 58:35.960
Oh, my God, I can't believe
he's pandering to internet shit.

58:35.995 --> 58:37.410
Come on.

58:37.444 --> 58:39.343
Yeah, okay,
let's just stop fucking talking about it, all right?

58:39.377 --> 58:41.621
You're jealous and
it's completely transparent.

58:41.656 --> 58:43.658
There's no fucking
telling you anything.

58:43.692 --> 58:45.694
Who's Cindy Crawford?I'm jealous?

58:45.729 --> 58:47.903
How is that possible?
I am your father.

58:47.938 --> 58:49.836
Fathers aren't jealous
of their kids.

58:49.871 --> 58:52.011
Okay, only our entire lives.

58:52.045 --> 58:53.599
Okay, fine, here we go.

58:53.633 --> 58:54.979
We got the show and you didn't.

58:55.014 --> 58:58.224
Since we got one fucking stupid job,
you wouldn't forget it.

58:58.258 --> 58:59.570
Riley wrote the book about it.

59:01.054 --> 59:03.850
Riley wrote an e-book about it.

59:04.299 --> 59:06.094
That's hurtful.

59:06.128 --> 59:08.337
I say we sober up, hmm.

59:08.372 --> 59:11.789
TOGETHER] 31, 32, 33.

59:14.412 --> 59:15.828
Yeah! It burns.

59:15.862 --> 59:18.209
It burns.It burns. It burns.

59:18.244 --> 59:19.659
She's a priest.

59:19.694 --> 59:22.075
Your mother's in here, Clarice,
would you like to leave her a message?

59:22.110 --> 59:24.388
I'll make sure she gets it.What a lovey day
for an exorcism.

59:24.422 --> 59:26.632
Okay, it's my turn.
It's my turn.

59:26.666 --> 59:28.116
All right, yeah, you got this.

59:28.150 --> 59:30.601
It's my turn.All right. Okay.
Present to the judges.

59:30.636 --> 59:31.913
If you would, deep breath.

59:32.810 --> 59:34.294
This is for you, Benny.

59:34.329 --> 59:35.951
Benny. Benny can take gas.

59:35.986 --> 59:38.678
TOGETHER] One, two, three,

59:38.713 --> 59:39.990
four...

59:40.024 --> 59:41.301
Aww.

59:41.336 --> 59:44.615
Oh, no.That is so cold.

59:44.650 --> 59:46.375
It's supposed
to be cold, honey.

59:46.410 --> 59:48.343
Clara you're next. Let's go.

59:50.172 --> 59:53.417
Actually, you know what,
honey, I'm gonna go. I'm going.

59:53.451 --> 59:55.108
You know what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna do it,

59:55.143 --> 59:56.972
and then we're
gonna see Joe do it,

59:57.007 --> 59:58.940
and see if he can beat my time.

59:58.974 --> 01:00:01.252
And if you can,
500 bucks for you.

01:00:01.287 --> 01:00:03.807
500 dollars?
All right, shit, let's do it.

01:00:03.841 --> 01:00:05.809
He's so excited.

01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:09.157
Okay, here we go.

01:00:09.191 --> 01:00:10.883
Oh, one,

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:12.298
two, three...

01:00:12.332 --> 01:00:13.920
Dad, your butt crack's out.

01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:16.785
I don't know
where I'm I right now?

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.994
Oh!

01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:21.134
Five, four, three, and he's in.

01:00:21.169 --> 01:00:24.897
One, two, three,
four, five...

01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:26.830
Okay, that's good.
You're doing it.

01:00:26.864 --> 01:00:28.314
Hold on there, pal.

01:00:28.348 --> 01:00:30.765
Nope. Get back in there.

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:33.284
Just think of a Matt Byrne joke.

01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:34.907
You can do more than that.

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:35.908
Focus.TED: Come on.

01:00:35.942 --> 01:00:38.911
Dad, you should let him up.
He's drowning.

01:00:38.945 --> 01:00:40.913
Hey, he's fine. Relax.

01:00:40.947 --> 01:00:42.155
He's good.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:45.089
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

01:00:45.124 --> 01:00:47.022
Didn't really go very well,
did it?

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:49.093
That's okay.
We'll take a little breather,

01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:50.301
and we'll try it
again a little later.

01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:51.958
Yeah, we'll do it later.Seance time.

01:00:51.993 --> 01:00:54.271
Seance? Seance.

01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:56.929
Seance time. That's right.

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:58.275
I think I gotta go home soon.

01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:00.346
Oh, shut the fuck up.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.452
We're gonna fill our glasses and we're gonna have ourselves a seance.

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:07.042
We're gonna have a seance.
We're gonna have a seance.

01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:08.285
Seance. Seance. Seance.

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:42.940
They say if you stare
at a flame for too long,

01:01:42.975 --> 01:01:46.150
you'll go crazy
and start seeing fire...

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:48.118
...where there's
no fire.

01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:51.328
Joe, I wanna read your palm.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.331
Oh.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.091
Okay.

01:01:57.368 --> 01:02:01.062
So, this here is your heart line

01:02:01.096 --> 01:02:03.478
and it runs horizontally.

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:07.206
And this line here
is your head line,

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.518
it runs across your palm.

01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:12.452
That's about your state of mind.

01:02:12.487 --> 01:02:16.491
And then this one
is your life line.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:19.045
It's not about
how long you live.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.153
Like, a lot of people think
it's about how you live.

01:02:23.187 --> 01:02:27.985
Your vitality, your prosperity,
and your strength.

01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:31.368
Okay, uh, Clara,

01:02:31.402 --> 01:02:32.645
just to give you
a little update,

01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:35.544
they do have a shoe in custody
down at the police station.

01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:38.858
Uh, they have it in the tank,
they're gonna interrogate it for a little while.

01:02:38.893 --> 01:02:41.896
But they may ask you to come down and take a look at a line-up.

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.208
I feel like Benny wants me
to look like this.

01:02:46.107 --> 01:02:48.350
What's... Is that
his ex-girlfriend look like...

01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:49.938
I want my shoe.

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:53.045
Yeah, well honey,
I want that part in the show that Benny fired me from,

01:02:53.079 --> 01:02:56.358
but sometimes the things we want just kinda walk away from us,
don't they?

01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:57.635
Seance time.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.362
I'm not down here complaining
about how I wasn't even cast

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:02.917
in the series you two
are apparently doing.

01:03:02.951 --> 01:03:05.851
Hey, you know, sweetheart,
the problem with you,

01:03:05.885 --> 01:03:08.923
is that you're trying to be
a Jack of all trades right now,

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.407
which I think is wonderful,

01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:13.099
but, you know, when people
want you for something,

01:03:13.134 --> 01:03:17.207
they don't think of you in that particular way,
you know what I mean?

01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:19.519
Okay, privileged white man.

01:03:19.554 --> 01:03:21.590
Oh, shit! I like to think of my brand

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:24.835
as having more to offer
than just one thing.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.320
All right.
I'm just telling you this because I love you, sweetie.

01:03:27.355 --> 01:03:28.770
You and Julie don't get it.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.842
All you care about is money and offers and how they treating you.

01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:35.466
You don't care about process,
it's not art to you like it is for me, okay?

01:03:35.501 --> 01:03:39.574
Uh, what about that fucking kickstarter I donated 5,000 dollars to?

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:40.644
What happened to that?

01:03:40.678 --> 01:03:42.577
I, uh, donated twice that.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.303
Again, process.

01:03:44.337 --> 01:03:47.547
Okay, well, let's not argue,
all right?

01:03:47.582 --> 01:03:50.550
Yeah, I wouldn't want you to run to Studio City for three years,

01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:52.345
renting a weird porn house.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.279
Okay, I guess Dad's a very,
very bad man.

01:03:55.314 --> 01:03:57.488
Riley, that kickstarter...

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.974
Come on. What the hell was that?

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:03.356
Like, for you to take a trip
so you can get an idea

01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:04.599
to be inspired?

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:07.015
It's so entitled.

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:08.879
I'm sorry, but,

01:04:08.914 --> 01:04:10.156
it's gross.

01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:14.022
Well, why don't we all clasp
our hands together, shall we?

01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:16.093
Clara, your hand, please.

01:04:16.128 --> 01:04:17.992
Let us close thine eyes

01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:21.167
for we are about to make contact
with Amelia.

01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:23.307
Adelia.Adelia.

01:04:24.446 --> 01:04:26.586
Joe, show me how
you make a Moscow Mule?

01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:29.106
Oh, perfect, yes, Joe.

01:04:29.141 --> 01:04:33.559
Do make my wife another drink.
That's exactly what she needs, I think.

01:04:33.593 --> 01:04:35.699
Moscow Mule, Joe.

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:38.667
♪ Joe and the Moscow Mules

01:04:38.702 --> 01:04:42.326
♪ Take it away Joey

01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:44.328
What are you doing,
Ms. Reynolds?

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:46.434
♪ You take it away now Joey...

01:04:49.747 --> 01:04:53.268
They're better in copper mugs,
but, here you go.

01:04:53.303 --> 01:04:55.961
Joe, I'm not that picky.

01:04:55.995 --> 01:04:58.101
You know that about me by now.

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.382
Mmm.

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:08.697
Do you want anything to eat?

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:11.079
They made brownies in the kitchen and they didn't eat them.

01:05:15.152 --> 01:05:18.190
Hey, why'd you
lock 'em in the basement?

01:05:18.224 --> 01:05:20.399
Is that some kind of
family inside joke?

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:24.575
Hello?

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.304
Jesus, God!

01:05:29.339 --> 01:05:30.996
These taste like shit.

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.170
Riley cannot make brownies.

01:05:33.205 --> 01:05:37.243
Taste. I don't know if she used rotten eggs,
or bad oil.

01:05:37.278 --> 01:05:39.383
I don't really know
how they could be helped.

01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:41.592
You know.

01:05:41.627 --> 01:05:43.146
I worry
about that kid.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.148
She's just...

01:05:45.182 --> 01:05:47.667
She just doesn't seem to...

01:05:47.702 --> 01:05:52.086
Oh. You okay?
Here, use this as your barf bag. I'm sorry.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.501
Sorry.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:21.632
Hmm.

01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:33.058
If there's someone here with us,

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:36.199
please make a noise.

01:06:36.233 --> 01:06:37.614
Any noise will do.

01:06:39.788 --> 01:06:42.481
Any noise you like, sugar tits.

01:06:44.103 --> 01:06:47.210
That's so tight, you can see
her pussy from behind.

01:06:47.244 --> 01:06:48.625
Remember the Mel Gibson tape?

01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:51.628
Doh! No! That's a quote from
What Women Want.

01:06:51.662 --> 01:06:54.251
Oh! Please, come on.
Let's take this seriously.

01:06:54.286 --> 01:06:57.806
We're doing a seance down here.
Now, come on.

01:06:57.841 --> 01:06:59.774
You want to be very quiet now.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:02.397
Let's see if the spirits
will make a noise for us.

01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:07.506
What? Oh, God!

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.197
Did you hear that?

01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:10.543
Something's with us.

01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:12.718
This sucks.

01:07:12.752 --> 01:07:14.513
Do you wanna try out my "At home" laser kit that Benny got me?

01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:15.686
I guess so.

01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:17.481
Well,

01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:19.380
I'll tell you this much.

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:22.383
I'd love to have some of them
brownies right about now.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.420
It's stuck.

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:32.013
Okay.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:38.813
Ooh, maybe the spirits in this room don't want us to get out.

01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:41.091
The door is stuck.

01:07:43.714 --> 01:07:45.095
No, it's not.

01:07:47.684 --> 01:07:49.237
Shit.

01:07:49.272 --> 01:07:51.343
It feels like it's latched
from the other side.

01:07:51.377 --> 01:07:53.655
How the fuck did that happen?

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.692
Which one of you brainiacs
did that?

01:07:56.727 --> 01:07:58.177
Clara!

01:07:58.798 --> 01:07:59.937
Clara!

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.282
Woah! Ah!

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:35.765
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Joe.

01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:37.872
I was excited. I'll calm down.

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:41.426
Joe, here.

01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:48.572
Oh, Joe.

01:08:48.607 --> 01:08:51.334
Look at that.
Do you see that, Joe?

01:08:51.368 --> 01:08:52.921
Do you see that?

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.337
I think I should go.

01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:58.617
Oh, Joe. Sweet Joe.

01:08:58.651 --> 01:09:00.170
Help me find my shoe.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.551
I'm sorry, Ms. Reynolds.

01:09:04.312 --> 01:09:06.211
Help me let them out then.

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:07.660
That latch does stick.

01:09:09.455 --> 01:09:11.250
Okay, but then I wanna go home.Okay.

01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:26.403
Hey. I got an idea.

01:09:26.438 --> 01:09:29.441
Why don't we think
of a funny Matt Byrne bit.

01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:33.307
Hey, do you guys
remember the one

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:36.344
where he accidentally puts
his girlfriend's underpants on?

01:09:36.379 --> 01:09:38.001
And then he goes to a park.

01:09:38.035 --> 01:09:40.417
And then, he's in
the men's room,

01:09:40.452 --> 01:09:45.629
and his boss sydelles up next to him and he sees the girl's underpants.

01:09:53.706 --> 01:09:55.536
No, maybe, you wouldn't
have been fired

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:59.919
if you hadn't told the director the only reason
she was hired was 'cause she's a woman.

01:09:59.954 --> 01:10:02.819
I never said "woman."
I called her a little girl.

01:10:02.853 --> 01:10:04.441
She was, like, 25 years old.

01:10:08.065 --> 01:10:09.964
Is that why Benny said
I was fired?

01:10:24.047 --> 01:10:25.842
In case we need it for the door.

01:10:32.849 --> 01:10:36.611
You have to respect women
in this business and children.

01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:38.544
Especially when
they're your own children.

01:10:38.579 --> 01:10:40.995
Oh! Lord!

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:42.962
A pox your throat.

01:10:42.997 --> 01:10:46.483
You bowling, blasphemous,
infamous fool.

01:10:47.864 --> 01:10:51.385
No more rent money
for you this month, Missy.

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:55.354
Maybe you gonna have to go out and work for a living for a change.

01:10:55.389 --> 01:10:57.494
That's really tragic
considering your age,

01:10:57.529 --> 01:10:59.496
I mean, you're almost 30.

01:10:59.531 --> 01:11:00.808
You shouldn't be
out there working,

01:11:00.842 --> 01:11:04.536
you should be swinging with the other children on the play set.

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:05.709
Stupid baby.

01:11:06.883 --> 01:11:08.264
Oh, just shut up!

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:11.853
Who said that?

01:11:22.139 --> 01:11:23.313
What are you doing?

01:11:25.902 --> 01:11:27.421
Mrs. Reynolds, what are you...
Hey!

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:28.732
No.

01:11:29.008 --> 01:11:30.527
No.

01:11:30.562 --> 01:11:31.701
What are you doing?

01:11:32.529 --> 01:11:33.668
What is going on?

01:11:35.498 --> 01:11:36.809
I didn't mean to.

01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:44.334
Joe, don't open the door.

01:11:45.818 --> 01:11:48.096
It's safer that way. Go home.

01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:49.512
I-I won't tell anyone.

01:11:50.513 --> 01:11:51.652
I just wanna go to bed.

01:11:53.964 --> 01:11:56.001
I'm sorry, I just thought
I'd make a little cash.

01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:57.347
I didn't know
it would be like this.

01:11:58.555 --> 01:11:59.729
I'd really...

01:11:59.763 --> 01:12:00.937
I do like you, Clara.

01:12:00.971 --> 01:12:03.008
I think you deserve
love and respect.

01:12:08.841 --> 01:12:10.118
Are you all okay in there?

01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:11.948
Clara?

01:12:11.982 --> 01:12:14.019
Clara, the door's locked.

01:12:14.053 --> 01:12:16.849
Could you help us out here,
please sweetie?

01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:19.473
I'm worried.
I let someone in the house.

01:12:19.507 --> 01:12:21.164
Unlock the fucking door, Mom.

01:12:21.198 --> 01:12:22.579
You're being a bitch.

01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:24.616
No, no, listen to me.

01:12:25.444 --> 01:12:26.997
She's inside me.

01:12:27.653 --> 01:12:29.034
And,

01:12:29.068 --> 01:12:30.794
she's sick.

01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:32.520
She's not well.

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.764
What? TED: Okay,

01:12:34.798 --> 01:12:37.560
...very funny. You and Joe
smoked a little wacky weed.

01:12:37.594 --> 01:12:39.976
That's fine. I'm not mad.
Just open the door.

01:12:40.977 --> 01:12:42.910
Okay.

01:12:42.944 --> 01:12:44.083
I'll get help.

01:12:44.118 --> 01:12:45.982
Help to undo the door.

01:12:46.016 --> 01:12:47.673
Okay, thanks sweetie.

01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:49.986
Um, do me a favor,
don't get Mr. Montalto.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.919
Can't deal with
that prick right now.

01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:24.917
Okay, well...

01:13:24.952 --> 01:13:28.921
I didn't wanna ruin this door
but looks like I have no choice.

01:13:28.956 --> 01:13:30.578
It's okay, girls. Yeah.

01:13:30.613 --> 01:13:32.477
You can just stay where you are.
Don't worry.

01:13:33.029 --> 01:13:34.133
I got this.

01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:41.727
Ow! Oh!

01:13:45.662 --> 01:13:46.939
You're welcome, girls.

01:13:48.113 --> 01:13:49.494
You're welcome.

01:13:50.978 --> 01:13:51.979
Mom!

01:13:52.566 --> 01:13:53.912
What the fuck.

01:13:53.946 --> 01:13:54.947
Where is she?

01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:00.746
Hello? Mom.

01:14:03.266 --> 01:14:04.716
Ugh!

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:10.791
Oh, my God!

01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:14.864
My wedding is in nice weeks.

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:20.973
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right at ya.

01:14:21.008 --> 01:14:22.975
Right in your eyes.

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:26.703
The thing about a shark's eyes,
is the lifeless eyes.

01:14:26.738 --> 01:14:29.257
Black, doll's eyes.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.845
I think I just saw a coyote.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.744
And then he comes at you.

01:14:32.778 --> 01:14:34.608
Doesn't even seem to be living.

01:14:35.816 --> 01:14:37.645
Till he bites you.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.267
Oh, and then
those black eyes...

01:14:39.302 --> 01:14:41.269
Mom hasn't done shit
to clean up her office.

01:14:41.304 --> 01:14:43.306
Benny's gonna be so mad at me.

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.653
Why are we out here? We needed air.

01:14:45.688 --> 01:14:47.275
The ocean turns red.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:51.072
You hear that horrible,
high-pitched screaming...

01:14:51.107 --> 01:14:54.041
Do you remember that
Daddy Yankee song Gasolina

01:14:54.075 --> 01:14:56.112
that we loved so much
in high school?

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.941
Yeah.

01:14:59.046 --> 01:15:00.875
Benny doesn't even remember it.

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:02.774
'Cause he was 40
when it came out.

01:15:04.085 --> 01:15:06.536
It's okay.
It's not the best song.

01:15:12.853 --> 01:15:16.684
Probably up there,
burrowing in her receipts.

01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:19.722
Julie, will you please do
that show in Brooklyn with me?

01:15:19.756 --> 01:15:22.345
I know it's embarrassing,
but it could be really fun,

01:15:22.379 --> 01:15:25.797
and I could really use
the money right now, honestly.

01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:27.108
Riley,

01:15:27.143 --> 01:15:30.629
you have to learn to say no to things that you don't wanna do.

01:15:30.664 --> 01:15:32.631
That's how you get the things
that you do want.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.944
Okay, but I'm not
in the same boat as you.

01:15:34.978 --> 01:15:37.222
I can't just say no
because I don't want it.Sorry.

01:15:37.256 --> 01:15:39.086
It's too embarrassing, okay?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.708
You gotta let go
of the Sweet Sisters.

01:15:40.743 --> 01:15:42.745
Uh, "Let it go," yeah, I have.

01:15:42.779 --> 01:15:45.817
I've tried. I've tried to forget
it ever happened.

01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:48.026
It did nothing good for me.Or me.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.028
Yeah, but you managed
to work afterwards,

01:15:50.062 --> 01:15:51.754
whereas, I, yeah, I have to do

01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:54.032
the, "Look what she looks like now" shit over and over.

01:15:54.066 --> 01:15:57.242
And yeah, I don't like it.
It's depressing. It's not all I have.

01:15:57.276 --> 01:15:58.623
Riley!

01:16:01.004 --> 01:16:02.178
Oh, my God.

01:16:02.212 --> 01:16:03.593
Are you all right?

01:16:04.767 --> 01:16:07.010
I-I think so.Wow.

01:16:07.045 --> 01:16:08.287
What happened?

01:16:08.322 --> 01:16:11.359
The flower pot
almost fell on Riley.

01:16:11.394 --> 01:16:14.673
Uh, what's with
the knife there, Lorena Bobbitt.

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:17.089
I was cutting watermelon
with Joe,

01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:18.919
and he had to go home.

01:16:19.816 --> 01:16:21.059
You're high.

01:16:21.093 --> 01:16:22.267
She's totally high, right?

01:16:23.855 --> 01:16:26.720
Julie, what happened
to your face?

01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:29.895
W-What do you mean?

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.828
It's not your face anymore.

01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:32.795
It's been butchered.

01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:37.178
You've paid doctors
to slice up your face,

01:16:37.213 --> 01:16:39.215
and it doesn't look good, honey.

01:16:39.249 --> 01:16:42.252
It looks bad. It's one
of those fake faces.

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:44.427
That's what you have now,
is a fake face.

01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:47.154
Okay, you know,
I think maybe we've had a little too much to drink.

01:16:47.188 --> 01:16:50.778
And your lips.
Whose lips are those?

01:16:50.813 --> 01:16:53.954
Who do they belong to?
They're not your lips.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:56.888
Come into this world
with a beautiful face,

01:16:58.268 --> 01:17:00.408
and you wanna slice it all up.

01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:03.998
Who do you belong to?

01:17:04.033 --> 01:17:06.069
Okay, all right, this is...
That's enough of this.

01:17:06.104 --> 01:17:08.727
Let me have it.
Let me have the knife.Get off of me.

01:17:08.762 --> 01:17:10.384
Let...

01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:13.180
Jesus.And you. You're the
worst of them.

01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:14.871
How? You know me.

01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:16.804
You knew me.

01:17:17.874 --> 01:17:19.117
Girls.

01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:21.464
I think your mom
needs a little water.

01:17:21.498 --> 01:17:24.294
Let's, let's get mom
some water. Will you? Please?

01:17:28.057 --> 01:17:29.679
Honey. Honey.

01:17:29.714 --> 01:17:32.440
Here, sit down. Just sit down.

01:17:34.891 --> 01:17:37.445
So, what's uh,
what's going on with you?

01:17:38.205 --> 01:17:39.378
I mean,

01:17:39.413 --> 01:17:40.966
everything's gonna be okay.

01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:43.175
We'll sober up. We always do.

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:45.039
Sort of.

01:17:45.074 --> 01:17:48.284
And you're wrong.
I do know you, honey.

01:17:48.318 --> 01:17:49.734
I still know you.

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:53.358
I'm no one.

01:17:54.324 --> 01:17:56.810
I'm no one to you anymore.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:58.259
You can't even see me.

01:17:59.398 --> 01:18:00.399
Okay.

01:18:01.469 --> 01:18:03.471
Ollie! What the hell is that?

01:18:06.509 --> 01:18:09.892
What? What was that?
What the hell was that?

01:18:09.926 --> 01:18:12.342
We just found him
eating brownies.

01:18:12.377 --> 01:18:13.930
Why the hell would you
give him brownies?

01:18:13.965 --> 01:18:15.207
You know they're not
good for him.

01:18:15.242 --> 01:18:18.072
We didn't! Mom must have, or Joe.

01:18:18.107 --> 01:18:19.384
Where the fuck is Mom?

01:18:19.418 --> 01:18:21.489
She's on the porch.
Clara.

01:18:21.524 --> 01:18:23.906
Clara, you better come in here.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.805
Who did this to you?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.255
Oh, boy.Clara!

01:18:28.289 --> 01:18:30.429
Shit, I'll go get her.

01:18:30.464 --> 01:18:32.846
Oh, boy, you can't die.
It's his birthday.

01:18:33.294 --> 01:18:34.779
Clara.

01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:37.920
Clara, did you...

01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:40.094
Oh, fuck.

01:18:41.855 --> 01:18:43.339
Okay, did she come back in here?

01:18:43.373 --> 01:18:46.066
No. Mom, Ollie is gonna die!

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.551
Riley, here,
put Ollie in the car.

01:18:48.585 --> 01:18:50.518
Julie, come with me,
we're gonna find mom.

01:18:50.553 --> 01:18:51.761
Okay.

01:18:53.452 --> 01:18:54.937
Clara.

01:19:01.391 --> 01:19:02.496
Clara.

01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:10.193
Mom.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:11.954
Clara, come on.

01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:12.989
Where are you?

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:18.236
Mom! This isn't okay!

01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:19.306
Clara.

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:21.549
Clar...

01:19:26.002 --> 01:19:27.176
And she's gone.

01:19:40.258 --> 01:19:41.259
What the hell is that?

01:19:42.432 --> 01:19:44.400
It's a bunny.

01:19:44.434 --> 01:19:48.197
They said
to give it 24 hours.

01:19:48.231 --> 01:19:50.820
I'm scared. She's so trashed.

01:19:50.855 --> 01:19:53.305
I've got a killer hemorrhoid
going on.

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.169
I hope they have
something here for me.

01:19:55.204 --> 01:19:57.827
I'm worried about
where Mom is.

01:19:57.862 --> 01:20:00.071
Why? Because we can't find Mom.

01:20:00.105 --> 01:20:02.798
We can. True, true.

01:20:03.281 --> 01:20:04.282
Okay.

01:20:05.524 --> 01:20:07.457
Where's Clara?

01:20:07.492 --> 01:20:09.287
We don't know right now.

01:20:09.563 --> 01:20:10.564
Um...

01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:15.396
Okay, well, Ollie is very weak.

01:20:15.431 --> 01:20:17.364
We've been pumping his stomach,

01:20:17.398 --> 01:20:19.090
but he's not breathing too well.

01:20:20.574 --> 01:20:22.541
You should call Clara, Ted.

01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:24.992
Hey, Ted.

01:20:25.027 --> 01:20:26.097
Mmm.

01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:28.582
What the... You guys,
he ingested a lot of chocolate

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:29.652
and he already has a bad heart.

01:20:29.686 --> 01:20:31.136
How did this happen?

01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:33.863
Someone left a plate
of brownies on the floor.

01:20:35.037 --> 01:20:36.038
Who did that?

01:20:37.211 --> 01:20:38.247
We don't know.

01:20:42.561 --> 01:20:43.562
Hello?

01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:47.325
Oh, okay, great.

01:20:47.359 --> 01:20:49.396
There's a drunk lady
at the police station.

01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:51.881
Clara.

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:53.952
Um, can I call you a cab?

01:20:53.987 --> 01:20:55.333
Thank you so much.

01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:56.541
Can I have my magazine?

01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:07.310
You can sit right here,
you're ex-wife...

01:21:09.209 --> 01:21:10.451
Right here.

01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:20.634
Fuck you! Fucking morons.

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:23.395
Look, want a show?

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:25.432
Fucking perverted.

01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:31.162
Get out,
fucking the dicks, shits.

01:21:32.404 --> 01:21:35.338
She's lovely, but uh,

01:21:35.373 --> 01:21:36.961
that's not Clara.

01:21:36.995 --> 01:21:38.479
Mom never wears jean shorts.

01:21:38.514 --> 01:21:40.102
It's kinda sad.

01:21:40.136 --> 01:21:43.622
I'd love to see her
in some sexy denim cutoffs.

01:21:43.657 --> 01:21:46.315
Okay, thank you, Julie.

01:22:37.262 --> 01:22:38.608
Mom!

01:22:38.643 --> 01:22:39.713
Clara!

01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:41.542
Mom!

01:22:41.577 --> 01:22:44.269
What are some of Mom's hotspots?

01:22:44.304 --> 01:22:46.685
Oh, come on, honey, you know
we never leave this place.

01:22:47.617 --> 01:22:49.654
Home Depot.What?

01:22:49.688 --> 01:22:52.070
All the men there
have boners for Mom.

01:22:52.105 --> 01:22:54.279
Ugh, please.JULIE: I bet it's true.

01:22:54.314 --> 01:22:55.729
What about the coyotes?

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:12.090
It's Mom's.

01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:14.161
Mom's shirt.

01:23:18.614 --> 01:23:20.271
It's got blood on it.

01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:26.794
Dad, do something.

01:23:29.383 --> 01:23:31.109
Okay, girls.

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:33.525
I want you to go back
to the house now.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.493
We'll pick up Ollie and,

01:23:35.527 --> 01:23:36.839
we'll find Mom.

01:23:36.873 --> 01:23:38.151
We'll figure this out.

01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:41.602
Oh.RILEY: Oh.

01:23:50.128 --> 01:23:52.579
No, we found her bloody shirt.

01:23:52.613 --> 01:23:54.236
Yeah, it's bloody.

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:55.616
And there are coyotes.

01:23:55.651 --> 01:23:57.377
Oh, Mom, Mom!

01:23:59.275 --> 01:24:02.244
It's her phone.
I'm gonna call you back.

01:24:04.867 --> 01:24:06.662
Hello?

01:24:06.696 --> 01:24:10.355
Hi there,
this is Richard Gardner of the Gardner Family Wine company.

01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:13.117
We received your very kind
and thoughtful message,

01:24:13.151 --> 01:24:15.636
uh, Clara and wanted
to reach out directly

01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:18.501
and answer your question about our unique fruity flavor

01:24:18.536 --> 01:24:21.366
but, also just thank you
for calling in.

01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:22.678
It was just really nice.

01:24:23.782 --> 01:24:25.370
You're welcome.

01:24:50.947 --> 01:24:54.675
So, an officer is gonna
meet us by the stone wall.

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:56.263
Still no word from Joe?

01:24:57.195 --> 01:24:58.783
He ruined everything.

01:24:58.817 --> 01:25:01.510
You should not get your weed
from him anymore, Ri.

01:25:53.596 --> 01:25:54.908
Clara.

01:25:56.565 --> 01:25:57.945
Clara.

01:25:59.533 --> 01:26:00.707
It's okay.

01:26:10.648 --> 01:26:12.167
Come here, come on.

01:26:32.601 --> 01:26:34.465
Come on, honey. Come here.

01:28:01.483 --> 01:28:03.381
You know, it was cold out there.

01:28:03.933 --> 01:28:04.934
I bet.

01:28:05.659 --> 01:28:06.660
But it felt good?

01:28:08.075 --> 01:28:10.457
I thought I was gonna have
a panic attack.

01:28:10.492 --> 01:28:11.872
Yeah, I'm hung over already.

01:28:11.907 --> 01:28:13.426
So is Ollie.

01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:18.983
They were in your closet
this whole time.

01:28:19.673 --> 01:28:20.674
I know.

01:28:25.714 --> 01:28:27.612
He's the best of all of us.

01:28:30.857 --> 01:28:34.032
Hey, Mom, you didn't give
Ollie brownies, did you?

01:28:34.067 --> 01:28:35.793
No, of course not.

01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:37.864
It must have
been Poo-poo.

01:28:37.898 --> 01:28:39.417
So fucked up.

01:29:01.094 --> 01:29:04.580
Oh, you get in here, girl.

01:29:04.615 --> 01:29:05.926
Come on, now.

01:29:06.686 --> 01:29:08.377
Park her right in there.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.761
You know, Clara,

01:29:13.727 --> 01:29:16.420
if this was a cry for attention,

01:29:17.835 --> 01:29:19.733
we should have picked
a busier town.

01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:22.046
Old Lyme falls asleep
by 9:00 p.m.

01:29:23.772 --> 01:29:25.463
Good night, family.

01:29:25.498 --> 01:29:26.844
Love you.

01:29:26.878 --> 01:29:28.742
Good night, love you.

01:29:28.777 --> 01:29:29.847
Love you, girls.

01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:31.573
Sleep well.

01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:35.784
I love you.

01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:09.990
Clara.
