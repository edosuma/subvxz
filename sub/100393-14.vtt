WEBVTT

00:11.272 --> 00:13.491
Fantastic.
Where should we meet?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
Excuse me.
I'm looking for room 460.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.973
- You're okay.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.454
Great.
I'll meet you there. Bye.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.672
Dr. Katz...

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
- I don't see anything funny.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.771
Oh, but I do.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.730
You give this white boy
two schooners and an ice rink,

00:34.773 --> 00:36.384
he turns into Tonya Harding.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.168
Hmm.This will take
a couple minutes to fully dry.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.736
This is a soft cast so you can
remove it to shower.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.085
Here's a list
of dos and don'ts.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.739
Make sure your boyfriend
- Not her boyfriend.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.220
He wishes. He took me
to the Holiday Ice Rink,

00:46.263 --> 00:48.004
wore a dress shirt
and spritzed cologne.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.919
What does that tell you?I wouldn't call this
a dress shirt.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.790
Anyway, number two is obvious,

00:51.834 --> 00:53.183
but avoid any weight
on the wrist,

00:53.227 --> 00:54.793
so that means
no figure skating.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.708
I wasn't...
figure skating.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.188
No judgment here,
Scott Hamilton.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.453
I think you could use
a little pick-me-up.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.019
What'd you have in mind?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.413
Your dad's old gambling buddy.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.502
Kurt Flannery? What about him?

01:07.545 --> 01:08.677
I'm meeting with him tomorrow

01:08.720 --> 01:10.113
to discuss your dad's
murder trial.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.159
If I could convince him
to testify

01:12.202 --> 01:14.509
that Vic was framed,
the Attorney General's case

01:14.552 --> 01:16.902
will be dead in the water.Vic's gonna walk?

01:16.946 --> 01:19.775
I think...yeah.
I think he will.

01:25.998 --> 01:29.001
Thank you.  Ooh.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.394
Hi, Lily.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.874
Good morning,
Ms. Carmichael.

01:31.917 --> 01:35.486
- Ahem!
- Ha ha! There's my Lo,

01:35.530 --> 01:37.967
with her face all aglow.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.535
Hey, Carmichael.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.450
Hey, JudgeCarmichael.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
I swear,
that will never get old.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.715
- Hmm.
- Have a seat. Come on.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.151
Got your favorite

01:48.195 --> 01:49.761
glazed doughnut, a coffee,

01:49.805 --> 01:51.459
one creamer, one sugar.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.678
Thank you.
How are you, Daddy?

01:53.722 --> 01:55.202
How was
your work anniversary?

01:55.245 --> 01:56.681
Good, real good.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.509
Oh. I got you
a little somethin'.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.337
Oh!

02:00.381 --> 02:02.122
And you can just open it
when you get home.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.950
25 years
at the legal clinic.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.388
Yeah.
Lawyers took me
to this tasty burger joint

02:07.431 --> 02:10.173
in Echo Park,
gave me a mug that said

02:10.217 --> 02:12.001
"Paralegals are
the real lawyers."

02:12.044 --> 02:14.308
Hmm. Funny, huh?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.353
All right, motor mouth.
Spill it.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.790
- Spill what?
- Rapid, repetitive speech.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.837
You alwaysforget my order,
and you got a little sweat

02:21.880 --> 02:22.881
mixed with maple glaze

02:22.925 --> 02:24.709
...on your upper lip.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.234
You know
"The L.A. Law Chronicle"?

02:27.277 --> 02:29.192
Yeah, the newspaper.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.802
They were blowing up
Sherri's phone

02:30.846 --> 02:33.196
a couple weeks ago to get
a quote for a piece of me.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.851
Judge Lola Carmichael's
trailblazing rise

02:35.894 --> 02:37.505
through the Los Angeles
judicial system.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.550
Yeah, I know.
They called the house, Lo.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.858
What did Mama say?Your mother had
the best intentions,

02:42.901 --> 02:44.903
But you see,
she didn't have her coffee.

02:44.947 --> 02:48.559
Daddy, what did she say?

02:49.604 --> 02:52.955
Hey. I didn't even hear you
leave the house this morning.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.957
I kind of ran out of there.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.046
Are you ready
for the Izzy Ruiz trial?

02:57.089 --> 02:59.353
I'm...ready, yeah.
There's something...

02:59.396 --> 03:00.615
What?

03:00.658 --> 03:02.094
Every time
I've spoken to Izzy,

03:02.138 --> 03:04.836
I've gotten this weird,
this strange feeling, like

03:04.880 --> 03:06.142
Like, what, like
she's lying to you?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.622
Oh, no, no, I know
she's telling me the truth.

03:07.665 --> 03:11.234
It's just something about her
just kind of...bugs me.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.583
You don't like her?

03:12.627 --> 03:15.412
No. It's just, I don't know.
Have you ever gotten

03:15.456 --> 03:17.675
just this weird,
uncomfortable feeling

03:17.719 --> 03:19.547
when you're around someone?

03:19.590 --> 03:21.331
She hasbeen charged
with murder.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.290
Yeah, but that's not it.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.770
You know, I don't
I don't know what it is.Ooh, look at your boo.

03:25.814 --> 03:27.207
He has law clerk interviews
this week

03:27.250 --> 03:28.599
the District Attorney,

03:28.643 --> 03:30.949
the Public Defender,
and a judicial clerkship.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.690
Oh, hey, I heard he applied

03:32.734 --> 03:34.997
to be Judge Benner's clerk
and not Lola's?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.216
I know.I'm gonna start
a courthouse betting pool.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.001
Where will
Deputy Luke Watkins clerk?

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
You wanna place
the first bet?

03:40.524 --> 03:42.265
I am not betting
on my boyf

03:42.309 --> 03:44.093
I mean, no, I don't.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.790
Oh!
There's a new word for you.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.618
I didn't actually say it.
I didn't say

03:47.662 --> 03:48.750
the whole thing, so...Uh-huh, uh-huh, I heard it.
Too late.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.491
- Great.
- Luke!

03:50.534 --> 03:52.319
- Hey, Sara.
- Come on!

03:52.362 --> 03:54.799
Someone's walking with a little
extra pep in their step.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.453
Interview went well?

03:56.497 --> 03:58.977
There's no way I interview for
the Public Defender's office

03:59.021 --> 04:01.763
and their MVP, Ms. Emily Lopez,
didn't get the scoop.

04:01.806 --> 04:05.201
I did, and you kinda kicked
that interview's ass.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.681
Really?
Of course really.
You know you did.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.552
I mean, I was ready
for every question they asked.

04:08.596 --> 04:09.901
I was calm but not aloof.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.207
I was confident
but not arrogant.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.730
That's great.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.602
Hey, you okay?

04:14.645 --> 04:17.344
Yeah, but your interviews
aren't over,

04:17.387 --> 04:19.389
so you know,
keep an open mind.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.738
That's all. Em,

04:21.783 --> 04:23.045
do you not want us working
in the same office?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.569
Have a minute, Ms. Lopez?

04:25.613 --> 04:28.964
I will see you later.
Okay.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.662
Voluntary manslaughter.
12 years.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.447
Izzy Ruiz has a strike prior

04:33.490 --> 04:35.405
for the armed robbery
four years ago.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.277
That doubles her time
on the new charge.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.495
It's a good deal.It's not your best.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.845
The max on a vol in her case
is 27 years.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.717
Be reasonable, Lopez.
- A reasonable jury

04:42.760 --> 04:44.632
could find that my client
acted in self-defense.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.547
I have a witness
who saw her standing

04:46.590 --> 04:49.376
over Vera Calderon's body
in the prison laundry.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.073
And your witness was
Vera's cellmate of two years.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.379
Are you suggesting
she's lying?

04:52.422 --> 04:53.728
I'm suggesting that the jury

04:53.771 --> 04:55.251
will have an opinion
about her credibility.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.818
If Izzy Ruiz
was defending herself,

04:56.861 --> 04:58.602
why were there
no defensive wounds?

04:58.646 --> 05:00.300
But there were bruises
on her forearm

05:00.343 --> 05:01.692
consistent
with strangulation.

05:01.736 --> 05:02.998
Circumstantial.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.652
Should that jury return
a "guilty" verdict,

05:04.695 --> 05:06.436
your client is looking
at life in prison

05:06.480 --> 05:08.133
at 23 years old.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.269
It was self-defense.
I was doing laundry,

05:13.313 --> 05:15.663
and Vera came at me
with a shank head-on.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.752
I got her in a chokehold,
but she wouldn't stop.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.580
- Well, no shank was found.
- There was one,

05:19.623 --> 05:22.147
and my money's on
Vera's cellmate Lee Anne.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.497
She found the body,

05:23.540 --> 05:26.282
and she'd have
a good reason to hide it.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.849
A weapon like that
is gold on the inside.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.764
Okay, all I can base
our case on

05:29.807 --> 05:31.156
is the evidence
in front of us.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.376
The jury won't know
the nature of your prior,

05:33.420 --> 05:35.378
but they will know that you
were incarcerated at the time.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.597
Do you think
I wanted to kill her?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.468
No, Izzy. That's
That's not what I'm

05:38.512 --> 05:40.165
I was three days
from getting out.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.559
After four years,
why would I risk my freedom

05:42.603 --> 05:44.474
unless I had
to protect myself,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.607
but you can't answer that

05:46.650 --> 05:48.696
because you're too busy
seeing the criminal.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.437
That's not true. I'm...

05:50.480 --> 05:54.005
Izzy, my job is to give you
the best defense possible,

05:54.049 --> 05:56.791
and part of that defense is
telling you the raw truth.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.359
Whose truth? Oh, you mean
the one that you cooked up

05:59.402 --> 06:02.274
with another uppity suit while
you're getting your $6 lattes?

06:03.928 --> 06:06.366
You don't like me, do you?

06:06.409 --> 06:09.412
That's okay. I don't like me
much these days, either.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.936
But not enough to spend
another day in prison.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.374
The answer is no.
I want my trial.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.986
Okay.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.423
Mom, you said those words.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.164
Now you need to answer

06:22.207 --> 06:24.601
to the person you said them
aboutyour daughter. Call me.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.776
"Our criminal justice system

06:25.820 --> 06:28.170
"is a perpetual
incarceration machine.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.606
"Black and brown folks
are the mechanisms

06:29.650 --> 06:31.042
"that keep it running.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.783
"My daughter has thrown
a wrench in a machine

06:32.827 --> 06:35.220
that's been failing us
for years."I know. It

06:35.264 --> 06:36.700
"Lola Carmichael is
only a Band-Aid

06:36.744 --> 06:39.094
on Lady Justice's
gushing jugular."

06:39.137 --> 06:41.575
- I am so mortified.
- I am so impressed.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.054
Impressed?

06:43.098 --> 06:45.143
Her prose is equal parts
visceral and vibrant.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.581
Ooh, with a dash of vitriol.
- Her prose is

06:47.624 --> 06:50.235
a character assassination
of the L.A. judicial system.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.846
Then your mother
is Annie Oakley.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.369
Besides,
she's praising you.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.066
Sherri,
it paints me as biased

06:55.110 --> 06:57.199
against the very same system
that I work for.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.201
Oh, you're just
catastrophizing.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.985
That is not even a word.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.031
Irrational, unfounded thoughts
that make a situation worse

07:03.074 --> 07:04.728
than it actually is. Hmm.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.817
I am not being irrational.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.340
Ahem. Remember,
you're taking over

07:08.384 --> 07:09.951
the Izzy Ruiz murder trial
today.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.562
With Judge Este ill,
everyone's slammed.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.912
- I know. Sherri filled me in.
-  Of course.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.959
Lisa, have you read
the piece about me

07:18.002 --> 07:19.917
in the "Law Chronicle"
this morning?
I have.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.615
You should know
I had no idea.

07:21.658 --> 07:22.790
Okay, whatever, Carmichael.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.186
She is furious.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.537
This is not good.
This is bad.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.191
- You don't know that.
- Thanks!

07:33.235 --> 07:36.673
Thank you, Roxy.
You've done it again.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.384
I got all my marbles.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.517
Why evaluate
my mental competence

07:54.561 --> 07:56.519
when I identified
the lousy, thieving

07:56.563 --> 07:57.868
son-of-a-bitch
in a lineup.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.175
Bernadine, I'm just trying toIt's Bernie.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.525
Bernadine sounds like
I should be baking peach pies

08:02.569 --> 08:05.223
for the Red Hat Society
and knitting baby booties.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.096
Well, I don't like baking
or knitting or

08:08.139 --> 08:11.012
- Babies?
- Hats. Wise guy.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.492
Based on
your medical records,

08:12.535 --> 08:13.710
the defense lawyer
has some questions

08:13.754 --> 08:15.973
about your...marbles,

08:16.017 --> 08:18.454
and the judge thought it best
to hold a competency hearing

08:18.498 --> 08:20.543
to determine
your ability to recall.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.979
Who does this judge
think she is?

08:22.023 --> 08:24.765
The judge.
Listen, all you have to do

08:24.808 --> 08:27.942
is testify that you were
visiting your husband's grave

08:27.985 --> 08:30.597
when Joe Collins punched you
and took your purse.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.860
- And my watch.
- Right.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.905
Cripes' sake. Here.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.256
Lift.

08:38.299 --> 08:41.563
How'd you break
those things, anyway?

08:41.607 --> 08:44.436
At the rink.
It was...hockey.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.223
No, it wasn't,
but it's your story.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.704
Without your testimony,
we don't have a case,

08:50.747 --> 08:52.096
so let's just get
through this hearing,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.229
and then we can move forward
with the actual trial.

08:54.272 --> 08:58.973
One condition.
You get my watch back.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.278
Understand?

09:00.322 --> 09:03.020
I'll...try my best.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.501
Once you were brought
into the morgue,

09:05.545 --> 09:06.633
what happened next?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.548
The coroner showed me
the body.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.810
Whose body was it?

09:09.853 --> 09:12.552
My daughter'sVera Calderon.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.684
And what was your reaction to
seeing your daughter like that?

09:14.728 --> 09:17.992
When I saw Vera's body,
I remembered the mornings

09:18.035 --> 09:20.168
I'd go into her room
and watch her sleep.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.213
She looked so peaceful.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.345
When was the last time
you spoke with Vera?

09:23.388 --> 09:24.999
Two days
before she died.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.002
She told me how she had
become a changed woman.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.786
Objection. Hearsay.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.614
Sustained. Everything after
"she died" is stricken.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.138
Mr. Romero,
your next question.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.139
No further questions,
Your Honor.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.668
Ms. Calderon,
you testified earlier

09:41.711 --> 09:43.147
that the last time
you spoke with Vera

09:43.191 --> 09:44.366
was two days before she died.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.672
How long was that call?

09:45.715 --> 09:47.108
A few minutes.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.762
I'd give anything
to get that time back.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.722
Your Honor, I have
a 25-page call log

09:52.766 --> 09:53.636
from
the Department of Corrections

09:53.680 --> 09:55.420
for inmate Vera Calderon.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.857
May I have that
marked as Defense "B"?

09:56.900 --> 09:59.424
So marked.Ms. Calderon, these logs showed

09:59.468 --> 10:01.209
that you and Vera
had phone contact

10:01.252 --> 10:03.298
36 times over the year
prior to her death,

10:03.341 --> 10:06.344
but none of those calls were
longer than 30 seconds.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.260
Does this track?
- Yes.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.001
According to these logs,
the last call was,

10:11.045 --> 10:14.439
as you testified,
two days before Vera's death,

10:14.483 --> 10:16.528
but that call wasn't
a few minutes, was it?

10:16.572 --> 10:19.096
No. It wasn't.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.924
That's right.
It was 18 seconds.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.448
It doesn't sound like you
thought Vera had changed.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.798
- Objection.
- Ms. Lopez.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.451
Withdrawn. Nothing further,
Your Honor.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.425
You look so helpless.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.992
You are just getting
so much pleasure

10:45.035 --> 10:46.558
out of this, aren't you?

10:46.602 --> 10:48.125
Hey, if you would've played
your cards right last night

10:48.169 --> 10:49.779
and stuck to the rails with me,
both of us would have had

10:49.823 --> 10:51.215
a different
post-skate pleasure.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.653
Your prescription.
Thank you.

10:53.696 --> 10:57.004
Kurt Flannery agreed
to testify.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.702
How'd you manage that?My art of persuasion
goes a long way.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.051
- You threatened to subpoena.
- Yeah, that, too.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.488
Now I have
an airtight defense for Vic.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.360
Mr. Callan?
Ask for tomato soup,

11:05.403 --> 11:07.188
and the bastards
gave me potato.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.625
Leave your manners
in your makeup bag, blondie?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.584
I'm sorry.
My name's Amy.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.716
Bernie.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.631
Gotta run.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.334
You haven't knocked boots
with blondie yet,

11:23.378 --> 11:25.641
so can't be trouble
in paradise. What's wrong?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.904
Let's go over the hearing
later today.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.298
To prove that you're competent
to testify at trial,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.082
you need to satisfy
a two-part test.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.389
Oneyou have the capacity
to communicate.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.825
They put too much salt
in this.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.045
Part one, check,
and two, that you have

11:38.088 --> 11:40.003
personal knowledge
of the event.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.439
They put too much salt
in this.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.052
Ready to cut a deal,
Callan?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.097
We haven't met.
I'm Monica Sung,

11:47.141 --> 11:49.012
the other lawyer
in your case.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.666
Then we don't need
to meet.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.364
- No deal, Monica.
- You'll change your mind.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.452
See you in court.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.066
I know, Bernie.
You don't like her.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.372
When you arrived
at the cemetery,

12:01.416 --> 12:02.809
what'd you do, Bernie?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.202
The usual.
I sat in my lawn chair,

12:05.246 --> 12:08.466
cracked upon a tall one,
and visited with my Manuel.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.641
Manuel's
your deceased husband?

12:09.685 --> 12:10.991
Yes.
And what'd you do next?

12:11.034 --> 12:12.775
I was about to take
the first sip of my beer

12:12.819 --> 12:14.342
when the son of a bitch
came

12:14.385 --> 12:16.779
Mrs. Morris, language, please.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.130
The...perp
grabbed me from behind,

12:20.174 --> 12:21.784
covered my mouth.
I fought back

12:21.828 --> 12:23.177
'cause Mother didn't raise
no wimp.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.918
Then he sucker-punched me
and stole my purse

12:24.961 --> 12:26.746
and my watch.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.790
Do you see that man
in this courtroom today?

12:27.834 --> 12:30.010
Yes, he's sitting
right there.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.839
- Identifying the defendant.
- Nothing further.

12:32.882 --> 12:36.277
Mrs. Morris, what did you eat
for lunch this afternoon?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.496
- Objection. Relevance.
- I'm testing the witness'

12:38.540 --> 12:40.498
ability to perceive and recount.
- Overruled.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.239
I'll allow some latitude,
Ms. Sung.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.024
Mrs. Morris,
answer the question.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.725
I didn't eat lunch.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
Mr. Callan,
will the People stipulate

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
Mrs. Morris did eat lunch
with you

12:53.424 --> 12:56.123
less than an hour ago
at the Hit & Run CafÃ©?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.603
Mr. Callan?
Do you stipulate?

12:58.647 --> 13:01.781
Yes. The People stipulate
that Mrs. Morris

13:01.824 --> 13:03.217
did eat lunch today.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.219
You can all kiss my ass!

13:05.262 --> 13:07.395
- Mrs. Morris!
- How would you like it if you

13:07.438 --> 13:09.527
were poked and prodded
like a damn lab rat?

13:09.571 --> 13:13.662
And you, Joe Collins!
You give me back my watch!

13:13.705 --> 13:15.838
- Order in the court!
- Now hold on, ma'am. Stop.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.101
- Ow!
- Don't you hurt him!

13:18.145 --> 13:19.842
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,
sweetheart,

13:19.886 --> 13:22.497
are you all right?

13:22.540 --> 13:23.890
Are you okay, sweetheart?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.895
Mark, call me back.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.635
Spoke to your mother.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.420
She wants to stop by today
and see you.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.770
No. She has my number.
She can use it.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.858
If I may, do you think
you're taking

13:35.902 --> 13:37.294
this article
too personally?

13:37.338 --> 13:39.122
It's the piece about me
with a direct quote

13:39.166 --> 13:41.037
from my mom, so no,
and after my run-in

13:41.081 --> 13:42.473
with the Commission
on Judicial Performance,

13:42.517 --> 13:44.301
I don't need any heat.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.391
I wouldn't label it as heat.
More like harmless attention,

13:47.435 --> 13:49.437
with significant
entertainment value.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.439
Well, you saw Benner
this morning.She'll get over it.

13:51.482 --> 13:54.094
In the meantime, don't...Catastrophize?

13:54.137 --> 13:56.139
I need some air
outside.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.446
People are convinced
Luke's choosing Benner.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.840
- Thanks, Sara.
- Your Honor, I just have to say

14:00.883 --> 14:02.754
your mom is my "shero"!

14:02.798 --> 14:04.626
That quote was awesome.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.367
Luke is choosing who
for what?

14:07.977 --> 14:09.936
Sara?

14:09.979 --> 14:11.763
Luke's interviewing
for clerkships,

14:11.807 --> 14:13.156
including one
with Judge Benner,

14:13.200 --> 14:15.419
so I-I've got a pool going
because pools are fun

14:15.463 --> 14:17.030
and the H.O.J. can use
some fun, right?

14:17.073 --> 14:20.120
Deputy Watkins applied to be
Benner's law clerk, not mine.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
Ucch!

14:37.964 --> 14:39.443
Look, if this is
about another plea

14:39.487 --> 14:41.663
It's not. I wanted to

14:41.706 --> 14:44.753
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.320
How are you doing?

14:49.453 --> 14:54.197
I want to...
share something with you.

14:54.241 --> 14:57.592
My parents left Puerto Rico
when they were newlyweds.

14:57.635 --> 15:01.030
They settled in Downey,
started a trucking company.

15:01.074 --> 15:04.033
And it was really good
for a while.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.428
But then they
they lost everything,

15:07.471 --> 15:09.952
and it got really bad.

15:09.996 --> 15:13.042
I was 16.
I was partying, and...

15:13.086 --> 15:15.740
and other stuff, stealing.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.178
II got arrested.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.657
My parents were already
struggling,

15:19.701 --> 15:21.311
and I was just
making it worse.

15:21.355 --> 15:26.795
I was on my way to juvie,
and I was just so mad

15:26.838 --> 15:28.492
at, like, everyone.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.059
It got to the point
where we

15:30.103 --> 15:31.669
we didn't speak
for, like, a year.

15:31.713 --> 15:35.325
So, Izzy, I know
what it's like

15:35.369 --> 15:36.674
Are you for real
right now?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.502
I'm just trying

15:38.546 --> 15:40.504
Trying to what?
Relate to me?

15:40.548 --> 15:43.986
Like how? A short stint
in juvie is a joke

15:44.030 --> 15:45.814
compared to four years
in maximum.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.120
And you think you know me
'cause what,

15:47.163 --> 15:49.296
we're both brown women
in the system?

15:49.339 --> 15:50.645
'Cause your parents
were pissed at you?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.429
I'm talking to you
through glass.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.911
Yeah, I'm not tryingYou don't know
the first thing about me

15:55.955 --> 15:57.521
or about life on the inside,

15:57.565 --> 15:59.436
so stick
to what you do know

15:59.480 --> 16:00.960
defending criminals
like me.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.314
Go back to my cell,
please.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.105
Thank you for the opportunity,
Judge Benner.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.107
You'll be hearing
from my J.A. soon.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.503
Sherri, I didn't hear you.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.809
I have
an astoundingly light tread.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.376
Judge Carmichael
would like a word

16:26.420 --> 16:27.812
after court adjourns
today.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.162
Thank you.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.602
I trusted you,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
and you let them humiliate me
in that courtroom.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.954
After what happened
in that courtr

16:38.998 --> 16:41.043
After what happened
in that courtroom,

16:41.087 --> 16:42.784
the defense lawyer offered

16:42.827 --> 16:44.046
to plea out your case
to a misdemeanor.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.613
If I agreed, Joe Collins

16:45.656 --> 16:47.180
would have gotten away
scot-free.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.529
I didn't because I believed
your story the first time,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.357
and I still do.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.619
And I'm trying to get back
your watch.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.969
Mark!You want in

16:54.013 --> 16:57.059
on the "Where will Luke clerk
in the courthouse" pool?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.713
Oh, my God. What happened?

16:58.756 --> 17:00.062
Chatty Cathy, can't you see

17:00.106 --> 17:04.066
we're having
a damn Hallmark moment here?

17:04.109 --> 17:06.286
- That wasn't nice, Bernie.
- Yeah, well, it's in the past.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.852
It literally just happened.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.637
I'm trying to tell you
something.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.858
That watch was
World War II-era Elgin

17:13.902 --> 17:15.817
that he got
from a pawn shop.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.906
The band was worn.
The case was scratched.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.040
The crown was stuck.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.740
But you see,
I love history.

17:25.782 --> 17:28.612
So Manny bought me
historical gifts.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.484
What year
was Elgin founded?

17:30.527 --> 17:33.269
1864.
Changed its name in 1874.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.664
Manuel set the watch
to Eastern time,

17:36.707 --> 17:40.320
promising that we'd be
in Niagara Falls for our 60th.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.714
We'd always wanted to go.

17:43.758 --> 17:50.460
But he died, and...
time ultimately won.

17:50.504 --> 17:55.770
Bernie, I need to re-establish
your competence on that stand.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.077
I have an idea
how I'm gonna do that.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.559
- What kind of watch was it?
- Objection. Relevance.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.821
If we travel down
this distorted memory lane,

18:03.865 --> 18:04.779
we'll be here all night.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.911
Overruled.
Witness may respond.

18:06.955 --> 18:11.177
It was an Elgin,
32-millimeter metal case.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.658
Stainless steel case back.
Rusted white dial.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.443
NATO strap was swapped out
for leather.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.053
What is Elgin?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.969
Oh, it was an Illinois-based
watch company founded in 1864.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.319
Before Elgin, all watches
were handmade.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.713
They changed the industry

18:25.756 --> 18:28.672
by mass producing watches
with machine-made parts.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.935
Men branded them
the working man's watch,

18:30.979 --> 18:34.504
as if women didn't work.
Sexist bastards.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.158
- Mrs. Morris.
- Oh, sorry, Judge.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.726
What was the watch company's
logo, Mrs. Morris?

18:38.769 --> 18:41.468
It was the Greek god Chronos
with a scythe in one hand

18:41.511 --> 18:42.860
and a pocket watch
in the other.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.993
You know, that watch isn't
worth a wooden nickel,

18:45.036 --> 18:48.649
and, like all of the other
presents Manuel gave me,

18:48.692 --> 18:51.173
I...disregarded it.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.958
But if he were here now,
I would tell him...

18:55.743 --> 18:58.441
that watch
means the world to me.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.141
Your Honor,
Mrs. Morris may be confused

19:02.184 --> 19:03.925
about recent
short-term events,

19:03.968 --> 19:06.580
but her long-term memory
is steel-trap.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.322
The defendant robbed her of one
of those priceless memories

19:09.365 --> 19:11.193
one year ago,
which any reasonable person

19:11.237 --> 19:13.413
would qualify as long term,
Given the foregoing,

19:13.456 --> 19:17.330
the People respectfully urge
the court to allow Mrs. Morris

19:17.373 --> 19:22.987
to tell her story at trial
in her own words.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.076
Nothing further. Thank you.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.821
I'll render my decision soon.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.436
Lee Ann, are you an inmate

19:36.479 --> 19:38.351
at the Central California
Women's Facility?

19:38.394 --> 19:39.526
Yeah, I am.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.744
Did you know the victim
Vera Calderon?

19:40.788 --> 19:42.093
We're...

19:42.137 --> 19:44.835
We werecellmates
for two years.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.359
And what was
your relationship like?

19:46.402 --> 19:48.143
Close. Best friends.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.276
Can you tell us what you saw
on the night in question?

19:52.321 --> 19:54.018
Vera didn't show up
at the mess hall for dinner,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.672
and we never miss a meal
together,

19:55.716 --> 19:58.849
so I looked for her,
and that's when I found her

19:58.893 --> 20:00.155
in the prison laundry room.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.201
And what did you find?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.768
Izzy was standing over
Vera's body.

20:04.812 --> 20:08.337
She saw me. She ran off.
I went to see if Vera's okay,

20:08.381 --> 20:12.428
but she wasn't breathing.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.169
You killed her.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.736
- Objection.
- Ms. Moss.

20:15.779 --> 20:16.954
You killed Vera!
You killed her!Calm down. Relax.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.956
- Hey, sit down.
- Order!

20:19.000 --> 20:20.915
Calm down. Sit down.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.090
Sit down.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.487
I think that's enough
for today.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.359
Jurors and all parties
are ordered to return tomorrow

20:30.403 --> 20:32.970
at 10:30 a.m.
Court is adjourned.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.451
I thought you said
you were gon' be cool.

20:35.495 --> 20:36.974
Step out of the box.
Hands behind your back.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.368
Okay.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.066
I got it.

20:52.468 --> 20:55.776
Izzy, tell me about
that shank again.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.299
Okay, the shank
that you described

20:57.343 --> 21:00.346
When you look at me, do you
do you see a murderer?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.787
What you said before,
me not liking you, it's not

21:06.830 --> 21:08.005
Doesn't matter.
You don't need

21:08.049 --> 21:09.529
Let me finish. Okay?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.620
At the pre-trial hearing,

21:13.663 --> 21:15.317
I noticed that you didn't
have any family

21:15.361 --> 21:16.840
sitting in the gallery,

21:16.884 --> 21:18.364
and same with this trial.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.149
What I was trying to say
before...

21:23.151 --> 21:26.720
I remember being a kid
in custody,

21:26.763 --> 21:30.767
sitting in the courtroom,
feeling really alone.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.683
And when I saw you,
I think I'm reminded

21:33.727 --> 21:37.339
of the loneliness
and the shame that...

21:37.383 --> 21:39.123
that I felt when I was 16.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.430
And now?

21:41.474 --> 21:43.476
What do you see?

21:43.519 --> 21:46.479
I see a young woman
who deserves a second chance.

21:51.527 --> 21:55.139
Okay. So...tell me
about this shank.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.838
Um...

21:57.881 --> 22:00.580
Mr. Watkins, you have been
on the front line of 802.

22:00.623 --> 22:01.972
And the experience
has been

22:02.016 --> 22:03.931
You have seen every move
I've made on the bench

22:03.974 --> 22:05.498
since I first
put on the robe.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.108
We've established a rapport,
right?

22:07.151 --> 22:08.588
Yes, Your Honor.

22:08.631 --> 22:09.980
Then why not apply
to be my clerk?

22:10.024 --> 22:11.765
I promise you
It's not personal.

22:11.808 --> 22:12.853
If one more person
says that today,

22:12.896 --> 22:14.507
it ispersonal.

22:14.550 --> 22:15.812
If you think my decision
has anything to do

22:15.856 --> 22:17.423
with that article,
I promise you,

22:17.466 --> 22:19.250
it absolutely does not.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.299
Mom.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.562
Lo. Let's talk.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.704
Mm.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.140
Hey, Dorothy Hamill.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.534
The Attorney General
folded.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.318
They're dropping
the charges against Vic.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.146
What?

22:45.189 --> 22:48.976
Your dad's gonna be released,
Mark. It's over.

22:49.019 --> 22:52.196
You okay?
You want to sit down?

22:52.240 --> 22:56.636
No. No. I...

22:56.679 --> 22:58.942
Thank you.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.814
Going to Twin Towers later
to give Vic the news,

23:00.857 --> 23:02.816
make sure the paperwork
is straight.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.253
Come with me.
I need to...

23:05.296 --> 23:07.342
I need to find
Bernie's watch.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.649
I'll meet you there.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.871
Calm down, daughter.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.091
The reporter sought meout.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.441
It wasn't
the other way around.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.836
Don't deflect, Mom. You know
this is about whatyou said.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.229
"Lola Carmichael
is a Band-Aid

23:25.273 --> 23:27.754
on Lady Justice's
gushing jugular."

23:27.797 --> 23:31.279
If growing up in a household
with me taught you anything,

23:31.322 --> 23:33.324
it's to stand firm
in what you believe.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.240
I stand by what I said.

23:36.284 --> 23:37.416
Even at the cost
of hurting your own child.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.288
You know that that was
not my intention.

23:40.331 --> 23:43.422
I believe you. I do.
But you were reckless.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.511
The reporter asked
for a statement about me.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.860
You turned this
into an indictment

23:46.903 --> 23:48.427
of the L.A. judicial system.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.734
Exactly. A system
that continues to recycle

23:51.778 --> 23:54.171
the same people of color

23:54.215 --> 23:56.522
people like you and me.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.133
Mom! I am talking
about optics,

23:59.176 --> 24:02.005
and you of all people
know about optics.

24:02.049 --> 24:05.444
And you knew better than to make
a public statement like that.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.882
Why would I not say it
in public

24:08.925 --> 24:11.493
if that is what I believe?

24:11.537 --> 24:14.975
The public has always been
my domain!

24:15.018 --> 24:16.803
And very clearly,

24:16.846 --> 24:18.935
this institution
has become yours.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.111
Yes, it has!

24:21.155 --> 24:23.940
But not in the way
that you think, Mom.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.813
With that robe,
I have the power

24:26.856 --> 24:29.859
to protect the people who are
being abused by the law

24:29.903 --> 24:32.209
and from the law
from being abused.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.602
Why can't you see that?

24:33.646 --> 24:38.085
The last time I came here,
you reminded me

24:38.128 --> 24:42.089
that my little girl
became a judge.

24:42.132 --> 24:45.832
I know who I raised then,
and I know who you are now.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.007
But you can't reconcile
the two.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.183
I didn't say that.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.708
Mom, you made me
that fire, that passion

24:52.752 --> 24:54.710
to change the world
one person at a time

24:54.754 --> 24:56.320
you gave me that.

24:56.364 --> 24:59.585
We are not in opposition.

24:59.628 --> 25:02.326
We are on the same side.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.503
You just have to accept
the fact

25:04.546 --> 25:06.548
that my tactics
are different than yours.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.984
Maybe they shouldn't be.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.856
Maybe you should be
out there with the people

25:09.899 --> 25:13.076
instead of looking down
at them.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.172
Wow.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.655
You just went there.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.528
- Lo.
- Mama, I got work to do.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.383
- Ohh!
- Bernie, it's me.

25:59.427 --> 26:02.430
Oh. What the hell's
the matter with you,

26:02.473 --> 26:05.041
sneaking up on an 80-year-old
victim of robbery?

26:05.085 --> 26:06.695
I'm sorry. I came to tell you

26:06.739 --> 26:09.350
the judge is gonna let you
testify at trial.

26:09.393 --> 26:12.745
You did good, Bernie.
Your husband would be proud.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.094
Want a beer?

26:14.137 --> 26:16.531
Ah, I'm good, but thanks.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.228
Take my word for it.
You need a drink.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.278
Manny loved fishing.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.585
Never had the skill
or the luck for it,

26:26.628 --> 26:28.021
but he would sit there
for hours.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.110
Me, I'm too impatient.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.025
So if you think
I'm gonna...

26:32.068 --> 26:33.766
fish for what's wrong
with you...

26:36.899 --> 26:41.121
My dad and I,
wewe don't, um...

26:41.164 --> 26:43.602
Anyway, he got himself
into some trouble,

26:43.645 --> 26:47.780
and I helped him get out
of it because, well...

26:47.823 --> 26:52.132
right now we're right back
to where we started,

26:52.175 --> 26:56.440
I guess I just thought
it would be different.

26:56.484 --> 27:01.054
It's strange.
It's the most time

27:01.097 --> 27:02.795
we've spent together
in years.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.493
That's not strange.
It's life.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.366
I mean, losing time
is the worst thing

27:09.410 --> 27:10.846
we can do to ourselves.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.807
Seems like you've lost
a lot of time.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.202
Let it go.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.378
You'll be just fine
without the pain.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.694
The Attorney General
has agreed

27:32.738 --> 27:34.174
to drop the charges.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.871
So when do I get
out of here?

27:35.915 --> 27:38.178
- You waste no time, do you?
- Hey, take a look around.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.223
Excuse me for cutting
to the chase, Mark.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.965
- Not even a "thank you"?
- Stop it. We won.

27:43.009 --> 27:46.795
Iwon. Vic, once the court
processes your paperwork,

27:46.839 --> 27:49.189
the sheriff will make sure
there are no other holds on you.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
There won't be.
Then you'll be released.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.716
Then my job is done.
Questions?

27:54.760 --> 27:58.198
I didn't think so.
I'll be outside.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.382
Where to after this?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.863
The Armenians aren't
through with me.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.865
Anywhere I go in L.A.,

28:12.908 --> 28:14.214
it's gonna be a hit
on my head,

28:14.257 --> 28:18.697
so I think it's time
for aa little vacation.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.483
You need a ride
out of town?

28:22.526 --> 28:26.008
No, I'll find my way.
Always do.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.491
So...

28:35.801 --> 28:38.281
I'll see you when I see ya.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.327
Yeah. I'll...

28:41.807 --> 28:42.721
Yeah.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.726
Let me know where you land.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.641
Door, please.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.609
Oh! What happened?

29:01.652 --> 29:03.306
- Me and Amy were at the
- Did you two...

29:03.350 --> 29:05.874
No. No. We were working
late last night

29:05.918 --> 29:07.789
and ended up
at the Holiday Ice Rink

29:07.833 --> 29:09.878
at Pershing Square,
and where's

29:09.922 --> 29:11.314
The hooch?

29:11.358 --> 29:13.490
I had a few beers,
started showing off.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.754
Next thing you know,
voilÃ two broken wrists.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.060
The ice rink.
You really like her.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.802
So you're working late.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.499
Does she have any updates
on Vic's case?

29:22.543 --> 29:24.153
Actually, yes.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.938
Amy's getting the charges
against Vic dropped.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.070
What? Mark, oh, my God.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.246
That's my 24 hours
in a nutshell.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.075
- And?
- And the truth hasn't changed.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.990
I can always rely
on Vic to be Vic.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.644
I can never rely on him
to be a father.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.472
My whole life, I've been
waiting for that to change,

29:38.515 --> 29:39.952
and itit won't.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.128
You don't know that.
You don't.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.825
Talk to Roxy?

29:43.869 --> 29:46.262
Actually, yes.
She stopped by

29:46.306 --> 29:48.917
to stand her ground
and not apologize.

29:48.961 --> 29:49.962
She could have done that
in a text.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.833
She didn't mean
to hurt you, Lola.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.313
I know she didn't mean
to hurt me, Mark,

29:53.356 --> 29:55.837
but she did, and now I'm left
dealing with the heat.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.492
What heat?I just dodged a bullet
with the C.J.P. hearings,

29:58.535 --> 30:00.189
and now I am back to having
judges and lawyers

30:00.233 --> 30:01.669
thinking that I am

30:01.712 --> 30:03.671
Oh, come on, Lola.
Nobody's thinking anything

30:03.714 --> 30:05.847
except that you have
a very passionate

30:05.891 --> 30:07.544
and vocal mom
who's trying to

30:07.588 --> 30:08.850
I need to stay
out of the spotlight,

30:08.894 --> 30:11.113
and her words just put me
right back in it.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.854
- In a good way.
- Why are you diminishing this?

30:12.898 --> 30:14.073
I'm not diminishing
anything.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.552
You're blowing it up.Yes, you are!

30:15.596 --> 30:17.032
You're always trying
to sabotage your relationship

30:17.076 --> 30:18.860
with your mom.I don't always do that, Mark.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.514
Yes, you do. Look at you.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.863
You know what?

30:23.212 --> 30:24.474
I need to be alone.

30:24.518 --> 30:25.562
Okay.

30:25.606 --> 30:28.304
Wow. Okay.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.272
Ms. Lopez, your witness.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.406
Ms. Moss, how would you
describe the relationship

30:43.450 --> 30:45.147
between Vera and Izzy?

30:45.191 --> 30:46.583
They didn't like
each other.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.368
In the days leading up
to Izzy's release,

30:48.411 --> 30:50.370
Izzy bragged about getting out,
didn't she?

30:50.413 --> 30:53.416
Yeah. Rubbed it
in all our faces.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.897
Did Vera seem like she was
angry at Izzy for bragging?

30:55.941 --> 30:57.943
Objection.
Hearsay and speculation.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.032
I am asking the witness
to testify as to her perception

31:00.075 --> 31:02.164
given her close relationship
to the alleged victim.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.123
Overruled.
Witness may answer.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.866
I guess you could say
Vera was angry.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.956
That's a...lovely necklace
you're wearing.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.740
Where did you get it?

31:14.785 --> 31:16.831
Please answer
Ms. Lopez' question.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.660
I, uh, I made it.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.618
You work in the prison
woodshop, don't you?

31:23.969 --> 31:25.405
Will the court please
direct the witness

31:25.448 --> 31:26.667
to answer the question?

31:26.710 --> 31:28.277
What she's saying ain't got
nothing to do

31:28.321 --> 31:30.105
with Vera being deadnothing!
- Please sit down.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.543
Sit down.

31:33.587 --> 31:35.981
Ms. Moss, we are all here
to get to the truth.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.504
I believe you want that,
too.

31:37.547 --> 31:40.594
So please,
answer Ms. Lopez' question.

31:43.379 --> 31:48.210
Yeah. I work
at the prison woodshop.

31:48.254 --> 31:51.300
I use the scraps to make
jewelry that I sell online.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.433
You used these scraps
to help make a shank for Vera.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.000
- Objection!
- Ms. Lopez.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.132
Argumentative and assumes
facts not in evidence.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.004
Your Honor, I am merely askingYour Honor,
the defense is merely

31:59.047 --> 32:01.006
bullying the People's witness.
- That's enough.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.095
Your Honor,
no shank was recovered.That's 'cause I got it!

32:10.015 --> 32:13.061
I loved Vera.
And she loved me.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.934
We loved each other,
but she was

32:15.977 --> 32:17.413
she was depressed,

32:17.457 --> 32:19.589
and in prison,
no one cares about that stuff.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.635
Being depressed just means
thatthat you're weak

32:21.678 --> 32:24.768
or you're going psych, so Vera
kept real quiet about that.

32:24.812 --> 32:28.424
But when Izzy bragged
about getting out,

32:28.468 --> 32:30.557
Vera said she wanted
to hurt her,

32:30.600 --> 32:33.299
and I didn't think
that was real talk.

32:33.342 --> 32:36.084
And that would always be
my fault.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.349
But, uh...

32:41.960 --> 32:43.744
Vera knew I had a shank,

32:43.787 --> 32:45.964
and that night,
when I found her,

32:46.007 --> 32:48.444
the shank was
right next to her.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.143
And I stashed it

32:51.186 --> 32:53.928
to protect her...and me.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.801
I'm sorry.

33:16.864 --> 33:19.998
It's an Elgin, stainless steel,
rusted white dial,

33:20.041 --> 33:21.912
worn leather band.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.262
The watch is crucial
to my case,

33:23.305 --> 33:25.873
so please. Thanks.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.528
Wow, that old buzzard really
grew on you, didn't she?

33:28.571 --> 33:30.443
As a matter of fact,
she did.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.314
What can I do for you,
Monica?

33:32.358 --> 33:33.968
My client's willing to plead
guilty to the robbery charge,

33:34.012 --> 33:35.578
mid-term, three years.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.798
But not without a caveat?
Let me guess.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.104
Drop the GBI enhancement?

33:39.147 --> 33:42.194
And Joe Collins
returns Bernie's things...

33:42.237 --> 33:43.847
including the watch.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.339
Oh. Hi. Is
Is Bernie home?

33:57.383 --> 33:59.167
My name's Mark Callan.
I'm a prosecutor.

33:59.211 --> 34:03.519
I was trying Bernie's
I'm sorry. Is she here?

34:03.563 --> 34:05.739
I wanted to return
something to her.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.610
Bernardine died
last night.

34:08.655 --> 34:13.007
What? I...I...
just saw her.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.226
She was 80.

34:14.268 --> 34:16.445
Her diet consisted
pretty much of cheap beer

34:16.489 --> 34:17.489
and TV dinners.

34:19.447 --> 34:20.841
I'm sorry. Who are you?

34:20.884 --> 34:24.105
I'm her son Daniel.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.726
Can I get you anything,
Izzy?

34:36.770 --> 34:39.728
No.
Thank you, though.

34:44.386 --> 34:48.434
You know, in prison,
time moves so slow...

34:48.476 --> 34:50.565
almost like it stops.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.134
A week feels like a year.

34:53.178 --> 34:57.443
After a while, you forget
that on the outside,

34:57.486 --> 34:59.009
time moves
at lightning speed.

34:59.053 --> 35:04.145
People you love get on
with their lives without you.

35:04.189 --> 35:08.018
Every inmate feels alone.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.020
Knowing how depressed
Vera was

35:10.064 --> 35:11.500
Her pain was beyond
your control.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.112
I killed her.
Vera's dead because

35:14.155 --> 35:16.549
You had to defend yourself.

35:20.248 --> 35:24.209
Can't imagine the guilt
Vera's mom feels.

35:24.252 --> 35:27.081
You know, all the times
that she could have wrote

35:27.125 --> 35:29.562
or called her, and she'll
never get that back

35:29.605 --> 35:31.781
because of me.You are not a bad person.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.139
Verdict.
I'm gonna get a bailiff.

35:43.445 --> 35:46.492
"People of California
vs. Isabella Ruiz

35:46.535 --> 35:48.798
"as to the charge in Count 1
murder, in violation

35:48.842 --> 35:51.192
"of Penal Code section 187-A,

35:51.236 --> 35:53.107
"we the jury
in the above entitled case

35:53.151 --> 35:55.805
find the defendant
not guilty."

36:01.768 --> 36:04.118
Members of the jury,
we thank you for your diligence

36:04.162 --> 36:05.946
and your time.

36:05.989 --> 36:09.558
Ms. Ruiz?
You are free to go.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.519
Mr. Watkins.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.745
Good luck with the rest
of your interviews.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.617
Wherever you land,
they'll be the lucky ones.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.749
Actually, I accepted a clerkship
at the D.A.'s office.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.882
My old stomping grounds?

36:28.925 --> 36:30.231
That's what I was trying
to explain to you before.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.626
The truth is, Your Honor,

36:33.669 --> 36:35.062
I don't want to clerk
for you.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.542
I want to beyou.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.239
So I'm gonna start
where you started.

36:51.383 --> 36:54.951
Judge Carmichael found
an amazing program for you.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.779
You get to live there
for free.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.433
They're gonna help you
find a job, okay?

36:58.477 --> 36:59.826
Things are happening
in a really good way.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.915
All right?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.401
It's okay. It's okay.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.054
Celebration is in order.

37:11.098 --> 37:14.319
You restored
that woman's freedom

37:14.362 --> 37:18.018
and mine being taken away
with this D.A. clerkship.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.541
You're going
to the D.A.'s office?

37:19.585 --> 37:21.978
- Looks like it.
- Whoop!

37:22.022 --> 37:26.287
That's amazing.
That's so great.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.682
Before we...pop open
the bubbly,

37:29.725 --> 37:30.987
I need to tell you
something.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.902
Our lives are gonna
get more complicated

37:32.946 --> 37:34.904
as you get closer
to becoming a lawyer,

37:34.948 --> 37:39.257
and I worry because
I really care for you.

37:39.300 --> 37:43.957
The truth is...
I've been worried, too.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.828
- Oh.
- Today it's a clerkship.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.091
Tomorrow
it'll be something else.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.832
We'll figure it out.
Mm-hmm.

37:49.876 --> 37:50.920
Mm-hmm?

37:50.964 --> 37:53.793
Mm-hmm.

37:56.883 --> 37:59.364
Luke chose the D.A.
Who knew?

37:59.407 --> 38:00.800
Me.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.281
You? You didn't place
any bet.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.674
Oh, but I did. I had a clerk
do it for me under an alias.

38:05.718 --> 38:08.634
Wait. You're...
Hemorrhoid...Gran

38:08.677 --> 38:10.200
Hermione Granger.
"Harry Potter"?

38:10.244 --> 38:12.420
Never mind.
Pay up, bookie.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.640
Minus a vig.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.337
That's a big vig.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.643
Well...

38:23.170 --> 38:26.216
You know, for years,
I've been watching my wife

38:26.260 --> 38:28.567
out in the street,
fighting the good fight.

38:28.610 --> 38:32.222
Now I get to watch
my daughter in here

38:32.266 --> 38:36.139
fight the same good fight.
Ah.

38:36.183 --> 38:38.533
I am so proud of you, Lola.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.406
Okay, Daddy, spill it.

38:41.449 --> 38:45.018
Mom was supposed to tell you
this herself,

38:45.061 --> 38:47.237
But she said those things
in the paper because

38:47.281 --> 38:48.804
Because her cause
always needs a platform?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.197
Because she was
reaching out to you, Lo,

38:50.240 --> 38:52.373
trying to get your attention.Well, it worked.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.375
She's taking
a leave of absence

38:54.419 --> 38:55.942
from the nonprofit.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.379
It's been hard.
She needs a break.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.512
- Since when?
- Since two months ago.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.514
I think she's finally
hit a wall

39:02.557 --> 39:05.604
and is feeling lost.

39:05.647 --> 39:08.650
I can't even imagine her
at home, sitting.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.478
She's always out, doing.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.438
Maybe I was
catastrophizing.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.396
- Catastro-what?
- Nothing, Daddy.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.442
People can change, Lo.

39:17.485 --> 39:21.402
In the meantime,
let's have dinner tonight.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.449
We both miss you. Okay?

39:26.538 --> 39:27.626
Tonight. Okay?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.018
Okay, Daddy.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.849
Come in.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.767
Okay, I can't apologize

39:38.811 --> 39:40.029
for my mother's actions,
nor should I have to.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.641
Your mother's what?
Oh, that article?

39:42.684 --> 39:44.338
I don't care about that.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.992
You couldn't have said that
two days ago?

39:46.035 --> 39:46.949
Sorry. I haven't been
myself lately.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.299
I've been
brief and brusque.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.345
- That's two "B" words.
- Don't push it, Carmichael.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.565
I have had to keep this
under wraps,

39:53.608 --> 39:56.350
but I wanted you to be
the first to know.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.178
I'm running for
State Attorney General.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.540
I appreciate the lift.
Glad you called.

40:12.584 --> 40:16.239
No worries. I didn't want
to leave things...

40:16.283 --> 40:18.851
the way we did, so...

40:23.246 --> 40:25.988
Remember
when you were a kid

40:26.032 --> 40:28.077
and we would go
to the movies

40:28.121 --> 40:32.212
and I would buy us each
a ticket?

40:32.255 --> 40:34.736
And then...we'd go in
and we'd stay

40:34.780 --> 40:37.217
for two or three flicks?

40:37.260 --> 40:39.088
- Three-for-one special.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.395
Yeah, and you were always
so afraid

40:41.439 --> 40:42.918
we were gonna get caught.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.357
But I always told you,

40:47.401 --> 40:51.405
"You're gonna be safe
as long as you're with me."

40:53.538 --> 40:55.496
And you believed me.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.801
Already ordered us
spring rolls.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.542
Mm.
So happy you came.

41:41.586 --> 41:42.761
Is Mark joining us?

41:42.804 --> 41:44.327
I'm not sure. I texted him.

41:44.371 --> 41:46.460
Where is, uh...

41:48.810 --> 41:53.467
Now you know my favorite show
is Ro and Lo going toe to toe.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.688
But tonight let's just eat.

41:56.731 --> 41:57.993
- Fine by me.
- I'm okay with that.

42:09.222 --> 42:10.571
Jazz!

42:10.615 --> 42:13.922
- Hey, Jazz!
- Hi. How are you?

42:13.966 --> 42:16.664
- Carmichael family.

42:16.708 --> 42:19.145
- What do you have tonight?
- Three flavor fish

42:19.188 --> 42:21.539
with sweet and sour
and soul food.

42:23.105 --> 42:24.759
All right, Jazz,
thank you for that.

42:32.419 --> 42:33.681
How are your wrists?
