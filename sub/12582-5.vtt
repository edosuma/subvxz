00:33.181 --> 00:35.311
<i>...y ahora, regressamos al
Monsignor Martinez.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:37.682
<i>Rescate</i>.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.984
<i>Yhora,
ustedes se pueden besar.</i>

00:53.203 --> 00:55.763
<i>Vaya con Dios</i>.

01:13.556 --> 01:15.421
Even in a wedding dress

01:15.458 --> 01:18.256
Monsignor Martinez looks hot.

01:18.294 --> 01:21.092
Hmm, that is one sexy priest.

01:21.131 --> 01:23.361
<i>Este sabado, Eduardo Felipe</i>

01:23.399 --> 01:26.766
<i>su mismo va a aparecer persona
en Arlen, Texas.</i>

01:26.803 --> 01:28.031
Oh, my God.

01:28.071 --> 01:30.539
The actor who plays
Monsignor Martinez...

01:30.573 --> 01:32.803
Eduardo Filipe... is
coming to Arlen.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.104
We have to go, sugs.

01:34.144 --> 01:36.408
I bet he's even
swarthier in person.

01:36.446 --> 01:38.846
I have been using videotapes
of the show

01:38.882 --> 01:41.248
as a teaching tool
in my Spanish class.

01:41.284 --> 01:43.548
I bet I could get the actor
to show up

01:43.586 --> 01:45.019
and be a guest speaker.

01:45.054 --> 01:47.852
I would to see the full-time
teacher Mrs. Pratt,

01:47.891 --> 01:49.586
try to follow me after that.

01:49.626 --> 01:53.027
I am very excited to be in...

01:53.062 --> 01:56.156
Ar... len, to promote
the new episodes

01:56.199 --> 01:57.860
of my show.

01:57.901 --> 01:59.596
This will be our 11th season.

01:59.636 --> 02:02.400
I can't believe
it's really him.

02:03.807 --> 02:06.537
Hey, could you say,
<i>"Vay con Dios"</i> for me?

02:06.576 --> 02:08.066
Next.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.874
<i>Hola,</i> my name is Peggy Hill,

02:09.913 --> 02:11.744
and I am the
three-time winner

02:11.781 --> 02:13.646
of the substitute
teacher award

02:13.683 --> 02:15.480
at Tom Landry Middle School.

02:15.518 --> 02:18.043
Well, maybe I should be asking
for your autograph.

02:18.087 --> 02:19.315
Oh, no.

02:19.355 --> 02:21.915
Seρor Filipe, my students and I
love your show.

02:21.958 --> 02:25.121
And I was wondering if you could
come to my Spanish class

02:25.161 --> 02:26.321
as a special guest.

02:26.362 --> 02:28.421
I'm sorry, Seρora,
but I have a rule

02:28.464 --> 02:30.159
about special appearances...

02:30.200 --> 02:33.761
I do them only for my charity
work with the sick children,

02:33.803 --> 02:36.397
or for paid vacations
on the cruise ships.

02:37.841 --> 02:41.242
Dad, I accidentally
used your toothbrush again.

02:41.277 --> 02:42.574
Throw it out.

02:42.612 --> 02:45.445
I got freakin'
Monsignor Martinez

02:45.481 --> 02:47.779
and he is coming
to my classroom tomorrow.

02:47.817 --> 02:48.784
Really? Wow.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.945
Mom, can I come meet him?

02:50.987 --> 02:52.215
You bet you can.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.280
But you have to pretend
to be a sick child.

02:54.324 --> 02:55.621
Hmm.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.751
What? The man only does guest
appearances for sick children.

02:59.796 --> 03:00.990
So what?

03:01.030 --> 03:04.431
Peggy, the boy ain't right,
but he's not sick.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.196
Can I be in a bubble?

03:06.236 --> 03:08.966
<i>Who is excited about
watching this week's</i>

03:09.005 --> 03:12.532
episode of <i>Monsignor Martinez?</i>

03:15.645 --> 03:16.612
<i>Pare se, Seρora</i>.

03:17.881 --> 03:21.009
If you put that tape in,
it will explode.

03:21.050 --> 03:23.518
The real Monsignor Martinez!

03:27.490 --> 03:30.118
Seρor, this is the sick boy
I was telling you about.

03:30.159 --> 03:31.285
He cannot talk.

03:31.327 --> 03:33.261
Be brave, little soldier.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.661
From now on

03:34.697 --> 03:38.565
you will be in the prayers
of Monsignor Martinez.

03:41.604 --> 03:44.368
Seρor, he should not be
out of his bubble for too long.

03:49.112 --> 03:50.670
If the moment is truthful

03:50.713 --> 03:53.307
then stabbing to death
El Jefe with an icicle

03:53.349 --> 03:55.783
will come almost
without conscious effort.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.183
Okay, kids, I'm afraid

03:57.220 --> 04:00.485
that is all the time we have
with our very special guest.

04:01.524 --> 04:03.321
Uh... uh... in Espanol.

04:03.359 --> 04:04.553
Aiii.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.125
That was the best...
You are the coolest...

04:09.165 --> 04:11.793
Oh, <i>gracias, gracias,</i>
Seρor Filipe.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.563
The children loved you.

04:13.603 --> 04:15.400
The pleasure was all mine.

04:15.438 --> 04:18.464
Sometimes I forget we have
many young viewers.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.601
We should probably do more
episodes

04:20.642 --> 04:22.304
like the one about the monkey

04:22.345 --> 04:25.075
who smuggled the cocaine
under his little hat.

04:25.114 --> 04:27.344
Seρora, I'm about
to have some lunch.

04:27.383 --> 04:28.372
Please, join me.

04:29.819 --> 04:32.879
I noticed you have
the same passion for teaching

04:32.922 --> 04:34.389
that I have for acting.

04:34.424 --> 04:36.585
<i>Gracias</i>.

04:36.626 --> 04:39.891
Hey, say, <i>Vay con Dios,</i> dude.

04:39.929 --> 04:40.953
Hey! Hey!

04:40.997 --> 04:41.986
Do not look over.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.726
It will only encourage them.

04:43.766 --> 04:45.028
<i>Vay con Dios,</i>

04:45.068 --> 04:46.899
you pant load.

04:46.936 --> 04:48.597
Seρora Hill, I have
two children

04:48.638 --> 04:50.572
who are about to take
entrance exams

04:50.606 --> 04:52.437
to private high school
in America.

04:52.475 --> 04:54.875
A teacher like yourself
with your passion,

04:54.911 --> 04:56.811
could help them pass
such a test.

04:56.846 --> 04:59.406
Would you be interested
in coming to Mexico

04:59.449 --> 05:00.711
to tutor my children?

05:00.750 --> 05:01.910
Really?

05:01.951 --> 05:04.920
I can see I have surprised
you with my offer.

05:04.954 --> 05:08.014
I will give you... a day
to think about it.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.423
Talk it over
with the loved ones.

05:10.460 --> 05:14.328
Oh, <i>seρor, I have</i>
something to confess.

05:14.364 --> 05:15.922
That boy in my classroom

05:15.965 --> 05:17.262
was not sick atall.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.498
Actually, that boy is my healthy
son Bobby.

05:21.537 --> 05:23.129
Seρora Hill, I am an actor.

05:23.172 --> 05:25.970
I could tell right away
that he was not sick.

05:26.009 --> 05:27.374
I do not mean

05:27.410 --> 05:30.277
to be unkind, but your son gave
a terrible performance.

05:30.313 --> 05:32.440
Yes, he was terrible,
wasn't he?

05:32.482 --> 05:33.449
Ah, yes.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.250
But not as terrible
as this fish! Waiter!

05:39.055 --> 05:41.523
Hank, are you going
to the propane convention

05:41.557 --> 05:42.785
in Alberta?

05:42.825 --> 05:44.759
There's a propane convention
in Alberta?

05:44.794 --> 05:46.352
It's exciting, isn't it?

05:46.396 --> 05:49.092
Oh, by you'll be
so far away... in Canada.

05:49.132 --> 05:51.032
Yeah, but no distance
is too great

05:51.067 --> 05:52.466
when it comes to propane.

05:52.502 --> 05:54.402
Mm-hmm, and I would
have no problem

05:54.437 --> 05:56.302
with you going
to that convention,

05:56.339 --> 05:57.829
even if it's for two weeks.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.501
I don't see why you would.

05:59.542 --> 06:02.272
Hank, there is no propane
convention in Alberta.

06:02.311 --> 06:03.141
What?

06:03.179 --> 06:05.170
But I have been offered

06:05.214 --> 06:06.681
a job in Mexico.

06:06.716 --> 06:08.843
The actor who plays
Monsignor Martinez

06:08.885 --> 06:10.216
wants me to go to Mexico

06:10.253 --> 06:12.551
and be a private tutor
for his children.

06:12.588 --> 06:14.283
It will only be for two weeks.

06:14.323 --> 06:15.517
No way, Peggy.

06:15.558 --> 06:17.492
You only know this guy
through the television.

06:17.527 --> 06:18.858
Hank, can't you see

06:18.895 --> 06:21.955
what an incredible
opportunity this is for me?

06:21.998 --> 06:24.796
This is a real double whammy
for me, Peggy.

06:24.834 --> 06:28.270
You want to leave and there's
no propane convention.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.670
But if it means
that much to you,

06:30.706 --> 06:33.504
I guess you should give
this guy a call

06:33.543 --> 06:34.805
and tell him yes.

06:34.844 --> 06:36.436
Thank you, Hank.

06:38.548 --> 06:41.540
Luanne, I want you to look after
Bobby and Hank while I'm gone.

06:41.584 --> 06:43.848
I would have had you
practice with an egg first,

06:43.886 --> 06:44.853
but there's no time.

06:44.887 --> 06:46.252
You're trusting me?

06:46.289 --> 06:48.883
I will do such a good job
being you,

06:48.925 --> 06:52.190
that you will not even know
that you're gone.

06:54.397 --> 06:57.525
Well, I guess
I should get going.

06:57.567 --> 07:00.764
Wow, this is going to be
the first we'll be apart

07:00.803 --> 07:02.794
for more than
a couple of days.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.899
Yeah, uh, Peggy, remember
to take your glasses off

07:05.942 --> 07:08.103
before you take
a nap on the plane.

07:08.144 --> 07:10.374
I will, Hank.

07:10.413 --> 07:12.278
Peggy, not in the airport.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.971
I trust your flight was good.

07:39.008 --> 07:42.034
You know I've never flown
first class before.

07:42.078 --> 07:44.808
My husband says
coach is just as good...

07:44.847 --> 07:46.678
you get there
at the same time.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.343
Yes, yes.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.818
People who have never
flown first class always say that.

07:52.488 --> 07:54.046
Ah, Seρora Hill,

07:54.090 --> 07:56.684
These are my
children, your students.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.216
Antonio and Christina.

07:58.261 --> 07:59.956
<i>Hola, Seρora Hill</i>.

07:59.996 --> 08:01.122
<i>Hola</i>.

08:01.164 --> 08:02.961
Seρora, you have
had a long flight.

08:02.999 --> 08:05.092
May I suggest you
start fresh <i>manana</i>.

08:05.134 --> 08:06.931
Oh, <i>manana,</i> yes, of course.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.307
Let me show you around.

08:13.342 --> 08:15.435
<i>Mi casa es tu casa</i>.

08:15.478 --> 08:18.345
Seρora Hill, acting
is not my only passion.

08:18.381 --> 08:19.473
I have another...

08:19.515 --> 08:21.039
making homemade wine.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.776
I too have another passion...
Boggle.

08:24.820 --> 08:27.084
It is good to have
many passions, yes?

08:27.123 --> 08:29.250
I have always said...

08:29.292 --> 08:32.125
Uh, these blackouts
happen all the time in Mexico.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.221
One of my children was
conceived in such a blackout.

08:36.631 --> 08:39.965
Would you like to taste
my homemade wine, Seρora Hill?

08:43.272 --> 08:46.241
Well, you have the most
spectacular sunsets in Mexico.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.368
Yes, it is the pollution.

08:48.411 --> 08:50.777
My wife and I used to sit
out here every night

08:50.813 --> 08:53.577
and watch the sun
sink behind the city.

08:53.616 --> 08:57.712
If it's not too personal
a question, where is your wife?

08:57.753 --> 08:59.584
She is, uh...
how you say,

08:59.622 --> 09:01.852
with our ancestors.

09:01.891 --> 09:03.916
Oh, I am so sorry.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.552
I miss her very much.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.929
The heart can get lonely.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.194
More wine?

09:12.235 --> 09:14.999
More wine?

09:15.037 --> 09:18.803
Well, who could say no to a
glass of homemade Mexican wine?

09:25.214 --> 09:27.876
This is actually
pretty good, Luanne.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.249
I got the recipe from <i>Redbook</i>.

09:30.286 --> 09:32.686
Which is actually a magazine.

09:32.722 --> 09:34.019
Well, I'm done.

09:34.056 --> 09:35.182
See ya.

09:35.224 --> 09:36.316
See ya.

09:36.359 --> 09:37.553
Ooh, wait.

09:37.593 --> 09:39.788
I think you're supposed
to excuse yourself

09:39.829 --> 09:41.228
from the table properly.

09:41.264 --> 09:42.788
Sit down, please.

09:50.740 --> 09:54.141
May I be excused
from the table?

09:54.176 --> 09:55.803
Yes, you may.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.477
He's a lovely boy.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.641
Who? Bobby?

10:01.751 --> 10:03.082
Uh-uh-uh.

10:03.119 --> 10:05.713
We do not answer the phone
during dinner hour.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.916
Yes, we do.

10:09.091 --> 10:10.217
Hello.

10:10.259 --> 10:11.692
Hi, Honey, it's me.

10:11.727 --> 10:13.558
How's the new job going?

10:13.596 --> 10:15.154
Oh, it's great.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.665
Seρor Filipe took me
on a tour of his mansion.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.134
He showed me his private gym
and wine cellar,

10:20.169 --> 10:22.296
and I tasted some
of his homemade wine.

10:22.338 --> 10:24.397
That sounds unnecessary.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.465
Oh, he was just being courtly.

10:26.509 --> 10:27.476
He's Latin.

10:27.510 --> 10:28.636
That's what they do.

10:28.678 --> 10:29.645
They are courtly.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.273
Well, Hank, you know,
I should get some sleep.

10:33.316 --> 10:34.943
I start teaching tomorrow.
Love you.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.913
Uh... back at ya.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.124
My children have promised me

10:44.160 --> 10:46.219
that they will listen
to your every word

10:46.262 --> 10:48.253
as if you were their mother.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.787
For you, Seρora Hill.

10:49.832 --> 10:52.198
Oh, a mango.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.895
One of the passion fruits.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.563
<i>Gracias, seρor</i>.

10:56.839 --> 10:58.306
It's from the children.

10:58.341 --> 10:59.899
Oh, right, Uh-huh.

10:59.942 --> 11:01.102
The children.

11:02.645 --> 11:03.839
Gribble residence.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.244
Nancy, it's Peggy.

11:05.281 --> 11:08.148
Eduardo is flirting
with me big time.

11:08.184 --> 11:10.049
I think he is coming on to me.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.144
Are you sure?

11:11.187 --> 11:13.121
Uh-huh. He used the familiar

11:13.155 --> 11:15.123
<i>tu casa</i> instead of <i>su casa</i>.

11:15.157 --> 11:18.058
We drank wine on a balcony
and watched the sunset.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.220
Where's the wife?
Dead.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.250
Perfect.
Did you flirt back?

11:20.296 --> 11:21.160
I do not know.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.596
Did you blush and giggle?

11:22.631 --> 11:24.690
I may have blushed
and giggled once or twice.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.532
Congratulations, sug.
You were flirting.

11:27.570 --> 11:30.698
But I got to warn you:
Don't enjoy it too much,

11:30.740 --> 11:34.176
because there's this moment
where there is no turning back.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.236
All of a sudden you can't
remember your husband's name.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.803
Your body goes limp,

11:38.848 --> 11:42.579
and then you are pulled down
by the undertow of passion.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.951
You're drowning, sug,
but you don't care.

11:45.988 --> 11:47.387
I will never drown

11:47.423 --> 11:50.620
because I am wearing the
best life preserver there is...

11:50.659 --> 11:52.718
my marriage to Hank.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.105
Margarita.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.612
I want you, Margarita.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.807
I want you like I've wanted
no other woman.

12:12.848 --> 12:15.817
And I am afraid you
cannot have me, Eduardo,

12:15.851 --> 12:19.014
for I have given my heart
to another... Hank Hill.

12:19.054 --> 12:21.750
Oh, I hate this Hank Hill
for stealing your heart.

12:21.791 --> 12:24.817
Please, I must have you now,
or I will throw myself

12:24.860 --> 12:26.919
off this cliff.

12:26.962 --> 12:30.830
I must refuse your advances
for the second time.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.896
Eduardo! No!

12:36.939 --> 12:38.099
Think of the children!

12:38.140 --> 12:40.665
What is the capital of Oregon?

12:40.709 --> 12:44.110
Seρora Hill, what is
the capital of Oregon?

12:44.146 --> 12:45.704
Huh? Uh, Portland.

12:45.748 --> 12:46.772
No, no, Salem.

12:46.816 --> 12:48.716
Are you sure, Seρora?

12:48.751 --> 12:50.548
Who's the American here?

12:50.586 --> 12:52.781
Hey, Luanne, did
you buy any beer?

12:52.822 --> 12:54.756
I know you wanted me
to get a case of beer,

12:54.790 --> 12:56.690
but it's not very healthy,

12:56.725 --> 13:00.058
so I got a case
of V-8juice instead.

13:00.095 --> 13:02.620
But it's my week to bring
the beer out to the alley.

13:02.665 --> 13:06.499
Uncle Hank, V-8juice
has eight vitamins.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.299
Beer has one: Barley.

13:12.942 --> 13:15.035
So Peggy phoned
Nancy last night

13:15.077 --> 13:17.272
and apparently
this Eduardo fella

13:17.313 --> 13:18.905
is real sweet on Peggy.

13:18.948 --> 13:19.937
What?

13:19.982 --> 13:21.574
Dale, I think Nancy
must have had

13:21.617 --> 13:23.107
a bad connection or something

13:23.152 --> 13:24.449
because I talked to Peggy

13:24.487 --> 13:27.047
and she said that Eduardo
was just being courtly.

13:27.089 --> 13:30.991
Mmm... no...

13:31.026 --> 13:32.186
Doesn't surprise me.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.059
Peggy's a very
beautiful woman.

13:34.096 --> 13:35.427
Shut up, Bill.

13:35.464 --> 13:38.194
Why? Don't you think Peggy
is beautiful, Hank?

13:38.234 --> 13:39.963
Of course I do.

13:40.002 --> 13:42.334
I just don't feel the need
to say it is all.

13:45.774 --> 13:47.366
<i>And that</i>

13:47.409 --> 13:49.309
is why it is called Pittsburgh.

13:49.345 --> 13:50.369
Ah, Seρora.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.936
Seρora, I need your help, uh,

13:51.981 --> 13:53.414
in the running some lines.

13:59.221 --> 14:02.657
Okay... you are the Ambassador's
beautiful daughter

14:02.691 --> 14:04.249
who speaks no Spanish.

14:04.293 --> 14:07.319
We hide in the drug lord's
greenhouse.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.354
It is hot, very, very hot,

14:09.398 --> 14:11.127
and also very dangerous.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.963
You must stand close.

14:14.136 --> 14:17.196
Oh, well, it is
how people would stand

14:17.239 --> 14:19.730
in a hot,
dangerous greenhouse.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.142
The one thing more
dangerous than my enemies

14:23.178 --> 14:24.873
is your beauty.

14:24.914 --> 14:26.176
"Hold me tight.

14:26.215 --> 14:29.844
I so greatly fear
these enemies who threaten us."

14:29.885 --> 14:33.480
Hush, Rebecca. I believe
my enemies are coming.

14:33.522 --> 14:34.784
And I also believe

14:34.823 --> 14:37.257
that I am falling
in love with you.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.592
Oh, God,
that is good dialogue.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.155
I need an <i>agua de frutas</i> break.

14:47.703 --> 14:52.402
Uncle Hank, we need to have
a serious talk about Bobby.

14:52.441 --> 14:53.567
No we don't.

14:53.609 --> 14:55.133
Now, Bobby's at an age

14:55.177 --> 14:57.372
where we should be
giving him his

14:57.413 --> 14:58.903
Sex talk.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.644
Luanne, stop trying to be
yourAunt Peggy.

15:01.684 --> 15:02.776
You're no Peggy.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.012
You're fired.

15:04.053 --> 15:06.283
Well, I'm glad
you're firing me,

15:06.322 --> 15:07.983
'cause being Aunt Peggy

15:08.023 --> 15:10.856
is the most thankless
job I've ever had!

15:10.893 --> 15:14.522
No wonder she ran
away to Mexico!

15:20.002 --> 15:21.264
<i>Ai!</i>

15:21.303 --> 15:23.601
Oh, I'm sorry I frightened you,
Seρor Filipe.

15:23.639 --> 15:25.072
You did not frighten me.

15:25.107 --> 15:26.074
We need to talk.

15:27.109 --> 15:28.269
Excuse me, Margarita,

15:28.310 --> 15:30.608
but those must be
the roses I had delivered.

15:30.646 --> 15:31.738
Roses?

15:31.780 --> 15:32.872
Yeah, I know this is not

15:32.915 --> 15:34.348
what I brought you
up here for,

15:34.383 --> 15:36.044
but would you mind
getting the roses

15:36.085 --> 15:37.552
and bringing them
to my bedroom?

15:38.587 --> 15:39.918
<i>Si</i>.

15:46.228 --> 15:48.628
Uh, could you place the roses
on the bed?

15:48.664 --> 15:51.030
Maybe... maybe spread
the petals around?

15:51.066 --> 15:53.034
It needs a woman's touch, yes?

15:53.068 --> 15:55.536
Look, Seρor,
we really need to talk.

15:55.571 --> 15:56.936
Uh, y-yes, I remember,

15:56.972 --> 15:59.566
but I need a moment
to, uh, prepare myself

15:59.608 --> 16:02.304
and then I will give
you my full attentions.

16:20.629 --> 16:23.223
with a naked, wet,
Latin television star.

16:23.265 --> 16:25.256
All right, then what, Peggy?
Huh?

16:25.367 --> 16:27.267
All right, then what, Peggy?
You'll forget what's-his-name...

16:27.302 --> 16:28.894
Oh, God, what <i>is</i> his name?

16:28.937 --> 16:30.666
Hank! Hank Hill.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.230
No, no, no.

16:32.274 --> 16:35.004
I will not give that man the
thrill of me seeing him naked.

16:35.044 --> 16:36.102
No!

16:37.513 --> 16:41.244
Seρora Hill, what in
God's name are you doing?

16:41.283 --> 16:43.080
Stop playing coy with me,
Eduardo.

16:43.118 --> 16:45.086
I must insist that you leave,
Seρora.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.678
All right, I am not leaving

16:46.722 --> 16:48.690
until you wrap this towel
around you

16:48.724 --> 16:50.749
and you listen
to what I have to say.

16:50.793 --> 16:54.752
Seρor Filipe, I understand
that my being an American woman

16:54.797 --> 16:56.059
may seem exotic...

16:56.098 --> 16:58.293
Uh, my wife has
come home early.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.595
What? Yourwife?!

17:03.972 --> 17:05.165
Oh, God, what do we do?

17:05.207 --> 17:06.195
What do we do?

17:06.241 --> 17:07.765
I will go down to greet her.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.107
Yes! Yes! That's good!

17:09.144 --> 17:10.167
Go! Go! Go!

17:11.213 --> 17:12.145
The roses!

17:31.433 --> 17:34.129
Seρora Hill...

17:34.169 --> 17:35.898
where are the roses?

17:35.938 --> 17:37.838
Don't worry. I
took care of them.

17:37.873 --> 17:39.306
Now, where is your wife?

17:39.341 --> 17:41.832
Uh, Seρora Hill,
this is my wife Maria.

17:41.877 --> 17:42.969
<i>Hola</i>.

17:43.011 --> 17:44.911
I... I thought you were dead.

17:44.947 --> 17:47.780
No. I was with my ancestors.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.147
No, not my ancestors...

17:49.184 --> 17:51.914
my, uh... <i>ay, como se dice</i>...

17:51.954 --> 17:54.149
My grandparents.

17:54.189 --> 17:55.554
Yes, yes, I told her this.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.889
Seρora Filipe, I
just want you to know

17:57.926 --> 17:59.894
that nothing happened
between us.

17:59.928 --> 18:03.261
Even though I was flattered
by your husband's advances,

18:03.298 --> 18:05.562
I am a happily married woman.

18:05.601 --> 18:06.863
I am so sorry,

18:06.902 --> 18:09.268
but I will not be able
to satisfy your lust for me.

18:09.304 --> 18:11.204
Oh, wait, wait...
l-I am sorry,

18:11.240 --> 18:13.231
I am not sure I understand.

18:13.776 --> 18:15.539
You...

18:15.577 --> 18:18.569
You thought
I wanted you as a lover?

18:18.614 --> 18:19.740
Well, yes.

18:19.782 --> 18:22.046
Well, you couldn't have been
more obvious...

18:22.084 --> 18:23.346
the mango, the roses...

18:23.385 --> 18:25.853
The roses were a surprise
for my wife.

18:25.888 --> 18:28.482
Well, of course you would
say that in front of her.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.152
But you cannot deny your
constant flirting with me.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.993
I mean, the wine, the familiar
use of "tu" instead of "su".

18:35.030 --> 18:37.055
I was just being a good host.

18:37.099 --> 18:38.396
Seρora, I am sorry,

18:38.433 --> 18:41.527
but I do not desire you
in that way at all.

18:41.570 --> 18:45.301
You are, how you
say, um... old.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.433
Old? I am not old.

18:47.476 --> 18:49.376
I am only 41.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.276
Oh, no, I've done it again.

18:52.314 --> 18:54.305
Anyway, I would never, never,

18:54.349 --> 18:56.112
never take you as a lover.

18:56.151 --> 18:57.277
I got it.

18:57.319 --> 18:59.253
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

18:59.288 --> 19:01.722
Uh, yes, it's quite comical.

19:01.757 --> 19:04.225
Look, my wife
finds it comical as well.

19:06.795 --> 19:09.059
Oh... uh...

19:09.097 --> 19:11.065
I'm... I'm sorry.

19:14.002 --> 19:16.402
Hello? Strickland Propane.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.429
Hi, Hank. It's me.

19:18.473 --> 19:20.100
I just thought
you would like to know

19:20.142 --> 19:21.507
that I'm coming home tomorrow.

19:21.543 --> 19:25.240
Turns out my students
were really fast learners.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.114
Well, uh, I'm glad
you're coming back.

19:29.151 --> 19:30.778
It's not the same without you.

19:30.819 --> 19:32.878
Uh, we miss you.

19:34.156 --> 19:38.058
My flight number
is Mexicana Airlines, 710.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.754
Okay, bye!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.229
I have contacted
another teacher for your children.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.363
Her name is Sandra Morgan.

19:50.405 --> 19:52.566
She's 61 years old.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.405
<i>She</i> is old.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.776
Well, then, <i>via con dios</i>.

19:57.813 --> 20:01.715
I meant that as myself,
not as, you know, the character.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.988
Welcome home to Texas, Peggy.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.724
Where is the truck?

20:17.566 --> 20:18.590
Oh, no!

20:18.634 --> 20:19.692
What's this on the floor?

20:19.735 --> 20:21.168
Hank, I...

20:21.203 --> 20:23.034
I have been on a plane
all night.

20:23.071 --> 20:24.265
Whatever is on the floor

20:24.306 --> 20:25.933
I will pick it up
in the morning.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.271
Hey, looks like

20:27.309 --> 20:29.140
chocolates, and, uh...

20:29.177 --> 20:31.771
wow, they're, uh, Kisses.

20:31.813 --> 20:32.939
Did you do this?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.472
Yeah. I got it
from the <i>Redbook</i>.

20:35.517 --> 20:37.178
Hey, I wonder where they go?

20:37.219 --> 20:38.709
Do they lead to our bed?

20:38.754 --> 20:39.812
Maybe.

20:45.894 --> 20:47.452
They don't lead to the bed.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.861
Nope. Keep going.

20:48.897 --> 20:50.330
To the bathroom?

20:50.365 --> 20:51.354
Uh...

20:51.400 --> 20:53.891
Okay, the tub.

20:53.936 --> 20:56.461
Hank, did you buy
scented candles?

21:05.981 --> 21:08.074
I am tired and I give up.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.549
What am I looking for?

21:09.584 --> 21:11.484
His-and-her sinks.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.720
Well, that's
yours right there.

21:12.721 --> 21:13.921
Turn on the tap.
Give it a try.

21:15.657 --> 21:17.591
You don't like it.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.350
Hank,

21:20.395 --> 21:22.363
I love it.

21:22.397 --> 21:23.921
<i>You know how you
always complain</i>

21:23.966 --> 21:25.991
<i>that I was shaving
and leaving hairs in the sink?</i>

21:26.034 --> 21:27.865
<i>Well, Joe Jack
heard about this plumber</i>

21:27.903 --> 21:29.928
