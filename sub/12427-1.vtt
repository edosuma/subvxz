WEBVTT

00:59.526 --> 01:01.050
Are you dreaming?

01:07.267 --> 01:08.199
Here,

01:08.868 --> 01:09.892
now?

01:18.711 --> 01:20.076
Look at your hands.

01:20.513 --> 01:21.502
One.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.207
Your fingers.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.338
Two.

01:26.052 --> 01:27.383
How many are there?

01:27.520 --> 01:28.509
Three.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.252
Count again.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.381
Four.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.526
Often.
- Five.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.095
Count again.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.527
One. Six.

01:38.631 --> 01:41.031
Compulsively.
- Seven. Two.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.533
Obsessively.

01:42.635 --> 01:45.900
Three. Eight. Two.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.563
Do it so often that

01:48.241 --> 01:49.401
one day

01:52.045 --> 01:53.569
you'll do it

01:56.082 --> 01:57.379
in your dreams.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.580
One. Six. Two.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.118
But in your dreams

02:08.294 --> 02:09.955
you won't be able to.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.393
Because in your dreams

02:17.837 --> 02:19.805
there will always be...

02:21.608 --> 02:22.836
a kind of sign.

02:24.844 --> 02:25.936
Eleven.

03:37.183 --> 03:41.483
Our next speaker
is director of research at the CEI.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.820
She taught quantum and particle
physics here in Montréal

03:45.925 --> 03:49.725
and is professor of
the history of science in Luxemburg.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.397
Please welcome Simone De Koninck.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.174
The external world exists.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.669
Perhaps.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.068
Perhaps not.

04:09.515 --> 04:13.508
We perceive the external world
through our senses, but

04:13.786 --> 04:15.515
our senses deceive us.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.349
So we cannot really know
the external world.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.527
Certain animals and insects
whose sense organs differ from ours

04:25.698 --> 04:27.222
perceive reality...

04:27.433 --> 04:30.459
the same reality... differently.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.199
Imagine a film

04:34.374 --> 04:36.239
projected on a screen.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.144
A film consists of still images.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.576
24 stills, one after the other,
every second.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.647
This quick succession
tricks our eyes,

04:47.954 --> 04:50.388
creating the illusion of movement.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.659
Let's take the fly as an example.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.131
The visual perception of a fly
is four times faster than ours.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.071
In other words,
its eyes are so sensitive

05:06.172 --> 05:10.131
and its nervous system is so fast
in interpreting reality

05:10.276 --> 05:12.972
that what it sees
looking at the film

05:13.112 --> 05:14.909
is like a slide show.

05:24.824 --> 05:29.352
Contrary to us, it does not perceive
movement on the screen,

05:29.495 --> 05:31.326
only fixed photographs.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.190
Its visual perception of reality

05:34.334 --> 05:37.497
is closer to what we'd call
objective reality...

05:37.637 --> 05:40.128
namely, what is really projected...

05:40.273 --> 05:42.138
than our perception of reality.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.977
Thus, everything we perceive,

05:48.614 --> 05:49.979
we deform.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.042
So my question is:

05:53.986 --> 05:56.784
How do we deform time?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.619
He friend-zoned me.
- What's that?

06:43.703 --> 06:48.023
He goes, like..." Bla bla bla,
I want you to know I feel nothing.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.325
We're friends."

06:49.409 --> 06:52.674
So like, I have to reply,
as if I don't care...

06:52.845 --> 06:54.608
Is he that hottie?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.276
I thought he had a fever.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.513
Want some advice?

07:00.219 --> 07:01.777
What?
- If you're into...

07:01.954 --> 07:05.583
No, Dad. It means
you're into each other and going...

07:06.025 --> 07:07.014
to date.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.452
You never understand!

07:14.434 --> 07:15.799
Have a good week.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.924
Bye.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.821
"Love you, Dad?"

07:18.905 --> 07:20.236
Hate you, Dad.

07:20.807 --> 07:21.774
Hey!

07:22.041 --> 07:23.230
Be right out.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.034
Why are you here?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.081
I'm spending three days with you.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.311
You happy?

07:36.622 --> 07:37.816
Gimme a smile.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.614
Simone, come on!

07:39.792 --> 07:41.384
Stop, don't touch me!

08:22.435 --> 08:24.460
I let her go.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.344
You alright?

08:36.649 --> 08:37.938
I was dreaming.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.313
I was being watched.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.182
And you were alive.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.500
You left your math book at Dad's?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.655
I'll be a sec. You coming?
- I'm beat.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.726
Come see the new office.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.418
Édouard? It's Daphné.

09:56.629 --> 10:00.030
My code doesn't work.
Is it different on weekends?

10:04.904 --> 10:06.269
It's fucking long.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.138
So go get her.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.105
I'm too beat.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.906
Go on, cabbage.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.079
Nugget.

10:17.817 --> 10:18.806
Larva.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.419
Snail.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.379
Lazybones.

10:22.588 --> 10:23.486
Microbe.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.473
Air head.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.717
Mollusk.

10:26.926 --> 10:27.790
Newfie.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.956
OK, Einstein.
- Boobie. Moron.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.695
OK, enough...
- Derp.

10:33.966 --> 10:34.955
Derp?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.733
Were you scared?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.275
No, I wasn't scared.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.380
They came in and...

13:07.119 --> 13:10.384
The man pushed her to the ground.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.092
Then he lifted her head.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.398
He slammed her face on the floor.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.466
How did you feel?

13:31.343 --> 13:34.904
Had you ever witnessed
violence like that before?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.939
Well, I've seen fights.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.778
In hockey, or the schoolyard.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.785
I never saw anyone die.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.495
What happens when you faint?

13:50.796 --> 13:52.457
When you faint?

13:53.299 --> 13:55.529
Was it the first time you fainted?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.368
When I was on the floor
in the stairs...

14:04.276 --> 14:06.642
Like, where was I?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.440
Was I, like...

14:11.116 --> 14:12.048
When?

14:53.792 --> 14:57.193
When the patient mouth
lays bare the being

14:57.529 --> 15:03.434
We cannot foresee among the waves
the breaking one.

15:05.437 --> 15:10.033
The split second that makes
the image in the bodies' narration

15:10.175 --> 15:13.440
Spinning at the speed of the image

15:15.180 --> 15:17.705
We cannot foresee how the tongue

15:18.350 --> 15:22.343
will wrap around the clitoris

15:22.888 --> 15:24.617
To raise the body

15:25.457 --> 15:29.086
And move it, cell by cell

15:29.595 --> 15:31.085
Into unreality

16:50.709 --> 16:51.698
Simone?

16:52.811 --> 16:53.975
What is that?

16:54.213 --> 16:56.613
Stop, it's gross. It's got germs.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.551
What's it like to lick a tongue?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.627
You mean, kissing?

17:20.005 --> 17:21.472
Is it slimy?

17:26.478 --> 17:28.002
We have to talk.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.744
We've been through
a major change, right?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.150
Mom's dead. I know.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.929
You two were very close. Well...

17:51.737 --> 17:53.170
I'm going to try...

17:54.073 --> 17:55.438
Are you listening?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.503
Yes, Mathieu.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.177
But it doesn't matter.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.176
Don't worry, you're a good father.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.202
Grégoire!

18:50.062 --> 18:52.053
Have you ever fainted?

18:52.564 --> 18:53.997
Yeah.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.293
Rocket ride?

19:00.539 --> 19:01.656
Choking game?

19:01.740 --> 19:03.608
Want to do it?
- No.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.813
Will you French me?

19:18.023 --> 19:19.786
So I know what it's like.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.025
I'm your cousin.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.192
So?

19:25.464 --> 19:26.929
I have a girlfriend.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.021
And?

19:28.967 --> 19:30.366
You never...?

20:07.906 --> 20:09.437
It's your first time?

20:10.342 --> 20:11.969
You know it's dangerous?

20:13.178 --> 20:14.672
Well, it's dangerous.

20:15.681 --> 20:19.048
Lean forward with your head down.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.217
Take five big breaths, really deep.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.914
Hold the last one.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.626
I abandoned her.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.781
See her.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.248
What?

21:29.254 --> 21:30.653
Miss De Koninck?

21:40.899 --> 21:42.298
As you know,

21:43.101 --> 21:45.899
you'll go into a very deep sleep,

21:47.105 --> 21:50.905
and we'll visit your memory
of the event you witnessed,

21:51.643 --> 21:53.474
the attack on your mother.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.745
We'll start now.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.284
Look at my finger.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.687
Your eyelids are getting
heavier and heavier.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.322
Heavier and heavier.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.693
Heavier and heavier.

22:18.770 --> 22:19.759
Yes.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.433
Your eyes are fluttering.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.211
Your eyelids
are getting ever heavier.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.211
You completely let go.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.214
Yes.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.624
Bring your head forward.

22:50.335 --> 22:54.169
Now, I want you to go back in time

22:55.474 --> 22:57.669
to the murder of your mother.

23:05.917 --> 23:07.214
I'm walking.

23:11.923 --> 23:12.719
OK.

23:14.693 --> 23:15.682
Here I go.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.666
Are you alright?

24:12.984 --> 24:14.742
Simone? What's happening?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.451
Don't.
- It's Mom.

24:17.756 --> 24:18.950
It's her.

24:22.394 --> 24:23.952
She wants to live.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.926
I let her go.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.166
You alright?

24:37.776 --> 24:39.341
Yeah, I was dreaming.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.574
I was being watched.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.311
You were alive.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.125
Yes?

24:57.596 --> 24:59.757
You left your math book at Dad's?

25:00.198 --> 25:06.034
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.233
That felt weird.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.079
I was far away.

25:53.985 --> 25:54.747
OK.

25:58.857 --> 25:59.853
My turn.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.494
Pull on this.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.495
On one condition.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.695
Afterward, we French.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.497
We'll see.

27:55.373 --> 27:57.534
My name is Simone De Koninck.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.003
I'm at St-Sylvestre College.

28:00.812 --> 28:05.875
My cousin Grégoire's unconscious
in the basement here.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.512
I choked him so he'd faint
but he didn't wake up.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.747
What are you doing?

28:48.860 --> 28:49.849
Simone?

29:00.939 --> 29:03.430
Could you leave us alone?

29:06.377 --> 29:07.366
Get out.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.982
I'll wait.

30:18.183 --> 30:19.172
Mom?

30:20.952 --> 30:23.182
There is no key

30:23.354 --> 30:25.447
Only dreaming bodies

30:26.624 --> 30:29.957
But what do
all these bodies dream of?

30:33.164 --> 30:33.994
Repeat!

34:13.251 --> 34:14.478
Simone?

34:16.987 --> 34:17.976
Help me.

34:20.658 --> 34:21.487
Simone?

34:25.862 --> 34:26.920
Help me.

34:40.777 --> 34:42.574
I abandoned her.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.244
I didn't go to...

34:50.021 --> 34:51.386
see her.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.025
I let her go.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.087
Mom's dead, Dad.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.292
We'll never see her again.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.431
It's my fault.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.501
It's not your fault, my love.

36:58.349 --> 37:03.548
Time advances in continuous,
unidirectional movement.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.216
But what if that were wrong,

37:09.827 --> 37:14.025
as is our perception
of a film in a cinema?

37:15.533 --> 37:19.435
What if time changed direction?

37:20.871 --> 37:22.361
Or divided?

37:23.941 --> 37:26.842
Imagine it circled back on itself

37:28.379 --> 37:31.041
or splintered into pieces?

37:32.750 --> 37:36.584
What if time didn't move at all.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.748
lf, instead,
we were the ones moving?

37:41.559 --> 37:45.427
Modern physics has redefined
the notion of time.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.598
Einstein showed that time
accelerates, slows,

37:50.735 --> 37:54.136
and in distant reaches of
the universe, near black holes,

37:54.538 --> 37:57.029
time can even almost stop.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.139
Where does time come from,

38:01.445 --> 38:05.643
this shifting concept, this
indefinable sensation of movement?

38:05.883 --> 38:08.875
And above all, does it really exist?

38:10.087 --> 38:13.818
Relativists believe
the future is already here,

38:13.991 --> 38:17.791
but we are simply not there yet.

38:19.096 --> 38:23.795
The future is already here,
but we are not there yet.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.167
Space-time is like a block

38:27.338 --> 38:31.775
inside which past, present
and future exist simultaneously.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.307
Regrettably, this means

38:34.779 --> 38:37.839
history... ours
and that of the universe,

38:38.082 --> 38:41.074
which recounts our births
but also our deaths...

38:41.185 --> 38:43.176
is written in advance.

38:43.688 --> 38:44.916
All of it.

38:45.956 --> 38:51.485
Why doesn't our brain have access
to the complete block?

38:52.330 --> 38:56.130
Why do we remember the past
but not the future?

38:56.934 --> 38:59.869
Perhaps we have access
to the future too,

39:00.037 --> 39:04.497
but simply don't have
conscious access to it.

39:06.711 --> 39:10.943
It seems that the nature of time
of the unconscious

39:11.349 --> 39:16.377
is closer to reality
than the time of consciousness.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.982
The time of unconsciousness

39:22.159 --> 39:27.529
is closer to reality than
the limited time of consciousness.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.282
Your photo is now online

43:28.072 --> 43:30.267
Hi, Mr Porter. You wanted me?

43:32.109 --> 43:33.269
Hi, Mr Porter...

43:41.552 --> 43:43.918
Hi Mr Porter. You wanted to see me?

43:53.931 --> 43:55.626
Hi, Mr Porter. You...

43:56.500 --> 43:57.626
wanted...

43:58.602 --> 44:00.126
You'll work two shifts.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.632
Saturday and

44:02.773 --> 44:04.172
Tuesday. Yes.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.943
Double shifts. It's good money.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.109
OK. I'll be there.

44:10.681 --> 44:12.273
OK, fine. That's enough!

44:16.987 --> 44:18.738
OK, everything's fine.

44:18.822 --> 44:19.952
What's that?

44:20.057 --> 44:22.189
Oh, and Thursday too.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.002
You see,

44:32.503 --> 44:33.697
it's just that...

44:34.972 --> 44:36.098
next week

44:36.674 --> 44:38.107
Thursday there's...

44:38.809 --> 44:40.003
I have a final.

44:41.779 --> 44:44.509
Like, a final exam in...

44:46.350 --> 44:48.344
Like,

44:47.284 --> 44:50.117
a final exam that I'd like...

44:50.220 --> 44:51.812
that I have to do. It's...

44:51.955 --> 44:53.513
It's like a course in...

44:53.757 --> 44:54.574
math.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.353
So complicated!
- It's a...

44:56.794 --> 44:57.954
course in...

44:58.062 --> 44:58.853
math.

45:00.631 --> 45:01.388
What?

45:03.200 --> 45:04.189
Erase me.

45:07.004 --> 45:08.062
What is it?

45:11.508 --> 45:13.408
I'm falling.

45:57.054 --> 45:58.043
Simone,

46:00.758 --> 46:01.918
help me.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.237
Oh yeah?

51:19.109 --> 51:20.201
Mom?

51:31.221 --> 51:32.279
Yes, Simone?

51:49.739 --> 51:51.536
Your eyelids are heavy.

51:57.747 --> 51:59.806
Your eyelids are getting heavier.

52:00.750 --> 52:01.944
Come, Simone.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.419
Heavier and heavier.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.419
Heavier and heavier.

52:12.829 --> 52:14.057
Come, honey.

52:14.965 --> 52:18.731
You completely let go.

52:20.303 --> 52:21.395
Come closer.

52:26.443 --> 52:27.467
That's it.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.659
Closer.

53:14.624 --> 53:15.682
Hello?

54:29.966 --> 54:31.263
I knew it.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.569
It's her.

54:38.074 --> 54:39.098
Again.

54:41.478 --> 54:42.706
Why again?

54:44.447 --> 54:45.471
This is bad.

54:48.451 --> 54:49.611
He'll kill her.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.480
He'll kill her.

56:01.658 --> 56:03.052
I abandoned her.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.222
I abandoned her.

56:08.665 --> 56:09.893
I let her go.

56:22.712 --> 56:23.679
Hello?

56:34.357 --> 56:35.381
Mom?

57:25.141 --> 57:26.733
What's going on?

57:27.710 --> 57:29.268
What's going on?

57:31.414 --> 57:32.742
Why's he here?

59:20.590 --> 59:21.950
Can I help you?

59:29.032 --> 59:30.556
Are you on the list?

59:31.868 --> 59:32.835
Yes.

59:35.872 --> 59:37.232
What's your name?

59:38.174 --> 59:39.198
Élie.

59:41.044 --> 59:41.942
Turing.

59:44.047 --> 59:45.446
Ms Turing...
- Yes.

59:45.615 --> 59:46.882
...just arrived.

59:48.017 --> 59:49.211
Sure, I know.

59:52.722 --> 59:54.553
Go ahead, I don't care.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.463
Nothing is foreseen

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:07.432
We don't know what happens
to the world's image

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:11.033
When the patience of lips
lays bare the being

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.027
I don't have a... No, thanks.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:19.047
We cannot foresee among the waves
the breaking one

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:23.747
The split second that makes
the image in the bodies' narration

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.444
Spinning at the speed of the image

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:32.326
We cannot foresee how the tongue
will wrap around the clitoris

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.921
To raise the body

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:38.332
And move it, cell by cell

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.132
Into unreality

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.081
Hello.

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.610
I'm Simone,

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.047
your neighbor.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.348
I don't have...

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.582
I've never really...

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.793
I've never made love.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.204
You?

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.169
Have you ever...

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.644
Of course.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.956
Would you kiss me?

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.242
I who grieve

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.306
You whom I desire

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.304
There is no key

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.175
Only dreaming bodies

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:45.180
But who do they all dream of?

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:18.785
Idiot!

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.882
Erase me. Erase me!

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.183
Hello.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:29.124
Yes, I'm your neighbor opposite.

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.658
I live right...

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.132
I live there.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.300
I think you have my iPad.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.739
We met in the subway.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.200
I'm not German.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.645
Obviously I'm not German.

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.077
I think that

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.445
the other day, I...

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.378
Hello.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.017
Your neighbor.

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.587
It's me.

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:49.890
Mr Porter?

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:18.484
Who's there?

01:09:20.288 --> 01:09:22.189
What's happening?

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.026
Mom!

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.629
Mom!

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.524
You fainted, my dear.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:38.629
Self-awareness is a fundamental
trait of human nature.

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:47.036
We are aware of our existence,
our individuality, but above all,

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.802
our death.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.172
Alive today,

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.976
dead tomorrow.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:16:02.847
The opposition of these certitudes
creates the impression of movement.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.391
We advance toward death.

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:12.429
Our coming death propels us
into the future.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:19.073
This telescoping leads to
the sensation of movement,

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.867
of time passing by.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.114
Time is thus quite simply

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:32.186
a side effect of awareness.

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.740
What's happening?

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.677
You fainted, dear.

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:49.718
Simone...

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.583
You were napping.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.489
You moaned.

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:58.095
I think you even came.

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.602
You were there.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.905
You got up.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.177
You put your hands to your face.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.412
