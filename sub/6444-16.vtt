00:36.480 --> 00:37.754
There's the hut.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.673
Let's hope word of the evac order
made it out this far.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.637
Let's go.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.517
Good God.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.433
Son of a bitch.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.640
All right, let's get blood samples.
Ten cc's each.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.869
Right.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.192
Hey, this is a quarantined
hot zone. Get out! Now!

01:54.000 --> 01:55.274
Did you hear me?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.556
You're exposing yourself
to a deadly virus.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.957
Clark, you're amazing.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.714
Okay, so you're not gonna
win any dance contests...

03:41.880 --> 03:43.677
<i>...but</i> you're definitely not the worst.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.912
Lana, I almost started a 10-person
pileup doing the two-step.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.469
We should skip the dancing
before someone gets hurt.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.029
Well, maybe we should try
something else more often.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.474
Like what?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.029
Well, I'll give you a hint.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.352
Chloe happens to be pulling
an all nighter at the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

04:02.600 --> 04:04.750
So you have the dorm room
all to yourself.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.871
All to ourselves.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.114
That sounds great, it really does.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.477
But I have to get back to the farm.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.473
It's gonna rain tomorrow
and I have to put up some tarps.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.158
Clark, whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.833
As long as it takes.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.077
No pressure.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.958
Lana.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.634
I gotta go, it's getting late.
But I'll talk to you tomorrow.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.916
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.474
I thought she'd never leave.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.712
Hi, I'm Simone.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.439
I was just leaving.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.158
What's the hurry?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.075
You're not going anywhere
until I tell you to.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.149
Okay.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.956
You're gonna believe
everything I tell you...

05:23.120 --> 05:24.917
<i>...and</i> you're gonna do
everything I say.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.877
Starting now.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.792
What do you have in mind?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.958
Smallville?

05:56.320 --> 05:57.753
What the hell are you doing?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.914
Lois, I'd like you to meet <i>Simone...</i>

06:03.000 --> 06:04.592
...my new girlfriend.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.559
I got your text message.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.190
Lana, I apologize for interrupting
your Saturday night...

06:24.360 --> 06:26.191
...but I thought
you'd be interested.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.669
It's okay. I was just
on my way back to Metropolis.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.159
What's going on?

06:31.280 --> 06:34.590
My father taught me
never to reveal my hand...

06:34.760 --> 06:37.194
...but I consider you my partner.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.317
If it wasn't for you, I would have
never known the spacecraft existed.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.635
- Have you found the ship?
- No.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.836
But I have managed
to track down Milton Fine.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.231
- What does he got to do with this?
- He was seen several times around...

06:50.400 --> 06:53.119
...the warehouse where
I stored the spacecraft.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.396
And he happened
to disappear from Smallville...

06:55.560 --> 06:57.790
...the same exact day
the ship vanished.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.155
Something tells me
it's not a coincidence.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.636
So either you're planning
an exotic vacation...

07:04.800 --> 07:07.394
...or this professor is somewhere
in Central America?

07:07.560 --> 07:10.597
He was last seen in Honduras.
My jet leaves in an hour.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.798
Lex, let me come with you,
maybe I can help.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.349
Lana, I appreciate your passion...

07:20.520 --> 07:22.988
...but I have no idea
what I'm walking into.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.992
I can't risk putting you in danger.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.429
I promise, when I get back,
I'll tell you everything.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.558
Here you go.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.513
Apple pie. Well, what else?

07:46.920 --> 07:50.435
- My mom just made it.
- Of course she did.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.075
That's delicious.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.117
All I need now is
a glass of champagne.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.431
But I don't suppose you have that
hidden behind the marmalade.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.112
Clark?

08:11.720 --> 08:13.597
Clark?

08:17.200 --> 08:18.758
What did you...?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.271
- Where did you get that?
- Hal's Liquor Store in Metropolis.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.312
What?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.198
Metropolis? How?

08:29.360 --> 08:30.793
I can run really fast.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.597
So if I were to say, <i>"clark...</i>

08:36.360 --> 08:38.794
...I want some
chocolate-covered strawberries."

08:47.640 --> 08:49.153
Here you go.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.111
You are too good to be true.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.594
Yeah.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.509
I think it's time you told
your girlfriend about us.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.190
Call her and ask her to come over.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.151
Okay, I am the first person
to concede...

09:12.320 --> 09:14.515
...that anything is possible
in this universe...

09:14.680 --> 09:17.194
...but Clark Kent lip-Iocked
with another girl?

09:17.360 --> 09:20.318
Chloe, I'm telling you,
it was the last tango at the Talon.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.675
Unfortunately, I had front row seats.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.437
Well, something must have
happened to him...

09:27.600 --> 09:29.556
...because he wouldn't just do this.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.518
I know you have this whole
hero-worship thing with the guy...

09:32.680 --> 09:36.116
...but face it, Clark is no different
than any other red-blooded male.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.430
His brain, it's not his
commanding officer.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.955
No, you don't know him
like I do. He is different.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.475
- He wouldn't do this to Lana.
- He already has.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.030
- Lf Lana's our friend, we need to warn...
- No, hold your fire.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.510
Now, before you utter one word
to Lana about this, I just wan...

09:50.680 --> 09:51.954
One word about what?

09:54.520 --> 09:55.555
What's going on?

09:57.040 --> 10:00.237
Lois needs a place to stay.
She needs to stay at our dorm room...

10:00.400 --> 10:03.233
...for a couple of nights.
- Right, the heater's on the fritz.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.789
I just wanted to make sure
I brought it up to you...

10:05.960 --> 10:07.552
...before she said anything.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.915
Okay.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.833
Lois, you are always welcome here.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.072
- Great.
- Great.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.391
I thought you were
pulling an all nighter.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.478
Well, as much as I enjoy
a good dose of sleep deprivation...

10:20.640 --> 10:22.312
...my deadline was pushed.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.152
Nice.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.433
Hello. Hi.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.799
Oh, is everything all right?

10:34.080 --> 10:36.435
Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.431
- Who was that?
- That was Clark.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.239
He said he needs to talk to me.
Seems really urgent.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.836
I'll see you guys later.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.320
So, lightning legs...

11:01.040 --> 11:03.634
...got any other special skills?

11:04.120 --> 11:05.394
- Well, l...
- I wanna know...

11:05.560 --> 11:07.755
...everything you're capable of.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.033
An S for Simone.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.911
Ever since I was little, I dreamed
about my knight in shining armor.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.629
And now that dream
has actually come true.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.516
Take off your shirt.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.789
Your turn.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.950
Now, take off
the rest of your clothes.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.072
Simone...

12:29.640 --> 12:31.596
...with my powers...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.194
...I could hurt you.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.354
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.438
Make love to me, Clark.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.199
Oh, God.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.875
Oh, God.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.831
You don't care
about her anymore, Clark.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.911
Go tell her that it's over.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.630
Lana, wait.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.548
This is why you couldn't
spend the night with me?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.390
Lana, I've fallen in love
with someone else.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.438
Mr. Luthor?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.469
<i>Welcome, Simone.</i>

14:54.760 --> 14:56.876
<i>Don 't you look</i>
<i>delectable this evening.</i>

14:57.040 --> 15:00.077
Do I ever get to meet the billionaire
boy wonder face to face?

15:02.200 --> 15:05.397
Well, as much as I'd like
to admire you up close and personal...

15:05.560 --> 15:07.869
...I prefer to hold on to my free will.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.272
<i>How is your progress?</i>

15:11.440 --> 15:13.715
<i>Let's just say Lana Lang</i>
<i>won 't be sending Clark...</i>

15:13.880 --> 15:15.472
<i>... any more Valentine's Day cards.</i>

15:16.720 --> 15:18.756
And what about Clark?

15:18.920 --> 15:21.275
Have you discovered anything
unusual about him?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.113
Absolutely.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.878
What is it?

15:27.640 --> 15:31.599
<i>Clark Kent is the most extraordinary...</i>

15:32.560 --> 15:33.834
<i>... kisser.</i>

15:37.560 --> 15:39.118
There must be more.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.669
<i>If he had some secret,</i>
<i>don 't you think I would know?</i>

15:41.840 --> 15:45.435
With Clark Kent, what you see
is what you get. A corn-fed farm boy.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.511
<i>I've done everything</i>
<i>you've asked me to.</i>

15:47.680 --> 15:50.478
Now you can get the hell out
of my life and leave me alone.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.395
Patience, Simone.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.028
There's someone else
I'd like you to <i>meet...</i>

15:56.200 --> 15:58.919
...in Honduras.
- No way. This was a one-time deal.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.469
- Remember?
- Do you remember that I just...

16:01.640 --> 16:05.155
...unearthed evidence that could put you
in prison for the rest of your life?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.914
Now, I think the least you could do
is one more little favor for me.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.759
I'll be back tomorrow night.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.831
We'll talk then.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.512
Sir, I have Roberts on the secure line.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.274
Turns out Milton Fine
isn't who we think he is.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.309
Oh, thank God you're fully clothed.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.517
I was afraid I'd be walking in
on some sort of dangerous liaison.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.999
I take it you talked to Lana.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.469
I could barely hear her
through the sobs, but yeah.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.950
She called to tell me that she was
spending the night at Aunt Nell's.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.030
So where's the hottie?

16:50.840 --> 16:54.310
If you're talking about Simone,
she's in the house.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.278
I don't get it.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.079
I mean, if it was Red K,
you wouldn't be doing chores.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.879
If it was Silver K, you'd be afraid that
that pitchfork...

17:03.040 --> 17:05.031
...was gonna turn you
into a shish kebab.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.034
What happened to you, Clark?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.477
I fell in love.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.912
I don't think you fell.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.559
I think you were pushed...

17:15.720 --> 17:16.993
...off a cliff.

17:17.960 --> 17:22.032
Chloe, just because you know my secret,
doesn't mean you know how I feel.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.556
Yeah, but I do know that you'd never
intentionally hurt Lana like this.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.758
You said my relationship with Lana
would never go anywhere...

17:29.920 --> 17:32.957
...as long as I have to lie about
who I am. And you were right.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.918
So how are things gonna be
any different with Simone?

17:36.280 --> 17:39.192
I told Simone about my powers.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.790
Wait a minute, Clark. You may think
you're madly in love with this <i>girl...</i>

17:43.960 --> 17:46.520
...but you need to stay away.
- You don't even know her.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.229
No, but I know you well enough
to know when you're being manipulated.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.589
You're crossing a line here.
I've always trusted you.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.594
So how about this time,
you trust me? Let me live my life.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.238
Back off.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.435
- Clark, is that you?
- Hi, you must be Simone.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.435
I'm... I'm chloe. I'm clark's friend.
It's really great to finally meet you.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.432
Hello.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.231
I'm so glad that clark
hooked up with you.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.311
I mean, he was just
miserable with Lana...

18:42.480 --> 18:45.756
...and now, I honestly have never
seen him more happy.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.480
You two are really
perfect for each other.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.558
That's nice to hear.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.996
- Do you know where he is?
- Yeah, he's in the barn.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.158
Clark, I need you.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.639
Clark?

20:00.800 --> 20:04.713
I would have had tea and petits fours
waiting, but I didn't expect you so soon.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.159
You knew I was coming.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.515
You leave a trail of breadcrumbs,
no surprise when the crow comes calling.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.910
I think a simple phone call
would have sufficed.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.359
I couldn't reveal the truth
about myself until I was sure...

20:18.520 --> 20:23.275
...you were dedicated to your cause.
- Well, I hate to disappoint you...

20:24.400 --> 20:26.675
...but I already know what you are.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.309
And it's not
a professor of history, is it?

20:33.680 --> 20:36.990
No, it's something
much more exciting.

20:37.160 --> 20:41.233
Tell me, what's the benefits package
of a government operative...

20:41.400 --> 20:44.198
...working for a covert branch
of the State Department?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.831
Very good.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.559
You found that breadcrumb
on your own.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.592
I want to know
what you were doing...

20:57.760 --> 21:01.275
...posing as a college professor
in a Kansas farm town.

21:02.320 --> 21:07.440
I was investigating the possibility
of an extraterrestrial presence.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.712
This investigation...

21:12.880 --> 21:14.791
...did it bear any fruit?

21:14.960 --> 21:18.350
Well, we believe a spacecraft
of unknown origin...

21:18.520 --> 21:21.432
...touched down during
the recent meteor shower.

21:21.840 --> 21:26.038
But an individual
with quick reflexes and vast resources...

21:26.200 --> 21:29.158
...was able to get to it
before we could.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.830
So that's why you were
investigating LuthorCorp.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.479
Yeah.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.594
And I admire the remarkable advances
you've made in the name of science.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.797
Too bad you couldn't get into
that ship when you had a chance.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.633
You know where it is.

21:50.680 --> 21:55.356
The ancient Mayans believed they were
visited by great beings from the heavens.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.431
You think the ship's in Honduras.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.354
Well, I'm certainly
not here for the coffee.

22:11.680 --> 22:16.037
So I think clark's bizarre behavior might
be some form of supercharged hypnosis.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.510
I've heard of hypnotism being used
to stop smoking or lose weight...

22:19.680 --> 22:22.274
...but to reduce Clark to some
goo-goo-eyed love slave?

22:22.440 --> 22:25.113
This isn't over-the-counter hypnosis,
it's prescription strength.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.840
And it never wears off.
Check this out.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.555
Simone's dad was world-renowned
for curing his patients of all inflictions...

22:31.720 --> 22:33.756
...everything from cravings to cancer.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.156
Maybe I can talk to him
about my nail-biting.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.635
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.516
Last month he died
during a botched burglary.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.918
Wait a second, I've seen that jewel.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.429
So have I, around Simone's
scrawny little neck.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.875
It's an ancient family heirloom
that dates back...

22:53.040 --> 22:54.951
...to the alchemists
in medieval England.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.429
It was also the only thing stolen.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.592
Are you saying Simone's responsible
for her own father's death?

23:00.920 --> 23:05.675
I don't know. If it meant getting
daddy's hyper-hypno powers, maybe.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.799
I just think it's a tad bit cocky to be
wearing it around your neck like a medal.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.799
Not if you can make any cop
believe that you're innocent.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.793
What I don't understand is,
of all people, why go after Clark?

23:15.960 --> 23:17.393
I don't know.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.278
We need to snap him
out of it soon...

23:19.440 --> 23:22.512
...before he does something
he can't ever come back from.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.433
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's move.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.428
Yeah, you know, l...
I just need to grab something.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.068
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.999
His father carved it.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.955
After claiming to have seen
a <i>carroza de los dioses</i> land from the sky.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.158
- Chariot of the gods.
- Yeah.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.191
I wanna talk to him.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.113
I know you can do many things...

24:23.280 --> 24:25.794
<i>...but</i> I'm not sure
you can communicate with the dead.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.396
Days after the sighting, his wife
came home to find his charred remains.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.795
Despite urban myths...

24:35.120 --> 24:37.554
...human beings
don't spontaneously combust.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.755
No.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.556
We believe whoever or whatever was
in that spaceship incinerated the man.

24:43.720 --> 24:48.669
In fact, we suspect this alien race
poses a grave threat to the entire planet.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.718
Well, how do you defend against
a threat of that magnitude?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.959
It presents a great challenge.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.192
We are working on
a potential weapon...

24:57.400 --> 25:01.109
...a weapon that would greatly benefit
from Luthorcorp's assistance.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.876
We're well aware of your tireless quest
for extraterrestrial life.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.359
Your tenacity is impressive.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.159
I'll help in any way I <i>can...</i>

25:09.320 --> 25:11.675
...but I want unrestricted access
to all your data.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.389
- That's a bold request.
- Well, without it, this discussion is over.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.471
I'm not sure
you understand me, Mr. Luthor.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.359
If we don't work together,
there may not be a LuthorCorp...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.556
...or a government left.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.638
Think about that on your flight home.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.719
Where you off to, Romeo?

25:37.880 --> 25:41.316
- A motel with vibrating beds?
- Simone and I are going to California.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.516
That way I can get away
from your commentary.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.513
My running commentary says
you're hypnotized.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.274
You need to drop your suitcase
because you're not going.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.710
I'm asking you nicely, step aside.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.791
Look, I didn't wanna have to do <i>this...</i>

25:53.960 --> 25:57.430
...but if necessary,
I'm gonna have to take you down.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.315
I see we have a visitor.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.590
I suggest you turn your boy toy
back to normal...

26:07.760 --> 26:10.752
...before I reach over and rip out
those pearly white teeth.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.114
- Clark, be a love and knock her out.
- Yeah, right.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.029
Oh, my God. What happened?

26:23.560 --> 26:29.351
Mrs. Kent, I want you to do whatever
it takes to stop her from following us.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.788
Where are you off to?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.991
We're leaving Smallville forever.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.197
And you couldn't be more thrilled.
You won't miss clark one bit.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.879
Well then, you two
have a wonderful time.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.877
Thanks, Mom.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.918
- We better go.
- Okay. Bye.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.430
Oh, and we have to make one quick
pit stop at the Luthor mansion.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.273
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you need.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.278
Clark, you're gonna kill Lex Luthor.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.071
He's a dead man.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.195
Mrs. Kent, what are you doing?

27:31.720 --> 27:34.280
Stay right where you are.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.074
Look, you're not <i>yourself...</i>

27:37.240 --> 27:41.392
<i>...so</i> why don't you quit
the Calamity Jane impersonation...

27:41.640 --> 27:42.755
...and drop the weapon.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.190
I don't like it
any more than you do, Lois...

27:45.360 --> 27:47.271
<i>...but</i> it's the only way
to keep you here.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.951
Oh, my God,
I just knocked out Martha Kent.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.476
Hello? The woman was about
to wallpaper her living room...

27:58.640 --> 28:01.996
...with my brain matter.
- Right. Where's clark?

28:02.200 --> 28:05.510
Well, while I was seeing stars,
I think his girlfriend...

28:05.720 --> 28:08.837
...said she wanted to go
to the Luthor mansion or something.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.231
So why don't you stay here
and keep Mrs. Kent...

28:17.120 --> 28:18.519
Mrs. Kent?

28:23.960 --> 28:27.236
Well, it's always nice to be
welcomed home after a trip...

28:27.400 --> 28:29.231
<i>...but</i> I didn't expect to find you here.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.112
Clark, you've been hypnotized.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.355
How else could you throw me
across a room?

28:41.560 --> 28:44.472
- I'm done with you, Lex.
- You're under Simone's control now.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.275
The girl's a cold-blooded
murderer, Clark.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.158
Your lies can't help you now.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.510
Clark, before she wore that jewel,
she was nothing but a petty shoplifter.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.513
Her dad never trusted her with the gem,
so she murdered him.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.154
I have the whole thing
on surveillance tape.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.790
You don't believe
a word he said, Clark.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.718
My security's on the way.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.751
Oh, I've met your security team.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.798
I hope you don't mind,
I gave them all the day off.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.954
Finish him off, Clark...

29:14.960 --> 29:16.279
...and make him suffer.

29:32.120 --> 29:36.796
- I'm sorry, clark.
- No. Chloe, no.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.110
Lex! Kill her...

29:50.240 --> 29:51.639
...and then kill yourself.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.071
Are you all right, Clark?

30:24.360 --> 30:26.271
I think so.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.797
I feel like I woke up
from a bad dream...

30:35.960 --> 30:37.678
...except I remember all the details.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.799
Yeah. Did you and Simone
ever actually...?

30:41.960 --> 30:44.713
- No. Thank God.
- Okay.

30:44.880 --> 30:48.270
The moral of the story is never gaze
into the eyes of a seductive woman...

30:48.440 --> 30:50.237
...wearing a gemstone
around her neck...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.834
...unless, of course,
her name is Lana Lang.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.998
Have you talked to her yet?
You guys kiss and make up?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.750
- You haven't talked to her, have you?
- No.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.192
What are you waiting for?

31:04.360 --> 31:06.271
I mean, she knows
that you were hypnotized.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.351
Every single one of us
has gone through...

31:08.520 --> 31:10.715
...some sort of an identity crisis
at one point.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.950
It's like a rite of passage in Smallville.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.031
She'll understand.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.873
Maybe I don't want her to understand.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.956
See, as horrible as all this was...

31:21.120 --> 31:24.430
...it did accomplish one thing
that I didn't have the guts to do myself.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.672
It broke me and Lana up.

31:28.360 --> 31:32.592
What? Wait a minute.
Are you still hypno'd?

31:32.760 --> 31:35.957
Chloe, how many times can I break
someone's heart before it crumbles?

31:36.120 --> 31:37.553
Yeah, but it wasn't your fault.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.109
- You were hypnotized.
- Lana wasn't.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.231
Chloe, her feelings were real.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.109
The look of pain in her eye
when she walked in on Simone and I...

31:47.560 --> 31:50.358
...it made me realize that
my power to hurt Lana...

31:50.520 --> 31:53.353
...is stronger than all my powers
put together.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.996
Meeting a girl with hocus-pocus jewelry
isn't an everyday occurrence.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.997
Yeah, but hurting Lana
has become one.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.675
And as long as I have to lie to her about
who I am, I'm gonna cause her pain.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.116
And as long as you don't set the record
straight, she's gonna hate you.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.828
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.874
Maybe it'll help her move on,
forget I ever existed...

32:15.080 --> 32:18.072
...and find someone who can
give her what she deserves.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.275
You just need to know
that if you do this...

32:23.440 --> 32:26.273
...that's it, game over,
there's no more quarters left.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.396
I mean, you're saying
goodbye forever.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.716
It will crush her, Clark.

32:30.920 --> 32:35.710
Please just think long and hard
before you end this for good.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.630
I've climbed these stairs
so many times before...

32:58.800 --> 33:00.677
...why do they seem steeper
than ever?

33:01.160 --> 33:03.515
Thanks for coming,
I didn't wanna bother you at school.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.797
Clark, you can spare me the speech
about how sorry you are.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.279
I know you were hypnotized...

33:08.440 --> 33:11.113
<i>...and</i> I know that you weren't in control
of your actions.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.992
I need to be honest with you.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.836
That would be refreshing.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.553
I don't know any other way to say <i>it...</i>

33:25.840 --> 33:28.035
...but the truth is...

33:28.800 --> 33:30.995
...my feelings for you have changed.

33:38.680 --> 33:43.435
Clark, I want you
to look me in the eye...

33:43.760 --> 33:45.990
<i>...and</i> tell me that you don't love me.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.038
I don't love you.

34:14.600 --> 34:18.036
I have waited for you to grow up...

34:18.199 --> 34:20.873
...to get over whatever
hang-ups you may have.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.234
I never meant to hurt you.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.159
I don't want another
Clark Kent apology.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.272
It's over.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.552
Forever.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.672
We need more samples.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.950
How did she take it?

36:16.680 --> 36:19.069
I've never seen her so <i>hurt...</i>

36:19.240 --> 36:21.276
...so angry.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.713
Saying those words was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.354
You're an adult now, <i>clark...</i>

36:31.600 --> 36:33.716
...in an adult relationship...

36:33.880 --> 36:36.633
...and they rarely end
the way we want them to.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.638
You know, I just didn't know
what else to do.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.948
It was either make a clean break...

36:45.280 --> 36:48.113
...or tell her my secret.
- Yeah.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.112
I know you didn't tell Lana the truth
because you wanted to protect her...

36:54.360 --> 36:58.273
...but maybe there was
actually more to it.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.432
What do you mean?

37:06.240 --> 37:11.872
Do you think you didn't tell her
because maybe deep down...

37:12.440 --> 37:15.273
<i>...you</i> didn't think she was the one?

37:22.280 --> 37:25.795
- Mom, I'll always love Lana.
- I know.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.270
That's why you did this.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.596
But you didn't just
break her heart, Clark...

37:30.760 --> 37:32.796
...you gave her reason to hate you.

37:34.680 --> 37:39.470
I just hope her anger doesn't drive her
to do something we'll all regret.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.315
Oh, just the woman I wanted to see.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.438
So it turns out everybody's
favorite academic, Milton Fine...

38:02.600 --> 38:03.874
...isn't a professor at all.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.713
Lex, I'm not here
to talk about Milton Fine.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.678
I actually wanted you
to be the first to know.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.071
Is everything okay?

38:15.520 --> 38:17.750
Clark and I broke up.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.232
For real.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.517
- Lana, I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. Don't be.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.478
I actually do feel like
a hundred tons of secrets and lies...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.358
...have been lifted off my shoulders.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.829
You know what it's like
