WEBVTT

02:09.210 --> 02:11.110
Harper?!

02:17.610 --> 02:19.810
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:19.810 --> 02:21.710
This dude is so crazy!

02:21.710 --> 02:23.310
I don't
understand why they're acting

02:23.310 --> 02:24.710
like this is not a problem.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.040
I mean, it's bullshit.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.780
He's a complete asshole to her.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.310
She deserves so much better.
She doesn't want a stalker.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.980
She already has a stalker.

02:32.980 --> 02:36.540
<i>Aaah! No! Aah!</i>

02:36.550 --> 02:39.180
<i>Johnny! Help me!</i>

02:47.450 --> 02:49.610
Yeah?

02:54.210 --> 02:55.780
Hey.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.940
Did your boyfriend just
throw a pumpkin at our door?

02:58.950 --> 03:01.380
What?

03:01.380 --> 03:03.440
That's not something he'd do.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.710
No, no, no. That's bullshit.

03:05.710 --> 03:07.480
Bailey.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.980
No, you are breaking up
with this bitch tonight, okay?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.440
Don't!

03:11.450 --> 03:13.040
Bailey, stop!

03:14.980 --> 03:16.510
Everything's fine.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.280
He's an alcoholic, Harper.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.010
You want to know how I can tell?

03:21.010 --> 03:24.510
Because he's an alcoholic.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.210
Look, all I'm saying is that
I came into your room last night

03:27.210 --> 03:29.610
to steal some jewelry
for my Halloween costume,

03:29.610 --> 03:30.940
and you were passed out.

03:30.950 --> 03:34.110
Careful. That's my mom's.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.780
Harper, you had a bruise
on your face.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.680
Do you see a bruise?

03:47.680 --> 03:49.710
There's minor swelling,
indicating a contusion

03:49.710 --> 03:51.880
on the orbital plate.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.440
You should come out
with us, though...

03:53.450 --> 03:57.140
Get your mind off
of the boyfriend drama.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.980
I don't have a costume.
It would be weird.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.880
It's Halloween.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.040
Weird is good.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.440
<i>Then he grabbed me!</i>

04:15.450 --> 04:19.709
<i>He grabbed me,
and he ripped at me!</i>

04:19.709 --> 04:23.540
<i>He held me, and he ripped
at my clothes!</i>

04:23.550 --> 04:25.680
<i>Just calm down.</i>

04:25.680 --> 04:30.380
<i>Oh! I screamed, "Johnny!
Johnny, help me!"</i>

04:34.650 --> 04:36.040
Delish!

04:36.050 --> 04:38.280
What kind of hooch
are we bootleggin'?

04:38.280 --> 04:40.640
Spider vodka.

04:40.650 --> 04:42.480
Fuck off. No, really.
It's from Thailand.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.880
They put a ceremonial spider
in every bottle.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.440
You don't want to touch it?

04:45.450 --> 04:46.940
Nope. I know it's Halloween.
I'm not doing that.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.540
Seriously? You're still
afraid of spiders?

04:48.550 --> 04:49.840
Yeah.

04:49.850 --> 04:52.380
Ladies, say, "Happy Ho-lloween!"

04:52.380 --> 04:55.180
Happy Ho-lloween!

04:55.180 --> 04:56.780
Oh, my God. Nathan!

04:59.450 --> 05:00.510
Nathan!

05:00.510 --> 05:02.040
Hey. What's up?

05:02.050 --> 05:03.340
How are you?
Surprised you found me.

05:03.350 --> 05:04.540
This place is crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.510
Ty Hoffman!

05:08.050 --> 05:10.810
Bitch, what's up? How are you?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.340
Hey.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.110
Hey.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.980
Did you need something?

05:43.980 --> 05:45.810
What?

05:45.810 --> 05:47.280
Oh. You were just
talking to my friend,

05:47.280 --> 05:49.040
and then you waved me over.

05:49.050 --> 05:52.110
Oh. No, I'm sorry.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.710
I was motioning
for another drink.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.980
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.840
I'm so sorry. Uh...

05:58.850 --> 06:00.380
No, it's cool. So, wait.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.640
Do you... Do you know Bailey?

06:01.650 --> 06:03.780
Yeah. Yeah,
we met freshman year.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.810
Are you one of her
yoga students?

06:06.810 --> 06:08.110
No. No?

06:08.110 --> 06:09.940
I'm her roommate... Harper.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.340
Oh, yeah, no. Yeah.
I've totally heard about you.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.710
Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?

06:15.050 --> 06:18.340
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween!

06:18.350 --> 06:21.180
That scare you? Yes.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.140
Yeah, well, um, I'm surprised
we haven't met before.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.110
I don't get out much.

06:26.110 --> 06:29.110
I don't really
get out much, either.

06:29.110 --> 06:30.610
Someone literally reminded me
it was Halloween

06:30.610 --> 06:32.180
like 15 minutes ago,

06:32.180 --> 06:35.440
so I just rolled out of bed
and grabbed my lucky bat.

06:35.450 --> 06:37.210
I kind of hate these things.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.280
Yeah, well, at least
you have a costume.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.610
What are you talking about?
You have a costume.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.880
If... If you don't mind,
you can do that and...

06:44.880 --> 06:47.210
Boom, look...
Little Red Riding Hood.

06:47.210 --> 06:50.280
- Bullshit!
- Evan.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.710
I'm sick of this shit!

06:51.710 --> 06:54.310
What the fuck
are you doing, dude?

06:54.310 --> 06:57.140
I'm so sorry about that.
Fuck this shit show.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.310
What the fuck are you
supposed to be, anyways?

06:59.310 --> 07:01.640
What do you mean, what the fuck
am I supposed to be?

07:01.650 --> 07:03.210
I'm the front half
of a human centipede.

07:03.210 --> 07:05.040
The other two dudes just bailed,

07:05.050 --> 07:07.140
so now I'm walking around,
looking like a fucking jackass.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.140
Oh, now you look like a jackass?

07:09.150 --> 07:11.640
Did they bail 'cause they didn't
want to eat ass all night?

07:11.650 --> 07:13.210
No.

07:13.210 --> 07:15.040
They probably bailed
'cause this bar sucks dick.

07:15.050 --> 07:17.940
I think they were just fucking
with you, dude.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.680
Oberhaus and K.C. are
right over there

07:19.680 --> 07:21.980
with the rest of the team.
Motherfuckers.

07:21.980 --> 07:25.380
No one wants to be the ass end
of a human centipede.

08:07.550 --> 08:11.280
Hey.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.010
Saw you headed towards the exit.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.910
I was getting worried you left.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.510
The team awarded me
worst costume.

08:19.510 --> 08:24.310
Figured I'd share it with the runner-up.

08:24.310 --> 08:27.540
I didn't know you were
still on the team.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.210
Took a wild pitch
to the face last season.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.940
Shattered my cheekbone
in three places.

08:31.950 --> 08:33.440
Now I'm riding the bench.

08:33.450 --> 08:35.440
Well, you can't really tell.

08:35.450 --> 08:36.809
What about you?

08:36.809 --> 08:38.539
What?

08:38.549 --> 08:41.010
Nothing scary ever
happened to you?

08:41.010 --> 08:42.309
I mean, Halloween, right?

08:42.309 --> 08:43.710
Scary stories,
that's what you do...

08:43.710 --> 08:47.210
Tell each other scary stories.

08:47.210 --> 08:52.710
Uh...
like, wh-what, about my life?

08:52.710 --> 08:54.940
Yeah. Nothing scary
ever happened to you?

08:54.950 --> 08:56.480
I-I don't know.

08:56.480 --> 09:01.810
I mean, I-I had a really
great childhood.

09:01.810 --> 09:06.280
Um, have a great relationship
with my parents.

09:08.350 --> 09:12.140
Well, I <i> had</i> a great
relationship with them.

09:12.150 --> 09:15.040
I don't talk to
my parents much, either.

09:23.650 --> 09:27.210
I think I should go.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.440
I think you should stay.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.110
Wait. Where are we going next?

09:34.110 --> 09:35.680
- The haunted corn maze is open late.
- No.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.180
Yes! I know the cast!

09:37.180 --> 09:39.010
No, that place is a breeding
ground for parasites.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.340
My cousin Kim...
She's a health inspector,

09:40.350 --> 09:42.110
and she gave it a "D."

09:42.110 --> 09:43.940
Why don't we, uh, hit up
the food trucks on campus,

09:43.950 --> 09:45.380
Netflix a scary movie, yeah?

09:45.380 --> 09:46.610
- Dude, I could eat.
- I'm hungry, too.

09:46.610 --> 09:48.610
Yo, yo, yo, guys, guys, guys!

09:48.610 --> 09:50.180
Or...

09:50.180 --> 09:51.610
we could go to
an extreme haunted house.

09:51.610 --> 09:52.510
- Yes.
- Haunted house.

09:52.510 --> 09:53.880
- Yes.
- No!

09:53.880 --> 09:55.980
- I don't want to do that.
- Let's do it.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.540
Well, there's at least
five haunts in the area.

09:57.550 --> 09:59.710
Somebody pick so we can call
this shit a night.

09:59.710 --> 10:01.680
There we go.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.110
Wait. Evan, what are you doing?

10:03.110 --> 10:04.880
I'm paying my tuition.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.640
Hey, guys, water? Anybody?

10:06.650 --> 10:07.540
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

10:07.550 --> 10:08.510
Got mints here.

10:08.510 --> 10:09.510
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:09.510 --> 10:11.280
What is this?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.540
Uh, that would be Dasani, flat,
and Altoids cinnamons.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.280
Yeah, no. If you think we're
actually gonna pay you

10:15.280 --> 10:17.280
to drive us to a haunted house
that you wanted to go to...

10:17.280 --> 10:19.040
I'm a professional
in the rideshare business.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.340
I can't just give you a free
ride because you're my buddies.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.440
Oh, well. It's not fair
to the paying customers.

10:23.450 --> 10:24.680
I'm all about fairness.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.810
Always have been.
You have to be.

10:25.810 --> 10:28.710
5-star-rated, baby!

10:28.710 --> 10:30.110
I'm glad you understand.
What are you doing?

10:30.110 --> 10:32.410
No! Hey! What the fuck, dude?!

10:38.980 --> 10:40.510
Okay, guys.

10:40.510 --> 10:43.710
There's a Jaycees
that's just past the mill.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.940
We are not going to Jaycees. No.

10:45.950 --> 10:47.810
We just do it a lot. That's all.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.380
Too much settling.
Okay. Just find one.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.240
I'll find another one.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.810
Hey, Evan,
can you turn up there?

10:58.810 --> 11:00.780
- Huh?
- Turn up there.

11:00.780 --> 11:03.040
Yeah.

11:03.050 --> 11:04.340
Whoa, wait. Where are we going?

11:04.350 --> 11:06.010
Yeah, Harper,
where are we going?

11:13.110 --> 11:15.280
Is someone following us?

11:15.280 --> 11:18.540
Isn't there a haunted
house at the hospital tonight?

11:18.550 --> 11:20.840
Yeah, there is, but
I really don't want to show

11:20.850 --> 11:22.960
my face there with my grades
looking the way they are.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.780
Evan, what's going on?

11:30.780 --> 11:33.980
Harper thinks
we're being stalked.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.040
No, it's just...

11:36.050 --> 11:39.210
did anyone see that truck
follow us back from the bar?

11:59.210 --> 12:01.980
This cannot be ignored.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.940
Oh, this looks like
the haunt from Evan's flyer.

12:28.950 --> 12:31.210
Evan, if this sucks,
it's on you.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.810
Guys, I love you all,
but I'm over it.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.940
I got to fix my car
in the morning.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.840
Fuck your car!
This is the bee's knees!

12:38.850 --> 12:41.510
Guys, there's only
one review on Yelp.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.980
Oh, but it says the proceeds go
to Red Cross, so that's cool.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.710
You know what? I'm with Bailey.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.940
I think it's getting
kind of late.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.440
We should probably just...

12:50.450 --> 12:53.540
Harper, you promised
to have a fun night.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.140
I hate it when I make promises.

12:59.150 --> 13:02.040
- Oh, my head!
- Where's Evan?

13:02.050 --> 13:03.480
Wait. Hold up.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.210
- Thanks.
- Evan!

13:05.210 --> 13:08.440
I'm comin' for ya.
I'm comin' for ya.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.010
Rah!

13:13.710 --> 13:14.540
Oh.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.980
- Yazzah?
- Yazzah!

13:17.980 --> 13:19.780
Ooh, Evan's afraid of clowns.

13:19.780 --> 13:22.210
- Oh, hello, clown!
- Hello.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.510
Hello, Mr. Clown.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.240
Can we have six tickets, please?

13:36.380 --> 13:38.310
No? Okay.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.010
- That's a good try.
- Excuse me.

13:40.010 --> 13:43.240
We'd like to enter your
shady-ass establishment, please.

13:44.710 --> 13:45.840
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.640
- Okay.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.940
This is scary.

13:52.050 --> 13:53.510
Okay. Bailey, after you?

13:53.510 --> 13:55.610
This is a Bailey job.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.540
Okay. It's obviously
not in that hand.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.540
Pick the other hand.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.980
- Ooh.
- It's a key. It's a key.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.340
Five stars for this place
with the creepy-ass clown

14:47.350 --> 14:49.340
doing shitty-ass magic.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.440
So, like, do you do
birthdays and shit, too?

14:54.440 --> 14:58.440
Is this like a seasonal gig
for you?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.340
I got a niece who loves
scary fucking clowns,

15:00.350 --> 15:03.840
so I'm looking to acquire
your services.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.380
I'll get a card before we leave.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.710
You can pull it out of
wherever you want to.

15:07.710 --> 15:11.280
- What is it?
- Liability waiver.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.310
It says, "Haunted house rules."

15:13.310 --> 15:15.710
Rule number one... stay on
the marked path at all times.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.040
"Rule number two...
Never touch the actors."

15:18.050 --> 15:20.340
No promises.
"Rule number three..."

15:20.350 --> 15:23.840
You will be prompted
to do certain actions.

15:23.850 --> 15:25.680
Please do exactly
as you are told.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.040
This is for your safety.

15:28.050 --> 15:29.880
Rule number four...
All cellphones

15:29.880 --> 15:31.940
must be surrendered
to the lock box before entering.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.840
You may keep the lock box key

15:33.850 --> 15:35.340
"until you return
from the attraction."

15:35.350 --> 15:38.040
Are you kidding me? What?

15:38.050 --> 15:40.340
No, I just think that's probably
gonna be the scariest part for you...

15:40.350 --> 15:42.210
Not having your phone on you
at all times.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.180
Guys, we're basically signing
our lives away to this thing.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.340
- I don't think it's...
- Yes!

15:50.710 --> 15:53.680
Yes. Yes. We're doing this. Yes.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.440
Okay.

16:02.510 --> 16:06.780
All righty. Let's go.

16:19.950 --> 16:23.640
Okay.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.110
- Ooh.
- This is a little... lame.

16:27.110 --> 16:28.480
Yeah. Okay.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.340
Is this supposed to be scary?

16:30.340 --> 16:31.810
The only thing that would
scare Bailey

16:31.810 --> 16:33.140
is if they defunded
Planned Parenthood.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.110
Am I right?

16:35.110 --> 16:36.980
Aah!

16:36.980 --> 16:38.440
Ha, ha, ha. Ho, ho.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.710
Oh, that's what you get.

16:43.710 --> 16:46.240
Uh-oh. I feel like
that's not a good idea.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.810
Whoa!

17:17.810 --> 17:19.010
Wow! This is awesome.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.380
It's getting better.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.510
- There's a wall.
- Yeah, no, I found it.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.180
- I found the wall.
- Yeah.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.010
Yo, guys, guys, guys, guys.

17:30.010 --> 17:33.140
Oh, that's a real guy.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.780
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, yeah.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.240
Oh, my God.

18:03.340 --> 18:04.510
What?

18:04.510 --> 18:07.380
Somebody! Somebody help me!

18:07.380 --> 18:09.380
Help me, please!

18:09.380 --> 18:12.180
Somebody help me!
Please help me!

18:12.180 --> 18:15.980
I don't want to die!
Please, please! Just let me go!

18:15.980 --> 18:18.380
I promise! I promise
I won't tell anybody!

18:18.380 --> 18:19.620
Please! Please, please, please!

18:20.640 --> 18:22.940
Holy shit! Holy shit!

18:25.340 --> 18:27.480
Oh, my God.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.780
- Oh, that was so good.
- That was so good.

18:34.610 --> 18:37.210
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.
- Yeah, nope.

18:37.210 --> 18:41.010
You're going first.
You are going first. Yep.

18:41.010 --> 18:43.980
- That's some sick-ass shit.
- That was crazy.

18:45.380 --> 18:48.240
- Oh.
- "Bye."

18:50.510 --> 18:51.810
Ooh.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.980
Safe or not safe?

18:53.980 --> 18:55.710
- I got dibs on not safe.
- Not safe!

18:55.710 --> 18:57.710
- Of course.
- Okay.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.810
Well, then, we will go this way.

18:59.810 --> 19:01.210
You guys can go that way.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.110
Oh, no.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.210
- I fucking hate spiders!
- Go.

19:14.210 --> 19:15.510
- Come on.
- No.

19:15.510 --> 19:17.980
Come on.

19:17.980 --> 19:21.610
Watch your head.

19:21.610 --> 19:22.840
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
- What is that?

19:22.850 --> 19:25.140
- Oh, my God.
- What the heck?

19:25.150 --> 19:26.680
- No, no, no!
- Aah!

19:26.680 --> 19:30.780
Oh, shit. There's, like,
real spiders in here.

19:31.850 --> 19:34.810
Oh, my God.

19:34.810 --> 19:37.510
You guys.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.710
Guys.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.180
Look.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.440
Nice.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.940
Wait, Nathan.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.880
What is that? I don't know.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.880
Oh. No way. Way to go, guys.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.710
Way to wait till the last minute
to paint the walls.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.340
No, this isn't paint.
This is oil.

20:00.340 --> 20:04.280
Yeah. That's weird.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.640
Why'd they put oil on the walls?

20:06.640 --> 20:10.810
- Maybe it's cheaper.
- Oil's not cheaper than paint.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.410
My cousin Hasib...
He's a petroleum engineer.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.810
Okay.
Where are we supposed to go?

20:25.810 --> 20:27.280
Maybe it's a puzzle?

20:27.280 --> 20:29.580
That's weird.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.310
I don't know.

20:54.050 --> 20:57.010
Did you hear that?

20:57.010 --> 21:00.880
It sounded like a door.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.610
How do we open it?

21:04.610 --> 21:07.810
It must only open
if the coffin's closed.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.680
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.810
If I don't return,
speak highly of me.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.340
Yo, guys!

21:31.340 --> 21:33.410
It worked!

21:36.440 --> 21:38.280
I really don't like
small spaces.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.410
Then just get it over with,
sweet cheeks.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.540
Mallory, I'm through!

21:53.540 --> 21:55.440
Okay.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.740
Coming.

22:10.540 --> 22:11.980
Guys?

22:17.340 --> 22:20.040
Guys, it's not...

22:35.310 --> 22:37.540
Oh. No! No!

22:37.540 --> 22:39.280
Oh, my God! Spiders!

22:39.280 --> 22:41.880
Hold on! It's gonna open.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.340
Oh, my God!

22:43.340 --> 22:45.610
I had spiders all over! Mallory.

22:45.610 --> 22:47.710
Mallory, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at me.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.010
Look at me.
Look, look right here.

22:49.010 --> 22:52.280
"Skeletons, masks, spiders."

22:52.280 --> 22:53.980
Cheap motherfuckers bought
this shit at Party City

22:53.980 --> 22:55.210
like two days ago.

22:55.210 --> 22:57.680
Look. It's fake.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.940
Fuck spiders.

23:03.510 --> 23:05.510
Nope.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.840
I'm not going in there.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.110
This way.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.980
Who's first?

23:16.980 --> 23:19.440
Look at my face!

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
This is trippy.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.280
Angela, look at this.
This is amazing.

23:25.310 --> 23:27.040
Whoaaa.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.640
That's so weird!

23:29.640 --> 23:33.440
Huh. There's no gap
between the reflection.

23:33.440 --> 23:37.280
- So?
- It's a two-way mirror.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.880
My cousin Summer...
She's a criminal psychiatrist.

23:41.610 --> 23:43.910
Cool.

23:46.180 --> 23:49.040
I said I didn't want
to go in the tunnel.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.040
Yeah? Well, Harper, you
should have thought about that

23:51.040 --> 23:53.240
before you got into a tunnel.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.380
Oh, shit. Okay.

23:57.380 --> 24:01.840
Uh, this way's a dead end,
so we got to go back.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.210
Are you kidding? It is way
too tight to turn around.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.010
You're just drunk. Come on.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.680
Shuffle backwards.
We'll find a different way.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.480
I'm gonna have so many splinters
when I get home.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.840
Oh, guys, guys, I found it!

24:14.850 --> 24:17.940
Stay close!
What the fuck does that mean?

24:17.940 --> 24:19.510
It means stay close.

24:19.510 --> 24:23.010
Okay. I'm following.
We're following.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.840
Hey, guys, this way!

24:34.040 --> 24:35.240
What was that?

24:53.510 --> 24:56.040
Who's there?

25:13.980 --> 25:16.440
Wait. Where's Mallory?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.210
- Come on.
- Go ahead.

25:23.210 --> 25:25.540
Pussies.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.640
Oh, my God! Get it off me!

25:35.640 --> 25:38.280
What is it? Brains!

25:38.280 --> 25:40.110
Are you serious? Knew it.

25:40.110 --> 25:41.340
Eww. Knew it.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.340
Okay.

25:43.340 --> 25:46.580
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.310
This is stressing me out.

25:57.310 --> 26:02.810
It's not that bad. Okay.
Feels... small...

26:02.810 --> 26:05.110
uh, round...

26:06.340 --> 26:08.880
Ooh. Smooth.

26:08.880 --> 26:13.840
It sounds like you're describing
Evan's scrotum.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.780
That makes sense,
since we have a...

26:15.780 --> 26:17.040
grape.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.380
Do not... Ew!

26:20.380 --> 26:22.840
Let's go.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.180
Okay.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.510
Fine.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.810
I don't... Am I supposed
to be feeling something?

26:42.810 --> 26:45.840
Uh... Push your arm further in.

26:50.210 --> 26:53.010
Yeah, I'm not... This is...
This is not working.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.740
Oh. Let's see.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.040
Okay. No. I give up.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.880
Nothing?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.340
Fuck. My ring.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.840
What ring?
Are you sure you had it on?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.510
Yes, I'm positive.
It was Harper's mother's ring.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.040
She's gonna kill me. Great.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.310
Wait. I think I got it.

27:21.310 --> 27:22.840
You got it?

27:22.840 --> 27:24.180
Oh, no. Damn it!

27:24.180 --> 27:25.940
Oh, shit! No! Damn it!

27:25.940 --> 27:27.310
All right. No. I lost it.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.780
We got to get it.
It's important to her.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.140
We're gonna get it.
We're gonna get it.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.640
Let's, um... All right. Find me.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.340
Do you feel it? Mnh-mnh.

27:33.340 --> 27:34.840
All right.
Let's see if we can find it.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.380
- What?
- What the fuck was that?

27:37.380 --> 27:38.980
- Did you feel that?
- No.

27:38.980 --> 27:40.440
Something just fucking
touched me.

27:40.440 --> 27:44.510
Can you not...
No. Something touched me.

27:44.510 --> 27:45.810
Feel anything?

27:45.810 --> 27:48.510
Someone's back there.

27:48.510 --> 27:49.910
Listen.

27:52.710 --> 27:55.710
Ugh! Ohh!

27:58.810 --> 28:02.310
Oh, God! Oh, no!

28:02.310 --> 28:04.110
Seriously, Nathan, get me
the fuck out of here!

28:04.110 --> 28:06.640
Something's got me!
Ow, my arm! Ow!

28:14.980 --> 28:18.210
Bailey?

28:18.210 --> 28:21.780
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

28:21.780 --> 28:23.780
Mallory!

28:23.780 --> 28:25.540
Can you hear us?

28:30.980 --> 28:33.880
Hey! Follow our voices.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.840
Hey, I hear something.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.380
Mal?

29:01.940 --> 29:06.610
Hey. Um...
Our friend is still in there.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.280
I think he wants us
to keep going.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.380
Okay.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.440
Nice.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.480
I'll go first.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.340
Sure.

30:58.210 --> 30:59.940
Excuse me.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.510
Have you seen our friend?

31:01.510 --> 31:04.280
She's wearing a yellow dress.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.180
Okay.

31:05.180 --> 31:08.010
Okay. Okay.

31:08.010 --> 31:10.540
Whoa! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!

31:10.540 --> 31:11.510
Okay. All right.

31:11.510 --> 31:12.980
All right. Okay.

31:12.980 --> 31:14.940
Okay. Come on. I get it.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.680
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:16.680 --> 31:19.640
Get the fuck outta
my safe space, bro.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.610
What the fuck is wrong with you?

31:32.110 --> 31:35.540
Probably shouldn't have pushed him.
Yeah.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.680
Wait, wait, wait!
Guys, don't close the door!

31:42.680 --> 31:44.540
- Shit!
- Fuck!

31:44.540 --> 31:47.010
Oh, shit. Bailey, what the
fuck happened to your arm?

31:47.010 --> 31:48.380
It's okay. It doesn't...

31:48.380 --> 31:50.310
- Doesn't hurt anymore.
- What's going on?

31:50.310 --> 31:53.040
Guys, where's, um...
Where's Mallory?

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
Are we trapped?

32:13.710 --> 32:16.340
Um... hello.

32:16.340 --> 32:17.810
Hey. Hey. Excuse me.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.440
Hey, excuse me.
Our friend is hurt in here,

32:19.440 --> 32:21.810
and we need your help.

32:21.810 --> 32:24.180
Hey, excuse me. We... We...
We have someone hurt in here.

32:24.180 --> 32:25.510
Excuse me, ma'am?

32:25.510 --> 32:27.140
- Hey.
- Ma'am?

32:27.140 --> 32:29.110
Hey, ma'am, please,
we actually need your help.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.110
Someone's fucking around here.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.610
- Mallory?
- What's going on?

32:32.610 --> 32:35.340
- Mallory, what are you doing?
- Mallory!

32:35.340 --> 32:36.780
- Mallory!
- Mal!

32:36.780 --> 32:39.840
Mallory, wake up!
Mallory, wake up!

33:14.210 --> 33:16.210
Oh, my God!

33:16.210 --> 33:19.640
Is she just acting?

33:19.640 --> 33:21.040
Oh, my God.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.680
What's happening?
What's happening?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.510
- I want to go.
- Okay.

33:37.510 --> 33:40.980
We need, um... We need a phone.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.180
They're all in
the fucking lock box.

33:43.180 --> 33:47.440
Oh. We need... We need...
We need the key.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.370
Who has the key?

33:49.380 --> 33:51.540
Please tell me Mallory
didn't have the fucking key.

33:51.540 --> 33:55.370
Nathan.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.510
Thank you, Bailey.

33:57.510 --> 34:00.280
Hey, what are we gonna do?

34:00.280 --> 34:02.880
We get to the lock box,
and we get our phones.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.640
We can't go back
the same way we came.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.940
I saw an exit.

34:07.940 --> 34:09.639
Where?

34:09.639 --> 34:12.679
Back that way.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.179
What kind of exit?

34:14.179 --> 34:16.940
Like an emergency exit.

34:16.940 --> 34:18.510
Come here.

34:18.510 --> 34:21.210
Hey, buddy, can you...
Can you do this?

34:21.210 --> 34:22.310
Can you get that?

34:22.310 --> 34:25.880
Um, yeah. I-I... Hairpins.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.010
Hair... An-Angela.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.510
Okay. We have three.
We have three.

34:39.780 --> 34:42.139
Come on. Come on.

34:51.610 --> 34:53.040
It's a two-way lock.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.469
What happened to
"I can lock-pick anything"?

34:54.480 --> 34:56.679
Yeah, I meant like anything
like a locker.

34:56.679 --> 34:57.940
I'm an equipment manager.

34:57.940 --> 34:59.140
I'm not Robert De Niro
from "Heat."

34:59.140 --> 35:00.540
Okay. Hey, we just need you

35:00.540 --> 35:01.880
to get through
the fucking lock, okay?

35:01.880 --> 35:04.210
All right. Um...

35:06.180 --> 35:08.010
So, what if we just went
a little bit further?

35:08.010 --> 35:09.510
No, dude. No, listen. Listen.

35:09.510 --> 35:12.110
I don't mean all of us.
You know, just you and me.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.540
We go a little bit further,
and, uh, you know,

35:15.540 --> 35:18.470
we find something like a...
Like a crowbar, you know,

35:18.480 --> 35:21.710
so we can break off the hinges.

35:21.710 --> 35:24.340
Okay. Fuck. I'll go.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.110
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.

35:26.110 --> 35:33.340
I'm gonna go. Just...
Just... Okay.

36:00.510 --> 36:04.540
They have everything...
Our addresses,

36:04.540 --> 36:06.840
our parents' names.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.510
Evan?

36:12.510 --> 36:13.540
Evan, what are you doing?

36:13.540 --> 36:15.010
She's gone.

36:15.010 --> 36:16.440
There must be, like, a trap door

36:16.440 --> 36:18.140
on the other side or something.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.540
No, just leave it.
You don't want to piss them off.

36:20.540 --> 36:21.940
One sec.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.410
Evan, don't.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.170
Hey. Hey, hey.

36:27.180 --> 36:31.270
Come here.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.940
Okay.

36:34.780 --> 36:36.940
Can you reach your arm
through the fence?

36:36.940 --> 36:38.370
What?

36:38.380 --> 36:40.780
There's a metal poker thing
right there.

36:40.780 --> 36:43.680
My arm's too big.
I can't reach it.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.270
So what?

36:45.280 --> 36:48.040
So we can use it to break
the hinges off the door.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.810
Come on.

36:49.810 --> 36:51.840
Okay. Come on.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.510
Okay, okay.

36:53.510 --> 36:55.010
Okay.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.780
Hey!

38:21.780 --> 38:23.310
Hey, please!
Somebody's hurt back here!

38:23.310 --> 38:26.610
Hey!

38:35.010 --> 38:37.240
You say you need help?

38:40.010 --> 38:42.270
Yeah.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.880
Hold on.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.680
I told all my friends
I would come right back.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.980
They're right...
Right back there,

38:55.980 --> 38:57.610
in, um, the room with the fence.

38:57.610 --> 39:00.440
So, do you think you could
come back with me?

39:06.040 --> 39:08.370
Let me get something.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.410
I'm really sorry, Harper.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.340
For what?

39:27.340 --> 39:30.340
I lost your mom's ring.

39:30.340 --> 39:35.680
I was reaching through, and I
lost it in the haunted house.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.940
It's okay.

39:43.010 --> 39:46.370
I grew up in a haunted house.

39:48.710 --> 39:52.610
I loved that house.

39:52.610 --> 39:54.910
I hated it at the same time.

39:58.540 --> 40:02.940
It's where my dad
would read to me...

40:05.540 --> 40:08.070
where he taught me
how to ride a bike.

40:13.810 --> 40:16.070
It's where he hurt my mom.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.840
I would go upstairs to my room,

40:22.840 --> 40:24.780
and I would hide under the bed.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.680
And one day,
while I was hiding, he...

40:34.010 --> 40:36.270
threw my mom across the floor

40:36.280 --> 40:39.840
like it was nothing, like...

40:39.840 --> 40:43.340
that's how it's supposed to be.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.780
I haven't been home
in four years.

40:46.780 --> 40:51.270
But I have
this recurring dream where...

40:51.280 --> 40:55.840
I go back
and knock at the door...

40:57.980 --> 41:00.610
terrified that my dad's
gonna answer.

41:04.010 --> 41:06.340
But my mom comes out.

41:11.110 --> 41:13.270
She tells me he's gone forever.

41:16.780 --> 41:19.840
She tells me the house
isn't haunted anymore.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.440
Come on. You almost
got it. You almost got it.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.870
Oh. I have to take a break.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.870
Okay. It's right there.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.970
It's right there. Okay.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.440
Okay. You good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:32.440 --> 41:35.680
All right.

41:35.680 --> 41:38.370
I have to get my shoulder.
There. There.

41:38.380 --> 41:41.110
All right. A little to the left.
A little bit to the left.

41:41.110 --> 41:42.510
Okay. You're right there.

41:42.510 --> 41:44.140
It's right there.

41:44.140 --> 41:47.040
I feel like my cousin Elina.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.640
She's a proctologist.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.540
How many fucking cousins
do you have?

41:52.540 --> 41:54.470
46.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.940
Okay.

41:55.940 --> 41:58.170
Almost got it.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.780
Got it. I got it.

41:59.780 --> 42:02.610
Okay. Okay.

42:02.610 --> 42:04.810
Com on. You're almost there.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.440
My hand!

42:16.440 --> 42:19.510
What's going on?

42:19.510 --> 42:21.470
Holy shit. Is she bleeding?

42:21.480 --> 42:23.840
Angela?
What happened to your hand?

42:23.840 --> 42:25.440
Oh, we got to get her out.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.010
Yeah, what the fuck's
it look like I'm doing?

42:27.010 --> 42:30.340
I have keys, man.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.110
Where?

42:32.110 --> 42:34.510
I'm sorry, girls. This...
This isn't supposed to happen.

42:34.510 --> 42:38.010
Hey, look, man, we just
want to go, okay?

42:38.010 --> 42:40.640
I don't need to talk
to your manager.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.610
None of us do.

42:42.610 --> 42:44.310
We haven't seen anything.

42:44.310 --> 42:47.270
Nothing happened.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.540
We just want to leave.

42:53.710 --> 42:55.940
We're gonna get out.

43:07.340 --> 43:08.740
Watch out.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.010
The exit was this way.

43:16.780 --> 43:20.440
Over here.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.710
Fuck! I fucking knew it!

43:21.710 --> 43:23.940
Read the door, idiot.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.440
That makes sense.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.340
I didn't remember there being
an exit there.

43:38.340 --> 43:41.470
So, why wouldn't
you say something?!

43:41.480 --> 43:44.770
Why don't we just crawl back
through the tunnel?

43:44.780 --> 43:47.370
Well, if you want to, but you
can only go one at a time.

43:47.380 --> 43:49.170
There's a trap door
in the tunnel

43:49.180 --> 43:51.270
that gets triggered if there's
too many people in there.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.540
Okay, why is there
a trap door in your tunnel?

43:54.540 --> 43:57.140
We use it to capture people
and put them on the show.

43:57.140 --> 43:58.540
There's this whole thing
with a witch...

43:58.540 --> 44:00.810
Yeah. We know about
your fucking show.

44:00.810 --> 44:03.270
One of our friends is dead
because of your fucking show.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.940
She's not dead.

44:04.940 --> 44:06.510
She's outside waiting
on you guys,

44:06.510 --> 44:07.940
probably wondering
what's going on.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.340
What?

44:09.340 --> 44:13.440
Look, we're a little
extreme here,

44:13.440 --> 44:16.010
but safety is a huge priority.

44:16.010 --> 44:17.640
Don't you talk to me
about fucking safety.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.940
Don't you talk to me
about fucking safety!

44:20.940 --> 44:24.370
What's your name?

44:24.380 --> 44:25.440
What's your fucking name?!

44:25.440 --> 44:29.770
Sir, my name's Harper, okay?

44:29.780 --> 44:31.340
We really appreciate your help,

44:31.340 --> 44:35.170
but could you please
just tell us who you are?

44:35.180 --> 44:38.340
You can call me "Mitch."

44:38.340 --> 44:40.610
Thanks, Mitch.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.110
What's your last name, Mitch?

44:55.610 --> 44:58.310
Okay, Mitch.

44:58.310 --> 45:02.010
I think we would feel a lot
more fucking comfortable

45:02.010 --> 45:03.340
if you took off
that fucking mask...

45:03.340 --> 45:04.770
Yeah, lose the mask.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.540
And you told us
what your real name was.

45:06.540 --> 45:09.170
I don't care which way you go,

45:09.180 --> 45:10.970
but you're almost
at the end of the haunted house.

45:10.980 --> 45:12.770
It's probably farther
if you go backwards.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.170
Yeah, I think we made it
pretty clear, Mitch.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.270
We don't want to go that way.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.540
'Kay. Wait, wait, wait.

45:16.540 --> 45:18.340
Why don't we just,
one at a time,

45:18.340 --> 45:19.870
go back through the tunnel?

45:19.880 --> 45:21.670
You really want to
go back in there?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.470
I just want to get out of here.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.340
Okay. All right.
Here's the plan.

45:26.340 --> 45:29.340
I sort of remember my way
around the maze.

45:29.340 --> 45:31.470
I'll take the lock box key,
I'll go through,

45:31.480 --> 45:33.040
I'll book it to the front,

45:33.040 --> 45:35.110
I'll get our phones,
and I'll call for help.

45:35.110 --> 45:37.070
Nate, let me get the key.

45:39.340 --> 45:41.510
I dropped it.

45:41.510 --> 45:44.010
Well, that is
just perfect, Nate.

45:44.010 --> 45:46.610
Fuck the key.
I can pick the lock box.

45:46.610 --> 45:48.370
All right, so, I'll go first.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.970
Then we send Bitch through,
and he can just chill

45:49.980 --> 45:51.470
on the other side
and wait for everyone else.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.010
Then, Nate, you go.

45:53.010 --> 45:54.440
Follow him with the poker,
you know, in case

45:54.440 --> 45:56.370
Mitch here forgets
whose team he's on.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.940
And then Bailey and Angela,
'cause they need the most help.

46:00.540 --> 46:02.670
And last goes Harper.

46:04.180 --> 46:07.270
One thing first.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.440
I want your keys.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.010
What key is it?

46:51.010 --> 46:53.710
Yellow, obviously.

47:17.980 --> 47:19.540
- I'm through!
- Okay, there it is.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.310
Let's go. You're up.

47:22.310 --> 47:24.440
Go.

47:28.110 --> 47:29.440
Think, think, think,
think, think.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.810
Um... safe or not safe?

47:31.810 --> 47:33.140
Safe or not safe?

47:33.140 --> 47:34.340
Okay.

47:36.140 --> 47:37.140
Fuck!

47:39.140 --> 47:40.540
Damn it.

48:04.940 --> 48:06.670
Okay.

48:06.680 --> 48:09.010
What's taking so fucking long?

48:17.480 --> 48:20.610
I'm here!

48:20.610 --> 48:22.640
Finally.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.270
Fuck.

49:21.710 --> 49:23.040
No.

49:28.210 --> 49:30.010
What the fuck?

49:53.610 --> 49:55.110
Run.

49:55.110 --> 49:56.640
No. We have to wait
for Nathan's signal.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.810
- Nathan, hurry up!
- Run!

49:59.810 --> 50:02.210
No! We have to wait or he's
gonna fall through the trap!

50:02.210 --> 50:03.670
Run!

50:03.680 --> 50:05.270
Run!

50:07.980 --> 50:09.340
Don't go! Don't go!

50:10.210 --> 50:11.940
No! No!

50:11.940 --> 50:13.770
Get in there. Come on! Let's go!
Come on! You can do it!

50:13.780 --> 50:15.510
Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!

50:16.610 --> 50:18.670
Oh, my God!

51:04.210 --> 51:06.370
Who's there?

51:06.380 --> 51:07.810
Nathan?

51:07.810 --> 51:10.340
I'm at a dead end!
We have to go back!

51:10.340 --> 51:11.940
No, which way?

51:11.940 --> 51:16.840
Go... Nathan?

51:16.840 --> 51:18.810
Nathan, are you there?

51:45.710 --> 51:47.670
What the fuck?

51:47.680 --> 51:50.440
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Where is it? Where is it?

52:30.480 --> 52:33.940
Where is everybody?

52:33.940 --> 52:35.910
They're right behind me.

52:39.280 --> 52:43.340
Where are our phones?

52:43.340 --> 52:45.110
Someone's bringing 'em.

53:25.640 --> 53:28.770
Please.

53:28.780 --> 53:32.670
Please. Please don't hurt me.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.210
Please.

53:34.210 --> 53:36.440
Please don't hurt me, Sam.

54:10.440 --> 54:12.340
Who's Sam?

54:18.610 --> 54:20.310
Hello?

54:20.310 --> 54:23.340
<i>Hey, man, who the fuck is this?</i>

54:23.340 --> 54:26.440
Who're you trying to reach?

54:26.440 --> 54:28.940
<i>I'm trying to reach Harper.</i>

54:28.940 --> 54:32.370
<i>This is her boyfriend, Sam.</i>

54:32.380 --> 54:35.540
<i>Hello?</i>

54:35.540 --> 54:37.440
You're too late, Sam.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.340
<i>All right, listen,
you little fuckin...</i>

55:13.980 --> 55:17.810
Such a pretty mask.

55:23.010 --> 55:26.840
Why don't we take it off...

55:26.840 --> 55:29.610
and find out who you really are?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.310
Run, Harper!

55:46.040 --> 55:49.340
Where is everybody?

55:49.340 --> 55:52.810
They should have been
out by now.

55:52.810 --> 55:55.740
Do you still want
to see my face?

55:58.440 --> 56:00.610
What?

56:00.610 --> 56:05.010
Do you still want
to see my face?

56:09.680 --> 56:11.440
It's whatever, man. I'm fine.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.710
Oh, why not?

56:16.140 --> 56:18.540
I just want to go home.

56:18.540 --> 56:23.470
2425 Lincoln Road?

56:23.480 --> 56:25.040
What?

56:25.040 --> 56:29.010
Because before, you said
you wanted to see my face,

56:29.010 --> 56:34.670
and I was just wondering if
you still wanted to see it.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.970
It's a bit of a work
in progress, but,

56:37.980 --> 56:41.140
oh, I think you'll like it.

58:06.210 --> 58:08.470
Shit.

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:42.910
Hello?

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.440
Who's there?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.740
Aaah!

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.110
Where are my friends?

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:31.410
Can you tell me where they are?

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:40.770
I just want to know if
my friends are still alive.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.310
I just need to know...
and we're cool.

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:48.440
And I-I just...

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.810
"Find the key to
escape the haunt."

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.770
Fuck.

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:18.370
Dolls?

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.770
"Something is hiding
under the bed."

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:52.109
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.270
Harper, where are you hiding?

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:18.840
Sweetie, look, uh...
Look, Mommy's fine.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:27.439
Adults...
do stupid things sometimes.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.710
Okay.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:36.340
You never have to hide
from me, okay?

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.670
I'm sorry.

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.840
Harper, tell me a story
about why you're sad.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.170
Do you think I'm sad?

01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:50.540
I grew up in a haunted house.

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.610
Come out.

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:02.510
Let's take off your mask.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.870
No.

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:16.040
Oh, fuck!

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.070
Come on.

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:11.340
My eye!

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.070
Aah! My fucking eye!

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:50.210
You ready?

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.270
No. No, no.

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:39.110
Oh, Bailey.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:42.440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:52.440
They're coming for you.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.010
They're coming for you.
They're coming for you!

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.840
Bailey.

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:10.610
No, no, no.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:18.370
Bailey...

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:13.670
Hello?

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.340
Hey, uh, look,
I'm looking for somebody.

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:21.110
Hey, man, I said
I'm looking for s...

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.670
Harper.

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:58.040
Nathan?

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.510
Back up.

01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.110
Someone's coming.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.510
Nathan!

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.610
Come on.

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:50.940
You still want to know my name?

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.770
This way. This way.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.140
Harper.

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.540
Come on.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.370
Look.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.640
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.710
I-I was just helping out.

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.870
I'm sorry.

01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:43.610
Look.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.110
This is so fucked up.

01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:52.640
They... They didn't tell me
it was gonna be real.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.510
I thought, you know,

01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:55.870
"Sure, we'll mess
with some kids,"

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:58.170
but then they started
killing them.

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.010
And then they said if...
If I killed someone,

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:04.740
that I would earn my face.

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:08.140
I'm just their errands guy,
you know?

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:11.670
I-I buy shit for them.
That's it.

01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:14.110
We... We can go to the cops.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:16.270
I don't... I don't know
their names, but one of them...

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.210
One of them
is a-a tattoo artist,

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.540
and the other one, he's...

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.970
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.840
It's fine, it's fine.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.870
Look, you're making
too much noise.

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.610
It's fine.
I know where they hide a gun.

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:37.110
I don't care.
We don't need it. Let's go.

01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:40.640
That's weird.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.670
It used to be right he...

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:14.110
Think you're the only one
who's made it this far?

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:25.170
Harper!

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.970
Come on.

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:20.270
Keys.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:22.070
Keys, keys.

01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:28.210
Nathan.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.670
Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:32.640
Let's go.

01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:47.870
Okay. Okay.

01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:23.840
Hey, hon. Sorry to bother you.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.170
Your friend is doing just fine.
He's in the next room.

01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:30.840
Just have a couple of release
forms I need you to sign.

01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:36.940
Fuck!

01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:41.810
Aah!

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.670
Let's take off your mask.
