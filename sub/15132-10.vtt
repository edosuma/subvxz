00:26.097 --> 00:30.472
400 for the charter of a boat,
that's what we agreed.

00:30.496 --> 00:33.149
That was before
the change in the weather.

00:36.239 --> 00:37.742
Winter tides have set in.

00:37.766 --> 00:39.985
Since yesterday.

00:40.008 --> 00:42.016
Can't predict nature.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.839
I like to think you can.

00:44.863 --> 00:50.050
Very well. We shall call it...

00:50.074 --> 00:56.563
600, and be done with it.

00:56.586 --> 00:59.287
And the rest on arrival.

00:59.305 --> 01:05.435
For such a price, I will expect
a premium carriage service, thank you.

01:05.459 --> 01:09.209
Well, I have much to prepare.
I assume we sail at dawn.

01:09.221 --> 01:14.652
I'll need quiet. I have a paper
to deliver on my research.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.351
All the peace that
the ocean allows.

01:20.921 --> 01:25.277
Oh, are there any restrictions
on luggage?

01:25.301 --> 01:28.072
If it's not bigger than the ship,
it comes aboard.

01:28.095 --> 01:30.818
Any bigger, it better float.

01:30.841 --> 01:34.068
It doesn't.

02:01.632 --> 02:05.624
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

02:29.533 --> 02:35.191
Something laid this,
and it'll be coming back for it.

02:35.259 --> 02:37.865
You know the law on eggs.

02:37.889 --> 02:40.476
You cannot move the species.

02:40.497 --> 02:42.993
They'll have to
find Tyre Island first.

02:43.017 --> 02:46.282
Tyre Island?
Never heard of such a place.

02:46.297 --> 02:49.738
It's uninhabited,
lies to the east of the arboreal isles.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.744
- Sinbad: Pull!
- I have done this before, you know.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.925
It's a simple shipment job.
Can we all just relax?

02:54.948 --> 02:56.178
Sinbad: Rope!

02:56.179 --> 02:59.993
Rina: Just so you know, no one
pays a fortune for a simple shipment.

03:00.017 --> 03:03.350
But you are a great bounty hunter.

03:05.606 --> 03:08.629
I thought I made it clear my cargo
was to be stored in the hold.

03:08.653 --> 03:11.565
I'm sorry. Have you seen
the size of our hold's hatch?

03:11.588 --> 03:15.527
Most gently! I told you before,
minimum movement!

03:15.548 --> 03:18.965
If I'm sleeping next to that,
I need to know it's not going to hatch.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.056
So simplistic, the shape of an egg,
so you assume it's an egg.

03:22.079 --> 03:23.958
I'm old-fashioned that way.

03:23.982 --> 03:25.658
What is it then?

03:25.681 --> 03:28.270
Private cargo.
Where are my quarters?

03:28.293 --> 03:32.614
Anwar, will you
show the professor to her cabin?

03:32.638 --> 03:36.398
- I'm not sharing with a stranger.
- I couldn't agree more.

03:36.421 --> 03:39.874
That's why you're going to be
out here with us. Okay?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.221
- Sinbad, all my books...
- Don't be rude.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.166
(Clears throat)
Through here.

03:48.593 --> 03:50.128
(Grunting)

04:20.798 --> 04:27.263
Cook: This will be the best
food you ever ate. Ah...

04:43.131 --> 04:47.515
I think you're on the wrong chart.
We're heading here.

04:47.534 --> 04:49.760
I think with the wind
it'll be about two days and then...

04:49.784 --> 04:53.518
And then I go north,
to the Tibal Plains.

04:53.541 --> 04:54.955
Oh.

05:01.863 --> 05:04.646
I thought you might
stay and help me.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.417
(Clears throat)

05:07.441 --> 05:09.549
You must've heard
stories of the Land of the Dead.

05:09.573 --> 05:11.570
You think too much.

05:14.976 --> 05:18.064
Have you ever
lost someone you loved?

05:18.087 --> 05:20.107
Nope.

05:20.999 --> 05:23.763
Oh. Lucky you.

05:23.786 --> 05:28.902
I have, my brother,
and I want to find him.

05:28.925 --> 05:32.704
I never had anyone to lose.

05:32.728 --> 05:36.428
- I was raised by tigers.
- You only had to say no.

05:39.231 --> 05:41.980
(Sighs)

05:45.048 --> 05:47.491
My father wanted a son.

05:48.489 --> 05:51.295
He left me out on a rock to die,

05:51.307 --> 05:54.111
and the tigers got there
before death did.

06:04.055 --> 06:09.160
So, could you possibly...
I need some space. Can you move that?

06:09.183 --> 06:12.461
Space? Thank you.

06:12.528 --> 06:15.931
(Chuckling)

06:15.999 --> 06:20.802
You prefer doodling to science,
I see.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.954
No, no, I have great
admiration for the self-taught.

06:23.977 --> 06:27.208
It shows real spirit.

06:29.075 --> 06:32.903
I believe my spirit was one
of the qualities Dr. Masood

06:32.923 --> 06:35.916
most admired at
Basra Imperial College.

06:35.985 --> 06:41.889
And you're on the <i>Providence</i>
presumably to further your research?

06:41.912 --> 06:46.182
- I have my ideas, yes.
- And are those ideas bold?

06:46.206 --> 06:49.662
Are they going to
change the world?

06:53.694 --> 06:57.698
I know that the shell of your cargo
isn't fibrous,

06:57.722 --> 07:01.892
nor is it entirely calcified.

07:01.915 --> 07:05.397
It's not an embryonic membrane.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.547
It's not an egg at all.

07:08.615 --> 07:13.919
It's a vessel, but for what?

07:18.262 --> 07:19.977
Well...

07:21.460 --> 07:28.833
It's paradise
and it's inside that shell.

07:28.834 --> 07:32.969
That vessel, my life's work.
Diseases eradicated,

07:32.970 --> 07:36.106
mutations gone.

07:36.174 --> 07:38.808
You built life?

07:38.876 --> 07:43.688
Our essence captured
in countless spores stored

07:43.711 --> 07:46.400
inside that shell.

07:49.986 --> 07:53.626
That's not possible.

07:53.649 --> 07:57.760
- Think bigger.
- Anwar: No.

07:57.783 --> 07:59.873
Then see for yourself.

07:59.896 --> 08:04.486
By the time you reach Tyre Island Island,
the release will be optimized.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.183
A barren island transformed,

08:07.207 --> 08:13.841
fertilized and filled with the
flora and fauna of Earth, a new Eden.

08:43.003 --> 08:44.677
(Clink)

08:44.700 --> 08:47.119
If you were an assassin,
that'd be the last sound you'd hear.

08:47.143 --> 08:52.177
Ah! That's what I love about you,
your cool temperament.

08:52.245 --> 08:56.982
Do you want some wine?
Or some milk?

09:03.920 --> 09:08.626
Very few men I've known
have got past the tiger thing.

09:11.225 --> 09:13.679
I like your den.

09:15.417 --> 09:19.726
Did you come here to make big cat jokes
or was there something you wanted?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.678
I just need to know,
is it because you can't help me

09:24.702 --> 09:26.732
or because you won't help me
search for my brother?

09:26.752 --> 09:28.478
Sinbad...

09:31.261 --> 09:33.850
even if I knew how to get there,

09:35.010 --> 09:37.417
- there are things the living shouldn't do.
- But this...

09:37.440 --> 09:40.122
Places they can't go.

09:40.190 --> 09:43.759
And the Land of the Dead is
one of them.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.486
Anwar?
What are you doing down here?

10:39.554 --> 10:43.392
- She took my room.
- And she wants a gourd of water all to herself.

10:43.415 --> 10:47.209
Can you believe it? I've never met
anyone with so many demands.

10:47.233 --> 10:52.005
- Even the Queen of Persia would expect less.
- The real issue is she's asked you to do it.

10:52.029 --> 10:56.100
Oh yeah? And you've met someone
smarter than you and now your head hurts.

10:56.116 --> 10:59.117
- Welcome to my world.
- She's a genius.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.309
You think? Then how come she doesn't
know Tyre Island's inhabited?

11:06.446 --> 11:07.680
What?

11:32.070 --> 11:33.905
Professor?

11:35.761 --> 11:40.283
This island we're sailing to,

11:40.308 --> 11:42.315
there's been a mistake.

11:42.339 --> 11:45.444
Sorry, what?

11:45.468 --> 11:51.988
Tyre Island
isn't right for your experiment.

11:52.056 --> 11:56.654
There are people,
people on Tyre.

11:56.677 --> 11:58.568
- No...
- Yeah.

11:58.591 --> 12:01.263
No, no, no.
No, no!

12:12.444 --> 12:14.675
The egg is overheating!

12:14.743 --> 12:16.444
It's in direct sunlight.

12:16.511 --> 12:18.813
It needs to be in the hold,
away from the light!

12:18.881 --> 12:21.615
It will be dark in a few hours.
The night will cool it.

12:21.683 --> 12:24.546
It needs to be cooled now unless you
want to find yourself in breach of contract!

12:24.570 --> 12:27.922
Why don't you try putting it
next to your heart?

12:27.923 --> 12:29.057
That should do it.

12:32.241 --> 12:34.437
(Sighs)

12:34.557 --> 12:39.772
Every two hours,
you will wash the egg with cold water.

12:39.796 --> 12:41.634
Every two hours, day and night!

12:41.702 --> 12:46.377
I am paying you for
a premium service on all levels.

12:46.388 --> 12:48.811
No problem.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.206
We'll draw up a rotor.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.730
Now please, eat.

12:54.753 --> 13:00.303
I've done autopsies on more
appetizing specimens.

13:01.976 --> 13:08.826
I make something out of nothing
and every day you savour every mouthful.

13:08.895 --> 13:12.667
Today she gets fresh dugong
and she calls it an autopsy.

13:12.690 --> 13:15.033
This is hard for an artist to hear.

13:15.101 --> 13:18.568
It's probably too subtle
for her palate.

13:18.636 --> 13:20.843
Eh...

13:23.191 --> 13:26.535
You need to be more careful
when choosing your clients.

13:26.559 --> 13:29.133
A ship is not
a good place for tension.

13:29.156 --> 13:33.017
Let's just remember how much money
we're going to make on this job.

13:33.084 --> 13:38.314
- A rotor between six of us is not that bad.
- Five. I don't do rotors.

13:41.799 --> 13:43.595
I will show her.

13:43.619 --> 13:49.265
These delicacies will whet the appetite
of even the stoniest heart. Ha!

13:50.800 --> 13:53.701
Probably best if I take that through.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.358
Just gently, please.

13:55.381 --> 13:59.091
Don't worry.
I have very light fingers.

13:59.109 --> 14:01.956
Some light refreshment?

14:01.979 --> 14:05.243
Better. In my cabin.

14:13.911 --> 14:16.706
Who else knows about Tyre?

14:16.729 --> 14:19.167
Only Rina.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.258
There's a penitentiary there.

14:22.270 --> 14:26.203
It's quite well-known, apparently,
among certain circles.

14:28.338 --> 14:31.450
Sometimes I wonder if there's
anywhere left that's out of reach.

14:31.474 --> 14:36.248
Rina is correct,
but the Tyans are a private people.

14:36.272 --> 14:39.463
It's a society almost completely
untouched by the modern world.

14:39.486 --> 14:42.370
It's perfect for my experiment.
Please, sit.

14:42.393 --> 14:45.235
Now, my agreement
with them is confidential

14:45.258 --> 14:47.841
and I would like to
keep it that way,

14:47.853 --> 14:53.169
but depending on
how the voyage goes, well...

14:54.081 --> 14:59.894
I would be honoured
if you would bear witness to my work.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.017
- Witness the egg?
- Mm.

15:05.041 --> 15:11.349
But I must be assured of
your absolute discretion, Anwar,

15:11.372 --> 15:14.707
as one scientist to another.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.591
- Yeah.
- Good.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.857
(Cracking)

15:38.338 --> 15:40.593
Your watch.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.902
Goodnight, Anwar.

15:47.344 --> 15:51.648
Don't forget to water your egg.

16:06.662 --> 16:08.095
(Soft moan)

16:23.611 --> 16:25.478
(Cracking)

17:11.496 --> 17:13.464
(Sighs)

17:27.778 --> 17:30.906
Perhaps it was always empty.

17:31.739 --> 17:37.153
- Okay, all we have to do is...
- Try and find whatever was inside.

17:37.220 --> 17:43.608
A perfect world
wrapped inside a protective shell.

17:43.631 --> 17:45.228
(Sighs)

17:45.240 --> 17:47.729
And I destroyed it!

17:47.753 --> 17:50.865
I fell asleep when
I should've washed the egg.

17:50.933 --> 17:57.484
Spores, countless spores,
all containing the essence of life.

17:57.508 --> 17:58.673
Have you quite finished?

17:58.740 --> 18:01.342
We've got to find these spores...
(Slam)

18:03.532 --> 18:05.856
(Smashing)
(Hissing)

18:05.880 --> 18:10.459
I don't know what a spore sounds like,
but it doesn't sound friendly.

18:10.858 --> 18:14.371
Rina, Tiger, go up
and keep the ship on course,

18:14.394 --> 18:19.373
and before the professor wakes up,
you two, we're going down to the hold.

18:21.694 --> 18:25.217
Fussy eaters
should not come to sea.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.328
Anwar: I realized the egg wasn't
entirely calcified, Sinbad.

18:29.351 --> 18:31.700
She explained to me...

18:31.723 --> 18:34.873
- Oh no.
- What?

18:34.993 --> 18:37.290
It's eaten everything.

18:37.314 --> 18:39.298
Look at this.

18:42.764 --> 18:45.983
(Sighs)
It doesn't make sense.

18:49.547 --> 18:52.929
(Slithering)

19:04.241 --> 19:08.022
Gunnar, look.
Some kind of skin.

19:11.005 --> 19:13.424
(Slithering)

19:13.944 --> 19:16.211
(Squawking)

19:19.520 --> 19:21.610
Give me the net.

19:31.558 --> 19:33.127
(Thud)
Oh!

19:33.195 --> 19:35.683
I hate it down here.

19:40.836 --> 19:43.591
(Low growling)
(Gasp)

19:43.614 --> 19:45.807
Gunnar!

19:45.808 --> 19:49.976
(Hissing)

19:50.044 --> 19:52.679
(Whooshing)

19:52.747 --> 19:57.651
(Shrieking)
Run! Go, go, go!

19:59.153 --> 20:01.655
(Shrieking)

20:04.858 --> 20:06.325
(Slam)

20:07.600 --> 20:10.309
You fools!
You wretched fools!

20:10.332 --> 20:12.152
It was you that
brought that thing onboard,

20:12.176 --> 20:14.759
and now you're going to tell us
what it is and how to get it off.

20:14.782 --> 20:16.101
What?
Put the lid back on the box?

20:16.102 --> 20:21.408
- Un-break the egg?
- You told me it was spores.

20:21.432 --> 20:27.082
- I gave you gold for passage, for delivery!
- For research and papers, not that!

20:27.105 --> 20:31.448
- We can still deliver.
- In what? In a barrel?

20:31.471 --> 20:33.526
You have no idea!

20:33.549 --> 20:35.593
Because you won't let us know
what it is we are dealing with.

20:35.605 --> 20:39.891
Professor,
that thing is a demon!

20:39.914 --> 20:42.179
Were his eyes fully formed?

20:42.202 --> 20:44.940
We really didn't get that intimate,
being so busy running for our lives.

20:44.964 --> 20:47.819
It's of vital importance!
The skin, what colour?!

20:47.840 --> 20:50.968
Pale. What does it matter?
(Groans)

20:52.526 --> 20:58.773
Second stage incisors.
Already fully formed.

20:59.552 --> 21:02.579
The growth will be quick.
(Slamming)

21:06.717 --> 21:09.885
What have you done?
(Slamming)

21:16.325 --> 21:20.454
I think it's nocturnal:
tough skin, those eyes.

21:20.477 --> 21:24.980
- Then it's a creature of the dark.
- Good. Then we have till sunset to kill it.

21:25.003 --> 21:29.547
And we use light against it.
We need pans, the shinier the better.

21:29.559 --> 21:31.743
(Sighs)

21:33.876 --> 21:37.970
- Gunnar?
- I just need to get some air.

21:40.169 --> 21:42.694
Sinbad.

21:45.559 --> 21:49.504
Anwar, would you be so kind?

21:50.758 --> 21:57.257
We need to work together
to protect the experiment.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.468
You mean the monster?
I want nothing to do with this.

22:00.492 --> 22:04.073
Tyre Island is overrun with
plague-infected rats.

22:04.096 --> 22:05.071
More stories?

22:05.094 --> 22:10.365
I created the serpent to destroy the plague.
That is its purpose.

22:10.389 --> 22:13.070
And what about the people of Tyre?

22:13.094 --> 22:16.675
- Look what it did to Gunnar.
- It's not harmful to humans,

22:16.699 --> 22:20.284
not normally.
It sleeps by day, hunts only at night.

22:20.352 --> 22:25.220
Now, it's unbalanced because it hatched prematurely,
and that is your oversight.

22:25.244 --> 22:29.609
Now, it's dangerous because its blood
is overly concentrated.

22:29.620 --> 22:32.184
Now, if we thin the blood,
we can calm it down.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.798
But I cannot do it without you.

22:34.866 --> 22:39.402
Can you live with yourself
if you don't help me?

22:47.644 --> 22:50.768
I can still swing a sword
with either hand.

23:03.318 --> 23:06.241
It should have exhausted itself.

23:10.332 --> 23:13.237
We'll be quite safe.
Come on.

23:16.838 --> 23:21.490
Okay. You take the bow,
I'll take the stern.

23:21.513 --> 23:26.054
Once you're in position,
you open the vial, release the vapour.

23:26.078 --> 23:28.515
Wait!

23:31.320 --> 23:33.587
Light could rouse its fury.

23:33.654 --> 23:38.024
We must move swiftly.
Go, go, go.

24:03.249 --> 24:06.771
(Slithering)

24:07.851 --> 24:10.458
Professor?

24:12.923 --> 24:15.210
(Grunting)

24:16.055 --> 24:17.476
Professor?

24:17.497 --> 24:19.763
Please let me out!

24:19.830 --> 24:22.843
(Squawking)

24:22.866 --> 24:26.436
Sinbad! Someone help!

24:26.437 --> 24:27.771
(Gasp)

24:37.447 --> 24:38.781
(Growl)

24:40.684 --> 24:44.352
Help me, someone!

24:44.420 --> 24:46.602
(Knocking)
Someone help!

24:46.614 --> 24:50.058
Anwar? Anwar!

24:50.059 --> 24:51.693
Oh no...
(Hissing)

24:55.097 --> 24:57.965
Ah!

24:58.033 --> 25:02.540
(Hissing)
Sinbad! Quickly! In the hatch!

25:05.741 --> 25:08.109
- Someone help! Quickly!
- Anwar! Anwar!

25:08.177 --> 25:12.080
(Hissing)

25:15.884 --> 25:18.852
Close the hatch!

25:18.920 --> 25:20.501
- Are you okay?
- Where is she?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.564
Who?

25:21.588 --> 25:23.892
Anwar, wait, I can explain!

25:26.279 --> 25:28.135
Everybody get back!

25:28.158 --> 25:33.055
- Professor!
- I mean it! Back off, Sinbad!

25:33.724 --> 25:35.873
Gunnar!

25:36.225 --> 25:38.178
(Shrieking)

25:38.190 --> 25:41.340
You, fatso, open the hatch!
Do it!

25:41.407 --> 25:44.944
Professor, calm down.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.349
Sorry, Anwar.
It needs to feed.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.919
(Shrieking)

25:54.920 --> 25:57.889
(Hissing)

25:57.957 --> 26:00.759
Help me!
(Hissing)

26:00.760 --> 26:03.728
(Screaming)

26:06.590 --> 26:09.900
Pull!
(Screaming)

26:13.171 --> 26:15.438
(Shrieking)

26:27.433 --> 26:29.997
We should have let it eat her.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.510
Tempting.

26:32.534 --> 26:36.059
But she's the only one who knows
what this creature is.

26:36.082 --> 26:38.987
So, if we're going to stand
any chance against it,

26:39.011 --> 26:41.488
we're going to need her help.

26:42.547 --> 26:45.886
With this fever,
she won't be helping anyone.

26:45.910 --> 26:48.058
Anwar.

26:54.396 --> 26:57.293
- My God.
- What?

26:58.528 --> 27:01.980
She's working with Caius Aponicus.

27:02.005 --> 27:05.373
He was a professor of the Creed,
a radical.

27:05.396 --> 27:09.633
He believed that humanity was fundamentally
flawed because of its compassion.

27:09.657 --> 27:13.473
He subscribed to a dark belief that

27:13.484 --> 27:18.814
a serpent would return and consume
the weak of every species.

27:18.815 --> 27:23.860
The Imperial College expelled him,
forbade him to teach again.

27:23.884 --> 27:26.540
This is only the beginning.
It's going to keep growing.

27:26.552 --> 27:29.616
(Slamming)
(Shrieking)

27:30.626 --> 27:31.993
(Slamming)
(Shrieking)

27:34.030 --> 27:38.140
It's going to destroy the ship.

27:38.163 --> 27:41.340
(Hissing)
(Slamming)

27:41.360 --> 27:44.589
Then we need to get off it.

28:43.341 --> 28:45.818
(Shrieking)

28:47.567 --> 28:51.430
- Come on, we have to leave.
- I can't leave.

28:56.608 --> 28:59.697
This isn't up for discussion.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.342
As old as time,
no end, no beginning,

29:04.365 --> 29:08.218
- born of dust and fire.
- Cook!

29:08.241 --> 29:10.786
We don't have time for this.

29:10.805 --> 29:13.740
You need to pull your head out of
your musings and wake up to the fact

29:13.764 --> 29:16.450
that if you stay you're going to
drown with the ship.

29:16.473 --> 29:19.027
Then it is as it was written.

29:20.568 --> 29:24.787
You long to go to the Land of the Dead,
Sinbad.

29:26.208 --> 29:29.801
We all have our destinies.

29:29.824 --> 29:33.930
- You cannot change that.
- No, this isn't destiny.

29:33.953 --> 29:38.153
This is a crazy scientist
with a giant snake.

29:38.991 --> 29:43.453
I'm not going to leave you here.

29:43.934 --> 29:46.400
Come.

29:46.921 --> 29:49.876
This isn't
how you're meant to go.

29:49.900 --> 29:53.829
Now is not your time to die.

30:06.016 --> 30:08.705
Cook's refusing to abandon ship,

30:08.729 --> 30:13.536
- and I can't leave him behind.
- Then I'm not leaving either.

30:17.122 --> 30:19.684
Then we must stay.

30:21.647 --> 30:25.745
If we are staying,
then does anyone actually have a plan?

30:26.980 --> 30:29.634
Gunnar?

30:31.631 --> 30:36.940
Try and surivive till sunrise,
and then bring it down.

30:44.753 --> 30:46.905
We have secured the hold.

30:46.928 --> 30:50.075
Now let's batten down
the main hatch.

30:54.922 --> 30:57.514
Hammer them in place!

31:16.916 --> 31:19.695
Anwar, guide her in.

31:45.036 --> 31:48.277
(Shrieking)
(Slamming)

31:48.641 --> 31:50.947
It sounds like it's breaking
through the hold

31:50.971 --> 31:53.516
To night feed.
It's hunting.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.645
(Shrieking)
(Slamming)

31:55.668 --> 31:59.155
- One more set of hatches.
- Then we are the next course.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.258
How about we give it
a feast to remember?

32:02.326 --> 32:04.774
(Shrieking)

32:04.797 --> 32:07.762
Us. Human bait.

32:09.810 --> 32:11.900
We can use the cage.

32:11.924 --> 32:14.673
Yes, then it goes for the bait,
we hoist it up.

32:14.697 --> 32:17.157
Then we take its head off.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.009
Wait. We should do this at dawn.
It hates the light.

32:22.147 --> 32:25.379
- There won't be anything left by dawn.
- Okay.

32:47.228 --> 32:50.340
Professor?

32:52.906 --> 32:55.239
(Hissing)

32:55.263 --> 32:58.343
Professor, don't!
(Splat)

33:00.369 --> 33:03.827
- Her work consumed her.
- Maybe she found a conscience after all.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.850
She wasn't the conscience type.

33:05.873 --> 33:09.851
- It's eaten. Should buy us some time.
- No, we have less time.

33:09.875 --> 33:13.118
The more it eats,
the more dangerous it becomes.

33:13.129 --> 33:16.147
We need to do this now.

33:23.124 --> 33:24.511
Once more.

33:24.535 --> 33:29.382
Everyone clear, open up the hatch as
quickly as you can, lower me down slowly,

33:29.405 --> 33:31.289
- then close it back up, okay?
- Alright.

33:31.312 --> 33:34.060
You only get one chance.
Okay.

33:37.105 --> 33:39.792
- What are you doing?
- The plan.

33:39.815 --> 33:42.073
Out. I go inside.

33:44.323 --> 33:47.763
That thing could tear this cage
clean off the rope.

33:47.782 --> 33:48.816
And if it doesn't,

33:48.839 --> 33:50.714
you're going to need someone
who's good with animals.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.784
I think I have that covered.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.488
Pull it!

33:58.641 --> 34:00.485
Okay, fine.

34:05.007 --> 34:09.498
- Now bring it round.
- Move that plank.

34:10.719 --> 34:14.737
Whatever you do,
don't get out of the cage.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.487
Board her up, quick.

34:32.489 --> 34:36.679
As soon as the serpent grabs the cage,
we hoist it up.

34:40.128 --> 34:42.864
Keep listening.

35:05.137 --> 35:09.154
(Thump)

35:49.628 --> 35:51.462
(Sloshing)

35:54.899 --> 35:57.484
(Hissing and shrieking)
(Yells): Up!

35:57.508 --> 35:59.739
Up!

36:06.811 --> 36:09.970
Bring her up, lift her up,
lift her up!

36:09.993 --> 36:11.795
Tiger!

36:11.915 --> 36:15.551
Bring her down.

36:23.359 --> 36:25.226
I swear I saw it.

36:25.294 --> 36:28.178
- She's inside the creature.
- Tiger, it's very dark down there.

36:28.201 --> 36:30.765
- Maybe you...
- I know what I saw.

36:32.336 --> 36:34.368
Dear God.

36:36.122 --> 36:38.418
This was her breakthrough.

36:40.993 --> 36:45.330
She wasn't just creating life,
she was merging it with herself.

36:45.353 --> 36:50.120
So, before it had strength,
and now it has strength and intelligence?

36:50.144 --> 36:53.608
Yes. Her intelligence.

36:54.924 --> 37:02.739
Or the Professor in in the serpent.
The serpent is in her,

37:02.762 --> 37:06.568
shared life force,
shared intelligence.

37:06.582 --> 37:12.537
Perhaps, if the spirits are willing,
shared weakness.

37:12.561 --> 37:15.414
What? No sense of humour?

37:16.611 --> 37:19.794
She's trying to sink us!

37:22.997 --> 37:26.343
(Slamming)

37:26.367 --> 37:28.187
She didn't like my nuts.

37:28.210 --> 37:33.253
Anything with almonds, pistachios,
walnuts, she did not touch.

37:33.275 --> 37:36.578
I once saw a man die
from eating nuts.

37:36.594 --> 37:39.929
His throat swelled up
and he choked on his own tongue.

37:39.940 --> 37:43.131
- You're planning to kill a serpent with nuts?
- Yeah.

37:43.154 --> 37:45.050
Someone needs to
make a decision.

37:45.073 --> 37:47.353
If it keeps on smashing
a hole in the hull like that,

37:47.421 --> 37:49.489
we'll be up to our necks in water.

37:49.557 --> 37:52.559
- The lower deck's beginning to flood.
- If we just hang on till dawn...

37:52.560 --> 37:55.307
- With nuts, really?
- At least then we'll have the sun on our side.

37:55.319 --> 37:57.996
Whatever we decide,
we need to do it quickly.

37:58.019 --> 38:00.403
(Slamming)
Fine.

38:00.427 --> 38:02.740
And we're going to need fire.

38:02.759 --> 38:05.953
Every living thing is a-feared of fire.

38:05.970 --> 38:09.225
- Afraid.
- That's what I said, a-feared!

38:09.237 --> 38:11.421
More nuts!

38:17.849 --> 38:20.150
(Slamming)
(Shrieking)

38:22.721 --> 38:27.591
(Slamming)
(Shrieking)

38:39.970 --> 38:42.938
(Slamming)
(Hissing)

38:43.897 --> 38:46.930
Gunnar, try and hold on.

38:46.942 --> 38:51.213
My dying breath will be to
curse that creature as it dies.

38:51.237 --> 38:54.067
Only three arrows?

38:57.553 --> 39:00.421
(Shrieking)
(Slamming)

39:07.909 --> 39:09.930
Sinbad!

39:13.153 --> 39:15.407
(Hissing)

39:15.431 --> 39:18.672
- Cook, arrow.
- Here.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.781
(Hissing)

39:48.365 --> 39:51.594
- Where did it go?
- Hold still.

39:58.886 --> 40:02.179
I can't see it.

40:10.755 --> 40:12.489
(Screaming)

40:12.557 --> 40:14.658
- Anwar!
- Anwar!

40:14.726 --> 40:17.660
Anwar!

40:24.369 --> 40:26.336
Stay back, everyone.

40:27.705 --> 40:30.406
(Gasping)

40:34.455 --> 40:38.975
- Last arrow.
- No pressure then.

40:40.709 --> 40:44.019
Drive it up
and out of the water!

41:15.773 --> 41:20.879
- At last! Dawn!
- Quick, Cook, the pans!

42:00.732 --> 42:03.235
Really, Cook? Eggs?

42:03.258 --> 42:07.156
It was the only thing it didn't eat,
drew the line at cannibalism.

42:08.672 --> 42:11.540
Remind me to teach you
how to use a crossbow.

42:16.374 --> 42:21.284
You could just say it,
that you want me to stay.

42:25.632 --> 42:30.422
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

42:30.726 --> 42:32.327
I know a place.

42:34.898 --> 42:37.867
A monastery on
the island of Malta

42:37.879 --> 42:43.204
houses an ancient collection of maps,
strange fantastical maps.

42:43.272 --> 42:48.113
They say they chart the island
of the sirens and of the rooks.

42:48.137 --> 42:52.289
- Nonsense, of course.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

42:52.313 --> 42:55.835
If I was looking for a map to
the Land of the Dead,

42:55.859 --> 42:58.348
that's where I'd look.

43:00.254 --> 43:02.122
If.
