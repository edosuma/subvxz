00:02.636 --> 00:05.504
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> I'm visiting an inn</i>
<i> in Massachusetts</i>

00:05.539 --> 00:07.706
<i> that's being run</i>
<i> by a dysfunctional couple.</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.676
[crying]
I love you so much, but you suck
as a business partner.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.211
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> He's lost...</i>

00:12.246 --> 00:13.512
I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.680
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> And she's lost it.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:16.215
[sobs]

00:16.250 --> 00:18.183
Just wanted
to keep it together tonight.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.818
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>And with the staff suffering</i>
<i> as well...</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:21.220
What's the worst thing
she's ever done to you?

00:21.255 --> 00:23.422
Smacked me
on the back of the head.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.690
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> I'm not even sure</i>
<i>if I can get through to them.</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:26.959
<i>The whole operation is screwed.</i>

00:26.994 --> 00:28.227
What do you think we should do?

00:28.262 --> 00:30.229
- Close.
- Have a nice night.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.905
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> Nestled in the heart</i>
<i> of scenic New England</i>

00:39.940 --> 00:43.442
<i>lies the small industrial town</i>
<i>of Southbridge, Massachusetts.</i>

00:45.513 --> 00:47.980
<i> It's home to</i>
<i>the Vienna Inn and Restaurant.</i>

00:48.015 --> 00:50.516
<i> Husband and wife,</i>
<i> Jonathan and Lisa Krach,</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:52.584
<i> have owned</i>
<i> and operated the inn</i>

00:52.620 --> 00:55.054
<i> since buying the property</i>
<i> back in the year 2000.</i>

00:55.089 --> 00:57.956
<i> (Lisa)</i>
<i>Jonathan had this crazy idea</i>

00:57.992 --> 01:00.325
of creating the Vienna

01:00.361 --> 01:03.829
as an Austrian restaurant
and bed-and-breakfast.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.632
She said,
"Have you been drinking?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.468
I said, "No, not yet."
[chuckles]

01:09.503 --> 01:13.505
<i> (Lisa)</i>
<i> We try to transport people</i>
<i>and to give them that feeling</i>

01:13.541 --> 01:16.542
of being in Vienna
without having to fly there.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.581
<i> (David)</i>
<i>When people come in and they</i>
<i>stay here for the first time,</i>

01:22.616 --> 01:24.550
they think that Jonathan and
Lisa are very gracious hosts,

01:24.585 --> 01:27.286
<i> charming,</i>
<i> the perfect married couple.</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:29.455
<i> but if you dig</i>
<i> a little bit deeper</i>

01:29.490 --> 01:31.523
<i> and you stay</i>
<i> a little bit longer,</i>

01:31.559 --> 01:33.058
you find out
it's quite a different story.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.660
<i> (Melissa)</i>
<i>Lisa is an emotional person.</i>

01:34.695 --> 01:36.328
<i> She does get upset often.</i>

01:36.363 --> 01:38.430
<i> She will just,</i>
<i> you know, explode</i>

01:38.466 --> 01:41.400
and she can't help
but be upset.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.601
<i> She's over the top.</i>

01:42.636 --> 01:44.403
[snaps belt]

01:44.438 --> 01:47.706
<i> (Jonathan)</i>
<i> My beautiful wife, my boss,</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:49.975
sometimes
she's not so nice to me.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.812
Why do you always have to dress
like a [bleep], like, dumb?

01:53.848 --> 01:55.881
There has been a time where
I called her a "psycho {bleep}"

01:55.916 --> 01:57.416
'cause she was being
a psycho {bleep}.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.586
Clean up, man.
I'm done with this.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.621
<i> (Jessica)</i>
<i> I don't feel</i>
<i> like Lisa's authentic.</i>

02:02.656 --> 02:05.691
When she's crying, I don't
feel like she ever means it.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.527
[sobbing]

02:09.964 --> 02:12.831
Jonathan and Lisa
live in a room at the inn.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.500
<i> You can hear them</i>
<i> screaming at each other.</i>

02:14.535 --> 02:15.667
<i> You can hear it</i>
<i> in the dining room.</i>

02:15.703 --> 02:17.636
<i> So there's no boundaries.</i>

02:17.671 --> 02:19.471
<i> They'll come down after the</i>
<i>shift at the end of the night,</i>

02:19.507 --> 02:22.007
<i> and they'll have cigars,</i>
<i> have some drinks.</i>

02:22.042 --> 02:24.343
The environment can quickly
become unprofessional.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.711
She'll go up to a table

02:25.746 --> 02:26.879
and ask them about,
like, their sex lives.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.914
You are good-looking.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.049
<i> (David)</i>
<i>We don't get that many locals</i>
<i> at the Vienna.</i>

02:31.085 --> 02:32.951
There's, like, a lot of things

02:32.987 --> 02:35.120
that people think in town
about the Vienna,

02:35.156 --> 02:38.590
<i> and I think it's become</i>
<i> a little taboo.</i>

02:38.626 --> 02:40.592
<i> (Lisa)</i>
<i> You have those rumors</i>
<i> going around.</i>

02:40.628 --> 02:42.461
<i> People say,</i>
<i> "Ooh, the Vienna.</i>

02:42.496 --> 02:44.663
<i> They're all swingers.</i>
<i> It's a big brothel."</i>

02:44.698 --> 02:46.899
<i> It's just--</i>
<i> it's just ridiculous.</i>

02:46.934 --> 02:49.535
It's ridiculous.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.504
That being said,
we're very friendly people...

02:52.540 --> 02:55.073
very friendly.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.879
<i> (David)</i>
<i>People from the outside think</i>
<i>the Vienna's doing very well</i>

03:00.915 --> 03:02.648
<i> and we're very prosperous,</i>

03:02.683 --> 03:05.350
but somewhere in there,
we're losing.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.718
<i> (Melissa)</i>
<i> They're dragging us down</i>
<i> with them,</i>

03:06.754 --> 03:08.654
<i> and if they want us</i>
<i> to help them,</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:11.590
they--they need to help us.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.392
<i> (Jonathan)</i>
<i> The Vienna is our home,</i>

03:13.427 --> 03:16.395
<i> has been for 13-plus years.</i>

03:16.430 --> 03:19.164
And, you know,
it's hanging by a thread.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.167
<i> [somber music]</i>

03:22.203 --> 03:25.103

<i> [upbeat music]</i>

03:28.142 --> 03:32.544
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:32.580 --> 03:34.713
And this,
5:30 at table five.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.486
Look at this place.
My God.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.556
What happened to him?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.692
He didn't last very long,
did he?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.060
<i> (Jonathan)</i>
<i> He found our cat.</i>

03:48.095 --> 03:50.028
[laughter]

03:50.064 --> 03:51.997
Well, bloody hell.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.599
Dead cat and a cabbage.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.468
Isn't that funny?

03:56.503 --> 03:58.103
- Good morning.
- Hello, welcome.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.205
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, good to see you too.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.506
Gordon.
First name is?

04:01.542 --> 04:02.741
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.875
(Lisa)
Good morning.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.110
- How are you?
- How are you?

04:05.145 --> 04:06.578
- Lisa Krach.
- Lisa, nice to see you.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.814
- You don't look very happy.
- I do.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.682
- It's my resting face.
- Oh, this is your happy face?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.818
- Well, um...
- Yes, welcome to the Vienna.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.952
So happy to be here.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.520
What happened to the cat?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.122
- [chuckles]
- Poor thing.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.557
(Lisa)
Cat got run over.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.559
Oh, I see.
And you got it stuffed?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.761
- For Halloween.
- Right.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.797
Actually,
better to see you now.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.000
Right, um, yeah.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.801
Uh, love the attire,
by the way.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.703
Thank you.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.105
(Melissa)
Everyone wears this.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.940
Well, how much are the outfits?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.608
About $300, $400.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.976
- $300?
- $300.

04:38.012 --> 04:38.977
Average, you know.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.512
They get their own.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.580
I mean, they're
their own dresses, you know?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.748
Oh, you buy your own uniforms?

04:42.783 --> 04:43.782
- Yes.
- Yes, they do.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.117
- Stop it.
- We do.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.652
Well, they have 'em
for many years.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.253
And it reminds them
to not gain weight.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.722
[chuckles]

04:50.758 --> 04:52.557
(Gordon)
Wow, so who designed the place?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.593
Well, uh, my husband and I.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.994
And whose idea
was it to buy it?

04:56.030 --> 04:57.996
Uh, my husband.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.098
- So it wasn't yours?
- It was not my idea.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.833
I was actually
very much against it.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.068
Wow.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.503
Why were you against it?

05:04.538 --> 05:05.771
It was very overwhelming.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.539
I had two small children.

05:07.574 --> 05:11.643
Probably, uh, after I lost
my mind the first year...

05:11.679 --> 05:13.645
I think we started
to get a hang of it.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.047
And who's Austrian?
Are you from--

05:15.082 --> 05:16.815
My husband's half-Austrian
and Polish.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.917
- Right.
- I'm not nearly as exotic.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.085
I'm very American.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.753
- Right,
and he's the chef, right?

05:21.789 --> 05:24.156
So he runs the restaurant,
kitchen, and you run the inn.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.691
Correct.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.693
And whose idea
was the violins on the table?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.561
<i> - Mine.</i>
<i> - Where'd that come from?</i>

05:29.596 --> 05:32.097
That was actually from
an estate sale down the street.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.699
A dead man's violin?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.801
- No, no.
- Yeah, why not?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.003
I don't want to sit
across a table with my wife

05:38.038 --> 05:39.738
and look
at a dead man's violin.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.206
- Well--
- Bit freaky, no?

05:41.241 --> 05:42.674
I don't know.
What would you rather look at

05:42.710 --> 05:43.909
when you see the Vienna?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.211
- Her.
- Who's "her"?

05:46.246 --> 05:48.146
- My wife.
- Oh, your wife, yes.

05:48.182 --> 05:52.351
But you have to have something
to make up that white space.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.320
- What would you suggest?
- My wife.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.055
[chuckles]
You gonna put her on the table?

05:57.091 --> 05:58.357
That's kind of scandalous.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.258
I am so [bleep] confused.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.027
<i> Dead man's violin.</i>

06:02.062 --> 06:03.895
What about some flowers?

06:03.931 --> 06:07.566
Bloody hell, is this place
always as clustered as this?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.937
- And who's that there?
- A Prussian family, of course.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.805
That was, uh, Friedrich,

06:13.841 --> 06:16.641
that their family
all was murdered--

06:16.677 --> 06:18.076
- Murdered?
- Yes.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.712
Wow. So dead man's violin
and murder on the wall.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.249
Great story to encourage
a nice, warm, welcoming dinner.

06:24.284 --> 06:27.152
So why don't
I check in upstairs?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.620
You can do that right now.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.921
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.156
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.859
Wow.
[shudders]

06:33.894 --> 06:35.727
Wow.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.330
<i> Interesting indeed.</i>
<i> Just a clutter.</i>

06:38.365 --> 06:39.998
- Your bedroom's over here.
- Rocking chair?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.633
Where's that from?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.368
That's actually the first piece
I ever refinished.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.936
Wow.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.139
So you're quite
an antiques hoarder.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.907
[knock at door]
- Room service.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.309
Oh, room service.
Come in.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.911
Holy mackerel.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.279
Now, what we have here
is some pulled boar.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.081
- Shredded. Shredded.
- Oh, pulled. Right.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.683
And then you have a little
celery root right on top.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.185
Wow.
And what's that?

07:00.220 --> 07:01.186
(Lisa)
It's a little parsley.

07:01.221 --> 07:05.090
Excellent.
Um...

07:05.125 --> 07:07.025
- Take one.
- Would you like me to have one?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.860
Yeah, of course.
There's three pieces.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.228
- Okay.
- Excellent.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.930
- Sure.
- Thank you.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.698
- Thank you for sharing.
- You're welcome.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.200
Hold on.
Wait, wait.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.035
Let me put a little bit
of the garnish on there--

07:17.070 --> 07:18.403
You want me to have that?

07:18.439 --> 07:21.006
Yeah, we'll have
a little piece each.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.917
What did you think of that,
by the way?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.352
Celery root--
really don't like it.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.422
The pulled boar--
maybe just a bit more salt.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.157
Wow. And what did you
think of that?

07:39.193 --> 07:40.992
I think it's a nice little
surprise for people

07:41.028 --> 07:44.329
when they come in
to liven up their appetite.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.131
Boar was very watery.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.833
It was very watery.
I did notice that.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.935
And the bread was soggy,
soaking wet.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.403
From the celery root.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.405
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your stay.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.474
Please pass on my comments
to the chef.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.209
I definitely will.

07:58.745 --> 07:59.878
Here we go.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.048
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> Oh, dear.</i>

08:03.083 --> 08:04.282
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Wow.</i>

08:04.318 --> 08:05.784
And who designed
these bedrooms?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.419
I designed everything.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.854
You designed?

08:08.889 --> 08:11.122
Mm-hmm.
I wallpapered it as well.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.757
Seriously?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.226
What's this?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.961
That's another closet.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.295
What do you mean,
another closet?

08:17.331 --> 08:18.730
I don't have a closet
in my bedroom.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.265
That's the closet that we have

08:20.300 --> 08:22.801
because there's an area
over here for guests to use.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.803
But where am I gonna hang
my clothes?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.137
Right over here.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.077
But...

08:32.112 --> 08:33.411
You don't need
an entire closet.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.914
So if you need clothes
out of your closet--

08:35.949 --> 08:37.349
I have to plan ahead.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.884
Do you have the key on you?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.085
I do.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.520
Can I see inside?
I just--

08:41.555 --> 08:43.221
I'm a bit freaked with
locked doors in my bedroom.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.056
- Gosh.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.491
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.260
- It's right here.
- Oh, it's there?

08:48.295 --> 08:50.996
Wow.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.331
[chuckles]

08:53.367 --> 08:55.033
(Lisa)
Just my closet.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.368
(Gordon)
Holy crap.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.802
- Stop it.
- Yeah.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.237
- Stop it?
- Seriously?

08:59.273 --> 09:00.972
(Lisa)
All my stuff.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.974
(Gordon)
It's like a garage sale
in a closet.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.809
(Lisa)
That's why we keep
a lock on it.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.211
I've got no interest
in wearing any of the garments,

09:06.246 --> 09:07.479
but thank you.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.147
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.749
100% positive.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.084
Bloody hell.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.953
- What's the price of this room?
- This one is $220.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.056
- $220, yeah?
- Correct.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.859
And I have to share my wardrobe
with the owner.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.794
What's through this room here?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.496
That actually goes
to my bedroom.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.432
So do you just walk in when
you need to get some clothes?

09:27.467 --> 09:29.000
From here?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.936
No, but from your bedroom
to my bedroom.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.837
Well, I only do that
once or twice a week.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.275
And what's this?

09:37.311 --> 09:38.543
Wow.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.978
It's an antique purse

09:40.013 --> 09:41.580
that was actually found
in the house,

09:41.615 --> 09:44.316
and we thought it was
really neat to be able to have.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.518
That's for--
that's a toothbrush holder

09:46.553 --> 09:48.954
in case you decide
to take it along with you.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.488
That's a toothbrush holder?

09:50.524 --> 09:53.224
Or you could stick tampons in
there if you really wanted to.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.993
We do usually have those--

09:55.028 --> 09:56.494
Oh, they're not in there
right now.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.996
- There you go.
- It's an old lady's case.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.098
Mm-hmm, just trying
to think of clever ideas

10:00.133 --> 10:03.168
to make this feel
like a historic inn.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.903
Historic.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.871
- Mm.
- It's definitely historic.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.273
Oh.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.908
Bloody hell.
How old is that?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.443
You need that?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.178
No, just fascinated
to see what's in my basket.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.647
Thank you for that.
Oh, dear.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.415
Everything looks dated.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.051
I mean, first impressions--
it looks very, very tired.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.020
What is all that?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.055
That's if somebody wants
to throw roses on the bed.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.190
Oh, for God's sake.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.458
Isn't that adorable?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.960
And then they go back
in the drawer...

10:28.996 --> 10:30.629
- I guess so.
- Once you've used them.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.400
Okay, well, I'll look forward
to seeing you downstairs.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.701
- I'll have lunch.
- Super.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.304
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.206
Wow.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.241
[bleep].

10:43.276 --> 10:45.310
That's freaky.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.213
The owner's bedroom
is literally a meter away.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.614
The place is so dated.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.484
What a mess.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.019
[bleep].

10:55.322 --> 10:57.689
Everything's just cluttered.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.257
What a mess.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.560
Look at this.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.696
Ay-yi-yi.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.098
I mean, seriously.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.633
Bloody hell.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.402
[bleep] everywhere.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.004
Old decorations.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.572
Terrible.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.312
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> Shall I sit here, then?</i>

11:21.348 --> 11:22.681
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.582
You can sit
wherever you prefer.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.351
Boom, boom, boom.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.319
Let's get some food out.
You want to get some food out?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.421
(man)
Yeah.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.256
What's in here?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.591
[bleep].

11:33.627 --> 11:35.126
[whispering]
Lisa, there's junk everywhere.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.328
Mm-hmm.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.997
Yeah, I know.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.499
Everywhere.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.101
Is the whole house
packed like this?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.335
Of course it is.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.470
- Why?
- It's crazy.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.138
Have you always been
this bad?

11:47.174 --> 11:48.707
It's a new thing
I'm coming to terms with.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.208
- Right.
- It's just--

11:50.243 --> 11:51.276
But you do have a problem
with it?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.977
Actually, no.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.379
I think I've actually gotten rid
of a lot of things

11:54.414 --> 11:55.547
in the past couple years.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.482
You don't have a problem

11:57.517 --> 11:59.417
with everything I've just seen
in the last ten minutes?

11:59.453 --> 12:01.453
Wow.
Oh, well.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.455
There you go.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.523
Right, let's, uh...
Oh, jeez.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.292
Do you know
how to say all these?

12:07.327 --> 12:10.161
How do you pronounce that?
[murmurs indistinctly]

12:10.197 --> 12:12.330
You've been here a long time.
You must know the lingo.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.165
[speaking German]

12:14.201 --> 12:16.401
A lot people must point to what
they want to order, right?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.069
- Yes.
- Or just pick up the last line.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.604
How do you pronounce that?

12:19.639 --> 12:21.539
-<i> Koenigsberger klopse. </i>
- Wow.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.775
And how long's this menu
been running like this?

12:23.810 --> 12:25.376
Since the beginning.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.745
Oh, 13 years ago?
Stop.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.346
- Yes, yes.
- Seriously?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.681
Let's start off with--

12:29.716 --> 12:31.249
- Go for the scallops.
- Okay.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.184
Let's do the beer-battered
sauerkraut.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.019
Yeah, let's go for that.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.689
And throw the vegetarian
mushroom ravioli in as well.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.190
- Wonderful.
- Okay, great.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.291
I'll keep hold
of the menu for now.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.726
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.561
Sear it in first.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.796
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.599
Almost lost it.
Regroup, regroup.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.401
- Where is Missy?
- I'll bring it right out.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.704
This is Ramsay's first.
Red pepper beurre blanc.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.507
(Val)
Yes, sir.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.309
Our seared diver scallops
with a red pepper beurre blanc.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.544
Wow.
Thank you.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.045
And scallops
are normally round, right?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.113
(Lisa)
Yes, they are.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.348
We have beautiful
sea scallops.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.083
I'm not sure why
they cut it up today.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.384
Oh, normally.
Oh, well...

13:06.419 --> 13:07.519
- Thanks.
- Okay, enjoy.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.787
Thank you very much.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.088
Looks like
the dog's chewed them.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.556
I mean, seriously.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.127
That's rancid.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.662
- [speaks indistinctly]
- Excuse me?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.430
What you like me to give any
comments to back to the chef?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.166
Comments?
Yeah, they're [bleep].

13:21.201 --> 13:22.734
- Thank you.
- Terrible.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.569
We'll have Val
take care of it for you.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.638
- Who's Val?
- Me.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.273
(Gordon)
I like the way you talk about
yourself in third person.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.309
Seared diver scallops
taste like [bleep].

13:31.344 --> 13:32.644
Taste like [bleep]?
Really?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.245
Wow. Okay.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.214
Any specific kind
of [bleep] or just--

13:36.249 --> 13:38.583
- No.
- Diarrhea [bleep].

13:38.618 --> 13:40.251
Wow.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.855
These here are
the Sauerkraut en Backtieg.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.390
And are these edible flowers
or not?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.692
- They are. Chrysanthemums.
- They are?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.828
- Okay, great. Thank you.
- All right.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.564
Hmm.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.165
Stay right there.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.336
They are terrible.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.737
I mean, the food is so dated.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.372
It's extraordinary.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.608
They look like a pair
of camel's [bleep].

14:05.679 --> 14:07.212
Hmm.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.815
This I have here
is the mushroom crepes.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.251
Tarragon crème.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.154
Wow. I mean,
what a [bleep] mess.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.826
There she is.
[bleep] hell.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.394
Val.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.596
- Val.
- Yes?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.564
Delicious.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.900
I mean, [bleep]--
No, no, [bleep] delicious.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.768
Seriously.
Really good.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.303
No, the flowers
I'm on about.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.172
Oh, you had me going there
for a whole second.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.274
I thought it was
all about the food.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.942
- I...
- Maybe next course.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.345
(Val)
Jonathan, the flowers
are absolutely delicious.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.880
The flowers?

14:41.915 --> 14:44.415
And this menu doesn't change
every decade?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.284
It's the same menu
that's been on for 13 years?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.719
- Jonathan doesn't change much.
- Except for the additions.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.554
Oh, sorry.
I asked you a question.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.656
- Lisa was answering.
- Jonathan doesn't change much.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.124
- [bleep].
- I'm sorry.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.692
You answer
Melissa's question first

14:54.728 --> 14:56.261
then I'll go back to Melissa.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.862
You said this doesn't change
but once a decade,

14:57.898 --> 14:59.664
and I said,
"Jonathan doesn't change much."

14:59.699 --> 15:00.798
(Gordon)
Right.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.502
<i> You've been here a long time.</i>

15:04.537 --> 15:06.938
You've seen the place
in decline.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.506
What's
the big issues here?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.241
Little disorganization.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.843
- Things unclear.
- Yeah.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.478
<i> - Nothing consistent?</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

15:13.513 --> 15:15.413
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>one puts the other on edge,</i>

15:15.448 --> 15:17.482
and we get
the brunt end of it.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.717
Lisa's listening to every word
you're saying.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.753
I can barely hear you.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.188
No, no, I was just talking
to Melissa.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.957
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll leave.

15:25.992 --> 15:29.494
Do whatever you need to do.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.229
What's the worst thing
she's ever done to you?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.864
Smacked me
on the back of the head

15:32.899 --> 15:34.565
in front of the customers.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.501
Seriously?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.936
- In front of the customers?
- Not hard.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.672
But still, uh, demeaning.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.006
- Yeah, I'll say.
- Yeah.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.408
{bleep}.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.543
He said
it was under-seasoned?

15:45.578 --> 15:47.812
- Over-seasoned?
- Under-seasoned.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.848
- Really? Which?
- Everything.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.451
Wow.
Where's Lisa?

15:53.486 --> 15:56.220
I will grab her for you
right away, Mr. Gordon.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.822
And grab Jonathan, too, as well,
will you, please?

15:57.857 --> 15:59.357
And anybody else
in the kitchen, please.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.725
(Val)
Okay.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.328
- Excuse me, Lisa, Jonathan.
- Yes?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.729
Can we meet up in front
with Gordon?

16:04.764 --> 16:07.231
That's the most edible thing
in here.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.337
Right.
Ooh, la.

16:12.372 --> 16:16.574
First impressions--
I look outside, historic inn.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.243
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> you've misspelled that.</i>

16:19.279 --> 16:21.779
It's "prehistoric."
Everything's so dated.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.681
I go up to the room,
and the room's shoddy.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.717
Jonathan, do you not think
it's a bit weird

16:25.752 --> 16:27.785
that, A, my door's open
adjacent to your bedroom,

16:27.821 --> 16:31.990
but your wife's clothes
are in my closet?

16:32.025 --> 16:34.592
I never thought of it that way,
but I guess that is odd.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.860
(Lisa)
It's weird.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.695
That was shocking.

16:37.731 --> 16:38.963
You just served me

16:38.999 --> 16:41.399
one of the worst lunches
I've ever eaten.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.937
And it was that bad, I started
eating the edible flowers.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.473
You can't be proud of what you
just served me and charged me.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.742
No, absolutely not.
Absolutely not. You're correct.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.777
You clearly have given up.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.579
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

16:54.614 --> 16:57.482
It tastes like it,
and it feels like it.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.883
What do you think
we should do?

16:58.918 --> 17:01.686
Close, because your heart's
not in it.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.289
And I think your head's
just in with the clouds.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.624
Embarrassing.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.029
Pretty [bleep] awful.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.368
It sucked.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.370
Caught me
off guard completely.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.939
I mean,
you knew he was coming.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.008
I did.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.980
Really embarrassing.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.550
[voice breaking] I really
thought we tried harder and...

17:38.591 --> 17:40.425
I let you down.
I'm sorry.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.560
- You did let me down.
- I'm really sorry.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.932
I always try to tell you
that we need to change things

17:47.967 --> 17:49.634
and we need
to make them sexier,

17:49.669 --> 17:51.536
and you never want
to listen to me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.438
[crying]

17:53.473 --> 17:55.106
I've always wanted to change,

17:55.141 --> 17:58.009
and you always say
I'm too random, and it's not.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.010
I'm not random.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.545
I'm trying to show you ideas

18:00.580 --> 18:03.414
and things
that we could do differently.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.384

18:20.467 --> 18:22.500

It hurts so much.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.135
Never gonna be able

18:24.170 --> 18:26.504
Oh, God.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.039
Don't worry about it.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.041
We'll be fine.
We'll figure something out.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.143
He doesn't [bleep] listen
to me, does he?

18:32.178 --> 18:35.746
Oh, that feels so good.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.148
I'm not really that upset.

18:37.183 --> 18:40.051

18:50.563 --> 18:52.130
Wow.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.632
Look at this.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.434
My God.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.670
Some really expensive stuff.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.105
This is crazy.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.708
I can't believe
how much stock there is here.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.811
It's like they're spending their
money in all the wrong places.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.147
Look at that.
This place goes on and on.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.851
Oh, my God.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.787
"Please shower before entering
the mineral spa."

19:16.823 --> 19:18.856
Mineral spa.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.526
Oh, my God.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.096
This place is like a dungeon--

19:25.131 --> 19:27.665
a dungeon for swingers.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.067
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> Tonight is crucial</i>

19:30.103 --> 19:32.603
<i>because I need to get my eyes</i>
<i> on how Jonathan and Lisa</i>

19:32.639 --> 19:34.172
<i> are running the hotel,</i>

19:34.207 --> 19:36.774

<i> to be on different pages.</i>

19:36.809 --> 19:38.543
Can I get you beverages
to start with?

19:38.578 --> 19:39.844
We're getting some wine.

19:39.879 --> 19:43.814
Okay, I was thinking cosmos,
but wine is great.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.216
There's so much stuff in here.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.884
I've never seen a kitchen
so cluttered.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.586
It's been worse,
believe it or not.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.688
(Gordon)
How come the food
just sits there?

19:50.723 --> 19:54.158
Right at the moment, our timing
is really not at all good.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.061
- What are these for, Jonathan?
- Those are little pre-meals.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.996
Little crackers,
little piece of cheese.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.598
(Gordon)
Pre-meals.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.133
Can I give that to you
to get rid of, please?

20:02.168 --> 20:03.267
Uh, to get rid of?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.236
- Yeah, i.e. trash.
- Oh.

20:05.271 --> 20:09.740
You can't serve that on bits
of paper for customers to eat.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.310
You can't ask them to dip
into a [bleep] doily

20:12.345 --> 20:14.312
with a cracker
and then a flower.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.280
Mmm. Yum, yum, yum, yum.
It's just--

20:16.316 --> 20:18.249
No, it's a bit [bleep] up.
Do you know what I mean?

20:18.284 --> 20:20.585
It's not your place,
but it's just a bit weird.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.989
[exhales deeply]

20:25.024 --> 20:26.991
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.192
I'm okay.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.660
When were the chickens roasted?

20:29.696 --> 20:30.728
Two days ago.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.763
That's the last of them.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.732
Why do we roast them
two days in advance?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.234
They're delivered
twice a week.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.069
They're cooked up
the delivery day.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.770
What kind of impression

20:39.806 --> 20:41.939
do you think you're sending out
to your customers

20:41.975 --> 20:43.874
when that chicken's roasted
two days before they come?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.843
I-I-I...

20:53.586 --> 20:55.820
When do you think
this chicken was roasted?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.154
- You ordered it--
- Oh, my goodness.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.589
I hope it was today.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.191
It was roasted
2 1/2 days ago.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.361
I am not happy
to hear that at all.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.229
That was gonna be dry
as a dog's bone.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.998
But anyway, try to enjoy.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.799
- Okay, thanks.
- I don't feel well anymore.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.701
Thank you.
I will try.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.803
They've been coming
for 12 years.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.906
You need to seriously just focus
on getting this night done.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.208
<i>And they sit there</i>
<i>all schmuck.</i>

21:17.243 --> 21:19.277
<i>I want to kick them out</i>
<i>right now.</i>

21:19.312 --> 21:20.911
Do you want us
to take the food back?

21:20.947 --> 21:23.180
I mean, this is,
like, so disappointing

21:23.216 --> 21:24.282
that you guys feel this way.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.983
I thought we were friends,

21:26.019 --> 21:27.652
and I thought
you would've maybe told us

21:27.687 --> 21:29.120
if you felt the food sucked
that much, you know?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.022
It's really--
Gosh, I feel--

21:31.057 --> 21:33.157
I feel like I want
to pass out right now.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.159
[bleep] hell.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.827
Um, so...

21:36.863 --> 21:39.196
The lady you were just talking
to over there had no idea

21:39.232 --> 21:41.866
her chicken was roasted
2 1/2 days ago.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.168
- It was roasted 2 1/2 days ago?
- Yeah.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.204
I didn't know that.
I mean, it's not my business--

21:47.240 --> 21:50.174
No, just--God, you two
are so defensive.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.743
There's 1,000 different ways
to make spaetzle.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.945
I'd like to--
I'm talking about the chicken.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.347
I'd love to find out
the proper way.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.215
Chicken, I'm talking to you
about the chicken.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.817
Yeah, well...

21:59.852 --> 22:01.752
Make an excuse again.

22:01.788 --> 22:02.920
- Nothing--
- Got to focus on--

22:02.955 --> 22:04.322
Nothing resonates with you,
does it?

22:04.357 --> 22:06.424
It certainly does.
Absolutely, it all does.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.760
What...

22:09.796 --> 22:11.062
in the hell?

22:11.097 --> 22:13.698
Ah, I just wanted
to keep it together tonight.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.199
That's all.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.734
[laughing]

22:16.769 --> 22:18.336
Ah, crazy.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.837
Are you, like, manic
or something?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.940
I'm manic.
Yes, I am right now.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.342
How's it going, guys?

22:24.377 --> 22:26.277
Something between
[bleep] and awful.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.079
What does it mean

22:28.114 --> 22:29.914
when it feels like an elephant's
sitting on your chest?

22:29.949 --> 22:31.816
Oh, you don't have a heart.
You can't have a heart attack.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.384
(Jonathan)
Are you hungry, Gordon?

22:33.419 --> 22:34.952
What is this?

22:37.757 --> 22:40.057
That is bacon.
Should be on a different shelf.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.392
And this here?

22:41.427 --> 22:44.362
That shouldn't
be thrown there either.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.198
What's that?

22:47.233 --> 22:48.766
Beer batter
for the beer-battered shrimp.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.135
That should be thrown out.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.037
And this one?
Let me just set that on top.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.305
Sure, put it right on top.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.173
What is all this?

22:59.011 --> 23:01.379
That was...

23:01.414 --> 23:02.480
bacon.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.415
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.850
Why is it in the fridge
like this?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.052
I dropped it one shelf below.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.254
Instead of putting it where it
belongs, I put it on the corner.

23:10.289 --> 23:12.056
Normally these things
are pretty orderly.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.292
This is a complete
cluster[bleep].

23:15.328 --> 23:16.460
And what's that?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.796
Corned beef.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.297
Let's get outside.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.500
Lisa, let's go outside.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.135
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:24.170 --> 23:25.836
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>What is going on?</i>

23:25.872 --> 23:28.272
The whole operation is screwed.

23:28.307 --> 23:31.876
The kitchen, shocking.
The line, disaster.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.578
Cross-contaminated,
raw meat, cooked meat--

23:34.614 --> 23:36.280
[bleep] everywhere.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.416
And then the biggest asset
where all the money is

23:38.451 --> 23:40.584
is downstairs
in the wine cellar.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.154
Who's maintaining
standards here?

23:43.189 --> 23:44.755
He is.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.224
I cannot believe
what you've just done in there.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.026
I really enjoy it.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.262
- You can't enjoy that.
- I swear to God, I do.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.997
I must be, like, cuckoo
in the head or something.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.098
Well, you need help.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.133
- Maybe.
- He does.

23:56.169 --> 23:57.835
You need to wake up.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.840
[bleep].

24:06.212 --> 24:08.345
I think we can do this.
I know we can do this.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.981
Yeah, but not
just you and you.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.450
I want it to be you and I,

24:12.485 --> 24:15.052
because you so don't listen
to me most of the time.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.421
Like, when I tell you, "It's
time to come home, Jonathan.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.223
It's time to [bleep]
come to bed."

24:19.258 --> 24:21.091
And you just say,
"[bleep] you."

24:21.127 --> 24:24.595
You know, [bleep] you now.
[bleep] you, Jonathan.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.164
[crying]
I love you so much,
and you're such a great guy,

24:27.200 --> 24:29.166
but you suck
as a business partner.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.402
- You really suck.
- Thanks.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.437
So you want to re-create this.
You want to--

24:33.473 --> 24:35.306
Get divorced.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.107
I don't want to get divorced.
You want to get divorced?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.442
No, I don't want
to get divorced.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.411
Why has it always been
your way?

24:40.446 --> 24:42.413
'Cause you know more than me?

24:42.448 --> 24:44.048
Apparently I don't.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.117
I'm as stupid as you think I am,
if not worse.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.819
(Lisa)
[sighs] Thank God.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.554
Let's go in the back door.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.324
(Jonathan)
[sighs] [bleep].

24:53.359 --> 24:54.992
Okay, give me a drink.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.294
I couldn't get this down
fast enough.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.331
That looks pretty good.
All right.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.500
[bottles clinking]

25:02.535 --> 25:06.937
- Have a nice night.
- [laughs]

25:06.973 --> 25:08.205
Ahh.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.074
(Melissa)
It's gonna be okay.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.209
Thanks for being
on the other side.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.611
Appreciate it.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.614
[coughs]
Oh, sorry.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.016
[coughing]

25:19.051 --> 25:20.885
That bourbon
was really strong.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.353
[coughing]

25:22.388 --> 25:25.122
Crap.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.390
Crying again?

25:26.425 --> 25:28.459
It's not really crying.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.128
- It's just releasing.
- Release it.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.030
Lisa, can I have you and him
together, please?

25:33.065 --> 25:34.365
Sure.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.570
I'm unconvinced,

25:39.605 --> 25:42.540
and I've never met a couple
so undeserving of my time.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.910
And I think you, Lisa--
you're just faking it.

25:45.945 --> 25:49.179
I'm just trying--trying to get
through the night tonight.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.981
No, you're acting.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.217
The crocodile tears are there.
Next minute's a laugh.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.019
It's self-preservation.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.354
And it's the only way for me
to get through the day.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.023
There's no heart.
There's no feeling.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.591
- There's a lot of heart
- No, there's not.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.593
I love what I do.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.995
And what do you love--
drinking with your friends?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.397
I don't do much drinking.

26:06.432 --> 26:09.466
I'm not the party girl.
He's the party boy.

26:09.502 --> 26:12.269
So there's no parties way on
after service downstairs

26:12.305 --> 26:14.438
in the basement
with the customers?

26:14.473 --> 26:16.674
Not in the past,
like, ten years.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.143
Jonathan,
you've lost interest.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.678
I'm a mess.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.380
(Lisa)
Yeah, you are.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.717
So the first thing I want you
both to do is to pack a bag.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.719
I want you to get out of here.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.187
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:30.222 --> 26:31.655
Start packing.

26:36.228 --> 26:39.663
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:39.699 --> 26:42.266
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>After sending Lisa and Jonathan</i>
<i> away for the night,</i>

26:42.301 --> 26:44.234
<i> I'm hoping</i>
<i> they can start to realize</i>

26:44.270 --> 26:46.437
<i> the effects they are having</i>
<i> on the Vienna.</i>

26:46.472 --> 26:49.306
<i> But before they return,</i>
<i> I called a staff meeting...</i>

26:49.342 --> 26:50.541
Morning.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.376
- Good morning.
- Morning.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.211
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> So I can get</i>
<i> a better understanding</i>

26:54.246 --> 26:58.482
<i> of the damage that</i>
<i>Lisa and Jonathan are doing.</i>

26:58.517 --> 27:00.250
I didn't get a chance
to meet you yesterday.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.386
I'm Jamie.
Do the housekeeping here.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.121
Okay, great.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.556
Let's get one thing right.
I'm here to help.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.124
Having done my research,

27:07.159 --> 27:09.727
I mean, the one
positive feedback I've had

27:09.762 --> 27:11.395
is about how good
the staff are,

27:11.430 --> 27:13.464
'cause I know, you know,
just how bad things are,

27:13.499 --> 27:15.332
and having witnessed
that service last night,

27:15.368 --> 27:16.634
I'm appalled.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.801
Is it always like that?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.036
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.704
- Screaming?
- Yes.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.740
People can hear them
in the dining room.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.175
I've had tables
that have asked

27:25.211 --> 27:27.044
if everything was okay
in the kitchen.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.813
We can't be expected
to be professional all the time

27:29.849 --> 27:31.682
when they're not professional.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.284
After our shift,
they'll sit down with a table

27:34.320 --> 27:37.554
and expect us to wait on them,
hand them drinks till midnight.

27:37.590 --> 27:39.323
If we leave, they get upset.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.091
So guests stay here,
and they're drinking downstairs

27:41.127 --> 27:43.093
in front of those guests,
sometimes with the guests.

27:43.129 --> 27:46.497
See, there's no separation
between business and personal.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.599
(man)
When you're sitting here
entertaining your table,

27:48.634 --> 27:51.201
she'll find something wrong
that you're doing,

27:51.237 --> 27:52.603
and she'll come
and point it at you

27:52.638 --> 27:54.071
right in front of your table.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.639
(Jamie)
She's just rude.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.175
She texts me sometimes
really rude text messages like,

27:58.210 --> 28:00.310
"Oh, you forgot this,"
or, "You forgot that,"

28:00.346 --> 28:02.079
or, "Why didn't you do this?"

28:02.114 --> 28:04.248
- And, "Why wasn't this done?"
- It's crazy.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.649
(man)
Another problem
that we've really been having

28:05.685 --> 28:07.251
is we don't have
an actual payroll system.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.852
There's no payroll system?

28:08.888 --> 28:10.754
And then they'll say,
"Yeah, I'll get you one."

28:10.790 --> 28:13.090
- And you just never...
- Asking for your salary?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.625
Yeah, we have to ask
for our checks.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.260
"Yeah, I got--
I got 20 bucks right now.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.162
"That's all I got right now.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.530
Tomorrow morning I'll see you."

28:19.565 --> 28:22.132
They're drip-feeding
your salaries.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.600
My bank
does not take the checks.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.169
Neither does mine.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.503
When was the last time

28:26.539 --> 28:27.838
you had a staff meeting
and discussed this?

28:27.873 --> 28:29.573
(all)
Never.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.575
I'm sorry, but I want
to put an end to all this.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.043
Here's what we're gonna do.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.080
They're arriving
any minute now.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.182
And my message to them is,
if they're not prepared

28:38.217 --> 28:41.085
to bring in a level
of professionalism

28:41.120 --> 28:43.687
and understand those boundaries
need to be met on a daily basis,

28:43.723 --> 28:46.557
they're gonna lose the inn,
and they're gonna lose you.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.593
Let me go and get them.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.662
I let myself continue
to be abused.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.831
<i> They need to know</i>
<i> that it has to change.</i>

28:53.866 --> 28:57.434
And it can't just
be brushed off anymore.

28:57.470 --> 28:58.869
I had a chat
with the team.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.105
They're not
in a good place.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.473
And you've abused them.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.242
There are no boundaries.
They're your staff.

29:05.277 --> 29:08.412
And they need to be treated
a certain way.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.781
Let's go to Jamie first.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.616
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:12.651 --> 29:15.519
I'm really concerned about the
abusive texts that you send him.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.454
Why would you send him
abusive texts?

29:17.490 --> 29:19.389
You would send me a picture,
like, "Oh, you forgot this,"

29:19.425 --> 29:20.858
or, "You didn't do this right."

29:20.893 --> 29:22.860
You told me that you worked
at a lot of other places

29:22.895 --> 29:24.561
and you knew how to clean,

29:24.597 --> 29:26.430
and then the toilets
aren't cleaned and stuff.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.765
It's really important.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.666
But some of that stuff
doesn't work.

29:29.702 --> 29:31.368
So it's, like,
I'm sitting there scrubbing,

29:31.403 --> 29:32.669
and nothing's coming up,
and you'll be like,

29:32.705 --> 29:34.505
"Well, go do it again."

29:34.540 --> 29:37.841
And it's like,
I'm trying to do what I can.

29:37.877 --> 29:42.546
None of these talented
individuals get paid on time.

29:42.581 --> 29:46.383
I want to know why
they don't get paid on time.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.520
Because I don't have a payroll
system in place right now.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.289
Well, that's
a [bleep] disgrace.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.658
That is disgusting.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.460
And then you want them
waiting on you

29:56.495 --> 29:58.729
up until all hours
of the early morning

29:58.764 --> 30:00.798
while they tidy up
after your crap

30:00.833 --> 30:04.701
and then you can't even be
bothered to pay them on time.

30:04.737 --> 30:06.970
It's a...
it's a mess.

30:07.006 --> 30:10.440
No, you are a mess.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.342
(Lisa)
I need to say
something, though--

30:12.378 --> 30:14.978
that almost every single person
here, we've given them loans.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.513
You're lending them money
to buy uniforms

30:16.549 --> 30:18.315
to work
in your [bleep] business.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.917
- Right.
- That's absurd?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.685
- Why?
- Why?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.654
Absurd to pay for a uniform?

30:23.689 --> 30:25.956
The business should be
providing the uniform.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.558
Well, maybe
we need to do that.

30:27.593 --> 30:28.759
Yes, you do.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.627
I never thought about it
that way.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.729
- Whose business is this?
- [sighs]

30:32.765 --> 30:36.366
(Jonathan)
I've tried to create here
a place where people can come

30:36.402 --> 30:38.669
and...

30:38.704 --> 30:42.706
and relax and escape
from their stressful lives.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.808
"Escape from their
stressful lives"

30:44.844 --> 30:47.611
to hear you and Lisa
scream at each other?

30:47.646 --> 30:50.480
Are you [bleep]
kidding me?

30:50.516 --> 30:53.917
We don't always scream at each
other, but when we do--

30:53.953 --> 30:55.752
Look how small this place is.

30:55.788 --> 30:59.723
You live here, so you've got no
idea how many times you do it.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.892
The love, affection,

31:01.927 --> 31:05.095
and respect that they've shown
you is extraordinary.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.397
And the sad news is...

31:07.433 --> 31:09.633
you both don't deserve it.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.101
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:11.136 --> 31:13.036
(Jonathan)
I'm sorry.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.471
I will change.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.908
I just hope you guys
want to continue.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.912
I just want to say thank you
for your honesty,

31:21.947 --> 31:23.413
loyalty.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.815
There's some other
important people

31:24.850 --> 31:26.450
I want to introduce you to
this morning.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.684
Thank you.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.785
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.621
[voice breaking]
Thank you, guys.

31:30.656 --> 31:37.761
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:37.796 --> 31:39.096
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.664
- Morning.
- Good morning.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.466
So, Lisa and Jonathan,

31:42.501 --> 31:45.335
I've asked
some ex-customers,

31:45.371 --> 31:49.673
locals, to come
and give you some feedback.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.408
Has anybody stayed there
recently?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.744
We did.
The room we stayed in--

31:53.779 --> 31:56.113
it had tools and screws...

31:56.148 --> 31:58.081
- and instruction manuals.
- Lightbulbs.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.716
Wow.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.485
So it's not just me.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.020
For the air conditioners
and stuff, yeah.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.888
That's right.
You're right.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.757
Madame, give us an insight
to your experience, please.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.960
I do have to say,
my husband ordered scallops,

32:09.995 --> 32:11.662
and they were raw.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.630
We returned them.

32:13.666 --> 32:16.500
The decor was very outdated,
and it feels very cluttered.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.402
You feel like you're locked
in a closet.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.836
It's just overwhelming

32:19.872 --> 32:21.605
when you're trying
to have a nice dinner.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.641
I would never come back there
if things don't change.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.209
Okay.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.878
What do you guys think
about the uniforms?

32:27.913 --> 32:29.079
It's a bit much.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.715
The poor ladies
were kind of revealing.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.685
Our server
was the nicest person,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.920
but I think it takes
a lot away from them.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.789
It doesn't need to be
in your face.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.792
The reputation locally
is crucial.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.460
What have you guys heard?

32:43.495 --> 32:46.463
I've heard that it's
a swingers' hangout.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.099
(woman)
I heard that as well.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.134
When I had mentioned
the Vienna, they say,

32:51.170 --> 32:53.704
"That's where
the swingers go."

32:53.739 --> 32:55.672
You eat downstairs,

32:55.708 --> 33:00.510
and then you go upstairs
is what I was told.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.746
But you've heard this before?

33:02.781 --> 33:05.849
- We've heard it for 13 years.
- I've heard it on the street.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.617
But is this due
to your late-night drinking

33:07.653 --> 33:09.453
- and the partying?
- I don't think so.

33:12.024 --> 33:15.192
But what I'm trying to say is
that there are no boundaries.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.593
It's an oasis down there

33:16.628 --> 33:19.629
that has got a Jacuzzi,
a massage table,

33:19.665 --> 33:24.134
and if the word has gotten out
around town and then--

33:24.169 --> 33:26.937
People misunderstood that room,
and that's where it all started.

33:26.972 --> 33:30.073
I'm just saying,
it's either a business,

33:30.109 --> 33:31.508
or it's your home.

33:31.543 --> 33:32.976
There's no crossover.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.178
The mixed messages
you're sending

33:35.214 --> 33:38.048
is your own fault
'cause you haven't been clear.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.517
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:40.552 --> 33:43.453
I used to come to the restaurant
probably every month or so,

33:43.489 --> 33:45.589
and I can tell

33:45.624 --> 33:48.225
you have a lot of, like,
passion for your heritage,

33:48.260 --> 33:51.094
but it's not
in the food anymore.

33:51.130 --> 33:55.599
If Gordon can help you
take your heritage and the food

33:55.634 --> 33:57.868
and modernize it
and you can progress with that,

33:57.903 --> 33:59.036
I'll come every Friday.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.104
Mark my words.
It's a promise.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.241
Do you have anything to say,
both of you, to these guests?

34:04.276 --> 34:06.910
Thank you so much
for your honesty and input

34:06.945 --> 34:08.245
and...

34:08.280 --> 34:10.047
really, really
appreciate it.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.983
We're gonna be making
some big changes

34:13.018 --> 34:16.553
to address many of the things
you talked about.

34:16.588 --> 34:19.990
The staff have been
incredibly loyal.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.258
They haven't been treated

34:21.293 --> 34:23.093
the way they
should have been treated.

34:23.128 --> 34:26.797
I'm undecided about these two,
but I am committed to that team,

34:26.832 --> 34:29.566
'cause I see what is at stake

34:29.601 --> 34:32.702
and the jeopardy they face
going forward.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.772
Now I've got something else
important to sort out.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.612
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> After leaving</i>
<i> Jonathan and Lisa,</i>

34:42.648 --> 34:45.549
<i>I moved forward with my plans</i>
<i> to help renovate the inn.</i>

34:45.584 --> 34:47.284
<i> I brought in</i>
<i> sommelier Dave Foss</i>

34:47.319 --> 34:48.919
<i> to create</i>
<i> a beverage program...</i>

34:48.954 --> 34:51.021
Just have a look in here.
I mean...

34:51.056 --> 34:53.223
That wine's fantastic.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.325
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>From the excessive inventory</i>
<i> they weren't using.</i>

34:55.360 --> 34:57.194
'03.
Oh, that's delicious.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.296
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> My team worked</i>
<i> up to the last minute</i>

34:59.331 --> 35:02.099
<i>transforming the many spaces</i>
<i> at the Vienna.</i>

35:02.134 --> 35:03.834
- Wow.
- Oh-ho.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.635
- Wow.
- That is amazing.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.737
Holy smokes.

35:07.773 --> 35:11.808
- This is beautiful.
- This is incredible.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.176
Bravo.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.212
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>The Vienna had no organization</i>

35:15.247 --> 35:17.347
<i> for managing</i>
<i>their day-to-day operations.</i>

35:17.382 --> 35:19.816
<i> So I gave them</i>
<i> a state-of-the-art system</i>

35:19.852 --> 35:22.586
<i> to help with all</i>
<i>their hotel operational needs.</i>

35:22.621 --> 35:25.822
Welcome
to the WebRezPro system.

35:25.858 --> 35:28.091
And this will help transform
your business.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.260
It will link up
to the POS system,

35:30.295 --> 35:32.963
and it will give you data
like you've never had before.

35:32.998 --> 35:33.997
Fabulous.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.932
You need to be organized,

35:35.968 --> 35:39.302
from the inventories
to the wage costs

35:39.338 --> 35:41.838
to the salaries
to the POS systems

35:41.874 --> 35:45.342
to the checking-in
and the checking-out system.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.145
And the good news--
guests can now book online.

35:48.180 --> 35:52.716
So this should relieve
a huge headache.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.784
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> I could see that everyone</i>
<i> was thrilled</i>

35:54.820 --> 35:56.086
<i>with the changes at the Vienna.</i>

35:56.121 --> 35:58.121
Good.
Have a good look round.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.723
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> But as I watched Lisa...</i>

35:59.758 --> 36:01.858
Where's this stuff from?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.927
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>I noticed she was dissatisfied</i>
<i> with the renovations.</i>

36:03.962 --> 36:07.230
These are different chairs from
the other ones, aren't they?

36:07.266 --> 36:10.133
I was just seeing
if it was 100% cotton.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.701
Is that a pull-out?

36:11.737 --> 36:13.970
No, it doesn't need to be
a pull-out.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.973
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> And right now I'm worried</i>
<i> where Lisa's head is,</i>

36:17.009 --> 36:19.776
<i> going into relaunch</i>
<i> this evening.</i>

36:19.811 --> 36:26.383
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

36:26.418 --> 36:28.618
Good evening!

36:28.654 --> 36:30.887
(David)
I can help you with your bags.
First let's get you checked in.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.923
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i>While it was time to relaunch</i>
<i> the inn and restaurant...</i>

36:32.958 --> 36:34.724
- Little more modern.
- Yep.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.726
We have an order.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.929
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> I provided the staff</i>
<i> with brand-new uniforms</i>

36:38.964 --> 36:40.664
<i> that go with</i>
<i> the new updated menu</i>

36:40.699 --> 36:42.966
<i> that includes wine pairing</i>
<i> and beer flights.</i>

36:43.001 --> 36:44.734
First is going to be
the grapefruit,

36:44.770 --> 36:46.970
then the second
is going to be the pilsner.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.172
- These are up here.
- Please get out of here, Lisa.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.708
Off the line.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.743
Actually,
I'll just turn this lamp on.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.812
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

36:55.847 --> 36:57.681
No lightbulb.
[chuckles]

36:57.716 --> 36:59.716
Oops.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.951
(Lisa)
Excuse me.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.085
(Gordon)
What's wrong?

37:02.120 --> 37:03.353
(Lisa)
No lightbulb in there.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.222
Don't worry about it.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.957
Who's complaining
about the lightbulb?

37:06.992 --> 37:09.125
Oh, just making sure
that they have enough light.

37:09.161 --> 37:11.027
Trying to turn it on,
then realized it later.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.896
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.497
Let's focus on the big things.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.866
Are you always like this
over little details like that?

37:16.902 --> 37:19.836
I like to have things
feel right, and so...

37:19.871 --> 37:21.738
I'm feeling extra--
like, an extra need

37:21.773 --> 37:23.707
to make sure everything's
right--that's all.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.242
- OTT.
- Just a fusser.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.344
- OTT.
- Probably.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.412
- Whatever that means.
- Over the top.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.248
- [chuckles]
- Over the top.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.149
I guess I don't have to be
so over the top now, do I?

37:33.185 --> 37:34.884
You do not.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.087
[bleep].

37:41.793 --> 37:43.893
What is wrong
with her tonight?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.929
Do you think she's gonna go back
to her old ways when I leave?

37:45.964 --> 37:47.831
<i> (Melissa)</i>
<i> She might accidentally.</i>

37:47.866 --> 37:50.033
Customer's coming.
Welcome.

<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> While Lisa is nitpicking</i>
<i> everything unnecessarily...</i>

37:52.404 --> 37:55.005
(Jessica)
Do you guys have the appetizer
for table five?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.172
- Oh, sorry.
- We didn't give you that yet?

37:56.208 --> 37:57.474
No, you didn't.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.309
- No?
- No.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.244
<i> (Gordon)</i>
<i> Jonathan is lost</i>
<i> in the kitchen,</i>

38:01.280 --> 38:03.513
<i> and service is starting</i>
<i> to suffer.</i>

38:03.548 --> 38:05.248
What table number's this,
please?

38:05.284 --> 38:06.516
That is table number 11.

38:06.551 --> 38:07.984
They're waiting
on two flank steaks.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.886
Where's the flank steak?
Are they coming?

38:09.921 --> 38:12.289
Moments. Moments.
Minutes.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.024
Who's cooking the flank steak?

38:14.059 --> 38:16.426
Come on, guys, we can do one
four-top at the same time, yes?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.862
I designed the menu
around the size of the kitchen,

38:18.897 --> 38:21.064
the speed of both you
working together, okay?

38:21.099 --> 38:23.833
[bleep].
Flanks are going.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.502
Come back for the flank.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.003
What the hell is this?

38:27.039 --> 38:28.505
Look at me,
both of you, both of you.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.940
Cut the [bleep], okay?
Look at me.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.809
You're more than capable of
doing four [bleep] main courses

38:32.844 --> 38:34.010
at the same time,

38:34.046 --> 38:35.378
especially when
there's two of you.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.847
And one of those main courses
is the same dish.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.516
We got to talk to each other,
but I'm not gonna start sending

38:39.551 --> 38:41.251
one dish at a time
for a four-top.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.385
- Serious?
- Doesn't matter.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.889
It doesn't matter at all.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.524
Jonathan, hey, look at me.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.359
I need some [bleep] effort
from you a little bit.

38:49.394 --> 38:50.827
I need a little bit
of respect,

38:50.862 --> 38:52.062
a little bit of effort
from you, okay?

38:52.097 --> 38:53.496
Yeah, and look at me.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.198
You're the man holding
this [bleep] thing together.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.200
If you go down, the whole
[bleep] place is gonna go down.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.036
I need you to step up, okay?
I need you to talk a little bit.

39:00.072 --> 39:03.006
And I want four main courses
at the same [bleep] time.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.140
- Oh, dear God.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.208
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

39:05.243 --> 39:06.476
You can get your mind
set around

39:06.511 --> 39:12.315
four main courses
at the same [bleep] time.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.284
one table at a time,

39:14.319 --> 39:16.119
and we're gonna complete
that table,

39:16.154 --> 39:18.988
four main courses, three main
courses, five main courses.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.223
We're gonna talk together.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.658
Sausage goes with what--
the two soups?

39:21.693 --> 39:22.959
What's coming next?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.627
It's gonna be sausage,

39:24.663 --> 39:26.429
two carrot soups,
and a fried cheese.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.131
- Good.
- For table seven.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.299
Okay, so we're talking now.

39:29.334 --> 39:30.500
- Yep.
- Good.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.068
- Carrot?
- Thank you very much.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.636
I have your flank steaks.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.206
Your wine is coming
right away, okay?

39:36.241 --> 39:37.340
Your sausage.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.942
You guys
are all sharing, right?

39:38.977 --> 39:40.210
- Yes.
- Yeah.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.611
<i> (Jessica)</i>
<i> I think the new Vienna</i>

39:41.646 --> 39:43.680
<i> will definitely attract</i>
<i> a younger crowd.</i>

39:43.715 --> 39:46.583
- Oh, my God.
- So beautiful.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.485
<i> (Jessica)</i>
<i> I'm super excited</i>
<i> about the new changes,</i>

39:48.520 --> 39:50.520

I really do.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.157
Right.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.625
We've had ups and downs,

39:55.660 --> 39:58.695
but tonight
is a prime example

39:58.730 --> 40:02.365
of how good and how profitable
this business can be.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.667
Customers loving the food.
They love the decor.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.003
I'm leaving you
with all the tools

40:07.038 --> 40:09.372
to get this place back
to where you want it to go.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.241
I do want to ask you
one thing.

40:11.276 --> 40:12.742
Sure.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.110
Is there anything
that's happened this week

40:14.146 --> 40:16.012
that you're not happy with?

40:16.047 --> 40:18.181
Yes, I had expected the Blumen's
room to be done, not the Koenig.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.216
It was the room
I didn't expect.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.019
And the room
that we've done...

40:23.054 --> 40:25.355
- Is amazing.
- Still has problems.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.457
Can I just tell you something
really important?

40:27.492 --> 40:29.492
- This is not a makeover show.
- I know that.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.227
- Yeah.
- But you're complaining about--

40:31.263 --> 40:33.029
I wasn't saying
I didn't love that room.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.064
It'd be a great shame for you
to sound ungrateful.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.200
Oh, I'm not ungrateful.
I am just so shocked--

40:37.235 --> 40:41.037
From the new management system
to Dave--

40:41.072 --> 40:42.639
I'm coming across wrong

40:42.674 --> 40:44.407
if you think
that I'm being ungrateful,

40:44.443 --> 40:45.742
'cause I'm really not.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.444
It sounds like that.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.379
No.
Not at all.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.080
I can't come in
and wave a magic wand

40:51.116 --> 40:53.483
and transform 15 bedrooms
and put a brand-new kitchen.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.285
You now know
what needs to happen.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.153
I do.

40:57.189 --> 40:59.422
But I need to tell you something
that you're not gonna like.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.358
- I arranged for a new stove...
- You did?

41:02.394 --> 41:04.194
To come,

41:04.229 --> 41:07.397
and then when I got the engineer
to come and survey the place,

41:07.432 --> 41:09.466
unfortunately,
he had to leave,

41:09.501 --> 41:11.701
because he was gonna shut
the place down,

41:11.736 --> 41:14.337
'cause there's practices
that are taking place in there

41:14.372 --> 41:15.672
that aren't appropriate.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.240
You're saying
the gas systems--

41:17.275 --> 41:18.741
The whole setup
underneath there.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.277
Nothing's been changed
in 13 years.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.581
And it's on the verge of
running illegally.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.217
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.152
Listen, I came here to help,

41:29.187 --> 41:32.055
but you need to help yourselves
and dig deep

41:32.090 --> 41:34.791
and stick together, okay?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.593
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.228
- Good luck.
- Okay.

- Thank you, Gordon.
- Okay.
