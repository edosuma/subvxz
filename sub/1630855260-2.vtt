00:03.049 --> 00:06.022
(somber piano music)

00:12.101 --> 00:15.040
(somber piano music)

00:16.644 --> 00:18.313
- [Interviewer] Thousands
of people looked up to you

00:18.346 --> 00:21.119
and followed you, but how can
they trust you're authentic?

00:23.724 --> 00:26.362
- I mean, I'm a tough
guy to ask that to,

00:26.396 --> 00:30.370
'cause I had obviously
some major lies and secrets

00:30.404 --> 00:33.644
that I was carrying for years.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.384
Nobody's meant to live
with lies, nobody.

00:38.588 --> 00:41.059
I think for me it
had run its course.

00:43.129 --> 00:45.300
People who grew up in our church

00:45.334 --> 00:47.137
with Laura and I
leading them, they say,

00:47.171 --> 00:49.275
"Okay, so Carl had
some areas in his life

00:49.308 --> 00:52.582
"where he wasn't
honest with anybody,

00:52.616 --> 00:55.454
"himself, with his
wife, with his church.

00:55.487 --> 00:59.496
"Does that mean everything
he preached isn't honest?"

00:59.529 --> 01:02.201
(somber music)

01:04.506 --> 01:07.444
If you are led by somebody,
you have to trust them,

01:07.478 --> 01:10.417
and I think the biggest breach,
one of the biggest breaches,

01:11.654 --> 01:15.662
my life, my situation
would've brought

01:15.695 --> 01:19.168
would've been a breach of
trust to thousands of people.

01:20.404 --> 01:22.107
Marriage, any married
people in here?

01:22.141 --> 01:23.343
We love you.

01:23.376 --> 01:26.517
Especially my wife
and my children,

01:27.752 --> 01:28.788
I failed at that,

01:30.792 --> 01:33.296
but Hillsong failed at that too.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.106
(somber music)

01:44.218 --> 01:46.757
(somber music)

01:53.169 --> 01:56.175
(somber music)

01:56.209 --> 01:59.516
(Laura chuckles nervously)

02:02.822 --> 02:06.229
(dramatic soul music)

02:09.435 --> 02:14.111
♪ I hope you find some peace
of mind in this lifetime ♪

02:20.758 --> 02:24.633
♪ I hope you find
some paradise ♪

02:27.839 --> 02:30.645
(dramatic music)

02:36.890 --> 02:39.663
(dramatic music)

02:45.942 --> 02:48.681
(dramatic music)

02:55.962 --> 02:59.235
(footsteps pattering)

02:59.970 --> 03:00.972
(papers slap)

03:01.005 --> 03:03.744
(Carl chuckles)

03:05.748 --> 03:08.420
(Carl grunts)

03:08.453 --> 03:10.591
- I haven't thought
about sermon stuff,

03:10.625 --> 03:12.194
you know, in a while.

03:14.298 --> 03:18.841
You don't forget how you felt,
why you wrote some of these.

03:20.277 --> 03:22.314
A message called
"The mask has to go."

03:23.651 --> 03:24.986
(Carl laughs)

03:25.020 --> 03:26.857
Gotta have your strength mask,

03:26.890 --> 03:28.561
so everybody knows
you could handle it.

03:28.594 --> 03:30.297
Gotta have your happy mask,

03:30.330 --> 03:32.635
so everybody will always
think you're having fun.

03:32.669 --> 03:34.405
Gotta have your sex appeal mask,

03:34.438 --> 03:36.710
after all, that's your value.

03:36.744 --> 03:40.317
All these masks are
designed to hide need.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.227
You need to face some of
the issues in your life,

03:45.260 --> 03:46.764
so others can face theirs.

03:48.366 --> 03:50.237
Yeah, this is heavy to read.

03:50.270 --> 03:51.540
It's, um...

03:52.509 --> 03:53.978
(tense music)

03:54.011 --> 03:56.517
You could only get
the help you need

03:56.550 --> 03:59.321
if you let down the
drawbridge of your life,

03:59.355 --> 04:03.263
and typically people like
me, the drawbridge stays up.

04:03.296 --> 04:04.365
In the back of your mind,
you're always going,

04:04.398 --> 04:06.804
"This is not gonna end well."

04:06.837 --> 04:09.743
You know when you go backwards
and you start finding out

04:09.776 --> 04:11.914
about how you ended up
places, you find out,

04:11.947 --> 04:14.351
wow, I've thought about
this day for a while.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.627
- All right, let's
consider our giving.

04:18.661 --> 04:20.665
Come up here, Carl,
come on, Carl.

04:20.698 --> 04:24.271
Carl Lentz, who is a college
student in Australia.

04:26.075 --> 04:28.814
- Fear, that's how my
preaching style developed.

04:28.848 --> 04:30.918
What's funny is I,

04:30.952 --> 04:33.791
I didn't know enough
about preaching to
have a style at all.

04:33.824 --> 04:34.860
- So come on, Carl.

04:35.995 --> 04:37.699
- How you doing?

04:37.732 --> 04:40.605
The first message
I ever preached,

04:40.638 --> 04:43.878
that was the first
time I learned the
power of desperation.

04:43.911 --> 04:46.683
Like I preached
like I was on fire.

04:46.717 --> 04:49.088
I basically like paced
a hole in the carpet,

04:49.121 --> 04:50.525
like I never stopped moving,

04:50.558 --> 04:52.027
and I didn't know
any other speed.

04:53.764 --> 04:57.004
I survived that night,
and I remember the lesson.

04:57.037 --> 05:00.611
You know, you're not always
gonna have it before the moment,

05:00.645 --> 05:02.882
but once you get in that
moment, if you trust God,

05:02.916 --> 05:04.553
he'll come through.

05:04.586 --> 05:06.389
Well you just gotta get on
your knees and get desperate.

05:06.422 --> 05:07.659
Get on your knees and say,

05:07.692 --> 05:08.794
"God, I want more
out of this life.

05:08.828 --> 05:10.430
"I want you to use me more.

05:10.463 --> 05:11.700
"I want you to give
me more passion.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.336
"I want you to
give me more fire.

05:13.369 --> 05:15.741
"I am desperate to go
from here to there.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.545
"Do something with me!"

05:17.579 --> 05:19.348
(crowd mutters)

05:19.381 --> 05:22.120
I was a good freaking speaker,
and I did it all the time,

05:22.154 --> 05:24.391
anywhere that I had to do it.

05:25.695 --> 05:27.364
Yes, New York is a challenge,

05:27.397 --> 05:30.638
but just like that, I always
saw it as an opportunity.

05:30.671 --> 05:32.407
(uptempo music)

05:32.441 --> 05:33.677
You know, Brian actually
told me, he said,

05:33.711 --> 05:35.781
"I picked you for this
'cause I know you'll try

05:35.815 --> 05:37.919
"to win this city one
by one if you have to."

05:39.421 --> 05:40.925
We wanted to reach lost people.

05:42.427 --> 05:44.766
We wanted to open up
the doors really wide.

05:46.068 --> 05:47.772
You know, pound the
fricking pavement.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.678
(uptempo music)

05:50.711 --> 05:53.116
If we're gonna reach New York
City, we gotta do it our way.

05:53.149 --> 05:56.088
It's not gonna be traditional,
it's not gonna be normal.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.792
(uptempo music)

05:57.825 --> 06:00.565
I remember waking Laura up
one night at like 2:00 AM,

06:00.598 --> 06:01.867
and I'm like, "Laura,
you gotta wrap,

06:01.900 --> 06:03.871
"you gotta wrap
these seven bibles."

06:03.904 --> 06:05.875
And me and my friend,
we're gonna go to the club,

06:05.908 --> 06:07.110
you know, I know the DJ,

06:07.144 --> 06:08.881
so we're gonna be
up in this DJ booth.

06:08.914 --> 06:10.050
She's like, "I gotta do what?

06:10.083 --> 06:12.020
"Like wrap bibles?"

06:12.054 --> 06:13.657
And so she wrapped
them in newspapers,

06:13.691 --> 06:14.626
and we like put
'em in our jackets,

06:14.659 --> 06:17.599
and go give these bibles
to people that I love,

06:17.632 --> 06:19.903
and we would do stuff
like that all the time.

06:19.936 --> 06:23.544
(uptempo music)

06:23.577 --> 06:25.013
Originally in 2010 we started

06:25.046 --> 06:26.583
with maybe two or
three services,

06:26.617 --> 06:29.656
and then quickly
probably went to four,

06:29.689 --> 06:32.629
and then after that we
went to five and six.

06:32.662 --> 06:34.866
You keep on believing,
you keep on fighting.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.536
Some of it wouldn't
even be planned.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.106
I remember one
service in particular,

06:38.139 --> 06:39.809
where it was the last
service of the day,

06:39.843 --> 06:42.481
it was like seven o'clock, and
there's 400 people outside.

06:43.784 --> 06:47.090
That's kind of how much
fun and crazy it was.

06:47.124 --> 06:50.965
(Carl preaching in the distance)

06:50.998 --> 06:54.004
We were reaching people that
had never been to church,

06:54.038 --> 06:57.077
or people who gave up on
all religion whatsoever,

06:57.110 --> 07:00.952
so it was a good problem.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.189
Anybody, take a
20-second praise break,

07:03.222 --> 07:04.960
and give God a shot of praise

07:04.993 --> 07:06.563
if he's done anything
in your life.

07:06.597 --> 07:09.034
(crowd cheers)

07:20.691 --> 07:22.027
- [Announcer] Hillsong
Australia presents

07:22.060 --> 07:24.131
Hills Leadership College.

07:24.164 --> 07:25.801
Not just another institution,

07:25.835 --> 07:28.039
but a unique ministry
training facility,

07:28.072 --> 07:30.778
part of a vital,
living, growing church.

07:30.811 --> 07:33.016
- The church that I see
is a church so committed

07:33.049 --> 07:36.489
to raising, training
and empowering a
leadership generation.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.463
(somber synth music)

07:41.933 --> 07:44.939
- Went to Hillsong Bible
College to like see the campus.

07:44.973 --> 07:47.645
This really cool surfer dude
rolls up in this big truck,

07:47.679 --> 07:48.146
and he's like, "Are
you new to college?"

07:48.179 --> 07:49.783
I'm like, "Yeah."

07:49.816 --> 07:50.951
He's like, "We're
gonna go to Maccas."

07:50.985 --> 07:52.187
I'm like, "What
the heck is Maccas,

07:52.220 --> 07:53.189
"like what are you
talking about?"

07:53.222 --> 07:54.693
Found out it was McDonald's,

07:54.726 --> 07:57.598
and then, like, that's
how I met Joel Houston.

07:59.101 --> 08:00.671
We were best friends
from that moment.

08:00.705 --> 08:03.109
(waves crashing)

08:03.142 --> 08:06.182
- I went to Hillsong College.

08:06.215 --> 08:08.219
I had never left
New York before.

08:10.591 --> 08:14.933
It was hard leaving, but
everyone around me was like,

08:14.966 --> 08:17.204
"God got you," and I'm
like, "Okay, God got me."

08:19.141 --> 08:20.711
All my friends pulled together

08:20.745 --> 08:22.247
and helped me
raise all the money

08:22.280 --> 08:24.485
that I needed for my semester.

08:25.855 --> 08:29.662
I left in hopes that I
would become a pastor.

08:32.602 --> 08:35.875
Hillsong College teaches you
about Hillsong leadership,

08:35.908 --> 08:39.516
how to run a Hillsong
service, and how to...

08:42.054 --> 08:43.690
I don't...

08:43.724 --> 08:45.193
Hillsong College didn't
really teach me much.

08:45.226 --> 08:47.799
(Tiff laughs)

08:49.602 --> 08:53.209
I was sitting and
listening to lecturers,

08:53.242 --> 08:56.817
but some of them didn't
have a degree to teach.

08:59.254 --> 09:00.223
It was not what I
thought it would be.

09:01.593 --> 09:04.098
(uptempo music)

09:05.768 --> 09:07.104
- When Carl was attending
college in Sydney,

09:07.137 --> 09:09.108
he first caught Brian's eye,

09:09.141 --> 09:11.713
and he handpicked
him as an assistant,

09:11.747 --> 09:13.249
and then eventually
as a protege.

09:14.786 --> 09:16.288
- Yeah, obviously,
just being around Joel

09:16.322 --> 09:17.992
means you're gonna be
around Brian and Bobbie,

09:18.025 --> 09:19.729
so you get to know 'em
in a different way.

09:19.763 --> 09:21.733
You know, literally
living at their house,

09:21.767 --> 09:24.739
and growing to love them
like another set of parents.

09:26.308 --> 09:28.279
The funny thing is, I was
never really good at school,

09:28.312 --> 09:30.283
I actually didn't like
it, but I was good.

09:30.316 --> 09:31.620
Bible college, I crushed it.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.122
I mean I loved the assignments,

09:33.156 --> 09:34.893
I loved the work,
and I loved learning

09:34.926 --> 09:37.565
about the stuff I've
always wondered about.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.608
- I remember one time the
Principal asked all the women

09:42.642 --> 09:47.083
to stay behind, and lecture
us about making sure

09:47.117 --> 09:49.656
that we weren't wearing things

09:49.689 --> 09:51.192
that would make our
brothers stumble.

09:51.225 --> 09:54.031
And I remember looking
around the room and I'm like,

09:54.064 --> 09:56.603
"I'm sorry, what?"

09:56.636 --> 09:59.909
- What a great thing to know
that you and I as followers

09:59.943 --> 10:03.082
of Christ aren't limited
by this natural world.

10:03.116 --> 10:06.790
(hands clapping)
(students cheering)

10:06.823 --> 10:08.192
- Father, I thank
you that we can brave

10:08.226 --> 10:09.963
every storm of our life.

10:09.996 --> 10:11.933
- In the case of Hillsong,

10:11.967 --> 10:16.643
you do have women in positions
of religious authority,

10:17.712 --> 10:20.350
but that doesn't
necessarily mean

10:20.383 --> 10:23.322
that you actually have equality.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.961
Even though you might
have a woman on stage,

10:25.995 --> 10:28.767
she will often be on
stage next to her husband

10:28.801 --> 10:30.838
in a kind of supporting role.

10:30.871 --> 10:34.378
- My beautiful bride of
nearly 22 years is gonna come

10:34.411 --> 10:36.382
and encourage us around
our giving this morning.

10:36.415 --> 10:38.219
Thanks, babe.
- Amen.

10:38.252 --> 10:40.223
- Look who I brought
up with me tonight.

10:40.256 --> 10:41.827
(crowd cheers)

10:41.860 --> 10:43.362
(pastor chuckles)

10:43.396 --> 10:45.366
- [Kristin] Women will
often be kind of directed

10:45.400 --> 10:47.370
to ministering to other women,

10:47.404 --> 10:50.811
but not necessarily the
Sunday morning services.

10:50.845 --> 10:53.684
(crowd applauding)

10:55.988 --> 10:58.226
- Amen, amen, amen.

10:58.259 --> 11:00.096
Hallelujah.

11:00.129 --> 11:02.702
- Bobbie Houston is Brian's
wife and often functioned

11:02.735 --> 11:05.006
as Brian for the
women of the church.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.143
There is a lot of
focus in Hillsong

11:07.177 --> 11:09.114
on the way women should
comport themselves

11:09.147 --> 11:11.218
in terms of the way they dress,

11:11.252 --> 11:14.726
the way they carry themselves,
the way they have sex.

11:14.759 --> 11:17.397
(dramatic music)

11:17.430 --> 11:20.704
And Bobbie in so many
cases was positioned,

11:20.738 --> 11:23.109
and positioned herself, as
the standard bearer of that.

11:24.444 --> 11:26.248
- Laura, much to smile
about in your life.

11:26.282 --> 11:28.052
You have three
beautiful children.

11:28.085 --> 11:31.760
Her children, her
husband, and even her God,

11:31.793 --> 11:33.730
will stand up and
give her praise,

11:33.764 --> 11:35.868
and that is the ending
that God wants you

11:35.901 --> 11:37.972
and I to experience as women.

11:38.005 --> 11:39.742
- I think all the
girls in the house

11:39.776 --> 11:42.380
should give all our
college boys a big cheer.

11:42.414 --> 11:44.719
We love you.
(cheering)

11:45.688 --> 11:49.027
- I did three years and
I was able to graduate.

11:49.061 --> 11:52.267
- [Announcer] Tiffany Perez
from the United States!

11:52.300 --> 11:55.406
- Knowing that Carl had also
gone to Hillsong College,

11:55.440 --> 11:57.177
just a few years before me,

11:57.210 --> 11:59.147
and also got the
same certificate,

11:59.181 --> 12:01.418
actually didn't mean much to me,

12:01.452 --> 12:03.957
because I am not a white man.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.863
I knew there was a ceiling
that I had to break, and,

12:09.167 --> 12:11.438
I thought I can break it.

12:11.472 --> 12:13.142
(cheering and
instruments blaring)

12:13.175 --> 12:15.346
- I was in college the
same year with Carl Lentz,

12:15.380 --> 12:17.450
with Joel Houston,
with Ben Houston.

12:17.484 --> 12:18.754
It was clear that they had

12:18.787 --> 12:20.323
a different experience
than we did.

12:20.356 --> 12:22.060
Joel and Ben Houston, you know,

12:22.093 --> 12:23.964
obviously they're in
the Houston family,

12:23.997 --> 12:24.599
we know that they're
gonna be headed

12:24.632 --> 12:25.801
for a leadership position,

12:25.834 --> 12:27.805
and then there was a group

12:27.838 --> 12:29.909
that was kind of
surrounding them,

12:29.943 --> 12:32.982
earmarked I think for
particular attention,

12:33.015 --> 12:36.055
closer mentorship,
things like that,

12:36.088 --> 12:39.061
that I don't think all the
students had access to.

12:39.094 --> 12:40.229
- But you've gotta
have the talent,

12:40.263 --> 12:42.067
you've gotta have the magnetism.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.774
You know, I'm sure when
Brian saw what Carl could do

12:45.808 --> 12:48.379
at his peak, why would
you not be overjoyed

12:48.412 --> 12:50.249
to have that in
your organization?

12:50.283 --> 12:52.487
(dramatic music)

12:52.521 --> 12:56.261
- Being from New York, "I
was like I could do this."

12:56.295 --> 12:58.800
Like, it's, I saw
it as a challenge.

13:00.370 --> 13:03.275
But I also understood that
there were younger generations

13:03.309 --> 13:06.382
that were going to eventually
see my face somewhere,

13:06.415 --> 13:09.488
and hope, "Hey,
Tiff looks like me.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.826
"If she can do it, I can do it."

13:11.860 --> 13:14.999
- God doesn't call
the qualified, he
qualifies the called.

13:15.033 --> 13:17.370
That's definitely
my least favorite,

13:17.404 --> 13:19.976
most triggering Hillsong phrase.

13:22.047 --> 13:25.486
Hillsong would tell
you God, God does it,

13:25.521 --> 13:29.862
but well I would say the
leadership of Hillsong calls

13:29.896 --> 13:31.800
and qualifies whoever they want.

13:36.141 --> 13:39.949
(pleasant piano music)

13:39.982 --> 13:42.153
- I grew up in Australia.

13:42.187 --> 13:44.525
(projector clicks)
(pleasant music)

13:44.559 --> 13:46.362
Just the best Aussie
upbringing ever.

13:48.332 --> 13:50.938
My parents were
really good friends

13:50.971 --> 13:53.009
with Brian and Bobbie Houston.

13:53.042 --> 13:57.450
(pleasant music)
(reel clicks)

13:57.484 --> 14:00.858
- I met Brian when I
was 15 years of age.

14:02.460 --> 14:05.634
- When Brian was starting the
Hillsong church in Australia,

14:05.667 --> 14:07.872
he asked Kevin to be the pastor

14:07.905 --> 14:10.878
of this new, fledgling church.

14:12.247 --> 14:13.416
- [Kevin] I mean,
I've got photographs

14:13.449 --> 14:15.888
of his oldest son, Joel.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.259
Laura's in nappies
and Joel's in nappies,

14:18.292 --> 14:20.396
so, you know, our kids
have grown up together

14:20.430 --> 14:22.033
with their kids.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.202
(projector clicks)

14:23.235 --> 14:25.073
- We actually all
thought we were related

14:25.106 --> 14:27.545
until our teenage years.

14:27.578 --> 14:31.285
Brian and Bobbie were like my
other parents, I would say.

14:31.318 --> 14:35.627
(pleasant music turns dramatic)

14:35.661 --> 14:39.201
Hillsong was, that was
my extended family.

14:41.038 --> 14:42.641
(projector whirs)

14:42.675 --> 14:46.482
- I first met Carl when
he arrived as a student.

14:48.285 --> 14:51.893
He brought so many
people to church.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.932
He would reserve rows of seats

14:54.966 --> 14:57.303
for people that he just met
when he was out and about.

14:57.337 --> 14:59.174
It was amazing.

14:59.207 --> 15:01.178
- Laura's mom was the
bible college principal,

15:01.211 --> 15:02.581
and so I would always
go into her office,

15:02.615 --> 15:04.886
and like pour out my
heart, like deep stuff.

15:06.255 --> 15:07.157
And then I end up
dating her daughter,

15:07.190 --> 15:09.495
it's kind of like, I
wish I wouldn't have let

15:09.529 --> 15:10.998
that cat out of the bag.

15:13.970 --> 15:18.647
(projector clicks)
(pleasant music)

15:20.416 --> 15:23.489
The first time I saw
Laura, I was like,

15:23.523 --> 15:26.361
that girl right
there is special.

15:26.395 --> 15:27.631
Called my Mom, I said,

15:27.665 --> 15:30.269
"Mom, I just saw the the
woman I'm gonna marry."

15:30.303 --> 15:32.474
- The first time
I met Carl Lentz,

15:32.508 --> 15:36.115
I had just come from the beach.

15:36.148 --> 15:37.450
- [Carl] I remember the
way her hair flicked,

15:37.484 --> 15:39.488
I remember the jeans she had on.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.323
Definitely the jeans.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.595
(Laura laughs)

15:42.628 --> 15:44.966
- He was tall, and he had

15:44.999 --> 15:48.640
these flared boot cut
jeans on, black boots.

15:48.673 --> 15:50.176
Mind you, it's summer.

15:51.746 --> 15:54.552
- [Carl] She was just like the
quintessential Aussie chick.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.321
Often barefoot in church.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.758
- I'm pretty sure
I had no shoes on.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.029
- Took me a while to
get her to date me,

16:00.062 --> 16:01.599
but I worked through all that.

16:01.633 --> 16:03.637
(gentle piano music)

16:03.670 --> 16:08.078
Her reservations were probably
my fake diamond chain I wore.

16:08.112 --> 16:10.116
Probably my too cool attitude.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.053
- [Laura] He had two
big hoop earrings in,

16:12.086 --> 16:13.389
and his hair was like NSYNC.

16:13.422 --> 16:17.731
- [Carl] My NSYNC hair,
my general Americanness.

16:17.765 --> 16:20.436
- And I just remembered, I was
like, "Ah, he's so American."

16:22.173 --> 16:25.346
Week two, I think we told each
other we loved each other.

16:25.379 --> 16:27.150
(laughs)
It went fast.

16:27.183 --> 16:31.793
(gentle music)
(projector clicks)

16:31.826 --> 16:36.368
Our wedding was May 5th, 2003.

16:36.401 --> 16:39.140
Pastor Brian did our ceremony.

16:41.579 --> 16:43.115
We were 23 at the time.

16:44.451 --> 16:46.388
- [Carl] You kind of
think at that stage,

16:46.421 --> 16:47.691
getting married's
gonna fix a lot

16:47.725 --> 16:49.194
of the issues in your heart.

16:51.098 --> 16:52.601
Like your desire to have sex.

16:52.635 --> 16:55.206
(tense music)

16:56.441 --> 16:59.080
Your desire for other people.

16:59.114 --> 17:02.621
- [Brian] Generation to know
that I knew Laura at that size,

17:02.655 --> 17:06.361
and I can remember holding
Laura at that size,

17:06.395 --> 17:07.363
screaming her lungs out.

17:07.397 --> 17:09.735
(congregation laughs)

17:09.769 --> 17:13.442
(words fade to dramatic music)

17:13.475 --> 17:15.479
- Maybe everything in
your fleshly desire

17:15.514 --> 17:18.219
consumes you today,
keep turning the page.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.624
There will be a moment
where your appetite changes,

17:20.657 --> 17:23.429
your vision changes, where
you love what God loves.

17:25.199 --> 17:28.305
In Christianity, marriage
is only second to salvation.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.376
So you're basically
incomplete until that happens.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.615
You know, it was like
I gotta find this,

17:32.648 --> 17:34.719
this missing piece that's
gonna make me whole.

17:34.752 --> 17:36.488
There's no way that a
loving God could want you

17:36.522 --> 17:38.760
to stay with the same
person for your whole life.

17:38.793 --> 17:40.162
I mean it's ridiculous, right?

17:40.196 --> 17:41.699
Marriage, yeah, it doesn't work?

17:41.733 --> 17:43.369
Wrong.

17:43.402 --> 17:44.672
You don't see like
true single people

17:44.705 --> 17:46.375
in high levels of leadership.

17:46.408 --> 17:48.847
Like somebody who's big time
preacher, and they're single.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.118
So just you knew
that getting married

17:51.151 --> 17:52.788
was like the next
thing you gotta do,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.391
so everybody had that aim.

17:54.424 --> 17:57.631
We spend so much time telling
people to get married,

17:57.665 --> 18:00.269
how to stay pure
until you're married.

18:00.303 --> 18:02.641
Surely I'm not gonna have
these thoughts if I'm married.

18:02.675 --> 18:04.545
Surely I'm not gonna have these
thoughts when I get older.

18:04.578 --> 18:07.383
Surely if I know Jesus
better, some of these thoughts

18:07.417 --> 18:09.588
and some of these feelings
are gonna go away.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.431
You gotta handle it head on,
or else it'll destroy you.

18:19.709 --> 18:24.585
(distant siren wailing)
(tense music)

18:26.589 --> 18:30.429
- In 2013, during the
period of my reporting,

18:30.463 --> 18:32.901
Carl Lentz was a very
believable person.

18:32.935 --> 18:34.839
- That you once lived one way,

18:34.872 --> 18:37.443
and now I want you
to live this way.

18:37.477 --> 18:39.247
- I couldn't find
anything that was going on

18:39.280 --> 18:40.684
in New York that was,

18:43.757 --> 18:46.763
sketchy, or gave me pause.

18:46.796 --> 18:49.167
It was a very...

18:49.200 --> 18:51.906
For me, it was an alarmingly
positive environment.

18:51.939 --> 18:53.743
- Anybody need that
revelation today?

18:53.777 --> 18:55.313
Maybe you came in
carrying too much?

18:55.346 --> 18:56.582
Let me pray for you.

18:56.616 --> 18:57.685
Father, we give you
praise right now.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.458
- Well I mean, I don't know
where abuse of power comes in,

19:01.492 --> 19:03.496
I don't know where
infidelity comes in,

19:03.530 --> 19:06.636
I don't know at what
point that started.

19:06.669 --> 19:08.339
- Men are a lot worse than women

19:08.372 --> 19:10.544
when it comes to being honest
with what you struggle with,

19:10.577 --> 19:11.612
'cause he's heard, "Man up."

19:11.646 --> 19:12.881
What does that even mean?

19:12.915 --> 19:15.252
We're a part of the new
generation, man down.

19:15.286 --> 19:18.459
- Performance can
take over your life.

19:18.493 --> 19:21.733
- I would rather be a man on
my knees looking vulnerable,

19:21.766 --> 19:24.371
than being a man on
my feet living shaky,

19:24.404 --> 19:26.776
because I don't want
God to actually help me

19:26.809 --> 19:28.880
because somebody might know
I don't have it all together.

19:28.913 --> 19:33.590
- You are the performer that
you have to be every Sunday,

19:34.859 --> 19:36.763
rather than the man you
need to be every day.

19:36.796 --> 19:39.935
- I define scandal as when
you see something happening

19:39.969 --> 19:41.806
that should not be happening.

19:41.839 --> 19:44.277
- I remember watching
him and thinking,

19:44.310 --> 19:47.250
"There's no way
what this requires

19:47.283 --> 19:51.926
"can exist in the form of a
man without that man breaking."

19:54.264 --> 19:56.636
(tense music)

20:00.877 --> 20:05.386
- Imagine planning a party for
20 people, and 350 show up.

20:07.423 --> 20:11.866
The tension of Brian's
pace of expansion,

20:11.899 --> 20:15.473
versus the reality of
what we were dealing with.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.947
- Every time you get the
chance to stand on a platform

20:18.980 --> 20:21.552
like this with a microphone,
it's a chance to stretch,

20:21.586 --> 20:23.957
to enlarge, and to build people.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.729
That's why I love
building a church.

20:26.763 --> 20:29.802
- Hey, like, we can barely
handle what we have right now.

20:29.835 --> 20:31.739
Like, we don't have
enough leaders,

20:31.773 --> 20:33.543
our structure's
not strong enough.

20:33.576 --> 20:35.947
(tense music)

20:35.981 --> 20:40.322
- You choose to be miserable,
you choose to be pitiful.

20:40.356 --> 20:41.626
You can throw a pity party,

20:41.659 --> 20:44.565
and you can invite
anyone you want,

20:44.598 --> 20:47.403
but the only person who's
gonna turn up is the devil.

20:48.338 --> 20:49.474
- You're trying to plan it,

20:49.508 --> 20:50.877
you're trying to make sure
you're doing the right thing,

20:50.911 --> 20:52.981
you're trying to, you
know, and all the while,

20:53.015 --> 20:54.518
you're trying to make
sure you're making

20:54.552 --> 20:56.354
the mothership happy as well.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.829
- Carl obviously, you know,
he's magnetic, attractive guy.

20:59.862 --> 21:02.568
I mean his tattoos are a
problem, but big picture he's-

21:02.601 --> 21:04.972
- You don't like, you
don't like the tattoos?

21:05.005 --> 21:06.976
- They're okay, they're okay.

21:07.009 --> 21:11.384
- If you have issues in your
life, influence, and power,

21:11.418 --> 21:14.357
and position will
exacerbate all of them.

21:14.390 --> 21:17.731
And then we hit New York City,
and the level of pressure,

21:17.764 --> 21:20.804
and the level of visibility,
and the level of responsibility

21:20.837 --> 21:22.608
was so huge, so quick.

21:22.641 --> 21:25.780
(tense music)

21:25.814 --> 21:27.684
I talked to Brian,
floated the idea

21:27.718 --> 21:30.389
that I don't know
if I'm feeling good.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.895
Like I feel like my head
is kind of spinning,

21:32.928 --> 21:35.634
and I'm tired, and I don't
know how long I can do this,

21:35.667 --> 21:37.436
services like this.

21:38.773 --> 21:40.476
I think I did seven
today, and he goes,

21:40.510 --> 21:42.614
"When I was your
age, I was doing 11."

21:42.648 --> 21:45.887
- And weakness
makes us dig deeper.

21:45.921 --> 21:47.356
The apostle Paul says,

21:47.390 --> 21:49.628
"When I am weak
then I am strong."

21:49.662 --> 21:51.499
- Maybe I internalized
that and just was like,

21:51.532 --> 21:53.903
"If that guy's doing 11 then,

21:53.937 --> 21:56.474
"and doing fricking
basically 10 now,

21:57.276 --> 21:59.815
"I better, I better
up my ante here."

21:59.849 --> 22:02.453
Before you know it, you're
so far in over your head,

22:02.486 --> 22:04.390
that it's a matter of time.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.029
Can we all just give God
three, four seconds of praise?

22:07.063 --> 22:08.800
You can shout, you can
clap, you can move.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.035
(crowd applauds and cheers)

22:10.069 --> 22:12.440
Fill me up again, he
will do it here and now.

22:12.473 --> 22:14.645
(crowd cheers)

22:14.678 --> 22:15.479
Can I get an amen?

22:16.816 --> 22:18.118
Are you grateful that
he saved your life?

22:18.151 --> 22:20.422
(Carl chattering rapidly)

22:20.456 --> 22:25.399
Take a moment and give God
thanks for what he's done.

22:25.432 --> 22:29.942
One of my addictive
patterns was something

22:29.975 --> 22:33.448
that started just as a regular,
you know, prescription drug.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.019
You need to feel the touch
of God, you don't have to...

22:35.052 --> 22:38.793
I was diagnosed with
ADHD super early.

22:38.826 --> 22:42.534
Once I left college, I
was given a prescription,

22:42.568 --> 22:46.074
and I stayed on that
prescription for
the rest of my life.

22:47.009 --> 22:49.548
I started just to take more.

22:49.582 --> 22:50.884
I didn't tell my doctor
I was doing that,

22:50.917 --> 22:52.019
I didn't tell anybody.

22:52.053 --> 22:53.723
If you're sitting on your
hands, I'm preaching to you!

22:53.756 --> 22:56.729
It enables you to
continue to do your job,

22:58.131 --> 23:00.737
and you're just going, and
you're going, and you're going.

23:00.770 --> 23:04.511
I was, you know, doing my
best to wall myself off,

23:04.545 --> 23:05.981
because you don't want
to see what's in here.

23:06.014 --> 23:07.116
(crowd cheers)

23:07.149 --> 23:08.519
How y'all doin' up there?

23:08.553 --> 23:09.655
- [Journalist] Any
sort of drugs mixed

23:09.688 --> 23:11.458
with any sort of
sexual addictions,

23:11.492 --> 23:12.995
mixed with any sort of pressure,

23:13.028 --> 23:15.567
is gonna create a
storm of problems.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.775
(chaotic people chattering)

23:19.808 --> 23:22.581
- In October, 2020,
a Hillsong staffer

23:22.614 --> 23:24.919
informed Hillsong leadership
that they had found

23:24.952 --> 23:27.591
some sort of incriminating
text messages of Carl's.

23:28.893 --> 23:31.999
The messages were to a
woman named Ranin Karim,

23:32.033 --> 23:34.437
and Hillsong leadership
approached Carl about it.

23:40.784 --> 23:43.923
- I just remember
feeling like I,

23:43.957 --> 23:47.463
am I in a alternate
universe right now?

23:48.766 --> 23:50.870
The hardest part of
this was just try not

23:50.904 --> 23:52.741
to look my wife
in the eye, ever.

23:56.682 --> 23:59.120
(Carl sniffs)

24:04.698 --> 24:07.069
(tense music)

24:11.879 --> 24:14.551
- It was October 25th,
I remember that day.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.158
(tense music)

24:19.862 --> 24:22.466
Carl's like, "Hey, can I
talk to you for a second?"

24:24.605 --> 24:27.176
As soon as he shut the
door and I saw his face,

24:27.209 --> 24:29.047
my heart just...

24:29.080 --> 24:31.652
(tense music)

24:35.560 --> 24:37.564
My heart just dropped,
and I was like,

24:38.966 --> 24:43.876
I could tell it was,
it was something big.

24:43.910 --> 24:47.784
I didn't know what he
was gonna say, but,

24:50.657 --> 24:55.500
when he did, my whole
world changed, it crashed.

24:56.034 --> 24:58.506
(tense music)

25:01.645 --> 25:03.248
- It was about one
o'clock in the morning,

25:03.281 --> 25:05.653
and the phone went,
and it was Laura.

25:07.023 --> 25:08.826
- That was hard.

25:08.860 --> 25:10.129
Yeah, it was really hard.

25:10.162 --> 25:12.834
She was very distressed.

25:12.868 --> 25:16.074
- He basically said, "I have
been unfaithful to you."

25:17.611 --> 25:19.715
I was like, "What,
what does that mean?"

25:19.748 --> 25:23.255
Like, "Who is it and
do you love her?"

25:23.288 --> 25:25.159
Like what is, what?

25:25.192 --> 25:27.698
Like it was just unbelievable.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.704
- Being on the other
side of the world,

25:30.737 --> 25:32.239
and not being able to hug her,

25:32.273 --> 25:33.976
(chuckles)

25:34.010 --> 25:37.249
that was just, oh,
devastating as it grieved us.

25:39.020 --> 25:39.888
Yeah.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.863
(tense music)

25:47.637 --> 25:49.775
- I thought about my kids.

25:49.808 --> 25:50.977
That was my first thought.

25:53.115 --> 25:54.350
Then it was so stupid,

25:54.383 --> 25:58.024
but I thought about our
church and our staff.

25:58.058 --> 26:00.630
(light music)

26:04.772 --> 26:06.742
- I, I just, I...

26:08.311 --> 26:10.282
There are some things
that you can recover from.

26:10.315 --> 26:11.585
There's other things

26:15.058 --> 26:17.163
that I'll never recover from.

26:17.196 --> 26:21.237
Just the sound of her voice,
the kind of cry that she had

26:21.271 --> 26:23.041
was like no other
cry I've ever heard.

26:27.951 --> 26:30.088
You know, nobody
should go through that,

26:30.122 --> 26:34.030
especially a wife that
is flawless in character.

26:34.063 --> 26:36.735
(light music)

26:38.940 --> 26:41.344
And I told her the best
I could at that time,

26:41.377 --> 26:43.348
and at that time I
wasn't even fully honest,

26:43.381 --> 26:45.653
'cause I didn't even know
how deep it ran in me.

26:47.223 --> 26:49.393
- Carl is a person
that doesn't know

26:49.427 --> 26:51.064
how to get a no for an answer.

26:51.097 --> 26:52.934
- [Reporter] Do you
believe that you were

26:52.968 --> 26:55.673
the first person he ever did
something like this with?

26:55.707 --> 26:57.711
- I honestly don't
know at this point.

27:05.960 --> 27:06.762
- I told Laura.

27:08.699 --> 27:11.872
She wasn't mad, she was
just so broken and...

27:17.717 --> 27:21.090
I don't know, people who have
walked through infidelity

27:21.124 --> 27:22.894
know what I'm talking
about right now,

27:22.928 --> 27:25.900
and it's a dark place to be,

27:27.069 --> 27:29.173
but that's how it went down.

27:29.207 --> 27:32.346
And then we went
home, I called Brian.

27:34.718 --> 27:35.653
I told him.

27:40.262 --> 27:42.099
I remember telling
him I'm in trouble.

27:42.132 --> 27:45.305
You know, I'm not doing,
I'm not doing well.

27:45.339 --> 27:46.942
I'm not doing well.

27:46.976 --> 27:49.681
My mind was so scattered,
and it was ugly.

27:51.084 --> 27:52.253
I remember him
saying, "Okay, okay."

27:52.286 --> 27:55.125
It was short, it wasn't harsh,
or not harsh, or anything.

27:55.158 --> 27:56.962
It was more like I
think I could see

27:56.996 --> 27:58.365
the wheels already
turning for him.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.978
Hillsong leadership told
me we have a Zoom meeting.

28:07.249 --> 28:09.020
It was with some of the
board, it was with Brian,

28:09.053 --> 28:10.389
and they said we're gonna
meet with you and Laura

28:10.422 --> 28:12.727
and talk even more in depth.

28:12.761 --> 28:14.397
At this time, I still think,

28:14.430 --> 28:16.134
"This is my church,
this is my family,"

28:16.167 --> 28:19.006
so I'm like, "What questions
do you need me to answer

28:19.040 --> 28:21.110
"so you can handle
this correctly?"

28:23.114 --> 28:26.989
- On the Zoom call, they
asked Carl about Leona.

28:30.897 --> 28:32.132
At this point I didn't know,

28:32.166 --> 28:34.003
he hadn't told me this part yet.

28:35.807 --> 28:39.781
Leona came into our life
to help me with the kids,

28:39.815 --> 28:41.986
and be our nanny,
and be on staff.

28:43.789 --> 28:47.764
Leona was paid, but she was
really a part of our family.

28:47.797 --> 28:49.935
I knew my kids
were in good hands.

28:51.872 --> 28:53.174
(siren wailing)

28:53.208 --> 28:55.880
- When I graduated
from Hillsong College,

28:55.914 --> 28:59.788
I made a decision to go
help launch Hillsong Boston.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.525
(audience applauding)

29:01.558 --> 29:05.265
Hillsong Boston was being
run by Josh and Leona Kimes,

29:05.299 --> 29:08.071
who have always been a
part of Hillsong Church.

29:08.104 --> 29:10.475
- Let's live loud as a servant,

29:10.510 --> 29:13.916
just like Jesus, Matthew 20:28,

29:13.950 --> 29:16.789
who didn't come to be
served but to serve.

29:16.822 --> 29:20.028
- I ended up moving
to be their nanny.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.799
(train rumbling)

29:21.832 --> 29:26.508
I was Leona's nanny while
Leona was Carl's nanny.

29:27.978 --> 29:30.550
This is a picture
that Lila drew.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.188
It's supposed to be her and
that's supposed to be me.

29:33.221 --> 29:36.094
So while I was
watching her child,

29:36.127 --> 29:38.833
she was watching
over their children.

29:38.866 --> 29:41.805
(children chattering)

29:41.839 --> 29:43.909
- She was always there.

29:43.943 --> 29:45.178
(children chattering)

29:45.212 --> 29:48.051
Leona would be at my
house Christmas day,

29:48.084 --> 29:50.255
Christmas morning opening
presents with my kids,

29:50.288 --> 29:52.126
and I'm like, "Hey,
you can go home.

29:52.159 --> 29:53.395
"You don't need to be here."

29:54.965 --> 29:56.301
"Oh no, no, it's fine,

29:56.334 --> 29:58.004
"and I've got a
babysitter so it's fine."

29:59.407 --> 30:03.949
- I was doing up to 40,
sometimes even 60 hours

30:03.983 --> 30:06.020
during the week for
Hillsong Boston.

30:06.622 --> 30:08.859
I wanted to be a pastor,

30:08.893 --> 30:11.598
but the closest
thing I can get to it

30:11.632 --> 30:13.234
was being a pastor's nanny.

30:15.540 --> 30:18.278
(children chattering)

30:18.311 --> 30:21.284
- You've got someone in
your house all the time,

30:21.317 --> 30:23.388
and I would sometimes get
these little feelings.

30:25.125 --> 30:28.833
And then one night I found them
in a compromising position.

30:30.302 --> 30:33.274
I know I'm seeing something
that is not right.

30:33.308 --> 30:37.216
I ran into the room, and
I shoved Carl and hit him,

30:37.249 --> 30:40.489
and then I jumped on top
of her, and I punched her.

30:40.523 --> 30:42.527
I may have broken
my pinky finger.

30:44.196 --> 30:46.902
Something came over
me, and I was angry,

30:46.935 --> 30:50.275
and I definitely freaked out.

30:50.308 --> 30:53.014
(static buzzing)

30:54.283 --> 30:57.924
She was like, "I'm gonna
leave because I can't be

30:57.957 --> 30:59.628
"around someone who
thinks I did something

30:59.661 --> 31:01.064
"that I did not do."

31:02.266 --> 31:03.401
And then that kind of died down,

31:03.435 --> 31:06.174
you know, never
talked about it again.

31:06.207 --> 31:09.080
She was still in my house
and still was around.

31:10.917 --> 31:13.188
And I'm sure people are
like, "You're insane,"

31:13.221 --> 31:16.427
but it just, I
don't know how to...

31:20.603 --> 31:23.341
We were her pastors,
we were her leaders,

31:23.374 --> 31:27.049
she was on staff, like
it got really messy.

31:28.318 --> 31:29.621
Instead of talking about it,

31:29.654 --> 31:31.491
again I would just
stuff it down,

31:31.525 --> 31:34.430
and like things, I would
definitely be very,

31:34.463 --> 31:36.167
probably too harsh with her.

31:37.570 --> 31:39.039
How's it going, Leona?

31:40.175 --> 31:41.210
- [Leona] What?

31:41.244 --> 31:42.045
Why?

31:43.114 --> 31:44.450
- You offered to do it.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.059
I was in a really
tormented place mentally.

31:50.395 --> 31:53.067
I don't know what's happening
in my house anymore.

31:55.205 --> 32:00.081
I was pretty much gaslit by
both of them for quite a while.

32:01.384 --> 32:02.520
- You have to really
search out his stories,

32:02.554 --> 32:04.624
'cause often they're just,

32:04.658 --> 32:07.229
there's just some
inconsistencies.

32:07.262 --> 32:10.168
(traffic humming)

32:16.414 --> 32:19.186
- On the Zoom call, the
truth came out there

32:19.220 --> 32:21.057
in front of everyone.

32:21.692 --> 32:23.496
Another affair.

32:23.529 --> 32:27.102
So my feelings
about that situation

32:27.136 --> 32:29.975
for a long time
were actually true.

32:30.008 --> 32:32.614
And I had to move
off of the screen,

32:32.647 --> 32:34.518
because I was devastated.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.995
Like out of everything
that I've had to deal with,

32:40.028 --> 32:44.538
I've had to process that
situation probably the most.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.476
(tense music)

32:47.510 --> 32:50.282
- I was way too vulnerable in
that meeting, and I regret it.

32:50.315 --> 32:51.184
I just...

32:52.252 --> 32:53.421
I never thought that anything

32:53.454 --> 32:57.296
from that meeting
would be twisted, ever,

32:57.329 --> 33:01.470
and so I told 'em everything
I could about every situation.

33:02.740 --> 33:06.515
Exactly what had been
going on in my life,

33:06.548 --> 33:08.384
and they thanked me for that,

33:08.418 --> 33:11.457
and that was the last
time I saw 99% of 'em,

33:11.490 --> 33:13.562
when that Zoom call was over.

33:13.596 --> 33:16.133
(tense music)

33:18.539 --> 33:20.776
- A month before this,

33:20.810 --> 33:24.183
and I got a call that my
daughter had to go to the ER,

33:24.216 --> 33:29.093
'cause she had tried to
take a bunch of pills.

33:30.061 --> 33:32.199
(tense music)

33:32.232 --> 33:35.005
When I found out
about the betrayal,

33:36.307 --> 33:39.113
I sent texts and
emails to Bobbie.

33:39.781 --> 33:42.452
My biggest plea was,

33:42.486 --> 33:47.129
if you could just spare the
details as much as possible,

33:48.364 --> 33:51.605
because my daughter is
in a very fragile state.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.041
(message dings softly)

33:53.074 --> 33:56.214
(tense music)

33:56.247 --> 33:59.186
(message dings softly)

34:02.125 --> 34:05.198
(message dings softly)

34:06.735 --> 34:10.041
(message dings softly)

34:13.147 --> 34:15.185
(message dings)

34:15.218 --> 34:17.122
The message back was
that they would try,

34:17.155 --> 34:21.531
and at this point I still
felt like they were family and

34:25.539 --> 34:27.476
that we would be taken
care of and I was safe.

34:29.413 --> 34:33.087
And I learned pretty
quick that that changed.

34:37.830 --> 34:40.201
(tense music)

34:40.235 --> 34:42.540
- [Reporter] In this recording
obtained by the Daily Mail,

34:42.573 --> 34:45.378
Brian Houston allegedly
revealing a timeline

34:45.412 --> 34:47.249
of improper behavior by Lentz.

34:56.835 --> 34:59.373
- I had no idea ever, ever,

34:59.406 --> 35:01.243
that somebody would use
confidential information

35:01.277 --> 35:03.616
like that in that way.

35:03.649 --> 35:05.753
- Speaking to our
staff about things

35:05.786 --> 35:09.226
that Carl had said privately
and I had said privately.

35:09.259 --> 35:12.533
- And it was leaked literally
directly to the Daily Mail.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.291
- We were fired.

35:26.928 --> 35:28.599
Oh, resigned, sorry.

35:29.734 --> 35:31.571
It just felt like I was fired,

35:31.605 --> 35:34.410
because it wasn't
really an option.

35:35.713 --> 35:37.583
- There was a, you know,
a story or a narrative

35:37.617 --> 35:39.554
that she, you
know, had resigned,

35:39.587 --> 35:41.490
which is true but she
was told to resign.

35:51.243 --> 35:53.615
- There's children involved,

35:53.649 --> 35:58.324
and to say such nasty things,
it was really damaging.

36:01.765 --> 36:06.675
- My head began to kinda
lose the few screws

36:07.510 --> 36:08.444
it had left in it.

36:09.714 --> 36:13.221
I thought about just
ways to get out of this,

36:13.254 --> 36:14.724
to cause the least
amount of damage,

36:14.758 --> 36:16.561
knowing that there
was no way out,

36:16.595 --> 36:20.335
and definitely thought
about vacating the planet.

36:22.406 --> 36:25.713
- What's my life now?

36:25.746 --> 36:28.886
What am, like what
else can I do?

36:28.919 --> 36:30.321
I'd lost everything.

36:34.229 --> 36:36.668
(somber music)

36:38.304 --> 36:41.712
- October of 2018, I got really,

36:41.745 --> 36:44.283
really sick while at service,

36:45.720 --> 36:49.460
and I didn't have
insurance in Massachusetts.

36:50.996 --> 36:54.002
My friends at church took
me to the bus station,

36:54.036 --> 36:56.307
so I can take a bus
from Boston to New York,

36:56.340 --> 36:58.679
just so I can go to the
hospital and get checked.

37:00.683 --> 37:03.822
I was still in this
mindset, I need to serve,

37:03.856 --> 37:07.964
that I was sick in
bed in New York,

37:07.997 --> 37:10.870
and still doing administrative
work for Hillsong Boston.

37:13.408 --> 37:15.880
And then the day
after Thanksgiving,

37:15.913 --> 37:17.617
I got a text message from Josh.

37:18.852 --> 37:21.658
That text was basically
him letting me go

37:21.691 --> 37:24.263
from my volunteer positions,

37:24.296 --> 37:28.772
as if everything I
did meant nothing,

37:28.806 --> 37:31.812
and I fell into a
very bad depression.

37:34.684 --> 37:37.657
I felt so alone, and I
had no one to turn to.

37:38.559 --> 37:41.531
(soft tense music)

37:48.712 --> 37:51.952
- You know, church can
be a phenomenal blessing

37:51.985 --> 37:55.458
in people's lives, or it can
be a sledgehammer of pain.

37:57.028 --> 38:00.401
For a long time I defended
everybody, I defended Brian,

38:00.435 --> 38:02.940
and it took me a while to
get out of that head space,

38:02.974 --> 38:05.378
and realize probably
some unhealthy mindsets

38:05.411 --> 38:06.715
that I was intertwined with.

38:08.484 --> 38:11.390
I'm tired of this damage,
I'm tired of this wreckage,

38:11.423 --> 38:15.298
I'm tired of putting
people I love through pain.

38:15.331 --> 38:17.002
The decisions that I made,

38:17.035 --> 38:20.041
the pain those caused,
the betrayals involved,

38:20.074 --> 38:22.814
I did those things,
those are on me,

38:22.847 --> 38:25.451
I take responsibility for those,

38:25.485 --> 38:28.659
and the rest of my life I'll
be making amends where I can,

38:28.692 --> 38:30.930
and it's also my
job to go figure out

38:30.963 --> 38:32.399
how the hell that happened.

38:33.502 --> 38:36.440
(basketball thumping)

38:36.473 --> 38:38.679
You know, when I really
started unwinding

38:38.712 --> 38:40.381
what happened to me as a child,

38:40.415 --> 38:42.553
you know, it was really,
it was really rough.

38:45.124 --> 38:47.362
I'm able to talk about
it now, you know, barely.

38:48.866 --> 38:50.068
Well I pushed it
down for a long time,

38:50.101 --> 38:51.771
because I didn't
wanna hurt my parents,

38:51.805 --> 38:53.374
and my parents are amazing.

38:53.407 --> 38:56.013
(thunder cracks)

38:59.019 --> 39:01.090
And, you know, it
was a family friend

39:01.123 --> 39:02.493
had sexually abused me.

39:04.531 --> 39:06.902
My brain had kind of shut
off some of that memory,

39:09.406 --> 39:11.443
just stuff you don't
really like to think about,

39:11.477 --> 39:12.813
I don't care how old you are,

39:12.847 --> 39:14.584
you don't want to
go through that.

39:14.617 --> 39:17.924
(tense music)

39:17.957 --> 39:19.694
And I was told
when I was abused,

39:19.727 --> 39:21.798
"Let's not tell
anybody about this.

39:21.831 --> 39:23.702
"This is gonna be our secret.

39:23.735 --> 39:25.405
"You know, protect
that," you know,

39:25.438 --> 39:27.610
and when you're a kid, you
don't really process it,

39:27.643 --> 39:29.647
and you don't realize what
your brain is processing,

39:29.681 --> 39:33.522
and I would learn to
hide stuff for no reason,

39:33.555 --> 39:34.891
from my parents, from people.

39:36.661 --> 39:39.867
I developed a
pattern of secrecy.

39:41.003 --> 39:43.842
(thunder cracks)

39:49.453 --> 39:50.789
I had such deep shame.

39:53.695 --> 39:56.735
My eyes saw things at a young
age I shouldn't have seen.

40:01.578 --> 40:05.084
(basketball thumps)

40:05.118 --> 40:07.556
Gotta get a drink here,
probably take a breath.

40:13.568 --> 40:16.473
I've never really got into
any detail about that.

40:16.508 --> 40:18.979
(soft music)

40:30.234 --> 40:32.607
- After Hillsong news
and Carl Lentz news

40:32.640 --> 40:34.176
had gone quiet for a few months,

40:34.209 --> 40:36.648
Leona Kimes published
an essay on Medium,

40:36.681 --> 40:39.954
where she said that Carl had
been sexually abusing her.

40:39.988 --> 40:42.560
(soft music)

40:48.672 --> 40:50.876
(soft music)

40:58.625 --> 41:00.996
(soft music)

41:12.085 --> 41:15.959
- I am responsible for allowing

41:15.993 --> 41:20.101
an inappropriate relationship
to develop in my house

41:20.134 --> 41:23.140
with someone that worked for us.

41:23.174 --> 41:28.050
Any notion of abuse is
categorically false.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.991
There were mutual adult
decisions made by two people

41:32.025 --> 41:36.000
who lied profusely,
mainly to my wife.

41:37.168 --> 41:39.674
(soft music)

41:47.923 --> 41:50.896
It's an issue,
because I was a boss,

41:50.929 --> 41:52.666
this person was an employee.

41:52.700 --> 41:54.737
I'm responsible for
that power dynamic,

41:54.771 --> 41:56.875
and the management of it, and
the wisdom that goes with it,

41:56.908 --> 41:59.781
and I failed
absolutely miserably.

41:59.814 --> 42:02.118
(soft music)

42:08.765 --> 42:09.901
This is a shepherd's staff.

42:11.103 --> 42:12.773
A real good shepherd would see

42:12.807 --> 42:14.644
that little lambie walking away,

42:14.677 --> 42:18.919
and it would crack its leg,
sometimes even breaking the leg.

42:18.952 --> 42:20.622
You know when you when you
see those beautiful pictures

42:20.656 --> 42:22.058
of Jesus walking in the
hillside with that lambie,

42:22.092 --> 42:23.695
he just broke that thing's leg.

42:25.031 --> 42:26.634
- Spiritual abuse
is where somebody

42:26.668 --> 42:30.609
who's got authority in
your life as a pastor,

42:30.642 --> 42:33.180
as a spiritual
leader of some kind,

42:33.214 --> 42:36.320
is taking advantage of you.

42:36.353 --> 42:40.562
- But a good shepherd would
then take that little lambie

42:40.596 --> 42:41.898
that has a little broken leg,

42:41.931 --> 42:44.069
and it would stay
right by the shepherd.

42:44.102 --> 42:45.304
And as it would grow up,

42:45.338 --> 42:46.941
the shepherd would
never leave it,

42:46.975 --> 42:49.714
and that lamb when it was
tempted to wander the next time,

42:49.747 --> 42:52.218
it would remember that
moment when it got corrected,

42:52.252 --> 42:54.256
and next thing you know,
all that lamb has ever known

42:54.289 --> 42:56.861
is living right next
to the shepherd.

42:56.895 --> 42:58.632
I'm not saying...
- But there's no cost

42:58.665 --> 43:00.869
that justifies
the kind of damage

43:00.903 --> 43:02.205
to the soul that happens

43:02.238 --> 43:04.009
in a spiritually
abusive relationship.

43:05.946 --> 43:09.687
Someone who's acting in
a spiritually abusive way

43:09.720 --> 43:11.991
to their members, to their
staff, to their family,

43:12.025 --> 43:15.031
to whomever it is, they've
disqualified themselves.

43:19.106 --> 43:20.308
- In my heart of hearts,

43:20.341 --> 43:22.312
of course I need to
call someone and say,

43:22.345 --> 43:25.351
"I have disqualified
myself from ministry,

43:25.384 --> 43:28.625
"and y'all need to,
you need to take over."

43:28.658 --> 43:30.161
That's what should
have happened.

43:30.194 --> 43:31.831
I should have done that.

43:31.865 --> 43:33.635
I didn't, I wasn't healthy.

43:33.668 --> 43:36.039
(tense music)

43:42.018 --> 43:45.258
(tense music)

43:45.291 --> 43:47.797
- Part of the
devastation that happens

43:47.830 --> 43:49.967
when these churches fall apart
is people sort of wake up

43:50.001 --> 43:51.938
to their own complicity,

43:51.971 --> 43:54.777
and they see that they
were part of something

43:54.811 --> 43:56.981
that was so toxic
and so damaging.

43:57.015 --> 43:58.785
They're not only
trying to sort of

43:58.819 --> 44:00.321
reconcile it with themselves,

44:00.354 --> 44:03.060
they're trying to reconcile
it with their faith.

44:03.093 --> 44:05.666
(tense music)

44:12.412 --> 44:16.921
(somber instrumental music)

44:16.955 --> 44:19.894
- Whether it's, you
know, LGBTQ issues,

44:19.927 --> 44:24.402
or Black Lives Matter,
Christianity is
always a step behind.

44:26.306 --> 44:29.212
So it's not like Carl Lentz was

44:31.350 --> 44:33.120
in front of anything, right,

44:33.153 --> 44:34.690
as far as the secular world.

44:37.496 --> 44:42.105
You take him out of church,
he's not progressive,

44:43.808 --> 44:47.148
but in the church world,
he seems ahead of his time.

44:48.317 --> 44:50.187
- It's okay if you're in America

44:50.221 --> 44:52.893
to say "Black lives
matter," end of sentence.

44:52.927 --> 44:54.864
It doesn't mean that
other lives don't,

44:54.897 --> 44:57.035
it just means these do, we're
gonna say that sentence.

44:57.068 --> 44:59.372
- Okay, that's good, all right.

45:09.794 --> 45:13.334
- We had a very diverse crew,

45:13.367 --> 45:15.471
you know, very diverse church.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.041
I personally have a
lot of relationships

45:17.075 --> 45:18.945
with non-white people,

45:18.979 --> 45:21.918
and I felt like overall our
church was pretty quiet.

45:21.951 --> 45:25.091
(somber music)

45:25.124 --> 45:26.961
It was less about politics,

45:26.995 --> 45:31.203
it was less about, you know,
this giant conversation.

45:31.236 --> 45:33.240
More about if you're
hurting, we're hurting.

45:33.274 --> 45:35.177
You know, if you're
going through it,

45:35.211 --> 45:36.480
we're gonna go
through it together.

45:38.350 --> 45:40.454
To me it wasn't like
this valiant call,

45:40.488 --> 45:42.458
and people tried to
make it like that,

45:42.492 --> 45:44.362
because after we looked
around, I was like,

45:44.396 --> 45:46.801
but there are a lot of people
who are silent on this,

45:46.834 --> 45:48.872
and that's their
right, no judgment,

45:48.905 --> 45:50.976
but I'm not, I'm not
gonna be silent on it.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.815
(somber music)

45:53.848 --> 45:57.021
- When all these, you know,

45:57.055 --> 46:01.831
murders are happening, and
Black people are being killed,

46:02.833 --> 46:07.208
and nobody is saying anything,

46:08.878 --> 46:10.816
he gets all this acclaim,

46:10.849 --> 46:13.955
just because Christianity
is so, so backwards.

46:13.989 --> 46:15.491
- Black lives matter.

46:15.525 --> 46:18.230
(crowd cheers)

46:35.999 --> 46:38.838
- Here's why I'll say
no, I don't think it was.

46:38.872 --> 46:42.245
We struggled with diversity
as a leadership team.

46:42.278 --> 46:44.550
And, you know, I brought
that up many times,

46:44.583 --> 46:48.525
and I don't think
it was intentional.

46:48.558 --> 46:51.330
I'm not saying that we're
a deeply racist church,

46:51.363 --> 46:54.035
I'm just saying we do
not have a single pastor

46:54.069 --> 46:58.912
on a global level that
is not a white man.

47:00.214 --> 47:01.851
And so that's where
the system failed.

47:03.354 --> 47:08.230
- Megachurches are sending,
you know, 26-year-old white men

47:09.900 --> 47:13.975
to places like Brooklyn to
pastor to minority populations.

47:15.344 --> 47:18.585
Cultural situations that
they don't understand,

47:18.618 --> 47:22.358
or they're not equipped
or trained to exist in.

47:22.392 --> 47:24.563
- You ever been to jail?

47:24.597 --> 47:26.901
Don't raise your hand if
you've been, don't do it.

47:26.934 --> 47:29.039
You gonna stay mad single.

47:29.072 --> 47:32.445
- That becomes
really problematic,

47:32.478 --> 47:35.251
and we had, you know,
a number of occasions

47:35.284 --> 47:37.589
where sources would say to us,

47:37.623 --> 47:41.329
"What Hillsong did
was colonize the city,

47:41.363 --> 47:43.400
"and I don't know if I
want them here anymore."

47:47.976 --> 47:50.448
- One time we did a
conference in Harlem,

47:50.481 --> 47:51.584
and it was a women's conference,

47:51.617 --> 47:53.053
and I remember
mentioning, I'm like,

47:53.087 --> 47:56.326
"Hey, you know, we
can't have a lineup

47:56.359 --> 47:59.132
"of white women in Harlem.

47:59.165 --> 48:00.602
"We shouldn't have it anyway,

48:00.635 --> 48:02.673
"but this is gonna
be a bad look,"

48:02.706 --> 48:06.547
and I was definitely met
with some resistance there.

48:06.581 --> 48:08.585
Oh, here comes Carl
again, he's the race guy.

48:10.121 --> 48:12.225
You know, I remember
being told sternly,

48:12.258 --> 48:13.661
we're not gonna do that.

48:13.695 --> 48:14.697
We're not gonna cater
to what people think,

48:14.730 --> 48:17.335
and we're not gonna
specialize certain races.

48:20.107 --> 48:22.211
I definitely quieted
down a little bit,

48:22.245 --> 48:23.615
'cause I hated that so much.

48:26.052 --> 48:29.159
It's tricky when you run
a church that you control,

48:29.192 --> 48:30.529
but you really don't,

48:30.562 --> 48:33.100
there're gonna be
moments of complication.

48:33.133 --> 48:35.471
(tense music)

48:37.175 --> 48:40.114
- I disconnected emotionally.

48:40.147 --> 48:42.218
I didn't even sing the
worship songs anymore.

48:43.555 --> 48:46.259
I stayed as long as my
daughter Ashley stayed,

48:46.293 --> 48:48.097
and when she said
she had enough,

48:48.130 --> 48:50.468
I said, "Okay, this
is it, let's go."

48:52.472 --> 48:56.647
After we left, Carl came to
visit me in my apartment.

48:58.417 --> 49:01.423
He said, "What did I do wrong?"

49:01.456 --> 49:04.295
And I said, "You
love basketball.

49:04.329 --> 49:06.166
"When you are shooting the ball,

49:06.199 --> 49:11.109
"you go up with the ball,
and then you follow through."

49:12.378 --> 49:14.082
I said, "That's your problem.

49:14.115 --> 49:16.386
"You don't follow through."

49:17.723 --> 49:19.459
And that's when
he started crying.

49:20.294 --> 49:22.633
(tense music)

49:26.707 --> 49:30.080
- To the people who
say I dropped the ball

49:30.114 --> 49:33.420
when it comes to the whole
question of race in church,

49:33.453 --> 49:34.690
and that I didn't do enough,

49:36.727 --> 49:39.299
I would reject that completely.

49:39.332 --> 49:42.506
Funny, I remember we had a
meeting in church one time,

49:42.539 --> 49:44.710
and I gathered some Black
leaders in our church,

49:46.213 --> 49:48.450
and it was a really good
meeting by and large.

49:48.483 --> 49:51.189
And then afterwards,
there was a lot of people

49:51.223 --> 49:54.630
who wanted to say thanks, and
then there were some people

49:54.663 --> 49:57.435
who had, you know,
issues with it.

49:57.468 --> 49:59.339
And that was the night,
you know I heard from,

49:59.372 --> 50:02.178
you know, a woman
of color who said,

50:02.211 --> 50:04.315
"You had a woman up there
who's married to a white man.

50:04.349 --> 50:06.453
"What's she doing up there?"

50:06.486 --> 50:09.225
We had another person
come up to me and say,

50:09.259 --> 50:11.731
"That person you had up there
doesn't represent my culture,

50:11.764 --> 50:13.200
"represents a
different culture,"

50:13.233 --> 50:15.337
and I remember that
night going like,

50:15.371 --> 50:20.247
"Wow, I gotta do what's in my
heart and what's best here,

50:21.551 --> 50:22.753
"because this isn't
gonna be something

50:22.786 --> 50:24.122
"that is gonna
please everybody."

50:25.792 --> 50:27.729
I do find it ironic
that I'm being asked

50:27.763 --> 50:29.465
about those questions
when I feel like

50:29.500 --> 50:31.737
that was one of the things
we did the absolute best.

50:31.771 --> 50:35.679
You know, I feel like we
cut new ground with that.

50:35.712 --> 50:36.814
And is it enough?

50:36.847 --> 50:38.618
I don't know, what is enough?

50:38.651 --> 50:40.622
So for the people who say
that he didn't do enough,

50:40.655 --> 50:43.093
what would be enough?

50:43.126 --> 50:47.268
I would get 100
different answers from
100 different people.

50:47.301 --> 50:48.571
I respect people's opinions.

50:48.605 --> 50:49.540
I have one too.

50:52.144 --> 50:54.683
(dramatic music)

50:58.190 --> 50:59.793
- Hillsong is
planting themselves

50:59.827 --> 51:02.331
in this very progressive city.

51:03.835 --> 51:06.273
They're saying
everybody's welcome here,

51:06.306 --> 51:09.412
and so you just give them
all the benefit of the doubt.

51:11.684 --> 51:16.159
Thinking about
like LGBTQ things,

51:16.192 --> 51:21.102
I knew what the
Christian stance was.

51:22.839 --> 51:26.346
I didn't know what
Hillsong's was.

51:26.379 --> 51:28.885
- I think the heart of our
church at that time was,

51:28.918 --> 51:31.691
we don't wanna upset
the religious apple cart

51:31.724 --> 51:33.260
that could affect
our bottom line,

51:34.563 --> 51:36.299
but we definitely
love all people.

51:36.333 --> 51:38.170
You can't have it both ways.

51:38.203 --> 51:40.207
'Cause if people find
out that, you know,

51:40.240 --> 51:43.280
Hillsong Church is, you know,
affirming to this person,

51:43.313 --> 51:45.284
and if Hillsong, boom, it
could affect our sales here,

51:45.317 --> 51:49.292
so under the radar, yes,
welcome, come one, come all.

51:50.260 --> 51:51.631
Outside, this is
Hillsong Church,

51:51.664 --> 51:53.534
we believe traditional
stuff here.

51:54.570 --> 51:56.306
- B
ecause we have to keep the
main thing the main thing,

51:56.339 --> 51:57.576
and the main thing is Jesus,

51:57.609 --> 51:59.278
and just getting people in here.

52:01.249 --> 52:04.657
But even if Hillsong
Church does have an issue

52:04.690 --> 52:07.295
with gay people, honestly,

52:07.328 --> 52:09.198
that's part of the
deal with Christianity,

52:09.232 --> 52:11.604
and you just kind of know that.

52:11.637 --> 52:14.309
(dramatic music)

52:14.342 --> 52:17.749
- Hillsong New York City never
spoke against homosexuality,

52:17.783 --> 52:19.620
they never spoke against
the gay community.

52:21.757 --> 52:25.865
Well of course your congregation
is filled with homosexuals.

52:25.899 --> 52:27.602
Like, of course we're there.

52:27.636 --> 52:32.178
What we're hearing sounds to
us like you're on our side,

52:33.781 --> 52:37.221
that you're with us, that we,
you're telling us we belong.

52:37.254 --> 52:38.891
Aren't you? Aren't you?

52:38.925 --> 52:40.027
- [Carl] This is
the kind of church

52:40.060 --> 52:42.866
where you come as you are,
not come as you should be.

52:42.899 --> 52:45.270
We love you, we're
glad you're here.

52:45.304 --> 52:47.341
- They're an evangelical,

52:47.375 --> 52:49.278
quasi-fundamentalist
Pentecostal church.

52:49.312 --> 52:51.216
Like of course they
believe these things.

52:51.249 --> 52:52.753
What did you all expect?

52:52.786 --> 52:55.792
(tense music)

52:55.825 --> 52:59.700
- I think Carl, while
a naturally easy person

52:59.733 --> 53:02.906
to peg all these issues on,

53:02.939 --> 53:05.779
is really just, he's
a cog, you know?

53:05.812 --> 53:07.849
I think he's a
pretty important cog,

53:07.883 --> 53:09.787
but the wheel is broken.

53:11.289 --> 53:12.926
Carl is just like
part of the mechanism

53:12.959 --> 53:14.563
that makes the wheel turn.

53:14.596 --> 53:17.201
(tense music)

53:18.671 --> 53:20.274
- Did I ever try
to leave Hillsong?

53:21.443 --> 53:25.384
We were definitely at a place

53:25.417 --> 53:27.522
where we knew our time was up.

53:27.556 --> 53:29.526
I did have some
conversations with Brian,

53:29.560 --> 53:32.699
and, you know, we came to an
agreement that we wouldn't.

53:34.368 --> 53:35.872
But it comes a time where

53:35.905 --> 53:38.276
the most respectful
thing you can do

53:38.310 --> 53:40.013
is to do something different,

53:40.047 --> 53:43.286
and so I think that's where
I was headed for sure.

53:43.320 --> 53:46.326
Rather than be a
contentious player,

53:46.359 --> 53:47.829
you just gotta go
to a different game.

53:57.816 --> 54:00.822
ity pastor

54:00.855 --> 54:03.828
having an affair, to be honest,

54:03.861 --> 54:05.297
felt pretty pedestrian to me.

54:05.330 --> 54:06.667
It happens all of the time.

54:08.638 --> 54:10.842
The more Dan and I
talked about it though,

54:10.875 --> 54:13.447
the more reading we did,

54:13.480 --> 54:16.319
it seemed to me that there
was something else larger

54:16.352 --> 54:18.991
that was happening
at this church.

54:19.025 --> 54:20.862
What was most
shocking about the way

54:20.895 --> 54:23.868
that Brian dealt with
the Carl situation,

54:23.901 --> 54:27.308
was that for years, for decades,

54:27.341 --> 54:30.849
Hillsong had been
giving grace to pastors

54:30.882 --> 54:32.719
who had really messed up.

54:32.752 --> 54:35.725
Sweeping it under the
rug, making it go away.

54:35.758 --> 54:38.498
This was an instance
where we had a pastor

54:38.531 --> 54:40.869
who really messed up, you
know, they got rid of him,

54:40.902 --> 54:43.006
and they did it really publicly.

54:43.039 --> 54:45.645
They did it on TV, they
did it in the newspapers,

54:45.678 --> 54:47.749
they leaked audio.

54:47.782 --> 54:50.020
That is one of the
sort of what we call

54:50.053 --> 54:51.489
the black swans, right?

54:51.524 --> 54:52.893
Like it's the thing
that sticks out,

54:52.926 --> 54:54.596
it doesn't make a lot of sense.

54:54.630 --> 54:57.636
- Historically, people who
have crossed Brian Houston

54:57.669 --> 55:00.608
aren't really heard from
again in a Hillsong context.

55:00.642 --> 55:03.781
That happened to Carl
a couple of years ago,

55:03.815 --> 55:06.921
and it happened to Geoff
Bullock a few decades earlier.

55:06.954 --> 55:09.458
Geoff is one of the
most influential figures

55:09.492 --> 55:11.864
in contemporary Christian music.

55:11.897 --> 55:13.968
In his world, he's like Nirvana.

55:18.076 --> 55:22.919
(birds chirping)
(solemn music)

55:25.959 --> 55:30.602
- I was the initial Creative
Minister at Hillsong.

55:30.635 --> 55:32.606
I was part of the
group of people

55:32.639 --> 55:34.743
that pioneered the church
with Brian Houston.

55:36.514 --> 55:39.520
We went from being, you
know, just an Aussie church,

55:39.553 --> 55:42.926
having a whole lot of fun,
to being more corporatized.

55:44.830 --> 55:46.934
I said to Brian, "Look,
we've worked together

55:46.967 --> 55:49.840
"for these past 12 years.

55:49.873 --> 55:53.548
"You are my family, but
I've gotta tell you,

55:53.581 --> 55:57.556
"we are doing things where
we are pushing all our people

55:57.589 --> 55:58.791
"to the limit."

56:00.695 --> 56:02.499
Brian just said to me,

56:02.532 --> 56:06.072
"It's not your job to
come to senior management

56:06.105 --> 56:08.544
"to represent the
rights of the workers.

56:08.578 --> 56:10.447
"No.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.684
"If they don't like it, tell
them to go to another church

56:11.717 --> 56:12.919
"and we'll find somebody else."

56:15.457 --> 56:16.927
Brian's anger is legendary.

56:18.898 --> 56:20.668
He called it strong leadership.

56:23.173 --> 56:26.547
There was a time when Brian
and I were flying to LA.

56:27.782 --> 56:30.555
Brian loved to have his
business class seat.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.594
His secretary somehow
couldn't get that seat,

56:33.628 --> 56:36.567
so he reduced her to tears.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.436
He just yelled, and
yelled, and yelled.

56:38.470 --> 56:42.979
- There is a God of
Israel who is alive,

56:43.013 --> 56:44.549
and who can overcome every--

56:44.583 --> 56:46.820
- I started to see
the angry Brian,

56:46.854 --> 56:51.429
the Brian that often struggled
with how I did things.

56:51.462 --> 56:54.135
I had to perform the way
he wanted me to perform.

56:56.507 --> 57:00.180
I was struggling with
the intense pressure

57:00.213 --> 57:03.453
on me to be somebody
that I wasn't.

57:04.488 --> 57:05.558
I just couldn't go on.

57:06.961 --> 57:08.096
And I decided I had to leave.

57:10.868 --> 57:15.444
In the space of three months,
I lost all of my friends.

57:16.780 --> 57:17.983
I lost my church family.

57:19.886 --> 57:23.126
My wife left me,
I got ostracized.

57:24.663 --> 57:26.767
Brian wrote a letter to
all the music directors,

57:26.800 --> 57:29.740
saying that they can't
sing any of the new songs

57:29.773 --> 57:31.644
that I would write.

57:34.683 --> 57:38.056
I got a phone call in early
2000's from Nabi Saleh,

57:38.089 --> 57:41.029
one of the senior
elders of Hillsong,

57:41.062 --> 57:42.799
saying, "Look, I'd love
to get together with you,"

57:42.832 --> 57:45.738
and we sat down
and ordered coffee,

57:45.772 --> 57:48.778
and he looked me in
the eyes and he said,

57:48.811 --> 57:52.017
"Geoff, you do know we
tried to destroy you."

57:53.053 --> 57:56.527
And I said to him, "Nabi, why?"

57:56.560 --> 57:58.029
And he said,

57:58.063 --> 57:59.198
"Because we thought you
were gonna bring us down."

57:59.231 --> 58:01.770
(tense music)

58:04.710 --> 58:05.912
- [Reporter] Right now on GMA

58:05.945 --> 58:06.980
with that dramatic
fall from grace

58:07.014 --> 58:09.218
for celebrity pastor Carl Lentz.

58:09.251 --> 58:11.657
- [Reporter] They began what
she calls a consensual affair.

58:11.690 --> 58:14.228
- [Reporter] Is reportedly
now seeking outside help,

58:14.261 --> 58:17.034
following his recent ouster
and marital infidelity.

58:20.575 --> 58:23.781
- After the barrage, there was
a couple months of silence,

58:23.814 --> 58:27.254
and Brian randomly goes on TV
for this terrible interview.

58:27.287 --> 58:29.526
And then he starts
talking about me again.

58:29.559 --> 58:32.131
I remember going like,
"Why is he doing this?"

58:32.164 --> 58:34.068
Like, why does he keep...

58:34.101 --> 58:35.538
He doesn't need to do this.

58:35.571 --> 58:39.980
I was trying to get
my wellbeing back,

58:40.013 --> 58:41.617
and out of the corner my
eye, I'm going, "What?"

58:41.650 --> 58:44.155
Like, this guy's
on TV saying what?

58:44.188 --> 58:46.259
- Carl is Carl, he's
a unique character.

58:46.292 --> 58:48.964
There's a lot of things
I miss about Carl.

58:48.998 --> 58:50.668
But having said that,

58:50.702 --> 58:54.576
there were leadership issues
that I believe included lying,

58:54.609 --> 58:57.682
included what I would call
narcissistic behavior.

59:02.726 --> 59:05.865
- The first rule of power is
don't outshine the master.

59:08.036 --> 59:10.307
You don't show up your boss,

59:10.340 --> 59:12.712
and that's 100%
what Carl had done.

59:15.183 --> 59:17.622
- Carl overtook the brand.

59:17.655 --> 59:20.762
Brian went scorched earth,

59:20.795 --> 59:24.836
just to ruin his chances of
surviving outside of Hillsong.

59:26.774 --> 59:30.615
The rumor is that
Carl was planning

59:30.648 --> 59:32.251
to leave Hillsong anyway.

59:34.021 --> 59:35.625
If he wanted to
start a new church,

59:35.658 --> 59:37.294
Carl would've
taken a hefty chunk

59:37.327 --> 59:39.966
of Hillsong's congregations.

59:42.070 --> 59:44.810
People and money,
mostly the money.

59:44.843 --> 59:47.247
(tense music)

59:52.725 --> 59:55.297
- I think of Carl
Lentz as Lucifer.

59:55.330 --> 59:59.338
He was so beautiful, and he
was growing in power so much,

59:59.371 --> 01:00:01.309
that he almost thought
he could be Brian,

01:00:02.979 --> 01:00:05.283
and he had to be
thrown out of heaven.

01:00:07.722 --> 01:00:09.826
- Pastors everywhere,
and in Hillsong church,

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.932
deal with things, and depending
on how you get caught,

01:00:12.966 --> 01:00:16.105
depending on who you are, that
depends on how we treat it.

01:00:16.139 --> 01:00:17.374
- [Reporter] There
are some people

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:19.211
at Hillsong Church
who face scandals,

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.349
and those scandals get
swept under the rug.

01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.856
And then there are other
people who are valuable assets,

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:28.764
or even shining stars, and
they end up getting buried.

01:00:28.798 --> 01:00:32.806
- Maybe they just thought that
they had crushed this so much

01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:36.245
that, you know, we were just
gonna vanish into thin air,

01:00:36.279 --> 01:00:39.351
and to a degree we
did, and we might,

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:42.090
but God reveals what
he wants to reveal.

01:00:42.124 --> 01:00:43.928
(journalists chattering)

01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:46.365
And that train is not
stopping anytime soon.

01:00:46.399 --> 01:00:48.269
- The whole truth.
- The whole truth.

01:00:48.303 --> 01:00:51.108
- And nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.041
(engaging jazz music)

01:01:24.074 --> 01:01:26.245
- [Carl] The calling is
explosive and we need it.

01:01:27.782 --> 01:01:30.287
Don't let the devil rob
you of an opportunity

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.190
to have a hand in
the greatest group

01:01:32.224 --> 01:01:34.161
of God history has ever seen.

01:01:34.195 --> 01:01:37.401
(engaging jazz music)

01:01:42.779 --> 01:01:45.885
(engaging jazz music)

01:01:49.158 --> 01:01:52.431
The purpose of Jesus
saving your life...

01:01:56.038 --> 01:01:58.877
(cameras clicking)

01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:01.783
(orchestral music)
