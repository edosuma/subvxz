-Hi, Rose.
-We brought dinner.

01:00.100 --> 01:03.367
-What'd you get?
-A bucket of chicken.

01:10.266 --> 01:13.000
I hope you like it extra flat and crispy.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.166
It's a pizza, Rose.

01:17.233 --> 01:19.500
I knew that,
I just meant what kind?

01:19.567 --> 01:24.066
-Did you really know that?
-No. But I thought I could cover.

01:26.867 --> 01:29.533
I'm glad you're all here.
I want you to try something.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.834
Here, taste this.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.967
-What do you think?
-It's water.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.800
I didn't ask you to identify it,
I asked you what you thought.

01:38.433 --> 01:40.300
-It's good.
-Just good?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.700
Mmm. Very good.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.800
How would you describe the taste?

01:44.867 --> 01:48.633
-Refreshing, clear, clean...
-Would you buy this water?

01:48.700 --> 01:50.300
-Sure, why not?
-Absolutely.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.633
We're rich. We're rich.
It comes from the hose out back.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.967
Move over Perrier,
Petrillo water is on the way.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.100
-Ma...
-I know what you're gonna say.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.266
Another one of my
get-rich-quick schemes.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.033
This is different. I've been
working on this since noon.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.467
Ma, when are you gonna learn

02:10.533 --> 02:13.800
that these money-making gimmicks
of yours never work?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.433
I'm not the only one with big dreams.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.033
I remember when we all thought
catering was the ticket.

02:18.100 --> 02:22.000
-Do you remember that?
-(all groaning)

02:25.100 --> 02:28.867
Girls, this time I think we
have really hit the jackpot.

02:28.934 --> 02:30.033
Oh, me too.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.633
This wedding consultant business
is the smartest thing we've ever done.

02:33.700 --> 02:38.333
I'm a little nervous about tomorrow.
I've never cooked for 300 people.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.500
Please, in Sicily, we did it all the time.

02:40.567 --> 02:43.633
And we didn't have the modern
conveniences you have today.

02:43.967 --> 02:47.500
We had to slaughter our own meat,
prepare our own seasonings,

02:47.567 --> 02:51.433
and, if the food wasn't perfect,
after cappuccino, they shot the cook.

02:53.934 --> 02:55.633
Ma, you're making that up.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.600
No. Why do you think there
are only two guys from Italy?

03:00.700 --> 03:01.900
(bell rings)

03:01.967 --> 03:03.767
Oh, places everybody.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Hit it.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.100
You know, this is boring.

03:26.033 --> 03:28.734
I know how we could
make the time go faster.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.367
We could sing a work song,
like they do on the railroad.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.667
Just follow my lead.

Maybe it's a Jehovah's witness
with a caffeine problem.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.700
-All right. Maybe we should go see.
-Yeah.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.667
Maybe we should have a weapon.

04:14.734 --> 04:17.667
The three of you without make-up
is enough to scare anyone.

04:24.367 --> 04:26.333
-Who is it?
-It's Priscilla.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.834
Priscilla?

04:29.233 --> 04:32.767
You're getting married tomorrow.
You should be in bed.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.633
-There's not gonna be a wedding.
-The hell there isn't.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.767
Sorry, dear, you were saying?

04:39.433 --> 04:40.967
Ramone and I had a fight.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.867
I decided I'm not gonna marry him.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.867
Oh, honey, now that's ridiculous

04:44.934 --> 04:48.100
to call off your wedding because
of a silly little argument.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.567
-What did Ramone do?
-He slept with my best friend.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.967
We're gonna eat chicken
for the rest of our lives.

04:55.433 --> 04:59.367
Oh, Priscilla, I'm so sorry.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.467
Listen. Be grateful he got it out
of his system before the marriage.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.367
It'll give you something
to make him feel guilty about.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.867
Most women go through three,
four years of marriage

05:10.934 --> 05:12.300
for ammunition like that.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.900
(telephone rings)

05:16.934 --> 05:19.400
Hello, Miami Mom's catering.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.667
It's Ramone.

05:21.734 --> 05:24.033
Tell him he's the scum of the earth.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.867
She says that you are
the scum of the earth.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.734
But, uh, she said it with
a lot of love in her eyes.

05:32.734 --> 05:35.333
-He says he's sorry.
-Do you hear that?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.767
Darling, he's sorry. So I guess
that settles everything, okay?

05:38.834 --> 05:40.433
We'll see you at your wedding.

05:40.934 --> 05:43.567
Girls! Wait a minute.

05:44.066 --> 05:47.467
We're talking about the sacred
institution of marriage here.

05:47.533 --> 05:50.700
Are you willing to sacrifice
the happiness of these two kids

05:50.767 --> 05:53.500
-for the almighty dollar?
-(all) Yes.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.033
I just want to be sure we're in agreement.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.066
Ramone, I'm gonna
put Priscilla on now.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.200
I... just talk to him.

06:08.834 --> 06:09.834
Hello?

06:10.834 --> 06:12.767
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

06:13.467 --> 06:16.266
Uh-huh. Okay. Goodbye.

06:18.734 --> 06:19.867
We're back together.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.433
Sometimes when you really
talk things out like that,

06:25.500 --> 06:26.900
you solve everything.

06:28.867 --> 06:30.500
I can't thank you ladies enough.

06:30.567 --> 06:34.000
We're so much in love. Ramone
can't even wait until tomorrow.

06:34.066 --> 06:37.300
-Oh, isn't that sweet.
-We're eloping to Las Vegas.

06:37.367 --> 06:40.133
-You're what?
-He's booking the flight now.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.700
-Congratulations, darling.
-Congratulations?

06:43.767 --> 06:46.567
Listen, we were going to give
you your wedding gift tomorrow,

06:46.633 --> 06:50.633
but since we won't see you, why
don't you take it home tonight.

06:51.834 --> 06:52.967
Thank you.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.000
(Blanche) Good night.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.333
Dorothy, are you crazy?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.800
We're gonna lose a fortune
on this wedding.

06:59.867 --> 07:03.200
And you let her march out that
door with your best crystal.

07:03.266 --> 07:06.066
Hello, police?
I'd like to report a robbery.

07:10.734 --> 07:14.734
But that wasn't a scheme, Sophia,
that was a legitimate business.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.600
And we lost our shirts.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.600
That's the beauty of this water thing.
You can't lose.

07:19.834 --> 07:22.000
It's a rip off, pure and simple.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.734
That's why the French were
first to come up with it.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.033
Sophia, why are you
so obsessed with money?

07:33.300 --> 07:35.367
Because I wanna buy a TV for my bedroom.

07:35.433 --> 07:38.633
Ma, we have a perfectly good
TV set in the living room.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.633
Yeah, but you never
let me watch what I like.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.133
And I wanna make sure
I don't miss that final episode

07:43.200 --> 07:45.266
of <i>M*A*S*H</i> I've been hearing
so much about.

07:46.100 --> 07:50.000
Sophia, honey, that show
hasn't been on in years.

07:50.767 --> 07:52.066
Is <i>Hotel</i> still on?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.533
Yes.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.867
<i>Hotel</i> is still on and <i>M*A*S*H</i> isn't?

07:57.500 --> 07:59.233
How gullible do you think I am?

07:59.667 --> 08:00.900
Do I look like Donna Rice?

08:07.700 --> 08:10.166
You know, ma, I seem
to remember another time

08:10.233 --> 08:13.300
you were trying to make extra
money to buy a TV set.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.767
Do you happen to be talking
about Brooklyn, April 1954.

08:17.834 --> 08:21.467
You remember that, but you don't
know that <i>M*A*S*H</i> is off the air.

08:21.967 --> 08:25.000
Ah, shut up and stroll with me down memory
lane.

08:25.066 --> 08:28.667
I'd taken in some sewing.
It was a couple of weeks before Easter.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.633
-I'm home.
-Oh, call the <i>New York Times.</i>

08:41.033 --> 08:42.066
What's for dinner?

08:42.133 --> 08:45.633
Pierre is writing today's selections
on the blackboard in the kitchen.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.800
-(Salvadore) Ow, my tooth!
-Oh, yeah, I forgot.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.100
Stay away from the food on the table,
it's wax.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.300
(knock on door)

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
Hi, ma.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.533
Dorothy, I didn't know you were coming.
Bring the kids?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.233
No, I wanted to talk to you alone.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.266
-Sal, Dorothy's here.
-(Sal) Did she bring the kids?

09:05.333 --> 09:08.133
Hi, pop. No, the kids are at home.

09:08.533 --> 09:11.400
(Sal) Hey, what the hell is this?
I thought dinner was in the oven.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.867
-It's a tin plate.
-Take the foil off the top.

09:14.934 --> 09:17.100
It's something new.
It's called a TV dinner.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.500
The wax fruit looks better.

09:22.233 --> 09:26.367
Ma, I need to ask you a favor.
I wanna get a part-time job

09:26.433 --> 09:29.133
and I was wondering if you could
watch the kids two days a week.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.900
Stan lost his job. I told you
that yutz is a deadbeat.

09:33.867 --> 09:37.767
-Stan did not lose his job.
-His job he could afford to lose.

09:37.834 --> 09:41.100
A novelty salesman. The novelty
would be if he made a sale.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.433
(Sal) Don't listen to your mother.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.633
There's a big market
for novelties.

09:46.700 --> 09:50.333
That plastic dog doo we snuck
into Charlie's lunch pail,

09:50.533 --> 09:51.667
that was a scream.

09:51.934 --> 09:54.667
I'll bet his Cocker Spaniel will
catch hell for that tonight.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.266
Lucky me. I'm married to the Noël Coward
of Canarsie.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.266
I just want to pick up
a couple of extra dollars

10:02.333 --> 10:04.800
so we can buy
a television set.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.300
-No.
-What?

10:06.367 --> 10:08.066
No, I won't watch the kids.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.367
But you love it when the kids
come over for a visit.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.734
That's not the point.
Don't throw away money.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.567
This TV thing is just a fad.

10:15.934 --> 10:19.066
(Sal) Hey, did you know this
turkey comes with stuffing?

10:19.133 --> 10:21.200
Ma, TV is not a fad.

10:21.266 --> 10:24.133
Otherwise Swanson would have
called those radio dinners.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.300
I told you, no.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.300
(Sal) I didn't know these
were mashed potatoes.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.700
They don't have
lumps like yours.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.433
You want lumps, Salvadore,
I'll give you lumps.

10:35.934 --> 10:39.734
Ma, I cannot believe you are
so old-fashioned in your thinking.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.633
I said no and it's no.
I'm too busy to have this argument.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.367
Fine. I'll just leave
the kids with Stan's mother.

10:46.433 --> 10:48.433
Over my dead body.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.133
That gorilla scares the children.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.967
Your Michael didn't sleep for
a week after he saw her last time.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.967
Ma, that is enough.

10:55.033 --> 10:57.834
One way or another,
I am going to earn that money.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.867
(Sal)
Sophia, would you just tell her

10:59.934 --> 11:02.333
so your husband
can enjoy his meal in peace.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.867
Tell me what?

11:03.934 --> 11:06.700
(Sal)
These peas taste just like fresh.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.700
But you can't mix them
with the mashed potatoes.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.266
They should have a tunnel
running from the pea compartment

11:12.333 --> 11:14.266
to the mashed potato compartment.

11:16.266 --> 11:19.567
Ma, what is pop talking about?
What should you tell me?

11:19.633 --> 11:21.367
All right, all right.

11:21.433 --> 11:23.066
It's your tenth anniversary,

11:23.133 --> 11:26.934
your father and I decided
to buy you a TV set as a gift.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Ma, you can't afford that.

11:29.066 --> 11:30.567
That's why I'm doing alterations.

11:30.633 --> 11:33.166
You think I need a wardrobe
this size to go to Mulberry Street

11:33.233 --> 11:34.500
and squeeze a zucchini?

11:36.767 --> 11:38.200
(laughing) Oh, Ma.

11:38.266 --> 11:39.333
What's so funny?

11:40.667 --> 11:41.934
I lied.

11:42.867 --> 11:47.000
I wanted the job so we could
buy pop a TV for his birthday.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.934
Then it's settled.
You buy us one, we'll buy you one.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.300
-It's a deal.
-Sure.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.767
Then your father can go
watch the Friday night fights

11:56.834 --> 11:58.166
with your yutz of a husband,

11:58.233 --> 12:00.767
you come here and watch
<i>Person to Person</i> with me,

12:00.834 --> 12:03.066
and maybe once a week
the whole family can come over

12:03.133 --> 12:05.934
and watch that new show,
<i>Make Room for Daddy.</i>

12:06.000 --> 12:07.233
Thanks, Ma.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.834
-Where are you going?
-Get some air.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.767
-We got air in the house.
-I like beer with my air.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.834
-(Sal) You'll wait up for me?
-Don't I always?

12:26.500 --> 12:29.333
-(Sal) I love you.
-I love you too.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.867
I look at him,
I see Errol Flynn.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.333
-That pizza was delicious.
-The best.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.934
There's still one piece left,
who wants it?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.400
-I do.
-I do.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.033
Well, I can split it three ways.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.433
What am I supposed to do,
lick the box?

13:01.166 --> 13:04.567
Ma, you don't like store bought
pizza, you prefer homemade.

13:04.633 --> 13:07.467
I also prefer milk straight
from a cow. I adapt.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.166
This is awful.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.767
Ma, if you weren't going to eat it,
why did you take it?

13:25.834 --> 13:28.667
It's the principle. You're
always leaving me out of things.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.767
Now, Sophia, that's not true.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.166
The hell it isn't.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.367
What about that dance marathon
you cut me out of?

13:34.433 --> 13:36.667
Now come on, Ma.
That was different.

13:36.734 --> 13:38.166
There was money at stake.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.734
We didn't even tell
each other about that.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.300
I remember I was the first
one to arrive, remember?

13:44.367 --> 13:46.400
And I was wearing that
blue sequined dress...

13:47.400 --> 13:49.166
(big band music plays)

13:49.233 --> 13:52.800
Will you quit complaining, Marty?
It's gonna be fun.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.500
You said we were going
dancing tonight.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.100
You failed to mention
it was a dance marathon.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.967
Well, the first prize is $1000
and I have to have that money.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.700
I'm in desperate need
of medical attention.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.233
-Is it serious?
-Very.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.066
If I can't afford
a new fall wardrobe,

14:09.133 --> 14:11.066
I'll never land myself a doctor.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.667
No offense, Marty.

14:13.734 --> 14:17.066
You know, sometimes I don't
think you're serious about me.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.734
Don't be silly.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.500
I love you as much
as I could any dry cleaner.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.200
Run and get us a number.
Go on.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.066
Why, hello there, Blanche.

14:35.133 --> 14:38.000
Well, Dorothy. Russ, hi.
What are you all doing here?

14:38.066 --> 14:40.700
Russell and I just entered
the dance marathon.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.367
-Really, so did I.
-Yes. It's for charity.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.033
I thought it would be fun.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.767
Well, have yourself a good time.
Try not to overdo it.

14:48.834 --> 14:52.567
Blanche,
what is that supposed to mean?

14:52.633 --> 14:53.900
Oh, nothing.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.533
Just that these things
can be a little strenuous

14:56.600 --> 14:58.166
for a woman of your years.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.934
Who am I, Minnie Eisenhower?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.133
I can last just
as long as you can.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.333
(laughing) Oh, Dorothy, please.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.066
I think I do have a little
more endurance than you.

15:11.133 --> 15:13.767
Blanche, we are not
dancing on our backs.

15:21.233 --> 15:23.433
-You take that back.
-I will not.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.333
You just implied
that I'm an old lady.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.967
Oh, well, honey,
I didn't mean to imply it.

15:28.033 --> 15:30.000
I meant to say it flat out.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.266
You know what your problem is,
Blanche?

15:32.333 --> 15:34.667
You can't stand
a little competition.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.333
Which is why you tried
to keep this a secret.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.867
I notice you're here too, Dorothy.

15:38.934 --> 15:41.834
So you tried to keep
it a secret from me.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.233
Hi, girls.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.500
<i>Et Tu,</i> Judas?

15:48.166 --> 15:51.233
No, it's me, Rose.
My hair's a little different.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.767
So you two found out
about this thing too?

15:57.834 --> 15:59.200
-Mm-hmm.
-That's right.

15:59.266 --> 16:01.066
Let me give you
some friendly advice.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.767
You're wasting your time.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.166
'Cause that thousand dollar
prize is gonna be mine.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.100
When I was younger,
I was known as the dancing fool.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.934
How old were you when they
dropped the "dancing" part?

16:16.333 --> 16:18.333
(drum roll)

16:18.400 --> 16:21.734
Yowza, yowza, yowza,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.533
And welcome to the thirteenth
annual Jefferson hospital

16:25.600 --> 16:29.367
heart charity dance marathon.
Yes, sir.

16:29.433 --> 16:31.233
(applause)

16:31.300 --> 16:33.600
One word of caution
before we begin.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.900
Contrary to what some folks
thought last year,

16:36.967 --> 16:41.467
this marathon is not part of
the cardiac rehabilitation program

16:41.533 --> 16:43.433
here at the hospital.

16:43.500 --> 16:47.800
If any of you toe tappers have
more than 30 percent blockage,

16:47.867 --> 16:50.500
we implore you to leave
the dance floor at this time.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.834
All right, now.
Let's let the dance marathon begin!

16:56.900 --> 16:58.500
A one, two, three, four.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.400
(music plays)

17:04.333 --> 17:06.200
Blanche, you're not
gonna believe this.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.467
I twisted my ankle.
I'm not gonna be able to dance.

17:08.533 --> 17:09.800
No, no, no, you have to.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.600
I can't believe you'd force me
to dance all night in pain.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.600
I mean, if you win, you said
you were gonna take all the money.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.200
What do I get out of this evening?

17:17.266 --> 17:18.800
Come here.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.900
Let's samba.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.967
(slower big band music plays)

17:42.667 --> 17:45.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
our charity dance marathon

17:45.367 --> 17:48.433
is now entering
its seventh hour.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.033
Let's give our contestants
a great big hand.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.200
(applause)

17:57.467 --> 17:59.100
Hi, girls, how are
you holding up?

17:59.166 --> 18:01.567
-Oh, fine, just fine.
-Terrific.

18:01.633 --> 18:04.934
You know, this reminds me of
the big dance back in St. Olaf

18:05.000 --> 18:06.600
to kick off pretzel week.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.400
My uncle Gunther, after
the great beer nut shortage of 21...

18:09.467 --> 18:11.767
Foul! Send a judge over here.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.367
This woman is trying
to put us to sleep.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.500
You're just exhausted
and you're trying to blame it on me.

18:21.567 --> 18:25.400
Exhausted?
I'll show you who's exhausted.

18:25.467 --> 18:29.834
Maestro. How about something
with a little... octane.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.133
Okay, little lady.
All right, boys! Take it away!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.800
A one, two, a one, two, three, four.

18:58.734 --> 19:01.300
(Blanche) Out of my way, amateurs.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.100
(crowd whoops)

19:15.633 --> 19:18.333
Blanche, mind if I give it a try?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.000
Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.

19:21.066 --> 19:22.934
No, Dave, I better
do this by myself.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.300
You might get hurt.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.567
Three, four...

19:30.633 --> 19:32.233
(drum music plays)

19:32.300 --> 19:34.433
(crowd whistles)

20:09.633 --> 20:12.667
It looks like
it's going to be a long night.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.633
(slower music plays)

20:28.467 --> 20:31.533
Ladies and gentlemen,
a nice round of applause

20:31.600 --> 20:37.367
for our four remaining couples
as we enter lucky hour 13.

20:37.433 --> 20:38.834
(applause)

20:38.900 --> 20:43.533
And a special round of applause
for that spunky Nick Montavesti.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.066
He outran enemy fire at Iwo Jima

20:48.133 --> 20:51.734
but phlebitis is the enemy
he couldn't outrun tonight.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.100
And now, it's time to tango.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.100
(tango music plays)

21:02.000 --> 21:03.633
-Blanche, I can't.
-No.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.900
-I can't go on.
-No, you have to.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.667
Just a little while longer
and I'll have that thousand.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.767
And you will have a wonderful
story to tell your poker club.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.166
No, I'm sorry, Blanche.
I quit.

21:13.233 --> 21:14.467
-Don't you dare.
-No, I quit.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.433
-No.
-Marty!

21:16.500 --> 21:21.667
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like
couple 29 is out of the competition.

21:21.734 --> 21:23.967
And that little lady
on the dance floor

21:24.033 --> 21:26.834
is out too unless
she can find a new partner

21:26.900 --> 21:28.867
within the next minute.

21:28.934 --> 21:30.633
(laughing)

21:32.667 --> 21:34.300
Oh, yeah?

21:34.367 --> 21:36.133
Excuse me, sir. Listen.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.033
Would you consider dumping your
partner and dancing with me?

21:40.100 --> 21:44.200
Listen, sir. Excuse me.
Would you consider it if I...

21:53.066 --> 21:56.667
(grunts in pain)
Dorothy, Dorothy!

21:56.734 --> 21:58.266
I got a Charlie horse.

21:58.333 --> 22:02.133
-I can't make it.
-Shake it off, wimp!

22:02.633 --> 22:04.633
I can't.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.967
Russell, come back.
Come back here.

22:08.033 --> 22:11.100
Come back here! Russell!

22:13.533 --> 22:16.300
Looks like it's just you and me,
Blanche.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.200
Rose, I'm afraid I have to leave.

22:19.266 --> 22:20.633
Are you in pain?

22:20.700 --> 22:24.300
I will be if my wife catches me
and she just walked in.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.166
David! David!

22:27.233 --> 22:30.567
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like we have a winner.

22:30.633 --> 22:33.266
Couple number 29!

22:33.333 --> 22:36.800
That's me. I won. I won!

22:36.867 --> 22:39.467
I won! I won!

22:39.533 --> 22:42.100
Just a minute, it's not over yet.

22:42.166 --> 22:47.367
It looks like we have another
couple reentering the floor.

23:10.433 --> 23:13.467
I will never forget the look
on your face when Dorothy and I

23:13.533 --> 23:15.033
tangoed on to the floor.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.233
And I will never forget
the look on your faces

23:17.300 --> 23:21.066
when you were disqualified
and I won the thousand dollars.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.567
And it was so sporting
of you to share your winnings.

23:24.633 --> 23:28.133
With my $10 I got that
can opener I always wanted.

23:30.066 --> 23:32.300
Don't say no, just hear me out.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.700
-Do you think I'm cute?
-Oh, Ma.

23:34.767 --> 23:38.467
-Just answer.
-Yes, Ma, I think you're cute.

23:38.533 --> 23:40.633
Would you say cute
verging on adorable?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.900
Sophia, what's this all about?

23:42.967 --> 23:46.233
Just picture my face on this jar
filled with my tomato sauce.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.934
We could put Paul Newman
out of business.

23:49.867 --> 23:51.367
Ma, if you had your choice

23:51.433 --> 23:53.967
of a spaghetti sauce
with your picture on it

23:54.033 --> 23:57.133
or Paul Newman's picture on it,
which would you choose?

23:58.767 --> 24:00.066
Back to square one.

24:09.233 --> 24:14.600
(theme music playing)
