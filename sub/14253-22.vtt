WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:08.236
Captain's Log, Stardate 53896.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.869
B'Elanna Torres
has requested permission

00:11.945 --> 00:18.180
to take the Delta Flyer
and search for dilithium.

00:18.251 --> 00:22.517
Shining Voyager, far from home,

00:22.589 --> 00:26.184
far from the gleaming cities
of Earth.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.590
Headstrong B'Elanna Torres

00:27.660 --> 00:29.423
and young Harry Kim

00:29.496 --> 00:33.557
speed away from Voyager
on the Delta Flyer

00:33.633 --> 00:35.225
in search of their treasures.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.632
l've trimmed the sails,

00:36.736 --> 00:37.964
but the sea is rough.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.538
Maybe we should return.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.733
l know what l'm doing.

00:41.841 --> 00:47.677
A wave as high as a mountain
struck the Delta Flyer.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.374
Get into the escape pod.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.814
We die together.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.442
No one is going to die.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.009
Go.

00:54.087 --> 00:57.682
Young Harry Kim left her side

00:57.757 --> 01:02.888
and B'Elanna Torres
was thrown against the rocks

01:02.962 --> 01:06.398
the rocks of our very shore.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.924
Which is where l,
Kelis the Poet,

01:10.003 --> 01:11.595
found her...

01:11.704 --> 01:13.672
broken...

01:13.773 --> 01:14.933
dying.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.139
She told me her story...

01:20.013 --> 01:22.038
...and now l've told you.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.198 --> 01:41.895
An excellent conceit, that
you discovered her yourself.

01:42.001 --> 01:42.968
Thank you.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.899
Well, now that B'Elanna Torres

01:45.004 --> 01:47.302
has come to our shore,
what will happen?

01:47.373 --> 01:49.864
Does Captain Janeway
come searching for her,

01:49.976 --> 01:51.876
or does she give her up
for lost?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.537
Who can say?

01:53.613 --> 01:55.137
Well, l would hope that you can.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.217
l want to see more
of these Voyager Eternals.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.412
lnspiration...

02:01.488 --> 02:03.388
can't be forced.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.720
One week.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.453
Or three weeks.

02:07.527 --> 02:08.585
Uh, maybe two.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.193
One week.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.233
The story will continue.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.404
Have you noticed how thin
my performers have gotten?

02:23.276 --> 02:24.504
Let them eat this.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.820
Ladies and gentlemen- -

02:36.890 --> 02:39.415
our patron salutes you.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.254
Finally!

02:41.327 --> 02:44.956
We're doing
another Voyager play...

02:45.031 --> 02:46.999
as soon as l can write it.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.934
Shall we celebrate,
the two of us?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.438
l have very little time.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.371
Celebrating will have to wait.

03:34.814 --> 03:35.940
Who are you?!

03:36.015 --> 03:39.974
Kelis... Kelis, the Poet.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.822
Your servant.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.391
My servant.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.595
All right.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.173
Then let me go.

05:41.274 --> 05:44.243
l... can't.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.971
Why not?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.370
You'll fly from me...

05:49.449 --> 05:52.043
the way inspiration always does.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.851
You're trying to kill me.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.360
l'm releasing the heat
from your veins.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.486
What are you talking about?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.656
You've been in a fever
since l found you.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.666
Bleeding is the best way
to treat it.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.827
Oh, l can see l'm in good hands.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.664
Something tells me
you have your doubts.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.536
There's a medkit over there.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.037
A box.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.341
Made out of metal?

06:22.949 --> 06:24.814
There's a small cylinder inside.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.411
Bring it here.

06:34.293 --> 06:35.590
Give it to me.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.436
Don't be afraid.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.803
lt won't hurt you.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.675
Here.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.974
Pass it over where you cut me.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.692
You're an Eternal.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.396
l suppose such things
are to be expected.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.871
What other things do you
expect from an Eternal?

07:21.941 --> 07:26.071
The power to make the ground
open up and the sky to fall.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.672
All the strange events
sung by the ancient poets.

07:29.749 --> 07:32.718
Fortunately for me,
no poet has ever sung

07:32.785 --> 07:34.047
about your clan.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.212
l'm the first.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.380
My clan?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.084
The Eternals on Voyager.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.719
''Shining Voyager,
far from home.''

07:42.795 --> 07:44.729
How do you know about that?

07:51.003 --> 07:55.030
Delta Flyer Log,
Stardate 53918.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.130
Harry and l are continuing

07:56.242 --> 07:57.368
toward the fourth planet.

07:57.443 --> 07:59.673
Sensors have picked up
natural dilithium deposits

07:59.745 --> 08:00.871
on nearly every land mass.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.845
Acknowledged.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.542
Has your warp core been damaged?

08:04.617 --> 08:06.710
Yes. We're running on thrusters.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.118
Can you track our position?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.816
How long have l been here?

08:13.226 --> 08:14.625
Eight days.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.357
l was walking through
these mountains.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.490
l saw a light
burn across the sky,

08:20.566 --> 08:23.160
and l heard a terrible sound.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.499
When l arrived, l found you.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.402
l treated your wounds.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.407
And you tied me to this chair.

08:29.475 --> 08:32.467
When a gift falls
from the heavens,

08:32.544 --> 08:35.173
only a fool would let her go.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.217
You've already given me
one play.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.878
The story told by those voices.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.613
l pieced them together,

08:43.688 --> 08:45.520
tried to fill in the gaps.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.889
You made a play out of our logs?

08:47.960 --> 08:52.226
The Away Mission
of B'Elanna Torres.

08:52.298 --> 08:54.289
My patron was impressed.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.268
Well, he has great taste.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.861
Now, take that knife
of yours and cut me free.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.602
That... would be unwise.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.168
Why?

09:07.246 --> 09:10.306
My patron is intrigued
by the Voyager Eternals.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.816
He wants another play.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.409
To compose that, l need more...

09:14.487 --> 09:15.749
details.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.948
And you expect
to get them from me?

09:18.024 --> 09:20.584
l did save your life.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.728
l need to get back to Voyager.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.669
l need another play.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.039
What exactly
do you want to know?

09:35.107 --> 09:35.801
Everything.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.365
lt's not possible.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.706
We ''Eternals'' have our rules.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.748
We can't just...
give everything away.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.247
How did you get lost?

09:47.320 --> 09:50.289
Cut me free and l'll tell you.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.887
You won't leave me?

09:55.962 --> 09:57.259
Cut me free.

10:14.013 --> 10:17.312
You're the one who's leaving.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.745
Don't come back.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.699
Computer, bring the subspace
transmitter on line.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.962
Unable to comply.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.162
Why not?

10:39.271 --> 10:40.704
lnsufficient power.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.884
Great. Now there's no power.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.886
Are you hungry?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.922
l told you not to come back.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.519
You haven't eaten in days.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.859
We have to support each other,
we poets.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.927
l'm an Engineer.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.230
l fix things.

11:15.441 --> 11:18.433
From the looks of it,
you're not doing so well.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.239
Are you a poet or a critic?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.847
Tell me about Earth.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.944
l have to sing
for my supper, huh?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.318
We all do...

11:31.691 --> 11:33.318
...in one way or another.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.190
Earth.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.570
lt's, uh...

11:48.641 --> 11:52.008
an island...

11:52.144 --> 11:55.307
a beautiful island,
blue and green.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.609
And Voyager?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.240
A- a great ship?

11:58.317 --> 12:00.683
ln a long line of great ships.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.880
How did Voyager get lost?

12:02.988 --> 12:05.286
The Caretaker.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.120
An Eternal.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.894
Yes, you could say that.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.897
He...

12:12.965 --> 12:16.264
caused a storm,
which blew us off course.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.098
Tom Paris.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.943
Are you in love with him?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.772
Supper is over.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.511
Come with me.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.839
This is where we put
all the names and dates

13:02.915 --> 13:05.179
when our heads
won't hold anymore.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.684
A memory.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.219
Exactly.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.413
Tell me...

13:09.488 --> 13:11.319
have you ever seen this before?

13:15.194 --> 13:16.821
Winter's tears.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.193
Can you get me some?

13:20.266 --> 13:23.895
This is... dilithium,
isn't it?

13:24.003 --> 13:25.698
What you were looking for.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.102
Where can l find it?

13:27.173 --> 13:28.936
The only deposit l know of is

13:29.074 --> 13:31.406
on the hunting grounds
of my patron.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.206
He'd execute me for trespassing,

13:33.279 --> 13:36.043
and you, well, he'd love
to capture an Eternal.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.846
M- maybe l'm more powerful
than he is.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.353
Perhaps, but, if he caught you,

13:42.421 --> 13:45.618
he'd force you to fight
against his enemies.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.886
They're constantly
at each other's throats,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.393
bickering over territory,

13:49.461 --> 13:51.759
raiding each other's land,
starting wars

13:51.831 --> 13:54.823
whenever they can be
guaranteed of good weather

13:54.900 --> 13:56.891
and we suffer the consequences.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.562
You don't want
to get involved with them.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.038
Which is why you're going
to get the dilithium.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.541
l told you,
l'd be executed if l'm caught.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.374
The dilithium...

14:06.445 --> 14:09.039
or l don't say
another word about...

14:09.114 --> 14:12.083
''shining Voyager,
far from home.''

14:15.421 --> 14:16.786
Did you...?

14:20.492 --> 14:23.188
Don't get caught.

14:38.644 --> 14:39.941
Well?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.116
Beautiful.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.289
l've got an idea
for your next play.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.864
l've been visited
by inspiration herself.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.796
How does this sound?

15:00.866 --> 15:04.962
The Rescue of B'Elanna Torres- - 
right here, in one week.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.002
One week?!

15:06.071 --> 15:07.470
Let's get to work.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.473
Dismissed.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.140
That's it?

15:18.217 --> 15:19.206
Mr. Paris, try to stay calm.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.877
No, that's not going to happen.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.647
lsn't there
anything else we can do?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.552
Not until something
shows up on sensors.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.056
l'll take a shuttle out myself.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.218
l'll run
a planet- by- planet search.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.761
An inefficient plan.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.455
And too dangerous.
You could

15:31.530 --> 15:34.397
be hit by the same spatial
eddies that sent the Flyer

15:34.466 --> 15:35.398
off course.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.866
We need to concentrate

15:36.969 --> 15:38.561
our efforts from here, Tom.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.865
All right?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.238
Dismissed.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.780
Steady- armed Paris,

15:55.854 --> 15:58.948
bound by a sleep
that brings no rest...

15:59.091 --> 16:00.456
The door opens

16:00.559 --> 16:03.323
and the shadow of a woman
falls on the helmsman.

16:03.362 --> 16:07.059
His eyes open...

16:07.132 --> 16:11.432
Seven of Nine,
did you find B'Elanna Torres?

16:11.537 --> 16:14.005
l'm sorry to disappoint you.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.300
Closer.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.669
Closer.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.849
Unpleasant news,

16:28.921 --> 16:32.584
delivered by the most
pleasing of messengers.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.688
No, no, no, no.

16:37.763 --> 16:40.664
Seven of Nine is a Borg,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.462
- the scourge of the Eternals.
- l...

16:42.568 --> 16:43.796
You're portraying her

16:43.902 --> 16:45.529
like a shy bride
on her wedding night.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.229
Once more.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.374
Seven of Nine,

16:55.447 --> 16:57.938
did you find B'Elanna Torres?

16:58.083 --> 17:00.813
l am sorry to disappoint you.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.755
l can't blame my performers.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.954
These Eternals on Voyager
are difficult to understand.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.520
Will you stop walking around?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.224
You're going to break something.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.823
This Tuvok, for example.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.969
He's not like anybody
l've ever met.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.867
No emotions?
How's that possible?

17:20.005 --> 17:22.666
lt just is.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.344
lt worked?

17:26.412 --> 17:28.880
lt worked.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.353
Okay.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.729
Computer, bring subspace
transmitter on line.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.901
What happened?!

17:50.969 --> 17:52.402
l don't know.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.996
The transmitter must have
been weakened in the crash.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.735
lt couldn't take
the energy surge.

17:58.977 --> 17:59.944
These Vulcans...

18:00.012 --> 18:01.809
Enough!

18:07.519 --> 18:10.386
What kind of metallurgic
technology

18:10.456 --> 18:12.447
do you people have?

18:12.524 --> 18:14.424
Alloys...
which ones can you make?

18:14.493 --> 18:15.755
Steel? Bronze?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.295
Bronze.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.954
Bronze, all right.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.398
l need a plate of metal
this big, as thin as it can be- -

18:22.501 --> 18:24.196
three parts tin
to five parts bronze,

18:24.303 --> 18:25.827
one side coated with gold.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.064
Gold is expensive;
l can't afford it.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.470
Then you're going into debt.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.771
Then tell me about the Vulcans.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.573
Get me the plate,
and then l'll tell you.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.670
Everyone's asleep.
l'll do it in the morning.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.945
The Vulcans?

18:47.092 --> 18:49.856
Maybe l've miscounted, but...

18:49.928 --> 18:53.022
l don't think you've slept
in ten days?

18:53.098 --> 18:55.430
Your count is accurate.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.603
Don't you think
you should go to bed?

19:00.672 --> 19:03.971
As a Vulcan,
l can function without sleep

19:04.042 --> 19:06.272
for more than two weeks.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.973
But there's a point
of diminishing returns

19:09.047 --> 19:11.948
when your mind starts
to play tricks on you.

19:12.017 --> 19:17.114
My mind, Mr. Neelix,
does not play tricks.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.586
The ship is lonely
without them, isn't it?

19:23.662 --> 19:29.294
lf you would allow me
to continue my sensor analysis,

19:29.401 --> 19:32.097
l might be able to locate them.

19:34.072 --> 19:37.132
lf there's anything else
you need...

19:37.242 --> 19:40.040
a stronger tea, perhaps.

19:46.618 --> 19:50.520
When a friend is lost,
the mind is split in half,

19:50.589 --> 19:52.523
divided between memory
of the past

19:52.591 --> 19:55.082
and fear of the future.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.856
Harry Kim, Ensign.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.898
Only a boy when fate took you

19:59.998 --> 20:02.432
from the arms
of blue- green Earth.

20:02.534 --> 20:07.403
B'Elanna Torres,
half- Klingon, half- human.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.303
l am honored to call you...

20:09.374 --> 20:11.535
What are you doing?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.407
ls that a tear?

20:13.478 --> 20:15.105
Yes.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.273
Logical Tuvok doesn't cry.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.943
That's why they call him
logical.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.451
Everybody cries.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.953
The land of Vulcan

20:23.021 --> 20:25.421
has no laughter,
and it has no tears.

20:25.490 --> 20:28.584
lt is a very quiet place- - 
calm, just like Tuvok.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.958
l can't believe that.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.963
You don't have to;
just don't cry.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.090
The audience
won't believe it either.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.668
They'll either think Tuvok
is an unfeeling monster

20:37.736 --> 20:39.397
or that l am a bad performer.

20:39.504 --> 20:42.132
They'll realize that beneath
your unfeeling exterior

20:42.241 --> 20:44.300
is a heart
that's breaking, silently

20:44.409 --> 20:47.276
and in more pain than any of us
can possibly understand,

20:47.346 --> 20:49.780
because that's what it is
to be Vulcan.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.180
Try it again.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.848
Kelis!

21:00.058 --> 21:01.753
What's wrong?

21:01.793 --> 21:05.320
Our patron has been insulted
by his enemy to the north.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.229
The armories are opened.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.024
Has a battlefield been chosen?

21:09.134 --> 21:10.897
Not yet.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.402
Then we have a chance.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.243
l need your help.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.116
l've given you enough help.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.121
Where's that piece of metal?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.096
Not bad.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.791
My patron's been angered

21:40.866 --> 21:42.959
by the leader
of a neighboring state.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.626
He'll want to take revenge.

21:44.736 --> 21:46.169
lt could lead to war.

21:46.271 --> 21:50.173
We Eternals aren't supposed
to take sides.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.335
l'm not asking you to fight.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.845
l need a way to change his mind.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.609
l don't have
that kind of magical power.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.014
Yes, you do.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.587
l believe
the right kind of play

22:02.688 --> 22:05.418
can turn the mind
from violent thoughts.

22:05.457 --> 22:08.153
The perfect play
might even stop a war.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.357
l can't fix the transmitter
with this.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.697
lt has too many impurities.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.270
lt'll never carry
a plasma charge.

22:19.338 --> 22:23.069
lf the fighting starts,
scouting parties will start

22:23.141 --> 22:25.735
moving through these mountains.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.938
You'll be discovered.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.503
But my play...

22:29.581 --> 22:32.448
it could stop it from happening.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.746
You have to help me.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.414
There's nothing l can do.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.787
Then come with me.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.258
l'll show you
what l've done so far.

22:44.463 --> 22:47.227
lt's our only chance.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.563
She's a fellow poet
from across the eastern sea,

22:52.671 --> 22:54.639
an expert
on the Voyager Eternals.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.004
She's devoted her life to them.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.610
She's here to help.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.756
The Rescue of B'Elanna Torres.

23:11.823 --> 23:14.291
We begin with Harry Kim,

23:14.359 --> 23:16.759
reaching Voyager
in the escape pod.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.796
He tells Captain Janeway

23:18.864 --> 23:21.389
that B'Elanna Torres is lost.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.900
We continue to the point
where they discover

23:24.035 --> 23:26.333
a piece of the Delta Flyer.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.406
After that...

23:30.742 --> 23:31.936
lt's simple.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.544
They search for B'Elanna Torres.

23:33.645 --> 23:34.907
B'Elanna Torres is found...

23:34.980 --> 23:37.676
- Or not found.
- Or not found.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.773
The end.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.818
Sounds pretty
straightforward to me.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.683
That's exactly the problem.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.551
Where is the mistaken identity?

23:44.623 --> 23:46.716
The discovery?
The sudden reversal?

23:48.727 --> 23:53.562
Mistaken identity- - 
a character who is someone else.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.065
Discovery- -

23:55.133 --> 23:57.465
the moment when that identity
is revealed.

23:57.569 --> 24:01.096
Reversal- - a situation
that turns from good to bad

24:01.206 --> 24:02.673
in a blink of an eye.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.641
Find the truth of your story,

24:05.710 --> 24:09.077
and you won't need
all those tricks.

24:09.147 --> 24:13.311
l don't know how things are done
across the Eastern Sea,

24:13.385 --> 24:17.651
but here,
poets have become lazy.

24:17.722 --> 24:23.126
They rely on manipulation
to move their audience.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.823
lt wasn't always that way.

24:25.897 --> 24:28.195
Welcome.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.733
Thank you.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.196
The truth of my story.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.571
lt's an old- fashioned idea.

24:37.642 --> 24:41.476
Today audiences want
excitement... passion.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.910
Let me show you what l've done

24:44.983 --> 24:47.679
with Captain Janeway
and Commander Chakotay.

24:49.354 --> 24:52.448
Let's make a good impression
on our visitor.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.258
Chakotay, why must l be denied

24:58.330 --> 25:02.426
what every other female officer
on this ship can have?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.991
Captain?

25:04.102 --> 25:06.502
The privilege...

25:06.571 --> 25:08.664
of your touch.

25:25.624 --> 25:26.784
Come in.

25:30.061 --> 25:33.224
lf that was good news,
you'd be smiling.

25:33.298 --> 25:36.426
l was just contacted
by an alien transport vessel.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.301
They picked up
the Delta Flyer's distress call.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.370
The primary controls
are off- line.

25:46.444 --> 25:49.106
l've ordered Harry to eject.
l still have thrusters.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.375
l'm setting a course
for an L- Class planet.

25:51.449 --> 25:52.939
l'll try to maintain contact.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.416
They couldn't get a fix
on her position.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.455
That was ten days ago.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.290
B'Elanna ordered Harry
into an escape pod.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.258
What's the longest
he could survive?

26:04.896 --> 26:06.295
Less than ten days.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.623
An L- Class planet.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.464
l've already narrowed
the search parameters.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.233
lf B'Elanna made it there,
it's possible Harry did, too.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.273
Good night, Commander.

26:24.349 --> 26:25.782
Captain.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.220
We'll have a final rehearsal
in the morning.

26:42.834 --> 26:46.292
The last Tuvok scene
doesn't make sense to me,

26:46.404 --> 26:48.895
and we still don't
have an ending.

26:49.074 --> 26:51.838
l've got the rest of
the night to work on it.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.378
Maybe you can get some sleep.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.924
What did you think?

27:06.992 --> 27:10.985
Captain Janeway kissing
Commander Chakotay?

27:11.062 --> 27:13.963
Tom Paris kissing Seven of Nine?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.296
l don't see the point.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.869
Anger is like fire.

27:18.970 --> 27:23.100
Love can be the rain
that extinguishes it.

27:23.174 --> 27:26.507
My patron is filled
with hatred for his rival.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.411
So our play should be
filled with love.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.041
You can't change
somebody's way of life

27:32.117 --> 27:34.085
with a few lines of dialogue.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.676
Yes, you can.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.483
lt's been done before.

27:37.555 --> 27:40.820
Do you know
what this place used to be...

27:40.892 --> 27:42.154
a hundred years ago?

27:42.227 --> 27:43.489
A temple.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.893
And this was the altar stone.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.558
Every year a victim
would be sacrificed on it

27:48.633 --> 27:49.861
in honor of winter,

27:49.968 --> 27:52.198
and then one year- -

27:52.303 --> 27:55.238
nobody remembers
exactly when or why- -

27:55.306 --> 27:57.831
a play took the place
of the ritual,

27:57.942 --> 28:00.342
and no one had to die
here again.

28:02.280 --> 28:06.307
Why can't my play
take the place of a war?

28:06.384 --> 28:09.820
Well, you're going to have to do
a lot better than Harry Kim

28:09.954 --> 28:11.353
kissing the Delaney sisters.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.390
Why?

28:12.457 --> 28:15.255
Because...

28:15.326 --> 28:18.625
when you think that you are
surrounded by enemies,

28:18.697 --> 28:21.962
when you're up against the Borg,
or... or Species 8472,

28:22.033 --> 28:26.561
the last thing on your mind
is romance.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.639
You're an Eternal.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.532
You have to help me.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.808
l'm sorry, Kelis.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.942
The Borg...

28:42.954 --> 28:45.081
tell me more about them.

28:48.093 --> 28:53.861
They are soldiers,
part of a vast army.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.400
They all think the same thoughts

28:56.501 --> 29:01.370
and they travel on ships
that look like hives.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.304
Like insect colonies.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.103
They even have a queen.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.505
That sounds terrifying.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.948
Captain Janeway hasn't been able
to destroy them.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.781
She is a Starfleet officer,

29:15.854 --> 29:18.448
trained to avoid violence
whenever possible.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.253
She would make peace
with the Borg, if she could.

29:21.392 --> 29:25.590
This is what l need...

29:25.663 --> 29:26.823
an enemy,

29:26.898 --> 29:29.628
someone to stand in the way

29:29.734 --> 29:32.134
of Voyager
finding B'Elanna Torres. lt...

29:33.638 --> 29:36.038
Captain Janeway,
driven by vengeance

29:36.107 --> 29:38.234
must seek out
the Queen of the Borg.

29:38.309 --> 29:43.178
The audience thinks she plans
to destroy them all, but...

29:43.248 --> 29:45.113
Go on.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.980
The sudden reversal!

29:47.051 --> 29:49.986
Eh, Captain Janeway, holding
her spear at the queen's throat,

29:50.054 --> 29:51.282
throws her weapon aside,

29:51.356 --> 29:54.291
and she argues passionately

29:54.359 --> 29:56.520
to put an end
to their conflict...

29:56.594 --> 29:58.186
in words...

29:59.931 --> 30:02.456
...no one will fail
to understand.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.798
lncluding your patron?

30:10.308 --> 30:12.742
That's much better
than all that kissing.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.754
Stay and help me.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.449
l still need an ending.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.923
You'll figure something out.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.689
B'Elanna Torres dies tragically.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.591
You wouldn't dare.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.216
l followed you here
expecting to find a love nest.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.798
lt's quite a nest.

31:10.902 --> 31:13.564
You're no poet
from across the sea.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.229
You're an Eternal.

31:16.908 --> 31:19.376
Maybe even B'Elanna Torres
herself.

31:19.477 --> 31:22.139
Don't be ridiculous.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.307
Mm.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.749
You know
all he thinks about is you?

31:29.354 --> 31:31.117
We're collaborators,

31:31.189 --> 31:32.451
that's all.

31:32.523 --> 31:35.083
lf you come to the performance
tomorrow night,

31:35.159 --> 31:38.060
l'll expose you to the Autarch.

31:38.129 --> 31:40.620
Just leave us alone.

31:40.698 --> 31:43.599
You fix your ship and go.

31:43.701 --> 31:44.668
Please.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.171
Friend of yours?

31:54.979 --> 31:56.173
Harry?

31:59.350 --> 32:00.408
Give me a hand.

32:00.518 --> 32:01.883
Here.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.785
Oh, how?

32:03.855 --> 32:06.153
l ran into some turbulence
in the escape pod,

32:06.224 --> 32:08.852
decided to turn around
and follow your ion trail,

32:08.927 --> 32:11.452
landed about 200 kilometers
from here.

32:11.529 --> 32:12.461
You walked?

32:12.530 --> 32:13.519
At night.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.259
l tracked your position
with a tricorder

32:15.333 --> 32:17.164
and tried to stay hidden
during the day.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.472
Uh, l've got
some emergency rations left,

32:21.572 --> 32:22.698
a phaser,

32:22.807 --> 32:24.570
and the escape pod's
transmitter,

32:24.642 --> 32:26.701
which l didn't have enough
power left to run, but...

32:26.778 --> 32:29.212
Harry Kim saves the day.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.641
Just the ending
l was looking for.

32:32.717 --> 32:35.345
Huh?

32:46.264 --> 32:47.322
The final moment.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.798
The last scene.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.859
More important than anything
that's gone before.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.572
But what is it?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.251
Where is she?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.811
Your collaborator's probably

33:11.889 --> 33:13.857
halfway across
the Eastern Sea by now.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.450
She'll be here.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.985
You said we'd have an ending
by mid- morning.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.498
We won't have time to learn it.

33:22.567 --> 33:23.898
lt'll come to me.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.297
Don't worry.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.276
Want to give it a try?

33:38.349 --> 33:40.943
Why not?

33:41.052 --> 33:43.612
The 38th time
might be the charm.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.463
lt's working!

33:53.531 --> 33:55.726
The subspace transmitter
is on line.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.625
Why don't you do the honors?

33:58.736 --> 34:01.364
Voyager...

34:01.472 --> 34:03.531
this is the Delta Flyer.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.909
Our patron has arrived.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.150
He's not in a very good mood.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.879
He will be.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.784
Not if this is any indication.

34:17.855 --> 34:20.289
Yes. Kelis, this is
no way to end a play.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.949
lt doesn't make sense.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.155
lt'll have to.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.925
Go, go.

34:37.675 --> 34:41.543
Who are the enemies of Voyager?

34:41.612 --> 34:42.873
The Borg...

34:42.947 --> 34:44.880
Species 8472...

34:44.949 --> 34:47.509
You know where the ridge ends
just below the peak?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.610
Run there as fast as you can.

34:49.687 --> 34:53.145
You'll find a vessel
wrecked against the rocks.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.954
Go inside and give this
to our friend.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.358
Don't be frightened.

34:57.428 --> 34:58.554
Go.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.644
Tuvok.

35:28.593 --> 35:29.651
Tuvok.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.627
As you were.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.573
Bridge to Chakotay.

35:42.673 --> 35:44.231
Go ahead.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.776
Request permission
to be relieved.

35:46.844 --> 35:49.574
Understood.
l'll be right there.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.519
We're picking up
a subspace transmission- -

35:57.588 --> 35:58.953
Starfleet frequency.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.751
lt's a little rough.
Hang on.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.461
...Delta Flyer.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.021
Harry and l are all right.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.260
We're on an L- Class planet.

36:10.368 --> 36:12.268
Propulsion is down...

36:14.272 --> 36:15.830
Origin?

36:16.007 --> 36:17.474
5.2 light- years.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.032
F- type star.

36:19.143 --> 36:20.542
Looks like the fourth planet.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.636
Lay in a course...

36:22.713 --> 36:24.374
maximum warp.

36:24.448 --> 36:25.972
Seven of Nine.

36:26.050 --> 36:26.982
Captain.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.383
The Delta Flyer
has been found...

36:29.453 --> 36:32.445
in pieces on a rocky shore.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.013
And B'Elanna Torres?

36:34.091 --> 36:36.525
No sign of her.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.892
Seven of Nine, you are
my eyes and my ears.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.260
lf anyone can find her,
it is you.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.464
Her eyes and her ears...

36:47.572 --> 36:50.439
and the viper in her nest.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.373
l, Seven of Nine,
have no intention

36:52.443 --> 36:54.741
of finding B'Elanna Torres.

36:54.812 --> 36:58.646
l, Seven of Nine,
am Queen of the Borg.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.910
Surprised?

36:59.984 --> 37:01.417
No one will be more surprised

37:01.519 --> 37:05.580
than Janeway when l take
my revenge on Voyager.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.817
Say nothing

37:06.924 --> 37:10.223
or you, too,
will be assimilated.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.989
Captain...

37:15.066 --> 37:16.431
l will comply.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.535
My enemies are everywhere...

37:23.608 --> 37:26.873
without and within.

37:26.944 --> 37:30.641
Seven of Nine is
Queen of the Borg.

37:30.715 --> 37:33.582
Surprised?

37:33.651 --> 37:35.881
So was l.

37:35.987 --> 37:41.755
Tell her nothing,
or l will lose my advantage...

37:41.826 --> 37:45.318
and my ship as well.

37:45.396 --> 37:46.886
Are you okay?

37:46.998 --> 37:47.896
Yes.

37:47.999 --> 37:48.897
We're fine.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.365
Good to hear it.

37:50.468 --> 37:51.935
We'll see you soon.

38:04.515 --> 38:05.743
Don't be afraid.

38:25.269 --> 38:26.236
What is it?

38:29.974 --> 38:32.442
''Without inspiration...

38:32.543 --> 38:34.909
B'Elanna Torres will perish.''

38:36.514 --> 38:38.379
He's threatening
to kill off B'Elanna.

38:39.550 --> 38:42.280
As the climax to his play.

38:42.353 --> 38:43.650
Let him.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.518
That means...

38:45.589 --> 38:47.716
that he still can't
figure out the ending.

38:47.792 --> 38:48.986
Uh, who cares?!

38:49.060 --> 38:51.051
l do.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.425
You're serious.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.660
Harry...

38:57.134 --> 38:59.102
...have you ever
inspired anybody?

38:59.203 --> 39:01.296
That's kind
of a strange question.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.930
Well, it's been
a strange couple of weeks.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.508
He needs me, or he's the one

39:05.609 --> 39:07.270
who's going to die
on that stage.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.279
What are you talking about?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.747
The transporter is on line.

39:11.816 --> 39:13.443
Tell the Captain
l'll be a little late.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.814
B'Elanna...?

39:14.952 --> 39:17.318
Wait for my signal.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.660
My death is irrelevant.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.824
You will never see
the gleaming cities of Earth.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.833
You will be assimilated.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.868
And if l let you live?

39:33.003 --> 39:35.233
Also irrelevant.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.139
You don't believe that.

39:41.145 --> 39:42.806
The battle is over.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.178
Go home.

39:45.249 --> 39:47.149
How foolish of you
to let me go...

39:47.218 --> 39:48.651
free to attack you again.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.313
And again and again,

39:51.389 --> 39:54.324
until all your drones and
all my crew are destroyed- -

39:54.392 --> 39:56.292
until everything
we value is gone

39:56.360 --> 39:59.295
and there is nothing left...

39:59.363 --> 40:01.092
but our hatred.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.365
This final scene
will ruin everything

40:05.469 --> 40:06.697
that we've done out there.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.237
We'll have to improvise.

40:08.305 --> 40:09.237
lt's too late.

40:09.306 --> 40:10.432
No, it's not.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.099
l knew you'd come.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.471
And l told you not to.

40:13.544 --> 40:14.511
Wait!

40:16.680 --> 40:17.908
Let's go.

40:19.717 --> 40:25.383
Finally, Voyager
has reached our shores.

40:25.456 --> 40:28.220
And not a moment too soon.

40:28.292 --> 40:30.852
Kelis the Poet must say good- bye

40:30.928 --> 40:35.831
as B'Elanna Torres returns
to the Eternals

40:35.900 --> 40:38.164
in a dazzling blaze of light.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.364
On a faraway,
snow- covered peak...

40:42.473 --> 40:43.565
No!

40:43.674 --> 40:46.006
Right here, before your eyes.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.442
Wait. She's not
from across the Eastern Sea.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.241
She's an Eternal.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.179
l'm telling you
she's B'Elanna Torres.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.716
The real B'Elanna Torres!

40:53.784 --> 40:55.183
l saw her ship!

40:56.787 --> 41:02.521
The lead actress,
in a fit of jealousy

41:02.593 --> 41:04.857
brands her rival an Eternal.

41:04.929 --> 41:08.797
Our patron rises to his feet
to stop the play.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.541
Nicely done.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.710
l almost believed you.

41:26.851 --> 41:27.875
Continue.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.654
Stay.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.093
Voyager needs me.

41:41.265 --> 41:42.892
So do l.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.457
No, you don't.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.705
You have all that you need
right here.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.313
l'll be inspired...

41:59.950 --> 42:02.680
...every time l think of you.

42:04.555 --> 42:05.852
One to beam...

42:08.092 --> 42:10.253
...to ascend...

42:10.327 --> 42:12.795
to the heavens.

42:19.637 --> 42:21.104
And so ends

42:21.171 --> 42:23.036
The Rescue of B'Elanna Torres,

42:23.107 --> 42:26.543
half- Klingon, B'Elanna Torres,
half- human,

42:26.610 --> 42:30.603
B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer.

42:30.681 --> 42:34.276
These stories will continue...

42:34.351 --> 42:36.876
for as long as we have
the breath to tell them...

42:38.656 --> 42:41.557
...and as long as our patrons...

42:41.625 --> 42:43.115
remain wise

42:43.193 --> 42:45.559
and compassionate.

42:45.629 --> 42:47.529
And Voyager
will continue on her journey

42:47.598 --> 42:50.692
to the gleaming cities
of Earth...

42:50.801 --> 42:52.792
where peace reigns...

42:52.903 --> 42:55.872
and hatred has no home.
