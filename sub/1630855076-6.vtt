WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.878
-JEFF: Hey, Sam.
-What's up?

00:04.171 --> 00:05.797
This.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.133
Ugh. What is that?
Is that Nathaniel?

00:08.133 --> 00:10.219
JEFF:
Yeah, he keeps emailing me
from his retreat.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.678
It actually sounds really fun.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.555
Do you think
I could get diagnosed

00:13.555 --> 00:15.641
with toxic masculinity?

00:15.641 --> 00:17.518
No.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.810
And, dude, we can't lose you.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.479
It's been mayhem
since Nathaniel left.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.564
(notification chime)

00:22.564 --> 00:24.691
Oh, corporate just sent out
this week's assignments.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.444
Ugh. I got
the Renaissance Faire.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.695
Great, I got to spend
the whole day

00:28.695 --> 00:30.155
with a blacksmith
with a theater degree.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.907
-What'd you get?
-Holy shit.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.659
The Greater Boston
Film Festival.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.452
-Wait, what? Why?
-I don't know.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.080
It says I'm interviewing Bob
the Drag Queen from Drag Race.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.207
I guess she has like a new
documentary she's promoting.

00:40.207 --> 00:43.335
I could get a byline
on a big article.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.878
Honestly, that sounds
like a lot of work.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.463
And you look kind of tired.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.215
My dark circles
are hereditary, Jeff.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.384
I'm just saying the Ren Faire
is so much easier.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.804
It's corsets, jousting, turkey
legs. You're in, you're out.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.973
And everyone's home
by, like, 6:00 p. m.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.474
because they all still live
with their parents.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.558
Yeah, that sounds really fun,

00:58.558 --> 00:59.893
but I think I'll
stick with mine.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.478
You know, this could be
good for me, actually.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.983
JIM:
But here's the thing,

01:05.983 --> 01:07.901
it's not about others' actions,
right?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.528
We can't control
other people, right?

01:09.528 --> 01:11.071
-It-It-It's not
about their actions.
-(groaning)

01:11.071 --> 01:14.616
It's about your reaction.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.785
Um, for instance, if I said,

01:16.785 --> 01:20.914
"Carol, although you might think
that your judgment is silent,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.041
the eye roll you just gave me
could be seen from space,"

01:23.041 --> 01:24.126
you would say...?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.127
Eh.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.503
Not taking the bait?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.130
Very good,
great illustration, Carol.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.339
(clears throat)

01:29.339 --> 01:30.465
Can you hear me?

01:30.465 --> 01:32.634
Yeah. Control is a lie. Got it.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.721
Okay, um, seriously, though,
do-do you want to move up?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.681
Because it's
a smaller group today.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.433
-And, um...
-There's a spot open next to me.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.852
(Carol sighs)

01:41.852 --> 01:44.062
JIM:
Great. Um, you know what?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.690
I should actually mention
I-I'm teasing a little bit,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.108
and it's because Carol and I
kind of do know each other...

01:48.108 --> 01:49.484
Excuse me, I prefer
an aisle seat.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.861
...and this is
her first meeting.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.654
Actually, you know what, Carol?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.740
-Thank you.
-It's time for newcomers share.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.033
Would-would you like to come up?

01:57.534 --> 01:58.910
God, no.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.454
Okay, well, Carol, thank you

02:00.454 --> 02:02.622
for sharing why
you are not sharing.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.876
Oh-ho-ho, yes, swag bag.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.004
Aw, lemon banana crunch?
It's like their worst flavor.

02:09.004 --> 02:11.131
Did anyone get blueberry oat?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.924
It's my favorite,
I'll trade you.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.259
Sammy?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.886
Sam.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.179
-Sam, you okay?
-Huh? What's up?

02:17.179 --> 02:18.680
You got that
thinking emoji face on.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.890
What's going on? You okay?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.516
Yeah, no, sorry, I just
want to make sure

02:21.516 --> 02:23.393
these questions are
good, that's all.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.271
Are you sure you want us
to be here?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.981
Because I know I get
kind of stressed

02:27.981 --> 02:29.816
when I combine work and fun,

02:29.816 --> 02:31.485
like when I did
the happy hour haircuts

02:31.485 --> 02:33.612
and everybody kept
dancing in the chair.

02:33.612 --> 02:34.696
So many Band-Aids.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.822
No, no, I'm happy
you guys are here.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.990
-BRIT: You sure?
-I mean, it was free

02:36.990 --> 02:38.408
and you get to
meet Alex, finally.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.785
I think it'll be really fun.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.161
It's gonna be fun.
Everything's gonna be great.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.497
You know, we can meet Alex
when you're not working.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.415
We can go to that
Korean-Italian fusion spot.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.000
-Ew.
-What's going on, pals?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.085
-"Pals"?
-Hey.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.212
Yeah, pals. I didn't want
to say "ladies."

02:50.212 --> 02:51.588
I don't want your friends
to think I'm hitting on them.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.298
-Oh, no, God forbid.
-Yeah.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.051
This is, um, Felicia and Brit.
This is Alex.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.678
It is such a pleasure
to meet you two.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.970
I've heard so much about you.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.722
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.474
-(phone buzzes)
-Oh.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.184
One second.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.977
My boy Big Rog is hitting me up.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.438
-We came up together
at The Observer.
-Right.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.732
He has some media dudes
he wants me to meet.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.484
Ooh, local film scene
your thing?

03:12.484 --> 03:15.153
Uh, yeah, I actually used
to cover this event

03:15.153 --> 03:16.988
and then I got fired, so...

03:16.988 --> 03:18.448
I'm just arm candy this year.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.411
Here he is. Give me one sec.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.578
Yo, Rog, where you at, dude?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.664
I don't see you nowhere.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.332
Nah, I'm just hanging out
with my girl.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.000
I'll be there in a sec. Bye.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.877
-Um, is it cool
if I pop over there?
-Yeah, of course.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.003
-You're the best. Mwah.
-Okay.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.004
I'll see you guys in 15?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.882
-Oh.
-FELICIA: Oh.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.137
SAMANTHA:
What do you guys think?

03:41.388 --> 03:44.766
-Oh...
-He-he seems like...

03:44.766 --> 03:46.560
-a busy guy,
he's working the room.
-Mm-hmm.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.978
-We like that.
-Yeah.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.313
Do you think he'll mind
if I just take a look?

03:50.313 --> 03:53.024
Because, um, if
I can get extra pens,

03:53.024 --> 03:55.235
-Zack loves promotional pens.
-SAMANTHA: I don't
think he'll care.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.447
FELICIA:
Ooh, tequila.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.240
BARISTA:
Venti oat milk caramel

04:00.240 --> 04:01.992
half-sweet cappuccino

04:01.992 --> 04:04.411
with four shots
of espresso, for Mindy.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.624
Oh. Mindy. Hey.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.959
James.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.673
Um, four shots of espresso,
that's a lot.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.341
Well, it's a gamer holiday.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.968
The new Ren's Legion
is dropping,

04:19.968 --> 04:22.721
and I want to stay up all night
and stab wraiths in the eye.

04:22.721 --> 04:26.141
Oh, yeah, right, I'm-I'm
actually picking up Ren's, also.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.934
So...

04:27.934 --> 04:30.020
if you're going to Pixel Palace,
maybe save me a spot in line?

04:30.020 --> 04:33.899
It's not 2008, James.
I'm downloading it.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.320
Well, uh, see you around,
I guess.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.738
(door closes)

04:41.406 --> 04:43.575
And then I told him, "Look..."

04:45.577 --> 04:47.370
It's been like half an hour.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.039
What do you think
he's doing over there?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.500
Ooh. Fading Farmland: A Real
Look at America's Middle.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.460
And... the last showing
is in five minutes.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.545
You can't actually
want to see that.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.923
Yes, I can.
We're at a film festival.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.884
Go ahead. I-I'll meet up
with you after the interview.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.761
Yeah? Okay, great.
You're-you're gonna kill it.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.095
You know, I got to go, too.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.847
Zack's got plans
and Trent's stuck at work.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.642
No. Hey, you can't
leave me, too. I mean...

05:08.642 --> 05:10.894
you haven't even gotten to
hang out with Alex yet, so...

05:10.894 --> 05:14.189
Yeah, I'd say it's more like he
didn't get to hang out with us.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.273
But it's okay.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.526
Calm down.
You're gonna be great.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.652
-Okay?
-Okay.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.362
Break all the legs.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.781
I'm just gonna, um...

05:22.781 --> 05:24.115
just see if they have
more swag bags real quick.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.659
Love you.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.453
(sighs)

05:31.081 --> 05:32.541
Sorry.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.376
So I said to him,
"If you're not gonna wear pants,

05:34.376 --> 05:35.544
I'm not gonna wear pants."

05:35.544 --> 05:36.795
and then the interview
went amazing.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.964
He trusted me, it worked out.
It was great.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.799
Hey, there she is.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.593
This is my girlfriend Sam,
the working lady.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.220
She's actually gonna have
to pay for my scooter

05:45.220 --> 05:47.013
to get home tonight, you know?
(laughs)

05:47.013 --> 05:49.850
(laughs) Uh, Alex has told us
so much about you.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.394
Oh, really? What did he say?
Tell me everything.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.647
-I'll actually hang around
to hear the answer.
-(laughter)

05:55.647 --> 05:58.692
Can I interest anyone
in a signature cocktail?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.735
We have Boston Dirty Tea.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.862
Nah, we're good here, man.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.321
Not thirsty.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.364
BIG ROG:
Oh, um...

06:04.364 --> 06:05.615
Yeah, me neither.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.369
Actually, can we get
a round of waters?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.872
-Ooh, yeah.
-That'd be great.
-Awesome.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.833
I, um, I actually have
a lot of free drink tickets.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.626
If you guys want a round
of beers, I can go get you some.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.545
(awkward laughter)

06:18.545 --> 06:19.629
Um, that's really nice of you,
Sam, but no, thanks.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.589
We're good.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.886
ALEX:
Are you okay?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.012
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.182
-I'm gonna go...
-Shit, yeah, dude, yeah.
-That makes sense.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.314
Sam. Sam, are you okay?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
Hey, Sam, what's up?
Where's your friends?

06:38.857 --> 06:39.858
Uh, they left.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.193
Oh, I am so sorry.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.279
It... The guys, did you
tell them I was sober?

06:44.279 --> 06:46.406
No, that didn't come up.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.657
Really? 'Cause it seems like

06:47.657 --> 06:48.742
it's the only thing
they know about me.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.535
Why are you being so weird?

06:50.535 --> 06:53.246
It's midday and they didn't
want to get drunk at work.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.373
I think they didn't want to
drink in front of the alcoholic.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.584
Sam, not everything
is about you.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.918
JILL:
Sam? Sam Fink?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.296
Sam Fink?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.673
-Sam Fink?
-Yeah, hi.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.759
Oh, hi, I'm Bob
the Drag Queen's publicist.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.676
Can you come with me, please?

07:06.676 --> 07:07.969
Oh.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.054
Sam.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.347
Great. Bob's so wonderful.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.723
-You're just gonna crush it.
-ALEX: Sam.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.974
JILL: Of course,
I don't just represent Bob.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.976
-I represent a ton of other...
-(exhales)

07:14.976 --> 07:16.519
Bob's right through here.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.687
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.817
Hi, um, Sam Fink, Hit Pause.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.694
Oh, hi, Bob the Drag Queen,
from the film.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.987
Very nice to meet you.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.073
Nice to meet you, too.
Welcome, I'm so excited.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.991
Me, too. Where would you
like me to, um...?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.743
-You can sit right there.
-Oh, great. Okay, cool.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.702
Are you thirsty?
You want some water?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.412
It is-- it's very fancy.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.206
It is, um, filtered through
the porous rocks

07:36.206 --> 07:38.708
-of an active volcano.
-Whoa.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.877
I mean, I think it's just
a marketing tactic.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.712
-SAMANTHA: Yeah.
-But have some.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.172
Oh, no, uh, thank you,
I-I appreciate that, though.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.800
I'm not worthy of-of $40 water.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.636
-Okay.
-Um, let me see
what I have for you here.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.846
Okay, so...

07:51.846 --> 07:54.516
Uh, how did you first get
introduced to drag?

07:54.516 --> 07:55.767
Oh, I was recruited.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.269
Yeah, the gay agenda
is actually at work.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.646
I used to be
a straight white guy.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.856
So, no, I'm kidding.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.983
Honestly, I'm just, I'm just
a really interesting person.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.152
And I wanted more people
to pay attention, so...

08:06.152 --> 08:08.988
wigs, lashes, heels,
and the rest is history.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.323
Perfect.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.952
Uh, I... forgot to record.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.120
-I'm so sorry about this.
-No worries.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.413
I'm just gonna...

08:16.413 --> 08:18.623
set that... Nope, that's
not the right thing.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.541
-You got to use the right...
-And then we'll...

08:19.541 --> 08:20.917
Okay.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.168
-I'm sorry.
-No, leave it, just leave it.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.087
Baby, it is just volcano water.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.588
-(sighs)
-I have,

08:25.588 --> 08:27.424
I have another bottle,
it's okay, it's all right.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.466
-SAMANTHA: Okay, good.
-Are you all right, though?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.926
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.678
No, I just...

08:31.678 --> 08:33.555
My boyfriend and I just kind of
got into a little fight outside.

08:33.555 --> 08:34.848
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.765
I just feel a little frazzled.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.809
Sam. Listen.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.811
I love millennial drama.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.313
It is my favorite thing
in the world.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.398
So, if you want to be messy...

08:44.566 --> 08:46.609
...come be messy next to me.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.695
-Really?
-Yes.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.738
-Okay.
-I prefer it.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.780
I'll be quick, I promise.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.824
Oh, no. Please do not be quick.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.701
Okay. Um...

08:54.701 --> 08:56.286
Your-your boyfriend.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.579
-Alex.
-Alex.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.707
Eight. Nine.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.083
Do me a favor. Give me
a high five on the way up.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.169
-Oh!
-Oh, geez, okay.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.336
Oh, hey, hi, honey.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.463
How was the meeting?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.381
I... don't.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
Oh, okay. We're done,
we're done.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.885
Hey, Rick, you know what?
On-on second thought,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.678
let's-let's end it now, okay?

09:13.678 --> 09:15.305
All right? Don't want
to overextend.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.057
-No ego, amigo.
-Sounds good.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.933
All right,
I'll see next week, okay?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.518
Got you.
See you later, Terminator.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.895
Bye, Rick. Bye, Rick.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.438
(Rick laughs)

09:23.438 --> 09:24.481
Okay.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.774
So, uh...

09:25.774 --> 09:27.817
-how was it?
-It was ridiculous.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.028
It was everything
I thought it would be.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.947
We spent an hour
in really uncomfortable chairs,

09:32.947 --> 09:35.533
and they get excited
about asinine readings.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.744
And then they talk
and they talk and they talk.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.788
Isn't the point to talk?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.748
According to them, yeah.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.292
No, what-what I meant is,
I'm wondering if maybe

09:44.292 --> 09:46.211
part of the-the healing

09:46.211 --> 09:48.713
is to-to speak your-your-your
experience out loud.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.217
Why would I want to share
my business with those whiners?

09:52.217 --> 09:57.013
Well, because it's anonymous
and maybe a safe space to share.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.765
You know what else is anonymous?

09:58.765 --> 09:59.808
Glory holes.

09:59.808 --> 10:00.934
Are those a good idea?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.560
Whose side are you on?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.521
Well, I'm-I'm on your side.
Of course I'm on your side.

10:04.521 --> 10:08.233
C-Carol, you're-you're on my mat
with your-your shoes. That's...

10:08.233 --> 10:10.944
Carol, I've asked you many times
not to walk on my mat.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.863
It's my only space
and you're stomping all over it.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.532
Look, I get that you're annoyed,

10:15.532 --> 10:18.243
but what's the harm in maybe
going to a few more meetings?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.661
Listen, if you don't make
a real effort,

10:19.661 --> 10:23.665
you risk permanently damaging
your relationships.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.875
I'm great at relationships, Bob.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.877
Yeah, I know.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.922
I know you are.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.633
(door opens)

10:33.633 --> 10:34.509
(door closes)

10:36.136 --> 10:38.221
(sighs)

10:38.221 --> 10:39.472
-FELICIA: All right, come on.
-WOMAN: Next, please.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.515
FELICIA: We'll get you
a hot dog or something.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.850
-ZACK: Yes.
-Oh, James.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.184
Hi.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.394
Hey.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.812
H-How you doing?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.814
Uh, good, I'm good.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.109
Uh, ready to kick some owlbear
butt in this Ren's Legion game.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.402
ZACK:
You play Ren's Legion?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.904
Sure do. What clan you guys in?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.115
We're the Demon Boyz with a "Z."

10:57.115 --> 10:59.993
-That's-that's legit.
-What about you?

10:59.993 --> 11:03.288
You know, I had a crew, but we
had some creative differences.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.165
So now I'm rolling solo dolo.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.458
ZACK:
You can't be trying to face
a boss on your own.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.085
-You're gonna get eviscerated.
-Zachary.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.045
Be nice.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.214
I am proud of that use
of "eviscerated,"

11:13.214 --> 11:15.592
-that's good vocabulary.
Where'd you learn that?
-Reddit.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.970
Reddit? We have talked
about this before. Sorry.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.346
I got to get these kids fed.
All right, have a good one.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.848
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.892
Zacky, you better believe,
the second we get home,

11:23.892 --> 11:25.393
I am taking that tablet away.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.563
You know who's self-centered?
My mother.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.357
That's who is self-centered.
And if you are gonna see me

11:31.357 --> 11:33.276
in that same light, then,
like, I actually don't know

11:33.276 --> 11:34.819
that we should be dating at all.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.738
Do you know what I mean?
Like, can I even date a normie?

11:36.738 --> 11:40.158
-Okay, I cannot answer
that question for you.
-Oh, right.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.327
And, I mean, we don't have
enough volcano water

11:42.327 --> 11:44.162
-in the world
to get through that.
-Totally.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.496
Okay, time's up.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.040
Thank you, Samantha Fink
of Hit Pause: Boston.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.958
-No, no, no, no.
-Yeah.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.543
I don't think my time's up.
It hasn't been that long.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.961
-It is, babe.
-(mutters) Yeah.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.296
-Yeah.
-Thank you, though.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.672
But I...

11:54.672 --> 11:56.090
Could I get just like
five more minutes?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.259
No, sweetie, we've got...

11:58.259 --> 12:00.136
-We're really booked.
-I would, but sorry.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.137
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.181
-Um...
-Sorry.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.432
-No, that's okay.
-Best of luck with everything,
babe.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
Okay, I just...

12:06.267 --> 12:08.353
God, there was so much
that I had...

12:08.353 --> 12:10.063
I had wanted to ask you.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.689
-Especially about the movie.
-Tell-tell Alex I said hey.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.815
-Oh, yay.
-Oh, no, I will.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.983
But do you have any,
like, one-liners?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.735
The movie is great
and you'll love it.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.986
-It's gonna be so good,
you're gonna love it.
-Oh, okay.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.279
-Thank you so much.
-From Bob the Drag Queen.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
-Thank you.
-All right, bye, Sam.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.824
Okay, bye.
Did you need anything else?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.451
-I need a Red Bull.
That was a lot.
-Okay, I got you.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.828
BRIT (laughing):
Oh, my God, corn.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.915
Oh, Sam, look, this is Henry,
he's the star of Fading Farmland

12:28.915 --> 12:30.124
and he just got signed
as a model.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.751
-What?
-Yeah.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.586
-Sick.
-Okay, well, come back
if you have any questions

12:33.586 --> 12:34.462
about crop rotation.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.548
(sighs)

12:37.548 --> 12:39.342
Yo, Sam.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.426
Something big is happening.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.469
It's gonna be amazing.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.012
Oh, yeah? That's super cool.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.389
-You want to know what's
happening with me?
-Yeah.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.807
I just blew that interview
thanks to you.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.143
What do you mean
"thanks to me"?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.187
You picked a fight with me like
right before I went in there.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.022
I did not pick a fight with you.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.692
Samantha, I understand you're
going through a lot right now.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.193
But I cannot become
your punching bag.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.987
You're not my punching bag.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.905
You're my boyfriend,
and all I wanted from you

13:00.905 --> 13:02.532
was a little bit of support.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.033
But you weren't there at all.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.535
Now, how am I supposed
to know that?

13:05.535 --> 13:06.995
I'm just supposed
to read your mind?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.413
Is that how this
is supposed to work?

13:08.413 --> 13:09.998
-Please explain.
-Why do men always say that?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.709
It's not mind-reading, it's just
picking up on basic social cues.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.085
Why is that so hard?

13:14.085 --> 13:16.337
I'm impressed that you're
putting this all on me.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.755
-(sighs)
-I really am.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.424
Did you do this
to your friends or just me?

13:19.424 --> 13:22.719
No, I didn't. Felicia has a kid
and Brit is getting divorced.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.178
I don't know, I just thought
maybe my boyfriend

13:24.178 --> 13:25.805
could show up for me this time.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.433
Okay, well, I'm gonna put
a pause on this conversation

13:28.433 --> 13:29.809
because I'm not dealing with
this shit tonight, all right?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.019
Cool.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.520
Awesome.

13:34.981 --> 13:35.940
Very cool.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.321
♪ ♪

13:55.334 --> 13:57.795
(grunts)

13:57.795 --> 13:59.464
What? What is this?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.215
(sighs)

14:01.215 --> 14:02.175
I'm moving out.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.678
W-Wait, wait.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.431
I'm... No, I'm not in the mood
for any more drama today, Bob.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.515
Not today.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.770
Did you ever even want me here?

14:13.770 --> 14:15.438
Of course.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.231
What do you mean? You moved in.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.942
Yeah, but you never
really let me move in.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.944
We...

14:21.944 --> 14:23.571
eat at that table every day,

14:23.571 --> 14:25.615
we sleep in that bedroom
every night.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.742
Yeah, yeah, but per
your instructions,

14:27.742 --> 14:30.661
I keep all of my-my clothes
in the garage.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.498
It gets cold out there,
I have to microwave my pants.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.208
You're being
absolutely ridiculous.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.462
All right, you-you see?
Do you see these pans?

14:39.462 --> 14:41.589
I brought these pans
with me when I came.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.633
And I asked you not
to use a fork on them

14:43.633 --> 14:45.176
because they have
a non-stick coating.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.970
I asked you to be gentle.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.392
And you ignored me, and-and
you scratched them up anyway

14:53.392 --> 14:56.229
and now they're ruined.
This-this is us, Carol.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.107
We are two scratched-up skillets

14:59.107 --> 15:00.399
that don't work the way
they're supposed to.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.445
I will buy you
new skillets, Bob.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.447
I-I would love that, thank you.

15:06.447 --> 15:11.327
Okay, my-my point
about the pans...

15:11.327 --> 15:14.747
is that you're not great
at relationships.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.666
-(scoffs)
- You bulldoze...

15:16.666 --> 15:17.792
-Okay, no, no, no.
-...and you don't listen.

15:17.792 --> 15:18.960
No, no, no.
That's enough, that's enough.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.004
Okay, I want... I want us
to get better, I...

15:22.004 --> 15:24.757
I really want you to get better.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.219
And the only way I know how
to do that is for me to leave.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.720
And, unfortunately,
you're gonna have

15:29.720 --> 15:31.347
to figure out
the rest on your own.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.520
Please call me if you do.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.406
(door closes)

15:48.406 --> 15:50.074
(grunts)

15:50.074 --> 15:51.742
BOB THE DRAG QUEEN:
And that's when I learned

15:51.742 --> 15:54.954
the most crucial thing a first-
time director needs to know.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.373
But you're gonna have to tune in
to next week's episode

15:57.373 --> 15:58.708
to find out. All right, thank
you, everyone, goodbye.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.251
Mwah. See you next week.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.335
Hey.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.628
SAMANTHA:
Hey.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.883
Henry and I had the best time.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.886
He taught me all
about agronomics.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.804
And guess what. He's a doctor.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.431
A crop doctor.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.391
I mean, it's perfect.
We went to this afterparty...

16:15.391 --> 16:16.976
Brit, can we talk
about this another time?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.728
I-I'm sort of in the middle
of something right now.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.729
Damn, okay.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.439
What's wrong?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.274
-Uh, this piece is killing me.
-(phone buzzing)

16:23.274 --> 16:25.276
I mean, my interview was...
horrible,

16:25.276 --> 16:28.029
and Alex
will not stop calling me, I...

16:28.029 --> 16:31.282
Okay. Breathe. Let me see it.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.408
Uh...

16:32.408 --> 16:33.451
I'm sure it's fine. Let me see.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.869
(groans)

16:38.247 --> 16:39.248
BRIT:
Uh...

16:41.834 --> 16:43.002
It's a take.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.755
It's, um...

16:45.755 --> 16:48.257
Volcano water sounds
amazing now.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.592
-Okay, yeah.
-I feel like that's great.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.135
I told you it was...
it was rough.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.303
I mean...

16:54.138 --> 16:56.057
Is it just a transcript
of a podcast?

16:56.057 --> 16:58.517
'Cause I think you left this ad
in here about natural hair dye?

16:59.727 --> 17:01.562
I can take that part out!

17:03.064 --> 17:04.232
(knocks on door)

17:07.026 --> 17:08.569
MINDY:
You again.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.570
Why are you so obsessed with me?

17:11.405 --> 17:13.324
Is it cool if we party up?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.785
I got donut holes
and wet naps for the controllers

17:15.785 --> 17:18.037
so we don't get them dirty.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.247
Maybe some other time.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.791
Good luck with the swamp witch.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.501
You'll need an enchanted spear,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.337
but it's surrounded
by, um, a swarm of ants.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.256
So...

17:28.256 --> 17:31.259
S-So, uh, what I wanted to say
back there is...

17:31.259 --> 17:34.595
I actually got 20 days, um...

17:34.595 --> 17:35.680
Cool.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.557
I'm glad to hear that.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.891
Started going back to church.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.144
Um, so, that's been
helping a lot.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.063
I don't have a lot of people
to tell that to, so...

17:45.940 --> 17:49.443
Listen, I'm really sorry for
what happened back at 24/7.

17:49.443 --> 17:53.823
I embarrassed myself and, um...

17:53.823 --> 17:55.324
I really appreciate
you talking to me.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.286
My clan is pretty small
these days.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.290
(sighs)

18:02.290 --> 18:03.332
-(groaning on video game)
-Oh, my God, save me.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.001
-I-I can't.
-Why aren't you saving me?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.544
I'm a paladin,
I can't do anything.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.170
No, no, no.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.880
Oh, take that, you hairy bitch.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.971
(sighing)

18:21.142 --> 18:22.184
Alex?

18:22.184 --> 18:25.646
Oh, hey, Samantha.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.609
Um... Why haven't you answered
any of my phone calls?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.943
I called you like 20 times.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.695
Yeah, I was busy,
I was working, okay?

18:32.695 --> 18:34.822
I mean, what are you...

18:34.822 --> 18:36.407
What are you doing here?
Is this about our fight?

18:36.407 --> 18:38.117
No, it's not about the fight.

18:38.117 --> 18:42.079
I-I'm... Nathaniel is taking
a permanent leave of absence.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.999
And they couldn't find
another editor,

18:44.999 --> 18:47.752
so the bosses called the devil
that they knew and...

18:47.752 --> 18:48.836
Here we are.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.425
So, you're, uh,
you're my boss again?

18:55.926 --> 18:58.888
Yeah, I'm your boss again.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.807
-Sick.
-Yeah.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.811
So, I-I think that me and you
should sit down soon and...

19:05.811 --> 19:07.355
just figure out what that means

19:07.355 --> 19:10.066
and the next steps.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.277
Yeah, no, that, uh, makes sense.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.489
Uh, anyway, I should probably
get out of your office.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.366
Yeah, and we have that staff
meeting. I'll see you there.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.408
-Oh, cool.
-Great.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.368
-Can't...
-Okay, cool.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.494
-Can't wait.
-Yep.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.245
And, oh, yo.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.248
Send me the write-up
from the film festival.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.876
-Oh, yeah, the film
festival thing.
-Yeah.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.211
That's...

19:30.211 --> 19:32.171
You know, it's not
totally polished yet.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.673
I feel like it could use
a few more, like...

19:33.673 --> 19:34.757
-(clicks tongue)
-Oh, come on.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.175
I know the interview
didn't go well,

19:36.175 --> 19:37.468
but I'm sure it's still good.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.594
Send it by end of day.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.553
-Oh, end of the day?
-Yeah.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.889
(laughs):
Okay, great.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.351
Shit.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.523
The nice thing about getting
abandoned is, it makes you

19:50.523 --> 19:55.277
realize maybe
I'm also the asshole.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.488
Nobody arguing that.
Okay, noted, uh...

19:57.488 --> 19:59.281
(laughter)

19:59.281 --> 20:01.992
Uh, I'm sick
of hearing myself talk.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.411
Would anyone like to share?

20:05.162 --> 20:06.914
All right, that's our meeting.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.208
I will see everyone across
at the coffee shop.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.586
Carol?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.591
Um...

20:22.471 --> 20:24.306
I'm Carol.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.766
You all know that.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.477
Um...

20:33.149 --> 20:36.736
I guess I'm talking
today because...

20:36.736 --> 20:39.780
I haven't felt this alone

20:39.780 --> 20:41.615
since my husband died.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.457
