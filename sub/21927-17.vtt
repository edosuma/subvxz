00:01.710 --> 00:03.042
<i>In any ecosystem,</i>

00:03.253 --> 00:07.839
<i>you'll find a delicate balance
between predator and prey.</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.336
<i>Some well-known predators</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:12.009
<i>include</i> Panthera leo,

00:12.721 --> 00:14.303
Ursus arctos,

00:14.515 --> 00:17.508
<i>and star of the
1987 film</i> Predator,

00:18.060 --> 00:19.050
<i>Predator.</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:21.226
<i>Now, examples of prey</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:24.272
<i>include</i> Oryctolagus cuniculus,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.391
Gallus gallus domesticus,

00:26.610 --> 00:29.227
<i>and weighing in at 58 pounds
soaking wet,</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.237
Diminutive homo novus...

00:31.448 --> 00:33.064
<i>curiously, a close relative</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.866
<i>of</i> Gallus gallus domesticus.

00:48.257 --> 00:48.917
<i>Cooper.</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:50.506
Your stop.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.964
Would you mind dropping me off
closer to my house?

00:54.263 --> 00:55.925
You know I'm not allowed
to do that.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.927
What if I did your taxes?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.848
Sorry, kiddo.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.222
I could've gotten you
a nice refund.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.557
<i>The perilous journey</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:09.688
<i>from the bus stop
to my front door</i>

01:09.903 --> 01:12.111
<i>was 97.5 meters.</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:15.194
<i>FYI, insisting on using
the metric system</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:18.823
<i>in East Texas is another reason
I was hunted by predators.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:53.110
<i>Homo novus</i> needs a Yoo-hoo.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.636
Jiu-jitsu?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.465
I've decided
to learn self-defense.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.141
- Why?
- I'm quite small,

02:24.353 --> 02:26.561
and will be for several years,

02:26.772 --> 02:28.559
maybe even more
if I'm a late bloomer.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.141
Your dad's big,
maybe you'll take after him.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.601
We both like my mom.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.981
I think that's where
the similarities end.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.528
<i>You know, one of
the books mentioned</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:38.527
a Vietnamese martial art.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.734
Vovinam. I'm a blue belt.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.909
- Wow.
- Don't be impressed.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.033
It's what you get when
your mom buys the uniform.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.989
Do you remember any of it?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.791
I don't even know
where the belt is.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.838
<i>The book says jiu-jitsu</i>

02:54.049 --> 02:55.540
is based on using
your attacker's

02:55.759 --> 02:56.966
momentum against them.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.673
It's just physics. Come at me.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.504
Like, run at you?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.511
Well, I'm new to this,
so maybe just walk quickly.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.134
And what happens
when I get to you?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.436
I'll use your inertia
to take you down.

03:09.064 --> 03:09.679
Okay.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.979
And when does inertia
take me down?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.901
Any second.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.787
I don't understand.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.239
I'm using physics.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.250
This leg lock is called
an Outside Ashi Garami.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.081
What happens next?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.087
That depends,
is this your foot or mine?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.344
<i>Cooper. Your stop.</i>

04:08.749 --> 04:09.990
Ahh.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.122
I bowled a new high
score last night.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.077
Nice.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.418
- I got two turkeys.
- What's a turkey?

04:18.632 --> 04:19.999
It's three strikes
in a row.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.800
Why do they call it a turkey?

04:22.137 --> 04:25.551
Well, when they first
invented bowling,

04:25.766 --> 04:29.055
they used to just throw
frozen turkeys at the pins.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.477
Eventually,
they switched to balls

04:31.688 --> 04:33.896
to cut down on the smell.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.518
Why you lying to her?

04:35.734 --> 04:38.101
I find it keeps
my mind sharp.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.148
Sheldon, breakfast!

04:40.363 --> 04:41.604
<i>Be right there!</i>

04:46.536 --> 04:47.697
<i>Sheldon!</i>

04:47.913 --> 04:49.074
Coming!

05:02.719 --> 05:03.630
Hello.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.677
Shelly,
you all right?

05:05.889 --> 05:06.504
Yes.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.679
I must be a little sore

05:07.891 --> 05:10.258
from doing jiu-jitsu
with Tam yesterday.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.968
Why were you doing jiu-jitsu?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.016
We're boys.
Roughhousing is what we do.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.195
- What was that?
- What was what?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.738
That sound.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.154
What sound?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.531
What's all this?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.912
An extra layer
of protection.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.663
Protection from what?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.417
Sweetie, is someone
bothering you?

05:41.216 --> 05:43.128
- Yes.
- Who is it?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.834
I'd rather not talk about it.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.669
No, I want a name
right now.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.548
Mary.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.346
Have you been hurting him?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.220
Only with my words.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.800
Tell me who
it is, Shelly.

05:53.228 --> 05:53.934
Mary, slow down.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.636
Don't tell me
to slow down.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.768
- Someone is bullying him.
- Okay.

05:58.108 --> 05:58.894
Okay.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.692
Sheldon, you can't go to school
wearing all that.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.394
Go to your room and take it off.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.399
Yes, sir.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.528
You go with him.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.075
But my cereal's gonna get soggy.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.778
Go.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.699
I'd like one nice morning.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.700
Why aren't you
more upset about this?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.457
I am. I just think we should
proceed with caution.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.331
- Someone is hurting our son.
- I understand.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.257
But handling bullies
is tricky. It...

06:25.468 --> 06:27.334
It's easy to
make things worse.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.170
And what makes you the expert?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.302
Honey, I was a bully.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.591
<i>He's right.</i>

06:34.185 --> 06:35.767
You get involved in this
in the wrong way,

06:35.979 --> 06:38.722
and they'll take it out
on Sheldon.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.398
Well, I'm sorry,
but I can't just stand by.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.278
Georgie, I need to talk
to you, and wake up,

06:50.493 --> 06:51.904
<i>you're gonna be late.</i>

06:52.120 --> 06:54.954
Got it covered.
I slept in my clothes.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.329
Oh, Lord. Look, somebody has
been picking on your brother.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.579
You know anything
about it?

06:59.878 --> 07:00.618
No.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.291
You better not be
covering for anybody.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.168
I'm not. Most kids
at school ignore him,

07:05.383 --> 07:06.840
and the girls
all think he's cute.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.168
It's kind of annoying.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.670
Well, I need you
to look after him.

07:11.139 --> 07:11.754
Why?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.556
Because I'm your mother,
and I'm asking you nicely.

07:14.935 --> 07:15.925
What if I don't want to?

07:16.144 --> 07:18.932
I don't care, you're doing it.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.223
<i>How was that nice?</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:25.317
So there I was flying
above the city,

07:25.528 --> 07:27.690
but when I woke up,
I couldn't fly.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.148
That's like the dream you had
where you were dating Madonna,

07:30.367 --> 07:32.324
but when you woke up,
you weren't.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.275
Exactly.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.578
You ever have the ones where
your teeth are falling out?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.906
Better my teeth
than my hair, but...

07:39.084 --> 07:41.246
- Sheldon?
<i>- Over here.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.040
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.120
From who?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.842
Is Billy the one
giving you trouble?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.131
No.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.216
<i>His dad?</i>

07:53.431 --> 07:54.387
No.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.759
No...

08:01.314 --> 08:02.350
She's a demon.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.400
The little Sparks girl?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.652
You're kidding.
She seems so sweet.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.325
He says she slaps him around,
takes his lunch money.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.119
She even put a tadpole
down his shirt.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.491
Poor kid,
he tucks in those shirts.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.503
- She looks harmless.
- She's cute.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.009
So she probably gets
away with stuff.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.806
I'm like that.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.510
I wonder if stray cats
poop in that sandbox.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.510
<i>George.</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.187
You need to talk
to her parents.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.609
Me? Why me?

08:48.820 --> 08:51.437
Because you're more
intimidating than me.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.897
That's rich.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.871
Hey, Billy.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.497
Hello, Missy's dad.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.122
- Is your father home?
- Yes.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.667
Could you get him for me?

09:12.969 --> 09:13.880
Happy to.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.554
Dad, it's Missy's dad!

09:16.931 --> 09:19.048
<i>He's also Sheldon's dad!</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:20.303
<i>Well, howdy, neighbor.</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:21.508
Hey, Herschel.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.344
What brings you by?
Chickens too loud?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.475
- Nah, they been fine.
<i>- Good, good.</i>

09:25.690 --> 09:27.397
Fried up the noisy one
last week.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.601
That shut him up.
Anyway, how can I help?

09:29.819 --> 09:30.855
Uh, well...

09:31.362 --> 09:33.354
It's come to my
attention that, uh...

09:34.365 --> 09:36.778
Sheldon's run into a bit
of trouble with your daughter.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.488
What kind of trouble?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.986
He says she been beating on him.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.077
- My Bobbi?
- Yeah.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.492
This one? The six-year-old?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.454
Bobbi, get over here!

09:49.672 --> 09:52.130
You realize I've taken dumps
bigger than this kid.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.134
- Hi, Daddy.
<i>- Hey, babydoll, uh,</i>

09:55.345 --> 09:58.713
Mr. Cooper says that you've
been picking on Sheldon.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.800
- Now, is that true?
- No, Daddy.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.384
Are you sure?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.266
<i>Okay, go wash up
for dinner.</i>

10:08.024 --> 10:09.231
<i>I don't know what
to tell you, George.</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:10.478
I mean, is it,
is it possible

10:10.693 --> 10:12.104
your son has a
little crush on her?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.186
Oh, I don't think
he's wired that way.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.610
Oh, are you saying
that he's a...

10:16.825 --> 10:20.068
No, no, I'm saying he's
a bookworm.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.994
Unless she's math or a
dictionary, he ain't interested.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.580
- Mm.
- Yeah.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.166
Thanks for hearin' me out.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.664
Your wife sent you over here,
didn't she?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.120
I don't want to talk about it.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.462
I bet she did!

10:32.674 --> 10:33.710
Not talkin' about it!

10:33.925 --> 10:35.211
Tell her I said hi!

10:39.764 --> 10:40.800
How'd it go?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.261
Uh, good. Yeah.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.675
I handled it.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.430
Oh, thank the Lord.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.308
Yeah. Me and the Lord.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.730
Team effort.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.456
Hello, Bobbi.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.788
You told on me.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.960
<i>Well, actually,
my brother</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:15.506
figured it out, so, technically,
I would argue that I didn't.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.170
Doesn't matter.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.051
Uh, I should let you know,

11:20.263 --> 11:21.845
I've read a book
on jiu-jitsu.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.803
And I'm prepared
to throw it at you.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.892
Shelly, it's just Bactine.

11:33.109 --> 11:33.895
Aah!

11:34.110 --> 11:35.146
I didn't even put it

11:35.361 --> 11:36.602
on you yet.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.781
You want to tell me
what happened?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.404
Bobbi Sparks
came into the garage...

11:43.703 --> 11:44.989
And she attacked you?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.989
Not exactly.
I tried to use jiu-jitsu on her,

11:48.208 --> 11:49.619
but I tripped and fell.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.453
Aw, baby. I'm so sorry
you're havin' to deal with this.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.502
<i>It's okay.</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:57.422
German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche said,

11:57.634 --> 12:00.092
"That which does not kill us
makes us stronger."

12:00.762 --> 12:02.219
And do you feel stronger?

12:03.890 --> 12:04.801
No.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.720
How are the knees?

12:08.019 --> 12:09.180
Better, thank you.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.806
Good.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.439
And regarding this jiu-jitsu
stuff, you should know

12:13.650 --> 12:16.142
that a man's not supposed
to raise his hand to a woman.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.978
Oh, I won't. I don't want
to hurt myself again.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.776
Did you ever have a bully
when you were growing up?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.406
Have you met your grandma?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.040
I thought you said
you handled it next door.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.039
I did say that.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.412
Where you goin'?

12:37.632 --> 12:38.964
To handle it.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.504
Should've been you
in the first place.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.672
What?

12:42.887 --> 12:43.923
Good luck!

12:46.557 --> 12:49.675
<i>Way to go, Scooby!
That's my newshound!</i>

12:51.521 --> 12:53.558
Missy, I could
really use your help.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.388
With what?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.974
I'm being bullied
by Bobbi Sparks.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.525
Hilarious. Go on.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.897
<i>Madame Doo!</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:01.186
<i>That's me!</i>

13:02.073 --> 13:05.612
Mom says a man should never
raise his hand to a woman.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.614
But I believe I've
found a loophole.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.570
You're a woman, so
you're allowed to hit her

13:09.789 --> 13:10.950
as much as you want.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.573
Why would I do that?

13:12.792 --> 13:13.828
Because I'm willing to pay you.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.079
How much?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.207
My life savings,
four dollars.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.745
That's a good start.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.377
Now, let's talk TV privileges.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.624
What do you want?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.214
Complete control
every afternoon for two months.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.467
That's when
Professor Proton is on.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.052
I know. Sucks for you.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.182
I'm on fire!

13:41.321 --> 13:42.232
Hello, Brenda.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.733
Oh, hey, Mary.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.696
How many lanes you need?

13:44.907 --> 13:47.024
Actually, I'm here
to talk to you.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.651
Seems that our kids
are havin' a little problem.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.870
Yeah. Herschel told me.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.580
Oh, good, good.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.999
So, I was wondering what
you're plannin' to do about it,

13:56.210 --> 13:58.497
'cause the situation doesn't
seem to be gettin' any better.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.253
Well, if you haven't noticed,

14:00.548 --> 14:02.164
I'm at work right now.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.090
I see that.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.588
But you understand

14:05.803 --> 14:07.760
that your daughter's being
abusive to my son.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.132
Well, maybe your son needs
to grow a pair.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.928
And in due time, he will.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.635
But right now, I expect you

14:14.854 --> 14:16.720
to teach your children
how to behave.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.899
Connie Tucker
to the front desk, please.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.605
<i>Connie Tucker.</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:24.228
Why are
you calling her?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.279
You say my daughter's
harassing your son.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.029
Well, her daughter's
harassing me.

14:30.161 --> 14:30.947
<i>Hey, Mary.</i>

14:31.162 --> 14:33.119
- What are you doin' here?
- Well,

14:33.331 --> 14:35.948
I was hopin' to have a rational
conversation about Shelly,

14:36.167 --> 14:37.954
but there's only one person
being rational.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.831
Uh, and it ain't you.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.871
Could you excuse us
for just a minute?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.126
Do you understand
that you are in the place

14:47.345 --> 14:49.428
where I socialize three
to four days a week?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.926
So you care more about bowling
than your grandson?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.052
Of course not.
I'm just saying

14:53.267 --> 14:55.133
maybe there's a better way
to go about it.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.595
Now, I'm warnin' you,
Brenda is one mean...

14:57.939 --> 14:59.180
I know you don't like
bad language,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.766
but we are in a bowling alley...
one mean bitch.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.188
Well, I can be mean, too.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.732
Okay, you listen to me.
You get your kid

15:06.948 --> 15:07.984
<i>in line or I...</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:10.323
What are you doing?

15:10.535 --> 15:11.241
<i>Get out of here.</i>

15:11.452 --> 15:12.863
This is my place of business.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.579
And now I see
where your daughter gets it.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.656
<i>You know what?</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:19.457
I have been nothin' but nice

15:19.669 --> 15:21.581
to you and your family
since the day y'all moved in,

15:21.796 --> 15:22.786
and I'm over it.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.546
Watching you walk
around all holier

15:24.757 --> 15:25.964
than thou, like you're better

15:26.175 --> 15:27.962
<i>than everyone else.
Well, guess what,</i>

15:28.177 --> 15:29.463
you're not.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.551
I'm gonna pray for you.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.179
She says that to me
all the time.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.347
I'm not even sure she does it.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.238
How'd it go?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.820
I don't want
to talk about it.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.283
Is that pine?

15:58.583 --> 15:59.744
We're not talkin' about it.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.916
And you get that!

16:08.217 --> 16:09.753
- Herschel.
- Hey, George.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.210
It has come to my attention

16:11.429 --> 16:13.921
that your wife went to speak
with my wife

16:14.140 --> 16:15.597
at her place of work,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.674
- and, uh...
- She send you over here?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.765
Uh, the-the important thing is
that I'm here to tell you

16:20.980 --> 16:23.643
that, uh, Mary's behavior
was inappropriate.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.265
You know, it's interesting.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.317
When I came to your house,
you were laughin',

16:27.570 --> 16:28.401
and...

16:28.613 --> 16:30.149
now you're all serious.

16:30.781 --> 16:31.441
Why is that?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.281
What do you say
we go talk about this

16:33.493 --> 16:35.029
somewhere
a little more comfortable?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.655
<i>Who's at the door?</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:48.462
Make yourself at home.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.960
Oh, boy.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.212
You hang out in here?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.213
Sure.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.464
<i>Once you get used to the smell,</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:55.386
it's not so bad.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.805
I coach a high
school football team.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.132
This smells like petunias.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.762
I like to...

16:59.977 --> 17:02.310
take a break
from the family and...

17:02.522 --> 17:04.809
come out here
and watch the games.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.356
Ooh!

17:08.861 --> 17:09.977
Your wife don't mind?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.060
<i>She don't know.</i>

17:11.280 --> 17:12.361
She's scared
to death of chickens.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.280
- Is that right?
- Once I found out,

17:14.492 --> 17:16.654
buildin' this coop
was a no-brainer.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.039
You were gone so long.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.371
How did it go?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.163
Well...

17:31.008 --> 17:32.044
One lump or two?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.467
Two, please.

17:35.221 --> 17:35.927
Billy?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.051
Why would I want
lumpy tea?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.257
Isn't he pretty?

17:40.476 --> 17:41.341
Very pretty.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.018
I feel pretty.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.897
I handled it.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.812
Thank you so much.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.647
We're family. It's what we do.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.368
Listen, I'm sorry my wife
went down to the bowling alley.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.451
Please, I'm sorry Brenda
made me come to your door.

18:06.669 --> 18:07.375
I'm not.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.544
This is the most fun
I've had all week.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.873
I-I feel bad about
the whole thing with the kids.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.799
Hey, it happens.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.469
I know, but Bobbi shouldn't be
beatin' on Sheldon like that.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.387
- It's not okay.
- What's not okay

18:19.599 --> 18:21.511
is Sheldon gettin' beat
up by a little girl.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.549
Well...

18:23.436 --> 18:24.176
Yeah.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.055
Look, I'll talk to Bobbi.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.307
I don't know if it'll help,
but I'll try.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.442
- Hey, you're a good man.
- Mm.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.275
Yeah, I-I should
be headin' back.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.445
Mm.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.899
All right, well, look,
come on by anytime.

18:39.118 --> 18:39.824
Yeah.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.370
You know, we should probably get
our stories straight

18:43.581 --> 18:45.243
before we talk
to our respective...

18:45.833 --> 18:47.074
- mates.
- Sure.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.158
What do you want to say?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.418
How 'bout this?

18:51.505 --> 18:52.586
We had words,

18:52.882 --> 18:54.123
it almost got ugly,

18:54.342 --> 18:55.878
but we came to an understanding.

18:56.093 --> 18:56.753
- I like that.
- Yeah.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.085
You want to take
a swing at me?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.385
Make it look real?

18:59.597 --> 19:02.761
I have a freakishly high
tolerance for pain.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.304
No, no.
But you're sweet for offering.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.769
- You have a good night.
- You, too, pal.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.016
<i>Herschel!</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:11.022
<i>Where the hell
are you?!</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:12.098
Shh.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.894
I built a hidey-hole under here,

19:15.112 --> 19:17.024
but there's only room
for one of us.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.407
<i>Where is that fat dumbass?</i>

19:21.285 --> 19:24.323
Believe it or not, that means
I'm gettin' lucky tonight.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.788
Y'all have an
odd relationship.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.662
Love is a mysterious thing.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.834
<i>Herschel!</i>

19:37.551 --> 19:40.510
<i>Existing in a
world of predators isn't easy,</i>

19:40.721 --> 19:43.589
<i>but we prey have developed
several natural defenses</i>

19:43.808 --> 19:45.049
<i>to help us survive.</i>

19:45.267 --> 19:46.508
<i>There's playing dead,</i>

19:46.727 --> 19:48.593
<i>warning calls, camouflage...</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:53.564
<i>...and, last
but certainly not least,</i>

19:53.776 --> 19:55.392
<i>good old-fashioned
running away.</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:04.784
<i>A little screaming
never hurts either.</i>
