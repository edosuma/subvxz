when my parents drop me off
at PCA,

21:16.441 --> 21:18.026
I cry for two hours.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.194
[laughter]
Yeah, just crying.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.238
Just all day.
[cheers and applause]

21:21.321 --> 21:24.741

on my right foot.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.617
[cheers and applause]

21:25.701 --> 21:26.660
MICHAEL: That's disgusting.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.912
Yeah.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.540
- Every dog I ever had

21:31.623 --> 21:33.208
bit me and ran away.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.254
[scattered applause]

21:39.131 --> 21:42.426

21:45.762 --> 21:47.431

- All right.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.225

my degree in teaching.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.477
MAN: Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

21:52.561 --> 21:54.730

that's as smart as us.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.981
That's what I'm talking about.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.315
- And guess what.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.860
You guys know the suntan lotion,

21:59.943 --> 22:00.944
Golden Tone?

22:01.028 --> 22:02.988
- Yeah.
- Yes, yeah.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.239
- Well, the picture
of the little girl

22:04.322 --> 22:07.075
on the bottle showing
her bare butt?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.869
That was me
when I was four years old.

22:08.952 --> 22:13.040
[cheers and applause]

22:15.500 --> 22:18.462
And you know what I feel
like doing now?
