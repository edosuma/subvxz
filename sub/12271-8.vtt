00:12.970 --> 00:14.608
It's horrible, Ryan.

00:14.675 --> 00:16.777
Wilfred can't even walk up or down stairs.

00:16.845 --> 00:18.516
I have to carry him in and out any time

00:18.584 --> 00:19.520
he has to go to the bathroom.

00:19.588 --> 00:20.759
He has a checkup today.

00:20.826 --> 00:22.130
I feel like everyone at the vet

00:22.198 --> 00:23.165
is judging me.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.702
Jenna, it was an accident.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.250
Everybody knows how much you love Wilfred.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.626
WILFRED: Ho, ho,

00:30.693 --> 00:34.468
shit, three-legged dog is in the house!

00:34.536 --> 00:36.072
Look how sad he is.

00:36.139 --> 00:38.512
He's been sulking like that for weeks.

00:38.579 --> 00:40.118
It just kills me to see him like this.

00:40.185 --> 00:41.756
Hey,

00:41.824 --> 00:43.029
why don't I take him for a walk?

00:43.097 --> 00:45.400
Maybe that'll cheer him up.

00:45.468 --> 00:47.673
And, if you want,
I can take him to the checkup, too.

00:47.741 --> 00:49.173
You don't have to do that.

00:49.241 --> 00:50.974
- It's not a problem. 
- Really?

00:51.042 --> 00:52.111
Thanks, Ryan.

00:52.178 --> 00:53.447
Yeah.

00:53.515 --> 00:54.951
Ryan and Big Stump

00:55.021 --> 00:57.541
going to the vet together!

00:58.828 --> 01:00.130
I'm telling you, Ryan,

01:00.198 --> 01:02.870
being a three-legged dog is the shit.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.772
Good for you.

01:04.839 --> 01:06.375
Why aren't you happier for me?

01:06.443 --> 01:08.956
Oh, I feel bad for Jenna.

01:08.982 --> 01:10.885
She's never gonna forgive herself 
for what happened to you.

01:10.952 --> 01:12.421
And it's not like I can tell her that

01:12.489 --> 01:14.394
being a three-legged dog is the shit.

01:14.462 --> 01:16.064
Well, what are you gonna do, then?

01:16.132 --> 01:17.899
What <i> can</i> I do?

01:17.967 --> 01:20.240
Think she's gonna have to
get through this herself.

01:20.307 --> 01:22.588
Just gonna keep my distance.

01:22.614 --> 01:25.118
Uh, Ryan.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.287
Uh, aren't you forgetting something?

01:27.355 --> 01:30.261
(sighs)

01:30.328 --> 01:31.964
(grunts)

01:33.438 --> 01:35.774
Sounds to me like you're afraid.

01:35.842 --> 01:37.310
Afraid of what?

01:37.378 --> 01:39.216
Ryan, if you care about Jenna...

01:39.283 --> 01:41.322
Just drop it, okay? It's not happening.

01:41.389 --> 01:42.725
Fine. Be a pussy.

01:42.793 --> 01:44.261
Keep your true feelings to yourself.

01:44.329 --> 01:46.498
You're acting like it's my fault.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.471
She kissed me and pushed me away.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.677
(clears his throat)

01:52.682 --> 01:54.251
(Ryan groans loudly)

01:54.318 --> 01:55.753
(panting)

01:55.821 --> 01:58.429
Wilfred, I can't keep doing this.

01:58.496 --> 01:59.632
Stop being so dramatic.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.203
I only weigh 38 pounds.

02:02.271 --> 02:03.772
Oh, did I say something funny, Bear?

02:03.840 --> 02:04.775
Yeah, I'm not the one sucking in my cheeks

02:04.843 --> 02:06.647
every time I look in the mirror.

02:06.715 --> 02:08.449
That's not the face the rest
of the world sees, Bear.

02:08.518 --> 02:10.354
You're a very heavyset individual.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.990
Uh, you're gonna have to learn

02:12.057 --> 02:13.724
to navigate the stairs by yourself.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.994
Uh, I don't think so.

02:16.062 --> 02:18.199
That's what being a
three-legged dog is all about.

02:18.267 --> 02:20.402
Being waited upon.

02:23.807 --> 02:26.645
(water gurgling)

02:30.685 --> 02:33.456
(clears his throat, coughs loudly)

02:33.524 --> 02:35.659
(coughing)

02:35.727 --> 02:37.997
What about Jenna?

02:38.065 --> 02:39.700
If you weren't so helpless,

02:39.768 --> 02:42.404
- maybe she wouldn't feel so guilty. 
- (sighs)

02:42.472 --> 02:44.992
Imagine the big smile on
her face when she can see

02:45.044 --> 02:46.884
that you can climb the
stairs all by yourself.

02:46.910 --> 02:49.350
Wait a minute.
This isn't about Jenna's smile.

02:49.418 --> 02:52.156
This is about you not being
able to carry 38 pounds.

02:52.224 --> 02:54.326
You weigh a lot more than 38 pounds.

02:54.394 --> 02:56.028
How dare you!

02:56.095 --> 02:57.294
Maybe you're the one who's afraid.

02:57.362 --> 02:59.296
I'm not afraid of anything.

02:59.364 --> 03:00.765
Well, then, prove it.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.470
Climb up the stairs.

03:02.537 --> 03:04.436
Fine.

03:04.504 --> 03:06.606
I shall.

03:11.846 --> 03:13.413
What are you waiting for?

03:13.481 --> 03:15.001
I'm-I'm just thinking of, uh, you know,

03:15.050 --> 03:17.530
the list of stuff I've got to do today,
and just...

03:17.584 --> 03:19.050
Come on, do it for Jenna. Ryan.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.017
Ryan, put me down! Put me down!

03:21.084 --> 03:23.618
Screw Jenna.
I don't... I don't care about her.

03:23.685 --> 03:25.453
Get me down, Ryan! Get me down!

03:25.521 --> 03:26.854
Oh.

03:26.922 --> 03:29.256
(panting)

03:30.725 --> 03:32.491
Okay, now pick me up.

03:32.559 --> 03:35.039
It's time to go to the vet.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.368
(grunts)

03:38.436 --> 03:40.070
Wilfred seems to be in good spirits.

03:40.138 --> 03:41.605
Yeah, other than climbing up stairs,

03:41.673 --> 03:43.107
he's adjusting really well.

03:43.175 --> 03:45.209
Give him time. He'll get there.

03:45.277 --> 03:47.881
The good news is,
his wound has healed nicely.

03:47.949 --> 03:50.650
Oh. That's great.

03:50.718 --> 03:52.417
There is one other thing, though.

03:52.485 --> 03:54.965
I saw something unusual on Wilfred's X ray.

03:54.987 --> 03:56.790
It appears that Wilfred has a mass.

03:56.857 --> 03:59.762
It's probably nothing...
most of these things are...

03:59.830 --> 04:01.765
but I'd like to run some tests to be sure.

04:01.832 --> 04:04.301
- Of course.
- So, I'll be back to take a tissue sample,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.002
and we'll have the results
in a couple of days.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.703
Should we be worried?

04:07.770 --> 04:09.438
I wouldn't be.

04:09.505 --> 04:12.140
It's very rare for a
dog to have lung cancer.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.678
- Wilfred, calm down.
- Calm down? I'm dying of lung cancer.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.306
And it's all your fault!

04:23.332 --> 04:25.771
You blowing all that
secondhand smoke in my face.

04:25.838 --> 04:27.739
Let's not overreact.

04:27.807 --> 04:29.374
The vet said it was probably nothing.

04:29.441 --> 04:30.876
And, for the record,

04:30.944 --> 04:32.411
you've inhaled plenty of 
firsthand smoke, too.

04:32.479 --> 04:34.180
Oh.

04:34.248 --> 04:36.616
(phone buzzes)

04:36.684 --> 04:39.453
- It's Jenna. 
- Oh, my God.

04:39.521 --> 04:41.722
Uh... hey.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.892
Um, the-the checkup?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.962
Uh, uh, it went... it went great.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.932
Great? I have a lump in my lung.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.402
Yeah, yeah, there was no
charge for the follow-up.

04:52.469 --> 04:55.170
Yeah, the-the vet said that
his wound healed up perfectly,

04:55.237 --> 04:56.569
and-and he's as good as new.

04:56.637 --> 04:58.404
Tell... her!

04:58.472 --> 05:00.841
She needs to know my lung
may have breast cancer.

05:00.909 --> 05:04.475
Yeah, yeah. See you later.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.544
What the hell was that?

05:06.611 --> 05:09.480
She was already upset about your arm.

05:09.548 --> 05:12.348
- Why give her something more to worry about?
- Yeah.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.353
Why give her a reason to
turn to you for comfort?

05:15.421 --> 05:16.788
That's "sca-wy."

05:16.856 --> 05:18.690
That has nothing to do with it.

05:18.756 --> 05:20.588
Why would I tell her you have lung cancer

05:20.656 --> 05:22.288
when we don't even know if you do?

05:22.356 --> 05:23.596
Oh, fine.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.329
(sighs deeply)

05:26.396 --> 05:29.596
But there is someone who
needs to know the truth.

05:29.664 --> 05:31.998
Bear doesn't deal well with bad news.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.167
- I really think you should tell Bear.
- I can't.

05:34.235 --> 05:37.403
Bear will never believe it coming from me.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.702
I used the terminal cancer excuse last year

05:39.770 --> 05:42.472
to get out of spending the high
holidays with Bear's family.

05:42.539 --> 05:45.406
That reminds me.
Don't call me Wilfred in front of Bear.

05:45.474 --> 05:48.044
I'm his emotionally available
twin brother, Todd.

05:48.112 --> 05:51.527
Wilfred died of leukemia
just before Yom Kippur.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.758
Fine.

06:00.631 --> 06:03.633
Bear, there's something I need to tell you.

06:03.701 --> 06:06.972
We went to the vet earlier today, and

06:07.040 --> 06:08.540
it looks like Wilfred...

06:08.607 --> 06:10.072
Bup, bup.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.973
Sorry.<i> Todd</i> has a tumor.

06:13.041 --> 06:15.344
But the vet said it was probably nothing,

06:15.412 --> 06:17.414
so there's not really
anything to worry about.

06:17.482 --> 06:19.714
Ryan's being kind. I'm going to die.

06:19.782 --> 06:21.718
Probably tomorrow.

06:21.785 --> 06:23.787
Maybe even later today.

06:23.855 --> 06:26.957
Either way,

06:27.025 --> 06:29.294
I'm not going to be able to make it

06:29.362 --> 06:31.664
to your high school reunion this weekend.

06:31.733 --> 06:36.402
Oh, Bear, no. Don't.

06:37.759 --> 06:40.495
What did I tell you?

06:41.111 --> 06:43.773
Well, don't just stand there. Comfort Bear.

06:43.799 --> 06:45.838
Wilfred...

06:45.906 --> 06:48.440
Ryan.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.575
(sighs)

06:58.387 --> 07:01.658
There, there, Bear.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.225
There, there.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.259
What are you doing?

07:10.327 --> 07:12.025
Writing my bucket list.

07:13.509 --> 07:15.763
- Wilfred...
- I know what you're gonna say.

07:15.831 --> 07:17.531
But if I don't get a jump on these things,

07:17.599 --> 07:18.965
and it turns out I do have cancer,

07:19.033 --> 07:20.500
I'll never have time to get them all done.

07:20.568 --> 07:22.068
As it is, it's unlikely.

07:22.136 --> 07:24.499
Some of these things could
take years to complete.

07:24.525 --> 07:26.039
Like what?

07:26.106 --> 07:30.276
Oh, like... finally catching my tail.

07:30.748 --> 07:32.088
How am I going to build

07:32.114 --> 07:35.384
a teleoperated android
of myself so lifelike,

07:35.452 --> 07:37.454
it fools my tail into following it,

07:37.522 --> 07:39.157
and a plutonium-powered,
motion-activated guillotine

07:39.225 --> 07:41.528
that's small enough to
install in the android's

07:41.596 --> 07:44.076
hind quarters, but large enough
to terminate the tail

07:44.134 --> 07:47.535
when it's within striking range?

07:47.603 --> 07:51.273
Holy shit!

07:51.340 --> 07:53.210
Ryan, do you realize what you've just done?

07:53.278 --> 07:55.478
You saved me trillions of dollars

07:55.546 --> 07:57.015
in research and development.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.386
Also, you've given me an idea.

07:59.454 --> 08:01.255
With your help, I may be able

08:01.323 --> 08:04.059
to accomplish everything
on the list after all.

08:04.127 --> 08:06.495
- Wilfred, we have plenty of time.
- Ryan, please.

08:07.322 --> 08:09.590
Will you help me or not?

08:09.811 --> 08:11.527
Okay.

08:11.553 --> 08:13.566
If it'll make you feel better.

08:17.808 --> 08:19.875
(saw buzzing)

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:30.749 --> 08:32.683
Hey. (grunts)

08:33.916 --> 08:35.717
(yells) (grunts)

08:35.784 --> 08:37.451
(siren blaring)

08:37.519 --> 08:41.587
(howling)

08:44.957 --> 08:46.657
Come on, we're almost done.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.759
You said you'd help me finish my list.

08:48.827 --> 08:50.461
Yeah, but grave-robbing is a crime.

08:50.529 --> 08:51.963
Dennis and I had an agreement

08:52.031 --> 08:53.531
before he died of alcohol poisoning.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.034
I can have his bones as long
as I promise not to use them

08:56.102 --> 08:58.838
as a Flintstones-style xylophone.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.474
I know. Like I'm not gonna do that.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.478
He shouldn't have put that idea in my head.

09:02.546 --> 09:03.646
Hey, Ryan.

09:03.713 --> 09:06.045
Jenna, hi.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.848
Uh, what-what are you doing home so early?

09:07.916 --> 09:09.383
Uh, some idiot called a bomb threat

09:09.450 --> 09:11.530
into the station, so they sent us all home.

09:11.553 --> 09:12.793
Bomb threat?

09:12.854 --> 09:14.320
Yeah, that was me. I e-mailed it in.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.887
A bomb threat was on my bucket list.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.890
- So, what are you up to? 
- Oh, uh,

09:17.958 --> 09:20.660
we're just going for a long walk.

09:20.729 --> 09:22.163
You think Wilfred can handle that?

09:22.231 --> 09:24.265
A fake walk?
Yeah, I think I can handle that.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.998
Oh, yeah, he'll-he'll be fine.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.867
Sounds like fun. Can I join you?

09:28.935 --> 09:31.905
Uh... yeah, sure.

09:31.973 --> 09:35.006
Um, how's she gonna come on a fake walk?

09:35.074 --> 09:38.743
Do you think Wilfred's okay?

09:38.810 --> 09:40.913
Maybe he could use a rest.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.747
Just give me a chance to cool off.

09:43.815 --> 09:46.750
(panting)

09:46.817 --> 09:48.954
Oh, great.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.123
Now I need a sweater.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.189
How have you been? I mean...

09:55.257 --> 09:57.259
you know, with your dad.
