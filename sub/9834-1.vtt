You're Watching on 123Movies.to

01:05.090 --> 01:06.817
Jeff, give me a two-shot.

01:07.757 --> 01:09.314
Here's a bulletin from Washington.

01:09.392 --> 01:12.117
I just feel as if everything
is out of my control.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.418
I've got an animal head right there.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.218
Do you know what did it?

01:20.624 --> 01:23.318
We say it's the only way to look terrific.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.720
- He understands all about the gifts.
...recent string of fatal attacks.

01:30.993 --> 01:33.352
This next one coming up is in the park.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.981
It's the second victim.

01:43.824 --> 01:45.051
She's ours.

01:48.093 --> 01:51.148
Now with this film out,
the public is dying to see her.

01:53.023 --> 01:54.512
It's for real.

02:01.426 --> 02:04.758
... Dr. George Waggner explains
on a special edition of Perspective.

02:04.827 --> 02:05.882
You can take it out.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.683
We saw pictures
just like we saw in his room.

02:16.993 --> 02:19.651
It is, after all, what we are.

02:19.725 --> 02:21.783
... TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.

02:21.860 --> 02:22.985
Repression.

02:23.626 --> 02:26.953
Repression is the father of neurosis...

02:27.524 --> 02:28.820
of self-hatred.

02:30.124 --> 02:33.886
Stress results
when we fight against our impulses.

02:34.924 --> 02:39.051
We've all heard people talk about
animal magnetism...

02:39.393 --> 02:41.052
the natural man...

02:42.326 --> 02:43.915
the noble savage...

02:44.558 --> 02:46.818
as if we'd lost something valuable...

02:47.190 --> 02:49.817
in our long evolution
into civilized human beings.

02:49.892 --> 02:51.882
There's a good reason for this.

02:52.559 --> 02:54.186
Man is a combination...

02:54.627 --> 02:59.184
of the learned and the instinctual,
of the sophisticated and the primitive.

03:00.061 --> 03:03.389
We should never try to deny the beast...

03:03.759 --> 03:05.282
the animal within us.

03:05.793 --> 03:09.420
- The minute anything breaks, cut to Chris.
- Before Doc pitches his book?

03:09.493 --> 03:13.516
Hell, he's been coaching Karen on
how to talk to this psycho. He won't mind.

03:20.791 --> 03:21.780
How much?

03:25.794 --> 03:27.691
How much for a half and half?

03:27.992 --> 03:29.687
Sorry, but excuse me.

03:31.060 --> 03:32.321
Excuse me.

03:34.262 --> 03:37.058
- You're that TV lady, ain't you?
- Yeah, buzz off.

03:38.893 --> 03:39.948
Jesus.

03:41.224 --> 03:42.953
- Did Karen see this?
- Yeah.

03:43.025 --> 03:44.288
Oh, shit.

03:45.561 --> 03:48.049
She never even mentioned
seeing the victims.

03:48.129 --> 03:50.027
She didn't want you to worry.

03:53.661 --> 03:54.819
I'm worried.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.124
Okay, guys, this is the jackpot.

04:08.662 --> 04:12.027
I'm on Western between...

04:13.527 --> 04:15.754
I'll transmit as soon as Eddie calls.

04:15.827 --> 04:19.057
- I don't like the interference.
- It's the best rig we got.

04:19.428 --> 04:22.825
No, it's all that neon out there.
It messes up the signal.

04:23.327 --> 04:25.352
I'll get our people to cruise Western.

04:26.063 --> 04:29.225
Boy, there's a lot of
flotsam and jetsam out tonight, ain't there?

04:29.497 --> 04:32.359
Seems like there's more of them
every time I get out here.

04:33.559 --> 04:37.118
I wonder where they come from,
where they're going to.

04:37.494 --> 04:40.984
I don't know where they're from,
but they got to where they're going.

04:41.064 --> 04:43.054
... six, David Jail, 1455.

04:43.129 --> 04:45.963
Contact lost with Fox 1.
Vicinity: Western and DeLongpre.

04:46.032 --> 04:48.822
Report any sighting.
Repeat, report any sighting.

04:51.529 --> 04:55.792
She's wearing a purple and lavender outfit.
We'll be able to spot her pretty easy.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.054
Yeah, I've seen her on the news.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.723
"Weeks ago,
when Update News reporter Karen White...

05:01.796 --> 05:06.458
"began receiving calls from a mysterious
stranger, identifying himself only as Eddie...

05:06.533 --> 05:08.790
"the KDHB News team..." No.

05:10.729 --> 05:13.489
"The KDHB News team began working...

05:13.895 --> 05:16.862
"The KDHB News team
began working with local police...

05:16.930 --> 05:19.521
"to link Eddie with a recent string of..."

05:21.998 --> 05:23.022
Hi, Bill.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.624
That's a brave li'I ol' girl you've got there.

05:42.962 --> 05:46.760
"Tonight, in an act of courage,
we here at KDHB...

05:46.830 --> 05:48.661
"are all very proud of..."

05:49.132 --> 05:50.359
Good evening.

05:50.932 --> 05:53.423
- Terry, how are you?
- Good. How's it going?

05:54.132 --> 05:55.791
I'll need a few more minutes.

06:01.129 --> 06:04.029
Jesus, there's a guy standing
right outside the booth now.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.495
I don't know if it's him or not.

06:05.564 --> 06:08.154
Lieutenant Shantz, Detective Kline...

06:08.830 --> 06:10.490
this is Karen's husband.

06:10.564 --> 06:13.292
You've got quite a brave young lady there,
Mr. White.

06:13.365 --> 06:16.527
Neill, Bill Neill.
My wife uses her maiden name.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.427
Bill Neill. Stanford, right?

06:20.364 --> 06:21.886
So how is it going?

06:21.998 --> 06:25.293
I have not got a clean word from Karen
in the last 15 minutes.

06:25.364 --> 06:26.490
15 minutes?

06:32.569 --> 06:33.556
Hello.

06:33.669 --> 06:35.495
Hold it. She's transmitting.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.329
Come on, Eddie. I know that it's you.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.398
Yeah, I'm alone.

06:44.367 --> 06:46.560
Are you wearing what I asked you to?

06:49.568 --> 06:50.555
Good.

06:56.398 --> 06:57.797
Where's the sound?

07:00.168 --> 07:01.495
- That's it.
- What?

07:01.564 --> 07:03.587
I'm afraid we might've lost her.

07:05.966 --> 07:06.955
Lost her?

07:07.134 --> 07:10.031
What the hell kind of
half-assed operation is this?

07:11.269 --> 07:14.628
Okay, Eddie, I'll be there
in just a little while.

07:20.567 --> 07:22.465
Okay, mister, it's all yours.

07:30.699 --> 07:34.428
You said you'd never be out of contact.
What kind of operation are you running?

07:34.501 --> 07:37.955
- They have people in the area...
- What does that mean, "in the area"?

07:38.034 --> 07:39.468
They will find her!

08:02.603 --> 08:05.998
Okay, guys, this is it.
I'll keep the transmitter open.

09:30.705 --> 09:33.831
- Hello, Eddie.
- I knew you'd come, Karen.

09:35.034 --> 09:37.558
We have a lot to talk about, you and me.

09:44.937 --> 09:48.098
- Can I turn around and see you?
- Not yet, Karen.

09:49.871 --> 09:50.997
Just watch.

09:53.504 --> 09:56.593
- Yeah, she asked me directions to it.
- How long ago?

09:56.669 --> 09:58.157
A couple of minutes.

09:58.871 --> 10:01.428
The struggle between mind and body...

10:01.838 --> 10:04.169
is not a necessary one.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.200
It produces anger, frustration,
the strain of modern-day living...

10:08.273 --> 10:11.237
in a world that is moving too quickly.

10:12.304 --> 10:14.099
Three minutes to commercial.

10:14.171 --> 10:16.264
Two, push in to a single on the doctor.

10:16.339 --> 10:19.430
All of us have a great
untapped potential for living.

10:20.941 --> 10:22.598
Waiting is tough.

10:23.173 --> 10:26.436
... depends as much on our attitudes
toward our physical lives...

10:26.508 --> 10:28.269
Ready 1. Take 1.

10:28.341 --> 10:31.633
... as it does on the social programming
of our minds.

10:34.239 --> 10:37.636
When we are born, each of us is given a gift.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.469
The gift of life.

10:42.139 --> 10:43.572
Camera 2, give me a two-shot.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.937
She didn't feel a thing, Karen.
None of them do.

10:48.904 --> 10:51.370
They're not real, the people here.
They're dead.

10:51.439 --> 10:53.269
They could never be like me.

10:55.007 --> 10:56.939
But you're different, Karen.

10:57.207 --> 10:58.571
I watch you on TV.

10:59.841 --> 11:02.568
And I know how good I can make you feel.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.634
I'm going to light up your whole body.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.168
Turn around now, Karen.

11:22.906 --> 11:24.803
I want to give you something.

11:35.841 --> 11:39.468
There's a broad that came in here.
She emptied the place out.

11:39.643 --> 11:41.231
She's watching movies.

11:47.108 --> 11:48.095
Please!

11:58.472 --> 12:00.406
My God, Jesus Christ!

12:01.774 --> 12:04.334
Put your piece away!

12:07.844 --> 12:10.637
I knew I shouldn't have let
that broad back here.

12:11.109 --> 12:12.737
Go to remote. Take it.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.737
A reign of urban terror ended early tonight...

12:21.807 --> 12:23.965
in a bizarre shoot-out
at a Western Avenue...

12:24.040 --> 12:26.938
No knife, no gun, no nothing.
The freak was clean.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.734
What happened back there?

12:28.808 --> 12:31.331
Don't ask me, Lieutenant.
Ask Quick Draw McGraw.

12:31.775 --> 12:35.500
... died in an attempted assault
of KDHB anchorwoman Karen White...

12:35.574 --> 12:37.539
who'd been receiving calls from him...

12:37.607 --> 12:41.267
in connection with the recent series
of brutal murders in the downtown area.

12:41.341 --> 12:43.103
It's me. Are you all right?

12:51.008 --> 12:53.597
It's okay. We can go home in a few minutes.

12:53.674 --> 12:56.505
I talked the old man
out of putting you on camera tonight.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.803
That was big of you.

12:57.876 --> 13:00.899
We'll tape something later on,
when you feel up to it.

13:03.642 --> 13:05.006
I don't know...

13:06.710 --> 13:09.610
Whatever happened, in your own words.
Nothing newsy.

13:10.007 --> 13:12.199
I don't know what happened in there.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.101
I don't remember.

14:15.310 --> 14:17.539
Please, don't do it!

14:21.410 --> 14:23.536
It's me, Bill. It's all right.

14:25.742 --> 14:27.300
I didn't even see him.

14:27.377 --> 14:30.468
I turned around, but I didn't see him.

14:53.979 --> 14:56.708
- It's Number 27, down the hall.
- Thank you.

14:57.977 --> 14:59.908
Did the guy say anything else?

15:00.212 --> 15:04.608
He just said he worked with a kid
named Eddie, that he thought lived here.

15:04.777 --> 15:07.972
- He did say the kid hated washing dishes.
- Who doesn't?

15:09.179 --> 15:10.303
Here we go.

15:21.611 --> 15:22.635
Charming.

15:30.649 --> 15:31.634
Oh, God.

15:36.278 --> 15:39.372
It's just your average, red-blooded,
all-American boy.

15:50.114 --> 15:51.475
Get out of here!

15:56.247 --> 15:58.836
Boy, Doc's gonna have a field day
with these.

16:00.845 --> 16:02.038
Karen.

16:02.781 --> 16:04.007
Look at this.

16:05.681 --> 16:08.444
Not bad. The kid had talent.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.936
He could've designed
the Marquis de Sade coloring book.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.439
I think we better call the cops.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.039
Eventually.

16:39.816 --> 16:41.044
Look at this.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.138
I wonder if this is a real place.

16:49.448 --> 16:52.277
So what's the story
on our next Norman Rockwell?

16:52.646 --> 16:56.637
This sort of person is controlled
by the right hemisphere of the brain.

16:58.749 --> 17:01.147
That dominates the non-rational...

17:01.482 --> 17:03.675
the artistic, the creative impulses.

17:05.446 --> 17:08.846
It's not unusual
for a killer to draw as well as that.

17:09.448 --> 17:12.643
It's not a bad angle, Doc.
Do you mind putting that on tape for us?

17:12.715 --> 17:13.807
Not at all.

17:13.915 --> 17:18.008
We're pushing Fred for a half-hour special
called The Mind of Eddie Quist...

17:18.083 --> 17:20.944
although we're focusing, really,
on the beast in all of us.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.138
Good idea.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.044
- So you found the last name?
- He signed his work.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.842
So he did.

17:34.584 --> 17:36.448
I'm sorry.

17:38.715 --> 17:41.306
I guess I'm just not quite ready yet, okay?

17:42.382 --> 17:43.678
You'll be okay.

17:44.583 --> 17:45.740
Don't worry.

17:58.415 --> 18:00.041
Stand by, Cameras 1 and 2.

18:00.115 --> 18:03.139
- Then I'm on the air.
- 2, push on in.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.009
Are you sure you're up to this?

18:06.084 --> 18:09.676
- Nothing like diving in head first.
- That's what the old man says.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.250
Here's our girl.

18:13.419 --> 18:17.577
We're gonna make ratings history tonight.
You'll be the cynosure of all eyes.

18:17.650 --> 18:20.173
That means everybody
is going to be watching you.

18:20.251 --> 18:23.548
Everybody wants to see
the lady who caught Eddie the Mangler.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.708
Terrific. You have my copy?

18:26.484 --> 18:27.576
Good luck.

18:28.253 --> 18:30.742
- Boy, she seems shaky.
- Looks fine to me.

18:31.053 --> 18:34.573
- We go in 10 seconds.
- Don't let this be the last stop for your car.

18:34.649 --> 18:39.415
- Keep your runabout running right...
- Five, four, three...

18:39.781 --> 18:42.748
This is KDHB TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.

18:42.816 --> 18:43.907
Up on 2.

18:45.882 --> 18:48.975
It's the 5:00 edition
of the Southland's top-rated newscast...

18:49.050 --> 18:52.241
the Channel 6 Update News,
featuring Lew Landers and Karen White...

18:52.314 --> 18:55.405
with the late-breaking headlines,
Gene Codler with sports...

18:55.481 --> 18:56.743
John Rob with the weather...

18:56.816 --> 18:58.180
Ready, Camera 2.

18:59.849 --> 19:02.317
Are the tapes on that train wreck ready?

19:03.851 --> 19:07.678
... 14 injured in train derailment.
More on the Mideast earthquake.

19:11.582 --> 19:14.914
Karen White's exclusive eyewitness account
of the police shooting...

19:14.985 --> 19:17.952
of the key suspect
in the Eddie-the-Mangler slayings.

19:18.651 --> 19:20.479
Now, here's Karen White.

19:22.585 --> 19:23.812
Good evening.

19:45.716 --> 19:47.239
Get her out of there.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.784
- Roll 7.
- Cue the editorial.

19:52.419 --> 19:56.011
... proclaimed no immediate danger
to nearby residential areas.

19:58.087 --> 20:02.516
Let's pause now for an editorial
from our General Manager, Fred W. Francis.

20:03.084 --> 20:04.243
Here's Fred.

20:05.518 --> 20:08.576
In keeping with this station's pledge
of community involvement...

20:08.653 --> 20:12.313
we present an editorial
from KDHB station manager, Fred Francis.

20:13.787 --> 20:17.811
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. You need a little more time.

20:19.021 --> 20:23.073
There's been a lot of talk in the past month
about our culture of violence.

20:23.518 --> 20:24.950
Who knows? Maybe she's pregnant.

20:25.018 --> 20:28.642
Get in touch with Fujiama, Fujimoto,
or whatever the hell her name is...

20:28.718 --> 20:31.083
and get her ready for the 11:00 report.

20:32.018 --> 20:33.781
Now there is a pro.

20:37.786 --> 20:39.716
You can't be afraid of dreams.

20:41.351 --> 20:43.613
I can't help it. All I remember...

20:44.619 --> 20:46.346
is pushing open the door...

20:48.521 --> 20:50.419
and then I'm outside...

20:50.855 --> 20:55.216
and the police are there, Bill's there,
and the remote crew, and it's over.

20:59.452 --> 21:03.217
There's blood on me, and I can't imagine
who it might have came from.

21:03.621 --> 21:06.950
You can't remember
anything that happened inside the booth?

21:08.454 --> 21:10.444
No, not really.

21:11.257 --> 21:13.547
Just weird little pieces in my dreams.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.173
How're you and Bill?

21:19.053 --> 21:20.609
Trying to communicate.

21:23.654 --> 21:27.418
- Tell me, Doctor, how crazy am I?
- Completely bananas.

21:28.422 --> 21:29.445
I think so.

21:29.522 --> 21:33.007
I recommend that you go out to the Colony
for a week or two.

21:33.853 --> 21:36.375
- Your place up north there?
- That's right.

21:36.452 --> 21:39.249
I only recommend it
to very special patients...

21:39.320 --> 21:41.879
ones who I think will benefit
from its environment.

21:41.954 --> 21:44.478
It's a place where you can
recharge your batteries.

21:44.557 --> 21:47.919
It'll enable you to try and get back
to what you really are.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.217
What goes on up there?

21:50.287 --> 21:54.187
Seminars, group therapy. It's very low-key.

21:54.588 --> 21:57.714
It'll be a good place
to try and tackle this amnesia thing.

21:59.524 --> 22:01.682
I don't know if I want to remember.

22:02.556 --> 22:03.544
What?

22:04.824 --> 22:08.684
Doc said, once I remembered what
happened, it wouldn't scare me anymore.

22:08.753 --> 22:10.117
I'm not so sure.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.315
Honey, give this place a chance, okay?

22:14.086 --> 22:15.713
We've got to do something.

22:17.054 --> 22:19.317
I hope these people aren't too weird.

22:35.456 --> 22:37.116
Jerry Warren, softwares.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.685
Bill Neill, hardware.

22:39.925 --> 22:40.911
Hardware?

22:41.090 --> 22:42.485
He doesn't get it, Bill.

22:42.555 --> 22:46.044
I own a couple of health clubs, barbells,
hardware. This is my wife Karen.

22:46.122 --> 22:47.985
Hi, nice to meet you.

22:48.055 --> 22:50.682
- Prime rib?
- No, I try to stay away from meat.

22:50.758 --> 22:52.985
- Maybe later. Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:54.023 --> 22:55.546
Did you see that meat?

22:57.591 --> 23:00.485
Oh, my God!
We watch you on the news all the time.

23:01.220 --> 23:02.846
You're our second favorite...

23:02.921 --> 23:06.357
right behind...
What's the name of that Oriental girl, Jerry?

23:06.424 --> 23:08.252
This is my wife, Donna.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.411
- Get me out of here, Bill.
- Looky here!

23:13.491 --> 23:15.218
Welcome to the Colony!

23:15.625 --> 23:18.987
Charlie Barton, Bill and Karen...

23:19.056 --> 23:21.020
- White.
- Neill.

23:21.088 --> 23:25.022
Charlie's on our board. He put up
all the cattle for tonight's barbecue.

23:25.357 --> 23:27.585
I seen you on television!

23:28.124 --> 23:29.215
Thank you.

23:30.925 --> 23:33.619
If you fellows don't mind,
I'm going to borrow Karen...

23:33.692 --> 23:35.987
and give her the run-down on the Colony.

23:36.056 --> 23:38.248
- Don't leave out the juicy stuff.
- I won't.

23:38.323 --> 23:39.550
Come on.

23:40.158 --> 23:43.250
- Let's get this boy some bacon.
- You say when now, Bill.

24:06.857 --> 24:08.451
Can't go on like this.

24:09.859 --> 24:11.348
Damn teeth are shot.

24:11.791 --> 24:13.087
Hell of a note.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.855
You want some?

24:25.528 --> 24:27.016
Sure, why not?

24:28.326 --> 24:29.553
What's in it?

24:33.526 --> 24:34.616
It's good.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.214
I'm Bill.

24:37.927 --> 24:38.950
I know.

24:41.427 --> 24:43.416
I'm looking for my wife.

24:47.430 --> 24:48.448
Why?

24:54.194 --> 24:55.282
Excuse me.

25:02.995 --> 25:05.721
...opening up and letting it all come out.

25:05.793 --> 25:08.519
I've found parts of me
I didn't even know existed.

25:08.590 --> 25:12.117
Now you can see why I brought you here.
You won't be cold here.

25:12.693 --> 25:16.751
- Speaking of cold, how is your bungalow?
- It's quite nice, thanks.

25:16.828 --> 25:19.056
- We're neighbors.
- You are?

25:20.430 --> 25:24.051
Tell me something else.
Do you miss the television?

25:24.726 --> 25:27.454
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

25:35.758 --> 25:37.952
Hello, Marsha. How are you?

25:38.326 --> 25:41.617
Take this book back.
I don't want my brother reading it.

25:42.523 --> 25:44.455
I think he said he'd like to.

25:45.024 --> 25:47.149
You've done enough damage already.

25:56.759 --> 25:58.692
- Bitch.
- No.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.778
We can all learn a great deal from Marsha.

26:02.323 --> 26:04.254
She's a very elemental person.

26:04.823 --> 26:06.723
It's all that natural energy.

26:07.425 --> 26:08.948
She's a nymphomaniac.

26:11.860 --> 26:15.223
It's just that it's so unchanneled.

26:16.626 --> 26:18.352
She has a long way to go.

27:18.062 --> 27:20.494
Let me go! I want to end it!

27:20.562 --> 27:22.187
Easy, buddy, just calm down.

27:22.261 --> 27:25.023
This is the only way.
I got to end it, I got to burn!

27:25.096 --> 27:27.459
Calm down. Think a minute.

27:28.197 --> 27:30.283
You got to let me do it, Doc.

27:30.892 --> 27:33.256
- Jesus.
- Don't worry.

27:34.361 --> 27:38.292
That's one of Erle's favorite tricks.
He's just trying to get attention.

27:38.460 --> 27:41.724
I want to end it. It just goes on and on.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.590
You know better than that.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.752
The old man shouldn't drink.
It really gets him loose.

27:48.127 --> 27:50.387
Believe me, come tomorrow...

27:50.592 --> 27:53.822
people will be so pleased
to see that you're safe and sound...

27:53.895 --> 27:55.917
they won't think anything more of it.

27:55.994 --> 27:57.859
You get a good night's sleep.

27:58.063 --> 28:00.791
Everything will seem better
in the light of day.

28:01.030 --> 28:03.222
There, now.

29:15.867 --> 29:18.123
Bill, wake up, there's something out there!

29:18.195 --> 29:20.185
Outside. Something was howling.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.189
- Listen.
- The wind.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.491
There was something howling before.

29:30.998 --> 29:32.794
Okay, sure. Somebody's dog.

29:33.632 --> 29:35.652
Not like any dog I ever heard.

29:36.261 --> 29:37.750
Honey, you were raised in L.A.

29:37.830 --> 29:40.160
The wildest thing you ever heard
was Wolfman Jack.

29:40.230 --> 29:41.719
This is the country.

29:41.797 --> 29:44.423
Come on, let's try to get some sleep, okay?

29:46.698 --> 29:47.688
Good.

31:26.300 --> 31:29.732
You heard something outside.
Why shouldn't you call the police?

31:31.299 --> 31:34.163
I'm embarrassed.
I wish we hadn't even called them.

31:34.232 --> 31:37.562
Look at this!
All the balls on my side of the court again.

31:38.132 --> 31:40.756
What you ladies need is a good retriever.

31:43.999 --> 31:47.932
Doc said on the phone that you folks
had a coyote problem out here.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.956
- You're famous, ain't you?
- Sort of.

31:51.065 --> 31:54.124
Sam, this is Karen White.
Karen, Sam Newfield.

31:54.202 --> 31:57.561
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I used to watch you all the time.

31:57.963 --> 32:00.520
You're prettier than Walter Cronkite.

32:00.598 --> 32:04.427
Karen thought she saw something moving
in the bushes last night.

32:05.031 --> 32:09.431
Coyotes is liable to come into a setup
like this to look for garbage.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.795
- Did you hear anything?
- Me?

32:12.700 --> 32:14.327
I sleep like the dead.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.531
Tattoo? I don't remember one on him
when he came in.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.193
The coroner...

32:20.466 --> 32:22.988
The coroner said
that he had one on his shoulder.

32:23.065 --> 32:25.625
Some kind of animal head, right there.

32:26.935 --> 32:29.458
I don't get many of you TV people in here.

32:29.534 --> 32:33.293
Mostly it's the newspaper guys
who like to come in, look at the meat.

32:33.499 --> 32:35.623
I don't know how you can stand it.

32:35.933 --> 32:38.490
Doesn't bother me.
Want to unwrap him, Ross?

32:38.567 --> 32:43.400
Let's see, Quist is still with the John Does.
We haven't had time to re-file him.

32:43.802 --> 32:46.426
Only thing that freaked me out
since working here...

32:46.501 --> 32:48.298
is the night old Stu Walker came in.

32:48.368 --> 32:52.228
The guy who worked here.
I say goodnight to him at the shift change...

32:52.298 --> 32:56.062
a couple hours go by, then we get a delivery
from the Oceanside unit.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.596
I unzip the bag.

32:57.764 --> 33:01.721
There's old Stu, smiling up at me,
leaking sea water out his ears.

33:02.867 --> 33:04.231
Visitors, Eddie!

33:06.335 --> 33:07.495
Where is he?

33:08.335 --> 33:10.061
He was here this morning.

33:10.832 --> 33:12.423
God! Look at the door.

33:13.765 --> 33:16.326
You don't suppose somebody
could have stolen him, do you?

33:16.401 --> 33:18.866
He didn't get up and walk out on his own.

33:26.734 --> 33:28.428
There're cows around here?

33:28.967 --> 33:32.730
Charlie Barton's got a couple of acres
of pasture just down the hill.

33:35.503 --> 33:37.128
They don't sound right.

33:38.435 --> 33:41.334
I'm not really sure
how cows are supposed to sound.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.060
Not like that.

33:49.335 --> 33:51.356
Jerry's got a rifle, doesn't he?

33:52.968 --> 33:55.729
Haven't you done assertiveness training?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.129
Before I hooked into Doc, I did it all.

34:00.803 --> 34:04.199
I did EST, TM, Scientology...

34:04.269 --> 34:06.631
iridology, primal screamers.

34:07.469 --> 34:10.869
I don't know. I figure
another five years of real hard work...

34:10.935 --> 34:12.958
and maybe I'll be a human being.

34:15.204 --> 34:16.694
I don't see nothing.

34:18.070 --> 34:20.429
I didn't hear anything so funny anyway.

34:22.534 --> 34:24.659
- Oh, Jesus!
- Christ!

34:28.471 --> 34:30.166
- Now what?
- What's wrong?

34:30.772 --> 34:32.735
- Great!
- What's wrong?

34:33.137 --> 34:36.128
- What's wrong?
- Let me look at it. Let me see.

34:37.905 --> 34:40.264
Here. I can tell about batteries.

34:42.402 --> 34:46.994
God, Donna. Now we're stuck out here
in the middle of Timbuktu someplace!

34:48.936 --> 34:50.665
- Watch that gun.
- God!

34:50.737 --> 34:53.569
Sorry to scare you, ma'am.
I thought you was a cowjacker.

34:53.637 --> 34:56.500
There's another one back up yonder,
tore up the same way.

34:56.570 --> 35:00.093
- You know what did it?
- It ain't a coyote, that's a cinch.

35:00.335 --> 35:01.666
You girls all right?

35:02.836 --> 35:05.303
Nothing like a quiet week in the country.

35:08.405 --> 35:09.895
A little straighter.

35:10.973 --> 35:13.700
All right, now the quick shot again.
Think fast.

35:15.603 --> 35:17.330
You have potential, Bill.

35:18.205 --> 35:20.569
I think you're ready for your bullets.

35:21.339 --> 35:23.999
Don't you guys usually use a dog
in this kind of hunt?

35:24.074 --> 35:26.936
Usually. But these clowns
would shoot all of them.

35:27.673 --> 35:29.832
Besides, who needs dogs? We got T.C.

35:31.507 --> 35:33.297
That boy's part bloodhound.

35:33.670 --> 35:37.728
I still think it was UFOs,
them cattle mutilations.

35:37.804 --> 35:41.930
Good, Erle. You watch the skies for us now.
That'll be your job.

35:42.004 --> 35:45.129
- I want to talk to you.
- I thought you had a session.

35:45.205 --> 35:48.730
I do. But I don't want you to go do this,
not just for my sake.

35:48.805 --> 35:50.168
Are you kidding?

35:52.171 --> 35:56.365
- I've never been on a wolf hunt before.
- This is a wolf hunt, not a coot show.

35:56.771 --> 35:59.102
The boys are calling me.
Do you see the boys?

36:10.000 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:33.939 --> 36:35.667
What happened then, Karen?

36:36.340 --> 36:37.930
I hear something else.

36:38.372 --> 36:41.203
Somebody else is breathing,
he's in there with me.

36:42.042 --> 36:45.005
It's Eddie, and he closes the door.

36:45.506 --> 36:47.665
And he puts a quarter into the slot.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.139
And the movie starts.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.634
And then he whispers something to me.

36:58.110 --> 37:00.972
He whispers something to me,
and then he tells me...

37:01.472 --> 37:03.962
I can finally turn around and look at him.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.606
Turn around, Karen.

37:06.107 --> 37:07.472
What do you see?

37:08.907 --> 37:10.397
What's there, Karen?

37:11.043 --> 37:13.667
- What do you see?
- What's there?

37:14.174 --> 37:17.040
- I can't see him.
- Just try. He's right there.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.196
- What do you see?
- What's there?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.404
I can't see him! I can't.

37:26.474 --> 37:28.667
Okay. That's far enough for now.

37:31.408 --> 37:32.499
I'm sorry.

37:43.407 --> 37:44.998
I got him. First shot.

37:47.041 --> 37:49.065
And he said he wasn't no hunter.

38:11.144 --> 38:12.441
We get 'em all:

38:13.272 --> 38:16.296
sun worshippers,
moon worshippers, Satanists.

38:16.608 --> 38:19.370
The Manson people
used to hang around here and shoplift.

38:19.442 --> 38:20.633
Bunch of deadbeats.

38:20.707 --> 38:23.868
Do you know of any groups
that are into stealing corpses?

38:23.940 --> 38:25.237
Body snatching?

38:25.809 --> 38:29.139
If you want to read about it, I've got a book.
Slide me down.

38:31.741 --> 38:32.728
Hold it.

38:34.173 --> 38:36.298
You name it, I've got the book.

38:36.875 --> 38:39.843
"A number of young women
were killed in the next month...

38:39.909 --> 38:42.932
"their bodies exhibiting signs
of animal attack."

38:43.443 --> 38:44.604
What's that?

38:45.712 --> 38:47.766
Warlocks, Werewolves and Demons.

38:54.909 --> 38:59.275
If you're going to purchase, purchase.
If not, leave them. You'll get them greasy.

38:59.544 --> 39:02.408
We'll find out if any of Eddie's killings
were on a full moon.

39:02.478 --> 39:04.409
That's a lot of Hollywood baloney.

39:04.478 --> 39:07.929
Your classic werewolf can change shape
any time it wants, day or night.

39:08.008 --> 39:11.407
That's why they're called shape-shifters.
I've got a dozen books on it.

39:11.475 --> 39:15.033
- What about killing it with silver bullets?
- Sure, silver bullets or fire.

39:15.107 --> 39:18.598
It's the only way to get rid of them.
They're worse than cockroaches.

39:18.675 --> 39:21.337
They come back from the dead
if you don't kill them right.

39:21.411 --> 39:22.742
Plus, they regenerate.

39:22.811 --> 39:25.503
Cut off an arm or leg,
stick a knife in the heart. Nothing.

39:25.575 --> 39:28.405
They look dead,
but three days later, they're as good as new.

39:28.474 --> 39:31.237
- Do you believe in this?
- What am I, an idiot?

39:31.309 --> 39:33.639
I'm making a buck here.
You want books, I got books.

39:33.710 --> 39:36.803
I got chicken blood, I got dog embryos,
black candles, wolfsbane.

39:36.879 --> 39:39.071
Look at this, silver bullets.

39:39.212 --> 39:42.110
Some joker ordered them.
.30-06. Never picked them up.

39:43.142 --> 39:45.473
I take BankAmericard,
American Express, Visa.

39:45.542 --> 39:48.170
- You gonna buy that or what?
- Yeah, these two.

39:49.545 --> 39:52.842
- There's some incredible old pictures here.
- That's a good book.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.671
Did you see any wolves?

39:58.980 --> 40:00.908
Nope. Just lots of rabbits.

40:01.576 --> 40:04.167
- What do you do with these things?
- Eat 'em.

40:05.678 --> 40:08.404
My sister will cook it up for you, if you want.

40:08.711 --> 40:10.802
No, I try to stay away from meat.

40:11.177 --> 40:12.701
Your wife might like it.

40:12.779 --> 40:15.678
You kill something you don't eat.
Now, that's a sin.

40:16.913 --> 40:18.898
I never thought of it like that.

40:18.977 --> 40:20.965
Our place is just over there.

40:21.042 --> 40:23.667
My sister would be glad
to cook it up for you.

40:25.611 --> 40:26.839
Are you sure?

40:27.079 --> 40:28.840
Marsha just loves to cook.

40:38.911 --> 40:40.138
Are you sure?

41:07.414 --> 41:09.004
How long will it take?

41:13.613 --> 41:15.076
I'll cook it later.

43:02.614 --> 43:05.638
It happened so fast
that I didn't even see what it was.

43:05.715 --> 43:09.275
- Jesus, Doc, is that necessary?
- Can't take any chances.

43:10.884 --> 43:11.872
God!

43:13.719 --> 43:15.114
I want to go home.

43:15.984 --> 43:18.471
I wouldn't advise traveling right now.

43:18.883 --> 43:21.248
A bite like that can be pretty serious.

43:24.914 --> 43:28.902
- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.
- That's just a legend though, isn't it?

43:28.980 --> 43:31.879
Yes, but like most legends,
it must have some basis in fact.

43:31.949 --> 43:35.843
Probably an ancient explanation
of the dual personality in each of us.

43:36.178 --> 43:37.474
How does it go?

43:38.612 --> 43:41.578
"Even a man pure in heart
and says his prayers by night...

43:41.646 --> 43:44.634
"may become a wolf
when the wolfsbane blooms...

43:44.745 --> 43:46.770
"and the autumn moon is bright."

43:47.215 --> 43:49.112
You're reading. I'll get it.

43:50.115 --> 43:53.511
- Who's calling at 11:30?
- It's my phone, I'll get it.

43:54.115 --> 43:55.272
I'll get it.

43:55.345 --> 43:57.937
- You want me to get it?
- You get it!

44:04.516 --> 44:05.982
No, we're still up.

44:06.816 --> 44:07.805
What?

44:09.281 --> 44:12.939
You're kidding me.
No, listen, we'll come right up, okay?

44:13.848 --> 44:15.974
We'll be right up. Just calm down.

44:16.682 --> 44:18.239
Okay. Bye-bye.

44:18.748 --> 44:19.874
What is it?

44:21.117 --> 44:23.104
Bill just got bitten by a wolf.

44:24.449 --> 44:27.315
... whoever is bitten
by a werewolf and lives...

44:27.550 --> 44:29.444
becomes a werewolf himself.

44:30.546 --> 44:32.775
Come on, Terry, it's only a movie.

44:33.448 --> 44:37.311
You go on ahead and I'll be up as soon as
I pitch the special to the old man.

44:37.380 --> 44:40.347
Relax, will you?
It was probably just some stray dog.

44:41.049 --> 44:42.913
- Hello, good friend.
- Hello.

44:42.983 --> 44:44.245
How are you?

44:44.317 --> 44:45.544
Are you okay?

44:47.181 --> 44:51.703
I don't know what her last name is.
Donna calls her Marsha the Man-Eater.

44:52.714 --> 44:55.512
And she lives in this shack...

44:55.882 --> 44:58.713
with these furry little animals
hanging from the rafters.

44:58.884 --> 45:01.817
You think she's trying
to make the move on Bill?

45:02.019 --> 45:04.571
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

45:05.481 --> 45:07.209
I sound paranoid, don't I?

45:10.083 --> 45:11.947
Karen, you sound fine.

45:12.884 --> 45:17.340
God, no veggies.
I totally forgot about Bill and his dinner.

45:17.418 --> 45:22.347
Bill, I'm really sorry.
I totally forgot about you not eating meat.

45:22.747 --> 45:24.975
No sweat. It's terrific.

45:25.048 --> 45:28.313
No, really. I get hungry enough,
I'll eat anything.

45:49.985 --> 45:51.882
Give me this book here.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.849
I just thought maybe we'd...

45:58.116 --> 46:00.139
Your timing is incredible.

46:02.184 --> 46:04.514
Sorry, honey. Those shots are...

46:10.085 --> 46:12.176
We're just out of sync, aren't we?

46:12.420 --> 46:15.147
We never want the same thing
at the same time.

46:20.817 --> 46:22.443
Goodnight, Bill.

46:42.319 --> 46:45.377
Turn around, Karen.

46:48.321 --> 46:50.285
What do you see?

46:51.353 --> 46:53.145
Can you see anything?

46:55.818 --> 46:57.285
Bill, it's...

47:01.621 --> 47:03.211
Screw you, then.

52:17.291 --> 52:18.450
Jesus.

53:41.462 --> 53:43.121
Over here, Terry.

55:45.700 --> 55:46.859
Hello?

55:49.731 --> 55:51.195
Anybody here?

58:35.900 --> 58:37.126
Oh, God!

58:56.196 --> 58:57.426
Oh, God!

59:30.567 --> 59:31.625
No!

01:00:46.402 --> 01:00:48.198
Come on, Christopher.

01:00:53.903 --> 01:00:56.890
Christopher, you're not
going to believe this.

01:01:05.272 --> 01:01:07.033
I'm in the bathroom.

01:01:09.971 --> 01:01:11.867
I had that dream again.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:14.801
This time I think you were in it.

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:17.862
No wonder, honey.
You've been asleep all day.

01:01:17.937 --> 01:01:21.372
Jesus, where did you get
those scratches on your back?

01:01:23.337 --> 01:01:26.896
I guess they're from the other night,
when I got attacked.

01:01:27.072 --> 01:01:29.591
They weren't there the other night.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.396
Karen, you're really getting paranoid.

01:01:36.434 --> 01:01:40.427
- You've been with her, that Marsha girl?
- Don't lay your fantasies out on me.

01:01:40.504 --> 01:01:43.994
- I'm not gonna take that...
- I know, it's all a big conspiracy...

01:01:44.072 --> 01:01:49.000
You don't have one inch of backbone!
She walks by you like a bitch in heat...

01:01:53.637 --> 01:01:55.194
Don't touch me.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.959
I'm going over to Doc's and call Chris.

01:02:08.037 --> 01:02:11.869
He'll come pick Terry and me up.
You can do whatever you want.

01:02:12.273 --> 01:02:15.726
- You don't know what it's like.
- I don't want to know.

01:02:22.635 --> 01:02:24.569
... and Eddie Quist, he lives...

01:02:24.638 --> 01:02:28.365
Calm down. You're not making any sense.
Eddie Quist is dead.

01:02:28.739 --> 01:02:31.669
I saw pictures just like we saw in his room.

01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:34.595
Christopher, the landscape...

01:02:35.706 --> 01:02:37.673
it's here at the Colony.

01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:40.268
It's real.

01:02:41.305 --> 01:02:43.668
- Where are you, at Doc's?
- Yeah.

01:02:45.171 --> 01:02:47.764
Christopher, I'll tell you something.

01:02:48.672 --> 01:02:51.300
I think he's got to be a part of this.

01:02:52.573 --> 01:02:55.370
Is there some kind of file cabinet there?

01:02:57.674 --> 01:02:59.933
Are you sure you're all right?

01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:02.569
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.829
It sure is good to hear your voice.

01:03:06.774 --> 01:03:09.103
Look in the files under "Quist."

01:03:10.907 --> 01:03:12.805
You won't hang up, will you?

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:17.099
I'll get the police there as soon as I can.
Just go look in the file.

01:03:17.604 --> 01:03:20.767
Okay, hold on.
Never mind, you're coming with me.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:35.064
"Quist, Marsha."

01:03:37.372 --> 01:03:38.963
"Quist, T. C."

01:03:44.207 --> 01:03:46.673
It's Eddie Quist.

01:04:14.506 --> 01:04:17.802
Operator, get me
the County Sheriff's Department, quick!

01:04:37.008 --> 01:04:38.668
No, don't bother.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:43.507
I'll get hold of the state boys
and we'll meet you over at the center.

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:46.869
I wouldn't worry, Mr. Halloran.
I'm sure she's safe.

01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:45.141
Those are real silver. I got to check
with a jeweler to find out what to charge!

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.437
Bill me.

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:48.774
Crazy fuck.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.573
I got to use your phone.

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:08.366
Jesus Christ, what happened in here?

01:07:14.344 --> 01:07:16.140
- Hello, Karen.
- Eddie.

01:07:18.212 --> 01:07:19.874
I'm glad you came.

01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:22.537
I wanted to see you again.

01:07:25.146 --> 01:07:26.632
I saw you die.

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:34.137
You said on the phone
that you wanted to get to know me.

01:07:34.714 --> 01:07:36.340
Here I am, Karen.

01:07:37.216 --> 01:07:38.577
Look at me.

01:07:42.114 --> 01:07:44.769
I want to give you a piece of my mind.

01:07:46.111 --> 01:07:47.908
I trusted you, Karen.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:16.109
Take it easy, pal.
Not all of us got enough money for a Mazda.

01:11:16.185 --> 01:11:18.345
Some of us have to work for a living.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.746
I'm in a hurry here. This is an emergency!

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:30.812
Come on out of there now, miss.
We've been waiting for you.

01:11:49.085 --> 01:11:51.348
Took some persuading, did she?

01:13:01.554 --> 01:13:03.020
Where's Bill?

01:13:03.722 --> 01:13:05.189
He's one of us now.

01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:08.685
In time, he would have brought you
over to us. Our secret will be safe.

01:13:08.753 --> 01:13:10.616
It's wonderful, Karen.

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:13.377
When I was first bitten, I fought against it.

01:13:13.451 --> 01:13:16.510
So did Jerry. And then we found the doctor.

01:13:16.887 --> 01:13:19.649
He helped us. He helped us to adjust.

01:13:19.821 --> 01:13:23.017
You see, Karen,
he understands all about the gift.

01:13:24.023 --> 01:13:27.179
He knows how to use it, how to control it.

01:13:27.552 --> 01:13:31.008
You'd have Bill back.
There's still time if you accept the gift.

01:13:31.087 --> 01:13:33.348
It was a mistake to bring her to the Colony.

01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:35.786
We should have stuck with the old ways.

01:13:35.855 --> 01:13:39.085
Raising cattle for our feed.
Where's the life in that?

01:13:39.158 --> 01:13:42.745
- Humans are our cattle.
- Humans are our prey.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.916
We should feed on them,
like we've always done.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:48.920
Screw all this "Channel your energies" crap.

01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:51.315
But the danger of exposure...

01:13:52.424 --> 01:13:56.550
We need this shelter to plan,
to catch up with society.

01:13:57.289 --> 01:14:01.013
Times have changed and we haven't.
Not enough.

01:14:01.086 --> 01:14:02.552
Shut up, Doc!

01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:09.181
You wouldn't listen to me. None of you.

01:14:12.256 --> 01:14:14.280
"We can fit in," you said.

01:14:15.157 --> 01:14:17.056
"We can live with them."

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:20.045
You make me sick.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.450
You're through, Doc.

01:14:23.355 --> 01:14:24.877
She's ours now.

01:14:43.059 --> 01:14:46.887
See what your friend did to me that night?

01:14:47.457 --> 01:14:51.653
What's the matter with you all? Have you
forgotten everything you've learned?

01:14:51.724 --> 01:14:53.845
She can't disappear. She's well-known.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.581
Right, we've got to make this
look like an accident.

01:14:56.657 --> 01:14:58.453
I won't let you do this.

01:15:05.257 --> 01:15:09.316
You can't tame what's meant to be wild.
It ain't natural.

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:16.917
Violence is part of the human condition,
as history shows us.

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:21.556
Coping with that fact,
living with it, presents each of us...

01:15:23.592 --> 01:15:28.151
Fortunately, most of us are able
to deal constructively with those choices.

01:15:28.592 --> 01:15:31.682
But for others, the animal lure of mayhem...

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:35.248
the physical sensation
of life-and-death struggle...

01:15:35.324 --> 01:15:37.224
produces gratification.

01:15:37.293 --> 01:15:40.453
According to the autopsy reports,
Eddie's victims were bitten...

01:15:40.524 --> 01:15:43.390
almost as if
they had been attacked by an animal.

01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:45.823
Doctor, what can you tell me
about lycanthropy?

01:15:45.893 --> 01:15:48.117
Where did you learn that term?

01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:51.351
- On the Late Late Show.
- It's a mental disorder.

01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:55.617
There are dozens of cases.
People like to walk about on all fours...

01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:59.852
to make bestial groans and sighs.
They prefer to eat raw meat.

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:02.887
That certainly seems like
an awfully big coincidence...

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.685
Karen being attacked by someone
with this kind of delusion.

01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:19.592
You're not going to believe this.

01:16:20.428 --> 01:16:22.221
I've been attacked...

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.753
Hello, brave boy.

01:16:31.994 --> 01:16:33.188
Eddie?

01:16:34.327 --> 01:16:37.418
You know me, and I don't know you.

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:40.225
- Now why is that?
- Where is she?

01:16:40.895 --> 01:16:42.982
Why? Is she your girlfriend?

01:16:43.859 --> 01:16:45.382
Where's Terry?

01:16:46.192 --> 01:16:49.181
Just down at the ritual center,
down the path.

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.548
That's where Waggner sends us to...

01:16:53.393 --> 01:16:55.461
unwind.

01:16:55.592 --> 01:16:58.787
- He's so repressed.
- What did you do to her?

01:17:00.592 --> 01:17:02.523
She's got a sexy voice.

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.789
I like a woman with a sexy voice.

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:12.017
Listen to this part here.

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.550
You are crazy.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:18.882
I'm much more than that, bright boy.

01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:20.613
I'm much more.

01:17:22.492 --> 01:17:23.584
Here.

01:17:24.493 --> 01:17:25.722
Take it.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.984
Call it a gift.

01:17:33.528 --> 01:17:35.285
Come on, bright boy.

01:17:38.959 --> 01:17:40.926
Don't you know anything?

01:17:57.625 --> 01:17:59.524
Put her and her friend in the car...

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:04.220
pour gasoline over them, set fire to them,
and push them off the Coast Road.

01:18:08.295 --> 01:18:10.485
Chris, run! They'll kill you!

01:18:10.792 --> 01:18:13.487
That gun won't do you any good, mister.

01:18:17.495 --> 01:18:19.359
Don't come any closer.

01:18:59.163 --> 01:19:00.993
I have silver bullets in here.

01:19:01.064 --> 01:19:03.621
Silver bullets, my ass.

01:19:04.594 --> 01:19:05.958
Get up, T.C.

01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:18.329
They're real.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.092
Don't come any closer, Doc, please.

01:19:36.831 --> 01:19:38.161
Thank God!

01:19:52.631 --> 01:19:54.395
Karen, get the door!

01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:58.717
Take the rifle.

01:20:07.131 --> 01:20:08.359
Come on!

01:20:10.832 --> 01:20:14.288
- Is that the only door in the barn?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:20:16.528 --> 01:20:19.018
- Where's Terry?
- They killed her.

01:20:19.329 --> 01:20:20.955
And I think Bill.

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:22.897
Take this.

01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:32.153
Get it started!

01:21:51.335 --> 01:21:54.768
- How'd you find out about them?
- Terry called, right after...

01:21:54.836 --> 01:21:56.664
Stop, it's Sam.

01:22:05.765 --> 01:22:06.856
Duck!

01:22:25.433 --> 01:22:27.227
I smell gas. Come on.

01:22:36.071 --> 01:22:37.558
Give it to me.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.228
Come on!

01:22:52.002 --> 01:22:53.492
Lock the door!

01:23:19.865 --> 01:23:20.890
Go!

01:23:50.766 --> 01:23:53.028
We have to warn people, Chris.

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:55.528
We have to make them believe.

01:24:07.905 --> 01:24:10.525
There! I'm an artist. You look terrific!

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.162
I know you are. Thanks.

01:24:13.734 --> 01:24:16.224
If you're done, Fran, thanks a lot.

01:24:26.567 --> 01:24:29.660
- I'm not sure I can go through with this.
- You have to.

01:24:29.735 --> 01:24:31.792
Okay, stand by on the set.

01:24:31.969 --> 01:24:35.335
Five, four, three, two...

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:37.460
Good evening.

01:24:37.536 --> 01:24:41.129
More word on that fire that's burning
out of control up the coast tonight.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:45.190
Firefighters have discovered the blaze
seems to have started at the Colony...

01:24:45.268 --> 01:24:47.132
an experimental living community...

01:24:47.203 --> 01:24:50.397
founded by author and behavior expert,
Dr. George Waggner.

01:24:50.469 --> 01:24:51.764
She's ready.

01:24:51.835 --> 01:24:54.428
How does she look?
Does she look all right to you?

01:24:54.502 --> 01:24:57.335
Reports so far indicate
that bodies have been discovered...

01:24:57.405 --> 01:24:59.836
both inside and outside
the Colony buildings...

01:24:59.904 --> 01:25:02.390
many of them burned beyond recognition...

01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:06.594
in what authorities on the scene are calling
a Guyana-like spectacle.

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:10.762
Now for an exclusive eyewitness report
on the incident, we welcome back...

01:25:10.837 --> 01:25:14.636
If she shows any sign of freezing,
like the last time, go right to commercial.

01:25:14.706 --> 01:25:15.965
Take one.

01:25:17.474 --> 01:25:18.937
Good evening.

01:25:21.436 --> 01:25:23.494
From the day we're born...

01:25:23.605 --> 01:25:25.401
there is a battle we must fight.

01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:29.303
A struggle between
what is kind and peaceful in our natures...

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.964
and what is cruel and violent.

01:25:32.038 --> 01:25:33.937
What the hell is this, an editorial?

01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:36.369
That choice is our birthright
as human beings...

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.096
and the real gift
that differentiates us from the animals.

01:25:41.036 --> 01:25:43.401
It is as natural to us as the air we breathe...

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:46.594
Did you pass this material?
She's not reading from the prompter.

01:25:46.671 --> 01:25:48.604
We changed it a little bit.

01:25:48.736 --> 01:25:50.760
But now, for some of us...

01:25:51.238 --> 01:25:53.603
that choice has been taken away.

01:25:54.407 --> 01:25:56.462
A secret society exists...

01:25:57.272 --> 01:25:59.497
and is living among all of us.

01:26:01.604 --> 01:26:04.332
They are neither people nor animals...

01:26:04.406 --> 01:26:06.769
but something in between.

01:26:07.406 --> 01:26:10.306
Monstrous mutations,
whose violent natures...

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:13.134
- Ready one, take one.
...must be satisfied.

01:26:13.771 --> 01:26:17.567
I know what you're thinking,
because I've been where you are...

01:26:17.638 --> 01:26:19.572
- That's enough.
- Leave it.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.469
- Leave it? Cut!
- Leave it!

01:26:21.539 --> 01:26:23.234
But I have proof...

01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:27.737
and tonight I'm going to
show you something...

01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:31.004
to make you believe.

01:26:42.206 --> 01:26:44.071
Holy shit!

01:26:53.105 --> 01:26:54.571
What is this?

01:26:55.005 --> 01:26:59.200
- What are you kids watching?
- The news lady's turned into a werewolf.

01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:01.269
Oh, boy!

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.807
Switch, damn it!

01:27:31.806 --> 01:27:33.534
Doesn't that look good?

01:27:33.607 --> 01:27:37.473
Tender, meaty chunks
of tantalizing nutrition...

01:27:37.542 --> 01:27:40.202
Things they do with special effects
these days!

01:27:40.275 --> 01:27:42.742
Did you see the one
about the guy in the spaceship?

01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:44.103
It was real.

01:27:44.174 --> 01:27:47.161
She turned into a werewolf,
and they shot her.

01:27:48.542 --> 01:27:50.167
You're plastered!

01:27:50.908 --> 01:27:52.568
Doesn't mean it wasn't real.

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:57.007
Ernie, put a pepper steak on for me,
and a hamburger for the lady.

01:27:57.077 --> 01:28:00.168
- How do you want that?
- How do you want it, honey?

01:28:03.775 --> 01:28:04.864
Rare.

01:30:30.846 --> 01:30:32.142
Go now...

01:30:32.913 --> 01:30:34.674
and heaven help you.
