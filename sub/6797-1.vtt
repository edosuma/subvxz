01:42.157 --> 01:45.151
Come here. Come here now.

01:47.097 --> 01:49.463
You're the last one.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.195
I've killed all the others.

01:52.235 --> 01:55.736
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

01:55.739 --> 01:57.468
Why are you doing this?

01:57.469 --> 02:01.132
You need to be punished
for what you did to him.

02:01.133 --> 02:04.296
- I didn't do anything.
- You let him drown.

02:04.681 --> 02:09.276
- Jason was my son.
- I didn't do anything.

02:10.925 --> 02:13.960
No. No. No. Please.

02:13.991 --> 02:16.856
You should have been watching him.

02:18.795 --> 02:20.854
Every minute.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.100
Jason.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.940
My special, special boy.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.743
They must be punished, Jason,
for what they did to you.

03:14.744 --> 03:17.035
For what they did to me.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.350
Kill for Mother.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.555
I'm serious.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.642
You gotta watch out for
mountain lions. They're all over.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.478
- Mountain lions?
- We'll be fine. They're afraid of fire.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.730
Dude, shut the fuck up.
I'm calling bullshit.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.232
Richie's gonna call bullshit.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.359
- Bullshit!
- Richie's calling bullshit.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.110
- I'm not bullshitting.
- Bullshit.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.321
You'll see when a mountain
lion comes out...

03:58.322 --> 04:00.323
- Dude, there's one right there!
- Nice try.

04:01.951 --> 04:04.410
I am more afraid to be
eaten by mosquitoes.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.247
Hey, you wanna slap that ass
one more time for Daddy?

04:07.248 --> 04:10.400
- Did Daddy like that?
- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.003
Whitney? Where are you right now?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.713
- I'm here.
- Are you?

04:15.714 --> 04:18.950
I'm here. Right in the
middle of nowhere.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.429
- Hey, are you reading that right?
- I'm reading it right.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.932
- Come on, Pizarro, let's go.
- Where are we going?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.710
- These are heavy and it's hot.
- Where are we?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.943
Dude, we are way the fuck off.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.444
- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.781
No, we're not. Not everything
shows up on GPS, Richie.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.534
A sign said there was a mine
here. Did that come up?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.577
No. We're close, I think.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.330
You think? Dude, you don't
know how to use this thing.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.499
It's almost dark. Do
you know where it is?

04:51.500 --> 04:54.294
Look, I didn't plant
this shit, Richie, okay?

04:54.295 --> 04:57.380
I got this tip from a secondhand
source. We should be close.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.507
Look, we're gonna stop here.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.261
Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get
up at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

05:03.262 --> 05:06.347
We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.516
- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.977
- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.855
There's a perfect spot here.
It's already been cleared.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.858
Perfect. We'll camp here.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.570
Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?

05:20.571 --> 05:24.574
- A lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.326
- I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.286
- You know what rich people do?
- What?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.872
They relax. You need
to fucking relax.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.984
- I need to relax?
- You need to relax.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.287
Hey, guys. Guys.

05:45.929 --> 05:50.516
I just found some broken-down cabins
over there. It's gotta be the old camp.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.435
Who wants to go check it out?

05:52.436 --> 05:54.729
Is this all we brought
to drink? No Heineken?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.105
Fuck that Euro shit.

05:56.106 --> 06:00.109
This is Pabst Blue American
Ribbon, my friend.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.847
You do realize this camp was
closed down, like, 20 years ago?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.449
Some woman, she went fucking nuts.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.201
Killed all these counselors.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.787
Blamed them for her son's
drowning. He was like...

06:10.788 --> 06:13.498
deformed or retarded or something.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.525
Really?

06:15.918 --> 06:18.153
Mom got hers.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.755
Apparently there was one survivor.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.632
This girl...

06:22.633 --> 06:25.968
she cut that lady's head
off with a machete.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.553
It gets weirder.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.472
I'm sure it does.

06:29.473 --> 06:33.543
Her son, Jason...

06:34.812 --> 06:37.047
he came back.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.384
He was actually there.

06:41.777 --> 06:45.388
He watched his mom being beheaded.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.991
A friend of mine, he went
to camp around here...

06:48.992 --> 06:51.035
- Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.288
He said the cops came. They were
looking for that Jason guy.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.233
All right, you know what?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.085
- Don't believe me.
- Nobody does.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.337
But I'm pretty sure, the
way the story goes...

07:01.338 --> 07:03.840
the place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.884
Do you know how many lakes are
probably called Crystal Lake?

07:06.885 --> 07:10.179
It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal
Water. Go to a supermarket.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.807
Every single bottle of water
is "Crystal" something.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.142
- Aquafina.
- The...

07:14.143 --> 07:15.601
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.856
The story could have happened anywhere.
It's how they get kids to shit themselves.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.650
- How's that beer, beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.487
You can drink that, by the way. Yours,
hers, mine. I swear, piss is sterile.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.282
- You will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.351
What about me?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.981
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.208
I got marshmallow on my knee.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.085
- Where you guys going?
- Go make out.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.545
Oh, yeah?

07:42.546 --> 07:44.088
- Hey, Mikey?
- Sweet.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.574
Wear a condom.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.119
An extra small one.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.472
I get it, dude. You do what
you gotta do to survive.

07:52.473 --> 07:57.226
If we were all out here starving
to death and you were dead...

07:57.227 --> 07:58.644
I'd eat your leg.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.063
- That's really sweet. Yeah.
- Thank you.

08:01.064 --> 08:05.468
Why would you eat my leg, man? I can
teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.320
I don't eat fish.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.113
That's not what you told me.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.191
Listen...

08:20.334 --> 08:23.211
I don't think I'm gonna
stay the whole time.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.379
Did Wade's story scare you?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.424
Please.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.410
I just...

08:31.595 --> 08:34.205
I don't feel right being here...

08:34.264 --> 08:36.390
so far away from my mom.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.311
Your mom was the one that told me to
get you out of town for a few days.

08:40.312 --> 08:43.214
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.677
And she's in good hands. She's
got her nurse right there.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.155
Come on.

08:51.156 --> 08:56.186
Have sex with your boyfriend
in a cramped little tent.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.957
We can get hammered, blow
some chunks in the woods.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.777
Then we can go back Monday
and deal with whatever.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.825
Hey.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.681
I'm a fucking idiot.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.458
Richie?

09:19.309 --> 09:23.396
- The ephemeris data just didn't sync up.
- Oh, dude, that sucks.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.715
Fucking right.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.402
- Do you know what this means?
- I wanna...

09:29.403 --> 09:31.096
What?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.323
We're, like... We're,
like, a half mile away.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.894
- Less.
- Shut up.

09:38.704 --> 09:42.816
You know what makes me happy,
Richie? Global positioning systems.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.734
GPS to the layperson.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.044
NASA technology...

09:47.045 --> 09:49.964
in the palm of your hand. Know
what this little fucker does?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.841
This guy sends a signal
up into outer space.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.052
Signal.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.971
Satellite gets it, turns it around.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.417
It's like, "Oh, thank you, GPS.
I'm gonna send a signal to you."

10:00.434 --> 10:03.102
Back to the palm of your hand.
Technology, man.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.605
It is un-fucking-believable.

10:05.606 --> 10:09.843
Wade, you gotta bounce, dude.
Tell your dumb shit to somebody else.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.096
Why, because I'm fucking
teaching you something?

10:17.034 --> 10:20.244
Say, Richie, old buddy,
I'm gonna bounce.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.705
- You do that, brother. Okay.
- I'm spent.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.734
May the Force be
with your Schwartz.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.504
You're in so much trouble.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.956
Oh.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.089
Fuck, yes.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.645
I love you.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.940
And you. And you.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.999
I even love you.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.862
Oh, my God. Look at this shit.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.966
What the fuck? What the fuck?!

11:56.967 --> 11:59.468
What's this? No, no! No! No!

12:03.306 --> 12:06.543
That must be the camp that
Wade was talking about.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.315
- Let's check it out.
- No, I wanna go this way.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.443
Come on.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.637
Come on.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.486
Wow, look at that.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.343
Mike, where are you going?

12:41.344 --> 12:42.928
- Let's go inside.
- No.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.347
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Oh, come on.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.308
Come on. What are you scared of?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.377
No.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.972
I am willing to bet there's
some pretty cool shit in here.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.954
Mike, don't go in there. What if
some homeless person lives here?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.107
No homeless person lives here.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.446
You hungry?

13:28.934 --> 13:30.835
Wow.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.132
Look at how old this shit is.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.804
It's like it was dragged
here from another century.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.489
Check this out.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.598
Hey. It looks like you.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.495
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.399
It's cool, you should keep it.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.961
It's a little kid's room.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.057
Wasn't Jason the name
from Wade's story?

15:08.366 --> 15:09.575
- I wanna go.
- What?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.577
- Like, right now.
- Oh, come on.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.912
Please?

15:12.913 --> 15:16.165
- You like that?
- Yeah. Wait for me. Wait for me.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.459
- No, I think I'm gonna...
- Oh, no. Don't do that again.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.086
- We'll do it at the same time.
- Hang on.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.672
- I'm almost there.
- Shit. I heard something.

15:23.673 --> 15:27.368
Stop it. Wait, I'm serious.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.246
- What?
- I think Wade's watching us.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.306
What?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.751
Well, fuck it, let the perv watch.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.920
Right?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.631
Shit.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.900
Wade.

15:42.901 --> 15:47.096
Dude, if you're out there whacking
off, man, that is not cool.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.807
Come on, dude.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.994
I think we're good.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.371
- Don't come yet.
- No, no.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.122
- Tell me when you want to.
- Wait.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.792
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.781
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.285
Okay.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.501
Wade!

16:16.643 --> 16:19.295
I'm gonna kill you.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.069
Okay?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.612
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.140
No, go get him. Tell
him to leave us alone.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.454
I'm not gonna go out
there with a boner.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.400
Well, you're not getting
any until you do.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.946
- Go.
- Do not move, okay?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.307
Richie?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.361
Richie, stop fucking around.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.415
Wade.

17:37.432 --> 17:42.170
Dude, you jump out from a tree, I'm gonna
punch you in your face, I shit you not.

17:44.022 --> 17:48.176
Come on, man. I gotta get
back to the fucking tent.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.430
Holy shit.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.993
You fucking jerk,
you found the weed.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.578
Wade. Wade!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.759
Wade. Wade.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.561
Amanda!

18:49.963 --> 18:52.949
Amanda! Goddamn!

18:53.299 --> 18:55.117
Richie!

18:56.219 --> 18:58.079
Fuck!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.629
Richie!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.758
Oh, God!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.435
Cool.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.096
Whitney, you've gotta see this.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.599
Mike. Come on.

19:43.600 --> 19:47.920
No, I'm serious. You've gotta
see this. Somebody's been here.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.032
What is that?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.976
There's something in there.

20:02.327 --> 20:06.564
- Looks like some kind of a doll.
- Are you crazy?

20:13.630 --> 20:14.796
- Oh, my God! Ah!
- Ah!

20:20.136 --> 20:22.413
There's something out there.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.419
- Stay here.
- No.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.666
Ah! Oh, my God!

20:52.502 --> 20:54.070
Get away, get back!

20:54.629 --> 20:56.072
Get off the floor!

20:56.256 --> 20:58.006
Holy fuck!

20:58.007 --> 21:00.326
- Ah!
- Mike!

21:02.136 --> 21:06.374
- Mike. Mike, get up. Come on.
- Go!

21:29.289 --> 21:30.731
Help me!

21:32.208 --> 21:34.902
- Mike! Mike!
- Run.

21:35.545 --> 21:38.280
Run! Run, Whitney!

22:01.404 --> 22:03.055
Oh, my God.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.558
Oh, God.

22:20.882 --> 22:24.452
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:28.598 --> 22:32.184
Whitney! Whitney, help.
Whitney, please. Help!

22:32.185 --> 22:33.753
Whitney! Whitney.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.172
Whitney!

22:41.944 --> 22:44.013
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.433
Shit.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.105
Come on. Shit.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.487
Oh, God. No. Come on.

23:41.462 --> 23:45.533
Oh, my God. Babies have
more space in the uterus.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.455
Hey, Lawrence, how
about a little help?

23:51.973 --> 23:57.002
Dude, you're gonna ask the one black
guy to pump the gas for you? Shit.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.521
Okay. Nolan.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.715
How about I pay, you pump?

24:01.899 --> 24:04.734
Sure, man. Hey, I give
a wicked blow job too.

24:04.735 --> 24:08.430
Okay, well, um, we'll
try that out later.

24:11.868 --> 24:16.605
Whoa. Hey, bro, that's... I have a
heart murmur. What are you doing?

24:20.001 --> 24:22.502
- Thank you.
- Where'd you get a knapsack like that?

24:22.503 --> 24:25.881
It was a present, actually.
But I'm looking for my sister.

24:25.882 --> 24:28.617
She's gone missing, about
a month and a half ago.

24:29.552 --> 24:33.221
My parent's cabin is stocked. You
think you're actually gonna get laid?

24:33.222 --> 24:35.724
Your parents do not
have Combos or Funyuns.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.393
They definitely don't
have Fritos. And this is...

24:38.394 --> 24:39.728
not for sex.

24:39.729 --> 24:43.299
- What are you gonna use them for?
- It's an experiment.

24:43.774 --> 24:47.068
Okay. So just get behind me. I'm
not gonna pay for that shit.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.530
Would you mind if I maybe just put a
flyer in the window or something?

24:50.531 --> 24:53.601
Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.

24:53.868 --> 24:57.329
If it was up to me, you could wallpaper
the whole place with them...

24:57.330 --> 24:59.498
but the owner makes the rules.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.082
And he's a real:

25:04.545 --> 25:05.712
Um...

25:05.713 --> 25:10.091
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.
Maybe if he understands the situation...

25:10.092 --> 25:11.593
Are you gonna buy something?

25:11.594 --> 25:15.748
I mean, you've been up here for
quite a while yapping, So...

25:16.974 --> 25:18.683
Sure. Yeah.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.338
Thanks. So we have two
waters and some gas.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.606
Two waters and some gas.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.759
Guess I'm an asshole.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.696
You okay, bro? Is everything good?

25:31.697 --> 25:33.615
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.684
But I'm not your bro.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.620
So you don't wanna be friends?
You don't wanna hang out?

25:38.621 --> 25:41.690
- Let it go, Trent.
- It's not me. This guy's being a dick.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.818
Yeah, it's me. Obviously,
I'm the one being a dick.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.128
Sir, thank you very much anyways.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.240
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.035
Thank you.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.128
Seat belts.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.089
Welcome back, Clay.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.191
You mean that, Officer Bracke?

26:50.192 --> 26:52.694
Son, I know you think
we're not on your side...

26:52.695 --> 26:56.432
that we're just a bunch of
dumb country hicks out here.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.577
I put two 10-year
veterans on that case.

27:00.578 --> 27:05.081
We did three dozen interviews and ran
a county-wide search for your sister.

27:05.082 --> 27:08.168
You know how many thousands of
people disappear every year...

27:08.169 --> 27:10.696
even in this state alone?

27:11.088 --> 27:14.090
But there's no evidence that
anything happened to Whitney...

27:14.091 --> 27:19.538
or any of those other kids at Crystal
Lake. There's no car, no witnesses.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.082
Nothing.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.962
One of those kids was
her boyfriend, right?

27:27.563 --> 27:28.964
Right.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.924
Well...

27:31.359 --> 27:34.178
they probably just
took off together.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.781
Our mother just died of cancer.
Did I tell you that?

27:37.782 --> 27:40.934
- No, sir.
- Well, she did.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.162
She was sick for a long time...

27:44.163 --> 27:48.400
and Whitney took care of
her every single day.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.321
And then my sister didn't
show up for the funeral.

27:54.465 --> 27:58.118
See, you just don't know my
sister. That's not possible.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.745
Well...

27:59.762 --> 28:02.164
she's not here, son.

28:02.765 --> 28:07.419
Might wanna try looking someplace else.
That's what the other families are doing.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.703
- Can you say that with a...?
- Wow.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.871
Can you say that with
a little more hatred?

28:26.872 --> 28:29.191
- Nice.
- Shit.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.630
Sir Lancelot, thank you.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.799
- Oh, man down.
- Take it easy, guys.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.135
Is anyone getting a
signal out here?

28:40.136 --> 28:43.430
Are you fucking with me? I got
business I gotta do this weekend.

28:43.431 --> 28:44.848
What business?

28:44.849 --> 28:46.975
Music. I'm trying to start a label.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.545
Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?

28:50.855 --> 28:53.006
Why you gotta go racial?

28:53.023 --> 28:55.650
Look, don't put me
in a box, all right?

28:55.651 --> 28:58.653
What, because I'm black I
can't listen to Green Day?

28:58.654 --> 29:01.489
You're right, that was dumb.
So, what kind of music?

29:01.490 --> 29:02.891
Rap.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.692
Here it is.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.543
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.838
All right, we have two bedrooms
upstairs. We've got one down.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.174
Someone can take the couch.
It's comfy as hell.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.676
- Wow.
- Nice, huh?

29:21.677 --> 29:24.012
- Damn.
- That is a fierce pussy.

29:24.013 --> 29:26.181
It's a bobcat. It's
my dad's first kill.

29:26.182 --> 29:29.434
I didn't think this long-ass car
ride was gonna be worth it...

29:29.435 --> 29:31.352
but it's kind of worth it.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.021
This is bigger than the dorm.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.300
What can I say? Hey, take your
feet off the table, please.

29:38.486 --> 29:41.237
So make yourselves at home.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.785
- What do you wanna do first?
- What do you wanna do?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.021
Oh, well...

29:49.663 --> 29:53.859
I brought Sweet Lucille. I think
you all need to meet her.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.674
Lucille? Baby, is that you?

30:01.675 --> 30:03.718
- Lawrence, you've been cheating.
- No.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.221
- I saw you with a bowl the other night.
- No, you...

30:06.222 --> 30:08.040
A bowl.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.977
Hello?

30:30.079 --> 30:32.147
Hello?

30:38.045 --> 30:39.488
Hello?

30:41.257 --> 30:42.866
Hello?

30:58.107 --> 31:00.050
Christ.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.772
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- Hush.

31:14.456 --> 31:18.610
I wanted to ask you if maybe
you've seen somebody.

31:18.961 --> 31:20.988
My sister.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.465
She came camping up around
here with some friends...

31:24.466 --> 31:26.868
and she's gone missing.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.956
She ain't missing. She's dead.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.851
- What?
- People go missing around here...

31:34.852 --> 31:36.878
they're gone for good.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.564
Outsiders come, they don't
know where to walk.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.149
They bring trouble.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.984
We just wanna be left alone.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.178
And so does he.

31:45.446 --> 31:47.180
So does who?

31:50.492 --> 31:53.228
Ma'am, please. So does who?

32:02.338 --> 32:06.199
- You, baby. It's all you.
- Stop peer-pressuring me.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.350
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

32:15.351 --> 32:18.186
- Yes!
- My fucking eye!

32:18.187 --> 32:22.982
Guys, watch the floor, all right,
please? That's stained oak.

32:22.983 --> 32:27.220
- This is an outside game. Come on.
- Wait, I got foam in my contact.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.562
Hey. This is a great spot.

32:35.746 --> 32:38.456
Do you wanna go for a hike?
Get some exercise?

32:38.457 --> 32:42.903
That'd be nice, but, well, I can't
exactly leave them here alone.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.905
What are you talking about?

32:46.882 --> 32:49.534
Have you seen what
they're doing inside?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.970
Crazy. Some drunken hoodlums.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.305
- Hoodlums?
- Hoodlums.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.641
What do you think they're gonna do?

32:56.642 --> 32:59.936
- I mean, steal the deer head?
- You're right.

32:59.937 --> 33:03.606
How are they gonna pull off the getaway?
We're leaving in the same car.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.525
Come on. Do you want some exercise?

33:05.526 --> 33:08.778
Because I have this really great
move that I've been practicing...

33:08.779 --> 33:11.280
and I need someone
to practice it with.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.409
Very charming. Very charming.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.478
Oh, come on.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.455
- You wanna go on a hike?
- You like hikes now?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.541
- I love hikes.
- I knew it.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.777
Will you get me a beer?

33:55.325 --> 33:57.436
Excuse me.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.609
Sir?

34:06.211 --> 34:07.779
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Jesus.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.326
Sorry.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.121
Jesus Christ.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.973
You're fucking lucky
there, stretch.

34:18.974 --> 34:23.335
Came that close to hitting the start
button on the whoop-ass machine, boy.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.149
Look, I didn't mean to startle you.
I was trying to get your attention.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.568
This is Mr. Garikes' property.

34:30.569 --> 34:34.572
You're lucky that old mummy fart
didn't put buckshots in your ass.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.809
Somebody's been stealing
his fucking kerosene too.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.661
Look, I just came in here
to ask you something, okay?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.246
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?

34:43.248 --> 34:45.525
She's been missing
for about a month.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.527
I wish I had, man.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.547
- I ain't seen her, though.
- Thanks.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.408
- Take care.
- You too.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.385
Shit. Hey, hey, hey.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.472
I forgot, did you
wanna buy some weed?

34:59.473 --> 35:03.851
Seriously, I found a fucking shit ton of
it growing out there. A little bushel.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.354
- Sell you some.
- No. Thanks.

35:06.355 --> 35:09.023
- You sure? I got a whole bunch of it.
- I'm good.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.274
You sure?

35:10.275 --> 35:12.527
It's your fucking loss, dude.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.446
It'll fuck your shit up, boy.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.906
Good times...

35:16.907 --> 35:18.324
fucker.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.536
Just relax, okay? These
guys are your guests.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.647
If you're...

35:23.914 --> 35:28.318
If you're not comfortable having them
here, then why did you invite them?

35:28.710 --> 35:31.087
So they could admire your place?

35:31.088 --> 35:34.616
No. I just wanted to have
a good weekend. You know?

35:35.092 --> 35:38.745
Hey, guys. Wanna check out the
other side of the lake with us?

35:40.389 --> 35:43.683
Um... You know what?
It's getting, you know...

35:43.684 --> 35:47.895
No. That's okay. It's... It's okay.
It's getting kind of late.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.105
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.632
Take my truck.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.234
- Nice.
- I trust you.

35:53.235 --> 35:56.279
Can you do me a favor? Will you
take the gas cans to the boat?

35:56.280 --> 35:59.866
It's on the south end of the lake.
Just take a right onto Town Road.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.576
- Take a right.
- Okay, and then?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.995
Why don't you just type
"boat" into the nav?

36:03.996 --> 36:05.580
- Technology, right?
- See you.

36:05.581 --> 36:08.900
- Have fun.
- Later.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.753
Don't drive my boat.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.298
I'm the only one that
drives the boat, okay?

36:15.299 --> 36:16.966
Aye, aye, captain.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.618
Damn straight.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.474
What does that say about me
that the second Trent said...

36:25.475 --> 36:28.561
"Don't take my boat out," it
was guaranteed that I would.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.438
It means you're a sociopath.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.967
Now, what does it say about
me that I find that hot?

36:39.364 --> 36:43.184
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm looking for my sister and...

36:44.161 --> 36:46.062
Hey.

36:47.206 --> 36:51.026
- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.086
- May I?
- Yeah.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.922
- Thank you.
- Sure.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.866
She's pretty.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.037
Thanks.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.222
Do you wanna come in for
a second, grab a drink?

37:04.223 --> 37:06.166
Uh...

37:06.600 --> 37:09.769
I don't think your boyfriend
would like that too much.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.687
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

37:11.688 --> 37:16.051
And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.845
Thanks.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.560
This should be interesting.

37:27.663 --> 37:30.565
Hey, Trent, you remember...

37:31.500 --> 37:32.942
Clay.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.004
Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.657
Why is he in my house?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.634
Hey, new guy. Beer?

37:41.635 --> 37:46.514
No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?

37:46.515 --> 37:48.416
Yeah.

37:48.517 --> 37:49.892
Right.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.687
- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.

37:52.688 --> 37:57.066
Look, Clay, obviously she's
just trying to be nice.

37:57.067 --> 38:00.569
But you can't stay here. No offense,
but this is a private party.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.989
- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.199
That's so funny, I just said that.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.618
Like two seconds ago,
that I don't know you.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.289
I would probably leave soon before
I get pissed off and, you know...

38:11.290 --> 38:13.666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.042
What happens then?

38:15.043 --> 38:18.947
Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.715
Yeah.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.702
Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.102
Sorry about that.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.105
That's all right. It's
his house, you know?

38:36.106 --> 38:37.523
Where's your car?

38:37.524 --> 38:40.192
I do not have a car,
but I do have her.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.445
- Nice.
- Thanks.

38:42.446 --> 38:46.324
- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.576
So where you off to next?

38:48.577 --> 38:52.788
I haven't been to the other side of the
lake, so I was gonna go check that out.

38:52.789 --> 38:56.151
- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.352
It's a big motherfucker, huh?

39:45.008 --> 39:46.534
Fuck, yeah.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.455
You hot bitch.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.045
Let Daddy have a little lick.

40:00.482 --> 40:04.844
You like that, bitch?
You know you do.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.351
What the fuck was that?

40:16.331 --> 40:19.901
Somebody better not be stealing
the kerosene up there.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.761
Shit.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.382
Gina.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.176
It's just you, baby.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.905
It's been a long time, Gina.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.699
You remember that
special night we had?

41:33.700 --> 41:36.076
You remember when you
took my virginity?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.478
You're sexy.

41:37.704 --> 41:42.150
You're still tight as ever. I'm
gonna fucking pound you so hard.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.444
What the fuck?

41:54.930 --> 41:56.096
What the...?

41:56.097 --> 41:59.167
That shit ain't fucking right,
dude. What the fuck?

42:47.023 --> 42:50.067
You think we should take the
boat out? He's gonna find out.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.819
- I knew it.
- What?

42:51.820 --> 42:56.156
You're inhibited. You talk a big game, but
inside you're just a scared little girl.

42:56.157 --> 42:59.201
Oh, really? Oh, okay, fine.

42:59.202 --> 43:02.329
You wanna find out who's
really scared? Let's do it.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.441
All right. Let's go.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.697
So you and your sister
must be pretty close.

43:11.006 --> 43:14.133
We were pretty close when we
were younger. We kind of drifted.

43:14.134 --> 43:17.662
I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.707
She kind of had to, I guess.

43:20.890 --> 43:24.335
I don't know, she's always
been the responsible one.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.589
So when's the last time
you talked to her?

43:29.190 --> 43:33.527
About six months ago. We
got in a fight, actually.

43:33.528 --> 43:37.698
She called and said she wanted to see
me, said she was counting on me...

43:37.699 --> 43:39.450
and I never showed.

43:39.451 --> 43:41.519
Excuse me.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.831
What is that?

43:45.832 --> 43:48.026
It's a GPS.

44:03.224 --> 44:05.752
- All right, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.

44:11.399 --> 44:13.092
Yeah. Oh, shit.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.324
Yeah.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.648
Yeah.

44:32.629 --> 44:34.004
Pick it, pick it.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.215
Oh, you like the balls
in your hand, huh?

44:36.216 --> 44:38.425
Which one? Which one is it?
Is that the one?

44:38.426 --> 44:40.928
- Those feel good, don't they?
- That's the one.

44:40.929 --> 44:42.663
Shoot.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.059
Fuck.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.796
One of you has gotta
shoot the boot.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.188
That's you, babe.

44:51.189 --> 44:52.606
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.359
You missed. I've been
carrying you the entire game.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.695
- Come on, baby.
- Drink up, drink up, drink up.

44:57.696 --> 45:02.282
<i>Shoot the boot, shoot the
boot, shoot the boot.</i>

45:02.283 --> 45:04.993
Shoot the boot.

45:04.994 --> 45:08.247
Fuck that. I'm not drinking out
of your sweaty-ass sneaker.

45:08.248 --> 45:10.124
You lost 10 in a row. Shoot.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.668
My house, my rules.
I'm not drinking that shit.

45:12.669 --> 45:14.670
- Fine.
- Oh, no.

45:14.671 --> 45:17.631
- To all the felching...
- No. No.

45:17.632 --> 45:19.216
- ...welching...
- Yes.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.869
pussies of the world.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.873
That's disgusting.

45:40.155 --> 45:42.640
Oh!

45:55.170 --> 45:57.071
Yeah.

46:04.512 --> 46:06.747
What are you doing, Nolan?!

46:15.815 --> 46:17.550
Nolan!

46:20.236 --> 46:24.223
Nolan. Oh, my God.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.188
Nolan.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.206
Oh, God. Oh, God.

46:32.207 --> 46:34.233
Nolan?

46:36.085 --> 46:39.030
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

46:47.722 --> 46:49.556
What do you want from me?

46:49.557 --> 46:51.308
Oh, my God.

48:13.808 --> 48:17.628
Let's just check out this last
cabin, then we'll head back.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.476
Come on.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.126
You really should call the police.

49:23.127 --> 49:26.171
I've already called. They're
not looking for her anymore.

49:26.172 --> 49:28.366
No one is, except for me.

49:28.383 --> 49:30.217
Then they should look
harder because...

49:30.218 --> 49:31.885
Oh! Ow.

49:31.886 --> 49:34.554
- You all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

49:34.555 --> 49:36.582
- You sure?
- Yeah.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.588
Let's get out of here.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.717
Watch your step.

49:57.161 --> 50:00.481
Give me a sec, I gotta
change out my batteries.

50:04.210 --> 50:07.613
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.251
Oh, my God.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.839
Where's he going?

51:55.279 --> 51:58.365
- Oh, my God. We gotta go.
- Shh.

51:58.366 --> 52:00.534
- I gotta follow him.
- He had a dead body.

52:00.535 --> 52:03.771
- We gotta go. We gotta warn my friends.
- Okay, okay.

52:37.905 --> 52:40.323
- You okay?
- Yeah.

52:40.324 --> 52:42.309
What is that?

52:44.954 --> 52:47.481
Help!

52:50.001 --> 52:51.209
Come on, let's go.

52:51.210 --> 52:52.752
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

52:52.753 --> 52:54.947
Help me!

53:08.644 --> 53:10.937
Help me!

53:10.938 --> 53:13.340
Help!

53:16.986 --> 53:19.054
Help me!

54:33.020 --> 54:35.214
Clay.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.061
Shit.

55:11.559 --> 55:13.627
Come on.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.644
Shit.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.914
Please don't hurt me.

55:57.730 --> 56:00.007
It's okay.

56:02.818 --> 56:04.569
Jason.

56:04.570 --> 56:06.847
It's okay.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.445
- This way.
- Okay.

56:55.121 --> 56:57.523
In my next life...

56:57.748 --> 57:00.083
I wanna come back...

57:00.084 --> 57:03.987
as one of the buttons on the
ass pocket of her jean shorts.

57:05.131 --> 57:09.175
- Just go over there and fucking talk to her.
- Are you kidding me?

57:09.176 --> 57:12.746
I have a better shot at fucking
a penguin than that girl.

57:19.728 --> 57:22.506
- Let's light this bad boy.
- Great.

57:25.526 --> 57:27.636
Here we go.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.113
Yes.

57:30.114 --> 57:31.865
Hey.

57:31.866 --> 57:35.577
Here's to Daddy's shoes
and fucking douche bags.

57:35.578 --> 57:39.414
- Let's just all be one big happy cliché.
- Yes.

57:39.415 --> 57:43.694
Dude, what the fuck? Please,
try not to burn down my house.

57:46.338 --> 57:48.907
Did you forget how to drink that?

57:51.552 --> 57:53.620
Just bring it to your lips...

57:54.680 --> 57:56.748
blow...

57:57.850 --> 57:59.960
and suck.

58:00.728 --> 58:03.839
- You're really good at that.
- Mm-hm.

58:09.403 --> 58:12.238
Fuck, dude! You just broke
my dad's fucking chair.

58:12.239 --> 58:13.490
My fucking lip, man.

58:13.491 --> 58:16.993
I don't care about your fucking lip.
This is a family heirloom.

58:16.994 --> 58:20.079
- Oh, shit. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- Fuck!

58:20.080 --> 58:23.166
I just... No, I can fix this.
I just need some tools.

58:23.167 --> 58:26.252
- He can fix it.
- You better pull some MacGyver shit.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.947
All right, go to the toolshed.
It's down the path.

58:29.256 --> 58:31.841
Yeah, okay. I'm just...
Trent, I'm sorry, man.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.426
You won't be disappointed.

58:33.427 --> 58:36.095
They don't call me "wood
wizard" because I masturbate.

58:36.096 --> 58:38.832
Grab a flashlight,
you fucking idiot.

58:39.183 --> 58:40.667
Thanks.

58:42.937 --> 58:45.230
Forget about it. He'll fix it.

58:45.231 --> 58:47.507
Let's go finish this.

58:53.656 --> 58:56.725
That's a ugly fucking chair anyway.

58:56.784 --> 58:59.494
My name is Trent. My daddy
bent me over this chair...

58:59.495 --> 59:02.731
and beat me when I was little,
so you need to fix it.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.367
Hey, now.

59:14.468 --> 59:16.745
Yes.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.880
You people are rich.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.440
Holy crap.

59:29.441 --> 59:33.762
Poor people call this
a house. Jesus Christ.

59:40.327 --> 59:43.079
You have never used this shit.

59:43.080 --> 59:46.692
Fucking douche bag.
Skis. What the fuck?

59:50.671 --> 59:53.907
Ha! Ha!

59:54.341 --> 59:57.953
"Lagavulin, product of Scotland."

59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.179
Oh.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.916
That just smells like money.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.689
I knew there was a reason
to be your friend, Trent.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:14.302
More? Oh, absolutely. No... All right,
you don't have to force it on me.

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.113
Fuck.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.433
You can grease wheels
with this shit.

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.852
That's payment for
being a douche bag.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.234
Okay.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.628
Oh, yeah.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:34.865
Oh, wow. Your tits are stupendous.

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:37.717
Wow, you really know how to
make a girl feel special, huh?

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.120
That's what I do.

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:57.345
Oh, man.

01:00:57.363 --> 01:01:00.640
All right. Let's see
what you've got.

01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:05.995
All right, give me something, baby.
What you got for me? Give me something.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.873
Goddamn. Not even a swimsuit? Shit.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:11.584
Goddamn winter catalog.

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:13.236
Oh, okay.

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:18.241
Gonna have to do.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:25.499
Lady, I'm about to
ruin your perfect day.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.343
All right.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.445
Shit. You scared the
piss out of me.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:43.074
Where is everybody? There's a guy
out there carrying a dead body.

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:44.575
Jenna, where's the phone?

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.411
I don't know. Over there?

01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:50.540
You fucking with me because I'm high?
That's not cool. I just finished smoking.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.692
Where's the phone?

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.296
Hi, I want to report a homicide.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.715
Clay Miller.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.426
Yeah, I'm at a house by
Crystal Lake. It's...

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:03.370
Yeah, that's it. Hurry.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.264
They said they're sending someone.

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:07.974
- Police?
- Yeah.

01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:11.310
- Where is everybody else?
- I don't know. I've been here all day.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.980
Chelsea and Nolan left, like,
hours ago to the lake.

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.691
- Well, what about Trent? Bree?
- They're in the bedroom.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.323
- Your tits are fucking just...
- I know.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.017
so juicy, dude.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:30.564
You got perfect nipple
placement, baby.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.585
This better not go on
the fucking Internet.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.702
Trent, Bree. You guys in there?

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:49.307
Trent! Bree!

01:02:49.308 --> 01:02:51.209
Shut the fuck up!

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.478
Get out here!

01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:55.922
They're just fucking with us.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.594
- Ignore her.
- Come on, guys.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:03.362
Get out here. There's
a guy out there.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:06.433
- We're busy in here, baby.
- Trent.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:14.957
Yeah.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:18.377
Okay. All right, Trent.
Let me educate you.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:22.882
You ever seen a crossover before,
huh? I'm gonna show you right now.

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:25.718
I'll bet you never... Whoa. Ow.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.996
Jesus.

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.921
Hey.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.632
Now, this is a man's sport.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:43.220
You're even curved to the
left, like my penis.

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:47.474
Okay, it's overtime. Line change.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.825
Chewie's on the ice.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:53.230
Send the puck around the back of the net.
Here we go. Pass back to the middle. Oh!

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:58.459
Oh, my...

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.987
No, no, no.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.825
Shit.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.455
Shit.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:23.176
Oh, God. You scared the
shit out of me, bro.

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:27.071
Are you looking for this?

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:31.434
Because it completes your outfit.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.356
Oh, fuck.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.919
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.500
No.

01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:50.347
- I'm close, baby. I'm close.
- I'm close too.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.874
Oh, baby.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.710
That was...

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.946
Stupendous?

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:12.202
To say the least, yeah.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:21.544
- Who's messing with the lights?
- Oh, shit. Chewie's still out there.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.314
- Phone's dead. Do you have a cell?
- Nothing has a signal.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.732
What are you doing here?

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.484
- Trent...
- Get the fuck out, buddy.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.929
- Easy.
- He's just trying to help us.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:35.574
You leave with this guy for eight
hours, fucking all over the woods?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.619
You know what? Why don't both
of you just get the fuck out?

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.746
- There's a bigger problem...
- Shut up.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:43.290
Are you serious? There
is a killer out there.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.001
He's the one who cut the lights.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:48.713
Trent, don't you get it? Chelsea
and Nolan never came back.

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:50.297
Lawrence, what are you doing?

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:53.410
My boy's still out there.
I'm gonna go get him.

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:55.344
No, man. Don't go
out there. Please.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.581
Look, I told, all right? You
can't get a handle on me.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.000
I'll surprise you every time.

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:30.655
Chewie?

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:39.289
Hey, Chewie?

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.048
Chew, you in there?

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.703
Chewie?

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.707
Chewie, you in here?

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.770
Oh, fuck.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.238
Get the fuck off me.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:45.081
Take that, motherfucker.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:13.484
Guys, this is bullshit. The power
goes out here all the time.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.739
Help me!

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:22.092
Help! Help me!

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.345
Please, help me.

01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.722
- Lawrence.
- No, no, no. You can't go out there.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.807
- We have to help him.
- No, we can't.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:31.810
He's using your friend as bait.
He wants us to go out.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.562
Well, you don't know that.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.397
Jesus, where are the police?

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.342
I can't move.

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.636
- Help me!
- We have to help him.

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:41.304
I can't die like this.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.724
Help me, please. Trent.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:47.143
Somebody, help.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:48.978
Oh, my God, please.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.356
I can't fucking...

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:53.691
Somebody's gotta do something!

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.737
Please.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.970
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:27.183
Everyone's gonna be okay, all right?
The cops are on their way.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.105
What are you doing?

01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:49.080
Trent.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.507
Jenna?

01:14:29.883 --> 01:14:31.550
Police.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:34.704
- Oh, thank God.
- Go, go.

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:38.165
Police, open up.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:45.590
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:54.031
Get the door.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:55.824
Okay. Shit.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:59.312
- What are you doing? Is he inside?
- He killed the cop.

01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:03.232
What the fuck, you got
a gun? Let's go now.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.904
Jesus! What are you doing?

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.506
Give me the gun.

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:12.450
Someone's in there.

01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:16.621
Check it out.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:34.722
Bree's dead. He killed Bree.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.148
Come on.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.777
Come on.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:51.197
There's no gun, no keys,
nothing. Let's go.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.372
Where are the keys?

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:06.562
- Help! We got officers down.
- My keys are gone. Where are my keys?

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:09.507
Hey, Jenna, fuck this guy.
Let's get out of here.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:18.057
Go. Go. Go, go, go! Jesus.

01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:47.086
Shit. Where the fuck are you, gun?

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.255
Fuck.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:57.430
Fuck it.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.186
He was headed this way.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:29.522
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:28.581
Help!

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.182
Shh.

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:31.975
- What was that?
- Let me out!

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:35.004
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:39.149
Help me!

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:41.093
Help me.

01:20:49.095 --> 01:20:51.163
This way.

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:12.784
- Clay?
- Whitney. Whitney.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:15.161
- Oh, God, Clay.
- Thank God.

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:17.539
Are you okay? You okay? Thank God.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.984
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:23.153
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay. You're okay?

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.947
Oh, God.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.299
- Okay.
- Just get me out of here.

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.884
Fuck.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.553
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
- Can you break it?

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.956
- No, just break it, just break it.
- Okay.

01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:37.309
Yeah, just go. Go.
Just fucking do it.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:39.978
- Hold still. Hold your hands.
- Hurry up, hurry.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.964
Do it. Fucking do it.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:47.402
- We gotta get out of here.
- I don't wanna hit you.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.654
- Just fucking do it.
- Okay, okay.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.098
Hurry.

01:21:53.451 --> 01:21:55.352
Oh, God.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.000
Holy shit.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.028
Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.504
You guys, I can see
him. He's coming.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.089
- What?
- We gotta go.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.842
- Grab onto me. Grab onto me.
- Let's go. Come on, hurry.

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:12.494
GO, go!

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:15.998
Go. Come on.

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:37.853
Go. Go.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.045
It's a dead end.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:48.588
What are we gonna do?

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.741
Clay?

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:52.993
Hurry.

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:54.953
Here. Here.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.460
Come on, we can get through here.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.755
Follow me.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:07.315
- Go, go, go.
- It's safe, guys.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.026
Give me your hand, Jenna.
Come on, hurry.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.763
Give me your hand. Okay. I got you.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:18.894
Oh, my... Fuck. Jesus, God, no.

01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.231
- Oh, God. Clay. Clay.
- No. No.

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:26.693
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Clay.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:28.987
Come on, we gotta go.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.834
Look. I think this
might be a way out.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:55.722
All right. Let's go.
Come on. Hurry.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:59.893
Let's go. Watch out.

01:24:02.288 --> 01:24:03.580
Come on.

01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:05.165
- Hurry.
- Damn it. It's stuck.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:06.374
Come on, come on.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.861
- Come on.
- Hurry.

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:21.765
Give me your hand. Give me your
hand. Give me your hand. Okay.

01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:24.710
On three. One... Come on.

01:24:25.853 --> 01:24:30.048
- Run. Whitney, get...
- Clay! Clay! Clay!

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:31.800
Stop it!

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:34.069
No!

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:36.472
Clay! Clay!

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:41.143
Shit. Shit.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:26.522
Fuck you.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.546
No, no, no!

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:45.598
Whitney!

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:48.852
- Whitney.
- Clay. Clay!

01:25:48.853 --> 01:25:50.796
Come on.

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:55.759
Hurry.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:58.220
Come on.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.946
Hide.

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:24.014
Shit, fuck.

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.109
Jason.

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:31.748
It's okay.

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.127
You can stop now.

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:37.963
It's okay.

01:29:50.803 --> 01:29:52.537
Jason.

01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.499
Say hi to Mommy...

01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:59.336
in hell.
