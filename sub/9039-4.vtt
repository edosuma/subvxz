01:53.367 --> 01:55.667
ON HOW TO TALK
TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT SEX.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.400
- WHY?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.167
- ACTUALLY, ALLY'S ALREADY
STARTING TO ASK QUESTIONS.

02:01.167 --> 02:02.967
- OH, REALLY?

02:02.967 --> 02:05.000
- WELL, MAY I ASK
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
THAT SHE NEEDS
TO ASK QUESTIONS?

02:09.100 --> 02:10.867
- WHAT?
NOTHING.

02:10.867 --> 02:15.133
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY MAKE
ROBES THAT COVER UP A PERSON.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.833

02:18.833 --> 02:21.367

02:21.367 --> 02:24.133
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE--I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO MY LAUNDRY.

02:24.133 --> 02:26.200
- NO, NO,
I'M REALLY SERIOUS, DEBRA.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.400
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO INTRODUCE

02:27.400 --> 02:29.200
A SUBJECT MATTER
OF THIS KIND

02:29.200 --> 02:31.300
TO AN INNOCENT CHILD?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.533
- OH, LISTEN,
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY

02:32.533 --> 02:34.267
WE'RE TAKING CARE
OF THIS,

02:34.267 --> 02:37.933
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY,
SHE MIGHT ASK YOU A QUESTION.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.733
- BUT I'M HER GRANDMOTHER.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.667
- YES, BUT YOU'RE A PERSON;
YOU'RE A WOMAN.

02:42.667 --> 02:46.300
- OH, I DON'T LIKE THIS,
DEBRA.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.367
- SHE--SHE MIGHT ASK
ABOUT YOU AND GRANDPA.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.167
- WELL, IF SHE DOES,
I WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT

02:55.167 --> 02:59.333
AND GIVE HER
A COOKIE.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.767
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DO
WHEN GRANDPA ASKS?

03:00.767 --> 03:02.167
[laughs]
I'M SORRY.

03:07.033 --> 03:10.067

03:10.067 --> 03:13.033
YES.
NOTHING'S OFF-LIMITS.

03:13.033 --> 03:15.167

I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.733

HE DOESN'T ASK ANYMORE.

03:18.733 --> 03:21.867
- REALLY?
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

03:21.867 --> 03:25.900
THERE ARE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS IN A MARRIAGE THAN THAT,

03:25.900 --> 03:28.433
LIKE FRIENDSHIP
AND TRUST

03:28.433 --> 03:32.833
AND--AND KEEPING
A NEAT HOUSE.

03:32.833 --> 03:33.933
- OH.

03:33.933 --> 03:36.700
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.700

PREOCCUPIED WITH THESE THINGS.

SINCE YOU'VE HAD...

03:46.700 --> 03:50.333
SINCE YOU STARTED FOCUSING ON
THE NEATNESS OF THE HOUSE?

03:52.600 --> 03:57.267

20 YEARS.

03:57.267 --> 04:00.167

YOU HAVEN'T--

04:00.167 --> 04:01.867

04:01.867 --> 04:06.800
I'D SAY...
OH, ONCE A YEAR.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.833
- ONCE A YEAR FOR 20 YEARS?

04:08.833 --> 04:12.100
- YEAH, ON AVERAGE.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.100
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, DEAR.

04:15.100 --> 04:21.100
SOME DAY, THIS HOUSE
WILL BE A LOT NEATER.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.733
- GOOD NIGHT.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.433

05:10.000 --> 05:12.567
- I SAID "GOOD NIGHT."

05:12.567 --> 05:14.900
- HONEY, I'M TRYING TO GET
YOUR ATTENTION.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.467
- ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME ONE SECOND?

05:16.467 --> 05:18.500
ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS GOOD.

05:18.500 --> 05:24.800
- IT'S A SCOTTISH GUY
THROWING A LOG.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.967
- FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.600

FOR YOU, RAY.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.300
YOUR SEX DRIVE
IS DIMINISHING.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.433
- WELL, IF YOU'RE MY MOM,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.667
- I'M SERIOUS, RAY.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.333
LOOK, I USED TO HAVE
TO FEND YOU OFF EVERY NIGHT.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.267
NOW IT'S DOWN
TO LESS THAN ONCE A WEEK.

- YES, IT IS, RAY.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.400

06:20.400 --> 06:22.500
WELL, MAYBE
IF I'M TRYING LESS,

06:22.500 --> 06:25.400
IT'S BECAUSE OF ALL
THE REJECTION, HUH?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.733
YEAH, I'M LIKE THE MONKEY
WHO GETS SHOCKED

06:27.733 --> 06:31.067
EVERY TIME HE REACHES
FOR THE PELLET.

06:33.233 --> 06:36.200
- DO YOU REALIZE THAT
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS,

06:36.200 --> 06:38.900
YOUR PARENTS HAVE ONLY HAD SEX
ONCE A YEAR?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.933
- WHAT?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.133
- YOUR MOTHER.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.667
- WHAT?
WHAT? WHAT?

06:44.667 --> 06:47.000
WHY? WHY?
WHY DID YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.600
- 'CAUSE SHE SAW
THE SEX BOOK,

06:48.600 --> 06:51.067
AND WE JUST STARTED TALKING,
AND SHE TOLD ME.

06:51.067 --> 06:54.133
- WELL, WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME?

06:54.133 --> 06:56.467
- BECAUSE YOU'RE TURNING
INTO YOUR FATHER.

06:56.467 --> 06:59.067
LISTEN, THINGS STARTED
SLOWING DOWN FOR THEM

06:59.067 --> 07:02.767
WHEN THEY WERE THE AGE
THAT WE ARE NOW.

07:02.767 --> 07:06.700
- WE'RE NOT THEM.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.233

RUBBED YOUR CHEST,

07:10.233 --> 07:12.167
KISSED YOU AGAIN
IN AN IMPURE MANNER.

07:12.167 --> 07:15.300
YOU NEVER TOOK YOUR EYES
OFF THE TV.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.867
TEN YEARS AGO,
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS BE AWAKE.

07:19.867 --> 07:23.000
SOMETIMES
NOT EVEN THAT.

07:26.267 --> 07:30.600
- I'M STILL--I'M STILL...

I DON'T WANT TO DO IT

07:52.300 --> 07:53.733
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO PROVE SOMETHING.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.467
- I DON'T WANT
TO PROVE SOMETHING.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.700
I JUST LOVE
TO SEX YOU UP.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.200

FREQUENCY.

09:03.933 --> 09:06.633
- FREQUENCY WITH ME AND AMY?

09:06.633 --> 09:08.200

AMY WOULD APPRECIATE

09:08.200 --> 09:10.667
HER NAME COMING UP
IN THIS TYPE OF...

09:10.667 --> 09:12.533

09:27.600 --> 09:30.100
BECAUSE I HAVE
A SUPERIOR NAMED GAIL.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.400
SHE'S A BEAST.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL HER MOM.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.767

YOU CAN PICK ANY NAME.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.133
- ANOTHER NAME?

11:33.133 --> 11:35.033

11:52.133 --> 11:54.233
YOU DON'T GOT TO ANSWER.

11:54.233 --> 11:55.667
I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER,
ALL RIGHT?

- WELL, I MIGHT NOT BE
WHERE I WAS AT YOUR AGE,

12:52.733 --> 12:57.400
BUT I THINK A COUPLE OF TIMES
A WEEK IS PRETTY GOOD.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.933
- COUPLE TIMES A WEEK?

13:13.933 --> 13:18.067
- HOLY CRAP.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.467
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.500
AND NOW
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

13:21.500 --> 13:26.100
ALL THIS TALK HAS KIND OF
PUT ME IN THE MOOD.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.333
- WE SHOULD BE HAVING SEX
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.400
- WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT FROM?

13:42.400 --> 13:45.533
- THESE ARE
THE NUMBERS, MAN.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.767
IF WE WANT TO BE DOING IT
TWICE A WEEK 20 YEARS FROM NOW,

13:49.767 --> 13:52.767
WE SHOULD BE DOING IT
THREE TIMES A WEEK NOW.

13:52.767 --> 13:53.867
- WHAT?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.700
- MY FATHER TOLD ME HIS STATS.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.867
- YOU TALKED TO YOUR FATHER
ABOUT THEIR SEX LIFE?

13:59.867 --> 14:01.233
- YES, I DID, AND LISTEN,

14:01.233 --> 14:02.800
EVERYTHING MY MOTHER
TOLD YOU YESTERDAY,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.467
LIES, OKAY?

14:04.467 --> 14:06.267
MY FATHER TOLD ME
THE TRUTH.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.900
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.100
TWICE A WEEK.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.767
- NO WAY!
- YES! YES!

14:10.767 --> 14:11.933
- NO!
- YES!

14:11.933 --> 14:13.367
- NO, THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.767
YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME,
FLAT OUT, ONCE A YEAR.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.433
- AND SINCE WHEN
IS SHE EVER STRAIGHT WITH YOU?

14:19.767 --> 14:21.567
- WELL, SHE DIDN'T LIE
ABOUT THIS,

14:21.567 --> 14:25.233
A-AND FRANK WOULD LIE
ESPECIALLY ABOUT THIS.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.000
- WHY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.033
- BECAUSE HE'S A MAN.

14:29.033 --> 14:32.267
- SO? SO WHAT?
I'M A MAN.

14:32.267 --> 14:37.967
- YEAH, WELL, YOU LIE TO ME
ABOUT OUR OWN SEX LIFE.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.667
- WHEN?
WHEN DO I DO THAT?

14:39.667 --> 14:43.133
- WHAT DOES "ALL NIGHT LONG"
MEAN TO YOU?

14:49.567 --> 14:51.233
- IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

14:51.233 --> 14:53.333
NOBODY REALLY MEANS THAT.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.567
- MEN LIE,
AND YOUR FATHER'S A LIAR.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.533
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
MY MOTHER'S THE LIAR.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.600
- RAY, SHE DIDN'T LIE
TO ME ABOUT THIS.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.800
SHE OPENED UP TO ME.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.167
- OPENED UP?

15:03.167 --> 15:07.367
SHE PLAYED YOU LIKE
A HAWAIIAN ON A UKULELE.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.933
- OH, YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

15:08.933 --> 15:11.267
YOUR FATHER MAKES UP A STORY,
AND YOU JUST BELIEVE IT.

15:11.267 --> 15:12.700
- BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!

15:12.700 --> 15:13.967
- LISTEN, WHEN YOUR MOM
AND I TALKED,

15:13.967 --> 15:15.300
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE--

15:15.300 --> 15:18.467
- [singing]
LA LA-LA LA

15:18.467 --> 15:20.767
- RAY.
- [singing] LA LA-LA LA

15:20.767 --> 15:21.933
- RAY, I'M TELLING YOU.

15:21.933 --> 15:25.067
- [singing]
LA-LA-LA LA

15:25.067 --> 15:26.567
COME ON.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.233
ALL RIGHT. LOOK,
IT'S ALREADY SATURDAY.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.367
WE GOT TO DO IT
THREE TIMES TOMORROW.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.500
HI, MRS. SCARPULA.

15:43.733 --> 15:46.100
- OKAY, LISTEN, I GOT TO ASK
BOTH OF YOU A QUESTION.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.467
- SURE, DEAR.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.267
WHAT IS IT?

15:54.933 --> 15:57.067
- UH...

15:57.067 --> 15:58.933
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:58.933 --> 16:00.233
- UH...

16:00.233 --> 16:02.800
- SHE--SHE WANTED
TO ASK US SOMETHING.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.967
WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.200
- UM...

16:05.200 --> 16:08.067
- YES,
WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

16:11.467 --> 16:14.233
- WE'VE BEEN GETTING
SOME CONFLICTING REPORTS,

16:14.233 --> 16:18.133
AND, UH, WHAT WE WOULD BOTH
LIKE TO KNOW IS

16:18.133 --> 16:23.400
HOW OFTEN DO THE TWO OF YOU
ACTUALLY...

16:25.267 --> 16:27.567
- GO TO THE THEATER?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.333
- HAVE SEX.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.600
- [laughs]

16:37.600 --> 16:41.567
OH, THIS IS AS BAD
AS IT GETS.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.600
- OH, MY GOD!

16:43.600 --> 16:45.867
- MARIE, LISTEN,
I WOULD NEVER ASK EXCEPT--

16:45.867 --> 16:49.367
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEANING
OF A PRIVATE CONVERSATION?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.400
- YES, OF COURSE I DO,
BUT FRANK SAID SOMETHING THAT--

16:51.400 --> 16:54.400
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- HEY, I DIDN'T TALK TO HER.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.933
THANKS FOR BLABBING
MY BUSINESS.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.867
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SO MAD ABOUT?

16:58.867 --> 17:00.033
YOU WERE PROUD OF IT.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.067
JUST SAY THE NUMBER.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.833
- NO.
DON'T YOU DARE!

17:02.833 --> 17:06.000
HAVE YOU
NO BOUNDARIES?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.567
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.200
IF IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN,
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.267
TWICE A WEEK.
- OH, FRANK!

17:11.267 --> 17:12.967
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
DON'T LIE LIKE THAT.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.567
- OKAY, SEE?

17:14.567 --> 17:16.300
- HEY, WHO'S LYING?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.700
- WHY ARE WE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION?

17:18.700 --> 17:22.200
- COME ON, MARIE,
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION HERE.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.933
WORD OF MOUTH IS EVERYTHING
IN THIS BUSINESS.

17:25.933 --> 17:28.133
- I HAPPEN TO BE
A LADY, FRANK.

17:28.133 --> 17:29.633
- [titters]
- OOH!

17:29.633 --> 17:32.567
- [laughs]

17:34.867 --> 17:37.567
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MARIE?

17:37.567 --> 17:39.467
IS IT TRUE?

17:40.967 --> 17:42.767
- YES, IT'S TRUE!

17:42.767 --> 17:44.267
- WHAT?

17:53.033 --> 17:55.367
- SEE?

17:55.367 --> 17:58.633
EWW.

17:58.633 --> 18:01.567
- WHY DID YOU TELL ME
IT WAS ONLY ONCE A YEAR?

18:01.567 --> 18:04.300
- BECAUSE THIS WHOLE TOPIC
IS IMPROPER.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.967
WHAT WE DO IN OUR BEDROOM
IS OUR OWN BUSINESS,

18:05.967 --> 18:09.300
AND I PREFER NOT TO BE KNOWN
AS THE WHORE OF LYNBROOK.

18:14.067 --> 18:17.200
- WE CAN MOVE
FROM LYNBROOK.

18:28.367 --> 18:31.567
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MARIE.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.567
WHAT ARE YOU
SO ASHAMED OF?

18:33.567 --> 18:35.700
- SHE'S ASHAMED TO ADMIT
SHE LIKES IT.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.800
- OH, FRANK!

18:37.800 --> 18:40.433
HOW DO YOU KNOW I LIKE IT?

18:40.433 --> 18:42.067
- WELL, WHO WOULDN'T
LIKE IT?

18:42.067 --> 18:44.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ADMIT IT, MARIE?

18:44.333 --> 18:45.933
- YES, IT'S TRUE.

18:45.933 --> 18:48.400
I ENJOY MY SEX LIFE.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.167
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.333
I MEAN, FORGIVE ME,
BUT IN MY DAY,

18:54.333 --> 18:56.933
A WOMAN DIDN'T DISCUSS
THESE THINGS.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.533
I MEAN, SEX WAS
A WIFELY DUTY,

18:58.533 --> 19:01.000
AND THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS

19:01.000 --> 19:03.967
THAT YOUR FATHER
HAPPENS TO BE...

19:03.967 --> 19:06.767
VERY COMPETENT.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.167
A-A-AND IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT I'M A WOMAN,

19:12.167 --> 19:15.567
AND I HAVE NEEDS
LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.067
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BE ASHAMED OF SEX,

19:18.067 --> 19:21.600
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY NATURAL PART
OF LIFE.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.500
AND IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO STILL ENJOY

19:24.500 --> 19:28.600
THE PLEASURES OF IT,
THEN I'M GOING TO.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.700
- OH, GOD.

19:43.433 --> 19:49.067
- AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU CAME OVER?

19:49.067 --> 19:50.500
- FRANK, TELL THE TRUTH.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.767
IT'S NOT TWICE A WEEK.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.233
- WELL, GIVE OR TAKE.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.600
THE POINT IS,
WE'RE NOT DEAD.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.867
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,

19:59.867 --> 20:04.033
BUT I ACTUALLY WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.700
- GO AHEAD, DEAR.

20:05.700 --> 20:09.567
- HOW CAN YOU TWO BE SO...

20:09.567 --> 20:14.367
SHOULDN'T YOU TWO BE TIRED?

20:14.367 --> 20:16.100
- WHAT'S THERE
TO BE TIRED ABOUT?

20:16.100 --> 20:17.433
I DON'T WORK ANYMORE.

20:17.433 --> 20:21.167
WHAT ELSE DO I GOT TO DO?

20:21.167 --> 20:24.100
- AND YOU'RE FORGETTING THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE SEX.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.433
- OH, GOD.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.767
- THE KIDS ARE
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.400
[both laugh]

20:30.400 --> 20:34.333
- YEAH, FOR YEARS,
YOU WERE DRAGGING US DOWN.

20:36.967 --> 20:38.367
- YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT

20:38.367 --> 20:40.567
WHEN ROBBIE WENT TO
HIS NEW APARTMENT?

20:40.567 --> 20:43.967
- [laughs]

20:43.967 --> 20:45.900
- OKAY, COME ON, HONEY.

20:45.900 --> 20:49.233
I THINK THERE'S A BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH WITH OUR NAME ON IT.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.467
HEY, UH,
DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONAL,

20:55.467 --> 20:58.567
BUT FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS,
NO EYE CONTACT.

21:06.967 --> 21:09.367
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:09.367 --> 21:13.700
- OH, STOP IT, FRANK.
I'M TIRED.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.700
- ALL RIGHT.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.567
THE SOUP'S GOOD.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.800
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:25.800 --> 21:27.333
- I JUST--I WANT TO,

21:27.333 --> 21:31.700
BUT THERE'S STILL THESE PICTURES
IN MY HEAD.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.133
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO,

21:33.133 --> 21:35.033
YOU JUST SHAKE YOUR HEAD
LIKE AN ETCH-A-SKETCH.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.533
[groans]

21:39.967 --> 21:41.167
- WHAT WAS THAT?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.567
- OH.
- WAS THAT SOMETHING?

21:42.567 --> 21:44.533
- THE KIDS?

21:44.533 --> 21:47.500
- NO, MAYBE NOT.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.167
- MOMMY!

21:49.167 --> 21:50.567
[both groan]

21:50.567 --> 21:51.867
- OKAY, I'LL GO.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.100
- THANKS.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.500
14 YEARS TILL COLLEGE.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.533
- YEAH,
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
