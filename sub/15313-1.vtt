00:07.760 --> 00:09.716
(Horse grunts)

00:41.960 --> 00:43.359
Hold him.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.352
— You know the law.
— I know the law is an ass.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.194
The price for one of the King's deer
is your right hand.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.510
— Let's go.
— No.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.717
— Please, have mercy. My wife...
— What?

00:55.800 --> 00:58.633
My wife expects a child.
We have no food.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.551
She must eat
or we'll lose the baby.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.677
And when she has the baby
you will say you must steal

01:03.760 --> 01:05.910
because you have
another mouth to feed.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.719
— Bring him.
— Please. No, I need my hand.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.870
We can punish you now.

01:10.960 --> 01:15.590
If you admit your guilt, the punishment
is lessened. We can take a finger.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.797
But you will have no right to trial.
No defence, no appeal.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.678
I will lose a trial.
And my hand.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.516
— Take a finger.
— Do it.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.038
Come on.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.669
Pop your hand on there.
Like this.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.479
— Er... I've changed my mind.
— No appeal.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.548
What the...?

01:49.520 --> 01:52.876
— Who's there?
— Seems I missed your hand.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.190
Let him go
before my aim improves.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.511
Show yourself.
You interfere with the law of the land!

02:00.680 --> 02:06.437
The last time I looked, the law punished
poaching with a tanning or a spell in the stocks.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.149
The law is under threat
and must be severe if it is to be respected.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.153
If the law wants respect,
shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.231
I do not make the law.
I do not decide.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.311
But you enforce it.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.188
And my men and | suggest
that you decide to go on your way.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.275
They've got us surrounded, sir.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.674
— And let this man feed his hungry wife.
— I don't know...

02:39.760 --> 02:41.557
You know!

02:46.680 --> 02:48.830
And what does that prove?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.316
Missed again.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.391
Let him go.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.789
God bless you, sir.
God bless you all, gents.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.309
Come. We leave these rogues
to their crimes.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.919
Us...

03:11.000 --> 03:12.638
rogues?

03:12.720 --> 03:15.792
Don't show your faces here again,
cowards!

03:15.880 --> 03:18.394
— Shh... Quiet!
— Why?

03:18.480 --> 03:21.278
We have won
and they should be ashamed!

03:21.360 --> 03:23.078
Shame on you!

03:23.160 --> 03:25.390
Come back here again
and my master and l

03:25.480 --> 03:30.349
shall see that you leave with more than
just your tails between your legs.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.115
"My master and I?"
There are only two of them!

03:34.200 --> 03:36.191
I shouldn't have said that.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.872
Run, Robin. Run!

04:51.240 --> 04:53.037
Clever, master...

05:25.960 --> 05:31.159
Five years in battle, Much,
and you still forget the Last Man!

05:31.240 --> 05:33.800
There's always
so much to remember.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.474
(Much) When I see the River Trent,
I'm going to weep.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.437
I'm going to cry like a baby.

05:42.520 --> 05:46.399
For all the pain we've suffered in Palestine,
the horrors we've witnessed.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.677
And because I am so hungry.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.593
When we get to Locksley,
I'm going to have beef.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.309
— Yesterday you said pig.
— Yesterday l was not so hungry.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.188
I mean I could have pig and beef.
And lamb.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.397
Mmm... I'd like that. Very much.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.075
In fact, I can feel
a song coming on...

06:07.160 --> 06:09.469
No! No song.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.630
Absolutely no song.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.359
— It would be a cheery song.
— It would be a tragedy too.

06:14.440 --> 06:20.037
A tragedy for you to have survived the Turk
and made it to within a few miles of Locksley,

06:20.120 --> 06:23.510
only to be killed
by your own master.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.036
You know, it is lucky
I do not readily take offence.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.078
You know, a smaller man
would be offended.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.676
— A smaller man would be wounded.
— And a cleverer man would sing fewer songs.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.513
(Much) So, master,
no stopping here, all right?

06:38.600 --> 06:41.353
No stopping anywhere,
no more heroics.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.670
We're going home,
we're going straight home.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.837
— Nathan.
— You two on the run?

06:49.920 --> 06:53.276
No, we're returning to Locksley
after a long absence.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.717
You look like
you're on the run.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.313
Want to give me a hand with this ditch?
There's a meal in it.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.233
Me daughter Sarah and l,
we've a pork roasting.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.357
— Master, we could, couldn't we?
— Much, we are nearly home!

07:07.440 --> 07:10.671
Please... Please?

07:13.320 --> 07:16.278
I love you.
Have I ever said that?

07:17.800 --> 07:21.793
Call that digging?
Have you ever done a proper day's work?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.952
(Much) Roast. ..pork.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.837
Roast...

07:27.760 --> 07:29.990
Roast... pork...

07:35.400 --> 07:36.958
(Rob/n) Ahem...

07:38.200 --> 07:39.952
Thank you.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.194
— Where are you two headed?
— Home...to Locksley.

07:45.280 --> 07:49.353
It's getting late. You and your friend
should stay in our barn tonight.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.148
That is very kind
but I don't think that would be...

07:54.240 --> 07:58.631
Someone special waiting for you, is there?
In Locksley?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.759
I doubt it.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.070
— My friend and l...
— Then what's your hurry?

08:03.160 --> 08:06.869
— Your father!
— He'd kill you if he saw...

08:06.960 --> 08:09.997
— Sarah...
— But he won't see.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.317
The Sheriff wants cloth dyed for his men
in lieu of taxes.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.312
Taxes that I cannot afford
cos nobody has money to buy my cloth.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.956
Well...

08:30.040 --> 08:32.793
You know,
he is a fair—minded old man.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.553
I'm sure if you explain
your difficulties to him,

08:35.640 --> 08:37.471
if you kiss him.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.755
— Kiss him?
— Kiss his ring.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.071
— He will understand.
— You really have been away.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.151
The old man is finished.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.152
We've had a new Sheriff
these last four years.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.514
— Where's that food?
— Really?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.716
That is interesting.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.553
Because, he's a...
fair—minded old man.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.153
I told you.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.118
We've a new, young...
You're not listening.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.796
Robin!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.113
My daughter!

09:14.200 --> 09:16.395
I meant no offence!
I do not wish to fight!

09:16.480 --> 09:18.948
Well, bad luck! I do!
Argh!

09:26.120 --> 09:30.671
You picked the wrong man. I did not always
work cloth. I once worked metal.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.989
l was never beaten with a sword.
Not by knight, not by knave.

09:41.000 --> 09:41.910
Much!

09:47.920 --> 09:48.670
Master!

10:02.680 --> 10:04.159
Ha!

10:09.960 --> 10:11.154
(Ye/ls)

10:12.760 --> 10:15.354
Much. Fetch the packs.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.919
Run!

10:30.120 --> 10:32.350
Oh, sir, sir!

10:32.440 --> 10:34.317
You have me.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.472
— Allow me one final request.
— What's that?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.351
One last kiss.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.714
(Much)
I told you! I said no stopping!

11:00.800 --> 11:03.075
Why do you never ever listen?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.639
Faster! Go!

11:21.800 --> 11:23.791
I'm not saying anything.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.638
Hey there!

12:15.280 --> 12:17.111
Where is everybody?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.637
Dan Scarlett?!

12:25.920 --> 12:27.797
— Dan, it's me, Robin!
— Robin?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.711
— Yes!
— Is it really you?

12:29.800 --> 12:32.473
— Of course it's us.
— We are home unscathed.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.516
Well... scathed.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.715
Very scathed.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.712
But happy.
And hungry. Mostly hungry.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.678
Blessed Mary, it is you!

12:47.400 --> 12:50.198
— An accident?
— An incident.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.550
No matter.
What's done is done.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.471
Tell me.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.872
Guy of Gisborne runs your estate
for the Sheriff.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.790
Does he?

13:01.880 --> 13:06.556
We have one tithe after another for the King
in the Holy Land. Making ends meet...

13:07.480 --> 13:11.917
It was wrong, but my boys,
they took some game.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.389
I went to stop them,
but so did Gisborne's lot.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.198
They got caught.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.068
Me too.
Someone had to lose a hand.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.628
Better me than Will,
or little Lukey.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.359
I'm old.
They've got years ahead of them.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.635
This is madness.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.156
You are a skilled man,
you built half this village.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.071
I won't have this.
You will be compensated.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.391
| see my boys in good health
and I am happy.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.075
It's all right, boys!

13:41.160 --> 13:42.593
This is Master Robin.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.636
You're all right. Come on.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.591
This is my bow.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.957
My dad made if for me.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.190
— Why has yours got those curves in it?
— Well, this is a Saracen bow.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.677
It is recurved.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.432
The bows straighten...

14:02.520 --> 14:04.272
when you draw.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.158
Makes it small but powerful.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.475
Is it true you can hit a man
from a mile away?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.198
If I practise every day,
I'll do that.

14:14.280 --> 14:18.717
— Let's hope you never have to shoot a man.
— (Luke) Yeah, that's what Dad says.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.476
I bet you killed loads of men
when you were fighting with the King.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.959
Look.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.759
OK, keep your chin up.
And remember to...

14:32.120 --> 14:35.237
— to take a breath first!
— Wait, wait.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.880
He's a credit
to you and Jane.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.358
No...

14:42.440 --> 14:44.510
Two years.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.956
Told us she was eating.
Don't think she was.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.349
Couldn't see her boys starve.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.554
The whole village has suffered.
Not just us.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.676
Jane, your good strong wife...

14:59.000 --> 15:00.558
(Horse neighs)

15:19.520 --> 15:20.635
Come on!

15:20.720 --> 15:23.792
Come on, stand there
and don't move!

15:23.880 --> 15:27.589
Ten sacks of flour
have gone missing from the store.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.557
They will be found.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.355
Go on, get out of here
with the rest of 'em.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.953
They will be accounted for.

15:34.640 --> 15:38.269
Come on, stop struggling!
Go on, get out there!

15:38.360 --> 15:39.873
No more, sir.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.510
Who helped this... runt?

15:47.640 --> 15:50.154
Step forward now.
I may show lenience.

15:53.480 --> 15:59.191
No... The remaining perpetrators will be found.
This crime will be punished. Bring the boy.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.315
Wait.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.916
— Guy of Gisborne?
— Sir Guy of Gisborne to you.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.639
And bow before your master.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.631
Sir Guy of Gisborne.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.508
My name is Robin,
Earl of Huntingdon and lord of this manor.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.592
Your services here
are no longer required.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.356
Charles. Thomas.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.754
— Thornton.
— Welcome back, sir.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.073
A bath for the master, Hannah,
and fresh clothes immediately.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.115
Mary!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.713
— And me too.
— Pardon?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.153
Thornton.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.789
— Much is no longer my manservant.
— Oh?

17:05.880 --> 17:10.476
In recognition of his services to me in
the Holy Land, he is to be made a free man!

17:10.560 --> 17:13.154
I am granting him the fields
and lodge at Bonchurch.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.789
Until then he's a guest
in my house.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.194
And I would like a plate of something
while I bathe.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.916
Very well.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.349
That is the way
to the servants' quarters.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.917
I knew that.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.272
Welcome back, Locksley.
Now...

17:41.360 --> 17:44.591
l have kept
your lands for you.

17:44.680 --> 17:50.118
l have managed your estates to the best of
my ability under the guidance of the Sheriff.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.715
And I would appreciate more respect
in front of the populace.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.873
— How many years have you been here?
— Three years. Four winters.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.158
And yet you still do not have
the respect of the populace?

18:03.240 --> 18:07.438
— My men and I will leave for Nottingham.
— My servants will help you pack.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.348
— How was the Holy Land?
— Bloodthirsty.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.119
I understand the King is winning,
thanks be to God.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.350
— He is killing more people...
— Is that not winning?

18:18.440 --> 18:21.876
Show me an argument ever settled with
bloodshed and then I'll call it winning.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.235
Do not pretend
that you do not love war.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.709
— I've seen you fight.
— When?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.032
I do not recall.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.996
I've changed.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.950
The Council of Nobles meets
tomorrow at Nottingham.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.510
I've no doubt the Sheriff will call a feast
to celebrate your safe return.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.433
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.116
One thing.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.595
I shall celebrate
my safe return too,

18:50.680 --> 18:54.275
by pardoning all wrongdoers from my estates
awaiting trial or punishment.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.032
Only the Sheriff
can pardon.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.715
It is custom for the Sheriff to accede
to his nobles' requests on such matters.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.792
Well, then I suggest you take it
up with the Sheriff.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.430
Was it horrible? The war?
What was it like?

19:21.520 --> 19:24.717
War is for...
for men.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.436
— You would be upset, little one.
— Yeah?

19:29.520 --> 19:32.876
I heard that dying men always
ask for their mums.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.954
— That's for the bath.
— What?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.996
Rose petals.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.512
I knew that.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.950
Much, get dressed.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.952
— If you want to visit the old Sheriff.
— Really?

20:16.040 --> 20:22.354
I would prefer, I have to say,
the whole food, bath, sleep thing.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.159
Of course.
I forgot my promise to you.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.071
You don't have to come.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.789
— Is something wrong?
— England is wrong.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.839
And Nottinghamshire is worse.
The old Sheriff would never have allowed this.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.754
I have to hear his story
before I go to Nottingham tomorrow.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.190
Sleep well, my friend.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.358
You have earned it.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.474
Master!

20:57.560 --> 20:59.437
But Master, the food...

20:59.520 --> 21:03.957
Go into the village,
bring every family here and feed them.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.713
Nobody here eats until they do,
including me.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.155
Those who are ill,
take the food to them.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.754
— Yes, master.
— Ian?

21:11.840 --> 21:15.389
Obviously you don't mean that
about nobody eating.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.754
No?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.432
No, of course not.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.158
That's fine.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.352
That's fine.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.032
Has anyone seen my horse?

21:34.280 --> 21:36.271
Get out!
Get away from here!

21:36.360 --> 21:39.033
Edward! It is me, your friend,
Robin of Locksley.

21:39.120 --> 21:43.193
I know who you are. Crooks, come
to deceive me. I'll have none of you here.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.316
I swear
I come in friendship!

21:45.400 --> 21:50.394
Get away! I am no longer the Sheriff.
Leave me to live out my days in peace.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.835
You heard my father.
Leave!

21:53.480 --> 21:55.072
Marian!

21:55.600 --> 21:57.158
It is me, Robin.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.356
Congratulations. Leave.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.954
How are you?
I thought of you.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.758
Leave.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.353
We are leaving.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.829
Sir Edward, if you do not remember me,
remember Nottingham.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.831
Remember your people!

22:10.440 --> 22:12.749
— Interesting.
— Interesting?

22:13.440 --> 22:15.317
That's unbelievable.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.474
He used to treat us like...
like sons.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.152
She is still unmarried.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.596
Oh! And I thought you'd come
to see the old Sheriff.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.395
— I did!
— Please.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.319
Bless you, Master Robin.
We have all eaten well.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.153
Is there any food left?
I must confess, I am anxious.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.754
— Robin! Robin!
— Jeffrey?

22:43.840 --> 22:46.115
Remember this?
Remember this?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.191
(Silly voice)
My 899 my €99!

22:48.280 --> 22:50.271
Where's it gone?

22:51.360 --> 22:54.238
You've eaten it.
No I haven't...

22:54.320 --> 22:55.753
Here it is!

22:55.840 --> 22:58.638
You used to love that
when you were a lad.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.756
Have you had lots to eat?

23:00.840 --> 23:02.478
You're a good boy.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.073
Thanks for feeding us.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.197
Come on, then!
Bring those eggs. Come on.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.794
That man is a show—off.
If there are no eggs left, I'm going after him.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.678
Dan? What's wrong?

23:16.760 --> 23:19.149
Young Benedict got frightened.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.959
He told Gisborne's lot who took
the flour with him.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.951
Your boys?

23:24.040 --> 23:26.554
They've taken them
to Nottingham.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.518
— Robin...
— I will resolve this.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.194
I will talk to the Sheriff.
I promise.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.435
(Much)
Where is everybody?

24:28.240 --> 24:30.800
Funny.
Wednesday used to be market day.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.393
I think Wednesday
may still be market day.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.031
Surely some mistake.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.151
(Man laughing)

24:48.680 --> 24:50.910
My Lord, I do not think that
this is a laughing matter.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.117
Sorry, remind me,
how many men do you have?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.838
Twenty four.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.115
— And he has?
— One.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.918
— But the point...
— But you let him take the house.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.754
— Technically it is still his property.
— La—Ia—Ia—di—da.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.831
( Continues laughing)

25:07.920 --> 25:10.798
I would have appreciated more
support in this matter.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.314
Relax. Relax.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.630
I'll get it back to you
within a month.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.355
Twenty four... One!

25:38.240 --> 25:42.472
It has been a good month.
We have collected nearly 300 pounds.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.312
Shh!

25:45.440 --> 25:48.830
Would you want to be
the King in Antioch?

25:48.920 --> 25:51.195
Clue. No.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.794
Trying to feed a starving army
on 300 pounds?

25:53.880 --> 25:57.031
You promised...
500 pounds.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.350
It's more than
we have managed before.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.635
Oh, yippee.

26:01.720 --> 26:06.919
So the King is starving in the Holy Land
and you have failed him, but...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.230
"it's more than
we ever managed before"!

26:09.320 --> 26:10.958
Robin of Locksley!

26:11.040 --> 26:12.996
(Rob/n)
Good morning, everyone.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.195
Sheriff.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.918
Carry on.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.989
Locksley. Welcome back.
I trust Sir Guy of Gisborne

26:24.080 --> 26:25.911
has managed your estates
to your satisfaction?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.117
I believe he may have managed
them to your satisfaction.

26:29.200 --> 26:34.991
Some of your peasants are unruly, by the way.
We have two in custody awaiting punishment.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.308
— Three.
— Three.

26:36.400 --> 26:40.154
Discipline will be a problem.
Be warned. Loughborough?

26:40.240 --> 26:42.151
Sheriff, thank you.
I report...

26:42.240 --> 26:45.357
Discipline has never been
a problem on my estates.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.830
— Times have changed.
— Not for the better, it seems.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.355
You of all people should know
that the King needs funds to fight our Holy War.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.750
Is it our Holy War?
Or is it Pope Gregory's?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.274
We stand shoulder to shoulder
with Rome.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.796
We fall shoulder to shoulder too.
I have seen it.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.348
Then what is your proposal
to raise money?

27:06.440 --> 27:09.238
Stop all taxes.
Today!

27:10.400 --> 27:13.676
— Amusing.
— I do not joke.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.437
Today is market day
and yet there is no market.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.590
And your point is?

27:19.680 --> 27:23.389
If a man can make more than he needs
for his family,

27:23.480 --> 27:27.234
he can take what remains to market.
He can trade.

27:27.320 --> 27:32.189
And the shire can take its share.
But until then we must help every man,

27:32.280 --> 27:36.637
every peasant, every pieman, every pinner,
provide for his family.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.790
Get him trading again.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.752
A man...

27:45.760 --> 27:51.915
who can provide for his family
is a comfortable man. A lazy man.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.436
Doesn't want to work.
What we need are hungry men.

27:55.520 --> 28:02.232
Our noble friend seems to forget
that hungry men are virtuous.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.153
There is a celebration of my return
in the Great Hall.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.309
Indeed.

28:06.400 --> 28:10.598
And I trust none of us virtuous men
will be feasting.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.196
(Bird twittering)

28:38.800 --> 28:40.358
( Crunching )

28:44.760 --> 28:47.513
My father seems to think
he should see you.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.672
Our house is watched.
Come after midnight tonight.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.318
Very well.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.836
You're looking...
striking.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.309
And if you still live with your father,
that must mean...

28:58.400 --> 29:02.075
— Take care not to be seen.
— Don't worry. I can look after myself.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.038
I don't care about you.
I care about my father.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.759
Are you really as naive
as you seem?

29:07.840 --> 29:11.276
You think you can pick fights
with these people and get away with it.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.874
You think you can slight them
in public?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.473
You're a fool.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.994
Marian, wait.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.799
Now is not the time,
I know,

29:20.880 --> 29:23.348
but I must say, you are...

29:24.840 --> 29:31.916
more than ever, your eyes,
even when you look at me in anger,

29:32.000 --> 29:33.513
I feel you.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.870
I believe you can still...

29:39.520 --> 29:41.556
even after all this time...

29:43.280 --> 29:45.748
you can see into my soul.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.799
Five years and you're still
peddling the same old drivel?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.233
Does it ever work?

29:53.320 --> 29:56.039
— You'd be surprised.
— Amazed.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.676
Bring out the Locksley lot.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.830
(Prisoner)
Hey, jailer!

30:24.920 --> 30:26.797
jailer? That's me!

30:26.880 --> 30:29.110
Jailer! Aren't you listening?

30:29.200 --> 30:31.111
I'm from Locksley!

30:31.200 --> 30:33.668
Jailer!
I'm from Locksley!

30:43.440 --> 30:45.317
Give your names.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.229
Will and Luke Scarlett.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.153
— What is your crime?
— Living in the wrong place at the wrong time.

30:51.240 --> 30:56.075
Living under an evil Sheriff. Our taxes go
to Nottingham, to the Sheriff, to his birds...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.639
— Name?
— Benedict.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.280
Son of Richard Giddens,
serf of Locksley.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.828
— What is your crime?
— Stealing flour.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.036
Are you guilty?

31:08.120 --> 31:10.509
— What is your punishment?
— Don't know.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.999
Hanging?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.150
— No, surely not!
— What?

31:16.240 --> 31:18.515
— Hanging?
— Robin...

31:18.600 --> 31:21.194
— No!
— They told me you'd save us!

31:21.280 --> 31:23.157
My dad told me
you'd save us!

31:26.920 --> 31:30.151
Do you mind?
We don't tell 'em if it's the dangle.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.949
— They kick up a hell of a stink.
— For stealing flour. Hanging?

31:34.040 --> 31:36.349
The Sheriff wants an example.
We've just had word...

31:36.440 --> 31:38.795
I'll be speaking to the Sheriff.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.751
Meanwhile you treat these prisoners well
or you'll have me to answer to.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.195
— (Door opens)
— You've got one more.

31:51.960 --> 31:56.795
— You're not from Locksley.
— I know. But you saved me once before.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.394
That was a long way from Nottingham.
Here I am known.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.313
Look, you're saving those others,
you'll save me.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.516
For my wife.
My newborn babe.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.751
— You said your wife was expecting.
— No, she had it.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.910
Your lies today
may be your undoing.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.879
I cannot save the others
and now I fear you will share their fate.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.916
What fate?

32:20.280 --> 32:22.191
I'm not from Locksley.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.838
Did I say Locksley?

32:23.920 --> 32:26.480
There's been a mistake here.
I'm from Rochdale.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.233
Rochdale!
That's why they call me Allan A Dale!

32:29.320 --> 32:31.709
Yeah, and I'm
from wild Wales!

32:31.800 --> 32:34.155
(Jailer)
Throw him in with the Locksley lot!

32:34.240 --> 32:36.674
(Chatter)

32:41.080 --> 32:44.629
Ah, Huntingdon,
you're missing your own feast.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.755
— Rumours abound.
— What rumours?

32:47.840 --> 32:52.197
That you are weak. That you've returned
weakened from your exertions in the Holy Land.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.238
My master returns with honours
from the King.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.478
The greater honour would have been
to have stood and fought with him, surely?

33:00.560 --> 33:04.758
I have visited my peasants in your dungeons.
They have committed grave crimes.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.274
— Master...
— Which would make much more compassionate

33:07.360 --> 33:10.511
— your gesture of pardoning them.
— Pardoning them?

33:11.600 --> 33:13.830
I will see them hang.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.796
In the morning, you yourself said
that we risk rebellion. We must have order.

33:17.880 --> 33:21.714
It is custom for the Sheriff
to hear his nobles' requests for clemency.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.870
La—di—da—di—da.

33:24.760 --> 33:29.311
By the way, in your absence we nominated
you to oversee tomorrow's entertainment.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.797
— No.
— Oh.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.633
You don't want these rumours of weakness
to spread, hm?

33:34.720 --> 33:36.915
Better scotch them now,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.150
otherwise we'll all pay.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.352
Marian! Mightl have
the pleasure of your company?

34:04.760 --> 34:06.751
(Knock on door)

34:12.000 --> 34:13.911
Well?
Don't just stand there.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.752
— If the Sheriff's men see...
— What?

34:15.840 --> 34:18.195
You might give them
the pleasure of your company?

34:18.280 --> 34:19.872
Grow up.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.032
Forgive me.
I could not welcome you before.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.272
— How did this monster become Sheriff?
— I did not watch my back.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.920
Prince John gives out the shires
in his brother's absence.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.831
My bid was not accepted.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.388
— What can be done?
— I can do nothing.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.233
I am watched.
And I must think of my daughter.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.028
When I do speak out,
no one listens.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.792
Robin, it is down to you,
my friend.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.838
— What can we do?
— Play Nottingham's game.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.480
Speak to the lords.
Slowly you can turn them.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.711
Do not make the mistake I and others
have made and make your dissent public.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.075
Consolidate
your position quietly.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.513
I do not have time.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.273
Tomorrow I am to order the hanging
of four of my own peasants.

35:00.680 --> 35:04.559
— It will be the long game, I'm afraid.
— Will and Luke Scarlett cannot wait.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.312
Benedict Giddens.
Allan A. Dale.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.791
You must let them die. It is a test.
Fail it and there will be consequences.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.279
— Perhaps!
— Definitely!

35:12.360 --> 35:14.351
This is not a game...

35:14.440 --> 35:17.273
My daughter speaks when she should not.
But she is right.

35:17.360 --> 35:22.639
You have no choice, Robin.
Hide your temper. Bide your time.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.234
Until you can act decisively.

35:25.320 --> 35:28.630
Or kiss your lands,
if not your life, goodbye.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.555
— Murderer!
— Murderer!

36:18.760 --> 36:20.591
Robin.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.636
It's not your fault.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.356
Lords, ladies,
people of Nottingham...

36:38.440 --> 36:41.671
we are gathered here today
to witness the carrying out of justice

36:41.760 --> 36:45.070
in the name of God
and King Richard.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.310
Bring out the prisoners!

36:52.360 --> 36:54.635
Robin of Locksley,
Earl of Huntingdon,

36:54.720 --> 36:57.029
having recently returned
from the Holy War

36:57.120 --> 37:02.399
with a personal commendation from the King
himself, will read the proclamation.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.155
Enjoy.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.359
Oh, and no second thoughts,
Locksley,

37:10.440 --> 37:14.433
or your friend Much will be dropping in
on us as our special guest today.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.190
"Let it be heard and known

37:25.280 --> 37:30.752
"about the lands and realms of Richard,
His Majesty, King of England,

37:30.840 --> 37:34.389
"that on this,
the 26th day of April,

37:34.480 --> 37:38.109
"in the year of our Lord
eleven hundred and ninety—two,

37:38.200 --> 37:43.797
"the following men, having been tried
under law and found guilty —

37:43.880 --> 37:46.553
"Benedict Giddens of Locksley...

37:47.160 --> 37:49.754
"Will Scarlett of Locksley...

37:49.840 --> 37:52.070
"Luke Scarlett of Locksley...

37:52.160 --> 37:54.355
"Allan A. Dale of Locksley.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.718
"These same men have been
sentenced to hang by a rope..."

37:58.800 --> 38:01.155
"until they are dead."

38:03.000 --> 38:04.558
(Crowd groaning)

38:07.280 --> 38:10.033
(Man) Will! Luke!

38:15.080 --> 38:17.150
— May the...
— Wait!

38:17.680 --> 38:18.954
Nah nah nah...

38:19.040 --> 38:24.114
"Please don't kill my brother,
my little baby, my inbred cousin!"

38:24.200 --> 38:28.910
On behalf of Anthony, our bishop,
I claim benefit of clergy for these men.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.274
They cannot hang.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.396
These are not holy men.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.199
These people cannot plead the cloth.
Get on with it.

38:35.280 --> 38:38.636
I came last night
to administer their last rites.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.636
— So?
— And each one came to God through me,

38:43.720 --> 38:46.996
repenting their sins
and asking to take the cloth.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.071
I felt duty—bound
to consult the Bishop

38:49.160 --> 38:53.597
and he in turn confers
status of novice onto each man.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.113
Shut up.

38:56.320 --> 39:01.678
"I, Anthony, very Reverend Vicar Apostolic,
hereby confer..."

39:01.760 --> 39:03.318
Shut up!

39:04.440 --> 39:07.989
— Is this possible?
— They can't have become novices overnight.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.870
They are become postulants!
Novice novices, if you like.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.475
And so are under the protection
of the Church.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.758
Novice novices?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.876
How novel.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.679
Well...
hang them and arrest him.

39:39.440 --> 39:43.718
Where's the drum?
Pom, pom...pom...

39:47.160 --> 39:49.913
Watch and enjoy, Robin.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.673
Oh, your priest will talk.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.149
And then you will be done for,
my friend.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.435
( Drumming speeds up )

39:58.840 --> 40:02.515
May the souls of these men
find forgiveness in heaven.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.349
(Crowd gasps)

40:08.480 --> 40:10.471
(Man)
I love you, boys!

40:10.560 --> 40:14.235
I love you, Will!
Love you, Luke!

40:14.320 --> 40:16.436
I'll see you in heaven!

40:28.200 --> 40:29.758
People of Nottingham.

40:36.120 --> 40:39.829
These men have committed no crime
worth more than a spell in the stocks.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.871
Will you tolerate
this injustice?

40:47.960 --> 40:50.428
I for one will not.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.553
This way!

41:05.120 --> 41:06.519
Master! Help!

41:08.520 --> 41:11.512
Yield, Locksley, or say farewell
to your little Mulch.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.068
His name... is Much.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.355
Well, he'll be mulch
in a moment.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.712
Let's go.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.274
Master! Look out!

42:01.960 --> 42:03.234
Robin!

42:03.320 --> 42:04.673
This way!

42:06.320 --> 42:08.436
Don't just stand there!
Get after him!

42:10.920 --> 42:12.592
Prepare to return to Locksley.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.034
This time for good.

42:25.160 --> 42:28.072
Master!
Archers, what do we do?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.558
Let's give them something
to shoot at.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.993
Go, go!

42:36.680 --> 42:38.113
VVhaa!

43:06.600 --> 43:08.955
I'm just getting
some kindling.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.197
Be honest with me.

43:18.320 --> 43:21.278
This does not bode well
for my lodge.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.196
My Bonchurch.

43:30.280 --> 43:34.398
— I knew it.
— This is your lodge now, my friend.

43:34.480 --> 43:37.233
— Sherwood Lodge!
— I'm not your friend.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.112
Shh.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.834
(Man)
Excuse me!

43:50.400 --> 43:52.277
This is our forest.
