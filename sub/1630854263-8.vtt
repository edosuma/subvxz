WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:07.308
I'm telling you,
Dave, you are gonna

00:07.408 --> 00:08.976
love this place, man.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.245
Elmo's is crab cake heaven.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.513
Well, not for the crabs.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.015
Okay, what did
we agree

00:15.116 --> 00:16.984
about you
saying things?

00:17.085 --> 00:18.786
"Don't say things."

00:20.654 --> 00:23.091
Elmo's is not just
another restaurant,

00:23.191 --> 00:24.958
it's a Pasadena institution.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.360
Well, why haven't I heard of it?

00:26.460 --> 00:29.163
Because we don't want
tourists to ruin it.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.898
It's for locals only.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.335
I'm finally a local.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.405
Eh-eh...

00:39.840 --> 00:41.742
What the hell?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.478
(dogs barking)

00:44.578 --> 00:46.780
Welcome to Doggy Howser's.
How can I help you today?

00:46.880 --> 00:50.151
Yeah, you can tell me what
the hell happened to Elmo's.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.952
Who's Elmo?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.922
Elmo's made the best
crab cakes in town,

00:55.022 --> 00:57.158
and it was right here.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.559
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't help you,

00:58.659 --> 01:01.329
but sometimes
old, sad places close

01:01.429 --> 01:03.364
and become new fun things.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.969
So... this is a pet shop now?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.404
It's a pet spa.

01:10.504 --> 01:14.575
(chuckles)
A pet spa is not a thing.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.677
Well, fur babies
need pampering, too.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.880
Our special this month
is a blueberry facial.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.450
Good Lord.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.052
Is that dog in a bathrobe?

01:26.387 --> 01:28.122
He's just out of
the cold plunge.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.957
Ah.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.426
That is adorable.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.828
I can't believe it, man.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.997
Elmo's is gone.
Just like that.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.833
Well, we've been here
for two years.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.436
Two years? Calvin,
I thought you said

01:42.536 --> 01:43.937
you were
a regular at Elmo's.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.273
Well, I was a regular,

01:45.373 --> 01:47.074
but I wasn't
a regular regular.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.745
Lady, it's a dog.
Let it walk.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.285
Come on, Dave.
We're out of here.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.453
Would you like a blueberry?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.088
Ooh, love one.
Don't you dare.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.592
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

02:04.692 --> 02:06.093
* Welcome to the hood. *

02:11.299 --> 02:12.700
It's not right.
Elmo's was a beloved

02:12.800 --> 02:13.834
neighborhood institution.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.269
Yeah, but when was the last time

02:15.369 --> 02:16.970
you actually ate there, Pop?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.373
I shouldn't have to eat
crab cakes every day

02:19.473 --> 02:22.276
to keep a place from closing.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.346
I just hate that we're losing
all of our small businesses.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.648
Ah, thanks, Mo.
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.319
You see that, Dave?
You're part of the problem.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.922
Ordering stuff online is killing
all the local businesses.

02:35.022 --> 02:38.091
Hmm. You know what,
you're right.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.228
Oh, no, please.
You can't stop progress, Pop.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.196
Like when you told me
to stop growing

02:42.296 --> 02:44.265
so you didn't have to
buy me pants.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.636
Hey, guys.
Hey, Malcolm.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.504
I bought you some tube socks.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.840
Mom, I'm a grown man,
I don't need you to...

02:52.940 --> 02:55.343
Wow, these are soft.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.678
What is all this?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.947
Oh, we went to Cost Warehouse
for a few things

03:00.047 --> 03:02.149
and bought a few other things.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.052
Oh, uh, maybe make
two trips, sweetie.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.089
See, we didn't
used to have to drive

03:09.189 --> 03:11.492
all the way across town
to a store

03:11.592 --> 03:14.962
the size of a football stadium
to buy stuff.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.931
We used to get
everything we needed locally,

03:18.031 --> 03:21.068
right here at
Mr. Friendly's Bargain Mart.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.437
Oh, that place
on Orange Grove

03:23.537 --> 03:25.138
with the cute
little kitty.
Mm-hmm.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.407
Mr. Friendly's?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.776
Yeah, Mr. Friendly's
had character.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.744
I used to take the boys there
when they were younger

03:30.844 --> 03:34.147
for ice cream sundaes,
back to school clothes.

03:34.248 --> 03:37.651
Marty would sit and read
the magazines for hours.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.220
GROVER:
Can someone please get the door?

03:40.321 --> 03:43.424
You know, it's a shame
Wanda's Beauty Supply closed.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.193
You know, my edges
haven't been the same since.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.661
If we're not careful,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.062
Friendly's is going to be
the next one to go.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.632
My fingers are numb!

03:52.833 --> 03:55.969
You know what we should do
is get people to understand

03:56.069 --> 03:57.871
that they can get
anything they want

03:57.971 --> 04:00.874
right here in this
neighborhood on Orange Grove.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.576
Starting with Friendly's,

04:02.676 --> 04:05.746
then the Tip-Top Pharmacy,
Cavanaugh's Sporting Goods,

04:05.846 --> 04:10.318
even that dry cleaner's that's
only open from 12:00 to 2:00.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.054
Let's do it.
No more big box stores.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.689
No more shopping
online either.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.858
Right, Gemma?

04:17.958 --> 04:21.094
Oh, uh, uh, yeah.
I'm in.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.563
Less shopping online.

04:22.663 --> 04:26.133
No... No.
No shopping online.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.102
Absolutely.
Unless it's much cheaper.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.804
Or I'm really busy,
or it's super cute,

04:30.904 --> 04:32.573
or I'm too tired
to drive.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.877
No... Gemma, I don't think
you know what's at stake here.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.813
We are locals now.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.350
ALL:
Eh...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.619
Hey. Hey,
y'all know that new

04:45.719 --> 04:47.555
Mexican-Japanese
rice ice cream chain?

04:47.655 --> 04:50.123
Mucho Mochi?
Your boy got some.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.695
That's not local.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.732
I was on a wait list for those.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.105
Maybe it's not so bad.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.576
Hey... Oh, damn.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.846
My eyes are burning.
What is that terrible smell?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.448
Is it that awful?

05:14.548 --> 05:17.284
You might have to leave
your couch outside for a week.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.187
Is this why
you texted me?

05:20.287 --> 05:22.523
Yes. I need help.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.692
I'm a disaster in the kitchen.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.059
Okay, okay.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.528
So, just walk me
through what you did.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.329
Well, I followed
this recipe,

05:29.430 --> 05:31.765
and it said put in
four cloves of garlic.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.767
Honey, that's a bulb.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.407
This is a clove.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.676
How do you know that?

05:42.776 --> 05:45.746
How do you not know that?

05:46.647 --> 05:49.450
(groans)
Because I'm hopeless, okay?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.885
And Marty,
he loves your lasagna.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.455
I just wanted to make
something special for him.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.590
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.160
This week, I'm going to
teach you how to make lasagna.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.530
Oh, I couldn't
ask you to do that.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.666
Oh, no, you don't have to ask.
You're family now.

06:05.766 --> 06:09.169
But first, we need to
throw this thing out.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.538
Not in the garbage.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.473
Mm-hmm.
Put it in your trunk.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.442
Mm-hmm.
Drive to Riverside.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.878
And then drive with
the trunk open.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.813
All right.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.016
(doorbell rings)

06:23.116 --> 06:24.718
Oh.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.721
Hey-hey.
Delivery. I need a signature.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.490
Okay. I'm not
expecting anything...

06:29.590 --> 06:31.559
That's okay. It's fine.
Just sign.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.328
Gemma, what's going on?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.364
It's fine. It's for me.
But it came here.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.966
I must have screwed up
the addresses.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.269
Thank you... for your service.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.540
Uh, Gemma,
you accidentally

06:46.640 --> 06:48.476
had a package
sent to my house?

06:48.576 --> 06:50.578
(laughs) Crazy, right?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.179
It's so embarrassing.
What a goof.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.447
It's like...
It's like when you're a kid

06:53.547 --> 06:55.315
and you call
the teacher "Mommy."

06:56.517 --> 06:58.385
It's almost nothing like that.

06:58.486 --> 07:02.222
(sighs) Okay,
I ordered some things online,

07:02.322 --> 07:03.891
and I don't want Dave to know.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.094
Oh, right, because
of the whole "buy local" thing.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.831
Yes, but shipping is free
and it comes the next day.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.667
I'm so ashamed.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.803
Can it be our secret?
Oh, Gemma, I don't know...

07:15.903 --> 07:17.270
It's no big deal.
Everybody does it.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.339
I feel so dirty.
It's not you, it's me.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.544
Who said it was me?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.482
Oh, this place is charming.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.318
Oh, look, they have
an old-fashioned soda fountain.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.353
(chuckles)
This place hasn't changed a bit.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.424
Oh, good Lord, is that
the cute orange cat?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.393
Can I pet you,
little kitty?

07:40.494 --> 07:41.595
(cat hisses)
Oh!

07:41.695 --> 07:44.431
(chuckles)
No, I can't.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.504
Oh, hello, sir.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.072
Uh, I don't know
if you remember me,

07:52.172 --> 07:53.406
but I'm Calvin Butler.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.843
I don't take any bills
bigger than a 20.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.210
You see that?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.712
So down-to-earth.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.480
And none of that
Apple Pay garbage.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.415
The kids think because
they point their phone

08:02.516 --> 08:04.652
at my register, I get my money.
(blows raspberry)

08:06.219 --> 08:07.588
Trust me, I agree with you.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.023
No, but we are here
to put these signs

08:10.123 --> 08:13.226
in people's windows to encourage
customers to shop local.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.461
There's no room.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.830
Well, maybe we can take down

08:16.930 --> 08:20.968
that Billy Dee Williams
Colt 45 poster from 1989.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.371
Excuse me, sir,
do you have any shallots?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.039
Use an onion. Same thing.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.775
Do you have any onions?

08:27.875 --> 08:29.910
No.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.380
Sir, it's gonna be great.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.783
We are encouraging people
to shop local

08:35.883 --> 08:38.418
to support local businesses
like yourself.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.220
I mean, we've got petitions,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.790
we're doing social media.
It's going to be fantastic.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.025
Okay, how much
is this gonna cost me?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.159
It's free.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.561
Go crazy.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.566
Is that hair?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.067
Ew, yup.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.703
That is a bag of human hair.

08:55.803 --> 08:59.840
So I take it that's
the hair-slash-pastry section?

09:02.843 --> 09:05.913
See there? (chuckles)
You can get everything here.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.784
Baby, I can't find
anything on my list.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.519
Well, I found
everything on mine.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.888
Got orange juice,
paper plates,

09:14.988 --> 09:18.558
even found a pack
of batteries, size "B."

09:18.659 --> 09:21.695
I've never heard
of "B" batteries.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.531
And you call yourself
a scientist.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.570
Baby, this orange juice
is $11.99.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.640
(clears throat)

09:32.740 --> 09:34.942
And a price I am happy to pay

09:35.042 --> 09:37.077
because the money
stays in the community.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.178
Mm-hmm.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.914
I live in Tarzana.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.286
Hey, Calvin, uh,
are we sure this place

09:46.386 --> 09:47.788
should be at the top
of our "save" list?

09:47.888 --> 09:51.825
Or, I don't know,
even on it?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.360
Yes, Dave.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.829
This guy is a small
business owner like myself.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.131
If we don't support him,
how do I expect

09:58.231 --> 09:59.466
people to support me?

09:59.566 --> 10:03.370
Hey, I remember you.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.905
You're little Marty Butler.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.306
Oh, yes I am.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.043
Yeah, you used to look at
the ladies in the Cosmo.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.748
(nervous laugh)
Well, I-I-I don't... I don't...

10:14.848 --> 10:16.416
I don't think that was me.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.219
Yeah, I know it was you,
you little freak.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.823
What part of "banned for life"
don't you understand?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.861
Really, Marty? Cosmo?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
If you would've just
looked in the shoebox

10:30.063 --> 10:33.133
in the back of my closet,
you would've found a gold mine.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.405
(knock on door)

10:38.505 --> 10:40.808
Are we alone?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.877
Yes, we are alone.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.979
I assume you're here
for your box.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.547
Thank you, Malcolm.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.817
I know this
isn't right.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.218
I cannot believe
I have to say this,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.653
but, Gemma, we have got to
stop meeting like this.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.522
Don't you think I know that?

10:55.622 --> 10:58.859
This isn't us.
This isn't who we are.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.128
What you mean "we"?
You promised Dave...

11:01.228 --> 11:04.597
I know what I promised Dave.
But I have needs.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.702
Ooh, good, a Waterpik.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.605
Doing all this
for a Waterpik?

11:12.706 --> 11:16.543
It was 30% off, and gum
disease runs in my family.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.781
I've got to get home
before Dave notices I'm gone.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.518
You know, you could
at least stay for coffee!

11:31.158 --> 11:34.127
Hi, I'm Calvin Butler
of Calvin's Pit Stop,

11:34.227 --> 11:37.297
and I'm here at Friendly's
Market, keeping it local,

11:37.397 --> 11:41.401
just one of the businesses
we need to rally behind.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.570
And this ice cream is delish.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.275
Hey. Hey,
no unaccompanied minors. Out.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.811
Oh, Mr. Friendly, he's with us.
Cut, Grover.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.079
Yeah, Mr. Friendly,

11:52.179 --> 11:53.814
Grover is making
a video about your store,

11:53.914 --> 11:57.050
that he is going to blast off
to his hundreds of followers.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.451
58,000.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.421
I'm still not capable
of processing that.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.791
Look, we got it, okay?
Go ahead, Grover. Roll it.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.158
Here we go.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.861
Do you remember the days
of the corner store?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.997
Well, Friendly Markets does.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.499
Look at this
Christmas-themed menorah.

12:12.599 --> 12:17.537
Yes, and these:
100 live lady bugs.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.473
They're sleeping.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.076
GROVER:
Hey, kitty.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.112
Look, he's lounging
where they keep the meat.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.379
CALVIN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.747
Grover, don't-don't film that.

12:27.848 --> 12:31.084
Shoo, kitty. Get out.
Go on. Go on, now.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.387
This place
has history and charm,

12:34.487 --> 12:37.024
and if we don't support it,
we'll just end up

12:37.124 --> 12:41.261
with another Chipotle
or Mucho Mochi on this corner.

12:41.361 --> 12:45.232
So come on down and support
all the local businesses

12:45.332 --> 12:47.000
right here on Orange Grove.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.136
Right, Mr. Friendly?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.171
Wha...

12:51.271 --> 12:52.705
I don't want any trouble.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.678
Okay, so your
noodles are on,

12:58.778 --> 13:00.747
and you are ready
to start making lasagna,

13:00.848 --> 13:02.349
the layer cake of pasta.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.017
Mmm.
All right.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.718
Let's start with
the mozzarella.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.920
How much?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.655
Not too much, but enough.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.425
Uh-huh. Now let's
add some Parmesan.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.560
How much?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.028
Mmm, just enough.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.031
Ah, yes.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.799
Okay, now add a little nutmeg.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.369
Eh, a little more.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.237
Eh, just
a little more, you know.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.206
You don't have to
be scared of it.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.707
But don't overdo it!

13:29.242 --> 13:31.678
Don't overdo it.
Okay, here, let me show you.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.381
See? Boop, boop.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.949
You don't use a cookbook?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.550
Nope, it's all up in here.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.954
Okay, now,
let's add a plop of

13:41.054 --> 13:42.289
(Italian accent):
ricotta.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.125
How much is a plop?
Two dollops.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.531
Let me show you. Just...
Okay.

13:51.631 --> 13:55.635
(timer dings)
Oh, looks like
our pasta is ready.

13:55.735 --> 13:56.970
All right. Okay.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.139
Excuse me, excuse me.
Very hot, very hot.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.474
Coming through,
coming through. Okay.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.077
Oh, whoa. Look at that texture.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.879
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
You see that?

14:05.979 --> 14:08.015
Oh, wait a minute,
I need an egg.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.017
Okay, let me get an egg, please.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.886
I've got an egg right here.
Okay, now all we...

14:12.986 --> 14:16.789
Meat sauce looks like
it's almost ready. Okay.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.092
All we need to do
is add oil to the pan,

14:19.192 --> 14:20.593
and we are cooking.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.861
Yes, we are.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.297
Oh, gosh,
thank you so much.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.366
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.669
You guys should've
seen it.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.005
The Friendly Market
was thriving.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.206
Oh, that's great.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.841
Yeah, my man Grover

14:34.942 --> 14:36.143
posted the videos he made,

14:36.243 --> 14:37.677
and they are blowing up.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.280
Oh, yeah. You know
the old orange cat?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.915
People are going crazy
for the one of him

14:42.015 --> 14:43.216
sleeping in
the deli case.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.518
They're calling him
"Cold Cut Cat."

14:45.618 --> 14:46.553
(laughs)

14:46.653 --> 14:47.620
GROVER:
It's huge.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.289
I've almost got as many likes

14:49.389 --> 14:51.758
as the least popular guy in BTS.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.495
Hipsters were lined up
to take a selfie with the cat.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.265
One of them got
Mr. Friendly to smile,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.900
and he was not happy about it.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.870
Dinner is served.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.038
(all exclaiming happily)

15:05.138 --> 15:06.673
GEMMA:
Oh, this smells good.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.110
Yes, my beautiful,
talented fiancée

15:10.210 --> 15:12.312
has made her
first lasagna.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.714
And she did it all by herself.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.352
Mmm.
Mmm.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.921
Um, this is
incredible, Necie.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.723
Mm-hmm.
Oh, thanks.

15:23.823 --> 15:24.824
This is amazing.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.858
I mean, this tastes

15:25.959 --> 15:27.327
just like my mama makes.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.297
Mama, you the champ,

15:30.397 --> 15:32.099
but Necie could give you
some tips, girl.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.034
(laughs)

15:34.134 --> 15:36.603
No, I can't.
I didn't make it.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.939
Miss Tina made it.
I didn't do anything.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.309
No, no, no.
You preheated the oven.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.611
That's the most important
20 minutes.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.047
Marty, I can't cook.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.649
I made a lasagna,
I had to drive it to the dump.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.485
No, no, no, no.
It's okay, babe.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.755
You know my two favorite things
are you and takeout.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.325
(doorbell rings)

16:01.094 --> 16:03.496
Oh, of course.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.433
Malcolm?
Huh?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.468
Are you ordering stuff online?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.937
Uh, apparently.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.441
Uh, yes, yes. I ordered this.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.143
I broke the pledge.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.512
I was weak, but now, Father,
I have learned my lesson,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.048
so I'd rather
forget about it and move on.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.249
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.252
Wow.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.355
You broke the pledge.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.823
It be your own people.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.692
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.861
My salad's getting cold.
(nervous chuckle)

16:36.296 --> 16:37.197
Well, hold on, honey.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.898
What's going on?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.467
Malcolm got a box.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.769
Let's not make
a federal case of it.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.440
Okay, well, Malcolm...

16:47.540 --> 16:49.276
why don't you open it?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.878
Uh, I would
rather not, Dave.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.647
I said open it.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.750
Yeah, what is it?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.753
Uh...
That's a good
question, Calvin.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.291
Malcolm,
what is it?

17:04.391 --> 17:05.992
Leave him alone!
Uh, it is...

17:07.927 --> 17:10.863
It is obviously a...

17:10.963 --> 17:14.334
gold mini rock
roller thing, Dave.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.035
Ha.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.039
Huh. Use it.
Huh?

17:21.308 --> 17:23.743
Well, Malcolm, you ordered it.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.478
Use it.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.055
I knew it!

17:39.292 --> 17:40.927
Look, will you just
tell him, Gemma?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.963
I ordered it, okay?
It's a jade facial roller.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.167
It reduces fine lines
and puffiness.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.369
I never meant to hurt you.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.540
My wife
and my best friend's son.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.776
I can't believe
you'd do me like this.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.745
Wait a minute.
I'm the victim here.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.381
I'm the one who got used.
Look, Pop, back me up on this.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.049
Shame on you, Malcolm.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.919
Shame, shame, shame.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.294
Mr. Friendly, what's going on?
Where are the crowds?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.928
We're closed. Permanently.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.231
What? What happened?
The place was mobbed.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.500
Thousands of people
must have seen that cat video.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.735
Heh. Well, so did
the health department.

18:22.835 --> 18:26.105
All of a sudden, you can't let
your cat sleep in the deli case?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.875
Well, uh... you could
never do that.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.844
No, but you can give a dog
a blueberry facial.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.013
What kind of world is this?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.583
We're sorry, Mr. Friendly.
We were just trying to help.

18:36.683 --> 18:37.950
Well, you did.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.852
Some young women
from the west side came over

18:39.952 --> 18:41.654
after they saw the video, and
they want to lease the place.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.758
They're turning it into
something called Mucho Mochi.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.327
Damn it.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.330
Another neighborhood
classic, just gone.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.098
I can't believe
you're not upset.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.201
Why would I be?
I own the building.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.069
I just ran the store
'cause I'm a people person.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.039
BOTH:
Eh...

19:00.139 --> 19:01.474
Well, since we're closed,

19:01.574 --> 19:03.042
help yourself
to whatever you want.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.977
Hey, take some salami.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.481
Nah.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.717
I don't want to wake up the cat.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.426
Hurry up, Calvin.
We're hungry.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.993
Okay, babe, where we going?

19:21.093 --> 19:22.662
Akbar's Lobster Pot.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.131
Akbar is so grateful to you
for supporting his restaurant

19:25.232 --> 19:27.467
with your campaign,
he is comping dinner.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.035
Well, all right.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.305
Comped is how
I like my lobster.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.241
Ooh, and this afternoon,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
I bought some yarn
at Donna's Yarn Barn.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.712
Wrong color, overpriced,
but fighting the good fight.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.015
You know, I've never
been prouder of you.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.851
Really?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.255
Master's degree? Childbirth?

19:48.355 --> 19:51.224
Okay. All right,
all right, let's go.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.959
All right. Oh, let me
just lock up real quick.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.294
Okay.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.932
Excuse me, are you
Calvin Butler?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.334
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We're closing up.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.636
Jake Walker.
Thaxton Capital Partners.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.273
We'd like to make you an offer
to buy out your property.

20:06.373 --> 20:10.142
What? Sorry, but, uh,
it's not for sale.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.445
It's a very generous offer.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.381
I don't care how generous it is.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.215
Like I said, I'm not interested.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.517
Now if you'll excuse me,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.352
I have a date
with a free lobster.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.120
Why don't you
look at the offer?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.889
You could be eating
lobster every day

20:22.989 --> 20:24.891
for the rest
of your life.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.059
I don't like lobster that much.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.297
If you change your mind,
the offer's in there.

20:31.097 --> 20:31.998
Good meeting you, Mr. Butler.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.266
(chuckles)

20:33.366 --> 20:35.435
Good luck with
the next sucker, sucker.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.008
Come on, Calvin.
I'm starving.

20:42.108 --> 20:45.878
Those lobsters aren't going to

20:47.380 --> 20:49.749
(scoffs) Nothing.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.117
Come on, girl.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.153
I'm gonna drip some butter
on your lobster tail.
