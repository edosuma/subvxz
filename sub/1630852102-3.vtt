NEWS REPORTER 3:
<i>Three bodies found on the same day.</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.444
The term serial killer
is a relatively new term.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.155
It was coined in the 1970s

00:30.238 --> 00:32.741
<i>because there were</i>
<i>so many murders happening</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:34.659
<i>across Los Angeles.</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:37.912
<i>The city of Los Angeles</i>
<i>may have a mass murderer on the loose.</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:40.915
TRACY PATTIN: <i>Before that,</i>
<i>it wasn't even on the radar.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:44.627
You'd have one body here,
and it would take two or three deaths

00:44.878 --> 00:46.379
<i>in different locations</i>
<i>before you got to the point</i>

00:46.796 --> 00:49.215
<i>of realizing we got a different</i>
<i>type of animal here.</i>

00:49.299 --> 00:51.718
This is a string,
and somebody is responsible.

00:52.260 --> 00:56.806
JOAN RENNER: <i>This serial killer thing</i>
<i>was a whole different paradigm for police.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:59.934
It's a miracle that they can even begin
to get a handle on it.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.480
MICHAEL CONNOLLY: <i>It was real</i>
<i>trial by fire by the LAPD detectives.</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:06.066
<i>They were kind of learning as they went.</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:08.693
They became detectives very
quick early in their careers,

01:08.777 --> 01:12.697
<i>and then they were placed on these cases</i>
<i>that are the most difficult there are.</i>

01:13.990 --> 01:17.202
<i>You have this clock,</i>
<i>this person that you're hunting</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:18.369
<i>is gonna do this again</i>

01:18.453 --> 01:19.621

PAUL HOLES: <i>After the</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:52.278
there was a lull, there was
nothing happening for a year.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.197
This is where the media starts
to pull away

01:54.280 --> 01:55.657

<i>Law enforcement disbands</i>

02:04.749 --> 02:06.417
Los Angeles detectives receive a call

that changed everything.

<i>Missing from where?</i>

02:16.261 --> 02:19.097
DAVID McEACHRAN:
<i>In 1979, Bellingham, it was small,</i>

02:19.180 --> 02:20.390
<i>it was very cohesive.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:26.646
Many people knew each other.
People had grown up here.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.108
Just very, very nice, very nice city.

02:31.901 --> 02:36.906
On the morning of January 12, 1979,

02:38.867 --> 02:42.120
<i>my supervisor handed me a case</i>

02:42.203 --> 02:46.833
and said this was a case
involving two missing girls...

02:47.709 --> 02:50.962
<i>Karen Mandic and Diane Wilder.</i>

02:52.881 --> 02:55.008
McEACHRAN: <i>Karen Mandic worked</i>
<i>at Fred Meyer's.</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:59.095
<i>She was a very reliable employee and had</i>
<i>talked to her supervisor</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:02.140
and wanted to have time off that evening

03:02.223 --> 03:04.058
for two hours, a long lunch break.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.560
She was given an opportunity

03:05.685 --> 03:08.146
to earn a little bit of extra money
by watching a house

03:08.229 --> 03:11.065
for somebody that she knew
who worked for a security company.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.359
The people were leaving
for a long weekend,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.612
and they wanted to have
their--their house checked.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.947
<i>This is the company that would be called.</i>

03:19.324 --> 03:22.410
JIM GEDDES: <i>She got to go and housesit.</i>

03:22.493 --> 03:26.289
For that, she was gonna earn
a hundred dollars.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.584
Karen was a little shy
of doing it on her own

03:29.667 --> 03:33.296
and asked if her roommate,
Diane Wilder, could accompany her.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.466
MURPHY: <i>She'd had a conversation</i>
<i>with her manager at work</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:38.885
<i>and said that she would be back</i>
<i>by 9:00 p.m.</i>

03:38.968 --> 03:40.470
When she didn't come back at 9:00 p.m.,

03:40.553 --> 03:43.598
her manager became worried,
so he called her boyfriend.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.685
They were reported missing
shortly after midnight

03:47.769 --> 03:49.103
by her boyfriend

03:49.187 --> 03:51.606
who said she hadn't shown up.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.274
She hadn't gone back to work.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.735
McEACHRAN:
<i>And usually missing person cases</i>

03:55.818 --> 03:58.321
<i>don't engender a great deal of concern.</i>

03:58.404 --> 04:01.324
<i>They happen really continually</i>
<i>and people turn up.</i>

04:01.407 --> 04:03.451
But this was such an unusual thing

04:03.534 --> 04:06.871
and, uh, Karen Mandic
was such a reliable person

04:06.955 --> 04:10.875
that the officers really thought
it was extremely serious.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.295
MURPHY: <i>Police called the owner</i>
<i>of Whatcom Security,</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:17.298
and he said that he would contact the guy
who handled that particular job.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.676
<i>A man named Kenneth Bianchi.</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:26.099
GEDDES: <i>I met with Kenneth Bianchi</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

04:26.182 --> 04:29.477
the morning after their disappearance.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.189
<i>He seemed to come as straightforward.</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:36.359
<i>"I have no idea</i>
<i>what you're talking about."</i>

04:37.151 --> 04:38.528
I asked him

04:38.611 --> 04:41.322
had he had recent contact
with Karen Mandic.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.157
He said no.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.662
I said, when was your
last contact with Karen Mandic?

04:47.745 --> 04:53.084
He says, I think it was in November
when I left Fred Meyer's employ.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.795
He also said that he was

04:55.920 --> 04:58.715
at a Sheriff's Reserve meeting
that evening,

04:58.798 --> 05:01.217
and he had joined or was trying to join

05:01.301 --> 05:03.678
the Whatcom County Sheriff's Reserve.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.098
And they found also he had not turned up
at the Reserve meeting.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.101
So, they talked to him again
and he admitted that well, yeah,

05:10.184 --> 05:11.602
he hadn't gone to the Reserve meeting,

05:11.686 --> 05:14.022
that he just needed time to drive around

05:14.105 --> 05:15.606
and to sort of clear his head.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.278
ROGER BOREN: <i>Most police officers know</i>
<i>they've got a guilty person on their hands</i>

05:20.361 --> 05:23.156
when they said, "I was out
driving or walking around

05:24.115 --> 05:25.408
clearing my head."

05:25.491 --> 05:28.244
<i>Ken Bianchi had no alibi</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:31.289
<i>for the night that Karen Mandic</i>
<i>and Diane Wilder went missing.</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:36.127
GEDDES: <i>Lieutenant Page and I</i>
<i>went to the parking lots</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:39.047
<i>for the hotels, motels, grocery stores</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:41.632
<i>looking for the girl's car.</i>

05:42.717 --> 05:45.136
<i>We came back to the station</i>

05:45.219 --> 05:46.512
<i>trying to figure out</i>

05:46.596 --> 05:49.432
<i>what part Bianchi was playing</i>
<i>in this case.</i>

05:49.515 --> 05:52.643
He's a person of interest in this case

05:52.727 --> 05:56.105
but until we get some more,

05:56.189 --> 05:58.066
<i>there's nothing we can do at that point.</i>

06:03.529 --> 06:06.949
BOREN: <i>Somebody reported</i>
<i>that Karen Mandic's hatchback car</i>

06:07.033 --> 06:11.079
had been found on a cul-de-sac
right off of Willow Street.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.831
Did we get over there really fast?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.124
Yeah, oh, boy.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.713
<i>I walked up to the car.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:23.925
<i>It has a very deserted look about it.</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:27.970
Nothing front seat, nothing backseat.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.307
<i>Come around the hatchback...</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.436
<i>there's the bodies of the girls.</i>

06:37.021 --> 06:39.690
Diane Wilder was face down.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.987
<i>Karen Mandic's face was toward the window.</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:48.157
It was just immediately obvious to me

06:49.075 --> 06:52.662
that there was no life left
in either of the girls.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.500
McEACHRAN:
<i>They were strangled with a ligature.</i>

06:57.583 --> 07:00.002
<i>You could see deep furrows on their necks.</i>

07:00.628 --> 07:01.838
It was just horrendous.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.382
These were two beautiful
young girls that had,

07:04.465 --> 07:06.342
had done nothing wrong at all.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.178
I got on the radio

07:09.262 --> 07:12.223
and requested an immediate pickup

07:12.306 --> 07:13.933
of Kenneth Bianchi.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.311
The police swarmed Whatcom Security Agency

07:17.395 --> 07:19.564
where Ken Bianchi
had been working that morning.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.608
<i>Well, when Bianchi drove up</i>

07:22.692 --> 07:25.153
<i>and got out and walked to the guard shack,</i>

07:25.903 --> 07:27.572
<i>he was arrested immediately.</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:33.244
<i>The police recovered Diane Wilder's coat</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:34.745
<i>hidden near the guard shack.</i>

07:35.663 --> 07:37.832
Who else was involved but Ken Bianchi?

07:37.915 --> 07:40.334
He was in full denial

07:40.418 --> 07:42.837
that he had anything to do with it.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.215
HOLES: <i>When detectives arrest Bianchi,</i>

07:46.299 --> 07:48.092
he's very cooperative.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.094
GEDDES: <i>When the police went to him</i>

07:50.178 --> 07:53.389
<i>requesting permission</i>
<i>to search his house and cars,</i>

07:53.931 --> 07:56.142
<i>he signed right away a permission slip.</i>

07:57.560 --> 07:59.812
He said he couldn't understand
why he'd been arrested.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.274
HOLES: <i>They ask, "Hey,</i>
<i>can we search your briefcase?"</i>

08:03.357 --> 08:04.942
And he gives them the combination.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.237
<i>It's almost as if he had</i>
<i>no care in the world</i>

08:08.321 --> 08:10.198
<i>about the fact that he was being looked at</i>

08:10.281 --> 08:12.283
<i>for two murders up there in Bellingham.</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:18.289
I was going through
the briefcase that he had

08:18.372 --> 08:19.707
at the time of arrest.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.755
<i>I found that Kenneth Bianchi</i>
<i>had moved from the LA area</i>

08:25.838 --> 08:27.757
<i>and moved up to Bellingham.</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:32.887
<i>So, I put a call in to the</i>
<i>Los Angeles Sheriff's Office</i>

08:32.970 --> 08:37.183
<i>to see if they had anything</i>
<i>on Kenneth Bianchi.</i>

08:38.267 --> 08:39.852
<i>Investigator came to this machine,</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:42.188
<i>entered Kenneth Bianchi's name</i>
<i>and his birth date...</i>

08:44.398 --> 08:46.943
<i>received this teletype from the</i>
<i>Department of Motor Vehicles.</i>

08:47.026 --> 08:50.571
<i>It says "Kenneth Alessio</i>
<i>Bianchi, 809 East Garfield, Apartment D."</i>

08:50.655 --> 08:53.324
<i>Kristina Weckler, one of the victims,</i>
<i>lived in Apartment C or E</i>

08:53.407 --> 08:55.910
<i>right next door at 809 East Garfield.</i>

08:55.993 --> 08:58.120
<i>Also, Cindy Hudspeth, our last victim,</i>

08:58.204 --> 09:00.581
<i>lived across the street</i>
<i>at 800 East Garfield.</i>

09:01.916 --> 09:05.378
GEDDES: <i>Five minutes later,</i>
<i>a detective called me back,</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:08.714
said, "We'll be on a plane
to Bellingham tomorrow."

09:10.049 --> 09:12.468
HOLES: <i>They see that he has</i>
<i>two addresses</i>

<i>that overlap with</i>
<i>the Hillside Strangler series.</i>

09:16.055 --> 09:19.433
Additionally, the details of what happened
to the two women

09:19.517 --> 09:21.852

09:21.936 --> 09:24.063
very similar to the details

09:24.146 --> 09:26.857
of what the Hillside Strangler
was doing in Los Angeles.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.734
From then on, we just started

just connecting the dots,
one after the other.

this is just-- this is just
too much a coincidence.

We are really getting a break finally.

McEACHRAN: <i>Once it became apparent</i>

NEWS REPORTER:
<i>The 27-year-old former security guard</i>

10:07.773 --> 10:09.817
<i>of two state university co-eds here.</i>

10:09.900 --> 10:12.486
I can remember every single station

10:12.570 --> 10:13.654
that had reporters up there.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.823
I mean, it was a big deal.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.826
<i>It was a story that this town</i>
<i>had really never seen before.</i>

10:18.909 --> 10:22.371
McEACHRAN:
<i>There was a very intense media circus</i>

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
<i>that seemed to envelop the case,</i>

10:24.373 --> 10:27.460
that every time I went to court,
I would have to have a press conference.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.962
<i>We're trying to proceed</i>
<i>as quickly as we can of course,</i>

10:30.046 --> 10:32.089
<i>and I--I really haven't set</i>
<i>a specific date in my mind</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:34.175
<i>but we are proceeding as fast as we can.</i>

10:34.258 --> 10:37.011
And we were just working
on trying to get our case down

10:37.094 --> 10:38.554
and get it tied down

10:38.638 --> 10:40.931
to get all of the evidence in line.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.268
And LA was further developing
the connections

10:44.352 --> 10:46.729
that, uh, that they
subsequently came up with.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.233
GEORGE HERRERA: <i>I was coming to work,</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:54.403
and, uh, I'm listening to news radio.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.074
And they're talking about a suspect

10:58.741 --> 11:02.203
that had come up in the Hillside Strangler
investigation.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.830
I can't tell you how many other suspects,

11:04.914 --> 11:06.540
named suspects, that came up

11:07.249 --> 11:10.628
who, uh, I remember, uh,
the task force saying,

11:10.711 --> 11:12.421
"This guy might be pretty good."

11:13.089 --> 11:15.966
And I'd compare the prints
and it would be negative.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.636
And so, I'm hearing this on the radio,

11:18.719 --> 11:20.805
and I'm kind of shaking my head

11:20.888 --> 11:23.307
and I said, probably, probably nothing.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.435
<i>I get to work.</i>

11:26.519 --> 11:29.855
<i>Dud Varney comes in, he was one</i>
<i>of the main investigators on the case.</i>

11:29.939 --> 11:32.358
<i>He comes in with a fingerprint card,</i>

11:32.441 --> 11:34.610
<i>and he lays it down on my desk.</i>

11:35.152 --> 11:37.613
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Is this the guy from Washington?"</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:39.657
And he says, "Yes."

11:45.037 --> 11:47.790
ROBERT GROGAN:
<i>Bianchi's fingerprints were compared</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:52.086
<i>to the fingerprints</i>
<i>found at the phone booth</i>

11:52.169 --> 11:55.881
at the public library
where the call to Martin was made.

11:56.549 --> 12:01.011
<i>I immediately noticed that</i>
<i>he had a pattern in one of his fingers</i>

12:01.095 --> 12:05.349
<i>that we had been looking at</i>
<i>for probably close to a year.</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:09.270
I had compared that print
to so many suspects manually

12:09.812 --> 12:12.106
that it was imprinted in my brain.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.985
<i>And I literally dreamed of that print.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:20.030
<i>Here is an enlargement</i>

12:20.114 --> 12:25.035
<i>of the, uh, left ring finger</i>
<i>of Kenneth Bianchi.</i>

12:25.619 --> 12:30.875
<i>The characteristics present</i>
<i>in this latent fingerprint matched.</i>

12:30.958 --> 12:32.793
I remember my heart pounding.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.213
I remember the adrenaline rush that I got.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.090
<i>I was jumping around here like,</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:39.967
<i>like a ping-pong ball.</i>

12:40.050 --> 12:42.219
<i>I was elated. It was unbelievable.</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:45.473
I stood up, screamed, "I--I got him,"

12:46.098 --> 12:47.349
and something else.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.811
And then I ran out of the office.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.356
<i>I caught up with Dud Varney</i>
<i>at the elevators.</i>

12:54.940 --> 12:57.777
And told him, "I got him,
I got him, I got him.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.236
It's him, it's him."

12:59.320 --> 13:03.866
He puts me in a bear hug
that I--I--I just, I'll just never forget.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.326
I thought I was gonna lose my breath.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.952
It was just pure ecstasy.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.747
I mean, I've never experienced
anything like that.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.960
GROGAN: <i>Someday you hope</i>
<i>you'll identify that son of a bitch,</i>

13:15.044 --> 13:16.629
and we did.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.172
Hundred percent match.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.009
GEDDES: <i>The lead detective said that</i>

13:22.092 --> 13:24.804
Kenneth Bianchi had actually come up

13:24.887 --> 13:26.806
as one of their names

13:26.889 --> 13:28.849
in the Hillside Strangler case.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.769
NEWS REPORTER: <i>Police questioned Bianchi</i>
<i>last February and released him.</i>

13:32.228 --> 13:34.855
<i>The episode became another closed clue,</i>

13:34.939 --> 13:38.317
<i>one of more than 10,000 the task force has</i>
<i>examined to date.</i>

13:38.400 --> 13:41.529
GEDDES: <i>All these pieces</i>
<i>were all coming together.</i>

13:41.612 --> 13:43.948
The fact that I made the call,

13:44.031 --> 13:47.117
that was the missing piece
that they needed.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.663
MURPHY: <i>Police already knew</i>
<i>that Bianchi had killed all these victims.</i>

13:51.247 --> 13:53.749
BOREN: <i>But they were also sure</i>
<i>there was a second man,</i>

13:53.833 --> 13:55.292
and they needed to find that man.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.711
We knew we were dealing with two guys.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.172
We knew it wasn't complete
and it wasn't over.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.216
<i>The investigation had a long way to go.</i>

14:12.226 --> 14:15.855
GROGAN: <i>We had started to spend</i>
<i>a tremendous amount of effort</i>

14:15.938 --> 14:18.440
and back checking and corroborating

14:18.524 --> 14:21.735
<i>any contact that people had with Bianchi.</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:24.321
Police believe that Angelo Buono,

14:24.405 --> 14:27.575
<i>who was Bianchi's cousin,</i>
<i>was the second killer.</i>

14:28.158 --> 14:30.452
These are two cousins,
that means they can go out and murder,

14:30.536 --> 14:33.581
<i>and they don't have to worry about anybody</i>
<i>telling on anybody.</i>

14:34.081 --> 14:37.459
<i>That made sense. That's why</i>
<i>they got away with it for so long.</i>

14:38.335 --> 14:43.215
<i>We had all the background</i>
<i>that we could do done on Angelo Buono.</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:47.845
<i>The only thing we know is</i>
<i>he owns an upholstery shop</i>

14:47.928 --> 14:50.514
<i>on Colorado Boulevard in Glendale.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:53.267
No criminal record.

14:55.644 --> 15:00.274
<i>We decided that we'd go to Angelo's</i>
<i>and try to establish some rapport,</i>

15:00.357 --> 15:02.276
get some feeling of the surroundings,

15:02.359 --> 15:04.320
what was there, et cetera, et cetera.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.614
We would just do a preliminary visit.

15:08.532 --> 15:13.787
<i>He was very cool and</i>
<i>comfortable in his own persona.</i>

15:15.039 --> 15:17.708
He looked like somebody
who was very street smart

15:18.667 --> 15:22.212
<i>and not concerned</i>
<i>about the police or anything.</i>

15:22.796 --> 15:25.174
<i>We found out he was</i>
<i>a pretty good street con</i>

15:25.257 --> 15:26.675
<i>and a good businessman.</i>

15:27.927 --> 15:31.013
At that time, I figured
that we would just back off

15:31.096 --> 15:34.433
and come back
when we got more information.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.520
MURPHY: <i>Police learned that the sites</i>
<i>where all these women had been dumped</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:42.441
<i>were very close to areas</i>
<i>that Buono knew very well.</i>

15:42.524 --> 15:46.862
A witness also come forward
who said she saw Bianchi and Buono

15:46.946 --> 15:48.822
attempting to pick up a girl.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.950
My question is what do you do with it?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.660
He's out there, he's still operating.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.536
He can walk around doing whatever he does.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.705
He has not been arrested,
he's not been interrogated.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
But he could leave.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.376
He could be in the wind.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.252
What do you do? You watch him.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.758
HOLES: <i>Investigators go</i>
<i>to LAPD's noted SIS team,</i>

16:07.841 --> 16:10.010
the Special Investigation Section,

16:10.094 --> 16:12.221
that's very adept at surveillance.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.764
When you gave them an assignment,

16:13.847 --> 16:17.267
you knew that you were getting
the best to do the job.

16:17.351 --> 16:21.438
<i>And the Frog was--</i>
<i>we call him the Frog, LeFrois.</i>

16:21.522 --> 16:23.649
<i>He was a great SIS guy.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:28.362
We were told to go out
and set up a surveillance

16:28.445 --> 16:30.990
on a guy named Angelo Buono.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.284
<i>We obtained a motorhome</i>

16:34.910 --> 16:38.497
<i>and we found a market</i>

16:39.289 --> 16:43.002
<i>that was east of Buono's shop</i>
<i>and residence.</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:47.047
We set up that as our base camp
to follow him wherever he went.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.466
Jesus, we can't have him go out
and killing anybody

16:49.550 --> 16:51.135
while we're still investigating
this thing.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.761
We'd look pretty stupid, wouldn't we?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.932
So we told Jerry
this has to be a surveillance

16:57.016 --> 16:59.977
that is somewhat obvious

17:00.060 --> 17:02.688
to make him aware that we're watching him.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.773
<i>Honk.</i>

17:04.940 --> 17:07.276
(horn honking)

17:07.443 --> 17:08.402
<i>Honk.</i>

17:08.902 --> 17:09.903
<i>Honk a couple times.</i>

17:10.029 --> 17:11.030
(honking continues)

17:12.072 --> 17:14.575
LEFROIS: <i>We wanted him to know</i>
<i>we were there, and he knew it.</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:18.037
He knew exactly where we were.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.999
<i>Buono would come out</i>
<i>every morning 8:00, 8:30,</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:25.461
<i>pick up his newspaper</i>
<i>from the driveway or the lawn,</i>

17:26.211 --> 17:29.048
and look over at us and flip us off.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.760
<i>And let it go, that's fine.</i>

17:33.927 --> 17:35.637
We'll see who laughs last.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.895
MURPHY: <i>So at the same time</i>
<i>the police are investigating</i>

17:42.978 --> 17:45.689
<i>the Hillside Strangler murders,</i>
<i>there's a different case.</i>

17:46.273 --> 17:48.358
Serial killers don't announce themselves.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.860
They operate in the shadows,

17:49.943 --> 17:52.905
often times committing murder
after murder for years,

17:52.988 --> 17:57.242
<i>with the police never realizing</i>
<i>that the victims are connected.</i>

18:01.455 --> 18:03.499
STEVE MACK: <i>Huntington Beach</i>
<i>has always enjoyed a reputation</i>

18:03.582 --> 18:05.084
<i>as being a safe community.</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
How could this happen
while we were out here?

18:08.128 --> 18:09.588
We're supposed to protect the girls.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.842
<i>In 1979, Huntington Beach was</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:16.095
<i>a large surf community.</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:19.973
<i>Kids of all ages would spend</i>
<i>their days at the beach</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:21.308
<i>in the summertime</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:24.103
<i>without any worries</i>
<i>of something happening.</i>

18:25.354 --> 18:28.065
On June 20th of 1979,

18:28.148 --> 18:32.111
law enforcement gets a call
from Robin Samsoe's mother

18:32.194 --> 18:35.656
<i>about her 12-year-old daughter</i>
<i>who had gone missing.</i>

18:35.739 --> 18:38.158
She had reportedly been
at the beach all day with her friend

18:38.242 --> 18:40.744
and was due at a dance class
at four o'clock.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.206
Once dance class was over,
the dance instructor called her mother

18:44.289 --> 18:46.333
and said that Robin never showed up.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.503
<i>A police officer went out</i>
<i>and took a report.</i>

18:50.087 --> 18:51.922
They figured that it's something more

18:52.005 --> 18:55.592
than her not coming home on time
because she missed her dance class

18:55.676 --> 18:57.970
<i>which she was very loyal to going.</i>

18:59.138 --> 19:01.807
So, police talked to Bridget,
Robin's good friend

19:01.890 --> 19:03.308
who was with her that afternoon.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.145
<i>She says they go to the beach.</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:10.899
<i>This guy comes up and asks</i>
<i>if he could take their picture.</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:15.654
<i>He said there's a contest,</i>
<i>he'll put them in a magazine.</i>

19:16.697 --> 19:19.950
An adult that was down
on the beach noticed

19:20.033 --> 19:22.077
this man approaching
these two young girls,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.955
<i>knew it was inappropriate, and came over.</i>

19:25.038 --> 19:28.876
<i>And as she approached,</i>
<i>the man turned his back</i>

19:28.959 --> 19:30.294
<i>and scurried away.</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:32.963
They go back to Bridget's house,

19:33.046 --> 19:36.300
and Robin's running late for dance school.

19:36.383 --> 19:40.012
<i>So, Bridget says,</i>
<i>"Take my bike but don't stop,"</i>

19:40.095 --> 19:43.265
because Bridget was aware enough
about this guy,

19:43.348 --> 19:45.100
she got such a bad feeling

19:45.184 --> 19:48.937
that she told Robin to just keep going.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.148
<i>So, she took the bike</i>

19:51.857 --> 19:55.485
<i>and never showed up at the school.</i>

19:56.820 --> 19:58.822
MURPHY: <i>When you talk about</i>
<i>a missing 12-year-old,</i>

19:58.906 --> 20:02.117
<i>you're talking about</i>
<i>an extremely urgent situation.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:05.454
You have this very limited
window where you're either gonna find her

20:05.537 --> 20:07.789
or she's potentially gonna be
in mortal danger.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.960
MACK: <i>A statewide teletype</i>

20:12.044 --> 20:15.047
<i>was put out of a possible child abduction.</i>

20:15.130 --> 20:16.965
Myself and other patrol officers

20:17.049 --> 20:20.636
kept driving through back alleys
and shopping centers

20:20.719 --> 20:22.846
<i>looking for that bicycle</i>
<i>that could have been discarded.</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:25.557
<i>We'd get out and check</i>
<i>dumpsters behind stores.</i>

20:26.141 --> 20:28.143
I think most of the patrol officers
took it personal

20:28.227 --> 20:30.229
that a 12-year-old girl could be taken

20:30.312 --> 20:31.939
<i>from the City of Huntington Beach.</i>

20:32.022 --> 20:33.941
<i>Kids are supposed to be able</i>
<i>to go out and play</i>

20:34.024 --> 20:35.234
<i>with relative safety.</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:38.570
<i>And it's kind of an affront</i>
<i>to our position</i>

20:38.654 --> 20:40.781
so it bothered me in particular,

20:40.864 --> 20:43.659
and it also changed
the way my children grew up.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.786
They weren't allowed to go
to the beach by themselves.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.209
Bridget went down to the police station
and worked with the sketch artist.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.213
MACK: <i>It takes several hours</i>
<i>to do a composite.</i>

20:56.296 --> 20:58.882
<i>You have to talk to the witness</i>
<i>and get to know the witness</i>

20:58.966 --> 21:01.009
and put them at ease in dealing with you.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.469
They're sometimes going to tell you,

21:02.552 --> 21:06.765
I don't remember anything
about what this guy looked like,

21:06.848 --> 21:08.767
it happened so fast.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.852
<i>And then the sketch artist</i>
<i>will start talking,</i>

21:10.936 --> 21:12.187
<i>so what did his face look like?</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:15.315
<i>Was it long? Was it round?</i>

21:16.066 --> 21:18.610
The sketch artist would draw a little bit,

21:18.694 --> 21:21.405
and Bridget would say, yeah, that's right.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.740
And then no, no, no, that's not it.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.951
<i>Make the hair curlier.</i>

21:26.952 --> 21:28.704
MACK: <i>Same thing happens</i>
<i>with their nose</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:31.498
<i>and their lips and their ears.</i>

21:31.581 --> 21:34.334
PATTIN: <i>To the point where she looked</i>
<i>at that picture and said,</i>

21:34.418 --> 21:36.628
"That is him."

21:38.505 --> 21:41.133
The police released that sketch
into the community,

21:41.216 --> 21:44.928
the community that's in uproar
over this missing girl

21:45.012 --> 21:46.346
<i>that they can't solve.</i>

21:50.058 --> 21:53.270
PATTIN: <i>So, now the sketch is out</i>
<i>in the media,</i>

21:53.353 --> 21:55.188
<i>it's everywhere.</i>

21:55.772 --> 22:00.819
This was a big story, especially across
Southern California.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.698
<i>So, of course,</i>
<i>the police got lots of calls.</i>

22:04.781 --> 22:07.200
But there was one call in particular.

22:08.076 --> 22:11.121
<i>It was from this guy in West Hollywood</i>

22:11.204 --> 22:16.001
who had seen a young girl
getting abducted 10 years ago.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.546
<i>And he recognized the sketch,</i>

22:19.629 --> 22:23.050
<i>and it's a guy named Rodney Alcala.</i>

22:27.346 --> 22:32.267
♪♪

22:32.934 --> 22:35.729
MURPHY: <i>In 1968, Tali Shapiro</i>
<i>was eight years old,</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:39.941
<i>and she is the original</i>
<i>"don't take rides from strangers" victim.</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:43.236
She's a gregarious happy little 8-year-old

22:43.320 --> 22:44.488
walking to school.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.407
<i>And a car pulled up next to her</i>

22:47.491 --> 22:49.493
<i>and the man said, "Would you like a ride?"</i>

22:49.576 --> 22:51.870
And she said, "I'm not supposed
to take rides from strangers."

22:51.953 --> 22:54.498
And he said, "No problem,
I'm not a stranger.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.832
I know your parents."

And she got in the car and off they went.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.757
A good Samaritan sees that,
and it didn't look right to him,

23:03.840 --> 23:07.094
<i>so he decided to follow the car.</i>

23:07.761 --> 23:10.722
And it goes to an apartment complex.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.308
<i>He watches this man</i>
<i>take this little girl out</i>

23:13.392 --> 23:15.143
<i>and lead her into this house.</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:17.854
This good Samaritan went to a pay phone

23:17.938 --> 23:19.106
and called the police.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.402
<i>And the first person who showed up</i>
<i>was officer Camacho.</i>

23:25.195 --> 23:27.948
CHRIS CAMACHO: <i>October the 25th, 1968,</i>

23:28.031 --> 23:29.783
I received a call.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.993
(indistinct police radio chatter)

23:32.077 --> 23:34.413
<i>To see a man about a possible kidnapping.</i>

23:35.163 --> 23:37.374
<i>When you get a call like that,</i>

23:37.457 --> 23:39.084
<i>there's a lot of things</i>
<i>going through your mind</i>

23:39.167 --> 23:42.129
because you don't know if it's
a father picking up his child,

23:42.212 --> 23:44.005
maybe it's a divorced couple.

23:44.089 --> 23:48.176
Broad daylight kidnappings
were rare at that time.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.640
<i>As I looked at the house</i>

23:53.723 --> 23:56.059
<i>and I looked at the car parked</i>
<i>adjacent to the house,</i>

23:56.143 --> 23:59.020
<i>there were no license plates</i>
<i>on it front or rear.</i>

23:59.980 --> 24:03.775
Removing the license plates
is certainly premeditated,

24:03.859 --> 24:07.571
<i>so that immediately picked up my interest.</i>

24:07.654 --> 24:09.781
He was prepared for this.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.161
<i>So I went to the front door.</i>

24:18.165 --> 24:20.208
I started knocking and says,

24:20.292 --> 24:22.752
police, uh, I need to speak with you.

24:23.628 --> 24:27.090
<i>A male with no clothes on</i>
<i>pulled the blinds aside</i>

24:27.174 --> 24:29.634
<i>and said, "I just got out of the shower."</i>

24:30.177 --> 24:32.637
<i>He didn't have a towel on, he wasn't wet,</i>

24:33.597 --> 24:37.934
and I was six inches
from him face-to-face.

24:38.268 --> 24:43.356
There was a--a... rage in his eyes

24:44.774 --> 24:46.902
that I--I have seen it before.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.403
I needed to get in there.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.615
<i>So, I'm banging more forcibly.</i>

24:52.282 --> 24:55.076
<i>I heard what I thought</i>
<i>was a moan or moans.</i>

24:56.161 --> 24:58.997
And that's-- at that,
within a second or two

24:59.080 --> 25:00.332
is when I kicked the door in.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.710
The first thing I saw

25:03.877 --> 25:06.129
right in front of me was the kitchen area.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.342
<i>To one side was a pair of white shoes,</i>

25:10.967 --> 25:12.344
<i>a white dress,</i>

25:12.427 --> 25:16.223
<i>and I saw this poor little girl just--</i>

25:17.390 --> 25:19.100
I--I just couldn't believe

25:19.184 --> 25:21.478
there was that much blood
from a little girl.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.524
<i>She had a steel bar across her neck.</i>

25:26.441 --> 25:29.444
And her face was--was blue.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.031
She--she had no movement at all.
There was no breathing.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.449
I thought she was dead.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.536
<i>We're trained in the police academy--</i>

25:37.619 --> 25:39.746
<i>protect the scene</i>
<i>and don't touch anything.</i>

25:40.747 --> 25:44.626
For some reason,
I, against all my training,

25:44.709 --> 25:48.171
against everything I was taught,
I took the bar off her neck.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.298
<i>and that weighed about ten pounds.</i>

25:50.882 --> 25:52.342
I just couldn't leave it there.

25:52.801 --> 25:56.263
And the little girl started gagging.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.265
She was gasping for air.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.561
<i>Immediately then, that</i>
<i>changed the whole scenario.</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:06.147
MURPHY: <i>The suspect escaped</i>
<i>out of the back of the apartment.</i>

26:06.231 --> 26:07.983
<i>Officer Camacho's facing this choice:</i>

26:08.149 --> 26:10.610
do I catch a bad guy
or save the little girl?

26:11.403 --> 26:14.322
CAMACHO: <i>We wanted to make sure</i>
<i>that this little girl was gonna live.</i>

26:15.156 --> 26:16.324
And that's--that's what we did.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.784
That's the decision we made,

26:17.867 --> 26:19.578
that I made.

26:19.911 --> 26:24.124
<i>And we had to call the ambulance,</i>
<i>we're trying to save this little girl.</i>

26:24.499 --> 26:27.961
Later on, I found out
her name was Tali Shapiro.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.424
MURPHY: <i>They're able to put</i>
<i>this crime scene together,</i>

26:32.507 --> 26:36.177
<i>and they found hundreds</i>
<i>and hundreds of photographs</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:38.513
of young girls and young boys

26:38.597 --> 26:40.348
in positions of vulnerability.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.267
All of these individuals

26:42.350 --> 26:44.978
that have never been identified
to this day.

26:45.604 --> 26:50.400
We also found a student ID from UCLA

26:51.026 --> 26:54.446
stating that he was a,
uh, undergrad student

26:54.529 --> 26:56.239
in the photography department.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.243
<i>And it had the name of Rodney Alcala.</i>

27:03.872 --> 27:06.166
MURPHY: <i>At this point,</i>
<i>Rodney Alcala is on the run,</i>

27:06.249 --> 27:08.460
and the window to catch him
is closing fast.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.128
We found bank statements.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.297
We sent a patrol car to the bank,

27:12.380 --> 27:13.632
and we were five minutes late.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.217
Alcala disappeared.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.764
CAMACHO: <i>I went to the hospital</i>
<i>to check on Tali Shapiro.</i>

27:23.058 --> 27:25.602
She was in a coma approximately a month.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.271
And of course, you know,
with someone that's unconscious

27:28.355 --> 27:30.482
the longer it goes,
the more uncertainty you have

27:30.565 --> 27:32.150
<i>if they'll never come out of it.</i>

27:40.367 --> 27:44.162
♪♪

27:44.245 --> 27:46.998
TALI SHAPIRO: <i>Back then,</i>
<i>it was fairly safe to walk to school.</i>

27:50.377 --> 27:51.920
<i>Like, that day, I remember it was warm,</i>

27:52.003 --> 27:53.838
<i>it was sunny, I was in a sun dress.</i>

27:55.674 --> 27:58.259
He approached me,
he asked if I wanted a ride.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.303
I told him I didn't talk to strangers.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.472
Then he told me he knew my parents,

28:02.555 --> 28:05.266
<i>so I reluctantly got in the car.</i>

28:11.773 --> 28:14.609
I remember feeling uncomfortable
once I got in the car

28:15.151 --> 28:18.738
because he said he wanted
to stop by his place

28:18.822 --> 28:20.281
and show me a poster.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.952
There was a gentleman
in a car across the street,

28:25.286 --> 28:27.914
my guardian angel, um, this good Samaritan

28:28.498 --> 28:31.209
who saw me hesitate to get into the car

28:31.292 --> 28:34.129
and chose to follow us.

28:34.587 --> 28:38.633
I don't remember much
of anything from that day

28:39.217 --> 28:41.720
partly because I had a head injury,

28:41.803 --> 28:45.765
um, and my body probably just chooses

28:45.849 --> 28:47.350
not to remember, you know.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.438
Both the gentleman in the--
in the-- in the car

28:51.521 --> 28:53.648
and Camacho are my heroes.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.151
The doctor said that, uh,

28:56.651 --> 28:59.279
had I not removed that bar from her neck,

28:59.362 --> 29:01.781
she probably would not have
cleared her airway.

29:04.451 --> 29:08.371
I've lived with this case
for, pff, almost 20 years,

29:08.455 --> 29:11.791
and I can tell you
there is, there is no way

29:11.875 --> 29:13.710
in my opinion he should have done
anything differently.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.421
He made the right call.
He saved the little girl.

29:16.504 --> 29:19.174
But as a result, Rodney Alcala got away.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.302
You have to make those decisions,
and you have to live by them.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.179
To save her life

29:25.180 --> 29:29.684
and give five minutes head start
to the suspect,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.227
I would do it again.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.026
MURPHY:
<i>With Rodney Alcala still on the loose,</i>

29:38.109 --> 29:40.570
the LAPD reached out to people
that might have known him,

29:40.653 --> 29:42.864
including his professors at UCLA.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.618
<i>This case was assigned</i>
<i>to an LAPD detective named Steve Hodel.</i>

29:47.535 --> 29:49.287
STEVE HODEL: <i>I went to UCLA.</i>

29:49.370 --> 29:51.456
I remember talking
to one of his professors,

29:51.998 --> 29:54.042
and I said, we're looking for this man.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.379
<i>He committed a rape and</i>
<i>attempted murder on a child.</i>

29:58.463 --> 30:01.424
And the professor says, no.
He says, no way.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.426
<i>He says, you got the wrong man.</i>

30:03.510 --> 30:05.970
<i>Brilliant mind, wonderful student,</i>

30:06.805 --> 30:08.556
gentle, just the nicest person.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.516
There is just no way.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.935
Alcala would never do anything like that.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.687
MURPHY: <i>Once the leads dried up,</i>

30:14.771 --> 30:17.065
<i>Steve Hodel actually did a very good job</i>

30:17.148 --> 30:19.025
of convincing the FBI
to place Rodney Alcala

30:19.359 --> 30:21.027
<i>on their ten most wanted list.</i>

30:21.110 --> 30:23.321
<i>Essentially being on the</i>
<i>ten most wanted list means</i>

30:23.404 --> 30:26.741
<i>that your picture is going to be posted</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:28.868
at every post office in America.

30:29.702 --> 30:33.456
<i>FBI's ten most wanted list is</i>
<i>almost exclusively reserved for murderers</i>

30:33.540 --> 30:35.792
or, like, big mafia figures
or things like that.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.294
And this was the kidnapping and rape

30:38.378 --> 30:40.004
of an 8-year-old who lived.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.636
<i>It took politics,</i>
<i>and it took a lot of hard work,</i>

30:46.803 --> 30:50.181
<i>for Detective Hodel to convince</i>
<i>the FBI to add Rodney Alcala.</i>

30:52.433 --> 30:56.437
Two girls that were staying
at an upstate New York summer camp

30:56.521 --> 30:58.523
went to a local post office
to mail some letters

30:58.606 --> 31:01.901
<i>and on the wall they saw</i>
<i>the FBI's ten most wanted list,</i>

31:01.985 --> 31:06.447
<i>and there is one of the people</i>
<i>who works in their camp.</i>

31:07.740 --> 31:09.868
<i>He adopted the name John Berger.</i>

31:10.910 --> 31:13.538
And of all things, he's working
at a summer camp in upstate New York

31:13.621 --> 31:14.706
with kids.

31:14.789 --> 31:15.957
(ringing)

31:16.040 --> 31:18.251
HODEL: <i>Suddenly, I got a call.</i>

31:18.334 --> 31:21.588
They've got Rodney Alcala.
He's in custody.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.009
<i>We go to pick him up back east.</i>

31:26.593 --> 31:29.470
<i>He was pleasant, he was relaxed.</i>

31:29.554 --> 31:31.264
<i>He was cooperative with us.</i>

31:31.347 --> 31:35.059
By all appearances, you're not getting
anything evil here.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.146
<i>I could see this is a guy</i>

31:38.229 --> 31:41.024
<i>that could be very disarming to women.</i>

31:41.524 --> 31:43.526
<i>They could find him very attractive.</i>

31:44.736 --> 31:48.740
Part of my mind is seeing
this guy raping and beating

31:48.823 --> 31:49.949
an 8-year-old,

31:50.491 --> 31:52.076
and the other part is seeing

31:52.160 --> 31:56.915
<i>this soft, pleasant,</i>
<i>polite young man my age.</i>

31:56.998 --> 31:59.626
Clearly, he was a perfect chameleon.

32:00.793 --> 32:04.005
Just in that short time
and the flight back,

32:04.088 --> 32:06.424
<i>I was hoping he would open up and talk.</i>

32:06.507 --> 32:09.469
<i>I've always had an ability</i>
<i>to get people to talk to me.</i>

32:10.303 --> 32:12.472
He says, Alcala, he, he doesn't
want to talk about it.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.934
<i>It was like a dual personality</i>
<i>type of thing</i>

32:16.017 --> 32:17.727
<i>or as he wants us to think.</i>

32:17.810 --> 32:19.896
<i>Bring him back, he's booked into custody</i>

32:19.979 --> 32:21.773
<i>and the trial date is set.</i>

32:22.982 --> 32:24.651
MURPHY: <i>Initially, this seems</i>
<i>like it would be a,</i>

32:24.734 --> 32:26.569
<i>basically an open-and-shut case.</i>

32:26.653 --> 32:29.572
The prosecution was relying
on the availability

32:29.656 --> 32:31.699
of Tali Shapiro to be able
to tell the story.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.830
CAMACHO: <i>Tali's father decided that</i>

32:37.914 --> 32:42.085
for the best interest of the family
they moved to Chapala, Mexico.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.587
<i>So, she was not there to testify.</i>

32:45.463 --> 32:48.299
My parents did not talk about it

32:49.092 --> 32:50.426
ever, ever, ever.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.262
They got rid of any photographs
or anything.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.639
It wasn't spoken about.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.767
I guess I'm grateful
that my parents didn't have me

32:57.850 --> 32:59.727
in and out of court.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.104
I didn't know any details.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.064
I knew I'd been kidnapped.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.985
I wasn't aware that I'd been raped
until much, much later.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.988
MURPHY: <i>He wound up pleading guilty</i>

33:10.071 --> 33:11.698
<i>to child molestation.</i>

33:12.323 --> 33:15.118
That was still a life sentence
back in 1968.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.245
With that, the California parole board

33:17.328 --> 33:19.622
could have kept him in custody forever.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.501
PATTIN: <i>Rodney Alcala did only 34 months.</i>

33:23.584 --> 33:24.669
<i>Why?</i>

33:24.752 --> 33:27.588
Because he could charm people.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.592
MURPHY: <i>He's going to work</i>
<i>that system immediately.</i>

33:31.676 --> 33:34.595
He's hyper-intelligent, he's charming,

33:34.679 --> 33:35.972
and he's gonna play the game.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.933
So he was able to go in
and go, "Yep, I got help"

33:39.017 --> 33:40.101
whatever that is--

33:40.184 --> 33:44.105
"for my desire to rape
and kill little girls

33:44.188 --> 33:46.524
<i>so I'm good to be released."</i>

33:46.607 --> 33:47.692
<i>And they bought it.</i>

33:50.069 --> 33:51.946
CAMACHO: <i>When I found out</i>
<i>that he had gotten released</i>

33:52.030 --> 33:53.114
<i>after two-and-a-half years,</i>

33:53.197 --> 33:55.366
I was just flabbergasted.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.951
I--I couldn't believe it.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.327
Would he have stayed in jail

33:58.411 --> 34:01.289
if I had testified
when I was 9, 10, 11, 12?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.167
It's hard to say, you know.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.754
It's a shame that he wasn't kept in jail
for what he did to me,

34:07.837 --> 34:10.173
'cause then none of these other people
would have gotten killed.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.051
It's just a shame.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.890
Almost a decade after
the kidnapping and rape of Tali Shapiro,

34:18.973 --> 34:21.601
<i>Rodney Alcala would embark</i>

34:21.684 --> 34:24.479

the Hillside Strangler murders was made

40:03.150 --> 40:05.528
<i>He says Steve was, was quite put out.</i>

40:05.611 --> 40:07.655
FOX: <i>There seemed to be a real amnesia,</i>

40:07.738 --> 40:09.865
<i>a real loss of memory</i>
<i>as to what had transpired</i>

40:09.949 --> 40:12.076
<i>during the hour</i>
<i>when I was talking with Steve.</i>

40:12.159 --> 40:15.996
<i>I diagnosed it as a dissociative reaction</i>
<i>multiple personality type.</i>

40:18.124 --> 40:20.084
McEACHRAN: <i>I think</i>
<i>Dr. Watkins is such an advocate</i>

40:20.167 --> 40:21.502
<i>of multiple personalities</i>

40:21.585 --> 40:24.797

this being presented

40:24.880 --> 40:26.549

So, I think he was just
aiding him as he went along.

as the interviews went on.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.016

<i>killing a broad doesn't make</i>
<i>any difference to me.</i>

DR. WATKINS: <i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>maybe you didn't kill any of those,</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:53.242
<i>I don't know.</i>

40:53.325 --> 40:55.744
<i>Well, hey, no wrong, man. Hey,</i>
<i>I killed a couple of these.</i>

40:55.828 --> 40:56.912
<i>Well, which ones?</i>

40:56.996 --> 40:58.289
<i>This one I killed.</i>

40:59.248 --> 41:01.417
<i>These two, I don't know about.</i>

41:02.710 --> 41:05.796
FOX: <i>There was a question</i>
<i>about whether he was hypnotized or not.</i>

41:05.880 --> 41:08.549
There is an argument
that he was indeed hypnotized.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.926
<i>Hey, Dean, how you doing?</i>

41:11.802 --> 41:13.804
But it is possible

41:13.888 --> 41:16.974
that there was some picking up

41:17.057 --> 41:20.436
