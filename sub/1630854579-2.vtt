00:07.179 --> 00:09.285
- [News Anchor] Alexander
Litvinenko has died.

00:09.285 --> 00:11.183
But who or what killed him?

00:11.183 --> 00:13.703
Our security correspondent
is Gordon Carrera.

00:13.703 --> 00:15.463
- [Gordon]
Unfortunately, his death

00:15.463 --> 00:17.638
doesn't necessarily
bring us any closer

00:17.638 --> 00:19.329
to know what killed him.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.159
University College
Hospital said last night

00:21.159 --> 00:22.539
that he died at about 9:21

00:22.539 --> 00:24.783
and the medical team
did everything possible.

00:24.783 --> 00:27.027
They said, it's now in the
hands of Scotland Yard.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.131
- I'll do the talking.

00:33.999 --> 00:38.107
[people speaking indistinctly]

00:38.107 --> 00:39.936
And in fact, we
have confirmation

00:39.936 --> 00:41.731
that it was Polonium
that killed your husband,

00:41.731 --> 00:44.320
Mrs. Litvinenko,
that is a good thing.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.908
It means we can officially
investigate this

00:46.908 --> 00:48.979
as a suspicious death.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.707
- No.

00:52.707 --> 00:53.984
- [Clive] Sorry?

00:53.984 --> 00:55.745
- Not suspicious death,

00:56.953 --> 00:57.747
murder.

00:58.989 --> 01:00.819
Sasha was murdered.

01:00.819 --> 01:03.201
- [Clive] That may well
turn out to be the case.

01:03.201 --> 01:04.133
But for now.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.410
- He tell you what happened.

01:06.756 --> 01:07.688
He tell.

01:07.688 --> 01:10.518
[speaks in foreign language]

01:10.518 --> 01:12.348
- He told us lots of things,

01:12.348 --> 01:14.419
all of them extremely valuable.

01:14.419 --> 01:19.044
And his interviews
are our guide now.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.910
But we must be as thorough

01:23.842 --> 01:26.845
in interrogating his account

01:26.845 --> 01:28.329
as he was in giving it.

01:29.779 --> 01:33.472
It may also be that we have
to ask you to leave your home

01:33.472 --> 01:37.131
just for a time so we
can test for Polonium.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.512
- They've been here
for a month already.

01:38.512 --> 01:40.376
- I'm sure you understand.

01:40.376 --> 01:41.825
- [Duncan] There are places

01:41.825 --> 01:42.895
that we can make available
to you for these.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.656
- No, no, no, thank you.

01:44.656 --> 01:46.071
It can all be taken care of.

01:48.073 --> 01:53.043
- Now you'll have two family
liaison officers appointed.

01:54.390 --> 01:57.876
Ray with the beard
there, he's a vegetarian.

01:57.876 --> 02:01.397
And Aiden, he's an ex para,
who's frightened of spiders.

02:01.397 --> 02:02.915
Not that you heard it from me.

02:06.712 --> 02:07.541
- That's it?

02:10.889 --> 02:14.548
You go just like this?

02:14.548 --> 02:17.067
- I'm not gonna hang around to
offer you emotional support.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.310
That's their job.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.554
Mine is to find out who
did this to your husband

02:22.003 --> 02:23.488
and make sure justice is done.

02:29.873 --> 02:30.702
- Detective.

02:31.634 --> 02:33.877
[gentle music]

02:33.877 --> 02:34.844
Thank you.

02:34.844 --> 02:36.466
[gentle music]

02:36.466 --> 02:39.987
- Please, Mrs.
Litvinenko, not yet.

02:39.987 --> 02:42.748
[dramatic music]

02:49.169 --> 02:51.723
[car engines revving]

02:51.723 --> 02:54.381
- [Pat] I mean, one microgram
of this stuff is fatal.

02:54.381 --> 02:55.347
- Microgram?

02:55.347 --> 02:56.935
- About half a grain of sand.

02:56.935 --> 03:00.559
So in answer to your
next question, thousands,

03:00.559 --> 03:02.527
thousands, possibly
tens of thousands

03:02.527 --> 03:04.701
of lives are in danger here.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.600
I mean it's no
exaggeration to say

03:06.600 --> 03:09.292
that this is a chemical
attack on the United Kingdom.

03:10.811 --> 03:12.053
- Home Secretary.

03:12.053 --> 03:13.572
I know there are people
in this room are keen

03:13.572 --> 03:15.850
to get going on
a murder inquiry.

03:15.850 --> 03:17.197
It's our recommendation

03:17.197 --> 03:19.026
that this is a public
health issue first,

03:19.026 --> 03:20.648
a police matter, second.

03:20.648 --> 03:21.994
- We're sealing off any areas

03:21.994 --> 03:24.204
thought to be contaminated
with Polonium.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.792
That's already happened at
the hospital and the hotel.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.553
- And the sushi place.

03:28.553 --> 03:30.658
- [Pat] Then if we know
what are the sites to check,

03:30.658 --> 03:32.315
we can get a good idea of
how containable this is.

03:32.315 --> 03:35.007
- So it's not a public
health issue first, is it?

03:36.423 --> 03:37.803
- That's the recommendation.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.737
- Sure, but it won't
work like that.

03:40.737 --> 03:42.912
- We know how to
handle Polonium-210.

03:42.912 --> 03:46.122
- I agree, but you don't
know where to find it.

03:46.122 --> 03:47.641
Only last night we have
been told on the phone,

03:47.641 --> 03:49.919
this is the most dangerous
substance known to man,

03:49.919 --> 03:52.784
in this same breath is being
told it's impossible spot.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.303
Doesn't smell, doesn't
have any color,

03:54.303 --> 03:57.375
doesn't say good morning when
you come down for breakfast.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.928
[laughing]

03:58.928 --> 04:01.171
In order to get an handle on
the risk to public health,

04:01.171 --> 04:02.932
you have to know where it is.

04:02.932 --> 04:06.453
And you can't do that
without knowing who's had it

04:06.453 --> 04:07.764
and where they've been.

04:08.662 --> 04:11.320
Look, send us your teams.

04:12.769 --> 04:15.255
We'll identify the
sites that need checking

04:15.255 --> 04:16.635
so you can check them.

04:17.809 --> 04:20.743
And together we can
move forward on this.

04:20.743 --> 04:22.158
How's that sound?

04:22.158 --> 04:23.953
- [John] You don't
have a name card?

04:24.850 --> 04:26.266
- This is Clive Timmons,

04:26.266 --> 04:28.578
SIO on the Litvinenko
investigation.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.413
- And have you ever dealt with
a case like this, Detective?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.138
- Has anyone?

04:40.280 --> 04:44.284
[people speaking indistinctly]

04:45.871 --> 04:48.011
- [News Anchor] Because of
the fingers being pointed,

04:48.011 --> 04:51.843
not least by the victim
himself, at President Putin,

04:51.843 --> 04:54.535
is this likely to cause
a major diplomatic row?

04:54.535 --> 04:56.503
- [Simon] I think the
question is evidence.

04:56.503 --> 04:58.988
The efficiency, the
professionalism of this killing

04:58.988 --> 05:00.990
means precisely that
it may be very hard

05:00.990 --> 05:02.232
to find any evidence.

05:02.232 --> 05:03.303
- [News Anchor]
Simon, thank you.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.131
- Bloody hell.

05:05.063 --> 05:07.859
[dramatic music]

05:07.859 --> 05:11.000
- [Aiden] Thank you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.519
- Thanks.

05:12.519 --> 05:16.212
- So you go to school
around here, Anatoly?

05:18.835 --> 05:22.356
- Anatoly's school
is City of London.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.466
[car engine revving]

05:30.985 --> 05:32.332
- Time to pack some things.

05:44.482 --> 05:48.417
[people speaking indistinctly]

05:59.359 --> 06:02.189
[birds chirping]

06:02.189 --> 06:06.124
[people speaking indistinctly]

06:15.305 --> 06:17.860
[gentle music]

06:27.490 --> 06:30.182
[Marina crying]

06:36.223 --> 06:38.294
- [Nurse] They're asking
we clear the area.

06:39.502 --> 06:42.712
Detective, we need to go.

06:42.712 --> 06:43.989
- Sorry.

06:43.989 --> 06:45.128
[dramatic music]

06:45.128 --> 06:46.785
[heart machine beeping]

06:46.785 --> 06:49.616
[dramatic music]

06:54.966 --> 06:57.175
- Somebody within
the United Kingdom

06:57.175 --> 07:00.489
has been deliberately poisoned
by a type of radiation.

07:01.386 --> 07:04.147
It's known as an alpha emitter.

07:04.147 --> 07:07.634
So if the water in this
glass were Polonium,

07:07.634 --> 07:09.394
no radiation would escape.

07:10.257 --> 07:13.260
No harm would come to me or you

07:13.260 --> 07:15.676
by being here in its presence.

07:15.676 --> 07:19.335
However, were we to
ingest a single particle,

07:19.335 --> 07:22.372
if we ate it, drank
it, inhaled it

07:22.372 --> 07:24.305
as it floated through the air

07:24.305 --> 07:27.619
or returned our body
through a cut or a wound,

07:27.619 --> 07:29.138
that would be fatal.

07:29.138 --> 07:31.347
- [Reporter] Would you say the
general public are at risk?

07:31.347 --> 07:33.901
- [Pat] That I'm
afraid we cannot say.

07:33.901 --> 07:36.732
[dramatic music]

07:44.843 --> 07:46.983
- So at any given site,

07:46.983 --> 07:49.434
a clean, dirty line.

07:51.056 --> 07:52.920
On one side you are clean

07:52.920 --> 07:56.199
and on the other side you are
in a contaminated environment.

07:56.199 --> 07:57.787
So it's up to the line.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.930
Outer garments off,
hazmat suits on.

08:10.835 --> 08:13.596
And then it is boots and gloves.

08:17.427 --> 08:18.808
Then tape at the ankle,

08:20.154 --> 08:21.224
under the wrist.

08:24.780 --> 08:29.578
Then it is mask and hood

08:29.578 --> 08:33.029
and zips, fully
zipped and zips taped.

08:35.445 --> 08:37.447
Then a colleague
double checks for you.

08:37.447 --> 08:38.966
And thank you, Michael.

08:38.966 --> 08:40.450
Only now do we cross the line,

08:40.450 --> 08:43.661
making sure we've
got one of these.

08:43.661 --> 08:45.732
This is an alpha detector.

08:46.629 --> 08:48.458
[dramatic music]

08:48.458 --> 08:51.151
So we enter the site as a team.

08:52.462 --> 08:56.812
We move as a team,
sweeping as a team.

08:56.812 --> 08:59.815
In the event of a positive
reading, however minimal,

08:59.815 --> 09:02.058
you notify the team
leader and you exit

09:02.058 --> 09:04.405
in the exact same way.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.477
Deviate from any part of that

09:07.477 --> 09:09.583
and you put your life

09:09.583 --> 09:12.586
and the lives of the people
standing next to you right now

09:13.483 --> 09:14.864
in danger.

09:14.864 --> 09:16.486
[dramatic music]

09:16.486 --> 09:18.661
- We'll repeat
that one more time.

09:18.661 --> 09:20.076
And then we'll get
the list of sites

09:20.076 --> 09:21.768
from Detective Timmons here.

09:24.011 --> 09:25.288
Thank you Michael.

09:25.288 --> 09:28.360
- [Scientist] So, hazmat
suit then it's boots.

09:30.121 --> 09:34.125
[people speaking indistinctly]

09:35.402 --> 09:38.094
- [Clive] If I ask my
lot to go out there,

09:38.094 --> 09:39.682
they're gonna ask
me what the risk is

09:39.682 --> 09:42.029
and I'm gonna tell
'em about that.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.031
- You certainly
don't tell 'em that.

09:44.031 --> 09:45.688
- I'm gonna have to.

09:46.862 --> 09:48.657
- You carry the worry for them.

09:50.037 --> 09:51.245
That's your job.

09:51.245 --> 09:54.248
Otherwise this whole
thing starts to unravel.

09:54.248 --> 09:59.081
And trust me, panic will
spread faster than the poison.

09:59.081 --> 10:02.429
[elevator bell ringing]

10:04.017 --> 10:08.642
[people speaking indistinctly]

10:08.642 --> 10:11.507
[dramatic music]

10:27.834 --> 10:30.181
- All right, boys and girls,

10:31.734 --> 10:34.806
the plan is as follows.

10:36.843 --> 10:39.949
We start with Litvinenko

10:39.949 --> 10:42.400
and we work
backwards from there.

10:44.091 --> 10:48.544
If there's Polonium
at the house, as we
think there will be,

10:49.614 --> 10:51.616
our next question is,

10:51.616 --> 10:53.549
where was he prior to that?

10:54.792 --> 10:55.620
We go there.

10:57.001 --> 10:58.588
If there's Polonium there too,

10:59.797 --> 11:00.729
we go back again.

11:02.109 --> 11:06.735
And we keep on checking
until we find where it stops.

11:08.564 --> 11:09.945
The place it first happened.

11:11.774 --> 11:15.744
We identify the person or
persons present at that place

11:16.814 --> 11:18.022
and we have our suspect.

11:19.644 --> 11:23.096
We follow the poison,
we find a poisoner.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.649
[all laughing]

11:24.649 --> 11:27.790
[police sirens blaring]

11:27.790 --> 11:29.896
Look, we'll take this on,

11:31.621 --> 11:34.107
not because we promise
the British citizen

11:34.107 --> 11:36.730
that's what we do,
although we have.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.595
Not because we got the backing

11:39.595 --> 11:42.840
of the best scientists in
the world, although we do.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.465
But because it's our duty.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.089
Yes, there are unknowables.

11:52.401 --> 11:54.437
But dealing with
unknowables is what you do.

11:54.437 --> 11:55.715
It's what you're good at.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.372
It's why I choose
you to work here.

11:58.372 --> 12:01.513
[dramatic music]

12:01.513 --> 12:02.963
That said,

12:02.963 --> 12:06.415
if there's anyone in this
room that doesn't fancy this,

12:07.657 --> 12:09.729
you're welcome to step away.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.868
[dramatic music]

12:10.868 --> 12:12.076
This is your chance.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.597
No judgment, no one will
hold anything against you.

12:16.597 --> 12:18.910
[dramatic music]

12:18.910 --> 12:20.325
You have to speak up now.

12:21.223 --> 12:24.053
[dramatic music]

12:26.953 --> 12:27.781
Right.

12:29.058 --> 12:30.853
Don't fuck this up.

13:23.043 --> 13:26.633
[dramatic music]

13:26.633 --> 13:29.947
[alpha machine buzzing]

13:32.397 --> 13:35.124
[dramatic music]

13:40.060 --> 13:43.408
[alpha machine buzzing]

13:44.616 --> 13:47.447
[dramatic music]

13:58.941 --> 14:02.842
- [Litvinenko Voiceover]
I have pain in stomach.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.224
[alpha machine buzzing]

14:07.087 --> 14:09.158
Foam in mouth, I am sick.

14:11.195 --> 14:14.129
Been poisoned, I know this.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.165
[alpha machine beeping]

14:16.165 --> 14:17.718
- Yeah, this is good.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.238
- If we hadn't found
plenum at the house,

14:20.238 --> 14:21.170
it'd be something more.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.241
- That is what he told us.

14:23.241 --> 14:24.864
He takes us through
everything on these,

14:24.864 --> 14:27.763
including the stuff about
Scaramella, Lugovoi and Kovtun.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.454
He was adamant that
it was one of those.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.215
- We're gonna search everywhere,

14:31.215 --> 14:32.872
all the places he's been.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.459
Treating them all the same.

14:34.459 --> 14:35.357
- Even the motel?

14:35.357 --> 14:37.014
- [Clive] Everywhere.

14:37.014 --> 14:38.532
- You don't believe him?

14:38.532 --> 14:41.018
- I'm just not taking his
word for it, that's all.

14:41.018 --> 14:42.433
- Because he's ex KGB.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.400
- Because we never take
any one person's word

14:44.400 --> 14:45.470
for anything, do we?

14:46.678 --> 14:48.025
We check for ourselves.

14:49.129 --> 14:50.406
Test everything.

14:50.406 --> 14:52.477
Every one, which
includes the two of you.

14:52.477 --> 14:53.306
- Please.

14:54.617 --> 14:56.033
- You were with him the most.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.484
You'll need the all clear.

14:59.484 --> 15:01.521
I'm not having you
put a team in danger.

15:05.490 --> 15:08.562
[telephone ringing]

15:08.562 --> 15:09.770
- Scaramella.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.255
- Ah, you got him?

15:11.255 --> 15:12.635
- Well, he's back in Italy now,

15:12.635 --> 15:14.085
but he's a regular in London

15:14.085 --> 15:16.053
and he's definitely
got ties to Russia.

15:16.053 --> 15:17.951
- But we've got him as an
in intelligence analyst,

15:17.951 --> 15:20.989
he's big on nuclear energy in
the KGB's influence overseas.

15:20.989 --> 15:22.922
- So he anti KGB?

15:22.922 --> 15:23.888
- Well he might be.

15:23.888 --> 15:25.717
But then so was Litvinenko.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.686
So if you're trying to arrange
a lunch with Litvinenko.

15:28.686 --> 15:31.137
- Being anti KGB doesn't hurt.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.208
All right, let's find him.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.726
- What, as been me personally?

15:36.349 --> 15:37.384
- Is that all right Tubs?

15:37.384 --> 15:39.145
- Well, I'm not on this job gov.

15:39.145 --> 15:40.767
It's just a favor for Duncan.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.527
- Oh, what you doing?

15:42.527 --> 15:43.356
- Now?

15:44.495 --> 15:47.325
I'm waiting on feedback
on the report on 77.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.672
- Oh right, well
why you waiting.

15:50.708 --> 15:53.780
[people speaking indistinctly]

15:53.780 --> 15:54.954
- You're welcome Tubs.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.956
[gentle upbeat music]

15:56.956 --> 16:00.407
[speaking indistinctly]

16:01.753 --> 16:03.203
- [Reporter] Scotland
Yard detectors

16:03.203 --> 16:05.619
are tracing the final steps
of a former Russian spy.

16:05.619 --> 16:07.069
[police sirens blaring]

16:07.069 --> 16:09.278
He was poisoned by a rare
radioactive substance.

16:09.278 --> 16:10.210
[police sirens blaring]

16:10.210 --> 16:12.247
[people speaking indistinctly]

16:12.247 --> 16:15.043
- Manager's called
Martin Spencer.

16:15.043 --> 16:16.527
Says he has followed the
whole thing on the news

16:16.527 --> 16:17.735
since it started.

16:17.735 --> 16:19.909
Seems rather keen to help.

16:19.909 --> 16:20.980
- Oh, good.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.085
- Kovtun, yes, I remember.

16:23.085 --> 16:25.398
But he was quite a low-key guy.

16:25.398 --> 16:26.847
- Who kept himself to himself.

16:26.847 --> 16:28.090
- Exactly.

16:28.090 --> 16:31.024
But Lugovoi,

16:31.024 --> 16:34.062
Lugovoi walked around as
if he owned the place.

16:34.062 --> 16:35.166
- Arrogant.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.961
- In my view, yes.

16:36.961 --> 16:38.204
- And can you confirm

16:38.204 --> 16:40.068
they were here on the
dates we've given you?

16:41.414 --> 16:46.005
- Lugovoi, room
441, Kovtun, 382.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.972
- May we have that as
a printout, Martin?

16:47.972 --> 16:48.800
- Yep.

16:51.976 --> 16:56.291
Now there is no CCTV in
the Pine Bar, nothing.

16:57.878 --> 16:59.259
Who knows,

16:59.259 --> 17:00.847
maybe that's why they chose it.

17:02.642 --> 17:05.265
- And what about the
rest of the hotel?

17:05.265 --> 17:06.818
Do you still have
the CCTV for that?

17:06.818 --> 17:09.338
- Yeah, that of
course we can check.

17:09.338 --> 17:10.581
- Yeah, thank you Martin.

17:12.203 --> 17:13.411
- You want me to
do that right now?

17:13.411 --> 17:14.516
- Yes, please, Martin.

17:16.449 --> 17:18.520
- [Dr. Onome] And how
am I spelling Hyatt?

17:18.520 --> 17:22.903
- [Brent] Hotel Yankee
Alpha, Tango, Tango.

17:22.903 --> 17:23.732
- Thank you.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.873
Any nausea at all?

17:26.873 --> 17:28.150
Upset stomach?

17:28.150 --> 17:29.255
- No.

17:29.255 --> 17:31.291
- And how about your partner?

17:31.291 --> 17:33.086
- [Brent] She's fine, thanks.

17:33.086 --> 17:33.949
- Your children?

17:37.125 --> 17:38.678
Do you have children?

17:38.678 --> 17:40.956
- Well, we're hoping to.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.063
Will this,

17:46.306 --> 17:48.653
could this affect?

17:48.653 --> 17:50.759
- That depends.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.831
How much time did you
and Detective Dawson

17:53.831 --> 17:56.730
spend with Mr. Litvinenko?

17:56.730 --> 17:59.630
Are we talking seconds,
minutes, hours?

- [Clive] There.

19:20.089 --> 19:21.090
Lugovoi.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.126
- Yeah, definitely.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.406
- [Clive] And these people?

19:26.406 --> 19:27.856
- They were all with him.

19:27.856 --> 19:31.342
Mr. Lugovoi booked room
441, a family suite.

[dramatic music]

19:44.838 --> 19:45.770
- Gov?

19:45.770 --> 19:46.944
- Positive reading at Itsu.

19:46.944 --> 19:48.842
- What'd you make of all this?

19:48.842 --> 19:51.604
[dramatic music]

19:51.604 --> 19:54.883
- I'm thinking, if I was
sent to assassinate someone,

19:54.883 --> 19:56.471
with the most toxic
substance in the world,

19:56.471 --> 19:58.197
would I really bring
the wife and kids?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.128
- Fair point.

19:59.128 --> 20:00.958
- Doesn't mean you stop though.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.029
And we'll read copies
of all them tapes, yes?

20:03.029 --> 20:03.857
- Yes, Gov.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.033
- And just one final question,

20:07.033 --> 20:08.724
how do I say thank
you in Italian.

20:10.416 --> 20:12.003
Oh, grazie mille, Manuela.

20:13.557 --> 20:16.836
[gentle upbeat music]

20:20.357 --> 20:21.599
- [Clive] Timmons.

20:21.599 --> 20:22.773
- We have a number
for Scaramella.

20:22.773 --> 20:24.464
I just got off the
phone with the Italians,

20:24.464 --> 20:26.052
maybe they could
nick him for us.

20:26.052 --> 20:28.503
- No one's nicking anyone Tubs.

20:28.503 --> 20:30.850
If we do that we'll need
European arrest warrants

20:30.850 --> 20:31.782
and all sorts.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.059
And by the time all that sorted,

20:33.059 --> 20:35.717
you and me will be an
home, you especially.

20:35.717 --> 20:36.994
- Yeah.

20:36.994 --> 20:37.788
- [Clive] Does he
know we're onto him?

20:37.788 --> 20:38.616
- No.

20:38.616 --> 20:39.893
- Good.

20:39.893 --> 20:41.723
Send me his number,
I'll ring him myself.

20:41.723 --> 20:42.551
- [Tubs] Where are you?

20:43.587 --> 20:45.174
- Bond Street.

20:45.174 --> 20:46.693
- You're just gonna ring him
in the middle of the street?

20:46.693 --> 20:49.282
- Tubs, this is London.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.112
The only thing
anyone's interested in
here is themselves.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.221

[gentle upbeat music]

21:00.500 --> 21:01.984
[car horns honking]

21:01.984 --> 21:03.400
- [Scientist] We had positive
readings at the house,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.264
but those were secondary,
meaning Polonium wasn't present.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.231
But someone or something

21:07.231 --> 21:09.026
that had been in
contact with it was.

21:09.026 --> 21:09.854
- Litvinenko.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.582
- Which actually means, because
Polonium itself was absent,

21:13.582 --> 21:15.481
you can eliminate
the wife and son.

21:16.551 --> 21:20.348
Here though, the
readings are far higher.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.007
There was Polonium right here.

21:26.250 --> 21:30.496
[people speaking indistinctly]

21:30.496 --> 21:31.945
- He's the one who found it.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.153
- [Scientist] Yeah.

21:33.153 --> 21:34.914
- He's one of mine,
is he all right?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.573
- Well he's worried his sleeve
wasn't taped up properly.

21:38.573 --> 21:39.815
- So what next?

21:39.815 --> 21:41.334
- Well next we're getting tested

21:41.334 --> 21:44.268
and if everything's okay,
which we hope it will be,

21:44.268 --> 21:46.201
he'll be back at work
in a few days time.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.446
[people speaking indistinctly]

21:49.446 --> 21:51.068
- [Clive] And if not?

21:51.068 --> 21:52.621
- [Scientist] Jump to think.

21:52.621 --> 21:55.693
[cellphone beeping]

21:58.317 --> 22:00.146
- Mr. Scaramella.

22:00.146 --> 22:04.288
I'm calling about your late
friend, Alexander Litvinenko.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.637
No, no, it's been a real shock.

22:10.398 --> 22:12.089
No, no your English
is very good.

22:14.505 --> 22:17.128
Well, between you and
me, Mr. Scaramella,

22:17.128 --> 22:20.787
there's some individuals
we're very keen to talk to.

22:22.962 --> 22:23.894
[dramatic music]

22:23.894 --> 22:25.102
- [Pilot] Ladies and gentlemen,

22:25.102 --> 22:26.414
we're now willing to
our descent into London.

22:26.414 --> 22:29.037

[dramatic music]

22:31.315 --> 22:35.319
[people speaking indistinctly]

22:48.297 --> 22:51.715
- Mr. Scaramella, I'm Detective
Chief Inspector Duncan Ball.

22:51.715 --> 22:52.509
- What?

22:53.717 --> 22:55.512
Wait, this is arrest?

22:55.512 --> 22:56.720
- This is not an arrest.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.273
- I come here for Clive Timmons.

22:58.273 --> 22:59.239
- [Duncan] We know that.

22:59.239 --> 23:00.827
- I come to help the inquiry.

23:00.827 --> 23:01.828
- And we've come to make sure

23:01.828 --> 23:03.036
that you don't change your mind.

23:04.452 --> 23:07.524

23:28.855 --> 23:32.583
[speaks in foreign language]

23:35.103 --> 23:36.345
- [Anatoly] Does he stay here?

23:36.345 --> 23:37.416
- No, no, no, no,

23:37.416 --> 23:39.279
he has a house in in Ascot.

23:39.279 --> 23:42.973
But he did say he will
give you both a call, so.

23:44.319 --> 23:48.150
[speaks in foreign language]

23:50.498 --> 23:51.706
- Is it both of us, yes?

23:54.743 --> 23:57.125
[gentle music]

24:37.648 --> 24:38.477
[alpha machine beeping]

24:38.477 --> 24:39.892
- That makes sense.

24:39.892 --> 24:41.997
That's the table he
said they were sat at.

24:43.447 --> 24:45.553
So it's looking like he's been
poisoned at the sushi place,

24:45.553 --> 24:49.488
then walked over to the hotel,
left deposits of it there.

24:50.696 --> 24:54.493
Yeah, got 'em all, all
30 tapes ready to go.

24:57.323 --> 24:59.567

including his card
and account number.

- I'm not on this job.

25:06.194 --> 25:07.160
- Clive said you'd say that.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.403
And that when you did,

25:08.403 --> 25:09.991
I was to keep holding
that the piece of paper

25:09.991 --> 25:11.648
until you gave in and took it.

25:12.787 --> 25:14.513
[people speaking indistinctly]

25:14.513 --> 25:15.893
- [Reporter] In
University College

25:15.893 --> 25:18.206
and now being you
examined for radiation.

25:18.206 --> 25:21.278
The staff there tested in
case they've been exposed.

25:21.278 --> 25:23.107
Polonium-210 has been just
up on the laboratory shelf.

25:23.107 --> 25:24.108
- Thank you.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.768
- [Reporter] It's
extremely rare and exotic

25:28.768 --> 25:32.496
and an extraordinarily
potent radioactive isotope.

25:32.496 --> 25:35.188
- We know you know
about Polonium, Mario,

25:35.188 --> 25:37.225
you've mentioned it in
your intelligence reports.

25:37.225 --> 25:41.436
The question is, what
was it doing downstairs

25:41.436 --> 25:43.403
at the Itsu restaurant?

25:43.403 --> 25:46.303
Why would we find it, Mario?

25:46.303 --> 25:47.131
- Because of Sasha.

25:47.131 --> 25:48.685
- Because of Sasha.

25:48.685 --> 25:49.996
Here's one theory,

25:49.996 --> 25:51.688
you took the Polonium to Itsu

25:51.688 --> 25:53.137
because Sasha was
gonna be there.

25:53.137 --> 25:54.035
- No.

25:54.035 --> 25:55.312
- Eat there.
- No.

25:55.312 --> 25:56.520
- You arranged to
meet him at Itsu.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.763
And once you got
your food upstairs,

25:57.763 --> 26:00.766
you poisoned him in
a booth downstairs.

26:00.766 --> 26:01.870
- I come here to help you.

26:01.870 --> 26:02.837
- So help.

26:04.493 --> 26:07.496
Explain how it's possible
that you were at Itsu,

26:07.496 --> 26:10.672
Sasha was at Itsu, we
found Polonium Itsu,

26:10.672 --> 26:12.950
in the place where
you were sitting.

26:17.506 --> 26:18.611
- It was poison already.

26:18.611 --> 26:19.474
- No.
- Yes.

26:19.474 --> 26:20.855
It's the only way.

26:20.855 --> 26:22.097
- Oh really?

26:22.097 --> 26:24.237
Because prior to
meeting you that day,

26:24.237 --> 26:26.032
the day he was poisoned,

26:26.032 --> 26:28.587
the only place Sasha
had been was his house.

26:30.002 --> 26:33.281
And we found no primary
radiation there whatsoever.

26:33.281 --> 26:35.214
- Why were you so keen
to meet him for lunch?

26:35.214 --> 26:36.698
Why were you so insistent?

26:36.698 --> 26:39.805
- Because I worry
for Sasha, for me.

26:39.805 --> 26:41.910
- Because you thought
you were both targets?

26:41.910 --> 26:43.325
- Si.

26:43.325 --> 26:44.741
Sasha is my friend.

26:46.087 --> 26:47.364
He trusts me.

26:52.749 --> 26:54.405
- [Litvinenko Voiceover]
What else can I talk?

26:54.405 --> 26:56.476
Scaramella is little bit,

26:59.341 --> 27:00.446
He is madman.

27:01.689 --> 27:03.552
- [Brent] To be
clear, Scaramella

27:04.899 --> 27:06.970
might have been the
person sent to poison you?

27:08.868 --> 27:11.630
- [Litvinenko Voiceover]
It is possible.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.942
- Let's not take his
word for it, Mario,

27:15.047 --> 27:17.256
let's have you tested today.

27:17.256 --> 27:19.292
Let's have the hotel room
you staying in tested.

27:19.292 --> 27:22.399
- It's room 763 at
the Thistle Victoria.

27:22.399 --> 27:23.849
- And while we're at it,

27:23.849 --> 27:25.816
let's find out where else
you've been in London.

27:27.369 --> 27:30.407
So we gonna have those
places tested too

27:30.407 --> 27:32.892
and find out just
how possible it is.

27:34.549 --> 27:37.379
[dramatic music]

27:42.557 --> 27:45.491
- Gov, urine testing
takes at least 24 hours.

27:45.491 --> 27:47.666
Well that's what they told
Brent Hyatt and Jim Dawson.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.047
- Well, everyone else
is gonna have to wait.

27:50.047 --> 27:52.912
Oh, Mario needs to go at
the front of the queue.

27:52.912 --> 27:54.707
I'll get our team
down to his hotel.

27:56.053 --> 27:58.780
[dramatic music]

28:00.955 --> 28:04.061
[car engine revving]

28:04.061 --> 28:06.788
[dramatic music]

28:10.585 --> 28:14.727
[people speaking indistinctly]

28:14.727 --> 28:17.868
[car engine revving]

28:17.868 --> 28:20.664
[dramatic music]

28:44.136 --> 28:47.484
[alpha machine buzzing]

28:49.210 --> 28:51.730
[upbeat music]

28:51.730 --> 28:54.905
[cellphone vibrating]

28:56.735 --> 28:58.495
[people speaking indistinctly]

28:58.495 --> 29:00.048
[cellphone vibrating]

29:00.048 --> 29:02.499
- A radiation alert
is sparked in London,

29:02.499 --> 29:04.673
as it's revealed the
Russian spy was poisoned

29:04.673 --> 29:06.330
with radioactive material.

29:06.330 --> 29:09.092
- Well, she's got that
wrong for starters.

29:09.092 --> 29:10.265
He wasn't Russian, was he?

29:10.265 --> 29:12.026
He was British.

29:12.026 --> 29:14.062
- [Reporter] Are
now being monitored.

29:14.062 --> 29:16.064
Then it emerged
that it wasn't only.

29:16.064 --> 29:16.893
- Gov.

29:18.342 --> 29:19.896
Lugovoi.

29:19.896 --> 29:21.035
Here, watch.

29:22.588 --> 29:27.420
He comes from here, the Pine
Bar, and makes a call at 15:38.

29:27.420 --> 29:30.113
The clock behind reception
confirms it, look.

29:30.113 --> 29:32.080
It's the exact same time
that Sasha told Brent

29:32.080 --> 29:34.013
they spoke on the phone.

29:34.013 --> 29:35.635
The call ends.

29:35.635 --> 29:37.051
- [Clive] Kovtun.

29:37.051 --> 29:37.879
- They talk.

29:39.432 --> 29:40.261
And then

29:41.883 --> 29:42.746
the gents.

29:44.921 --> 29:45.784
- [Tubs] And?

29:47.716 --> 29:50.512
- Tubs, men don't go to
the toilets together.

29:50.512 --> 29:51.928
Well, in a nightclub maybe,

29:51.928 --> 29:54.862
but not in a hotel on
a Wednesday afternoon.

29:54.862 --> 29:56.104
[police sirens blaring]

29:56.104 --> 29:57.416
Now out comes Lugovoi,

29:59.107 --> 30:00.315
pats his pocket.

30:00.315 --> 30:02.593
- As if he's got
something in there.

30:02.593 --> 30:05.527
- [Duncan] And he's back to
the bar to wait for Litvinenko.

30:07.288 --> 30:09.462
- [Reporter] And an
extraordinarily potent.

30:10.878 --> 30:14.053
It would have to be made to
order by someone with access.

30:14.053 --> 30:16.573
- However much we'd rather
it was the Russians,

30:16.573 --> 30:17.885
over the tubby Italian.

30:18.989 --> 30:20.508
We've got Polonium in Itsu,

30:20.508 --> 30:22.579
before these boys even
enter the picture.

30:24.029 --> 30:25.754
No, and none of
this changes that.

30:26.894 --> 30:29.758
[dramatic music]

30:32.865 --> 30:34.729
- Now put it back.

30:34.729 --> 30:37.559
[dramatic music]

31:04.759 --> 31:07.866
[telephone ringing]

31:13.872 --> 31:14.700
- Timmons.

31:15.528 --> 31:18.428
[dramatic music]

31:18.428 --> 31:19.567
Tell me.

31:19.567 --> 31:22.328
[dramatic music]

31:24.572 --> 31:26.332
All right, thank you.

31:27.782 --> 31:30.509
[dramatic music]

31:51.047 --> 31:53.325
[telephones ringing]

31:53.325 --> 31:54.636
[people speaking indistinctly]

31:54.636 --> 31:55.706
[police sirens blaring]

31:55.706 --> 31:56.915
[people speaking indistinctly]

31:56.915 --> 31:59.952
[cellphone ringing]

32:01.126 --> 32:02.161
- Gov.

32:02.161 --> 32:02.955
- [Clive] Are they still going?

32:02.955 --> 32:03.783
- Just finishing up now.

32:03.783 --> 32:04.750
- Right.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.234
Go to the foyer,

32:06.234 --> 32:08.202
have them get those little
dust buster things ready

32:08.202 --> 32:09.341
and call me back, yeah.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.586
[people speaking indistinctly]

32:13.586 --> 32:15.002
[car engine revving]

32:15.002 --> 32:17.245
- [Tubs] I've got
Lugovoi's credit card bill.

32:18.902 --> 32:19.903
Interesting reading.

32:21.456 --> 32:22.871
- Scaramella's clean.

32:23.803 --> 32:27.221
His hotel room, his urine.

32:27.221 --> 32:28.670
- [Duncan] Not even secondary.

32:28.670 --> 32:31.639
- Nothing, total dead end.

32:31.639 --> 32:33.434
- Clive, forget Scaramella.

32:35.539 --> 32:37.714
Right, according to this,

32:37.714 --> 32:39.233
Lugovoi has used the
same card for everything.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.200
He's paid the hotel bill,
the one Deborah gave me,

32:41.200 --> 32:44.100
he's done shopping, bars,

32:44.100 --> 32:47.103
and he's also used it on a trip
to London two weeks earlier

32:47.103 --> 32:51.176
and on the 16th of
October on Piccadilly.

32:52.349 --> 32:54.558
He's used it to
buy food from Itsu.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.871
[dramatic music]

32:56.871 --> 32:58.459
- It's definitely
two weeks prior

32:58.459 --> 33:00.288
and it's definitely
the right Itsu?

33:00.288 --> 33:01.496
- Yeah.

33:01.496 --> 33:04.568
[cellphone ringing]

33:06.432 --> 33:07.606
- You in the foyer?

33:07.606 --> 33:08.745
- Yes, Gov.

33:08.745 --> 33:10.126
- [Clive] Right.

33:10.126 --> 33:13.094
Stand in the middle by
yourself, facing the entrance.

33:13.094 --> 33:15.579
Now that's 12 o'clock,
turn to your left

33:16.442 --> 33:17.788
and face to 10.

33:17.788 --> 33:19.100
You see a door?

33:19.100 --> 33:20.308
- Yes, Gov.

33:20.308 --> 33:21.240
- Right, that's a gents.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.380
Tell them to check in the gents.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.382
[dramatic music]

33:25.382 --> 33:27.902
What is it about Itsu
they like so much.

33:27.902 --> 33:29.283
- That's just it,
Gov, it's not them,

33:29.283 --> 33:31.354
it's Litvinenko, it's
where he liked to meet.

33:31.354 --> 33:34.667
- So if they were there,
they were there to meet him.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.429
[dramatic music]

33:59.002 --> 34:01.729
[dramatic music]

34:02.868 --> 34:06.147
[alpha machine buzzing]

34:08.494 --> 34:11.221
[dramatic music]

34:16.054 --> 34:19.643
[alpha machine buzzing]

34:19.643 --> 34:21.300
[dramatic music]

34:21.300 --> 34:22.991
[cellphone ringing]

34:22.991 --> 34:24.165
- Yep.

34:24.165 --> 34:25.787
- [Deborah] They're
saying it's FSD.

34:25.787 --> 34:26.685
- Meaning?

34:26.685 --> 34:27.893
- Full Scale Deflection.

34:27.893 --> 34:30.378
Apparently that's as
radioactive as it gets.

34:30.378 --> 34:32.035
- That's it.

34:32.035 --> 34:32.863
Thank you.

34:37.799 --> 34:39.284
Right.

34:39.284 --> 34:40.319
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:41.803 --> 34:44.944
these are our boys.

34:47.464 --> 34:49.190
They come over,

34:49.190 --> 34:52.193
they meet Sasha at Itsu

34:52.193 --> 34:53.781
and they try to whack him there.

34:53.781 --> 34:54.678
- But they fail.

34:54.678 --> 34:55.610
- Yes.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.165
But that explains our findings.

34:58.165 --> 35:02.169
Two weeks later,
they come back again,

35:02.169 --> 35:04.205
only this time they bring
their families with them

35:04.205 --> 35:06.207
so as not to seem
too suspicious.

35:07.657 --> 35:11.971
However, this time they
want him to come to them,

35:13.180 --> 35:17.425
to do it on their turf,
on on their terms.

35:17.425 --> 35:19.565
So as they won't screw
it up a second time.

35:21.395 --> 35:22.534
But when he gets there.

35:22.534 --> 35:24.087
- [Duncan] Gov.

35:24.087 --> 35:26.917
[dramatic music]

35:32.130 --> 35:34.062
- When he gets there,
they're waiting.

35:35.512 --> 35:40.241
They have the poison, they
have the CCTV blind spot.

35:41.449 --> 35:43.451
They've even ordered
a pot of green tea.

35:45.246 --> 35:50.251
All they need now is for
Sasha Litvinenko to turn up,

35:52.288 --> 35:53.151
sit down.

35:57.085 --> 35:57.914
And take a sip.

35:58.811 --> 36:01.573
[dramatic music]

36:03.299 --> 36:05.715
[bells ringing]

36:05.715 --> 36:09.063
[wind gushing]

36:09.063 --> 36:10.375
- I thought it might
be worth giving you

36:10.375 --> 36:12.031
the Russian angle on this.

36:13.447 --> 36:16.277
If a Russian citizen is deemed
to be an enemy of the state,

36:16.277 --> 36:18.866
then no matter where in
the world he happens to be,

36:18.866 --> 36:22.525
he is under their rules,
at least fair game.

36:22.525 --> 36:23.802
- That's not what this is.

36:23.802 --> 36:26.667
- Litvinenko had been
stirring things up.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.013
Before Putin even got in,

36:28.013 --> 36:30.153
he'd as good as branded
him a war criminal.

36:31.844 --> 36:34.813
He had also been doing some
work for us, between you and me.

36:34.813 --> 36:36.987
So I don't wanna say the
man was asking for trouble.

36:36.987 --> 36:37.954
- That system

36:37.954 --> 36:39.197
doesn't apply.
- But he was

36:39.197 --> 36:40.922
asking for trouble.
- Because Litvinenko

36:40.922 --> 36:42.130
wasn't Russian.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.028
- He was KGB.

36:43.028 --> 36:43.822
- [Peter] Ex.

36:43.822 --> 36:44.754
- No such thing.

36:44.754 --> 36:45.720
- And a citizen of this country.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.205
- For about five minutes.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.482
There's stuff in my fridge

36:48.482 --> 36:50.863
that's been British
longer than he has.

36:50.863 --> 36:53.418
- If we don't draw the line
here, it's open season.

36:54.626 --> 36:56.214
Anyone from any country

36:56.214 --> 36:58.319
can do their dirty
work on our patch.

36:58.319 --> 37:01.633
He lived here, had
his family here.

37:01.633 --> 37:03.462
He also, in case
you'd forgotten,

37:03.462 --> 37:05.844
did a fair amount
of work for you.

37:05.844 --> 37:07.363
So he must be protected

37:07.363 --> 37:09.261
under the laws of
the United Kingdom.

37:11.367 --> 37:12.230
Surely.

37:15.336 --> 37:17.580
- How about we start
this conversation again?

37:20.445 --> 37:24.276
[speaks in foreign language]

37:26.105 --> 37:27.314
- Mom.

37:27.314 --> 37:28.522
- [Translator] There
was no indication

37:28.522 --> 37:29.868
it was a violent
death in the report.

37:29.868 --> 37:31.110
- Mom.

37:31.110 --> 37:31.835
- [Translator] By
British doctors.

37:31.835 --> 37:33.216
It's not there.

37:33.216 --> 37:37.047
[speaks in foreign language]

37:38.359 --> 37:39.602
- [Translator] For Litvinenko,

37:39.602 --> 37:40.844
then why was it not
published earlier?

37:40.844 --> 37:42.260
If it was written
after his death,

37:42.260 --> 37:44.262
then there is no
need to comment.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.401
[speaks in foreign language]

37:45.401 --> 37:48.369
We knew that Litvinenko
is not Lazarus.

37:48.369 --> 37:52.270
[speaks in foreign language]

37:52.270 --> 37:54.824
[gentle music]

37:58.310 --> 38:02.452
[speaks in foreign language]

38:02.452 --> 38:05.075
[gentle music]

38:11.254 --> 38:12.255
- Putin.

38:12.255 --> 38:15.983
[speaks in foreign language]

38:20.988 --> 38:23.818
[dramatic music]

38:25.924 --> 38:28.167
- Andrei Lugovoi
and Dmitry Kovtun

38:28.167 --> 38:30.929
flew back to Russia on
the 3rd of November.

38:30.929 --> 38:33.621
It is not enough to know
that these are our men.

38:33.621 --> 38:37.107
What we have to do now is
secure physical evidence

38:37.107 --> 38:40.973
that links them and only
them to the Polonium.

38:42.389 --> 38:44.908
- The readings from the Pine
Bar are pretty conclusive.

38:44.908 --> 38:48.256
- But where did they
go that Sasha didn't.

38:48.256 --> 38:51.605
- Lugovoi went to a match,
Arsenal versus CSK Moscow.

38:51.605 --> 38:53.123
That was the night of the first.

38:53.123 --> 38:56.092
- Yeah, they ate in a place
called Pescatore, night after.

38:56.092 --> 38:57.265
- We'll have those
checked today.

38:57.265 --> 38:58.232
- And you should.

38:58.232 --> 38:59.716
But for us,

38:59.716 --> 39:03.513
anything that comes after they
met Litvinenko doesn't work

39:03.513 --> 39:06.378
because the radiation could
still have come from him.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.553
So, where were they before?

39:08.553 --> 39:11.349
That's what we need
to make this stick.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.525
[telephones ringing]

39:17.078 --> 39:19.771
- What about the
airplane they came in on?

39:19.771 --> 39:22.049
It's not as if they
could deny being on that.

39:23.602 --> 39:25.155
- Thank you.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.847
That's it.

39:26.847 --> 39:29.436
That becomes our top priority.

39:29.436 --> 39:30.298
Good work.

39:31.576 --> 39:35.649
[people speaking indistinctly]

39:35.649 --> 39:37.892
- [Reporter] In a statement
made earlier today,

39:37.892 --> 39:40.481
President Putin played
down any suggestion

39:40.481 --> 39:41.862
of Russian involvement.

39:41.862 --> 39:42.725
Also passing doubt.

39:42.725 --> 39:45.003
[cellphone ringing]

39:45.003 --> 39:46.211
- Hello.

39:46.211 --> 39:48.006
- [Dr. Onome] Detective Hyatt.

39:48.006 --> 39:48.938
- Speaking.

39:48.938 --> 39:50.836
- This is Dr. Onome George,

39:50.836 --> 39:53.183
calling from Public
Health England.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.668
I have some results for you.

39:55.841 --> 39:58.326
I'm pleased to inform
you that your sample

39:58.326 --> 39:59.983
has come back negative.

39:59.983 --> 40:02.158
[sighing]

40:03.331 --> 40:05.748
- And Jim Dawson, my colleague?

40:05.748 --> 40:06.956
- [Dr. Onome] I'm afraid

40:06.956 --> 40:09.199
I can't really go
into details on that.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.408
- Of course.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.065
- Though, I can tell
you I'm about to make

40:13.065 --> 40:16.448
a very similar call to Detective
Dawson in just one second.

40:16.448 --> 40:17.311
[gentle music]

40:17.311 --> 40:19.313
[laughing]

40:19.313 --> 40:20.279
- Thank you.

40:20.279 --> 40:21.867
- [Dr. Onome] Okay.

40:22.834 --> 40:24.560
- Yeah, thank you.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.526
- [Dr. Onome] You take care now.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.596
- Okay, bye.

40:26.596 --> 40:28.322
- [Dr. Onome] Bye-Bye.

40:28.322 --> 40:30.911
[gentle music]

40:34.328 --> 40:36.641
[laughing]

40:39.885 --> 40:41.439
- I'm heading in.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.027
- You want me to leave
something in the fridge tonight?

40:44.027 --> 40:45.857
- No, let's eat together.

40:45.857 --> 40:47.721
[gentle music]

40:47.721 --> 40:49.550
It's a good night
for an early night.

40:50.551 --> 40:53.209
[gentle music]

41:00.906 --> 41:04.738
- Okay, BA 873 is the
one they flew in on.

41:04.738 --> 41:07.465
Seats 23C and 23D.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.466
- Right.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.122
Where is it now?

41:10.122 --> 41:11.883
- Well, it's changed
flight number of course.

41:11.883 --> 41:14.817
But the plane itself with
that registration mark

41:14.817 --> 41:19.235
is currently
Heathrow, Terminal 2.

41:20.719 --> 41:22.514
- You mean it's here, right now.

41:23.826 --> 41:24.758
[dramatic music]

41:24.758 --> 41:27.243
[airplane engine roaring]

[camera shutter clicking]

41:53.580 --> 41:56.410
[dramatic music]

42:05.108 --> 42:07.939
- Confirm contamination
on seat 23D.

42:07.939 --> 42:08.767
- 23D was.

42:09.906 --> 42:11.529
- Lugovoi.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.117
[telephone ringing]

42:14.117 --> 42:16.741
[dramatic music]

42:16.741 --> 42:18.294
- Gov.

42:18.294 --> 42:19.122
We've got it.

42:20.020 --> 42:21.090
Clear evidence.

42:21.090 --> 42:23.057
It was Lugovoi and Kovtun.

42:23.057 --> 42:24.990
They came to the
country fully loaded.

42:24.990 --> 42:27.614
It's enough, in my opinion,
to apply for extradition.

42:28.684 --> 42:30.271
Do I make the
application or do you?

42:30.271 --> 42:31.203
- Clive.

42:31.203 --> 42:32.480
- I think it should be you

42:32.480 --> 42:33.723
because it'll carry
more weight when it.

42:33.723 --> 42:36.070
- Clive, there'll
be no application.

42:36.070 --> 42:37.071
There's resistance.

42:37.934 --> 42:38.763
- Resistance from who?

42:38.763 --> 42:39.764
- You saw the news.

42:39.764 --> 42:40.765
- Resistance from who?

42:40.765 --> 42:42.490
- At this level,
it's not just us

42:42.490 --> 42:43.733
who need to decide
on these things.

42:43.733 --> 42:45.010
- But we need to
talk to these men.

42:45.010 --> 42:46.149
- I agree.

42:46.149 --> 42:46.943
- Interview them.
- Ideally.

42:46.943 --> 42:47.875
But on this occasion,

42:47.875 --> 42:49.118
we may have to limit ourselves

42:49.118 --> 42:51.189
to correctly identifying
the culprits.

42:51.189 --> 42:53.122
- That's not good enough.

42:53.122 --> 42:55.055
That's not the promise
we made to Marina.

42:55.055 --> 42:56.056
- That's the reality.

42:58.299 --> 43:00.439
[clock ticking]

43:00.439 --> 43:02.131
- Answer me this.

43:02.131 --> 43:04.651
Are they saying we
can't speak to these men

43:04.651 --> 43:06.756
or just that we
can't extradite them?

43:06.756 --> 43:07.585
Which is it, Sir?

43:10.277 --> 43:12.520
- There is no
extradition agreement

43:12.520 --> 43:15.213
between the UK and Russia.

43:15.213 --> 43:16.490
- Well, that's just something

43:16.490 --> 43:17.664
we'll have to work
around, isn't it?

43:21.840 --> 43:23.808

43:48.073 --> 43:49.419
- Where's Tubs?

43:49.419 --> 43:50.282
- In the gents Gov.

43:50.282 --> 43:51.111
- Is he now?

43:52.146 --> 43:55.494
[gentle upbeat music]

44:08.473 --> 44:10.475
- I thought we agreed men don't
go to the toilets together

44:10.475 --> 44:12.028
in the middle of the afternoon.

44:15.342 --> 44:20.036
- Tubs, I need you
to go to Moscow.

44:26.422 --> 44:29.011

of you, young man.

[telephone ringing]

44:50.653 --> 44:51.481
- Hello.

44:51.481 --> 44:52.413

- Boris?
