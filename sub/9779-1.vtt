01:48.070 --> 01:50.950
What's this war in the heart of nature?

01:54.120 --> 01:57.040
Why does nature vie with itself?.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.830
The land contend with the sea?

02:12.260 --> 02:14.970
Is there an avenging power in nature?

02:18.060 --> 02:20.350
Not one power, but two?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.720
I remember my mother when she was dying.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.140
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.600
I asked her if she was afraid.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.400
She just shook her head.

04:29.810 --> 04:32.610
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

04:34.070 --> 04:39.360
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting
about her going back to God.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.660
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.690
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.740
What it'd be like to know that this breath now
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.210
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

06:13.380 --> 06:16.000
With the same... calm.

06:19.010 --> 06:23.680
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.430
Kids around here never fight.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.970
Sometimes.

07:10.060 --> 07:13.060
Sometimes when you see them playing

07:13.140 --> 07:15.310
they always fight!

07:19.230 --> 07:21.780
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.530
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.740
- Why?
- Cos you look...

07:31.240 --> 07:33.160
You look as an army!

07:33.250 --> 07:35.330
- I look army?
- Yes.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.170
Well, that don't matter.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.970
It doesn't matter.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.510
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.560
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.460
All right, come on. Turn around.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.630
Go, go, go, go. Go!

08:27.470 --> 08:29.550
Come on, go.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.559
Go, go, go, go!

10:12.820 --> 10:15.080
Witt, patrol boat!

10:15.160 --> 10:17.240
She's American.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.220
What's it doing out here all alone?

10:56.830 --> 11:00.040
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

11:00.120 --> 11:02.410
You haven't learned a thing.

11:04.250 --> 11:08.750
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll put your head in the noose for him.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.220
How many times you been AWOL?

11:20.310 --> 11:22.930
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

11:23.020 --> 11:27.020
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

11:27.110 --> 11:29.190
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

11:29.270 --> 11:31.360
We can't all be smart.

11:32.940 --> 11:35.450
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

11:35.530 --> 11:37.620
Look at you.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.580
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.550
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in God's world.

11:54.470 --> 11:57.930
This is C Company,
of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

11:58.010 --> 12:02.850
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.770
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.150
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.740
But I worked a deal for ya.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.910
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

12:18.870 --> 12:22.200
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

12:22.290 --> 12:26.710
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I can take anything you dish out.

12:31.090 --> 12:33.420
I'm twice the man you are.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.980
In this world...

12:47.890 --> 12:51.730
a man himself is nothing.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.450
And there ain't no world but this one.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.240
You're wrong there, Top.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.120
I seen another world.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.590
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

13:21.010 --> 13:23.100
Well,

13:23.310 --> 13:25.890
then you've seen things I never will.

13:35.610 --> 13:41.070
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

13:42.030 --> 13:47.000
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.160
Look out for himself.

14:01.430 --> 14:04.140
I might be the best friend you ever had.

14:06.350 --> 14:08.430
You don't even know it.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.300
He hates you worse than poison.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.560
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.600
I love Charlie Company.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.650
They're my people.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.430
They call it "The Rock".

16:07.510 --> 16:10.760
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

16:10.850 --> 16:12.720
Fighting's confined to this area.

16:12.810 --> 16:18.400
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

16:18.480 --> 16:23.690
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.280
The Marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.830
Worked my ass off.

16:33.370 --> 16:35.460
Brown-nosed the generals.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.790
Degraded myself

16:41.670 --> 16:44.840
for them and my family.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.220
For my home.

16:48.890 --> 16:52.180
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

16:52.260 --> 16:55.230
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.390
It's OK.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.110
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

17:02.190 --> 17:05.569
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

17:05.650 --> 17:09.030
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

17:09.109 --> 17:11.200
He becomes a politician, right?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.369
Goes along to get along.

17:14.829 --> 17:18.079
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.210
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.210
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.260
Like a hawk.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.510
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.940
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

17:46.030 --> 17:50.450
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

17:50.530 --> 17:54.080
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.200
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.160
Yes, sir.

17:59.250 --> 18:05.420
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.590
I guess we don't know the bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

18:09.670 --> 18:13.760
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

18:13.850 --> 18:15.510
You're a humble man.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.850
Nobody wants that island... but you.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.440
How much do you want it?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.940
As much as I have to, sir.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.860
All they sacrificed for me

18:35.910 --> 18:38.660
poured out like water on the ground.

18:44.460 --> 18:47.380
All I might have given for love's sake.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.980
Too late.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.900
Died...

19:12.320 --> 19:14.410
slow as a tree.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.740
D'you feel it?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.540
Yes, sir.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.750
Thank you, sir.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.390
Take topside to the signal bridge.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.740
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

20:09.590 --> 20:13.050
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

20:14.090 --> 20:15.760
I can't help it. I got...

20:15.840 --> 20:19.220
My stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

20:19.300 --> 20:22.100
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

20:22.180 --> 20:25.850
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

20:25.940 --> 20:30.110
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

20:31.400 --> 20:35.240
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

20:35.320 --> 20:39.780
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

20:39.870 --> 20:43.330
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.420
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

20:47.500 --> 20:51.710
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.970
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.130
Train?

20:57.220 --> 21:02.640
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

21:02.720 --> 21:08.640
That's all you gotta worry about. This war
ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

21:08.730 --> 21:12.060
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

21:12.150 --> 21:16.900
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

21:16.990 --> 21:20.570
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.530
What d'you want me to tell you?

21:22.620 --> 21:25.660
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.210
Tell you something.

21:27.290 --> 21:31.880
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.920
I already know that.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.760
Well, brood on it, Tills.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.130
Brood on it.

21:38.220 --> 21:41.640
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

21:41.720 --> 21:46.180
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

21:46.270 --> 21:49.060
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.810
Yeah? Well, have fun.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.110
Yeah, have fun.

21:53.190 --> 21:58.030
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.740
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

22:01.820 --> 22:03.700
Open the door!

22:05.660 --> 22:08.370
You all learn to deal these cards...

22:10.500 --> 22:13.080
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.420
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

22:17.510 --> 22:21.260
All right, jack's high, jack to bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

22:24.350 --> 22:29.310
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

22:29.390 --> 22:34.190
How was I supposed to know there was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.150
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.990
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

22:44.070 --> 22:46.030
It's that captain of ours.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.910
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.460
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.230
Hello, Captain.

23:56.150 --> 23:59.940
I read in your 201 file
that you were an officer before the war.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.690
How'd you end up a private?

24:02.780 --> 24:04.860
Cos of my wife.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.820
I was in the corps of engineers.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.080
We'd never been separated before,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.250
not even for a night.

24:15.120 --> 24:19.090
I took it for four months and then I quit.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.090
Just resigned.

24:24.050 --> 24:26.800
They sent me back to the States.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.970
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

24:30.050 --> 24:35.730
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.440
Sons of bitches.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.150
No, I don't blame them.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.650
Well, where is she now?

24:46.530 --> 24:48.610
She's home.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.420
Why should i be afraid to die?

25:07.050 --> 25:08.510
I belong to you.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.600
Move! Move! Move!

25:13.680 --> 25:15.770
Move! Move!

25:22.900 --> 25:24.150
Move! Move!

25:24.230 --> 25:25.480
Moving out!

25:25.570 --> 25:29.740
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.490
On the otherside of the dark waters.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.880
Put your helmet on.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.090
Be with me now.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.640
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.310
I like you, Captain.

26:02.400 --> 26:07.900
And I just want you to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

26:07.990 --> 26:12.070
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.030
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.580
Gangway! Gangway there!

26:16.660 --> 26:18.120
Coming through!

26:18.200 --> 26:21.120
Squad leaders! Both teams!

26:21.210 --> 26:23.540
This way, son. This way, right here.

26:24.590 --> 26:26.670
Stand by to go over the side!

27:39.620 --> 27:41.700
Our Father, who art in heaven...

27:42.710 --> 27:46.580
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

27:46.670 --> 27:50.300
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.060
Your outfit's lucky.

28:05.140 --> 28:07.230
Transports must've been spotted.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.230
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

28:20.620 --> 28:23.120
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

28:53.280 --> 28:54.940
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

28:55.030 --> 28:57.110
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.740
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

28:59.820 --> 29:01.200
- A week.
- A week, sir.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.740
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

29:03.830 --> 29:06.870
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.830
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

29:11.090 --> 29:13.880
They got fish that live in trees.

29:17.470 --> 29:22.050
If they didn't know this beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

30:53.520 --> 30:57.070
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

31:29.060 --> 31:31.560
Your death that captures all.

31:37.940 --> 31:41.900
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.140
Your glory.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.520
Mercy.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.150
Peace.

32:19.110 --> 32:21.190
Truth.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.120
You give calm a spirit,

32:33.160 --> 32:35.250
understanding,

32:37.040 --> 32:39.130
courage.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.880
The contented heart.

36:26.190 --> 36:28.270
Get a medic here!

36:33.530 --> 36:38.070
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

36:40.780 --> 36:43.290
All faces of the same man.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.620
One big self.

37:20.870 --> 37:23.950
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.130
Each like a coal

37:33.210 --> 37:35.300
drawn from the fire.

38:07.330 --> 38:10.170
We're going straight up that hill there.

38:13.790 --> 38:17.920
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

38:18.010 --> 38:20.930
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

38:21.010 --> 38:24.810
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

38:27.020 --> 38:29.940
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

38:30.020 --> 38:32.440
My men are... passing out, sir.

38:40.150 --> 38:44.120
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

38:57.550 --> 39:01.630
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.100
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

39:05.180 --> 39:07.970
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.

39:19.570 --> 39:24.820
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it,
so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.030
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

39:28.120 --> 39:31.120
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

39:31.200 --> 39:36.210
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

39:40.380 --> 39:44.510
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

40:37.770 --> 40:39.860
Are you here?

40:54.160 --> 40:56.250
Let me not betray you.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.050
Let me not betray my men.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.010
In you I place my trust.

41:28.030 --> 41:30.120
Rosy-fingered dawn.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.040
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.200
D'you ever read Homer?

41:36.290 --> 41:38.830
We read Homer at the Point.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.790
In Greek.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.380
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

41:44.460 --> 41:49.050
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

41:49.130 --> 41:53.510
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.240
OK, you guys.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.990
This is it.

42:51.070 --> 42:53.570
We're going down in groups often.

42:54.990 --> 42:59.450
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

42:59.540 --> 43:01.870
run all the way.

43:01.960 --> 43:05.290
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.720
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.130
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

43:13.220 --> 43:15.930
You go organise them guys that's up there.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.940
Moving out in five minutes.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.440
Let's go.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.530
Sico?

43:33.320 --> 43:36.280
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick to my stomach.

43:36.370 --> 43:39.700
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

43:39.790 --> 43:41.580
I can't. I would if I could.

43:41.660 --> 43:44.000
I'm sick.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.960
I'm sick.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.130
You ain't sick. Get up!

43:52.420 --> 43:55.840
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

43:55.930 --> 43:59.100
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

43:59.180 --> 44:01.430
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.310
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.650
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

44:11.730 --> 44:13.820
Thank you, Sergeant.

44:16.110 --> 44:18.200
Don't argue with me.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.370
Good luck, Keck.

45:23.720 --> 45:25.810
Plug that hole on your right!

45:25.890 --> 45:27.770
Move!

45:47.460 --> 45:49.540
Maybe they pulled out.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.920
Hit dirt!

48:02.340 --> 48:04.260
Hit dirt!

48:09.350 --> 48:12.100
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

48:16.900 --> 48:18.940
Stretcher-bearers!

48:34.620 --> 48:36.290
Come on!

48:36.370 --> 48:38.460
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

48:39.540 --> 48:42.760
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

48:42.840 --> 48:46.880
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

48:46.970 --> 48:50.260
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

48:50.350 --> 48:54.430
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

48:56.390 --> 48:58.520
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

49:01.270 --> 49:02.940
Hello, First Sergeant.

49:04.690 --> 49:07.110
Who we going after over here?

49:07.910 --> 49:09.990
We think it's Jacques.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.200
Ol' Jockey.

49:12.290 --> 49:15.000
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

49:15.500 --> 49:16.960
Sir?

49:17.620 --> 49:22.920
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

49:23.760 --> 49:27.840
- OK, but you gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

49:30.890 --> 49:33.310
Nicky! You're still alive!

49:34.220 --> 49:36.100
Keep moving! Keep moving!

49:37.190 --> 49:43.190
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest
thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

49:43.270 --> 49:47.780
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

49:47.860 --> 49:50.410
Young Whyte led beautifully.

49:50.490 --> 49:52.580
Yes, sir. Over.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.540
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

49:55.620 --> 50:01.130
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think
they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

50:01.210 --> 50:04.000
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

50:04.090 --> 50:06.170
Did they knock any out?

50:06.260 --> 50:10.300
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

50:12.430 --> 50:14.720
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

50:14.810 --> 50:17.060
Here, sir. Over.

50:17.140 --> 50:22.020
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

50:22.100 --> 50:24.480
Children.

50:24.570 --> 50:27.400
I don't know, sir.

50:27.490 --> 50:31.990
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

50:32.110 --> 50:36.410
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

50:36.490 --> 50:38.830
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

50:38.910 --> 50:42.120
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.

50:42.210 --> 50:45.420
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.760
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

50:47.840 --> 50:51.180
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

50:51.260 --> 50:53.720
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

51:20.080 --> 51:22.160
Move up!

51:40.520 --> 51:41.980
Hey, Keck!

51:43.190 --> 51:45.060
Yeah!

51:45.440 --> 51:48.320
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.190
Blane's dead.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.360
You're in charge.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.450
We know you there, Yank!

52:00.240 --> 52:02.330
Tojo eats shit!

52:02.540 --> 52:05.670
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

52:41.450 --> 52:43.330
I got him! I got him!

53:01.260 --> 53:03.350
I killed a man.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.520
Hey, Queen!

53:06.230 --> 53:08.100
Queen, you there?

53:08.190 --> 53:12.230
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

53:12.320 --> 53:15.280
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

53:15.360 --> 53:19.200
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

53:19.280 --> 53:22.330
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!

53:23.660 --> 53:25.870
I'm serious!

53:25.960 --> 53:29.880
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

53:30.380 --> 53:32.460
I got me one of 'em.

53:32.550 --> 53:33.800
So?

53:33.880 --> 53:36.130
I think maybe they're pulling out.

53:39.470 --> 53:41.850
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

53:41.930 --> 53:43.470
You wanna be the one to do it?

53:49.350 --> 53:51.940
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

54:15.050 --> 54:16.510
Down!

54:25.180 --> 54:27.270
Stay low.

54:53.830 --> 54:55.920
Go! Go!

54:56.130 --> 54:58.210
Go! Go!

55:39.050 --> 55:41.130
What do we do now?

55:41.220 --> 55:45.390
We wait right here. Maybe
they'll send us up some reinforcements.

55:45.470 --> 55:46.930
To do what?

55:47.010 --> 55:50.060
To capture some of these
fucking positions around here!

55:50.140 --> 55:55.600
- You mean you really wanna go on with this?
- Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

55:55.690 --> 55:59.360
If they send us reinforcements,
maybe we could scout around

55:59.440 --> 56:01.530
and locate these machine guns.

56:01.610 --> 56:05.610
- Anyway, it's better than going back down.
- Something's coming!

56:05.700 --> 56:07.620
They're coming!

56:13.120 --> 56:14.370
What are they doin'?

56:14.460 --> 56:17.540
If they want to throw us out,
why didn't they come in force?

56:17.630 --> 56:19.840
Maybe they was acting on their own.

56:21.340 --> 56:23.840
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.220
They're coming.

56:37.270 --> 56:38.440
Keck!

56:38.520 --> 56:39.940
Jesus!

56:40.020 --> 56:42.110
Oh, Jesus!

56:43.740 --> 56:45.360
I blew my butt off!

56:45.450 --> 56:48.870
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

56:48.950 --> 56:50.410
Lay down!

56:50.490 --> 56:53.250
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

56:53.330 --> 56:56.330
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I grabbed it by the pin!

56:57.040 --> 57:01.460
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

57:01.550 --> 57:03.880
Nobody's gonna have to write her.
You'll make it.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.840
- Don't bullshit me!
- Stay down!

57:05.930 --> 57:08.010
Hey, hey.

57:09.090 --> 57:10.890
Have I got mud on my face?

57:10.970 --> 57:13.060
Wipe it off. Get it off.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.640
No!

57:16.730 --> 57:18.810
I'll write her. I promise.

57:22.230 --> 57:26.240
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

57:31.030 --> 57:33.120
It's for the best.

57:33.990 --> 57:36.290
I'm all messed up down there.

57:37.460 --> 57:39.540
I can't fuck no more.

57:41.920 --> 57:45.300
Whoa... Where am I?

57:46.760 --> 57:48.430
Where am I?

57:51.260 --> 57:53.560
You're gonna be all right.

57:53.640 --> 57:57.770
Even if you die,
you didn't let your brother down.

57:57.850 --> 58:02.560
If you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

58:02.650 --> 58:04.730
I'm cold.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.320
I'm cold.

58:10.570 --> 58:12.660
I'm... freezing.

59:08.050 --> 59:10.130
You gonna write his wife?

59:11.550 --> 59:13.430
Fuck, no.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.930
I don't know his old lady.

59:16.510 --> 59:21.060
That's the company commander's job. You
outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

59:21.140 --> 59:23.230
You told him you would.

59:23.310 --> 59:27.110
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.820
Somebody ought to do it.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.780
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

59:42.040 --> 59:44.330
What's wrong, Jim?

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:09.420
There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.510
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:17.840
- Would it keep him quiet?
- Not for long, but I can give him two.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.350
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.730
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.290
That's what you are.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.130
That's all there is for us.
That's us, that's us.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.960
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.130
All twelve of 'em.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.680
It's insanity up there.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.850
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em
where to go and I gave 'em a push.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:09.270
- Somebody help!
- I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:14.070
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here,
but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.190
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.410
I'm outta here. All right, move feet.
Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.240
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:28.000
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.080
All right. All right.

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.130
All right. All right.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.270
Somebody help me!

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.610
Help me!

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.490
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:01.990
- OK. Calm down.
- Fuck you!

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.160
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.660
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.500
- How you gonna get me out?
- I'm gonna take you back.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.590
- Come on.
- No!

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:19.260
Put me down! Put me down!

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.600
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.060
Please, leave me alone.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.570
Give me more. Give me more.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.450
Give me more. Give me more.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.700
Give me more. Give me more.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:50.080
Here, Tella.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.470
Goodbye... goodbye.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.430
Bye, kid.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.510
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.740
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company
doesn't depend on one man.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.710
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:42.050
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow
and recommend you for the Silver Star.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.760
- It's the most courageous thing...
- Captain,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.050
you say one more word to thank me,
I'll knock you right in the teeth.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.850
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign so fast

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:56.980
and leave you here
to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.320
You understand?

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.780
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:24.010
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those
men should be reinforced immediately!

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:26.930
What are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.090
They're lying behind that ledge!

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.720
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.730
I don't think you understand
what's going on, sir.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.690
We've had... heavy casualties.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:43.650
We had a man... His gut got shot out
on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.900
Fine, fine. Now,
what about those reinforcements? Over.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.530
I have... two squads to...

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.830
First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:55.330
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:58.870
Goddamn you, Staros!
When I say reinforcements,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.710
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit
everybody you have there and do it now!

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em
lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.930
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to
attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.810
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:19.140
Have 'em press the centre.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:20.900
Attack them right now!

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.780
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you
a lesson on infantry tactics

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.490
while your men
are getting their asses shot off?.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:31.320
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand
what is going on here.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.620
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.210
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much fire power.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.370
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.840
We can't see it, and it's...
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:50.590
I request permission
for patrol reconnaissance around

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.300
to the right of Hill 210.
I believe the entire position, sir,

01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:57.020
can be outflanked
with a manoeuvre there in force.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.390
- No! Goddamn it, no!
- Might save lives!

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.350
There'll be no flanking move.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.270
Listen, Staros.
You're not gonna take your men

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.820
around into the jungle
to avoid a goddamn fight!

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.450
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack
right now with every man at your disposal!

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.410
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:28.760
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:47.190
- There it is, right there. See it?
- I don't see it.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.740
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.740
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.710
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:09.800
I have two witnesses here. I request that
you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:18.510
Staros, don't pull this
guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.729
Now, l know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.060
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:30.029
Now, I want that frontal attack.
I repeat my order. Over.

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:33.779
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there
in a frontal attack.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.029
It's suicide, sir.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:41.290
I've lived with these men for two years, and
I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.880
This is a very important decision, Staros.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:09:00.310
But if you feel that strongly, maybe
you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.770
Go take a look.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:05.560
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.479
but if I find extenuating circumstances
when I get there, I'll take that into account.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:14.859
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there.

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:19.160
And, if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.010
One spot's as good as another, men.

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.180
There's no place to hide.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.180
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:49.649
Where's... where's Fife?

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:51.939
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.650
Hold my hand, Fife.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.650
Hold my hand.

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:04.830
I got it.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.920
I'm dying, Fife.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.110
Oh, Captain...

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.500
Shut up in a tomb.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.750
Can't lift the lid.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.300
Played a role l never conceived.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.590
Get that blouse on, soldier.
It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.350
Put it on right now.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:49.810
What you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.980
Move up!

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.490
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.370
Observing, sir. Just sent
First Platoon forward to the ridge.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:18.090
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:20.260
None? Not one?

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:25.220
Doesn't sound like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.890
Well, it's not. The situation's changed
just in the last five minutes, sir.

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:35.520
Captain, you listen to me.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.230
We're going over there
and taking everybody with us.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.820
Do you have any more complaints
or demurrers?

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.570
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right! We're gonna do things my way!

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.070
My way! You understand that, Captain?

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.450
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.420
I think the ridge
is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:06.090
Show me how to see things the way you do.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.640
Show me how to see things the way you do.

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.100
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.210
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.550
Bell, take six men

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.720
and go see what's up there.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:58.140
And we'll cover you the best we can
from down there.

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:19.350
OK.

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:21.940
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.150
I'm going alone.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.830
Come out.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:14.260
Come out where lam.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.500
There was a... There was a...

01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:29.500
There's a bunker... up there.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.420
It's five guns.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:36.050
It's five guns.

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:45.350
That strongpoint up there,
somewhere up there around those rocks,

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.520
is the key to this ridge.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.730
Bell here is quite right.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:58.530
From their knob up there, those little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the ground

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.950
in front of this position for 1,000 yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.990
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.250
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:17.130
All right, all right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted,

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.680
and we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:24.470
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.270
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.440
So I'm asking for volunteers.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.780
Go back up there and knock it out.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.940
Sir?

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:42.110
I'll be glad to go back up

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.530
- and lead the way back for a party.
- Right.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.330
- I'll go, sir.
- You.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.540
All right.

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:53.460
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.460
- You'll be in command.
- I'll go, sir.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.920
- Sir?
- You.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.010
All right, men, that's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.310
I don't know if you realise the importance
of this operation, Staros.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.900
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:18.940
That means air power
for 1,000 miles in every direction.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.690
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:27.400
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:33.530
I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.830
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:39.000
I can't say, sir.

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:50.130
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:53.010
How many? One? Two?

01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:57.050
Twenty?

01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:01.600
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:07.360
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:12.150
No, sir. You're right...
about everything you said.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.320
Fine, fine.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.490
That's all, Captain.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.290
One more thing, Staros.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.330
It's not necessary for you
to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.580
Ever.

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:30.000
We'll assume it.

01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:31.960
Dismissed.

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.860
I feel sorry for you, kid.

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:54.320
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.870
This army's gonna kill you.

01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:09.330
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.590
You're just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:31.270
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.240
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:48.040
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be OK.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.210
There's just this one.

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:54.210
Just this rock.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:33.670
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:36.880
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.670
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.640
This is futile!

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:50.190
Look at me!
I stand right up here and not one bullet.

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.350
Not one shot!

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:55.150
Why?

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.530
How come they all had to die?

01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:02.070
I can stand right here, I can stand right up
and nothing happens to me!

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.680
We.

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.310
We together.

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:46.120
One being.

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.430
Flow together like water,

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.010
till I can't tell you from me.

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:28.990
I drink you.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.120
Now.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.540
Now.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.250
You're my light.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.590
My guide.

01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:34.120
John, I'll be behind you.
If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.750
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.000
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.410
OK.

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:40.080
Stay down, below this ledge,

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.160
and I'll call down the data from above.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:48.840
Once the 81s have plastered that rock...
as much as possible,

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.710
we're gonna crawl out
along that big rock for cover

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.300
and then flank 'em to the right.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.260
OK?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.350
OK. OK.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.620
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.840
100 left, add 200.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.590
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:36.720
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.010
Left 100, add 200.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.970
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.810
Understand. 1470 from EasyRoger 7.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.280
Left 25, drop 50!

01:31:04.450 --> 01:31:06.540
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.920
Left 25, drop 50.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.080
Fire for effect. Over.

01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:13.420
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:37.440
Let's go!

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.300
OK, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:32:00.630
Nobody fire or throw the grenades
till I give the signal.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.800
OK, let's do it.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.400
Is he OK? ls he all right?

01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:22.860
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:26.990
- No, we can't leave him here.
- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.080
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back,... if he's still alive.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.380
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.050
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:06.870
Behind you!

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.380
We're pinned down!

01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:56.420
Fall back!

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.840
Go!

01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:16.040
Watch out.

01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:56.120
Clear!

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:50.420
Come on. Get out.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.880
Go on.

01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:58.970
Think you're soldiers?

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:08.230
You piece of shit!

01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:16.370
Son of a bitch!

01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:18.530
Son of a bitch!

01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.640
All right?

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:44.480
I shot a man.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.810
Stinks around here.

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.560
- All these dead people.
- Put a cigarette up your nose.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.150
Look at 'em move!

01:39:51.230 --> 01:39:52.980
Look at 'em move!

01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:54.940
We got 'em on the run!

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:58.240
Way to go, John. When they saw you
make that attack and win,

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.860
you put their hearts back into them.

01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:03.160
- Hey, hey!
- Don't do that, soldier.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.080
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.620
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:13.460
Sir, I've a few recommendations
for decorations.

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.090
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em
that we can, but later.

01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:21.630
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.180
Perhaps the big one.

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.350
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...
- Yes, you do, John.

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.270
Getting it for you
will be the goddamn problem!

01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:33.770
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion
and the regiment, if you did get it.

01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:35.520
We better move out.

01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:40.150
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.200
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company?

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.320
Of course.

01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:49.040
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but about the water. If we don't get water...

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.210
Don't worry about water.

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:57.960
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours now we have the momentum.

01:40:58.050 --> 01:41:01.590
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:03.760
I've arranged for that.

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:07.890
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,
and wait for it.

01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:09.850
No, sir.

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.140
That's right.

01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:18.020
And if some of the men... pass out,
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.700
All right.

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.240
They could...

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.660
- They could die from it.
- They could die from enemy fire, too!

01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:32.290
They're all tough boys.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:42.170
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see
plenty more of those where we're going!

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:44.840
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.680
John, I'm convinced that
the Japanese position can be broken now.

01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:57.860
All we have to do is keep going and we'll
have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.940
You see the spirit in these men?
D'you see the new spirit?

01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:06.200
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.160
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:12.910
or even to have it reinforced
from troops from the reserves,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.170
if we were to stall
before reaching the top, well,

01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:20.500
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:22.960
I've waited all my life for this.

01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:27.590
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.140
And I don't intend to give it up now.

01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:36.980
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:40.230
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the Academy.

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:45.990
You're, you know, you've got your war!
This 15 years, this is my first war!

01:42:51.450 --> 01:42:54.790
John, some day you'll understand.

01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:02.750
You're like a son to me, John.

01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:07.220
You know what my son does?

01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:10.220
He's a bait salesman.

01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:14.890
You've done a hell of a job, John.

01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:19.850
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything,
everything that you deserve.

01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.190
Thank you, sir.

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:28.360
God...

01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:31.910
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:33.660
Get me three runners!

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.990
You go back to the rear to find water

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.960
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:43.090
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:45.670
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:47.840
It's high ground by nightfall!

01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:14.530
You seen many dead people?

01:44:15.330 --> 01:44:17.290
Plenty.

01:44:17.370 --> 01:44:20.000
They're no different than dead dogs,

01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:22.790
once you get used to the idea.

01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:29.720
They're meat, kid.

01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:48.730
Are you righteous? Kind?

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:53.990
Does your confidence lie in this?

01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:59.500
Are you loved by all?

01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:03.870
Know that l was, too.

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:12.130
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less
because you loved goodness?

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.840
Truth?

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:16.420
Get fucking on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

01:49:17.170 --> 01:49:19.250
Get down. Stay there.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.600
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.560
Now!

01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:35.370
This great evil.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.210
Where's it come from?

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.970
How'd it steal into the world?

01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:02.270
What seed, what root did it grow from?

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.280
Who's doing this?

01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:13.950
Who's killing us?

01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:20.420
Robbing us of life and light.

01:51:25.170 --> 01:51:28.590
Mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known.

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.290
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:03.290
Does it help the grass to grow
or the sun to shine?

01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:11.760
Is this darkness in you, too?

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.560
Have you passed through this night?

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.320
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:35.120
You're dying.

01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:49.170
See them birds up there?

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.220
You know they eat you raw?

01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.310
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.880
What are you to me?

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.770
Nothing.

01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:46.080
Have a seat here.

01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:59.130
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:04.890
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.680
I already told him.

01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:21.360
It's a hard thing to do.

01:57:22.150 --> 01:57:24.240
Difficult decision to make.

01:57:27.370 --> 01:57:29.540
I don't think you're tough enough.

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:36.040
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted.
You're not tough-fibred enough.

01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:44.550
Anyway, it's my decision to make.
I've already made it.

01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.760
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:59.230
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:01.610
Have you?

01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:17.210
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:22.710
I don't want it in the records of the battalion.
There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.380
This has nothing to do with
cowardice or inefficiency.

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.970
Look at this jungle.

01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:37.400
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:42.110
Nature's cruel, Staros.

01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:56.910
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment
to the Judge Advocate General Corps

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.880
for reasons of ill health.

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.340
You're a lawyer.

01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:02.800
- You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.

01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.260
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:07.590
Anyway, you probably will have it.

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:11.350
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star.

01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:15.600
And I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:19.150
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:23.480
Why?

01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:29.200
Because of that scratch on your face
and because of those cuts on your hands.

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.950
Listen to me, Staros.

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:35.080
I think it's best you go back with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:38.960
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:42.590
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

02:00:17.250 --> 02:00:19.500
This is from Colonel Tall.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.500
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride".

02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:29.130
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal".

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:35.470
"Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:40.810
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:46.520
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line".

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:52.240
That's all.

02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:49.770
Hours like months.

02:02:52.530 --> 02:02:54.610
Days like years.

02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:00.030
Walked into the golden age.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.580
Stood on the shores of the New World.

02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:20.470
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit,

02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:22.220
but...

02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:27.980
I just felt like being alone, you know?

02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:31.860
Yeah?

02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:44.120
We wanted to thank you, sir.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.670
For asking to make that flanking move.

02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:54.840
For watching out for us.

02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.970
Keeping us together.

02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:06.220
We're all sorry to see you go.

02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:08.480
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:13.900
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:18.530
Tough part is...

02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:22.910
not knowing if you're doing any good.

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:26.870
That's the hard part.

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:31.250
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.170
I'm glad to be going.

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.380
I'm glad.

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.260
- There's still time. We could file a complaint.
- For what?

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.600
What good would that do?

02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:47.970
Anyway, I wanna go.

02:04:50.890 --> 02:04:53.350
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:08.040
What does that mean, sir?

02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:13.080
It means "You've been like my sons".

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:26.430
You are my sons.

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:29.770
My dear sons.

02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:35.770
You live inside me now.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:41.860
I'll carry you wherever I go.

02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.670
Can't nothing make you forget it.

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.890
Each time you start from scratch.

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:15.310
War don't ennoble men.

02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:18.650
It turns 'em into dogs.

02:06:24.450 --> 02:06:26.530
Poisons the soul.

02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:32.600
My dear wife,

02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:41.940
you get something twisted out of your
insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:54.030
I wanna stay changeless for you.

02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:59.620
I wanna come back to you
the man I was before.

02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:10.340
How do we get to those other shores?

02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:16.270
To those blue hills.

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.150
Love.

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:39.790
Where does it come from?

02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.340
Who lit this flame in us?

02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:59.480
No war can put it out,

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:03.060
conquer it.

02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.990
I was a prisoner.

02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:19.540
You set me free.

02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:26.210
No matter how much training you got,

02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:29.420
how careful you are,

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:34.260
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:39.600
Makes no difference who you are,
or how tough a guy you might be,

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.060
if you're in the wrong spot
at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.240
I look at that boy dying,

02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.830
I don't feel nothing.

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.750
I don't care about nothing any more.

02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:15.510
Sounds like bliss.

02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:22.060
I don't have that feeling yet.

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:25.560
That numbness.

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:28.690
Not like the rest of you guys.

02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:35.320
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:40.780
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:28.080
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

02:11:29.170 --> 02:11:31.250
Or talked to one.

02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:37.340
I don't wanna...

02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:40.590
I don't wanna feel the desire.

02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:19.380
All right. Abrahams!

02:12:19.470 --> 02:12:21.140
Abrahams. Here you go.

02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.100
Stack! Where's Stack?

02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:25.220
Bring him out.

02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:27.390
Bell?

02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:29.350
Bell!

02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:32.900
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

02:12:35.650 --> 02:12:37.730
Dear Jack,

02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:44.700
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.

02:12:47.410 --> 02:12:49.710
I want a divorce to marry him.

02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:59.630
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway,

02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:02.510
out of the memory of what we had together.

02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:11.350
Forgive me.

02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:14.900
It just got too lonely, Jack.

02:13:35.210 --> 02:13:37.290
We'll meet again some day.

02:13:41.090 --> 02:13:45.050
People who have been as close as we've been
always meet again.

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.360
I have no right to speak to you this way.

02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.730
I can't stop myself.

02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:01.320
A habit so strong.

02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:06.110
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:12.330
Help me leave you!

02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:41.710
What's your name?

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.830
We were a family.

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:01.670
How'd it break up and come apart?

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:08.420
So that now we're turned against each other.

02:17:10.299 --> 02:17:12.879
Each standing in the other's light.

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:24.730
How did we lose the good that was given us?

02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:28.610
Let it slip away?

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.490
Scatter it careless?

02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:56.600
What's keeping us from reaching out?

02:17:57.219 --> 02:17:59.309
Touching the glory?

02:18:01.350 --> 02:18:05.100
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,

02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:07.270
Long ago.

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:10.940
They leave you here?

02:18:12.490 --> 02:18:13.990
Yup.

02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:16.160
I slowed 'em up.

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.740
Don't mind, really.

02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:22.540
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:24.750
I got plenty of ammo.

02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:30.049
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

02:18:35.129 --> 02:18:37.430
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.

02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:39.219
Yeah.

02:18:39.299 --> 02:18:41.889
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:50.770
- What you doin' down here?
- Just, you know,

02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:53.150
I'm heading back to the company.

02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:55.490
Yeah.

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.620
Well, you give all them boys my best.

02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:01.160
You can come with me if you want.

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:03.370
I'll help you along.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.580
No, it's nice and quiet.

02:19:07.670 --> 02:19:09.750
Peaceful up here.

02:19:12.129 --> 02:19:15.299
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:21.260
I'll remind 'em.

02:19:21.719 --> 02:19:23.809
OK.

02:20:59.030 --> 02:21:01.110
Hey, Witt.

02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:07.830
Who you making trouble for today?

02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:10.960
What d'you mean?

02:21:11.710 --> 02:21:14.880
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.630
Turn left when they say go right?

02:21:24.470 --> 02:21:26.970
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

02:21:29.390 --> 02:21:31.940
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:35.400
I always felt like you did.

02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:39.940
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:43.610
One day I can come up and talk to you,

02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:48.540
by the next day it's like we never even met.

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.970
Lonely house now.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:09.720
You ever get lonely?

02:22:09.810 --> 02:22:11.890
Only around people.

02:22:13.810 --> 02:22:15.900
Only around people.

02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:23.950
You still believing in the beautiful light,
are you?

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.620
How do you do that?

02:22:35.290 --> 02:22:37.380
You're a magician to me.

02:22:46.430 --> 02:22:48.510
I still see a spark in you.

02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:19.330
One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

02:23:22.050 --> 02:23:24.130
But death's got the final word.

02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:29.300
It's laughing at him.

02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:41.110
Another man sees that same bird,

02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:46.110
feels the glory.

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.660
Feels something smiling through him.

02:24:51.010 --> 02:24:53.470
We need to get out of here right now.

02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:58.140
- You explain to... headquarters the situation?
- No.

02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:02.310
Do they know where we are?
Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:07.030
Well, I think that's...
up to me to judge, Sergeant.

02:25:08.650 --> 02:25:14.240
I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are. OK?

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:16.200
It's easy.

02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:19.660
Hey, Weld...
get headquarters on that thing.

02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:21.660
The fire's coming closer, sir.

02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:22.790
Line's cut!

02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:29.960
We need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut.

02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:32.680
And we need to find out how close they are.

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:34.300
Come on.

02:25:34.390 --> 02:25:36.930
OK. OK.

02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:43.140
Hey, you.

02:25:43.770 --> 02:25:45.020
You go.

02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:47.690
You're going, Fife.

02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:56.320
Coombs. You go, too.

02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:58.080
Come on!

02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.710
I'll go. I want you to know
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:07.840
If they come down here in any strength,
Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:10.380
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:15.590
No, I wanna go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I wanna be there.

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.180
All right. You stay by the river.

02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:21.180
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:23.350
I will.

02:26:23.430 --> 02:26:25.400
Good luck, Witt.

02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:27.610
You OK, Fife?

02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:57.400
A reinforce battalion.

02:27:58.990 --> 02:28:00.660
We need to go back.

02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:02.620
Tell the lieutenant.

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:08.290
Let's go.

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.640
I'm hit!

02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:29.370
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.590
We'll be all right.

02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:46.600
My friend here doesn't have long,

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:49.600
so... you go.

02:29:50.810 --> 02:29:52.270
You go on ahead.

02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:17.590
Witt!

02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:05.510
They're coming.

02:31:06.970 --> 02:31:10.300
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:15.230
Just hide out here till you hear firing,
then push on down the river.

02:31:15.310 --> 02:31:16.770
No.

02:31:57.020 --> 02:32:00.690
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back, they're coming.

02:32:01.650 --> 02:32:03.730
Fall back.

02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:07.780
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:16.080
Fife, where's Witt?

02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:22.790
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:08.020
America.

02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:59.320
Where's your spark now?

02:37:22.090 --> 02:37:26.180
Now, I know you men have been
making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:27.510
That's OK by me.

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.310
Everything a lie.

02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:33.060
Any man in my outfit
can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:35.270
Everything you hear and see.

02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:39.530
As long as he's in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment given.

02:37:39.610 --> 02:37:43.490
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

02:37:43.570 --> 02:37:47.410
- So much to spew out.
- I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

02:37:47.490 --> 02:37:50.700
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:52.870
We are a family.

02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:56.130
I'm the father.

02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:59.880
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:02.680
They just keep coming, one after another.

02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:06.050
That makes you all the children in this family.

02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:09.680
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:14.440
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:18.230
- If any of you wanna see me about anything,
- You're in a box.

02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.440
- anything at all,
- A moving box.

02:38:20.530 --> 02:38:22.610
you will find that I am available.

02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:25.660
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:28.700
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home...

02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:30.870
They want you dead.

02:38:33.250 --> 02:38:35.330
Or in their lie.

02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:42.630
Only one thing a man can do.

02:38:45.630 --> 02:38:47.720
Find something that's his.

02:38:50.970 --> 02:38:53.060
Make an island for himself.

02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:09.030
If I never meet you in this life,

02:39:10.450 --> 02:39:12.540
Let me feel the lack.

02:39:21.090 --> 02:39:25.510
A glance from your eyes,
and my life will be yours.

02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:18.690
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.

02:40:18.850 --> 02:40:23.440
I mean, I don't know what, you know,
what your plans are, but...

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:27.530
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.

02:40:27.610 --> 02:40:30.950
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:33.910
I'm ready to start living it good.

02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:38.960
You know, my daddy always told me it's
gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:43.590
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be
that hard when you're young.

02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:47.340
Well, I figure after this
the worst is gonna be gone.

02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:51.640
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:54.720
That's what's gonna happen.

02:40:55.850 --> 02:40:57.930
I'm getting older now.

02:40:58.770 --> 02:41:01.270
By no means old, but older.

02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:05.230
Where is it that we were together?

02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:10.700
Who were you that I lived with?

02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:17.490
Walked with?

02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:26.710
The brother.

02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:35.300
The friend.

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:03.710
Darkness from light.

02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:07.290
Strife from love.

02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:11.590
Are they the workings of one mind?

02:42:12.970 --> 02:42:15.720
The features of the same face?

02:42:30.610 --> 02:42:32.690
Oh, my soul,

02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:36.410
Let me be in you now.

02:42:42.450 --> 02:42:44.750
Look out through my eyes.

02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:48.540
Look out at the things you made.

02:42:53.470 --> 02:42:55.760
All things shining.
