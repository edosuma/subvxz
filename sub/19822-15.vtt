It may as well be me.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.017
I'll go. Searching for a diamond

00:18.085 --> 00:20.419
in a scary maze of tunnels
is an adult's job.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.121
You're just an almost adult

00:22.189 --> 00:23.756
and you're not even that
much older than me.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.025
Besides, you need to stay here

00:26.093 --> 00:27.026
Let me come with you.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.027
I'm sorry, Anika.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.728
I can help! What if there's

Yeah, no, yeah, same.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.874
Actually I could use you.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.553

strawberries

00:58.959 --> 01:00.726
I hate strawberries. I love bananas.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.162
Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.337

Okay, okay, hey, I'm not afraid, okay?

01:14.075 --> 01:15.374
I'm just a little... Phobic?

01:15.443 --> 01:17.009
Yes. What does phobic mean?

Afraid.

dot is Tess, right?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.223
Yep, it's a signal.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.491
That's so we can trace her.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.126
But how does she know where to go?

02:07.194 --> 02:08.526
We'll guide her.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.362
Cool.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.733
If it all goes according to plan,

02:14.802 --> 02:17.769
it'll lead her right
to the Red Diamond.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.607

something from me, would you?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.025

03:13.093 --> 03:15.294

you're not telling me something.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.657
so I decided to come this way instead.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.093

on something and ripped.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.777
Uh, that didn't rip. That was cut.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.790
No, that's just an urban legend.

(Gertrude) Who would have
thought old Cassandra

12:17.003 --> 12:20.071
would stash the diamond underground?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.840
But why didn't she just put it

12:21.908 --> 12:23.408
in a safe or something?

12:23.477 --> 12:24.909
Why go through all the trouble

12:24.978 --> 12:27.045
of building an underground maze?

12:27.114 --> 12:31.182
Oh, the tunnel complex
was there all along.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.551
The smugglers and secret traders

12:33.620 --> 12:35.253
have used it throughout history.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.421
Smuggling tunnels?

12:36.490 --> 12:40.125
Cassandra was in love
with your ancestor,

12:40.193 --> 12:41.760
Kees Hunter.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.828
She was very jealous of his wife,

12:43.897 --> 12:46.331
her younger sister, Josephine.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.133
She was the one who Jan Saganash

12:48.201 --> 12:50.001
gave the Red Diamond to, right?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.770
According to the story,

12:51.838 --> 12:54.139
Cassandra stole the Red
Diamond and hid it

12:54.207 --> 12:56.474
because her sister was loved by two men

12:56.543 --> 12:57.842
and she had no one.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.779
But I thought Jan

13:00.847 --> 13:03.314
took the diamond with him to Indonesia.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.684
Perhaps, perhaps not.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.989
Either way, jealousy
is a terrible disease.

13:11.057 --> 13:15.627

places in your soul.
