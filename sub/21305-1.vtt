01:19.520 --> 01:20.950
Stop!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.030
Police! Stop!

01:24.080 --> 01:25.590
Can I Taser her?
No!

01:25.640 --> 01:27.600
Let me Taser her!
No!

01:29.040 --> 01:31.480
Stop! Stop!

01:33.680 --> 01:35.120
Oh, thank God for that!

01:36.600 --> 01:38.550
One move and you're down!
No, no, please don't!

01:38.600 --> 01:40.350
How many times, Davina?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.870
How many times do I have to
tell you I hate giving chase?

01:42.920 --> 01:44.910
Bloody hell, look at the state of me!

01:44.960 --> 01:46.710
I'm knackered, I'm sweat-dripping!

01:46.760 --> 01:49.270
I'm going to be uncomfortable
for the whole bloody day now!

01:49.320 --> 01:52.510
Please! Look, I'm asking you, right,

01:52.560 --> 01:54.150
woman to woman, yeah?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.400
Just one more chance, please? Please?

01:58.200 --> 02:01.110
You know, Davina,
the drug dealing, I can handle.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.590
The lies.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.990
God, even using your own
children to deliver the gear,

02:06.040 --> 02:08.400
it's all just what I've come to expect.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.030
You know the thing that
really pisses me off

02:14.080 --> 02:16.310
is that despite all
these ill-earned gains,

02:16.360 --> 02:18.800
you are still, still claiming benefits.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.950
Which means mugs like me
are paying for the privilege

02:23.000 --> 02:25.430
of chasing you around
the bleeding streets.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.800
Oh!

02:29.240 --> 02:31.230
Leave her! Leave her! Leave her!

02:31.280 --> 02:33.910
Leave her! Just come back!

02:36.800 --> 02:40.270
No, no, no! Get the car!
Get the car now!

02:40.320 --> 02:42.670
Oh, shit!

02:45.600 --> 02:47.630
God, is this the fastest you can go?

02:47.680 --> 02:48.950
Oh, God!

02:49.000 --> 02:52.230
It's only a punch. Why is it...?
I'm pregnant, OK?

02:52.280 --> 02:55.190
And you, you tell no-one, Mickey.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.120
I haven't even told Paul yet.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.640
Is it OK?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.710
Is it all right?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.720
Heartbeat. He's fine.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.000
Or she.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.710
Let me check around a bit,

03:21.760 --> 03:24.440
but I think everything
looks perfectly normal.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.680
Helen.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.950
I didn't know who else to call.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.360
Is everything OK?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.350
Yeah, it's fine.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.920
It's fine.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.739
But I reckon my days on the
street are over for a while.

03:48.839 --> 03:49.430
Yeah.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.590
'Police in Polesford are
continuing their search...

03:52.640 --> 03:54.150
Oh, God, have you seen this?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.710
.. for schoolgirls Poppy
Johnston and Abigail Toms.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.950
Abigail went missing three weeks ago

03:59.000 --> 04:02.230
and Poppy was last seen
getting into a car yesterday.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.390
Dave Guest is there for us this evening.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.357
So weird to see Polesford
all over the news.

04:06.557 --> 04:07.270
It's awful.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.959
I spoke to Dad.
He said the place is crawling with press.

04:10.059 --> 04:10.630
Yeah?

04:10.680 --> 04:14.630
The police have mounted an intensive
search of open ground in this area,

04:14.680 --> 04:17.790
although their efforts are being
hampered by extensive flooding.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.190
It's been raining intensively
here for over three weeks.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.990
So tonight,
with two girls still missing,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.030
the tension here is palpable.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.960
This is a community in shock.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.560
Paul?
In the bathroom.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.470
I need to talk to you.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.870
Well, I won't be a sec.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.520
I'm pregnant.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.760
Are you serious?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.480
Oh, Helen!

05:16.960 --> 05:19.430
Hey! Have you washed your hands?

05:19.480 --> 05:20.950
No.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.800
Can I have another kiss?

05:24.540 --> 05:26.110
'Police are continuing their search...

05:26.160 --> 05:27.990
So, I know we're not out the woods yet,

05:28.040 --> 05:30.110
but can I... can I tell my mum?

05:30.160 --> 05:33.190
She'll be, like... Well, it'll make
her year. It'll make her decade.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.230
.. last seen getting
into a car yesterday.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.910
God, this is what we've
got to look forward to.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.030
20 years of fear.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.990
Come on,
you know how rare this stuff is.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.470
I've dealt with child killers,
it's always someone known to 'em.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.950
Mm. Better keep an eye on your Ian,
then.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.590
Shall I open this?

05:55.640 --> 05:58.550
Erm... wine? Really?

05:58.600 --> 06:02.510
One glass. Everyone knows that's OK.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.350
'.. Even more difficult
because of torrential rain

06:05.400 --> 06:07.310
and extensive flooding in the area.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.390
Oh, God! What have I done?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.830
I'm a copper!

06:12.880 --> 06:15.950
I can't see myself sitting in
cafes with my tits out all day.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.710
Helen, it'll be great!

06:17.760 --> 06:19.190
Look, I'll take some time off.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.950
We'll just hang out, the three of us.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.030
Come on. I mean, you can't say
things have been easy lately, yeah?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.750
We've hardly seen each other.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.670
That's why coppers get together,
isn't it?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.510
So they don't have to.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.950
'Is there any more news on

06:34.000 --> 06:35.830
the man they've brought
in for questioning?

06:35.880 --> 06:38.110
Sources close to the
enquiry have told us

06:38.160 --> 06:41.430
that that man is Stephen Bates,
a resident of Polesford.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.310
37-year-old Bates...

06:43.360 --> 06:45.280
Shit!
What?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.230
The suspect's wife, I know her.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.320
Linda Jackson,
that's what she used to be called.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.950
She was my best friend.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.590
.. The man currently in custody.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.390
However, he stated the investigation
has taken a stride forward,

07:00.440 --> 07:01.720
and has...

07:36.560 --> 07:38.590
Helen,
there's an investigation team in place.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.270
They won't want you barging in there.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.350
But I've got specialist
knowledge of the area,

07:42.400 --> 07:45.430
and the suspect's wife
is a childhood friend.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.600
I'm sorry, I can't allow it.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.400
OK.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.150
Well, um, there is another issue.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.790
Um...

07:59.960 --> 08:02.200
Pregnant.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.750
I haven't been feeling
very well recently,

08:05.800 --> 08:08.790
so I'd like to request a week's leave,
starting today.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.640
Well, congratulations.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.630
I'm... I'm going to have to
go to Polesford, obviously,

08:16.680 --> 08:18.480
tell my father the good news.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.470
All right, I'll get them to
endorse access to Linda Bates,

08:23.520 --> 08:25.550
but no stepping on anyone's toes.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.320
Understand?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.309
Helen?

08:32.360 --> 08:33.960
Yeah, I understand.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.771
What are you doing?

08:44.971 --> 08:46.630
I'm coming with you.
No.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.710
Helen, you're pregnant, you've got
hormones raging around your body.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.910
Oh,
which makes that a very brave sentence.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.240
Seriously, Paul, I don't...
I don't need you there.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.230
The whole time I've known you,
it's been, "I hate the place.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.990
"Reminds me of my mum dying."

09:01.040 --> 09:03.070
And then, all of a sudden,
you want to go back.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.550
Yeah, well, she was my best friend.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.590
When's the last time you saw her?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.190
I've never even heard you mention her.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.950
I need to help her.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.320
Fine.
Then you can see it as a mini-break.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.870
What, at my dad's, during a manhunt?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.520
You've got a funny idea of a holiday.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.040
You OK?

10:18.120 --> 10:20.590
Shall we go straight to your dad's?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.880
No, let's... Let's go see where
they moved Linda to first.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.110
Detectives Weeks and Hopkins.
I've got authorisation.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.750
I'm Helen Weeks,
an old friend of Linda Jackson.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.870
I mean, Bates.
DC Sophie Carson.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.520
And this is Detective Hopkins.
Just you.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.480
Oh, fine. I'll...
I'll go for a walk, take in the sights.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.960
I'll let her know you're here.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.470
Linda, you've got a visitor.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.240
Helen Weeks.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.320
Oh...

11:32.560 --> 11:34.040
Hello.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.070
He didn't take them girls, you know.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.830
They get it wrong... don't they?

11:44.880 --> 11:48.200
Sometimes, they make mistakes.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.080
You stopped returning Christmas cards.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.080
Sorry.

12:03.880 --> 12:07.720
My career,
it sort of becomes all-consuming.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.030
We had a school reunion last year.
Yeah?

12:15.080 --> 12:17.430
Yeah, it was a laugh,
what, with the old faces.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.200
You all right?
Hi.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.480
That's Charli.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.990
How's your sister?
Oh, she's... she's fine.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.390
She's married and she's
got a couple of kids.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.590
I just found out I'm pregnant.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.120
You left it late.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.190
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose I did.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.790
You'll love it.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.360
Will I?

12:43.840 --> 12:45.190
I don't know.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.200
How about you, you and Stephen?
How long have you been married?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.790
Five years.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.790
He's not from round here.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.480
Danny and Charli aren't his.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.270
Danny?
My youngest.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.710
He's upstairs. He refuses to come down.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.670
And, yeah, Steve's great with them.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.150
Like they're his own,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.870
seeing as it's so bloody
obvious what you're thinking.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.480
Everyone else is.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.990
Paul Hopkins, the one and only!

13:40.040 --> 13:42.470
Long time since Hendon!
Yeah. Good to see you, man.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.070
And you. I didn't realise you'd
ended up round these parts.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.910
Yeah. It's temporary.
Still, big fish in a small pond, eh?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.390
You in Manchester?
Yeah, yeah, for my sins.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.280
Oh, cool. Good.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.910
So, um... what can I do for you?

13:56.960 --> 13:59.990
Nothing, really. My girlfriend's
down visiting her father,

14:00.040 --> 14:02.110
I thought I'd come and see
how the search was going.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.070
Your girlfriend being Helen Weeks?

14:04.120 --> 14:06.470
I was the one that gave her
the nod to talk to Linda.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.470
Oh.
Truth? It's been a bloody nightmare.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.030
Flooding means we can't search
as thoroughly in a lot of places.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.190
River's moving so fast,
it's too hard for the divers.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.870
That where you think they are,
the river?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.390
It'd be the most obvious thing.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.965
It's flowing so fast,
they'd be gone like that.

14:18.065 --> 14:18.430
Mm.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.990
When it comes to getting rid of bodies,

14:20.040 --> 14:21.310
this weather is pretty useful.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.270
Bodies? They could still be alive.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.110
Two girls? One missing over three weeks?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.110
What do you think?
Mm.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.030
So, well, what's Bates saying?
He's saying he picked up Poppy

14:32.080 --> 14:34.990
when she was on her way to
a night out in Tilworth.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.870
So, I mean,
he's not denying picking her up.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.870
He can't, cos we've got witnesses.
He's denying killing her.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.590
What about the first girl?

14:41.640 --> 14:44.310
He claims he never picked her up.
We're checking his car now.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.230
Maybe we'll find something.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.670
Mate, listen, if you can get
me a strand of hair right now,

14:49.720 --> 14:51.951
I'll go straight and
charge that smug prick.

14:52.051 --> 14:52.670
Smug?

14:52.720 --> 14:54.270
Yeah, he's got one of them faces.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.590
Right, well, listen,
I'll get out your way.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.470
All right, mate, take care.
Make the most of your time, man.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.830
Go to the model village,
if it's not under a foot of water.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.510
I'll go and add a load of very
little policemen, make it realistic.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.070
See you, mate.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.640
Yeah, see you later.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.640
Hey!

15:22.760 --> 15:25.150
Hey! Come in! You're soaking.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.070
Hey, Robert, how are you doing?
Good to see you!

15:28.120 --> 15:31.390
Hey, beauty!
What's your name? Aw! Lovely!

15:31.440 --> 15:34.350
Syd, this is Paul.
You met briefly at that golfing thing.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.790
Hey, mate, good to see you again.
And you, and you. Welcome.

15:36.840 --> 15:37.559
Hi, Syd.
Long time.

15:37.759 --> 15:38.910
I thought you'd be earlier.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.590
No, I... I had to go and see Linda.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.510
This is what it takes to get
her to come home, you know?

15:43.560 --> 15:44.880
A crime scene.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.150
It's terrible, isn't it?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.870
She was her best friend,
has she told you?

15:49.920 --> 15:51.390
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.830
I'm not saying he's guilty, but, erm,

15:53.880 --> 15:57.750
he once knocked a parcel clean
out of my hand in the post office.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.830
Never apologised.
Oh, well, send him down.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.510
No, actually, there's...
Well, there's another reason.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.120
We've... we've got some news for you.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.510
Oh, my God! You're not...?

16:12.560 --> 16:14.070
Yeah.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.070
We're going to be grandads! Come here!

16:18.220 --> 16:19.390
Congratulations.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.070
And you. Well done, mate!

16:22.120 --> 16:23.430
Thanks, Robert.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.470
Hey, come on, come through.
Tea for four?

16:25.520 --> 16:28.040
Yeah.
Come on! Good boy!

16:55.880 --> 16:59.870
Oh, well! No en suite,
furniture's seen better days,

16:59.920 --> 17:01.720
and do you call that a king-size?

17:01.770 --> 17:04.589
I'll have to bad-mouth
them on TripAdvisor.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.839
You OK?
Yeah.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.750
It's just weird being back.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.349
You know, seeing Linda.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.240
This room.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.710
You know,
you tell people that you're pregnant

17:19.760 --> 17:22.589
and they're all, like, "Oh, wow!
Fantastic!

17:22.640 --> 17:25.920
"Oh, my God,
you're going to be amazing!" Huh!

17:28.960 --> 17:30.590
What if I'm not?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.710
I can't see myself in elasticated jeans,
wiping arses.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.180
What?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.840
Wait here.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.150
Now,
imagine we have one who looks like her.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.950
Oh, now, she's cute. You wouldn't
mind that face looking up at you.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.790
I'm going to remind you of that

18:06.840 --> 18:10.110
when she needs feeding at
four o'clock in the morning.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.440
You were a cute kid.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.110
I'm excited, Helen.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.120
This is a new start for us.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.120
I love you.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.400
I love you.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.950
Hey! Turn the TV on.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.480
What?

19:00.060 --> 19:02.630
'Police won't yet confirm if
the body is that of either

19:02.680 --> 19:05.270
of the missing schoolgirls,
Poppy Johnston or Abigail Toms.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.150
What they will say is that a body,

19:07.200 --> 19:09.670
believed to be that of
a young white female,

19:09.720 --> 19:11.590
has been discovered
in nearby woodland...

19:11.640 --> 19:13.350
Think of them poor parents.
It's awful.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.100
Formal identification has
not yet been completed...

19:16.760 --> 19:18.950
.. but Poppy was last seen on 6th April.
Hello?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.350
Helen, it's me.
They're taking me in for questioning.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.680
Would you come with me, please?

19:26.160 --> 19:29.080
Yeah, of course I will.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.030
It's Linda. They're taking her in
for questioning. I've got to go.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.550
.. The discovery of the body
is a gruesome development

19:36.600 --> 19:38.240
in a case which has so shocked...

19:43.040 --> 19:45.310
Linda, as you're probably aware,

19:45.360 --> 19:47.510
a body was discovered early this morning

19:47.560 --> 19:50.110
in woodlands to the west of the town.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.150
Which is it, Abby or Poppy?

19:52.200 --> 19:55.110
Well,
there's no formal identification as yet,

19:55.160 --> 19:59.120
but I can say, with certainty,
it is the body of Abigail Toms.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.280
Did you know her?

20:06.080 --> 20:09.070
I knew who she was, erm,
but I didn't know her.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.590
What about Steve?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.030
Same.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.800
She ever been in his car?

20:16.360 --> 20:18.110
Not that I know of.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.990
Right. Well, that's what he told us.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.910
Your husband said that Abigail
had never been in his car.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.350
I'm afraid to say that he
wasn't telling the truth.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.240
Forensic tests prove
beyond a doubt that she has.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.070
Well,
there must be some kind of mistake.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.760
Your husband smokes Marlboro Lights,
doesn't he?

20:40.760 --> 20:43.630
Yeah. So...?
We found a cigarette end with the body,

20:43.680 --> 20:45.230
caught in plastic.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.630
What plastic?

20:46.680 --> 20:50.030
Abigail's body was wrapped
up in plastic. In bin bags.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.360
So...?
It was a Marlboro Light.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.390
DNA results are in today.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.160
By this afternoon.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.150
I know your husband's
DNA will be all over it.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.240
No, that's not possible.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.390
You don't have to do this.
Do what?

21:08.440 --> 21:11.070
Say what you think you should...
to protect him.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.230
I'm not! Helen, can you say something?

21:13.280 --> 21:15.750
Look, I'm running this investigation,
not her.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.310
Please direct all your answers to me,
OK?

21:18.360 --> 21:22.280
All they mean is that if you can
think of anything that might help...

21:23.600 --> 21:26.390
.. right now's the time to speak up.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.760
Do you know that we took your
husband's computer from your house?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.510
Yes.
And we found some stuff on the hard drive

21:34.560 --> 21:37.270
that we deem to be quite significant.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.830
Like what?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.870
Porn?

21:40.920 --> 21:44.120
Let's just say it was age specific.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.080
Hm.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.350
All right, so he was looking at porn.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.110
Don't you, Detective?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.000
This doesn't...

22:11.720 --> 22:16.070
This is fantasy!
Right, who hasn't watched porn? Who?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.870
I know I have. What, does...
does that make me a murderer,

22:18.920 --> 22:20.470
does it, Detective?

22:20.520 --> 22:22.230
Poppy Johnston.

22:22.280 --> 22:25.910
The night she went missing,
Stephen was watching porn.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.670
He says he was at a pub in Atherstone,

22:28.720 --> 22:31.110
but computer records
show that he was at home,

22:31.160 --> 22:33.110
watching some of this stuff here.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.840
Can you explain that?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.510
Whatever happens, Linda,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.790
you still have Danny and Charli.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.200
Now, you need to think
about your lives together.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.040
Your life without Stephen.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.280
Get back!

23:08.440 --> 23:10.000
Go on, get back!

23:22.440 --> 23:24.470
See them bastards out there?

23:24.520 --> 23:27.550
20, 30 journalists,
all wanting a piece of us.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.640
This is how innocent people get treated.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.110
Have you seen the photo
they're using of him?

23:34.160 --> 23:36.840
They're painting him like a murderer!

23:41.960 --> 23:44.190
It's been a tiring day.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.150
Do you think you should have a rest?

23:46.200 --> 23:49.550
You know, I'll...
I'll run a bath, or something.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.480
I'll make you...
Offer me tea and I'll take your head off!

23:54.160 --> 23:56.230
You were no use in there.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.870
Letting him say whatever he wanted.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.240
This isn't my case.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.790
I told you, Linda,

24:04.840 --> 24:06.800
I'm here as a friend.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.720
You think I'm kidding myself
about Steve, don't you?

24:18.440 --> 24:20.590
Ignoring what's staring me in the face.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.390
I've no idea.
Yeah, well, I do, because I know him.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.510
I've lived with him. I've held him.
I've had him inside me,

24:26.560 --> 24:29.280
and that is not a man
that hurts young girls.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.040
I want to help you.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.830
Hey. You all right?

25:01.880 --> 25:04.950
Could they not have put us in an hotel?

25:05.000 --> 25:08.030
This place stinks of dogs, man.
Huh!

25:08.080 --> 25:12.560
You, erm, you and your sister want
anything? I could get you some food.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.920
Mm.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.030
Chips.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.200
Chips and rice.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.840
Chips and rice and... veg?

25:26.920 --> 25:28.400
Tomato sauce.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.720
Right, coming up.

25:52.240 --> 25:55.990
How is she?
She's doing cartwheels.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.520
Yeah, well...

25:58.600 --> 26:00.710
What, she deserves to feel like shit?

26:00.760 --> 26:03.190
She tell you anything?

26:03.240 --> 26:04.590
Yeah, she did, actually.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.950
She knows where the
other girl's body is.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.070
They were in on it together.
Some weird sexual thing, you know?

26:11.120 --> 26:14.350
After they killed them,
they shagged each other's brains out.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.870
Fucking hell!

26:15.920 --> 26:18.630
Look, professionally speaking,
this is none of your business.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.430
One call,
I can have you thrown out of here.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.870
Fine, but you just remember this...

26:22.920 --> 26:25.910
whatever that twat she's married to
has done, and it might be nothing,

26:25.960 --> 26:27.072
she has done nothing wrong.

26:27.272 --> 26:28.590
You sure about that?
Yeah.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.080
Cos you're old school friends?
No, because I'm good at my job.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.640
Oh, God!

26:46.720 --> 26:48.310
Bloody TVs in pubs.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.630
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.
Have you got a table for two?

26:50.680 --> 26:52.310
Oh... Ten minutes?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.644
If you want to wait,
you can get a drink at the bar.

26:54.744 --> 26:55.560
Yeah, fine.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.790
I was wondering about heading back home.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.768
I mean,
there's nothing else we can do here.

27:02.868 --> 27:03.910
No. No, not yet.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.670
I mean, you can go back if you want,
but I've got to stay. For Linda.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.150
Helen? Helen Weeks?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.790
It's me!
Oh, my God!

27:12.840 --> 27:14.910
Don't tell me you don't remember?

27:14.960 --> 27:18.510
No, of course I do.
Paula Days, your Jenny's mate!

27:18.560 --> 27:19.870
I know, I know.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.480
Ah!

27:23.760 --> 27:27.470
Fancy seeing you here.
Days and Weeks back together.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.190
I looked for you a few times
on Facebook. Are you not on it?

27:31.240 --> 27:33.390
No.
Oh, you should. It's a laugh.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.240
Your Jenny's looking well,
under all the tiredness.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.030
Is this your fella?
Oh, yeah, sorry. This is Paul.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.070
Pleased to meet you.
Mm! Copper, is he?

27:45.120 --> 27:47.630
Well, it's the face, apparently.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.750
Yeah, the place is swarming with them.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.830
Yeah, we both are, actually.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.150
No way! You, filth?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.070
No offence.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.070
So, what do you do?
I'm a nurse.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.760
What a right load of do-gooders we are!

28:03.000 --> 28:04.910
Hey! Gav!

28:04.960 --> 28:06.590
Still waiting for a bloody table.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.270
This is Helen, a mate from school.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.709
Hiya.
This is her fella, Paul.

28:10.809 --> 28:12.030
You all right, mate?

28:12.080 --> 28:14.310
This is Gavin, local sex god.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.190
At your service!
How's it been?

28:16.240 --> 28:18.030
Bloody mental.
I ain't stopped since lunch.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.152
He's a cabbie.
Oh, right.

28:19.252 --> 28:20.710
It's crazy, mate, I'm telling you.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.790
It's like the circus has come to town.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.670
Mind you, I'm not complaining.
It all helps pay for my sweetheart.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.070
Aw!
It's not me. He means his four-by-four.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.590
I swear to God, he'd shag that
thing if it wasn't illegal.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.950
Oh, well, I'm not sure it is illegal.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.240
Might be, in public.
Coppers.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.510
Better check my road tax is up to date,
then.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.590
Trevor!

28:43.640 --> 28:46.590
Pint of lager, and a snakebite and
black, when you're ready, mate.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.590
You OK?
What can I get you?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.390
Oh, erm, half a lager.
Pint of Guinness. Thanks.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.950
Pint of Guinness and half a
lager as well, please, mate.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.910
So, are you, erm,
are you here for the murders?

28:56.960 --> 28:58.710
Keep your voice down!

28:58.760 --> 29:01.110
He knows Stephen Bates, don't you?

29:01.160 --> 29:02.710
And do you think he did it?

29:02.760 --> 29:03.990
Not a clue.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.230
I mean, either way,
it wouldn't surprise me.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.710
You know,
who knows what goes on up there?

29:08.760 --> 29:10.750
I mean, no-one really knows anyone,
do they?

29:10.800 --> 29:13.710
Table's ready.
Oh. Can you make it for four?

29:13.760 --> 29:15.830
Oh, no, no, no. No, we couldn't.
I insist!

29:15.880 --> 29:18.670
I want to hear all the
gossip about Jenny.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.150
Um... are you... are you sure?

29:21.200 --> 29:23.790
Yes!
OK, fine, yeah.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.430
You go, I'll get these in.
Ah, fantastic.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.840
Copper with his hand in his pocket.
Someone take a photograph!

29:31.800 --> 29:33.750
Oh, God!

29:33.800 --> 29:35.990
Helen? Come on.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.120
Erm...

29:39.600 --> 29:41.830
After you.
Oh, thank you!

29:41.880 --> 29:42.794
You're welcome.

29:42.994 --> 29:44.640
He's all right!
Yeah.

29:45.960 --> 29:46.727
11 weeks?
Yeah.

29:46.827 --> 29:47.870
So, that's, what...?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.230
Oh, it's October.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.550
Wow! Autumn baby! Are you excited?

29:52.600 --> 29:54.910
Oh, definitely. Can't wait.
Yep.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.630
Colic, nappy rash,
six hours to leave the house,

29:57.680 --> 30:00.390
every possession we've got
covered in snot and baby food.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.910
I can't wait!

30:01.960 --> 30:03.710
You'll need a bigger motor.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.870
Oh, here he goes! Are you going
to recommend a four-by-four?

30:07.920 --> 30:11.550
Right, she takes the piss,
but they are the best car you can buy.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.470
I've been doing runs down
to the lower villages

30:14.520 --> 30:17.550
and they are perfect in the flooding.
Sails like a yacht.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.030
Amount of water down there,
you'd need a yacht!

30:21.440 --> 30:23.030
So, what are yous doing tomorrow?

30:23.080 --> 30:25.470
Oh...
Oh, I don't know. Lazy day, maybe.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.430
Yeah. Spot of surfing.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.190
Why don't you come over?

30:29.240 --> 30:32.550
We'll do brunch,
I'll dig out all the old photos,

30:32.600 --> 30:35.630
we'll give these two a
laugh at our hairstyles.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.510
Oh, that is lovely, Paula,
but we might just chill out

30:38.560 --> 30:40.190
and go and see Linda again.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.070
Oh, right. Yeah. OK.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.350
Maybe another day.
Yeah, yeah.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.550
I mean, I'm being pushy, anyway,
because we weren't even friends.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.200
I mean, you weren't even that nice to me.
What? I'm sorry?

30:55.160 --> 30:56.950
You and Linda.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.270
I don't know, I think it was because
we were two years younger than you,

31:00.320 --> 31:03.710
me and Jenny,
but you didn't really want us around.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.230
Paula, that... that's not true.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.390
Come on! Always trying to get rid of us.

31:09.440 --> 31:12.150
You used to bully us quite a bit.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.310
Bully you?

31:14.360 --> 31:15.790
Paula!

31:15.840 --> 31:17.920
Don't pretend you don't remember.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.960
Look, if I did, Paula, I... I'm sorry.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.680
Hm. Long time ago now.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.670
No, I think it's lovely,

31:37.720 --> 31:41.600
you know, that you've come back
for Linda at a time like this.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.150
Hey! Hey. You all right?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.960
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.398
Well,
I never had you down as a school bully.

32:05.498 --> 32:06.310
I wasn't.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.830
I'd better watch my step.
No, she's full of shit!

32:09.880 --> 32:12.670
We might not have wanted
her and Jenny around,

32:12.720 --> 32:14.760
but, God, we never hurt them!

32:24.040 --> 32:26.840
Who's that?
It's no-one. It's just work.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.950
Helen, I need to speak to you.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.040
Call me as soon as you can.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.670
I'm helping DI Cornish.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.440
OK, you can go in.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.360
Anything interesting?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.030
DI Helen Weeks.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.830
Manchester?
Been seconded.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.790
Interesting stuff's already gone
to the lab. We're just tidying up.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.565
What stuff?

34:44.764 --> 34:48.590
Fag end they got very excited about,
in with the body.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.150
Who found it, the body?

34:50.199 --> 34:52.830
An old man walking his dog.
Same old story.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.550
The dog did most of the digging for us.
It's not very deep.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.230
What state was it in?

34:57.280 --> 35:00.350
The dog? Traumatised.
It was his first dead human.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.150
She's been in there a while.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.960
Burst open, so it's all a bit insect-y.
There's photos.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.120
Yeah, not pretty.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.070
No, I'm... Hm!

35:25.120 --> 35:28.150
I'm pregnant. It's, um...
It's morning sickness.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.960
Whatever you say.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.950
The body's burned.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.600
By the looks. It's pretty stinky.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.710
Well, there goes the killer's DNA.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.880
That's probably why he did it.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.480
Thanks very much.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.520
Fucking hell! Come on!

36:28.840 --> 36:30.990
Piss off! Sod off!

36:31.040 --> 36:33.550
Sod off! Piss off! Sod off!

36:46.000 --> 36:48.640
Morning... kind of!
Morning.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.510
Big dog-walking area, this, is it?
These woods?

36:53.560 --> 36:56.430
Yeah, everyone comes here.
Or they used to, before, erm...

36:56.480 --> 36:58.030
Yeah. Yeah.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.680
The dogs love it.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.470
OK. Well, have a good walk.

37:05.520 --> 37:09.320
Thanks. And, erm, don't worry,
I didn't see anything.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.110
Is she all right... Helen?

37:18.160 --> 37:20.910
She's fine. I think the
pregnancy took her by surprise.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.790
It wasn't like we were trying.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.230
But you're both happy about it?
I am, definitely.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.870
And Helen?

37:27.920 --> 37:32.110
Well, you know Helen, she's so...
driven.

37:32.160 --> 37:35.550
I think she's worried about spending
too much time away from it all.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.510
Hm! Or maybe she's scared
about how much she'll love it.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.670
Why does she never come back?
Ah!

37:41.720 --> 37:44.190
I mean, I know she says it's
to do with her mum, but...

37:44.240 --> 37:47.910
I don't know.
She had tough teen years. Moody.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.360
Helen always had... big ambitions.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.190
I think this place represents

37:54.240 --> 37:56.470
everything she didn't want for her life.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.590
Her biggest fear was
becoming someone like Linda.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.470
Either that or she's ashamed
her old dad's found love again.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.070
Oh, hardly!
It's time I was getting back. You coming?

38:05.120 --> 38:07.110
No, no,
I think I'm going to head into town,

38:07.160 --> 38:10.590
get a cup of tea, or something.
Something? Is it that time already?

38:10.640 --> 38:13.870
Yeah. See you.
See you in a bit.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.120
Come on, boy.
Come on, lad, let's go home.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.320
Hello?

39:23.800 --> 39:25.360
Hello?

39:31.600 --> 39:33.000
Hello?

40:25.400 --> 40:26.880
Gavin!

40:43.360 --> 40:45.910
Do you mind if I breathe
in some real smoke?

40:45.960 --> 40:48.550
You packed it in?
Yeah, sort of.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.590
That one kills you, apparently.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.080
You've got to die of something.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.440
I'm Paul.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.110
Shelley.
Just Shelley?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.110
It's what they call me.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.870
Love to read it. Write a bit, too.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.670
Oh! Poetry-writing chef.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.880
I'm a copper, before you ask.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.400
Whatever floats your boat.
Oh.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.470
I'll... I'll leave you to it.
Yeah, that's a good idea, yeah.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.510
Hello, you.
Hiya.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.910
Hey!
Hiya!

41:37.960 --> 41:39.510
What are you having?
Just an orange.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.910
And an orange juice, please.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.510
How's it going?
Yeah.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.190
Oh, Helen, this is Trevor.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.030
It's my name over the door.
Ah.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.790
So, let me guess, coppers?

41:49.840 --> 41:52.990
Have I got a sign on my face,
or something?

41:53.040 --> 41:56.230
They say the gays have a radar for
each other. I think coppers do.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.270
I'm ex-force.
Oh.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.950
30 years' service.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.270
Oh, well, we're...
we're just on holiday.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.790
I heard he drank in here, Bates.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.910
I thought you were on holiday?

42:06.960 --> 42:08.990
He's a normal bloke, is Stephen.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.790
He's got some funny politics.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.950
A bit towards the left for my liking.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.430
That's not a crime, is it?

42:14.480 --> 42:17.550
So the girl was in his car.
It doesn't prove much.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.430
Small town like this,
people give each other lifts.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.790
My boy goes to St Mary's.
I've had both those girls in my car.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.550
So have I. Many a time.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.430
Lovely girl, that Abigail.
Not like some of them.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.270
I mean, she liked a drink

42:30.320 --> 42:33.390
and she had one of them
stupid tattoos they all have.

42:33.440 --> 42:37.150
A huge rose. But that's like
goody-two-shoes around here.

42:37.200 --> 42:37.864
All right, Bob?

42:38.064 --> 42:40.190
Oh, here we go,
the entertainment's arrived!

42:40.240 --> 42:42.390
Pint of best.
Afternoon, Bob!

42:44.080 --> 42:46.950
Bob was in here the other week,
shouting about how someone

42:47.000 --> 42:50.030
had been on his farm in the middle
of the night and, what was it,

42:50.080 --> 42:51.150
nicked some piglet?

42:52.200 --> 42:55.070
Accusing all and bloody sundry,
weren't you, Bob?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.550
Aye, well, some bastard took 'em.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.230
Giving me the third degree.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.510
Seeing if I had spareribs on the menu.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.640
Aye, and I'm still bloody watching you.
And you!

43:06.400 --> 43:09.310
And you wonder why I never come back.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.870
'Breaking news tonight.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.550
Polesford resident Stephen
Bates has been charged

43:13.600 --> 43:15.910
with the murder of
teenager Abigail Toms.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.230
Abigail's burned remains were
discovered in woodland yesterday.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.430
Poppy Johnston is still missing.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.470
37-year-old Bates will appear

43:23.520 --> 43:26.200
in East Midlands Magistrates'
Court tomorrow.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.320
I don't think he killed those girls.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.350
Something doesn't feel right.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.750
Look, do you not think you're
getting too close to this?

43:36.800 --> 43:38.510
I mean,
I know she's an old friend, but...

43:38.560 --> 43:40.950
Up until a few weeks ago,
he was a normal family man.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.040
Hardworking. No-one ever had a bad word.

43:45.240 --> 43:49.110
And then, suddenly, he decides to
pick up young girls and murder them?

43:49.160 --> 43:51.270
It happens. You know it happens.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.830
It could've been in his mind for years.

43:53.880 --> 43:57.200
Like that dick Gavin Sweeney said,
everybody's got secrets.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.000
You OK?

44:07.280 --> 44:10.080
We need to speak to your
mate Cornish first thing.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.190
Ah, the famous Helen Weeks.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.470
Nice suit.
I'm in court later.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.310
It's only a first hearing.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.350
You should see what I got for the trial.

44:27.400 --> 44:31.150
So, erm, you guys here to
congratulate me on nailing my man?

44:31.200 --> 44:32.750
It's a bit early for that, isn't it?

44:32.800 --> 44:35.190
No, we've, erm,
we've got a stupid question for you.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.600
What, you have or she has?

44:39.480 --> 44:42.190
We were wondering when the last
time the woods were searched.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.710
Where the body was found.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.150
You mean the last time
the woods were searched

44:46.200 --> 44:47.870
before the body was found?
Mm-hm.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.150
I'd need to check to be absolutely sure.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.750
The search was a bit of a
nightmare because of the floods.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.590
Oh, the woods weren't flooded.
They never get flooded.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.058
I'm talking about the
organisational side of it.

44:58.158 --> 44:58.670
Ah.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.750
I'd need to check. Why?

45:00.800 --> 45:03.190
I was down there yesterday.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.670
Out having a stroll, were you?

45:04.720 --> 45:07.590
That place is a dog-walkers'
heaven morning, noon and night,

45:07.640 --> 45:10.230
so why did it take till yesterday
for one of them to find her?

45:10.280 --> 45:11.470
I'm not being funny,

45:11.520 --> 45:13.590
but you might have to put
this one down to chance, OK?

45:13.640 --> 45:14.078
It happens.

45:14.278 --> 45:16.470
How can she have been down
there that long, though?

45:16.520 --> 45:18.070
The only thing we can be certain of

45:18.120 --> 45:20.030
is that she was buried
before we nicked Bates.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.990
Other than that, we can't be certain
how long she was there, can we?

45:23.040 --> 45:24.830
You guys trying to ruin my party?

45:24.880 --> 45:27.150
Look, I gather she was in quite a state,
yeah?

45:27.200 --> 45:28.670
Burned.
Not completely.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.750
Enough to get rid of DNA.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.230
Obviously, Bates knew what he was doing.
Did he?

45:33.280 --> 45:35.310
Why did he leave behind a fag end?

45:35.360 --> 45:37.430
It's always the little things.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.190
I appreciate that you have
a vested interest, Helen.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.590
I understand that, you know,

45:41.640 --> 45:43.717
you have a really close
relationship with...

45:43.817 --> 45:45.150
Oh, no, we're not close.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.230
But in case you've forgotten,
you're supposed to be on our side.

45:48.280 --> 45:51.310
What side? I thought we were
about finding the right person.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.510
And we have.
Have you?

45:53.560 --> 45:55.550
I heard you're pregnant.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.550
Congratulations.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.910
Now, if you're anything like my missus,

45:59.960 --> 46:02.750
right now, you'll probably be
getting a little overemotional.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.004
What the fuck?
Apologise.

46:04.204 --> 46:05.270
I beg your pardon?

46:05.320 --> 46:06.859
I said, apologise.
Oh, no, it's fine.

46:07.059 --> 46:07.950
No. No, it's not.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.470
We're all coppers and we don't talk
to each other like that. Apologise.

46:11.520 --> 46:15.910
Paul, I invited her onto this case,
I extended my hand of friendship...

46:15.960 --> 46:17.680
Tim, apologise!

46:20.960 --> 46:22.390
I'm sorry.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.240
Now, if you'll excuse me...

46:25.480 --> 46:27.390
What about time of death?

46:27.440 --> 46:30.190
SOCO said that the body was
full of insects, burst open.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.390
So she would've been dead for weeks.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.477
Looks like it.
Looks?

46:33.677 --> 46:35.390
Look, I'm not an idiot, all right?

46:35.440 --> 46:38.430
I do understand that she was
dead before she went in the bag

46:38.480 --> 46:40.430
and before the bag went in the hole.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.710
Blowflies don't burrow
down into the soil two feet

46:43.760 --> 46:45.310
to infest a body, do they?

46:45.360 --> 46:47.790
No. So, what did he do with
the body after he killed her?

46:47.840 --> 46:49.350
He likes teen porn!

46:49.400 --> 46:52.150
He picked up Poppy in his car.
We have a DNA match.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.640
It's not going to take a jury long,
is it?

46:56.440 --> 46:58.040
See ya.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.710
Prick!
Yeah, you said it.

47:03.760 --> 47:06.790
Look, I do not need you
standing up for me like that.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.240
What?

47:42.680 --> 47:44.280
All rise.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.920
Bring Stephen Bates to the dock.

48:12.920 --> 48:16.070
Please confirm your name,
address and date of birth.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.030
Stephen Alan Bates.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.310
31 Thornhill Road, Polesford.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.110
Sorry, could you speak up, please?

48:22.160 --> 48:24.070
Stephen Alan Bates.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.590
31 Thornhill R-Road,
Polesford, Derbyshire.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.320
30th November 1978.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.510
You're charged with
the offence of murder,

48:32.560 --> 48:34.990
and that on a day between
the 16th day of March

48:35.040 --> 48:37.070
and the 7th day of April 2016,

48:37.120 --> 48:41.270
you murdered Abigail Toms,
which is contrary to common law.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.310
You're also charged with
two counts of kidnapping...

48:44.360 --> 48:47.390
of Abigail Toms and Poppy Johnston.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.830
Do you want to indicate a plea today?

48:49.880 --> 48:51.280
Not guilty.

48:53.840 --> 48:56.110
There will be no application for bail

48:56.160 --> 48:58.750
out of concern for my client's safety.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.470
These charges are so serious,

49:00.520 --> 49:02.950
I'm sending the case
to Derby Crown Court.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.550
Your case will be listed
in two days from today

49:05.600 --> 49:07.710
for a bail hearing
before the Crown Court,

49:07.760 --> 49:10.310
when a date will be fixed
for the preliminary hearing.

49:10.360 --> 49:11.640
Take him down.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.070
Phil, it's me.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.270
Paul. How's the holiday in murder town?

49:37.320 --> 49:40.270
Oh, it's fine for me.
I think Helen's finding it hard, though.

49:40.320 --> 49:43.950
Yes, well, going home does
strange things to people.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.550
Yeah. Listen, that info I sent you,
did you get a chance to take a look?

49:47.600 --> 49:49.350
Certainly did.
And?

49:49.400 --> 49:52.430
Look, dogs aren't always the
most reliable creatures, Paul.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.030
No, but they're pretty
good at finding bodies.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.510
The smell, whatever.
Not all of them.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.750
My golden Lab sits there all day,
barking at clouds.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.240
He eats cat shit like it's tapas.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.510
Look, Paul, they have DNA,
they have witnesses.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.230
It doesn't feel right, though.

50:09.280 --> 50:11.950
SOCO said the body was barely
in the ground, not very deep,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.350
and yet no-one found it that whole time?

50:14.400 --> 50:16.390
Well, do you know what I think?

50:16.440 --> 50:20.030
You're a killer.
You set fire to the body.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.750
And out with the old Swan
Vestas and up it goes. Whoosh!

50:23.800 --> 50:26.070
But then you rush back over

50:26.120 --> 50:30.080
and put out the fire before
the body's completely burned.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.430
Look, maybe I'm going nowhere with this

50:33.480 --> 50:36.830
and maybe he just couldn't bear to
see her all burned up like that,

50:36.880 --> 50:39.640
but maybe...
maybe it was something different.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.070
Perhaps he loved her.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.870
But, as I say,
I could be talking out of my arse.

50:46.920 --> 50:50.840
No. No, thanks, Phil, that's...
that's really helpful.

50:56.600 --> 50:58.040
Just stay back!

51:06.120 --> 51:08.510
Tensions have been rising on this estate

51:08.560 --> 51:10.590
ever since these two girls disappeared.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.750
Now Linda Bates has returned home,

51:12.800 --> 51:14.830
having seen her husband
Stephen in court,

51:14.880 --> 51:17.310
charged with the murder of Abigail Toms.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.830
Meanwhile...

51:22.440 --> 51:24.510
I'm sorry, I need to take this.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.190
Yeah, sure.
Are you OK?

51:26.240 --> 51:27.800
Tickety-boo.

51:29.040 --> 51:31.990
Hello, sir.
Helen, what the hell are you playing at?

51:32.040 --> 51:35.230
Oh, it's nice to hear from you, too, sir.
Don't mess me around.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.550
You're on my screen, on my news feed,

51:37.600 --> 51:39.790
side by side with a killer's wife.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.150
Yeah, well, I can explain, sir.
I don't care.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.600
This is high profile.
This isn't coming just from me.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.830
Helen, I'm saying this as a friend.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.040
Move yourself away from it.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.680
You all right?

52:31.080 --> 52:34.320
Do you ever think about what
happened all them years ago?

52:39.440 --> 52:41.520
Every fucking day.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.270
Adam, wh...

53:29.320 --> 53:32.640
You should know better than
to tell Mickey anything.

53:34.360 --> 53:35.870
So...

53:35.920 --> 53:37.760
Is it mine?

54:12.600 --> 54:15.350
Stephen Bates has persistently refused

54:15.400 --> 54:17.510
to tell police where our daughter is.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.550
She has been missing for five days now

54:19.600 --> 54:21.590
and we are desperate to hear from her.

54:21.640 --> 54:23.150
Still think he didn't do it?

54:23.200 --> 54:25.150
I admit,
it doesn't exactly scream innocence.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.550
What is this place?
Hell on earth.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.270
You've been weird ever
since we came down here.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.350
There's something.
I know there's something.

54:32.400 --> 54:34.230
I feel so guilty, Linda.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.310
We were 13 years old.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.950
We were little girls.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.390
I'm hoping you'll help me
prove he didn't kill anyone.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.870
So, what are you saying,
you think Poppy's still alive?

54:43.920 --> 54:47.270
I think she might be, yeah.
I think it's possible.

54:47.320 --> 54:50.550
You don't believe her, do you?
No. I don't.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.150
Know your enemy.

54:52.200 --> 54:55.190
We learned that a long time ago,
didn't we?

54:55.240 --> 54:58.280
I know who killed Abigail Toms.
