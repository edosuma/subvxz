01:55.058 --> 01:58.338
I swear to God
I had nothing to do with this.

01:58.438 --> 02:00.867
We would love to believe you,
Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit

02:00.967 --> 02:03.660
your version of events does sound
pretty bizarre, don't you think?

02:04.060 --> 02:07.089
Look. It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.

02:07.189 --> 02:10.261
So you were framed. That's your claim?
You were the victim.

02:10.561 --> 02:13.067
Well, I mean, you know,
not... not like...

02:13.167 --> 02:16.808
Not like who? Not like her?

02:17.108 --> 02:19.596
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?

02:19.696 --> 02:20.841
We're doing our jobs.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.979
So why don't you just do yourself
a favor and confess?

02:23.079 --> 02:25.659
You know, save some time,
save some legal fees. Come on.

02:25.759 --> 02:28.398
Why don't you take us through
the events of this morning?

02:28.498 --> 02:30.502
- Again?
- Again, Mr. Stevens.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.022
Where were you this morning,
Mr. Stevens?

05:11.122 --> 05:14.629
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.

05:14.729 --> 05:17.033
Actually your wife's on her way back,
as we speak.

05:17.134 --> 05:20.707
Apparently, she has...
quite a few questions of her own.

05:21.007 --> 05:23.078
So the phone woke you around
what time this morning?

05:23.179 --> 05:27.861
I don't know. 9:00, 9:30. It was Luke
in a panic. He said I had to come.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.090
Where were you supposed to go?

05:29.191 --> 05:31.094
To the loft. He told me
to come to the loft.

05:31.195 --> 05:33.295
- Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.

05:33.395 --> 05:37.725
- Did you know why he was panicking?
- No, not yet.

05:53.406 --> 05:54.442
Luke.

05:57.814 --> 05:59.684
Luke?

06:07.968 --> 06:09.472
Oh, my God.

06:19.925 --> 06:22.498
Oh, fuck.

06:26.773 --> 06:29.244
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

06:29.444 --> 06:33.987
- What do you mean? You just... What...
- I walked in, she was lying there.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.424
Oh, fuck.

06:38.562 --> 06:41.568
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.406
I... I still haven't reached Philip.

06:43.506 --> 06:46.478
Okay, well, keep calling.
We need everybody here.

06:47.279 --> 06:49.417
Do you know who she is?

06:49.517 --> 06:52.034
Vincent, do you know who's lying there?

06:52.134 --> 06:56.031
What? No, of course not.

06:56.131 --> 06:59.270
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or...

06:59.370 --> 07:03.178
Windows are sealed, the door was locked,
and the alarm was turned off.

07:03.278 --> 07:05.349
- That's impossible.
- I'm telling you, the door was locked.

07:05.449 --> 07:07.186
And the alarm was turned off.

07:07.987 --> 07:11.997
- But that would mean that...
- Someone got in with one of our keys.

07:16.304 --> 07:19.477
Do you know the loft building at the corner
of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?

07:19.577 --> 07:22.150
- No.
- The new residential one by the Sports Arena?

07:22.250 --> 07:24.721
Designed, I believe,
by your good friend Vincent Stevens.

07:24.821 --> 07:27.871
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.

07:27.971 --> 07:30.833
There's a loft on the ninth floor,
Mr. Seacord. Have you ever been there?

07:30.933 --> 07:32.170
No.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.908
Strange, because according
to our information,

07:35.008 --> 07:39.350
you and four friends are sharing this loft
secretly, without your wives' knowledge.

07:39.450 --> 07:41.053
That is ridiculous.

07:41.154 --> 07:43.258
Don't the five of you
bring women up there?

07:43.358 --> 07:46.798
Girlfriends, mistresses,
one-night stands, catch of the day.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.339
Five pals just looking
for privacy and fun

07:50.439 --> 07:53.212
without the hassle of Visa statements
and hotel bills the missus might find.

07:53.312 --> 07:56.541
- That is preposterous.
- Maybe, Mr. Seacord,

07:56.641 --> 08:01.042
but one of your friends already made
a full confession. You want to know who?

08:01.142 --> 08:04.183
Listen, I don't do things
like that. You know?

08:04.284 --> 08:06.170
Fool around with other women. I...

08:06.270 --> 08:09.677
- You love your wife.
- I love my wife, yes.

08:09.777 --> 08:12.716
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?

08:13.116 --> 08:14.788
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?

08:14.888 --> 08:17.593
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?

08:17.693 --> 08:20.231
Out with Chris, having breakfast.

08:20.331 --> 08:22.202
There will be a lot of people
in the restaurant to verify that.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.674
By Chris, you mean
Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?

08:25.074 --> 08:26.745
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?

08:26.845 --> 08:28.567
Chris is married. He's got two kids.

08:28.667 --> 08:32.455
And he's not a guy
who cheats on his wife either.

08:35.428 --> 08:38.433
I got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.973
Oh, shit.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.378
Philip.

09:00.478 --> 09:04.186
Philip? You think your brother
has something to do with this?

09:04.286 --> 09:06.991
I don't know. We gotta call the cops.

09:07.091 --> 09:10.047
You realize what'll happen if we call
the cops? Think about our wives.

09:10.147 --> 09:13.405
- There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
- Why do we think Philip is involved?

09:13.505 --> 09:15.374
Look, Chris,
you know what he's capable of.

09:15.474 --> 09:17.446
Yeah, I know.

09:17.546 --> 09:21.088
Maybe we can help him, okay? If we can
just figure out what the fuck happened,

09:21.188 --> 09:23.257
- maybe we could...
- We gonna dump the body somewhere?

09:23.357 --> 09:27.198
Look, I don't fucking know,
but I'm not taking the fall for this!

09:36.383 --> 09:39.389
- Marty.
- Son of a bitch.

09:39.489 --> 09:43.797
Have you seen Phil? Do you know
where he is? Was he here last night?

09:43.897 --> 09:45.183
This can't be real.

09:49.543 --> 09:51.814
No. Wait, what are you doing?

09:52.315 --> 09:54.520
I want to see her.

10:02.648 --> 10:04.314
Just put her back.

10:05.308 --> 10:07.029
- Goddamn it.
- Who is she?

10:07.330 --> 10:08.381
I don't know.

10:08.481 --> 10:11.186
Look, none of us has anything
to do with this, right?

10:12.422 --> 10:14.025
Right?

10:14.125 --> 10:17.465
We're gonna find out what happened here,
and we will figure a way out.

10:17.565 --> 10:20.538
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together. Okay?

10:20.738 --> 10:24.346
'Cause we're friends. Agreed?

10:24.446 --> 10:26.424
Agreed?

10:39.809 --> 10:41.447
Well, it looks like
they'll let anybody in, right?

10:41.747 --> 10:43.416
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.289
- This one's really spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.

10:46.389 --> 10:48.193
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.

10:48.293 --> 10:49.470
Thank you.

10:49.570 --> 10:53.905
- So, what do you think?
- Well, it's bold and focused, as always.

10:54.005 --> 10:55.975
- I like it.
- Great. You made it.

10:56.075 --> 10:57.511
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:57.612 --> 11:00.651
- Hi, Barbara. How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves a little condo?

11:00.751 --> 11:02.956
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.

11:03.056 --> 11:05.595
Right. You and your puny
psychiatrist's salary.

11:05.695 --> 11:07.999
You guys grab a drink
and we'll catch up with you later.

11:08.099 --> 11:10.905
- All right. Congrats, bud.
- Thanks, man.

11:11.706 --> 11:15.682
- One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
- Come on, hon. We just got here.

11:17.351 --> 11:19.488
Man, check out all these babes. So hot!

11:19.588 --> 11:21.626
It's like they're in violation
of the fuckin' fire code.

11:21.727 --> 11:25.568
Marty, calm down. I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.

11:26.536 --> 11:30.344
- Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
- What's up, Tubs? Having too much fun?

11:30.444 --> 11:34.384
Nope. Just checkin' out the hipster crowd
with my pal Luke.

11:34.484 --> 11:36.824
Yeah, if you embarrass me,
I'll leave you here all by yourself.

11:36.924 --> 11:39.695
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them.

11:40.754 --> 11:42.067
Hi, Luke. Where's Ellie?

11:42.167 --> 11:45.707
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.

11:46.008 --> 11:48.046
Hi, Elle. Do you feel okay?

11:48.146 --> 11:52.321
Oh, I started to feel
not so great before, but I'm better now.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.291
We can always go home, sweetie.

11:54.391 --> 11:57.197
Did you hear that? "Sweetie."
After she just checked her blood sugar.

11:57.297 --> 11:59.335
That's funny. That's really good.

11:59.435 --> 12:01.639
I would love to see you deal
with something like that if that was me.

12:01.739 --> 12:04.211
Oh, you know, baby. I'd love
to stick you in the ass every day.

12:04.311 --> 12:07.185
- How many times have I asked? Lots.
- Honey? Not now.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.846
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right. Chris Vanowen.

12:22.046 --> 12:25.045
Dr. Vanowen. That's right.
Yes, I remember.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.393
- Do we know each other?
- No. You knew my sister.

12:28.493 --> 12:33.769
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie? Sophie Morris?

12:35.774 --> 12:38.112
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

12:38.212 --> 12:41.786
Some people are just born unhappy.

12:42.186 --> 12:44.141
I'm sorry. Are you buying an apartment?

12:44.241 --> 12:48.699
What? No. No, no.
I'm friends with the architect.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.570
Are you?

12:50.670 --> 12:53.910
No. No, I'm here with...
Joel Kotkin, the city councilman.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.782
I work for him
as sort of a personal assistant.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.803
- I'm Anne. Anne Morris.
- Very nice to meet you, Anne.

13:02.242 --> 13:05.037
- And listen, about your sister...
- It's okay.

13:05.137 --> 13:08.952
You couldn't have saved her. Her mood
disorder kind of runs in the family,

13:09.052 --> 13:11.010
unfortunately, so...

13:11.612 --> 13:14.652
Well, you're not thinking of doing
something stupid, are you, Anne?

13:14.752 --> 13:18.560
Me? You mean like falling
for the wrong man?

13:18.660 --> 13:21.498
Well, I do that all the time.

13:30.516 --> 13:33.574
Everything's all right! Come on.
Keep partying. What are you doing?

13:33.675 --> 13:36.656
- Phil, I should've guessed.
- Hey, Vince. What's up?

13:36.757 --> 13:40.122
- How are you? Thanks for comin'.
- I'm sorry about this. She slipped.

13:40.222 --> 13:42.239
No worries. As long as you're okay.
You all right?

13:42.339 --> 13:45.612
She's fine. Let me introduce you to a...

13:45.712 --> 13:48.052
colleague who works with me
up the office.

13:48.152 --> 13:52.726
And this one works with me
down at the office.

13:53.362 --> 13:55.666
- Or is it the other way around?
- Philip.

13:55.766 --> 13:59.173
Oh, my big brother. How you doin', man?

13:59.273 --> 14:02.847
- Friends of Vicky's? Bridesmaids?
- Come on, man. I'm still single.

14:02.948 --> 14:05.486
- What are you doing?
- It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.

14:05.586 --> 14:07.390
I love her madly. You know that.
All right?

14:07.490 --> 14:09.414
It's not like I hate
all the other women in the world.

14:09.514 --> 14:11.369
All right. Relax.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.071
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.

14:23.554 --> 14:25.453
Chris.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.907
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.

14:33.007 --> 14:36.046
Wow. This is impressive, Vince.

14:36.347 --> 14:41.074
Check out the view. Then imagine
this is our own private oasis

14:41.175 --> 14:43.262
right in the heart of downtown.

14:43.462 --> 14:46.868
- What do you mean?
- A place where no one hassles you.

14:46.968 --> 14:50.107
A place you can escape to
any time you want.

14:50.207 --> 14:54.604
- So this is your loft?
- No. It's ours. If you want it.

14:54.704 --> 14:56.721
What? Ours?

14:56.821 --> 14:58.325
Think about it.

14:58.425 --> 15:02.833
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.

15:02.933 --> 15:06.618
This would be our secret place...
to steal away,

15:06.718 --> 15:10.783
discreetly and economically...
in these challenging times.

15:10.883 --> 15:13.353
Five-way split.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.624
What do you think?

15:16.093 --> 15:17.730
I don't know. I'm not like that.

15:18.230 --> 15:21.538
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little like that.

15:21.638 --> 15:24.212
Yeah, tell me about it. Give me your key
right now. Bring your twins up here,

15:24.312 --> 15:27.259
- give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost, Marty?

15:27.359 --> 15:29.793
How much? I might have it
on me right now. Seriously.

15:29.893 --> 15:32.626
Think about it. It's a great investment.

15:32.726 --> 15:37.068
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.

15:45.084 --> 15:46.790
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?

15:46.890 --> 15:47.974
Luke!

15:48.074 --> 15:51.630
You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said.

15:51.731 --> 15:53.835
All right. Luke, you need
to calm the fuck down.

15:53.935 --> 15:56.264
No! No! It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!

15:56.364 --> 15:58.800
It's not over. Listen.
We're gonna find out what happened here

15:58.900 --> 16:01.172
and we're gonna fix it. Okay?

16:03.103 --> 16:05.178
Try Phil again.

16:14.709 --> 16:17.716
This is Philip. Please leave a message
after the tone.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.655
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.

16:23.755 --> 16:24.636
He'll show.

16:24.736 --> 16:27.535
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.

16:27.635 --> 16:30.175
Guys? Look at this.

16:44.135 --> 16:47.642
What does it mean? What does it mean?

16:51.417 --> 16:53.932
You know Latin, Doctor?

16:54.032 --> 16:58.129
- Excuse me?
- Latin. Do you know Latin?

16:59.097 --> 17:01.670
I took it premed, yeah.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.441
What's it say on the wall there?

17:05.277 --> 17:08.215
Fatum nos iungebit.

17:08.884 --> 17:12.986
Yeah, I know. Fatum nos iungebit.

17:13.393 --> 17:16.400
I can read that. What's it mean?

17:16.599 --> 17:19.204
I'm guessing you already know
what it means.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.296
No. We would like to hear you say it.

17:21.396 --> 17:25.116
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay. Fatum nos iungebit.

17:25.617 --> 17:28.195
Fate will unite us.

17:28.296 --> 17:32.097
Now, all I can possibly think is that
somebody who knows Latin like you

17:32.197 --> 17:36.641
reached over with this young lady's hand
and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.

17:38.611 --> 17:42.657
- Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- How so, Doctor?

17:42.757 --> 17:46.092
The future imperfect tense
of the verb unite, iungere...

17:46.192 --> 17:49.562
is not iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say "Fatum nos iunget."

17:49.662 --> 17:52.894
So the person you're looking for
made a classic Latin error.

17:52.994 --> 17:56.212
But I'm guessing you knew that
already too, didn't you?

17:59.151 --> 18:02.826
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.346
Where's your brother?

18:09.446 --> 18:12.040
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that one.

18:12.140 --> 18:16.473
Actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.754
He spent some time in various institutions
with your half-sister Zoe?

18:19.855 --> 18:22.564
Yeah, that's right.

18:22.664 --> 18:25.237
After our mother died...

18:25.972 --> 18:30.180
Philip wasn't...
wasn't as lucky with his father.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.596
Apparently not. Alcoholic child beater.

18:33.837 --> 18:35.757
You didn't spend much time
with Philip back then, did you?

18:35.857 --> 18:38.931
- No.
- But now you're best friends.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.139
We've had a lot of catching up to do.

18:43.239 --> 18:46.179
You really don't know
where we can find him?

18:49.986 --> 18:52.590
Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?

18:52.690 --> 18:53.603
I don't know.

18:56.699 --> 18:58.433
What the hell is this?

18:58.533 --> 19:01.109
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.

19:06.969 --> 19:09.392
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.

19:10.794 --> 19:13.800
- You did this!
- Luke! Luke, Luke, Luke!

19:13.900 --> 19:16.539
- Come here! Hey! Hey!
- Hands off! Come on. Bring it on!

19:16.639 --> 19:19.184
- Cool it.
- What is this?

19:19.862 --> 19:20.720
Shit.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.183
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- What the fuck you talkin' about?

19:23.284 --> 19:25.118
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?

19:25.218 --> 19:27.428
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.

19:27.528 --> 19:30.232
- Were you here last night?
- No, man, I wasn't here last night.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.038
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.842
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?

19:34.942 --> 19:38.950
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.

19:39.050 --> 19:41.689
My God. Where were you last night?

19:41.789 --> 19:43.593
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.

19:43.693 --> 19:45.464
Before accusing everyone else,
where have you been?

19:45.764 --> 19:49.972
'Cause I never got a text saying
the loft was taken. Never.

19:50.072 --> 19:51.576
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?

19:51.676 --> 19:54.013
No, I can't prove it
'cause Barbara's taken the kids skiing.

19:54.113 --> 19:56.118
- You'll have to take my word for it.
- Your word?

19:56.418 --> 20:00.277
There's a dead woman in our loft
that only us have access to.

20:00.377 --> 20:04.000
If anybody has anything to do with this,
now's the time to say it, right now.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.158
Philip's got a ball and chain now.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.097
- Who would have thunk it?
- Who's the father-in-law again?

20:19.497 --> 20:22.705
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.972
His friends call him "the man of steel."

20:25.272 --> 20:27.866
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.

20:27.966 --> 20:31.455
- So what's not to love?
- I just hope Philip will be happy.

20:35.663 --> 20:38.201
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?

20:38.401 --> 20:40.573
Ever since Councilman Kotkin
got elected,

20:40.673 --> 20:42.710
the man of steel's been busy
rebuilding downtown.

20:42.811 --> 20:45.990
- Kotkin came to your opening, right?
- Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.

20:46.090 --> 20:50.052
When it comes to handing out permits
and contracts though, the game's rigged.

20:50.152 --> 20:52.933
Tell me what we're talking about again
'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.

21:06.825 --> 21:08.629
Gorgeous?

21:10.465 --> 21:12.937
I mean, this whole setup.

21:13.038 --> 21:17.446
Whoever said money can't buy happiness
sure hasn't lived this life.

21:24.260 --> 21:28.689
Sorry, boys. You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.

21:28.789 --> 21:32.075
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.

21:32.176 --> 21:35.252
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- She told you!

21:35.352 --> 21:39.122
And it's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.

21:39.222 --> 21:40.493
Soon as we're back from Fiji.

21:40.593 --> 21:43.399
Yeah. Well, gonna sell
some properties with Vicky's dad.

21:43.599 --> 21:47.172
- You know, see how it grabs me.
- Grabs you.

21:48.442 --> 21:50.412
Well, guys, thanks for coming.

21:50.512 --> 21:52.116
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

21:52.216 --> 21:56.190
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
I need a break from all the ass-kissing.

21:56.290 --> 21:57.693
Shit.

21:57.793 --> 22:00.632
- Where is Fiji?
- I don't know, man.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.928
Phil?

22:16.296 --> 22:17.767
Your wedding present.

22:20.004 --> 22:22.108
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely. Don't lose it.

22:22.208 --> 22:25.081
There's only five of these in existence.

22:30.058 --> 22:34.676
Accepting a key to the loft means
you accept the rules to the loft. Marty?

22:34.776 --> 22:36.939
What, are you crazy? Our wives are here.

22:40.477 --> 22:42.850
Don't you think that's a bit cynical,
handing those things out here?

22:42.950 --> 22:46.424
Cynical? It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.

22:47.793 --> 22:49.603
Oh, no, you're not like that.

22:49.703 --> 22:53.755
Not now. Maybe later.
What about you, Luke? Now or later?

22:55.241 --> 22:57.265
Come on.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.624
- That-a-boy.
- Oh, wow.

23:02.724 --> 23:05.178
You just make sure this doesn't
blow up in your faces.

23:05.278 --> 23:08.138
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.

23:08.238 --> 23:10.396
Our room.

23:10.738 --> 23:12.542
Now, we keep it to ourselves, all right?

23:12.642 --> 23:16.450
Tell nobody. It just stays
within our circle. Marty?

23:16.550 --> 23:18.025
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.228
You just need to find someone
willing to go with you, Marty.

23:20.328 --> 23:23.431
Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah.
I think there's plenty choices right here.

23:23.531 --> 23:25.635
Some of these guys bring
some premium-grade high-test pussy.

23:25.735 --> 23:28.006
Like that little
dewy-eyed vixen right there.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.679
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.

23:30.779 --> 23:33.417
And ne of you guys messes with her,
I'm gonna crack your head wide open.

23:33.817 --> 23:37.492
- What, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
- Listen, man. That's Zoe, all right?

23:38.259 --> 23:39.329
- Zoe?
- Yeah.

23:39.629 --> 23:42.813
- Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- Yeah.

23:43.605 --> 23:46.610
I hate to say it, Phil,
but your little sister's seriously hot.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.295
- Thanks, man.
- She's not little anymore.

23:48.395 --> 23:50.952
- That is the finest piece of ass...
- Marty, that's enough.

23:51.052 --> 23:53.257
I'm just saying,
I'd like to fuck her like an animal.

23:53.357 --> 23:55.428
- Come on, Marty. That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.

23:55.528 --> 23:57.899
I want to fuck you like an animal

23:58.600 --> 24:02.368
You don't sing. You don't laugh.
You don't talk about my sister. Got it?

24:02.468 --> 24:04.716
Got it?

24:09.054 --> 24:10.792
- Don't fuck with me!
- You watch it.

24:10.892 --> 24:14.198
You watch it. Kick your ass
at your own fucking wedding.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.791
Hi.

24:26.891 --> 24:28.731
Hi.

24:29.629 --> 24:32.101
We met at the... the building opening.

24:32.201 --> 24:34.572
That's right. You're Anne Morris.

24:34.672 --> 24:36.777
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.

24:38.947 --> 24:41.285
I see you work weekends.

24:41.385 --> 24:44.125
What a dedicated personal assistant.

24:44.225 --> 24:46.212
What a lucky city councilman.

24:46.763 --> 24:48.767
Screw him.

24:48.867 --> 24:49.935
Do you?

24:54.713 --> 24:57.952
Does it get a bit boring walking around
all these parties by yourself?

24:58.652 --> 25:01.592
He wants you close, but not too close.

25:01.692 --> 25:04.733
Not when there's
important people around.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.736
I told you I fall for the wrong men.

25:08.072 --> 25:10.036
Can you keep a secret?

25:10.576 --> 25:13.342
Our city councilman
likes to keep my panties

25:13.442 --> 25:15.351
with him at these events, in his pocket.

25:16.722 --> 25:18.259
It's a turn-on for him...

25:18.359 --> 25:21.765
the thought of me in a crowd so naked.

25:21.866 --> 25:23.036
Only he knows.

25:25.540 --> 25:29.548
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?

25:29.648 --> 25:33.039
Maybe it turns me on.

25:33.139 --> 25:38.032
Maybe me telling you about it
turns me on even more.

25:44.378 --> 25:45.748
I hope you don't catch cold.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.891
Chris.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.200
Chris, I'm sorry... I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.

25:55.300 --> 25:58.012
I don't need to be tested.

25:58.506 --> 26:01.245
Listen, do you want to maybe
get a cup of coffee...

26:01.345 --> 26:04.285
someplace quiet... private?

26:27.364 --> 26:29.362
I'd like to use your key.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.774
Just once. It's not what you think.

26:32.874 --> 26:35.514
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.

26:36.615 --> 26:37.651
Have fun.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.581
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Course we do.

26:52.681 --> 26:55.263
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.

26:55.363 --> 26:59.453
To make a sixth, you'd need the code,
which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.

26:59.553 --> 27:02.124
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?

27:02.224 --> 27:04.793
What, you think we've been
givin' away our keys?

27:04.893 --> 27:07.162
- It's against your rules, Vince.
- Then show me.

27:07.262 --> 27:09.398
What are we trying to prove here?

27:09.498 --> 27:12.134
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?

27:12.234 --> 27:16.472
Let's just rule that out. Okay?
Look. Here's mine. All right?

27:21.878 --> 27:23.680
Chris?

27:24.981 --> 27:26.626
You didn't use a key to get in just now.

27:28.384 --> 27:31.121
- No. I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?

27:31.221 --> 27:33.471
I don't have it on me, okay?
It's not like I need it every day,

27:33.641 --> 27:35.281
- like some of you guys.
- But you do still have it?

27:35.381 --> 27:38.162
Vincent, whether or not I have my key
on me right now is really not important.

27:38.262 --> 27:42.136
It's extremely fuckin' important. Someone
got in using a key, and yours is missing!

27:42.236 --> 27:43.708
Is that right, Vincent?

27:43.808 --> 27:46.237
Then how do you account for the fact
that the alarm was shut off?

27:46.337 --> 27:50.475
So let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause
it definitely had to be one of us five.

27:52.642 --> 27:55.013
Unless...

27:55.713 --> 27:59.484
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in.

27:59.584 --> 28:02.053
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?

28:03.054 --> 28:05.128
Any way you look at it,
it keeps coming back down to us.

28:05.228 --> 28:07.331
And I, for one, would like to know
who's hiding something.

28:12.230 --> 28:14.029
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?

28:14.130 --> 28:17.748
Yes. Polyamory. It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system

28:17.848 --> 28:21.341
about being romantically involved
with more than one person at the same time.

28:21.441 --> 28:22.924
And your boss gets away with that?

28:23.024 --> 28:26.177
Yes. He says that he's in love
with his wife and his girlfriend,

28:26.323 --> 28:29.590
so why should he have to choose?
And his wife is amazingly cool with it.

28:29.690 --> 28:32.676
Oh, really? Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?

28:32.776 --> 28:34.987
- Explain. I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda philosophy.

28:35.127 --> 28:37.424
Barbara, what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?

28:37.524 --> 28:39.926
Please. Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.

28:40.041 --> 28:43.263
- What would you do with two?
- Bury one.

28:44.358 --> 28:46.733
I would make up something,
some sort of game

28:46.833 --> 28:50.672
that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.

28:53.907 --> 28:56.844
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?

28:57.612 --> 29:00.882
It's your party. Anyway, I'm cooking.

29:02.650 --> 29:04.251
If you absolutely have to invite
your friends over,

29:04.351 --> 29:07.430
could you at least try
to make it home on time?

29:09.524 --> 29:11.694
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?

29:15.463 --> 29:17.999
I just hope the pudgy clown
doesn't puke on the rug.

29:18.099 --> 29:22.705
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?

29:23.105 --> 29:26.075
Actually, she was just cool with it
long enough to catch him in the act.

29:26.175 --> 29:29.611
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts.

29:29.712 --> 29:31.547
Audio, video, the works.

29:31.647 --> 29:36.318
And in a heartbeat, my poor boss
went from polyamory to alimony.

29:38.654 --> 29:42.926
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what... what happened to him?

29:43.966 --> 29:47.563
He and his concubine are now cramped
in a tiny one-bedroom condo.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.199
But I'm guessing he's happy.

29:49.299 --> 29:52.863
She's blonde, 23,
with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.

29:52.963 --> 29:55.379
How can men stand fake breasts?

29:55.479 --> 29:59.210
Why are women always talking about
"fake tits" this, "fake tits" that?

29:59.310 --> 30:03.481
I mean, listen. Girls, if it's a decent
boob job, who fuckin' cares. You know?

30:03.581 --> 30:06.717
My mom... My mom,
she's got... false teeth.

30:07.118 --> 30:10.788
Okay? When she smiles, do people give her
shit and say, "Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"

30:11.289 --> 30:16.760
No, they don't. They say, "Wow! You look
way better now. It's an improvement."

30:16.860 --> 30:20.398
You know, you women,
you're so catty, so competitive.

30:20.498 --> 30:21.866
Calm down, Tubby dearest.

30:21.966 --> 30:24.636
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.

30:24.736 --> 30:27.406
I mean, a glorious,
big set of fuckin' tits...

30:27.506 --> 30:31.264
and a nice piece of ass, it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!

30:32.877 --> 30:38.184
This is all a little too highbrow
for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.

30:38.284 --> 30:40.320
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.088
And while you're under, you should have
the corners of your mouth lifted

30:43.188 --> 30:45.389
so you can smile
every once in a while. Sorry.

30:45.489 --> 30:46.900
- Sorry, Chris. What? What?
- Marty. Marty.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.547
- Come on.
- No.

30:51.765 --> 30:53.967
No, you're a class act, Marty.

30:54.267 --> 30:57.404
Mimi, would you like to get your husband
another drink or should I do the honors?

30:57.504 --> 31:00.671
You should do it. And I want it chilled.

31:00.771 --> 31:04.545
- And then you go with her and stir.
- Honey?

31:05.579 --> 31:09.183
The problem with your boss, Barbara,
is he didn't have his shit together.

31:09.283 --> 31:11.351
I mean, apart. Apart, I mean.

31:11.452 --> 31:16.223
He did... No, I mean he didn't
compartmentalize. You guys agree?

31:17.124 --> 31:20.460
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?

31:20.561 --> 31:22.463
How? Okay. Well, since you ask.

31:22.864 --> 31:26.033
First thing first is I wouldn't have
a place that you could get caught.

31:26.133 --> 31:28.937
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.

31:29.237 --> 31:31.439
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?

31:31.640 --> 31:34.475
- Am I right?
- Marty, you've lost us all.

31:36.284 --> 31:39.632
I doubt that! I doubt that, Vinnie boy.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.650
But it... Okay, first of all...
Sorry, baby.

31:41.950 --> 31:44.854
I would just get a little... you know,
a little one-bedroom condo...

31:44.954 --> 31:45.721
or something like that.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.293
You all right?

31:51.393 --> 31:54.463
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of
his ass when he's been drinking. Yeah?

32:00.970 --> 32:02.839
Hon, would you give me a hand?

32:03.339 --> 32:04.508
Sure.

32:11.815 --> 32:14.301
- Sorry. Didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.

32:14.401 --> 32:17.887
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.

32:17.988 --> 32:19.506
Yeah, it gets all up
in your nose and shit.

32:19.606 --> 32:24.595
- Yeah. It's a little spicy.
- Yeah. I'm outta here. Bye.

32:34.139 --> 32:37.409
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke?

32:37.509 --> 32:39.844
Is there something you wanna tell me?

32:39.944 --> 32:42.814
Are you keeping secrets?

32:42.914 --> 32:45.438
What kind of secrets?

32:46.451 --> 32:48.754
Is there someone else?

32:50.589 --> 32:54.893
I don't know why you start asking me
silly questions, but the answer is no.

32:55.394 --> 32:59.502
- I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
- That's not what I'm asking, Luke.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.468
I'm asking if there's someone else.

33:02.568 --> 33:05.938
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be or may not be...

33:06.038 --> 33:09.410
and I know I'm not
as glamorous as some...

33:10.743 --> 33:13.847
but I'll always be there for you
and the children.

33:16.583 --> 33:19.319
I don't know what I'd do without you.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.822
I want you to know...

33:21.922 --> 33:24.493
there's a lot I could put up with.

33:34.836 --> 33:37.572
- What are you doing?
- We need to get her out of here.

33:37.672 --> 33:40.942
- How? She is shackled to the bed!
- Can't you guys see what's going on?

33:41.042 --> 33:44.378
- Someone is trying to frame us.
- Who? Who wants to frame us?

33:44.478 --> 33:47.031
I don't know. But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.

33:47.131 --> 33:49.745
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.

33:49.845 --> 33:52.855
Someone did this for a reason.
The cops could be here any second.

33:52.955 --> 33:56.324
None of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.

33:56.725 --> 33:59.996
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?

34:00.096 --> 34:02.597
Did anyone blab, tell one of the girls
that have been up here?

34:02.698 --> 34:05.234
- Marty?
- What? Why me?

34:05.334 --> 34:08.304
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.

34:08.404 --> 34:11.005
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?

34:11.106 --> 34:13.376
Absolutely not. I just told you.

34:13.476 --> 34:15.311
Wait. What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?

34:15.411 --> 34:17.880
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?

34:17.981 --> 34:21.083
I don't know. A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.453
Betrayed husband. Someone with a motive.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.891
Look. Is one of you guys
in some kind of trouble?

35:02.761 --> 35:05.798
I think I may be
falling in love with you.

35:09.968 --> 35:12.804
You don't have to say that.

35:12.904 --> 35:15.175
No, but I mean it.

35:16.174 --> 35:20.079
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?

35:21.648 --> 35:25.585
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.

35:25.685 --> 35:29.178
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me...

35:29.989 --> 35:31.658
apart from these stolen moments.

35:31.758 --> 35:34.795
I mean, they're exciting,
yeah, sure, but...

35:36.463 --> 35:37.790
they're just moments.

35:38.164 --> 35:41.329
Let's change that. I wanna see you
more often and not just for this.

35:41.430 --> 35:44.145
No, stop it.

35:44.245 --> 35:46.796
I don't want you to love me.

35:47.241 --> 35:50.211
Well, I don't wanna
keep sneaking around.

35:51.412 --> 35:53.281
- I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
- No, you're not.

35:53.381 --> 35:56.483
Yes, I am. Anne.

35:57.785 --> 36:00.590
- I'm gonna leave her.
- Stop it!

36:01.322 --> 36:03.877
Why are you doing this?

36:05.059 --> 36:06.261
The people you love,

36:08.196 --> 36:10.499
they're the only ones who can hurt you.

36:12.668 --> 36:14.737
- I would never hurt you, Anne.
- Stop.

36:14.837 --> 36:17.122
Stop what? I don't know
what you're talking about. Would you...

36:17.222 --> 36:19.826
Stop it, okay? You don't know me.
Okay? That's the end of it.

36:19.926 --> 36:24.514
- Would you give me a chance, at least...
- I'm a whore. All right?

36:25.514 --> 36:28.451
- What?
- I'm a prostitute.

36:30.152 --> 36:32.979
I fuck men for money.

36:33.623 --> 36:35.691
Do you get it now?

36:36.292 --> 36:38.061
Don't worry, Doctor. I won't bill you
for the past few months.

36:38.161 --> 36:41.031
Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?

36:41.131 --> 36:44.435
Please stop it. You don't know
the half of it. Just go home.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.139
Go home to your wife and your kids.

36:51.582 --> 36:54.378
Is your friend Chris Vanowen
cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?

36:54.478 --> 36:57.648
Oh, I doubt that. Chris is a very
devoted husband and...

36:57.748 --> 37:00.451
And a model dad, just like
all the rest of your pals, right?

37:00.851 --> 37:04.222
Except for you. You're not exactly
squeaky clean, are you, Marty?

37:04.322 --> 37:05.523
I don't know what you mean.

37:05.623 --> 37:08.727
- Why does your wife want a divorce?
- Divorce? That's not right.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.796
What we're going through is a separation.
It's a trial separation.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.031
Why?

37:13.132 --> 37:16.135
Because she found out something
that she... wasn't too happy about.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.771
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.941
How'd she find out?

37:23.575 --> 37:27.515
- The woman with whom I...
- Fucked around?

37:27.615 --> 37:29.182
Yeah.

37:29.282 --> 37:33.586
Apparently expected something a little more
and she showed up on our front porch.

37:33.686 --> 37:37.357
The bitch started to... the woman
in question started saying things.

37:37.457 --> 37:40.186
And my only hope is that Mimi
will come around eventually,

37:40.287 --> 37:42.047
because I love her very much.

37:42.247 --> 37:43.763
Did you go with this woman
up to the loft?

37:43.863 --> 37:45.699
What? No. This happened in San Diego.

37:45.799 --> 37:48.569
Oh, that's where you met
the woman, right? In San Diego.

37:48.669 --> 37:49.903
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?

37:50.003 --> 37:52.772
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets.

37:52.872 --> 37:54.866
A VIP thing, you know. It's...

37:54.966 --> 37:57.678
a couple nights in a fancy hotel
and a chance to get away for a couple days.

37:58.178 --> 37:59.414
And nights.

38:00.481 --> 38:02.950
Yeah. Nights too.

38:03.050 --> 38:06.454
Man, do you see that? Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.

38:06.554 --> 38:10.792
Invite 'em over. You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.

38:12.326 --> 38:14.495
He's cute. See him?

38:15.096 --> 38:17.265
I'll take a rain check on that.

38:17.365 --> 38:19.868
What? What, are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?

38:20.168 --> 38:24.906
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather dive
for some rare and exotic sea creature

38:25.006 --> 38:27.409
than shoot fish in a barrel.

38:27.509 --> 38:31.013
Does Barbara know about
these deep-sea expeditions of yours?

38:31.113 --> 38:33.082
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah. What's your problem, Seacord?

38:33.182 --> 38:37.139
You got a key to the loft. What do you do
up there, your laundry? Dishes?

38:37.239 --> 38:42.124
Hey, are you guys here on business
or what? I'm Dana. My first time here.

38:42.224 --> 38:44.260
It's a little overpriced
for what you get, don't you think?

38:44.560 --> 38:49.332
Hi, Dana. I'm Vincent. This is Marty,
Luke. Can we... buy you a drink?

38:49.933 --> 38:52.319
Hey, when I said "overpriced,"
I wasn't trolling for free booze.

38:52.419 --> 38:55.005
- No, I mean, I didn't think...
- Since you asked, what are you drinking?

38:55.105 --> 38:57.507
Oh, champagne? A girl can dream.

38:57.607 --> 38:58.876
- Champagne?
- Please.

38:58.976 --> 39:01.311
All right. One champagne coming up.

39:01.411 --> 39:04.548
What are you doing? The fat chick's
gonna scare off all the hot chicks.

39:04.648 --> 39:08.185
Marty. Every fat chick
has a good-looking friend.

39:08.285 --> 39:10.154
Hers is probably
on her way down right now.

39:10.254 --> 39:12.456
Okay. Yeah, well, what if she
is the good-looking friend...

39:12.556 --> 39:15.866
and the really fat chick's
on her way down?

39:17.462 --> 39:20.181
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.

39:21.265 --> 39:23.635
- Yeah, it is.
- I'll be.

39:24.336 --> 39:27.172
That's the man of steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.

39:27.772 --> 39:30.976
- Think we should give him a key?
- Maybe. Not mine.

39:32.822 --> 39:35.914
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne
and four glasses, please,

39:36.014 --> 39:37.466
at the table in the corner.

39:37.916 --> 39:43.223
You... were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends. You're the architect.

39:44.290 --> 39:47.906
- Vincent Stevens.
- We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.

39:48.006 --> 39:50.289
Sure. What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?

39:50.389 --> 39:54.900
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive. It's cutting-edge.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.669
It might be right up your alley.

39:56.769 --> 40:00.241
Of course, it's all preliminary,
and we have to keep it under wraps.

40:00.341 --> 40:02.276
I hope you can be discreet.

40:03.476 --> 40:04.811
Sure.

40:04.911 --> 40:08.316
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.

40:08.716 --> 40:13.521
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.

40:14.021 --> 40:15.857
You are wise?

40:18.258 --> 40:22.196
Yeah, sure. Wise...
wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.

40:22.296 --> 40:25.560
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself, and wise.

40:28.102 --> 40:32.608
I'll pick up their tab as well.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.084
Fantastic.

40:42.184 --> 40:43.553
Oh, they're right over here.

40:52.795 --> 40:54.831
Sweetheart?

40:54.931 --> 40:57.801
- Sweetheart?
- Excuse me.

40:58.034 --> 41:00.964
Hi, this is Anne. Leave a message.

41:06.442 --> 41:08.134
Who are you calling at this hour?

41:12.482 --> 41:14.450
I wasn't.
I was just checkin' my voice mail.

41:14.550 --> 41:19.324
And what does your voice mail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?

41:21.458 --> 41:24.228
What are you talk... Is something wrong?

41:25.729 --> 41:28.333
You tell me, Chris.

41:32.971 --> 41:34.606
- Alison, I...
- I'm going to bed.

41:36.141 --> 41:38.177
Alison!

41:43.148 --> 41:46.523
Excuse me. That's not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.

41:46.623 --> 41:49.121
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo
month after month...

41:49.221 --> 41:50.989
One: men are pigs.

41:51.090 --> 41:53.855
Two: How do I seduce a pig
to chop my wood?

41:53.955 --> 41:56.828
I don't read Cosmo month after month.

41:56.928 --> 41:59.132
- Well, I do.
- I don't.

41:59.232 --> 42:01.267
- Well, I do.
- And I find it strangely compelling.

42:01.367 --> 42:03.061
- You know what I find strangely compelling?
- What?

42:03.162 --> 42:06.373
Your eyebrows. Lumberjack contest.

42:06.473 --> 42:08.040
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

42:08.141 --> 42:11.645
Sarah. It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.

42:11.745 --> 42:15.115
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your new friends?

42:17.351 --> 42:18.923
And that was the first time you met her?

42:20.687 --> 42:23.391
Yeah, that was...

42:23.491 --> 42:26.361
- That was the first time.
- Sarah?

42:28.261 --> 42:31.298
Yeah. Her name was Sarah.

42:31.399 --> 42:33.644
Mr. Stevens, what else happened
in San Diego?

42:34.301 --> 42:37.505
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

42:38.473 --> 42:41.291
- I got another one!
- No! No!

42:41.391 --> 42:44.278
Keep it down. Keep it down.

42:44.378 --> 42:48.283
- This is insane, Sarah.
- You should never dare a crazy woman.

42:48.383 --> 42:52.621
- Vincent, we should probably go back.
- Luke, lighten up. It's okay.

42:54.522 --> 42:57.660
Said I'd get you to the pool. Now you have
to keep your end of the bargain.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.561
- Come over here. Sit down.
- Yeah.

43:03.032 --> 43:06.329
Come on. Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.

43:07.970 --> 43:10.506
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Vince's body's not that bad.

43:10.606 --> 43:14.164
- Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
- What? Dana!

43:14.364 --> 43:17.314
Dana! Come... Come back. Come back here!

43:38.269 --> 43:41.805
- Your turn.
- No.

43:41.906 --> 43:44.620
Take it all off.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.421
Not bad.

44:27.620 --> 44:30.090
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?

44:45.839 --> 44:48.286
Are you gonna join us?

44:49.009 --> 44:50.817
I'm... I'm fine right here.

44:51.412 --> 44:54.348
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try
and make a move on me soon.

44:54.449 --> 44:57.819
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.

44:58.419 --> 45:03.125
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent would rather do laps.

45:03.525 --> 45:07.108
That would explain the last few hours
of casual-but-meaningful glances

45:07.208 --> 45:09.998
that each lasted a second too long.

45:10.198 --> 45:12.067
You like to play games?

45:12.655 --> 45:14.069
I do.

45:14.369 --> 45:18.600
And I'll tell you something else:
I'm better at it than you.

45:23.645 --> 45:27.650
- Can you feel me?
- Most definitely.

45:50.573 --> 45:52.442
Marty?

45:53.343 --> 45:57.215
- Marty, I need my room key.
- Dude! I'm kinda busy here.

45:57.315 --> 45:58.983
- Don't stop!
- Go!

45:59.283 --> 46:01.486
- I'm not stopping.
- Just do it!

46:13.365 --> 46:16.346
You're scared, is what it is.

46:17.569 --> 46:20.506
You're running away from your feelings.

46:23.709 --> 46:26.258
I don't want to say good-bye.

46:31.550 --> 46:35.088
Do you have any idea
what it's like to really love someone?

46:37.523 --> 46:39.487
I'm sorry.

47:04.084 --> 47:06.154
What are you doing?

47:08.986 --> 47:11.192
Throwing it away. It's empty.

47:11.292 --> 47:15.413
You were here yesterday, weren't you?

47:20.669 --> 47:22.393
Guys?

47:22.493 --> 47:25.223
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.

47:25.423 --> 47:27.376
First, I think Vincent
has something to tell you.

47:30.178 --> 47:32.215
All right, let's hear it.

47:35.177 --> 47:36.895
What the hell?

47:46.262 --> 47:49.309
- Hello?
- Who is it?

47:50.599 --> 47:51.836
Who is it?

47:54.370 --> 47:57.540
It's a Realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?

47:57.740 --> 48:00.247
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking...

48:00.347 --> 48:01.879
Listed the loft?

48:01.979 --> 48:05.415
She said she has an appointment
with a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.

48:06.016 --> 48:08.324
Who... Who's Sarah Deakins?

48:08.424 --> 48:11.656
Wait. Who the hell
is trying to sell our loft?

48:15.326 --> 48:17.929
You know her, Marty.

48:18.029 --> 48:21.774
- What?
- You know her, and so does Luke.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.037
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.

48:29.941 --> 48:33.922
You guys, I promise,
I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.

48:34.022 --> 48:37.216
- That's not true. You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?

48:37.316 --> 48:41.632
You met her in San Diego the last night
in the bar. Remember? Dana's friend.

48:42.855 --> 48:46.459
The last night? I was wasted
outta my mind. The whole night's a blur.

48:46.559 --> 48:48.144
Jesus!

48:48.760 --> 48:52.498
- Luke, you remember her, don't you?
- That's Sarah?

48:52.598 --> 48:54.917
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?

48:55.017 --> 48:58.405
Yes. I remember Sarah. But how
was I supposed to know that's Sarah?

48:58.505 --> 49:00.240
Come on, guys. What the hell's going on?

49:00.340 --> 49:04.230
You guys turned her over
and looked at her face. I did not.

49:08.114 --> 49:11.686
Yeah. I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.

49:12.686 --> 49:14.422
Marty. Come on!

49:19.593 --> 49:22.546
- Who is it? Do we know her?
- I don't know.

49:25.366 --> 49:26.502
Fuck.

49:30.872 --> 49:34.609
So is that all you wanted
to tell us, Vince? Or is there more?

49:37.812 --> 49:41.717
I had a thing with her.

49:41.817 --> 49:44.820
I brought her up here a couple of times.

49:45.020 --> 49:47.289
I swear on my kids,
I had nothing to do with this.

49:47.389 --> 49:49.659
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?

49:49.798 --> 49:52.172
Were you the one who let her in?

49:54.563 --> 49:56.532
I broke up with her last night.

50:08.979 --> 50:12.015
I swear she was alive when I left.

50:12.115 --> 50:14.919
It still doesn't explain
why someone listed the loft!

50:56.629 --> 51:00.066
Something special or just browsing?

51:02.835 --> 51:04.704
Why don't you return my phone calls?

51:04.804 --> 51:08.468
- If you're dumping me, at least have...
- Chris, how can I dump you?

51:09.209 --> 51:10.378
There's nothing between us.

51:13.145 --> 51:15.681
So that's what it meant to you? Nothing?

51:15.781 --> 51:18.785
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?

51:18.885 --> 51:22.970
No. I haven't. It doesn't change
how I feel about you.

51:24.758 --> 51:26.544
How many women
have you taken to that fuck pad

51:26.644 --> 51:29.480
you share with your four little buddies?

51:30.830 --> 51:32.716
- What?
- Please, Chris.

51:32.816 --> 51:34.702
Save it for some girl
who'll actually buy your bullshit.

51:34.802 --> 51:36.270
Anne, no, wait. Wait.

51:38.171 --> 51:40.409
You know I'm not like that.

51:42.544 --> 51:43.785
Here.

51:45.513 --> 51:48.518
I only need this if I'm with you,
so you keep it.

51:51.285 --> 51:53.288
If you wanna see me again,
you let me know.

51:59.861 --> 52:02.632
Chris? What are you doing here?

52:04.399 --> 52:06.635
Shopping for Alison?

52:06.735 --> 52:10.444
No. No, I was just here
with a colleague.

52:19.548 --> 52:22.185
Does your wife know you've been sharing
the loft with your pals?

52:22.285 --> 52:24.921
I already told you,
I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.

52:25.021 --> 52:28.291
I was there just once, at a party,
when the building first opened.

52:29.192 --> 52:32.620
Then you have been there. A minute ago,
you didn't even know where the building was.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.564
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.

52:34.664 --> 52:36.633
Well, did you know the girl?

52:39.436 --> 52:41.872
We met once in San Diego.

52:41.972 --> 52:45.509
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began
a relationship with her in San Diego?

52:45.609 --> 52:48.062
- That would surprise me, frankly.
- You didn't know?

52:48.162 --> 52:50.748
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?

52:50.848 --> 52:52.783
It's so obvious
what you're trying to do here.

52:52.883 --> 52:54.773
You're trying to turn us against
each other. But guess what?

52:54.873 --> 52:56.921
I'm not about to start trashing
my friend.

52:58.789 --> 53:01.727
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord,
that you are jealous of your best friend...

53:02.227 --> 53:04.129
when he's nailing
all these beautiful women?

53:04.229 --> 53:05.764
I am a married man.

53:05.864 --> 53:08.934
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.

53:09.034 --> 53:12.637
Oh, no. I didn't mean
jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.

53:12.737 --> 53:15.575
I meant jealous of the women.

53:25.218 --> 53:28.088
Where do you get off
with an innuendo like that?

53:31.658 --> 53:34.737
- Fucking bastards.
- Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?

53:34.837 --> 53:38.330
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.

53:38.430 --> 53:43.904
Yeah, fine. But your best friend is
selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.

53:44.004 --> 53:45.406
You and the rest of your gang.

53:45.506 --> 53:50.545
No. Vincent would never sell out
his friends. You're full of shit, asshole.

53:51.746 --> 53:54.449
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me, you lying piece of shit!

53:54.549 --> 53:56.523
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!

53:56.623 --> 53:58.051
Yeah?

53:58.151 --> 54:00.972
- After you cut her up with this. Right?
- Put the knife down!

54:01.072 --> 54:03.054
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.

54:03.154 --> 54:05.727
- Put the knife... Put the knife down!
- Back off.

54:05.827 --> 54:08.530
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.

54:08.630 --> 54:11.600
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.

54:12.300 --> 54:15.613
Jesus! Get a fuckin' grip!

54:16.772 --> 54:17.807
Fuck!

54:19.775 --> 54:22.111
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.

54:22.211 --> 54:25.414
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Just leave me hanging?

54:29.451 --> 54:31.755
Hey, Vince? Vince? Are you in there?

54:32.055 --> 54:34.891
If you're in there, hey, man,
I need to talk to you for just a second.

54:34.991 --> 54:37.627
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?

54:37.728 --> 54:39.964
Mimi's gone.

54:40.663 --> 54:44.053
- She's gone. Fucking gone.
- What do you mean "gone"? Gone where?

54:44.153 --> 54:46.535
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.

54:46.635 --> 54:49.439
That dumpy chick, she showed up
and then told her everything.

54:49.539 --> 54:51.100
Fuck!

54:51.200 --> 54:53.878
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?

54:53.978 --> 54:58.582
What? It's not about the goddamn loft,
Vince! It's about my wife!

54:58.682 --> 55:01.986
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her!

55:02.086 --> 55:03.988
Did you... Did you confess?

55:04.088 --> 55:06.557
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.

55:06.657 --> 55:10.295
Would you go to her and just...
just tell her that I love her?

55:10.395 --> 55:13.598
You know? And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.

55:13.698 --> 55:17.135
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you I will straighten this out.

55:17.235 --> 55:19.537
- Okay.
- Hey, come here.

55:19.637 --> 55:22.007
It's okay.

55:30.949 --> 55:32.318
Thanks.

55:32.418 --> 55:35.288
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?

55:36.222 --> 55:37.890
We get her out of here.

55:37.990 --> 55:41.894
- We can't just make a body disappear.
- That's too bad. It's our only hope.

55:41.994 --> 55:46.413
You had a relationship with her. Now she's
some inconvenient piece of evidence?

55:46.513 --> 55:49.095
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.

55:49.195 --> 55:52.406
And how do you plan to get her
off the bed? Cut off her hand?

55:53.528 --> 55:54.824
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?

55:54.924 --> 55:57.311
You know what? I thought handcuffs
were more your thing than mine, Phil.

55:57.411 --> 56:01.281
- Meaning what?
- You know exactly what I mean.

56:10.958 --> 56:14.829
Shut up! Shut up! Just keep
your fuckin' mouth shut! All right?

56:14.929 --> 56:17.397
Please help... help me! Please help me!

56:17.498 --> 56:19.558
Keep that fucking mouth shut!

56:20.414 --> 56:21.401
He's crazy!

56:21.502 --> 56:23.572
This fucking whore's
trying to rip me off!

56:23.672 --> 56:25.707
- Please help me! He raped me!
- Shut up!

56:25.807 --> 56:27.242
- Hey. Hey. Easy, easy!
- What?

56:27.342 --> 56:29.744
- All right. All right.
- It's gonna be okay.

56:29.844 --> 56:32.213
He's crazy!

56:32.313 --> 56:34.182
Shit. Okay, okay.

56:35.183 --> 56:37.820
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.487
- The keys to the handcuffs.
- She's gonna go to the cops!

56:39.668 --> 56:41.023
Keys!

56:41.123 --> 56:43.159
You want the key?

56:43.259 --> 56:46.662
- Shit.
- He made me do things I didn't want to do.

56:46.762 --> 56:48.831
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Easy. Easy.

56:49.331 --> 56:53.435
What? You want more money?
That's it, right? It's all about the money?

56:53.535 --> 56:57.174
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money! It's right there!

56:57.474 --> 56:59.810
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you?

56:59.910 --> 57:02.479
- Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's a whore, Chris!

57:02.679 --> 57:04.214
- Do you know what a whore is?
- Shut up!

57:04.314 --> 57:06.657
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!

57:06.757 --> 57:09.058
- You can't rape a...
- Shut up!

57:09.586 --> 57:12.858
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it? Not any woman!

57:16.260 --> 57:18.655
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

57:18.755 --> 57:20.965
You're putting us all at risk!

57:21.065 --> 57:23.601
I want police. He... He hit me.

57:23.701 --> 57:25.369
Shut...

57:25.705 --> 57:27.138
- He raped me!
- Shut up!

57:27.238 --> 57:30.008
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip
your goddamn throat out!

57:30.108 --> 57:33.112
I've had it with you.
You're no better than your father.

57:35.580 --> 57:37.750
- I'm what?
- You heard me.

57:38.817 --> 57:41.165
Oh, right, Chris.

57:41.265 --> 57:43.322
That's a nice one.

57:43.422 --> 57:45.691
Chris had a better deal
with his daddy, right?

57:45.891 --> 57:48.795
The great guy who wants
to save everyone.

57:49.862 --> 57:54.234
Where were you... when Zoe and I
were getting beat up?

57:55.368 --> 57:58.136
And Mom in the next room

57:58.237 --> 58:01.708
pretending not to hear. Where were you?

58:01.908 --> 58:05.927
In your cozy college dorm
getting laid and wasted

58:06.328 --> 58:08.484
- 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
- I didn't know anything about it.

58:08.584 --> 58:11.619
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!

58:11.919 --> 58:15.372
I didn't know anything about it! If you
would've told me or said something...

58:15.472 --> 58:16.990
Then what, you phony? Then what?

58:17.090 --> 58:20.795
Then I would've gotten you out of there,
goddamn it! Both of you!

58:28.470 --> 58:31.405
Listen. I'm really, really sorry,
but we can't go to the cops.

58:31.506 --> 58:33.949
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend. He's a doctor.

58:34.049 --> 58:35.443
- No.
- Yes. I'm gonna drive you to him.

58:35.743 --> 58:37.497
He's gonna take care of you. Okay?

58:38.480 --> 58:40.982
- No!
- Here. Listen.

58:41.082 --> 58:43.352
Take it. I know it's not enough
for what happened tonight, but...

58:45.186 --> 58:48.123
He's an animal. He should be locked up!

58:48.423 --> 58:50.059
And we're gonna deal with him,
I promise you.

58:52.060 --> 58:54.462
Come on. Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.

58:54.562 --> 58:56.895
- No!
- Easy. Here we go.

58:56.995 --> 58:59.051
No.

59:07.143 --> 59:11.046
I'll never forgive you for this. Never!

59:15.452 --> 59:18.051
What's the problem?

59:20.757 --> 59:24.061
Jesus Christ! Why don't I know
anything about this?

59:24.161 --> 59:27.264
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.

59:27.364 --> 59:30.367
We decided to keep it to ourselves
'cause that's the kind of friends we are.

59:30.467 --> 59:33.403
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.

59:33.803 --> 59:36.407
Yeah, yeah, right. Sorry. I meant
to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.

59:36.507 --> 59:37.474
Fuck you.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.712
You can see how I think
you'd be involved in this.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.411
I need to say something.

01:00:05.604 --> 01:00:08.041
Oh, shit.

01:00:29.563 --> 01:00:30.897
You had that coming!

01:00:30.997 --> 01:00:32.933
- Hey, come on! Get up!
- Relax. Take it easy.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.205
You son of a bitch.

01:00:34.406 --> 01:00:38.628
You recorded everything
that went on here. Every woman...

01:00:39.228 --> 01:00:43.578
Not every. Not always.
Just... sometimes.

01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:48.850
- At least I don't cheat on my wife.
- No, you just watch us and beat off.

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:51.954
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!

01:00:55.123 --> 01:00:57.275
Luke, did you record last night?

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.128
No.

01:01:00.228 --> 01:01:03.699
You didn't say you were coming,
which is against your rules.

01:01:04.199 --> 01:01:08.438
And that wasn't the first time
you broke your own rules, by the way.

01:01:09.738 --> 01:01:12.875
Now you're scared, aren't you?

01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:15.478
Now you know I've documented pretty much
everything you've been up to here.

01:01:19.315 --> 01:01:23.336
No worries, Vincent. I'll keep
my mouth shut, like I always do.

01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:28.860
Did you see anything that can help us
out here? Anything at all?

01:01:30.593 --> 01:01:35.834
If all the people who've been hurt
and cheated on find out the truth,

01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:39.270
what do you think'll happen, Vincent?

01:02:01.226 --> 01:02:03.294
What's the matter?

01:02:03.394 --> 01:02:07.532
- I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
- Serious? You love skiing.

01:02:07.632 --> 01:02:10.969
Yes, I love to ski,
but just not by myself.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.602
Are you sure you can't come?

01:02:12.702 --> 01:02:17.410
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.

01:02:18.177 --> 01:02:21.202
Hey. I'll call you every day.

01:02:22.915 --> 01:02:23.950
I love you.

01:02:34.361 --> 01:02:38.698
- I know the drill. One hour, right?
- Wrong. Have a blast. Don't mind me.

01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:40.934
Why should tonight be any different
from the past few months?

01:02:41.034 --> 01:02:44.538
Alison, if it's all right with you,
I'd rather not spoil tonight.

01:02:44.638 --> 01:02:48.409
I'm sure it must be tempting
to grab something shiny and new.

01:02:48.509 --> 01:02:51.145
But do you ever think about
what you might stand to lose, Chris?

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.781
You could ruin a lot more
than just this evening.

01:02:54.582 --> 01:02:56.585
Tell me. Are you so happy, Alison?

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:05.192
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity,

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:08.998
my mother-in-law is allowed
to join the party for a little while.

01:03:11.199 --> 01:03:13.301
Heard anything about
the waterfront project?

01:03:13.401 --> 01:03:16.037
No. He's gonna call
once he gets his permits.

01:03:16.137 --> 01:03:19.107
Now, as far as I know,
everything's approved.

01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:21.778
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:29.719 --> 01:03:33.555
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies,
you look absolutely ravishing tonight.

01:03:33.656 --> 01:03:35.424
- Thank you.
- This is Vincent Stevens.

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:38.828
He's the architect who designed
the new loft building near the sports arena.

01:03:38.928 --> 01:03:40.797
Oh, wonderful. I love that building.

01:03:40.897 --> 01:03:43.233
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.

01:03:44.034 --> 01:03:46.737
As I was saying to your husband
in San Diego,

01:03:47.437 --> 01:03:51.508
gentlemen in our business
can't afford to be exposed

01:03:51.608 --> 01:03:53.911
to the negative consequences
of bad design.

01:03:54.411 --> 01:03:58.548
Speaking of... San Diego, how's that
waterfront project coming along?

01:03:58.849 --> 01:04:01.452
Yes. We're still working on it.

01:04:01.552 --> 01:04:03.654
We've applied for all our permits
and now we're waiting.

01:04:03.754 --> 01:04:05.990
Standing in line like everyone else.

01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:11.079
You don't strike me as the type of man
that stands in line, Mr. Fry.

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:14.231
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?

01:04:14.331 --> 01:04:16.901
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?

01:04:17.002 --> 01:04:22.040
As a matter of fact, I do. Especially
when I'm holding a handful of hearts.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.798
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.

01:04:23.898 --> 01:04:26.778
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables
tonight as you are in love,

01:04:26.878 --> 01:04:30.949
then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

01:04:57.344 --> 01:04:58.248
Blackjack!

01:04:59.746 --> 01:05:03.483
- Set aside enough for the "ali-money."
- Mimi, what are you doin' here?

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:05.511
Just 'cause I booted you out
doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.

01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:09.289
I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once. Once.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.394
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.

01:05:12.494 --> 01:05:16.130
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.533
- I promise I'll change.
- Into what? A frog?

01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:21.101
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass you already are?

01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:24.239
What if I told you I wanted
to fuck around tonight? Sorry.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.325
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.

01:05:27.826 --> 01:05:30.613
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris. He's cute.

01:05:30.713 --> 01:05:34.215
Or how about Vincent? The night you sent him
over for that tragic heart-to-heart.

01:05:34.315 --> 01:05:37.274
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."

01:05:38.419 --> 01:05:40.088
Blackjack!

01:05:40.188 --> 01:05:42.908
Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.

01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:46.429
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.

01:05:52.969 --> 01:05:55.071
I love you!

01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:57.506
- You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
- Philip, let go.

01:05:57.606 --> 01:05:59.843
I keep her away from bullshit like this,
and then behind my back...

01:05:59.943 --> 01:06:02.579
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?

01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:05.148
Did you see her? She looks like a whore.

01:06:05.548 --> 01:06:08.207
- I thought you like whores.
- Yeah.

01:06:08.307 --> 01:06:09.720
Let her have some fun.
If you'll excuse me

01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:11.621
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.

01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:12.689
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:14.111
I hope you win big-time.

01:06:14.211 --> 01:06:17.527
You'll need it with all the shit
you've been packin' up your nostrils.

01:06:17.627 --> 01:06:20.465
So you noticed a tiny fraction
of your stash went missing?

01:06:20.765 --> 01:06:22.786
If you don't like it,
file for a divorce.

01:06:22.887 --> 01:06:26.470
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.

01:06:26.704 --> 01:06:28.236
While you're at it
go play some blackjack.

01:06:28.336 --> 01:06:31.209
Could be your last best chance
at paying the rent.

01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:33.812
Can I get some dice over here?

01:06:37.348 --> 01:06:38.617
- Hands off.
- Excuse me.

01:07:12.885 --> 01:07:14.589
Anne?

01:07:16.256 --> 01:07:18.125
Anne?

01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:22.876
We need to talk.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:25.999
Yeah? About what?

01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:28.736
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.

01:07:30.304 --> 01:07:32.774
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:43.752
I'll pass along your message to Vincent,
but I'd like something too, Mr. Kotkin.

01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:47.823
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.

01:07:47.923 --> 01:07:51.160
- And why would I do that?
- Because I love her.

01:07:52.628 --> 01:07:54.630
Then we have more in common
than we thought.

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.766
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.

01:07:56.866 --> 01:08:00.603
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.

01:08:00.803 --> 01:08:03.502
Except I never paid for her.

01:08:03.603 --> 01:08:05.322
Well, that's true.

01:08:05.422 --> 01:08:07.243
You never paid.

01:08:07.543 --> 01:08:09.600
Stop it, Joel.

01:08:13.182 --> 01:08:15.268
I'm going.

01:08:17.917 --> 01:08:20.066
What did he mean by that...
"You never paid"?

01:08:20.166 --> 01:08:22.959
- I don't want to love you, Chris.
- Someone's paying you to be with me?

01:08:23.158 --> 01:08:25.863
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
- Anne?

01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:28.232
Tell me it's a lie.

01:08:30.433 --> 01:08:33.420
The first time, it was paid for.

01:08:33.904 --> 01:08:35.973
Every other time,
that was real, that was me.

01:08:36.786 --> 01:08:39.810
- But who paid?
- I can't...

01:08:52.157 --> 01:08:54.993
- Excuse me. Come on, Zoe, let's go.
- I'm fine here.

01:08:55.193 --> 01:08:58.095
- I'm asking you to come with me.
- And I'm asking you to stop.

01:08:58.196 --> 01:08:59.897
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.

01:09:00.198 --> 01:09:03.903
- Stop!
- What are you deaf or just a dick?

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.939
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?

01:09:07.038 --> 01:09:09.408
"Deaf" or "dick"? Help me out.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:13.060
Stop! Leave him alone! Don't! Don't!

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.318
Fuck! Come on!

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:20.019
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

01:09:20.617 --> 01:09:24.392
- Shut up!
- Somebody get this guy an ambulance.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.094
I never want to see you again.

01:09:28.194 --> 01:09:32.131
Not in my home and not near
my daughter. Do you got that?

01:09:32.232 --> 01:09:34.702
Get him the hell out of here.

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:37.772
Okay, folks! Let's get back
to the gaming tables, shall we?

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:43.314
Hey. It's okay.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:52.921
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.

01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:03.598
- It's not what you're thinking.
- And what am I thinking?

01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:05.834
She's my friend's sister. Okay?

01:10:06.034 --> 01:10:10.967
Are there more besides me, her
and your wife? What's the grand total?

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.410
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.

01:10:16.124 --> 01:10:18.260
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.951
- I'm crazy about you.
- But would you choose me if you could?

01:10:23.204 --> 01:10:25.658
You know it's not that simple.

01:10:25.758 --> 01:10:29.727
Come meet me in the loft tomorrow,
okay, and we'll talk it through.

01:10:30.592 --> 01:10:33.230
You're right. It's not that simple.

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.700
- But maybe I can make it simple.
- What do you mean?

01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:40.771
Maybe I can help you make that choice.

01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:43.145
Sarah.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.746
Sarah.

01:10:54.151 --> 01:10:56.280
Sarah.

01:10:58.556 --> 01:11:00.181
Sarah.

01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:05.297
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

01:11:05.397 --> 01:11:07.866
Don't do it, Sarah. You'll regret it.

01:11:35.995 --> 01:11:38.510
They found out.

01:11:42.101 --> 01:11:44.838
Our wives, they... they set us up.

01:11:44.938 --> 01:11:46.440
Why, Vincent?

01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:49.377
They...

01:11:49.477 --> 01:11:52.612
They found out.
They found out about the loft.

01:11:52.712 --> 01:11:55.383
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.

01:11:57.518 --> 01:12:00.597
- No.
- Why did you do it?

01:12:03.257 --> 01:12:04.225
No.

01:12:04.325 --> 01:12:07.361
It was... our wives.
They... They found out.

01:12:07.462 --> 01:12:10.899
No, it's your friends. We found out.

01:12:15.837 --> 01:12:19.127
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.

01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:29.781
- All right, strip him.
- What are you doing?

01:12:29.881 --> 01:12:32.888
- You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.

01:12:32.988 --> 01:12:35.442
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
- That wasn't a part of the plan.

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:38.260
And the Latin on the bed? Like the cops
are gonna believe that bullshit.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.715
- Then you should've done it yourself.
- Come on. Let's do this.

01:12:41.664 --> 01:12:45.568
- What'd you give me?
- What you deserve.

01:12:51.852 --> 01:12:53.676
You...

01:12:54.077 --> 01:12:55.880
You killed Sarah?

01:12:57.147 --> 01:13:00.717
- No. We just found her.
- What?

01:13:01.018 --> 01:13:04.488
We were here this morning, Vincent,
before you arrived.

01:13:06.356 --> 01:13:08.393
No.

01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:22.424
Jesus Christ.

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:25.577
At first I thought she was sleeping.

01:13:25.677 --> 01:13:27.913
And Vincent knows her?

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:32.885
She... She left him this.

01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:39.525
"See you in the next life."

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:44.597
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.

01:13:44.897 --> 01:13:47.274
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.

01:13:47.374 --> 01:13:52.004
Guys, wait. Can't we find out where
she lives and... and leave her there?

01:13:52.104 --> 01:13:53.173
- Jesus.
- Philip.

01:13:53.273 --> 01:13:55.341
- Come on, we have to help out Vince.
- Yes. Speaking of which,

01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:58.111
where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?

01:14:01.147 --> 01:14:04.785
Vincent isn't here because...
because I didn't call him.

01:14:04.885 --> 01:14:06.921
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?

01:14:08.522 --> 01:14:10.417
There's something I have to show you.

01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:16.464
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!

01:14:16.564 --> 01:14:18.298
You can beat the crap out of me later.

01:14:18.799 --> 01:14:22.137
We don't have much time,
and you need to watch this.

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:26.274
Maybe you'll get a new perspective
on what happened upstairs.

01:14:26.374 --> 01:14:31.113
Maybe you'll agree we shouldn't
take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.

01:14:33.682 --> 01:14:35.249
You see, Vincent...

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:38.915
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.

01:14:58.374 --> 01:14:59.743
No.

01:15:00.143 --> 01:15:01.683
Oh, God!

01:15:03.146 --> 01:15:04.480
Hey, maybe I already got even.

01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:08.985
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him
over for that tragic heart-to-heart.

01:15:09.185 --> 01:15:11.588
They got here late,
the night he went to talk to her.

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.661
She was drunk, Marty. He took advantage.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:34.951
Wow. Your little sister's seriously hot.

01:15:38.183 --> 01:15:39.417
Hey.

01:15:39.817 --> 01:15:41.119
- How long has it been...
- Doesn't matter.

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.301
How long?

01:15:45.057 --> 01:15:49.296
He started seeing her right after your
wedding. They met here on a regular basis.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.566
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.

01:15:54.966 --> 01:15:56.836
Fuck!

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:12.696
Gorgeous?

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:17.324
The people you love,
they're the only ones who can hurt you.

01:16:26.667 --> 01:16:28.636
He paid Anne...

01:16:29.036 --> 01:16:31.204
to let you seduce her,

01:16:31.304 --> 01:16:34.107
put the hook in
so you'd want a share of the loft.

01:16:34.207 --> 01:16:36.109
The first time, it was paid for.

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:38.090
Have fun.

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:41.957
Chris, please. You don't know
the half of it. All right? Just go home.

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:47.222
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.

01:16:48.824 --> 01:16:50.559
Everyone.

01:17:07.877 --> 01:17:09.645
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

01:17:09.745 --> 01:17:14.213
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he
walks in. We have to try and remain calm.

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:15.985
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.

01:17:16.085 --> 01:17:18.889
That's why we can never admit
we're sharing this loft.

01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:21.058
They'll try to turn us
against each other.

01:17:22.793 --> 01:17:26.597
Okay. I think this can work
as long as we follow the plan.

01:17:27.664 --> 01:17:29.467
Chris?

01:17:31.501 --> 01:17:33.670
Okay. I'm in.

01:17:33.971 --> 01:17:36.373
But only if we know for sure
that Vincent was here last night.

01:17:36.473 --> 01:17:40.978
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.

01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:45.850
I'll give a signal...
break something, a glass.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:50.389
But nothing happens until we know
for sure. Understood?

01:17:52.656 --> 01:17:55.860
We've got just under two hours
to set everything up and establish alibis.

01:17:55.961 --> 01:18:01.033
I'll take care of it. You guys get out
of here. Make sure people see you.

01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:03.769
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.

01:18:03.869 --> 01:18:07.706
You knew what that prick was up to
and you never said anything.

01:18:07.806 --> 01:18:09.835
You're just as sick as Vincent.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:27.707
They met here on a regular basis.

01:18:40.574 --> 01:18:43.611
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:00.195
He started seeing her
right after your wedding.

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:23.153
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.296
You are a total fucking psychopath.

01:19:33.396 --> 01:19:35.766
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!

01:19:35.866 --> 01:19:37.602
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?

01:19:37.703 --> 01:19:39.421
Like the cops are gonna
believe that bullshit.

01:19:44.374 --> 01:19:45.877
What happened here?

01:19:47.344 --> 01:19:49.504
You're framing me!

01:19:53.316 --> 01:19:56.653
Swallow it. Swallow. Swallow.

01:19:57.454 --> 01:19:59.324
My own friends.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.063
My own friends!

01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:22.348
- Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.

01:20:23.349 --> 01:20:25.450
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:29.055
Then she killed herself, with you
by her side. "Fate will unite us."

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:32.646
But you're gonna survive.

01:20:33.893 --> 01:20:35.329
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?

01:20:50.877 --> 01:20:52.680
So, you see, it was a setup.

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.417
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.

01:20:56.517 --> 01:20:58.519
Still sounds a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?

01:20:58.619 --> 01:21:00.521
- Unbelievable? But it's the truth.
- Yeah.

01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:03.975
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth,
and you prove it with facts and findings.

01:21:04.075 --> 01:21:07.328
Fact is, we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.997
Yeah, because they wiped
the place clean.

01:21:10.197 --> 01:21:13.968
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual
exploits with your prints all over them.

01:21:14.068 --> 01:21:16.805
Luke made those DVDs. I never even
saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:19.374
Yeah, but we got no DVDs
of your friends.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:23.111
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:27.082
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend. All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:30.920
And we got no evidence
that you were being set up.

01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:34.156
All right. Is there anything
we've forgotten?

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:37.226
Yeah. To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.976
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason to mutilate her.

01:21:40.076 --> 01:21:42.698
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:45.402
Yeah, well, you better hope
your dramatics don't put us in jail.

01:21:55.379 --> 01:21:59.449
Look, just... lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break. Maybe Luke too.

01:21:59.549 --> 01:22:01.541
Look, don't tell me how to do my work.

01:22:01.641 --> 01:22:04.354
We've questioned them all. I got no reason
to believe they've been lying.

01:22:04.554 --> 01:22:08.275
- Plus, all your friends have alibis.
- Alibis? Not for this morning, they don't.

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:11.879
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen
together at breakfast.

01:22:11.979 --> 01:22:14.469
We got Marty Landry at his office.
All right?

01:22:14.569 --> 01:22:19.571
At his office? Look, for at least an hour
this morning, we were all in the loft.

01:22:19.671 --> 01:22:21.472
So was Phil. What about Phil?

01:22:21.572 --> 01:22:24.375
Actually, he's downstairs right now
with his father-in-law.

01:22:24.475 --> 01:22:26.577
Fry? What the fuck's Fry doing here?

01:22:26.677 --> 01:22:29.847
He just gave a statement saying
that he was with his son-in-law all day.

01:22:30.148 --> 01:22:32.184
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!

01:22:32.284 --> 01:22:35.243
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.

01:22:35.343 --> 01:22:40.359
Credibili... I saw Fry in San Diego
with some bimbo! Okay?

01:22:40.459 --> 01:22:44.496
Phil knew that. He knew I pressured Fry
into giving me a waterfront contract.

01:22:44.796 --> 01:22:46.966
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?

01:22:49.269 --> 01:22:50.903
Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.

01:22:51.003 --> 01:22:53.939
We got your prints all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.

01:22:54.039 --> 01:22:56.710
We got you chained next
to the dead girl on the bed. All right?

01:22:56.810 --> 01:23:00.648
Call your lawyer, make a confession
and save your ass!

01:23:12.192 --> 01:23:14.995
You're free to go. I want
to thank you for your cooperation.

01:23:15.095 --> 01:23:17.665
You understand we had
to check out your friend's story.

01:23:17.965 --> 01:23:20.435
Of course. It's your job.

01:23:24.748 --> 01:23:26.747
There's just...

01:23:27.241 --> 01:23:28.910
one thing that's bothering me.

01:23:30.912 --> 01:23:34.149
Why does Vincent Stevens
keep accusing his best friends?

01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:40.656
I... I don't know. It bothers me too.

01:23:42.924 --> 01:23:46.494
Could it be... I just...
I just wonder...

01:23:46.595 --> 01:23:48.163
Do you think he's trying
to hide something else?

01:23:50.867 --> 01:23:54.503
- What would he be hiding?
- Sarah Deakins's murder.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:57.941
Murder?

01:24:00.176 --> 01:24:03.246
But the detective in the interrogation
called it a suicide.

01:24:03.346 --> 01:24:04.658
Well, that's what it looked like.

01:24:04.758 --> 01:24:08.105
But the autopsy report revealed
that sleeping pills didn't kill her.

01:24:08.205 --> 01:24:11.154
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.

01:24:11.254 --> 01:24:14.124
Hesitation marks,
those tentative attempts...

01:24:14.224 --> 01:24:16.692
the first ones before a suicide
actually slashes through an artery...

01:24:16.793 --> 01:24:18.195
The coroner didn't find those on her.

01:24:20.798 --> 01:24:24.168
- But Vincent, he... he would never...
- His prints are on the knife.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.175
We didn't find a suicide note.

01:24:36.548 --> 01:24:37.864
Is there something wrong?

01:25:32.773 --> 01:25:35.343
We didn't find a suicide note.

01:25:35.943 --> 01:25:39.481
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.

01:26:16.585 --> 01:26:18.354
Luke.

01:26:19.255 --> 01:26:21.726
Chris. You scared me.

01:26:24.494 --> 01:26:28.833
- You sure it's smart meeting here?
- I think we have a problem, Luke.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.570
- How so?
- Where's Sarah's suicide note?

01:26:34.972 --> 01:26:35.873
You put it in your pocket.

01:26:35.973 --> 01:26:39.097
Yeah, I could've sworn I did,
but it's not there anymore.

01:26:39.197 --> 01:26:41.545
So when did you steal it from my coat?

01:26:42.246 --> 01:26:44.957
When the doorbell rang this morning?

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.411
Surprise visit from the Realtor?

01:26:48.586 --> 01:26:50.821
Chris, it's...

01:26:50.922 --> 01:26:54.758
it's unfortunate that you lost
Sarah's suicide note, but...

01:26:54.858 --> 01:26:57.095
I had nothing to do with that.

01:26:57.195 --> 01:27:01.233
I called the agency to ask
who put our loft up for sale.

01:27:01.433 --> 01:27:03.903
All they could give me was a number.

01:27:18.451 --> 01:27:21.459
I did call them. I wanted...

01:27:21.954 --> 01:27:24.489
I thought maybe that...

01:27:32.933 --> 01:27:37.003
It's over, Chris. We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about now.

01:27:37.204 --> 01:27:38.639
But why'd that note disappear?

01:27:40.357 --> 01:27:42.310
The only real proof of her suicide.

01:28:01.095 --> 01:28:02.097
Hello?

01:28:02.197 --> 01:28:04.331
She says she's got an appointment
with someone named Sarah Deakins.

01:28:04.432 --> 01:28:06.268
Who's Sarah Deakins?

01:28:17.646 --> 01:28:20.850
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.

01:28:21.984 --> 01:28:23.886
Vincent fucked us all. You saw.

01:28:23.986 --> 01:28:27.089
Yeah, I saw. All the DVDs
that made everybody crazy

01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:29.726
went right along
with your grand plan, didn't it?

01:28:29.826 --> 01:28:33.330
But why, Luke?
What'd you do to that girl?

01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:37.635
Did she get in your way,
between you and Vincent?

01:28:39.569 --> 01:28:41.939
Actually, it was Vincent...

01:28:42.105 --> 01:28:44.442
standing between us.

01:28:56.653 --> 01:28:57.755
Is there someone else?

01:29:01.325 --> 01:29:03.895
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.

01:29:12.237 --> 01:29:14.572
Sarah, wait!

01:29:14.672 --> 01:29:17.613
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.

01:29:17.713 --> 01:29:20.246
Always was, always will be.

01:29:21.279 --> 01:29:22.615
He's hurting you.

01:29:23.315 --> 01:29:26.585
- Using you.
- Why are you telling me this?

01:29:26.685 --> 01:29:30.371
I'm telling you because...
because I'd never hurt you.

01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:34.486
If you'd just give me the chance...

01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:36.196
to show I'd never hurt you.

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.668
That's right. You'd never hurt me,
because I feel nothing for you, Luke.

01:29:46.539 --> 01:29:48.637
I'm sorry.

01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:52.758
Maybe in another life.

01:30:11.399 --> 01:30:13.938
You were here last night.

01:30:14.635 --> 01:30:16.985
Barbara was off skiing.

01:30:17.085 --> 01:30:20.241
So I figured I'd find
Vincent here, with Sarah.

01:30:20.742 --> 01:30:23.054
I'm sorry.

01:30:28.751 --> 01:30:30.854
I waited till he left.

01:30:35.224 --> 01:30:36.993
She said I was right about Vincent.

01:30:43.465 --> 01:30:46.704
Consoling. I've gotten so good at it.

01:31:11.128 --> 01:31:15.867
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's... quick, painless...

01:31:16.467 --> 01:31:18.502
leaves no trace.

01:31:18.602 --> 01:31:20.305
Jesus, Luke.

01:31:24.376 --> 01:31:27.779
I did it out of love. I swear.

01:31:30.449 --> 01:31:33.499
And Vincent taking the fall for this...

01:31:33.818 --> 01:31:35.394
That's okay with you?

01:31:36.277 --> 01:31:39.358
Vincent used everyone and anyone!

01:31:39.458 --> 01:31:42.495
It's about time we turned the tables!

01:31:42.902 --> 01:31:45.646
Well, he's being charged with murder.

01:31:46.132 --> 01:31:49.802
Yeah. Sarah wasn't dead
when we left her with Philip.

01:31:51.237 --> 01:31:53.783
No. No, you're lying.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.953
No.

01:31:56.053 --> 01:31:57.411
That's not possible.

01:32:07.587 --> 01:32:11.758
What Philip did to her... was sick!

01:32:12.359 --> 01:32:13.561
You're sick, Luke.

01:32:14.994 --> 01:32:18.265
But if I'm hearing you right,

01:32:18.865 --> 01:32:22.103
it was your brother who killed Sarah.

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:32.413
Okay, Chris. Go home.

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.615
I'll clean up.

01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:36.085
Like always.

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:39.221
No.

01:32:40.456 --> 01:32:42.224
No more cleaning up, Luke.

01:32:51.534 --> 01:32:53.035
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.

01:32:53.335 --> 01:32:54.631
Now.

01:32:57.574 --> 01:32:59.610
Jesus. Let me help you, Luke. Please!

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.314
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.

01:33:06.883 --> 01:33:09.986
- What do you want me to do? Jump?
- Yes. If you don't mind.

01:33:10.086 --> 01:33:11.621
Luke, you don't need to do this.

01:33:11.722 --> 01:33:13.957
Jesus Christ, Luke! Would you stop it!

01:33:14.557 --> 01:33:17.361
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.

01:33:17.862 --> 01:33:20.932
So just do it. Now!

01:33:25.602 --> 01:33:29.372
I called the cops before I came.
I told 'em everything.

01:33:29.506 --> 01:33:33.195
- Bullshit. I know you better.
- I thought I knew you.

01:33:39.084 --> 01:33:42.754
What about the note?
You want this to go down with me too?

01:33:44.056 --> 01:33:45.908
Give me that note, Chris.

01:33:46.008 --> 01:33:48.061
Give it to me!

01:34:23.597 --> 01:34:24.731
It's over, Luke.

01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:31.706
You're right.

01:34:32.506 --> 01:34:33.608
It is over.

01:34:42.816 --> 01:34:45.353
Tell Ellie and the kids...

01:34:46.487 --> 01:34:48.506
I'm sorry.

01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:51.600
Would you do that for me, Chris?

01:34:52.127 --> 01:34:55.309
- No.
- Come on, Chris. Be a friend.

01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:58.600
Luke? Luke. Luke!

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.483
Luke!

01:35:50.188 --> 01:35:52.423
- They're married.
- Honey, no. They're having an affair.

01:35:52.523 --> 01:35:54.226
Why? Because she's laughing
at his jokes?

01:35:54.326 --> 01:35:56.895
No. I'm telling you,
they're having an affair.

01:35:56.995 --> 01:35:59.697
Since when are you
the big expert on affairs?

01:35:59.797 --> 01:36:01.299
Really?

01:36:01.399 --> 01:36:04.236
- Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
- What was my alternative?

01:36:04.336 --> 01:36:07.457
To leave you wailing at the front door,
with snot pouring out of your nose?

01:36:09.241 --> 01:36:10.809
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you off.

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:12.911
I have the kids early tomorrow,
so I gotta go.

01:36:13.012 --> 01:36:15.422
You're gonna leave me here
alone with my wife?

01:36:15.522 --> 01:36:17.216
- Yes.
- We could at least have one more drink.

01:36:17.616 --> 01:36:18.984
There'll be plenty more drinks.

01:36:19.085 --> 01:36:22.090
- Good night, Meems.
- Good night, Chris.

01:36:39.473 --> 01:36:41.488
Chris.

01:36:43.643 --> 01:36:46.146
- Anne.
- Hi.

01:36:46.747 --> 01:36:48.253
Hi.

01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:54.155
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

01:36:55.723 --> 01:36:59.661
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?

01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:04.765
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone now.

01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:07.135
It's the only thing
his wife let him keep.

01:37:08.904 --> 01:37:13.116
- And... And Philip?
- He's awaiting trial, so...

01:37:13.717 --> 01:37:15.210
we'll see.

01:37:15.944 --> 01:37:18.013
And you?

01:37:18.714 --> 01:37:20.954
Are you doing okay?

01:37:21.684 --> 01:37:25.454
- Yeah. Most of the time.
- And the rest of the time?

01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:30.861
I heard you ditched the city councilman.

01:37:32.428 --> 01:37:34.999
That's not all I've given up.

01:37:37.074 --> 01:37:39.169
Do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or...
