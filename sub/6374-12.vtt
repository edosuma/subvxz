WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.060
Previously on "ugly betty"...

00:01.070 --> 00:03.510
It's just that we have so
little time left together.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.950
I want us to have memories.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.530
You have a secret husband?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.430
I haven't seen stuart for five years.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.910
Is this bradford meade's body?

00:10.920 --> 00:13.710
If I can't marry into the meade family,

00:14.430 --> 00:17.420
I will give birth to an heir.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.520
Medically speaking,you
can't carry a child.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.770
We need to find a
surrogate we can control.

00:21.780 --> 00:22.980
Christina mckinney...

00:22.990 --> 00:26.540
Her husband's sick,her insurance
doesn't cover him,and she's desperate.

00:26.550 --> 00:29.340
Why would fey have
pictures of me in her safe?

00:29.350 --> 00:31.380
Fey sommers was your mother.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.620
I know who killed fey
sommers. It was me.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.280
And I may be gone for very long time.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.930
You ju really seemed to up
your game when betty showed up.

00:38.940 --> 00:39.600
What?

00:39.610 --> 00:42.320
I don't think I'm the
suarez sister you like.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.450
Where am i?

00:54.260 --> 00:55.830
What happened?

00:55.840 --> 00:57.590
We're trying to figure that out,ma'am.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.190
You passed out in gio's deli.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.310
- Come on.
- Gio.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.130
Apparently you threw a
trash can through the window.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.110
What?

01:03.120 --> 01:04.410
I wouldn't do that.

01:07.510 --> 01:08.770
Oh,my god.

01:11.460 --> 01:12.670
Lose the cuffs officer.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.030
I won't be pressing any charges.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.240
No,no,no,no,gio.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.100
If-- if I did something illegal,then
I'm prepared to face the consequences.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.470
What would I be looking at,officer?

01:21.480 --> 01:26.100
Breaking and entering,criminal
trespassing,vandalism-- Say five years.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.190
- Help.
- Yeah,okay.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.060
We're good here.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.610
Gio,I would never throw a trash can.

01:33.620 --> 01:38.770
Once,uh,I-in school,tommy deluca-- He
threw a-a butter pat on the ceiling,

01:38.780 --> 01:40.640
and I was the one who told the teacher.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.910
Actually,ofcer,if-- if you knew
me,this would be really funny.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.910
Crime isn't funny.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.360
Oh,no,I-I di-- I didn't
mean that crime was funny.

01:51.370 --> 01:56.730
I just-- I just meant that this
situation,with me and-- And-- and handcuffs...

01:56.740 --> 01:57.820
Okay,okay.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.810
I don't understand.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.640
I'm so not mysellately.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.780
{\a6}3 DAYS EARLIER

02:11.820 --> 02:13.940
And on the seventh day,they rested...

02:13.950 --> 02:16.910
The prosecution,that is,in
the claire meade murder trial.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.360
She's pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity,for the murder of fey sommers,

02:21.370 --> 02:23.670
but as you can see from
this artists' rendering,

02:23.680 --> 02:27.320
the dior suit she had on yesterday
had mecrazy with jealousy.

02:27.330 --> 02:31.860
The outfit gave alethalinjection of style
to an otherwise drab day of testimony,

02:31.870 --> 02:33.230
but things should pick
up today with the--

02:33.240 --> 02:36.770
All righty. We got some more
suits in for your testimony.

02:36.780 --> 02:40.950
Valentino sent this,dolce
& gabbana sent this,

02:41.260 --> 02:43.200
and ozwald boateng sent this.

02:43.210 --> 02:45.060
I
- I think that one's too boxy.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.870
Hey,what about this?

02:47.880 --> 02:49.060
That'll make my eyes pop,huh?

02:49.070 --> 02:51.320
Daniel,forget about boxy.

02:51.330 --> 02:56.380
This is your mother's murder trial,not
tobey maguire's birthday party at bungalow 8.

02:56.390 --> 02:59.820
You need to appear
conservative and trustworthy.

02:59.830 --> 03:00.580
Betty's right.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.270
We're the face of our mother's defense.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.870
The jury needs to see
us as just plain folk.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.300
Said the amazon transsexual.

03:08.290 --> 03:10.210
Betty,my mother needs
some things from her place.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.250
Can you please pick 'em up and
bring 'em to the courthouse?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.000
Of course.

03:13.010 --> 03:16.360
Her mon atelier suit,matching
pumps-- Oh,and this perfume she loves.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.410
It's on her dressing table.

03:17.420 --> 03:19.160
All right. No problem.

03:19.170 --> 03:20.460
I'll go right now.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.820
I can't believe we're doing this today.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.870
Guys,don't worry.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.520
You're gonna be great.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.540
You're really gonna
help your mom's case.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.400
What if we don't?

03:34.030 --> 03:35.810
You want a what?

03:35.820 --> 03:36.970
A baby.

03:36.980 --> 03:40.240
You know,tiny and soft with
a face like a little old man?

03:40.250 --> 03:42.690
And you want me to carry it in my womb?

03:42.700 --> 03:46.760
Well,we would ask for your purse,but we don't
want a baby that grew in a gucci knockoff.

03:47.050 --> 03:48.320
Shortbread,love?

03:48.330 --> 03:50.870
Oh,my god. He's--
he's not-- not the...

03:51.730 --> 03:54.120
No,no.

03:54.130 --> 03:57.060
Though we would make a good one--
Her evil disposition,my eyes...

03:57.070 --> 03:59.930
- That kid would be unstoppable.
- no.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.190
It's an anonymous donor.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.890
Marc has been such a good friend since I
made the decision to have another child.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.180
And since I decided
to leave "mode"--

04:07.190 --> 04:08.900
You were fired.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.290
You're right. I was fired.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.750
So why do you need me?
Why don't you just do it?

04:12.760 --> 04:17.190
Well,according to my doctor,my
eggs are fine,but,um...

04:19.420 --> 04:22.220
I can't carry the baby.

04:22.230 --> 04:23.650
It's tragic.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.070
Bono and sheryl crow should do a
benefit concert for her lady parts.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.150
Well,sorry.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.720
Look,think of it as giving
up your body for nine months--

04:30.730 --> 04:32.570
Strictly a financial agreement,

04:32.580 --> 04:37.540
and I'd offer you $100,000.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.180
What would I do with $100,000?

04:40.190 --> 04:44.610
I don't know,maybe purchase an
experimental surgery for someone... I love.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.370
You know all about stuart.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.110
Evil is all-knowing.

04:52.940 --> 04:56.540
Well,thank you very much,both
of you,for your kind ofr,

04:56.550 --> 05:00.940
but my uterus is officially
closed to devil spawn.

05:06.210 --> 05:10.130
Wilhelmina's having a baby,and
she wants you to carry it for her?

05:10.140 --> 05:12.950
Yeah,and she was gonna
pay me 100 grand to do it.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.270
Which would pay for stuart's operation.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.770
Thankfully,though I don't
need to carry the demon seed,

05:17.780 --> 05:19.390
'cause I've got another
way to get the money.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.980
Oh,you do?

05:21.270 --> 05:26.700
A couple of weeks ago,I was archiving
some gowns,and I came across this.

05:27.090 --> 05:31.710
Now jackie kennedy wore it to a
state dinner at the white house.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.200
Oh,my god.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.120
This must be
worth,like--

05:37.130 --> 05:39.570
$100,000 on the black market.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.830
Oh,now,betty,I know
what you're thinking.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.110
It's just a piece of cloth.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.540
Christina,that's stealing.

05:45.550 --> 05:48.060
But it could save stuart's life.

05:48.730 --> 05:51.690
Well,when you put it that way...

06:04.910 --> 06:07.230
excuse me,who the hell are you?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.320
Oh,the cafeteria was packed.

06:09.330 --> 06:12.440
You're gettingalad dressing
on my mother's ottoman.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.990
How do you even know about this place?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.120
Everody knows.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.520
You think you can keep this a secret?

06:16.530 --> 06:18.650
Man,I need to catch a 5-minute nap.

06:18.660 --> 06:19.590
Who the hell are you?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.030
I'm tired.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.370
Wait. Wait,those
sheets are chinese silk.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.010
People...

06:26.020 --> 06:29.610
This was my late mother fey
sommers' secret sex room.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.930
It was designed for lazy afternoons that
blurred the line between pleasure and pain.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.820
It is not a place for salads or naps.

06:35.830 --> 06:36.450
That's it.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.590
I'm getting her stuff out of here.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.660
All of thi belonged to my mother,

06:41.670 --> 06:45.850
who,I like to think,had multiple
orgasms right where you're sitting.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.740
That's right. She was that kind of lady.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.580
Good-bye.

07:12.310 --> 07:14.800
Oh,my god.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.450
Diary pages?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.920
"february 26,2006.

07:24.930 --> 07:29.750
"back from our scandinavian trip,"where
I never left bradford's arms. "

07:29.760 --> 07:35.190
it was a taste of what life could be like
"if that annoying shrew claire wasn't around.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.110
It gives me an idea..."

07:42.910 --> 07:46.390
And you brought my perfume.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.630
Oh,when I would wear this,I
would feel so special.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.350
You know,your father brought
this back for me from denmark.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.310
He would love when I wore this.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.800
I Miss him so much.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.490
Mom,you have to pull it together.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.320
What's the use?

08:02.330 --> 08:03.470
I'm going away forever.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.020
Mom,no.

08:05.030 --> 08:07.940
You were not in your right mind
at the time of the accident.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.110
Your lawyer's going to prove it.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.830
I'm sorry. I can't allow the peume.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.790
Come on,please.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.790
Daniel,it's all right.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.140
This is my life now.

08:14.150 --> 08:15.670
I used to plan garden parties.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.790
Now I get a flashlight
in my tush every morning.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.480
I'll live.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.170
Betty?

08:25.590 --> 08:29.080
- I want you to take this.
- Okay.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.690
Yeah,i'll hold on to it.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.390
No,I want you to have it. Come here.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.030
Now you're in love with that nervous
little fellow with the glasses.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.679
I want you to wear
it and spoil yourself.

08:39.690 --> 08:44.890
Uh,no,m-mrs. Meade,it's--
it's too fancy,and it's yours,

08:44.900 --> 08:48.680
and-- and daniel and alexis are
right,youaregonna get out of here,

08:48.690 --> 08:50.090
and then you're gonna need it again,

08:50.100 --> 08:54.410
so-- so I'lljust-- I'll
just keep it safe for you.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.110
Thank you.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.380
My mother raised us with a
strong sense of right and wrong.

09:06.390 --> 09:09.420
She was clearly not in her right
mind at the time of fey's accident.

09:09.430 --> 09:13.000
Ms. Meade,you seem like you
were very close to your mother.

09:13.010 --> 09:17.390
Can you describe her state of mind in
the days leading up to the accident?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.870
Um,I didn't hear anything.
Do you hear anything?

09:20.880 --> 09:23.550
I didn't hear anything.
I'm sorry.Louder?

09:24.050 --> 09:26.770
I
- I wasn't in contact with my mother at that time.

09:26.780 --> 09:31.960
Right,right,because you had liedto
your family about a skiing accident

09:31.970 --> 09:34.920
in order to cover up your
secret sex change operation.

09:34.930 --> 09:38.170
Is this an example of the strong sense
of right and wrong your mother taught you?

09:38.180 --> 09:39.580
Objection.

09:39.590 --> 09:43.880
Ms. Meade made a very difficult
personal decision to become a woman--

09:44.320 --> 09:47.480
A very attractive woman--
But that is no reflection on--

09:47.490 --> 09:49.740
Her mother's ability to
commit premeditated murder?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.060
That's enough,counsel.

09:51.070 --> 09:55.850
Ms. Meade's personal
choices are not on trial.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.780
I just know my mother would
never kill anyone,ever!

10:01.790 --> 10:04.960
Obviously there was
something wrong with her.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.160
"march 15th...

10:17.170 --> 10:22.480
"i innocently suggested to bradford "he give
claire a little gift to cover up our trip--

10:22.490 --> 10:25.640
A bottle of perfume from denmark."

10:25.650 --> 10:28.830
That doesn't belong to you,betty. Focus.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.670
"she's so easily seduced by
silly tokens of his affection.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.980
"april 4,2006.

10:39.990 --> 10:43.400
"oh,claire,it's too delicious.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.360
"i changed the ingredients.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.760
"it's toxic.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.440
"it's seeping into her brain.

10:48.450 --> 10:52.700
"she's poisoning herself with
her own frivolous vanity."

11:05.610 --> 11:08.640
"and soon enough,she'll be dead."

Wow,you smell great.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.870
I mean,not that you don't
always smell good. You do.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.780
I could just sniff you all day,but...

11:37.790 --> 11:39.650
God,whatever you got on now...

11:39.980 --> 11:41.200
You like it? It's Mrs. Meade's.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.650
It's like 200 bucks an ounce.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.150
Oh,preston.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.370
You're really on fire there.

11:47.380 --> 11:48.460
I know. I-I don't know what it is.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.960
I have so much energy.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.660
Oh,are those the estimates for daniel?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.080
He's in court all day,but I'll have him sign
them, and I'll get them right back to you.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.100
Oh,actually,you should
get them to kenny.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.640
I'm gonna be out of the office tomorrow.

11:56.650 --> 11:57.690
- You are?
- Yeah.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.580
I have that... Thing in tucson.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.100
Right. Uh,charlie's
sonogram.I totally forgot.

12:02.110 --> 12:04.440
Oh,but I did make you this
care package for the plane.

12:04.450 --> 12:07.630
I got you crossword puzzles-- Your
favorite-- and this little neck thingy.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.730
You really do have a lot of energy.

12:10.510 --> 12:12.520
Oh,you smell so good.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.400
You gotta keep using that perfume.

12:14.410 --> 12:15.670
Oh,randy!

12:15.680 --> 12:17.070
There you are!

12:17.080 --> 12:18.420
Oh,careful!

12:18.960 --> 12:20.430
Sorry!

12:24.330 --> 12:26.430
I really think we got lucky
with this judge heller.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.250
Shseems to be on mom's side.

12:28.260 --> 12:32.380
Well,finally something that went our way,because
I totally blew it up there this morning.

12:32.390 --> 12:33.530
You're crazy.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.100
I was watching the jury.
They were eati it up.

12:36.110 --> 12:39.940
Hey,you did a great job of making
mom seem like a real person.

12:39.950 --> 12:42.440
- Can anyone break a $20?
- Yes.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.700
Here you go.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.580
Hi,judge heller. How are you?

12:52.410 --> 12:54.090
Pandemonium in the court.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.150
The claire meade murder trial
erupted into fireworks today

12:57.160 --> 12:59.530
as the prosecution
accused daniel meade...

12:59.540 --> 13:02.500
Bribing judge nora heller.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.300
Daniel.

13:04.310 --> 13:07.270
Judge heller,who has seemed
very pro-defense in recent days,

13:07.280 --> 13:09.580
immediately recused
herself from the case.

13:09.590 --> 13:10.860
No.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.240
No,no,no,no,no. What?

13:13.490 --> 13:15.930
Come on. Daniel.

13:17.610 --> 13:18.940
Itchy.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.990
Hi,pretty perfume.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.260
You smell so pretty.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.640
Got your 'wiches.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.110
Industry term.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.390
Thank you.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.090
Thank you.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.130
So why two?

13:53.140 --> 13:58.820
Because one is for me,and one
is for henry's care package.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.090
He's going out of town.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.710
Egg salad.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.100
I should've guessed. It travels well.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.840
So where is eggy heading to,anyway?

14:05.850 --> 14:06.560
Tucson.

14:06.570 --> 14:08.250
His baby's sonogram.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.130
This is really good.

14:13.140 --> 14:16.750
The flavors in pastrami taste like...

14:16.760 --> 14:20.270
Like... Like purple.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.000
Right.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.840
Well,don't worry.

14:24.850 --> 14:27.440
Whatever happens in
tucson stays in tucson.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.570
What is that supposed to mean?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.770
These tomatoes are really good.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.340
They're like sunshine.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.270
We're eating sunshine.

14:38.090 --> 14:41.980
But come on,the guy is gonna go down there
to go and see his ex-girlfriend,but relax.

14:41.990 --> 14:45.110
It's not like he's gonna
get her pregnant again.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.580
That's disgusting.

14:46.590 --> 14:47.820
He would never cheat on me.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.710
Yeah,you're right.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.100
It's not eggy's style.

14:51.110 --> 14:52.320
His name is not eggy.

14:52.330 --> 14:54.560
It's egg salad.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.560
Betty,are you okay?

14:57.570 --> 15:00.290
No. It's henry.It's henry.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.950
Is it really hot in here?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.340
'cause I'm sweating.

15:03.350 --> 15:09.090
You know,for what it's
rth,you smell really good.

15:09.940 --> 15:11.980
You smell really good,too.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.570
Look,I told you I wasn't
trying to bribe judge heller.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.560
I was just making change.

15:18.570 --> 15:21.080
Big shot had to show
everyone he could break a $20.

15:21.090 --> 15:23.050
Daniel,it's all right.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.250
How screwed are we?

15:24.260 --> 15:24.950
Ah,we're fine.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.800
I've never lost a case,Mrs.
Meade,and I don't intend to start now.

15:28.810 --> 15:29.960
Okay,I gotta be honest with you.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.450
I have lost one case,in
2006,and it just kills me that

15:33.460 --> 15:36.930
I can't say I've never
lost a case anymore.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.410
What's the matter?

15:42.420 --> 15:45.000
Remember that one case that I lost?

15:45.010 --> 15:45.990
That's the judge.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.480
Ladies and gentlemen,good afternoon.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.650
I am judge nancy biotch.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.660
You've got to be kidding.

15:51.670 --> 15:53.790
And she lives up to it.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.200
I'm the new presiding
judge in this case.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.070
I was supposed to be on my
way to the bahamas in an hour.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.020
Instead I'm here.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.380
Lucky me.

16:03.390 --> 16:08.140
Oh,Mr. Meade,should you get itchy to buy
another officer of the court a coffee,

16:08.150 --> 16:10.750
i'd love a grande soy latte.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.120
Laugh.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.800
So where are you gonna be sleeping?

16:20.810 --> 16:22.470
Are you staying with charlie?

16:22.480 --> 16:24.470
Because,you know,I don't care.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.890
You know what? Don't even tell me.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.630
You can sleep with whoever you want.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.750
Betty,no. Of course not.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.680
I would never do
anything like that--

16:30.690 --> 16:31.730
darn right you wouldn't.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.620
Now promise you'll call me tonight.

16:33.630 --> 16:34.210
Okay.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.840
Oh,but don't call me at home.

16:35.850 --> 16:37.020
Use the bat phone.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.400
I don't want my dad listening in
because I don't know what I might say.

16:40.410 --> 16:42.750
Ava! What's up?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.230
That's ava. She's new in production.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.380
We could be best friends.

16:45.390 --> 16:46.850
I like her. I like you.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.000
Oh,my god.

16:49.010 --> 16:50.830
Look at those colors.

16:50.840 --> 16:55.200
Oh,they're so... Intense.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.390
I never noticed that before.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.210
I'm sorry. Betty.Betty?

16:59.220 --> 17:00.580
Are you okay?

17:00.590 --> 17:03.510
You're acting a little
hyper,and-- and you're sweating.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.130
No,I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.690
I'm great! You know why?

17:06.700 --> 17:12.319
Because I have the best,most
loyal boyfriend in the whole world.

17:13.970 --> 17:15.210
Okay. Good-bye.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.500
- I love you.
- Okay.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.109
Oh,did you have that care package?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.470
Got your care package right here!

17:23.859 --> 17:24.569
Betty.

17:30.070 --> 17:31.520
I love you,too.

17:37.060 --> 17:39.400
Well,look who went from
flirty to dirty-- oh.

17:39.410 --> 17:40.170
I don't care.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.310
It felt good,and if it feels good,do it.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.510
Weird. Is there,like,a echo in here?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.140
Hello!

17:49.630 --> 17:50.720
Can you believe this?

17:50.730 --> 17:52.350
Fey poisoned the perfume.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.560
And bradford didn't know?

17:53.570 --> 17:55.640
No. He gave it to claire as a gift.

17:55.650 --> 17:59.570
It was supposed to kill her,but claire went
nuts and ended up killing my mother first.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.940
Oh,my god. These pages
would exonerate claire meade.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.990
They totally make her
look like the victim.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.150
You're right.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.710
Give it.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.420
Mandy.

18:12.430 --> 18:15.330
I'm not gonna let my dead
mother look like some psycho.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.300
Halston,get back here.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.810
Okay,marc,you have to finish this.

18:22.820 --> 18:25.800
And when I get back,you're gonna
tell me what exonerate means.

18:25.810 --> 18:27.800
- Mandy,wait.
- Halston!Wait.

18:27.810 --> 18:30.390
Security is gonna take you away again.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.160
Oh,man,I didn't sleep at all last night.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.580
I stayed up waiting for henry to call.

18:53.590 --> 18:57.050
He never called,but I got to
see this molly ringwald marathon.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.680
She is amazing.

18:58.690 --> 19:00.560
"pretty in pink," "sixteen candles"...

19:00.570 --> 19:02.050
- "breakfast club."
- "breakfast club"--

19:02.060 --> 19:03.070
I love that movie.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.180
- How did she not win an oscar?
- I know.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.440
You didn't sleep at all?

19:06.850 --> 19:08.220
Are you feeling okay?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.890
I mean,yeah. That's what's so weird.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.610
I'm-- I'm
not sleepy.

19:11.620 --> 19:15.200
I'm just-- I'm itchy,and I'm a little
tingly,and my mouth is really dry.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.270
- Whose juice is this?
- That's mine.

19:19.810 --> 19:20.780
What's for breakfast?

19:20.790 --> 19:22.860
Huevos rancheros,but a
little different today.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.280
I'm trying a new recipe.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.930
That's gross. What else is there?

19:25.940 --> 19:28.410
Betty,papiworked really hard on that.

19:28.690 --> 19:31.670
Oh,whatevs. I'll just see
what I can get at the office.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.820
How about this?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.830
That should hold me over.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.110
All right,gang.
A- b-c ya.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.490
A-
b-c ya.

19:49.910 --> 19:51.350
What the hell is wrong with her?

19:51.360 --> 19:52.780
I don't know,but I like it.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.410
She's sassy.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.370
Mr. Meade,you admit that at
the time of fey sommers' murder,

19:57.380 --> 19:59.600
your mother was drinking heavily.

19:59.610 --> 20:02.280
Yes,but at the time,my father
was openly involved with--

20:02.290 --> 20:03.110
Carrying on an affair.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.980
Yes,it's sad,but legal.

20:04.990 --> 20:07.690
What's not legal is murdering
your husband's lover.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.830
Look,obviously my
mother wasn't all there.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.040
She was terribly upset.

20:11.050 --> 20:13.900
Yes,so upset that she arranged
to have fey sommers' brakes cut.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.620
Objection.Spec--

20:15.630 --> 20:18.030
I'll allow it. Proceed.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.260
Okay.

20:19.270 --> 20:20.690
You're not understanding me.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.110
Okay,the night before fey'saccident,

20:23.120 --> 20:25.580
my mother and I went to
orso's before the theater to--

20:25.590 --> 20:27.680
Oh,my god!Dinner before the theater.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.240
She must have been insane.

20:30.220 --> 20:33.680
What were some of the other warning
signs of her supposed insanity,huh?

20:33.690 --> 20:34.690
Red wine with fish?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.680
No,I just mean,she wasn't herself.

20:36.690 --> 20:37.790
She was paranoid.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.350
She was behaving irrationally.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.210
She was seeing things
that weren't even there.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.340
So what you're telling me,Mr. Meade,is
that your mother went to a broadway show,

20:44.350 --> 20:46.980
justhoursafter paying
someone to kill her rival.

20:46.990 --> 20:51.340
Does that sound insane to you,or
cold,calculating and premeditated?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.620
I got nothing.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.140
well,sing a song for sing singo

20:58.150 --> 21:02.390
it was a disaster this afternoon for
the defense as prosecutor ogden weitz,

21:02.400 --> 21:05.650
in a crisp,classic 2
- button suit and cavalli loafers,

21:05.660 --> 21:10.270
made hay with poor daniel meade,who
made a rare fashion misstep.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.990
Windsor knot with a spread collar?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.290
You're the one who should be
behind bars,danny boy. J'accuse.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.520
Henry...

21:20.360 --> 21:21.370
Call.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.270
Call.

21:28.450 --> 21:29.720
Call.

21:38.970 --> 21:40.370
Calm down,betty.

21:40.380 --> 21:41.990
Henry loves you.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.020
Hey,betty.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.560
I don't need it right now,gio.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.280
No,no,no,look.

21:46.650 --> 21:50.990
I've been thinking about it,and
I just-- I want to apologize.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.970
I should have never said that egg salad
was gonna do anything wrong in tucson,

21:54.980 --> 22:00.250
and I know you don't like it,so I'm not
gonna call him egg salad anymore,okay?

22:00.690 --> 22:01.690
It's henry.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.880
Your boyfriend henry.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.130
Thank you.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.920
So hashenrychecked in?

22:08.930 --> 22:10.890
What? Why?

22:10.900 --> 22:12.550
- You okay?
- Yes.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.000
I'm fine.

22:14.010 --> 22:14.950
Has he called?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.550
No. No.No.

22:16.560 --> 22:22.450
Henry hasn't called,and that's probably because
he's been very,very busy with his sonogram.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.310
Yeah. Yeah,you're probably right.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.130
"you're probably right"?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.690
"you're probably right"?
What does that mean?

22:30.700 --> 22:31.920
What are you trying to
say? What are you saying?

22:31.930 --> 22:34.400
That because henry hasn't called,he's
probably sleeping with charlie?

22:34.410 --> 22:35.750
Is that what you're trying to say?

22:35.760 --> 22:37.680
No,betty. That's not
what I'm trying to say.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.640
You know what,gio?

22:39.650 --> 22:42.340
I am sick of you coming
up here to torture me.

22:42.350 --> 22:46.150
I don't need it. So
justo and don't come back!

23:05.390 --> 23:09.680
She wants to sell a vintage couture gown
that jackie kennedy wore at the white house?

23:09.690 --> 23:10.610
I know. So stupid.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.870
You can't just secretly
auction off a vintage dress.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.550
She's never gonna sell
it. That's what I say.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.720
She'll have a buyer in
ten minutes. It's genius.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.220
Exactly. Her an is perfect.

23:19.230 --> 23:21.210
You know what we have to do,marc?

23:21.530 --> 23:24.310
Bid on it and then
take turns wearing it.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.220
No,sweetheart. Not this time.

23:26.610 --> 23:28.870
We have to make it disaear.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.690
I need christina to carry that baby
i'm making with bradford's sperm.

23:32.700 --> 23:36.450
Without the dress,she might
be more open to my offer.

23:39.410 --> 23:43.790
*****can you believe that
gio would actually say that?

23:43.800 --> 23:47.550
I mean, imply that henry
would cheat on me with charlie?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.930
What a jerk!

23:48.940 --> 23:51.580
Yeah, I just came to see
if you had any petty cash.

23:51.590 --> 23:56.090
It's like everything he does--
everything he says-- it just bugs me--

23:56.100 --> 24:01.100
gets under my skin, you
know he just bugs me so much.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.090
Here.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.360
Is it hot in here? I'm sweating.

24:04.370 --> 24:06.230
Ooh, sparkly.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.000
Watch it, cheese fingers.

24:08.010 --> 24:12.190
You know, the only reason gio talks to you
like that is because he has a crush on you.

24:12.870 --> 24:13.910
No. He does not.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.690
I watch how he looks at you...

24:15.700 --> 24:16.410
when I'm really bored.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.750
Why? How does he look at me?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.400
It's just in that certain way.

24:19.410 --> 24:23.920
I saw it with every single guy I
knew growing up and their fathers...

24:23.930 --> 24:25.290
and some of their mothers.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.720
Well, I do not have a crush on gio.

24:26.730 --> 24:30.460
I only have a crush on henry--
my perfect, handsome boyfriend,

24:30.470 --> 24:33.860
who has not called me in 12 hours.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.000
What's that?

24:38.010 --> 24:39.880
Perfume. Claire meade gave it to me.

24:39.890 --> 24:43.810
Henry likes the way it smells,
so I wear it to remind me of him.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.360
You know what?

24:45.370 --> 24:48.730
I don't care if gio likes
me, because I don't like him,

24:48.740 --> 24:52.590
and I'm gonna tell him to leave
me alone in a strongly worded note.

24:52.860 --> 24:55.680
"Dear gio"...

24:55.690 --> 24:59.290
"I hate that name
'cause I don't like you.

24:59.300 --> 25:03.410
You are not my friend."

25:03.990 --> 25:05.620
Gio.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.010
Betty.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.630
Gio.

25:10.870 --> 25:14.340
Gio, I have something for you. Gio.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.450
I have something for you.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.680
Don't ignore me. Open
this door right now.

25:19.690 --> 25:21.500
This is so stupid. Don't ignore me.

25:21.510 --> 25:22.670
Gio!

25:22.680 --> 25:25.790
I need to talk to you. I
need to talk to you right now!

25:29.380 --> 25:30.610
Gio!

25:33.240 --> 25:34.850
betty? Betty?

25:34.860 --> 25:37.900
What happened? Where am I?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.340
oh, god.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.700
I have the biggest headache,
and my palms e all sweaty.

25:48.890 --> 25:51.760
Well, you'll see the doctor, and
you'll find out what's going on.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.070
You sure you don't want
me to call your family?

25:53.080 --> 25:55.200
No, no,
just--no.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.130
They'll worry too much.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.640
betty. Oh, my god.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.060
are you okay?

26:01.070 --> 26:03.360
I came as soon as I heard.

26:04.010 --> 26:05.890
What? How did you know I was here?

26:05.900 --> 26:07.070
It's dr. Squassi.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.280
His receptionist tina used to
go out with santos' friend tino.

26:10.290 --> 26:11.300
Tina and tino, I know.

26:11.310 --> 26:14.450
Anyway, she called me as soon
as she saw you were brought in.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.510
Hi, gio.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.920
Fine, I just-- I
hope you didn't tell--

26:19.530 --> 26:21.180
I can't*********

26:21.190 --> 26:22.360
Are you ok?

26:22.840 --> 26:24.970
******** thank you.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.950
Guys, I'm fine.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.120
You are not fine. Look at me.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.800
Yestday at breakfast, I knew, and
I can see in your eyes right now...

26:33.810 --> 26:35.940
you're not yourself.

26:35.950 --> 26:38.420
You look scared.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.180
Okay, now we have to do this very quickly,
because you shouldn't really be in here.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.260
I just need to see it.

26:44.270 --> 26:48.700
If it's in the condition you say it
is, I'll cut you a check right here.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.140
Oh, it's in mint condition.

26:51.150 --> 26:54.900
Mm, it been boxed ansealed
in acid-free tissue paper.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.910
Oh, it's-- it's
extraordinary.

26:56.920 --> 27:00.320
It's like a window into a bygone era.

27:01.190 --> 27:02.770
oh, my god.

27:04.060 --> 27:06.760
a dress that was shredded?

27:06.770 --> 27:08.860
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.120
Marc?

27:10.130 --> 27:13.700
Oh, I just got a new crock-pot,
so you know where I was all day.

27:13.710 --> 27:15.780
How could you?

27:15.790 --> 27:18.970
I needed that money.
This is my husband's life.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.890
Oh, I know. It's terrible.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.710
Well, lucky for you, you
have more than one option.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.150
But why me?

27:26.160 --> 27:29.770
I mean, there's--there's thousands-- there's
millions of other women in this city--

27:29.780 --> 27:31.870
because I want you, christina.

27:31.880 --> 27:36.190
I need to know my partner in this
is someone I know and can trust.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.310
I've lost everything.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.150
This child is my entire life.

27:41.160 --> 27:46.650
Think of our future-- for you and
your husband, for me and my baby.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.380
and marc.

27:53.090 --> 27:55.710
Ah, you remember
my antonio--my baby?

27:58.460 --> 28:00.240
he's a sophomore at cornell.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.620
He's studying mechanical engineering.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.440
They grow up so fast, eh, ignacio?

28:04.450 --> 28:05.550
Too fast.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.520
Oh, my, my, my.

28:06.530 --> 28:08.960
Uh, I-I think betty and
i need to speak privately.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.910
Ay, dios míO. She's pregnant.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.840
Here we go again. Just like your sister.

28:12.850 --> 28:13.350
Dad!

28:13.360 --> 28:14.620
Oh, no, no, no. That's not it.

28:14.630 --> 28:18.120
Betty, is there something that
you need to talk to me about?

28:19.150 --> 28:20.440
Well, what do you mean?

28:20.450 --> 28:24.180
Well, your symptoms indicate high
levels of toxins in your body.

28:24.190 --> 28:25.840
Drugs?

28:25.850 --> 28:27.610
What? No.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.660
Wait. No.

28:28.670 --> 28:29.640
That's impossible.

28:29.650 --> 28:31.300
Well, you said you haven't
been yourself lately.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.840
You're jittery, anxious,
overly emotional?

28:33.850 --> 28:35.180
You did break in to my deli.

28:35.190 --> 28:36.150
- Shut up.
- What?

28:36.160 --> 28:37.900
Your pupils are dilated.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.250
Your glands are swollen.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.290
Your heart rate is above normal.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.050
Dr. Squassi, this is me.

28:44.060 --> 28:46.630
I don't do drugs.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.600
I'm afraid of espresso.

28:48.610 --> 28:53.050
well, if you're not taking
drugs, someone is drugging you.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.570
betty, I'm on my way.

28:56.580 --> 28:59.620
No, henry, you don't
have to come home early.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.180
I'm fine.

29:01.190 --> 29:04.190
Just hearing your voice is enough.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.630
I love you, too.

29:08.630 --> 29:11.160
soon as the blood work comes
back, we'll know what's going on.

29:11.170 --> 29:12.710
Oh, my god, would you listen to this?

29:12.720 --> 29:15.180
I could so be on an episode
of "grey's anatomy" right now.

29:15.190 --> 29:16.950
- I miss addison so much.
- I know.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.600
Why'd she have to go do that
"private practice" thing?

29:18.610 --> 29:20.100
I don't know.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.350
Okay, well, we have the, uh, report in.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.230
You have high levels of
methyldexetrin in your system,

29:26.240 --> 29:28.320
and lower levels of
linbin and fitzadent--

29:28.330 --> 29:32.930
and--and this is very strange--
uh, traces of bufo alvarius.

29:32.940 --> 29:33.790
Bufo what?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.740
It's toad venom.

29:35.750 --> 29:36.750
oh, snap, betty.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.610
Your levels are almost normal now,
and you won't have any more effects,

29:39.620 --> 29:43.030
but you're a very lucky young lady
that we found this out in time.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.800
- Too much of it in
your system- - what?

29:44.810 --> 29:47.710
Well, it--it could lead to
hallucinations and paranoia.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.780
Enough of it, it could be fatal.

29:49.790 --> 29:50.750
think, betty.

29:50.760 --> 29:54.440
Is there anything you've done, anything
you've eaten differently in the last few days?

29:54.450 --> 29:56.900
No.
No.I-I-haven'T.

29:56.910 --> 30:03.020
I--just-- just the food at home, and
I did have one of gio's sandwiches.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.830
My sandwiches are all natural.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.140
Wait.

30:11.580 --> 30:15.120
Doctor, is it possible to get drugged
by something that got on my skin?

30:15.130 --> 30:16.700
Why?

30:20.020 --> 30:21.040
excuse me!

30:29.990 --> 30:32.360
Oh, god. Where'd it go?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.520
Oh, god.

30:35.060 --> 30:37.580
Betty, betty, betty,
where did you put it?

30:39.610 --> 30:40.860
oh, god.

30:44.030 --> 30:45.650
Sparkly.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.820
amanda.

30:49.790 --> 30:51.220
You took my perfume.

30:51.230 --> 30:52.310
- No, I didn'T.
- Yes, you did.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.320
- Did not.
- Did, too.

30:53.330 --> 30:54.320
Okay, fine. I took it.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.800
But so what? It wasn't even yours.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.410
Amanda, that perfume is evidence.

30:57.420 --> 31:00.760
It could prove that mrs. Meade was insane,
and it wasn't yours, so just give it back.

31:00.770 --> 31:04.580
Um, actually, it was my mother's, who
gave it to bradford, who gave it to claire.

31:04.590 --> 31:06.030
I read it in her diary.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.970
Wait. What?

31:07.980 --> 31:10.130
You mean, fey was
trying to poison claire?

31:11.700 --> 31:14.580
But claire went nuts, and
she killed my mother first.

31:14.590 --> 31:17.400
Oh, my god, we have to get the
perfume to court and say that.

31:17.410 --> 31:18.820
No way.

31:18.830 --> 31:21.760
Claire took my mother's
life, and now I'm taking hers.

31:21.770 --> 31:23.940
Amanda, she wasn't herself.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.740
This bores me.

31:25.750 --> 31:26.800
Well, forget about me.

31:26.810 --> 31:27.730
Think about daniel.

31:27.740 --> 31:30.130
You care about him, don't you?

31:30.750 --> 31:32.430
Amanda.

31:32.440 --> 31:36.610
His mother is going to jail for
something that she would have never done.

31:36.920 --> 31:41.540
You really want to be responsible for daniel
losing his mother for the rest of his life?

31:41.550 --> 31:44.710
Amanda, look, I know you're
hurting 'cause your mom is gone.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.840
Trust me, I know what that feels like.

31:46.850 --> 31:50.300
But if I could keep one person
from feeling that, I would.

31:50.310 --> 31:53.990
Amanda, just give me the perfume.

32:01.340 --> 32:03.160
- are you out of your mind?
- No.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.520
Daniel, this stuff is poison.

32:05.530 --> 32:09.540
It seeped into my bloodstream and
it made me do all these cry things.

32:09.550 --> 32:10.660
Oh, my god.

32:10.670 --> 32:11.990
Like your poor hair.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.730
No. That's mine.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.840
And I also have my
blood test to prove it.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.740
Do you think that's possible?

32:18.540 --> 32:20.130
I-I-I was acting
so erratic.

32:20.140 --> 32:23.090
I just assumed it was the
stress and the drinking.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.440
No, it wasn't, mrs.
Meade. It wasn't you.

32:25.450 --> 32:28.350
It was this stuff--
this perfume.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.220
What do you think?

32:29.230 --> 32:30.540
Is that really her hair?

32:30.550 --> 32:31.650
yes.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.980
Well, oh.

32:33.450 --> 32:37.450
Well, it's worth a shot. Here,
let me see the blood test.

32:37.460 --> 32:41.320
Your honor, the defense would like
to call betty suarez to the stand.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.990
And I only did those things

32:47.000 --> 32:52.400
because I had been spraying myself
with this perfume for the last two days.

32:52.410 --> 32:55.510
Mrs. Meade used it for six months.

32:57.740 --> 32:59.170
Makes sense to me.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.400
Thank you, ms. Suarez.
No further questions.

33:01.410 --> 33:03.820
Prosecution, your witness.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.190
Ms. Suarez...

33:11.200 --> 33:14.820
why would bradfordeade give
his wife poison perfume?

33:14.830 --> 33:15.950
Um, well, no.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.400
I-I don't think that mr.
Meade knew that it was poison.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.730
Uh, fey sommers wrote in her
diary that she gave it to bradford

33:23.740 --> 33:26.060
so that he would give it to claire.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.550
Ah, and where's this
mysterious diary now?

33:29.560 --> 33:32.370
Um, I-I don't know.

33:32.380 --> 33:33.660
I don't-- I
don't have it.

33:33.670 --> 33:38.310
Oh, and maybe you're just being
a good assistant to mr. Meade,

33:38.320 --> 33:42.050
and maybe this perfume
isn't poison at all.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.320
No. No, I'm not a good assistant.

33:44.330 --> 33:47.040
I mean--I mean,
it-- this is poison.

33:47.050 --> 33:50.720
I know because dr. Squassi,
my family doctor, said so.

33:50.730 --> 33:53.190
Ah, well, you might wanna get
yourself a new family doctor,

33:53.200 --> 33:57.260
because in just the last few minutes, the
prosecution has had this perfume tested.

33:57.270 --> 33:59.260
I don't think you want to do that.

34:05.590 --> 34:08.250
call 9-1-1. I told
you not to do that!

34:08.610 --> 34:10.550
oh, that's refreshing!

34:11.179 --> 34:12.489
because guess what?

34:12.500 --> 34:16.710
This so-called "poison
perfume" is actually just water!

34:18.620 --> 34:19.530
settle down.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.670
Straight from the tap.

34:20.679 --> 34:21.730
That's impossible.

34:21.739 --> 34:22.820
It has a scent.

34:22.830 --> 34:25.000
my boyfriend said he loved it.

34:25.010 --> 34:26.920
Smells like water to me.

34:26.929 --> 34:30.489
Thank you, ms. Suarez.

34:33.350 --> 34:35.489
I don't understand.

34:36.790 --> 34:39.330
This--this is
the perfume.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.520
Like I'd give her the perfume.

34:41.530 --> 34:44.920
Claire meade, you will
never see the light of day.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.710
I'm sorry.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.630
I'm so sorry.

34:56.639 --> 34:59.040
I-I really don't know what happened.

34:59.050 --> 35:01.810
I-I swear, this perfume was real.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.380
It's okay, betty. It didn't hurt us.

35:03.390 --> 35:04.730
He's right.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.330
Thank you, betty.

35:06.340 --> 35:08.020
I know how hard you tried.

35:08.030 --> 35:08.880
I'm sorry.

35:08.890 --> 35:12.320
It's time I stood up there
and gave my side of the story.

35:16.690 --> 35:18.790
Mandy, I can't deal with
anymore wickedness today.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.920
I-I got to go.

35:19.930 --> 35:22.040
I spend more time here now
than when I worked here.

35:22.050 --> 35:23.230
Marc, come on.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.790
What is wrong with you?

35:24.800 --> 35:25.980
We'll just go to the west side,

35:25.990 --> 35:28.750
and we'll throw it in the river,
and after, we can cruise the bars.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.050
Why do I have to go with you?

35:30.060 --> 35:32.140
Because you're a part of this, remember?

35:32.150 --> 35:33.830
You burned those diary pages.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.820
Ok, I do a lot of morally
questionable things for wilhelmina,

35:36.830 --> 35:40.320
but none of it is technically criminal,
and it's all in service of my career.

35:40.650 --> 35:42.390
Oh, and suddenly, you don't work for me?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.260
Actually, I never did.

35:43.270 --> 35:44.470
No, when you first got to "mode"?

35:44.480 --> 35:45.370
You were the receptionist.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.140
Yeah, and after that?

35:46.150 --> 35:47.010
You were still the receptionist.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.380
I was never a tiny bit higher than you?

35:48.390 --> 35:49.430
Not for one minute.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.200
Marc, just do it, okay?

35:52.210 --> 35:53.590
Get rid of it.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.170
Claire meade has to pay.

35:55.180 --> 35:56.640
- Why?
- What?

35:56.650 --> 35:58.380
Why does claire meade have to pay?

35:58.390 --> 36:02.550
She didn't do anything wrong, except for
use some perfume that her husband gave her.

36:03.050 --> 36:05.550
I can't do it, mandy. I'm sorry.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.860
And you wanna know something else?

36:10.080 --> 36:12.330
I couldn't burn these, either.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.760
I-I-I think there's a reason you
need me to do these things with you,

36:14.770 --> 36:20.180
because, deep down, you know that your
mother was responsible for her own murder.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.750
Claire meade is innocent.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.490
Well, you're right.

36:31.630 --> 36:33.810
mbe next time we can get
there without the slap.

36:35.010 --> 36:36.900
thank you.

36:39.290 --> 36:40.110
I see, mrs. Meade.

36:40.120 --> 36:44.090
Well, then how would you describe your state
of mind at the time of fey sommers' death?

36:44.100 --> 36:45.130
Not too peachy.

36:45.140 --> 36:46.570
Peachy?

36:46.580 --> 36:52.470
Well, were you under the influence of any
prescription painkillers or antidepressants?

36:53.030 --> 36:56.400
I-I was on several medications.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.620
I was having an extremely
difficult and emotional time.

36:59.630 --> 37:01.320
My husband was having...

37:01.330 --> 37:04.530
a very public affair
with one of his employees.

37:03.970 --> 37:05.290
{\a6}Meet me in the
hallway,cheese fingers

37:04.540 --> 37:06.740
Do you know who this employee was?

37:06.750 --> 37:07.710
Yes, I do.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.660
And her name?

37:08.670 --> 37:10.390
Fey sommers.

37:11.450 --> 37:13.530
What made you change your mind?

37:13.540 --> 37:16.970
Nothing they do to claire meade
is gonna bring my mother back.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.400
Thank you, amanda.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.630
You did the right thing.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.510
Feels good, doesn't it?

37:26.150 --> 37:27.980
Eh, it'll pass.

37:33.690 --> 37:36.700
I don't know what I would
call my state of mind.

37:36.710 --> 37:38.450
you were crazy.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.740
Here's the proof.

37:44.350 --> 37:47.210
madam foreman, have
you reached a verdict?

37:47.220 --> 37:48.520
We have, your honor.

37:48.530 --> 37:51.950
We find, in the case of the
state vs. Claire meade...

37:54.990 --> 37:58.480
not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity.

38:16.110 --> 38:17.970
okay, I am outta here.

38:28.460 --> 38:29.900
Thank god.

38:32.290 --> 38:34.330
odor in the court.

38:34.340 --> 38:37.210
Claire meade has been
cleared of all charges.

38:37.220 --> 38:39.020
She is a free woman.

38:39.030 --> 38:42.140
A scent with a criminal
sensibility made her do it.

38:42.150 --> 38:46.370
Claire, you may be innocent,
but I sentence you to the chair--

38:46.380 --> 38:48.310
the beautician's chair.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.200
Go get your roots done, sweetie.

38:50.210 --> 38:52.160
Yore a free woman.

38:53.990 --> 38:58.380
I'd like to propose a toast
to my friends and my family,

38:58.390 --> 39:02.120
who helped to save me, and
to the future of "mode."

39:02.130 --> 39:03.830
to "mode."

39:05.110 --> 39:09.780
Daniel and alexis, we are here
together, and we will always be together.

39:09.790 --> 39:11.210
Welcome home, mom.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.380
I'll make an appointment
with my hairdresser.

39:17.550 --> 39:20.410
Well, look who saved the day.

39:20.940 --> 39:25.560
Daniel, I didn't really do anything,
except for almost drive myself to madness.

39:25.570 --> 39:28.780
Well, I don't know what to say.

39:34.270 --> 39:35.970
you're welcome.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.080
That...

39:38.090 --> 39:42.320
wasn't a whole boss-assistant thing
'cause of the sexual harassment-- oh.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.970
It was
friend-to-friend, though.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.740
So everyone's calling you a hero.

39:51.750 --> 39:56.150
Oh, look, gio, I-- I wanna pay
you back for that window I broke.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.140
No, forget it.

39:57.150 --> 40:01.090
Just buy a couple of extra
sandwiches, and we'll call it even.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.730
Oh, and, uh...

40:04.740 --> 40:07.070
about that note that I left you...

40:07.720 --> 40:11.240
Yeah. The one where you called
me, uh, "an annoying jerk"...

40:11.250 --> 40:12.730
- "Obnoxious"...
- all right.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.580
And "arrogant"?

40:13.590 --> 40:16.590
Okay, I was strung out on that perfume.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.930
It wasn't me.

40:17.940 --> 40:21.970
I wasn't in my right mind, but
nobody ever has to see this again.

40:22.460 --> 40:24.100
Okay.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.810
Okay.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.670
Okay. Okay.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.510
Okay. Okay.

40:53.060 --> 40:55.460
well, everything looks good.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.830
We're all ready for the insemination.

41:01.140 --> 41:03.100
sorry I'm te.

41:03.110 --> 41:05.590
Daniel and mrs. Meade wanted
to have some champagne.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.780
What is she doing here?

41:06.790 --> 41:07.970
She's with me.

41:07.980 --> 41:12.540
And I'm gonna be here for the next
nine months, so get used to it.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.800
It's okay.

41:14.810 --> 41:16.730
You're doing this for stuart.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.170
we're almost done. Have a look.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.780
And... there it is.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.180
well, look at that.

41:39.050 --> 41:39.740
let's go.
