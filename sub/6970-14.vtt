WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:11.100
For the first time
l feel time like a heartbeat,

00:11.177 --> 00:15.546
the seconds pumping in my breast
like a reckoning,

00:15.615 --> 00:20.143
the numinous mysteries
that once seemed so distant and unreal

00:20.220 --> 00:22.984
threatening clarity
in the presence of a truth

00:23.056 --> 00:25.616
entertained not in youth,

00:25.692 --> 00:28.252
but only in its passage.

00:28.328 --> 00:33.823
l feel these words as if their meaning
were weight being lifted from me,

00:33.900 --> 00:39.463
knowing that you will read them and share
my burden as l have come to trust no other.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.769
That you should know my heart,

00:41.841 --> 00:43.775
look into it,

00:43.843 --> 00:48.337
finding there the memory
and experience that belong to you,

00:48.415 --> 00:50.349
that are you,

00:50.417 --> 00:56.981
is a comfort to me now as l feel
the tethers loose and the prospects darken

00:57.057 --> 01:01.653
for the continuance of a journey
that began not so long ago,

01:01.728 --> 01:07.689
and which began again with a faith shaken
and strengthened by your convictions.

01:07.767 --> 01:11.897
lf not for which l might never have been
so strong now

01:11.971 --> 01:16.567
as l cross to face you
and look at you incomplete,

01:16.643 --> 01:19.476
hoping that you will forgive me

01:19.546 --> 01:23.414
for not making the rest
of the journey with you.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.171
Oncology?

02:19.239 --> 02:21.173
Thanks.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.812
Scully?

02:36.623 --> 02:39.990
l stole these from some guy
with a broken leg down the hall.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.722
He won't be able to catch me.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.424
How ya doing?

02:47.033 --> 02:49.661
l guess that's the question.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.367
Actually, l feel fine.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.235
Good.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.939
What exactly are we lookin' at here?

03:03.283 --> 03:06.150
lt's what's called a nasopharyngeal mass.

03:06.219 --> 03:11.122
lt's a growth on the wall between the superior
concha and the sphenoidal sinus.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.056
A growth?

03:13.126 --> 03:14.559
A tumor.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.197
You're the only one l've called.

03:24.003 --> 03:26.233
ls it operable?

03:26.306 --> 03:29.434
- No.
- But it's treatable?

03:29.509 --> 03:33.775
The truth is that the type
and placement of the tumor

03:33.846 --> 03:37.145
make it difficult... to the extreme.

03:39.852 --> 03:45.449
- l refuse to believe that.
- For all the times l have said that to you,

03:45.525 --> 03:48.824
l am as certain about this
as you have ever been.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.822
l have cancer.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.064
lt is a mass on the wall
between my sinus and cerebrum.

03:58.137 --> 04:03.734
lf it pushes into my brain, statistically
there is about zero chance of survival.

04:06.446 --> 04:12.646
l don't accept that. There must be people
who have received treatment for this who...

04:14.187 --> 04:16.178
Yes, there are.

04:26.699 --> 04:31.193
This news is the worst kind of surprise,
Agent Scully. l'm very sorry.

04:31.271 --> 04:36.208
Thank you, sir. l would appreciate it
if we could keep this confidential.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.439
l understand. l assume
you'll be taking a leave of absence.

04:39.512 --> 04:42.777
No, sir. l've asked my doctors
to hold on to my medical records

04:42.849 --> 04:46.546
until Agent Mulder and l can exhaust
an avenue of investigation.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.950
lnvestigation?

04:48.554 --> 04:52.547
Last year we pursued a case in which a
number of women, purported abductees,

04:52.625 --> 04:57.028
experienced similar symptoms after
having implants removed from their necks.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.462
A woman in Pennsylvania, Betsy Hagopian,

04:59.532 --> 05:02.330
was undergoing treatment
for nasopharyngeal tumor.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.529
We haven't been able to contact her yet.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.199
We have contacts
with the best physicians in the country.

05:08.274 --> 05:12.233
Yes, sir, but l would like to pursue this
through the Justice Department,

05:12.312 --> 05:15.645
rather than as a personal matter.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.963
l'm sorry. No early birds.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.373
We're looking for Betsy Hagopian.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.538
No one's returning our messages.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.173
Betsy's passed away.

05:50.249 --> 05:53.082
Just two-and-a-half weeks ago.
Are you a relation?

05:53.152 --> 05:55.712
No. We're with the FBl.

05:55.788 --> 05:59.690
- Been some kind of trouble?
- Betsy was part of a MUFON group.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.522
l don't know. l'm just the realtor.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.859
Do you mind if we come inside
and take a look?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.090
Hey, Scully.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.651
Listen to this.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.721
There are two lines coming in. One's lit.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.131
Someone's sending a fax
or a computer modem.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.795
But who? And to send what?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.522
Somebody must have remote access
to the system.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.784
And downloading data.

07:07.326 --> 07:12.628
Copying files. Let's get a trace on them
before whoever it is hangs up.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.902
Apartment 234 is listed under Kurt Crawford.

07:26.412 --> 07:30.473
l'm gonna check around back.
See if you can get the manager.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.051
Stop! Federal agent!

08:10.456 --> 08:11.821
Hold it!

08:13.826 --> 08:16.693
Put your hands where we can see them!

08:16.762 --> 08:18.559
ls your name Kurt Crawford?

08:19.298 --> 08:20.697
Yes.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.095
- Scully?
- What?

08:32.979 --> 08:34.970
l'm fine, Mulder.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.982
Quit starin' at me. l'm fine.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.455
- You OK, Scully?
- Yeah. l'm just washing up.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.780
You took his cuffs off.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.944
He's a member of the same UFO network
Betsy Hagopian belonged to.

09:13.019 --> 09:16.284
He was downloading files for safekeeping,
as Betsy had asked him.

09:16.355 --> 09:18.880
- Why did he run?
- He thinks his life's in danger.

09:18.958 --> 09:23.156
That there's a government conspiracy to
suppress the information in those files.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.925
- You think he's credible?
- He knows a lot

09:25.998 --> 09:30.298
about what happened to Betsy
and the other women in her MUFON group.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.270
That will have to be cross-checked.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.236
We can't.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.405
Why not?

09:50.356 --> 09:52.347
How did they die?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.223
Brain cancer. All within the last year.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.761
All of them?

09:57.830 --> 10:00.560
From the group you met,
there's only Penny Northern.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.625
She's in the hospital,
and it doesn't look good.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.764
What makes you think
it's a government conspiracy?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.775
What makes you think it isn't?

10:11.844 --> 10:16.281
11 women are abducted, all with similar
recollections about the experience.

10:16.349 --> 10:20.615
All developing identical brain tumors,
and all refused state health care

10:20.686 --> 10:25.214
because of their insistence of the facts.
And all dying within the space of a year.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.693
- l want you to listen to me.
- About what?

10:34.433 --> 10:37.300
About what you're denying.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.703
- What am l denying?
- Where your cancer came from.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.866
- lt doesn't matter.
- lt does.

10:42.942 --> 10:46.241
lf it's a result of your abduction, and that
is something the government knows,

10:46.312 --> 10:49.907
- these facts should be brought to light.
- l don't know what happened.

10:49.982 --> 10:54.919
l have no clear recollection, and l don't think
these abductions are even abductions.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.750
These women are dead.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.086
No, they are not.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.790
One woman isn't. This Penny Northern.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.796
lf you won't listen to me, then go talk to her.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.859
About what?

11:11.871 --> 11:14.567
What it feels like to be dying of cancer?

11:15.675 --> 11:19.236
What it's like to know
there is nothing you can do about it.

11:19.311 --> 11:23.338
lf that's too hard for you,
then go as an investigator.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.476
You have one remaining witness,
Agent Scully.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.817
l'd think you'd want to know
what her story is.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.602
Dana. Hello.

11:51.644 --> 11:55.307
l'm sorry. Did somebody tell you
l was coming to see you?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.575
No.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.118
Then how did you know it was me?

12:00.219 --> 12:02.585
l recognized you.

12:02.655 --> 12:06.056
l told you when we met last year.

12:06.125 --> 12:10.027
l held you and comforted you
in the place... after the tests.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.623
l'm sorry. l don't mean to be insensitive, but

12:15.267 --> 12:17.667
l don't share those memories.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.073
lt's all right.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.570
l've come to ask you some questions.

12:26.645 --> 12:30.342
- About Dr Scanlon?
- No. Who's Dr Scanlon?

12:31.450 --> 12:35.113
He's treating the cancer. He treated Betsy too.

12:35.187 --> 12:38.179
He thinks he might have isolated the cause.

12:41.694 --> 12:46.927
And that if he'd caught it earlier,
he might have been able to do more for her.

12:47.466 --> 12:48.933
And for me.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.173
- His name's Scanlon?
- Yes.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.308
What did you want to ask me?

13:15.761 --> 13:17.695
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.789
- Where are you, Scully?
- With Penny Northern.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.027
- Where are you?
- At Betsy Hagopian's

13:23.102 --> 13:26.037
going through files
before they start disappearing.

13:26.105 --> 13:30.735
And l think l've found something. Some of
these women who've died were childless.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.334
They've been treated at an infertility clinic,

13:33.412 --> 13:36.108
Penny Northern
and Betsy Hagopian among them.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.809
- Mulder...
- l've made calls,

13:37.917 --> 13:40.909
tried to get information,
but nobody is talking to me.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.817
l need you to come up here.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.549
Did you find something?

13:45.891 --> 13:49.088
l need you to bring
the overnight bag from the car.

13:49.195 --> 13:53.723
And l need you to call my mother and ask her
to bring some things to the hospital.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.391
Anything l should know?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.628
Whatever you found,

13:57.703 --> 14:00.331
or whatever you might find,

14:01.106 --> 14:03.836
l think we both know that

14:03.909 --> 14:07.310
right now the truth is in me.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.508
And that's where l need to pursue it

14:12.718 --> 14:14.652
as soon as possible.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.514
l will be right there.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.046
Agent Mulder?

16:20.446 --> 16:21.913
Dana?

16:21.981 --> 16:25.246
l'm Dr Scanlon.
We spoke last night on the phone.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.978
Yeah. Hi. Sorry.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.290
l was sleeping.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.816
l noticed.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.286
How's your energy level, generally?

16:42.201 --> 16:43.793
l don't feel sick at all.

16:43.869 --> 16:48.397
Your MRls and your charts aren't here yet.
But l have an idea what to expect.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.238
You probably do too,
from your medical training.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.837
l know that the chemotherapy
is going to make me sick.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.404
And the radiation.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.714
lt's a high-dose approach
to knock your system down

17:00.786 --> 17:04.722
so that we can attempt
a gene therapy on P-53.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.086
You're gonna feel like dying.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.766
- Dana.
- Hi, Mom.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.469
This is Dr Scanlon.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.675
l drove.

17:28.647 --> 17:32.708
l was gonna take the shuttle,
but it's only an hour more by car.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.076
Can you imagine?

17:36.288 --> 17:40.418
l'm fine. l'm going to be fine.
l'm just here for treatment.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.357
l'm gonna go.

17:42.428 --> 17:46.660
l've ordered additional blood work.
l'd like to start in this afternoon.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.290
Thank you.

17:51.203 --> 17:56.664
Mom, l know what you're going to say,
but l don't have any experience being sick.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.903
l promise you, l feel fine.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.778
l don't know why you didn't tell me.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.650
l don't know why you
didn't tell me immediately!

18:18.097 --> 18:20.964
l wanted to get all the answers first.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.666
And you found them here?

18:30.242 --> 18:32.904
l have found some clarity.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.180
And maybe a way to fight back.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.711
l don't wanna be kept in the dark.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.123
You'll know, Mom.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.735
You have always been the strong one.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.868
But you're my only daughter now.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.543
l know.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.894
(Scully's voice) ln med school,

19:23.962 --> 19:27.625
l learned that cancer arrives
in the body unannounced,

19:28.500 --> 19:31.765
a dark stranger who takes up residence,

19:31.837 --> 19:35.466
turning its new home against itself.

19:36.942 --> 19:40.070
This is the evil of cancer,

19:40.145 --> 19:42.443
that it starts as an invader,

19:42.514 --> 19:45.677
but soon becomes one with the invaded,

19:45.751 --> 19:48.311
forcing you to destroy it.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.049
But only at the risk of destroying yourself.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.027
lt is science's demon possession.

19:58.096 --> 20:02.465
My treatments, science's attempt at exorcism.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.104
Mulder, l hope that in these terms

20:07.172 --> 20:11.233
you might know it and know me,

20:11.310 --> 20:13.471
and accept this stranger
so many recognize

20:13.545 --> 20:17.037
but cannot ever completely cast out.

20:19.484 --> 20:24.353
And if the darkness should have
swallowed me as you read this,

20:24.423 --> 20:29.520
you must never think there was
the possibility of some secret intervention,

20:29.595 --> 20:31.654
something you might have done.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.598
And though we've traveled far together,

20:36.668 --> 20:41.128
this last distance must necessarily
be traveled alone.

21:19.911 --> 21:23.677
l've got a gun pointed at your head.
Turn around very slowly.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.648
Kurt Crawford.
We travel in the same circles these days.

21:33.725 --> 21:34.851
Put the gun away.

21:34.926 --> 21:39.795
You disappeared with those files from Betsy
Hagopian's. l got to thinking you were a liar.

21:39.865 --> 21:43.323
- Tell me l'm wrong.
- l'm looking for the same thing you are.

21:43.402 --> 21:47.168
l've been trying to hack into that system,
but l need the password.

21:47.239 --> 21:51.437
- You think you can get access from here?
- l need to find that password.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.693
''Vegreville.''

22:21.073 --> 22:22.904
We're in.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.613
(Penny) Dana?

22:39.558 --> 22:42.118
lt's OK, Dana. You'll be OK.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.831
Where am l?

22:54.906 --> 22:58.398
You're in your own bed now.
You're safe.

22:59.845 --> 23:02.473
l feel nauseous.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.574
lt's the chemo.
The chemo was always the worst.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.483
l had a bad dream.

23:17.496 --> 23:21.091
Someone was doing something bad to me.

23:26.705 --> 23:30.471
You were there. l heard your voice.

23:31.676 --> 23:35.373
They let me come to you
during the procedures.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.481
l don't know why.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.450
Human compassion
is not something that they have.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.453
l'm sorry, Penny.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.684
l can't hear this right now.

23:52.998 --> 23:56.331
You've got to try and make sense of it, Dana.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.701
lt'll help you through the pain.

24:00.906 --> 24:03.966
To understand why this is...

24:04.042 --> 24:05.976
this is happening to you.

24:20.725 --> 24:23.353
l need you to set up a meeting for me.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.594
Hold all my calls.

24:31.536 --> 24:32.764
Where's Agent Scully?

24:32.838 --> 24:36.604
ln a hospital in Allentown
beginning treatment.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.109
What happened
to your investigative avenues?

24:39.177 --> 24:43.011
They've taken a turn.
A pretty big U-turn, by the looks of it.

24:43.081 --> 24:48.576
This is a file from a federally operated fertility
clinic. Agent Scully's name is on this file.

24:48.653 --> 24:52.419
Although l'm damn sure
she's never undergone infertility treatment.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.324
- What's in the file?
- lt's just a directory

24:55.393 --> 24:58.123
for a mainframe
in the Lombard Research Facility.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.687
So you want a meeting. With whom?

25:03.201 --> 25:05.499
The cigarette man.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.203
l have no doubt he's behind this.

25:08.306 --> 25:12.800
- You've come to me before like this.
- This is different. l'm willing to deal.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.779
- Find another way.
- No. No! l need that meeting.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.214
You offer this man anything
and he will own you forever.

25:19.284 --> 25:23.482
He knows what they did to Agent Scully!
He may know how to save her!

25:23.555 --> 25:27.651
Then you can know too, but you
can't ask the truth of a man who trades in lies.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.661
We are talking about Agent Scully's life.

25:30.729 --> 25:32.629
Find another way.

25:40.238 --> 25:45.471
The Lombard system is a dedicated
mainframe, impossible to hack, so they say.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.479
- How'd you guys get in?
- A modified clipper chip

25:48.547 --> 25:51.175
from a government army field encoder.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.444
We bought it back from the Chinese.

25:54.486 --> 25:59.788
But for what we got on Agent Scully's file,
we don't know how much help it's gonna be.

25:59.858 --> 26:03.225
- What do you mean?
- lt's a gene code we've seen before.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.855
Detected in Scully's blood
after her abduction.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.295
Does it tell us anything?

26:07.365 --> 26:10.357
Normal DNA is inactive
when in its helical form.

26:10.435 --> 26:13.165
When it's unwound, or branched like this,

26:13.238 --> 26:16.765
- that's when it can mutate.
- lt's what made her sick.

26:16.841 --> 26:19.810
Why store this, and why keep it a secret?

26:19.878 --> 26:22.278
Scientists get funky
when their research is poached.

26:22.347 --> 26:25.043
Somebody might be trying to find a cause.

26:25.116 --> 26:28.142
- Or a cure.
- Theoretically.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.646
You guys ever been to
the Lombard Research Facility?

26:34.292 --> 26:39.855
Pick out something black and sexy
and prepare to do some funky poaching.

26:48.907 --> 26:53.207
lt's funny. l always thought of you
as Fox Mulder's patron.

26:56.247 --> 26:59.683
You'd think under your aegis, he wouldn't
work in a corner of the basement.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.982
At least he doesn't
take an elevator up to get to work.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.851
You think l'm the devil?

27:04.923 --> 27:07.016
l'm not here to talk about you.

27:07.092 --> 27:09.617
Then why are you here?

27:10.095 --> 27:13.223
ls it Mulder's partner and her illness?

27:15.934 --> 27:18.801
ls it terminal? ls it cancer?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.633
You tell me.

27:20.705 --> 27:25.438
Modern medicine today...
l hear they can perform miracles.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.381
l need a miracle.

27:34.719 --> 27:38.780
You think a lot more of me
than you let on, Mr Skinner.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.985
- What'll it take?
- For Agent Scully's life?

27:44.496 --> 27:47.624
- What would you offer?
- What'll it take?

27:57.208 --> 28:00.541
l'll have to get back to you on that.

28:03.581 --> 28:05.572
Mr Skinner.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.448
Which way is the elevator?

28:39.751 --> 28:42.185
He'll double back in 54 seconds.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.790
Frohike, where are you guys?

28:46.858 --> 28:50.555
ln the K-section of a storm drain
where the communications system

28:50.628 --> 28:52.619
links up to public power.

28:54.065 --> 28:54.929
Stand by.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.871
Two minutes for a system check.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.376
We gotta go.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.371
We're in motion.

29:19.224 --> 29:20.191
They're in.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.523
Security camera's off-line, patching in now.

29:24.295 --> 29:29.858
Smile, Byers. You're on Candid Camera.
Exterior security has been breached.

29:49.954 --> 29:54.391
- Langly, are you reading this?
- Redundant systems... This is a toughie.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.657
You couldn't get two of these?
What is going on?

29:57.729 --> 30:00.220
Mulder, this is gonna take a moment.

30:12.043 --> 30:15.672
We have a problem. The doctor
treating Scully is on staff here.

30:15.747 --> 30:19.911
More mysteries await. Bypass is complete.

30:22.287 --> 30:26.849
l need someone to get Scully's treatment
stopped. You're the only one who can do that.

30:30.261 --> 30:33.059
l've not written in 24 hours

30:33.131 --> 30:37.864
because the treatment has weakened
my spirit as well as my body.

30:37.936 --> 30:42.032
Mulder, it's dicult to describe
the fear of facing an enemy

30:42.106 --> 30:45.371
which l can neither conquer nor escape.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.435
Penny Northern has taken a downturn.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.971
l look at her with a respect
that can only come from one

30:52.050 --> 30:55.383
who is about to walk the same dark path.

30:55.453 --> 31:00.220
Seeing her, l can't help but see myself
in a month or a year.

31:00.291 --> 31:04.751
l pray that l have her courage
to face this journey.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.229
Mulder, l feel you close

31:07.298 --> 31:10.529
though l know you are now
pursuing your own path.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.162
For that l am grateful,

31:13.238 --> 31:15.968
more than l could ever express.

31:16.040 --> 31:20.909
l need to know you are out there
if l am ever to see through this.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.913
Langly, where the hell am l going?

31:23.248 --> 31:25.182
We're losing you on the video.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.678
Mulder? Did you do anything, Frohike?

31:28.753 --> 31:30.277
l didn't touch a thing.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.035
Langly, can you hear me?

31:47.105 --> 31:49.039
Langly, l can't hear you.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.268
Open the door.

31:54.345 --> 31:56.370
Open the damn door!

32:04.589 --> 32:07.080
Agent Mulder, come in.

32:15.366 --> 32:19.393
- You're hybrids.
- Please come in so that we might explain.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.176
- You've been using me.
- Not at all.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.811
Your arrival was only coincident
with the execution of our objective.

33:09.887 --> 33:13.846
- What objective?
- To subvert the project.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.689
The project that created us.

33:29.107 --> 33:31.974
l've seen this boy before.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.002
These boys are you.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.715
We're among the end results.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.809
- And you wanna destroy them?
- No!

33:42.887 --> 33:45.788
What we want
is the same thing that you want.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.225
What are these?

33:57.301 --> 33:59.394
Human ova.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.634
Taken from whom?

34:19.223 --> 34:20.121
What?

34:21.225 --> 34:24.991
Harvested during her abduction
through a radiation procedure

34:25.063 --> 34:28.760
that caused... superovulation.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.460
- Why?
- For fertilization.

34:32.170 --> 34:36.368
They constitute one half of
the necessary raw materials.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.607
For genetic hybridization.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.272
For reproduction.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.085
These women...

34:51.456 --> 34:53.481
These women are your birth mothers.

34:53.558 --> 34:58.621
Barren now... from the same procedure
that caused their cancer.

34:58.696 --> 35:04.635
And now they're left to die, their conditions
hastened by the men running this project.

35:05.036 --> 35:08.267
- You're trying to save them.
- They're our mothers.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.189
Mulder, do you copy?

35:29.260 --> 35:31.194
Langly, l can't hear you.

35:31.262 --> 35:34.663
You've got a security breach in section J-14.

35:34.732 --> 35:38.395
- You sure it's not Byers?
- Nope. l've got Byers on my screen.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.159
Langly, l don't know where l am.

36:06.230 --> 36:09.063
You're in a bio-quarantine wing
leading to an exit.

36:09.133 --> 36:13.729
At the end of the hall,
you'll access a door to a bio-secure room.

36:16.974 --> 36:19.841
OK, l'm here. Open the door.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.472
The doors work under redundant systems.
We're working fast.

36:30.988 --> 36:32.421
Work faster!

36:40.731 --> 36:43.700
Langly, open the door now!

36:50.241 --> 36:51.503
Get me outta here!

36:56.347 --> 36:58.076
Get me outta here now!

36:58.449 --> 36:59.438
Almost there.

37:05.022 --> 37:05.545
Go!

37:52.403 --> 37:54.030
- Nurse.
- Just a minute.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.233
Nurse! Dana Scully's supposed to be
in her room. Where is she?

37:57.308 --> 37:59.333
- She's not there?
- What happened to her?

37:59.410 --> 38:01.435
- l don't know.
- Who the hell does know?

38:01.512 --> 38:02.843
Mulder!

38:04.548 --> 38:06.982
- What happened to Scully?
- l got to her.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.985
Where is she now?

38:24.735 --> 38:27.670
Dr Scanlon isn't coming back?

38:29.407 --> 38:30.237
No.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.473
l don't think so, Penny.

38:35.613 --> 38:36.443
Dana,

38:37.848 --> 38:40.476
l want you to get well.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.019
You've been such a comfort.

38:46.123 --> 38:48.921
You've got to be the one.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.791
You can't give up hope.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.124
l haven't.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.095
l won't.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.699
ls she gone?

39:44.181 --> 39:46.115
l'm sorry.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.984
l know what she meant to you.

39:52.256 --> 39:56.488
When l came to find you
and you weren't in your room,

39:56.560 --> 39:59.393
l got scared
that something had happened.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.730
And l read some of what you wrote.

40:10.107 --> 40:12.041
l didn't want you to read that.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.705
l had decided to throw it out.

40:16.781 --> 40:19.409
l decided tonight that...

40:22.153 --> 40:25.589
That l'm not gonna let this thing beat me.

40:27.458 --> 40:31.554
l came into this hospital able to work.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.154
And that's how l'm leaving.

40:40.504 --> 40:43.735
- Byers tell you about Dr Scanlon?
- Yes.

40:43.808 --> 40:47.505
He may very well have killed those women.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.638
That will have to be proven... if we find him.

40:50.714 --> 40:52.875
When we find him.

40:52.950 --> 40:57.148
Something was done to you. Something
you're just beginning to remember.

40:57.221 --> 41:01.487
You can't quite figure it out,
but it can be explained, and it will be.

41:01.559 --> 41:05.290
And no matter what you think
as a scientist or a doctor,

41:05.362 --> 41:09.298
there is a way and you will find it,

41:09.366 --> 41:11.994
to save yourself.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.741
Mulder, l can't kid myself.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.174
People live with cancer.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.235
They carry on.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.110
And so will l.

41:26.183 --> 41:29.983
You know, l've got things to finish,

41:30.054 --> 41:33.615
to prove to myself, to my family.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.626
But for my own reasons.

41:45.569 --> 41:48.663
Come on back.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.253
The truth will save you, Scully.

42:07.992 --> 42:10.620
l think it'll save both of us.

42:51.468 --> 42:54.926
- Skinner.
- l was leavin'you a voicemail.

42:55.005 --> 42:57.940
- lt's 5:30. What are you...
- How can l help you?

42:58.008 --> 43:02.968
l want you to know that Scully's doing OK.
She says she's coming back to work.

43:03.047 --> 43:06.107
Good. That's good to hear.

43:06.183 --> 43:09.778
Thank you for your advice
about our chain-smoking friend.

43:09.853 --> 43:12.822
You were right.
We have to know what he knows.

43:12.890 --> 43:14.881
We just have to find another way.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.587
There's always another way.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.363
Yes, l believe there is,

43:31.642 --> 43:34.076
if you're willing to pay the price.
