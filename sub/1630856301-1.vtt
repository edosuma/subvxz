WEBVTT

00:17.155 --> 00:20.020
[wind howling]

00:20.158 --> 00:22.574
[eerie music]

02:06.643 --> 02:08.335
[sighs]

02:24.005 --> 02:25.835
[eerie music]

02:29.977 --> 02:31.634
[gasps]

02:40.988 --> 02:42.714
- Kia ora.

02:43.473 --> 02:45.303
Oh, going for a bit
of a stroll, eh?

02:45.441 --> 02:46.856
Going up to the new extension?

02:46.994 --> 02:48.513
Well, if you do,
could you just do me a solid

02:48.651 --> 02:50.584
and, uh, be wary of the traps?

02:50.722 --> 02:52.068
Should be totally fine,
you know,

02:52.206 --> 02:53.483
cos they're signposted.

02:53.621 --> 02:54.795
But, uh, they're close
to the track

02:54.933 --> 02:56.693
in case you wanna
run off for a mimi.

02:56.831 --> 02:58.488
- OK.

02:58.626 --> 02:59.800
- Almost killed all the goats.

02:59.938 --> 03:01.905
They do untold damage
to the bush.

03:02.043 --> 03:03.459
You wouldn't realize it, eh,

03:03.597 --> 03:06.876
but if you compared goated
land to ungoated land,

03:07.014 --> 03:09.189
well, you'd be surprised.

03:13.607 --> 03:15.712
Walking on your own, eh?

03:15.850 --> 03:17.369
- Yeah.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.306
- Oh, well,
I'll leave you to it, eh?

03:23.444 --> 03:25.205
[pats roof]

03:49.194 --> 03:51.472
[eerie music]

04:27.232 --> 04:29.338
[panting]

05:42.514 --> 05:44.620
- Ow.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.778
- I'll line it up, babe.

06:41.918 --> 06:42.988
- OK.

06:43.126 --> 06:44.783
Perfect. That'll work.
- Sweet.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.302
All right.
- OK. So...

06:46.440 --> 06:47.683
- So, let's...
- I reckon...

06:47.821 --> 06:50.099
get me when I'm, like, going up.

06:50.237 --> 06:52.929
- OK, I'll try my best. Promise.
- OK. Three, two, one.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.655
Go! [laughs]

06:54.793 --> 06:56.070
No, I didn't think so.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.107
Let's do it again,
and then make sure, like,

06:58.245 --> 07:00.420
it kind of looks natural. I kind
of wanna make it to look like

07:00.558 --> 07:02.145
I'm going into the bush. OK?
- OK.

07:02.283 --> 07:05.217
Sounds amazing.
- So, one, two, three.

07:05.355 --> 07:06.564
[woman laughs]

07:10.464 --> 07:12.362
- Go with it way more.

07:12.811 --> 07:13.812
- Oh my...

07:13.950 --> 07:16.159
Austin!
- What?

07:16.643 --> 07:18.507
- How can you say that's
a good photo when my--

07:18.645 --> 07:20.440
the frond is over my face?!
- Amazing.

07:20.578 --> 07:22.442
That's the reason
why it's good.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.236
OK?
- You're the pits.

07:24.374 --> 07:26.238
Look at it!

07:26.549 --> 07:27.757
- Hot!

07:27.895 --> 07:29.518
- There's some good ones...
- Yeah?

07:29.656 --> 07:31.589
- Babe. Are you kidding me?

07:31.727 --> 07:33.832
Look at that!

07:59.271 --> 08:01.170
- Oh, God.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.594
[panting]

08:26.229 --> 08:27.645
Oh, God.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.139
- Oh, golly, gosh.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.556
- Motoring ahead.

08:42.694 --> 08:44.800
- What?
- Motoring ahead.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.391
- Ah.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.945
- Wow.
- Crazy.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.498
- This is...

08:53.636 --> 08:55.086
- Nice.

08:55.224 --> 08:56.294
- Wait.

08:56.432 --> 08:57.364
Hang on.

08:57.502 --> 08:58.503
What is...?

08:58.641 --> 09:00.263
Babe, look at this!

09:03.646 --> 09:05.096
Look.

09:05.234 --> 09:05.993
Look at this.

09:06.131 --> 09:08.340
Look at the color of these.

09:08.858 --> 09:10.688
- Awesome.
- Oh!

09:10.826 --> 09:13.553
Oh, they don't really
smell much.

09:14.450 --> 09:15.658
Wow.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.764
This place...

09:18.281 --> 09:20.214
so beautiful.

09:23.528 --> 09:25.530
[sniffs] Smell that.

09:25.668 --> 09:28.775
Sort of a smell?
Not really, though, hey?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.126
[sighs]

09:56.457 --> 09:57.769
- Hey, mate.
- Oh!

09:57.907 --> 09:59.322
- Sorry.
Did I frighten you, bro?

09:59.460 --> 10:02.118
- I didn't know
anyone else was-was here.

10:02.256 --> 10:05.397
- Oh. Yeah,
I'm pretty light on my feet.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.261
Hold on.
Where are you going?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.574
- Oh, I've got to--
I've gotta keep going.

10:09.712 --> 10:11.541
- You gotta keep--?
I mean, you only just sat down.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.440
I saw ya.

10:13.578 --> 10:15.753
I first saw you about
half an hour ago, actually.

10:15.891 --> 10:17.617
You were quite far ahead of me,
but I said, "You know what?

10:17.755 --> 10:20.033
"I'm gonna catch that guy,
and I'm gonna track him down."

10:20.171 --> 10:22.069
Here we are 15 minutes later.

10:22.207 --> 10:24.209
Found ya. Well, you'd stopped,

10:24.347 --> 10:26.246
but still, not bad.

10:28.558 --> 10:29.767
[slurping]

10:30.768 --> 10:33.011
[gargling]

10:33.702 --> 10:34.703
Ah!

10:34.841 --> 10:36.601
Agua.

10:36.739 --> 10:38.223
Water.

10:38.361 --> 10:40.709
I'm Nicky, by the way.
- Oh.

10:41.364 --> 10:43.228
Uh, nice to meet you.

10:45.127 --> 10:46.784
- Am I gonna hear
your name, bro, or...?

10:46.922 --> 10:48.130
- Uh...

10:48.268 --> 10:49.096
Ian.

10:49.234 --> 10:51.098
- Uh Ian?

10:51.512 --> 10:54.343
Well, it's good to meet you,
Uh Ian.

10:54.999 --> 10:57.380
It's your first time up here?

10:57.795 --> 10:59.797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:59.935 --> 11:01.971
Big on hiking, though?

11:02.558 --> 11:03.732
- Uh...

11:03.870 --> 11:05.181
not really.

11:05.319 --> 11:06.700
- And yet here we are on
one of the biggest tracks

11:06.838 --> 11:08.495
in the entire country.
That's bold, Ian.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.910
- Um, I'm gonna keep going.

11:10.048 --> 11:12.568
- Oh, yeah. Cool.
I'll come with ya.

11:13.293 --> 11:15.502
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- Yeah. It'd be fun.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.228
I don't mind.

11:17.366 --> 11:19.333
- No, no, you don't have--
you don't have to come with me.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.783
- Don't have to do
a lot of things I do,

11:20.921 --> 11:22.751
but I do 'em
because I like 'em.

11:22.889 --> 11:24.235
- No, honestly, it's fine.

11:24.373 --> 11:25.995
You rest, and I'll--
- Nah. I've done enough resting.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.790
I'll tell you what.
You set the pace. OK?

11:27.928 --> 11:29.619
We go as slow as you want.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.864
I'm going so fast. Quite enjoy
just the peace and the quiet.

11:33.002 --> 11:35.487
You know, just me and the bush.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.937
And you.

11:37.075 --> 11:39.112
Me, Ian and the bush.

11:41.631 --> 11:42.736
Come on.

11:45.774 --> 11:47.361
I kind of bounce around,
d'you know what I mean?

11:47.499 --> 11:49.398
From place to place.
Always, you know,

11:49.536 --> 11:52.539
doing little different bits
and pieces at different spots.

11:52.677 --> 11:56.060
I guess they kind of call it
innovation nowadays, don't they?

11:56.198 --> 11:57.751
I think it's something
like that. But I don't think

11:57.889 --> 12:00.236
your job title
should be what defines you

12:00.374 --> 12:01.721
as a person.

12:01.859 --> 12:03.757
You know what I mean?

12:03.895 --> 12:05.034
Ian, do you know what I mean?

12:05.172 --> 12:06.864
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:07.002 --> 12:08.451
Oh! Watch your feet.

12:08.589 --> 12:10.074
That's it. That's better.

12:10.212 --> 12:12.801
You really gotta lift
over these roots.

12:12.939 --> 12:14.112
You don't wanna get
caught on anything.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.631
Imagine spraining
your ankle out here.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.185
- Y-You go...
- Huh?

12:18.323 --> 12:20.740
- You go first.
- Oh, no, you go.

12:20.878 --> 12:22.672
- You go first.
- Nah, honestly.

12:22.811 --> 12:24.088
Go for it.

12:27.436 --> 12:28.817
Good man.

12:28.955 --> 12:31.371
Anyway, you've gotta do what
you've gotta do to earn a crust.

12:31.509 --> 12:32.993
What do you do?

12:33.131 --> 12:35.478
Some kind of administration,
reception or something?

12:35.616 --> 12:37.791
You're a secretary somewhere?
- No.

12:37.929 --> 12:40.207
- Hospitality?
You serve drinks and that?

12:40.345 --> 12:41.691
- No.
- Right.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.798
Retail? Selling clothes?
- No. I...

12:45.109 --> 12:46.766
- Selling some kind
of a product.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.112
- I had my own business.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.630
- You had your own business?
- Yeah.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.356
- Oh.

12:51.494 --> 12:54.532
Yeah, no, I was gonna say that
one next, obviously, but... Huh.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.534
Wait, hold on.
You hadyour own business?

12:56.672 --> 12:57.949
- Yeah.

12:58.087 --> 13:00.814
- You don't have it anymore?
- No.

13:01.919 --> 13:03.092
- What happened?

13:03.230 --> 13:05.060
- Oh, listen,
I'm just gonna go...

13:05.198 --> 13:07.338
I just gotta go, um...
- What?

13:07.476 --> 13:08.857
- I just gotta go...

13:08.995 --> 13:11.135
- What?

13:11.273 --> 13:12.515
What, you need to take a slash?
- Yeah.

13:12.653 --> 13:13.862
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.140
- Well, just go here.
I'll turn around.

13:20.178 --> 13:21.731
So I found all the texts,

13:21.870 --> 13:23.699
got all the grisly details,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.908
and that's when I ended it.

13:26.253 --> 13:28.359
Honestly, it was any guy.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.361
Like, any guy.

13:30.499 --> 13:32.190
Even old guys.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.813
Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- No.

13:33.951 --> 13:35.159
- You do?
- No.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.713
- You can if you want to.
- No, I don't.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.542
- Doesn't matter anyway.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.027
We made it.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.928
[panting]

13:46.066 --> 13:47.378
- The light's on.

13:47.516 --> 13:49.656
- Well, yeah,
there'll be other campers there.

13:50.519 --> 13:52.141
Maybe even a couple of honeys,
if you know what I mean.

13:52.279 --> 13:53.936
One for you, one for me.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.144
Unless there's
more than two of them--

13:55.282 --> 13:56.766
maybe two for me, one for you.

13:56.905 --> 13:59.321
- I might carry on
to the next hut.

13:59.459 --> 14:00.874
- The next hut's
a day's walk away.

14:01.012 --> 14:02.289
- Yeah.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.774
- Well, you'll die
of exposure, ya twit.

14:04.913 --> 14:06.984
Come on.
- OK, OK.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.987
Oh, God. Oh my God.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.581
- Word of warning, mate,

14:18.719 --> 14:20.790
these ste-ink!

14:21.032 --> 14:21.826
[sniffs]

14:21.964 --> 14:24.035
[chuckles]

14:27.073 --> 14:28.729
Oh...

14:28.868 --> 14:30.559
I think it's hormones.

14:33.389 --> 14:34.770
Hurry up.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.151
- I just- I'll just sort
my feet out.

14:36.289 --> 14:38.360
You go in.
I'll be in-in a sec.

14:38.498 --> 14:39.775
- Righto.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.018
How do I look?
- Yeah. Good.

14:41.156 --> 14:42.743
- Good. [laughs]

14:42.882 --> 14:44.953
Hello, hello, hello!

14:51.545 --> 14:53.651
[tense music]

15:00.175 --> 15:01.624
I can imagine.
- Oh, mate.

15:01.762 --> 15:03.350
You don't know what it's like.
- No, I can imagine.

15:03.488 --> 15:06.422
- It came at me, you know?
I just held it like this.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.459
Like, literally...

15:09.115 --> 15:10.702
- There he is.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.739
This is Ian.
- Oh, Ian.

15:12.877 --> 15:14.016
Hello.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.570
- Made him
my personal challenge.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.400
I said, "You're gonna
catch him in 20 minutes."

15:18.538 --> 15:21.023
Ended up catching him in 10.

15:21.161 --> 15:23.612
I always catch whatever
I put my eye on.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.443
Oh, uh, Ian, this is Monica.

15:27.581 --> 15:29.480
This is Austin.
They're from Australia.

15:29.618 --> 15:30.860
- Hi.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.655
- Austin used to be a safari
ranger back in Zimbabwe.

15:32.793 --> 15:33.967
- Hey.

15:34.105 --> 15:35.935
- That's how they met.
- OK.

15:36.073 --> 15:38.006
- Have we met before?

15:38.351 --> 15:40.387
- I don't think so.

15:41.285 --> 15:43.597
- Yeah, we have.

15:44.357 --> 15:46.462
Haven't we?
- Mm...

15:46.807 --> 15:47.947
I don't know, babes.

15:48.085 --> 15:49.500
- Oh. Where should I put my bag?

15:49.638 --> 15:51.053
- Oh, just go and claim
one of the bunks, doll.

15:51.191 --> 15:52.192
- Just not too close to me.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.022
I don't wanna wake up cuddling.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.473
You know, I don't want
spooning or anything.

16:01.512 --> 16:03.893
I hope you don't
bloody snore, Ian.

16:04.860 --> 16:08.760
Oh, I think they're
on their bloody honeymoon.

16:09.175 --> 16:12.592
So I'm going to have
you in one bed snoring...

16:13.696 --> 16:15.560
and them in the other...

16:15.698 --> 16:17.286
rooting.

16:18.736 --> 16:20.117
[sighs]

16:22.429 --> 16:24.500
See you out there.
- OK.

16:25.053 --> 16:26.468
- Do you guys like cards?

16:40.516 --> 16:42.242
Soup time.

16:43.105 --> 16:45.004
Ooh, mama.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.630
[pots rattling]

17:01.572 --> 17:04.023
- Do you think anyone else
is gonna come tonight?

17:04.161 --> 17:05.748
- I wouldn't have thought so.

17:05.886 --> 17:09.097
Fuckwalking in that, anyway.
It's like liquorice soup.

17:10.201 --> 17:11.375
Plus, it's the end
of the season,

17:11.513 --> 17:14.343
so not likely to
be anyone around.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.011
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

17:27.356 --> 17:29.427
Take your time.

17:40.818 --> 17:42.544
- OK. I think I'm done.
- Come on, Ian.

17:42.682 --> 17:44.270
You barely finished
cooking your meat.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.444
- It's- It's fine.
- Finish cooking your meat, Ian.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.308
Come on. I wouldn't live
with myself if you got sick.

17:48.446 --> 17:50.724
- It's all right. It's fine.

17:53.175 --> 17:54.763
- You brought meat?

17:55.281 --> 17:57.179
- Yeah. Yeah.
I thought it was weird, too.

17:57.317 --> 17:59.250
- Hey, did you pack
the hemp milk, babe?

17:59.388 --> 18:01.218
- Yeah.
- Oh, but...

18:01.356 --> 18:02.805
I just can't find it.

18:02.943 --> 18:04.600
- I'll come take a look.

18:06.257 --> 18:07.707
- Come on, cook your meat, Ian.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.260
- No, honestly,
you cook your thing.

18:09.398 --> 18:11.435
- No. Go ahead, please.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.511
- Yeah.
OK, the milk is not here.

18:18.925 --> 18:20.754
- Well, maybe
I didn't pack it, then.

18:20.892 --> 18:24.033
- Austin, I put it on the bench
for you to pack specifically.

18:24.172 --> 18:28.383
What are we gonna put on our
muesli in the morning, then?

18:31.489 --> 18:32.973
- Jesus, Ian!

18:33.526 --> 18:34.941
- For...
- Geez.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.701
We need to do something.
Get some water or something!

18:36.839 --> 18:38.565
- You don't put water
on hot oil.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.774
- Yeah, you do.
Water combats fire.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.914
- It'll make it worse.
- Yeah, maybe in Australia.

18:43.052 --> 18:44.468
- Put a lid on it or something.

18:44.606 --> 18:45.848
- Oh, shit. Fuck's sake, Ian.
- Cover the flame.

18:45.986 --> 18:47.781
Suffocate the flame.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.093
Gosh.

18:49.231 --> 18:50.922
My Lord.

18:52.338 --> 18:53.408
Is it out?

18:53.546 --> 18:55.064
- Yeah.
- All right.

18:55.203 --> 18:58.275
- It just smells.
- Open a door or something.

19:06.697 --> 19:08.112
Open the window.
Open the window.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.493
[coughing]

19:09.631 --> 19:12.806
- How do you open
the window in the cabin?

19:12.944 --> 19:14.083
[coughing]

19:14.222 --> 19:15.602
- Open it.

19:15.740 --> 19:16.948
- Well, how do you open
the window in the...?

19:18.226 --> 19:20.262
[tense music]

19:32.067 --> 19:34.414
[panting]

19:48.325 --> 19:50.396
[ominous music]

20:38.858 --> 20:41.032
[music pulsing]

21:05.540 --> 21:07.438
- You all right?

21:08.163 --> 21:09.406
- Yeah.

21:09.544 --> 21:11.442
- Are you leaving us?

21:12.512 --> 21:14.411
- No. Um...

21:14.549 --> 21:16.551
- That's your pack.
- Oh.

21:18.138 --> 21:21.314
Uh, I was just
airing it out. It's...

21:32.912 --> 21:34.707
- What are you looking for?

21:36.467 --> 21:38.504
- I think I just...

21:39.436 --> 21:41.990
saw a... an animal or...

21:42.508 --> 21:44.682
- You got bears around here?

21:45.614 --> 21:47.858
- No. We don't have anything.

21:47.996 --> 21:48.928
- Mm.

21:50.550 --> 21:53.104
I killed a lion
back in Zimbabwe.

21:53.691 --> 21:56.694
It was attacking my dog,
so I killed it with a rock.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.075
It's a protected species,
you know.

21:58.213 --> 22:00.180
And I had to go to
court and... stuff,

22:00.319 --> 22:02.666
but what was I supposed to do?

22:02.804 --> 22:05.324
It was mauling my dog.
- Really?

22:07.671 --> 22:08.948
- There you are.

22:09.086 --> 22:11.088
We've just been cleaning up
your mess, mate.

22:11.226 --> 22:14.333
It's not a very good
hiking etiquette, is it?

23:09.974 --> 23:12.080
- Oh. Ian, doll.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.048
You look terrible.
Did you sleep?

23:15.601 --> 23:17.534
- Yeah.

23:18.673 --> 23:20.778
- Huh. OK.

23:30.478 --> 23:32.928
- Better get a wriggle on if
we wanna walk with these guys.

23:33.066 --> 23:35.414
- Oh, no, no. I--
- You'll be ready in 10, yeah?

23:35.552 --> 23:36.863
- No, no, I'm--
- Listen.

23:37.001 --> 23:39.279
Mr Austin Big Shot
keeps going on and on

23:39.418 --> 23:41.972
about how great he is at hiking.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.629
I doubt he's even that good.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.285
I reckon even you
could outpace him.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.253
- I don't wanna... go with them.

23:47.391 --> 23:49.428
- Before I forget...

23:58.471 --> 24:00.128
For your blisters.

24:00.266 --> 24:04.097
They're thick, so you won't have
all that slipping and sliding.

24:04.891 --> 24:06.375
There you go, mate.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.101
- Thank you.

24:08.239 --> 24:11.242
- No worries, mate. Gotta take
care of those tootsies, eh?

24:11.380 --> 24:13.072
Plus, you can just give 'em
back at the end of the walk,

24:13.210 --> 24:15.246
yeah?
Cos they're a bit expensive.

24:15.384 --> 24:17.490
Cheers.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.343
- When I was a kid, I used
to go fishing with my dad,

24:43.482 --> 24:46.554
and he took me to
South Africa when I was 15,

24:46.692 --> 24:47.969
and I saw a great white.
- Oh.

24:48.107 --> 24:49.798
- You seen a great white before?
- Oh, yeah,

24:49.936 --> 24:51.455
I've seen a few sharks, yeah.
- ...and then I stopped,

24:51.593 --> 24:53.250
and then that was
when he proposed.

24:53.388 --> 24:55.148
Like, right there in the Jeep

24:55.286 --> 24:59.014
withthe herd of elephants
watching. It was...

24:59.152 --> 25:01.016
Oh my God, Ian.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.502
Look at these!

25:04.226 --> 25:07.264
They're like wild African
daisies or something.

25:07.402 --> 25:09.784
Ian, can you take a photo of me?

25:10.163 --> 25:13.132
- Uh, yeah. OK.
- Yeah, perfect. OK.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.168
Now, I'll just do this.

25:16.618 --> 25:17.723
Ian, you should be in it.

25:17.861 --> 25:19.518
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:19.656 --> 25:21.036
Quick, come here. Come on.
- No.

25:21.174 --> 25:22.279
- Come on. Come on. Down here.
- No, no-- Oh...

25:22.417 --> 25:23.763
Oh. Uh...
- Come on.

25:23.901 --> 25:25.385
Come here. Oh my God.
This is gonna be so good.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.456
OK. We'll put that in.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.355
Matchy-matchy. All right.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.460
Arms up. Nice angle.

25:31.599 --> 25:33.152
Beautiful.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.671
All right, now you just have to,
like, keep on pushing that,

25:34.809 --> 25:35.534
cos we're gonna do
heaps of photos...

25:35.672 --> 25:37.156
- OK.

25:37.294 --> 25:38.606
- ...and we'll just do
selection. OK, ready? Go. Go.

25:38.744 --> 25:40.573
Go. Keep going. Keep going.

25:40.711 --> 25:42.920
Keep going.
Keep going, Keep going.

25:43.058 --> 25:44.888
- OK. We should go
and catch up with the others.

25:45.026 --> 25:46.372
- Let's have a look, hey?
Let's have a look.

25:46.510 --> 25:47.856
- Should we go
and catch up with the others?

25:47.994 --> 25:50.721
- Ugh! Ian, they're rubbish.
- Oh.

26:04.528 --> 26:07.427
- We haven't seen
any of your native birds yet.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.498
- Nah, we saw that seagull.

26:09.637 --> 26:11.915
- That's not native, is it?
- Oh.

26:12.053 --> 26:14.020
In any case, we thought
we would've see, like,

26:14.158 --> 26:17.334
hundreds of birds
in the forest by now.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.129
- It's so quiet here.

26:19.267 --> 26:20.199
- Yeah.

26:23.651 --> 26:26.377
- It's the weasels
that get them...

26:28.172 --> 26:29.829
and rats....

26:30.658 --> 26:32.763
and everything, really.

26:32.901 --> 26:35.939
Eats their chicks
and their eggs, too.

26:38.286 --> 26:39.874
- Oh. Hey.

26:40.012 --> 26:42.359
We saw a dead animal
in a tree on our way here.

26:42.497 --> 26:43.567
- Yeah. It was, like,

26:43.705 --> 26:45.189
all furry and that.
- Yeah.

26:45.327 --> 26:48.330
- I have zero idea as to
what it actually was, though.

26:48.468 --> 26:51.575
Ooh! Nicky, should
you be doing that?

26:51.886 --> 26:53.266
- Beautiful.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.130
Aqua. Water.

26:55.268 --> 26:57.236
- Yeah, I know what
"aqua" means.

26:57.374 --> 27:01.654
No, like, we've just read about
the bugs in the water.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.345
- Not gonna get me.
Don't you worry.

27:03.483 --> 27:05.347
Stomach of steel.

27:06.279 --> 27:07.902
- You caught any fish yet,
brother?

27:08.834 --> 27:10.352
- No, I'm not trying
to catch fish.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.699
If I was trying to catch fish,

27:11.837 --> 27:13.390
I'd come up here
with an armful of fish.

27:13.528 --> 27:16.358
- Oh, hey, Ian and I got onto
a really interesting topic

27:16.496 --> 27:18.084
of conversation before.
- Oh, yeah?

27:18.222 --> 27:21.329
- We were talking about types.
- Oh, yeah?

27:21.467 --> 27:24.090
- Well, I was actually
talking about mine.

27:24.228 --> 27:27.266
Um, but, Ian,
you never told me yours.

27:27.818 --> 27:29.440
Well, so go on.

27:29.578 --> 27:31.960
What's your type of woman?

27:33.065 --> 27:35.481
- Oh, I reckon I could
probably guess Ian's.

27:35.619 --> 27:36.724
Someone a bit rough.

27:36.862 --> 27:38.277
Someone to really
be firm with ya.

27:38.415 --> 27:39.899
Am I right? Kind of take
charge of you a little bit.

27:40.037 --> 27:41.245
- No, like, are you married

27:41.383 --> 27:43.903
or maybe got a partner
or something?

27:44.041 --> 27:46.181
- Uh, no. No, I don't.

27:46.319 --> 27:47.873
- No?

27:48.011 --> 27:49.668
But there was something,
wasn't there?

27:49.806 --> 27:53.154
I can kind of pick up on these
kind of things-- little signals.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.121
You weremarried or something?

27:55.259 --> 27:58.746
- Yeah, I was married,
uh, before. I was, yeah.

27:58.884 --> 27:59.919
- Wasmarried?
Well, what happened?

28:00.057 --> 28:01.714
- Oh, Nicky...
- What?

28:01.852 --> 28:03.509
He's all right.

28:03.647 --> 28:04.821
Come on.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.030
- Yeah, we separated.

28:12.173 --> 28:15.763
- Ian. Have you gone on
any other tramps yet?

28:17.799 --> 28:19.801
- Uh, yeah, once or twice.
- Mm-hm?

28:19.939 --> 28:22.597
- Um, I'm gonna...
I've just gotta...

28:22.735 --> 28:24.633
Anyway, I'm gonna...

28:25.117 --> 28:27.188
just go toilet.

28:30.847 --> 28:32.952
- Good one.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.748
- What?
- Oh my God.

28:40.166 --> 28:42.824
[panting]

29:08.436 --> 29:09.368
- OK.

29:10.403 --> 29:11.335
OK.

29:27.386 --> 29:29.043
[ominous music]

29:44.921 --> 29:46.750
- Oh my--
Ian, are you all right?

29:46.888 --> 29:48.269
- Yeah. Why?

29:48.407 --> 29:50.927
- Just you look
pale as fuck, bro.

29:51.065 --> 29:53.481
Must have been a hell of a shit.

29:54.102 --> 29:56.139
- I just saw some blood.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.727
- Gross. Are you OK?

29:59.694 --> 30:01.489
- Yeah. No, it was--
it was something else

30:01.627 --> 30:03.249
that was bleeding.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.562
- Well, what was it?
Did you see what it was?

30:06.874 --> 30:08.220
- No.

30:08.358 --> 30:11.257
- Hey, maybe a weasel
eating a kiwi, right?

30:15.848 --> 30:17.643
- Should we get going?

30:17.781 --> 30:19.818
- Yeah.
- Yep.

30:22.682 --> 30:23.994
- It was so stupid.

30:24.132 --> 30:25.651
I was kicking
my rugby ball around inside.

30:25.789 --> 30:28.343
Of course I knew I wasn't
meant to, all right?

30:28.481 --> 30:30.967
This is one of the periods
where we were staying in a hotel

30:31.105 --> 30:32.692
cos, you know,
Dad had gotten really angry--

30:32.831 --> 30:33.866
Oh, Father. Sorry.

30:34.004 --> 30:35.626
Meant to call him Father.

30:35.764 --> 30:37.387
But we were staying
in a hotel, right?

30:37.525 --> 30:39.354
Because, well,
there was an argument. I dunno.

30:39.492 --> 30:42.530
I don't really remember a lot
of it. I think I was, what, 13?

30:42.668 --> 30:45.671
And, um, yeah, I was kicking
the rugby ball around inside,

30:45.809 --> 30:47.949
and I hit the, uh...

30:48.605 --> 30:51.159
the picture frame,
and it fell down

30:51.297 --> 30:52.609
and smashed into
the glass table.

30:52.747 --> 30:54.576
And then, man, we had to,
you know, pay a bond

30:54.714 --> 30:56.716
to the stupid hotel.

30:56.993 --> 30:58.684
Oh, man. And then my mum...

30:58.822 --> 30:59.650
- Austin?
- Yo.

30:59.788 --> 31:01.169
- Austin.

31:01.307 --> 31:03.344
Can you see that?
- What?

31:04.759 --> 31:06.830
- Can you see--? Look,
can you look down that path?

31:06.968 --> 31:07.900
- Uh...
- Can you see

31:08.038 --> 31:09.488
that black shape that's...?

31:09.626 --> 31:12.042
- Sorry, my man. My eyes
aren't that great. I don't...

31:12.180 --> 31:13.768
What do you see?
- There's a black shape.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.528
Can you see that? It's...
- Uh...

31:15.666 --> 31:17.392
I don't--
- I think it's been, like,

31:17.530 --> 31:19.222
following us for the entire--
- What are we looking at?

31:19.360 --> 31:21.880
- Ian thinks he can see
some kind of dark shape.

31:22.742 --> 31:24.296
- Can you-- Can you see that?

31:24.434 --> 31:26.194
It's just-- Can you see that?

31:26.332 --> 31:28.679
- What is it, like a tramper?

31:29.163 --> 31:30.578
- I don't see anything, bro.

31:30.716 --> 31:32.718
- Yeah, I don't...

31:33.029 --> 31:35.410
I don't see anything either.

31:39.759 --> 31:41.175
- It's probably...

31:41.313 --> 31:43.971
It's probably just a trick
of the light, I think.

31:44.626 --> 31:45.455
- OK.

31:45.593 --> 31:46.939
- Well--
- I think- Let's just...

31:47.077 --> 31:48.458
- Well, no, is--?
- Let's just keep going,

31:48.596 --> 31:50.218
I reckon, guys.
- Is it like an animal, or...?

31:50.356 --> 31:52.531
- Or... like, a pig, maybe?

31:54.015 --> 31:56.845
- Um, yeah, it's probably a pig.
- Oh, it could've been a goat.

31:56.984 --> 31:58.502
Was it a goat?
- Yeah. It...

31:58.640 --> 32:00.297
- Or a deer.
There are deer out here as well.

32:00.435 --> 32:02.058
- Yeah, it's probably
a goat or a deer, I think.

32:02.196 --> 32:04.267
- Ah. There we go. It's one of
those things. Mystery solved.

32:04.405 --> 32:05.682
- Uh, I don't think you think

32:05.820 --> 32:07.580
it looks like
any of those animals, Ian.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.513
- Oh, no, it--
that could have been a...

32:09.651 --> 32:11.170
it could have been
a goat or nothing.

32:11.308 --> 32:12.896
- Yeah, I mean,
they kill goats around here,

32:13.034 --> 32:15.416
so it's probably just a goat.
There are goats around.

32:15.554 --> 32:18.143
- Yeah. Let's just go, guys.
Let's...

32:20.076 --> 32:21.732
- There are goats around.

32:36.644 --> 32:39.958
- Oh, sogood we're
the only ones again.

32:40.579 --> 32:42.132
Honestly, sometimes
I just can't be bothered

32:42.270 --> 32:43.892
being around other people.
Do you know what I mean?

32:44.031 --> 32:46.550
- Uh, I was kind of hoping
there'd be some ladies here.

32:49.864 --> 32:51.245
- Babe, look what I found.
That's what

32:51.383 --> 32:54.041
I was telling you about.
- Nice.

32:56.422 --> 32:58.666
- Someone else is here.
There's some packs.

32:58.804 --> 33:00.702
- Oh.
- Ooh.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.983
- Maybe they've gone down
to the stream or something.

33:05.121 --> 33:09.746
- Ah. Yeah, well, they must be
girls, cos it's purple and pink.

33:09.884 --> 33:11.127
What do you reckon, mate?

33:11.265 --> 33:12.783
- Babe. Mon!

33:12.921 --> 33:15.683
Check it out.
- Whoo-ow!

33:16.373 --> 33:19.273
- Oh! No, no, giz it here!
Giz it here!

33:20.791 --> 33:22.345
There we go.

33:24.588 --> 33:25.589
You ready?
- Yeah.

33:25.727 --> 33:27.039
- Here we go.

33:30.629 --> 33:32.562
- Oh- Oh!

33:38.223 --> 33:40.984
- Hey!

33:41.122 --> 33:43.021
Whoo-hoo!

33:43.883 --> 33:45.816
Ian, mate.

33:47.197 --> 33:49.234
Come and have a boogie, mate.

33:50.131 --> 33:51.857
Hey. Monica...

33:51.995 --> 33:53.893
Monica, she is into me.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.655
She's been flirting up
an absolute storm.

33:56.793 --> 33:58.829
Austin doesn't
seem to give a shit.

34:00.590 --> 34:02.799
Do you reckon they're open?

34:03.317 --> 34:05.112
Like in an open relationship
or something?

34:05.250 --> 34:06.837
Yeah, like, maybe it's like

34:06.975 --> 34:09.150
a wife-swap situation.
- I wouldn't... I wouldn't know.

34:09.288 --> 34:10.979
- Or maybe like a...

34:11.118 --> 34:12.153
uh, cuckolding.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.362
A "cuckolling." You know.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.432
Oh...

34:17.952 --> 34:19.747
Oh, well. Come on.

34:19.885 --> 34:21.438
Come and have a dance.

34:21.576 --> 34:22.474
Oh-oh-oh!

34:22.612 --> 34:24.683
Nicky's back!
- Hey!

34:24.821 --> 34:26.823
- You've got five more minutes.
- Come here.

34:26.961 --> 34:28.238
- Five.

34:29.032 --> 34:30.792
[eerie music]

35:33.096 --> 35:34.339
- Sorry.

35:34.477 --> 35:36.893
Sorry.
I should have said something.

35:37.031 --> 35:38.377
I didn't wanna scare you,

35:38.515 --> 35:41.000
but I guess the torch
is pretty scary, too.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.244
What's going on?

35:48.801 --> 35:50.009
Ian.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.219
- Yeah. What?

35:53.944 --> 35:55.567
- What's up?

35:57.293 --> 35:58.604
- What do you mean?

35:58.742 --> 36:01.159
- What do you mean,
what do I mean?

36:01.297 --> 36:03.368
You don't seem to sleep.

36:03.989 --> 36:05.853
You're all... edgy.

36:05.991 --> 36:10.168
You know, your whole vibe.
Your whole vibe is just so...

36:10.754 --> 36:12.377
[grunting]

36:14.586 --> 36:16.967
Do you want some sleeping pills?

36:17.485 --> 36:19.349
I've got some.

36:20.039 --> 36:21.938
They'll help.

36:22.076 --> 36:23.974
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:35.572 --> 36:37.609
These are great, mate.

36:38.368 --> 36:40.888
Honestly, they'll knock you out.

36:45.064 --> 36:46.204
There you go.

36:46.342 --> 36:47.791
Just take one.

36:47.929 --> 36:49.552
Yeah, one's plenty.

36:57.456 --> 36:58.975
[exhales, stomach rumbles]

36:59.113 --> 37:01.495
Oh, I've got a bit of
a dicky tummy for some reason.

37:08.950 --> 37:10.849
Ah. That's better.

37:16.372 --> 37:19.996
You having trouble switching
the old brain off as well, huh?

37:20.721 --> 37:23.241
Yeah, I know what that's like.

37:24.138 --> 37:26.036
What's on your mind?

37:27.141 --> 37:28.660
Actually, no,
you don't have to tell me.

37:28.798 --> 37:30.317
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

37:30.455 --> 37:32.388
Prying.

37:38.117 --> 37:40.016
- I'm just so tired.

37:42.087 --> 37:43.985
And I can't sleep.

37:47.403 --> 37:48.611
Sorry.

37:49.128 --> 37:50.509
Sorry.

37:50.647 --> 37:52.718
You don't need to...

37:53.512 --> 37:56.895
...hear my problems.
- No, don't say sorry.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.521
- I just wanted some quiet.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.664
But it's so quiet out here...

38:09.597 --> 38:12.324
that all I can hear
is my brain...

38:14.499 --> 38:18.606
turning over every fuckin' thing
I've done wrong.

38:21.022 --> 38:25.372
All the fuck-ups I made
because I'm so fuckin' weak.

38:27.374 --> 38:30.100
- What makes you
think you're weak?

38:30.515 --> 38:32.586
- I just am.

38:38.177 --> 38:39.178
Sorry.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.284
- No, you're all right.

38:42.009 --> 38:45.737
- I might just grab a water
and... and go to sleep.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.255
- Yeah, OK.

38:47.394 --> 38:49.085
Yeah, me too.

38:49.223 --> 38:51.329
Me too.

38:51.881 --> 38:53.814
- Thank you.

38:55.574 --> 38:57.611
- You're all right.

39:04.618 --> 39:06.482
[distant thud]

39:27.744 --> 39:29.815
[eerie music]

40:22.143 --> 40:23.559
[camera jingles]

40:52.553 --> 40:54.969
[ominous music]

41:30.591 --> 41:32.731
[nervous breathing]

41:40.152 --> 41:42.741
- [Nicky] Honestly,
they'll knock you out.

41:43.604 --> 41:45.572
Just take them.

41:45.917 --> 41:47.953
Yeah, one's plenty.

42:21.884 --> 42:24.265
- Oh, good morning, sleepyhead.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.787
How did you end up on the floor?

42:29.892 --> 42:32.239
- Nicky gave me a sleeping pill.

42:32.377 --> 42:35.932
- Well, it must have
knocked you right out.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.935
- Where is Nicky?

42:39.073 --> 42:42.318
- Oh, him and Austin
are outside trying to catch fish

42:42.456 --> 42:45.908
with their bare hands.
It's so fucked up.

42:50.982 --> 42:52.880
- I have to show you something.

42:53.087 --> 42:54.572
- Yeah?

43:00.681 --> 43:02.787
- Who put the... packs back?

43:03.339 --> 43:05.237
- What do you mean?

43:06.135 --> 43:07.239
Ian?

43:07.377 --> 43:09.276
Ian, doll,
you shouldn't be doing that.

43:09.414 --> 43:10.933
Ian!

43:17.595 --> 43:19.527
- There's a photo
of Nicky on here.

43:19.666 --> 43:20.908
- So?

43:21.529 --> 43:23.255
- So he must have done
something with them!

43:23.393 --> 43:24.636
Tothem.

43:24.774 --> 43:26.396
- Who?
- These girls!

43:26.534 --> 43:28.191
- Oh!

43:28.329 --> 43:29.572
So good.

43:29.710 --> 43:31.056
- Well, there weren't even
any bloody fish in there,

43:31.194 --> 43:32.748
so that was
a complete waste of time.

43:32.886 --> 43:35.129
Hey! Finally awake, boyo.

43:35.509 --> 43:37.338
- Who put these packs back?

43:38.961 --> 43:41.722
- I did. And I put a sleeping
bag over you, too.

43:41.860 --> 43:44.000
You would've bloody frozen
out here. I could've lifted you

43:44.138 --> 43:45.657
into the bunk, but...
I didn't really have the time.

43:45.795 --> 43:46.727
I didn't wanna wake you guys up.

43:46.865 --> 43:49.005
- Where are they?

43:49.281 --> 43:50.593
- Where are what?

43:50.731 --> 43:52.837
- The girls.

43:52.975 --> 43:55.563
- What girls?
- These girls with the-the...

43:55.702 --> 43:56.979
who own the packs.

43:57.117 --> 43:59.740
You're in one of their photos!

44:00.603 --> 44:01.915
- Am I?
- Yes.

44:02.053 --> 44:04.055
- OK. Give us a look.

44:04.193 --> 44:05.781
Show us.

44:05.919 --> 44:07.679
- The battery's dead.

44:07.817 --> 44:09.370
- Wait. I was in
one of their photos?

44:09.508 --> 44:11.338
- Yes.

44:11.476 --> 44:13.271
You were looking at them.

44:15.825 --> 44:18.656
- Um, I don't know
what he's talking about.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.661
- He killed them.
- Whoa. OK.

44:23.799 --> 44:25.352
Hold up, hold up, hold up. OK.

44:25.490 --> 44:27.872
Obviously, this is some
kind of misunderstanding.

44:28.010 --> 44:29.977
I mean, come on.

44:30.115 --> 44:31.910
- Well, why are their packs
still here and they're not here?

44:32.048 --> 44:33.498
Where are they?!
- They probably just

44:33.636 --> 44:35.293
left them here while
they went on a day trip.

44:35.431 --> 44:37.951
- It'd be really good if we
could see the photo, Ian.

44:38.089 --> 44:41.161
It could be a trick of the lens
or something.

44:41.299 --> 44:42.990
- And he drugged me.
- What?

44:43.128 --> 44:44.578
- You drugged me last night.

44:44.716 --> 44:47.443
- You said you needed a sleeping
pill. You couldn't sleep.

44:47.581 --> 44:50.135
- Yeah, well,
no sleeping pill's that strong.

44:50.273 --> 44:53.138
- Ian, you might have
a sensitive constitution

44:53.276 --> 44:55.831
or something.
- Yeah, obviously.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.730
- No-- Well, why...?

44:59.179 --> 45:00.905
You were still in--
Why--? When you were...

45:01.043 --> 45:02.976
- What are you trying to say?!

45:03.114 --> 45:04.356
- You were in front of me.

45:04.494 --> 45:05.668
But when you met me--
when I met you,

45:05.806 --> 45:08.153
you were coming up from behind.

45:08.775 --> 45:11.467
- Well, I had to go back.
I went back to the car park.

45:11.605 --> 45:13.503
- Hang on. What for?

45:15.851 --> 45:18.060
- I had to get something
from my car.

45:18.198 --> 45:21.235
- Hold up.
So you went back to your car?

45:22.512 --> 45:25.308
- Yeah, that's why
I ended up behind Ian.

45:25.446 --> 45:27.000
- Well, why didn't
we cross paths, then?

45:27.138 --> 45:28.933
Why didn't I cross you?
- Uh...

45:29.071 --> 45:32.246
- Wait, so you were
in the photos?

45:33.144 --> 45:35.215
Do you know the girls?
- No. No. You guys are

45:35.353 --> 45:37.320
the first people that I've seen
on this whole walk.

45:37.458 --> 45:38.839
- Well, why didn't
we cross paths

45:38.977 --> 45:40.599
when you went back
to the car park?

45:40.738 --> 45:43.292
- I don't know, Ian! You were
off the path for some reason.

45:43.430 --> 45:44.603
Hiding or something.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.159
Look, I didn't murder
any fucking girls, OK!

45:51.749 --> 45:52.888
- Hungry?
- Oh my God,

45:53.026 --> 45:54.890
I'm dying for a proper coffee.

45:55.028 --> 45:57.064
And I need a proper shit.

45:57.962 --> 45:59.066
Hello.

46:08.110 --> 46:10.837
- How far away was it?
- Like, 10km up.

46:10.975 --> 46:12.666
- Yeah, there were
no signs or anything.

46:12.804 --> 46:14.564
- And we thought
we saw something,

46:14.702 --> 46:17.567
but... they were probably
just bones from anywhere.

46:17.705 --> 46:19.362
- But where did you guys sleep,
though, last night?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.054
- In one of the caves.

46:21.192 --> 46:23.608
- Shit.
- Uh, we're hard-out.

46:24.195 --> 46:26.300
- So how did you know
about the bones?

46:26.438 --> 46:28.268
- Well, it pays to date
a paleontologist.

46:28.406 --> 46:30.063
- Uh, we weren't even dating.

46:30.201 --> 46:32.479
Anyway, he said there were
moa bones around here.

46:32.617 --> 46:34.826
And then he showed me
how to find the cave.

46:34.964 --> 46:37.173
Talia's got some photos
on her phone.

46:37.311 --> 46:38.485
Honestly, it's all
you need to see.

46:38.623 --> 46:39.555
- Cool.

46:42.972 --> 46:45.492
- Is... that my camera?

46:48.012 --> 46:49.599
- Oh, look,

46:49.737 --> 46:51.636
we were just, like,
trying to figure out

46:51.774 --> 46:54.259
where you girls were
last night. That's it.

46:54.397 --> 46:56.330
- I'm sorry.

47:03.372 --> 47:05.477
- This was charged before.

47:06.927 --> 47:08.998
- Do you know him?

47:10.758 --> 47:13.244
- Apparently,
I'm in one of your photos.

47:13.382 --> 47:15.487
- How do you know
what photos were on there?

47:19.112 --> 47:21.217
- Uh-- Oh.

47:22.701 --> 47:23.910
- Ian...

47:24.048 --> 47:26.464
Ian hasn't been
sleeping very well.

47:26.602 --> 47:28.500
Have you, doll?

47:30.882 --> 47:32.746
- We were trying to work out
where you were.

47:32.884 --> 47:35.231
We were worried. That's all.

47:37.371 --> 47:40.029
- You guys gonna check out
the Kauri forest?

47:40.167 --> 47:42.066
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

47:42.204 --> 47:44.620
- It's pretty amazing.
- Oh my God.

47:44.758 --> 47:46.553
- Fuck! Looks awesome.

47:54.975 --> 47:57.460
[breathing heavily]

48:19.310 --> 48:21.484
- So have you done
anything in Aussie, or...?

48:21.622 --> 48:23.452
- Yeah, I lived there
for like five years.

48:23.590 --> 48:26.662
I did the Crocodile Hungee trek.
- Hey!

48:26.800 --> 48:28.526
- Yeah, have you done that?
- Uh, no.

48:28.664 --> 48:30.045
I heard about it, though.
- Yeah, we haven't done that.

48:30.183 --> 48:31.667
- It's a 21-day trek.

48:31.805 --> 48:33.772
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

48:34.428 --> 48:37.638
- Um, do you pay for it?
- Yeah. It's, like...

48:37.776 --> 48:39.261
- Milford, tick.

48:39.399 --> 48:43.058
Tongariro, tick. Easy.
Couple of times a year, maybe.

48:43.196 --> 48:45.198
Gave myself 20 minutes
to catch up with him,

48:45.336 --> 48:46.647
caught him in about five.

48:46.785 --> 48:50.203
I always catch everyone
I have my eye on.

48:50.789 --> 48:52.515
- Nicky, could I have a word?

48:52.653 --> 48:54.034
- Uh...

48:54.172 --> 48:55.622
I'll just...

48:55.760 --> 48:57.658
- See you soon.

49:00.661 --> 49:04.079
- Um, Nicky, I just wanted to,
um... I just wanted to apologies

49:04.217 --> 49:06.150
just about before.

49:06.288 --> 49:08.393
I just-- My mind just went...

49:08.531 --> 49:10.568
My mind just always goes to
the worst possible scenario.

49:10.706 --> 49:14.434
And I'm sorry that you
got caught up in that.

49:14.572 --> 49:18.507
I shouldn't have gone
into their bags. What a...

49:18.645 --> 49:21.579
I'm so stupid.
I'm so sorry, Nicky.

49:27.205 --> 49:30.070
- Bro, it's actually
totally fine.

49:31.313 --> 49:33.384
- Really?
- Yes.

49:33.798 --> 49:35.558
Ya noob.

49:36.490 --> 49:40.874
I know you haven't been getting
much sleep lately, and...

49:41.012 --> 49:43.325
I know what that
can do to a person.

49:43.463 --> 49:45.396
- Yeah.

49:46.190 --> 49:48.468
- You thought I was a killer.

49:50.263 --> 49:52.403
- Argh!
- [gasps]

49:56.545 --> 50:00.204
Plus, I'm in too good a mood
to be angry today.

50:00.618 --> 50:04.346
I'm catching quite a vibe
from this Talia girl.

50:05.588 --> 50:08.177
- We've already been,
but, um, you-- you go.

50:08.315 --> 50:10.524
You'll have so much fun
by yourself.

50:10.662 --> 50:12.975
- Yeah, nah, I reckon the
whole squad should go.

50:13.113 --> 50:14.942
It'll be fun, the whole team
all together again.

50:15.081 --> 50:16.289
Like a whole crew.

50:16.427 --> 50:17.255
- We've kind of already
made plans.

50:17.393 --> 50:19.430
- Like joining forces.

50:19.568 --> 50:21.190
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

50:21.328 --> 50:23.399
- Hey, guys.
- Mm?

50:24.883 --> 50:26.126
- I just wanted to apologize

50:26.264 --> 50:29.129
about... just before--
- Oh, Ian, stop.

50:29.267 --> 50:30.786
It's funny.

50:30.924 --> 50:32.753
- I thought he murdered them,
though. It's so...

50:32.891 --> 50:34.479
It's so stupid.

50:34.617 --> 50:37.517
- Yeah, but I would've come
to the exact same conclusion.

50:37.655 --> 50:39.864
I'm paranoid as hell. Hey, babe?
- Mm. Seriously, dude.

50:40.002 --> 50:41.590
She thought our neighbor
had a secret family

50:41.728 --> 50:44.420
hidden in the attic.
- Yeah. I still maintain he did,

50:44.558 --> 50:47.113
cos he's a psychopath
and a creep. So, we're off.

50:47.251 --> 50:48.390
Come on.

50:50.150 --> 50:52.221
Ian. Up.

50:56.605 --> 50:58.262
- Yeah. It looks like you guys
are heading off anyway.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.746
- Aw!
- Are we?

50:59.884 --> 51:01.575
- What a shame.

51:04.130 --> 51:06.787
- But one of the guys tries
to jump over a creek,

51:06.925 --> 51:08.375
and he slips!

51:08.513 --> 51:11.758
His ankle jams, like,
right in between two rocks.

51:11.896 --> 51:14.105
But his weight pulls him over--
crack, crack, crack!

51:14.243 --> 51:15.693
All the bones
go through the skin.

51:16.452 --> 51:17.798
Blood everywhere.
All down the stream,

51:17.936 --> 51:19.524
little ribbons of red blood.

51:19.662 --> 51:22.182
His friend faints immediately,
of course, scared of blood.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.942
So I have to jump in.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.082
I have to run to get help.

51:25.220 --> 51:27.153
So I run about 20, 30...

51:27.532 --> 51:29.362
actually, probably 50km.

51:29.500 --> 51:30.846
It's a good thing I was so fit
at the time, actually.

51:30.984 --> 51:33.297
I was, uh, training
for a marathon.

51:33.435 --> 51:34.712
All right.
We going to the Kauri forest?

51:34.850 --> 51:36.127
- Yeah. Uh, actually,

51:36.265 --> 51:38.785
we thought that we'd
check out the waterfall.

51:38.923 --> 51:40.890
- What?! No, no, no, no, no.

51:41.028 --> 51:42.340
Kauri forest. This is, like,

51:42.478 --> 51:43.859
the whole reason I came
on the whole trip.

51:43.997 --> 51:45.274
- Yeah, well, you two can go,

51:45.412 --> 51:47.173
and we'll just meet you
at the next hut.

51:47.311 --> 51:49.934
- We can go to the-- We'll go
to the waterfall with you.

51:50.072 --> 51:51.246
We go to the waterfall?

51:51.384 --> 51:52.661
- No, I wanna go to
the Kauri forest.

51:52.799 --> 51:54.318
Apparently,
it's meant to be beautiful.

51:54.456 --> 51:56.492
- Yeah, well,
you two can go to the forest,

51:56.630 --> 51:59.461
and we'll, um,
meet you at the next hut.

52:01.842 --> 52:03.327
- OK. Yeah. We'll see you
there, you guys.

52:03.465 --> 52:05.018
Let's go, Nicky.
- Bye, Nicky.

52:05.156 --> 52:06.123
- Bye, guys.
- 'K,

52:06.261 --> 52:06.985
you're making a huge mistake.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.229
- Bye, Ian!

52:10.679 --> 52:12.922
- Aw, maybe we should
just go to the waterfall.

52:13.060 --> 52:15.339
- I think they wanna be alone.

52:15.477 --> 52:18.342
- What? Why would they
wanna be alone?

52:30.457 --> 52:32.666
What, you think
they're gonna have sex?

52:33.598 --> 52:35.876
Of course they fuckin' are.

52:40.433 --> 52:41.951
It just doesn't make any sense.

52:42.089 --> 52:45.058
I mean, cos the next guy she was
with, they end up engaged.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.647
And, I mean--
And it happened like that.

52:47.785 --> 52:48.993
Which happened to
the last girl I was with

52:49.131 --> 52:50.650
before her as well.

52:50.788 --> 52:52.824
I mean, it just doesn't
make any sense.

52:52.962 --> 52:54.654
You talk about you having
a breakdown, but,

52:54.792 --> 52:57.277
I mean, thatwas a breakdown.

53:00.522 --> 53:03.041
- Hold on.
Where's the path gone?

53:03.180 --> 53:05.596
- Well, the sun is there, so...

53:06.769 --> 53:08.254
Come on.

53:09.186 --> 53:12.430
And Mum, she got pregnant
with me when she was about 15,

53:12.568 --> 53:14.501
so she couldn't really
leave him, you know?

53:14.639 --> 53:17.504
Well, she could have,
but... I don't know.

53:17.884 --> 53:19.817
[panting]

53:22.129 --> 53:24.408
- This is definitely
not the path, Nicky.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.755
- No, yeah, it is. It is.

53:26.893 --> 53:29.206
It is. It--
It goes from there, and it...

53:29.344 --> 53:31.587
- See, I don't even think that
was the path that we came up.

53:31.725 --> 53:33.520
I don't...

53:33.658 --> 53:36.420
- No, no.
That's definitely the path.

53:36.558 --> 53:38.007
- Look, I think we
go back to the fork

53:38.145 --> 53:39.561
where the waterfall--
you know, go- and then we go via

53:39.699 --> 53:40.872
the waterfall,
and we just go that way.

53:41.010 --> 53:43.047
- No, we've been walking
hours since then.

53:43.185 --> 53:47.258
No, no, no. This is it.
This is definitely the-- Hey.

53:47.396 --> 53:50.572
Feeling lost, mate?
Just go straight.

53:50.710 --> 53:51.642
Yeah?

53:53.195 --> 53:54.300
- OK.

53:57.820 --> 53:58.752
Nicky.

54:00.513 --> 54:02.756
Nicky, this isn't the path.

54:03.619 --> 54:06.864
- Yeah, it's obviously
not the path, Ian.

54:07.761 --> 54:10.868
OK? You were right,
and Nicky was wrong.

54:11.006 --> 54:12.801
We're just gonna have to
sleep in my pup tent.

54:12.939 --> 54:15.113
- No, we can't do that. I don't
wanna stay outside tonight.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.494
- Yeah? What would you rather?

54:16.632 --> 54:18.289
Should we just walk
through the night?

54:18.427 --> 54:19.394
- No.
- No.

54:19.532 --> 54:20.809
OK. Yeah?
So we'll just--

54:20.947 --> 54:21.948
we'll make it
to the bottom of the hill.

54:22.086 --> 54:22.811
OK? At least.

54:22.949 --> 54:23.950
- Hey, watch out!

54:24.088 --> 54:25.676
Oh my God! Oh my God.

54:25.814 --> 54:27.367
Are you all right?
- Ah!

54:27.505 --> 54:28.817
What the fuck is that?!
- It's all right. 'S all right.

54:28.955 --> 54:30.612
- It's a--
It's one... It's a trap.

54:30.750 --> 54:32.303
They've been trying to
trap goats, apparently.

54:32.441 --> 54:33.649
- Goats?
- Yeah.

54:33.787 --> 54:34.719
- What, in this big
fuckin' thing?!

54:34.857 --> 54:36.687
- No, no-
- Ah, shit!

54:36.825 --> 54:37.998
Ah, shit!

54:38.136 --> 54:40.069
- It's all right.

54:40.380 --> 54:41.381
It's all right.

54:41.519 --> 54:43.176
It's only me, OK?

54:43.314 --> 54:45.247
- Oh.

54:45.385 --> 54:46.904
Toilet break.
- What?

54:47.042 --> 54:49.044
- Urgent toilet break.
Sorry. Two seconds.

54:49.182 --> 54:51.426
- Watch out for traps, though.
Watch out...

55:04.887 --> 55:06.579
- Ian, you're gonna
have to speed up.

55:06.717 --> 55:08.132
The sun is starting to set.
- I know that, Nicky.

55:08.270 --> 55:11.031
I just don't wanna
stand on any hidden traps.

55:12.239 --> 55:13.448
- Oh, shit.

55:13.586 --> 55:14.656
- What?
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

55:14.794 --> 55:16.140
- What?

55:16.278 --> 55:18.591
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse the pun and excuse me.

55:18.729 --> 55:20.213
- OK.
- Oh!

55:20.351 --> 55:22.422
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

55:22.905 --> 55:24.286
Oh!

55:24.424 --> 55:25.943
Whoo!

55:32.156 --> 55:34.434
[ominous music]

56:00.495 --> 56:02.359
- Nicky?

56:05.569 --> 56:07.191
Nicky.

56:07.329 --> 56:08.710
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

56:08.848 --> 56:11.126
- You good?
- Yeah, let's go.

56:11.264 --> 56:13.439
Barely touched the sides.

56:14.957 --> 56:17.581
Oh, God, now we're going fast.

56:18.340 --> 56:19.583
- Nicky.

56:21.999 --> 56:24.208
Do you ever feel like
you're being watched?

56:24.933 --> 56:27.211
- What, by the government?
- No.

56:27.349 --> 56:29.213
By something in the trees.

56:29.351 --> 56:30.594
- No.

56:33.769 --> 56:35.357
- You don't feel that?

56:35.495 --> 56:36.738
- Feel...? Feel...?

56:36.876 --> 56:39.257
No, I don't feel anything, Ian.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.432
There's nothing here.

56:41.570 --> 56:43.986
Honestly, there's nothing here.

56:44.124 --> 56:45.160
- OK.

56:45.298 --> 56:47.024
- Wait. Hold on. Wait.

56:47.162 --> 56:48.957
- What?

56:49.095 --> 56:51.408
- Can you hear that?
- What?

56:54.134 --> 56:55.239
- The waterfall!

56:55.377 --> 56:57.448
Ian, the waterfall!

57:02.004 --> 57:03.385
Ha ha ha!

57:03.523 --> 57:05.076
He-he-hey!

57:05.214 --> 57:06.146
Yes!

57:06.284 --> 57:08.183
Ian! We made it!

57:08.494 --> 57:10.081
We made it, Ian!

57:10.219 --> 57:12.118
We made it!

57:14.085 --> 57:15.086
[laughs]

57:15.224 --> 57:16.674
I told you,
you didn't have to worry.

57:16.812 --> 57:18.849
I told you.
- Oh.

57:19.332 --> 57:20.609
Oh.

57:25.442 --> 57:26.891
- Ah.

57:31.344 --> 57:33.415
- It's getting pretty dark,
though.

57:33.553 --> 57:35.417
Should we...

57:35.555 --> 57:37.626
keep going?

57:38.316 --> 57:40.249
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

57:40.767 --> 57:43.252
It's beautiful, though, so...

57:44.115 --> 57:45.807
- Yes!

58:09.624 --> 58:11.764
[shallow breathing]

58:13.075 --> 58:14.836
What's wrong?

58:17.045 --> 58:19.496
Ian, what's wrong?
- I don't...

58:19.634 --> 58:21.428
I don't-- I don't wanna...

58:21.567 --> 58:23.327
I don't wanna go in there.

58:23.810 --> 58:26.088
- In here? But it's the path.

58:27.469 --> 58:29.540
- Yeah. No, Nicky...

58:29.678 --> 58:31.197
- Come on, let's keep moving.

58:31.335 --> 58:34.580
You were just in the trees
with no path, and you were fine.

58:35.857 --> 58:39.446
- Look, I know I-I seem
really on edge, but...

58:40.206 --> 58:42.208
I've just got this feeling that
something really, really bad

58:42.346 --> 58:43.692
is about to happen.

58:43.830 --> 58:46.695
And it feels really
strong right now.

58:48.352 --> 58:51.044
- Ian, you always
have that feeling,

58:51.182 --> 58:54.531
even when there's
nothing to worry about.

58:55.877 --> 58:57.982
Do you have a torch?
- No.

58:59.190 --> 59:02.573
- Well, lucky for you,
Mr Sensible got us covered.

59:02.711 --> 59:04.195
- Look, I know
you think I'm stupid,

59:04.333 --> 59:06.681
but I think something was
following us before, and I...

59:06.819 --> 59:09.891
and I feel like it's gonna be
in the trees waiting for us.

59:10.029 --> 59:12.065
It's...
- The thing from the other day?

59:12.203 --> 59:13.895
The pig goat?

59:15.379 --> 59:17.968
Let's do this.
You take the torch.

59:18.106 --> 59:20.936
Come on.
You got this. Let's do it.

59:24.664 --> 59:26.183
[light clicks]

59:28.116 --> 59:29.462
- OK.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.843
- OK?
- Yeah-- Yeah.

59:30.981 --> 59:32.361
Let's go really fast. Can we?
- Yeah.

59:32.499 --> 59:33.777
- OK.

59:57.386 --> 59:59.285
- Fuck, it is kind of creepy.
I can see what you mean now.

59:59.423 --> 01:00:01.356
- Don't say that.
- Sorry.

01:00:02.184 --> 01:00:04.117
- Ooh, fuck!

01:00:04.842 --> 01:00:06.741
- Ian!
- Shit.

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.812
- Ian.
- Shit.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:10.537
Oh my God. Let's run.
- What?

01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:12.125
- Let's run.
- No, no, no! Come on.

01:00:12.263 --> 01:00:15.784
Come on. You've gotta get it.
- What? But it's...

01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:18.338
But it's...
all the way down there.

01:00:18.476 --> 01:00:20.340
- Yeah, it's down there because
you dropped it down there.

01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:22.308
Go and get it.

01:00:22.929 --> 01:00:25.380
- Oh my... No, I can't. I can't.

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:29.280
- Ian, that cost me $300,
that torch.

01:00:31.524 --> 01:00:33.422
- A torch cost you $300?

01:00:34.354 --> 01:00:36.115
- Yeah.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:37.841
Gotta grab it.
We kind of need it.

01:00:37.979 --> 01:00:39.808
- Oh, fuck.

01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:41.292
Can you come with me?

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.915
- What? No. Come on.
It can't have gone far.

01:00:43.053 --> 01:00:45.780
You'll be fine.
Just go. Come on.

01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:48.161
- Fuck.

01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:49.784
Please, let's just go.

01:00:49.922 --> 01:00:51.406
Let's just--
- Ian.

01:00:51.544 --> 01:00:52.821
No.

01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:56.273
- Fuck!

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:58.655
Oh, shit. Yeah, OK.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:00.726
Shit. OK. Yep.

01:01:00.864 --> 01:01:02.935
Yep. OK.

01:01:03.383 --> 01:01:05.144
Oh, shit.

01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:57.955
[ominous music]

01:02:17.423 --> 01:02:19.356
Ah!

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:22.462
Ah!

01:02:30.574 --> 01:02:32.058
Oh my God! Oh, shit.

01:02:32.196 --> 01:02:33.370
Something was chasing me.

01:02:33.508 --> 01:02:34.958
- Was that you screaming?
- Where's Nicky?

01:02:35.096 --> 01:02:36.649
- Well, who was chasing you?
- Oh, yes!

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.409
- Ah!
- Ian, there you are.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.032
- What are you--? What--?
- You were screaming,

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.205
and we were trying to find you.

01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:42.862
- Did you find my torch?
- Ah!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.864
- Ah! What's going on?

01:02:45.002 --> 01:02:47.039
- It's-- Did you see it?!

01:02:48.074 --> 01:02:50.628
- See what?
- The thing that was chasing me.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.940
- No.

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:55.426
- But it was just down there.
You were just-- Where--?

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:59.085
It was where you were.
- I didn't see anything.

01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:01.329
- Did you hear it, though?

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.954
- The only thing I heard
was you screaming.

01:03:11.649 --> 01:03:13.375
Was it you?
- What?

01:03:13.513 --> 01:03:14.480
- Was it...?

01:03:14.618 --> 01:03:16.965
Was it you chasing me?!
- What?

01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:28.425
- [whispering] He snatched
the torch off me

01:03:28.563 --> 01:03:30.876
cos he thought something
was actually following him.

01:03:31.014 --> 01:03:32.532
- Yeah, that's
what he was saying

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.534
right before we ran
into you guys.

01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:36.813
"There's something after me.
There's something after me."

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:38.573
- So there's definitely nothing

01:03:38.711 --> 01:03:40.575
that could've been
chasing him in the bush?

01:03:40.713 --> 01:03:42.715
- No. No, it's New Zealand.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.372
I mean, there's nothing around.

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.512
Maybe a pig. Maybe.

01:03:47.168 --> 01:03:49.170
- You know, we've really--
we've gotta get him home.

01:03:49.308 --> 01:03:52.242
- I agree. I mean,
he's not even sleeping.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.624
- You guys can't take him.
You're on your honeymoon.

01:03:55.762 --> 01:03:58.420
So, what, I'm gonna have to
fall on the grenade, am I?

01:03:58.558 --> 01:03:59.870
- Is that OK?

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:01.976
I'm sorry.
- Let's do it.

01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:03.701
Let's do it. Let's do it.
- Oh, man.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.876
- Fuck's sake. OK.

01:04:14.126 --> 01:04:15.541
[light knocking]

01:04:17.784 --> 01:04:19.614
Hey, buddy.

01:04:19.752 --> 01:04:21.271
Um...

01:04:21.409 --> 01:04:22.720
Hey, this, uh...

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.206
this... the thing you saw...

01:04:26.172 --> 01:04:29.037
- Yeah, can you
explain that again?

01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:32.247
- I'm not making it up.

01:04:32.385 --> 01:04:34.042
- We're not saying
you're making it up.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.665
- Yeah, no one's saying that.
- Yeah.

01:04:36.803 --> 01:04:39.013
Um, it was as big as a man?

01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.981
- And it was... hairy?

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.122
Yeah?

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.262
- I don't know. I...

01:04:48.056 --> 01:04:50.369
I only saw it in the shadows.

01:04:50.783 --> 01:04:52.336
- OK. But, I mean,

01:04:52.474 --> 01:04:55.063
you- you thought it was Austin
for a second there, right?

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:58.411
You thought he--
he might be chasing you?

01:04:59.654 --> 01:05:01.518
- I don't know. I...

01:05:01.863 --> 01:05:03.934
I was just--
I wasn't thinking straight.

01:05:04.072 --> 01:05:06.523
- You weren't thinking
straight, Ian?

01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.181
- I was thinking straight.
I just wasn't...

01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:11.769
I wasn't sure
what was chasing me.

01:05:12.425 --> 01:05:14.117
- So it's kind of like
when you said

01:05:14.255 --> 01:05:16.464
that Nicky killed those girls?

01:05:16.602 --> 01:05:20.537
- It's just we don't have
any animals that size here.

01:05:20.675 --> 01:05:22.263
D'you know what I mean?

01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:25.162
- It could be, like...
I don't know, um,

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.199
when you're...

01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:28.683
on edge.
- Yeah.

01:05:28.821 --> 01:05:30.581
- Yeah? Cos you haven't
been sleeping very much.

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:32.135
- And it's hard to
sleep out here.

01:05:32.273 --> 01:05:34.309
- Yeah. It's...

01:05:34.447 --> 01:05:38.693
Things can seem, like, way
bigger than they actually are.

01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:40.695
- Totally. And, you know,

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:43.077
sometimes they're not
even there, maybe.

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:44.975
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:45.113 --> 01:05:47.978
- Would that be fair...
to say, Ian?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.161
Um, Ian, we've had a chat.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.611
And, like, um, by no means
are we trying to, like,

01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:03.683
make decisions
for you, Ian, but...

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:05.720
And, um, we thought...

01:06:05.858 --> 01:06:08.136
Actually, Nicky thought...

01:06:08.274 --> 01:06:10.380
Didn't you? You thought...

01:06:10.518 --> 01:06:12.244
- Yeah. You know what, bro?

01:06:12.382 --> 01:06:13.900
You know what I reckon we do?

01:06:14.039 --> 01:06:17.007
I reckon me and you get up
early, like crack of dawn, yeah?

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:19.458
And we just--
we just rip it out, man.

01:06:19.596 --> 01:06:21.149
All day. We just walk for it.

01:06:21.287 --> 01:06:23.393
We get to the last hut
around mid-afternoon...

01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:24.842
- Yeah.
- ...but we keep going.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.154
- Keep going.
- Yeah.

01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:27.845
We'll get all the way
to the car park.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.054
- And when you're
at the car park,

01:06:29.192 --> 01:06:30.745
you're gonna be in range. Yeah?

01:06:30.883 --> 01:06:32.643
- And so Nicky, or you,

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:34.887
could call someone
to come pick you up

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:36.337
and, you know, look after ya.

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:38.649
- Anyone. Anyone you need.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.450
[eerie music builds]

01:07:36.638 --> 01:07:38.502
[birds chirping]

01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:50.273
You all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:52.551
- We're making good time, so...

01:07:52.689 --> 01:07:54.242
how about we stop
and take a break

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.210
for a bite to eat,
drink of water or something

01:07:56.348 --> 01:07:58.177
in about five minutes?

01:07:58.315 --> 01:07:59.937
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.043
- Yes.
- Yeah. OK.

01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:04.632
Break in five minutes.
We're almost there.

01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:10.500
- Oh, for shit's sakes.

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:32.970
I'm so sorry that you have
to look after me, Nicky.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.180
It's so humiliating.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.320
- Look after ya?

01:08:37.458 --> 01:08:38.252
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.081
I just need to get back.

01:08:40.219 --> 01:08:43.222
So this all--
this all works out well.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.165
- Am I crazy?
- What?

01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:57.340
No.

01:08:58.237 --> 01:08:59.618
No.

01:08:59.756 --> 01:09:01.620
- You all think I'm seeing
things that don't exist.

01:09:01.758 --> 01:09:04.243
That sounds pretty crazy to me.

01:09:06.866 --> 01:09:09.835
- But you know
that it doesn't exist.

01:09:13.218 --> 01:09:14.702
Right?

01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:20.570
- I guess my mind's just...

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:22.158
Fuck.

01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:25.816
I'm such a fuckin' loser, man.

01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:27.818
Fuckin' hell.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.406
- Hey, come on.

01:09:29.544 --> 01:09:30.890
- Such a fuckin' loser.

01:09:31.028 --> 01:09:34.342
- Ian, don't start
all this again. Oh...

01:09:34.687 --> 01:09:36.758
- Fuckin' hell.
- Uh, hold on.

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:41.177
Nope.

01:09:41.315 --> 01:09:42.764
Sorry, mate.

01:09:42.902 --> 01:09:44.801
Two seconds, yeah?

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.288
[groaning]

01:10:02.301 --> 01:10:04.441
- Fuck.

01:10:40.891 --> 01:10:42.824
Nicky?

01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:52.524
Nicky?

01:11:01.015 --> 01:11:02.603
Nicky?

01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:19.723
- M, Maldives.

01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.415
- Nice.
- N, Namibia.

01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:23.831
- Yes.
- O... Oof. Wait, there is one.

01:11:23.969 --> 01:11:25.315
Hey, wait. There is one,
or there isn't one?

01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:28.007
- Yes, there is.
- Ah. Well, it-- I was--

01:11:28.145 --> 01:11:29.871
OK, what's up?

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.010
- Is that Ian?

01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:33.081
Wait. Where's Nicky?

01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:36.361
- What do we do, babe?

01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:38.742
Austin, what do we do?
- We stay calm.

01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:43.713
What's happened?
- It killed him! I told you!

01:11:43.851 --> 01:11:45.439
I told you!

01:11:45.577 --> 01:11:47.751
- Wait. Nicky?
- Is he still alive?

01:11:47.889 --> 01:11:50.685
- No, it killed him,
and it ate him!

01:11:51.514 --> 01:11:54.448
- The... big creature?
- Yes!

01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:57.934
You said it wasn't real.

01:11:58.244 --> 01:11:59.418
- OK.

01:11:59.556 --> 01:12:01.178
All right.
We're gonna keep walking.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.353
- No, you can't! You can't go
that way. That's where it is.

01:12:03.491 --> 01:12:04.768
We have to go this way.

01:12:04.906 --> 01:12:06.460
I know you think I'm crazy,
but please.

01:12:06.598 --> 01:12:09.946
- Ian, if-if we go that way,
it'll take us days

01:12:10.084 --> 01:12:11.465
to get back. OK?
- Yeah.

01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:13.294
And maybe if he's hurt,
we can-- we can save him.

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:15.503
- It killed him!

01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:18.955
Look, I know you
think I'm crazy,

01:12:19.093 --> 01:12:20.957
but we have got to
go this way. Please.

01:12:21.095 --> 01:12:22.545
I-I promise you,
we have to go this way.

01:12:22.683 --> 01:12:24.236
- Ian. Ian, doll,

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:28.447
is it OK if Austin and I just
have a quick conversation?

01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:30.656
- Oh no. God.

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:42.150
- OK. Keep behind me.
- OK. OK.

01:12:43.428 --> 01:12:45.361
Hey, Ian, doll,

01:12:45.499 --> 01:12:48.191
we're gonna keep walking in...

01:12:48.329 --> 01:12:49.606
this direction, OK?

01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:52.368
- And you're not coming with us.
All right?

01:12:52.506 --> 01:12:54.611
If you follow us,

01:12:54.749 --> 01:12:57.303
it'll be a big mistake.
Understand?

01:12:57.442 --> 01:12:58.926
- No.

01:12:59.064 --> 01:13:00.997
No, please.

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:03.758
No.

01:13:27.092 --> 01:13:28.473
- Oof!

01:13:28.611 --> 01:13:29.750
OK.

01:13:30.716 --> 01:13:32.787
All right. Let's see.

01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:44.696
Do you think we're even gonna
make it to the hut before dark?

01:13:44.834 --> 01:13:46.111
- Yeah, of course.

01:13:46.249 --> 01:13:48.182
- Are you sure?

01:13:50.391 --> 01:13:52.497
- Promise. We'll make it.

01:13:54.982 --> 01:13:56.086
[gasps]

01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:00.436
You all right?

01:14:03.093 --> 01:14:04.301
Monica!

01:14:04.716 --> 01:14:06.131
Monica!

01:14:17.418 --> 01:14:19.040
Monica!

01:14:23.976 --> 01:14:25.564
Monica?

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.988
What have you done with her?!
- Shh.

01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:38.025
It can hear you.

01:14:40.821 --> 01:14:43.271
- What have you done with her?!

01:14:59.736 --> 01:15:02.049
God. No, no, no!

01:15:02.912 --> 01:15:04.845
Oh, God.

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.330
Oh, God.

01:15:07.468 --> 01:15:09.539
No!

01:15:09.953 --> 01:15:12.646
- Look, I know you're
freaking out right now,

01:15:12.784 --> 01:15:14.406
but we've gotta get out of here.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.650
- You fuckin' monster!

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.273
- Oof!

01:15:24.623 --> 01:15:26.729
- Ah!

01:15:27.488 --> 01:15:28.696
You fucker!

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:31.285
- I thought you were
gonna kill me!

01:15:31.423 --> 01:15:34.530
- Fuck!
- I didn't kill your wife, OK?

01:15:40.984 --> 01:15:43.642
Let me help you.
Let me help you.

01:15:49.614 --> 01:15:51.719
[distant rustling]

01:15:58.519 --> 01:16:00.279

Oh, fuck.

01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:26.996
- Ah... Ah!
- Almost there.

01:16:27.548 --> 01:16:29.343
- No, we're not.

01:16:29.481 --> 01:16:32.001
What... What the fuck was that?

01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:36.419
- A bird thing, I think.
I don't know.

01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:38.490
- God. God.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.734
I'm bleeding everywhere.

01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:43.150
You should just leave me.

01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:48.742
- You're all right.
We're almost there. Promise.

01:17:28.057 --> 01:17:29.852
[silverware rattles]

01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:46.109
- It'll find us.

01:17:51.736 --> 01:17:53.427
- In the morning, I'm gonna
run the rest of the way,

01:17:53.565 --> 01:17:57.776
and I'll... get a helicopter
to come and pick you up.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.779
- Doesn't matter anyway.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.471
It's coming to get us tonight.

01:18:04.645 --> 01:18:06.751
It's hungry.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.527
Hey.

01:19:01.667 --> 01:19:03.773
I'm sorry.

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.225
For not believing you. Hm?

01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:10.538
For thinking you were crazy.

01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:19.030
- I thought I was crazy
as well, so...

01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:21.515
you're not alone.
