00:24.190 --> 00:25.859

[coughs]

00:34.659 --> 00:35.952
[coughs]

00:35.994 --> 00:37.912
- That's the point.

00:37.954 --> 00:38.955
- [camera clicks]

00:38.997 --> 00:41.624
- [choking]

00:42.625 --> 00:46.713
- One square mile,
three minutes.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.590
Everything is dead.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.967
Brimstone is fully functional.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.261
* *

00:53.303 --> 00:54.596
- Burn it.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.348

- * MacGruber *

01:33.009 --> 01:34.844
[fire crackling]

01:39.307 --> 01:41.643
- Well, someone was
in a rush this morning.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.645
You didn't even neatly
make your side of the bed

01:43.687 --> 01:45.647
while I was still sleeping
like you usually do.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.648
- Big day.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.274
I'm probably gonna
be home late.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.235
- Oh, but it's Christmas Eve.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.820
- Oh, believe me,
I would much rather

01:51.861 --> 01:54.155
spend the day tracking down
one of your famous

01:54.197 --> 01:56.491
homemade cinnamon rolls.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.826
- Listen, I'm really sorry
about everything

01:57.867 --> 01:59.369
that I've put you through
the last few days.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.662
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.539
- I'm just so happy
to have you home, honey.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.415
- Oh.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.543
I have something for you.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.255
- Oh, wow.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.298
This is great.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.551
Did you make this?

02:14.592 --> 02:17.220
- No, I don't know how to do
advanced metalwork.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.432
If I had that kind of skill,
I think you would know that.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.017
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

02:22.058 --> 02:25.854
- Besides, it's not from me.
It's actually from MacGruber.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.522
- MacGruber?
- He came by last night.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.399
Only for a little bit,
but I swear,

02:29.441 --> 02:30.442
it's not a big deal.
He was just--

02:30.483 --> 02:31.901
- I understand.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.028
Mm-hmm.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.154
- Oh.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.613
Okay.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.867
I got the feeling he was...
saying goodbye.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.160
- Mm.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.579
- Anyway, he said that was
his good luck charm,

02:42.620 --> 02:43.955
and he really wanted you
to have it.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.582
And there's actually
a story attached to it

02:45.623 --> 02:46.666
that I would like
to share with you now.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.959
- Uh-huh.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.544
- After the first night
that we made love--

02:49.586 --> 02:52.714
- Hon, I just--
I should really get going.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.424
- Okay, well, I'll tell you
the story next time.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.925
- Okay.
- Here, let me put it on you.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.011
- Okay.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.513
- Just FYI, there's something
of mine inside.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.223
- Oh.
- Just don't open it

03:02.265 --> 03:04.392
over a cup of coffee.
- Mm.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.686
- Sorry, his neck sweat

03:06.728 --> 03:08.772
probably rusted the clasp
a little bit...

03:08.813 --> 03:10.899
oh, got it.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.233
- All right, thanks.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.277
- Hey.
- Yeah?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.403
- Is everything okay?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.780
- It's just
this Queeth business.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.491
It's just taken over my mind
and...

03:19.532 --> 03:21.576
Look, I've just gotta
get through today

03:21.618 --> 03:23.536
and everything should be
different.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.829
I mean, better.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.083
- All right, well,
good luck, honey.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.669
- Thank you, Victoria.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.007
Say...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.550
after this is all over,
what do you say we fly

03:37.592 --> 03:39.344
down to Aruba, get out of here?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.595
Second honeymoon.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.431
Wipe the slate clean.
Start fresh.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.974
- Yeah, I'd really like that.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.685
- Me too.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.686
- Me too.

03:47.727 --> 03:52.440
- Love you so goddamn much.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.150
[door slams]
- Oh, honey, you left your...

03:54.192 --> 03:57.112
[foreboding music]

03:57.153 --> 03:59.114
* *

03:59.155 --> 04:00.740
- How did the test go, sir?

04:00.782 --> 04:04.035
- Well, it depends who you ask.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.122
The cows were not a fan.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.457
- Merry Christmas to all...

04:09.499 --> 04:12.127
and to all a good...

04:12.168 --> 04:13.962
fuck!

04:14.004 --> 04:15.797
Oh, don't worry, Queeth.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.718
You'll get yours soon enough,
I promise you that.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.929
For my mother, for my father,

04:22.971 --> 04:24.973
for justice and honor,

04:25.015 --> 04:26.766
for the millions of p--

04:26.808 --> 04:28.143
[engine roaring growing closer]

04:28.184 --> 04:30.311
Oh, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah!

04:30.353 --> 04:33.440
[suspenseful music]

04:33.481 --> 04:40.488
* *

04:40.530 --> 04:42.991
- I got something here.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.618
- Oh, these blankets
are so comfortable.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.328
Wait, is somebody there?
Is somebody there?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.080
Look, I mean no harm.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.499
Please, I have money.
Don't hurt me.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.585
Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me,

04:53.626 --> 04:55.712
you fucking piece of shit.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.173
Ah!

04:58.214 --> 04:59.841
Got your nose.

04:59.883 --> 05:00.759
- What the fuck?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.052
- Hey, got a joke for you.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.679
What did the hunting knife
say to your head?

05:04.721 --> 05:06.514
[grunts]

05:06.556 --> 05:07.557
Just passing through.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.518
[upbeat music]

05:10.560 --> 05:13.688
* *

05:13.730 --> 05:17.025
Now he has
an all-terrain vehicle.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.443
- Got another ping
from Southern Command.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.028
They're requesting access
to Delta files.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.196
- Approved.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.782
- Sir, you have a phone call.
It's them.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.077
- Get me a secure line, Major.
- Yes, sir.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.411
[phone ringing]

05:28.453 --> 05:31.748
[suspenseful music]

05:31.790 --> 05:33.541
- Enos Queeth, I presume?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.876
[eerily distorted]
- Oh, no, General.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.253
This is the ghost
of Christmas future.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.715
And the future is looking
very bright indeed.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.926
- Oh, yeah, why is that?

05:42.967 --> 05:47.055
- Because you are about
to pay me 50 billion dollars.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.682
- [whispers] 50 billion?

05:48.723 --> 05:49.974
- What are you planning?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.726
- Let's just say
that tomorrow morning

05:51.768 --> 05:53.895
Santa and his reindeer
are going to deliver

05:53.937 --> 05:56.564
the biggest present
the world has ever seen.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.149
And if we don't get
that money,

05:58.191 --> 05:59.818
that will just be
the beginning.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.362
- You know damn well
the United States government

06:02.404 --> 06:04.864
does not negotiate
with terrorists.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
- We'll see if you still
feel that way

06:06.616 --> 06:08.576
after tomorrow morning.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.328
- Damn it, Queeth,
you listen to me!

06:10.370 --> 06:11.705
- Bye.
[dial tone]

06:11.746 --> 06:14.958
[unsettling music]

06:15.000 --> 06:17.210
* *

06:17.252 --> 06:20.922
- Santa's starting to
get on my goddamn nerves.

06:23.008 --> 06:27.679
- Well, well, well, Queeth's
got himself quite the army.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.806
So we got two options.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.145
Option A, we pack up our shit
and throw in the towel.

06:35.186 --> 06:41.234
Option B, we go down there
and kill everything in sight.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.444
What do you say, bud?

06:42.485 --> 06:45.697
[suspenseful music]

06:45.739 --> 06:48.116
Looks like the nose have it.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.910
* *

06:50.952 --> 06:53.246
Time to go make some widows.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.171
[suspenseful music]

07:01.212 --> 07:08.136
* *

07:16.770 --> 07:20.106
- Smells like Queeth in here.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.692
All right.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.362
Time to hand out
the party favors.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.365
[device beeping]

07:28.406 --> 07:30.658
* *

07:30.700 --> 07:33.620
[eerie music]

07:33.661 --> 07:36.873
* *

07:36.915 --> 07:39.459
Things that make you go boom.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.211
[device beeping]

07:41.252 --> 07:44.172
[suspenseful music]

07:44.214 --> 07:47.467
* *

07:47.509 --> 07:51.096
Hope you weren't planning on
not exploding tonight.

07:51.137 --> 07:57.727
* *

07:57.769 --> 08:01.398
You can dish it out,
but can you take it?

08:01.439 --> 08:05.151
* *

08:17.372 --> 08:20.208
- Ready to be part of
throat rip history?

08:20.250 --> 08:24.421
* *

08:24.462 --> 08:26.840
- [chuckles]

08:26.881 --> 08:29.092
The ol' reverse throat rip,

08:29.134 --> 08:31.594
the holy grail of throat rips.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.972
And they said
it couldn't be done.

08:34.014 --> 08:39.019
But we did it, didn't we,
you dead piece of fucking shit?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.479
[door squeaks]
Ah.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.608
Looks like our little
barbecue's about to begin.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
Hope you like
your meat well-done.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.364
* *

08:51.406 --> 08:54.367
[dramatic music]

08:54.409 --> 09:00.331
* *

09:00.373 --> 09:01.791
- Tonight, it begins!
[rapid gunfire]

09:01.833 --> 09:04.252
[cheering]

09:04.294 --> 09:07.589
- Tonight, it ends.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.717
- 20 years ago,
we were exiled.

09:10.759 --> 09:14.304
Spit out, left for dead.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.805
We are the forgotten.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.475
The discarded.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.810
We're ghosts.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.021
Tomorrow,
the children of the world

09:23.063 --> 09:26.399
will receive
a very special present.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.526
Not a sweater.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.779
Not a Beanie Baby.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.989
Not a shiny new trike.

09:33.031 --> 09:37.535
No, this present is something
far more interesting.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.371
This present...

09:39.412 --> 09:40.872
it melts faces.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.334
It makes your eyes
pour out of your sockets

09:44.376 --> 09:45.835
like water.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.838
It closes throats,
it voids bowels.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.841
Kills by the millions.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.969
And it all could've been
avoided.

09:55.011 --> 10:00.392
The United States does not
negotiate with patriots.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.726
Well, fuck them.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.478
[cheering]

10:03.520 --> 10:05.188
They may have forgotten

10:05.230 --> 10:08.316
the hell that they
put us through.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.568
But tomorrow,

10:10.610 --> 10:14.739
they will remember our names.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.991
To vengeance!
[cheering]

10:17.033 --> 10:18.952
- To vengeance.

10:18.993 --> 10:23.415
* *

10:23.456 --> 10:25.458
[rapid gunfire]

10:25.500 --> 10:27.210
[cheering]

10:27.252 --> 10:28.795
- Sir,
there's a bogey approaching.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.423
[engine grows louder]
- MacGruber.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.258
[alarm blaring]

10:33.299 --> 10:36.720
[gunfire]

10:36.761 --> 10:39.180

10:39.222 --> 10:40.724
Take him out.
- Fire!

10:40.765 --> 10:45.979
[gunfire]

10:46.021 --> 10:47.981
Hold your fire!

Come and fucking get it.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.484
* *

12:14.526 --> 12:17.112
- Look likes we got
a little rodent problem.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.540
Where are you, MacGruber?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.958
We know you're in here.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.088
* *

12:35.130 --> 12:37.841
- There's no escape, MacGruber!

12:37.882 --> 12:40.176
Gonna find you.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.429
- Where the fuck are you,
MacGruber?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.098
- Dick shot!
[rapid gunfire]

12:45.140 --> 12:47.100
[both groaning]

12:47.142 --> 12:49.936
- Oh, my fucking dick!

12:49.978 --> 12:51.813
You shot me in the dick.
- [groaning]

12:51.855 --> 12:54.232
- Don't worry, guys,
I got this.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.904
I know where you're hiding now,
MacGruber.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.492
- No, you don't.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.786
- You know the best thing
about this weapon?

13:06.828 --> 13:10.373
It fires
armor-piercing bullets.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.043
- Well, Queeth, as long as
we're doing riddles,

13:13.084 --> 13:14.627
I got one for you.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.838
You know the best part
about seeing your mother

13:16.880 --> 13:18.548
get killed in front
of your eyes?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.799
- What's that?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.885
[gun cocks]
- Nothing.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.845
Drop your fucking piece.
- Okay, okay.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.221
[gun clatters]
All right, just please--

13:25.263 --> 13:27.182
please don't,
just don't--don't shoot me.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.850
Okay? Just please
just don't shoot me.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.060
I'm beg--I'm...

13:30.101 --> 13:31.895
I'm--I'm--I'm begging you.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.979
I'm begging you, please!

13:33.021 --> 13:35.690
You--you--you bested me again.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.360
- Seeing you there
on the ground, crying,

13:38.401 --> 13:40.904
pleading, begging for your life

13:40.945 --> 13:44.240
is such "Chicken Soup
for the Soul."

13:44.282 --> 13:46.117
I've been waiting
to do this to you

13:46.159 --> 13:48.912
since I was five
fucking years old.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.080
- [sobbing]

13:50.121 --> 13:53.124
- I got good news
and I got bad news, bud.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.585
The good news, not gonna
shoot you with bullets.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.713
- [winces]
- And the bad news...

13:58.755 --> 14:01.132
I'm gonna shoot you with fists.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.594
Get on your feet,
come on, let's dance!

14:04.636 --> 14:08.264
- [chuckles]

14:08.306 --> 14:10.433
- Oh, what's so funny, huh?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.811
You think about
your favorite "Dilbert" quote?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.939
Huh, you little fuckin' dumbass
"Dilbert" fan?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.024
- Oh, no, I'm--

14:18.066 --> 14:19.776
I'm--I'm laughing about this.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.277
- Mother fuck!

14:21.319 --> 14:23.863
- That's right,
I had a second gun.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.449
It's pretty funny, isn't it?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.243
By the way...

14:28.284 --> 14:29.869
I am a "Dilbert" fan.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.707
- Knew it.
You suck so hard!

14:33.748 --> 14:36.793
- Goodbye, MacGruber.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.169
[gunshot]

14:41.214 --> 14:43.466
[heroic music]

14:43.508 --> 14:45.051
* *

14:45.093 --> 14:46.553
- General.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.679
- Hello, MacGruber.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.848
- [gasps]
- Enos.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.475
- Just put the gun down.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.102
Let's just talk about this
for a minute.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.688
- I think the time
for talking is over.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.649
- Think about
what you are doing.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.443
Ah!

15:01.484 --> 15:03.945
Oh!

15:03.987 --> 15:06.614
- Oh, my God, General,
you got here just in time.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.866
Thank you so much!

15:07.907 --> 15:10.201
You saved my life!

15:10.243 --> 15:11.828
[sighs] And look...

15:11.870 --> 15:14.539
I owe you a huge apology.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.332
I am so sorry.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.834
- MacGruber--
- No, I need to say this.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.836
I need to say this!

15:19.878 --> 15:22.672
Look, I've called you
so many nasty things

15:22.714 --> 15:24.758
behind your back.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.051
I've called you a dirty diaper

15:26.092 --> 15:28.136
with arms, legs,
and half a brain.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.847
Yeah, I said that about you.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.683
I called you a fucker,
a fuckhead, fuckface.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.687
I said you're a motherfucker,
a dicknose, dickface, dickhead,

15:37.729 --> 15:39.439
shiteater, shitmouth,

15:39.481 --> 15:42.984
fuckin' tool, fuckin' asshole,
fuckin' buttwipe,

15:43.026 --> 15:45.445
shitdick, shittitty, tittydick,

15:45.487 --> 15:48.281
a little bitch, piece of fuck,
piece of shit.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.657
And I'll put 'em together
and call you

15:49.699 --> 15:51.159
a piece of fucking
titty-dick shit.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.204
You know,
I called you all that stuff.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.289
[whispering] But I was wrong.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.668
'Cause you're not
a piece of fuckin' shit.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.587
You're a piece
of fucking friend.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.548
And I mean that.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.258
- Thank you, MacGruber,
and now it's time for me

16:07.300 --> 16:08.885
to apologize to you.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.553
- For what?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.513
- For this.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.972
- What the hell are you doing?

16:13.014 --> 16:16.518
- Just finishing up the job
my dead colleague started.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.354
- Oh, you piece of fucking
titty-dick shit!

16:19.396 --> 16:21.106
So you're in on this too?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.399
- Let's just say
Queeth and I

16:22.440 --> 16:24.734
had a mutually beneficial
relationship.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.403
I helped him get you
out of jail,

16:26.444 --> 16:28.196
so he could get his hands
on Brimstone,

16:28.238 --> 16:30.281
and he gave me the one thing,

16:30.323 --> 16:33.576
the one thing in this world,
that I want most:

16:33.618 --> 16:35.537
your death.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.539
See, as long as you're alive,

16:37.580 --> 16:40.166
Victoria will never be able
to give me her whole heart.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.585
And that is why
I have to kill you.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.422
- Barrett, look,
I got a news flash for ya.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.091
Vicki married you.
She adores you!

16:48.133 --> 16:50.427
This is all
just in your imagination.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.680
- Oh, it's in my imagination
every time I caught her

16:53.722 --> 16:55.098
looking through
your wedding album?

16:55.140 --> 16:56.850
Every time
she shouted your name

16:56.891 --> 16:58.309
when we were making love?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.437
Don't you understand?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.355
- So this whole thing,

17:02.397 --> 17:05.984
all the death,
all the destruction,

17:06.026 --> 17:07.360
it's all just for Vicki?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.446
- That's right, MacGruber.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.364
I did it all for the nookie.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.616
- Vicki would be
so disappointed.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.994
- Well, it's a good thing
she's not gonna find out.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.579
'Cause now that Queeth is dead,

17:17.620 --> 17:19.414
there's only two people
in the whole world

17:19.456 --> 17:21.041
that know about this,

17:21.082 --> 17:24.294
and one of them
is about to die.

17:24.336 --> 17:27.130
[suspenseful music]

17:27.172 --> 17:28.548
[gunshot]
- [shouts]

17:30.133 --> 17:32.135
[uplifting orchestral music]

17:32.177 --> 17:34.012
- You sure about that, Barrett?

17:34.054 --> 17:35.722
* *

17:35.764 --> 17:38.350
- Victoria? What are you doing
here?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.310
- Oh, I'd ask you
the same thing

17:40.352 --> 17:42.354
but I think I've heard enough.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.147
- Please, baby, I can explain.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.066
- Don't you "baby" me, baby!

17:46.107 --> 17:47.776
- You got it all wrong, baby.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.903
- No, you know what,
I think for the first time

17:49.944 --> 17:51.571
I got it all right.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.490
When I told you MacGruber
came by last night,

17:53.531 --> 17:54.741
you didn't clench your fist

17:54.783 --> 17:57.243
or snap a pencil
like you usually do,

17:57.285 --> 17:59.162
and that struck me as strange.

17:59.204 --> 18:03.166
And then you happened to leave
a classified dossier at home.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.501
General Barrett Fasoose

18:04.542 --> 18:06.711
doesn't normally
make mistakes like that.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.838
That's when I knew
something was up.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.008
So I followed the coordinates
on your little map

18:12.050 --> 18:14.511
and I ended up here.

18:14.552 --> 18:19.349
And to think I trusted you
with my heart, and my body...

18:19.391 --> 18:21.226
and my song.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.356
* And you betrayed
my precious *

18:26.398 --> 18:31.361
* Trust *

18:31.403 --> 18:37.325
- * Let me make it up
to you, baby *

18:38.785 --> 18:39.953
All right, look,
I did it all for you

18:39.994 --> 18:41.705
and you want to
throw it away on that?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.873
- "That?"

18:43.915 --> 18:47.794
That is the most perfect man
I have ever laid eyes on.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.880
And yeah, sure,
he's impetuous, brash,

18:50.922 --> 18:54.551
hotheaded, conceited, selfish,
thoughtless, reckless,

18:54.592 --> 18:58.847
but he also has a major problem
with impulse control.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.849
But none of that matters.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.102
'Cause he is by far
the least endowed lover

19:04.144 --> 19:05.812
I have ever had.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.982
So yeah, he may be
hung like a butterfly,

19:09.024 --> 19:11.985
but he stings like a gnat.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.028
- Please, Victoria.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.531
- It's Vicki, Barrett!

19:16.573 --> 19:20.660
Vicki Gloria Saint Elmo...

19:20.702 --> 19:22.412
MacGruber.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.956
- Oh my stars, really?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.583
- If you'll have me.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.918
- Yes, yes,
a thousand times yes!

19:28.960 --> 19:32.380
- Consider yourself divorced,
you butthole.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.590

20:08.833 --> 20:09.918
- Well, my love,

20:09.959 --> 20:13.463
I think it might be time
for a little R&R.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.966
- Oh, yes, I could use
some rest and relaxation.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.301
- No.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.553
The other R&R.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.722

Oh, still got a little bit.
It's going.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.821
- What?
- Oh, just a little bit more.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.532
- Oh, I thought you were done.

fill it together.

23:07.762 --> 23:11.057
- Your love is the greatest
gift I've ever received.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.226
- And mine yours.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.644
- MacGruber.

23:14.686 --> 23:17.480
- Come here.

23:17.522 --> 23:20.650
[gulls calling]

23:20.692 --> 23:23.028
- Oh, what a beautiful day.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.989
* *

23:26.031 --> 23:29.409
- Thanks to us,
the world goes on.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.786
- Do you want me to go
rustle us up some coffees?

23:31.828 --> 23:33.163
- That can be arranged.

23:33.204 --> 23:36.041
- [chuckles]

23:36.082 --> 23:39.627
- * All the news at the door *

23:39.669 --> 23:43.173
* Such a revelry *

23:43.214 --> 23:48.178
* *

23:48.219 --> 23:51.139
- They ran out of coffee,
so I got you some apple ju--

23:51.181 --> 23:53.808
* *

23:53.850 --> 23:57.312
[dramatic music]

23:57.354 --> 23:58.897
MacGruber!

23:58.938 --> 24:00.607
Oh, God.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.692
- Hey, just gotta do
a teeny bit more cleanup

24:02.734 --> 24:04.694
then I'm ready for round two.

24:04.736 --> 24:06.154
- I think you better see this.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.282
- I'm almost tempted to say
that you better see this.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.868
- This is a major
chemical weapon attack...

24:11.910 --> 24:13.745
- Angle it over here!
- In Quito, Ecuador,

24:13.787 --> 24:15.538
home to over 2 million people

24:15.580 --> 24:18.291
and right now, as you
can see from this footage,

24:18.333 --> 24:19.626
there are crowds of people

24:19.668 --> 24:21.169
running from
what appears to be

24:21.211 --> 24:23.505
clouds of some sort
of orange gas.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.299
* *

24:26.341 --> 24:27.676
- [people screaming]

24:27.717 --> 24:29.219
* *

24:29.260 --> 24:35.100
- Oh...my...God.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.774
[suspenseful music]

24:42.816 --> 24:49.948
