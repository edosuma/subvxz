WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:07.608
AW, IT'S BROKEN.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.710
IT'S NOT BROKEN,
POINDEXTER.

00:09.743 --> 00:10.511
EH, JIMMY.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.280
YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.814
YOU'LL SEE.
ELECTRIC SLOT CARS

00:13.847 --> 00:16.450
ARE 100 TIMES MORE FUN
THAN VIDEO GAMES,

00:16.484 --> 00:20.020
AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER
IS HALF THE FUN.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.259
COULD YOU HAVE
HALF THE FUN
FOR US, GRANDPA?

00:25.293 --> 00:27.095
SURE.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.597
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.299
I STUNK.
THEY HATED ME.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.667
NO, THEY DIDN'T.
COME ON. PEOPLE
WERE CLAPPING.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.468
YEAH.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.270
THEY WERE HISSING.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.109
PROBLEM AT
THE TALENT SHOW?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.311
IT WILL HAUNT
ME FOREVER.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.578
Man: GET OUT
OF THERE!

00:44.612 --> 00:45.479
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

00:45.513 --> 00:46.847
Second man: SIT DOWN,
FINNERTY! SIT DOWN!

00:46.880 --> 00:47.915
YOU'RE RUINING
THE WHOLE SHOW.

00:47.948 --> 00:52.453
GET OUT OF HERE,
GET OUT OF HERE,
FINNERTY. GET OUT!

00:52.486 --> 00:55.489
YOU STINK,
HAVE YOU NO SHAME?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.258
I NEVER WANT
TO HEAR ANOTHER SONG

00:57.291 --> 01:00.060
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.731
MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST
GO TALK TO HER.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.534
NO, NO, NO.
BABY, WHAT SHE NEEDS
RIGHT NOW IS SPACE, OK?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.602
BELIEVE ME.
SHE'S GOING TO
LOOK BACK ON THIS

01:08.636 --> 01:10.104
AS A BETTER
THAN AVERAGE DAY.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.805
I PROMISE YOU.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.846
OK, SHE'S JUST
BEING DRAMATIC.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.451
SHE'S GOOD.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.799
I'VE NEVER SEEN LILY
THIS UPSET.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.201
COME ON. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.303
SHE'S ALWAYS
THIS UPSET.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.637
THESE ARE HER CDs,
SEAN.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.473
SHE'S NOT DOING
TOMORROW NIGHT'S SHOW.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.307
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE
THAT'S FOR THE BETTER.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.841
MAYBE WE SHOULD QUIT
WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.544
OUR DAUGHTER IS MISERABLE
AND HUMILIATED.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.613
OK, WE'RE
NOT WAY AHEAD.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.715
WHAT DID LILY DO?

01:54.748 --> 01:58.352
DID SHE TEAR UP
A PICTURE OF THE POPE
OR SOMETHING?

01:58.386 --> 01:59.052
NO.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.522
GOOD. 'CAUSE
THAT'S BEEN DONE.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.357
COME ON, MAN.
IT WASN'T EVEN
IN THAT LEAGUE,

02:03.391 --> 02:06.327
BUT I'M NOT
SAYING IT WASN'T
CONTROVERSIAL.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.698
DAD, SISTER HELEN
SAYS I CAN'T DO MY ACT.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.465
WHAT?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.301
SHE SAYS IT'S LEWD.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.703
WHAT, YOUR LITTLE
SONG AND DANCE?

02:17.271 --> 02:19.673
DAD, SHE SAYS IT'S
LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.542
LOOK--LOOK, LIL,
THESE NUNS, OK,

02:21.575 --> 02:22.676
THEY--THEY HAVE
A QUOTA OF LEWDS

02:22.710 --> 02:23.677
THEY HAVE
TO THROW OUT A DAY.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.813
LIKE, UH,
"OH, SISTER AGNES."

02:25.846 --> 02:26.914
"YES, SISTER MARGARET."

02:26.947 --> 02:29.783
"TIS WONDERFUL WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING LATELY,
ISN'T IT?"

02:29.817 --> 02:32.720
"OH, REALLY?
I FIND IT QUITE LEWD."

02:32.753 --> 02:36.724
"OH, SO DO I.
OH, LOOK AT
YONDER SUNSET.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.526
TIS BEAUTIFUL."

02:38.559 --> 02:40.361
"I FIND IT LASCIVIOUS."

02:40.394 --> 02:42.730
"OH, ME, TOO.
DOWN, SUNSET.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.965
STOP IT, SUNSET."

02:44.998 --> 02:47.501
SO ARE YOU
GOING TO HELP ME?

02:47.535 --> 02:50.804
OK, I'LL TALK
TO SISTER HELEN FOR YOU.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.774
OH.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.577
AAH, GET INSIDE!

02:57.911 --> 02:59.647
WHAT WAS SO LEWD?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.815
WHAT, WAS SHE SHAKIN'
HER MONEYMAKER?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.252
HEY, HEY, HEY.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.653
THAT'S YOUR NIECE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.956
EVERYBODY'S
GOT A MONEYMAKER.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.425
WELL, LOOK,
FROM WHAT I'D SEEN
AT THE REHEARSAL,

03:11.459 --> 03:12.593
THEY WEREN'T SHAKIN'
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.595
Lily:
* SO REFINED

03:14.628 --> 03:16.764
* SO WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE TO KNOW *

03:16.797 --> 03:19.367
* WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY MIND? *

03:19.400 --> 03:22.736
* SO LET ME GET RIGHT
TO THE POINT *

03:22.770 --> 03:26.607
* I DON'T POP MY CORK
FOR EVERY-- *

03:26.640 --> 03:28.909
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND VERY LEWD.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.544
THAT'S WHY
I WAS SO UPSET,

03:30.578 --> 03:31.912
AND I WAS ALREADY TICKED
OFF WITH SISTER HELEN

03:31.945 --> 03:34.682
BECAUSE OF THIS DAMN
CHOCOLATE DRIVE.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.685
THEY'RE GOING TO BUY
A BIGGER JESUS.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.487
YEAH, AND THE MORE BOXES
OF CHOCOLATE WE SELL,

03:39.520 --> 03:41.021
THE BETTER PRIZES
WE GET.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.857
WELL, THEN YOU GUYS
BETTER START SELLING.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.025
YOU KNOW WHO YOU
SHOULD START WITH

03:45.058 --> 03:46.327
IS MRS. DALTON
UP THE STREET.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.529
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE LIKES CANDY BARS.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.563
Claudia:
SEAN.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.665
I'M SORRY, BABY.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.533
ACTUALLY, DAD, UM,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.635
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SELL IN THE STREET.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.803
THEY SAID IT'S NOT SAFE,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.538
AND WE CAN'T
GO DOOR-TO-DOOR

03:57.571 --> 03:59.707
OR IN STORES
OR UP TO CARS.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.942
OR ANYWHERE
WHERE PEOPLE ARE.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.044
WELL, WHO ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO SELL
THEM TO?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.178
ACTUALLY, I
DON'T REALLY KNOW,

04:05.212 --> 04:08.449
BUT, UM, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE
THE MONEY IN BY MONDAY.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.850
OH, YOU KNOW,
I GET IT.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.651
THEY EXPECT US
TO BUY IT.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.720
THAT'S--YOU KNOW,
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.422
ALL RIGHT,
HOW MUCH ARE THEY?

04:14.455 --> 04:15.656
NO, NO, BABY, UH-UH.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.825
LISTEN, WE PAY
THE TUITION, OK,

04:17.858 --> 04:19.259
AND WE SUBJECT OUR CAR
TO THEIR SO-CALLED
CAR WASHES,

04:19.293 --> 04:22.330
AND WE BUY THE UNIFORMS
FROM THE ONE APPROVED
STORE, McCAFFREY'S.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.432
TELL ME THERE'S
NO KICKBACK THERE.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.198
ALL RIGHT,
AND NOW THEY WANT MORE

04:25.232 --> 04:26.634
SO THEY FORCE
THE CHOCOLATE ON US.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.336
YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS REALLY?
IT IS...

04:28.369 --> 04:31.605
Both: OUR LADY OF
PERPETUAL SHAKEDOWN.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.006
WELL, IT IS.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.810
YOU KNOW, YOU GET
TOO WORKED UP ABOUT STUFF.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.546
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A STROKE.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.749
TOLD YOU.
YOU GOTTA LET IT GO.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.651
LOOK--LOOK, THIS--
THIS SISTER HELEN

04:43.684 --> 04:45.753
IS A CHOCOLATE PUSHER,
ALL RIGHT,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.921
AND THEN SHE HAS THE GALL
TO BAN LILY'S ACT

04:47.955 --> 04:50.057
FOR A COMPLETELY
BOGUS REASON.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.560
MR. FINNERTY,
BIG SPENDER

04:52.593 --> 04:54.828
IS A SONG
ABOUT PROSTITUTES.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.629
THEY'RE NOT PROSTITUTES.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.365
THEY'RE--THEY'RE
DIME-A-DANCE GIRLS.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.100
PLEASE. THEY'RE
SELLING MORE
THAN DANCES.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.802
OH, COME ON,
FOR A DIME?

05:01.835 --> 05:04.505
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THE LYRICS, HUH?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.774
"I CAN SHOW YOU
A GOOD TIME.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.477
"FUN, LAUGHS,
GOOD TIMES.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.712
FUN, LAUGHS,
GOOD TIMES."

05:11.745 --> 05:12.880
COME ON, SISTER HELEN.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.582
HAS YOUR HEART
GROWN SO COLD

05:14.615 --> 05:15.516
THAT THERE
IS NO ROOM LEFT

05:15.549 --> 05:17.551
FOR FUN, LAUGHS,
OR GOOD TIMES?

05:17.585 --> 05:19.653
THE SONG HAS A SUBTEXT,
MR. FINNERTY.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.755
IT'S A SIMPLE
LITTLE SONG.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.856
ABOUT PROSTITUTES.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.825
IT'S A CLASSIC
OF THE BROADWAY STAGE.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.727
IT'S NO
SOUND OF MUSIC.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.062
OH, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
GOING TO PICK THAT ONE.

05:29.096 --> 05:29.930
YOU'RE A NUN.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.501
OK, THEN, IT'S
NO WEST SIDE STORY.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.469
OK, THAT'S
A GOOD ONE, BUT, LOOK,

05:35.503 --> 05:37.070
THE POINT IS THIS,
SISTER HELEN:

05:37.104 --> 05:37.938
I'M LILY'S FATHER,

05:37.971 --> 05:39.773
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO LET ANYTHING HAPPEN

05:39.807 --> 05:41.108
THAT'S GOING TO HURT
HER REPUTATION.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.644
COME ON, THIS WHOLE THING
IS JUST SO INNOCENT,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.613
AND--AND IT MEANS
SO MUCH TO HER.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.949
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D STAND IN HER WAY.

05:54.422 --> 05:57.791
DO YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE,
MR. FINNERTY?

05:57.825 --> 06:01.094
I LOVE CHOCOLATE...

06:02.596 --> 06:04.031
A LOT.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.947
WOW, YOU GOT
OUTSMARTED BY A NUN.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.515
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.916
I MADE A DEAL WITH
THE NUN, ALL RIGHT?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.518
I GOT WHAT I WANTED.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.786
AND THAT'S WHY
LILY'S UPSTAIRS,

06:25.819 --> 06:29.156
AND HER CD COLLECTION
IS DOWNSTAIRS.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.492
IT WAS
AWFUL, GRANDPA.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.527
THEY WERE
BOOING ME.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.162
AW, LILY.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.666
YOU KNOW,
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM.

06:38.699 --> 06:43.203
YOU REMEMBER THAT
OLD BASEBALL PLAYER
BOOG POWELL?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.105
NO.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.940
EVERY TIME HE
CAME TO THE PLATE

06:46.974 --> 06:49.142
IT SOUNDED LIKE
THEY WERE BOOING HIM...

06:49.176 --> 06:54.582
BUT REALLY THEY WERE
SHOUTING "BOOG, BOOG."

06:54.615 --> 06:58.619
BUT, GRANDPA,
MY NAME ISN'T BOOG

06:58.652 --> 07:00.988
OR ANYTHING THAT
SOUNDS LIKE BOOG.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.824
YEAH, I KNOW...

07:03.857 --> 07:06.927
BUT PERFORMING
IS VERY HARD, LILY.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.029
EVERY TIME
THE CURTAIN GOES UP,

07:09.062 --> 07:14.067
YOU PUT YOURSELF
OUT THERE ON THE LINE.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.636
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.037
DO YOU KNOW
THE PLAYERS' NAMES?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.939
YES.
SO WHO'S ON FIRST?

07:18.972 --> 07:22.643
UH, I KNOW THIS.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.478
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.713
Who.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.047
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.015
Who's on first.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.517
I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.083
WHO!

07:30.117 --> 07:31.752
THIS IS VERY CONFUSING.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.753
WHO'S ON FIRST.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.821
LEAVE ME ALONE.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.688
Man: YOU STINK.

07:34.722 --> 07:38.258
YEAH, I'M GONNA
BREAK YOUR NECK, MARVIN.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.530
THAT ROUTINE
WAS WRITTEN WRONG.

07:42.863 --> 07:47.067
I NEVER WANT TO PERFORM
ANYTHING ANYWHERE
EVER AGAIN.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.772
GOOD. IT'LL BRING YOU
NOTHING BUT HEARTACHE.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.975
I WANT TO BE
THE YELLOW CAR.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.009
FINE.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.712
NO, ACTUALLY,
I THINK I WANT
TO BE THE BLUE CAR.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.479
FINE.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.882
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THE RED CAR.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.584
SURE.
NO!

08:03.617 --> 08:05.986
I WANT TO BE
THE RED CAR.

08:06.019 --> 08:06.687
FINE.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.221
SO, GUYS, YOU
HAVING FUN YET?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.658
I CAN'T GET
THIS TOGETHER.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.926
AND JIMMY WON'T LET ME
BE THE CAR I WANT TO BE.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.828
WHA--
JIMMY.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.699
WHY DON'T YOU HOOK ME UP
WITH SOME CHOCOLATE, HUH?

08:18.732 --> 08:19.967
SURE. IT'S
2 BUCKS A BAR.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.003
YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST WAIT
TILL YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
AND TAKE ONE.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.938
OH, COME ON, I HAVE
TO SELL THEM, MAN.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.940
I--I--I SPENT
400 BUCKS
ON THIS CHOCOLATE.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.310
WHAT DO YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT SELLING CHOCOLATE?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.646
WE KNOW HOW
NOT TO SELL IT.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.081
BEFORE YOUR WAITRESS
COMES OVER,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.616
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT

08:35.649 --> 08:36.984
OUR VERY SPECIAL
DESSERTS TONIGHT.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.752
WE HAVE A TRIO
OF CHOCOLATE BARS:

08:38.786 --> 08:41.722
MILK, DARK, AND ALMOND.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.928
UH, EXCUSE ME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

08:47.961 --> 08:49.697
CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

08:49.730 --> 08:50.430
UH, EXCUSE ME.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.199
I'M NOT HERE
TO HURT OR ROB YOU.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.768
CIRCUMSTANCES
BEYOND MY CONTROL

08:54.802 --> 08:55.569
HAVE FORCED ME
TO BE HERE

08:55.603 --> 08:58.005
UH, ON THE STREET
AND IN THE SUBWAY,

08:58.038 --> 09:01.642
TRYING TO RAISE MONEY
FOR A GOOD CAUSE, UH...

09:01.675 --> 09:02.876
WHO WOULD LIKE
A CANDY BAR?

09:02.910 --> 09:03.644
MA'AM, WOULD YOU LIKE--

09:03.677 --> 09:04.745
MA'AM, WOULD YOU LIKE
A CANDY BAR?

09:04.778 --> 09:07.715
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY A CANDY BAR?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.017
DO NOT MOVE AWAY FROM ME.
I'M HUMAN JUST LIKE YOU.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.587
I DO NOT NEED A HANDOUT.
I NEED A HAND UP.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.655
PLEASE, SIR.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.990
SIR, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO BUY A CANDY BAR?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.959
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.694
Y'ALL JUST DON'T
KNOW HOW TO MOVE PRODUCT.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.096
AW, YEAH, YEAH,
LIKE YOU COULD HAVE
SOLD THE CHOCOLATE.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.197
I COULD HAVE SOLD
THAT CHOCOLATE.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.198
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE CHOCOLATE.

09:25.232 --> 09:30.003
IT'S ABOUT SELLING
THE IDEA OF THE CHOCOLATE.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.840
IT'S ABOUT
THE CHOCOLATE LIFESTYLE.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.776
OK, FINE, BE MY GUEST,
SELL THE CHOCOLATE.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.845
NO, I'M TOO TIRED.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.013
OH, YES.

09:40.047 --> 09:40.981
WHAT?

09:41.014 --> 09:43.050
SHE SMASHED
THE SOUNDTRACK
TO GREASE.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.686
OH, YES!
THANK YOU, GOD!

09:45.719 --> 09:47.721
WHOO!

09:47.755 --> 09:49.089
OHH.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.057
LILY REALLY FREAKED OUT.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.826
I MEAN, DID SHE
SUCK THAT BAD?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.061
NO, SEE THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

09:54.094 --> 09:54.928
THEY DIDN'T
SUCK AT ALL.

09:54.962 --> 09:58.732
* THE MINUTE
YOU WALKED IN THE JOINT *

09:58.766 --> 10:03.070
* I COULD SEE YOU WERE
A MAN OF DISTINCTION *

10:03.103 --> 10:06.073
* A REAL BIG SPENDER

10:06.106 --> 10:09.910
* GOOD LOOKING,
SO REFINED *

10:09.943 --> 10:11.812
* WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE TO KNOW *

10:11.845 --> 10:13.113
* WHAT'S GOING ON...

10:13.146 --> 10:14.014
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

10:14.047 --> 10:18.051
BUT I WANT
TO GIVE THAT ONE
MY ALLOWANCE.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.687
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.156
STOP THIS! STOP!
WH-WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.257
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.395
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
SAT IN THIS CHAIR,
GOD REST HER SOUL.

10:30.097 --> 10:30.931
OH.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.133
AAH!
OH!

10:41.408 --> 10:43.711
HEY, LIL.

10:43.744 --> 10:48.115
WHY THE BIG FROWN?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.086
Jimmy: OW, OW!
HEY, WHAT THE--

10:53.120 --> 10:54.755
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:54.788 --> 10:58.425
STOP SENDING YOUR LACKEYS
TO CHEER ME UP.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.029
YOUR PITY DISGUSTS ME.

11:02.062 --> 11:06.466
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME NOW
TO PULL OUT THE BIG GUNS.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.435
WAIT, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO CHEER HER UP?

11:08.468 --> 11:11.038
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A SECTION OF ORANGE PEEL

11:11.071 --> 11:12.940
AND PUT IT IN MY TEETH

11:12.973 --> 11:16.109
AND ACT LIKE A MONSTER.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.147
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.449
IT MAKES ALL
MY FRIENDS LAUGH.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.118
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE ALL BAKED.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.955
THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THEY'RE NOT
A DISCERNING AUDIENCE.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.990
SIT DOWN.
THAT'S IT.
I'VE HAD IT.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.259
I CAN'T STAND THIS
ANYMORE. I GOTTA
GO TELL HER.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.126
OH, NO, NO, NO,
YOU DON'T.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.194
YES, I DO. IT'S
THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.730
OH, SO NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO IS.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.032
IF YOU WOULD HAVE
JUST LISTENED TO ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.034
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.436
SEAN, YOU'RE
OVERREACTING.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.404
TRUST ME. I AM NOT.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.106
ALL RIGHT,
THEY HAD THIS
WHOLE THING SET UP.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.341
THEY HAD THESE--THESE
CHAIRS AND THE LEGS.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.378
THEY WERE LIKE, "WHOO,
AHH, UHH."

11:51.411 --> 11:52.780
WELL, IT WAS DIFFERENT
WHEN THEY DID IT.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.580
GORDON, KEEP MOVING.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.482
COME ON. THIS IS
JUST TEENAGE STUFF.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.984
IT'S NORMAL. IT'S FUN.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.853
REMEMBER HOW I WAS
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.797
OH, YEAH.
I REMEMBER,

12:09.830 --> 12:12.299
AND IT'S NOT HELPING
YOUR ARGUMENT ANY.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.505
I GOTTA NAIL THAT.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.173
GROSS.
LOOK, ALL
I'M SAYING IS,

12:20.207 --> 12:23.076
DO YOU WANT TO BE
A GRANDMOTHER BY
THE TIME YOU'RE 32?

12:23.110 --> 12:23.777
OH, COME ON, BE REAL.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.045
LOOK, YOU WEREN'T
EVEN THERE.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.479
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THE WAY SHE LOOKED.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.815
IT WAS LIKE--

12:27.848 --> 12:30.317
FUN...

12:30.350 --> 12:32.019
SO SHE WAS
WORKING IT A LITTLE.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.954
OH, NO, NO,
NOT A LITTLE.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.055
WE'RE TALKING--

12:35.088 --> 12:38.558
LAUGHS...

12:38.591 --> 12:39.927
SEAN, PLEASE.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.330
THIS IS A LILY I HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

12:43.363 --> 12:47.334
GOOD TIMES.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.536
OK, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.570
NO, NO, IT'S SCARY.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.538
YEAH, BUT WANTING
TO LOOK SEXY

12:51.571 --> 12:54.207
IS NOT THE SAME THING
AS WANTING TO HAVE SEX.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.342
LILY, COME HERE.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.277
YOU FATHER HAS
A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR DANCE ROUTINE.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.379
YEAH, I KNOW.
HE CONFISCATED MY CHAIR.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.914
OK, LOOK,
I'VE GOT NOTHING
AGAINST DANCING.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.415
ALL RIGHT, BUT
THERE'S A KIND YOU
DO WITH A PARTNER,

13:02.449 --> 13:05.518
AND THERE'S
A KIND YOU DO
OUT BY THE AIRPORT.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.987
DAD, IT WAS JUST AN ACT.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.188
YEAH, REMEMBER
WHEN WE WENT TO SEE

13:08.221 --> 13:09.890
HENRY'S CLASS
DO WINNIE THE POOH?

13:09.923 --> 13:13.126
YOU KNEW HENRY
WASN'T A REAL PIGLET.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.262
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
ARE GOING TO BE GREAT.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.263
I SAY HAVE FUN.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.264
THANK YOU, MOM.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.598
YOU ARE WELCOME.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.835
YOU SEE, I WAS
TRYING TO NIP IT
IN THE BUD, BUT NO.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.036
OH, OK, SHUT UP.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.537
YOU SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED

13:24.571 --> 13:26.173
TO THAT GOOD NUN
IN THE FIRST
PLACE.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.574
YOU WOULD HAVE
AVOIDED THIS
WHOLE THING.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.608
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I REALIZE THAT,

13:28.641 --> 13:29.977
BUT BY THE TIME
I SAW THE LIGHT,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

13:30.010 --> 13:35.348
SISTER HELEN,
BIG SPENDER IS A SONG
ABOUT PROSTITUTES.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.851
I KNOW THAT,
MR. FINNERTY.

13:37.885 --> 13:38.551
IT'S LEWD.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.887
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.889
IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.991
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
PULL IT FROM THE SHOW.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.159
DO WHAT YOU WANTED
TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.094
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.262
OH, I'M AFRAID IT'S
TOO LATE, MR. FINNERTY.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.630
THE PROGRAMS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN PRINTED.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.034
THE PROGRAMS? WHO GIVES
A RAT'S AS-K ANYBODY...

13:54.067 --> 13:55.068
NO ONE READS THE PROGRAMS.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.369
I THINK WE'RE FINISHED.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.570
OH, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.639
I THINK THAT
WE CAN MAYBE, UH,

13:59.672 --> 14:03.143
MAKE SOME KIND
OF ARRANGEMENT HERE.

14:03.176 --> 14:03.710
HMM?

14:03.743 --> 14:04.978
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

14:05.012 --> 14:06.279
WELL, TO SHOW
MY APPRECIATION

14:06.313 --> 14:10.083
FOR YOUR TAKING
A MOMENT TO HEAR
MY CONCERNS...

14:10.117 --> 14:14.587
PERHAPS I SHOULD
BUY SOME MORE OF
THAT TASTY CHOCOLATE, HUH?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.990
WELL, THAT
WOULD BE VERY NICE.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.626
HOW MANY BOXES
SHOULD I GET?
SHALL WE SAY...

14:19.659 --> 14:22.329
UM, 20?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.231
FINE.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.433
UH, LET'S MAKE IT 30.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.435
IT'S FOR
A GOOD CAUSE, RIGHT?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.636
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

14:29.669 --> 14:33.606
IF YOU WOULD JUST
INITIAL THIS PROMISSORY
NOTATION THERE.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.209
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.010
OH, UH...

14:37.044 --> 14:39.312
I ASSUME THAT YOU'LL
BE TELLING LILY.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.413
EXCUSE ME?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.382
THAT HER MUSICAL
NUMBER'S BEEN CUT.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.616
OH, I'M SORRY,
MR. FINNERTY,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.418
BUT THE PROGRAMS
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRINTED.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.088
I THINK I WAS
QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.056
WHAT?

14:49.089 --> 14:49.822
UH, SISTER CAMILLE.

14:49.856 --> 14:50.991
WOULD YOU PLEASE
HELP MR. FINNERTY

14:51.024 --> 14:53.026
WITH A CART
FOR HIS CHOCOLATE?

14:53.060 --> 14:53.793
THANK YOU.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.329
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
HOW'RE WE DOING?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.967
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.319
YOU TRIED
TO BRIBE A NUN!

15:19.352 --> 15:21.221
YES, YES!

15:21.254 --> 15:22.655
EVERYONE HAS THEIR PRICE.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.557
NOT A NUN.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.327
FINE, DAD.
KEEP LIVING IN YOUR
LITTLE FANTASY WORLD.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
NUNS AREN'T IN IT
FOR THE MONEY.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.231
THEY AREN'T.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.265
OK.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.501
STOP IT.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.171
COME ON, GUYS.
YOU'RE NOT
PLAYING IT RIGHT.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.606
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
A LITTLE MORE JUICE.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.740
OH, YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS

15:40.773 --> 15:43.110
WHEN WE GIVE IT
A LITTLE JUICE?
YEAH.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.645
WHOA, WHOA!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.518
MMMMMM!

15:59.326 --> 16:01.995
ARE YOU TRYING
TO CHEER ME UP?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.297
MAYBE.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.298
DON'T.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.533
SO YOU HAD
A LITTLE DOSE

16:06.566 --> 16:09.702
OF PUBLIC
HUMILIATION, HUH?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.204
BIG TIME.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.340
I BEEN THERE.

16:13.373 --> 16:17.010
SOMETIMES YOU'RE
JUST GONNA SUCK.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.079
THAT'S OK?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.148
NO, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.350
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE ADVISE?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.718
NO, I'M JUST RAMBLING.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.454
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
ONE PIECE OF ADVISE.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.624
AIM LOW, THAT WAY
YOU DON'T END UP
SO DISAPPOINTED.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.162
BUT I THOUGHT I COULD BE
ANYTHING I DREAMED?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.031
NO, THAT'S CRAP.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.067
IF PEOPLE COULD BE
ANYTHING THEY DREAMED

16:40.100 --> 16:42.035
THE WORLD WOULD BE
FULL OF MOVIE STARS

16:42.069 --> 16:42.969
AND--AND ASTRONAUTS,

16:43.002 --> 16:47.807
AND THEN--THEN WHO WOULD
MAKE THE SANDWICHES?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.310
THAT MAKES SENSE.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.414
HEY, LIL, YOU OK?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.716
YEAH, YEAH.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.418
I'M TAKING
EDDIE'S ADVISE.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.653
I'M GONNA
AIM LOWER.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.690
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.492
I THOUGHT
I WAS TALENTED,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.760
AND IT TURNS OUT
I'M NOT.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.596
SO I QUIT.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.330
IT'S OK.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.765
THE WORLD NEEDS
SANDWICH MAKERS.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.767
THAT'S RIGHT.
STAY UNDER THE RADAR.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.836
HONEY,
YOU HAVE TALENT.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.770
REALLY. YOU HAVE
A LOT OF TALENT.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.207
MOM, PLEASE.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO THE GIRL?

17:20.240 --> 17:20.973
I'M TELLING
HER THE TRUTH.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.475
OH, BAD MOVE,
BAD MOVE, BAD MOVE.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.111
SEAN, PLEASE.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.812
YOU SEE YOU
COULDN'T REALLY

17:25.845 --> 17:27.380
SEE THE WHOLE
STORY...

17:27.414 --> 17:28.581
ON STAGE.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.125
OOH, HERE
COMES LILY.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.292
BOY, CAN'T WAIT.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.361
OH, COME ON, SEAN.
SIT BACK AND SMILE.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.028
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.598
YOU'RE MY BRAVE
LITTLE MAN.

18:02.382 --> 18:06.453
* THE MINUTE YOU
WALKED IN THE JOINT *

18:06.486 --> 18:10.857
* I COULD SEE YOU WERE
A MAN OF DISTINCTION *

18:10.890 --> 18:14.127
* A REAL BIG SPENDER

18:14.161 --> 18:15.628
* GOOD LOOKING

18:15.662 --> 18:17.497
* SO REFINED

18:17.530 --> 18:19.199
* SO WOULDN'T
YOU LIKE TO KNOW *

18:19.232 --> 18:21.801
* WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY MIND? *

18:21.834 --> 18:25.672

18:46.893 --> 18:49.229
I KNOW HER.
SHE'S A 10th GRADER.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.897
NO WAY.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.237
THIS IS HOT!

18:57.270 --> 18:58.405
Boy: SHAKE IT!

* FUN

19:03.276 --> 19:04.911

19:08.348 --> 19:09.682
* GOOD TIME

19:09.716 --> 19:12.519
* I CAN SHOW YOU A

19:12.985 --> 19:16.689

19:23.463 --> 19:27.634

19:34.907 --> 19:36.209
* SO WOULDN'T
YOU LIKE TO KNOW *

19:36.243 --> 19:39.279
* WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY MIND?... *

19:39.312 --> 19:41.814
I THINK I'M POPPING
MY CORK RIGHT NOW.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.782
DO SOMETHING.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.584
I AM. I'M WATCHING
THE SHOW LIKE YOU
TOLD ME.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.354
I'D LIKE TO SPEND
A LITTLE TIME WITH HER.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.988
SHE IS 15 YEARS OLD.

19:49.021 --> 19:49.922
SO AM I.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.291
* HEY, BIG SPENDER

19:51.324 --> 19:54.227
* HEY, BIG SPENDER...

19:54.261 --> 19:57.730
I WANT THESE BOYS
KICKED OUT OF HERE.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.300
JUST HOLD ON. I
HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL,
SISTER.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.501
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.535
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER!

20:02.569 --> 20:04.237
WOULD YOU SHUT UP!

20:04.737 --> 20:05.972
SIT DOWN!

20:06.005 --> 20:07.006
YOU SHUT UP!

20:07.039 --> 20:07.974
GET THE HECK
OUT OF HERE!

20:08.007 --> 20:09.642
YOU WANT
A PIECE OF SEAN?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.311
YOU'RE RUINING
THE WHOLE SHOW,
FINNERTY.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.545
YOU'RE RUINING
THE WHOLE SHOW.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.613
GET OUT OF HERE.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.250
YOU STINK!
HAVE YOU NO SHAME?

20:17.284 --> 20:18.851
SO YOU SEE.
IT WASN'T YOU.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.886
YOU DIDN'T SUCK.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.589
YEAH? YOU DID.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.258
HOW COULD
YOU DO THAT?

20:25.292 --> 20:27.660
I'M SORRY.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.928
I JUST HAVE ALWAYS
THOUGHT WE HAD

20:28.961 --> 20:31.564
THIS REALLY GOOD OPEN
RELATIONSHIP.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.533
YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER,

20:33.566 --> 20:36.836
AND TONIGHT,
I JUST LOST IT.

20:36.869 --> 20:37.804
I MEAN, I JUST--

20:37.837 --> 20:38.971
I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO THINK
I WAS ONE OF THOSE

20:39.005 --> 20:42.309
TYPICAL, UPTIGHT,
PRUDISH MOMS.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.710
WHICH YOU ARE.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.544
I KNOW.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.046
YOU WERE REALLY
GREAT TONIGHT, HONEY.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.781
OHH!

20:54.321 --> 20:59.258
HOW OLD WERE THOSE BOYS
THAT WERE HOOTING FOR ME?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.828
I DON'T KNOW.
10th GRADERS,
MAYBE 11th.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.997
AND THEY WERE SAYING
STUFF LIKE, "OOH, BABY,"

21:05.031 --> 21:06.866
STUFF LIKE THAT?

21:06.899 --> 21:09.536
YEAH, IT
WAS DISTURBING.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.570
THAT IS SO COOL!

21:10.603 --> 21:12.905
I CAN'T WAIT
TO DO IT AGAIN.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.006
OH, GREAT NEWS.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.575
YOU'RE COMING,
RIGHT, GRANDPA?

21:15.608 --> 21:16.275
ONLY IF YOU WANT

21:16.309 --> 21:19.379
AN AUDIENCE
FULL OF DEAD BOYS.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.083
SO--SO HOW DOES
IT FEEL, BABY?

21:24.116 --> 21:27.086
WHAT?
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE ME?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.588
OH...

21:30.857 --> 21:34.293
YOU MEAN A BIG
FLAMING ASS?

21:34.761 --> 21:35.762
IT'S HORRIBLE.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.030
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO THIS
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.000
OH, IT'S JUST A GIFT.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.935
HEY, HEY,
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GET THAT?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.538
WELL, THEY'RE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.408
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THEY'RE 2 BUCKS A POP.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.110
I ALREADY PAID EDDIE
A BUCK FOR THIS.

21:51.143 --> 21:57.584
WHAT?! EDDIE!

21:57.617 --> 21:58.351
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE JOKE.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.019
THE FAT GUY DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND IT

22:00.052 --> 22:03.823
WHEN THE SKINNY
GUY TELLS HIM
THE PLAYERS' NAMES.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.624
THAT DOESN'T SOUND FUNNY.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.727
IT IS, BECAUSE WHO
PLAYS FIRST,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.496
WHAT'S ON SECOND,

22:09.529 --> 22:11.698
AND I DON'T KNOW
IS ON THIRD.

22:11.731 --> 22:12.565
NEITHER DO I.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.734
THAT'S WHY I KEEP
FORGETTING THE LINES.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.538
NO, HIS NAME IS
"I DON'T KNOW."

22:18.571 --> 22:19.872
WELL, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

22:19.906 --> 22:20.907
THAT'S MORONIC.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.610
IT'S FUNNY
BECAUSE THE FAT GUY
LOSES HIS TEMPER.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.845
WELL, WHAT'S FUNNY
ABOUT THAT?
