WEBVTT

00:11.444 --> 00:12.979
- WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE,

00:13.013 --> 00:17.550
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE
TO WORK THAN NEW YORK CITY.

00:17.584 --> 00:21.721
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
THIS CITY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.224
NO, THAT'S WHERE WE STAND.

00:24.257 --> 00:25.825
I'M NOT GONNA BUDGE.
I DON'T NEGOTIATE.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.160
EITHER SEND A CONTRACT OUT,

00:27.193 --> 00:28.628
OR WE'RE GONNA BUY
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.330
NEVER PICK UP THE PHONE
FOR THAT BROKER AGAIN.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.165
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.700
THIS YEAR I'M NOT
TAKING [bleep] FROM ANYONE.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.403
YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE SMARTER
THAN YOU ACTUALLY ARE.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.139
LAST YEAR I LEFT MYSELF OPEN,
AND I WAS TOO TRUSTING,

00:39.172 --> 00:41.675
AND I LEARNED FROM IT
BY BEING [bleep] OVER.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.477
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE?
- NO.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.646
SUPPLY AND DEMAND,
ISN'T IT?

00:46.680 --> 00:49.115
- I NOW REALIZE,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:49.149 --> 00:50.617
YOU HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

00:50.650 --> 00:51.818
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.053
[bleep] EVERYONE.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.988
YURI, WE HAVE TO START,
LIKE, MOWING PEOPLE DOWN.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.322
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
THE ESCALADE.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.092
MY SALES ARE BIGGER
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN,

00:59.125 --> 01:03.563
SO, FROM NOW ON,
I AM ONLY ABOUT ME.

01:03.596 --> 01:07.534
BUT I'VE LEFT A LITTLE ROOM
FOR MY GIRLFRIEND.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.537
DO YOU LIKE THIS?
THIS TIE WORK?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.205
OR IS IT A LITTLE SHINY?
- NO, I LIKE IT.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.873
IT'S GOOD.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.475
I HAVE A REAL,
LIVE GIRLFRIEND.

01:15.508 --> 01:18.111
YOU ALMOST READY?
- I'M WAITING ON YOU, PRINCESS.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.480
- I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR A GIRLFRIEND AT ALL,

01:20.513 --> 01:24.517
AND IT'S GREAT, AS LONG
AS SHE OPERATES ON MY TERMS.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
- [humming]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.759
[exhales deeply]

01:32.792 --> 01:34.094
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:34.094 --> 01:38.531
- I'M FINDING
MY NON-EMAIL WORKING BALANCE.

01:38.565 --> 01:42.168
I HAVE TO ADMIT--BEING MARRIED
IS REALLY CHANGING ME.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.170
- I THINK I LIKE
WHEN YOU ANSWER EMAILS BETTER.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.672
- SHH. SLEEP.

01:45.705 --> 01:48.341
I AM GETTING BETTER
WITH PUTTING MY PHONE DOWN

01:48.375 --> 01:49.743
AND SPENDING TIME
WITH THE PEOPLE

01:49.776 --> 01:53.013
THAT MATTERS TO ME, DEREK.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.148
THERE WAS A LOT OF UPS
AND DOWNS LAST YEAR,

01:55.181 --> 01:57.617
AND I SAW SOME UGLINESS
IN MYSELF.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.252
- DON'T BE A STUPID
[bleep] CHILD.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.620
GIVE ME THAT GODDAMN CHECK.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.456
- AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M TRYING TO WORK ON,

02:03.490 --> 02:05.859
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'VE LOST ANY OF MY EDGE.

02:05.892 --> 02:09.629
I'M STILL FIERCE
WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.197
[cell phone rings]

02:11.231 --> 02:12.832
FREDRIK SPEAKING.
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.501
FREDRIK SPEAKING.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:14.534 --> 02:17.437
EVERY DEVELOPER IN TOWN,
ACTUALLY, THE NATION...

02:17.470 --> 02:18.605
NEBRASKA?

02:18.638 --> 02:20.306
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE NEBRASKA IS.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.374
WANTS TO WORK WITH ME.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.243
BEING A TOP BROKER
IN NEW YORK CITY,

02:23.276 --> 02:24.944
IT'S A TOUGH WORLD
OUT THERE.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.546
JUST TRUST ME.
YOU CALLED ME FOR A REASON.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.714
LET ME DO MY JOB.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.150
BUT YET, OUT THERE,
NEGOTIATING, FIGHTING.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.685
A LOT OF BROKERS
WOULD NOT DARE

02:31.718 --> 02:33.253
TO EVEN TELL YOU
THIS INFORMATION.

02:33.286 --> 02:37.524
I DON'T WANT TO FORGET
WHO'S UNDERNEATH THE SUIT,

02:37.557 --> 02:38.692
NOT THIS YEAR.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.466
- RECENTLY I HAVE DONE
A LOT OF REFLECTING,

02:46.499 --> 02:47.801
AND I HAVE LEARNED
A LOT OF THINGS.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.636
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS
THAT I'VE LEARNED

02:49.669 --> 02:51.104
WAS THAT
I HAD TOO MUCH ENERGY.

02:51.104 --> 02:54.441
PLEASE, EVERYBODY,
LET'S HAVE A DRINK, GOD DAMN IT.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.209
OH, I LOVE IT.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.377
COME HERE,
DANCE SOME SALSA.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.645
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.646
ALL RIGHT.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.847
[plate clatters]

03:00.880 --> 03:02.849
JESUS.
I'M SORRY. I'M VERY EXCITED.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.819
SO, FOR ME
TO BE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL

03:05.852 --> 03:07.354
AND RESPECTED,

03:07.387 --> 03:09.823
I NEED TO FOCUS
THAT ENERGY.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.358
- BETTER, BETTER.
ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.359
GO.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.493
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.397
- AND THAT WILL MAKE ME
THE BEST BROKER IN TOWN.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.233
IN MY LIFE, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE THE BEST,

03:20.266 --> 03:23.069
AND THAT'S WHY I NEED TO BE
SURROUNDED BY THE BEST.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.204
SO I'M CHANGING EVERYTHING,

03:24.237 --> 03:25.672
AND ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT CHANGES

03:25.705 --> 03:27.874
HAVE BEEN THE FACT
THAT I CHANGED COMPANIES.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.209
I MOVED TO DOUGLAS ELLIMAN,

03:29.242 --> 03:30.877
AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST BROKERS
IN THE CITY

03:30.910 --> 03:33.813
WORK AT THIS FIRM,
INCLUDING FREDRIK EKLUND.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.081
- HI.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.951
- THIS YEAR
I'M CHANGING MY MIND-SET

03:37.984 --> 03:39.853
TOWARDS THE THINGS
THAT I DO

03:39.886 --> 03:41.287
AND WORKING NOT JUST HARD
BUT SMART.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.455
I WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.257
[bleep], I FEEL LIKE
I'M MATURING.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.527
[chuckles]
IT'S GOOD.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.529
- I'VE ALREADY MADE
A LOT OF MONEY.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.765
WHAT I WANT NOW
IS MORE POWER.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.901
POWER IS CONTROL
OVER PEOPLE.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.204
- POWER USED
TO MEAN MONEY,

03:58.238 --> 04:02.642
BUT POWER IS THE ABILITY
TO DO GOOD.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.644
- THE KIND OF POWER THAT
I WANT TO ACHIEVE IS THE ONE

04:04.678 --> 04:06.046
THAT'S EARNED
THROUGH RESPECT.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.381
I WANT TO BE RESPECTED,
NOT FEARED.

04:17.323 --> 04:20.427
- FERNANDO, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO 79TH AND BROADWAY, PLEASE?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.829
TODAY IS
A REALLY EXCITING DAY

04:22.862 --> 04:24.297
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LISTING APPOINTMENT

04:24.330 --> 04:26.966
AT THE ICONIC APTHORP
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE,

04:27.067 --> 04:31.137
SMACK IN BETWEEN CENTRAL PARK
AND THE HUDSON RIVER.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.109
THE APTHORP
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME,

04:36.142 --> 04:38.445
BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES
I CAME TO NEW YORK,

04:38.478 --> 04:39.679
I WAS A LITTLE BOY.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.281
I HAPPENED TO WALK BY
WITH MY DAD,

04:41.314 --> 04:43.516
AND I STOOD THERE
ON THOSE BIG IRON GATES,

04:43.550 --> 04:46.086
LOOKING IN
AND SAW THE WATER FEATURES.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.287
AND, LIKE, WOW.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.889
AND I NEVER FORGOT
THE BUILDING.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.326
- COME IN.
- HELLO.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.894
HI, WHAT'S UP?
- HEY.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.529
- I'VE KNOWN ARI
FOR YEARS.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.565
HE'S A BIG PLAYER
IN REAL ESTATE.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.634
ARI'S A REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR
WHO BOUGHT DOZENS OF UNITS

05:01.668 --> 05:03.036
IN THE APTHORP,

05:03.069 --> 05:06.673
AND THIS PARTICULAR ONE
IS MINE.

05:06.706 --> 05:07.674
IT'S HUGE.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.209
- DINING ROOM,
LIVING ROOM.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.944
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- PAY ATTENTION.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.078
- OKAY.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.247
ARI HAS A REPUTATION
OF BEING--

05:14.280 --> 05:18.518
HOW SHOULD I SAY IT?--
A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR FACE.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.923
- WE REFINISHED
ALL OF THE EXISTING FINISHES

05:23.957 --> 05:25.058
ON THE CEILING,

05:25.091 --> 05:27.927
SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE
IS OLD, 1920s.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.529
- EVEN THE LIGHT?
- THAT'S ALL ORIGINAL.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.531
- HOW MUCH IS THAT WORTH?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.233
- IF I'M THE BROKER,
I NEED TO KNOW THESE THINGS.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.701
- WELL, RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE NOT THE BROKER.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.736
SO LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.507
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS.
- YEAH.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.608
VERY GRAND STAIRCASE.

05:49.582 --> 05:53.086
- IT'S ALL
EKLUND-STYLE PERFECTION.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.455
- SO WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO DO?

05:55.488 --> 05:58.258
- WELL, I WOULD LIKE
TO LIST THE APARTMENT

05:58.291 --> 05:59.626
AND SELL IT FOR YOU.

05:59.659 --> 06:04.164
- FOR HOW MUCH?
- $9 MILLION.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.367
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S LOW?
- LOW?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.336
OVER $2,000 A FOOT,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.071
WHEN THE AVERAGE
IN THIS BUILDING IS--

06:11.104 --> 06:14.574
- IS WHAT?
- $2,055.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.043
- I'M NOT GONNA GO
A PENNY BELOW $10.5 MILLION.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.378
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.513
THE BUILDING CURRENTLY
IS TRADING OVER $2,000 A FOOT.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.149
SO, IF YOU DO THE MATH
QUICKLY IN YOUR HEAD--

06:23.183 --> 06:24.851
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE COMPARING
THIS TO, LIKE,

06:24.884 --> 06:26.619
AN 11TH-FLOOR UNIT
WITH OPEN VIEWS,

06:26.653 --> 06:27.787
CORNER APARTMENTS.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.456
BUT YOU'RE
ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.690
I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND NEGATIVE,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.058
BUT YOU HEAR THE CARS?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.493
- I ACTUALLY DON'T HEAR
THE CARS.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.062
I CAN SEE THE CARS.
I DON'T HEAR THE CARS.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.931
- ARI, ARI, ARI.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.967
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT,
BUT LET'S GET REAL HERE.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.670
IT'S GROUND FLOOR
AND FIRST FLOOR.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.438
THE COMPS IN THE BUILDING
ARE THE FOLLOWING--

06:45.472 --> 06:47.173
$2,000 A FOOT ON A GOOD DAY.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.642
YOU ARE GETTING A PREMIUM
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DID--

06:49.676 --> 06:50.677
EVERYTHING'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.212
THE FINISHES,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.547
AND THEN I GOT TO DISCOUNT IT
BECAUSE IT'S GROUND FLOOR,

06:54.581 --> 06:55.882
SO YOU'RE BACK.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.984
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.
- COME ON.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.285
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.355
- NO, I'M NOT BEING
RIDICULOUS.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.660
LET'S COMPROMISE.
- OKAY.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.362
- LET'S LIST IT
AT $9.5 MILLION.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.598
- FREDRIK,
YOU'RE REALLY DISAPPOINTING ME.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.633
YOU'VE BROKEN RECORDS BEFORE.
- THIS IS LIKE A<i>TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

07:13.667 --> 07:15.168
THIS IS A RECORD.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.636
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.438
WHY DO YOU CALL ME
IF YOU'RE GONNA QUESTION ME?

07:18.471 --> 07:20.473
I AM A PROFESSIONAL.
- I CALLED YOU BECAUSE I THINK--

07:20.507 --> 07:22.208
- I'VE DONE THIS
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.343
YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:23.376 --> 07:25.645
$9.5 MILLION--
THAT'S MY LAST.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.653
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT NOW ONE
OF THE HOTTEST BROKERS,

07:33.687 --> 07:36.489
IF NOT THE HOTTEST BROKER,
IN NEW YORK CITY.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.792
- GO ON.
- RELAX.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.095
SO $9.5 MILLION,
NOT A PENNY LESS.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.463
- I LOVE THIS PRESSURE.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.532
I'M SO EXCITED
TO FINALLY HAVE MY DREAM LISTING

07:45.565 --> 07:46.866
AT THE APTHORP,

07:46.900 --> 07:49.769
BUT I JUST HOPE ARI
DOESN'T KILL ME IN THE PROCESS.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.243
- YURI, WE'RE GOING TO
THE BIGGEST LISTING APPOINTMENT

07:57.277 --> 07:58.745
OF MY LIFE.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.280
- RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.115
- ARE YOU EXCITED?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.550
- I HOLD
MY FINGER CROSSED.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.485
- YOU HOLD YOUR FINGERS CROSSED.
- YES.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.722
- MY NEW LISTING PITCH
IS FOR 200 11TH AVENUE

08:08.755 --> 08:10.290
IN WEST CHELSEA.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.425
CHELSEA IS LOCATED
IN THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN

08:12.459 --> 08:14.928
BETWEEN WEST VILLAGE
AND MIDTOWN.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.730
HERE IT IS.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.366
THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT
BY A VERY FAMOUS ARCHITECT

08:19.399 --> 08:21.501
AND DEVELOPER
NAMED YOUNG WOO

08:21.534 --> 08:23.803
AND HAS BECOME ONE
OF THE MOST FAMOUS

08:23.837 --> 08:26.773
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
IN THE WORLD BECAUSE...

08:26.806 --> 08:28.041
WOW.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.577
EACH APARTMENT HAS
ITS OWN PRIVATE CAR ELEVATOR,

08:30.610 --> 08:34.314
WHERE YOU PARK YOUR CAR
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.518
HERE WE GO.
WOW.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.087
YURI, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A CAR ELEVATOR?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.889
- NO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.760
- THIS IS AWESOME.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.201
THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING
WE'VE EVER DONE, EVER.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.471
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PITCH THIS BITCH.

08:58.505 --> 08:59.773
HEY.
- HEY, RYAN, HOW ARE YOU?

08:59.806 --> 09:01.574
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HEY, RYAN, HOW ARE YOU?

09:01.608 --> 09:04.377
- ZACK AND PASQUAL WORK
FOR YOUNG WOO AND ASSOCIATES.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.845
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
MORE IMPRESSIVE,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.280
THE GARAGE OR THIS VIEW.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.848
YOUNG WOO HAS THE IDEA.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.217
THESE TWO GUYS ARE THE ONES
THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.686
- I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.787
LET'S GRAB
A HARD HAT FIRST.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.255
- AWESOME.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.260
THERE HAS BEEN
A HUGE RANGE OF SALES

09:20.293 --> 09:21.828
IN THE SKY GARAGE BUILDING,

09:21.861 --> 09:23.830
EVERYTHING FROM
JUST UNDER $3 MILLION

09:23.863 --> 09:26.499
TO JUST OVER $18 MILLION.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.867
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.636
AND THEN YOU HAVE--WOW.
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.071
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
RIGHT THERE.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.740
- THIS PENTHOUSE
IS THE CROWN JEWEL.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.379
SO YOU HAVE A HUGE HOLE
IN THE FLOOR.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.647
- YES.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.549
- WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR
MORE WEEKS OF CONSTRUCTION.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.384
- WE'RE CREATING SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T EXIST

09:44.417 --> 09:45.785
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.253
WE'RE CREATING A SKY VAULT
TO GO ALONG

09:47.287 --> 09:48.555
WITH THE SKY GARAGE CONCEPT.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.690
YOU COME OFF OF THE ELEVATOR.
- OKAY.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.193
- YOU WALK ONTO A BEAUTIFUL
GLASS RUNWAY,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.961
WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN
THROUGH THAT GLASS,

09:55.061 --> 09:56.129
THIS IS THE VAULT.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.797
- FOR WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO SHOW OFF, RIGHT?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.499
- EXACTLY RIGHT.
- THAT'S BANANAS.

09:59.532 --> 10:03.370
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT LUXURY,
THAT'S LUXURY.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.671
[groans]

10:04.704 --> 10:07.207
- SO, AS YOU KNOW,
I'M REPRESENTING MR. WOO,

10:07.240 --> 10:10.577
AND WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR
MORE WEEKS OF CONSTRUCTION.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.512
WE'VE INTERVIEWED
LOTS OF BROKERS.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.882
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
FOR US?

10:15.915 --> 10:18.985
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ATTRACT
THE BILLIONAIRES OF THE WORLD.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.388
AND HOW DO YOU ATTRACT
THOSE PEOPLE?

10:21.421 --> 10:24.157
IT'S NOT JUST PICTURES,
<i>NEW YORK TIMES,</i>

10:24.190 --> 10:25.992
DO AN OPEN HOUSE,
THAT SORT OF THING.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.761
I MEAN, I'VE GOT TO CREATE,
YOU KNOW, A--

10:27.794 --> 10:30.797
LIKE, A MOVIE TRAILER
FOR THIS BLOCKBUSTER,

10:30.830 --> 10:32.432
LIKE MICHAEL BAY STYLE.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.767
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL GET HELICOPTERS,

10:33.800 --> 10:37.470
A VIDEO THE WAY
NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.439
- DID HE JUST SAY
"HELICOPTERS"?

10:39.472 --> 10:42.375
- WELL, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
THAT'S BIGGER THAN LIFE.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.978
IF I GET THIS, I HAVE
TO MAKE AN EVENT OUT OF IT.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.880
WHATEVER DATE
WE'RE GONNA HIT THE MARKET,

10:46.913 --> 10:49.649
THAT'S THE DATE THAT PEOPLE
NEED TO BE WAITING FOR

10:49.683 --> 10:50.950
AND SALIVATING FOR.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.819
IT'LL GET EVERYBODY TALKING,

10:52.852 --> 10:54.954
AND ONCE IT HITS IN NEW YORK,
IT GOES AROUND THE WORLD.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.223
- THAT'S THE KIND OF PASSION
THAT WE WANT TO HEAR,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.992
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE THINK
IT'S GONNA NEED

10:59.025 --> 11:00.593
IN ORDER TO SELL
THIS IDEA.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.529
- SO WHAT PRICE
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

11:02.562 --> 11:03.830
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH?

11:03.863 --> 11:05.065
- WEST CHELSEA?

11:05.098 --> 11:08.902
SOMEWHERE AROUND
$5,000 A FOOT.

11:13.239 --> 11:17.077
- MR. WOO WON'T TAKE
ANYTHING LESS THAN $23 MILLION.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.447
- SO THAT'S, LIKE,
A LITTLE OVER 6,300 BUCKS.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.315
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.250
- $23 MILLION?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.086
THAT'S INSANE.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.721
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

11:27.754 --> 11:29.422
I KNOW THAT THERE
IS NO NEGOTIATING

11:29.456 --> 11:30.590
IN THIS MEETING.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.624
THEY'RE SITTING IN FRONT

11:31.658 --> 11:33.159
OF EVERY SINGLE BROKER
IN THE CITY,

11:33.193 --> 11:36.396
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FEEL OUT
WHO THEY THINK CAN DO THIS.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.800
IT'LL BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE SALE
EVER IN WEST CHELSEA.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.003
- YEAH, THAT'S THE NUMBER.
THAT'S WHAT THIS APARTMENT--

11:43.103 --> 11:44.871
THAT'S WHAT WE FEEL
THIS APARTMENT IS WORTH.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.546
- OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.482
- WELCOME TO THE TEAM.
- LET'S DO IT.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.483
- ALL RIGHT.
- AWESOME.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.550
- EXCELLENT.
ALL RIGHT.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.452
- THANKS, RYAN.
- THANK YOU.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.122
I WONDER IF MY DRIVER'S
STILL JUST SITTING IN THE CAR.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.591
- [laughs]

12:04.624 --> 12:06.659
- COMING UP...
- ALL RIGHT.

12:06.693 --> 12:10.096
YOU CAN HAVE THE LISTING
UNDER ONE CONDITION.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.231
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.075
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

12:22.108 --> 12:23.343
- GOOD, GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.245
- LET'S GO TO 353
CENTRAL PARK WEST, PLEASE.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.915
MY NEW LISTING PITCH
IS ON 353 CENTRAL PARK WEST.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.417
CENTRAL PARK--
IT'S OLD NEW YORK.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.919
IT'S FUR COATS AND HORSES,

12:32.952 --> 12:34.387
THIS, LIKE, LEVEL
OF SOPHISTICATION

12:34.421 --> 12:35.689
THAT'S ONLY FOUND
IN MOVIES.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.956
[knock at door]

12:36.990 --> 12:39.526
- OH, LUIS.
- HOW ARE YOU, MYRA?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.761
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.096
MYRA IS A REFERRAL
WHO CALLED ME

12:43.129 --> 12:45.398
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE APARTMENT
WAS ON THE MARKET BEFORE

12:45.432 --> 12:46.399
WITH ANOTHER BROKER,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.435
BUT THEIR BROKER
WAS NOT ABLE TO DELIVER,

12:48.468 --> 12:49.502
SO THEY CALLED ME.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.104
- LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY HUSBAND.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.339
- HELLO.
OH, EVERYBODY'S HERE.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.340
I LOVE IT.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.441
I LOVE THE SUIT.
VERY NICE.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.109
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.110
- THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.611
WOW, YOU GUYS HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.180
YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE PARK.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.614
- THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW WE FELT.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.050
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
THE REST OF THE PLACE, PLEASE.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.825
VERY NICE.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.494
NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR
APARTMENT.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.563
- NO, I KNOW.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.734
THIS, WE CREATED
INTO THE LIBRARY...

13:20.767 --> 13:23.536
WITH ALL TYPES OF WOODS
AND BOXES.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.740
IT'S VERY UNIQUE.
IT'S GORGEOUS.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.575
- I-I HAVE TO SAY--

13:28.608 --> 13:29.909
AND I'M JUST POINTING
THINGS OUT.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.680
YOU KNOW, IT IS
A LITTLE BIT SPECIFIC.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.448
IT MAY NOT APPEAL
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.852
- THEY COULD STAIN IT BLACK.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.255
- YEAH.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.759
- NOW, HERE'S YOUR KITCHEN.

13:45.792 --> 13:50.163
- THAT IS A VERY SMALL KITCHEN
AND VERY OLD APPLIANCES.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.999
IT'S A LITTLE DATED.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.969
- SELL IT
TO A DATED PERSON.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.140
- EVEN THOUGH
THIS PLACE HAS ITS DRAWBACKS,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.274
IT'S RIGHT ON THE PARK.

14:01.307 --> 14:02.776
IT'S BRIGHT.
IT'S TRADITIONAL.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.178
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE UPPER WEST
SIDE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.680
I WANT THIS LISTING
VERY BAD.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.648
ALL RIGHT,
SO, AS FAR AS PRICING,

14:08.682 --> 14:10.684
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE THINKING.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.286
- YOU KNOW, WE WERE LOOKING,
LIKE, $7 MILLION.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.625
- $7 MILLION IS--
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.093
I HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK
TO THE "T."

14:20.126 --> 14:22.062
I UNDERSTAND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
LEFT AND RIGHT.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.263
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S SELLING,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.065
WHAT HAS NOT SELL,
WHAT HAS STAY ON THE MARKET

14:25.065 --> 14:26.199
AND FOR HOW LONG.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.501
- HOW ABOUT GOING
TO $6.7 MILLION?

14:28.535 --> 14:29.736
- EVEN $6.7 MILLION
IS TOO HIGH.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.872
- I DON'T--
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.407
THIS IS A SPECIAL APARTMENT.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.943
- ESPECIALLY WITH REAL ESTATE
GOING FOR $8,000 A FOOT

14:36.976 --> 14:37.944
IN THE CITY.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.179
- YEAH, BUT $8,000 A FOOT,

14:39.212 --> 14:40.814
IT'S GOING ON 61ST
AND CENTRAL PARK WEST.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.082
WE'RE ON 95TH STREET.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.284
OUR CLOSEST COMPETITOR,
THEIR RECENT SALES

14:44.317 --> 14:45.685
GO FOR $2,800 A FOOT,

14:45.719 --> 14:47.754
BUT IT WAS
COMPLETELY RENOVATED.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.557
EVERYBODY THAT COMES HERE
IS GOING TO WANT TO DO

14:50.590 --> 14:51.558
SOME WORK TO IT.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.293
I WOULD SAY THAT $6 MILLION--

14:53.326 --> 14:56.162
THAT COMES DOWN
TO ABOUT $2,300 A FOOT.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.798
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE

14:58.832 --> 15:01.534
IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS LISTING
THE WAY IT NEEDS BE MOVED.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.376
- ALL RIGHT.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.545
YOU CAN HAVE IT
AT $6 MILLION...

15:12.579 --> 15:16.116
- BOOM.
ANOTHER LISTING FOR LUIS.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.185
- UNDER ONE CONDITION.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.388
- HOLD ON. WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A CONDITION?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.389
NO CONDITIONS.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.390
YOU SIGN.
I SELL.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.858
LET'S GO HOME.
OKAY.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.060
- THAT TODD--HE SHOULD BE PART
OF THE LISTING.

15:27.060 --> 15:31.698
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT THE LISTING WORKS.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.299
- PART OF THE LISTING,
AS IN--

15:33.333 --> 15:34.501
- AS IT TURNS OUT,

15:34.534 --> 15:37.971
I'M ACTUALLY
IN THE REAL-ESTATE INDUSTRY.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.606
AND I HAPPEN
TO TEACH TENNIS,

15:39.639 --> 15:42.142
AND THERE WAS A TURN
OF CAREERS.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.611
AND I DECIDED I WANTED
TO GET MY LICENSE.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.079
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY PARENTS SAID,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.213
"YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.315
"WE'RE GETTING TO A POINT
IN OUR LIFE.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.551
LET'S JUST SELL
THE PROPERTY."

15:51.584 --> 15:53.887
- OH, SO IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE BROKER

15:53.920 --> 15:58.124
WHO COULDN'T SELL THE APARTMENT
WAS ACTUALLY TODD, THE SON.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.259
OUCH.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.827
- SO I SAY TO MY PARENTS,
"YOU KNOW,

16:00.860 --> 16:03.596
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS LISTING
ALL BY MYSELF,"

16:03.630 --> 16:06.599
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
HOW YOU'RE HERE RIGHT NOW.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.602
- HE WORKED HARD ON IT,
AND HE'S GOT GOOD CONNECTIONS.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.237
SO YOU CAN HELP
EACH OTHER,

16:11.271 --> 16:13.440
AND HE CAN LEARN
SO MUCH FROM YOU.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.508
THAT'S MY STIPULATION.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.577
- I AM VERY CONFIDENT
THAT I CAN SELL THIS PLACE,

16:17.610 --> 16:22.382
BUT CAN I SELL IT
WITH TODD ON MY SIDE?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.451
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN TODD?

16:24.484 --> 16:28.054
ALL RIGHT, SO, TODD,
THIS IS--

16:28.088 --> 16:29.422
IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS,

16:29.456 --> 16:31.958
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT TO DO THIS SERIOUSLY.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.128
- ABSOLUTELY.
THIS WOULD BE GREAT.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.332
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE A DEAL.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.333
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.135
WE'RE ON?
- WE'RE ON.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.136
THANK YOU.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.571
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEED THIS LISTING.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.706
I WANT THIS LISTING.
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.842
IT COMES WITH THE KID.
LET'S DO IT.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.243
- I THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT GREAT.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.545
- I THINK
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.027
[cell phone ringing]

17:10.263 --> 17:12.198
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.
- FREDRIK, IT'S ARI.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.734
HOW ARE YOU?
- ARI?

17:17.804 --> 17:21.408
UPDATE AS OF--
AS OF 18 HOURS AGO?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.647
IT'S GOING LIVE IN THE SYSTEM.

17:27.681 --> 17:29.249
IT TAKES A FEW HOURS
FOR IT TO UPDATE.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.350
I'M GONNA DO
AN EMAIL BLAST.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.885
I'M STARTING
TO CALL BROKERS,

17:31.918 --> 17:34.688
BEING VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP

17:34.721 --> 17:35.822
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.124
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
OF AN UPDATE.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.272
ARI, ARI--

17:52.305 --> 17:55.642
IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER
THAN 18 HOURS TO GET RESULTS.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.610
BUT AS SOON AS I HAVE
ANY KIND OF FEEDBACK,

17:57.644 --> 17:59.846
I WILL BE CALLING YOU.

18:05.051 --> 18:09.055
YOU'LL HAVE AN UPDATE
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.762
[sighs]

18:21.668 --> 18:23.903
- CONSTRUCTION
ON MY SKY-GARAGE LISTING

18:23.937 --> 18:26.573
IS PLANNED TO BE FINISHED
IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.908
SO I'VE GOT TO START PLANNING
MY MOVIE-TRAILER SHOOT.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.578
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HEY, RYAN, HOW ARE YOU?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.279
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- RYAN, HOW YOU DOING?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.948
- I REMEMBER SEEING THESE
AUSTRALIAN GUYS

18:35.048 --> 18:37.517
WHO MADE THIS CRAZY VIDEO
FOR THIS HOUSE IN AUSTRALIA,

18:37.550 --> 18:38.685
SO I CALLED UP
THESE TWO GUYS,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.253
AND I WAS LIKE,
"HELLO, MY NAME IS RYAN."

18:40.286 --> 18:42.055
THEY WERE LIKE, "HELLO,"
AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.057
I NEED YOU GUYS TO COME
ON A PLANE AND DO THIS THING."

18:44.090 --> 18:45.725
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"OH, G'DAY, RIGHT?"

18:45.759 --> 18:47.260
SO I'VE GOT
THIS PENTHOUSE APARTMENT,

18:47.293 --> 18:49.429
AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS ABOUT IT.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.231
SO I WANT TO MAKE
A VIDEO, RIGHT?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.932
LIKE A MOVIE TRAILER.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.267
- I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT WE TRY AND DO.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.669
WE MAKE PROPERTY FILMS,
YOU KNOW,

18:55.702 --> 18:57.537
BRINGING THE CINEMATIC ASPECT
TO REAL ESTATE.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.408
- RIGHT.
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.576
- SO TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.545
LIKE, WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
IN TERMS OF THE STORY?

19:05.578 --> 19:06.813
- THE ANTICIPATION.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.116
WHAT I THINK I WANT TO DO
IS HAVE THIS BE ABOUT,

19:10.150 --> 19:11.851
LIKE, THE HYPE,
BE ABOUT THE BUZZ.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.787
I WANT, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
A GUY IN JAPAN

19:13.820 --> 19:16.823
BOARDING A GULFSTREAM, YOU KNOW,
TALKING TO HIS BUSINESS PARTNER.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.825
YOU KNOW, "PENTHOUSE ONE
IS COMING TO THE MARKET."

19:18.858 --> 19:20.894
AND I WANT, LIKE, A GERMAN GUY
JUMPING ON A HELICOPTER

19:20.927 --> 19:22.495
AND SAYING, "WE HAVE
TO GET THERE FIRST."

19:22.529 --> 19:24.097
I WANT GUYS, LIKE,
IN, LIKE, ROPE SWINGS,

19:24.130 --> 19:26.166
LIKE, HANGING DOWN,
TRYING TO GET TO THIS APARTMENT,

19:26.199 --> 19:27.567
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS THING BEFORE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.035
I WANT LAMBORGHINIS.
I WANT ASTON MARTINS.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.870
I WANT MERCEDES-BENZES, LIKE,
FLYING THROUGH THE STREETS

19:30.904 --> 19:32.806
OF NEW YORK WITH, LIKE,
POLICE CHASING THEM

19:32.839 --> 19:35.275
AND KATE UPTON AND GISELE
TRYING TO GET INTO THESE CARS

19:35.308 --> 19:37.477
AND YACHTS COMING THIS WAY
WITH A GERMAN GUY.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.878
I WANT MOTORBOATS,

19:38.912 --> 19:41.081
CIGARETTE BOATS COMING DOWN
THIS WAY WITH A RUSSIAN GUY,

19:41.114 --> 19:42.115
ALL TRYING TO GET THERE

19:42.148 --> 19:43.450
AS THE SUN IS SETTING
OVER JERSEY,

19:43.483 --> 19:45.151
COMING DOWN THIS
WITH A SILHOUETTE OF ME

19:45.185 --> 19:46.319
LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOWS,

19:46.353 --> 19:47.921
LOOKING AT ALL
THESE BILLIONAIRE BUYERS

19:47.954 --> 19:49.222
COMING TOWARDS
THIS APARTMENT.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.623
LIGHTS GO ON.
BOOM, CUT TO BLACK.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.892
"COMING SOON."
DONE.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.396
COOL?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.064
- COOL. WE CAN DO THAT.
- YES.

19:58.064 --> 20:01.201
[laughter]

20:01.234 --> 20:02.469
ALL RIGHT.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.871
- SO A COUPLE HELICOPTERS,
AIR-TO-AIR TYPE STUFF?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.639
- OH, LIKE,
TEN HELICOPTERS.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.541
- WELL...

20:08.575 --> 20:10.377
- HELICOPTERS ARE COOL.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.079
- YES, THEY ARE, RYAN.
THEY ARE VERY COOL.

20:13.113 --> 20:14.647
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

20:14.681 --> 20:16.383
WHICH YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT YET.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.886
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET?
- UH...

20:19.919 --> 20:21.454
WELL, I MEAN,
WITH ALL THIS STUFF?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.056
I DON'T KNOW--
LIKE, $20,000, $30,000.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.425
[laughter]

20:25.458 --> 20:26.860
- REALLY?
IS THAT IT?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.361
- YEAH, THAT'S A [bleep]LOAD
OF MONEY.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.130
YOU CAN DO THAT.
- NOT FOR TEN HELICOPTERS.

20:30.163 --> 20:33.099
- TEN HELICOPTERS
ARE 2 GRAND AN HOUR.

20:33.133 --> 20:34.200
- I DON'T DO MATH
IN MY HEAD.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.669
- WE'LL HAVE ONE HELICOPTER.
- OKAY.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.871
SO LET'S DO IT.
- IT'LL BE AWESOME.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.039
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.674
- LET'S DO THIS, MATES.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.675
COMING UP...

20:41.708 --> 20:42.842
- CHEERS FOR THE APTHORP,

20:42.876 --> 20:45.111
THE MOST ICONIC BUILDING
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

20:45.145 --> 20:48.682
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ARI'S
ACTUALLY SHOWING UP HERE.

20:58.158 --> 21:00.694
- YO, MAN.
THIS IS A SICK VIEW.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.761
- RIGHT?
- I LOVE IT.

21:01.795 --> 21:03.296
I WILL BE INSPIRED
EVERY MORNING

21:03.329 --> 21:04.564
JUST STANDING HERE,
YOU KNOW?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.899
- THAT'S THE REASON
I'M HERE, MAN.

21:05.932 --> 21:06.900
- DRINKING COFFEE AND--

21:06.933 --> 21:08.335
[doorbell rings]

21:08.368 --> 21:10.537
- MR. TODD.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

21:10.570 --> 21:12.138
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

21:12.172 --> 21:13.973
TODD'S MOM WANTS ME
TO MENTOR HIM,

21:14.074 --> 21:17.110
AND IF THIS GUY'S GOING
TO WORK ALONGSIDE OF ME,

21:17.143 --> 21:18.645
I NEED TO WORK
ON HIS APPEARANCE.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.180
IAN, THIS IS TODD.
TODD, THIS IS IAN.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.181
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.282
- THIS IS THE GUY RESPONSIBLE

21:22.315 --> 21:23.683
FOR ME LOOKING LIKE THIS
EVERY DAY.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.385
SO TODD'S TRANSFORMATION
STARTS TODAY.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.087
HE JUST DOESN'T
KNOW THAT YET.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.589
SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

21:29.622 --> 21:31.391
IN REAL ESTATE
IS PRESENTATION,

21:31.424 --> 21:32.726
NOT JUST IN THE LISTING,

21:32.759 --> 21:34.127
NOT JUST THE WAY
YOU MARKET THINGS,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.362
BUT IN THE WAY YOU LOOK.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.197
WE'RE SELLING
MILLION-DOLLAR REAL ESTATE.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.599
LET'S MAKE--
I WANT TO MAKE YOU A SUIT.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.602
PLEASE, PLEASE,
TRUST ME IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.973
- OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
- OKAY.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.775
- LET ME PUT MY STUFF
IN MY JACKET

21:48.808 --> 21:50.577
AND GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.245
OKAY.
- WHAT THE--

21:52.278 --> 21:53.947
- THAT'S YOUR WALLET?
- THAT IS NOT A WALLET.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.948
THAT'S A WEAPON.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.716
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THAT WALLET?

21:56.750 --> 21:59.285
NO, NO, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.388
THAT'S A BIG WALLET,
MY FRIEND.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.424
[laughing]

22:06.793 --> 22:09.362
- MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO EMPTY OUT MY WALLET.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.464
- EMPTY OUT THE WHOLE WALLET.
- I LOVE THAT IDEA.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.833
RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR.
LET ME GET YOUR SIZES.

22:13.867 --> 22:17.070
THERE YOU GO.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.205
HOW DO YOU FEEL
IN THIS JACKET RIGHT NOW?

22:19.239 --> 22:20.974
- HOW DO I KNOW
HOW THIS SUIT FITS?

22:21.074 --> 22:22.142
- THIS IS NOT
THE ACTUAL SUIT.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.643
- OH, OKAY.
- NO, NO, NO, THIS IS NOT--

22:23.677 --> 22:26.513
- THIS IS WHAT HE USES
TO JUST DO THE MEASURING.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.847
BUT YOU ARE
A LITTLE BIT TIGHT.

22:27.881 --> 22:29.249
LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT.
RELAX.

22:29.282 --> 22:30.750
I NEED THIS GUY
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.186
IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK
FOR SOMEONE TO TELL YOU

22:33.219 --> 22:35.321
THAT EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'RE WEARING IS OLD,

22:35.355 --> 22:36.556
IS BAD.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.224
I NEED TO MAKE HIM FEEL
LIKE HE'S PART OF US,

22:38.258 --> 22:40.093
YOU KNOW,
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING FUN.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.161
RELAX.
- OKAY, I'M RELAXED.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.696
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME FREESTYLE.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.497
LET'S GIVE HIM SOME FREESTYLE
SO THAT HE CAN--

22:44.531 --> 22:46.599
- [beatboxing]

22:46.633 --> 22:49.636
- [rapping in Spanish]

22:57.677 --> 22:58.645
- [laughs]

22:58.678 --> 22:59.646
- HOW WAS THAT?

22:59.679 --> 23:00.647
NO, GIVE IT TO TODD.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.648
GIVE IT TO TODD.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.816
I WANT TO HEAR HIM FREESTYLE.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.851
- [beatboxing]
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.885
[laughter]

23:05.919 --> 23:07.120
- YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT?

23:07.153 --> 23:08.588
- NO, NO, NO.
- IT'S ALL A STATE OF MIND.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.256
IT'S THE SAME OF THIS SUIT
THAT I'M MAKING.

23:10.290 --> 23:11.791
IT'S THE SAME WAY
WE DO BUSINESS.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.259
IT'S THE SAME WAY
WE DO EVERYTHING.

23:13.293 --> 23:17.664
THAT'S CALLED CONFIDENCE,
AND CONFIDENCE EQUALS SALES.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.333
- OKAY.
- TRUST ME.

23:20.367 --> 23:22.369
- EVEN IF IT DOESN'T COME OUT,
IT'LL HELP LOOSEN UP.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.703
I SWEAR.
OKAY, LET'S GO.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.939
- [beatboxing]

23:25.972 --> 23:26.940
- [speaks Spanish]

23:26.973 --> 23:28.541
- FIX ME A SUIT.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.243
FIX ME A SUIT.

23:33.346 --> 23:34.848
FIX ME THE SUIT.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.916
[laughter]

23:36.950 --> 23:39.085
- I LOVE IT.
SEE, YOU'RE LOOSENING UP.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.088
HE'S NOT JAY Z,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

23:42.088 --> 23:44.391
HE'S BAD, ACTUALLY, BUT--
[laughs]

23:44.424 --> 23:46.092
BUT IT'S GOOD, ALL RIGHT?

23:46.126 --> 23:47.627
ALL RIGHT?

23:47.660 --> 23:50.163
THE FACT THAT HE'S EVEN
TRYING TO FREESTYLE,

23:50.196 --> 23:51.464
IT'S ALL I NEEDED TO KNOW.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.767
THAT MEANS THIS GUY
IS WILLING TO BE TRANSFORMED,

23:53.800 --> 23:54.834
AND I LIKE THAT.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.136
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'LL GET THAT ONE,

23:56.169 --> 23:58.705
AND WE'LL GET
ROCKING AND ROLLING.

24:07.213 --> 24:10.717
- TODAY IS THE OPEN HOUSE
OF THE APTHORP.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.185
I REALLY NEED
A FULL HOUSE HERE.

24:12.218 --> 24:15.055
I NEED 250 BROKERS
WITH A LOT OF ACTION INSIDE

24:15.088 --> 24:16.523
SO PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
PAY ATTENTION

24:16.556 --> 24:21.061
THAT IT IS THE GROUND FLOOR
WITH CARS OUTSIDE.

24:21.094 --> 24:23.797
HELLO?
ANYONE HOME?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.632
TEN MORE MINUTES.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.700
HI.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.068
WHY ARE YOU SITTING HERE?

24:28.101 --> 24:29.736
PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING.
HELLO?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.604
TWO THINGS--
I'M EXPECTING 250 PEOPLE.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.173
AND ACCORDING TO THE INVITATION,

24:33.206 --> 24:35.075
I'M SUPPOSED
TO COOK FOR EVERYONE.

24:35.108 --> 24:36.376
- [laughs]

24:36.409 --> 24:40.547
- I THOUGHT
IF FREDRIK COOKS A LITTLE BIT,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.549
I'LL HAVE
A BETTER TURNOUT.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.550
WHICH--HOW DO YOU--

24:43.583 --> 24:44.851
- WELL,
WE CUT IN THE MIDDLE.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.852
- NO, THAT'S TOO BIG.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.120
YOU CAN'T FIT IT
IN THE MOUTH,

24:47.153 --> 24:49.189
AND I CAN FIT A LOT
IN MY MOUTH.

24:49.222 --> 24:51.958
- OH, MY--

24:51.991 --> 24:53.093
- THERE IT IS.

24:53.093 --> 24:55.662
I HAVE OFFICIALLY COOKED
FOR MY OPEN HOUSE.

24:55.695 --> 24:56.730
GOOD LUCK.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.499
I HAVE TO MAKE
EVERYTHING ELSE PERFECT.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.171
OH, MY GOD, SO MANY PEOPLE.
HI, HI.

25:05.205 --> 25:06.740
LET'S GO IN HERE,
THE DINING ROOM.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.441
HAVE SOME WINE.

25:08.475 --> 25:10.877
I CERTAINLY NEED ONE
AFTER ALL THIS PREPPING.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.079
I COOKED FOR HOURS.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.348
ISN'T IT GORGEOUS?

25:15.382 --> 25:16.850
AND IT'S BIG--
4,200 SQUARE FEET.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.753
LOOK AT THIS MASTER.
THE MASTER IS GINORMOUS.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.256
NO, NO SWEDISH MEATBALLS.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.524
I'LL MAKE THOSE TONIGHT.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.326
- WE'RE NOT INVITED TO THAT,
I'M SURE.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.761
- MM.

25:27.794 --> 25:30.397
THIS BROKERS' OPEN
IS A HUGE SUCCESS.

25:30.430 --> 25:32.298
ALL 250 PEOPLE SHOWED UP,

25:32.332 --> 25:36.970
AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF I GET AN OFFER TODAY.

25:38.071 --> 25:39.139
CHEERS FOR THE APTHORP,

25:39.172 --> 25:41.708
THE MOST ICONIC BUILDING
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.414
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

25:47.447 --> 25:49.082
HI.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.

25:49.082 --> 25:51.284
I MEAN, YOU CAN LEAVE.
I MEAN, I--

25:52.986 --> 25:54.354
[sighs]

25:54.387 --> 25:57.257
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
ARI'S ACTUALLY SHOWING UP HERE.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.892
- IT'S A BIT WARM IN HERE.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.795
YOU PUT THE AIR ON?
- I DIDN'T HAVE TIME.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.597
PEOPLE--AS SOON AS I--
YOU WANT TO PUT THE AIR ON?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.766
- DID YOU BRING
ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.201
SO YOU'RE DOING
THIS YOURSELF.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.403
- I HAVE MY ASSISTANT THERE,
AND I HAVE THE CATERING TEAM.

26:10.437 --> 26:11.571
AND I HAVE THE CHEF
IN HERE.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.340
- WHAT KIND OF BUYERS
DO YOU THINK SHOWED UP?

26:13.373 --> 26:14.774
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE ALL FROM?

26:14.808 --> 26:16.910
- THIS OPEN HOUSE
IS 90 MINUTES.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.145
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
ABOUT 36 MINUTES LEFT.

26:19.179 --> 26:22.282
SO MAYBE YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
AND I'LL GO SELL THE APARTMENT.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.617
- I'M GONNA WALK AROUND
AND TALK TO SOME PEOPLE.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.852
- OKAY, GO TALK TO PEOPLE.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.055
IT'S ONE THING TO FLOOD
MY PHONE WITH REQUESTS

26:29.055 --> 26:30.090
OF STATUS REPORTS,

26:30.123 --> 26:31.458
BUT TO FOLLOW ME AROUND?

26:31.491 --> 26:33.493
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAND HERE
AND TALK TO EACH OTHER,

26:33.526 --> 26:34.494
THE THREE OF YOU?

26:34.527 --> 26:35.729
HELLO?
YOU THREE TALK.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.865
I MEAN, HE HAS JUST REDEFINED
MICROMANAGEMENT.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.935
- I'M HIS CLIENT.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.403
- HE'S THE OWNER
OF THE APARTMENT.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.238
- HE'S THE OWNER
OF THE APARTMENT.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.840
- OH, REALLY, A CLIENT?
- YEAH.

26:46.873 --> 26:49.909
- YEAH, EXCUSE ME.

26:49.943 --> 26:53.213
COME ON,
LET ME SHOW YOU UPSTAIRS.

26:53.246 --> 26:54.314
- LOOK AT THIS.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.716
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS ROOM.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.817
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

26:57.851 --> 26:59.185
- SO WHERE IS
THE BUYER FROM?

26:59.219 --> 27:01.388
- THE BUYER
IS FROM TORONTO, CANADA.

27:01.421 --> 27:02.522
- OOH, CANADA.

27:02.555 --> 27:03.757
- YEAH.
- I LIKE CANADA.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.126
- HAVE YOU BEEN UP THERE?
- NO, BUT I LIKE IT.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.827
- [laughs]

27:07.861 --> 27:09.362
- HOW QUIET IT IS.

27:09.396 --> 27:11.031
YOU CLOSE THE DOOR
OVER HERE.

27:11.031 --> 27:13.733
- OKAY.

27:13.767 --> 27:16.069
- [sighs]
AND PERFECTION.

27:16.102 --> 27:19.673
[indistinct chatter]

27:19.706 --> 27:23.810
FULL BATH HERE,
ANOTHER FULL BATHROOM HERE.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.412
HEY, MICHAEL,
THIS IS ARI.

27:25.445 --> 27:26.446
- HEY.
- ARI, PLEASURE.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.547
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
WELCOME.

27:27.580 --> 27:28.748
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU.

27:28.782 --> 27:30.050
- HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.
- THANK YOU.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.218
AND I HOPE YOU HAD
ONE OF MY SANDWICHES.

27:32.252 --> 27:33.386
- DON'T THROW ME OUT.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.721
- NO, NO, NO,
I'M NOT THROWING--

27:34.754 --> 27:38.224
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU KNEW WHERE THE EXIT...

27:38.258 --> 27:39.392
ANYWAY...

27:39.426 --> 27:41.061
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SHOWING ME AROUND.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.495
- SO YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME?

27:42.529 --> 27:44.064
- I WILL DEFINITELY
CALL YOU,

27:44.064 --> 27:46.533
AND WE WILL SPEAK FURTHER
ABOUT THE PRICE.

27:46.566 --> 27:47.701
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE PRICE?

27:47.734 --> 27:49.402
THE PRICE
IS THE PRICE, $9.5 MILLION.

27:49.436 --> 27:52.072
- WE'LL SPEAK ON THE PHONE.
- OKAY.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.940
OF COURSE HE'S PUSHING BACK
ON THE PRICE.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.177
I TOLD ARI IT WAS TOO HIGH
TO BEGIN WITH.

27:57.210 --> 27:59.512
ALWAYS LISTEN
TO FREDRIK EKLUND.

27:59.546 --> 28:01.514
- THANK YOU.
- 917, YOU GOT MY NUMBER.

28:01.548 --> 28:04.517
- ALL RIGHT, I DO.
- THANK YOU.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.026
- SO, IF WE WERE A CAR,

28:13.059 --> 28:16.796
WE'D BE REVERSING RIGHT NOW
INTO THE GARAGE.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.031
- IT'S PRETTY NICE.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.499
- WHILE I'M FINALIZING
THE CONCEPT

28:19.532 --> 28:20.767
FOR THE MOVIE TRAILER,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.635
I'M SHOWING THE APARTMENT
TO AS MANY PEOPLE

28:22.669 --> 28:24.504
AS POSSIBLE
TO TRY TO GET IT SOLD.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.473
- THE CAR JUST COMES HERE.
- YEAH.

28:26.506 --> 28:27.874
- IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.043
- AND, I MEAN,
IF I CAN SELL IT QUICKLY,

28:30.043 --> 28:31.845
THEN I DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE A MOVIE,

28:31.878 --> 28:34.914
AND MOVIES ARE EXPENSIVE
TO MAKE.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.686
3 BEDROOMS, 3 1/2 BATHS,
3,600 SQUARE FEET.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.421
AND THEN
THIS IS YOUR KILLER VIEW.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.757
IT'S GOT ATTACHED
OUTDOOR SPACE HERE.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.458
EASY ACCESS, TOO,
TO CHELSEA PIER.

28:45.492 --> 28:47.093
- HE'S DEFINITELY
GONNA LIKE THIS.

28:47.127 --> 28:50.363
- AND THEN THIS IS WHERE
THE VAULT IS GONNA GO.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.567
SO YOU'RE GONNA HIT A BUTTON
RIGHT THERE,

28:54.601 --> 28:56.936
AND THE GLASS FLOOR
IS GONNA RISE,

28:56.970 --> 28:58.672
REVEALING
THE STAIRWELL BELOW.

28:58.705 --> 29:01.074
- SO THIS HERE...
- THIS IS FLOOR.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.175
THIS IS ALL FLOOR.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.643
- YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS USABLE SPACE.

29:03.677 --> 29:05.211
IT'S GLASS,
BUT IT'S GOT TO OPEN, RIGHT?

29:05.245 --> 29:06.646
SO WHERE DOES--
- HALFWAY THROUGH.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.848
- WHERE THE WOOD PANELING IS?
- A LITTLE FURTHER IN.

29:08.882 --> 29:10.750
- SO YOU HAVE--
THE STAIRS ARE HERE,

29:10.784 --> 29:12.085
AND THEY'RE AT AN ANGLE.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.120
SO WHERE DO YOU ENTER
THE STAIRS?

29:14.154 --> 29:15.455
- RIGHT HERE.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.557
- I DON'T QUITE GET THIS.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.625
- YOU DON'T GET IT?

29:18.658 --> 29:20.060
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE,
I KNOW,

29:20.093 --> 29:24.030
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN
DONE BEFORE.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.633
I TOTALLY GET
THAT IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.

29:26.666 --> 29:29.402
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE TRYING
TO EXPLAIN HEAVEN.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.571
[thud]
WHOOP. COME THROUGH HERE.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.106
IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
BE CAREFUL.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.209
- SO HERE'S THE VAULT.
I'M IN THE VAULT?

29:36.242 --> 29:37.744
- WELL, YOU'RE IN THE VAULT
RIGHT HERE,

29:37.777 --> 29:39.579
AND THEN THE STAIRS
ARE GONNA WIND UP LIKE THIS.

29:39.612 --> 29:40.780
- IT'S HARD
TO VISUALIZE IT.

29:40.814 --> 29:42.315
- WELL, WHEN'S YOUR
GUY COMING TO TOWN?

29:42.349 --> 29:43.550
- MAYBE A COUPLE WEEKS.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.218
- SO IT'LL BE
NEARLY FINISHED, HOPEFULLY.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.053
SO, BY THEN, DOUBLE-CHECK,
AND WE'LL BRING HIM THROUGH

29:47.087 --> 29:48.054
AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS.

29:48.088 --> 29:49.289
- ALL RIGHT.
- COOL?

29:49.322 --> 29:50.290
- YEAH.
- THANKS, MAN.

29:50.323 --> 29:51.458
- ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

29:51.491 --> 29:53.760
YEP, I GUESS I'LL MAKE
THAT MOVIE NOW.

29:55.095 --> 29:57.430
- COMING UP...

29:58.932 --> 30:00.900
JUST TRUST ME.
YOU CALLED ME FOR A REASON.

30:00.934 --> 30:02.669
LET ME DO MY JOB.
[growls]

30:16.850 --> 30:18.985
- ARE YOU
ON MY COMPUTER?

30:19.019 --> 30:20.620
- CHECKING EMAILS.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.789
- CAN YOU MAYBE GET UP THERE
FROM MY SEAT?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.057
OR I'M GONNA SIT
IN YOUR SEAT,

30:24.090 --> 30:25.458
AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT
IN YOUR SEAT.

30:25.492 --> 30:26.860
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.
DO THAT. HOLD ON.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.294
I HAVE SOME THINGS
TO ATTEND TO.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.462
- OLIVIA.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.731
THAT'S THE RYAN SEAT.

30:31.765 --> 30:32.966
- YEAH, I COULD BE YOU.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.501
- YOU CAN'T BE ME.
IT'S NOT EASY TO BE ME.

30:34.534 --> 30:36.736
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE THIS?

30:36.770 --> 30:37.771
- GOD, I'M SO HUNGRY.

30:37.804 --> 30:38.872
I NEED LUNCH.
I NEED LUNCH.

30:38.905 --> 30:41.074
WHERE'S MY LUNCH?
OLIVIA, OLIVIA.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.676
HELLO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

30:42.709 --> 30:45.412
NO, NO.

30:45.445 --> 30:47.480
JEEZ, I HATE EVERYONE.
THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY.

30:47.514 --> 30:48.715
I'M GONNA HAVE
A PANIC ATTACK.

30:48.748 --> 30:50.817
I'M GONNA DIE.
I HATE FREDRIK.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.952
[sighs]

30:52.986 --> 30:55.622
- THAT IS NOT ME.

30:55.655 --> 30:57.724
THIS IS A REVEALING MOMENT
FOR ME, ACTUALLY.

31:07.701 --> 31:08.668
- OKAY.

31:08.702 --> 31:09.969
YOU ACTUALLY
SMELL PRETTY GOOD.

31:10.070 --> 31:10.970
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

31:11.071 --> 31:13.373
- JUST OLD-SCHOOL
POLO COLOGNE.

31:13.406 --> 31:14.941
- TODD'S TAILORED SUIT
IS NOT READY YET,

31:14.974 --> 31:16.142
BUT I CAN ALREADY SEE

31:16.176 --> 31:17.811
THAT HE'S TAKING MORE PRIDE
IN HIMSELF.

31:17.844 --> 31:19.079
VERY NICE.

31:19.112 --> 31:21.281
BUT TODAY'S ALL ABOUT
CENTRAL PARK WEST.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.249
WE NEED TO GET
THIS LISTING SOLD.

31:23.283 --> 31:25.852
SO TODAY WE'RE COLD-CALLING
PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.588
SO COLD-CALLING,
AS OLD-FASHIONED AS IT SOUNDS,

31:28.621 --> 31:31.858
IT'S THE BIGGEST SOURCE
OF GENERATING LEADS, PERIOD,

31:31.891 --> 31:34.294
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE
COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.596
ALL RIGHT?
- YOU THREW ME OFF GUARD.

31:36.629 --> 31:38.198
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE DOING THIS TODAY.

31:38.231 --> 31:39.733
- THAT'S THE GOOD THING
ABOUT IT.

31:39.766 --> 31:41.334
SO YOU HAVE
TO ADAPT QUICKLY.

31:41.368 --> 31:43.603
SO I PUT TOGETHER A LIST
OF OWNERS

31:43.636 --> 31:44.771
IN THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

31:44.804 --> 31:46.473
INTRODUCE YOURSELF.
TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE.

31:46.506 --> 31:48.942
YOU KNOW, "WE HAVE A LISTING
AT 353 CENTRAL PARK WEST."

31:48.975 --> 31:50.744
VERY SIMPLE.
- OKAY.

31:50.777 --> 31:52.312
- LET'S LOOSEN UP
A LITTLE BIT.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.314
FIRST CALL, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE BIGGEST WHALE.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.383
HE IS A VERY WEALTHY MAN

31:56.416 --> 31:58.184
WHO HAS SEVERAL PROPERTIES
IN THE MARKET.

31:58.218 --> 32:01.688
SO THIS IS SOMEBODY
THAT IS AN ACTUAL INVESTOR.

32:01.721 --> 32:03.456
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

32:03.490 --> 32:05.892
[dial tone]

32:05.925 --> 32:08.161
[line trilling]

32:08.194 --> 32:10.063
LET'S TRY THIS.

32:10.063 --> 32:11.865
- MR. ATKINS.

32:11.898 --> 32:15.802
JOHN ATKINS?
JOHN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

32:15.835 --> 32:17.704
- [whispering]
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

32:17.737 --> 32:18.805
- OH, GOOD, GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

32:18.838 --> 32:21.641
HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR DAY?

32:21.675 --> 32:23.643
- STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.

32:23.677 --> 32:26.713
- WELL, I'M
IN THE REAL-ESTATE INDUSTRY,

32:26.746 --> 32:30.383
AND THE REAL-ESTATE INDUSTRY
IS DOING INCREDIBLY WELL.

32:30.417 --> 32:33.286
PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE
MONEY TOGETHER.

32:36.790 --> 32:40.360
[line clicks, dial tone]

32:40.393 --> 32:41.594
- IT'S GOOD.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.096
THE WORSE YOUR CALLS ARE,

32:43.129 --> 32:45.331
THE MOST YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHAT NOT TO DO.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.733
I'LL CALL THE NEXT ONE.

32:46.766 --> 32:48.201
THIS BUSINESS
IS NOT FOR THE WEAK.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.637
THIS PERSON SAYS NO,
HANG UP, AND GO TO THE NEXT.

32:50.670 --> 32:51.871
IT'S NOT TO TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

32:51.905 --> 32:54.708
MRS. GOODMAN.

32:54.741 --> 32:56.309
THIS IS LUIS ORTIZ
FROM DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.244
THE REASON OF THIS CALL
IS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

32:58.278 --> 33:00.046
353 CENTRAL PARK WEST.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.281
LET ME DO SOMETHING.

33:01.314 --> 33:02.782
LET ME GET
YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.250
AND I'M SURE
THAT ONCE YOU SEE IT,

33:04.284 --> 33:05.952
YOU'LL BE VERY IMPRESSED
WITH OUR NUMBERS,

33:06.052 --> 33:08.455
AND THEN YOU'LL DEFINITELY
CONSIDER WORKING WITH US.

33:09.656 --> 33:12.058
OKAY, IF YOU LOOK EXACTLY
HOW YOU SOUND,

33:12.058 --> 33:13.760
I WILL MARRY YOU TOMORROW.

33:13.793 --> 33:15.895
- [laughs]
- MY PLEASURE.

33:15.929 --> 33:17.797
AND THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.099
- VERY GOOD.
- THAT'S A CALL.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.201
BE VERY PERSONABLE.
LISTEN TO THEM.

33:21.234 --> 33:23.536
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, ROUND TWO.

33:23.570 --> 33:25.739
[dial tone]

33:25.772 --> 33:30.076
- HI, GOOD MORNING.
UH, STEPHANIE?

33:30.076 --> 33:31.811
[stammering]
MY NAME IS TODD,

33:31.845 --> 33:35.081
AND I'M
IN THE REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.417
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TODAY?

33:37.450 --> 33:39.552
HAVE YOU BEEN OUTSIDE
AT ALL TODAY?

33:39.586 --> 33:41.521
- TODD IS NOT GETTING
ANY BETTER WITH PRACTICE.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.289
ACTUALLY, I THINK
HE'S GETTING WORSE.

33:43.323 --> 33:45.158
- YES, UH,
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

33:45.191 --> 33:49.329
MY NAME IS TODD.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

33:49.362 --> 33:50.997
WELL, I'D LIKE TO--
I LIKE--

33:51.097 --> 33:52.265
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD MEET.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.507
- MY TOP PRIORITY
IS TO SELL THIS APARTMENT,

34:00.540 --> 34:02.208
AND THE LAST THING
I NEED IS TO PARTNER UP

34:02.242 --> 34:03.877
WITH SOMEONE
THAT IS GONNA HOLD ME BACK,

34:03.910 --> 34:05.478
SO WE HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

34:15.288 --> 34:17.323
- I'VE BEEN SHOWING
MY SKY-GARAGE LISTING

34:17.357 --> 34:18.491
LIKE CRAZY,

34:18.525 --> 34:20.794
BUT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ONE SINGLE OFFER.

34:20.827 --> 34:22.328
AND TO SPEND
THAT KIND OF MONEY,

34:22.362 --> 34:25.331
I THINK PEOPLE REALLY NEED
TO SEE THE FINISHED PRODUCT.

34:25.365 --> 34:28.768
FOR 23 MILLION BUCKS,
YOU WANT THAT WOW FACTOR.

34:34.641 --> 34:37.877
THIS ISN'T EVEN CLOSE
TO BEING DONE.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.346
THIS ISN'T DONE AT ALL.

34:39.379 --> 34:42.382
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE,
CLOSE TO COMPLETION BY NOW.

34:42.415 --> 34:43.850
- HEY, RYAN.
- YO.

34:43.883 --> 34:45.085
- I'M UP HERE.

34:45.118 --> 34:46.286
- ALL RIGHT.

34:46.319 --> 34:48.855
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
[exhales sharply]

34:48.888 --> 34:50.457
[exhales sharply]

34:50.490 --> 34:51.691
- WHAT'S UP?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:51.725 --> 34:53.927
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.364
- SO THE--YOU KNOW,
THE CONSTRUCTION SITE--

34:57.397 --> 34:59.165
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SLOWER
THAN WE HAD HOPED FOR.

34:59.199 --> 35:02.435
- YEAH, I CAN TELL.
- YEAH, WE'RE DELAYED.

35:02.469 --> 35:05.405
AND I THINK THAT'S
KIND OF WHY I WANTED YOU

35:05.438 --> 35:06.806
TO COME HERE TODAY.

35:06.840 --> 35:10.310
SO, IF YOU WANT, I CAN GIVE YOU
A CONSTRUCTION UPDATE.

35:10.343 --> 35:12.245
THE VAULT IS COMING
FROM CALIFORNIA.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.613
- IN PIECES, RIGHT?
- IN PIECES.

35:13.646 --> 35:14.948
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT.

35:15.048 --> 35:17.550
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL NEVER KNOW
UNTIL IT GETS HERE.

35:17.584 --> 35:19.786
- YEAH.
OKAY.

35:19.819 --> 35:22.122
SO THIS IS
MY NUMBER-ONE CONCERN, THEN--

35:22.155 --> 35:23.923
WHERE CONSTRUCTION
IS RIGHT NOW.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.059
- YEAH, BUT,
YOU KNOW, RYAN,

35:26.059 --> 35:28.828
WE REALLY WANT TO GET BUYERS
IN HERE IN THE INTERIM.

35:28.862 --> 35:32.098
WALKER TOWER SOLD OUT
WITH RECORD, YOU KNOW, PRICES,

35:32.132 --> 35:33.366
YOU KNOW,
PRE-CONSTRUCTION.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.934
- BECAUSE IT'S
A DIFFERENT MARKET.

35:34.968 --> 35:36.369
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
LIKE A CAR,

35:36.403 --> 35:37.971
WALKER TOWER
AND THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS

35:38.071 --> 35:39.372
THAT COME UP,

35:39.406 --> 35:41.541
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT A TOYOTA
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE, RIGHT?

35:41.574 --> 35:42.609
YOU CAN GO
AND BUY A TOYOTA

35:42.642 --> 35:44.244
WITHOUT HAVING
TO ACTUALLY SIT IN IT.

35:44.277 --> 35:47.147
BUT THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.

35:47.180 --> 35:51.217
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE, LIKE,
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE.

35:51.251 --> 35:53.653
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN
A SKY VAULT BEFORE,

35:53.687 --> 35:55.255
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA PAY
WHAT WE WANT

35:55.288 --> 35:57.290
AND PAY THE PREMIUM
UNTIL IT'S DONE.

35:57.323 --> 36:00.493
THEN THEY CAN GET
A BETTER IDEA.

36:00.527 --> 36:03.763
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.
- OKAY.

36:03.797 --> 36:06.299
I MEAN,
I SEE HOW COMPLEX IT IS.

36:06.332 --> 36:09.569
FOR ME, IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO VISUALIZE IT AS WELL.

36:09.602 --> 36:11.471
SO WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MORE WEEKS
OF CONSTRUCTION LEFT.

36:11.504 --> 36:14.040
- SO I'M GONNA START
THE COMMERCIAL ONCE THAT THING

36:14.040 --> 36:16.376
IS COMPLETELY BUILT
AND BEAUTIFUL.

36:16.409 --> 36:17.844
- YEAH.

36:17.877 --> 36:20.513
- THE ENDING FOR MY COMMERCIAL
TAKES PLACE IN THE SKY VAULT,

36:20.547 --> 36:22.415
AND SINCE THE SKY VAULT
ISN'T FINISHED YET,

36:22.449 --> 36:24.317
SINCE THE APARTMENT
ISN'T FINISHED YET,

36:24.351 --> 36:26.052
I'M COMPLETELY [bleep].

36:26.052 --> 36:28.588
AND THE LAST THING I WANT
IS TO BE STALLED

36:28.621 --> 36:31.591
ON A $23 MILLION PROPERTY.

36:41.368 --> 36:44.604
- THE OPEN HOUSE AT THE APTHORP
WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS,

36:44.637 --> 36:46.973
AND I MET A BROKER THERE
WHO'S CALLED ME.

36:47.073 --> 36:48.808
SO I HOPE
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR ME,

36:48.842 --> 36:51.311
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN TAKE ARI.

36:51.344 --> 36:53.079
OH, HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

36:53.079 --> 36:54.848
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL.

36:54.881 --> 36:56.516
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.184
- WHAT A NICE LITTLE PLACE.
- RIGHT?

36:58.218 --> 37:00.553
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WHEN I WALKED IN.

37:00.587 --> 37:02.689
- SO HOW'S EVERYTHING?

37:02.722 --> 37:04.257
- GOOD, GOOD.
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY.

37:04.290 --> 37:08.762
AND THEY REALLY LIKE IT.
- HOW MUCH DO THEY LIKE IT?

37:08.795 --> 37:11.264
- MY BUYER
HAS PROPOSED $8 MILLION.

37:14.434 --> 37:15.769
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

37:15.802 --> 37:20.273
I CAME TO LOWER EAST SIDE
TO GET AN OFFER $1.5 MILLION

37:20.306 --> 37:22.375
BELOW MY $9.5 MILLION ASK?

37:22.409 --> 37:23.543
- THEY LOVE IT.

37:23.576 --> 37:25.445
- WELL, THEY DON'T SEEM
TO LOVE IT.

37:25.478 --> 37:26.446
THEY SEEM TO HATE IT.

37:26.479 --> 37:28.481
- THEY LOVE IT AT $8 MILLION.

37:28.515 --> 37:30.784
- $8 MILLION IS NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, MY FRIEND.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.752
THE OFFER
WILL BE REJECTED.

37:32.786 --> 37:36.623
I HAVE TO CALL MY SELLER
AND GET SCREAMED AT,

37:36.656 --> 37:40.860
HUMILIATED,
PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

37:40.894 --> 37:42.529
- WELL, I'LL BE WAITING HERE
WITH THE WINE.

37:42.562 --> 37:45.065
- THIS IS NOT A PERSON
THAT'S GONNA TAKE THIS LIGHTLY,

37:45.098 --> 37:46.533
YOU UNDERSTAND?

37:46.566 --> 37:48.702
IT'S NOT THE OFFER ITSELF
OF $8 MILLION THAT BOTHERS ME.

37:48.735 --> 37:50.403
IT'S A LOW OFFER,
BUT I CAN HANDLE LOW OFFER.

37:50.437 --> 37:51.905
WHAT SCARES ME,
REALLY SCARES ME,

37:51.938 --> 37:53.640
IS PRESENTING IT.

37:53.673 --> 37:55.909
[line trilling]

37:55.942 --> 37:57.310
- HEY, FREDRIK.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.279
- ARI?
- YES?

37:59.312 --> 38:04.017
- I GOT AN OFFER
FOR THE APTHORP, 2F.

38:04.050 --> 38:07.654
THE OFFER IS $8 MILLION,
ALL CASH.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.236
I HAVE TO.
BY LAW, I HAVE TO CALL--

38:25.038 --> 38:27.040
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.408
9.5 MILLION
IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

38:28.441 --> 38:30.110
I TOLD YOU THAT
IN THE LISTING APPOINTMENT.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.444
I TOLD YOU 9 MILLION.

38:33.046 --> 38:34.080
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:34.114 --> 38:35.582
YOU'RE BEING
AS RIDICULOUS AS HE IS.

38:35.615 --> 38:39.252
LET'S GO--LET'S MEET HIM
AT $9.25 MILLION, $9.25 MILLION.

38:39.285 --> 38:40.920
JUST TRUST ME.
YOU CALLED ME FOR A REASON.

38:40.954 --> 38:43.323
YOU HIRED ME FOR A REASON.
LET ME DO MY JOB.

38:50.196 --> 38:53.433
- LET'S GO--LET'S MEET HIM
AT $9.25 MILLION, $9.25 MILLION.

38:53.466 --> 38:55.068
JUST TRUST ME.
YOU HIRED ME FOR A REASON.

38:55.101 --> 38:56.670
LET ME DO MY JOB.

38:56.703 --> 38:57.971
- [groans]

39:02.175 --> 39:03.476
- [growls]

39:08.248 --> 39:10.617
HE'S REALLY NICE.

39:10.650 --> 39:14.087
SO 8 MILLION IS A NO,
A BIG, BIG NO, NO.

39:14.120 --> 39:18.124
HE'S SAYING TO ME
THAT 9.5 MILLION OR NOTHING.

39:18.158 --> 39:20.226
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
NO.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.328
NO, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO CALL YOUR SIDE.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.697
- NO, I'M NOT CALLING.

39:23.730 --> 39:26.099
HE SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME
NOT TO CALL.

39:26.132 --> 39:27.233
YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME

39:27.267 --> 39:28.768
THAT YOU'VE SEEN A LOT
FOR THIS CLIENT,

39:28.802 --> 39:30.337
AND THEY HAVEN'T
LIKED ANYTHING.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.172
THIS IS THE ONE FOR THEM.

39:32.205 --> 39:33.239
GO TALK TO THEM.

39:33.273 --> 39:35.108
JUST GET THEM UP
SOMEWHERE.

39:37.911 --> 39:40.513
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- I'M WORRIED.

39:40.547 --> 39:42.649
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE THERE'S
SO MUCH ON THE LINE HERE.

39:42.682 --> 39:44.617
I'VE BEEN CHASING ARI
FOR YEARS.

39:44.651 --> 39:46.853
HE HAS A LOT
OF APARTMENTS.

39:46.886 --> 39:48.655
- GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT
MORE ROOM TO WIGGLE WITH.

39:48.688 --> 39:50.490
YOU WILL HAVE
THE DEAL DONE TODAY.

39:50.523 --> 39:53.393
- AND IF I DON'T DO THIS,
IT'S OVER.

39:53.426 --> 39:54.861
- ALL RIGHT.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.062
[sighs]

39:56.062 --> 39:58.198
- SO WE HAVE A DEAL,
$9.5 MILLION?

39:58.231 --> 40:01.868
- NOPE.
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

40:01.901 --> 40:04.170
$8.5 MILLION.
- OH, GOD.

40:04.204 --> 40:06.139
$8.5 MILLION IS RIDICULOUS.

40:06.172 --> 40:07.540
GO BACK,
CALL THEM ONE LAST TIME,

40:07.574 --> 40:09.576
AND GET THE HIGHEST
AND BEST FINAL NUMBER.

40:09.609 --> 40:10.744
- THAT WAS $8.5 MILLION.

40:10.777 --> 40:12.345
- NO, IT WASN'T THE BEST
AND FINAL NUMBER.

40:12.379 --> 40:15.615
I WANT THE BEST AND FINAL,
OR I'M DONE.

40:23.690 --> 40:25.759
- ALL RIGHT.

40:25.792 --> 40:28.962
$8.8 MILLION,
BEST AND FINAL.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.236
- THIS IS IT.

40:36.269 --> 40:39.906
UNFORTUNATELY,
I CAN TELL.

40:39.939 --> 40:42.776
AND IF ARI TURNS THIS DOWN...

40:42.809 --> 40:47.213
[blows raspberry]
I'M FIRED, I GUESS.

40:47.247 --> 40:49.315
[line trilling]

40:51.751 --> 40:54.688
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

40:54.721 --> 40:58.958
OKAY, SO I GOT HIM UP
QUITE A BIT, I HAVE TO SAY.

41:00.493 --> 41:04.664
$8.8 MILLION,
ALL CASH.

41:09.169 --> 41:10.470
ARI?

41:13.173 --> 41:15.675
REALLY?

41:15.709 --> 41:17.944
WAIT.
ACCEPT?

41:20.513 --> 41:21.715
WAH!

41:21.748 --> 41:23.717
IT FEELS SO GOOD,
BECAUSE EVERY DIFFICULT CLIENT,

41:23.750 --> 41:26.219
EVERY DIFFICULT PROPERTY

TO REAL-ESTATE HEAVEN,

41:28.755 --> 41:31.591
AND I'VE JUST TAKEN
A REAL BIG STEP.

41:31.624 --> 41:35.261
CAN WE HAVE THE CHECK, PLEASE?
HE'S PAYING.

41:35.295 --> 41:37.397
I DID IT.

41:37.430 --> 41:38.932
- $8.8 MILLION?
- YOU DID IT.

41:38.965 --> 41:40.333
WE DID IT TOGETHER.
- ALL RIGHT.

41:40.367 --> 41:41.901
- THANK YOU, BUDDY.

41:41.935 --> 41:43.770
- HEY, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

41:43.803 --> 41:44.904
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

41:44.938 --> 41:47.607
- WHEE!

[laughs]

41:57.484 --> 41:58.885
- WAH!

41:58.918 --> 42:00.720
- SHE'S SAD THAT NONE OF YOU
HAVE MADE AN OFFER YET.

42:00.754 --> 42:02.122
- YOU'RE SO HANDSOME.
YOU COULD BE GAY.

42:02.155 --> 42:04.924
- I'M STRAIGHT.
- STRAIGHT TO MY BED.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.893
- WOW.

42:06.926 --> 42:09.062
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

42:09.095 --> 42:11.297
- RIGHT NOW
WE'RE IN A VERY CRAZY MARKET.

42:11.331 --> 42:12.532
IT'S NOT ABOUT
SELLING UNITS.

42:12.565 --> 42:14.567
IT'S ABOUT SELLING THEM
FOR THE TOP DOLLAR.

42:14.601 --> 42:16.536
- $6 MILLION.
- $40 MILLION.

42:16.569 --> 42:17.671

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

42:23.643 --> 42:24.744

I CAN DO THIS.

42:24.778 --> 42:27.747
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

42:27.781 --> 42:29.549
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE HOUSEWIFE.

42:29.582 --> 42:31.184
- WHAT'S SO DIFFICULT
ABOUT THAT?

42:31.217 --> 42:34.287
- THAT IS MY FEAR.
- BASICALLY IT'S OVER.

42:34.320 --> 42:37.223
- WHEN SOMEONE PUTS
$2.5 MILLION IN YOUR HAND,

42:37.257 --> 42:38.825
YOU CLOSE YOUR HAND.

42:38.858 --> 42:41.695
- WHEN YOU PROMISE SOMETHING,
YOU NEED TO DELIVER.

42:41.728 --> 42:43.430
- YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW.
LISTEN TO ME.

42:43.463 --> 42:45.465
- WHERE IS MY ASKING PRICE?
WHERE IS IT?
