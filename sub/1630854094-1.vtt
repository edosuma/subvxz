Thanks for having me at this
amazing artist guesthouse

51:09.065 --> 51:10.317
at Yours and Owls Festival.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.653
My first festival was
a Big Day Out many moons ago.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.782
I was the first in the gate
and I was so excited, obviously.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.075
It's indelibly burned
into my memory.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.411
Hearing songs for the first time

51:24.000 --> 51:24.164
live by bands
I'd never heard before

51:24.664 --> 51:27.542
and I was overcome
by what festivals mean to me

51:27.626 --> 51:29.377
and what they can create
for people.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.339
And so that's where the magic
is, I think, in some ways.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.674
For us, what we can create,

51:36.000 --> 51:37.177
how we can communicate
to people.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.096
My advice is
to the great artists

51:39.179 --> 51:40.889
who are about to perform
right now,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.100
is to, you know, trust
your gut, get weird,

51:44.184 --> 51:46.102
