WEBVTT

00:57.019 --> 00:58.124
Hey there.

01:00.726 --> 01:02.051
Hey, Mackenzie.

01:11.296 --> 01:12.402
Hi, baby.

01:20.076 --> 01:21.774
You're really fast.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.284
I think we got
a future athlete on our hands.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.616
Good throw.

01:46.938 --> 01:47.998
Kick it right at me.

01:50.774 --> 01:51.804
Almost.

01:54.943 --> 01:56.407
Here.

01:56.442 --> 01:58.217
Okay, watch the tree.

01:59.512 --> 02:01.286
Come over the top or underneath.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.995
Wow!
Look at that dynamic duo!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.836
Lucas has cooties.

02:21.871 --> 02:22.967
Do not.

02:25.703 --> 02:27.246
We don't say that, Mac.

02:27.978 --> 02:29.215
Apologize now.

02:30.649 --> 02:31.679
Mac.

02:39.187 --> 02:40.853
It's so good!

02:44.857 --> 02:46.694
What are you doing
there, Big Mac?

02:47.296 --> 02:49.194
We're learning how to tell time.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.629
Daddy, look
what Mackenzie did!

02:51.665 --> 02:53.696
Oh, yeah,
it's pretty good.

02:53.731 --> 02:55.505
Oh, come on! Give me a break!

03:00.407 --> 03:01.943
Hey! Watch it!

03:01.978 --> 03:03.007
Sorry, mom.

03:04.549 --> 03:06.875
Are you nervous
about the championship game?

03:06.911 --> 03:09.812
-Yes.
-A little bit. Not really.

03:09.848 --> 03:11.690
-What?
-You've thought about it.

03:11.726 --> 03:12.852
No, you're nervous.

03:13.418 --> 03:14.524
I got it.

03:19.691 --> 03:21.060
What's up, Schaffer?

03:21.429 --> 03:23.236
You know, just hanging in there.

03:24.368 --> 03:26.203
-Stop doing that!
-What?

03:26.238 --> 03:28.036
I know you're zooming in
on my face.

03:28.072 --> 03:29.199
No, I'm not.

03:29.868 --> 03:31.467
Do you think I'm pretty
or something?

03:31.503 --> 03:32.542
Ew! No.

03:33.573 --> 03:35.078
Stop recording and kick with me.

03:35.447 --> 03:37.382
Coach thinks I need to work
on my foot skills.

03:38.015 --> 03:39.076
Sure.

03:39.843 --> 03:41.914
Mac, it's time to go.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.984
My dad's moving out today,
so, see you tomorrow?

03:46.520 --> 03:47.986
Uh, yeah, for sure.

03:55.766 --> 03:58.603
-So welcome
to my crib.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.335
I got to repaint the walls
now since I'm older

04:01.370 --> 04:02.638
and don't like the color pink.

04:04.235 --> 04:07.170
Here are my trophies
back to when I was like five.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.976
Oh, and here is a stack
of books. I read a lot.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.287
Oh, and here's some books
I haven't read.

04:16.318 --> 04:17.950
Here's some medals.

04:19.221 --> 04:20.785
Oh, and my art.

04:21.254 --> 04:24.022
I keep it in my closet
because my mom thinks
it's weird.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.229
Mackenzie missed again.

04:28.264 --> 04:29.368
Up and back. Let's go!

04:30.833 --> 04:33.537
No one's going home
until Mackenzie makes a goal.

04:34.770 --> 04:37.508
Come on chicken shits!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

04:50.919 --> 04:53.224
Now that Mackenzie's shown us
she actually deserves

04:53.260 --> 04:54.855
to be on this team
we can all go home.

04:55.357 --> 04:56.494
All right good practice.

05:01.264 --> 05:02.291
Give me the camera.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.469
What?

05:04.504 --> 05:06.105
We can't have footage
of our practice get out there,

05:06.140 --> 05:07.764
what if the other teams
get ahold of it?

05:07.799 --> 05:09.073
they'll know our every move.

05:09.108 --> 05:10.934
No, really, it's just for me,

05:10.969 --> 05:12.477
so I can get better
at penalties.

05:13.341 --> 05:14.607
Just give a crap

05:14.643 --> 05:16.173
and you'll get better,
Mackenzie.

05:22.516 --> 05:23.679
There you go.

05:23.714 --> 05:24.819
Get it Mackenzie.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.988
Oh, shit.

05:33.996 --> 05:36.666
Hey, Mac. Your dad
wants me to take a video of you.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.468
You told him?

05:38.503 --> 05:40.839
I had to,
you're on his insurance.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.199
Like he even cares.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.702
No, don't stop.

05:45.171 --> 05:48.174
If we're gonna send out a video,
let's send him a video.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.982
Hey, dad, hope you're enjoying
your new life

05:51.018 --> 05:52.451
with your new girlfriend.

05:52.486 --> 05:56.614
I tore my ACL, so I'll be out
for a year at least.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.954
So that fucking sucks.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.048
Mac.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.788
What? It's the truth,
this sucks,

06:01.823 --> 06:03.794
dad sucks, don't act like it
doesn't suck.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.564
You know what?
I'm not sending this.

06:08.061 --> 06:11.001
Hey, Big Mac,
what day is it today?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.070
Don't call me that.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.640
It's the first day
of high school, Miss Schaffer.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.305
Why are you taking a video?

06:16.340 --> 06:17.906
Shouldn't we take a picture?

06:17.941 --> 06:20.237
I like video we used
to take video all the time.

06:21.046 --> 06:22.074
Okay, Spielberg.

06:23.284 --> 06:24.979
You can't outrun me,
you know.

06:25.015 --> 06:26.317
Mom!

06:26.352 --> 06:27.915
Hey, everyone.
So you might have seen

06:27.951 --> 06:30.379
another thing going around
called "cinnamon challenge"

06:30.414 --> 06:32.524
and me and my friend here are
gonna give it a whirl.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.426
This is Mackenzie and she had
surgery to fix her ACL.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.754
But don't worry,
they gave me the good stuff.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.066
Okay, so we have some cinnamon,
two spoons,

06:41.101 --> 06:42.633
some water bottles and a bowl.

06:43.462 --> 06:44.765
A bowl?

06:44.801 --> 06:47.132
Sometimes people have
to like spit back up.

06:47.799 --> 06:49.274
This is gonna be awful.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.171
We have to do at the same time,
okay?

06:51.206 --> 06:52.610
Okay.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.403
Alright, when I say go.
I'll count down from three.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.110
I'm kind of freaked out.

06:56.479 --> 06:59.914
Me too. Three, two, one, go.

07:08.258 --> 07:09.626
Hello, Lucas.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.956
So, uh, you're probably
really confused to see me

07:12.425 --> 07:15.329
and you're probably thinking,
"When did Mac get my camera?"

07:15.899 --> 07:17.963
Well it was when you were
in Walmart getting stuff

07:17.998 --> 07:20.330
for a science project
because, you know,

07:21.935 --> 07:23.975
so, yeah,
I'm pretty sneaky I guess.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.677
Why do you always keep
this thing with you anyway?

07:27.608 --> 07:29.141
I'm always watching.

07:36.848 --> 07:37.985
Oh, shit, you're coming.

07:42.192 --> 07:43.594
Hey, guys.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.222
So I've been really getting
into makeup recently

07:45.258 --> 07:47.596
and I've been mainly watching
by YouTube videos,

07:47.631 --> 07:49.331
so, I thought I'd make
one of my own

07:49.367 --> 07:51.168
to maybe help some people.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.163
This is what I'm gonna call
my new everyday look.

07:54.198 --> 07:56.067
I'm gonna do two steps,
one at home

07:56.102 --> 07:58.770
and one at school
because my mom hates it.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.441
But, you can do it all in one.

08:00.477 --> 08:01.679
Like and subscribe below!

08:09.486 --> 08:10.856
How's that knee feel?

08:10.892 --> 08:11.922
Like brand new.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.189
Ready to play
next season?

08:14.225 --> 08:15.622
I don't know.

08:15.657 --> 08:16.886
How can you not know?

08:17.322 --> 08:19.224
Don't you have like
a countdown in your room?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.226
My doctor's worried about it.

08:21.894 --> 08:23.327
About re-tearing it?

08:23.362 --> 08:25.395
You can wear a brace?
Get it all strong and stuff.

08:27.537 --> 08:29.271
Not that knee, the other one.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.874
He's worried about me
tearing that one too.

08:32.641 --> 08:33.909
I have bad knees or something.

08:34.509 --> 08:35.838
Wait, Mac.

08:35.874 --> 08:36.912
What are you saying?

08:37.814 --> 08:40.212
I guess soccer isn't my thing
after all.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.116
Lucas.

08:43.984 --> 08:46.251
See, Mackenzie,
that was easy.

08:47.018 --> 08:48.317
I'm a good driver, mom.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.219
I know you are
but this is just in case

08:50.254 --> 08:52.120
you're in an accident
for evidence.

08:52.523 --> 08:55.364
You know your cousin Shannon
could have sued that guy

08:55.399 --> 08:56.525
if she had a dash cam.

08:57.729 --> 08:58.769
Whatever.

Lucas Parker, over here!
Lucas Parker!

09:42.207 --> 09:44.782
So, you had quite the game
today.

09:45.779 --> 09:47.012
A goal and an assist!

09:47.047 --> 09:48.454
What do you have to say
about that?

09:48.489 --> 09:50.786
Oh, team played really great,
you know,

09:50.822 --> 09:53.153
we work together
and that kind of stuff happens.

09:54.254 --> 09:56.558
Uh, but, I mean,
like that's two goals

09:56.593 --> 09:57.920
because of you, screw the team.

09:58.589 --> 10:01.027
-Yeah.
-You just won
the state championship.

10:01.062 --> 10:02.668
What are you,
what are you gonna do now?

10:04.402 --> 10:05.528
I'm gonna ask Katie out.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.603
Oh, oh.

10:09.139 --> 10:13.646
Uh, gotta kick some balls
to get some balls. I guess.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.596
-I did it!
-Yeah!

10:32.631 --> 10:34.233
Lucas Parker,
delete that right now!

10:34.268 --> 10:35.594
-No!
-Delete it!

10:35.630 --> 10:37.065
Or what?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.931
I will stop this car
and you can get your ride home.

10:39.966 --> 10:41.333
I've heard that before.

10:42.803 --> 10:44.102
Why are you so close?

10:44.137 --> 10:45.768
-I gotta... Okay, go.
-Okay.

10:45.804 --> 10:46.844
Go for it.

10:49.150 --> 10:50.639
Yeah, there you go.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.344
I did it.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.415
What are you looking at?

10:56.817 --> 10:58.350
I'm just looking at you.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.522
Hey, I'm back. Here you go.

11:02.558 --> 11:03.587
Thanks.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.523
-Wanna take a picture?
-Yeah, go for it.

11:07.462 --> 11:08.492
Mm-hmm.

11:09.327 --> 11:10.962
-Vogue! Vogue! Vogue!
-Is it cute?

11:10.997 --> 11:12.137
-Yes.
-Let me see.

11:35.659 --> 11:36.960
Go ahead! Open it.

11:38.392 --> 11:40.657
Sure you're gonna want
this video if I don't get in?

11:40.692 --> 11:43.562
Rejection letters
do not come in big envelopes.

11:43.597 --> 11:44.627
Open it!

11:45.536 --> 11:47.630
Okay, fine, whatever.

11:57.714 --> 11:58.883
What does it say?

12:01.519 --> 12:02.547
I'm on the waitlist.

12:03.583 --> 12:07.926
Oh, honey, that's okay,
that's still really good.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.762
So much for big envelopes.

12:11.195 --> 12:13.657
-Hey, mom,
could you stop please.
-Oh, yeah.

12:13.693 --> 12:17.495
Pearson high school's
own Lucas Parker signed today.

12:17.530 --> 12:20.563
He will attend Northern Indiana
University next fall.

12:20.598 --> 12:23.208
Parker has been Pearson's
shining star athlete

12:23.243 --> 12:26.812
for the last two years
and was heavily recruited
during his final season.

12:28.244 --> 12:31.817
It'd be better from this angle,
if I can catch this.

12:32.286 --> 12:34.085
Okay, are you ready.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.552
-You sure you don't want me
to hold--
-No, no, I've got it.

12:36.587 --> 12:40.958
Okay, one, two, three.

12:43.254 --> 12:44.423
I caught it again.

12:45.456 --> 12:47.462
It's okay, here,
try one more time.

12:47.498 --> 12:48.526
-Go.
-Three!

12:51.434 --> 12:52.464
Three!

12:54.104 --> 12:55.898
-Dang!
-Are you scared
of it or...?

12:55.934 --> 12:56.974
No! Three!

12:58.645 --> 13:01.641
-I give up.
-Oh! That catch!

13:10.515 --> 13:12.251
Mackenzie,
what are you doing?

13:12.287 --> 13:14.189
-I'm dancing!
-Yeah, I can see that.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.456
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

13:18.758 --> 13:19.788
Wow!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.558
Come on, come on!

13:22.593 --> 13:24.633
I think this party is going
to be so great.

13:24.668 --> 13:25.832
-Uh-huh.
-Wait a minute.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.664
-Uh-huh.
-We're here.

13:32.676 --> 13:34.068
This way, this way!

13:43.519 --> 13:45.022
Hey, um,

13:47.061 --> 13:51.690
so Mr. Henries had
our graduating class
do a time capsule,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.261
but, I didn't put anything
in there

13:54.297 --> 13:56.361
because I didn't want
any kindergartner in 2030,

13:56.396 --> 13:58.365
whatever,
digging through any of my crap.

14:00.030 --> 14:01.104
But, um,

14:02.573 --> 14:06.010
it was a good idea I guess,
so, I figured I'd make one
for myself.

14:07.006 --> 14:08.342
Just for fun.

14:10.043 --> 14:12.050
Um, so I just graduated.

14:12.086 --> 14:13.116
Yay!

14:14.554 --> 14:15.954
This summer was pretty cool too.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.124
Lucas, Lucas is great,

14:23.829 --> 14:25.425
he's pretty busy all the time,
though.

14:27.264 --> 14:30.293
He's always at practice
or working out or something.

14:30.862 --> 14:33.103
I think he's worried
he's not going to be
good enough,

14:33.672 --> 14:35.732
but I'm not worried at all.

14:38.736 --> 14:40.903
I'm not really excited
about going to college.

14:42.039 --> 14:46.680
Lucas is going to Indiana
and I'm going to be here
in Missouri,

14:46.716 --> 14:49.251
so, that sucks.

14:50.788 --> 14:51.917
Katie's going to Georgia,

14:52.553 --> 14:54.719
they're going to try
the whole long distance thing,

14:54.754 --> 14:58.260
which I think is
a terrible idea, but,
he loves her, so.

15:07.598 --> 15:09.304
Sometimes, when I think
about it I'm...

15:11.373 --> 15:13.737
I just, I don't really
want to go to college.

15:16.275 --> 15:17.840
It just freaks me out because...

15:19.247 --> 15:21.283
I don't really know
who I am or

15:22.147 --> 15:23.186
what I want to do

15:24.918 --> 15:26.354
and I think,

15:26.389 --> 15:28.158
I think the classes might be
really hard because I...

15:29.955 --> 15:33.658
really didn't study the way
that I should have
in high school,

15:36.935 --> 15:38.663
but, but it is what it is now,
right?

15:39.602 --> 15:40.632
So...

15:42.306 --> 15:45.175
I mean, I mean, we don't know
what's gonna happen,

15:45.740 --> 15:46.770
but, um,

15:47.943 --> 15:49.212
we'll find out soon.

16:48.673 --> 16:50.970
Ugh! Come on.

16:53.207 --> 16:56.879
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

16:56.914 --> 17:00.049
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

17:00.084 --> 17:03.886
<i>♪ Happy birthday</i>
<i>dear Mackenzie ♪</i>

17:03.921 --> 17:06.619
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

17:08.858 --> 17:09.886
Mac?

17:11.595 --> 17:12.625
Baby?

17:13.864 --> 17:16.794
Mackenzie, Mackenzie!

17:17.329 --> 17:18.565
Mackenzie, wake up!

17:19.065 --> 17:20.132
Oh, my God!

17:20.167 --> 17:21.537
What is wrong with you?

17:26.613 --> 17:27.873
Did you take these?

17:28.912 --> 17:30.238
Mac, did you take these?

17:32.278 --> 17:33.811
Why did you take Oxies?

17:36.282 --> 17:37.419
I'm sleeping.

17:38.218 --> 17:39.357
Where did you get these?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.491
Mackenzie!

17:42.127 --> 17:43.887
Did you take both these
at the same time?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.555
Oh, my God!

17:46.590 --> 17:48.595
Babe, why would you do that?

17:49.230 --> 17:50.768
Oh, my God! Where's my phone?

17:50.803 --> 17:51.961
Where the hell is my phone?

17:52.471 --> 17:53.502
Shit!

17:53.905 --> 17:55.767
Happy birthday, Mackenzie.

17:57.740 --> 18:01.003
I wanna make this video
because I wanted you
to have something

18:01.038 --> 18:03.046
right when you woke up
the minute that you woke up,

18:03.081 --> 18:05.117
but I also wanted
to show you this.

18:06.749 --> 18:08.010
Ta-da!

18:08.545 --> 18:10.713
Ta-da! Check this out.

18:10.748 --> 18:12.421
Yeah, the team helped me
bring that in.

18:12.954 --> 18:13.983
It's heavy.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.463
What.

18:18.499 --> 18:19.531
What is that?

18:20.100 --> 18:23.927
Is that Mackenzie original
hanging on my wall?

18:25.298 --> 18:27.806
Damn! Look at that!

18:28.175 --> 18:30.505
See? I'm gonna see that
every single day. Thank you.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.303
Anyways I just want
to wish you a happy birthday.

18:36.173 --> 18:38.315
I hope you had a good night,
hope you have a good day.

18:39.779 --> 18:42.319
Yeah I'm gonna call you later.
Love you lots.

18:44.182 --> 18:45.289
Bye!

18:47.027 --> 18:48.893
Come on!
Give a tour for grandma.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.363
Oh, I mean there's not really
much to tour, but, okay.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.595
This is Jenna's side,
my roommate.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.368
I met her earlier,
she seems pretty cool.

19:00.134 --> 19:01.498
This is my side,

19:01.934 --> 19:05.171
we got this comforter
at Bed Bath & Beyond on sale

19:05.206 --> 19:06.673
which I'm very proud of.

19:08.175 --> 19:09.709
Oh, my pictures.

19:10.478 --> 19:12.614
I... I don't know
if I like them.

19:12.649 --> 19:16.485
I tried to make collage but
I don't think it worked well,

19:17.780 --> 19:19.818
but, uh, here's my desk and...

19:20.618 --> 19:21.927
No, don't do that.

19:21.962 --> 19:23.794
Keep it there
so you don't forget.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.988
But grandma doesn't know.

19:26.524 --> 19:28.700
Uh, Hey, Jenna.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.031
What are you watching?

19:30.066 --> 19:32.831
No! You're gonna laugh.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.362
What? Why?

19:34.998 --> 19:37.108
Because you watch scary
stuff all the time.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.870
Just tell me
what you're watching.

19:40.404 --> 19:41.708
Doctor Who.

19:43.644 --> 19:45.346
Okay, oh, my God!
Stop, it's scary okay.

19:45.382 --> 19:48.148
You don't... Wow!
Shit, what the heck?

19:48.183 --> 19:49.448
Why is it scary?

19:49.484 --> 19:52.123
Just stop videoing me,
Mackenzie.

19:52.159 --> 19:54.325
-It's really not that bad.
-You're so rude.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.090
-Oh, are you gonna cry?
-This is bad. Okay, bye.

19:58.227 --> 20:02.267
Okay, so, just answer
the questions as naturally
as you can, thank you.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.192
Well, like, right now?

20:04.227 --> 20:06.037
Well, yes right now,
it's due in ten minutes.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.836
-Jenna, what are you...?
-What?

20:07.871 --> 20:09.240
Okay, fine.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.872
Well, I'd like to finish
my sandwich, but let's go.

20:10.908 --> 20:12.542
Sorry.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.411
Okay, what's your first
impression to people
who meet you?

20:15.779 --> 20:17.577
Um...

20:17.612 --> 20:19.746
I think people think
I'm pretty standoffish,

20:19.781 --> 20:22.248
but I don't think that's totally
accurate of me, um...

20:22.283 --> 20:23.314
That's funny.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.324
-I just look really tired
sometimes.
-Right.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.118
But, I think people think
I'm nice enough.

20:30.629 --> 20:34.160
Okay. What sort
of first impression
do you desire?

20:34.195 --> 20:36.092
Desire.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.835
With that I'm, hello, hi...

20:40.871 --> 20:43.570
I just had to get
your sandwich and your outfit,
sorry.

20:43.606 --> 20:45.637
-Yeah, you said desire, um...
-Yes.

20:46.239 --> 20:49.780
That I'm confident,
I'd really like people to think
I'm confident

20:50.249 --> 20:53.241
and that I'm a good friend
and that I care.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.449
Hey Lucas, um,

20:59.152 --> 21:03.025
I know you're sleeping
because I called you
like three times

21:03.060 --> 21:04.120
and you usually answer.

21:06.495 --> 21:08.397
Your voicemail box
isn't set up yet

21:08.432 --> 21:12.427
so I decided I just make
this little video.

21:12.462 --> 21:14.066
Sorry.

21:14.101 --> 21:15.307
Um...

21:16.743 --> 21:17.837
I can't sleep.

21:18.571 --> 21:22.373
I had a macchiato at eight

21:22.943 --> 21:25.350
and didn't realize
it would still be in my system.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.321
So...

21:31.450 --> 21:32.489
I don't know,

21:33.784 --> 21:35.052
just want to talk to you,

21:38.631 --> 21:39.661
yeah.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.400
It's hard sometimes.

21:43.334 --> 21:45.337
Everything's fine,
but it's just,

21:46.367 --> 21:47.669
it's hard sometimes.

21:49.538 --> 21:51.302
-And go!

21:51.338 --> 21:53.345
Yeah, go team!

21:55.478 --> 21:57.077
What are you on
right now?

21:57.112 --> 21:58.174
The bumper.

21:59.845 --> 22:01.682
Yo!
Look, she's out of it.

22:01.717 --> 22:03.850
Dude.
What do you think she took?

22:03.885 --> 22:06.182
I can't even tell you,
she's leaving right now.

22:06.683 --> 22:07.984
Check me out, bro.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.487
Oh, don't touch her,
that's fucked up.

22:09.522 --> 22:10.593
Watch bro, look.

22:11.324 --> 22:12.364
Boom, bro!

22:12.798 --> 22:13.827
Oxies, man.

22:14.629 --> 22:16.758
This girl is on Venus
right now, man.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.095
-Shit.
-That's crazy.

22:22.032 --> 22:24.599
Guys, it is- 30
in the afternoon.

22:25.335 --> 22:28.473
My roommate is the heaviest
sleeper I've ever met.

22:28.508 --> 22:29.546
This is unacceptable.

22:30.577 --> 22:31.845
So, I'm gonna try something.

22:33.213 --> 22:34.342
Watch.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.658
Hey, girl!

22:50.694 --> 22:52.198
What? I'm sorry.

22:52.234 --> 22:54.136
Ah! You bitch!

22:54.172 --> 22:56.167
Sorry, no, I'm not sorry.

22:56.202 --> 22:58.407
Well, we did what we came here
to do, which is play hard,

22:58.442 --> 22:59.735
take advantage
of every opportunity

22:59.771 --> 23:01.072
the opposing team gave us

23:01.107 --> 23:03.171
and, uh, for that, you know,
I'm proud of our team

23:03.206 --> 23:05.146
and everything we accomplished
here today.

23:05.181 --> 23:08.178
Parker, how did it
feel competing in your first
tournament?

23:08.213 --> 23:10.313
Well, I mean, this is
the first one with these boys

23:10.348 --> 23:12.848
and, I don't know how it could
have felt better or worse

23:12.883 --> 23:14.722
but now we got a title to defend

23:14.757 --> 23:17.154
and I don't think any of us
take that lightly.

23:18.393 --> 23:19.959
Thank you, thank you.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.963
Do you like
the decorations?

23:25.566 --> 23:28.132
Um, yeah, they're just...

23:29.776 --> 23:31.334
Oh, my gosh!

23:31.369 --> 23:34.377
What! When did you get here?
You said you were in Vegas!

23:34.412 --> 23:36.280
I know, I know,
I squeezed in a day.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.615
-Mom, you knew?
-Surprise!

23:39.911 --> 23:41.178
-Yeah. Ready.
-Okay.

23:44.255 --> 23:46.315
Oh, no, that's not what...

23:47.656 --> 23:49.226
Hey, Mac,
you're bleeding.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.725
-Hmm?
-You're bleeding.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.621
Oh, I just must have busted
a scab, it's fine.

23:52.656 --> 23:55.632
-Is that fresh? You said
you were getting better.
-I am, stop.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.540
So, I haven't really done
this in a while,

24:06.944 --> 24:07.974
but, um,

24:10.107 --> 24:11.978
it's been really hard
being back home.

24:15.014 --> 24:16.983
Even harder
than I thought it would be.

24:21.327 --> 24:24.991
Even see my friend Lucas
was hard,

24:28.033 --> 24:29.061
because he's...

24:33.171 --> 24:34.198
he's living the dream.

24:38.502 --> 24:41.040
He's always done everything
right and I'm just like this...

24:42.806 --> 24:43.845
major fuck up

24:45.479 --> 24:46.518
and I don't...

24:48.110 --> 24:49.345
I don't want to be like this,

24:52.686 --> 24:54.251
but every day it's just, uh...

24:59.165 --> 25:01.294
It's really hard...

25:01.330 --> 25:02.699
hard to wake up.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.197
It's hard to go to sleep.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.976
And I want to be happy
because everybody else is happy

25:13.011 --> 25:14.040
but I can't.

25:16.674 --> 25:17.747
I can't...

25:19.484 --> 25:20.952
Kenzie,
you have read receipts on.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.884
Hey, I know you're getting
my texts.

25:24.013 --> 25:25.513
I'm worried about you,

25:25.549 --> 25:27.790
I don't know if you're being
serious, if you're joking,

25:28.860 --> 25:31.054
but you're starting to scare
the shit out of me, okay?

25:31.089 --> 25:32.821
So just please tell me
what's going on.

25:34.726 --> 25:35.798
This isn't you.

25:39.366 --> 25:40.396
So...

25:41.504 --> 25:43.267
Lucas and I just got in this

25:44.505 --> 25:45.973
fucking huge fight

25:47.910 --> 25:49.906
and I don't have anyone to talk
about it with

25:49.941 --> 25:51.583
because I don't have any friends

25:53.881 --> 25:55.785
and I didn't realize that
until now.

25:59.549 --> 26:03.227
He was just like begging me
to call him so I did

26:03.262 --> 26:04.486
and then he just kept saying,

26:06.226 --> 26:08.826
"This isn't you
and you're acting weird
and stuff"

26:08.861 --> 26:10.327
but he just doesn't get it.

26:14.238 --> 26:15.497
This is who I am.

26:17.906 --> 26:20.772
I'm the emotional fuck-up
that is flunking

26:20.807 --> 26:22.977
her first semester in college

26:24.377 --> 26:28.653
and I don't have any friends
because I'm a bad person.

26:30.553 --> 26:32.580
I'm not a good friend I...

26:35.161 --> 26:36.287
he just doesn't get it.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.290
He doesn't know

26:40.830 --> 26:42.997
the things that I thought,
he doesn't know.

26:48.471 --> 26:50.136
He just doesn't know

26:51.001 --> 26:53.205
how hard I'm trying

26:54.775 --> 26:56.648
not to be just a fuck up.

27:02.484 --> 27:03.787
He doesn't get it.

27:08.018 --> 27:09.617
God, I look pathetic.

27:32.348 --> 27:33.377
What's that?

27:53.506 --> 27:56.633
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

27:59.202 --> 28:01.339
Everyday it's just really awful.

28:04.983 --> 28:08.412
And I'm just really tired
feeling this bad all the time.

28:12.587 --> 28:14.484
It hurts so much

28:14.519 --> 28:17.729
and nothing anybody says helps,
nothing I do helps.

28:22.361 --> 28:24.466
It's just like there's
this hole in my chest

28:24.501 --> 28:26.870
and it won't go away.

28:33.042 --> 28:35.346
So, I just don't think
it's worth it anymore,

28:35.381 --> 28:37.414
because I don't have a future

28:38.083 --> 28:42.215
and I'm just like
this big burden on everybody
that I love

28:44.691 --> 28:47.088
and I know they're getting sick
of me because...

28:47.688 --> 28:49.321
I keep fucking up.

28:53.056 --> 28:54.293
But I'm trying.

28:56.764 --> 28:58.462
I'm trying so hard,

29:00.235 --> 29:04.776
but every day is just like
my own personal hell.

29:10.581 --> 29:13.917
So mommy I'm... I'm so sorry.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.351
I'm sorry, mommy.

29:21.086 --> 29:23.692
I love you and I'm so sorry,

29:23.728 --> 29:25.619
you've always been
so good to me

29:25.655 --> 29:28.398
even when I was being a bitch,
I'm sorry mommy.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.802
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:34.998 --> 29:36.203
And Lucas,

29:39.144 --> 29:42.473
thank you for being my friend
even when I didn't deserve it.

29:44.312 --> 29:46.983
And I know you're gonna be
an amazing soccer player.

29:49.112 --> 29:50.214
I'm already...

29:50.249 --> 29:52.351
I'm already so proud
of you, okay?

29:55.189 --> 29:58.755
I don't think I can do this
anymore...

30:05.636 --> 30:08.070
God, I wish I wasn't doing this.

30:13.346 --> 30:15.044
But I've already...

30:16.045 --> 30:20.049
I've already taken
a lot of these, so...

30:21.144 --> 30:22.480
I'm so sorry.

30:31.792 --> 30:33.693
Are you ready?

30:33.729 --> 30:35.328
Yep, I am.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.186
Hey, Mac.

30:59.890 --> 31:01.622
I'm making this video
so that you, uh,

31:02.191 --> 31:04.093
you know you have something
when you wake up.

31:07.665 --> 31:08.933
They won't let me be here.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.232
I tried.

31:14.198 --> 31:15.401
You're asleep right now.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.639
You know, uh, when your mom
called me

31:23.615 --> 31:24.773
and told me what happened

31:25.509 --> 31:27.215
the first thing
that I thought about

31:28.014 --> 31:29.316
was when we were kids

31:29.852 --> 31:31.384
and we'd watch Scooby-Doo

31:32.352 --> 31:36.389
over and over and over again
on repeat.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.428
And then we started dressing up
like them to watch it.

31:40.464 --> 31:41.724
Remember?

31:42.458 --> 31:43.926
And you were always Daphne.

31:44.429 --> 31:48.302
I was always Scooby,
and we'd just...

32:00.916 --> 32:02.580
I care about you so much, Mac.

32:06.457 --> 32:07.519
We all do.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.822
You're like, you're like
this amazing light in our life.

32:16.062 --> 32:17.133
You know, and the...

32:19.428 --> 32:21.269
the idea of that light

32:23.640 --> 32:24.767
just going out.

32:43.687 --> 32:46.822
Mac, there's nothing
that you can ever do

32:47.857 --> 32:50.892
that'll ever change the way
I feel about you.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.206
I will always love you anyway,

33:00.004 --> 33:01.045
always.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.185
I'm gonna record
again.

33:10.314 --> 33:11.517
Is that still okay?

33:14.723 --> 33:15.818
Yeah, sure.

33:28.635 --> 33:30.833
How are you feeling
today, Mackenzie?

33:33.675 --> 33:34.707
Um.

33:35.343 --> 33:37.840
The withdraw is over,
so, better I guess.

33:45.348 --> 33:46.552
I haven't been...

33:49.321 --> 33:52.558
totally sober in a while.

33:55.428 --> 33:57.195
I usually have a beer
or something

33:57.230 --> 33:58.762
to take the edge off, you know.

34:03.236 --> 34:04.570
How does it feel?

34:07.271 --> 34:08.574
Not so great.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.250
I just...

34:16.546 --> 34:17.748
have a lot to think about.

34:22.752 --> 34:24.260
Must be
frightening.

34:30.468 --> 34:31.567
Um...

34:31.902 --> 34:33.335
I just keep thinking about...

34:35.101 --> 34:36.173
my mom's face

34:38.401 --> 34:39.440
when she found me.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.412
It's blurry
but I still remember.

34:48.379 --> 34:49.681
She was really scared.

34:53.820 --> 34:56.754
I didn't want her to be scared,
I just wanted it to be over.

34:58.663 --> 34:59.691
It?

35:04.568 --> 35:05.598
No...

35:07.398 --> 35:08.700
the way I was feeling.

35:10.666 --> 35:12.209
I just wanted it to stop.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.007
I guess that's why I took
the oxies in the first place
and it worked.

35:21.610 --> 35:22.681
It worked,

35:24.416 --> 35:26.454
but then it stopped working.

35:32.124 --> 35:35.331
Yeah, and...

35:38.297 --> 35:39.469
I don't know, I guess...

35:40.139 --> 35:42.668
life just seemed
pretty impossible without it.

35:48.713 --> 35:49.741
Hey, sweetie.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.844
I just got back
from grandma's funeral.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.583
It was nice.

35:57.821 --> 35:59.520
Simple, I guess.

36:01.651 --> 36:03.392
A lot of people asked about you,

36:04.654 --> 36:06.190
asked how you were doing,

36:06.559 --> 36:08.892
so, I told them
you were doing better

36:10.165 --> 36:11.830
but that seemed to confuse them,

36:12.365 --> 36:15.371
so, I started trying to explain

36:16.666 --> 36:18.198
and then I started crying

36:19.034 --> 36:21.938
and they backed off,
which was nice, I guess.

36:25.578 --> 36:28.811
You know, I didn't understand
at first

36:28.846 --> 36:31.552
why you chose not to come
with me today,

36:34.088 --> 36:35.292
because I really,

36:38.023 --> 36:40.561
I really needed you there
with me more than anything.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.269
But when I saw the casket

36:48.263 --> 36:51.902
it just reminded me how close
I was to losing you too.

36:57.540 --> 36:58.744
But, you, my girl,

37:00.279 --> 37:01.615
you are a fighter.

37:03.418 --> 37:06.653
You are so strong
and so beautiful.

37:09.224 --> 37:11.261
And I know you might think

37:11.297 --> 37:14.596
this whole thing has just made
you weak or ugly,

37:14.932 --> 37:16.498
but that is so not true.

37:17.099 --> 37:18.467
You have to believe me.

37:21.304 --> 37:23.274
My mother wasn't always
there for me,

37:24.571 --> 37:26.937
but I am always gonna be there
for you

37:28.375 --> 37:30.105
and don't you forget that, Mac.

37:31.309 --> 37:32.349
Not ever.

37:35.144 --> 37:38.713
Um, so, I don't have phone
privileges in here.

37:38.748 --> 37:42.656
So, Rhonda is helping me film.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.922
Um...

37:46.931 --> 37:50.301
I have depression and...

37:51.628 --> 37:54.102
I got addicted to drugs

37:54.505 --> 37:59.310
when I started using them
to manage my emotions.

38:02.137 --> 38:04.079
But, I've been in rehab
for two months now

38:04.114 --> 38:05.877
and I'm working through it.

38:08.783 --> 38:12.488
When I was a kid I used
to play guitar all the time.

38:14.754 --> 38:18.219
And at my lowest point
I sold it for drugs.

38:20.762 --> 38:24.368
But I wrote a song
and I'd like you guys to hear it

38:25.167 --> 38:26.194
and I hope it helps.

38:35.638 --> 38:38.746

Happy birthday, Lucas.

39:41.272 --> 39:43.744
I get to call you later, but,
I just wanted you to know

39:45.074 --> 39:47.082
that we're all here rooting
for you,

39:47.518 --> 39:51.685
um, you have some new fans
by the way, but, uh,

39:51.721 --> 39:54.319
it seems to me, sir,
you're moving a little slow.

39:54.355 --> 39:55.452
I think that's you.

39:55.854 --> 39:57.428
Gonna need to see
some more hustle.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.387
All right,
I'll call you later, bye.

40:02.592 --> 40:03.830
Hi, Lucas.

40:05.634 --> 40:07.999
I stole your phone,
like the good old days.

40:10.067 --> 40:11.869
I didn't go through your photos
or anything

40:11.905 --> 40:13.838
but you should really
change your passcode,

40:13.874 --> 40:15.941
you've had the same one
since like fifth grade.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.308
Oh, a message from...

40:23.249 --> 40:24.279
Katie.

40:26.287 --> 40:27.315
Are you guys...

40:28.984 --> 40:30.252
are you guys back together.

40:31.726 --> 40:33.530
I mean, are you holding out
at me, Parker?

40:34.831 --> 40:37.127
Oh, cause we're gonna talk
about this when you wake up,

40:39.135 --> 40:40.163
if you ever do...

40:42.469 --> 40:46.303
Okay, um, thanks, guys.

40:46.338 --> 40:47.368
Uh...

40:48.514 --> 40:51.482
I didn't think leaving rehab
would be bittersweet,

40:53.277 --> 40:56.949
but, I guess I owe it to all
the amazing people here,

40:59.318 --> 41:00.348
so...

41:01.184 --> 41:05.826
Um, I know this hasn't been easy
for anyone,

41:06.295 --> 41:07.531
especially my family,

41:09.969 --> 41:13.163
and, when I got here

41:15.470 --> 41:17.332
I wanted to stay alive for them,

41:19.272 --> 41:20.302
but...

41:21.608 --> 41:23.646
now I want to stay alive for me.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.717
The world still scares me and...

41:30.150 --> 41:33.051
I have no idea what my life
looks like three months from now

41:34.389 --> 41:35.757
and that terrifies me,

41:38.029 --> 41:39.057
but I want it

41:40.900 --> 41:43.897
and that's something I honestly
couldn't have said
three months ago.

41:46.162 --> 41:49.496
I want to say thank you
to my mom

41:50.166 --> 41:52.840
for being my rock
no matter what,

41:54.704 --> 41:56.041
and just,

41:57.006 --> 41:58.439
yeah, always being there.

41:59.649 --> 42:02.012
Thank you
to all the amazing people here

42:02.047 --> 42:03.845
that were determined
to get through to me,

42:03.880 --> 42:05.589
especially Dr. Carter.

42:07.925 --> 42:08.955
And, um,

42:09.758 --> 42:13.355
I want to call out Lucas,
specifically,

42:14.091 --> 42:16.527
because he flew all
the way out here

42:16.562 --> 42:17.961
from Indianapolis,

42:17.996 --> 42:19.933
even when I said
it wasn't a big deal.

42:22.907 --> 42:23.970
Okay.

42:25.335 --> 42:30.108
So, Lucas, you have always
been my best friend.

42:32.444 --> 42:33.540
And...

42:34.747 --> 42:37.918
you've always chosen to see me.

42:40.123 --> 42:41.218
The real me.

42:43.220 --> 42:46.058
Even when I couldn't
or didn't want to.

42:48.731 --> 42:52.427
And, you made me laugh
through the tears

42:54.298 --> 42:57.102
and hugged me when I really,
really needed it.

43:00.808 --> 43:04.874
So, thanks for being
the best friend

43:04.909 --> 43:06.617
a depressed girl could ask for.

43:48.622 --> 43:49.792
-Daniel.
-All right.

43:51.522 --> 43:55.960
So, it's just we're doing the C,
and then a B, into the E.

43:55.995 --> 43:57.561
These are minor,
those two are minor.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.468
-Are we picking, or--
-Do a little finger pick.

44:01.503 --> 44:02.932
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

44:02.967 --> 44:04.832
-Nice.

44:04.868 --> 44:07.100
Aw... Shut up.

44:07.136 --> 44:08.478
-Shut up!
-No, no, no!

44:08.513 --> 44:10.175
You're nervous
because of the camera.

44:17.312 --> 44:18.854
I found the key,
I found the key.

44:22.321 --> 44:24.627
I don't know the key.
I found it, I found it again.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.623
Thought you were supposed
to be a musician?

44:26.659 --> 44:28.127
I'm nailing it.

44:28.162 --> 44:29.723
Thought you were supposed
to be this really cool...

44:30.192 --> 44:31.526
And maybe you are, a little bit.

44:33.231 --> 44:36.265
-I found it, I found it!
-...this whole time.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.504
-Sell yourself a little short.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.104
Excuse me,

44:40.140 --> 44:42.642
could you help me find a copy
of Ana Karenina?

44:42.677 --> 44:44.275
Mom, what are you doing here?

44:44.310 --> 44:46.675
I wanted to catch you
in your natural habitat.

44:47.244 --> 44:49.143
Since when do you read classic
novels?

44:49.178 --> 44:51.382
I read a lot, actually.

44:52.085 --> 44:54.758
Okay, well, if you'll follow me
this way.

44:55.325 --> 44:57.893
We have it here.

44:59.221 --> 45:00.487
You know this is huge, right?

45:00.522 --> 45:02.261
Like, do you even have time
to read this?

45:02.663 --> 45:03.966
I'll find time.

45:04.569 --> 45:05.994
-All right.
-Thank you.

45:06.029 --> 45:07.662
What excellent service.

45:07.698 --> 45:10.400
Well, you know, we try, we try,
so, please, please come back.

45:13.039 --> 45:15.639
Boom,
three hours post tattoo.

45:16.075 --> 45:17.674
Time for the big reveal,
you ready?

45:17.710 --> 45:19.474
Yep, here we go.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.513
-Why are you going
so slow?
-It hurts.

45:21.549 --> 45:24.215
That hurt-- you got
a tattoo and it's the tape
that hurts?

45:24.250 --> 45:26.316
-Yes.
-Just take--
just rip it off.

45:26.352 --> 45:28.385
-Shut up! Slow and steady.
-Go, go, go!

45:29.885 --> 45:30.926
Damn.

45:31.887 --> 45:32.929
Wow!

45:33.732 --> 45:36.099
-What do you think?
-I really like it.

45:36.935 --> 45:39.258
Well, good,
you're stuck with it
forever now.

45:39.294 --> 45:40.661
I'm stuck with it forever!

45:41.934 --> 45:44.599
Lucas come here, come here!

45:45.143 --> 45:46.368
Stop, okay.

45:46.403 --> 45:48.578
-Okay, you have the ring?
-Yes, of course.

45:48.613 --> 45:51.875
All right, you ready for this,
Parker?

45:51.910 --> 45:53.608
-Yeah, you?
-Yeah.

45:54.642 --> 45:56.386
Dan, thank you for doing this,
by the way.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.013
Dude, it's an honor.

45:58.049 --> 45:59.790
-Oh!

46:01.458 --> 46:02.916
Katie just got here.

46:02.952 --> 46:04.427
You ready?

46:04.463 --> 46:05.862
-It's game time!
-All right, go.

46:08.223 --> 46:09.761
Ready, babe?

46:09.796 --> 46:11.461
Yeah, uh, let's do this.

46:31.685 --> 46:32.988
Katie, I love you.

46:34.421 --> 46:36.557
Ever since I asked you out
three years ago to this day

46:36.592 --> 46:39.122
I knew you were special.

46:39.157 --> 46:41.865
I never knew
how kind and smart

46:43.193 --> 46:44.626
and insanely beautiful...

46:46.271 --> 46:50.071
There's nothing that I want more
than spend the rest of my life
with you

46:51.475 --> 46:52.502
as soon as possible.

46:54.640 --> 46:55.670
Katie...

46:56.680 --> 46:58.145
-Will you marry me?
-Oh, God.

46:59.141 --> 47:00.510
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

47:02.453 --> 47:03.945
So cute!

47:03.980 --> 47:05.152
Oh, my God.

47:06.315 --> 47:08.784
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

47:08.819 --> 47:09.860
What?

47:13.022 --> 47:14.755
Guys, what?

47:17.327 --> 47:19.597
It's so pretty,
you did so good.

47:19.632 --> 47:21.204
Oh...

47:21.240 --> 47:22.433
Love you too.

47:30.748 --> 47:32.674
Um, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

47:33.008 --> 47:34.145
Okay.

47:34.180 --> 47:35.776
That's the zoom,
you're doing right now,

47:35.811 --> 47:37.885
that's the zoom and you can use
that if you want to,

47:37.920 --> 47:39.483
everything else is on auto,
though.

47:39.518 --> 47:41.681
-Okay, I got it.
-Get it, you ready? All right.

47:41.717 --> 47:43.858
Day one of the road trip
and, uh, so far I think

47:43.893 --> 47:45.456
Mackenzie has eaten
all the snacks.

47:45.491 --> 47:48.157
No, I haven't, you liar.
I left you some carrots.

47:48.193 --> 47:49.625
Carrots?
That's all we have left?

47:51.034 --> 47:54.436
We are going to Dallas,
uh, from my band's show.

47:54.839 --> 47:57.303
And where's your band,
good sir?

47:58.367 --> 47:59.673
They're in the other car.

47:59.708 --> 48:00.875
And why is that?

48:01.277 --> 48:03.408
Because I wanted to spend
some alone time with my girl.

48:06.377 --> 48:07.845
Eyes on the road,
cool guy.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.918
It's a red light.

48:09.954 --> 48:12.420
-Turn the camera off.
-Okay, look at me.

48:24.461 --> 48:26.198
-Do you want some?
-Oh!

48:26.234 --> 48:28.466
-Do you want some?
-No, no, thanks.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.113
Okay, um...

48:39.113 --> 48:41.210
Lucas, I FaceTimed you
like six times,

48:41.245 --> 48:42.678
so, I guess you're pretty busy,

48:43.750 --> 48:44.779
but, um...

48:46.888 --> 48:48.750
I'm in Dallas with Daniel and...

48:50.890 --> 48:52.358
you were right.

48:52.393 --> 48:54.096
I really didn't want you
to be right, but, you were right

48:54.131 --> 48:57.899
and I think this is all just
a bit too much for me

48:57.934 --> 49:01.395
because some guy
just offered me coke

49:01.430 --> 49:03.699
and it was really hard to say no

49:04.468 --> 49:06.009
and I could have done it
but I didn't.

49:07.842 --> 49:09.111
Daniel's still inside.

49:10.081 --> 49:12.048
He's gonna kill me
when he finds out that I left.

49:13.416 --> 49:14.450
Shit.

49:15.119 --> 49:19.220
But, um, just... just call me
back when you can, okay?

49:20.458 --> 49:22.949
Kenzie, Kenz!

49:24.125 --> 49:25.655
Hey, what's up,
what are you doing?

49:26.657 --> 49:28.556
Let me in, I just,
I just want to talk to you.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.165
Are you fucking high
right now?

49:31.295 --> 49:33.430
No! God, no, of course not.

49:33.466 --> 49:35.570
Daniel, you said
you wouldn't do anything

49:35.606 --> 49:36.663
if I came with you.

49:36.698 --> 49:38.002
Look, just,
just come inside, okay?

49:38.037 --> 49:39.766
We're about to put...

49:39.802 --> 49:42.607
-No, fuck this.
-We can talk about this.

49:42.643 --> 49:43.776
Hey!

49:43.812 --> 49:44.779
Hey, where the fuck?

49:44.814 --> 49:46.478
You can't take my car, bitch!

49:50.952 --> 49:54.387
Hello, world. Mackenzie here.

49:56.654 --> 49:58.886
I just decided to make
this video because...

50:00.158 --> 50:01.856
I didn't have it for me

50:03.032 --> 50:05.200
when I was battling
my depression,

50:07.163 --> 50:08.236
and um...

50:10.370 --> 50:12.273
I just felt
that it was really important.

50:14.846 --> 50:19.874
Today is the one-year
anniversary

50:21.576 --> 50:23.185
of when I attempted suicide.

50:25.483 --> 50:27.882
A lot has changed since then,
um...

50:29.353 --> 50:31.226
but a lot is still the same.

50:32.653 --> 50:34.528
Like I still have depression,

50:34.563 --> 50:36.227
um...

50:36.263 --> 50:37.925
some days are better
than others,

50:40.504 --> 50:41.566
and um...

50:44.099 --> 50:48.710
my future and who I want to be
in this world is still...

50:49.412 --> 50:54.084
really fuzzy to me
and overwhelming for me
to think about.

50:56.180 --> 50:59.419
But, I want it.

51:05.387 --> 51:06.492
Hi, everybody.

51:07.192 --> 51:08.626
My name is Mackenzie

51:09.561 --> 51:12.498
and this is my first time
performing.

51:14.203 --> 51:17.503
This is dedicated
to my best friend Lucas,

51:18.070 --> 51:20.000
wherever you are.

51:22.077 --> 51:23.844
He knows
that I'm too competitive

51:23.879 --> 51:25.841
to turn down a bet, so.

51:26.883 --> 51:28.008

in a car crash

52:49.993 --> 52:53.593
and it's something to do

Hey.

55:07.271 --> 55:08.929
You're gonna have
a lot of these videos

55:08.965 --> 55:11.433
when you wake up,
so, sorry not sorry.

55:11.468 --> 55:13.706
I guess.

55:16.775 --> 55:18.843
It's just really hard
not talking to you.

55:23.888 --> 55:24.915
I know what it's like

55:26.023 --> 55:27.918
to have to fight to stay alive.

55:30.190 --> 55:31.724
To want to even,

55:34.229 --> 55:35.788
and I know that you are Lucas,

55:35.823 --> 55:37.532
but please, I need you

55:39.166 --> 55:40.194
to fight harder

55:42.671 --> 55:46.508
and I hope that somehow you know
that I'm fighting too.

55:48.473 --> 55:49.709
Every day is so hard.

55:52.341 --> 55:55.885
I want to reuse and I want
to slip back into old habits

55:55.920 --> 55:58.421
but I'm not and I won't,

55:59.190 --> 56:02.117
because, I'm going to be there
for you.

56:04.655 --> 56:05.890
The same way you were for me.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.231
Attempt number 200.

56:15.666 --> 56:17.473
Whatever to get you to wake up.

56:38.058 --> 56:39.026
Oh!

56:39.061 --> 56:40.521
-Hey.
-Hey.

56:41.860 --> 56:44.390
I just came to check on him
before I leave.

56:45.362 --> 56:46.392
Yeah.

56:48.206 --> 56:49.769
God,
it's so hard to look at him.

56:51.740 --> 56:53.971
Oh, I mean his hair just needs
a little work, you know.

56:56.104 --> 56:57.579
I don't know
how I'm gonna do this.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.013
Katie, we're all just taking it
day by day.

57:01.048 --> 57:02.078
No, Mac,

57:02.885 --> 57:03.948
like...

57:04.879 --> 57:06.115
I don't know if I can.

57:07.925 --> 57:08.953
What do you mean?

57:09.751 --> 57:11.351
It's just, like...

57:12.094 --> 57:13.661
this is a lot.

57:15.332 --> 57:17.357
All the time,
I'm all messed up too.

57:18.126 --> 57:20.528
Katie, he's gonna wake up,
he's...

57:20.564 --> 57:21.636
It was my fault.

57:23.268 --> 57:24.331
What?

57:28.011 --> 57:29.105
I ran the light.

57:30.348 --> 57:32.779
It was yellow already
but I hit the gas.

57:33.848 --> 57:35.980
I mean, we were running late
and I hate running...

57:38.289 --> 57:40.050
The drunk hit us
but I put us there.

57:40.984 --> 57:43.759
I mean, if we hadn't been going
so fast,

57:43.794 --> 57:45.053
that...

57:45.088 --> 57:46.820
it wouldn't have been
that he wouldn't...

57:46.856 --> 57:47.992
-Katie...
-I'm sorry.

57:53.001 --> 57:54.064
Shit!

57:58.206 --> 57:59.474
Hey, everyone.

57:59.509 --> 58:01.676
Just wanted to give you guys
a quick update.

58:02.870 --> 58:04.008
Look who woke up!

58:06.343 --> 58:08.614
Thank you guys
for all your notes
and encouragement.

58:08.649 --> 58:10.250
No, seriously,
like, you're the best.

58:11.153 --> 58:14.283
He has some tests
he has to go do, so,
we'll talk to you guys later.

58:14.319 --> 58:15.681
Bye!

58:28.831 --> 58:30.131
What are you doing?

58:30.167 --> 58:32.234
I was just trying
to get you to wake up.

58:37.377 --> 58:38.779
This is so stupid!

58:42.912 --> 58:45.511
Physical therapy day one!

58:47.256 --> 58:49.683
Parker! Parker! Parker!

58:50.352 --> 58:52.288
He really likes the blanket
you made him, mom,

58:52.323 --> 58:55.397
especially because it matches
the bear that Katie got him,

58:55.432 --> 58:59.701
but I don't know
where that's at, but...

59:01.201 --> 59:02.231
Oh...

59:03.368 --> 59:04.697
Day 23.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.807
Wait, Lucas,
where's your crutches.

59:07.903 --> 59:09.036
It's no big deal, Mac.

59:09.405 --> 59:11.642
Yes, it is, you're going
to hurt yourself, stop.

59:11.677 --> 59:13.071
It doesn't matter, Mackenzie.

59:13.107 --> 59:14.373
Lucas, listen to me.

59:14.408 --> 59:16.311
I need to. Mackenzie, it's fine,
just put...

59:20.083 --> 59:21.657
Lucas look what came
in the...

59:23.962 --> 59:25.089
Are you okay?

59:27.062 --> 59:28.092
No...

59:31.263 --> 59:33.694
My doctor told my coach
that I couldn't play
next season,

59:33.730 --> 59:34.769
so they cut me.

59:36.767 --> 59:38.102
Lucas, I'm...

59:39.141 --> 59:40.170
I'm sorry.

59:43.741 --> 59:44.812
Is that your letter?

59:45.610 --> 59:46.682
Yeah, but...

59:48.948 --> 59:50.684
-Come on, pass me the camera.
-No.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.748
Your mom always wants recordings
of this stuff.

59:52.783 --> 59:53.854
We don't have to.

1:00:00.222 --> 1:00:01.763
Alright, step one,
go back.

1:00:02.565 --> 1:00:04.161
-Here.
-Yeah, that's good.

1:00:06.601 --> 1:00:08.638
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1:00:15.309 --> 1:00:16.338
I like that.

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:19.275
I got in.

1:00:20.613 --> 1:00:22.344
Yeah, congrats.

1:00:23.317 --> 1:00:24.379
Seriously.

1:00:29.358 --> 1:00:31.023
Welcome home.

1:00:37.267 --> 1:00:38.327
Where are you going?

1:00:42.265 --> 1:00:44.004
I don't know.
I'm just kind of tired, Mac.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.039
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's fine.

1:00:48.204 --> 1:00:50.713
Thanks for the poster,
it's cool.

1:00:52.010 --> 1:00:53.507
Yeah,
do you need anything?

1:00:54.879 --> 1:00:56.752
No, I'll just take a nap.

1:00:57.351 --> 1:00:58.380
Okay.

1:01:03.150 --> 1:01:05.422
Good job, strong kicks.

1:01:05.457 --> 1:01:06.520
Nice!

1:01:09.825 --> 1:01:11.393
Okay, stop.

1:01:18.176 --> 1:01:19.775
There you go, nice!

1:01:31.689 --> 1:01:34.856
-Hi, here's the rest
of your stuff.
-Thanks.

1:01:35.917 --> 1:01:36.957
How is he?

1:01:38.987 --> 1:01:40.961
He's doing okay.

1:01:42.595 --> 1:01:43.689
See you around.

1:01:45.267 --> 1:01:46.362
I'm glad,

1:01:47.271 --> 1:01:48.298
you know, that, um,

1:01:49.364 --> 1:01:51.503
you were there for him
during all this

1:01:51.539 --> 1:01:53.468
when I couldn't be.

1:01:55.377 --> 1:01:56.438
He's really lucky.

1:01:59.711 --> 1:02:00.783
Well, he's...

1:02:01.715 --> 1:02:04.215
he's my best friend, so...

1:02:16.630 --> 1:02:17.997
We're gonna get it.

1:02:18.032 --> 1:02:19.659
Lucas we're gonna get it,
we're gonna get it.

1:02:20.965 --> 1:02:22.234
Still got a long way to go.

1:02:22.936 --> 1:02:24.598
Yeah, but,
they're making a comeback.

1:02:39.782 --> 1:02:40.823
Katie.

1:02:45.557 --> 1:02:46.788
Hey...

1:02:46.823 --> 1:02:47.929
Hey, Katie!

1:02:54.767 --> 1:02:55.937
What are you doing here?

1:03:01.268 --> 1:03:02.702
They, they cut me, but,

1:03:04.613 --> 1:03:06.442
but you already knew that, huh?

1:03:07.351 --> 1:03:08.477
I didn't know that.

1:03:10.985 --> 1:03:12.720
Yeah, you did.
That's why you dumped me.

1:03:12.755 --> 1:03:14.456
Because I couldn't play soccer
anymore.

1:03:14.491 --> 1:03:15.924
That's not true and you know it.

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:18.093
As soon as things get tough,
Katie's out. Good-bye.

1:03:18.129 --> 1:03:19.425
Jump ship.

1:03:19.461 --> 1:03:20.522
You need to go.

1:03:23.533 --> 1:03:25.032
I can't believe you dumped me.

1:03:28.265 --> 1:03:30.004
You dumped
your crippled fiancé...

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.308
You wanted to be over too.

1:03:33.344 --> 1:03:35.339
No, no, no I didn't.

1:03:36.208 --> 1:03:37.839
I remember the way
that you looked at me

1:03:37.875 --> 1:03:38.914
in the hospital.

1:03:39.711 --> 1:03:40.806
Every day,

1:03:41.844 --> 1:03:43.275
like...

1:03:43.311 --> 1:03:44.676
like it was all my fault.

1:03:44.711 --> 1:03:46.917
Like I took away everything
that you ever...

1:03:47.687 --> 1:03:50.492
How were we supposed to get
married when you looked at me
like that.

1:03:50.527 --> 1:03:52.862
No, that's bullshit. Bullshit.

1:03:54.388 --> 1:03:56.830
So you can't reply to my texts,

1:03:56.866 --> 1:03:58.527
but you can show up
to my house drunk?

1:03:59.964 --> 1:04:01.695
That's bullshit, Lucas.

1:04:42.938 --> 1:04:43.979
Um.

1:04:47.207 --> 1:04:48.280
Hey, Lucas.

1:04:50.716 --> 1:04:52.086
I've been...

1:04:53.590 --> 1:04:55.122
thinking about this a lot

1:04:58.553 --> 1:05:00.259
and it's really hard for me
to say,

1:05:01.792 --> 1:05:02.822
but,

1:05:04.031 --> 1:05:05.759
things are getting
out of control,

1:05:07.098 --> 1:05:09.169
and, I've told you this before

1:05:10.436 --> 1:05:14.108
but you didn't believe me
and you really should.

1:05:20.412 --> 1:05:23.276
I couldn't even get you
to the couch this time

1:05:23.311 --> 1:05:24.448
before you passed out.

1:05:30.159 --> 1:05:32.522
Look, I know what it's like
to just hate everything.

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:36.025
To resent everything
and everyone.

1:05:36.060 --> 1:05:37.131
I know what it's like

1:05:38.799 --> 1:05:39.969
better than most people.

1:05:45.735 --> 1:05:47.834
I know what you're going
through but it has to stop.

1:05:52.110 --> 1:05:53.939
If not for you then for me.

1:05:57.513 --> 1:06:01.083
It's not easy for me to be
around you

1:06:01.118 --> 1:06:02.189
when you're so out of it

1:06:03.917 --> 1:06:05.995
because it makes me
want to be out of it too.

1:06:09.130 --> 1:06:11.560
God knows it feels great
to just check out

1:06:11.596 --> 1:06:13.827
when things get bad,
but I can't do that anymore.

1:06:20.541 --> 1:06:21.638
So,

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:28.017
consider this your wake-up call,
your intervention or whatever.

1:06:31.482 --> 1:06:33.512
You can be so much more
than this, Lucas.

1:06:33.547 --> 1:06:35.519
You are so much more than this.

1:06:38.988 --> 1:06:40.062
Um...

1:06:41.194 --> 1:06:44.990
so for now,
I'm not gonna come over.

1:06:49.632 --> 1:06:51.403
I know it doesn't seem like it
but there...

1:06:52.304 --> 1:06:55.077
is more to life
than Katie and soccer.

1:06:57.844 --> 1:07:01.116
Your future looks different now
but that doesn't have to be
a bad thing.

1:07:06.752 --> 1:07:07.848
Alright.

1:07:09.856 --> 1:07:11.291
Alright, Lucas.

1:07:12.655 --> 1:07:14.623
You're gonna watch this
every single morning

1:07:14.658 --> 1:07:17.231
and you're gonna remember
these three things.

1:07:20.161 --> 1:07:21.235
One,

1:07:22.167 --> 1:07:23.938
you gotta take it day by day,

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:28.473
alright, and every day, I mean,
something's just gonna get
a little bit better.

1:07:30.578 --> 1:07:31.608
Two,

1:07:35.218 --> 1:07:37.911
enough with the booze, man,
it doesn't do shit.

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:40.419
And three, like,

1:07:42.219 --> 1:07:45.754
you're doing this for yourself
for the man that you know
that you are, but,

1:07:48.127 --> 1:07:49.428
but you're doing it for Mac.

1:07:51.030 --> 1:07:52.101
Because you love her

1:07:55.401 --> 1:07:57.271
and you can't keep hurting her
like this.

1:08:03.943 --> 1:08:05.807
Okay. Every day.

1:08:15.590 --> 1:08:16.620

1:08:22.260 --> 1:08:24.497
Mom, are you recording a video?

1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:26.798
She always records,
you know that.

1:08:26.834 --> 1:08:28.235
Mm-hmm.

1:08:28.271 --> 1:08:30.502
You'll be thankful
for these videos one day, okay?

1:08:31.134 --> 1:08:32.174
Trust me.

1:08:34.171 --> 1:08:35.210
Actually, Mac.

1:08:35.811 --> 1:08:37.938
While the camera is out.

1:09:04.939 --> 1:09:05.999
Are you gonna open it?

1:09:15.949 --> 1:09:17.252
"Best coach."

1:09:18.450 --> 1:09:20.013

with your kids

1:09:21.822 --> 1:09:22.851

1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:28.123
I can still kick a soccer ball,
wait for it...

1:09:28.159 --> 1:09:29.858
Whatever, God.

1:09:30.858 --> 1:09:32.658
She won't even look up,
watch.

1:09:32.693 --> 1:09:35.932
Hey, Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

What do you think I'm doing?
What are you doing?

1:09:41.844 --> 1:09:43.443
Uh? Homework?

1:09:47.513 --> 1:09:49.713
Come on, let's hustle,
let's hustle!

1:09:52.184 --> 1:09:53.783
Yo, what time is it?

1:10:03.929 --> 1:10:04.959
Alright.

1:10:06.032 --> 1:10:07.066
Keep up the pace.

1:10:07.568 --> 1:10:10.368
Wait, Lucas, what,
what was your career assessment?

1:10:10.403 --> 1:10:12.736
-Okay, Mac, please no...
-Stop!

1:10:13.270 --> 1:10:15.838

1:10:15.873 --> 1:10:18.640
-Wow! What would you even do?
-I don't even know, Mac.

1:10:18.675 --> 1:10:20.515
You know what?
Oh, Magic Lucas.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:22.242
Uh-huh.

1:10:22.277 --> 1:10:24.042
I think thousands
of people will pay to come
and see you.

1:10:24.077 --> 1:10:25.884
I just wasted 30 minutes
of my life on this.

1:10:25.919 --> 1:10:27.081
Vegas!

1:10:27.884 --> 1:10:29.988
Guys! Come on!
You're gonna miss it.

1:10:36.865 --> 1:10:38.597
Happy new year!

Lucas Parker.

1:12:31.376 --> 1:12:32.877
What does this say?

1:12:33.346 --> 1:12:37.914
What? "Mac I am writing this

1:12:38.846 --> 1:12:41.214
from the plane." Is that plane?

1:12:41.816 --> 1:12:45.889
Um, "I keep thinking about what

1:12:47.087 --> 1:12:49.129
something year old Lucas
would say,"

1:12:49.164 --> 1:12:50.762
Oh 12-year-old Lucas would say.

1:12:51.602 --> 1:12:52.632
Why,

1:12:54.201 --> 1:12:56.996
why did we, the plastic?

1:12:57.032 --> 1:13:00.365
Oh, why did we wait
till the last day.

1:13:02.707 --> 1:13:05.579
I don't know why,
why did we wait.

1:13:08.180 --> 1:13:09.242
Hey, Mac.

1:13:10.416 --> 1:13:11.882
On my way to the library.

1:13:12.383 --> 1:13:13.719
Bring my study on.

1:13:16.589 --> 1:13:18.427
See what's up,
see what you're doing.

1:13:19.927 --> 1:13:22.725
I had a walk, uh, I had to walk
through the soccer field today

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:24.159
and the whole team was there,
so.

1:13:24.895 --> 1:13:27.760
It wasn't that great
but, but, hey, I gotta,

1:13:28.229 --> 1:13:30.439
I got a kinesiology midterm
to study for, so.

1:13:31.439 --> 1:13:33.266
Call me in like, what,
three hours.

1:13:35.608 --> 1:13:37.171
I'll definitely need
to pick me up.

1:13:39.573 --> 1:13:40.614
Bye.

1:13:42.615 --> 1:13:45.278
So, my mom really misses you,
Lucas.

1:13:46.789 --> 1:13:48.014
Yep.

1:13:48.383 --> 1:13:51.790
All I do is sit in my room
all day listening to sad music.

1:13:53.260 --> 1:13:54.694
It's pitiful, really.

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:58.159
Yeah, but, it's okay, because,

1:13:58.761 --> 1:14:00.535
Mac bought me plane tickets.

1:14:00.971 --> 1:14:01.998
Wait, what, I didn't...

1:14:03.603 --> 1:14:05.402
Oh, my God, wait,
are you serious?

1:14:05.437 --> 1:14:08.139
-Yeah.
-Wait a minute.

1:14:08.608 --> 1:14:11.143
Are you...
Are you into this Parker?

1:14:11.579 --> 1:14:13.713
What is happening?
I got to pack. Hold on.

1:14:17.284 --> 1:14:18.520
How many are you taking?

1:14:19.419 --> 1:14:20.720
I haven't taken one yet.

1:14:21.288 --> 1:14:22.315
Hurry up. It's cold.

1:14:27.755 --> 1:14:28.794
Did you take it?

1:14:32.632 --> 1:14:34.162
-It might be a video.
-What?

1:14:35.628 --> 1:14:38.499
Is there something you want
to remember about this, Parker?

1:14:38.535 --> 1:14:39.574
Always.

1:14:40.634 --> 1:14:41.675
Here.

1:14:46.182 --> 1:14:48.407
What are you thinking about?

1:14:54.491 --> 1:14:56.415
Thinking about how this feels
really great.

1:14:58.661 --> 1:15:01.893

to feel right again.
