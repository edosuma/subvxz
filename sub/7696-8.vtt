01:06.274 --> 01:08.192
<i>Previously</i> on Batman...

01:08.985 --> 01:10.570
Perfect, my love.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.988
Let's go home.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.492
<i>So, our new cat burglar
is a woman.</i>

01:17.034 --> 01:19.662
You see, we're committed
to building a major resort.

01:19.787 --> 01:23.249
The land is in the middle of nowhere.
It's worthless except to Wildcats.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.960
Tomorrow at 2300 hours,

01:26.043 --> 01:30.006
a train under military escort
will pass through Gotham.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.926
We'll hit the train
outside the city, at this point.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.265
What is that?

01:39.599 --> 01:42.935
A cat at the end of its nine lives.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.689
I'll have to try
and trim those claws.

01:47.648 --> 01:48.816
Hey!

01:55.197 --> 01:57.533
Never trifle
with the affections of a woman.

01:57.658 --> 01:59.076
Until next time.

02:00.077 --> 02:02.413
And there will be a next time.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.994
You're late.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.332
Can't you ever walk up to someone
normal-like?

02:46.415 --> 02:48.459
I hear you have
some information.

02:48.542 --> 02:51.170
Under one condition.
Lay off the South Side.

02:54.298 --> 02:56.550
Keep this up,
and I'll be on you from all sides.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.844
North, south, east and west.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.138
Okay! I get the picture.

03:04.975 --> 03:07.186
There's rumors about some train heist.

03:07.603 --> 03:09.188
- When?
- Tonight.

03:09.271 --> 03:10.272
Red Claw?

03:11.315 --> 03:12.733
Don't know. It's real sketchy.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.360
One thing I can tell you,

03:14.443 --> 03:16.612
no one in the organization
is making the hit.

03:16.987 --> 03:18.531
These are outsiders.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.871
There's nothing here in the schedules.

03:27.623 --> 03:28.958
A last-minute change?

03:29.291 --> 03:30.292
I'd have been told.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.671
What if it was a military train?

03:34.088 --> 03:36.465
Something the government
wouldn't want us to know about?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.759
Wouldn't be the first time.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.011
Blasted Feds and their secrets.

03:52.356 --> 03:54.775
You know, when I saw
those army commercials on TV,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.445
they never said anything
about guarding no plague.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.114
Who'd want to steal
a can of germs, anyway?

04:41.947 --> 04:43.073
Huh?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.463
That's got to do it.

05:57.189 --> 05:58.691
Red Claw, watch out!

05:59.692 --> 06:01.318
Red Claw, a woman?

06:01.902 --> 06:03.863
Do you have a problem with that?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.698
Not at all.

06:05.781 --> 06:07.908
I'm an equal-opportunity crime fighter.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.410
Stay back, Batman!

06:09.535 --> 06:11.996
I hold the ultimate equalizer.

06:12.454 --> 06:15.416
This plague kills indiscriminately.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.667
You'll die, too.

06:17.084 --> 06:20.337
Along with everyone else
within a 10-mile radius.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.339
Can you risk it, Batman?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.092
Go on, call my bluff.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.971
You've finally met your match, Batman.

06:29.054 --> 06:31.807
Not surprising it's a woman.

06:34.226 --> 06:36.437
Yes, General, but if you'd warned us
about this shipment

06:36.520 --> 06:37.771
we might've had a chance.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.524
<i>So,</i> what <i>do</i> I <i>do</i> now,

06:40.608 --> 06:42.443
evacuate 10 million people?

06:42.526 --> 06:44.987
Maybe we can set up camp
around the Pentagon.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.198
Listen, General, I'll call you back.

06:52.369 --> 06:53.370
Gordon here.

06:53.996 --> 06:54.997
Batman.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.123
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

06:56.206 --> 06:57.791
Have you heard from Red Claw?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.460
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

06:59.835 --> 07:03.422
<i>We've got 24 hours to come up
with $1 billion in gold bullion,</i>

07:03.714 --> 07:05.799
<i>or she'll release the plague on Gotham.</i>

07:06.342 --> 07:09.970
<i>To think, all this time
the Feds have been looking for a man.</i>

07:10.387 --> 07:13.557
Lately I'm learning
never to underestimate the opposite sex.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.892
I'll be in touch.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.487
Bruce and Selina go to lunch, take two.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.823
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to seeing you again.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.243
Well, this time, I promise
a much more exciting date

07:33.327 --> 07:34.328
than our last one.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.168
Hey.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.003
This time you seem preoccupied.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.339
Sorry.

07:45.422 --> 07:47.091
An unexpected crisis.

07:47.383 --> 07:48.384
You, on the other hand,

07:48.467 --> 07:50.678
look like the cat
who swallowed the canary.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.848
Things are going very well
on the mountain lion front.

07:55.307 --> 07:57.101
I may get that land from Multigon yet.

07:57.434 --> 07:58.435
Really?

07:58.894 --> 08:00.270
What did you find out?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.356
Let's just say, they plan on playing

08:02.439 --> 08:04.608
more than shuffleboard
up at their resort.

08:05.901 --> 08:06.944
What in...

08:08.612 --> 08:09.613
Watch out!

08:10.864 --> 08:12.282
An old boyfriend?

08:13.951 --> 08:16.203
Here go your nine lives, kitty-cat.

08:42.646 --> 08:44.648
- Busy fellow.
- What?

08:45.774 --> 08:47.317
Nothing. Hang on.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.222
Brace yourself.

09:40.537 --> 09:41.997
Where'd you learn to drive like that?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.292
Oh, I've been going
to the Paris Grand Prix for years.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.336
You know, one of these days,
I think I'll enter it.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.180
Well, you did

09:58.263 --> 09:59.556
promise me an exciting time.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.684
It's not every date
where I get to fill out police reports.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.561
Thanks for seeing me up.

10:04.853 --> 10:07.272
Just wanted to be sure
they didn't try anything else.

10:08.857 --> 10:10.859
What makes you think
they weren't after you?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.319
A nice guy like me?

10:16.448 --> 10:17.699
Good night, Bruce.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.119
Selina, if you're
in some kind of trouble,

10:20.202 --> 10:21.203
I wish you'd tell me.

10:21.703 --> 10:22.871
Perhaps I can help.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.833
I really care about you.

10:26.291 --> 10:29.044
I haven't felt this way
in a long, long time.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.796
Thanks, Bruce.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.216
But I've never been able
to play the damsel in distress.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.510
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.564
But, why would someone
at Multigon try to kill you?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.774
Ten to one, it has to do
with those bunkers

10:50.858 --> 10:52.151
under their resort site.

10:58.782 --> 11:01.285
I think it's time I do some digging.

11:04.746 --> 11:05.998
Not this time, Isis.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.709
I'm afraid where I'm going,
they don't allow pets.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.212
It's not that I question
your instincts, sir,

11:12.296 --> 11:15.841
but why would Red Claw
wish to harm Ms. Kyle?

11:16.091 --> 11:17.426
Why, indeed.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.263
But somehow,
Selina has crossed Red Claw's path,

11:21.638 --> 11:23.307
and I mean to find out where.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.729
What an unusual color.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.689
Ms. Kyle's, I presume.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.449
No. It's a cat hair.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.994
Curious, never seen one
quite that color.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.497
Batman has.

12:53.897 --> 12:55.399
Get away!

13:02.281 --> 13:03.407
Huh?

13:34.104 --> 13:35.439
I won't hurt you.

13:36.189 --> 13:38.525
Red Claw is after you and Catwoman.

13:39.609 --> 13:42.070
Catwoman? What are you talking about?

13:42.237 --> 13:44.406
Maven, you must tell me
where she's gone.

13:44.489 --> 13:45.907
These people are killers.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.246
The Multigon site.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.166
You're not safe here anymore.

13:54.374 --> 13:55.917
Is there somewhere you can hide?

13:56.418 --> 13:58.420
Well, I guess I could go-

13:58.545 --> 14:00.213
Shh. Go quickly.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.593
As long as you know who she is,
you should know how she feels.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.720
She's in love with you.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.044
This ought to keep you out of my hair.

15:11.743 --> 15:14.788
These will certainly
enhance the resort's brochure.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.754
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.886
I didn't think you cared.

15:29.970 --> 15:30.971
Come on!

15:32.681 --> 15:33.974
You've got to get out of here.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.268
Me? What about you?

15:36.351 --> 15:37.978
There's something I have to pick up.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.276
Welcome to my little resort.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.573
Plan on a short stay.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.755
It's never dull, is it, Batman?

16:06.214 --> 16:07.883
You may be surprised to know

16:07.966 --> 16:11.303
these accommodations
are courtesy of your government.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.892
They built this top-secret facility
to shelter high officials

16:16.975 --> 16:19.311
in case of a nuclear incident.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.648
Since you wanted
the plague so badly, Batman,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.319
we've decided to give it to you.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.824
What will you use to blackmail Gotham
if you waste it on us?

16:33.283 --> 16:36.161
Why risk carrying such deadly contents,

16:36.244 --> 16:38.330
when a placebo will do?

16:39.873 --> 16:42.709
By the time they realize
the vial is a fake,

16:42.834 --> 16:46.671
we'll be miles away
with their billion dollars.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.259
The acid should eat through
in a matter of minutes.

16:51.801 --> 16:55.263
Sound evacuation,
and begin sealing the compound.

16:56.556 --> 16:59.518
We wouldn't want the plague
to harm the precious wildlife,

16:59.976 --> 17:01.686
just the vermin in here.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.360
Ugh. Would I like to
get my claws into them.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.196
If I could just get some slack...

17:12.155 --> 17:14.783
What this situation needs
is a woman's touch.

17:31.841 --> 17:33.051
What a team.

17:33.885 --> 17:34.886
Come on!

17:46.022 --> 17:47.399
You've got to get out of here.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.067
Not without you.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.986
I'll be right behind you.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.238
But first,
I've got to destroy the plague.

17:53.905 --> 17:54.906
Now go!

17:58.702 --> 17:59.744
Please.

19:41.930 --> 19:42.931
Batman.

19:51.606 --> 19:53.483
This is
Police Commissioner Gordon.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.610
<i>You're completely surrounded.</i>

19:55.860 --> 19:57.195
<i>Give yourselves up.</i>

20:02.617 --> 20:04.619
Right where Batman said they'd be.

20:05.453 --> 20:07.414
Looks like this resort is folding.

20:09.749 --> 20:11.292
So are you.

20:11.876 --> 20:14.671
For years, I've fought
to build my network.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.300
I brought countries to their knees.

20:23.012 --> 20:25.890
You will pay, pussycat.

20:29.477 --> 20:33.440
You will learn
why everyone fears Red Claw.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.286
Thank you, friend.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.377
Something for you to remember me by.

20:54.794 --> 20:56.004
Hmm.

21:01.676 --> 21:03.386
Batman, where's the virus?

21:04.262 --> 21:05.722
It went up in smoke,

21:06.139 --> 21:07.724
with Red Claw's future.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.060
I should've known you'd have it all
wrapped up before we got here.

21:13.354 --> 21:14.355
Almost.

21:21.905 --> 21:22.906
Maven?

21:25.033 --> 21:26.034
Maven?

21:26.910 --> 21:27.911
She's gone.

21:28.703 --> 21:30.747
The terrorists were after both of you.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.543
Have you told the police
you found your cat burglar?

21:36.252 --> 21:37.253
Not yet.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.588
Why not?

21:39.422 --> 21:41.925
I didn't want you taken away
like a common criminal.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.260
So, you do care.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.559
More than you will ever know.

22:19.712 --> 22:20.713
English - SDH
