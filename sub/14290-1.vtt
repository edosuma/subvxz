Coffee and a taco.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.625
- Yes, sir?
- Make mine the same.

Hey, this is good coffee.
This is wonderfuI coffee.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.310
How about you?

06:47.323 --> 06:48.990

- Hey, officers,

06:49.117 --> 06:52.577
you're not gonna Ieave without
finishing your coffee, are you?

06:52.703 --> 06:54.621
AII that nice, good coffee?

06:57.166 --> 07:00.085
That stuff's expensive.
You shouIdn't waste it Iike that.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.549
Say, you know where I can find

07:37.498 --> 07:38.874
Argh!

You saved my beautifuI bIack ass.
You reaIIy did.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.550
Mm-hm.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.719
And you better have
a mighty good reason

08:32.845 --> 08:35.013
why those hoods were after it, too.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.520
WeII, practicaIIy nothin'.
A Iousy two or three days.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.441
Come on, Link. You're not taIking to
one of your jive-ass friends.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.194
I'm your sister. Give it to me straight.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.571
I am. Now, Iisten.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.329
I had to borrow a few bucks
to go into business.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.250
From a Ioan shark, right?

09:04.585 --> 09:08.713
The Bank of America ain't started
givin' out mortgages on numbers banks.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.340
OK, OK. So what happened?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.636
What do you think the odds are
against 500 peopIe hitting the number

09:14.762 --> 09:16.596
on Martin Luther King's birthday?

09:17.932 --> 09:22.102
- So how much did you go down for?
- A Iousy 20 grand or so.

09:23.688 --> 09:29.276
But I wouIda had it aII back if they'd just
give me a Iousy two or three more days.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.777
Oh, Link!

09:31.279 --> 09:34.573
After aII you've been through.
When are you gonna Iearn?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.908
Look, it's a Iegitimate business.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.411
WeII, aImost.

09:40.371 --> 09:44.541
But it's better than bein' a paid informer
Iike that big-shot boyfriend of yours.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.168
And where is he now?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.254
ProbabIy at the bottom of the river

09:49.380 --> 09:51.590
poIIuting it
with his feet in a bucket of cement.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.841
Shut up about him, Link!

09:56.095 --> 09:57.178
OK.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.268
But I was doin' fine before,
deaIin' coke.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.021
And then you came down on me for that.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.734
Oh, aII right.

10:13.237 --> 10:17.741
I guess you're gonna have to stay here
untiI I can think of what to do.

10:17.867 --> 10:22.370
Thanks, baby. And them peopIe
don't know nothin' about you at aII.

10:22.496 --> 10:26.124
And that's another thing.
As Iong as you're under this roof

10:26.250 --> 10:30.503
you gotta promise me to stay away
from them peopIe and outta the rackets.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.131
Foxy, Iook, I'm a bIack man.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.051
I don't know how to sing,
I don't know how to dance,

10:36.177 --> 10:38.345
or how to preach to no congregation.

10:38.471 --> 10:43.224
I'm too smaII to be a footbaII hero
and I'm too ugIy to be eIected mayor.

10:44.185 --> 10:49.272
But I watch TV and I see aII them peopIe
in aII them fine homes they Iive in

10:49.398 --> 10:52.275
and aII them nice cars they drive,

10:52.401 --> 10:54.778
and I get aII fuII of ambition.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.783
Now, you teII me
what I'm supposed to do

10:59.909 --> 11:02.243
with aII this ambition I got.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.746
I don't know, Link.

11:04.872 --> 11:09.334
I just don't wanna see you end up in jaiI
or shot down in the street somewhere.

11:11.879 --> 11:17.258
Baby, jaiI is where some of the finest
peopIe I know are these days.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.058
A car came out of nowhere.

11:25.184 --> 11:29.270
Now, what kind of a buIIshit story is that?
What car? Who was it?

11:29.397 --> 11:34.526
How shouId I know? You sent us to take
care of one IittIe punk bIack-ass deaIer.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.695
You said nothin' about his havin' friends.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.448
Eddie, junk deaIers don't have friends.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.952
- Did you at Ieast get a Iook at him?
- It was pretty dark.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.954
But, I teII ya,
it Iooked Iike a broad to me.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.706
A broad?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.126
What do you suppose
these two were smokin'?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.838
You know I don't drink
or smoke or nothin', Mr EIias.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.756
Eddie!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.802
Yes, Miss Katherine.

12:11.397 --> 12:15.400
Of course,
things don't aIways go smoothIy.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.696
EspeciaIIy when one becomes careIess.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.326
I'm sure he won't be so careIess again.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.872
No, Miss Katherine. I sure won't.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.499

12:32.501 --> 12:36.087
D'you know what happens when
we Iet these peopIe get away with it?

12:36.213 --> 12:39.716
- Yeah, they'II do it again!
- No, stupid.

12:40.676 --> 12:45.972
No, what she means is
the word gets out aII over town

12:46.098 --> 12:49.809
and then nothing we say means shit!

12:49.935 --> 12:51.478
Huh?

12:53.647 --> 12:57.025
He won't get away with it,
Miss Katherine. I promise.

I can't check you out officiaIIy
untiI tomorrow.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.184
I guess he's gotta try it out
on the street sometime.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.688
WeII, you aII have some things to taIk
about. I'II see you tomorrow, MichaeI.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.161
I guess this is the time
that you'II be needing these things, Mike.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.123
There's a birth certificate.

18:46.708 --> 18:52.171
Driver's Iicence, credit cards, sociaI
security numbers, a Iot of other things.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.174
And...

18:56.677 --> 18:59.762
You might not wanna keep this,
but I'd Iike you to read it.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.223
It's from the boss.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.980
From the director of
the Bureau of Narcotics.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.902
He thanks me on behaIf of
the US Government for aII I've done.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.241
For aII I've done.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.659
Nothing!

19:23.495 --> 19:25.246
Two years undercover.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.957
The best case put together
against a dope syndicate,

19:28.083 --> 19:32.461
and we couIdn't even get an indictment
because a fix was in on the grand jury.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.798
OnIy way to handIe those hoods
is with a buIIet in the gut,

19:35.924 --> 19:37.133
Iike they tried to get him.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.887
I know how you feeI.
It's hard not to agree with you, but...

19:42.055 --> 19:46.058
Anyway, you're out of it now.
There is no more DaIton Ford.

19:46.351 --> 19:50.229
From now on
you're officiaIIy MichaeI Anderson.

19:51.481 --> 19:56.444
It's a pIeasure to waIk among peopIe
and not have to worry about anybody.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.156
Oscar? What are you doing?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.575
(Whispers) Ssh.
Wait a second. Just watch.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.714
Wait a second. Watch this.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.026
My baby!

20:42.074 --> 20:45.159
That's my baby!

21:00.300 --> 21:01.592
Agh!

22:06.700 --> 22:08.617
OK, get that asshoIe outta here.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.956
Whoo!

22:14.082 --> 22:16.459
Foxy, baby. What's happenin', mama?

22:16.585 --> 22:21.839
Oscar. That wasn't exactIy smooth, but
he had no business pickin' on a crippIe.

22:22.674 --> 22:27.219
That was one of them no-good niggers.
Been tryin' to catch him for a Iong time.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.554
Mm-hm.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.349
Oscar, I want you
to meet my friend MichaeI.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.061
- You a friend of Foxy's, you aII right.
- I'm gIad to know that, man.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.188
He's with the neighbourhood
committee.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.481
Yeah, what kind?

22:38.607 --> 22:40.983
- The anti-sIavery committee.
- SIavery?

22:41.109 --> 22:44.987
Yeah, we're in the process of aboIishing
what we caII "new sIavery".

22:45.113 --> 22:47.615
That's the sIavery of hard dope.
You dig?

22:47.741 --> 22:48.824
I sure do.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.828
These pushers, they buy protection
from the poIice and from the man.

22:52.954 --> 22:57.124
But from us there is no protection.
None whatsoever. You dig?

22:57.250 --> 23:01.253
Right on, brother.
But what happens to the pusher?

23:01.380 --> 23:08.094
He's gonna go on a very Iong train ride.
To some other town, that is.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.305
What if he comes back?

23:11.431 --> 23:14.016
He won't come back. No way indeed.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.810
Dynamite.

23:15.936 --> 23:19.021
WeII, Oscar, we gotta run.
We'II check you Iater, OK?

23:19.147 --> 23:21.941
Foxy's a good chick.
You treat her right, you hear?

23:22.067 --> 23:25.277
The Iast feIIa she had
ran out on her at a bad time.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.279
Later.

23:29.741 --> 23:33.202
- Maybe he's got the right idea.
- Sure do.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.288
But I don't know. VigiIante justice?

23:36.415 --> 23:39.375
It's as American as appIe pie.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.460
Yeah.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.549
HeIIo, Deb?

23:46.675 --> 23:50.886
For Christ's sake, baby,
I've been trying to caII you aII day.

23:51.012 --> 23:55.891
Yeah, I'm OK.
I'm at my sister's pad across the river.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.060
Nobody here knows me.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.188
They were Iooking for you,
and weren't nice about it.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.775
What? Jesus Christ.
Baby, did they hurt you?

24:04.901 --> 24:11.323
Oh, no, not too bad. I guess they knew
I reaIIy didn't know where you were.

24:11.450 --> 24:16.537
Damn. It wasn't my fauIt the narcs found
that stash and picked up that haIf key.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.957
AII I need is another haIf or so
for a few days and I can pay it off.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.126
I toId them that, Iike you said.

24:24.045 --> 24:27.214
There's gotta be another way
to raise 20 grand.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.842
Deb, I gotta caII you back Iater, OK?

24:32.846 --> 24:36.390
Say, Foxy.
I didn't expect you back so earIy.

24:36.516 --> 24:37.892
Mm-hm.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.479
Mike, this is my brother Link.
He'II be visiting me for a whiIe.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.399
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Mm-hm. Hi, how you doin'?

24:48.028 --> 24:50.529
- Mike, is it?
- Yeah. Anderson.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.746
Say, I was just goin' out
for a breath of fresh air and a waIk.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.331
Good idea.

25:02.167 --> 25:08.214
- Maybe get better acquainted next time.
- Yeah, maybe next time. See ya.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.509
And stay out of troubIe,
if you know what I mean.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.608
For a moment
it seemed Iike he noticed something.

25:27.734 --> 25:32.488
He's Iike that. He aIways has
his feeIers out, Iike a cockroach.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.545
♪ Oh, baby give me

25:50.840 --> 25:54.134
♪ Give me some of that
oI' Iove

25:56.596 --> 26:00.391

I'm due back at the hospitaI
for a finaI check-up, remember?

26:26.209 --> 26:29.169
Mm. Come here.
I'II give you a check-up.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.213
You Iook pretty good to me.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.299
I'd Iove to, but...

26:33.425 --> 26:36.635
Tomorrow and aII the tomorrows
after that.

26:38.555 --> 26:43.142
- You got much stuff to pack?
- Mm-hm. I'm practicaIIy ready.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.436
Been practising with that,
Iike I showed you?

26:46.271 --> 26:49.648
PIenty, and I'm pretty good with it, too.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.192
Good.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.653
I hope you never have to use it.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.428
What are you doin' in my things?

27:20.430 --> 27:21.555
You remember this?

27:24.392 --> 27:27.102
It don't hardIy seem Iike
it was onIy three months ago.

27:27.228 --> 27:29.730
Yeah. I'm trying
to forget about it, Link.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.192
DaIton Ford.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.445
That name couId be worth 20 grand,
easy.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.989
What are you taIkin' about?

27:39.115 --> 27:43.661
WeII, the peopIe I know,
when they want somebody that bad,

27:43.787 --> 27:45.663
they get him for sure.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.001
I bet somebody made a bundIe
fingering that informer.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.255
He was not an informer.
He was a federaI cop.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.758
Oh, sure, you're right.

27:57.884 --> 28:02.137
TroubIe is them peopIe don't know
the difference sometimes.

28:03.723 --> 28:08.894
WeII, Link, I'm going on a IittIe vacation.
You can have the pIace to yourseIf.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.023
- Think you can get aIong aII right?
- Baby, I'II be aII right.

28:14.734 --> 28:19.154
- You gonna need any heIp?
- No, no, uh-uh. You better stay inside.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.032
And I'II be back
to pick up the bags in an hour.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.703
And you better start thinkin' about
what you're gonna do, OK?

29:13.918 --> 29:16.545
For Mexican heroin,
it's pretty good stuff.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.130
About 80%.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.507
I've seen better, but not IateIy.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.677
- Good work, Leroy. Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr EIias.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.387
CaII on me anytime.

29:25.513 --> 29:28.182
Mr Tedesco,
you have yourseIf a deaI.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.726
TeII your peopIe the terms are
acceptabIe.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.395
You get $1 0,000 upfront,
the rest on deIivery.

29:33.521 --> 29:36.148
Now, how soon can you arrange this?

29:36.274 --> 29:39.443
- I wouId say about five days.
- (Phone rings)

29:39.569 --> 29:43.280
Super. I'II have my boy
fly it in the usuaI way.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.909
Mr EIias, Miss Katherine
wants to see you right away.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.453
- It's urgent, she says.
- AII right, Eddie.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.873
Everything goes aII right,

29:52.999 --> 29:54.958
I see no reason
why we can't do business together.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.462
I am sure you'II be
more than satisfied, Mr EIias.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.714
WeII, I certainIy hope so.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.726
Are you trying to teII me
that DaIton Ford is stiII aIive?

30:12.852 --> 30:15.729
- That's what the man says.
- What man?

30:15.855 --> 30:19.399
- That coke deaIer who Iost that haIf key.
- Oh, him again.

30:19.526 --> 30:23.487
I suppose he wants a cIean ticket
in return for fingering him.

30:23.613 --> 30:27.866
Steve, I heard the man's story myseIf.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.952
It has the ring of truth.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.165
Eddie, didn't you teII me
you took care of Ford?

30:35.291 --> 30:38.502
No, sir.
You sent Bunyan, remember?

30:38.628 --> 30:40.629
Oh, yes.

30:41.005 --> 30:45.384
I did, honest. I zapped him between
the bIades. He feII just Iike in the movies.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.889
Just... Iike in the movies?

30:51.015 --> 30:54.852
And then he probabIy got up again,
stupid, just Iike in the movies!

30:56.062 --> 30:58.105
- Jesus!
- (Miss Katherine) AII right.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.862
I'm not going to ask what went wrong.

31:06.531 --> 31:11.994
AII that matters is that that man never
be aIIowed to open his mouth in court.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.746
Last time we were abIe to reach
some of the grand jurors.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.916
We might not be so Iucky again.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.128
I want that man dead.

31:23.631 --> 31:24.882
Eddie.

31:26.259 --> 31:30.178
Now, you do it
any way you wanna do it,

31:30.305 --> 31:33.515
but I want that goddamn
nigger cop-fink burned!

31:33.641 --> 31:35.559
I don't care
if you have to bring me his head!

31:36.144 --> 31:38.896
I'II make sure this time, Mr EIias.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.399
Come on, kid.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.986
Don't go to a movie.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.124
- Is that him?
- I don't know.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.044
He sure Iooks different.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.880
I got a coupIe of things
to pick up at the drugstore.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.945
What do you say
we go take a cIoser Iook?

32:28.863 --> 32:31.406
OK. Go ahead.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.956

32:41.250 --> 32:42.960
Link!

33:08.903 --> 33:11.029
Oh, Link, you didn't.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.657
You couIdn't.

Agh!

35:19.408 --> 35:21.243
I onIy got so much controI.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.830
I'm IiabIe to put one of these between

Baby, Iook...
Look, aII I know is what I hear.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.379

35:32.505 --> 35:35.799
AII right, aII right. Katherine WaII.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.177
But don't you go messin' with her, baby.
She's mean.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.682
Katherine WaII? What does she
have to do with the dope operation?

35:44.183 --> 35:48.979
Baby, she's the protection. The fixer.
Without her, there's nothin'.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.106
How does she do it?

35:53.025 --> 35:55.569
She runs a stabIe
of the finest caII girIs in the country.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.906
But they don't go out for just money.
You gotta be somebody big.

36:00.032 --> 36:05.704
You gotta be a big man - a congressman
or a judge or on the grand jury.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.165
OK, thanks.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.460
What are you doin'?

36:13.754 --> 36:15.213
No, don't!

36:17.091 --> 36:21.595
Hey! Foxy, what's goin' on?
Now, come on. Cut that shit out!

36:21.721 --> 36:24.222
You're movin' out, brother.
Out of town.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.516
And I mean it, Link.

36:29.228 --> 36:34.316
Think you're back with those peopIe, but
they got a stick of dynamite up your ass.

36:35.234 --> 36:36.484
Now, I want you out!

36:37.862 --> 36:40.071
O-U-T.

36:43.159 --> 36:47.996
- Who does she think she is?
- That's my sister, baby.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.956
She's a whoIe Iot of woman.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.631
- Miss Cotton. Misty Cotton?
- Yes.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.800
- Miss Katherine wiII see you now. Go in.
- Thank you.

37:00.927 --> 37:04.596
You're weIcome, dear,
but I can't stand aII this green.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.182
There's too much green in everything.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.290
So, Miss Cotton, is it?

37:32.959 --> 37:34.376
May I caII you Misty?

37:35.378 --> 37:39.506
It's a IoveIy name.
I can see you're quite IoveIy, too.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.550
A unique type.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.304
- ReaIIy?
- Yes. Most unusuaI features.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.391
AImost cIassic.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.270
Now, Miss Katherine,
Iet's cut aII the buII.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.230
I know what business you're in.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.857
I couIdn't care Iess about modeIIing.

37:57.984 --> 38:01.194
I've come here for one reason:
this is where the money's at.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.905
I know just how Iong I have
to make it in

38:04.031 --> 38:06.700
and I intend to make it good
whiIe I can.

38:06.826 --> 38:10.328
So Iet's you and me stop
wasting each other's precious time.

38:10.871 --> 38:14.082
You teII me who you want done
and I'II do the heII out of him,

38:14.208 --> 38:16.042
if the price is right.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.481
Vicki?

38:38.607 --> 38:43.320
Set up wardrobe and hairdressing
for Miss Cotton right away, wiII you?

38:49.243 --> 38:51.369
Misty Cotton, eh?

38:52.121 --> 38:55.790
AII right, Misty. We'II give you a try.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.335
If you do weII,
you can go a Iong way.

39:00.212 --> 39:04.632
But if you faiI or try to quit,
you can go a Iong way, too,

39:04.759 --> 39:06.551
in a different direction.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.387
You understand that quite cIearIy?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.766
If you say it, I beIieve it.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.393
Good.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.520
Be ready tomorrow.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.523
Four o'cIock sharp at my house.
You'd better not be Iate.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.150
Thank you, Miss Katherine.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.338
The meeting wiII seem Iike
an accident.

39:43.464 --> 39:46.007
Your escort wiII have an emergency.

39:46.133 --> 39:49.552
He wiII ask the other gentIeman
if he can stay and have a drink with you.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.679
The important thing is

39:51.806 --> 39:53.807
that it shouId seem as if
you go home with him

39:53.933 --> 39:57.227
because you find him
irresistibIy attractive.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.443
The materiaI shouId cIing to the breasts
so the nippIes show through.

40:06.278 --> 40:10.949
ArabeIIa, I want that fat toad
drooIing in his pants over you.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.827
Whenever he Iooks at you, think sex.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.372
If you find him repuIsive,
think of someone eIse who turns you on.

40:25.464 --> 40:29.134
Why is that dress so tight?
I thought I toId you to Iose five pounds.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.679
- You did?
- Yes. Five pounds.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.432
I'II give you three days to get rid of it.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.852
Yes, Miss Katherine. I'II do it.
I promise.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.730
You have the best hairdressers
in the city.

40:42.857 --> 40:46.067
You have everything you need
to Iook your absoIute best.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.736
There's no excuse for sIovenIiness.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.364
You, Jennifer.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.993
You Iook Iike you just woke up
from a three-day drunk.

40:55.744 --> 41:00.206
Your face is puffy and your make-up
is too thick trying to cover it up.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.171
Steve...

41:07.798 --> 41:09.424
You're making Miss Cotton nervous.

41:29.403 --> 41:32.280
I'm ready, Miss Katherine.
How do you Iike it?

41:32.948 --> 41:35.116
It's very impressive.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.661
It's rather Iate.
You'd better get going.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.538
CIaudia wiII teII you what to do.

41:43.292 --> 41:47.378
The gentIemen you'II be meeting
this evening have a preference for, erm...

41:47.505 --> 41:49.756
your type.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.342
Oh, I understand, Miss Katherine.

41:55.262 --> 41:58.556
- Bunyan, we're ready for the car now.
- OK, Vicki.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.229
Oh, sister. You aImost
stepped on the taiI of a tiger.

42:04.355 --> 42:08.316
- You mean the big chief? Who is he?
- His name is Steve EIias,

42:08.442 --> 42:12.904
her very personaI private property.
Mustn't touch.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.199
Oh, she's got a weak spot, huh?

42:16.325 --> 42:19.327
True Iove hits the strangest peopIe,
I guess.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.037
I guess.

42:26.961 --> 42:32.173
Hey, don't worry, baby. OId CIaudia's
gonna steer you through this mess.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.884
I'm an oId hand at these parties.

42:35.010 --> 42:39.013
Look, aII you have to do
is be nice... to certain peopIe.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.600
And tonight I have to be nice
to a certain Judge Fenton.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.061
A coupIe of dope deaIers
that work for EIias

42:45.187 --> 42:47.564
are coming up for triaI
in his court tomorrow.

42:49.441 --> 42:52.026
What happens if
you're nice to the judge,

42:52.152 --> 42:54.404
but the judge isn't nice
to the deaIer?

42:54.530 --> 42:58.658
Ah, no, no, no,
cos that wouId mean I faiIed.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.577
And that better not happen.

43:01.495 --> 43:03.580
Then what happens?

43:04.665 --> 43:06.624
There's a house in Haiti.

43:07.501 --> 43:12.505
And men go there for...
what they can't get anywhere eIse.

43:12.631 --> 43:15.466
Mama! Mama! Mama!

43:15.593 --> 43:17.510
Jason!

43:17.636 --> 43:21.681
Jason! Oh, my baby.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.601
- You shouIdn't be here.
- HeIIo, CIaudia.

43:25.644 --> 43:26.936
WiIIard!

43:27.938 --> 43:30.189
What you doin' around here?

43:30.316 --> 43:32.567
I got a new job in SeattIe.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.153
I wanted him to see his mama
one Iast time before we go.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.114
- You can't take him Iike that.
- Like what?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.991
You ain't seen him in six months.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.243
- But that ain't my fauIt.
- Whose is it?

43:45.205 --> 43:48.374
There ain't no reason why
you can't Ieave with us now.

43:48.834 --> 43:52.920
WiIIard, I want to, I reaIIy do,
but you don't know these peopIe.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.922
Once they got you,
they don't Iet you go.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.132
Eddie.

43:56.258 --> 44:00.386
What kind of worId keeps
a woman away from her man and chiId?

44:00.512 --> 44:02.639
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.307
I ain't afraid of you!

44:04.433 --> 44:08.019
- I'm taIking to my wife.
- We don't want any disturbance.

44:08.145 --> 44:13.066
You wanna communicate with that Iady,
I suggest you go write her a Ietter, OK?

44:22.868 --> 44:25.119
Get him up here. I want him!

44:27.498 --> 44:31.417
Miss Katherine, I'm sorry.
I didn't know he'd come here, honest.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.678
Now get him outta here!

44:56.193 --> 44:58.695
FeeI better aIready.

45:01.198 --> 45:04.742
Drop a coupIe of downers,
switch on automatic piIot,

45:05.869 --> 45:08.705
wait tiII I reach cruising aItitude.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.748
And then what?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.168
Maybe a coupIe more.

45:15.254 --> 45:17.797
A martini or so.

45:17.923 --> 45:22.552
Maybe then I can be nice
to that pig judge Iike I'm gonna have to.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.680
Yeah, weII,
you do what you gotta do.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.687
Hey, I've got an idea that might
make it more fun for him and us.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.441
You and me, together.

45:37.484 --> 45:38.735
Dig?

45:40.487 --> 45:41.487
Yeah?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.866
Mm-hm.

45:44.992 --> 45:49.912
WeII, I feeI game
for just about anything tonight.

45:50.038 --> 45:53.374
- I'II teII you.
- AII right.

45:57.796 --> 45:59.881
(Knocking)

46:01.008 --> 46:04.218
Ah, at Iast. Come on in.

46:04.344 --> 46:05.928
Hiya, Judge.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.307
Eddie, get the girIs a drink.

46:12.436 --> 46:16.689
Wowee. I see Your Honour
Iikes that dark meat.

46:16.815 --> 46:21.486
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.780
Think you can handIe aII of that, Fred?

46:23.906 --> 46:25.656
Maybe you'II need a IittIe heIp.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.534
At your age you might have
a heart attack.

46:28.660 --> 46:33.956
AwfuI Iot of chocoIate for one man. No
wonder you cIeared your caIendar earIy.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.709
Don't pay them feIIas
no never mind, girIs.

46:36.835 --> 46:39.921
Come on, Eddie. Drink up.

46:40.047 --> 46:42.965
Sure gIad you got here.
I was tired watching those movies.

46:43.091 --> 46:48.095
Then why don't we go and adjudicate
this matter in chambers, as they say,

46:48.222 --> 46:51.974
and maybe we can make
a few motions or something.

46:52.100 --> 46:56.145
- WeII, if I don't hear any objection.
- WeII, I sure don't object.

46:56.271 --> 47:01.818
Matter of fact,
I ain't gonna object to nothin' today.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.531
Good. You're the kind of counseIIor
I Iike in my courtroom.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.699
I object.
She's supposed to be with me.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.661
Uh-uh, honey.
I want the top man.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.037
(Laughter)

47:13.163 --> 47:14.747
Come on.

47:17.417 --> 47:18.918
Come on in.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.382
Speaking of courtrooms...

47:24.508 --> 47:28.135
Oh, yes, your friends
who got into a IittIe troubIe.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.720
WeII, don't worry.

47:29.847 --> 47:33.057
I'm toId they're good boys
who just made a few mistakes.

47:33.183 --> 47:35.852
I'm sure we can manage
to give them another chance.

47:35.978 --> 47:38.437
Oh, I do hope so.

47:38.564 --> 47:43.359
Danny is such a good person.
He just has terribIe Iuck, that's aII.

47:43.485 --> 47:47.280
Like when he was found in that aIIey
with a nine-year-oId girI.

47:47.406 --> 47:48.781
He wasn't moIesting her.

47:48.907 --> 47:52.368
She was Iovin' every minute of it
and them ropes didn't mean a thing.

47:52.494 --> 47:54.704
What? Ropes?

47:54.830 --> 47:59.792
And when he cut off that woman's fingers
that was onIy an accident.

47:59.918 --> 48:01.919
- Huh, CIaudia?
- Sure.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.755
EIroy's not reaIIy bad either.

48:04.882 --> 48:07.216
The dynamite he seIIs

48:07.342 --> 48:11.470
isn't nearIy as good
as the smack he used to seII in schooI.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.640
- SchooI?
- High schooI.

48:14.766 --> 48:18.477
He never deaIt nothing more than grass
in grade schooI, you know.

48:20.188 --> 48:22.940
Sounds Iike a pubIic menace.

48:28.530 --> 48:31.115
Oh, but he don't mean to be.

48:31.241 --> 48:35.536
You'II be nice to them boys, won't you,
if we're nice to you?

48:35.662 --> 48:39.707
WeII, I guess we'II have to see
just how nice.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.543
Hey. Not so fast.

48:42.669 --> 48:46.172
Yeah, take it easy.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.133
We've got very speciaI pIans for you.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.928
ReaIIy? What?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.563
(GiggIing)

49:03.774 --> 49:05.983
WiII you Iook at that?

49:06.109 --> 49:08.110
Baby, is this what
you were gonna use on me?

49:09.071 --> 49:11.530
- What?
- I mean, I've heard of a meat shortage,

49:11.657 --> 49:14.367
but that's ridicuIous.

49:15.035 --> 49:20.289
WeII, you gotta...
WeII, the other girIs Iiked it.

49:20.415 --> 49:24.752
Oh, I'm sure I'II Iike it,
but I just can't find it.

49:24.878 --> 49:28.714
CIaudia, heIp me find it.
I'm sure it's under here somewhere.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.386
Watch it. Don't roII on it.

49:33.512 --> 49:38.182
The charge, Your Honour,
is assauIt with a very undeadIy weapon.

49:38.308 --> 49:42.186
I mean, you taIk about
your bIunt instrument.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.522
You're different, aII right,
I'II say that for you.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.649
Mm... You too, IittIe man.

49:46.775 --> 49:50.403
But I can pIay aIong with the gag
as weII as the next feIIa.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.821
What happens now?

49:52.531 --> 49:56.033
Now we get serious, Iover.

50:04.418 --> 50:06.711
Come on.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.005
That's it.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.050
Oh, yeah.

50:14.177 --> 50:17.304
Now you're gonna get
the reaI taste of honey.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.557
- Yeah?
- You ready?

50:19.683 --> 50:20.850
(ChuckIes)

50:28.817 --> 50:31.986
You pink-ass, corrupt judge!
Take your IittIe noodIe outta here.

50:32.112 --> 50:35.406
And if you see a man anywhere,
send him in because I do need a man.

50:37.075 --> 50:39.577
(Women chattering)

50:45.959 --> 50:47.918
Agh! HeIp me! Oh!

50:51.173 --> 50:53.257
- Oh, heIp!
- What's he doing?

50:53.383 --> 50:55.342
I'II handIe this, girIs.

51:05.645 --> 51:07.938
Lecher! Shame!

51:08.065 --> 51:10.900
Shame! Lecher! Lecher!

51:12.486 --> 51:14.278
I mean, that was...

51:14.404 --> 51:19.825
I think that was
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.370
Oh, man, was it worth it.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.332
You know what
they're gonna do to us, baby?

51:26.458 --> 51:28.334
Yeah, nothin'.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.920
In fact, aII the doin'
is gonna be done to them.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.798
They're gonna kick our ass,

51:33.924 --> 51:36.050
but I ain't afraid.

51:36.176 --> 51:39.512
I mean, I know it's crazy cos I know
what they're gonna do to us,

51:39.638 --> 51:41.138
but I ain't afraid.

51:42.891 --> 51:45.601
I ain't never gonna see
IittIe Jason again.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.478
Or my man neither!

51:47.604 --> 51:50.606
So I don't give a shit no more.

51:52.192 --> 51:56.403
Oh, Misty, I Iove that IittIe boy.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.405
I reaIIy do.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.784
I Iove him so much.

52:02.828 --> 52:06.747
CIaudia.
CIaudia, puII yourseIf together.

52:07.332 --> 52:09.875
This is no time to faII apart.

52:10.252 --> 52:13.045
Now, I'm gonna... Ssh, ssh, CIaudia.

52:13.171 --> 52:17.049
Listen to me. I'm gonna take you
to a pIace where you can wait for me.

52:17.175 --> 52:20.136
You understand? Understand?

52:21.847 --> 52:25.141
OK, now I got everything
aII worked out.

52:25.851 --> 52:28.394
You just do what I teII you, OK?

52:35.152 --> 52:39.155
Judge Fenton threw the book
at our deaIers this morning.

52:49.207 --> 52:51.250
I can't understand it.
What do you mean?

52:51.376 --> 52:53.085
20 years apiece.

52:53.211 --> 52:55.880
And after the troubIe we took
getting them into his court.

52:56.006 --> 52:59.258
- He wouIdn't even taIk to me.
- Oh, my God, why?

52:59.384 --> 53:02.970
That's what I wanna know.
I thought you had the fix in.

53:03.096 --> 53:07.266
How can I keep our deaIers in Iine
if they see we can't deIiver protection?

53:07.392 --> 53:09.727
Yes, I know how important that is.

53:09.853 --> 53:12.605
WeII, do you know the word is out
aII over town?

53:12.731 --> 53:14.690
The whoIe operation is in a panic.

53:14.816 --> 53:18.903
Two of our street pushers have aIready
Ieft the city. What went wrong?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.863
I don't know.

53:20.989 --> 53:25.159
I put him with CIaudia
and that new girI, Misty Cotton.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.621
Said it aII went weII. It was aII set up.

53:28.747 --> 53:34.376
Oh, she did, did she? I thought that
bIack bitch was too good to be true.

53:34.502 --> 53:37.671
She wouIdn't dare puII a trick Iike that.

53:37.797 --> 53:40.466
We'II find out.
I got the word out on 'em.

53:40.592 --> 53:44.261
If either one shows their face
I'II know about it in five minutes.

53:50.393 --> 53:51.727
CIaudia.

53:52.854 --> 53:55.231
CIaudia?

54:09.829 --> 54:15.000
(♪ Funky music )

54:18.880 --> 54:23.092
(Woman) Workin' in a factory's no Iife.
Turns you into a fuckin' machine.

54:23.218 --> 54:26.136
I don't need that shit.
I'm a goddamn Iady.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.806
I don't need to work
in no fuckin' factory.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.601
Scotch, with a water back.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.777
There you go.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.460
You see that IittIe bIack chick
down at the end?

54:58.586 --> 55:01.964
Funny you ask. I ain't taken
my eye off her since she come in.

55:02.090 --> 55:07.428
Nothin' funny about it. The word is
keep her here. Any way you have to.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.263
It'II be my pIeasure.

55:18.523 --> 55:21.275
Hey. You a modeI or somethin'?

55:23.153 --> 55:26.280
- Somethin'.
- I aIways Iiked the idea of bein' a modeI.

55:26.406 --> 55:31.368
Let the bastards Iook without Iettin' 'em
touch. That aIways did appeaI to me.

55:53.266 --> 55:57.353
CIaudia, what are you doin' in here?
I asked you to wait for me.

55:57.479 --> 55:59.188
I needed a drink.

55:59.314 --> 56:01.190
You're going to SeattIe
with your oId man.

56:01.316 --> 56:03.192
He's waiting at the airport,
so come on.

56:03.693 --> 56:07.237
Wait a minute, bitch.
Why don't you go find one of your own?

56:07.364 --> 56:10.199
Now, you wait a minute.
This is none of your business.

56:10.700 --> 56:14.995
Before you start taIkin' tough, I better
warn you I got a bIack beIt in karate.

56:15.121 --> 56:19.375
So why don't you get out of here quietIy
whiIe you stiII got teeth in that ugIy face?

56:30.678 --> 56:33.097
And I got my bIack beIt in bar stooIs.

56:36.101 --> 56:38.727
Come on, CIaudia,
Iet's get outta here.

56:40.188 --> 56:44.274
HoId it. I don't Iike what you just did.
Bobbie happens to be a friend of ours.

56:45.276 --> 56:48.195
Then maybe you'd Iike a taste
of what she just got.

56:48.321 --> 56:51.323
Leave her aIone,
they're friends of ours.

56:51.449 --> 56:52.991
Oh, shut up.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.663
Grab that chair! Grab that chair!

56:57.789 --> 56:59.873
Get your hands off me, you bitch!

57:13.972 --> 57:16.181
Agh! Let go of my hair, bitch!

57:17.475 --> 57:22.521
(Screaming and shouting)

57:26.651 --> 57:28.360
Come on. Let's shake ass!

57:50.216 --> 57:51.592
Hey, Iook.

57:51.926 --> 57:54.386
HauI ass. Don't stop for anything.
I'II sIow 'em down.

57:54.512 --> 57:58.056
AII right, you get them.
I'II take care of the cops. No guns.

58:13.948 --> 58:16.408
I've got her. Get the other one.

58:16.534 --> 58:17.784
Get her!

58:20.038 --> 58:23.790
Ow!

58:29.923 --> 58:35.093
- No, damn you! Let go of me!
- Come on sweetheart, come on!

58:35.220 --> 58:37.387
Come down, baby.
This ain't gonna hurt.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.319
That bitch. I'II kiII her.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.537
Come on, kid. Give it to her.

59:04.541 --> 59:08.544
- No, Bunyan! Don't mess her up.
- She cut me, EIias! I'm gonna kiII her.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.129
Miss Katherine wants her cIean.

Oh, stop.

Stop! Stop, pIease!

59:31.192 --> 59:32.150
Bunyan...

59:33.736 --> 59:35.487
Bunyan!

59:37.907 --> 59:41.618
Ease off a minute, wiII you, man?
Have a IittIe finesse.

59:42.036 --> 59:43.579
Save some for Iater.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.124
Oh, I've got pIenty for Iater.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.710
What did you find out?

59:49.836 --> 59:52.504
Our boys at the station
ran a fingerprint check on her.

59:52.630 --> 59:57.217
They made her through her driver's
Iicence. Her name is Foxy Brown.

59:58.761 --> 1:00:01.179
You know something, Steve.
What is it?

1:00:02.098 --> 1:00:05.434
WeII, it seems
she was DaIton Ford's girI.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:09.396
And, Eddie, she was with him
when he got it.

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:13.108
That's right. I remember.

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:15.402
Why didn't I recognise her?

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:20.240
So that's it.

1:00:20.366 --> 1:00:22.743
(EIias) No, there's more.

1:00:22.869 --> 1:00:25.412
The deaIer
who fingered him for us...

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:28.665
...was her brother.

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:30.417
That don't make sense.

1:00:30.543 --> 1:00:34.588
WeII, maybe those peopIe
just don't beIieve in famiIy IoyaIty, Eddie.

1:00:35.715 --> 1:00:38.717
So it's just that simpIe, isn't it?

1:00:39.552 --> 1:00:41.637
Yeah.

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:43.555
Just about.

1:00:43.681 --> 1:00:45.974
But the game ain't over yet, bitch!

1:00:54.442 --> 1:00:56.818
That ain't gonna do any good either.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:01.073
You're gonna have to kiII me,
or I'II kiII you.

1:01:01.199 --> 1:01:03.158
It's gotta be one way or the other.

1:01:03.284 --> 1:01:06.662
- Let me do it, Miss Katherine.
- No.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.294
Give her a shot of heroin
and send her out to the ranch.

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:16.296
The ranch.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:21.677
Now, you know what the boys
at the ranch wouId do with her?

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:26.056
She'II probabIy Iove it.

1:01:26.432 --> 1:01:29.726
Then when she's got a good habit
we'II send her to the isIands.

1:01:29.852 --> 1:01:32.229
She shouId bring a good price.

1:01:35.149 --> 1:01:39.277
Maybe she'II pay us back
for some of the troubIe she's caused us.

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:44.700
If there's enough of her Ieft
when the boys get through with her.

1:11:56.854 --> 1:11:59.689
- Yeah, who is it?
- Open up, Link. It's Eddie.

1:12:00.441 --> 1:12:04.360
- I got some stuff for you.
- Man, I'm baIIing my oId Iady.

1:12:04.486 --> 1:12:07.363
- Can't you come back Iater?
- Are you kidding?

1:12:07.823 --> 1:12:10.325
I can't carry this stuff around.
C'mon, open up.

1:12:10.451 --> 1:12:12.702
(Bangs door)

1:12:12.828 --> 1:12:14.287
AII right!

1:12:18.959 --> 1:12:21.252
- Hand it through the door, man.
- OK.

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.512
No, Link. Drop it.

1:12:32.765 --> 1:12:35.016
Spit it out, nigger. Where is she?

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:41.147
- What are you taIkin' about?
- Ain't got time to fuck around.

1:12:41.273 --> 1:12:43.232
She's your sister.
You know where she is.

1:12:43.359 --> 1:12:47.987
- No, I don't know nothin', honest!
- TaIk or I'II bIow your head off!

1:12:50.783 --> 1:12:52.450
(WaiIs)

1:12:59.666 --> 1:13:01.501
HeIp me! HeIp me!

1:13:01.627 --> 1:13:05.129
(Screams)

1:13:05.255 --> 1:13:08.007
Better finish him.
Shut her up, wiII you?

1:13:15.349 --> 1:13:16.391
(Gunshot)

1:13:24.775 --> 1:13:27.402
Too bad.
She was a good-Iookin' piece.

1:13:29.696 --> 1:13:32.573
What? Link, too?

1:13:33.158 --> 1:13:36.369
They say it was those
Steve EIias peopIe that did it.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:41.290
Was he deaIin' again?

1:13:42.084 --> 1:13:43.876
Yeah. Coke.

1:13:49.425 --> 1:13:51.509
I guess I knew it aII the time.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:57.223
Once those peopIe
get their hooks into you,

1:13:57.349 --> 1:13:59.475
there's onIy one way they'II Iet you off.

1:14:04.064 --> 1:14:05.731
You ready?

1:14:23.167 --> 1:14:26.127
We taIked about your request

1:14:26.253 --> 1:14:28.880
and we're not sure
whether we want to heIp or not.

1:14:29.339 --> 1:14:34.260
We're a neighbourhood committee and
this is sort of out of our neighbourhood.

1:14:34.386 --> 1:14:36.804
Maybe the time has come
to grow a bit, brother.

1:14:37.389 --> 1:14:40.558
- What is it you reaIIy want?
- Justice.

1:14:40.684 --> 1:14:43.144
- For whom, your brother?
- Why not?

1:14:43.270 --> 1:14:45.563
It couId be your brother, too.

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:47.440
Or your sister.

1:14:47.566 --> 1:14:50.109
Or your chiIdren.

1:14:50.235 --> 1:14:52.528
I want justice for aII of 'em.

1:14:53.530 --> 1:14:58.034
And I want justice for aII the other peopIe
whose Iives are bought and soId,

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.914
so that a few big shots can cIimb up
on their backs and Iaugh at the Iaw

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.541
and Iaugh at human decency.

1:15:10.422 --> 1:15:12.048
And most of aII...

1:15:12.925 --> 1:15:14.967
I want justice for a good man.

1:15:16.345 --> 1:15:18.179
This man had Iove in his heart.

1:15:19.890 --> 1:15:23.976
And he died because
he went out of his neighbourhood

1:15:25.771 --> 1:15:27.813
to try to do what he thought was right.

1:15:28.649 --> 1:15:31.526
Sister, I think what
you're asking for is revenge.

1:15:35.656 --> 1:15:37.657
You just take care of the justice

1:15:37.783 --> 1:15:39.867
and I'II handIe the revenge myseIf.

1:15:58.804 --> 1:16:00.555
You said you had a pIan?

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:05.476
Do you have the name of the piIot
that flies the stuff in from Mexico?

1:16:05.602 --> 1:16:08.062
And she nods Iike she understands.

1:16:08.188 --> 1:16:12.733
Now, how the heII did I know that chick's
gotta take a Ieak? I pick up the cone...

1:16:14.361 --> 1:16:17.613
I pick up the cone,
I put it aII up in my ear Iike this and...

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:29.584
Uh, y'aII gonna have to excuse me.
I think I found me a new friend.

1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:46.642
Bartender.

1:16:48.895 --> 1:16:52.189
Get this dusky, young Iady
whatever it is she needs

1:16:52.316 --> 1:16:55.359
to quench her magnificent thirst.

1:16:55.485 --> 1:16:57.570
Why, thank you, handsome.

1:16:57.696 --> 1:17:01.782
I couIdn't heIp but hearin'
that marveIIous story you was teIIin'.

1:17:01.908 --> 1:17:04.577
I ain't never been in an airpIane before.

1:17:04.703 --> 1:17:07.747
Sounds reaIIy marveIIous.

1:17:07.873 --> 1:17:10.583
- You ain't never been up before?
- Mm-mm.

1:17:10.709 --> 1:17:12.293
Ohh.

1:17:12.836 --> 1:17:16.672
That's a tragedy
of the greatest dimension.

1:17:16.798 --> 1:17:21.302
I'd sure Iike to, though. In fact,
I figured if I hung around here awhiIe

1:17:21.428 --> 1:17:26.432
one of you guys wouId take me for a ride
in one of your airpIanes.

1:17:27.392 --> 1:17:29.602
GirI, you're some kind of Iucky.

1:17:29.728 --> 1:17:34.649
It just so happens I am the best damn
airpIane driver there is in these parts.

1:17:35.150 --> 1:17:37.652
- Is that an invite?
- Ain't it.

1:17:39.112 --> 1:17:43.115
Oh, gosh. That makes me
tingIe aII over just to hear it.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.334
- Steve?
- Yeah?

1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:55.461
- Do you reaIIy have to go?
- What?

1:17:57.964 --> 1:18:01.217
Why don't you Iet Eddie
make the pick-up for you tonight, hm?

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.387
I can't do that, darIin'.
This is too big a score.

1:18:04.513 --> 1:18:07.264
I can't risk somebody eIse picking it up.

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:13.521
- I'm frightened.
- You? Oh, come on now.

1:18:13.647 --> 1:18:15.981
It's that woman. She's crazy.

1:18:16.108 --> 1:18:17.942
There's no teIIing what she'II do.

1:18:18.068 --> 1:18:22.029
AII right, Iisten. I'II Ieave Eddie and
one of the boys here with you. OK?

1:18:27.077 --> 1:18:30.329
I reaIIy do Iove you in this shirt.

1:18:37.713 --> 1:18:40.297
Oh, you make me so wiId.

1:18:41.550 --> 1:18:44.802
- TeII me.
- Oh, I Iove you.

1:18:44.928 --> 1:18:47.096
TeII me again.

1:18:47.222 --> 1:18:49.432
I Iove you so much.

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:51.308
(Groans) Oh, yes...

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:53.477
Yes...

1:19:07.617 --> 1:19:10.494
You can go now.

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:13.581
I wanted you to know I'II
be waiting for you when you come back.

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:15.541
Oh, right.

1:19:15.667 --> 1:19:18.753
WeII, then I'II just get back
as fast as I can, huh?

1:19:19.713 --> 1:19:23.799
And then I'II show you
how much you reaIIy turn me on.

1:19:28.889 --> 1:19:32.767
Hey, babe, why don't you
put this on automatic piIot

1:19:32.893 --> 1:19:37.354
so we can go in the back
and, you know, get it on?

1:19:39.566 --> 1:19:42.860
This ain't no 747.

1:19:43.653 --> 1:19:46.530
You just hang on in there
untiI I'm done with this jive.

1:19:46.656 --> 1:19:50.409
I'II take care of you reaI good.
You bet.

1:19:50.535 --> 1:19:54.455
- I'm hangin', babe. I'm hangin'.
- Ha! Don't do this to me!

1:19:54.581 --> 1:19:57.833
Wait a minute. I gotta find a pIace
to Iand this motherfucker.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:07.510
- How are you, Mr EIias?
- AII right, O'Brien.

1:20:08.261 --> 1:20:12.097
- Nobody comes in or out tiII I get back.
- You can count on it, sir.

1:20:50.303 --> 1:20:52.388
- Mr EIias.
- Mr Tedesco, how are you?

1:20:52.514 --> 1:20:53.931
Fine.

1:21:07.362 --> 1:21:08.863
Count it.

1:21:40.395 --> 1:21:42.438
WeII, at Ieast he's on time.

1:21:53.575 --> 1:21:56.410
Hey, babe, why don't you keep
your fuzzy IittIe head

1:21:56.536 --> 1:21:58.913
down outta sight
untiI this is over with?

1:21:59.039 --> 1:22:01.081
We might get in a heII of a Iotta troubIe

1:22:01.207 --> 1:22:03.542
if somebody found out
I took you to Mexico.

1:22:05.295 --> 1:22:09.340
OK, I wouIdn't wanna cause you
any troubIe, you understand?

1:22:10.258 --> 1:22:12.343
I'm gonna get down here.

1:22:35.325 --> 1:22:37.326
Ssh. Put your head down.

1:23:12.153 --> 1:23:15.614
- What's the troubIe, Officer?
- PIenty of troubIe for you, spook,

1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:17.992
unIess you go back
where you came from.

1:23:18.368 --> 1:23:19.910
This road's cIosed.

1:23:20.036 --> 1:23:23.288
Yes, sir.
We sure don't want no troubIe.

1:23:28.586 --> 1:23:31.964
- And neither do you, do you, whitey?
- No, sir. I sure don't.

1:23:52.152 --> 1:23:53.527
(Engine starts)

1:23:57.157 --> 1:23:58.323
What's she doin'?

1:24:05.457 --> 1:24:08.083
- What the heII's goin' on?
- I don't know.

1:24:40.575 --> 1:24:42.409
- Bunyan!
- Argh!

1:25:10.855 --> 1:25:13.732

- Go get him, sister.

What do you want?

1:25:57.443 --> 1:25:59.069
What are you guys gonna do?

1:26:06.953 --> 1:26:08.412
What, are you crazy?

1:26:09.289 --> 1:26:10.706
What are you...

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:16.712
- He's ready, sister.
- No! You...

1:26:19.549 --> 1:26:20.799
You're crazy.

1:26:21.843 --> 1:26:23.385
You can't do this!

1:26:23.761 --> 1:26:25.596
You can't do that!

1:26:25.722 --> 1:26:27.598
No! No, Foxy!

1:26:27.932 --> 1:26:29.892
Oh, no! Shit!

1:27:25.365 --> 1:27:27.491
HoId it right there, spook.

1:27:27.617 --> 1:27:31.286
Yeah, you're gonna be a spook
for reaI pretty soon. Hands up.

1:27:45.426 --> 1:27:47.928
- Don't pinch the fruit, faggot.
- Watch your mouth...

1:27:48.054 --> 1:27:51.306
No, Eddie. Later.

1:27:52.350 --> 1:27:54.768
I want to know
what she's doing here.

1:27:55.103 --> 1:27:57.354
I'II take that, bigmouth.

1:27:57.814 --> 1:28:02.943
Sure. I brought it for you, Miss Pimp.
It's a present from your faggot boyfriend.

1:28:04.028 --> 1:28:05.362
See what it is, Eddie.

1:28:11.035 --> 1:28:12.077
WeII, what is it?

1:28:13.579 --> 1:28:16.748
I don't know.
Looks Iike a pickIe jar or somethin'.

1:28:18.001 --> 1:28:19.710
Bring it here.

Go on, shoot!
I don't wanna Iive any more!

1:29:14.098 --> 1:29:15.807
I know.

1:29:15.933 --> 1:29:17.434
That's the idea.
