MARTY: Well, your understanding is
limited and that doesn't surprise me.

13:20.644 --> 13:24.513
The fact of the matter is
the entire case was thrown out

13:24.514 --> 13:26.415
because the evidence was insufficient,

13:26.416 --> 13:29.119
it was illegally obtained and
it was totally fabricated.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.754
This entire thing is a railroad job

13:31.755 --> 13:34.323
perpetrated by a small
group of individuals

13:34.324 --> 13:36.525
who would rather see me behind bars

13:36.526 --> 13:41.131
than standing in court against
them, defending my clients.

13:41.264 --> 13:42.866
Like you defended Talia?

13:45.068 --> 13:47.170
Talia Freeman's death was a tragedy.

13:48.839 --> 13:50.140
Her life... (CLEARS THROAT)

13:50.774 --> 13:52.676
Was very difficult, she had a very

troubled life, a very troubled

13:56.413 --> 13:59.115
past and a very troubled present

13:59.716 --> 14:02.218
and she was involved with some
not very pleasant people

14:02.219 --> 14:04.955
and very sadly that caught up with her.

14:05.455 --> 14:07.215
Are you saying you know who killed her?

14:07.924 --> 14:11.628
I'm saying that I am deeply,

14:11.762 --> 14:16.766
deeply saddened and
very sorry for her passing.

difficult for you.

sometimes painful.

14:46.463 --> 14:47.930
Gonna be a tough act
to follow up there.

Oh, come on, you've always
been a good actor.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.267

now, didn't it?

14:51.268 --> 14:53.403
That you did. Remind me,
why did I let you go?

14:54.104 --> 14:55.438
Couldn't afford me anymore?

14:55.972 --> 14:57.841
Didn't like being
a hatchet man anymore.

14:59.676 --> 15:01.244
I'm still a hatchet man.

15:01.745 --> 15:03.680

onto bigger trees.

don't have anything that I want.

ETHAN: Mmm-hmm.

26:45.014 --> 26:46.882
That doesn't really make sense.
I mean, he's an accountant.

No, he's an actuary.

26:50.486 --> 26:53.855
Oh, I'm sorry, my mistake. He's an actuary.
That is why he was trying to kill us.

26:53.856 --> 26:56.659
No, he wasn't trying to kill
us, he was trying to kill you.

I mean, really, Ethan,

27:08.171 --> 27:09.237
what is your angle here?

27:09.238 --> 27:11.439
That Gary finished up his spreadsheets

27:11.440 --> 27:13.208

over here to blow me away?

don't know what to think.

27:17.246 --> 27:19.949
Okay. Search Parker Hershorn.

27:20.917 --> 27:23.452

someone in the HR department.

30:05.548 --> 30:07.148
myself and Miss Gorbachov

30:07.149 --> 30:09.652

to Gaffney this afternoon.
- What?

43:21.910 --> 43:23.911
Yeah. The partners think
the blowback's gonna be bad

43:23.912 --> 43:25.180
