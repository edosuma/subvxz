YOUR MIND WORKS.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.600

13:47.300 --> 13:49.800
OTHERWISE HE COULD FREEZE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS CONCERT,

13:49.800 --> 13:52.600

FOR RUINING HIS CAREER!

13:52.600 --> 13:54.400

A CAREER.

THEN I'LL ASK FOR
HIS PANTS AS A REWARD.

IN JAIL.

I'M GONNA SAY BLUE.
IS THAT OK?

21:50.100 --> 21:53.133
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR FAVORITE
COLOR IS.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.867
I JUST WANNA
MARRY YOU.

21:55.867 --> 21:58.467
IT'S NOT BROWN,
