WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:07.050
I thought that you were
a task force liaison

00:07.050 --> 00:08.095
I'm supposed to be
meeting with.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.270
I am.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.923
An anti-government organization

00:10.923 --> 00:14.623
may be planning infrastructure
attacks right here in Chicago.

00:14.623 --> 00:18.627
<i>Kylie Estevez officially
passed the firefighter's test.</i>

00:18.627 --> 00:21.847
It's not the final step,
but it's a big one.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.023
I really miss him.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.720
I just hope that
there's not something

00:24.720 --> 00:26.417
more serious going on.

00:26.417 --> 00:29.507
Severide wrapped up
this thing in Alabama

00:29.507 --> 00:32.032
and now he's on some
ATF investigation.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.859
What are you talking about?

00:33.859 --> 00:36.949
<i>What I want is
to adopt Amber's baby.</i>

00:36.949 --> 00:38.647
That's pretty big news.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.344
And now that you know that,
you can start

00:40.344 --> 00:42.651
figuring out
how to make that happen.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.828
Amber, hi.

00:45.828 --> 00:48.091
What are you doing here?

00:48.091 --> 00:50.137
I know that's a lot to ask.

00:52.269 --> 00:55.925
I left all that behind
in Chicago.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.667
I'm starting over here, okay?

00:58.667 --> 01:00.930
I get that. I do.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.193
But your own instinct
was that I'm the right person

01:03.193 --> 01:05.108
to care for that little girl.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.110
And that's exactly
what I wanna do.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.330
I promise that's all I want.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.637
What would I have to do?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.378
You'd reclaim custody
of the baby.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.424
She's in a foster home now.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.990
Then you can designate
me her legal guardian,

01:17.990 --> 01:19.296
and eventually,
adoptive mother.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.950
Eventually?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.560
How long does all this take?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.084
I can be her legal guardian

01:24.084 --> 01:26.390
almost right after
you take custody.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.349
The adoption part
could take longer,

01:28.349 --> 01:29.654
but I'd have her
the whole time.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.613
You wouldn't have
to do a thing.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.531
She wants some time to think.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.054
She promised it would be soon,
so I've been checking my phone

01:38.054 --> 01:39.403
every two seconds.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.927
- That's a legit request.
- It is. I know.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.321
I'm sure she wants to talk
to her parents about it too.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.844
I'm glad I showed up in person.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.455
I could tell that made
an impression on her.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.934
I have a really good feeling
about this.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.022
Yeah, me too.

01:50.022 --> 01:52.155
I hope you guys are right.

01:52.155 --> 01:55.202
What happened when
you called Severide?

01:55.202 --> 01:58.770
It was fine, I guess.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.860
I asked him about
why he didn't tell me

02:01.860 --> 02:03.427
about the new job detail.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.603
He told me it came
up too suddenly.

02:05.603 --> 02:09.477
He kept telling me it was
no big deal and not to worry.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.566
Doesn't sound like it worked.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.177
He was just so vague
about everything,

02:14.177 --> 02:16.788
and not just what, exactly,
he's up to there,

02:16.788 --> 02:20.531
but also, uh...

02:20.531 --> 02:23.447
how it affects
when he comes home.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.539
He said that's a little
up in the air right now.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.239
I don't know
what's going on with him.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.814
Yes, this is
personal business.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.120
I'm sorry.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.469
It's a flyer
for my friend's band.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.297
I can pay you per page.
- No worries.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.343
I actually just wanted
to ask you a question.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.520
How long
after the lottery was done

02:52.520 --> 02:54.870
did you find out if your number
had been called?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.741
The thing is,
I heard that they drew

02:56.741 --> 02:58.178
this year's lottery, like,
a week ago,

02:58.178 --> 03:02.138
and I haven't gotten an email
or call or anything.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.618
Don't panic.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.316
With the CFD,
there are a million reasons

03:06.316 --> 03:08.188
for bureaucratic delays.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.667
Just give it
a little more time.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.192
Then if it's still
radio silence,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.019
I'll help you dig into it, okay?

03:14.019 --> 03:16.108
Okay. Yeah.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.458
Great.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.720
Thanks, Ritter.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.679
<i>Truck 81, Engine 51,
Ambulance 61.</i>

03:21.679 --> 03:24.856
<i>Multi-vehicle accident,
Roosevelt and Racine.</i>

03:39.480 --> 03:41.656
Mouch, Gallo--let's
grab four paratech struts,

03:41.656 --> 03:43.440
shore up this boat.
Carver, grab the jaws.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.007
- On it.
- Copy.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.052
Violet, Brett, stay back
until we stabilize this mess.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.271
Copy.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.707
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.883
I tried to make a right turn
from the center lane.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.189
It's just so stupid.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.886
I cut that guy off.
He clipped the trailer.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.498
The boat came loose
and landed on this poor lady.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.543
Then that one,
it bounced off her.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.371
All right.
Hey, I'll check the sedan.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.068
- Copy that.
- Stay here.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.549
Carver, go check on that SUV.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.468
You okay, ma'am?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.861
My ears are ringing.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.689
Yeah, yeah,
that's just the airbag.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.299
It'll stop soon.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.745
You hurt anyplace else?

04:27.745 --> 04:30.531
I don't know.
I'm--I'm--I'm shaking.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.576
It's okay, all right?
Take a deep breath.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.491
There you go.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.927
The worst part's over.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.321
Hey, where's the driver
of the SUV?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.149
I don't know, man.
He just took off.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.107
Took off? Like, on foot?

04:42.107 --> 04:44.327
Yeah, he grabbed a big
duffel out of the back,

04:44.327 --> 04:45.763
and he just ran, basically.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.809
I never got any chance
to talk to him.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.991
- Doing great. Almost there.
- Oh, thank you.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.601
I've never been
so afraid in my life.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.690
Ah, you're doing fine now.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.696
- What's your name?
- Christopher.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.698
Christopher,
thank you so much.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.440
- Yeah.
- Um...

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
Ms. Doreen...
- Yeah?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.358
Is a medium, and you must let
me repay you with a reading.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.012
Ah, that's okay, ma'am.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.622
You really don't need
to do this.

05:18.622 --> 05:21.538
Christopher, listen to me.

05:23.584 --> 05:28.502
You are going to experience
great pain very soon.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.287
I am so sorry.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.854
Okay, I gotta
get back to work.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.033
- Got it.
- Okay.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.340
Okay.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.819
One, two, three.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.346
One, two, three.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.351
Pulse is steady.
Let's get her on oxygen.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.830
Copy.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.487
Hey, your lady doing okay?

05:57.487 --> 05:59.446
She's off her nut, but yeah.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.491
She didn't get hurt at all.
- Good.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.537
And what about the SUV?

06:03.537 --> 06:04.668
I guess there
was one occupant,

06:04.668 --> 06:07.105
but he fled the scene.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.411
Fled why?

06:08.411 --> 06:10.718
Accident wasn't his fault.
- No idea.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.415
The boat guy said he grabbed
a big duffel out of the back

06:12.415 --> 06:14.722
and took off without a word.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.376
Hey, we got a cop on scene?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.551
Rolled up
a couple minutes ago.

06:17.551 --> 06:18.943
Yeah, send him my way,
would you?

06:18.943 --> 06:20.380
Yep.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.180
What do you think
the story is with the Tahoe?

07:26.881 --> 07:28.752
Yeah, I found this
in the back.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.711
Whoa.
...50 caliber?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.234
Oh, hell if know.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.541
But when I went to that meeting
with Homeland Security

07:34.541 --> 07:37.935
a while back, they told us
about an anti-government group

07:37.935 --> 07:40.721
they thought might be using
large caliber rounds

07:40.721 --> 07:43.637
to damage
electrical infrastructure.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.726
So what are you gonna do?

07:45.726 --> 07:47.423
I just texted this to Casey.

07:47.423 --> 07:51.819
I'll wait to see what he says
before I start to panic.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.736
Hey, good run?

07:55.736 --> 07:57.520
Boat accident on Roosevelt.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.262
Yeah, be glad
you didn't get called out.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.351
A lot of bad juju on that one.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.526
What do you mean?

08:03.526 --> 08:06.050
I helped out
this kooky palm reader,

08:06.050 --> 08:09.271
and she tells me that
I got trouble coming my way.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.751
Back up.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.753
You let her read your palm
in the middle of the call?

08:12.753 --> 08:14.624
Well, she didn't
give me a choice.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.540
First, it's meditation,
and now he's seeing a psychic.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.716
- What's this world coming to?
- It's not funny.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.979
What she said was awful.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.546
What'd she say?

08:23.546 --> 08:24.765
Well, she said...

08:26.462 --> 08:30.379
"You're gonna feel
great pain very soon."

08:32.033 --> 08:34.383
- Yeah, that's kinda creepy.
- Right?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.559
Who says to that somebody
they just met?

08:36.559 --> 08:39.431
I think you can safely
ignore any prophecies

08:39.431 --> 08:42.217
from a lady with a
"basic witch" bumper sticker.

08:42.217 --> 08:46.787
I'm not saying I believe her,
just that it was awful.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.962
Okay.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.144
Hey, Chief, any chance
you got a minute to talk?

08:56.144 --> 08:57.580
I'm actively
looking to do anything

08:57.580 --> 08:58.799
but this damn paperwork.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.541
So yes, please, come on in.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.369
What's up?

09:08.852 --> 09:10.419
Well, this is--

09:12.682 --> 09:14.597
It's gonna sound kinda strange.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.772
I can handle that.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.165
Okay.

09:17.165 --> 09:21.038
Can you tell me
about Benny Severide?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.608
Why do you ask?

09:25.608 --> 09:27.044
You can be honest.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.006
Look, I've heard Kelly's side,

09:32.006 --> 09:35.009
but I really want your take.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.058
It would mean a lot
to me, Chief.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.410
Okay.

09:47.238 --> 09:50.024
Benny was a wanderer,
which I'm sure you've heard.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.635
He never stayed anywhere
for very long,

09:52.635 --> 09:54.898
and it caused him as much pain

09:54.898 --> 09:57.858
as it caused the people
that he loved,

09:57.858 --> 10:00.251
even though he never showed it.

10:02.427 --> 10:06.127
According to Kelly's mom,
he showed it

10:06.127 --> 10:10.000
by drinking his way
through Illinois.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.918
Stella...

10:19.488 --> 10:20.620
What's going on?

10:25.363 --> 10:26.626
To tell you the truth...

10:29.237 --> 10:30.978
I don't really know.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.647
Hey. Are you waiting for me?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.997
No, not really.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.303
Yes, I guess I was.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.001
Still no word from Amber.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.177
And I was thinking about this,
she doesn't really know me,

10:56.177 --> 10:58.309
so why would she trust me?

10:58.309 --> 11:00.660
I'm sure you were clear
about how serious you are.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.532
Well, I said the words, but
what does that mean to Amber?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.403
I mean, she wants nothing
to do with this baby,

11:05.403 --> 11:07.101
and I'm asking her
to take custody

11:07.101 --> 11:08.624
so I can become the guardian.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.060
But what if I backed out?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.714
She'd have to go through
the whole painful experience

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
of handing her baby
back to the state again.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.631
She trusted you enough
to leave the baby here.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.676
That's something.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.286
I'm just not sure
it's enough.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.204
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.466
Not at all.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.469
We were just walking
to the locker room.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.992
Don't think
I haven't noticed

11:28.992 --> 11:30.167
how you've been
looking at him lately.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.778
You are totally
misreading that.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.083
Uh-huh.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.302
I mean, does he
look good in a towel?

11:34.302 --> 11:35.956
Yes. Am I allowed to look?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.218
Come on, Brett.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.399
Just say it,
I'm being overdramatic.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.879
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

11:45.879 --> 11:47.358
<i>- No?</i>
- Not at all.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.795
We were told
to have our radar up

11:48.795 --> 11:50.361
for threats to the power grid.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.233
Right, but all I found
was a bullet.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.801
<i>That bullet is called
a Raufoss round.</i>

11:54.801 --> 11:56.672
<i>...50 caliber BMG ammunition</i>

11:56.672 --> 12:00.154
with a high-explosive,
armor-piercing projectile.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.677
Raufoss.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.418
It's Norwegian
for red waterfall.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.376
- Oh, lovely.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:05.376 --> 12:07.204
It'll go clean through
steel armor and detonate

12:07.204 --> 12:08.379
on the other side.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.511
<i>Extremely destructive.</i>

12:09.511 --> 12:10.991
So what's this guy
doing with it?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.427
<i>Good question.</i>

12:12.427 --> 12:14.995
It's not illegal,
but it's incredibly expensive

12:14.995 --> 12:16.823
and very hard to get ahold of.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.347
You remember that incident
out here I talked about

12:19.347 --> 12:21.175
with the militia group?
- Sure.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.263
Those guys were
known to possess

12:22.263 --> 12:24.134
a cache of these rounds.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.353
There has to be a connection.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
So what are we gonna do?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.270
<i>I'm coming to you.</i>

12:29.270 --> 12:31.838
I'm gonna catch a redeye
to Chicago tonight.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.100
<i>Oh.</i>

12:33.100 --> 12:35.232
You need to reach out
to Chris McManus.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.713
<i>Remember him, your DHS contact
in the Midwest?</i>

12:37.713 --> 12:39.410
Yeah.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.630
<i>You need to tell him what
you found as soon as possible.</i>

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
Because I think
we're looking at exactly

12:43.414 --> 12:45.590
what those guys
have been warning us about.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.661
Can't sleep?

13:12.661 --> 13:13.836
No.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.536
Amber on your mind?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.147
That's a lot of it.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.498
Casey called to tell me he's
coming to Chicago tomorrow,

13:23.498 --> 13:26.414
and Dylan has been so great
with all this talk of a baby,

13:26.414 --> 13:28.242
and things are finally
going well with him

13:28.242 --> 13:32.072
after Casey's last visit
when I spun out a little.

13:32.072 --> 13:35.118
But it sounds like
it's good that he's coming.

13:35.118 --> 13:38.339
Is that the DHS threat
that's keeping you up,

13:38.339 --> 13:40.907
or is it Severide?

13:44.824 --> 13:48.262
Mama Severide, most of all.

13:48.262 --> 13:52.527
Some stuff she said
to me a few years ago

13:52.527 --> 13:54.877
has been ringing in my ears.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.837
She told me Kelly is destined
to become his father,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.449
and that is not a man
I should marry.

14:01.449 --> 14:02.754
She's wrong, Stella.

14:02.754 --> 14:03.973
I don't know anymore, Sylvie.

14:06.454 --> 14:11.720
Maybe Kelly really is
a wanderer at heart.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.942
Now that we've been
apart for a while,

14:15.942 --> 14:17.421
he's slipping right back
to that.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.687
We're losing our connection
no matter how hard I try.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.432
I know how tough it
can be trying to stay close

14:28.432 --> 14:30.608
over long distance.

14:30.608 --> 14:35.875
But as soon as you're together,
all those complications fade.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.572
Everything that you feel
for each other

14:37.572 --> 14:39.922
is gonna come rushing back.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.323
Come on.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.716
First there's all this
chit-chat in Kidd's office,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.631
and now you come poking at me?

14:53.631 --> 14:54.981
It's sleep time.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.721
I have an idea
I wanna run by you.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.640
How are you feeling
about giving up the crown?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.990
I have gotten
a little attached

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
to the lieutenant's title,
I'll admit it.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.255
Fits you like a glove too.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.083
When is Severide coming back?
Isn't it, like, a week or two?

15:10.083 --> 15:14.696
It was supposed
to be, but it might be longer.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.567
Why? What's going on?

15:16.567 --> 15:18.352
I'm not sure.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.963
Just that there might be some
kind of delay in his return.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.356
That's all I know.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.014
I--

15:28.014 --> 15:31.104
I just made this pot.
Who drank all the coffee?

15:31.104 --> 15:32.496
You did.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.976
I did?

15:33.976 --> 15:37.762
Well, it's no wonder,
after all the jibber-jabber

15:37.762 --> 15:39.242
in the bunk room last night.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.896
Hmm.
I slept right through it.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.942
- Same.
- Good for you.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.988
You see how well you sleep
after Ms. Doreen

15:45.988 --> 15:48.382
predicts a horrible fate
for you.

15:48.382 --> 15:51.515
I thought you said you didn't
believe in that claptrap.

15:51.515 --> 15:56.259
I don't, but after the year
that Cindy and I had,

15:56.259 --> 15:58.696
dark thoughts, they--
they come too easy.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.134
I can't stop
imagining the worst.

16:02.135 --> 16:06.704
Ms. Doreen's Psychic Parlor
and Witchcraft Emporium.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.663
Oh, my God.
Look at this website.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.839
Oh. Come on, Herrmann.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.275
You can't take this lady seriously.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.885
Look at that font.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.455
West Adams.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.674
I know where that place is.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.023
- Herrmann.
- What?

16:21.023 --> 16:22.938
Leave me alone.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.947
I hope we're wrong
about this,

16:31.947 --> 16:33.340
but I wanna be here

16:33.340 --> 16:34.776
if there's anything
I can do to help.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.996
I'm sure DHS appreciates it.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.127
I know Kidd does.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.134
I'm trying to adopt a baby.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.703
Really?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.139
Yeah.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.142
This little girl we rescued
right after she was born,

16:53.142 --> 16:55.492
there are some issues
with the birth mom, so--

16:55.492 --> 16:57.668
that probably sounds
crazy and sudden.

16:57.668 --> 16:58.843
No, it doesn't.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.020
You've always been great
with little ones.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.022
You had such a sweet connection
with Amelia

17:03.022 --> 17:04.893
right after she was born.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.329
Thanks, Matt.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.070
That means a lot.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.638
And this--this guy
you're seeing, Dylan,

17:10.638 --> 17:12.466
is he a part of this, or...?

17:12.466 --> 17:15.121
Oh, no. No.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.123
He's being supportive
and everything,

17:17.123 --> 17:19.647
but this is all me.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.695
Well, I'm happy for you.

17:24.695 --> 17:25.870
Thank you.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.091
Might not happen, honestly.

17:29.091 --> 17:34.096
But still, I can't help
but feel like it's--

17:34.096 --> 17:35.967
it's meant to be.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.061
McManus said so far, the
crashed Tahoe is a dead end.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.758
The vehicle was stolen
in Minnesota,

17:43.758 --> 17:46.848
but the tags belonged to a
different car from Champagne.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.850
FBI is still looking into that.

17:48.850 --> 17:53.811
Haven't found any usable prints
or DNA in the Tahoe.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.552
- None?
- That's what he said.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.380
What about
the .50 caliber round?

17:57.380 --> 18:00.427
They confirmed--it's one of
those scary Norwegian bullets.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.603
But since it's not illegal
to possess,

18:02.603 --> 18:04.648
they don't see anything here
yet that would cause them

18:04.648 --> 18:06.172
to raise their threat level.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.914
So did you come
all this way for nothing?

18:09.914 --> 18:11.351
I don't think so.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.918
This threat's been dangling
out there for too long.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.572
The other shoe has to drop
at some point.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.660
Okay.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.662
I can push HQ
to spread the word,

18:18.662 --> 18:20.360
be on the alert for attacks
on the energy grid.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.581
But beyond that, I'm not sure
what else we can do.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.409
I'll stick around
for a few days in case

18:26.409 --> 18:28.194
there are
any more developments.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.197
But hopefully,
I am wasting my time.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.154
That's the best case scenario.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.070
Really.
- Amen.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.072
Keep me in the loop.
- Absolutely, Chief.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.078
Hey, Kidd,
if you have to use the latrine,

18:43.078 --> 18:45.341
do it now
'cause it's road trip time.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.603
Where are you guys going?

18:56.439 --> 18:58.093
Thank you
for letting us come.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.747
We won't take up
much of your time.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.184
I can't believe you
drove all the way out here,

19:02.184 --> 19:03.664
just like Sylvie did.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.797
Amber has been through
plenty, as you guys know.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.147
This is a lot to ask of a kid,

19:08.147 --> 19:09.757
and if it was up to me,
you wouldn't be here.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.106
Dad.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.152
But Amber's got a big heart.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.590
We can tell.

19:16.590 --> 19:20.985
And we're here to support her,
not pressure her.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.209
We wanted you to be able
to make an informed decision,

19:27.209 --> 19:30.604
one you can
feel good about always.

19:30.604 --> 19:34.738
So as the people
who know Sylvie the best,

19:34.738 --> 19:37.088
we wanted to help you
get to know her too.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.221
And whatever you decide,
we get it.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.658
And we won't bother you again.

19:41.658 --> 19:44.400
It's not that I haven't been
thinking about all of this,

19:44.400 --> 19:48.056
but I can't, like, be a mom.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.753
You know?

19:49.753 --> 19:51.494
We do.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.061
And that's why
as soon as I heard

19:53.061 --> 19:56.238
what these guys were up to,
I wanted to join

19:56.238 --> 19:59.110
so I could tell you more
about the most

19:59.110 --> 20:03.332
amazing, caring person I know.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.815
I don't blame Amber for being
overwhelmed by all of this.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.425
She's only 16.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.514
It's a lot
for a teenager to handle.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.256
Maybe too much.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.131
This might be my last time
to see this little beauty.

20:21.785 --> 20:25.180
Even if it is, I've been
doing this a long time,

20:25.180 --> 20:27.095
and I know there will be
lots of other children

20:27.095 --> 20:28.966
who need homes in the future.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.404
And you'd be a wonderful mother
to any of them.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.058
Thank you, Patty.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.282
Have you given her a name yet?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.937
No, we've been calling
her honey or sweetie,

20:42.937 --> 20:46.854
the names we use with any baby
who won't be with us long.

20:50.510 --> 20:54.862
If she were mine,
I'd call her Julia

20:54.862 --> 20:56.777
after my birth mom.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.868
It suits her.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.716
Hey, excuse me.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.284
Christopher, come in.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.285
Come in.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.853
Come, please.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.247
Listen, lady,

21:32.247 --> 21:34.554
you can't say
what you said to me

21:34.554 --> 21:36.207
and just leave a guy hanging.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.384
I'm sorry.
That was not my intention.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.038
- Okay.
- Come, please.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.653
Okay.

21:46.653 --> 21:49.743
So what's the deal
with this great pain

21:49.743 --> 21:51.875
that the universe
has in store for me?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.616
'Cause I gotta know.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.705
Let me give you
a proper reading.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.098
Please, sit.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.326
Clear your mind
of all thoughts.

22:08.675 --> 22:13.332
Let the bad energy dissipate.

22:15.899 --> 22:19.163
Now we begin.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.295
All right.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.953
Credit card or Venmo?

22:25.953 --> 22:29.304
- What?
- It's $75 up front.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.306
I thought
this was on the house.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.090
The first reading yesterday
was gratis,

22:33.090 --> 22:35.876
but today's reading is $75.
- No. No.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.095
This was a mistake.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.446
- Christopher, please.
- No. No!

22:42.578 --> 22:45.059
Smart move, buddy.

22:45.059 --> 22:50.151
For 75 bucks she'll tell you
anything you wanna hear.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.380
- Hi.
- Come in.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.818
I just need one more second
to get ready.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.950
Movie's at 3:00, right?

23:06.950 --> 23:10.301
This is just the distraction
I need right now.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.216
I'm sorry, Sylvie,
but I can't go.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.436
What?

23:14.436 --> 23:15.742
I've been spinning out

23:15.742 --> 23:19.485
about things between us
nonstop, and...

23:19.485 --> 23:23.793
I hate to say this because
I really, really like you,

23:23.793 --> 23:26.492
but I think we need
to break up.

23:29.973 --> 23:32.411
I don't understand.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.151
I thought things
were going really well.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.241
Is this about the baby?

23:37.241 --> 23:38.417
Because that might
not even happen, Dylan.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.940
I know.

23:39.940 --> 23:45.511
But I can tell just the way
you've focused on her that

23:45.511 --> 23:48.383
we're at really different
places in our lives right now.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.126
You mean
you don't want a family.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.302
I do.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.303
Someday.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.915
But it's not just that.

24:01.527 --> 24:06.662
Last time Matt was here,
you went MIA on me for a while.

24:06.662 --> 24:10.536
And even when we were together,
you weren't all there.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.363
And now he's back.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.191
Look, he's here for work,
not for me.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.497
Are you sure about that?

24:17.064 --> 24:19.458
Either way, it's pretty obvious

24:19.458 --> 24:21.938
that you never really
got over him.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.293
Hey, you warned me
at the start that

24:29.293 --> 24:33.733
you weren't ready
for anything serious, and...

24:33.733 --> 24:35.212
you were right.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.867
I'm sorry.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.438
I really like being
with you, Dylan.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.919
You are a great guy.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.311
You're pretty great,
too, Sylvie.

24:50.140 --> 24:54.884
And I hope everything works out
with that little girl.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.511
I'm glad Casey is here
to keep an eye on it with you.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.642
He seems to know his stuff.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.383
He really does.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.472
I can see why DHS
has given him the job.

25:17.472 --> 25:18.517
Yep.

25:21.607 --> 25:25.611
How's everything with Severide?
That program still going good?

25:25.611 --> 25:28.527
Yeah, there's no doubt Kelly
loves working arson cases.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.964
He's really gotten
caught up in that world.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.010
Ah, here he is.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.451
Hey, any news?

25:40.451 --> 25:41.452
Yeah, a lot of it.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.150
DHS is suddenly
very interested.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.586
What changed their mind?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.370
The tags on that SUV?

25:46.370 --> 25:49.199
Turns out they're registered
to a false identity.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.592
So the FBI ran the number

25:50.592 --> 25:52.507
through this tracking system
they have.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.640
Those plates turned up
in surveillance footage

25:54.640 --> 25:57.599
on a different vehicle three
weeks ago in Libertyville,

25:57.599 --> 25:59.906
within blocks
of an unsolved break-in

25:59.906 --> 26:02.125
at some power company offices.
- Whoa.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.736
Now the FBI thinks
it was someone

26:03.736 --> 26:05.607
stealing
proprietary information

26:05.607 --> 26:08.262
about the Northern Illinois
electrical grid.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.829
So are they gonna
raise the threat level?

26:09.829 --> 26:12.614
Yes, but they still don't
know who they're looking for

26:12.614 --> 26:14.181
or when they'll strike.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.883
I'm gonna spend my shift
right here with this scanner.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.537
I'm gonna monitor
every incident

26:22.537 --> 26:24.757
that every CFD company
gets called out on.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.454
- I'll join you.
- Yeah.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.238
And hey, what's the name
of Brett's friend

26:28.238 --> 26:29.544
over at the 911 call center?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.024
- Hannah.
- Yeah.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.026
Let's reach out to her,
see if she can give us

26:33.026 --> 26:34.549
a heads-up
on anything suspicious.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.724
Smart.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.731
That's good.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.646
I mean, can you imagine
the look on Cindy's face

26:44.646 --> 26:48.563
if she saw that there was
a $75 bill for a psychic

26:48.563 --> 26:50.957
on the credit card?
- You'd be out on the street.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.393
You made the right call, Herrmann.

26:52.393 --> 26:53.612
Well, I'm glad I went, though.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.091
You know, it made me realize,
you know,

26:55.091 --> 26:56.353
how ridiculous this whole--

26:56.353 --> 26:57.659
Ah. Mm.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.183
Oh! Great pain, there it is.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.837
The prediction came true.

27:01.837 --> 27:02.969
There you go.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.492
See?

27:04.492 --> 27:07.495
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

27:25.252 --> 27:28.081
Still nothing from Amber.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.649
Brett's starting to lose hope.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.041
Damn.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.521
I feel for her.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.957
She's had a rough couple
of days between this

27:34.957 --> 27:37.525
and the breakup with Dylan.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.179
We made such
a good case with Amber.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.746
I really thought she'd call.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.921
Me too.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.531
We did everything we could.

27:43.531 --> 27:46.708
And that's what you do
for the people you love.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.406
Yeah, you are right.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.800
You give it everything
you have.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.721
51, this is Lieutenant Kidd.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.288
Hey. Yeah.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.075
Yeah. Yep.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.077
Uh-huh.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.078
Got it.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.993
Thanks, Hannah.

28:12.778 --> 28:16.042
Someone just reported smoke
coming out of a substation

28:16.042 --> 28:17.391
on South Jefferson.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.046
They just dispatched
Engine 62 to the scene.

28:20.046 --> 28:23.745
226 to Main, I will take on
that South Jefferson call,

28:23.745 --> 28:27.053
along with Truck 81,
Engine 51, and Squad 3.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.881
<i>Copy that, 226.
It's all yours.</i>

28:28.881 --> 28:30.447
And, Main,
let's roll dry chem

28:30.447 --> 28:32.449
and foam suppression units
as well.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.190
Truck 81, Squad 3, Engine 51,
we got a possible fire

28:34.190 --> 28:36.540
on 600 South Jefferson Street.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.846
Let's move.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.054
Hey, you know what happened?

29:12.054 --> 29:14.448
No, I just got here.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.711
That transformer's overheating,
and I don't know why.

29:16.711 --> 29:19.235
Chief, you see the damage
to the cooling fins?

29:21.020 --> 29:24.284
Looks like
large-caliber gunfire.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.417
I got dry chem and foam
suppression units en route.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.811
They're about 20 minutes out.
- We don't have 20 minutes.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.421
If that fire spreads
to the other banks,

29:31.421 --> 29:32.858
the whole substation
could go down.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.990
We're talking 8 million people
in the dark.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.906
We cannot spray water while
that transformer is energized.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.255
Can your people shut it down?

29:39.255 --> 29:40.909
I can do it manually
from the inside.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.476
- Then do it.
- Yes, sir.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.218
Okay, 51,
charge the hose line.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.436
Get ready on the deck gun.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.657
We're gonna wait for the--

29:49.657 --> 29:51.659
- Get down! Get down!
- Take cover!

29:51.659 --> 29:53.008
Shooter is still
on the scene!

29:53.008 --> 29:54.270
Move!

29:54.270 --> 29:55.619
What the hell
is going on here?

29:59.275 --> 30:00.842
Hey! Come here.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.801
10-1, 10-1. We are under fire.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.628
There's a sniper
in an elevated position.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.109
Respond with caution.
Everyone stay down.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.676
Shots are coming
from the east.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.373
Let's move.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.420
Hey, I can pull the engine
forward, shield that gate.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.900
That way we can get in there.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.948
I said, stay down!

30:19.948 --> 30:22.211
We have to keep the rigs
in between him and us.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.257
Chief, these are massive,
armor-piercing rounds.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.867
Even the rigs
might not protect us.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.390
That's all we got.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.653
We stay put, wait for PD.

30:35.572 --> 30:36.747
I see him.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.924
He's on a rooftop
about a block away.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.841
That's the cooling oil.
It's gonna go up fast now.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.756
Chief, I can get
to that rooftop

30:45.756 --> 30:47.062
and put an end to this.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.369
He can only fire
one round at a time.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.414
If I can make it to that
corner, I can get to him.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.416
Then all I have to do
is keep him distracted

30:53.416 --> 30:54.635
until the police arrive.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.071
No, you are not armed.

30:56.071 --> 30:58.595
Chief, we need
to get that fire out.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.467
All due respect, Chief,

31:00.467 --> 31:02.295
but I don't answer to you anymore.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.905
I'm going.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.994
- Casey--
- Chief, he's right.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.474
And we can't let him go alone.

31:07.474 --> 31:08.779
I'm going with him.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.781
We'll come too, Lieutenant.

31:10.781 --> 31:13.001
Gallo, Carver,
bring your irons.

31:13.001 --> 31:15.656
Mouch, you gotta stay
and work the aerial for me.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.963
You stay in radio contact,
you hear me?

31:17.963 --> 31:19.138
Okay?

31:19.138 --> 31:20.661
Distract,
let the cops take him out.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.184
Do not do anything stupid.

31:22.184 --> 31:23.403
Copy that.

31:23.403 --> 31:24.795
Be ready to attack those flames

31:24.795 --> 31:26.145
as soon as I give
the all-clear.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.537
I can get you guys
to the corner.

31:27.537 --> 31:28.582
Just stick behind Squad.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.193
Great. Let's go.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.298
He has to reload. Go now!

31:54.608 --> 31:57.176
- Watch it!
- Watch out!

32:01.006 --> 32:02.746
He's on top
of that parking garage.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.401
Come on.

32:15.281 --> 32:18.675
He'll be at the west end of the
roof with his back to us.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.112
Be quiet and quick.
- Okay.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.853
Hey, turn down your radios.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.464
Let's go.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.027
Fan out, flank the truck,

33:06.027 --> 33:08.377
and jump him as soon
as he fires the next shot.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.833
Get down!

33:33.794 --> 33:37.450
Gun is down. Gun is down.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.451
Kill that power now.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.500
Herrmann, get ready
with that water.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.198
Got it. Let's go!

33:49.984 --> 33:52.595
The shooter is
on that rooftop.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.929
Forget 'em! We gotta go!

34:32.592 --> 34:34.637
Hey! We got one here.

34:34.637 --> 34:37.075
The other one's driving
down the ramp, blue F-150.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.078
<i>Lieutenant Kidd, report.</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:41.905
We're okay.
There were two suspects.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.298
One's in custody.

34:43.298 --> 34:46.475
The other's in the wind,
but it's over.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.960
Okay.
Transformer's de-energized.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.049
Okay, 51, hit it!

35:04.493 --> 35:05.842
Mouch?

35:05.842 --> 35:08.018
Ah. Gah.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.019
Mouch, you okay?

35:09.019 --> 35:11.718
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.286
Hey, Chief!

35:14.286 --> 35:16.244
We need an ambulance!
Mouch is hit!

35:17.811 --> 35:19.291
Easy. Easy, bud.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.553
Easy, easy.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.866
They don't need to debrief
all of us, do they?

35:29.866 --> 35:31.694
This is crazy.
We should be with Mouch.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.261
That's the truth.

35:33.261 --> 35:36.525
Yeah, that cuckoo psychic
was right on the money.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.136
Great pain.

35:38.136 --> 35:42.488
Only way to describe
what I'm feeling right now.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.229
Hell with it, all right?
I'm not waiting.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.535
Ritter, let's mount up.
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

35:46.535 --> 35:47.971
Boden wants us to sit tight.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.191
There's nothing we can do
at Lakeshore.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.324
Chief's back.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.499
About time.

35:54.978 --> 35:57.285
Talk to us, Chief.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.940
- He's okay.
- Oh, thank God.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.900
- Mouch is okay.
- He is? Really?

36:03.900 --> 36:05.554
Didn't get hit
with one of them

36:05.554 --> 36:08.078
monstrous bullets,
just a bit of shrapnel.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.559
Doctors were able to remove
it, stop the bleeding.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.082
Trudy's with him right now.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.911
You can all look in
on him after shift.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.435
That's good to hear.

36:16.435 --> 36:19.220
Uh, they telling you
anything in there?

36:19.220 --> 36:21.091
Hmm. Yes.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.181
The guy we caught,
spilling his guts

36:23.181 --> 36:25.052
in an FBI interrogation room
right now.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.489
Gave up the location
of their safe house.

36:27.489 --> 36:28.577
They just intercepted
the sniper there

36:28.577 --> 36:29.796
a few minutes ago.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.754
And they're getting
lots more info

36:31.754 --> 36:33.539
on the rest
of the organization.

36:33.539 --> 36:37.064
The threat
has been neutralized.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.370
Well done.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.547
Hear, hear, you guys.
Nice work.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.113
You guys went to see Amber?

36:46.856 --> 36:48.554
Yeah.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.120
To tell her about you.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.167
So she'd feel like
she could trust you completely.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.082
She's just called.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.127
She's gonna take back
custody of the baby.

36:57.127 --> 36:58.259
Really?

36:58.259 --> 36:59.434
Yes.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.436
I'm gonna adopt Julia.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.047
Congratulations!

37:04.047 --> 37:05.484
- Sylvie.
- Wow.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.355
That's fantastic.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.965
Thank you.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.360
Thank you.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.144
Come on.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.157
- Hey, Ritter.
- Hey. Any news?

37:27.157 --> 37:29.334
There's so much going on
with everyone,

37:29.334 --> 37:30.770
so I don't want to make
a big deal about it,

37:30.770 --> 37:35.514
but I wanted you to know
my number was called.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.037
I'm going to the Academy.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.866
Yeah, you are!

37:39.866 --> 37:41.259
Oh.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.871
Welcome to the best job
in the world.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.176
Yeah?

38:05.718 --> 38:06.849
You moving?

38:08.634 --> 38:10.679
No.

38:10.679 --> 38:14.857
But I am taking
the next few shifts off.

38:14.857 --> 38:17.207
Yeah? Where are you headed?

38:17.207 --> 38:21.342
I'm going to get my husband
and bring him back to Chicago.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.352
And she is over the moon.

38:31.352 --> 38:34.616
And Cruz is almost as happy,
keeps talking about how

38:34.616 --> 38:36.096
adoption is the greatest thing

38:36.096 --> 38:38.316
that could ever happen
to a person.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.276
And it made me think that

38:42.276 --> 38:46.367
had I been able
to pick my own kids,

38:46.367 --> 38:47.716
maybe I'd have better ones.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.374
- That's great.
- Yeah.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.941
Yeah, Sylvie deserves it.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.638
Yeah.

38:56.638 --> 38:57.987
Hey, you okay?

38:59.467 --> 39:01.730
You're looking a lot paler
than when I walked in here.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.428
- I do?
- Yeah.

39:05.821 --> 39:09.521
My side is kinda barking
at me again.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.349
Huh?

39:14.177 --> 39:15.222
Mouch.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.401
Oh, what the hell is this?

39:20.401 --> 39:24.187
Mouch! Hey!

39:24.187 --> 39:25.580
Help!

39:25.580 --> 39:28.278
Please, we need a doctor
in here now!

39:28.278 --> 39:29.541
Help, please!

39:52.128 --> 39:53.608
Matt, hi.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.393
Hey, Sylvie.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.308
Um, come on in.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.361
Our first kiss
was right here.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.105
I remember it pretty well.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.021
So do I.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.115
I got something
about a year and a half ago,

40:22.115 --> 40:26.467
and I wanted to give it to you
before I go back to Portland.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.295
Oh.

40:35.171 --> 40:40.002
Sylvie Brett,
we were meant to be.

40:42.657 --> 40:46.748
Will you make me and three kids

40:46.748 --> 40:50.186
the luckiest family
in the world

40:50.186 --> 40:51.318
and marry me?
