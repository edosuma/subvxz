WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:08.925
[theme music plays]

00:22.772 --> 00:25.316
[Clay] So, yeah, there was a riot.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.862
I blew up a car, and it did some damage.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.449
[Alex] Charlie, wake up.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.826
Charlie, please. Wake up.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.166
-[Alex] Charlie, come on. Please.
-[groans] No.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.335
Come on, my folks are up.
You gotta sneak out.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.049
-OK.
-Yeah.

00:49.132 --> 00:49.966
Yeah.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.053
-You sleep like you're dead.
-[chuckles]

00:53.595 --> 00:55.764
I like sleep. [inhales slowly]

00:55.847 --> 00:57.348
I like sleeping next to you.

00:57.807 --> 00:58.892
Yeah, me too.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.560
[Charlie chuckles]

01:03.480 --> 01:07.192
Someday, maybe we could do more
than just literally sleep together?

01:07.275 --> 01:10.737
Yes, we will someday,
but right now, you gotta go.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.616
Or I could stay and meet your parents.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.787
[scoffs] Yeah, or we could meet your dad
and the entire Liberty High Booster Club,

01:18.870 --> 01:20.830
-of which he's the president.
-[laughs]

01:20.914 --> 01:21.873
Torsheer.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.625
You mean touchÃ©?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.294
No. I don't know that word.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.337
[both laugh]

01:27.420 --> 01:28.880
Just get out. Go.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.305
[Clay] The real damage it did was
put Dean Foundry on the warpath.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.933
[Zach] I don't know why
I raised a bat at the police.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.893
[sighs] I was out of my mind.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.021
Destroying all my personal possessions
wasn't enough to work it all out?

01:45.980 --> 01:48.608
You went through your file,
and you took one thing out:

01:48.691 --> 01:50.485
the letter from Coach Kerba.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.153
Why?

01:53.488 --> 01:54.489
I, uh...

01:55.365 --> 01:57.909
[inhales deeply, sighs heavily]
I don't know.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.286
[Foundry] Some students last week
had legitimate grievances.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.330
Some were just venting anger,

02:02.413 --> 02:05.166
but I don't really think it's me
that you're angry at,

02:06.000 --> 02:06.876
is it?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.135
Justin.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.306
Justin, hey. Justin, come on,
we cannot be late for our first day back.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.850
-Come on.
-Shit, that's today?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.643
[Clay] Yeah, school was closed for a week,

02:23.726 --> 02:25.854
but we still have to make it up
at the end of the year.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.022
And apparently, there's a whole...

02:29.065 --> 02:31.025
investigation into what started it,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.069
what you and Diego were fighting about.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.529
Fuck!

02:36.114 --> 02:37.115
Hey, are...

02:39.909 --> 02:40.910
Are you OK?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.788
-Yeah, I have the flu or some shit.
-The flu?

02:44.205 --> 02:45.290
Or some shit?

02:46.082 --> 02:47.917
I haven't used in days.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.044
-You told me you would stop.
-I did, I...

02:51.880 --> 02:53.339
I mean, this... this...

02:54.841 --> 02:56.176
It's just what it must be.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.596
-Look, I just need some sleep.
-[sighs]

03:00.471 --> 03:04.225
Justin, I'm not saying
I've got my own shit dealt with, but...

03:04.726 --> 03:07.437
do you need to go back to rehab?
Or, like...

03:08.104 --> 03:10.815
My folks could get you, I don't know,
they have addiction doctors--

03:10.899 --> 03:13.443
-I don't wanna spend more of their money.
-We should do something.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.528
I don't want them to know I relapsed!

03:16.821 --> 03:20.074
Clay, just give me a minute
to get better again, OK?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.245
[labored breathing]

03:25.205 --> 03:26.956
Yeah. Of course.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.250
Do you need anything?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.294
You should go to school.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.594
[Clay] We all still had these secrets
that might be exposed.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.555
-[door opens, closes]
-[Foundry] We can't expel everybody,

03:43.306 --> 03:48.311
or suspend everybody, so it's important
we... identify the instigators

03:48.394 --> 03:50.521
and those responsible for the most damage.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.690
Hmm. Is that why
you suspended Zach a week?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.359
Who instigated your involvement?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.320
What were Diego and Justin fighting about?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.530
A student mentioned
hearing them talk about a tape.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.868
Well, my involvement was instigated

04:03.952 --> 04:07.705
by an oppressive police state
trampling on students' rights.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.708
Really? In the Marines,
I did a tour on the Korean DMZ.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.544
I'll tell you about a police state
sometime.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.755
[Clay] And then, things got worse.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.925
So your response to all of this is just...

04:19.300 --> 04:20.927
[scoffs] ...more punishment?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.973
The police have deferred prosecution
pending our investigation,

04:25.056 --> 04:27.725
so we need to find out
who did what, and why.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.104
Hey, look, punish me, fine,

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
but don't cancel prom.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.691
That's not fair.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.027
Jessica, a group of parents managed
to get a county judge

04:38.111 --> 04:40.571
to issue a gang injunction
against the students at Liberty.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.739
We can't have a prom.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.241
That's insane.

04:43.324 --> 04:47.287
Yeah, no, it wouldn't have been my choice
on how to proceed, but there we are.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.038
You can help me...

04:49.914 --> 04:51.958
if you can let me in on a secret:

04:52.458 --> 04:55.169
why Justin and Diego
were fighting in the first place.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.214
Why Clay Jensen's
destroying security cameras.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.466
What's really going on here?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.093
[sighs]

05:03.052 --> 05:05.096
What's really going on here...

05:06.139 --> 05:07.765
is that we're gonna have a prom.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.352
And I'm gonna fucking dance

05:11.769 --> 05:13.813
like I don't have a care in the world,

05:13.896 --> 05:16.566
and for one minute, just one,

05:17.442 --> 05:20.236
I'll be free from all of this shit.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.823
And I wish I could promise that, Jessica.
I truly do, but I can't.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.867
I don't need you to.

05:26.826 --> 05:27.827
I'll make it happen.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.040
-[sighs]
-[Caleb] You could be dead right now.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.334
-[Tony] But I'm not.
-Or in jail.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.253
-But I'm not.
-You literally cheat death

05:37.337 --> 05:39.422
-in a bullshit pro-am match.
-I did not cheat death.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.967
-I got knocked down once.
-By a white supremacist,

05:43.426 --> 05:48.389
and then you escape with your life
only to go join a riot and assault a cop.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.933
Winn talked him down,
he's letting it go, so...

05:51.017 --> 05:53.436
I don't know
why we're rehashing this right now.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.648
Nevada needs to hear from you, Tony.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.859
Or not hear from me.

06:01.235 --> 06:05.239
Why are you so hell-bent
on destroying a really good future?

06:05.323 --> 06:08.451
I have a garage to take care of.
That's my future.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.162
You weren't arrested last week,

06:12.288 --> 06:14.082
so what else is it, Tony?

06:14.499 --> 06:17.668
-What are you not telling me?
-Don't you have to open the gym?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.884
[Clay] We couldn't just wait
for things to cool down.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.805
There were people
who didn't want that to happen.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.057
They bring the riot in here?

06:31.140 --> 06:34.435
Uh, no. I think someone searched it
while school was off.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.354
Looking for what?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.690
Uh, girls. Can you give us a minute?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.445
[sighs] A whole week.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.322
Not even a text.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.990
I was grounded.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.784
No screens.

06:50.535 --> 06:54.080
So, uh, if I look at your phone,
I won't see any texts to Justin?

06:54.163 --> 06:56.749
Uh, you won't look at my phone, and no.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.503
Yeah, he sure was protective of you.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.631
Sure didn't want you arrested.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.883
Probably just wanted you arrested more.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.432
You're... you're playing this so cool
when it can go really bad for you.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.060
What exactly do you think
you're threatening me with?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.605
I think you know.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.067
[laughs derisively]

07:23.818 --> 07:24.735
That's funny.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.070
I gotta tell Justin.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.823
Don't you fucking laugh at me.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.116
[Diego breathes heavily]

07:30.199 --> 07:31.617
[tense music plays]

07:38.916 --> 07:40.418
I'm on my way to Foundry.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.046
Maybe I'll talk.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.548
So talk.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.481
[Ellman] And what is it
you're afraid the dean will find out?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.358
I'm sure he knows about the car.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.528
I haven't told anyone yet
about the cameras or the graffiti

08:07.612 --> 08:11.282
or all the things I did to my friends,
like, on the camping trip.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.367
I... I've only told you.

08:13.451 --> 08:17.497
Do you think the dean might already know
at least some of those things?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.706
Maybe. I...

08:18.789 --> 08:20.416
-Do you want to tell him?
-No!

08:22.001 --> 08:23.252
Do your friends know?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.755
No. I don't think so.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.381
Do you wanna tell them?

08:28.424 --> 08:29.592
You think I should?

08:31.552 --> 08:35.348
I'm not saying that. I'm asking you
what you think you should do.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.351
[sighs, inhales deeply]

08:39.227 --> 08:41.312
[Ellman] Clay,
we broke through last week.

08:41.771 --> 08:45.650
Unlocking the secrets you've been keeping,
the trauma you've been suppressing,

08:45.733 --> 08:48.945
that's the key to dealing
with the anxiety and dissociation,

08:49.820 --> 08:53.241
but I don't think
we've begun to really work on that trauma.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.327
I think there's too much
you're still not talking about.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.080
I keep secrets.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.623
For sure.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.001
[clicks tongue]
And I keep secrets from my friends,

09:06.712 --> 09:09.423
but also for my friends.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.094
[Ellman] I hope we can talk
about more of those secrets,

09:13.928 --> 09:16.514
but maybe you could start
by talking with your friends.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.853
Jesus Christ, Clay.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.523
You're gonna destroy us.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.649
I'm sorry.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.904
I wasn't in my right head for a long time.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.323
Foundry's interviewing
every single person.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.702
He's gonna find out
why Clay's been doing all that shit.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.955
So what?
So, they interview us all one by one.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.790
[slaps thighs] We just lie.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.625
I mean, we all know how to do that.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.127
I got pretty good at it.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.088
Might not be the answer,
speaking from experience.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.967
-They talked to Diego today.
-And you have Diego handled, right?

09:53.467 --> 09:57.013
Here's the thing. Diego's on to us.
So is Estela, so is Winston.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.014
Foundry heard the tape,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.600
and now he's interrogating
the whole school, starting with Diego,

10:00.683 --> 10:01.767
and who knows what he said.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.936
They're only doing this
because of the parents.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.188
My dad told me
all the Boosters have been calling him.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.941
They asked for an investigation,
and the school caved.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.568
So we are dead.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.362
What if we got our parents
back on our side?

10:13.779 --> 10:17.325
But they have, like, computer stats
on how much we lie to them.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.160
How do we get them to trust us now?

10:20.369 --> 10:21.537
Tell them the truth.

10:24.081 --> 10:24.957
[scoffs]

10:25.541 --> 10:27.835
Uh, I mean,
you don't tell them all the truth.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.172
You never tell them everything,
but you just tell them enough.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.383
Enough that's true
to make them trust us again.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.428
-We're in a war here.
-[Charlie] Yeah, and we're losing.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.930
We get 'em back on our side,
we might have a chance.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.308
We ask them
to help us stop an investigation?

10:42.391 --> 10:43.559
[Charlie] Not directly.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.896
First, we get them on our side
by confiding in them,

10:46.979 --> 10:48.105
and then...

10:49.023 --> 10:52.109
we ask them to help us get back prom.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.737
It's like a bait and switch.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.199
Ease off the police state
so we can get back prom,

10:58.574 --> 11:01.369
and the investigation quietly goes away

11:02.036 --> 11:04.288
before they put it all together.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.958
And they're gonna believe
that we care about prom?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.252
I actually do.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.089
Yeah, so do I.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.008
Yeah, me too.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.845
[exhales] Tell our parents the truth.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.932
[chuckles] This might be
the riskiest thing we've ever done.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.353
[door opens]

11:28.312 --> 11:30.064
-[Clay] Bye, Charlie.
-See you, man.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.651
I'm sorry...

11:34.443 --> 11:36.862
for whatever you think I did with Diego.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.323
But you pushed me away.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.119
You wouldn't let me help you,
then you gave up on yourself

11:43.202 --> 11:44.286
again and again.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.288
You're the one who left.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.708
I was trying to make my way back to you.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.419
But you were so angry with me.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.546
-You broke my fucking heart!
-[scoffs]

11:54.296 --> 11:57.049
I think your heart was broken
way before you met me.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.304
[Clay] I don't think
we really cared about prom,

12:03.931 --> 12:07.476
but if we could get our parents
back on our side, it sure would help.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.272
So just to be clear,
you're not fans of Gordon Lightfoot then?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.276
I didn't even know
who he was before this, Dad.

12:15.359 --> 12:19.238
We didn't know
you'd start... singing his songs.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.408
Alex Standall is obsessed with this song

12:22.491 --> 12:26.704
"The... Wreck of Edward Fitzgerald."

12:26.787 --> 12:28.998
Edmund Fitzgerald.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.000
It's a classic.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.295
Uh, but the point here is
that you've been lying to us.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.588
[Justin] Not lying.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.089
Just not...

12:38.090 --> 12:39.175
telling the truth.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.843
[Clay] What about you?

12:41.635 --> 12:44.054
You lied about
putting those tracking apps on our phones,

12:44.138 --> 12:46.974
and you paid for all that security
and those drills.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.518
Did you forget to mention that
while I was strapped to a gurney?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.605
Clay, we never meant for that to happen.
We were trying...

12:54.398 --> 12:55.399
We thought...

12:56.192 --> 12:58.944
somehow those things
might help keep you safe.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.530
[Lainie] We're your parents.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.532
If you won't tell us
what's going on in your life,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.701
we still have to know somehow.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.161
What about just asking us?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.413
[Lainie] We ask all the time!

13:09.497 --> 13:11.624
I think you know that's gotten us nowhere.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.501
That's fair.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.423
OK, so... new deal.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.928
If you're really worried about my safety,
about keeping me alive,

13:24.303 --> 13:26.180
we have to trust each other again.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.557
We have to talk.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.476
We'd like that.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.479
Although, at this point,

13:33.562 --> 13:37.191
it seems that you know more of our secrets
than we do of yours.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.321
[sighs]

13:45.783 --> 13:47.284
The vandalism at school,

13:48.285 --> 13:49.703
the broken windows,

13:50.663 --> 13:51.872
Bolan's car,

13:54.208 --> 13:55.334
I did all those.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.630
Dr. Ellman thinks
I may have been dissociating,

14:00.047 --> 14:02.383
because I don't remember any of it.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.304
And I'm... I'm...
I'm working to integrate my trauma,

14:08.222 --> 14:10.933
to live with it rather than shut it off.

14:13.102 --> 14:13.936
Oh...

14:14.478 --> 14:15.312
honey.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.820
[sighs heavily] I've, um...

14:25.614 --> 14:26.782
I've been using again.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.950
[sighs]

14:28.325 --> 14:31.453
[Justin] And I got fired from Monet's
for stealing money,

14:32.121 --> 14:33.622
and I... I stole...

14:34.123 --> 14:35.624
a few things from you guys,

14:37.001 --> 14:39.044
a watch and a necklace...

14:39.670 --> 14:40.629
to buy.

14:41.881 --> 14:42.882
Justin.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.426
[Justin] I'm not using right now,

14:45.926 --> 14:48.137
but it's been pretty rough this time.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
Do you need to go back into treatment?

14:51.765 --> 14:52.766
I hope not.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.810
I'm gonna just...

14:55.519 --> 14:57.313
I think I need a few days to...

14:58.898 --> 15:01.150
rest and clean up, and, uh...

15:02.234 --> 15:05.988
I'm gonna start working the steps again,
and...

15:06.864 --> 15:08.115
I'll pay you guys back.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.619
[Matt] Justin, you need to know
we are here to help you through this,

15:11.952 --> 15:12.953
but, boys,

15:13.746 --> 15:14.788
these are both...

15:15.581 --> 15:17.207
much bigger discussions.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.792
[Clay] Yes,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.211
and... and we will have them,

15:24.173 --> 15:25.174
but, um...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.969
we just... we need your help on something.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.223
We want to go to prom.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.485
So...

15:45.361 --> 15:46.862
kid... [exhales slowly]

15:48.072 --> 15:50.824
...what's the news
that requires a public meeting?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.534
Start another riot?

15:54.286 --> 15:55.371
No. [chuckles]

15:55.454 --> 15:56.914
No, it's nothing like that.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.166
Uh, it's...

16:01.210 --> 16:02.211
Um...

16:02.836 --> 16:05.005
So, yeah. Um... [sighs]

16:07.091 --> 16:08.342
I'm not...

16:09.093 --> 16:10.886
one hundred percent straight.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.472
I'm not any percent straight.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.101
I'm bisexual, I guess,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.355
and I like people for people,

16:22.898 --> 16:23.732
and...

16:24.400 --> 16:26.360
I have a boyfriend currently.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.448
[chuckles lightly]

16:31.824 --> 16:32.741
Yeah.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.869
What do you mean, "yeah"?

16:35.953 --> 16:37.079
[dad] I mean,

16:38.956 --> 16:39.957
I love you...

16:41.166 --> 16:42.167
so much.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.919
Always have, always will,

16:45.379 --> 16:47.214
and you make me so proud.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.842
By not being straight.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.176
By being yourself.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.723
But wait, wait, wait,
what did you mean by "yeah"?

16:56.348 --> 16:57.975
-Did you know?
-I...

16:59.059 --> 17:01.520
I could sense
that you were figuring something out

17:01.603 --> 17:03.063
about your sexuality.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.023
How?

17:04.606 --> 17:07.484
Just... watching you, living with you.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.028
But, like, what?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.154
Specifically.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.866
Well... no self-respecting
middle school quarterback

17:13.949 --> 17:16.035
is that big a fan of Eli Manning.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.038
He has two Super Bowl rings.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.874
-He got them almost by accident.
-And he never gives up.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.752
A good quality when you throw
more interceptions than completions.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.212
How are you doing this to Eli Manning?
You said you loved me.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.506
I do, and in the eighth grade,

17:29.590 --> 17:32.217
you had Eli Manning wallpaper
on your phone.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.511
-He was a very good quarterback.
-He was shirtless.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.721
He's very handsome.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.431
He absolutely is.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.809
[both chuckle]

17:42.019 --> 17:43.062
[laughs]

17:44.688 --> 17:47.066
You didn't think
this was gonna change anything?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.401
[Charlie] Well, you never know.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.905
I mean,
we don't always talk about everything.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.574
Since Mom.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.121
I know.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.084
We'll get better at that.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.006
You know I love you like crazy,
though, right?

18:12.132 --> 18:13.759
[chuckles lightly] Yeah.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.472
Which, uh, is good,

18:19.681 --> 18:20.849
because I need a favor.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.310
[laughs]

18:26.271 --> 18:27.272
How'd I know?

18:27.815 --> 18:28.816
[Charlie chuckles]

18:30.526 --> 18:33.612
Ah, I'm gonna miss these meetings
when you're off at college,

18:34.446 --> 18:36.865
far, far away.

18:37.699 --> 18:38.826
Here's the proposal.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.870
I'll take full responsibility
for the riot.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.749
You suspend me as long as you need to,
but you don't expel me.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.917
The police charge me

18:47.000 --> 18:48.460
with instigating a riot,

18:48.544 --> 18:53.841
and they drop all charges on anyone else,
especially Justin and Diego.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.802
You know
that'll destroy your college admissions.

18:56.885 --> 18:57.886
[Jess chuckles] Maybe,

18:58.470 --> 19:01.056
and you know
that the police response was excessive,

19:01.431 --> 19:05.310
and YouTube and Twitter are both
heavily agreeing, and you know that too.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.564
I have a number of parents,
including my father, the colonel,

19:08.647 --> 19:12.943
and Mrs. Achola, an immigrant,
prepared to ask why students of color

19:13.026 --> 19:17.114
were disproportionately singled out
in the questioning.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.492
-Do we know that they were?
-[Jess] Do you really want to count?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.161
Mrs. Jensen is in court today,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.664
asking that the injunction be lifted
on all school-sanctioned events.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.668
The Booster Club's agreed to chaperone.
The president is writing you a letter.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.588
All we need is
for you to sanction the prom

19:33.213 --> 19:35.299
and drop the investigation,

19:35.883 --> 19:39.094
and tell the venue
that we're not actual gang members.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.013
Hmm. Do I know that's true?

19:41.763 --> 19:42.723
Gary.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.351
I'm gonna start calling you Gary, OK?

19:46.852 --> 19:50.689
You've said from the beginning
of this year that you wanted to help us,

19:50.772 --> 19:53.150
to keep us safe, protect us.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.445
Help us have the best
high school experience we could have.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.113
Well, I suppose that's...

19:59.072 --> 20:00.199
fair to say.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.659
[Jess] Things got messed up for all of us,

20:03.452 --> 20:07.873
but if we cancel prom,
then messed-upness wins.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.292
Let's not let it win.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.921
And prom and graduation
will go off uninterrupted?

20:14.004 --> 20:17.883
With the class president
giving a speech at graduation per usual.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.302
Vetted by the administration per usual.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.095
Fine.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.723
Deal?

20:26.725 --> 20:28.727
Give me 24 hours. [exhales slowly]

20:29.353 --> 20:30.229
[chuckles]

20:30.771 --> 20:33.357
Thank you, Peter. [Carolyn giggles]

20:33.815 --> 20:34.650
[Peter] Hey.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.693
-There you are, boys.
-[Bill] Hey, guys.

20:36.777 --> 20:40.239
[Carolyn] I don't believe Peter and I
have met our dinner guest tonight.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.949
Uh, yeah. This is Charlie.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.076
Charlie St. George, the new quarterback.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.078
Yep, um, and...

20:46.578 --> 20:47.913
uh, also,

20:48.872 --> 20:49.998
he's my boyfriend.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.630
Well, good to see you again, Charlie.
I hope you like steak.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.714
Yes, sir.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.092
You're dating the fucking quarterback?
Sweet!

21:00.175 --> 21:02.261
-Peter, language.
-[Peter] That's awesome!

21:02.636 --> 21:03.971
Charlie, you're sitting here, man.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.431
Come on,
we gotta talk about Liberty's offense.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.559
-Come on.
-Good luck, Charlie.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.229
-[Charlie chuckles]
-Hey. First of all, man, here.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.982
-You OK?
-Yeah, no. I...

21:15.399 --> 21:16.692
[Peter] It's not working.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.820
I don't know. I thought this would be
a bigger deal, somehow.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.448
Well, is he good to you?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.158
Does he make you happy?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.952
[Peter] All right? Good.

21:27.411 --> 21:31.540
Then you do play action. Three-step drop,
hit the quick passes on the corner route.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.083
Yeah.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.918
A lot.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.879
Then it's a very big deal to me.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.798
[chuckles lightly]

21:43.176 --> 21:46.138
[Clay] Maybe prom could change the subject
once and for all.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.598
[upbeat music plays]

21:51.935 --> 21:52.769
We got it.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.855
-Prom is on.
-[girl 1] What?

21:54.938 --> 21:56.148
-Yes!
-[girls squeal]

21:56.231 --> 21:58.734
-[whooping]
-[girl 2] I'm so behind.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.821
[Ani] What?

22:03.196 --> 22:04.948
Oh, well, it's not like I'm going.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.993
Another big victory, and I'm the loser,

22:08.702 --> 22:09.703
yet again.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.582
You know, I'm just gonna quit politics
and marry rich.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.293
Yeah, that'll go well. You know,
rich people, in general, are aces.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.252
Yeah.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.464
Look, why don't you just go with me
to prom?

22:21.715 --> 22:22.799
Oh, no. No.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.927
We're not doing
the whole pathetic friends thing.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.348
OK, so let's do
the fucking not pathetic friends thing.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.893
-Jessica Davis.
-Oh, my God.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.146
You and I have fought like lovers.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.441
Now, I've talked sex with you
more than I have with any man.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.360
-Hm.
-I believe I had a crush on you

22:41.443 --> 22:43.070
since the first time
I saw you going mental

22:43.153 --> 22:45.030
at a student council meeting.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.073
[Jess chuckles]

22:46.156 --> 22:50.202
So will you, not as friends,
not as girlfriends,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.954
but as you and me,

22:53.997 --> 22:55.415
will you go to prom with me?

23:00.921 --> 23:02.130
What are you doing?

23:04.549 --> 23:07.511
-âª You're just too good to be true âª
-[groans]

23:07.594 --> 23:11.431
-[girls giggle]
-âª Can't take my eyes off of youÂ âª

23:11.515 --> 23:15.227
-âª You'd be like heaven to touchÂ âª
-[laughter]

23:15.310 --> 23:18.688
-âª I want to hold you so muchÂ âª
-[Jess chuckles]

23:18.814 --> 23:19.856
âª At long last--Â âª

23:19.940 --> 23:21.733
OK, OK, OK! Fine, fine, fine. Yes!

23:21.817 --> 23:23.985
-[Ani] Yeah?
-I'll go to prom with you.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.946
You have a really good singing voice.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.156
Oh, thank you. You know, I expect a limo.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.074
Fine.

23:29.533 --> 23:34.371
["Love Me Like The World Is Ending" plays]
âª This is the first day of the futureÂ âª

23:38.667 --> 23:41.795
âª And all I want is youÂ âª

23:45.549 --> 23:49.636
âª I wear a pair of socks you left hereÂ âª

23:52.180 --> 23:54.599
âª But I know, I know, I knowÂ âª

23:54.683 --> 23:58.937
âª Nobody could ever fill your shoes... âª

24:00.856 --> 24:05.652
You know, I had everything
sorted to a specific plan,

24:06.403 --> 24:09.072
but I was a different person back then,

24:09.156 --> 24:11.825
so now,
all my sorting criteria have changed,

24:11.908 --> 24:14.369
and I have to reassess everything.

24:14.953 --> 24:15.871
Tyler,

24:16.746 --> 24:19.416
you think maybe you're a little OCD?

24:19.499 --> 24:21.168
[chuckles] A little?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.086
-Please!
-[giggles]

24:26.548 --> 24:28.383
[Estela] She's so beautiful.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.844
That's Hannah Baker, right?

24:32.762 --> 24:33.597
Yeah.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.184
Yeah, she was very beautiful.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.521
She was also... She was really nice to me
when most people weren't.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.361
Hey,

24:49.488 --> 24:50.822
would you, um...

24:52.324 --> 24:53.283
[exhales nervously]

24:53.366 --> 24:56.328
Uh, would you ever want
to go to prom with me?

24:57.579 --> 24:58.580
Prom? [chuckles]

24:58.663 --> 25:01.333
As in, like... like, senior prom?

25:01.416 --> 25:02.375
Yeah.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.543
No, right, yeah.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.669
No, that's...

25:05.504 --> 25:07.923
-You probably feel, like, really weird.
-[laughs]

25:08.006 --> 25:09.174
Hell, yes!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.594
I'll go to senior prom with you.
Are you kidding me?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.179
Really?

25:15.138 --> 25:16.056
Yeah.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.391
Yeah... Yeah. Cool.

25:18.934 --> 25:19.935
Cool. Yeah.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.478
Let's do it.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.115
Well, that's just creepy.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.288
-[groans]
-[door closes]

25:40.747 --> 25:43.667
-Coffee and doughnuts.
-No time for a break, but thank you.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.795
-Come on. Come have a doughnut.
-I will when I have time for a break.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.296
Why can't you take a break now?

25:48.380 --> 25:52.175
Because I'm in the middle of this rebuild,
and if I stop now, I have to clean up,

25:52.259 --> 25:53.510
and I lose a half an hour.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.929
Well, I'll feed them to you,
piece by luscious piece.

25:56.012 --> 25:59.516
OK, this is a place of business,
and since when do you bring doughnuts?

25:59.599 --> 26:03.770
Well, I was talking with Ani
about things, about us.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.357
She's living with us.
She's entitled to an opinion.

26:07.857 --> 26:11.444
And she helped me figure out a way
to show you that whatever you decide,

26:11.528 --> 26:14.614
whatever you do in life,
I love you and I support you.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.700
So you brought me doughnuts?

26:16.783 --> 26:18.034
[Caleb] Special doughnuts.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.328
Javi, guys.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.664
Doughnut time.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.166
What are you doing, man?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.758
Well, you gonna say yes, bro?

26:36.511 --> 26:37.929
[Alex] I'll be home at, like, 5:00.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.932
I have my service hours from the riot.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.643
They have me cleaning out
the old math book room.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.690
So, bye.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.861
-[chuckles]
-You can't have candles in here.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.945
This is a book room.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.906
Oh, they're prop candles.
There's no live flames.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.033
[sighs]

26:58.908 --> 27:01.745
OK, if I say yes, will this all stop?

27:02.162 --> 27:04.539
Yeah, that... that's the point of it.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.458
[Alex] So...

27:06.541 --> 27:07.584
[inhales slowly]

27:08.084 --> 27:08.918
...yes.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.379
-Yes, Charlie.
-[chuckles]

27:11.463 --> 27:15.383
Yes, Charles HaydenÂ Brixton St. George.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.177
I will go to prom with you.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.637
[chuckles lightly]

27:23.183 --> 27:24.851
[funky music plays]

27:28.730 --> 27:31.816
I just...
I feel like I should stay home with you.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.235
Dude, it's your senior prom.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.780
Are you sure you can't come
for a little bit?

27:36.863 --> 27:38.239
Charlie got an eight-person limo.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.034
Is it somewhat gay
that you're going with the two of them?

27:42.160 --> 27:46.039
OK. A, so what if it were?
Would you love me any less?

27:46.122 --> 27:48.249
And B, it's actually
sort of the opposite of gay

27:48.333 --> 27:50.043
because Alex asked me to tag along

27:50.126 --> 27:52.212
'cause I think he's afraid
Charlie's gonna make a move.

27:52.295 --> 27:54.964
Mm. Yeah. He is super known for his hands.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.341
So, there you go.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.760
[Justin] Yeah, no,
I don't really feel like it,

27:58.843 --> 28:02.389
and I can't manage
to give a shit about the whole thing.

28:03.890 --> 28:04.724
[clears throat]

28:07.310 --> 28:09.104
Jess is going with Ani, right?

28:10.146 --> 28:10.980
Yep.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.524
[Justin] What about, um...

28:12.941 --> 28:13.817
Diego?

28:14.317 --> 28:16.194
With the football guys, all solo.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.155
Diego's got no date?

28:19.572 --> 28:21.241
I thought you didn't give a shit?

28:22.492 --> 28:23.535
Justin,

28:23.618 --> 28:24.786
come on, just go.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.248
[coughs, groans]

28:30.625 --> 28:32.377
[horn beeping outside]

28:32.711 --> 28:33.712
[sighs]

28:33.795 --> 28:35.213
Dude, I'm worried about you.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.134
Yeah, I'm worried about me too.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.765
[Clay] If you need anything,
Dad's in the house.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.363
[door opens, closes]

29:00.905 --> 29:02.490
[dance music plays]

29:06.661 --> 29:08.121
-Wow.
-[Charlie chuckles]

29:08.496 --> 29:09.497
This is...

29:10.415 --> 29:11.249
a lot.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.376
I'm actually borderline impressed.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.837
Yeah, Jessica Davis does not fuck around.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.213
No, she doesn't.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.758
Oh, my God.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.802
You all three should get married.
As a poly thing?

29:23.470 --> 29:26.639
I don't mean that
in any sort of insensitive, assuming way.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.392
I just think you all three look adorable,

29:29.476 --> 29:31.269
and I never say that about Clay.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.396
-That is true. You don't.
-Mm.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.689
You guys look great.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.149
You should be prom queens.

29:36.232 --> 29:39.277
Not a chance. They always vote
for whoever the football team wants,

29:39.360 --> 29:41.279
and that is definitely not me.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.240
Well, the monarchy is
an outdated establishment anyway.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.742
And besides,

29:45.825 --> 29:48.787
I think we have some competition
for the hottest couple right here.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.622
I only came because he made me.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.542
I'm trying to get him to act his age
because you only get one high school prom.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.336
Well, you get two, apparently.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.755
Well, let's fucking enjoy it.

29:58.838 --> 29:59.839
Shall we?

30:03.593 --> 30:04.844
Hey, guys! What's up?

30:04.928 --> 30:05.887
Hey.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.139
We're all at the same table
down that-a-way.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.600
I ate all the dinner rolls
'cause I gotta get some food in.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.477
This is Presmella.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.562
-Presmilla.
-Presmilla.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.815
-[Presmilla] Hi!
-Going to the bathroom

30:17.315 --> 30:18.274
to do coke.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.193
That is a true story.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.487
Hoo!

30:26.991 --> 30:27.867
Is she...?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.077
Did he bring...?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.246
That is definitely a hooker.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.377
You don't need to get my chair for me.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.170
I'm getting your chair.
It's what people do.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.463
OK. Thank you.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.843
Looking sharp, everyone.

30:45.593 --> 30:48.304
Food is great, by the way.
Chaperones ate early.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.515
Deputy Standall,
it's good to see you, sir.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.643
-We, uh, promise to behave.
-[Alex] Wait, we do?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.104
-[chuckles]
-Well, you won't even dance.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.897
Wait, kid, you won't dance?

30:57.981 --> 31:00.859
There's no teaming up on Alex, OK?
That's the rule.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.779
Clay, it's good to see you here.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.407
Yes, sir.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.993
Hey, thanks for your help with...

31:10.451 --> 31:11.953
uh... all that

31:12.036 --> 31:14.247
after, you know, everything at school.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.665
[Bill] Hey, no help from me.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.793
Sheriff Diaz is really looking out
for you kids.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.341
When he says shit like that,
it almost always goes wrong.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.595
Foundry's right over there.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.810
Does anyone feel
like we're still under surveillance?

31:40.398 --> 31:42.775
[indistinct chattering, laughter]

31:42.859 --> 31:43.860
Can we talk?

31:45.820 --> 31:47.488
Sure. We can talk right here

31:47.864 --> 31:49.282
in front of my friend Ani.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.283
Hello.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.620
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

31:53.703 --> 31:54.829
[Jess] I don't either.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.581
I love when we agree.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.418
I miss you.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.837
Oh, and we stop agreeing.

32:05.131 --> 32:08.092
Um... I, uh... I came alone tonight.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.095
And you'll leave alone.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.473
We had something, Jess.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.600
We... We have something,

32:17.018 --> 32:19.979
and if you don't want
to tell me your secrets, that's OK.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.440
I'll protect you.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.025
We having fun yet?

32:24.567 --> 32:26.110
They're serving the main course.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.196
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.907
Diego was just going back to his table.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.410
Enjoy.

-Presmilla.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.611
Oh, yes.Â Bismillah,
that's, uh, "Bohemian Rhapsody."

33:08.695 --> 33:10.238
-Yeah.
-You can see my confusion, though.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.781
-Yes.
-Where is she?

33:12.156 --> 33:14.117
Bathroom, again. She goes a lot.

33:14.617 --> 33:18.121
Zach, you brought a hooker to prom,
and she's probably a drug addict.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.165
She is an escort who is escorting me,

33:21.249 --> 33:24.627
and she drinks a lot of water
'cause she doesn't eat, so she pees a lot.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.796
That's your idea of a good time.

33:26.879 --> 33:27.839
[scoffs] Is this?

33:27.922 --> 33:30.258
You guys are sitting here
like it's a fucking funeral.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.719
Aren't you gonna try
to convince yourselves you're having fun?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.847
I put a lot on the line for this,
and I'm going to have a good time.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.223
If it kills you.

33:37.306 --> 33:38.224
Yeah.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.231
[Alex] Are we ever gonna feel OK?

33:46.107 --> 33:47.984
Like, normally OK, ever?

33:49.485 --> 33:53.156
I haven't felt normally OK
in a long, long time,

33:53.948 --> 33:56.409
but I'm going to find ways to be happy.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.038
[jocks laugh]

34:03.624 --> 34:05.835
[sighs] I don't see that happening for me.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.884
He should be here.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.595
He should be alive.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.430
He'd be drunk.

34:19.015 --> 34:21.184
He'd be choosing his next victim

34:21.684 --> 34:25.354
and making you feel poor and lame
and not a man.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.355
I'm not a man.

34:26.439 --> 34:27.815
That's bullshit.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.150
He didn't deserve to die.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.321
No.

34:34.989 --> 34:35.990
No, he didn't.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.077
But neither do we.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.289
And this, this isn't fucking living.

34:43.372 --> 34:46.542
He ruined our fucking lives,
all three of us.

34:46.834 --> 34:49.587
So, no, he didn't deserve to die,
but we deserve to live.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.424
So...

34:53.883 --> 34:57.011

I'm gonna go dance with a whore.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.680
-I'm having a good time.
-Yeah?

35:41.097 --> 35:41.973
Yeah.

35:53.442 --> 35:56.696
I'm... I'm a high school senior, you know?
Like, I...

35:57.113 --> 35:58.781
There have been moments
these past few years

35:58.865 --> 36:01.826
when I forgot about high school
altogether, and I just...

36:03.911 --> 36:05.580
I mean, it's been a crazy ride...

36:06.664 --> 36:07.957
and... and horrible,

36:10.042 --> 36:11.043

36:13.171 --> 36:14.630
kind of amazing.

36:16.883 --> 36:21.470

in a way that I never thought I would.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.569
Why'd you do it? Why'd you cover for them?

38:00.945 --> 38:02.488
You weren't even a part of it.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.198
I was, though.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.951
And I'll tell you this.

38:07.868 --> 38:11.080
I came to this town,
and I got to know all of them,

38:11.163 --> 38:14.083
and they were fucked up and messy

38:14.667 --> 38:15.835

38:17.086 --> 38:18.713
and I loved them right away.

I promise you.

49:34.638 --> 49:37.641
âª You know that I see it... âª

49:39.434 --> 49:40.978
I love you more than life.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.066
Don't love anything more than life.

49:48.944 --> 49:49.861
OK.

49:54.616 --> 49:56.910
You better hold me,
and don't ever let me go.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.080
Yeah, OK.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.920
âª Best partÂ âª

50:07.004 --> 50:09.006
âª It's the sunriseÂ âª

50:10.007 --> 50:12.426
âª And those brown eyes, yes âª

50:13.427 --> 50:17.681
âª You're the one that I desireÂ âª

50:19.725 --> 50:21.727
âª When we wake upÂ âª

50:22.728 --> 50:25.230
âª And then we make love âª

50:26.314 --> 50:30.527
âª It makes me feel so niceÂ âª

50:31.611 --> 50:34.781
âª You're my water
When I'm stuck in the desertÂ âª

50:34.865 --> 50:38.160
âª You're the Tylenol I take
When my head hurtsÂ âª

50:39.077 --> 50:45.167
âª You're the sunshine of my lifeÂ âª

50:45.250 --> 50:50.797
âª I just wanna see
How beautiful you are...Â âª

50:51.715 --> 50:53.425
Are your feelings mixed like mine?

50:57.804 --> 50:59.765
I don't know what that kind of love is.

51:00.182 --> 51:01.224
I've never felt it.

51:03.435 --> 51:04.519
Sorry. I...

51:04.603 --> 51:05.437
Don't be.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.272
I know where I stand.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.068
Look, when we were together,

51:13.278 --> 51:15.030
I wasn't ready for a relationship.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.408
I didn't know how to be in one.
Still don't.

51:19.701 --> 51:22.579
You know, I think you have this ideal

51:23.205 --> 51:24.664
of what a girl should be,

51:25.082 --> 51:26.249
and you pushed me away

51:26.333 --> 51:29.294
when I turned out
to be something different.

51:30.879 --> 51:33.882
But the truth is
no one could ever live up to that ideal,

51:35.550 --> 51:37.511
and to be fair,
I don't have a fucking clue

51:37.594 --> 51:39.429
how to be in a relationship either.

51:40.180 --> 51:44.017
How to love someone
without... having to take care of them.

51:44.559 --> 51:45.519
So...

51:48.188 --> 51:49.064
friends?

51:50.816 --> 51:51.691
Friends.

You?

52:14.589 --> 52:15.465
No.

52:26.935 --> 52:28.979
I would have thought
you'd be here with her tonight.

Yeah, it was, uh...
unexpected to us too.
