our characters

47:45.228 --> 47:47.099

whether to go to Meridian

51:04.688 --> 51:07.125
he's been on a journey
to try to redeem himself,

I mean, this is not a person who
is, by any means, perfect.

I think there's
a lot of times that he is

even still in a villainous area.

been privy to a lot of that.

him is stuck back when

as a vigilante, take him out.

to rot in jail.

I think she recognizes,

very reluctantly,
that this is a person who is

51:52.214 --> 51:54.999

a time to try a split screen."

these kind of odd clues

is both like and unlike

The final scene
with Negan and Maggie --

54:31.808 --> 54:35.290
I think we were really
interested in the idea of just

54:35.333 --> 54:40.382
pushing the conflict between
them as far as possible.

54:40.425 --> 54:42.558
Negan -- that guy's a survivor,

54:42.601 --> 54:45.778
and if he thinks somebody
is out to kill him,

54:45.822 --> 54:48.955
then, you know, I don't know
that he's actively trying to

54:48.999 --> 54:52.002
get rid of her, but he's an
opportunist, as well,

54:52.045 --> 54:56.006
so he sees this opportunity
to just not help,

54:56.049 --> 54:58.617
even if that effectively means
he's okay with

54:58.661 --> 55:01.490
letting her fall to her death,
possibly.

55:01.533 --> 55:05.711
For us, it was always about
this character moment

55:05.755 --> 55:07.583
of these two people that
hate each other

55:07.626 --> 55:09.019
and don't trust each other.

55:09.062 --> 55:11.326
And when you're
in an extreme situation,

55:11.369 --> 55:14.851
do you step up
and help unexpectedly,

55:14.894 --> 55:17.157
which is usually, like,
what we see our characters do,

55:17.201 --> 55:18.550
or do you let kind of, like,

55:18.594 --> 55:20.552
the worst version of
things happen?

55:20.596 --> 55:22.206
We just thought
that it was interesting

55:22.249 --> 55:23.381
to push them to that point.
