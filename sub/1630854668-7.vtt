00:38.204 --> 00:39.664
<i>This is Bob Goodwin.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:41.708
<i>Low-level player out of Philly</i>

00:41.791 --> 00:44.878
<i>with a rep for cracking safes</i>
<i>and tripping over his own fists.</i>

00:44.961 --> 00:47.088
Hothead with a taste for chaos.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.966
The Diamond Way score
feels a lot like Bob.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.302
Big ambition, sloppy performance.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.723
My theory is that the Diamond Way heist
funded another operation,

00:56.806 --> 01:00.435
the SLS robbery that was pulled off
by the very same crew.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
Along with Bob, his wife, Judy Goodwin,

01:04.147 --> 01:06.691
Ava Mercer, Stan Loomis,

01:07.484 --> 01:09.819
RJ Acosta, and…

01:11.988 --> 01:15.617
Ray Vernon AKA Leo Pap,

01:16.659 --> 01:18.995
<i>the mastermind of the operation.</i>

01:19.537 --> 01:22.040
<i>If Bob is oil, Leo is water.</i>

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
Cool, calm, precise.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
Oh, shit.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.713
<i>The ringleader</i>
<i>with one hell of a past,</i>

01:29.464 --> 01:31.925
<i>including multiple accounts</i>
<i>of grand larceny,</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:34.969
<i>wire fraud, arson, and manslaughter.</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:39.224
I believe that four weeks
after the jewel heist at Diamond Way,

01:39.307 --> 01:41.643
this crew cracked the vault at SLS.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.062
The most secure private vault
in New York City,

01:44.145 --> 01:45.230
maybe even the world.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.483
<i>Billions of dollars</i>
<i>in unsecured bearer bonds</i>

01:48.566 --> 01:50.235
<i>disappeared that night,</i>

01:50.318 --> 01:52.153
<i>and we have no idea where they are.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:56.116
<i>What we do know is we have multiple bodies</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:59.577
<i>and a crew that vanished into the night</i>
<i>and is still off the grid.</i>

02:00.620 --> 02:03.289
And now the victims, The Triplets.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.086
Stefan Thiele, Suzanne Grosvenor,
and Cho-Young Woo.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.381
Bankers who've been keeping assets
inside the vault.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.050
One week after the SLS operation,

02:14.134 --> 02:15.927
The Triplets filed insurance claims

02:16.010 --> 02:18.388
based on the bonds
they lost during the robbery.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.516
Unfortunately, they've been
reluctant to speak with us.

02:21.599 --> 02:26.896
And finally, Graham Davies,
AKA Roger Salas,

02:27.480 --> 02:30.859
owner at SLS
and the man whose vault was cracked.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.528
Currently serving time for grand larceny,

02:33.611 --> 02:36.239
identity theft, and murder.

02:37.782 --> 02:41.161
I want to know how this crew got away
with the heist of the century.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.956
I want to know who got rich
and who got screwed.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.471
<i>This is an automated call</i>

03:00.555 --> 03:02.515
<i>from the Washington Correctional Facility.</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:04.934
<i>Your request to visit prisoner number…</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:10.565
<i>21800-905.</i>

03:10.648 --> 03:12.609
<i>…has been approved.</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:15.236
<i>Please arrive via</i>
<i>the southside visitors' gate.</i>

03:43.681 --> 03:45.433
Am I supposed to know you?

03:52.565 --> 03:53.566
What is that?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.586
<i>Hello, Graham. My name is Bob.</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:17.715
<i>I was part of the crew that hit your vault</i>
<i>and took everything you had.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:23.805
<i>My partners took my cut,</i>
<i>tried to kill me, stole my wife.</i>

04:24.389 --> 04:26.766
<i>They are living like pigs in the fat house</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:29.852
<i>while you rot in jail</i>
<i>and I suck ice cubes.</i>

04:31.562 --> 04:32.814
What do you want from me?

04:35.817 --> 04:38.903
<i>I want my share. I want my wife.</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:42.240
<i>Stake me 50K</i>
<i>and I will get your money back.</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:44.325
<i>We split two ways.</i>

04:46.077 --> 04:48.454
What the fuck am I going to do with money?

04:48.538 --> 04:49.998
I'm serving 20 years.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.626
You fetch me my fucking life back?
Can you do that?

04:54.752 --> 04:57.755
My wife, my kid, my company,
it's all gone.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.556
<i>There's one thing you can still get.</i>

05:08.224 --> 05:09.058
What's that?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.609
Revenge.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.410
-I will give you 20 grand.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.536
On one condition.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.049
<i>Kill Leo Pap.</i>

06:13.956 --> 06:16.459
<i>…last month,</i>
<i>we thought we'd be doing</i>

06:16.542 --> 06:19.420
<i>some cosmetic touch-ups</i>
<i>here and there, um,</i>

06:19.504 --> 06:22.423
<i>and a little bit of structural,</i>
<i>and now it's just gotten crazy.</i>

06:23.549 --> 06:26.511
<i>The house in its current condition</i>
<i>is down to the studs.</i>

06:26.594 --> 06:30.223
<i>We were able to open up the wall that we…</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:32.642
<i>It turns out that</i>
<i>that wasn't load-bearing.</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:35.019
<i>We have started framing, so then we can…</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:36.729
<i>Hey, Leo, it's Stan.</i>

06:37.438 --> 06:39.774
<i>I hope you pick up the phone</i>
<i>one of these days.</i>

06:39.857 --> 06:42.110
<i>Me and Jude are trying</i>
<i>to get out of the country,</i>

06:42.193 --> 06:43.778
<i>but we need passports and docs.</i>

06:43.861 --> 06:46.489
<i>We're running out of money.</i>
<i>I know you probably are too,</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:48.408
<i>but if we had any idea</i>
<i>where those bonds are</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:50.576
<i>that would be so helpful, you know. Bye.</i>

06:59.335 --> 07:00.294
<i>One, two…</i>

07:04.215 --> 07:06.050
That's it? Three lousy stacks?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.802
What the fuck? You kidding me?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.388
The fuck are we to do with that?

07:10.471 --> 07:13.808
Five covers the fake ID.
The rest ain't enough to dig graves.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.309
Wha…

07:17.228 --> 07:20.398
You come back with stacks,
and we'll hunt down whoever you want.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.108
Chop 'em up into little pieces.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.359
Cossack style.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.403
-Would you stop?
-What's your problem?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.405
No one even knows what that means.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.532
God forbid maybe they learn something.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.659
Cossacks were brutal as fuck.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.704
-Hey.
-What?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.747
Yeah, you mind?

07:37.498 --> 07:39.250
You need Bluetooths, motherfucker.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.501
-Blueteeth.
-What?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
Blueteeth! Teeth! Plural!

07:43.754 --> 07:46.132
-Yeah, teeth, plural.
-You say fucking "sheeps"?

07:47.592 --> 07:51.721
<i>I do the hunting.</i>
<i>I do the killing. You back me up.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:55.308
<i>When it's all done,</i>
<i>you get a cut of what I take back.</i>

08:00.688 --> 08:03.107
-How much you get out of that vault?
-Yeah.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.824
<i>Seven, zero, zero, zero,</i>

08:11.908 --> 08:17.622
<i>zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, ze--</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:22.960
This is a beauty, spicy notes of balsam,

08:24.295 --> 08:25.379
a kiss of saline.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.341
This one comes from Colares,

08:29.800 --> 08:33.346
where the vines grow in sand dunes,
dusted by sea salt.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.557
Can you taste it?

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
Hmm.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.227
I am there.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.562
That's a 1968 Adega Regional.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.855
What's your price?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.440
I only have one case left,

08:44.524 --> 08:48.444
so I could sell you three bottles
at 300 each?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.738
-How about 100?
-Beg your pardon.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.491
I couldn't help overhearing.
That's an Adega Regional?

08:53.574 --> 08:55.576
-Yeah.
-1968? May I?

08:56.494 --> 08:57.328
Um…

09:00.998 --> 09:03.167
I don't know how
you got your hands on a full case,

09:03.251 --> 09:04.794
but I'm sure it wasn't legal.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.964
Perhaps the real crime is wasting it
on Dicky Minibar over here.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.092
Excuse me, we are in the middle
of a private negotiation.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.885
I know. It's all right. Tell you what.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.097
I will pay you $200
to split this bottle with me right now.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.891
And $2,000 the whole case?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.935
$3,000 for the whole case.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.146
I…

09:24.897 --> 09:26.274
-Sold.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.985
As long as you write that shit
about the sand dunes.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.195
My buddy has a restaurant
up in Charleston.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.697
He'll put it on the menu.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.864
The menu?

09:36.534 --> 09:37.368
Uh…

09:38.828 --> 09:41.706
I'm so sorry, um, I don't think I can.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.964
Hey. Stan. What the fuck.
Come on, just get back here.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.841
-He was gonna sell it?
-Yeah.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.761
Some blue hair realizes they're paying
$300 for a glass of Two Buck Chuck.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.014
-How long before that rolls back?
-Stan, no.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.016
They taste
what you tell them to taste.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.601
That's not at all how wine works.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.935
Fix your accent, we'll be fine.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.563
I'm not criticizing your British
or whatever you're doing.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.068
RJ?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
What are you talking about?

10:17.408 --> 10:19.910
Jude, you all right?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.913
Hey, hey, hey.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.753
We're gonna be out of this soon.

10:28.836 --> 10:29.754
How?

10:29.837 --> 10:33.215
I called Leo.
All we have to do is sit tight.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.552
He's going to bring the passports,
the IDs, all of it.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.221
Did you actually talk to Leo?

10:42.266 --> 10:44.060
I left him a very potent message.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.146
No, look. He's not going to
leave us out in the cold, I promise you.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.064
Oh, Stan.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.317
It's not going to happen, okay?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.444
Your best friend isn't coming
to rescue you.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.237
You don't even know where he is

10:55.321 --> 10:57.740
or if he's been
screwing us this whole time.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.533
Welcome to the world of crime.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.663
Just fucking… cough up a nut sack
and pull your fucking weight.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.261
Come on, Mr. McCauley, knees up, way up.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.393
I didn't think
the flutter kick could get any worse.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.602
Could you wait in the lobby?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.771
I just want to see
how you're coming along.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.897
Ask Hot Tub Hitler.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.815
Excuse me?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.110
How is he doing?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.153
Healing is a journey, Mrs. McCauley.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.071
Fuck this.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.032
I'm done with this place.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.202
Never seen you as a quitter.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.664
Can't quit what's already over.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.710
When me and Cindy split up last year,

11:50.793 --> 11:54.839
it was like my whole world ended.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.759
I don't blame her.
I'm a tough guy to get along with.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.344
Wanna know how I got her back?

12:01.262 --> 12:02.138
Huh?

12:02.596 --> 12:03.556
Podcast.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.808
This lady Elena Stremlin,

12:06.308 --> 12:10.938
she's a couples counselor,
and it is some raw-ass shit.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.733
But I swear,
helped me patch things up with my girl.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.068
-You guys always seemed so stable.
-Thank you.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.571
-That's why I was so surprised…
-Yeah. Thank you.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.239
-…to hear that, you know…
-Thank you.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.658
-It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work…
-Yeah.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.660
-…but it's worth it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.497
Guy in the brown jacket?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.499
-Beige.
-Beige and brown are the same.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.169
-It's not.
-He's the fence.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.087
-He'll know where they are.
-It's brown.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.339
-How is that brown?
-Every time with you. Let me--

12:37.423 --> 12:38.257
It's like camel.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.892
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

12:47.975 --> 12:48.934
Fuck.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.075
I burned down my life for this.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.411
Barbara, Ma,

13:08.746 --> 13:09.747
the butcher shop.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.292
What would I go back to?

13:14.585 --> 13:18.422
I don't blame anybody for
the choices I made and the things I did,

13:19.465 --> 13:22.092
and if we make it,
I can live with all that.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.930
As long as I'm with you.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.891
If we have one more chance,

13:28.974 --> 13:31.060
let's not blow it on some short con.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.478
Let's go big.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.857
Some bank or some fancy jewelry store,
whatever. I don't care.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.194
Just… tell me what to do and I will do it.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.864
Let's start living our happy ending.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.372
How much do you think
we're going to need for our happy ending?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.124
A little goes a long way
down in Angangueo.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.378
Quarter mil?

14:06.637 --> 14:09.765
How much do you think
is the most I made off of a bank robbery?

14:10.891 --> 14:11.767
I don't know.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.394
About, um, 19K.

14:13.978 --> 14:14.812
Split two ways.

14:14.895 --> 14:19.191
So, until recently, the most we ever took
in one shot was $80,000

14:19.275 --> 14:21.861
and after the fence,
we cleared about a third, so…

14:25.614 --> 14:29.577
I don't know the first thing about
how to steal a quarter million dollars.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.471
You kept this?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.266
Go to that place on 3rd,
and don't take less than 2,000.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.851
It'll keep us afloat for a few weeks.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.977
And then what?

14:55.936 --> 14:58.188
Someone's got to hit
the Powerball.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.943
Did you keep this
because it came from him?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.951
Bob is the one thing
we don't have to worry about.

15:33.641 --> 15:37.269
What happened? Did he talk?
You get an address?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.111
Is he all right?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.658
So, where we going now?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.618
Bellefontaine, Ohio.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
Ohio? I fucking love Ohio.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.381
<i>Move, move! Ava! Ava, stop!</i>

16:05.464 --> 16:08.425
I said stop! I'm talking to you! Ava!

16:11.804 --> 16:15.140
I just got off the phone
with Stefan Thiele's legal team.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.352
Just had a couple more questions.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.021
You can't keep digging into The Triplets.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.273
They want to get
the Swiss government involved.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.650
Come on. They're posturing.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.778
-You're pushing on sensitive skin.
-That should tell us something.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.571
I can fund you two more weeks.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.157
Catch one of them, find the damn bonds,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.451
but knock it off with The Triplets.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.454
Go rogue again,
and I don't have to DR you.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.081
I'll just empty out your desk.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.173
It's a beauty, all right.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.760
I want my jewelry guy take a look.
He's not in till Monday.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.971
No, forget Monday. What can you do now?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.347
Maybe 500.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.807
Five hundred?

16:57.349 --> 17:01.562
You gave me 1,250 for the ruby ring.
That's got to be at least a couple K.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.106
Like I said, my jewelry guy.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.651
Why don't you leave your name and number?
I'll call when he gets back.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.071
See you Monday.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.824
You sure you don't want
to leave a number? Nothing?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.872
I didn't like the way
the guy at the pool was looking at you.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.584
We may have to move again.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.503
Georgia, maybe? Florida?

17:26.587 --> 17:30.090
-No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
-Okay. Yeah.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.553
Houdini's got nothing on you.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.849
-Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.351
Okay.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.063
Hey.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.861
Easy. Easy. Breathe deep.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.995
Figured it's time
we start talking about what comes next.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.999
Wait till I can stand up again.
Maybe take a piss.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.501
Our next job.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.462
We're two hours from Cincinnati.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.673
Second largest banking center
in the Midwest.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.844
Fourteen major vaults.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.057
How much can we get?

18:21.183 --> 18:25.145
Hmm. Say half a billion?
We'll need a crew.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.563
And someone on the inside.

18:30.692 --> 18:34.196
I'll hook a banker,
get him into a hotel suite,

18:35.072 --> 18:36.782
you snap a few pictures.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.910
Blackmail works wonders.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.411
What's the split?

18:42.579 --> 18:43.747
Down the middle.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.627
What are we doing, Ava?

18:48.710 --> 18:49.878
Don't stop.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.965
What do you want from me?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.099
I want Ray.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.768
Ray's long gone.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.064
You think that stack of letters
from your daughter

19:09.148 --> 19:10.232
might bring him back?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.694
You know, at some point,
you have to call her.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.198
Hey.

19:18.949 --> 19:23.787
I've known you long enough
to know you're better than this.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.672
-Don't answer it. No, Ava. It's…
-Yes…

19:37.301 --> 19:38.427
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Stan.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.430
Ava? Is Leo there?

19:44.099 --> 19:46.101
Why don't you talk to me?

19:46.685 --> 19:47.519
Okay.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.188
Um…

19:50.856 --> 19:52.107
I might have fucked up.

19:52.941 --> 19:57.029
I just tried to pawn something
from… somewhere,

19:57.112 --> 19:59.323
and I think
the broker might have clocked it.

20:00.115 --> 20:03.243
Can this something from somewhere
be tracked?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.245
Uh-huh.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.750
How do I reach you? No more cell phones.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.712
Oh, um,
you can call me at The Smashing Crab.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.132
Down the road from this lengua taco place
I go to all the time.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.218
<i>-They can get me a message.</i>
-Okay.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.386
<i>-Hey, Ava?</i>
-Hmm?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.389
How is he?

20:28.727 --> 20:29.937
He sends his love.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.572
<i>How can you say that?</i>
<i>I'm guilty of a lot. I'm owning that.</i>

20:40.656 --> 20:43.158
<i>But how can you sit there</i>
<i>and say I don't love you?</i>

20:43.242 --> 20:44.826
<i>Why do you hurt me?</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:47.496
<i>Okay, okay, time out.</i>
<i>This is the pattern.</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:51.124
You hear what she said there, bro?
Patterns. Patterns.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.210
You want to get Judy back,
you gotta break--

20:53.293 --> 20:56.338
Of course, he wants Judy back.
That's the idea of the conversation.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.049
It's a rhetorical question.
Stay out of this.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.177
You want to get Judy back,
you gotta break those patterns, my friend.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.763
-It's the only way forward.
-I got it.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.142
<i>If he can't get your attention</i>
<i>through connection,</i>

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
<i>he'll resort to destruction.</i>

21:10.602 --> 21:13.563
This lady's smart as shit.
I've been trying to tell you…

21:13.647 --> 21:20.362
<i>Dear Judy,</i>
<i>I want to be a better man.</i>

21:21.196 --> 21:25.867
<i>I want to put in the work</i>
<i>and break our patterns</i>

21:26.827 --> 21:30.831
<i>right after I kill Stan.</i>

21:41.174 --> 21:48.015
<i>Dear Judy, I want to be a better man.</i>
<i>I want to put in…</i>

21:52.519 --> 21:53.437
Abbasi.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.941
Where? Text me the address.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.697
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.700
Meet me at JFK in one hour.
We're going to South Carolina.

22:07.617 --> 22:11.580
"Judy, I want to take accountability
so that I can be with you again."

22:11.663 --> 22:14.791
"And smell you on my clothes
in the morning." What the fuck is that?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.461
That's a real thing. Odor transference.

22:17.544 --> 22:18.712
Fuck you talking about?

22:18.795 --> 22:21.423
Humans select mates
with similar body odors.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.134
It's a known fact.
And over time, they can blend.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.054
You and your known facts.
I have never smelled like Diane.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.931
You know who does smell like Diane?
Your mailman.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.184
-Give me that.
-I don't even have a mailman.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.395
"I want to learn
to let go of expectations."

22:35.479 --> 22:37.814
"Like when I assume
that just because I go down on you

22:37.898 --> 22:39.983
doesn't mean
that you have to go down on me."

22:40.067 --> 22:42.986
I mean, he's making a fair point.
It's really all about--

23:04.341 --> 23:05.509
Stan was right.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.304
Pawn shop guy tripped a wire.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.723
I'll tell Teresa to pack our things.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.690
FBI's heading down to Folly Beach.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.526
That means Abbasi.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.028
Stan and Judy have to get out of there.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.989
-Let's hope their luck holds out.
-Javier Zanetti is dead.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.826
-Someone got to your fence?
-Took it in his office yesterday.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.662
Zanetti had our address.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.290
I'll hit our safety deposit,
pull out whatever we got left.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.126
-We gotta hustle.
-Okay.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.632
-None of these people look familiar?
-Nope.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.884
And I didn't call in nothing.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.345
You like working under a lady?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.973
Excuse me? That's a federal officer.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.015
Oh, me too, buddy.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.854
There must've been someone else
who called it in yesterday?

23:58.937 --> 23:59.771
Guess so.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.732
-Does he have a name?
-No.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.278
He's the one guy on Earth
with no fucking name.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.363
-Wanna watch your mouth--
-That's okay. All right.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.282
Thank you, sir, for your time.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.493
And, uh, for your service. Thank you.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.622
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.172
-You shouldn't have to put up with that.
-Welcome to my world.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.717
We'll come back in the morning.
Other guy's on shift starting at 9:00.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.802
It was taped to the counter.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.929
Whoever tried to pawn it
will know where he got it,

24:33.013 --> 24:35.474
-and that guy will know where he got it.
-Yeah…

24:35.557 --> 24:37.017
Come on, let's get you a milkshake.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.187
Fine. A vodka rocks.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.980
Actually, I'd prefer a milkshake.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.944
<i>This couple has shown us</i>
<i>that contentment can take you a long way.</i>

24:48.028 --> 24:50.989
<i>Better to ask yourself,</i>
<i>"Let's see where this is going,"</i>

24:51.072 --> 24:53.658
<i>as opposed to "Am I there yet?"</i>

24:53.742 --> 24:56.203
<i>Well, that's all the time</i>
<i>we have for today.</i>

24:56.286 --> 24:57.829
<i>My name is Elena Strem--</i>

25:33.156 --> 25:35.325
-What's the matter, is it locked?
-It's locked.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.368
Fuck off.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.330
Cossack style.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.885
Shit!

26:26.209 --> 26:27.043
Come on…

27:38.823 --> 27:41.159
<i>Hello, Ava. Miss me?</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:43.703
<i>I stopped in to visit your pal Zanetti.</i>

27:43.787 --> 27:46.498
<i>Let's see if you answer questions</i>
<i>better than him.</i>

27:51.753 --> 27:55.882
<i>Want unlimited text-to-speech?</i>
<i>For just $3.99, upgrade to MacawPro,</i>

27:55.965 --> 27:59.094
<i>featuring voices for every personality</i>
<i>and every situation.</i>

28:00.095 --> 28:02.263
<i>We come from Planet Fun.</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:04.724
<i>I'm the rizzle-dizzle.</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:07.227
-<i>Better spill that tea, girl!</i>

28:07.310 --> 28:09.479
<i>Text it, talk it! Macaw it!</i>

28:12.148 --> 28:17.862
<i>Where is my wife?</i>
<i>Where is Stan? Where is my $100 million?</i>

28:19.531 --> 28:23.118
Do I look like I've got $100 million?

29:41.404 --> 29:43.239
Ah!

29:50.038 --> 29:53.249
She's got Vicodin, she got-- she got oxy.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.044
She got some of this Ap… Apokyn.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.337
She's got B12s.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.672
It's like a walking pharmacy
around here, man.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.682
Where's Leo?

30:31.412 --> 30:33.998
Don't say a word.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.047
Wait…

30:42.924 --> 30:44.050
I'll call him.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.065
Bob.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.027
Hundred and seventy-seven thousand.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.864
That's all that we have left.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.875
<i>And the bonds?</i>

31:16.958 --> 31:18.084
We don't have them.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.879
That money right there?
That's everything, Bob.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.341
For everyone. Meant to pay for new papers,

31:25.425 --> 31:27.552
passports, to get us out of the country.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.307
Take it. It's yours.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.519
<i>Where is Stan?</i>

31:37.896 --> 31:40.690
It's never really about the money, is it?

31:42.108 --> 31:43.401
<i>Where is my wife?</i>

31:43.484 --> 31:44.652
Forget about them.

31:46.529 --> 31:47.864
Oh, come on, man.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.950
Let it be. Judy made her choice.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.541
She chose wrong.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.214
You got so much hate inside you.

32:06.507 --> 32:09.218
I mean, it ain't wrong.
It just ain't a way to live.

32:11.012 --> 32:16.225
Your wife is gone and she gonna be gone,
no matter what you do.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.937
You know it, and I know it.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.731
Right now, you're a ghost.

32:23.191 --> 32:27.320
She thinks you're dead.
So stay dead. Start over.

32:36.537 --> 32:41.834
<i>Your choice.</i>
<i>Stan and Judy, or Ava and Grandma.</i>

32:49.050 --> 32:52.595
All right. You win.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.014
They're in South Carolina.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.396
<i>Set up a meet.</i>

33:02.647 --> 33:05.483
She's got a little black book
with numbers in it. Coded.

33:06.067 --> 33:06.985
Check her purse.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.367
This?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.165
<i>Tell them</i>
<i>you're bringing money.</i>

33:31.342 --> 33:34.095
Once a butcher, always a butcher.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.984
Hey. It's Leo.
I got your money and I'm coming to you.

33:48.067 --> 33:51.237
Meet me at The Smashing Crab,
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.656
Beachside. Later.

34:01.456 --> 34:05.376
<i>If I don't call</i>
<i>by 10:15, shoot the women first.</i>

34:05.460 --> 34:06.753
<i>Make him watch.</i>

34:06.836 --> 34:09.047
Graham Davies says hi.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.619
What the fuck.

35:06.187 --> 35:09.899
<i>That does it. I don't want</i>
<i>that vicious dog in this house.</i>

35:10.483 --> 35:12.819
You shouldn't
have made that phone call.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.612
It felt like the only smart move.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.283
When's the last time
we made a smart move?

35:21.953 --> 35:25.998
Yeah. We did some shit, didn't we?

35:26.082 --> 35:29.210
We definitely did some shit.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.054
I'm not going anywhere.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.934
Not while you're tied up anyway.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.521
We've done that, too.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.988
<i>It's 9:40 in Folly Beach,</i>
<i>and you know what that means?</i>

35:57.071 --> 36:01.075
<i>We're 20 minutes out</i>
<i>from our Kenny Rogers Roast, our non-stop…</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:03.786
For the love of God,
we are gonna be late, come on.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.746
It takes as long as it fucking takes!

36:05.830 --> 36:07.290
-Shut up in there!

36:07.373 --> 36:09.500
Come in here and make me.
I'll bite your balls off.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.587
-We gotta be there by 10:00.
-…wipe my ass all over you…

36:12.670 --> 36:14.964
I know where you live,
you old, mouthy fuck!

36:35.443 --> 36:39.280
Stan. Chill the fuck out, man.
Two minutes won't matter.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.708
Come on, Judy. Hurry up.
We're running late.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.921
Hi, please tell me
you still have the lengua.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.006
-We've still got the lengua.
-Thank God.

37:39.632 --> 37:43.594
You ran out by 10:00 last time.
Um, could I please have four?

37:43.678 --> 37:46.222
-No, uh, six. You want one?
-Yeah.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.766
Uh, eight. Eight tacos, please.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.577
Holy shit. That's Bob Goodwin.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.079
That's Bob?

38:10.162 --> 38:11.831
Jesus, he's covered in blood.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.836
-You said Leo was coming alone.
-That's what he said.

38:16.919 --> 38:20.298
He said, "It's Leo. I'm coming
with the money. Be at The Smashing Crab."

38:20.381 --> 38:23.718
-There's something in his jacket.
-Suspect is on the beach.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.053
Green jacket, black pants,
blood on the shoulder.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.054
Assume he's armed.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.019
Go.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.685
Goodwin!

39:18.147 --> 39:19.023
Oh, Stan…

39:36.290 --> 39:37.583
No!

39:39.835 --> 39:41.629
Everyone down!

39:49.678 --> 39:50.888
Nazan!

42:46.480 --> 42:48.857
<i>"The day is done</i>
<i>and rests its head."</i>

42:49.942 --> 42:51.902
<i>"The sea tucked softly into bed,</i>

42:52.903 --> 42:54.530
<i>and the tricky little squirrel,</i>

42:54.613 --> 42:58.367
she led the crew at the front of the boat
looking out to the sea,

42:59.243 --> 43:00.828
and as the clouds parted wide…"

43:16.302 --> 43:18.512
<i>Hannah, can you hear me?</i>

43:19.138 --> 43:22.266
Yeah, I… Okay. Wow. Hi.

43:22.349 --> 43:26.812
Thought I'd just try.
If it's an all right time.

43:26.895 --> 43:30.566
<i>Yeah, it's… it's good.</i>
<i>Um, I am just at home.</i>

43:31.150 --> 43:33.360
<i>I'm really glad you called.</i>

43:33.944 --> 43:36.572
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>my letters were coming through.</i>

43:36.655 --> 43:37.656
I wanted to see you.

43:38.782 --> 43:42.620
Let you know
that I was, uh, still out here.

43:44.204 --> 43:47.291
<i>Still going. And I also…</i>

43:52.212 --> 43:54.548
The things I should have said,

43:55.674 --> 43:57.885
<i>choices I made…</i>

43:59.053 --> 44:00.679
I did a lot of things wrong.

44:02.806 --> 44:05.309
But all of them, I wish,

44:07.269 --> 44:10.064
with you, I hadn't.

44:11.398 --> 44:13.942
It's okay. I'm good now.

44:14.818 --> 44:18.280
-Yeah?
<i>-Yeah, just taking it easy. It's…</i>

44:18.906 --> 44:21.742
It's quiet out here, you know,
it's just ocean and birds.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.577
I mean, you'd hate it.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.289
City girl needs some sirens
to keep her on her toes.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.628
<i>There it is. I… I'll let you be.</i>

44:32.711 --> 44:35.089
Please don't go.
Just one second. One second.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.555
<i>Hello. Say "Hi, Grandpa!"</i>

44:46.684 --> 44:48.143
There she is!

44:49.812 --> 44:50.979
I named her Lily.

44:51.563 --> 44:52.690
<i>Can you say hi, Lil?</i>

44:54.692 --> 44:56.360
She's gorgeous, Hannah.

45:00.280 --> 45:05.369
She looks brave, strong…

45:08.580 --> 45:12.543
And these guys,
they're just as crazy as ever. Oh.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.462
<i>Let Ava know they're good?</i>

45:19.425 --> 45:20.300
Sure.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.553
<i>Maybe come visit us?</i>

45:23.387 --> 45:24.555
<i>You know whenever you--</i>

45:24.638 --> 45:26.724
-I'd like that.
<i>-When it's possible.</i>

45:27.391 --> 45:31.145
I… I got some things I got to do first.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.439
<i>I just thought I'd…</i>

45:33.522 --> 45:34.815
You know, I thought I'd…

45:36.108 --> 45:40.362
start by saying hello.

45:41.572 --> 45:45.200
Well, okay then. Hello.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.762
Congratulations, agents.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.641
Did you actually read it? We got played.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.853
Goodwin's dead, Mercer's dead.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.272
Matter of time
before we track down the others.

46:15.355 --> 46:18.108
We recovered diamonds
from the safe in Zanetti's office.

46:18.650 --> 46:20.360
It all seems wrapped up to me.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.612
This is not over.

46:21.695 --> 46:24.823
Someone is getting away with… something,

46:25.741 --> 46:27.367
and we're still flailing around.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.078
If that doesn't bother you,
then I'm sorry,

46:30.162 --> 46:31.830
but I don't understand this job at all.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.042
That's what worries me.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.758
Let's call Stefan Thiele's office.

46:42.841 --> 46:45.052
We'll say Woo admitted
there was a break-in,

46:45.135 --> 46:48.096
-maybe she'll slip up.
-Nazan, it's over.

46:49.848 --> 46:52.643
Fine. Go. I'll call myself.

47:34.142 --> 47:37.271
I couldn't find the Italian beef
in the vending machine.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.791
Leo, is it?

47:58.917 --> 48:01.086
I've been warming up to Ray.

48:06.842 --> 48:09.428
A friend of yours
came by for a visit the other day.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.097
You won't be seeing him again.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.766
Too bad. He's a charming guy.

48:17.102 --> 48:19.271
You know, all I have to do
is just speak up,

48:19.354 --> 48:20.939
and you'll be here next to me.

48:22.232 --> 48:23.275
Go on, then.

48:24.484 --> 48:25.777
Just leave Hannah alone.

48:25.861 --> 48:28.113
Oh, fuck you for thinking I'd hurt her.

48:28.196 --> 48:29.740
Oh, more than you did already.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.536
You know how many years
I spent searching for her…

48:34.620 --> 48:36.413
-She wasn't yours to find.
-Maybe.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.626
I gave her something to reach for.
Something real.

48:41.752 --> 48:44.254
You hadn't turned up,
who knows where she'd be now.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.966
She doing good.
She found her way all on her own.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.804
So they gave me 20 years.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.807
My lawyer says I'll be out in eight.

48:58.143 --> 48:59.144
How long you looking at?

49:04.316 --> 49:08.528
You could have come in with me, Ray.
Would have been rich together.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.489
You need to be rich. I didn't.

49:10.572 --> 49:13.575
-Is that what you tell yourself?
-You took everything I had.

49:15.577 --> 49:19.790
So you spend 25 years
obsessing over how to get mine.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.252
-Fuck, Ray. Why?
-How about justice?

49:24.336 --> 49:25.629
I'm your excuse, Ray.

49:25.712 --> 49:29.591
I'm the guy you can blame for doing
exactly what you wanted to fucking do.

49:31.051 --> 49:31.927
You're a thief.

49:32.010 --> 49:34.930
You change your name, it doesn't matter.
It's what you are.

49:35.430 --> 49:36.848
For a while, I wasn't.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.267
Yeah, maybe for a little.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.731
So, here I am.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.609
All busted up and put away, and you're…

49:49.903 --> 49:50.904
So was it worth it?

49:52.030 --> 49:52.864
Huh?

49:53.615 --> 49:55.242
All those fucking years.

49:57.119 --> 49:58.203
For this?

50:01.415 --> 50:03.333
Could you have saved her that night?

50:04.292 --> 50:06.128
Could you have saved Lily?

50:09.715 --> 50:10.716
I don't know.

50:18.223 --> 50:19.224
I don't know.

50:22.644 --> 50:24.813
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>when she'll be available?</i>

50:25.897 --> 50:27.524
No, you cannot get back to me.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.776
Tell your boss
she can stall as long as she likes.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.862
But I got questions, I'm not going away.

50:32.446 --> 50:33.447
Yeah. All right.

50:35.532 --> 50:39.453
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can get to the train station?

50:39.536 --> 50:40.537
Yeah. That way.

50:41.538 --> 50:44.583
Thank you very much.
I'm so thankful to be here.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.783
I've seen this before.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.244
This job can swallow you whole.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.081
Don't blame yourself.
