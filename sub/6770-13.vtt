WEBVTT

00:08.341 --> 00:09.467
Check this out.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.554
We get free coffee
from the java guy

00:12.637 --> 00:14.139
because he's got a crush
on Donna.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.223
Excuse me.

00:15.306 --> 00:18.810
So I have decided
that I am going to figure out

00:18.893 --> 00:22.439
exactly how much money
we're saving.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.442
Did I tell you
about the Bear case?

00:25.525 --> 00:28.069
Oh-oh!
The guy who had his idea

00:28.153 --> 00:29.070
about the theme restaurant
stolen.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.530
Yeah, he said it was a winner.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.115
It was, until he settled.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.950
Well, you'll get another case.

00:34.033 --> 00:36.453
Is Kelly mad at you
'cause I'm working here again?

00:36.536 --> 00:39.456
And now... and now he wants
his retainer back.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.457
See, he wants his money.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.791
Oh, you want me to work!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.918
Okay, I'll get
the check out today.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.629
I'd like that. That would...
that would be very good.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.631
But the thing is,
I don't have the money.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.633
I spent it
on Kelly's engagement ring.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.136
Oh... That was stupid.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.095
Gina, you don't understand.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.473
There are rules against
this sort of thing.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.265
Very enforceable rules

00:57.348 --> 00:58.475
with suspensions and fines
and...

00:58.558 --> 00:59.684
Right, right.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.311
Well, you didn't spend it all,
right?

01:01.394 --> 01:03.480
No, I have $700 left.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.607
-See? That's great.
-$700...

01:05.690 --> 01:07.734
Okay, out of how much?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.652
$15,000.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.697
Wow.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.330
Josie, hey.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.123
Hey, stay up there
with the group.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.585
I got some, uh, business
to take care of, okay?

01:32.425 --> 01:35.386
Hi. I'm Josie.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.222
Nice to meet you.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.556
Got a customer.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.151
NOAH:
Donna, hey.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.569
Hi.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.363
How you doing?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.615
Good.
I'm... I'm doing good.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.408
That's good.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.494
Who are these people
you're with?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.329
Ah, just some friends.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.665
Some people just showed up,
you know?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.252
Uh, Kelly's waiting for me,
so I should get back.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.670
Yeah. See ya.

02:09.753 --> 02:10.672
Bye.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.889
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.308
There's a cute boy at the bar.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.062
You, my dear, are engaged.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.106
I know, but you're not.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.567
Nice shirt, expensive shoes.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.734
Maybe doctor, lawyer.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.279
I'm happily single.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.905
Well...

02:35.989 --> 02:39.325
And from the looks of things,
so is Noah.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.203
Are you really happy?

02:42.287 --> 02:43.621
I think so. I mean,

02:43.705 --> 02:45.623
since Noah and I split up,
I've read four books,

02:45.707 --> 02:46.499
seen every
Alfred Hitchcock movie,

02:46.583 --> 02:47.417
learned who's running
for president,

02:47.500 --> 02:48.543
and started a new line
of sweaters, so...

02:48.626 --> 02:52.422
(laughs) You do have too much
time on your hands.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.591
I've realized that every time
I am with somebody,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.426
I always end up doing
what they want,

02:56.509 --> 02:57.927
taking on their needs.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.930
I mean, it's not their fault.
It's mine.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.892
But, right now, I'm just trying
to take care of myself.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.059
Starting to, at least.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.060
Feels good.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.312
Ladies.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.980
Oh, you know what?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.607
I think there must be
a mistake.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.442
I didn't order champagne,
did you?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.484
-Mm-mm.
-Compliments from the gentleman,

03:13.568 --> 03:18.448
as well as congratulations
on your engagement.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.742
Do you think
he's really happy for me?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.453
You mean, do I think he loves
you enough to let you go?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.579
I hope so.

Hey, Nat, can I get
a coffee to go?

05:21.696 --> 05:22.613
Sure.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.573
I'm glad you're here.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.242
We can just ride
over to the church together.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.077
You're awful peppy today.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.579
No, actually,
I'm a little nervous.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.539
I know today's just
the rehearsal,

05:31.622 --> 05:33.958
but I've never been a part
of a baptism before.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.668
NAT:
There you go.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.503
Coffee to go, eggs over easy.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.882
Ooh, no, we don't have time
for that.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.134
Yeah, well, luckily,
"we" aren't eating it.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.093
You are gonna take

05:44.177 --> 05:45.928
this godparent thing seriously,
aren't you?

05:46.012 --> 05:49.098
Yeah, you and me linked
for life, you bet.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.224
Nice rock.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
Do you want to talk about this?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.439
No, rather just drink my coffee.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.316
Because before Matt and I
announced our engagement,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.943
you said that you wanted
to tell me something;

06:01.027 --> 06:02.945
about how things could be
different for us.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.280
Do you want to tell me now?

06:04.363 --> 06:06.365
I think that would make us late.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.286
Fine.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.333
Hey. I am here
for my mystery fitting.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.127
Perfect, let me just grab
a measuring tape and a pencil.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.588
Hey, what's the deal with
you and the coffee guy?

06:20.671 --> 06:22.256
I told him I was
coming over here

06:22.340 --> 06:24.926
to see you, and he introduced
himself and wouldn't let me pay.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.928
Oh, Mark is just being nice.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.472
Well, Matt and Gina were in line
in front of me

06:29.555 --> 06:31.808
and Mark wouldn't let them
pay either.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.144
Arms out!

06:35.228 --> 06:36.145
(David chuckles)

06:36.229 --> 06:37.980
Donna, you're single.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.273
He seems like a nice guy.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.818
Am I missing out
on something here?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.946
No. I just don't feel like
dating anyone right now.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.448
I swear, that's why
women run the planet.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.283
Why? Because we don't feel
like dating someone?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.952
No, 'cause you guys are
like bears.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.162
You can just hibernate
for months at a time.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.831
Even years.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.207
I'm not gonna wait years.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.000
But you could, right?
That's my point.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.127
Women have all the power.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.380
You can pass up a great guy
and just wait forever.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.799
Look, I'm reading a few books,
catching up on some movies.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.509
That hardly constitutes
forever.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.677
Arms down.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.013
DAVID:
Thank you.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.516
I'm not gonna miss out
on anyone.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.395
I'm just waiting for, like,
a few weeks or a month or two.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.313
Whatever you say.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.318
You know, he does make
a good cup of coffee, though.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.783
(chuckles)

07:32.910 --> 07:36.330
The service is fairly simple.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.373
When everyone is gathered,

07:37.456 --> 07:40.710
I'll say a few words
of welcome, offer a prayer,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.503
and then ask Dylan and Kelly

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
to pledge their support
to Madeline

07:44.130 --> 07:45.047
throughout her life.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.425
A baptism initiates Madeline

07:47.508 --> 07:49.218
into her spiritual family.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.345
The church, you,

07:51.429 --> 07:52.513
Steve, Kelly and Dylan.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.099
And that's it...
for the ceremony.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.895
When the ceremony begins, Janet
will pass the baby to Dylan,

07:58.978 --> 08:01.731
Dylan will give her to me,
and I will formally baptize her.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.276
-Any questions?
-Yeah-- are we done?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.572
That's it.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.365
What?

08:11.449 --> 08:13.201
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.204
So, we're... we're cool?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.247
Yeah, we're cool. Thanks.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.251
What?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.462
I have an appointment.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.592
He's sorry, I think.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.219
(door opening)

08:31.302 --> 08:33.721
He's gonna do this, right?
Not just the ceremony,

08:33.804 --> 08:35.097
but he's going
to commit to this.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.140
(door closes)

08:36.224 --> 08:37.600
Well, he said he would.
We'll see.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.477
This isn't about you guys.
It's about me.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.811
Me being engaged,

08:40.895 --> 08:43.313
me committing to Matt
while he and I are

08:43.397 --> 08:45.233
committing to Madeline.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.443
There's a lot
of cross-committing going on.

08:47.526 --> 08:50.571
I hope that things get uncrossed
before the baptism,

08:50.655 --> 08:52.448
for Madeline's sake.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.410
Bye.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.496
Okay.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.209
(door opening)

09:03.292 --> 09:04.502
Come on.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.878
(door closes)

09:05.962 --> 09:08.965
MATT: <i> Dan, how you doing?</i>
<i>Matt Durning.</i>

09:09.048 --> 09:10.258
DAN:
Matt.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.259
The reason I'm calling is,

09:11.342 --> 09:13.344
I was just going over
some outstanding bills,

09:13.427 --> 09:15.304
and I noticed
that you still owe me $600

09:15.388 --> 09:17.265
for the work I did on your will.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.808
DAN: That was just
a couple of months ago.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.309
Yeah... two months.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.811
That's right. That's right.
Um...

09:21.894 --> 09:23.688
DAN: Times are tough,
Matt, you know?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.731
Well, times are tough,
I know, I know,

09:25.815 --> 09:27.275
but, uh, you know... (laughs)

09:27.358 --> 09:28.985
still need that money.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.236
DAN:
All right, well, listen,

09:30.319 --> 09:31.988
I'll send you a check
as soon as I can.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.114
MATT:
Well, when will that be?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.282
DAN:
Uh... next week?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.659
All righty.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.286
Is your little helper gone?

09:38.369 --> 09:39.495
Gina's gone home.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.330
-Good.
-Look,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.332
I know Gina's hurt you
and your family,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.001
but I think she's sorry.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.669
Not sorry enough.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.337
Can you just let it go?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.299
Okay, we've got
the south of France,

09:51.382 --> 09:53.968
the Caribbean and Tahiti.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.303
Kelly!

09:55.386 --> 09:56.971
Personally,
Tahiti is my favorite,

09:57.054 --> 10:00.349
but it is your honeymoon, too,
so I guess you get a say.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.019
You know what? Right now's
not really a good time.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.687
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nothing. It's...

10:04.770 --> 10:06.647
I thought
we were going small with this.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.065
Yeah, small, small.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.233
It's our honeymoon.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.943
Well, Big Sur is small.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.361
San Francisco, Mount Rushmore.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.487
(Kelly laughs)

10:13.571 --> 10:16.407
You want me to go to
South Dakota for my honeymoon?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.825
No. I just...

10:17.908 --> 10:20.369
I want to stay within a budget
on our honeymoon.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.330
-Oh.
-And on our wedding and in life.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.750
I want to set a budget,
and I just want to stick to it.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.002
Is that... You think
that's even remotely possible?

10:28.085 --> 10:31.380
Yes, I just... I wanted it
to be perfect.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.342
And it will be perfect.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.551
(Matt sighs)

10:35.634 --> 10:37.219
But can we talk
about this later?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.722
Sure. Matt?

10:39.805 --> 10:40.806
It's okay.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.481
(phone ringing)

10:48.564 --> 10:49.732
(sighs)

10:49.815 --> 10:51.192
Matt Durning.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.526
MAN:
Oh, hi, Matt. What's up?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.445
Hey, Kenny, thanks
for calling me back.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.072
Listen, it's, uh...

10:56.155 --> 10:59.909
I was actually calling about
the outstanding bill you have.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.370
(music plays inside club,
crowd chatter)

11:02.453 --> 11:05.122
♪ ♪

11:08.459 --> 11:10.127
You smell good, Josie.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.255
(both laughing)

11:13.339 --> 11:15.132
-Hey, classy guy.
-Huh?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.385
Sorry to interrupt
anatomy class.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.220
Where's Dylan?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.764
Right there.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.099
Why are you doing this?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.767
It tastes like strawberries.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.312
-Hey, so glad I found you.
-Hello.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.980
Have I ever asked
you for anything?

11:30.064 --> 11:31.232
-What are you talking about?
-Have I ever

11:31.315 --> 11:32.233
asked you for money?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.110
-Gina...
-I mean, every time

11:34.193 --> 11:37.321
you've ever offered me money,
I've always turned it down.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.781
Well, I've usually
turned it down.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.782
Yeah...

11:39.865 --> 11:41.242
-Am I right?
-You're right.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.618
Okay, it's just really
important to me

11:42.701 --> 11:44.245
that you know
that I would never, ever

11:44.328 --> 11:46.288
ask you for money
unless I really needed it.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.790
Well, I know that absolutely.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.625
You do really
know that for sure?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.252
'Cause I need $15,000.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.129
In trouble?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.297
No, I'm not in trouble.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.217
It's a guy who's being
really nice to me.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.304
(sighs)

12:02.388 --> 12:03.305
Cash or check?

12:03.389 --> 12:04.265
Check.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.692
So I saw Kelly
at the store today.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.154
She seems to be so excited
about the baptism.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.364
-Yeah, so she says.
-Ridiculous.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.159
You know, you've made it
pretty clear how you feel

12:23.242 --> 12:26.287
about me and Kelly-- our
involvement in this thing.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.038
I'm not talking about that.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.457
I'm talking about
the whole ritual.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.167
People standing above
a sweet little baby

12:31.250 --> 12:32.334
and making all these promises

12:32.418 --> 12:33.627
that they're never
going to keep.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.670
It's mean.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.630
You okay?

12:36.714 --> 12:39.550
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.179
Thanks.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.559
Such a shame about you.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.895
How's that?

12:50.978 --> 12:53.355
Just that, from afar, you seem
like such a catch, you know?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.024
You're cute,
you're rich, you're generous.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.694
Why is it that, up close,
you have to be

12:58.777 --> 13:00.738
such a bastard?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.991
Thanks.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.638
(door opening)

13:29.183 --> 13:30.559
DAVID:
Hey.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.561
Watch your step.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.231
Oh, man.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.900
Josie and Shane kept me up
most of the night.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.529
You know, Noah, when I said
you could crash here,

13:41.612 --> 13:44.865
I didn't mean
with your whole entourage.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.618
Driving was not an option.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.248
So who are these people?

13:52.331 --> 13:55.626
NOAH: That's funny-- Donna
asked me the same thing.

13:58.337 --> 14:03.259
David, look, I saw Donna
at the club and, um...

14:03.342 --> 14:04.927
(sighs heavily)
she didn't seem so happy.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.345
She's doing good.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.391
Good. Good.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.271
She's not seeing
anybody, is she?

14:15.354 --> 14:19.066
She's happy. Why don't we just
leave it at that?

14:19.149 --> 14:21.402
Right. It's cool.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.573
She is seeing somebody, right?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.826
I'm gonna take off.

14:28.909 --> 14:32.371
I'll take that as a yes.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.294
You know, Noah, you might want
to take a second and figure out

14:38.377 --> 14:41.422
if this is what you really need
right now.

14:48.887 --> 14:49.972
(door closes)

14:54.852 --> 14:56.478
Good morning.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.771
Hi.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.732
On Melrose and Fairfax

14:59.815 --> 15:03.944
there's this guy who usually
sells flowers.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.113
Apparently, he changed
his line of goods.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.907
Yeah, on the morning
I really needed a rose.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.618
Um...

15:10.701 --> 15:11.744
Sorry I snapped at you.

15:11.827 --> 15:12.661
But, uh,

15:12.745 --> 15:16.415
please, accept this citrus
as an apology.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.795
Thank you.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.342
I think Mount Rushmore
would be great.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.346
It would be good, but I think
Tahiti would be even better.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.890
Why do I feel like something
terrible is about to happen,

15:32.973 --> 15:35.351
and you know what it is,
but you won't tell me?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.519
Just work stuff--
nothing terrible.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.438
-You're sure?
-No.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.734
-I'll talk to you later?
-Okay.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.569
Enjoy that.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.279
Hey...

15:50.240 --> 15:51.575
Breakfast is on me.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.042
Hey.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.335
Hey, what's going on?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.879
-Want some?
-Uh, sure.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.381
Grab some off that.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.341
Thanks.
Something came for you.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.093
-What did?
-Right on the computer.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.436
Where'd you get this?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.355
Oh, that?

16:21.438 --> 16:23.232
I just, you know,
called in a few favors.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.733
Cashed in a few bonds.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.276
You cashed in a few bonds?

16:26.360 --> 16:27.111
Mm-hmm.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.738
I can't accept it, Gina.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.573
Oh, come on,
don't be such a superhero.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.575
You and I are the only
two people in this town

16:33.659 --> 16:35.411
who actually appreciate
the value of a dollar.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.416
(sighs):
Oy...

16:40.499 --> 16:42.918
Well, I-I don't know
what to say.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.253
Oh, just say thank you.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.713
Oh, you know

16:45.796 --> 16:47.089
-what you could say?
-Hmm?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.340
You could say

16:48.424 --> 16:51.218
no matter what people say
about you, Gina,

16:51.301 --> 16:53.262
you're really not such
a horrible bitch.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.098
Thank you.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.350
All right, you're welcome.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.190
(sighs)

17:07.818 --> 17:09.944
GINA:
That's cute.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.821
Yeah. I wanted
to show it to you.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.117
I was hoping you could wear it
to the baptism.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.743
Oh.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.787
I, uh... I'm not going
to the baptism.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.455
Why not?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.290
I can't believe
you're asking me that.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.541
(Donna sighs)

17:23.625 --> 17:25.294
You're invited, right?
I mean,

17:25.377 --> 17:26.670
if Janet and Steve didn't...

17:26.753 --> 17:28.547
No. They actually invited me.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.632
It doesn't have anything
to do with that.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.968
Do you really not know
what I'm talking about?

17:33.051 --> 17:36.346
Uh, sorry.
Um, this is a little itchy.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.514
Don't make me come in there.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.476
Know what?

17:40.559 --> 17:43.479
Your f...<i> our</i> father...

17:43.562 --> 17:46.148
he was also my godfather.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.649
That doesn't make any sense.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.026
Well, I guess

17:49.109 --> 17:51.320
it was his way
of trying to, you know,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.739
connect with me,
but not get too close.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.659
Well, I hope you know
I'm not talking to them.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.119
Yeah, I know.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.497
I'm sorry I keep giving you
reasons not to.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.208
(laughs)

18:04.291 --> 18:05.459
This is ridiculous.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.002
-(Gina laughs)
-(Donna gasps)

18:07.086 --> 18:08.170
I like that on you.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.171
Yeah?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.214
Thank you.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.673
Mm-hmm, it's nice.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.009
I'm gonna go.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.302
Oh, um,

18:15.385 --> 18:18.764
thanks for thinking of me
with the dress.

18:18.847 --> 18:19.807
Sure.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.770
So, Donna, the coffee guy there
gave me a free mocha

18:24.853 --> 18:26.188
with extra whipped cream today.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.024
And I told you I don't feel
like dating right now.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.859
Would you just throw Mark a bone
already?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.654
Come on. If you don't date him
soon, he's gonna go broke.

18:33.737 --> 18:34.905
(scoffs)
What if it's bad?

18:34.988 --> 18:36.156
So, move on.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.199
What if he's one of those guys

18:37.282 --> 18:40.035
that, like, licks his lips
before he kisses you?

18:40.118 --> 18:41.036
Okay, you know what?

18:41.119 --> 18:42.788
You're being ridiculously
nervous right now.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.206
Of course I'm nervous.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.041
I mean, haven't you watched
<i>Sex and the City?</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:48.377
It's a disaster out there, even
if you know what you're doing,

18:48.460 --> 18:51.755
which, from my past track
record, obviously I don't.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.007
Well, I mean,
present company excluded.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.093
You got to move on, all right?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.431
Why? Is that what Noah's doing?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.642
Would you stop asking
about Noah, okay?

19:03.725 --> 19:05.561
Forget about Noah. It's over.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.062
Great. So he is.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.397
(scoffs)
You know what...

19:08.480 --> 19:10.858
Donna?

19:10.941 --> 19:12.943
I'm gonna go get a refill.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.073
David, don't say anything

19:18.156 --> 19:20.200
to Mark about asking me out.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.001
(gasps)
Oh.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.381
(whispers):
I asked you not to.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.467
Not to what? I got a second cup.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.304
(Donna sighs)

19:41.972 --> 19:43.473
Hey, Donna.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.559
Hi.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.103
Oh. (laughs)

19:48.186 --> 19:50.397
Raisin scone, huh? (sniffs)

19:51.315 --> 19:53.692
Do you want to go out?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.491
Hey, hey, you want
French fries, order some.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.870
-I'm watching my cholesterol.
-Just one.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.246
Small one.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.957
So do you, uh...?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.376
You sure you're okay
with this godparenting thing?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.629
-Yeah, of course.
-Even though

20:13.712 --> 20:15.255
you'll be sharing
the responsibility with Kelly?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.924
Yeah, Steve, I-I remember.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.176
Well, it's just that
ever since she got engaged,

20:19.259 --> 20:20.260
you've been a little...

20:20.344 --> 20:22.471
I've been what? I've been fine.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.972
Look, this commitment
to Madeline

20:24.056 --> 20:25.140
is a lifelong responsibility.

20:25.223 --> 20:26.808
And if you're not

20:26.892 --> 20:29.019
up for it,
I want to know about it now.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.980
Steve, I drove up to Ojai
a couple weeks ago, okay?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.815
I read every book,
every pamphlet.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.317
-I went to a rehearsal.
-Yeah.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.652
All with an attitude.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.946
Look, I know
this whole thing is weird,

20:39.029 --> 20:40.864
everybody changing,
me married with a kid,

20:40.948 --> 20:42.407
Kelly moving on. It's...

20:42.491 --> 20:43.659
Change doesn't bother me, okay?

20:43.742 --> 20:45.327
Just get off my back
about this thing, man.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.704
I told you I would do it,
and that should be enough.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.706
Well, it's not, and you know it.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.377
You blow off the christening,
or do it halfway,

20:53.460 --> 20:56.672
I'll be off your back...
for good.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.595
(sighs)

21:08.433 --> 21:09.184
MARK:
Thanks.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.353
-The fish was really good.
-Mm-hmm.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.188
I can't believe
I've never had it before.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.690
I'm gonna have
to order that again.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.899
Monk... fish.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.484
It sounds like
something religious.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.237
You know, like
the Royal Order of Monkfish.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.905
(both laughing)

21:21.989 --> 21:24.032
That's a great jacket
you have on.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.158
Where'd you get it?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.702
It's funny. I don't remember.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.161
Oh. Well, I like it.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.413
Thanks.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.165
You know, guys never remember
where they get their jackets.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.042
I mean, I guess
that makes sense.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.544
'Cause, like, girls--
they never remember

21:35.627 --> 21:37.337
where they get their bras.
At least

21:37.421 --> 21:38.880
I don't. My friend Kelly

21:38.964 --> 21:40.465
always does, but...

21:40.549 --> 21:41.842
(both laugh)

21:43.343 --> 21:46.638
Mmm. Now, that's a fine cup
of coffee.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.100
I loved that movie.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.269
Me, too.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.229
Can never get enough
of that Matt Damon.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.565
-So I've heard.
-Oh, I mean,

21:56.648 --> 21:59.067
it's not like
he's my type or anything.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.527
Uh-huh.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.533
So, you-you read any good books
lately, or...?

22:15.333 --> 22:17.127
(sighs)

22:17.210 --> 22:19.254
Dylan, what can I get you?

22:19.337 --> 22:20.547
Nothing.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.049
NOAH:
You remember Shane and Josie?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.341
Yeah.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.260
Hey, charge me for a beer.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.929
Otherwise, it wouldn't count
as me buying you a drink.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.306
Hmm.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.807
Got a sec?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.934
Yeah.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.650
You're the only one I know
with cash like that.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.110
Well, Gina said

22:42.194 --> 22:43.612
someone was in trouble,
she just didn't say who.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.281
Yeah. First, of all,
I am not in trouble.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.574
Matt, you could have come
to me.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.575
Second of all,
I don't need your help

22:48.658 --> 22:49.576
buying things for my girlfriend.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.953
What are you talking about?

22:52.037 --> 22:53.830
Forget it.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.248
Well...

22:55.332 --> 22:58.001
Oh, the engagement ring.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.295
See, that's why
you're in trouble.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.964
No, I am <i> not</i> in trouble.
You got that?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.300
You got to admit, though,
either way, it's pretty rich.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.012
I mean, uh, me buying
your engagement ring for Kelly.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.473
I got to go.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.600
Kelly's waiting for me.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.436
Don't you just miss saying that?

23:29.407 --> 23:32.160
So, um...

23:32.244 --> 23:34.830
about that drink.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.998
Do you want
to go someplace else?

23:37.082 --> 23:40.168
I got someplace else in mind.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.009
(laughs)

23:55.392 --> 23:58.061
Hey, anything
in that wallet for me?

23:58.145 --> 24:01.022
Marcus, come up to my office.
I got a check for you.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.816
Great. For the full $15,000?

24:02.899 --> 24:05.402
Oh, I have $6,000

24:05.485 --> 24:08.155
for you today, and
I'll get you the rest next week.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.365
Whose retainer are you
dipping into this time?

24:10.448 --> 24:12.159
I'll have the money.
Now, come on.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.368
Let's go up to my office...

24:13.451 --> 24:14.703
Look, I got bills of my own.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.080
I'm talking a few days, Marcus.
Come on.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.250
Have I not given you
business and personal

24:20.333 --> 24:21.293
legal advice off the clock?

24:21.376 --> 24:23.170
I think I've been
a pretty good lawyer to you.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.880
Yeah, up until now.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.214
Do you want to know
what I spent the money on?

24:26.298 --> 24:27.841
I don't care
what you spent it on.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.259
An engagement ring
for my girlfriend.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.677
Look, what you did was wrong,

24:30.760 --> 24:32.888
and I resent you trying
to make me understand why

24:32.971 --> 24:34.973
you did it.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.524
Yeah, I know I'm late.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.611
I waited for 20 minutes,
then I went ahead without you.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.281
-Want to see it?
-Yeah.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.370
It's kind of girly.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.581
You said you wanted
to go in on a gift

24:59.664 --> 25:01.291
for Madeline together,
so I picked something.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.251
If you don't like it,
get something else.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.253
Come on.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.926
WOMAN:
Is, uh,

25:11.009 --> 25:12.385
-everything all right?
-DYLAN: Yeah.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.387
No. Maybe. Is this returnable?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.472
No, it's not,

25:15.555 --> 25:18.225
because it has Madeline's
initials engraved in it.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.936
Okay, then, do you have
any other christening gifts?

25:21.019 --> 25:23.230
Well, there's a whole section
over here. We have baby spoons

25:23.313 --> 25:24.439
and picture frames.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.734
It's okay. I'll show him.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.903
What bothers you more--
that I made a decision,

25:29.986 --> 25:31.112
or that it's permanent?

25:31.196 --> 25:32.405
I just don't like silver.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.283
I would have preferred a, uh,

25:35.367 --> 25:37.285
you know, simple gold band,

25:37.369 --> 25:39.287
especially on Matt's salary.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.455
Why are you trying
to ruin this for me?

25:40.538 --> 25:41.665
I'm not, Kel.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.041
Don't you see?

25:43.124 --> 25:45.293
I mean,
in some passive-aggressive way,

25:45.377 --> 25:46.628
I am trying to help you.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.088
Haven't you noticed

25:48.171 --> 25:50.048
Matt's acting
kind of weird lately?

25:59.224 --> 26:01.685
Well, he didn't go in
for the kiss good night,

26:01.768 --> 26:04.062
but I think it went well.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.981
-Did he say he'd call?
-No.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.274
But he's Mark, the coffee guy.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.984
He's 20 feet away.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.151
(laughs)

26:10.235 --> 26:12.153
What?

26:12.237 --> 26:13.697
Nothing.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.157
What? I'm listening
to your story about your date.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.326
You know, Donna, if this guy
doesn't follow through,

26:18.410 --> 26:19.786
it's really his loss.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.162
Nobody's losing yet.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.331
Why are you prepping me
for the worst?

26:23.415 --> 26:26.167
-He made me pay for my iced tea.
-What?!

26:26.251 --> 26:28.003
Yeah, he's been comping
everyone you know,

26:28.086 --> 26:30.547
and now, all of a sudden,
I'm out a buck, 95.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.798
Oh, that's bad.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.091
He made you pay?!

26:33.174 --> 26:34.342
Yeah.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.303
Well, at one point,
he did get really quiet.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.471
I just can't remember why.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.349
Oh.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.225
Oh...?

26:43.476 --> 26:44.686
How bad?

26:44.769 --> 26:46.187
After dinner, on the way home,

26:46.271 --> 26:48.189
we were driving past
a movie theater,

26:48.273 --> 26:49.316
and I made a comment

26:49.399 --> 26:52.152
about how incredibly sexy
I think Bruce Willis is,

26:52.235 --> 26:54.237
even <i> with</i> his receding hairline.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.613
Donna, you said...?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.700
DONNA:
What are the chances

26:58.783 --> 27:00.577
he's secure about going bald?

27:00.660 --> 27:03.371
Probably about the same as us
ever getting free coffee again.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.884
Hi.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.010
Hey.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.221
I was surprised to hear
that you'd gone home for lunch.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.389
Yeah, well, it's been slow.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.558
I thought I'd work
out of the house.

27:23.641 --> 27:24.726
Want one?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.019
Yeah.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.270
Saves on dining out, too.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
No, no, no.
It hasn't come to that.

27:29.939 --> 27:33.193
I saw Dylan this morning.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.861
Dylan.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.614
He was talking
about my engagement ring.

27:37.697 --> 27:41.618
Guy is such a... pal.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.999
I was short of cash,
Gina knew it,

27:48.083 --> 27:49.751
she went to Dylan for a loan,

27:49.834 --> 27:51.586
and that's how
he knows about it.

27:51.669 --> 27:53.963
I knew I was gonna propose, but

27:54.047 --> 27:57.258
I hadn't decided
on that particular ring

27:57.342 --> 28:00.053
until I got a large retainer
from a client.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.513
And that's how you paid for it?

28:01.596 --> 28:02.889
Yeah.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.266
-Is that a problem?
-The case

28:05.350 --> 28:07.268
didn't move ahead,
so I didn't do the work.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.270
Which means...

28:09.354 --> 28:12.107
(chuckles) the money wasn't
mine, after all.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.441
How much money do you need?

28:13.525 --> 28:14.818
It's beyond that.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.319
It's an ethics violation.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.113
The client notified
the Bar Association.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.782
Now I got to deal with them
first thing tomorrow.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.661
-What are you doing?
-I want you

28:24.744 --> 28:26.121
to go to that meeting
with a check.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.622
No, no, no.
Listen to me.

28:27.705 --> 28:28.998
This ring is from me;

28:29.082 --> 28:30.500
the promise to wear it forever

28:30.583 --> 28:31.751
is from you.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.586
A ring doesn't change
that promise.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.130
I want to return it.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.173
-No.
-I want to help you.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.299
Please let me.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.346
(sighs)

28:48.768 --> 28:50.562
Hi. Busy day?

28:50.645 --> 28:52.147
It's okay.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.315
Oh. Well, listen,

28:54.399 --> 28:56.526
I was just wondering if
you had a good time last night.

28:56.609 --> 28:58.945
And I'm only asking
because I had a good time,

28:59.028 --> 29:01.489
and... well, I don't think
you should let one silly remark

29:01.573 --> 29:03.032
get in the way of that.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.577
I appreciate your saying that.

29:06.744 --> 29:08.663
Look, I feel like an idiot.

29:08.746 --> 29:11.499
I'm... trying to apologize
for what I said.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.334
Please don't take it personally.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.712
I think you can understand
why that's difficult.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.298
Well, i-if you thought
I was being critical, sure,

29:18.381 --> 29:20.008
but I wasn't,

29:20.091 --> 29:22.385
so... you shouldn't...
you know, uh,

29:22.469 --> 29:25.847
take it personally, because--
and I completely mean this--

29:25.930 --> 29:28.766
I find bald men very... sexy.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.185
You think I'm going <i> bald?</i>

29:30.268 --> 29:33.521
No! Uh, w-well... aren't you?

29:36.274 --> 29:38.193
Whatever gentle recession
has occurred

29:38.276 --> 29:40.236
has been treated and reversed.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.281
Oh. So, then that comment
I made about Bruce Willis...

29:47.243 --> 29:48.495
Smell this.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.541
Well, it's a little strong
for my tastes, but... (laughs)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.126
(inhales)

29:56.127 --> 29:57.253
(exhales)

29:57.337 --> 29:59.380
Seven months.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.757
Seven months?

30:00.840 --> 30:03.510
Seven months is how long
I lived in Ziwataneo

30:03.593 --> 30:05.261
refining my special blend.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.264
Seven months
of tortillas and beans.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.351
Seven months to bring you
what I call

30:11.434 --> 30:15.355
a peak coffee experience.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.608
But...

30:18.691 --> 30:21.236
it's a little strong
for your tastes.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.278
Oh...

30:22.362 --> 30:23.363
(groans)

30:23.446 --> 30:27.200
Last night, I said
someone else's coffee was great.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.577
"Now,<i> that's</i>
a fine cup of coffee."

30:29.661 --> 30:31.371
Right to my face.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.624
Right to my bald face.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.087
You know what?
Maybe I didn't get a good whiff.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.547
Peak...

30:40.630 --> 30:43.049
coffee... experience.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.134
I'm sure if I just...

30:46.219 --> 30:47.303
Peak.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.273
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

30:58.356 --> 31:00.316
Shh. Shh.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.193
-Oh, shh.
-(laughing)

31:02.277 --> 31:03.236
Keep it down, guys.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.238
You're killing me.

31:05.321 --> 31:08.366
Hey, Dylan thinks
you're really cute. Go.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.290
(laughs)
Whoops.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.084
(clears throat)

31:18.167 --> 31:19.252
I'm back again.

31:19.335 --> 31:20.253
Want some company?

31:20.336 --> 31:21.629
DYLAN:
Actually, uh...

31:21.713 --> 31:24.090
That's my brother, Shane.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.301
That's, uh, Mitzy.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.969
Quinto.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.971
Alicia.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.307
-George.
-SHANE: Check it out, man.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.309
-(light knocking on door)
-Hey!

31:34.392 --> 31:36.185
DYLAN:
Whose idea is this?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.271
She's not looking
for a ring, man.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.814
Know what I'm saying?

31:39.897 --> 31:42.108
(sighs)

31:42.191 --> 31:44.485
NOAH:
Put on something good, will you?

31:44.569 --> 31:46.821
-(knocking on door)
-(Dylan groans)

31:46.904 --> 31:49.032
(music begins playing)

31:49.115 --> 31:49.991
Hi.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.493
GINA: Well, those
look like nice girls.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.995
Are they yours?

31:54.078 --> 31:55.955
DYLAN (sighs):
It's, uh...

31:56.039 --> 31:58.374
too weird to explain.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.960
It doesn't matter.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.837
Listen, I...
I wanted to come over

32:02.920 --> 32:04.505
and talk to you about something.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.341
Do you remember
when I told you that

32:06.424 --> 32:08.217
I thought the baptism thing
was just a big charade

32:08.301 --> 32:11.179
and that they were just
gonna make a bunch of promises

32:11.262 --> 32:12.680
-that they wouldn't keep?
-Mm-hmm.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.349
Yeah, well, I was wrong.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.060
I mean... people definitely
make promises they don't keep,

32:17.143 --> 32:18.561
but I don't think you should.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.896
You finished?

32:19.979 --> 32:22.482
'Cause I, you know,
I got to get in there.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.151
I know Noah is gonna get
after the macadamia nuts,

32:25.234 --> 32:26.569
and they're the kind,
you know,

32:26.653 --> 32:28.196
from Hawaii,
they're expensive and...

32:28.279 --> 32:29.364
Can you listen to me
for one second?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.323
This is really important.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.325
I mean, when I first
heard about this thing,

32:32.408 --> 32:34.160
remember, I was all upset,

32:34.243 --> 32:36.579
'cause I didn't want
you and Kelly near each other,

32:36.663 --> 32:39.374
and I was all worried about,
you know,

32:39.457 --> 32:40.875
how my godfather let me down?

32:40.958 --> 32:42.335
Don't you get it?

32:42.418 --> 32:45.380
I was looking at it
from the adult's point of view.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.216
This isn't about us;
it's about Madeline.

32:50.134 --> 32:53.554
Anyway, I just,
I wanted to give you this.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.102
My godfather gave it to me

32:59.185 --> 33:00.812
for my baptism, and I thought

33:00.895 --> 33:02.772
maybe you could
give it to Madeline.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.399
If you want.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.235
You could change
her life, you know?

33:09.278 --> 33:11.572
Maybe she could change yours.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.824
(laughs)

33:32.009 --> 33:33.886
MATT:
<i>And what I did was wrong,</i>

33:33.970 --> 33:35.346
and I know that.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.766
There it is.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.102
Paid in full.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.937
How do I know
this check is good?

33:43.020 --> 33:45.732
How about because I hocked
my girlfriend's engagement ring

33:45.815 --> 33:47.734
-to get the money?
-Thank you, Miss Haymas,

33:47.817 --> 33:49.694
and the members
of the Bar Association

33:49.777 --> 33:51.195
for getting my money back.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.994
Mr. Durning,
we're not finished here.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.662
Mr. Behr got his money.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.498
You violated your oath
as an officer of the court.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.542
I know that,
and it won't happen again.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.835
I'm recommending
that you be suspended

34:05.918 --> 34:07.420
from practicing law for 30 days.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.338
Are you kidding me?
I'm not the first attorney

34:09.422 --> 34:10.797
to put a client's retainer
to use.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.925
Which is why we're making
an example out of you.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.761
Wait a minute,
I'm not with a big firm.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.387
If you suspend me,
you're gonna kill my practice.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.183
I advise you to tell
all of your current clients

34:20.266 --> 34:23.060
that you will be out of business
for the next 30 days.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.790
Hey.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.335
I don't think you've met Jenna;
she's my replacement.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.463
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:50.545 --> 34:51.464
You're leaving?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.591
-Got to put time into
my other stores. -Oh.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.176
I didn't know business
was going that well.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.720
I know this may come
as a shock to you,

34:57.804 --> 34:59.639
but some people
actually like my coffee.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.682
-I like your coffee.
-But some people

35:01.766 --> 35:03.351
are enthusiastic about it.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.478
You may like it,
but you're not enthusiastic.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.355
I can be enthusiastic
about it.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.815
I'm an enthusiastic person.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.691
Enthusiasm's my strong suit.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.406
Donna, I like you.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.033
I like you, too.

35:19.116 --> 35:21.661
-But I love what I do.
-Well, so do I.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.829
And that's why I know

35:22.912 --> 35:23.746
how important it is

35:23.830 --> 35:25.873
to be with someone
that understands that.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.250
Focus on other things.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.252
Yeah, and have a good time--
what do you say?

35:34.090 --> 35:35.508
-Mark?
-I'm sorry, but...

35:35.591 --> 35:37.844
(laughs)
what the hell is David wearing?

35:37.927 --> 35:40.763
Guy looks like a Muppet
in that sweater.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.348
Well, you're the fashion maven--

35:42.431 --> 35:43.724
save him.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.434
Well, that might be difficult,

35:45.518 --> 35:47.520
considering the sweater
that David is wearing

35:47.603 --> 35:48.855
is one that I designed.

35:51.315 --> 35:51.899
Oh.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.861
So, I'll call you sometime?

35:54.944 --> 35:56.737
Whatever.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.910
Well, looks like
you patched things up there

36:02.994 --> 36:04.579
-with the coffee guy.
-I don't want to talk about it.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.039
What do you mean, you don't
want to talk about it, Donna?

36:07.123 --> 36:08.541
It looked like
things were going great.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.293
You guys were having
a nice conversation...

36:10.376 --> 36:12.253
We're gonna be late
for the baptism.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.715
And on the way out,
burn that sweater!

36:18.843 --> 36:20.720
NOAH:
<i>All right, let's get up, guys.</i>

36:20.803 --> 36:22.471
Come on, man, get up!

36:22.555 --> 36:23.723
Lightweight! Geez!

36:23.806 --> 36:26.934
All right, what you're about
to see is not for the squeamish.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.312
My man here, Shane Oliver,

36:29.395 --> 36:30.771
is gonna snort
what's in this glass

36:30.855 --> 36:32.106
if the price is right.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.649
NOAH:
Come on, ante up.

36:33.733 --> 36:34.775
Hey, Dylan,

36:34.859 --> 36:36.861
you in or out?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.739
I'm out.

36:39.822 --> 36:40.781
The man's out.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.783
Come on, let's go.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.082
(sighs)

36:50.166 --> 36:51.918
STEVE:
Where is he?

36:52.001 --> 36:53.920
This is not good.
This is not good.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.796
Dylan's irresponsible;
we knew that.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.925
This is our own fault.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.678
The suspension's
only for 30 days.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.472
We will get through this.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.681
I know, I know.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.808
But a ring this small
is embarrassing.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.061
KELLY: This is not
embarrassing. Stop it.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.646
This, you know,
this is supposed to be

37:11.729 --> 37:13.689
a public declaration
of our commitment.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.815
When people look at this,

37:14.899 --> 37:17.818
they should see nothing
but our love for each other.

37:17.902 --> 37:18.819
And they do.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.196
(chuckles):
Oh, sure.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.698
They also see my screwup.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.700
What they should see
is two people

37:24.784 --> 37:26.202
willing to help each other,

37:26.285 --> 37:28.663
and if they see
anything other than that,

37:28.746 --> 37:31.165
then that's their fault.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.125
-You think so?
-Mm-hmm.

37:33.209 --> 37:36.253
(footsteps approaching)

37:37.254 --> 37:38.756
(whispers):
Hey.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.675
Pastor Neal,

37:40.758 --> 37:43.052
Dylan's a no-show.
What do we do?

37:43.135 --> 37:45.346
We have back-to-back services
all day,

37:45.429 --> 37:47.640
so we should go ahead
with the baptism.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.768
Dylan's role as godfather
can be sorted out later.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.645
You know what?
There's nothing to sort out.

37:52.728 --> 37:53.854
Come on, let's start.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.857
Anybody need a godfather?

38:04.907 --> 38:06.659
You know what,
swooping in last minute

38:06.742 --> 38:09.203
really worked in high school,
but it doesn't work here.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.247
You wanted me to think
about it, Steve?

38:11.330 --> 38:13.624
I thought about it--
and I'm still here.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.711
I'm here for you if you want me.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.716
(whispers):
Hold her tight; she likes that.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.803
(Madeline crying quietly)

38:35.813 --> 38:38.858
Before we get going,
can I say a few words?

38:38.941 --> 38:40.609
Oh, go ahead.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.906
It's pretty clear that
I wasn't anyone's first choice

38:45.990 --> 38:47.908
to be this child's godfather.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.870
Uh... my record with some
of the women in the room

38:50.953 --> 38:54.081
is a little less than stellar.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.711
However,
with Madeline Sosna-Sanders,

38:58.794 --> 39:00.755
my slate is a clean one.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.715
And I promise

39:02.798 --> 39:06.427
that I will always be there
for this little lady.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.430
This was given to me

39:09.513 --> 39:13.434
by a little girl
who never had a godfather...

39:15.019 --> 39:16.687
...and probably
could've used one.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.816
I'd like Madeline to have it.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.824
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.286
All right, let's do it.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.122
(organ plays gentle melody)

39:35.206 --> 39:38.292
Who presents this child
for the sacrament of baptism?

39:38.375 --> 39:40.419
Her father and I present

39:40.503 --> 39:42.755
Madeline Sosna-Sanders
for baptism.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.966
(quiet organ music playing)

39:47.218 --> 39:49.011
-(Madeline fussing)
-STEVE: It's okay,

39:49.095 --> 39:51.055
it's okay.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.685
(quietly):
Okay.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.786
I baptize you
in the name of the Father...

40:15.413 --> 40:16.872
...and of the Son...

40:18.624 --> 40:20.668
...and of the Holy Spirit.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.837
(Madeline fussing)

40:23.921 --> 40:25.798
Amen.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.842
-Amen.
-Amen.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.765
Hey...

40:37.226 --> 40:39.728
Let us welcome
the newly baptized.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.605
(Steve laughs)

41:08.966 --> 41:10.718
NOAH:
Hey.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.389
Hi.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.895
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd be at the baptism.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.230
No. I...

41:23.314 --> 41:25.024
I mean, I-I was.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.443
How was it?

41:27.526 --> 41:29.570
It was beautiful.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.739
That's good.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.574
Yeah.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.036
I heard you're staying
with David.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.288
Yeah, you know,
it's just temporary.

41:39.371 --> 41:42.082
Yeah, I... I think that's good.

41:42.166 --> 41:46.253
Staying with David or... getting
your own place, whichever.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.172
He says you're happy.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.758
Yeah.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.676
David says
the same thing about you.

41:56.722 --> 41:59.308
I left my key
on the kitchen counter, okay?

41:59.391 --> 42:01.852
Thanks.

42:06.523 --> 42:09.151
See ya.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.195
(whispers):
Bye.
