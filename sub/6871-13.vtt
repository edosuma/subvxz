WEBVTT

00:04.943 --> 00:06.544
Nereus to Mission Control, over!

00:06.639 --> 00:08.368
Because look around!

00:08.488 --> 00:10.421
Does this look
like the brain to you?

00:10.490 --> 00:11.622
No!

00:11.691 --> 00:13.357
Oh.
I was gonna say "yes."

00:13.426 --> 00:15.159
We are clearly not in the brain!

00:15.228 --> 00:16.460
Look around,
we are surrounded by--

00:16.529 --> 00:17.662
Whoa!

00:17.730 --> 00:19.330
- What the shit?
- What the hell?

00:19.399 --> 00:20.364
- Ooh!
- Sorry!

00:20.433 --> 00:22.299
Surrounded by muscle fiber...

00:22.368 --> 00:23.648
Just think if I ever worked out.

00:25.004 --> 00:26.671
Ya done?
Hm? Oh!

00:26.739 --> 00:27.979
Well, I was saying that look at

00:28.041 --> 00:29.940
all that muscle fiber,
out there,

00:30.009 --> 00:31.909
so we're obviously
not in the brain, so--

00:31.978 --> 00:33.944
so where are we,
and follow up--

00:34.013 --> 00:35.464
Nereus
to mission control--

00:35.584 --> 00:37.011
- What is with the rubbing
alcohol?

00:37.131 --> 00:39.531
- Uh, I'm making room for Tang.
- Nereus to--

00:39.651 --> 00:41.215
What?
What Tang?

00:41.335 --> 00:42.855
The Tang on which I've got
dibs, so--

00:42.922 --> 00:44.488
Why would there be Tang?

00:44.557 --> 00:46.891
Goofy Grape then, whatever!

00:46.959 --> 00:49.260
Lefty Lemon?
Lana, this is serious.

00:49.328 --> 00:50.889
If our electrolytes
get out of balance--

00:50.930 --> 00:53.364
Archer, we've only
got 57 minutes

00:53.433 --> 00:56.834
until the sub reverts back to normal size--
Killing Dr. Kovacs--

00:56.903 --> 00:59.870
and permanently ending your checkered
careers as intelligence agents.

00:59.939 --> 01:01.238
We get it.

01:01.307 --> 01:02.707
So your electrolytes can wait.

01:02.775 --> 01:05.176
Well, you say that...
So tell us what to do,

01:05.244 --> 01:07.578
how can we help you
find out where we are?

01:07.647 --> 01:09.947
Well for starters, he can quit futzing
around with the radio and get--

01:10.016 --> 01:11.515
<i>This is Mission Control, over.</i>

01:11.584 --> 01:12.616
You were saying?

01:12.685 --> 01:14.218
Goosebumps...

01:14.287 --> 01:15.920
Really wish you'd quit
dicking around.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.188
I know.

01:17.256 --> 01:19.523
Mission Control,
what is our twenty?

01:19.592 --> 01:20.958
<i>The injection was botched...</i>

01:21.027 --> 01:23.461
<i>Krieger... asshole...</i>

01:23.529 --> 01:24.395
Ew!
Shh!

01:24.464 --> 01:25.596
No! Ew!

01:25.665 --> 01:27.765
Say again, Control,
what is our twenty?

01:27.834 --> 01:30.601
<i>It appears you're</i>
<i>in Kovacs' left foot.</i>

01:30.670 --> 01:33.304
His left foot?
Oh, well that's good, right?

01:33.372 --> 01:35.573
How is that possibly good?

01:35.641 --> 01:37.808
Well, relative
to Krieger's asshole.

01:37.877 --> 01:39.944
And to this.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.346
Seriously, where do you keep
the fruity drink powder?

01:42.415 --> 01:44.515
I'd even take
Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry.

01:44.584 --> 01:47.885
How noble.
Well, no, I'd still bitch about it.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.754
And I think I've earned
that right.

02:29.343 --> 02:31.820
What's wrong,
why aren't they moving?

02:31.940 --> 02:33.812
Who knows?
Their radio's damaged.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.861
Maybe the propulsion system
is, too.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.382
Nereus,
this is Mission Control--

02:37.451 --> 02:39.484
Oh, for the--
they know who it is!

02:39.553 --> 02:41.386
If I were to make
a list of things

02:41.455 --> 02:43.555
I'm not in the mood for right now--

02:45.158 --> 02:47.726
That would be second
on said list.

02:47.794 --> 02:49.094
What is it,
does she need to be fed?

02:49.162 --> 02:51.162
Wants, maybe.
I wouldn't say "need."

02:51.231 --> 02:53.331
She's about to pop out
of that onesie.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.133
She seems like
a normal baby weight.

02:55.202 --> 02:58.570
Oh, yes, and everyone deserves
a trophy just for showing up,

02:58.639 --> 03:01.473
and everyone's
Kickstarter has merit.

03:01.541 --> 03:02.474
Pff.

03:03.777 --> 03:05.210
Okay people, listen up!

03:05.279 --> 03:06.611
We're bailing!

03:06.680 --> 03:08.913
What're you-- Archer,
if you bail on this mission,

03:08.982 --> 03:10.181
your career is over!

03:10.250 --> 03:12.250
Oh, eat several dicks, Slater!

03:12.319 --> 03:15.053
Your people shot us
in this guy's foot, not us!

03:15.122 --> 03:17.289
Well?
Are we bailing or not?

03:17.357 --> 03:18.256
- Yes!
- No!

03:18.325 --> 03:19.691
Oh, my God...
Seriously,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.626
shit or get off the pot.

03:21.695 --> 03:23.728
Ya know, on the farm
it was actually a pot,

03:23.797 --> 03:26.398
like...it was literally a pot.

03:28.201 --> 03:30.535
I have absolutely
no response to that.

03:30.604 --> 03:33.571
Because forgetting, for the
moment, that Dr. Kovacs will die

03:33.640 --> 03:35.841
if we don't laser that blood clot, how--
With the laser,

03:35.842 --> 03:37.342
we cut a hole in his foot,

03:37.411 --> 03:41.346
zrrp, and slide on out, flrrp.

03:41.415 --> 03:44.282
It's basically
the old zrrp-and-flrrp.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.284
Archer, we're the size
of a bacteria--

03:46.353 --> 03:47.552
Bacterium.

03:47.621 --> 03:49.454
Thanks, Jill Nye--
Zrrp.

03:49.523 --> 03:51.156
So no one
could see us--

03:51.224 --> 03:52.524
until 48 minutes from now,

03:52.592 --> 03:54.159
when the sub reverts
back to normal--

03:54.227 --> 03:55.593
Killing not only
Dr. Kovacs,

03:55.662 --> 03:57.629
but everybody else in the room.

03:57.698 --> 03:59.731
And we can reach the clot in time!
How?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.466
To get from his foot
all the way to his brain

04:01.535 --> 04:03.335
would take, like--
literally one minute.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.303
I'm sorry, I think you mean figur--
Literally.

04:05.372 --> 04:07.672
That's how long it takes blood
to cycle through the body, so--

04:07.741 --> 04:09.107
- Seriously?
- What?

04:09.176 --> 04:10.108
Yeah, that doesn't sound right.

04:10.177 --> 04:11.710
Well, we could ask Wikipedia...

04:11.778 --> 04:14.312
Good luck,
I've got negative one bars.

04:14.381 --> 04:18.083
Or we could just ask me, the woman who
graduated from Harvard Medical School

04:18.151 --> 04:20.719
summa cum laude.
With a minor in Spanish bragging...

04:20.786 --> 04:22.587
A-- that was Latin.
He knows.

04:22.656 --> 04:25.857
And B-- we just have to laser our way
into one of these veins here.

04:25.977 --> 04:28.314
Flurp! Wait, no; zurp!

04:28.434 --> 04:30.978
Then the blood flow will take
us into the inferior vena cava,

04:31.098 --> 04:32.330
then up through the right atrium,

04:32.399 --> 04:34.232
tricuspid valve,
right ventricle,

04:34.301 --> 04:36.067
pulmonic valve,
pulmonary artery,

04:36.136 --> 04:37.969
into the lungs, pulmonary veins,

04:38.038 --> 04:39.170
left atrium, mitral valve,

04:39.239 --> 04:40.672
left ventricle, aortic valve,

04:40.741 --> 04:42.540
aorta, common carotid artery...

04:42.609 --> 04:44.242
Internal carotid artery, and then...

04:44.311 --> 04:46.277
I can probably
find it from there.

04:46.346 --> 04:49.080
So if the blood flow will
take us right to the clot,

04:49.149 --> 04:50.982
what's the catch?
The catch

04:51.051 --> 04:53.918
is that we'll be going between
three and four miles an hour.

04:53.987 --> 04:55.687
Big whoop?

04:55.756 --> 04:57.288
No? Nobody?

04:57.357 --> 04:58.556
Oh, shit...

04:58.625 --> 05:00.358
If we're the size
of a tiny germ...

05:00.427 --> 05:01.826
Yes,
to us it will seem like--

05:01.895 --> 05:03.962
Making the jump to hyperspace?

05:04.030 --> 05:05.263
If by "hyperspace"

05:05.332 --> 05:06.664
you're referring
to the film "Star Wars"

05:06.733 --> 05:08.433
and not bosonic string theory,
then--

05:08.502 --> 05:10.435
Shh.
There's enough room in the world

05:10.504 --> 05:13.471
for science and miracles.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.460
Okay people, listen up!
When we go into that vein

05:15.509 --> 05:17.642
we're gonna get hit
with about ten G's.

05:17.711 --> 05:19.210
- Buckle up!
- No!

05:19.279 --> 05:20.612
Just kidding.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.213
- That's a lot of G's.
- Oh,

05:22.282 --> 05:24.433
so suddenly you don't have
a death wish?

05:24.553 --> 05:26.319
Lana, I've never had
a death wish.

05:26.388 --> 05:28.822
It's just that I don't believe
that I personally...

05:28.891 --> 05:30.657
even can die.

05:30.726 --> 05:33.960
Wow...
Although I do believe in ghosts.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.929
Not sure
if that's related, or...

05:37.499 --> 05:39.066
Guess I better put these away

05:39.134 --> 05:40.814
since they're tungsten,
and insanely sharp.

05:40.836 --> 05:43.937
Yeah...
Should you even have those?

05:44.006 --> 05:46.506
I shouldn't even have yarn.

05:46.575 --> 05:50.744
And I should not
have volunteered for this.

05:50.813 --> 05:52.612
So, I saw you
coming on to Archer--

05:52.681 --> 05:54.481
Look, I'm a sexual being.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.550
If that is shocking
to you, then so be it.

05:56.618 --> 05:58.185
It's not,
I was just gonna tell you

05:58.253 --> 05:59.453
he's had the clap so many times

05:59.455 --> 06:00.787
it's more like applause.

06:00.856 --> 06:01.655
<i>Uh, what was that?</i>

06:01.724 --> 06:03.690
I said, ready on that laser?

06:03.759 --> 06:05.292
<i>Duh.</i>

06:05.360 --> 06:06.259
Then fire at--

06:08.597 --> 06:10.797
...will.
Great.

06:10.866 --> 06:12.666
Okay, Gillette,
now just slip it in

06:12.735 --> 06:15.168
nice and easy...

06:15.237 --> 06:18.572
<i>I mean... what about "That's what she said"?</i>
<i>Can we at least do that?</i>

06:18.640 --> 06:20.507
<i>Hush! Here we go, people!</i>

06:20.576 --> 06:22.275
God, I will be glad
when this is over.

06:22.344 --> 06:24.010
Yeah, and when it is,

06:24.079 --> 06:27.681
I think you really should apologize to Lana.
For what?

06:27.750 --> 06:30.951
For being so racist about your hand!
Wh--? Racist?

06:31.019 --> 06:33.553
Yeah, all that
<i>Driving Miss Daisy</i> stuff,

06:33.622 --> 06:34.721
and the piggly wiggly,

06:34.790 --> 06:36.289
and the--
Oh, my God!

06:36.358 --> 06:37.991
I was mad because
it's a robot hand,

06:38.060 --> 06:39.493
not because it's black!

06:39.561 --> 06:40.694
<i>Hang on!</i>

06:40.763 --> 06:42.711
Oh. Because it totally
seemed like--

06:42.831 --> 06:44.844
<i>- I gotta go tell her!</i>
<i>- No, no, no!</i>

06:50.405 --> 06:51.538
Waa!

06:54.042 --> 06:56.309
Ugh, are you crippled again?

06:58.914 --> 06:59.813
Yep.

06:59.882 --> 07:01.414
Well, cheer up, buddy.

07:01.483 --> 07:04.217
Maybe Krieger can get you
some black bionic legs.

07:04.286 --> 07:06.920
Just like Jesse Owens!

07:06.989 --> 07:10.490
Who may or may not
have been a robot.

07:10.559 --> 07:14.661
Although I might be thinking
of the Jetsons' maid.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.597
Wait, was she black?

07:23.172 --> 07:24.733
What do you mean, he's crippled?

07:24.740 --> 07:26.740
Differently-abled,
whatever!

07:26.809 --> 07:29.009
No, we can just
go with crippled...

07:29.077 --> 07:30.237
Then who's steering the ship?

07:30.245 --> 07:31.511
I am!

07:32.781 --> 07:34.247
Now's the perfect time...

07:34.316 --> 07:35.916
Not like you haven't
dreamed about it...

07:35.984 --> 07:38.018
Just crash the sub
and kill them, Cyril.

07:38.086 --> 07:38.952
<i>Okay, Cyril?</i>

07:39.021 --> 07:40.460
Hm? Yes? Over?

07:40.580 --> 07:41.661
We're through the heart now,

07:41.690 --> 07:43.291
and we need to get
to the carotid artery,

07:43.325 --> 07:45.559
so on my mark,
turn hard to starboard.

07:45.627 --> 07:47.364
And refresh my memory,
starboard is--

07:47.484 --> 07:48.317
<i>Mark!</i>

07:51.195 --> 07:53.255
<i>Now on my mark, hard to port!</i>
And that's--?

07:53.324 --> 07:54.284
<i>Mark!</i>
Ah!

07:56.527 --> 07:58.560
Okay, this is it...

07:58.629 --> 08:01.108
Wow, guess it
does just take a minute.

08:01.545 --> 08:03.279
<i>So they're in the brain now?</i>

08:03.399 --> 08:05.437
<i>Well, we're assuming they are.</i>

08:05.668 --> 08:08.103
We have to wait for them
to tell us their location.

08:08.172 --> 08:11.173
The sub is too small to track
with our current technology.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.042
Maybe the CIA should do a Kickstarter.

08:14.111 --> 08:18.080
Can someone please
get that child some food!

08:18.148 --> 08:20.682
Oh, all right, she can have...

08:20.751 --> 08:23.752
One cocktail onion.

08:23.821 --> 08:27.389
Okay, there's the blood clot.
Fascinating.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.225
Ugh!
People's bodies are so gross.

08:30.294 --> 08:31.574
Well, some people can't help it!

08:31.628 --> 08:33.562
<i>Wh--? Not you, Pam.</i>

08:33.630 --> 08:37.232
I was talking about Ray.
Seriously, you're like filet o' man.

08:37.301 --> 08:39.467
- Ya know...
<i>- Time to deminiaturization--</i>

08:39.535 --> 08:40.568
<i>40 minutes.</i>

08:40.636 --> 08:42.136
So hey, if you've got this...

08:42.206 --> 08:44.106
I've always got everything.

08:44.174 --> 08:46.141
Then I'm gonna go check on Ray.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.310
Oh, tell him--
no, never mind.

08:48.379 --> 08:50.078
No?
You don't have a pun-based

08:50.147 --> 08:51.947
little zinger
about walking, or--

08:52.016 --> 08:53.448
No, I'm actually...

08:53.517 --> 08:55.684
kinda worried
he's gonna kill himself.

08:55.753 --> 08:57.452
<i>Laser turret,
prepare for thrombolysis.</i>

08:57.521 --> 08:59.654
Uh... is there a knob
for that, or--

08:59.723 --> 09:02.157
<i>It means
destruction of the thrombus.</i>

09:02.226 --> 09:04.226
Uh...
<i>The thrombus is the blood clot!</i>

09:04.294 --> 09:05.994
Oh, duh...

09:06.063 --> 09:08.807
Yes, obviously you've got this.

09:08.927 --> 09:12.567
All right, Archer, you have to be sure
not to let the laser detach the thrombus

09:12.636 --> 09:15.537
from the artery wall. The last
thing we want is an embolism.

09:15.606 --> 09:17.739
<i>No shit,</i>
<i>that's my third biggest fear.</i>

09:17.808 --> 09:19.474
<i>That's an aneurysm.</i>

09:19.543 --> 09:20.743
<i>Okay, fourth biggest, whatever.</i>

09:20.751 --> 09:24.312
Archer, focus. We've got less than
40 minutes to deminiaturization!

09:24.381 --> 09:27.041
Oh, shit. And even less than
that until we're out of oxygen.

09:27.161 --> 09:30.419
Wait, what?
O2 consumption's about 12 percent higher

09:30.487 --> 09:32.154
than it should be...
12 percent?

09:32.222 --> 09:33.622
That's like an entire...

09:33.690 --> 09:35.791
Extra person.

09:35.859 --> 09:37.993
- A person called...
- What the--?

09:38.062 --> 09:39.161
God damn it, Michael!

09:39.229 --> 09:41.563
TV's Michael Gray.

09:41.632 --> 09:43.206
You ruined it.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.617
And also please let me out.
No!

09:46.737 --> 09:48.537
- Uh, what's going on?
<i>- Well,</i>

09:48.605 --> 09:50.572
<i>TV's Michael Gray is on
board, for some reason.</i>

09:50.641 --> 09:52.641
<i>What?</i>
Mikey Mike!

09:52.709 --> 09:56.478
And where are you two going?
Up there, to gawk at TV's Michael Gray.

09:56.547 --> 09:59.681
And, we're taking these razor sharp
tungsten knitting needles with us.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.150
What about Ray?
He can't come, he's crippled.

10:02.219 --> 10:05.353
Lana!

10:05.422 --> 10:07.656
And also physically.
What the--?

10:07.724 --> 10:10.759
Wh--? Cyril! Can you see where we're going
with your head up your ass?

10:10.828 --> 10:13.695
That wasn't me,
we're not even moving!

10:13.764 --> 10:16.024
<i>It's leukocytes!
White blood cells!</i>

10:16.144 --> 10:18.031
<i>Agh, they must think we're</i>
<i>bacterium!</i>

10:18.376 --> 10:21.627
<i>Well, let's see how they like</i>
<i>having a laser beam blasted up...</i>

10:21.747 --> 10:24.518
<i>whichever part of the leukocyte
is the asshole.</i>

10:25.522 --> 10:27.966
Um, Alex, I think
my buzzer's broken.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.010
Goddammit!

10:29.079 --> 10:30.359
The laser capacitors
are damaged!

10:30.414 --> 10:31.513
Is that bad?

10:31.582 --> 10:33.081
What do you think?

10:33.150 --> 10:36.084
That you'd better
watch your tone?

10:36.153 --> 10:40.422
I'm... so...
sah-hah-hah-hah-reee...

10:40.491 --> 10:42.591
And I accept
your apology, but, honey,

10:42.659 --> 10:45.460
I need to go see what's going on...
It's God's wrath!

10:45.529 --> 10:48.930
For lettin' my self-loathing
about my ever-increasing bionics

10:48.999 --> 10:50.699
make you think I'm a racist!

10:50.767 --> 10:52.734
Well, I don't know about
God's wrath, but--

10:52.803 --> 10:54.970
Oh but you will,
Miss Unwed Mother.

10:55.038 --> 10:56.740
Okay.
Ow!

10:56.860 --> 10:59.774
Hey, one of those leukocyte things
just blobbed all over the windshield--

10:59.843 --> 11:01.376
Cyril, shut up.
What're we doing?

11:02.446 --> 11:03.411
Suffocating!

11:03.480 --> 11:04.546
Oh, sorry, Mikey Mike...

11:04.615 --> 11:05.647
No no no,
don't let him--

11:05.716 --> 11:06.648
Ta-da!

11:08.318 --> 11:10.318
I think sometimes
you oversell it, buddy.

11:10.387 --> 11:12.621
Great, now we can all suffocate.

11:12.689 --> 11:16.191
- Excuse me? - We only had enough oxygen
for eight crew, not nine,

11:16.260 --> 11:19.461
so thanks to TV's Michael Gray,
we're low on oxygen.

11:19.530 --> 11:21.029
Why is he here?
What? Are you kidding me?

11:21.098 --> 11:22.430
Dammit, Michael Gray,
it's bad enough

11:22.499 --> 11:24.065
we're getting devoured
by leukocytes!

11:24.134 --> 11:25.534
Well, what do you want me to do,

11:25.602 --> 11:27.669
transform into Captain Marvel
and save the day?

11:27.738 --> 11:29.437
I'd be happy
if you could transform

11:29.506 --> 11:31.006
into Jackson Bostwick!

11:36.380 --> 11:38.180
S-sorry.

11:38.248 --> 11:40.048
I guess I had that coming, huh?

11:40.117 --> 11:41.716
Will you explain
that to me later?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.485
I was gonna ask you to.

11:43.554 --> 11:45.353
<i>Time until miniaturization--</i>

11:45.422 --> 11:47.155
Okay, so we've got--
<i>30 minutes.</i>

11:47.224 --> 11:49.558
Thanks, and since the laser's
all jibbered up...

11:49.626 --> 11:52.427
Someone will just have to
go out there in scuba gear

11:52.496 --> 11:54.362
and use this portable laser

11:54.431 --> 11:58.033
to destroy the clot and fend
off attacking leukocytes.

11:58.101 --> 12:00.702
And I guess that someone is me.

12:00.771 --> 12:03.004
Us.
I'm going with you.

12:03.073 --> 12:05.006
Oh my God, Michael, it's over.

12:05.075 --> 12:06.408
Stop trying to impress me!

12:06.476 --> 12:08.710
And also no offense,
but you're tiny.

12:08.779 --> 12:11.079
But, Archer, somebody
has to watch your back.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.315
Well that somebody's not
gonna be A.J.'s mother,

12:13.383 --> 12:15.383
so... Slater.

12:15.452 --> 12:17.586
No way,
you're just gonna frag me!

12:17.654 --> 12:18.720
I totally was.

12:18.789 --> 12:20.155
Okay, so... Pam.

12:20.224 --> 12:22.224
Yay!

12:22.292 --> 12:24.960
Well don't rub it in
TV's Michael Gray's face!

12:25.028 --> 12:26.428
Sorry.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.231
Oh, fuck you.

12:30.989 --> 12:32.756
<i>Time to deminiaturization--</i>

12:32.824 --> 12:34.824
<i>15 minutes.</i>

12:34.893 --> 12:38.161
Because who takes 15 minutes
to put on a damn wetsuit?

12:38.230 --> 12:41.631
Who has an entire submarine with
no damn talcum powder on board?

12:41.700 --> 12:44.634
<i>And Archer, remember,
do not let the leukocytes touch you.</i>

12:44.703 --> 12:45.769
<i>They're--</i>
Macrophages.

12:45.837 --> 12:48.071
Yeah, got it.
What's that mean?

12:48.140 --> 12:51.508
It means they'll slowly turn
your entire body inside out

12:51.577 --> 12:54.511
and devour every single cell
you're made of.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.846
Holy snacrophages.

12:56.915 --> 12:59.516
Oh. I thought it was a type of wizard.

12:59.585 --> 13:01.885
Hey, you guys wanna take
my needles?

13:01.954 --> 13:04.028
What?
No, why would we want those?

13:04.148 --> 13:05.781
They're tungsten.
Move.

13:05.849 --> 13:07.149
Archer, listen to me,

13:07.217 --> 13:09.050
I know you think
you're invincible.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.852
Plus now I have
a laser backpack.

13:10.921 --> 13:12.254
But you're
a father now--

13:12.322 --> 13:14.322
With a laser backpack.

13:14.391 --> 13:17.793
Shut up.
And please... be careful.

13:17.861 --> 13:20.495
No. To both.

13:20.564 --> 13:22.197
Woo-hoo!

13:22.266 --> 13:25.133
Leukocytes!

13:25.202 --> 13:26.868
Thirteen minutes to go...

13:26.937 --> 13:28.303
And just to reiterate,

13:28.372 --> 13:29.838
if your people fail--

13:29.907 --> 13:31.873
We'll never work
in espionage again.

13:31.942 --> 13:34.609
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

13:34.678 --> 13:37.979
Maybe we can live on all the prize
money she wins as a competitive eater.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.149
So, how are they doing
out there?

13:41.218 --> 13:43.752
About like you'd expect,
from Archer.

13:43.821 --> 13:45.387
Woo!

13:47.024 --> 13:49.157
Eat that, you stupid macrophage!

13:49.226 --> 13:51.426
There's another one,
nine o'clock!

13:51.495 --> 13:54.462
Oh, my God, I
could do this all day.

13:54.531 --> 13:56.400
<i>Well since we
don't have all day...</i>

13:56.520 --> 13:57.623
Shut up!

13:57.743 --> 13:59.257
Coming up on 12 minutes.

13:59.377 --> 14:01.752
Will we have enough time to reach the
extraction point on his tear duct?

14:01.872 --> 14:03.905
We should. From here
via the optic nerve

14:03.974 --> 14:05.207
should only take 90 seconds,

14:05.275 --> 14:07.275
then another 60
to the tear duct.

14:07.344 --> 14:10.445
So we even have time...
to make love.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.047
What?
Sex.

14:12.115 --> 14:13.515
Inside my lover's own body.

14:13.584 --> 14:15.450
It would be
the ultimate cuckold.

14:15.519 --> 14:18.887
Ew, no!
Lady, you've got problems.

14:18.956 --> 14:21.756
Plus TV's Michael Gray
is staring right at us.

14:27.097 --> 14:28.997
Okay, that was
the last one for now.

14:29.066 --> 14:31.266
Keep a lookout
while I zrrp the clot.

14:31.335 --> 14:33.215
<i>And remember,
you have to make sure</i>

14:33.270 --> 14:35.103
<i>it doesn't break free</i>
<i>from the--</i>

14:36.940 --> 14:39.174
What was that?
Sorry, I couldn't hear you

14:39.243 --> 14:43.078
over the sound of me thrombolyzing
the shit out of that thrombus.

14:43.146 --> 14:45.213
Well? Are you just gonna
stand there and gloat?

14:45.282 --> 14:47.148
<i>Technically, Lana, I'm floating.</i>

14:47.217 --> 14:49.317
<i>It's basically</i>
<i>the old float-and-gloat--</i>

14:49.386 --> 14:51.253
<i>Get back to
the ship, you asshole!</i>

14:51.321 --> 14:53.889
Okay, but only
because I choose to.

14:53.957 --> 14:56.725
Archer, look out! Wh--?

14:56.793 --> 15:01.296
And also because it seems like
the prudent course of action.

15:01.365 --> 15:04.165
<i>Time to
deminiaturization-- 10 minutes.</i>

15:04.234 --> 15:07.269
Dammit. Okay,
get ready for the extraction.

15:07.337 --> 15:10.538
Get ready how? We don't even know
if the sub is in his tear duct yet!

15:10.607 --> 15:13.475
So go get an eyedropper,
and for the next 10 minutes

15:13.543 --> 15:16.778
just keep eyedroppering out his tears
and moving them into the hangar!

15:16.847 --> 15:19.314
Scoop out his whole damn
eyeball if you have to!

15:19.383 --> 15:22.784
Oh no-no-no-no,
we wouldn't do dat,

15:22.853 --> 15:25.320
would we? No,
dat's a meanie-bo-beanie...

15:26.890 --> 15:29.491
Okay, door's closed!
Hit it!

15:29.559 --> 15:30.920
Alright, we're in,
purging airloc--

15:30.961 --> 15:32.761
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

15:32.829 --> 15:34.796
I'm sorry, what was that?

15:34.865 --> 15:37.399
The ship cannot move

15:37.467 --> 15:40.335
- while the airlock is purging.
<i>- Oh.</i>

15:40.404 --> 15:44.472
Uh, kinda seems like a design flaw...
We could start drinking it.

15:44.541 --> 15:46.074
That would
save like, two seconds!

15:46.143 --> 15:47.909
Well, plus I'm pretty thirsty.

15:47.978 --> 15:50.912
Pam, it's blood.
I'm pretty thirsty.

15:50.981 --> 15:53.714
<i>Time to
deminiaturization-- eight minutes.</i>

15:53.834 --> 15:54.900
Okay, Cyril!

15:54.969 --> 15:56.502
You have to be ready to go

15:56.571 --> 15:58.011
the second
that the airlock is clear!

15:58.072 --> 16:00.539
Clear?
Yes! Yes?

16:00.608 --> 16:03.309
Yeah, what could
possibly go wrong...

16:04.385 --> 16:05.865
Okay, this eyedropper's full!

16:05.910 --> 16:07.576
Here! Go! Move!

Ah!

16:30.668 --> 16:32.301

Okay Cyril,
here comes the optic nerve!

16:34.371 --> 16:35.571

we go find a sizzler

flowerpot bread?

18:02.159 --> 18:04.159

18:08.866 --> 18:10.832
So take this unlucky baby...

18:10.901 --> 18:14.303
while I focus on the two positive
aspects of this debacle,

18:14.371 --> 18:16.838
the first being that you people
will no longer be a stain

18:16.907 --> 18:19.274
on the escutcheon of the
clandestine services, and--

18:19.343 --> 18:21.243
No, please!
You can't blacklist us.

18:21.312 --> 18:23.245
This is all I've ever known, it's--
Shh!

18:23.314 --> 18:26.848
The second positive is that even though Dr.
Kovacs is dead,

18:26.917 --> 18:29.186
his miniaturization
process lives on

18:29.306 --> 18:32.070
in the memory banks of the supercomputer...

18:44.501 --> 18:47.269
Woo!
Shrinky-dink that!

18:47.338 --> 18:48.370
Krieger out!

18:51.108 --> 18:52.374
Which...

18:52.443 --> 18:55.410
Dr. Kovacs
conceived and built

18:55.479 --> 18:58.480
the magnum opus of what was
surely the greatest mind

18:58.549 --> 19:00.849
of his generation.

19:03.687 --> 19:06.688
And so you work your whole life
for something, for a cause,

19:06.757 --> 19:09.124
and in the end what do
you have to show for it?

19:09.193 --> 19:11.893
No parade, no statue,
no medal of freedom,

19:11.962 --> 19:13.495
no songs of heroic deeds...

19:15.232 --> 19:18.066
Just an ulcer and you, dear...

19:18.135 --> 19:21.136
Who I honestly think
just gave me a hernia.

19:30.481 --> 19:33.882
Well, if you fed her,
like you said you did,

19:33.951 --> 19:35.776
why is she still hungry?

19:35.896 --> 19:38.520
Who knows with her?
A tapeworm?

19:38.589 --> 19:42.357
And after that disaster, you'd all
better get used to being hungry.

19:42.426 --> 19:44.159
At least until I can find a way

19:44.228 --> 19:46.061
to get us back in with the CIA.

19:46.130 --> 19:48.263
Why bother?
Excuse me?

19:48.332 --> 19:51.433
Well, look, I can't speak for Archer--
And yet--

19:51.502 --> 19:53.602
but I don't want to risk
my life on shady missions

19:53.671 --> 19:55.707
for those assholes at the CIA.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.072
I have a child to raise.

19:57.141 --> 19:58.607
So do I!
Well, not...

19:58.676 --> 20:00.676
And besides, they
obviously set us up.

20:00.744 --> 20:03.045
They've always wanted us to fail.
Why would they--

20:03.113 --> 20:07.349
Why would you wanna work for those
Ivy League white-shoe D.C. pricks?

20:08.919 --> 20:10.252
That's not who we are!

20:10.321 --> 20:13.488
We're the outsiders,
the scrappy underdogs!

20:15.125 --> 20:17.159
We're Delta House,
the Dirty Dozen,

20:17.227 --> 20:19.628
<i>The Rebel Alliance.</i>
<i>The Commitments!</i>

20:19.697 --> 20:21.463
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

20:21.532 --> 20:23.899
<i>We're the Bad News Frickin'</i>
<i>Bears,</i>

20:23.967 --> 20:26.601
and our Lupus
is an openly gay cyborg

20:26.670 --> 20:28.770
dying of sepsis
in a wheelbarrow!

20:28.839 --> 20:31.640
Woo! That's us!

20:31.709 --> 20:33.408
I do think he's
actually dying, though.

20:33.477 --> 20:36.478
So why would you want to go
back to being the CIA's--

20:36.547 --> 20:38.613
sorry, but-- bitch?

20:38.682 --> 20:40.349
Because, you peawit,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.351
what are we going
to do for money?

20:42.419 --> 20:44.486
Well...

20:44.606 --> 20:47.182
I actually have
some thoughts on that.
