00:10.211 --> 00:13.145
This man is insane.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.948
He's a predator.
He should have gone to hell.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.617
- It really freaked me out.
- I just want it gone.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.488
I see a war.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.689
What a horrible way to go.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.091
You're my last hope.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.960
He likes them young.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.896
He needs to get the hell
out of my house.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.333
They're absorbing
way too much dead energy.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.869
This is not a good situation.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.737
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.339
There's death here.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.074
Don't wanna go down there.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.342
I see dead people.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.444
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.113
I speak to dead people...

00:48.115 --> 00:50.916
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.718
...and they speak to me.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.887
She's going to torture them.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.690
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.826
They were all murdered.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.327
I rely on my partner.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.896
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.697
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.400
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.970
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.972 --> 01:16.041
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.743
It's my job to reveal them.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.378
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.547
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:21.549 --> 01:23.582
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.817
...until the very end.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.452
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.520
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:28.522 --> 01:30.022
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.690
Or time to get out.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.692
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

01:47.241 --> 01:49.341
I'm in the small town
of Briceville, Tennessee.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.910
It's about a half-hour north
of Knoxville.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.213
I got a call from
a single mom named Leonora.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.715
Now, this poor woman
scrimped and saved to buy

01:56.717 --> 01:58.550
a dream house
for her three kids.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.885
Now here's the problem --

01:59.887 --> 02:01.887
they're all being pushed,
scratched,

02:01.889 --> 02:03.789
and basically scared to death.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.357
She says if we can't help,

02:05.359 --> 02:07.493
someone is going to
wind up badly hurt.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.633
Before Amy arrives,

02:14.635 --> 02:18.403
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.340
This home has a lot
of photographs

02:21.342 --> 02:23.609
and religious symbols,

02:23.611 --> 02:27.913
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.916
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.295
Boy.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.164
I'm just hearing, like,
"Don't come down here."

02:46.166 --> 02:48.267
It's an older male.

02:48.269 --> 02:52.104
He doesn't want living
or dead out here.

02:55.509 --> 03:00.479
He's saying, "Mine. Mine.
Mine. Mine. It's all mine."

03:00.481 --> 03:02.347
How would he affect
the living?

03:02.349 --> 03:08.153
I think, with him, it would be
impressing upon them emotions

03:08.155 --> 03:11.323
of fear and urgency to get out.

03:11.325 --> 03:17.396
This man is completely,
utterly insane.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.973
So, Leonora, you sounded
terrified on the phone.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.908
What are you guys
going through?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.944
I feel like something
is evil here.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.279
It's attacking my family.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.248
It's targeting my kids.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.017
I don't know what to do
to protect them.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.086
How long have you guys
been living here?

03:41.088 --> 03:42.821
I've been here
a little over a year.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.122
Do you know anything
about the history

03:44.124 --> 03:45.557
of the house
or the property?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.392
I was told by a neighbor

03:47.394 --> 03:50.529
that the previous owners
had passed away.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.431
- In the house?
- Yes.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.166
That's something
I'll look into.

03:54.168 --> 03:55.801
Who exactly
lives in the house?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.070
I have a photo.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.973
This is my 14-year-old son,
William.

04:00.975 --> 04:05.043
This is me, my 20-year-old
daughter, Amber.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.480
This is my 4-year-old son,
Easton.

04:08.482 --> 04:13.151
I adopted him to make sure
he had a safe place to go,

04:13.153 --> 04:17.089
and I do not feel like
he has a safe place here.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.492
Easton is being targeted.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.362
He sees things that
we can't explain.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.998
It's getting
very physical with him.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.599
That's got to be hard
on you as a mom.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.434
It's a little
heartbreaking for me.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.802
Do me a favor.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.405
Give me a list of what's
going on as far as activity.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.340
We have everything.

04:35.342 --> 04:40.145
There's been footsteps,
feeling watched, items moving,

04:40.147 --> 04:41.647
shadow figures,

04:41.649 --> 04:45.350
constant nausea,
and physical attacks.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.551
I've got to ask you
a question.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.753
Why don't you just
pick up and leave?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.955
Moving is not an option.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.891
I've poured every bit
of life savings in this home.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.728
What are you hoping to get
out of this investigation?

04:56.730 --> 05:01.066
My family to be safe and go back
to the way it used to be

05:01.068 --> 05:04.069
before we were being
assaulted.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.272
The kids are afraid,
so that breaks my heart.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.875
What do you think is in
this house? What's it want?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.244
I believe it wants to tear
our family apart,

05:12.246 --> 05:15.514
and I believe that it wants us
out of the house.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.920
There's something wrong.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.723
The old dead guy,

05:24.725 --> 05:28.026
he particularly
likes to bother children.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.931
He does call them rug rats,

05:32.933 --> 05:36.802
and he says they are like rats.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.370
They're pests.

05:38.372 --> 05:42.607
And he's very grumpy.
He's very angry.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.943
He will get into...rages.

05:44.945 --> 05:49.114
When he's in a...mood,
he stomps, like...

05:51.118 --> 05:52.984
The whole house will shake.

05:52.986 --> 05:57.389
The living, with him,
would definitely hear

05:57.391 --> 06:01.493
stomping all throughout
the house.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.834
Okay, Leonora, what's going on
in this hallway?

06:08.836 --> 06:12.437
Footsteps coming up and down
the hallway almost nightly.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.839
All right.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.973
So when you hear these steps,
what's it sound like?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.776
I would say it sounds
like a heavier man

06:17.778 --> 06:19.711
stomping down the hallway.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.646
You sure it's nobody that got up
in the middle of the night?

06:21.648 --> 06:26.952
No, because I've got up and
checked, and nothing is there.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.687
Okay. What else?

06:28.689 --> 06:31.256
When I'm laying in
my bedroom at night,

06:31.258 --> 06:33.892
I see a very tall
dark figure of a man

06:33.894 --> 06:36.161
moving up
and down the hallway.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.629
What makes you say
it's a man?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.865
Just the way it's built.
It's really tall.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.501
It's a lot taller
than anybody in the house.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.035
So could it be somebody
on the outside

06:44.037 --> 06:46.037
walking back and forth?
- No.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.173
I keep the blinds shut
all the time.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.608
All right. Anything else?

06:49.610 --> 06:55.180
In the living room, a flashlight
flew off of the coffee table.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.149
Gave me chills.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.416
Couldn't it have just
rolled off?

06:58.418 --> 07:02.020
It is completely square.
There's no way it can roll off.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.589
The scary part is
if it could do that,

07:04.591 --> 07:05.857
it could have
flung it at your head.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.559
Who's to say they won't
pick it up and throw it

07:07.561 --> 07:09.427
at Easton,
being so young?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.530
You know, it could kill him.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.203
This old man,
I'm trying to get out of him

07:18.205 --> 07:20.639
all the...that he does
to the living.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.908
Do they see him?

07:22.910 --> 07:26.945
I think they do see him
when he's pitching a fit.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.347
Why do you get mad?

07:29.349 --> 07:31.383
I'm seeing him getting mad

07:31.385 --> 07:34.419
and throwing things
around violently.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.791
He's showing me plates flying.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.961
He says,
"This is my spectacular."

07:42.963 --> 07:45.564
He says, "That scares them."

07:45.566 --> 07:47.532
He likes that.

07:47.534 --> 07:50.001
It scares them.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.509
So, Leonora, obviously,
this is your bedroom. Right.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.778
And this is where your
youngest sleeps with you?
Yes.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.013
Have you ever seen him
have an experience?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.615
He's been
physically attacked.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.152
I've seen him being shoved
really hard in the back.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.454
- You sure he didn't trip?
- His neck and back,

08:09.456 --> 08:12.123
it looked like somebody
had physically shoved him.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.658
Did he tell you
who shoved him?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.262
He just said,
"The big man."

08:17.264 --> 08:19.397
Was that the only time
you've see him get attacked?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.133
No. I have a photo.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.803
He has woken up
with bruises.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.738
It sounds like
he's getting the brunt

08:26.740 --> 08:28.440
of a lot
of this physical stuff.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.642
Now what about you?
What's going on with you?

08:30.644 --> 08:34.011
I'm getting a feeling of being
very sick to my stomach

08:34.014 --> 08:37.015
all of a sudden and the life
being sucked out of me.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.150
I feel drained,
just nauseous.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.086
Now, is that only in this
room you feel this way?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.388
Mostly in here.
It just hits me.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.990
It's pretty bad.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.791
If you walk outside,
does it stop?

08:46.793 --> 08:48.426
Yes. It does go away.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.527
Have you been to the doctor?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.429
- I go for normal checkups.
- Right.

08:51.431 --> 08:55.533
They can't find anything
that would cause that.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.868
Okay. Anything else?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.938
My TV comes on by itself.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.241
The TV will just
pop on or pop off.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.743
Okay. Have you had
the electric checked?

09:04.745 --> 09:05.911
I have.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.545
You really got a lot
going on here.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.748
You did a real incredible
thing saving this kid,

09:09.750 --> 09:12.617
and then you sacrificed
everything to buy a home

09:12.619 --> 09:14.219
so everybody could have
a good place to live,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.421
and it backfired on you.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.790
Nothing feels safe.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.725
You're my last hope.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.994
It sounds like it.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.366
I'm getting all kinds
of crazy in here.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.268
It's this damn old man.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.537
He likes this room a lot.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.972
He looks better.

09:33.974 --> 09:38.510
I think he's reverting
to a stage before he got sick.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.478
I think he thinks
this is his room.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.613
How would he affect
the living?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.615
He likes to jump on the bed.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.419
You know, he likes to watch
the television,

09:47.421 --> 09:48.520
so I think, for the living,

09:48.522 --> 09:52.857
the TV would come on
and off by itself.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.628
This room is just filled with
a dead person's energy,

09:56.630 --> 10:02.167
and I think it's making
the person sick and throwing up.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.870
And for a living person to be
exposed to that for a long time,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.306
they're absorbing
way too much dead energy.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.976
It would be extremely
detrimental.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.744
They're dying.

10:31.955 --> 10:33.688
So, Will,
Mom said you're 14.

10:33.690 --> 10:35.022
Yep.

10:35.024 --> 10:37.592
Did you ever experience
anything you can't explain?

10:37.594 --> 10:41.829
Sometimes, like, I'll get
this uncertain feeling in here

10:41.831 --> 10:44.599
like there's just constantly
somebody just stalking me,

10:44.601 --> 10:46.134
just always watching me.

10:46.136 --> 10:48.403
You feel like it's a man
or a thing?

10:48.405 --> 10:50.505
I haven't really
put a label on it.

10:50.507 --> 10:51.873
Okay. Anything else?

10:51.875 --> 10:54.609
Yeah. I was sitting
in front of the TV,

10:54.611 --> 10:57.044
and it looked like somebody kept
on popping around the corner.

10:57.046 --> 10:58.479
Can you describe him for me?

10:58.481 --> 11:02.850
I mean, it was like a black
figure kept on looking at me.

11:02.852 --> 11:04.285
How did you react
when you saw this thing?

11:04.287 --> 11:06.053
It really freaked me out.

11:06.055 --> 11:08.122
I mean, I know I wasn't
just seeing things.

11:08.124 --> 11:09.357
I knew it was there.

11:09.359 --> 11:11.893
What do you think
this thing wants?

11:11.895 --> 11:15.263
I think they're just somebody
just trying to pick

11:15.265 --> 11:16.497
on the family, really,

11:16.499 --> 11:19.400
just trying to tell us,

11:19.402 --> 11:21.903
basically, "Get out."

11:31.181 --> 11:34.816
This feels horrible in here!

11:37.821 --> 11:40.455
God, I feel so sick. Okay.

11:40.457 --> 11:42.223
Constant nausea.

11:42.225 --> 11:46.694
The person in here has abilities
without a doubt,

11:46.696 --> 11:49.096
probably mediumship,
I'm thinking.

11:49.098 --> 11:55.536
I see a war between whoever
is in here and the old man.

11:58.441 --> 12:00.475
The old man is sitting
by the bed,

12:00.477 --> 12:04.912
whispering into their ear --

12:04.914 --> 12:10.051
disrespectful, lazy, stupid --

12:10.053 --> 12:15.022
everything this old man disliked
of anybody when he was alive.

12:15.024 --> 12:18.759
He thinks that this person
is a waste of space.

12:18.761 --> 12:21.796
I feel like he is
physically doing things,

12:21.798 --> 12:23.998
flicking their ear
and their head...

12:25.835 --> 12:28.569
...smacking 'em, pushing.

12:30.707 --> 12:33.341
What would the long-term effects
be for this living person?

12:33.343 --> 12:39.313
Giving them horrible nightmares,
anxiety issues,

12:39.315 --> 12:41.883
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

12:41.885 --> 12:44.752
The dead guys just
wants them the...out.

12:50.894 --> 12:52.260
So, Amber, I was
talking to your mom.

12:52.262 --> 12:53.628
She thinks that
whatever is here

12:53.630 --> 12:55.663
is going after you
and your brothers.

12:55.665 --> 12:58.065
- You agree with her?
-100%.

12:58.067 --> 13:01.102
I'm terrified for my family.
Okay.

13:01.104 --> 13:03.304
So tell me about
some of the experiences.

13:03.306 --> 13:06.340
I was looking in the mirror
in my bathroom,

13:06.342 --> 13:08.142
and out of the corner
of my eye,

13:08.144 --> 13:11.812
I saw something zoom
past down the hallway.

13:11.814 --> 13:13.014
And what was it?

13:13.016 --> 13:17.184
It was a dark,
shadowy figure.

13:17.186 --> 13:19.420
So I know you saw it quick,
but can you get a sense

13:19.422 --> 13:21.088
if it was an adult
or a kid?

13:21.090 --> 13:22.490
I'm thinking it was adult.

13:22.492 --> 13:25.259
I think it was male
because it was kind of taller.

13:25.261 --> 13:27.061
And you're sure it wasn't
coming from somebody else?

13:27.063 --> 13:29.363
No, everybody was asleep.

13:29.365 --> 13:30.831
Anything else?

13:30.833 --> 13:32.567
I feel someone watching me

13:32.569 --> 13:34.869
or being around me
all the time.

13:34.871 --> 13:37.872
Okay. So is the presence
like a peeping Tom,

13:37.874 --> 13:39.640
or is it, like,
somebody trying to hurt you?

13:39.642 --> 13:41.108
It's kind of just like
somebody is, like,

13:41.110 --> 13:42.577
staring at me all the time.

13:42.579 --> 13:45.746
It's, like, stalking,
and it just watches me.

13:45.748 --> 13:47.582
It doesn't matter where
I'm at in the house.

13:47.584 --> 13:50.484
It's always, like,
right there.

13:50.486 --> 13:51.819
And it's only
when you're here?

13:51.821 --> 13:53.521
- Mnh-mnh.
- Okay.

13:53.523 --> 13:55.356
I went to work the other day
in Knoxville,

13:55.358 --> 13:57.391
and it followed me there.

13:57.393 --> 14:00.595
It was the same presence
as it is at the house.

14:00.597 --> 14:03.130
- Okay. Anything else?
- I have nightmares.

14:03.132 --> 14:04.632
Can you describe 'em?

14:04.634 --> 14:07.668
One in particular that I had,
all the doors were rattling,

14:07.670 --> 14:09.337
and when I woke up,
I was telling it

14:09.339 --> 14:10.805
to get out of the house.

14:10.807 --> 14:12.340
What were you
telling to get out?

14:12.342 --> 14:14.709
I don't know. It was
something very mean, though.

14:14.711 --> 14:16.510
I woke up shaking.

14:16.512 --> 14:17.979
Anything else?

14:17.981 --> 14:21.315
I was laying in bed, and I had,
like, my hand up like this,

14:21.317 --> 14:23.417
and something just
touched my elbow.

14:23.419 --> 14:25.553
So what kind of touch? Did it
feel like a man's finger?

14:25.555 --> 14:28.222
Yeah.
You ever get touched
like that again?

14:28.224 --> 14:31.125
Actually, about a month ago,
I got scratched.

14:31.127 --> 14:33.961
I felt a burning sensation
on the back of my calf,

14:33.963 --> 14:36.263
and when I had looked, it was
a whole bunch of scratches,

14:36.265 --> 14:37.665
and I have a photo.

14:42.672 --> 14:44.405
And what do you think
is in this house?

14:44.407 --> 14:46.307
Something very mean,

14:46.309 --> 14:49.310
um, and it's trying to hurt
my family.

14:51.614 --> 14:53.981
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks.

14:55.218 --> 14:57.018
I just want it gone.

15:01.824 --> 15:06.127
There's another dead guy here
who claims to be a cowboy.

15:06.129 --> 15:08.663
He's a predator.

15:11.534 --> 15:14.402
I think that he's a sick...

15:14.404 --> 15:17.471
I'm seeing him with this girl.

15:17.473 --> 15:19.407
I don't know if this is
this girl or some girl

15:19.409 --> 15:21.609
he had when he was alive,

15:21.611 --> 15:25.179
but she is uncomfortable
and is not happy now,

15:25.181 --> 15:27.581
knowing that this is not right.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.684
Is he able to physically
interact with the living?

15:29.686 --> 15:31.218
I think so, yes.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.120
There is a molestation there.

15:35.191 --> 15:37.591
So this person here,
I would assume,

15:37.593 --> 15:39.727
would have horrible nightmares,

15:39.729 --> 15:43.497
screaming, scared, seeing a man.

15:43.499 --> 15:46.233
I'm worried. I'm just worried.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.369
I feel sick again.

16:02.047 --> 16:04.915
Leonora told me a previous
owner died in her house.

16:04.917 --> 16:07.384
Now the local police
aren't cooperating,

16:07.386 --> 16:10.120
so I had a P.I.
look into it for me.

16:10.122 --> 16:12.356
He just called back
and says it's true.

16:12.358 --> 16:15.025
I'm on my way to meet him now to
find out exactly what happened.

16:22.001 --> 16:24.234
Eddie, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

16:24.236 --> 16:25.669
What were you able
to find out about

16:25.671 --> 16:27.771
the previous owners
of my client's property?

16:27.773 --> 16:30.407
Kenneth and Patricia Goodykoontz
was a married couple.

16:30.409 --> 16:35.612
They bought your client's
residence in 1964.

16:35.614 --> 16:37.481
This is a picture of Kenneth.

16:39.518 --> 16:42.119
- He was retired Air Force.
- Okay.

16:42.121 --> 16:43.420
And he worked as
a local machinist.

16:43.422 --> 16:45.622
All right. So what do
we know about Patricia?

16:45.624 --> 16:48.625
She worked at a local
manufacturing company.

16:48.627 --> 16:51.094
On the phone, you said they
lived there for over 40 years.

16:51.096 --> 16:53.197
Was their time there
good, bad?

16:53.199 --> 16:55.199
Well, there was
some hardships there.

16:55.201 --> 16:57.334
Kenneth lost his mother,
his father,

16:57.336 --> 17:00.103
lost his sister,
lost his brother.

17:00.105 --> 17:02.239
This guy practically
lost his whole family.

17:02.241 --> 17:04.374
So how does Kenneth
wind up dying?

17:04.376 --> 17:06.108
He was diagnosed with cancer.

17:06.111 --> 17:09.179
Well, he finally dies
in May 2006,

17:09.181 --> 17:12.148
right there on
your client's property.

17:12.151 --> 17:13.550
So how old was he
when he died?

17:13.551 --> 17:16.220
- He was 74 years old.
- Okay.

17:16.222 --> 17:17.721
So what about Patricia?
Does she stay in the house?

17:17.723 --> 17:20.257
Yes, and she also
died there as well.

17:20.259 --> 17:22.960
All right. So what were
the circumstances of her death?

17:22.962 --> 17:24.194
Well, August 18, 2015,

17:24.195 --> 17:26.128
the family hadn't heard
from her,

17:26.131 --> 17:29.166
so they sent the local sheriff
out for a welfare check.

17:29.168 --> 17:30.667
What's he find?

17:30.669 --> 17:33.871
He found Patricia's dead body
laying on the living room floor.

17:33.873 --> 17:37.407
- Okay.
- Here's the incident report.

17:39.578 --> 17:42.012
Okay. All right.
So she was 77.

17:42.014 --> 17:44.448
What was the official
cause of death?

17:44.450 --> 17:46.783
Unfortunately,
the coroner's office

17:46.785 --> 17:49.753
never revealed
a reason of death.

17:52.591 --> 17:55.792
He's blocking me on this.

17:55.794 --> 17:59.830
I'm trying to figure out who
this angry, old man was in life.

17:59.832 --> 18:01.064
Can you describe him?

18:01.066 --> 18:04.501
He's, like, 5'5", rail thin.

18:04.503 --> 18:07.070
He's white. He's bald.

18:07.072 --> 18:09.973
I think he had
a <i> really</i> hard life.

18:12.611 --> 18:17.114
I'm seeing him from two
different stages of his life.

18:17.116 --> 18:20.450
When he's looking healthier,

18:20.452 --> 18:22.886
I feel the 1980s.

18:22.888 --> 18:27.858
I would say that he was in his
late 40s, early 50s then.

18:27.860 --> 18:32.829
I think he was in his late 70s
when he's dying or dead.

18:32.831 --> 18:36.033
He looks <i> extremely</i> ill.

18:36.035 --> 18:38.502
Does he have any kind of
connection to the property?

18:38.504 --> 18:41.705
He probably owned it, I guess.

18:41.707 --> 18:45.409
I think he died here
or, like, was dying here.

18:45.411 --> 18:48.145
I'm thinking that he probably
died from cancer.

18:51.951 --> 18:55.085
There was a whole --
another person talking.

18:55.087 --> 18:56.553
It's a dead chick.

18:56.555 --> 19:00.958
It seems like it was some kind
of housewife or some...

19:00.960 --> 19:03.493
The chick was crying
and screaming over it.

19:05.497 --> 19:07.331
That is not good.

19:11.003 --> 19:13.070
So far, I've got
a family being terrorized

19:13.072 --> 19:14.938
by physical attacks
on a property

19:14.940 --> 19:17.841
where the previous owners
died in the house,

19:17.843 --> 19:20.310
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

19:20.312 --> 19:21.645
Searching through old records,

19:21.647 --> 19:25.082
I find an article about a man
name Richard Drummond.

19:25.084 --> 19:28.352
Turns out Richard was hanged
by an angry mob in the 1890s

19:28.354 --> 19:30.520
less than a mile
from my client's property.

19:33.959 --> 19:36.793
I need to know more about this
hanging near Leonora's house.

19:36.795 --> 19:38.795
Heading over to meet
with an historian

19:38.797 --> 19:41.832
who says the whole thing started
with a fight at a brothel.

19:46.972 --> 19:48.105
Well, Stephanie,
thanks for meeting with me.

19:48.107 --> 19:50.040
I appreciate that.

19:50.042 --> 19:51.408
Now this guy,
Richard Drummond,

19:51.410 --> 19:53.744
I know he got hung pretty close
to my client's property.

19:53.746 --> 19:54.945
What were the circumstances?

19:54.947 --> 19:57.914
In 1893, there was the fight
that broke out

19:57.916 --> 19:59.783
in a local brothel
here in Briceville.

19:59.785 --> 20:02.319
All right. So do we know what
started this whole fight?

20:02.321 --> 20:05.355
Some of the soldiers came by
from the nearby Fort Anderson

20:05.357 --> 20:08.091
to enjoy the company of
some ladies at the brothel.

20:08.093 --> 20:09.459
They must have upset somebody

20:09.461 --> 20:13.697
because the local sheriff
was called in to kick them out,

20:13.699 --> 20:16.867
and one of the miners,
named Richard Drummond,

20:16.869 --> 20:18.535
stepped up
to help the sheriff.

20:18.537 --> 20:21.238
And I actually have
a picture of him.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.407
Drummond is helping the sheriff.
What happens next?

20:23.409 --> 20:24.474
Richard Drummond
and the sheriff

20:24.476 --> 20:26.677
were trying to get
the militia out.

20:26.679 --> 20:30.147
In the melee that happened,
Richard Drummond shot and killed

20:30.149 --> 20:32.149
a private named
William Laugherty.

20:32.151 --> 20:34.651
- Does the sheriff arrest him?
- No, he didn't.

20:34.653 --> 20:37.354
Okay. So now Drummond is free.
What happens next?

20:37.356 --> 20:41.058
Well, 2 days later, 16 of
William Laugherty's friends

20:41.060 --> 20:43.627
from the fort
rounded up Richard Drummond

20:43.629 --> 20:47.464
and hung him from the bridge.
- All right.

20:47.466 --> 20:48.699
And how far was that bridge
from my client's house?

20:48.701 --> 20:50.901
About 4,000 feet
from your client's property.

20:50.903 --> 20:52.669
Okay. So his buddies
came back for revenge.

20:52.671 --> 20:53.904
Yes, they did.

20:53.906 --> 20:55.839
As a matter of fact,
Richard Drummond is buried

20:55.841 --> 20:57.541
in an unmarked grave
in this cemetery.

20:57.543 --> 21:00.977
- Right here?
- Yes.

21:00.979 --> 21:03.447
Okay. So did they wind up
arresting the soldiers?

21:03.449 --> 21:05.115
Yes, they did, but in
the middle of the trial,

21:05.117 --> 21:07.617
they dropped the charges.
- Any reason why?

21:07.619 --> 21:10.654
Well, it seems that the military
at the state level

21:10.656 --> 21:14.057
had enough clout to stop
the trial mid-trial.

21:16.161 --> 21:18.695
Nobody goes to jail
for any of this?
No.

21:21.767 --> 21:25.202
I'm seeing that
creepy cowboy guy again.

21:25.204 --> 21:27.137
He's all, like, dressed up.

21:27.139 --> 21:30.807
His outfit looks like
he just went to, like,

21:30.809 --> 21:33.176
a cowboy nightclub
or something.

21:33.178 --> 21:34.878
Any idea when this is?

21:34.880 --> 21:38.081
He was saying that

21:38.083 --> 21:39.816
he was around here

21:39.818 --> 21:41.785
in the 1850s.

21:41.787 --> 21:44.755
I'm skeptical about his claim

21:44.757 --> 21:47.958
to have been
from that time period.

21:54.733 --> 21:58.034
This guy comes and goes.

21:58.036 --> 22:00.704
He comes from somewhere else,

22:00.706 --> 22:03.406
like a bar.

22:03.408 --> 22:06.109
He used to go there.
I think that's where he died.

22:06.111 --> 22:09.446
He's saying that somebody
shot his head off.

22:09.448 --> 22:11.748
There's something sexual
with him,

22:11.750 --> 22:15.719
and he likes them young,
if you know what I mean.

22:15.721 --> 22:19.289
He goes out hunting,
just like any pedophile.

22:19.291 --> 22:21.892
Back in his day,
it wasn't a big deal, though.

22:21.894 --> 22:25.362
That wasn't a thing
that he was persecuted for.

22:25.364 --> 22:27.430
He got shot.
He...deserved it.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.707

22:58.236 --> 23:00.670
You know, another thing
caught my eye in research.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.707
There used to be a coal mine
right near my client's house.

23:03.709 --> 23:07.444
Now, in 1911, there was
a massive explosion there.

23:07.446 --> 23:09.946
I'm on my way to meet with
a local historian who says

23:09.948 --> 23:12.115
it was one of the deadliest
coal-mining accidents

23:12.117 --> 23:13.450
in U.S. history.

23:21.793 --> 23:24.127
So, Boomer, this explosion
I came across,

23:24.129 --> 23:26.396
it looks like it happened pretty
close to my client's property.

23:26.398 --> 23:27.764
What can you tell me
about it?

23:27.766 --> 23:29.399
The entrance of
the Cross Mountain mine

23:29.401 --> 23:31.701
was an adjacent ridge
about a mile

23:31.703 --> 23:33.603
from where your property
your investigating is.

23:33.605 --> 23:36.106
Okay.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.474
...mile and miles of them.

23:37.476 --> 23:39.309
It's very possible that some
of them might have gone

23:39.311 --> 23:41.978
right underneath the property
your investigating.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.146
So, Boomer, do me a favor.

23:43.148 --> 23:44.481
Take me through the day
of the accident.

23:44.483 --> 23:45.749
What happened?

23:45.751 --> 23:49.452
December 9, 1911,
early in the morning, 7:20 a.m.,

23:49.454 --> 23:51.187
the first shift of 89 miners

23:51.189 --> 23:53.256
went into the depths
of the mine,

23:53.258 --> 23:54.591
and shortly after
they entered the mine,

23:54.593 --> 23:56.359
there was a violent explosion.

23:56.361 --> 23:58.261
I mean, how massive was it?

23:58.263 --> 23:59.863
It was massive enough
to be felt, you know,

23:59.865 --> 24:01.598
miles away in all directions

24:01.600 --> 24:04.601
and, you know, shook
the mountainside basically.

24:04.603 --> 24:05.802
Big smoke cloud, you know,

24:05.804 --> 24:07.370
boiled out of
the entrance of the mine

24:07.372 --> 24:09.105
probably 100 feet in the air.

24:12.811 --> 24:14.544
And people came
from all over

24:14.546 --> 24:16.446
the adjacent mining camps,
trying to help.

24:16.448 --> 24:18.882
For the most part,
they were unsuccessful.

24:18.884 --> 24:20.984
You know, here's a photograph
shows a lot of the rescue teams

24:20.986 --> 24:23.086
that had been gathered
around the front of the mine

24:23.088 --> 24:24.988
to see what
they could do to help.

24:24.990 --> 24:27.424
Wow. Everybody came together
during this explosion?

24:27.426 --> 24:29.659
Yeah, during disasters
like that,

24:29.661 --> 24:31.461
miners will come
from the other mines,

24:31.463 --> 24:33.763
you know, the competing mines
to help their brother miners,

24:33.765 --> 24:34.998
any help they could.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.200
All right. Boomer,
so 89 men go down there.

24:37.202 --> 24:38.234
How many get out?

24:38.236 --> 24:40.804
They were able
to rescue five men.

24:40.806 --> 24:42.939
Some of the tunnels
partially collapsed.

24:47.479 --> 24:49.312
...anybody that wasn't killed
by the explosion

24:49.314 --> 24:51.014
suffocated to death.

24:51.016 --> 24:52.582
5 guys are alive,
84 dead.

24:52.584 --> 24:54.117
Any of those bodies
get recovered?

24:54.119 --> 24:56.553
It took 9 days to get everybody
out of the mountain,

24:56.555 --> 24:58.521
but they were able to get
all the victims out.

24:58.523 --> 25:00.190
Some were burnt
beyond recognition,

25:00.192 --> 25:01.925
but the last two that were found

25:01.927 --> 25:03.426
had barricaded
themselves off and hoped,

25:03.428 --> 25:05.228
but the rescue never came.

25:05.230 --> 25:06.362
They were too far back
in the mountain.

25:06.364 --> 25:08.264
They couldn't
get to them in time.

25:08.266 --> 25:12.168
Jeez.
What a horrible way to go.

25:14.439 --> 25:16.172
So I'm getting a lot
of death.

25:20.212 --> 25:23.513
There's bodies on the floor,

25:23.515 --> 25:27.417
all together
and buried in a hole together.

25:29.921 --> 25:31.855
I don't know what that's about.

25:31.857 --> 25:34.891
And there seem to be
a lot of stairs.

25:34.893 --> 25:38.261
Everything's a slick,
solid black

25:38.263 --> 25:41.030
that had something to do
with this location.

25:41.032 --> 25:44.400
I'm looking down,
and it turns into soot

25:44.402 --> 25:46.970
and then, like, charcoal.

25:46.972 --> 25:49.272
This is really not good.

25:56.781 --> 26:01.017
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk, but two stood out.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.986
First, the angry old man.

26:02.988 --> 26:07.056
He was probably
in his 40s.

26:07.058 --> 26:09.893
He was balding,
and he kind of had

26:09.895 --> 26:12.495
big round eyes,

26:12.497 --> 26:14.764
heavy lids.

26:16.401 --> 26:18.434
Next, I described
the creepy cowboy

26:18.436 --> 26:20.303
tormenting a living girl.

26:20.305 --> 26:23.806
She is laying.

26:23.808 --> 26:27.977
There's a male in the room.

26:27.979 --> 26:31.614
Well, he is placing his hand
between the girl's legs.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.591
Is this what you saw?

26:41.593 --> 26:42.859
Yes.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.108
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:06.110 --> 27:08.577
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:08.579 --> 27:11.380
and our clients
for the first time.

27:11.382 --> 27:13.215
So, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Leonora.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.050
This is her daughter, Amber.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.853
Leonora is about as dedicated
a mom as I've ever seen.

27:17.855 --> 27:19.955
She bought this house
so her three kids

27:19.957 --> 27:21.423
could have a better life.

27:21.425 --> 27:22.624
I actually have a photo of
the rest of the family

27:22.626 --> 27:24.059
right here.

27:24.061 --> 27:28.897
This is her son, Will, who's 14,
and her son, Easton, who's 4.

27:28.899 --> 27:33.602
Leonora adopted Easton to save
him from a bad living situation,

27:33.604 --> 27:35.504
but with all the activity here,

27:35.506 --> 27:37.038
he's not really
in a safer place.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.942
As a matter of fact, nobody is.

27:40.944 --> 27:42.911
With that being said,
I'm gonna ask Amy to,

27:42.913 --> 27:44.212
talk about her walk for us.

27:47.418 --> 27:51.753
There are a couple dead people
here that I am concerned about.

27:51.755 --> 27:56.658
The first one is an extremely
angry, elderly male.

27:56.660 --> 27:59.895
For whatever reason, his
favorite location in the house

27:59.897 --> 28:02.097
is back bedroom
to the left.

28:02.099 --> 28:04.399
Now the bedroom you're talking
about is Leonora's bedroom,

28:04.401 --> 28:06.334
and that's where
she sleeps with Easton.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.602
Interesting.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.372
One of the things that
really stood out about him

28:10.374 --> 28:13.475
was his distaste
for children.

28:13.477 --> 28:15.911
He referred to them
as "the pests,"

28:15.913 --> 28:19.047
and he takes
a lot of pleasure

28:19.049 --> 28:21.983
in torturing kids.

28:21.985 --> 28:26.388
Tell her how Easton got shoved
and wakes up with the bruises.

28:26.390 --> 28:30.392
I have pictures of bruises
from his rib cage down

28:30.394 --> 28:33.495
that wasn't there
the day before,

28:33.497 --> 28:36.865
and then I watched him walk,
and it looked like

28:36.867 --> 28:40.302
somebody shoved him
really hard from the back.

28:40.304 --> 28:43.171
Okay. Interesting.

28:43.173 --> 28:45.707
Some of the other things
I saw him doing to the living

28:45.709 --> 28:48.310
was him, like,
stomping on the floors

28:48.312 --> 28:51.179
and making
as much noise as possible.

28:51.181 --> 28:55.250
When he's really upset,
he'll throw things.

28:55.252 --> 28:57.519
Describe what happened
with the flashlight to Amy.

28:57.521 --> 29:00.422
It was a square flashlight.

29:00.424 --> 29:04.993
It was sitting on a table,
and it flew off of the table.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.828
Was anybody else
in the room at the time?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.663
My son was asleep.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.799
- Which son?
- William.

29:10.801 --> 29:12.934
Interesting.

29:12.936 --> 29:16.638
I felt like the living
would be able to see him

29:16.640 --> 29:19.074
because he wants you to.

29:19.076 --> 29:20.809
So he would go in
the hallway,

29:20.811 --> 29:23.778
and he would stand
at the end of the hall

29:23.780 --> 29:26.314
and wait for somebody
to come out of their room.

29:26.316 --> 29:28.917
Both of you guys have seen
dark figures in the hallway.

29:28.919 --> 29:30.218
Yes.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.387
I was standing in the bathroom,
facing the mirror,

29:32.389 --> 29:34.489
and I just caught out
of the corner of my eye,

29:34.491 --> 29:38.493
there was a tall, dark
shadow figure moving very fast.

29:38.495 --> 29:40.362
Now, you see it a lot
from your bedroom?

29:40.364 --> 29:42.864
I do.
Yeah, it's very scary.

29:42.866 --> 29:46.668
Also, I saw him really
screwing around a lot

29:46.670 --> 29:48.970
with the television, like,
flipping through channels,

29:48.972 --> 29:52.541
stations changing, the TV
turning on and off by itself.

29:52.543 --> 29:54.409
Tell her what happens
to your TV in your room.

29:54.411 --> 29:56.745
It will come on and off.

29:58.415 --> 30:01.950
He has really put his energy
in that room.

30:01.952 --> 30:04.486
It's dead energy.

30:04.488 --> 30:06.755
It would make you feel
exhausted,

30:06.757 --> 30:08.456
make you sick and nauseous.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.993
It'll just hit me
all of a sudden,

30:11.995 --> 30:14.129
um, come out of nowhere

30:14.131 --> 30:18.967
and, um, just hit me
pretty hard.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.302
And what that does

30:20.304 --> 30:22.971
to a living person
absorbing dead energy

30:22.973 --> 30:25.540
is it's gonna start
slowly killing you.

30:29.012 --> 30:31.479
When I was in
the middle bedroom,

30:31.481 --> 30:35.150
he basically told me
that he has declared war

30:35.152 --> 30:37.919
on the person in that room.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.854
Yeah, that's Will's room.

30:39.856 --> 30:42.657
We all know that room
is the bad room.

30:42.659 --> 30:45.160
He absolutely
just can't stand him.

30:45.162 --> 30:47.295
He specifically said,
"I have hated him

30:47.297 --> 30:49.598
since he first came here."

30:49.600 --> 30:54.436
I saw him flicking his ear,
smacking him in the head.

30:54.438 --> 30:58.540
I saw him try to give this
living person nightmares,

30:58.542 --> 31:01.309
basically him
just being relentless.

31:01.311 --> 31:05.780
To make things worse,
the living person has abilities,

31:05.782 --> 31:09.718
and he is a medium
of some sort,

31:09.720 --> 31:14.556
but it makes him much more
vulnerable to these attacks.

31:14.558 --> 31:18.360
If he's exposed to this
for a long period of time,

31:18.362 --> 31:21.663
he can develop PTSD,
anxiety issues,

31:21.665 --> 31:25.867
depression issues, all of
these kinds of things.

31:25.869 --> 31:29.771
And what the old man
really wants to do

31:29.773 --> 31:33.241
is just get him
out of here.

31:33.243 --> 31:35.276
He said that
he had saw a face.

31:35.278 --> 31:38.380
Like, he wasn't exactly
completely asleep,

31:38.382 --> 31:39.914
and he felt something
was there,

31:39.916 --> 31:43.351
so he had opened his eyes
and saw a face.

31:43.353 --> 31:45.120
Okay. Interesting.

31:45.122 --> 31:47.555
It's very scary
just to think

31:47.557 --> 31:50.525
that this guy hates him
that bad.

31:53.030 --> 31:55.630
Any idea who this guy was
when he was alive?

31:55.632 --> 32:00.268
What I got was that he possibly
owned this place,

32:00.270 --> 32:01.836
that he lived here.

32:01.838 --> 32:05.407
I got the impression that
he had a really hard life.

32:05.409 --> 32:07.742
There were two ages
that I got him at.

32:07.744 --> 32:12.480
When he was elderly,
he was frail and thin,

32:12.482 --> 32:16.651
and then I saw him
in the back bedroom,

32:16.653 --> 32:18.553
and he looked
a lot healthier.

32:18.555 --> 32:20.689
I would say
he was in his 50s.

32:20.691 --> 32:24.959
I got that when he was healthier
was in the '80s, the 1980s,

32:24.961 --> 32:27.729
and I felt like
he died in the house

32:27.731 --> 32:32.467
from either cancer
or kidney issues or both.

32:32.469 --> 32:35.303
I got a pretty good idea of
who the guy is that you saw.

32:35.305 --> 32:37.338
Now the previous owners
of your house

32:37.340 --> 32:41.009
were a couple named Kenneth
and Patricia Goodykoontz.

32:41.011 --> 32:43.211
They bought this place
back in 1964

32:43.213 --> 32:45.246
and lived here
for over 50 years.

32:45.248 --> 32:47.549
You said this guy hates kids.

32:47.551 --> 32:49.350
I can't say for sure
that this guy, Kenneth,

32:49.352 --> 32:51.486
didn't like kids,
but they didn't have any.

32:51.488 --> 32:52.654
You said he had a hard life.

32:52.656 --> 32:54.589
Now he had
a pretty tough time here.

32:54.591 --> 32:56.558
While living in this house,
he lost both his parents.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.760
His sister and his brother died.

32:58.762 --> 33:02.163
You said the guy you saw was
in his 50s during the 1980s.

33:02.165 --> 33:04.933
Kenneth turned 50 in 1982.

33:04.935 --> 33:10.805
In 2006, Kenneth was diagnosed
with cancer at the age of 74.

33:10.807 --> 33:13.441
He died in this house
in May of 2006.

33:13.443 --> 33:14.909
Matter of fact,
his wife, Patricia,

33:14.911 --> 33:18.413
also died in this house
9 years later in 2015.

33:18.415 --> 33:20.181
Wow.

33:20.183 --> 33:22.851
I got a photo of Kenneth
when he was younger.

33:28.992 --> 33:30.825
Is it possible this is
the guy you saw?

33:30.827 --> 33:32.727
I did have a sketch done.

33:39.302 --> 33:41.069
Yeah. This is him.

33:44.307 --> 33:46.207
You guys tell me.

33:48.612 --> 33:51.212
It's very close, yeah.

33:53.784 --> 33:55.817
You think this is the guy
you saw?

33:55.819 --> 33:58.119
Yeah.

33:58.121 --> 34:00.388
This is the...that
hit your kid.

34:00.390 --> 34:05.693
To be so mean to a child,
I can't comprehend it.

34:05.695 --> 34:08.362
He needs to get the hell
out of my house.

34:12.735 --> 34:16.638
So the other person that
I'm worried about is a male.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.540
He's dressed like a cowboy,

34:18.542 --> 34:22.342
but this guy was perfect,
clean-shaven.

34:22.344 --> 34:23.911
I was like,
"That is weird."

34:23.914 --> 34:26.815
And I got that
he was around here

34:26.817 --> 34:29.984
in the 1840s, in the 1850s.

34:29.985 --> 34:34.255
I think that he came
from somewhere else,

34:34.257 --> 34:37.659
like a bar or a saloon,
and I think he died there

34:37.661 --> 34:40.094
and that he was shot
in the head.

34:40.096 --> 34:43.531
I really feel that
he deserved that

34:43.533 --> 34:47.068
and that he should have
gone to hell.

34:47.070 --> 34:49.237
Amy, I gotta tell you,
a few things you talked about

34:49.239 --> 34:52.239
make me think of a guy
I came across in my research.

34:52.242 --> 34:55.143
Back in 1893, there was a man
who was shot and killed

34:55.145 --> 34:58.479
at a brothel right down the hill
here in Briceville.

34:58.481 --> 34:59.914
Now, his name
was William Laugherty,

34:59.916 --> 35:01.549
and he was 33 years old.

35:01.551 --> 35:03.952
Laugherty was a soldier
that was stationed

35:03.954 --> 35:06.054
at Fort Anderson near here.

35:06.056 --> 35:08.857
That might explain
the strange outfit you saw.

35:08.859 --> 35:11.359
One night, Laugherty
and his military friends

35:11.361 --> 35:12.961
were partying
at the brothel in town,

35:12.963 --> 35:14.462
trying to pick up women.

35:14.464 --> 35:16.297
He and his buddies
pissed somebody off,

35:16.299 --> 35:18.566
and they had to call
the sheriff in to kick him out.

35:18.568 --> 35:20.235
The sheriff had a hard time
trying to get him out,

35:20.237 --> 35:23.404
so a local miner jumped in,
and things got worse.

35:23.406 --> 35:25.340
The miner shot
and killed Laugherty.

35:25.342 --> 35:28.676
The sheriff let the miner go,
but 2 days later,

35:28.678 --> 35:31.713
Laugherty's soldier buddies
came back and they lynched him.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.381
What?

35:33.383 --> 35:35.016
This is the article on it.

35:35.018 --> 35:37.085
Now could Laugherty, the guy
who got shot in the bar,

35:37.087 --> 35:38.853
be the man you might have seen?

35:38.855 --> 35:40.588
Yes.

35:40.590 --> 35:41.890
Now you said you were concerned
about this guy.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.324
What's his story?

35:43.326 --> 35:47.028
I got that he is
an extremely sick individual

35:47.030 --> 35:50.598
who prefers young females.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.635
He was an extremely
sexual person,

35:53.637 --> 35:59.874
and I am pretty certain that
he's some kind of a pedophile.

35:59.876 --> 36:03.711
You might have the feeling of
intense fear when he's around.

36:03.713 --> 36:07.649
He's a very dark,
bad person.

36:07.651 --> 36:09.851
He also likes
to influence people

36:09.853 --> 36:13.988
through very vivid nightmares
and night terrors.

36:13.990 --> 36:17.025
All of the things he's doing
to living individuals

36:17.027 --> 36:21.262
is because he's a hunter
and he's on the prowl always.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.830
Amy, Amber's going through

36:22.832 --> 36:24.666
a lot of the things you're
talking about.

36:24.668 --> 36:25.867
Really?

36:25.869 --> 36:27.535
Well, talk about
the nightmares.

36:27.537 --> 36:29.570
I had one nightmare where I was
telling something

36:29.572 --> 36:30.972
to get out of the house,

36:30.974 --> 36:34.909
and I had woke up actually
saying, "Get out of my house."

36:34.911 --> 36:36.611
Now you said this guy
is like a predator, right?

36:36.613 --> 36:37.979
- Yeah.
- Now didn't you tell me

36:37.981 --> 36:40.081
you felt like somebody
in your room was stalking you?

36:40.083 --> 36:41.582
Always, at night, yeah.

36:41.584 --> 36:44.218
He's, like, in the corner,
watching me.

36:44.220 --> 36:47.355
I don't like it at all.
It scares me a lot.

36:47.357 --> 36:49.424
Did this guy
do anything else?

36:49.426 --> 36:50.992
The biggest thing that I got

36:50.994 --> 36:53.494
is that he can
physically touch the living.

36:53.496 --> 36:54.662
Amber has been touched.

36:54.664 --> 36:56.731
She's been scratched.
You know what? Tell Amy.

36:56.733 --> 36:59.834
I felt something behind me.
I felt a burning sensation.

36:59.836 --> 37:01.469
I looked, and there were
a whole bunch of scratches.

37:01.471 --> 37:02.770
Okay.

37:02.772 --> 37:07.976
Also, I saw a disturbing
situation in the back bedroom.

37:07.978 --> 37:11.412
I had a sketch done of what
I saw going on back there.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.950
Jeez.

37:15.952 --> 37:17.885
I'm sorry, ladies. It's...

37:25.261 --> 37:27.462
He's touching my baby.

37:29.566 --> 37:31.566
Could --

37:31.568 --> 37:34.235
could he have touched me
like that without me knowing?

37:35.739 --> 37:38.840
'Cause I don't wanna
be touched like that.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.309
So he's probably the one that
follows me around all the time?

37:41.311 --> 37:43.378
Yeah. Yeah.

37:43.380 --> 37:47.081
Easton has talked about a man
in a white cowboy hat.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.283
He has called him
the Big Guy.

37:49.285 --> 37:52.353
That's not good.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.522
And, like, when you were
talking to me, and you're like,

37:54.524 --> 37:57.158
"Well, he's got bruises and this
and this," and I'm like,

37:57.160 --> 38:00.495
"I know the old man
is not doing that to him."

38:00.497 --> 38:03.031
It's this sick jerk.

38:06.269 --> 38:11.072
I knew some things were going on
with Easton, but I had no idea.

38:11.074 --> 38:15.376
If this monster is going to
terrorize any of my kids,

38:15.378 --> 38:17.078
I feel very guilty.

38:21.117 --> 38:23.651
You okay, sweetie?

38:23.653 --> 38:26.387
I just... I don't
want that to happen to him ever.

38:44.138 --> 38:45.938
So, Leonora, you were worried
your children

38:45.940 --> 38:49.408
were in danger here,
and you are 100% right.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.976
But we still haven't answered
the big question --

38:50.978 --> 38:53.245
Can you stay here safely
with the kids,

38:53.247 --> 38:56.648
or do you need to pack them up
and get the hell out of here?

38:56.650 --> 38:58.350
Now for that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:01.989 --> 39:04.122
There's a lot
you have to do.

39:04.124 --> 39:07.759
The first thing is to bring in
a medium to sit down

39:07.761 --> 39:13.365
and have a very clear discussion
with this elderly man.

39:13.367 --> 39:16.134
They need to go over the fact
that he's deceased.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.170
It's time for him
to move on.

39:18.172 --> 39:19.905
Okay, so now once
the old guy is gone,

39:19.907 --> 39:21.740
is Will gonna stop
getting messed with?

39:21.742 --> 39:25.677
Yes. All that stuff's
gonna stop.

39:25.679 --> 39:29.348
Okay. Now the cowboy.

39:29.350 --> 39:31.350
Obviously, this guy is
just a piece of...

39:31.352 --> 39:33.652
that needs to go, period.

39:33.654 --> 39:36.955
You need to bring in
a male and a female medium

39:36.957 --> 39:40.325
<i>and</i> a demonologist.

39:40.327 --> 39:45.030
Tell the mediums that
it's gonna be a rough one.

39:45.032 --> 39:46.532
He might get physical
with them,

39:46.534 --> 39:49.668
and that's why you have
the demonologist there.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.004
So the demonologist can
step in if this pervert tries

39:52.006 --> 39:54.072
to get rough
with the mediums?

39:54.074 --> 39:56.208
Absolutely.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.809
So it's kind of like,
okay, you know,

39:57.811 --> 39:59.745
"We're going to try
and do this the nice way.

39:59.747 --> 40:03.248
You get pissy, and we got
our big gun here."

40:03.250 --> 40:07.753
Basically, they do
a type of exorcism.

40:07.755 --> 40:09.688
Both of your sons
have abilities.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.890
Will is going to
naturally close down,

40:11.892 --> 40:15.594
but Easton won't, so the last
thing I want you to do

40:15.596 --> 40:19.565
is he needs to see
a child psychotherapist.

40:19.567 --> 40:22.401
He's going to have
experiences,

40:22.403 --> 40:25.704
and it's better to go
through those experiences

40:25.706 --> 40:32.110
with someone that he can
talk to and who can help him.

40:32.112 --> 40:35.914
He needs to learn as many
protection measures

40:35.916 --> 40:37.883
as he possibly can,

40:37.885 --> 40:40.852
and that'll help him
to prevent PTSD,

40:40.854 --> 40:44.590
anxiety, depression,
all of these things.

40:44.592 --> 40:46.558
So when you adopted Easton,

40:46.560 --> 40:49.061
you adopted a lot more
than you thought.

40:49.063 --> 40:50.896
I'd do it again.

40:50.898 --> 40:53.065
Well, you might have saved
this kid's future

40:53.067 --> 40:56.635
by finding out this stuff now.
- Yeah.

40:56.637 --> 40:59.538
I know it's a lot, but you're
gonna take Amy's advice?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.406
Most definitely.

41:01.408 --> 41:03.575
Knowing what to do
to protect us now

41:03.577 --> 41:05.410
and protect Easton
and even Will...

41:05.412 --> 41:06.912
Right.

41:06.914 --> 41:09.581
...they will be a lot better
overall after all this is done.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.950
And I feel like
we have a path now,

41:11.952 --> 41:14.086
a way that we can
make things better

41:14.088 --> 41:18.557
and that I know we can
help Easton in life,

41:18.559 --> 41:20.792
and we will take this journey
right along with him.

41:20.794 --> 41:22.494
It's a lot of work.

41:22.496 --> 41:24.162
- It's worth it.
- Yeah.

41:24.164 --> 41:26.798
He needs to be protected.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.002
I really hope Leonora
and Amber contact a demonologist

41:30.004 --> 41:32.638
and mediums
to remove the old man

41:32.640 --> 41:35.407
and the cowboy
terrorizing their family.

41:35.409 --> 41:38.343
If they do that and get Easton
the help he needs,

41:38.345 --> 41:40.112
they can free their family
of evil

41:40.114 --> 41:42.147
and lead a peaceful life.
