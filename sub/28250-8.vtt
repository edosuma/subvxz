00:01.100 --> 00:03.103
Eight years ago, I was lead prosecutor

00:03.127 --> 00:05.329
on a murder trial
that divided the country.

00:06.270 --> 00:08.313
When the jury found
movie star Sevvy Johnson

00:08.337 --> 00:10.281
not guilty of double homicide,

00:10.305 --> 00:11.880
I was devastated.

00:11.904 --> 00:13.402
You did everything you could, Maya.

00:13.426 --> 00:16.306
I left that life
and everyone in it behind.

00:16.331 --> 00:18.042
But then the unthinkable happened.

00:18.066 --> 00:19.043
He killed again.

00:19.067 --> 00:20.211
You have to come back, Maya.

00:20.235 --> 00:21.746
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.148
Wearing a jacket with
dried blood spatter on it.

00:24.172 --> 00:25.283
Now, this photo

00:25.307 --> 00:27.018
was taken two weeks
before Jessica's murder.

00:27.042 --> 00:28.620
You think a cop planted the jacket?

00:28.644 --> 00:31.356
You found the jacket,
so you are MVP of the week.

00:31.380 --> 00:32.723
He needs to go down.

00:32.747 --> 00:35.026
Tell your bosses that
all my debts will be paid in...

00:36.184 --> 00:37.829
Next time, it'll be the face.

00:37.853 --> 00:41.902
The stalker watches you
from the empty house next door.

00:41.926 --> 00:44.765
Listen to this... This is over,
you sick son of a bitch.

00:44.789 --> 00:47.587
They seemed especially
interested in your witness list.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.723
Who is "they"?

00:49.747 --> 00:50.858
If Wolf thinks he's being investigated,

00:50.882 --> 00:51.943
he's gonna scramble.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.093
Any idea where I should start?

00:53.117 --> 00:55.629
Maya Travis.
Find out what she's got on me.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.350 --> 01:29.830
We'll talk to the neighbors...

01:30.947 --> 01:32.958
Please tell me you found something.

01:32.982 --> 01:35.260
So far all we have is Buck Neal's body.

01:35.284 --> 01:37.395
She has a stalker. It has to be him.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.498
And you're sure you didn't see
anybody else around

01:39.522 --> 01:41.241
- when you found the body?
- Nobody.

01:41.265 --> 01:43.749
Whoever did this, we'll find him.

01:43.773 --> 01:45.537
Well, what should Maya do until then?

01:45.561 --> 01:48.137
- She's obviously in danger.
- I agree,

01:48.161 --> 01:50.663
so I'm sticking a uniform on her
until we catch him.

01:50.688 --> 01:52.399
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Great.

01:52.423 --> 01:54.303
I'll show you where he put
the bug in the house.

01:54.826 --> 01:56.633
That's good. God, Riv,

01:56.657 --> 01:58.872
if you'd been in the house
and not Buck...

01:58.896 --> 02:00.374
I wasn't.

02:00.398 --> 02:02.209
Hey, I'm fine.

02:04.969 --> 02:06.002
Hey!

02:07.939 --> 02:09.616
You want to explain this?

02:09.640 --> 02:13.006
What the hell was your
investigator doing in my house?

02:13.031 --> 02:14.241
Maybe you should stop pointing fingers.

02:14.265 --> 02:16.343
- A man is dead.
- Because you sent him here.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.345
I had nothing to do with this.

02:18.369 --> 02:20.247
Buck was... not well.

02:20.271 --> 02:21.401
He was acting erratic.

02:21.425 --> 02:23.773
You're lying as usual.
You're unbelievable.

02:26.677 --> 02:27.910
How was he killed?

02:29.614 --> 02:31.700
He was garroted with a wire.

02:33.217 --> 02:34.728
I'm sorry.

02:38.623 --> 02:39.900
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

02:47.598 --> 02:50.511
My God.

02:50.535 --> 02:51.979
Sir! You cannot touch the body.

02:52.003 --> 02:53.514
Get your hands off of me!

03:08.659 --> 03:16.505

03:23.453 --> 03:25.264
Thanks, Evan. I'm good from here.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.799
You have my number, Ms. Travis.

03:26.823 --> 03:28.501
Just give me a heads-up
when you're ready to leave.

03:28.525 --> 03:29.702
Okay.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.986
Maya, you're here.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.194
- I'm here.
- I heard what happened.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.415
I can't believe this,
on top of everything.

03:55.685 --> 03:57.964
- I just...
- What?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.466
I wish you'd told me
you were being stalked.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.873
I should have.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.637
Listen, about going into the FBI...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.628
Any other day, I'd be furious.
Today, I'm just...

04:08.164 --> 04:10.031
I'm just glad you're okay.

04:12.802 --> 04:14.113
If you need to take some time...

04:14.137 --> 04:15.815
No, no. I've got protection.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.017
Besides, work will help me
get through this.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.720
Shall we?

04:40.997 --> 04:43.042
Ezra, I'm so sorry.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.377
Tough break.

04:44.401 --> 04:46.779
I'm gonna need you to round up
résumés for a new P.I.

04:46.803 --> 04:49.315
ASAP. And look for a good funeral home.

04:49.339 --> 04:52.084
Not in the valley. Spare no expense.

04:52.108 --> 04:54.487
Sevvy already called, offered to pay.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.389
He said that that's the least he can do

04:56.413 --> 04:57.623
since Buck saved his life.

04:57.647 --> 04:59.058
He's right. It is.

04:59.082 --> 05:00.126
Wait.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.394
What?

05:01.418 --> 05:03.329
There's someone in your office.

05:03.353 --> 05:05.197
I told him to wait, but...

05:08.258 --> 05:09.769
Thanks.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.239
Nemo.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.478
You took time
out of your busy day for me?

05:19.502 --> 05:21.180
I wanted you to feel special.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.917
Yeah, I know. I'm a...

05:24.941 --> 05:27.953
I'm a smidge late
on my payment this week.

05:27.977 --> 05:29.689
Two days late, Wolf.

05:29.713 --> 05:33.926
Meaning the fifty-K that
you owe this week...

05:33.950 --> 05:35.828
just turned into 75.

05:37.157 --> 05:38.386
With interest.

05:39.222 --> 05:40.800
Look, my investigator,

05:40.824 --> 05:41.967
just got himself murdered,

05:41.991 --> 05:43.636
and I had to pay
for the funeral costs. It's...

05:43.660 --> 05:45.793
- I'm so sorry to hear about that.
- Thanks.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.764
But that doesn't change a thing.

05:48.788 --> 05:51.677
$75,000. By tonight.

05:51.701 --> 05:54.639
Or it becomes a funeral for two.

05:58.475 --> 06:00.052
Later, Wolf.

06:21.231 --> 06:23.598
Loni. Welcome back.

06:27.727 --> 06:29.148
You heard the news, right?

06:29.172 --> 06:31.829
- They found Buck Neal's body.
- Yeah.

06:31.853 --> 06:33.686
In Maya's house.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.659
This is our fault, Alan...

06:35.683 --> 06:37.854
Whoa, whoa. Slow your roll. Our fault?

06:37.878 --> 06:39.974
You know Wolf sent Buck there
because I convinced him.

06:39.998 --> 06:42.194
S.I.D. was launching
an investigation into him.

06:42.218 --> 06:44.930
We lied. And now a man is dead.

06:44.954 --> 06:46.603
It is horrible what happened,

06:46.627 --> 06:49.435
but nobody asked him
to break the law, okay?

06:49.459 --> 06:51.804
He got himself killed.

06:52.177 --> 06:53.788
You're really justifying this?

06:53.812 --> 06:55.356
No.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.158
I'm moving on.

06:57.182 --> 07:01.010
Go back to work and forget
about Project Wolf for now.

07:10.295 --> 07:13.808
FBI verified Sevvy's DNA is on
the jacket's collar and sleeves.

07:13.832 --> 07:15.143
It's definitely his.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.478
- What about the blood?
- Confirmed as Jessica Meyer's.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.180
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

07:19.204 --> 07:20.715
Just glad you're back.
How are you feeling?

07:20.739 --> 07:23.151
Antibiotics are a damn miracle.

07:23.175 --> 07:24.796
- I feel much better. Thanks.
- Good.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.646
Then you can check in
with our blood-spatter guy.

07:26.670 --> 07:28.073
See if the pattern's consistent

07:28.097 --> 07:30.124
with Johnson wearing the jacket
during the murder.

07:30.148 --> 07:33.184
Or if it looks like the blood
was put there later, right?

07:33.208 --> 07:34.487
You catch up quick.

07:34.511 --> 07:36.664
We really think Detective North did this?

07:37.230 --> 07:39.642
We all want to be wrong, but I
just got his personnel file.

07:39.666 --> 07:41.844
He took a psych leave
after we lost the trials.

07:41.868 --> 07:43.079
Seems it really messed him up.

07:43.103 --> 07:45.781
And if he did plant the jacket,
what's our play?

07:45.805 --> 07:47.416
There is no play.

07:47.845 --> 07:50.691
The jury will think the LAPD
tried to frame Sevvy.

07:50.715 --> 07:52.426
Then all of our evidence will be tainted.

07:52.450 --> 07:55.023
We'll go into court
with a case we can't win.

07:55.453 --> 07:58.265
But Wiest will dismiss the case
before he lets that happen.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.700
It just sucks to say it out loud.

08:01.087 --> 08:02.531
If only we could figure out

08:02.555 --> 08:03.809
where the hell the jacket came from.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.568
I think I might have a way we can get

08:05.592 --> 08:08.137
- more information on the jacket.
- What's that?

08:08.161 --> 08:10.773
Let's see if Sevvy Johnson
wants to play "Queen for a Day."

08:10.797 --> 08:12.141
Queen for a Day?

08:12.165 --> 08:13.375
Hell no.

08:13.399 --> 08:14.710
What is that?

08:14.734 --> 08:16.345
It's an information-gathering device.

08:16.369 --> 08:18.514
Let's you talk to
the prosecutors off the record.

08:18.538 --> 08:20.883
Nothing you say can be used against you.

08:20.907 --> 08:23.919
Basically, Maya wants to ask you
about this jacket.

08:23.943 --> 08:25.187
Well, what the hell can I tell her?

08:25.211 --> 08:26.755
And I didn't toss any bloody jacket.

08:26.779 --> 08:28.524
Of course you didn't. And Maya knows

08:28.548 --> 08:30.159
- that you wouldn't admit it if you did.
- Look.

08:30.183 --> 08:32.995
Clearly there's something about
that jacket they can't figure out,

08:33.019 --> 08:35.063
and they want you to narrow
down the possibilities.

08:35.087 --> 08:36.932
Forget it. Let her twist
in the damn wind.

08:37.347 --> 08:38.625
You tell her the answer is no.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.027
I agree. It's too risky.

08:40.051 --> 08:41.484
I'll call and let her know.

08:42.886 --> 08:44.020
Stop.

08:46.324 --> 08:47.456
I'll do it.

08:49.285 --> 08:50.771
Weren't you listening?

08:50.795 --> 08:52.339
Georgia and I actually
agree on something.

08:52.363 --> 08:53.340
You're not doing it.

08:53.364 --> 08:55.676
Listen, this is my only chance

08:55.700 --> 08:58.646
to convince Maya Travis once and for all

08:58.670 --> 09:00.314
- that I'm innocent.
- Which you'll never do.

09:00.338 --> 09:03.484
Says you. But you're not in charge.

09:03.982 --> 09:05.693
- Then listen to me...
- And you're not either.

09:05.717 --> 09:07.261
I am.

09:07.285 --> 09:10.664
Tell Travis I'll play.

09:10.688 --> 09:12.933
"King for a Day."

10:02.416 --> 10:04.895
Okay, Ms. Travis.

10:04.919 --> 10:06.685
Ask away.

10:08.485 --> 10:10.533
- First off, we set parameters.
- Agreed.

10:10.558 --> 10:13.486
We're here to talk about
the jacket, and nothing else.

10:13.511 --> 10:15.890
If you start fishing, we walk.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.915
Fine. Let's talk about that jacket.

10:19.017 --> 10:21.996
Lab results showed your DNA
and Jessica's blood were on it.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.048
When was the last time
you wore it, Mr. Johnson?

10:29.563 --> 10:31.272
My stylist sends me stuff.

10:31.779 --> 10:33.890
I put it on. I have no idea
when I wore it.

10:33.914 --> 10:35.440
Let me jog your memory.

10:35.464 --> 10:38.603
Here's a picture of you
wearing it a month ago.

10:40.115 --> 10:43.127
So he forgot his sartorial
choices last month.

10:43.151 --> 10:45.096
Is... Is this going somewhere?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.630
Yes. I want to understand

10:46.654 --> 10:48.599
why the jacket was found off of PCH,

10:48.623 --> 10:50.434
right between the site
of Jessica's murder

10:50.458 --> 10:52.470
and your home, Mr. Johnson.

10:52.494 --> 10:54.972
Someone else must have put it there

10:54.996 --> 10:57.274
because I didn't kill Jessica.

10:57.298 --> 10:58.905
Sevvy, that was not the question.

10:58.929 --> 11:01.145
And even if I had, do you think
I'd really be stupid enough

11:01.169 --> 11:02.680
to leave it on the side of the road?

11:02.704 --> 11:04.248
If you panicked.

11:04.637 --> 11:06.315
Isn't that what happened eight years ago

11:06.339 --> 11:08.417
when you dropped the murder
weapon in a storm drain

11:08.441 --> 11:10.586
- outside of Cassandra's house?
- Enough.

11:10.610 --> 11:12.387
You are way out of bounds.

11:12.411 --> 11:14.756
- Your client opened the door.
- And I'm slamming it shut.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.423
You broke the rules.

11:16.447 --> 11:18.746
Queen for a Day just became
Queen for 60 seconds.

11:18.787 --> 11:19.831
We're done here.

11:19.855 --> 11:21.499
- No.
- No? What do you mean, no?

11:21.523 --> 11:24.602
You two. Out.

11:26.829 --> 11:29.362
I came here to talk to Maya Travis,

11:30.332 --> 11:31.876
and I'm not done yet.

11:40.246 --> 11:41.957
Can't believe you're going at North.

11:41.981 --> 11:44.126
- I never said I was going after North.
- Come on, Carisa.

11:44.150 --> 11:47.095
You and Maya bought him
five rounds last night.

11:47.119 --> 11:49.393
I know that trick. You were pumping him.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.125
But I'm telling you, he ain't your guy.

11:51.150 --> 11:52.528
James, I know he's a buddy
of yours, but you've...

11:52.552 --> 11:55.464
How the hell would he even
get a bloody jacket?

11:56.556 --> 11:58.066
It makes no sense.

11:58.090 --> 11:59.301
He was at Jessica's autopsy.

11:59.325 --> 12:01.436
He had access to her blood,
and he could have gotten

12:01.460 --> 12:03.420
one of Sevvy's jackets
when he searched the house.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.707
Think about what you are doing.

12:06.190 --> 12:09.000
You're gonna burn 15 years
of good will with the LAPD?

12:09.025 --> 12:10.302
That's what you care about now?

12:10.326 --> 12:11.792
My career?

12:13.329 --> 12:16.242
I may not want to live with you,

12:16.266 --> 12:18.410
but I don't want to see you
go down in flames.

12:18.434 --> 12:20.579
And you will, because you are wrong.

12:26.109 --> 12:29.255
Are you sure you want to do this?

12:29.814 --> 12:31.191
I've got nothing to hide.

12:31.215 --> 12:33.527
I'm telling you. I didn't kill her.

12:33.551 --> 12:36.631
Then why was Jessica's blood
on the jacket?

12:36.656 --> 12:38.534
Did you hit her
the last time you wore it?

12:38.558 --> 12:41.036
No. It's not possible.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.205
Come on. I've seen
what you've done to her.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.520
That was the old me.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.522
I changed.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.345
I hate the way I treated Jessica, so...

12:50.369 --> 12:52.981
I went on an intensive
therapy retreat in Ibiza.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.349
That sounds more like a vacation.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.952
It wasn't a bloody vacation!

12:57.408 --> 12:59.855
It was the hardest thing
I'd ever done in my life.

13:00.286 --> 13:03.114
To look at myself... faults, my flaws...

13:03.139 --> 13:05.450
but I saw where my anger was coming from.

13:05.474 --> 13:07.519
And Jess was right there.

13:07.543 --> 13:09.288
Jessica helped me put it under control.

13:09.312 --> 13:10.889
For how long?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.836
Until the next time you got jealous

13:12.861 --> 13:14.138
or had too much to drink?

13:14.162 --> 13:16.963
I never touched her
after that trip, I swear.

13:18.733 --> 13:21.227
Have you ever really been in love, Maya?

13:25.405 --> 13:26.382
It doesn't matter.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.650
This is about you, Mr. Johnson.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.452
It does matter!

13:29.476 --> 13:31.067
Because if you had,

13:31.711 --> 13:33.389
you'd understand.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.324
I would have done anything for Jessica.

13:39.353 --> 13:40.897
This is unbelievable.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.766
This is Sevvy Johnson. To a "T."

13:42.790 --> 13:45.936
You have to learn how to expect
the unexpected.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.671
Charlie. I want some friendly camera time

13:47.695 --> 13:48.705
when we get back to the office.

13:48.729 --> 13:50.295
Promise them something juicy.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.998
Thanks.

13:54.669 --> 13:56.568
Excuse me. I have to use the facilities.

14:09.879 --> 14:11.891
You sent your guy to Maya's house?

14:11.916 --> 14:13.916
- Really?
- I didn't send him anywhere.

14:15.085 --> 14:17.697
I need information.

14:17.721 --> 14:19.099
Who else is S.I.D. talking to?

14:19.123 --> 14:21.535
I told you everything I know.

14:21.559 --> 14:22.736
And haven't you ever heard...

14:22.760 --> 14:25.238
it's not the crime, it's the cover-up?

14:25.262 --> 14:27.774
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

14:34.719 --> 14:36.096
I get it.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.666
You're upset because you lost last time.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.268
You blame yourself, and now you
just want to make up for it.

14:41.777 --> 14:44.556
But you can't do that by putting
an innocent man in jail.

14:44.580 --> 14:49.094
If I want therapy, I'll take
my own trip to Ibiza, thanks.

14:49.118 --> 14:51.463
So if you've got nothing else
to tell me about the jacket...

14:51.487 --> 14:53.965
Listen, I remember this day.

14:53.989 --> 14:57.061
This photo was taken after
I did work on myself,

14:57.086 --> 14:58.564
so I know I didn't touch her.

14:58.588 --> 15:01.605
I put that jacket back in
the closet without a spot on it,

15:01.629 --> 15:03.736
which means someone else
put her blood on it.

15:04.176 --> 15:05.319
Who? Why?

15:05.343 --> 15:07.221
Listen, I don't know!

15:07.245 --> 15:08.623
That's why I'm here.

15:08.647 --> 15:10.958
'Cause the only one who can
help me right now is you.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.664
Thank you for your time, Mr. Johnson.

15:32.371 --> 15:33.749
That was one hell of a show.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.450
We need to get Detective North here.

15:35.474 --> 15:38.320
Tell me you didn't buy
Johnson's "Ibiza cure" story.

15:38.559 --> 15:39.836
I still think he killed her,

15:39.860 --> 15:42.739
but as for the jacket,

15:42.763 --> 15:44.407
I actually believe him.

15:56.236 --> 15:59.315
Ladies and gentlemen,
hell has frozen over.

15:59.339 --> 16:01.317
Even the D.A.'s office now believes

16:01.341 --> 16:04.587
the LAPD is attempting
to frame my client.

16:04.611 --> 16:06.021
They brought in the FBI to investigate

16:06.045 --> 16:08.457
a key piece of evidence
that was clearly planted.

16:08.481 --> 16:10.526
Which means the entire case...

16:10.550 --> 16:13.496
every piece of evidence
brought in by the LAPD...

16:13.520 --> 16:15.331
is tainted and unreliable.

16:15.748 --> 16:17.425
Can you name the officers involved?

16:17.449 --> 16:18.860
Not at this time,
but we're moving forward

16:18.884 --> 16:20.694
- with our investigation.
- Please stop.

16:22.354 --> 16:23.899
I have something I want to say.

16:23.923 --> 16:26.868
- Sevvy, maybe...
- No, it's okay.

16:30.162 --> 16:32.374
You love the drama, don't you?

16:32.398 --> 16:35.043
Lawyers versus lawyers.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.779
Well, I don't give a damn
about any of that.

16:38.270 --> 16:40.448
'Cause the woman I love was murdered.

16:40.472 --> 16:41.816
And I seem to be the only one

16:41.840 --> 16:44.686
who's trying to find the person
that actually killed her,

16:44.710 --> 16:48.623
which is why I'm selling my Malibu home

16:48.647 --> 16:50.058
to put up as a reward.

16:50.082 --> 16:51.326
If anyone comes forward

16:51.350 --> 16:54.963
with information leading
to Jessica's real killer,

16:54.987 --> 16:57.666
I'm willing to offer $18 million

16:57.690 --> 16:59.567
to bring that person to justice.

17:01.193 --> 17:04.071
Please, help me find who killed my love.

17:04.096 --> 17:05.640
And how do you intend
to verify the claim?

17:05.664 --> 17:08.042
Is the D.A.'s office aware of your offer?

17:11.632 --> 17:14.281
Thanks, Robbie.
Our big story this hour...

17:14.306 --> 17:17.660
Sevvy Johnson's emotional
appeal has people seeing green.

17:17.685 --> 17:21.714
The former mega-movie-star
promised an $18 million reward

17:21.739 --> 17:24.483
to anyone who has information
leading to the arrest...

17:24.509 --> 17:25.819
of his late girlfriend,

17:25.844 --> 17:27.387
Jessica Meyer's...

17:33.218 --> 17:35.218
- Gabe, are you okay?
- I needed to see you.

17:35.242 --> 17:36.865
I've been sitting in that motel room

17:36.889 --> 17:38.399
alone for days, and I-I can't...

17:38.423 --> 17:40.774
- Come inside.
- I can't take any more.

17:41.426 --> 17:44.223
How can you stand it?!

17:44.248 --> 17:45.692
After all the years
you've spent defending him,

17:45.716 --> 17:47.794
he's gonna accuse you of killing Jessica?

17:47.818 --> 17:49.162
You're right.

17:49.186 --> 17:51.865
I spent decades defending that man.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.412
But I'm done!

17:54.205 --> 17:56.236
He never deserved you.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.039
Now he wants the whole world
to think he's some hero?

17:59.506 --> 18:01.283
'Cause he's out there searching
for Jessica's killer

18:01.307 --> 18:02.785
when we know... I know what he did,

18:02.809 --> 18:04.220
and he's never gonna pay for it!

18:04.244 --> 18:06.055
He will pay.

18:06.079 --> 18:07.923
His time is coming, but...

18:07.947 --> 18:10.359
you have to pull it together.

18:10.383 --> 18:11.494
Sevvy has all of the power.

18:11.518 --> 18:12.728
He's a murderer, and he's out there.

18:12.752 --> 18:14.196
He's just living his life!

18:14.220 --> 18:16.732
But I got to hide away?

18:16.756 --> 18:20.272
He does not have all the power.

18:21.206 --> 18:24.068
You, Gabe... you have the power.

18:24.809 --> 18:26.287
What you know,

18:26.311 --> 18:28.089
what you saw in that bag...

18:28.113 --> 18:29.190
that's what's gonna put him away.

18:29.214 --> 18:31.892
But you cannot fall apart. Not now.

18:32.326 --> 18:34.962
Don't let him take any more from you

18:35.412 --> 18:36.845
than he already has.

18:38.265 --> 18:39.843
Forget the motel.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.086
Stay here with me.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.505
We're in this together.

18:49.877 --> 18:50.921
That's progress.

18:50.945 --> 18:52.188
One man's progress...

18:52.212 --> 18:53.723
is another man's pain in the ass.

18:54.238 --> 18:57.551
Look, this stunt is foolish.

18:57.576 --> 18:59.888
This stunt is gonna help us
find the real killer.

18:59.912 --> 19:02.056
No, it's going to bring out the crazies

19:02.080 --> 19:03.992
and bury us in dead-end leads.

19:04.016 --> 19:05.660
- The keys you asked for.
- Thank you.

19:05.684 --> 19:07.250
No, no, no, no.

19:08.487 --> 19:10.331
We need to shut this down.

19:10.355 --> 19:13.334
Georgia, you're gonna have to
learn how to roll with the punches.

19:13.358 --> 19:15.870
- But...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:15.894 --> 19:17.172
You're leaving now?

19:17.196 --> 19:18.947
Just got to take care of one thing.

19:18.972 --> 19:20.783
If one of those crazies comes through,

19:20.807 --> 19:22.127
you make sure you give me a call.

19:29.582 --> 19:31.594
Thanks for coming in.

19:32.029 --> 19:34.008
I'd like to know why you sent
that jacket to the FBI.

19:34.032 --> 19:35.477
Well, that's a key piece of evidence.

19:35.501 --> 19:37.012
It needed to be unassailable.

19:37.116 --> 19:38.293
Whatever.

19:38.317 --> 19:40.362
We just want to ask you
a couple questions.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.996
About what? I filed a full report.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.065
You found the jacket on
Monday morning, right?

19:44.089 --> 19:46.801
Yep. Got that call from
that uni, Officer Sloan.

19:46.825 --> 19:48.465
Did anybody go out to the scene with you?

19:48.711 --> 19:50.255
Nope. Went solo.

19:50.279 --> 19:51.823
Met Sloan just after they finished

19:51.847 --> 19:52.858
their encampment sweeps.

19:52.882 --> 19:55.327
- Had you worked with him before?
- Never.

19:55.765 --> 19:57.576
What about the homeless guy
who found the jacket?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.977
You ever dealt with him before?

19:59.001 --> 20:00.145
Nope.

20:00.169 --> 20:01.880
Haven't done sweeps since I was a uni.

20:01.904 --> 20:03.816
Good to know. So you were on the scene

20:03.840 --> 20:05.884
of Cassandra and Nancy's murder
nine years ago?

20:05.908 --> 20:07.619
Yeah, I was one of
the first on the scene.

20:07.855 --> 20:09.433
Had to get those kids out of there.

20:09.457 --> 20:11.602
- It was rough.
- I can imagine.

20:11.626 --> 20:13.237
Is that why you took
a four-month psych leave

20:13.261 --> 20:14.905
after the verdict?

20:14.929 --> 20:16.307
Now hold up.

20:16.570 --> 20:18.114
- I'm just trying to understand.
- No, no.

20:18.138 --> 20:19.315
It feels like
you're trying to trap me here.

20:19.339 --> 20:21.784
- Nobody's trying to trap you.
- Screw you, okay?

20:21.808 --> 20:24.086
You want to talk to me again?

20:24.110 --> 20:26.188
Call my union rep.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.860
Thank you, old friend.

22:25.593 --> 22:27.811
Charlie? Get me Nemo.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.067
You know what? Scratch that.

22:32.092 --> 22:34.437
Get me the sports book at the Bellagio.

22:37.212 --> 22:39.657
- Thanks for coming in.
- Any leads on the stalker?

22:39.681 --> 22:41.192
Not yet, but we've decided

22:41.216 --> 22:43.161
to widen the scope of the investigation.

22:43.185 --> 22:44.228
Meaning?

22:44.252 --> 22:46.431
Things may take longer than we thought.

22:46.818 --> 22:49.196
- Well, how much longer are we talking?
- Well, it's hard to say.

22:49.220 --> 22:51.398
It seems Ms. Travis has a lot of enemies,

22:51.422 --> 22:55.269
and we don't want to eliminate
other possible suspects.

22:55.293 --> 22:57.404
You found the body, right?

22:57.428 --> 22:58.939
May need to talk to you more about that.

22:58.963 --> 23:00.307
You can't be insinuating that he...

23:00.331 --> 23:03.243
Just exploring all possibilities.

23:03.267 --> 23:06.080
Wouldn't want to falsely accuse
anyone of anything, right?

23:06.104 --> 23:08.582
This is payback.
You're slow-walking my case

23:08.606 --> 23:10.517
because I'm looking into Detective North.

23:10.541 --> 23:12.186
Are you kidding me?

23:12.210 --> 23:14.621
- You can't pull this.
- And, unfortunately,

23:14.645 --> 23:16.156
we can't afford to keep the uniform

23:16.180 --> 23:18.320
on protection detail anymore either.

23:18.883 --> 23:20.694
Sorry about that.

23:20.718 --> 23:23.163
I'll let you know
if we make any progress.

23:23.187 --> 23:25.366
Until then, you're on your own.

23:33.535 --> 23:35.780
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure. What's up?

23:35.804 --> 23:38.382
So, LAPD is stalling

23:38.406 --> 23:40.539
the investigation into Maya's stalker.

23:41.759 --> 23:44.141
- Cause you guys...
- Are investigating into North.

23:44.165 --> 23:47.579
Years of leaving gifts at her doorstep,

23:47.604 --> 23:49.348
bugging the house. He just murdered a man

23:49.372 --> 23:51.016
in Maya's living room for God's sake,

23:51.040 --> 23:52.518
and the police could give a damn!

23:52.542 --> 23:53.686
Wait, wait, wait.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.254
He bugged the house?

23:55.278 --> 23:56.844
What? You didn't know that?

23:58.214 --> 24:01.327
No, Maya's not big on sharing.

24:01.351 --> 24:03.028
What do you want me to do?

24:03.657 --> 24:05.531
You know people.

24:05.701 --> 24:07.635
Call in a favor, pull a string.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.972
I don't care. Just do
whatever you have to do

24:09.996 --> 24:12.240
to get LAPD back on track.

24:12.264 --> 24:14.443
The politics right now are touchy.

24:14.935 --> 24:16.962
If it weren't for you,

24:17.504 --> 24:20.505
Maya would be up in Washington
right now, safe.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.677
I know you care about her,

24:24.578 --> 24:26.556
so just help her.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.112
You owe her that much.

24:32.494 --> 24:34.427
Did you hear back from
the blood-spatter guy?

24:37.699 --> 24:38.876
Loni?

24:38.900 --> 24:41.846
Did you know that Buck Neal
was a foster kid?

24:41.870 --> 24:43.481
He grew up in Alabama.

24:43.505 --> 24:46.284
You know this is urgent, right?

24:46.308 --> 24:48.619
The analyst isn't available
until tomorrow.

24:49.219 --> 24:51.219
And you didn't bother
to find another one?

24:52.990 --> 24:54.934
You say you're a great lawyer,

24:54.958 --> 24:58.471
better than me, that I need
to utilize my team.

24:58.495 --> 25:00.774
And then you disappear
at the most crucial time.

25:00.798 --> 25:03.143
I need the Loni that busted my chops

25:03.167 --> 25:04.466
when I first got here.

25:06.370 --> 25:08.314
Where the hell is she?

25:08.338 --> 25:10.617
There's something I need to tell you.

25:27.424 --> 25:29.035
First and 10, here we go.

25:31.495 --> 25:33.306
This guy, hey... Watch the running back.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.311
There he goes.
There he goes! There he goes!

25:38.335 --> 25:39.846
There he... There it is!

25:43.398 --> 25:45.109
- Let's break it down.
- Come on, boy!

25:45.133 --> 25:47.412
That's right.
They're gonna throw backside.

25:47.436 --> 25:48.846
Here we go. Wolfie!

25:48.870 --> 25:50.014
What's up, brother?

25:50.038 --> 25:51.149
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

25:51.173 --> 25:52.557
Come watch the game with us.

25:53.408 --> 25:54.852
You should have called ahead.

25:54.876 --> 25:55.853
I would have ordered pizza.

25:55.877 --> 25:57.789
Don't worry about it.

25:57.813 --> 26:00.158
We, We helped ourselves.

26:00.182 --> 26:01.942
Hey, man. Have a seat.

26:04.886 --> 26:07.331
So it seems you misunderstood me
this morning.

26:07.355 --> 26:08.866
No. What?

26:08.890 --> 26:11.693
Our payment plan was made in good faith,

26:11.718 --> 26:13.729
based on mutual respect.

26:13.753 --> 26:15.831
But my buddy here told me
that you placed a bet

26:15.855 --> 26:17.833
on this game at the Bellagio.

26:17.857 --> 26:19.335
Now, that's just disrespectful.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.185
No, no, no. No disrespect intended, Nemo.

26:22.209 --> 26:24.521
I mean, don't worry. I got you covered.

26:24.545 --> 26:28.291
When this game goes my way,
I'll pay you back in full.

26:28.315 --> 26:30.260
No more installments, no more delays.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.828
I win, we all win.

26:31.852 --> 26:33.930
Boom!

26:37.491 --> 26:39.636
Right.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.237
Why don't you kick back, homey?

26:41.261 --> 26:42.839
Let's watch it together.

26:42.863 --> 26:44.407
Sure.

26:44.431 --> 26:46.018
You better hope they win.

26:46.043 --> 26:47.521
50 down the right sideline.

26:47.545 --> 26:48.922
At the 40, at the 30...

27:01.092 --> 27:03.570
Gabe? What are you doing?

27:03.879 --> 27:05.405
I need to talk to Maya Travis.

27:05.897 --> 27:07.742
Anything you have to say
can wait till the morning.

27:07.766 --> 27:09.677
No, it can't. Ezra Wolf is saying

27:09.701 --> 27:11.813
that the LAPD planted a bloody jacket.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.948
And if they can prove that,
all the rest of the evidence

27:13.972 --> 27:16.083
that the cops collected
is gonna get thrown out.

27:16.107 --> 27:17.118
Sevvy's gonna go free.

27:17.142 --> 27:19.620
That won't happen. How do you know that?

27:20.245 --> 27:23.124
Everything's going wrong.
I... need to tell Maya.

27:23.148 --> 27:24.692
And tell her what?

27:24.716 --> 27:26.193
That I planted the jacket.

27:27.619 --> 27:28.737
Did you?

27:29.221 --> 27:30.865
No, but what does that matter?

27:30.889 --> 27:32.000
I'll say I took it out of the trash

27:32.024 --> 27:33.535
after one of Sevvy and Jessica's fights,

27:33.559 --> 27:35.303
I held onto it,
and after the bail hearing,

27:35.327 --> 27:37.672
I threw it on the side of the road.

27:37.696 --> 27:39.441
Gabe, you're upset.

27:39.465 --> 27:40.708
I get that, but you can't just...

27:40.732 --> 27:42.501
- I got to go.
- Wait.

27:43.602 --> 27:45.003
Gabe.

27:45.571 --> 27:48.249
I understand the pain you're feeling.

27:48.273 --> 27:50.485
I understand the desperation.

27:50.509 --> 27:52.554
I feel it, too.

27:52.578 --> 27:55.112
But you cannot do this.

27:57.216 --> 27:59.794
You cannot lie.

27:59.818 --> 28:01.629
Not about this.

28:01.653 --> 28:03.438
I have to do something.

28:04.389 --> 28:06.134
You just have to stay with me.

28:06.158 --> 28:07.846
That's all. Just stay...

28:21.077 --> 28:22.988
Hey. I just wanted you to know

28:23.012 --> 28:24.290
I'm working on getting you security.

28:24.314 --> 28:27.829
You know, it took everything I had

28:27.854 --> 28:30.299
to get on the plane
to come back down here,

28:30.323 --> 28:32.190
dive back into this nightmare.

28:33.894 --> 28:35.504
The only thing that made it bearable

28:35.528 --> 28:37.473
was knowing you'd be by my side,

28:37.497 --> 28:39.709
on my side.

28:40.213 --> 28:41.476
I am on your side.

28:43.545 --> 28:44.789
You're a liar.

28:44.813 --> 28:47.058
Maya, what are you talking about?

28:47.082 --> 28:48.726
Loni told me everything...

28:48.750 --> 28:50.261
how you found out she was the mole,

28:50.285 --> 28:52.779
how you chose not to share that with me.

28:54.047 --> 28:56.859
I was trying to protect you
and protect the case.

28:56.883 --> 28:59.095
Don't make this worse by patronizing me.

28:59.119 --> 29:00.763
What would you have done
if I'd have told you?

29:00.787 --> 29:02.865
You'd have raised holy hell
to get her fired.

29:02.889 --> 29:04.533
And you think that wouldn't have leaked?

29:04.975 --> 29:07.788
I kept it quiet, and I'd do
the same thing again.

29:07.812 --> 29:11.691
Every day, I have been working
with somebody who betrayed me.

29:11.715 --> 29:12.726
Loni regrets what she...

29:12.750 --> 29:14.795
Not Loni. You.

29:15.302 --> 29:16.418
I trusted you.

29:19.114 --> 29:20.458
Clearly, I shouldn't have.

29:20.482 --> 29:21.793
- Maya.
- Don't.

29:21.817 --> 29:23.828
I would have told you
when the time was right.

29:23.852 --> 29:25.770
I swear to you.

29:26.621 --> 29:29.600
I don't believe a word you say.

29:29.624 --> 29:31.502
Not anymore.

29:39.175 --> 29:40.819
Hey, Vince.

29:40.843 --> 29:42.370
What are you doing here, James?

29:44.139 --> 29:46.659
Sorry about this, but there's
somebody who needs to talk to you.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.586
You brought her to my house?!

29:48.610 --> 29:50.420
I am trying to help you.

29:51.046 --> 29:52.390
I know I'm not your favorite
person right now...

29:52.414 --> 29:54.592
- You're damn right.
- No, just give me five minutes,

29:54.616 --> 29:56.843
and maybe we can end this here.

29:57.686 --> 29:59.463
I'm not the enemy.

30:34.990 --> 30:36.055
Hey.

30:37.392 --> 30:38.925
Matthew lied to me.

30:42.530 --> 30:45.643
Well, I have a hard time
believing that that's true.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.378
Loni's the mole.

30:47.402 --> 30:49.614
Not the janitor. Loni.

30:49.638 --> 30:51.104
And Matthew covered it up.

30:52.791 --> 30:55.704
- Wow.
- I feel like such an idiot.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.267
Don't. I-I believed it.

30:58.338 --> 30:59.482
We all did.

30:59.506 --> 31:01.651
Apparently Wiest figured it out.

31:03.443 --> 31:05.555
Why did I come here?

31:05.579 --> 31:07.090
My life was good,

31:07.114 --> 31:10.460
and now everything is falling apart.

31:10.484 --> 31:12.562
I can't trust anybody.

31:12.852 --> 31:14.029
Well, would it help if I told you

31:14.053 --> 31:15.964
that North didn't plant the jacket?

31:15.988 --> 31:17.332
It might.

31:17.356 --> 31:18.901
Are you sure?

31:18.925 --> 31:21.170
The coroner started the autopsy early,

31:21.194 --> 31:23.172
finished before North even got there,

31:23.196 --> 31:24.740
and signed North's name to the report

31:24.764 --> 31:26.724
without thinking anyone
would know the difference.

31:27.158 --> 31:29.937
So North never even had
access to Jessica's blood.

31:29.961 --> 31:32.439
I accused a good cop of being a bad cop,

31:32.463 --> 31:35.242
and I pissed off the LAPD for no reason.

31:35.266 --> 31:37.811
So, not making things better.

31:37.835 --> 31:40.948
Thanks for trying.

31:41.456 --> 31:44.401
I still think that jacket
was planted, CJ.

31:44.426 --> 31:46.371
When it showed up, where it showed up,

31:46.395 --> 31:47.526
the pattern of the blood...

31:47.550 --> 31:50.509
something about it just is not right.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.208
Where does that leave us?

31:52.902 --> 31:54.279
With a question...

31:54.303 --> 31:57.137
if North didn't plant
the jacket, who did?

31:58.073 --> 32:00.352
- If I can't answer that...
- No. Don't go there.

32:00.822 --> 32:01.999
We will find the answer.

32:02.023 --> 32:03.400
We're not gonna let this case fall apart.

32:03.424 --> 32:05.055
We got this.

32:06.060 --> 32:07.838
I bet you're a great mom.

32:07.862 --> 32:09.974
Honey, I am the best.

32:11.661 --> 32:12.838
Being a wife...

32:12.862 --> 32:14.940
well, that's a whole nother story.

32:15.248 --> 32:17.026
And for the record,

32:17.484 --> 32:20.229
you can always trust me.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.487
Thank you.

32:33.057 --> 32:34.368
Nap time's over.

32:34.392 --> 32:35.969
I got 50 tips that need following up.

32:35.993 --> 32:39.273
I find everything is always
so much clearer after Savasana.

32:39.297 --> 32:41.842
What's clear is your ass
should be out there.

32:41.866 --> 32:43.544
Here's the thing.

32:43.568 --> 32:45.546
I like to win...

32:45.570 --> 32:49.049
and this case isn't a winner.

32:49.073 --> 32:50.951
And it could have been.

32:50.975 --> 32:54.021
When I walked up the steps of
that plane in Atlanta,

32:54.045 --> 32:55.647
it was.

32:56.731 --> 32:58.392
There's just one problem.

32:58.416 --> 33:01.061
- Yeah? What's that?
- And it can't be overcome...

33:01.085 --> 33:02.830
you.

33:02.854 --> 33:04.665
- Me?
- Yeah.

33:05.337 --> 33:08.026
In retrospect, winning that bail hearing

33:08.051 --> 33:10.930
was the worst thing I could have done.

33:10.954 --> 33:12.798
If you'd been in jail,
you wouldn't have been able

33:12.822 --> 33:14.500
to screw things up so badly.

33:14.524 --> 33:15.534
You know what?

33:15.558 --> 33:17.636
I've already got one controlling lawyer.

33:17.660 --> 33:18.838
I don't need two.

33:18.862 --> 33:20.506
No, you don't.

33:20.530 --> 33:21.829
That's why I'm leaving.

33:27.095 --> 33:28.680
Just remember,

33:29.172 --> 33:32.251
when you're sitting in prison
for the rest of your life,

33:32.275 --> 33:35.187
I could have won this for you.

33:35.211 --> 33:36.822
But your narcissism,

33:36.846 --> 33:39.124
- your ego...
- My love.

33:39.816 --> 33:41.193
I loved her.

33:41.818 --> 33:43.629
And I'll find who the real killer is,

33:44.087 --> 33:45.598
and I'll prove I'm innocent.

33:45.622 --> 33:48.556
Take it from somebody who works
with death row inmates.

33:50.226 --> 33:54.473
Innocent people go to jail all the time.

34:01.896 --> 34:03.040
Where the hell's Ezra?

34:03.064 --> 34:04.375
I don't know.

34:04.399 --> 34:06.610
I'm worried about him.
He always answers when I call.

34:07.010 --> 34:08.601
Always.

34:13.658 --> 34:15.302
There you go!

34:15.326 --> 34:17.737
Stop, stop! Look, I'll give you
whatever you want.

34:17.762 --> 34:19.895
Just no more, no more!

34:21.866 --> 34:23.255
All right. Get him out.

34:23.279 --> 34:24.569
Get him out.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.166
Relax, bro.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.235
I'm not gonna kill you.

34:36.259 --> 34:38.152
Dead men can't pay.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.505
I'll get you whatever you want.

34:39.529 --> 34:41.574
I-I-I promise you.

34:41.598 --> 34:42.868
I'll get whatever you want.

34:42.891 --> 34:44.476
Wait! No! No, no!

34:44.501 --> 34:47.480
What are you guys doing?! No! No! No! No!

34:47.504 --> 34:49.014
No, please! Please!

34:49.039 --> 34:50.049
Nemo, no, no, no!

34:50.072 --> 34:51.417
No, come on. What are you doing?

34:51.440 --> 34:52.717
What are you doing? No, no, no.

34:52.742 --> 34:53.953
- Nemo, come on. No, please!
- Come on, Wolf.

34:53.976 --> 34:55.621
You know I can't go back
to the boss empty-handed.

34:55.645 --> 34:57.223
Please, I'll get my assistant.

34:57.247 --> 34:58.691
She'll wire you whatever you need.

34:58.715 --> 35:00.092
No, no, no. No, please.

35:00.116 --> 35:02.128
- Yeah.
- No, don't... Come on, Nemo.

35:02.152 --> 35:03.629
- Please.
- No more talking.

35:03.653 --> 35:05.631
- No, come on. No, no!
- Hold him down!

35:05.655 --> 35:07.433
Hold him!

35:10.581 --> 35:13.461
I'll give you anything
you want. Anything you want.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.616
You know what we want.
You just didn't want to give it.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.863
- No, no, no. Please, stop, stop. Stop.
- Now you have a few reasons

35:17.887 --> 35:19.198
not to make the same mistake.

35:19.222 --> 35:20.132
Hold him.

35:20.156 --> 35:21.267
No, no!

35:21.291 --> 35:22.611
What the hell's going on up here?

35:24.594 --> 35:27.340
- Get off of him!
- Your friend has a debt to pay.

35:27.364 --> 35:29.075
Whatever he owes you,
I'll cover it, okay?!

35:29.099 --> 35:30.443
Don't make promises you can't keep.

35:30.467 --> 35:32.311
I don't. You'll get your money.

35:32.335 --> 35:34.513
Just don't ever show your face
around here again.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.684
Get the hell out of here.

35:38.174 --> 35:40.486
Hey, let's go.

35:44.214 --> 35:46.092
Sevvy.

35:46.116 --> 35:48.527
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

35:50.587 --> 35:52.720
It's all right. Listen. Listen, Wolf.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.148
Wiest won't let us take

35:57.172 --> 35:59.984
a high-profile case to trial
unless it's ironclad,

36:00.008 --> 36:02.453
and we can't count on
Matthew to back us up.

36:02.477 --> 36:04.856
At least we know what we're up against.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.791
Julianne?

36:06.815 --> 36:08.993
Maya, I was hoping we could talk.

36:09.017 --> 36:11.843
I'll wait for you.
I'll walk you down later.

36:12.187 --> 36:14.298
Why don't you come with me?

36:14.322 --> 36:16.343
I'd like to pose a hypothetical.

36:16.368 --> 36:18.549
- Okay.
- If a person came forward

36:18.574 --> 36:21.486
and said they put the jacket by the road

36:21.510 --> 36:22.821
near the homeless encampment,

36:22.845 --> 36:24.255
what would happen to that person?

36:24.279 --> 36:26.191
- Depends.
- On what?

36:26.215 --> 36:28.460
Why they did it, for one.

36:28.484 --> 36:31.296
Say they did it because,
after the bail hearing,

36:31.858 --> 36:33.636
they saw your case falling apart.

36:33.661 --> 36:35.761
So they were just trying to help?

36:36.725 --> 36:39.404
They didn't want Sevvy to go free,

36:39.428 --> 36:41.161
not after everything he's done.

36:41.185 --> 36:43.700
I would need to know how
this hypothetical person

36:43.725 --> 36:46.259
came to get a jacket with
Jessica's blood on it.

36:47.295 --> 36:48.539
Tell me what would happen,

36:48.563 --> 36:50.341
and I might be able to answer that.

36:50.365 --> 36:51.775
I could make a deal

36:51.799 --> 36:54.636
in exchange for testimony under oath.

36:55.870 --> 36:58.148
No jail. Probation.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.783
Community service, as much as you want.

36:59.807 --> 37:01.652
That's my condition.

37:01.676 --> 37:02.887
Okay.

37:03.327 --> 37:05.505
Jessica brought the jacket to me

37:05.529 --> 37:08.174
a few weeks before she died.

37:08.198 --> 37:10.143
She said she wanted me to have...

37:10.167 --> 37:11.878
evidence that he was beating her,

37:11.902 --> 37:14.013
in case something happened.

37:14.297 --> 37:15.608
A few weeks? Are you sure?

37:15.632 --> 37:18.678
He said the beatings
stopped way before that.

37:18.702 --> 37:20.446
And you believed him?

37:20.878 --> 37:23.156
Look who fell for the movie-star charm.

37:23.181 --> 37:26.427
Why didn't you turn the jacket
in when Jessica was found dead?

37:26.451 --> 37:28.763
He's the father of my children.

37:28.787 --> 37:30.231
Jessica was dead.

37:30.255 --> 37:32.333
I couldn't help her anymore.

37:32.357 --> 37:34.936
So this has nothing to do
with him letting Wolf

37:34.960 --> 37:38.106
try and pin the murder on you?

37:38.446 --> 37:40.490
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

37:40.514 --> 37:43.927
You'll say all of this
on the witness stand?

37:43.951 --> 37:46.263
I will put my hand on the Bible

37:46.287 --> 37:49.800
and swear before God to every word.

38:00.253 --> 38:03.120
Here. Have this. It'll help.

38:06.332 --> 38:09.619
Look, Carys is on the way
as a favor to me.

38:10.394 --> 38:12.962
She wanted you to be clear on that.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.245
Hey.

38:18.269 --> 38:20.948
Come on, man. It's only one toe.

38:20.972 --> 38:22.583
You'll be fine.

38:28.955 --> 38:30.432
He was my friend.

38:36.237 --> 38:38.007
Buck...

38:38.681 --> 38:39.892
was my only friend.

38:48.244 --> 38:50.378
You're a son of a bitch, Wolf.

38:52.478 --> 38:55.124
But you're a survivor.

38:55.621 --> 38:56.987
We both are.

39:00.246 --> 39:01.578
You and I...

39:03.197 --> 39:05.609
one way or another,

39:05.633 --> 39:07.477
we're gonna get through this.

39:35.897 --> 39:37.274
Have you seen CJ?

39:37.773 --> 39:38.850
Um...

39:38.874 --> 39:40.685
I think she left a few minutes ago.

39:41.277 --> 39:42.721
If you want, I'd be happy
to walk you down.

39:42.745 --> 39:43.822
All right.

39:43.846 --> 39:46.258
I heard about what happened this morning.

39:46.282 --> 39:48.893
Yeah, everyone in the office
is real worried about you.

39:50.153 --> 39:51.397
Are you sure you don't mind?

39:51.421 --> 39:52.798
Yeah, no problem at all.

39:52.822 --> 39:53.966
Thanks, Leo.

40:12.350 --> 40:13.694
How long have you been here?

40:13.718 --> 40:15.229
A couple hours.

40:15.253 --> 40:16.464
I was in meetings in City Hall.

40:16.488 --> 40:17.720
You could have called.

40:20.225 --> 40:21.824
Loni?

40:24.930 --> 40:26.807
I quit.

40:26.831 --> 40:29.944
- Don't be rash.
- You are done telling me how to be.

40:30.284 --> 40:32.929
You, Matthew, Wolf...

40:32.953 --> 40:34.130
all of you.

40:34.154 --> 40:36.233
You treat me like a pawn.

40:36.257 --> 40:39.402
"Do this, Loni. Do that."

40:39.627 --> 40:40.938
Screw you all.

40:46.568 --> 40:48.077
And, by the way...

40:49.036 --> 40:50.714
Maya knows everything.

40:57.376 --> 40:59.830
It's a bug. I thought it was Wolf's,

40:59.855 --> 41:01.466
and I didn't know about the stalker.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.134
- If I had...
- You still would have lied,

41:03.158 --> 41:04.602
just not enough to get her killed?

41:04.626 --> 41:07.138
- I deserve that.
- Yeah.

41:07.162 --> 41:08.539
Where'd you find this?

41:08.563 --> 41:10.108
In the War Room.

41:10.132 --> 41:12.577
When Riv told me about the bug
at Maya's house,

41:12.601 --> 41:14.312
I got it back from I.T.
I thought you'd want to see it.

41:14.336 --> 41:16.022
It's the same kind.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.283
If this was in the War Room,

41:19.307 --> 41:22.186
then that means the stalker
has security clearance.

41:22.210 --> 41:25.323
It's someone in the building.
I got to find Maya.

41:29.493 --> 41:31.429
Thanks again for doing this, Leo.

41:31.679 --> 41:33.023
I can't let anything happen to you.

41:33.047 --> 41:35.225
You've got an important job to do.

41:37.785 --> 41:39.863
After what happened,
you're not staying at home?

41:39.887 --> 41:41.264
No. No, we're in a hotel.

41:41.288 --> 41:44.201
- Okay, good. That's good.
- Yeah.

41:44.225 --> 41:47.037
Well, you have a great night,
and thank you.

41:47.486 --> 41:48.830
Which hotel is it?

41:48.854 --> 41:50.098
If you want, I could follow you,

41:50.122 --> 41:51.974
you know, for safety.

41:52.458 --> 41:53.935
That's okay.

41:54.793 --> 41:56.171
Riv's waiting for me.

41:56.195 --> 41:59.830
Least your case just got
a whole lot easier now, right?

42:00.966 --> 42:02.610
With Wolf's guy out of the way?

42:02.634 --> 42:04.528
Yeah, maybe.

42:04.970 --> 42:06.247
Look, I better get going.

42:06.271 --> 42:07.904
Thanks again.

42:10.242 --> 42:12.754
I'll see you tomorrow, Leo.

42:14.313 --> 42:15.857
I think I said too much.
