It seems like Hamilton
was concerned about that too.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.316
Why do you say that?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.851
Okay,
according to these texts,

11:57.918 --> 11:59.787
Hamilton was worried
that the buyer

11:59.853 --> 12:02.222
was going to use
the sarin here in America.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.824
So he said he first wanted
to meet up

12:03.891 --> 12:05.225
with the buyer face-to-face

12:05.292 --> 12:08.561
to discuss his plans
for the item being sold.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.431
The only reason why
they would kill Hamilton

12:11.498 --> 12:12.732
is if they were lying to him

12:12.800 --> 12:14.267
and they intend
to use it here in the U.S.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.870
This face-to-face meeting,
where did it take place?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.239
1455 Overbrook Avenue, Brooklyn.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.141
I'm on it.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.477
According to Ian,
they met four days ago

12:24.544 --> 12:25.913
at 4:00 p.m. in Brooklyn.
- Mm.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.415
Little more. Little more.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.416
Yep.
- Got it.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.284
Okay.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.187
Okay, that's good enough
for facial rec, yeah?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.456
Yep. We got a hit.
Hakeen Abbas.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.958
All right. Eyes up.

12:38.025 --> 12:41.494
Age 51, Syrian national,
here on a work visa.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.263
Looks like he's a scientist.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.599
Been employed at three biotech
firms over the past 12 years.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.136
Last one was called
Gen Research.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.670
But he doesn't work
for them now?

12:50.737 --> 12:51.972
No, it doesn't look like it.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.406
Do you have a current address
on file?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.708
No, but he's got a sister
who lives in Astoria.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.744
Go.
We'll send you the address.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.049

13:02.115 --> 13:03.583
I don't know where he is.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.585
He came by my house last night,
asked to borrow my car.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.687
- What kind of car?
- A Lexus.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.957
- Is it a dark blue one?
- Yes.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.192
- Does it have a GPS?
- It doesn't.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.861
Can someone please tell me
what the hell going on?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.695
We think that your brother
is in possession

13:15.762 --> 13:17.697
of a dangerous
and illegal weapon.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.233
It's a serious crime.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.104
You're not surprised to hear me
say that, are you?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.908
My brother's not well.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.442
Not well? What do you mean?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.211
He's in a different world.

13:31.278 --> 13:35.782
All he talks about
is the government and politics.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.585
That's why I kicked him out
a few weeks ago.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.054
He's been getting scary.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.091
Okay.
What prompted all of this?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.526
He lost both his sons,
my nephews three years ago

13:46.593 --> 13:48.461
in a missile attack in Syria.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.064
He never recovered.

13:51.131 --> 13:55.168
The whole thing is so sad.
Hakeem is such a brilliant man.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.836

the United States

13:56.904 --> 13:59.172
dropped those bombs
in Damascus...

13:59.239 --> 14:02.575
he's been checked out,
like something inside broke.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.444
Okay, ma'am, we really need
to find your brother.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.745

I don't know where he is.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.180

14:07.247 --> 14:08.882
No, at least none
that I know of.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.217

14:12.119 --> 14:13.753
Ma'am, your brother
and another man

14:13.820 --> 14:15.022
killed someone this morning.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.356
Shot them three times
in the chest,

14:16.423 --> 14:17.590

14:37.810 --> 14:41.514
He moved into a house
in Flushing with another man.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.683
- What's the man's name?
- His first name is Nassar.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.187
Says he lost family members
in the attack as well.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.123
They met online

Negative.
If you use the syringe

before the onset of symptoms,
it will be ineffective.
