It-- It's football.

01:45.795 --> 01:47.176

- Yeah.

No.

I mean, yeah,
there's-- there's pressure.

number-one draft pick,

02:07.748 --> 02:08.921

and his entire NFL future
is in my hands.

02:12.822 --> 02:15.514
Yeah. The most capable hands
in the whole state.

02:15.652 --> 02:17.689
You're the one and only
ortho surgeon

02:17.827 --> 02:19.760
to the Seattle Mariners!

02:20.761 --> 02:23.108
- That's the baseball team.
- There it is!

02:23.246 --> 02:25.352
And, you know, I wish
Nico wasn't traveling
with them right now,

02:25.490 --> 02:27.733
because I could really
use him as an assist.

02:27.871 --> 02:29.356
You don't need him.

02:29.494 --> 02:31.910
Think of all the people
who can walk and play sports

02:32.048 --> 02:35.465
and enjoy their life
because of your hands.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.881
That last part sounded dirty,
and I recognize it.

02:38.019 --> 02:40.884
But you are
a uniquely gifted surgeon.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.577
Oh, this is disgusting.

02:43.715 --> 02:44.785
Your words.

02:44.923 --> 02:46.752
Thank you!

02:49.065 --> 02:50.480
Thank you.

02:50.618 --> 02:51.895
Oh, hey, Altman.
Altman, hold up.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.621
Um, is everything okay?

02:53.759 --> 02:56.383
I mean, I haven't heard from you
since I submitted your offer

02:56.521 --> 02:58.661
for chief of surgery,
which expires...

02:58.799 --> 03:00.766
at 6:00 p.m. today.

03:00.904 --> 03:02.492
Well, I still have
a few hours, then.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.770
Look, since Marsh left
for a few days,

03:04.908 --> 03:06.427
I'm filling in
as chief of surgery

03:06.565 --> 03:09.741
<i>and</i> residency director,
on top of chief of chiefs,

03:09.879 --> 03:13.400
which at my age
is about two chiefs too many.

03:13.538 --> 03:15.505
I took a look
at the offer.

03:15.643 --> 03:16.989
And?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.959
Owen has never had a kind word
to say about being chief,

03:21.097 --> 03:22.754
Bailey quit,
Meredith left,

03:22.892 --> 03:24.549
and you didn't exactly
sell the idea

03:24.687 --> 03:26.067
when I first
inquired about it.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.000
I just-- I-I don't know
if I want it anymore.

03:28.138 --> 03:29.554
It's a good offer, Altman.

03:29.692 --> 03:31.038
You need this.

03:31.176 --> 03:33.247
The hospital needs this.

03:36.733 --> 03:39.667
I've got till, uh, 6:00, right?

03:41.151 --> 03:44.154
- Oh, look at her.
- Oh, she looks so happy.

03:44.293 --> 03:45.259
Oh, audio.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.231
She just started.

03:51.369 --> 03:52.922
I am not
laughing at Zola.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.683
I am thinking about Meredith
living with a beginning cellist.

04:02.863 --> 04:03.829
Morning.

04:03.967 --> 04:05.590
- Hi.
- Morning.

04:17.671 --> 04:19.328
Whoa.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.952
I would rather listen to a
squeaky cello than that silence.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.609
How's therapy going?

04:24.747 --> 04:27.819
Oh, every therapist in Seattle
is booked solid.

04:27.957 --> 04:30.028
Our first appointment
is in three weeks.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.790
So we've instituted
a ceasefire until then.

04:33.928 --> 04:36.034
That silence
was a ceasefire?

04:36.172 --> 04:38.968
Silence is better than
every single word

04:39.106 --> 04:40.452
that comes out of
either of our mouths.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.531
Morning, Lincoln!

04:50.669 --> 04:51.567
Dr. Bailey.

04:51.705 --> 04:53.120
How's it going?

04:53.258 --> 04:54.294
Good. You?

04:54.432 --> 04:55.847
I'm great.
Yeah. Hunt?

04:55.985 --> 04:58.056
Oh, yeah,
same, yeah.

04:58.194 --> 04:59.920
You all want
to meet the Tank.

05:00.058 --> 05:01.577
Well, I may have, uh,
some free time.

05:01.715 --> 05:03.544
Yeah.
I've worked on a lot
of busted knees,

05:03.682 --> 05:04.718
and I love
the Seahawks.

05:04.856 --> 05:06.236
Not as much as me.
Wh--

05:06.375 --> 05:07.824
You want to say something?
Say it.

05:07.962 --> 05:09.309
Dr. Lincoln.

05:09.447 --> 05:10.827
Do you need an assist?

05:10.965 --> 05:13.174
Oh, you're
a Seahawks fan, too?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.935
Oh, well, the Tank and I
went to the same high school.

05:15.073 --> 05:17.006
Listen,
I-I appreciate the offers,

05:17.144 --> 05:19.008
but the Tank doesn't need
a room full of doctors

05:19.146 --> 05:22.114
making his procedure seem like
a bigger deal than it is.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.741
Now, were you surprised at all
by the draft pick?

05:27.879 --> 05:29.121
Nah. Nah, not really.

05:29.259 --> 05:30.226
Good morning.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.986
Dr. Lincoln.
Man of the hour.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.886
I think that's you,
the Tank.

05:35.024 --> 05:37.820
Man of the year,
according to our Sunday feature.

05:37.958 --> 05:39.304
Ken Bendix,
<i>Seattle Times.</i>

05:39.442 --> 05:41.030
Oh, yeah.
I heard you were coming.

05:42.687 --> 05:44.136
And how are
you feeling, hmm?

05:44.274 --> 05:46.000
- Any jitters?
- Come on, now.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.348
The only jitters I get
is waiting for the
football to be snapped.

05:48.486 --> 05:51.109
Then folks better watch out,
because I'm coming.

05:51.247 --> 05:53.180
- Preach now.
- Yeah, we're all
rooting for you.

05:53.318 --> 05:55.838
Half the hospital lobbied me
to be on your case.

05:55.976 --> 05:56.908
The other half is...

05:57.046 --> 05:58.254
in this room.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.325
Yasuda,
you want to present?

06:00.463 --> 06:02.189
Jermaine Talbott, 22.

06:02.327 --> 06:04.847
Tear to the left ACL
due to football injury.

06:04.985 --> 06:05.882
History of
multiple injuries,

06:06.020 --> 06:07.228
including MCL repair

06:07.367 --> 06:08.713
and meniscal
cadaver transplant.

06:08.851 --> 06:10.404
Today, he will receive

06:10.542 --> 06:13.718
a bridge-enhanced anterior
cruciate ligament repair,

06:13.856 --> 06:15.754
also known as the BEAR.

06:15.892 --> 06:17.411
And why is this
his best option?

06:17.549 --> 06:19.344
It uses a collagen graft
soaked in the patient's blood,

06:19.482 --> 06:20.690
instead of
donor tissue,

06:20.828 --> 06:21.726
which allows the body
to heal itself

06:21.864 --> 06:22.865
and yields better results

06:23.003 --> 06:24.038
than traditional
ACL repairs.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.868
Excellent.
You're scrubbing in.

06:26.006 --> 06:30.700
Okay, yeah, but how else is
the BEAR important to my career?

06:30.838 --> 06:32.702
- It's less invasive.
- Because it heals faster.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.049
True, but not the answer
he's looking for.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.224
It will allow him to ambulate
and return to play sooner.

06:37.362 --> 06:40.710
- Also yes, but no.
- Come on, guys.
I know someone's got this.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.747
The Belser Bears.
Played as a true freshman.

06:42.885 --> 06:45.301
Led the team in sacks
and tackles all four years.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.579
Congratulations, Kwan.
You're scrubbing in, too.

06:47.717 --> 06:49.719
The three of you
will report to Dr. Schmitt,

06:49.857 --> 06:52.826
who I believe is, conveniently,
right outside.

06:57.244 --> 06:58.625
It's every person
for themselves now.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.385
I am <i>not</i> losing
another surgery.

07:00.523 --> 07:01.800
We don't have to compete
over everything.

07:01.938 --> 07:03.319
First person to do
an actual procedure

07:03.457 --> 07:04.769
gets the bedroom
to the left of the stairs.

07:04.907 --> 07:05.908
What?
I already drew that room.

07:06.046 --> 07:07.599
- And I'm appealing the draw.
- What?

07:09.946 --> 07:11.845
Help! Please!

07:11.983 --> 07:13.467
- I'm on it!
- Mine! Paws off!

07:13.605 --> 07:16.090
Hi, I'm Dr. Adams.
Can you tell us what happened?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.644
I failed, doc.
I couldn't do it.

07:17.782 --> 07:19.093
You couldn't do what?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.302
- The Pho-Nomenal Challenge.
- What is that?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.304
The Pho-Nomenal Challenge
is three pounds of meat,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.341
three pounds of noodles,
three liters of broth.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.619
If you finish in an hour
and a half, you win $250.

07:27.757 --> 07:28.862
Did you just come
from there?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.967
No, I tried it five days ago,

07:31.105 --> 07:33.798
and I have not been able
to take a crap since.

07:33.936 --> 07:34.971
Please help me.

07:37.629 --> 07:39.769
Oh, God.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.442
What do you got?

07:57.580 --> 07:59.686
A 23-year-old male,
5 days without a bowel movement

07:59.824 --> 08:01.170
after participating
in an eating contest.

08:01.308 --> 08:02.240
Eating challenge.

08:02.378 --> 08:03.759
Severe abdominal pain,

08:03.897 --> 08:05.277
bloating,
difficulty sitting.

08:05.415 --> 08:07.210
Hey, I'm Dr. Schmitt.

08:07.348 --> 08:09.765
Have you tried increasing
your water intake,

08:09.903 --> 08:11.318
eating adequate
sources of fiber?

08:11.456 --> 08:13.389
Exercise helps,
reducing stress.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.770
How am I supposed
to reduce stress

08:14.908 --> 08:17.531
when my entire body
is full of pho?

08:17.669 --> 08:18.946
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:19.084 --> 08:21.259
I'm just--
I'm very uncomfortable.

08:21.397 --> 08:22.950
Excuse me. Um...

08:23.088 --> 08:23.951
Can I borrow one of you?

08:24.089 --> 08:24.952
Me!
Is it surgical?

08:25.090 --> 08:26.091
Go, Millin.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.957
Get a KUB and then
do a digital rectal exam.

08:30.095 --> 08:31.303
Wait, I'm sorry.
Digital?

08:31.441 --> 08:32.546
Yeah, a finger.
It helps us--

08:32.684 --> 08:34.652
Okay, d-- Never mind.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.136
After ruling everything out,

08:36.274 --> 08:38.000
you can try a stool softener
or an enema.

08:38.138 --> 08:40.968
If none of that works, then we
can consider doing a procedure.

08:42.936 --> 08:44.800
Ow! God!

08:44.938 --> 08:46.733
Still want that room?

08:47.596 --> 08:49.943
Oh! God!

08:52.117 --> 08:54.741
Lupe. Lupe, I'm on the phone,
amor, okay?

08:54.879 --> 08:56.639
Okay.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.054
Uh, Sierra Deleon?

08:58.192 --> 08:59.297
She can cover?

08:59.435 --> 09:01.920
Great. Thank you.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.370
Okay, sorry.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.234
I needed to make sure
my shift was covered.

09:05.372 --> 09:08.513
Um, I'm pregnant with my third,
and I'm spotting.

09:08.651 --> 09:10.066
Uh, here, sweetie.
Come here.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.621
Yeah. It's a plane.
You can play here.

09:12.759 --> 09:13.863
Okay, so how long
have you been spotting?

09:14.001 --> 09:15.209
A few days.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.486
At first, I didn't think
too much of it,

09:16.625 --> 09:18.385
but now I'm starting
to get a bit stressed.

09:18.523 --> 09:19.559
Oh!
Lupe.

09:19.697 --> 09:21.008
Okay.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.354
Sorry about that.

09:22.492 --> 09:23.666
Here, go sit down.
Go sit down.

09:23.804 --> 09:25.081
Go sit.

09:25.219 --> 09:27.083
Have you experienced
any clotting or noticed

09:27.221 --> 09:28.740
an increase
in the amount of blood?

09:28.878 --> 09:30.362
Maybe.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.743
I'm not really sure.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.711
Lupe's dad drives
cross-country rigs,

09:33.849 --> 09:35.782
which means I'm lucky
if I get out the front door

09:35.920 --> 09:37.024
with deodorant on.

09:37.162 --> 09:38.232
Alright,
I'm going to page OB.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.786
We're gonna get you
an ultrasound

09:39.924 --> 09:41.339
to see if we can find
the cause of the bleeding.

09:41.477 --> 09:42.858
Okay.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.998
Alright,
I'll see you in a bit.

09:45.136 --> 09:46.033
Eeh!

09:47.310 --> 09:49.002
Thanks.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.555
Oh, now, I'm texting this
to my husband.

09:50.693 --> 09:51.832
He's gonna be jealous.

09:51.970 --> 09:52.937
He's a Tank fan?

09:53.075 --> 09:55.387
Ah, saw you play
at Royer High

09:55.525 --> 09:56.665
before you were even
the Tank.

09:56.803 --> 09:58.252
He predicted you
were gonna be a star.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.013
Oh, okay.
So I guess he's
gonna be jealous

10:00.151 --> 10:01.635
- and smug.
- Mm.

10:01.773 --> 10:04.465
I was on a nighttime ER rotation
in the Caribbean

10:04.604 --> 10:07.607
when you had that pick six
to win the Rose Bowl.

10:07.745 --> 10:09.401
First time
I tore my meniscus.

10:09.539 --> 10:12.542
But we won the championship,
so... worth it.

10:12.681 --> 10:13.958
Storm took out
the hospital Wi-Fi,

10:14.096 --> 10:15.718
and I had
the only hot spot.

10:15.856 --> 10:18.134
Everyone--
patients, doctors--

10:18.272 --> 10:20.033
they all had opinions
on how to treat you.

10:20.171 --> 10:21.586
- Oh.
- One of their own.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.519
And now
you're my patient.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.452
Mm, that's
an interesting angle.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.729
Do you have
a few minutes?

10:26.867 --> 10:27.937
Could I ask you
some questions?

10:28.075 --> 10:29.318
Uh...

10:29.456 --> 10:30.353
Bring it on.

10:30.491 --> 10:31.389
How about
we step outside?

10:31.527 --> 10:32.977
Eh... hold on.

10:33.115 --> 10:34.116
Oh, daycare.

10:34.254 --> 10:35.427
Oh.

10:35.565 --> 10:36.981
I'd better see
what that is.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.638
Um, thank you
for the photo, Tank.

10:38.776 --> 10:40.467
No problem.

10:40.605 --> 10:41.951
Bye.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.058
<i>Dr. Azzi to Oncology.</i>

10:45.196 --> 10:47.301
<i>Dr. Yasmin Azzi to Oncology.</i>

10:47.439 --> 10:48.820
This one?

10:48.958 --> 10:51.271
You know, I had a couple
ACL repairs in college.

10:51.409 --> 10:52.375
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

10:52.513 --> 10:53.998
Busted my knee
ice skating.

10:54.136 --> 10:55.965
Used to be
pretty competitive.
Used to?

10:56.103 --> 10:57.657
Your recovery didn't go well
or something?

10:57.795 --> 10:59.969
- No, no, it went great.
- But you couldn't skate?

11:00.107 --> 11:01.902
Oh, I didn't have time.
I got into med school.

11:02.040 --> 11:02.972
Then it's on and popping.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.733
Ayyy! I feel that.

11:04.871 --> 11:07.321
I know you do, now.

11:08.564 --> 11:10.221
Hey, the kids okay?
I just got paged.

11:10.359 --> 11:11.740
Yeah, me, too.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.327
They probably threw blocks
at each other again

11:13.465 --> 11:16.192
and file some sort of
injury report or something.

11:16.330 --> 11:18.643
Huh. Hey, there is another plus
about being chief.

11:18.781 --> 11:20.231
They usually bring
that paperwork to you.

11:20.369 --> 11:21.888
Okay.

11:22.026 --> 11:24.269
And you get a part-time
administrative assistant,

11:24.407 --> 11:26.444
which is essential
for such an important job.

11:26.582 --> 11:28.515
Richard told you that
if I took the job,

11:28.653 --> 11:29.999
that you'd be chief of trauma
again, didn't he?

11:30.137 --> 11:31.760
No.

11:31.898 --> 11:32.933
Oh, my God.

11:33.071 --> 11:35.108
He briefly floated it.

11:35.246 --> 11:36.488
Once again,
it's all about you.

11:36.626 --> 11:37.766
No, it's about us.

11:37.904 --> 11:40.561
Yeah, when it's convenient
for <i>you.</i>

11:45.808 --> 11:47.051
Were all the parents
paged?

11:47.189 --> 11:49.191
Just the parents
involved in the bite.

11:49.329 --> 11:50.640
Your kid bit my kid.

11:50.779 --> 11:52.263
- Which?
- Allison. Bit Pru.

11:52.401 --> 11:53.851
That seems like
a one-parent job.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.749
Let's make this one
about you.

11:59.649 --> 12:02.238
We are so sorry.

12:04.896 --> 12:08.831
Okay, Sierra,
you're about 11 weeks along.

12:08.969 --> 12:10.143
Hit the nail on the head.

12:10.281 --> 12:13.318
There is a strong
fetal heart beat,

12:13.456 --> 12:15.320
and your cervix
was closed on exam,

12:15.458 --> 12:16.839
so everything looks good.

12:16.977 --> 12:18.841
Your pregnancy
is right on track.

12:18.979 --> 12:23.639
You just need to rest
and avoid strenuous activity.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.537
Her BMP came back.
She's dehydrated.

12:25.675 --> 12:27.954
So just make sure she gets some
fluids before you discharge.

12:28.092 --> 12:29.127
Yeah, absolutely.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.371
Okay, so we'll
get you that IV,

12:31.509 --> 12:32.786
and you'll be out of here
in no time.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.339
Oh. Great.

12:34.477 --> 12:36.341
Mommy, the phone.

12:36.479 --> 12:38.205
Thank you.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.483
Hey. What?
She can't come in?

12:40.621 --> 12:42.347
But she told me she was
gonna come in at 10:00.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.142
- Excuse me.
- No. I'll-- I'll call her.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.212
I'll call her.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.455
Is everything all right?

12:46.593 --> 12:47.628
Not really.

12:49.113 --> 12:50.459
Yes.

12:50.597 --> 12:51.460
Everything's okay.

12:51.598 --> 12:52.875
Thank you.

12:53.013 --> 12:54.843
Well, I'll get you
those IV fluids,

12:54.981 --> 12:57.569
and, um,
you just sit tight. Okay.

12:57.707 --> 12:59.537
<i>Dr. Kurtz to Oncology.</i>

12:59.675 --> 13:02.505
<i>Dr. Fritz to oncology.</i>

13:02.643 --> 13:04.645
I didn't know colleges
had ice skating teams.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.026
Of course you didn't.

13:06.164 --> 13:08.166
Because we were hitting
the ice at 5:00 a.m.,

13:08.304 --> 13:10.203
and the football team was still
getting their beauty sleep.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.896
I had to stay focused
so I could go pro.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.587
But now I gotta
kick it up a notch.

13:15.725 --> 13:16.830
For the team?

13:16.968 --> 13:18.073
For my family.

13:18.211 --> 13:19.350
Playing ball
is what will let me

13:19.488 --> 13:20.523
bring them over
from Port-au-Prince.

13:20.661 --> 13:22.491
Haiti?
My real hometown.

13:22.629 --> 13:24.113
Yeah.

13:24.251 --> 13:26.736
A scout saw me play
when I was in the sixth grade.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.878
He asked my uncle, would he
let me train in Seattle?

13:30.016 --> 13:31.569
- Guess what he told the guy?
- Hm?

13:31.707 --> 13:34.089
"Why the hell not?"

13:34.227 --> 13:36.022
So I moved by myself.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.575
I was 11.

13:37.713 --> 13:39.404
I get to go home
and see my mom

13:39.542 --> 13:41.234
and my little brothers
every Christmas,

13:41.372 --> 13:43.477
but that's about it.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.411
This is my chance to finally
get everyone back together.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.275
So I gotta get back
on that field ASAP.

13:48.413 --> 13:49.898
You want to succeed
so it means something.

13:50.036 --> 13:51.071
Sit up for me.

13:51.209 --> 13:52.107
And deep breath.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.768
What if it doesn't work?

13:58.907 --> 14:03.014
What if he can't repair it
and I'm stuck bagging groceries?

14:04.153 --> 14:06.017
What if I can't
play ball again?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.124
But what if you <i>can?</i>

14:23.000 --> 14:24.035
That is a lot
of fecal matter.

14:24.173 --> 14:25.968
It's really good pho.

14:26.106 --> 14:27.556
It's a hole-in-the-wall
in the CID.

14:27.694 --> 14:28.868
You should try it.

14:29.006 --> 14:30.248
Well,
since you like it so much,

14:30.386 --> 14:31.387
why don't you go in
and give the enema?

14:31.525 --> 14:32.733
Are you offering
the bedroom?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.873
If you throw in
two weeks' groceries.

14:34.011 --> 14:35.150
No deal.
I know how much you eat.

14:35.288 --> 14:36.289
Not as much
as this guy.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.465
Oh, you know what?
Screw it. Gimme that.

14:42.743 --> 14:44.055
- Okay, bye.
- Mwah. Mwah.

14:45.539 --> 14:49.060
- Again, I am so, so sorry.
- Oh, please.

14:49.198 --> 14:50.234
I spoke to her.

14:50.372 --> 14:51.752
It was a one-time thing.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.099
Allison had
something to say,

14:53.237 --> 14:54.410
and she couldn't get
the words out.

14:54.548 --> 14:55.722
Kids bite.
It happens.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.068
Thanks.

14:57.206 --> 14:59.346
So, have you thought
more about chief?

14:59.484 --> 15:02.177
Well, it's a great title
and a pay bump,

15:02.315 --> 15:03.385
but is that
really enough to--

15:03.523 --> 15:04.524
No.
No?

15:04.662 --> 15:05.697
No,
it's not a pay bump.

15:05.835 --> 15:08.666
It's more like a nudge,
a small tap.

15:08.804 --> 15:11.358
It certainly
isn't enough to justify

15:11.496 --> 15:14.844
the relentless paperwork
and protocols and meetings

15:14.983 --> 15:16.087
and complaints.

15:16.225 --> 15:18.158
So... many... complaints.

15:18.296 --> 15:20.436
That's why Webber
doesn't have any takers.

15:21.782 --> 15:24.475
But <i>you</i> are in
a very interesting

15:24.613 --> 15:26.270
negotiating position, Altman,

15:26.408 --> 15:27.685
'cause they need you.

15:27.823 --> 15:31.792
And if I were you,
I'd ask for the moon.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.208
And the planets.

15:33.346 --> 15:35.141
And Pluto.

15:35.279 --> 15:37.281
What exactly do you think
that all looks like?

15:39.179 --> 15:41.354
Well, if it were me...

15:41.492 --> 15:43.701
A full-time
administrative assistant

15:43.839 --> 15:46.497
who will be the point person
for any staff complaints.

15:46.635 --> 15:49.707
And this person will also attend
budget meetings in my place

15:49.845 --> 15:52.020
if I am unavailable
and take notes for my review.

15:52.158 --> 15:54.643
I will need an additional
three weeks off

15:54.781 --> 15:58.785
and double the pay increase
that you're currently offering.

15:58.923 --> 16:01.477
And a-- a stipend
for research.

16:01.615 --> 16:04.342
Oh. Well, this is
a lot to consider.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.966
These are
my terms... Sir.

16:07.104 --> 16:10.693
Um, I-I'm gonna need some time
to think this over.

16:10.831 --> 16:12.419
I'm sure you understand.

16:12.557 --> 16:14.042
Of course.

16:25.329 --> 16:26.468
Hey.
Hey.

16:26.606 --> 16:28.228
I thought you were clipping
an aneurysm.

16:28.366 --> 16:29.885
Yeah, I finished.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.749
What are you working on?

16:31.887 --> 16:34.234
My case report for
my partial heart transplant.

16:34.372 --> 16:36.719
- The one on the baby?
- Arlo Fischer.

16:36.857 --> 16:39.377
Why would I write
"socks"?

16:39.515 --> 16:42.242
I have no idea.
But you know who might?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.556
I'm not breaking
the ceasefire.

16:45.694 --> 16:47.730
And I need to get this done
in less than three weeks.

16:47.868 --> 16:50.319
You're worried another cardio
surgeon might beat you to it?

16:53.219 --> 16:55.255
I need a win.

16:55.393 --> 16:58.638
I need a victory, because I feel
like I'm failing at my marriage,

16:58.776 --> 16:59.915
and I do not fail.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.675
I hate failing.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.989
Hiding from the hard parts
won't make it less hard.

17:05.127 --> 17:08.027
It'll just make it
last longer.

17:10.132 --> 17:11.444
Trust me.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.244
It's not a durag, Mommy,
it's for surgery.

17:18.382 --> 17:20.177
I wore it for the last two,
you remember?

17:20.315 --> 17:21.764
<i>You look so adorable.</i>

17:21.902 --> 17:24.836
<i>Now, let me meet everyone
in that room.</i>

17:24.974 --> 17:26.700
This is Dr. Kwan.

17:26.838 --> 17:27.908
Hi.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.013
And this is
Dr. Griffith.

17:29.151 --> 17:30.187
Very nice to meet you.

17:30.325 --> 17:31.188
<i>Where's Dr. Lincoln?</i>

17:31.326 --> 17:32.603
He's already in the OR.

17:32.741 --> 17:33.673
We're about to take
Jermaine there now.

17:33.811 --> 17:35.261
<i>Both of you look at me.</i>

17:35.399 --> 17:38.367
<i>My son has broken records
with his talent.</i>

17:38.505 --> 17:40.369
Yes, ma'am. <i>And noses.</i>

17:40.507 --> 17:41.888
Yes, ma'am.

17:42.026 --> 17:43.234
<i>You know where he got
that strength?</i>

17:43.372 --> 17:44.235
His mama.

17:44.373 --> 17:45.823
<i>Take care of my baby.</i>

17:47.583 --> 17:48.860
<i>I love you.</i>

17:48.998 --> 17:49.861
<i>Eyes forward.</i>

17:49.999 --> 17:51.035
<i>You hear me?</i>

17:51.173 --> 17:52.933
<i>Eyes forward.</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:54.901
Eyes forward.

17:55.039 --> 17:56.385
Na pale pita.

17:56.523 --> 17:59.043
<i>Na pale pita, chéri.
Je t'aime.</i>

18:04.255 --> 18:05.394
I'm ready.
Mm-hmm.

18:17.924 --> 18:20.582
Hey. I just wanted to
wish you good luck.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.239
Not that you need it.

18:22.377 --> 18:23.999
I'll take it.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.243
After everything
Jermaine's sacrificed to play,

18:26.381 --> 18:28.072
he doesn't deserve
to be riding the bench.

18:29.384 --> 18:32.283
I just gotta stay sharp.

18:32.421 --> 18:33.905
It's been a while since I've
been in the pressure cooker,

18:34.043 --> 18:35.597
you know?
Well...

18:35.735 --> 18:37.599
you've never
folded before.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.532
You're not
gonna start now.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.292
I know it.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.962
Oh. Thank you.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.826
So, uh, I have
considered your offer.

18:57.964 --> 18:59.690
- Ready to shake on it?
- You know,

18:59.828 --> 19:04.212
Grey-Sloan
is a place where--

19:04.350 --> 19:07.318
where legacies are built,
history is written.

19:07.456 --> 19:11.771
Working here, for me, I mean,
evokes a feeling of... duty.

19:11.909 --> 19:13.945
It's an honor to serve.

19:14.083 --> 19:18.881
And often,
service requires sacrifice.

19:19.019 --> 19:20.469
It's a little weird
to put it that way,

19:20.607 --> 19:22.368
especially to someone
who actually served, but--

19:22.506 --> 19:23.714
Uh, I'm-- I'm not
done yet.

19:23.852 --> 19:25.164
Oh.
Thank you.

19:25.302 --> 19:29.616
When I see these doctors,
these patients,

19:29.754 --> 19:31.135
it brings me joy.

19:31.273 --> 19:32.309
It makes me happy,

19:32.447 --> 19:35.104
um, fulfilled.

19:35.243 --> 19:36.451
Oh.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.970
And thinking about
all of this,

19:39.108 --> 19:42.111
well, Altman, I've decided
to take the job myself.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.942
I-I love being here.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.495
I even love
the building itself.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.394
And, um,
I'm-- I'm happy

19:48.532 --> 19:50.292
with the money
that's already on the table.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.777
It's not about that
for me.

19:52.915 --> 19:54.469
So, um...

19:54.607 --> 19:56.056
thank you for your time,
Dr. Altman.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.408
Fine.
We can lose the stipend.

20:04.099 --> 20:05.583
Oh. Okay.

20:05.721 --> 20:10.243
We will... lose the... stipend.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.662
Excuse me.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.011
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

20:20.149 --> 20:21.634
Hey. What'd I miss?

20:21.772 --> 20:23.498
They sutured the ACL
and are making the tunnels.

20:23.636 --> 20:25.293
They're about to prepare
the implant for placement.

20:27.122 --> 20:28.123
He wasn't asking me,
was he?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.676
Very much not.

20:29.814 --> 20:31.747
Man,
I hope this goes well.

20:31.885 --> 20:34.129
The Tank has suffered
enough setbacks.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.407
Are, uh,
things better at home?

20:36.545 --> 20:37.822
You know, all due--
all due respect,

20:37.960 --> 20:39.859
the last time we talked,
you gave me some advice

20:39.997 --> 20:42.931
that kinda blew up
in my face.

20:43.069 --> 20:44.726
Maggie's been staying
with Amelia.

20:44.864 --> 20:47.349
Wh-- Oh. Um...

20:47.487 --> 20:48.419
I'm sorry.

20:48.557 --> 20:50.041
It's-- It's my fault.

20:50.179 --> 20:54.149
I should have thought twice
before I took advice from you.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.358
What's that
supposed to mean?

20:56.496 --> 20:58.602
I mean,
how are things with Teddy?

20:58.740 --> 21:00.604
Fair point. Yeah.

21:00.742 --> 21:02.261
The tunnels are made.

21:02.399 --> 21:04.435
He's ready for the scaffold.

21:04.573 --> 21:08.197
As amazing as I am, the Tank
weighs close to 320 pounds,

21:08.336 --> 21:10.510
and he can run 40 yards
in less than 5 seconds,

21:10.648 --> 21:11.960
which means he can take down
a quarterback

21:12.098 --> 21:14.928
with roughly
1,700 pounds of force.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.205
Never mind what that's doing
to his brain.

21:16.344 --> 21:17.517
That's a whole
other conversation.

21:17.655 --> 21:20.279
But it takes a toll
on the knees.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.970
How long
can he sustain that?

21:22.902 --> 21:25.698
Oh, on average, these defensive
players get about six years.

21:25.836 --> 21:28.217
So it's only one year longer
than residency and he's done?

21:28.356 --> 21:29.874
Let's hope he's better
than average.

21:31.669 --> 21:33.153
<i>Third floor nurses' station.</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:36.225
<i>O.T. Morell to the third floor
nurses' station.</i>

21:45.959 --> 21:48.410
Is everything okay?

21:48.548 --> 21:49.653
Sorry.

21:49.791 --> 21:50.999
Lupe threw my things
on the floor

21:51.137 --> 21:53.104
and I-I haven't
picked them up yet.

21:53.242 --> 21:55.486
Well,
your IV is almost done.

21:55.624 --> 21:57.661
Are you experiencing
any pain in your abdomen?

21:59.835 --> 22:00.871
Sierra?

22:02.700 --> 22:04.392
I can't help but notice
you seem--

22:04.530 --> 22:06.152
I just have
a lot on my mind.

22:06.290 --> 22:08.050
Sorry,
I-I know you're busy.

22:08.188 --> 22:09.431
Hey, don't apologize.

22:12.572 --> 22:15.644
I know what it feels like
to be overwhelmed,

22:15.782 --> 22:18.302
and I only have myself
to take care of.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.993
If there's something
on your mind,

22:20.131 --> 22:21.788
you can talk to me about it
if you want.

22:23.721 --> 22:25.240
The condom broke.

22:26.655 --> 22:30.314
My husband and I use condoms
because I hate the way

22:30.452 --> 22:32.661
birth control pills
make me feel.

22:32.799 --> 22:33.904
And it broke.

22:34.042 --> 22:37.217
I wasn't trying
to get pregnant.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.909
Especially after
my other two.

22:39.047 --> 22:42.568
And, don't get me wrong,
I love the hell out of them.

22:42.706 --> 22:43.707
I do.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.917
But I'm scared
it's gonna come back.

22:47.055 --> 22:49.747
What's going to come back,
Sierra?

22:49.885 --> 22:52.267
After I gave birth
to my two kids,

22:52.405 --> 22:57.479
I just felt this huge wave
rushing towards me.

22:57.617 --> 22:59.654
I would look at them,

22:59.792 --> 23:01.276
and I know I love them,

23:01.414 --> 23:05.245
but I was so exhausted
and so defeated.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.419
Depressed?

23:06.557 --> 23:08.766
It was really dark.

23:08.904 --> 23:11.942
<i>I</i> was really dark.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.978
Both times.

23:14.116 --> 23:15.877
Both babies.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.121
And the doctor called it
postpartum depression,

23:19.259 --> 23:21.330
and he prescribed me
a few medications,

23:21.469 --> 23:24.679
talk therapy,
but nothing worked.

23:24.817 --> 23:27.785
And it lasted
for months and months.

23:27.923 --> 23:30.443
So when I saw that
I was spotting, I felt...

23:32.307 --> 23:34.447
...like I could breathe.

23:34.585 --> 23:39.348
Sierra, did you...
do anything

23:39.487 --> 23:42.282
to try and terminate
this pregnancy?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.802
No.
Okay.

23:44.940 --> 23:48.012
But when I thought
I was having a miscarriage,

23:48.150 --> 23:51.430
I wasn't so terrified about
having to go through that again.

23:52.983 --> 23:56.987
I wasn't so terrified that I
wouldn't be here for my babies.

24:04.684 --> 24:06.755
How much is an abortion?

24:06.893 --> 24:09.171
Our reproductive clinic
provides counseling

24:09.309 --> 24:11.553
and abortion services
on a sliding scale.

24:11.691 --> 24:13.762
Would you like me to call
someone from down there?

24:14.970 --> 24:16.385
Okay.

24:19.354 --> 24:20.907
That's the smallest incision
I've seen

24:21.045 --> 24:22.840
for a procedure
so complex.

24:22.978 --> 24:25.464
When I was training, they used
to flay open the entire joint

24:25.602 --> 24:28.018
and staple it back together
Frankenstein-style.

24:28.156 --> 24:29.260
Mm.
These days...

24:29.398 --> 24:30.261
art.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.725
Alright, okay.
Well done, everybody.

24:45.863 --> 24:47.382
Now let's bandage up
the Tank's knee

24:47.520 --> 24:49.315
and roll him back to recovery
and let him rest.

24:49.453 --> 24:50.834
No gawkers
in the hallways

24:50.972 --> 24:52.491
waiting around awkwardly
for autographs.

24:52.629 --> 24:55.908
And absolutely no selfies.

25:00.464 --> 25:01.361
What are you doing?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.501
Can't rush the rectum.

25:02.639 --> 25:04.710
Wh--
Uh, you're a surgeon.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.056
<i>We</i> are surgeons.

25:06.194 --> 25:07.367
Yeah,
and general surgery's

25:07.506 --> 25:09.369
all about poop in the pipes, Skywalker.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.682
Curtains or shades?

25:11.820 --> 25:13.201
My room gets
a lot of light.

25:13.339 --> 25:15.514
Eh, it's not your room
until you have success.

25:19.172 --> 25:20.346
Yes!

25:20.484 --> 25:22.210
Jared,
how are you feeling?

25:22.348 --> 25:24.281
I feel like
I just lost 10 pounds.

25:24.419 --> 25:25.869
Pho-tastic!

25:26.007 --> 25:27.387
It's another dish
on the menu.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.045
I want to say thank you so much
for your help.

25:30.183 --> 25:31.184
Now I can go back.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.703
Uh, um, I'm sorry?

25:32.841 --> 25:34.878
To the restaurant.
I need to win that $250.

25:35.016 --> 25:36.569
Uh, sir, I really think

25:36.707 --> 25:38.226
you should let
your digestive system--Am I free to go?

25:38.364 --> 25:39.986
Yeah,
you are free to go.

25:40.124 --> 25:43.127
Uh, yeah, you just have to sign
some forms at the... desk.

25:43.265 --> 25:44.750
Good luck!

25:48.236 --> 25:50.031
Curtains it is.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.999
Oh, wait.
Stop scrolling.

25:53.137 --> 25:54.449
His mom's phone number.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.451
You think Dr. Lincoln
will let me call Nadine,

25:56.589 --> 25:58.073
let her know
Jermaine's out of surgery?

25:58.211 --> 26:00.938
Nadine? What, are we on
a first-name basis with his mom?

26:01.076 --> 26:03.665
Yeah, it's called
listening to your patient.

26:03.803 --> 26:05.115
You know, compassion,

26:05.253 --> 26:07.186
bedside manner,
that kind of thing.

26:07.324 --> 26:08.946
Okay, so you're saying
I don't have any of that?

26:09.084 --> 26:10.189
Oh, you said it, not me.

26:11.397 --> 26:12.950
Sats dropped to the 70s.

26:13.088 --> 26:14.573
Heart rate
in the 140s.

26:14.711 --> 26:16.333
So in terms of
physical therapy--

26:16.471 --> 26:17.955
Dr. Lincoln!

26:18.093 --> 26:19.301
What's going on?

26:19.439 --> 26:20.855
His vitals just started plummeting.

26:20.993 --> 26:22.822
BP is now below 90/70.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.513
- Damn it.
- He was fine two minutes ago.

26:24.652 --> 26:25.791
Alright,
start him on pressors.

26:25.929 --> 26:27.482
We need to re-intubate him.
Now!

26:27.620 --> 26:29.449
Get Ndugu and get me
an intubation tray. Yeah.

26:40.219 --> 26:42.842
- I don't see anything.
- His D-dimer's elevated,

26:42.980 --> 26:44.050
his sats are failing,
he has right heart strain.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.293
- There's a clot.
- Then where is it?

26:45.431 --> 26:47.019
- Dr. Lincoln.
- I'm sorry, I'm just--

26:49.124 --> 26:51.506
Kwan,
get him away from there.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.818
Found it.

26:52.956 --> 26:54.267
Large saddle PE
at the bifurcation

26:54.405 --> 26:55.510
of his pulmonary artery.

26:55.648 --> 26:56.994
He needs an emergent embolectomy.

26:57.132 --> 26:58.824
Alright, he needs a heparin
infusion immediately.

26:58.962 --> 27:00.066
Alright, let's get to
the IR suite right now.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.412
Let's move.

27:04.692 --> 27:07.177
Half your assistant's salary
is gonna come off your side.

27:07.315 --> 27:08.799
Now,
I can't double your pay,

27:08.937 --> 27:12.492
but I am ready to offer you
25% above your initial offer.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.942
Which is insulting.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.289
75% over, and you pay
for the assistant.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.946
You know, when I look
at these halls--

27:18.084 --> 27:19.361
Oh, please.

27:19.499 --> 27:21.087
Tell me about
how you <i>served</i> again.

27:22.261 --> 27:24.263
Dr. Webber.
Dr. Altman.

27:24.401 --> 27:25.540
Uh, Shepherd?

27:25.678 --> 27:27.128
I hope
I'm not too late.

27:27.266 --> 27:29.406
I would like to be considered
for the position.

27:30.925 --> 27:32.789
Chief of surgery.

27:32.927 --> 27:34.722
You have got to be
kidding me.

27:37.552 --> 27:40.244
At 11 weeks, we can do
an in-office procedure

27:40.382 --> 27:41.970
to terminate
the pregnancy.

27:42.108 --> 27:43.316
Do you use a knife?

27:43.454 --> 27:45.974
No. We use suction.
No blades.

27:46.112 --> 27:47.424
Will you put me to sleep?

27:47.562 --> 27:48.563
Because I have
to pick up Manny,

27:48.701 --> 27:49.737
and I have to
cook them dinner.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.083
No, you'll be awake.

27:51.221 --> 27:53.395
We can even have
a volunteer take Lupe

27:53.533 --> 27:54.949
for ice cream
during the procedure.

27:57.192 --> 27:58.331
Will it hurt?

27:58.469 --> 28:00.437
You'll feel discomfort
at times,

28:00.575 --> 28:02.922
but we use an anesthetic
to numb the area.

28:10.861 --> 28:12.829
I love my kids.

28:12.967 --> 28:14.934
I want to stay alive
for them.

28:17.143 --> 28:19.076
I want to be okay
for them.

28:19.214 --> 28:21.216
I can't do this again.

28:23.805 --> 28:25.255
Okay.

28:25.393 --> 28:26.843
Do you want to assist?

28:28.983 --> 28:30.985
I'll see you in a bit.

28:36.404 --> 28:37.957
He's young,
the surgery went perfectly.

28:38.095 --> 28:40.408
I don't understand how a clot
this size formed this quickly.

28:40.546 --> 28:42.755
- It shouldn't.
- But it can.

28:42.893 --> 28:44.377
You're saying I should have
seen this coming?

28:44.515 --> 28:45.689
I'm saying there's nothing
you could have done

28:45.827 --> 28:47.242
to prevent this
from happening.

28:47.380 --> 28:48.899
Is that a V-Fib?

28:49.037 --> 28:51.177
Get me a crash cart.
I'm pulling the wire.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.733
Paddles.

28:54.871 --> 28:56.665
Charge to 150.

28:58.184 --> 29:00.324
Clear.

29:01.705 --> 29:03.293
- Push another epi.
- Charge to 200.

29:03.431 --> 29:04.950
Clear.

29:05.088 --> 29:06.261
Again.

29:06.399 --> 29:08.056
Come on, Tank.
Come on.

29:08.194 --> 29:10.300
Clear!

29:15.305 --> 29:16.202
Come on.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.514
Eyes forward, Jermaine.

29:17.652 --> 29:19.378
Eyes forward.

29:21.069 --> 29:23.416
Yes, I love you, too.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.073
If you have to leave,
it's okay.

29:25.211 --> 29:26.109
I'll be fine.

29:26.247 --> 29:27.593
He wants to stay on.

29:27.731 --> 29:28.870
Is it okay
if I'm on the phone?

29:29.008 --> 29:31.252
Of course. Yes.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.081
Okay, are you ready?

29:33.219 --> 29:34.634
Okay.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.259
I'm going to use my hands
to do a bimanual exam

29:38.397 --> 29:41.572
to determine the shape
and location of your cervix.

29:41.710 --> 29:43.954
Okay.
I wish you were here, too.

29:44.092 --> 29:46.232
Now we're going to insert
the speculum,

29:46.370 --> 29:47.647
just like a routine
pap smear.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.166
Okay.

29:49.304 --> 29:53.274
And we will hold it still
with this instrument.

29:53.412 --> 29:54.482
Okay.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.656
Alright.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.142
Now, Sierra, you may feel
some discomfort

29:59.280 --> 30:01.972
as we administer two shots
to numb the area.

30:02.110 --> 30:03.146
Okay, ready?

30:05.251 --> 30:06.425
You're doing great.

30:06.563 --> 30:08.358
Okay.

30:08.496 --> 30:10.809
Millin, we'll wait a few minutes
for the paracervical block

30:10.947 --> 30:13.190
to take effect before
we dilate the cervix.

30:13.328 --> 30:14.295
How are you doing,
Sierra?

30:14.433 --> 30:15.675
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.332
Yes, I'm still here.

30:17.470 --> 30:18.678
No, no, no. I'm fine.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.853
Okay, let's follow along
via ultrasound.

30:22.993 --> 30:24.408
It's just an ultrasound.

30:24.546 --> 30:26.134
It doesn't hurt.

30:26.272 --> 30:27.377
Gel's just cold.

30:27.515 --> 30:29.620
We'll measure the length
of her uterus

30:29.758 --> 30:31.312
before we dilate
the cervix.

30:31.450 --> 30:32.934
Okay, Sierra,
you ready?

30:34.004 --> 30:35.764
Okay, Dr. Millin,
what do you see?

30:35.903 --> 30:37.111
The uterus
is 10 centimeters.

30:37.249 --> 30:38.319
Okay, great.

30:38.457 --> 30:40.597
We're going to dilate
the cervix.

30:40.735 --> 30:41.943
Here we go.

30:43.151 --> 30:45.291
Okay.

30:45.429 --> 30:48.191
Doing great, Sierra.

30:48.329 --> 30:50.089
Okay, last one.

30:50.227 --> 30:51.401
Okay.

30:51.539 --> 30:55.198
Now, Sierra, I'm going
to use this catheter

30:55.336 --> 30:57.165
along the walls
of your uterus.

30:57.303 --> 30:58.201
Okay, are you ready?

30:58.339 --> 31:01.307
- Yes.
- Okay, here we go.

31:01.445 --> 31:02.757
Doing great.

31:02.895 --> 31:06.657
And, okay,
removing the catheter.

31:06.795 --> 31:10.040
Dr. Millin will use ultrasound
to verify completion.

31:13.492 --> 31:14.424
Uterus is clear.

31:14.562 --> 31:15.943
Okay.

31:16.081 --> 31:19.118
Removing the forceps.

31:19.256 --> 31:22.121
And removing
the speculum.

31:22.259 --> 31:23.467
That's it?

31:23.605 --> 31:24.675
And that's it.

31:24.813 --> 31:26.781
It's over.

31:26.919 --> 31:30.612
Yes, I'm okay.

31:30.750 --> 31:31.820
I'm okay.

32:11.481 --> 32:12.516
Charge again.

32:12.654 --> 32:14.553
- Link.
- Charge again!

32:14.691 --> 32:16.313
We've been doing this
for two hours, man.

32:16.451 --> 32:17.659
He's gone.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.571
Time of death...

32:32.709 --> 32:34.193
15:45.

32:37.852 --> 32:39.785
Okay.

32:39.923 --> 32:41.062
I'll walk out first.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.719
Maybe I can stall
the press.

32:42.857 --> 32:44.479
No. No.

32:45.549 --> 32:47.034
All they see is
a football player.

32:47.172 --> 32:48.587
Stats and dollar signs.

32:48.725 --> 32:51.417
He was just a kid
doing what he loved.

32:51.555 --> 32:53.143
Now he's gone.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.320
That's on me.

33:21.447 --> 33:23.760
- Mommy.
- Oh.

33:23.898 --> 33:24.968
Hey!

33:25.106 --> 33:26.038
You got that?

33:26.176 --> 33:27.936
Yeah.
Okay, so, you, um,

33:28.075 --> 33:29.559
you may experience
some cramping

33:29.697 --> 33:31.319
and some spotting
over the next few days.

33:31.457 --> 33:33.183
It's totally normal.

33:33.321 --> 33:36.807
If you feel uncomfortable,
- ibuprofen will help.
- Okay.

33:36.945 --> 33:39.810
Uh, if you feel any dizziness
or experience heavy bleeding,

33:39.948 --> 33:41.502
please call us.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.986
Thank you both.

33:43.124 --> 33:45.575
You're
an incredible mom.

33:45.713 --> 33:47.887
Come on.
Let's go.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.648
Hey.

33:49.786 --> 33:51.788
<i>Dr. Wagner in Radiology.</i>

33:53.376 --> 33:55.067
Great work today, Millin.

33:55.205 --> 33:57.690
A lot of interns
can regurgitate a textbook,

33:57.828 --> 33:59.796
but not many can talk
to a patient like you.

34:01.867 --> 34:02.937
What?

34:04.904 --> 34:08.460
I-I've just never had someone
compliment my work before.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.017
It's safe to say I-I grew up
a little left of normal.

34:14.155 --> 34:16.606
My parents taught me
to clear energy fields

34:16.744 --> 34:18.608
and roll a joint at 10.

34:18.746 --> 34:19.988
That kind of reputation

34:20.127 --> 34:23.026
didn't exactly
pave the way for success.

34:23.164 --> 34:25.649
Well, coming from someone
who didn't have

34:25.787 --> 34:28.652
the most conventional
upbringing, either...

34:28.790 --> 34:30.654
you saved that woman's
life today.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.967
You could've walked away,
but you didn't.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.176
You stayed and listened,

34:35.314 --> 34:36.936
and Sierra
is better off for it.

34:39.905 --> 34:41.424
Excuse me.

34:46.774 --> 34:48.189
...and not to mention,
I've just come off

34:48.327 --> 34:50.053
an award-winning research
project on Parkinson's,

34:50.191 --> 34:51.641
which will boost the profile
of this hospital

34:51.779 --> 34:53.229
if I'm the new chief.

34:53.367 --> 34:56.335
Are you asking for anything
specific in the offer?

34:56.473 --> 34:58.303
Well, I would need
twice the existing rate

34:58.441 --> 35:02.030
and full flexibility
to travel to visiting labs.

35:02.169 --> 35:04.757
Also, I found out what they're
paying at Seattle Pres.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.174
You should be
a little embarrassed.

35:13.835 --> 35:15.251
Why do you have to visit
other labs

35:15.389 --> 35:16.838
when we have a lab
right here for you?

35:16.976 --> 35:17.943
I don't need
to go anywhere.

35:25.088 --> 35:26.400
I'm sorry,
Dr. Shepherd.

35:26.538 --> 35:28.747
I'm unable to consider
your application.

35:28.885 --> 35:31.059
I've already offered the job
to Dr. Altman.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.580
75% above
your existing rate,

35:34.718 --> 35:36.996
a full-time administrative
assistant, and a stipend.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.343
A <i>small</i> stipend.

35:38.481 --> 35:39.551
Deal.

35:49.561 --> 35:50.700
You're welcome.

35:50.838 --> 35:53.427
What?
Bailey sent me in here.
