00:15.554 --> 00:18.848
Oh, look. Here they are. Fantastic.

00:19.724 --> 00:21.267
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:21.434 --> 00:22.435
Good morning, Ella.

00:22.643 --> 00:25.563
- Hi.
- Happy birthday, Sydney.

00:25.771 --> 00:28.440
- You ready for your party?
- She's been ready for a month.

00:28.607 --> 00:32.360
We’re going to the aquarium,
and then we’re having a puppy party.

00:32.653 --> 00:36.323
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.
- I put her present in Ella's backpack.

00:36.489 --> 00:38.908
- Thanks.
- You’re awful brave taking this on alone.

00:39.075 --> 00:43.079
- Hey, you’re welcome to come with us.
- Yeah, Mommy. Come with us, please?

00:43.246 --> 00:45.247
Oh, Ella. I have to work in the hospital.

00:45.873 --> 00:49.668
I'd come if I could, but I have to do
a pancreaticojejunostomy at 9.

00:50.002 --> 00:52.671
- No problem.
- I'll come another time. I promise.

00:53.338 --> 00:55.215
- You have fun at the party.
- Okay.

00:55.382 --> 00:57.342
Thanks, Dave.
I'll pick her up around 6.

00:57.509 --> 01:00.803
- They'll be into their sugar rush by then.
- Marvelous.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.472
All right, girls. Love you.

01:02.638 --> 01:04.056
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:04.223 --> 01:07.143
Do you think I could talk to
the Infectious Disease department?

01:07.309 --> 01:10.896
It would be great to compare adherence
statistics for HIV patients in Chicago.

01:11.063 --> 01:13.357
- I could arrange that.
- And it would be helpful...

01:13.523 --> 01:15.650
...if I could spend time
in your clinical lab.

01:15.817 --> 01:18.069
Though the chances of us
getting one are remote...

01:18.236 --> 01:21.489
...I'd love to take a look at the
current-generation flow cytometer.

01:21.698 --> 01:24.909
Hand-counting lymphocytes under
a microscope is the best I can do now.

01:25.076 --> 01:26.452
I gotta check with Dr. Weaver.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.871
- Frank, have you seen Dr. Weaver?
- Try the lounge.

01:29.038 --> 01:30.581
Be right back.

01:32.791 --> 01:34.584
Breakfast pirogi?

01:36.002 --> 01:40.173
His dedication to the staff
and patients will be hard to...

01:40.340 --> 01:43.384
- Kerry. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
- You didn't.

01:43.551 --> 01:45.803
- Have you seen Dr. Lewis?
- No. I just got on.

01:45.970 --> 01:48.264
Would you mind if Kem
observed today?

01:48.430 --> 01:49.723
Yeah.

01:50.057 --> 01:52.100
She has her Master's degree
in public health.

01:52.309 --> 01:53.894
That's no reason to punish her.

01:54.061 --> 01:57.063
Give the poor woman a credit card,
Carter. Let her have some fun.

01:57.314 --> 02:00.692
I tried that. She would like to speak
to the Public Health nurses...

02:00.858 --> 02:02.735
...see how we track
communicable diseases.

02:02.902 --> 02:05.363
Sure. Maybe she can motivate
some of these slackers.

02:05.571 --> 02:06.947
- Frank, where's Lewis?
- Got me.

02:07.114 --> 02:10.908
Okay, I want everybody in the lobby
at 9 for the dedication.

02:11.076 --> 02:12.286
What dedication?

02:12.452 --> 02:15.956
They’re renaming the hospital
Romano Memorial.

02:16.122 --> 02:18.833
- Not kidding.
- Where's Kem?

02:22.670 --> 02:26.549
Do the patients with sexually transmitted
infections get routine HIV testing?

02:26.715 --> 02:28.592
Sometimes. Depends on the doctor.

02:28.759 --> 02:31.929
- Do you refer them to your STI clinic?
- I don't think we have one.

02:32.095 --> 02:34.973
- You talked to Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah. She said everything's fine.

02:35.098 --> 02:37.017
Kem's gonna be hanging out today.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.184
Why?

02:39.602 --> 02:41.270
Morning, folks.

02:41.437 --> 02:42.939
- Ride-along?
- Yep.

02:43.147 --> 02:46.150
Interns have to do paramedic
ride-alongs twice a year.

02:46.275 --> 02:48.569
- Lets them see real medicine.
- Yeah, right.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.572
You might want a couple steroids
before lifting this one, doc.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.990
31-year-old male, fell down
a flight of stairs...

02:54.157 --> 02:56.451
...complains of back and
diffuse abdominal pain.

02:56.618 --> 02:59.454
Frank, did any labs come back
on the Gorham kid?

03:00.079 --> 03:03.875
- Frank? You all right?
- I think I'm having a heart attack.

03:04.041 --> 03:06.252
- Are you kidding?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

03:06.419 --> 03:12.049
Okay, here. Here, sit down. Sit down.
I need some nitro over here.

03:16.136 --> 03:17.971
That feels a lot better.

03:18.138 --> 03:21.474
You know, I bet it was just
those breakfast pirogis. Thanks.

03:21.641 --> 03:25.436
- Hey, check you out, Mr. GQ.
- What, you have a deportation hearing?

03:25.603 --> 03:26.687
Have another pirogi, Frank.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.647
Luka, could use a set of hands here.

03:28.814 --> 03:30.524
- I'm not on.
- Just for the transfer.

03:30.691 --> 03:33.026
- Where's Dr. Lewis?
- Did you check the on-call room?

03:33.193 --> 03:34.820
- She was sleeping.
- Are you kidding?

03:35.070 --> 03:36.988
She didn't feel well.
Do you need something?

03:37.197 --> 03:39.240
Yeah. I need someone
to run the department.

03:39.407 --> 03:41.576
- Can't help you there.
- Hey, Susan.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.953
The Medical Executive Committee
has authorized...

03:44.203 --> 03:46.747
...a nationwide search to look
for Romano's replacement.

03:46.914 --> 03:50.167
Until we can find a suitable candidate,
we'd like you to step in.

03:51.126 --> 03:54.588
Kerry, thank you for the vote
of confidence, but I...

03:54.754 --> 03:56.298
I'll pass. I'm going home.

03:56.506 --> 03:59.842
- It's an extra 3 grand a month.
- Do med students qualify?

04:00.009 --> 04:03.221
- I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested.
- Why not?

04:05.848 --> 04:08.017
I'm pregnant.

04:13.063 --> 04:14.731
Cleanup on aisle five.

05:06.219 --> 05:08.262
I'll phone upstairs as soon
as I'm done here.

05:08.429 --> 05:12.433
Please let me sit up.
I can't catch my breath.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.435
You got too much
weight on your chest.

05:14.601 --> 05:16.019
We need to get an x-ray of your neck.

05:16.103 --> 05:17.187
No, you don't.

05:17.354 --> 05:20.023
Yeah. We can use the NEXUS criteria.

05:20.232 --> 05:24.277
If he's alert and sober...

05:24.444 --> 05:26.404
...without any focal neural deficits
distracting injury or neck pain,

05:26.487 --> 05:28.114
then he's low risk for a C-spine fracture.

05:28.322 --> 05:30.074
- Any pain in here, sir?
- No.

05:30.283 --> 05:33.369
- What are you doing here today?
- I'm giving a lecture to students...

05:33.535 --> 05:36.955
...on clinical decision-making
without the use of ancillary tests.

05:37.122 --> 05:39.374
Look towards me.
Now look at Dr. Kovac.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.251
- Any pain there?
- No.

05:41.459 --> 05:43.962
- That's cool.
- Our health-care system requires us...

05:44.129 --> 05:46.255
...to diagnose with a minimum of tests.

05:46.339 --> 05:47.799
Maybe Kem can sit in on your lecture.

05:47.965 --> 05:50.551
She's doing a little recon
in the hospital today.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.887
- I never taught in a classroom.
- Oh, you're a natural.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.973
Okay, his neck's clear.
Let's sit him up.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.975
Ready? One, two, three, go.

05:59.351 --> 06:01.728
HemoCue's 12.8.
Trauma labs drawn.

06:02.103 --> 06:05.607
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
All he needs is a CBC and UA.

06:05.773 --> 06:08.609
Abdominal pain meets trauma
guidelines. I'm sending a panel.

06:08.776 --> 06:11.862
There's no rebound or guarding.
He doesn't need LFTs, amylase.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.781
Doesn't need to be typed and crossed.

06:13.864 --> 06:14.948
Nurses follow protocols.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.525
- They're unnecessary.
- You know what?

06:16.692 --> 06:20.370
Save the lectures for your med students.
The nurses don't want to hear it.

06:23.039 --> 06:25.917
Weaver says to get your butts
in the lobby pronto.

06:27.543 --> 06:31.130
Dr. Robert Romano was a fixture
in this hospital for years.

06:31.380 --> 06:34.883
His dedication to the staff
and patients will be hard to forget.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.511
And his generosity continues even now.

06:37.678 --> 06:39.805
- Hey, how you doing?
- Very good, thank you.

06:39.971 --> 06:43.516
A significant portion of Dr. Romano's
estate was left to this hospital...

06:43.725 --> 06:46.352
...to further our service
of this community.

06:46.519 --> 06:50.815
And to that end, I am pleased
to announce the creation of...

06:52.358 --> 06:56.403
...the Robert Romano Center
for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual...

06:56.570 --> 06:58.947
...and Transgendered Healthcare.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.242
This new facility will provide
the latest in health services...

07:02.409 --> 07:04.327
...to those patients and their families.

07:04.494 --> 07:06.537
- She didn't.
- Oh, yes, she did.

07:06.704 --> 07:10.082
All right, that's it. Back to work.
Pratt, you missed your appointment...

07:10.249 --> 07:12.710
- ... with Bob Harris in Risk Management.
- I was busy.

07:12.877 --> 07:16.380
I got you another appointment
in 30 minutes. Don't be late.

07:17.798 --> 07:20.008
Is it just me, or do the eyes
seem to follow you?

07:20.258 --> 07:22.886
Was Romano's prosthetic arm
destroyed in the accident?

07:23.053 --> 07:24.637
- Why?
- Because if it wasn't...

07:24.804 --> 07:27.640
...it's gonna hunt Dr. Weaver down
and strangle her.

07:27.807 --> 07:30.559
- He wasn't a big supporter of gay rights?
- No. Not really.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.561
That's too creepy.

07:33.729 --> 07:35.731
Did I miss the dedication?

07:35.898 --> 07:38.233
More like post-mortem payback.

07:41.236 --> 07:43.238
Oh, my God.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.408
All right, looks clear to me.
What do you think?

07:47.575 --> 07:49.952
I think we should discuss it over dinner.

07:50.494 --> 07:52.329
- Really?
- You like Moroccan?

07:52.496 --> 07:54.832
- I'll eat just about anything.
- Pratt!

07:54.957 --> 07:58.418
Approximately 20-year-old male,
feet versus tree at 30 miles per hour.

07:58.585 --> 08:00.712
Was he thrown from a car?
This thing is frozen.

08:00.879 --> 08:04.382
His buddies wrapped him up, tied him
to a toboggan and sent him down a hill.

08:04.549 --> 08:06.926
He bounced off the tree
and wound up in a creek.

08:07.135 --> 08:10.262
I can palpate a decent carotid,
but we can't get his arm out for a BP.

08:10.429 --> 08:13.641
- It looks like bilateral foot fracture.
- We may have a spinal injury.

08:13.807 --> 08:16.185
- Maybe we should get Carter.
- What's wrong with you?

08:16.393 --> 08:17.686
Come find me later.

08:17.853 --> 08:21.523
Get 10 liters of warm irrigation solution
so we can throw off this blanket.

08:21.690 --> 08:25.401
And let's cut off this tape
so we can do a proper assessment.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.280
I hate this time of year.

08:29.488 --> 08:32.198
We must get 30 slip-and-fall calls
a week. Right, Bardelli?

08:32.366 --> 08:33.784
- At least.
- Here's an idea.

08:33.951 --> 08:38.121
If it's icy, and you're old, don't go
outside. Save yourself a broken hip.

08:38.288 --> 08:41.332
I told you what would happen
if you didn't listen.

08:41.499 --> 08:43.626
You call 911 for paramedics?

08:43.835 --> 08:45.295
- Feel like a threat?
- Screw you!

08:45.461 --> 08:47.213
Hello? Someone hurt in there?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.882
Stop it! You're hurting me. Stop!

08:49.966 --> 08:51.300
I'll call the police.

08:51.884 --> 08:53.969
Hold on. What are we doing?
We need to get in.

08:54.136 --> 08:56.805
- Not till the police get here.
- What if he's hurting her?

08:57.014 --> 09:00.517
We wait for the cops. EMT got shot
last year going in without backup.

09:00.684 --> 09:02.143
- Open the door!
- Leave me alone!

09:02.310 --> 09:04.854
Just shut up!
Just shut up for five minutes!

09:06.272 --> 09:09.984
You enter two pages of demographics
for every patient that walks in?

09:10.151 --> 09:12.278
- Yes.
- What do you do with the information?

09:12.444 --> 09:14.446
That's really up
to the Public Health geeks.

09:14.613 --> 09:17.824
Do you use it to track down patients
who leave without being seen?

09:17.991 --> 09:19.659
You have to ask one of the docs.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.203
So how many people leave
without seeing a doctor?

09:22.412 --> 09:24.706
Look, lady, I just work here.

09:24.873 --> 09:27.500
What kind of training
do you need for this job?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.962
Dr. Weaver, do you know how many
patients leave without medical attention?

09:32.129 --> 09:34.381
How about calling off
this grand inquisition?

09:34.548 --> 09:37.843
- Somewhere around 5 percent.
- Some of us are trying to work here.

09:38.510 --> 09:41.346
Hi. I just got off the phone
with Dr. Farina.

09:41.513 --> 09:44.849
Someone's gonna phone me back
about letting you take a tour of the lab.

09:45.016 --> 09:46.059
That's great.

09:46.142 --> 09:48.631
You wanna catch Luka's lecture?
I'll just have you paged.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.438
Luka didn't seem too keen on the idea.

09:50.604 --> 09:53.440
- He's shy. He'll appreciate the interest.
- Kerry...

09:53.607 --> 09:56.860
...are we truly to believe that Robert
left a substantial donation...

09:57.069 --> 09:59.237
...to establish
a gay and lesbian centre?

09:59.404 --> 10:02.443
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgendered.

10:02.478 --> 10:03.535
Whatever the hell that means.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.369
The actual designation was left
to the discretion of the board.

10:06.536 --> 10:09.830
This is the one area where we felt
that County was truly lacking.

10:09.997 --> 10:12.541
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

10:15.627 --> 10:17.838
Morales, the police are here, man.
Come on.

10:18.005 --> 10:20.006
Just relax, man.

10:21.675 --> 10:25.553
Listen, there's a woman inside.
It sounds like she's being killed.

10:27.346 --> 10:29.473
This is the police department.
Open the door.

10:29.682 --> 10:31.851
- Get out of here!
- This is my apartment!

10:32.017 --> 10:33.143
- Back up.
- Back up.

10:33.310 --> 10:34.728
Stop!

10:36.146 --> 10:37.898
Sit down, sir! Sit down!

10:38.065 --> 10:40.066
- She tripped.
- Ma'am, are you okay?

10:40.233 --> 10:42.068
- He pushed me.
- She's drunk. She tripped.

10:42.235 --> 10:45.071
- Sit down now, sir!
- You're the drunk, you liar.

10:45.238 --> 10:47.949
- You better take a look at her.
- I'm gonna kill you. Bitch.

10:48.116 --> 10:50.201
- Quiet down.
- I swear to God I'll kill you.

10:50.368 --> 10:52.912
- Enough of that.
- It's all your fault.

10:53.204 --> 10:57.708
Patients with peripheral vertigo
do not require CT scanning.

10:57.874 --> 11:01.586
What clinical test will diagnose BPPV?

11:01.753 --> 11:03.588
Anyone?

11:05.590 --> 11:07.216
Sheila?

11:08.509 --> 11:10.761
- Could you repeat that last part?
- Come on, guys.

11:10.928 --> 11:12.680
Positional test for vertigo.

11:18.685 --> 11:20.770
Rectal temp is 87. 6.

11:20.937 --> 11:23.273
- I think he's coming around.
- What's your name?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.358
- Doug.
- You want to tell me what happened?

11:25.525 --> 11:26.818
Talk to me.

11:26.984 --> 11:28.402
Hockey initiation.

11:28.569 --> 11:30.279
- I'm cold.
- We're working on that.

11:30.446 --> 11:32.323
Pleural lavage
with bilateral chest tubes?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.784
- No, let's do external rewarming.
- He's groggy and under 89 degrees.

11:35.909 --> 11:38.704
- That's criteria for active rewarming.
- He's progressing.

11:38.912 --> 11:41.456
Get a warming blanket, heated IV fluids,
and heated 02.

11:41.623 --> 11:44.459
- What happen to him?
- Doug's friends took him sledding...

11:44.626 --> 11:48.337
...and he wound up swimming. Temp,
87. 6. We're using passive rewarming.

11:48.504 --> 11:51.132
- Rest of the vitals?
- BP is good, 112/78.

11:51.298 --> 11:53.592
Pulse, 106. Sinus tach on the monitor.

11:53.759 --> 11:56.386
- Films?
- Bilateral calcaneal fractures.

11:56.553 --> 12:00.515
And a compression fracture of L5.
Doug, can you wiggle your toes?

12:01.057 --> 12:03.351
Can you wiggle your toes, Doug?

12:04.102 --> 12:06.229
Let's get an MRI to rule out
spinal-cord injury.

12:06.479 --> 12:09.523
No. Lumbar compression fractures
almost never have cord involvement.

12:09.690 --> 12:11.942
- He can't move his toes.
- It's from the frostbite.

12:12.109 --> 12:15.571
Try some warm-water immersion.
Yeah. DTRs are 2 plus and equal.

12:15.737 --> 12:17.573
- How's the rectal temp?
- Pretty normal.

12:17.739 --> 12:21.243
Good. Sacral nerves are intact. S2, 3, 4
keeps the poop off the floor.

12:21.409 --> 12:24.162
- Sensory loss in his toes.
- The distribution of a dermatome.

12:24.329 --> 12:27.415
Warm up the toes and reassess.
No MRI.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.169
- I can't feel my toes.
- We're warming them up, Doug.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.255
No, I can't feel anything.
What's happening?

12:35.714 --> 12:37.841
You broke both your heels
and a vertebrae.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.344
- What, my back's broken?
- It's a compression fracture.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.056
- Your legs took most of the impact.
- So am I paralyzed?

12:45.223 --> 12:48.351
- We're still waiting.
- No, am I paralyzed? Just tell me.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.022
- Get the MRI.
- Look, can you call my dad?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.858
- Can somebody call my dad?
- But Dr. Carter said-

12:56.024 --> 12:57.693
Just do it.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.529
Dr. Pratt, you're a hard man
to track down.

13:00.695 --> 13:03.073
Bob Harris. I'm with
the Risk Management department.

13:03.239 --> 13:05.658
- I can't talk now.
- I realize you're busy.

13:05.825 --> 13:08.286
I need you to write up
your recollections of a case...

13:08.494 --> 13:11.330
...regarding an MVA patient,
Martin Brodie. He suffered from-

13:11.539 --> 13:15.000
Ankylosing spondylitis. The disease
turned the guy's neck into a breadstick.

13:15.167 --> 13:18.378
Were the injuries from the car accident
exacerbated by his condition?

13:18.545 --> 13:20.922
He came in having trouble breathing.
I tried to help.

13:21.089 --> 13:24.384
- And there were complications.
- Look, I snapped the guy's neck.

13:24.551 --> 13:25.760
Now he's a quadriplegic.

13:25.927 --> 13:28.888
The insurance settlement on this one
is gonna be in the millions.

13:29.055 --> 13:33.392
Do you have any idea how much 24/7
nursing care in a state facility costs?

13:33.559 --> 13:36.528
Martin Brodie's a 19-year-old boy
looking at what?

13:36.562 --> 13:40.065
Forty, 50 more years
of total paralysis.

13:40.524 --> 13:43.151
Have your notes on my desk by 9 a. m.

13:45.361 --> 13:46.821
See you, bitch.

13:46.988 --> 13:50.032
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- I hope he rots in jail.

13:50.241 --> 13:54.495
Pulse, 105. BP, 118/82 with
decent sats around 94 percent.

13:54.662 --> 13:56.705
Smells like her blood alcohol's
the same.

13:56.872 --> 14:00.750
From what I can tell, these lacerations
are superficial and both her lungs are up.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.669
Is there any chest pain? Belly pain?

14:02.836 --> 14:05.588
- Hey, Amy, stay with us.
- Where did he go?

14:05.755 --> 14:08.382
- He's been arrested.
- Listen, she's gonna need a head CT.

14:08.591 --> 14:12.469
Keep her on the monitor, stand by with
a tube in case she starts to go south.

14:14.346 --> 14:17.307
Wait. Do you hear something?
Sounds like a kid crying.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.228
Wait! Wait, wait!
It's just a kid. It's just a kid.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.023
Drop the gun, son.

14:26.774 --> 14:28.818
I thought you were my dad.

14:33.045 --> 14:36.966
With a normal neurologic exam
and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15...

14:37.133 --> 14:39.218
...you do not need a head CT,

14:39.301 --> 14:41.970
and you save $2000 in health-care costs.

14:42.137 --> 14:46.057
We do about10 unnecessary scans a day.

14:46.182 --> 14:47.475
Dr. Kovac.

14:48.226 --> 14:51.479
The costs to procure and maintain
the CT scanner...

14:51.646 --> 14:53.981
...are relatively fixed, am I right?

14:54.190 --> 14:55.191
Yeah.

14:55.316 --> 14:57.651
So if you eliminated half the scans...

14:57.818 --> 15:00.988
...wouldn't that then double
the costs of the tests you did do?

15:01.155 --> 15:03.949
I mean, there'd be no real savings
in health-care dollars...

15:04.116 --> 15:06.660
...and the patient would
be billed twice as much.

15:07.661 --> 15:09.913
Wouldn't the real solution be...

15:10.079 --> 15:13.291
...to have several hospitals
share one scanner?

15:14.041 --> 15:17.253
Did you send Mrs. Wintermute
to Radiology?

15:17.419 --> 15:20.172
- No. I sent her home.
- What about her abdominal pain?

15:20.672 --> 15:22.716
It was more discomfort than pain.

15:22.883 --> 15:25.886
Her husband's been off work
with a workers' comp claim.

15:26.052 --> 15:27.887
Her son moved home
with his daughter...

15:28.054 --> 15:31.849
- ... while going through a divorce.
- What, you get her whole family history?

15:32.016 --> 15:35.603
Half the people that come in here
just wanna talk to somebody.

15:35.770 --> 15:37.271
How's your son doing?

15:38.188 --> 15:41.066
Fine. He hasn't given himself
a thoracotomy. That's good news.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.569
- He'll probably end up a brain surgeon.
- Yeah. Or a grave robber.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.572
You're a glass-half-full kind of guy,
huh?

15:47.739 --> 15:50.366
- Hey, how's the teaching going?
- Ask Kem.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.952
She seems to be doing most
of the talking.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.205
- Yeah. She can be a little inquisitive.
- Yeah.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.790
I'll talk to her.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.709
Don't these patients have
primary-care doctors?

16:00.876 --> 16:03.670
There's a three-month wait
to be seen at the clinic.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.632
Hello, Mrs. Lemonier. I'm Neela.

16:08.591 --> 16:10.969
I don't speak good English.

16:11.135 --> 16:14.180
Can you tell me what's wrong?
Why you're here?

16:15.890 --> 16:19.768
- My children are sick.
- You don't sound very well yourself.

16:26.399 --> 16:28.234
She's from Haiti.

16:30.653 --> 16:32.071
Do you recognize that?

16:32.196 --> 16:35.241
- Pneumonitis?
- It sounds like pertussis.

16:35.408 --> 16:37.785
- Whooping cough, really?
- Hey, there you are.

16:37.952 --> 16:41.914
John, I think this woman
has pertussis. Is that possible?

16:42.122 --> 16:43.790
Yeah. We get the odd case.

16:43.957 --> 16:45.375
In Chicago?

16:45.542 --> 16:47.711
- How's the lecture going?
- Interesting.

16:47.877 --> 16:49.629
Luka's an excellent teacher.

16:50.338 --> 16:52.965
I should get back, but I think
Neela needs a translator.

16:53.132 --> 16:55.551
I think we can probably manage that.

16:55.718 --> 16:59.221
Dr. Farina is ready to give you a tour
of the Infectious Disease department.

16:59.430 --> 17:02.307
- What about the lecture?
- I think he'll understand.

17:02.516 --> 17:05.101
Hey, Neela, can you take Kem
up to five west?

17:05.268 --> 17:07.604
- Certainly.
- If you see Luka, tell him I'm sorry...

17:07.771 --> 17:10.732
- ... I missed the rest of his lecture.
- Find me when you're done.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.525
Check out that woman.

17:12.983 --> 17:14.652
- Is that the domestic?
- Yeah.

17:14.819 --> 17:17.279
Superficial lacs, maybe a broken arm.
We got a kid too.

17:17.445 --> 17:19.781
He almost shot Gallant's head off.

17:21.157 --> 17:23.535
So how are you liking Chicago?

17:23.702 --> 17:26.788
It's very nice.

17:27.955 --> 17:31.542
- How long have you been here?
- I've been in America for seven years.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.920
Chicago for the last three.

17:34.128 --> 17:35.629
Do you like it?

17:35.796 --> 17:40.592
I still feel like I'm getting settled in, but
it's quite pleasant for a big city, really.

17:40.759 --> 17:44.012
- Although it's not quite London.
- No.

17:44.221 --> 17:46.264
Or Paris.

17:46.723 --> 17:48.475
No.

17:48.641 --> 17:50.643
It's much more agreeable
in the summer.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.271
- A tad warmer too.
- That is good to know.

17:53.521 --> 17:56.649
- And the people are friendly enough.
- Yeah.

17:56.816 --> 17:59.818
They're larger than I expected,
the people.

18:00.819 --> 18:04.156
Yeah. They're quite fond
of their giant portions here.

18:04.322 --> 18:06.908
Big Gulp, supersize,
monster fries, all that.

18:07.075 --> 18:10.370
I saw a woman drinking a bucket
of coffee this morning.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.288
Actually, that's quite common.

18:14.248 --> 18:16.000
- Is this a Med-Surg admit?
- Yep.

18:16.167 --> 18:20.087
- Let's run in a gram of Ancef too.
- No. I just wanna go home.

18:20.254 --> 18:22.506
Okay. I'll see what we can do.

18:22.673 --> 18:24.633
How are we doing over here?

18:25.175 --> 18:28.261
That's okay, Rudy.
Dr. Carter's one of the good guys.

18:28.428 --> 18:30.513
He's gonna help out
you and your mom.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.807
- Physically, he's fine.
- How are you?

18:32.974 --> 18:34.850
My ears are still ringing,
but I'm cool.

18:35.017 --> 18:38.229
- Did you call DCFS?
- Yeah.

18:38.395 --> 18:42.691
Okay. Rudy, I'll be back in a little bit
to check in on you and your mom, okay?

18:43.900 --> 18:47.821
Vitals Q 30 minutes and CBC in an hour
and set up a suture set with 4-0 nylon.

18:47.987 --> 18:50.490
- Thanks.
- Doug, how are you feeling?

18:50.657 --> 18:52.450
- Better. Warmer.
- Good.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.827
- Where is he coming from?
- MRI.

18:54.994 --> 18:57.788
- I said he didn't need that.
- Pratt thought otherwise.

18:58.330 --> 19:01.583
Look, it's not my job to make sure
your residents listen to you.

19:03.835 --> 19:06.713
I'm getting tired of doctors
thinking that we work for them...

19:06.921 --> 19:10.508
- ... or that they can tell us what to do.
- The patients think it works that way.

19:10.675 --> 19:13.386
- I'm staying out of this conversation.
- What's with Kovac...

19:13.553 --> 19:16.722
...and his holier-than-thou
healing hand? I'm getting sick of that.

19:16.806 --> 19:20.309
Oh, I don't know. Those healing hands
have their good points. Right, Abby?

19:21.393 --> 19:24.813
- Did you go out with Kovac?
- Briefly, yeah.

19:25.021 --> 19:26.523
- And Carter?
- Yep.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.442
- Abby's the ER slut.
- I went out with two doctors...

19:29.609 --> 19:31.569
...in the five years
that I've worked here.

19:31.736 --> 19:34.071
Hey, Abby. Are we still on for tonight?

19:34.280 --> 19:35.906
- Yeah.
- Great.

19:38.909 --> 19:41.078
We're studying.

19:41.286 --> 19:42.913
And you shouldn't talk, Chuny.

19:45.248 --> 19:47.584
Kovac gets around.

19:51.713 --> 19:54.799
Our goal is to get all of our
triple-combination-therapy patients...

19:54.966 --> 19:56.759
...to an undetectable viral load.

19:56.926 --> 19:59.678
I'd be ecstatic just to be able
to follow CD4 counts.

20:00.262 --> 20:02.764
Would it be possible for me
to visit the AIDS ward?

20:02.931 --> 20:04.433
It would if we had one.

20:04.599 --> 20:07.519
Fifteen years ago we had
an entire floor of AIDS patients.

20:07.686 --> 20:11.356
Now the few inpatients we care for
are on the general medical service.

20:11.522 --> 20:14.108
We had a gentleman earlier
in the week with Kaposi's...

20:14.275 --> 20:16.110
...but he was discharged yesterday.

20:16.235 --> 20:18.112
It is so different
from what I deal with.

20:18.279 --> 20:20.906
I see thousands of deaths
from opportunistic infections.

20:21.115 --> 20:24.201
Well, you're welcome to observe
in the outpatient clinic.

20:28.371 --> 20:30.665
These are your AIDS patients?

20:32.375 --> 20:34.961
Breath sounds diminished
on the left, I think.

20:35.127 --> 20:36.545
He has a scar over his fifth rib.

20:36.629 --> 20:37.671
From a chest tube.

20:37.838 --> 20:41.175
That's right. Some quack
stuck one in me last year.

20:41.383 --> 20:44.052
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- Not if we can help it.

20:44.219 --> 20:46.721
Did you send the human
toboggan for an MRI?

20:46.888 --> 20:49.140
- I was trying-
- I told you it was unnecessary.

20:49.307 --> 20:52.393
The guy started freaking out.
He was worried about paralysis.

20:52.602 --> 20:54.812
- And you...?
- I was trying to be thorough.

20:54.979 --> 20:58.566
So was I. Next time you disagree with
my orders, come and talk to me about it.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.025
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.194
You ready to present this?

21:02.361 --> 21:03.612
Neela.

21:03.820 --> 21:06.990
Mr. Morgan is 64.
He has Wegener's granulomatosis...

21:07.157 --> 21:09.534
...which is an inflammation
of the respiratory tract.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.495
- Vitals are in the normal range.
- He's only satting at 92?

21:12.662 --> 21:15.665
- He's not taking any deep breaths.
- Because it hurts like hell.

21:15.831 --> 21:18.876
- I told you that already.
- Sounds like pleural effusion.

21:19.418 --> 21:23.130
- Yeah. He needs to do a thoracentesis.
- I've already paged Pulmonology.

21:23.297 --> 21:25.674
That's good. As long as
Mr. Morgan doesn't mind...

21:25.841 --> 21:27.801
...gasping for air
until sometime tomorrow.

21:27.967 --> 21:30.929
Tomorrow? I could be dead by then.

21:34.557 --> 21:37.935
He's had a number of bronchoscopies.
They put his lung down last year...

21:38.102 --> 21:40.687
...doing a thoracentesis
and had to put in a chest tube.

21:40.854 --> 21:43.315
- He'll be better off if they do it upstairs.
- He will?

21:43.523 --> 21:45.567
- Yeah.
- Or you will?

21:46.192 --> 21:48.194
You send a guy for an MRI
he doesn't need...

21:48.361 --> 21:50.363
...because you're worried
about paralysis.

21:50.530 --> 21:52.240
Now you don't want a thoracentesis.

21:52.407 --> 21:54.951
- So?
- So sounds to me...

21:55.117 --> 21:57.661
...like you're still
a little gun-shy from:

21:57.912 --> 21:59.621
Breaking that kid's neck.

21:59.830 --> 22:02.040
The man has tons of scar tissue
around his lung.

22:02.207 --> 22:06.544
Besides, a thoracentesis down here
only opens him up for a risk of infection.

22:06.711 --> 22:08.213
Okay.

22:08.713 --> 22:13.426
I'll do it. Neela, would you set me up
for a thoracentesis, please?

22:15.136 --> 22:18.847
Betadine the chest. Load up a syringe
with 1 percent of lido. I got this.

22:19.014 --> 22:21.934
- I really don't mind doing it.
- I said, I got this.

22:23.435 --> 22:26.641
Mr. Morgan. We're gonna sit you up
and drain some of the fluid...

22:26.676 --> 22:29.399
- ... out of your lungs so you can breathe.
- It's about time.

22:29.566 --> 22:32.485
- Does this guy know what he's doing?
- You are in good hands.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.446
- Yeah.
- And I'll be back in a little bit.

22:44.913 --> 22:48.083
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Hey, you back already?

22:48.249 --> 22:50.752
- You should come and see this patient.
- Okay.

22:50.918 --> 22:52.712
How did it go with Dr. Farina?

22:52.879 --> 22:56.090
He was very nice and generous
with his time and his data.

22:56.257 --> 22:59.760
But I'm still 10 years away
from the results he's getting.

23:04.014 --> 23:06.349
Are you finished with Mr. Yarrow?
Leg lac in 2?

23:06.516 --> 23:09.602
Yeah, he's good.
Just wash out the wound...

23:09.769 --> 23:12.230
...give him a tetanus shot,
8 of morphine.

23:12.397 --> 23:14.440
- Anything else?
- That should do it.

23:14.607 --> 23:16.984
- Have you ever heard of Echo Free?
- Let me guess.

23:17.193 --> 23:19.320
Something that Kovac does
instead of pain meds.

23:19.486 --> 23:22.239
No. It's a club on LaSalle.
My friend deejays there.

23:22.406 --> 23:26.451
A bunch of us are going tonight if you
don't mind hanging around with nurses.

23:26.618 --> 23:29.996
I don't think I'd be much good tonight.
I'm having a bad day.

23:30.163 --> 23:32.123
All the more reason to go out with us.

23:32.290 --> 23:34.625
Nurses make people feel better
all the time.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.670
- Hey, Pratt. Pick up line six.
- Hey, take a message.

23:37.836 --> 23:40.672
It's Dr. Chen. She's calling from
Shoo Goo... Kin Doo...

23:40.839 --> 23:42.466
- Okay.
- Somewhere in China.

23:42.674 --> 23:44.676
I have to take this.

23:47.345 --> 23:48.972
Hey, what's up?

23:50.431 --> 23:52.683
What? When?

23:53.309 --> 23:55.311
- What room is Mr. Yardley in?
- I'm sorry.

23:55.478 --> 23:57.897
Listen, it's not your fault, Jing-Mei.
You know that.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.773
A pulseless foot?
You paged a surgeon?

23:59.982 --> 24:02.401
You just stay focused on
getting your father better.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.860
Dr. Lawson came and got him.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.196
- No, no. I was talking to somebody else.
- Who?

24:06.363 --> 24:09.324
The radiologist took him down
for an angiogram and wound up...

24:09.491 --> 24:12.577
...giving him angioplasty
and putting in a stint. He's good.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.245
- Yeah, I know.
- That's wonderful.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.081
Someone could have called
to tell me I didn't need to come.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.209
Dr. Pratt, Mr. Morgan's
dropped his pressure, 86/66.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.587
All right, look, I've gotta take this.
Here, talk to Dr. Chen.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.714
Her mother just died.

24:30.760 --> 24:36.348
All right. Let's get Bordetella PCR,
pertussis serologies and a culture.

24:59.328 --> 25:01.788
- Did you get all that?
- She has another kid?

25:01.997 --> 25:04.458
Eighteen-month-old.
He's at home with her sick mother.

25:04.624 --> 25:07.544
Well, they both need to come in.
They're both probably infected.

25:07.711 --> 25:11.047
The grandmother won't come.
She doesn't trust American doctors.

25:11.255 --> 25:14.050
That's a problem.
Can't treat them unless they come in.

25:14.258 --> 25:17.344
- What if we go there?
- This is America.

25:17.511 --> 25:18.929
We don't make house calls.

25:20.973 --> 25:22.391
Don't.

25:22.557 --> 25:23.850
What?

25:24.017 --> 25:25.810
You know what.

25:26.978 --> 25:31.024
I'm not leaving the hospital.
Do you see how many patients I have?

25:33.067 --> 25:34.819
Okay, I mean it. Stop it.

25:39.114 --> 25:42.242
Gallant, I need you guys
to make a run for me.

25:42.409 --> 25:45.829
I'd like to stick around with Rudy here.
Just until DCFS shows up.

25:45.996 --> 25:49.999
- After that, then.
- Carter! Pratt needs you in Exam 3.

25:51.334 --> 25:52.877
- Sats, 78.
- It's a tension pneumo.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.755
- Sixteen-gauge Angiocath and Betadine.
- He's not breathing.

25:55.963 --> 25:58.173
- Should I bag him?
- It'll make the pneumo worse.

25:58.340 --> 26:00.134
Open a chest-tube tray. Size 8. 5 gloves.

26:00.217 --> 26:01.301
Heart rate's dropping.

26:01.468 --> 26:04.346
- Do you want a crash cart?
- All right, slow down. ABCs.

26:04.471 --> 26:06.306
- I know what the problem is.
- Treat it.

26:06.473 --> 26:07.682
No pulse.

26:07.849 --> 26:09.517
- He's not breathing.
- Okay, bag him.

26:09.684 --> 26:12.687
I knew this was gonna happen.
I wanted Pulmonology to do it.

26:12.854 --> 26:14.855
It takes a minute
for the lung to re-expand.

26:15.022 --> 26:17.608
- Chest tube is definitive.
- Pressure's 94/62. Coming up.

26:17.775 --> 26:19.526
- Ten blade.
- He's waking up.

26:19.693 --> 26:22.237
- Let's run in the fluids.
- I've got a femoral pulse.

26:22.404 --> 26:25.240
- Curved Kelly.
- Pressure's up. Sats, 82 and rising.

26:25.407 --> 26:26.992
Twenty-eight French.

26:29.702 --> 26:31.496
- Here, you want to sew this?
- Sure.

26:32.288 --> 26:33.331
Where you going?

26:33.414 --> 26:35.374
This guy's good. I've got other patients.

26:35.541 --> 26:38.043
- Dr. Pratt.
- I'll be back.

26:52.763 --> 26:54.431
- Hey, have you seen Pratt?
- Nope.

26:54.598 --> 26:56.809
- What about Kem?
- I haven't seen her either.

26:57.017 --> 27:01.646
Maybe they're together. You need to
keep better track of your woman, Carter.

27:05.441 --> 27:07.402
- Hey, Chuny. Have you seen Pratt?
- Sorry.

27:07.527 --> 27:10.279
- We have rules too, you know.
- What are you talking about?

27:10.446 --> 27:14.033
- What the hell's going on?
- The paramedics needed a translator.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.660
- You took her with you?
- She's persuasive.

27:16.827 --> 27:18.579
- She's febrile.
- She's also diabetic.

27:18.745 --> 27:21.748
Weak pulse and was already pretty
out of it when we found her.

27:26.377 --> 27:28.713
She was still talking when we found her.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.091
- I can't believe you would go out there.
- Temp, 40. 2. Accu-Chek, 252.

27:32.258 --> 27:36.261
A full set of labs. Pertussis PCR
and culture and blood culture.

27:36.428 --> 27:39.014
- Sounds good. How long's she had that?
- Several months.

27:39.181 --> 27:40.223
Several months.

27:40.307 --> 27:41.975
She said people in the building are sick.

27:42.100 --> 27:45.061
You exposed yourself to them?
Has she been coughing up anything?

27:45.186 --> 27:46.771
- Ectopy.
- Ma'am?

27:47.272 --> 27:49.774
Run in a liter wide open.
Get a 12-lead on her.

27:49.982 --> 27:51.442
BP's dropping, 92/56.

27:51.609 --> 27:53.569
Okay. She's septic and hypotensive.

27:53.736 --> 27:57.114
Let's mix up some dopamine,
titrate to a systolic of 90...

27:57.281 --> 27:59.991
...3.375 of Zosyn and 150 of gent.

28:00.117 --> 28:02.619
Pertussis is not a risk to my pregnancy.

28:02.786 --> 28:06.080
- It could be TB.
- What am I exposed to back home?

28:06.289 --> 28:10.501
Why don't you go ask Mrs. Lemonier if
her mother has any advance directives?

28:11.168 --> 28:12.920
You sure you two aren't married?

28:13.003 --> 28:15.756
Need a portable x-ray. Get him in! Pratt!

28:15.923 --> 28:18.467
- I need another set of hands.
- I got a nasty head lac.

28:18.634 --> 28:20.469
Get a med student to do it.

28:27.809 --> 28:31.270
You need to sit down
and roll up your sleeve, Louie.

28:31.437 --> 28:34.273
If you don't take your Epo shot,
you're gonna get sick again.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.317
Do you want to end up in the hosp-?
Hey, hey. Help! Security!

28:37.484 --> 28:40.487
Hey, Louie. Put her down,
or I'm gonna call your mother.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.448
- Now say you're sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry.

28:43.615 --> 28:46.784
- She didn't give me any gum.
- Well, that's no reason to pick her up.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.829
Here. Sit down and behave yourself.

28:50.037 --> 28:52.248
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:52.415 --> 28:56.794
Louie's a lifter. He likes to pick
things up, including nurses.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.713
You have to give him gum
before a shot.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.465
Now you tell me.

29:04.092 --> 29:06.761
Listen, about earlier,
I don't want you to get...

29:06.844 --> 29:09.138
the wrong idea about Luka.

29:09.347 --> 29:12.058
- He's a good guy.
- I'm not looking for anything right now.

29:12.224 --> 29:14.685
Okay. I just thought you should know.

29:14.852 --> 29:18.188
Thank you. But independence
works pretty good for me.

29:18.355 --> 29:20.357
Although I wouldn't mind
some regular sex.

29:20.565 --> 29:23.860
No kidding.
I'd settle for irregular sex.

29:24.027 --> 29:25.612
Can you help my husband?

29:25.778 --> 29:27.739
- What's the problem?
- It's my leg.

29:27.905 --> 29:30.992
- Did you fall?
- No, no. I think she shot me.

29:32.368 --> 29:34.954
Mom's sleeping off her bender.
She got about 30 stitches.

29:35.162 --> 29:38.081
Her head CT was negative.
Surgery wants to watch her overnight.

29:38.207 --> 29:41.251
BP's 110/78 after three liters.
And her crit's 41.

29:41.418 --> 29:43.545
Good.
If they discharge her in the morning...

29:43.712 --> 29:45.505
...why don't we keep the kid with her?

29:45.672 --> 29:49.550
DCFS won't let us do that.
They'll wanna place him into foster care.

29:50.176 --> 29:52.720
- It's only one night.
- Then we need to admit him.

29:52.887 --> 29:55.389
- What?
- He's looking a little dehydrated.

29:55.514 --> 29:59.351
Complaining of abdominal pain. Observe
him overnight for a rule-out appy.

29:59.893 --> 30:02.062
Look, if he was your kid?

30:03.146 --> 30:04.439
I'll start a chart.

30:08.026 --> 30:09.694
Hey, Rudy.

30:12.113 --> 30:17.075
I got good news. You and your mom can
spend the night at my hospital tonight.

30:17.493 --> 30:21.246
- You hungry? Anything I can get you?
- They took my gun.

30:23.123 --> 30:25.500
Police took your father's gun
because it's dangerous.

30:25.708 --> 30:27.502
You could hurt yourself
or somebody else.

30:27.669 --> 30:30.171
How am I gonna protect my mom?

30:32.673 --> 30:34.300
Look, buddy, your dad...

30:34.466 --> 30:36.760
...he's going to jail for what he did.

30:37.386 --> 30:40.013
Okay? You don't have
to be worried about him now.

30:40.347 --> 30:43.350
He'll get out. He always does.

30:43.516 --> 30:46.853
He turns off the lights
so I can't see him hitting my mom...

30:47.020 --> 30:49.147
...or find the phone.

30:49.313 --> 30:51.315
But I can always hear him.

30:51.649 --> 30:53.776
- Yo, Mike.
- Yeah, in a minute.

30:53.943 --> 30:55.694
We gotta roll, man.

30:57.821 --> 31:00.949
Look, I'll be back, okay? I promise.

31:01.116 --> 31:03.243
Everything'll be okay.

31:06.537 --> 31:10.291
No cardiac motion, no effusion
or tamponade. Resume CPR.

31:12.668 --> 31:15.713
- Zosyn is up. Another liter up.
- Another round of epi and atropine.

31:15.879 --> 31:17.381
Could be massive PE or Ml.

31:17.548 --> 31:20.842
Hypovolemia possible.
Hypoxia possible.

31:21.009 --> 31:25.054
No pneumo, hypothermia or tamponade.
All right. Holding CPR.

31:25.180 --> 31:28.307
- V-tach. I'll shock her.
- Charge to 360.

31:28.474 --> 31:30.017
Clear.

31:30.643 --> 31:32.353
V- fib. Clear.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.316
- She's flatline.
- Wanna pace her?

31:35.224 --> 31:38.101
You ran it. You call it.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.979
Time of death, 5:48.

31:45.066 --> 31:46.943
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

31:47.485 --> 31:50.654
Maybe if she'd come in two weeks
earlier, we could have...

31:52.531 --> 31:55.117
- You ran a good code.
- Didn't help her any.

31:58.995 --> 32:01.498
Carter, Abby needs you in here.

32:02.123 --> 32:04.167
Two liters in.
Pressure's up to 120 systolic.

32:04.375 --> 32:07.086
- Gram of Ancef. Update his tetanus.
- What's up?

32:07.295 --> 32:10.548
You tell me. GSW with no exit wound,
I can't find the bullet.

32:10.714 --> 32:12.675
Pelvic and chest films are clear.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.010
Maybe it migrated to the foot.

32:15.177 --> 32:17.387
I checked. But let's get
a foot and a tib-fib.

32:17.596 --> 32:20.223
- I didn't even want a gun in the house.
- Now I know why.

32:20.390 --> 32:22.433
It was an accident.
I didn't wanna use it.

32:22.642 --> 32:25.478
First HemoCue is 12.4.
Frequent PVCs on the monitor.

32:25.686 --> 32:27.271
Repeat the HemoCue in 30 minutes.

32:27.438 --> 32:30.441
- Sir, do you have any heart problems?
- No.

32:30.608 --> 32:33.986
- Do you use cocaine or crystal meth?
- No, no.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.032
Bullet's in the right ventricle.

32:39.199 --> 32:41.951
- Are you kidding me?
- What is it? Did you find it?

32:42.118 --> 32:47.039
Bullet traveled up your femoral vein into
the inferior vena cava into your heart.

32:47.915 --> 32:49.959
- What is that?
- Run of six, 100 of lidocaine.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.294
- Can you get it out?
- He'll need an operation.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.714
- On his heart?
- The bullet is irritating his heart. Right?

32:55.881 --> 32:59.426
Yeah. Let's page Corday
and Cardiothoracic just to be safe.

32:59.634 --> 33:02.720
And rebolus 50 of lido in five.
Help me roll him on his right side.

33:02.887 --> 33:04.847
- Will that help it to come out?
- No.

33:05.014 --> 33:07.600
That should keep the bullet
from entering his lungs.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.643
- Is that bad?
- Don't want that to happen.

33:09.810 --> 33:11.645
You put a bullet in my heart?

33:11.770 --> 33:14.106
I shot you in the leg. It was an accident.

33:14.273 --> 33:15.857
- You got this?
- Yep.

33:22.322 --> 33:27.326
- Paramedics ran over our ball.
- Yeah. Well, it happens.

33:28.494 --> 33:29.912
So seven is my record.

33:31.413 --> 33:33.499
- What?
- We lost seven patients in one shift...

33:33.665 --> 33:35.667
...my second year of residency.

33:35.876 --> 33:37.252
That supposed to cheer me up?

33:39.337 --> 33:43.299
You know, when you first got here,
you were...

33:43.466 --> 33:47.887
- ... dangerous, reckless and arrogant.
- Is this your idea of a pep talk?

33:48.637 --> 33:50.514
Hey, we all get our confidence rattled.

33:51.181 --> 33:54.059
If you don't, you should worry.
It means you've stopped caring.

33:54.268 --> 33:56.853
Believe me, you could do
a lot more harm playing it safe.

33:57.437 --> 33:59.564
So we're damned if we do,
damned if we don't.

33:59.856 --> 34:03.026
What do you want me to tell you?
That everything's gonna be okay?

34:03.192 --> 34:04.694
That you're gonna get so good...

34:04.819 --> 34:07.572
...that nothing bad
is ever gonna happen again? Forget it.

34:07.738 --> 34:11.199
This is what we do. If we're successful
in our jobs, then patients live.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.077
And if we're not...

34:13.659 --> 34:14.911
...sometimes they die.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.206
Or wind up paralyzed.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.377
Did you do
what you thought was best?

34:23.293 --> 34:26.088
Was there a chance
that you might have been right?

34:26.505 --> 34:28.966
Afterwards, did you tell the kid
what had happened?

34:29.925 --> 34:32.052
- Yeah.
- Then quit feeling sorry for yourself.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.721
You're a good doctor.
Start acting like it.

34:50.985 --> 34:52.237
Hey.

34:52.404 --> 34:54.072
How's the daughter?

34:54.614 --> 34:57.617
Better than I would be
if I'd just seen my mother die.

34:58.577 --> 35:01.287
- Are you angry with me?
- No.

35:01.496 --> 35:04.624
But I didn't expect you
to be doing paramedic ride-alongs.

35:04.791 --> 35:06.626
Did you even eat lunch today?

35:06.792 --> 35:09.003
- I'll grab something.
- You need to eat properly.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.589
- You treat the woman with pertussis?
- Yeah. Why?

35:11.755 --> 35:13.549
I think you'd better get out here.

35:14.091 --> 35:16.301
I don't know what they're saying.

35:16.468 --> 35:18.053
Who are "they"?

35:20.347 --> 35:23.474
They're Mrs. Lemonier's neighbors.
I told everyone in the building...

35:23.641 --> 35:26.185
...they needed to be examined,
possibly inoculated.

35:26.352 --> 35:27.937
You did?

35:28.104 --> 35:30.814
- Now you're angry.
- I'm not angry.

35:31.023 --> 35:34.568
Get everybody into Triage and round up
as much pertussis vaccine as you can.

35:34.735 --> 35:36.862
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.990
- I love you.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:40.323 --> 35:42.617
John, where's the man
with the bullet in his heart?

35:42.784 --> 35:44.202
- He's gone.
- What, he's dead?

35:44.369 --> 35:46.579
- No, no. They took him upstairs.
- Who?

35:46.871 --> 35:48.956
- Dr. Lawson.
- Who the hell is this Dr. Lawson?

35:49.123 --> 35:50.708
He's the new invasive radiologist.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.543
I was supposed to pick my daughter up.

35:52.626 --> 35:54.169
I stayed late because I was paged.

35:54.378 --> 35:56.213
He wanted to do it
so you didn't have to.

36:06.389 --> 36:08.099
What are you doing?

36:09.517 --> 36:12.978
- You must be Dr. Corday.
- That's right.

36:13.604 --> 36:16.148
Sorry. You got involved
in this case how?

36:16.315 --> 36:19.109
I was downstairs.
I saw his chest x-ray.

36:19.276 --> 36:22.153
Well, I was the consulting surgeon.

36:22.362 --> 36:24.989
This is the second patient of mine
you've poached today.

36:25.156 --> 36:26.532
Got it.

36:26.991 --> 36:29.910
Advancing the guide sheath
and moving south.

36:30.619 --> 36:34.164
If there are options in treatment,
we should present them to the patient...

36:34.331 --> 36:37.417
...so that he can hear the risks
and benefits of both procedures.

36:37.584 --> 36:39.628
I'm sorry. I thought you'd appreciate...

36:39.794 --> 36:42.005
...having two fewer procedures
to do today.

36:42.213 --> 36:46.092
The bullet's in the femoral vein.
You can have your patient back now.

36:47.134 --> 36:49.220
- What?
- You can take him to the OR.

36:49.428 --> 36:50.596
For a cutdown.

36:50.804 --> 36:52.681
It's nice to finally meet you,
Dr. Corday.

36:52.848 --> 36:54.808
I look forward
to working together again...

36:54.975 --> 36:56.643
...soon.

36:59.938 --> 37:01.398
Good night.

37:08.946 --> 37:10.865
- Hey, Dr. Pratt.
- Hey.

37:11.031 --> 37:14.034
Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
You saved my life.

37:14.201 --> 37:15.661
Not really.

37:15.869 --> 37:19.206
I came in here a few hours ago with
a broken back, and now I'm going home.

37:19.372 --> 37:21.666
You have a compression fracture
of your vertebrae.

37:21.833 --> 37:24.419
Yeah, I know. But I'm not paralyzed.

37:24.711 --> 37:27.797
Thank you. You're the best.

37:31.050 --> 37:32.843
Mom, can you hear me?

37:33.010 --> 37:34.553
Mom, wake up.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.847
- Mom.
- Hey, little man.

37:37.013 --> 37:40.475
- What's happening?
- My mom won't wake up.

37:41.184 --> 37:42.769
It's all my fault.

37:42.936 --> 37:46.564
No, it's not. The doctors just gave her
something so she could sleep.

37:48.482 --> 37:49.859
I couldn't protect her.

37:50.693 --> 37:52.861
- That's not your job.
- Yes, it is.

37:53.028 --> 37:55.155
She doesn't have anybody else
to do it.

37:56.990 --> 38:00.285
Well, it says here you do a great job
of taking care of your mom.

38:01.036 --> 38:02.912
Then why is she in the hospital?

38:05.540 --> 38:08.751
Well, you know, sometimes things
happen that we have no control of.

38:08.918 --> 38:12.046
Bad things.
Even when we do our best.

38:13.213 --> 38:17.634
But I think your mom's lucky to have
somebody like you looking out for her.

38:26.184 --> 38:29.061
Your arm may hurt
and may feel a little achy.

38:32.439 --> 38:33.774
But it'll pass.

38:35.609 --> 38:37.944
If it doesn't, you need
to come back to the hospital.

38:39.654 --> 38:41.239
- Hey, Luka, you busy?
- No.

38:41.489 --> 38:43.199
You mind helping me
examine patients?

38:43.366 --> 38:45.368
They all may have been exposed
to pertussis.

38:45.535 --> 38:47.328
- Why not.
- You don't mind?

38:47.536 --> 38:49.622
No. This at least I'm good at.

38:49.747 --> 38:52.916
- Hey, Kem enjoyed your lecture.
- Yeah, she's the only one.

38:53.042 --> 38:56.503
I don't think I got through to any
of the others. Maybe it's the accent.

38:56.753 --> 38:58.630
What the hell is this?

38:58.797 --> 39:01.049
These people may be infected
with whooping cough.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.801
Then they should be seeing
their primary-care physician.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.846
From what I've seen,
you are their primary-care physician.

39:07.054 --> 39:09.056
- Kem.
- If you don't give them medical care...

39:09.223 --> 39:12.518
...they won't seek treatment, and you'll
have an epidemic on your hands.

39:12.685 --> 39:16.104
- What Kem is trying to say is-
- She doesn't need you interpreting.

39:16.271 --> 39:20.108
She's making herself perfectly clear.
You got your work cut out for you.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.736
All right, do it, but do it quickly.
From now on, no one is going to Africa.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.572
I'm tired
of this Dr. Schweitzer routine.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.908
- Did I say something wrong?
- Not at all.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.952
Eighteen-year-old Peter Spratt,
took a hockey puck to the face.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.913
Looks like a mandible fracture.
He swallowed teeth and blood.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.290
- Okay, I got this.
- He's not moving enough air.

39:37.457 --> 39:40.919
- His jaw is too busted to intubate.
- Let's get a 7-0 ET tube and Surgilube.

39:41.086 --> 39:42.670
- I'm going nasal.
- Pratt?

39:42.837 --> 39:44.547
It's okay. Dr. Kovac showed me.

39:44.714 --> 39:47.049
Tachy at 112,
sats are 92 and dropping.

39:47.216 --> 39:49.969
Apparently, somebody's
been listening to you.

39:51.637 --> 39:53.055
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

39:53.222 --> 39:55.515
No worries.
They're just watching a movie.

39:55.807 --> 39:57.517
Hi, Ella.

39:57.726 --> 40:00.070
Okay, time to go. Put your shoes on.

40:00.253 --> 40:01.438
It's almost over.

40:01.604 --> 40:04.440
- How are the puppies?
- Messy. But the kids had fun.

40:04.607 --> 40:07.109
- You want a piece of cake?
- No. I haven't had dinner.

40:07.276 --> 40:10.905
In that case, how about a slice of pizza?
I'll even throw in a glass of wine.

40:11.071 --> 40:12.406
All right, then.

40:12.573 --> 40:15.784
So how was your pancake-juju thing?

40:15.993 --> 40:17.744
- My what?
- Your surgery.

40:17.911 --> 40:19.829
The operation you were
doing this morning.

40:19.996 --> 40:22.749
Pancreaticojejunostomy?

40:23.082 --> 40:25.168
- You made that up, didn't you?
- Nope.

40:25.334 --> 40:28.587
Come on, admit it. You have
the perfect job for getting out of things.

40:28.754 --> 40:31.340
Who's gonna argue with
a surgeon? "I'm really sorry.

40:31.507 --> 40:32.883
I'd love to help you move,

40:32.966 --> 40:35.093
...but I have to separate
a pair of Guatemalan twins...

40:35.260 --> 40:37.095
...who are joined at the testes. "

40:37.512 --> 40:39.556
Actually, a pancreaticojejunostomy

40:39.639 --> 40:42.183
is a replumbing of the upper GI tract.

40:42.350 --> 40:45.144
That sounds painful.
Can you get that from working out?

40:45.311 --> 40:48.773
- Because my shoulder's been killing me.
- I believe that's called old age.

40:50.274 --> 40:53.152
After I go to all the trouble
of making you this nice dinner.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.404
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:55.696 --> 40:57.656
Happy birthday.

41:01.242 --> 41:02.911
Hey, Rudy.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.496
- How you doing, man?
- Okay.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.914
You hungry?

41:07.456 --> 41:09.542
I went and picked us up some burgers...

41:09.625 --> 41:13.337
...and French fries because I am starving.

41:13.796 --> 41:15.839
I also got you this.

41:18.842 --> 41:20.427
All right, take it.

41:21.594 --> 41:24.514
So you don't ever have to worry
about the lights going out.

41:45.366 --> 41:46.909
- Busy.
- No kidding.

41:47.618 --> 41:50.204
- How was your day?
- It sucked. Yours?

41:50.371 --> 41:51.872
Same.

41:54.416 --> 41:56.251
About this morning-

41:56.418 --> 41:57.961
- Forget it.
- No.

41:58.128 --> 42:00.130
I know sometimes
I can be overzealous.

42:00.755 --> 42:04.759
- Is that-? Is that the word?
- Don't know. Is that Croatian for "jerk"?

42:05.927 --> 42:10.181
I'm sorry. I didn't want to take
my frustrations out on you.

42:10.472 --> 42:14.184
Sometimes I just feel very passionate.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.200
John!

42:34.786 --> 42:36.580
- Want a bite?
- No. What are you doing?

42:36.747 --> 42:39.666
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- We are. I'm just famished.

42:39.833 --> 42:43.002
- I needed something to hold me over.
- All this?

42:43.419 --> 42:45.922
I couldn't decide.
There was too much to choose from.

42:46.130 --> 42:50.342
- I got Twinkies, Ho Hos, MoonPies.
- This is all junk food.

42:50.509 --> 42:53.220
I know. But it tastes so good.

42:53.554 --> 42:58.975
I must be getting cravings. All I can
think about is chocolate. And sex.

42:59.392 --> 43:03.187
- But I am so happy. Are you happy?
- Yeah.

43:05.523 --> 43:07.942
Thanks for letting me
come to the hospital today.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.777
I love to watch you work.

43:09.944 --> 43:13.030
- You were such a stud.
- Oh, stop it.

43:13.238 --> 43:15.324
It's all I could do
to keep my hands off you.

43:15.490 --> 43:19.536
- That's it. No more sugar for you.
- Can I come tomorrow?

43:19.703 --> 43:21.996
- No.
- Why not?

43:22.163 --> 43:24.957
Because Dr. Weaver said
she'd fire me if you did.

43:25.124 --> 43:27.710
- She didn't?
- Actually, she did. Yeah.

43:28.961 --> 43:31.505
- I should talk to her.
- No, please don't. No.

43:31.672 --> 43:34.633
What, did I do something wrong?
Did I get in the way?

43:34.800 --> 43:36.944
Did I ask too many questions?
I asked too many questions.

43:37.011 --> 43:40.680
- Did I ask too many questions?
- How many chocolate bars did you eat?
