01:55.491 --> 01:58.451

on your neck a little while longer.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.161
TYRlON: l'm sorry, what am l grateful for?

02:00.245 --> 02:04.207
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall
as punishment for a crime l did not commit?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.417
You threw your life away.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.628
lt's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

02:08.712 --> 02:11.881
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.640
l couldn't listen to her
standing there, telling her lies.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.517
l couldn't do it.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.977
You fell in love with a whore.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.605
Yes.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.608
And l was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.115
That deal you made,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.992
it was everything Father wanted.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.830
You do see that? He gets you back as his heir.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.998
The future Lord of the Rock.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.752
And he ships me off to Castle Black,
out of sight at last.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.172
All so perfect.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.344
lt felt good to take that from him.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.850
He knows l'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.059
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.143
Not you.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.480
You're the golden son.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.649
You could kill a king, lose a hand,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.901

you'll always be the golden son.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.236

03:15.988 --> 03:18.281

At least l got to tell them what they really are.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.956
Yes, brilliant speech.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.542
They'll be talking about it for days to come.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.878
l thought you were a realist.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.797
Didn't realise you'd die for pride.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.091
Don't give up on me just yet.

03:37.968 --> 03:42.013
l survived one trial by combat,
even though you weren't there to save me.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.265
l can't save you this time either.

03:45.976 --> 03:50.563
My training has proved that
l can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.650
Where's your sense of adventure?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.738

16:16.559 --> 16:18.894
you'd have your britches down
and your cock out before l could blink.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.562
Does he frighten you so much?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.939
l'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.317
He's freakish big and strong.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.486
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.239
Maybe l could take him,

16:31.908 --> 16:34.326
dance around
until he's so tired of hacking at me,

16:34.410 --> 16:37.663
he dropped his sword,
get him off his feet somehow.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.831
But one misstep

16:39.916 --> 16:41.375
and l'm dead.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.877
Why should l risk it?

16:44.587 --> 16:45.921
Because you're my friend.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.964
Aye, l'm your friend.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.301
And when have you ever risked your life
for me?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.313
l like you,

17:03.398 --> 17:05.565
pampered little shit that you are.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.025
l just like myself more.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.944
l understand.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.529
l'm sorry it has to be this way.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.280
Why are you sorry?

17:13.282 --> 17:16.284
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

17:16.911 --> 17:20.122
That's what l liked about you in the first place.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.587
We had some good days together.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.297
Yes, we did.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.228
(BANGS ON DOOR)

17:44.522 --> 17:45.605
What will you do?

17:45.690 --> 17:49.067
l suppose l'll have to kill the Mountain myself.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.655
Won't that make for a great song?

17:56.951 --> 17:59.494
l hope to hear them sing it one day.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.255
(BlRD SCREECHlNG)

18:17.513 --> 18:18.847
How did you get in here?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.515
Your door is well guarded,

18:20.808 --> 18:22.476
but your window is not.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.068
l swam to an island a mile offshore for these.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.113
Don't do that again.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.201
Never met a woman
who didn't like wildflowers.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.119
These are my private quarters.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.538
lf l want you here, l will summon you.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.959
Forgive me, my queen. l live to serve you.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.551
Tell me why you're here.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.389
l came to ask a favour.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.477
l only have two talents in this world.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.062
War and women.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.817
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.
That is a wise decision. l respect it.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.069
But here in Meereen,
l cannot pursue my talents.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.697
l've ordered the Second Sons to
patrol the streets to stop the revenge killings.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.324
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.743
And as for women,

19:21.828 --> 19:25.163
there are thousands in Meereen
you can pursue.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.958
There is only one,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.502
and she does not want me.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.547
You swore me your sword.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.007
My sword is yours till the day l die.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.719
So if l command you to stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets?

19:39.929 --> 19:42.722
l'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.225
Send me to kill your enemies.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.269
Any enemy anywhere.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.856
Let me do what l do best.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.109
Very well.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.325
Do what you do best.

Oh.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.497
Come in, my queen. Please.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.416
l didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.792
You could never.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.961
l just wanted to speak with you before we left.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.505
Could you bring me that vial over there?

21:01.344 --> 21:02.385
The blue one.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.015
No, not that one.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.392
You don't even want to touch that one.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.019

That's the one.

(lNHALES)

21:32.541 --> 21:36.628
When l looked into the flames this morning,
the Lord spoke to me.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.838
He said,

21:38.923 --> 21:43.843
"Tonight, you will have your last good bath
in a long while.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.553
"Make it count."

21:49.141 --> 21:51.017
-A joke.
-(CHUCKLES LlGHTLY)

21:52.019 --> 21:53.645
Not a very good one, l'm afraid.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.771
lt was. l...

21:56.065 --> 21:58.358
Humour isn't my strength.

21:58.442 --> 22:02.529
That's because most jokes are lies
and you're devoted to the truth.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.949
lf they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.701
Not always.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.714
Most of these powders and potions

22:20.798 --> 22:21.798
are lies.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.927
Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.

22:26.762 --> 22:30.348
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was,

22:30.433 --> 22:32.934
a trick that led them to the truth.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.520
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire

22:35.604 --> 22:39.149
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.152
And this one creates a black smoke

22:42.236 --> 22:44.446
that will make the bravest man
piss himself with fear.

22:45.197 --> 22:49.951
And a drop of this in any man's wine
will drive him wild with lust.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.707
Did you use it with Stannis?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.833
No.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.838
Don't be upset.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.299
Men never crave what they already have.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.635
lt's only flesh.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.056
lt needs what it needs.

23:14.643 --> 23:19.689
No act done in service of the Lord
can ever be called a sin.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.069
l thank God every day for bringing you to us.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.904
And Stannis to you.

23:26.781 --> 23:30.366
He wants to bring Shireen with us.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.496
l think that would be ill-advised.

23:35.498 --> 23:39.334
My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.712
l don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

23:42.797 --> 23:45.882
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.014
l understand how you feel.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.184
But that is impossible.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.396
Why?

24:02.358 --> 24:05.485
You don't need powders and potions,
my queen.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.946
You don't need lies.

24:08.030 --> 24:12.909
You are strong enough to look into
the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.959
However harsh it is.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.461
However hard for us to understand.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.049
You don't need my help,
but l will need yours soon.

24:29.343 --> 24:32.428
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.934
The Lord needs her.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.861
Jorah the Andal.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.573
Are you here to see our queen?

24:53.242 --> 24:55.034
She's in a good mood.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.759
Khaleesi.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.970
-You're here early.
-Later than some.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.184
-You don't approve?
-lt's not a question of approval,

25:19.268 --> 25:20.768
it's a question of trust.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.520
You neither approve nor trust.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.397
Why would l? The man's a sellsword.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.984
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company
before pledging your sword to my brother?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.569
l did.

25:29.653 --> 25:30.778
l trust you.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.364
Daario Naharis killed his captains

25:33.449 --> 25:36.701
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.703
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

25:38.787 --> 25:42.123
l could never have faith in a man like Daario.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.294
That's why l've sent him and the Second Sons
to retake Yunkai.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.840
-You have?
-l have.

25:50.925 --> 25:52.884
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

25:52.968 --> 25:55.220
l fear the masters will simply bide their time,

25:55.304 --> 25:57.555
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.392
That is why l've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.688
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.149
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.652
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.696
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

26:13.781 --> 26:17.158
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

26:17.243 --> 26:19.327
is also treating men like beasts.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.748
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.208
lf you want them to know something else,

26:25.626 --> 26:27.085
you'll have to show it to them.

26:27.169 --> 26:30.922
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
A fine? A stern warning?

26:31.006 --> 26:33.758
lt's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

26:33.842 --> 26:36.469
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.222
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.015
Slavery is real.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.934
l can end it. l will end it,

26:43.018 --> 26:45.395
and those behind it.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.939
l sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

26:48.023 --> 26:53.236
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.738
l wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

26:55.823 --> 26:58.574
what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.207
The man who came to me the other day
about burying his father.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.668
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

27:09.712 --> 27:13.464
He will accompany the Second Sons
and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.301
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.887
He will explain
the choice they have before them.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.767
They can live in my new world
or they can die in their old one.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.774
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.234
Tell him l changed my mind.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.903
Yes, Khaleesi.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.452
No.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.624
Tell him you changed my mind.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.888
HOUND: (GRUNTS) Rat cunts.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.100
Fucking whore.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.103
You're doing it wrong.

28:10.314 --> 28:12.565
You need to burn away that horrible bit there.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.109
Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.281
l know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

28:20.366 --> 28:22.075
No fire.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.994
lt'll only take a second.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.206
-lt won't hurt that much.
-No fire!

28:42.721 --> 28:44.597
Shut up about it.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.811
About everything.

28:49.895 --> 28:54.524
Thanks to you, l'm a walking bag of silver
anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.820
Which is everywhere between
where we are now and where we're going.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.660
l'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

29:06.036 --> 29:10.081
getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.877
No reward is worth this much trouble.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.797
Wish l'd never laid eyes on you.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.768
You say your brother gave you that sword.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.356
My brother gave me this.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.527
lt was just like you said a while back.

29:40.362 --> 29:44.365
Pressed me to the fire like
l was a nice juicy mutton chop.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.245
Why?

29:49.329 --> 29:51.205
Thought l stole one of his toys.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.541
l didn't steal it. l was just playing with it.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.590
The pain was bad.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.425
The smell was worse.

30:06.430 --> 30:10.433
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.190
My father, who protected him,

30:19.401 --> 30:21.903
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.959
You think you're on your own?

30:39.922 --> 30:43.633
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.620
BRlENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.081
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

31:15.165 --> 31:18.167
l think we can treat ourselves to
a featherbed for the night

31:18.252 --> 31:20.503
and a hot meal not cooked by you.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.879
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

31:21.964 --> 31:24.340
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.634
-Not working for your former lord any longer.
-Yes, my lady.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.136
Don't get drunk.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.556
No, my lady.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.974
HOT PlE: Can l get you anything else?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.850
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.310
Kidney pie is wonderful.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.312
Thanks.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.523
l do my best.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.485
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.822
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.740
Easy enough. But the meat,

31:49.825 --> 31:52.577
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

31:52.661 --> 31:54.287
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.081
l mean,
some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.792
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.628
Don't get me started on the gravy.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.130
Very difficult to get right.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.965
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.175
You cannot give up.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.719
No gravy, no pie.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.554
Simple as that.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.641
That's nice armour. Are you a knight?

32:17.686 --> 32:19.186
No.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.398
Oh, it's just people with armour
are usually knights.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.026
Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.945
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.197
What brings you to these parts?

32:30.741 --> 32:31.741
We're looking for someone.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.285
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.621
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 1 7...

32:36.705 --> 32:38.789
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.043
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.295
Starks?

32:47.674 --> 32:49.842
What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

32:53.722 --> 32:55.848
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.391
l heard they was all traitors.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.810
Don't need no traitors in here.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.147
l pledged my life to their mother
Catelyn Stark.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.232
l swore to her l'd bring her daughters home.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.698
Sure l can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

33:27.089 --> 33:29.256
-What?
-lt's nothing, my lady.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.718
You wouldn't be screwing your face up
like that if it was nothing.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.970
Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, l don't.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.764
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.602
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.646
The Lannisters have money.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.690
People kill for money.

33:47.109 --> 33:50.111
l don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.040
My lady. My lord. Could l have a word?

34:03.125 --> 34:06.627
-What about? Not kidney pie.
-You seem like a proper lady.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.838
Someone who could be trusted.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.967
l never met no Sansa Stark.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.261
But l know her sister.

34:15.971 --> 34:16.971
Arya.

34:20.016 --> 34:23.352
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

34:23.437 --> 34:25.229
She's presumed dead.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.606
She weren't when l last spoke to her.

34:27.691 --> 34:30.192
-When was that?
-Heading up north with the Night's Watch.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.944
She was all dressed up as a boy.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.530
Like your ladyship, only without the armour.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.490
Going by the name Arry.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.200
-So what happened to her?
-Well...

34:38.285 --> 34:39.493
The quick version.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.621
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.915
We escaped.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.960
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.839
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother
at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

34:51.923 --> 34:55.760
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.720
-Not friendly.
-The Hound.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.097
That's the one.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.434
lf you find her, could you give her this?

35:03.518 --> 35:07.062
She liked the last one l gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.199
Um...

35:18.283 --> 35:20.201
You were saying?

35:23.705 --> 35:26.457
BRlENNE: Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,

35:26.541 --> 35:28.959
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.503
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.421
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.632
Why the Eyrie?

35:34.716 --> 35:36.717
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.470
Catelyn Stark's sister.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.723
She's Arya's last living relative with money.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.059
She hates the Lannisters.

35:47.187 --> 35:50.064
Lord Tyrion made sure
l knew which house married which

35:50.148 --> 35:52.066
and who hated who.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.819
BRlENNE: Sansa could be there, too.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.905
PODRlCK: Could be.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.330
You sure about this?

36:09.709 --> 36:11.252
No.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.229
(DOOR OPENS)

36:42.492 --> 36:45.452
l imagined
you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

36:45.537 --> 36:50.040
l did spend some time with
an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.586
Mmm. Do tell.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.840
l've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind l like.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.842
Your sister.

37:00.969 --> 37:01.969
Oh.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.978
Cersei approached me.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.148
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.318
How worried your sister is about her.

37:17.736 --> 37:21.989
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.700
l think she may have even believed it herself.

37:24.784 --> 37:29.997
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.000
lt was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.589
lt is rare to meet a Lannister

37:38.673 --> 37:42.509
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.597
She desperately wants to see you killed.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.558
She didn't need to bother you.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.645
lt looks as though
l've taken care of that myself.

37:52.979 --> 37:57.775
The joy she will feel when
my head leaves my neck.

37:58.068 --> 38:01.028
She's wanted this for a long time.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.948
Yes, l know.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.951
We met, you and l.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.661
Many years ago.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.622
l think l would have remembered that.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.000
Unlikely. You had just been born.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.715
Our father brought me and my sister Elia
with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.884
My first time away from Dorne.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.136
l didn't like anything about the Rock.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.392
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.977
Nothing.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.231
But the biggest disappointment,

38:37.941 --> 38:39.233
you.

38:41.277 --> 38:44.405
You and my family have more in common
than you might admit.

38:44.489 --> 38:48.450
The whole way from Dorne
all anyone talked about was

38:48.535 --> 38:52.579
the monster that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.541
A head twice the size of his body,

38:55.625 --> 38:57.334
a tail between his legs,

38:57.419 --> 38:59.545
claws, one red eye,

38:59.879 --> 39:02.506
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.842
That would have made things so much easier.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.262
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.433
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "Soon."

39:13.685 --> 39:16.353
Then she and your brother

39:16.438 --> 39:17.896
took us to your nursery and...

39:20.400 --> 39:23.610
...she unveiled the freak.

39:25.780 --> 39:29.533
Your head was a bit large,
your arms and legs were a bit small,

39:29.617 --> 39:31.869
but no claw.

39:31.953 --> 39:34.455
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.124
Just a tiny pink cock.

39:37.459 --> 39:42.254
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," l told Cersei.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.507
"That's just a baby."

39:47.010 --> 39:49.720
And she said, "He killed my mother."

39:49.804 --> 39:54.058
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
l thought she might pull it off.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.185
Until your brother made her stop.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.687
"lt doesn't matter," she told us.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.898
"Everyone says he will die soon.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.816
"l hope they are right.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.360
"He should not have lived this long."

40:09.324 --> 40:10.866
Well, (SNlFFLES)

40:13.661 --> 40:18.165
sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.754
And what about what l want?

40:25.590 --> 40:27.674
Justice

40:28.384 --> 40:31.303
for my sister and her children.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.430
lf you want justice,

40:33.515 --> 40:36.266
you've come to the wrong place.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.477
l disagree.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.862
l've come to the perfect place.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.117
l want to bring those who have wronged me
to justice.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.078
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.999
l will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,

41:01.501 --> 41:03.627
who killed my sister's children

41:03.711 --> 41:07.089
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

41:07.173 --> 41:09.883
before killing her, too.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.602
l will be your champion.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.480
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

42:15.200 --> 42:16.950
Hello, Robin.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.204
What are you doing?

42:20.496 --> 42:23.248
l'm building my home, Winterfell.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.336
At least l think l am.
l haven't been back there in a very long time.

42:28.421 --> 42:29.755
Why did you leave?

42:30.006 --> 42:32.299
lt's a long story.

42:33.635 --> 42:34.801
l stay here in the Eyrie.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.888
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and l have to keep myself safe

42:37.972 --> 42:39.723
because l'm the Lord of the Vale

42:39.807 --> 42:42.142
and a very important person.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.478
Yes, you certainly are.

42:45.438 --> 42:46.813
When will you go back?

42:48.191 --> 42:49.775
Probably never.

42:49.859 --> 42:53.946
My family doesn't live there any more
and someone burned it down.

42:55.823 --> 42:56.823
Oh.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.160
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

43:00.245 --> 43:01.620
No, l'm afraid not.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.747
lt's not high up in the mountains.
lt's down on the ground.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.916
-That sounds dangerous.
-(CHUCKLES)

43:06.000 --> 43:08.418
-How do you make people fly?
-We don't.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.003
What do you do with all the bad people

43:10.088 --> 43:12.506
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

43:12.590 --> 43:14.549
l never did anything with them at all.

43:14.634 --> 43:16.760
Girls didn't take part in that
where l came from.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.138
Well, l'm Lord of the Vale.

43:20.223 --> 43:23.725
When l grow up,
l'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.769
Or you. When we get married,

43:25.853 --> 43:27.771
you can tell me if you don't like somebody

43:27.855 --> 43:29.898
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

43:29.983 --> 43:31.608
Right through the Moon Door.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.279
l like the sound of that.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.072
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

43:37.323 --> 43:38.448
All right.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.743
-lt can go in here in this big tower.
-Be careful.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.288
You've ruined it. Now l'm going to have to
rebuild the whole thing.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.706
-l didn't ruin it.
-You did.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.708
lt was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

43:47.792 --> 43:50.460
-l was fixing it.
-Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.087
-lt's ruining them.
-l didn't ruin it!

43:52.171 --> 43:54.172
-You're being stupid.
-l didn't ruin it!

-l hit him.
-Yes, l saw.

-l shouldn't have done that.
-No.

44:19.991 --> 44:22.784
His mother should have, a long time ago.

Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

what everything looked like.

first you must demolish the old one.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.526
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

45:01.199 --> 45:02.866
Tell me why.

45:07.747 --> 45:11.124
l loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

45:14.837 --> 45:18.131
what do we do to

overcome strength and duty,

45:35.942 --> 45:38.276

Come here, Sansa.

No.

Neither do l, precisely.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.400
Hundreds of feet.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.652
lt's fascinating

47:02.737 --> 47:06.281
what happens to bodies when
they hit the rocks from such a height.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.575
The impact breaks them right apart.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.870
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.372
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

47:14.749 --> 47:17.334

-l didn't. You don't understand.
-l saw you.

because l saw it with my own eyes.
