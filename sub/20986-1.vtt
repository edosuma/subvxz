01:52.445 --> 01:55.846
"Star light, star bright.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.681
"First star I see tonight.

01:57.683 --> 02:00.116
"I wish I may, I wish I might.

02:00.118 --> 02:02.785
"Have the wish I wish tonight."

02:02.787 --> 02:04.953
Dear, God, please, please,

02:04.955 --> 02:09.958
I wish for there to be a circus in
my backyard tomorrow afternoon,

02:09.960 --> 02:11.626
when I come home from school.

02:11.628 --> 02:13.861
Not a fake circus,
a real circus,

02:13.863 --> 02:17.064
with clowns and acrobats
and everything.

02:17.066 --> 02:19.533
If you do this,
I'll tell everybody.

02:19.535 --> 02:23.069
You'll be on television and
you'll be in the newspapers.

02:23.071 --> 02:25.204
And you'll get
more money for church.

02:25.206 --> 02:28.974
Please, God, please.
Make this come true.

02:34.281 --> 02:37.749
All right now, children,
I want you to tear a page

02:37.751 --> 02:38.583
neatly out of your notebooks,

02:38.585 --> 02:42.353
and copy the address down just as
Bobbie's writing it here on the board.

02:42.355 --> 02:45.055
All right? Oh, isn't
this exciting?

02:45.057 --> 02:47.991
How many children have
relatives in the circus?

02:47.993 --> 02:50.493
I bet your regular teacher
wishes she was here today.

02:50.495 --> 02:56.065
And there's gonna be clowns, a
trapeze and horses and everything.

02:56.067 --> 03:00.135
All in your backyard. Hmph!
Isn't that thrilling?

03:00.137 --> 03:03.204
Yeah. And everybody
from school gets in free.

03:03.206 --> 03:04.338
Oh, that's nice.

03:04.340 --> 03:08.141
Now, children, I want you to be sure
and write down the time, all right?

03:08.143 --> 03:10.710
It's 3:30. Can you write that?

03:19.019 --> 03:21.052
Hey, hey, son!

03:32.731 --> 03:35.331
Are we going to see
the surprise?

03:47.978 --> 03:49.877
What is this circus?

03:49.879 --> 03:53.146
Where is the circus?
I don't know.

03:53.148 --> 03:58.251
But it was supposed to be here.
It was supposed to come.

04:46.868 --> 04:50.135
Hi. My name is Bob...

04:50.137 --> 04:51.736
Oh, shit.

04:59.878 --> 05:01.410
Hmm.

05:02.279 --> 05:04.212
Okay.

05:04.714 --> 05:07.347
Hi. My name is Bob Jones.

05:07.349 --> 05:12.151
I was born in Detroit,
Michigan in 19... Damn!

05:16.524 --> 05:18.056
Okay.

05:18.058 --> 05:20.691
My, uh, my name...

05:22.461 --> 05:24.394
I am, uh...

05:24.596 --> 05:27.396
Bob Jones. Robert Jones.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.433
Formerly Bobbie Jones.

05:31.435 --> 05:33.234
Formerly,

05:33.869 --> 05:37.804
Bobbie Ivanovich, actually.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.772
I am, uh...

05:39.774 --> 05:44.943
Those are my... This... That's who...
Oh, I hate this.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.711
Okay, look. I'm just
gonna do this, okay?

05:46.713 --> 05:53.117
Sorry if it doesn't all make sense, but, uh,
I may not have a lot of time here, so...

05:53.319 --> 05:55.252
The fact is,

05:55.687 --> 05:57.787
I'm supposed to be dying.

05:58.122 --> 05:59.421
Um, I've got a disease
called cancer.

05:59.423 --> 06:00.889
There are a lot of
different kinds of cancer.

06:00.891 --> 06:03.224
Mine started in my kidneys,
spread to my lungs.

06:03.226 --> 06:04.692
Now, I have a doctor,
nice enough guy,

06:04.694 --> 06:09.763
says, uh, we're gonna try all
kinds of experimental therapies.

06:09.765 --> 06:12.365
But the truth is he really
doesn't think I'm gonna make it.

06:12.367 --> 06:18.637
I plan to prove him wrong. Now the
tricky part here is not that, uh,

06:18.639 --> 06:22.974
I'm supposed to be dying,
but that, uh,

06:23.409 --> 06:25.308
you're about to be born.

06:25.310 --> 06:28.511
Okay? Here are some facts.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.446
We all die.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.948
Not pleasant, but we do.
It happens.

06:32.950 --> 06:34.549
I could get hit
by a truck tomorrow.

06:34.551 --> 06:36.350
Hopefully not a large truck.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.719
I could, uh, be sleeping,

06:38.721 --> 06:42.222
palm tree crashes through
the bedroom ceiling, kills me.

06:42.224 --> 06:42.889
It's over. Could happen.

06:42.891 --> 06:45.558
If something like that did happen,
it would really be a drag

06:45.560 --> 06:51.163
because there are a lot of things
I wanna tell you and say to you.

06:51.965 --> 06:53.764
Uh...

06:54.399 --> 06:59.702
There's not a lot you can trust in this world.
There just isn't.

07:00.037 --> 07:04.339
So I wanted to leave
you this videotape,

07:04.341 --> 07:07.909
for better
or for worse, so that

07:07.911 --> 07:12.580
you know something
about me, who I am.

07:13.816 --> 07:15.115
Well, this is me.

07:15.117 --> 07:20.587
Came into the world weighing 8
pounds, 9 ounces, 21 inches tall.

07:20.589 --> 07:23.489
Eyes, blue. Hair, none.

07:23.491 --> 07:26.925
Uh, let's... Look at this.

07:27.894 --> 07:29.693
Oh, my goodness.

07:30.829 --> 07:32.261
Look at this.

07:32.263 --> 07:35.864
It's amazing.
How is that possible?

07:35.866 --> 07:39.934
Who the heck is this guy? He looks
like a loose kind of guy, doesn't he?

07:39.936 --> 07:44.505
One of the members of the family who just
got out of a mental institution, I think.

07:44.507 --> 07:48.475
Mmm, look at this. Looks
like the meat packers union.

07:48.977 --> 07:52.311
None of these people will ever
become a member of a dance troupe.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.879
You can bet on that.

07:53.881 --> 07:57.082
Oh. Here's a picture
of me and my mom, Rose.

07:57.084 --> 08:00.318
She said there were 12 tornadoes
in Detroit the day I was born.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.154
Twelve tornadoes.
Four people died.

08:03.156 --> 08:07.158
She always said
I was a natural disaster.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.461
Oh, here you go. This is my dad.
Take note of that.

08:10.463 --> 08:15.799
It's one of the few pictures
you'll see of my dad awake.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.266
See what I mean? Look there.

08:17.268 --> 08:22.170
To get my dad off the couch, you had
to say the sale light was on at Kmart.

08:24.440 --> 08:29.843
Okay. These primitive
life forms you see here

08:29.845 --> 08:34.013
are, uh, your relatives, actually,
grazing and foraging in Detroit.

08:34.015 --> 08:39.251
They still live there, so the chance
of you seeing them are pretty slim.

08:39.253 --> 08:42.621
I think it's important for you
to see this so that you realize,

08:42.623 --> 08:47.058
you know, who you are isn't
necessarily all your fault.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.926
You can blame it
on the gene pool.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.994
Here's your grandfather
lightin' up a smoke.

08:50.996 --> 08:55.965
Oh, there's me and your Uncle
Paul, my brother and your uncle.

08:56.968 --> 08:58.334
As you can tell
from these movies,

08:58.336 --> 09:02.905
the chances of a Nike contract
in your future are slim.

09:02.907 --> 09:04.606
Sorry.

09:04.841 --> 09:07.975
Oh, my Uncle Marco used to
pack us in his station wagon,

09:07.977 --> 09:09.142
take us all these places.

09:09.144 --> 09:11.544
And, uh, we used to go to this
place, this amusement park.

09:11.546 --> 09:14.580
That was called the Screamer,
right there, that roller coaster.

09:14.582 --> 09:16.481
And my Uncle Marco
thought it was a good idea

09:16.483 --> 09:20.685
to put me on this thing and said
I was gonna have a lot of fun.

09:20.687 --> 09:24.388
Stupidest thing I ever did.
Thought I was gonna die.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.457
That's where I first learned
the meaning of the word fear.

09:27.459 --> 09:31.127
First and last roller coaster ride
you're lookin' at right there.

09:31.129 --> 09:35.564
Here's another shot of your Uncle Paul.
He used to be a schoolteacher, Paul.

09:35.566 --> 09:40.368
Taught social studies. Now he
works for my dad, junk dealer.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.803
We don't talk too much anymore.
I hate these things.

09:42.805 --> 09:47.040
I hate other people's home movies.
I hate my own home movies.

09:47.809 --> 09:50.643
And I always did.

10:02.490 --> 10:04.857
Eleanor called today.

10:05.259 --> 10:08.827
She wanted to know if I'd be
treasurer again this year.

10:10.564 --> 10:11.596
What'd you say?

10:11.598 --> 10:17.535
What could I say? "I can't. I'm going
fishing for the next 150 years."

10:18.437 --> 10:20.303
Very funny.

10:20.305 --> 10:25.308
You know, it's something we're
gonna have to tell people.

10:25.410 --> 10:30.012
Yeah. Don't forget to tell
me when that is, okay?

10:31.315 --> 10:33.615
Amazing, isn't it?

10:33.783 --> 10:37.718
There's just no appropriate
etiquette for this.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.255
Yeah, you'd think Hallmark would
have come up with something by now.

10:42.257 --> 10:46.392
You know, "Due to an
unexpected terminal illness,

10:46.394 --> 10:49.762
"Bob Jones regrets
to inform you..."

10:50.097 --> 10:52.664
Or you can leave it
on your answering machine.

10:52.666 --> 10:54.832
"Hi, this is Bob Jones.
I'm dead right now.

10:54.834 --> 11:00.270
"But if you leave your name, number
and time that you called..."

11:08.513 --> 11:10.145
Here.

11:11.181 --> 11:13.814
Water. I hate this.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.584
Oh, I hate this.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.185
Hey.

11:30.762 --> 11:32.762
Son of a bitch.

11:32.764 --> 11:34.997
This is ridiculous.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.166
I don't have time for this.

11:39.801 --> 11:40.366
Okay.

11:40.368 --> 11:44.269
Call her up. Tell Cynthia we got
her a spot on the <i> Today Show.</i>

11:44.271 --> 11:44.969
Yeah. She'll be happy.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.638
They're gonna do it at her house.
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

11:47.640 --> 11:52.409
Tell her to do something with that kitchen.
Rent some groceries or something.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.810
Yeah. Okay. Hold on a minute.

11:53.812 --> 11:56.079
Got any messages for the office?
Mmm-mmm.

11:56.081 --> 11:58.548
All right, see you in a minute.

12:00.018 --> 12:04.320
Hey. Equal time. Now can we talk for a minute?
This is important.

12:04.322 --> 12:09.758
I spoke with Robin yesterday
about that Chinese healer.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.593
Don't give me that look.
He helped her father.

12:11.595 --> 12:13.328
Oh, hon, a healer. Come on.

12:13.330 --> 12:17.298
I may have cancer,
but it's not in my brain.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.399
Besides, you know what they
say about Chinese healers.

12:19.401 --> 12:25.304
They heal you. You feel fine. Half hour
later, you need to be healed again.

12:27.775 --> 12:29.674
Hon, listen to me.

12:29.676 --> 12:34.345
Eight percent of all people on
Interleukin-2 have total remission.

12:34.347 --> 12:36.847
Survival for people
on laetrile is around 6%.

12:36.849 --> 12:41.585
I figure if you add up all the percentages
of all the things I'm trying,

12:41.587 --> 12:46.289
I've got about a 122%
chance of survival here.

12:46.491 --> 12:50.526
Come on. Don't give up
hope on me, babe.

12:54.298 --> 12:55.363
Okay, um,

12:55.365 --> 12:57.932
tell George to go over to Oshman's
and pick up some baseball bats,

12:57.934 --> 13:03.003
gloves and t-shirts and balls and stuff
and send 'em over to Randy Spikes.

13:03.005 --> 13:05.505
Tell him to get his kid
in little league.

13:05.507 --> 13:07.273
We'll worry about
the contracts later.

13:07.275 --> 13:08.007
That's so sweet.

13:08.009 --> 13:11.610
Yeah, I'm a wonderful human being.
All right, what next? Uh, telegram.

13:11.612 --> 13:18.216
Hey! George, come on in. Gimme a
minute, would you? Get the door.

13:18.651 --> 13:19.883
Thanks.

13:19.885 --> 13:22.218
Hey, how'd it go?
You finish it up?

13:22.220 --> 13:23.452
It's not gonna work, Mr. Jones.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.354
It's just not happening. Maybe
I'm not the person to do this.

13:26.356 --> 13:30.458
No, no. You wanted to be a filmmaker, right?
This is your shot.

13:30.460 --> 13:31.592
I know. I'm sorry.

13:31.594 --> 13:32.960
Maybe you need a professional,

13:32.962 --> 13:34.394
someone who knows
how to open people up...

13:34.396 --> 13:36.963
No, no. You're great.
You're the man, George.

13:36.965 --> 13:38.064
I'm sure. Let me see the tape.

13:38.066 --> 13:40.566
You got the tape.
Let me see it.

13:41.468 --> 13:42.467
It's not very good.
I don't think...

13:42.469 --> 13:44.402
Come on. Come on.
Let's go look at it.

13:44.404 --> 13:45.603
Okay.

13:45.605 --> 13:49.073
<i>Oh, hold on.</i>
<i>I left my lens cap on.</i>

13:49.175 --> 13:52.209
<i>All right, I'm ready. Rolling.</i>

13:52.211 --> 13:53.143
<i>What exactly does he want?</i>

13:53.145 --> 13:55.979
<i>Just a few words. Things
you remember about him,</i>

13:55.981 --> 13:58.147
<i>funny moments,</i>
<i>things like that.</i>

13:58.149 --> 14:00.282
<i>What's he want this for?</i>
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

14:00.284 --> 14:05.487
<i>I think it's some kind of a surprise.
He doesn't want his wife to know.</i>

14:05.489 --> 14:07.889
<i>Has anyone else done it?</i>
<i>Brenda.</i>

14:08.258 --> 14:12.426
<i>Look, why don't you get somebody
else to do this first, okay?</i>

14:12.694 --> 14:17.129
<i>Bob Jones is one of the great
men in public relations.</i>

14:17.131 --> 14:21.533
LA Magazine <i> rated him one of the
top-10 most powerful men in the field.</i>

14:21.535 --> 14:27.472
<i>He's charming, clever, funny,
a real wheeler-dealer.</i>

14:27.474 --> 14:28.172
This is good.

14:28.174 --> 14:30.107
<i>What about personal stuff?</i>

14:32.878 --> 14:33.476
<i>Personal?</i>

14:33.478 --> 14:37.580
<i>Yeah. Whatever you talk
about outside the office.</i>

14:38.583 --> 14:41.150
<i>Sports, movies.</i>
<i>Come on. You know.</i>

14:42.253 --> 14:43.285
<i>He loves the Raiders.</i>

14:43.287 --> 14:45.787
There. I love the Raiders.
Okay. Good, good.

14:45.789 --> 14:48.422
<i>I've known Mr. Jones</i>
<i>for five months now,</i>

14:48.424 --> 14:52.259
<i>and he's the best boss</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

14:52.861 --> 14:53.826
<i>Ever.</i>

14:53.828 --> 14:56.328
<i>He never complains</i>
<i>when I disconnect him,</i>

14:56.330 --> 15:01.433
<i>or lose a call or give him</i>
<i>the wrong phone message.</i>

15:01.435 --> 15:05.270
<i>He's very compassionate, and...</i>

15:05.272 --> 15:08.873
<i>I just think</i>
<i>he's a really great guy.</i>

15:09.075 --> 15:12.810
<i>Can I do it one more time?</i>
<i>One more, I swear.</i>

15:12.812 --> 15:15.212
<i>I'll get it right.</i> We
did it four times.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.980
Four times? Yeah.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.114
<i>You sure it's off?</i>

15:18.116 --> 15:19.915
Oh, no. I didn't
know this recorded.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.784
<i>Well, the truth is, I mean, um...
</i> I wanna see this.

15:22.786 --> 15:27.522
<i>I don't really know him. I don't
know if anybody really knows him.</i>

15:27.524 --> 15:28.923
<i>I mean, um, including himself.</i>

15:28.925 --> 15:33.060
<i>He's not exactly what</i>
<i>you'd call an examined life.</i>

15:33.395 --> 15:34.927
<i>Well, God, this is tricky.</i>
<i>I mean, uh...</i>

15:34.929 --> 15:39.231
<i>I mean, the truth is he's
really a product of his own PR.</i>

15:39.233 --> 15:40.031
<i>What do you mean?</i>

15:40.033 --> 15:44.835
<i>Well, I mean, like, his MBA. He told everybody
he went to the University of Michigan.</i>

15:44.837 --> 15:50.273
<i>In fact, he graduated from Wayne State.
Only spent one semester at Michigan.</i>

15:50.875 --> 15:52.474
<i>Oh, he's brilliant</i>
<i>with resumes.</i>

15:52.476 --> 15:57.178
<i>His name's not even Jones. It's,
uh, Ivanovich or something.</i>

15:57.180 --> 15:58.512
<i>Why is that light blinking?</i>

15:58.514 --> 16:00.847
<i>I think it means</i>
<i>the battery's charged.</i>

16:00.849 --> 16:01.347
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

16:01.349 --> 16:04.950
<i>This is terrible. Isn't there
anything nice you could say?</i>

16:04.952 --> 16:08.053
<i>Go ahead. Start it. I'll
talk about his charity work.</i>

16:08.055 --> 16:12.957
<i>He'll like that.</i>
<i>Okay. I'm ready. Rolling.</i>

16:14.827 --> 16:16.626
I didn't know that recorded.

16:16.628 --> 16:19.295
No, that's okay.
It's all right.

16:20.431 --> 16:21.596
Good job, man.

16:21.598 --> 16:22.964
I'm really sorry, Mr. Jones.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.765
What? It's good.
It's very good.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.433
It's terrific.
Don't worry about it.

16:26.435 --> 16:28.301
That's the idea.

16:49.756 --> 16:51.789
Thanks, Sandy.

16:52.992 --> 16:56.727
Rosemary asked us to dinner, but
don't worry, I didn't commit.

16:56.729 --> 16:58.462
And Dr. Califano's
office called.

16:58.464 --> 17:00.697
They wanna see us on Friday.

17:00.832 --> 17:02.665
Test results.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.133
Are you listening?

17:05.135 --> 17:06.800
I can't eat any of this.

17:06.803 --> 17:08.636
Well, how about some plain chicken?
We can ask them to boil it.

17:08.637 --> 17:14.174
Yeah, but I'm gonna throw up all over the table.
I can't eat this.

17:14.175 --> 17:17.644
Okay. What about some plain rice?
That shouldn't upset your...

17:17.646 --> 17:20.613
Gail, come on.
We didn't come here for me.

17:20.615 --> 17:22.948
You been craving
Cuban food all week.

17:22.950 --> 17:24.415
Just order.

17:31.691 --> 17:33.357
I, um...

17:33.359 --> 17:36.593
I wanted to tell you
something else.

17:36.595 --> 17:37.760
I'm having another ultrasound.

17:37.762 --> 17:41.630
Not right away, down the road.
I'd like you to be there.

17:41.632 --> 17:43.298
Wait. Before you reject
this, just listen.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.801
I think it would be good for you. It
will give us a picture of the baby.

17:46.803 --> 17:53.507
You'll be able to see it. We might
even find out if it's a boy or a girl.

17:54.910 --> 17:57.443
We could choose a name,

17:57.545 --> 17:59.278
buy clothes.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.949
I need to share this
with you, Bob.

18:05.117 --> 18:09.752
Don't make me go through it alone, please.
It's our baby.

18:09.754 --> 18:14.022
Don't pretend it away.
I'm not pretending it away.

18:14.024 --> 18:17.992
I'm setting up trust funds.
I'm preparing for its future.

18:17.994 --> 18:19.960
What kind of pretending
is that?

18:19.962 --> 18:21.494
Damn it.

18:23.297 --> 18:25.363
Bob, please.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.665
Love us.

18:40.612 --> 18:42.878
Doris. Wow! Look at this.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.613
Green sludge
and my mother-in-law,

18:44.615 --> 18:45.513
together in the same room.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.115
Boy, it doesn't get much
better than this, does it?

18:48.117 --> 18:48.682
Hiya, Bobbie.

18:48.684 --> 18:50.417
What'd you do,
wake up at the crack of dawn?

18:50.419 --> 18:52.952
Oh, beautiful morning.
Just felt like a drive.

18:52.954 --> 18:53.953
I wanted to visit my daughter.

18:53.955 --> 18:57.022
Really? She didn't call you to tempt
you with leftover Cuban food?

18:57.024 --> 19:00.158
I'm too old for temptations,
Bob, especially leftovers.

19:00.160 --> 19:04.395
Well, here's to many such fine mornings.
Down the hatch.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.863
God, how can you drink that?

19:05.865 --> 19:10.567
Not too bad really when you
get to that chewy center.

19:10.635 --> 19:14.036
Mmm. It's really good.
That's disgusting.

19:14.038 --> 19:14.770
Really? Yeah.

19:14.772 --> 19:16.571
Sorry. Sure you
don't want some?

19:16.573 --> 19:17.573
Thanks. Maybe next time.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.407
Might not be a next time, Do.

19:19.409 --> 19:23.511
Mmm. You know,
you married a saint.

19:23.746 --> 19:27.748
I know. It's the
balance of nature.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.816
Together, we almost
make a normal person.

19:29.818 --> 19:34.253
I called your parents this morning.
You're kidding.

19:34.255 --> 19:37.289
What'd you do that for?
Somebody had to.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.790
I told them you were
having tests.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.258
They were grateful to know.
You should call 'em

19:40.260 --> 19:43.761
I talk to them all the time. I
just called them, when was it?

19:43.763 --> 19:48.599
Four months ago, when we found out I was pregnant.
You didn't say two words.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.700
Your mom sounded concerned.

19:50.835 --> 19:51.733
Concerned?
If she loves me so much,

19:51.735 --> 19:55.670
why doesn't she get on an airplane
and come on out here and see me?

19:55.672 --> 19:57.405
Fly? She doesn't
love God that much.

19:57.407 --> 19:58.773
You should call her.

19:58.775 --> 19:59.874
Why? We have one conversation.

19:59.876 --> 20:02.376
I don't need to keep having
it over and over again.

20:02.378 --> 20:03.477
Be grateful they're there.

20:03.479 --> 20:07.948
Look. I spent 20 years
trying to get out of Detroit.

20:08.016 --> 20:09.949
I don't need to go back.

20:10.618 --> 20:12.818
Paul's getting married.

20:13.387 --> 20:15.153
You're kidding.

20:15.688 --> 20:16.286
To whom?

20:16.288 --> 20:21.591
I don't know. Anya something.
Your mom said she was lovely.

20:21.593 --> 20:22.391
Anya. Yeah, that's perfect.

20:22.393 --> 20:26.395
Probably in food services or
sanitation, somethin' like that.

20:26.397 --> 20:29.898
It's April 21st. I thought
it might be nice if we went.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.299
You mean we're invited?

20:32.834 --> 20:37.102
Look. Forget it. I'll probably
be dead by that time anyway.

20:37.337 --> 20:41.505
Great. Then we'll have the perfect
excuse of not showing up.

20:42.341 --> 20:46.509
Come on. We haven't
been there in four years.

20:46.511 --> 20:49.279
Will you at least
think about it?

20:49.848 --> 20:50.680
I'll see.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.981
We need family, Bob.

20:51.983 --> 20:55.351
It's true. If it wasn't for
my mom, who would I have?

20:55.353 --> 20:57.019
Hmm?

20:58.689 --> 21:00.488
You'd have me.

21:02.124 --> 21:05.258
We got the lab
reports back this morning.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.994
I'm sorry, Bob.
They don't look very good.

21:07.996 --> 21:11.697
There's been no reduction
in tumor size or density.

21:11.699 --> 21:14.966
And based on your response
to the Interleukin therapy,

21:14.968 --> 21:17.902
I can't recommend
further treatment.

21:19.105 --> 21:20.003
We're losing ground, Bob.

21:20.005 --> 21:25.074
The tumor's growing, and I think you
have to face things as they are.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.943
Of course, we'll continue
to monitor everything.

21:27.945 --> 21:29.978
You could still have
three or four months.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.714
I think you should
aim for that.

21:34.884 --> 21:36.683
Four months.

21:37.152 --> 21:39.685
You have a spring
to look forward to.

21:39.687 --> 21:44.656
The symptoms won't be too bad. We
have drugs to manage the pain.

21:52.132 --> 21:56.200
What if I wanna do
the treatment again?

21:56.202 --> 21:58.035
What if I elect to do it?
Are you gonna stop me?

21:58.037 --> 21:59.803
Are you gonna get
a court order to stop me?

21:59.805 --> 22:01.471
I can't believe
you're asking this.

22:01.473 --> 22:02.872
The Interleukin
nearly killed you.

22:02.874 --> 22:07.877
It was touch and go for six hours.
And it didn't work.

22:15.319 --> 22:16.985
Come on.

22:18.854 --> 22:22.322
I'm still in the game
here, man, you know?

22:23.491 --> 22:24.456
Come on. One more.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.125
I mean, there are
a lot of other therapies.

22:27.127 --> 22:32.296
Lot of other, uh,
treatments... Right?

22:32.298 --> 22:35.365
Bob, don't make this any more
painful than it has to be.

22:35.367 --> 22:40.703
You don't have a lot of time left.
Don't waste it in futile searches.

22:41.305 --> 22:44.606
Medicine has got
some terrible limitations.

22:45.475 --> 22:48.776
And I wish there were
something more I could say.

22:49.678 --> 22:52.512
There just aren't any words.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.177
...Thursday at 2:00 PM.

23:25.179 --> 23:26.811
Mr. Jones...

23:33.719 --> 23:35.685
Who the hell do
you think you are?

23:35.687 --> 23:39.255
You think you can take away
my hope like that?

23:39.323 --> 23:41.022
Let me tell you something.

23:41.024 --> 23:44.692
That's all I have. Got it?

23:46.095 --> 23:48.061
That's all I have.

24:22.130 --> 24:24.563
I'm gonna beat
this thing, Gail.

24:27.568 --> 24:29.334
I'll beat it.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.369
I know.

24:38.411 --> 24:40.878
Look at this. This is crazy.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.814
We're gonna be lucky if we get
out of here without getting hit

24:43.816 --> 24:44.881
by a wrecking ball.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.883
Just close your eyes.

24:47.752 --> 24:48.317
Let's go home.

24:48.319 --> 24:50.652
No, we're not going anywhere. Robin's
father had pancreatic cancer.

24:50.654 --> 24:54.455
Now he doesn't. That's all
I need to know. Come on.

24:54.890 --> 24:59.559
Look at this. How can they fix bodies?
They can't even fix their own hallways.

24:59.561 --> 25:03.062
That's what we're gonna find out.
Okay.

25:04.165 --> 25:05.898
Here. 202.

25:26.553 --> 25:31.656
Which of these things doesn't
belong here? Pick two.

25:31.924 --> 25:34.958
Here. Read something.

25:42.033 --> 25:43.632
Oh. Thanks.

25:43.634 --> 25:47.168
Oh, good. Sports. Great.

25:54.510 --> 25:57.110
I feel better already.
Let's go.

25:57.745 --> 25:59.878
Mr. Jones?

26:20.867 --> 26:23.968
Take off your shoes
and lie down.

26:53.366 --> 26:53.931
How you doin'?

26:53.933 --> 26:57.901
Look. Just so you know. I'm
looking for a miracle here, so...

26:57.969 --> 26:59.835
Do you believe in miracles?

26:59.837 --> 27:01.903
I will if this works.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.306
Uh-huh. Very bad stomach, huh?

27:06.308 --> 27:08.574
You take too much Rolaids.

27:08.576 --> 27:11.843
Yeah, I do.
How'd you know that?

27:12.078 --> 27:15.879
It fell out of
your pocket. Half empty.

27:17.916 --> 27:19.415
Pretty good.

27:25.389 --> 27:26.955
Mmm-hmm.

27:27.724 --> 27:31.826
You had your appendix
out a long time ago.

27:39.969 --> 27:41.902
You were a child.

27:43.205 --> 27:44.704
Yes?

27:44.772 --> 27:46.571
Four or five?

27:47.340 --> 27:47.905
Five.

27:47.907 --> 27:51.041
Five. That's what I thought.

28:04.456 --> 28:07.156
Aha. The tumors are here.

28:07.158 --> 28:09.791
In the lungs. Two of them.

28:09.793 --> 28:11.626
Very big.

28:17.333 --> 28:20.701
Mmm-hmm. The disease
comes from the kidneys.

28:21.570 --> 28:23.136
Very sick.

28:24.506 --> 28:26.706
You just get comfortable.

28:28.009 --> 28:29.608
I work.

29:36.774 --> 29:39.441
You must relax. Relax.

29:42.112 --> 29:43.644
I am relaxed.

29:43.646 --> 29:45.412
Where's Gail?

29:45.414 --> 29:47.647
What is that? That hurt.

29:47.649 --> 29:48.280
You fight me.

29:48.282 --> 29:51.116
You make it hard for me to do.

29:51.651 --> 29:55.653
You hold too much anger inside.
It poisons you.

29:55.655 --> 29:58.422
I'm not holdin' on to anything.

30:00.926 --> 30:04.961
Do you want to carry so much
pain into your next life?

30:08.166 --> 30:09.098
My next life?

30:09.100 --> 30:11.333
The last second of your life

30:11.335 --> 30:14.903
is the most important
moment of all.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.605
It's everything you are,

30:17.607 --> 30:18.238
ever said,

30:18.240 --> 30:22.108
ever thought,
all rolled into one.

30:22.110 --> 30:25.277
That is the seed
of your next life.

30:31.818 --> 30:36.720
Until that last moment,
you still have time.

30:36.955 --> 30:39.088
You can change everything.

30:39.090 --> 30:42.991
You can let go of your fear.
You can let go of your anger.

30:44.994 --> 30:47.995
I'm not angry, okay?

30:51.734 --> 30:53.633
He's a quack.
A total charlatan quack.

30:53.635 --> 30:55.034
You didn't feel anything?

30:55.036 --> 30:56.702
Yeah, I felt
the urge to get out.

30:56.704 --> 30:58.837
Guy actually smelled my wrist.

30:58.839 --> 30:59.671
How about that?

30:59.673 --> 31:03.508
Kept telling me how angry I
was, stupid son of a bitch.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.276
What else did he say?

31:05.278 --> 31:05.943
Eh, I had no faith.

31:05.945 --> 31:08.578
A bunch of bullshit. Life is
always trying to talk to me.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.947
Life is always sending
me invitations.

31:10.949 --> 31:13.883
Yeah, I'd like to know what
invitation life sent me.

31:13.885 --> 31:16.952
You got one to your
brother's wedding.

31:16.954 --> 31:19.587
I don't think
that's what he meant.

31:26.162 --> 31:28.061
Man, come on.

31:35.336 --> 31:37.736
What the hell has
gotten into you?

31:41.141 --> 31:41.906
Reincarnation?

31:41.908 --> 31:44.275
I just wanna know
if you believe in it.

31:44.577 --> 31:45.375
I don't know.

31:45.377 --> 31:47.276
Put it on the ballot,
I'll vote for it, okay?

31:47.278 --> 31:50.279
Why? I don't know. I just been
thinking about it lately.

31:50.281 --> 31:52.981
Thinking about it?
What's to think about?

31:53.984 --> 31:54.716
Come on, Bob.

31:54.718 --> 31:55.983
You make, uh, what, 250 a year?

31:55.985 --> 31:58.952
You're in the top one
percentile in the country.

31:58.954 --> 32:02.088
Stop contemplating the
afterlife and enjoy this one.

32:02.090 --> 32:04.056
I mean, don't you ever think,

32:04.058 --> 32:06.792
you know, what this all is?

32:06.794 --> 32:08.560
Why you're here,
who you really are?

32:08.562 --> 32:10.328
You never think about that? No.

32:10.330 --> 32:10.961
Never? No!

32:10.963 --> 32:13.663
What is with you all of a sudden?
You're a philosopher?

32:13.665 --> 32:17.533
I took philosophy in college.
It got me nowhere.

32:21.138 --> 32:23.038
Are you happy? Come on, Bob.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.906
No, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

32:24.908 --> 32:26.741
When is the last time you said,

32:26.743 --> 32:30.010
"You know, I'm really happy"?

32:30.012 --> 32:33.980
Okay. I was really happy when I
was beating you at racquetball.

32:33.982 --> 32:36.449
I am really happy right
now taking this sauna.

32:36.451 --> 32:41.854
I have been happy all day up until
this ridiculous conversation.

32:41.856 --> 32:43.989
You okay? Yeah.

32:44.224 --> 32:45.823
Why? I mean,
why did you ask me that?

32:45.825 --> 32:48.358
Because you're acting a
little weird in your old age.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.327
You gotta learn to stop
tormenting yourself so much.

32:51.329 --> 32:52.928
Turn it off.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.248
Hello.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.083
Hi. Carol Sandman?

33:16.085 --> 33:19.186
Sandman? Boy, that
was a long time ago.

33:19.188 --> 33:21.421
Who are you? What's
with this camera?

33:21.423 --> 33:22.622
Uh, I'm Bob.

33:22.624 --> 33:25.658
I'm, uh, Bob Ivanovich?

33:26.627 --> 33:29.160
Bobbie? Hi. Do you remember me?

33:29.162 --> 33:31.829
Oh, my God. Bobbie?

33:31.964 --> 33:33.496
I don't believe this.

33:33.498 --> 33:36.999
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

33:37.101 --> 33:38.900
Uh, do you remember
Tony Farantino?

33:38.902 --> 33:39.467
Tony.

33:39.469 --> 33:41.168
I ran into him, and he told
me you lived out here.

33:41.170 --> 33:45.038
Oh, my God. This is so amazing.
I mean...

33:45.040 --> 33:47.206
It's got to be, what,
25, 30 years?

33:47.208 --> 33:48.974
Look at you.
You're all grown up.

33:48.976 --> 33:50.375
Body hair and everything.

33:50.377 --> 33:53.311
I just can't believe this.

33:54.314 --> 33:55.313
It's so amazing.

33:55.315 --> 33:57.481
I mean, how can you
not remember anything?

33:57.483 --> 33:59.883
You lived right next door
to me, for crying out loud.

33:59.885 --> 34:02.151
I know. I must have
repressed everything.

34:02.153 --> 34:04.820
I mean, I remember
your parents vaguely.

34:04.822 --> 34:05.754
And I remember your brother.

34:05.756 --> 34:07.689
Oh, he's married now.
He has three kids

34:07.691 --> 34:09.791
and he owns a gun shop
in San Antonio.

34:09.793 --> 34:12.159
Really? It's so good to see you.

34:12.161 --> 34:13.761
Thanks. I've got
two kids myself.

34:13.763 --> 34:15.661
I know it looks
like a lot more.

34:15.664 --> 34:16.929
My oldest, Mara,
is in preschool,

34:16.931 --> 34:19.464
and Sophia is probably gonna
wake up any minute now

34:19.466 --> 34:21.299
so you'll meet her. Thanks.

34:21.301 --> 34:23.567
Well, Gail and I
are having our first one.

34:23.569 --> 34:26.536
Oh, Bobbie, that's so exciting.
A little Bobbie.

34:26.538 --> 34:29.237
It is very exciting. In fact,
that's what the tape is for.

34:29.239 --> 34:34.710
I wanted to make something to show him
or her, whomever it's going to be,

34:34.712 --> 34:35.911
you know, who I was.

34:35.913 --> 34:37.478
That's a great idea.
That really is.

34:37.481 --> 34:40.782
Yeah. There's only one problem.
I can't remember anything.

34:40.784 --> 34:42.917
Oh, come on. Sure you can.
Uh-uh.

34:42.918 --> 34:47.688
You don't remember how you and me
used to laugh together for hours?

34:47.690 --> 34:48.288
No.

34:48.290 --> 34:49.989
Oh, and we used to sit in my
bedroom and listen to Petula Clark

34:49.991 --> 34:53.859
sing <i> Downtown</i> over and over
again, and you would dance.

34:53.860 --> 34:56.895
I danced? I was a dancer.
You danced.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.097
Oh, and you were so funny. You
were always making up stories.

35:00.099 --> 35:04.201
Like once you tried to convince us
that your dad was a secret FBI agent.

35:04.203 --> 35:07.337
You remember that? Oh, well, my
dad was an secret FBI agent.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.338
That part was true.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.808
And how when you grew up,
you were going to famous?

35:11.810 --> 35:12.508
No, I don't remember.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.042
And you always
had these dreams.

35:14.044 --> 35:15.610
And I mean, look at you.

35:15.612 --> 35:17.678
You made it happen.
It's really amazing.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.779
Well, I mean, I don't know...

35:18.781 --> 35:21.681
You did. Kind of, yeah.

35:21.683 --> 35:25.885
Oop, here we go. Baby time.

35:26.921 --> 35:29.554
That's good.
That looks natural.

35:29.556 --> 35:31.489
Yeah? Doesn't feel natural.

35:31.491 --> 35:32.556
Oh, it just takes
a little practice.

35:32.558 --> 35:36.059
You're gonna be a really great father.
I can tell. Really.

35:36.061 --> 35:38.261
Yeah, what do you know
that I don't know?

35:38.263 --> 35:40.296
Here. Let's trade.

35:40.531 --> 35:43.532
Here you go. Yeah. Got it?

35:43.534 --> 35:46.001
Yeah. There we are.

35:46.069 --> 35:46.567
There we are.

35:46.569 --> 35:49.269
You know what my Uncle
Rudy always used to say?

35:49.271 --> 35:52.272
He said the best thing parents
can do for their kids

35:52.274 --> 35:53.373
is just love each other.

35:53.375 --> 35:55.308
"Kids need to marinate
in love," he said,

35:55.310 --> 36:00.179
"And after about 16 years,
they're really juicy."

36:00.181 --> 36:01.046
That's great.

36:01.048 --> 36:03.848
See, I knew I needed
to see you for something.

36:03.850 --> 36:06.984
Well, seek and ye shall find.
Yeah.

36:06.986 --> 36:09.453
I never been much of a seeker.

36:09.455 --> 36:10.320
Hey, what are you
talking about?

36:10.322 --> 36:12.822
You're here, you found
me, didn't you?

36:12.824 --> 36:15.191
It's really great
to be here, Carol.

36:44.654 --> 36:47.321
Okay. Uh, music.

36:47.323 --> 36:49.856
This is actually a pretty
important subject.

36:49.858 --> 36:51.791
Uh, try to stay with the classics.
I would say, uh,

36:51.793 --> 36:57.429
Stones, Elvis, Stevie Wonder, James
Brown always. Anything Motown.

36:57.431 --> 36:59.164
Uh, don't get into any
trendy music, you know?

36:59.166 --> 37:04.936
Anything where a guy would set
himself on fire, I would avoid.

37:04.938 --> 37:07.571
Your mother is going to be
of no help in this area.

37:07.573 --> 37:10.040
She will try to fill your
head with show tunes.

37:10.042 --> 37:10.840
If she starts singing...

37:10.842 --> 37:14.243
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>
<i>you will meet... ¶</i>

37:14.245 --> 37:15.911
Turn and run
the opposite direction.

37:15.913 --> 37:20.548
Otherwise, you're gonna have <i> South
Pacific</i> coming out your nostrils.

37:20.550 --> 37:23.050
Uh, Temps. Temptations.

37:23.052 --> 37:23.717
Can't lose.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.152
You can't lose with the Temps.
Uh, Smokey...

37:30.024 --> 37:31.323
What next?

37:31.325 --> 37:36.127
<i>All right, now, this is a little
bit of a delicate subject.</i>

37:36.329 --> 37:41.065
<i>Someday your mom may want
to get married again.</i>

37:41.067 --> 37:43.400
<i>And this might make you
feel a little strange</i>

37:43.402 --> 37:44.467
<i>or even a little angry,</i>

37:44.469 --> 37:48.637
<i>like maybe she's</i>
<i>being disloyal to me.</i>

37:49.706 --> 37:52.807
<i>Well, let's think this over.</i>

37:53.009 --> 37:57.911
<i>Your mom is a pretty</i>
<i>wonderful person.</i>

37:58.046 --> 38:03.315
<i>She's funny and nice</i>
<i>and pretty and smart.</i>

38:03.317 --> 38:04.949
<i>She married me, didn't she?</i>

38:04.951 --> 38:08.652
<i>And she might also get lonely,
and maybe she'll meet some guy</i>

38:08.654 --> 38:11.621
<i>who's a really nice guy</i>
<i>and you really like him,</i>

38:11.623 --> 38:13.389
<i>and he plays baseball with you,</i>

38:13.391 --> 38:15.958
<i>and takes you to Lakers games.</i>

38:16.360 --> 38:19.728
<i>And don't worry about me</i>
<i>being jealous 'cause...</i>

38:20.197 --> 38:22.063
<i>Well, I might be</i>
<i>a little jealous,</i>

38:22.065 --> 38:26.300
<i>'cause he'll be doing all the
things that I wanna do with you.</i>

38:28.203 --> 38:30.203
<i>But if he's smart,</i>

38:30.205 --> 38:32.605
<i>he won't ever try</i>
<i>to take my place.</i>

38:32.607 --> 38:35.407
<i>'Cause you know and I know</i>

38:35.409 --> 38:41.112
<i>that I'm your dad, and that's
never gonna change, ever.</i>

38:41.114 --> 38:44.348
<i>I'm not saying this is
going to happen for sure.</i>

38:44.350 --> 38:47.150
<i>I'm just saying if it happens,</i>

38:47.152 --> 38:49.385
<i>I wanted you</i>
<i>to know how I feel.</i>

38:49.387 --> 38:53.956
<i>I mean, we both want
your mom to be happy.</i>

38:53.958 --> 38:55.691
<i>Don't we?</i>

39:00.431 --> 39:02.597
Why didn't you tell me?

39:06.369 --> 39:08.268
I couldn't.

39:10.571 --> 39:13.738
Well, I wish I could
tell you that I love it,

39:14.841 --> 39:17.808
that I admire what you've done.

39:20.846 --> 39:22.545
But mostly I...

39:22.547 --> 39:25.814
It just really hurts me, Bob.

39:26.750 --> 39:31.085
I know maybe it
shouldn't, but it does.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.821
Why can't you tell me
these things?

39:34.823 --> 39:37.023
Why is it you can tell
all this to a camera,

39:37.025 --> 39:40.626
you can open your heart
to a machine?

39:41.595 --> 39:43.928
I'm flesh and blood.

39:43.930 --> 39:46.764
I'm here for you anytime.

39:47.533 --> 39:50.967
Your silence isn't
protecting me, Bob.

39:51.869 --> 39:54.502
I feel like
I've already lost you.

39:55.605 --> 39:58.772
Like we've lost each other.

39:59.641 --> 40:01.240
What do you want me to say?

40:01.242 --> 40:04.543
Don't say anything.
Just hear me.

40:04.545 --> 40:08.847
Bob, I need you. I need you too.
I can't do this alone.

40:08.849 --> 40:10.882
I need you to be there.

40:16.187 --> 40:17.986
How can I be there?

40:17.988 --> 40:19.988
Let me inside.

40:21.591 --> 40:23.924
Share what you're feeling.

40:27.796 --> 40:29.962
That's all I need.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.084
Bob! Bob, it's all right.

40:55.086 --> 40:58.287
It's all right.
It's okay. I'm here.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.355
Hey, it's all right.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.825
I don't wanna die.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.726
Don't let me die, Gail.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.494
No, it's okay.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.896
It's okay.

41:26.448 --> 41:28.281
I wanna live.

41:30.718 --> 41:32.451
I know.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.460
I wanna live.

41:43.996 --> 41:46.196
If you want to know the truth,

41:46.198 --> 41:48.598
I'm surprised you came back.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.367
If you wanna know
the truth, so am I.

41:51.369 --> 41:53.035
Most people like you come once.

41:53.037 --> 41:55.237
Then never see them again.

41:55.239 --> 41:57.138
My wife talked me into it.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.039
Oh, she's very good woman.

41:59.041 --> 42:00.507
Yeah, she is, very good.

42:00.509 --> 42:03.343
That's why I married her
as a matter of fact.

42:03.345 --> 42:05.178
It's not enough
to marry goodness.

42:05.180 --> 42:08.447
You have to find it
in yourself.

42:08.982 --> 42:10.982
Try and relax.

42:11.951 --> 42:14.051
I am relaxed.

42:14.253 --> 42:16.219
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

42:29.534 --> 42:31.667
What the hell are
you doing to me?

42:31.669 --> 42:34.970
That was good.
I got some poison out.

42:34.972 --> 42:37.292
Now I can see more clearly.

42:38.041 --> 42:42.543
Your anger is very
deep and very old.

42:43.345 --> 42:45.378
Who you been talking
to, my wife?

42:45.380 --> 42:46.812
I talk to nobody.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.680
I just listen to your heart.

42:48.682 --> 42:53.751
But if you listen to it,
you will not need me.

42:55.121 --> 42:57.621
Your heart is crying out.

42:58.056 --> 42:59.422
Forgive.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.493
Forgive who?

43:05.662 --> 43:08.496
I don't have anybody
to forgive.

43:09.499 --> 43:13.234
Here we are, winging our way
across the breadbasket of America,

43:13.236 --> 43:15.703
on our way to
picturesque Detroit.

43:15.705 --> 43:20.507
Now, do you wanna know why we're
making this epic 2,000 mile journey?

43:20.509 --> 43:25.712
Let me put on your mom, who
will explain to you why. Mom?

43:25.714 --> 43:29.716
Tell your child why it is we're
going back to the one place

43:29.718 --> 43:31.350
I tried hardest
to get away from.

43:31.352 --> 43:37.723
Because your Uncle Paul is getting
married, and they invited us to come.

43:38.125 --> 43:40.158
Oh, because this video
wouldn't be complete

43:40.160 --> 43:42.827
without showing where
your father used to live.

43:42.829 --> 43:47.932
Right. Because your father
needs to see his family.

43:49.135 --> 43:52.169
You want more? No. See?

43:52.171 --> 43:54.371
Here we are with the
Detroit Police Department

43:54.373 --> 43:59.342
on a secret raid in a hotel room
in suburban drug-infested Detroit.

44:01.746 --> 44:03.078
Here's the suspect over here,

44:03.080 --> 44:04.746
lying flat,
passed out on the bed.

44:04.748 --> 44:08.750
Begin undercover operation. Let's
go right under the covers.

44:08.752 --> 44:11.786
Ooh. Suspect has good legs.

44:12.722 --> 44:14.621
And a really big tummy.

44:14.623 --> 44:17.657
Bob, what are you doing, hmm?

44:17.659 --> 44:18.257
Open your eyes.

44:18.259 --> 44:20.292
I want to see if your
pupils are dilated.

44:20.294 --> 44:23.228
Oh, come on.
Go shoot something useful.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.997
You don't mind, do you, honey?

44:26.165 --> 44:27.497
You take your pills?

44:27.499 --> 44:30.066
Fully medicated, babe.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.435
Just drive carefully.

44:35.604 --> 44:38.104
Joking. See you. Oh!

44:39.173 --> 44:41.640
Oh. Am I bleeding?

44:52.486 --> 44:53.885
Hmm.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.559
It's so small.

46:23.673 --> 46:25.839
Mommy! Mommy! Oh, it's okay.

46:25.841 --> 46:27.907
It's okay. I'm Bob Jones.

46:27.909 --> 46:29.341
Er, Ivanovich. I lived here.

46:29.343 --> 46:31.376
This used to be my house.

46:32.445 --> 46:35.112
Years ago. It's okay, really.

46:48.894 --> 46:52.028
Do you mind... Sure. Go ahead.

47:35.106 --> 47:35.571
Hi.

47:35.573 --> 47:38.507
Did you used to sleep
up here, too?

47:38.809 --> 47:40.708
Yeah. When I was little,

47:40.710 --> 47:42.009
about your age.

47:42.011 --> 47:43.443
In my bed?

47:43.812 --> 47:45.444
No. No, I had my own bed,

47:45.446 --> 47:48.680
right here against the wall,
right by the window,

47:48.682 --> 47:52.350
and the people who lived
over here were called Sandman.

47:52.352 --> 47:55.586
That's the Robinsons,
they live there, now.

47:55.588 --> 47:57.020
Oh, yeah?

47:57.589 --> 47:59.755
My brother's bed used
to be right over there.

47:59.757 --> 48:02.724
We used to talk all night long.

48:02.726 --> 48:04.392
You want to see where I hide?

48:04.394 --> 48:05.693
Sure.

48:13.969 --> 48:15.234
Ah.

48:15.569 --> 48:17.435
I used to hide in here.

48:17.437 --> 48:19.804
It's a good hiding
spot, isn't it?

48:19.806 --> 48:21.205
Yeah.

48:27.978 --> 48:28.509
Bobbie?

48:28.511 --> 48:30.611
What are you doing in there?

48:30.613 --> 48:32.846
What is all this
about a circus?

48:32.848 --> 48:35.081
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

48:35.083 --> 48:36.248
Are you lying to me?

48:36.250 --> 48:36.915
You're the liar.

48:36.917 --> 48:40.518
You said you were gonna
take us to the circus.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.118
You promised.

48:41.120 --> 48:44.087
No, Bobbie. I did not promise.

48:44.089 --> 48:45.254
I said I would try.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.123
You promise things,
but you never do them.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.058
What is it you want, Bobbie?

48:50.060 --> 48:52.260
You want food on the table?

48:52.262 --> 48:52.860
People have to work.

48:52.862 --> 48:54.595
That's all you ever do.
You always work.

48:54.597 --> 48:58.565
You're never, ever home. You
never do anything with us.

48:58.567 --> 49:00.967
I hate you. I hate you.

49:02.503 --> 49:05.570
I never heard that story before.
How come you never told me?

49:05.572 --> 49:07.271
I totally forgot about it.

49:07.273 --> 49:10.674
I must have blanked it out
or something. How's this?

49:10.842 --> 49:12.508
Can you imagine?

49:13.210 --> 49:15.243
I invited my entire class

49:15.245 --> 49:17.311
to a circus in my back yard.

49:17.313 --> 49:20.314
Why would I do
something like that?

49:20.316 --> 49:22.149
Maybe for attention.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.016
Yeah, maybe.

49:24.518 --> 49:25.517
I mean,

49:25.519 --> 49:26.818
I really thought
it would be there.

49:26.820 --> 49:30.922
I thought I'd go home and there'd be a circus there.
I really believed it.

49:30.924 --> 49:33.424
<i>¶ Someday I'll wish upon a star</i>

49:33.426 --> 49:37.194
<i>¶ And wake up where</i>
<i>the clouds are far behind me.</i>

49:37.196 --> 49:38.061
Why are you doing that?

49:38.063 --> 49:39.662
<i>¶ Where troubles</i>
<i>melt like lemon drops</i>

49:39.664 --> 49:42.064
<i>¶ Away upon the chimney tops.</i>

49:42.066 --> 49:42.764
Okay. All right.

49:42.766 --> 49:43.664
<i>¶ That's where you'll find me</i>

49:43.666 --> 49:48.168
<i>¶ Somewhere over the rainbow</i>
<i>bluebirds... ¶</i>

49:48.170 --> 49:50.670
The people are
gonna be, like...

49:50.672 --> 49:51.570
...next door.

49:52.706 --> 49:54.405
You're a believer.

49:58.110 --> 49:59.642
It's so weird.

50:01.579 --> 50:03.412
I don't even know
who that person was.

50:03.414 --> 50:06.748
Oh, come on.
Sounds just like you.

50:06.750 --> 50:07.782
What do you mean?

50:07.784 --> 50:09.917
You're still a ringmaster.

50:09.919 --> 50:11.551
Bob Jones, public relations,

50:11.553 --> 50:14.887
except instead of wishing for
circuses, you're creating them.

50:14.889 --> 50:18.156
You got 20 rings all going
at the same time.

50:19.359 --> 50:21.158
It's really sweet.

50:21.426 --> 50:22.525
Hmm.

50:22.527 --> 50:25.561
In some ways you're
still just that little boy.

50:50.586 --> 50:52.886
"Star light, star bright.

50:54.122 --> 50:56.455
"First star I see tonight.

50:58.025 --> 51:00.625
"I wish I may, I wish I might.

51:00.893 --> 51:03.460
"Have the wish I wish tonight."

51:06.131 --> 51:07.864
Please, God,

51:08.533 --> 51:12.701
just let me live long
enough to see my child.

51:15.372 --> 51:18.206
That's all I'm asking.

51:28.318 --> 51:30.017
How do I look?

51:30.019 --> 51:31.519
I feel fat.

51:31.754 --> 51:33.320
Don't worry about it.

51:34.022 --> 51:35.755
They'd love you.

51:35.890 --> 51:37.322
Come on.

51:41.361 --> 51:45.529
Bobbie! Oh, my God!
Gail and Bobbie! Oh!

51:45.531 --> 51:48.064
Rose, come here! Mr. Hollywood.

51:48.366 --> 51:50.099
How are things in movie land?

51:50.101 --> 51:51.200
Bobbie! Bobbie!

51:51.202 --> 51:53.702
Come here. Give me a kiss!

51:53.904 --> 51:56.604
Gail, look at that tummy.

51:56.606 --> 51:58.138
I know.

51:59.674 --> 52:00.739
Bobbie, how are you?

52:00.741 --> 52:03.241
You're gonna be
a grandfather, huh?

52:06.913 --> 52:08.946
I'm glad to look at you.

52:09.214 --> 52:10.713
Gail!

52:25.428 --> 52:27.928
Two words. Weight Watchers.

52:27.930 --> 52:31.431
I thought instead of having a wedding
I'd be having a nervous breakdown,

52:31.433 --> 52:34.033
because my husband
wasn't at the church.

52:34.035 --> 52:36.301
He and the best man got lost.

52:36.303 --> 52:37.335
He always got lost.

52:37.337 --> 52:38.803
You remember.

52:38.805 --> 52:40.504
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you

52:40.506 --> 52:42.806
but I have a wedding
to attend to tomorrow.

52:42.808 --> 52:44.140
Let's go, honey.
It's getting late.

52:44.142 --> 52:46.942
Ooh, it is getting late.
Goodbye, everybody.

52:46.944 --> 52:48.109
Bye-bye. Bye.

52:48.111 --> 52:48.676
Hey, Bob,

52:48.678 --> 52:51.512
don't you ever come out from
behind that thing, huh?

52:51.514 --> 52:52.779
Nah.

52:53.081 --> 52:53.779
Just kidding.

52:53.781 --> 52:58.150
Okay, hi. My name is Paul.
I'm your uncle,

52:58.152 --> 52:59.518
your father's baby brother,

52:59.520 --> 53:02.888
the one he hasn't talked to
in nearly two years.

53:03.590 --> 53:04.689
Got that in there.

53:04.691 --> 53:09.026
And this is my fiancee,
Annie. Annie Stasiuk.

53:09.028 --> 53:09.726
Not for long.

53:09.728 --> 53:13.062
And over there is her
parents, Lida and Nestor.

53:13.064 --> 53:14.797
I'm Lida. I'm Nestor.

53:18.736 --> 53:21.303
This is my dad,
your grandfather,

53:21.305 --> 53:23.638
Bill Ivanovich. Dad, wake up.

53:23.640 --> 53:27.041
Wave away that smoke
and say hello.

53:27.643 --> 53:28.808
Hello?

53:28.810 --> 53:31.443
Okay.

53:31.445 --> 53:32.977
This is Rose.

53:32.979 --> 53:34.278
This is your grandmother.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.647
It's my mom. Come on, Rose,

53:36.649 --> 53:38.382
say something to the camera.

53:38.384 --> 53:40.384
I've got nothing to say.

53:40.386 --> 53:42.953
Stop hiding behind that thing.

53:42.955 --> 53:44.354
Let us see you.

53:44.356 --> 53:46.489
Turn it off, already. Ma, Ma.

53:46.491 --> 53:47.523
It's not a lineup.

53:47.525 --> 53:49.324
You're not in the mafia,
are you?

53:49.326 --> 53:51.926
Turn it off.

53:52.595 --> 53:54.161
God, my back is killing me.

53:54.163 --> 53:56.429
I gotta get out of this stuff.

53:57.064 --> 53:57.962
So scary.

53:57.964 --> 54:01.832
Smartest thing I ever did
was get away from here.

54:01.834 --> 54:03.400
They really love you, though.

54:03.402 --> 54:05.769
Underneath it all,
you can feel it,

54:05.771 --> 54:07.137
you really can.

54:07.139 --> 54:10.039
What are you feeling with,
your feet?

54:11.075 --> 54:12.040
Poor Paul.

54:12.042 --> 54:14.776
He had his chance
to escape. He blew it.

54:14.778 --> 54:15.777
It was his choice.

54:15.779 --> 54:17.111
If he would have
only listened to me.

54:17.113 --> 54:20.814
You know, there are thousands of
great jobs in LA, great women...

54:20.816 --> 54:24.284
Now he's stuck in the junk business
with my father. What a waste.

54:24.286 --> 54:24.884
Oh, come on.

54:24.886 --> 54:29.288
You're here to make peace. Enjoy
them for what they are. Accept them.

54:29.290 --> 54:30.989
They're yours.

54:46.840 --> 54:52.210
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

54:52.212 --> 54:57.448
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

54:57.450 --> 55:02.820
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

55:03.222 --> 55:07.891
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

55:07.893 --> 55:13.296
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

55:13.765 --> 55:21.237
<i>¶ Hallelujah ¶</i>

55:22.340 --> 55:26.809
Lord, our God, crown them
with glory and honor.

57:10.177 --> 57:11.943
Wow! Come on!

57:46.277 --> 57:49.411
Hey, Bobbie. Bobbie, come on!

57:50.213 --> 57:51.679
No, no.

57:53.015 --> 57:53.613
Aw, go on!

57:53.615 --> 57:56.882
I'm doing this. Dance with me, Bobbie.
Come on.

58:25.779 --> 58:27.145
I can't breathe.

58:27.147 --> 58:28.779
It's okay.

58:46.264 --> 58:48.631
Four tornadoes, I said, not 12.

58:48.633 --> 58:52.001
The day you were born,
there were four tornadoes.

58:52.003 --> 58:55.471
One in Hamtramck
and three in Detroit,

58:55.473 --> 58:57.439
and nobody was killed.

58:57.441 --> 58:59.941
You exaggerate things.

59:00.076 --> 59:00.774
Yeah, but you said...

59:00.776 --> 59:04.444
All right, you said I was a born disaster, right?
I mean, that's a quote.

59:04.446 --> 59:08.047
Oh, when you were four, yes.
A holy terror.

59:08.049 --> 59:09.681
How about when I was 10?

59:09.683 --> 59:11.516
You were different at 10.

59:11.518 --> 59:13.751
You used to disappear for
hours into the basement.

59:13.753 --> 59:17.888
You would play with your trains.
You had an erector set...

59:17.890 --> 59:19.189
We never saw you.

59:19.191 --> 59:23.459
Why? What happened?
Why did I disappear?

59:24.728 --> 59:25.460
You, uh...

59:25.462 --> 59:28.396
You were ashamed of us by then.

59:28.398 --> 59:30.898
You hid everything from us.

59:31.433 --> 59:32.865
You didn't bring
your friends home.

59:32.867 --> 59:38.637
One time, your mother came to the
school to talk to the teacher,

59:38.639 --> 59:41.339
and you pretended
not to know her.

59:41.341 --> 59:43.441
Not to know your own mother.

59:43.443 --> 59:44.942
She cried for two days.

59:44.944 --> 59:46.910
Dad, come on.
It's my wedding day.

59:46.912 --> 59:50.747
What'd I tell you? Every time we
get together this shit happens.

59:50.749 --> 59:52.982
Well, what do you think...

59:52.984 --> 59:55.417
I mean, why do you
think I did that?

59:55.419 --> 59:57.719
It was a long time ago.

59:57.721 --> 01:00:00.254
You always thought
you were too good for us.

01:00:00.256 --> 01:00:02.055
That was your problem.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.525
I think that...

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.759
I...

01:00:07.927 --> 01:00:10.928
I think your kid should know

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:13.931
that his father was too
good for his own family,

01:00:13.933 --> 01:00:17.200
that the first chance
he gets, he runs away.

01:00:17.202 --> 01:00:21.771
He changes his name,
and he doesn't ever come back.

01:00:22.774 --> 01:00:25.508
You know, you're
changing the subject.

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.742
I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:00:26.744 --> 01:00:31.446
I'm not changing anything. You're the
one who changes things, "Jones".

01:00:31.448 --> 01:00:33.581
What's the matter?
You don't like my name?

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:36.483
Your father's name?
Your grandfather's name?

01:00:36.485 --> 01:00:39.919
I'm sorry. Please, Dad.
Just forget it, you know...

01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:42.955
Change everything.
You run from everything.

01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:44.856
You know what?

01:00:45.158 --> 01:00:46.891
I never ran.

01:00:47.026 --> 01:00:49.559
I never ran. I left!

01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:51.160
You know why? I wanted a life.

01:00:51.162 --> 01:00:53.529
You can't have
a life with your family?

01:00:53.531 --> 01:00:58.867
If it wasn't for your wife, for her
phone calls, you'd be a dead man to us.

01:00:58.869 --> 01:01:00.201
That's the truth!
What do you want me to do?

01:01:00.203 --> 01:01:04.238
You want me to call and listen to
this same stuff over and over again?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.841
Why would I do... Why would
any rational person do that?

01:01:07.843 --> 01:01:10.176
A man who loves
his family calls them.

01:01:10.178 --> 01:01:13.379
Oh. Dad, he really
does love you.

01:01:13.681 --> 01:01:15.080
Not in my book.

01:01:15.082 --> 01:01:16.081
Don't tell me...

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.515
Don't tell me about love, okay?

01:01:17.517 --> 01:01:21.652
You know why? Now
shut up for a minute.

01:01:22.087 --> 01:01:25.288
I've lived in Los Angeles
10 years.

01:01:27.592 --> 01:01:30.059
You never came to see me once.

01:01:32.963 --> 01:01:36.264
You never saw what kind
of business I made,

01:01:36.332 --> 01:01:37.998
what kind of life I live,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.467
so don't tell me about love.

01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:43.937
Come on, Bobbie.
You know Mom doesn't fly.

01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:44.837
What about trains?

01:01:44.839 --> 01:01:47.406
It's too far.
I can't go that far.

01:01:47.408 --> 01:01:48.974
See? Exactly.

01:01:49.676 --> 01:01:51.075
See?

01:01:51.077 --> 01:01:53.177
Now, maybe when
the baby is born.

01:01:53.179 --> 01:01:55.512
Yeah. Right. Right.
Then I can come.

01:01:55.514 --> 01:01:57.514
You know what? Forget it.

01:01:57.516 --> 01:02:01.584
We'd just hack over the same shit anyway.
It's boring.

01:02:16.565 --> 01:02:19.833
How do people's
lives come to this?

01:02:24.406 --> 01:02:27.140
I gotta tell you
something, Bobbie.

01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:31.176
I love you.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.446
I really do, but...

01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:38.148
You can be

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:41.951
a stuck-up, arrogant son of a
bitch sometimes. You know that?

01:02:41.953 --> 01:02:43.152
I mean, you stopped
talking to me

01:02:43.154 --> 01:02:46.588
'cause I make a career
choice you don't approve of.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.589
What kind of bullshit is that?

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:50.058
That's not true, Paul.
You rejected me.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.027
Oh, man, I rejected
Los Angeles.

01:02:53.496 --> 01:02:56.363
I couldn't live
your life out there.

01:02:56.498 --> 01:02:59.632
I needed my family.
I needed my friends.

01:03:00.201 --> 01:03:01.567
All you cared about
was business.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.735
I was out there two weeks.

01:03:03.737 --> 01:03:07.038
We had dinner, what, twice?

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.640
Even then I felt like a client.

01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:13.843
You could've had a job
starting at $60,000 a year.

01:03:13.845 --> 01:03:15.778
Instead, you chose
the junk business.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.815
Scrap metal, Bobbie.
It's called scrap metal.

01:03:19.817 --> 01:03:22.651
It's junk.
It's always been junk.

01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:24.085
See, this is where we differ.

01:03:24.087 --> 01:03:27.188
You always hated Dad
for being a junk man.

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:30.524
I always loved him
for being a hard worker.

01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:31.224
That's the difference.

01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:32.959
I never said I hated him.

01:03:32.961 --> 01:03:35.528
Yeah, Bobbie, you have.

01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:38.797
Well, okay,
let's forget the semantics.

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:42.400
Look, he's your dad
for God's sake. I mean...

01:03:43.169 --> 01:03:44.935
You used to bounce
up and down on his knee.

01:03:44.937 --> 01:03:47.370
You rode the train
together to Cleveland.

01:03:47.372 --> 01:03:50.840
I remember you used to talk about
that all the time as a kid,

01:03:50.842 --> 01:03:55.244
how he took you
on the Pullman car,

01:03:55.412 --> 01:03:56.244
just the two of you.

01:03:56.246 --> 01:03:59.180
I still remember
the look in your eye.

01:04:00.983 --> 01:04:03.850
What happened
to that look, Bobbie?

01:04:07.388 --> 01:04:09.221
I don't know.

01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:13.224
You know, it's funny,

01:04:13.993 --> 01:04:16.827
for all your complaining
about Dad,

01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:21.164
I get the sense you're gonna
turn out just like him.

01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:25.701
Well, I gotta go in.
I really do.

01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:29.471
I'm leaving for my
honeymoon in half an hour.

01:04:46.623 --> 01:04:49.123
You gotta show it
to them too, Bobbie.

01:04:50.993 --> 01:04:52.726
Maybe one day.

01:04:52.728 --> 01:04:56.930
They're not gonna be
around forever, you know.

01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:09.775
It's leaving.

01:05:11.445 --> 01:05:13.244
Hey, wait!

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.846
What's the matter?

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.784
I blew it.

01:05:21.786 --> 01:05:24.720
Bob, come on. Come on.
The bus is leaving.

01:05:24.722 --> 01:05:26.121
I didn't resolve
anything, Gail.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:28.990
Bob, come on. Let's go.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.729
Are you all right?

01:05:36.765 --> 01:05:39.198
This is my last trip home.

01:05:50.244 --> 01:05:52.210
It's not getting any better.

01:05:52.212 --> 01:05:55.112
You don't have to tell me.

01:05:55.114 --> 01:05:56.680
I can see.

01:05:56.682 --> 01:05:58.448
It's still there.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.149
Right there.

01:06:00.151 --> 01:06:03.285
The anger. The fear.

01:06:03.487 --> 01:06:06.554
You are not
a very good student.

01:06:06.556 --> 01:06:09.490
Life is trying to teach you,

01:06:09.492 --> 01:06:11.158
but you don't listen.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.827
Opportunities come
and you don't see them.

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:17.530
What are you talking about?
I did exactly what you said.

01:06:17.532 --> 01:06:20.799
I went to Detroit.
I went 2,000 miles.

01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:22.100
I saw my parents.

01:06:22.102 --> 01:06:24.769
I did not tell you
to see your parents.

01:06:24.771 --> 01:06:28.405
I just said
you needed to forgive.

01:06:28.407 --> 01:06:32.142
There is only one place
you need to go.

01:06:33.712 --> 01:06:34.977
Where?

01:06:34.979 --> 01:06:36.545
Your heart.

01:06:40.817 --> 01:06:43.150
Great. My heart.

01:06:45.154 --> 01:06:47.921
How exactly does one get there?

01:06:49.724 --> 01:06:52.991
Feel in the center
of your chest.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:56.126
Imagine your finger
pushing into it,

01:06:56.128 --> 01:06:58.094
deeper and deeper.

01:06:58.096 --> 01:06:59.962
When you start to feel happy,

01:06:59.964 --> 01:07:03.532
you feel a sense of well-being,

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.466
you are there.

01:07:05.468 --> 01:07:08.302
That is the place of love

01:07:08.304 --> 01:07:10.404
and forgiveness.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.608
Go there. Soon.

01:07:18.045 --> 01:07:23.048
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:28.953
<i>¶ You may see a stranger</i>

01:07:30.222 --> 01:07:33.223
I'm seeing Dr. Mills tomorrow.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:37.426
I'm seeing Dr. Mills tomorrow.
I'm having the ultrasound.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.828
Just wanted to let you know.

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:42.163
Oh. Okay.

01:07:42.165 --> 01:07:45.933
<i>¶ You know even then</i>

01:07:45.935 --> 01:07:50.237
<i>¶ That somewhere</i>
<i>you'll see her again and again</i>

01:07:50.239 --> 01:07:52.272
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:07:56.044 --> 01:07:57.376
Nice tune.

01:07:58.512 --> 01:08:02.714
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>

01:08:03.283 --> 01:08:07.852
<i>¶ Someone may be laughing</i>

01:08:07.854 --> 01:08:13.324
<i>¶ You may hear her laughing</i>
<i>across a crowded room ¶</i>

01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:18.095
Does he belong to you? I found
him wandering in the hall.

01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:21.064
Bob.

01:08:21.066 --> 01:08:23.733
What are you doing here?

01:08:24.202 --> 01:08:26.502
I was in
the neighborhood, so...

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.671
I can't believe it. I...

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:32.407
I can't believe you came.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.875
Come here.

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:38.611
Oh, honey, thanks.

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:42.113
Are you changing
in your old age?

01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:48.519
Mr. Jones, I presume? Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Dr. Mills.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.620
Hi. How are you?

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:50.787
How are you, Gail?

01:08:50.788 --> 01:08:51.854
Oh, I'm fine.

01:08:51.856 --> 01:08:56.959
Okay. Let's take a look at this
baby with the ultrasound machine.

01:08:57.428 --> 01:08:58.894
It's been really active.

01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:01.863
Perfectly normal.
This will be a little cold.

01:09:01.865 --> 01:09:03.029
"A little cold"?

01:09:03.032 --> 01:09:07.934
Sorry. Would you like me
to videotape this for you?

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.649
Yeah. Can you do that?

01:09:12.538 --> 01:09:13.703
Oh, wow.

01:09:13.706 --> 01:09:16.273
Home movies before you're born.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:21.978
Well, what do you think?

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:24.747
What a beautiful profile.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:27.548
Oh, my God.

01:09:28.484 --> 01:09:31.051
Oh, that's the heart.

01:09:31.553 --> 01:09:32.484
Where?

01:09:32.487 --> 01:09:34.386
There. You see it?

01:09:34.554 --> 01:09:37.421
That is a gorgeous baby.

01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:42.325
This is all very good.

01:09:42.327 --> 01:09:44.026
You're in your 27th week,

01:09:44.028 --> 01:09:46.395
and your baby's
right on schedule.

01:09:46.397 --> 01:09:48.729
Look, it's sucking its thumb.

01:09:48.732 --> 01:09:51.332
- That's what it's doing?
- Yeah.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:54.267
- My, oh, my.
- Look at that.

01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:57.003
Do you wanna know
the baby's sex?

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:01.106
Yeah. Right?

01:10:01.174 --> 01:10:02.006
Yeah.

01:10:02.008 --> 01:10:03.407
You have a son.

01:10:03.976 --> 01:10:06.710
A beautiful,
healthy-looking son.

01:10:06.712 --> 01:10:08.478
Oh, my God!

01:10:08.947 --> 01:10:10.246
Really?

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.281
How you know that?

01:10:12.283 --> 01:10:15.083
Either that
or he's got three legs.

01:10:18.421 --> 01:10:19.887
Geez.

01:10:22.758 --> 01:10:24.424
A son.

01:10:31.599 --> 01:10:33.899
Geez, what are we gonna name him?
Did we even think of that?

01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:35.767
Mom wants to name him
after her father.

01:10:35.769 --> 01:10:38.269
I'm drinking for two. Thanks.

01:10:39.972 --> 01:10:42.272
Zachary? Are you crazy?

01:10:42.274 --> 01:10:43.573
Zack.

01:10:43.575 --> 01:10:46.976
Not me. No son of mine
is gonna be named Zack.

01:10:46.978 --> 01:10:49.445
He'll get killed at school.

01:10:49.447 --> 01:10:51.747
What else starts with a Z?

01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:53.347
Zeus?

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.649
Uh, Prometheus.

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:58.318
Prometheus has a ring to it.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.552
Uh, Agamemnon.

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:00.754
Oh, cute.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:01.955
Odysseus.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:02.522
Uh...

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:06.492
Forget the Greeks. Let's try
something, uh, Roman. Try Romans.

01:11:06.494 --> 01:11:08.560
Roman, Roman... Julius.

01:11:08.562 --> 01:11:10.895
Julius. Augustus. Augie.

01:11:10.897 --> 01:11:12.663
Augie!

01:11:12.765 --> 01:11:13.930
Jehoshaphat.

01:11:13.932 --> 01:11:15.097
Something thinner.

01:11:15.099 --> 01:11:16.698
Uh, Anorexis.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.332
That's a girl's name.

01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:20.901
I didn't even know
that was a name.

01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:22.369
All right, uh, Morton.

01:11:22.371 --> 01:11:24.571
Morton? That's terrible.

01:11:24.573 --> 01:11:25.471
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:11:25.473 --> 01:11:28.006
That was
a spontaneous emission,

01:11:28.008 --> 01:11:29.607
so to speak.

01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:57.367
You sure you want to do this?

01:11:57.469 --> 01:11:59.168
I'm sure.

01:11:59.336 --> 01:12:02.603
You're an amazing woman,
you know that?

01:12:03.472 --> 01:12:06.206
I must be. I live with you.

01:12:06.474 --> 01:12:08.841
Am I really that difficult?

01:12:09.343 --> 01:12:11.443
Some things
you don't want to know.

01:12:17.484 --> 01:12:19.183
I love you.

01:12:20.953 --> 01:12:22.852
I love you, too.

01:12:53.885 --> 01:12:55.150
Please, follow your shot.

01:12:55.152 --> 01:12:57.085
Once you get in, box out.

01:12:57.087 --> 01:12:59.687
What do you do? Pump fake.

01:12:59.689 --> 01:13:01.055
Right. That way
you draw the foul.

01:13:01.057 --> 01:13:02.456
We have a lot of work
to do, tomorrow.

01:13:02.458 --> 01:13:05.959
We'll talk about boxing out
the man for the rebound.

01:13:06.995 --> 01:13:09.028
Now, cooking spaghetti.

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.962
Boil some water.

01:13:09.964 --> 01:13:11.563
Salt it. Maybe
a little olive oil.

01:13:11.565 --> 01:13:13.298
Slide the noodles in.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.000
You want them soft,
but not too soft.

01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:17.301
Okay?

01:13:17.736 --> 01:13:19.068
Now...

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.503
Cooking in college.

01:13:21.505 --> 01:13:24.138
Probably own one pot, right?

01:13:27.076 --> 01:13:28.708
There you go, babe.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:32.712
There are basically two
schools of shaving, okay?

01:13:32.714 --> 01:13:34.647
Down, like that,

01:13:34.649 --> 01:13:36.815
or up, like that.

01:13:36.817 --> 01:13:42.620
Never, I repeat, never
sideways, like that. No.

01:13:45.891 --> 01:13:48.691
Oh, a Raiders cap!

01:13:49.093 --> 01:13:49.825
Oh, and look!

01:13:49.827 --> 01:13:53.094
It's not for you, Bob.
Cutest little Raiders jacket.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:54.962
Oh, that's adorable!

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.698
Thanks, guys. Wait a minute.
Look what else is in there.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:58.432
What?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.100
Oh, this, a jock.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:03.503
That's so sweet.

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:07.273
Now let's try the same
breathing on our side.

01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:08.173
Everyone turn over.

01:14:08.175 --> 01:14:12.410
Daddies, this is a good time
to practice your massage.

01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:16.813
Okay, now, daddies.
Keep it gentle but firm.

01:14:16.815 --> 01:14:20.383
Very good.
Right on the lower back.

01:14:21.319 --> 01:14:22.551
Good.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.419
Is it working?

01:14:25.421 --> 01:14:26.620
No.

01:14:26.622 --> 01:14:28.788
Oh, just what I needed to hear.

01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:31.890
Do you want me to stop?

01:14:31.892 --> 01:14:33.291
No.

01:14:33.293 --> 01:14:35.860
Careful. Don't hyperventilate.

01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:39.563
So, tell me, is this breathing
all a load of crap?

01:14:39.565 --> 01:14:42.432
Well, you know,

01:14:42.434 --> 01:14:45.668
it's better than screaming.

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:48.137
Oh. Great.

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:57.443
Hurry. The line's not too long.

01:14:57.445 --> 01:14:58.977
It's been over 30 years.

01:14:58.979 --> 01:15:01.446
It's time I tried it
again, I think.

01:15:01.448 --> 01:15:04.048
Well, maybe you should
start on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:04.648
No, no, no.

01:15:04.650 --> 01:15:08.151
I'm going right into the core
of fear, the heart of darkness.

01:15:08.153 --> 01:15:10.253
Wish I could go with you.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:13.456
Some things you just
gotta do alone, hon.

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:21.096
Good luck.

01:15:45.187 --> 01:15:47.487
You ever been
on a coaster before?

01:15:47.489 --> 01:15:50.857
Not since I was six.
I've been too afraid.

01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:52.624
You're kidding.

01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:54.826
And now you pick "the Serpent"?

01:15:54.828 --> 01:15:58.362
If you really wanna
do it right, let go.

01:15:58.964 --> 01:15:59.896
You crazy?

01:15:59.898 --> 01:16:02.565
You won't fall out. Trust me.

01:16:02.567 --> 01:16:05.935
This is what I trust.
Right here.

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.436
Yeah!

01:16:15.177 --> 01:16:16.776
Yeah!

01:16:30.057 --> 01:16:31.122
How much more?

01:16:31.124 --> 01:16:34.125
Plenty! Ha ha!

01:16:34.794 --> 01:16:36.760
But... Oh!

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:49.939
Just a few more drops,
but really great ones!

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.520
You can let go now.

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.957
My hero.

01:17:15.595 --> 01:17:17.328
Hey, you did it.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:18.662
A snap.

01:17:18.664 --> 01:17:21.765
Here you go. Thanks. Thanks.

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:27.737
You know what today is?

01:17:27.739 --> 01:17:28.804
No. What?

01:17:28.806 --> 01:17:29.905
D-Day.

01:17:29.907 --> 01:17:31.306
"D-Day"?

01:17:32.809 --> 01:17:34.542
It's death day.

01:17:36.345 --> 01:17:38.945
I was supposed
to be dead by today.

01:17:40.214 --> 01:17:41.746
Oh, Bob.

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:46.083
We're living on borrowed time.

01:18:52.784 --> 01:18:56.252
Okay, now, the important thing to
remember about jumping another car

01:18:56.254 --> 01:18:59.288
is to put the cables
in the right place.

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:01.623
Positive to positive.
Negative to negative.

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:05.126
Or you can ground it here by
putting it on metal. Okay?

01:19:05.128 --> 01:19:08.028
And don't go goofing around with these things.
Okay? They're not toys.

01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:10.797
All right? You don't, you
know, put 'em together,

01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:12.632
they make some pretty cool
sparks, but don't do that.

01:19:12.634 --> 01:19:15.534
Don't goose your buddies with
'em or anything like that.

01:19:15.536 --> 01:19:16.368
Just ask your Uncle Paul.

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:19.504
Ask him about the time
we were playing Frankenstein.

01:19:22.742 --> 01:19:24.241
Sex.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.250
Walking into a room,

01:19:34.252 --> 01:19:36.619
correct way and the wrong way.

01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:37.453
Correct way. With confidence,

01:19:37.455 --> 01:19:40.422
right to the person
you're about to address.

01:19:40.724 --> 01:19:43.825
"Tom. Brian. Brian Jones."

01:19:43.827 --> 01:19:45.359
Right there, okay?

01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:45.992
One line.

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:48.627
You can even start the handshake
up here if you want to.

01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:51.463
You can go that early
if you want to.

01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:53.063
Never.

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.003
"Oh, hi."

01:20:00.005 --> 01:20:01.237
Never. Okay?

01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:04.039
Now, if you can do this...

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:06.708
"Hi, Brian. Brian Jones."

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:09.010
Do it. But ever since Cary
Grant and Fred Astaire died,

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:12.079
there are very few guys
who can pull that off.

01:20:15.117 --> 01:20:16.549
Bob?

01:20:16.617 --> 01:20:18.249
Huh? It's time.

01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:19.083
What?

01:20:19.085 --> 01:20:20.918
My contractions have started.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.852
I can't hear you. What?

01:20:21.854 --> 01:20:23.753
I'm having contractions.

01:20:23.755 --> 01:20:24.620
Your contraption, what?

01:20:24.622 --> 01:20:28.457
We're having a baby. Now?

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:33.995
Oh, damn! What are you doing?

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.396
I forgot the camera. Oh.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:37.131
This is great. That's it.

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:40.601
Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay, okay. How you doin'?
Good. That's it.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.369
Can you turn this way
a little, honey?

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:45.839
Turn that fucking thing off!

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:51.510
Oh. I love you.

01:20:51.512 --> 01:20:53.412
I love you so much.

01:20:53.414 --> 01:20:56.882
Oh. How's that?

01:20:56.884 --> 01:21:00.919
Oh, great. Ooh, I... Ah.

01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:02.720
It's coming. Oh, my back!

01:21:02.722 --> 01:21:05.155
You okay? You all right? Yeah.

01:21:05.157 --> 01:21:07.991
Okay. Remember,
breathe, honey, breathe.

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:09.892
That's it. Relax.

01:21:09.894 --> 01:21:11.460
Relax. Just go with it.
Just go with it.

01:21:11.462 --> 01:21:14.863
Let it happen. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Oh, I can't. It hurts.

01:21:14.865 --> 01:21:17.732
Relax. Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

01:21:17.734 --> 01:21:21.268
Breathe, breathe, breathe, relax.
That's it.

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:24.104
Shut up!
Okay, all right. Sorry.

01:21:24.106 --> 01:21:27.273
- How's everyone doin'?
- I don't know.

01:21:27.275 --> 01:21:29.775
Ah, yeah.

01:21:29.777 --> 01:21:33.445
- Hi, Gail.
- Oh. Mmm.

01:21:33.914 --> 01:21:36.147
How we doin'?
Well, everything's fine,

01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:38.916
but her contractions
are getting further apart.

01:21:38.918 --> 01:21:40.918
We need for them
to be closer together

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.686
and more regular to make progress.
Right.

01:21:42.688 --> 01:21:45.422
I'd like to start pitocin,
which will increase

01:21:45.424 --> 01:21:46.656
the strength and frequency
of the contractions.

01:21:46.658 --> 01:21:48.591
Good idea. Good idea. Increase?
What do you mean, increase?

01:21:48.593 --> 01:21:50.559
Are you crazy? What are you talking...
Are you nuts?

01:21:50.561 --> 01:21:52.928
It'll speed things along.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:53.895
It's gonna speed it up, honey.

01:21:53.897 --> 01:21:57.298
Doc says it's just gonna
speed it up. Okay.

01:21:59.168 --> 01:22:01.535
Hey, Doctor! How do you
think it's goin' in there?

01:22:01.537 --> 01:22:04.471
Everything's just fine. No, seriously.
How do you think it's goin'?

01:22:04.473 --> 01:22:07.173
Everything's just fine. Yeah?

01:22:07.175 --> 01:22:10.643
Go back in. Help her relax.
Okay.

01:22:17.984 --> 01:22:20.884
Oh, I love you, honey.
I love you so much.

01:22:20.886 --> 01:22:21.885
- Bob, grab your camera.
- What?

01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:27.257
The baby's head is crowning. How often
do you get to see your baby being born?

01:22:28.059 --> 01:22:29.425
- Can you hold her?
- Sure.

01:22:29.427 --> 01:22:31.360
Okay, Gail.

01:22:31.362 --> 01:22:36.798
I know that it hurts, I know that it's
hard, but I know you can do this.

01:22:36.933 --> 01:22:38.866
Oh, God!

01:22:41.604 --> 01:22:45.072
Ahhh! The head is out.

01:22:45.074 --> 01:22:47.107
Whoa!

01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:49.642
What about, uh...

01:22:49.644 --> 01:22:51.710
You know... The rest?

01:22:51.712 --> 01:22:55.513
Last time. I promise. No more than this.
We're almost there.

01:22:55.515 --> 01:22:57.982
I'll need you to push one more time.
Where's the baby? What?

01:22:57.984 --> 01:23:00.417
Push one more time. We have to
get this baby out. Not one more.

01:23:00.419 --> 01:23:02.552
Yes, one more time. You can do it.
Not one more.

01:23:02.554 --> 01:23:03.486
No, I don't have...
Honey, I can't!

01:23:03.488 --> 01:23:04.587
Come on, honey. Yes, you can.

01:23:04.589 --> 01:23:06.155
I know you can, come on.
You're doing marvelously well.

01:23:06.157 --> 01:23:08.090
Push one more time.
Come on. Yes, you can.

01:23:08.092 --> 01:23:10.859
Yeah, you can.
You're doin' so great.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:13.027
Oh, I need to...

01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:16.563
Oh! One more. Just one more.

01:23:16.565 --> 01:23:19.365
Ah. One more.

01:23:32.012 --> 01:23:34.212
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

01:23:34.214 --> 01:23:37.448
Oh, my God.

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:40.317
Where's the baby? Where is he?

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:42.552
Oh!

01:23:42.554 --> 01:23:45.187
Here's your handsome son.

01:23:45.756 --> 01:23:47.956
Oh, hello!

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:50.992
Hello, little one.

01:23:50.994 --> 01:23:54.195
Yes. Oh.

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:57.530
Sweetheart.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:00.099
You're so beautiful.

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:03.969
We have a baby.

01:24:04.338 --> 01:24:07.072
Grab your camera.

01:24:07.474 --> 01:24:10.775
Oh.

01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:13.744
Hey.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.647
Here we are. Oh! Sorry, hon! Oh!

01:24:17.649 --> 01:24:21.417
Oh, sorry.
Here, could you do this?

01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:26.855
Look through the thing
and just get my kid, my wife.

01:24:26.857 --> 01:24:28.923
- Kid, wife.
- You did great.

01:24:28.925 --> 01:24:33.994
Thanks. Oh, her.
Oh, you did great.

01:24:33.996 --> 01:24:36.029
You did great. Hi, sweetie.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.032
Oh.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:43.334
He's gorgeous!

01:24:44.804 --> 01:24:47.371
Thank you.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.155
- Come on.
- Oh, good burp.

01:25:08.225 --> 01:25:11.659
He's drunk.

01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:14.294
Been drinking.

01:25:15.864 --> 01:25:17.763
Honey, he's just eaten.
He's gonna throw up.

01:25:17.765 --> 01:25:19.931
No, no, no, no. He likes it.

01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:23.234
Yeah. You like
your daddy, don't you?

01:25:30.242 --> 01:25:32.275
Oops! What's that
you're puttin' on him?

01:25:32.277 --> 01:25:34.010
It's just the soap.
Take it easy.

01:25:34.012 --> 01:25:37.279
All right.
Ooh, ow, ooh! Yikes! Gee!

01:25:37.281 --> 01:25:42.884
Easy! Easy there! Oh! Yo!

01:25:43.319 --> 01:25:46.253
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:46.255 --> 01:25:48.321
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:48.323 --> 01:25:50.189
Here we go. Okay. Come on.

01:25:50.191 --> 01:25:51.190
Shit!

01:25:51.192 --> 01:25:53.392
Bob. Sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

01:25:53.394 --> 01:25:53.959
Yeah.

01:25:53.961 --> 01:25:55.694
Here we go. Smile. Smile.
Is he smiling?

01:25:55.696 --> 01:25:57.162
One more. He's smiling.
Okay. Yeah!

01:25:57.164 --> 01:25:58.062
Damn!

01:25:58.064 --> 01:26:02.132
Honey. Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. Here we go.

01:26:02.134 --> 01:26:03.933
Get ready.

01:26:03.935 --> 01:26:07.436
Okay. Okay. Okay. Ready?

01:26:08.071 --> 01:26:10.037
Did it click? I didn't hear it.

01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:12.439
The red light on?

01:26:12.441 --> 01:26:14.207
Aw. Aw!

01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:16.042
Sweetie, your hand.
I can't see his face.

01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:18.644
Oh, sorry. Put it
in the other hand.

01:26:18.646 --> 01:26:20.646
Wait a minute. Right. Yeah.

01:26:20.648 --> 01:26:22.681
Oh. Oh. You can't... Oh.

01:26:22.683 --> 01:26:26.251
I'm sorry. Here. Wait.
Gimme... Okay.

01:26:26.253 --> 01:26:29.320
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about that.

01:26:29.322 --> 01:26:31.922
Here. If this makes you
feel any better, there.

01:26:31.924 --> 01:26:35.825
How's that? Now we're even.

01:26:35.927 --> 01:26:39.295
<i>¶ Da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da</i>

01:26:39.297 --> 01:26:42.865
<i>¶ Da-da-da-da Whoo! ¶</i>

01:27:06.122 --> 01:27:07.354
Bobbie!

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:12.359
You gonna take every second
of this baby's life?

01:27:12.427 --> 01:27:16.829
Too much. You're a scallywag,
that's what you are.

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.430
Say, "Bye, Daddy. Bye."

01:27:23.169 --> 01:27:24.735
See? See how he can go around there?
You watching?

01:27:24.737 --> 01:27:27.938
See, you can do that. Here, wait, wait, wait.
Gonna stop this thing. There.

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:33.109
Right there. Right where that kid's feet go.
Right there, one in front of the other.

01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:34.677
Watch, Brian. One. See?

01:27:34.679 --> 01:27:39.048
Now one... Go ahead, do it. One
in front of the other. Go, go.

01:27:44.055 --> 01:27:48.057
You think he'll sleep? Oh, yeah.
He's exhausted.

01:27:48.059 --> 01:27:53.695
Yeah? Look at him.
I don't get it.

01:27:54.431 --> 01:27:55.496
Why's he so happy?

01:27:55.498 --> 01:27:59.433
It's not like he's got a Mercedes
and a great job or anything.

01:27:59.435 --> 01:28:03.036
Maybe he's just happy
being alive.

01:28:03.038 --> 01:28:06.572
Doesn't that make him some
kind of mutant or something?

01:28:06.574 --> 01:28:07.739
That makes him your son.

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:12.643
What does that mean?
He's learning it from you.

01:28:18.017 --> 01:28:19.883
I love you, Gail.

01:28:22.554 --> 01:28:25.054
I know.

01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:35.463
See you in the morning.
Go to sleep.

01:28:38.334 --> 01:28:40.967
Ah! Bob!

01:28:40.969 --> 01:28:43.436
I'm afraid the cancer
has spread to the brain.

01:28:43.438 --> 01:28:48.641
This is not uncommon with kidney cancer.
It's very opportunistic.

01:28:48.643 --> 01:28:52.611
The miracle is that you've
managed to survive this long.

01:28:52.613 --> 01:28:56.348
I don't know what has kept you
alive, but a man in your condition

01:28:56.350 --> 01:29:00.218
should not be sitting
across from me right now.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:05.456
Traditionally, a brain tumor of
this size progresses very quickly.

01:29:05.458 --> 01:29:10.194
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

01:29:10.429 --> 01:29:13.830
There is really
very little time left.

01:29:17.869 --> 01:29:20.069
What, a month?

01:29:20.071 --> 01:29:23.005
Two? With luck.

01:29:23.273 --> 01:29:25.473
We can hospitalize you
if you wish, but in truth,

01:29:25.475 --> 01:29:28.242
hospice care can be
equally effective

01:29:28.244 --> 01:29:31.578
and you can stay in the
comfort of your own home.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.213
I'll be happy to recommend
a service for you.

01:29:34.215 --> 01:29:39.518
I should warn you that you will
probably develop muscle weakness.

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.455
Walking and lifting things may
become difficult for you.

01:29:43.457 --> 01:29:47.625
That's why it's a good idea to
have professional help around.

01:29:47.627 --> 01:29:51.395
I'd also like
to begin a series...

01:30:05.811 --> 01:30:08.411
That light.

01:30:09.313 --> 01:30:11.413
I keep seeing that light.

01:30:11.415 --> 01:30:14.716
What is it?
Why do I keep seeing it?

01:30:14.718 --> 01:30:17.952
That is the light of the self.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:20.020
It is the source of life,

01:30:20.022 --> 01:30:23.890
the source of all healing.

01:30:23.892 --> 01:30:26.959
Does that mean it's working?

01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:29.895
Can it heal my tumor?

01:30:31.431 --> 01:30:34.165
It's going too fast.

01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:38.702
So there isn't anything?

01:30:38.704 --> 01:30:41.271
What can I do?

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:48.677
Put your house in order.

01:30:51.748 --> 01:30:54.381
Find peace.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:58.117
Oh, shit!

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.886
Ow!

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.154
Would someone get that?

01:31:07.294 --> 01:31:09.894
Mom, can you get the door?

01:31:20.372 --> 01:31:25.341
Does anybody hear that?

01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:29.778
Come on. That... Oh.

01:31:32.849 --> 01:31:35.649
Well, no need to ask
who the patient is.

01:31:35.651 --> 01:31:38.018
You're Bob, I assume? Yeah.

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:41.421
And you're the wife. Are you Gail?
Yeah, I'm Gail.

01:31:41.423 --> 01:31:45.892
I'm Theresa, the hospice nurse.
Dr. Altman referred me?

01:31:45.894 --> 01:31:47.760
Oh, yeah. Can I come in?

01:31:47.762 --> 01:31:50.696
Yeah. Sure.

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:58.936
We're gonna need
a walker, aren't we?

01:31:58.938 --> 01:32:01.171
I'll bring one over
this afternoon.

01:32:01.173 --> 01:32:03.373
Now, Dr. Altman
filled me in on everything.

01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:08.678
I just want you to know we're gonna
help you in every way we can.

01:32:16.087 --> 01:32:18.020
There we go. You got it. See?

01:32:18.022 --> 01:32:21.390
Balance, lift, step.
Don't forget.

01:32:23.293 --> 01:32:24.191
Hey, this is hard.

01:32:24.193 --> 01:32:27.093
Nobody said Olympic
training was gonna be easy.

01:32:27.095 --> 01:32:28.561
Come on. You can do it.

01:32:28.563 --> 01:32:31.931
You're doin' fine.
Just take your time.

01:32:56.057 --> 01:32:58.090
No. Come on now. None of that.

01:32:58.092 --> 01:33:03.161
We'll just lay you down in the
den, that's all. No big deal.

01:33:04.564 --> 01:33:07.164
All right, that'll do it. That's
all there is to it. Thanks.

01:33:07.166 --> 01:33:10.033
Thanks. I'll show you out.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:11.634
Bye.

01:33:49.406 --> 01:33:51.172
I want him in my bed.

01:33:51.174 --> 01:33:54.742
You can stay
with him downstairs.

01:33:55.711 --> 01:33:59.612
It's not the same. I know.

01:34:03.985 --> 01:34:06.585
Oh, Mom.

01:34:14.995 --> 01:34:20.164
So this friend of mine
introduces me to your mother.

01:34:20.166 --> 01:34:22.533
And at first,

01:34:22.535 --> 01:34:25.936
nothing in me responded to her.

01:34:26.405 --> 01:34:30.206
Maybe I was intimidated
by how beautiful she was.

01:34:30.775 --> 01:34:32.975
I kept saying to myself,

01:34:32.977 --> 01:34:36.011
"She's too tall, too skinny.

01:34:36.013 --> 01:34:39.948
"She knows too much
about public relations."

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.784
But she had, uh,

01:34:42.786 --> 01:34:47.288
compassion,
and she was really open.

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:52.726
Even then, though,
I didn't think it was love.

01:34:53.095 --> 01:34:57.730
I just liked her.
I just really liked her.

01:35:00.401 --> 01:35:02.901
She made me feel good.

01:35:02.903 --> 01:35:07.605
And I felt whole, somehow.

01:35:09.308 --> 01:35:12.709
Then one day I woke up,

01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:15.912
and I realized,

01:35:18.016 --> 01:35:20.683
I love this woman.

01:35:21.452 --> 01:35:26.788
Just hit me. I just love her.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.328
So, I guess
what I've learned is,

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:41.334
liking someone is just as
important as loving them.

01:35:41.336 --> 01:35:46.472
And if you like somebody
long enough,

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:49.241
and enough enough,

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.510
you learn what love is, too.

01:35:57.083 --> 01:36:00.517
So... That's it.

01:36:00.952 --> 01:36:03.185
What do you think?

01:36:03.187 --> 01:36:07.923
I... I think
I'm gonna throw up.

01:36:08.892 --> 01:36:13.294
Really? Let me tell you about
this other girl in Detroit.

01:36:13.296 --> 01:36:15.896
You!

01:36:15.898 --> 01:36:19.232
Oh, sure. Now you
wanna kiss me.

<i>(WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE.</i>

01:36:33.847 --> 01:36:35.947
Bob, what are you doing?

01:36:35.949 --> 01:36:38.215
It's the middle of the night.

01:36:38.217 --> 01:36:39.783
You gotta get some sleep.

01:36:39.785 --> 01:36:43.653
I don't wanna go to sleep. What do
you mean you don't wanna sleep?

01:36:43.655 --> 01:36:47.156
Just try.
Uh-uh. I don't want to.

01:36:47.891 --> 01:36:51.359
Just a nap. How you
gonna keep your strength?

01:36:51.361 --> 01:36:53.961
Strength?

01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:56.763
I can't even brush my teeth.

01:36:56.765 --> 01:37:00.199
I know you're having trouble sleeping,
but could you turn it down a tad?

01:37:00.201 --> 01:37:03.435
Mom, in a little bit, okay?
He loves this part.

01:37:03.437 --> 01:37:06.638
I gotta start over.

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:22.785

Just let me say
something. Hold...

She wants to know if I
had any second opinions.

01:38:22.773 --> 01:38:28.176
Mom, I've had second opinions
about my second opinions.

01:38:28.178 --> 01:38:31.078
Lots of 'em. Listen.

something to you guys.

I never wanted to hurt you.

No, no, it wasn't you.
It was me.

Listen. You did
the best you could.

I'm doin' the best I can.

No. I wanna tell you something.

You never did anything wrong.

01:39:09.644 --> 01:39:14.647
It's okay. I wanted
you to know that.

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:18.883
Okay?

01:39:21.254 --> 01:39:23.320
They're crying.

01:39:23.322 --> 01:39:26.022
Give it to me.

Mom? Dad?

01:39:28.859 --> 01:39:30.758
Just listen to me.

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.997
Yeah. I know. Just call us back
when you know your flight number.

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.733
I know. We love you.

We'll talk to you
later this morning.

Okay. Bye.

01:39:50.143 --> 01:39:52.810
You did it.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.780
I know.

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:00.416
She's gonna fly.

01:40:00.418 --> 01:40:04.920
They're gonna have to
knock her out cold.

01:40:15.130 --> 01:40:18.064
Yeah. I got it. Whoa!

01:40:21.335 --> 01:40:23.301
Mom. Hi.

01:40:23.303 --> 01:40:25.002
You got in early, huh?

01:40:25.004 --> 01:40:28.905
Yep. Just put it all down here.

01:40:29.674 --> 01:40:33.075
Whoa. Oh, I'm so
glad you made it.

01:40:33.077 --> 01:40:36.078
- Us, too.
- It's a minor miracle.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.382
I just wanna warn you.
He's... He's weak.

01:40:41.651 --> 01:40:43.050
Okay.

Hey, Anya.

Oh, yeah. You feel all right?

01:41:41.869 --> 01:41:45.337
Yeah, you know. A little tired.

California. Like it?

01:42:00.718 --> 01:42:01.950
Well, hot.

01:42:01.952 --> 01:42:04.852
Hey.

01:42:05.187 --> 01:42:06.152
Check out your grandson.

01:42:06.154 --> 01:42:10.789
Oh. Oh, what a cute little baby!

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:14.392
- This is Brian.
- Oh!

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.261
Oh, Bobbie.

01:42:17.596 --> 01:42:18.528
He's so beautiful.

01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:21.197
Hug Grandma Rose. Oh,
you're so beautiful.

01:42:21.199 --> 01:42:22.965
- He's chunky.
- He looks strong!

01:42:22.967 --> 01:42:25.367
He looks just like Bobbie
when Bobbie was a baby.

01:42:25.369 --> 01:42:29.337
Yeah. He look like Bobbie.
Just look at you.

01:42:29.339 --> 01:42:31.372
I can't believe
you got on a plane.

01:42:31.374 --> 01:42:34.308
She was only conscious
for a part of it.

01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:38.679
Oh, never mind. They're
making fun of your grandma.

01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:41.648
Yeah. What?

01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:44.617
This is so great.

01:42:44.619 --> 01:42:46.885
I'm so happy you guys came.

01:42:48.321 --> 01:42:49.887
We all are.

01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:54.190
We all are.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.213
Gail. Bob.

01:43:19.215 --> 01:43:22.449
Get up. Hurry up.

01:43:28.089 --> 01:43:30.656
Hey, Paul, what's going on?

01:43:30.658 --> 01:43:33.358
You'll see.

01:43:36.495 --> 01:43:38.161
Okay.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:45.767
Hup! Whoo!

01:43:45.935 --> 01:43:48.669
Oh!

01:43:49.004 --> 01:43:51.371
Ah, hup! Hup!

01:43:51.373 --> 01:43:54.173
Aha! Ah, hup!

01:43:56.977 --> 01:43:59.444
What... What is this?
Who did this?

01:43:59.446 --> 01:44:02.814
Your parents. They
wanted to do something.

01:44:02.816 --> 01:44:06.284
Sometimes wishes come true.

01:44:15.294 --> 01:44:19.863
Better late than never.

01:44:25.303 --> 01:44:28.003
I love you, Bobbie.

01:44:35.278 --> 01:44:40.547
Toro, hup! No, no, down!
Hup! Hup! Hup!

01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:44.116
Where's Brian?

01:44:44.118 --> 01:44:46.685
Here you go.

01:44:59.065 --> 01:45:04.034
Don't forget this.
Don't ever forget this.

01:45:09.241 --> 01:45:12.542
Hey, Brian?

01:45:16.214 --> 01:45:18.948
I was just downstairs,

01:45:19.150 --> 01:45:22.718
thinkin' about some things.

01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:27.154
I thought
I'd come up here and...

01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:31.057
Have a talk with you,
man-to-man.

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:36.695
Listen.

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:40.598
This whole, uh, dying thing,

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.300
not my idea.

01:45:43.568 --> 01:45:48.037
Sometimes, stuff just happens.

01:45:51.275 --> 01:45:54.342
You know, my brother was right.

01:45:54.344 --> 01:45:59.046
I could've turned out
just like my father.

01:46:01.116 --> 01:46:03.716
He was really a good guy,

01:46:03.718 --> 01:46:08.620
but he worked all the time,
and he wasn't around too much.

01:46:12.926 --> 01:46:17.762
You would've spent
your whole life being angry.

01:46:18.765 --> 01:46:21.398
You don't wanna do that.

01:46:23.835 --> 01:46:26.869
You'd have never
known me, Brian.

01:46:27.071 --> 01:46:33.175
I don't want you
to feel bad about me dying.

01:46:35.746 --> 01:46:40.181
Dying's a really hard way
to learn about life.

01:46:40.616 --> 01:46:43.450
That's what happened.

01:46:49.324 --> 01:46:53.693
Boy, I'm so grateful

01:46:53.695 --> 01:46:57.363
for all this time
I've had with you.

01:46:57.865 --> 01:47:04.703
'Cause it's absolutely the
happiest I've ever, ever been.

01:47:11.878 --> 01:47:14.778
Nice to meet you, Brian.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.246
Good.

01:47:52.983 --> 01:47:54.749
One more? No, no more.

01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:58.519
No? Definitely not? Definitely.

01:47:59.855 --> 01:48:02.155
Okay.

01:48:10.565 --> 01:48:13.065
It's happening so fast.

01:48:13.067 --> 01:48:14.366
It's a blessing.

01:48:14.368 --> 01:48:19.003
Believe me, I've been around.
Now, let me take this.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:03.613
I love you, Dad.

01:49:06.184 --> 01:49:08.851
I love you, too.

01:49:43.753 --> 01:49:46.720
No.

01:49:49.424 --> 01:49:51.957
It's okay.

01:49:52.025 --> 01:49:56.427
It's okay.
You don't have to talk.

01:49:57.997 --> 01:50:00.664
I know.

01:50:01.099 --> 01:50:03.966
I know what's in your heart.

01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:08.637
It's okay.

01:50:08.872 --> 01:50:10.805
Shh. No.

01:50:23.286 --> 01:50:26.754
I love you.

01:50:26.989 --> 01:50:30.256
You're the love of my life.

01:50:43.104 --> 01:50:45.904
Bob?

01:50:46.606 --> 01:50:49.640
Bob?

01:50:49.708 --> 01:50:51.741
Bob?

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.366
<i>"Say!</i>

01:52:26.368 --> 01:52:29.102

01:52:45.519 --> 01:52:47.952

</i> That's right.

01:52:47.954 --> 01:52:49.853
<i>Gonna eat them on a tree
and in the car.</i> Dada.

01:52:49.855 --> 01:52:53.356
<i>We eat in the car sometimes, huh?
And in a tree?</i>

01:52:53.358 --> 01:52:57.193
<i>Can you imagine</i>

01:52:57.195 --> 01:52:59.195

01:52:59.197 --> 01:53:00.996
