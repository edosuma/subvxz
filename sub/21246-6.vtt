<i>JULIEN: We found something else on that tape.</i>

00:08.641 --> 00:12.201
Karl Sieg. They're members of a caid de cite.

00:12.361 --> 00:14.161
- Karl Sieg!

00:14.321 --> 00:15.401
He's in Brussels.

00:16.321 --> 00:18.161
<i>JULIEN: I know where Karl Sieg is.</i>

00:18.321 --> 00:21.321
ZIANE: <i>What do you want from me?</i>
MALIK: <i>What do you think I want from you?</i>

00:21.481 --> 00:24.761
- I want something I can use.
- I will give you what I can.

00:24.921 --> 00:27.001
Where were you the night Olly went missing?

00:27.161 --> 00:30.761
You are so sure there's nothing
you've done that you regret?

00:30.921 --> 00:32.201
Urgh!

<i>Hello, Mrs Hughes?</i>

01:30.721 --> 01:32.601
I am sorry not to have called sooner.

01:32.761 --> 01:34.761
We were pursuing a lead.

01:35.801 --> 01:37.761
I wanted to speak with you because...

01:39.921 --> 01:43.601
...I know you had some questions
you needed answering.

01:43.761 --> 01:44.961
Yes.

01:45.121 --> 01:47.601
<i>I believe I have the answers to these questions.</i>

01:48.561 --> 01:50.561
It is about Ian Garrett.

05:38.201 --> 05:40.961
- I've been waiting for hours.
- I'm sorry. There was um...

05:41.121 --> 05:44.521
- What happened?
- A big accident on the motorway, I'm sorry.

05:49.801 --> 05:51.681
Did you get my messages?

05:51.841 --> 05:53.601
<i>No.</i>

05:55.641 --> 05:57.441
Detective Baptiste called.

05:58.721 --> 06:01.561
He looked into Ian Garrett,
just like we asked him to.

06:01.721 --> 06:03.721
So he wasn't ignoring us.

06:06.441 --> 06:09.641
A security guard at Ian's office
saw him working late...

06:11.401 --> 06:13.521
...at the same time that Olly was taken.

06:14.961 --> 06:16.961
He said it couldn't be him.

06:18.081 --> 06:20.081
Ian Garrett didn't take our son.

08:27.001 --> 08:29.001
What do you drink?

08:29.921 --> 08:31.201
- Red wine.
- Red wine.

08:31.361 --> 08:32.400
A beer.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.001
It's a nice place.

08:48.121 --> 08:50.121
You want to buy it?

08:51.481 --> 08:56.561
Guaranteed to bleed your bank account dry
within a year or you get your money back.

08:59.201 --> 09:00.721
You are Karl Sieg?

09:05.401 --> 09:07.281
I am André Touloux.

09:07.441 --> 09:10.441
- You have me mistaken.
- Oh, please.

09:11.201 --> 09:13.481
Don't make me go through
the long and boring process

09:13.641 --> 09:16.441
of proving that which all of us here
already know.

09:21.801 --> 09:23.801
Mr Sieg.

09:28.001 --> 09:32.361
I want you to tell me everything you know
about a job you took in the summer of 2006

09:32.521 --> 09:34.401
in Châlons du Bois.

09:34.561 --> 09:38.681
A job which may have involved
the abduction of a boy called Oliver Hughes.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.361
I'm becoming an old man, you know.

09:47.281 --> 09:49.881
I can't remember what happened
two weeks ago.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.481
Perhaps that's why I've got three ex-wives

09:54.641 --> 09:56.521
and the bills that come with it.

09:56.681 --> 10:00.681
We have evidence that you were
outside the house where my son was taken.

10:03.521 --> 10:05.121
Did you see me there?

10:09.561 --> 10:11.001
Then I've nothing to tell you.

10:11.161 --> 10:15.001
Just pretend you knew something, anything.
What would it take for you to tell me?

10:15.161 --> 10:17.041
When I bought this place two years ago,

10:17.201 --> 10:22.321
I was convinced it would take care of itself
and it would see me through my retirement.

10:25.241 --> 10:29.521
I even thought I could save
and buy myself a nice new car...

10:31.161 --> 10:36.481
...maybe this second-hand Aston Martin
I had my eyes on.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.241
(Deep voice) Like James Bond.

10:40.401 --> 10:42.401
- You want money?
- Tony...

10:43.081 --> 10:45.201
Like a fish needs water, my friend.

10:45.361 --> 10:47.041
- How much?
- Please!

10:47.201 --> 10:48.281
How much?

10:48.441 --> 10:50.441
15,000.

10:51.761 --> 10:53.641
15,000 euros to keep this place afloat?

10:53.801 --> 10:56.081
No, my friend. That's for the Aston Martin.

10:56.241 --> 10:58.241
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

11:06.201 --> 11:08.201

lnspecteur Relaud.

11:58.681 --> 12:01.121
<i>Hi, it's Daniel Morgan from the IGC Lille office.</i>

12:01.281 --> 12:03.881
Just thought I should let you know
the permission finally came through

12:04.041 --> 12:06.321
on Ian Garrett's Audresselles property.

12:07.041 --> 12:10.721
<i>The embargo on development has expired.
I thought you should know.</i>

12:10.881 --> 12:12.761
- When do the works start?
- Today.

12:12.921 --> 12:14.921
Thank you for telling me.

12:39.201 --> 12:41.081
(Phone rings)

12:41.241 --> 12:42.801
<i>Mo, Laurence?</i>

13:10.081 --> 13:12.081
Where am I gonna get 15,000 euros?

13:13.521 --> 13:16.001
We will find a way through to Karl Sieg,
I promise you.

13:17.081 --> 13:19.561
But at this moment...l must leave.

13:20.961 --> 13:22.601
Why, is it your daughter?

13:23.721 --> 13:27.321
If I had any other choice, I wouldn't go.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

13:27.481 --> 13:29.281
Be patient.

13:59.721 --> 14:04.721
We found Mr Garrett's boat this morning, drifting
out at sea, but no sign of him anywhere.

14:05.921 --> 14:07.841
His car is still here. No one can reach him.

14:08.001 --> 14:09.881
LAURENCE: Do you think he fell?

14:10.041 --> 14:13.121
There have been lots of rains
out in the Channel, storms.

14:13.281 --> 14:15.281
So, yes, it's possible.

14:15.961 --> 14:17.961
But...we found something.

14:25.681 --> 14:27.561
These were on the boat.

14:27.721 --> 14:31.201
We couldn't watch them all,
it's more than a man could ever take.

14:31.361 --> 14:33.361
It's all sexual abuse of minors.

14:36.641 --> 14:38.081
MARK: Jesus.

14:38.241 --> 14:40.241
So what do you think?

14:40.721 --> 14:45.201
Perhaps someone found out who he was
and he tried to run, got into trouble at sea.

14:46.161 --> 14:49.641
Or perhaps someone wanted revenge
for the things he had done.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.641
Ian Garrett is a well-connected man.

14:52.801 --> 14:57.881
I was told that the press are not allowed to hear
a word of this until we have more information.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.201
Bien sûr.

15:24.881 --> 15:26.001
What?

15:26.761 --> 15:31.241
All of the concrete foundations here
have set properly, they are smooth and flat.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.401
All apart from this section here.

15:35.881 --> 15:39.321
I don't believe an architect
with a reputation like Mr Garrett

15:39.481 --> 15:41.961
would let such a thing happen in his own home.

15:50.081 --> 15:52.081
(Knock on door)

15:55.161 --> 15:59.041
EMILY: Everything all right?
MARK: Yeah, we just have a few questions.

15:59.201 --> 16:01.081
EMILY: Yes, please, come in.

16:01.241 --> 16:04.041
He's just in the bathroom, I'll just...

16:04.201 --> 16:06.081
- (Knock at door)
- Tony?

16:06.241 --> 16:07.561
Uh-huh?

16:10.921 --> 16:13.321
The police are here. They want to talk to us.

16:16.001 --> 16:17.521
Did they say why?

16:23.921 --> 16:25.761
What is it? Have you news about Olly?

16:26.961 --> 16:28.761
I am afraid not.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.201
We're here about Ian Garrett.

16:31.361 --> 16:33.441
Have you heard from him at all recently?

16:33.601 --> 16:35.401
Ian?

16:36.401 --> 16:38.241
I saw him a couple of days ago. Why?

16:38.401 --> 16:41.201
MARK: His yacht was found floating
on the ocean this morning.

16:42.041 --> 16:46.361
We've found no body so far
but we're assuming the worst.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.281
Right.

16:50.561 --> 16:52.441
I'm very sorry to hear that.

16:52.601 --> 16:54.601
But how do you think I can help?

16:55.641 --> 16:57.401
Where were you last night?

16:58.561 --> 17:00.441
LAURENCE: I am sorry but we must ask.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.161
Where was <i>I?</i>

17:03.761 --> 17:05.641
Just answer the question.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.800
I was erm...

17:09.040 --> 17:11.560
I went to pick up Emily at six from the station.

17:12.681 --> 17:15.441
She'd been back to England
to get some things from home.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.840
So I picked her up
and we went to dinner in Lille.

17:20.681 --> 17:22.681
Isn't that right, Em?

17:25.521 --> 17:27.521
JULIEN: Mrs Hughes?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.401
Mrs Hughes?

17:34.841 --> 17:36.721
Is this true?

17:36.881 --> 17:38.081
Yes.

17:38.241 --> 17:40.241
Yeah, yeah, erm...

17:41.001 --> 17:46.001
He picked me up at six and then we had
dinner and then we came back here.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.321
<i>OK.</i>

17:57.441 --> 18:01.561
Thank you for your patience -
we'll try not to bother you with this matter again.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.681
- Em...
- Don't you dare.

18:26.001 --> 18:28.001
- What do you think?
- (Phone rings)

18:29.801 --> 18:32.601
We know what he did to Vincent Bourg
and Greg Halpern.

18:32.761 --> 18:35.361
Emily? Covering for him?

18:35.521 --> 18:37.401
I don't buy it.

18:37.561 --> 18:39.681
I can look into the alibi more closely.

18:40.561 --> 18:43.241
And maybe we look at what's inside
that concrete.

18:43.401 --> 18:45.281
Excuse me.

18:45.441 --> 18:46.881
Celia?

18:47.041 --> 18:50.841
<i>You've got to come. It's Sara, she's in hospital.
Will you come?</i>

18:51.681 --> 18:53.881
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
<i>- Will</i> you?

18:54.041 --> 18:55.321
Yes.

18:55.481 --> 18:59.161
- Is everything all right?
- I'm afraid not. I have to go to London.

19:01.001 --> 19:03.001
(Reporters asks questions)

19:10.281 --> 19:14.681
I didn't want the police getting distracted,
so it was simpler if you confirmed where I was.

19:14.841 --> 19:17.961
- And they can focus on looking for Olly.
- We'd be going home today.

19:19.721 --> 19:21.201
What?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.121
Our holiday.

19:23.281 --> 19:25.361
We'd be sweeping the place up, packing.

19:25.521 --> 19:27.521
Well, I would be.

19:28.561 --> 19:30.441
You and Olly'd be in the pool.

19:30.601 --> 19:32.201
One last swim.

19:34.481 --> 19:38.001
You would've spent most of the week
in that pool, the two of you.

19:40.521 --> 19:42.641
He wouldn't ever have put his sun cream on.

19:42.801 --> 19:45.681
I'd have to tempt him out
by offering him ice cream.

19:50.201 --> 19:51.681
Em...

20:00.961 --> 20:02.401
Where were you?

20:02.561 --> 20:03.841
Don't.

20:04.001 --> 20:05.601
Just don't.

20:05.761 --> 20:07.641
I just lied for you.

20:07.801 --> 20:09.801
Tell me.

20:11.361 --> 20:13.361
Tell me the truth.

20:15.721 --> 20:17.601
You knew I had to go and see him.

20:17.761 --> 20:19.761
So stop playing dumb.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.041
It was an accident.

20:28.841 --> 20:32.041
I went down to the site
where he's building his new house.

20:32.921 --> 20:36.361
I saw his yacht, tied to the jetty...
I went inside, I found things.

20:36.521 --> 20:38.401
A camera.

20:38.561 --> 20:40.841
I watched the tape, Em, I saw...

20:42.921 --> 20:46.321
He was sick.
He hurt children, children like Olly.

20:46.481 --> 20:48.481
He even admitted to me what he was.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.361
He tried to fight me,
we struggled...it was an accident.

20:52.521 --> 20:53.961
But I thought he killed Olly.

20:54.121 --> 20:57.201
Tell me the world is not a better place
without monsters like Ian Garrett.

20:57.361 --> 20:59.041
- I can't be here.
- Em...

20:59.201 --> 21:00.721
Don't you dare touch me!

21:30.641 --> 21:32.641
(Reporters clamouring)

21:34.521 --> 21:36.521
Please speak to us!

21:39.401 --> 21:41.201
Madame Hughes?

22:11.001 --> 22:13.001
(Children babbling)

22:15.841 --> 22:17.841
(Speaks French)

22:21.081 --> 22:23.041
I didn't take you for a family man.

22:23.921 --> 22:25.401
You and my ex-wife.

22:29.121 --> 22:31.121
So, why are we meeting here?

22:32.041 --> 22:34.601
The fewer people who see us together,
the better.

22:34.761 --> 22:36.241
You do enough damage.

22:37.841 --> 22:40.201
So have they found out about our connection?

22:40.361 --> 22:42.041
Baptiste suspects.

22:42.201 --> 22:43.961
He wants me away from the Hughes case.

22:44.121 --> 22:47.481
So my career is... is finished.

22:49.281 --> 22:51.801
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No. No, you're not.

22:52.321 --> 22:54.801
You're sorry only
not to have a source any more.

22:58.081 --> 22:59.961
So you have a new job now, hm?

23:00.121 --> 23:02.121
A proper journalist in London.

23:04.121 --> 23:07.801
There will be other stories, other cases.
Why are you still here?

23:08.961 --> 23:11.041
Because this case is important to me.

23:14.281 --> 23:18.841
After my father died,
he left behind a lot of unfinished business.

23:20.241 --> 23:24.081
And in amongst it all, was a story
about an unsolved murder in Morocco

23:24.241 --> 23:26.241
and a name - Chamartaines.

23:29.801 --> 23:33.801
And when I saw you on the television
as part of the Hughes case...l knew.

23:35.441 --> 23:40.041
I just knew instantly
that I had been given an opportunity.

23:42.081 --> 23:46.681
You know, that I'd been given a chance
to follow in my father's footsteps.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.241
It was a sign.

23:50.401 --> 23:55.201
I was guided to this case
by forces out of my control.

23:57.001 --> 23:59.001
It's not over for me yet.

23:59.961 --> 24:01.961
I believe I have more to offer.

24:08.681 --> 24:12.481
Baptiste sent me to recanvass the crime scene
before he left for Paris.

24:12.641 --> 24:14.641
He wants me out of the way.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.641
But I found something.

24:19.641 --> 24:21.081
What?

24:29.081 --> 24:32.401
You have 24 hours
before I formally check it into evidence.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.841
And then we're finished.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.521
(Child complaining)

24:52.201 --> 24:53.601
<i>So.</i>

25:26.721 --> 25:29.121
The warrant to excavate Ian Garrett's house?

25:29.281 --> 25:30.841
Rejected.

25:31.001 --> 25:33.081
They say it is not enough to build a case,

25:33.241 --> 25:35.121
that it will never go to trial.

25:35.281 --> 25:37.161
No body, no case.

25:37.321 --> 25:39.401
What about the forensics, the tapes?

25:40.441 --> 25:43.361
Ian Garrett is a "friend to the department".

25:44.681 --> 25:48.601
He's having dinner with politicians,
he's godfather to their children.

25:48.761 --> 25:51.281
Dig too deep and they are scared
we find skeletons.

25:51.441 --> 25:53.801
And this makes them look bad, you understand?

25:54.281 --> 25:58.921
And you think that Georges will push to have it
rejected? I mean, it's the procurer's call, surely?

25:59.081 --> 26:03.001
I've heard that Ian Garrett is funding
his campaign for mayor next year.

26:03.161 --> 26:06.241
I am sure Baptiste
will take care of this on his return.

26:07.041 --> 26:10.521
But for now, there is an embargo
on touching Garrett's property.

26:10.681 --> 26:12.121
(Sighs)

26:29.361 --> 26:30.481
Olly!

26:32.601 --> 26:33.681
Olly!

26:43.961 --> 26:45.961
(Horns blare)

27:15.441 --> 27:17.321
What do you reckon?

27:17.481 --> 27:19.361
They're a bit pink.

27:19.521 --> 27:21.161
(Chuckles)

27:21.721 --> 27:26.001
I know I'm a woman and I'm supposed
to love them, but I've no idea about flowers.

27:26.161 --> 27:28.001
- Hello?
TONY: Em?

27:28.161 --> 27:30.041
<i>Hi, Em, it's me.</i>

27:30.201 --> 27:32.081
What do you want?

27:32.241 --> 27:33.961
These are better.

27:34.121 --> 27:35.921
<i>Sorry, I didn't know who else to call.</i>

27:36.641 --> 27:38.321
- I need money.
- Why?

27:38.481 --> 27:41.601
There's a man - he was at the scene,
at the house where Olly was taken.

27:41.761 --> 27:46.241
He says he'll talk to us, he'll tell us what
he knows...if we give him 15,000 euros.

27:46.401 --> 27:48.401
- What?
- <i>15,000 euros.</i>

27:49.921 --> 27:51.801
Well, who is he?

27:51.961 --> 27:53.841
<i>He was there, Em, he knows.</i>

27:54.001 --> 27:55.561
And how do you know that he...

27:55.721 --> 27:57.601
<i>Em, if you really care...</i>

27:57.761 --> 27:59.641
How dare you?

27:59.801 --> 28:01.681
How dare you? How dare you say that?

28:01.841 --> 28:03.721
Like you're the only one?

28:03.881 --> 28:05.761
<i>Isn't he worth it?</i>

28:05.921 --> 28:08.241
I've got to get off. I'll have a think about it.

28:12.401 --> 28:13.961
What did he want?

28:14.121 --> 28:16.121
Him and Julien, they...

28:18.441 --> 28:20.321
...they've found someone,

28:20.481 --> 28:25.401
a suspect and they can place him
where Olly was kept, but...

28:26.481 --> 28:28.761
...he won't talk, not unless they pay him.

28:30.201 --> 28:31.681
How much?

28:34.001 --> 28:35.601
15,000 euros.

28:37.401 --> 28:40.001
For information you have no idea is any good?

28:40.161 --> 28:42.161
Is he nuts?

28:44.561 --> 28:46.561
You're thinking of paying?

28:52.081 --> 28:53.961
We don't have 15,000 euros, Em.

28:54.121 --> 28:55.921
We don't.

28:56.081 --> 28:58.081
Yes, we do.

29:24.321 --> 29:26.481
JULIEN: Has the area been excavated yet?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.761
Well, we just started working two hours ago.

29:30.081 --> 29:32.961
Well, I imagine Mr Garrett
kept this site very clean.

29:33.121 --> 29:37.201
He was a great man. I hope something turns up
that might help you find him.

29:41.761 --> 29:43.761
(Phone rings)

29:45.601 --> 29:47.001
<i>Mo?</i>

30:12.161 --> 30:13.841
Her child is unwell.

30:14.001 --> 30:16.001
We'll continue.

31:11.041 --> 31:13.041
(Email alert)

31:50.361 --> 31:51.841
(Sobs)

32:22.641 --> 32:24.641
(Pneumatic drill pounds)

33:20.561 --> 33:22.561
(Drilling starts up again)

33:47.041 --> 33:50.001
The doctor says she needs to rest.

33:52.561 --> 33:54.601
They asked about her addiction.

33:54.761 --> 33:56.761
She has damage to her kidneys...

33:59.361 --> 34:02.481
...which they say that they can treat
if she stays clean.

34:03.561 --> 34:07.961
But if she carries on the way she is,
he says that...

34:09.321 --> 34:11.321
...it's most likely that she'll die.

34:12.241 --> 34:13.960
(Sobs)

34:37.201 --> 34:38.601
Dad?

34:38.761 --> 34:40.201
Ssh.

36:21.321 --> 36:23.321
(Police radio static crackles)

36:24.961 --> 36:28.081
If we need anything else, we'll contact you.
Thank you.

36:33.001 --> 36:34.521
Officers?

37:29.881 --> 37:31.441
Emily?

37:41.041 --> 37:42.761
(Panting)

37:46.081 --> 37:48.081
I've got you. I've got you.

37:53.001 --> 37:55.001
I was just following him.

37:56.881 --> 37:58.761
I was just following Olly.

37:58.921 --> 38:00.641
I've got you.

38:39.441 --> 38:41.441
- (Knock at door)
- What?

38:45.921 --> 38:47.561
Yeah?

38:59.121 --> 39:00.801
Em?

39:06.401 --> 39:09.361
I would've come anyway.
You didn't have to send the video.

39:11.001 --> 39:13.081
I don't want to think of him like that.

39:18.441 --> 39:20.441
Now I keep seeing him in that house.

39:23.441 --> 39:25.521
Seeing him scared, and desperate...

39:29.121 --> 39:31.121
...and seeing that man.

39:36.081 --> 39:37.961
I would've come anyway.

39:38.121 --> 39:40.121
Would you?

39:45.041 --> 39:50.201
I was hoping to get here earlier, but withdrawing
15,000 euros, people ask a lot of questions,

39:50.361 --> 39:52.361
like what I was using it for.

39:56.241 --> 39:58.241
I told them it was for my son.

40:24.321 --> 40:26.201
- Mrs Hughes.
- Julien, hi.

40:26.361 --> 40:27.921
Everything OK?

40:28.081 --> 40:30.081
We should talk after your meeting.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.241
Sit.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.921
I was worried you were not going to come.

41:00.161 --> 41:02.361
I'd be left with a bill I can't pay.

41:04.041 --> 41:05.721
Eat, eat.

41:06.241 --> 41:08.241
I apologise, I was hungry.

41:09.361 --> 41:13.121
In my old age, I start eating earlier and earlier.

41:14.641 --> 41:15.921
Monsieur.

41:18.361 --> 41:20.361
All right, so.

41:39.881 --> 41:42.281
It's not often you see this amount of money.

41:45.601 --> 41:48.041
These days, it's all in the air.

41:49.881 --> 41:52.601
Perhaps that's why mine
continues to blow away.

41:55.161 --> 41:56.841
<i>So.</i>

41:57.001 --> 41:59.001
You have your money. So talk.

41:59.721 --> 42:01.441
Don't you want to order first?

42:02.161 --> 42:03.841
I'm not here on holiday, Mr Sieg.

42:04.001 --> 42:08.401
I'm here because I saw my son for the first time
in eight years in a video last night-

42:08.561 --> 42:12.681
scared and alone in a strange house
and I want to know what happened to him.

42:22.681 --> 42:24.681
You've accepted a bribe from us.

42:26.201 --> 42:28.601
Anything you say would be empty in a law court.

42:30.241 --> 42:32.241
They're acting against my advice.

42:33.201 --> 42:35.201
You can speak freely, Mr Sieg.

42:38.761 --> 42:40.761
I used to work for people.

42:41.481 --> 42:43.481
People in the caids de cite.

42:45.041 --> 42:46.521
A Romanian crew.

42:46.681 --> 42:48.681
I did odd jobs...

42:50.521 --> 42:52.521
...driving important people...

42:54.721 --> 42:56.721
...transporting goods, you see?

42:58.001 --> 43:00.001
And sometimes they would ask me...

43:01.921 --> 43:04.801
...to clean up after certain incidents.

43:06.161 --> 43:07.921
It was my trade, after all.

43:08.081 --> 43:09.881
And I ran a good business for a while.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.801
Get to the point.

43:14.361 --> 43:16.361
I was called to Châlons du Bois.

43:17.041 --> 43:20.921
There was a room that needed cleaning
in the street where you saw my car.

43:21.081 --> 43:22.441
Number 70.

43:39.161 --> 43:42.681
<i>I'm kept away from the high conversations,
you see what I mean?</i>

43:44.401 --> 43:46.041
<i>I don't ask questions.</i>

43:46.841 --> 43:48.801
For my safety, you understand?

43:48.961 --> 43:50.681
What happened in that house?

43:50.841 --> 43:52.841
Pro Nettoyage.

43:57.001 --> 44:01.761
The man who showed me in...
was wearing a mask.

44:03.561 --> 44:05.561
He didn't speak very much.

44:07.161 --> 44:09.641
The boy must have been removed
while I worked.

44:32.121 --> 44:34.121
<i>In the basement, there was blood.</i>

44:36.801 --> 44:39.921
I believe your son was held
in that basement there.

44:40.081 --> 44:42.241
We know all this. It's useless. What else?

44:44.041 --> 44:45.841
What else?

44:46.001 --> 44:48.361
I was sent to the street by the pool,

44:48.521 --> 44:51.321
to remove anything
that might be linked to the boy.

44:51.481 --> 44:55.121
But when I got there,
one of your policemen was already there.

44:55.961 --> 44:59.481
He bagged some evidence,
what that was, I can't say.

45:04.321 --> 45:05.801
That's it?

45:05.961 --> 45:07.681
That's all you have?

45:08.601 --> 45:12.481
And you expect us to let you walk out of here
with all that money for that?

45:12.641 --> 45:14.641
Tell me about this policeman.

45:15.761 --> 45:17.761
He was a Moroccan, I guess.

45:19.441 --> 45:20.881
Khalid Ziane.

45:21.041 --> 45:24.241
That can't be all you know.
You must know something useful.

45:24.401 --> 45:26.121
JULIEN: I think he does.

45:27.881 --> 45:32.041
Ziane never submitted any evidence
during the investigation.

45:32.201 --> 45:33.801
You're sure?

45:33.961 --> 45:37.081
There was hardly any evidence to work with.
I'm absolutely sure.

45:37.241 --> 45:41.361
Whatever he took from that scene,
he never shared with us.

45:42.801 --> 45:44.801
- We need to talk to him.
- Yes.

45:45.401 --> 45:48.241
You're not leaving?
I just ordered a bottle for the table.

45:48.401 --> 45:50.401
- You can manage it fine.
- Enjoy.

45:51.841 --> 45:54.841
I left something, you know,
when I cleaned up that room.

45:55.001 --> 45:56.881
I saw something which I left.

45:57.041 --> 45:58.761
And I should have got rid of it.

45:59.561 --> 46:04.641
The boy had drawn a small stick figure
onto the wall.

46:06.401 --> 46:08.081
He had these funny big ears.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.521
I left it there.

46:11.681 --> 46:15.601
Because I didn't think it right
that he should disappear completely.

46:26.361 --> 46:29.241
JULIEN:
Khalid Ziane is in jail in Châlons du Bois.

46:30.161 --> 46:32.521
We must wait until morning to speak with him.

46:32.681 --> 46:34.561
Oh, Christ.

46:34.721 --> 46:36.921
You really think he might know something -

46:37.081 --> 46:39.401
some evidence that he may
or may not have logged?

46:39.561 --> 46:42.721
- From a man like Ziane?
- It's the best we have, Mrs Hughes.

46:42.881 --> 46:46.121
I didn't think I'd be staying the night,
I need to go pick up some things.

46:46.281 --> 46:47.441
OK, let's get going.

46:47.601 --> 46:49.921
Perhaps you might go on ahead, Mrs Hughes?

46:50.881 --> 46:53.801
Tony and I have something to discuss.

46:55.241 --> 46:57.321
Oh, well, I'll see you at the station?

46:58.161 --> 47:00.041
Bruxelles-Midi. Yes.

47:00.201 --> 47:02.201
- What is it?
- (Phone rings)

47:04.121 --> 47:06.441
It's Laurence. I'll have to call her back.

47:19.761 --> 47:23.241
I went to Audresselles,
to the home Ian Garrett was building.

47:26.801 --> 47:28.201
<i>OK.</i>

47:37.361 --> 47:39.361
Buried in the cement, I found this.

47:42.201 --> 47:43.761
Don't you want to look inside?

47:44.761 --> 47:46.761
I know what's in there.

47:47.561 --> 47:50.561
DNA tests will show the blood
belongs to Ian Garrett.

48:31.081 --> 48:34.281
Many years ago,
I reported my own daughter to the police.

48:35.521 --> 48:38.321
She was arrested on drugs charges and theft.

48:40.441 --> 48:44.881
She was given a 12-month sentence -
two years suspended in addition.

48:46.801 --> 48:49.081
I thought there was no other way
to end her addiction.

48:49.241 --> 48:51.721
I thought she would kill herself with drugs.

48:53.001 --> 48:55.081
I was sure I was doing the right thing.

49:00.761 --> 49:02.761
But I was wrong.

49:03.441 --> 49:07.321
She fell in with a far worse crowd,
turned to crimes far more serious.

49:13.961 --> 49:15.841
And she wouldn't talk to me.

49:16.001 --> 49:18.121
However hard I've tried to help her...

49:21.521 --> 49:24.921
...to make her listen, it was too late.

49:27.401 --> 49:29.401
I pushed her away.

49:31.321 --> 49:33.041
I betrayed her.

49:35.241 --> 49:36.441
<i>So...</i>

49:42.121 --> 49:44.881
I ask myself, "How is justice best served?

49:47.401 --> 49:50.081
What good can come
from sending you to prison?"

49:54.241 --> 49:57.241
You've been in a prison
ever since your son was taken.

50:06.081 --> 50:08.081
(Phone keypad bleeps)

50:16.961 --> 50:18.401
Laurence?

51:23.921 --> 51:25.041
Vincent.

51:28.241 --> 51:30.241
You've been looking for me.

51:40.121 --> 51:42.121
<i>May I ask what's changed your mind?</i>

51:43.961 --> 51:45.361
<i>Sorry?</i>

51:45.521 --> 51:51.041
<i>Well, I've been trying to speak to you for years
but you've always refused. So, why now?</i>

51:55.241 --> 51:56.761
<i>BOURG: I've changed.</i>

51:56.921 --> 51:59.481
<i>I must forgive those who have hurt me.</i>

52:00.641 --> 52:04.881
<i>And I must apologise for the bad I have done.</i>

52:08.681 --> 52:10.681
I wish to speak.

52:11.361 --> 52:13.201
<i>OK.</i>

52:13.361 --> 52:17.441
All I need you to do
is to confirm some facts for me.

52:18.401 --> 52:22.161
These are facts that'll help me
prove what happened to Oliver Hughes.

52:37.201 --> 52:39.081
- Tony, you're back.
- Yeah.

52:39.241 --> 52:41.241
Good, good.

52:43.321 --> 52:45.121
Come with me.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.001
I found your son's drawing.

52:53.921 --> 52:56.161
- It was in the laundry you left me.
- I'd lost it?

52:56.321 --> 52:58.321
Folded in your shirt pocket.

53:05.921 --> 53:07.921
I know what it means to you.

53:10.441 --> 53:12.441
Thank you.

53:14.281 --> 53:15.841
It's silly, I know.

53:16.001 --> 53:18.001
Far from it.

53:36.721 --> 53:39.841
Alain was given this after one year's sobriety.

53:41.441 --> 53:43.321
One for each sober year.

53:43.481 --> 53:45.361
So long Alain struggled.

53:46.121 --> 53:49.641
But this year...he has 20 years.

53:50.721 --> 53:52.321
And still I keep this,

53:52.481 --> 53:55.281
a reminder of how proud he made me that day.

53:57.601 --> 53:59.521
And as long as you carry that picture,

53:59.681 --> 54:01.561
you'll carry your son with you.

54:01.721 --> 54:03.721
Look after it.

54:14.161 --> 54:16.161
(Reporters clamouring)

54:24.001 --> 54:28.161
REPORTER: Why are you going home?
Will you be coming back to Châlons du Bois?

54:28.321 --> 54:30.321
(Reporters fire questions)

54:36.281 --> 54:39.361
How can you go home
if the police haven't found Oliver?

54:39.521 --> 54:41.521
Mrs Hughes, how can you go home now?

55:39.441 --> 55:42.081
You've had 24 hours.
I need the evidence back.

55:42.241 --> 55:45.321
We had an agreement.
I have done everything you ask from me.

55:45.481 --> 55:47.801
Everything you've given me
has amounted to nothing.

55:47.961 --> 55:49.161
I gave you evidence!

55:49.321 --> 55:51.721
You shouldn't have given that to me
in the first place.

55:51.881 --> 55:56.321
I just gave it to you to make you go away.
Now, if you tell anybody about Chamartaines...

55:57.001 --> 56:00.121
Don't threaten me unless you want Baptiste
to find out who you are.

56:00.281 --> 56:02.281
Or perhaps I just break your legs.

56:03.121 --> 56:06.241
Come on, try me.
Find out what kind of enemy I am.

56:14.241 --> 56:15.841
(Door slams)

57:08.721 --> 57:10.721
<i>- Merci
- Au revoir.</i>

57:39.481 --> 57:41.001
Arrghh!

57:52.281 --> 57:54.161
Argh! Argh!

57:54.321 --> 57:56.321
(Julien screams)

57:57.161 --> 57:58.881
MARK: Stay down!

58:05.441 --> 58:07.441
Stay down! Stay down!

58:14.161 --> 58:15.681
(Grunts)

58:16.305 --> 58:22.439
