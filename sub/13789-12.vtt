WEBVTT

00:04.755 --> 00:07.798
Uh, thanks for another
perfect day, my love.

00:07.798 --> 00:11.892
I know playing tug-of-war
with Bennett's sweater
is sort of a boy-dog game.

00:11.892 --> 00:13.934
Next time
we'll play a girl-dog game,

00:13.934 --> 00:16.437
like tug-of-war
with Ellen's sweater.

00:16.437 --> 00:18.809
Oh, it's great that
you two lovebirds

00:18.809 --> 00:20.231
are having so much fun,

00:20.231 --> 00:21.772
but it's time for Princess
to go home.

00:21.772 --> 00:25.236
Avery, let me put this
as calmly and rationally

00:25.236 --> 00:26.817
as I possibly can.

00:26.817 --> 00:30.951
( shouting )
No!

00:32.243 --> 00:33.864
I'm sorry, Stan.

00:33.864 --> 00:35.706
I told Heather
we'd have her back by now.

00:35.706 --> 00:36.747
I'll take her to the hole
in the fence

00:36.747 --> 00:37.748
between our yards.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.253
Adieu, my love.

00:42.253 --> 00:46.377
I'll bark to you all night long
from Avery's bedroom window.

00:46.377 --> 00:48.549
You won't mind that, right?

00:48.549 --> 00:52.173
Stan, I should buy you
a hat made of shoes,

00:52.173 --> 00:55.556
because you are obviously
head over heels!

00:55.556 --> 00:58.269
( laughs and snorts )

00:58.269 --> 01:00.481
Oh, my gosh,
I'm turning into Mom.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.274
Aww, look.

01:03.274 --> 01:05.106
I guess
being in love is exhausting.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.777
( snoring )

01:06.777 --> 01:09.029
Oh, it's like replacing
the wheels on my bike,

01:09.029 --> 01:11.992
very "tiring."

01:11.992 --> 01:14.575
Oh, my gosh,
am I becoming Mom too?

01:15.616 --> 01:16.957
Who's becoming me?

01:16.957 --> 01:18.369
Did someone say
something charming,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.461
or did they develop
a new muscle in their neck?

01:24.965 --> 01:26.467
Hi, kids.

01:27.508 --> 01:28.589
Groom.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.091
Groom.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.303
What was that?

01:32.303 --> 01:33.344
Oh, it sounded like
somebody said

01:33.344 --> 01:34.765
"groom, groom."

01:34.765 --> 01:37.808
It was "vroom, vroom!"

01:37.808 --> 01:39.520
Tyler was teaching me
how to drive.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.852
And we're starting
with the sounds a car makes.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.644
Vroom vroom!

01:43.644 --> 01:45.776
( mimicking cars speeding )

01:49.190 --> 01:50.691
Oh, that's the police
pulling us over

01:50.691 --> 01:52.493
because Avery started
driving too fast.

01:52.493 --> 01:53.994
What can I say, officer?

01:53.994 --> 01:55.906
I've got 400 horses
under this hood

01:55.906 --> 01:59.200
and I got to
let 'em run free!

01:59.200 --> 02:02.623
Honey, in real life
if you get pulled over,
just cry.

02:02.623 --> 02:07.087
I'm so sorry, officer,
it's just the car, the kids,

02:07.087 --> 02:09.340
and my husband is an ogre.

02:10.551 --> 02:12.553
Would you rather
I pay the ticket?

02:12.553 --> 02:14.014
Well, the thing is,
Ellen,

02:14.014 --> 02:15.386
it's really uncomfortable
when you do that

02:15.386 --> 02:16.757
and I'm in the car.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.562
Wow!
That was way too close.

02:21.562 --> 02:23.394
Stan, wake up.

02:23.394 --> 02:24.725
Huh, what?

02:24.725 --> 02:26.317
You were sleep talking.

02:26.317 --> 02:27.528
You've never
done that before.

02:27.528 --> 02:28.529
This is terrible.

02:28.529 --> 02:29.900
Yeah, Mom and Dad
heard you.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.402
If someone finds out
you can talk,

02:31.402 --> 02:33.364
you'll be taken away
and experimented on.

02:33.364 --> 02:35.115
That's my worst fear.

02:35.115 --> 02:38.279
That, and having
a slip-and-fall accident
while I'm alone.

02:38.279 --> 02:40.371
That's why I signed up
for this medical alert service.

02:40.371 --> 02:41.872
( beeps )

02:41.872 --> 02:43.163
JERRY: ( on device )
Stan, are you okay?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.916
Sorry, Jerry,
just testing it out.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.338
( beeps )

02:48.339 --> 02:50.090
Don't worry.

02:50.090 --> 02:52.213
I'm sure the sleep talking
was just a one-time thing.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.505
( snores )
Groom.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.098
Tyler, Stan's secret
could get out.

02:58.098 --> 02:59.139
I know.

02:59.139 --> 03:00.351
And on top of that,

03:00.351 --> 03:01.762
the car is rolling down
the street

03:01.762 --> 03:03.514
'cause you didn't
put it in park.

03:03.514 --> 03:04.765
( mimicking car crashing )

03:04.765 --> 03:06.357
( beeps )

03:06.357 --> 03:09.400
Jerry, I think
I've just been in an accident!

03:10.521 --> 03:12.313
I've been talking in my sleep,

03:12.313 --> 03:14.365
so from now on,
I'm gonna have to avoid

03:14.365 --> 03:16.487
falling asleep
in all my usual places

03:16.487 --> 03:17.908
where people can see me.

03:17.908 --> 03:20.160
The house, the patio,

03:20.160 --> 03:21.782
a patch of grass,

03:21.782 --> 03:24.665
during a football game,

03:24.665 --> 03:26.877
at the Rose Bowl.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.055
Until we figure out

03:45.055 --> 03:46.517
what's making you sleep talk,

03:46.517 --> 03:49.980
you cannot fall asleep
in front of Mom or Dad.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.153
I hate to say this
but should we get out the crate?

03:53.153 --> 03:56.817
Good idea.
We'll crate your parents.

03:56.817 --> 04:01.822
It's not cruel.
They'll feel cozy in there.

04:01.822 --> 04:05.326
Hey, Dad,
can I ask you a question
about talking in your sleep?

04:05.326 --> 04:08.869
Why? What did you hear?
Was I talking about
July 9th, 1983 at summer camp?

04:08.869 --> 04:10.961
Because nothing happened.

04:10.961 --> 04:14.585
Not you talking in your sleep,
just sleep talking in general.

04:14.585 --> 04:16.717
You know,
as a prominent psychologist,

04:16.717 --> 04:19.179
not as an ex-camper who,
and I quote,

04:19.179 --> 04:21.802
"Learned about muskrats
the hard way."

04:21.802 --> 04:24.845
So, somniloquy...

04:24.845 --> 04:26.807
Yes, a very interesting topic.

04:26.807 --> 04:28.809
You see,
sleep-wake transitions

04:28.809 --> 04:31.271
are controlled by the brain's
reticular activating system.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.984
STAN: Listening to this
makes me sleepy.

04:33.984 --> 04:35.446
Wow!

04:35.446 --> 04:37.608
What a wake up call!

04:40.110 --> 04:41.822
So what causes
sleep talking?

04:41.822 --> 04:46.367
Well, typically
it comes from stress.
Stress?

04:46.367 --> 04:49.209
Yes, when you can't resolve
something in your waking hours,

04:49.209 --> 04:51.211
you will try to
resolve it in your sleep.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.964
So boring.

04:53.964 --> 04:55.716
...neurotransmitters
within the brain.

04:55.716 --> 04:57.127
They release
certain touch--

04:57.127 --> 04:59.920
You know
what I do to relieve stress?

04:59.920 --> 05:01.762
I pet my dog.

05:01.762 --> 05:04.515
I pet him vigorously.

05:04.515 --> 05:06.427
Well, that does look relaxing.

05:06.427 --> 05:08.018
Hey, let your old man
in on that.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.191
I wonder
if it'd bother them to know

05:11.191 --> 05:14.815
I've been rolling around
in possum guts.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.317
Eh, they'll figure it out
when they find the tooth.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.152
Do you kids
want to go play outside?

05:22.152 --> 05:23.904
I'd like to do
my neck exercises.

05:23.904 --> 05:25.786
And it can be
a little frightening

05:25.786 --> 05:27.618
for the uninitiated.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.710
( groans )

05:31.662 --> 05:33.834
We can go outside
and make dirt friends.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.377
He makes dirt into
beautiful human shapes.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.628
Then he names them
and makes up

05:37.628 --> 05:39.630
amazing stories
about their lives.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.722
And then I smash them.

05:43.263 --> 05:45.345
Let's do something
crafty and colorful.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.428
Let's do something
we can smash.

05:47.428 --> 05:48.559
I know what's both!

05:48.559 --> 05:51.181
Pinatas!
Stained glass windows.

05:51.181 --> 05:52.853
I mean pinatas.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.736
Pinatas it is.
I'll help you get set up.

05:55.736 --> 05:57.648
I'm glad your problems
are easy to solve.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.899
I still don't know
what to get Bennett

05:58.899 --> 06:00.651
for our anniversary.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.403
Last year I just got him
a t-shirt that said

06:02.403 --> 06:03.864
"I'm with my favorite lady,"

06:03.864 --> 06:05.075
but he only wears it
when he goes to lunch

06:05.075 --> 06:06.907
with his mother.

06:08.699 --> 06:11.251
Dad said sleep talking
is usually due to stress.

06:11.251 --> 06:12.873
What are you
stressed about, Stan?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.255
Nothing.
I couldn't be happier.

06:15.255 --> 06:17.418
I have Princess,
a loving family,

06:17.418 --> 06:19.089
and movie star good looks.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.634
And a piece of glitter
on my tooth.

06:23.634 --> 06:27.558
When you were asleep,
you were saying "groom, groom."

06:27.558 --> 06:28.809
I know you hate
being groomed,

06:28.809 --> 06:30.060
but maybe you know
you need it

06:30.060 --> 06:31.682
and that's causing you stress.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.314
I know how stressed I get
if my hair isn't up to

06:34.314 --> 06:36.607
International Elite Secret
Hair Club standards.

06:36.607 --> 06:38.979
What's International
Elite Secret Hair Club?

06:38.979 --> 06:41.151
Nothing.
I've said too much.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.905
Well, if you think it'll get me
to stop sleep talking,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.487
you can groom me.

06:46.487 --> 06:48.408
And I'll try not to put up
a fight this time.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.831
Hey, that wasn't so bad.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.206
It's worth it to solve your
sleep talking problem.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.708
That's easy for you to say.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.039
You don't have
a video conference tonight

06:59.039 --> 07:01.802
with the International
Elite Secret--

07:01.802 --> 07:02.803
Never mind.

07:08.008 --> 07:12.643
Groom, groom.

07:15.265 --> 07:18.058
Doghouse.

07:18.058 --> 07:19.520
Doghouse?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.693
Just 'cause I finished
the ice cream

07:22.693 --> 07:25.986
I'm still in the doghouse?

07:25.986 --> 07:28.368
Hope you enjoyed
that Rocky Road

07:28.368 --> 07:31.952
'cause you're on one now.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.163
Good one, Ellen.

07:34.915 --> 07:36.707
Stan, I've been
looking for you!

07:36.707 --> 07:38.378
Doghouse.

07:39.379 --> 07:40.380
Who's that?

07:40.380 --> 07:41.461
What?

07:46.547 --> 07:48.138
Bennett,
you have dog breath.

07:48.138 --> 07:51.552
Oh, did you eat kibble?

07:51.552 --> 07:53.473
Tyler,
what's going on?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.395
Stan, it's gotten worse.

07:55.395 --> 07:58.438
You're not just sleep talking,
you're sleep walking now.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.480
All right, now get out
of here. There's something
important I have to do.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.027
Let's buy Tyler a car.

08:07.027 --> 08:08.739
Tyler doesn't
need a car.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.160
I know.
Dang it!

08:15.035 --> 08:16.957
Guys, this is serious.

08:16.957 --> 08:18.498
Stan's now sleep walking,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.420
which means
he's taking his sleep talking

08:20.420 --> 08:21.752
all over the house.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.923
We know
where this could end.

08:22.923 --> 08:24.174
Sleep rodeo.

08:24.174 --> 08:26.797
The most dangerous
kind of rodeo.

08:29.259 --> 08:34.094
Stan, your secret is this close
to being found out.

08:34.094 --> 08:36.476
You've never sleep talked
or walked before.

08:36.476 --> 08:39.019
Or sleep rodeo'd.

08:41.101 --> 08:43.273
Right.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.565
So we have to figure out

08:44.565 --> 08:46.907
why you're doing it now
to make it stop.

08:46.907 --> 08:49.700
First you said "groom"

08:49.700 --> 08:51.612
and then "doghouse."

08:51.612 --> 08:52.703
What do they mean?

08:52.703 --> 08:54.615
Maybe I want a doghouse.

08:54.615 --> 08:57.117
No, Stan.
Sleep talking is like a dream.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.709
Things have deeper meanings.

08:58.709 --> 09:01.752
So "doghouse"
probably doesn't mean doghouse.

09:01.752 --> 09:04.504
Let's say the first one
to figure it out gets a prize.

09:04.504 --> 09:05.836
This isn't a game, Tyler.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.127
She's right.

09:07.127 --> 09:10.510
We need to make it a game.

09:10.510 --> 09:13.223
No. No, no, no. No, no.
We need to think.

09:13.223 --> 09:15.726
Why did Stan say
"doghouse"?

09:15.726 --> 09:19.179
"In the doghouse" means
being in trouble.
Good, Tyler.

09:19.179 --> 09:23.854
Yes! I'm on the board!
I'm winning!
Still not a game.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.397
Maybe not to you,
but our studio audience
is loving it.

09:27.397 --> 09:28.819
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!

09:28.819 --> 09:31.451
All right!
Go, Tyler!

09:31.451 --> 09:32.693
Ow!

09:34.995 --> 09:37.698
Stan...

09:37.698 --> 09:39.459
you also said "groom."

09:39.459 --> 09:41.962
A doghouse doesn't have
anything to do with "groom."

09:41.962 --> 09:45.205
Unless you were growling,
and then said "room."

09:45.205 --> 09:47.257
Like "grr-room."

09:47.257 --> 09:49.970
That actually works.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.842
Hey, maybe you're stressed

09:51.842 --> 09:53.303
because you don't have
your own room

09:53.303 --> 09:55.676
like everyone else
in the family.

09:55.676 --> 09:58.058
Room, doghouse.

09:58.058 --> 10:00.100
Maybe you want a doghouse.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.312
Hey, I said that
to begin with!

10:02.312 --> 10:03.894
I win!

10:03.894 --> 10:06.857
Now let's see
what you've won.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.650
Oh, please be a boat!
Please be a boat!

10:09.650 --> 10:13.403
A bunch of girl clothes!

10:13.403 --> 10:15.195
Yeah, not really my style,

10:15.195 --> 10:16.867
but I guess
I can put them in a big pile

10:16.867 --> 10:18.498
and roll around in them.

10:18.498 --> 10:21.541
( laughing )

10:25.085 --> 10:26.667
You're actually
doing it?

10:26.667 --> 10:28.208
I thought that was just a joke.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.671
Oh, I don't joke about
rolling around in stuff.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.674
I take that
very, very seriously.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.849
I'm done with my pinata.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.520
Me too.

10:42.222 --> 10:45.315
It's Abraham Lincoln.

10:45.315 --> 10:49.980
I'm just gonna smile like
I do when grown-ups say
things that don't make sense.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.822
Well, let's see yours.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.368
What the what?

10:58.368 --> 11:01.581
I was trying to make a lizard,
then I got distracted,

11:01.581 --> 11:04.124
then this happened.

11:04.124 --> 11:07.377
How can you be so much
better than me at this?

11:07.377 --> 11:09.169
I'm better than you
at everything.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.551
I'm good at turning stuff
into other stuff.

11:11.551 --> 11:13.884
That reminds me,
where's your bathroom?

11:17.387 --> 11:19.509
Hey, how's it going
in here?

11:19.509 --> 11:20.721
Wow!

11:20.721 --> 11:23.473
Chloe,
your pinata is amazing.

11:23.473 --> 11:25.766
It looks exactly like
the Notre Dame cathedral.

11:25.766 --> 11:27.768
Well, actually--

11:27.768 --> 11:31.361
It's so much better than
this lump with the hat.

11:31.361 --> 11:33.774
Poor Mason.

11:33.774 --> 11:34.985
Yeah.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.907
Can you believe
he made this?

11:36.907 --> 11:38.989
Whoo!

11:38.989 --> 11:42.372
But yours is
so wonderful.

11:42.372 --> 11:45.245
I just had a great idea.
Can you make
a pinata for me

11:45.245 --> 11:48.959
to give to your Dad for
our anniversary? I want
to fill it with breath mints

11:48.959 --> 11:53.383
because I love your father,
but I also like breathing
and last night I almost stopped.

11:54.594 --> 11:57.968
Pinata, huh?
How can I say no?

11:57.968 --> 12:01.261
How can I say no?
How can I say no?

12:02.682 --> 12:05.305
Hi, Chloe's mom.
Do you like my pinata?

12:05.305 --> 12:06.897
I was trying
to make a lizard.

12:06.897 --> 12:11.021
Well, it is the best lizard
I've ever seen.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.486
Your mom is lucky
she's pretty.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.908
STAN: All right!

12:17.908 --> 12:21.031
A doghouse that
expresses my individuality.

12:23.453 --> 12:26.416
And there's room
for all the clothes I won!

12:26.416 --> 12:28.458
You did not win
my clothes, Stan.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.500
And you don't even
wear bikinis.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.964
Only when I'm on a yacht
with rappers.

12:33.964 --> 12:38.138
Look at me!
I'm giant Tyler!

12:39.509 --> 12:42.012
If only I could find
a giant comb.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.726
You went out
and bought a tiny doll comb

12:46.726 --> 12:48.148
just so you could do that bit?

12:48.148 --> 12:49.729
No. This is my eyebrow comb.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.985
Stan, I just hope that
having your own space

12:54.985 --> 12:56.526
will keep you
from being stressed

12:56.526 --> 12:58.738
so that you'll stop
sleep walking and talking.

12:58.738 --> 13:01.741
Don't worry, Avery.
I'm sure it will.

13:01.741 --> 13:03.323
( snoring )

13:03.323 --> 13:05.665
Princess.

13:12.502 --> 13:14.794
I sing a song of latte

13:14.794 --> 13:17.337
Pairs nicely with biscotti

13:17.337 --> 13:18.839
The few of the litter...

13:18.839 --> 13:21.051
We've looked everywhere
I can think of.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.683
If Stan's not here,
I don't know what else to do.

13:23.683 --> 13:25.265
Why are all these
people here?

13:25.265 --> 13:27.517
They're having
a spoken-word poetry slam.

13:27.517 --> 13:28.768
I thought poetry
was just something

13:28.768 --> 13:30.310
they made up for school.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.852
Like Calculus or English.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.235
Now I ain't got nothin'

13:35.235 --> 13:37.898
Like a doll without stuffin'

13:37.898 --> 13:39.149
Coffee house

13:39.149 --> 13:41.531
Why you gotta change
your muffin?

13:41.531 --> 13:44.364
Bring back maple!

13:48.118 --> 13:49.369
There he is!

13:49.369 --> 13:51.001
Oh, no,
he's on the stage.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.452
Thanks for coming.

13:52.452 --> 13:53.713
We're gonna
take a quick intermission.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.755
We have muffins
at the concession stand.

13:55.755 --> 13:57.918
But no maple!

14:00.881 --> 14:03.133
Princess!

14:05.926 --> 14:07.267
Princess...

14:08.308 --> 14:09.890
Charming

14:09.890 --> 14:13.313
Why can't the girl's kiss
wake the prince?

14:13.313 --> 14:17.067
Flipping the fairy tale
does not make me wince

14:21.241 --> 14:23.323
Thanks.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.535
Stan, you were
sleep walking again.

14:25.535 --> 14:28.288
You spoke in front of everybody
at the Poetry Slam.

14:28.288 --> 14:31.621
Really?
Did I bring the knowledge?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.664
You almost gave away
that you're a talking dog.

14:34.664 --> 14:37.998
It's getting worse.
You're walking into
public to sleep talk now.

14:37.998 --> 14:40.880
Why can't I be Beauty
and she be the Beast?

14:40.880 --> 14:44.304
Lemons and limes,
nickels and dimes

14:44.304 --> 14:47.057
Until my
Princess Charming comes

14:47.057 --> 14:51.061
I'll just be here
dropping rhymes

14:52.182 --> 14:53.353
All right.

14:53.353 --> 14:54.724
Wow.

14:54.724 --> 14:58.568
This is how
you start a movement.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.863
This has to be solved.

15:03.863 --> 15:05.195
Okay, here's what
you've said in your sleep:

15:05.195 --> 15:09.579
"groom," "doghouse,"
and now "princess."

15:09.579 --> 15:10.700
Wait,

15:10.700 --> 15:12.202
I think I know
what this means.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.794
If you win a boat, Avery,
can I go on it?

15:14.794 --> 15:18.248
I'll wear my bikini!

15:19.919 --> 15:22.342
Think about what you're saying
in your sleep.

15:22.342 --> 15:25.465
I think "groom" is because
Princess is so well-groomed.

15:25.465 --> 15:27.807
She's a show dog.
You feel inadequate.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.760
Like you're always
in the "doghouse."

15:30.760 --> 15:34.014
Saying "Princess"
is the last piece of the puzzle.

15:34.014 --> 15:35.895
She's the reason that
you've been stressed out.

15:35.895 --> 15:38.608
No, there's nothing wrong
with Princess.

15:38.608 --> 15:41.821
Aside from her having
a bad case of the beautifuls.

15:41.821 --> 15:45.565
But I already got it,
so we're cool.

15:45.565 --> 15:49.909
Stan, if Princess is the reason
that you're sleep talking,

15:49.909 --> 15:52.452
you have to stay away
from her to protect yourself.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.743
Hey, look,

15:53.743 --> 15:56.666
I know that you love her,
but we love you

15:56.666 --> 15:58.378
and we don't want anything
to happen to you.

15:58.378 --> 16:02.842
If being with
Princess causes that,
is it really worth it?

16:02.842 --> 16:05.755
I do love Princess.
I don't care what
it costs me.

16:05.755 --> 16:07.677
I don't even care
if you're right.

16:07.677 --> 16:10.760
There's no way
I'm staying away from her.

16:13.393 --> 16:14.434
Where were you?

16:14.434 --> 16:16.016
At the Poetry Slam.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.149
I never knew I had so much
to say about feminism.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.691
Those chicks ate it up!

16:24.944 --> 16:28.368
Happy anniversary, honey.
I got you that necklace
you ordered,

16:28.368 --> 16:31.281
had gift wrapped,
and then put on my dresser
with a note that says

16:31.281 --> 16:33.283
"Give this to me
in the morning."

16:33.283 --> 16:35.495
Oh, a necklace!

16:36.746 --> 16:38.668
Thank you so much, honey.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.620
This is so much better than
the barbecue tools

16:40.620 --> 16:41.961
you got me last year
on your own.

16:43.213 --> 16:45.965
And I had Chloe make us
a pinata!

16:45.965 --> 16:48.338
Oh, honey.
That's wonderful.

16:48.338 --> 16:51.131
You got me something that
you didn't spend any money on.

16:53.553 --> 16:54.804
Ta-da!

16:54.804 --> 16:56.056
Wow!

16:56.056 --> 16:57.897
This is incredible!

16:57.897 --> 17:00.850
It looks just like us.

17:00.850 --> 17:04.234
Chloe honey,
this is amazing work.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.606
What you are saying
is the truth.

17:06.606 --> 17:08.818
You are so talented.

17:08.818 --> 17:11.951
That is also something
you were saying.

17:11.951 --> 17:13.783
And it means so much to us

17:13.783 --> 17:16.706
because you made this
with your own two hands.

17:16.706 --> 17:20.330
So many words
are happening right now.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.293
What's amazing about it is
how much love she put into it.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.754
Oh, and the amount of hours
to do this?

17:24.754 --> 17:26.045
Oh, can you believe it?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.046
I mean, we knew
she was a sweet girl,

17:27.046 --> 17:28.628
but this kind of talent--

17:28.628 --> 17:30.880
Stop!

17:30.880 --> 17:32.762
I can't take it anymore!

17:32.762 --> 17:37.016
I didn't make your pinata.
Mason did. He's a genius.

17:37.016 --> 17:39.179
Sweetie, why did you feel
the need to take credit

17:39.179 --> 17:40.640
for someone else's work?

17:40.640 --> 17:43.143
Well, Mommy was saying
how good his pinata was,

17:43.143 --> 17:44.774
and how bad mine was
and I just...

17:44.774 --> 17:46.986
Oh, honey,
I'm so sorry.

17:46.986 --> 17:49.529
I didn't mean to criticize
something you did.

17:49.529 --> 17:53.573
I thought I was making
fun of another child's
work behind his back.

17:53.573 --> 17:58.118
Ellen, how could you have said
anything bad about

17:58.118 --> 18:00.540
something that Chloe made
with her own--

18:00.540 --> 18:03.042
Oh, boy.

18:03.042 --> 18:04.964
I mean, sweetie,

18:04.964 --> 18:07.167
this is a very good...

18:07.167 --> 18:08.468
It's Abraham Lincoln.

18:08.468 --> 18:10.510
Oh, boy.

18:10.510 --> 18:13.343
Chloe, sweetie, listen.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.136
Not everybody can be good
at everything.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.677
And that's okay.

18:17.677 --> 18:19.929
I mean, you are good
at so many things.

18:19.929 --> 18:24.023
I guess. And I guess
it's nice that Mason's
good at something.

18:24.023 --> 18:25.775
We have to hold our spot
as the third grade's

18:25.775 --> 18:28.608
number two power couple
after Olivia and Gabriel.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.109
She wears pretty dresses

18:30.109 --> 18:32.612
and he'll lick the window
for a quarter.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.865
MASON: Help! I'm stuck.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.907
Mason?
Where are you?

18:37.907 --> 18:40.740
MASON: I don't know.
It's dark in here.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.202
He must be
inside the pinata!

18:43.663 --> 18:45.625
Mason,
can you breathe in there?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.627
MASON: Only through
my nose and mouth.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.670
I know what
we're gonna have to do.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.252
And it's gonna be awesome.

18:52.252 --> 18:54.013
I got my pinata stick.

18:54.013 --> 18:55.425
No, no, no, no...

18:55.425 --> 18:56.466
You can't do that!

18:56.466 --> 18:59.469
This is a beautiful pinata!

18:59.469 --> 19:01.931
And there's a little boy
in there.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.564
We'll have to break it
apart carefully.

19:04.564 --> 19:06.356
Help! It's still stuck.

19:06.356 --> 19:08.978
Oh, Mason.
Oh, honey.

19:08.978 --> 19:11.231
Mason, we thought
you were in the pinata.

19:11.231 --> 19:13.233
This is a symbol of our love.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.575
Thank goodness
we didn't have to smash it open.

19:15.575 --> 19:16.576
You mean like this?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.619
No!

19:19.619 --> 19:21.201
No!

19:26.836 --> 19:28.958
( screams )

19:28.958 --> 19:31.711
No!

19:31.711 --> 19:33.713
No!

19:39.389 --> 19:40.470
Smash!

19:44.604 --> 19:46.356
You know what,

19:46.356 --> 19:49.689
it doesn't matter that
Pinata Us is destroyed.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.022
Because what we have
is gonna last forever.

19:53.022 --> 19:54.694
Marrying you
was the best decision

19:54.694 --> 19:55.905
I ever made.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.697
Oh, Bennett,
before I married you,

19:57.697 --> 19:59.239
I always felt like
something was missing.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.371
But now I have everything
I could ever want.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.166
That's it.
I know why I'm sleep talking.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.251
Oh, good, breath mints.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.212
I'm so glad to hear
you say that.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.925
After last night,
you really need these.

20:19.098 --> 20:23.553
Stan, what's going on?
Jerry called us and said
there was an emergency
on the patio.

20:23.553 --> 20:26.766
JERRY:
Stan, I'm beginning
to think maybe you're
abusing the service.

20:26.766 --> 20:29.649
No, Jerry.
I just really
like talking to you.

20:29.649 --> 20:32.772
Oh, I really like
talking to you too, Stan.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.944
You know, my girlfriend
just broke up with me and--

20:34.944 --> 20:36.356
Yeah, that's great.
Gotta run.

20:36.356 --> 20:37.777
( beeps )

20:37.777 --> 20:39.409
Avery, you were right.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.911
My sleep talking
is about Princess.

20:41.911 --> 20:44.243
But you were wrong
about the other clues.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.166
"Doghouse" means I want
to make a home with her.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.500
"Groom" means
I want to marry her.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.791
You want to get married?

20:51.791 --> 20:55.044
Sorry, Tyler,
I love Princess.

20:55.044 --> 20:56.676
But dogs
don't get married.

20:56.676 --> 20:57.927
Exactly.

20:57.927 --> 20:59.509
The talking,
reasoning part of me

20:59.509 --> 21:00.760
wants to take things

21:00.760 --> 21:03.012
to the next level
with Princess.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.685
But dogs don't have
a next level.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.687
That's what was
making me stressed.

21:07.687 --> 21:09.479
But when I saw
your parents earlier

21:09.479 --> 21:11.311
talking about
their marriage,

21:11.311 --> 21:12.562
it all made sense.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.194
( barks )

21:15.194 --> 21:18.107
Princess,
I've decorated the patio

21:18.107 --> 21:19.529
with your favorite
toys and treats

21:19.529 --> 21:21.160
because there's
something very special

21:21.160 --> 21:22.532
I want to ask you.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.784
I love you
and the thought of not being

21:24.784 --> 21:26.746
with you forever
has been too much for me

21:26.746 --> 21:28.207
the last couple days.

21:28.207 --> 21:29.619
Princess,

21:29.619 --> 21:31.961
will you marry me?

21:35.415 --> 21:36.876
She said yes!

21:36.876 --> 21:40.129
She loves me.
We're getting married!

21:42.592 --> 21:44.844
Well, I'm engaged

21:44.844 --> 21:48.428
and it's the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

21:48.428 --> 21:50.810
The kids are really excited
about the engagement.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.563
Tyler even performed
a poem for us.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.314
Where will they register?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.197
This missus and this mister

21:58.197 --> 22:01.701
A department store
with a doggy door

22:01.701 --> 22:07.156
Or are you more fond of
Bed, Bone, and Beyond?

22:07.156 --> 22:10.950
That was
"If Dogs Could Get Married"

22:10.950 --> 22:13.753
Sign the petition
over by the muffins.

22:13.753 --> 22:16.666
But still no maple!
