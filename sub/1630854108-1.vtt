10:03.478 --> 10:05.063
- Is she here with you right now?
- No.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.356
Then get me out
of my fucking bra!

10:06.356 --> 10:07.691
- Okay, all right, all right. Wow.
- Jesus.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.610
Okay, here we go, all right?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.403
God, why this is really on here.
- Did you-- Can you--

10:11.403 --> 10:13.947
What are you, 15?
- Wait, I got it, I got it.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.157
There we are.

10:15.157 --> 10:15.991
Oh my god.

10:20.871 --> 10:21.705
Hi.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.207
I, I, I thought it would be weird

10:23.207 --> 10:25.334
if, uh, the first time we saw
each other was on set.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.960
That would be weird?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.088
Okay.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.091
So, thank you for that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're welcome.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.345
Oh, it's good to see you. You look good.

10:36.345 --> 10:40.057
- I do?
- Yeah, your, your head, it--
And your gray hairs.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.309
Yes, I'm, I'm in a,
I'm in a committed relationship.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.895
- Yeah, you said that.
- Sorry, um--

10:44.895 --> 10:46.480
How are you? Tell me everything.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.815
Oh, f-f-fantastic, yeah.
Doin' some theater.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.193
I got a couple of film projects
in the works--
- Uh-huh.

10:51.193 --> 10:55.572
and, uh... just had lunch
with Paul Thomas Anderson.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.367
- Exciting, exciting.
- Yeah, mm-hm. And, um, and, and you?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.202
I mean, how, how's life as a Duchess?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.496
- So fulfilling.
- Mm.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.499
It's cold and dark
for much of the year there,

11:05.499 --> 11:08.794
so our people really look to me
to be their warmth and light.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.004
Like the sun.

11:11.922 --> 11:15.133
Embarrassing when you
say it like that, but yes.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.095
To an entire nation of people,
I am like the sun.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.597
And your husband, the Duke?

11:20.597 --> 11:26.436
- My husband is
so sweet and so loving.
- Mm-hm. Mm, good, good.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.313
And so miserable that I'm here--

11:28.313 --> 11:30.399
- Of course.
- but he knows I don't
wanna be the kind of person

11:30.399 --> 11:32.025
to let everybody down.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.363
Know what I mean?

11:36.822 --> 11:40.033
Maybe we should talk
about the way things ended.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.577
Oh, you mean how they cancelled our show

11:41.577 --> 11:43.996
because you quit to go
and do a movie that nobody saw?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.163
I mean us.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.875
I get back from location,
you left the country to marry a Duke

11:47.875 --> 11:49.251
without so much as a goodbye.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.753
- We were broken up, remember?
- We broke up all the time.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.297
Bree, we got back together, we broke up.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.048
It's something we did.
- Why do you even care?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.009
To you I was always just some

11:57.009 --> 12:00.554
stupid, small-town pageant girl
who didn't go to college.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.471
How can you say that?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.807
Because you were always
giving me acting notes.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.684
I gave you notes to help you.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.186
Well, if I needed so much help,

12:07.186 --> 12:08.520
how come I was nominated

12:08.520 --> 12:11.607
for a People's Choice Award
and you weren't?

12:11.607 --> 12:15.819
Because the people fell
for your contrived, little snort laugh.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.946
Or because you were overacting.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.038
How... dare you.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.373
You know what?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.503
That wasn't fair.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.839
I'm lashing out because
you were always right.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.634
You were so fucking good all the time,

12:38.634 --> 12:42.304
and it just bothered me that the rest
of us couldn't compete with that.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.515
Wow.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.434
That's very--

12:49.645 --> 12:50.646
Thank you.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.151
And I'm reeling because, goddamnit,
all I can think about is kissing you.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.989
- I-I'm in a committed--
- Now who's the good actor?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.372
Hey, Kelly, can I get a touchup?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.807
Holy shit.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.394
Hey, can we get real for a second?

13:30.394 --> 13:31.937
Oh, I don't like the sound of this.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.273
I used to be pretty bummed out that,
when the show ended,

13:34.273 --> 13:35.899
I never heard from any of you guys again.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.236
I mean, you played my parents
and then you were just gone.

13:39.736 --> 13:44.324
But now that I'm an adult...
I just want you to know... that I get it.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.537
- Okay.
- You weren't my real dad.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.163
You were just playing my dad.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.458
- Right.
- So, I shouldn't have been disappointed

13:53.458 --> 13:56.044
that I never heard from you
after the show ended.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.171
Not even on my birthday.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.841
Well, I'm really not
into birthdays or kids.

14:00.841 --> 14:01.925
But you liked me, though.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.553
Sure, if that's how you
wanna remember it.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.347
- But I was so cute.
- Meh.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.392
Hey, Reed, you thought
I was a cute kid, right?

14:11.560 --> 14:15.230
You were an actor finding
the truth in your character,

14:15.230 --> 14:18.066
which is all that matters.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.943
That's a big pretentious no.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.406
Hi. Hi guys. I'm Hannah Korman.
I'm the new showrunner person.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.949
- Hannah! Oh gosh!
- Hey.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.786
The script is amazing.
You are brilliant. I love you already.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.122
Oh my god.
If I had you instead of my father,

14:32.122 --> 14:34.166
I could've saved thousands
on Xanax and rehab.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.335
And Xanax again, whoopsies.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.837
See, that's the voice that we need.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.547
Very cable, very streaming.

14:40.547 --> 14:44.426
And I can't tell you how much
I love the twist at the end,

14:44.426 --> 14:47.513
Lawrence's dark secret.
- Thank you. I'm so excited to be here.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.182
I've been obsessed with the show
for as long as I can remember,

14:50.182 --> 14:52.059
and I'm kind of obsessed with you guys.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.145
Like, Clay, your stand-up is so offensive

14:55.145 --> 14:56.980
it's amazing you haven't
been cancelled yet.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.607
Well, not for lack of trying.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.443
And, Reed, I actually saw you
in that production of <i>Twelfth Night</i>

15:01.443 --> 15:04.446
in Providence a couple years ago.
You were unbelievable.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.408
And, Zack,

15:11.370 --> 15:14.498
my little cousin has seen
some of your movies.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.376
Ah, sweet!
Another member of the Zack Pack.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.593
- Hey, Elaine, what's up?
- Hi, this is Elaine Kim from Hulu.

15:26.593 --> 15:30.013
- Mm-hm, that's why I said--
- We have a significant situation.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.515
Are you someplace you can talk?

15:31.515 --> 15:34.560
Um, cool. I'm with the cast right now.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.311
Yo, if that's your cousin,
I can say what's up.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.021
- Why would it-- No.
- Okay.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.107
Uh, let me call you back in two minutes.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.861
Uh, okay, I gotta run,
but it was so lovely meeting you guys.

15:43.861 --> 15:48.031
- You too. Oh.
- And can't wait to make some magic.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.283
Yes, yes, yes!

15:49.283 --> 15:51.326
Thank you so much, Hannah.
- I'll walk ya out.

15:51.326 --> 15:55.706
- Uh.
- So, which one of my films
is your cousin's favorite?

15:55.706 --> 15:59.126
Oh, um, something about you
being trapped underground?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.294
Oh, <i>Minor Miner.</i>

16:00.294 --> 16:03.297
I won best actor for that one
at the Magic Mountain Film Festival.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.131
Oh!

16:14.141 --> 16:16.643
So much hair.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.771
- God, I've gotten old.
- Wow.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.774
I'd pay anything to have
a 24-year-old ass.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.320
- Well, it only costs 300 bucks an hour.
- You'd know.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.365
- How you doin', Bree?
- Hey, honey. How are you?

16:30.365 --> 16:33.410
So good to see you.
Are you still doing your comedy?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.454
Yeah, what can I say? It's in my blood.

16:35.454 --> 16:38.165
Along with Hep C.
- Gross.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.584
I'm just glad you're still alive.
- Well, actually, true story,

16:40.584 --> 16:43.086
one crazy night I died for six minutes.

16:43.086 --> 16:46.882
- Your stand-up's not for everyone.
- Oh, that's funny, Duchess.

16:46.882 --> 16:49.384
You don't have to
call me that, honestly.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.219
Really, it's embarrassing.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.638
I was just telling my hair
and makeup people that I really--

16:52.638 --> 16:55.224
I need to be treated like
a regular person again.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.475
Hey, Bree.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.520
Could I have a sparkling water
with tiny bubbles, not coarse?

16:59.520 --> 17:00.395
What?

17:00.395 --> 17:02.856
A sparkling water
with tiny bubbles, not coarse.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.193
- No, it's, it's me, Zack.
- Zack.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.528
Zack Jackson.

17:07.903 --> 17:13.158
Oh, wow!
Zack Jackson all grown up.

17:13.158 --> 17:15.077
Whoa, weird.

17:15.077 --> 17:18.372
That's the exact title
of my soon-to-be-self-published memoir.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.166
I get real about my career,
my struggle with ADHD--

17:21.166 --> 17:23.585
Oh, cool!
Look at that picture of a barn.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.878
I can do a backflip.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.755
Hey, did you think I was cute
when I was a kid?

17:26.755 --> 17:29.383
Sure... First couple seasons.

17:29.383 --> 17:33.345
So, ladies and germs,
here's what we are recreating.

17:33.345 --> 17:37.850
Let's get into position.
Uh, you are there, and you're there.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.476
You know what to do.

17:41.562 --> 17:44.314
Uh-huh, oh, great.
Yeah, it's amazing.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.568
Okay, ha, everybody's hilarious.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.612
Reed, give us the, uh,
the Lawrence annoyed look.

17:50.612 --> 17:54.783
- Lawrence-- I, I am.
- No, uh, with the arms. Hm.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.703
Oh, hm, I-I'd rather not.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.789
It's, uh, it's, it's too broad.
- Yeah, but we gotta match the old photo.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.083
Yeah, but nobody does that in real life.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.295
And, uh, the show is much
more sophisticated this time.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.796
Totally different tone.

18:07.796 --> 18:11.216
So, this is more of an internal thing
when I'm, when I'm--

18:12.593 --> 18:13.594
See?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.180
You don't look annoyed.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.015
Well, trust me, I'm gettin' there.

18:18.015 --> 18:19.516
- Dude, it's a photo.
- Can you just do it?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.310
No, it is a slippery slope.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.978
It starts with one corny photo,

18:22.978 --> 18:24.855
and ends with a bucket
of spaghetti on my head.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.232
I liked that episode:
"Mission Impastable."

18:27.232 --> 18:29.776
That was funny.
Hey, you guys know
where I can find the actors?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.613
- We're the grownup actors.
- Awesome, way to go.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.823
Uh, they told me to tell you guys
to go to the showrunner's office.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.660
- Why?
- 'Cause it's my job
to do stuff like that.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.579
It's my first day. Still figuring it out.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.539
Perfect. We will ask Hannah.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.791
She is the showrunner,
she sets the tone,

18:44.791 --> 18:47.419
and I highly doubt that she wants, "Mm."

18:47.419 --> 18:50.714
There it is.
-  Do not use that!

18:58.055 --> 19:00.057
Hi Hannah--
- I'm sorry, I can't.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.685
Is that my favorite family?

19:04.645 --> 19:05.729
Gordon.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.440
- Gordon?
- Hey, it's me.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.068
Uh, [stammers] what are,
what are you doing here?

19:11.068 --> 19:13.153
I'm here to save the day.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.780
I finally read this new script.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.740
You got jokes with no punchlines,

19:16.740 --> 19:20.953
over-complicated characters,
social commentary, blah, blah, blah, blah.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.079
I told her I'm gonna fix it.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.915
I-I'm sorry, maybe you don't know this,
but Hannah's our new showrunner.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.000
Apparently not, 'cause she just quit.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.502
- What?
- I'm here.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.921
- Finally, the guy with the sandwiches.
- Gordon?

19:30.921 --> 19:33.215
No, it's me, Zack.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.218
What? Zack? No, oh my!

19:36.885 --> 19:39.221
You used to be so cute.
- See? Told you.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.558
And, Reed, I notice you got hit
by the, uh, the great recession.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.726
Hey, that's a gold mine right there.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.145
Put in a bunch of bald jokes
about Lawrence.

19:47.145 --> 19:50.023
No! No, no, no, we're, we're
not gonna do that, uh, Gordon.
That's funny. I like that.

19:50.023 --> 19:54.319
- We, We really like the new script.
- No, nobody likes this.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.445
You know what the problem is?

19:55.445 --> 19:59.867
See, now the world is just a mess
and people need comfort, right?

19:59.867 --> 20:02.369
They don't want kale salad,
let's give 'em mac and cheese.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.330
Gordon, the characters
finally sound real.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.957
What are you talkin' about?

20:06.957 --> 20:10.419
Lawrence has always been real.
It's based on me.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.212
You know the episode
where you, you dropped,

20:12.212 --> 20:14.256
you dropped the, the wallet
in the open casket?

20:14.256 --> 20:15.424
Yeah.
- That happened.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.551
Not to me, but I knew
a guy that happened to.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.345
And that was very, very funny in 2002,

20:20.345 --> 20:22.639
but it's been 20 years
and the show needs to change.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.224
It's gonna change, believe me.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.643
This time, Cody gets
his own cute little kid.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.104
Ah, hell yeah! That's so sick.
Right?

20:29.104 --> 20:30.439
A kid? No kid.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.025
I must've spent 10-grand
on that fuckin' swear jar.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.652
Well, you can't do a family show
without a cute kid.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.653
We did before.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.448
Wait, Gordon, you can't do that
because then that would make me a grandma.

20:39.448 --> 20:40.991
Oh boy, I hadn't even thought of that.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.619
Put in a bunch of old lady
jokes about Josie.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.871
Yeah, like a, a walk-in tub and stuff.

20:45.871 --> 20:49.082
No, I'm barely in my forties! Shut up.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.919
Okay, um, I'm sorry, Gordon, um,

20:51.919 --> 20:56.673
we are only doing the version
that we have signed on for.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.217
Really?

20:58.217 --> 20:59.051
Yeah.

20:59.885 --> 21:00.886
I see.

21:02.888 --> 21:06.600
And if we don't... then what?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.936
You gonna quit... again?

21:09.353 --> 21:11.688
Hm? Is that what's gonna happen?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.273
What, you're all gonna quit this time?

21:13.273 --> 21:14.942
- Oh, um.
- Well.
- Well.

21:14.942 --> 21:18.153
Not necessarily, but--
- Yes, we are all going to quit.

21:18.153 --> 21:18.987
Reed.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.658
Who the fuck do you think you are?

21:23.450 --> 21:27.871
This is my show.
I own the rights. I'm in charge.

21:27.871 --> 21:31.500
So, if that's not okay with you,
then-- Hey, you know what?

21:31.500 --> 21:33.836
Fuck your quitting,
I'll just fold up the tent,

21:33.836 --> 21:35.379
shave the bearded lady.

21:35.379 --> 21:38.507
I'll be very happy to go back
to my beautiful home in Bel Air.

21:38.507 --> 21:41.718
So, you can tell me right now,
you're in or you're out.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.849
- I'm scared.
- Okay.

21:46.849 --> 21:49.726
- What are you doing?
- We need to apologize to him.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.686
Yeah.

21:50.686 --> 21:54.857
I'm hearing you, I'm listening,
and I got this completely under control.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.484
All right? Just trust me.

22:03.574 --> 22:04.616
Well, look at you.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.744
Actin' like you A-Rod or some shit

22:08.412 --> 22:11.081
when I'm the only ruthless
muthafucka standin' here.

22:11.081 --> 22:14.376
- W-What is he doing?
- I'll tell you what the fuck I'm doing.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.128
You bring back the girl,

22:16.128 --> 22:19.464
or you ain't never gon' see
this family ever again.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.678
Let's roll, y'all.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.265
Dis muthafucka.

22:28.265 --> 22:29.725
Reed!

22:33.520 --> 22:36.690
- Are you out of your mind?!

22:36.690 --> 22:38.025
- Okay.
- What the fuck, Reed?!

22:38.025 --> 22:39.693
Okay, I admit the character took over.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.778
- Will he really shut down the show?
- Nah, nah. I think he's bluffing.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.031
You think he's bluffing?!
What if he's not?!

22:44.031 --> 22:47.242
What if this all ends because you
pretended to be a ruthless motherfucker?

22:47.242 --> 22:50.579
- Why are you the one freaking out?
- Because I need this show!

22:50.579 --> 22:52.289
Oh my god, are you kiddin' me?

22:52.289 --> 22:54.291
You're, You're the last one
who needs this show.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.751
You can just go back to being a Duchess.

22:55.751 --> 22:57.127
- I can't.
- Why not?

22:57.127 --> 22:59.671
Because I'm not a Duchess anymore!

23:00.547 --> 23:02.633
Anders?
- Bree!

23:02.633 --> 23:04.468
Ingrid's not at her desk.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.596
- Oh, what, uh, what brings you here?
-  It happened again.

23:07.596 --> 23:11.225
I went into the village to try
to connect with these stoic people

23:11.225 --> 23:14.478
and someone threw a pinecone at my head
and called me a <i>Klün-Hore.</i>

23:14.853 --> 23:17.272
- That means Clown Whore.
- I know what it means!

23:17.272 --> 23:20.859
I'm trying to be a good Duchess,
but they just don't accept outsiders.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.528
Perhaps we can talk about this later.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.404
No, I wanna talk about it now!

23:24.404 --> 23:26.949
I want you to-- Oh my god,
are you not wearing pants?!

23:26.949 --> 23:29.743
-  Well, let's not, uh--
- Is that Ingrid down there?

23:29.743 --> 23:32.120
We're in love, <i>Klün-Hore!</i>

23:32.120 --> 23:33.205
Uh, darling, I, I think that--

23:33.205 --> 23:35.666
Go to hell, Anders,
and fuck off, Ingrid!

23:35.666 --> 23:37.292
I never liked you!

23:38.126 --> 23:40.754
Well, I did, but I don't anymore!

23:42.714 --> 23:45.050
My marriage is over and I'm broke.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.885
You're broke?
Well, how did that happen?

23:46.885 --> 23:49.763
Fjordstad divorce law.
They're on the Kettle System.

23:50.806 --> 23:53.267
A woman can only take
what she can fit in a kettle.

23:54.643 --> 23:55.644
I'm so sorry.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.938
You guys all have
things to fall back on.

23:57.938 --> 24:02.109
I don't... I am so pathetic.

24:02.109 --> 24:05.571
You wanna hear pathetic?
My life's a fuckin' mess.

24:05.571 --> 24:08.365
Three months ago,
Andy Dick told me I was outta control.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.408
Ooh.

24:09.992 --> 24:11.910
Yeah, I got fired
from my last teen movie.

24:12.911 --> 24:16.957
Apparently, "guys in high school
don't have hair plugs."

24:17.624 --> 24:19.459
Well, um,

24:21.295 --> 24:24.006
as I am the actor who left this troupe

24:24.006 --> 24:25.632
for greener pastures,

24:25.632 --> 24:29.887
you might enjoy learning that
my last paying job over a year ago

24:30.429 --> 24:33.557
was the voice... of a hemorrhoid.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.768
When I was 17,

24:36.768 --> 24:40.647
I stole $2,000 worth of Air Jordans
from a Foot Locker.

24:41.607 --> 24:43.025
Not what we're doin', man.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.319
- No.
- Okay, c-cool.

24:45.319 --> 24:46.945
You guys left this in there.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.244
Remember how excited we were

24:54.244 --> 24:57.289
when this was the billboard
of us on Sunset Boulevard?

24:57.289 --> 24:59.666
We raced there at lunch to see it.

24:59.666 --> 25:03.045
And we posed exactly the same way
hoping someone would notice.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.797
Remember that guy asked you
to autograph his t-shirt?

25:05.797 --> 25:09.718
Oh god. I remember that was
the first time I ever signed an autograph.

25:09.718 --> 25:12.429
Granted, he thought I was Damon Wayans.

25:12.429 --> 25:13.847
Yeah, I don't remember any of this.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.475
- You were sick.
- You were at school.
- We couldn't find you.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.103
Okay, fuck it.

25:20.896 --> 25:24.399
Where are you going?
- Back to Gordon's to eat shit.

25:24.399 --> 25:28.403
I screwed you guys out of this once,
I'm not gonna do it again.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.448
Yo, see you guys later.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.325
Gotta go take this box to Hannah's house.

25:33.325 --> 25:34.493
Reed, wait!

25:36.453 --> 25:39.456
Hi.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.668
- What the f--
- Hi, um, I'm Bree.

25:42.668 --> 25:44.920
We haven't met yet.
- Yeah, I'm a big fan.

25:44.920 --> 25:50.050
Oh... thanks, that's so sweet.
What was I saying?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.927
What the hell are you guys doing here?

25:51.927 --> 25:54.304
- Oh--
- Hannah, we need you to stay.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.472
Guys, I can't.

25:55.472 --> 25:58.267
I-I would love to, but Gordon
wasn't supposed to be there, okay?

25:58.267 --> 25:59.768
So, it's just-- It's a non-starter.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.145
I don't think you understand.
I need this.

26:02.145 --> 26:05.482
I need somewhere to go during the day,
or bad shit finds me.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.693
Hannah, we all need this.

26:09.987 --> 26:13.031
No, no. I can't, I can't.
I can't work with him every day.

26:13.031 --> 26:16.577
He's just-- He's so--
- Stubborn and he's narcissistic.

26:16.577 --> 26:19.454
We know.
All right, we're tired of the drama.

26:19.454 --> 26:23.083
I promise you, we will always,
always be in your corner.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.795
Yeah, and help you fight
his terrible ideas, like adding a kid.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.005
Or making me a grandma.

26:28.005 --> 26:30.174
You're saying--
Are you, Are you saying you'd support me?

26:30.174 --> 26:31.842
- Absolutely.
- No matter what?

26:31.842 --> 26:33.844
No matt--
- Oh my god! Fuck that guy.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.471
I mean, that would infuriate him.

26:36.471 --> 26:39.766
Come on, Hannah...
We need you to <i>Step--</i>

26:39.766 --> 26:41.310
Oh, don't say it.
<i>Right.</i>

26:41.310 --> 26:42.394
Please kill me.
<i>Up.</i>

26:42.394 --> 26:43.228
Ugh.

26:49.735 --> 26:50.569
Okay.

26:50.569 --> 26:51.445
Yes?
I'll do it.

26:51.445 --> 26:52.738
I'll try.

26:52.738 --> 26:54.072
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.200
Oh, you're the best. Oh, thank you.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.410
And I-- You know, I got
a little ramped up there.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.786
I promise you, Gordon,

26:59.786 --> 27:01.330
he's not that bad
when you get to know him.
- No.

27:01.330 --> 27:04.750
Yeah.
- Oh, I got to know him pretty well
for about seven years

27:04.750 --> 27:06.460
until he dropped me off
at ballet class one time

27:06.460 --> 27:08.962
and he started flirting
with my super-skinny teacher.

27:08.962 --> 27:12.049
And then he moved in with her
and her super creepy son, Seth,

27:12.049 --> 27:15.761
and then he created a television show
all about his new step-family

27:15.761 --> 27:19.014
that acted like
his daughter never existed.

27:21.058 --> 27:26.813
Um... are you telling us
that Gordon is your father?

27:27.147 --> 27:31.693
Yeah... but I guess my childhood
didn't give him enough material, right?

27:31.693 --> 27:34.321
Maybe my scoliosis brace,
and my cystic acne,

27:34.321 --> 27:36.114
and going to the father-daughter dance

27:36.114 --> 27:38.742
with my mother's hairdresser
wasn't funny enough for him.

27:39.660 --> 27:42.162
But we're not gonna let him
write me out this time.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.539
Oh shit.

27:43.539 --> 27:46.416
So, the big twist
at the end of the pilot--

27:46.416 --> 27:50.712
Dear Lord,
Lawrence's dark secret is you.

27:51.421 --> 27:54.633
- I'm here.

27:55.843 --> 27:56.677
What'd I miss?

27:56.677 --> 27:59.304
♪ "Re-Do" by Modern Baseball playing ♪

27:59.304 --> 28:01.723

28:40.429 --> 28:41.889
Bree, you missed your cue!

28:41.889 --> 28:43.765
Shit. This is your fault!

28:45.058 --> 28:46.685
That's not the actress
playing your daughter, is it?

28:46.685 --> 28:47.644
I wouldn't think so.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.147
Her character description was
frazzled, unkempt, and zaftig.

28:50.147 --> 28:54.151
A special welcome to the newest member
of our cast, Timberly Fox.

28:54.610 --> 28:58.989
Timberly made quite a splash
on a reality dating show called--

28:58.989 --> 29:01.450
<i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>
<i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

29:02.618 --> 29:04.953
Your mom still comes to set
with you every day.

29:04.953 --> 29:06.371
She's been coming
to set with me my whole life.

29:06.371 --> 29:09.082
Dude, that's creepy.
- Could you say something to my mom?

29:09.082 --> 29:10.167
Yeah, what the fuck.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.628
ZACK'S MOM:
Come in!

29:13.629 --> 29:15.255
- Oh boy.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.424
- What if Zack finds out?
- Finds what out?

29:17.424 --> 29:20.260
Uh, that I couldn't
talk to your mom yet.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.179
- Too hard, huh?
- No, no, I wouldn't say that.

29:22.179 --> 29:23.305
Not that.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.599
Did you read the rewrite?
They added a scene.

29:25.599 --> 29:26.975
We're in bed.
- Oh!

29:26.975 --> 29:28.268
That's actually kind of racy

29:28.268 --> 29:30.062
compared to how tame
we had to keep it on network.

29:30.771 --> 29:32.439
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

29:32.439 --> 29:33.774
Doesn't feel like nothing!

29:33.774 --> 29:36.026
I think you're confused
because of our history

29:36.026 --> 29:37.694
and I think you
still have feelings for me.

29:37.694 --> 29:40.239
I do not still have feelings for you.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.074
I am in a committed relationship.

29:42.074 --> 29:45.953
Right, with "Nora" who's a "real person"
in "New York City."

29:46.411 --> 29:48.121
Well this can't be good.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.040
Guess what?
I'm on mushrooms.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.001
I'm coming to get you.
Tell me exactly what you see.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.878
When my eyes are open,
I see a fence.

29:54.878 --> 29:56.463
When they're closed, dragons.

29:56.839 --> 29:59.424
Bree? [groans] Shit.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.510
- Die, dragon!
- Whoa!

30:02.636 --> 30:04.471
You have this superpower, man.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.807
You actually have the rare gift
of being fuckin' funny.

30:06.807 --> 30:08.392
You could make millions of people laugh.

30:08.392 --> 30:10.727
And to put that out into the world,

30:10.727 --> 30:13.438
that is as good and honorable thing
as a man can do.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.774
Come on, guys, let's bring it in.
"Step Right Up" on three.

30:15.774 --> 30:18.193
- No reason to do that.
- All right.

30:18.193 --> 30:20.153
One, two, three, "Step Right Up"!

30:21.196 --> 30:23.115
The comedy cavalry has arrived.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.408
Good morning!
Sorry we're late.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.660
