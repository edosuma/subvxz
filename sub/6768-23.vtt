WEBVTT

00:05.922 --> 00:07.465
{\an3}Sorry.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.967
Ten minutes isn't
officially late.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.760
I was early.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.470
{\an3}How early?
You already ate?

00:12.554 --> 00:13.805
I was hungry.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.099
Nat.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.101
{\an1}Two double espressos, please.
Make mine a single.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.602
Three cups of coffee?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
Two singles, please.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.274
Watching out for
my drug intake?

00:24.357 --> 00:25.775
I'm just being supportive.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.652
Okay, as long as
that's all it is.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.404
Promise.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.947
How's the old job hunt going?

00:31.030 --> 00:33.616
Terrible.
No one's interested.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.660
It's like they can't wait
to get me out the door.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.911
I can't believe this.
I mean, you created

00:36.995 --> 00:38.621
your own clothing line.
And stole

00:38.705 --> 00:39.497
someone else's concepts.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
{\an1}Only 'cause you were
taking too many pills.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.127
{\an3}Another reason why no one's
lining up to hire me.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.129
Listen to me.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.839
You got to keep trying.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.925
I appreciate your support.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.260
I really do.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.471
{\an3}But the fact
of the matter is,

00:54.554 --> 00:56.806
I threw away a really great job.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.725
Now, I may never
get hired again.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.692
What do you mean
I'm not getting the child?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.986
I told you when you applied
to be a foster mom

01:10.069 --> 01:12.155
that it would take time for
the application to be approved.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.656
But I found him.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.991
{\an1}Which is why the couple
getting custody

01:15.074 --> 01:16.493
want to thank you.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.994
But I saved his life.

01:18.077 --> 01:20.997
Yeah, you did, Kel,
but maybe it's time

01:21.080 --> 01:23.124
{\an1}to let him
get on with it.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.503
{\an1}Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we're here.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.506
Brandon, Kelly,
this is Kyle Vossler.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.840
{\an1}This is the foster parent
I told you about.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.550
{\an3}Congratulations.
Thanks.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
You, uh...

01:34.260 --> 01:35.720
you're my hero.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.806
{\an3}Well, I didn't
really do anything.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.516
No, no, you...

01:39.599 --> 01:41.601
Well, you just made
our lives complete.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.353
Hi.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.022
We named him Raphael.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.982
Raphael, that's a great name.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.359
{\an1}He was a,

01:49.442 --> 01:50.527
an angel wasn't he?

01:50.610 --> 01:51.903
KYLE:
Someday we just want

01:51.986 --> 01:54.531
{\an1}to be able to tell him
how he came to us.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.282
{\an4}MAN:
And we didn't want
to be talking about

01:56.366 --> 01:57.700
some mysterious Lady X.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.830
I thought that you were
just the foster parents.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.500
The county has
a fost-adopt program

02:05.583 --> 02:08.044
that allows foster parents
to apply for custody.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.380
{\an4}MAN:
But still, making it
this far is a huge win.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.882
The stories that we could tell
you about the approval process

02:12.966 --> 02:14.509
would just curl your hair.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.054
You know, the obstacles
that you guys had to overcome

02:18.137 --> 02:20.598
would probably make a great
story for my newspaper.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.517
{\an1}Please. Don't get
him started.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.269
{\an3}They actually had
to be convinced

02:24.352 --> 02:25.728
{\an3}that we could
nurture a child.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.564
{\an3}Can you?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.610
We came here
to thank you.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.237
I don't mean to offend you.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.614
My first concern is
for this baby.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.742
Our baby.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.579
How are you going to raise him?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.747
What, do you mean is he
going to be exposed

02:44.831 --> 02:46.583
to show tunes and makeup?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.459
Gene...
I think we should be going.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.795
You haven't answered
my question.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.006
We've answered questions
like yours for years.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.259
Now we have Raphael.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.886
We don't have to anymore.

{\an5}JANET:
<i>I'm going to go out</i>
<i>for some bagels.</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:09.559
You guys want one?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.560
Yeah. Sesame, thanks.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.520
{\an3}Is that my interview?
Mm-hmm.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.731
{\an6}Thanks.
I didn't know gays adopting
was so controversial.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.524
{\an3}Till last night,
neither did I.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.068
{\an3}Steve, I know this
is just a first draft,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.570
but there's printing
on the back of this.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.780
It's recycling.
Oh.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.451
Before I forget,
this is your invitation

05:26.534 --> 05:28.995
{\an3}to the Southern California
Small Press Association

05:29.078 --> 05:30.788
awards luncheon on
that's on Friday.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.540
And, uh, when you win,

05:32.623 --> 05:33.958
remember the little people.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.209
And you are?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.586
Ha, ha.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.463
{\an3}Janet, just get
three bagels, okay?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.464
We don't need
half a dozen.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.424
{\an1}BRANDON:
Hey, you know, Steve,

05:41.507 --> 05:42.592
they sent us four tickets.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.593
Why don't you invite Jill?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.886
Oh. (laughs)

05:44.969 --> 05:45.970
That's not her thing.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.430
I was thinking Janet maybe.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.598
Oh, because with Jill,

05:48.681 --> 05:50.099
you're still
pretending to be Ted.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.226
Well, that's who
she's in love with, right?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.352
Why spoil the fantasy?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.313
And you're only doing that
for her benefit of course?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.606
{\an3}Exactly.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.441
You are one of the great
humanitarians.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.318
Thank you.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.572
{\an1}Recycling,
bagel-counting,

06:04.655 --> 06:06.491
{\an1}going for a little
too much workplace ambiance...

06:06.574 --> 06:08.284
{\an1}Correct me if I'm wrong,
but (sniffs),

06:08.367 --> 06:09.452
I smell money trouble.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.328
Well, you're wrong.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.288
You smell <i> huge</i> money problems.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.456
I don't get it, Steve.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.457
Couple months ago,
we were doing great.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.167
{\an3}Advertising revenue
is seasonal, Brandon.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.461
Big bucks in the fall,
nada in the New Year.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.962
Well, how bad is it?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.173
Unless we get a big advertiser,

06:22.256 --> 06:24.258
our next issue
could be our last.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.427
Which is why I've made
an executive decision.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.845
To work in the dark?

06:27.929 --> 06:30.139
{\an1}To take cigarette ads.
We are not

06:30.223 --> 06:31.641
going to promote
anything that kills people.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.809
It's a legal product.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.811
That kills people.
It comes

06:34.894 --> 06:36.270
{\an3}with a warning label.
Not good enough.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.063
We can't do it.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.898
Well, what else can we do,
Brandon?

06:45.655 --> 06:46.823
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Flight 29 from Buffalo...

06:46.906 --> 06:48.449
{\an3}VALERIE:
Have I mentioned I could

06:48.533 --> 06:49.826
kill Brandon for this?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.452
She called and asked
how you were doing.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.496
{\an4}What did you want him
to do, lie to her?
Desperately.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.580
I mean, what does she think,

06:54.664 --> 06:55.998
{\an1}I need her support
or something?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.125
So you don't?

06:57.208 --> 06:58.501
{\an1}You know what?
Her idea of support is me

06:58.584 --> 07:01.003
holding her purse while
she shops at Saks, okay?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.714
{\an1}Hi, honey!
Hey.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.592
It's so good to see you.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.844
Oh, hi.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.011
Oh. Give me that.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.847
Okay. How are you?

07:10.930 --> 07:11.973
Amazingly well.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.850
Is that so?

07:13.933 --> 07:16.519
Oh, she's amazingly strong.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.521
{\an3}I wonder where
she gets that from?

07:18.604 --> 07:21.149
I heard your song on the radio
the other day.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.526
{\an4}I couldn't believe it!
That's 'cause it's
too good to be true.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.653
{\an4}Well, the business
side of it stinks,
but the music's great.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.989
{\an3}It still can be.
Val, I thought

07:28.072 --> 07:30.032
we were past this?
Let's not make a scene, okay?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.368
Fine.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.495
And the part about me
being strong?

07:34.579 --> 07:35.663
I get that on my own.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.337
They're good.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.506
Yeah, all the better
to wallpaper my bathroom with.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.383
Donna, designers aren't
buying your stuff,

07:47.466 --> 07:48.718
so make it yourself.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.386
I mean, what do you need?

07:50.469 --> 07:53.764
Well, I need someone
to help me cut a few samples.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
Then I'd have to sell them,
and if they sold--

07:55.641 --> 07:58.019
oh, which they probably
won't, right.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.103
I need materials,

07:59.187 --> 08:02.064
{\an6}seamstresses,
workplace...
Got it.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.108
{\an3}Got what?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.527
I'll help you
get the samples out,

08:06.611 --> 08:07.820
get them sold.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.488
I'll even put up the cash.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.909
That's really nice,
but I couldn't.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.119
I'm telling you I have the best
people to work on this.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.959
I don't know.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.545
Mixing business with pleasure...

08:24.629 --> 08:27.423
It's all pleasure.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.471
KELLY:
<i>Can you honestly say</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.806
that what you're doing
is better for Raphael

08:35.890 --> 08:38.058
than putting him in a home
with a dad and a mom?

08:38.142 --> 08:39.519
Gene and Kyle have been

08:39.602 --> 08:40.811
on the waiting list
for two years.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.480
How come every time I ask
a tough question

08:42.563 --> 08:43.606
I don't get an answer?

08:43.688 --> 08:45.233
We've been to their home.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.443
We've interviewed
their family and friends.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.487
Every indication
is they would

08:49.570 --> 08:53.032
provide Raphael with a loving,
safe environment.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.617
We can't ask for more than that.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.160
Well, I think you can.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.412
I think you have
the responsibility to.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.290
I'll call you back.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.417
Hello, honey.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.169
Dad, what are you doing here?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.130
Are you supposed to be here?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.465
{\an3}Believe it
or not, I got

09:09.548 --> 09:11.467
{\an1}time off for good behavior.
I would have

09:11.550 --> 09:12.385
come to pick you up.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.346
No, no, no, I, uh,
wanted to surprise you.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.473
How are you feeling?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.518
I may not look it, but, uh,
I've never felt better.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.811
Just being able

09:21.894 --> 09:23.020
to walk through a door.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
I wish you would've called.

09:25.064 --> 09:29.068
Maybe I was afraid that you...

09:29.151 --> 09:30.361
If you had time,

09:30.444 --> 09:32.321
{\an3}you would think
of some good reason

09:32.405 --> 09:33.990
why I shouldn't
come down here.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.866
I'm glad you're here.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.412
So what are you going to do?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.455
Your letters...

09:41.539 --> 09:43.582
they talked about

{\an1}So, uh, how are
your parents,

Blake and Emily?

{\an1}How are they handling
his retirement?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.392
{\an3}Great.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.977
{\an3}It's like they're
rediscovering each other.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.021
{\an1}Your letters were
so descriptive,

10:05.104 --> 10:05.855
I feel like I know you.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.691
{\an3}I feel the same way
about you, Ted.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.026
How's Sam?

10:10.109 --> 10:11.527
"Sam"?

10:11.610 --> 10:13.529
I wish I was as close
with my brother.

10:13.612 --> 10:14.530
Sam's great.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.365
I just saw him the other day.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.326
We went on a hike.
He's out of the wheelchair?

10:18.409 --> 10:19.577
I didn't tell you?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.203
It's a miracle.
He's up, he's dancing.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.205
How's Jane taking the news?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.542
Jane's taking the news like
she should be taking the news.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.003
I just hope
they patch things up.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.464
I mean, hers was
a crime of passion.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.509
Uh, oh my,
look what time it is.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.011

10:45.186 --> 10:46.604
I am a little.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.314
{\an1}I'm more comfortable
talking about you.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.732
I got that from your letters.

Never.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.913

19:06.854 --> 19:08.939
That was so sweet.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.816
That's the kind of guy I am.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.654
Here's where I coyly ask
if you'd like to come in.

19:15.737 --> 19:19.324
And I say, "Yes, very much."

19:33.005 --> 19:36.508
I've been, um,
thinking about this

19:36.592 --> 19:37.593
from the moment we met.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.720
{\an3}Me, too.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.267
From before, really.
What?

19:45.350 --> 19:47.019
From that incredible letter

19:47.102 --> 19:48.270
where you told me
all your fantasies.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.815
Oh, that?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.151
And now, I'm going to make
them all come true.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.111
I've never wanted to say
the name of any man

19:56.194 --> 19:58.572
I've ever been with before.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.032
But I want to say yours, Ted.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.828
Ted. Ted.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.829
Ted...

20:05.913 --> 20:07.623
(grunts):
Ted.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.333
{\an3}Um...

20:09.416 --> 20:11.084
I'm sorry.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.794
What's wrong?

20:12.878 --> 20:13.962
Is it something I said, Ted?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.965
No, no, it's not you.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.759
It's, I'm...

20:18.842 --> 20:20.844
I have to go.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.433
I have to go.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.691
Hey.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.985
Hi.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.904
You ready to go?
Uh, just about.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.199
{\an1}So what'd you
think of my article?

20:42.282 --> 20:44.701
Well, it's your job

20:44.785 --> 20:46.662
{\an3}to tell both sides
of the story.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.664
{\an3}I can't help it
if I don't agree.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.667
The experts I talked to said
that Raphael would be fine.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.710
Not without a maternal figure
in his life.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.836
I don't think so.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.671
Oh, so it's

20:55.754 --> 20:58.006
not their sexuality
you're opposed to,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.841
{\an1}it's their gender.
Brandon...

20:59.925 --> 21:01.677
{\an3}I don't want to argue
about this, okay?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.470
I'm just curious
about something.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.138
If this was two gay women

21:05.222 --> 21:06.515
would you feel the same way?

21:06.598 --> 21:09.309
{\an1}I don't want to argue.
Fine.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.519
We have to get going.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.980
I told my dad that we would
meet him at the After Dark.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.022
How's he doing?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.691
He says he's changed.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.901
{\an3}Kel...
Brandon.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.029
I wanted to say that I'm sorry

21:21.113 --> 21:23.907
for not asking your opinion
about the baby.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.201
It was really
selfish of me.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.871
I need your help here.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.999
You got it.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.714
Kelly?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.465
Leanne.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.758
What are you doing here?

21:41.842 --> 21:44.052
I want my baby.
I want Erik.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.346
I really can't talk about this.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.724
Then take me to the lady
at Social Services, please.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.142
Help me get my baby back.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.742
{\an3}Come on, Donna,
what do they know?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.243
Apparently, the same thing
as everyone else.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.870
Whoa!
Ooh, sorry.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.622
Okay, watch,
I'll prove this to you.

22:14.332 --> 22:16.418
Nat, can I show you something?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.295
{\an1}Uh, yeah, sure.
Okay. Will you look

22:18.378 --> 22:20.380
at my designs and
tell me honestly

22:20.464 --> 22:21.590
what you think.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.425
I don't know.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.634
See?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.430
B-But these are
spring colors.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.431
{\an1}I'm...

22:29.514 --> 22:30.974
kind of an autumn guy.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.601
Look, we're not giving up.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.812
{\an1}Why not? Everyone's
given up on us.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.149
{\an4}You're the one who told me
you have to be patient.
It's just,

22:39.232 --> 22:41.777
{\an1}every time we get turned down,
it just reminds me

22:41.860 --> 22:44.279
{\an1}what a great setup I had
over at Child's Play.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.322
Yeah, it was a great job.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.783
{\an3}I mean, no questions asked,
it was a great gig.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.242
It'll happen again.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.786
What if it doesn't?

22:50.869 --> 22:54.247
{\an1}I mean, come on, we both
know that that was a fluke.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.749
{\an1}I mean, without
their connections

22:55.832 --> 22:57.584
with the department store...

22:57.667 --> 23:00.796
Are there any stops
we haven't made yet?

23:00.879 --> 23:02.339
Nope, none today.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.299
{\an1}Just Mayalee's tomorrow,
and that's it.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.259
{\an3}Mayalee's?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.969
{\an3}No problem.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.763
No problem? What...

23:09.846 --> 23:12.182
{\an1}Are you and I sitting
in the same meetings, or...?

23:12.265 --> 23:14.309
{\an1}They're gonna love you.
Based on what?

23:14.392 --> 23:15.811
I don't know-- they're
gonna love you, though.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
I say we get out of here,

23:17.395 --> 23:18.980
{\an3}we get our skates
and go to the beach.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.942
No, no, I don't think so.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.318
It'll take your
mind off work.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.695
I'm tired.
Can you take me home?

23:39.918 --> 23:43.672
{\an1}I'm so happy you decided
to take Erik back.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.216
{\an3}Even though you
offered to take him?

23:46.299 --> 23:48.009
He belongs with you.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.179
{\an1}When he couldn't have that,
my heart went out to him.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.514
He's so precious.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.516
{\an1}I'm glad you finally
realized that.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.811
{\an3}So am I-- considering
the alternative.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.521
The alternative?

23:59.604 --> 24:04.025
The idea of my boy being
raised by a couple of queers.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.528
I... I met Gene and Kyle.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.321
They seem really nice.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.366
(chuckles):
Yeah, to raise a ballerina.

24:11.449 --> 24:15.162
You said that you talked
to your mom about the baby.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.372
Did you talk to her about this?

24:17.455 --> 24:19.291
She's the one who showed me
the newspaper article

24:19.374 --> 24:21.209
about what those guys
were trying to do.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.085
That's how you found out

24:22.169 --> 24:23.503
about Gene and Kyle,
through the paper?

24:23.587 --> 24:24.671
Without that article,

24:24.754 --> 24:26.214
Erik would have been raised gay.

24:26.298 --> 24:30.218
You're not raised gay,
you're born that way.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.387
Wh-What would <i> you</i> do

24:32.471 --> 24:34.222
if you were me?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.891
Would you let
those guys raise your kid?

24:35.974 --> 24:38.935
I wouldn't leave my kid
on a doorstep.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.026
But if you did,
would you let them?

24:46.109 --> 24:48.528
(door opens)

24:48.612 --> 24:50.280
Leanne.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.089
Oh, hey.
Hi.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.424
How'd your date go?

25:09.507 --> 25:12.302
Well, it...
it didn't, really.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.763
If it's because you told her the
truth, then I'm proud of you.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.098
Oh, no, no, she wanted to...

25:17.182 --> 25:19.267
(chuckles):
have sex.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.101
With Ted.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.061
Yeah. Which is why

25:21.144 --> 25:22.437
I couldn't go through with it.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.563
Well, good for you.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.608
Oh, hey, listen,
the ad guy was back.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.068
Brandon's not too pleased.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.279
Thanks for the warning.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.752
Maybe I wasn't
clear, Steve.

25:45.835 --> 25:49.422
{\an1}I'm not gonna edit a paper
that runs cigarette ads.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.299
You were clear.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.137
Well, I guess
there's nothing left to say.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.431
That's right,
bail on me, go ahead.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.810
Oh, no, this isn't on me,
Steve, it's on you.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.561
No, this is on <i> us.</i>

26:03.645 --> 26:05.146
This is <i> our</i> failure.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.481
Not <i> mine.</i>

26:06.564 --> 26:08.692
You remember that
when you get that award.

26:08.775 --> 26:09.985
<i>We</i> failed.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.486
Fine.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.405
It's on us.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.327
Am I missing something?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.663
Paper's gonna close.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.164
Yeah, Steve,
the paper's gonna close,

26:23.248 --> 26:24.874
and we're both gonna move on.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.293
No, you're gonna move on.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.295
You always do.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.172
When we graduated college,
this paper saved me.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.716
And you saved the paper.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.593
It's not that big a deal, Steve.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.643
(sighs)

26:43.727 --> 26:46.021
It is to me.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.106
(electric guitar playing
slow rock melody)

26:50.233 --> 26:52.861
(guitar continues)

27:13.256 --> 27:15.675
(plays note on keyboard)

27:16.968 --> 27:20.013
(accompanying guitar)

27:22.974 --> 27:25.101
(guitar pauses)

27:25.185 --> 27:28.646
(guitar resumes,
keyboards pause)

27:30.899 --> 27:33.902
(both playing together)

27:46.498 --> 27:48.541
♪ ♪

27:58.843 --> 28:02.555
Before you say anything,
I just want to apologize.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.100
{\an3}Stop, stop, I have
to tell you something.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.560
{\an3}I think maybe you
should sit down

28:07.644 --> 28:09.521
{\an3}before I tell you
this, though.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.232
{\an1}If you're breaking up with me,
I think I'd rather stand.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.317
Have a seat.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.281
(sighs)

28:20.365 --> 28:22.951
Uh...

28:23.034 --> 28:25.120
I'm not Ted.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.956
{\an6}(laughs):
What is that
supposed to mean?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.958
It means I'm not the guy
that wrote you those letters.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.836
{\an1}I'm not the man
you fell in love with.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.797
My name is Steve Sanders.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.298
But you...

28:37.382 --> 28:39.801
you knew what was in them.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.637
Ted had an office
in the building where I work.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.472
{\an1}And when he
switched jobs,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.141
he asked one of my employees

28:46.224 --> 28:47.600
to forward his mail.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.477
Well, she must've got
the address wrong.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.646
because all the letters
kept coming back to us.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.649
And you read them?
No, not at first.

28:54.732 --> 28:57.735
But then... there were
these postcards, and...

28:58.862 --> 29:01.865
...they were beautiful, and...

29:01.948 --> 29:04.200
Yeah, I read them.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.994
But they were so intimate...

29:06.077 --> 29:08.121
(laughs):
so personal.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.623
How could you?

29:10.707 --> 29:13.042
I sent them back to you,
but you flew here before

29:13.126 --> 29:14.794
{\an4}they had a chance
to reach you.
Wait.

29:14.878 --> 29:18.381
{\an1}Wait. Just stop.
Jill, the thing is...

29:18.465 --> 29:21.259
{\an1}I'm thinking we really
have something here.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.847
Just get away from me.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.640
Jill, come on,
I know what I did wrong.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.602
Just get away from me!

29:35.231 --> 29:37.192
{\an5}NOAH:
<i>Yeah, Donna and I</i>
<i>have a meeting tomorrow</i>

29:37.275 --> 29:39.194
with your buyers at 10:00.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.987
That's what I'm proposing.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.989
Mayalee's takes
the samples on consignment,

29:43.072 --> 29:45.825
and I will handle
anything that doesn't move,

29:45.909 --> 29:47.577
including incidental costs.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.246
Yeah, but you got
to keep it between us.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.789
Even Donna.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.374
(knocking)

29:53.458 --> 29:55.793
{\an3}All right, I'll see
you tomorrow. Thanks.

29:55.877 --> 29:56.711
Hey.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.505
{\an1}Hey.
Sorry. Was I interrupting?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.715
No, it was an old friend.
What's up?

30:00.798 --> 30:01.799
Me. My mood.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.719
{\an1}I, um, just spent the day
thinking about what you said

30:04.802 --> 30:06.721
about not giving up
and being patient.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.056
And you were right.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.516
That's the spirit.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.226
{\an1}If we go in to Mayalee's
tomorrow thinking

30:11.309 --> 30:12.602
{\an1}they're gonna love us,
they will.

30:12.685 --> 30:13.770
Like money in the bank.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.813
Yeah.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.315
(giggles)

30:19.734 --> 30:21.694
(knocking)

30:21.778 --> 30:23.571
Coming.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.575
Hey, I've been calling you.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.785
Thank you.

30:28.868 --> 30:29.619
For what?

30:29.702 --> 30:32.247
I started playing again,
with Sloan.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.415
I mean, not really with...

30:34.499 --> 30:37.335
(laughs):
I-It's really hard to explain.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.712
But... you were right.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.756
Well, I'm happy for you,
and I want to hear all about it,

30:41.839 --> 30:43.883
{\an3}but I got to get
my mom off on her date.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.468
{\an6}Her date?
Yeah, she's
being mysterious

30:45.552 --> 30:47.595
about the whole thing,
but I'm not pressing.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.889
{\an3}Anybody who can take her
off my hands is fine by me.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.225
(light knocking)

30:55.061 --> 30:56.771
{\an3}Hey.
David, hi.

30:56.854 --> 30:59.941
You know, if you're here
to see Kelly, she's not here.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.609
I'm not here
to see Kelly.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.069
Well, then who
are you here to see?

31:03.152 --> 31:04.320
(footsteps approaching)

31:04.404 --> 31:05.238
Hi, Bill.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.322
{\an3}Hi.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.615
I-I'm sorry I'm late.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.866
Oh, that's all right.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.451
Wha... He's your date?

31:10.535 --> 31:11.786
{\an1}I know what
you're thinking.

31:11.869 --> 31:13.830
{\an3}Well, then how
can you do this?

31:13.913 --> 31:16.291
Because I believe he didn't
do anything to hurt you.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.335
{\an3}Like you've ever been a
good judge of that before.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.129
You know, now's probably
not a really good time.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.463
It'll be okay.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.798
{\an1}It's fine.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.592
We'll talk about this later.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.638
Evening.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.641
(sighs)

31:33.725 --> 31:36.102
{\an5}KYLE:
<i>But I don't understand--</i>
<i>she's a bigot.</i>

31:36.185 --> 31:37.687
She is the child's mother.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.480
{\an1}I'm sorry, but,
according to the law,

31:39.564 --> 31:41.482
that's all that matters.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.318
What are you doing here?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.862
{\an3}I know that Leanne read
the article, and...

31:45.945 --> 31:47.822
I just wanted to tell you

31:47.905 --> 31:49.949
{\an3}I think what she's
doing is wrong.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.493
Unbelievably enough,
no one else does.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.747
{\an1}GENE (sniffles):
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.707
Yes, it is.

31:57.790 --> 32:01.169
{\an6}(sniffling):
You're going back
to your mommy now.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.173
{\an3}Can't you guys
fight this?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.842
{\an1}We could cry
discrimination,

32:07.925 --> 32:11.346
{\an1}drag it out for a year
or two in court.

32:11.429 --> 32:14.182
Think of how hard it would be
to give him up then.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.393
{\an6}Ah, you think about
how hard it would be for
Raphael to give <i> us</i> up.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.315
That's why
we'd never do it.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.776
(whispers inaudibly)

32:34.619 --> 32:36.829
(trembling sigh)

32:38.915 --> 32:40.291
I'm sorry.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.444
{\an1}Can you promise us
that that girl will be

33:08.528 --> 33:11.155
as good a parent
as the two of us would've been?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.782
Can you do that?

33:32.009 --> 33:34.637
{\an5}BRANDON:
<i>If you don't want to go</i>
<i>to this thing today,</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:35.805
I completely understand.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.765
{\an3}And miss seeing you
get an award? No.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.267
{\an1}Here, let me do that.
Thanks.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.353
{\an4}Did you write your
acceptance speech yet?
Yeah.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.981
{\an3}I'm sorry. Did you say
you were looking for a job?

33:45.064 --> 33:48.276
I'll be in the car.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.569
(sighs) This is so weird.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.612
{\an1}Even if I win,
I feel like I'm losing.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.823
I know how you feel.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.116
How do you know?

33:55.199 --> 33:56.284
You backed Leanne, she won.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.410
I don't see your loss.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.953
She abandoned him.

33:59.036 --> 34:02.290
{\an3}Gene and Kyle loved him
enough to let him go.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.292
When they asked me if I thought

34:04.375 --> 34:06.377
that she would make
a better mother than them,

34:06.461 --> 34:07.378
there's no way.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.338
And what's hurting

34:09.422 --> 34:13.384
is knowing that I wouldn't
have been better either.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.635
Don't be so hard on yourself.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.304
I've been thinking
about it, Brandon.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.639
And the reason that I had
such a bad reaction

34:19.724 --> 34:25.188
to Gene and Kyle was because
I wanted the baby for myself.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.482
It had nothing to do
with the baby

34:27.565 --> 34:29.400
or his needs--
it was all about me.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.862
Oh, there she is.

34:32.945 --> 34:33.862
Hi, Dad.

34:33.946 --> 34:34.947
{\an3}Hi, honey.
Hi, Brandon.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.491
Bill, Abby!

34:36.574 --> 34:37.492
Hi.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.327
{\an3}Why are you guys
holding hands?

34:39.409 --> 34:41.120
Didn't Valerie tell you?

34:41.204 --> 34:43.371
{\an3}VALERIE:
The wonderful news?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.041
I thought I'd let you tell her.

34:45.123 --> 34:47.502
{\an3}We're pretty happy
about this.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.879
We just hope
you are, too.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.380
Happy about what?
I didn't even know

34:51.464 --> 34:52.757
{\an3}that you two knew
each other.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.342
Valerie introduced us.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.469
Guilty as charged.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.397
Are you sure?

35:08.481 --> 35:09.690
{\an3}Donna...

35:09.774 --> 35:10.858
You're not just saying it?

35:10.942 --> 35:11.818
You made the sale.

35:11.901 --> 35:12.819
I did? I did?!

35:12.902 --> 35:14.904
The dresses are terrific.

35:14.987 --> 35:17.990
I'll expect 20 to be ready
for display sometime next week.

35:18.074 --> 35:21.035
{\an6}Twenty?
We'll have 'em
for you. Thank you.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.537
(phone rings)
Excuse me.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.249
{\an3}Hello?

35:26.332 --> 35:29.210
{\an3}Okay.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.545
I have to step out.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.672
Take your time gathering
your things.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.883
Hmm...

35:35.967 --> 35:38.219
{\an1}Did she just say
what I think she said?

35:38.302 --> 35:39.053
{\an3}That you're
a brilliant designer

35:39.136 --> 35:41.055
{\an1}and she's happy to have you?
She said it.

35:41.138 --> 35:43.599
Oh, yay! (laughs)

35:44.684 --> 35:47.395
(baby crying inside house)

35:52.275 --> 35:53.442
Hi.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.112
What are you doing here?

35:56.195 --> 35:59.073
I just came by to see how
you were doing with Raphael.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.075
Erik's fine.

36:01.158 --> 36:03.411
Is he?

36:03.494 --> 36:06.414
{\an1}Babies cry,
in case you haven't heard.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.416
I don't remember you working
for the child welfare people.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.544
{\an3}Yesterday you asked me
a question,

36:11.627 --> 36:15.089
{\an3}and I wasn't sure how
to answer it, but now I am.

36:15.172 --> 36:16.048
If I were you,

36:16.132 --> 36:18.509
I would let Kyle and Gene
raise my baby.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.639
I'm busy.
So if you don't mind...

36:23.723 --> 36:25.433
{\an3}Leanne,

36:25.516 --> 36:29.103
parenting isn't about biology
or sexuality.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.438
It's about love.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.152
Leanne, you've just got

36:36.235 --> 36:37.987
to start taking some
responsibility for this baby.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.290
(voice breaking):
I love my baby.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.877
Do you? Do you really?

37:07.558 --> 37:09.268
You guys, I think we're up next.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.353
Ladies and gentleman,

37:10.436 --> 37:13.481
our next category is
for best investigative report.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.775
You know you could at least
pretend to like each other.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.945
Dennis Kress,
The <i> L.A. Gazette,</i>

37:19.028 --> 37:20.988
"The Metro Rail,
The Gravy Train of the '90s."

37:21.072 --> 37:22.073
So how's Jill?

37:22.156 --> 37:24.492
She never wants to see me again.
Thanks for asking.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.160
"Life on the Streets,"
Brandon Walsh,<i> The Beverly Beat.</i>

37:26.243 --> 37:27.161
Any word from Kelly?

37:27.244 --> 37:28.496
{\an3}No word.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.206
And the winner is...

37:31.457 --> 37:33.417
Jennifer Ruiz.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.054
Wow,

37:45.137 --> 37:47.515
{\an1}thank you.
Thank you all.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.475
What did I miss?

37:49.558 --> 37:52.520
{\an3}Oh, a lot of good
conversation,

37:52.603 --> 37:54.355
{\an3}good humor,
lots of laughs.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.982
You know, a real joy.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.024
Oh, that bad.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.026
{\an1}We lost.
How'd it go with Leanne?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.820
Like talking to a wall.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.698
Probably a lot like it's been
talking to me the past few days.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.242
{\an1}..and publisher,
Nikki Coulter.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.451
Thank you.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.208
Finally, ladies and gentleman,

38:14.291 --> 38:16.335
we'd like to present
a Governor's award today

38:16.419 --> 38:17.253
for special achievement.

38:17.336 --> 38:19.880
To introduce the recipient
of the award,

38:19.964 --> 38:22.758
{\an1}here's the publisher of the
<i>Beverly Beat,</i> Steve Sanders.

38:35.229 --> 38:36.731
Thank you.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.233
When I first heard
the Association was gonna

38:39.317 --> 38:42.862
honor Brandon Walsh with this
award, I was thrilled.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.697
I prepared this long speech
about how I couldn't imagine

38:44.780 --> 38:46.782
anyone more deserving,

38:46.866 --> 38:50.244
but I'm not gonna read from it
because I'm angry.

38:50.327 --> 38:54.415
I'm angry that this guy
doesn't know how good he is,

38:54.498 --> 38:56.625
how much his stories affect
the lives of others

38:56.709 --> 38:59.086
and what a difference
he really makes.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.757
I tried explaining it to him,
but he won't listen.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.509
Maybe he'll listen to you.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.438
{\an3}I hate you,
you know that?

39:17.521 --> 39:19.523
{\an1}The ends justifies
the means here, baby.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.358
And then some.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.820
Thank you, Steve.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.281
Um, you publish
a pretty good rag.

39:27.364 --> 39:30.826
And if I have anything
to say about it,

39:30.910 --> 39:33.788
you'll be publishing it
for some time to come.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.915
{\an1}Oh, yeah!

39:48.886 --> 39:49.804
{\an1}Hey, man.

39:49.887 --> 39:50.763
{\an3}Hey.

39:50.846 --> 39:53.015
{\an1}Thought you might like
to hear how this sounds.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.476
I hope you didn't mind me
joining in with you.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.977
{\an1}Mind?
I'm obliged, man.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.688
{\an1}This is the first song
I've finished in five years.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.816
Why? What happened to you?

40:01.899 --> 40:03.317
What happened to <i> you?</i>

40:03.400 --> 40:04.402
After "Keep It Together,"

40:04.485 --> 40:06.737
I would've thought
you'd have been way past here.

40:06.821 --> 40:11.200
Things just didn't work out.

40:11.283 --> 40:12.910
They rarely do.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.673
It's a good song, man.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.341
What are you gonna
do with this?

40:27.424 --> 40:28.676
{\an1}The same thing
you should,

40:28.759 --> 40:30.010
just enjoy it.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.329
David, listen to me.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.373
{\an5}My mom and Bill
are going away
for the weekend.

40:59.456 --> 41:00.416
Can you believe this?

41:00.499 --> 41:02.209
Come here.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.878
{\an1}What?
Come here. Trust me.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.087
What am I gonna do?

41:05.171 --> 41:09.383
Just relax for
a second, okay.

41:09.466 --> 41:10.551
{\an3}Come on.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.969
(groans)

41:12.052 --> 41:14.555
Hmm?
Yeah.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.556
{\an3}How's that?

41:15.639 --> 41:16.557
Nice.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.350
Nice?
Yeah.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.019
(both chuckle)

41:25.024 --> 41:26.734
{\an3}I don't want to see
you any more.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.235
{\an1}Wait.
Do we have something or not?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.570
I have something with Ted.

41:29.653 --> 41:30.905
I don't know you.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.240
{\an4}Oh, you know,
the crazy thing is,
I think you do.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.950
{\an1}It's like we were meant
to be together.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.660
{\an3}I was meant to be
with Ted. Taxi!

41:36.744 --> 41:38.287
{\an3}But your letters
came to me.

41:38.370 --> 41:39.747
If you cared about me,

41:39.830 --> 41:41.290
{\an1}you'd figure out why
that happened,

41:41.373 --> 41:43.417
and you'd fix it.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.460
{\an3}I tried.

41:44.543 --> 41:46.795
It's like the universe
is keeping us together!

41:46.879 --> 41:48.756
The universe? Uh-huh.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.300
{\an3}Jill, wait.

41:51.383 --> 41:53.761
You know the saying, "If you
love something, let it go"?

41:53.844 --> 41:56.096
Yeah. It's something
Ted used to write to me.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.807
Oh, good, 'cause that's gonna
make it very easy for me.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.434
Make what easy?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.561
I'm gonna find Ted.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.772
{\an1}You are not making
any sense.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.774
{\an3}If finding Ted is
gonna make you happy,

42:06.857 --> 42:09.151
then finding Ted is
what I'm gonna do.

42:09.235 --> 42:12.321
Because after all this,
I want to see you happy.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.909
Good-bye... whoever you are.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.500
(knocking)

42:26.585 --> 42:28.420
{\an1}It's a miracle,
that's what it is.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.463
{\an1}It's nothing
but a miracle.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.299
{\an1}The mother changed
her mind.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.426
We got a phone call from
Pam about two hours ago

42:34.510 --> 42:36.303
{\an3}asking if we'd be willing
to take in a baby.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.264
{\an3}We said yes without
even knowing

42:38.347 --> 42:39.765
that it was Raphael.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.810
We just wanted you
to share our joy.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.436
I'm really happy for you guys.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.815
{\an1}So am I.

42:47.898 --> 42:49.984
You mean that?

42:50.067 --> 42:51.902
Yeah, I do.

42:51.986 --> 42:55.531
(baby fussing)

42:56.699 --> 42:59.159
{\an4}It's dinnertime.
We'd better go.
Yeah.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.541
Say bye-bye.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.128
Bye, baby.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.425
I'm going home now.

43:15.676 --> 43:19.054
I'm finally going home.

43:30.482 --> 43:33.360
{\an1}You did
a good thing there.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.071
Yeah, I did.

43:37.406 --> 43:40.451
{\an1}No, you did
an incredibly good thing.
