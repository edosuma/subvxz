00:03.103 --> 00:06.664
Hey, hey. Look.
Y'all will never guess what I got here.

00:11.611 --> 00:15.672
All right, all right. Don't tell me. A rabbit.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.307
Yeah.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.679
I'm really good at this. Ha-ha.

00:22.055 --> 00:25.081
- This is Nicky's Easter present.
- Oh, he'll love it.

00:25.258 --> 00:30.457
Aww. Oh, look at the little lumpy bumpy
bunny wunny.

00:31.564 --> 00:35.398
This little guy brings back memories.
He reminds me of my rabbit, Snowball.

00:35.568 --> 00:36.899
What? You had a rabbit?

00:37.070 --> 00:40.904
Oh, yeah. I'll never forget how upset I was
the day Snowball disappeared.

00:41.074 --> 00:44.009
But I was okay once Dad explained
Snowball's mommy and daddy...

00:44.177 --> 00:47.977
...had to take her back to their hutch
because they were so Ionely without her.

00:49.649 --> 00:52.345
I remember. That was the Easter
Grandma Hattie came over...

00:52.519 --> 00:54.510
...and made that secret stew.
What was that?

00:54.687 --> 00:56.678
I don't know. I don't remember.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.915
Of course, you do.

00:59.092 --> 01:02.118
- It tasted like chicken but it wasn't.
- Hilary.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.753
Oh, my God. I remember that stew.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.490
It was delicious.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.636
Geoffrey, you gotta make that stew.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.965
Don't tempt me.

<i>Tell old pharaoh</i>

02:35.755 --> 02:42.024
<i>Let my people go</i>

02:48.201 --> 02:50.897
<i>Tell old pharaoh</i>

02:51.070 --> 02:56.440
<i>Let my cousin grow</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:05.374
Carlton, give it up. Reverend Sims
is gonna give me the Easter solo, not you.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.917
Ha-ha. Oh, well.

03:09.088 --> 03:12.114
- I'm gonna put my golf clubs away, okay?
- Alrighty.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.692
Hello, Reverend Sims.
Did you have a good golf game?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.421
- Well...
- And that is a lovely golf shirt.

03:17.597 --> 03:18.962
Why, thank you, Ashley.

03:19.399 --> 03:23.199
Would you look at that?
Shameful sucking up.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.533
Oh, Carlton, hey. I really wanna thank you
for that lovely sweater you sent me.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.767
But you know that Choirmaster Hawkins
makes the final decision...

03:30.944 --> 03:32.673
...on who sings that Easter solo.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.204
Oh.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.348
I knew that.

03:36.683 --> 03:40.346
Great, now I'm gonna
have to buy another sweater.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.546
- What's going on?
- All right, Will.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.623
- Well, I'm gonna go upstairs and practice.
- All right.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.455
So, Will,
I haven't seen you at the church lately.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.461
Oh, I be in the back.

03:54.467 --> 03:55.934
Hey, Aunt Viv.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.535
- Vivian.
- Gordon, how are you?

03:57.704 --> 04:00.673
I'm so glad you stopped in.
I baked you a sweet potato pie.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.864
What's the occasion?

04:02.041 --> 04:05.533
Thanking you for getting the children
so involved in Church activities.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.772
Bringing the families back to Church
is always a priority of mine.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.679
And since Margaret passed,
it really helps to fill the void.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.619
Maybe you could help me with Will.

04:15.788 --> 04:19.416
Yes, Will, sure would be nice
to see you down at the church.

04:19.591 --> 04:23.756
Oh. Yeah, Rev, you know, Sunday's kind of
a bad day for me, you know...

04:23.930 --> 04:26.626
...what with Saturday usually being
a late-night night...

04:26.799 --> 04:28.460
...you know what I'm talking about?

04:28.635 --> 04:32.366
But I tell you what, y'all get something
kicked off on a Tuesday, I'm there.

04:32.872 --> 04:36.672
As a matter of fact, your aunt is coming by
to finish up work on the fundraiser...

04:36.843 --> 04:39.209
...for the new youth center tomorrow.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.610
So why don't you come on by
and help decorate the church for Easter?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.713
Shoo. Tomorrow, gosh. Man.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.945
You know, any other day but tomorrow
I could've done it, you know.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.285
Even yesterday. Even yesterday. But...
Pbbt.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.359
Well, that's really too bad.
You know, the ladies would love...

04:55.528 --> 04:58.224
...having a strong young man around there
to help them out.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.423
- Ladies?
- Ladies.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.798
- There's gonna be some honeys up in there?
- I can guarantee at least a couple honeys.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.768
Heh. I'll see you tomorrow.

05:06.939 --> 05:11.205
Come on down there and I get myself
a little sticky, you know what I'm talking...

05:11.377 --> 05:13.641
You know. You know what I'm saying.

05:13.813 --> 05:18.273
You know, because honey is sticky.
You know.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.759
Ladies, here I go,
let the decorating begin.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.824
Oh, this nice young man
has come here to help us.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.793
My, what a handsome devil.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.299
And I feel kind of devilish.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.631
Whoo! Oh! Oh.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.535
Oh, man. Oh, I got a page.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.370
Oh, it's 911. Tupac just got arrested again.
I need to go.

05:44.544 --> 05:45.943
I didn't hear any pager.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.242
Oh, um... Well, this is the kind that vibrates.

05:49.415 --> 05:53.249
I didn't see your hip vibrating.
Wish I had though.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.623
So, Will, how are things going
with the decorating committee?

06:02.795 --> 06:07.732
Not too bad. Except for all them old ladies
down there pinching my cheeks.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.896
Well, Will, that's the way old ladies are.

06:11.070 --> 06:15.166
They see a young man with a cute face,
they love to pinch his cheeks.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.275
I ain't talking about my face.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.641
I love Harry. I'm gonna keep him forever.

06:23.816 --> 06:27.343
<i>Yeah, unless Grandma Hattie
pulls another Fatal Attraction.</i>

06:28.454 --> 06:29.819
Will.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.389
I'm gonna keep him happy and healthy.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.186
Well, if that's the case, man,
you gotta work him out.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.886
I mean, even rabbits need exercise.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.465
You gotta teach him, like,
some aerabbits.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.563
<i>Rock, rock the rabbit, rock</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:45.761
<i>Don't stop</i>

06:52.545 --> 06:55.605
There are certain responsibilities
that go along with having a pet.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.751
You have to feed him, wash him,
clean up his mess.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.682
Just don't expect a thank you.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.287
Hey.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.628
Hey, stop playing, Verna.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.496
Ain't nobody that nearsighted.

07:18.871 --> 07:23.433
Hey. How y'all doing? Hey, let me tell you,
your cookies are really, really good.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.602
He's only saying that.
The only ones he really like are mine.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.907
Your cookies suck.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.744
Well, suck this.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.355
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop, stop it.
Stop. Rose. Would y'all stop?

07:36.522 --> 07:38.956
Rose, stop it. Stop it.
I ain't playing. Rose.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.492
I ain't playing, all right? I ain't playing.
Now stop it. Come on, y'all.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.187
We got a lot of work to do here.

07:45.364 --> 07:47.924
Who wants to hold the ladder
while I put up this banner?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.761
- I'm gonna do it.
- No. I wanna do it.

07:49.936 --> 07:53.531
Hey, listen,
you both can hold the ladder for me.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.711
Will, you're doing a great job.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.609
We really appreciate it.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.444
You know, it does feel good
to give something back to the communit...

08:07.253 --> 08:09.016
Hey.

08:09.522 --> 08:13.891
<i>was blind</i>

08:14.060 --> 08:19.623
<i>But now</i>

08:19.799 --> 08:26.796
<i>I see</i>

08:31.844 --> 08:33.778
Thank you.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.178
Ashley, that was very good.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.115
Thanks.

08:44.023 --> 08:48.392
Nice try. Now watch how it's done.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.899
Make a note. Unruly.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.873
<i>Michael, row your boat ashore</i>

09:04.343 --> 09:09.178
<i>Hallelujah</i>

09:09.348 --> 09:13.751
<i>Michael, row your boat ashore</i>

09:13.920 --> 09:18.516
<i>Hallelujah</i>

09:19.592 --> 09:21.355
Hit it.

09:25.565 --> 09:31.595
<i>Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah</i>

09:31.771 --> 09:37.971
<i>Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah</i>

09:38.144 --> 09:41.307
<i>The river is deep, the river is wide</i>

09:41.480 --> 09:44.381
<i>Hallelujah</i>

09:44.550 --> 09:47.781
<i>Milk and honey on the other side</i>

09:47.954 --> 09:50.980
<i>Hallelu-lu-lu-lu-lu-jah</i>

09:51.157 --> 09:54.058
Michael, row. Row that boat ashore.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.222
Gordon, can you believe
we're almost done?

09:58.397 --> 10:01.025
You have done such a wonderful job
for the children.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.964
No, no. We have done a wonderful job.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.472
Vivian,
I would have been lost without you.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.406
Well, it's easy to get people to donate
when it's for a man of your reputation.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.009
You know, I haven't enjoyed working so
closely with someone in a long, long time.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.640
I've loved working with you too.
It's a shame it's all over.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.384
It doesn't have to be.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.852
What?

10:24.023 --> 10:26.753
Vivian, I've always been in love with you.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.712
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, honey.

10:48.881 --> 10:52.282
- You okay?
- Sure, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be okay?

10:52.451 --> 10:56.148
Well, first of all, because you seasoning
the chicken with cleanser.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.450
Look, I saw what happened
down at the church.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.887
Will, I don't know what to do.

11:06.065 --> 11:09.865
I don't know whether to tell Philip or not.
If I tell him, he's gonna be furious.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.901
This whole thing doesn't make any sense.

11:13.272 --> 11:17.368
Makes sense to me. Look like the Rev's
trying to get his hallelujah on.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.804
Honey, he's an old friend of the family's,
and he's close with your uncle.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.382
My God, why did he have to do this?

11:27.053 --> 11:29.317
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

11:29.488 --> 11:31.683
Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?

11:31.857 --> 11:36.317
Oh, man, what's going on, boy?
Shoot. Hey.

11:36.495 --> 11:40.522
I was asking you what's going on because
there ain't nothing going on in here.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.964
There's nothing going...
I wanted to know with you.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.502
Did you have something going on?
Because we don't have any.

11:48.974 --> 11:53.035
Oh... Vivian, could you have Geoffrey
put out an extra plate tonight?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.373
I've invited Reverend Sims for dinner.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.606
You can't.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.582
Uh... Ain't enough chicken.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.647
I mean, there's too much chicken.
You know what they say about ministers.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.057
You know, they will eat and eat
and eat until they die.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.493
Yeah. They're like goldfish.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.131
You are a very odd young man.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.735
One, two, one, two.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.543
Come on, Harry, give me another one.

12:25.711 --> 12:29.408
<i>Be all that you can be</i>

12:29.648 --> 12:33.607
I'm gonna get you some lettuce, Harry.
You stay right here.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.099
Uh...

13:22.334 --> 13:24.029
Harry, I'm coming.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.868
Oh.

13:28.774 --> 13:29.934
Where's Harry?

13:30.109 --> 13:33.135
Uh... He went upstairs,
boom, two steps at a time.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.405
I guess he was really hungry.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.981
- Where's his box?
- He took it with him.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.052
Because he knew it didn't belong
down here, he put it away.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.523
But if he was hungry,
why didn't he just come in the kitchen?

13:45.691 --> 13:47.955
Nicky, he's just a rabbit.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.896
Harry. Come here, boy. Come here, Harry.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.924
I need you to go to a pet shop,
find a rabbit that looks just like Harry.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.128
- But I don't have the time, Daddy.
- Please.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.537
I don't feel like it.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.243
And get yourself some shoes.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.909
Bye, Daddy.

14:13.819 --> 14:17.778
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Oh, Will, something terrible has happened.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.415
- I know.
- I didn't mean to kill him.

14:22.027 --> 14:26.020
What? What? Uncle Phil, you killed him?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.666
- Oh, my God. Does anybody know?
- Hilary may suspect.

14:28.834 --> 14:32.395
She came in right after it happened.
I mean, it was an accident.

14:32.571 --> 14:35.699
Okay, good. Good.
You said that like you really believed it.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.274
It was an accident, Will.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.503
Hey, hey, man,
I'm not the one you gotta convince.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.544
Nicky is gonna be very upset.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.115
What? I think Nicky
is the least of your worries.

14:45.284 --> 14:48.276
Okay. All right. All right.
Uncle Phil, go upstairs, pack a bag.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.922
I'm gonna get the car.
We gonna shoot down to Tijuana.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.752
We gonna chill in Mexico,
this whole thing blows over.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.986
Will, they don't arrest you
for sitting on a rabbit.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.799
- You killed Harry.
- Yeah.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.163
You killed Harry.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.862
Ah! That's great, man. You killed Harry. Oh.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.932
Will, who did you think I killed?

15:12.111 --> 15:15.308
I thought you killed Harry.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.544
- Nicky.
- Nicky.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.744
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.956
I still can't find Harry.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.025
Oh, he'll show up.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.251
Hey, hey.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.093
- Did you get the rabbit?
- Yeah, but, l...

15:32.264 --> 15:37.031
Nicky, good news. Hilary found Harry.
Heh-heh.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.607
It was all they had.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.748
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Oh, thank you, Uncle Phil.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.489
Gordon,
you are gonna love Vivian's chicken.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.423
Heh-heh.
Would you prefer a breast or thigh?

16:03.595 --> 16:06.564
Uh! He'll take a wing.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.562
Reverend, by any chance, did you happen
to speak to the choirmaster today?

16:11.737 --> 16:16.504
From what I understand, there's some very,
very stiff competition for the solo this year.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.666
Well, would he ever ask you
for your advice?

16:18.844 --> 16:20.471
Well, that's a possibility.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.070
Would you mind...

16:22.247 --> 16:28.516
<i>... passing the peas, please?</i>

16:30.789 --> 16:35.123
<i>Could you pass the pork...</i>

16:35.294 --> 16:36.522
...dork?

16:38.797 --> 16:42.062
So how are things down at the church?

16:42.234 --> 16:45.260
- Fine.
- Yes, fine.

16:46.772 --> 16:52.540
<i>I could use another boiled potato, please...</i>

16:54.747 --> 16:59.343
<i>Thank you</i>

17:00.586 --> 17:03.350
Would you excuse me for a minute,
please?

17:05.491 --> 17:08.517
I can't wait to hear
this year's Easter sermon.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.594
Last year's was very inspiring.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.258
Yeah, you might wanna cover
all the commandments this year.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.372
Vivian, I need to talk to you.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.635
- Why don't you go in and finish your dinner?
- Vivian, I am sorry about what happened.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.938
- It was a mistake.
- It certainly was.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.879
Look, I haven't spent much time
with a woman since Margaret passed.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.578
I guess I got confused, I lost my way.

17:35.754 --> 17:40.487
- I realize there is no excuse for it, but...
- You're right, there is no excuse.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.958
Gordon,
this is really making me uncomfortable.

17:47.666 --> 17:51.295
Well, maybe it's best if I just leave.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.433
I think that's a good idea.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.208
Where's Gordon going?

18:04.383 --> 18:07.443
Oh, an emergency came up.
He told me to say goodbye to everybody.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.883
Let's go have a nice dinner.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.047
Are you all right?

18:12.524 --> 18:14.958
Yes, honey, I'm all right now.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.624
Daddy, you know how you told me
that Harry's black now...

18:20.799 --> 18:24.360
...because rabbits change colors
for Easter?

18:24.570 --> 18:27.835
Isn't there a little more to that story?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.635
Well, yes. Uh...

18:32.644 --> 18:36.341
<i>Nicky, you remember in The Lion King
when Mufasa...?</i>

18:36.515 --> 18:39.348
Daddy, did you sit on Harry?

18:40.986 --> 18:44.012
- Yes. But... But...
- That's okay, Dad.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.191
Death is a natural part of life.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.785
But what a way to go.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.859
And as it says in Matthew:

18:59.037 --> 19:03.133
"If a man has 100 sheep and one strays...

19:03.542 --> 19:08.878
...does he not leave the 99 on the mountain
to search for the stray one?"

19:09.047 --> 19:10.071
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, yes.

19:10.249 --> 19:15.118
"And if he finds it,
he is happy over finding that one...

19:15.287 --> 19:17.983
...than over the 99 that did not stray."

19:18.157 --> 19:19.784
Glory.
- Tell the truth now, pastor.

19:19.958 --> 19:23.689
Well, you see,
the truth is I am one of the flock.

19:23.862 --> 19:29.926
And every now and then I too must ask
for forgiveness, as we all do.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.228
Oh, yes.
- That's right.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.668
And I can only pray that the Lord...

19:35.874 --> 19:38.434
...and those I have offended...

19:38.644 --> 19:39.668
...will forgive me.

19:39.845 --> 19:40.971
Okay, now.
Amen.

19:41.146 --> 19:44.013
"For if you forgive men
for their transgressions...

19:44.550 --> 19:48.008
...your Heavenly Father
will also forgive you."

19:48.187 --> 19:50.348
Amen.
That's right.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.547
Amen.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.249
Amen.

19:55.427 --> 19:59.261
Now I am proud to present
this year's Easter hymn.

19:59.431 --> 20:03.367
Now, traditionally, the Easter hymn
is a showcase for one voice.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.766
However, this year,
I'm proud to announce that we have a duo.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.065
- Oh, yes.
Yes, we do.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.903
I want you all to please help me welcome
Ashley and Carlton Banks.

20:12.077 --> 20:15.376
- Yes, hallelujah.
- Yes. Praise the Lord.

20:20.185 --> 20:23.245
<i>This little light of mine</i>

20:23.422 --> 20:26.755
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

20:26.925 --> 20:29.723
<i>- This little light of mine

20:29.895 --> 20:32.989

<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

20:45.944 --> 20:49.402

21:04.129 --> 21:10.762

21:11.403 --> 21:14.463

21:14.640 --> 21:17.632

21:40.198 --> 21:43.361

Oh</i>

<i>This little light of mine</i>

21:46.538 --> 21:49.769

21:49.941 --> 21:52.535

21:52.978 --> 21:55.173

21:55.347 --> 22:00.979
