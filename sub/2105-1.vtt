<i>Ying xiong,
but you just missed it.</i>

03:10.760 --> 03:13.260
<i>Wu Ying Xiong, report to the Substation.</i>

03:45.875 --> 03:47.275
Air support!

03:55.614 --> 03:57.614
You do have the code, don't you?

04:01.539 --> 04:03.539
Why? It's a helicopter again!

04:46.704 --> 04:49.204
Don't worry. I'm a cop.

04:49.429 --> 04:52.229
I'm Chen Zhen from the Eastern Substation.

04:57.754 --> 04:59.954
Hey, I know you.
You're Wu Yung xiong.

04:59.979 --> 05:01.979
All the police in Harbor City know you.

05:02.004 --> 05:04.004
Let me take a photo of you, Come on./
Hei.

05:04.029 --> 05:06.029
Smile, / Hei.

05:06.854 --> 05:09.254
Come on./
Hei.

05:09.879 --> 05:11.879
Here, let's take another one.

05:15.804 --> 05:20.704
You saved 320 passengers
and stopped the hijacking terrorists.

05:20.729 --> 05:24.849
The press describes you as the star police officers.
You've won the Kick Boxing Championship three times

05:24.854 --> 05:26.854
and the second place in the
Shooting Tournament twice.

05:26.879 --> 05:29.379
But you let Xu Da fu go,
one of the most wanted criminals,

05:29.704 --> 05:31.704
- right?
- And?

05:32.729 --> 05:34.729
What do you want?

05:34.854 --> 05:37.854
Nothing.
I"m also investigating this case.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.379
Was passing by here
and saw you hanging there.

05:42.704 --> 05:46.404
I know you're embarrassed,
I will try my best to keep my mouth shut.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.709
But this is my case.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.234
Oh, is it?

05:55.859 --> 05:59.259
The photo can prove our friendship, right?

06:13.784 --> 06:15.784
Brother Hulk?
Contact Officer Lan the Forensics,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.409
Ask her to collect the evidance from
the scene scene on Highway 3.

06:28.604 --> 06:30.604
In front of the real justice,

06:30.829 --> 06:32.029
We all are sinners.

06:32.054 --> 06:35.454
You and I are "us"

06:35.879 --> 06:38.679
We
Should've died...,

06:38.704 --> 06:40.404
long ago.

06:40.829 --> 06:43.329
But we've been escaping from the judgment.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.754
It's a ritual to clear our sins.

06:46.779 --> 06:49.279
Is it a joke?

06:49.804 --> 06:51.804
Mayor..,

06:51.829 --> 06:54.629
Those people,
are all wanted criminals on the loose.

06:54.654 --> 06:57.754
Those hypocrites... for their souls.

06:57.779 --> 07:00.379
It's a ritual to clear our sins.

07:02.604 --> 07:04.804
The number you've dialed is not available,

07:04.829 --> 07:07.329
Please begin at the sound of beep.

07:07.554 --> 07:09.854
I have an urgent case,
and have got to get back to the city now.

07:09.879 --> 07:11.879
I'll call you later.

07:13.704 --> 07:17.204
Anyway,
I have to meet you today.

07:19.809 --> 07:23.309
And,
please don't suddenly disappear again.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.434
Let's keep in touch.

07:34.609 --> 07:39.309
All passengers,
We're arriving HSR Harbor City Station.

07:40.704 --> 07:43.204
Out of my way! Move!

07:43.729 --> 07:46.490
What are you doing? Please calm down.
It;s the driver's cab, No entry.

07:47.754 --> 07:49.754
We're almost there,

07:50.809 --> 07:52.409
Almost there.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.734
Let me through! Let me through!

07:55.759 --> 07:58.559
It's gonna explode! Let me through!
Let me through!

07:58.784 --> 08:01.484
Let me through! The time's up!

08:35.609 --> 08:36.909
Execuse me, Mayor?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.634
Hello?

08:40.708 --> 08:42.708
Open the curtain!

08:42.734 --> 08:44.734
Open all the curtains!

08:51.809 --> 08:54.909
All the sacrifices
are worth celebrated,

08:54.934 --> 09:00.234
Let's create a wonderful future together.
Welcome to the new Harbor City.

09:24.409 --> 09:27.309
Help! Help!

09:34.404 --> 09:36.704
Help!
Somebody Help!

09:36.729 --> 09:38.929
I see you!

09:39.704 --> 09:42.304
Can you hear me?

09:52.409 --> 09:55.309
- Help!
- Don't be afraid, I'm here.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.704
Hang on!

10:27.809 --> 10:30.309
Take my hand.
Just take my hand!

10:32.734 --> 10:38.034
I got you!

10:46.709 --> 10:48.709
Is everything ok down there?

10:48.734 --> 10:50.734
The ambulance will be here in a minute.

11:13.759 --> 11:16.359
Are you looking at my car?
Want me to drive you?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.804
Why should I do that?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.800
Headlights or tires?

11:29.805 --> 11:32.705
No, neither.
Do I have other choices?

11:32.730 --> 11:34.730
Give me the keys,

11:39.005 --> 11:41.305
Rogue!
Bully!

11:41.730 --> 11:43.730
I knew it!

11:53.805 --> 11:56.705
What are you looking at?
Drive carefully.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.730
Don't mess up my home.

12:08.755 --> 12:12.055
Send all our force
out to every main road.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.680
And get me the profiles of
all those know how to make the explosives

12:15.705 --> 12:17.705
with or without criminal records.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.730
Yes, sir.
I have the profiles of the prime suspects,

12:19.755 --> 12:21.855
I'll circle them out.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.780
Harbor City HSR Station, Xu Zheng.
Cross-sea Bridge, Ma Tian xiang.

12:24.805 --> 12:26.805
East Main Bridge, Chen Fu lai.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.230
Central Station, Shao Shi chang.
Harbor Wharf, Gao Shang jie.

12:32.955 --> 12:34.955
Xu Da fu..,

12:35.180 --> 12:39.580
<i>all the explosives are on the disguised patrol cars or ambulances,
and all the explosions occurred in the transportation systems.</i>

12:39.805 --> 12:41.905
<i>Now the only ways out of
Harbor City are Na-an Iron Bridge</i>

12:41.930 --> 12:43.930
<i>and the Central Tunnel near you.</i>

12:43.955 --> 12:46.755
<i>Be careful when you're there</i>.
We've been informed

12:46.780 --> 12:50.280
that all the bombers
are the most wanted criminals,

12:51.005 --> 12:54.305
Brother Ying xiong,
the next one will be Xu Da fu.

12:56.730 --> 13:00.030
I think you said that
Xu Da fu fell into sea and died

13:00.055 --> 13:03.455
before the airplane was crash-landed.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.780
So We'll see

13:06.805 --> 13:10.305
the ghost of Xu Da fu later,
right?

13:11.630 --> 13:14.730
All units, beware of the unknow patrol cars
and ambulances around you,

13:14.755 --> 13:17.355
Stop it and search you see one.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.700
- <i> Brother Hulk</i>
- Xi ying. Wait,

13:39.725 --> 13:41.725
I'm talking to Ying xiong over the phone,

13:41.750 --> 13:42.950
Let me get you in.

13:42.975 --> 13:45.375
Brother Hulk
Can you tell me what it is?

13:47.746 --> 13:49.746
It's a signal source.

13:49.771 --> 13:51.871
Xi ying, Can you connect the signal source
to the mickey adapter,

13:51.896 --> 13:53.996
and using your phone
to send back the digital frequency to me?

13:54.021 --> 13:55.821
Give me a minute.

13:55.846 --> 13:58.746
<i>All units, Nan-an Iron Bridge,
were under unknown attack.</i>

13:58.771 --> 14:02.371
<i>All manpower execute immediate
support to the tunnel side.</i>

14:17.906 --> 14:21.306
Police!
Pull over the car!

14:25.631 --> 14:29.231
Xu Da fu!
It's him!

14:29.556 --> 14:31.756
You stupid cop!
How do you know I'm here?

14:31.781 --> 14:34.681
Pull over and get out immediately!
Stop now!

14:34.706 --> 14:36.806
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I can't stop

14:36.831 --> 14:40.231
or they'll kill Xio qing
and I'll be dead too.

14:43.656 --> 14:46.756
I'm no have time!
They'll kill me

14:46.781 --> 14:48.781
if I don't get to the designated point.

14:48.806 --> 14:51.706
You've got to stop now,
I'll defuse the bomb.

14:51.731 --> 14:54.731
No, you can't.
It'll explode.

14:54.756 --> 14:57.856
- Where are you going?
- They said that I must to turn left at 30K

14:57.881 --> 15:00.881
when I get into the tunnel.

15:13.706 --> 15:15.706
- Wait!
- Where is Wu Ying xiong?

15:15.731 --> 15:17.731
Tell me where he is!

15:17.856 --> 15:20.156
He's not here. He's out on duty.

15:21.781 --> 15:23.081
Hey, stop him!

15:23.106 --> 15:25.106
- Out my way!
- What are you doing?

15:27.831 --> 15:31.731
I've figured it out.
It's a Global Positioning System.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.756
GPS..,

15:43.801 --> 15:45.801
Wu Ying xiong,
you have ten seconds

15:45.826 --> 15:48.226
- to say goodbye your criminal friend,
- What?

16:03.651 --> 16:05.851
- You nearly killed me.
- What are you doing?

16:05.876 --> 16:08.676
I have to kill him if he doesn't pull over

16:08.701 --> 16:10.801
because the key to the
explosion is not the time,

16:10.826 --> 16:12.826
but location.

16:15.751 --> 16:17.751
Where is Wu Ying xiong?

16:17.776 --> 16:20.376
- Raise your hands and put the gun down!
- Where is Wu Ying xiong?

16:28.801 --> 16:31.101
You stupid cop! Shoot me!

16:31.726 --> 16:33.726
Why don't you get it, Wu Ying xiong?

16:33.751 --> 16:35.751
You don't have to kill him if
you want him to pull over.

16:35.776 --> 16:38.776
He'll drive on if don't kill him.

16:38.801 --> 16:41.801
Once he gets to the designated point
and the tunnel explodes

16:41.826 --> 16:44.426
there will be no way out of Harbor City.

16:44.751 --> 16:47.151
What are you waiting for?

16:48.876 --> 16:50.876
You'd better be right.

17:01.701 --> 17:03.701
Cross sea Bridge,

17:03.726 --> 17:05.726
High Speed Railway..,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.851
It's the GPS of the explosion sites.

17:09.806 --> 17:11.806
Now it's..,

17:18.631 --> 17:20.631
What are you doing?

17:24.556 --> 17:27.656
You wannna die
or you want me to die with you?

17:27.981 --> 17:29.981
Have you ever thought of me?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.700
Where is Wu Ying xiong?

17:47.725 --> 17:49.725
Get him here!

17:54.800 --> 17:56.800
Southern Substation!

17:59.725 --> 18:03.225
- Look at this, Brother Hulk.
- Green!

18:11.800 --> 18:12.800
Hulk?

18:13.788 --> 18:15.788
Can you hear me, Hulk?

18:17.713 --> 18:20.213
Now I know
why no one likes you.

18:20.738 --> 18:23.238
It's so hard to be your partner.

18:23.763 --> 18:26.863
- Xu Da fu!
- Ah! My Car!

18:26.888 --> 18:30.288
- Stop, Xu Da fu!
- Move! Out my way!

18:30.813 --> 18:32.813
- It's a bomb and it's going to explode!
- Listen to me!

18:32.838 --> 18:34.838
It's going to explode soon!

18:34.863 --> 18:36.863
Xu Da fu!

18:36.888 --> 18:39.288
Get down! Get down! Get down!

18:46.803 --> 18:48.103
I'm alright.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.828
It's broken.

18:49.853 --> 18:52.253
Don't be fooled by the time on it,

18:52.778 --> 18:56.378
It'll explode
when you get to the designated site.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.303
Try it if you don't believe me.

19:03.728 --> 19:06.228
I let you go.
What are you doing here?

19:06.815 --> 19:08.815
So you did let him go
Don't you want to be a hero anymore?

19:08.840 --> 19:10.840
But I don't wanna come back.

19:10.865 --> 19:12.865
I lived peacefully with Xiao qing.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.890
Suddenly a group of bastards came
and took us away.

19:14.915 --> 19:18.815
They hold Xiao qing hostage
and make me do this.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.840
I have to save her.

19:21.765 --> 19:24.365
- You can have my gun.
- Shut up, will you?

19:24.890 --> 19:26.890
I wanna ask him something

19:26.915 --> 19:29.815
Can you tell me who took you away?
What did they look like?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.840
- What do they want you for?
- How the hell do I know?

19:31.865 --> 19:33.865
Can't you see what they want?

19:33.890 --> 19:35.890
He is my criminal.
I'm interrogating him.

19:35.915 --> 19:36.815
Criminal?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.840
He is no longer your criminal
after you let him go.

19:38.865 --> 19:41.865
- By the way, you're a criminal too.
- What are you talking about?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.890
You broke the law when
you let a criminal go.

19:43.915 --> 19:46.815
Hey you guys! Stop referring to me as a criminal.
We're all dead when it explodes.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.840
Defuse the bomb
if you have nothing better to do.

19:49.865 --> 19:51.865
Come on!

19:57.790 --> 20:00.290
Don't go any further, You hear me?

20:04.615 --> 20:06.615
Class 2 alert, everyone.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.700
- We're police.
- Don't move!

20:14.725 --> 20:16.725
Raise your hands!

20:17.750 --> 20:19.950
What are you doing here?

20:19.975 --> 20:22.775
Please be careful.
If you hit the guy over there

20:22.800 --> 20:25.800
whatever important objects
you're tranporting will be gone.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.325
Be careful!

20:29.746 --> 20:32.246
There are lots of explosives here, Captain.

20:32.771 --> 20:34.871
Cuff them and bring them
to the headquarters. What?

20:34.896 --> 20:38.396
Wait, how are you doing?
Those explosives are not ours.

20:38.821 --> 20:42.221
We're police.
We don't intend to rob yu.

20:44.746 --> 20:46.746
Be alert!

21:10.871 --> 21:12.871
We're under attack!

21:12.896 --> 21:14.796
Watch them!

21:14.821 --> 21:16.421
Freeze!

21:18.846 --> 21:20.846
Let's go!

21:24.771 --> 21:26.771
What now?

21:34.706 --> 21:36.706
Come on, Da fu!

21:36.731 --> 21:38.731
Get the keys from my right pocket.

21:39.706 --> 21:41.706
I should run away now, right?

21:41.731 --> 21:44.331
Don't be a fool, Come on.

21:53.806 --> 21:55.106
It's alright.

21:55.831 --> 21:57.831
You won't be able to
uncuff us in five minutes.

21:57.856 --> 22:01.256
In five minutes,
we're all dead.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.381
I'm not your enemy.
Calm down, I'm not your enemy.

22:33.706 --> 22:35.706
What?

22:36.731 --> 22:39.031
Get ready.

23:07.756 --> 23:09.456
You're dying.

23:09.781 --> 23:12.081
Have you regretted it?

23:12.806 --> 23:14.406
I'm scared.

23:14.731 --> 23:16.731
Help me.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.806
Why didn't the ambulance explode?

23:54.831 --> 23:56.831
It's him.

23:56.856 --> 23:59.856
He is the ringleader.
Hey, where is my wife?

23:59.881 --> 24:00.781
Get down!

24:00.806 --> 24:05.206
He is hiding behind the car with that guy
from the Southern substation.

24:15.801 --> 24:18.201
You are so hard to control.

24:18.726 --> 24:21.826
I used the police radio to
get you back the substation

24:21.851 --> 24:23.851
but you're here anyway.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.776
Do you know him?

24:25.801 --> 24:27.801
Hey, hero

24:28.726 --> 24:30.826
your justice shouldn't
have been manifested.

24:30.851 --> 24:34.251
You've sacrificed
the whole Southern Substation.

24:34.776 --> 24:38.776
I've been chasing you for three months.
I thought you were a smart criminal.

24:38.801 --> 24:41.801
So many places have been destroyed
just for grabing.

24:41.826 --> 24:43.826
Don't be childish.

24:43.851 --> 24:45.151
- What are you doing?
- Trying to irritate him.

24:45.176 --> 24:46.976
- Irritate him? And then?
- We'll see.

24:47.001 --> 24:51.701
I'll give you a chance,
If you put your weapons down and surrender

24:51.726 --> 24:54.026
I might let you go.

24:56.551 --> 24:58.551
Go get them.

24:59.676 --> 25:01.676
Da Fu, Come here.

25:05.401 --> 25:06.901
Go.

25:09.706 --> 25:10.806
What are you doing?

25:10.831 --> 25:13.631
I know the bomb explodes once defused.
If you shoot, we'll die together.

25:13.656 --> 25:16.756
Who want to die with you?
I don't wanna die.

25:16.781 --> 25:18.881
Damn it! You use me as your shield.

25:18.906 --> 25:20.906
- Again!
- Look at it.

25:20.931 --> 25:24.431
Do you wanna die together
or let us go?

25:26.656 --> 25:29.456
- Now you leave us no choice.
- Come on.

25:32.701 --> 25:35.301
- You're two of the most stupid cops in the woirld.
- Come on.

25:35.726 --> 25:38.326
Open the trunk./ What?/
Open it.

25:44.701 --> 25:45.901
Go!

25:46.726 --> 25:48.726
Cover me!

25:58.701 --> 26:00.201
Go!

26:00.726 --> 26:02.726
Where is my car going by itself?

26:04.651 --> 26:06.651
Go! Go, go, go!

26:06.876 --> 26:09.276
Stupid cops! This way!

26:13.701 --> 26:16.201
You blew up my car.

26:16.787 --> 26:18.787
Let them go.

26:18.812 --> 26:23.312
We'll reinitate the bomb and blow them up with
the tunnel according to our original plan.

26:29.807 --> 26:31.807
It's a dead end.

26:35.732 --> 26:37.732
Why is it blinking again?

26:39.607 --> 26:42.707
- What happened?
- It's still being renitiated.

26:42.732 --> 26:45.332
- What do we do now?
- Hold this.

26:47.857 --> 26:51.257
- The door is locked once closed.
- We're dead.

26:51.882 --> 26:53.882
We're really dead.

26:53.907 --> 26:58.207
- Don't give up. There still hope.
- Get this device off me.

27:00.732 --> 27:04.132
One, two, three.

27:06.757 --> 27:08.757
What are you doing?

27:08.782 --> 27:10.782
Here!

27:11.807 --> 27:13.807
Throw it in!

27:25.702 --> 27:26.902
Watch out!

27:26.927 --> 27:28.927
What the hell?

27:41.802 --> 27:43.802
What happened?

27:47.727 --> 27:49.727
Now the City is really closed.

27:55.702 --> 27:57.902
We almost died in there,

28:26.802 --> 28:28.802
What's wrong with you?

28:39.807 --> 28:42.207
The shrapnel was shot
through his body, right?

28:45.732 --> 28:47.732
Press it.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.757
I'm dying.

28:49.782 --> 28:51.782
I have to get Xiao qing back.

28:51.807 --> 28:53.807
I know where she is.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.832
The abandoned cement
works by Belt Highway 9.

28:55.857 --> 28:57.857
She is imprisoned with the families
of the other wanted criminals.

28:57.882 --> 29:01.282
What can you do now?
Wait for the ambulance.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.607
No, I can't wait.

29:05.805 --> 29:09.205
It was the happiness that
I ever been waiting for.

29:09.730 --> 29:12.030
I'll lose it if I wait any longer.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.755
If you keep bleeding like this,

29:19.780 --> 29:23.280
you'll die of shock within ten minutes,
let alone save your live.

29:23.769 --> 29:27.269
I thought smelt something
and it turns out you stinking mouth.

29:27.794 --> 29:29.794
Get me a car.

29:38.809 --> 29:40.809
Xiao qing is pregnant.

29:40.834 --> 29:42.834
Seven months.

29:43.759 --> 29:47.059
I don't know it's a boy or a girl.

29:51.604 --> 29:53.604
My leg is numb.

30:03.709 --> 30:05.709
Promise me

30:06.734 --> 30:08.734
that you'll get Xiao qing back.

30:16.809 --> 30:18.809
I will get her back.

30:23.804 --> 30:26.004
I know you'll get her back

30:26.629 --> 30:28.829
You even saved an airplane

30:31.804 --> 30:33.804
I have no regrets.

30:34.729 --> 30:37.029
I lived happily with Xiao qing

30:37.854 --> 30:39.854
for seven months,

30:47.609 --> 30:49.109
Damn!

30:49.834 --> 30:52.134
I don't wanna lose it!

30:54.659 --> 30:56.659
So regretful

31:33.684 --> 31:35.684
Explosion in the Southern Substation?

31:48.809 --> 31:51.109
Captain, the guys in the Substation..,

31:54.811 --> 31:56.811
From now on,

31:56.836 --> 32:00.136
From now on, you are under my watch.

32:04.761 --> 32:07.761
Captain, I have been warmed

32:07.786 --> 32:10.486
with the explosion in the Substation.

32:10.711 --> 32:14.011
I have to hunt them down
before there are more casualties.

32:14.736 --> 32:16.736
I'll hunt them down with you.

32:16.761 --> 32:18.561
Hunt them down? To where?

32:18.886 --> 32:22.086
Are you gonna die for it?

32:22.811 --> 32:25.711
You haven't learned how to
investigate a case, have you?

32:25.736 --> 32:27.936
You can't do it with bluntness and impulse,

32:27.961 --> 32:29.861
Xu Da fu is back now.

32:29.886 --> 32:32.786
With you, being a respected hero,
you know it's your duty

32:32.811 --> 32:34.811
to avoid unnecessary reputation losses.

32:34.836 --> 32:37.936
How can you say that
in a time like this?

32:37.961 --> 32:40.861
Where are you going?
It's the law.

32:40.886 --> 32:42.886
Whether he's dead or alive,

32:42.911 --> 32:44.911
you'll have to be investigated, understand?

32:46.836 --> 32:49.836
I've been in the police force for years
and I haven't met an idiot like you.

32:49.861 --> 32:53.261
I can't let you ruin yourself./
Captain!

32:53.786 --> 32:56.386
Give me your keys, / Captain!

32:56.811 --> 32:58.811
You're not going anywhere.

33:01.736 --> 33:03.736
Captain Chen,

33:04.761 --> 33:07.861
Chen Zhen from the Eastern Substation.
I've heard a lot about you.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.886
What do you want?

33:12.801 --> 33:15.201
Ying xiong, I'm rooting for you.

33:18.626 --> 33:21.226
This relationship between a cop

33:22.851 --> 33:25.151
and a wanted criminal.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.306
But it's okay.

33:32.831 --> 33:35.731
He won't be back
after his death this time.

33:35.756 --> 33:39.056
What are talking about?
What do you know?

33:39.881 --> 33:43.181
Yes, I did let Xu Da fu go,

33:43.806 --> 33:45.906
And yes, he is a criminal by the law.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.231
But do you know how many people he saved?

33:48.856 --> 33:50.456
No one know,

33:50.881 --> 33:53.881
No one knows how much
he did for Harbor City.

33:53.906 --> 33:57.406
No one knows how he risked his life
to go on the airplane with me.

33:58.815 --> 34:01.215
You think that he's a criminal,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
to me, he's my partner.

34:04.855 --> 34:08.355
You will never know how it feels
to lose your partner.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.800
What are you so upset for?

34:13.824 --> 34:15.824
If I didn't irritate you,

34:15.850 --> 34:17.850
all the truth

34:17.875 --> 34:20.175
will never come out.

34:30.812 --> 34:32.812
I have to get out of here.

34:33.837 --> 34:35.837
I have to get Du Xiao qing back

34:35.862 --> 34:37.862
and arrest those bastards,

34:40.806 --> 34:42.806
Help me.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.831
What did you say?

34:49.024 --> 34:51.024
Help me.

34:53.849 --> 34:56.849
The super hero of Harbor
City is asking for my help?

34:56.873 --> 34:59.374
It's no fun anymore, isn't it?

35:01.809 --> 35:03.809
Woii!

35:14.645 --> 35:18.245
You owe me again, you need to pay
me back more than last time.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.900
There's someone behind the rock, Captain.

35:25.925 --> 35:27.425
Let's go!

35:36.724 --> 35:39.224
Where are you going, Wu Ying xiong?

35:40.809 --> 35:43.209
There is indeed someone behind the rock.

35:50.804 --> 35:52.804
Have you got my message?

35:52.829 --> 35:54.829
Let me know..,

35:55.854 --> 35:58.254
Let me know if you're safe.

36:26.779 --> 36:29.179
Hulk! Hang on!

36:38.804 --> 36:41.204
Get me some wood planks.

36:43.805 --> 36:44.905
Hulk's leg..,

36:44.930 --> 36:48.330
It's alright. Let me get it fixed
and they'll get it back later.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.005
Do you need anything, Hulk?

36:55.830 --> 36:59.130
Computer.., Give me a computer.

37:01.612 --> 37:04.612
Has anyone show himself
or asked for ransom?

37:04.837 --> 37:07.137
No, Sir, not as I know.

37:07.862 --> 37:09.862
But we're tracking the signals
from the EMP batteries,

37:09.887 --> 37:11.887
We'll send the Black
Hawks to intercept them,

37:11.912 --> 37:13.812
once we find out where they are.

37:13.837 --> 37:17.237
You must get the EMPs back
and anything else is not important.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.362
Yes, Sir.

37:19.887 --> 37:21.887
The only goal for us is
to complete the mission.

37:21.912 --> 37:24.112
We'll get the EMPs back.

37:24.737 --> 37:27.037
The protected witness is walking
through the security passage

37:27.062 --> 37:29.262
and will be here soon.

37:34.807 --> 37:38.207
Luo Yong zhen, Major Coordinator
of the Special Force.

37:40.802 --> 37:43.702
You're today to explain
the Nidgtwalkers' plan.

37:43.727 --> 37:45.827
You don't have the right
to discuss it with me.

37:45.852 --> 37:49.352
It's about an emergency,
Class 5 priority.

37:50.807 --> 37:53.907
There has been a series of explosions in Harbor
City today and we suspect the ringleaders

37:53.932 --> 37:57.132
to be the Nightwalkers.

37:57.857 --> 37:59.857
They're an armed force af assassination.

37:59.882 --> 38:03.882
What has happened
is not their usual way of doing things.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.907
I cannot answer your question.

38:07.812 --> 38:10.612
We found out from the phone of the chief
from the Department of Defense

38:10.837 --> 38:13.337
that symbol on the hand
belongs to the Nightwalkers,

38:13.862 --> 38:16.762
They've stolen the EMPs
and initiating codes.

38:16.787 --> 38:19.987
What?
You've purchased the EMPs?

38:20.012 --> 38:22.412
Do you know what they're
going to do with the EMPs?

38:22.737 --> 38:24.937
Please escort me out of here.
Out of Harbor City, I mean.

38:24.962 --> 38:27.762
Well
I'll send lots of entourage

38:27.787 --> 38:29.887
to escort you to anywhere you want

38:29.912 --> 38:32.712
as long as you tell me.
What they really want.

38:32.737 --> 38:36.237
What have you found out
since their last mission.

38:36.762 --> 38:40.762
What do you expect from me after I've been
under house arrest for over a year?

38:40.787 --> 38:43.987
Tell me, does that hand belong
to the treacherous commander?

38:44.012 --> 38:47.312
He has the biochemical
weapon Irukanji with him,

38:47.837 --> 38:49.337
doesn't he?

38:51.815 --> 38:55.615
If so, we're all dead.

38:55.840 --> 38:59.740
He has the EMPs and
the biochemical weapon at the same time.

38:59.765 --> 39:01.765
Have you heard of Project Hay?

39:15.800 --> 39:17.800
You should turn your cell phone off
when you're on duty,

39:17.825 --> 39:20.025
it's me, Lan Xi ying.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.850
Are you alright?
How's it going the Substation?

39:22.875 --> 39:25.775
We don't know about the casualties,
but they've got Green and Hulk out.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
And I have something else to tell you.

39:27.825 --> 39:30.725
Hulk found the Global Positioning System
used by the suspects

39:30.750 --> 39:33.150
belongs to the military.

39:33.824 --> 39:35.824
Also, we've intercepted
secret message saying that,

39:35.849 --> 39:39.849
the military has sent out the Black Hawks
to the Circumferntial Highway 9.

39:39.874 --> 39:42.274
I think it's related to this incident.

39:42.799 --> 39:45.199
Okay, I see.
Thank you.

39:47.824 --> 39:50.124
Be careful.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.549
What have you got?

39:53.874 --> 39:55.874
The Black Hawks are here too.

40:00.809 --> 40:02.909
Listen,
the military never cares about human lives.

40:02.934 --> 40:07.234
Do you know how many people died in their
missions during the past five years?

40:08.832 --> 40:10.832
If we strut there with guns
in our hands,

40:10.857 --> 40:13.057
what do you think they kill first?

40:13.834 --> 40:15.334
Wait a minute..,

40:15.859 --> 40:19.859
So you mean
we're facing the perpetrators

40:19.884 --> 40:21.984
and dealing with the Black Hawks too?

40:22.009 --> 40:24.209
Hei, do you really think you're Superman?

40:33.804 --> 40:36.804
Captain, There are two men
lingering outside the works,

40:36.829 --> 40:39.129
They look like the police.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.154
What are the police doing here?

40:42.779 --> 40:45.779
Aren't they busy with the explosions?/
<i>Intercept them, Shi kai.</i>

40:45.904 --> 40:48.904
<i>Kill them if necessary.</i>

40:48.929 --> 40:50.429
Got it.

41:03.854 --> 41:05.854
Here we are.

41:07.879 --> 41:11.679
Leet's make a detour.
Hei!

41:18.804 --> 41:21.904
<i>According to the thermal detector,
there are six enemies in Sections A and B.</i>

41:21.929 --> 41:23.929
<i>The EMP signal source is in Section A.</i>

41:23.954 --> 41:25.954
<i>Team 1 and 2 deal with them.</i>

41:25.979 --> 41:29.179
<i>Team 3 annihilates the
enemies in the control room.</i>

41:29.804 --> 41:32.104
<i>The others follow me to the vantage point,</i>

41:35.829 --> 41:38.829
Sir, let the helicopter
escort you back to the headqurters.

41:38.854 --> 41:41.854
I'm going to the EMP Center.
Even if the EMP is launched,

41:41.879 --> 41:44.979
they have the electricity
there to save everything.

41:45.004 --> 41:47.204
I'll report it to the Minister directly.

42:05.729 --> 42:08.129
Freeze!
Put the gun down!

42:11.804 --> 42:14.704
We're the police./ The situation here
is hard for the cop to deal with.

42:14.729 --> 42:16.829
We have the same goal,
Let's us help you.

42:16.854 --> 42:19.254
Our mission is to annihilate the enemies.

42:19.779 --> 42:21.779
If you impede our mission,
you are our enemies too,

42:21.804 --> 42:24.104
Put the gun down.

42:29.809 --> 42:32.109
What are you waiting for?
Put it down.

42:33.734 --> 42:36.134
Get the hostages! Go!

43:16.702 --> 43:18.702
Initiate the EMP defense procedure.

43:18.727 --> 43:20.827
Pu Zhi gang, the Army
Chief of General Staff.

43:20.852 --> 43:22.952
The initiation is ready.

43:22.977 --> 43:24.977
Authorrization Code; PG00347

43:25.002 --> 43:26.902
Yes, sir.
The initiation is ready.

43:26.927 --> 43:28.927
The authorization code is confirmed.

43:33.602 --> 43:35.902
<i>The EMP defense system initiating.</i>

43:36.727 --> 43:39.727
<i>All teammates,
the Nightwalkers are equal to us.</i>

43:39.752 --> 43:43.152
<i>Be alert
till the last enemy falls.</i>

43:52.807 --> 43:54.807
Attack in ten seconds.

44:00.811 --> 44:03.111
I don't intend to impede your mission

44:03.836 --> 44:06.136
but I have to get the hostages out.

44:10.801 --> 44:13.101
We haven't found any hostage,

44:34.735 --> 44:38.135
Captain, the thermal detected
enemies are all dummies.

44:41.802 --> 44:44.102
<i>Team 3, report to me, What happened?</i>

44:45.827 --> 44:47.827
<i>Team 3, report and answer</i>

44:47.852 --> 44:49.852
Captain?

44:56.807 --> 44:59.448
Report to the headquarters
that we're ambushed in the cement works.

45:03.832 --> 45:06.732
<i>The captain of EMP wants to see you, Sir.</i>

45:06.757 --> 45:09.157
<i>He claimed that you asked him
here to test the rockets.</i>

45:10.802 --> 45:14.802
Captain Zhuang,
you have the key to initiate the EMPs,

45:14.827 --> 45:17.127
Yes, sir.
Sir, you asked me to bring it.

45:18.812 --> 45:21.112
Open the door and let him in!
<i>Come on!</i>

45:42.807 --> 45:45.807
Headquarters, we're being ambushed.

45:45.832 --> 45:47.332
And we need backup now.

46:00.757 --> 46:02.057
<i>Report to me, What happened?</i>

46:02.082 --> 46:04.803
Captain, here is Team 4, we have
incurred big losses from the attack.

46:05.807 --> 46:08.107
Captain, we need back up right now!

46:11.802 --> 46:13.302
All team members, evacuate!

46:19.807 --> 46:21.307
Hang on.

47:07.832 --> 47:09.132
Evacuate!

47:16.747 --> 47:21.147
Changing the codes of
the EMP defense system.

47:22.823 --> 47:24.823
We've got the key and the base.

49:08.848 --> 49:10.348
Captain! Captain!

49:15.823 --> 49:19.123
These are the codes to cancel the EMPs.

49:19.848 --> 49:23.148
You have to find..,

49:26.873 --> 49:28.173
Captain..,

49:29.808 --> 49:34.008
Wu Ying xiong!

49:34.833 --> 49:39.033
I'll let the whole world see
your photo if you don't come out.

50:54.808 --> 50:58.108
<b>'Connection Lost'</b>

51:15.812 --> 51:18.112
Look like that you where
having lots of fun up there.

51:18.837 --> 51:20.337
So much fun, right?

51:28.823 --> 51:30.823
<i>This is announcement from
Southern Substation Comand Center.</i>

51:30.848 --> 51:32.848
<i>Medicial support team has been established.</i>

51:32.873 --> 51:34.873
<i>All the injured officers please go to
Area of 2nd tent for treatment.</i>

51:34.898 --> 51:38.198
Your painkillers, /
Put it there.

51:38.823 --> 51:42.823
You where in a hurry to set up the computer.
What are you looking for?

51:42.848 --> 51:45.848
The Global Positioning
System that Xi ying found..,

51:45.873 --> 51:48.873
It could trace the explosion site,

51:48.898 --> 51:53.798
so there must be a ground control station Maybe
following this clue, we'll find something.

51:53.823 --> 51:56.723
Have you found it yet?/
I have lots of decoding to do.

51:56.748 --> 51:59.148
I need help from my hacker friends.

52:10.873 --> 52:13.173
Do you know how much money

52:13.821 --> 52:16.121
did the military spent to develop
the unmanned attacker?

52:16.846 --> 52:19.146
And you destroyed it just like that?

52:42.801 --> 52:44.301
You think I'm a bad guy?

52:44.826 --> 52:46.326
No, I'm not.

52:46.851 --> 52:48.351
I'm God.

52:49.806 --> 52:52.106
I'm here to give Harbor City a rebirth.

52:54.831 --> 52:59.131
The City needs a chance now

53:01.815 --> 53:03.315
to build a new order.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.140
Right now.
Immediately.

53:10.805 --> 53:14.105
You're a so called hero that
grew up sucking evil blood.

53:14.830 --> 53:16.230
Wthout us, how do you survive?

53:17.813 --> 53:20.113
The evil exists to honor the justice.

53:20.838 --> 53:23.138
You'll realize it someday

53:23.863 --> 53:26.163
that all opposed things co
exist with one another.

53:27.835 --> 53:29.135
No, no co-exist.

53:29.860 --> 53:32.160
I exist to destroy someone like you.

53:33.832 --> 53:35.832
The rocket and the hostages
are on the rooftop now

53:35.857 --> 53:38.157
except Tu Xiao Qian

53:38.833 --> 53:40.873
If you want to stop the
rocket from being launched,

53:41.858 --> 53:45.158
press this botton
and you'll blow up the rocket.

53:46.814 --> 53:48.934
But you'll have to kil several
innocent hostages too.

53:49.809 --> 53:51.809
Saving the world has to pay a price.

53:57.834 --> 54:00.134
I'll make you regret if
you don't kill me now.

54:04.659 --> 54:07.159
You don't have much time left.

54:07.836 --> 54:10.136
Don't waste your last chance to choose.

54:13.833 --> 54:15.133
Come on!

54:28.808 --> 54:30.108
<i>These ten explosions..,</i>

54:38.833 --> 54:41.133
<i>This is a blind world</i>

54:43.858 --> 54:47.858
<i>The night has fallen
You can't see the dawn after dark.</i>

54:47.883 --> 54:50.883
What does he want?/
Project Hay.

54:50.908 --> 54:52.108
What?

54:52.133 --> 54:54.833
Destroy all the civilization and technology

54:54.858 --> 54:56.858
to deprive the enemy of the abilities
to fight back and survive.

54:56.883 --> 54:58.883
Then use the defusing biochemical weapons

54:58.908 --> 55:03.108
and lead your enemy to the self-destruction
without any defense.

55:03.833 --> 55:05.233
Police! Evacuate everyone!

55:05.858 --> 55:08.858
What's worse is
when a city under such an attack

55:08.883 --> 55:10.983
it won't be able to recover
within five years.

55:11.008 --> 55:14.108
<i>We'll examine ourselves thoroughly</i>

55:14.833 --> 55:18.133
<i>when many lives are lost.</i>

55:18.858 --> 55:22.158
<i>So that we
will have a chance af rebirth.</i>

55:30.803 --> 55:33.803
<i>In 1918, the influenza virus</i>

55:33.828 --> 55:37.728
<i>took the lives of 20 million people
and ended</i>

55:37.753 --> 55:39.253
<i>the First World War early</i>

55:41.808 --> 55:43.108
How can we make it?

55:47.833 --> 55:52.833
<i>The Black Death in 1430
killed 75 million people</i>

55:52.858 --> 55:55.058
<i>and started the Renaissance,</i>

55:55.083 --> 55:58.183
We have less than one minute.
What we do?

56:01.808 --> 56:04.908
<i>Today
it's time to purge away your sins,</i>

56:04.933 --> 56:06.933
<i>again,</i>

56:06.958 --> 56:08.958
It'll be too late when we're there,

56:08.983 --> 56:10.283
No, we still have time.

56:12.808 --> 56:14.808
<i>The new Black Death,</i>

56:14.833 --> 56:16.833
<i>Irukanji, will be here soon.</i>

56:16.858 --> 56:18.858
<i>The virus will set you free,</i>

56:18.883 --> 56:20.883
<i>the real freedom.</i>

56:20.908 --> 56:23.108
<i>And clean up all your sins.</i>

56:24.833 --> 56:26.833
What are you doing?/
We have only five seconds now,

56:26.858 --> 56:28.158
The rocket cannot be launched.

56:32.803 --> 56:34.203
No, you can't.

56:35.828 --> 56:38.128
<i>Destruction is beginning of rebirth.</i>

56:47.803 --> 56:50.103
What have we done, Wu Ying xiong?

56:52.828 --> 56:55.128
I've made it./
That great!

56:59.853 --> 57:01.153
It's a blackout.

57:28.808 --> 57:33.108
Hello passengers. The flight is
now ready to reduce the height.

57:48.703 --> 57:51.103
Run!
Hurry up!

58:58.828 --> 59:02.128
It's okay.
Don't cry. It's okay now.

59:59.853 --> 01:00:02.853
It's Huang Shi kai from the Black Hawks,

01:00:02.878 --> 01:00:05.178
Do you hear me?

01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:28.803
Due to the worsening of the conditions,

01:00:28.828 --> 01:00:32.128
the Harbor City is an isolated island now.

01:00:33.853 --> 01:00:35.853
The President is here, Minister.

01:00:40.808 --> 01:00:42.808
According to the International Law,

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:46.793
I'm the Chief Commander from now on. I'm in charge
of all the units in the Navy, Army and Air Force.

01:00:46.858 --> 01:00:49.158
Tell me what's going on.

01:00:50.803 --> 01:00:54.803
Sir, We've lost contact with
the city center for over two hours.

01:00:54.828 --> 01:01:00.128
The electricity, communication
and transportation are all gone.

01:01:00.853 --> 01:01:04.953
When will the backup be here?/
We cannot send the backup now.

01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:06.878
Why not?

01:01:06.903 --> 01:01:09.303
We estimated that our enemy
has initiated the Project Hay,

01:01:09.828 --> 01:01:12.328
The biochemical virus will begin
to spread out immediately.

01:01:12.853 --> 01:01:14.153
Once it's spread out,

01:01:14.878 --> 01:01:17.878
all the people and animals
in Harbor City will be dead.

01:01:17.903 --> 01:01:21.803
What do we know about the virus?/
It's a new biochemical weapon.

01:01:21.828 --> 01:01:25.128
All it's developers
disappears mysteriously.

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.853
No ones know what is and no one can prove

01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:30.178
the existence of Irukanji.

01:01:30.803 --> 01:01:33.303
Is it the biochemical weapon that
has been said internationally

01:01:33.328 --> 01:01:35.428
to be developed with our money?

01:01:57.803 --> 01:02:01.103
You really thought
that he'd terminate

01:02:01.828 --> 01:02:04.128
what he has been planning for so long?

01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:07.853
I fell into his trap once.

01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:10.278
I believed that if we pressed the button
and kill these guys,

01:02:10.803 --> 01:02:13.103
we would save the whole city.

01:02:16.828 --> 01:02:19.128
Hey, don't be sad.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.103
I'm not sad.

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:28.828
They have launched the EMP rocket,
We have to stop the virus from
spreading and save the city.

01:02:28.853 --> 01:02:31.153
But what matters now is how to find them.

01:02:37.878 --> 01:02:41.178
Hei, what can you do without me?

01:02:47.803 --> 01:02:49.803
The wound is getting worse,

01:02:49.828 --> 01:02:51.828
Here, new ointment.

01:02:51.853 --> 01:02:53.853
The medics will be here later.

01:02:53.878 --> 01:02:56.778
Xi ying,
is Ying xiong back yet?

01:02:56.803 --> 01:02:58.364
I have something important to tell him.

01:03:01.828 --> 01:03:05.128
Before the blackout, I found the location
of the bomb monitoring station

01:03:05.853 --> 01:03:08.853
but I didn't have the complete coordinates.
Now it's so chaotic here

01:03:08.878 --> 01:03:11.178
and no one wants to listen to me.

01:03:13.803 --> 01:03:17.103
Do you have a map, Green?/
Map? Yes, here it is.

01:03:28.808 --> 01:03:31.008
This place?

01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:35.133
But it's been isolated,
let alone in a time like this.

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:45.488
This is the hotline in the conference room
of the presidential residence.

01:03:51.803 --> 01:03:56.103
<i>Good evening, Sir.
Are you at a loss about what to do?</i>

01:03:56.828 --> 01:03:58.228
Can you tell us who you are?

01:03:59.853 --> 01:04:01.853
The Nightwalker training officer

01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:03.178
from the Army Special Force.

01:04:03.203 --> 01:04:05.103
No, it's impossible.

01:04:05.828 --> 01:04:09.028
The traiinings of the Nightwalkers
were terminated long ago

01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:12.153
So you're not the real power core,

01:04:12.178 --> 01:04:15.678
<i>Mr. President, the Nightwalkers have
resumed their trainings secretly.</i>

01:04:15.903 --> 01:04:19.803
<i>The military sent the Nightwalkers to
destroy all the personal and evidance</i>

01:04:19.828 --> 01:04:22.928
<i>when they declared that they
were developing Irukanji.</i>

01:04:22.953 --> 01:04:24.953
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

01:04:24.978 --> 01:04:28.178
<i>my father was investigating it at the time.</i>

01:04:28.803 --> 01:04:30.803
The military got the secret message

01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:33.128
and sent to kill my own father

01:04:33.853 --> 01:04:36.153
to prove the loyalty of a soldier.

01:04:36.878 --> 01:04:39.878
What else have the military done
that I didn't know?

01:04:39.903 --> 01:04:42.103
<i>It's too late to blame them</i>

01:04:42.828 --> 01:04:47.128
All you can do now is wait silently for
everything you've done to the world

01:04:47.853 --> 01:04:49.153
to come back to you.

01:04:50.808 --> 01:04:52.108
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:55.133
<i>The Black Death will be here soon.</i>

01:04:58.858 --> 01:05:00.158
Are they closing the town,

01:05:00.783 --> 01:05:02.183
Commander?

01:05:04.808 --> 01:05:06.808
Chief Commander,
I strongly suggest

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:09.733
that we give an order now

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:12.958
to guard the already broken highways
making sure

01:05:12.983 --> 01:05:15.183
that no one will leave the City.

01:05:15.808 --> 01:05:18.808
Otherwise, when the Irukanji
has spreads rapidly,

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:23.133
No one in the City will be survived.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:45.108
Let us get of here!
The virus is exploring soon.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.233
They stopped the rescue at sea.

01:05:49.158 --> 01:05:50.058
No one is leaving.

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.444
Then we'll wait here.
I have to go.

01:06:07.808 --> 01:06:10.708
After the EMP explosion, it will cut
off the electricity and communication.

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:14.733
If they use cars or electricity,
they make a electromagnetic field.

01:06:14.758 --> 01:06:16.158
So?

01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:19.183
I want you to steal
something from the museum.

01:06:29.808 --> 01:06:32.808
When they blindfolded us and
brought us to the rooftop,

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.833
I smelt something stinky,

01:06:34.858 --> 01:06:36.858
There was water everywhere.

01:06:36.883 --> 01:06:38.183
Sewer system.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:41.008
We have to find the sewer system that
they used to transport the hostages,

01:06:41.033 --> 01:06:44.133
The Hall Probe is the only thing
that can detect a electromagnetic field.

01:07:02.858 --> 01:07:05.158
What are you doing?
Robbery!

01:07:17.703 --> 01:07:19.203
You get away, It's mine.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:36.108
Mommy, where are you?

01:07:46.803 --> 01:07:48.203
Mommy!

01:07:54.808 --> 01:07:57.108
Kido, are you alright? Come over.

01:08:09.833 --> 01:08:13.133
Our trensportation by sea is already.

01:08:13.858 --> 01:08:15.858
Have you confirmed the
launch plan tomorrow?

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:19.183
Yes, the waterbetween Harbor City
and the Main Island.

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:27.207
Come, Give it to me now.

01:08:32.803 --> 01:08:35.103
I've found it, Its right here.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.100
Stay away!

01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:05.125
Stay away!

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.149
I said, "Stay away!"

01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:15.805
The EMP Center
or the central part of the Main Island,

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:17.330
both are the best attacking points.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:33.205
I've finally heard something.

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:36.529
Really?
The signal is getting stronger.

01:09:36.854 --> 01:09:38.654
It's near us,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.100
Find an exit.

01:09:49.805 --> 01:09:51.205
Here's a rappel rope.

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:57.130
That crazy son of a bitch
took Du Xiao qing away

01:09:57.855 --> 01:09:59.155
for a reason,

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.180
You'd better be prepared,

01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:31.105
We've finally found the enemy's lair
and you want me to use this?

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:23.730
Hide behind these containers!/
Okay!

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.680
"<font color="#00ffff"><b>Oom</b></font><font color="#ff00ff"><b> S</b></font><font color="#ffff00"><b>T</b></font><font color="#00ff40"> <i>@</i> </font><font color="#ffffff"><b>R</b></font>"

01:14:56.755 --> 01:14:58.155
Woi! Catch!

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.180
You help her or me?

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.105
Without me

01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.130
you can do nothing.

01:16:24.805 --> 01:16:26.105
Where are you going?

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.130
I saw electric wires here.

01:16:36.705 --> 01:16:38.105
Why do they have electricity?

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:04.130
It's Ying xiong.

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.155
Xu Da fu.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.100
And those criminal bombers.

01:17:13.825 --> 01:17:17.125
So these are..,

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.100
It was my dad's coat.

01:18:04.825 --> 01:18:07.125
Happy birthday, Love, Xi ying.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.150
It was the birthday gift
that I gave to him.

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:19.875
No, it can't be, My dad is dead.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.100
I saw him being buried.

01:18:47.805 --> 01:18:51.105
<i>Ruwan Bosch called me again on 5th of July.</i>

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:53.930
<i>He told me that he is in danger</i>

01:18:53.955 --> 01:18:57.855
<i>and he wants to give me the
prototype of Irukanji.</i>

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.980
My dad's voice.

01:19:00.005 --> 01:19:01.905
<i>It was the last message that
he left before he died.</i>

01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:07.130
<i>Now we know how to deal with the virus
so as not to hurt anyone.</i>

01:19:07.855 --> 01:19:09.855
<i>But</i>

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.100
<i>Now the military begins
to fix their eyes on me</i>

01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:18.125
<i>especially after I found out
about the Nightwalkers.</i>

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.100
But I'm not worried about..,

01:19:26.825 --> 01:19:30.125
<i>What I'm worried about
is if it's really Xi en</i>

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.150
<i>what am I going to do?</i>

01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:38.175
<i>Will I prosecute him?</i>

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.100
<i>But I don't think he's the ringleader.</i>

01:19:45.825 --> 01:19:49.125
<i>So many people are involved in this</i>

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.561
<i>The evidance is not complete
so it not possible to prosecute everyone.</i>

01:19:54.725 --> 01:19:56.125
Let's go

01:19:56.850 --> 01:19:58.150
Wait!

01:19:59.805 --> 01:20:01.105
This way.

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.130
Come on, Xi ying!

01:20:06.155 --> 01:20:08.195
No, it's too late.
Go back to Substation for backup.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.180
Ciao!

01:20:25.805 --> 01:20:27.105
Is she the one?

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.100
So they're breeding the
virus in a live body.

01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:46.125
It'll be a live biochemical
weapon after its evolution.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.100
Introduce yourself.

01:20:51.825 --> 01:20:53.025
Wu Ying xiong.

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:55.150
Hello, I'm Du Xiao qing,

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:57.875
The reason I took the risk
for this job

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.100
is all because of him

01:21:00.825 --> 01:21:03.125
No, you go first.

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.150
Go!

01:21:09.805 --> 01:21:11.105
Xiao qing?

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.100
Xiao qing?

01:21:19.805 --> 01:21:22.105
Da fu asked me to pick you up.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.000
So you disn't go to the Main Island
waiting for me by schedule,

01:21:38.025 --> 01:21:40.125
right?

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:50.150
My dear sister.

01:21:50.875 --> 01:21:53.175
Gosh, It is really you!

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.100
What have you done for youself?

01:22:01.825 --> 01:22:03.025
What happened to your voice?

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:05.150
The military determines to kill me,

01:22:06.775 --> 01:22:10.175
They even use the
biochemical weapons on me.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.100
What have you been through
in the past year?

01:22:20.825 --> 01:22:23.125
What is this place?

01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:26.150
So it has been you, right?

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.175
But why?

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.900
Dad left me this place before he died.

01:22:33.925 --> 01:22:36.125
And Irukanji too.

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:39.150
He has been staying here
to trace the military secretly.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:42.175
He thought that he was safe here

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.100
but the military sent someone to kill him.

01:22:50.705 --> 01:22:52.345
So you've planned for what happened today

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:57.130
for over a year.

01:22:58.855 --> 01:23:00.955
You see it as a revenge

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.180
but do you know
how many innocent people you've killed?

01:23:08.805 --> 01:23:10.805
Why does none of you understand

01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.130
what a great plan it is?

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:16.155
Those are called necessary sacrifices.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.980
We only reflect ourselves when
lost of people are dying.

01:23:21.005 --> 01:23:24.105
Rebirth comes after real destruction.

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:27.130
I've planned it so carefully

01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:31.155
that you should be proud of me.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.880
You're out of your mind.

01:23:34.905 --> 01:23:37.105
Do you know what you're talking about?

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.130
You're not Lan Xi en.

01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:44.155
You're not my brother.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:52.180
He has been a brave and righteous man.

01:24:00.805 --> 01:24:03.105
I'm putting you under arrest.

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.130
If Dad's here,

01:24:06.855 --> 01:24:09.155
he will do what I do.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.100
Dad would not do it.

01:24:27.805 --> 01:24:29.805
Shoot me.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.100
Shoot me!

01:24:41.805 --> 01:24:43.105
Why?

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.130
Why you? Why?

01:25:10.755 --> 01:25:12.155
Trust me.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.180
Tomorrow you'll know
what I've done is right.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.100
Report the evolving rate of the virus.

01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:41.125
Report the evolving rate of the virus.
Over.

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:49.150
Show me your IDs.

01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:55.105
Pass

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:09.930
Officer Wu, what are you doing here?

01:26:09.955 --> 01:26:11.155
Isn't it dangerous?

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.180
It's alright.

01:26:13.805 --> 01:26:15.105
Have you found Da fu?

01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:19.130
Brother Xu is safe.

01:26:20.805 --> 01:26:23.805
For the past year,
Da fu has been telling me about

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:25.830
the story of saving the airplane.

01:26:25.855 --> 01:26:27.855
All the kids in our village knew the story.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880
<i>Do you know how I have lived so long.</i>

01:26:29.905 --> 01:26:31.105
Doing what I do?

01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:33.130
Loyalty.

01:26:35.855 --> 01:26:38.155
Now ifs or buts
I'll hold on to you no matter what

01:26:42.735 --> 01:26:45.135
I've always said goodbye to cops.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.380
But this time, I want to say "see you"

01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:07.185
Xiao qing..,

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800
The virus inside you,

01:27:12.825 --> 01:27:14.825
there is no antidote at this stage.

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:18.150
We've tried our best.

01:27:19.805 --> 01:27:22.105
Now the only way is to..,

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:27.130
Destroy it.

01:27:28.814 --> 01:27:32.114
All we can do is destroy the virus,

01:27:36.839 --> 01:27:38.139
It's kicking me so hard.

01:27:43.804 --> 01:27:46.104
How about my baby?

01:27:48.829 --> 01:27:50.129
Any problems?

01:27:55.802 --> 01:27:57.502
What about Da fu?

01:27:58.827 --> 01:28:01.127
Can I see him for the last time?

01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:04.852
I'm sorry.

01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:09.121
Actually we don't really know
which hospital Xu Da fu is in now.

01:28:09.846 --> 01:28:13.146
The communication in the City
have been cut off.

01:28:13.871 --> 01:28:17.171
Even if we look for him now,
I'm afraid it might be too late.

01:28:23.806 --> 01:28:25.206
I'm sorry.

01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:32.101
Officer Wu,

01:28:33.826 --> 01:28:36.126
I know you'll find him.

01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:39.151
Tell him that it's a girl.

01:28:39.876 --> 01:28:41.176
Tell him..,

01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:46.101
The past year is the
happiest time in my live.

01:28:47.826 --> 01:28:49.126
If he weren't so brave,

01:28:50.801 --> 01:28:54.101
I wouldn't know how it feels to be happy.

01:28:55.826 --> 01:29:00.126
If possible,
don't make us suffering.

01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.151
I don't want to frighten my baby.

01:29:04.876 --> 01:29:06.176
Thank you.

01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:17.801
Where are we going?/
We have to find Xu Da fu,
Let them met for the last time.

01:29:17.826 --> 01:29:20.126
Didn't I tell you?
It's really too late,

01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:21.751
So what?

01:29:21.976 --> 01:29:24.536
Do you want me to stay here
and watch them kill a pregnant woman?

01:29:32.801 --> 01:29:34.301
What are you looking for, Ying xiong?

01:29:36.826 --> 01:29:39.026
Ying xiong! Ying xiong!

01:29:39.051 --> 01:29:40.151
What's is it, Green?

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:44.176
Xi ying and I found the man
who's been monitoring the bomb.

01:29:44.801 --> 01:29:48.101
If we get him,
maybe we'll know more about the virus.

01:29:48.826 --> 01:29:50.826
Come on, lead the way, Let's go.

01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:53.251
Take me with you, /
It's too dangerous, you must stay here.

01:29:53.876 --> 01:29:56.876
I've joined the police because of you.

01:29:56.901 --> 01:29:58.901
I'm as diligent as you are.
Take me with you.

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:01.126
I can help you.

01:30:03.851 --> 01:30:06.851
Du Xiao qing is your responsibility now,
please take care of her for me.

01:30:06.876 --> 01:30:09.876
Tell the Captain not to let
anyone touch her before I'm back.

01:30:09.901 --> 01:30:11.301
It's the most important thing now.

01:30:11.826 --> 01:30:13.126
Let's go.

01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:58.101
Why? Why?

01:30:59.826 --> 01:31:02.126
Are you alright, Xi ying?
Are you hurt?

01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:06.151
No, I'm fine,

01:31:08.822 --> 01:31:11.122
He injected something into my neck.

01:31:14.847 --> 01:31:16.147
Is it the virus?

01:31:16.872 --> 01:31:18.172
No,

01:31:18.897 --> 01:31:20.197
he wouldn't do it to me.

01:31:21.822 --> 01:31:24.122
Because he is Lan Xi en.

01:31:24.847 --> 01:31:26.147
He's my brother.

01:31:31.802 --> 01:31:33.102
I'm sorry.

01:31:35.827 --> 01:31:37.127
I'm sorry.

01:31:38.816 --> 01:31:40.216
It's not your fault.

01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:51.141
In my Dad's recording,

01:31:51.824 --> 01:31:53.824
he said that this virus has an antidote

01:31:53.849 --> 01:31:55.249
What is an antidote?

01:31:55.874 --> 01:31:57.174
Antidote?

01:31:58.833 --> 01:32:01.133
You mean
there's an antibody to this virus.

01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:06.101
He must've injected me
with the vaccine against the virus.

01:32:09.806 --> 01:32:11.806
<i>I'm God.
I'm here to give Harbor City a rebirth.</i>

01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:14.231
<i>All the explosions in the
transportation system.</i>

01:32:14.856 --> 01:32:17.856
If the tunnel explodes,
there will be no way out of Harbor City.

01:32:17.881 --> 01:32:19.881
<i>The New Black Death..,</i>

01:32:19.906 --> 01:32:21.306
<i>will be here soon.</i>

01:32:26.801 --> 01:32:28.101
I see,

01:32:28.826 --> 01:32:30.826
He closed the City and released the virus.

01:32:30.851 --> 01:32:32.851
Only he has the antidote.

01:32:32.876 --> 01:32:34.876
Once manages to produce enough vaccines,

01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:37.801
he'll be the one with power.

01:32:37.826 --> 01:32:40.226
Wu Ying xiong
I know where to find him.

01:32:40.851 --> 01:32:43.771
It's supposed to be the only place
in the City that still has electricity.

01:32:48.824 --> 01:32:51.465
They'll send someone here
to destroy everything in fifteen minutes.

01:32:57.849 --> 01:32:59.249
What going on?

01:33:09.816 --> 01:33:12.116
The helicopter was traying to attack!

01:33:40.801 --> 01:33:42.201
Take her away now!

01:33:42.226 --> 01:33:45.226
Don't let anyone take her
without permission from the superiors.

01:33:46.851 --> 01:33:50.151
Come with me.
I'll take you to somewhere safe.

01:33:56.876 --> 01:33:58.276
Shoot me dead now.

01:34:09.801 --> 01:34:12.801
<i>President,
the Southern Substation was under attack
and thet took away the virus.</i>

01:34:12.826 --> 01:34:16.126
I know.
We're using GPS to track their location.

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.851
Has the virus spread out?

01:34:18.876 --> 01:34:20.876
<i>We're not sure.</i>

01:34:20.901 --> 01:34:24.101
<i>The virus doesn't seem to finish evolving
in the pregnant woman's body.</i>

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:28.126
By the way,
the live body they use to breed the virus
is a pregnant woman.

01:34:29.801 --> 01:34:34.101
We've got the satellite images.
And the target stops moving.

01:34:35.826 --> 01:34:38.226
It's the EMP Center.

01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:49.201
I'm near the location now.
Maybe it's the EMP launch site.

01:34:59.806 --> 01:35:02.906
It's the last message

01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:05.131
from the Black Hawk Huang Shi kai.

01:35:27.806 --> 01:35:29.406
You look fine,

01:35:32.801 --> 01:35:34.201
Within one hour,

01:35:34.826 --> 01:35:37.226
we'll take you to the
most populated shelter.

01:35:38.851 --> 01:35:41.151
You'll change the world too.

01:35:43.876 --> 01:35:45.276
Be happy.

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:16.801
Commander, We're reaching the sea
area boundary in fifteen minutes.

01:36:16.826 --> 01:36:20.226
I'll set up the rocket,
ready for the attack.

01:36:20.851 --> 01:36:22.851
<i>There's going to be action
in the Main Island.</i>

01:36:22.876 --> 01:36:25.176
<i>Be prepared!
We will fight back anytime!</i>

01:36:25.801 --> 01:36:27.201
Yes, sir.

01:36:30.806 --> 01:36:33.106
The live body with the virus
hasn't finished evolving yet.

01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:35.231
Well,

01:36:36.856 --> 01:36:38.856
why don't we blow up the EMP Center?

01:36:38.881 --> 01:36:40.881
So the virus won't spread out/

01:36:40.906 --> 01:36:42.906
And Lan Xi en will be no more exist.

01:36:42.931 --> 01:36:45.831
Kill two bird with one stone.
Send fighter planes to blow them up.

01:36:45.856 --> 01:36:48.856
It takes three years
for an electromagnetic program

01:36:48.881 --> 01:36:50.881
to be reset.

01:36:50.906 --> 01:36:54.806
And the EMP Center is used to
preserve all the computer files

01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:57.831
which is the opportunity
for all the people to start a new life.

01:36:57.856 --> 01:37:02.156
So it's also his plan to contain us
because he doesn't think we'll blow it up.

01:37:02.881 --> 01:37:05.881
If they find out our attack plan

01:37:05.906 --> 01:37:07.906
and launch another EMP,

01:37:07.931 --> 01:37:10.831
the Main Island and the fighter planes

01:37:10.856 --> 01:37:12.256
will all be dead.

01:37:17.854 --> 01:37:21.154
Launching of the EMP rocket initiated.

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:06.023
<font color="#00ff40"><b>Oom</b></font><font color="#ff0080"> <i> St@r</i> </font>

01:38:16.804 --> 01:38:18.804
Are you sure it's the way to the rooftop?

01:38:18.829 --> 01:38:20.829
We can only reach
the 100th floor with the elevator.

01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:23.254
And we don't have a helicopter,
this is the only way

01:38:23.879 --> 01:38:26.179
to the control room.

01:38:28.804 --> 01:38:30.204
You'd better be right.

01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:40.229
Let's find another way?

01:38:40.854 --> 01:38:42.254
Didn't you say it's the only way?

01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:49.279
Follow me to climb up.

01:38:49.804 --> 01:38:51.204
Don't fall or you'll be dead.

01:38:55.829 --> 01:38:58.829
It's over 100 floor high.
No wonder you don't have a partner.

01:38:58.854 --> 01:39:00.854
If we don't blow it up,

01:39:00.879 --> 01:39:03.279
the EMP will attack us
and the virus will spread out.

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:05.204
Now is the chance for us.

01:39:06.829 --> 01:39:09.829
We've received the message
from the Black Hawk Huang Shi kai
in Harbor City.

01:39:09.854 --> 01:39:11.854
He has found the locations
of the other EMPs,

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.979
there's still time to stop
it from being launched.

01:39:14.004 --> 01:39:18.904
Okay,
now our second threat is gone.

01:39:18.929 --> 01:39:20.929
I disagree

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.954
Without this place,
the City will be no more.

01:39:22.979 --> 01:39:24.279
What are you planning to do?

01:39:24.804 --> 01:39:26.804
You want the virus to spread out?

01:39:26.829 --> 01:39:28.429
All right, Enough!

01:39:38.804 --> 01:39:40.204
Everyone,

01:39:41.829 --> 01:39:44.129
cities are built up by us.

01:39:45.854 --> 01:39:49.154
As long as we are alive,

01:39:49.879 --> 01:39:52.279
we shouldn't be afraid
of starting over again.

01:39:53.804 --> 01:39:55.204
And

01:39:55.829 --> 01:39:57.829
we can't afford greater sacrifices

01:39:57.854 --> 01:40:00.254
that caused by the virus spreading out.

01:40:06.879 --> 01:40:09.979
So let's pay

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.204
our respects

01:40:13.829 --> 01:40:16.129
to those who sacrifice for this City

01:40:16.954 --> 01:40:21.154
Tell the Air Force
to blow up the EMP Center now.

01:40:30.809 --> 01:40:33.109
Are you the Black Hawks
that are equal to us?

01:40:33.834 --> 01:40:36.134
But you're the only one left.

01:40:44.609 --> 01:40:46.709
The evolving rate the virus is 95% now,
Commander.

01:40:46.934 --> 01:40:49.134
It's estimaed to finish
evolving in ten minutes.

01:40:57.609 --> 01:40:59.609
I never thought tht you'd climb so high

01:41:00.834 --> 01:41:02.934
Welcome to this holy moment.

01:41:02.959 --> 01:41:04.259
Wake up, Lan Xi en.

01:41:04.884 --> 01:41:07.284
Xi ying has told me everything,

01:41:07.809 --> 01:41:11.209
I feel sorry for what you've been through
but what you have done is not justice.

01:41:11.734 --> 01:41:14.934
Justice is to protect people,
not killing them.

01:41:15.059 --> 01:41:16.159
Stop now

01:41:21.804 --> 01:41:23.404
What will you do to stop me?

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:26.929
With the few courage that you've got left?

01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:28.954
If I have some courage, I'll strangle you.

01:41:28.979 --> 01:41:31.079
Get the antidote when
you've got the chance.

01:41:31.104 --> 01:41:34.004
Can you deal with him alone?/
Don't worry about me.

01:41:34.029 --> 01:41:37.029
Whatever happends,
you must get the antidote and Xiao qing.

01:41:37.054 --> 01:41:38.154
Okay.

01:41:48.809 --> 01:41:49.909
Go!

01:42:41.734 --> 01:42:45.234
Operation Dawn is airborne now.
Mission; Destroy the EMP Center.

01:42:53.809 --> 01:42:59.109
Aim the rocket at the EMP Center.

01:43:30.834 --> 01:43:32.234
Start setting procedure

01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:47.809
Operation Dawn is above Harbor City.

01:43:47.834 --> 01:43:50.515
Bearing 142 degrees Estimated to
arrive at thr target in one minute.

01:43:55.859 --> 01:43:59.259
Execute Shooting Cansellation.
Please enter the password.

01:43:59.884 --> 01:44:03.284
Please enter the
cancellation pasword again.

01:44:05.809 --> 01:44:07.209
Are you canceling the launch?

01:44:09.804 --> 01:44:12.204
The launching sequence has been canceled.

01:44:46.809 --> 01:44:49.209
Stop! Don't move!

01:44:50.804 --> 01:44:53.204
I said, "Don't move!"

01:44:54.829 --> 01:44:56.229
Fuck. Such a coward!

01:45:19.817 --> 01:45:22.297
Approaching the target and
waiting for the attack instructions.

01:45:50.702 --> 01:45:53.383
We're within the shooting range
and asking for permission to attack.

01:46:09.727 --> 01:46:13.227
<i>We're going to be out of range
and asking for permission to attack.</i>

01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:32.202
Attack now.

01:46:32.827 --> 01:46:35.227
Copy.
Attack!

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:50.202
The antidote!

01:47:06.827 --> 01:47:08.327
Come on!
Can you steer a helicopter?

01:47:08.352 --> 01:47:10.852
Is it different from driving a car?/
Go get Xiao qing and I'll get Lan Xi en.

01:47:10.877 --> 01:47:12.277
Okay./
Go!

01:47:14.502 --> 01:47:17.202
What wrong./
It's too far./ Go!

01:47:18.727 --> 01:47:19.271
Damn it!

01:47:24.852 --> 01:47:26.852
Damn it, Wu Ying xiong!

01:47:26.877 --> 01:47:28.177
Hurry up!

01:47:30.802 --> 01:47:32.802
Are you alright, Ms Du?
Don't worry.

01:47:32.827 --> 01:47:36.227
I've had thirty hour experience

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:41.252
but this one is completely different.

01:47:44.677 --> 01:47:46.577
The second wave of fighter
planes in position.

01:47:53.802 --> 01:47:56.202
Come with me, Lan Xi en.

01:47:58.827 --> 01:48:00.827
Are you putting me under arrest?

01:48:00.852 --> 01:48:04.252
You can't punish God with the human law.

01:48:04.877 --> 01:48:08.277
The virus has finished envolving.

01:48:08.802 --> 01:48:11.202
Where are you taking Du Xiao qing?

01:48:12.827 --> 01:48:14.327
The bomb's coming! Take off now!

01:48:24.802 --> 01:48:27.802
Come on, Wu Ying xiong!
The building is going to collapse.

01:48:27.827 --> 01:48:29.227
Wu Ying xiong!

01:48:29.852 --> 01:48:31.252
Remember,

01:48:31.677 --> 01:48:34.277
wherever you are, I'll be there.

01:49:09.802 --> 01:49:11.202
Damn! We're dead.

01:49:11.827 --> 01:49:13.227
Damn! We're dead.

01:49:14.852 --> 01:49:16.252
Without the vaccine,

01:49:16.877 --> 01:49:19.277
I'll be the one to blame

01:49:26.802 --> 01:49:28.202
What's the look?

01:49:38.807 --> 01:49:42.207
How could a smart man like me
risk my life for nothing?

01:49:43.832 --> 01:49:47.232
The only vaccine in the world.

01:49:49.707 --> 01:49:51.207
Give it to me!

01:49:51.832 --> 01:49:53.132
Give it!

01:49:53.157 --> 01:49:55.257
Xiao qing, we've got the antidote.

01:49:58.782 --> 01:50:00.882
It's the fighter plane from Operation Dawn.

01:50:00.907 --> 01:50:03.207
Please show your identity,
Black Helicopter.

01:50:04.832 --> 01:50:07.832
It's Chen Zhen from Eastern Substation
and Wu Ying xiong from Southern Substation

01:50:07.857 --> 01:50:09.857
We've got the antidote
and ended the virus crisis,

01:50:09.882 --> 01:50:12.882
Repeat,
we've ended the virus crisis,

01:50:12.907 --> 01:50:14.207
Stop the attack.

01:50:14.632 --> 01:50:16.232
Thanks.

01:51:07.757 --> 01:51:11.157
We're still here today

01:51:11.882 --> 01:51:14.282
because of the human wisdom.

01:51:14.707 --> 01:51:16.807
But the same wisdom
almost destroyed us.

01:51:16.832 --> 01:51:18.832
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:51:18.857 --> 01:51:22.157
She's in a labor!
Out of the way, please!

01:51:22.182 --> 01:51:23.282
Out of the way!

01:51:26.807 --> 01:51:28.207
It's the police!

01:51:28.832 --> 01:51:31.832
Using technology to build up
the city is a part of our lives,

01:51:31.857 --> 01:51:34.257
and we seem to take it for granted.

01:51:34.882 --> 01:51:37.282
But do we, really?

01:51:37.807 --> 01:51:40.207
We tend to forget our beliefs.

01:51:41.832 --> 01:51:44.232
We've passed the test this time.

01:51:45.857 --> 01:51:49.957
But don't forget that
the threat of darkness.

01:51:49.982 --> 01:51:53.282
Is always lurking in the cracks of light.

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:57.207
However, with the dawn coming

01:51:57.832 --> 01:52:00.232
we'll still have hopes.

01:52:01.857 --> 01:52:06.057
The sun will be shining in a
place filled with courage.

01:52:06.082 --> 01:52:07.282
Mr. Xu Da fu?

01:52:07.807 --> 01:52:09.807
Here, it's your baby.

01:52:09.832 --> 01:52:14.232
You can hold her now.
Be careful.

01:52:15.857 --> 01:52:18.257
Look at her.

01:52:23.802 --> 01:52:25.802
She looks more like you.

01:52:25.827 --> 01:52:28.827
But she's a girl.

01:52:28.852 --> 01:52:31.252
She better look like you.

01:52:59.877 --> 01:53:01.877
Officer Wu?

01:53:01.902 --> 01:53:04.002
Yes, I'm Wu Ying xiong.

01:53:04.027 --> 01:53:06.227
Thank you very mudh indeed
for what you did for us.

01:53:55.702 --> 01:53:57.802
All units to the Southeastern District.

01:53:57.827 --> 01:54:00.227
Call for backup!

01:54:06.852 --> 01:54:08.952
There you are.

01:54:08.977 --> 01:54:10.977
I think of my car whenever I'm on duty.

01:54:11.002 --> 01:54:12.902
Well done.

01:54:12.927 --> 01:54:14.127
Now you've got yourself a new car.

01:54:14.152 --> 01:54:16.852
My car was demaged when I was on duty.

01:54:16.877 --> 01:54:19.877
I was supposed to get
a new one from Substation./
Me too.

01:54:19.902 --> 01:54:22.802
But they insisted
that my car was sabotaged by someone.

01:54:22.827 --> 01:54:25.827
It's not my problem./
Not your problem? So it's my problem?

01:54:25.852 --> 01:54:27.152
I don't care..,

01:54:27.177 --> 01:54:30.477
An emgency has just happened in the Southeastern District. Police on duty
nearby provide support immedately. All units to the crime scene now.

01:54:30.802 --> 01:54:32.902
Chen Zhen from Eastern Substation
and Wu Ying xiong from Southern Substation

01:54:32.927 --> 01:54:35.227
We'll be right there.

01:54:37.852 --> 01:54:39.952
Come on, what are you waiting for?

01:54:39.977 --> 01:54:42.077
You have to drive me there, don't you?
