WEBVTT

00:07.529 --> 00:09.400
Okay, so, what did you want
to talk to us about?

00:09.531 --> 00:10.793
Sam, Jay,

00:10.923 --> 00:12.186
in the time that
I've been working here,

00:12.316 --> 00:13.839
I've noticed some
disturbing things.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.885
It started
with these strange,

00:16.016 --> 00:18.844
almost ethereal humming sounds
I would hear every now and then.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.759
I think he's talking
about you, Alberta.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.587
It was like a singer warming up
but kind of off-key.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.372
The hell it was!

00:24.502 --> 00:25.938
Well, it's an old house,

00:26.069 --> 00:27.636
so you might have just
been hearing the wind.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.985
That's what I thought.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.334
But then there's
this one time

00:30.465 --> 00:31.770
my pen was
sitting on the counter,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.946
and it almost seemed
like something pushed it

00:34.077 --> 00:35.339
into the trash can.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.775
Sass dared me.
What was I, not gonna?

00:36.906 --> 00:39.126
Sometimes things fall.

00:39.256 --> 00:42.042
But this is
the weirdest thing by far.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.785
This is security footage
from the front desk

00:46.916 --> 00:48.222
from the other night.

00:50.224 --> 00:53.183
See that?
No one is there,

00:53.314 --> 00:54.967
but the keys are moving.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.622
- Huh.
- Now, you guys are gonna
think I'm crazy,

00:57.753 --> 01:00.277
but there's only one plausible
explanation for all this.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.237
You guys have...

01:08.372 --> 01:09.852
Did you hear me?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.506
I said I think
you guys have ghosts.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.160
That's a little far-fetched.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.162
Yeah, I mean, you don't really
believe in ghosts?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.425
Oh, they're gonna try to
make him think he's crazy.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.080
It's really the only play here.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.255
I mean, there's no other
explanation for this.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.256
The keys are moving.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.170
Are they?

01:23.300 --> 01:24.127
What?

01:26.173 --> 01:27.739
There's not even a question.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.133
I-I don't see anything.
I mean, do you, Jay?

01:30.264 --> 01:33.702
I'm squinting really hard,
and nope.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.183
Uh, Sam, we have a problem.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.488
Freddie sold Sass's girlfriend.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.142
What?

01:39.273 --> 01:40.143
I-I mean he got
a new car and sold

01:40.274 --> 01:41.405
the RAV4 she was bound to.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.973
Uh, Freddie, did you
get a new car?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.540
Yeah, actually.
How did you know?

01:45.670 --> 01:48.934
A ghost told me.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.329
Just kidding, obviously.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.070
I-I saw you pull up in it.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.941
It's pretty nice.
Look at it.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.508
It's got all-wheel drive.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.554
You know what it doesn't have?
My girlfriend!

01:59.684 --> 02:03.558
Also doesn't have leather seats.
Why not splurge?
Sam,

02:03.688 --> 02:06.517
you got to buy Freddie's car
back. Please do it for me.

02:06.648 --> 02:09.607
Jay, Sass wants us to
buy Freddie's car back.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.653
What? We have the Mini.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.220
And I know it's not haunted,

02:13.350 --> 02:15.004
but it's got a year left
on the warranty.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.573
Plus, Freddie's old car sucks.

02:18.703 --> 02:19.748
Jay, we don't even have
to use it.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.097
We can just park it
on the lawn,

02:21.228 --> 02:22.533
and Sass gets to
hang out with Jessica.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.187
You want us to buy
a lawn car?

02:24.318 --> 02:26.929
To just sit on the lawn?
Who are we, Tony Stark?

02:27.059 --> 02:28.539
Who's Tony Stark?

02:28.670 --> 02:29.888
I'm so glad
you asked that question.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.803
Come here. Okay,
it all started off

02:31.934 --> 02:33.283
in a cave in Afghanistan.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.371
Or Vietnam...

02:34.502 --> 02:37.026
Thor want to see
where this going.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.856
Oh.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.336
Freddie, what do you
have there?

02:42.466 --> 02:44.555
So, for my own
peace of mind,

02:44.686 --> 02:46.818
I did some research
and ordered a few items

02:46.949 --> 02:48.298
that should take care
of the ghost problem.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.257
Problem? How dare you?

02:50.387 --> 02:52.563
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.218
I know you're skeptical,
but better safe than sorry.

02:55.349 --> 02:58.308
First off, a classic
ghost repellent, sage.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.962
Ooh, we love that stuff.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.920
Oh, I call first hit.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.575
And this detects
electromagnetic energy,

03:04.706 --> 03:06.316
which is what ghosts
are made up of.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.579
I'm not rooting for him, but
the science is darn interesting.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.233
It'll tell us if there are
any ghosts nearby.

03:16.848 --> 03:17.719
We're all clear.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.549
This stuff is all <i>fakakta.</i>

03:21.679 --> 03:23.986
And finally,
the coup de grÃ¢ce,

03:24.116 --> 03:26.597
the Ghost Trap 2000.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.295
I ordered it
on the Internet

03:28.425 --> 03:30.122
from a Latvian company
that specializes

03:30.253 --> 03:31.776
in ghost-hunting equipment.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.822
Latvians known for technology.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.911
Take regular club and add
metal spikes to it.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.739
Very smart.

03:37.869 --> 03:41.003
Oh, my God, there is a sticker
that says "Two and under."

03:41.133 --> 03:43.179
It is a toy for babies.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.224
Latvians.

03:44.354 --> 03:47.270
What a strange toy
for a toddler.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.881
I mean, what's wrong with
a simple stuffed raven

03:50.012 --> 03:51.970
or a good old-fashioned
lead rattle?

03:52.101 --> 03:55.409
Am I right?
Parents these days.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.107
Hmm. What's going on?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.587
Jay tracked down the guy
who bought Freddie's car.

03:59.717 --> 04:00.718
Thing is, uh,

04:00.849 --> 04:02.154
I need this car
for my band.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.852
You know, we're just
starting to take off.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.680
You ever hear of
Pungent Stench?

04:05.810 --> 04:08.378
- No.
- Well, uh, we opened for 'em.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.771
Uh, look, Marco,

04:09.901 --> 04:11.860
I think $1,500 is more
than a fair price. Right?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.123
I mean, I know you only paid
$1,300 for it.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.473
And I know you seem
pretty desperate,

04:16.604 --> 04:18.562
so I'm gonna hold firm.

04:18.693 --> 04:20.651
Jay, how's it going?
My relationship's on the line

04:20.782 --> 04:21.957
and Jay's pinching pennies.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.132
It's going great.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.829
I got him right where
I want him.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.135
No, you don't.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.354
Please, Sam,
you have to step in.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.704
What Sass and I have
is magical.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.924
You're talking to Champa
Arondekar's baby boy, bro,

04:33.055 --> 04:35.623
and if you think I'm paying
full price for that,

04:35.753 --> 04:37.364
you are sorely mistaken.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.322
Jay, just pay him.
We need the car.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.976
Ha-ha, she's kidding.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.325
We're walking.
Good day, sir.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.545
What do you want for it?$1550.

04:44.675 --> 04:45.546
That's fair. Sold.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.852
Yes! You can stay.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.985
Champa can never
know about this.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.467
Why is there a cookie
on top of it?

04:53.597 --> 04:55.991
I think that was Freddie's
attempt to bait the trap.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.950
But ghosts can't even eat.
Freddie so dumb.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.388
It does look rather
scrumptious, though.

05:01.518 --> 05:04.042
I wouldn't mind taking
a little whiff.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.044
Mm-hmm, yes,
a whiff would be divine,

05:06.175 --> 05:07.219
but one would need
to get very close

05:07.350 --> 05:09.221
to properly smell the cookie,

05:09.352 --> 05:11.398
and in doing so one might
accidently touch the device.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.052
- So what?
- It's not dangerous. Indeed.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.315
As we've already established,
it's most certainly

05:15.445 --> 05:16.881
- a children's toy.
- All right.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.492
Yeah.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.797
But, on the off chance
it is a functioning ghost trap,

05:19.928 --> 05:21.016
it wouldn't be safe
with all of us

05:21.146 --> 05:23.018
crowded around, jostling
and shoving,

05:23.148 --> 05:24.541
trying to get our sniffs in.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.021
Well, maybe one of us
should just touch it

05:26.151 --> 05:27.762
and make sure it's okay.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.242
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but great minds think alike.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.332
One of us should
touch the trap.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.072
And as the commanding officer,

05:34.203 --> 05:36.988
that responsibility
should fall to me...

05:37.119 --> 05:38.773
to pick the person.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.601
Pete, do it.
What?!

05:40.731 --> 05:41.950
Why me?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.691
Why don't we draw straws?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.301
Because that would require

05:45.432 --> 05:46.955
the handling and cutting
of straws,

05:47.085 --> 05:49.087
which is beyond
our abilities.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.263
Look, Jay left his nerd dice
out on the table.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.483
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.051
I knock a dice off,
whosever number comes up,

05:56.181 --> 05:58.314
that's who touches the trap.
Capisce?

05:58.445 --> 05:59.837
All right. Yeah.

05:59.968 --> 06:00.882
Not a bad idea.
Yeah, yeah.

06:01.012 --> 06:01.752
- Okay.
- Capi-- capisce.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.726
So what are we thinking,
two out of three, or...?
Pete,

06:18.856 --> 06:22.207
I say this with love,
but we're wasting valuable,

06:22.338 --> 06:25.341
valuable sniffing time.
Now get in there.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.343
Okay.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.607
Uh...

06:35.307 --> 06:37.092
Yeah, I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.311
Oh, big surprise,
coward man being coward.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.097
Well, if you're so brave,
why don't you touch it?

06:43.359 --> 06:47.189
You challenging Thor's manhood?

06:47.319 --> 06:49.844
From over here I am, yeah.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.151
Fine, I'll touch it.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.980
Thor not afraid.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.727
See? Nothing to wor...

07:04.946 --> 07:06.948
Thor! Thor!

07:08.558 --> 07:10.168
What is this?

07:10.299 --> 07:12.214
Hey, babe, did we get
a new toaster?

07:12.954 --> 07:15.217
Ooh.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.003
Thor's in there!

07:19.134 --> 07:21.136
- Thor's in there! Hey!
- Now we know.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.534
I just wanted to let you
know how much I enjoyed

07:27.664 --> 07:29.013
my stay this weekend.

07:29.144 --> 07:32.060
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't even sure

07:32.190 --> 07:36.281
I wanted to travel anymore
after my Walter passed.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.718
Samantha, a word, please.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.197
Thank you for sharing that.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.025
That's what I love
about running a B and B.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.332
Connecting with the guests.
Being there for you.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.987
Thor got sucked
into the ghost trap.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.206
Tomorrow would have
been our 47th... I got to go.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.037
Okay, so what happened?

07:53.168 --> 07:56.301
Well, there was an Oreo on top
of this weird toaster thingy,

07:56.432 --> 07:58.608
and I ate it, which made me
realize I was still peckish,

07:58.739 --> 08:00.131
so I made a sandy.

08:00.262 --> 08:03.004
Thor touched the device
and is now trapped inside.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.396
Why was he touching it?

08:04.527 --> 08:05.397
Wait, what happened?

08:05.528 --> 08:06.703
That is a ghost trap,

08:06.834 --> 08:08.357
and apparently
Thor touched it,

08:08.488 --> 08:09.837
and now he's trapped inside.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.622
A ghost trap?
And you knew about this?

08:12.753 --> 08:14.494
Well, none of us actually
thought it worked.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.799
Why didn't you consult me?

08:15.930 --> 08:17.758
You got a weird sci-fi thing
in the kitchen,

08:17.888 --> 08:20.630
and you didn't think to ask
the guy wearing the Atari shirt?

08:20.761 --> 08:22.023
You were dealing with the car,

08:22.153 --> 08:23.241
and the ghosts are
sort of my thing.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.156
Oh, 'cause you can see
and hear them.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.376
Yeah, yeah, way to rub that
in my face again.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.073
Uh, hello?

08:29.204 --> 08:32.250
Perhaps there's more urgent
matters to discuss!

08:32.381 --> 08:33.991
Yeah, the big guy's
got a point.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.297
Or is it the little guy?
What do we call him now?

08:35.427 --> 08:37.038
Hey-hey, Thor, it's Pete.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.822
Uh, sorry about this whole
turn of events.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.520
I can't help but feel,
I don't know,

08:40.650 --> 08:42.130
a little bit responsible.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.653
Now, before you say
that's crazy... Not crazy.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.786
This is very much
your fault, Pete.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.439
Okay, cool. So we're
on the same page.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
So how do we get Thor
out of the trap?

08:49.311 --> 08:51.269
Why don't we just ask Freddie?
He's the one who ordered it.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.097
But we made such a big deal
about not believing in ghosts.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.752
Just go speak with him.
Yes, you'll look foolish,

08:55.883 --> 08:58.015
but that's nothing new.
Bite the bullet.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.582
Oh, you know that expression
came from my era.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.715
We had to literally bite bullets
during surgery

09:01.845 --> 09:02.629
because we lacked anesthesia.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.587
And how did that work out?

09:04.718 --> 09:07.024
Mm, sort of depended on
how good your barber was.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.026
Oh, don't worry, Thor.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.462
We are gonna go
talk to Freddie.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.812
Everything's gonna be okay.

09:11.942 --> 09:12.987
What's going on?
What happened to Thor?

09:13.117 --> 09:15.293
Oh, my dear, he's being
held captive

09:15.424 --> 09:16.643
inside that machine.

09:16.773 --> 09:17.644
You were standing right here
when it happened.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.776
Wow. This machine?

09:19.907 --> 09:22.431
Flower, no!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.738
Wait, why'd it turn red?
Did Thor get out?

09:24.868 --> 09:26.653
Not exactly.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.699
JESSICA [chuckles]:
Whoa, so we really did it.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.396
Yep, we sure did.

09:31.527 --> 09:34.051
That was exciting,
our entire relationship

09:34.182 --> 09:35.705
riding on the outcome
of a car negotiation.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.752
And then Jay asked him to
throw in that Pungent Stench CD.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.362
Man, could have gone
either way.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.363
Oh, yeah, man.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.759
So, what do we do now?

09:45.889 --> 09:49.284
I guess we just sort of hang.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.938
Okay. Yeah.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.114
So, what do you guys like
to do around here for fun?

09:53.244 --> 09:54.811
Well, I usually watch TV
with the other ghosts.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.596
- It's sort of a nightly thing.
- Mm-hmm.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.206
Oh, but I guess
you can't do that.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.555
Yeah, I can't really go inside.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.252
Right. Right.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.168
But, um, I mean,
that's okay, you know.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.344
I'm a car ghost, and I got
two new drivers

10:06.475 --> 10:08.433
to take me on all
their adventures.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.305
The thing is, Sam and Jay don't
really drive that much.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.959
You know, they work
from the house.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.482
Right, but they go on errands, right?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.354
Hmm, not that many. You know,
plus they got the Mini.

10:16.485 --> 10:20.141
Okay. So I'm just
gonna be, like,

10:20.271 --> 10:23.666
sitting here in this car
in the driveway forever?

10:23.797 --> 10:24.754
No, no, I can ask Sam
to take you

10:24.885 --> 10:26.190
for a spin
every now and then.

10:26.321 --> 10:29.150
Like I'm a dog she's
taking on a walk.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.978
No, I'm-I'm not saying
it's gonna be like

10:31.108 --> 10:32.893
a twice-a-day thing
that a dog would get.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.809
So it's less good
than a dog?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.419
My situation.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.728
Oh, wow, would you look
at the leaves

10:41.858 --> 10:42.685
blowing around
over there?

10:42.816 --> 10:44.469
Isn't that fun?

10:44.600 --> 10:49.126
We don't usually get wind
from the north, so, uh...

10:49.257 --> 10:52.956
Hey, uh, Freddie, say you caught
a ghost in the trap.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.915
How would one go about
releasing it?

10:55.045 --> 10:57.918
Ha. So now you think there's
a ghost caught in the trap.

10:58.048 --> 10:58.875
Freddie, we don't really
have time for this.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
Just get on board.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.749
Well, the ghost indicator light
did come on, so...

11:02.879 --> 11:04.620
Oh, but I thought you said
you didn't believe in ghosts.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.230
Two follow-up questions?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.144
The foreman at the factory
would have given him

11:07.275 --> 11:08.668
a swift crack on the jaw.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.060
But what if I was wrong?

11:10.191 --> 11:11.105
Wouldn't it be sad
if a ghost <i>was</i>

11:11.235 --> 11:12.846
trapped in that little box?

11:12.976 --> 11:14.674
I mean, what if it was
a friendly ghost, like Casper?

11:14.804 --> 11:16.458
Or Obi-Wan in <i>Empire.</i>

11:16.588 --> 11:19.417
Well, Obi-Wan wasn't
really a ghost per se.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.158
Excuse me. He was
an apparition representing

11:21.289 --> 11:24.205
- a recently deceased Jedi.
- Right,

11:24.335 --> 11:25.597
but I would argue
that was more a manifestation

11:25.728 --> 11:27.251
of his Force powers.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.992
Huh. Okay,
that's interesting.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.124
You know, I really think
it all just depends

11:30.254 --> 11:31.821
on Lucas's
intentionality...

11:31.952 --> 11:32.953
I'm so sorry.
Can we get back

11:33.083 --> 11:34.868
to the whole
ghost in the trap thing?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.957
Sort of a crazy tangent with our
friends' existence on the line.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.959
I was riveted.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.874
Thor, Flower,
Freddie's on the phone

11:41.004 --> 11:42.310
with the company
in Latvia.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.094
He's gonna find a way
to get you out of there.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.574
Are we sure we want
to give them that hope?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.097
I mean, it's very possible

11:47.228 --> 11:49.099
they're just stuck in there
forever now.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.448
Just giving heads up.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.798
Can still hear,

11:51.928 --> 11:52.886
even when you lower voice!

11:53.016 --> 11:55.236
Oh, my God, you guys!

11:55.366 --> 11:56.541
Thor's stuck in a ghost trap!

11:56.672 --> 11:57.891
Wait for it.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.502
Oh, my God.
I'm in here with him.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.200
It should've been me. It was
my number that came up.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.636
Oh, Peter,
don't beat yourself up.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.681
There'll be plenty of time
to ruminate

12:05.812 --> 12:07.204
on your cowardice later.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.685
Okay, I spoke
to the customer service rep.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.426
There's a button
on the side,

12:11.556 --> 12:13.558
and all we have to do is
hold it for three seconds.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.560
Okay, perfect. Let's do that.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.911
Whoa, you don't want
to ask me? Atari shirt.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.521
Sorry, Jay.
What do you think?

12:19.651 --> 12:21.218
I think we should do it.
I just wanted to be asked.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.832
Okay. One, two, three.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.052
Light turn red.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.838
Why do light turn red?

12:31.968 --> 12:34.710
Oh, that's not good.
Freddie, what does that say?

12:34.841 --> 12:36.538
- Uh, I don't know Latvian.
- It's counting down to something!

12:36.668 --> 12:38.975
- What is it counting down to?
- Let me check.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.543
Oh, this is interesting.
"Evisceration..."

12:41.673 --> 12:42.892
What?!

12:43.023 --> 12:44.764
"Countdown to evisceration."

12:44.894 --> 12:46.678
Oh, that is not good.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.203
Unless you're right and ghosts
don't exist. Then we're fine.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.682
Freddie, just fix this.

12:50.813 --> 12:51.901
All right,
I'll give them a call back.

12:52.032 --> 12:52.989
Oh, my God, you guys.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.904
Thor's stuck in a ghost trap!

13:00.214 --> 13:01.955
Very bad news.
Freddie's still on hold

13:02.085 --> 13:03.478
and says it's a 20-minute
wait to talk to someone.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.959
B-But we only have four minutes
left on the evisceration clock!

13:06.089 --> 13:07.917
I led with
"This is very bad news."

13:08.048 --> 13:09.658
- He did say that.
- He just said that.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.920
- As he was walking in.
- That's very fair.

13:12.356 --> 13:16.970
Well, it seems like
we're gonna die. Again.

13:17.100 --> 13:21.888
If Thor must go, happy
to at least spend

13:22.018 --> 13:24.064
final moments with Flower.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.414
Aw, that's nice.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.895
I like when you say
stuff like that.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.505
More so than when you talk about

13:30.635 --> 13:32.507
dismembering Danish people.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.466
Thor have many sides.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.904
Thor very well-rounded.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.516
What if you just smash
the device, Samantha?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.170
Perhaps that'll
set them free.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.172
Isaac's saying maybe
we could smash the trap.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.782
But it could hurt them.
And even if it didn't,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.002
what if when they get out
they're permanently small?

13:49.132 --> 13:51.613
- Oh.
- Thor not want
to be permanently small!

13:51.743 --> 13:54.529
Base much of identity
on being large.

13:54.659 --> 13:55.922
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.967
What if "Two and under"
isn't about age?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.795
Maybe it's
the number of ghosts

13:59.926 --> 14:01.362
the trap was designed
to hold.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.017
Maybe it's only able to hold
a certain amount

14:04.147 --> 14:05.496
of ghost energy.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.455
Not that I endorse
his lifestyle, but

14:07.585 --> 14:09.326
this is where having
- a nerd can be useful.
- Look at this gauge.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.241
It went up
when Thorfinn got trapped.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.939
It's gone higher
since Flower went in there.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.724
A third ghost could
push it into the red zone.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.160
What happens if it goes
into the red zone?

14:17.291 --> 14:19.423
Well, hopefully it
overloads the system

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
and causes the device to fail,

14:21.034 --> 14:22.513
which should free
all the ghosts.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.602
Unless he's wrong,

14:24.733 --> 14:27.257
and then we've eviscerated
three ghosts.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.173
Unless you're wrong, and
now we've lost three ghosts.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.393
Look, I know I can't see
the ghosts or hear them,

14:32.523 --> 14:34.395
but I care about them,
and I would never do anything

14:34.525 --> 14:35.744
to risk harm to them

14:35.875 --> 14:37.180
if I didn't think
with all of my heart

14:37.311 --> 14:38.921
that this could work.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.750
You know what,
I think you're right.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.058
Okay, you all heard the man
in the Atari shirt.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.798
I think we got
to give this a shot.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.322
And now one more of us
is gonna die

14:48.452 --> 14:49.671
so that Jay feels heard.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.760
So, Jay's saying that
if one more ghost

14:51.891 --> 14:55.285
jumps in the box,
we might be saved.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.548
But who will be our third?

14:57.679 --> 15:00.987
Why does it always
come down to this?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.553
Hey, Sam, do you think
you can take Jessica out

15:02.684 --> 15:03.990
for a little drive?
She's wanting

15:04.120 --> 15:05.469
to go to the mall,
whatever that means.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.341
We're a little busy
- right now, Sass.
- Mm-hmm.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.256
Thor and flower are caught
in the ghost trap.

15:09.386 --> 15:12.520
And then Samantha activated
an evisceration clock,

15:12.650 --> 15:13.913
and now Jay wants
another one of us

15:14.043 --> 15:15.653
to go in there and save them

15:15.784 --> 15:17.394
or, just as likely,
die along with them.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.961
What?!
Fellow ghosts,

15:19.092 --> 15:20.745
the time has come for
one of us to step up.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.313
And as your
commanding officer,

15:23.444 --> 15:25.359
I believe it is only right
that that responsibility

15:25.489 --> 15:27.317
falls to, this time,
let's say Trevor.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.492
What? Why me?

15:28.623 --> 15:30.059
I'll do it. Pete,

15:30.190 --> 15:31.017
are you sure about this?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.323
I always played it safe in life,

15:33.454 --> 15:35.499
always worried that
something bad would happen.

15:35.630 --> 15:39.112
And you know what,
something bad happened anyway.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.288
And now my friends' afterlives
hang in the balance,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.420
and it's my fault
that they're in there.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.422
So, am I scared?
You betcha.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.990
But am I going in?
You're darn tootin'.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.126
And I know, when I look back
on all of this...

15:53.256 --> 15:54.170
The clock is sort of
ticking here, Pete.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.694
Ten seconds to evisceration.

15:56.825 --> 15:57.957
So, I know we didn't finish yet,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.001
but, Sam, who won
<i>Game of Thrones?</i>

15:59.132 --> 16:00.742
- I don't remember.
- Cool.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.183
Oh, hey, just so you guys know,

16:07.314 --> 16:08.619
I'm here now, too.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.231
Oh, no, that's not what
I meant.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.406
No, no, no, no.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.537
Hey, is it working?

16:13.668 --> 16:14.495
I think so.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.062
Something is happening.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.541
Of course, it might just be

16:17.672 --> 16:19.500
the evisceration process
coming to a climax.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.810
- My God!
- What happened?

16:25.941 --> 16:27.116
They're back.

16:27.247 --> 16:30.076
Pete saved the day.
So did you.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.121
Good news.
Turns out we just need to

16:32.252 --> 16:34.080
turn it off
and then turn it back on.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.865
Huh.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.475
And then Pete jumped
in the trap,

16:38.606 --> 16:39.824
and I thought he might die,
which would mean

16:39.955 --> 16:41.130
I would get my own room,

16:41.261 --> 16:42.653
but now how I'd want
that to happen.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.046
And then everyone was saved,

16:44.177 --> 16:46.353
and it was just
a crazy day.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.442
Yeah, it sounds amazing.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.922
Yeah. I wish you could
have been there.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.230
Yeah, me, too.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.189
Maybe we did... Look, Sass, I...

16:56.319 --> 16:59.583
Er, no. You-you go first.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.281
Okay.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.935
Maybe we didn't
think this through.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.198
I mean, I'm crazy about you.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.417
I'm crazy about you.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.289
But you're never gonna be
a part of all the fun stuff

17:09.419 --> 17:10.681
that happens in the house.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.988
Yeah, and it's not
really fair for me

17:13.119 --> 17:14.337
to force you to hang out with me

17:14.468 --> 17:16.209
here in the driveway
all the time.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.604
You know, if I'm being
completely honest,

17:20.735 --> 17:22.215
I miss the road.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.826
So what do we do?

17:29.526 --> 17:32.921
Thorfinn wants Pete to know
that today

17:33.052 --> 17:34.966
you earned my respect.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.403
From this day forward,

17:36.533 --> 17:39.449
you are no longer
known as Puny Pete.

17:39.580 --> 17:43.018
You're now Puny Brave Pete.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.846
Thank you, Thor.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.804
And you inspired me, Pete.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.980
You faced your fears,
and it showed me

17:49.111 --> 17:50.547
that I should face mine, too.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.680
You're gonna watch a TV show
with clowns in it?

17:52.810 --> 17:53.985
God, no.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.683
I'm gonna go on a date
with Thor.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.164
Just Thor.

17:58.294 --> 18:01.776
Really?
A one-on-one date?

18:01.906 --> 18:04.344
You truly mean this?

18:04.474 --> 18:06.085
I do.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.002
If things get weird, though,
can we at least go

18:11.133 --> 18:12.743
hang out in a room
that Jay is in or something?

18:12.874 --> 18:14.745
Sure. Of course. Yes.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.226
Samantha?
Freddie's quitting again.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.445
We just heard him
call his mommy.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.882
Hey, guys, I have something
I need to tell you.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.710
- You're quitting?
- How'd you know?

18:22.840 --> 18:23.972
Lucky guess.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.452
Are you sure
about this, buddy?

18:25.582 --> 18:27.106
I know it's been
a rough couple weeks, but...

18:27.236 --> 18:28.803
Rough?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.457
You guys fired me once,
drove me to quit another time,

18:30.587 --> 18:32.676
then you bought my old car,
which was weird.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.853
Not to mention you caused
my girlfriend to dump me.

18:35.984 --> 18:36.941
Yeah, it does sound bad
when you list it

18:37.072 --> 18:37.942
all at once like that.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.683
And on top of all that,

18:39.814 --> 18:41.642
I don't want to work in a house
that I think has ghosts.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.600
- Rude.
- Freddie,

18:43.731 --> 18:45.211
I know what we've had
our growing pains

18:45.341 --> 18:46.299
working together,
but I really think

18:46.429 --> 18:47.648
the worst of it
is behind us.

18:47.778 --> 18:48.823
If you stay,

18:48.953 --> 18:49.998
we promise it'll
be different.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.088
Oh, hell no.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.874
I'm out of here.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.529
What the hell, Alberta?

18:59.660 --> 19:00.748
He almost killed
three of us.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.924
That's fair.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.409
Yo, wait, wait, hold on.
I don't understand.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.453
So, now you want to sell
the car back?

19:10.584 --> 19:13.239
Well, I believe
New York State has

19:13.369 --> 19:15.284
a cooldown period that
this falls within.

19:15.415 --> 19:18.157
Bro, I'm not CarMax, okay?
I'm a guy named Marco.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.506
Look, I'll tell you what.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.508
I'll give you half
of what you paid for it.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.162
What's going on here?

19:23.292 --> 19:24.859
Sass and Jessica decided
that they moved in together

19:24.989 --> 19:25.947
too quickly,

19:26.077 --> 19:28.079
so Jay now has
to sell the car back

19:28.210 --> 19:29.646
from a position of weakness.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.909
Fine.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.478
But I'm keeping
the Pungent Stench CD.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.132
So, life with Marco
will be nice.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.134
He said his band's
going on tour?

19:39.265 --> 19:42.703
Yeah, so I'm, you know, gonna
get to see a lot of the country.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.748
And he really likes KFC,

19:44.879 --> 19:47.577
so I've got some good smells
- coming my way.
- Nice.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.319
I'm gonna miss you, Jessica.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.192
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sasappis.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.803
You're really special.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.108
What?!

19:57.239 --> 19:59.633
I said you're
- really special!
- What?!

19:59.763 --> 20:02.201
You're really special!

20:02.331 --> 20:05.987
You smell good, too!
What?!

20:09.730 --> 20:10.948
Oh, that's a tough
turn of events.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.168
Indeed.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.996
We're here for you, Sass.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.519
Thanks, guys.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.132
Okay, well,
we were here for you,

20:21.263 --> 20:22.612
and now we're gonna
go watch some Tv.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.135
But feel free
to come find us,

20:24.266 --> 20:25.963
and we'll be there
for you there.
