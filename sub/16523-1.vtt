02:09.196 --> 02:12.597
Hey, slow down.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.294
People see you working
this hard,

02:14.334 --> 02:16.700
they're gonna expect me
to work hard,

02:16.737 --> 02:19.001
and that's not gonna happen.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.005
It's fine, Mom. It's fine.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.784
Oh, there's nothing left.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.433
What the fuck happened here?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.744
Po, I made a little mess.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.214
Po...

03:36.249 --> 03:39.047
Po, we've got this.
Everything's fine, all right?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.179
No, not everything's fine,
Angelina!

03:45.726 --> 03:48.695
I work all day for this shit!

04:05.312 --> 04:06.472
Hey.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.681
Thanks for picking me up.

04:14.721 --> 04:18.281
Yeah, well,
it isn't a Cadillac, but...

04:18.325 --> 04:20.190
Bobby drives a Ford.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.591
Bobby drives a Ford...

04:21.628 --> 04:23.095
Put your seat belt on.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.621
Okay, let's rock and roll.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.793
Andrew, did you wear
this shirt yesterday?

04:28.835 --> 04:30.462
Well, yeah.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.664
Let's do laundry on Saturday.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.729
- What?
- Yeah.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.832
Okay, let's do it.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.335
Sorry.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.956
Hey, watch the furniture,
will you?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.053
What are you...

04:56.096 --> 04:57.427
You're too cute.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.663
Here, take this. I got to go.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.137
Thanks for the ride.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.662
Drive careful.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.062
Hey, I'll have
what she's having...

06:07.100 --> 06:08.499
with whiskey.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.093
Sure.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.935
You're, like, the prettiest
girl in the world.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.813
- Come on.
- Yeah.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.354
Yeah, okay.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.587
Good night, Sheila.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.856
Good night, kids.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.527
Man, look at you...

07:16.836 --> 07:20.328
Your skin, your waist.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.908
You're so beautiful.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.646
You don't even know.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.019
You wouldn't possibly
understand.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.486
You should take pictures.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.389
What?

07:44.764 --> 07:46.356
I'm serious.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.890
You're serious about what?

07:48.935 --> 07:51.096
You meet Vaughn last night?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.536
He owns the studio
my band played in.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.370
He's shooting some girls
for a new website.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.601
What are you talking about?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.744
You could do a shoot with him.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.147
If Vaughn's looking for girls,

08:04.184 --> 08:07.347
what does that have to do
with you?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.958
No, never mind.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.621
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.823
Then why did you bring it up?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.663
There's not...

08:24.938 --> 08:27.031
Look...

08:27.073 --> 08:28.734
Spark me.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.616
$500.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.952
It's an awful lot of money

08:43.990 --> 08:45.981
for running around
in your underwear.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.895
I mean, are you gonna wash
other people's laundry forever?

09:02.675 --> 09:06.304
And toss half your money
to your drunk-ass mom?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.278
Babe, you leaving?

09:15.321 --> 09:18.984
No, this is what I look like
when I'm staying.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.517
Well, it's not like nobody's
ever seen you naked before.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.223
Fuck you.

09:42.015 --> 09:46.111
Most people answer quick
in remembering my own brief...

09:46.152 --> 09:47.585
Hey!

09:47.620 --> 09:49.520
Jo, it's too loud,
and you're sitting too close.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.922
Oh, what if I sit over here?

09:53.993 --> 09:55.654
Okay.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.229
Ann frankly,
I don't like where it's going.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.564
I don't like it one little bit.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.593
Did you eat yet?

10:06.973 --> 10:09.203
I'll make something.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.792
Want half a sandwich?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.058
No, I'm good.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.895
I'm gonna eat later.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.299
We're all eating later.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.896
If you always wait
till the next meal,

12:18.938 --> 12:20.428
you'll starve to death.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.963
Okay.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.982
Hey, do you know
where I can find Vaughn?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.689
Okay, thank you.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.899
Vaughn?

13:27.940 --> 13:30.465
Hi. I'm Angelina.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.875
Thanks for coming in today.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.503
Yeah, no time like the present.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.782
Bobby told me you were
the most beautiful girl

13:36.816 --> 13:37.942
he's ever seen.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.781
Yeah, well,
Bobby likes to say that

13:39.819 --> 13:42.049
when he doesn't know
what else to say...

13:42.088 --> 13:43.453
Or when he's done
something wrong.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.515
You're 18, right?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.153
Last I looked.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.753
Please.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.059
Okay.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.666
It's pretty simple
what we do here,

13:56.703 --> 13:59.968
just some photographs,
which we load behind a pay wall.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.133
Okay.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.700
You sure you want to do this?

14:04.744 --> 14:06.234
Yeah.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.941
Yes.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.744
Why?

14:10.783 --> 14:13.616
Because we want you to do this.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.678
We pay $300 for the first shoot,
but since you're new,

14:15.722 --> 14:18.122
you could do five shoots
your first week, you know.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.215
Nobody's seen you yet.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.885
Okay, that's not enough.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.121
That's what we pay.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.789
Well,
what are you paying Bobby?

14:24.831 --> 14:27.163
He gets a referral.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.191
A referral's $100.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.260
You can get one too
if you bring somebody in.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.737
No, I need $500.

14:32.772 --> 14:36.139
So come shoot again tomorrow,
and you'll have $600,

14:36.175 --> 14:38.234
$300 a day.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.767
Well, I don't know
that I'm gonna want

14:39.812 --> 14:41.074
to come again tomorrow.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.379
Do you know something I don't?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.181
In advance.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.883
People tell you
you're difficult?

14:50.923 --> 14:54.256
I bet you hear that
all the time.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.498
Yeah?

15:04.871 --> 15:06.133
That's nice.

15:06.172 --> 15:09.505
That's nice, but, like,
confident, more confident.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.105
Open your legs a little bit.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.407
Gorgeous.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.274
Gorgeous.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.023
I like that little bit
right there.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.256
Hey, baby.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.594
Quiet on the fucking set, dude.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.123
Cuddle time is later, okay?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.658
Fuck.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.734
Relax.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.675
So you're just, you know...

15:44.710 --> 15:46.575
you're just lying around
at home, you know.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.636
Lean back.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.912
Watching television,

I have a test today,
English Lit.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.765
Well, you're gonna do great.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.702
You're the smartest person

19:31.737 --> 19:33.898
I'm so proud of you.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.242
You turned out so great

I love you.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.239
All right, on our way.

20:16.348 --> 20:17.838
That's all you brought?

20:22.588 --> 20:24.078
Yeah.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.491
What do you think
San Francisco's gonna be like?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.353
Different.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.667
Yeah, me too.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.364
Different.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.859
So I found an ad on craigslist

21:01.894 --> 21:04.226
for a guy who had
a room available.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.560
Right? Yeah?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.895
Yeah, so I emailed him,

21:06.932 --> 21:08.932
and he said that we could
come by tomorrow morning.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.265
How much is he asking for?

21:10.302 --> 21:11.428
Well, he didn't say,

21:11.470 --> 21:13.097
but he said that
it was super cheap.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.107
Right on, yeah.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.473
Yeah, so, I mean,

21:17.510 --> 21:19.068
I guess we could go
check it out.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.773
Yeah, yeah, we could, yeah.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.187
Comfortable?

21:36.228 --> 21:39.129
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.792
This is okay.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.494
Yeah.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.840
Thanks for coming with me.

21:48.874 --> 21:51.035
What else was I gonna do?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.256
What time is it?

22:05.291 --> 22:08.089
It's 9:00. 9 o'clock.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.247
- All right, well, we're
supposed to be there at 8:30,

22:10.262 --> 22:11.695
so come on.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.163
- Wait...
- No, it's 24th.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.530
It's right here.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.228
It's on this side.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.504
Andrew, come on.
It's not that heavy.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.837
It's not that heavy.
It's not that heavy.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.244
34.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.110
Here we are, right here.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.150
Hello?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.852
Paco!

22:40.893 --> 22:42.451
I'm glad you guys
could make it.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.621
My roommate left,
but I can't tell my landlord,

22:44.663 --> 22:46.392
'cause I need to hold on
to my rent control,

22:46.432 --> 22:48.696
so this is all under the table.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.895
Yeah, of course.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.534
You guys can set your stuff
right there if you want.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.907
Oh, thanks.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.070
Cool place.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.409
- Thank you.
- I like your pillows.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.210
Oh, thanks.
My sister made them.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.375
Oh, I like them.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.714
It's great you guys
are a couple.

23:06.752 --> 23:08.344
You're gonna save
a lot of money that way.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.445
This city is expensive.

23:09.488 --> 23:10.614
There is only one bed.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.021
We're not a couple.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.218
But this is perfect.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.888
It's great, right?

23:16.929 --> 23:17.953
- Okay.
- It's amazing.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.055
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.588
Yeah, exactly what we need.
Thank you.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.759
Okay. Hi.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.858
Yeah.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.426
Okay, perfect. This is great.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.267
Good to... all right, guys.
This is perfect.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.863
All right, let's unpack, yeah?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.476
Can you believe it?

23:37.316 --> 23:38.715
Oh, man.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.684
That's not fair. Come on.

23:44.723 --> 23:47.590
I do. I...

23:47.626 --> 23:49.253
That's just stupid.
That's not...

23:49.295 --> 23:51.263
Yes, I am, okay?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.731
Yes, legally, I am old enough.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.660
Mom, just put JoJo
on the phone.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.572
What do you mean,
she doesn't want to talk to me?

24:08.580 --> 24:10.810
Don't say that.

24:10.849 --> 24:11.907
Don't say that, Mom.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.748
That's not true,
and you know it.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.789
Please put JoJo on the phone.

24:27.533 --> 24:30.400
Why do you think
that I'm upset?

24:30.436 --> 24:32.666
Will you please stop yelling
at me, okay?

24:32.705 --> 24:36.607
I'm calling you because I want
to see how you guys are.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.634
Mom, please put JoJo
on the phone.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.008
Mom.

24:48.253 --> 24:49.550
You're, like, invincible.

24:49.588 --> 24:50.987
You're... 50 bytes.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.115
No.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.997
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.056
Nothing.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.967
I'm good.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.528
Hey.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.000
Hey, come here.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.076
What's wrong?

25:20.119 --> 25:23.384
JoJo won't talk to me.

a man will give away everything
just for a few hours of tease.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.279
Hey, Dara, can you put this
in my bank for me?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.713
- Yeah.
- You know what?

27:29.748 --> 27:33.240
- What?
- You should dance.

27:33.285 --> 27:37.119
You know,
you'd make more money.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.386
I don't know.
I think I'd feel weird about it.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.518
About being naked?

27:42.561 --> 27:45.394
With your legs?

27:45.430 --> 27:47.796
Can I get a glass of water?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.960
Well, I did do pictures once.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.026
Really?

27:51.069 --> 27:53.128
Before I moved up here.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.697
If you're okay
with taking pictures,

27:55.741 --> 27:57.470
you should hook up with BOD.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.636
They pay their girls
$800 a day.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.579
$800 a day?

28:02.614 --> 28:03.706
Just for pictures?

28:03.749 --> 28:07.583
Well, it depends
on what you do, but...

28:10.422 --> 28:12.788
Well, why haven't you done it?

28:12.824 --> 28:14.689
I have a lot of cousins
that watch too much porn,

28:14.726 --> 28:16.523
and they think
I'm a social worker.

28:16.562 --> 28:17.620
Oh, nice.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.028
That's really nice.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.199
Yeah.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.260
Hey, I think someone might
have brought party favors.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.101
Come on. Let's go check it out.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.401
Come on.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.601
Come on. Let's go check it out.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.418
No, thanks. I don't...

28:59.004 --> 29:01.802
Okay.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.572
I'm new at this...

29:10.616 --> 29:12.914
Yo, Paco!

29:17.289 --> 29:19.120
- Hi.
- Your turn.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.523
Oh, well, actually,

29:21.560 --> 29:26.088
I think my friend could use
a little attention.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.565
I'm getting married tomorrow.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.965
He is, so...

29:30.002 --> 29:33.096
So I'm never gonna be
happy again.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.197
It's his last night...

29:35.240 --> 29:37.868
Last night of happiness.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.241
Where am I?

29:42.881 --> 29:44.348
Where did you take me, Francis?

29:46.818 --> 29:48.547
Just enjoy it.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.351
Hi.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.414
Your turn.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.220
Easy, cowboy Easy there.

29:54.259 --> 29:56.523
- It's okay.
- All right, hey.

29:56.561 --> 29:58.051
Just... all right. Stop that.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.257
That's enough.
Just get your hands off of me.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.766
Stop it.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.233
- Hey, hey.
- I said get off of me.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.964
All right, let's go. Let's go.

30:06.004 --> 30:07.596
Come on, man.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.266
- I got to go.
- I'm not done with you.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.570
I know. I just...

30:10.609 --> 30:12.440
I got to go. I'm sorry.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.349
Hey, sorry about that.

30:18.383 --> 30:19.944
You better go catch up
with your friend,

30:19.985 --> 30:22.419
or you're not gonna have
anyone to play with.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.786
Right.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.264
There is nowhere like this
in Long Beach.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.326
Of course there is.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.770
You just have to know
where to look.

30:39.771 --> 30:40.999
You don't have to look here.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.597
That's true.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.900
Here, if you stand still,
the thing will find you.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.678
Yo, Paco.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.478
Come on.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.882
Oh, they're getting away.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.682
Bye, boys.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.052
Good night.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.948
We could walk.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.755
Hello!

31:02.794 --> 31:04.694
Show some leg.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.655
I'm corrupted.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.657
I'm happy, man.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.798
Careful.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.978
Hey, did you have fun?

31:31.022 --> 31:32.580
Sorry.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.023
I didn't mean to wake you.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.391
No, you didn't.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.089
Okay, maybe you did.

31:39.831 --> 31:43.062
Paco... is a lot of fun.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.172
You know, someday you're
gonna meet the perfect person,

31:48.206 --> 31:50.367
and they're gonna be wondering
where you've been hiding

31:50.409 --> 31:52.673
all this time.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.872
Why do you say that?

31:56.948 --> 31:59.109
Because I believe it.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.958
What if I find
the perfect person,

32:10.996 --> 32:13.487
and she doesn't find me back?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.449
What's your rate
for strap-on D.P.?

34:16.420 --> 34:17.513
Okay, well...

34:18.757 --> 34:21.748
Just email me your availability
for April, okay?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.226
- Hi.
- Hi, you must be Cherry.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.592
Yeah, hi. How are you?

34:25.630 --> 34:26.891
Jake. We spoke on the phone.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.024
Oh, yeah.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.469
Your pictures are incredible.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.496
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

34:35.540 --> 34:40.500
So the first question
that I always ask everyone,

34:40.545 --> 34:43.275
and there's no right
or wrong answer, is,

34:43.315 --> 34:45.943
why do you want to do porn,

34:45.984 --> 34:49.248
and why do you want to do it
with BOD?

34:49.286 --> 34:52.222
Okay, well, I just...

34:52.257 --> 34:54.225
I like to try new things,

34:54.259 --> 34:57.854
and it seems like it's a better
schedule than the clubs.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.126
Those are good reasons.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.656
Yeah, we can definitely give you
new things.

35:02.701 --> 35:03.690
Good.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.726
So you saw our website,

35:05.770 --> 35:07.730
and you know generally
what it is that we do here.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.071
Did any of it look fun?

35:10.108 --> 35:13.441
Yeah, the fucking machine site.

35:13.478 --> 35:16.208
Looked really, like,
interesting.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.442
What was interesting
about them?

35:18.483 --> 35:21.077
It just looked exciting.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.816
It looked like
a really intense experience.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.347
Fucking machines
is more about performance.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.654
Are you into performance?

35:28.693 --> 35:31.662
I guess so.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.298
Okay.

35:34.332 --> 35:37.233
So a lot of what we do here
is fetish.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.168
Fetish is not about sex.

35:39.204 --> 35:41.001
It's about power play.

35:41.039 --> 35:45.476
So would you feel comfortable
playing a top or bottom?

35:45.510 --> 35:49.742
Well, I haven't really done
any of that before,

35:49.781 --> 35:50.907
so I don't know.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.280
Well, if you decided to,

35:52.317 --> 35:55.775
then you would generally
start out as a bottom,

35:55.820 --> 35:58.482
and that means you would be
the one being tied up,

35:58.523 --> 36:00.218
and then you can be a top,

36:00.258 --> 36:03.489
but everybody has
their own preferences, so...

36:03.528 --> 36:06.554
Okay, well, that's something
I can think about.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.631
Okay, I just have
a few more questions,

36:09.668 --> 36:11.898
and I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.928
It's just good to get
all this stuff out of the way.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.372
Yeah.

36:16.408 --> 36:19.809
So how do you feel about girls?

36:19.844 --> 36:23.302
I like them.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.407
Have you ever had sex
with a girl?

36:27.352 --> 36:31.482
Oh, you move really fast.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.686
We can take as long
as you'd like, so...

36:34.726 --> 36:36.785
Okay.

36:36.828 --> 36:40.229
Would you feel comfortable
with a girl touching your chest?

36:40.265 --> 36:44.497
Yeah, sure.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.096
But no guy-girl penetration.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.072
Not on camera, I don't think.

36:49.107 --> 36:52.474
What about transgender?

36:52.510 --> 36:53.602
What about them?

36:53.645 --> 36:55.806
Okay.

36:55.847 --> 37:00.443
We have you down
for a solo masturbation scene

37:00.485 --> 37:02.009
and a striptease.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.884
Yeah.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.389
And your rate is $500.

37:05.423 --> 37:06.447
Yeah.

37:06.491 --> 37:07.856
Okay, great.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.520
Okay, so the first one
is just a consent form.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.723
I just need you
to initial the boxes

37:12.764 --> 37:14.459
saying that you know
what you're doing here

37:14.499 --> 37:16.558
and consenting to what
we just talked about.

37:16.601 --> 37:17.625
Okay.

37:17.669 --> 37:22.197
The second form
is just your 2257,

37:22.240 --> 37:23.841
and just make sure
you fill out your name

37:23.875 --> 37:26.241
exactly as it appears
on your driver's license.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.240
We've all heard that one
before.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.449
Right, which is how
it starts with them, you know?

37:38.490 --> 37:40.051
As you soon as you start
doing boy-girl,

37:40.058 --> 37:41.923
that's when they start to have
a problem with it.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.394
You got to decide for yourself
what you want to do.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.728
Looks like someone's
getting paddled today.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.290
Got that right.

37:49.334 --> 37:52.428
Can you believe that dick-face
Robbie is still calling me?

37:52.470 --> 37:53.801
Who else is he gonna call?

37:53.838 --> 37:56.773
You know nobody's ever
rocked his world that hard.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.605
He wants to own me.

37:59.744 --> 38:01.371
I'm into Cynthia now.

38:01.412 --> 38:02.674
Oh, who's Cynthia?

38:02.714 --> 38:05.080
This totally hot chick
I met at Cock-Block.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.550
She's kind of
a preacher's daughter.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.644
Speak of the devil.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.780
Are you nervous, sweetie?

38:11.823 --> 38:13.313
I'm okay.

38:16.261 --> 38:19.958
Okay, actually, I'm...
I'm a little bit nervous.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.488
I've done this before, though.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.296
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.767
You're working
with Margaret today.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.327
She's the best,
and everyone loves her.

38:26.371 --> 38:27.895
Oh, good.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.463
Okay, cool.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.668
Who you worked for?

38:31.709 --> 38:34.610
A company down south,
So-Cal Hotties.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.204
- Vaughn.
- Yeah.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.976
Vaughn is a douche bag.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.541
He's always trying to fuck
the new girls with their rates.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.519
I hope you got paid.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.045
Yeah, I got paid.

38:45.089 --> 38:48.058
Well, this place
is much better.

38:48.092 --> 38:51.084
You should do
a Girls Club shoot.

38:51.129 --> 38:55.361
Pays $800,
takes the same time as a solo.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.163
We could do it together.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.567
She hasn't even
gotten naked yet.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.628
You're already hitting on her?

39:00.672 --> 39:01.798
No.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.003
All right, check yourself out.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.730
Hi, cutie.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.961
You stopping by on your way home
from school?

39:32.003 --> 39:33.129
Well, you can stay with us

39:33.171 --> 39:35.696
until your parents
come pick you up.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.731
Is this your first time
shooting for BOD?

39:37.775 --> 39:39.436
Yeah.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.711
You're so sweet, such a sweet,

39:42.747 --> 39:45.238
innocent little girl.

39:45.283 --> 39:48.047
Why don't you introduce yourself
to everyone watching?

39:48.086 --> 39:50.850
Hi, I'm Cherry.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.584
Cherry...

39:52.624 --> 39:54.057
You're gonna lose
your cherry today.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.957
How exciting.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.293
A little birdie told me
you like to be watched.

39:59.330 --> 40:00.456
I don't mind.

40:00.498 --> 40:01.590
Of course you don't mind.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.033
You're a beautiful, hot,
gorgeous girl,

40:04.068 --> 40:06.400
and you like attention, right?

40:06.437 --> 40:07.597
A little bit.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.901
Oh, yeah.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.965
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
looking at us like that.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.249
Why don't you spread your legs,

40:12.277 --> 40:15.337
give us something to look at
while we talk?

40:17.715 --> 40:19.580
You're a naughty girl.

40:19.617 --> 40:21.881
I think you're trying
to get us turned on.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.911
Give me a close-up.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.620
Why don't you touch yourself?

40:27.659 --> 40:29.149
You know you want to.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.693
Okay, go wide.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.097
Oh, you can't help yourself?

40:36.134 --> 40:38.534
You're so fucking hot.

40:38.569 --> 40:41.538
I know that feels good,
doesn't it?

40:41.572 --> 40:44.700
We're not gonna let you cum yet,
though, not yet.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.607
There's still plenty of time
until you have to go

40:46.644 --> 40:49.169
do your homework.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.874
We want to see you strip.

40:50.915 --> 40:53.315
Just do it really slow.

40:53.351 --> 40:57.344
Entertain us, and then
maybe we'll let you cum.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.829
You're so hot.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.494
Look at your sexy bra,

41:14.539 --> 41:16.700
naughty little schoolgirl.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.679
Oh, my God.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.050
You're so beautiful.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.817
Your ass is so hot.

41:33.257 --> 41:35.782
The anticipation.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.592
Oh, my God.

41:54.379 --> 41:57.371
You're a work of art.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.617
And cut.

42:34.652 --> 42:36.210
Thank you.

42:37.889 --> 42:38.981
Nice.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.047
Thanks.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.426
That was beautiful.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.026
It was really good.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.162
Thank you.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.501
Really.

42:54.539 --> 42:56.029
Thank you.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.632
You live around here?

42:57.675 --> 42:59.973
Yeah, I don't live
too far away.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.411
Well, I hope we get to work
together again.

43:02.447 --> 43:03.539
Me too.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.482
It was a lot of fun. Thank you.

43:36.681 --> 43:38.342
Hey.

43:38.382 --> 43:39.906
What are you reading?

43:39.951 --> 43:43.284
Just a magazine.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.154
Oh, arts.

43:46.190 --> 43:47.851
Geisha exhibit
over at the Banks.

43:47.892 --> 43:51.692
Do you come here
looking for girls who read?

43:51.729 --> 43:54.721
No, I just wanted to apologize
for the other night.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.561
Don't worry about it.

43:58.603 --> 44:00.563
You're not the first group
of frat guys to come in

44:00.571 --> 44:02.198
and make asses
out of yourselves.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.208
I'm a little old to be
a frat guy.

44:04.242 --> 44:06.073
Apparently not.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.179
Are you gonna have a drink?

44:09.213 --> 44:10.510
There's a minimum.

44:10.548 --> 44:13.039
Sure, your choice.

44:14.752 --> 44:16.583
Yeah?

44:28.466 --> 44:30.127
My choice.

44:37.208 --> 44:41.508
So you should really go see
that exhibit.

44:41.546 --> 44:43.411
It's great in person.

44:45.650 --> 44:48.346
It's just a magazine
that somebody left lying around.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.513
Yeah, but you can read.

44:50.555 --> 44:53.115
Yeah, I can read.

44:53.157 --> 44:54.181
Nice.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.118
Do you want another one?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.330
I won't spit in it this time.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.490
Oh, sure.

45:11.676 --> 45:13.473
I thought we were going
to the movie tonight.

45:13.511 --> 45:16.309
I told you. I'm sorry, okay.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.338
I forgot.

45:18.382 --> 45:21.840
But I'm just gonna be gone
for a couple of hours, okay?

45:21.886 --> 45:23.251
Let's just do something
tomorrow.

45:24.956 --> 45:28.517
I'm working at the bookstore
tomorrow.

45:28.559 --> 45:32.086
Well, we can plan something
for when you finish.

45:32.129 --> 45:33.391
Okay?

45:33.431 --> 45:37.197
I'll be waiting for you
like a damsel in distress.

45:37.235 --> 45:38.702
We'll can go to a movie,

45:38.736 --> 45:42.172
or you can finish telling me
about Anna Karen-nina.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.298
Ka-ren-in-nah?

45:43.341 --> 45:44.399
Ka-rin...

45:44.442 --> 45:45.932
I'm tired.

45:55.486 --> 45:57.613
Someone's got a date.

45:57.655 --> 46:00.624
Yeah, I'm going to a party.

46:00.658 --> 46:02.219
I don't really know
how to dress for it,

46:02.260 --> 46:04.387
so I borrowed this
from somebody at work.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.055
Well, bring me the leftovers.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.189
I will.

46:07.231 --> 46:08.832
Hey, your mom left a message
last night

46:08.833 --> 46:10.460
at, like, 2:0 in the morning,

46:10.501 --> 46:13.299
and she said
she wants to visit.

46:13.337 --> 46:14.429
I'm sorry.

46:14.472 --> 46:15.672
Oh, no. No, it's fine with me.

46:15.673 --> 46:16.873
I mean, I'll take her dancing.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.342
No, you don't need to do that.

46:29.687 --> 46:33.248
Well, have a great night.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.020
Thank you.

46:35.059 --> 46:37.584
You too.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.152
- Okay, bye, guys.
- Bye.

46:44.201 --> 46:45.600
Well, you said
that it was a party,

46:45.636 --> 46:49.094
but you didn't say
it was this kind of a party.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.836
Well, some people only have
this kind of a party.

46:51.876 --> 46:52.968
Francis.

46:53.010 --> 46:55.410
My baby's finally arrived.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.141
The parties
I've thrown for him...

46:57.181 --> 46:59.274
He's finally shown up
to one of mine.

47:00.451 --> 47:01.884
You must be Angelina.

47:01.919 --> 47:05.116
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, hi.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.056
This is Mrs. Larchmont,

47:07.091 --> 47:09.491
the chairwoman
of the acquisitions committee

47:09.527 --> 47:12.394
and the proud sponsor
of this exhibition.

47:12.430 --> 47:13.522
Oh, cool.

47:13.564 --> 47:16.158
And proud mother
of this handsome boy.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.189
You didn't tell me that.

47:17.234 --> 47:20.397
Well, it's really something.

47:21.806 --> 47:23.103
Where did it all come from?

47:23.140 --> 47:26.769
Well, this is the most
expensive exhibition

47:26.811 --> 47:30.679
in the history of the museum,
cost three husbands.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.344
Francis says that you work
at a strip club.

47:35.386 --> 47:36.910
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

47:36.954 --> 47:41.254
Well, actually, I'm working
somewhere else now.

47:41.292 --> 47:42.554
That's right.

47:42.593 --> 47:44.322
Well, I better head over
to the Rodin court.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.330
The mayor's stopping by
to pick up a check.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.162
Okay, good to meet you.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.031
I'm sorry.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.968
About what?

47:53.003 --> 47:54.994
That I told her
where you worked.

47:58.843 --> 48:00.970
I... I liked it.

48:01.011 --> 48:04.174
What, that I told her that
you worked at a strip club?

48:04.215 --> 48:07.651
Well, you know,
you didn't hide me.

48:09.019 --> 48:10.316
All right, come on.

48:10.354 --> 48:12.447
I didn't bring you here
to introduce you to my mom.

48:12.490 --> 48:14.253
I want to show you something.

48:25.803 --> 48:28.567
Does this look familiar?

48:28.606 --> 48:31.541
From the magazine.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.406
This one's my favorite.

48:35.846 --> 48:37.507
It's about ambition.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.874
Did you ever hear
about the butterfly

48:41.919 --> 48:45.821
who fluttered its wings
in Tunisia

48:45.856 --> 48:49.485
and caused a tsunami
on the other side of the world?

48:49.527 --> 48:52.018
Yeah, I've heard that.

48:52.062 --> 48:54.997
Well, here's some
butterfly wings.

48:57.168 --> 48:58.829
Okay.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.074
All right.

49:21.058 --> 49:24.027
So yeah, just after the war,

49:24.061 --> 49:28.623
the Japanese artists embraced
the pop movement of the West,

49:28.666 --> 49:31.897
but then in the '70s,
they started reverting back

49:31.936 --> 49:35.064
to more traditional techniques,
like...

49:35.105 --> 49:36.800
Well, as if they were searching

49:36.841 --> 49:39.309
for some connection to the past

49:39.343 --> 49:42.710
that had been lost

49:42.746 --> 49:46.739
before, you know,
the whole world invaded.

49:48.452 --> 49:50.613
How do you know so much
about this stuff?

49:50.654 --> 49:54.055
Biography.

49:54.091 --> 49:55.752
And I studied art history.

49:55.793 --> 49:58.057
I...

49:58.095 --> 49:59.995
Studied painting for a bit,
but I wasn't any good,

50:00.030 --> 50:01.691
so I quit.

50:01.732 --> 50:05.429
Oh, I'm sure
that you were just fine.

50:05.469 --> 50:08.802
Well, that's what
my mother said.

50:08.839 --> 50:12.673
She wished that she could just
hang me up on walls.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.481
Well, why did you
stop painting?

50:17.515 --> 50:21.975
Well, I had a teacher,

50:22.019 --> 50:25.477
who said that
if you want to be an artist,

50:25.523 --> 50:28.651
you have to struggle,

50:28.692 --> 50:30.887
face criticism,

50:30.928 --> 50:34.523
knock on doors
for about ten years

50:34.565 --> 50:38.296
to know if you even had
any talent,

50:38.335 --> 50:40.803
and that's if talent
even existed.

50:40.838 --> 50:43.466
Maybe it was just persistence.

50:43.507 --> 50:47.375
So I decided to go into law.

50:47.411 --> 50:50.437
I think that's sad.

50:52.616 --> 50:55.710
It's good to know your strengths
and your limitations,

50:55.753 --> 50:57.311
'cause if you know
your limitations,

50:57.354 --> 51:00.118
then you can work within them.

51:00.157 --> 51:02.489
So juries love me.

51:04.295 --> 51:08.425
Yeah, I don't think I could
ever make a decision like that.

51:08.465 --> 51:11.457
Well, we make decisions
like that every day.

51:42.032 --> 51:44.330
So how do you feel?

51:44.368 --> 51:47.895
Like I've been out all night.

52:10.494 --> 52:12.359
Do you ever paint now?

52:12.396 --> 52:14.023
No, my clients would get angry

52:14.064 --> 52:16.032
if I did something like that.

52:16.066 --> 52:18.899
But you have time
for strip clubs

52:18.936 --> 52:21.769
and fancy parties and me.

52:21.805 --> 52:25.707
Yeah, well, you make time
for the important things.

52:30.814 --> 52:33.442
I want to see your paintings,

52:33.484 --> 52:36.317
your most recent ones.

52:38.055 --> 52:40.853
My most recent ones
are ten years old.

52:40.891 --> 52:44.383
Ten years ago, I was...

52:45.796 --> 52:48.128
In third grade, I think.

52:50.801 --> 52:54.737
Look at you now, all grown up.

53:32.509 --> 53:35.137
Where have you been?

53:35.179 --> 53:38.171
I met the nicest guy.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.994
Let me help you with that.

54:00.037 --> 54:02.733
Thank you.

54:02.773 --> 54:06.334
You ready to do this?

54:06.376 --> 54:08.003
I guess so.

54:08.045 --> 54:10.411
You guess?

54:10.447 --> 54:11.778
Yeah.

54:11.815 --> 54:13.373
Yeah, I'm ready.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.146
That's good.

54:15.185 --> 54:16.311
How does she look?

54:16.353 --> 54:18.878
- Hi.
- Beautiful.

54:18.922 --> 54:20.890
Is there a medical
professional in the building?

54:20.924 --> 54:22.221
I don't feel so good.

54:23.393 --> 54:25.224
Break her in gently.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.287
Do you do boy-girl?

54:27.331 --> 54:30.528
I haven't.

54:30.567 --> 54:31.693
I haven't decided yet.

54:31.735 --> 54:33.794
I'm all the man
she needs today.

54:33.837 --> 54:36.305
Come on, Cherry Pie,
let's go make a movie.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.671
Let's go.

55:00.197 --> 55:01.892
Hey, want some help?

55:01.932 --> 55:03.797
Yeah.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.933
Who's that?

55:07.971 --> 55:10.599
Oh, it's just a shoot someone
did for Girls Club today.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.768
That girl looks really young.

55:12.810 --> 55:14.175
She's legal.

55:14.211 --> 55:15.974
I think we're just
getting older.

55:16.013 --> 55:19.449
I didn't think
we're that much older.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.110
You don't have anything
to worry about.

55:21.151 --> 55:23.779
You look the same
as the day we met.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.846
You know, the thing I always
liked most about you

55:25.889 --> 55:27.322
was your honesty.

55:27.357 --> 55:28.847
Don't ruin that.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.725
Do you want a salad?

55:33.764 --> 55:36.528
Okay.

55:36.567 --> 55:40.697
You feel like heading
to the Four Leaf?

55:40.737 --> 55:42.034
I don't really want to hang out

55:42.072 --> 55:43.539
with your work friends.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.337
I got a closing first thing
in the morning

55:45.375 --> 55:47.343
in the China Basin.

55:47.377 --> 55:50.540
Yeah, I'm going to bed
with you or a magazine.

55:56.086 --> 55:58.020
Yeah, I stay here all the time.

55:58.055 --> 56:00.922
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:00.958 --> 56:03.085
Bourbon.

56:04.161 --> 56:05.628
Oh, no.

56:05.662 --> 56:06.993
What?

56:07.030 --> 56:08.327
When you're ordering bourbon,

56:08.365 --> 56:11.027
someone's pulling
at your heartstrings.

56:11.068 --> 56:12.160
I'm in a relationship.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.726
I think you know.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.302
This is San Francisco.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.331
That could mean anything.

56:20.277 --> 56:22.837
That's 'cause you're
a hot slut, but I'm loyal.

56:29.453 --> 56:33.184
I am not even going to say
anything, nope.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.463
That would be the first time.

56:34.491 --> 56:36.459
It would be.

56:36.493 --> 56:37.790
Her?

56:37.828 --> 56:40.058
What? No.

56:40.097 --> 56:42.065
- She's new.
- She's hot.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.862
She's hot.

56:45.636 --> 56:47.604
Oh, my gosh.

56:47.638 --> 56:48.832
What? It's nothing.

56:48.872 --> 56:50.772
It's nothing?

56:50.807 --> 56:52.866
Look at you.
You're totally blushing.

56:56.446 --> 56:57.435
Hey.

56:57.481 --> 56:59.381
I thought you'd be asleep.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.247
I thought I would be too.

57:10.394 --> 57:13.192
That wasn't even your shoot.

57:14.398 --> 57:17.128
The girl you were
looking at earlier.

57:17.167 --> 57:18.634
So?

57:18.669 --> 57:21.160
It wasn't even your site.

57:22.673 --> 57:23.970
People look at pictures.

57:24.007 --> 57:25.599
I wouldn't have a job
otherwise.

57:25.642 --> 57:28.440
That girl is a child.

57:28.478 --> 57:31.743
It's a job. It's my job.

57:43.260 --> 57:44.420
Eight years together,

57:44.461 --> 57:46.793
and this is all just starting
to dawn on you?

58:20.263 --> 58:21.855
So are we almost ready?

58:21.898 --> 58:23.729
Yeah, one second.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.427
Waiting on makeup.

58:26.470 --> 58:28.301
Makeup, you almost done?

58:28.338 --> 58:29.498
Makeup's clear.

58:29.539 --> 58:33.066
- Thanks.
- We're good.

58:33.110 --> 58:34.702
Do you want to start in wide?

58:34.745 --> 58:36.736
Maybe a little closer.

58:40.817 --> 58:43.809
Medium, waist up?

58:46.590 --> 58:49.582
I like a little closer
than that.

58:50.694 --> 58:51.820
That's good. That's good.

58:51.862 --> 58:52.886
Okay.

58:52.929 --> 58:54.794
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:54.831 --> 58:56.264
You're so beautiful.

58:57.401 --> 58:58.493
What's your name?

58:58.535 --> 59:00.002
I'm Vicki.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.868
Vicki, I hear you're married.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.566
How long have you been
with your husband?

59:03.607 --> 59:04.904
Since high school.

59:04.941 --> 59:08.001
You're childhood sweethearts.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.138
Does he still fuck you hard
every night?

59:10.180 --> 59:12.808
Oh, he's not that wild.

59:12.849 --> 59:16.148
Oh, that's such a shame.
You're so hot.

59:16.186 --> 59:17.787
Why don't you show us
what you like to do

59:17.821 --> 59:19.914
when your husband's not around?

59:25.695 --> 59:26.889
Okay, I'm sorry.

59:26.930 --> 59:29.421
I just need a second, okay?

59:33.003 --> 59:35.437
Is everything okay?

59:42.813 --> 59:43.939
Anyways...

59:43.980 --> 59:46.574
There's my baby girl.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.413
- Mom.
- Oh, returned to you at last.

59:48.452 --> 59:51.615
I didn't know that you were
coming to visit this weekend.

59:51.655 --> 59:52.815
Well, it's no problem,

59:52.856 --> 59:54.790
because this wonderful
little gentleman Paco

59:54.825 --> 59:57.316
has given me a beer and is
telling me a very funny story...

59:58.395 --> 59:59.384
That I cannot repeat.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.657
Good, good.

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:02.528
Good, great.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.625
Paco, where's Andrew?

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:05.965
He's still at the bookstore.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.129
He closes Thursdays now.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.570
Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.096
Say hello
to your long-lost sister.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.267
JoJo.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:14.800
Jo.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.836
Jo.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.939
So why are you all dolled up?

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.074
You got a hot date?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.482
"Hot" isn't halfway
to the truth.

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:23.918
That man can melt
an ice cream truck.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.285
No, okay.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:28.780
No, I was just trying out
some... some new fall trends.

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.622
You know, don't you read Cosmo?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.423
- I read Cosmo.
- I know.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.453
Well, if you got a hot date,
I want to meet him.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.693
Phyllis, he's a lawyer, even,
a catch.

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.065
I swear, I'm gonna turn him
when she's not looking.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.263
Yeah, well, they're all
a catch until they're caught.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:42.568
Honey, fix yourself up.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:43.800
Tell your hot lawyer

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.603
your mom wants to be taken out
on the town.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.203
Yeah, we didn't have plans
for today...

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.609
Move it, toots,

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.704
'cause we're not done talking
about you, anyway.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.476
Come on, move it.
I want to have some fun.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:55.007
Very funny.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.970
Hey, you okay?

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.038
There's a lot of snitches
around here.

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.999
Is there anything I can do
to help you right now?

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.710
Do you want some coffee or water
or an aspirin or anything?

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.445
No, okay?

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:05.079
Is there something wrong?
Are you losing money?

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.316
Okay,
I'll give you ten minutes.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.935
When's your boyfriend
getting here?

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:27.034
I don't know what happened.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.772
He was supposed to be here.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:31.440
Well, nothing unusual
about a man not showing up.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.813
That's why they call them men.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.408
No, he just...
he had some errands to run.

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.215
I'm sure he's gonna
be here soon.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:41.122
Well, we got all the time
in the world.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.387
You know, I'll just call him.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.451
I'll just call him real quick
and see where he is.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.097
Poor thing.

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.898
Paco, how's my little lady
doing?

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.871
She is the most popular girl
in town.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:56.997
Okay.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.974
Ambitious,
just like her mother.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.009
Soon, this town won't be
big enough for her either.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.578
I adore her.
She's a sweetheart.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.376
Yeah. You taking care of her?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:06.973
Oh, yeah, absolutely,
absolutely.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.678
All right.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.515
Okay, so he just...
he got caught up at work,

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:15.490
some last-minute documents.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.254
Lastminute?

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.421
He's going to trial this week,
you know,

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.089
so they had
to petition the court

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.100
for some sort of approval.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.814
I don't... I don't really know
what it means,

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:28.804
but he works a lot.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:29.930
Nope, no, no, no.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.372
No more for me, thanks.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:32.636
Really?

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:35.474
Yeah, I...
I know when to say when.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:37.878
I had a drink at your house,
and...

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.417
So you like this guy?

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.647
Is it that obvious?

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:47.316
Is he good to you?

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:48.949
Yeah.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.323
Yeah, he is.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.487
Remember Aunt Patty?

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:56.158
Remember how she used to always
work late at the car dealership?

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:58.793
Mom, why are you
bringing that up?

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.564
You know, nobody thought
anything of it.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.036
Nobody wondered why
a receptionist

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.540
was always working late
at a car dealership.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.906
Okay, but you haven't even
met Francis.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:09.036
I know. I know.
It just reminds me.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:10.376
He works late one time,

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.847
and you're implying
that he's a drug addict.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:16.443
The thing about Patty was,
she wouldn't call first.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:19.182
See, we'd all be sitting there
waiting for her at the bar.

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:21.690
Eventually,
some time would go by.

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.750
We'd realize,
"Patty's not here."

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:25.192
Now, this was before
cell phones,

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:26.752
so one of us would go call her.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.822
She'd say she was working late
at the car dealership.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:34.030
See, the thing about addicts is,
they don't call first.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.699
You have to remind them
to lie to you.

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:40.209
You think everybody
in this world is as fucked up

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.108
as the people in our family.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:45.474
Are you folks ready to order?

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:46.540
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm starving.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.346
Starving.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.910
I'm gonna have... Paco said
the meat loaf was good.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:54.617
I'm gonna have the...
$17 for meat loaf?

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.716
Well, isn't this fancy?

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.886
It's good. It's worth it.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.418
Thanks for dinner, Angel.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.760
It's no big deal.

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:03.925
Sorry about your boyfriend.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:05.264
- He has a name...
- Yeah, we all do.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.290
And you know it.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:07.826
We all do.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:09.168
You know,
you may not believe it,

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.730
but I know the mistakes,
'cause I've made them.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:13.743
See, he says
real nice things to you,

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:15.369
makes you feel special,

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.006
apologizes when he's done
something wrong,

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.674
but you've got
to keep your head,

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:22.014
because the next thing
he's gonna say is,

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.019
"I want to...
I want to take care of you,"

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.350
and it's just then

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.652
that he's gonna let you down
real hard.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.250
You know, Mom,
I don't think that that's true.

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:33.262
Well, there's true,
and there's true.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.355
You know, I really wish
you'd gone off with Andrew.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.423
You know, I think he would have
treated you real good.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:39.935
Boys and girls are allowed
to be friends with each other.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.459
Not in my lifetime.

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:42.904
- Oh, well...
- You know what, honey?

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.497
I think I'm gonna run in here
for a minute.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.668
I'm just gonna slip in here
real fast, okay?

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:47.989
I thought you were saying when.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:51.674
Well, I just...
can't hurt, okay?

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.773
Okay.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.910
I'm really glad you guys came.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.419
Me too.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.478
I missed you.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.853
Miss you so much.

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.161
My baby.

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.027
What's wrong with JoJo?

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.191
She can't talk anymore?

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:14.196
No.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.295
What?

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.000
Things have been hard.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.911
Po's not around, and...

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.708
She's not feeling well.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.346
What do you mean
she hasn't been feeling well?

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.681
Well...

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.187
I didn't know
if I should tell you that.

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.554
I didn't want
to ruin the visit.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.922
What?

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:37.620
Of course you should tell me.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.186
Of course you should tell me.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.131
She hasn't been feeling
too well.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.726
Her stomach's... she's okay,
and then she's not okay.

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:50.432
City General will only treat
people without insurance, so...

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:57.003
Is that... you need money?

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.807
Mom, you need to tell me
if you need money.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.512
Look, I can help.

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:04.747
I will.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.487
I'm so proud of you.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.495
I thought you were going
in the other direction.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.498
Here you are six months later.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.932
You're doing so great.

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.434
Mom, whatever she needs.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:22.927
Okay, anything that JoJo needs,
I'll... I'll get it for her.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:27.534
Don't tell her I told you.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.559
Hey.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.431
Hey, sorry I'm late for makeup.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.698
Everything's off schedule
today.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.398
Hey, Cherry.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.066
Don't worry.
They're gonna wait for you.

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:00.803
You're the most important thing
on that set.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.740
You know,
my real name is Angelina.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:07.147
Angelina.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.480
See you soon.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:11.009
Okay, I'll see you later.

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.920
Three girls? Okay

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:17.448
Margaret, glad you're here.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.893
We were just talking about the
live Canny Girl shoot coming up,

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.796
and we want to know
if the agencies will agree

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.026
to a day rate for the girls.

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.296
There's gonna be a lot
of improvisation.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.964
Well, I think that'd be
a tough sell.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:30.631
Come on, you think these girls

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.640
are counting blow jobs
on their fingers?

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:33.971
Well, I don't think

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.636
they're gonna do more
than what we pay them for.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.908
Whatever happened
to a baker's dozen?

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:40.581
What did happen
to a baker's dozen?

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.983
I don't know.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:48.050
Hey.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.557
What are you doing here?

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:57.794
I wanted to say
I'm sorry about dinner.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:01.861
Okay, well, you weren't
sorry enough to show up.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.667
Wait, look.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.698
Flowers.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:21.520
You know, my mom
doesn't believe that you exist.

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:26.221
I exist.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:29.390
I got to go.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.059
I'll call you later.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.158
Promise?

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.795
Yeah, I promise.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.099
Promise.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:37.697
I do.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.402
Go.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.785
Hey.

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:54.915
Where are you going?

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.720
We're heading out.

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.420
We're gonna...
we got an eight-hour drive.

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:00.190
We're gonna make
that appointment for JoJo.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:01.590
Oh, well,
I thought that you guys

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:04.065
were gonna stay
for the weekend.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.068
Well, we went out
while you were at your work,

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:07.729
your... that so-called job,
you know,

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.238
you don't want
to talk to us about?

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.241
Mom, I told you what my job is.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:15.267
Temping at
an accounting firm or something?

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:18.803
Right, with the funny dress code
and big salary?

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.179
Mom...

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.820
You know what?
This isn't a place for us.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.254
It's a place
for someone your age.

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:28.985
It's not a place for someone
my age or JoJo's age.

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:33.361
There's nothing wrong
with my stomach.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.100
What?

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.329
There's no operation.

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.997
My stomach's fine.

01:10:47.143 --> 01:10:48.974
Oh, God.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.074
Oh, Jo.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:56.144
Oh, Jo, I'm sorry.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.174
It's okay.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.313
I'm so sorry.

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:02.324
It's okay.
I'm gonna leave soon too.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.891
You need to finish
high school first.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:10.023
You didn't.

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:15.263
Okay.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.670
All right.

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:19.004
Come on, Jo, grab my nightgown.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.065
Let's go.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.406
Mom.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.344
- Mom!
- What?

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.459
You weren't even gonna tell me
that you were going?

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.449
Well, I guess we're the same
that way.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.472
Come on, Jo, let's go.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.645
Mom.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:31.846
Close the door, Jo.

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.555
Sure we've assembled
the best of the best.

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.757
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.790
I think so too.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.403
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.302
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.533
You've met Margaret before.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.804
I've been living
out of hotels so long,

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.003
I don't know who I've met.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.620
Sorry I'm late,
but one of the models

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.013
didn't show up
for the shoot today,

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.539
so we had to start later.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.676
Oh, are you a photographer?

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.776
No, I'm a film director.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.151
Oh, what kind?

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:06.678
Adult.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.417
And you had time to go home
and change,

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.721
or you wore this to work today?

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.489
I went and changed
for your party.

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.393
That's very interesting.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.898
I suppose that's like any kind
of film work?

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.423
Not really.

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.094
It's not really
that interesting.

01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:22.604
Well, I'm going to grab a wine

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.936
before they close the free bar.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:26.942
Can I get you guys anything?

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.068
No, thanks.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.572
Yeah, you just had to.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:35.049
He asked.

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.574
Yeah, and we'll just pretend.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:39.053
Like we haven't had
this conversation 500 times.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.893
So what's this party for,
anyway?

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:45.951
End of quarter reports.

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.828
My team is gonna win an award.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:55.393
I used to be on your team.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.599
Yeah, a long time ago.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.485
You just don't care about
what I do.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:20.654
Nobody cares about what you do.

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:25.699
Yeah, but making young girls
take off their clothes

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.498
so old guys have something
to wank off to

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.197
is a really noble job.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.672
No, I'd rather talk them into
buying homes they can't afford.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.607
What is the matter with you?

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:35.406
I hate these people.

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.435
Then you hate me.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.209
Why do you invite me
to these things?

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.579
Because you're my girlfriend.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:41.981
That's what
we're supposed to do.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:45.283
That's what people do
in the real world.

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:46.811
That's the contract.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.582
I didn't sign a contract.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.790
I don't want to be
like my parents.

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:56.127
You're like fucking Peter Pan.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.598
You don't want to not be
your parents.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.123
You just don't want to grow up.

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:09.802
I'm sorry.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.210
No, Margaret, you're not.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.147
You're not... no, no.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.843
You're not sorry.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.317
You want to be sorry?

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.217
I'll make you sorry.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:21.547
Yeah?

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.658
No, no, no.

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:29.187
Get down.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.787
Get down.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.967
Wait, stop.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:19.537
Give it to me.

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.495
I can see your whole world,

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.227
and it's so fucking small.

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.258
I loved you so much.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.970
You know the Dyke March
starts here next Saturday?

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.810
Somebody at work told me
it's, like, a sea of lesbians.

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.042
Sounds beautiful.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.744
You should come with me.
You can be my date.

01:15:55.785 --> 01:15:57.184
That would be different.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.582
Well, they're not gonna
eat you.

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:01.183
I don't think you're exactly
their type.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.020
Yo, you should've seen
that night, all right?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:06.517
Paco... they were aggressively
pursuing me.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.325
I... they wanted some Andrew.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.197
I mean,
I was the shit that night.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.860
Wait for me.
I can't move that fast.

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:13.891
Come on.

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.597
Your legs are longer.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:30.146
It's beautiful.

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:40.929
Think it's the most beautiful
city in the world?

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:42.954
Yeah.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.832
- See that building?
- What?

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:52.465
The building to the right
of the bridge.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.169
- Where? There?
- No, right to the right.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:55.234
- Yeah.
- The tall one?

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.642
- Yeah.
- That's where he lives.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.237
No.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.304
Fuck.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.509
Yeah, his apartment is amazing.

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.608
Bastard.

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.414
You should have seen him
in the morning.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.786
He got up, and he stood
at the edge of the bed

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:11.315
in his dress shirt...
no pants, just his dress shirt...

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.352
and he was grinding
coffee beans

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:18.332
with a hand-grinder for, like,
ten minutes at least.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.698
And then he left,
and he came back

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:22.363
with the most amazing
cup of coffee

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.099
I've ever had
in my entire life.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.545
That's not good.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:42.618
I'm thinking about doing
a guy-girl shoot.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.285
Why would you do that?

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.294
Well, you know,
I haven't done it yet,

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.693
and it pays a lot more.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.990
Do you need money?

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:56.867
Are you offering me
some of your bookstore salary?

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:02.373
No, I know it's a big deal.

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.708
I do. I just, you know...

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.805
I've been doing the girl stuff
for a while now,

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.043
so it's not really
that different.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:12.884
Boygirl is... is different.

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:15.618
The man cave...

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:24.257
I don't think you should do it,
you know?

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:27.121
Having?

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:29.653
The special.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.628
2 bucks.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:45.441
You a friend of Rafi?

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.506
Rafi who?

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.642
Just Rafi.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:51.448
What did he do for you?

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.455
Nothing.

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:54.649
Why are you looking for him

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:56.887
if he didn't do anything
for you?

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.893
I don't know anybody
with a name like that,

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.224
not even close.

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:01.729
Sorry for bugging you.

01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:03.561
No, you're not bugging me,
cowboy.

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.794
Put a dollar in.
Let's play a game?

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:08.200
Maybe I'm looking
for somebody too?

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.975
He's... he's looking for Rafi.

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.569
Forget about Rafi, man.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.137
Forget that shit.

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.239
Okay.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.147
I can hook you up
with a bundle.

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.812
No, just a dime.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.912
A little teaser?

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:28.547
All right.

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.887
Lay a note on the table.

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:35.190
Go somewhere else.

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.391
Look for somebody else.

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:00.152
Hey.

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:10.095
So, Cherry,
do you like to suck cock?

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:41.923
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:44.694
Francis, what happened?

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:51.171
And... action.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.280
I'm gonna fuck the shit
out of you.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:18.632
A little painkiller?

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.532
No, I'm okay.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.230
What, are you worried
about the guard?

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.704
He doesn't care.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:29.900
No, I just don't need
to be high to be with you.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:47.792
Why do you do...
why do you do what you do?

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.094
Francis, this is my job.

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:54.425
Well, maybe you should find
another job.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.938
Well, maybe you should have
kept making art.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:23:00.237
That's not...

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:02.106
Yeah, maybe.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.806
Why are you always high?

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.874
I don't know.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.551
I don't know.

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:15.682
It feels so good.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.821
Oh, fuck me!

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:28.202
How am I supposed
to fuck you tonight

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.797
after you
just got done fucking...

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.307
I don't know... five guys?

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.708
Okay, first of all, where did
you get "five guys" from?

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:36.938
Oh, sorry.

01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:38.708
Four? Six?

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.510
Really? 'Cause it was one.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:41.880
Okay.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:43.714
Oh, all right.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.310
Everybody's tested.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:47.962
Are all of your girlfriends
tested?

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.891
You're my only girlfriend.

01:23:50.926 --> 01:23:52.359
I don't have
any other girlfriends.

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.884
You're my only girlfriend.

01:23:53.929 --> 01:23:55.329
I'm not having sex
with anyone else.

01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:07.740
Your job is disgusting.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.680
What you do is disgusting.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:18.518
Okay.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.215
Really?

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.548
You disgust me.

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.592
I don't know what to say.

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:34.398
Yeah, it's fucking disgusting,

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.927
fucking disgusting.

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:37.961
Okay, hold on a sec.

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.286
Terra,
can you move it back here?

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:41.469
I want to get her whole body.

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:52.309
You okay?

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.389
Action.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.763
So you like to say
you do it for money.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.791
That's...
that's what the difference is?

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.133
Is that how you justify it?

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.296
Now, Chuck,
work towards the orgasm.

01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:15.037
You know, I thought
we were going somewhere.

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.105
We're not going anywhere.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.773
Great.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.158
Take me home.

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:44.130
That was hot.

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.230
Good job.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.937
Thank you.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.468
Thanks.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:04.359
Thank you.

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:06.520
Great. Once again, brilliant.

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.858
It was fun. It was good.

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.022
You were amazing, yeah.

01:26:09.064 --> 01:26:10.156
It felt good.

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.756
Just really good.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.789
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.609
Okay, thank you.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.036
Watch out!

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.344
You know, you're lucky

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:39.707
you ran into
one of these breakers

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:43.680
and not a carload of kids
down the street.

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:46.250
You sure you're okay?

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:48.023
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:49.325
Nothing happened to me.

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:50.661
Yeah, you're lucky, you know?

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:52.758
Your buddy over here
didn't look too well.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:54.359
Listen, he mentioned
something to me

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.632
about somebody stealing
his driver's license.

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.662
You know anything about that?

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.772
You know anything about it?

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.247
Looks like we found our thief.

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:17.157
Yeah, if you're not guilty,
then why are you so wet?

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.752
Lick it off.

01:28:24.566 --> 01:28:28.024
Maybe if you do a good job,
we'll go easy on you.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.401
Or maybe we'll put you
in the cage.

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:56.253
What the fuck?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.468
Are you jerking off?

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:03.930
No.

01:29:03.972 --> 01:29:05.963
No?

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.702
Okay.

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.539
No.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.139
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:15.639
I... I can't...
I can't share a bed with you.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.324
I don't even know...
I don't even know you.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.979
You know me better
than anybody, come on.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.079
No, I don't.

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.555
What the fuck, Ange?

01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:26.322
If you have something to say,
then you better say it.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.659
What?

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.255
I'm just supposed to sit here

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:33.358
while you run around
with everyone else?

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:34.527
I get it.

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:35.890
I'm just a...
I'm just a foreigner

01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:37.269
you keep around
to run your errands

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.068
and make you feel good
about yourself, right?

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.574
- That is not true.
- It is true.

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:42.133
- No, it's not.
- That is fucking true.

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:43.542
You treat me like a fucking pet.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:46.570
No, I don't!

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:48.446
You treat me like a pet.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:55.119
No, I don't.

01:30:00.929 --> 01:30:01.918
Come on.

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:03.084
Come on. What are you doing?

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:04.122
Wait, come on.

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:05.189
Stop it.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.325
What?

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:07.995
Every night,
I wait for you to come home

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:11.130
so we can hang out,
and you give me crumbs.

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.639
It's like
you're not even there.

01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:14.539
No, I am here.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:15.907
But you don't realize it,

01:30:15.944 --> 01:30:18.572
because the girl that
you're waiting for to come home

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.275
does not exist in real life.

01:30:21.316 --> 01:30:23.978
Okay, I'm not her.

01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:26.813
Why?

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:28.288
Why what?

01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:31.417
Why am I the only person
in the whole world

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:33.757
who's not allowed
to see you naked?

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:34.955
Why?

01:30:39.968 --> 01:30:43.233
You love me?

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.331
Do you love me?

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.365
Andrew, do you love me?

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.942
But not enough to jerk off
to somebody else.

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:11.161
♪ If you want to stay ♪

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:15.932
♪ You can
take what you want to ♪

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.962
♪ You can ♪

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:19.473
Hey.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.906
Hey.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.807
I'll have what she's having
and a shot.

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.778
Got it.

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:27.873
I had a boyfriend
who used to say that.

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:31.716
"I'll have what she's having
with whiskey in it."

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:34.187
I thought he was the coolest guy
in the world.

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:35.883
Probably was at the time.

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:41.123
I'm not usually
much of a drinker.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.993
Thanks.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.066
I think I might be
a bad person.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:57.772
You're not a bad person.

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:00.713
I think you're
a beautiful person.

01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:08.946
I got a letter
from my mom yesterday.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.624
She told me that
I let her down.

01:32:15.597 --> 01:32:16.757
Did you write her back?

01:32:16.798 --> 01:32:19.631
No.

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.635
No, but I will.

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.603
I just don't know when.

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:26.004
My parents think
I'm going straight to hell

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.601
because I had premarital sex.

01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:34.741
I have this cousin,
and she started working

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:37.047
at this laundromat
when she was 19,

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:38.450
right out of high school,

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:42.616
and no one wondered why
she worked at the laundromat.

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:45.592
She just did all this
boring shit.

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:47.925
I would visit her.
I couldn't stand it.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:49.623
It was, like,
her and the manager,

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:52.963
and there was no chance
of a promotion.

01:32:54.469 --> 01:32:56.767
And then she got married.

01:32:56.805 --> 01:32:58.272
Did she quit?

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.331
With what?
They don't have any money.

01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:03.538
She has a little boy,
and he plays Little League,

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.741
and he goes to public school.

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.214
I think she's still
working there.

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:10.183
It's, like, 12 years?

01:33:10.218 --> 01:33:13.153
$15 an hour.

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.651
Well, is she happy?

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.750
I don't know.

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.226
I don't think so.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.286
Okay.

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:26.292
What kind of story is that?

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.131
It's a real one.

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.693
That's a horrible story.

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.599
Yeah, I'm just...

01:33:37.479 --> 01:33:39.709
Trying to figure it out
on my own, you know?

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.237
Yeah.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:48.779
I just need somewhere to go

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:09.489
What you reading?

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.498
I want to plant some herbs
on our balcony.

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.466
Don't you think
that would be cool?

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:16.800
Like, basil and rosemary.

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:19.773
Sounds good to me.

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:22.401
This is amazing.

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.933
Yeah, I got it
at the farmers' market.

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:25.275

sometime.

01:36:25.313 --> 01:36:26.371

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:29.144
I like it
when you pick the fruit.

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:31.276
You always pick better fruit
than I do.

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:35.586
It's true.

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:38.185

01:36:39.694 --> 01:36:41.093
Do you have plans?

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.290

later today.

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:44.992

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:49.063
Okay. I got to get going.

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.730
I'm late.
I'll talk to you later.

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.541
So, Ebony, why do you want
to be a porn star?

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:06.883
I mean, I like doing it anyway.

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.218
You like doing what?

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:10.224

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:15.887
I do.

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.989
Do you like being watched?

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:20.057
Sometimes.

01:37:20.101 --> 01:37:22.729
Have you ever had anybody
watch you masturbate?

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:25.739
