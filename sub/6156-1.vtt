- May I be of service to you?
- Can I please speak to Mr. Gentry?

03:58.161 --> 03:59.500
Uh, why don't you try phoning?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.740
I've been trying all day, but no one answers.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.573
Why don't you try again tomorrow?

04:04.868 --> 04:06.864
- Try what?
- Phoning.

04:07.532 --> 04:09.289
But I'm here now.

04:09.723 --> 04:12.508
Thought you said you only wanted to
speak to him.

04:12.608 --> 04:16.646
Can I please see Mr. Gentry?

04:17.272 --> 04:22.289
Young lady, you've now had the pleasure of
both speaking to and seeing Mr. Gentry.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.560
- Now...
- You're Mr. Gentry?

04:24.787 --> 04:27.824
- I thought you were...
- His butler.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.734
Why, yes.

04:29.834 --> 04:33.509
One as efficient as myself
does not employ people to do tasks

04:33.609 --> 04:36.345
which he himself does superlatively.

04:36.445 --> 04:37.445
Gee.

04:38.126 --> 04:39.830
Well, are you going to invite me in?

04:40.574 --> 04:42.464
Do you have something to give me?

04:43.757 --> 04:46.718
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

04:48.552 --> 04:51.487
The concept seems worthy of consideration.

04:51.897 --> 04:53.986
Well, this is some place you've got here.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.219
May I have the pleasure of knowing
my welcomed intruder's name,

04:57.319 --> 04:59.033
and when I get the money?

04:59.133 --> 05:02.608
My name is Nancy Weston
and I'm a reporter for <i>The Globe.</i>

05:03.650 --> 05:05.250
Get out.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.538
Just a minute, Mr. Gentry.

05:08.739 --> 05:11.546
<i>The Globe</i> wants to hire you to investigate
that weird murder

05:11.646 --> 05:12.894
of the strip-teaser last night.

05:13.126 --> 05:16.154
Well, then, they can send me a formal letter
like anyone else.

05:16.254 --> 05:17.398
But we would have,

05:17.756 --> 05:21.630
but you have a reputation for giving lengthy
consideration before you take a case

05:21.885 --> 05:23.962
and we wanted to know your answer today.

05:25.088 --> 05:27.742
You mentioned $25,000...

05:27.842 --> 05:30.936
<i>The Globe</i> will give you $25,000
just to investigate the murder

05:31.134 --> 05:35.098
- and if you discover the murderer...
- If I discover the murderer?

05:36.225 --> 05:39.094
If you had any doubts at all,
why bother me?

05:39.194 --> 05:43.186
At any rate, discover the murderer
and you get $25,000 more.

05:43.447 --> 05:47.351
And your newspaper gets exclusive rights
to the mystifying story

05:47.451 --> 05:51.699
of how the remarkable Abraham Gentry
cracks another case.

05:51.956 --> 05:54.608
You took the words right out of my mouth.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.154
Tell me. Tell me.

05:56.314 --> 06:00.262
Anyone could have made me this offer,
the Editor, the Chairman of the Board,

06:00.631 --> 06:04.940
why such a young and attractive
novice reporter?

06:05.261 --> 06:08.727
Perhaps, your employers felt that $50,000
wasn't enough.

06:08.827 --> 06:13.057
Perhaps, but the money's the only offer
you're getting from me.

06:14.443 --> 06:15.629
I'm happy to know that.

06:15.729 --> 06:20.810
Because if anything were offered besides
the money, I would have had to turn it down.

06:22.610 --> 06:26.023
- If you're done being clever...
- Never.

06:27.608 --> 06:30.035
If I have your word
that you'll take this case,

06:30.160 --> 06:32.897
I'm authorized to give you this check
for $5000

06:32.997 --> 06:37.075
- for immediate expenses...
- You have my word and now you may leave.

06:38.076 --> 06:40.132
My pleasure.

06:41.997 --> 06:43.623
Stay out of trees.

07:37.384 --> 07:38.584
Hello.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.420
Hello!

07:43.092 --> 07:46.606
- Hey, mister.
- What in heaven's name can I do for you?

07:46.706 --> 07:50.294
- What can you do for me?
- Well?

07:50.640 --> 07:53.511
I just wanted to know
if you wanted something to drink.

07:54.155 --> 07:56.852
Oh, as a matter of fact, I am a bit dry.

07:56.952 --> 07:59.896
- I'll have some <i>Cordon Bleu.</i>
- Huh?

08:00.269 --> 08:03.735
<i>Cordon</i>... Never mind.

08:03.835 --> 08:05.588
I'll have a bottle of
tonic water.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.751
- In a clean glass.
- Ooh.

08:42.907 --> 08:45.656
Would you please sit and talk to me
for a while?

08:45.780 --> 08:47.067
Sure, babe.

08:51.082 --> 08:54.813
Sorry it took so long, but
we borrowed your glass as a bottle opener.

08:55.259 --> 08:58.204
Want me to take the first drink
to make sure it's OK?

09:00.466 --> 09:02.485
But I didn't boil my lips.

09:02.706 --> 09:04.935
- You should have.
- Eh, what gives?

09:05.104 --> 09:09.717
As a matter of fact I would appreciate it
if you'd let me take it off the tray.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.112
Sure, be my guest.

09:13.645 --> 09:16.148
Now, don't drink it too fast.

09:17.733 --> 09:21.665
Please tell me everything you can
about Suzie Creampuff.

09:21.911 --> 09:23.101
Are you a cop?

09:23.350 --> 09:25.490
- Hardly.
- But what do you wanna know for?

09:31.997 --> 09:34.435
She came from the Midwest.
She wanted to be an actress or a model.

09:34.535 --> 09:36.952
She was doing this for food till
she got a part in something.

09:37.052 --> 09:38.828
She worked here for about two months.

09:38.989 --> 09:41.810
She really thought she was something else,
but she was just a big tease.

09:41.973 --> 09:45.502
Oh, stop drooling.
I have a few more questions.

09:45.602 --> 09:48.319
- Shoot.
- Did she have any boyfriends?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.674
Nah, like I said, she was a big tease.

09:50.893 --> 09:54.260
She'd get all the horny guys really turned on
and let them think they were taking her home.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.763
But when the club closed, she'd tell them
all to flake off.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.951
Was there anyone she teased in particular?

10:00.859 --> 10:02.999
- Yeah.
- Go on.

10:03.099 --> 10:05.333
There was this one guy, uh, a student.

10:05.433 --> 10:06.905
Real wormy looking kid.

10:07.031 --> 10:09.702
His mouth started hanging open
as soon as he saw her.

10:09.958 --> 10:12.647
He didn't really pay any attention
to any of us other girls.

10:12.836 --> 10:15.197
He would have done anything just to get
it on with her.

10:15.297 --> 10:17.696
She'd always tease him and shut him down.

10:17.946 --> 10:20.140
Once, she told him
she'd spent a night with him.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.447
Do whatever he wanted for $200.

10:22.575 --> 10:24.185
So he came in the next night

10:24.285 --> 10:26.875
with a check made out to cash for $200

10:26.975 --> 10:28.758
and gave it to her after her last show.

10:28.858 --> 10:32.473
- And then?
- She looked at it, laughed and tore it up.

10:32.848 --> 10:35.515
- Hmm.
- Poor kid looked like he was gonna cry.

10:35.651 --> 10:37.311
Do you know what happened to that check?

10:38.312 --> 10:41.056
One of the bartenders saw the whole thing.
He felt sorry for the kid

10:41.156 --> 10:43.142
so he gave him a Harvey Wallbanger for it.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.389
Do you know where that check is?

10:45.702 --> 10:48.384
I think it's in the cash box, I'll check.

11:06.506 --> 11:07.506
Hmm.

11:08.258 --> 11:09.940
"Joseph Carter."

11:10.677 --> 11:12.762
"1138 Winona..."

11:13.972 --> 11:15.765
Is there anything else you can tell me?

11:16.891 --> 11:17.891
Nah.

11:22.772 --> 11:25.605
Hey, mister.
If you're ever around here again...

11:26.076 --> 11:28.154
I'll try not to be.

11:39.811 --> 11:42.458
I just thought I'd give you a little tip.

11:44.252 --> 11:47.172
A girl like you ought to know
what to do with this.

12:03.020 --> 12:06.787
Well, what are you doing here?

12:07.053 --> 12:09.818
Just making sure the paper's getting
its money's worth.

12:16.867 --> 12:21.166
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Where are we going?

12:22.414 --> 12:24.625
1138 Winona.

12:54.695 --> 12:57.595
Would you happen to be a Mr. Joseph Carter?

12:59.033 --> 13:01.778
Nah, man, you like, uh, just missed him.

13:03.412 --> 13:05.331
Would you happen to know where he went?

13:07.124 --> 13:08.626
Who are you?

13:14.127 --> 13:18.669
Yeah, yeah, he went to the stripper's.
Candy Cane's.

13:18.829 --> 13:22.690
She was this friend of the other stripper
that got bumped off the other night.

13:22.940 --> 13:26.936
- Did he say why he went?
- Why do you wanna know?

13:31.774 --> 13:36.574
Uh, he said something about,
uh, he thought she knew something.

13:36.744 --> 13:41.107
Man, he was like real crazy, man,
freaked out, like in a daze.

13:41.207 --> 13:43.751
Haven't been out of his crib all day.

13:44.168 --> 13:47.736
Did he say where the young lady lived?

13:48.206 --> 13:49.206
Yeah.

13:53.753 --> 13:58.501
Uh, it's like first pan above Hungry Man's
restaurant, like right down there.

14:00.677 --> 14:03.430
Eh, thanks a lot, man. Peace!

17:08.494 --> 17:11.280
- Who do you think you'll find here?
- Kilroy.

18:20.473 --> 18:22.369
Why did you do that?

18:22.754 --> 18:25.933
I didn't think you'd want to be
on the floor when the police arrive.

18:26.354 --> 18:28.878
They wouldn't step over you.

18:43.133 --> 18:44.706
Lieutenant Anderson, please.

18:46.374 --> 18:50.013
No. No emergency.

18:55.557 --> 18:57.141
Lieutenant Anderson,

18:57.642 --> 19:03.473
a friend of mine stepped into some trouble
and seems to have lost face.

19:37.257 --> 19:39.668
All right, stop taking
those goddamn pictures!

19:39.768 --> 19:41.595
Or I'll arrest every one of you.

19:45.598 --> 19:46.974
Now look, Gentry.

19:47.850 --> 19:51.854
Happen to know anything else, or have you
found anything and forgot to tell me?

19:53.690 --> 19:54.690
Lieutenant...

19:56.982 --> 19:59.284
I'm sorry, I cannot stay for your pardon.

19:59.474 --> 20:01.614
But I have some things to attend to.

20:21.904 --> 20:24.714
Hey, don't you think that guy, Carter, has
anything to do with the murders?

20:24.814 --> 20:26.839
Hardly. A diversionary tactic.

20:26.939 --> 20:28.966
- How do you figure?
- Miss Weston,

20:29.066 --> 20:34.055
I'm not here to instruct you on
criminal investigations or ingenious methods.

20:41.611 --> 20:43.039
Well, where to, then?

20:45.281 --> 20:46.999
How about your apartment?

20:47.519 --> 20:50.884
Why, Abraham, you're flattering me.

20:51.305 --> 20:55.542
Yes, I was thinking of putting you to bed.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.424
And giving you an adequate dose of sleeping
pills to get rid of you for a few days.

21:04.509 --> 21:07.887
Tell me, Mr. Gentry, do you try to be a jerk
or does it just...

21:07.987 --> 21:09.322
Come naturally.

21:09.543 --> 21:11.683
Get in and fasten your seat belt.

21:15.353 --> 21:18.009
- Where to?
- Tops and Bottoms.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.944
The place where our friend worked
who had her face lifted.

24:19.533 --> 24:22.855
You're resting
your crutch on my foot.

24:23.066 --> 24:25.802
I don't want you
to move an inch from this spot.

24:25.902 --> 24:27.531
Oh, no. Ow!

24:27.631 --> 24:29.190
OK, OK.

24:31.211 --> 24:32.556
Where are you going?

24:33.117 --> 24:35.549
Going to pay a small visit to the bartender.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.842
How would you like a drink while I'm gone?

24:46.852 --> 24:52.973
Hey, Barney, give me a couple of Martinis
and a Manhattan on the rocks, please.

24:53.221 --> 24:56.820
- Right with you. Yeah.
- Now. Yeah, yeah.

24:58.146 --> 25:00.423
All I ever do around this place is wait.

25:00.748 --> 25:02.075
Come on.

25:03.576 --> 25:05.447
Hey, she's taking it all off!

25:11.751 --> 25:13.168
Excuse me.

25:14.851 --> 25:17.331
Sorry, you are inexcusable.

25:17.431 --> 25:19.702
Well, if it isn't Miss Glamour.

25:19.830 --> 25:22.474
If I would have known
you were coming, Mr. Clean,

25:22.687 --> 25:27.571
I would have bought a bottle of Pepto-Bismol
for you and a bottle of disinfectant for me.

25:28.141 --> 25:31.104
It never occurred to me that
I might run into you after your work

25:31.229 --> 25:32.645
twice in one day.

25:32.745 --> 25:36.309
But, if it did, I would have thought
your second job would have caused me

25:36.409 --> 25:38.337
to bump into you on the street.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.250
Look. What do you want? I'm busy.

25:40.350 --> 25:43.015
I don't wanna get fired
for talking to riff raff.

25:43.186 --> 25:46.694
The young lady at that table
would like a Zombie in a tall glass

25:46.794 --> 25:48.756
with four shots of tequila.

25:48.963 --> 25:50.736
How long has she been out with you?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.642
Just deliver the drink.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.686
- Hey, Barney.
- Yeah.

25:56.032 --> 26:00.540
I want a Zombie in a tall glass
with four shots of tequila.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.009
Don't ask me why.

26:34.082 --> 26:35.972
- Hey, Barney.
- Yeah.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.748
- I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- I'm too busy, Max.

26:49.346 --> 26:54.018
Hey, Charlie, take over for me.
I gotta take a shit.

27:01.192 --> 27:03.819
Yeah, buddy, what's on your mind?

27:05.196 --> 27:07.606
Who's that big man at the end of the bar,

27:07.706 --> 27:10.359
the one mutilating those squashes
and tomatoes?

27:10.525 --> 27:12.536
Oh, him, he's Grout.

27:13.496 --> 27:16.365
- Grout?
- Yeah, Grout.

27:16.539 --> 27:18.918
That's all I've ever heard him called.

27:20.294 --> 27:23.716
Hey, uh, why are you interested in him?

27:23.847 --> 27:26.438
Please tell me everything you can about him.

27:27.017 --> 27:29.417
Yeah, buddy.

27:30.145 --> 27:33.298
Now, uh, you know,
I don't know much about him,

27:33.467 --> 27:35.968
like, where he lives and stuff like that

27:36.068 --> 27:38.664
but what I do know is that he's an ex-Marine

27:38.820 --> 27:41.213
and he spent a lot of time in Vietnam.

27:41.405 --> 27:44.629
Now, he was really crazy.

27:45.076 --> 27:46.559
You know what he used to do?

27:46.786 --> 27:50.898
He hated them gooks so much
that he used to go through the rice paddies

27:50.998 --> 27:55.765
after the battles were over and he'd start
busting in the heads of the dead bodies.

27:56.788 --> 27:58.785
Well, they didn't bother him much, you know.

27:59.006 --> 28:02.571
Till they found out he wasn't just busting
in the heads of the gooks.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.096
Well, our boys too!

28:05.516 --> 28:07.421
Hmm, did they discharge him?

28:07.521 --> 28:08.783
Hell no!

28:09.055 --> 28:11.010
Why'd they do that?

28:13.287 --> 28:14.772
And then, what?

28:15.932 --> 28:20.464
He came here, got a job.
Keeps pretty much to himself.

28:20.770 --> 28:23.508
What about the squashes and tomatoes?

28:23.802 --> 28:28.359
Oh, that, he says he
does it to relieve tension,

28:28.619 --> 28:32.823
and bring back fond memories.

28:36.285 --> 28:38.011
What time did he come in tonight?

28:38.191 --> 28:40.080
About an hour ago.

28:40.931 --> 28:42.367
Thank you very much, Barney.

28:42.713 --> 28:45.312
Sure, buddy, anytime.

28:46.587 --> 28:48.997
Hey, Barney,
you done with that shit, yet?

28:49.097 --> 28:50.097
Yeah!

29:02.978 --> 29:04.888
How is my lovely partner doing?

29:05.071 --> 29:09.526
Oh, they sure make
a great drink at this joint.

29:11.966 --> 29:16.867
Abraham, you called me your partner.

29:17.326 --> 29:18.920
Did you mean it?

29:19.291 --> 29:21.996
Do I ever say anything I don't mean?

29:28.336 --> 29:30.552
I have one more person to see.

29:31.013 --> 29:32.773
How would you like another drink,
while I'm gone?

29:32.873 --> 29:36.344
Are you trying to get me drunk now to
take advantage of me later?

29:37.595 --> 29:43.545
Well, you don't have to get
me drunk to do that.

29:45.519 --> 29:46.854
I know.

29:48.074 --> 29:49.460
Waitress.

29:51.984 --> 29:53.769
I was afraid it was your voice.

29:53.869 --> 29:56.781
My charming companion
would like another, of the same.

30:02.662 --> 30:05.039
See you later, Abie.

30:07.477 --> 30:10.378
No, I'm afraid not.

30:15.715 --> 30:19.085
Hey, Grout, I wish you wouldn't be so messy.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.185
Mr...

30:23.056 --> 30:24.503
Mr. Grout.

30:26.184 --> 30:27.727
Hey, all right.

30:29.478 --> 30:32.765
Ladies and gentleman,
the Tops and Bottoms club

30:32.865 --> 30:37.478
proudly presents another of our most
beautiful and voluptuous young maidens,

30:37.578 --> 30:40.031
Miss Lola Prize.

30:51.554 --> 30:53.753
- What's going on, Mary?
- Shh.

32:11.496 --> 32:12.497
Mr. Grout?

32:14.707 --> 32:17.293
All right, girls, just get on stage.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.496
As soon as she goes into her act,
we'll go into ours.

32:20.596 --> 32:21.596
Yeah!

32:21.964 --> 32:25.981
We'll show these striptease bitches
just what we think!

32:26.081 --> 32:27.441
Yeah!

32:27.627 --> 32:30.890
If we don't rip her hair out.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.581
Yeah!

34:06.744 --> 34:07.957
Mr. Grout!

34:09.541 --> 34:12.907
Why do you keep on bothering me?

34:19.163 --> 34:20.925
Let's go!

34:23.167 --> 34:25.293
Hey, folks, get outta here.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.775
Mr. Grout, please accept my apology,

34:36.876 --> 34:38.797
but I just thought I would tell you that

34:38.898 --> 34:42.643
the police already know about
Miss Candy Cane's murder tonight.

36:04.641 --> 36:05.809
Get out of here!

36:08.562 --> 36:10.731
Get 'em, girls! Get 'em!

36:17.218 --> 36:19.248
Hi, Abie.

36:19.998 --> 36:23.409
- Time to go home, Nancy.
- Oh, good!

36:25.661 --> 36:27.580
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, oh.

37:21.758 --> 37:22.758
Taxi!

37:31.893 --> 37:33.353
Come with me.

37:45.867 --> 37:49.160
I want you to take the young lady home.
Stick out your hands.

37:52.831 --> 37:55.667
Here is her address and this is her key.

37:58.128 --> 37:59.546
Keep the change.

38:37.583 --> 38:41.086
Hey, you haven't told me your name yet.

38:41.211 --> 38:42.962
Abraham Gentry.

38:43.138 --> 38:46.383
- You mean...
- The Abraham Gentry.

38:47.301 --> 38:48.301
Abie.

38:50.053 --> 38:51.472
Pickles.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.256
Do you mind if I lie down?

38:53.356 --> 38:55.385
I'm still pretty shook up.

38:55.851 --> 38:58.562
Do you know a Miss Candy Cane?

39:00.689 --> 39:03.891
Sure. She strips at the same joint I do.

39:03.991 --> 39:06.844
She didn't come in tonight.
Funny, you should bring her up.

39:07.036 --> 39:08.552
Nothing can bring her up.

39:08.767 --> 39:11.378
She was murdered tonight.

39:11.478 --> 39:13.275
Oh, my God.

39:13.375 --> 39:15.531
Well, who could have killed her?

39:15.711 --> 39:20.802
That's what I'm trying to find out.
And I think you might be able to help.

39:21.321 --> 39:25.405
That's the second of my friends that've
been killed in the last couple of days.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.831
You know Miss Suzie Creampuff too?

39:28.257 --> 39:30.960
Well, not real good,
but Candy was good friends with her

39:31.060 --> 39:33.102
and I was good friends with Candy.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.056
I still can't believe it.

39:35.181 --> 39:37.675
- She was so sweet.
- Hmm.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.997
Are you familiar with a young man named
Joseph Carter?

39:41.418 --> 39:43.422
I just met him tonight.

39:44.065 --> 39:47.226
He wanted to see Candy to talk
to her about Suzie,

39:47.326 --> 39:51.823
but he was too shy to go to her apartment
so he came to work to wait for her.

39:51.948 --> 39:55.921
Now, he'll never get to meet her.
I just can't believe it.

39:56.021 --> 39:59.154
Do you know whether she or Suzie
knew Grout?

39:59.311 --> 40:01.291
Sure, we all know him.

40:01.623 --> 40:05.028
He scares me, the way he's always
staring at my head.

40:05.197 --> 40:07.433
But he does protect me from mashers.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.372
Mashers, yes.

40:09.472 --> 40:13.426
What about, uh, the leader of that
women's group that attacked you tonight?

40:13.635 --> 40:17.897
That bitch. She's always causing trouble
around the clubs.

40:18.064 --> 40:22.153
She says, "You strippers
is a disgrace to womanhood."

40:22.360 --> 40:26.509
Has she ever threatened to kill
any of you before tonight?

40:27.011 --> 40:28.558
All the time.

40:28.658 --> 40:32.399
- We get... of the Marzdone...
- Marzdone? Mobilie?

40:32.737 --> 40:36.508
Yeah, do you know him?
He's the owner of all these clubs.

40:36.749 --> 40:38.042
Quite well.

40:38.355 --> 40:40.862
Anyway, he says that if we did,

40:40.962 --> 40:44.374
publicity will just bring more of
them together and make things worse.

40:45.250 --> 40:48.535
Until tonight, they just picketed and ran off
with the mail.

40:48.635 --> 40:50.754
Tore off a couple of our costumes.

40:55.634 --> 40:59.755
Oh, yeah, one night, she came in the club,

40:59.855 --> 41:02.111
took off her bra on stage.

41:02.211 --> 41:04.993
Well, Candy grabbed it out of her hands
and put it on.

41:05.193 --> 41:09.982
It was real funny coz Candy is five
or six times bigger than she is.

41:10.357 --> 41:11.984
Thank you very much, Lola.

41:12.443 --> 41:14.521
You've been a big help to me.

41:16.822 --> 41:21.869
Well, aren't you gonna stay
for a cup of coffee or something?

41:23.078 --> 41:25.572
Well, uh, I have to get a little rest.

41:25.732 --> 41:28.974
But you can rest. Here.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.589
He was kinda cute.

42:08.414 --> 42:10.057
What are you doing here?

45:22.723 --> 45:24.148
Ah, Gentry.

45:27.776 --> 45:29.444
All right, stop it!

45:36.854 --> 45:40.363
OK, Gentry, what did you
and Miss Prize talk about?

45:40.463 --> 45:42.943
Uh, Lieutenant, have you figured out
that I left prior to the killing?

45:43.043 --> 45:45.442
Yeah. Yeah, just tell me
what you talked about.

45:45.698 --> 45:49.173
I take it that the cause of death
was exactly like the others.

45:49.352 --> 45:51.666
Uh... Face mutilated with a meat tenderizer.

45:51.766 --> 45:54.252
Throat slit and this one had her ass beat in.

45:54.599 --> 45:56.826
Tell me what you talked about!

46:07.857 --> 46:08.857
Um...

46:13.154 --> 46:16.848
Hey, look, Gentry, you're trying my patience,
now, if you don't start co-operating...

46:16.948 --> 46:18.432
- Things.
- Huh?

46:18.784 --> 46:20.560
We talked about things.

46:20.732 --> 46:22.763
Am I gonna have to take you
down to the station?

46:22.963 --> 46:26.228
How original. All right, Lieutenant.

46:26.529 --> 46:30.176
I took Miss Prize home after an incident
with some women's liberationists.

46:30.276 --> 46:31.276
Yeah.

46:31.576 --> 46:34.875
I questioned her about why she felt
the women had attacked her?

46:34.975 --> 46:35.975
Yeah.

46:36.636 --> 46:42.445
Let's see, oh, yes, and she removed
every stitch she had on.

46:42.545 --> 46:45.886
Began explaining how the other
women were jealous of her body...

46:45.986 --> 46:48.347
Oh, and then she pointed out
a few of the high spots.

46:48.447 --> 46:49.765
Yeah, then.

46:49.865 --> 46:51.767
Oh, yeah, she propositioned me.

46:51.867 --> 46:53.236
Yeah, yeah.

46:53.361 --> 46:54.666
Well, go ahead. What'd you do then?

46:54.766 --> 46:59.628
Oh, Lieutenant, have you no respect for
the privacy of one's intimate relations,

46:59.728 --> 47:01.660
let alone the dead?

47:01.785 --> 47:03.007
Now, look, Gentry,

47:03.107 --> 47:06.030
when it comes to law and order,
it's my duty and responsibility

47:06.130 --> 47:07.434
to find out everything.

47:07.707 --> 47:10.057
You act as if I get pleasure out of this.

47:10.447 --> 47:11.711
Now, what did you do then?

47:12.582 --> 47:15.650
Well, I explained to this poor lost soul

47:15.953 --> 47:20.295
how she would find much more pleasure
and satisfaction in the teachings of God

47:20.395 --> 47:25.100
than any encounter with me,
and I left her reading her Bible.

47:25.642 --> 47:29.145
OK, wise guy.
If that's true, where's the Bible?

47:29.938 --> 47:34.205
Lieutenant, how brilliant. You've uncovered
something I never thought of.

47:34.305 --> 47:36.040
The murderer is a religious fanatic

47:36.140 --> 47:39.043
who is ridding the world of
these unscrupulous harlots.

47:39.143 --> 47:40.169
Yeah, I got it.

47:40.269 --> 47:41.941
That person wouldn't leave her with the Bible.

47:42.041 --> 47:43.505
- So the murderer took it.
- Right.

47:43.605 --> 47:46.121
You find that Bible
and you've got yourself a killer.

47:46.246 --> 47:49.385
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Gentry.

47:49.485 --> 47:53.836
- Don't thank me, you did all the work.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!

47:54.878 --> 47:56.683
All right, men, we gotta find the Bible.

47:56.783 --> 47:57.783
- Why?
- What?

47:57.883 --> 47:59.181
Now!

48:01.302 --> 48:03.095
- I just...
- Uh, Lieutenant.

48:03.554 --> 48:04.859
Yeah, what do you want, Gentry?

48:04.959 --> 48:09.750
You mentioned something about Miss Prize's
hind end being pulverized?

48:10.102 --> 48:12.242
I haven't discovered the reason why, yet,

48:12.342 --> 48:15.098
but when we found her she was on her back,
with her...

48:15.198 --> 48:17.109
Her panties pulled down to her knees.

48:17.234 --> 48:18.777
And when we turned her over, her...

48:19.778 --> 48:24.203
Uh, her... The lady's, uh, fanny was smashed.

48:24.575 --> 48:27.995
There was no apparent reason for it,
but we did find this next to it.

48:31.281 --> 48:33.292
- I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Yeah.

48:33.417 --> 48:36.083
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Gentry.

48:45.136 --> 48:46.304
Oh, Freddy...

48:49.057 --> 48:53.073
- How's the wife and kids?
- Oh, we're all fine, Mr. Gentry. And you?

48:53.173 --> 48:54.470
Couldn't be better.

48:54.570 --> 48:59.934
Freddy, I'd like you to take what's in this
piece of paper and on that handkerchief

49:00.034 --> 49:02.687
and have the boys in the lab give me
everything they can on it.

49:02.787 --> 49:06.944
Needless to say, we don't want,
you know who, to find out about it.

49:07.124 --> 49:10.611
Oh, buy the boys some good cigars.

49:10.711 --> 49:13.623
Sure enough, Mr. Gentry,
I'll take care of everything.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.586
- Good night, Freddy.
- Anytime, Mr. Gentry.

51:51.991 --> 51:53.488
Linda, I'm home.

53:02.055 --> 53:04.554
Girls! Girls!

53:04.732 --> 53:05.964
Girls!

53:14.233 --> 53:15.476
What's the matter?

53:15.576 --> 53:17.165
What's the matter?

53:17.265 --> 53:18.571
What's going on?

53:20.368 --> 53:22.608
What happened? What's going on here?

53:22.708 --> 53:25.069
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, let me help.

53:25.689 --> 53:28.664
What is wrong? What is wrong?

53:29.302 --> 53:31.208
What's the matter?

53:32.585 --> 53:33.806
What's the matter?

53:47.269 --> 53:48.601
Find anything?

53:48.726 --> 53:51.551
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
- Well...

53:51.771 --> 53:53.430
Oh, now look, Gentry.

53:53.530 --> 53:57.886
You don't expect me to tell you about
confidential police evidence, do you?

53:58.076 --> 54:00.945
Anyway, if you've found something,
you wouldn't tell me.

54:01.112 --> 54:02.906
Lieutenant...

54:05.784 --> 54:10.955
Must I remind you of that brilliant
religious theory that you came up with?

54:15.285 --> 54:17.710
Well, no, but that was proved wrong already.

54:18.033 --> 54:20.382
Lieutenant, I'm surprised at you.

54:24.636 --> 54:27.714
Are you going to stand there and tell me that
just because you've found

54:27.814 --> 54:30.738
that obviously planted Bible
in unavoidable sight,

54:30.838 --> 54:37.187
that you're going to disregard a theory
that your own genius so cleverly devised?

54:37.615 --> 54:41.152
- Now, are you?
- That obviously planted Bible.

54:42.112 --> 54:45.824
I don't know about you,
but it's perfectly clear to me that

54:46.061 --> 54:52.284
the girl's Bible was taken by the murderer
and that one left to mislead the authorities.

54:52.413 --> 54:54.761
Well, no, I mean, yeah.

54:54.861 --> 54:57.096
Of course, of course I realize that.

54:57.196 --> 54:59.807
I just wanted to see if you're as smart
as you're cracked up to be.

55:00.241 --> 55:02.257
I guess we can show you what we've found.

55:02.431 --> 55:04.750
Since it has no real bearing
on the case anyway,

55:04.850 --> 55:06.316
That is, if you'd wanna bother.

55:06.476 --> 55:09.905
Another one of these things.
Found it on the floor in the kitchen.

55:10.272 --> 55:12.280
Hey, what do you make of that girl's chest?

55:12.691 --> 55:15.018
Not very much at the moment.

55:15.419 --> 55:18.121
That must be why the murderer used
heat in these killings.

55:18.339 --> 55:21.458
To give the girls a taste of their destiny?

55:21.558 --> 55:22.626
Well, sure.

55:22.726 --> 55:24.899
The madman must have figured
to burn them some here

55:24.999 --> 55:26.555
before they got down there.

55:27.514 --> 55:29.433
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

55:31.673 --> 55:32.673
Doc.

55:34.579 --> 55:35.631
Doc.

55:35.841 --> 55:37.683
Oh, hello, Mr. Gentry.

55:37.783 --> 55:43.018
Doc, are there any differences in the murders,
aside from the different means of mutilation?

55:43.204 --> 55:48.213
No, but I'll tell you one thing.
This murderer sure wasn't weak.

55:48.725 --> 55:49.725
Hmm.

55:50.962 --> 55:54.279
Thank you, Doc. Nancy...

55:54.724 --> 55:57.451
- It's time for you to do something useful.
- What?

55:57.743 --> 56:00.687
I want you to find the leader of
that women's lib gang,

56:00.787 --> 56:02.049
Mary McHenry.

56:02.322 --> 56:06.430
Somehow find out how strong she is
and if she wears any makeup.

56:07.303 --> 56:12.049
And then, I want you to
act sympathetic to her cause,

56:12.149 --> 56:15.636
tell her you're writing a story about
her feelings about the murders.

56:15.841 --> 56:19.315
And to play it safe,
you better take off your bra.

56:19.440 --> 56:20.692
Anything else?

56:21.526 --> 56:26.204
Yes, find out if she wore a wig and if so
get me all you can on it.

56:26.414 --> 56:29.991
And then check out Miss Prize's apartment.
See if she wore a wig.

56:30.213 --> 56:33.059
- And if so, get me samples.
- Where are you going?

56:33.480 --> 56:37.407
I'm going to visit the owner of all
those clubs where the girls worked,

56:37.507 --> 56:39.418
Mr. Marzdone Mobilie.

57:02.691 --> 57:05.826
Hey, fellas, I got a really great idea.

57:05.952 --> 57:07.863
How about an amateur strip contest?

57:07.988 --> 57:11.766
I'll put a sign in all our places saying,
"So you wanna be a stripper?

57:11.916 --> 57:15.701
"Amateur strip contest. Come one, come all.

57:15.825 --> 57:17.384
"Big prize!"

57:17.631 --> 57:19.878
- Hey, you know what the prize is gonna be?
- What's that, boss?

57:19.978 --> 57:20.978
Me.

57:23.211 --> 57:25.810
Well, what's the prize really gonna be, boss?

57:25.910 --> 57:28.719
Uh, how about 200 bucks?
Do you think that's enough?

57:29.139 --> 57:30.259
I don't know, boss.

57:30.451 --> 57:31.552
Come here, baby.

57:32.678 --> 57:35.193
Do you think $200
is really a big enough prize?

57:35.376 --> 57:36.465
For what?

57:36.565 --> 57:40.323
- About the prize. 200 bucks. Any, uh...
- For what?

57:40.423 --> 57:42.775
Oh, take a walk.
I'll call you when I need you.

57:43.022 --> 57:46.496
Hey, fellas, maybe I ought to give
300 bucks as the prize.

57:46.596 --> 57:47.735
Mr. Mobilie?

57:47.860 --> 57:51.660
Hey, buddy, can you read the sign back there?
It says, closed till 5:00. Beat it.

57:51.997 --> 57:54.504
Hey, maybe I ought to throw in a...

57:54.604 --> 57:56.819
Like the George Washington monument.

57:56.919 --> 57:58.491
Yeah, boss. Yeah.

57:58.986 --> 58:00.322
Mr. Mobilie.

58:00.652 --> 58:02.082
Gentry! Fred, Sam!

58:07.588 --> 58:10.271
Nice going, Gentry. They deserved that.

58:10.453 --> 58:13.612
I would have done it myself,
only I didn't have the heart to do it.

58:13.894 --> 58:15.262
Sit down for a minute.

58:16.263 --> 58:18.438
I want you to know, I don't bear any grudges.

58:23.770 --> 58:25.541
Well, do me a favor, will you, Gentry?

58:25.780 --> 58:29.154
Stop investigating my places.
I've got enough problems.

58:29.346 --> 58:33.213
You know, I just found out this morning
that two more of my girls were bumped off.

58:33.371 --> 58:35.043
And the rest of the girls are...

58:35.143 --> 58:37.867
Nobody'll be here tonight,
they even have...

58:38.993 --> 58:40.829
What about the waitress over there?

58:41.955 --> 58:45.513
She hasn't got
the chest for anything. No tits.

58:45.800 --> 58:48.606
I'm trying to get some amateur strippers here.
I'm desperate.

58:48.928 --> 58:51.155
Say, by the way, what are you investigating?

58:51.722 --> 58:54.620
Ironically, in a way, I'm working for you.

58:55.059 --> 58:59.001
I'm investigating the murders of your now
thoroughly exotic dancers.

59:00.223 --> 59:02.946
- No...
- Very little, if any.

59:03.046 --> 59:05.240
Hey, boss, can we go home?
I don't feel so good.

59:05.340 --> 59:07.138
Yeah, go ahead
and don't forget to be back by 5:00

59:07.238 --> 59:09.274
- and bring your other head.
- Yeah, boss.

59:09.941 --> 59:11.234
Are you a cop?

59:11.985 --> 59:17.239
I informed you that my services are indirectly
awarded to you and you keep insulting me.

59:18.740 --> 59:20.755
When was the last time you saw Grout?

59:21.084 --> 59:22.784
Oh, he was around a little while ago.

59:23.024 --> 59:26.942
Personally, I think he left
for warmer climates. Dig?

59:27.124 --> 59:29.664
Do you think it was because of the murders?

59:30.168 --> 59:33.055
No, around here kept running out of squash.

59:33.534 --> 59:35.415
Do you know he's a damn good bartender?

59:35.515 --> 59:36.875
And besides, he kept

59:36.975 --> 59:39.118
- the mashers away from the broads.
- The mashers away from the broads.

59:40.762 --> 59:42.855
Do you have any feelings about the murders?

59:43.015 --> 59:46.894
Oh, buddy, I got a big hurt,
right here in my heart.

59:47.087 --> 59:50.493
Listen, if you're gonna do business with him,
I'm gonna quit.

59:50.593 --> 59:52.630
Listen, you mind your own business.

59:53.054 --> 59:56.895
- You know who this is?
- Yeah, I know exactly who and what this is.

59:56.995 --> 59:59.272
Marlene and I have had what you might say

59:59.372 --> 01:00:01.733
the mutual displeasure
of each other's acquaintance,

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:04.312
uh, several times in the past few days.

01:00:04.565 --> 01:00:08.296
But, in all honesty, I alone have suffered.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:10.792
Listen, if I weren't such a lady,
I'd let you have...

01:00:10.892 --> 01:00:13.395
Hey, wait a minute here,
I've got enough troubles here.

01:00:13.636 --> 01:00:16.315
Say, Mr. Gentry,
you've been around many years.

01:00:16.472 --> 01:00:19.829
What do you think about giving a prize
to the best amateur stripper?

01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:22.897
I think you're just asking for trouble
by using amateurs.

01:00:22.997 --> 01:00:24.675
Hey, do me a favor,
would you mind your own business?

01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:28.467
Look, some guys are gonna come in here
and lose sight of his chick

01:00:28.567 --> 01:00:31.554
and find her on stage with her clothes off

01:00:31.654 --> 01:00:35.297
and then wanna kill every other guy
in the joint who saw her.

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:38.269
With a cash prize like that,
you're just gonna trouble

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.646
the amount of broads wanting to do that.

01:00:40.746 --> 01:00:42.231
Hey! That's great.

01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:44.838
I'll split the $1000 amongst
the three places.

01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:47.424
- What do you think, Mr. Gentry?
- It's a great idea.

01:00:47.547 --> 01:00:49.718
Get those women on stage,
give them some money

01:00:49.818 --> 01:00:52.126
and let their egos do the rest.

01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:56.457
By then, the money will become secondary
to be chosen the most sexy.

01:00:56.929 --> 01:00:58.140
As a matter of fact,

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.081
this is the biggest of your clubs, isn't it?

01:01:00.181 --> 01:01:02.634
- And the best located?
- Certainly, this is the greatest.

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:07.024
Instead of stringing things out,
why not bring everything together here?

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:10.019
All for $1000 for first prize.

01:01:10.415 --> 01:01:14.470
You can let the women in for free and get
a five-dollar cover charge for the men.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.884
Hey, that's great.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.039
And as a matter of fact, to show you
my heart's in the right place,

01:01:20.139 --> 01:01:23.581
I have a friend at the newspaper,
I'll get her to print a feature story.

01:01:24.143 --> 01:01:27.150
"The greatest striptease show
of the century."

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.778
Hey, that's fantastic.

01:01:29.298 --> 01:01:30.857
Where you've been all my life?

01:01:31.025 --> 01:01:32.539
Say, Gentry, you're a genius!

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.625
Sometimes I can hardly believe it.

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:40.059
You're nuts.
After tonight, you only have a place left.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.007
They'll tear this club apart.

01:01:42.674 --> 01:01:44.396
Stop and think a minute.

01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:46.377
There will be hundreds of strippers.

01:01:46.477 --> 01:01:47.962
Things'll get out of hand.

01:01:48.062 --> 01:01:51.807
And the things will get in hand too.
Money, money, money.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.217
Damn, it's been good to see you, Abe.

01:01:54.317 --> 01:01:56.303
Hey, don't make it so long next time.

01:01:56.403 --> 01:01:58.981
I promise, Lizzie.
Thank you for the information.

01:02:11.816 --> 01:02:13.328
Guess who?

01:02:15.456 --> 01:02:18.300
Weston, what did you find out?

01:02:18.571 --> 01:02:22.953
I found out the women's liberation
movement is really together.

01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:25.436
Hey, you didn't put your bra back on.

01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:29.544
You looked, I mean, probably never will.

01:02:29.644 --> 01:02:32.307
- Fine. Now what did you find out?
- I found out

01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:35.392
that women's rights have been denied
since the beginning of time and...

01:02:35.517 --> 01:02:37.603
Now, what did you find out?

01:02:38.645 --> 01:02:41.348
Well, I found out that Mary McHenry knows

01:02:41.448 --> 01:02:43.996
all the places she was,
at the times of the murders,

01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:46.018
but she was always alone.

01:02:46.118 --> 01:02:51.314
She said... "You know, I wish I knew
who was bumming off those strippers."

01:02:51.457 --> 01:02:55.348
"Womanhood strippers,
coz I'd like to congratulate her."

01:02:55.669 --> 01:02:58.120
"I wished it was me."

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:05.173
Do you think she had anything to do with it?

01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:09.092
I don't know. She really hates strippers.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:10.890
Hmm. What about the wig?

01:03:11.064 --> 01:03:12.970
Mary didn't wear wigs or makeup.

01:03:14.388 --> 01:03:18.697
Hmm. Say, do you think you can get your
editor to print a feature story

01:03:18.797 --> 01:03:22.002
- and run, maybe an ad for tonight's edition?
- Sure.

01:03:22.154 --> 01:03:25.358
Mmm. How would you like to go out tonight?

01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:29.005
- With me?
- Sure.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:32.148
All right, well, we'll finish eating

01:03:32.248 --> 01:03:36.213
and then I'll take you home, pick you up
again around 8:00.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:40.080
Yeah, about 8:00. And wear something sexy.

01:03:41.748 --> 01:03:44.969
- Need anything else?
- Oh, no. This is fine. Thank you.

01:03:50.364 --> 01:03:51.626
Come in.

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:57.180
My. Aren't we risquÃ© tonight?

01:03:57.931 --> 01:03:59.891
I'm certainly willing.

01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:23.915
Folks, how do you like the show so far?

01:04:27.919 --> 01:04:30.481
Pretty bad, huh? Pretty bad, huh?

01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:34.133
...you can do if you want to do your thing.
Go ahead.

01:04:35.259 --> 01:04:38.220
OK, I promised to let him do that,
he used to work at Sing Sing.

01:04:40.639 --> 01:04:43.592
Folks, I want you to drink up,
we have plenty of booze here.

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:44.885
And I got to tell you

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:49.139
that we just got the news on the television
that Tom Jones crossed his legs quickly.

01:04:49.239 --> 01:04:50.482
He's in critical condition.

01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:57.556
OK, we have two more contestants left.

01:04:57.789 --> 01:05:01.610
And the lucky one is gonna get
$1000 for a prize.

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.205
Now here's the next contestant.

01:05:05.706 --> 01:05:07.929
Hey, get them the best table in the house.
Right in there.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:10.169
You're just in time for the second contestant.

01:05:10.376 --> 01:05:13.434
And here she is now, folks.
Our next contestant,

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:14.882
Miss Ruby Diamond.

01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:46.579
Well, what'll it be,
Mr. Big Spender?

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:50.196
I'll have a glass of brandy and the usual
for Miss Weston.

01:05:50.296 --> 01:05:53.002
- A Zombie in a tall glass...
- Yeah, I know.

01:05:57.571 --> 01:05:59.717
Come on, baby.

01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:45.971
Come on, baby.

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:01.862
Shake it, come on.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.126
All right, folks.

01:07:22.965 --> 01:07:24.932
- How do you like that dance?
- All right!

01:07:25.032 --> 01:07:27.345
- Oh, great.
- That was a lovely lady bringing up a cold.

01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:30.514
That was a better way to bring up a family.

01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:35.886
She dresses in one room and I dress in
the next room

01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:38.340
and there's a little hole in the wall.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440
I let her look.

01:07:41.984 --> 01:07:44.320
Take a look at her,
I wanna go home and beat my wife.

01:07:45.654 --> 01:07:47.564
My wife wanted a face lift
that they couldn't do,

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:48.991
for $80 they lowered her body.

01:07:50.993 --> 01:07:53.788
And now, folks, for the last contestant.

01:07:54.372 --> 01:07:56.207
Ah, she's adorable, folks.

01:07:57.166 --> 01:08:00.668
I'd like you to meet Miss Ramona Mona.

01:08:48.466 --> 01:08:51.800
That is the sexiest woman I've ever seen.

01:08:53.636 --> 01:08:55.721
I don't think she's that sexy.

01:09:24.691 --> 01:09:25.961
She's really the best.

01:09:26.502 --> 01:09:29.256
None of the others were anything like her.

01:09:30.674 --> 01:09:33.451
My, my, my...

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.670
She is remarkable.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.840
I can dance better than that any day.

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:43.678
Pretty you are and you have a nice figure,
but not like that.

01:09:43.778 --> 01:09:45.430
How would you know?

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:50.067
You've never seen me like that.

01:09:52.444 --> 01:09:57.581
I'm not criticizing you.
She's built differently.

01:09:57.812 --> 01:10:00.361
And moves it in a different way.

01:10:00.461 --> 01:10:03.581
I can move it better than that.

01:11:39.258 --> 01:11:42.511
Ramona Mona. Oh, isn't she great?

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.601
I didn't think she was that great.

01:11:49.098 --> 01:11:50.859
I'm next.

01:12:37.106 --> 01:12:38.524
Come on, baby.

01:13:24.111 --> 01:13:25.570
Come on, baby.

01:14:04.359 --> 01:14:06.945
Not only has Nancy Nancy won the contest

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:09.155
but she is a new star of Marz's Heaven!

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.622
Congratulations.

01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:31.718
Oh...

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:45.109
Abe, did you really think I was the best?

01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:50.070
Nancy, not only were you the best

01:14:51.322 --> 01:14:54.241
- but you still are.
- Oh.

01:14:56.202 --> 01:14:58.496
I have to take care of something.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.055
Mmm...

01:15:03.002 --> 01:15:07.587
All right, Abe.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:34.719
Well, if it isn't the distinguished
Marlene the barmaid.

01:16:34.869 --> 01:16:38.234
Oh, Marlene, oh, how clumsy... Ah, ah, ah.

01:16:38.481 --> 01:16:42.293
I'm sorry. I forgot the cheese and crackers,
so you won't need that knife.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:47.184
Poor Marlene,
jealous of all the strippers and...

01:16:47.977 --> 01:16:52.241
Because Marzdone was making it with them
and paid no attention to you.

01:16:52.427 --> 01:16:55.997
You despise them and so you mutilated them
because they had something

01:16:56.097 --> 01:16:57.499
you didn't have anymore.

01:16:57.599 --> 01:16:59.196
What was that, Marlene?

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.622
Marlene, let's see.

01:17:10.124 --> 01:17:12.418
Was I right or was I right?

01:17:32.396 --> 01:17:34.116
What a character.

01:17:34.323 --> 01:17:36.863
That's Marlene. All over.

01:17:41.237 --> 01:17:42.837
Oh, Abe.

01:17:45.825 --> 01:17:51.489
Oh, Abe, I was having this terrible dream that
that girl at the club was trying to kill me.

01:17:51.761 --> 01:17:53.083
I know.

01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:55.460
You do?

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.592
Wait a minute, how did I get here?

01:17:58.784 --> 01:18:01.624
Now, forget about that for now.
I'll explain all that tomorrow.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.012
Now, get yourself together.
You're gonna spend the night at my place.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:06.262
And I'll give you your story in the morning.

01:18:27.534 --> 01:18:31.210
Good morning.
May I please speak to Lieutenant Anderson?

01:18:32.788 --> 01:18:35.863
I'm sure he won't mind being awakened.
Tell him it's Abraham Gentry.

01:18:43.465 --> 01:18:47.302
Good morning, Lieutenant.
I hope I didn't awaken you.

01:18:48.554 --> 01:18:51.569
I'm sorry, but I thought
you'd like to know that

01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:56.380
the murderer you were looking for just fell
from a second-story window.

01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:58.434
And she just ruined her makeup.

01:18:58.769 --> 01:18:59.769
Good night, Lieutenant.

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:03.277
Oh, by the way, Lieutenant,
she was an atheist.

01:19:07.656 --> 01:19:10.486
If you're ready, we may be on our way.

01:19:11.328 --> 01:19:15.065
Abe, will you treat me like a woman?

01:19:16.582 --> 01:19:20.202
Of course.
With all the respect you're entitled to.

01:19:20.302 --> 01:19:21.837
Oh, Abe.

01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:32.680
A bit of ingenuity on my part,
it was as simple as that.

01:19:33.556 --> 01:19:35.612
I didn't suspect Marlene,

01:19:35.712 --> 01:19:38.922
until I remembered an incident
with an exiled lady wrestler.

01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:42.098
My mental powers, I was sure of,

01:19:42.198 --> 01:19:45.163
and so I set up the situation
in which I can trap

01:19:45.263 --> 01:19:47.895
the murderer and lure her into my hands.

01:19:47.995 --> 01:19:50.961
Hopefully, in the middle of one of her
facial extravaganzas.

01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:55.203
You mean to tell me that you used me
as the meat to bait your trap.

01:19:55.578 --> 01:19:57.330
I gave you that honor.

01:19:57.789 --> 01:19:59.636
Why, you no good dirty rat!

01:19:59.736 --> 01:20:01.481
Now, we had to come face to face
with the murderer.

01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:03.119
"We had to come face to face"?

01:20:03.219 --> 01:20:04.745
I had to come face to face!

01:20:04.845 --> 01:20:06.442
And I almost lost mine.

01:20:06.618 --> 01:20:11.385
We had nothing of great importance to lose,
if my theory had been proved unsound.

01:20:12.095 --> 01:20:13.387
Now, I came in time, didn't I?

01:20:13.487 --> 01:20:15.181
What if you had come a second too late?

01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:17.090
Well, I knew.

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:21.069
Now, do you want to quibble over nothing
or do you want your story?

01:20:21.632 --> 01:20:22.813
Go on.

01:20:23.939 --> 01:20:28.617
I went to see an old
and dear friend of mine, Lizzie Murdoch.

01:20:28.743 --> 01:20:32.255
Better known to her wrestling fans
as Lizzie the Snake,

01:20:32.372 --> 01:20:35.867
- or the Python Lady...
- I figure she'd be a friend of yours.

01:20:36.409 --> 01:20:37.609
Go on.

01:20:38.578 --> 01:20:41.656
Unrelated in my memory,
I have a lady league wrestler named

01:20:41.756 --> 01:20:42.949
Betty the Beautiful.

01:20:43.049 --> 01:20:47.349
The wrestler extraordinaire,
who with her perfect body

01:20:47.449 --> 01:20:52.300
perfectly stripped every opponent
she got on top of.

01:20:53.426 --> 01:20:56.236
Now, Lizzie's recollection was
the same as mine.

01:20:56.354 --> 01:21:00.270
Betty wanted out of the wrestling game
and got into strip-teasing.

01:21:00.504 --> 01:21:03.407
- Yeah.
- And she was an instant sensation

01:21:03.507 --> 01:21:07.249
and of course was picked up
and managed by none other than

01:21:07.365 --> 01:21:10.046
- Marzdone Mobilie.
- No kidding.

01:21:10.609 --> 01:21:12.153
I do not kid.

01:21:13.863 --> 01:21:17.921
Marzdone made a lot of money with her
and even decided to marry her,

01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:20.762
- until her unfortunate accident.
- Which was?

01:21:22.121 --> 01:21:24.623
Well, one night,
Betty was trapped in her bedroom

01:21:24.748 --> 01:21:28.087
when a fire broke out
and before they could get there to help her

01:21:28.427 --> 01:21:29.753
she was burned badly.

01:21:29.879 --> 01:21:30.879
And?

01:21:31.263 --> 01:21:34.291
Well, plastic surgery was successful
on her face.

01:21:34.391 --> 01:21:37.386
But her head and her chest
were completely disfigured.

01:21:38.803 --> 01:21:42.570
Well, Marzdone had no further use for her,
but out of pity,

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.977
he changed her name and gave her a job
as a waitress...

01:21:45.144 --> 01:21:47.221
So with Marzdone having
nothing else to do with her,

01:21:47.321 --> 01:21:49.306
she slowly started going nuts

01:21:49.406 --> 01:21:52.726
and became insanely jealous of all the girls
who had what Marzdone wanted.

01:21:52.915 --> 01:21:53.915
Exactly.

01:21:54.015 --> 01:21:56.626
Well, what triggered off
your memory about Marlene?

01:21:56.726 --> 01:21:59.765
And how are you so sure
it wasn't Grout or Mary McHenry?

01:22:00.161 --> 01:22:01.993
Oh, it was something Marzdone said...

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:04.889
He said that she couldn't strip
because she didn't have the chest for it.

01:22:04.989 --> 01:22:07.156
Well, that started me thinking.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:11.494
And later on,
when we had a confrontation together

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:15.310
she threatened me
with some sort of a gesture

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:18.134
- that only a lady wrestler would use.
- And Grout?

01:22:18.797 --> 01:22:19.844
Well, Grout...

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:23.756
I was pretty sure Grout wasn't the murderer
after seeing all those clues

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.225
that seemed to exploit him.

01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:28.657
As a matter of fact,
I even tried to catch him

01:22:28.757 --> 01:22:30.688
to tell him I no longer suspected him.

01:22:31.773 --> 01:22:33.275
And Mary, the women's libber?

01:22:33.553 --> 01:22:38.546
Yes, Mary didn't wear makeup and from
the information the boys in the lab gave me

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:42.024
I knew the murderer wore a wig
and super cover makeup.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.131
Which Marlene needed
to cover those surgery scars.

01:22:44.231 --> 01:22:45.286
Go on.

01:22:46.079 --> 01:22:49.407
Well, I had to stage that naked extravaganza

01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:50.667
to bait her on.

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:53.640
I led her to believe you
and I had something going

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.120
and when you won that contest...

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.672
Wait a minute.

01:22:57.089 --> 01:22:59.383
Did I legitimately win that contest?

01:22:59.925 --> 01:23:03.765
Not only did you really win that contest
fair and square,

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:07.626
I'm led to believe that you have
the finest form I have ever seen.

01:23:08.892 --> 01:23:10.435
Poor Marlene.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.600
Hers is the saddest story of all.

01:23:12.967 --> 01:23:15.223
She lost face three times.

01:23:15.803 --> 01:23:20.742
First with her wrestling fans,
then with her striptease patrons.

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:25.200
And finally, between a layer of concrete
and the wheel of a car.

01:23:25.909 --> 01:23:29.503
She did go out in style though.
It was a new car.

01:23:30.455 --> 01:23:31.655
Abe...

01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:35.794
There's still something I haven't lost yet.

01:23:36.128 --> 01:23:40.007
Oh, it isn't your nerve or your sense
of humor, uh, let's see, what could it be?

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:47.930
You've seen enough.
