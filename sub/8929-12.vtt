♪ Beast Wars

00:32.404 --> 00:34.405
( dramatic theme playing )

00:41.239 --> 00:44.906
Yes. Yes. Almost there.

00:45.006 --> 00:48.307
This may be the final process I've been seeking.

00:48.407 --> 00:50.174
Yes.

00:54.341 --> 00:55.942
( crystal hums )

00:57.342 --> 00:59.309
No! Blast!

00:59.409 --> 01:03.043
Terrorsaur, get me another energon crystal. Now!

01:03.143 --> 01:05.143
No! I've had enough.

01:05.243 --> 01:08.844
I refuse to serve such an incompetent leader any longer.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.478
You've wasted our precious energon crystals

01:11.578 --> 01:13.511
for the last time, Megatron.

01:13.611 --> 01:16.778
Whoa. Bad karma at the loser lair.

01:16.878 --> 01:20.512
Waspinator wants to fight now!

01:20.612 --> 01:24.179
Hm. It appears serious this time.

01:24.279 --> 01:26.913
You will regret this rebellion, Terrorsaur.

01:27.013 --> 01:28.880
Yes.

01:30.614 --> 01:32.381
That's dissention, all right.

01:32.481 --> 01:33.547
Cool!

01:33.647 --> 01:35.682
Now aren't you glad we got cable?

01:35.782 --> 01:40.282
Looks like we hardwired that spy camera just in time.

01:40.383 --> 01:45.016
We? Heh-hey, it was my fuzzy butt on the line out there.

01:45.117 --> 01:46.816
Shh! Look.

01:51.118 --> 01:55.118
No! You fools! You'll hit the energon.

02:00.085 --> 02:02.853
( rumbling )

02:02.953 --> 02:05.053
Whoa.

02:13.621 --> 02:17.322
That place looks, like, totally slagged.

02:17.422 --> 02:18.522
( beeping )

02:18.622 --> 02:22.089
It is. I detect no signs of life.

02:22.189 --> 02:25.523
Not a Pred energy signature anywhere.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.124
Hm, can that be confirmed?

02:28.224 --> 02:32.424
Hey! His sensors don't lie, dino-dip.

02:32.524 --> 02:33.724
Then we may have to accept

02:33.824 --> 02:36.492
a rather unexpected development, friends.

02:36.592 --> 02:42.226
It looks like the Maximals have won the beast wars.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.761
( sensor beeping )

02:51.494 --> 02:53.495
No life forms.

02:53.595 --> 02:57.362
But the base energon field dampers are still functional.

02:57.461 --> 02:58.462
Good.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.129
( clattering )

03:00.229 --> 03:03.896
All right. Then let's, uh, pillage and plunder, heh-heh.

03:03.996 --> 03:05.630
Only for space drive parts.

03:05.730 --> 03:08.997
It is a Predacon ship and still very dangerous.

03:09.097 --> 03:13.664
Yeah? Then, uh, let's say we make old chopper face go first.

03:13.765 --> 03:18.332
Yes, that would be logical. I will take point.

03:21.532 --> 03:24.867
Man, I'm pushin' all of his hot buttons,

03:24.967 --> 03:26.633
and I'm gettin' nada.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.234
What's with him?

03:28.334 --> 03:31.501
Can't you figure it out?

03:40.668 --> 03:44.403
( growling ): This is what you seek.

03:44.503 --> 03:47.070
I detect no hostiles.

03:47.170 --> 03:51.371
I will reconnoiter elsewhere.

03:52.904 --> 03:55.204
Yo, why--? Scrape ape.

03:55.304 --> 03:58.605
So, um, what are we gonna do with Dinobot?

03:58.705 --> 04:01.105
Why should we do anything?

04:01.205 --> 04:03.240
Man, look at him.

04:03.340 --> 04:07.140
He's still a Predacon. He's only with us 'cause he knew we'd win.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.374
Not because he believed in what we stood for.

04:10.474 --> 04:11.907
He's a soldier.

04:12.007 --> 04:15.808
And with the enemy gone, who else is he gonna fight?

04:17.142 --> 04:19.275
Look, this ain't a good time

04:19.375 --> 04:21.442
to prove you're a wimp chimp, buddy.

04:21.542 --> 04:24.443
And he'll snuff you out the minute you turn your back.

04:24.543 --> 04:27.277
( beeping )

04:38.979 --> 04:42.546
Get the others. We've got what we need.

04:52.647 --> 04:54.882
( snarls )

04:54.981 --> 04:56.548
( laughs )

04:56.648 --> 04:58.982
Hey, got ya!

04:59.082 --> 05:01.215
Where did you find these?

05:01.315 --> 05:03.749
Just over there.

05:03.849 --> 05:08.316
Alas, poor Tarantulas. I knew him, Cheetor.

05:08.417 --> 05:12.984
This is the leg that stalked so many victims.

05:13.084 --> 05:14.785
( growling )

05:14.885 --> 05:18.085
That it should come to this.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.886
Aw, do you need a hug?

05:20.986 --> 05:22.819
( growls )

05:22.919 --> 05:25.620
Hey, hey, hey, we're leavin'.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.787
We got the parts we need. Come on.

05:28.887 --> 05:30.888
( growls )

05:57.059 --> 06:00.958
But we still can't trust Dinobot.

06:01.058 --> 06:03.559
Before we decide where he's going,

06:03.659 --> 06:05.959
we better decide where we're going.

06:06.060 --> 06:09.927
I'm almost done with these drive repairs.

06:10.027 --> 06:13.060
First order of business, is the stasis pod still in orbit?

06:13.161 --> 06:15.795
They have to be recovered and our comrades rescued.

06:15.895 --> 06:17.961
We also have to alert Tigatron.

06:18.062 --> 06:19.162
Okay, but after that,

06:19.262 --> 06:21.629
we start exploring the galaxy again, right?

06:21.729 --> 06:24.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you talkin' here?

06:24.196 --> 06:27.197
Heh, have you taken a good look at this scrap heap lately?

06:27.296 --> 06:29.497
We even make it to space,

06:29.597 --> 06:33.964
and the only place we're headed is back to Cybertron.

06:34.064 --> 06:36.098
I'm afraid Rattrap's right.

06:36.198 --> 06:40.166
Who-hoo-hoo-hoo. Yeah! And about time too.

06:40.266 --> 06:44.299
Ooh, I can just hear the dames cryin' for me.

06:44.399 --> 06:46.533
Perhaps it is the thought of your return

06:46.633 --> 06:49.934
that causes their unhappiness.

06:50.034 --> 06:54.201
Heh, hey, chopper face. Whoo, an actual comeback.

06:54.301 --> 06:57.102
Eh, a little lame, but I can tell you're feeling better.

06:57.202 --> 06:59.536
And for good reason.

06:59.636 --> 07:03.003
I shall not see you again.

07:03.103 --> 07:05.669
Whoa! Another dig.

07:05.769 --> 07:08.103
Shh! What are you saying, Dinobot?

07:08.203 --> 07:11.904
You will not return with us to Cybertron?

07:12.004 --> 07:15.304
No. On Cybertron

07:15.404 --> 07:17.971
I will merely be a Predacon criminal.

07:18.071 --> 07:22.939
But on this planet, I have no equal.

07:23.039 --> 07:28.207
I shall remain to conquer and rule.

07:28.307 --> 07:30.274
I understand.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.174
Nonetheless, let the record show

07:32.274 --> 07:34.774
that I advise against this action.

07:34.874 --> 07:38.375
It will eventually lead to your destruction.

07:38.475 --> 07:40.909
Eventually.

07:41.009 --> 07:45.077
Eventually can be a long time, Optimus Primal.

07:45.177 --> 07:48.644
I salute my formal Maximal leader

07:48.744 --> 07:51.777
and my former comrades.

07:51.877 --> 07:53.677
Goodbye.

07:56.344 --> 07:57.745
Dinobot?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.212
CHEETOR: Dinobot?

08:01.312 --> 08:03.312

08:52.021 --> 08:53.787
( chomping )

08:57.321 --> 09:00.022
Stop slobbering on me, Tarantulas.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.856
I am feasting!

09:02.956 --> 09:05.956
Unh. There was more room.

09:06.056 --> 09:08.723
Tarantulas is fat enough already.

09:08.824 --> 09:11.857
If Waspinator does not stop cuddling me

09:11.957 --> 09:13.858
like a stuffed toy when he sleeps,

09:13.957 --> 09:15.191
I'll eat him as well.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.325
I'd like to see you try!

09:16.424 --> 09:18.692
Yes, I will! I will so! No, you won't!

09:18.791 --> 09:20.859
You all make me sick!

09:20.959 --> 09:25.460
I can't stand this any longer. Megatron, I've gotta get out!

09:25.560 --> 09:27.960
( laughing )

09:29.526 --> 09:32.727
We wouldn't be here if you didn't trip over that spy cable.

09:32.828 --> 09:34.427
You are correct, Scorponok.

09:34.527 --> 09:36.861
But thanks to Terrorsaur's inadvertent discovery

09:36.961 --> 09:38.628
of our enemy's spy camera,

09:38.728 --> 09:43.729
we were able to pull this little deception. Yes.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.429
But what if they detect us? Don't forget,

09:46.529 --> 09:49.831
my signature damping device is only experimental.

09:49.930 --> 09:53.031
We have only to wait until they repair their ship.

09:53.131 --> 09:56.498
And then attack, while their guard is down.

09:56.598 --> 09:58.331
With the Maximals' ship in our possession,

09:58.431 --> 10:01.499
we will be able to recover the orbiting stasis pods,

10:01.599 --> 10:05.233
containing Maximals eager, heh-heh-heh,

10:05.333 --> 10:07.667
to become Predacons.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.067
( ground rumbles )

10:09.166 --> 10:10.934
So no one leaves!

10:11.034 --> 10:13.835
Leaving? Who said anything about leaving?

10:13.934 --> 10:16.001
Ow! What was that?

10:16.102 --> 10:19.135
( rocks tumbling ) MEGATRON: A spy!

10:19.235 --> 10:22.203
It's that traitor, Dinobot. Stop him!

10:22.302 --> 10:25.136
Predacons, terrorize!

10:25.236 --> 10:27.236
( dramatic rock theme playing )

10:37.038 --> 10:40.572
Blackarachnia, terrorize!

10:40.672 --> 10:44.606
Scorponok, terrorize!

10:44.706 --> 10:48.574
Tarantulas, terrorize!

10:48.673 --> 10:53.674
Megatron, terrorize!

10:53.774 --> 10:56.975
Megatron's forces survive!

10:57.074 --> 11:00.509
I must warn Optimus.

11:00.609 --> 11:06.410
Hm. It feels strange to be inside an artificial structure.

11:06.510 --> 11:10.710
Hey, hey, hey, it's Tigatron the barbarian.

11:10.810 --> 11:13.544
Welcome back to civilization, guy.

11:13.644 --> 11:15.644
We're goin' home.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.511
And you're just in time.

11:17.611 --> 11:18.678
All systems.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.045
( beeping )

11:20.145 --> 11:21.078
Check.

11:21.178 --> 11:22.745
Let's do it.

11:22.846 --> 11:24.279
Power up.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.446
( beeping )

11:35.614 --> 11:38.748
Liftoff in three cycles and counting.

11:38.849 --> 11:42.216
Man, heh-heh, when we get back to Cybertron,

11:42.316 --> 11:45.850
I am gonna take you to this sweet little hole in the wall

11:45.950 --> 11:47.583
where I guarantee--

11:47.683 --> 11:48.616
Dinobot!

11:48.716 --> 11:49.883
Eh, he ain't gonna be there.

11:49.983 --> 11:51.116
RHINOX: Optimus!

11:51.217 --> 11:52.350
I see him.

11:52.450 --> 11:56.418
Aw, man! That just shorts my circuits.

11:56.518 --> 11:58.651
All right! He's comin' back!

11:58.751 --> 12:02.619
RHINOX: Problem is, he's not alone.

12:02.719 --> 12:06.453
No! Dinobot!

12:10.353 --> 12:12.354
( groaning )

12:22.522 --> 12:24.223
I'm going for Dinobot.

12:24.323 --> 12:26.523
We have less than two cycles to liftoff.

12:26.623 --> 12:28.623
This thing's barely hanging together as it is.

12:28.723 --> 12:30.123
I can't shut it down.

12:30.224 --> 12:31.424
I don't want you to.

12:31.524 --> 12:33.691
If we're not back in time, lift off without us.

12:33.791 --> 12:34.991
No way.

12:35.091 --> 12:37.824
That's a priority order. Understood?

12:37.924 --> 12:38.825
( sighs )

12:38.925 --> 12:41.126
Optimus Primal, maximize!

12:53.560 --> 12:54.594
Wha?

12:54.694 --> 12:56.261
I'll help. Wait for me.

12:56.361 --> 12:58.128
Cheetor, maximize!

12:58.228 --> 12:59.628
( snarls )

12:59.728 --> 13:01.295
Cheetor, no!

13:01.395 --> 13:04.129
Cheetor, get back to your post. That's an order.

13:04.229 --> 13:05.963
You'll never get to Dinobot without backup.

13:06.063 --> 13:08.697
Besides, Cybertron wouldn't be the same without you.

13:08.797 --> 13:12.097
All right. Let's hit 'em hard and fast.

13:12.197 --> 13:13.763
I'm your bot.

13:16.431 --> 13:19.298
I cannot sit idle while my comrades battle the enemy.

13:19.398 --> 13:23.299
Tigatron, maximize!

13:23.398 --> 13:24.866
Back in your seat.

13:24.966 --> 13:26.333
You heard the orders. But--

13:26.433 --> 13:28.266
I said sit!

13:28.366 --> 13:30.633
We're taking this bird to Cybertron,

13:30.733 --> 13:32.100
and I need all of you to do it.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.134
Rattrap, astro navigation.

13:34.234 --> 13:36.301
Tigatron, get ships' guns online.

13:36.401 --> 13:38.068
Optimus is gonna need some firepower.

13:38.168 --> 13:39.201
Move!

13:39.301 --> 13:40.768
Yes, sir!

13:48.703 --> 13:51.837
Give me cover fire. I've got to get to Dinobot.

13:51.937 --> 13:53.204
My pleasure.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.304
( dramatic theme playing )

14:13.441 --> 14:18.774
This is strategically unsound.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.208
( grunting )

14:20.308 --> 14:23.408
OPTIMUS: Tell me about it back on Cybertron.

14:24.376 --> 14:25.543

14:28.109 --> 14:30.910

14:34.644 --> 14:37.178
They're finished. Head for the ship.

14:37.278 --> 14:39.778
( beeping )

14:39.879 --> 14:42.012
Ship's guns, fire!

15:20.885 --> 15:23.318

15:33.220 --> 15:35.587
The train's pulling out!

15:35.687 --> 15:38.588
Optimus!

15:42.555 --> 15:45.155
Come on. Come on.

15:55.690 --> 15:57.458
( roars )

16:00.892 --> 16:02.792
( grunts )

16:02.892 --> 16:04.792
Gotcha, big bot.

16:15.294 --> 16:16.461
Aah!

16:35.764 --> 16:38.864
No!

16:42.498 --> 16:46.332
Optimus!

16:51.400 --> 16:52.901
( grunts )

17:07.636 --> 17:12.037
You should have left me behind.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.371
Hey, pal,

17:13.471 --> 17:17.005
Optimus got left behind just to save your scaly skin!

17:17.105 --> 17:21.205
So don't spoil the sacrifice! Capiche?

17:22.272 --> 17:25.939
Oh, but it is already spoiled. Yes.

17:26.039 --> 17:27.139
( grunts )

17:27.239 --> 17:28.206
( grunts )

17:28.306 --> 17:30.373
( both grunt )

17:40.742 --> 17:42.242
Oh, boy.

17:42.341 --> 17:46.843
Now, only you stand in the way of my ultimate conquest.

17:46.943 --> 17:48.843
Rattrap, maximi--

17:48.943 --> 17:49.943
( groans )

17:50.043 --> 17:53.011
Hm. None of that, vermin. No.

17:53.110 --> 17:57.878
For now, I shall crush you like a rat in a trap.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.045
No!

18:00.845 --> 18:04.145
Not a chance!

18:09.813 --> 18:12.313
( both grunting )

18:16.247 --> 18:19.015
( groaning )

18:20.814 --> 18:22.815
( alarm beeping )

18:39.718 --> 18:43.885
Aah! Ah! We're goin' down! Do somethin'!

18:52.921 --> 18:55.754
We're all gonna die.

18:55.854 --> 19:00.055
Wait. Look. Down in the sky.

19:00.155 --> 19:02.222
Is it a bird?

19:02.322 --> 19:04.055
Maybe a plane.

19:04.155 --> 19:05.355
Nah,

19:05.455 --> 19:08.856
it's Optimus!

19:10.657 --> 19:13.157
( both grunt )

19:13.257 --> 19:15.591
( triumphant theme playing )

19:46.863 --> 19:48.529
Damage report.

19:48.629 --> 19:51.664
In a word, busted.

19:51.764 --> 19:54.164
She won't fly again.

19:54.263 --> 19:57.531
What about Rattrap and Dinobot? Are they okay?

19:57.631 --> 20:00.331
Man, you know, it's your fault

20:00.431 --> 20:02.731
that I ain't kickin' back on Cybertron right now,

20:02.831 --> 20:04.866
you overgrown, stinky iguana.

20:04.966 --> 20:09.400
Hm. I've done the planet a favor.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.767
Hey! Hey!

20:10.867 --> 20:15.100
You want me to show you just how velociraptors got extinct?

20:15.201 --> 20:16.568
( clears throat )

20:16.668 --> 20:18.334
They're taking it well.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.801
Wouldn't want 'em any other way.

20:20.901 --> 20:24.136
Go scurry through a maze, mouse.

20:24.235 --> 20:27.403
Yeah? Well, why don't you come and make me, lizard lips?

20:27.503 --> 20:30.137
If you wasn't inside that chamber...

20:30.236 --> 20:33.803
( Rattrap screeches )

20:33.903 --> 20:36.771
