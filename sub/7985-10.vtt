MELISSA: <i>Kalani's in pain.</i>

00:03.268 --> 00:04.470
<i>Her back is killing her.</i>

00:04.470 --> 00:06.038
ABBY LEE:
<i>I'm the first teacher</i>

00:06.038 --> 00:07.373
that does not want a kid
dancing if they're hurt.

00:07.373 --> 00:08.307
Absolutely not.

00:08.307 --> 00:09.308
Brynn really lucks out

00:09.308 --> 00:11.310
<i>being in a duet with Maddie.</i>

00:11.310 --> 00:13.479
Your child's getting
everything handed to her.

00:13.479 --> 00:15.280
ASHLEE: <i>Abby is gonna see Brynn</i>
<i>and Maddie dance together,</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:17.750
<i>and that's gonna</i>
<i>be it for Kendall.</i>

00:19.685 --> 00:23.288
You are responsible
for what you put on stage!
Get over yourself.

00:23.288 --> 00:26.925
It's not fair to Kendall,
and it's not fair to Nia.

00:26.925 --> 00:30.763
EMCEE: Our highest scoring
duo/trio, "Together As One."

ABBY LEE: <i>Coming up</i>

00:34.466 --> 00:36.135
We have three solos this week.

00:36.135 --> 00:39.338
<i>Brynn, Maddie, Kendall.</i>

00:39.338 --> 00:41.974
I feel like I'm not
gonna win this week.

00:41.974 --> 00:43.842
ABBY LEE:
You're the only one here?
We're the only one here.

00:43.842 --> 00:44.810
What's happening?

00:46.378 --> 00:49.014
You guys didn't come today,
and that's your fault!

00:49.014 --> 00:51.383
You don't care about these kids.
Bull (bleep)!

00:51.383 --> 00:52.751
You're a puppet!
ASHLEE: Go to hell.

00:52.751 --> 00:53.952
HOLLY: <i>This is really</i>
<i>like a cult.</i>

00:53.952 --> 00:55.954
And then of course
you have Abby Lee Miller

00:55.954 --> 00:57.456
as the leader of the cult.

00:57.456 --> 00:59.625
Here, drink
this Kool‐Aid and die.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.694
"Okay, whatever you say."

01:01.694 --> 01:03.062

01:52.077 --> 01:54.079
Hmm.

01:54.079 --> 01:56.482
The moms have disliked me

01:57.750 --> 02:00.085
I have no idea where they are,

what they're doing.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.055
Hey! Hi, babe.

02:03.055 --> 02:04.623
BRYNN: Hi.
Hi.
ABBY LEE:
You're the only one here?

02:04.623 --> 02:06.625
We're the only one here.
What's happening?

02:06.625 --> 02:08.794
I don't know, nobody told me
anything. They just...

02:08.794 --> 02:11.263
ABBY LEE: Well, I was
running a little late.

02:11.263 --> 02:14.767
Well, I just don't have
no clue where everybody is.
"Don't have no clue"?

02:14.767 --> 02:18.003
ASHLEE: <i>It's really just</i>
<i>Brynn and I in an empty studio.</i>

02:18.003 --> 02:19.905
<i>The ALDC is a ghost town.</i>

02:19.905 --> 02:21.406
<i>Abby is gonna realize</i>
<i>that Brynn and I are</i>

02:21.406 --> 02:23.342
<i>the only ones that are really</i>
<i>committed to this team.</i>

02:23.342 --> 02:25.744
I mean, it really could end up
working out in our favor.

02:25.744 --> 02:27.079
I mean, did everybody quit?

02:27.079 --> 02:28.580
Like, what... is going on?

02:32.284 --> 02:33.619
And the kids aren't...
and the kids aren't...

02:37.055 --> 02:39.725
I can't imagine
that Maddie is not

02:39.725 --> 02:42.895
putting up a hissy fit somewhere
that she is not here.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.229
ASHLEE:
I know nothing.

02:47.499 --> 02:48.834
Do they ever just
not show up like this?

02:48.834 --> 02:50.035
It's weird.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.503
And I don't know why they just

02:51.503 --> 02:52.838
wouldn't tell me.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.039
The moms have gone
on strike before.

02:54.039 --> 02:55.340
<i>It's silly.</i>

02:55.340 --> 02:56.542
<i>It doesn't hurt me,</i>

02:56.542 --> 02:58.277
<i>it doesn't hurt my studio.</i>

02:58.277 --> 03:02.681
The only people that get hurt
by their ridiculous child antics

03:02.681 --> 03:03.916
is their own children.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.751
<i>I mean, haven't they</i>
<i>learned by now?</i>

03:05.751 --> 03:07.853
Everyone's replaceable.

03:07.853 --> 03:09.121
ABBY LEE: Okay, so, sweetie,
keep warming up.

03:09.121 --> 03:10.355
Do whatever you can,
and then, um...

03:10.355 --> 03:11.623
and we'll get going.

03:11.623 --> 03:13.592
ASHLEE: We're the only ones
here to rehearse today.

03:13.592 --> 03:15.260
If there's, like, a reason
they're not showing up,

03:15.260 --> 03:17.229
what is the plan?
I don't know.

03:17.229 --> 03:20.532
I've tried to get them to not
show up... for six years.

03:20.532 --> 03:22.067
(laughs)
ASHLEE: I'm here.

03:24.803 --> 03:26.138
Hi, babe.
GIANNA: Hi.

03:26.138 --> 03:27.673
How you doing? Good?
Good.

03:27.673 --> 03:28.841
Are you ready?

03:28.841 --> 03:30.375
It's just me and Brynn.
No.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.078
Well, luckily...
(chuckles)

03:33.078 --> 03:35.447
We were deciding what we're
gonna do if nobody comes.
She thinks they're not coming.

03:35.447 --> 03:37.516
I haven't talked to anyone.

03:37.516 --> 03:39.651
How disrespectful.

03:39.651 --> 03:41.119
ABBY LEE:
For solos this week,

03:41.119 --> 03:44.990
we're doing three famous
deaths in Hollywood.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.860
Okay.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.728
And Brynn did get
selected to do a solo.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.463
ASHLEE:
Oh, good. Yay.

03:51.463 --> 03:54.433
And it's a dark character,
and it's a dark piece.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.101
All the pieces are dark.
ASHLEE: Okay.

03:56.101 --> 04:00.239
She is doing a piece
called "Black Dahlia."

04:00.239 --> 04:02.174
You've never had to do something
like that. That'll be fun.

04:03.308 --> 04:04.476
So, I'm gonna go eat,

04:04.476 --> 04:05.811
and you want to
get her in there?

04:05.811 --> 04:06.812
All right.

04:06.812 --> 04:08.013
ASHLEE: Okay.
Go to work.

04:08.013 --> 04:09.214
ABBY LEE:
<i>The silver lining</i>

04:09.214 --> 04:10.449
to the moms not showing up

04:10.449 --> 04:12.818
<i>is now I get to focus on Brynn.</i>

04:12.818 --> 04:15.821
Now that Maddie has returned,
I'm not so sure

04:15.821 --> 04:17.723
that Brynn should be a permanent
member of the team or not.

04:17.723 --> 04:20.092
<i>She doesn't connect</i>
<i>emotionally.</i>

04:20.092 --> 04:21.827
Brynn does well
in a group dance,

04:21.827 --> 04:24.496
<i>but you don't stand out</i>
<i>in the group.</i>

04:24.496 --> 04:25.731
<i>You don't draw me in.</i>

04:25.731 --> 04:28.500
Once she does,
she'll be unstoppable.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.502
ASHLEE: Hey, we're gonna
get a lot done.

04:30.502 --> 04:31.603
There's not gonna be
any distractions.

04:32.938 --> 04:34.606
ASHLEE:
Kind of weird.

04:34.606 --> 04:37.376
All right, work hard.

04:37.376 --> 04:39.044
GIANNA:
Music.

04:39.044 --> 04:41.046
Spiral.

04:41.046 --> 04:43.115
I'm really excited
to perform a dark character.

04:43.115 --> 04:44.483
All the other moms think

04:44.483 --> 04:46.451
<i>that I can only do</i>
<i>pretty lyrical,</i>

04:46.451 --> 04:48.453
<i>but this week,</i>
<i>I'm gonna prove them wrong.</i>

04:48.453 --> 04:50.088
GIANNA: Freeze. Let's go to
our split thing and look up.

04:50.088 --> 04:51.456
<i>Yeah, it's gonna be like that.</i>

04:51.456 --> 04:53.458
Here, did you ever
see a picture of her?

04:53.458 --> 04:54.793
Sure.
Here.

04:54.793 --> 04:55.961
Let me look for one.

04:57.162 --> 04:58.730
(chuckles):
There are all these pictures.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.232
BRYNN:
So once I saw the pictures

05:00.232 --> 05:01.967
and heard the story,

05:01.967 --> 05:03.969
I was horrified.

05:03.969 --> 05:07.072
Her body's sliced in half,
first of all.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.840
Black Dahlia was murdered...

05:08.840 --> 05:11.310
Ew.
Here,
let me find one.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.480
... and she was cut from ear
to ear, like, with a knife.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.849
<i>So it's pretty disgusting.</i>

05:17.849 --> 05:19.518
So you're...
I'm sure your mom is...
Is that, like,

05:19.518 --> 05:20.986
a real, live person?
Like, real?
Yeah.

05:20.986 --> 05:22.955
Like, that happened once?
Yeah, it really happened.

05:24.823 --> 05:26.158
Wow.

05:26.158 --> 05:27.526

What the heck are
you guys doing?

06:01.059 --> 06:02.060
Seriously?

06:02.060 --> 06:03.562
We had so much to do.
We were late.

06:03.562 --> 06:05.497
Done.
Uh, you know, we
already have an Abby.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.332
We don't need four
more Abbys, seriously.
(groaning)

06:07.332 --> 06:09.468
We're not Abby.
We're not Abby.

06:09.468 --> 06:12.804
Listen, we are so sick
of Abby's behavior.

06:12.804 --> 06:16.274
Week in and week out,
not showing up,

06:16.274 --> 06:19.478
<i>showing up in her pajamas,</i>
<i>eating burgers,</i>

06:19.478 --> 06:21.413
<i>eating nachos,</i>
<i>leaving whenever she wants.</i>

06:21.413 --> 06:23.915
<i>It is not fair to us.</i>

06:23.915 --> 06:27.586
So we decided to show up late
in our pajamas

06:27.586 --> 06:29.921
<i>to give Abby a dose</i>
<i>of her own medicine.</i>

06:29.921 --> 06:32.924
ASHLEE: But that kind of screws
up the whole week for everybody.

06:32.924 --> 06:34.926
Well, you haven't been doing it
as long as we have,

06:34.926 --> 06:36.928
so... it's all good.

06:36.928 --> 06:38.263
Oh, here are the girls.

06:38.263 --> 06:41.266
(girls laughing)

06:41.266 --> 06:43.402
You guys look great.
Is Abby here?

06:43.402 --> 06:45.404
Why aren't
you guys dancing?

06:46.938 --> 06:48.273
JILL:
Since when?

06:48.273 --> 06:49.808
We had... we had
to do school.

06:49.808 --> 06:51.376
JILL: <i>Why is Brynn dancing,</i>
<i>no one else is dancing?</i>

06:51.376 --> 06:53.645
We're not allowed to dance.
Her mom is here.

06:53.645 --> 06:54.913
ASHLEE:
No, they weren't allowed to.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.049
We didn't tell our kids
anything this morning.

06:57.049 --> 07:00.585
Once in four years we have
come in a little late.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.821
JILL: <i>Our girls were not</i>
<i>late for dance.</i>

07:02.821 --> 07:04.556
Our girls have been here
all morning.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.659
We decided to show up late
to teach Abby a lesson.

07:07.659 --> 07:10.262
Ashlee knew exactly
where they were.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.297
<i>She should have had</i>
<i>all of the girls</i>

07:12.297 --> 07:14.166
<i>dancing in the studio,</i>
<i>not just Brynn.</i>

07:14.166 --> 07:16.168
MELISSA: No, you guys have
to get your clothes off

07:16.168 --> 07:17.602
and start stretching.
We're here.

07:17.602 --> 07:18.904
Go stretch.
Go ahead.

07:18.904 --> 07:19.905
Oh, hi, girls.

07:19.905 --> 07:20.872
ALL:
Hi.

07:20.872 --> 07:21.873
What's happening?

07:21.873 --> 07:23.542
Sorry we're late.
We got caught up.

07:23.542 --> 07:24.543
We couldn't get out of bed.

07:24.543 --> 07:27.212
I know they're making fun of me.

07:27.212 --> 07:28.480
Like I care.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.516
<i>Today these moms made</i>
<i>a decision.</i>

07:31.516 --> 07:33.185
And their decision
was detrimental

07:33.185 --> 07:35.487
to their children
and to the team.

07:35.487 --> 07:37.823
We've lost a whole day
of rehearsal,

07:37.823 --> 07:39.658
and that's on them, not me.

07:39.658 --> 07:41.660
ASHLEE:
Yeah, Abby was here, dressed
and ready to go for pyramid,

07:41.660 --> 07:43.495
and nobody was here but me.

07:43.495 --> 07:47.365
We had a lot... lot, lot
of choreography to do.

07:47.365 --> 07:48.600
MELISSA:
For the group dance this week?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.169
The group dance and,
uh, and three solos.

07:51.169 --> 07:53.238
Well, I guess
we missed Brynn's solo.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.740
Brynn was the only
kid out here,

07:55.740 --> 07:57.809
and I told Gianna,
"Go ahead and take her in."

07:57.809 --> 07:59.177
And she said, "Okay."
That was it.

07:59.177 --> 08:00.812
Well, why is she
learning a solo?

08:00.812 --> 08:02.214
ABBY LEE: <i>'Cause she was</i>
<i>the only one dancing!</i>

08:02.214 --> 08:03.715
<i>Your kids were sitting</i>

08:03.715 --> 08:05.450
in a dressing room,
doing nothing!

08:05.450 --> 08:08.553
Abby doesn't need us here
to teach the dance.

08:08.553 --> 08:10.222
<i>She just needs the girls.</i>

08:10.222 --> 08:12.057
<i>And the girls are here.</i>

08:12.057 --> 08:13.692
For Ashlee not to talk
to production

08:13.692 --> 08:17.996
<i>and tell them it's okay</i>
<i>for the girls to dance</i>

08:17.996 --> 08:19.798
is sneaky and conniving

08:19.798 --> 08:21.766
and once again just puts
Brynn in the spotlight.

08:21.766 --> 08:23.101
Let her have the solo time!
Okay. Right.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.769
Right. I‐I just made note

08:24.769 --> 08:27.005
that our kids weren't allowed
to dance, but Brynn was.

08:27.005 --> 08:28.340
ASHLEE: If you guys just
would have shown up,

08:28.340 --> 08:30.041
it wouldn't be an issue, so...

08:30.041 --> 08:32.043
We did. We're here.
Our kids were here.

08:32.043 --> 08:33.445
Everybody, they're raring to go.

08:33.445 --> 08:35.147
We're traveling this week,

08:35.147 --> 08:36.481
and now we're starting late,
and we have

08:36.481 --> 08:37.983
all this stuff to do.
It's kind of, like,

08:37.983 --> 08:39.751
now we have, like,
a day and a half left.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.720
So what is,
what's the plan at this point?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.754
What are you worried about?

08:42.754 --> 08:43.822
Your kid knows her solo.

08:43.822 --> 08:45.524
All this chaos for what?

08:45.524 --> 08:46.992
Whatever you need, Ashlee.

08:46.992 --> 08:47.993
ASHLEE:
<i>I left the girls alone</i>

08:47.993 --> 08:49.528
until their moms could show up.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.329
<i>It is not my fault</i>
<i>that their pajama prank</i>

08:51.329 --> 08:52.631
<i>didn't work.</i>

08:52.631 --> 08:54.132
<i>I totally would've</i>
<i>taken care of the girls</i>

08:54.132 --> 08:56.001
<i>if they would have clued me</i>
<i>into what was going on,</i>

08:56.001 --> 08:57.002
<i>but they didn't.</i>

08:57.002 --> 08:58.537
<i>I just think it's amazing</i>

08:58.537 --> 08:59.838
that Jill turns everything
against me,

08:59.838 --> 09:01.673
and I am so over it.

09:01.673 --> 09:02.807
You're right.

09:02.807 --> 09:05.043
This whole fiasco is my fault

09:05.043 --> 09:06.578
because I was here on time.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.113
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

09:08.113 --> 09:10.015
The moms are so crazy.

09:10.015 --> 09:11.449
They need to stop

09:11.449 --> 09:13.084
<i>the bad behavior,</i>

09:13.084 --> 09:16.321
<i>because the reason</i>
<i>the girls don't win</i>

09:16.321 --> 09:18.056
<i>is because of that crap.</i>

09:18.056 --> 09:20.125
I'm told by production
they can't be on camera.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.626
There's nothing I can do
about it.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.395
You're not a mom,
you're not a dance mom,

09:23.395 --> 09:24.729
you don't care about these kids.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.431
You are (bleep). (bleep).

09:26.431 --> 09:28.967
You're a puppet.
You are pure evil, seriously.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.702
You are the one who said it.
Trying to make me

09:30.702 --> 09:32.237
look as horrible as possible,
all of you.

09:32.237 --> 09:33.305
You do that all yourself.

09:33.305 --> 09:34.940
You know what, you guys can all

09:34.940 --> 09:35.941
go to hell.

09:35.941 --> 09:37.209
You guys didn't come today,

09:37.209 --> 09:38.510
and that's your fault,

09:38.510 --> 09:39.611
not mine.

09:39.611 --> 09:41.546
Oh, go walk away and cry.

09:43.848 --> 09:45.517
It's not my fault, I have
nothing to do with any of this!

09:48.687 --> 09:50.488
ABBY LEE: <i>Coming up</i>
<i>on</i> Dance Moms...

09:50.488 --> 09:51.957
Somehow,
this is all my fault.

09:51.957 --> 09:53.758
This is the worst thing
I've ever had to do.

09:54.926 --> 09:56.228
I always want Kendall

09:56.228 --> 09:57.229
to do a solo.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.597
Interesting.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.465
I feel like I'm not gonna win
this week.

10:01.766 --> 10:03.168
ANNOUNCER:
We have, in third place...

10:20.552 --> 10:22.187
Somehow, this is
all my fault, I guess.

10:22.187 --> 10:23.421
BRYNN:
<i>I'm not really sure</i>

10:23.421 --> 10:25.557
what's going on,
because my mom and I

10:25.557 --> 10:27.626
were the only ones
that showed up this morning.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.127
<i>But I know it's not</i>
<i>my mom's fault.</i>

10:29.127 --> 10:32.130
My mom shouldn't get in trouble
for what the other moms did.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.200
I just think that
no matter what we do,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.568
or how hard we try,

10:36.568 --> 10:38.303
they're always gonna
figure out some way

10:38.303 --> 10:40.972
to make me look bad
or make you look bad,

10:40.972 --> 10:42.574
because they just cannot accept

10:42.574 --> 10:43.875
that there's somebody else good

10:43.875 --> 10:45.310
who's gonna come be
on this team.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.512
So, if you want
to dance, fine,

10:47.512 --> 10:49.347
but this is the worst thing
I've ever had to do.

10:50.882 --> 10:52.717
For dance.
Seriously, this sucks.

10:52.717 --> 10:54.486
So, if you want to stay,
you better work your butt off,

10:54.486 --> 10:55.854
because I'm done.

11:03.228 --> 11:04.796
Okay, girls,

11:04.796 --> 11:06.097
well, here we are again.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.766
It's Wednesday,
it's late.

11:08.733 --> 11:09.734
Uh, and we have a lot

11:09.734 --> 11:12.003
of choreography to get through.

11:12.003 --> 11:15.840
So, I'm not going to dwell
on last week's competition.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.043
You went, the group won.

11:18.043 --> 11:20.045
(jazzy music playing)

11:22.547 --> 11:24.082
I felt that everybody

11:24.082 --> 11:26.284
was good in the group dance.

11:27.485 --> 11:30.322
So, at the bottom
of the pyramid, obviously,

11:30.322 --> 11:32.357
we have Kalani.

11:32.357 --> 11:34.959
Next,

11:34.959 --> 11:36.161
we have Kendall.

11:38.463 --> 11:39.798
Next,

11:39.798 --> 11:40.899
we have Nia.

11:44.035 --> 11:45.870
We have Mackenzie.

11:48.473 --> 11:49.341
We have JoJo.

11:50.342 --> 11:51.242
(chuckles)

11:51.242 --> 11:52.811
All right, now,

11:52.811 --> 11:54.579
this next person...

11:54.579 --> 11:56.147
Brynn.

11:57.449 --> 11:58.616
You would've been up here,

11:58.616 --> 11:59.684
next to Maddie.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.486
But in the group routine,

12:01.486 --> 12:03.254
you're the weak link.

12:03.254 --> 12:04.989
You're dancing was great,

12:04.989 --> 12:08.360
however, it's this.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.362
And, on top of the pyramid,

12:10.362 --> 12:11.996
Maddie.

12:11.996 --> 12:13.531
(applause)

12:13.531 --> 12:14.566
You were excellent

12:14.566 --> 12:15.400
in the duet,

12:15.400 --> 12:16.634
<i>when the music stopped.</i>

12:16.634 --> 12:18.803
(music stops)

12:25.477 --> 12:26.978
You made the decision

12:26.978 --> 12:28.513
to keep dancing.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.548
Brynn followed your lead.

12:30.548 --> 12:33.084
And you did it beautifully.

12:33.084 --> 12:35.019
MADDIE:
<i>It feels great to be back</i>

12:35.019 --> 12:36.654
on the top of the pyramid,

12:36.654 --> 12:38.890
<i>because we did amazing</i>
<i>in the duet.</i>

12:38.890 --> 12:40.558
But I'm surprised Abby
didn't put both of us

12:40.558 --> 12:42.594
<i>at the top of the pyramid,</i>

12:42.594 --> 12:43.795
but I'm fine with that.

12:43.795 --> 12:46.064
Let's get to competition
this week.

12:46.064 --> 12:48.366
This week we're going
a little further.

12:48.366 --> 12:51.469
We will travel
to San Jose, California.

12:51.469 --> 12:53.238
Hey, hey, San Jose!

12:53.238 --> 12:54.272
(laughter)

12:54.272 --> 12:55.807
We will compete

12:55.807 --> 12:57.041
at New York
Dance Experience.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.510
MELISSA:
Oh, we love it there.

12:59.544 --> 13:00.912
ABBY LEE:
It is.

13:00.912 --> 13:02.514
Sometimes I like that‐‐
when I'm sitting there,

13:02.514 --> 13:04.749
and I'm hearing
what they're saying, I like it.

13:04.749 --> 13:07.085
We know that the competition
is going to be fierce.

13:07.085 --> 13:09.687
I don't know if all
of you are ready.

13:09.687 --> 13:11.790
We have three solos this week.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.958
The first solo is going
to Brynn.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.660
(applause)

13:16.895 --> 13:18.296
You were here,
your mother was here.

13:19.564 --> 13:20.932
We started working

13:20.932 --> 13:22.467
on "Black Dahlia."

13:22.467 --> 13:24.102
A famous murder here
in Hollywood.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.572
Maddie, you will be doing
the next solo.

13:27.572 --> 13:29.307
You're creating

13:29.307 --> 13:32.877
a story onstage
about Lizzie Borden.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.246
Now, as legend has it,

13:35.246 --> 13:36.481
Lizzie Borden

13:36.481 --> 13:38.550
killed her mother

13:38.550 --> 13:40.385
with 40 whacks.

13:41.286 --> 13:42.320
With an ax. (clicking)

13:43.588 --> 13:45.356
All right, I have a third solo.

13:45.356 --> 13:46.691
I wouldn't give this solo

13:46.691 --> 13:48.092
to somebody else.

13:48.092 --> 13:50.495
Since we're doing our
tragic Hollywood deaths,

13:50.495 --> 13:53.765
I wanted to do a piece
about Natalie Wood.

13:53.765 --> 13:56.534
And I thought immediately
of Kendall.

13:56.534 --> 13:58.303
(applause)

13:58.303 --> 13:59.070
Why?

13:59.070 --> 14:00.405
Maybe a person that is

14:00.405 --> 14:02.407
more optimistic in life

14:02.407 --> 14:04.742
would see that as a compliment.

14:04.742 --> 14:07.312
"Oh, my God, Abby thinks
that I look like Natalie Wood?

14:07.312 --> 14:08.546
Wow."

14:08.546 --> 14:09.747
That is a compliment.

14:09.747 --> 14:11.349
That‐that is a compliment.

14:11.349 --> 14:12.383
She can see that.

14:12.383 --> 14:13.785
ABBY LEE:
<i>I want to give Kendall</i>

14:13.785 --> 14:15.520
<i>a beautiful solo.</i>

14:15.520 --> 14:17.155
<i>Kendall is a great</i>
<i>group dancer,</i>

14:17.155 --> 14:19.557
but when she's out there
by herself, she chokes.

14:19.557 --> 14:22.026
<i>The Natalie Wood solo</i>
<i>is perfect,</i>

14:22.026 --> 14:23.828
because she's gonna see
that this is a beautiful girl,

14:23.828 --> 14:25.864
and that there's
no drama around here.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.999
Well, not until she died.

14:27.999 --> 14:30.368
I think having a solo
is an honor.

14:30.368 --> 14:31.636
It's a privilege, absolutely.

14:31.636 --> 14:33.004
A privilege.

14:33.004 --> 14:35.707
And it should be
great and good, and...

14:35.707 --> 14:38.510
Yeah, and it should have time
and attention and choreography

14:38.510 --> 14:40.578
and music and costuming,

14:40.578 --> 14:43.248
and I can tell you right now
it won't.

14:43.248 --> 14:45.583
Because it's my child.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.051
Oh, the victim.

14:47.051 --> 14:50.021
You remind me of a tall blonde
I used to know.

14:50.021 --> 14:52.190
I always want Kendall
to do a solo.

14:52.190 --> 14:53.691
But I want Kendall to get

14:53.691 --> 14:55.793
the right amount
of time and attention

14:55.793 --> 14:58.096
that every other kid
in here gets.

14:58.096 --> 14:59.864
Interesting.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.065
Well, do you
think Jill, though,

15:01.065 --> 15:03.167
is more upset the fact
that she's gonna have to

15:03.167 --> 15:04.369
go up against Brynn and Maddie?

15:04.369 --> 15:07.238
Kendall's been competing
against Maddie

15:07.238 --> 15:08.973
For years.
for five or six years now.

15:08.973 --> 15:11.209
That doesn't ever
bother you or you.
Not a problem.

15:11.209 --> 15:13.044
KENDALL: <i>I'm not intimidated</i>
<i>by Maddie and Brynn,</i>

15:13.044 --> 15:15.046
but I know they're gonna get the
full package and the best dance.

15:15.046 --> 15:16.414
<i>So I feel like</i>

15:16.414 --> 15:18.616
I'm not gonna win this week.

15:18.616 --> 15:20.051
The group routine.

15:20.051 --> 15:22.387
Now, I'm planning on everyone
doing the group routine.

15:22.387 --> 15:25.857
Kalani, I got clearance
from your mom last night

15:25.857 --> 15:29.227
that you will, in fact,
be okay to do the group dance.

15:29.227 --> 15:30.628
And I think

15:30.628 --> 15:32.397
we can make you look good,
no matter what.

15:32.397 --> 15:33.665
All right?
Okay.

15:33.665 --> 15:35.667
Okay.
So, Northern California

15:35.667 --> 15:38.736
is more well‐known
for something a little scary.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.305
I think every parent

15:40.305 --> 15:41.539
has concerns

15:41.539 --> 15:42.740
about their child

15:42.740 --> 15:44.776
falling prey to a cult.

15:44.776 --> 15:47.979
And sometimes,
they're even brainwashed

15:47.979 --> 15:49.881
to drink the Kool‐Aid.

15:49.881 --> 15:51.983
The piece is simply titled,

15:51.983 --> 15:53.384
"The Cult."

15:55.620 --> 15:56.521
All right,
let's spread apart, girls.

15:56.521 --> 15:57.522
Let's do something. Come on.

16:03.227 --> 16:04.762
<i>This week, we're traveling</i>
<i>to Northern California,</i>

16:04.762 --> 16:06.331
<i>home place</i>

16:06.331 --> 16:07.699
of many cults.

16:07.699 --> 16:10.602
<i>And I decided to go</i>
<i>with a dark theme,</i>

16:10.602 --> 16:12.670
<i>hence several other</i>
<i>dark pieces.</i>

16:12.670 --> 16:14.872
That looks very cult‐like there.

16:14.872 --> 16:16.774
Get in forced arch,
though, JoJo.

16:16.774 --> 16:18.109
Get your feet up there
in relevé.

16:18.109 --> 16:19.110
You're always flat‐footed.

16:19.110 --> 16:20.311
This routine

16:20.311 --> 16:21.579
is contemporary in style.

16:22.747 --> 16:24.415
But it's called "The Cult."

16:24.415 --> 16:26.050
Already,
people are freaked out.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.419
Just the word "cult" is,
like, taboo.

16:28.419 --> 16:29.887
The stigma with a cult

16:29.887 --> 16:32.090
is that it's bad because
you don't think for yourself.

16:32.090 --> 16:33.291
Someone's thinking for you.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.293
"Here drink this Kool‐Aid
and die."

16:35.293 --> 16:37.695
"Okay, whatever you say."

16:37.695 --> 16:39.330
JESSALYNN:
<i>Wait,</i>

16:39.330 --> 16:40.898
we were kind of
like a cult today.

16:40.898 --> 16:42.300
HOLLY: Yeah, yeah.
ASHLEE:
I think I called you guys

16:42.300 --> 16:43.501
a cult before.

16:43.501 --> 16:44.869
Yeah, I have heard that.

16:44.869 --> 16:46.771

a tough number for our girls.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.220
<i>They lost a full day</i>
<i>of rehearsals.</i>

34:50.220 --> 34:51.988
<i>But if we want to win</i>

34:51.988 --> 34:52.989
this competition,

34:52.989 --> 34:55.759
<i>we need every member on board.</i>

34:55.759 --> 34:57.828
It is time to drink
the ALDC Kool‐Aid.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.432
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

35:02.432 --> 35:04.768
I think it's time we find out
how these kids did.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.703
In second place...

35:12.375 --> 35:13.977
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Small group contemporary,</i>

35:13.977 --> 35:15.312
ages 13 through 14,

35:15.312 --> 35:17.047
number 300, "The Cult."

35:17.047 --> 35:18.482
(cheering)

35:20.517 --> 35:22.052
ABBY LEE: <i>The issue</i>
<i>with the group routine</i>

35:22.052 --> 35:24.054
<i>is going to be their timing.</i>

35:24.054 --> 35:25.222
I just hope
that the girls go out

35:25.222 --> 35:26.389
and give
a nice, clean performance

35:26.389 --> 35:27.624
and that they stay together,

35:27.624 --> 35:29.259
they feel each other
beside them,

35:29.259 --> 35:30.227
<i>like a cult.</i>

35:30.227 --> 35:31.294
<i>If they are on it,</i>

35:31.294 --> 35:32.963
<i>this is gonna be</i>
<i>a great number.</i>

35:32.963 --> 35:35.265
If they're not,
it's gonna be a hot mess.

37:30.881 --> 37:34.584
The opening sequence
was beautiful, you guys.

37:34.584 --> 37:36.553
Great job on the timing
on the floor work.

37:36.553 --> 37:37.821
Another thing that I was really

37:37.821 --> 37:39.890
impressed with was the emotion.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.057
You guys were all there,
emotionally, from the get‐go,

37:41.057 --> 37:42.559
so you guys already
had us vested in

37:42.559 --> 37:43.560
from the very beginning.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.561
Very well done; very pleased.

37:44.561 --> 37:46.263
Good job tonight, you guys.

37:48.265 --> 37:51.201
ABBY LEE:
<i>I thought the judges' critiques</i>
<i>were right on the money.</i>

37:51.201 --> 37:53.036
<i>The group became</i>

37:53.036 --> 37:54.671
those members of the cult.

37:54.671 --> 37:56.940
They were in it to win it,

37:56.940 --> 37:58.575
they were living in the moment,

37:58.575 --> 38:01.311
<i>and nothing backstage,</i>

38:01.311 --> 38:03.713
<i>nothing in the audience,</i>
<i>a baby crying...</i>

38:03.713 --> 38:05.048
<i>nothing distracted them.</i>

38:05.048 --> 38:06.950
That's what made
the piece amazing.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.652
(cheering)

38:08.652 --> 38:10.420
(cheering, applauding)

38:13.089 --> 38:15.759
ANNOUNCER:
How about that,
ladies and gentlemen?

38:15.759 --> 38:17.227
I think it's time we find out

38:17.227 --> 38:19.095
how these kids did.
What do you guys think?

38:19.095 --> 38:20.597
(audience cheering)

38:22.265 --> 38:23.700
All right! Beautiful.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.903
We're gonna start
with our junior soloists.

38:26.903 --> 38:28.638
In third place...

38:29.673 --> 38:31.875
... we have number 174.

38:32.909 --> 38:34.010
In second place,

38:34.010 --> 38:36.780
we have a score of 296.

38:38.882 --> 38:42.452
This is number 303,
"Black Dahlia," Brynn.

38:42.452 --> 38:44.454
Congratulations, Brynn.

38:46.022 --> 38:47.524
JESSALYNN:
<i>Ashlee was so manipulative</i>

38:47.524 --> 38:51.161
in trying to get Brynn a head
start with this solo, but

38:51.161 --> 38:53.229
<i>I have some news for her.</i>

38:53.229 --> 38:56.166
<i>That extra hour you got</i>
<i>with Abby was for nothing.</i>

38:56.166 --> 38:58.335
Brynn got second
and I think it's about time

38:58.335 --> 39:00.503
that Ashlee realizes
that Brynn's not all that.

39:00.503 --> 39:02.138
ANNOUNCER:
Moving on, now, we have

39:02.138 --> 39:03.974
our teen solos.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.542
Can I get a drumroll,
please, audience?

39:05.542 --> 39:07.911
All right, here we go.

39:07.911 --> 39:09.913
In third place,

39:09.913 --> 39:13.750
number 173,
"Rule the World," Julia.

39:13.750 --> 39:14.751
Congratulations!

39:17.988 --> 39:22.325
All right, again, second place
gets a score of 292.

39:23.693 --> 39:25.729
It is number 301,

39:25.729 --> 39:28.131
"The Incredible Natalie Wood,"

39:28.131 --> 39:29.132
by Kendall!

39:29.132 --> 39:30.400
Congratulations, Kendall.

39:32.302 --> 39:33.570
Brynn and Kendall
both got second,

39:33.570 --> 39:35.672
but Brynn had
a much higher score.

39:35.672 --> 39:38.842
And in first place...

39:38.842 --> 39:39.876
This was an unbelievable number.

39:42.679 --> 39:45.215
"Lizzie Borden," Maddie Ziegler,

39:45.215 --> 39:47.517
first place. Congratulations!

39:47.517 --> 39:49.119
Round of applause, gentlemen.

39:49.119 --> 39:50.587
(whooping)

39:50.587 --> 39:52.489
Give them a bow, ladies.

39:53.690 --> 39:55.291
JILL:
<i>You know, I'm proud of Kendall.</i>

39:55.291 --> 39:57.127
The fact that
she's second to Maddie

39:57.127 --> 39:58.628
<i>is fine. You know what?</i>

39:58.628 --> 40:02.132
<i>She was supposed to be</i>
<i>second to Maddie, so...</i>

40:02.132 --> 40:03.166
I'm proud of her.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.135
All right.
It's time for teen groups.

40:05.135 --> 40:07.937
In second place...

40:07.937 --> 40:10.106
with ten points off perfection,

40:10.106 --> 40:12.275
"The Grave" from Cast.

40:12.275 --> 40:13.977
Congratulations to "The Grave."

40:13.977 --> 40:16.179
Drumroll, please.

40:16.179 --> 40:17.547
There we go.

40:17.547 --> 40:22.552
With a score of 297,

40:22.552 --> 40:24.454
first place...

40:27.791 --> 40:29.559
...number 300, "The Cult,"

40:29.559 --> 40:32.629
Abby Lee Dance Company!

40:32.629 --> 40:34.564
(cheering)

40:34.564 --> 40:36.266
Ladies, come on down.

40:36.266 --> 40:39.069
Who choreographed this
beautiful, uh, dance for you?

40:39.069 --> 40:41.538
Abby Lee Miller
and Gianna Martello.

40:41.538 --> 40:44.007
Ladies... unbelievable.

40:44.007 --> 40:45.175
Thank you so much.

40:45.175 --> 40:46.342
JILL:
<i>Even though</i>

40:46.342 --> 40:48.244
I was nervous about the girls

40:48.244 --> 40:49.579
<i>dancing the group dance,</i>

40:49.579 --> 40:52.148
<i>because they lost</i>
<i>a whole day of rehearsal,</i>

40:52.148 --> 40:53.483
they really connected to it.

40:53.483 --> 40:54.751
(cheering)

40:54.751 --> 40:56.953
MELISSA:
Congratulations, Mad!

40:56.953 --> 40:58.221
JILL:
<i>And you know what?</i>

40:58.221 --> 41:00.523
<i>I love when our kids</i>
<i>dance as a team, together.</i>

41:00.523 --> 41:03.426
<i>And I think that's</i>
<i>what's important.</i>

41:03.426 --> 41:05.962
Maybe the ALDC being a cult

41:05.962 --> 41:07.297
isn't a bad thing after all.

41:07.297 --> 41:09.065
I think this is
a cult of winners.

41:09.065 --> 41:10.400
A winner's circle.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.968
You can only be in this cult
if you're a winner.

41:11.968 --> 41:13.470
ASHLEE: Well, that would mean
Brynn would belong in it.

41:13.470 --> 41:15.338
Brynn's always belonged.
It's you.
(laughs)

41:16.372 --> 41:17.340
(Abby Lee whoops)

41:17.340 --> 41:19.008
(laughter)
Girls...

41:19.008 --> 41:20.810
you won the overall.
Congratulations.

41:20.810 --> 41:22.045
Thank you.

41:22.045 --> 41:23.480
You should be
very proud of that,

41:23.480 --> 41:25.281
'cause there was a lot of
groups, a lot of older kids...

41:25.281 --> 41:28.485
Girls, it's time to get
yourselves some pants on.

41:28.485 --> 41:31.221
I have a gift for you guys.

41:31.221 --> 41:32.689
<i>The ALDC is a cult,</i>

41:32.689 --> 41:34.457
and they need
their own Kool‐Aid,

41:34.457 --> 41:35.992
<i>so I got them some.</i>

41:35.992 --> 41:37.494
I think they should drink their
own Kool‐Aid every now and then.

41:37.494 --> 41:38.995
ALL:
Aw...

41:38.995 --> 41:40.497
You guys get
the cult Kool‐Aid.

41:40.497 --> 41:41.831
No, I don't want...
No thanks.
It's the Kool‐Aid!

41:41.831 --> 41:44.634
I guess you'll have to
make me part of the team.

41:44.634 --> 41:45.835
Wait, wait, wait!
Till the toast.

41:45.835 --> 41:48.238
To eight more
overall wins.

41:48.238 --> 41:49.472
ABBY LEE:
Over the lips, under the gums,

41:49.472 --> 41:50.874
look out, stomach,
here it comes.

41:50.874 --> 41:52.942
(laughter)
JESSALYNN:
Is this blood?

41:52.942 --> 41:54.878
I don't want to drink this now.

41:54.878 --> 41:58.681
(laughter)
JOJO: <i>I'll drink it!</i>

41:58.681 --> 42:00.550
‐ Getting the best of someone

42:00.550 --> 42:02.485
isn't always running.

42:02.485 --> 42:04.087
‐ No, I can't do this.

42:04.087 --> 42:06.156
‐ I'm done.
I'm leaving. Good‐bye.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.491
‐ I don't want do it anymore.

42:08.491 --> 42:10.793
‐ You're only as good
as your last performance.

42:10.793 --> 42:13.296
You can't go backwards.

42:13.296 --> 42:16.065
<i>This is a really big week</i>
<i>for us.</i>

42:16.065 --> 42:18.501
<i>This piece can't not win.</i>

42:18.501 --> 42:21.137
<i>You dance 100%.</i>

42:21.137 --> 42:22.272
<i>[all chant]</i>

42:22.272 --> 42:25.642
<i>You give it your all!</i>

42:25.642 --> 42:26.743
<i>The team that's losing...</i>

42:26.743 --> 42:29.145
‐ Yell in front of her
one more time!

42:29.145 --> 42:30.480
<i>‐ That's the team</i>
<i>that's falling apart.</i>

42:30.480 --> 42:31.681
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

42:31.681 --> 42:33.716
‐ Probably enjoy
solitary confinement too.

42:33.716 --> 42:34.918
<i>‐ There's something wrong.</i>

42:34.918 --> 42:36.119
‐ You're trying to make
[bleep] up

42:36.119 --> 42:37.287
to cause drama.

42:37.287 --> 42:40.190
So walk the [bleep] that way.

42:40.190 --> 42:41.791
<i>‐ What have we become?</i>

42:41.791 --> 42:43.326
[groans maniacally]

42:43.326 --> 42:45.328
‐ We're role models.
We're moms.

42:45.328 --> 42:48.097
<i>‐ The moms don't rule</i>
<i>the dance studio, you idiot.</i>

42:48.097 --> 42:50.867
‐ This team is really
too stressful.

42:50.867 --> 42:52.669
<i>‐ I read that "US Weekly"</i>
<i>is reporting</i>

42:52.669 --> 42:55.071
that Maddie is leaving the team.

42:55.071 --> 42:56.706
‐ Melissa, anything to say?

42:56.706 --> 42:59.542
‐ Sorry.

42:59.542 --> 43:01.611
<i>Such a great ride together.</i>

43:01.611 --> 43:03.746
<i>I love you guys so much.</i>
