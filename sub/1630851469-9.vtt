00:09.400 --> 00:11.600
Not many outsiders
understand the Russian mindset.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.000
I'll take a chance with you.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.520
So many of us
have dedicated ourselves to Redback.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.920
If you should let it slip
from your grasp now...

00:18.000 --> 00:19.080
Nothing's slipping.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.960
-What is it?
-The DNA results.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.040
She's not yours?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.480
How am I gonna tell her?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.120
You drugged me!

00:28.200 --> 00:29.560
The day before the explosion,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.280
you walked into the pub
carrying a big, heavy bag.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.920
William Ogilvie gave the order.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.720
Pity to see you go, Katrine.
It really is a terrible waste.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.440
This can't come out
before the referendum.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.600
She has to know.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.040
It'll look as if you manipulated
the whole thing.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.080
We need to keep this between us,
Adam, just for now.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.160
Get in the fucking car.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.120
Shit!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.240
William, she's gone.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.960
What is Redback?

00:53.040 --> 00:54.160
Don't say anything.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.680
I'm giving you
the opportunity to put things right.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.360
Let me show you what your father did.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.960
-No.
-The man is corrupt.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.200
-You killed...
-What else have you done for him?

01:06.280 --> 01:07.320
-You put...
-What else?

01:14.680 --> 01:15.480
Shit.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.240
Shit.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.600
You shot me.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.480
All right, sit on the chair.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.720
Kill me and you'll never know
how to stop Redback.

02:29.840 --> 02:30.640
Tell me.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.880
You're not gonna tell me anything,
are you?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.000
Maybe killing you stops Redback.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.840
Maybe I underestimated
how important you are.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.520
So I pull this trigger
and it's game over.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.640
Okay.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.320
Okay, what?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.160
Let me show you what your father did.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.200
-Oh, no! It's...
-Yes.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.880
The proof is on my phone.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.600
I'll show you and tell you
everything you need to stop Redback.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.280
You don't have anything.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.560
I'm not letting you
get away from this!

03:05.640 --> 03:07.600
He blew up the Skanda pub.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.960
He gave the order
to piggyback Calvin's bomb.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.560
Two detonators. Two bombs.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.280
He blew the place apart...
without a warning.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.640
He made it look
like it was Calvin's screw up.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.040
Bullshit!

03:25.120 --> 03:26.880
Being his handler you screwed up.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.560
Alaric Henderson's confession
is on my phone.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.800
Tell me what Redback is!

03:38.720 --> 03:40.600
Your father killed innocent people.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.520
There.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.520
Beatrice's car coming into shot.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.520
-She's armed.
-But not with a service weapon.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.160
She didn't log one out
from the armory.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.440
That is Katrine at the wheel.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.560
Best way.
Heading south down Cheetham Street.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.760
Comes out on Dover Street.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.880
Want me to check
for underground car parks or garages

05:06.960 --> 05:07.880
in the vicinity?

05:07.960 --> 05:09.560
Not yet. Uh...

05:10.520 --> 05:11.440
Go back.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.520
There.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.880
That road on the left.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.680
It's a one-way street.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.120
Ah, well.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.880
Breaking all the rules now.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.680
Trace the new route.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.840
Let's get them found.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.160
Better let the DG know.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.640
Agent AWOL with a GRU operative.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.640
Well, that'd be her career.
She's not working with Poulsen.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.720
She may have gone rogue,
yeah, but she's our rogue.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.240
No one turns Beatrice Ogilvie.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.120
You're willing to take
your career on that?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.160
One hundred percent.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.840
You can put this right.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.920
I saw what Oleg Adamov did to you.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.680
You didn't see.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.120
You watched.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.200
I saw a man
with his boot on a woman's throat.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.120
He has a hold on you.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.160
Yes, he does.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.560
Okay.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.680
So let's deal.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.600
You tell me what Redback is...

06:27.960 --> 06:30.640
and I'll look
at whatever you've got on your phone.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.640
I'll look at it.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.000
Okay.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.560
"Redback" is a code word.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.520
For what?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.920
For a Russian action in England.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.240
It's complex.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.560
It's devised by the GRU

06:50.240 --> 06:51.120
and...

06:53.680 --> 06:56.400
in the beginning, they didn't think
it would work, but...

06:57.120 --> 06:59.400
To be honest, you made mistakes.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.200
The pieces fell into place.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.720
The first stage began...

07:08.640 --> 07:09.920
You were going to tell her.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.120
I was playing for time.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.480
I would've been dead
before I told her.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.720
-Have you got the worm?
-Yes.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.160
Your orders
could not have been clearer.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.160
Get the worm and bring it to me.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.160
She's got it.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.600
Everything can carry on as planned.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.200
And what are you doing, Gavriil?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.800
She's been shot.
I'm calling the doctor.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.200
-We're fine. You can go now.
-She needs...

07:59.760 --> 08:01.320
I'll handle this from here.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.400
Okay.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.560
You wanted William Ogilvie.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.640
You tried. Fine.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.160
Now let's go back to work.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.960
Yeah, but I'm not done with him.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.600
William will get what's coming.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.880
We are two days away from finishing.
Everything we worked for.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.800
Time to focus, Katrine.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.000
Fine.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.960
Do you want me to stop?

08:52.040 --> 08:53.520
No, for fuck's sake!

09:32.240 --> 09:33.280
<i>It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

09:33.360 --> 09:36.560
<i>and you're watching</i>
The Nation Decides <i>on GMT.</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:42.280
Stand by.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.080
Three, two...

09:46.160 --> 09:48.040
<i>We're live</i>
<i>from the Downing Street press room</i>

09:48.120 --> 09:49.720
<i>for exclusive interviews.</i>

09:49.800 --> 09:52.960
<i>Today is the big day.</i>
<i>The polling stations are open.</i>

09:53.040 --> 09:54.000
<i>By midnight tonight</i>

09:54.080 --> 09:57.080
<i>either Adam Cornwell's United Kingdom</i>
<i>will be whole</i>

09:57.160 --> 10:00.040
<i>or Isla Robson will have</i>
<i>the ambitions of a lifetime</i>

10:00.120 --> 10:01.160
<i>finally realized.</i>

10:01.240 --> 10:02.760
We're ahead in the polls.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.560
Here's the plan.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.240
Don't fuck up. Don't lose.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.840
Put that on a T-shirt,
you'd make a fortune.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.560
<i>Campaigning's over.</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:14.840
<i>Can you kick back and relax?</i>

10:14.920 --> 10:16.120
<i>No, absolutely not.</i>

10:16.200 --> 10:19.200
<i>As soon as this is done,</i>
<i>I'll be back out making my case.</i>

10:19.920 --> 10:22.640
<i>-The polls have you...</i>
<i>-I don't have much faith in polls.</i>

10:23.280 --> 10:25.240
<i>But those</i>
<i>who do have us trailing,</i>

10:25.320 --> 10:28.760
<i>it's only because of the 55-45</i>
<i>home advantage the PM gave himself.</i>

10:28.840 --> 10:31.800
<i>I'm happy to talk to anyone</i>
<i>who hasn't made up their mind.</i>

11:16.400 --> 11:17.200
Dad.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.560
Katrine ambushed me,
knocked me out.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.080
I'm in a warehouse.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.200
<i>57-1SH.</i>

11:23.280 --> 11:24.880
Right. Stay where you are.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.800
I'll get you an ambulance.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.080
<i>Turnout is rumored to be very low.</i>

11:34.160 --> 11:35.880
<i>This means the Yes campaign</i>

11:35.960 --> 11:39.520
<i>would require a Herculean effort</i>
<i>to reverse the swing.</i>

11:43.680 --> 11:46.440
-Are you off to vote?
-Yeah. Thanks for letting me stay.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.000
You are... coming back?

11:50.560 --> 11:51.360
I'd like to.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.320
Good.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.120
It seems silly me asking.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.880
I was wondering
about the DNA results.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.640
As soon as we get them,
you are the first call.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.560
Will you be disappointed
if I'm Adam's daughter?

12:06.640 --> 12:07.760
No.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.280
God, no.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.520
I'd be delighted.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.840
Okay.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.920
See you soon.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.680
Surprised the doctors let you out.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.120
I didn't have a choice.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.160
Is the machine working?

12:45.720 --> 12:46.760
Bought a new one.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.840
Thought it would help with morale.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.280
I thought we were on the same page.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.600
We are.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.480
But you changed the plan.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.240
I reacted to new information.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.640
Oh, I didn't have time to call you.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.640
You gonna tell me what happened?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.520
My father's doing the debrief.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.600
Well, it helps
to get your story straight.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.120
Too late for stories.

13:29.960 --> 13:30.760
Hello?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.440
<i>Holly, hi.</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:34.480
<i>Any clues on how you're voting?</i>

13:34.560 --> 13:35.600
Who is this?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.880
<i>Miriam McFawn, Associated Press.</i>

13:40.040 --> 13:41.960
Well, I'm voting for my dad.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.040
<i>Except he's not your dad.</i>

13:45.880 --> 13:46.680
What?

13:47.280 --> 13:50.320
<i>Sorry, I thought</i>
<i>you'd have been told by now.</i>

13:50.800 --> 13:51.720
Told what?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.720
<i>Well, we've been sent</i>
<i>the DNA results.</i>

13:55.360 --> 13:57.200
<i>Adam Cornwell isn't your father.</i>

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
Well...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.160
I'm fine.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.240
Thanks for asking.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.320
<i>So, what happened?</i>

14:41.880 --> 14:43.800
Where is Katrine Poulsen?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.800
She got away.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.120
We had a strategy.
You sabotaged it. Why?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.440
Why do you think?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Let's follow interview etiquette,
shall we?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.800
My aim was to discover
what Redback is.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.800
And did you?

15:00.280 --> 15:01.120
Nearly.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.400
-I wanted her sitting there, not you.
-She wouldn't have said anything.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.480
Even with a gun to her head,
she doesn't talk.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.720
Does she?

15:15.880 --> 15:17.280
Did you get anything from her?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.360
She's working with the Russians.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.920
Oleg Adamov turned her.
He's her handler.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.960
<i>He killed Torben Jensen.</i>

15:26.440 --> 15:28.040
<i>Gavriil Sergov is involved.</i>

15:29.280 --> 15:30.400
<i>Was he there?</i>

15:31.680 --> 15:34.160
<i>I was trying</i>
<i>to play the two off each other.</i>

15:37.120 --> 15:38.800
Anyway, I turned my back and...

15:40.200 --> 15:42.360
He must be more scared of them
than he is of us.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.360
We need to change that.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.240
<i>Levi,</i>

15:44.720 --> 15:47.880
<i>get a team out... to Sergov's club.</i>

15:48.880 --> 15:51.840
<i>Full building search</i>
<i>and all-service alert on Sergov.</i>

15:51.920 --> 15:52.720
On it.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.680
Why did you stop me last night?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.440
I went to that address,
Alaric Henderson's.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.880
Nobody home.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.560
The door was open.
Signs of a struggle.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.600
Would you like me
to get Forensics on it?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.320
No, I'll do it.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.200
Sir.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.040
Shit!

16:47.720 --> 16:49.640
What was your question?
Why did I stop you?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.000
Didn't the officers...?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.840
The questions they asked,
they weren't exactly across it.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
Special Branch, it's a misnomer.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.040
You called them
to keep me in the building.

17:01.120 --> 17:01.920
Yep.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.600
Why?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.920
I mean, Levi was about to go solo
and I made him bring it to you.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.240
Why did you keep me here?

17:09.960 --> 17:10.760
To protect you.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.880
Do I have to spell it out?
You're my daughter.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.320
You had armed backup.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.000
-I wasn't gonna be in any danger.
-That wasn't the danger.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.280
The Russian plan, I needed to hear it
from Katrine Poulsen's mouth.

17:20.360 --> 17:23.040
And to do that I was prepared
to use methods that are...

17:23.680 --> 17:24.720
high risk.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.960
I wanted to shield you,
safeguard your career.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.840
-That should've been my choice.
-Well, next time it will be.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.120
So, can we...?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.280
You had her in the car.
You had her in the warehouse.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.560
Plenty of time for a chat.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.520
What did she tell you?

17:43.720 --> 17:44.640
Some lies.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.760
Some half-truths.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.720
Some intel, which seemed incredible.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.120
Excuse me.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.200
Yep?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.480
Police were already
at Gavriil Sergov's club.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.920
A follow-up to the drugs raid
that was empty.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.160
As in completely.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.240
Not even light fittings.
Everything gone.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.680
He owns half of St. John's Wood.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.080
Can't be that hard to find.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.760
<i>We all know</i>
<i>that exit polls can be wrong,</i>

18:48.840 --> 18:50.120
<i>but given the Prime Minister</i>

18:50.200 --> 18:53.240
<i>already has what's being referred to</i>
<i>as a home advantage,</i>

18:53.320 --> 18:56.360
<i>requiring 55% of the winning vote,</i>

18:56.440 --> 18:59.720
<i>then we can say</i>
<i>that the Vote Yes campaign is losing.</i>

19:00.360 --> 19:01.240
Not bad.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.600
Maybe missed my calling.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.640
I should have been a doctor.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.640
Thanks.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.600
Why lipstick?

19:16.400 --> 19:17.360
I don't get it.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.680
They thought there is
less chance of it being stolen.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.360
Beatrice had it in her hands
and she didn't even know it.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.040
Playing with fire.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.200
Be careful. You'll get burnt one day.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.680
Like Jelena?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.080
It's not funny.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.560
It's not the way I would have gone.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.200
Beatrice's father gave her up.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.320
No.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.720
Do you have somebody else?

19:55.920 --> 19:56.960
A big fish.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.280
They swam right into our net.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.920
Well, who is it?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.720
You'll meet my catch later.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.360
<i>He gave the order.</i>

20:39.160 --> 20:40.040
<i>Who did?</i>

20:41.240 --> 20:42.400
<i>William.</i>

20:44.440 --> 20:46.640
<i>William Ogilvie gave the order.</i>

20:51.480 --> 20:52.680
Bad news, I'm afraid.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
Word of your escapade
has reached the DG.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.080
Right.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.120
How might that have happened?

21:00.200 --> 21:02.520
No idea.
I have a meeting with him at 4:00.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.360
You'll think of an explanation
to safeguard my career?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.320
How can I explain

21:07.400 --> 21:10.080
that you had Katrine Poulsen
at gunpoint alone

21:10.160 --> 21:11.680
and that she told you nothing?

21:12.440 --> 21:13.640
It wasn't nothing, though.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.240
It was nothing
we didn't already know.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.280
She showed me a clip

21:16.360 --> 21:18.440
of Alaric Henderson
playing piggyback.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.920
So we can have this out
with the DG if you'd prefer.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.720
You see, that was easy, wasn't it?

21:28.320 --> 21:31.840
Right, I'll take responsibility
for this debacle with the DG

21:32.600 --> 21:36.040
and you and I will reconvene
at 6:00 at my place.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.320
And I'll rustle something up.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.240
Perfect.

21:57.760 --> 21:58.600
Etta.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.440
You should know...
this is doing the rounds.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.600
<i>Well, I'm voting for my dad.</i>

22:09.400 --> 22:11.200
<i>Except he's not your dad.</i>

22:12.520 --> 22:13.320
<i>What?</i>

22:13.400 --> 22:16.600
<i>Sorry, I thought</i>
<i>you'd have been told by now.</i>

22:17.320 --> 22:18.360
<i>-Told what?</i>
<i>-Well...</i>

22:18.440 --> 22:19.240
Oh, God.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.920
<i>...we've been sent the DNA results.</i>

22:21.000 --> 22:22.600
<i>Adam Cornwell isn't your father.</i>

22:23.840 --> 22:26.240
You've been sitting
on the DNA results.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.440
It was my call not to tell you.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.720
Why?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.600
So you wouldn't have to lie to her.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.120
I wouldn't have lied.
Why would you assume that?

22:35.200 --> 22:36.200
Sorry.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.360
Holly should've been told
the moment you knew.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.800
We didn't know
the results would leak.

22:39.880 --> 22:40.840
It doesn't matter!

22:40.920 --> 22:44.080
Etta, wait!
Adam's got back-to-back interviews.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.360
He needs to work out
how to respond to this.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.520
Look, please!

22:48.800 --> 22:52.080
I know I fucked up...
but we will deal with this later.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.280
I'm going to call Holly.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.280
Someone round here
needs to be putting her first.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.680
When are we meeting your mole?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.080
Soon.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.000
Shit.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.600
I'd rather have the pain

23:31.680 --> 23:33.960
than a cotton wool feeling
in my head.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.560
When you first talked to me,
you said you'd been where I was.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.480
On the same bridge,

23:46.440 --> 23:48.120
one step away from ending it.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.760
I lied.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.280
I would have spotted a lie.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.600
I lied about the bridge.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.880
It wasn't Copenhagen.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.080
It was Moscow.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.440
And everything else?

24:09.320 --> 24:10.520
Everything else is true.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.680
What put you there?

24:13.320 --> 24:14.120
Tell me.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.000
There's a show called <i>Nord Est.</i>

24:21.840 --> 24:22.880
Very popular.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.240
It says something positive
about my country, for once.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.480
And then October 23rd, 2002, came.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.880
The Chechen rebels stormed a theatre.
Took everybody hostage.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.680
I was three months
into my Special Forces.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.000
Our task was simple.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.360
Free the hostages, kill the Chechens.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.000
You used gas?

24:50.800 --> 24:51.680
VX.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.120
Venomous agent X...

24:55.080 --> 24:56.400
England's finest export.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.800
It did the job.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.840
It killed the rebels.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.480
It also killed
200 innocent civilians...

25:07.480 --> 25:08.760
many of them children.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.360
Lost in guilt.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.320
That's how I find my bridge.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.240
My commanding officer
talked me down.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.120
How?

25:27.320 --> 25:29.120
He saw in me what you see now.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.120
He said, "Russia needs men

25:33.200 --> 25:35.320
who feel the agony
of a wounded motherland."

26:04.080 --> 26:05.520
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Holly.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.640
Thank you for picking up.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.760
<i>Adam is a shit for not telling you.</i>

26:16.800 --> 26:18.280
<i>He didn't tell me either.</i>

26:19.680 --> 26:21.280
<i>I think you already know that.</i>

26:23.000 --> 26:24.680
But if I'm being honest with you...

26:26.400 --> 26:29.160
even if he was your biological dad,

26:29.920 --> 26:31.680
<i>you never would have really had him.</i>

26:33.640 --> 26:35.960
Just the idea of him.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.040
I'm fine. I just wanna be left alone.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.920
-Stop calling.
<i>-Holly, wait.</i>

27:01.160 --> 27:05.240
The insinuation
that I'd use Holly for political gain

27:05.320 --> 27:08.000
is incredibly offensive.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.400
-But...
-No, hang on.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.160
Humans are messy.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.160
They want to believe. They need hope.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.640
For their families.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.440
For their country.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.760
I'm no different.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.840
Please, don't judge people
for hoping.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.520
Thank you, Prime Minister.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.560
Let's return to studio.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.960
<i>It's true that there have been</i>
<i>ups and downs in this campaign.</i>

27:38.040 --> 27:41.760
<i>However, it seems there won't be</i>
<i>any last-minute surprises</i>

27:41.840 --> 27:42.760
<i>this voting day.</i>

27:43.240 --> 27:47.000
<i>Turnout has been low</i>
<i>and the Nos appear to have it.</i>

27:48.800 --> 27:49.800
You seen this poll?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.280
Looks like we're holding up.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.560
You came across as believable.
People said they saw real emotions.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.600
They were real.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.480
Nothing's more important
than sincerity,

28:01.160 --> 28:02.960
and when you've learnt
to fake that...

28:03.040 --> 28:03.920
Etta!

28:05.640 --> 28:07.280
We fucked up. No arguments.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.240
How is Holly?

28:10.200 --> 28:12.080
There is so much
I wanna say to you...

28:13.080 --> 28:15.680
but right now this country
needs your head in the game.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.960
Where are you going?

28:42.440 --> 28:43.280
To meet the person

28:43.360 --> 28:45.520
who's going to give us
independent Scotland.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.640
-Give me a second.
-They want to meet alone.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.480
What?

28:49.560 --> 28:51.040
Who runs who?

28:52.000 --> 28:52.840
Okay.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.200
The truth.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.320
I'm worried about you, Katrine.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.600
Tomorrow
is the most important day of my life

29:00.280 --> 29:01.840
and I can't do it without you.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.920
I need you to rest.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.280
Then bring back some alcohol.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.840
Get better first.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.720
I did what you wanted.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.200
I released the DNA results.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.120
We didn't factor in the Scots.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.440
What?

29:57.360 --> 29:58.960
Their sentimentality.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.640
The Scots don't give a flying fuck
about the Prime Minister's daughter.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.760
So it's a plan B.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.960
I need the tape.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.840
If I do that, they will know
it was recorded in the next room.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.320
They will know it was me.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.520
We'll doctor it, don't worry.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.960
Traffic noise, birdsong.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.000
They'll think it was recorded
from half a mile away.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.600
Adam is my best friend.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.240
Yeah. Okay.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.320
If you prefer, I can make threats.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.800
Your wife is in a spa
tonight with her mother.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.440
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.440
By giving me the tape
you'll be saving their lives.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.800
Does that make you feel better?

30:45.480 --> 30:46.440
Please.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.840
Or maybe...

30:49.840 --> 30:51.520
you should see the footage I've got.

30:52.800 --> 30:57.080
The Black Sea in June,
stunning views.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.360
Holiday of a lifetime...

31:01.280 --> 31:03.360
until something went wrong.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.520
Fuck!

31:27.640 --> 31:32.760
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>"Yes" is on 44% while "No" is on 56%.</i>

31:33.320 --> 31:35.680
<i>Turnout is rumored to be very low.</i>

31:35.760 --> 31:39.960
<i>The sense I'm getting on the street</i>
<i>is that People trust Adam Cornwell.</i>

31:40.040 --> 31:41.880
<i>And they think he's got their backs.</i>

31:44.800 --> 31:46.240
Latest exit polls.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.480
We're going to lose.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.400
I can't help thinking of Dad.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.360
Like I've let him down.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.800
Don't talk shite.

31:57.280 --> 32:00.400
Your dad would be so proud of you.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.440
I know I am.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.560
And the fight's not done yet.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.680
<i>We don't have to lose.</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:12.200
<i>Theoretically...</i>
<i>the voting system could be hacked.</i>

32:13.240 --> 32:15.800
<i>How would you do that?</i>

32:17.400 --> 32:18.520
<i>Digital voting.</i>

32:19.280 --> 32:21.600
<i>There are people who can manipulate.</i>

32:22.560 --> 32:23.400
<i>Really?</i>

32:23.880 --> 32:25.080
<i>It would save lives.</i>

32:26.400 --> 32:27.600
<i>It would save lives?</i>

32:28.640 --> 32:30.760
<i>That was the Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Adam Cornwell,</i>

32:30.840 --> 32:32.800
<i>talking to one</i>
<i>of his special advisers</i>

32:32.880 --> 32:35.480
<i>about the possibility</i>
<i>of faking the referendum results.</i>

32:35.560 --> 32:36.640
Jesus!

32:37.200 --> 32:38.400
Well, this is massive.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.040
<i>...Davis to talk about the impact...</i>

32:43.280 --> 32:45.200
Tell me that's
another deep-fake recording.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.560
Friend or foe?

33:04.640 --> 33:05.640
It's me.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.560
Friend or foe?

33:08.440 --> 33:09.360
Let me in.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.840
Take a pew.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.520
<i>He gave the order.</i>

33:35.400 --> 33:36.320
<i>Who did?</i>

33:37.600 --> 33:38.560
<i>William.</i>

33:40.520 --> 33:42.640
<i>William Ogilvie gave the order.</i>

33:52.040 --> 33:53.120
He's obviously drugged.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.520
He's telling a Russian agent
what she wants to hear.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.800
Oh, come on. Seriously.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.600
I'm not wearing a wire.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.160
This house is your fortress.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.080
Can we please be honest
with each other?

34:03.640 --> 34:07.040
Honest? Says the girl who rescued
a Russian spy and won't tell me why.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.760
I did it because I don't trust you.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.240
So, what do you want?

34:17.480 --> 34:20.240
I just want us to have
a straightforward conversation.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.960
Like... like we've never had.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.640
Well, as Daddy and his little girl,
obviously, we can do that,

34:25.720 --> 34:28.280
but as members
of Military Intelligence, Section 5,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.720
that's not an option, is it?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.520
We don't do it as either.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.760
What was your role
in the Skanda bombing?

34:40.240 --> 34:42.840
Did you plan it?
Did...? What...? Did you okay it?

34:43.560 --> 34:44.880
Turned a blind eye? What?

34:45.840 --> 34:47.840
What I did and didn't do...

34:50.040 --> 34:51.160
Events occur.

34:51.240 --> 34:54.400
My relationship to them
is always opaque.

34:54.480 --> 34:57.520
As my old FRU commander
used to say, "Cast no shadow."

34:58.880 --> 35:02.320
You killed people
who you vowed to protect!

35:04.200 --> 35:07.200
No, I vowed to protect the union.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.520
The union consists

35:08.600 --> 35:11.200
of considerable more
than 11 bystanders.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.880
So, that's your defense?
That the end justifies the means?

35:13.960 --> 35:16.840
I don't need a defense.
There's no proof.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.640
You're being manipulated
by an enemy agent

35:22.720 --> 35:25.640
who even now
has her own terror plan,

35:25.720 --> 35:28.160
which you have been working
around the clock to thwart

35:28.240 --> 35:31.880
and which has claimed the lives
of your boss and two of your agents.

35:31.960 --> 35:35.000
Did you not stop for a moment
to think about how I might feel

35:35.080 --> 35:38.080
thinking that I was responsible
for the deaths of those 11 people?

35:38.160 --> 35:40.400
Oh, for God's sake! Beatrice!

35:40.480 --> 35:42.160
Will you ever grow up?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.480
I'm trying to protect you.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.480
All of you.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.640
Everybody. The Service.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.880
That's what I do.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.440
You can step into a court of law
and say that you know nothing.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.680
That's what I do for you.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.080
What do you want, Beatrice?

36:02.840 --> 36:04.560
I thought I wanted you to admit it.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.480
I thought that...

36:06.720 --> 36:08.280
I thought if you talked through it

36:08.360 --> 36:10.120
and you made me understand,
then I...

36:13.520 --> 36:14.800
Then I wouldn't hate you.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.680
First of all, Shavonne,

36:24.320 --> 36:27.040
as we speak,
a police investigation is underway

36:27.120 --> 36:31.160
into what amounts to a serious breach
within Downing Street.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.040
Prime Minister...

36:32.120 --> 36:34.760
But, most importantly,
let me be clear,

36:35.600 --> 36:38.760
I would never contemplate
rigging an election.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.160
Is it you on the recording?

36:42.480 --> 36:46.360
Miss Fosterlines
makes an off-the-cuff remark.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.080
<i>More tongue in cheek than anything.</i>

36:48.160 --> 36:51.880
<i>Which you, on the tape...</i>
<i>you then entertain.</i>

36:52.360 --> 36:53.560
<i>What you don't hear,</i>

36:53.640 --> 36:55.600
<i>because the recording</i>
<i>has been cut off,</i>

36:55.680 --> 36:58.640
<i>is the part</i>
<i>where I categorically close it down.</i>

36:59.560 --> 37:00.880
<i>-Prime Minister, sure...</i>
<i>-This</i>

37:01.440 --> 37:05.120
<i>is a blatant attempt</i>
<i>to defy democracy.</i>

37:05.200 --> 37:06.280
Whoever did this

37:06.360 --> 37:08.800
edited a private conversation
for their own agenda,

37:09.280 --> 37:14.840
deliberately and maliciously
withholding the part where I say no.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.120
Surely you understand
why people are outraged.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.920
I'm appealing
to the people of Scotland right now.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.960
<i>This is an attempt to discredit me.</i>

37:26.040 --> 37:26.960
<i>Plain and simple.</i>

37:28.040 --> 37:32.760
<i>I urge you to look into your hearts</i>
<i>and believe me when I say</i>

37:34.080 --> 37:36.400
<i>I would never go</i>
<i>against the democracy</i>

37:36.480 --> 37:40.080
<i>that I have spent my entire career</i>
<i>trying to defend.</i>

37:43.240 --> 37:44.560
<i>I'm asking you to trust me.</i>

37:45.760 --> 37:49.080
We are stronger together.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.680
And there you have it,

37:53.760 --> 37:57.000
the Prime Minister's final words
for this evening.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.640
At Warrenpoint,
I saw a man cut in two.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.320
Second IRA bomb. Young squaddie.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.920
One of 18 killed that day.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.080
And I still see him.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.320
Legs gone.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.440
Holding out his arms,
begging for help.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.480
I take his hand and I swear to him

38:20.480 --> 38:24.240
that what he fought for
I will fight for.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.920
With every breath
I will fight and we will never lose.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.120
If the union dies,

38:33.840 --> 38:36.200
that young man's sacrifice
is for nothing.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.080
Nations are fragile.

38:43.600 --> 38:48.640
Holding them together
takes strength and courage.

38:50.520 --> 38:51.880
And self-sacrifice.

38:57.320 --> 39:01.320
You don't get to be the rogue agent
and the one in charge.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.720
You've got too much power
to act like a mercenary.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.120
Katrine Poulsen...

39:08.720 --> 39:09.720
What about her?

39:09.800 --> 39:11.760
She's out there somewhere...

39:13.840 --> 39:15.800
with a stone-cold assassin.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.680
Redback's still in play.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.120
You could have stopped it.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.560
You had her.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.680
Katrine Poulsen and Gavriil Sergov
in the same room...

39:34.640 --> 39:35.840
and you have nothing.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.040
I have to take this.

39:50.960 --> 39:51.760
Yeah.

39:53.720 --> 39:54.520
Right.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.480
I wasn't going to.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.080
They said they had to...

40:03.440 --> 40:05.160
talk you off a bridge.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.800
Mum used to say...

40:15.000 --> 40:17.400
"Don't lie to me
'cause I can see right through you."

40:18.080 --> 40:19.320
So I never did.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.760
Even when it got me into trouble.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.360
Why did she lie to me?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.840
Holly,

40:30.440 --> 40:32.440
she was trying to protect you.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.560
Who's gonna protect me now?

40:40.720 --> 40:42.720
You have got your friends.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.680
Everything is gonna be okay.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.520
Things will never be the same again.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.560
Come here.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.600
<i>As night falls, voters are determined</i>

41:05.680 --> 41:07.880
<i>to get out</i>
<i>and make their voice heard.</i>

41:07.960 --> 41:10.880
<i>Reports from polling stations</i>
<i>up and down the country</i>

41:10.960 --> 41:12.200
<i>suggest that more people</i>

41:12.280 --> 41:16.440
<i>have arrived to vote in the last hour</i>
<i>than the whole of the day so far.</i>

41:17.440 --> 41:20.840
<i>We are looking</i>
<i>at an unprecedented turnout.</i>

41:21.720 --> 41:25.200
<i>And I'm now being told</i>
<i>that we can go live to Edinburgh,</i>

41:25.280 --> 41:28.160
<i>where it seems</i>
<i>the party has already started.</i>

41:29.200 --> 41:32.080
<i>Voters are taking to the streets</i>
<i>in their droves</i>

41:32.160 --> 41:33.440
<i>filming themselves</i>

41:33.520 --> 41:35.720
<i>eager to document</i>
<i>their independence vote.</i>

41:44.520 --> 41:45.360
Adam.

41:55.320 --> 41:59.920
<i>Tonight the streets of Scotland</i>
<i>are alive with cries of freedom.</i>

42:00.000 --> 42:00.840
<i>Exit polls suggest</i>

42:00.920 --> 42:03.440
<i>this will be a humiliating defeat</i>
<i>for the Prime Minister</i>

42:03.520 --> 42:05.160
<i>and some would say deservedly so.</i>

42:05.760 --> 42:08.120
<i>I must say I've seen</i>
<i>some astonishing sights today...</i>

42:08.200 --> 42:09.760
I did not see that coming.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.520
William's gonna lose his shit.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.520
The Scots have spoken.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.720
But nobody could understand
what they said.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.760
Has anyone seen Beatrice?

42:18.840 --> 42:21.200
She said she was having dinner
at her dad's.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.080
What do you think this means for us?

42:26.400 --> 42:27.480
We're on our own.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.200
What about those people now?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.640
The ones you killed.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.600
<i>Exit polls now indicate</i>

42:41.680 --> 42:44.320
<i>an overwhelming victory</i>
<i>for Isla Robson.</i>

42:44.400 --> 42:47.200
<i>She's done what her father couldn't</i>
<i>and what many leaders...</i>

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
Dad?

42:48.360 --> 42:50.120
<i>To say the PM</i>
<i>gave her a helping hand</i>

42:50.200 --> 42:52.160
<i>would be a bit of an understatement.</i>

42:52.240 --> 42:54.920
<i>But that's for the UK to deal with</i>
<i>because as of tonight</i>

42:55.400 --> 42:58.360
<i>Scotland begins a transition</i>
<i>to independence.</i>

43:09.600 --> 43:10.760
I think you've done it!

43:10.840 --> 43:12.320
Oh, I could cry.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.120
That'll have to wait.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.040
Transfer of power at midnight.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.880
The troops want a speech
that'll blow their bloody roof off.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.640
That's what they're going to get.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.800
-Slange Var.
-Slange Var.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.560
Independence.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.240
Independent Scotland.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.040
God, we're going to do so much.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.760
A nation once again, Dad.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.160
A nation once again.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.560
The Prime Minister
that broke up the United Kingdom.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
That's my legacy.

44:04.800 --> 44:05.960
I'll have to step down.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.880
You've been a good PM.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.240
The Party will see you right.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.520
The Party will see me right.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.520
Find a berth for me
in the House of Lords.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.720
Earn 300 quid for sleeping all day.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.520
<i>We are witnessing</i>
<i>an incredible scene.</i>

44:39.400 --> 44:41.200
If what you did,
you did for the union,

44:41.280 --> 44:44.280
well, it's done now,
so you can be honest with me.

44:48.920 --> 44:51.080
The only person you're protecting
is yourself.

44:52.040 --> 44:53.600
-Where are you going?
-Home.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.680
Work, I don't know.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.880
What will you say
when you get there?

45:07.200 --> 45:08.560
I don't want you to go.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.920
That's mine.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.400
We'll discuss this in the morning.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.400
Dad...

45:20.400 --> 45:21.200
Dad.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.160
Dad?

45:25.560 --> 45:26.360
Dad!

45:27.520 --> 45:28.360
Dad!

45:29.200 --> 45:30.000
Dad!

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
Dad!

45:33.920 --> 45:34.720
Dad!

45:37.360 --> 45:40.760
<i>Our newly won independence</i>
<i>offers freedom,</i>

45:40.840 --> 45:43.320
<i>but with that freedom</i>
<i>there comes a challenge.</i>

45:47.000 --> 45:49.280
The Scottish referendum was stolen.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.320
Get your bots-blitzing social media

45:51.400 --> 45:53.320
with stories
discrediting this result.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.400
That's not their job.
We're not Russia.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.040
We soon will be!

45:57.120 --> 45:59.720
<i>What you do today</i>
<i>changes Europe for ever.</i>

46:00.320 --> 46:04.240
I've commissioned a judicial inquiry
into you and your department.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.120
<i>Redback, 1,000 to 1 shot,</i>
<i>but here we are.</i>

46:08.880 --> 46:11.160
<i>We insert the USB, type in the code,</i>

46:11.240 --> 46:12.880
<i>three minutes to upload</i>
<i>and get out.</i>

46:12.960 --> 46:14.040
You set me up.

46:14.120 --> 46:14.960
Sorry?

46:15.040 --> 46:17.280
Do you think I was shocked
when the tape surfaced?

46:17.360 --> 46:20.320
-The country's at a crossroads.
-Spare me the speech!

46:20.400 --> 46:22.360
Why are you so incapable of change?

46:23.560 --> 46:25.520
I need to speak
to the Minister of Energy!

46:25.600 --> 46:26.960
So get him out of the meeting!

46:27.040 --> 46:28.760
Let's take this now to the police!

46:28.840 --> 46:32.160
Well, obviously,
I can't let you do that now, can I?

46:32.240 --> 46:35.360
-Because you know that you'll lose!
-Because we're at war!

46:35.440 --> 46:36.400
William Ogilvie.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.640
I'll help you get him.

46:38.320 --> 46:42.200
