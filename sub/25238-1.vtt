Hey, sweetie.

05:17.624 --> 05:19.459
Thanks for the ride.

05:38.354 --> 05:39.853
When I said you gotta
start getting out,

05:39.855 --> 05:41.814
I didn't mean babysitting.

05:41.816 --> 05:43.691
Some of us need money.

05:43.693 --> 05:45.735
Money's just
something you buy shit with.

05:45.737 --> 05:49.612
Says the girl
in daddy's $40,000 SUV.

05:49.614 --> 05:50.989

in your mouth ♪

06:08.967 --> 06:10.217
Who's that?

06:10.219 --> 06:11.802
Baby brother.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.804
He's 15 years old and
he's sitting at home

06:13.806 --> 06:16.389
chatting with a bunch
of cyber strangers about

06:16.391 --> 06:18.975
spooky spirits and
the great beyond.

06:18.977 --> 06:20.936
Nice Saturday night.

06:20.938 --> 06:22.440
You should talk.

06:36.828 --> 06:38.828
Didn't we
turn at that sign last time?

06:38.830 --> 06:40.081
I don't know.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.415
Well, who the fuck
interviews twice

06:41.417 --> 06:43.333
for a babysitting job, anyway?

06:43.335 --> 06:45.085
In the middle of
nowhere, I might add.

06:45.087 --> 06:47.129
I got
the job, didn't I?

06:47.131 --> 06:48.672
Whatever.

06:48.674 --> 06:51.759
Now that it's official, they
can pay for my fucking gas.

06:51.761 --> 06:53.095
It's up there.

07:09.112 --> 07:11.403
Text you to pick me up later?

07:11.405 --> 07:12.237
Maybe.

07:12.239 --> 07:15.575
Thanks Cali.

07:52.864 --> 07:53.903
Ranae.

07:53.905 --> 07:55.155
You scared me.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.994
Sorry about the
wait, come on in.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.997
Tanya just put the baby down.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.499
He's already in bed?

08:05.501 --> 08:07.626
Three months old and all he
does is eat and poop and sleep

08:07.628 --> 08:09.836
and he's already
eaten and pooped so,

08:09.838 --> 08:11.881
you should have a
pretty easy night.

08:11.883 --> 08:13.715
That's amazing.

08:13.717 --> 08:14.799
Oh, hi, Ranae.

08:14.801 --> 08:16.552
You found the house okay?

08:16.554 --> 08:18.095
Probably a little
harder in the dark.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.388
My friend Cali dropped me off.

08:19.390 --> 08:20.681
Oh, that's nice.

08:20.683 --> 08:21.891
If you would need
a ride home later,

08:21.893 --> 08:22.891
Roman can take you.

08:22.893 --> 08:23.850
Cali will pick me up.

08:23.852 --> 08:25.352
Perfect!

08:25.354 --> 08:29.189
But if you need a
ride, of course, I can.

08:29.191 --> 08:30.691
What are you
guys doing tonight?

08:30.693 --> 08:32.068
Just dinner and a late movie.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.986
It's our anniversary this week.

08:33.988 --> 08:34.904
Happy anniversary.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.863
An excuse to go out, anyway.

08:36.865 --> 08:38.491
You guys don't get out much?

08:38.493 --> 08:42.953
You are, actually,
Miller's first babysitter.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.914
Okay, well,
Miller's not gonna wake up,

08:44.916 --> 08:45.747
but if he does...

08:45.749 --> 08:46.748
He won't.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.125
But if he does...

08:48.127 --> 08:49.794
But if he does.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.213
Diaper and wipes are on the
changing table in the nursery.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.048
His bottle's in the fridge.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.424
He likes the white
noise machine,

08:55.426 --> 08:57.133
so you can just leave that on

08:57.135 --> 08:58.968
and there's a monitor
here on the tablet.

08:58.970 --> 08:59.804
We should
get going, honey.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.304
Ah, what else?

09:01.306 --> 09:03.015
Oh, there's chicken in the
fridge if you're hungry.

09:03.017 --> 09:04.224
You can just nuke it.

09:04.226 --> 09:06.394
Soda and stuff by
the bar downstairs.

09:06.396 --> 09:07.560
Snacks everywhere and...

09:07.562 --> 09:10.231
And a couch, bathroom,
doors, the works.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.649
Okay, I get it.

09:11.651 --> 09:12.900
I get it.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.234
I'm just gonna go check
on him one more time.

09:14.236 --> 09:16.194
We'll be late.

09:16.196 --> 09:18.405
Okay, it'll be fine.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.907
The movie won't
be done 'til after midnight,

09:20.909 --> 09:22.992
but we'll be home by
one at the latest.

09:22.994 --> 09:26.539
Call or text if you have
questions or need anything.

09:26.541 --> 09:27.415
You know, I'm just...

09:27.417 --> 09:28.665
I'll be real quick,

09:28.667 --> 09:31.712
I'm just gonna check

I'm bored,
entertain me.

13:24.653 --> 13:27.445
Your Snap
scared the crap out of me.

13:27.447 --> 13:30.031
I was having the weirdest dream.

13:30.033 --> 13:31.032
Sleeping
on the job already?

13:31.034 --> 13:32.159
That's impressive.

13:32.161 --> 13:33.955
What are you doing?

13:35.163 --> 13:37.622
Saturday night
in Disfunction Junction.

13:37.624 --> 13:38.582
Grace and J?

13:39.835 --> 13:41.084
Shit!

13:41.086 --> 13:43.420
I told you to fucking
knock it off, baby dick.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.630
Hey, I'll hit you back in five.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.193
Sorry about that.

16:52.195 --> 16:53.819
J is such an asshole.

16:53.821 --> 16:55.529
What the hell was that?

16:55.531 --> 16:57.405
I said sorry.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.824
That picture, what was
that picture suppose to be?

16:59.826 --> 17:01.285
What picture?

17:01.287 --> 17:03.286
That picture you just sent me.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.621
What picture?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.874
That sick picture.

17:06.876 --> 17:09.876
I have zero idea
what you're talking about.

17:09.877 --> 17:11.752
I can't
believe you'd do this.

17:11.755 --> 17:13.630
Sweetie, I
didn't send you anything.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.217
This isn't funny.

17:16.675 --> 17:19.386
You sound really
freaked, should I come over?

17:19.387 --> 17:20.637
No.

17:20.638 --> 17:21.887
I think I should.

17:21.890 --> 17:23.223
No!

17:23.224 --> 17:24.558
I'm going to.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.438
Don't.

19:57.379 --> 19:58.214
Jesus.

20:17.108 --> 20:19.609
Surprise!

20:24.907 --> 20:27.076
There's no beer in here!

20:29.328 --> 20:30.493
What he say?

20:30.495 --> 20:32.163
I have no idea.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.749
I said there's
no beer in the fridge.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.416
Stop yelling, Jeremy.

20:36.418 --> 20:38.668
The baby's sleeping.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.087
Relax.

20:40.089 --> 20:41.672
The baby's room's
like six miles away.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.965
This place is fucking huge.

20:43.967 --> 20:44.924
Well, if
you wake him up,

20:44.926 --> 20:46.135
you can get him back to sleep.

20:46.137 --> 20:47.761
Oh, sorry, I don't
take care of kids.

20:47.763 --> 20:48.596
I just make 'em.

20:48.598 --> 20:49.763
Get off.

20:49.765 --> 20:51.473
Yeah, you're a real man, J.

20:51.475 --> 20:53.768
Now, tell us about the
time the cop made you cry.

20:54.978 --> 20:56.604
Hey, I wasn't fucking crying.

20:56.606 --> 20:57.480
That dick used pepper spray.

20:59.567 --> 21:00.857
Besides, if a baby
wakes up crying

21:00.859 --> 21:02.443
you just let it cry
itself back to sleep.

21:02.445 --> 21:03.778
Everybody knows that.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.864
Yeah, illegitimate
father of the year.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.949
That's my man.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.202
Honestly, guys, I
love you for coming over,

21:11.204 --> 21:12.787
but you shouldn't be here.

21:12.789 --> 21:15.080
If the Belascos come
home, they'll freak out.

21:15.082 --> 21:16.499
What do they care?

21:16.501 --> 21:19.251
They're
nervous types, believe me.

21:19.253 --> 21:20.961
Hmm. Gracey will charm 'em.

21:20.963 --> 21:22.546
Or at least the dad.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.839
Wouldn't be the
first dad I've charmed.

21:24.841 --> 21:26.674
Slut.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.510
You love it.

21:27.512 --> 21:28.886
Guys.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.512
Honey, you were so
scared on the phone.

21:30.514 --> 21:32.348
I don't think you
should be here alone.

21:32.350 --> 21:33.598
I was freaked out

21:33.600 --> 21:34.849
because of that stupid
picture you sent me.

21:34.851 --> 21:35.975
I didn't
send you anything.

21:35.977 --> 21:37.728
I saw what I saw.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.146
It came from you.

21:39.148 --> 21:43.733
Who else would send
something from your phone?

21:43.735 --> 21:44.984
Fuck you guys.

21:44.986 --> 21:46.611
No, nobody had my phone.

21:46.613 --> 21:48.446
I had it on me the whole night.

21:48.448 --> 21:49.656
What was it?

21:49.658 --> 21:50.700
Dick shot?

21:50.702 --> 21:51.826
Shut up.

21:51.828 --> 21:53.993
Lighten the fuck up.

21:53.995 --> 21:56.454
It was just a
stupid, nasty picture.

21:56.456 --> 21:58.331
I didn't send it.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.834
Then who did?

21:59.836 --> 22:02.502
Someone with a
sick sense of humor.

22:02.504 --> 22:04.754
How would I even
get her phone?

22:04.756 --> 22:06.924
I was playing hockey with
my brother the whole time.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.134
Yeah, glamorous Saturday night

22:08.136 --> 22:11.177
with the video game goontards.

22:11.179 --> 22:14.598
That's the price you pay,
baby, to play with the python.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.392
God!

22:16.394 --> 22:19.686
You're disgusting, not
to mention, delusional.

22:19.688 --> 22:22.606
Yeah, you would know.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.693
Can we scroll past the
Facebook memory moments, please?

22:25.695 --> 22:27.360
Jealous.

22:27.362 --> 22:28.155
I love it.

22:33.535 --> 22:35.453
Guys, really.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.289
It's fine.

22:37.247 --> 22:39.874
I'm fine, it's just

22:39.876 --> 22:42.167
I don't wanna piss
off the Belascos.

22:42.169 --> 22:43.376
We'll leave by midnight

22:43.378 --> 22:44.878
and they won't know
the difference.

22:44.880 --> 22:45.715
Cool?

22:46.882 --> 22:49.716
That's fine.

22:49.718 --> 22:51.176
Great.

22:51.178 --> 22:52.595
Finally, now where's the beer?

22:52.597 --> 22:54.262
You're not
drinking their beer.

22:54.264 --> 22:55.723
Oh, you are such a hero.

22:55.725 --> 22:58.893
You're not babysitting
the fucking beer, ya know?

22:58.895 --> 22:59.979
Movie time?

23:12.699 --> 23:14.034
Ah, my friend.

23:15.285 --> 23:18.203
Our theory of
glandular stimulation

23:18.205 --> 23:21.790
through electricity
pulses was correct.

23:21.792 --> 23:25.921
A few days ago, you were
small as your companion.

23:27.756 --> 23:29.424
And now, look at you.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.807
Why are we watching this?

23:37.809 --> 23:39.392
Because
it's a classic.

23:39.394 --> 23:41.434
Classically stupid maybe.

23:41.436 --> 23:43.104
Because the other
thing he wanted to watch

23:43.106 --> 23:45.397
was even stupider.

23:45.399 --> 23:47.817
It's more stupid.

23:47.819 --> 23:50.319
I didn't realize
this was English 101.

23:50.321 --> 23:53.614
That's because you
didn't pass English 101.

23:53.616 --> 23:56.282
I'm not going to
school for blogging.

23:57.744 --> 23:58.786
I think I'm
actually getting more stupid

23:58.788 --> 24:00.287
from this conversation.

24:00.289 --> 24:03.832
Actually, I think stupider
was right in the first place.

24:03.834 --> 24:04.668
Ha!

24:06.378 --> 24:07.293
Tell me
you don't think

24:07.295 --> 24:08.378
you're gonna smoke in here?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.629
Come on.

24:09.631 --> 24:10.465
Grace!

24:12.260 --> 24:16.177
Fine, I'll go outside.

24:16.179 --> 24:18.138
I'll go with you.

24:18.140 --> 24:19.808
You want
us to pause the movie?

24:21.476 --> 24:22.976
Oh, yeah!

24:22.978 --> 24:25.354
Make sure I don't miss a
minute of this piece of shit.

24:32.863 --> 24:36.156
Don't these people
believe in neighbors?

24:36.158 --> 24:39.201
I think there are a few
more houses around, but

24:39.203 --> 24:41.494
it's pretty spread out.

24:41.496 --> 24:44.290
I'd go crazy out here
in the middle of nowhere.

24:44.292 --> 24:46.834
It's pretty
during the day.

24:46.836 --> 24:48.253
Uh-huh.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.963
There's a path through
there that they showed me.

24:51.965 --> 24:55.300
It's suppose to be
good for hiking.

24:55.302 --> 24:56.137
A creek.

25:02.351 --> 25:03.352
Thrilling.

25:20.828 --> 25:22.703
Did you see that?

25:22.705 --> 25:23.578
See what?

25:23.580 --> 25:24.873
By the trees.

25:29.712 --> 25:31.878
Yeah, gorgeous.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.547
No, right in
front of the trees.

25:33.549 --> 25:34.801
What?

25:37.177 --> 25:41.472
I could have
sworn I saw something.

25:44.519 --> 25:47.105
I don't see anything.

26:00.534 --> 26:02.367
Yeah, you're right.

26:02.369 --> 26:04.371
I guess I didn't either.

26:06.456 --> 26:07.915
Come on.

26:07.917 --> 26:12.001
Let's go back in before Cali
and J kill each other.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.422
Yeah.

26:14.424 --> 26:15.839
Midnight?

26:15.841 --> 26:18.591
Oh, there ain't no use in
waiting around here any longer.

26:18.593 --> 26:20.136
This must be the bats night off.

26:21.973 --> 26:23.055
Oh, wait, wait.
This is the best part.

26:23.057 --> 26:24.142
Watch, watch.

26:27.645 --> 26:28.435
Did you hear that?

26:28.437 --> 26:29.272
Yeah.

26:33.775 --> 26:35.358
Oh, that was
the best part, hold on.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.654
Get
that camera ready!

26:38.656 --> 26:40.196
He tries to
take a picture of it

26:40.198 --> 26:41.031
before it gets him.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.451
Wait, just watch.

26:48.957 --> 26:49.706
This
is the best part.

26:49.708 --> 26:50.624
Watch, watch.

26:50.626 --> 26:51.751
Do you ever shut up?

26:51.753 --> 26:52.960
What is your problem?

26:52.962 --> 26:54.294
You make us watch
this idiot movie,

26:54.296 --> 26:56.004
then you yammer away
the minute it starts.

26:56.006 --> 26:57.088
So?

26:57.090 --> 26:59.008
It's an awful movie.

26:59.010 --> 27:00.259
What I'm not letting
you enjoy it?

27:00.261 --> 27:01.092
Is that what you're saying?

27:02.554 --> 27:03.471
He does the
same thing in the theater.

27:03.473 --> 27:05.308
That is so annoying.

27:11.813 --> 27:13.938
Tell me about it.

27:13.940 --> 27:15.066
People who talk
in movie theaters

27:15.068 --> 27:17.570
should be fucking shot onsite.

27:21.823 --> 27:23.240
Hey, baby brother.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.033
How's babysitting?

27:25.035 --> 27:26.827
Hmm, the usual.

27:26.829 --> 27:28.495
I can't believe you broke
away from the geek world

27:28.497 --> 27:30.246
just to check-up on me.

27:30.248 --> 27:31.665
This is the computer age,

27:31.667 --> 27:32.916
I can do both.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.335
What's up?

27:34.337 --> 27:35.502
Uh, not much.

27:35.504 --> 27:36.796
Grandma and Grandpa
wanted to know

27:36.798 --> 27:39.005
if you're coming home
for Thanksgiving.

27:39.007 --> 27:40.508
Utah isn't home.

27:40.510 --> 27:41.759
You know what they mean.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.719
You didn't come for
the memorial service.

27:43.721 --> 27:45.011
I know.

27:45.013 --> 27:46.680
It's been
a long time, Ranae.

27:46.682 --> 27:48.223
I know, Ray.

27:48.225 --> 27:49.265
Why's it so dark in there?

27:49.267 --> 27:50.518
I can barely see you.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.310
We're just watching a movie.

27:52.312 --> 27:53.270
We?

27:53.272 --> 27:54.439
Is Cali there?

27:55.899 --> 27:57.524
Hey, sexy.

27:57.526 --> 27:59.359
When are you gonna visit again?

27:59.361 --> 28:00.860
I don't know.

28:00.862 --> 28:02.780
Don't
make me beg, stud.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.449
And that's
Grace and Jeremy.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.533
Hey, Ranae's brother.

28:06.535 --> 28:07.702
What's up?

28:07.704 --> 28:08.620
Hi.

28:09.914 --> 28:12.373
Are you having fun
with your virtual BFFs?

28:12.375 --> 28:14.125
You forgot someone.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.042
Oh, you have
real friends, too?

28:16.044 --> 28:18.378
No, you forgot to
introduce me to someone.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.130
What are you talking about?

28:20.132 --> 28:21.507
Who's the other girl?

28:21.509 --> 28:22.883
What other girl?

28:22.885 --> 28:24.719
The girl standing behind you.

28:28.683 --> 28:29.723
That's not funny, Ray.

28:29.725 --> 28:32.393
I love it.

28:32.395 --> 28:33.560
What's not funny?

28:33.562 --> 28:35.604
There's nobody else here.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.313
I wasn't making a joke.

28:37.315 --> 28:38.982
Goodbye, Ray.

28:38.984 --> 28:39.817
Ranae, don't be mad.

28:39.819 --> 28:40.818
I wasn't joking.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.071
Goodbye, Ray.

28:43.697 --> 28:48.117
Is everyone having a good
time messing with me, tonight?

28:53.041 --> 28:53.957
Oh, my God.

29:21.735 --> 29:23.780
What the fuck?

29:54.394 --> 29:55.850
What happened?

29:55.852 --> 29:57.144
I don't know.

29:57.146 --> 29:58.937
Something's going
on in this house.

29:58.939 --> 30:01.147
What do you mean
something's going on?

30:01.149 --> 30:02.107
I don't know.

30:02.109 --> 30:04.652
I'm seeing things or something.

30:04.654 --> 30:06.239
What did you see?

30:08.949 --> 30:13.411
Your little
friend is completely losing it.

30:13.413 --> 30:15.413
You know
she's messed up.

30:15.415 --> 30:16.579
Don't be a dick about it.

30:16.581 --> 30:17.831
Yeah,
this isn't messed up.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.501
This is like some
padded room shit.

30:20.503 --> 30:22.712
I told you that her
mother died like a year ago,

30:22.714 --> 30:24.254
so give her a break.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.213
I could
care less, personally.

30:25.215 --> 30:26.424
I'm just saying.

30:26.426 --> 30:28.174
Yeah, you're
just talking shit

30:28.176 --> 30:30.761
when you could be like a
real person for once?

30:30.763 --> 30:33.263
Gracey, these
people left their kid with her.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.598
Think about that.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.683
So, what?

30:35.685 --> 30:37.184
So, what?

30:37.186 --> 30:40.311
She's liable to stick it in
the microwave or something.

30:40.313 --> 30:42.356
That's not funny.

30:42.358 --> 30:43.232
She's fine.

30:43.234 --> 30:44.359
Yeah, fine.

30:45.528 --> 30:48.279
She's about to file for
divorce from reality.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.406
You're the one who doesn't
seem to have a grip on reality.

30:51.408 --> 30:52.992
What are you talking about?

30:52.994 --> 30:56.537
You appear to be missing
the reality of the fact

30:56.539 --> 30:58.164
that they left us alone

30:58.166 --> 31:02.253
and do not appear to be
coming back anytime soon.

31:11.553 --> 31:13.220
I was still
skeptical when I came to

31:13.222 --> 31:14.722
Heath and Morton
today to examine the...

31:17.726 --> 31:21.063
He was just hanging there.

31:21.563 --> 31:23.148
Honey, he's fine.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.109
You don't believe me, do you?

31:28.111 --> 31:30.695
I believe you
think you saw it,

31:30.697 --> 31:33.574
but this isn't the first
time tonight, is it?

31:33.576 --> 31:34.407
The picture?

31:34.409 --> 31:35.367
There was no picture.

31:35.369 --> 31:36.618
Yes, there was.

31:36.620 --> 31:37.913
There wasn't.

31:39.581 --> 31:43.250
You all think I'm
crazy, don't you?

31:43.252 --> 31:45.211
I knew it the minute you
guys walked in here tonight.

31:45.213 --> 31:48.715
Honey, nobody thinks
you're crazy, but...

31:50.926 --> 31:52.175
Have you thought that maybe

31:52.177 --> 31:54.511
you need to go
back on your meds?

31:54.513 --> 31:57.098
Well, you haven't been
off them that long.

31:57.100 --> 32:00.267
They were antidepressants
not antipsychotics.

32:00.269 --> 32:01.851
Grief and depression
can affect people

32:01.853 --> 32:02.936
in all kinds of ways.

32:02.938 --> 32:04.688
Look at your brother.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.607
This has nothing
to do with that.

32:06.609 --> 32:07.774
Honey.

32:07.776 --> 32:10.779
Cali, there's
something in this house.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.341
Okay, slow down Tiger.

32:33.343 --> 32:34.260
They'll be back eventually.

32:34.262 --> 32:35.094
Come on, Gracey.

32:35.096 --> 32:36.302
I'll be quick.

32:36.304 --> 32:38.097
That's not exactly
an incentive.

32:38.099 --> 32:39.014
Just take off your shirt.

32:39.016 --> 32:41.393
We'll hear if they come down.

32:59.995 --> 33:02.247
Okay, stop. Let me do it.

33:11.506 --> 33:12.673
What
the fuck is wrong?

33:12.675 --> 33:13.590
What did you do?

33:13.592 --> 33:14.591
I didn't do shit.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.425
Did he hit you?

33:15.427 --> 33:16.719
What?

33:16.721 --> 33:18.220
Then what
the fuck happened?

33:18.222 --> 33:21.014
You're all fucking crazy
that's what happened.

33:21.016 --> 33:22.515
What's wrong, Grace?

33:22.517 --> 33:23.684
You're fucking
freaking everyone out.

33:23.686 --> 33:25.226
Shut up!

33:25.228 --> 33:26.228
Grace!

33:26.230 --> 33:27.480
Did he hit you?

33:27.482 --> 33:29.357
Quit fucking asking
her if I hit her!

33:29.359 --> 33:30.441
I didn't fucking hit her.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.649
Everybody calm down.

33:31.651 --> 33:33.652
Jeremy, shut up for a minute.

33:33.654 --> 33:34.986
Don't
tell me to shut up.

33:34.988 --> 33:37.072
This is your freak show.

33:37.074 --> 33:38.992
Grace, what happened?

33:40.786 --> 33:42.994
What did you see, Ranae?

33:42.996 --> 33:44.288
What?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.626
In the monitor, outside...

33:48.252 --> 33:49.167
What did you see?

33:49.169 --> 33:50.504
Wait, outside?

33:51.589 --> 33:52.879
Nothing.

33:52.881 --> 33:54.048
I didn't see anything.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.383
That's bullshit, Ranae.

33:55.385 --> 33:56.216
Hey!

33:56.218 --> 33:57.425
J's right.

33:57.427 --> 33:58.886
You've been walking
around here all night

33:58.888 --> 34:00.178
scaring the shit out of everyone

34:00.180 --> 34:02.682
and now suddenly you
don't know anything.

34:02.684 --> 34:04.392
What happened here?

34:04.394 --> 34:05.893
We were fooling
around a little bit.

34:05.895 --> 34:06.726
Jesus!

34:06.728 --> 34:08.145
Oh, fucking relax.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.563
It's not a church, okay?

34:09.565 --> 34:11.232
It's somebody's
fucking living room.

34:11.234 --> 34:12.942
Try keeping it in
your pants for once.

34:12.944 --> 34:14.985
Takes two tango, bitch.

34:14.987 --> 34:15.945
It's not like she
was complaining.

34:15.947 --> 34:17.487
Oh, yeah, she's great.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.407
Fuck off!

34:20.409 --> 34:21.866
We were fooling
around on the couch

34:21.868 --> 34:24.619
and then she screamed
and started flipping out.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.581
Grace, what happened?

34:28.918 --> 34:30.460
What did you see?

34:31.712 --> 34:35.255
Nothing,
it was just...

34:35.257 --> 34:36.091
Nothing.

34:42.389 --> 34:45.225
There's something
in this house.

34:47.978 --> 34:49.062
What is it?

34:50.565 --> 34:52.608
I know it sounds crazy,

34:54.235 --> 34:55.067
but I think it was...

34:55.069 --> 34:56.485
If you say ghost,

34:56.487 --> 34:58.654
I'm going to fucking
lose my mind on you guys.

34:58.656 --> 35:00.489
Shut up, baby dick.

35:00.491 --> 35:02.324
A ghost, okay?

35:02.326 --> 35:04.367
A fucking ghost.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.786
Oh, my god!

35:05.788 --> 35:06.829
You guys are off the planet.

35:06.831 --> 35:07.665
Jeremy!

35:10.752 --> 35:13.210
What exactly did you see?

35:13.212 --> 35:15.212
I don't know.

35:15.214 --> 35:18.049
It was a girl, that's for sure.

35:18.051 --> 35:22.136
Small, but I couldn't
see her face or her eyes.

35:22.138 --> 35:23.304
Jesus Christ.

35:23.306 --> 35:24.721
Do you ever shut up?

35:24.723 --> 35:25.639
Not when everyone
else around me

35:25.641 --> 35:27.849
is acting fucking crazy, no.

35:27.851 --> 35:31.311
And she was just
staring at us.

35:31.313 --> 35:33.146
You just said you
couldn't see her face.

35:33.148 --> 35:33.982
I know,

35:35.777 --> 35:37.817
but I could feel it.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.277
Listen to yourselves.

35:39.279 --> 35:40.320
What is your problem?

35:40.322 --> 35:41.822
What's my problem?

35:41.824 --> 35:43.991
I'm sitting here with a
bunch of paranoid hysterics

35:43.993 --> 35:45.742
talking about ghosts.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.494
That's my fucking problem.

35:47.496 --> 35:48.746
I was right here.

35:48.748 --> 35:49.996
There was no girl, there
was no fucking ghost.

35:49.998 --> 35:51.206
How do you know?

35:51.208 --> 35:54.085
Because there's no
such thing as ghosts.

35:54.087 --> 35:56.003
Do I really have to
say that out loud?

35:56.005 --> 35:58.005
So what exactly
did she see then, Jeremy?

35:58.007 --> 35:58.963
How the hell should I know?

35:58.965 --> 35:59.924
She's probably just on the rag.

36:00.927 --> 36:02.009
You pig.

36:02.011 --> 36:03.469
You did not just say that.

36:03.471 --> 36:05.596
You tell me
what's more likely.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.098
You've got a case of
the crimson crazies

36:07.100 --> 36:09.558
or you saw a god damn ghost.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.518
Fuck you.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.851
No, fuck you.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.395
Fuck all of you.

36:16.734 --> 36:18.692
Where are you going?

36:18.694 --> 36:20.820
I'm going to take a
piss and find a beer.

36:20.822 --> 36:23.364
What the fuck do you care?

36:23.366 --> 36:25.574
Hey, ghost girl, I am
going to take a piss

36:25.576 --> 36:28.076
and find a beer if
you wanna kill me, okay?

36:28.078 --> 36:31.373
Just let me have the
beer first, thanks.

36:32.583 --> 36:33.416
Jeremy don't!

36:33.418 --> 36:34.919
Just let him go.

36:36.337 --> 36:38.087
I don't think it's a good
idea for us to be alone.

36:38.089 --> 36:39.380
Who gives a shit about him?

36:39.382 --> 36:40.965
If there's really
something in this house-

36:40.967 --> 36:43.175
- He's not going to
listen to you, Ranae.

36:43.177 --> 36:44.884
She's right.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.971
It's like trying to reason
with a one year old.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.264
What?

36:49.266 --> 36:51.224
I just said he's not
going to listen to you.

36:51.226 --> 36:53.730
No, Grace, what did you say?

36:55.188 --> 36:58.232
I said it's like trying
to talk to a one year old.

36:58.234 --> 36:59.694
A one year old.

37:43.487 --> 37:44.945
What are you looking for?

37:44.947 --> 37:47.197
Here, look at this.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.366
Baby
pictures, so what?

37:49.368 --> 37:50.202
Wait.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.121
I don't get what we're suppose
to be looking at, sweetie.

37:55.123 --> 37:55.957
Wait!

37:59.295 --> 38:01.297
There, look.

38:02.339 --> 38:04.965
It's a birthday
party, so what?

38:04.967 --> 38:06.550
It's a first birthday party.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.052
Yeah, they're at a first
birthday party, so what?

38:09.054 --> 38:10.804
No, they're not at a
first birthday party,

38:10.806 --> 38:12.764
they're throwing one.

38:12.766 --> 38:14.808
Okay, so?

38:14.810 --> 38:17.186
So, Miller's only
like three months old.

38:17.188 --> 38:18.395
And?

38:18.397 --> 38:19.730
And they don't
have any other kids.

38:19.732 --> 38:22.190
Fine, so it's for
someone else's kid.

38:22.192 --> 38:24.819
No, that's
definitely their kid.

38:24.821 --> 38:27.862
Do you think they had
another kid before and lost it?

38:27.864 --> 38:29.489
Maybe.

38:29.491 --> 38:30.657
Well, so what?

38:30.659 --> 38:32.117
The thing I saw
wasn't a one year old.

38:32.119 --> 38:34.244
No, these pictures are just
from the kid's first year.

38:34.246 --> 38:35.496
Who knows how old it was.

38:35.498 --> 38:36.746
Come on.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.833
Seriously, why not?

38:38.835 --> 38:40.375
Cali, you met them.

38:40.377 --> 38:41.460
How old were they?

38:41.462 --> 38:42.837
Forty at least, right?

38:42.839 --> 38:45.338
At least, probably older.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.882
Okay, so mid-forties.

38:46.884 --> 38:48.134
They could have had a kid
that was five years old.

38:48.136 --> 38:49.552
It wasn't a five
year old either.

38:49.554 --> 38:50.802
Fine!

38:50.804 --> 38:52.429
They could have a 10
year old, a teenager!

38:52.431 --> 38:54.849
I mean at their age, they
could have a kid in its 20s.

38:54.851 --> 38:56.516
Ranae!

38:56.518 --> 38:58.436
Why not, right?

38:58.438 --> 39:00.645
By that logic, they
could have had an older kid

39:00.647 --> 39:03.232
who just moved out or went
to college or whatever.

39:03.234 --> 39:04.190
Yeah, that's true.

39:04.192 --> 39:05.275
No way.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.527
These people
interviewed me twice.

39:07.529 --> 39:09.989
That would have come up.

39:09.991 --> 39:11.574
How do you know?

39:11.576 --> 39:13.036
I know.

39:14.411 --> 39:15.201
What are you doing?

39:15.203 --> 39:16.538
I'm calling Ray.

40:34.826 --> 40:35.659
Fuck!

40:40.456 --> 40:43.708
There is no way you
guys are babysitting a ghost.

40:43.710 --> 40:45.835
Ray, I'm not screwing around.

40:45.837 --> 40:47.503
You've been obsessed with
this stuff for a year.

40:47.505 --> 40:48.753
That's my point.

40:48.755 --> 40:50.588
I live and breathe this stuff.

40:50.590 --> 40:53.300
I hang out in live
chats on Saturday nights

40:53.302 --> 40:55.677
watching lectures by
paranormal experts

40:55.679 --> 40:58.471
and my stupid sister
sees a ghost in Wisconsin

40:58.473 --> 41:00.266
while I'm stuck here in Utah.

41:00.268 --> 41:02.851
I mean there's no way the
universe is that cruel.

41:02.853 --> 41:05.186
Ray, if they lost their child,

41:05.188 --> 41:07.523
is it possible that her
ghost is in this house?

41:07.525 --> 41:08.773
Of course it's possible,

41:08.775 --> 41:10.358
that's how this
kind of thing works.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.652
What do you mean?

41:11.654 --> 41:13.904
Well, a kid probably
didn't just die, right?

41:13.906 --> 41:17.199
More likely an accident
or terrible disease

41:17.201 --> 41:18.659
or something tragic.

41:18.661 --> 41:20.828
That's like textbook
ghost stuff.

41:20.830 --> 41:23.663
It's like their soul
has unfinished business

41:23.665 --> 41:26.833
and it can't release until
that business is resolved.

41:26.835 --> 41:28.085
That makes perfect sense.

41:28.087 --> 41:28.918
It does?

41:28.920 --> 41:30.087
What?

41:30.089 --> 41:32.130
Why are we taking
him seriously?

41:32.132 --> 41:34.007
He knows tons
about this stuff.

41:34.009 --> 41:36.427
He's just a dumb
kid with a weird hobby.

41:36.429 --> 41:38.137
You know I can
hear you, right?

41:38.139 --> 41:40.181
Don't be shitty, Grace.

41:40.183 --> 41:41.931
Look, no
offense kid, honestly,

41:41.933 --> 41:44.059
but give me a fucking break.

41:44.061 --> 41:45.518
Holy crap!

41:45.520 --> 41:48.021
Is that the thing I saw
when I called you guys last?

41:48.023 --> 41:49.273
Seriously, what did you guys see

41:49.275 --> 41:51.108
because what I
saw wasn't a baby?

41:51.110 --> 41:53.610
I don't know
what I saw anymore.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.654
We don't know how old the
other kid was when it died.

41:55.656 --> 41:58.157
We don't know that they
had another kid that died.

41:58.159 --> 41:59.741
That's easy
enough to find out.

41:59.743 --> 42:00.576
Hang on.

43:06.060 --> 43:07.645
Grace, you bitch.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.282
You should just
tell the parents.

43:21.284 --> 43:22.574
And say what?

43:22.576 --> 43:24.076
That their dead daughter
is haunting their house?

43:24.078 --> 43:26.203
No, you should just
tell them what Grace saw.

43:26.205 --> 43:27.663
You'd think they'd
want to know that.

43:27.665 --> 43:29.415
I don't even know
what I saw anymore.

43:29.417 --> 43:31.041
Fifteen minutes ago
you were pretty sure.

43:31.043 --> 43:32.668
None of
this makes any sense.

43:32.670 --> 43:36.588
Don't let Jeremy convince
you you didn't see anything.

43:36.590 --> 43:38.715
Where is J anyway?

43:38.717 --> 43:40.634
Hey, I found something.

43:40.636 --> 43:41.802
What is it?

43:41.804 --> 43:43.887
Um, it's
an online obituary.

43:43.889 --> 43:44.723
So?

43:46.683 --> 43:48.141
Wow!

43:48.143 --> 43:51.811
Yeah, they had a daughter who
died like seven years ago.

43:51.813 --> 43:55.232
Rose Ann Belasco, daughter
of Roman and Tanya Belasco,

43:55.234 --> 43:57.610
died unexpectedly
at the family home

43:57.612 --> 44:00.779
outside of Madison,
Wisconsin last week.

44:00.781 --> 44:01.989
I knew it.

44:01.991 --> 44:04.032
Here, look at this.

44:04.034 --> 44:07.705
Joyful spirit, blah,
blah, blah, classmates,

44:09.415 --> 44:12.708
devoted caregiver,
blah, blah, blah,

44:12.710 --> 44:13.958
loving grandparents...

44:13.960 --> 44:15.378
How old was she?

44:15.380 --> 44:17.048
Um, hang on.

44:18.299 --> 44:20.340
Nine years old.

44:20.342 --> 44:22.592
Nine years old.

44:22.594 --> 44:24.469
Could what you have
saw been a nine year old?

44:24.471 --> 44:27.264
I told you, I don't
know that I saw anything.

44:27.266 --> 44:28.059
Grace!

44:29.018 --> 44:30.186
Yeah, maybe.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.186
I don't know.

44:35.357 --> 44:36.523
Ray.

44:36.525 --> 44:38.025
Here, look at this.

44:38.027 --> 44:39.445
Here's a picture.

44:40.612 --> 44:42.195
She's beautiful.

44:42.197 --> 44:44.322
Ray, could that have
been the girl you saw?

44:44.324 --> 44:45.949
I don't
know, it's possible.

44:45.951 --> 44:48.201
I didn't get a great look
'cause it was so dark.

44:48.203 --> 44:49.244
Holy shit.

44:49.246 --> 44:50.413
You guys have to get

44:50.415 --> 44:51.913
a video or a picture
or something.

44:51.915 --> 44:55.208
I am not posing for
pictures with a dead girl.

44:55.210 --> 44:57.128
How did she die, Ray?

44:57.130 --> 44:58.128
Um, it doesn't say much.

44:58.130 --> 44:59.963
It just says at the home.

44:59.965 --> 45:01.172
Can you look somewhere

45:01.174 --> 45:02.299
and see if you
can find anything?

45:02.301 --> 45:03.550
Yeah, sure.

45:03.552 --> 45:06.387
Grace, could that have
been the girl you saw?

45:06.389 --> 45:07.223
Asshole.

45:08.348 --> 45:09.306
Grace, could
that be the girl?

45:09.308 --> 45:10.558
Not now!

45:10.560 --> 45:11.766
What's wrong?

45:11.768 --> 45:13.059
Fucking asshole
just sent me a video

45:13.061 --> 45:14.395
of him and another girl.

45:16.065 --> 45:17.480
Sleezebag!

45:17.482 --> 45:18.398
Where are you going?

45:18.400 --> 45:20.358
I'm going to kill him.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.235
Ray!

45:21.237 --> 45:22.570
Uh, hang on.

45:22.572 --> 45:24.864
No, Ray, pay attention.

45:24.866 --> 45:25.697
What is it?

45:25.699 --> 45:27.657
Is it dangerous?

45:27.659 --> 45:28.826
I don't think so.

45:28.828 --> 45:30.244
You don't think so?

45:30.246 --> 45:31.996
How could he possibly know?

45:31.998 --> 45:34.165
Grace is right,
he's just guessing.

45:34.167 --> 45:35.750
I'm not just guessing.

45:35.752 --> 45:36.708
Ray.

45:36.710 --> 45:37.918
Uh, hang on.

45:37.920 --> 45:41.922
They're doing a live Q&A
in the chat, I'll ask.

45:41.924 --> 45:43.799
What do they think?

45:43.801 --> 45:45.759
Hang on, I'm still
getting answers.

45:45.761 --> 45:46.886
I don't
wanna hang on, Ray.

45:46.888 --> 45:48.512
I'm scared!

45:57.607 --> 45:59.857
Okay, the general consensus is

45:59.859 --> 46:02.360
that a spirit of this nature,

46:02.362 --> 46:03.944
like a kid tied to the family,

46:03.946 --> 46:07.907
is only really dangerous if
it's a discontented spirit.

46:07.909 --> 46:09.199
What does that mean?

46:09.201 --> 46:11.911
You know, if it died
violently or tragically

46:11.913 --> 46:14.163
or if there's some
injustice that's making it

46:14.165 --> 46:15.998
linger between worlds,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.125
or I guess, if it
was a bad seed.

46:18.127 --> 46:20.668
But, I mean, how could a
nine year old be a bad seed?

46:20.670 --> 46:22.880
You obviously don't babysit.

46:22.882 --> 46:25.382
You're
always so funny, Cali.

46:25.384 --> 46:27.634
You're really not
making me feel any better, Ray.

46:27.636 --> 46:30.137
Any of those things
could apply here.

46:30.139 --> 46:32.264
Yeah, but that's
not the only factor.

46:32.266 --> 46:33.724
What do you mean?

46:33.726 --> 46:35.601
Well, those are just
the reasons that a spirit

46:35.603 --> 46:36.976
might be bitter or angry,

46:36.978 --> 46:39.313
but that doesn't
make it dangerous.

46:39.315 --> 46:40.898
Can we
cut to the chase?

46:40.900 --> 46:43.525
Fine, so what
makes it dangerous?

46:43.527 --> 46:45.985
Well, most of the
evidence suggests...

46:45.987 --> 46:47.154
Evidence?

46:47.156 --> 46:49.030
For lack of a
better word, whatever.

46:49.032 --> 46:50.366
Most of the
evidence suggests?

46:50.368 --> 46:51.866
That a spirit like this

46:51.868 --> 46:55.663
is only really dangerous on
the anniversary of its death.

46:55.665 --> 46:56.663
Why?

46:56.665 --> 46:57.915
I don't know, but people think

46:57.917 --> 47:00.000
that it's only on the
anniversary of its death

47:00.002 --> 47:01.876
that it can actually
physically interact

47:01.878 --> 47:03.170
with this world.

47:03.172 --> 47:04.295
Physically interact?

47:04.297 --> 47:05.380
What does that mean?

47:05.382 --> 47:07.340
You know, like grab something,

47:07.342 --> 47:09.509
pick something up, hurt someone.

47:09.511 --> 47:11.429
On other days, you
might hear it or see it,

47:11.431 --> 47:13.389
but it's only that
one day a year

47:13.391 --> 47:16.766
that it can actually cross
the bridge and do harm.

47:16.768 --> 47:19.728
Okay, so
is today the day?

47:19.730 --> 47:21.480
When did Rose die, Ray?

47:21.482 --> 47:23.357
Does the obituary say?

47:23.359 --> 47:25.192
Uh, hang on.

47:38.290 --> 47:40.792
I'm going to wring his neck.

47:43.628 --> 47:44.712
Found it.

47:44.714 --> 47:45.920
So?

47:45.922 --> 47:49.050
Uh, what's
the date today?

47:49.052 --> 47:52.094
October 7th, for a few
more minutes at least.

47:52.096 --> 47:53.054
When did Rose die?

47:53.056 --> 47:53.887
Yeah, you guys are fine.

47:53.889 --> 47:55.681
She died on the 3rd.

47:55.683 --> 47:58.016
Okay, that is
way to close for comfort.

47:58.018 --> 47:59.726
You're sure.

47:59.728 --> 48:01.103
Absolutely.

48:01.105 --> 48:04.982
It says the 3rd and the obituary
itself is dated the 5th.

48:04.984 --> 48:07.150
You guys should be totally fine.

48:07.152 --> 48:08.402
I believe you, Ray.

48:08.404 --> 48:10.404
But can you please
just confirm that?

48:10.406 --> 48:12.822
Maybe see if there
are any news articles?

48:12.824 --> 48:14.574
Anything to confirm it.

48:14.576 --> 48:15.867
Um, yeah.

48:15.869 --> 48:16.659
I have to go to the
bathroom real quick,

48:16.661 --> 48:18.538
but I'll be right back.

48:19.623 --> 48:20.625
Thank you.

48:21.750 --> 48:24.960
Ranae, you know what
this means, right?

48:24.962 --> 48:26.670
It doesn't mean anything, Ray.

48:26.672 --> 48:29.297
Just call me back
on my cell, okay?

48:29.299 --> 48:30.757
Okay, bye.

48:35.556 --> 48:36.806
I take it back,

48:36.808 --> 48:40.308
I am really happy
you guys came over.

48:45.315 --> 48:47.358
I can't believe it's
already midnight.

48:49.027 --> 48:53.198
At least we know the
little shit isn't dangerous.

49:14.846 --> 49:16.139
Jesus, Grace!

49:17.556 --> 49:21.391
You scared
the shit outta me.

49:21.393 --> 49:25.564
If you're coming to
apologize, I'm not interested.

49:33.447 --> 49:35.157
What is your problem?

49:44.125 --> 49:45.833
Yeah, you had your chance.

49:45.835 --> 49:47.420
I'm not interested.

49:52.215 --> 49:53.467
Come on, Grace.

49:59.639 --> 50:00.475
Grace.

50:29.462 --> 50:30.628
Ugh, what the fuck?

50:30.630 --> 50:32.632
Did you fucking bite me?

50:53.069 --> 50:55.612
Jesus Christ, what is with you?

53:03.366 --> 53:04.784
Jeremy.

53:12.958 --> 53:17.043
Jeremy?

53:17.045 --> 53:19.674
Jeremy, where the fuck are you?

53:25.263 --> 53:26.054
Jeremy?

53:27.306 --> 53:29.223
Are you in here?

53:39.527 --> 53:41.070
Not funny, asshole.

55:00.148 --> 55:01.732
He wants to know
how it's going.

55:01.734 --> 55:03.150
No, he doesn't.

55:03.152 --> 55:05.485
I have no idea what to say.

55:05.487 --> 55:08.154
Tell him
one child is sleeping

55:08.156 --> 55:10.659
but the other's definitely up.

55:12.703 --> 55:14.911
That's not funny at all.

55:14.913 --> 55:18.165
Seriously, I feel like
I should say something.

55:18.167 --> 55:20.960
Please, what
are you gonna say?

55:20.962 --> 55:22.001
That there's
something strange

55:22.003 --> 55:23.545
going on in their house.

55:23.547 --> 55:25.338
You will
freak them out.

55:25.340 --> 55:26.799
That there's
something here.

55:26.801 --> 55:27.967
Ranae?

55:27.969 --> 55:28.967
That it might
be their daughter!

55:28.969 --> 55:30.053
Be serious.

55:31.431 --> 55:34.056
If you tell them that
they'll have you committed.

55:44.027 --> 55:44.860
What?

55:51.159 --> 55:51.993
What?

56:03.462 --> 56:05.130
Honey, what's wrong?

56:06.214 --> 56:07.049
Nothing.

56:08.176 --> 56:09.509
Nothing's wrong.

58:30.317 --> 58:31.819
Help me.

58:40.994 --> 58:41.828
Help me.

58:42.705 --> 58:43.873
Help, help me.

59:28.375 --> 59:30.419
Nothing's wrong my ass.

59:32.045 --> 59:33.837
No, it's not just that.

59:33.839 --> 59:36.257
Something just happened.

59:38.386 --> 59:39.721
What?

59:41.346 --> 59:44.849
I never told you what
happened to my mom.

59:44.851 --> 59:48.936
I know she died just
before you came to college.

59:48.938 --> 59:52.940
Her one year memorial
service was last month.

59:52.942 --> 59:55.277
Cancer, right?

59:57.154 --> 59:59.822
That's
what I tell people.

59:59.824 --> 01:00:01.159
But it wasn't.

01:00:06.121 --> 01:00:09.290
Growing up it was
just Mom, Ray, and me.

01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:11.125
She was only 18
when she left home

01:00:11.127 --> 01:00:13.293
and moved away with my dad.

01:00:13.295 --> 01:00:17.088
Then, he left right
after I was born.

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.134
Just one day,

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:20.302
bye.

01:00:21.554 --> 01:00:24.637
My mom was like 20 or something,

01:00:24.639 --> 01:00:25.641
no education

01:00:26.558 --> 01:00:27.476
and a baby.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.605
Her parents are halfway across
the country holding a grudge

01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:35.275
and she's completely on her own.

01:00:37.194 --> 01:00:40.654
So four years later
Ray comes along,

01:00:40.656 --> 01:00:44.826
but his dad was never really
in the picture either.

01:00:46.578 --> 01:00:49.121
In and out of school,

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.415
in and out of jobs,

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:53.002
in and out of guys,

01:00:54.837 --> 01:00:57.340
but she tried, she really did.

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:02.675
She busted her butt and did
everything for Ray and me.

01:01:02.677 --> 01:01:03.596
Everything.

01:01:05.056 --> 01:01:06.391
What happened?

01:01:09.101 --> 01:01:12.020
So, last summer
after I graduate,

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.523
my summer job's at
this yogurt place

01:01:15.525 --> 01:01:17.858
and my mom's suppose
to pick me up

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.110
one night from work,

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:21.364
but she's late.

01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:26.409
So, I'm texting her.

01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:27.826
Where are you?

01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:29.578
Did you forget?

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.915
What's going on?

01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.125
But she's not responding

01:01:35.127 --> 01:01:38.670
because she's obviously
driving, right?

01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:40.715
But I keep texting her
because I'm being a bitch

01:01:40.717 --> 01:01:42.635
and I'm all pissed off.

01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:46.219
She must have gotten worried

01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:48.471
that she was getting
all these texts

01:01:48.473 --> 01:01:50.726
because a witness said that

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.518
she was looking at her phone

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.565
when she slammed head-on
into a pickup truck

01:01:57.567 --> 01:01:59.152
and died instantly.

01:02:00.987 --> 01:02:02.405
Ranae, sweetie.

01:02:04.156 --> 01:02:06.949
So, you stand at her
casket and you cry,

01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:08.241
and you lie in your
dorm room at night

01:02:08.243 --> 01:02:10.411
begging her to forgive you

01:02:10.413 --> 01:02:13.581
and your baby brother gets
obsessed with spirits and ghosts

01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:14.748
because, hey,

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.916
maybe if ghosts are real,

01:02:15.918 --> 01:02:18.418
she's not really gone.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.674
But she is gone, just gone.

01:02:24.886 --> 01:02:28.012
And you don't know
if she hears you

01:02:28.014 --> 01:02:29.807
or if she forgives you

01:02:30.933 --> 01:02:32.601
or if she even knows

01:02:34.811 --> 01:02:37.982
that she was everything
to Ray and me.

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:44.652
And the last thing I said
to her before she died,

01:02:44.654 --> 01:02:48.199
was that she was
a terrible mother.

01:02:48.201 --> 01:02:49.034
Sweetie.

01:03:07.344 --> 01:03:09.052
They're going to be home soon.

01:03:09.054 --> 01:03:10.721
We should find J and Grace.

01:03:10.723 --> 01:03:12.223
Are you okay?

01:03:12.225 --> 01:03:13.849
I'm fine.

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:16.643
Let's just get this
night over with.

01:03:16.645 --> 01:03:18.270
Okay.

01:03:18.272 --> 01:03:21.690
Why don't you look by the bedrooms
and I'll look downstairs.

01:03:21.692 --> 01:03:23.900
No, we should stay together.

01:03:23.902 --> 01:03:25.069
Honey, your brother said

01:03:25.071 --> 01:03:26.987
we didn't have anything
to worry about.

01:03:26.989 --> 01:03:28.907
Something's not right.

01:03:30.784 --> 01:03:32.953
Okay, let's go together.

01:03:42.337 --> 01:03:43.545
It's Ray.

01:03:43.547 --> 01:03:44.797
I'll go
check downstairs.

01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:49.134
No, wait for me.

01:03:49.136 --> 01:03:50.052
Ray.

01:03:50.054 --> 01:03:52.096
How are you guys doing?

01:03:52.098 --> 01:03:53.848
We're scared.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.683
Did you find out anything more?

01:03:55.685 --> 01:03:56.683
It's totally fine.

01:03:56.685 --> 01:03:59.021
You guys are perfectly safe.

01:04:01.065 --> 01:04:02.480
Are you sure, Ray?

01:04:02.482 --> 01:04:04.858
There's weird stuff
happening here.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.317
I'm 100% sure.

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:07.902
Rose might be messing
with you guys,

01:04:07.904 --> 01:04:10.655
but she doesn't pose
any real danger.

01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:12.949
I don't know, Ray.

01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:15.369
Did you find out
anything more about her?

01:04:15.371 --> 01:04:19.790
I found an article
online, but it didn't say much.

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:21.375
How did she die?

01:04:21.377 --> 01:04:23.251
Accidental drowning.

01:04:23.253 --> 01:04:24.962
She drowned?

01:04:24.964 --> 01:04:26.255
Freak accident.

01:04:26.257 --> 01:04:27.965
She was playing with
some friends by a creek

01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:30.467
and got tangled up and died.

01:04:30.469 --> 01:04:32.636
That doesn't make any sense.

01:04:32.638 --> 01:04:35.056
We have to be missing
something here.

01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:36.306
Why?

01:04:36.308 --> 01:04:39.351
Because she's here,
Ray, and she's angry.

01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:42.357
I don't believe
she's not dangerous.

01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:45.400
Grace?

01:04:46.569 --> 01:04:47.402
Jeremy?

01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:50.572
Are you guys down here?

01:04:52.699 --> 01:04:54.074
If you guys are screwing
around down here,

01:04:54.076 --> 01:04:56.494
we need to get going.

01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:13.095
Guys, are you in here?

01:05:46.002 --> 01:05:47.712
What if it isn't Rose?

01:05:47.714 --> 01:05:48.797
What?

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.799
What if there's
something else in the house

01:05:51.801 --> 01:05:53.550
and it isn't Rose?

01:05:53.552 --> 01:05:55.969
That's impossible,
it has to be Rose.

01:05:55.971 --> 01:05:57.137
Why?

01:05:57.139 --> 01:05:59.473
We're just assuming
that it's her.

01:05:59.475 --> 01:06:01.808
It might be something
completely different.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.184
We don't know.

01:06:03.186 --> 01:06:07.148
But what else
could it possibly be?

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.733
I don't know.

01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:11.527
Maybe someone who
lived here before?

01:06:11.529 --> 01:06:14.989
Maybe someone who died
building the house?

01:06:14.991 --> 01:06:16.492
Maybe just some...

01:06:17.409 --> 01:06:20.494
You're talking crazy.

01:06:20.496 --> 01:06:21.831
I'm not crazy.

01:06:23.165 --> 01:06:25.166
Just try and keep calm,

01:06:25.168 --> 01:06:27.793
let Miller sleep, and wait
until his parents get home.

01:06:27.795 --> 01:06:29.628
It'll all be over soon.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:30.880
No, Ray!

01:06:30.882 --> 01:06:33.299
Whatever is in this
house is dangerous

01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:37.052
and if Rose isn't dangerous,
then it's not Rose.

01:06:37.054 --> 01:06:38.679
Ranae, stop.

01:06:38.681 --> 01:06:40.096
No!

01:06:40.098 --> 01:06:42.183
There's something here
that we're missing.

01:06:42.185 --> 01:06:45.018
There's something
here we're not seeing.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.689
There's something we don't know.

01:06:59.576 --> 01:07:00.410
Ray?

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.204
Why did you say Miller?

01:07:04.206 --> 01:07:05.290
What?

01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:09.628
You said, "Let Miller sleep."

01:07:12.297 --> 01:07:14.216
Why did you say Miller?

01:07:28.397 --> 01:07:32.358
I never told you the
baby's name was Miller.

01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:54.464
Say hi to your
mom for me, bitch.

01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:23.783
Guys, the parents
are coming home soon

01:08:23.785 --> 01:08:26.662
so we need to get out of here.

01:09:34.356 --> 01:09:36.064
Guys, quit screwing around.

01:09:36.066 --> 01:09:37.234
We need to go.

01:10:04.344 --> 01:10:06.888
You're all gonna die.

01:10:49.097 --> 01:10:50.055
Ray?

01:10:50.057 --> 01:10:51.265
Ranae, what's wrong?

01:10:51.267 --> 01:10:52.515
Ray, is
that really you?

01:10:52.517 --> 01:10:54.100
What are
you talking about?

01:10:54.102 --> 01:10:55.519
Well, what did
you find out, Ray?

01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:58.064
I found some
articles about Rose.

01:10:58.066 --> 01:10:59.189
Did she drown?

01:10:59.191 --> 01:11:00.107
What?

01:11:00.109 --> 01:11:01.567
Yeah, how'd you know that?

01:11:01.569 --> 01:11:02.859
The date was wrong, right?

01:11:02.861 --> 01:11:04.362
The date was wrong

01:11:04.364 --> 01:11:05.613
and the accident was seven
years ago today, wasn't it?

01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:07.948
No, Ranae,
the date wasn't wrong.

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:09.324
It has to be.

01:11:09.326 --> 01:11:11.493
This has to be the
anniversary of her accident.

01:11:11.495 --> 01:11:12.787
No, Ranae, listen!

01:11:12.789 --> 01:11:14.204
It wasn't an accident.

01:11:14.206 --> 01:11:15.663
What?

01:11:15.665 --> 01:11:16.498
There was a nanny.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.666
And it was never proved,

01:11:17.668 --> 01:11:19.210
but the police suspected
that the nanny...

01:11:19.212 --> 01:11:20.043
A what?

01:11:20.045 --> 01:11:21.461
A nanny.

01:11:21.463 --> 01:11:22.712
One of those foreign
exchange nannies or whatever.

01:11:22.714 --> 01:11:24.506
What are you saying, Ray?

01:11:24.508 --> 01:11:26.675
There was a nanny
and she killed Rose!

01:11:26.677 --> 01:11:30.136
She drowned her in a
crick behind their house.

01:11:30.138 --> 01:11:31.805
What?

01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:33.015
Why?

01:11:33.017 --> 01:11:33.849
They don't know.

01:11:33.851 --> 01:11:35.059
She wasn't right.

01:11:35.061 --> 01:11:36.810
She had a history or
something, I don't know.

01:11:36.812 --> 01:11:39.771
It all came out later, but
none of it's very clear.

01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:41.482
But you said it
was never proved.

01:11:41.484 --> 01:11:42.315
No.

01:11:42.317 --> 01:11:43.484
Why not?

01:11:43.486 --> 01:11:44.859
Because she died, Ranae.

01:11:44.861 --> 01:11:47.195
What?

01:11:47.197 --> 01:11:49.325
She hung herself.

01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:52.326
When, Ray?

01:11:52.328 --> 01:11:54.577
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

01:11:54.579 --> 01:11:55.914
It was tomorrow.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.166
What do you mean tomorrow?

01:11:59.168 --> 01:12:00.835
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:03.712
You have to get out of
that house by midnight,

01:12:03.714 --> 01:12:04.796
because the nanny killed herself

01:12:04.798 --> 01:12:07.299
seven years ago tomorrow.

01:12:07.301 --> 01:12:08.551
Oh, my god.

01:12:08.553 --> 01:12:10.344
What?

01:12:10.346 --> 01:12:12.846
You're in Utah, Ray.

01:12:12.848 --> 01:12:16.016
It's already tomorrow, here.

01:12:53.931 --> 01:12:54.723
Jeremy?

01:13:17.914 --> 01:13:19.287
Ray, I need your help.

01:13:19.289 --> 01:13:20.581
I have to find the others.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:23.083
Call 911 and...

01:13:23.085 --> 01:13:23.919
Ray?

01:14:34.072 --> 01:14:35.363
It's
me! It's me, Cali!

01:14:35.365 --> 01:14:36.657
Cali! Cali, it's me.

01:14:36.659 --> 01:14:38.993
It's Ranae.

01:14:38.995 --> 01:14:40.661
Honey, it's me.

01:14:40.663 --> 01:14:42.162
There's nothing there.

01:14:42.164 --> 01:14:43.372
You're fine.

01:14:43.374 --> 01:14:45.750
You're fine, there's
nothing there.

01:14:45.752 --> 01:14:47.417
Ray was wrong, Ranae.

01:14:47.419 --> 01:14:48.252
I know.

01:14:48.254 --> 01:14:49.086
No, Ray was wrong.

01:14:49.088 --> 01:14:50.671
Jeremy's dead.

01:14:50.673 --> 01:14:51.588
What?

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:52.840
And Rose killed Jeremy.

01:14:52.842 --> 01:14:54.007
Oh, my god.

01:14:54.009 --> 01:14:55.216
And Grace,
too, I think.

01:14:55.218 --> 01:14:56.051
What?

01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:57.052
I saw her.

01:14:57.054 --> 01:14:59.012
Ranae, Rose tried to kill me.

01:14:59.014 --> 01:15:00.096
Cali, it's not Rose.

01:15:00.098 --> 01:15:01.181
What?

01:15:01.183 --> 01:15:02.850
It's not Rose, it's her nanny.

01:15:02.852 --> 01:15:04.769
She murdered Rose and
then killed herself

01:15:04.771 --> 01:15:06.269
seven years ago, today.

01:15:06.271 --> 01:15:07.520
Why?

01:15:07.522 --> 01:15:08.314
We have
to get out of here.

01:15:08.316 --> 01:15:09.230
Why is she doing this?

01:15:09.232 --> 01:15:10.274
Why is she after us?

01:15:10.276 --> 01:15:11.192
I don't know.

01:15:11.194 --> 01:15:12.359
Why now?

01:15:12.361 --> 01:15:16.199
She died seven
years ago, why now?

01:15:18.034 --> 01:15:19.949
Oh, my god, Miller!

01:15:19.951 --> 01:15:20.786
What?

01:15:22.245 --> 01:15:24.829
There hasn't been another
child after Rose until now.

01:15:24.831 --> 01:15:26.040
What?

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:27.707
She came back to kill
their newborn baby.

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:29.417
But, I...

01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:31.420
She doesn't care about us.

01:15:31.422 --> 01:15:32.755
She's just playing
games with us.

01:15:32.757 --> 01:15:34.172
She really wants Miller.

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:35.382
Ranae?

01:15:35.384 --> 01:15:37.385
Cali, we have to
get him out of here.

01:15:38.553 --> 01:15:39.886
Shh, shh.

01:15:39.888 --> 01:15:41.346
She's gonna kill us.

01:15:41.348 --> 01:15:42.555
Go, take him out of here.

01:15:42.557 --> 01:15:44.641
No, she's gonna
kill us, Ranae.

01:15:44.643 --> 01:15:45.475
Cali, where's your phone?

01:15:45.477 --> 01:15:46.976
What?

01:15:46.978 --> 01:15:48.229
Your phone, use
the light on your phone.

01:15:48.231 --> 01:15:51.607
I think I broke
it when I dropped it.

01:15:51.609 --> 01:15:53.818
We have to get
out of here, now.

01:15:58.615 --> 01:15:59.948
Maybe we
should get help.

01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:01.449
There's no time, Cali.

01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:02.409
The neighbors?

01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:03.618
They're too far away.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:07.247
We have to get Miller
out of here, now.

01:16:07.249 --> 01:16:09.127
I can't see anything.

01:16:22.056 --> 01:16:22.846
It's too dark.

01:16:22.848 --> 01:16:24.390
Stop.

01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:25.890
I dropped my phone over there.

01:16:25.892 --> 01:16:27.728
I think I can find it.

01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:33.669
Ranae?

01:17:35.129 --> 01:17:36.464
There, got it.

01:17:37.923 --> 01:17:38.757
Cali?

01:17:46.182 --> 01:17:47.348
Cali!

01:18:37.357 --> 01:18:38.275
Oh, my god,

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.944
Rose.

01:18:40.945 --> 01:18:41.779
Shh.

01:18:53.665 --> 01:18:55.418
You can't have him.

01:19:03.258 --> 01:19:04.843
You can't have him!

01:21:35.244 --> 01:21:39.162
911,
what's your emergency?

01:21:39.164 --> 01:21:40.332
I need help.

01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:26.393
