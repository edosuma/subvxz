WEBVTT

00:06.302 --> 00:07.135
You did what?

00:07.137 --> 00:09.171
I married April!

00:09.172 --> 00:11.238
I'm sorry? You carried April?

00:11.240 --> 00:12.506
No. I <i>married</i> her.

00:12.508 --> 00:15.076
My brain cannot even process
the fact that you just said

00:15.078 --> 00:17.945
"married," so I'm assuming
you said "carried,"

00:17.947 --> 00:19.380
like over a big puddle.

00:19.382 --> 00:20.614
Yeah, I did carry her...

00:20.616 --> 00:21.649
Oh.

00:21.651 --> 00:23.417
...into the 'Bago after I married her.

00:23.419 --> 00:25.519
Why?! Why? Why? Why? Why?

00:25.521 --> 00:27.021
Why? Why? Why?!

00:27.023 --> 00:28.389
To piss off Mom!

00:28.391 --> 00:31.525
W-W-Wait! You got married
just to make Mom mad?

00:31.527 --> 00:32.368
Yeah.

00:32.393 --> 00:34.261
Well, what did she
say when you told her?

00:34.263 --> 00:36.364
I didn't tell her yet,
'cause she's gonna be mad.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.431
Yeah.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.400
Getting married to make Mom mad
makes sense.

00:39.402 --> 00:41.102
Look, it just happened, okay?

00:41.104 --> 00:42.670
April and I were in the Winnebago,

00:42.672 --> 00:44.171
talking about how her parents
don't like me

00:44.173 --> 00:45.806
and my parents don't like her,
and I don't know.

00:45.808 --> 00:46.687
We just started feeling like,

00:46.689 --> 00:49.010
"Hey, we don't need anybody.
We got each other."

00:49.012 --> 00:50.878
So, the more we talked about it,
the more upset we got,

00:50.880 --> 00:53.080
and next thing I know,
we're at the courthouse

00:53.082 --> 00:54.849
in this really long line.

00:54.851 --> 00:56.484
And it was around then I started
to have second thoughts,

00:56.486 --> 00:58.452
but if we got out of line,
we'd lose our place,

00:58.454 --> 01:00.755
and everyone else in line
was so happy for us,

01:00.757 --> 01:04.291
'cause we're really young
and hot, and they're all so old.

01:04.293 --> 01:06.660
That's because you're too young
to get married!

01:06.662 --> 01:09.230
You were supposed to date
for 2 1/2 years, graduate,

01:09.232 --> 01:11.665
get a job, and then get married
in a small church,

01:11.667 --> 01:13.934
surrounded by God
and your friends and family

01:13.936 --> 01:15.469
and even the cousins
you don't know very well,

01:15.471 --> 01:17.405
and I am a bridesmaid!

01:17.407 --> 01:19.840
Now, I'll just have to be
a bridesmaid for Cindy

01:19.842 --> 01:22.410
and wear a formal dress
and a safari hat!

01:22.412 --> 01:24.245
It's not about you guys.

01:24.247 --> 01:26.547
It's about me and April, and I love her.

01:26.549 --> 01:28.916
Enough to be married
to her forever, like

01:28.918 --> 01:31.318
"till death do you part" love her?

01:34.489 --> 01:37.391
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:37.393 --> 01:38.592
You don't know?!

01:38.594 --> 01:41.629
I don't know, Sue.
Stop nagging me. I got a wife.

01:41.631 --> 01:43.597
Oh, my God! I've got a wife.

01:43.599 --> 01:44.765
Okay. All right.

01:44.767 --> 01:47.268
Let's just take it down for a second.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.670
Okay. Where is April?

01:49.672 --> 01:52.773
Uh, well, after we got married,

01:52.775 --> 01:54.341
we hit a taco truck,

01:54.343 --> 01:56.410
and then I drove her back
to Orson and dropped her off,

01:56.412 --> 01:57.645
'cause she had to work,

01:57.647 --> 01:59.480
but I don't know where she is right now.

02:00.348 --> 02:03.384
Oh, my God. I have a wife
and I have no idea where she is!

02:03.386 --> 02:05.953
Shouldn't I know
where my wife is at all times?

02:05.955 --> 02:08.055
Seriously, Axl, how is this gonna work?

02:08.056 --> 02:09.323
Where are you guys gonna live?

02:09.324 --> 02:10.491
Are you moving in with her?

02:10.493 --> 02:11.759
Is she moving in to the 'Bago?

02:11.761 --> 02:13.060
You guys getting your own place?

02:13.062 --> 02:14.261
Is she gonna take your name?

02:14.263 --> 02:15.996
Are you gonna make her be a Heck?

02:17.199 --> 02:18.666
Oh.

02:20.936 --> 02:23.337
You have to talk to Mom and Dad.

02:23.339 --> 02:25.473
I can't, Sue. I just can't.

02:25.475 --> 02:27.741
Well, you have to. They will understand.

02:27.743 --> 02:29.343
They love you.

02:29.345 --> 02:32.513
A-And, obviously, you're very confused

02:32.515 --> 02:34.448
and conflicted,
because you're hugging me,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.688
and you're not
making any barfing sounds.

02:38.753 --> 02:40.221
Talk to them, Axl.

02:40.223 --> 02:41.989
Ohh.

02:42.958 --> 02:46.127
Oh, hi. Hi. Hi.

02:46.129 --> 02:47.394
Is your mom home?

02:47.396 --> 02:49.797
Um, she didn't say anything
about calling in work

02:49.799 --> 02:51.899
and faking a cold,
so I would go with no.

02:51.901 --> 02:53.200
How about your sister?

02:53.202 --> 02:54.329
- Anyone else home?
- No.

02:54.331 --> 02:55.405
Watch me, Mommy!

02:55.430 --> 02:56.170
- No, watch me!
- Over here, watch me!

02:56.172 --> 02:57.538
No, no. I'm not watching you right now.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.682
I'm talking to this boy.

02:58.684 --> 03:00.975
Hi. How old are you?

03:00.977 --> 03:02.009
15.

03:02.011 --> 03:03.110
You'll do.

03:03.112 --> 03:04.645
I have to take the baby to the doctor.

03:04.647 --> 03:06.614
Would you mind watching the kids
while I'm away?

03:06.616 --> 03:08.182
If I bring them
to the pediatrician's office,

03:08.184 --> 03:09.517
they will tear it to shreds.

03:09.519 --> 03:11.919
I mean, we replaced the fish,
but they're still mad.

03:11.921 --> 03:14.188
But why would they keep cup toys
next to a fish tank?

03:14.190 --> 03:16.357
- Look, Mom, watch me!
- Watch me!

03:16.359 --> 03:18.025
Yeah, I'm watching you!

03:18.027 --> 03:20.094
Uh, I don't think I'm your guy.

03:20.096 --> 03:22.196
- I'm not even allowed to have a hamster.
- Oh, it's fine.

03:22.198 --> 03:24.398
I don't even know where my dog is.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.635
It's fine. It's okay.
It's great. It's fine.

03:27.637 --> 03:29.803
I-I've never babysat before in my life!

03:29.805 --> 03:30.971
It's good. Watch me!

03:30.973 --> 03:33.841
No. The... The boy
is gonna watch you now.

03:33.843 --> 03:35.509
Hey, boy. Hey, boy, look at me!

03:35.511 --> 03:37.077
You might want to watch them.

03:37.079 --> 03:38.612
I'm right here, boy!

03:38.614 --> 03:39.947
Come on!

03:46.621 --> 03:47.688
Hey, buddy, Merry Christmas.

03:47.690 --> 03:48.656
Merry Christmas.

03:48.658 --> 03:50.391
Ah, I got something for you.

03:50.393 --> 03:52.493
Oh. Is this from Paula for Frankie?

03:52.495 --> 03:53.961
No. It's for you.

03:53.963 --> 03:55.396
From who?

03:55.398 --> 03:56.583
Me.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.599
- Why?
- I was at the mall,

03:58.601 --> 04:00.501
and I saw this and thought of you.

04:02.037 --> 04:03.370
Why are you thinking of me?

04:03.372 --> 04:05.472
Come on. Open it.

04:07.842 --> 04:09.674
Sunglasses!

04:10.580 --> 04:11.912
Uh-huh.

04:11.914 --> 04:13.347
You know, I've never seen you
with sunglasses on,

04:13.349 --> 04:15.210
and you're always
kind of squinting, so...

04:15.551 --> 04:17.000
thought you could use them.

04:18.254 --> 04:21.188
Oh. These are nice.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.797
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

04:23.426 --> 04:24.521
Put 'em on.

04:25.027 --> 04:26.460
Nah. It's not that bright out.

04:26.462 --> 04:28.362
You're kind of squinting
a little bit right now.

04:28.364 --> 04:30.130
Come on. Put them on.

04:30.132 --> 04:31.732
I want to see how they look on you.

04:33.101 --> 04:34.435
Nah. I'm fine.

04:34.437 --> 04:35.836
Oh.

04:35.838 --> 04:37.504
All right, then.

04:37.506 --> 04:40.574
Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll see you around.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.920 --> 04:54.989
All right. Sergeant MacKenzie
won the battle,

04:54.991 --> 04:57.157
but the volcano erupted, and now,

04:57.159 --> 04:58.425
there's hot lava everywhere.

04:58.427 --> 04:59.727
Quick! To safety!

04:59.729 --> 05:01.128
Aah! - Aah! - Aah!

05:05.233 --> 05:08.702
Aw, Mom's back, and she wants us
to come home.

05:08.704 --> 05:09.903
- No!
- Grr!

05:09.905 --> 05:12.806
Tell Mom the lava's hot
and we can't leave.

05:12.808 --> 05:14.875
Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah!

05:14.877 --> 05:16.877
Oh, you don't want to keep
your mom waiting.

05:16.879 --> 05:18.679
You probably should go.

05:18.681 --> 05:20.933
Okay. Come on, guys.

05:21.717 --> 05:23.784
I had a lot of fun, Brick.

05:23.786 --> 05:26.587
You must be the most popular kid
in school.

05:27.989 --> 05:30.224
Well, I am in school.

05:33.461 --> 05:35.529
I love you, Brick.

05:42.237 --> 05:45.239
<i>So Brick was feeling
pretty good about himself.</i>

05:45.241 --> 05:48.008
<i>Unfortunately, I hadn't seen
Axl in three weeks,</i>

05:48.010 --> 05:51.345
<i>so I was feeling pretty sorry
for myself.</i>

05:54.650 --> 05:56.150
Oh, good. You're here.

05:56.152 --> 05:57.518
I need help decorating the tree.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.686
I've been so depressed,

05:58.688 --> 06:00.721
I'm eating the popcorn off the garland.

06:00.723 --> 06:03.290
Uh, there's someone on the porch
who wants to see you.

06:03.292 --> 06:04.892
I told that tuba-player kid,

06:04.894 --> 06:06.627
I am not buying his cheese and sausage.

06:06.629 --> 06:09.330
He's gonna have to find another
way to get to the Rose Parade.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.239
Oh, my God!

06:19.241 --> 06:21.008
You're home!

06:22.178 --> 06:25.079
This is the best Christmas present ever!

06:25.081 --> 06:27.614
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

06:27.616 --> 06:29.149
Oh!

06:29.151 --> 06:31.719
Mom, I need to tell
you something, so, listen.

06:31.721 --> 06:33.287
No! I don't want to hear it.

06:33.289 --> 06:35.356
You said things. I said things.

06:35.358 --> 06:37.124
Let's just put it behind us.

06:37.126 --> 06:39.693
You're home, and that is
all I care about. Mwah!

06:39.695 --> 06:41.695
Yeah, well, the reason I'm home is...

06:41.697 --> 06:43.230
The reasons don't matter.

06:43.232 --> 06:45.499
One might. From here
on out, fresh start.

06:45.501 --> 06:46.900
Let's just move forward.

06:46.902 --> 06:48.402
Nothing could ruin this moment.

06:48.404 --> 06:49.703
Oh, it's Christmas,

06:49.705 --> 06:51.505
and Christmas is all about families,

06:51.507 --> 06:54.608
and our family is together again.

06:54.610 --> 06:55.809
You're my favorite.

06:55.811 --> 06:59.012
Oh, Mike! Mike! Our son is back.

06:59.014 --> 07:00.714
Our son is home.

07:00.716 --> 07:01.815
Whoa!

07:02.751 --> 07:04.184
That's okay. I'm all right.

07:07.605 --> 07:11.073
Okay, Mom, which piece
of the Christmas village

07:11.122 --> 07:12.347
do you want to set up next?

07:12.380 --> 07:14.114
Let's do the church, and then
we'll build out from there.

07:14.116 --> 07:15.515
Oh, that's genius!

07:15.518 --> 07:17.952
Oh, thanks for helping me, Axl.

07:17.954 --> 07:19.620
Yeah. You know, I thought
you just wanted to do this

07:19.622 --> 07:20.855
'cause you wanted to put the townspeople

07:20.857 --> 07:22.289
in compromising positions.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.525
Oh, Mom, you know
I've grown out of that.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.827
But, if I hadn't, I'd go with
the baker and the librarian.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.829
She is long overdue.

07:28.831 --> 07:32.633
That's terrible. Hey, what are these?

07:32.635 --> 07:33.868
- They're mine.
- What?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.237
I've never seen
you wear sunglasses before.

07:36.239 --> 07:38.773
Yeah. Bill got them for me...
for Christmas.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.708
Said he was at the mall
thinking about me.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.510
Oh, that's nice.

07:42.512 --> 07:43.577
Is it, though?

07:43.579 --> 07:45.880
It's turning into this whole thing.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.481
Now I got to get something
for Bill, right?

07:47.483 --> 07:48.516
That's the way it works?

07:48.518 --> 07:49.850
That's not necessarily true.

07:49.852 --> 07:50.951
He may have gotten you something

07:50.953 --> 07:52.319
just 'cause he's a kind person.

07:52.321 --> 07:53.687
No. You weren't there.

07:53.689 --> 07:55.156
Got really awkward at the door.

07:55.158 --> 07:56.724
He was just standing there.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.925
Didn't you invite him in?

07:57.927 --> 07:59.927
No. I was thrown.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.762
Well, these are really cool.

08:01.764 --> 08:02.730
Have you tried them on?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.632
No. I'm not playing his game.

08:04.634 --> 08:05.733
And I'll tell you something else...

08:05.735 --> 08:07.835
I'm not getting him anything. I'm out.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.672
Don't ever get married.

08:11.674 --> 08:12.807
Ha!

08:16.345 --> 08:17.745
- Hey!
- Brick, Brick!

08:17.747 --> 08:18.913
- Can you come out and play?!
- Hey, Brick!

08:18.915 --> 08:20.047
- Hi, Brick!
- Hi, Brick!

08:20.049 --> 08:22.349
Brick, can you come out and play?

08:22.351 --> 08:24.451
I'm kind of in the middle of a book.

08:24.453 --> 08:25.986
Can we come in and play?

08:25.988 --> 08:28.155
Again, in the middle
of the aforementioned book,

08:28.157 --> 08:30.257
in which the protagonist
is in quite a pickle.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.793
Can we come in and eat a pickle?

08:32.794 --> 08:35.663
Look, guys, I know I was on fire
the other day.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.063
I gave you a magical experience,

08:37.066 --> 08:38.899
but I just can't do that all the time,

08:38.900 --> 08:40.433
nor do I want to.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.504
Are you too busy doing something
with the popular kids?

08:46.474 --> 08:47.541
Come in.

08:47.543 --> 08:49.777
Yay!

08:51.880 --> 08:53.119
Don't need to know.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.283
What do you think about this for Bill?

08:56.285 --> 08:59.053
It's a bottle opener that plays
the I.U. fight song.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.387
Oh, did Bill go to I.U.?

09:00.389 --> 09:02.189
I don't know. Damn it!

09:02.191 --> 09:04.158
Now I got to find out
where Bill went to college?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.460
He's got me right where he wants
me... thinking about him.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.495
Wait. I didn't think you were
gonna get him a present.

09:08.497 --> 09:10.364
Oh, I'm getting him a present.
I want this debt paid.

09:10.366 --> 09:12.366
I'm settling the score,
once and for all.

09:12.368 --> 09:15.035
Okay, you're buying
him a Christmas gift,

09:15.037 --> 09:16.303
not avenging the death of your father.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.905
Okay. What about this?

09:17.907 --> 09:19.139
A popcorn tin

09:19.141 --> 09:20.908
with cheese-, butter-
and caramel-flavored popcorn?

09:20.910 --> 09:23.410
Uh, I don't know.
It doesn't seem very personal.

09:23.412 --> 09:25.351
I don't want it to be personal.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.181
Bill's already got everything.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.682
It's so hard to buy for a man.

09:28.684 --> 09:30.484
There's a million things
you can buy for a woman.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.519
Which makes your choice
of inflatable foot bath

09:32.521 --> 09:33.854
that much more baffling.

09:33.856 --> 09:35.768
Don't ever get married.

09:38.727 --> 09:40.761
Axl, can I talk to you for a second?

09:40.763 --> 09:42.396
I'm sorry, Sue. We're busy.

09:42.398 --> 09:43.931
And after this, Mom and I

09:43.933 --> 09:45.766
have to snow the Christmas village.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.808
When are you gonna tell Mom
about getting married?

09:54.810 --> 09:56.644
Look, Mom and I are in
a great place right now.

09:56.646 --> 09:59.013
- She's happy.
- You have to do this, Axl.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.147
I can't enjoy Christmas

10:00.149 --> 10:02.516
with this black cloud hanging over it.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.752
It's like "Downton Abbey"
meets "Homeland."

10:04.754 --> 10:06.253
There's a big secret, and eventually,

10:06.255 --> 10:08.155
a bomb is gonna go off.

10:08.157 --> 10:09.924
We're all sitting on a powder keg here!

10:09.926 --> 10:11.392
Oh, get a grip, Sue.

10:11.394 --> 10:12.593
<i>You</i> get a grip!

10:12.595 --> 10:14.929
I can't look Mom in the eye right now.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.563
I'm horrible at keeping secrets.

10:16.565 --> 10:17.898
You know that.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.700
Mom and Dad are fixing
your transmission for Christmas.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.803
Aw, I wanted that Japanese robot dog.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.571
Said the married man.

10:24.573 --> 10:26.807
Look, you need to talk to Mom and Dad.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.809
You need a plan, Axl,

10:28.811 --> 10:30.544
unless you have it all figured out.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.046
Are you gonna stay married?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.781
Have you talked to April?
What is she thinking?

10:33.783 --> 10:35.249
What are you gonna do about Christmas?

10:35.251 --> 10:37.551
Are you going over to April's
place, or is she coming here?

10:37.553 --> 10:39.820
As I have said before,
I do not currently know

10:39.822 --> 10:41.634
the location of my wife.

10:41.791 --> 10:43.410
The cocoa's ready!

10:45.361 --> 10:47.861
Talk... to... her.

10:47.863 --> 10:49.697
I will, okay? I will.

10:49.699 --> 10:51.298
Just not while she's holding hot cocoa.

10:58.306 --> 11:00.074
Brick!

11:00.076 --> 11:01.342
- Brick!
- Brick!

11:01.344 --> 11:02.776
- Brick!
- Brick!

11:02.778 --> 11:04.445
- Brick!
- Brick!

11:04.447 --> 11:05.879
- Brick!
- Brick!

11:05.881 --> 11:08.248
How much do you think
something like this would cost?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.416
$40.45?

11:09.418 --> 11:10.651
Really? That much?

11:10.653 --> 11:13.220
Well, the case said that
it has titanium nose pads

11:13.222 --> 11:15.990
and full-spectrum UVA/UVB protection.

11:15.992 --> 11:18.158
That bastard.

11:30.495 --> 11:33.564
And this is the ornament
you made me in the 5th grade.

11:33.566 --> 11:36.066
Well, actually,
I came to volunteer that day,

11:36.068 --> 11:37.368
and you just ran around, and <i>I</i> made it.

11:37.370 --> 11:38.869
Oh, yeah.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.237
This is so great, Axl.

11:40.239 --> 11:41.505
But, seriously, I know there must

11:41.507 --> 11:42.773
be other things you want to do.

11:42.775 --> 11:44.008
What? Are you kidding me?

11:44.010 --> 11:45.309
I love decorating the tree.

11:45.311 --> 11:47.111
I don't know why
I ever thought this was lame.

11:47.113 --> 11:48.679
- It's great.
- Aww.

11:48.681 --> 11:51.782
Well, you were a teenager,
and teenagers do dumb things.

11:51.784 --> 11:54.781
Yeah, well, even people over 21
do dumb things.

11:54.783 --> 11:55.519
Tell me about it.

11:55.521 --> 11:57.087
Like the time I bought the glue-on nails

11:57.089 --> 11:58.155
at the gas station.

11:58.157 --> 11:59.890
Luckily, the numbness
stopped at the elbows.

11:59.892 --> 12:01.525
Oh, right.

12:02.927 --> 12:04.728
Hey, Sue, come on! Look at the tree!

12:04.730 --> 12:07.331
Oh, it's amazing!

12:07.333 --> 12:09.633
You two must be really proud of
everything you've accomplished

12:09.635 --> 12:10.968
what with all the other things

12:10.970 --> 12:12.495
that need to get done around here.

12:13.172 --> 12:14.938
Well, you've got to come around
and look at the whole thing.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.907
No, no, no. I-I can picture it.

12:16.909 --> 12:18.642
I am just glad

12:18.644 --> 12:21.545
everyone is having
a very merry Christmas.

12:21.547 --> 12:23.580
Nobody's having heartburn,

12:23.582 --> 12:25.282
no random vomiting

12:25.284 --> 12:26.917
or twisting your hair till it
falls right out of your head.

12:26.919 --> 12:28.786
That is awesome!

12:28.788 --> 12:31.789
I am thrilled that you two

12:31.791 --> 12:34.024
are free to enjoy
the wonders of the season.

12:38.597 --> 12:40.331
- Hmm.
- Still a teenager.

12:44.602 --> 12:46.470
Code blue! Code blue!

12:46.472 --> 12:48.605
Try the door!

12:48.607 --> 12:50.007
- Hi, Brick!
- Let's make a fort!

12:50.009 --> 12:51.308
Let's go through your stuff!

12:51.310 --> 12:53.510
Yay!

12:57.415 --> 12:58.515
Knock, knock.

12:58.517 --> 13:00.851
Oh, Sue. Were you praying?

13:00.853 --> 13:02.019
No. No.

13:02.021 --> 13:03.787
I'm just looking for something
under my bed.

13:03.789 --> 13:04.955
Nope, not there.

13:04.957 --> 13:07.598
Hey, um, can I talk to you for a minute?

13:08.127 --> 13:09.574
Sure.

13:10.162 --> 13:12.275
Hey, is that poster crooked?

13:12.698 --> 13:15.444
Sue, honey...

13:15.835 --> 13:17.368
I know what's going on here.

13:17.370 --> 13:18.669
- You do?
- Yeah.

13:18.671 --> 13:20.003
Don't worry.

13:20.005 --> 13:21.438
It's perfectly natural

13:21.440 --> 13:23.688
for you to be jealous of your brother.

13:24.310 --> 13:26.877
I know I've been spending
a lot of time with Axl,

13:26.879 --> 13:29.346
but it's only because
our relationship was so strained

13:29.348 --> 13:30.981
and we are both so happy to be able

13:30.983 --> 13:32.082
to put that all behind us.

13:33.252 --> 13:35.919
Sue, would you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

13:35.921 --> 13:37.221
I thought I was.

13:37.223 --> 13:39.189
Look, the point is, no matter what,

13:39.191 --> 13:41.558
you're my only daughter,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.628
and we will always share
a very special bond.

13:44.630 --> 13:47.931
Mom! The reindeer cookies
are ready for frosting!

13:47.933 --> 13:49.099
Axl needs me.

13:50.268 --> 13:51.402
Coming!

13:51.404 --> 13:52.903
Ugh! Ohh.

13:52.905 --> 13:55.172
<i>So, in order to get away
from the Peterson kids,</i>

13:55.174 --> 13:57.641
<i>Brick took refuge at the library.</i>

13:57.643 --> 13:59.943
<i>The tricky part was coming back home.</i>

13:59.945 --> 14:01.478
Oh, no.

14:08.386 --> 14:09.653
Oh, sorry.

14:09.655 --> 14:12.089
Wait. Were you trying on the sunglasses?

14:12.091 --> 14:13.457
- No.
- Yes, you were.

14:13.459 --> 14:14.625
Put them back on so I can see.

14:14.627 --> 14:15.859
Eh, that's okay.

14:15.861 --> 14:18.262
Come on. I had to pick
that weird thing off your back.

14:18.264 --> 14:20.063
We have no secrets.

14:21.634 --> 14:24.234
Ooh, I like them.

14:24.236 --> 14:27.171
- They make you look like a sexy cop.
- Oh, really?

14:27.173 --> 14:29.206
'Cause I was thinking more
of an Italian racecar driver.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.275
Mm-hmm. Or maybe an airline pilot.

14:31.277 --> 14:33.811
How long is your layover, Captain Heck?

14:33.813 --> 14:36.346
Wow, I can't believe you've
never worn sunglasses before.

14:36.348 --> 14:37.581
You look great in them.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.917
I know. It sucks.
I <i>do</i> look great in them.

14:39.919 --> 14:42.052
This whole thing is pissing me off.

14:42.054 --> 14:44.455
Bill got me the best gift. He nailed it.

14:44.457 --> 14:45.789
Now I got to do something just as good

14:45.791 --> 14:47.024
or I look like a jerk.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.159
What are you gonna do?

14:49.161 --> 14:52.629
I don't know! I saw this
dispenser thing for a shower.

14:52.631 --> 14:53.864
It's got compartments

14:53.866 --> 14:55.933
for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

14:55.935 --> 14:57.201
I don't know, but Bill seems like

14:57.203 --> 14:59.303
he might be a body wash go... Damn it!

14:59.305 --> 15:00.904
I've never said "body wash" in my life,

15:00.906 --> 15:02.105
and now I've said it twice.

15:02.107 --> 15:04.141
This ends now.

15:06.946 --> 15:08.612
How much were they?

15:08.614 --> 15:10.147
- What?
- The sunglasses.

15:10.149 --> 15:11.482
I tried to get you a good present,

15:11.484 --> 15:13.283
I couldn't find anything,
so I'm just gonna give you cash.

15:13.285 --> 15:15.085
- How much?
- No, Mike, they were a present.

15:15.087 --> 15:17.654
- You don't have to...
- Let's not belabor it, okay?

15:17.656 --> 15:19.490
How much?

15:19.492 --> 15:21.458
- 42 bucks.
- That include tax?

15:21.460 --> 15:22.960
Really, Mike?

15:22.962 --> 15:23.861
Yeah, really.

15:23.863 --> 15:24.962
Just give me the grand total

15:24.964 --> 15:26.841
and this whole nightmare can be over.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.399
$42.50.

15:29.401 --> 15:31.134
No, $44.32.

15:31.136 --> 15:32.503
Okay.

15:32.505 --> 15:35.105
$45. Keep the change.

15:40.112 --> 15:43.080
Hey, Mike, you never told me...

15:43.082 --> 15:44.314
do you like them?

15:45.817 --> 15:47.484
I love 'em.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.126
<i>Just when I thought Christmas
couldn't get any better,</i>

15:56.128 --> 15:58.962
<i>out of the blue,
Axl suggested we drive around</i>

15:58.964 --> 16:01.231
<i>and see the Christmas lights
in Orson Heights.</i>

16:01.233 --> 16:03.433
<i>We hadn't done that
since the kids were little.</i>

16:03.435 --> 16:05.469
<i>I was beside myself.</i>

16:05.471 --> 16:07.004
Mom, look at the penguins

16:07.006 --> 16:09.273
- on that Ferris wheel!
- Oh, I love that.

16:09.275 --> 16:10.974
We should try to do something
like that next year.

16:10.976 --> 16:12.109
Yeah, we're not doing that.

16:12.111 --> 16:13.710
Oh, and look at those reindeer!

16:13.712 --> 16:15.746
They've got their heads moving
like they're grazing!

16:15.748 --> 16:16.914
We're not doing that.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.916
Now, those people
have the Colts logo lit up.

16:18.918 --> 16:20.551
<i>- That</i> we can do.
- Yeah.

16:20.553 --> 16:23.320
Well, this is nice...
everybody in the car, together.

16:23.322 --> 16:24.488
How about we play a game?

16:24.490 --> 16:26.990
We'll call it "What's new in your life?"

16:26.992 --> 16:29.426
I reversed my reversible comforter.

16:29.428 --> 16:30.594
Next.

16:30.596 --> 16:31.461
I got new sunglasses.

16:31.463 --> 16:32.529
Dad, it's not your turn.

16:32.531 --> 16:34.031
Any recent changes in your life, Axl?

16:34.033 --> 16:36.033
I have a newfound appreciation

16:36.035 --> 16:38.502
for the holidays and my mother.

16:40.605 --> 16:41.638
Oh, no.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.873
Gracie Peterson texted me

16:42.875 --> 16:44.508
asking me what time we'll be home.

16:44.510 --> 16:46.109
That's it. We got to move.

16:46.111 --> 16:48.812
Come on, Brick.
They like you, and they're cute.

16:48.814 --> 16:50.847
They're cute until
they won't leave you alone.

16:50.849 --> 16:52.516
I was in the snowbank for five hours

16:52.518 --> 16:54.551
and got frostbite
on my page-turning finger.

16:54.553 --> 16:55.986
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,
whatever, whatever.

16:55.988 --> 16:57.454
Okay, new game.

16:57.456 --> 16:59.690
Everyone say something nobody else knows

16:59.692 --> 17:00.958
that you feel bad about

17:00.960 --> 17:03.410
but you'll feel better after you say it.

17:03.629 --> 17:05.295
I used Dad's toothbrush.

17:05.297 --> 17:06.195
What?

17:06.198 --> 17:08.031
Not in my mouth.

17:08.032 --> 17:09.031
Boy, that's a load off.

17:09.034 --> 17:10.934
Not your turn! Axl!

17:10.935 --> 17:12.269
Can't think of a thing.

17:12.271 --> 17:13.704
Okay, I got one.

17:13.705 --> 17:15.705
When there were free refills,
I got root beer

17:15.708 --> 17:17.473
even though my original pop was orange.

17:17.476 --> 17:19.242
Axl, did you think of anything?
Anything at all?

17:19.243 --> 17:20.978
I don't like this game, Sue.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.579
Well, we can play something else.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.247
I'm not married to it.

17:24.249 --> 17:25.715
You know what?

17:25.718 --> 17:28.085
I've just got to to say,
with my family all together,

17:28.087 --> 17:31.388
I'm just so filled
with a sense of joy and peace.

17:31.390 --> 17:33.724
This may be the best Christmas ever.

17:34.660 --> 17:35.792
Oh, no!

17:35.794 --> 17:38.128
If that's Gracie, tell her I'm not here.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.163
Hello?

17:40.165 --> 17:41.999
Oh, hi!

17:42.001 --> 17:45.102
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:45.104 --> 17:46.970
I did not know that.

17:46.972 --> 17:48.905
Yeah, of course we'll be there.

17:48.907 --> 17:51.642
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too.

17:52.845 --> 17:54.378
- You got married?!
- Whoa.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.946
- You idiot!
- Wait. What?!

17:55.948 --> 17:57.514
- Uh-oh.
- He married her, Mike.

17:57.516 --> 17:58.882
He married April!

17:58.884 --> 17:59.950
- Yeah.
- Damn it, Axl!

17:59.952 --> 18:01.284
- Ow!
- I am gonna kill you!

18:01.286 --> 18:02.386
- That was April's mom on the phone.
- Stop, please, ow.

18:02.388 --> 18:03.754
- Stop her!
- I had to hear it from her!

18:03.756 --> 18:05.255
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

18:05.257 --> 18:06.923
Oh, God, oh, God!

18:06.925 --> 18:08.659
What the hell were you thinking?!

18:08.661 --> 18:10.460
I wasn't thinking...
you should know that!

18:10.462 --> 18:11.728
I'm very vulnerable!

18:11.730 --> 18:14.398
Well, I sent you that dirty
carrot, and you ignored it!

18:14.400 --> 18:17.000
Hey, hold on! Hold on, hold on.

18:17.002 --> 18:18.502
Did you have to marry her?

18:18.504 --> 18:20.737
- No.
- That makes it worse!

18:20.739 --> 18:21.838
Hey!

18:21.840 --> 18:23.440
I told him to tell you!

18:23.442 --> 18:26.043
I was the only one who knew!
It was killing me!

18:26.045 --> 18:29.646
I stress-chewed my cheeks
till they're hamburger!

18:30.114 --> 18:31.615
No! You get away from those Wise Men!

18:31.617 --> 18:33.750
You've got no business
being around Wise Men.

18:33.752 --> 18:34.951
I wanted to tell you guys,

18:34.953 --> 18:36.520
but I didn't want
to ruin your Christmas.

18:36.522 --> 18:37.888
That ship has sailed.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.556
I can't believe you did this!

18:39.558 --> 18:41.258
You got married
and you didn't even tell me?

18:41.260 --> 18:42.659
You didn't even invite me!

18:42.661 --> 18:44.628
I know I would've been stuck
wearing a stupid yellow dress

18:44.630 --> 18:46.363
'cause that's what
always happens to boy moms.

18:46.365 --> 18:47.998
We always are the last to find out!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.467
But I didn't think I would be
the <i>very</i> last to find out!

18:50.469 --> 18:52.803
Okay, if you'll just let me
talk, I can explain.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.271
Great. Talk.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.406
I... Uunnngh!

18:56.408 --> 18:57.641
Get him, Brick!

18:59.411 --> 19:00.477
Sue!

19:01.279 --> 19:02.679
Oh, gee!

19:04.383 --> 19:06.283
- Where you going, Axl, huh, huh?
- Get up, fool.

19:06.285 --> 19:08.719
- I told him to tell you!
- No, please, listen, I can explain!

19:08.721 --> 19:11.888
You kids are not going over
to that boy's house ever again.

19:11.890 --> 19:13.623
Hey, come on!

19:16.448 --> 19:18.114
All right.

19:18.139 --> 19:20.239
So, what do you want to do, Axl?

19:20.241 --> 19:22.074
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

19:22.076 --> 19:23.342
Do you love April?

19:23.344 --> 19:24.744
Yeah, I love her.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.046
I just don't know if I wife love her.

19:27.048 --> 19:28.848
Well, if you don't love her now,

19:28.850 --> 19:31.484
there is no way in hell
you're gonna love her later.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.181
Look, I'm just dumb, all right?

19:33.183 --> 19:34.153
I'm really dumb.

19:34.155 --> 19:35.488
I got swept up in the moment,

19:35.490 --> 19:37.823
but I am still in college...
I've got to graduate.

19:37.825 --> 19:39.725
I mean, April picks up
golf balls for a living,

19:39.727 --> 19:40.993
and my house is a Winnebago.

19:40.995 --> 19:42.461
Oh, God.

19:42.463 --> 19:44.430
I'm starting to think
I did not think this through.

19:44.432 --> 19:46.532
But, on the other hand,
she is kind of amazing.

19:46.534 --> 19:48.334
I mean, she makes me laugh,
and she looks like...

19:48.336 --> 19:51.103
well, you've seen her...
an angel, right?

19:51.105 --> 19:53.206
Oh, God, I don't know! I don't know.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.775
I just... I need you guys
to tell me what to do.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.710
I'd say that if you
need to ask your parents

19:57.712 --> 19:59.011
if you should be married,

19:59.013 --> 20:00.546
you probably shouldn't be married.

20:01.682 --> 20:03.816
Okay, I've researched
grounds for annulment

20:03.818 --> 20:05.184
in the state of Indiana.

20:05.186 --> 20:09.455
There's not being of legal age,
suspicion of fraud,

20:09.457 --> 20:11.657
if one or both of the parties
are mentally unstable...

20:11.659 --> 20:12.858
- Bingo!
- That one.

20:17.397 --> 20:18.731
I'm gonna kill her.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.132
She's such an idiot.

20:20.134 --> 20:23.035
He's got her beat
at being an idiot all day long.

20:23.037 --> 20:24.203
But we love Axl.

20:24.205 --> 20:27.139
Oh, and we love April. She's a delight.

20:27.808 --> 20:29.875
Okay, done.

20:29.877 --> 20:33.279
Well, I seem to find myself
recently single.

20:33.281 --> 20:35.815
You want to maybe, uh, go on a date?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.451
You know, grab a slice of pizza
or something?

20:38.453 --> 20:39.752
I do.

20:39.754 --> 20:42.521
I mean, I'd like that.

20:44.758 --> 20:46.158
<i>So, that Christmas,</i>

20:46.160 --> 20:48.194
<i>instead of getting Axl
a new transmission,</i>

20:48.196 --> 20:50.229
<i>we got him an annulment.</i>

20:50.231 --> 20:52.498
<i>Sue got her family back,</i>

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
<i>Brick got a little peace,</i>

20:54.502 --> 20:57.837
<i>and I got pulled over by a cop...</i>

20:57.839 --> 20:59.171
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>
