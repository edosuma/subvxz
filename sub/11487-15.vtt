00:01.680 --> 00:03.432
You know
what l've been thinking about?

00:03.600 --> 00:06.273
-What?
-The death penalty.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.232
Really? That's a--
That's a very complex issue.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.118
So-- So, what are your thoughts?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.999
lf you're going to the chair
they give you what you want. . .

00:15.160 --> 00:16.479
. . .for your last meal.

00:16.640 --> 00:17.959
l guess.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.874
-l'm gonna order cereal.
-Why?

00:22.040 --> 00:25.874
Because if you keep adding milk
you can make it last forever.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.239
And they just gotta wait.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.791
Okay, let's go back a bit.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.838
Why would you be going to the chair
in the first place?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.436
l don't know.
My DNA shows up at a murder scene. . .

00:38.760 --> 00:42.673
. . .because it's planted by a crooked cop
or maybe one of my teachers.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.835
-So you'd be wrongly accused?
-Story of my life, Dad.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.514
Remember that water pistol incident
at school?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.352
But that was your water pistol.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.273
Yes, but it wasn't my pee.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.873
Morning.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.268
Oh, hey, how was your run?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.908
Great. We made it
all the way to the pier and back.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.876
Didn't we, honey?

01:06.360 --> 01:07.952
Yeah.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.470
Pier. Back.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.795
Hey, Jake,
you ever seen anybody cough up blood?

01:14.760 --> 01:16.671
-Nope.
-Then pay attention.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.591
-Ass.
-Ass?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.438
Kiss.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.712
My.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.311
Sweaty.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.836
l think l'll jump in the shower.
Wanna join me?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.592
Can't.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.633
Later.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.472
Maybe.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.839
All right. Well,
you drink your health shake, all right?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.514
-You'll feel better.
-Doubt it.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.718
-What's in that?
-l don't know.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.110
Vitamins, minerals, protein.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.556
Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff
l ate in high school.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.874
Hey, do you think they let you
have a last poop after your last meal?

02:07.560 --> 02:08.595
What?

02:08.759 --> 02:10.955
Because as long as you're sitting on
the can. . .

02:11.120 --> 02:13.429
. . .technically you're still pooping.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.753
And they gotta wait.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.875
Go get dressed.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.597
lf they made you hold one in,
that'd be cruel and unusual punishment.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.589
You know, l am impressed
with what you're doing here.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.275
Exercising, eating right,
laying off the cigars and the booze.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.510
l mean,
Mia has really done wonders with you.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.591
-Yeah, she's an incredible woman.
-She is.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.352
-And l'm a lucky guy.
-You are.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.511
Why is there
this little voice in my head. . .

02:40.680 --> 02:43.717
. . .that keeps whispering,
''Kill yourself. Do it now. ''

02:45.000 --> 02:46.672
Don't worry about that. lt's common.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.829
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.549
Every man who gets into a long-term,
committed relationship hears that voice.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.075
Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.275
l don't know why.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.874
Maybe because l enjoyed him
in that submarine movie.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.669
-What was that call--?
-Would you get to the point?

03:00.840 --> 03:03.479
You have to remember that over time
that voice will fade. . .

03:03.640 --> 03:05.517
. . .when you realize
what you're giving up. . .

03:05.680 --> 03:07.636
. . .is nothing compared
to what you're gaining.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.518
What exactly am l gaining?

03:09.680 --> 03:11.671
Are you kidding?
You're gaining a soul mate.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.956
Someone to walk down life's path
with you.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.509
Someone who'll always be there,
sharing your hopes. . .

03:16.680 --> 03:18.716
. . .your joys and your sorrows.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.359
You got nothing.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.708
That's what the minister said
at my wedding.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.316
Hunt for Red October.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.199
Be back in a while, honey.
l'm going for a power walk.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.796
-Pace yourself.
-Don't worry.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:37.080 --> 04:39.878
This is a good pace.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.032
Hey.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.198
What you doing?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.032
Nothing. Close the damn door.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.668
You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke
or drink anymore.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.199
You told your father you weren't gonna
watch dirty movies on cable anymore.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.876
Don't change the subject.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.395
Mia's gonna be really pissed at you.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.472
Only if she finds out
and she doesn't have to find out.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.313
Well, l guess that depends.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.079
What, are you blackmailing me?

05:17.240 --> 05:19.800
No. l'm just saying
if you don't give me 20 bucks. . .

05:19.960 --> 05:21.712
. . .l'm gonna tell on you.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.792
That's blackmail.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.233
Well, then, yeah.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.397
-Oh, hi, Mom, how are you?
-Deeply hurt.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.439
ls this about me or Charlie?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.352
-Charlie.
-Great. Come on in.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.714
Can you explain to me how your brother
can be in a serious relationship. . .

05:47.880 --> 05:49.836
. . .and not only
have l not met the woman. . .

05:50.000 --> 05:52.560
. . .he hasn't even bothered
to tell me her name?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.676
Do you really need an explanation
for that?

05:54.840 --> 05:56.432
Do you want it to be about you?

05:56.960 --> 05:59.952
-Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen.
-Thank you.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.111
Thank God l didn't know Anne Frank.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.429
Hello.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.033
Hello.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.869
-l'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother.
-l'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.358
-So we finally meet.
-So we do.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.829
One question.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.478
-l'm listening.
-Can you fix him?

06:30.200 --> 06:31.315
l'm trying.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.471
Fifteen, 1 6, 1 7, 1 8--

06:37.640 --> 06:39.198
Jake?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.237
How about a hug
for your grandmommy?

06:41.560 --> 06:43.357
No, thank you.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.072
One, two--

06:54.640 --> 06:56.596
What the hell are you doing?

06:56.760 --> 06:58.910
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down.
Keep it down.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.957
Mia thinks l'm taking a power walk.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.553
This is a sad, sad day.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.748
l always figured
you'd be the last guy in the world. . .

07:09.920 --> 07:11.990
. . .to end up whipped.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.312
l am not whipped. l'm considerate.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.712
-Considerate?
-Yeah.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.757
See, l love Mia
and want her to be happy.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.480
l happen to know she's not happy
when l smoke cigars. . .

07:22.640 --> 07:25.074
. . .and drink and gamble
and stay out all night. . .

07:25.240 --> 07:29.597
. . .and eat meat and sugar and grease
and fat and nap and swear. . .

07:29.760 --> 07:31.751
. . .and wear shorts
and bowling shirts. . . .

07:31.920 --> 07:35.276
Charlie, you ain't just whipped,
you're roped, saddled and gelded.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.069
They could use you
to give rides at kid's birthday parties.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.038
-l am not whipped.
-Yeah.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.189
Here, might as well take one
of these sacks since yours is empty.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.794
Hang on a second.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.157
-That ain't gonna do it, Alice.
-What?

07:52.320 --> 07:55.471
You smell like a beer bottle
that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.113
Well, what am l supposed to do?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.714
Oh, hang on,
let's see if l got anything in here. . .

08:00.880 --> 08:03.519
. . .that might mask your stench.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.398
Oven cleaner. No.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.315
Ty-D-Bol. No.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.756
How do you feel about taking a whore's
bath with a hunk of blue cheese?

08:13.400 --> 08:16.392
l'm so proud of him. He hasn't had
a drop of alcohol in weeks.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.391
Well, that's one way to go.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.758
But l've found that men who drink
tend to talk less and sleep more.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.789
Which, frankly,
becomes increasingly desirable. . .

08:25.960 --> 08:27.678
. . .as the years go by.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.356
Oh, this can't be good.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.429
Hello, darling. Wonderful to see you.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.078
Hi, Mom.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.833
Have you been dusting?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.591
-No, why?
-You reek of Lemon Pledge.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.955
You're welcome.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.631
l'll be downstairs.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.438
No snacking, Charlie.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.068
We're going to
the best vegetarian restaurant in town.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.677
Oh, boy.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.755
Oh, thank God. Meat.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.117
-l love you, Rose.
-l love you too, Charlie.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.397
And may l say, l would never
try to change you the way she has.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.275
-Her name's Mia.
-l know what her name is.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.908
l also know where she lives,
her employment history. . .

09:29.080 --> 09:32.470
. . .and if you want l can get you
photographs of a wet T-shirt contest. . .

09:32.640 --> 09:38.158
. . .she entered during spring break 1 995
at a college bar called SeÃ±or Frogs.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.078
l forgot who l'm dealing with.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.231
l know you have to hide
to smoke a cigar. . .

09:42.400 --> 09:44.038
. . .and slam back a warm beer.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.719
What'd you do, bug my garage?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.029
Don't be paranoid.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.270
l have a long-standing arrangement
with Jake.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.475
Charlie, l'm ready.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.075
l'm out here.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.196
Go, go, go.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.079
Okay, l'll go,
but l want you to remember one thing.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.356
-What?
-l'm not gonna wait for you forever.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.598
How do l look?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.189
How's your couscous?

10:26.480 --> 10:27.959
Yum, yum.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.870
l had an interesting chat
with your mom today.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.110
Yeah, l'm sorry about that.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.989
l know she comes on a little strong
but her heart's in the right place.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.358
lf you mean in a cooler on its way to a
dying man in Tennessee, then we agree.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.191
-You can't possibly mean that.
-l suppose not.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.079
She's too selfish to donate an organ.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.674
Even one she doesn't use.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.555
That's so unfair, Charlie.
Your mother loves you.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.191
Really? Did she or did she not say
l was a bitter disappointment?

10:56.920 --> 10:58.956
-Well, she did, but--
-And did she. . .

10:59.120 --> 11:02.510
. . .or did she not say that
l'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer. . .

11:02.680 --> 11:05.592
. . .who wasted 1 3 years of piano lessons
that she paid for. . .

11:05.760 --> 11:08.911
. . .by marrying a series of men
with large wallets and small penises?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.272
Yes, that was mentioned.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.474
lt's natural for someone who loves you
to want to see you live to your potential.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.589
Do you want to be known as the guy
who writes songs about adult diapers?

11:20.920 --> 11:23.718
Hey, it's better than being known
as the guy who wears them.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.950
Charlie, we both know
you can do so much more with your life.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.553
Maybe.
But you gotta admire my restraint.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.909
Oh, come on, look how much you've
accomplished since we've been together.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.038
You're exercising regularly,
you cut way down on the drinking. . .

11:41.200 --> 11:42.599
. . .and you're eating right.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.672
Did you ever think you'd
change your life the way you have?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.353
Never.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.797
lt just goes to show, you can do
anything you put your mind to.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.917
l smell meat.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.789
Excuse me?

12:00.280 --> 12:02.555
Your breath. lt stinks of meat.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.990
Well, it could be my tongue.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.713
My tongue is meat.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.474
No, you've been eating meat.
l can smell it.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.630
Maybe it's this breast of Tofurky
you smell.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.590
-No, l smell beef.
-Where would l get beef?

12:21.760 --> 12:22.875
You tell me.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.592
Well, maybe it's secondhand beef.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.992
-What?
-You know, like secondhand smoke.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.354
Some thoughtless guy. . .

12:31.520 --> 12:34.398
. . .who's sitting next to you
eating a steak can--

12:37.000 --> 12:39.150
Oh, screw it.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.311
l paid a slightly disturbed woman
to toss a bag of cheeseburgers. . .

12:43.480 --> 12:45.675
. . .onto the deck
while you were getting dressed.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.831
-Oh, Charlie.
-Don't ''Oh, Charlie'' me, l was starving.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.230
And l'll tell you another thing,
my power walk. . .

12:53.400 --> 12:57.518
. . .was two quick beers and half a Cuban
cigar while cowering in my own garage.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.477
That's why you smelt like
Lemon Pledge.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.076
Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out
the natural luster of my forehead.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.514
So you've been lying to me?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.037
lf you mean telling you
l wasn't going to do a bunch of things. . .

13:08.200 --> 13:12.193
. . .then doing them anyway and lying
about it, then l've been lying to you.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.399
Well, l suppose l can forgive you.
lf you promise it'll never happen again.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.596
Oh, it'll never happen again.
You know why?

13:19.760 --> 13:22.638
Because l am done
with this whole charade.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.792
l'm tired of you trying
to make me over into something l'm not.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.837
l'm a grown man,
not a work in progress.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.195
-Charlie, people are staring.
-Let them stare.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.559
You guys know what l mean.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.950
Why can't women
look at a guy for who he is. . .

13:35.120 --> 13:36.997
. . .instead of
who they can turn him into?

13:37.160 --> 13:38.912
-Please, you're embarrassing me.
-Good.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.513
Maybe now you know how l feel.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.468
Sitting in a restaurant eating medallions
of bean curd with lawn mower sauce.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.589
Am l right?

13:47.080 --> 13:50.789
No man should have to eat anything
with the word ''curd'' in it.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.190
You know,
you're turning into a real ass here.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.193
Well,
then l'm finally living up to my potential.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.797
l'm a big old bourbon-soaked,
cigar-huffing ass. . .

13:59.960 --> 14:02.394
. . .as God, in his infinite wisdom,
meant me to be.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.471
As he meant all men to be.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.072
You guys are disappointing God.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.076
Okay,
what if a cannibal was on death row?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.277
l guess for being a cannibal.

14:26.960 --> 14:31.112
And he orders Chinese for his last meal,
does he get to eat a Chinese guy?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.475
No.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.470
What if they
just electrocuted a Chinese guy. . .

14:37.640 --> 14:39.232
. . .and the cannibal was next?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.793
No.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.990
-He'd already be cooked.
-Stop it.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.949
-Hey.
-Hey, where have you been?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.953
-l had a date with Mia.
-That was two nights ago.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.271
Yeah, well,
l stopped off in Vegas on the way home.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.032
Why?

14:58.200 --> 15:02.352
Because that's where you go
after you destroy a relationship.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.838
Oh, now l understand
why Mia's been calling.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.356
-She sounded pretty upset.
-l didn't tell her anything.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.752
But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.553
Hey, you just paid me once.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.439
Rose has me
on something called a ''retainer. ''

15:18.880 --> 15:21.348
-So, what happened with Mia?
-No big deal.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.988
l just got tired
of trying to be something l'm not.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.833
-A decent, healthy human being?
-Pretty much.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.830
He's back.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.754
You're damn right l'm back.
Mia and l are through.

15:35.920 --> 15:39.071
You schmuck. She was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.912
But you said l was whipped.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.878
l didn't mean dump her,
l meant grow a pair.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.838
What is ''whipped''?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.072
When a man lets a woman take over
his life and tell him what to do.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.151
Oh, so like you and Mom.

15:56.680 --> 15:57.669
No.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.151
Oh, hi, Mother.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.914
No, no, Mia's not here.
He broke up with her.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.592
Yeah, schmuck seems to be
the general consensus.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.953
-What's a ''schmuck''?
-Any guy who's not whipped.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.157
-She wants to talk to you.
-Well, l don't wanna talk to her.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.073
Nice catch, schmuck.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.194
Hi, Mom.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.794
Why am l the bad guy here?

16:29.960 --> 16:33.714
Well, did you ever stop to consider
that maybe this wasn't my fault?

16:33.880 --> 16:36.030
l gotta go, Mom,
my meat connection's here.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.558
lt's just weird. l just think that if the guy's
got a front door, we should use it.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.517
-This is fine.
-Okay.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.433
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hello, Rose. What's going on?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.914
Well, l just wanted to introduce you
to Gordon, my new boyfriend.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.079
Oh, no kidding. Hi, Gordon.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.355
Hello.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.114
Gordon and l
are in a committed relationship.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.759
-Right, Gordon?
-Yeah, l guess.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.275
Look, see,
there's stairs right over there. Just--

17:04.440 --> 17:06.112
Anyway. . .

17:06.280 --> 17:07.998
. . .l was thinking that you and Mia. . .

17:08.160 --> 17:11.357
. . .would like to join us for dinner
one night. You know, double date.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.634
Oh, well, that's nice, Rose,
but l broke up with Mia.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.438
Oh, l see.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.358
Well, then goodbye, Gordon.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.788
l think l made a big mistake.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.632
l know the feeling.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.713
l once ate an egg salad sandwich
l left in my desk over the weekend.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.111
Huge mistake.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.159
My relationship with Mia. . .

17:48.320 --> 17:51.232
. . .was the best thing that happened
to me and l threw it away.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.160
That's what l should have done
with the sandwich.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.395
l wonder if it's too late to fix things.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.278
Call her and find out.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.715
But if l do,
l'll be right back where l started. . .

18:01.880 --> 18:04.110
. . .trying to be somebody l'm not.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.077
Okay, then find another girlfriend.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.312
l don't want another girlfriend.
l want Mia.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.357
Then call her.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.398
l can't.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.233
l can't live with her,
l can't live without her.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.871
lf your plane crashed in the Andes
and she died, could you eat her?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.276
Mia, it's Charlie.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.638
Look, you win. l'll change.
No more meat, l promise.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.508
Come on, Mia.
Come out and smell me.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.471
Mia's not here.
Do l have to smell you?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.792
-Who are you?
-Ginger.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.279
So you're Charlie.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.069
-Yeah, where's Mia?
-Hang on a minute.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.632
She told me to give you this
if you stopped by.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.510
She took a job in New York?
Why'd she do that?

19:05.680 --> 19:06.999
Just read the note.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.791
''l love you too much to try to make you
into something you're not. . .

19:10.960 --> 19:14.475
. . .and l love me too much
to settle for who you are. ''

19:14.640 --> 19:17.029
That's the part
that always makes me cry.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.269
l can change her mind.
l'll fly to New York tonight.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.271
-Do you have her address?
-Come on in.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.795
-Can l get you something to drink?
-No, thanks.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.191
Hi, American Airlines,
reservations please.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.590
You sure? l got all my boys here.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.557
Jack, Johnnie and Jose.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.030
Maybe a poquito Jose.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.079
Are these actual baby back ribs?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.800
-Yeah, help yourself.
-Thanks.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.352
l'd like to make a reservation
on the redeye to New York tonight.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.830
Hey, do you mind if l turn on the TV?
l've got some money on the Lakers.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.070
-You bet sports?
-l'll bet anything.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.708
l had 200 bucks
on my sister's pregnancy test.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.753
How exactly do you know Mia?

19:58.920 --> 20:02.799
Oh, we used to do the ballet thing
together but l didn't have the discipline.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.949
-No kidding.
-l still dance, but just for tips.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.029
l'll call you back.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.074
You know, l'm thinking
she probably needs her space.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.389
Probably.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.638
-Mind if l hang out and watch the game?
-Be my guest.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.471
lf you got cash,
l could give you a lap dance at halftime.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.471
That'd be swell.
