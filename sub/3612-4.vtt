00:02.003 --> 00:03.459
Previously on Lost:

00:03.546 --> 00:07.164
We 're now beginning our final descent
into Los Ange/es International Airport.

00:07.258 --> 00:11.342
Mr. Shephard, there seems to have been
a mix-up involving the coffin.

00:11.429 --> 00:15.422
They lost my father. He died
in Australia a couple days ago.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.680
- Who are you?
- Jacob sent us.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.351
He said you would help our friend.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.229
Get him to the spring.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.110
What happened?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.484
He says you have to
give your friend this pill.

00:32.575 --> 00:35.362
- What is in it?
- Poison.

00:35.453 --> 00:40.698
- Why would you people wanna kill Sayid?
- There is a darkness growing in him.

00:40.791 --> 00:41.997
How can you be sure of that?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.122
Because it happened to your sister.

00:52.303 --> 00:53.463
Claire?

01:40.977 --> 01:42.592
Hey, Mom.

01:42.687 --> 01:46.179
- Have they found him yet?
- No, I called a couple hours ago,

01:46.274 --> 01:48.515
and they think the coffin
was checked through Berlin.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.895
- How do you lose a body?
- I don't know, Mom,

01:50.987 --> 01:53.729
there's nothing we can do
except for wait for more information.

01:53.823 --> 01:56.656
I don't want to wait.
How am I supposed to get anything done?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.324
I can't even find his will.
Papers everywhere.

01:59.412 --> 02:03.655
Look, Mom, I'll come over in a couple
hours, and we'll find it together. OK?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.616
- OK.
- Good.

02:06.711 --> 02:10.124
Now, Mom, when did I have
my appendix taken out?

02:10.214 --> 02:14.173
You were seven or eight, maybe.
You collapsed at school.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.546
Your father wanted to do
the procedure himself,

02:16.637 --> 02:19.504
but they wouldn't let him.
You don 't remember that?

02:19.598 --> 02:21.054
Yeah, I...

02:21.559 --> 02:23.220
I guess I do.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.846
- Damn it. Mom, I gotta go.
- Well, don 't forget to...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.421
Hey.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.997
Sorry I'm late.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.004
I thought I had enough time to
go home and change after work.

02:58.095 --> 03:01.929
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm sorry, David. OK?

03:02.016 --> 03:03.677
OK, Dad.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.946
I was afraid you'd left.

03:28.793 --> 03:33.036
- ls leaving an option?
- Everything is an option.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.916
But I would have to stop you.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.293
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.722
Your friends,
Ford and Austen and Kwon...

03:45.476 --> 03:47.933
...they're not coming back, are they?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.725
No, probably not.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.270
I appreciate your honesty.

04:07.498 --> 04:11.161
- Tie again, dude.
- Shocker. That's it for me.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.453
You hungry?

04:16.006 --> 04:18.918
- Are you?
- I could eat.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.752
Hey, man.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.673
Do you know if there's, like,
a kitchen in this place?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.217
It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.435
Dude, what are you doing here?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.068
I'm here because I need you.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.199
For what?

04:47.163 --> 04:49.950
You should get a pen.
You're gonna have to write things down.

04:52.168 --> 04:55.877
- What kind of things?
- Someone is coming to the island.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.085
I need you to help them find it.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.742
Hooked up the cable in here so
you can watch the Red Sox if you want.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.203
Thanks.

05:42.051 --> 05:45.418
- You reading this?
- Yeah.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.799
| used to read this to you
when you were little.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.757
You always wanted to hear
about Kitty and Snowdrop.

05:50.851 --> 05:56.062
They were Alice's... Hey. Hey!

05:57.566 --> 06:00.308
David. David.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.773
What are you listening to?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.325
You haven't heard of them.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.080
l'mjust trying to have
a conversation with you.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.452
Why?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.869
We see each other, like,
once a month. Can't we just...

06:23.050 --> 06:24.085
...get through it?

06:29.807 --> 06:30.922
Damn it.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.476
Yeah, Mom?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.725
Where are you?
I thought you were coming over.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.681
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm heading out now.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.732
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.735
l have to go over to your
grandmother's house. You wanna come?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.157
No, thanks.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.328
All right, well,
I'll be back in about an hour.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.828
- And then we'll eat, OK?
-Gmm.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.502
Let's just pile 'em up.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.019
Jack.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.472
Sayid.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.640
Why are they all staring at me?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.234
Just ignore them.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.779
Look, you told me these people
think l have an infection,

07:32.870 --> 07:35.282
that they wanted to give me
some mysterious pill

07:35.372 --> 07:38.284
that you instructed me not to take.
And then you disappeared.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.041
What are you hiding from me?

07:45.382 --> 07:49.375
The pill was poison.
They wanted me to kill you.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.213
Whatever it is they think
happened to you, Sayid...

07:55.893 --> 07:58.134
...they say it happened
to someone else, too.

08:00.773 --> 08:02.013
Who?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.658
Claire!

08:32.262 --> 08:33.593
I'm gonna get you out of there.

08:42.773 --> 08:47.142
- How long have you been out here?
- Since you all left.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.445
- How long ago was that?
- Three years.

08:54.326 --> 08:58.069
I gotta get you somewhere safe.
Come on. You think you can walk?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.824
I don't know.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.532
OK. OK.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.448
What are you doing?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.114
Nothin'.

09:40.873 --> 09:46.834
l'mjust, you know, looking,
'cause I'm a big fan of temples

09:46.920 --> 09:48.785
and, like, history...

09:50.591 --> 09:52.081
...and Indiana Jones stuff.

09:52.176 --> 09:55.714
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the courtyard.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.635
Tell him you can do what you want.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.137
Tell him you're a candidate.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.773
I'm a candidate,
and I can do what I want.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.480
Who told you that?

10:17.201 --> 10:18.361
Doesn't matter.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.156
Why don't you go back to the courtyard?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.883
- What'd he say?
- You don't want to know.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.632
- What are you doing?
- Going through the secret passageway

10:39.723 --> 10:41.839
- like you told me.
- I told you to bring Jack.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.801
You ever try to get Jack
to do something? It's impossible.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.477
- I can just go myself.
- You have to bring him with you.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.601
OK, it's bad enough you already made me
write down way too much stuff,

10:50.692 --> 10:55.026
and | just lied to a samurai.
If you have any idea how to get Jack

10:55.113 --> 10:57.729
to go on your little adventure,
I'm listening, dude.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.749
Be cool, man. Act natural.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.874
- What?
- Dude, keep your voice down.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.675
I'm gonna get up and go.
Wait ten seconds and then follow me.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.841
Follow you where?

11:25.936 --> 11:28.678
I found a secret tunnel
that leads out to the jungle.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.058
You found a secret tunnel.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.232
Well... Jacob told me about it.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.479
- He said you and me have to go...
- I'm not going anywhere.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.073
I told him you'd say that,
so he told me to tell you...

11:44.788 --> 11:46.779
"You have what it takes."

11:55.215 --> 11:57.456
- What did you just say?
- You have what it takes.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.542
He said you'd know what that meant.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.049
- Where is he?
- What?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.927
Jacob. Where is he?

12:07.311 --> 12:08.596
He's kind of dead.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.023
He turns up whenever he wants,
like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.308
But, if you wanna talk to him,
he's where we're going, dude.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.938
Well, then let's go see Jacob.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.671
Claire?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.580
Come on. Get in there!

13:26.723 --> 13:29.806
So, look what I found,
one of the men who tried to kill you.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.806
He was pretending to be dead, but
he wasn't. Now we get to talk to him.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.642
You wanna talk to me about what?

13:42.239 --> 13:44.025
About where you're hiding my son.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.167
We're gonna get that cleaned up.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.212
If there's one thing that'll kill you
around here, it's infection.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.793
- I'll be right back. Don't move, OK?
- Claire?

14:07.681 --> 14:10.514
Have you been out here
all this time... by yourself?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.591
Oh, no. I'm not by myself.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.521
Look, we've gotta get out of here now.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.322
- It's OK. I know her.
- No, I know her.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.530
You have any idea
what she's gonna do to us?

14:34.624 --> 14:38.242
If we don't get out of here now,
she's gonna kill us both.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.593
Which way?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.145
It's this way.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.693
Whoa, hey! It's me.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.780
- Jack! I almost shot you.
- I noticed.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.370
What are you doing out here?
Where's Jin and Sawyer?

15:19.461 --> 15:21.827
Jin went back to the Temple, and...

15:22.672 --> 15:24.173
...Sawyer's on his own.

15:26.510 --> 15:29.377
Kate, there's a secret door
to get back in the Temple,

15:29.471 --> 15:33.259
- on the north wall behind the big tree.
- I'm not going back to the Temple.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.840
I'm going to find Claire.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.300
- Kate...
- I'm going to the beach.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.057
- She might be there.
- Kate, she's not up at the beach.

15:43.193 --> 15:47.027
The people at the Temple said that
something... Something happened to her.

15:48.907 --> 15:52.115
- Do they know where she is?
- I don't know. They didn't say.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.871
- l have to find her.
- Kate, wait. Wait.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.950
Come with us, and then we'll
all go back to the Temple together.

16:01.044 --> 16:05.708
Dude, Jacob said just you and me.
She's kinda not invited.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.666
- I'm inviting her.
- Jack, it's OK.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.921
Just go. It's all right.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.886
I hope you find what you're looking for.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.997
- We're never going to find it.
- Take it easy, Mom.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.120
It's somewhere in here,
and we'll find it.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.793
It's like a needle in a damned haystack.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.214
Why your father wouldn't just give
his will to his lawyer is beyond me.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.088
Well... why would he
make it easy on us now?

16:56.558 --> 16:57.673
You want a drink?

16:59.269 --> 17:00.884
No. No, no thanks.

17:01.897 --> 17:02.886
Good for you.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.400
How's David holding up?

17:11.072 --> 17:13.779
- What?
- He was really upset at the funeral.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.992
- He was?
- He didn't tell you?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.695
No. No, he didn't.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.165
Communication is not
one of his strong suits.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.077
Well, it runs in the family.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.622
When you were David's age,
your father was lucky

17:30.717 --> 17:33.424
if he could get more than
one word out of you at a time.

17:33.511 --> 17:36.002
Well, that's because
I was terrified of him, Mom.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.263
How do you know David
isn't terrified of you?

17:43.188 --> 17:44.724
Why would he be?

17:45.732 --> 17:49.441
I don't know, Jack.
Maybe you should ask him.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.774
Foundit

17:59.037 --> 18:00.777
"Last will and testament."

18:14.886 --> 18:18.003
- Jack?
- Yeah?

18:19.391 --> 18:22.929
Did you father ever mention
a "Claire Littleton"?

18:51.047 --> 18:54.039
Hey. Untie me before she comes back in.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.041
Why would I do that?

18:56.761 --> 19:00.549
Are you not listening to me?
She's gonna kill us both.

19:01.933 --> 19:05.596
Loosen my ropes, and when she
comes back in, I'll snap her neck.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.429
So...

19:12.736 --> 19:16.228
I'm really sorry
you got stuck in my trap.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.440
Gonna get you all cleaned up now, OK?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.903
It's all right. You're doing good.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.698
Well, at least you don't
have to stitch yourself up.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.499
I had to do that once.
They shot me right here.

19:31.755 --> 19:36.374
- You've been living here since we left?
- Not always here.

19:36.468 --> 19:40.006
I had to move around
quite a lot to hide from them.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.721
Lucky I'm still alive.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.805
What are you gonna do with him?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.100
He's gonna tell me
where they've got my baby...

19:53.360 --> 19:56.523
- Where they've got Aaron.
- We don't have your kid.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.025
- You're lying! I know you have him.
- We never took...

19:59.115 --> 20:01.276
- Shut up.
- How do you know they took him?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.527
- How can you be so sure?
- How can I be so sure?

20:05.622 --> 20:09.456
OK, well, first my father told me,
and then my friend told me,

20:09.542 --> 20:13.330
- so I'm pretty damn sure.
- Your friend? Who is your friend?

20:14.756 --> 20:16.246
My friend.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.709
You're still my friend, aren't you?

20:23.848 --> 20:27.716
Yes. Yes, of course.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.179
Good. I'm glad.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.396
All done. Good as new.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.320
OK. So...

20:46.162 --> 20:47.868
Now it's your turn.

21:01.344 --> 21:05.428
- Sorry, dude.
- For what?

21:05.515 --> 21:09.258
You know, what happened back there,
wrecking your game with Kate.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.144
Don't worry about it.
There's nothing left to wreck.

21:13.231 --> 21:16.439
Yeah? Whatever happened to you guys?
I thought you were gonna get married

21:16.526 --> 21:20.485
- and have, like, a dozen kids.
- Guess I wasn't cut out for it.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.402
Really? I think you'd make a great dad.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.653
I'd make a terrible dad.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.281
What is that?

21:33.376 --> 21:36.914
- Asthma inhaler.
- Dude, it's Shannon's.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.214
We're at the caves.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.720
The caves we used to live in?

21:51.227 --> 21:53.434
I totally forgot
these were in here, man.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.897
Wait a sec.

22:03.865 --> 22:08.700
What if we time traveled again to,
like, dinosaur times,

22:09.913 --> 22:12.120
and then we died
and then we got buried here?

22:14.918 --> 22:17.000
What if these skeletons are us?

22:24.636 --> 22:25.876
What's that?

22:29.432 --> 22:31.218
I ever tell you howl found this place?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.597
- You were looking for water, right?
- No.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.731
l was chasing the ghost
of my dead father.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.445
He led me here.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.245
That was his coffin...

22:52.288 --> 22:54.495
...before I smashed it to pieces.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.085
Why'd you do that?

23:02.215 --> 23:04.126
Because he wasn't in it.

23:16.688 --> 23:20.146
David? I got us a pizza.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.476
Hey, dinner's...

23:46.718 --> 23:48.333
This is David. Leave a message.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.836
David, it's me again. Listen...

23:53.766 --> 23:58.351
lfl did something to upset you,
I am really, really sorry.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.313
I'm gonna drive over to your mother's
house. I know she's out of town.

24:02.400 --> 24:07.394
So if you are there, just...
Just don 't go anywhere, OK?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.815
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.340
David?

25:16.057 --> 25:18.719
Yes, this message is for David Shephard.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.268
Hi, David. This is Dr. Summer/and
from the Williams Conservatory.

25:22.355 --> 25:27.691
Just calling to confirm your slot
next Friday, the 24th, at 7:00 pm.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.689
We look fon/vard to seeing you,
and good luck.

25:34.826 --> 25:38.614
Hey, David. lt's Dad. I'm...

25:40.748 --> 25:43.364
I'm in Sydney, Australia. Something...

25:45.253 --> 25:46.834
Something happened, and l...

25:49.507 --> 25:51.293
I just needed to hear your voice.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.964
I guess I'll try you again later.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.756
I love you.

26:11.404 --> 26:15.647
This is cool, dude. Very old school.

26:15.742 --> 26:20.156
- What?
- You know, you and me...

26:21.164 --> 26:22.825
...trekking through the jungle...

26:23.416 --> 26:26.158
...on our way to do something
we don't quite understand.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.876
Good times.

26:30.506 --> 26:34.465
- You mind if I ask you somethin'?
- Sure.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.460
Why'd you come back?

26:38.347 --> 26:41.430
You know... to the island.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.555
Why'd you come back?

26:46.272 --> 26:50.140
Back in LA, Jacob hopped
into the back of my cab

26:50.234 --> 26:53.067
and told me l was
supposed to, so I came.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.022
What?

27:00.036 --> 27:03.278
If you have a better reason
for coming back, let's hear it, man.

27:10.755 --> 27:13.041
I came back here because I was broken.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.549
And I was stupid enough to think
this place could fix me.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.816
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- How much further we got, Hurley?

27:32.193 --> 27:35.151
It's not far. It's not far at all.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.614
It's right there.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.463
It's a lighthouse.

27:57.260 --> 28:00.252
I don't understand. How is it
that we've never seen it before?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.012
I guess we weren't looking for it.

28:11.315 --> 28:15.024
- So tell me where my son is.
- I don't know where your son is.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.853
Stop covering for them.
They're not gonna help you anymore.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.188
All you've gotta do
isjust tell me the truth.

28:20.283 --> 28:23.195
I am telling you the truth.
We don't have your kid.

28:23.286 --> 28:26.449
- We never had your kid!
- Stop lying to me!

28:26.539 --> 28:29.406
Your people took me
to the Temple and tortured me.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.037
No, we captured you because
you were out here in the jungle

28:34.297 --> 28:36.583
- Hold on.
- "Hold on"?

28:36.674 --> 28:40.166
Jin, they stuck me with needles!
They branded me!

28:44.056 --> 28:47.548
lfl hadn't been able to escape from
the Temple, they would've killed me.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.804
- You're not remembering right.
- Shut up, OK?!

28:49.896 --> 28:52.512
You've got one more chance.
One more chance.

28:52.607 --> 28:57.226
- Just tell me where my son is.
- I don't know where your damn kid is!

28:57.320 --> 28:59.060
Kate took him!

28:59.155 --> 29:03.148
Kate took Aaron. She took him with her
when she left the island.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.492
What do you mean she took him?

29:07.538 --> 29:11.781
He's been with her,
with Kate, for the past three years.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.871
Aaron is three.

29:17.298 --> 29:21.382
He's telling you the truth.
We had nothing to do with this.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.503
So if you just untie me,

29:25.598 --> 29:31.093
I'll leave, and I promise I will
never tell anyone I ever even saw you.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.020
Just untie me.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.147
Pretty cool, huh?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.601
- Jacob's in here?
- I guess so.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.983
But we gotta go upstairs
and turn this thing on.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.329
Doesn't say anything on your arm
about the door being jammed?

30:35.084 --> 30:36.574
No.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.038
After you.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.293
- Thank you.
- Is that your son?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.165
- Yes.
- He's really good.

32:27.363 --> 32:30.571
They are too young to have
this kind of pressure, aren't they?

32:33.869 --> 32:36.326
Yes. Yes, they are.

32:36.413 --> 32:39.371
It's hard to watch
and be unable to help.

32:40.501 --> 32:42.742
Your son has a gift.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.211
How long has he been playing?

32:47.341 --> 32:50.378
l... I don't know.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.192
Dude, this is cool.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.619
Must've built this
to help ships get here and stuff.

33:21.792 --> 33:26.081
I guess they used a mirror 'cause...
electricity hadn't been invented yet.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.463
- Where's Jacob?
- He's not here yet.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.545
Let's get started.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.017
Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.011
Stop.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.927
- Did you see that?
- Did I see what?

34:21.852 --> 34:23.934
The mirror.
I saw something in the mirror.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.477
It's just the ocean.

34:37.660 --> 34:38.900
These are our names.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.456
Turn it to 23 degrees.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.328
I don't think Jacob wants...

35:08.524 --> 35:10.515
What? What is that?

35:13.028 --> 35:14.689
It's my house.

35:16.198 --> 35:18.109
It's the house I grew up in.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.488
That's weird.

35:22.579 --> 35:25.537
I haven't lived in that house
since I was a kid.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.288
He's been watching us.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.046
The whole time, all of us.
He's been watching us.

35:37.845 --> 35:40.336
Hurley. Where's Jacob?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.635
- I don't know.
- You said that he would be here.

35:44.727 --> 35:49.221
- Well, lwasjust... kind of assuming.
- Hurley...

35:50.607 --> 35:52.643
I wanna know why he was watching me.

35:52.735 --> 35:56.227
I wanna know,
so you're gonna ask him right now.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.028
It doesn't work like that, I told you.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.731
He just kinda shows up
whenever he feels like it.

36:06.749 --> 36:08.239
What are you doing?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.543
- Why was he watching me?
- I don't know.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.336
Why is my name written on this thing?

36:15.424 --> 36:17.039
- He didn't tell me.
- What does he want?

36:17.134 --> 36:19.591
- l was supposed to... I don't know!
- What does he want?!

36:20.846 --> 36:21.881
Don't!

36:55.839 --> 36:57.045
You were great in there.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.638
You saw me?

37:08.936 --> 37:10.767
I missed a couple of notes.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.186
It sounded perfect
from where l was standing.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.393
David, you scared the hell out of me.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.363
You were at Grandma's.

37:24.535 --> 37:27.743
I thought I could get back
to your place before you got home.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.947
I didn't even know
you were still playing.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.662
I made Mom promise not to tell you.

37:35.379 --> 37:36.994
Why?

37:38.757 --> 37:43.547
It was always such a big deal to you.
You used to sit and watch me practice.

37:43.637 --> 37:47.676
You were so... into it.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.933
I didn't tell you
l was coming here because...

37:56.024 --> 37:58.185
...I didn't want you to see me fall.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.908
You know, when l was your age,

38:11.999 --> 38:14.490
my father didn't
want to see me fall either.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.367
He used to say to me that...

38:19.548 --> 38:21.789
He said that
I didn't have what it takes.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.052
I spent my whole life
carrying that around with me.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.599
And I don't ever
want you to feel that way.

38:34.104 --> 38:38.973
I will always love you,
no matter what you do.

38:39.067 --> 38:42.195
In my eyes, you can never fail.

38:44.907 --> 38:47.239
| just wanna be a part of your life.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.583
OK.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.747
I've got some pizza
back at the house. You hungry?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.751
- Sure.
- Good.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.138
Let's go home.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.161
How'd it go?

39:40.170 --> 39:41.205
Where were you, man?

39:42.172 --> 39:44.208
Doesn't matter.
He wouldn't have been able to see me.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.462
Yeah, well, if you'd told me that
and had explained everything,

39:47.553 --> 39:51.421
then Jack wouldn't have freaked out
and smashed your mirror into pieces.

39:51.515 --> 39:53.631
Thanks for the seven years
of bad luck, by the way.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.640
You got ink on your forehead.

39:57.521 --> 40:00.183
l have ink on my forehead?
That's all you have to say?!

40:00.274 --> 40:03.687
Jack broke your lighthouse, dude!
Mission unaccomplished.

40:03.777 --> 40:06.940
Whoever you said we needed to help
get to the island is totally screwed.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.895
I'm sure they'll find some other way.

40:11.285 --> 40:15.449
So... everything you
wanted me to do didn't get done...

40:16.164 --> 40:18.621
...and... you don't even care?

40:24.673 --> 40:25.662
Wait a minute.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.833
Did you want Jack to see
what was in that mirror?

40:33.056 --> 40:34.045
Why?

40:35.475 --> 40:38.433
It was the only way for him
to understand how important he is.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.762
Well, if that was your plan,
I think it backfired, man.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.223
Jack is here because
he has to do something.

40:44.318 --> 40:47.526
He can't be told what that is.
He's gotta find it himself.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.939
Sometimes you can just
hop in the back of someone's cab

40:52.034 --> 40:54.275
and tell 'em what
they're supposed to do.

40:55.329 --> 41:00.164
Other times, you have to let him
look out at the ocean for a while.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.295
Well, next time, how about
you tell me everything up front?

41:06.381 --> 41:11.296
- I'm not big on secret plans, OK?
- I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo.

41:11.386 --> 41:14.753
I had to get you and Jack as far away
from that Temple as I possibly could.

41:14.848 --> 41:18.215
- What? Why?
- 'Cause someone's coming there.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.978
- Someone bad.
- Dude, we gotta warn them.

41:23.065 --> 41:27.650
You can't warn them, Hugo.
I'm sorry. It's too late.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.084
Look, if! didn't kill him,
he would've killed me.

41:45.796 --> 41:48.128
I'm glad you didn't untie him.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.047
Claire, please,
whatever you're thinking...

41:51.134 --> 41:53.216
Why'd you say that Kate
was raising Aaron?

41:59.059 --> 42:00.924
l was lying.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.681
Why?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.643
Because I wanted to save his life.

42:10.987 --> 42:14.730
But you were right.
The Others have your baby.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.656
Aaron is at the Temple.
I know because I saw him there.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.618
But you'll need me to get to him.

42:31.508 --> 42:32.714
How do we get in?

42:35.637 --> 42:38.049
There's a secret way.
No one will see us.

42:39.933 --> 42:42.299
Thank you, Jin. Thank you.

42:45.147 --> 42:47.559
And I'm so glad to know you were lying.

42:47.649 --> 42:51.688
Because, if what you said was the truth,
if Kate was raising Aaron?

42:53.989 --> 42:55.479
I'd kill her.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.315
Am I interrupting?

43:07.169 --> 43:08.625
John?

43:10.213 --> 43:13.501
That's not John. This is my friend.
