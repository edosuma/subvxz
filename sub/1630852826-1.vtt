00:26.234 --> 00:31.156
My physical insecurities
have definitely affected my dating life.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.492
This experiment allows me to be judged

00:34.576 --> 00:37.370
for who I am
as a person versus the physical.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.136
My dating experience has sucked.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.556
I'm here because I'm looking for the one,

00:56.639 --> 01:00.894
the one who loves me for my personality,
and not what I look like.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.062
And I hope I find him.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.243
I'm getting to know
someone's heart before anything else.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.838
I'm ready for marriage,
but I've never felt true love in my life.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.675
I don't think I ever said to anyone,
"I love you," except my mom.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.955
It's so cute in here.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.457
Hi!

02:04.541 --> 02:06.251
-Hey!

02:07.418 --> 02:09.170
-Hey. What's up, guys?
-Not much.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.338
-Wow.
-Have a seat.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.090
Oh man, it's happening now.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.634
-It's gettin' real now, isn't it?
-Oh yeah.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.266
Welcome. I'm Vanessa Lachey.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.644
-I'm Nick Lachey. Obviously.
-Obviously.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.564
Ladies, welcome to <i>Love Is Blind.</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:32.861
-Guys, welcome to <i>Love Is Blind.</i>

02:32.944 --> 02:33.987
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

02:37.866 --> 02:41.452
Do you feel like the dating world nowadays
has become extremely superficial?

02:41.536 --> 02:42.453
-Yes.
-Yes.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.371
Yeah.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.873
It's all just looks.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.249
-No depth.
-Yes.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.168
When I meet men on dating apps,

02:48.251 --> 02:50.211
I think they see Asian and stereotype me,

02:50.295 --> 02:53.631
thinking I'm gonna be quiet,
more submissive.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.634
And then they'll meet me,
I'm a bit louder, more outgoing.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.180
-Yes, girl.
-And more career-oriented and opinionated.

03:00.263 --> 03:04.225
I always hear at the end of the date,
"I wasn't expecting you to be like that."

03:04.309 --> 03:05.143
Interesting.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.896
I feel it's more of a look,
first impression.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.481
"Blonde hair,
big boobs, she's a great time."

03:10.565 --> 03:13.860
"It's not wifey material."
And they don't give me that chance.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.946
The chance to open up,
and be myself, and be vulnerable.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.033
I feel I have so much to give,
but I can't get to that point.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.785
-Yeah.
-We wanna be loved for who we are.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.914
And the gentlemen here
are here for the exact same reason.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.167
This experiment is
a proven approach to finding love.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.920
So over the next ten days,

03:32.003 --> 03:35.715
you guys are gonna finally have
the chance to fall in love,

03:35.798 --> 03:38.218
based solely on who you are on the inside.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.135
That's good.

03:39.219 --> 03:43.723
Not because of your looks, your race,
your background, or your income.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.060
You guys,
there'll be no devices, zero distractions.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.604
The only time you guys are gonna interact

03:49.687 --> 03:51.189
are in the private pods.

03:54.275 --> 03:58.196
You're gonna be separated
by one thin wall.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.323
You won't ever get to see each other.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407
We know.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.036
All decisions are yours.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.830
You alone will choose
who you wanna spend time with.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.376
When you pick the person you wanna spend
the rest of your life with, propose.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.586
-Wow.
-Oh yeah.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.463
And if they accept,

04:15.546 --> 04:19.217
you will <i>see</i> your fiancée
for the very first time.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.760
Wow.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.012
And four weeks later,
you are at your wedding.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.849
You have to make
the most important decision of your life.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.853
This is where it gets exciting.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.731
Will you say, "I do" to the person
you fall in love with here…

04:33.815 --> 04:34.857
Sight unseen?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.777
…or will the real world
sabotage that love,

04:37.860 --> 04:40.530
and will you walk away
from that person forever?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.409
Is love truly blind?

04:44.492 --> 04:45.326
My God…

04:46.369 --> 04:48.663
If you are ready
to find the love of your life…

04:48.746 --> 04:49.580
Yes.

04:50.290 --> 04:55.461
…walk through those doors,
because the pods are officially open.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.255
-Open!
-Here we go!

04:57.797 --> 05:01.050
-Good luck, guys.
-Go get 'em, girls! Get you your husband!

05:03.011 --> 05:05.138
-Are you ready?
-I'm really ready.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.056
I've spent a long time waiting.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.517
-You ready?
-Oh God.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.020
I'm very excited
about getting in the pods

05:12.103 --> 05:14.230
because I've never made it
past the first date

05:14.314 --> 05:18.359
without a girl bringing up my gray hair.
Developed a little complex.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.488
Right here, inside of these pods.
Find the love of our lives, man.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.621
Doesn't matter what I look like,
how much I weigh, color, ethnicity,

05:30.705 --> 05:34.125
anything you come from,
it is who you are inside,

05:34.208 --> 05:35.626
and I'm looking forward

05:35.710 --> 05:39.505
to what potentially
could be discovered in these pods,

05:39.589 --> 05:42.467
because I do indeed
wanna leave here with a husband.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.346
-What's the first question gonna be?
-I still don't know.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.222
-Just gonna go right in?
-Yeah.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.432
Let's do this.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.975
Let's get it!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
-Hello.
-Hello.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.189
Hi.
-Hola.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.523
Howdy Doody.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.525
-Let's just get the party started.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.738
-Have you ever been in love?
-How about a name? Then we can ask.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.948
Oh my God.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.869
I'm putting my hand on the wall.
Can you see me?

06:09.952 --> 06:10.787
No, I can't.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.914
-Are you as nervous as I am?
-Oh my God.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.166
-Hello?
-Welcome to my pod.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.586
This experiment
interests me because,

06:18.669 --> 06:21.464
you know, I don't have boobs and a butt,
so it's like,

06:21.547 --> 06:23.633
if I'm not, like, really dressed up,

06:23.716 --> 06:25.843
sometimes I look like a 13-year-old boy.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.766
I wanna find my life partner.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.560
I've always envisioned it
like my best friend.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.771
This'd be an awesome story
to tell our kids.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.690
"I met your dad in a social experiment,

06:39.774 --> 06:42.360
where I was dating 14 other guys."

06:42.443 --> 06:44.320
Like, "I'm sorry, what, Mom?"

06:47.865 --> 06:49.992
-Hello, hello.
-Hi.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.745
-What's going on? What's your name?
-Iyanna.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.873
-What's your name?
-Iyanna, this is Jarrette.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.919
-Where you from?
-From Atlanta. And where you from?

07:00.002 --> 07:01.421
Anchorage, Alaska.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.382
-It's where I currently reside.
-You ain't gonna play with me.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.342
-Where you from?
-I'm from Chicago.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.555
-He plays too much.
-I got all the jokes.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.101
So, what you do for a living?

07:15.184 --> 07:17.311
I'm a program coordinator
at a surrogacy agency.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.772
-Okay. Do you want children?
-Of course.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.359
-Ooh. I want two of them little things.
-I want at least two.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.279
I wouldn't mind four,
depending on what our finances look like…

07:26.362 --> 07:28.281
-Say what?
-…and what our time look like--

07:28.364 --> 07:29.991
Wait, wait. Hello. You said what?

07:30.992 --> 07:33.202
-Did you say four?
-Is that too ambitious for you?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.955
My God, what you want,
a half of a starting lineup?

07:38.207 --> 07:41.627
I've always wanted a big family,
'cause I didn't have one growing up.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.381
I was an only child,
and it was kind of lonely.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.841
Are you and your mom close?

07:48.217 --> 07:49.343
Um…

07:50.219 --> 07:53.347
No. So, my biological mom
raised me until I was nine,

07:53.431 --> 07:54.348
um…

07:54.432 --> 07:57.602
And she's not in the healthiest space
to be able to raise me.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.062
So, she kind of gave me
to her first cousin

08:00.146 --> 08:03.441
and she raised me until I was 18,
and then I got kicked out of the house,

08:03.524 --> 08:07.528
and then I moved in with my godparents
who adopted me at 22, and yeah.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.701
-You had a lot going on as a child.
-Yeah, I did.

08:14.410 --> 08:18.623
I had so many odds against me.
I should not be this okay, you know?

08:25.630 --> 08:29.592
-All right, come here. I wanna hug you.
-No, no, no. I'm okay.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.595
Shit. No, I'm hugging the wall.

08:34.722 --> 08:39.143
I'm here to find my wife.
Someone who's a good person at their core.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.898
-Nice meeting you. We'll talk again.
-We definitely will.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.360
So, last year,
I had a pretty traumatic incident.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.321
I spent about a week
being in the ICU by myself.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.118
I just felt so helpless.
I was brought to my knees

08:56.202 --> 09:00.248
because I didn't have the woman there
who was able to kind of be by my side

09:00.331 --> 09:02.500
and be there in the trenches with me.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.629
I came to this experiment because
the one thing that matters to me above all

09:06.712 --> 09:09.674
is just having real, pure love.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.678
I want someone who's gonna be
by my side through thick and thin.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.720
That's why I'm here.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.305
Ow!

09:16.389 --> 09:18.057
-Hello.
-How are you?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.768
-I'm good. How are you?
-I'm good. What is your name?

09:20.851 --> 09:24.272
-My name's Mallory. What's your name?
-Nice to meet you, Mallory.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.606
My name is Jarrette.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.818
-Jarrette. Nice to meet you.
-Not like the Subway guy.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.320
-No. Thank God, no.
-Or the jeweler.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.780
What do you like to do for fun?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.866
I'm in a football league,
softball league, and basketball league.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.745
-What about you?
-Um, I love running, I love dancing.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.165
Sundays, I love… Me and my friends
go watch Bears games.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.585
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.837
I grew up with two brothers, so I'm…

09:47.920 --> 09:51.632
I'm a big sports person
through and through.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.968
It's hard to find
a woman who's into sports.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.885
Oh.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.014
-I'm loving it for sure.
-Great. That's awesome. Thank you, Jer.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.891
-Does anyone call you JerBear?
-Nobody calls me JerBear.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.352
-I'ma start calling you JerBear.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.692
I think in this day and age,
you don't sit with your feelings.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.112
You don't take the time
to really think about marriage

10:13.195 --> 10:16.282
or having kids or values and goals.

10:17.658 --> 10:21.329
People nowadays,
they avoid those conversations

10:21.412 --> 10:22.288
like the plague.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.625
Hey.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.127
Hello. My name is Salvador.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.546
Salvador. Nice to meet you.
My name's Mallory.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.214
-Mallory.
-Yeah.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.215
All right.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.177
Tell me about yourself.
Where you from?

10:36.260 --> 10:39.597
I'm from a big Hispanic bubble.
El Paso, Texas.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.806
Oh, nice. Okay.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.852
Coming from a Latino background,
I feel like I get a little judgment

10:44.935 --> 10:48.147
with, like, machismo,
and I'm not that person at all.

10:48.230 --> 10:52.860
I believe in the importance
of vulnerability. I like crying.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.488
I feel like emotions
and tears are strength.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.574
So, this process
just really grabs my attention,

10:58.658 --> 11:01.577
because in the real world,
I haven't found someone

11:01.661 --> 11:04.080
that appreciates my love
as much as I appreciate theirs.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.206
That's why I'm here.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.877
Something that surprises people

11:09.960 --> 11:12.171
is that I studied opera
all throughout college.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.888
Where was your family from?

11:20.971 --> 11:23.933
I was born and raised in Chicago.
I'm from the South Side.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.060
My dad's Mexican, my mom's Polish.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.770
-My parents are Mexican.
-Nice.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.064
-Do you speak Spanish?
-A little.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.233
-Oh damn!

11:32.316 --> 11:34.902
-Stop.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.821
-Two cultures, huh?
-Yeah.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.866
I mean, I have a pretty big, loud family.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.952
I'm the youngest of four.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.704
Big, loud family.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.748
I'm sure weddings are fun
with your family and whatnot.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.127
It's important, and I feel like
they're your default best friends.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.586
Oh, for sure.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.214
I love them all. I'm on the same page.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.467
-Family is really big for me.
-Okay. How many siblings do you have?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.553
-Well, I have two sisters.
-Nice.

12:00.636 --> 12:01.929
And then my older brother.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.099
I'm the middle child,
the peacemaker of all them.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.643
I thought the middle child
was the trouble child.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.565
No, I'm super laid back.
I'm soft on the inside.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.693
-I'm like a Ferrero Rocher.
-Oh, that's so sweet.

12:16.694 --> 12:17.987
But I like it.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.243
-Hopefully, I get to talk to you again.
-I hope so too.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.041
Oh my God.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.878
Obviously, I can't see him,
I don't know what he looks like,

12:33.961 --> 12:36.797
all I have to go off of,
at least initially, is a voice

12:36.881 --> 12:40.426
and Sal just has
a really, really nice, sultry voice.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.844
Oh God.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.890
What's a Sunday Funday to you?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.684
I like being active, a bottomless brunch.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.395
-Same here.
-Just wait 'til you meet Wine Danielle.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.108
-I actually really enjoy your voice.
-Really?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.193
Yeah, of course.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.986
And I was, like, so scared.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.573
What if I come here and everyone's like,
"That girl has an unattractive voice."

13:02.656 --> 13:04.867
-And that's all I have right now.

13:04.950 --> 13:05.951
What do you do?

13:06.035 --> 13:07.620
I love to punch drywall.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.622
Oh God.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.956


13:11.040 --> 13:12.374
I have a dirt bike too,

13:12.458 --> 13:13.626
just to top it off.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.668
Oh God.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.587
I wish I looked like J. Lo.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.548
-Hello?
-There's no place like home.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.925


13:21.008 --> 13:23.427
Oh my God.
I gotta pick my wedgie again.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.555
-Uh, I work in real estate.
-Do you sell a lot?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.057
'Cause I feel like you have to be

13:28.140 --> 13:31.060
somewhat attractive
to sell a lot.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.229
There's a lot of shallow people
in this world.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.022
Is that a normal question to ask?

13:35.105 --> 13:38.484
You have to ask
all the questions up front, okay?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.569
Right. That's not what this is about.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.489
I have a huge Instagram following.

13:44.573 --> 13:47.409
Obviously, I have, like, a lot of friends.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.289
Like, it's crazy. I think I'm really good
at these pods because, like, with my job,

13:52.373 --> 13:56.919
I have, like, five to, like, 20 people
in my car, like, at a time.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.462
-Okay.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.505
Are you Latina?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.465
-I am.
-You are?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.550
I'm half.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.927
-Latina vibes over there.
-Oh my God.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.930
I love buying clothes for girls.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.932
What's your size?

14:10.015 --> 14:12.101
What the fuck?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.311
Well, do you like working out?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.521
Yeah, not a huge fan.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.273
-Really? Ooh.
-Yep.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.568
I get along best
with individuals that do work out.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.236
How old are you?

14:22.319 --> 14:24.864
-Thirty-three.
-I prefer dating younger.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.366
-How old are you?
-I'm 32.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.663
-What's your name?
-My name is Deepti.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.624
-So, you're Indian.
-Yes. Oh shit! How did you know?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.334
I'm Indian.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.214
I was born in India,
and then I moved here when I was eight.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.758
My serious relationships,

14:44.842 --> 14:46.886
they've all been… blonde.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.804
Oh, really? Okay.

14:48.888 --> 14:54.018
I just remember moving to America,
seeing two things for the first time.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.813
-Seeing snow and blonde girls.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.982
And I felt the same way when I saw both.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.568
I was like, "Oh wow."
You like what you like. Right?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.652
I mean, you know?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.196
Figured I should just
get that out there right away.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.073
-Yeah.
-You could just…

15:08.157 --> 15:10.159
-Do what you want with that info?
-Exactly.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.870
-What's your name?
-Abhishek. I go by Shake.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.415
-You've never dated an Indian girl?
-Honestly, no.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.876
That's funny. I also go for the blonds.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.044
Really?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.880
I've actually only dated
white guys before.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.050
We're both brown people
that only date white people.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.136
-So, what do you do?
-I'm a veterinarian, actually.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.931
-I love that.
-I'm also a house DJ.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.265
Oh my gosh. I love music.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.435
If we were to be
at a music festival,

15:36.518 --> 15:39.063
do you like being on a guy's shoulders?

15:39.146 --> 15:41.774
Yeah, you're up for the challenge?
You can pick me up?

15:41.857 --> 15:45.027
Yeah. But, um, will I have trouble
picking you up?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.825
Actually,
that comes off very superficial.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.369
Um…

15:53.953 --> 15:56.872
Shake doesn't understand
how<i> Love Is Blind </i>has to work.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.417
The whole point is
about finding out who we are as people,

16:00.501 --> 16:02.252
not, "Can you carry me?"

16:02.336 --> 16:04.838
I mean, right? Like…

16:07.341 --> 16:11.178
The conversation was so good,
I didn't realize where we are.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.347
-You lost track of time.
-Literally.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.849
-How was it? Good?
-It was good. Yeah.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.144
Hi, ladies.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.230
-Hi.
-Hey.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.690
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.149
How did it go?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.568
Oh my God, it went so well.
I don't want to stop.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.115
We all came here saying
we feel like we're ready for marriage.

16:31.198 --> 16:35.160
There are conversations
that I was having in seven minutes

16:35.244 --> 16:38.247
where I felt like
I learned more about that person

16:38.330 --> 16:43.168
than some people
who I maybe dated for two months.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.587
Which is kind of crazy to think about.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.465
I met with the funniest guy.
I didn't even get his name.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.675
He's just a mystery.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.137
Mystery man's probably not the one
if you can't remember anything about it.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.515
You literally made
an Excel spreadsheet on your notebook.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.476
The algorithm. Danielle and I have
the same idea of brunch,

16:59.560 --> 17:01.562
and that's something
I'm really looking for.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.397
I feel like there are gonna be

17:03.480 --> 17:06.233
a lot of people that have tops
that are gonna be similar.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.820
Yeah. I mean, you can tell
which ones are outstanding, yeah.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.280
Day one was a lot.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.949
Immediately, I knew
me and Shayne wouldn't be a good fit.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.576
I liked her too.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.287
I would be so annoyed
by the end of a date.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.913
Oh, and then Shake.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.958
Shake was another one I was like,
"Okay, that's not gonna work."

17:23.042 --> 17:26.336
I'm really feeling Nick.
I'm feeling Jarrette quite a bit.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.422
Jarrette had a really nice voice.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.967
Kyle, but he's a little mischievous thing.
So I was like, "I don't know."

17:32.051 --> 17:33.260
Mmm, he's a troublemaker.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.888
I have people that
I definitely didn't vibe with.

17:35.971 --> 17:40.476
I have people I definitely vibed with,
and then I have ten in the middle,

17:40.559 --> 17:42.102
that I have no idea.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.656


17:54.740 --> 17:56.450
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Of course.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.744
I actually do
really want this bagel.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.497
There's three blueberries.
Eat 'em sparingly.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.668
I burnt myself
with a straightener on my forehead.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.963
So, I'm trying to cover it,
but it's not covering.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.633
Guess they don't even see us anyway.
So, what's the point?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.009
It's day two.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.512
I've been on a lot of online dates.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.264
I have met really weird--

18:19.348 --> 18:20.891
Oh, that's so rude to say.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.186
One time, I went on a date
with a guy who wore jean shorts.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.814
He doesn't have my style of dress, and…

18:26.897 --> 18:29.399
and I just assumed
that it wouldn't go well

18:29.483 --> 18:31.735
because we didn't have
dress styles in common,

18:31.819 --> 18:34.655
which is a silly thing to say,
and it's so stupid.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.740
It's not gonna help me
find the love of my life.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.034
Who cares what
the love of my life wears, right?

18:39.118 --> 18:42.746
At the end of the day, it matters
how his personality fits with mine.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.415
But jean shorts…

18:47.751 --> 18:49.044
Hey, wait up.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.046
Wait for me!

18:51.130 --> 18:54.675
I think the big pivotal moment for me
where I really thought,

18:54.758 --> 18:57.010
"I want to find my one,
I want to be married"

18:57.094 --> 19:02.558
is watching my grandfather take care
of my grandmother with Alzheimer's.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.601
She can't move, she can't talk.

19:04.685 --> 19:09.356
When I saw just the unconditional love
and support he gives her,

19:09.439 --> 19:13.694
I remember thinking, like, "I want that."
I want someone who will love me

19:13.777 --> 19:18.282
regardless of the condition I am in
or my weaknesses and flaws.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.368
I don't want to be at age 80 and be alone

19:21.451 --> 19:23.954
and not have experienced
that type of love.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.542
-Hello.
-Hello. This is Shayne.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.836
-Hi. How are you?
-I'm good. How are you doing?

19:30.919 --> 19:31.753
I'm good.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.672
-Who am I speaking to?
-Natalie.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.340
Oh, Natalie.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.425
Yeah, it's me.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.428
-What a pleasant surprise.
-I'm so excited I'm talking to you.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.432
I remember-- I wrote this down
in my notes yesterday, but I was like,

19:43.515 --> 19:45.225
I think I put a star by your name

19:45.309 --> 19:47.561
because I wanted to continue
our conversation.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.938
-Ooh! Look at that!
-Yeah.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.775
The vibe I had for you is, like,
it was so easy to talk to you,

19:53.859 --> 19:58.071
and it was, like, so smooth and so fluid,
and I just liked your energy.

19:58.155 --> 20:02.409
I just… I feed off of energy
and I feed off of, you know, just, like,

20:02.492 --> 20:05.454
I can tell from the tone
of people's voices if they're interested,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.331
or, you know, it's their personality.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.874
Hey, I'm all about it.

20:08.957 --> 20:13.212
So, tell me about your jobs.
You said you're a consultant, right?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.130
-Yeah. So, I'm in consulting.
-Yeah.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.716
Not to toot my own horn,
but I feel like I'm good at it,

20:17.799 --> 20:19.176
so it's a fit, skill-wise.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.471
Can I be honest with you? Please toot
your own horn much as possible.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.556
Honestly, that is
the most attractive thing.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.769
Like, there's a difference between,
like, being cocky and arrogance,

20:28.852 --> 20:31.480
but, like… you should be proud
of what you've done,

20:31.563 --> 20:33.482
and you should be confident
in who you are.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.193
That's so sexy to me. I'm--

20:38.695 --> 20:41.281
I know you said
you have your own real estate business.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.744
So I'm sure you do it a lot more,
but, for work events or networking events.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.498
I mean, I think it's important
that I have a husband

20:49.581 --> 20:51.208
that can hold his own.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.376
Is that weird to say?

20:52.459 --> 20:55.921
I think about, at the end of this,
we could have fiancés.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.548
-Yeah.
-So it's not even like, "My boyfriend."

20:58.632 --> 21:00.384
It's like, "Oh my gosh. My fiancé."

21:00.467 --> 21:03.762
We won't be boyfriend and girlfriend.
We're going straight to engagement.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.347
-You're my fiancée. Like…
-Yeah.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.017
I mean, like, the fact
I can marry you or someone else--

21:09.101 --> 21:12.854
Hold on. Time out. Not someone else.
Let's just focus on this guy right here.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.234
-You are my number one. So…
-Really? You are my number one too.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.694
Ooh. Look at that.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.363
Oh my God.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.247


21:31.873 --> 21:33.458
What do you like about Natalie?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.003
That she liked me.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.629
That'll help.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.299
I'm a words guy, dude. I was her favorite.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.009
-And now…
-And that's…

21:42.092 --> 21:46.805
Dude, you give me the words of that, man,
I, like, my ego goes through the roof.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.640
-Like, boom.
-I feel ya.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.436
I love the energy I get from people.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.689
I just can't sit behind a desk all day
and just look at an Excel sheet.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.983
Some of these guys
are very good at that, but me,

21:58.066 --> 22:00.694
I need to be in front of people,
feed off of their energy.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.987
I feel fantastic.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.740
I didn't think my confidence
could go higher, but it did.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.576
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

22:07.659 --> 22:10.078
In the dating world,
the past couple of years is just…

22:10.162 --> 22:12.414
Their idea of flirting is poking fun.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.499
Girl goes, "You're Shayne, aren't you?"

22:14.583 --> 22:16.501
Instantly knew when I walked in that door.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.794
No one has your voice.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.546
You sound like Beetlejuice.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.090
You called me fucking Beetlejuice.
That's a fuckin'--

22:22.174 --> 22:24.051
-That's a tough one to swallow.
-You can take it.

22:24.134 --> 22:27.929
I think I'm a huge tool, 100%.
I own that. That's fine. I get it.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.973
At the same time,
I have a really kind heart

22:30.057 --> 22:33.310
and I really am passionate
about just life and who I am.

22:33.393 --> 22:37.647
And I feel like there's a lot more to me
that, you know, meets the eye.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.150
I hope all the girls can see that too.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.570
Hello. Who am I speaking to?

22:43.653 --> 22:45.614
-This Shayne?
-Is this Shayne?

22:45.697 --> 22:47.407
-Uh-huh. Yes.
-Is this Shayne?

22:47.491 --> 22:48.825
How do you know that?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.203
-Hello?
-Hello.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.287
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.663
Who am I speaking to?

22:53.747 --> 22:55.916
-This is Shaina.
-Hi, Shaina.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.376
-Is this Shayne?
-Yes.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.169
-Hi, Shayne.
-Is that obvious?

22:59.252 --> 23:01.505
-Yeah.
-Why is that obvious?

23:01.588 --> 23:02.506
Your voice.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.800
That's what everyone keeps telling me.

23:04.883 --> 23:09.888
The only voice I can really diffy-entiate,
or whatever the word is, was your voice.

23:09.971 --> 23:14.434
Honestly, it's fantastic that I walked in
and you already knew who I was.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.312
I think physical attraction
is definitely important,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.815
but when you emotionally connect
with that person,

23:19.898 --> 23:22.859
they're automatically attractive.
I don't care what anybody says.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.362
You could be a seven or even a five.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.448
If I find them so funny
and emotionally attractive

23:28.532 --> 23:32.077
and they have such a good heart,
they become more physically attractive.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.453
So they wouldn't be a five.

23:34.788 --> 23:38.166
Like, dude, actually,
the average height is 5' 7" for a man.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.794
Do you know that?
And honestly, I don't want a ten, okay?

23:40.877 --> 23:43.547
You don't want all the other women
after your man. Okay?

23:43.630 --> 23:44.756
Ask any woman.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.883
As we get older, we get wiser.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.429
-Okay, question.
-What's up?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.807
-What do you want in a wife?
-I want self-awareness.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.810
-Someone very secure of who they are.
-Definitely.

23:56.893 --> 24:00.147
I'm very, very good at reassuring
how I feel about someone.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.149
We all have our insecurities,

24:02.232 --> 24:07.112
but tell me I'm fabulous once in a while,
I can walk off feeling happy with my day.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.948
You'll never have
a problem with me doing that.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.367
-Fantastic.
-I'm the biggest hype man. It's genuine.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.953
Yeah. Even if it's funny sometimes too.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.372
Like, "Oh babe, your ass looks good
in those jeans!"

24:17.456 --> 24:19.416
That'll surprise me
and stuff like that too…

24:19.499 --> 24:21.835
-I think it's important.
-It's very-- People do not--

24:21.918 --> 24:24.337
I feel like compliments
are so rare these days.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.132
-I'm huge into it.
-Especially with people you care about.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.592
They just expect, like…

24:28.675 --> 24:32.762
People, because of my personality,
they assume I get compliments 24/7,

24:32.846 --> 24:35.307
and it couldn't be farther
from the opposite.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.685
-Isn't that insane? I agree with you.
-It is. No, but I believe it too.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.271
-People don't give compliments anymore.
-No, they don't.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.066
If I came up to you,
out of the blue, and said something like,

24:45.150 --> 24:48.361
"I love your eyes--
the color of your eyes--"

24:48.445 --> 24:50.030
Shayne, you'll melt my heart.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.908
But it would come off creepy,
for some people.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.702
-Not to me. I don't.
-Lots of girls find it creepy.

24:55.785 --> 24:59.331
I just look at the good in people,
and why not tell them, you know?

24:59.414 --> 25:00.415
That's fantastic.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.584
-Are you playful?
-I'm very playful.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.295
I could tell you're playful.
I think that's important.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.798
-You're very dynamic, which is good.
-I am! Listen, I'm…

25:08.882 --> 25:11.593
You're never gonna expect
what comes out of my mouth next.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.677
No, it's good.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.222
Honestly, this has been
a fantastic conversation.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.224
-I agree, Shayne.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.356
Right now,
I'm kind of digging Shayne.

25:24.439 --> 25:28.276
I don't know what he looks like.
He just seems like this big teddy bear.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.696
You can tell
he has such a good heart and, like,

25:32.322 --> 25:34.908
Shayne and Shaina? That is so cute.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.202
I am so fucked.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.745


25:38.828 --> 25:42.374
What type of kisser are you?
I'm a tongue to stomach guy.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.085
I'm a tongue to your uvula type.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.839
How's your sex drive?
High? Low? How often?

25:49.923 --> 25:52.092
-All right, you <i>really</i> went to it.
-Oh yeah.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.178
-Give me a massage?
-Great massages.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.306
I love drunk sex, hangover sex.
I do everything.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.474
Oh really?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.642
Mm-hmm.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.685
Oh God.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.855
I don't know why I get so horny
when I'm hungover.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.107
Me too.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.985
-I'm going after you. I'm telling you.
-Got it.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.863
Well, I really, really like one guy.

26:13.947 --> 26:17.701
I'm kind of nervous that
he's gonna get vibes from the other guys

26:17.784 --> 26:20.662
because the other guys…
I think a lot of the other guys like me.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.834
A lot of them like me. I don't know.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.128
I have a lot of friends.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.797
You know,
some are in serious relationships,

26:31.298 --> 26:34.050
some are seeing multiple people.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.553
It's really hard for me
to really understand

26:36.636 --> 26:41.016
why a girl like me doesn't have
a boyfriend or a hook-up,

26:41.099 --> 26:44.978
or even someone I'm talking to.
Scale of one to ten, I'm a catch.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.272
I like Nick a lot.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.817
But there's another girl
that's really interested in him.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.739
Is it Holly or Molly?
Is the girl's name Holly or Molly?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.617
-Danielle.
-No, I think it's Holly.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.784
Yeah, it's Holly.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.746
Or Dolly or Molly.

27:03.330 --> 27:07.125
And she said that Nick told her
that she's his number one,

27:07.208 --> 27:09.878
but she's also tied
with another number one.

27:09.961 --> 27:14.382
Pretty sure that other number one is me
and I felt a little relieved,

27:14.466 --> 27:18.553
because I don't think she's that much
of a competition compared to me.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.681
What do you mean
she's not competition?

27:21.765 --> 27:22.891
He don't get to see you.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.936
I think he knows. I think he could tell.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.773
I just started talking shit
about everybody else.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.275
I probably shouldn't do that.
It's probably wrong.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.195
I don't think I should tell you guys
that I'm doing that.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.910
Bye. Good luck.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.209
-Hi.
-Hey. This is Nick. Who's this?

27:49.709 --> 27:51.753
-It's Trisha.
-Hey, Trisha.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.631
Why you guys are all so excited
to talk to me?

27:54.714 --> 27:58.093
Not trying to sound conceited, but
it's like all you guys are going after me.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.427


27:59.511 --> 28:02.847
-Don't tell 'em I said that.
-No, I'm not gonna say a word.

28:02.931 --> 28:06.559
Whatever you say in these pods,
it is safe with me. I'm a locked box.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.687
Okay, cool.
What do you do on the weekends?

28:08.770 --> 28:11.815
It depends. I usually hang out
with my friends on Saturday.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.024
I like to do yoga.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.236
I would love somebody
who'd work out with me. It's funny.

28:16.319 --> 28:20.490
I have a lot of Instagram followers
that see how hard I hit the gym.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.991
I think sometimes, like,

28:22.575 --> 28:25.829
girls or people get a little intimidated
by how much I work out.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.665
That they might not be able to keep up.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.750
-I don't know.
-Oh wow.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.961
What are you
looking for in a girl?

28:33.044 --> 28:35.714
For me, at the end of the day,

28:35.797 --> 28:39.551
if I want to see this person every day,
if I'm okay just sitting on the couch,

28:39.634 --> 28:41.261
if they're okay sitting with me.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.178
I love that.

28:42.262 --> 28:46.182
My biggest critique of dating apps,
but just dating in general,

28:46.266 --> 28:49.686
is there's this illusion of endless
opportunity and endless options.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.480
For some reason,
I don't really do online apps.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.523
How come?

28:53.606 --> 28:57.861
I'm going on dates with these people
that, like, I don't know at all.

28:57.944 --> 29:01.197
I don't want to, like,
waste my time and my calories.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.533
My time and my calories.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.827
-Wow.
-As selfish as that is.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.495
Yeah.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.580
Holy shit.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.125
I'm trying to not visualize
anyone in my head,

29:12.208 --> 29:13.918
because I'm trying to understand,

29:14.002 --> 29:16.713
is this someone
I can spend the rest of my life with,

29:16.796 --> 29:21.134
or is this someone that I can have,
you know, maybe a good time with?

29:21.217 --> 29:24.345
And what I really need to do
is find someone that is both.

29:24.429 --> 29:28.308
I have done so many things in my life
that I wanted to do.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.810
I'm the first person in my family
to graduate college.

29:30.894 --> 29:34.814
I have a great career, I have a condo,

29:34.898 --> 29:38.818
and the one thing I've been missing
is finding someone to share all that with.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.155
And that's a really important reason
why I'm here.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.740
What's up?

29:44.824 --> 29:46.034
Oh my gosh.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.122
Who's the lucky gentleman?

29:52.707 --> 29:54.834
I was a young girl, actually,

29:54.918 --> 29:59.297
probably like sixth grade.
I was walking home from school one day,

29:59.380 --> 30:02.133
and this guy that I really liked,
I was flirting with him,

30:02.217 --> 30:05.136
and I heard him turn around
and be like, "This girl's fat."

30:05.220 --> 30:07.514
It's weird because it was so long ago

30:07.597 --> 30:08.807
and I was so young…

30:08.890 --> 30:11.059
Let me in!

30:11.142 --> 30:13.269
…but now every interaction
I have with someone,

30:13.353 --> 30:15.605
I'm so scared they'll be like,
"Her arms look big,

30:15.688 --> 30:16.773
her stomach looks big."

30:16.856 --> 30:20.026
I still always will look in the mirror
and see that little fat girl.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.653
-All right. Good luck.
-You too.

30:24.030 --> 30:27.367
That's why I'm very excited to see,
are people gonna like me for who I am

30:27.450 --> 30:30.119
and I'm hoping
once they do get to know me,

30:30.620 --> 30:33.665
they'll think I'm beautiful,
regardless of what my weight might be.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.502
-Hello?
-Hello.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.879
-Who is this?
-This is Nick.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.173
-Hello.
-How's it going over there?

30:42.674 --> 30:46.553
-What are you thinking about?
-I mean… You right now, obviously.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.470
Yeah?

30:47.554 --> 30:50.515
I always look forward to talking to you,
but then I'm like,

30:50.598 --> 30:52.058
"He's gonna forget about me."

30:52.141 --> 30:53.184
Why do you think that?

30:53.268 --> 30:56.855
Because I'm scared that every other date
that you have will go better than ours.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.358
I'm an over-analyzer.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.026
Walk me through that.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.572
Like, there's been
a long history of divorce in my family.

31:05.655 --> 31:09.284
There is no relationship I've witnessed
that has been successful.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.494
-Uh-huh.
-And that's gonna be my fear.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.830
Am I going to be
following in the footsteps

31:13.913 --> 31:17.584
of everyone else in my family?
Are your parents still together?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.836
No. They've been divorced
since I was five.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.379
-Oh really?
-Yeah.

31:21.462 --> 31:25.508
Almost every relationship
I've witnessed has ended in divorce.

31:25.592 --> 31:29.470
I've been in relationships with a guy
who ends up making me feel insecure.

31:29.554 --> 31:33.057
I was dating a guy who every time
he was laying next to me in bed,

31:33.141 --> 31:36.769
he'd scroll through his phone and all
I'd see were girls that were, like…

31:37.270 --> 31:38.521
You know, like, not me.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.148
Jeez.

31:40.690 --> 31:44.360
And so, I would get so,
like, in my head about that.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.406
And growing up, I was a lot heavier.

31:48.990 --> 31:49.866
-So…
-Okay.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.118
So, I lost 70 pounds.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.786
-Seventy pounds.
-Yeah.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.372
Wow.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.334
But it was like…
I didn't even wanna tell you that.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.420
I don't like communicating it.
I'm so scared people will be like,

32:02.503 --> 32:04.088
"What if she gets back to that?"

32:04.172 --> 32:06.674
It's something
I'm constantly insecure about.

32:16.601 --> 32:20.355
I have to tell you, like,
I was a little chunky when I was a kid.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.191
-Yeah?
-But really, college was where I…

32:23.274 --> 32:26.861
I was, like, getting into health
and making sure I work out.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.824
I'm not, like, a gym rat, by any means.
I'm on the slimmer side of the dad bod.

32:31.908 --> 32:32.909
I like the dad bod.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.580
Nick can't see me. He has no idea
I'm not still 200 pounds.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.958
He has to trust
that he'll love me for who I am

32:40.041 --> 32:42.168
because he has no idea what size I am.

32:42.251 --> 32:45.004
He doesn't know
if I'm still heavier, still overweight.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.048
He just knows that I <i>have been</i> heavier.

32:47.131 --> 32:50.051
So for someone
to pull that story out of me

32:50.134 --> 32:51.928
within such a short period of time,

32:52.011 --> 32:56.140
it shows how comfortable I am with him
and how comfortable he makes me feel.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.476
I know. I know.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.646
I think your partner
needs to be your best friend.

33:01.729 --> 33:04.857
Exactly. The number one,
most important thing is making sure

33:04.941 --> 33:07.610
it's someone you wanna spend
every waking second with.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.528
Right.

33:08.611 --> 33:11.489
I've been in relationships like,
"This is my best friend,"

33:11.572 --> 33:14.826
and I've been in relationships like,
"I wouldn't be best friends."

33:14.909 --> 33:18.413
That's why I don't feel as passionately
about them as someone else,

33:18.496 --> 33:20.164
because it doesn't click that way.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.874
Right. That's exactly it.

33:21.958 --> 33:22.875
My God.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.504
I just want to be by you.

33:26.587 --> 33:30.049
I know.
I'm, like, a very touchy-feely person.

33:30.133 --> 33:35.555
It's hard for me right now not to be,
like… touching when I'm talking to you.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.348
I know.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.351
I find myself, like,
petting the couch instead.

33:57.076 --> 34:00.580
-Oh. Food?
-Got it. It's our love language, honey.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.167
-How many more are you doing?
-I have four more.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.252
-Yeah.
-It's already burning.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.796
-Side planks.
-You wanna face each other?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.424
-No. Shut up.
-Stare into each other's eyes?

34:11.507 --> 34:14.469
You don't work in the corporate world,
you own your own thing.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.639
People who work in the corporate world,
I feel there's a little brainwash in them.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.683
They talk like they're in a TED Talk.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.643
-You are 1,000% right.
-I don't like that.

34:22.727 --> 34:25.063
There is such a narrow way of thinking.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.940
When you're in the corporate world,
they'll program your brain

34:28.024 --> 34:30.068
where you'll be like,
"Guys, you know what?"

34:30.151 --> 34:32.445
I do sense a lot of that in there.

34:32.528 --> 34:35.114
-It's why I'm hyper-aware of all of that.
-Yeah.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.535
I came to <i>Love Is Blind</i>
because people are very materialistic.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.954
I've been rejected in the past

34:42.038 --> 34:45.917
because I don't have
that fancy white collar job.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.460
I'm a construction worker.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.295
I'm kind of rough around the edges.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.380
-All right.
-Let's go!

34:51.464 --> 34:54.509
I believe the right woman
will fall in love with me,

34:54.592 --> 34:59.680
because she'll understand
my stupid humor and dumb jokes.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.517
And the fact that
I don't need fancy things.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.646
-Hello.
-Hi, honey.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.524
-Shaina.
-I love how you say my name.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.860
-Oh, Shaina.
-Shaina. You say my name very good.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.154
-Shaina.
-You probably have the best voice here.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.406
-Stop lying.
-No, I'm serious.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.910
-With you, it's effortless.
-Really?

35:20.993 --> 35:23.162
-Yeah.
-You are so cute.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.248
-How are you?

35:25.331 --> 35:27.416
Cut my finger open,
I was bleeding everywhere.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.585
Know what you need to do?
Superglue it.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.587
The Superglue thing is so true.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.714
You wanna know where I got it from?
My dad.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.134
-"My dad."
-You making fun of me?

35:36.217 --> 35:37.927
-Yeah.
-I like when you do that.

35:38.010 --> 35:38.928
"My dad."

35:40.805 --> 35:42.098
-I'm not kidding.
-I know.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.725
My dad's a contractor
and my brothers all work for my dad.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.435
Wow. You know my breed.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.814
Are you kidding me? After how hard
you guys work your asses off?

35:49.897 --> 35:51.983
I respect it. I feel we have a bond now.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.694
What's my breed?
You think I'm rough around the edges?

35:54.777 --> 35:56.487
-Yeah, totally.
-I'm not.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.699
-I'm actually like a nurturer.
-I love that about you.

35:59.782 --> 36:00.950
-Aw.
-"Aw."

36:01.868 --> 36:03.494
-Here's a good scenario.
-Tell me.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.580
I work outside
and it's fucking freezing.

36:05.663 --> 36:09.625
I'll have dinner made for you.
We lay on the couch, I'll rub your feet.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.003
That's so sweet.
I'm gonna cry a little bit.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.297
Are you old soul?

36:14.380 --> 36:17.967
-100%. It's because of my dad.
-Me too. Is he your biggest influence?

36:18.050 --> 36:19.802
-No, my mom is.
-Your mama?

36:19.886 --> 36:22.471
Yeah. My mom's
the best person in the world.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.515
-That's how I feel about my mom.
-Awesome.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.476
That means
they did something right with you.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.312
Aw. Same thing with you.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.271
Yeah.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.732
-Are you ready for marriage?
-Yeah, definitely.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.985
So, I was actually engaged before.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.988
Long story short, God said, "No."

36:39.071 --> 36:40.615
What does that mean?

36:42.408 --> 36:45.620
He was honestly, like,
very, very, very, very, very controlling.

36:45.703 --> 36:50.041
Like, crazy. We called off the wedding,
like, 40 days before the wedding.

36:50.124 --> 36:53.419
It was probably the craziest time
of my life, but I grew a lot.

36:53.502 --> 36:56.172
Yeah. And it makes you happier now, right?

36:56.255 --> 36:57.340
I'm so free.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.760
I now know who I am and what I want.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.136
And then you met me.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.389
-Touché.
-How about it?

37:05.473 --> 37:06.724
-Touché, Kyle.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.230
Right now, like,
my top two are Kyle and Shayne.

37:12.313 --> 37:16.484
Kyle, I think he's witty. Probably one
of the funniest people I've ever met.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.237
But with Shayne,
he definitely has that energy

37:19.320 --> 37:20.613
that kind of draws you in.

37:20.696 --> 37:21.739
I'm goin'.

37:21.822 --> 37:25.952
And I feel like we do have the same vision
for what we would want in a marriage.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.370
-Hello.
-Hello.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.413
-Shaina.
-Hi, Shayne.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.040
-How you doing?
-Good.

37:31.123 --> 37:33.626
Shaina matches my energy,
and gets me excited.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.963
And never got the vibe
that she's judging me.

37:37.630 --> 37:41.509
I appreciate that,
because my mouth gets me in trouble a lot.

37:43.010 --> 37:47.556
Yesterday was more fun and casual,
but today I want to, like, get deep.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.392
-Yeah, let's get into it.
-You want to?

37:49.475 --> 37:50.768
-I know you do.
-Oh yeah.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.938
I'm gonna get deep
inside of your thoughts right now.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.107
That sounds very intriguing.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.110
-I'm intense.
-Oh my God. I love it.

37:59.193 --> 38:01.988
What are you wearing right now?
Give me your outfit details.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.823
Okay, so I'm actually wearing heels.

38:03.906 --> 38:07.576
I'm wearing, like,
these cute jogger slacks with a crop top.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.913
-Oh, I love crop tops so much.
-Do you love a crop top?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.331
I love a crop top.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.917
Just enough to tease you a little bit but…

38:15.001 --> 38:16.335
Yes! Oh my God, I love it.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.212
-Okay. So, question.
-What's up?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.839
-You like making out?
-I love everything.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.758
-Okay, so I'm a very sexual person.
-Yes.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.761
So, like, I would ideally like every day.

38:26.262 --> 38:29.140
-Five times a day, at least…
-My God! That was my answer before!

38:29.223 --> 38:33.644
-To who?! Oh my God! Oh my goodness!
-No, but he was asking me. No.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.897
Honey, no. He was asking me,
you know what I'm saying? How many?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.858
-Yeah.
-Honestly, I was like…

38:38.941 --> 38:42.236
Like, I'm like,
"If you can handle it, let's go all day."

38:42.320 --> 38:44.613
-You're hilarious.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.199
I'm the guy that will…
We're at a restaurant.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.244
Let's go to the bathroom.
Let's fuck around, do stuff like that.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.455
-Hello.
-I love, like, outdoor stuff.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.999
I don't know if you can keep up.
That's what I worry about.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.126
Don't underestimate me. You have no idea.

38:57.209 --> 39:01.505
Is there a way to elaborate, or you gonna
keep me going to bed now just dreaming…

39:01.589 --> 39:05.009
-I'm gonna keep you dreaming.
-Oh my God. It's not fair.

39:05.092 --> 39:07.094
This wall needs to go away right now.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.806
I'm at this point
where it's like dating two people,

39:10.890 --> 39:12.475
and I'm getting serious feelings.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.644
With Shaina,
it's flirty fun, like sexiness.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.439
It is a roller coaster of emotions.

39:19.815 --> 39:22.651
With Natalie,
it feels way more emotionally stimulating.

39:22.735 --> 39:26.030
There is playfulness in it,
but there's also a good balance of, like,

39:26.530 --> 39:27.531
seriousness too.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.995
Do you think
that you're ready for marriage?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.206
I think about that all the time,

39:35.289 --> 39:37.500
because my father passed away
a few months ago.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.254
Oh my gosh.
That's so tough. I'm so sorry.

39:44.590 --> 39:49.553
I don't remember the last conversation
I had with him. So it was very difficult

39:49.637 --> 39:51.680
to process that and everything,

39:51.764 --> 39:56.227
but it made me stop and realize that
life is short and this is what I want.

39:56.310 --> 39:59.522
And I'm ready to find someone
and commit to someone

39:59.605 --> 40:03.150
because I want my mom to see my wedding.
I want my mom to have grandchildren

40:03.234 --> 40:06.237
and I want her to be able
to be a part of that, and see that.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.614
I'm looking for someone
that's gonna challenge me

40:08.697 --> 40:10.074
and make me a better person.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.369
I see it in my brother and his fiancée,

40:13.452 --> 40:17.373
and I want that euphoria you get
from providing for someone,

40:17.456 --> 40:19.834
and just having someone by your side.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.419
That is so important to me.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.630
-And I can't wait to have that.
-That's so nice to hear.

40:24.713 --> 40:27.258
I'm glad you said that.
I'm right there with you.

40:27.341 --> 40:32.221
Your honesty gives me affirmation
that this is a true and good connection.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.932
Oh my gosh. I'm stumbling over my words.

40:35.015 --> 40:35.850
It's fine.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.853
There's also something about your voice.

40:38.936 --> 40:42.231
I can't pinpoint it,
but I just feel really good about this.

40:42.815 --> 40:46.610
There's a heart with your name
right in the middle of my notebook.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.613
I autographed it, number one.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.324
I love talking to you.
You already know that.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.242
Yeah.

40:53.325 --> 40:56.287
I think it's times like these
where I feel like, "Was this fate?"

40:56.370 --> 40:59.457
-If that makes sense.
-This is the start of everything. Yeah.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.959
-I…
-I got you, girl.

41:02.042 --> 41:05.045
I'm on cloud nine.
I'm smiling all the time.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.631
Like, there's an extra step in my skip.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.049
No, that's not right.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.218
Everything feels so right.

41:11.302 --> 41:15.181
The things I didn't know
were missing in my life, he fulfills it.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.642
It actually grosses myself out.
Like, who am I?

41:23.856 --> 41:24.857
God had a plan.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.318
So, things are copacetic?

41:27.943 --> 41:29.278
Yes. She's number one.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.780
-Look at that.
-I know. I had all six.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.701
-Lights out.
-It's lights out.

41:35.784 --> 41:38.245
Shayne's my guy. I'm so happy.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.457
-I am literally obsessed.
-Wait, why? What happened?

41:41.540 --> 41:45.169
I've thought about him this entire time
and he just validated it.

41:45.252 --> 41:47.880
-I feel like this is it.
-Aww!

41:48.631 --> 41:50.424
-Yay!
-Aww.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.967
-So cute!
-Oh my God.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.261
He put my name on his notebook.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.930
-Like, on the front page.
-What?

41:56.013 --> 41:58.974
And has been telling guys,
"It's gonna be Natalie."

41:59.058 --> 42:01.936
-Wait, what's his last name?
-Oh, I don't know.

42:02.561 --> 42:05.189
Everyone's dating everybody,
but, right now,

42:05.272 --> 42:07.816
I need Shayne to tell me what he wants.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.569
-I know.
-The future Mrs. Shayne.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.280
You're all invited
to the wedding.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.456
-Hello.
-Hello.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.791
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.504
-I heard you proposed today, basically.
-What?

42:29.421 --> 42:30.422
To Natalie.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.930
Are you sold on one person here?
One woman already?

42:41.267 --> 42:42.393
I'll be honest with ya.

42:42.476 --> 42:46.480
I just wanna keep talking to you
and I wanna keep getting to know you more.

42:50.484 --> 42:53.070
I'm processing it,
by the way, if I'm quiet.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.992
This whole process, I believe is,
like, why not just see it out?

43:09.587 --> 43:10.546
Anyways…

43:11.213 --> 43:12.631
Anyways…

43:16.051 --> 43:17.386
What are you wearing over there?

43:18.053 --> 43:20.806
I'm in this cute little matching set.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.891
Like, high-waisted shorts
with this crop top,

43:22.975 --> 43:24.643
and I have this big flannel over it.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.024
That's so sexy.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.068
Can I wear your flannel?

43:34.278 --> 43:36.780
Oh yeah.
You can wear it in the bedroom, though.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.115
Of course.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.160
Oh my God, dear Lord.

44:00.554 --> 44:04.767


44:04.850 --> 44:07.645
-Are you drinking alcohol yet?
-No. Want to start together.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.981
-I didn't want to do it alone.
-Who took the Champagne?

44:14.276 --> 44:17.363
-Maybe I'll have that breakfast burrito.
-Dude, give me half of it.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.989
-You wanna do it?
-Can I have half?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.075
I'm gonna deconstruct
that breakfast burrito.

44:24.370 --> 44:28.290
This is such a crazy experiment
and I'm feeling so much so quickly.

44:28.374 --> 44:32.336
Where, like, I've never been
with someone who I wholeheartedly trust

44:32.419 --> 44:34.004
in every single way.

44:34.088 --> 44:37.132
With Nick, from every single hour
since we met has been talking

44:37.216 --> 44:40.678
and getting to know each other,
and it's almost as if we knew each other,

44:40.761 --> 44:44.098
like, our entire lives,
but we just met a couple days ago.

44:44.181 --> 44:48.143
I have a boyfriend and I don't know
what he looks like. It's strange.

44:48.227 --> 44:50.145
And he's, like, two feet away.

44:50.229 --> 44:54.274
You literally have a woman over there.
The ball is in your court.

44:54.358 --> 44:58.612
I know. I'm taking the fucking ball.
I decided two days ago, it was Danielle.

44:58.696 --> 45:02.700
And I am all in,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.036
and I'm gonna tell her.

45:08.330 --> 45:09.415
Have fun!

45:09.498 --> 45:11.166
Ooh!

45:15.504 --> 45:19.216
Being with Danielle
makes me feel calm, content,

45:19.717 --> 45:23.011
and I think the connection
that we built is so strong,

45:23.095 --> 45:24.596
and it's unique in so many ways.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.808
But I really attribute it to the fact
that we've been able to dive in

45:27.891 --> 45:31.061
and spend hours and hours and hours
getting to know one another

45:31.145 --> 45:34.231
in a way that takes months,
if not years, in the real world.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.902
-I love farmers markets.
-I love them too.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.279
Oh my gosh. Let's go.

45:40.362 --> 45:44.533
Yeah. They're so much fun to go
with someone to, rather than by yourself.

45:44.616 --> 45:47.202
It's so much more fun.
Perfect. That's on the bucket list.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.496
Okay. We've got that.
Gotta do a bike ride.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.039
-Oh yeah.
-Yeah.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.625
If someone else is feeling an emotion,
I feel it.

45:53.709 --> 45:57.421
Same here. I dated someone
a while back, like, five years ago,

45:57.504 --> 46:01.759
and she kind of, like, would tell me
that my empathy was a weakness.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.095
That's-- I mean, I think that's
a toxic trait for her to think that.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.096
Oh, totally.

46:06.180 --> 46:09.224
Because, I, like,
I love empathetic people.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.184
-Me too.
-Yeah.

46:10.267 --> 46:14.354
And I can relate to them in a way
that I can't relate to most people.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.149
-I guess it's probably the same for you?
-No, exactly. Yeah.

46:17.232 --> 46:20.110
I have so many
different groups of friends.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.404
I think part of the reason
is because of that.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.198
That's so funny. I'm the same way.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.533
Did we talk about having kids?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.995
I want to have kids, but I wanna
make sure that we're able to travel…

46:30.078 --> 46:33.207
-Same. Spend time together before--
-Yeah. Exactly.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.125
…we spend time with the family.

46:35.209 --> 46:39.004
I don't wanna put a timeline on it.
I feel like you'll feel when you're ready.

46:39.087 --> 46:40.380
-That's how I feel too.
-Yep.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.217
I thought about you
so much yesterday after we left.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.596
There's just some… Like, last night,
I could not get you out of my mind.

46:47.679 --> 46:49.598
I'm like that. I'm in the same exact way.

46:49.681 --> 46:51.725
I think we're at a place
where we already know

46:51.809 --> 46:53.769
what the other's thinking
without saying it.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.521
It's weird and that's why, like--

46:55.604 --> 46:59.024
I've seen so many relationships,
like, something always has to happen.

46:59.107 --> 47:01.443
So, I'm like, something bad
is gonna happen.

47:02.027 --> 47:04.196
-Why do I cry so easily?
-It's okay.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.533
-I'm emotional.
-It's okay. I wish I could hug you.

47:07.616 --> 47:10.369
I know. I cry very easily.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.162
When I'm happy, when I'm sad.

47:12.246 --> 47:16.166
-When I'm mad. So, that's all I got.
-That's okay. I like that.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.127
You're sensitive. Be you. I like you.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.755
Here's what I want you to do.
Did you open your Ring Pop?

47:21.839 --> 47:23.757
-No, I did not.
-Open your Ring Pop.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.635
I hope it's sized correctly.

47:26.718 --> 47:29.304
-Put that on your ring finger.
-I will.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.098
Imagine it's a princess cut.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.644
Yes. I'm so happy.

47:35.727 --> 47:40.607
Like, you make me happier than…
I don't know, I ever have been.

47:41.775 --> 47:44.361
I've never been
in any sort of relationship

47:44.444 --> 47:49.032
where I haven't had reservations,
or I haven't felt the kind of anxiety

47:49.116 --> 47:52.870
that I typically feel,
and that's what's, like… It's so weird

47:52.953 --> 47:55.914
and I don't believe it
because I don't know, like…

47:55.998 --> 47:57.916
This is what you do. You mess things up

47:58.000 --> 48:01.295
by creating scenarios that don't exist.
Like, I don't deserve you.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.547
-Stop. Don't ever think that.
-Yeah.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.049
We're gonna be partners,
and be in this together.

48:06.133 --> 48:06.967
It's you and me.

48:07.050 --> 48:11.305
I love her strength
to share some of her insecurities.

48:11.388 --> 48:14.892
And I trust her completely.
I'm not afraid to tell her anything.

48:15.517 --> 48:18.770
I'm an acquired taste. I kind of act
in an acquired taste kind of way,

48:18.854 --> 48:20.814
and I've never felt like this.

48:20.898 --> 48:26.778
And it just seems to me
like that connection is so powerful

48:26.862 --> 48:30.991
that I can't imagine a life without her<i>,</i>

48:31.074 --> 48:34.036
and we never have
actually seen one another.

48:34.703 --> 48:37.873
That's just so crazy.
It's just mind-blowing.

48:46.298 --> 48:47.174
How are you?

48:47.257 --> 48:49.593
-Good. How are you feeling?
-Feeling really good.

48:49.676 --> 48:52.346
-Your gift's in here.
-I know.

48:54.014 --> 48:57.643
When I first met you,
I was very attracted to your energy.

48:58.602 --> 49:00.979
Then, as I got to know you,

49:01.480 --> 49:03.440
and I got to know your story,

49:03.523 --> 49:07.861
and I got to know what makes you tick,
and why you are the way you are,

49:07.945 --> 49:11.406
and why you think the way you think,
and feel the way you feel,

49:11.907 --> 49:13.533
I felt connected to you

49:14.034 --> 49:19.164
in a way that I don't know
if I've ever really felt before.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.082
Yeah.

49:20.582 --> 49:23.418
And we talked
about coming from families

49:23.502 --> 49:27.214
where we didn't have
an ideal marriage to look at,

49:27.297 --> 49:31.385
and we talked about
how we could write our own story.

49:31.468 --> 49:34.513
And now, if you wanna open the gift…

49:37.557 --> 49:40.519
This is the start of our story,

49:40.602 --> 49:43.563
where we meet in these pods
and we don't get to see each other.

49:43.647 --> 49:47.776
But this is where it begins for us.
The rest of that book, it's empty

49:47.859 --> 49:49.695
and we can fill it with memories

49:49.778 --> 49:52.114
and adventures of everything
that a marriage can be.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.080
I'm on one knee.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.540
Oh no.

50:02.374 --> 50:05.627
And I'm asking you if you will marry me.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.719
Yes. Oh my God.

50:17.681 --> 50:21.393
I'm gonna hug the wall right now.
Oh my God.

50:21.476 --> 50:23.061
I want to hug you so bad.

50:23.145 --> 50:27.524
Yes. Oh my God. Yes. I'm literally…
Stand against the wall and hug me back.

50:30.569 --> 50:31.403
I'm gonna cry.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.698
-I can't wait to marry you.
-I know.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.326
I'm so happy.

50:38.410 --> 50:40.996
Like, I genuinely am in love
and I think that he is too.

50:41.079 --> 50:43.832
And this experiment makes me feel
like it was meant to be.

50:43.915 --> 50:46.001
It's starting to sound like a fairy tale.

50:47.502 --> 50:50.464
Knowing how anxious I get all the time,

50:50.547 --> 50:54.092
and, like, how calm I felt today,
and how happy I was today,

50:54.176 --> 50:58.263
and not having a care in the world
other than looking forward to seeing you.

50:58.346 --> 51:02.142
Like, I've never had that
in any relationship or situation.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.769
Like, with work, with nothing.

51:03.852 --> 51:07.731
And I am the kind of person
who's constantly second-guessing myself,

51:07.814 --> 51:10.484
and then second-guessing
why someone wants to be with me.

51:10.567 --> 51:14.071
And now I don't have to do that
because I know exactly why.

51:14.154 --> 51:15.989
And I'm gonna make sure you always know.

51:16.073 --> 51:20.160
I typically don't trust the words that
are coming out of people's mouths,

51:20.243 --> 51:22.913
but I trust every single thing
that you say. Fully.

51:24.790 --> 51:27.375
-I wanna see you so bad right now.
-That's what's so hard.

51:27.459 --> 51:29.169
I need to hug something.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.089
I love you.

51:32.172 --> 51:34.382
-I love you.

51:42.474 --> 51:45.268
-We're engaged.
-It's so great, babe.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.689
-Love you.
-Love you too.

51:52.442 --> 51:53.276
I know.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.407
Look at how cute this is.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.743
-Are you engaged?
-Yeah.

52:04.287 --> 52:06.540
-All right! Yeah!

52:06.623 --> 52:07.499
Wedding day…

52:07.582 --> 52:09.793
-Oh my God!
-You're engaged!

52:09.876 --> 52:11.044
Oh my God!

52:17.050 --> 52:18.009
Aloha.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.220
Every time I talk to Shayne,

52:20.303 --> 52:24.975
I feel just so confident
and so overwhelmingly happy.

52:25.058 --> 52:26.560
Like, my gut is just saying,

52:27.144 --> 52:29.646
"I'm going to spend
the rest of my life with him."

52:30.230 --> 52:32.482
I truly feel like he's the one.

52:35.652 --> 52:36.945
-Hello.
-Hi.

52:37.028 --> 52:39.281
-Who am I talking to?
-I don't know. Take a guess.

52:39.364 --> 52:41.158
No, the… Oh, Shaina. There you go.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.661
-What?
-That's who I was hoping for.

52:45.912 --> 52:47.539
What are you wearing over there?

52:50.041 --> 52:50.876
Hello?

52:52.377 --> 52:53.795
Hello? Shaina, stop.

52:54.838 --> 52:55.755
It's Natalie.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.090
Of course.

52:58.967 --> 52:59.843
I'm sorry.

53:04.973 --> 53:05.807
Are you okay?

53:07.684 --> 53:08.643
Are you good?

53:11.521 --> 53:14.107
Like, what…
Do you think I'm a dick or what?

53:16.443 --> 53:17.360
I mean…

53:17.444 --> 53:21.156
If you think I'm a dick, I feel like
that's kind of weird. No offense, but…

53:27.454 --> 53:30.790
Natalie, you're talking to other people
too, right? Are you not?

53:34.127 --> 53:34.961
Hello?

53:36.296 --> 53:37.130
Hello?

53:38.465 --> 53:40.217
-Hello?
-Yeah, I'm here.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.843
I'm just thinking.

53:42.344 --> 53:45.972
-Why?
-I just feel, like, a little bit led on.

53:46.056 --> 53:46.932
For real?

53:47.432 --> 53:49.434
-Yeah. Kind of.
-How so?

53:49.935 --> 53:52.562
If you want to explore another connection,

53:52.646 --> 53:55.649
then don't talk about, like,
what we're gonna do in Chicago

53:55.732 --> 53:58.652
and, like, all this stuff.
Like, don't say that.

53:58.735 --> 54:00.779
So I'm gonna be honest with you,

54:00.862 --> 54:03.198
because I'm trying
to give everyone an open mind

54:03.281 --> 54:07.661
going into our conversations.
I don't ever wanna make you feel bad,

54:07.744 --> 54:12.249
but I'm here to, like,
try to, like, find my wife.

54:12.332 --> 54:16.044
I'm giving everything I have to it.
I'm a very passionate person.

54:16.127 --> 54:18.546
I have to talk to other people.

54:18.630 --> 54:24.386
I was just hurt because I've been very
clear that I have strong feelings for you

54:24.469 --> 54:26.930
and clearly you have feelings
for her and that's fine.

54:27.013 --> 54:30.058
-But don't lead me on and just be honest--
-I'm not leading you on.

54:30.141 --> 54:32.143
I'm not trying to lead you on whatsoever.

54:32.227 --> 54:35.480
You're on the cover of my book
with a heart on it, for Christ's sake.

54:35.563 --> 54:38.108
You're my number one.
I want you to know that.

54:41.361 --> 54:42.904
I'm here for the right reasons--

54:42.988 --> 54:45.407
I'm not doubting
you're here for the right reasons,

54:45.490 --> 54:47.242
but don't, like, feed me bullshit.

54:53.873 --> 54:56.209
This is not fair.
It's not fair at all.

54:56.293 --> 54:59.587
-Can I finish?
-I'm put in this position. It's like…

54:59.671 --> 55:01.923
This is not normal,
what we're going through.

55:02.007 --> 55:04.259
Why am I getting,
I guess, beat up about it?

55:04.342 --> 55:07.345
It's like… This is the whole experience.

55:07.429 --> 55:09.848
I don't wanna make you feel
like you're being beat up.

55:09.931 --> 55:12.100
I'm not trying to come after you at all.

55:12.183 --> 55:14.185
I'm trying to understand, truly.

55:14.269 --> 55:16.938
I don't want you to be mad or frustrated--

55:17.022 --> 55:20.942
I'm very frustrated because I don't know
how much more reassurance I can give you.

55:22.610 --> 55:26.114
What I'm trying to figure out is
if you think this is going anywhere.

55:30.452 --> 55:33.580
If… this little hiccup is, like,

55:33.663 --> 55:36.082
that big of a deal,
and that changes everything,

55:36.166 --> 55:39.419
then maybe this is not
what we thought it was, I guess.

55:50.096 --> 55:52.390
I'm just done
with this whole situation right now.

55:53.224 --> 55:57.395
I'm gonna leave. It's not worth it
for me being here anymore.

56:05.653 --> 56:06.488
Fuck.

56:21.795 --> 56:22.879
What happened?

56:22.962 --> 56:25.006
I don't even want to be here anymore.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.758
-Hey, girl!

56:27.342 --> 56:28.760
Natalie, are you okay?

56:28.843 --> 56:30.303
No, not at all.

56:32.097 --> 56:33.515
Okay. Okay.

56:33.598 --> 56:34.641
It's fine. It's fine.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.357
I'm bouncing.

57:04.003 --> 57:09.300
I've chosen Danielle to be my wife.
Someone that I've never even seen before.

57:09.801 --> 57:10.760
I'm shocked.

57:11.261 --> 57:14.514
I would've never guessed this days ago,
but it's real.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.686
Everyone wants to be loved
for who they are on the inside,

57:19.769 --> 57:22.939
and I feel so grateful I was able
to go through this experience,

57:23.022 --> 57:24.983
to finally find someone who truly does.

57:25.066 --> 57:26.693
No doubt in my mind that he does.

57:26.776 --> 57:29.446
There's no doubt
that I love Nick for who he is.

57:30.738 --> 57:33.992
I know him and he knows me
more than anyone else.

57:36.119 --> 57:38.830
The fact that she's chosen me

57:38.913 --> 57:43.835
to be a partner and get married to
and be her husband the rest of her life

57:43.918 --> 57:48.047
is one of the most humbling
and satisfying feelings

57:48.131 --> 57:49.591
I think I've ever felt.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.761
I don't feel I've ever had a connection

57:53.845 --> 57:56.639
or really had this type of love
with someone before.

57:56.723 --> 58:00.518
I think she's the greatest person
probably in the entire world.

58:06.816 --> 58:09.444
I've tried
picturing seeing Nick

58:09.527 --> 58:11.321
and not liking him in my head

58:11.404 --> 58:12.864
a thousand times.

58:12.947 --> 58:15.658
I pictured him as, like, one-foot tall.

58:15.742 --> 58:19.537
I pictured him as eight-feet tall,
as 300 pounds, as 50 pounds.

58:19.621 --> 58:22.874
I pictured him
in every single physical way possible.

58:23.374 --> 58:26.878
I've been almost, like,
picturing him as a big blue wall

58:26.961 --> 58:30.173
because that is what I'm staring at
every time we have a conversation.

58:30.256 --> 58:33.218
The fact that I already feel
like the luckiest girl in the world,

58:33.301 --> 58:35.428
how can I not be attracted to him?

58:35.512 --> 58:40.141
He could walk out with no teeth
and I'd still go and kiss his mouth. So…

58:46.397 --> 58:48.650
My biggest fear
coming into <i>Love Is Blind</i>

58:48.733 --> 58:51.027
was that someone was
going to see me for the first time

58:51.110 --> 58:54.906
and I wasn't going to exceed
their expectations in terms of looks.

58:54.989 --> 58:57.700
And I feel so strongly
about the connection I have with Nick

58:57.784 --> 59:00.161
that I don't even necessarily
have that fear anymore.

59:00.245 --> 59:03.039
I think he's such a good person
and such a good match for me,

59:03.122 --> 59:06.668
that I think he'll see me for who I am
and think I'm beautiful regardless.

59:06.751 --> 59:10.088
But you always want the love of your life
to think you're beautiful.

59:12.048 --> 59:14.300
It's crazy. I have goosebumps. Like,

59:14.384 --> 59:17.262
"Don't look at my legs,
because the hair's growing."

59:50.336 --> 59:53.464
