<i>"If I had your powers."</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:44.562
<i>You've heard me say that a thousand times.</i>

01:51.653 --> 01:55.073
<i>Maybe I can finally do something...</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:56.782
<i>special.</i>

02:09.545 --> 02:13.883
<i>I've wished for this so hard,
but I never thought it would happen.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:19.097
<i>But it has.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:33.194
<i>Now, all I want is to share it with you.</i>

02:37.490 --> 02:38.950
<i>But I took something from you.</i>

02:41.202 --> 02:42.662
<i>I can't change that.</i>

02:45.748 --> 02:47.083
<i>And you need time.</i>

02:48.543 --> 02:49.919
<i>I can't hurry that.</i>

02:52.463 --> 02:54.048
<i>I'll be ready when you are.</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:42.138
One. One, two.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.723
One, two, slip, cross.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.227
You training with somebody else
on the side, huh? One.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.813
Shit.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.734
Ah! Ouch.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.570
Come on. Guard your chin.
Engage your core.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.989
That's it. Steroids, right? You juicing?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.200
Kale.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.960
One... one, two, three.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.543
Yes!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.129
Yes! Yes! Yes!

04:57.297 --> 04:58.298
Yes!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.105
<i>Now what?</i>

05:14.897 --> 05:16.399
<i>That's what I'd ask you,</i>

05:17.025 --> 05:19.652
<i>but you're still putting
the pieces back together.</i>

05:19.736 --> 05:22.864
<i>So I'll use everything I've gleaned
from you over the years.</i>

05:46.387 --> 05:50.516
<i>You'd never admit it, but maybe you
picked up a little something from me, too.</i>

05:55.188 --> 05:56.189
Thank you.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.943
These stools aren't built for adult butts.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.196
But the coffee's good
and you wanted to talk.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.324
Over lunch, at an actual restaurant.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.951
I swear, we spent more time together
when you were in a coma.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.371
My schedule's a little hectic.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.289
Impressive, considering
you don't have a job.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.209
Mother, things are different now.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.211
I need a little time to myself.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.380
And I suppose I understand.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.384
After all you went through.
That awful doctor...

06:25.385 --> 06:26.594
Jessica's mother.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.513
It's worse for Jessica.

06:28.596 --> 06:32.725
Well, shooting that monster is the one
heroic thing Jessica has ever done.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.227
So they say.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.396
You know, she's advertising now.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.023
Trying to be a hero.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.547
As long as she leaves you out of it.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.068
Oh, I'm out of it all right.

06:42.151 --> 06:45.571
You don't need her,
but you need someone in your corner.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.490
You've isolated yourself.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.742
Well, it seems to come with the territory.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.994
What territory?

06:53.496 --> 06:56.374
It just... Is this what
you wanted to talk about?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.960
You need someone you can trust

06:59.043 --> 07:02.755
to help you turn your unique talents
into opportunities.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.882
And we're back on my career.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.052
<i>Patsy </i> residuals aren't gonna
cover your mortgage, baby girl.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.929
You're my mother, not my agent.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.722
The phone rings, I answer.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.640
Uh-huh.

07:12.723 --> 07:16.477
Ironically, the calls increased
after you blew up your radio show.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.729
Ironically, I don't care.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.858
They are offering you a spot
on a celebrity dance show.

07:21.941 --> 07:22.775
No.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.610
You've always moved so well.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.695
Not happening.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.198
Fashion. You like fashion.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.783
Usually.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.327
There is a clothing company in Tampa.

07:33.411 --> 07:37.039
They are looking for a face
for their new collection.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
Are you done?

07:38.708 --> 07:42.003
Well, you could run for president.
A petition's being circulated online.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.005
Well, consider that my retirement plan.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.257
All right, I will find something else.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.219
No. I am pursuing something on my own.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.138
Please don't say, "Chekhov in the Park."

07:52.221 --> 07:55.683
It's not on camera or on a stage.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.478
Well, honey, you're a performer.
Without that, you're...

07:58.561 --> 08:00.480
- Nothing?
- No. Just...

08:02.148 --> 08:03.483
unemployable.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.526
I gotta go.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.738
- Oh... I've only had you 20 minutes.
- I'll call you.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.741
Don't shut me out
like Jessica's shutting you out.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.242
You're just kicking the dog.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.661
I'm not shutting you out,
and you're no dog.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.456
I'll call you.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.957
Pats.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.014
<i>Seven Lincoln one, 10-52.</i>

08:32.053 --> 08:34.304
<i>Crescent Heights apartments

08:34.388 --> 08:35.515
<i>RP is manager.</i>

08:37.558 --> 08:40.394
<i>We've got
a noise complaint on 112th and Amsterdam.</i>

08:40.477 --> 08:41.395
Back off!

08:41.479 --> 08:43.479
<i>Neighbors are
reporting music too loud.</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:45.691
<i>Northwest corner of Washington and Spring.</i>

08:47.318 --> 08:49.078
<i>We've got

08:49.153 --> 08:50.947
<i>yelling obscenities at a bus driver.</i>

08:52.156 --> 08:53.491
<i>Copy, 42 Charlie.</i>

08:53.574 --> 08:56.285
<i>A purse was taken out
of a parked car in the driveway.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.996
<i>Black sedan, already has one ticket on it.</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:01.791
<i>Subject is
drunk and disorderly.</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:04.377
<i>- Subject is drunk and disorderly.</i>
- Hey, sweetheart.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.422
<i>We've got a break-in
at Sally's Pets on 45th and 7th.</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:09.674
<i>Cats released.</i>

09:10.967 --> 09:13.678
<i>Caller claims
his neighbor is urinating on his Prius.</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:20.092
<i>Need evidence tech.
Recovered some items...</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:34.448
<i>At least one of us
is making a difference.</i>

09:36.826 --> 09:38.369
<i>10-31, 10-31.</i>

<i>Robbery in progress

<i>Witness reports two armed suspects.</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:45.835
<i>One-three King en route.</i>

09:48.129 --> 09:51.340
<i>All units be advised,
witnesses reporting shots fired.</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:52.967
- Out of the way!
- Move!

10:05.271 --> 10:06.272
Shit.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.256
<i>One-three King,Â on scene.</i>

10:22.288 --> 10:23.688
<i>Suspects in custody. No casualties.</i>

10:23.748 --> 10:25.708
- You guys got this?
- Shit.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.391
Yeah, we got it. Let's move.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.961
- Come on.
- Move it.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.255
- <i>Any available unit...</i>
- Watch your head.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.924
<i>...we've got a woman

<i>outside a convenience store

11:16.801 --> 11:18.052
Answer.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.893
<i>Alias Investigations. Leave a message.</i>

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
Jess...

11:42.410 --> 11:43.327
Stop!

11:43.411 --> 11:45.454
Hey! Hey, you! Stop!

11:45.538 --> 11:47.331
He stole my phone!

12:04.140 --> 12:05.057
My head.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.017
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.310
Get off me.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.189
Now that might not be a big deal to you,
but you make people feel powerless.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.650
And that makes you a piece of shit.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.028
- Patsy?
- What? N-No.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.489
Holy shit. It is. It's Patsy.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.490
Not me, asshole.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.701
- I'm not blind.
- This isn't a debate.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.996
My neck. I think you sprained it.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.581
Good. You need to be stopped.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
Screw you. Your show sucked.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.002
That's him! My God. You got him!

12:33.085 --> 12:34.336
He took my phone.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.129
Oh.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.841
Thank God. My whole life is on this thing.
Thank you.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.676
You're welcome.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.721
Patsy?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.287
Hell no.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.895
- Aren't you Trish Walker?
- Not today.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.565
- But you are Trish Walker?
- Yeah. I'm just here to train.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.567
As Trish Walker?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.652
Sure. Jesus.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.655
- Is that a yes?
- Oh, for Chrissake, yes.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.784
I am here training as Trish Walker,
because I am Trish Walker. Okay?

15:11.327 --> 15:12.328
Perfect.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.458
What's this?

15:17.541 --> 15:18.542
You've been served.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.675
God damn it.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.931
It's obnoxious, but it's not illegal.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.223
It's extortion.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.725
The plaintiff's lawyer is a joke.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.644
He probably found him
on the side of a bus,

15:36.727 --> 15:38.562
but his case does have merit.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.107
How does he have a case at all?
I caught him with stolen property.

15:42.191 --> 15:46.153
- You assaulted a stranger.
- A thief. He stole a cell phone.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.696
- Well, was it your phone?
- No.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.133
- Did you actually see him steal the phone?
- I heard yelling.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.285
And then you beat up a man
you saw jogging down the street.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.621
Running. He was trying to get away.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.705
Okay.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.249
The victim,
can he corroborate any of this?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.419
I didn't get his information.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.422
Okay, we can make an argument
for self-defense.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.591
Being a Good Samaritan.
He could've come after you.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.135
I didn't give him the chance.
I'm certified in Krav Maga.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.388
Stop... talking.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.476
Okay, the odds are bad,
but some battles are worth fighting.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.357
I'm surprised that Jessica
never warned you away from me.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.440
She did.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.737
She called you a Prada-wearing python,
but you've earned her respect.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.281
It's hard to come by.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.494
I don't work piecemeal.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.374
If you retain my services, it will be
to represent you in all areas.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.501
I won't need a defense lawyer after this.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.838
Well, you... you could use
an entertainment lawyer.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.466
I'm building a new division
with a very select client list.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.550
You are a celebrity.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.593
Barely.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.846
And first things first.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.768
Is our investigator in the building?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.687
Have him come see me.

17:02.563 --> 17:07.233
Our risk management specialist
will find leverage against the plaintiff.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.902
I suspect you'll have to pay something.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.363
I'll work at getting
that settlement number down.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.156
Ballpark?

17:13.656 --> 17:15.951
The perception is that you
are rich and entitled.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.119
High six figures.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.248
I'm living off my savings.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.625
I can barely afford you.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.046
Take stock of your assets.
Decide what you can liquidate,

17:27.128 --> 17:28.881
or a judge will decide for you.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.383
Come on in.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.100
This is our investigator. I...

17:40.184 --> 17:42.144
I believe you two
know each other, don't you?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.858
Being this guy is a mugger,
he probably lays low.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.027
Might take a little while
to dig up dirt on him.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.362
- You seem comfortable here.
- I am.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.712
The hope is we'll find something
that threatens to put him in jail.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.244
- You're obviously doing well. Armani?
- Zegna.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.913
Long way from an hourly at Alias.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.277
Not far enough. You mind
if we just keep this to business?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.041
Sure.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.544
Shutting me out is popular these days.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.296
And you don't think I have good reason?

18:09.379 --> 18:13.509
Absolutely. I totally screwed up
with you, but...

18:17.554 --> 18:19.223
But I also stopped a killer.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.558
Jessica stopped a killer.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.602
No, she didn't.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.437
It was me.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.648
I pulled the trigger.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.153
You killed Jessica's mother?

18:33.737 --> 18:35.614
A mass murderer, yeah.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.201
Okay.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.286
Yeah, wow.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.330
Well, that's a lot.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.790
You think it was wrong.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.835
Hey, I couldn't live with it,
but clearly it hasn't slowed you down.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.169
Still chasing bad guys.

18:49.253 --> 18:53.132
Who you protect as an investigator
for a defense attorney.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.300
You keep a lot of guilty people
out of jail.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.261
It is not our job to determine guilt.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.554
But you know.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.223
Doesn't it bother you?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.603
Anyone getting away with it who shouldn't?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.856
I'm not doing this with you again, Trish.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.024
- Doing what?
- I know your moves.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.735
You will hurt as many people as you help.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.071
Well, at least I'm trying.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.407
I'm sorry you gave up.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.784
I'm not giving up.
I'm just getting there my own way.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.203
Starting with this job, earning my bones.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.081
You do it your way, but you should
probably keep us on retainer

19:26.165 --> 19:28.625
given that we keep
"guilty people out of jail."

19:29.168 --> 19:30.252
I'll be in touch.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.548
Oh...

19:37.217 --> 19:38.927
Let me get the door for you.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.011
Thanks.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.932
Oh...

19:44.558 --> 19:46.810
My goodness. Let me help you with that.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.042
Dear God.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.501
You scared me.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.047
Well, the door was unlocked.
It doesn't even have a lock.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.673
I got tired of living in a vault.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.717
Well, no wonder
you haven't invited me over.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.260
I've been meaning to.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.305
- Well, it's a hovel.
- It's a semiconverted loft.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.767
Okay, it's not converted,
but it's... it's got great bones.

20:26.850 --> 20:30.103
Yeah. Probably the actual bones
of some homeless junkie.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.522
You have to picture it
with a fresh coat of paint.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.484
You're gonna put a fresh coat
of paint on that view?

20:36.151 --> 20:37.861
Well, it still gets fantastic light.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.657
You really have the knack
of seeing the toilet bowl half full.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.701
The realtor says this area's
gonna be hotter than Williamsburg

20:44.785 --> 20:45.994
after a recession or two.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.330
And you believed her?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.917
Cinder blocks. Jesus.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.171
Oh, good Christ!

20:56.588 --> 20:58.131
Oh, ew!

20:58.215 --> 20:59.675
What is that?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.636
No. You can't live here.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.305
This is not how a Walker
keeps up appearances.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.848
Then I found the right place.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.435
Haven't you lost enough?
Your job. Your fiancÃ©.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.187
And now your gorgeous apartment.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.732
I didn't lose those things, I left them.
Big difference.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.401
Honey, is this about the money?

21:17.484 --> 21:20.028
In part, but the sale of my old apartment
will cover me.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.489
It'll cover a lot more than this dump.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.200
I have other expenses.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.369
Should I be worried?

21:27.452 --> 21:29.788
That I'm simplifying my life? No.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.458
There is a difference
between simple and bleak.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.627
Something is going on with you.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.047
Just let me help you, Pats.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.176
Okay.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.556
- You can start in the bathroom.
- What?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.683
That toilet's not gonna scrub itself.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.644
- Oh, this isn't funny.
- Well, you said you wanted to help.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.106
Would you rather start in the kitchen?
Because the oven is a disaster.

21:56.940 --> 22:03.864
Sweetheart, whatever it is you are trying
to accomplish, you cannot do it alone.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.369
I know, Mom.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.664
Well, it has been a while,

22:12.748 --> 22:19.046
but I can still scrub off grime
like nobody's business.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.256
You're relentless.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.718
Pot, kettle, black, baby girl.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.056
God damn. Broke a nail.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.608
<i>I've envied your powers,
but never the P.I. stuff.</i>

22:40.400 --> 22:44.738
<i>Stalking out suspects for weeks on end?
Like watching paint dry.</i>

22:45.781 --> 22:51.703
<i>Probably why you like it... being alone,
keeping people at a distance,</i>

22:52.829 --> 22:56.541
<i>focusing on someone else's shit
so you don't have to look at your own.</i>

23:02.172 --> 23:03.548
What are you doing?

23:07.552 --> 23:08.553
Jesus.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.223
Jesus. Uh...

23:11.932 --> 23:12.933
Okay.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.103
Don't drink that.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.730
Shit. Shit. Shit.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.483
Uh... The plan.
What's the plan?

23:22.025 --> 23:23.443
Damn it.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.247
<i>Alias Investigations. Leave a message.</i>

23:59.146 --> 24:00.730
Am I sick?

24:00.814 --> 24:02.649
You're gonna be fine, Birdie. Hey.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.110
You just need some rest, all right?

24:05.944 --> 24:06.945
Here.

24:10.365 --> 24:11.950
I was... I...

24:18.415 --> 24:19.415
You okay?

24:20.834 --> 24:24.296
- Am I still Birdie?
- Yeah, that's you, babe.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.048
Uh, I'm cold.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.259
We'll keep each other warm.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.016
No. No.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.602
Stop. No.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.653
Not this time, asshole.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.701
Hey. Wake up.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.953
Hey, stay with me.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.916
You have to focus.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.709
I'm gonna ralph.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.795
You've been drugged, but you're okay.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.091
Just give me a heads-up
if you're actually gonna ralph.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.178
Uh... who are you?

25:13.261 --> 25:16.681
I'm here to help. I will stay with you
until the police get here.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.476
Why? What... What happened?

25:20.268 --> 25:22.604
Your friend Reid
put something in your drink

25:22.687 --> 25:25.065
and brought you here to rape you.

25:26.983 --> 25:30.612
He's done it before,
but got off on a technicality.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.323
Rich parents. Fancy lawyer.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.705
It was a matter of time
before he did it again.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.869
- Oh, my God.
- Listen to me.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.414
Your friends saw you two
together earlier tonight.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.627
They saw you flirting with each other,
and they saw you leave together.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.797
All of which made Reid think
he could get away with it, but...

25:49.839 --> 25:51.049
he won't.

25:51.132 --> 25:54.177
- Wait. Oh, God. Did he...
- No. No.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.723
Because you fought him off.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.228
- What?
- Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.648
- I fought him off?
- Yes.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.318
You have to make sure
the police give you a tox screen.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.028
Asshole!

26:29.838 --> 26:30.880
You're welcome.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.595
<i>How many wins will it take
to redeem myself with you?</i>

26:38.847 --> 26:39.848
<i>Ten?</i>

26:40.473 --> 26:41.516
<i>A hundred?</i>

26:42.767 --> 26:44.144
<i>Let's start with one.</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:55.864
- Hey.
- You busy?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.492
I'm a half a bottle into my work.
What's up?

27:00.327 --> 27:01.995
Well, you left this at my place.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.207
You could've sent Vido down with it.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.420
But you have something else on your mind.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.048
Do you ever stop thinking
like a P.I.?

27:13.131 --> 27:16.676
That's why I hate magic.
I always figured out the trick. Also...

27:17.594 --> 27:18.594
magicians.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.430
No, magicians are awful.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.183
So?

27:24.684 --> 27:26.811
I wanted to talk to you
about our friendship.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.690
- I mean, that's what it is now, right?
- I guess so.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.151
I'm not sure what happened.

27:34.986 --> 27:35.987
You're a good guy.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.865
That's what happened.

27:38.948 --> 27:42.077
Well, you must be
doing something right, because

27:42.160 --> 27:43.662
Vido loves the shit out of you.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.457
You know I'm only friends with you
to be friends with him, right?

27:47.540 --> 27:48.625
I'll take it.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.714
Well... I just wanted to get that out
in the open before I moved on.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.592
You met someone?

27:59.177 --> 28:00.553
I thought you should know,

28:00.637 --> 28:03.306
in case we run into each other
in the elevator or something.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.809
It's all good.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.730
That's nice, having someone you can let in
that lets you in, too.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.195
Yeah, that is the one trick
I never quite figured out.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.825
How to let someone in
without it ending badly.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.869
- It's worth a try.
- Not if they end up dead.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.598
Jess, your mother loved
every minute with you.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.082
I could see that on her face.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.251
I think you're kind of proving my point.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.839
You don't think
she wanted that time?

28:35.922 --> 28:37.549
Even if she knew how it was gonna end?

28:37.632 --> 28:39.634
Can we just not talk about it?
Okay?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.718
Okay.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.557
Mm-hmm. Come on, you got this.
Five more seconds.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.892
Yeah.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.063
All right. Got it. Good job.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.898
Hey, easy. Take a break.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.026
Trish, slow the hell down.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.113
- Okay, ready?
- Got more?

29:20.508 --> 29:21.843
Take it off. I'll wash it.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.721
Do you even have a washing machine?

29:28.516 --> 29:29.517
Take it off.

29:51.539 --> 29:55.126
<i>...in the evening with skies
remaining cloudy, but dry overnight.</i>

29:55.210 --> 29:58.797
<i>Expected temperatures to remain
below freezing into next week,</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:00.924
<i>- when we should finally see...
- </i> You're still here.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.134
I made some coffee.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.806
Yeah. Listen, Adrian, I, uh...
I have a lot of work. Um... It's...

30:07.889 --> 30:10.767
<i>...brutal attack this morning.
Madeline Brandt was asleep</i>

30:10.850 --> 30:13.019
<i>when intruders broke in and assaulted her,</i>

30:13.102 --> 30:14.813
<i>stealing a valuable sculpture.</i>

30:15.313 --> 30:18.942
<i>Police have arrested
Ms. Brandt's half-brother, Andrew Brandt.</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:20.735
You hear about this piece of shit?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.571
Hired a couple thugs
to beat the crap out of his half-sister.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.656
Why?

30:24.739 --> 30:26.574
She inherited the one thing he wanted.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.661
He got everything else,
but not this stupid sculpture.

30:29.744 --> 30:33.289
<i>...remains in critical
condition at Metro-General Hospital...</i>

30:33.373 --> 30:37.085
See, that's why I box,
so I can molly whop assholes like him.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.089
- "Molly whop"?
- It's a saying.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.970
- Who is it?
- It's me.

30:47.554 --> 30:52.058
Oh, crap. Uh... Yeah,
I have an appointment I forgot.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.102
Yeah.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.604
Um... workout Thursday?

30:57.146 --> 30:58.398
You know, I'll call you.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.610
Sleep with the client, lose the client.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.706
Colorful neighborhood.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.667
I wanted a change.

31:18.334 --> 31:21.170
I just came here to get a check off you
for the cell phone thief.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.007
So he gets paid? What happens next?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.843
It's over.

31:26.926 --> 31:31.681
Steal what you can, sue for the rest.
Gotta love American justice.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.517
- How much?
- Fifty grand.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.813
That's a lot less than Hogarth expected.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.024
I got him to back down.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.235
You must have found some significant dirt.
What was it?

31:44.319 --> 31:46.195
No. I don't have time to get into that.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.907
- What did you find?
- Does it matter?

31:48.990 --> 31:51.576
It's my case.
I want to know how bad the guy is.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.663
He's got a rap sheet
going back to high school.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.833
Assault, robbery, DUI.
Served his time, so that wasn't useful.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.503
However, he is a family guy.
Married, 12-year-old boy.

32:02.587 --> 32:03.671
And that's useful?

32:04.339 --> 32:06.799
Not on the surface,
but the kid worships him.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.968
He doesn't give a shit
that his dad's an ex-con.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.972
He's still a hero. So I dug deeper, and...

32:14.682 --> 32:18.519
it turns out Mom and Dad have been
lying to the kid for his whole life.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.064
He's not this kid's dad at all. Just...

32:22.148 --> 32:25.526
some guy who came into the picture
when the kid was a baby.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.571
He fell in love with the boy
and raised him as his own. So...

32:29.948 --> 32:31.491
I gave him a simple choice.

32:32.408 --> 32:36.788
I could enlighten his son, or he could
reconsider his settlement demands.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.541
He thought I was bluffing.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.379
Till I pulled up the kid's
cell phone number, called him.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.507
I asked...

32:50.677 --> 32:53.930
I asked the kid if his dad had ever...

32:54.847 --> 32:56.140
told him what a bastard is.

32:59.519 --> 33:03.356
Desperation in his dad's eyes.
Crying, begging me to hang up.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.819
And all I thought...

33:09.779 --> 33:10.822
was, "I got you."

33:16.452 --> 33:19.706
And what would you have done
if he refused to negotiate?

33:21.374 --> 33:23.001
I would've told the kid everything.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.924
I got the job done.
It's what it takes.

33:30.466 --> 33:31.718
To earn a paycheck?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.178
Prove myself to Hogarth.

33:40.893 --> 33:44.605
Never do anything like that
on my behalf again. Ever.

33:45.690 --> 33:49.360
Don't you look at me like I'm the one
going off the goddamn rails, all right?

33:49.444 --> 33:52.071
- You're not fooling anyone.
- I'm working on a project.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.449
I know what your screwed-up idea
of a project is.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.367
I don't owe you an explanation.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.870
Tell that to TMZ when they ask,
"Where's Patsy now?"

33:58.953 --> 34:00.329
- They're not asking.
- They will.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.959
And you better find a good answer
to that question, 'cause right now...

34:05.877 --> 34:08.004
you look one meltdown away
from a psych ward.

34:21.016 --> 34:26.230
The thing I love most about this cardigan
is how it feels against your skin.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.065
You know, it's light but warm.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.152
The perfect outerwear
for this cuckoo spring weather.

34:31.235 --> 34:35.864
And, you know, the wonderful thing
about it is it's machine wash, tumble dry.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.159
Mmm!

34:38.242 --> 34:41.704
Now, I've spent the past year
perfecting a cotton blend

34:41.788 --> 34:44.540
in colors that are timeless yet versatile.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.458
This cardie is my new BFF.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.504
Now, Sasha here
is wearing the Island Breeze.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.380
Oh, that color just pops on her.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.760
I mean, it just turns your basics
into, like, a chic, fun outfit.

34:55.842 --> 34:59.305
It's like her outfit got a promotion.
Gorgeous, Sasha.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.642
Now, we have Hannah on the line
from Ann Arbor. Hi, Hannah.

35:02.725 --> 35:06.187
<i>Hi, Trish. Oh, my God.
It's so wonderful to talk to you.</i>

35:06.270 --> 35:07.647
Are you enjoying our knits?

35:07.730 --> 35:10.358
<i>Definitely. I got one for my sister
and one for my mom,</i>

35:10.441 --> 35:11.984
<i>and they both love it.</i>

35:12.068 --> 35:13.361
Don't forget about yourself.

35:14.487 --> 35:18.241
<i>Oh, I'm not getting out a lot these days.
I'm recently divorced.</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:22.411
She can handle it.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.542
I'm so sorry to hear that, Hannah,

35:27.625 --> 35:32.088
but the end of a relationship
doesn't make you any less worthy

35:32.171 --> 35:34.799
of feeling beautiful and fulfilled.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.677
Spring is about new beginnings.

35:39.053 --> 35:42.306
So show your ex
what a good thing he's missing.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.100
<i>You're so right.</i>

35:44.183 --> 35:47.478
<i>- Is it still available in Bordeaux?</i>
- That's my favorite color.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.688
<i>Thank you so much, Trish.</i>

35:49.939 --> 35:50.982
You're welcome.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.733
- Off air!
- God!

35:52.817 --> 35:56.070
This is so much better
than hawking the ShowerBuddy.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.907
Don't ask. You're killing it, girl.
If we keep selling at this rate,

35:59.991 --> 36:02.076
they'll move us out
of this lousy time slot.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.288
Oh, I asked for this time slot.
Works with my schedule.

36:11.794 --> 36:15.506
"The case of the stolen sculpture"?
It's like bad reality TV.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.467
They putting that guy in jail?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.636
They're dropping the charges
against Brandt.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.971
You've gotta be kidding me.

36:22.054 --> 36:25.099
They couldn't find the sculpture
to link him to his sister's attack.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.894
Meanwhile, she's drinking
her meals through a straw.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.563
Makes you want to strangle
someone with a sweater.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.191
- Wouldn't help her.
- It'd help me.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.277
Someone ought to call
that superhero woman. Jennifer something.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.863
Jessica.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.078
Grace, you might want to
talk to the wardrobe gal.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.414
I swear I saw a nipple
through that blouse.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.462
Keep your head in the game, baby.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.880
That's not vitaminwater.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.590
This is fine.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.093
They can't expect you to keep these hours

37:01.177 --> 37:03.387
and not provide something
to keep your energy up.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.471
I'm wide awake.

37:04.513 --> 37:07.516
You have another hour to go, honey.
And where are your Skittles?

37:07.600 --> 37:10.144
This was all spelled out in your contract.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.230
- I don't even like Skittles.
- I do.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.489
You're happy here, aren't you?

37:22.615 --> 37:23.950
It's serving a purpose.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.744
If you flame out again,

37:27.995 --> 37:29.413
there won't be another gig.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.249
Nobody will want you.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.794
I'm keeping this job.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.588
People need to see what I'm up to.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.634
Good.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.888
Ms. Walker, we need you to look at some
options for tomorrow's deal of the day.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.516
- Yeah. Mom, can you...
- Of course.

37:49.517 --> 37:53.646
Okay, sequins are totally
off-brand. What else have you got?

37:53.729 --> 37:56.941
Oh, dear. Okay, let's go
look at the main closet.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.094
<i>A team-up isn't your style.</i>

38:26.304 --> 38:28.097
<i>But you've never tried it with me.</i>

38:30.099 --> 38:32.601
<i>And I have a real monster in my sights.</i>

38:33.561 --> 38:35.021
<i>I could use your help.</i>

38:47.867 --> 38:49.910
<i>You don't have to do this alone anymore.</i>

38:50.494 --> 38:51.746
<i>Neither of us do.</i>

38:52.913 --> 38:54.290
<i>It's time, Jess.</i>

38:55.583 --> 38:59.670
<i>There are too many horrors hiding
in the dark, but I see them clearly now.</i>

39:03.841 --> 39:05.593
<i>I'm missing a piece without you.</i>

39:06.594 --> 39:08.679
<i>Maybe you feel the same about me...</i>

39:09.930 --> 39:11.557
<i>or about your mother.</i>

39:13.601 --> 39:15.728
<i>Maybe I was wrong.</i>

39:31.410 --> 39:34.121
<i>You needed a moral compass. I was it.</i>

39:34.205 --> 39:39.085
<i>Now you're too busy blaming me to admit
that your mother had to be stopped.</i>

39:40.211 --> 39:42.296
<i>You couldn't separate good from bad.</i>

43:43.704 --> 43:45.414
You boring piece of shit.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.265
Oh, shit.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.112
Don't forget your breath mint.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.952
Probably have halitosis.

44:36.382 --> 44:37.508
About time.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.972
Come on, show me.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.808
I know it's in there.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.737
Move, asshole!

45:14.420 --> 45:16.004
Where are you taking it?

45:16.088 --> 45:17.089
Shit.

45:17.381 --> 45:18.381
Uh...

47:00.484 --> 47:03.737
Come on, come on, come on.
You guys gonna hug or fight?

47:09.243 --> 47:12.037
Give him the left. Give him the left.
Give him the left.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.205
Take him down.

47:14.665 --> 47:15.833
No, idiot.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.292
<i>Sizing him up.</i>

47:17.835 --> 47:20.629
<i>Oh, nice! Nice land there by Gonzalez.</i>

47:20.712 --> 47:22.256
<i>Caught him flush on the chin.</i>

47:24.758 --> 47:25.926
What the hell?

47:28.637 --> 47:29.763
Who the hell are you?

47:30.722 --> 47:33.433
Right now, your sister's best friend.

47:33.517 --> 47:36.278
- Get your nutjob ass out of here.
- Your turn to be the helpless one.

47:55.247 --> 47:58.667
I've been tracking him for weeks,
and now he's gone.

47:58.750 --> 48:02.254
Maybe it is better
if you just stay out of the way.

48:02.754 --> 48:04.590
Why? Because you're a hero now?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.010
Yes.

48:08.385 --> 48:14.016
The world's moral compass,
who knows good from bad?

48:15.559 --> 48:16.560
Maybe.

48:17.227 --> 48:20.731
And now I'm finally equipped
to do something about it.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.482
Then it was worth it, then.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.027
What you did to me.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.905
Because you got what you wanted.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.617
You don't get it, Jess. You're free.

48:32.618 --> 48:36.163
You always said you didn't ask for this.
But I did.

48:37.205 --> 48:41.335
So you can stop trying and...
and feeling guilty and inadequate.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.378
I don't need you to be a hero.

48:44.129 --> 48:45.297
Nobody does.

48:47.382 --> 48:48.675
I've got it covered.

48:51.219 --> 48:55.474
Your mother's looking for you.
Call her so I can get paid.

49:11.531 --> 49:12.741
Oh, Pats!

49:13.659 --> 49:16.995
I tried to see you before the show,
but that merchandise meeting just...

49:17.537 --> 49:18.580
But it's okay.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.249
Where on earth were you?

49:21.333 --> 49:23.460
I was worried sick,
and Jessica wouldn't tell me.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.504
Uh... I had to take care of something.

49:26.171 --> 49:28.298
You missed two shows in a row.

49:29.383 --> 49:32.302
I told the network you had a bug.
They didn't buy it.

49:33.345 --> 49:36.431
But I reminded them how lucky they are
to have someone of your caliber.

49:37.849 --> 49:39.017
Thanks, Mom.

49:39.893 --> 49:42.062
But you're out of second chances, baby.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.733
I know. It won't happen again.

49:46.817 --> 49:51.822
Poor... What was it? You can talk to me.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.491
Are you drinking?
Did you fall off the wagon?

49:54.574 --> 49:55.826
No.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.244
Is it a man?

49:58.787 --> 50:00.872
Talk to me, sweetie. I'm your mommy.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.294
I'm all alone.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.633
I'm all alone in this.

50:12.592 --> 50:14.052
Oh, sweetheart.

50:15.262 --> 50:16.930
I know how you feel.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.393
It's the girl's burden.

50:21.977 --> 50:25.605
And no matter who he is,
he does not deserve you.

50:28.775 --> 50:29.776
Baby.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.070
You're gonna get through this.

50:32.821 --> 50:34.322
You always do.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.618
I'm gonna go get you a tissue.
We're gonna get you all fixed up.

50:53.759 --> 50:54.760
Malcolm?

50:55.385 --> 50:58.013
<i>Jessica's in the hospital.
She asked for you.</i>

51:19.242 --> 51:20.577
How are you feeling?

51:27.459 --> 51:28.627
I need a name.

51:29.461 --> 51:30.796
You need rest.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.048
You just had surgery.

51:34.758 --> 51:38.136
Doctor says, uh, you'll be here
for a few days, so, uh...

51:39.513 --> 51:41.473
I picked up some things.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.102
I'm sorry this has happened to you.

51:46.686 --> 51:51.233
But whoever did this,
we will find them and get them locked up.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.319
I just want a name.

51:55.153 --> 51:56.196
Whose name?

51:58.740 --> 51:59.740
Brandt?

52:01.409 --> 52:02.911
You think he did this?

52:05.038 --> 52:06.038
I mean...

52:06.331 --> 52:09.084
makes sense. He recognized you.

52:09.167 --> 52:12.420
If it wasn't him, it...
it might've been one of his thugs.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.172
His full name.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.512
Andrew Brandt.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.181
Thanks.

52:47.539 --> 52:48.540
You're welcome.

53:57.275 --> 53:58.275
<i>I got it.</i>
