01:37.298 --> 01:39.700
Where's my crucifix?

01:39.733 --> 01:40.868
[chuckles]

01:40.901 --> 01:42.770
Sorry I didn't
come to bed last night.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.773
I wanted to get it done
before we left.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.342
Did you?

01:53.347 --> 01:56.217
Till the re-write.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.552
Wow.

01:58.586 --> 02:02.490
Which means that
for the next week,

02:02.523 --> 02:03.791
I'm all yours.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.293
[chuckling]

02:05.326 --> 02:07.328
Wait a second...

02:07.361 --> 02:08.372
I don't hear any screaming.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.431
Why don't I hear any screaming?

02:10.464 --> 02:14.235
Our son decided he needs
some extra beauty sleep,

02:14.268 --> 02:17.137
and Jane is training
for the next moon landing.

02:22.243 --> 02:25.613
[sighs]
Greta is great.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.646
She is?

02:27.715 --> 02:28.849
Come on, look at them.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.518
Jane's crazy about her.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.387
I mean, who wouldn't like her?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.223
She's so...

02:35.256 --> 02:37.525
so blonde.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.860
Is that jealousy
I hear in your voice?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.230
[laughs] It's just
an observation,

02:42.263 --> 02:43.697
Mr. "Let's get a nanny

02:43.731 --> 02:46.534
because all my successful
friends have one."

02:46.567 --> 02:48.336
That reminds me,

02:48.369 --> 02:50.471
Lyle's coming by
to look at the furnace.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.306
Oh, Lyle again.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.209
Can we get an authorized
repair person for once?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.310
You're the one

02:56.344 --> 02:57.624
who's obsessed
with saving money.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.880
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.913
Mm-hmm.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.763
You are one great
astronaut, you know that?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.465
Thanks, Greta!

03:17.498 --> 03:18.499
Aw...

03:20.268 --> 03:23.637
[♪♪]

03:38.586 --> 03:39.920
Hey.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.789
Thanks for coming.

03:41.822 --> 03:46.026
It's, uh, furnace
problems again?

03:46.059 --> 03:49.730
Yeah, I think it might
be a gas supply.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.332
Here's a key.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.466
Take a look,

03:52.500 --> 03:53.667
let me know what you think.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.403
Yeah, sure thing.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.439
I'll, uh, send you an estimate.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.707
Great.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.841
We'll be back Sunday.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.443
Sunday.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.644
All right.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.963
[man]: This one's gonna be
a bestseller, I can feel it.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.055
You're gonna be
the next Stephen King.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.826
[laughs]

04:18.858 --> 04:21.495
Just... don't let it
out of your sight, okay?

04:21.529 --> 04:23.063
If it gets into the wrong hands,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.898
my publisher will...

04:24.932 --> 04:26.367
Well, to use
a five-dollar word,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.701
she'll be very vexed.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.571
Madam, you are impugning
my professional discretion.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.705
Never.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.375
You know how much I appreciate
your feedback, Teddy.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.543
The pleasure's all mine.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.478
You're the last decent writer
I ever taught.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.846
I swear,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.824
half my students should be
sent back to remedial English.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.450
[laughing]

04:42.483 --> 04:44.352
Hi, Ted.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.753
Hey, Mark.
How's the startup game?

04:45.786 --> 04:46.787
Can't complain.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.522
Managing a couple
of hedge funds.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.658
I got some
big investors on the line.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.035
That's what this trip
is all about,

04:52.059 --> 04:53.427
reelin' 'em in.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.828
Oh, sounds promising.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.029
Tell me,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.433
has this protégée of mine
made any new friends out there,

04:59.467 --> 05:01.569
or is she still the same
sad loner you married?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.103
Hey, I resent that remark.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.372
All right.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.706
Enough with the jokes,

05:05.739 --> 05:06.640
you guys better get going.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.676
You heard the man.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.511
All right, bye, Teddy.
Thanks again.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.779
You're welcome.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.648
I'll toast your success
with a virgin Bloody Mary.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.617
Make sure that wagon
doesn't tip.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.586
Said the preacher to the choir.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.020
- Have a nice trip.
- Bye.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.132
Okay, you need to call Brenda.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.358
Uh-huh.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.559
And did you make sure

05:25.593 --> 05:26.770
that the kids got
all their stuff?

05:26.794 --> 05:28.061
Of course.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.419
Need a hand?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.953
I'm good.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.489
I finally get to be
a full-time mom again.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.057
My little guy
is going to love that.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.090
Huh? Yeah.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.899
[neighbor calling]
Is that your wife I see?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.000
[chuckles]

06:07.034 --> 06:08.135
Yes.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.671
Hell has officially frozen over.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.539
Thank you so much

06:11.572 --> 06:13.073
for looking after
the house for us.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.408
No problem.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.043
I hope a week away
is good for you two.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.745
Well, I get to decompress,

06:17.778 --> 06:19.112
and Mark gets to schmooze

06:19.146 --> 06:21.124
with some of the biggest
players in venture capital,

06:21.148 --> 06:22.983
so should be a win-win.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.753
Mommy, what's venture capital?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.555
Money, Janie.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.491
Money makes the world go around.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.726
I thought love made
the world go around.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.727
It does, honey.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.795
It does.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.196
Let's get you in the car, okay?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.498
- Okay.
- Break a leg.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.542
Thank you so much, Brenda.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.833
Bye!

06:43.170 --> 06:44.170
Drive safe.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.416
[♪♪]

07:25.078 --> 07:28.015
There must be a mistake.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.151
I was told parking was included.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.152
Did you book using our website?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.522
Actually, it was through
your reservation agent.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.599
Let me check with our manager.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.824
Sorry for the inconvenience.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
You should be.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.270
Maybe you should
take the kids upstairs,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.563
and I'll sort this out.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.564
Yeah, good idea.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.565
[baby crying]

07:44.598 --> 07:45.666
You need a hand?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.176
No, we're good,
I'll see you up there.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.536
Come on, Jane.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.782
[baby crying]

08:01.815 --> 08:02.916
Shh, shh, shh...

08:02.950 --> 08:03.917
It's okay, it's okay...

08:03.951 --> 08:05.185
Shh, shh, shh...

08:05.218 --> 08:07.020
Shh, shh, shh...

08:09.857 --> 08:11.692
Hungry little guy, huh?

08:11.725 --> 08:12.726
Yeah.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.861
Hungry and tired.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.928
Aw, long car trip?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.129
Yeah.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.698
Oh, they're the worst.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.634
Here, let me try something.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.046
[in silly voice]
Please don't cry!

08:23.070 --> 08:24.972
I do not want you
to cry anymore!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.607
[in villainous voice]
Yes! Please do cry!

08:26.640 --> 08:28.308
Your tears make me stronger.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.553
[voices arguing]
No, they do not, you stop it!

08:29.577 --> 08:31.779
- No, you stop it.
- No, you do!

08:31.812 --> 08:33.714
[chuckles]
That's impressive.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.782
You must have kids.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.650
Just a niece and a nephew, yeah.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.654
Well, I bet they like
having such a cool uncle.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.989
Thanks.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.190
What's your name?

08:43.222 --> 08:44.692
I'm Oscar.
What's your name?

08:44.725 --> 08:45.759
Jane.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.795
But my friends call me Janie.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.905
Well, I would like
to be your friend.

08:48.929 --> 08:49.930
Would you like that?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.131
Can I, Mommy?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.633
Of course, honey.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.301
Okay.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.803
[chuckling]

08:56.904 --> 08:58.772
I'm Nomi Gardner.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.173
Nomi? Wait...

09:00.207 --> 09:02.009
that wouldn't be Nomi Gardner

09:02.042 --> 09:03.176
the crime writer, would it?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.912
Actually, yeah.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
[chuckles]

09:06.647 --> 09:08.849
A pleasure.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
You've heard of Nomi?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.019
Oh, absolutely.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.822
I'm reading her latest book,
Shattered, right now.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.890
Well, that makes my day.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.125
Yeah, great.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.127
Uh, could you please
take these, Oscar?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.228
Yes, sir, right away.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.596
Thank you.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.563
Where's 303?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.274
Uh, right down here,
and on your right, sir.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.834
I'll take your bags
and follow you.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.901
Brilliant.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.676
Excellent work.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.944
I like it.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.011
You should go show Daddy.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.783
Janie...

09:42.816 --> 09:43.884
Daddy's working.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.987
But we colored these for you.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.622
Wow.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.958
That is really good.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.360
You are a talented artist.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.295
You too, Greta.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.731
Thank you.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.166
Greta, where's the formula?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.168
It should be in the change bag.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.103
Well, it's not,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.313
and neither are the baby wipes.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.372
Oh, no.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.140
I am so sorry, Nomi,

10:07.174 --> 10:09.276
I can't believe
that I forgot both.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.111
No problem.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.313
I think there's
a drugstore nearby.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.247
Okay, I'll go.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.182
No, it's okay.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.249
Are you sure?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.785
'Cause I'm the one
that screwed up.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.086
Relax.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.053
Nobody's perfect.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.087
[chuckles warmly]

10:23.290 --> 10:24.291
Bye, Mommy!

10:24.324 --> 10:25.325
Bye, honey.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.727
Be good,

10:26.760 --> 10:27.661
I'll be back in a minute.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.695
Okay.

Ma'am, can I help you?

13:45.525 --> 13:46.994
Yes, you can call the police.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.028
The police?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.029
Is something wrong?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.363
You could say that.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.366
I'm afraid
the Gardners aren't here.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.935
What?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.004
I said, the Gardners are out.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.405
I don't have time for this.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.438
Miss!

14:01.041 --> 14:02.041
Mark!

14:03.043 --> 14:04.144
Jane!

14:04.177 --> 14:05.488
Miss March,
you cannot go in there!

14:05.512 --> 14:07.114
That's not my name!

14:07.147 --> 14:08.548
You wanted the police? Fine.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.283
Let's go back downstairs
and call them.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.953
I just want to find out
where my family is!

14:12.986 --> 14:14.354
As I've told you twice before,

14:14.387 --> 14:15.387
the Gardners are out.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.225
Where?

14:19.459 --> 14:20.894
At the convention,

14:20.928 --> 14:22.262
and they made it
very clear to me

14:22.295 --> 14:23.506
that after the incident
last night,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.498
your services are
no longer required.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.567
What are you talking about?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.402
What incident?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.412
Mark?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.082
Greta?

15:17.484 --> 15:18.618
What are you doing here?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.453
That's not funny,

15:20.487 --> 15:22.022
and I could ask you
the same question.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.392
I have nothing to say to you.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.195
Damn it, Mark, somebody
just tried to kill me.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.331
Where are the kids?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.667
You touch me again,
I'll call the police.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.736
Mark...

15:36.769 --> 15:38.571
please, just tell me
what's going on.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.572
Where are Jane and Aiden?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.707
They're fine.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.376
Their new nanny is
looking after them.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.712
You...

15:45.745 --> 15:47.447
Look, I don't know

15:47.480 --> 15:48.557
what you think
you're doing here,

15:48.581 --> 15:51.084
but I thought I made it
very clear to you last night

15:51.118 --> 15:54.387
that I never want you coming
near my family again.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.455
Your family?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.499
So, are you going to leave,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.323
or do I have to get
Security to throw you out?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.062
Is this some kind of joke?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.064
Some kind of sick prank
or something?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.441
What... If you think I'm going
to go along with this,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.533
then you're insane.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.534
I could have died.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.535
Boys?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.712
This is the woman who
assaulted me last night.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.438
No, no... No!

16:11.471 --> 16:13.206
I can prove I'm Nomi Gardner!

16:13.240 --> 16:14.107
[scoffs] Really?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.284
And just how are you
going to do that?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.409
I'm Nomi Gardner.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.763
My wallet.
My I.D.'s in my wallet.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.656
Are we all on the same page now?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.195
Good.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.429
This is impossible.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.131
No...

16:38.165 --> 16:39.566
Mark?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.034
Mark, say something!

16:41.068 --> 16:42.068
Mark!

16:43.203 --> 16:44.203
Say something!

16:46.606 --> 16:48.041
Mark!

16:49.376 --> 16:51.344
It's...

16:51.378 --> 16:54.714
identity theft.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.616
I don't know
what else to call it.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.521
[Detective]: There must be
family that can vouch for you.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.223
[Nomi]: I'm an only child.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.659
My parents died years ago.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.328
[Detective]:
And your close friends?

17:10.262 --> 17:13.066
I'm not very social.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.335
I hate crowds.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.328
Since we moved here,
I've literally been a hermit.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.375
[Detective]: And you've had
no interactions

17:22.409 --> 17:24.310
with anyone
in your neighborhood?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.213
[Nomi]: The nanny...

17:26.246 --> 17:29.682
we hired her
when we moved to Olympia.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.451
She takes Jane to kindergarten.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.522
She gets the groceries...

17:35.555 --> 17:38.191
She does everything.

17:38.225 --> 17:42.229
I want to press
charges, Officer.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.464
Do you know anything about this?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.598
Um...

17:47.567 --> 17:50.237
"They can both rot in hell"?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.704
"I just wish
I could be in the room

17:51.738 --> 17:53.406
when their kids
find out I'm dead?"

17:53.440 --> 17:55.275
That was the last post.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.709
Yesterday
at 11:00 p.m.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.577
I'd say whoever wrote that

17:57.610 --> 18:00.347
made their intentions
pretty clear.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.581
It wasn't me.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.782
I don't use social media.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.384
Greta March does.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.219
I'm not Greta March.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.487
Well, then we have a problem,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.190
because everything
I've been able to access

18:10.223 --> 18:11.258
says otherwise.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.368
They must have hacked
my accounts.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.426
Every website?

18:13.460 --> 18:14.827
Every photograph?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.863
Well, it wouldn't be that hard.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.400
I have almost nothing
of me online.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.834
I...

18:21.868 --> 18:23.670
just find this all
very hard to believe.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.573
Mark,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.541
my husband,

18:28.575 --> 18:31.378
he has been involved
in a bunch of tech start-ups.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.746
He knows a lot of people
in the computer industry,

18:33.780 --> 18:36.383
smart people

18:36.416 --> 18:38.718
that he must have
hired to do this.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.420
[sighs wearily]

18:40.453 --> 18:43.656
Okay, I'm just being
devil's advocate here, okay?

18:43.690 --> 18:44.800
Can I get you
something to drink?

18:44.824 --> 18:45.758
Yeah.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.792
Okay.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.262
Oh, God.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.331
I gotta ask...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.469
you know how crazy
this sounds, right?

18:56.503 --> 18:57.503
Uh-huh.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.408
What's his motive?

19:01.441 --> 19:02.575
What does he stand to gain

19:02.609 --> 19:05.245
by going to all this trouble
to switch your identities?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.379
I don't know.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.391
Unless there's money involved.
Is there money involved?

19:08.415 --> 19:10.350
My books have barely sold enough

19:10.383 --> 19:11.618
to cover the advance.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.785
What about him?

19:12.819 --> 19:15.555
What does he stand to lose?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.190
Nothing.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.826
His last three companies
have crashed and burned.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.294
We only moved to Olympia

19:21.328 --> 19:23.330
because Boston was getting
too expensive,

19:23.363 --> 19:25.932
and I kept telling him
not to get a nanny,

19:25.965 --> 19:26.933
because we can't afford it,

19:26.966 --> 19:28.568
and he insisted.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.373
Now I know why.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.576
Look, all I can do right now
is file a report,

19:36.609 --> 19:39.279
but if it turns out to be false,

19:39.312 --> 19:41.214
you could be charged
with a felony.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.516
Are you absolutely sure
you want to do this?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.452
Yes.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.753
Please.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.221
Okay.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.689
I'll be right back.

20:02.969 --> 20:03.936
Detective Krantz?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.505
My name's Donovan Harris.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.915
I know who you are, Counselor.
What can I do for you?

20:06.939 --> 20:09.008
I've been retained
by Mark and Nomi Gardner.

20:09.041 --> 20:09.942
This is a restraining order

20:09.976 --> 20:12.412
against a former employee
of the family.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.514
Let me guess, Greta March?

20:16.816 --> 20:19.586
My clients have employed
Miss March as a nanny

20:19.619 --> 20:20.987
for the past six months,

20:21.020 --> 20:22.489
however, recently,

20:22.522 --> 20:23.323
they've become concerned

20:23.356 --> 20:26.459
with a decline
in her performance.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.936
The assault on
Mrs. Gardner last night

20:27.960 --> 20:29.729
was the final straw.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.531
Now, they believe
that Greta here

20:31.564 --> 20:34.734
is clearly a danger
to herself and to others.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.778
Now, they won't press charges

20:35.802 --> 20:36.803
if they don't have to,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.005
but they do not want
an unhinged,

20:39.038 --> 20:40.873
and possibly suicidal woman

20:40.907 --> 20:41.841
anywhere near their children

20:41.874 --> 20:43.576
ever again.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.811
A DNA test.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.646
Excuse me?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.615
That'll prove the kids are mine.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.518
I'm sorry, which part
of "ever again"

20:51.551 --> 20:53.720
was unclear to you, Miss March?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.893
I still want to file
that report, Detective.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.831
Are you listening to me?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.701
This is the name
of a good therapist.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.069
Call her.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.182
She'll be able to help you.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.577
If you won't do your job,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.455
then I'll find someone else
around here who will.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.723
Unless you want
to end up in jail,

21:20.747 --> 21:24.451
I suggest that you go home now
and get your head on straight.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.453
And for your own good,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.421
stay far, far away
from the Gardners.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.925
[scoffs in disbelief]

21:34.627 --> 21:35.627
[laughs ruefully]

21:51.444 --> 21:52.745
Come on, come on, pick up.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.917
[cell phone rings]

21:57.950 --> 21:58.951
Hello?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.487
Ted.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.621
Nomi, hey.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.722
I'm still reading,

22:02.755 --> 22:03.523
but listen,
so far, I've gotta say,

22:03.556 --> 22:05.658
you're knocking it
out of the park.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.460
This is not about that.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.862
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

22:09.896 --> 22:14.467
I have a big,
big favor to ask you.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.436
I need you to come to Seattle.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.037
What? Why?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.006
Uh...

22:20.039 --> 22:21.641
It's about Mark and the kids.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.610
Jesus, now you're scaring me.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.978
Yeah, you're not the only one.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.616
All right, I'm sitting down,
so tell me what happened.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.851
Okay, um...

22:31.884 --> 22:34.153
I know it sounds really crazy,

22:34.186 --> 22:37.590
and it's, uh, short notice,

22:37.624 --> 22:40.593
but I need you to vouch for me.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.395
Vouch for you?
What...

22:42.429 --> 22:44.030
I don't get it.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.063
Ted...

22:47.434 --> 22:48.701
I...

22:48.735 --> 22:49.702
It's really important.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.703
Yes or no.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.772
[exhales] Um...

22:52.805 --> 22:54.116
I'm gonna
have to scramble around,

22:54.140 --> 22:56.108
get someone to cover
my classes, but yes,

22:56.142 --> 22:57.444
of course.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.979
If it's that important to you,
whatever you need, Nomi.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.013
Okay.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.550
Thank you so much.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.618
Uh, come to the North Precinct
police station

23:05.652 --> 23:07.954
tomorrow morning,

23:07.987 --> 23:09.097
and ask for Detective Krantz.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.189
Krantz, okay.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.491
Uh, sure.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.626
But Nomi...

23:13.660 --> 23:14.961
what the hell is going on?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.666
You're the best, Ted.

23:19.699 --> 23:20.967
Really.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.569
I owe you one.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.424
[phone ringing]

23:48.027 --> 23:49.228
How did it go?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.531
The restraining order
has been delivered.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.932
I don't foresee any more issues.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.037
Thanks, Donovan.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.739
We'll touch base tomorrow.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.676
So... how did it go?

24:03.710 --> 24:05.745
Our alibi is in the bag.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.680
That's a relief.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.882
Now you can just focus on us.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.951
Daddy?

24:11.984 --> 24:13.653
I don't like it here.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.187
When can we go home?

24:19.191 --> 24:20.493
Soon, honey.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.194
Very soon.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.577
[Mark]: Trust me, you're going
to love this park.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.646
Can I go on the swings?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.513
The swings?

25:14.547 --> 25:15.947
Of course, you can go
on the swings.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.627
Jane...

25:27.660 --> 25:29.762
how come you don't
like your new Mommy?

25:29.796 --> 25:30.830
I just don't.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.265
Why do I have to call her that?

25:33.299 --> 25:36.035
Because your old Mommy is sick,

25:36.068 --> 25:39.939
and I know you love her,
and you miss her,

25:39.972 --> 25:42.308
but if you ever see her,

25:42.341 --> 25:43.843
you can't talk to her.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.645
Why?

25:45.678 --> 25:47.580
It's hard to explain.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.983
You just can't.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.086
She's... dangerous.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.136
Want to go on the slide?

26:10.169 --> 26:11.170
Yeah!

26:11.203 --> 26:12.203
All right.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.618
You see,

26:25.652 --> 26:27.362
your old mommy can hurt
you and your brother

26:27.386 --> 26:28.220
because she's sick.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.956
I'm counting on you, Jane.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.691
You understand?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.059
I think so.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.393
Good.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.695
And if you're in trouble,

26:35.728 --> 26:37.329
if someone like your old mommy,

26:37.363 --> 26:38.931
tries to take you and Aiden,

26:38.965 --> 26:40.166
what do you do?

26:40.199 --> 26:42.334
Find a police officer?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.103
That's right.

26:44.136 --> 26:48.207
Find a police officer
or call 911.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.745
Remember, I love you.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.717
Let's go, let's get out of here.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.397
[yelps]

27:11.430 --> 27:12.364
Hi, Mrs. G.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.966
Lyle?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.201
If you scream,

27:15.234 --> 27:18.805
you're going to have to learn
to make do with one kidney.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.810
You're helping them.

27:23.843 --> 27:24.844
What's going on?

27:24.877 --> 27:26.879
Why are they doing this to me?

27:29.015 --> 27:30.015
[gasps]

27:31.017 --> 27:32.284
Get in.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.254
[gasping in panic]

29:37.043 --> 29:38.510
[cell phone vibrates]

29:45.484 --> 29:48.988
Now what?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.301
Yeah, we'll do
lots of great stuff.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.326
[incoming message chimes]

29:54.360 --> 29:55.928
One second.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.403
All right,
we've got to hurry, baby.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.504
Come on.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.494
[♪♪]

32:01.587 --> 32:04.223
Son of a bitch.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.114
What's going on?

32:28.147 --> 32:30.049
I got a text from Lyle.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.683
He said to meet him here.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.152
Me too.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.487
[cell phone rings]

32:35.521 --> 32:38.324
Just one second, sweetie.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.425
Hello?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.393
We got a problem.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.494
What happened?

32:42.528 --> 32:44.696
I saw her at the park, alone.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.265
I thought I could take her.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.342
And instead she got your phone,

32:47.366 --> 32:50.269
and now she knows everything.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.379
I'm just cleaning up
after your mess.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.315
Besides, I took care
of that other thing, didn't I?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.041
I can fix this.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.108
Prove it.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.976
Find her and shut her up.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.548
Everything's fine.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.550
We're going back to the hotel.

33:04.583 --> 33:05.584
Come on.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.985
Come on, everyone.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.298
Janie!

33:19.331 --> 33:20.532
Slow down.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.834
[door latch rattles]

33:30.842 --> 33:32.378
Stay right here, okay?

33:34.746 --> 33:36.014
It's okay, sweetie.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.069
[sighs]

33:59.805 --> 34:01.740
Mark, come look at this.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.379
There's no one here.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.648
There was.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.722
Wonderful.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.157
I spend all this money
on hackers,

34:18.190 --> 34:19.234
and now they're going
to catch us

34:19.257 --> 34:20.259
because I left this out.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.270
Hey, no one's getting caught.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.078
Jane...

34:42.581 --> 34:45.251
I know that you're scared,

34:45.284 --> 34:47.585
but I also know
that you're very brave.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.322
That's what makes you
such a great astronaut.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.591
Give Mommy a hug.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.669
[gasps]

35:07.439 --> 35:09.741
[sobbing softly]

35:42.508 --> 35:43.842
See ya.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.679
Oscar! Oscar...

35:48.814 --> 35:49.815
Hi.

35:49.848 --> 35:50.848
Hi.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.353
Uh, are you okay?

35:54.386 --> 35:55.654
Yeah. Uh...

35:56.922 --> 35:58.724
Who am I?

35:59.825 --> 36:01.159
[chuckles]

36:03.595 --> 36:05.531
Um... you're Nomi Gardner?

36:09.701 --> 36:10.902
We need to talk.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.638
Okay. Right now?

36:12.671 --> 36:13.905
Yeah. It's important.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.274
Okay.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.909
Um... my car is over here.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.311
- Okay?
- Yeah.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.784
Okay, so wait, let me
get this straight,

36:25.817 --> 36:27.953
you have a cousin
in the U.K. who's loaded,

36:27.986 --> 36:29.821
and who just passed away,

36:29.855 --> 36:31.866
and even though you didn't know
this person existed,

36:31.890 --> 36:35.361
he wills you his entire estate?

36:35.394 --> 36:36.804
Not the whole thing,
only five million U.S.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.828
From what I can make out,
the rest goes to charity.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.832
Only five million.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.302
Mark must have intercepted
the first letter from the lawyer

36:43.335 --> 36:44.670
and never told me.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.737
Now Brenda Johnson,

36:45.771 --> 36:48.807
my neighbor in Olympia is dead.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.976
I can't believe they're
willing to go this far.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.511
So you think I'm next

36:52.544 --> 36:55.681
because I know
you're the real Nomi Gardner.

36:55.714 --> 36:59.285
No one else west of the Rockies
can pick me out of a lineup.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.820
Even my publisher doesn't know
what I look like.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.589
We do everything
by email and phone.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.590
This is crazy.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.657
No kidding.

37:05.691 --> 37:06.892
No, this is...

37:06.925 --> 37:09.528
[laughing in disbelief]
really crazy.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.561
Wait.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.974
How do I know
you weren't planning this

37:12.998 --> 37:14.533
when we met at the hotel?

37:15.801 --> 37:16.702
What?

37:16.735 --> 37:17.969
For all I know,

37:18.003 --> 37:19.805
you're the one
pulling the scam, not them.

37:24.543 --> 37:25.543
You want to know how?

37:26.545 --> 37:28.480
This is how.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.416
There's no author photo,
I looked.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.859
I know, I'm too humble
for my own good,

37:31.883 --> 37:32.960
but that's not what I meant.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.520
Just pick a page.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.621
Uh...

37:35.654 --> 37:36.422
Just start reading, anywhere.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.423
Okay.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.757
Um...

37:38.790 --> 37:40.659
"She crossed the street
at a run,

37:40.692 --> 37:41.760
"driven by an impulse

37:41.793 --> 37:42.894
she could not
contain..."

37:42.928 --> 37:44.739
"The boulevards and alleyways
were unusually empty.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.998
"It was as if the city
held its breath

37:47.032 --> 37:49.701
"out of respect,
or perhaps pity.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.637
"She felt that
if she came to a decision,

37:51.670 --> 37:54.373
this moment of peace
would end."

37:55.574 --> 37:57.776
Are you convinced yet,
or should I keep going?

37:57.809 --> 37:59.811
That was amazing.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.881
Will you help me?

38:10.055 --> 38:11.523
When's the last time you ate?

38:11.557 --> 38:12.658
I'm not sure.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.960
It's been a blur.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.995
Okay, I'm going to feed you.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.498
And you can also
take a nap, if you like.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.699
There's no time.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.909
We have to go to the police,
both of us.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.335
And say what?

38:23.369 --> 38:25.471
The truth.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.605
With...

38:26.638 --> 38:29.040
With you vouching for me,
proof of these documents,

38:29.074 --> 38:30.642
and Ted coming in tomorrow,

38:30.676 --> 38:31.886
the police will
have to listen to me.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.345
And then

38:33.379 --> 38:34.922
I can get a court order
for a maternity test

38:34.946 --> 38:37.583
and I can get my kids back.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.751
[crash and clatter outside]

38:39.785 --> 38:41.319
What was that?

38:44.756 --> 38:46.358
Don't go out there.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.559
Take it easy.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.628
Not everything's a conspiracy.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.844
Oscar?

39:10.416 --> 39:11.416
Oscar?

39:13.118 --> 39:14.118
It's fine!

39:16.455 --> 39:18.557
Probably just the wind.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.691
[screams]

39:19.725 --> 39:21.205
[Taser crackling,
Oscar gasps in pain]

39:25.997 --> 39:28.534
[Taser crackling]

39:58.597 --> 40:02.400
Somebody's been looking
at things they should not be.

40:06.672 --> 40:07.849
I'm surprised
you didn't turn off

40:07.873 --> 40:09.541
my phone tracker.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.176
Not too smart
for a mystery writer.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.988
Don't do this.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.924
That money is legally mine.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.594
Let me go, and you can
name your price.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.428
You're wasting
your breath, lady.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.135
I figure...

40:37.168 --> 40:38.937
this poor guy,

40:38.970 --> 40:40.247
he's just sitting down
for dinner

40:40.271 --> 40:43.975
when some crazy woman breaks in,

40:44.009 --> 40:47.145
and she's got a bogus story
about, uh...

40:47.178 --> 40:50.516
you know, somebody
stole her life.

40:50.549 --> 40:51.750
He asks her to leave,

40:51.783 --> 40:55.053
she wouldn't,

40:55.086 --> 40:58.924
so he has to defend himself.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.793
[laughs, scoffing]

41:03.962 --> 41:05.597
What's so funny?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.174
You haven't thought this
through, have you?

41:07.198 --> 41:08.767
What's that supposed to mean?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.804
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

41:12.838 --> 41:14.198
but they want
both of us dead, yes?

41:15.707 --> 41:17.809
Well...

41:17.843 --> 41:20.612
if he hits me with the bat,
then how did I kill him?

41:24.182 --> 41:26.251
And then there's the problem
of the stun gun.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.919
Unless the M.E.
is really incompetent,

41:27.953 --> 41:30.055
then they're gonna find
burn marks in my back.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.165
How are you going
to explain that?

41:31.189 --> 41:33.224
You think you're
pretty smart, huh?

41:33.258 --> 41:35.260
I come up with this stuff
for a living.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.162
Not anymore.

41:40.832 --> 41:41.933
Okay...

41:41.967 --> 41:43.234
[sniffs]

41:43.268 --> 41:46.104
Here's the re-write.

41:46.137 --> 41:49.174
You hit him with the bat,

41:49.207 --> 41:51.176
then he shot you
with the stun gun,

41:51.209 --> 41:52.210
twice.

41:56.014 --> 42:00.185
Your ticker
couldn't handle the voltage.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.820
Happened to a guy I knew
in the joint.

42:01.853 --> 42:02.988
You've been in prison.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.290
Why am I not surprised?

42:13.164 --> 42:16.568
I guess I can't appeal
to your better nature.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.537
You could if I had one.

42:38.957 --> 42:39.957
[groaning and struggling]

42:45.096 --> 42:46.297
[groans in pain]

42:52.704 --> 42:55.306
[blows thud]

42:57.843 --> 42:59.711
[Lyle groans in pain]

43:09.120 --> 43:10.756
[groaning]
Is he gone?

43:10.789 --> 43:11.857
I think so.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.058
Are you okay?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.627
Uh... yeah.

43:15.661 --> 43:19.831
You know, it's just
another Saturday night.

43:19.865 --> 43:21.667
[groaning in pain]

43:38.850 --> 43:41.853
[cell phone vibrating]

43:46.892 --> 43:48.193
Tell me it's done.

43:48.226 --> 43:49.795
[breathing hard]
Not exactly.

43:51.096 --> 43:52.130
"Not exactly"?

43:52.163 --> 43:53.865
What the hell does that mean?

43:53.899 --> 43:56.067
It means the bitch hit me
with a bat, all right?

43:56.101 --> 43:58.169
What the hell was she doing
with a baseball bat?

43:58.203 --> 43:59.446
No, wait, I don't even
want to know that.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.740
This is...
This is unbelievable.

44:01.773 --> 44:03.308
It was two against one.

44:03.341 --> 44:04.876
I mean, what did you
expect me to do?

44:04.910 --> 44:06.344
What am I paying you for?

44:06.377 --> 44:08.413
No, scratch that.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.915
Get back here,

44:09.948 --> 44:11.282
and make sure no one sees you.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.820
What are you doing?

44:16.454 --> 44:17.655
I'm cutting our losses.

44:19.758 --> 44:20.768
We've just got to get through

44:20.792 --> 44:22.761
the next 24 hours,

44:22.794 --> 44:24.029
and that money is ours.

44:25.230 --> 44:28.133
The longest 24 hours of my life.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.035
I know, it won't be easy.

44:31.469 --> 44:34.339
We'll be back home in our bed,

44:34.372 --> 44:36.742
and she'll be rotting away
in a mental hospital.

44:36.775 --> 44:40.111
And then our children
will be back where they belong,

44:40.145 --> 44:41.679
with me.

44:42.447 --> 44:44.149
Exactly.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.354
It's okay, Aiden.

44:49.387 --> 44:52.891
Our real mommy's
going to come for us.

45:05.470 --> 45:06.972
[wincing]

45:08.840 --> 45:11.142
We need to call the police.

45:11.176 --> 45:14.479
I already tried that.

45:14.512 --> 45:16.782
Come on, they tried to kill us.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.784
The cops can't ignore this now.

45:18.817 --> 45:21.186
They did before.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.388
You said you needed someone
to back up your story.

45:23.421 --> 45:24.421
Here I am.

45:28.193 --> 45:29.193
Hey...

45:31.362 --> 45:33.431
What did I say?

45:33.464 --> 45:35.901
It's not you.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.471
My husband's been sleeping
with another woman

45:40.505 --> 45:43.508
for God knows how long,

45:43.541 --> 45:46.177
and he just sent someone
to kill me.

45:46.211 --> 45:48.113
Twice.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.051
[sighs in anguish]

45:53.084 --> 45:55.353
Nomi. Hey.

46:17.575 --> 46:20.278
I can't put you in danger.

46:20.311 --> 46:22.347
What are you talking about?

46:22.380 --> 46:25.350
They're willing
to commit murder.

46:25.383 --> 46:26.928
Do you really want to look
over your shoulder

46:26.952 --> 46:28.086
for the rest of your life?

46:28.119 --> 46:32.423
Oh, hey, I can
take care of myself.

46:39.164 --> 46:41.532
[sighs heavily]

46:46.872 --> 46:51.242
I need to leave.

46:51.276 --> 46:55.313
Nomi, I can't let you do this.

46:55.346 --> 46:58.984
You're going to have to.

46:59.017 --> 47:00.585
Nomi...

47:01.619 --> 47:03.554
No, Nomi, don't go.

47:03.588 --> 47:05.523
Nomi...

47:54.372 --> 47:58.176
[roar of traffic]

48:24.735 --> 48:26.271
This is the second time
this month.

48:26.304 --> 48:28.073
Sorry I'm late.

48:28.106 --> 48:29.040
Is he here?

48:29.074 --> 48:29.975
Yes.

48:30.008 --> 48:31.309
Right this way, Miss...

48:31.342 --> 48:32.342
Yeah.

48:45.991 --> 48:46.992
Teddy...

48:49.227 --> 48:50.628
I'm so glad to see you.

48:50.661 --> 48:53.498
[stammering] I thought
I was here for Nomi.

48:54.665 --> 48:56.701
Teddy...

48:56.734 --> 48:59.137
tell her it's me.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.072
Are you saying
this is not Nomi Gardner?

49:02.740 --> 49:04.275
Look, I...

49:04.309 --> 49:06.311
I'm a busy man, okay? I...

49:06.344 --> 49:07.345
I dropped everything

49:07.378 --> 49:08.522
to get on the redeye from Boston

49:08.546 --> 49:10.581
because she said
it was an emergency,

49:10.615 --> 49:12.383
I haven't had a wink of sleep,

49:12.417 --> 49:15.020
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd quit wasting my time.

49:15.053 --> 49:17.155
Oh, my God.

49:17.188 --> 49:18.356
Not you, too.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.091
Mr. Curtis,

49:20.125 --> 49:23.094
do you know this woman?

49:29.567 --> 49:31.469
I've never seen her before
in my life.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.171
- Dammit!
- Miss March!

49:33.204 --> 49:34.548
- Damn you for this!
- You need to calm down!

49:34.572 --> 49:36.741
How much did they offer you?
A hundred grand? Two?

49:36.774 --> 49:38.609
It's a drop
in the bucket, Teddy.

49:38.643 --> 49:39.477
That's enough!

49:39.510 --> 49:41.512
Let me tell you,
they're ripping you off.

49:41.546 --> 49:44.382
$5 million, that's how much
is in the trust.

49:44.415 --> 49:46.517
That's a lot
of gin and tonics, Teddy.

49:46.551 --> 49:49.220
Don't let them
get you cheap, Teddy!

49:52.690 --> 49:54.359
You can let go of me now.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.061
Are you going to stay calm?

49:56.094 --> 49:56.994
Yeah, I'm gonna stay calm.

49:57.028 --> 49:59.297
You've been warned,
you need to go home

49:59.330 --> 50:00.774
before you get yourself
into more trouble,

50:00.798 --> 50:02.033
do you understand?

50:02.067 --> 50:04.169
More trouble?

50:04.202 --> 50:06.104
How am I gonna get
in any more trouble?

50:06.137 --> 50:07.305
There she is.

50:07.338 --> 50:10.308
Detective, this woman has
violated her restraining order.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.752
Now, these are declarations
from my clients

50:11.776 --> 50:13.687
stating that she broke into
their hotel room yesterday

50:13.711 --> 50:16.181
and threatened their children.

50:16.214 --> 50:17.415
That's not true.

50:17.448 --> 50:19.050
Janie and Aiden were not there.

50:19.084 --> 50:20.651
You see, this woman
is clearly a menace.

50:20.685 --> 50:21.828
Now we suggest
that she be detained

50:21.852 --> 50:23.254
under Title 71

50:23.288 --> 50:24.422
for her own protection.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.524
You son of a bitch!

50:26.557 --> 50:28.326
You leave me no choice.
Officers...

50:28.359 --> 50:30.395
I am placing you

50:30.428 --> 50:31.638
under involuntary
psychiatric detention

50:31.662 --> 50:33.464
for 72 hours.

50:33.498 --> 50:35.266
Get a warrant,
and search the hotel room.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.735
You will find documents
that prove my inheritance.

50:37.768 --> 50:39.546
You will be evaluated
at a county medical facility

50:39.570 --> 50:42.340
by a mental health professional.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.384
You have the right to speak
to your attorney

50:43.408 --> 50:44.409
during this time.

50:44.442 --> 50:46.644
You can't do this!

50:46.677 --> 50:49.180
No! No!

50:49.214 --> 50:50.615
No!

50:50.648 --> 50:51.716
What's going on?

50:51.749 --> 50:54.485
Where are they taking her?

50:54.519 --> 50:55.529
That depends
on what her shrink says

50:55.553 --> 50:57.788
about her mental state.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.822
I'm sorry you had to come
all this way for nothing.

51:01.392 --> 51:02.527
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.594
Mm-hmm.

51:03.628 --> 51:07.198
There is only one thing
I'm curious about, though.

51:07.232 --> 51:09.734
You said that Nomi Gardner
asked you to come.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.836
But she didn't show.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.371
Just Miss March did.

51:13.404 --> 51:14.739
What's your point?

51:15.873 --> 51:17.508
I have no point.

51:17.542 --> 51:19.810
I just... found it strange,
that's all.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.313
It's a strange world.

51:23.881 --> 51:26.284
I have no argument there.

51:26.317 --> 51:27.285
Excuse me.

51:27.318 --> 51:28.753
Mm-hmm.

51:34.159 --> 51:35.726
[sighs]

51:36.827 --> 51:38.396
Yeah.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.398
It's done.

51:47.672 --> 51:51.142
I want to speak
to a lawyer right now.

51:51.176 --> 51:53.144
Are you listening to me?

51:53.178 --> 51:56.814
I have the right
to speak to an attorney!

52:14.765 --> 52:16.201
No...

52:16.234 --> 52:17.768
No, please, no.

52:17.802 --> 52:18.903
This is a mistake.

52:18.936 --> 52:21.339
You can't do this to me!

52:21.372 --> 52:23.208
Please, no... no!

52:23.241 --> 52:24.709
No, no, no, no...

52:24.742 --> 52:27.545
[sobbing] No!

52:28.613 --> 52:30.215
Please...

52:30.248 --> 52:32.483
[sobbing in anguish]

52:48.566 --> 52:51.869
[screaming]
My name is Nomi Gardner!

52:56.006 --> 52:57.475
Please, please, please...

52:57.508 --> 52:58.809
Hello?

52:58.843 --> 53:00.611
Please, my kids need me.

53:00.645 --> 53:01.946
Let me out!

53:01.979 --> 53:03.914
Please... my kids!

53:03.948 --> 53:05.316
[sobbing] Please...

53:12.823 --> 53:15.960
Please... my kids need me!

53:15.993 --> 53:17.562
[sobbing in panic]

53:17.595 --> 53:21.532
Help me, help me!

53:21.566 --> 53:22.833
[screaming and banging]

53:24.569 --> 53:28.673
Let me out!

53:41.619 --> 53:42.620
Would you stop that?

53:42.653 --> 53:43.821
You're making me nervous.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.323
You're nervous?

53:45.356 --> 53:47.525
I just arranged a murder
and had my wife committed.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.026
She's a vindictive schizophrenic

53:49.059 --> 53:51.262
and Brenda Johnson died
in a freak accident.

53:51.296 --> 53:52.296
Patience.

53:53.498 --> 53:54.665
Refresh it again.

53:54.699 --> 53:56.267
It's automatic.

53:56.301 --> 53:57.735
Just humor me, please?

53:57.768 --> 53:59.370
[sighs wearily]

54:00.971 --> 54:02.440
It's here.

54:03.608 --> 54:04.775
[laughing in triumph]

54:04.809 --> 54:07.845
Oh ye of little faith.

54:08.979 --> 54:11.749
So... how does it feel

54:11.782 --> 54:14.452
to be a very rich man,
Mr. Gardner?

54:14.485 --> 54:17.288
You want to know how
it feels, Mrs. Gardner?

54:17.322 --> 54:19.457
[giggling]

54:22.927 --> 54:25.630
I always knew
my dreams would come true.

54:25.663 --> 54:26.631
[chuckles]

54:26.664 --> 54:28.566
[baby starts crying]

54:28.599 --> 54:29.934
Damn, he has some lungs on him.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.402
[sighs heavily]
It's okay,

54:31.436 --> 54:32.603
I'll take care of it.

54:32.637 --> 54:36.040
After all, I am his mother.

54:36.073 --> 54:37.308
You really love him,

54:37.342 --> 54:39.777
don't you?

54:39.810 --> 54:41.412
Like he was my own.

54:41.446 --> 54:43.381
[giggles]

54:43.414 --> 54:45.383
[baby screaming in distress]

55:24.655 --> 55:26.357
Who is it?

55:26.391 --> 55:27.758
The professor.

55:29.627 --> 55:31.496
And what does he want?

55:31.529 --> 55:33.398
[doorbell rings]

55:33.431 --> 55:35.032
[knocks]

55:38.102 --> 55:39.504
Nomi?

55:39.537 --> 55:41.939
Well, I'll be damned.

55:41.972 --> 55:43.941
Love what you've done
with your hair.

55:43.974 --> 55:45.476
What do you want?

55:45.510 --> 55:47.512
I just wanted to see
your new place.

55:48.946 --> 55:52.983
Nice neighborhood.

55:53.017 --> 55:56.020
I'll bet the crime rate
is really low.

55:56.053 --> 55:57.655
And there's
the man of the house.

55:57.688 --> 56:00.024
Congratulations
on your recent windfall, Mark,

56:00.057 --> 56:02.493
but hey, if anyone
deserves it, you do.

56:02.527 --> 56:03.994
Your money's on the way.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.563
Well, that's wonderful news.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.598
I am enjoying my stay.

56:07.632 --> 56:09.400
It's a beautiful hotel
you put me in.

56:09.434 --> 56:11.502
Well, we're very appreciative.

56:11.536 --> 56:13.170
Excellent, then
I'm sure you won't mind

56:13.203 --> 56:16.407
adding another little zero
to that hundred grand.

56:16.441 --> 56:17.341
[laughs]

56:17.374 --> 56:19.710
You're even more
of a lush than I thought.

56:19.744 --> 56:21.446
She's right.

56:21.479 --> 56:23.714
You get what we agreed to,
not a cent more.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.950
Nomi...
[clearing throat]

56:25.983 --> 56:27.718
The real Nomi...

56:27.752 --> 56:29.454
She told me
how much you two are making

56:29.487 --> 56:30.688
off this little scam,

56:30.721 --> 56:32.189
and I am not so old
and miserable

56:32.222 --> 56:34.024
that I am gonna
sell out a friend

56:34.058 --> 56:35.826
for table scraps.

56:35.860 --> 56:36.927
Now, come on, Mark,

56:36.961 --> 56:39.039
I don't think you're
in any position to bargain here.

56:39.063 --> 56:42.199
You don't want me going back
to that police station

56:42.232 --> 56:44.835
and changing my story.

56:45.770 --> 56:48.473
250.

56:49.874 --> 56:51.476
500,000,

56:51.509 --> 56:52.977
not a cent less.

56:55.980 --> 56:56.947
Fine.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.983
Fine?

56:59.016 --> 57:00.718
Just pay him
and get him out of here.

57:00.751 --> 57:01.995
Pleasure doing
business with you.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.654
I'll be the one in my hotel room

57:03.688 --> 57:04.589
checking my balance,

57:04.622 --> 57:05.823
and hey,

57:05.856 --> 57:07.958
I think you should
hurry up and act on this,

57:07.992 --> 57:09.159
because, uh,

57:09.193 --> 57:13.063
my flight to Bermuda
leaves at 9:00 tonight.

57:15.232 --> 57:17.602
[door closes]

57:25.610 --> 57:29.046
My ex had a Chihuahua like that.

57:29.079 --> 57:32.717
He bit me
after I gave him a chew toy.

57:32.750 --> 57:36.020
How would you like a raise?

57:40.891 --> 57:42.893
[gasping and struggling]

57:55.806 --> 57:57.875
[bones crunch]

58:29.640 --> 58:30.675
It had to be done.

58:30.708 --> 58:31.642
Even if we paid him,

58:31.676 --> 58:33.711
there's no guarantees
he wouldn't be back.

58:34.945 --> 58:37.582
[Jane, worried] Is everything
okay down there?

58:37.615 --> 58:38.883
Perfectly fine, sweetie.

58:38.916 --> 58:39.917
I'll be up in a minute.

58:39.950 --> 58:42.119
[baby Aiden crying]

58:43.788 --> 58:45.756
Next time you try
to tie up a loose end,

58:45.790 --> 58:47.000
try not to do it
in our front yard

58:47.024 --> 58:48.225
where the children can see.

58:48.258 --> 58:49.760
Hey, a little reminder.

58:49.794 --> 58:52.797
We just became
millionaires today.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.132
You're right.

58:55.165 --> 58:56.133
[baby screaming upstairs]

58:56.166 --> 58:59.570
Excuse me, Jane and Aiden
need their mother.

58:59.604 --> 59:01.806
[baby screaming]

59:04.742 --> 59:08.946
[♪♪]

59:14.051 --> 59:16.286
Thank you, Ian.

59:17.855 --> 59:20.591
Have a seat, Miss March.

59:20.625 --> 59:23.327
I'd rather stand.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.130
Suit yourself.

59:28.132 --> 59:29.834
Do you understand
why you're here?

59:31.335 --> 59:32.837
I'm on a psych hold,

59:32.870 --> 59:35.039
what they'd call a 5150
in California,

59:35.072 --> 59:36.006
and you're the shrink

59:36.040 --> 59:38.843
who's supposed to decide
just how crazy I am.

59:38.876 --> 59:40.978
[chuckles]
That's right,

59:41.011 --> 59:44.649
only we don't use the term
"crazy" here.

59:44.682 --> 59:46.984
How very enlightened of you.

59:50.821 --> 59:51.789
In my first book,

59:51.822 --> 59:54.124
my protagonist ended up
in a place like this.

59:57.161 --> 59:59.063
I did my research,
but I have to say,

59:59.096 --> 01:00:02.399
it's really different being
on this side of the desk.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.734
Ah, yes.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:05.045
You believe
you are a mystery writer

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.771
named Nomi Gardner.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.673
And when I prove that I'm right,

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:11.141
you and a lot of other people
are going to look very stupid.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.320
Well, the last thing
a man in my profession wants

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.647
is to look stupid,

01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:17.648
so...

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.083
why don't you prove it to me,

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.351
right now.

01:00:21.385 --> 01:00:23.654
I'd love to,

01:00:23.688 --> 01:00:26.190
but you and I both know that
that's not going to happen.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:33.998
Would you do me a favor?

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:37.067
Take a look in that mirror
and tell me what you see.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.136
That mirror?

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.971
Yes. Please.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:53.450
I see a woman
who's lost everything.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.353
Want to know what I see?

01:00:56.386 --> 01:01:00.290
A woman who has
everything to gain.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.126
And all I have to do

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:06.864
is pretend to be
someone I'm not, right?

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.465
I don't want you to do anything

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.368
you're not comfortable with.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.837
Really?

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:14.204
Really.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:19.143
I'm so glad to hear that.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.845
Thank you.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:22.747
And I'm sorry.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.081
For what?

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:26.016
For this.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.050
[yelping in pain]

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.722

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.287
No! No!

[sobbing in distress]
No...

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:31.348
Well, the good news is
I've finished my evaluation.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.018
The bad news is

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:35.195
I think you're
going to be with us

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.188
for a lot longer than 72 hours.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.124
No...

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.425
Hold still, Greta.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.260
Hold still.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.430
Please don't do this.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:48.498
It's just a muscle relaxant.

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.935
We don't want you biting off
your tongue, now, do we?

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:56.140
Take her to the ECT.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.118
Let's see if we can get
some electro-shock therapy

01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.276
to jog something loose.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.267
Please...

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.537
This is a mistake.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.975
I'm not... Greta March.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.180
I'm Nomi Gardner.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:39.884
Nomi Gardner...

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.232
I'm not...

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:57.401
I'm not who you think I am.

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:06.944
[gasping] I have...

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:10.147
I have two children.

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:14.251
They're in danger.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.589
Just try and relax, Greta.

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:22.492
My...

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:25.629

01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:30.434

[emergency alarm starts blaring]

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.389
It's probably just a drill.

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.259
There was nothing scheduled.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.193
I guess we'll
have to pick this up later.

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:03.267

You...

They need your help
in Ward C right away,

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.419
some of the psychotics
are refusing to leave.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.453
What about her?

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.022
I've got her.

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:30.227
I'm not Greta.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.129
My name is Nomi Gardner.

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:33.397
You have to believe me.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.364
I do.

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:36.033
You do?

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.137
It's me.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.605
Oh!

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.407

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.408

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.342
Can you walk?

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:48.412
I don't think so,
they gave me something.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:49.755
Well, we are just
going to have to risk it.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.981
Come on.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:52.015

Okay, let's get out of here

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:01.491
before someone realizes

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:03.227
I'm not qualified
to practice medicine.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.694
Okay.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.497
How did you find me?

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:08.708
My sister is a dispatch officer.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.634
She owed me a favor.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.736
I thought I told you
to stay out of it.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:14.038
Can I be honest?

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:15.672
Yeah.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.117
I think letting someone
with your talent

01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:18.608
waste away in a mental hospital

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.245
would be a crime
against literature.

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:24.714
Okay.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:32.755
This way.

you're doing?

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.142
Uh-oh.

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:54.511
That woman is my patient!

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:55.679

You're welcome.

Listen, I don't want
to rain on your parade,

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.632
but we're officially
fugitives from justice now.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:16.766
Got any ideas?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.203
Only one.

Get my kids.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.372

want to constantly

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.668
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:12.969
Hello?

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.904
I need a police officer.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:17.006
Okay. What's your name?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.342
These are my children!

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:19.743
This is my husband!

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:20.886
Don't you dare ever question

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.812
my commitment
to this family again!

01:11:24.448 --> 01:11:25.715
Listen...

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.517
both of you.

01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:28.794
We have a really
good thing going here,

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.287
so settle down.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.960
[baby Aiden starts screaming]

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:39.463
Now look what you've done.

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:46.503
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:49.606
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry,
Mommy's here.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:50.707
Hi, sweetie!

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.942
Aw...

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.512
are you hungry?

01:11:55.545 --> 01:11:57.747
Oh, yes, you must be so hungry,

01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:00.617
because Mommy hasn't been
feeding you, has she?

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.753
Let me find your bottle, okay?

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.855
There you go.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:06.956
Good boy.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.826
Good boy.
Where's your bottle?

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:11.395
[baby crying in distress]

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.863
Where's the damn bottle?

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.101
[baby screaming]

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:20.737
[shouting] Mark!
Where's the bottle!

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:27.052
She's taking
this new mother thing

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.078
pretty serious, huh?

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:31.047
Shut it, Lyle.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.383
[Greta shouting]: Mark!
Can you get it for me, please!

01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:36.953
[mocking] "Mark, can you
get it for me, please?"

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:38.755
[Mark shouting]: I don't
know where it is!

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:40.089
Damn it, keep your voice down!

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:43.793
Jane, don't let
all that yelling scare you.

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:47.030
Jane?

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:55.939
Our daughter is missing.

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:57.006
Are you sure?

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.475
Of course I'm sure.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.911
Jane!

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:02.945
Jane?

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:05.715
Damn.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.517
I knew she would do this.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:14.057
You take the front yard,
I will take the back.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:15.725
She couldn't have gotten far.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:21.064
Watch the baby.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:22.699
Me?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.535
Mother of the year.

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.841
What's going on in there?

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.877
No idea.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.078
All I know is

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.781
that psychopath is with my kids.

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:38.915
Hey, wait.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.917
I'm not so sure about this.

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.852
Then stay here.

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:43.887
I'm going in.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.421
Nomi...

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.465
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:57.667
Okay.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:06.042
[baby screaming]

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:08.945
You are wasting your breath,
little guy!

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:10.747
[baby crying and screaming]

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:17.487
[turns on TV]

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:19.155
[increases volume]

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:22.125
That's better.

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.827
Breaking news.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.962
Authorities are warning
King County residents

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:27.531
to be on the lookout
for a patient

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:28.941
who escaped
from a psychiatric facility

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.266
near Red Bank.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.036
The patient, Greta March, 39,

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.047
is described as dangerous
to herself and to others,

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:36.816
and may be accompanied
by an unidentified male

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.275
in his early-to-mid-30s.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.010
If you see
either one of these people,

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:42.245
do not try to approach them.

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:45.515
Instead,
call 9-1-1 immediately.

01:14:45.549 --> 01:14:47.216
[baby screaming]

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.203
[cell phone rings]

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.044
Yeah?

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.846
She escaped.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.047
What?

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.883
Nomi. I just saw it
on the news.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.685
I think she's with the bellhop.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:24.954
This situation's getting
way too out of hand.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.557
What if this plays in Boston,
and somebody sees it, hmm?

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:28.758
Or, or...

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.193
what if she comes for her kids?

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.728
You've got
to hold it together, Lyle.

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:34.698
Hold it together?

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.232
She could bring heat,

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:38.134
serious heat down on us.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.736
[whispering] Oh...

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:41.838
Hi. Hi...

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.840
Are you okay?

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.042
Did you miss me?

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:53.116
We're going to get you
out of here, okay?

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:55.585
But you have to be
really, really quiet.

01:15:55.619 --> 01:15:57.020
Okay? No crying.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.122
Can you do that for me?

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:00.624
Okay.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:01.958
Okay...

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:05.161
Let's go find your sister.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.563
Come on.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:10.766
Jane?

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:12.768
Jane?

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.973
Yeah, we're gonna need
another exit strategy.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.945
Listen, Lyle,

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:24.013
you need to deal
with this... now.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.349
Yeah.

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.984
Okay.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:30.863
This mess just keeps
getting bigger.

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.155
Okay, you just need to focus

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.623
on finding our daughter, okay?

01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:34.657
Jane!

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.143
[stool thuds]

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.287
Whoa, whoa, I wouldn't do that.

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:56.780
Oh, yeah?

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:58.014
Yeah, he's right.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:16:59.716
Before you got your phone back,

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:00.717
I made a copy
of the memory card,

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.790
and I gave it to the cops.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:04.020
They have all your texts,
all your phone records.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:05.822
They know everything, Lyle.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.623
They can do that?

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:10.660
Where is my daughter?

01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:12.061
She took off.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.773
She was getting
pretty fed up with those two,

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:15.374
and I'm... I'm starting
to see her point.

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:18.234
She took off?

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:19.836
[sirens wail]

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:28.712
Hi there.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.213
Are you a police officer?

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.215
Yes, I am.
What's the matter, honey?

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:33.817
I want my mommy!

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.027
Okay, okay, let's see
what we can do.

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:35.952
Can you tell me your name?

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.020
Jane.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:38.387
That's a pretty name.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.255
Jane what?

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:40.256
Jane Gardner.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:41.224
And is this your house?

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.926
Jane!

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:45.762
I'm Mark Gardner,
that's my daughter.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.230
Oh, Jane, where have you been?

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.298
You scared the heck out of us.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.409
We received a 9-1-1
from a child

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:51.835
saying she needed help.

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:53.837
I'm so sorry,

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.272
my daughter has
a very vivid imagination.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:57.841
No, they're lying!

01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:59.776
I want my real mommy!

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:00.910
Don't say that,

01:18:00.944 --> 01:18:01.911
you're hurting
your mother's feelings.

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:03.246
Okay, I'm sorry,

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.247
but I'm going to need to see
I.D.s from both of you.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.381
Of course.

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.414
Yeah.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.766
I never thought
things would go this far.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.259
They kept changing the plan.

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.763
Well, it's not too late
to run if you want to.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:21.930
Run?

01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:26.469
Go.

01:18:26.502 --> 01:18:27.737
All right.

01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:28.738
Okay.

01:18:28.772 --> 01:18:29.773
Yeah.

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:34.944
[sighs in relief]

01:18:34.978 --> 01:18:35.945
Is that true,

01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:37.914
about his phone?

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.148
I wish.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.384
Come on, we have to find Jane
before they do.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.418
You go.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.451
I'll take the baby.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.089
Okay. Just take him.

01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:47.090
There you go.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:48.091
There we go.

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:49.525
Hi. Hey...

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.360
I think he likes you.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.164
Yeah, well, who could
blame him, right?

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:57.100
[chuckles]

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:00.970
Not me.

01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:02.004
[laughs nervously]

01:19:02.872 --> 01:19:05.074
[front door shuts]

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:06.142
Okay, honey, um,

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:07.352
you're going to have to go
with your parents, okay?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.979
No, please, I don't want to!

01:19:10.013 --> 01:19:11.314
Get away from her!

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:12.916
Mommy!

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:15.149
Ma'am, I'm going to have
to ask you to stay right there.

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:17.520
That's my daughter.

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:18.822
Jane, are you okay?

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:19.956
Yes!

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:21.029
That woman is Greta March.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.226
She's an escaped mental patient.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.994
Ma'am, hands on the hood
of the vehicle,

01:19:25.028 --> 01:19:26.329
spread your legs.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.264
My name is Nomi Gardner.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:30.233
That man is my husband, Mark,

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.001
and that woman is Greta March.

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:33.036
She's lying.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.303
They killed my neighbor,

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:37.440
and now they're trying to make
everyone think that she's me.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:39.108
There's a lot of money at stake.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:40.185
Take me back to the station,

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.510
do a DNA test,

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:42.922
you'll find out
that I'm telling the truth.

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:46.082
Last warning,
hands on the vehicle.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.351
You're making a mistake.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:49.953
Come here, Jane!

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.057
Please don't
believe them! Please!

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:54.958
I'm going to need
back-up here,

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:56.192
1677 Crescent Drive.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:58.261
- Possible 207A.
- Copy that.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.363
They're going to take her
away from me.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:01.831
No, they're not.

01:20:01.865 --> 01:20:03.599
Then they're going
to take away Aiden.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.868
Calm down.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:05.869
I can't live without them!

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:07.036
Ma'am, ma'am,

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:08.237
I need you to stay here!

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:10.173
Would a real mother

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:12.942
abandon her child like that?

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:14.510
Lyle!

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.543
Where's my baby!

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:19.315
Lyle!
Where's my baby?

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:21.417
Janie, get back here!

01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.551
I am your father, dammit!

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:23.452
Come here.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.055
Please don't take
my mommy away again!

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.458
Okay.
I believe you.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:30.159
Take her to the front
seat of the car.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.095
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.063
No... what?
No, no, no, no,

01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:35.107
you can't...
You can't do this.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:36.199
Yeah, well, I just did.

01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:38.534
Now, put your hands
on the vehicle!

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.568
This is wrong!

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.939
Janie!

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:44.540
You!

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:46.942
[screaming] Lyle!

01:20:49.112 --> 01:20:51.314
What are you doing in my house?

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.548
Waiting for the police.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:53.917
Oh, yeah, the, uh...

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:55.919
the handyman gave you up.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.121
I don't believe you.

01:20:58.154 --> 01:21:00.123
Look, just let me have my baby,

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.425
and nobody else
will get hurt, I swear.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.193
Mm-mm.

01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:05.227
[baby starts screaming]

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:08.064
I am not going to let you
take this baby.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:10.934
I...

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:12.301
Please.

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:16.572
[tearfully]
Aiden...

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.074
Get out of here.

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:21.010
I... [sobbing]

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:23.511
[sighs]

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.684
Ma'am, we're not going
in that house without back-up.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.053
My son is in there!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
No! Ma'am!

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:36.059
No...

01:21:36.092 --> 01:21:37.927
[officer]: Hey,
hey, hey, hey...

01:21:39.262 --> 01:21:40.262
[skull thuds]

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:49.939
Janie, please open the door!

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:53.209
Janie!

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.011
Open the door, you little bitch!

01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:01.317
[Taser crackling]

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:06.522
Don't you ever touch
my children again.

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:13.196
[Mark calling]
Let me out!

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.048
[sobbing in relief]

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:44.293
Is this it?

01:22:44.327 --> 01:22:46.229
The results of your DNA.

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:47.530
I suspect, no more surprises?

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:49.032
None.

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:52.001
My sincere apologies,
Mrs. Gardner.

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:57.140
Your kids are waiting for you.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.553
So, what now?

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:12.321
My lawyer says
I'll have to testify.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:14.357
We both will.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.425
[chuckles]
I meant after the trial.

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.194
Once your ex
and the nanny from hell

01:23:18.227 --> 01:23:20.463
are safely behind bars.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:23.299
Well, I have a great idea
for a new book.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.567
[chuckles ruefully]

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:30.039
But first I need to catch up
with these two.

01:23:30.073 --> 01:23:33.742
Well, when you come up
to breathe, give me a call.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:36.512
I never did get the chance
to microwave you a dinner.

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:38.247
Thanks, I...

01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:39.148
I'd love that.

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:40.516
I'll be in touch.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:41.717
Bye.

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:45.588
Be careful, honey!

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:47.456
Are you going
to play with me, Mommy?

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:48.757
Of course, honey!

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.059
Let's go.

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:58.401
