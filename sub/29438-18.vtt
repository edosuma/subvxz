WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.293
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.379
I'm gonna retire.
I'd like to float your name

00:04.462 --> 00:06.923
-to the network for a possible trial run.
-(applause)

00:07.007 --> 00:09.592
This is Bill Laundry, owner of Georgia FC.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.094
Well, you guys seem to know
what you're doing.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.512
Guess it's good that Dax landed here.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.639
We only employ the best at Chastain.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.725
MONTEL:
Dawn is a single mom of seven kids

00:16.808 --> 00:18.852
that she adopted through
the Foster Care program.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.186
Will you let me
fight this cancer with you?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.314
There is only a slim hope
this will buy you more time.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.941
I will do anything

00:25.025 --> 00:27.569
against any odds to stay with my kids

00:27.652 --> 00:29.571
-as long as I can.
-Good news. Your mother

00:29.654 --> 00:31.531
is ready to leave the ICU

00:31.614 --> 00:33.033
and go to a great rehab facility.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.325
Don't give up before the miracle.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.952
-Wondering about the timing.
-Meaning?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.246
If you keep her alive,
you can claim your patient survived

00:38.329 --> 00:39.998
the Mother of All Surgeries.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.847
Does it ever get to you?

00:55.930 --> 00:58.308
These patients, kept alive by machines.

00:58.391 --> 01:02.228
They don't talk.
We have no idea what they want,

01:02.312 --> 01:05.648
or even if they're still capable
of wanting anything at all.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.985
First time moonlighting at a vent farm?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.029
Med school debt is no joke,

01:11.112 --> 01:13.156
but I'm chipping away at it.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.992
Well, we try not to get
too philosophical around here.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.036
-It's a job. Leave it at that.
-(machine beeps)

01:18.119 --> 01:19.954
Her BP's low. She's febrile.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.040
HICKS:
Nothing new for this one.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.000
Likely another pneumonia.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.877
We'll have to put her on a travel vent.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.213
-You're gonna transfer her?
-Attending's orders.

01:28.296 --> 01:31.674
If she stays hypotensive
and spikes a temp over 102,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.760
we send her back
to Chastain for treatment.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.805
Is that reasonable?
She has no meaningful brain function.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.393
This is Dawn Long.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.478
The one from TV.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.313
The Mother of All Surgeries patient.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.523
The one and only.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.904
-When was she last conscious?
-Right before she went into surgery.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.073
She's practically a corpse.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.950
We should be planning end-of-life care,

01:57.033 --> 01:59.577
-not an ICU transfer.
-Like I said,

01:59.661 --> 02:01.371
we try not to overthink.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.124
But if you really want
to make a thing out of this,

02:04.207 --> 02:06.126
take it up with Dr. Cain.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.927
WOMAN: I don't want Derek
to minimize his symptoms.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.804
Doctors could use that to dismiss him.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.014
KIT:
He will be seen by the best of the best.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.809
-You have to calm down.
-They'll send a resident.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.812
-They're just barely real doctors.
-This is a teaching hospital,

02:25.895 --> 02:27.522
the residents are very qualified.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.649
Good morning.
I'm Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.484
Real doctor, by the way.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.070
KIT: Conrad, thank God.
This is my son-in-law, Derek.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.157
I've been trying to get him
to see a doctor for a month now.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.700
He's been complaining
of shortness of breath.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.577
Mom. Let Derek speak for himself.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.036
And my daughter, Molly.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.997
Uh, it started a few weeks ago.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.373
It's probably just a little cough.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.834
Uh, he's had night sweats and fatigue.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.086
What if he has eosinophilic granulomatosis

02:50.170 --> 02:52.213
-with polyangiitis?
-Molly's in her second year of med school.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.924
Oh, doctors raising doctors.
I love it.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.968
Now, how about I take a look at Derek

02:57.051 --> 02:59.262
and everyone else heads to the cafeteria.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.389
And for this one, insider tip:

03:01.472 --> 03:04.017
order the hot chocolate,
extra marshmallows.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.602
Hot chocolate?

03:05.685 --> 03:07.228
Fantastic idea.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.938
Cocoa on me. Come on, you.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.406
DEREK:
Smooth move, doc.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.991
Deep breath.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.705
(coughs)

03:25.788 --> 03:27.498
They always like that together?

03:27.582 --> 03:30.793
Uh, well, Molly can get a little nervous.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.420
And you're the eye of the hurricane?

03:32.503 --> 03:33.421
I try.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.423
But I'm-I'm pulling double duty,

03:35.506 --> 03:37.675
what with Molly in med school and all.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.844
Working and taking care of the kid.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.804
I'm even coaching
her softball team this year.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.640
I get it, you're super dad.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.684
-(chuckles)
-That kind of stress can take its toll.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.645
Molly stayed home when Josie was a baby,

03:48.728 --> 03:50.647
so I figure it's my turn now.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.648
Okay.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.275
Well, my job is to focus on you.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.944
So, let's get a chest X-ray

03:56.027 --> 03:58.655
and find out what's going on, okay?

03:58.738 --> 04:00.490
Okay, yeah.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.866
I guess that's why I'm here.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.244
You're in the right place.
(chuckles)

04:04.327 --> 04:06.579
(coughing)

04:06.663 --> 04:07.956
(indistinct chatter)

04:08.039 --> 04:10.500
Randolph, you've done really
well with these guest spots.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.960
I'm happy.
Producers are happy.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.420
So now it's time
to knock it out of the park.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.797
Got any last-minute pointers?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.591
Make the show your own.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.554
Not an ounce of sugar goes into my body.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.183
I-I've been tired all the time,
uh, muscle ache.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.060
Now my gums have started bleeding.

04:29.143 --> 04:32.063
-Would you mind if I have a look?
-Sure.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.151
(audience groaning)

04:37.235 --> 04:39.404
Well...

04:39.487 --> 04:43.241
Albert, have you ever heard of
Dr. James Lind?

04:43.324 --> 04:47.203
-No.
-Lind was an 18th century surgeon's mate

04:47.287 --> 04:48.538
in the British Royal Navy.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.958
And at sea, they had a diet
a lot like yours.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.627
And that was back in the day
when more sailors were lost

04:54.711 --> 04:58.214
to a mysterious illness than to any enemy.

04:58.298 --> 05:02.135
And ships' captains were
prescribing vinegar and cider,

05:02.218 --> 05:05.722
and even sea water, until

05:05.805 --> 05:10.560
James Lind discovered that...

05:10.643 --> 05:12.395
(audience murmuring)

05:14.897 --> 05:18.109
...with just a little bit

05:18.192 --> 05:20.403
-of Vitamin C...
-AUDIENCE: Ooh...

05:20.486 --> 05:24.157
...he could cure thousands
of what I'm about to cure you of.

05:27.994 --> 05:28.953
Scurvy.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.621
(gasping, cheering)

05:32.123 --> 05:34.751
So, save your money,
throw away your home remedies,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.753
put a little citrus in your diet,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.755
or buy a peg leg.
It's up to you.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.131
(applause)

05:40.214 --> 05:41.257
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Need a doctor?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.218
Ring the Bell.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.472
(audience chanting):
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!

05:47.555 --> 05:50.933
Ring the Bell!
Ring the Bell!

05:51.017 --> 05:55.063
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!
Ring the Bell!

06:07.533 --> 06:09.285
Hey, I got your page, what's up?

06:09.369 --> 06:12.705
Remember Dr. Cain's patient
who was on The Montel Williams Show?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.332
Yeah.
I thought she was in rehab.

06:14.415 --> 06:17.293
According to her chart, she is.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.088
-She's been at an LTACH this whole time?
-Yes.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.090
And what's worse,
she's been hauled back to Chastain

06:22.173 --> 06:25.802
for treatment five times.
Strokes, pneumonias, infections.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.178
She's not getting better,

06:27.261 --> 06:29.389
but Cain wants her diagnosed, treated,

06:29.472 --> 06:31.057
and sent back to the LTACH.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.101
What I want is for Dawn Long to get better

06:33.184 --> 06:35.853
so her children
can have their mother back.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.731
-How's she doing?
-Not good.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.733
Fever. Increased sputum.
Hypoxia.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.819
All signs point to lower
respiratory tract infection.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.821
She's such a good woman.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.864
And her family...

06:46.948 --> 06:48.282
-so wonderful.
-Dr. Cain,

06:48.366 --> 06:51.369
are her children aware that
she's not gonna be waking up?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.205
Absolutely not.
Because we don't know that for sure yet.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.416
The brain is an enigma.
Anything can happen.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.418
Of course, but...

06:58.501 --> 07:00.086
I mean, it's been six months.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.046
Doesn't look like it's heading
in the right direction.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.090
Has it really been six months?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.387
You want your patient to wake up,

07:09.470 --> 07:10.638
you want it so badly,

07:10.721 --> 07:13.182
you just hold out hope.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.725
Maybe you're right.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.603
Maybe I haven't been
completely honest with myself

07:17.687 --> 07:19.147
or with her family.

07:20.898 --> 07:24.652
It's time we let this poor woman
pass peacefully.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.446
In the meantime, I need you two to

07:26.529 --> 07:27.947
do everything you can to keep her alive

07:28.030 --> 07:30.199
until I can get her family in here.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.161
Those children deserve one last
moment with their mother.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.246
Can you do that for me, please?

07:35.329 --> 07:36.789
Sure thing, Dr. Cain.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.666
Thank you.

07:44.797 --> 07:45.965
I did not expect that.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.009
(sighs) Let's hope
we don't have to put her through

07:48.092 --> 07:50.136
any more than we already have.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.682
DEREK:
Wow, honey, nice.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.435
Okay, Derek, your X-rays are up.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.020
We're gonna take a look at
what's going on in your lungs.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.481
Oh, I thought maybe
we should put mesothelioma

08:01.564 --> 08:03.024
at the top of Derek's differential.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.275
His office is old.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.027
Might have asbestos.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.403
CONRAD:
Well, he's young for mesothelioma.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.655
But old office,

08:09.739 --> 08:11.157
I'll keep that in mind.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.617
Let Conrad be the doctor, darling.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.917
Okay.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.963
See this white area on your X-ray?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.883
That means your right lung
is filled with something.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.176
Could be fluid.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.762
If it is, we'll drain it, run a CT

08:32.845 --> 08:34.764
and see what's causing all the trouble.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.474
-And reevaluate from there.
-MOLLY: How bad is it?

08:36.557 --> 08:37.642
The fluid, I mean.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.230
-Well...
-It's not a big deal at all.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.315
Right, Dr. Hawkins?

08:46.567 --> 08:47.735
Kit.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.746
Whiteout of the right hemithorax
is absolutely a big deal.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.415
I know, but I had to stop you.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.042
Molly does not handle stress well.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.253
-In fact, she utterly falls apart.
-Well, she's worried.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.255
-That's to be expected.
-Trust me.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.881
Her freshman year of college

09:08.965 --> 09:10.841
she had so much anxiety

09:10.925 --> 09:13.386
she had to drop out and live at home.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.221
Did you see her clawing at her wrists?

09:15.304 --> 09:16.722
-Mm-hmm.
-That's a tell.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.474
She's about to go into a tailspin.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.435
Still...

09:21.519 --> 09:23.020
there are a number of things

09:23.104 --> 09:24.397
that could be wrong with your son-in-law.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.399
I can't...

09:26.482 --> 09:28.401
I can't withhold information
from a patient.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.279
Of course.
And I would never ask you to do that.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.864
Derek is the patient
and you can tell him anything,

09:33.948 --> 09:35.825
'cause he can handle anything.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.493
But if any bad news is coming,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.745
could you please filter it through me?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.789
I will try to tell you any news first,

09:41.872 --> 09:43.666
so that you can be the Molly whisperer.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.667
Thank you.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.751
You're lucky I like you.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.753
It's the accent.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.053
PIERCE:
Executives are coming in tomorrow.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.514
We're gonna be selling
"Ring the Bell" T-shirts by Friday.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.057
Y-Yeah.
About that catchphrase...

10:00.141 --> 10:01.517
Hey, it's great, huh?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.519
We paid that woman to start the chant.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.522
Just get the audience riled up.
Worked like a charm.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.816
-Yep. Yeah. Loved it.
-(chuckles)

10:08.899 --> 10:11.444
So, listen, let's
go by the production office

10:11.527 --> 10:13.946
-and you can weigh in on tomorrow's guest.
-Oh, well, I can't.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.615
I have a shift at Chastain.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.199
(indistinct crew chatter)

10:17.283 --> 10:18.868
MAN:
Yeah, those are good where they are.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.746
You do realize that
if you take over this show,

10:21.829 --> 10:23.789
you're gonna have to cut back

10:23.873 --> 10:27.001
-your surgical schedule drastically.
-Well, that may be an issue.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.419
I'm already pushing it at Chastain.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.713
I really can't take
much more time off as it is.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.215
-I am a doctor, you know.
-Yes, you are a doctor.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.508
A TV doctor.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.427
Which is not a part-time job.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.893
What's the point of having
a famous doctor on staff

10:43.976 --> 10:46.270
if he's not available?
Man, you got to make that shot!

10:46.354 --> 10:48.731
I know you originally scheduled
this with Dr. Bell, Mr. Landry,

10:48.814 --> 10:51.734
but right now he's very busy
outside of the hospital.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.736
-(scoffs)
-You requested a top surgeon, right?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.656
-Right.
-Dr. Austin is our finest.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.700
Dr. Hawkins is too kind,
yet remarkably accurate.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.327
LANDRY:
I know you're good.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.205
You saved my star rookie.
That's him right there.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.249
See that dribble?
It's thanks to you he can still do that.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.669
(grunts)
But I've been

11:09.752 --> 11:11.545
-in and out of surgeries for a decade.
-Yep, you had

11:11.629 --> 11:13.047
that appendectomy back in '09,

11:13.130 --> 11:15.383
which led to a post-op infection.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.967
Which led to recurrent bowel obstruction

11:17.051 --> 11:18.844
and small bowel resection.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.598
Every time I lose intestine...
my dinner plate shrinks.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.809
I just want to break this cycle
once and for all.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.268
And we are gonna make that happen for you.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.813
This operation is extremely delicate.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.690
But I am precise and I have the patience

11:30.773 --> 11:33.150
of a western diamondback rattlesnake.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.154
Rattlesnakes are patient.
Come on, fellas.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.199
(chuckles)
Okay.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.826
Okay, you cut me open.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.869
Just do your best
to make it the last time.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
Best is my only mode, Mr. Landry.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.708
-See you soon.
-Thank you, guys.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.295
Oh, that's a handball!

11:53.379 --> 11:55.297
(door opens)

11:56.340 --> 11:58.259
Huh.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.595
I wonder where Molly
gets her scratching habit from.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.642
You see how wound up
my daughter is now?

12:06.726 --> 12:10.062
You should have seen her
before Derek came along.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.773
I'm not sure what we'd do without him.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.942
Mm. Let's not go there.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.444
(beeping)

12:22.366 --> 12:25.202
Derek has a mass in his chest.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.005
Ring the Bell.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.091
Aw, you got a case of the scurvy, matey.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.051
Let's-let's just not do that.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.970
Ah, where's the Hollywood smile?

12:43.053 --> 12:44.972
I loved the whole schtick.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.974
It's not a schtick.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.560
It's medicine, only on TV.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.771
(chuckles):
Right.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.898
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.858
I have a gallbladder removal.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.568
Oh, uh, we-we weren't sure
if you were coming back today,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.069
so they moved that up the schedule

12:59.153 --> 13:00.362
and I covered that for you.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.366
We... You were off doing your thing.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.162
Which is definitely not a schtick.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.211
(sighs)
Yeah.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.213
Full day.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.006
I got to jet.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.759
KIM:
Hey.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.553
I just got a readmissions alert
in my e-mail.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.555
Why is Dawn Long back in this hospital?

13:26.639 --> 13:30.142
-She's sick.
-Is that supposed to be a joke?

13:30.226 --> 13:33.604
She's been back here five times
since her operation.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.606
Her treatment costs
are beginning to add up.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.150
You're supposed to be making us money,
not costing us.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.946
The woman is comatose.
Why are we not letting her die?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.948
We will.
Tomorrow.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.783
(sniffles)

13:45.866 --> 13:47.451
Care to elaborate?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.662
After six months,
Dawn Long's survival statistics

13:49.745 --> 13:52.498
will no longer be tracked, and our famous

13:52.581 --> 13:56.252
Mother of all Surgeries
will have an official survivor.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.878
It's one for the record books.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.881
-And that six month mark...
-Is tomorrow.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.134
She lives through the night,
then all of the publicity

14:04.218 --> 14:06.220
we got from that surgery
will not go to waste.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.639
We just need to keep her breathing
until the morning.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.140
And the family is on board for that?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.851
They will be.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.020
Okay.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.232
One more day, then end this charade.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.112
Question.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.281
Why is she so sick?

14:25.364 --> 14:28.534
She's bedridden, on a vent,
decrease in swallowing function.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.161
All adds up to pneumonia.
Very common.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.496
Are you sure?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.374
It's pneumonia.
Trust me.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.387
A mass?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.599
-What kind of mass?
-We're not sure yet.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.809
Is there a chance
he'll have to stay overnight?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.436
We've got softball tomorrow, Dad.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.770
I know, honey.
Don't worry.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.022
We're just gonna do a biopsy.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.773
It's a quick procedure in the OR.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.192
But you must have some idea
what the mass is.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.986
There's no point in speculating.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.240
Yeah, let's just
wait for the biopsy results

15:08.324 --> 15:09.992
before jumping to any conclusions.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.828
A nurse will prep you in a few minutes.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.168
I'll be watching the entire time.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.424
Mom.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.967
What are you hiding?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.719
-Pardon?
-I saw how you stopped

15:28.802 --> 15:30.512
Dr. Hawkins from talking earlier.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.848
You're not fooling me.
I know how you get when you're worried.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.683
My husband has a mass in his chest.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.227
It's perfectly rational for me
to look for answers.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.229
Why don't you take Josie and grab a bite?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.649
-The biopsy won't take long.
-Josie's coloring. She's fine.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.818
Mom, quit sidelining me.
I'm not 18 anymore.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.112
I can handle whatever it is
you're worried about.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.199
I'm not worried about anything.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.910
Everything is gonna be okay.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.418
Retractor.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.300
(door closes)

16:08.384 --> 16:09.885
KIT:
Molly's nerves are sky high,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.887
and mine are catching up.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.849
We need something to go smoothly today.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.851
Thank you for being here, Conrad.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.438
Well, you're family.
Of course.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.983
Thank you for taking this, AJ.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.652
AUSTIN:
Anything for you, Dr. V.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.948
Dissecting down to the mediastinum.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.910
Scope to me.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.539
Passing the scope anterior

16:38.622 --> 16:39.957
to the trachea.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.502
Identifying my landmarks.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.795
Uh...

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
All good down there?

16:50.509 --> 16:53.595
I'm flush against the pulmonary artery.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.014
How close is it?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.100
Biopsy forceps.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.856
KIT:
Oh, please, don't nick that artery.

17:03.939 --> 17:04.940
He won't.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.027
AUSTIN:
And...

17:09.653 --> 17:11.530
-...fin.
-He didn't.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.868
AUSTIN:
Let's get this little nugget

17:15.951 --> 17:17.619
to the lab, shall we?

17:19.913 --> 17:22.166
And now we wait for the pathology report.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.045
I hate this part.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.886
Mr. Kim.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.888
Welcome back, Dr. Bell.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.099
Can I help you?
(chuckles)

17:39.183 --> 17:41.518
I'm just gonna take
a wild guess and assume

17:41.602 --> 17:43.896
you're behind my removal
from the surgical schedule.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.441
That's what you wanted, right?

17:47.524 --> 17:50.027
Why would that be what I wanted?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.738
From what I hear,
you've been AWOL for weeks,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.573
working your second job.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.868
My second job? I'm on a TV show
bringing publicity to Chastain.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.037
And if a surgery
has to be handed off to an alternate

18:00.120 --> 18:02.581
once in a blue moon, it's a small price

18:02.664 --> 18:05.209
-to keep a top surgeon around.
-Is that what you are?

18:06.877 --> 18:08.420
We all pass our prime,

18:08.504 --> 18:12.341
but we don't all retire
into fame and fortune.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.427
Maybe don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.388
I see you're having trouble understanding.
I'll simplify.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.058
You lose me, you lose more than a surgeon.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.393
I know you'd love any reason
to get rid of me, but trust me,

18:23.477 --> 18:26.021
you want me cutting and you want me happy.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.148
Don't be dramatic, Dr. Bell.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.567
I don't want you gone.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.403
I just don't care if you're here.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.866
Feldman.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.328
-Got your page.
-Dr. Bell.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.205
I didn't expect it to be you.
I just asked

18:43.288 --> 18:44.915
for any available general surgeon.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.459
Well, I'm between patients at the moment.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.086
What's the problem?

18:49.169 --> 18:52.131
Well, uh... follow me.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
Uh...

18:58.595 --> 19:00.681
Perirectal abscess.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.936
You expect me to lance a boil
on a patient's ass?

19:06.019 --> 19:07.938
It's too close to the rectal
muscle for me to do it.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.191
Rules dictate a general surgeon drains it.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.694
Sorry.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.587
-(gasps)
-Good afternoon, Nurse.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.505
Have Pravesh and Nevin
learned anything about Ms. Long?

19:33.589 --> 19:34.923
Uh, not yet.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.925
Her prelim cultures are negative,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.927
but her BP has hardly improved.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.554
Okay, let's open up the box.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.098
Order fungal markers,
MALDI-TOF, the whole gamut.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.893
Uh, what are we testing for?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.061
Everything.
Uh, you know, I just want to be thorough.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.647
Okay.
I'll have Dr. Pravesh put in those orders.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.649
Nurse...

19:53.901 --> 19:56.862
...this case is deeply personal to me.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.406
I brought Dawn Long into Chastain.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.074
I was her surgeon.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.743
I held her children's hands
through the post-op.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.747
I am gonna be the last person
to leave her funeral.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.374
I put her care entirely on my shoulders,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.835
and I'm gonna continue
to do so moving forward,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.587
because...

20:13.670 --> 20:15.881
I am her doctor.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.384
Nobody else.
Am I making myself clear?

20:20.510 --> 20:21.720
-Absolutely.
-You're gonna order

20:21.803 --> 20:23.305
that fungal culture under my name.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.182
And who are you gonna send the results to?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.017
-You, Dr. Cain.
-Anybody else?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.227
No.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.312
Attagirl.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.995
AUSTIN:
Dr. Bell.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.622
To what do I owe this pleasure?

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
I heard you're operating
on Bill Landry today.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.793
I am. 5:00 p.m. sharp.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.503
Don't you love punctuality?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.215
-Need an extra hand?
-I do not.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.217
I'm free at 5:00 p.m.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.927
Excellent.
I've got some book recommendations.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.846
-I've done a lot of bowel resections.
-As have I.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.473
AJ, come on, man.
I'm going stir-crazy.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.808
My whole schedule's
been cleared for the day.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.102
Right, so you could be on television.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.230
-Wow. You, too. Okay.
-I'll tell you what.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.315
I will keep you in mind for surgery.
All right?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.484
-(sighs)
-And if I do need you,

21:17.567 --> 21:20.529
-I will make sure to ring the...
-Don't.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.905
-Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
-Don't...

21:21.989 --> 21:24.116
-(laughs)
-(sighs)

21:41.466 --> 21:45.304
Derek has an aggressive B-cell lymphoma.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.731
I'm so sorry, Kit.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.691
From here on in,

21:57.774 --> 22:00.736
there are two parts to a patient's life.

22:00.819 --> 22:04.114
Before you know you have cancer
and after you know.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.866
Right now, they're in Derek's room

22:05.949 --> 22:08.994
living in the before.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.289
I heard them planning tomorrow's dinner.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.124
Brainstorming vacations

22:14.207 --> 22:17.002
for after Molly's school is finished.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.503
But you and I--

22:18.587 --> 22:21.131
we're already living in the after,

22:21.214 --> 22:23.550
where you don't plan vacations,
where you know everything

22:23.633 --> 22:25.260
is not gonna be okay

22:25.344 --> 22:28.055
for a very long time, if ever.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.265
And we must drag them
into the after with us,

22:30.349 --> 22:33.268
and that is a terrible,
terrible thing to do.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.270
I could tell them for you.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.689
No. No.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.400
This is my family.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.027
They're gonna remember
these words forever,

22:42.110 --> 22:45.739
and they must come from me.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.908
Cancer?

22:47.991 --> 22:50.369
Mommy, what's the matter?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.705
-Daddy?
-It's all right, honey.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.707
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.751
Kit, can you

22:57.834 --> 22:58.794
please have someone

22:58.877 --> 23:00.670
take Josie to the play area?

23:00.754 --> 23:01.963
Of course.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.882
-I don't want to go.
-I know, sweetie.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.469
It's just, it's, uh,
it's grown-up time right now.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.554
It's fine.
(sniffles)

23:17.187 --> 23:19.856
Oh.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.566
Thank you, honey.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.534
What's next?

23:32.828 --> 23:36.581
The oncologist, Dr. Jones,
will be in to talk to you soon.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.960
He's a specialist
in this type of lymphoma.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.087
What are the chances of me
getting out of this alive?

23:42.170 --> 23:43.964
It's survivable.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.050
How survivable?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.805
Dr. Hawkins.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.307
I have a daughter...

23:54.391 --> 23:56.017
and I have a wife to think about.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.561
I need to know if we should
start making plans,

23:57.644 --> 24:00.856
so please, just lay it out for me.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.274
There's still a lot we don't know.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.026
The chemo is called R-CHOP,
and it is not easy.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.404
It'll make you feel tired, nauseous.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.614
Your white blood cell counts will drop,

24:09.698 --> 24:11.032
it could cause an infection.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.742
But when you make it through that...

24:12.826 --> 24:15.537
Please.
What are my chances?

24:16.830 --> 24:19.166
You have a 50% chance at being cured.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.042
(Molly crying)

24:22.252 --> 24:23.462
Molly.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.923
DEREK:
It's okay. Just...

24:27.007 --> 24:29.885
just give her a minute.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.357
I asked you to let me handle this.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.943
Molly had ten seconds to process
her husband's lymphoma,

24:47.027 --> 24:48.695
and you're discussing survival rates.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.698
I know.
But he was desperate and he asked me,

24:51.781 --> 24:54.201
so I had to honor that.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.286
(elevator bell chimes)

25:00.040 --> 25:01.750
We had a deal.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.668
You said you would funnel
everything through me,

25:03.752 --> 25:05.962
that I would tell them,
I would soften the blow.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.797
But you didn't.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.967
And now look what happened.
You told them he could die.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.678
You made it worse, Conrad.
You made it so much worse.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.472
(exhales)
I understand.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.641
You're not mad at me.
You're mad at cancer.

25:17.724 --> 25:20.060
You're scared for Derek.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.854
You're scared Molly will
fall apart, or that you will.

25:22.938 --> 25:26.483
I know.
I'm sorry.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.985
But that poor man.
That poor, darling man,

25:29.069 --> 25:31.112
-he doesn't deserve this.
-No, he doesn't.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.115
No one does.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.743
But you and I--

25:36.826 --> 25:39.120
we're gonna do everything we can.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.957
And when we're done,
I know you will be strong enough

25:42.040 --> 25:44.459
to put yourself
and everyone else back together.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.256
Okay.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.174
(sniffles)
Thank you.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.552
-I'm fine.
-I know you are.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.764
And for the record,

25:57.847 --> 26:01.142
I absolutely can be mad at cancer and you.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.686
(soft chuckle)

26:18.702 --> 26:21.246
I gave her 0.5 of lorazepam,
but it didn't work.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.372
And I-I didn't know what to do.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.790
She's been seizing for nearly a minute.

26:23.873 --> 26:24.916
All right, give her
another two milligrams.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.084
Turn her up to 100% O2.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.050
Okay.
She's settling.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.222
-She's in V tach.
-Get the crash cart, pull up 300 of amio.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.766
DEVON:
We're gonna save this woman's life

26:41.850 --> 26:42.851
just so she can die again

26:42.934 --> 26:44.227
when the family pulls the plug.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.271
If they pull the plug.
She's not DNR. We have to save her.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.355
It's not right.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.523
I know, Devon,
but we don't have a choice.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.400
(sighs)
We're torturing her.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.694
(monitor beeps)

26:55.363 --> 26:57.365
She's coding.
We have to bag her.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.829
All right.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.634
-I'm sorry.
-No, Molly...

27:15.717 --> 27:19.012
I ran out of the room
just when Derek needed me most.

27:19.095 --> 27:20.847
I was thinking of myself.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.266
I fell apart when
I should have been strong.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.268
That's all I ever do.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.269
And that's why you're telling doctors

27:26.353 --> 27:27.520
not to talk in front of me.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.939
Letting my sick husband
hear about his condition,

27:30.023 --> 27:32.859
but not his totally healthy,
medically trained,

27:32.942 --> 27:34.653
"should be able to handle it" wife.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.946
I'm proud of you.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.616
I know sometimes I try to protect you

27:39.699 --> 27:42.952
like you're still a kid,
but that's my mistake.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.245
Look at you.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.583
You're in your second year
of med school, top of your class.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.794
You have a wonderful child,
a strong marriage

27:50.877 --> 27:53.672
and I am endlessly proud of you.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.510
Sometimes I think,
without him, I couldn't breathe.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.889
He's my rock.

28:02.972 --> 28:06.434
You may not see this,
but you're his rock, too.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.987
AUSTIN: All right, Chu.
We're looking at an hour or less

28:18.071 --> 28:20.532
-with Mr. Landry here.
-CHU: Roger that.

28:20.615 --> 28:21.950
AUSTIN:
10 blade to me.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.577
All right.
Let's give this team owner

28:24.661 --> 28:26.788
a new lease on life, shall we?

28:31.126 --> 28:34.170
Uh, all right, Chu,
let's make it 90 minutes.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.006
There's a country mile
of scar tissue in this bad boy.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.675
CHU:
90 minutes. Got it.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.303
AUSTIN:
Retractor.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.434
Make that two hours.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.938
Uh, in fact, you know what?
Make it four.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.524
It's like tissue paper in here.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.234
You know, I'm gonna need
another set of hands.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.485
I'll page Dr. Singh.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.488
Actually... make it Dr. Bell.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.032
-Bell? Is he still full-time here?
-(chuckles)

29:03.116 --> 29:05.660
Check the cafeteria.
And when you find him, tell him

29:05.744 --> 29:06.953
not to let it get to his head,

29:07.036 --> 29:09.748
but I need him in my OR, stat.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.502
(sighs)
Hey.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.174
You okay?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.801
Well, I just saved
a woman's life. A woman who,

29:21.885 --> 29:24.471
by all rights, should be long dead, so...

29:24.554 --> 29:27.056
Anyway, you paged.
What's up?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.476
Told Dr. Voss that
you used to be a chemo nurse,

29:29.559 --> 29:30.894
and that you were great at it.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.604
The best, is what I actually said.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.230
(sighs)

29:34.314 --> 29:35.899
We fill the patient with toxins

29:35.982 --> 29:37.650
and hope it only kills the bad stuff.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.652
-It's hell on them.
-I know.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.696
And it can take its toll on you, as well.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.490
Yeah, I mean, the oncologists,
they just give the orders.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.159
The nurses stay with the patients,
watch them struggle.

29:46.242 --> 29:49.370
It's... it's heartbreaking.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.914
You don't have to do it.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.916
No, it's okay.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.795
For Kit, her family, anything.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.172
How about we get a family member
to sit with you,

29:59.255 --> 30:01.382
track how you feel?

30:01.466 --> 30:02.884
That way you don't
have to spend extra energy

30:02.967 --> 30:04.093
communicating with the nurses.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.054
MOLLY:
That would be me.

30:06.137 --> 30:09.098
Sorry I'm late.
The vending machine line was crazy.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.602
I read snacks are important
during chemo sessions.

30:12.685 --> 30:16.523
-Sweet or salty? Sweet.
-(Derek chuckles)

30:17.565 --> 30:19.692
Are you comfortable?

30:19.776 --> 30:22.320
I-I ordered pillows.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.489
I'm good.
Really.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.115
I know you are.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.660
You're always good.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.287
In fact, you're the bravest
person I've ever met.

30:31.371 --> 30:34.624
But today, you focus on getting better,

30:34.707 --> 30:36.584
and I'll handle the rest.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.635
(quietly):
Come here. It's okay.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.928
It's okay.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.060
(quietly):
It's okay.

30:54.143 --> 30:56.646
-Come here. I know.
-(crying)

30:56.729 --> 30:58.064
-I'm so sorry.
-I know...

31:00.525 --> 31:03.027
MOLLY:
We got this, okay?

31:03.111 --> 31:04.946
I promise.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.377
I love unicorns.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.756
What's going on with Mom?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.592
CAIN:
Do you mind if, um,

31:25.675 --> 31:29.304
-just you and I talk?
-Of course, yeah.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.098
I'll meet you guys
in the waiting room, okay?

31:32.181 --> 31:33.391
Waiting room, okay?

31:36.978 --> 31:40.523
I don't know exactly
how to say this to you, but...

31:40.607 --> 31:43.151
your mother, she's...

31:43.234 --> 31:45.904
she's not really there anymore.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.031
What do you mean?

31:49.073 --> 31:50.325
We haven't measured any type

31:50.408 --> 31:52.118
of meaningful brain activity,

31:52.201 --> 31:54.913
and we haven't for some time now.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.749
Now, I know that we were
holding out hope for a miracle.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.835
I truly, truly believed
that it was gonna happen.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.213
But the chances
are getting slimmer by the day.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.178
You think we should let her go?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.430
Your mother's fought a good fight.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.641
And we all love her.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.726
We did our best to heal her, but...

32:18.728 --> 32:20.813
...yes, it's time.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.275
Um...

32:25.526 --> 32:26.611
How would it happen?

32:26.694 --> 32:27.946
Would you just...

32:28.029 --> 32:30.239
turn off all her machines?

32:30.323 --> 32:32.450
Yes, we'd make sure she's comfortable.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.578
We'll give her some morphine,
so she doesn't feel any pain.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.288
You can have a ceremony
right here in the room.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.332
Just the family.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.128
Can I arrange that for you?

32:54.847 --> 32:56.849
Okay.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.231
Done and done.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.113
What made you change your mind?

33:10.196 --> 33:11.489
(Austin chuckles)

33:11.572 --> 33:13.741
Multiple previous abdominal surgeries.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.618
There's scar tissue everywhere, man.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.245
I can barely lyse the adhesions

33:17.328 --> 33:20.415
without tearing into the intestines.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.793
This is a mess.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.128
Tell me about it.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.340
This could take till daybreak, you know?

33:30.633 --> 33:33.136
You got someplace to be?

33:33.219 --> 33:34.595
I'm a surgeon.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.930
Where would I have to be?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.475
Retractor to me.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.689
Uh, Nic, I think he's shivering.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.150
Well, that's normal with chemo.
Here.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.735
(monitor beeping rapidly)

33:48.818 --> 33:50.528
Are his Ts peaking?

33:50.611 --> 33:51.988
Let me print an EKG.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.698
And get Conrad in here.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.909
We're just checking with the doctor.

33:56.993 --> 33:57.994
I'm sure you're fine.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.829
You're right-- good catch.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.331
Let's get a crash cart in here, come on!

34:02.415 --> 34:03.958
Push one gram of calcium gluconate.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.544
Derek, honey, it's gonna be fine--
I'm right here.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.838
Derek wasn't shivering, he's twitching.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.214
CONRAD:
He must be hypocalcemic.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.341
And with his high potassium,
he's in danger

34:12.425 --> 34:13.926
of cardiac arrest.
He's in TLS.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.678
Let's get the pacer pads on him now.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.389
Give him ten units of insulin,
an amp of D-50

34:18.473 --> 34:21.601
-and an amp of bicarb.
-NIC: Derek has tumor lysis syndrome.

34:21.684 --> 34:24.103
As the chemo kills his cancer cells...

34:24.187 --> 34:25.980
Dying cells release toxins
into his blood and organs.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.690
In other words,

34:27.774 --> 34:29.192
the cure could kill him.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.278
So we have a catch-22.
Before his first

34:32.361 --> 34:34.113
round of chemo's complete,
we need to give him

34:34.197 --> 34:36.407
fluids in order to prevent
his kidneys from failing.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.618
But doing that puts his lungs

34:38.701 --> 34:40.286
in danger of filling with fluid again.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.413
It's gonna be touch-and-go till sunrise.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.499
Okay.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.015
Man, I thought we'd lost him
when that tear

36:24.098 --> 36:26.767
in his IVC opened up, but your patchwork

36:26.851 --> 36:28.227
using peritoneum?

36:28.311 --> 36:30.021
Good work, my brother.

36:30.104 --> 36:33.983
Can you imagine if we killed the owner
of Atlanta's soccer team?

36:34.066 --> 36:36.068
We'd be run out of Georgia.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.614
Listen, man, my apologies
about the surprise marathon.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.325
But if it wasn't for you,
old Landry would be spending

36:42.408 --> 36:44.202
the rest of his life
drinking his meals through straws.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.620
There's no apologies necessary.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.247
I, you know...

36:48.331 --> 36:51.834
I haven't pushed myself
that hard in... years.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.086
Just exhausting.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.172
But exhilarating.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.550
I got to go.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.970
Oh, so you're really gonna
walk away from all this, huh?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.014
This is who I am.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.475
I'm a surgeon-- it doesn't mean
we're one-trick ponies, AJ.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.976
With a show I can reach more people.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.603
I can do a lot of good, I...

37:10.686 --> 37:12.230
And yet here you are,

37:12.313 --> 37:14.774
after a brutal surgery like this one,

37:14.857 --> 37:17.652
glowing like an intern

37:17.735 --> 37:19.695
on his first day of rotation.

37:24.158 --> 37:26.160
(laughs)

37:39.757 --> 37:41.217
He's been up and down all night.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.136
Didn't eat, he said he was cold.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.056
Dr. Hawkins told me you caught
Derek's potassium spike.

37:47.139 --> 37:50.768
You know, you might have saved his life.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.144
We'll see.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.146
(footsteps approaching)

37:54.230 --> 37:56.816
He's afebrile. Um...

37:56.899 --> 37:57.984
BP looks good.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.945
Electrolytes are stabilized.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.199
He made it through
his first round of chemo.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.826
(laughing softly)

38:14.458 --> 38:17.545
(applause, cheering)

38:20.047 --> 38:22.049
BELL:
Ah!

38:24.385 --> 38:26.887
Good morning!

38:26.971 --> 38:29.724
Good morning, good morning.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.059
Uh, sorry if I look a little ragged.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.687
I had a... big night last night.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.606
Uh, we performed an unexpected

38:37.690 --> 38:39.233
overnight surgery.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.029
The patient had a dozen bowel obstructions

38:43.112 --> 38:46.407
over the years,
and every time he went in for a repair,

38:46.490 --> 38:49.285
he lost a little bit of his intestine.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.454
Before I bring out
our-our scheduled guest,

38:51.537 --> 38:53.497
I-I'd like you to meet that patient.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.833
So please say hello to the owner

38:55.916 --> 38:57.626
of the Georgia FC Soccer Club,

38:57.710 --> 38:59.211
Bill Landry.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.339
(cheering)

39:05.968 --> 39:09.013
Bill, how are you feeling?

39:09.096 --> 39:11.265
-Any soreness, nausea?
-Yeah.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.351
A little pain around my stitches.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.269
Still pretty tuckered out.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.063
Well, that's, as we discussed,

39:17.146 --> 39:19.899
because your intestine ruptured,

39:19.982 --> 39:22.943
and you were open all night
while we repaired it.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.737
You'll be back watching Georgia FC

39:24.820 --> 39:26.405
with a beer and burgers in no time.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.158
Although I cannot recommend

39:29.241 --> 39:30.409
the burger.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.078
-(laughter)
-The beer...

39:32.161 --> 39:33.829
in moderation.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.290
Dr. Bell, I don't know how to thank you,

39:36.374 --> 39:38.334
but I'm sure gonna try.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.544
I'd like to offer you
and your audience members

39:40.628 --> 39:44.298
tickets to this week's match
against United FC.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.510
(cheering)

39:48.511 --> 39:50.179
Wow.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.056
They seem pretty happy, Bill.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.433
That's very generous, thank you so much.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.811
So that's what you'll get

39:56.894 --> 39:59.313
when you tune into The Dr. Bell Show.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.440
I will bring my hospital
into your living room.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.692
Real patients, real stories.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.488
Which only an actively working
doctor can bring you.

40:08.864 --> 40:12.493
And now, before we go to break...

40:14.078 --> 40:15.788
Mr. Landry?

40:15.871 --> 40:17.081
If you need a doctor,

40:17.164 --> 40:20.459
just ring the Bell!

40:20.543 --> 40:22.962
(laughter, applause)

40:23.045 --> 40:26.590
AUDIENCE (chanting):
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!

40:26.674 --> 40:29.343
Ring the Bell!
Ring the Bell!

40:29.427 --> 40:30.845
Ring the Bell!

40:30.928 --> 40:33.139
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!

40:33.222 --> 40:34.557
Ring the Bell!

40:34.640 --> 40:36.559
So, Dawn Long has passed on

40:36.642 --> 40:39.061
and the Mother of All Surgeries

40:39.145 --> 40:41.230
is now officially a success.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.190
(laughs)

40:43.274 --> 40:45.651
-Great work.
-(phone buzzing)

40:45.734 --> 40:47.069
I'll draft a press release.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.157
Yes, this is Dr. Cain.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.408
Dr. Cain,

40:52.491 --> 40:53.617
this is Dr. Vincent

40:53.701 --> 40:55.202
down in microbiology.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.954
I have Dawn Long's blood culture results.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.998
Ah, yes. Unfortunately,

40:59.081 --> 41:00.624
Dawn Long has passed away,
so there's no need.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.710
A-Actually, you're gonna
want to hear this.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.004
Your patient had Candida auris.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.548
The superbug?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.426
Exactly.
The hospital will have

41:10.509 --> 41:11.927
to lock down the patient room,

41:12.011 --> 41:13.721
sterilize it from top to bottom.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.473
Anybody who'd come into contact

41:15.556 --> 41:17.892
with Ms. Long will have
to take extreme precautions.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.810
Okay, thanks for the call.
I'll handle it.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.854
I-I don't need to remind you, Dr. Cain,

41:21.937 --> 41:24.773
but once Candida auris
spreads throughout a building,

41:24.857 --> 41:27.067
it's nearly impossible to eradicate.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.613
A superbug like this
can destroy a hospital.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.034
What is it?

41:35.117 --> 41:36.535
Hey.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.703
Barrett.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.802
Good morning, Dr. Cain.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.900
Logan.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.569
We have a problem.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.967
