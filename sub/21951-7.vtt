         ON THAT FIGHT.         

03:21.467 --> 03:23.669
    HE KNOWS THAT DANE          
     ISN'T AT THE SAME LEVEL    

03:23.736 --> 03:25.037
    AS MOST OF THE GUYS HERE.

    St. Pierre: DANE SAYERS,    
      FOR HIS FIRST FIGHT,      

03:28.208 --> 03:31.109
 HE DIDN'T SHOW A LOT OF SKILL, 
 BUT HE SHOWED A LOT OF HEART.  

03:31.177 --> 03:34.213
    SO I KNEW THAT WE WANTED    
TO MAKE HIM FIGHT THE LAST      

03:34.280 --> 03:36.448
     BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TIME     
        TO WORK WITH HIM        

03:36.516 --> 03:38.517

PSYCHO HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE     
    OVER DANE IN THIS FIGHT,

         SO I'M LOOKING         
  FOR BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG THINGS 

03:53.566 --> 03:55.033
  OUT OF PSYCHO IN THIS FIGHT.  

03:55.101 --> 03:57.769
  I EXPECT PSYCHO TO COME OUT,  
        THROW SOME BOMBS,       

03:57.837 --> 04:00.973
      DROP HIM ON HIS HEAD,

             KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

07:53.573 --> 07:54.873
    WHEN YOU'RE DUCKING DOWN,

OKAY.

          MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GO 
DOWN THERE, YOU'RE LOOKING UP   

07:58.077 --> 07:59.911
    BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
          LOOKING AT THE FLOOR. 

07:59.979 --> 08:01.780

                IN THE HEAD.    
     OKAY.

  YOU GOT TO THROW.

        St. Pierre:             
    SAKO IS A JUDO GUY.         

08:10.056 --> 08:12.457
  HE'S VERY GOOD ON THE FLOOR,  
     MUCH BETTER THAN DANE,     

08:12.525 --> 08:15.193
  BUT DANE IS THE MOST IMPROVED 
         GUY ON MY TEAM         

08:15.261 --> 08:17.229
     SINCE THE SEASON START.

 I'M TALKING ABOUT.

THE HEAVIEST HITTER OF THE TEAM,

08:24.537 --> 08:27.272
    SO IT'S QUITE SURPRISING.   

08:34.212 --> 08:35.614
      DANE HAS A GAME PLAN.     

08:35.681 --> 08:37.948
WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T WANT
    TO MAKE THIS FIGHT          

08:38.017 --> 08:39.551
     A VERY TECHNICAL FIGHT     
         ON THE GROUND.         

08:41.921 --> 08:43.688
 THE ODDS ARE NOT ON OUR FAVOR. 

08:43.756 --> 08:47.826
I BELIEVE THAT DANE CAN SURPRISE
    EVERYONE WITH A VICTORY.    

08:55.201 --> 08:58.103

     TO [BLEEP] TALK TO HIM,    

09:20.693 --> 09:22.160
SO HE'S PUSHING MY BUTTONS.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.668
     IT'S COOL.                 

10:36.736 --> 10:39.170
     MALE NURSE.                

10:39.238 --> 10:42.874
Koscheck: IT'S LIKE, "BRO,      
      YOU'RE A MALE NURSE.      

10:42.942 --> 10:44.009
     "YOU'RE NOT A FIGHTER.     

10:44.076 --> 10:45.977
 YOU SHOULDN'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH."

 I THINK THAT ONE GOT UNDER HIS 
  SKIN A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW?  

10:59.425 --> 11:02.394
    JUST A LITTLE BIT.          
  I THINK I WON THAT ONE TODAY. 

11:05.431 --> 11:07.399
        LET'S GO, PSYCHO!       

11:09.368 --> 11:10.835
        NICE WORK.              

11:10.903 --> 11:13.805
  Chivitchian: I GAVE MY WHOLE  
  LIFE SINCE I WAS 6 YEARS OLD  

11:13.873 --> 11:15.306
      TO THE SPORT OF JUDO.     

11:15.374 --> 11:17.042
     I WON NATIONAL CHAMPION    
        NINE TIME,              

11:17.109 --> 11:18.710
     TWO-TIME JUNIOR OLYMPIC    
            CHAMPION.           

11:18.778 --> 11:20.078
I WAS ON THE NATIONAL TEAM.     

11:20.146 --> 11:23.915
 I FOUGHT IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS
        IN KOREA IN 2002.       

11:23.983 --> 11:27.052
 SO I'VE -- YOU KNOW, I WENT UP 
 TO A WORLD-CLASS LEVEL IN JUDO.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.753
            LOOK AT MY RIGHT -- 
        LOOK AT MY LEFT FOOT.   

11:28.821 --> 11:29.788
          WHAT'S HE READY TO DO?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.289
SHOELACE.                       
            SHOELACE EVERY TIME.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.124
  Koscheck: HE'S NOT A TWO-TIME 
     OLYMPIAN FOR NO REASON.    

11:33.192 --> 11:34.893
            HE KNOWS            
    WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.    

11:34.960 --> 11:37.929
         Chivitchian:           
    I KNEW I COULDN'T MAKE      
TOO MUCH OF A LIVING DOING JUDO,

11:37.997 --> 11:41.900
 BUT ONCE MMA CAME ALONG, I KNEW
I HAD TO JUMP ON THAT BOAT.     

11:41.967 --> 11:44.169
 IT'S THE FASTEST-GROWING SPORT 
          IN THE WORLD.         

11:44.236 --> 11:46.471
            THERE YOU GO. ELBOW.
                    GOOD.       

11:46.539 --> 11:49.808
    THAT'S WHY MY DREAM         
     IS TO BE A UFC FIGHTER,    

11:49.875 --> 11:51.843
          AND I'M DOING         
    AND I'VE BEEN DOING         

11:51.911 --> 11:53.678
    EVERYTHING POSSIBLE         
          TO GET THERE.         

12:00.286 --> 12:02.253
Koscheck: I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU   
                LOOK SO GOOD.   

12:02.321 --> 12:03.888
              Man:              
     LOOKS REALLY GOOD, HUH?    

12:03.956 --> 12:05.824
              YEAH. LOOKS GREAT.
YOU LIKE THAT?                  

12:05.891 --> 12:07.659
          YEP. I WANT THAT.     
  UH-HUH.                       

12:07.727 --> 12:10.495
      PSYCHO, IN PRACTICE,      
     HAS BEEN LOOKING GREAT.    

12:10.563 --> 12:11.663
                    BOOM.       

12:11.731 --> 12:13.131
                    OKAY?       

12:13.199 --> 12:15.200
             AND IT'S GONNA CUT 
    RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THERE.   

12:15.267 --> 12:17.335
 THAT'S WHERE WE WANT -- WE JUST
    WANT IT TO BARELY GO WHOOP. 

12:17.403 --> 12:19.304
              AND THAT -- CUT.  

12:19.371 --> 12:21.473
        YES.                    

12:21.540 --> 12:23.641
     BEAUTIFUL.                 

12:23.709 --> 12:25.710
                     AH!        

12:25.778 --> 12:28.913
YOU HIT HIM WITH ONE OF THESE,  
  IT'S NIGHT-NIGHT.             

12:28.981 --> 12:29.948
        YES.                    

12:30.015 --> 12:31.049
        GOOD.                   

12:31.117 --> 12:32.617
    YOU KNOW, HE'S MOTIVATED.   

12:32.685 --> 12:34.652
      YOU COULD JUST SEE IT     
          IN HIS FACE.          

12:34.720 --> 12:37.422
YOU CAN SEE HIS EMOTIONS AND HOW
  BAD HE WANTS THIS OPPORTUNITY 

12:37.490 --> 12:38.957
        OF BECOMING             
THE NEXT ULTIMATE FIGHTER.      

12:40.226 --> 12:41.860
     BEAUTIFUL.                 

12:41.927 --> 12:44.829
 Chivitchian: I'VE BEEN THROUGH 
A LOT IN MY PERSONAL LIFE,      

12:44.897 --> 12:46.164
AND I'VE SACRIFICED A LOT,      

12:46.232 --> 12:48.032
  AND I'VE BEEN IN MARTIAL ARTS 
         MY WHOLE LIFE,         

12:48.100 --> 12:50.101
     SO IF ANYBODY DESERVES     
     TO BE HERE, IT IS ME.      

12:50.169 --> 12:53.671
 AND MY MAMA BROUGHT ME TO THIS 
WORLD TO WIN, AND I'M GONNA WIN.

12:53.739 --> 12:58.109
I USED TO DRINK, PARTY,         
AND I WASN'T TAKING IT SERIOUS. 

12:58.177 --> 13:00.979
I WAS YOUNG. I DIDN'T THINK     
ABOUT EVERYTHING TWICE.         

13:01.046 --> 13:02.213
      YOU KNOW?                 
                         YEAH.  

13:02.281 --> 13:04.215
JUST, YOU KNOW,                 
GOING TO THE WRONG PLACES,      

13:04.283 --> 13:05.917
AND THEN IT JUST CAME           
     AND HIT ME.                

13:05.985 --> 13:08.887
         WHEN I WAS 19,         
I ALMOST GOT MY LIFE TAKEN AWAY.

13:08.954 --> 13:12.891
      I WAS SHOT IN THE LEG     
         BY GANGBANGERS,        

13:12.958 --> 13:15.326
BY BEING AT THE WRONG PLACE

WITH A BARRAGE OF PUNCHES.

  <i>BROUGHT TO YOU BY BURGER KING.</i>

33:55.633 --> 33:57.200
                    YEAH!       

33:57.268 --> 34:01.304
 White: THE FIRST ROUND, PSYCHO 
 COMES OUT, GOES FOR A TAKEDOWN.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.007
    SAYERS ACTUALLY LOCKS IN    
    A GUILLOTINE CHOKE          

34:04.075 --> 34:06.576
         AND LOOKS LIKE         
    HE'S GOT IT PRETTY TIGHT,   

34:06.644 --> 34:10.347
  AND I'M SURE KOSCHECK IS OVER 
    THERE [BLEEP] HIS PANTS,    

34:10.415 --> 34:12.649
    THINKING, "OH, NO.          
 THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN."

34:15.386 --> 34:18.321
 Sayers: I WAS ABLE TO SHUT DOWN
         HIS JUDO GAME,         

34:18.389 --> 34:21.690
AND EVEN WHEN HE DID MANAGE     
TO GET ME DOWN, I'D GET BACK UP,

34:21.759 --> 34:25.962
BUT I WAS FOCUSING SO MUCH ON IT
THAT I FORGOT TO DO <i>MY</i> OFFENSE, 

34:26.030 --> 34:27.531
  WHICH IS THROWING THE HANDS.  

34:27.598 --> 34:30.033
Johnson: DANE HAD HIM TAKEN DOWN
    TWICE IN THE FIGHT.         

34:30.101 --> 34:32.436
        SAKO REACHED BACK       
      AND GRABBED THE CAGE.     

34:32.503 --> 34:34.737
        LET GO OF THE FENCE!    
          HAND OUT OF THE FENCE!

34:34.806 --> 34:36.440
          YOU TAKE AWAY         
     HIM GRABBING THE CAGE,     

34:36.507 --> 34:38.442
    THERE WAS TWO TIMES         
WHEN DANE'S TAKING HIM DOWN     

34:38.509 --> 34:39.609
 AND POSSIBLY WINNING THE ROUND.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.713
White: SECOND ROUND, DANE SAYERS
  COMES OUT, LANDS A BIG PUNCH. 

34:43.781 --> 34:45.482
                    HEY!        

34:47.085 --> 34:49.485
  BUT PSYCHO GETS THE TAKEDOWN. 

34:49.554 --> 34:51.621
CONTROLS MOST OF THE ROUND      
     WITH GROUND-AND-POUND.     

34:51.688 --> 34:57.294
SAYERS GETS BACK TO HIS FEET AND
LOOKS VERY GOOD AGAINST A GUY --

34:57.361 --> 34:59.596
A GRAPPLER OF THAT CALIBER.     

34:59.664 --> 35:01.264
    [ AIR HORN BLOWS ]          

35:01.332 --> 35:03.066
          Chivitchian:          
    I STUCK TO MY GAME PLAN,    

35:03.134 --> 35:05.569
      AND THAT WAS TO KEEP      
      THE PRESSURE ON HIM       

35:05.636 --> 35:07.370
        AND OUTSCORE HIM.       

35:07.438 --> 35:10.307
ALL RIGHT, ALL THREE JUDGES     
    SCORED THIS FIGHT 20-18.    

35:10.374 --> 35:12.442
    AND THE WINNER IS PSYCHO.   

35:12.510 --> 35:13.944
              WHOO!             

35:14.011 --> 35:16.413
     WHOEVER'S GONNA FACE ME    
KNOWS THEY'RE GONNA BATTLE      

35:16.481 --> 35:19.483
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO TAKE MY HEAD 
OFF IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME DOWN.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.518
        L.A. ALL THE WAY.       

35:21.586 --> 35:23.987
SO, PSYCHO ENDS UP WINNING      
     BY UNANIMOUS DECISION,     

35:24.055 --> 35:26.957
    BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE         
    ARE IMPRESSED WITH DANE.    

35:27.024 --> 35:30.360
    Koscheck: YOU KNOW,         
WE ALL UNDERESTIMATED DANE      

35:30.428 --> 35:32.963
        'CAUSE WE THOUGHT       
      HE WASN'T VERY GOOD,      

35:33.030 --> 35:34.965
     AND, MAN, HE SHOWED UP,    
AND HE FOUGHT HIS BUTT OFF      

35:35.032 --> 35:36.533
AND TOOK IT TO A DECISION.

35:38.436 --> 35:42.506

 EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE FIGHT. 

35:42.573 --> 35:45.342
         HE PROVED THAT         
HE'S A MUCH BETTER FIGHTER      

35:45.409 --> 35:47.344
  THAN HE WAS AT THE BEGINNING. 

35:47.411 --> 35:50.113
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT     
YOU MIGHT HAVE A PLACE COMING.  

35:50.181 --> 35:51.381
I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR YOU,        

35:51.449 --> 35:53.917

ON THE...IF YOU WANT.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.791
        YEAH!                   

36:01.859 --> 36:03.660
     Koscheck: SAKO'S FIGHT     
    WAS A GOOD FIGHT FOR US,    

36:03.728 --> 36:05.295
    OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE WE WON.   

36:05.363 --> 36:08.765

 THAT ARE OUT OF THE COMPETITION

    TO GET A WILD CARD.         

36:10.801 --> 36:12.536
THAT'S LIKE A SECOND CHANCE     
            AT LIFE.

AND NOW I HAVE TO SIT DOWN      
        WITH THE COACHES,       

36:24.282 --> 36:26.249
 AND WE BASICALLY HAVE TO DECIDE

36:26.317 --> 36:28.752
      WHO WE THINK DESERVES     
     TO GO TO THE WILD CARD.    

36:28.819 --> 36:32.122

     OR A GSP OR A KOSCHECK.    

36:32.190 --> 36:34.191

 DESERVE TO BE ON THE WILD CARD?

          ON THIS LIST,

AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED?     

36:40.765 --> 36:43.466
              I OBVIOUSLY THINK 
            THAT ONE OF THE GUYS

36:43.534 --> 36:46.670
          THAT REALLY STOOD OUT 
    IN MY MIND WAS WILKINSON.   

36:46.737 --> 36:48.271
     I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.     

36:48.339 --> 36:49.372
          HE FOUGHT HIS ASS OFF.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.473
     I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.     

36:50.541 --> 36:52.876
        AND I THINK MARC STEVENS

36:52.944 --> 36:56.446
    DEFINITELY HAS THE POTENTIAL
    TO WIN THIS THING STILL.    

36:56.514 --> 36:58.915
         JUST KIND OF GOT CAUGHT
                IN THE CHOKE.   

36:58.983 --> 37:02.085
    OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?    
        WHO DO YOU LIKE?

SKILL-WISE, THE BEST FIGHTER,   

37:06.157 --> 37:10.060
THAT I BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE     
THERE, IT'S AARON WILKINSON.    

37:10.127 --> 37:12.796

WITH MY HEART,                  

37:12.863 --> 37:15.632
  WITHOUT THINKING              
 ABOUT SKILLS-WISE,             

37:15.700 --> 37:17.400
IT'S DANE, BECAUSE DANE --      

37:17.468 --> 37:20.370
  WHAT YOU SEE NOW,             
    IN ONE WEEK,                

37:20.438 --> 37:22.472
HE'S GONNA BE MUCH BETTER       
THAN WHAT YOU SEE NOW.          

37:22.540 --> 37:24.574
  AND IN TWO WEEKS,             
HE'S GONNA BE EVEN MORE BETTER. 

37:24.642 --> 37:28.078
IN THREE WEEK, YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE CAN SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

37:28.145 --> 37:32.249

            A GOOD WRESTLER     

37:32.316 --> 37:33.783
             IS GONNA BE SAYERS 
                ALL THE TIME    

37:33.851 --> 37:36.553
JUST BECAUSE HE'S GONNA PROBABLY
TAKE THEM DOWN AND BEAT ON THEM.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.255
  I DON'T THINK SO.             

37:38.322 --> 37:40.123

                ON THE FEET,    

37:40.191 --> 37:42.158
        THEN HE'S GONNA HAVE    
         A BETTER CHANCE TO WIN.

ON THE GROUND,                  

37:43.961 --> 37:45.929

ABLE TO POP BACK UP.            

37:45.997 --> 37:47.364
        NO, I TOTALLY --        

37:47.431 --> 37:49.766
  LIKE I SAID, TRY TO TAKE OUT  
      THE WHOLE TEAM THING.     

37:49.834 --> 37:52.002
         AND I'M LOOKING        
     FOR THE TWO BEST GUYS.     

37:52.069 --> 37:54.037
    I NEED THE TWO BEST GUYS.   
    THAT'S WHAT I NEED.

    AND I GOT TOGETHER          

38:04.849 --> 38:06.483
