01:27.493 --> 01:28.762
Hello?

01:45.446 --> 01:46.714
Hello?

01:58.659 --> 02:01.893
Why are you doin' this?
Oh, God!

02:27.020 --> 02:28.819
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

02:28.821 --> 02:30.724
I thought you said you had
your friend's thing tonight.

02:31.825 --> 02:35.560
Oh, I do. And I lost track.

02:35.562 --> 02:36.961
You know, gettin' out
and connecting with other

02:36.963 --> 02:40.031
human beings
is not such a bad thing.

02:40.033 --> 02:41.866
- I've heard that.
- 'Come on.'

02:41.868 --> 02:44.269
I'll give you a ride. What time
are you supposed to be there?

02:44.271 --> 02:46.571
- Twenty minutes ago.
- 'Perfect.'

02:46.573 --> 02:48.773
You're fashionable.

02:48.775 --> 02:50.574
Come on. Let's go.

02:50.576 --> 02:52.612
'Step away from the desk.'

02:57.651 --> 03:01.853
- 'Thank you for the ride.'
- 'Oh, my pleasure.'

03:01.855 --> 03:03.287
- Have fun.
- Okay.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.958
Hope you don't give into
too much trouble.

03:09.862 --> 03:12.964
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:12.966 --> 03:14.698
Sorry I-I'm late.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.867
It's okay.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.270
Come in with me?

03:18.272 --> 03:20.871
Yeah, I kind of realized
I could only fake

03:20.873 --> 03:23.741
my interest in fashion
for so long.

03:23.743 --> 03:25.577
We're in the same boat.

03:25.579 --> 03:27.012
Good.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.990
There she is.

03:38.992 --> 03:42.960
Max! Oh, you made it.
Welcome to Panache.

03:42.962 --> 03:44.996
Hey, um..

03:44.998 --> 03:46.698
Sorry I-I'm dressed
like this.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.865
I came in straight
from work.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.668
Oh, gosh, you look great.

03:49.670 --> 03:52.002
So y-you guys remember Simon?

03:52.004 --> 03:53.305
- 'Yeah.'
- Yeah, he's..

03:53.307 --> 03:55.039
- My um..
- Boyfriend.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.775
You can say it out loud.

03:56.777 --> 03:59.578
Don't feel bad, honey.
She is always been that way.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.779
- Uh, it's been a while, huh?
- Yeah.

04:00.781 --> 04:01.979
High school I think, right?

04:01.981 --> 04:03.315
- 'Yeah.'
- Wow, yeah.

04:03.317 --> 04:05.750
H-how long have you guys
been back in town?

04:05.752 --> 04:08.620
- Uh, a month I guess.
- Oh, wow.

04:08.622 --> 04:10.055
Well, you put this place
together quickly.

04:10.057 --> 04:13.057
Oh, thank you. I had to find
something to fill my days.

04:13.059 --> 04:15.327
Being a captive woman
is glamorous and all

04:15.329 --> 04:16.927
but I was really
quite bored.

04:16.928 --> 04:19.096
Yeah, I don't think
I'd be very good at that either.

04:19.099 --> 04:21.065
Thank God 'cause on my salary
I could keep you

04:21.067 --> 04:22.900
for about two days.

04:22.902 --> 04:24.068
Well, I teach.

04:24.070 --> 04:25.936
- Oh..
- Oh, yeah.

04:25.938 --> 04:27.071
I thought
it was about time I put

04:27.073 --> 04:28.939
my fashion degree
to good use.

04:28.941 --> 04:31.142
Besides we missed Brixton,
didn't we?

04:31.144 --> 04:32.710
Well, one of us did.

04:32.712 --> 04:33.945
You still catchin'
bad guys, Max?

04:33.947 --> 04:35.145
On a good day.

04:35.147 --> 04:37.881
I had no idea
how crazy things were

04:37.883 --> 04:39.818
until I started dating
a detective.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.652
Well, you can't put
a tiger in a cage.

04:41.654 --> 04:43.020
Yeah, she'd just
gnaw her way out.

04:43.022 --> 04:45.390
And it's my job. I come home
every night.

04:45.392 --> 04:46.758
- Don't I?
- Yes, you do.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.792
Speaking of,
I gotta get out of here

04:48.794 --> 04:50.861
- Train's in an hour.
- Goin' somewhere special?

04:50.863 --> 04:52.364
No, just work.

04:52.366 --> 04:55.099
Well, all he does
is work. Work, work, work.

04:55.101 --> 04:57.135
I don't know him, actually.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.104
I gotta go. Bye, hon', goodbye.
I love you.

04:59.106 --> 05:00.405
- Great to see you guys.
- 'Yeah.'

05:00.407 --> 05:03.174
- Have a good night.
- Okay, Bye.

05:03.176 --> 05:04.708
I'm gonna see if that young lady

05:04.710 --> 05:06.176
can help me out
with a new outfit.

05:06.178 --> 05:08.813
I don't know if adjunct to
professor chic is as sexy

05:08.815 --> 05:10.681
as it was in the nineties.

05:10.683 --> 05:11.785
Go get 'em.

05:13.953 --> 05:16.987
- So..
- It's so good to see you.

05:16.989 --> 05:19.390
Yeah, you, too. I glad
that you moved back.

05:19.392 --> 05:21.393
Ah, me, too.

05:21.395 --> 05:23.395
So, he travels a lot?

05:23.397 --> 05:25.929
Ah, define a lot.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.866
- That much, huh?
- Yeah.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.734
Nice job in the ring though.

05:29.736 --> 05:32.871
Yeah, I'm not complaining
about that. He did pretty good.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.742
What about you guys?
Are you guys serious?

05:36.409 --> 05:39.443
We just moved in together.

05:39.445 --> 05:42.681
I'm freaking out, a little bit.

05:42.683 --> 05:46.150
Wow, Simon Jacobson
scored Maxine Payton.

05:46.152 --> 05:50.722
Star lacrosse player with
the weird pizza face chess king.

05:50.724 --> 05:52.222
Hell must be freezing over.

05:52.224 --> 05:54.859
He's nice.

05:54.861 --> 05:57.162
Well, he's blossomed
into a very hot swan.

05:57.164 --> 06:00.231
Very nerdy... hot swan.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.434
He's sweet.

06:02.436 --> 06:04.135
Very different for me.

06:04.137 --> 06:07.005
Yeah, he's much different than
Ryan, which is a good thing.

06:07.007 --> 06:08.773
Right? Is it?

06:08.775 --> 06:11.008
I mean, I don't know.
Are guys talking marriage?

06:11.010 --> 06:14.244
No, the thought of marriage
makes me wanna vomit.

06:14.246 --> 06:16.814
And I'm sure
you've made him aware of that.

06:18.217 --> 06:19.686
Sorry.

06:22.188 --> 06:23.657
'Ring, ring.'

06:24.491 --> 06:27.458
Wake up, Brixton PD.

06:27.460 --> 06:31.261
The deceptive will be
brought into the light.

06:31.263 --> 06:33.231
That's weird. Who is it?

06:33.233 --> 06:34.765
It's from Nick.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.133
'What was that about?'

06:36.135 --> 06:37.671
'Who's Nick?'

06:38.738 --> 06:39.839
My partner.

06:43.075 --> 06:44.775
Lemme guess. Work?

06:44.777 --> 06:47.845
Yeah. Yeah, I, um, Jen,
I am so sorry.

06:47.847 --> 06:49.246
No, it's...

06:49.248 --> 06:51.982
This is am-amazing,
we should just catch up soon.

06:51.984 --> 06:53.251
- Okay?
- Yeah, I'm around.

06:53.253 --> 06:54.818
- Good to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

06:54.820 --> 06:55.955
Okay, see you.

07:13.272 --> 07:15.743
- Miss me?
- No.

07:17.243 --> 07:20.244
I was actually hoping that
you'd have the night off.

07:20.246 --> 07:22.881
Yes, I was with my boyfriend.

07:22.883 --> 07:24.515
Was he upset?

07:24.517 --> 07:26.184
He's understanding
this week.

07:26.186 --> 07:27.818
Okay, honestly

07:27.820 --> 07:29.520
as your work husband,
I would really appreciate

07:29.522 --> 07:31.989
if you would not say nice things
about your weird boyfriend.

07:31.991 --> 07:36.294
Okay? It just makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

07:36.296 --> 07:37.929
Shut up.

07:37.931 --> 07:39.099
And besides, you don't
mean it anyway.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.202
Finished?

07:43.068 --> 07:44.270
Party's inside.

07:51.178 --> 07:52.880
Did you get a weird video
on your phone?

07:54.013 --> 07:55.246
Weird video?

07:55.248 --> 07:57.816
What do you mean,
a weird video?

07:57.818 --> 07:58.885
Never mind.

08:05.058 --> 08:06.224
Who found him?

08:06.226 --> 08:07.762
A couple of teenagers.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.128
Is he reported missing?

08:11.130 --> 08:12.996
Not that I know of.

08:12.998 --> 08:16.034
But, uh, judging by
the expensive watch on his wrist

08:16.036 --> 08:19.270
I think it's safe to say
that uh, he wasn't robbed.

08:19.272 --> 08:21.972
Given an hour,
he would have been.

08:21.974 --> 08:23.607
No one's crossed their fingers
with that..

08:23.609 --> 08:25.243
Oh, bingo.

08:25.245 --> 08:28.282
'We got... Tom Bregson, MD.'

08:32.017 --> 08:33.283
So...

08:33.284 --> 08:34.789
Clothes are off.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.357
Sex thing?

08:39.625 --> 08:42.292
Sex thing gone wrong.

08:42.294 --> 08:44.130
I'll have Mohammed swab
for body fluids.

08:54.341 --> 08:56.342
What do you make of this
heart shaped necklace?

08:58.377 --> 08:59.412
What is it?

09:01.180 --> 09:06.050
I don't know. It's a broken
heart charm, silver.

09:06.052 --> 09:09.089
It probably from his girlfriend,
ex-girlfriend?

09:10.957 --> 09:13.892
Or some whack job
trying to be clever.

09:13.894 --> 09:16.094
Well, everyone's trying to be
the next Hillside Strangler.

09:16.096 --> 09:18.162
So...

09:18.164 --> 09:20.898
Forensics is on their way. I
think they can handle the rest.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.667
Let's go notify
next of kin.

09:22.669 --> 09:24.103
You got it, boss.

09:30.644 --> 09:32.042
'Victim's wife is
Sarah Bregman.'

09:32.044 --> 09:34.244
'No children, no prior arrests.'

09:34.246 --> 09:36.114
They've been married
for 18 years.

09:36.116 --> 09:38.919
Okay? Well, anything unusual?

09:40.086 --> 09:42.052
Nothing out of the ordinary.

09:42.054 --> 09:43.189
At least, not yet.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.426
'Francis, we'll do the wake here
from 3 to 5 on Friday.'

09:48.428 --> 09:50.928
And, oh, call La Petite Chateau

09:50.930 --> 09:52.931
and have them prepare
everything.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.666
French was always
Tom's favorite.

09:54.668 --> 09:56.234
Alright listen,
Mrs. Bregson, I...

09:56.236 --> 09:58.268
Call me Sarah.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.238
Look, we're sorry that we
have to do this right now.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.205
I just can't believe he's dead.

10:02.207 --> 10:04.441
If I don't keep distracting
myself with planning

10:04.443 --> 10:06.945
I'm gonna have
a nervous breakdown.

10:06.947 --> 10:08.916
When was the last time
you saw your husband alive?

10:10.216 --> 10:11.248
Three days ago.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.716
He set off for work

10:12.718 --> 10:14.952
and never came back.

10:14.954 --> 10:17.388
You didn't file a
missing persons report?

10:17.390 --> 10:19.290
No.

10:19.292 --> 10:23.161
I mean, I know that
sounds strange but I didn't.

10:23.163 --> 10:25.229
So you knew where he was?

10:25.231 --> 10:26.431
No, you never knew with Tom.

10:26.433 --> 10:27.998
He would say one thing

10:28.000 --> 10:30.200
and then do another.

10:30.202 --> 10:32.036
Was it unusual
for your husband

10:32.038 --> 10:34.973
to be gone
for long periods of time?

10:34.975 --> 10:37.175
On occasion, like..

10:38.377 --> 10:40.013
There's no reason for secrets.

10:42.182 --> 10:43.484
Tom would go on benders.

10:45.385 --> 10:47.484
Alcohol?

10:47.486 --> 10:50.053
Among other things.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.455
Last fall, he said
he was going to the gym.

10:51.457 --> 10:53.191
He was gone for two weeks.

10:53.193 --> 10:56.259
'Came back smelling like
some alley in Saigon.'

10:56.261 --> 10:58.463
He... we had this huge fight.

10:58.465 --> 11:02.066
He went to rehab
for 30 days.

11:02.068 --> 11:05.103
Couples counselling, the works.

11:05.105 --> 11:07.372
Actually thought
he was getting better lately.

11:07.374 --> 11:09.340
And then he disappears
for three days.

11:09.342 --> 11:10.541
Yeah, but I thought
he would come back

11:10.543 --> 11:12.075
like he always tends to do.

11:12.077 --> 11:14.211
He's a bit of a stray.

11:14.213 --> 11:16.147
And judge me if you'd like

11:16.149 --> 11:18.548
but no matter how much
you love someone

11:18.550 --> 11:20.353
you can't control what they do.

11:23.222 --> 11:25.255
Is there anyone that
wanted your husband dead?

11:25.257 --> 11:27.291
Yeah, does he owe anyone money?

11:27.293 --> 11:30.327
Does he have any
outstanding debts?

11:30.329 --> 11:31.396
Not that I can think of.

11:31.398 --> 11:33.398
Look, if you don't mind

11:33.400 --> 11:35.266
I really need to go lay down.

11:35.268 --> 11:37.104
Francis will show you out.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.404
If you can think
of anything else

11:40.406 --> 11:41.806
no matter how small,
please call me.

11:41.808 --> 11:43.242
'I'll leave my card
with Francis.'

11:52.117 --> 11:54.819
'Was their marriage good,
Sarah and Tom's?'

11:54.821 --> 11:56.454
You know, as good as any.

11:56.456 --> 11:57.991
He step out on her a lot?

12:00.526 --> 12:03.393
When he was younger, he was
much better at hiding it.

12:03.395 --> 12:06.797
Always back by dinner,
never gone overnight.

12:06.799 --> 12:09.267
Until nights became weekends.

12:09.269 --> 12:12.803
And nothing here seemed
to be enough.

12:12.805 --> 12:14.439
I was furious.

12:14.441 --> 12:16.541
But Sarah..

12:16.543 --> 12:19.176
'...never seemed bothered.'

12:19.178 --> 12:21.845
She said that he went to rehab.
What was that for?

12:21.847 --> 12:25.550
Was it for pharmaceuticals,
or cocaine or what?

12:25.552 --> 12:30.220
No, maybe recreational, but
he didn't go to rehab for drugs.

12:30.222 --> 12:32.523
He went for sex addiction.

12:32.525 --> 12:35.261
If she's aware of this,
why did she stay with him?

12:36.629 --> 12:39.464
You saw his photographs
didn't you?

12:39.466 --> 12:42.166
His smile lit up a room.

12:42.168 --> 12:45.369
His charm was enigmatic.

12:45.371 --> 12:49.507
People were just... drawn to him.

12:49.509 --> 12:52.109
Were you one of those people?

12:52.111 --> 12:55.245
What are you insinuating?

12:55.247 --> 12:58.615
Embarrassment in her social
circle would have been lethal.

12:58.617 --> 13:01.219
What was the real reason
she stayed?

13:01.221 --> 13:03.653
Charm only goes so far.

13:03.655 --> 13:06.657
Sarah grew up wealthy.

13:06.659 --> 13:08.593
But her dad had
a gambling problem.

13:08.595 --> 13:10.862
Lost every dime.

13:10.864 --> 13:14.498
Tom was the smartest kid
in his trailer park.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.370
Became a gifted plastic surgeon.

13:18.505 --> 13:19.537
Money.

13:19.539 --> 13:20.872
You know what's worse than

13:20.874 --> 13:22.209
'having a cheating husband?'

13:24.209 --> 13:26.310
Being poor.

13:26.312 --> 13:29.312
'Francis.'

13:29.314 --> 13:33.219
I'm afraid duty calls.
Thank you.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.220
Thank you for your time.

13:36.222 --> 13:37.356
'You know your way out.'

13:43.663 --> 13:46.330
Ms. Bregson wasn't the only one
in love with him.

13:46.332 --> 13:47.898
You think either of them have
the capacity to kill him?

13:47.900 --> 13:50.567
Maybe, I'd kill you
under certain circumstances.

13:50.569 --> 13:52.205
I'll sleep with one eye open.

14:05.351 --> 14:07.218
So you think it's the wife.

14:07.220 --> 14:08.652
Well, Lord knows
she had the motive.

14:08.654 --> 14:11.254
She's broke. She's married
to a rich Lothario.

14:11.256 --> 14:14.224
May be she didn't want to be the
laughing stock of her community.

14:14.226 --> 14:17.295
You know, I caught a domestic
case when I was a beat cop.

14:17.297 --> 14:19.397
Woman stabbed her husband
for putting mayonnaise

14:19.399 --> 14:21.431
on her ham sandwich.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.667
Wouldn't have been easier just
to screw the tennis pro?

14:23.669 --> 14:26.237
Or the golf pro,
the yoga instructor

14:26.239 --> 14:28.239
'you got the pool boy.'

14:28.241 --> 14:29.507
And the heart shaped necklace.

14:29.509 --> 14:32.409
That's a bit kitschy
for lady Bregson.

14:32.411 --> 14:33.412
'Maybe it was the butler.'

14:34.547 --> 14:36.647
He was just as smitten.

14:36.649 --> 14:38.449
You think they were lovers?

14:38.451 --> 14:40.218
Who knows?

14:40.220 --> 14:42.954
His primary issue was having
sex outside the house.

14:42.956 --> 14:45.690
It seems like that was the
only thing he was engaging in.

14:45.692 --> 14:47.691
Whatever you got to do,
just wrap it up.

14:47.693 --> 14:50.761
Get back on the board. We are
short staffed, it's only Monday.

14:50.763 --> 14:52.763
Who knows what fresh hell
is gonna unleash

14:52.765 --> 14:54.431
by the end of the week?

14:54.433 --> 14:55.468
- Do our best, captain.
- Yep.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.592
Uh-oh, what's the matter?

15:22.629 --> 15:23.764
Murder case.

15:26.566 --> 15:28.468
I honestly don't know
how you do it.

15:29.702 --> 15:31.270
Some days, I don't either.

15:32.672 --> 15:34.207
Come here.

15:42.448 --> 15:43.817
How was the rest of your day?

15:44.750 --> 15:46.484
It was fine.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.619
I gave my students a pop quiz.

15:48.621 --> 15:51.257
Do you imagine they were
thrilled about that?

15:53.492 --> 15:55.659
Thank you for making dinner.

15:55.661 --> 15:58.028
You're welcome.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.529
You know, considering
you can barely boil an egg

15:59.531 --> 16:01.731
I feel it's my obligation
to cook for you.

16:01.733 --> 16:05.369
I don't know how
I'd survive without you.

16:05.371 --> 16:07.674
Can you believe we've been
together for two years now?

16:09.409 --> 16:10.777
I think we should
be making that next step.

16:12.611 --> 16:14.247
You wanna get a cat?

16:15.515 --> 16:17.447
No.

16:17.449 --> 16:19.082
A dog.

16:19.084 --> 16:21.821
Max, I'm serious.

16:25.324 --> 16:28.261
Look, I love you, and we're not
getting any younger.

16:30.529 --> 16:32.765
Can we not do this right now?

16:34.833 --> 16:36.669
When would be
a good time for you?

16:38.638 --> 16:41.372
I don't know.

16:41.374 --> 16:42.739
Tomorrow?

16:42.741 --> 16:44.841
Tomorrow.

16:44.843 --> 16:47.677
Tomorrow. Okay.

16:47.679 --> 16:51.418
You know, in your line of work,
tomorrow, we may all be dead.

17:27.553 --> 17:28.621
Hello?

17:30.622 --> 17:31.757
Lola?

18:02.788 --> 18:04.357
Rough night?

18:05.490 --> 18:06.625
The usual.

18:08.928 --> 18:11.531
Is, uh, Simon still trying
to put a ring on it?

18:14.167 --> 18:15.435
Not in the mood.

18:16.502 --> 18:17.701
But he does know
that he's the one

18:17.703 --> 18:19.506
that wears a dress
in that equation, right?

18:20.907 --> 18:22.606
Not listening.

18:22.608 --> 18:24.378
Poor guy, poor guy.

18:25.477 --> 18:26.912
What? No!

18:29.715 --> 18:32.683
- Do you see this?
- Yeah.

18:32.685 --> 18:34.217
Pardon the interruption.

18:34.219 --> 18:38.789
We've got moral corruption
in our own backyard.

18:38.791 --> 18:41.759
Revealing truths
will leave some scarred.

18:41.761 --> 18:44.628
Out, out into the sun.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.664
'Judgment day has begun.'

18:46.666 --> 18:49.733
Those who heavy secrets weigh

18:49.735 --> 18:53.503
the disloyal are soon to pay.

18:53.505 --> 18:55.505
Everybody wears a mask.

18:55.507 --> 18:58.742
But how long will all this last?

18:58.744 --> 19:00.543
Bye for now.

19:00.545 --> 19:01.846
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

19:01.848 --> 19:03.647
Looks like they hacked
into our system

19:03.649 --> 19:05.683
and, and rerouted us
to the paper.

19:05.685 --> 19:07.217
"The cheaters revealed

19:07.219 --> 19:09.755
Adeline Lilly hacker reveals
unfaithful spouses?"

19:10.723 --> 19:12.822
A dating website?

19:12.824 --> 19:14.625
Well, it's not a dating website,
it's a cheating website.

19:14.627 --> 19:16.630
But if you want to call
it that, then you can.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.562
You see any names?

19:19.564 --> 19:23.634
No, it's just user profiles
and pictures. That's it.

19:23.636 --> 19:26.003
Well, there's a lot
of body shots on here. I mean..

19:26.005 --> 19:27.504
'I mean you could
still identify someone'

19:27.506 --> 19:29.840
'if you knew 'em well enough.'

19:29.842 --> 19:32.576
Yeah, well, if there weren't
a hundred pet names and tattoos

19:32.578 --> 19:34.278
those are a dead give away.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.046
Did everybody's screen
get hit with this?

19:37.048 --> 19:39.250
- Yeah.
- What's this about?

19:39.252 --> 19:41.051
- Is this familiar?
- I think it's Incognito.

19:41.053 --> 19:43.853
It's just a small underground
hacker group, hackers.

19:43.855 --> 19:45.255
Incognito? They're hacktivists.

19:45.257 --> 19:47.724
This is puritanical vigilante.

19:47.726 --> 19:49.693
Yeah, or a pissed off
housewife.

19:49.695 --> 19:52.596
'Man, this is a great time
to be a divorce lawyer.'

19:52.598 --> 19:56.934
Yeah, well, if it is Incognito,
they've expanded their message.

19:56.936 --> 19:59.736
'So let's get Cyber
on this right away.'

19:59.738 --> 20:00.937
I don't know how much
good it's gonna do.

20:00.939 --> 20:04.641
This thing's probably
gone viral already.

20:04.643 --> 20:06.609
Alright.

20:06.611 --> 20:07.913
Damn.

20:13.852 --> 20:16.619
- Mrs. Bregson.
- Can we talk?

20:16.621 --> 20:17.957
Somewhere private?

20:21.694 --> 20:23.530
Yeah, absolutely.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.765
I'm here to claim Tom's body

20:28.767 --> 20:31.635
but they won't
release him to me.

20:31.637 --> 20:33.070
The medical examiner
still needs to perform

20:33.072 --> 20:36.040
an autopsy which can take
several days.

20:36.042 --> 20:38.845
And we also need to
eliminate you as a suspect.

20:41.046 --> 20:43.746
You think I killed him?

20:43.748 --> 20:45.916
Your husband was a philanderer.

20:45.918 --> 20:46.984
I've seen a woman scalp a guy

20:46.986 --> 20:50.588
for not turning off
Sports Center.

20:50.590 --> 20:54.692
It was just sex.
He didn't love any of them.

20:54.694 --> 20:58.995
Is that where you
draw the line? Love?

20:58.997 --> 21:00.598
Look, if you want to
know the truth

21:00.600 --> 21:04.901
I-I don't think Tom was even
capable of love..

21:04.903 --> 21:07.737
Unless he was looking
in a mirror.

21:07.739 --> 21:10.075
Have you heard of the website
Adeline Lilly?

21:11.910 --> 21:14.978
Not until this morning. Why?

21:14.980 --> 21:16.847
Ms. Bregson,
what have you been doing

21:16.849 --> 21:19.984
for the last three days?

21:19.986 --> 21:25.388
I've been at home with Francis.
Waiting. Worried.

21:25.390 --> 21:28.157
Yeah, I'm afraid,
that's not a very good alibi.

21:28.159 --> 21:30.697
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to ask you not to leave town.

21:33.099 --> 21:35.135
I assume I can
still leave this room?

21:36.669 --> 21:37.871
You may.

21:45.111 --> 21:46.877
You think?

21:46.879 --> 21:48.582
We need to
talk to captain.

21:50.115 --> 21:53.417
We need to find out
if Tom is an Adeline Lilly user.

21:53.419 --> 21:54.685
What, do you think
that murders and the leak

21:54.687 --> 21:56.119
are somehow connected?

21:56.121 --> 21:58.388
Don't know.
Can't hurt to check.

21:58.390 --> 21:59.857
'Could just be a coincidence.'

21:59.859 --> 22:02.126
The wife's still
suspect number one.

22:02.128 --> 22:04.128
But the marks on the body
indicate a struggle.

22:04.130 --> 22:07.063
She'd have to be really strong
in order to pull that off.

22:07.065 --> 22:08.634
Or have a gun.

22:09.869 --> 22:12.002
And the heart shaped charm.

22:12.004 --> 22:14.138
I don't know, I get
a bad feeling about it.

22:14.140 --> 22:15.406
Like it's a warning.

22:15.408 --> 22:16.909
Of what?

22:18.076 --> 22:19.845
Another body to come.

22:22.747 --> 22:25.182
What did the video say?

22:25.184 --> 22:28.051
"The disloyal are soon to pay."

22:28.053 --> 22:30.890
Pay? Pay how? Will pay
with-with their lives?

22:32.457 --> 22:35.125
Let's not jump to conclusions
on this, alright?

22:35.127 --> 22:36.859
Let me check with Cyber,
see if they've made any

22:36.861 --> 22:40.100
head way on identifying
any local members of Incognito.

22:41.766 --> 22:45.135
And let's hope that
you're wrong, Detective Payton.

22:45.137 --> 22:47.003
You know when someone says
don't jump to conclusions

22:47.005 --> 22:48.438
I feel like the conclusions
they jump to is

22:48.440 --> 22:50.139
the one they're telling us
not to jump to.

22:50.141 --> 22:52.775
Hey, Maxine.

22:52.777 --> 22:54.811
- How's teach?
- Good.

22:54.813 --> 22:57.880
- Yeah? How good?
- None of your business.

22:57.882 --> 22:59.215
Which basically means
he ain't got nothing

22:59.217 --> 23:00.783
on what you and I had.

23:00.785 --> 23:02.218
Yeah, that's about right.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.221
No lying, no cheating,
no crying myself to sleep

23:04.223 --> 23:07.457
at night, so basically
no similarities.

23:07.459 --> 23:09.059
Come on, Maxine.

23:09.061 --> 23:10.230
It wasn't all that bad.

23:11.996 --> 23:15.131
No. No, I think
it was really good for you.

23:15.133 --> 23:17.033
You were having a good ol' time.

23:17.035 --> 23:18.836
In fact, it was kinda like
you weren't in a relationship

23:18.838 --> 23:20.005
at all.

23:21.474 --> 23:23.777
I still got a lot
of love for you, Maxine.

23:25.477 --> 23:28.244
Don't make me shoot you.

23:29.915 --> 23:32.085
- Hey, Curtis!
- 'What's up?'

23:35.086 --> 23:38.155
You know, he's, he's charming.

23:38.157 --> 23:39.756
I'm been having trouble
understanding how it is

23:39.758 --> 23:41.492
you ever let him get away.

23:41.494 --> 23:45.028
'Payton, Curtis,
there's another body on Laurel.'

23:45.030 --> 23:47.764
Oh, please, let it
just be a home invasion.

23:47.766 --> 23:50.135
You know what? I feel we're not
gonna be so lucky.

24:14.927 --> 24:16.827
Modern day flogging.

24:16.829 --> 24:19.096
'The skin is shredded,
blood loss'

24:19.098 --> 24:21.564
'internal organ failure.'

24:21.566 --> 24:24.069
This lash looks like
it lacerated a kidney.

24:26.005 --> 24:27.937
No pants. Sex whip?

24:27.939 --> 24:30.243
Yeah, maybe he was
into light thrashings.

24:31.274 --> 24:33.142
Maybe the Dom didn't
respect his safe word.

24:35.113 --> 24:37.013
Someone came here
looking for murder.

24:37.015 --> 24:40.184
- How long has be been here?
- Less than 24 hours.

24:40.186 --> 24:43.253
'Whoever it is wanted us
to find this body.'

24:43.255 --> 24:44.757
With a charm.

24:48.226 --> 24:50.130
Swirling circles.

24:52.331 --> 24:53.967
What do you think it means?

24:56.235 --> 24:57.771
No idea.

25:01.372 --> 25:04.574
It's Frank McPherson.

25:04.576 --> 25:07.012
The evangelist preacher
from Public Access?

25:08.346 --> 25:10.947
Yep, that's the one.

25:10.949 --> 25:12.582
This guy wants to ban
birth control

25:12.584 --> 25:15.017
and he promotes abstinence,
but half the people

25:15.019 --> 25:18.054
at his church,
their all teen parents.

25:18.056 --> 25:19.857
Think we should check him
against the leak?

25:19.859 --> 25:21.591
I mean, it wouldn't hurt.
He's obviously into

25:21.593 --> 25:24.394
unconventional practices.

25:24.396 --> 25:27.196
You think
there's a connection?

25:27.198 --> 25:28.599
We should check with
Adeline Lilly and see how

25:28.601 --> 25:31.134
they show up
on credit card statements.

25:31.136 --> 25:32.806
You think they have
a pseudonym?

25:34.873 --> 25:37.241
Makes sense. Wouldn't want
the wives to find out.

25:37.243 --> 25:41.911
Oh, by the way, yesterday's DB
was into asphyxiation.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.080
Autoerotic?

25:44.082 --> 25:46.250
Wasn't the first time
he'd been choked.

25:46.252 --> 25:50.186
Had bruising consistent
with habitual strangling.

25:50.188 --> 25:52.825
Someone's using fetishes
to murder people.

25:54.293 --> 25:56.996
I think we might have
a serial killer on our hands.

26:01.233 --> 26:02.398
I just got home.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.966
I went to feed the horses

26:03.968 --> 26:07.236
and I found him like that.

26:07.238 --> 26:10.242
Came home from where,
Mrs. McPherson?

26:11.274 --> 26:13.910
Um, Red Deer Lake.
My mother lives there.

26:13.912 --> 26:16.914
I visit her every weekend.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.314
Were you and your husband
involved in any sort of

26:18.316 --> 26:20.449
unconventional
sexual practices?

26:20.451 --> 26:23.920
Say, BDSM or anything?

26:23.922 --> 26:26.389
Nothing like that. It was..

26:27.692 --> 26:29.328
He was into..

26:31.030 --> 26:32.995
...flagellation.

26:32.997 --> 26:37.167
He said it helped to
keep demons away.

26:37.169 --> 26:42.105
But, at a point, it felt
like his reasons were impure.

26:42.107 --> 26:43.340
Like he was getting
sexual pleasure

26:43.342 --> 26:45.945
as opposed to religious relief?

26:48.213 --> 26:53.419
Afterward, he was
often... aroused.

26:55.153 --> 26:57.020
I didn't want any part of it.

26:57.022 --> 26:59.423
He liked pain and you
weren't hurting him.

26:59.425 --> 27:03.426
- 'Then who was?'
- I don't know.

27:03.428 --> 27:07.263
Was your husband
ever secretive?

27:07.265 --> 27:09.398
Giving you excuses
that didn't make sense?

27:09.400 --> 27:12.301
Long gaps of time
unaccounted for?

27:12.303 --> 27:15.705
Time that could maybe be filled
by, like a mistress?

27:15.707 --> 27:17.176
Or a dominatrix?

27:18.444 --> 27:21.177
You think my husband
was cheating on me?

27:21.179 --> 27:24.380
Violating our vows?

27:24.382 --> 27:26.183
Is that possible?

27:26.185 --> 27:30.153
I can't imagine
that he would do that to me.

27:30.155 --> 27:33.456
'Please, find out
who did this to my husband.'

27:33.458 --> 27:35.460
He didn't deserve
to die like this.

27:52.177 --> 27:54.778
Skipping school, handsome?

27:54.780 --> 27:56.346
Hey, Jen.

27:56.348 --> 28:00.016
Uh, I need to pick out
an "I'm sorry" gift for Max.

28:00.018 --> 28:02.084
Oh, trouble in paradise?

28:02.086 --> 28:03.352
Yeah, something like that.

28:03.354 --> 28:08.157
Don't worry. I will
find you something great.

28:08.159 --> 28:10.226
Yeah, she's just
so busy at work, you know.

28:10.228 --> 28:12.128
Me pestering her about
getting married

28:12.130 --> 28:13.763
probably isn't
the best idea.

28:13.765 --> 28:15.765
Yeah, I had a friend
once who thought

28:15.767 --> 28:17.533
his wife was working too hard.

28:17.535 --> 28:21.170
Turns out she was
diddling her boss.

28:21.172 --> 28:23.075
You trying to
make me paranoid?

28:24.342 --> 28:27.377
What? No.
No. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

28:27.379 --> 28:30.213
Max would never do that.

28:30.215 --> 28:32.518
I'm sure she loves you
to pieces.

28:34.786 --> 28:36.386
What about you and Greg?

28:36.388 --> 28:39.488
Things seemed to have worked out
pretty well for you guys.

28:39.490 --> 28:42.224
It looks that way, huh?

28:42.226 --> 28:45.061
So, quarter back
became a lawyer.

28:45.063 --> 28:46.396
What kind of law
does he practice?

28:46.398 --> 28:49.398
High profile
divorce cases mostly.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.201
Wow.

28:51.203 --> 28:54.370
Yeah, and he seems
to love it.

28:54.372 --> 28:57.242
But you don't
love it so much?

28:58.274 --> 29:00.176
Yeah, even with the large staff,
he works long hours.

29:00.178 --> 29:01.578
I'm sure you know
something about that.

29:01.580 --> 29:03.116
Yeah.

29:04.149 --> 29:06.315
Pretty lonely?

29:06.317 --> 29:10.520
I find other ways
to occupy my time.

29:10.522 --> 29:13.559
I think we found
exactly what you came for.

29:17.329 --> 29:19.065
I better get back.

29:20.298 --> 29:21.564
Yeah, we wouldn't
want you sticking around

29:21.566 --> 29:23.435
and getting in trouble,
right?

29:26.405 --> 29:27.607
Right.

29:29.108 --> 29:31.274
Right.

29:38.249 --> 29:40.649
Older lacerations
beneath the new.

29:40.651 --> 29:42.651
The bruises you see here
are consistent

29:42.653 --> 29:44.154
'with what you're saying
if he's had'

29:44.156 --> 29:46.656
an ongoing BDSM
relationship.

29:46.658 --> 29:48.859
So why would she stay?

29:48.861 --> 29:50.894
BDSM isn't always about sex.

29:50.896 --> 29:53.330
It's about power, submission

29:53.332 --> 29:55.131
giving up control.

29:55.133 --> 29:56.332
He could've been
getting spanked

29:56.334 --> 29:58.667
and still been
faithful to his wife.

29:58.669 --> 30:02.108
- Well, that's impressive.
- Oh, and then there's this.

30:04.142 --> 30:05.675
'Yeah, what do
the circles mean?'

30:05.677 --> 30:08.211
A spiral, one of the
the oldest symbols

30:08.213 --> 30:09.411
used in spiritual practice.

30:09.413 --> 30:12.349
Pre-Celtic, represents
growth and evolution

30:12.351 --> 30:14.885
life force energy
and fertility.

30:14.887 --> 30:16.653
Fertility.

30:16.655 --> 30:20.293
Am I reaching or is that seem
to be the common theme here?

30:48.687 --> 30:50.419
'McPherson's also
been identified'

30:50.421 --> 30:52.289
'as an Adiline Lilly user.'

30:52.291 --> 30:55.292
'Now, you combine the charms
that we found with the bodies'

30:55.294 --> 30:58.294
it's safe to say we have
a serial killer on our hands.

30:58.296 --> 30:59.963
Now, of course,
we can't say that officially

30:59.965 --> 31:01.731
'until we get a third body.'

31:01.733 --> 31:05.569
At which point, as you know,
the FBI will take over.

31:05.571 --> 31:07.637
Detective Payton,
Detective Curtis

31:07.639 --> 31:09.673
are gonna be on their way
over to Adeline Lilly

31:09.675 --> 31:13.310
to get an actual name list of
these users since they could be

31:13.312 --> 31:15.344
targets for this killer.

31:15.346 --> 31:16.980
Payton?

31:16.982 --> 31:19.648
So we've created a profile
based off of the nature

31:19.650 --> 31:21.484
and the brutality
of the murders.

31:21.486 --> 31:25.455
Likely male, late 20s
to mid 40s, athletic.

31:25.457 --> 31:28.724
Athletic? Nick,
could be you, bro.

31:28.726 --> 31:30.459
Ha-ha, you're funny.

31:30.461 --> 31:32.661
It could be
a disgruntled spouse.

31:32.663 --> 31:33.964
Or a jilted lover.

31:33.966 --> 31:35.665
How about
judgmental church lady?

31:35.667 --> 31:38.435
Oh, look at you. You're on a
roll, buddy, aren't you? Yeah.

31:38.437 --> 31:39.502
Alright, enough.

31:39.504 --> 31:41.605
'Enough. Fellas, kill it.'

31:41.607 --> 31:43.639
Incognito's past
motives have been

31:43.641 --> 31:45.708
infamy and public shame,
never murder.

31:45.710 --> 31:47.776
But there's a first time
for everything.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.446
We feel that anybody
who's been on this site

31:49.448 --> 31:51.447
is potentially at risk.

31:51.449 --> 31:53.782
So let's go get this guy before
someone else gets murdered.

31:53.784 --> 31:56.986
Oh, and if any of you guys
are on that site

31:56.988 --> 31:58.988
now's the time
to shut it down.

31:58.990 --> 32:01.291
Nobody on this police force
is on that site anymore.

32:01.293 --> 32:02.524
You got me?

32:02.526 --> 32:04.694
Let's get out there.
Start moving.

32:04.696 --> 32:06.565
- Come on. Pound the pavement.
- Let's do it, man.

32:08.266 --> 32:09.599
Yeah.

32:09.601 --> 32:12.769
You know, you may have to
delete your profile.

32:12.771 --> 32:14.737
- Funny.
- Max!

32:14.739 --> 32:17.439
There is someone from
Adeline Lilly asking for you.

32:17.441 --> 32:19.609
- On the phone?
- Uh, at reception.

32:19.611 --> 32:20.780
Saved us a trip.

32:23.547 --> 32:26.815
Dylan Berkis,
CEO of Adeline Lilly.

32:26.817 --> 32:28.220
You're a woman.

32:30.421 --> 32:32.554
Last time I checked.

32:32.556 --> 32:36.359
Please forgive my colleague.
He was raised by wolves.

32:36.361 --> 32:38.427
Apparently.

32:38.429 --> 32:39.763
How can we help you?

32:39.765 --> 32:42.599
The press is implying that
there's some connection

32:42.601 --> 32:45.568
between the murders
and our users.

32:45.570 --> 32:48.038
Is there relevance to that
or is it just rumor?

32:48.040 --> 32:50.639
That's why we're here
to try to figure out.

32:50.641 --> 32:53.342
We were hoping you could
help us with that.

32:53.344 --> 32:54.677
In what sense?

32:54.679 --> 32:58.080
We need the full names
of everyone exposed in the leak.

32:58.082 --> 33:02.452
That will be a breach
of our users' privacy.

33:02.454 --> 33:04.321
Their privacy is
already been violated.

33:04.323 --> 33:06.488
They've been
publicly exposed.

33:06.490 --> 33:08.524
Their usernames
have been exposed.

33:08.526 --> 33:10.459
Not their full identities.

33:10.461 --> 33:13.429
Releasing that information
would be a breach of trust.

33:13.431 --> 33:16.669
My users expect discretion.

33:18.336 --> 33:19.769
Well, your users
also expect to cheat

33:19.771 --> 33:21.603
and return home
safe and sound.

33:21.605 --> 33:23.740
However, someone
is targeting them

33:23.742 --> 33:25.542
for a dead pool.

33:25.544 --> 33:28.410
You know, I can't give you that
information without a warrant.

33:28.412 --> 33:29.846
I'd get sued.

33:29.848 --> 33:32.081
So you're saying that
you wouldn't be interested

33:32.083 --> 33:33.818
in helping your users.

33:35.786 --> 33:38.554
Feel free to find me when you
have that little piece of paper

33:38.556 --> 33:41.824
signed by a judge
and I'll happily oblige.

33:41.826 --> 33:43.561
Now if you'll excuse me..

33:49.400 --> 33:50.833
But I like her a lot.

33:50.835 --> 33:53.436
She's-she's so helpful.

33:53.438 --> 33:56.438
I need a drink.
Wanna head to Pete's?

33:56.440 --> 33:59.576
Can't. I've a date. But
I can-I can cancel it for you.

33:59.578 --> 34:00.813
Go on your date.

34:14.726 --> 34:19.629
Hey, hey, hey, look who it is.
Teacher-teacher.

34:19.630 --> 34:22.931
Hey, I was wondering if we could
have a little tutoring session.

34:22.934 --> 34:25.734
- You and me.
- Seriously, Ryan?

34:25.735 --> 34:27.735
Oh, yeah, I'm very
serious actually.

34:27.737 --> 34:29.905
You know what? I'm having a
little trouble with your class.

34:29.907 --> 34:31.443
So I figured..

34:32.842 --> 34:35.844
What do you want?

34:35.847 --> 34:37.545
I want my wife back.

34:39.751 --> 34:43.522
Well, I'm pretty sure that
the feeling is not reciprocated.

34:44.889 --> 34:46.688
You don't even know her, bro.

34:46.690 --> 34:48.489
I was with her for 15 years.

34:48.492 --> 34:52.629
People do outgrow each other.
You know that, right?

34:52.630 --> 34:54.797
Yeah, you don't think
she's gonna outgrow you?

34:54.800 --> 34:58.468
Look, let me tell you this,
like, sweet little

34:58.470 --> 35:01.704
personality thing of yours,
it ain't fooling me, man.

35:01.706 --> 35:03.642
You are not as docile
as you seem.

35:05.577 --> 35:08.644
I'm also not hopped up
on energy drinks and steroids

35:08.646 --> 35:10.213
standing here
questioning my manhood.

35:10.215 --> 35:12.615
But, if, if fighting me,
Ryan, makes you feel

35:12.617 --> 35:15.621
somehow more adequate,
I'm happy to oblige.

35:18.590 --> 35:20.459
She doesn't even know it,
does she?

35:21.860 --> 35:23.796
She traded
one predator for another.

35:26.231 --> 35:28.530
What kind of predator are you?

35:28.532 --> 35:29.868
What kind are you looking for?

35:36.575 --> 35:37.777
Whatever.

35:39.910 --> 35:41.811
'It appears that the
Adeline Lilly Leaks'

35:41.813 --> 35:43.579
'and the murders
of two local business men'

35:43.581 --> 35:45.849
including
Evangelist Frank McPherson

35:45.851 --> 35:47.649
may actually be connected.

35:47.651 --> 35:49.651
A new video was
released this morning

35:49.653 --> 35:51.820
from a group of hackers
known in the deep web

35:51.822 --> 35:53.523
as "Incognito."

35:53.525 --> 35:55.691
Viewer discretion is advised.

35:55.693 --> 36:00.597
Two down, scores to go.
Where to next, no one knows.

36:00.599 --> 36:04.600
Come forth.
Catch me if you can.

36:06.604 --> 36:10.006
Hey, can you change this?
Please? Thanks.

36:10.008 --> 36:11.039
Unless, you wanna
keep watchin'...

36:11.041 --> 36:12.709
No

36:12.711 --> 36:13.876
I'm sorry.

36:13.878 --> 36:16.012
It's two murders in two days.

36:16.014 --> 36:17.680
Brixton hasn't seen
this much action

36:17.682 --> 36:20.015
since that rapist in the 90s.

36:20.017 --> 36:21.917
Yeah.

36:21.919 --> 36:23.952
They never caught that guy.

36:23.954 --> 36:26.722
You think it's a guy?
The killer.

36:26.724 --> 36:29.992
Statistically probable.

36:29.994 --> 36:32.528
And last I checked,
men don't like it very much

36:32.530 --> 36:34.796
when other men
have sex with their wives.

36:34.798 --> 36:37.267
These guys were
pretty promiscuous.

36:37.269 --> 36:40.269
Oh, no more than
we were in our day.

36:40.271 --> 36:41.905
Girl, you would have slept
with a vacuum cleaner

36:41.907 --> 36:43.039
if that paid you a compliment.

36:43.041 --> 36:46.008
That is actually..

36:46.010 --> 36:47.609
...very accurate.

36:47.611 --> 36:49.077
Right.

36:49.079 --> 36:51.981
So, tell me.

36:51.983 --> 36:53.816
How's sex with Simon?

36:53.818 --> 36:55.785
I.. It's..

36:55.787 --> 36:57.287
It's, uh, what?

36:57.289 --> 36:58.720
Come on, just speak up.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.023
Just give me
a little bit of detail.

37:00.025 --> 37:01.990
Greg barely lays
a finger on me anymore

37:01.992 --> 37:04.929
so I've to live vicariously
through someone else.

37:05.963 --> 37:09.064
I've been a little stressed out.

37:09.066 --> 37:10.966
- Mm-hmm.
- A little pre-occupied.

37:10.968 --> 37:14.336
But, I mean, it's... good.

37:14.338 --> 37:16.738
I think.

37:16.740 --> 37:20.577
Well, I'm sure I don't have to
say this to you, obviously.

37:20.579 --> 37:24.113
But, you know I'd stay away
from the whole marriage thing.

37:24.115 --> 37:26.682
Needless to say,
I'm a little gun shy on that.

37:26.684 --> 37:29.117
And Simon's as safe
as a house cat.

37:29.119 --> 37:30.522
And I really do love him.

37:31.622 --> 37:33.055
He is sweet.

37:33.057 --> 37:34.756
Yeah, I get that.

37:34.758 --> 37:37.760
Ryan couldn't keep his pants on.

37:37.762 --> 37:39.928
And yet, he worshipped
the ground that you walked on.

37:39.930 --> 37:43.800
I mean... trips, dates, roses.

37:43.802 --> 37:46.102
Romantic murders, stake outs.

37:46.104 --> 37:49.037
He was always there. Always.

37:49.039 --> 37:51.740
So was the betrayal
and the heartache.

37:51.742 --> 37:53.077
Oh, it's a small price to pay.

37:54.613 --> 37:56.613
What's going on with you?

37:56.615 --> 37:58.914
Nothing. I mean, everything..

37:58.916 --> 38:03.119
Do you ever just feel like
your life chose you?

38:03.121 --> 38:06.356
That if you could choose
differently or if you knew

38:06.358 --> 38:08.358
where the life
would lead you, that maybe

38:08.360 --> 38:10.693
you would just do..

38:10.695 --> 38:13.829
...anything
a little differently?

38:13.831 --> 38:15.731
Greg loves you.

38:15.733 --> 38:18.700
Greg loves me?

38:18.702 --> 38:22.838
Really? And wha-what would
you know about that? Huh, Max?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.740
I mean, really.

38:24.742 --> 38:27.109
You and Ryan were like
lusty young lovers

38:27.111 --> 38:29.044
and had no clue about
what love is.

38:29.046 --> 38:34.716
I mean, aside from Ryan,
loving Ryan, and Simon.

38:34.718 --> 38:36.885
I'm not quite sure what that is.

38:36.887 --> 38:40.023
You're shacking up
with your rebound guy.

38:40.025 --> 38:42.124
You're boring, bland..

38:42.126 --> 38:45.128
Uh! Safe rebound.

38:45.130 --> 38:46.995
You put in 20 years
and then come back and tell me

38:46.997 --> 38:49.865
what you know
love is all about.

38:49.867 --> 38:53.169
Wow! Tell me
how you really feel.

38:53.171 --> 38:56.008
I'm just saying that the..

38:58.410 --> 38:59.712
We're done here.

39:00.678 --> 39:01.814
Good talk.

39:02.747 --> 39:04.146
Max, I was just..

40:52.256 --> 40:54.289
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:54.291 --> 40:57.260
- Where have you been?
- At the gym.

40:57.262 --> 40:58.961
What's all this?

40:58.963 --> 41:00.296
Just working the case.

41:00.298 --> 41:02.198
Any progress?

41:02.200 --> 41:03.936
Oh, it's just too early to know.

41:06.070 --> 41:10.173
Well, I may have
stumbled on to

41:10.175 --> 41:12.307
this little number.

41:12.309 --> 41:14.145
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

41:18.249 --> 41:19.885
Thank you.

41:22.553 --> 41:24.021
You're welcome.

41:25.322 --> 41:27.325
I'm sorry
about the other night.

41:30.294 --> 41:32.063
No, I'm sorry. I..

41:33.564 --> 41:35.097
I've been awful.

41:35.099 --> 41:36.367
No, I shouldn't have pushed you.

41:41.104 --> 41:43.104
You know that
I love you, right?

41:43.106 --> 41:45.177
Yes. Of course, I do.

41:47.177 --> 41:48.846
I mean, I think you do.

41:51.182 --> 41:54.249
It's just, it's the timing.

41:54.251 --> 41:55.885
But that's the thing, babe.

41:55.887 --> 41:58.187
There's never gonna be
a right time.

41:58.189 --> 42:00.122
And I feel like if I don't
push you a little bit

42:00.124 --> 42:01.624
you're just gonna be
content to keep things

42:01.626 --> 42:03.061
the way that they are.

42:05.063 --> 42:06.595
What happened to your head?

42:06.597 --> 42:08.164
Oh, I got hit in the head
with a racquetball

42:08.166 --> 42:10.032
by an angry history professor.

42:10.034 --> 42:11.901
Hmm. Are you okay?

42:11.903 --> 42:14.169
Yeah, I'm fine. He just gets
a little intense, that's all.

42:17.275 --> 42:20.343
So this is from Jen's.

42:20.345 --> 42:23.215
Yeah, I stopped over there
yesterday.

42:25.617 --> 42:28.283
I saw her today.

42:28.285 --> 42:31.220
She was strange,
kind of aggressive with me.

42:31.222 --> 42:33.356
Honestly, babe,
it makes no sense to me

42:33.358 --> 42:35.093
that you're friends with her.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.227
Why would you say that?

42:39.229 --> 42:41.967
I just don't think that she's
as trustworthy as she seems.

42:47.104 --> 42:49.405
Anyway, I'm gonna go to bed.

42:49.407 --> 42:51.173
I'm tired.

42:51.175 --> 42:53.108
Oh, wait, you didn't finish
what you were saying.

42:53.110 --> 42:55.278
No, I.. It's..
I'm sorry.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.013
I, I don't want to be negative.

42:58.015 --> 42:59.282
I'm just really tired.

43:02.452 --> 43:03.988
Okay.

43:04.923 --> 43:06.254
Don't stay up all night.

43:06.256 --> 43:07.459
Get some sleep.

43:37.121 --> 43:38.423
There she is.

43:39.990 --> 43:41.025
'Had a big night?'

43:41.992 --> 43:43.693
I was attacked.

43:43.695 --> 43:45.264
What do you mean
you were attacked? By who?

43:46.697 --> 43:48.296
Guy was waiting in my car.

43:48.298 --> 43:50.365
Alright, first of all,
are you okay?

43:50.367 --> 43:52.169
Yeah, no,
I'm-I'm fine.

43:53.704 --> 43:55.137
What do you think,
that maybe it has something

43:55.139 --> 43:56.738
to do with the case?

43:56.740 --> 43:58.140
Maybe.

43:58.142 --> 43:59.977
I haven't pissed
anybody else off lately.

44:01.178 --> 44:02.213
Was Simon with you?

44:03.715 --> 44:05.050
No.

44:06.017 --> 44:07.252
Does he know?

44:08.318 --> 44:10.452
- Not a chance.
- Look, why?

44:10.454 --> 44:12.021
What are you afraid you're gonna
have to have that

44:12.023 --> 44:13.155
"Quit the force
and have my babies"

44:13.157 --> 44:15.490
conversation or something?

44:15.492 --> 44:17.094
What is this?

44:20.398 --> 44:23.064
'"Murder victims
connected to leak."'

44:23.066 --> 44:24.399
Does captain know about it?

44:24.401 --> 44:26.271
'Detective Payton!'

44:27.405 --> 44:31.075
- Yup.
- 'My office, now.'

44:35.747 --> 44:38.414
'Well, thanks to our lovable,
local journalist friends'

44:38.416 --> 44:39.749
'the feds are steppin' in.'

44:39.751 --> 44:41.082
'I'm gonna assign you and Nick'

44:41.084 --> 44:42.484
'to the Task Force.'

44:42.486 --> 44:45.553
And as you know, no matter
how we may feel about it

44:45.555 --> 44:48.226
they have the lead from here,
you got that?

44:50.394 --> 44:51.996
Yes, sir.

44:53.430 --> 44:57.432
Oh, and, Max, I'm only gonna
say this one time.

44:57.434 --> 44:59.535
Do not go rogue on this.

44:59.537 --> 45:03.138
You get something, you turn
it over to the Task Force, okay?

45:03.140 --> 45:05.508
They have the lead
from here.

45:05.510 --> 45:07.044
Got it?

45:08.146 --> 45:10.211
Understood.

45:10.213 --> 45:13.249
Just focus on the board,
we're still short-handed.

45:13.251 --> 45:14.386
Yes, sir.

45:16.521 --> 45:20.025
So I will rest assure that we
are all on the same page.

45:22.059 --> 45:23.358
Why do I get the feeling
that you and I are headed

45:23.360 --> 45:25.394
'to the board to get
another assignment?'

45:25.396 --> 45:28.229
He's a user or at least
posing as one.

45:28.231 --> 45:29.798
- Who? What do you mean?
- The killer.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.466
He's using the website
to find his victims.

45:31.468 --> 45:32.537
We need his user ID.

45:37.541 --> 45:41.109
Seriously, this is it?
Where'd everybody go?

45:41.111 --> 45:42.410
You're looking at it.

45:42.412 --> 45:45.548
What Brixton's entire cyber
department is you now?

45:45.550 --> 45:48.517
You could thank our mayor
for his dutiful budget cuts.

45:48.519 --> 45:50.419
We need to pull the profiles
of the victims.

45:50.421 --> 45:51.820
We think that
the killer's posing

45:51.822 --> 45:53.421
as a user
on Adeline Lilly.

45:53.423 --> 45:56.225
Yup.
Lola 95.

45:56.227 --> 45:58.227
Only match they have
in common.

45:58.229 --> 46:00.495
'New user,
probably a dummy account.'

46:00.497 --> 46:02.832
It's safe to say
that Lola's a dude.

46:02.834 --> 46:04.834
And why do you think that?

46:04.836 --> 46:06.401
When girls look like that,
they tend to have

46:06.403 --> 46:09.305
ten or twelve pictures
of themselves as opposed to one.

46:09.307 --> 46:12.173
Google images has Lola
linked to a Stacey Penski

46:12.175 --> 46:13.441
from Trenton,
New Jersey.

46:13.443 --> 46:15.179
Probably never been
to California.

46:16.581 --> 46:18.347
- Anything else?
- Inconclusive..

46:18.349 --> 46:20.582
We have a few leads
but nothing confirmed.

46:20.584 --> 46:22.617
Can you get me a name?

46:24.622 --> 46:27.222
Once I know who it is,
you'll know.

46:27.224 --> 46:30.158
Not you though.
You I don't like.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.160
What, you hit on a guy's
girlfriend at a Christmas party

46:32.162 --> 46:33.329
and what,
we can't be friends anymore?

46:33.331 --> 46:36.334
- We gotta go.
- Uh-huh! Fuck!

46:37.334 --> 46:39.468
Bam!

46:39.470 --> 46:41.570
'So, if Sanchez is right about
our perp posing as a female.'

46:41.572 --> 46:43.138
'Does he already know
the victims'

46:43.140 --> 46:44.874
'or did he come
upon them randomly?'

46:44.876 --> 46:46.541
'Well, both victims arrived
on their own accord.'

46:46.543 --> 46:49.144
'I mean, they weren't forced.'

46:49.146 --> 46:52.180
Yup, both were married.
Both were successful.

46:52.182 --> 46:54.316
Both had an atypical
sexual fascination.

46:54.318 --> 46:56.885
Choking and flagellation,
is that normal?

46:56.887 --> 46:58.419
And what about the charms?

46:58.421 --> 47:00.256
You know, dude, were they
specific for the victims

47:00.258 --> 47:03.128
or are they
some sort of overall message?

47:04.361 --> 47:05.394
Hey, how's it lookin'?

47:05.396 --> 47:06.595
You don't want to go
over there.

47:06.597 --> 47:08.564
I think it's best
that we stay right here.

47:08.566 --> 47:12.501
- Why? What's goin' on?
- It's, uh, it's Ryan.

47:12.503 --> 47:14.206
- Ryan who?
- Your ex.

47:16.273 --> 47:17.640
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

47:17.642 --> 47:20.508
The victim.
The body on the beach.

47:20.510 --> 47:22.544
It's Ryan.

47:22.546 --> 47:24.180
He was murdered.

47:30.421 --> 47:32.421
This is not the work
of a shark.

47:32.423 --> 47:35.390
His Achilles were sliced.
They were clean cut.

47:35.392 --> 47:38.294
Definitely not
your typical surfing accident.

47:38.296 --> 47:41.530
No.
This was intentional.

47:41.532 --> 47:44.466
- 'Any witnesses? '
- 'Nothing useful.'

47:44.468 --> 47:45.934
Or you got to be
pretty determined

47:45.936 --> 47:47.403
if your gonna follow
someone out on the surf

47:47.405 --> 47:48.673
with an X-acto blade.

47:50.941 --> 47:52.276
Is there a charm?

47:53.977 --> 47:55.744
An om.

47:55.746 --> 47:57.345
A what?

47:57.347 --> 47:58.747
An om.

47:58.749 --> 48:01.283
Sacred spiritual
icon representing

48:01.285 --> 48:03.385
what Indian mystic cultures
believe was the connection

48:03.387 --> 48:05.454
'between the universe
and the ego.'

48:05.456 --> 48:07.159
It states that the three..

48:31.581 --> 48:32.717
You okay?

48:37.387 --> 48:40.756
You know how badly I wanted to
get out of that marriage.

48:40.758 --> 48:42.624
'We were just
so young when we met.'

48:42.626 --> 48:44.994
'I didn't know anything else.'

48:44.996 --> 48:47.631
I know. I know.

48:49.300 --> 48:51.367
Well, it's not that I..

48:51.369 --> 48:53.371
I didn't want to.
It's just..

48:55.305 --> 48:56.740
He was on Adeline Lilly,
wasn't he?

48:58.608 --> 49:00.377
The app was on his phone.

49:01.479 --> 49:03.579
You mean, before you broke up?

49:03.581 --> 49:06.414
It had been going on for years.

49:06.416 --> 49:08.450
Cops.

49:08.452 --> 49:11.519
Secretaries,
prostitutes.

49:11.521 --> 49:14.023
'I finally had enough.'

49:14.025 --> 49:16.494
- 'So I filed for divorce.'
- Ahem.

49:18.361 --> 49:19.831
Look, I'm sorry, Max.

49:31.374 --> 49:32.841
Dearly beloved

49:32.843 --> 49:36.812
we are gathered here today
to serve justice.

49:36.814 --> 49:39.451
Isn't that right,
Detective Payton?

49:40.584 --> 49:42.684
Wait, did he just say your name?

49:42.686 --> 49:46.789
This one a little too close
to home? My bad.

49:46.791 --> 49:49.624
Until next time.

49:49.626 --> 49:51.262
Is he communicating with you?

49:52.396 --> 49:54.629
He wants me to find him.

49:54.631 --> 49:56.664
And when I do,
I'm gonna kill him.

50:01.539 --> 50:03.805
The Charm Killer,
as we're calling him

50:03.807 --> 50:06.408
assuming it's a he,
has been consistent enough

50:06.410 --> 50:08.343
to warrant our presence.

50:08.345 --> 50:11.548
First and foremost, I'd like
to urge you to move cautiously.

50:12.615 --> 50:13.881
Killing one of your own.

50:13.883 --> 50:16.352
Uh, he's getting more bold

50:16.354 --> 50:18.120
'and though he's not breaking
from the pattern'

50:18.122 --> 50:19.887
'this one seems personal.'

50:19.889 --> 50:22.124
'Now, chances are
he and Detective Curio'

50:22.126 --> 50:24.626
'knew one another
on some level.'

50:24.628 --> 50:28.600
Which means, it's very likely
he may know some of you as well.

50:29.666 --> 50:31.566
Keep your wits about you.

50:31.568 --> 50:33.736
The reality is,
things are gonna get worse

50:33.738 --> 50:34.903
before they get better.

50:34.905 --> 50:36.441
Go home.

50:37.640 --> 50:39.140
I'm on the Task Force.

50:39.142 --> 50:41.876
- Not tonight you're not.
- But..

50:41.878 --> 50:44.379
You're not working tonight.

50:44.381 --> 50:45.517
Go home.

50:48.718 --> 50:51.153
Despite what law enforcement
and the media

50:51.155 --> 50:54.789
would have you believe, there's
no direct connection between

50:54.791 --> 50:57.825
the Charm Killer
and the Adeline Lilly leak.

50:57.827 --> 51:01.465
Our users are not targets
of this depraved mad man.

51:02.867 --> 51:05.934
'We are doing the utmost to
regain the trust and anonymity'

51:05.936 --> 51:09.872
and security of out valued users
and will continue to provide

51:09.874 --> 51:13.709
a much needed service
for our community. Thank you.

51:13.711 --> 51:15.676
Is she completely insane?

51:15.678 --> 51:16.945
She's just trying
to save her company.

51:16.947 --> 51:18.814
She's taunting the killer!

51:18.816 --> 51:21.617
Well, she has to say something.

51:21.619 --> 51:23.452
'I actually feel
sympathy for Ryan.'

51:23.454 --> 51:25.622
I, I think I'm in shock.

51:27.525 --> 51:29.490
I don't want you
on this case.

51:29.492 --> 51:32.660
I can't believe
he's actually dead.

51:32.662 --> 51:35.566
What actually happened?
I mean, can you talk about it?

51:36.633 --> 51:37.865
He was surfing...

51:37.867 --> 51:39.600
You don't have
to talk about this.

51:39.602 --> 51:41.169
Why not?
Everyone's talking about it.

51:41.171 --> 51:42.639
It's all over the news.

51:43.773 --> 51:46.207
Do you think he knew
the killer?

51:46.209 --> 51:47.709
It's probable.

51:47.711 --> 51:50.646
Which means
that he probably knows you too.

51:50.648 --> 51:52.648
I think Simon's right, Max.

51:52.650 --> 51:54.550
I think you
need to recuse yourself.

51:54.552 --> 51:55.954
And that's the thing, right?

51:58.222 --> 51:59.557
I'm not doing that.

52:00.657 --> 52:01.856
Well, if the killer knows you

52:01.858 --> 52:03.858
doesn't make
any difference anyway, right?

52:03.860 --> 52:05.461
That's helpful. Thanks.

52:05.463 --> 52:06.762
Well, I'm just saying

52:06.764 --> 52:08.463
what if she's the only one
that can catch this guy?

52:08.465 --> 52:11.869
- Really, Greg?
- Can we not do this, please?

52:23.914 --> 52:26.481
Hey, are you okay?

52:26.483 --> 52:29.684
Max must be a mess.

52:29.686 --> 52:31.820
Yeah, it's frustrating.

52:31.822 --> 52:35.923
You know, she just
has this wall up and..

52:35.925 --> 52:38.559
I don't know.

52:38.561 --> 52:40.697
So do you think you're getting
close to catching this guy?

52:42.700 --> 52:45.233
I have no idea.
I mean, he's smart.

52:45.235 --> 52:47.838
Probably has a successful job.

52:48.939 --> 52:51.707
Why do you think he's smart?

52:51.709 --> 52:55.010
Because... these are not
thoughtless actions.

52:55.012 --> 52:56.544
It's calculated.

52:56.546 --> 52:58.579
How? What do you mean?

52:58.581 --> 53:00.749
These murders..

53:00.751 --> 53:02.885
...they're-they're not
just judgments

53:02.887 --> 53:04.253
on the people he's condemning

53:04.255 --> 53:06.722
they're-they're statements.

53:06.724 --> 53:09.057
It's-it's a conversation.

53:09.059 --> 53:12.059
How are you holding up?

53:12.061 --> 53:13.961
I'm worried.

53:13.963 --> 53:16.631
You know, I don't..

53:16.633 --> 53:18.834
I-I-I don't know what to do.

53:18.836 --> 53:21.537
Oh..

53:21.539 --> 53:24.006
She's so lucky to have you.

53:24.008 --> 53:27.608
'So, what will you do?'

53:27.610 --> 53:30.278
I don't know.

53:30.280 --> 53:34.485
It sounds strange, but
it's like he's talking to me.

53:38.021 --> 53:40.622
Jen, what're you doing?

53:40.624 --> 53:41.892
Nothing.

53:43.727 --> 53:45.561
Okay.

53:45.563 --> 53:47.932
But whatever this nothing is,
please don't do it.

54:00.644 --> 54:03.579
Sorry, guys, I think it's time
that we call it a night.

54:03.581 --> 54:06.881
Yeah, we should
probably get going, hon.

54:06.883 --> 54:08.749
Yeah.

54:08.751 --> 54:10.651
Night, Max.

54:10.653 --> 54:11.986
Get some sleep.

54:11.988 --> 54:13.791
'I'll walk you guys out.'

55:14.017 --> 55:16.385
'The third in a string
of murders came yesterday'

55:16.387 --> 55:18.820
'to a local
off duty detective.'

55:18.822 --> 55:22.124
'The victim, Ryan Curio, was
brutally attacked and killed'

55:22.126 --> 55:24.126
'while surfing,
and not by a shark'

55:24.128 --> 55:25.926
'but by what sources
are describing'

55:25.928 --> 55:27.995
'as a Charm Killer.'

55:27.997 --> 55:30.168
- 'In sports, the national...'
- Morning.

55:31.769 --> 55:32.937
You sleep okay?

55:34.137 --> 55:36.905
I had a bad dream.

55:36.907 --> 55:38.709
'Stay home today, babe.'

55:40.110 --> 55:43.881
Rest, grieve.
Let Nick catch the bad guys.

55:45.883 --> 55:47.752
Can you stay with me?

55:48.952 --> 55:51.419
I would, but I got
mid-terms today.

55:51.421 --> 55:54.025
I don't have to go all day,
but I, I do have to go.

55:55.858 --> 55:57.761
It's okay.
I'm fine.

56:00.731 --> 56:02.997
- Max, I...
- Thank you for doing this.

56:02.999 --> 56:05.166
It looks so good.

56:07.738 --> 56:10.238
Max, I need to talk to you
about somethin'.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.744
It's been buggin' me
and I-I can't..

56:14.912 --> 56:16.848
Did you and Jen
make up?

56:19.082 --> 56:20.718
Make up?

56:22.052 --> 56:24.952
Yeah, from the other night.

56:24.954 --> 56:26.053
I mean, we don't really
need to make up.

56:26.055 --> 56:27.823
We've been friends forever.

56:27.825 --> 56:29.925
That's funny
because the way that I see it

56:29.927 --> 56:31.195
she's not your friend.

56:33.097 --> 56:35.229
Why would you say that?

56:35.231 --> 56:37.966
She makes me uncomfortable.

56:37.968 --> 56:39.834
Okay? The last times
that I've seen her

56:39.836 --> 56:43.137
she's cornered me,
and she's made it very apparent

56:43.139 --> 56:44.775
that she wants to..

56:46.242 --> 56:48.943
She wants to what?
Steal you away from me?

56:48.945 --> 56:50.745
- Kinda.
- Huh..

56:50.747 --> 56:52.215
I'm serious, Max.

56:53.950 --> 56:57.051
That's just Jen.
She needs to feel wanted.

56:57.053 --> 56:58.787
Well, she's not wanted.

56:58.789 --> 57:00.825
And from this point,
she's no longer welcome.

57:02.992 --> 57:05.059
Excuse me?

57:05.061 --> 57:07.864
She's trying
to get between us, Max.

57:09.867 --> 57:12.968
So you're telling me who I can
and cannot be friends with?

57:12.970 --> 57:14.836
No, I'm not saying that.

57:14.838 --> 57:16.207
Then what are you saying?

57:20.276 --> 57:23.979
Look, just stay home.

57:23.981 --> 57:25.847
Please.

57:25.849 --> 57:27.251
We can talk about it
when I get back.

57:51.974 --> 57:55.075
Max. There's a good morning
surprise. How are you, babe?

57:55.077 --> 57:56.213
Need to talk to you.

57:57.180 --> 57:58.979
Oh, is everything okay?

57:58.981 --> 58:00.548
Did you..

58:00.550 --> 58:02.319
Is something weird going on
between you and Simon?

58:03.352 --> 58:05.553
No.
Why, did he say something?

58:05.555 --> 58:07.222
Yeah.
He said something.

58:07.224 --> 58:09.890
Okay, well, he probably
misread something.

58:09.892 --> 58:11.258
You know I'm friendly
and I just wanted to

58:11.260 --> 58:12.896
make him feel comfortable.

58:13.896 --> 58:16.097
Really?
Nothing beyond that?

58:16.099 --> 58:18.899
Yeah.
I sexually assaulted Simon.

58:18.901 --> 58:20.568
Because of all
the guys in the world

58:20.570 --> 58:22.239
I want your boyfriend.

58:23.907 --> 58:25.907
Don't lie to me.

58:25.909 --> 58:28.780
Uh, no. I'm not.

58:30.314 --> 58:31.816
I'm serious.

58:32.582 --> 58:34.582
It's great to see you, Max.

58:34.584 --> 58:36.387
Thanks for stopping by.

58:39.322 --> 58:40.791
Good talk.

58:51.068 --> 58:54.903
- Catch!
- Fruity charms?

58:54.905 --> 58:57.140
I figured you needed
a little inspiration.

58:58.374 --> 58:59.975
How're you holdin' up?

58:59.977 --> 59:02.611
- By a thread.
- And Simon?

59:02.613 --> 59:06.080
Come on, it can't be easy to see
your girl crying over her ex.

59:06.082 --> 59:07.983
He doesn't have anything
to be jealous of.

59:07.985 --> 59:10.417
Like he's the one man who
somehow got you to marry him.

59:10.419 --> 59:12.053
He turned out to be
a total douche.

59:12.055 --> 59:14.021
I know he's dead but still,
it doesn't..

59:14.023 --> 59:16.426
'Are you guys seein' this?
It's happening again.'

59:18.028 --> 59:20.832
'There aren't usernames.
These are real names.'

59:27.938 --> 59:31.209
'Oh, wow!
Well, so much for discretion.'

59:32.642 --> 59:34.911
- Isn't that your friend?
- Yes.

59:36.213 --> 59:38.213
'This is not good.'

59:38.215 --> 59:39.314
'I knew this was gonna happen.'

59:39.316 --> 59:40.314
Dad even told me it would.

59:40.316 --> 59:41.316
And I didn't listen to him.

59:41.318 --> 59:42.450
I ice it up for you.

59:42.452 --> 59:43.984
This is what happens.

59:49.226 --> 59:51.392
You are insane.

59:51.394 --> 59:54.062
I'm insane? You'd made me
think that I was crazy

59:54.064 --> 59:55.997
while I was paying for you
to sleep with every pool boy

59:55.999 --> 59:57.399
from here to San Jose.

59:57.401 --> 59:59.968
You are crazy.

59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.436
I'm done.
We're done.

01:00:01.438 --> 01:00:02.970
I'm leaving.

01:00:02.972 --> 01:00:05.442
Just.. Please,
I love you, Greg.

01:00:08.278 --> 01:00:10.678
I'm sorry.
I just..

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.046
You were always gone.

01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:13.314
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:13.316 --> 01:00:15.182
You cannot blame
your cheating on me.

01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:17.087
What was I supposed to do?

01:00:18.354 --> 01:00:20.254
You're supposed to be
a faithful wife.

01:00:20.256 --> 01:00:21.990
You're supposed to be
a decent human being.

01:00:21.992 --> 01:00:23.358
- I am. I am.
- 'Are you?'

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.426
You know what you are?
You're dead to me.

01:00:25.428 --> 01:00:26.997
That's what you are.

01:00:32.068 --> 01:00:33.336
I hate you!

01:00:36.305 --> 01:00:37.305
Don't know..

01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:42.176
Jen! Stop. Stop.

01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:44.512
- Oh, get off me. Get off of me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:00:44.514 --> 01:00:46.280
- Come here.
- Get him out of here please.

01:00:46.282 --> 01:00:48.048
Alright, listen, you should
sleep some place else tonight

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.450
I'm gonna take him,
go pack her bag.

01:00:49.452 --> 01:00:51.218
You can take the car, by the way
and get out. And get out.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.090
- Don't, he's crazy!
- Get out.

01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:13.742
What were you thinking?

01:01:13.744 --> 01:01:16.176
I don't know.

01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:17.412
I thought we would
go to counseling

01:01:17.414 --> 01:01:20.383
that we would just,
figure it out somehow.

01:01:21.485 --> 01:01:23.553
Really?
That was your plan?

01:01:25.454 --> 01:01:27.958
I never should've
married him.

01:01:28.758 --> 01:01:30.492
And why would you say that?

01:01:30.494 --> 01:01:32.494
Because he's always
been distant.

01:01:32.496 --> 01:01:36.267
And I was just,
I was too young to even notice.

01:01:38.334 --> 01:01:40.334
You never made him
seem bad.

01:01:40.336 --> 01:01:43.370
'Cause I always thought
it was changing.

01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:46.376
And then, all of a sudden,
I was old.

01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:49.811
Yeah, you're crazy.

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.385
Yeah, a little.

01:01:56.452 --> 01:01:59.189
Simon was telling the truth.
You were hitting on him.

01:02:02.526 --> 01:02:03.995
Why?

01:02:04.561 --> 01:02:06.260
Why would you do that?

01:02:06.262 --> 01:02:09.467
I don't know. I don't know.
It just happens. And..

01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:12.600
What, you can't
control yourself?

01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:15.437
No. I mean, yes.
Yes, I can.

01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:18.807
I just,
I just want something more.

01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:21.075
Like, I want to be wanted.

01:02:21.077 --> 01:02:24.445
And he was... sweet.

01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:27.282
And alone, like me.

01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:29.350
What do you mean like you?

01:02:29.352 --> 01:02:32.419
Like me,
like a little kid just..

01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:35.622
Just waiting
to be noticed.

01:02:35.624 --> 01:02:37.291
Jen you're talking about me.

01:02:37.293 --> 01:02:39.362
So what is it
that you're trying to say?

01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:44.535
You're not there, Max.

01:02:45.836 --> 01:02:48.303
You're the first
to admit it.

01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:51.506
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't happy?

01:02:51.508 --> 01:02:53.644
I guess it's just
easier to pretend.

01:02:58.881 --> 01:03:00.481
So that's okay just to
ruin a relationship.

01:03:00.483 --> 01:03:03.852
No, no. It doesn't make it okay.
I didn't say it was okay.

01:03:03.854 --> 01:03:07.291
It's just, it's familiar.
I..

01:03:19.401 --> 01:03:20.602
What is it?

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:23.207
Oh, yeah, I got to go.

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:28.876
Go pack a bag
and get to my house.

01:03:28.878 --> 01:03:31.345
I'll swing by later
and take you to the hotel.

01:03:31.347 --> 01:03:32.550
Sure.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:28.535
Sanchez, what are you
doing here?

01:04:28.537 --> 01:04:30.537
I can't have this conversation
with anybody else.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:32.539
What's this about?

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:34.277
Incognito. The hack.

01:04:35.678 --> 01:04:37.347
What about it?

01:04:38.682 --> 01:04:42.249
It was just a stupid bet.
Bragging rights.

01:04:42.251 --> 01:04:44.385
Then things
got out of control.

01:04:44.387 --> 01:04:45.954
You're Incognito?

01:04:45.956 --> 01:04:47.525
One of many.
And lower your voice.

01:04:49.425 --> 01:04:52.426
Is there somebody listening
that I need to be worried about?

01:04:52.428 --> 01:04:54.430
That's always in question.

01:04:56.599 --> 01:04:59.267
Why am I here?

01:04:59.269 --> 01:05:01.705
Seems some members of Incognito
are on Adeline Lilly.

01:05:04.307 --> 01:05:06.610
And you sicced
a serial killer on them.

01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:10.410
You unleashed a psycho

01:05:10.412 --> 01:05:12.347
and people are dying
because of this.

01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:15.783
Four weeks ago, spyware
was installed on your phone.

01:05:15.785 --> 01:05:18.385
Someone's been tracking you.

01:05:18.387 --> 01:05:20.555
You're watching me?

01:05:20.557 --> 01:05:22.789
If the murderer wanted you dead,
you would be.

01:05:22.791 --> 01:05:24.459
He's playing with you.

01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:25.526
It's someone
who's close to you

01:05:25.528 --> 01:05:27.398
or someone
who's fixated on you.

01:05:29.566 --> 01:05:32.399
- What about the videos?
- Not us.

01:05:32.401 --> 01:05:34.401
Just the hack
and leak to the papers.

01:05:34.403 --> 01:05:36.407
Everything else
is your guy.

01:05:37.673 --> 01:05:39.374
Be safe.

01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:41.541
I've increased the security
on your devices

01:05:41.543 --> 01:05:44.012
and as I get more information,
it'll come to you.

01:06:06.836 --> 01:06:10.341
Simon? Jen?

01:06:20.684 --> 01:06:22.253
Jen?

01:06:26.722 --> 01:06:28.291
Simon?

01:06:38.767 --> 01:06:39.800
Jeez, Max.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.407
What the hell are you doing?

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.506
I'm sorry,
I thought you were..

01:06:46.508 --> 01:06:51.079
You thought I was a murderer?
Hiding in a laundry room?

01:06:51.081 --> 01:06:54.318
- Are you kidding me?
- Where's Jen? Is she here?

01:06:55.117 --> 01:06:57.551
I just got home.

01:06:57.553 --> 01:06:59.086
What would Jen be doing
in our house?

01:06:59.088 --> 01:07:03.091
- She and Greg got into a fight.
- Big surprise.

01:07:03.093 --> 01:07:05.660
Honey, can you put
the gun down, please?

01:07:07.097 --> 01:07:08.564
Sorry.

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:17.840
Well, what happened with you?
You're..

01:07:18.874 --> 01:07:20.774
I fell.

01:07:20.776 --> 01:07:23.111
I went running after work.

01:07:23.113 --> 01:07:25.579
It's been a long week.

01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:27.448
'And if you're about
to tell me that Jen'

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:29.916
is gonna be staying with us,
you can just pick your gun

01:07:29.918 --> 01:07:31.619
right back up and put me
out of my misery

01:07:31.621 --> 01:07:32.754
because I, I can't..

01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:35.726
'Sorry.
I'm tired.'

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:40.764
Look, I'm, I'm gonna take
a shower and go to bed. Okay?

01:07:58.847 --> 01:08:00.715
'The body of missing
Adeline Lilly'

01:08:00.717 --> 01:08:03.785
CEO, Dylan Berkis, was found
this morning by a jogger.

01:08:03.787 --> 01:08:06.153
'Her body was bound and left
on the Shenandoah trail'

01:08:06.155 --> 01:08:07.789
sometime late last night.

01:08:07.791 --> 01:08:09.626
Cause of death, unknown.

01:08:15.865 --> 01:08:18.198
Nice of you to join us.

01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:20.504
Sorry, I'm late,
Your Honor.

01:08:22.171 --> 01:08:23.770
Jen?

01:08:23.772 --> 01:08:27.675
So we're all here.
I guess we can begin.

01:08:27.676 --> 01:08:29.776
What are you talking about?

01:08:29.778 --> 01:08:32.879
You are kind of slow.
Aren't you, Max?

01:08:32.881 --> 01:08:35.850
Aw, he's kind of right.

01:08:35.852 --> 01:08:40.488
Tell me right now.
Who is the Charm Killer?

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:41.791
Is it me?

01:08:44.193 --> 01:08:46.225
Or me?

01:08:46.228 --> 01:08:48.462
Or..

01:08:48.464 --> 01:08:49.930
...is it me?

01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:11.752
'The body of missing
Adeline Lilly'

01:09:11.754 --> 01:09:14.821
CEO, Dylan Berkis, was found
this morning by a jogger.

01:09:14.823 --> 01:09:17.225
Her body was bound and left
on the Shenandoah trail

01:09:17.227 --> 01:09:19.430
'sometime late last night.'

01:09:20.629 --> 01:09:23.662
- Morning.
- Hey.

01:09:23.665 --> 01:09:25.667
I'm late.
I gotta go.

01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:29.236
Hey..

01:09:29.238 --> 01:09:31.738
...I'm sorry about last night.

01:09:31.741 --> 01:09:32.843
About the gun.

01:09:35.044 --> 01:09:36.743
It happens, right?

01:09:36.745 --> 01:09:38.011
I mean, not to anyone
that I've ever known

01:09:38.013 --> 01:09:40.515
but that's not the point.

01:09:42.518 --> 01:09:44.720
Can we, can we have
dinner tonight?

01:09:45.854 --> 01:09:48.024
As opposed to not eating?
Sure.

01:09:49.291 --> 01:09:50.925
Simon, come on.
I said I was sorry.

01:09:50.926 --> 01:09:54.662
I know, I know you did.
It's fine. I gotta go.

01:10:06.675 --> 01:10:08.008
'Yeah, I wouldn't bother.
Even if you were here'

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:09.776
they're not letting people
within the 50 feet.

01:10:09.778 --> 01:10:11.878
Except for Mohammed
and the coroners.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.881
Collins is about to do
a press conference.

01:10:13.883 --> 01:10:16.050
That should be intriguing.

01:10:16.052 --> 01:10:17.851
Maybe I should send 'em
to your place, huh?

01:10:17.853 --> 01:10:20.687
I'm sure the FBI
would love that.

01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:22.957
'How're you feeling?
How's Jen?'

01:10:22.959 --> 01:10:26.927
Jen's in a hotel.
She's, you know..

01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:29.062
'She'll be fine.'

01:10:29.064 --> 01:10:31.731
How are you holding up?

01:10:32.802 --> 01:10:34.668
Well, let's see.

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:36.002
I'm being tracked by a killer.

01:10:36.004 --> 01:10:38.806
I pulled a gun on my boyfriend

01:10:38.808 --> 01:10:42.043
who my best friend
is trying to seduce.

01:10:42.045 --> 01:10:45.046
'Plus, I'm paranoid, everyone
I know wants to murder me'

01:10:45.048 --> 01:10:48.785
'but... am I holding up?
Yeah.'

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.120
So, uh, Berkis?
Is there a charm?

01:10:54.122 --> 01:10:56.090
Yeah, there is.
I'm not sure what it is yet.

01:10:56.092 --> 01:10:58.626
Um, but, uh, listen,
Collins is going up right now.

01:10:58.628 --> 01:10:59.860
Let's, uh,
let's talk in a bit, okay?

01:10:59.862 --> 01:11:00.964
'Yep.'

01:11:04.901 --> 01:11:07.368
The events that took place
in Brixton this week

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.736
have shocked us.

01:11:09.738 --> 01:11:11.038
'And we'd like to assure you'

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.106
that we're doing everything
in our power

01:11:13.108 --> 01:11:16.810
to solve this case
and to keep Brixton safe.

01:11:16.812 --> 01:11:19.814
'At this point, I'd like
to introduce Agent Doyle'

01:11:19.816 --> 01:11:22.882
of the FBI, who will be taking
the lead on the case

01:11:22.884 --> 01:11:24.118
from this point forward.

01:11:25.153 --> 01:11:26.721
Please direct your questions

01:11:26.723 --> 01:11:28.091
to Agent Doyle.
Thank you.

01:11:35.764 --> 01:11:38.365
Apparently, she liked
really young men.

01:11:38.367 --> 01:11:40.900
Killer hobbled her,
left her for dead.

01:11:40.902 --> 01:11:42.939
Around dawn,
the cougars got to her.

01:11:44.374 --> 01:11:47.708
Kinda poetic actually..

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:50.614
...if you're into
a sick sort of justice.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.650
Oh, and then there's this.

01:11:56.385 --> 01:11:59.720
I'm not sure what
the significance is exactly.

01:11:59.722 --> 01:12:00.756
Hmm.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:03.092
Scale.

01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:07.197
What does it mean?

01:12:08.798 --> 01:12:11.132
Justice, balance..

01:12:11.134 --> 01:12:14.001
Truth, sexual betrayal.

01:12:14.003 --> 01:12:16.740
Some sort of statement
surrounding infidelity?

01:12:18.741 --> 01:12:20.908
I can't.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.877
This doesn't..

01:12:22.879 --> 01:12:25.082
Something's not
making sense. I'm..

01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:30.152
- What am I not seeing?
- Or where you're not looking?

01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:35.823
I don't know.

01:12:35.825 --> 01:12:38.195
It's like I'm too far
inside of it.

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:43.165
Maybe you should sit this one
out and let the Feds take over.

01:12:45.835 --> 01:12:49.736
If the Feds wanna beat me
to him, they better hurry.

01:12:53.776 --> 01:12:55.876
'I think we should
listen to Mohammed.'

01:12:55.878 --> 01:12:58.479
But don't risk another attack,
Max. It's not worth it.

01:12:58.481 --> 01:13:01.082
I even think
maybe you should leave town.

01:13:01.084 --> 01:13:03.016
It does not matter
where I am or where I go.

01:13:03.018 --> 01:13:04.251
If he wants to find me,
he'll find me.

01:13:04.253 --> 01:13:05.819
- Well, then I'll go with you.
- Where?

01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:07.454
It doesn't matter.
Anywhere. I just..

01:13:07.456 --> 01:13:09.056
I don't want you getting hurt.
I don't want you getting killed.

01:13:09.058 --> 01:13:11.228
- I won't.
- I don't wanna lose you, okay?

01:13:14.062 --> 01:13:16.497
You won't.

01:13:16.499 --> 01:13:19.833
- He doesn't want me dead.
- Not now, but he might.

01:13:19.835 --> 01:13:22.039
But this has gotta end, somehow.

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.912
Another apology
from your boyfriend?

01:13:31.214 --> 01:13:34.748
- Hmph. That's strange.
- What?

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.083
Because I've been texting him
all afternoon

01:13:36.085 --> 01:13:37.217
and he hasn't
gotten back to me.

01:13:37.219 --> 01:13:39.689
Well, open it.
See what it is.

01:13:43.759 --> 01:13:44.794
Ah..

01:13:46.129 --> 01:13:47.160
What is it?
What's..

01:13:47.162 --> 01:13:49.765
Oh.. Oh, hang on. Whoa. Whoa.

01:14:01.544 --> 01:14:04.979
That's Jen's wedding ring.
Oh, my God.

01:14:10.519 --> 01:14:13.854
Friend or enemy?
Hard to tell.

01:14:13.856 --> 01:14:16.824
But it does look like
she's lost a lot of blood now.

01:14:16.826 --> 01:14:18.859
Doesn't it?

01:14:18.861 --> 01:14:21.194
And, really, Max,
the added security

01:14:21.196 --> 01:14:22.997
was not necessary.

01:14:22.999 --> 01:14:24.532
'I mean, come on.'

01:14:24.534 --> 01:14:26.566
What are we doing here?

01:14:26.568 --> 01:14:31.070
If you want the truth,
come alone or no one lives.

01:14:31.072 --> 01:14:35.010
'Red Rover, Red Rover,
bring Maxine on over.'

01:14:37.245 --> 01:14:39.180
Did you not.. No, you're not
going. You're not gonna go..

01:14:39.182 --> 01:14:41.148
If I don't go alone,
he's gonna kill her.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:42.882
Track my phone,
leave in 10 minutes.

01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:43.918
Listen..
I don't, I don't..

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.052
I don't feel good about this.

01:14:45.054 --> 01:14:46.186
I don't care!

01:16:12.974 --> 01:16:14.374
'Adeline!'

01:16:17.914 --> 01:16:19.012
'Go on!'

01:16:24.653 --> 01:16:26.322
'Go on!'

01:16:44.339 --> 01:16:46.409
- Don't move!
- Max.

01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:51.046
No, what's going on?
Where the hell are we?

01:16:52.281 --> 01:16:55.449
How could you do this?
How could you do this?

01:16:55.451 --> 01:16:57.150
- I trusted you.
- How could I do what?

01:16:57.152 --> 01:16:59.019
- I trusted you.
- Just hold on.

01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.154
- Stop pointing that at me.
- Where is Jen?

01:17:01.156 --> 01:17:04.057
J-j-j-just calm down. Just stop
pointing that thing at me.

01:17:04.059 --> 01:17:06.392
- I don't know..
- Where is she?

01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:10.196
Simon?

01:17:12.067 --> 01:17:14.702
- Don't move!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:14.704 --> 01:17:17.337
Relax. It's Nick. It's Nick.
Don't, don't, don't shoot.

01:17:17.339 --> 01:17:21.175
- Did you just shoot the gun?
- What?

01:17:21.177 --> 01:17:23.209
Just now,
did you just shoot Simon?

01:17:23.211 --> 01:17:25.479
No, no, no, no. Just tell me
what's going on? Tell me..

01:17:26.514 --> 01:17:29.084
- Nick!
- Oh. Aah!

01:17:30.452 --> 01:17:35.154
Simon? Simon, what's happening?
Did you do this?

01:17:35.156 --> 01:17:37.490
You really think Simon did this?

01:17:37.492 --> 01:17:40.330
Ah! Ow.

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:44.431
Now, don't fight.

01:17:44.433 --> 01:17:47.970
Get inside
and we'll go for a ride.

01:17:49.205 --> 01:17:51.341
- Get in.
- Ah!

01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:03.986
Greg?

01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:08.324
Hi, Max. Surprise.

01:18:10.558 --> 01:18:13.028
Let's go for that drive.

01:18:30.278 --> 01:18:33.212
You didn't grow up
around here, did you?

01:18:33.214 --> 01:18:34.815
My grandparents
lived up the road.

01:18:34.817 --> 01:18:38.151
That's where I learned
about love and betrayal.

01:18:38.153 --> 01:18:41.254
And loyalty.

01:18:41.256 --> 01:18:43.390
'You've always been loyal.
You have integrity.'

01:18:43.392 --> 01:18:45.225
'And I respect that.'

01:18:45.227 --> 01:18:47.060
You make a plan, a choice,
you stick with it

01:18:47.062 --> 01:18:48.395
no matter what.

01:18:48.397 --> 01:18:49.797
Which brings us
to the question

01:18:49.799 --> 01:18:52.399
you've anxiously
been awaiting.

01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:54.400
Ah.
Make a left.

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.543
'Let's start with Ryan,
shall we?'

01:19:03.545 --> 01:19:06.145
That lowlife vampire
was spreading chlamydia

01:19:06.147 --> 01:19:07.547
from here to Ventura County.

01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:09.315
He was a walking
CDC patient zero.

01:19:09.317 --> 01:19:11.185
I did humanity a favor.

01:19:11.187 --> 01:19:13.486
'Moving onward, we have
the money grubbing preacher'

01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:15.422
who promoted chastity
with thoughts so impure

01:19:15.424 --> 01:19:17.224
self-flagellation
aroused him.

01:19:17.226 --> 01:19:19.258
I know that's a thing,
but I can't quite

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.263
wrap my head around it.

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:27.434
'Then we have the CEO,
who made a fortune'

01:19:27.436 --> 01:19:29.403
facilitating heartbreak
and didn't wanna take

01:19:29.405 --> 01:19:31.337
any responsibility for it.

01:19:31.339 --> 01:19:34.641
Oh, I almost forgot. And there
is the, uh, the surgeon

01:19:34.643 --> 01:19:36.610
with a God complex
who couldn't get it off

01:19:36.612 --> 01:19:39.516
unless his own mortality
was on the brink.

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:43.486
'Pull up right here.'

01:19:46.856 --> 01:19:48.321
Watch your step.

01:19:48.323 --> 01:19:50.858
Uneven ground,
right turn.

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.493
You knew about
my parents, right?

01:19:52.495 --> 01:19:53.627
A bit.

01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:54.660
I'm gonna show you
the trailer

01:19:54.662 --> 01:19:56.329
my mother grew up in.

01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:57.631
Dad, well,
he came from more money.

01:19:57.633 --> 01:19:59.867
Wasn't the nicest guy
in the world though.

01:19:59.869 --> 01:20:03.203
- Keep going.
- He was, um..

01:20:03.205 --> 01:20:04.471
He was murdered.

01:20:04.473 --> 01:20:06.873
Yeah, I assume
you know how.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:09.144
- No.
- No? Oh.

01:20:10.278 --> 01:20:12.214
Down! Down!

01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:17.217
Well, it's an
interesting story.

01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:19.218
So, my mother,
she was a saint.

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:20.654
She was a danky little thing,
a nice woman.

01:20:20.656 --> 01:20:23.524
She was kind, she was sweet,
she was polite.

01:20:23.526 --> 01:20:27.493
My father on the other hand,
well, he was not a good guy.

01:20:27.495 --> 01:20:31.198
He was rude, he was loud,
he was crass.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.234
He took pleasure
in humiliating my mother.

01:20:34.236 --> 01:20:36.369
He would sleep with anyone close
to her, didn't matter who.

01:20:36.371 --> 01:20:39.672
Neighbors, friends,
coworkers, her sister.

01:20:39.674 --> 01:20:41.941
In fact, if she was too nice
to the check-out girl

01:20:41.943 --> 01:20:44.177
at the grocery store,
he would hit on her.

01:20:44.179 --> 01:20:46.548
And then he'd come home later
and boast about his escapades.

01:20:47.515 --> 01:20:49.516
To you?

01:20:49.518 --> 01:20:51.717
To my mother.

01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.520
And if she made one sound
during his little story time

01:20:54.522 --> 01:20:56.489
what's called, he'd hit her,
not the back of the hand

01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:58.324
or open palm,
that kind of a thing

01:20:58.326 --> 01:21:02.195
with a fist. Like you hit
a guy in a bar fight.

01:21:02.197 --> 01:21:03.629
And then the very next day
without fail

01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:06.667
he would give her
a piece of apology jewelry

01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:09.203
and soon as he's off to work,
she would chuck it in the closet

01:21:09.205 --> 01:21:11.274
never to be seen again.

01:21:12.273 --> 01:21:13.974
Except for the charm bracelet.

01:21:13.976 --> 01:21:15.742
Except for the charm bracelet.

01:21:15.744 --> 01:21:17.444
She loved that thing.

01:21:17.446 --> 01:21:19.546
She wore it everyday.
So, I asked her

01:21:19.548 --> 01:21:21.414
"Why do you wear that thing?
Why do you like it so much?"

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:23.249
She said.. I will never forget
it 'cause it was beautiful.

01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:25.552
She said "In another world

01:21:25.554 --> 01:21:28.955
"maybe even right
on top of this one

01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:30.425
"I'm a different me.

01:21:31.527 --> 01:21:33.526
'I'm a happy me."'

01:21:33.528 --> 01:21:36.698
That bracelet is my link
to that world.

01:21:38.968 --> 01:21:41.534
And then one day
she had enough.

01:21:41.536 --> 01:21:43.770
'So, she made me a big
breakfast, blueberry pancakes.'

01:21:43.772 --> 01:21:46.472
It was delicious,
then she sent me off to school

01:21:46.474 --> 01:21:50.243
and she walked into her bedroom
and shot my dad's head off

01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:52.247
with a shotgun
while he was asleep.

01:21:53.514 --> 01:21:55.517
Your mother
is in a mental institution.

01:21:56.986 --> 01:21:58.784
Sunny Oaks.

01:21:58.786 --> 01:22:01.191
She's unfit to stand trial.

01:22:02.457 --> 01:22:04.794
Get up.
Up!

01:22:07.763 --> 01:22:09.732
Open that door.

01:22:12.735 --> 01:22:16.336
Is that your plan?
An insanity plea.

01:22:16.338 --> 01:22:19.306
Nope. My plan is to go out
with a bang.

01:22:25.013 --> 01:22:27.013
Jen! Jen!

01:22:27.015 --> 01:22:28.715
I'm honestly torn

01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:32.752
to let you go and tell my tale
or take you with me.

01:22:32.754 --> 01:22:34.754
How could you do this?

01:22:34.756 --> 01:22:36.823
I always thought
you were the good one.

01:22:36.825 --> 01:22:38.691
Sorry, Max.

01:23:19.567 --> 01:23:23.436
- Hey.
- Uh, I'm not talking to you.

01:23:23.438 --> 01:23:25.071
Do you know how long I've waited
to hear those words

01:23:25.073 --> 01:23:27.309
come out of your mouth?

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:30.776
You're insane.
Mmm.

01:23:30.778 --> 01:23:33.379
Yeah, well,
we make a good team.

01:23:33.381 --> 01:23:35.485
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:23:43.892 --> 01:23:45.695
Seriously Payton?

01:23:47.729 --> 01:23:49.562
Captain?

01:23:49.564 --> 01:23:52.099
What am I supposed
to do about you?

01:23:52.101 --> 01:23:54.700
You know how many people
you piss off?

01:23:54.702 --> 01:23:56.869
A lot.

01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:59.773
And that's why, you will
never leave my precinct.

01:23:59.775 --> 01:24:01.374
Ever.

01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:03.679
Now take a damn vacation,
will you?

01:24:05.113 --> 01:24:06.749
Yes, sir.

01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:25.368
Come here.
