WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:05.839
Morning, thugs.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.075
Morning, gangster.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.709
Morning, player.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.411
Aww,
I love what we have.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.580
Uh-huh.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.316
Uh-huh. Patient.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.119
No, I don't think the only
reason your mother had you

00:18.186 --> 00:20.388
was so that she could be
a bitch to you.

00:20.454 --> 00:24.192
Ah, the holidays,
stockings full of gifts,

00:24.258 --> 00:26.494
your mom's voicemail
full of messages

00:26.560 --> 00:29.297
from sobbing lunatics
who can't handle
their business.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.233
Christmas or not,

00:32.300 --> 00:33.467
you just have to tell
your mother

00:33.534 --> 00:35.002
she has to respect you.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.704
Hey.
Leggings are not pants.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.972
Mom,
you have to respect me.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.941
Don't even.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.810
Look, I know
the holidays can be lonely,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.145
but don't
lose sight of the fact

00:44.212 --> 00:47.047
that you matter
to a lot of people, Jill.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.416
Ellen. I meant Ellen.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.519
She hung up on me.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.621
What a whiner.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.756
I'm so sorry.
I thought you hung up.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.594
Come here.
What can hero husband do
to make it better?

01:00.661 --> 01:03.030
Fast-forward me
to our trip to Hawaii.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.932
(GASPS)
Our couple's massage.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.667
And our couple's bed.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.702
It's just a bed, honey.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.504
It's a bed with
a partially obstructed view

01:10.571 --> 01:11.839
of the hotel parking lot

01:11.905 --> 01:14.175
because that's how
daddy rolls.
(CHUCKLES)

01:14.242 --> 01:16.477
Mom, I'm gonna need
a new bathing suit for Hawaii.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.612
Stuff got real this year.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.015
I need one, too.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.818
I've been tightening up
the front porch.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.521
Hold up, are you guys
under the impression

01:27.588 --> 01:29.490
that you're coming
to Hawaii with us?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.225
Yeah. I mean, aren't we?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.826
You said
you were gonna tell them.

01:32.893 --> 01:33.994
No! Remember?

01:34.061 --> 01:35.363
You said you didn't
want me to tell them

01:35.429 --> 01:37.097
because you thought
I'd enjoy it too much.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.532
No. I said, "Tell them.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.734
"Just don't sound like
you're enjoying it too much."

01:40.801 --> 01:43.103
(LAUGHING) Okay, I'm not
that good an actor.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.273
Wait. What's happening here?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.040
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry, you guys,

01:47.107 --> 01:50.211
but your dad and I
really need a vacation
alone together.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.413
Yeah. We haven't had
time away,
just the two of us,

01:52.480 --> 01:54.582
since your mother had
her emergency appendectomy.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.584
(CHUCKLES) God, that was
a great few days.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.452
It was.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.821
Okay, so, you would
literally rather have surgery

02:00.888 --> 02:02.223
than vacation
with your own children?

02:02.290 --> 02:03.291
Did she stutter?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.994
All right,
all right, all right.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.097
It was a hard decision,
honey, and we're really
gonna miss you guys.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.432
This is so not fair!

02:11.499 --> 02:12.833
I want to learn
how to surf!

02:12.900 --> 02:15.369
And I want to see
how resentful the locals are.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.271
I hear
it's breathtaking!

02:20.241 --> 02:21.442
Look, I'm sorry, guys.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.143
You know, I'm really
torn up about this. (LAUGHS)

02:23.677 --> 02:25.078
Ken!

02:25.145 --> 02:27.348
See? I told you
I'm not that good an actor.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.049
Really?

02:29.116 --> 02:31.118
Gangster gonna play me
like that?

02:42.930 --> 02:45.866
Hey, Clark,
my Jewish friend.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.902
I am neither
of those things,
and don't touch me.

02:48.969 --> 02:53.974
Hey, where would a man
of my ilk get one of those
beanie things?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.577
They're called yarmulkes,
and why do you need one?

02:56.644 --> 02:59.913
Oh, well, Christmas eve,
I'm going to this big singles
party, the Matzo Ball.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.148
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.451
Hoping to put my noodle
in some kugel

03:03.517 --> 03:05.486
(CHUCKLING) If you know
what I mean.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.622
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I'm...
I'm talking about hosin'
one of the chosen.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.691
(LAUGHING) Get it?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.360
Oh, come on.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.028
Your people are famous
for your sense of humor.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.465
The gay,
Lutheran vegans?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.766
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, that's the stuff!

03:20.534 --> 03:21.802
Um, Pat.
Huh?

03:21.869 --> 03:22.970
I need
to talk to you.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.572
I have to request
a day off.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.775
Oh, sorry. That's not
my jurisdiction,
but would you like a raise?

03:27.841 --> 03:28.876
Sure.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.811
No. (CHUCKLES)

03:30.878 --> 03:32.480
See? I'm happy
to help you with that.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.850
Listen, don't worry about it.
Just talk to Damona.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.052
Damona decides
who gets vacation days?

03:39.119 --> 03:41.255
Nah. It's this hard-ass,
Phil Stockton.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.856
He's the master scheduler.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.426
He manages the schedules
for the entire medical staff.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.627
Then maybe
I'll just talk to him.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.795
Doesn't work that way.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.129
Yeah. Nobody in our department

03:49.196 --> 03:50.331
talks to him
except for Damona.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.366
She is our liaison.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.402
Well,
that seems inefficient...

03:54.468 --> 03:56.437
And unnecessarily French.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.707
You haven't met Phil.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.241
You know
Dr. Ken's temper?

04:01.309 --> 04:02.410
Picture that on a man.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.680
That is scary.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.149
One time,
Dr. Miller broke protocol

04:09.216 --> 04:11.552
and asked Phil for the day off
for his kid's birthday.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.454
Not only
did he not get the day,

04:13.521 --> 04:16.123
but he ended up
having to work
on Thanksgiving.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.559
Then, two weeks later,
his car blew up.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.764
Fuel-line issue, unrelated,
but still!

04:23.831 --> 04:26.600
All right.
I won't talk to him.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.236
Damona,
would you please ask Phil

04:29.303 --> 04:31.104
if I could have
Valentine's Day off?

04:31.171 --> 04:32.540
I thought you and Topher
broke up.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.841
Oh, no, we did.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.209
But I figure I'll either
be back together with him

04:36.276 --> 04:38.546
or eating myself to death
in his shrubs.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.817
Regardless,
I'm gonna need the day.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.520
I'll talk to Phil.
It shouldn't be a problem
since you got it in early.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.656
Yeah, gots to
keep it timely, people.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.824
That's why I asked
for my days off months ago.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.992
Wait. Which days?

04:52.059 --> 04:55.062
You know, for my
New Year's trip to Hawaii.

04:55.128 --> 05:00.200
Where?
Oh, sweet, contiguous,
landlocked Julie.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.536
That's the native
pronunciation of "Hawaii,"

05:02.603 --> 05:04.638
The island paradise
where my wife and I

05:04.705 --> 05:06.440
will be enjoying
our most relaxed time

05:06.507 --> 05:08.008
since her appendectomy.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.242
And hopefully this time,

05:09.309 --> 05:12.380
she won't be stingy
with the lovin', you know?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.616
(MOCKINGLY) "Oh, Ken,
watch the stitches!

05:15.683 --> 05:18.619
"There's another patient
in the room!"

05:18.686 --> 05:21.655
Hold up. Dr. Ken,
you didn't tell me to
ask Phil for New Year's off.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.525
(LAUGHS) Okay, Damona,
let's leave the comedy

05:24.592 --> 05:26.093
to the guy
who was awarded the mug

05:26.159 --> 05:27.895
that said
"world's funniest doctor."

05:27.961 --> 05:30.398
Awarded?
You made that yourself
at Color Me Mine.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.468
I'm serious, little man.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.903
You never
put in a request.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.706
Yes, I did.
I filled it out, I stuck it
in my lab-coat pocket,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.974
and I gave it to you.
You obviously lost it.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.175
If I may?

05:45.513 --> 05:48.081
And not to pile on,
but you did not
fill that out, either.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.219
Come on. Allison already
booked the flights to Hawaii.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.022
I thought it was
pronounced Hawaii.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.624
I think that's just
when you're going.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.428
Come on, Damona, please.
I need those days.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.095
Hey, hey,
don't put that on me.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.465
It's not my responsibility
to check your damn pocket.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.969
It is actually mine.
I am very sorry, sir.
Okay.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.740
Hey.
Trouble in not-paradise?

06:12.806 --> 06:15.976
So, what's the
return policy on that
youth-sized snorkel set

06:16.043 --> 06:17.277
you were sure
you'd grow into?

06:26.520 --> 06:28.355
Dave,
tighten up those arms.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.457
That is your food.
Protect it!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.026
What's going on here?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.563
Oh, just preparing Dave
for foster care, you know,

06:35.629 --> 06:39.366
because you and Dad
are abandoning us.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.835
Okay, now there's
a big kid trying
to take your corn bread.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.504
Quick, fork in the eye!

06:43.571 --> 06:45.305
Stay away, Tracy!

06:45.839 --> 06:46.840
(GROWLS)

06:47.975 --> 06:50.310
Nice try.
You're still not coming.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.279
Fine. I didn't want
to resort to this.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.515
Dave, plan B.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.623
Really? We're supposed to
take you guys to Hawaii

07:02.690 --> 07:04.124
because Dave's
making a sad face?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.095
Okay, Dave, cut it out.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.299
Oh, baby,
are you okay?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.169
Oh, nope. Nope.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.437
Not falling for it.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.177
We'll get there.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.079
Just keep working
that money-maker.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.215
(SNARLS)

07:28.281 --> 07:29.750
Not the fork, the face.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.660
Hey, bae.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.795
Guess what I just booked
for Hawaii!
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:41.862 --> 07:44.998
A private boat that takes us
to swim with the dolphins.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.100
Then it docks
on a secluded beach,

07:47.167 --> 07:50.170
where the two of us
are served a five-star meal
at sunset.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.872
They force you
to eat at sunset?

07:51.939 --> 07:53.841
I mean,
sounds pretty rigid.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.844
Really? 'Cause, to me,
it sounds like
the best day of our lives.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.378
The excursion
is literally called

07:58.445 --> 08:00.147
"the best day
of your life."

08:01.615 --> 08:03.951
Al, Hawaii's great and all,
but I was thinking,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.318
maybe we should
stay home.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.855
You know, I think
we're gonna miss the kids.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.790
You son of a bitch.
You didn't get the days off.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.592
No! No! No.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.962
I'm simply
opening my heart

08:15.028 --> 08:17.164
about how much
I'm gonna miss our children.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.799
I swear to God.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.434
I planned this whole trip,
and you had one thing to do!

08:21.501 --> 08:22.636
Which I did!

08:22.703 --> 08:24.037
I mean... Wow.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.039
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, wow. Okay.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.775
Uh, this hurts, Allison.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.109
This really hurts.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.281
Ken,
I really need this trip.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.416
Please tell me
you got the days off.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.119
(SIGHS)

08:44.725 --> 08:46.226
I got the days off.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.562
Oh, thank God!

08:48.629 --> 08:49.897
(LAUGHS)

08:49.963 --> 08:52.733
I would've been
so mad.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.101
(LAUGHING) I know!

08:55.502 --> 08:57.237
I mean,
I only had one thing to do!

08:57.304 --> 08:58.839
Come on! (LAUGHS)

08:58.906 --> 09:00.808
Oh, my God,
this is gonna be so amazing!

09:00.874 --> 09:02.776
Okay, so, are you in
for the dolphin thing?

09:02.843 --> 09:03.977
Oh, I'm in. (LAUGHS)

09:04.845 --> 09:06.379
I'm in so deep.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.449
Confirm. Confirm.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.418
Non-refundable.
Confirm.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.588
Okay, do you want
the creme brulee
or the cherries jubilee?

09:14.655 --> 09:15.923
Dealer's choice.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.357
All right.
Oh, my God.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.659
Champagne,
lobster breakfast.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.860
Should we splurge?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.462
Ooh-hoo!
Ah! Yes!

09:22.529 --> 09:24.832
Yes! Come on.
Come on.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.667
Yolo.
Yolo!

09:26.734 --> 09:28.501
(LAUGHS)
(WHIMPERS)

09:33.941 --> 09:35.676
I'm officially screwed.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.978
At some point during
our romantic trip to Hawaii,

09:38.045 --> 09:40.848
Allison's gonna notice
I'm not there.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.150
I'm guessing that'll be
the highlight of her trip.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.254
What is this, casual Friday?

09:47.320 --> 09:50.457
No. It's "the attire of places
Ken's not going" Friday.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.761
Next week,
I'm dressing as heaven.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.230
(SIGHS)
I talked to Phil.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.566
What did he say?
It's still
a big, fat no.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.134
(SIGHS)
But... But I have an idea.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.370
Here's a list
of all the doctors
that have New Year's off.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.206
Just go and see
if any of them are interested
in swapping.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.507
Swapping?

10:07.574 --> 10:09.677
Uh, how do I know
what their wives look like?

10:11.779 --> 10:15.148
Swapping vacation days,
not wives, you dumb bucket.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.217
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, of course.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.787
You know, Allison's
a cool chick and all,
and it has come up,

10:19.853 --> 10:22.089
but that was mostly me
driving it, you know?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.324
I'm gonna go
take care of this.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.159
Ah! Morgan's wife's not bad.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.231
Let me
get this straight.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.833
You raised this girl,

10:32.900 --> 10:34.234
she's a grown woman,

10:34.301 --> 10:37.771
and she can't even
walk down an aisle by herself?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.572
You can go hike
a glacier anytime.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.009
Trust me.
They're gonna be
around forever.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.144
All I'm saying is,
if you schedule it,

10:44.211 --> 10:46.313
you could drop that thing
before the New Year.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.681
That's a huge
tax write-off.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.219
Your mom's
being difficult.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.555
(SIGHS) Congratulations.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.396
Oh, hey, Allison.
What are you doing here?

11:03.463 --> 11:05.198
I came to surprise Ken
with lunch.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.101
I brought Hawaiian barbecue,
you know, 'cause of our trip.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.402
So, you're going?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.504
Yeah. Wait,
what are you talking about?

11:11.571 --> 11:15.408
Oh. I just thought
that since
Ken forgot to ask for the...

11:15.475 --> 11:17.544
Stop talking, Julie.
I can't. I'm too nervous.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.079
Well,
then change the subject.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.015
Oh, there he is!

11:22.082 --> 11:24.051
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Guess who's here, Dr. Ken.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.886
Hey, bae.
You lied to me.

11:25.953 --> 11:29.556
What?
You never asked
for the days off. I knew it.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.891
Wait. Wait.
Just let me explain!

11:33.794 --> 11:35.829
Wow, I did not
expect you to stop.
I got nothing.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.171
(SINGSONG VOICE)
But you still have BBQ.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.418
You know what?
I'm not gonna take this.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.587
I'm gonna go dance
with the devil.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.822
What does that mean?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.991
Oh, that's just
Dr. Ken's dramatic way
of saying

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
he's gonna fix things
with Allison.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.527
No.
Allison's not the devil.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.662
Phil is.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.398
I did not
get that at all.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.969
Just look in the directory
and find his office, please.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.371
Uh, he is
on the 14th floor,

12:18.438 --> 12:20.273
but I think
that this is a terrible idea.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.509
I mean, you're talking about
the man who made Dr. O'Brien

12:22.575 --> 12:24.477
work the day after
his own funeral.

12:26.046 --> 12:30.984
Okay, that may have been
an urban legend, but still...

12:31.051 --> 12:33.653
Look, I refuse to live
in fear of this guy.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.388
I'm gonna go
demand my days,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.424
and I'm not gonna take "no"
for an answer.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.759
I'm not even gonna
take "maybe" for an answer.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.595
Other answers
I won't accept include
"I'll think about it,"

12:42.662 --> 12:43.931
or "I'll get back
to you."

12:43.997 --> 12:45.165
So, just to recap,

12:45.232 --> 12:47.835
I'm looking for "yes,"
"sure," or "definitely."

12:47.901 --> 12:51.338
Or, if need be,
I'll even take a
"10-4, good buddy."

12:55.475 --> 12:56.643
Good luck, pal.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.111
I will not
be rooting for you.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.655
Too much?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.758
Yeah,
it's too much.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.565
Hey, anybody seen Dr. Ken?
His 12:00 canceled.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.600
He went upstairs
to talk to Phil.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.835
Phil Stockton?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.803
He went to talk
to Phil Stockton?

13:23.871 --> 13:27.140
I know. I tried to warn him,
but he seemed very determined.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.876
There's like
five or six things

13:28.942 --> 13:31.378
that he is not gonna take
for an answer.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.613
Oh, God, I knew it!
I knew it!

13:33.680 --> 13:35.916
Oh, God!
You knew what?
You knew what?

13:37.684 --> 13:40.888
Phil Stockton isn't
the master scheduler, okay?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.555
What? Who is?

13:42.622 --> 13:43.623
I am.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.360
Le twist!

13:50.030 --> 13:53.200
But wait. If you're
the master scheduler,
then who's Phil Stockton?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.634
I picked him
out of the directory.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.304
He's just some random guy
from environmental services

13:57.370 --> 14:00.173
who's about to be
all kinds of confused.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.409
Phil Stockton?
Yes?

14:02.475 --> 14:06.346
I'm Dr. Ken Park,
and I'm taking the week
of New Year's off.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.418
Okay.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.953
Really? You're...
You're okay with that?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.121
Sure.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.323
Oh, my God. (CHUCKLES)

14:17.424 --> 14:18.558
(SNIFFLES)

14:18.625 --> 14:20.327
I'm gonna...

14:20.393 --> 14:22.095
You have no idea
what you've done for me.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.831
Not a clue. (CHUCKLES)

14:24.898 --> 14:27.167
See, I lied to my wife,
but then she found out,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.502
and Damona said
you would never...
You know what?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.238
I'm gonna do something
for you.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.705
Mm-hmm. Here.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.908
This is like
a couple hundred bucks.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.245
And this is my
Saddle Burger giddyup card.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.148
Seven barn burgers away
from a free barn burger.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.449
No, I can't
take your money.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.118
Oh, no, I insist.
You take it
'cause you are a saint.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.921
What are you doing?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.156
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:49.222 --> 14:50.823
Oh. We don't
have to do this.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.959
I love you, man.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.927
Thanks.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.738
Well, I just had
an interesting conversation
with Phil,

15:05.805 --> 15:07.274
the master scheduler.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.142
Uh, um, what did...
What did he say?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.543
He said...
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:10.610 --> 15:11.844
Whoa. Hang on.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.215
Hey, Al, I got the days!

15:15.282 --> 15:16.516
Dr. Ken!
No! No!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.385
No, I'm serious. I talked
to the master scheduler.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.652
Dr. Ken, I...
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

15:19.719 --> 15:21.188
(GROANS)
Oh, I know.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.424
I am so sorry about the lying
and the up and back,

15:24.491 --> 15:27.527
but you can relax now
'cause we're going to Hawaii!

15:27.594 --> 15:29.762
(LAUGHS) I know!
I feel the same way!

15:29.829 --> 15:32.465
And you know what, Al?
Screw it.
Let's bring the kids.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.900
I don't even...
Wait. Wait.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.368
Oh, wait.
Another call.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.004
Chello.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.605
Hang up
the damn phone!

15:40.607 --> 15:43.110
I'm the master scheduler.
You don't have the days!

15:43.977 --> 15:45.112
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

15:45.178 --> 15:46.613
(STAMMERING) Oh, honey,
I got to go.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.016
It's an emergency.
It's a code maroon 5.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.420
What the hell is going on?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.488
You're the master scheduler?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.390
Why would you even
mess with me like that?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.659
Okay, look, four years ago,
when they made me
office manager,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.695
they dumped the scheduling job
on me, and...

16:02.762 --> 16:04.998
I liked it
'cause I was helping people.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.600
You like
helping people?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.970
I like
helping people.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.240
I just don't like
people to know
I like helping people

16:13.306 --> 16:14.974
'cause then people
want you to help them.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.612
So I made up
an alter ego.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.150
Like Bruce Wayne
has Batman.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.819
So, in this scenario,
she's a rich dude
with a leather fetish?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.357
Because
that's intriguing.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.298
Hey, did I not give him
the long weekend
for his dad's birthday?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.533
And you're gonna be kissing
or stalking your boyfriend

16:40.600 --> 16:42.435
on Valentine's Day
'cause of me.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.638
Thanks, either way.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.174
And what about
when you needed
those three days

16:47.240 --> 16:49.008
to mourn Joan Rivers?

16:49.076 --> 16:52.779
Three days?
Hey, she paved the way
for so many comediennes!

16:52.845 --> 16:55.582
I mean, without her,
there's no Rudner,
there's no Poundstone.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.218
You know what? I'm sorry.
Please go on.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.754
It doesn't even matter
because every once in a while,

17:01.821 --> 17:06.393
I can't help somebody
I really want to help,
and it sucks.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.927
Look, Damona,
it's not your fault.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.231
I mean, am I gonna
blame you publicly for it?
Absolutely.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.302
My wife's gonna hate me,
my kids are gonna hate me.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.036
I mean, the only one
who doesn't hate me

17:17.104 --> 17:18.905
is some boob
in environmental services

17:18.971 --> 17:22.209
who I just gave 200 bucks to,
and my giddyup card!

17:23.976 --> 17:25.845
Environmental services!
That's it!

17:26.446 --> 17:27.547
Wait for me.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.584
Not a lot of patients
got seen today.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.021
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

17:35.088 --> 17:38.225
Hey, Phil. Damona Watkins,
fifth-floor office manager.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.128
Ken Park. We hugged recently,
and there may
have been a kiss.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.831
Oh, I'm certain there was.

17:44.897 --> 17:49.001
You took my money,
my giddyup card,
and my heart.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.305
You done?
Yep.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.309
So, Phil, your department's
closing the building

17:56.376 --> 17:58.378
for four days in March
to fumigate.
Am I right?

17:58.445 --> 18:01.281
Oh, yeah. We call it
the "pestic-ides of March."

18:02.615 --> 18:04.584
(CHUCKLES)
We like to have fun up here.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.554
Well, look,
my friend is in a bind.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.921
I really want
to help him.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.824
So, why don't you move it
to New Year's week?

18:11.891 --> 18:14.327
Oof. That's a lot
of departments to coordinate.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.429
Well, you best get
to coordinatin', son!

18:16.496 --> 18:17.930
My bad. You got this.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.568
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can swing it.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.170
Let me
ask you a question.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.871
Doesn't Jeff Scarborough
schedule your vacation days?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.307
That's right.
Well, I just talked
to my good friend Jeff,

18:27.374 --> 18:30.343
and he told me you like
to take a week off in July

18:30.410 --> 18:32.712
to go fishing
with your family.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.782
Man, I'd sure hate
to see that go away.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.484
Yeah, boy!

18:39.051 --> 18:41.854
You mean his trip,
not his family, right?

18:41.921 --> 18:45.925
I, uh... I guess
I could move
some things around.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.428
Yeah. You do that, Phil,
or say goodbye
to your family.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.496
What?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.432
Could...
Could you just go...

18:52.499 --> 18:54.234
Okay. It wasn't clear.
No, I didn't...
I didn't know...

18:54.301 --> 18:55.902
I mean, I didn't know
if it was the trip
or his family...

18:55.968 --> 18:57.570
Phil.
It was the trip, right?

18:57.637 --> 18:58.771
(DOOR CLOSES)

18:58.838 --> 19:00.807
Thank you so much.
You saved my ass.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.742
Oh, it's all good.
(SIGHS)

19:02.809 --> 19:04.977
So, how do you know
Jeff Scarborough?
I don't.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.215
Aw, you stone-cold!

19:08.281 --> 19:09.382
(LAUGHS)

19:13.119 --> 19:14.554
How did it go?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.123
Mmm... Trip's back on.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.460
Aah! And Christmas came early
to Welltopia that year.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.298
Poi, anyone?
Ken, come on.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.234
This might be
as close as you get.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.069
Relax, Pat.
I'm going to Hawaii
after all.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.438
Damn it!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.840
I got three gallons
of prank poi in my office

19:33.906 --> 19:36.209
and the entire first season
of Magnum, P.I.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.646
I was gonna slip it
into your car.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.415
Well, the poi, that is,
not the Magnum, P.I.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.484
No,
the Magnum, P.I.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.153
I was gonna broadcast
on the side of your house.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.826
Okay, look,
we're the only ones
who know Damona's secret,

19:53.893 --> 19:55.161
and we're gonna
keep that way,

19:55.228 --> 19:56.996
I mean, 'cause she's always
taken care of us,

19:57.063 --> 19:59.332
and we're gonna
take care of her.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.168
Absolutely.
She's Batman.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.237
Damn straight
I'm Batman.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.039
I guess that makes me
the Joker, huh?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.341
Huh? The...

20:18.084 --> 20:21.288
Oh, my God,
this was so worth it.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.190
Ahh, I know. (GIGGLES)

20:24.257 --> 20:25.558
Sorry.
I'm a little ticklish.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.262
I really needed this.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.498
Gregory,
your fingers are magic.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.834
Dave,
can you please be quiet?

20:34.901 --> 20:38.204
Sorry. I didn't mean to ruin
our couple's massage.

20:38.271 --> 20:42.475
It's four people.
It is not
a couple's massage.

20:42.542 --> 20:47.046
I know, but Gregory's hands
are making me stupid.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.616
Ahh.
