01:18.815 --> 01:21.095
We're shooting a film.

01:21.185 --> 01:24.285
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:26.158 --> 01:27.158
Move.

01:48.786 --> 01:52.090
- Let me explain, it's very
simple. We pretend to rob you.

01:52.091 --> 01:53.658
- Get out of the car slowly
with your hands in the air.

01:53.659 --> 01:54.859
Just like you've seen in the movies.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.296
Come on, come on.

01:56.297 --> 01:57.830
I want you to put the money in the van.

01:57.831 --> 02:00.021
The money in the van!

02:00.102 --> 02:02.769
Come on, come on. Show some enthusiasm.

02:02.770 --> 02:05.573
- So now we're making
gangster films, are we?

02:05.574 --> 02:08.844
- Why not? I'm fed up with movies
about factories and construction sites.

02:08.845 --> 02:11.647
- Still, when it comes to action
scenes you can't beat the Americans.

02:11.648 --> 02:12.878
You bastard!

02:14.618 --> 02:18.808
- Don't worry, we're
just making a film!

02:33.742 --> 02:38.562
- I've never seen anything
like that, have you?

02:39.383 --> 02:40.451
- See you.
- Bye.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.452
Goodnight.

03:16.329 --> 03:20.366
- Lord, in thy great
bounty screw the Bolsheviks.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.869
Give them every disease
in the world, ruin them.

03:22.870 --> 03:28.280
Burn their houses and send
them back to Moscow. Amen.

03:31.481 --> 03:34.686
Did you, did you hear any of that?

03:34.687 --> 03:36.253
No, Mr. Moritz, sir. Nothing.

03:36.254 --> 03:39.291
- Yeah, good. In my
house, the tenant is deaf.

03:39.292 --> 03:40.960
If he starts to hear, we raise the rent.

03:40.961 --> 03:42.428
Leave him be, Moritz.

03:42.429 --> 03:44.069
So what already?

03:44.231 --> 03:46.432
What can I do to him anyway?

03:46.433 --> 03:49.303
He's young, he's down from the north

03:49.304 --> 03:52.907
his parents are poor,
his future is golden.

03:52.908 --> 03:57.013
One day they'll stick a
party-card in his pocket and boom!

03:57.014 --> 03:58.615
We'll all be at his mercy!

03:58.616 --> 04:00.550
Don't mind him. He's old and crazy.

04:00.551 --> 04:01.921
That is true.

04:02.387 --> 04:05.991
I bought my mentally handicapped
certificate 10 years ago.

04:05.992 --> 04:07.023
They can't touch me anymore.

04:07.024 --> 04:08.934
Have some potatoes.

04:08.961 --> 04:12.431
It drives me mad
seeing him there all day

04:12.432 --> 04:14.333
with his ear glued to
that rattling old radio.

04:14.334 --> 04:15.702
She's so sweet.

04:15.703 --> 04:18.373
It's called the "Voice of America"

04:18.374 --> 04:20.541
and it's jammed by the Bolsheviks.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.745
And guess what I saw this morning?

04:22.746 --> 04:25.681
A film shoot! On Martyrs'
Square, right outside the canteen.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.318
- They were making a movie.
- What movie?

04:27.319 --> 04:30.621
- Action movie, with gangsters,
and cars, and gunfire.

04:30.622 --> 04:32.690
- And dames?
- There was one woman.

04:32.691 --> 04:34.626
She was shooting a machine gun.

04:34.627 --> 04:36.987
- Jean Harlow.
- Sorry?

04:37.297 --> 04:40.117
Jean Harlow, big movie star.

04:40.334 --> 04:42.771
Made some famous films before the war.

04:42.772 --> 04:45.004
They don't make films
like that any more.

04:45.005 --> 04:47.710
As if you ever went to the movies.

04:47.711 --> 04:52.082
- I don't need to. I read
the papers, I see the titles.

04:52.083 --> 04:56.319
"The Third Man," "The
Seventh Seal," "12 Angry Men."

04:56.320 --> 04:57.922
All those numbers make your head spin!

04:57.923 --> 05:00.923
Th
- "The Cranes Are Flying."

05:01.026 --> 05:03.329
Now, I never knew they could do that.

05:03.330 --> 05:08.000
"Singing in the Rain," now th - that's
how a cousin of mine died, pneumonia.

05:08.001 --> 05:11.321
"An American in Paris," big deal!

05:12.809 --> 05:15.811
Now, if it were
Bucharest instead of Paris

05:15.812 --> 05:20.517
and not alone, but with
10, no, 20 tank divisions

05:20.518 --> 05:22.720
that I would rush to see.

05:22.721 --> 05:23.921
Here, let me show you something.

05:23.922 --> 05:29.922
Here are some of the films and
stars we had before the war.

06:13.683 --> 06:16.323
- Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:17.456 --> 06:18.456
Move.

06:23.764 --> 06:28.664
- Carefully, carefully.
Take this one here first.

06:29.603 --> 06:32.506
Quickly. We don't have all day.

06:32.507 --> 06:34.776
Put these here in the back.

06:34.777 --> 06:36.779
Yeah, these two here.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.680
Good morning, Maestro Flaviu.

06:38.681 --> 06:39.815
Morning, morning.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.187
- What are we shooting today?
- The parade rehearsal.

06:43.188 --> 06:45.757
- What parade?
- The Liberation Day Parade.

06:45.758 --> 06:49.448
You don't say. Is it August already?

07:00.076 --> 07:03.036
Do I know you from somewhere?

07:03.847 --> 07:05.715
Do me a favor, will you?

07:05.716 --> 07:09.185
Run over to the shop around the corner

07:09.186 --> 07:11.722
and buy me a bottle of vodka.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.903
Moskovskaya.

07:13.091 --> 07:14.821
Wait. Wait, wait.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.964
Are you doing anything today?

07:17.965 --> 07:19.700
Well, you are now.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.833
Pour the vodka into this thermos

07:21.834 --> 07:24.838
put it in your pocket and give
it to me whenever I ask for it.

07:24.839 --> 07:27.799
And never ever leave my side.

07:27.843 --> 07:29.533
Off you go then.

07:29.844 --> 07:31.534
Go on, fuck off!

07:49.738 --> 07:52.528
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, stop.

07:54.043 --> 07:55.863
Five minute break.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.431
We're finished.

08:00.584 --> 08:05.464
Pack the gear up and
I'll meet you at the van.

08:16.772 --> 08:18.138
What's that lens called?

08:18.139 --> 08:21.074
It's a zoom. It's the latest thing.

08:21.075 --> 08:23.579
- Three lei to look through it.
- Up yours!

08:23.580 --> 08:25.915
- I should charge you
just to stand next to it.

08:25.916 --> 08:27.516
Okay, I'm game.

08:32.924 --> 08:34.384
No, no. There.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Move in.

08:37.864 --> 08:40.044
- Yeah.
- Nice, nice.

08:42.336 --> 08:45.566
Come on. Look at those knockers.

08:47.342 --> 08:49.811
Sure, scratch your
little ass. Feels good?

08:49.812 --> 08:53.049
- Hey, Virgil! The boss
wants to see you. Now.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.960
- Sorry, time's up.
- What..

08:56.354 --> 08:57.354
Come in.

08:58.657 --> 09:01.893
The young man we told you about.

09:01.894 --> 09:05.097
Comrade Holban of the
State Security Service.

09:05.098 --> 09:07.000
This is your lucky day, sonny.

09:07.001 --> 09:08.269
The comrades have given us a mission.

09:08.270 --> 09:12.706
We're going to make a short film
about a rather, special event.

09:12.707 --> 09:14.842
All our cameramen are busy
on the parade right now.

09:14.843 --> 09:18.681
So Maestro Flaviu and I have decided
it was time you took the plunge.

09:18.682 --> 09:22.002
You start the day after tomorrow.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.923
- I - Comrades,
you've made the right decision!

09:25.924 --> 09:28.226
- You don't say!
- It's a great honor and, and

09:28.227 --> 09:31.964
and I - I solemnly swear not to
disappoint you.

09:31.965 --> 09:34.098
Hardly a great start.

09:34.099 --> 09:36.703
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

09:36.704 --> 09:42.704
You'll need some preparation, given
the rather special nature of the film.

09:44.147 --> 09:48.419
- Radoiu Maximilian, Dorneanu
Dumitru, Orodel Razvan

09:48.420 --> 09:51.455
Ristea Yorgu, and Bercovich Alice

09:51.456 --> 09:55.460
are charged with attacking and
robbing, on August 15th, 1959

09:55.461 --> 09:58.763
a National Bank of Romania
car, while it delivered funds

09:58.764 --> 10:02.034
to the branch located at
Number 13, Martyrs' Square.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.204
Opposite the maternity
hospital at number -

10:04.205 --> 10:09.912
Are these the masks they were
wearing in Martyrs' Square?

10:09.913 --> 10:10.913
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.982
- Witnesses, do you
stand by the statements

10:12.983 --> 10:14.852
you made during the investigation?

10:14.853 --> 10:15.885
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:15.886 --> 10:18.989
- You think this is
funny, you piece of scum?

10:18.990 --> 10:20.357
You're having a good time?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.729
Comrade prosecutor, your summation.

10:22.730 --> 10:25.931
- On the morning of
the 15th of August, 1959

10:25.932 --> 10:29.837
5 bloodthirsty hyenas
were stalking their prey.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.006
A car belonging to
the National State Bank

10:32.007 --> 10:34.142
delivering 2 million lei in payroll

10:34.143 --> 10:37.948
for thousands of decent,
hardworking communists.

10:37.949 --> 10:41.117
Armed with pistols and machine guns

10:41.118 --> 10:43.385
they violently attacked a driver

10:43.386 --> 10:46.822
and a security agent, both unarmed.

10:46.823 --> 10:48.794
The crowd was thrown
into a state of panic.

10:48.795 --> 10:51.062
Innocent bystanders were wounded.

10:51.063 --> 10:53.466
Gunshots were heard in our capital

10:53.467 --> 10:55.802
for the first time since the war.

10:55.803 --> 10:59.006
And it's no accident that
these Barbarians carried out

10:59.007 --> 11:02.243
their heinous acts in
front of a maternity ward

11:02.244 --> 11:06.382
where our innocent babies bravely
greet their socialist future.

11:06.383 --> 11:09.352
It is obvious that these
criminals were in the pay of

11:09.353 --> 11:12.122
foreign imperialists and Zionists

11:12.123 --> 11:17.863
and have a deep hatred of our
country's socialist institutions.

11:17.864 --> 11:20.400
The people demand the harshest sentence

11:20.401 --> 11:23.503
for every one of these
saboteurs and traitors!

11:23.504 --> 11:26.241
The people demand an example be set!

11:26.242 --> 11:28.210
Comrade judge, the people demand

11:28.211 --> 11:32.071
the execution of these infamous snakes!

11:35.319 --> 11:38.321
Comrade judge, Honorable Court.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.891
We kindly ask you to
take into consideration

11:40.892 --> 11:43.428
the fact that the 5 defendants admit

11:43.429 --> 11:46.499
and sincerely regret their actions.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.000
They are educated people.

11:49.338 --> 11:52.307
Each of them a respected professional.

11:52.308 --> 11:53.578
Unfortunately

11:54.844 --> 11:57.512
I just wanted you to take
that into consideration.

11:57.513 --> 11:58.563
Thank you.

11:59.182 --> 12:00.412
The verdict!

12:02.319 --> 12:05.890
The Military Tribunal of the
People's Republic of Romania

12:05.891 --> 12:09.059
on this day, the 17th
day of August, 1960

12:09.060 --> 12:12.430
decides, the accused,
Radoiu Rosenthal, Maximilian

12:12.431 --> 12:15.535
is found guilty of
conspiring against the state

12:15.536 --> 12:18.938
criminal acts of terror,
armed robbery of public funds.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.944
The court sentences the accused
to death by firing squad.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.548
The accused Bercovich,
Alice is found guilty

12:25.549 --> 12:28.318
of conspiracy against the
state, criminal acts of terror.

12:28.319 --> 12:31.222
The court sentences the accused
to death by firing squad.

12:31.223 --> 12:35.627
Auerbach Dorneanu, Dumitru is found
guilty of conspiracy against the state.

12:35.628 --> 12:38.932
The court sentences the accused
to death by firing squad.

12:38.933 --> 12:39.933
Yeah.

12:40.635 --> 12:45.605
- Orvitz Orodel, Razvan is found
guilty of conspiracy against the state

12:45.606 --> 12:49.913
criminal acts of terror
to death by firing squad.

12:49.914 --> 12:52.480
The accused Feldiman Ristea, Yorgu

12:52.481 --> 12:54.517
is found guilty of
criminal acts of terror

12:54.518 --> 12:56.319
armed robbery of public funds.

12:56.320 --> 13:02.059
The court sentences the accused
to death by firing squad!

13:02.060 --> 13:04.664
I see the accused are
not requesting an appeal

13:04.665 --> 13:10.665
and declare that these sentences
are definitive and irrevocable!

13:11.240 --> 13:13.539
- I'm afraid it's a little
early for celebration.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.575
Your job is far from being over.

13:15.576 --> 13:17.512
The comrades from the
ministry have decided..

13:17.513 --> 13:21.113
Thank you, my dear, you can go now.

13:21.251 --> 13:26.056
Have decided that the trial
will actually be only one scene

13:26.057 --> 13:29.287
in a rather more elaborate film.

13:29.595 --> 13:31.163
You mean it won't be on the newsreel?

13:31.164 --> 13:32.164
No.

13:34.034 --> 13:35.435
These sleepless nights are killing me.

13:35.436 --> 13:39.038
I take all kinds of
pills, no effect at all.

13:39.039 --> 13:42.319
Now then, our mission is to make

13:43.312 --> 13:45.615
an educational feature,
a rather special one.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.117
In fact, it will be a detailed
reconstruction of the events

13:48.118 --> 13:51.587
that took place last year,
the robbery, the investigation

13:51.588 --> 13:54.591
and the arrests, I'm
giving each of you a file

13:54.592 --> 13:57.682
that contains all the elements.

14:06.475 --> 14:08.743
- What the hell are we
doing in this shithole?

14:08.744 --> 14:09.744
Maestro -

14:10.212 --> 14:12.114
I want to get drunk in a classy joint

14:12.115 --> 14:14.216
with musicians and ice buckets.

14:14.217 --> 14:15.419
- Maestro, I have
something to tell you.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.490
But it must stay
strictly between us two.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.392
What? Speak up, I can't hear you!

14:20.393 --> 14:22.260
I was here when it happened!

14:22.261 --> 14:24.763
I was a waiter in this canteen.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.199
Congratulations. So what?

14:27.200 --> 14:30.069
- So it was nothing like
what Comrade Holban says.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.573
First of all, the gang
made it look like a shoot.

14:32.574 --> 14:36.144
A film shoot, you see?
And no one got hurt.

14:36.145 --> 14:38.380
There were lots of people
and we just stood around here

14:38.381 --> 14:39.781
like idiots enjoying the show

14:39.782 --> 14:41.683
while they loaded the
money into a police van.

14:41.684 --> 14:43.519
The woman fired a machine gun.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.690
I mean, you could have
sworn it was a movie.

14:47.691 --> 14:49.661
What did you say your name was?

14:49.662 --> 14:55.133
Cretin? Clown? You really
haven't got a clue, have you?

14:55.134 --> 14:59.506
What world are you living in?
This is Bucharest, boy. Romania.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.576
We're neighbors of the
great fraternal people.

15:02.577 --> 15:05.213
We don't have hold-ups
like they do in America.

15:05.214 --> 15:06.681
We don't play Dillinger.

15:06.682 --> 15:10.592
Over here, first we arrest the comrades

15:10.621 --> 15:15.671
who make trouble and then
we assign them a crime.

15:18.097 --> 15:20.332
There never was a hold-up.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.803
I have no idea what
you did or didn't see.

15:23.804 --> 15:28.544
But if I were you, I'd
forget I saw anything.

15:30.279 --> 15:32.689
Careful with the lights.

15:32.716 --> 15:35.446
That's good. Faster please.

15:44.231 --> 15:46.732
Maestro, these comrades are extras.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.335
Pedestrians, passersby.

15:48.336 --> 15:50.337
We'll put them wherever you want.

15:50.338 --> 15:53.708
- But they're dressed too
much alike, don't you think?

15:53.709 --> 15:55.939
Nah. Well, never mind.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.048
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

16:04.388 --> 16:06.222
- Get me a strong
coffee and some Aspirin.

16:06.223 --> 16:08.192
- My head is pounding.
- Yes, sir!

16:08.193 --> 16:10.795
- Don't salute when you're
not in uniform, you idiot.

16:10.796 --> 16:15.501
And find me the officer
in charge of security.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.671
- Have you been in a film
before, comrade lieutenant?

16:17.672 --> 16:20.643
- No, comrade captain, this is the
first time. - I see.

16:20.644 --> 16:22.777
The area is completely secured.

16:22.778 --> 16:23.913
All exits are covered.

16:23.914 --> 16:25.414
Listen to me very carefully.

16:25.415 --> 16:27.550
I don't want any unpleasant surprises

16:27.551 --> 16:30.561
or there will be hell to pay.

16:30.755 --> 16:32.305
Here they come.

16:51.380 --> 16:52.380
10, 9, 8

16:55.619 --> 16:56.619
7, 6, 5

16:59.424 --> 17:00.664
4, 3, 2, 1.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.281
Happy New Year 1959!

17:08.635 --> 17:11.538
- Happy New Year, Boris, you part
- timer!

17:11.539 --> 17:13.306
Happy New Year, comrade colonel!

17:13.307 --> 17:15.857
May it bring health and..

17:16.811 --> 17:18.271
Here he comes.

17:18.314 --> 17:19.481
Is he coming this way?

17:19.482 --> 17:21.718
- I think he's heading
for the orchestra.

17:21.719 --> 17:23.586
No, no. Wait. He's turning.

17:23.587 --> 17:24.957
Are you sure?

17:24.989 --> 17:27.791
- Happy New Year and best
wishes, comrade minister.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.793
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

17:29.794 --> 17:31.344
Happy New Year.

17:31.863 --> 17:34.963
Come with me. We need to talk.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.511
Do you really want to do this?

17:43.512 --> 17:44.680
Do what? I don't know what you mean.

17:44.681 --> 17:46.749
Don't play dumb with me. She's here.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.352
Crying on my shoulder, poor child.

17:49.353 --> 17:50.886
Max, we all have our differences.

17:50.887 --> 17:52.755
You know, we argue today,
we make up tomorrow.

17:52.756 --> 17:55.359
Life moves on with the
onward march of communism?

17:55.360 --> 17:57.395
So why don't you two make up and give me

17:57.396 --> 17:58.997
a couple of kids? 'Cause you know what?

17:58.998 --> 18:00.334
I think I could make a perfect uncle.

18:00.335 --> 18:01.868
Ilya, she's unbearable.

18:01.869 --> 18:03.570
Well, as if I didn't know that.

18:03.571 --> 18:04.770
Yes, she's difficult.

18:04.771 --> 18:08.809
Yes, she's impulsive, yes.
Well, she's my sister, dammit!

18:08.810 --> 18:11.079
But she loves you, I know she does.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.317
Look, Max, I'm not saying this
as Minister of the Interior

18:14.318 --> 18:16.219
- ...or even as your
brother-in-law - Can I just say

18:16.220 --> 18:18.923
Forget about this divorce business.

18:18.924 --> 18:21.458
So, please. Yeah, I beg you.

18:21.459 --> 18:23.961
I'd even get down on my knees
but that might be taken the wrong way.

18:23.962 --> 18:26.882
Go to her, ask her to dance.

18:26.934 --> 18:28.868
Make peace, will you?
- Listen, believe me -

18:28.869 --> 18:31.639
Table. Sonia. Dance. Please.

18:41.351 --> 18:42.631
Let's dance.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.004
- Minister's orders?
- Don't start, Sonia, please.

18:58.005 --> 18:59.785
Let's be friends.

19:00.609 --> 19:03.945
- You're such a spineless
weakling. What did he say?

19:03.946 --> 19:05.880
- He said, "Long live
peace between nations."

19:05.881 --> 19:09.885
- Yeah! He nailed you
with two words, didn't he?

19:09.886 --> 19:13.089
And I bet I know which
ones. Job security.

19:13.090 --> 19:16.500
I thought we declared a ceasefire.

19:16.796 --> 19:18.730
Why did you come here?

19:18.731 --> 19:20.421
I want to party.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.802
I want to have fun with my husband.

19:22.803 --> 19:26.973
- Well..
- Max Radoiu, formerly Rosenthal.

19:27.609 --> 19:30.969
Amateur cop, professional Jew-boy.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.149
Tell me, Rosenthal, how many Jew-boys

19:34.150 --> 19:35.684
do you think I've had in my life?

19:35.685 --> 19:36.919
I have no idea.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.623
But I could tell you a thing
or two about Christian girls.

19:39.624 --> 19:40.624
Yeah?

19:47.667 --> 19:50.627
Want to turn the other cheek?

19:53.641 --> 19:55.191
Happy New Year.

19:56.979 --> 19:58.989
I'll be right back.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.121
- Pascu? Costin?
- Yes, sir!

20:05.122 --> 20:07.791
- Take this person to the
nearest police station.

20:07.792 --> 20:11.462
Tell the duty officer I order
him to place her under arrest.

20:11.463 --> 20:13.999
Tell him to put in his report she
attacked a uniformed police officer.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.190
Go now, go.

20:15.702 --> 20:17.702
Alright. Easy, boys.

20:24.112 --> 20:27.072
What are you trying to prove?

20:27.218 --> 20:30.487
One phone call from me, she'll
be out of there in no time.

20:30.488 --> 20:31.488
I know.

20:32.723 --> 20:36.233
But you'll have to make that call.

20:48.076 --> 20:51.256
Happy New Year, comrade colonel!

21:16.812 --> 21:18.452
Dumi! Your turn.

21:19.049 --> 21:20.049
Really?

21:20.283 --> 21:24.287
I don't know. They
- they invented a cure for cancer?

21:24.288 --> 21:26.055
I've got a better one.

21:26.056 --> 21:27.725
They start World War III.

21:27.726 --> 21:29.260
- Wishful thinking.
- No! We don't want war.

21:29.261 --> 21:30.862
We're fighting for peace!

21:30.863 --> 21:32.764
Well, that'll be a long fight.

21:32.765 --> 21:34.833
What about you, my little dove?

21:34.834 --> 21:37.804
What do you think is gonna
change the world in 1959?

21:37.805 --> 21:40.715
Nylon tights come to Romania?

21:42.944 --> 21:45.180
- Here's one. The Americans
withdraw from Europe.

21:45.181 --> 21:47.983
West Germany is annexed by East Germany.

21:47.984 --> 21:49.184
Or vice versa?

21:49.185 --> 21:52.255
- Dream on.
- Marilyn Monroe gets divorced.

21:52.256 --> 21:54.859
- She divorces more often
than she marries. No.

21:54.860 --> 21:58.731
Gentlemen, I'm afraid your
thinking is a little too earthbound.

21:58.732 --> 22:02.068
How about 1959, the first man in space?

22:02.069 --> 22:03.736
Good, good, good.

22:03.737 --> 22:05.771
- Max, my friend,
that's very sweet of you.

22:05.772 --> 22:07.374
But I'm afraid it's gonna
be another 10 years at least

22:07.375 --> 22:09.711
before there's a tovarich in space.

22:09.712 --> 22:10.712
Why?

22:10.713 --> 22:12.347
The Russians already
have a bitch in orbit.

22:12.348 --> 22:15.953
- Of course, Laika, the
four-legged wet-nosed

22:15.954 --> 22:17.220
heroine of the Soviet people.

22:17.221 --> 22:19.122
Sure, now, they sent her there alright.

22:19.123 --> 22:22.393
Problem is, Max, she's still up there.

22:22.394 --> 22:24.995
Problem is we haven't worked out how
to get the damn capsule back to Earth.

22:24.996 --> 22:27.967
- But surely they can find some crackpot
to volunteer his life for science?

22:27.968 --> 22:31.238
Wouldn't you volunteer, if they asked?

22:31.239 --> 22:34.519
Imagine it, the big news of 1959

22:35.743 --> 22:38.714
Dumi Auerbach, the first Jew deported

22:38.715 --> 22:41.855
into outer space, one-way trip.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.320
Wouldn't you go? I would.

22:46.723 --> 22:48.025
Sure you would.

22:48.026 --> 22:49.159
During the war you were getting us all

22:49.160 --> 22:51.763
wound up about changing the world.

22:51.764 --> 22:56.703
- Now that the world has changed for the
worse, you want to go to another planet.

22:56.704 --> 22:58.038
You're a dreamer, Max.

22:58.039 --> 23:00.274
Well, that is part of my charm.

23:00.275 --> 23:02.910
Yes, lollipop, that's your charm.

23:02.911 --> 23:04.712
Thank you, sweetheart.

23:04.713 --> 23:05.853
Some charm.

23:05.948 --> 23:08.283
Look where it led us all, Max's charm!

23:08.284 --> 23:10.186
Okay, the years in the
Resistance were fun.

23:10.187 --> 23:12.088
But what about now?

23:12.089 --> 23:13.891
We're spending New Year's Eve
with whores instead of wives.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.461
- Hey, watch your language. - Because
you taught us freedom fighters

23:16.462 --> 23:18.996
must be free and now you're
the only one who's married.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.766
And because you're married, and
because of who you're married to

23:21.767 --> 23:23.469
you're the only one
who isn't blacklisted.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.171
- You're talking about
Sonia here, right?

23:25.172 --> 23:27.440
Well, I wouldn't envy him if I were you.

23:27.441 --> 23:30.010
- You're right. No wonder he
wants to move to another planet.

23:30.011 --> 23:31.946
That's his revolution.

23:31.947 --> 23:33.916
Let's toast my revolution?

23:33.917 --> 23:35.984
- Your Revolution!
- Revolution.

23:35.985 --> 23:39.065
- The Revolution!
- Revolution!

23:39.090 --> 23:42.393
- Maestro, warm our hearts.
- The Revolution is a whore.

23:42.394 --> 23:45.129
- Everyone agreed?
- Agreed.

23:45.130 --> 23:48.068
Yeah. But the opposite is also true.

23:48.069 --> 23:50.870
Really? Did you understand
what the gentleman said?

23:50.905 --> 23:52.204
He said that you are a revolution.

23:52.205 --> 23:54.307
Not me. My associate maybe.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.076
Are you calling me a revolution?

23:56.077 --> 23:57.537
Hey, hey, hey.

24:00.883 --> 24:01.933
Come here.

24:06.024 --> 24:09.664
You're a little revolution, you are!

24:10.262 --> 24:13.312
And you screwed us, you bitch.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.168
We were madly in love with you

24:16.169 --> 24:19.906
ready to give our lives for
you at a moment's notice.

24:19.907 --> 24:23.678
You turned out to be
nothing but a cheap slut.

24:23.679 --> 24:26.815
Now, you're going to see what
a real uprising looks like.

24:26.816 --> 24:28.226
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

24:48.611 --> 24:51.080
I knew I'd find you here.

24:51.081 --> 24:52.081
Alice?

24:55.819 --> 24:56.988
Is it really you?

24:56.989 --> 25:00.826
- Here's the real event of
1959. Alice has come home!

25:00.827 --> 25:03.962
- Rumor was you were partying like
animals and I wanted to see for myself.

25:03.963 --> 25:06.999
ha! So we're already the talk of Moscow?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.650
I can't believe it's you!

25:14.808 --> 25:20.808
I know some party hacks that might
accuse the lady of bourgeois elegance.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.781
You, vodka! You, "Kalinka!"

25:52.222 --> 25:53.222
Hey!

26:03.871 --> 26:05.306
Hey, everybody!

26:05.307 --> 26:08.127
Fidel Castro's taken Havana!

26:08.243 --> 26:09.793
Batista's fled!

26:10.012 --> 26:12.480
They just announced it on the radio!

26:12.481 --> 26:13.481
Victory!

26:17.253 --> 26:21.663
- Now, there's something
we didn't predict!

26:23.494 --> 26:25.264
- So,
Alice.. - -

26:26.365 --> 26:28.266
What are you going to do?

26:28.267 --> 26:31.037
I wonder if I could become an actress

26:31.038 --> 26:33.006
now that I don't have
to speak Russian anymore.

26:33.007 --> 26:35.809
- Good idea. We should
all take acting classes.

26:35.810 --> 26:37.946
You? Why would you do it?

26:37.947 --> 26:41.217
- My dear Alice, Wonderland
is not what it used to be.

26:41.218 --> 26:43.152
Especially for us Yids.

26:43.153 --> 26:45.957
- Our goyish comrades have
begun a round of spring cleaning

26:45.958 --> 26:47.825
to reinvigorate the Party.

26:47.826 --> 26:50.195
So we should all become actors.

26:50.196 --> 26:53.499
- There are plenty of juicy parts
for us Jews to play these days.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.837
Enemies of the state,
aristocrats, speculators.

26:57.838 --> 26:59.506
Why not, big man?

26:59.507 --> 27:03.737
1959, the year we all
become movie stars!

27:07.851 --> 27:13.457
- Alright, you fucking scumbags,
we're gonna put you in a film.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.193
You're going to give us
a step-by-step rendering

27:16.194 --> 27:18.963
of your criminal actions
as gangsters and traitors

27:18.964 --> 27:21.401
and after the firing
squad is through with you

27:21.402 --> 27:23.903
we're gonna show the
film across the country.

27:23.904 --> 27:29.411
So that everyone can spit in
your stinking reactionary faces.

27:29.412 --> 27:31.546
These are no ordinary thieves.

27:31.547 --> 27:35.051
You'll be surprised to hear
they were all Party members.

27:35.052 --> 27:36.451
And not recent ones either.

27:36.452 --> 27:38.154
They all joined before the war.

27:38.155 --> 27:40.291
They were active resistance fighters

27:40.292 --> 27:42.927
that took part in sabotage
missions against the Nazis.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.158
They were heroes then.

27:46.165 --> 27:51.204
After the war they all held
important positions, except the woman

27:51.205 --> 27:53.272
who went to study in the Soviet Union

27:53.273 --> 27:56.510
and came back with a
degree in political science.

27:56.511 --> 28:01.191
Until the robbery, the
gang leader, Max Radoiu

28:01.318 --> 28:03.619
was head of criminal investigation

28:03.620 --> 28:06.356
for the Bucharest Police Department.

28:06.357 --> 28:09.393
- Tell me, Rosenthal, how did
a vicious enemy of the people

28:09.394 --> 28:12.463
like you get into the police department?

28:12.464 --> 28:14.000
I bribed a doorman.

28:14.001 --> 28:15.821
What a degenerate!

28:16.336 --> 28:20.607
- Dumitru Dorneanu was a scientist,
an expert in atomic physics

28:20.608 --> 28:24.479
the Romanian representative to the
USSR for the Soviet Space program.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.349
Name and first name.

28:26.350 --> 28:28.517
Prisoner Dorneanu, Dumitru.

28:28.518 --> 28:31.338
Dorneanu, or is it Auerbach?

28:32.122 --> 28:36.360
Tell me, Auerbach, why do you
people always take Romanian names?

28:36.361 --> 28:38.229
Do you really think you can fool us?

28:38.230 --> 28:44.230
When it's written on your
face, like a sign on a bus. Yid!

28:45.006 --> 28:49.589
Razvan Orodel, born Orvitz, used to
be an important columnist until his

28:49.590 --> 28:53.982
right to a byline was withdrawn,
and he was demoted to a proof-reader.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.893
Pull your trousers down. Now.

29:03.563 --> 29:07.533
- Well then, Orvitz, the sign's
not only on your face, is it?

29:07.534 --> 29:11.171
- Yorgu Ristea, university
history professor.

29:11.172 --> 29:13.472
Before the robbery, he had
lost his university chair

29:13.473 --> 29:15.675
and was teaching in a secondary school.

29:15.676 --> 29:18.681
Feldiman. I like you, Feldiman,

29:18.682 --> 29:20.282
and here's the proof.

29:20.283 --> 29:21.316
Look how well you done here.

29:21.317 --> 29:22.952
You've fattened right up.

29:22.953 --> 29:26.489
Your belly's as big as my
wife's when she's pregnant!

29:26.490 --> 29:28.125
Who's the happy father?

29:28.126 --> 29:29.126
Tsk tsk.

29:38.271 --> 29:40.040
They're all Jews.

29:40.041 --> 29:44.311
Our film should highlight
this aspect with great finesse.

29:44.312 --> 29:46.862
We are not anti-Semitic..

29:47.651 --> 29:50.586
...but we cannot be indifferent
to the threat of Zionism either.

29:50.587 --> 29:53.457
We will have to use innuendo

29:53.724 --> 29:57.361
and I'll be counting on Maestro
Flaviu's experience for this.

29:57.362 --> 30:02.502
- Yes, yes. Yes, of course, we
- we must be subtle.

30:02.503 --> 30:05.270
- I want them to look
so smug and glamorous

30:05.271 --> 30:10.312
that the man on the street will
consider them a personal insult.

30:10.313 --> 30:13.383
Madam, will you allow me this dance?

30:13.384 --> 30:16.753
Now that you're gonna be
in a film, you'll be famous.

30:16.754 --> 30:22.264
I want to tell my friends
I danced with a movie star.

30:22.495 --> 30:25.497
I'm afraid I'd stomp on your toes.

30:25.498 --> 30:27.908
What's that, sweetheart?

30:29.169 --> 30:32.571
Well, let's see if you have any talent.

30:32.572 --> 30:35.622
Do you know any poetry?
- No.

30:36.278 --> 30:38.580
Now, don't tell me you
don't know a single poem.

30:38.581 --> 30:42.991
Everybody knows at
least one poem by heart.

30:43.253 --> 30:46.657
Right, let's see what poems you know.

30:46.658 --> 30:50.193
I mean, you're all great
fucking artists, aren't ya?

30:50.194 --> 30:56.194
So get reciting or I'll cut off
your kosher pickled dicks one by one.

30:57.537 --> 31:00.841
All you fucking outlaws,
have I made myself clear?

31:00.842 --> 31:03.672
I want to hear a poem! Now!

31:04.146 --> 31:09.686
- 5,000 pages in those files and
still one question left unanswered.

31:09.687 --> 31:10.687
Why?

31:11.255 --> 31:12.321
Why did they do it?

31:12.322 --> 31:15.827
As the poet says, "What
drove them into battle?"

31:15.828 --> 31:19.163
- The Party has driven
us all into battle.

31:19.164 --> 31:23.602
Workers and peasants united at
last, class-struggle sharpens.

31:23.603 --> 31:29.603
We're no longer cattle, we're
communists saying farewell to the past!

31:30.747 --> 31:33.207
Lights out in 2 minutes.

31:36.653 --> 31:38.343
I say we refuse.

31:38.722 --> 31:41.658
What can they do? Execute us twice?

31:41.659 --> 31:43.894
At least we won't get humiliated.

31:43.895 --> 31:45.829
Are you thinking about escaping?

31:45.830 --> 31:46.830
No.

31:47.367 --> 31:48.733
If they do decide to take us outside

31:48.734 --> 31:51.138
the security will be twice
as tight as it is in here.

31:51.139 --> 31:52.304
Let's refuse then.

31:52.305 --> 31:55.143
What do we gain by refusing?

31:55.144 --> 31:56.643
I already told you. We
don't get humiliated.

31:56.644 --> 31:58.779
You're obsessed with humiliation.

31:58.780 --> 32:00.716
Too bad you don't have
a mirror right now.

32:00.717 --> 32:02.885
You'd be amazed at
how dignified you look.

32:02.886 --> 32:05.355
- At least I opened
my mouth. You didn't.

32:05.356 --> 32:06.890
Hey! What is this?

32:06.891 --> 32:10.794
Dignity, humiliation,
escapes, violin strings.

32:10.795 --> 32:13.745
Sunshine, comrades. Fresh air.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.904
Green grass, girls in summer dresses.

32:17.905 --> 32:19.639
That's what we're talking about.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.740
Sasha, tell the others the four of us

32:20.741 --> 32:23.710
are taking a few trips
outside, beginning tomorrow.

32:23.711 --> 32:29.711
If they want to send any
messages, they better get writing.

32:30.587 --> 32:32.727
Hey, got any letters?

32:33.391 --> 32:34.941
Write them now.

33:58.764 --> 34:01.867
So, gentlemen, are we
ready for our closeups?

34:01.868 --> 34:03.136
Can I have a lemonade?

34:03.137 --> 34:05.672
- Would you give the lady
your lemonade, please?

34:05.673 --> 34:06.673
Thank you.

34:06.674 --> 34:08.007
- Theo, can you go
check on the film stock?

34:08.009 --> 34:11.012
George! How are you, old chap?

34:11.013 --> 34:14.949
Marcu! Cristescu! What's going on, boys?

34:14.949 --> 34:16.018
They're putting you out of pasture?

34:16.018 --> 34:17.652
Let's see. What have we got?

34:17.652 --> 34:18.652
Nationale.

34:19.588 --> 34:20.588
Not bad!

34:21.059 --> 34:22.059
Stolen.

34:52.732 --> 34:54.466
- What are you doing?
Are you filming me?

34:54.467 --> 34:56.067
No, I was just preparing.
I was just lining up my

34:56.068 --> 34:57.970
- Don't film me without
my knowing it, okay?

34:57.971 --> 35:02.709
- Of course not. No, I..
- Of course not. Never.

35:02.710 --> 35:04.379
Well, can I take a look?

35:04.380 --> 35:06.430
Yeah, no, of course.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.863
Put your eye in there.

35:08.951 --> 35:11.120
- I don't see anything.
- Um..

35:11.121 --> 35:14.131
There's Yorgu! He's so funny!

35:15.727 --> 35:17.129
This film will be a comedy.

35:17.130 --> 35:18.864
Can I ask you a question?

35:18.865 --> 35:22.134
- Am I free tonight? No, I
don't think I'm free tonight.

35:22.135 --> 35:25.505
Did you really rob that bank car?

35:25.506 --> 35:27.940
You can't believe it, can you?

35:27.941 --> 35:29.401
Neither can I.

35:29.545 --> 35:32.045
- Prisoners are not to
touch the camera! Understood?

35:32.046 --> 35:36.718
- If - if - if that's the way you start
treating people, pushing them around

35:36.719 --> 35:40.022
well, I'm sorry, I simply cannot
work under these conditions!

35:40.023 --> 35:45.069
I want to go back to my cell!
Maybe my colleagues can accept

35:45.070 --> 35:49.701
this kind of treatment, but
as a woman I cannot allow it.

35:49.702 --> 35:52.522
Miss Bercovich, it's my

35:52.540 --> 35:54.040
What's all the fuss about?

35:54.041 --> 35:57.231
I'm not used to such impudence!

35:57.712 --> 35:58.946
In my milieu -

35:58.947 --> 36:00.515
- What's going on?
Has she lost her mind?

36:00.516 --> 36:04.787
- I caught her touching the camera!
- No excuses. No excuses. Such behavior.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.524
So uncouth, so rude, inexcusable!

36:07.525 --> 36:09.985
What? Who upset my star?

36:11.095 --> 36:15.467
Come, come my angel, you mustn't
cry, you'll ruin your makeup.

36:15.468 --> 36:18.938
A great actress must
be strong on the set.

36:18.939 --> 36:23.211
Now calm down and give
us a nice little smile.

36:23.212 --> 36:24.812
That's my girl.

36:26.815 --> 36:27.815
She needs to do her makeup.

36:27.816 --> 36:29.750
- Okay, that's enough.
Take her back to makeup.

36:29.751 --> 36:33.223
I want to start shooting this
damn movie before nightfall.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.959
Keep your men under control, captain.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.230
Since when have they been
allowed to show initiative?

36:39.231 --> 36:41.198
Are you alright now?

36:41.199 --> 36:46.273
- Don't be silly. I was
just marking my territory.

36:46.274 --> 36:47.274
Stand by.

36:48.977 --> 36:49.977
All set.

36:50.212 --> 36:54.122
Mister Flaviu, sir, we can start now.

36:54.683 --> 36:55.683
What?

36:56.051 --> 37:00.089
- What are we shooting?
- The part where they steal the taxi.

37:00.090 --> 37:01.090
Precisely.

37:05.864 --> 37:06.964
Well, what's happening?

37:06.965 --> 37:09.235
Mister Flaviu. Maestro?

37:12.006 --> 37:13.272
They shouldn't have given him the vodka.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.913
Vodka? Who gave him vodka?

37:16.110 --> 37:19.981
- Well, it seems the
maestro is a little tired.

37:19.982 --> 37:22.285
Fortunately the actors
all know their roles.

37:22.286 --> 37:24.066
What's your name?

37:24.254 --> 37:26.204
- Virgil.
- Virgil.

37:26.624 --> 37:28.025
What do you think?

37:28.026 --> 37:30.762
Should we let him sleep, get to work?

37:30.763 --> 37:31.862
Here's what we're gonna do.

37:31.863 --> 37:34.199
You're gonna film the taxi.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.468
It's going to come down the street.

37:35.469 --> 37:39.940
It's gonna get closer, closer,
and stop just where it is now.

37:39.941 --> 37:41.909
Do you think you can do that?

37:41.910 --> 37:43.190
Get to work.

37:44.745 --> 37:46.280
Scene 4 Take 1.

37:46.281 --> 37:49.421
Here we go. Rolling and action!

37:58.698 --> 38:00.338
Stop, stop. Cut!

38:00.600 --> 38:02.201
Why are you smiling?

38:02.202 --> 38:04.070
You've got a gun to your
head and you're smiling?

38:04.071 --> 38:06.038
I want to see you shitting your pants.

38:06.039 --> 38:08.175
Like you've been told to
report to your superior!

38:08.176 --> 38:10.777
Get in the car, let's do it again.

38:10.778 --> 38:12.378
Scene 4 Take 2.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.172
Go! Go! Go!

38:16.152 --> 38:18.220
No, wait, wait. Stop! Stop!

38:18.221 --> 38:19.622
What are you morons doing?

38:19.623 --> 38:22.359
Look at the shop
window, not at the taxi!

38:22.360 --> 38:25.229
Marcu, if I catch you
looking at that taxi once more

38:25.230 --> 38:26.964
I'm gonna shove a roll
of film down your throat.

38:26.965 --> 38:27.965
Hear me?

38:28.133 --> 38:31.104
I've never seen such a bunch
of idiots in all my life!

38:31.105 --> 38:33.106
He seems to know what he's doing.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.847
Let's pray to God he does.

38:38.412 --> 38:40.322
Just an expression.

38:43.052 --> 38:45.253
I'm gonna give you something.

38:45.254 --> 38:47.723
I want you to put them in your
pocket, keep your mouth shut.

38:47.724 --> 38:48.991
- Sorry?
- They are addresses.

38:48.992 --> 38:50.228
Try to find the families, let them know

38:50.229 --> 38:53.731
their loved ones are alive,
but locked up in Jilava Prison.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.732
Got it?

38:57.037 --> 38:59.807
Everyone ready? Roll camera.

39:00.407 --> 39:02.007
Scene 4 Take 2.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.885
- Now if I see so much
as a hint of a smile,

39:09.886 --> 39:15.036
I'll smack you so hard
you'll never get up again.

39:45.063 --> 39:46.433
That was fun.

40:09.292 --> 40:11.428
- Hello? I'm sorry to
disturb you so late, ma'am.

40:11.429 --> 40:13.381
But I have some very
important news for you.

40:13.416 --> 40:15.333
A close relative of
yours wants you to know

40:15.334 --> 40:18.171
that he is still alive and in
good health, in Jilava Prison.

40:18.172 --> 40:19.739
Yeah, he sends you his love.

40:19.740 --> 40:20.740
Goodnight.

40:25.949 --> 40:28.182
You're allowed one call a day.

40:28.183 --> 40:30.853
If you make two, there
will be none tomorrow.

40:30.854 --> 40:32.084
Your choice.

40:38.196 --> 40:41.601
That said, if your intentions
are noble and we can annoy

40:41.602 --> 40:45.237
the Bolshies a bit, there
might be room for negotiation.

40:45.238 --> 40:49.110
May I ask to whom you
were speaking just now?

40:49.111 --> 40:51.078
- My fiance.
- Fine.

40:51.079 --> 40:54.949
You must ask her over for dinner one
evening so we can get to know her.

40:54.950 --> 40:58.754
- Alright. - Lovely conversation you
were having too.

40:58.755 --> 41:01.759
"Jilava Prison, important news.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.661
Somebody is still alive!"

41:03.662 --> 41:05.363
You call her madam.

41:05.364 --> 41:08.464
You two must be madly in love.

41:09.369 --> 41:11.703
If Sarah finds out I'm drinking

41:11.704 --> 41:14.273
and smoking, I'm done for.

41:14.274 --> 41:15.274
L'chaim.

41:16.143 --> 41:19.783
Now stop lying and tell me straight.

41:20.850 --> 41:23.186
- It's complicated. It
- it..

41:23.187 --> 41:24.854
Over at the studio, we're
- we're

41:24.855 --> 41:26.256
we're shooting an educational film.

41:26.257 --> 41:29.793
Sort
- sort of a reconstruction of 5 people

41:29.794 --> 41:33.163
who robbed a bank car and
got away with the money.

41:33.164 --> 41:35.434
- The
- the Rosenthal gang!

41:35.435 --> 41:37.069
I know all about it.

41:37.070 --> 41:39.405
The Martyrs' Square heist, last year.

41:39.406 --> 41:41.875
- How did you know? That
- that's a classified secret.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.016
Big secret.

41:44.712 --> 41:45.712
Shh.

41:46.782 --> 41:49.284
The "Voice of America"
and "Radio Free Europe"

41:49.285 --> 41:51.754
have been talking about it for months.

41:51.755 --> 41:53.121
They can't have.

41:53.122 --> 41:55.762
Yes, they can. Believe me.

41:56.695 --> 41:57.961
Mr. Zilber, some people are saying

41:57.962 --> 41:59.230
that there never was a hold-up.

41:59.231 --> 42:00.465
That it was all made up.

42:00.466 --> 42:03.169
That it was a political trick
to get rid of some bad eggs.

42:03.170 --> 42:07.772
- Oi, the stuff they fill
your heads with these days.

42:07.773 --> 42:09.310
Now, just listen to me.

42:09.311 --> 42:11.713
There was an armed robbery.

42:11.714 --> 42:14.249
They were going to use the money to pay

42:14.250 --> 42:16.985
for 10,000 Jews to leave for Israel.

42:16.986 --> 42:19.723
It's what's called a Zionist Operation.

42:19.724 --> 42:23.292
And it's a shame that
they never pulled it off.

42:23.293 --> 42:25.496
- This is "Voice
of America." - -hah.

42:25.497 --> 42:31.497
- And now we broadcast "Symphony
Number 3" in F major by Johannes Brahms.

42:36.377 --> 42:38.557
- Mr. Zilber?
- What?

42:38.948 --> 42:40.916
- If you like listening
to classical music so much

42:40.917 --> 42:42.952
why do you listen to
it on "Voice of America"

42:42.953 --> 42:45.256
with all the static and the noise?

42:45.257 --> 42:47.425
Why don't you listen to
it on an official station?

42:47.426 --> 42:50.828
On an official station, my dear boy..

42:50.829 --> 42:54.139
...even Brahms becomes propaganda.

43:04.213 --> 43:05.263
Thank you.

43:06.882 --> 43:07.932
Un moment.

43:33.550 --> 43:37.730
- Nobody touches the
food until we shoot!

43:38.522 --> 43:39.802
What's this?

43:40.423 --> 43:41.958
Is this a joke?

43:41.959 --> 43:44.195
Is this your vision
of bourgeois opulence?

43:44.196 --> 43:46.898
You think we spent the
people's money eating this crap?

43:46.899 --> 43:48.365
Don't make me laugh.

43:48.366 --> 43:53.676
Boys, make mine a chateaubriand
with sautéd potatoes.

43:54.909 --> 43:57.077
And I'll have Canard a l'orange.

43:57.078 --> 43:59.146
Grilled swordfish fillet.

43:59.147 --> 44:01.449
Zingara with vegetables.

44:01.450 --> 44:03.585
A little, caviar on toast perhaps.

44:03.586 --> 44:06.406
And two bottles of Burgundy.

44:10.394 --> 44:11.624
Roll camera.

44:12.531 --> 44:14.221
Scene 2, take 1.

44:17.304 --> 44:18.304
Action!

44:26.081 --> 44:28.721
Laugh, talk to each other.

44:34.591 --> 44:35.821
Lunch break!

44:37.060 --> 44:40.160
I won't ask you any questions.

44:42.001 --> 44:43.469
Hey! Come downstairs.

44:43.470 --> 44:45.750
Let's make some calls.

44:53.649 --> 44:57.509
Bercovich Alice, you're under arrest.

44:59.923 --> 45:00.923
Come on.

45:04.496 --> 45:05.496
Hey. Hey.

45:06.299 --> 45:07.349
You idiot!

45:08.600 --> 45:09.602
You've just ruined the scene.

45:09.603 --> 45:12.370
- But she struggled.
- What? It was perfect.

45:12.371 --> 45:13.439
Very realistic. I thought.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.676
- Communist police
officers do not use violence

45:15.677 --> 45:17.577
the way capitalist policemen do.

45:17.578 --> 45:19.898
What will people think?

45:20.250 --> 45:21.382
Stop resisting?

45:21.383 --> 45:22.753
Just give in.

45:25.422 --> 45:27.112
Scene 3, take 2.

45:32.698 --> 45:35.433
Bercovich Alice, you're under arrest.

45:35.434 --> 45:37.569
Really? What a surprise?

45:37.570 --> 45:39.138
Just a moment, I'll go get dressed

45:39.139 --> 45:44.459
and then I'll follow you
comrades wherever you want.

45:46.448 --> 45:49.416
- Come on, people,
this is no time for fun!

45:49.417 --> 45:52.107
Let's get this thing over!

45:58.063 --> 45:59.063
Yes?

46:04.005 --> 46:07.039
- There's an officer
from the Securitate here.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.875
He wants to talk to you.

46:08.876 --> 46:11.286
He's waiting downstairs.

46:18.021 --> 46:20.122
Should he take warmer clothing?

46:20.123 --> 46:22.259
A sweater, woolen socks?

46:22.260 --> 46:24.027
- No need.
- Did you hear that?

46:24.028 --> 46:26.758
"No need." That's positive.

46:44.521 --> 46:46.890
Can I ask where we're going?

46:46.891 --> 46:48.491
To pay a visit.

46:58.404 --> 47:01.908
At last! I thought you'd got lost.

47:01.909 --> 47:05.480
Take your jacket off,
Virgil. It's hot in here.

47:05.481 --> 47:07.482
Do you like the house?

47:07.483 --> 47:09.517
I got it 6 months ago.

47:09.518 --> 47:13.323
Most of the furniture comes from
the former tenant, Max Rosenthal

47:13.324 --> 47:16.864
currently residing in Jilava Prison.

47:16.896 --> 47:18.946
Come into the study.

47:19.163 --> 47:20.163
Coffee?

47:20.968 --> 47:22.698
Please, sit down.

47:23.103 --> 47:26.105
I've been drinking the stuff all
day, I can't take another drop.

47:26.106 --> 47:27.566
I'm exhausted.

47:27.643 --> 47:29.510
Ever since my wife left

47:29.511 --> 47:31.479
that's Sylvia, my wife..

47:31.480 --> 47:33.381
...I haven't been able to sleep.

47:33.382 --> 47:37.562
No idea why, must be,
um...psychological.

47:37.654 --> 47:38.654
Cigarette?

47:40.957 --> 47:43.917
We found these under his bed.

47:45.297 --> 47:47.532
Comrade Holban, I admit,
I'm-I'm so passionate

47:47.533 --> 47:48.633
about my work at the studio.

47:48.634 --> 47:50.168
I- I forgot
- - Shh.

47:50.169 --> 47:51.169
Sit.

47:54.141 --> 47:58.011
Don't be afraid. It's nothing serious.

47:58.046 --> 48:00.516
On the contrary, I want you to continue

48:00.517 --> 48:03.477
to do little favors for them.

48:03.486 --> 48:05.576
Win their confidence.

48:09.728 --> 48:11.662
I want you to help me understand.

48:11.663 --> 48:15.166
- That depends...on what
it is you find confusing.

48:15.167 --> 48:18.570
- What made these people
turn into gangsters overnight?

48:18.571 --> 48:21.307
What did they intend
to do with the money?

48:21.308 --> 48:23.898
- Some say
that - - What?

48:24.513 --> 48:26.680
That it was a Zionist conspiracy.

48:26.681 --> 48:28.451
To send Jews to Israel.

48:28.452 --> 48:31.087
- Nonsense. Israel buys
Jews with American dollars

48:31.088 --> 48:32.818
not Romanian Lei.

48:32.990 --> 48:36.393
Those files are full of possible
motives we've investigated

48:36.394 --> 48:40.065
each one more ridiculous than the next.

48:40.066 --> 48:43.268
They wanted to finance
Zionist Jewish families

48:43.269 --> 48:45.604
while they waited for their passports.

48:45.605 --> 48:47.740
They wanted to leave
the country themselves..

48:47.741 --> 48:49.677
...on a military plane.

48:49.678 --> 48:53.347
They were trying to fund
anti-communist commandos

48:53.348 --> 48:55.078
in the mountains.

48:55.618 --> 48:56.618
It's all rubbish.

48:56.619 --> 49:00.224
A bunch of nutcases plan
a huge stunt like this

49:00.225 --> 49:02.093
for a few stacks of Lei?

49:02.094 --> 49:05.496
Not US dollars, not Pounds
Sterling, not Swiss Francs.

49:05.497 --> 49:06.497
But Lei?

49:11.571 --> 49:12.851
What's this?

49:13.241 --> 49:15.710
- A 100 Lei note
- Very good.

49:15.711 --> 49:17.512
With this piece of
paper, you can just about

49:17.513 --> 49:19.579
fill your refrigerator.

49:19.580 --> 49:22.117
Buy a good meal in a
restaurant, take a taxi somewhere

49:22.118 --> 49:23.451
or pay your rent.

49:23.452 --> 49:27.512
Now, tell me what you can't do with it?

49:28.192 --> 49:29.558
You can't buy a house.

49:29.559 --> 49:31.262
You can't invest it in the stock market.

49:31.263 --> 49:34.299
You can't buy a gun,
or leave the country.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.668
5 highly intelligent people

49:36.669 --> 49:39.138
throw themselves in
front of the firing squad.

49:39.139 --> 49:40.599
Why? What for?

49:41.409 --> 49:43.229
Blue toilet paper?

49:48.085 --> 49:49.117
What are you doing?

49:49.118 --> 49:51.308
It's just an advance.

49:52.088 --> 49:54.728
We're gonna work together.

49:59.532 --> 50:01.599
I want to find the sixth.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.420
- S
- sixth what?

50:03.803 --> 50:05.838
The sixth member of the gang.

50:05.839 --> 50:07.108
But, there were only 5 of them.

50:07.109 --> 50:09.210
There were 6 of them.

50:09.211 --> 50:12.179
5 actually took part in the robbery.

50:12.180 --> 50:15.450
The sixth was pretending to film it.

50:15.451 --> 50:18.453
Nobody much bothered
about it, Case closed.

50:18.454 --> 50:22.258
But after a year of
investigation, I have a lead.

50:22.259 --> 50:25.362
A small detail all
the others overlooked.

50:25.363 --> 50:28.003
Alice Bercovich has a son.

50:30.803 --> 50:33.740
12 years old, raised
in the Soviet Union.

50:33.741 --> 50:37.812
He disappeared shortly
before his mother's arrest.

50:37.813 --> 50:40.780
It's vital that we find young Bercovich.

50:40.781 --> 50:43.371
And that, Comrade Virgil..

50:43.919 --> 50:45.754
...is where you come in.

50:45.755 --> 50:48.358
We're getting close to
the end of the filming.

50:48.359 --> 50:49.893
Our friends know what that means.

50:49.894 --> 50:52.697
Their sentence will soon be carried out.

50:52.698 --> 50:55.666
I have a hunch that the
woman will try to get in touch

50:55.667 --> 50:58.271
with her son one last time.

50:58.272 --> 50:59.939
You've gained their confidence.

50:59.940 --> 51:02.275
That makes you the ideal messenger.

51:02.276 --> 51:03.677
They'll give you an address

51:03.678 --> 51:05.546
or a phone number.

51:05.547 --> 51:10.647
And that's how you'll
lead us to young Bercovich.

51:18.596 --> 51:20.631
- I suggest we take
a break. It's too hot.

51:20.632 --> 51:22.867
- What about panning on
the taxi from the outside?

51:22.868 --> 51:24.404
What's the rush?

51:24.405 --> 51:25.870
We've got days of filming ahead.

51:25.871 --> 51:27.651
Look at them all.

51:27.775 --> 51:29.542
See? Why overdo it?

51:29.543 --> 51:30.683
Break time!

51:31.612 --> 51:32.612
Break?

51:33.816 --> 51:34.956
What break?

51:35.952 --> 51:38.272
Why's everybody asleep?

51:39.722 --> 51:41.357
I asked a question.

51:41.358 --> 51:43.427
Why is everybody asleep?

51:43.428 --> 51:45.329
Maestro, we've just shot a scene.

51:45.330 --> 51:46.731
Like hell you have!

51:46.732 --> 51:49.868
I've been watching for hours
and you've done fuck all!

51:49.869 --> 51:52.838
Why does nobody follow my orders?

51:52.839 --> 51:54.473
Why am I talking to a brick wall?

51:54.474 --> 51:56.442
Who's in charge here?

51:56.443 --> 51:58.311
Tell me who's in charge?

51:58.312 --> 52:00.514
- You're in charge.
- I'm in charge?

52:00.515 --> 52:01.565
Well, yes.

52:02.285 --> 52:03.585
Like hell I'm in charge.

52:03.586 --> 52:07.323
I'm a prize idiot, that's what I am!

52:07.324 --> 52:10.928
All my life I've had
to deal with idiots!

52:10.929 --> 52:15.619
60 years of hell, 40
years of work, 37 films!

52:16.469 --> 52:19.704
And this is the kind of
crap they make me direct!

52:19.705 --> 52:22.985
Me! The winner of the Jury Prize

52:23.478 --> 52:25.779
at the Kursk Film Festival.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.150
Life is crap!

52:27.282 --> 52:28.282
Ha-ha!

52:34.325 --> 52:36.893
Somebody call an ambulance.

52:36.894 --> 52:38.764
Give him some air.

52:39.464 --> 52:41.666
- No more vod
- No more vodka.

52:41.667 --> 52:42.734
He's choking.

52:42.735 --> 52:46.695
See if there's anything in his mouth.

53:56.595 --> 53:59.564
- Right. Let's get some more
shooting done before night falls.

53:59.565 --> 54:01.065
Comrade Holban.

54:06.572 --> 54:07.608
I think we should call it a day.

54:07.609 --> 54:08.609
Why?

54:08.809 --> 54:09.944
Well, I mean, we've got no director

54:09.945 --> 54:12.913
- So what? With him or
without him, it's all the same.

54:12.914 --> 54:15.083
It seems the cameraman has gone too.

54:15.084 --> 54:17.452
- The boy? Virgil? What
do you mean, "gone?"

54:17.453 --> 54:19.889
Hey! Where's the cameraman?

54:19.890 --> 54:21.122
There's another problem.

54:21.123 --> 54:24.353
One of the prisoners is missing.

54:24.630 --> 54:25.630
What?

54:26.165 --> 54:27.697
No one's missing. They're all here.

54:27.698 --> 54:28.698
Bercovich.

54:41.484 --> 54:43.124
Sound the alarm.

54:46.622 --> 54:47.622
Alarm!

54:48.926 --> 54:51.228
Everybody back in the bus!

54:51.229 --> 54:52.229
Quickly!

54:53.566 --> 54:57.570
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Quickly. Move, move!

54:57.571 --> 54:59.071
- They're going to find
you one way or the other.

54:59.072 --> 55:00.339
It's going to end up badly.

55:00.340 --> 55:03.077
- Yeah, and you know what I'm
risking for trying to escape?

55:03.078 --> 55:04.211
- Yes - no,
sure but -

55:04.212 --> 55:06.514
- I'd love if they sentenced
me to a few extra years

55:06.515 --> 55:08.950
but I doubt it'll happen.

55:08.951 --> 55:12.956
I have to see someone.
Will you wait for me?

55:12.957 --> 55:14.157
They can't accuse you of anything.

55:14.158 --> 55:15.692
I'm armed and I've taken you hostage.

55:15.693 --> 55:18.433
But if you want to go, go.

55:21.032 --> 55:22.722
Back in the bus!

55:24.904 --> 55:25.904
Hey!

55:28.741 --> 55:29.741
Leave it!

55:29.877 --> 55:31.978
Look for the cameraman.

55:31.979 --> 55:36.389
Our only chance is
that they left together.

55:47.999 --> 55:49.902
- What
- what happened?

55:49.903 --> 55:53.363
- I'm fine.
- Why are you crying?

55:53.640 --> 55:58.410
- Because I'm weak.
Weaklings cry over nothing.

56:19.807 --> 56:22.575
What shall we do now?
Can we go to your place?

56:22.576 --> 56:23.576
My place?

56:23.577 --> 56:24.910
- But..
- Is it far?

56:24.911 --> 56:26.881
- Well, yeah, actually.
- Good.

56:26.882 --> 56:29.482
The walk will do me good.

56:30.186 --> 56:32.054
- I have to warn you. I
live with a Jewish couple.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.956
They're pretty old and quite religious.

56:33.957 --> 56:35.691
That's good news.

56:35.692 --> 56:38.195
- They might insist that we
have Sabbath dinner with them.

56:38.196 --> 56:40.799
- I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

56:40.800 --> 56:45.210
Eating is not my worst
nightmare right now.

56:53.616 --> 56:56.683
- And, when have you
planned the wedding for?

56:56.684 --> 56:59.021
- Um, well, we're
not in any real hurry.

56:59.022 --> 57:00.662
Maybe next year.

57:00.789 --> 57:02.825
If you're engaged already

57:02.826 --> 57:04.693
why not get it over and done with?

57:04.694 --> 57:07.231
- Stop nagging them and
let them eat in peace.

57:07.232 --> 57:09.652
It's great to be young.

57:09.802 --> 57:11.703
To have your whole life ahead of you.

57:11.704 --> 57:14.974
Yep, now is when the real fun starts.

57:14.975 --> 57:16.342
Marriage, children.

57:16.343 --> 57:18.433
Work, money troubles.

57:19.014 --> 57:21.116
- Can I pour you some more wine?
- That's enough.

57:21.117 --> 57:22.416
He mustn't drink any alcohol.

57:22.417 --> 57:23.652
Serve your fiancé.

57:23.653 --> 57:27.089
- Tell me, miss, how come
you're wearing that uniform?

57:27.090 --> 57:28.959
It's the, Patriot Guard uniform.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.727
Alice is rehearsing for
the Liberation Day parade.

57:31.728 --> 57:33.638
The Liberation Day?

57:35.100 --> 57:38.871
And are you thinking of
becoming a party member as well?

57:38.872 --> 57:41.073
I've already been a party member.

57:41.074 --> 57:42.484
Amazing! When?

57:43.678 --> 57:46.048
From 1945 to last year.

57:46.181 --> 57:47.849
- Would you like to listen
to some music on the radio?

57:47.850 --> 57:48.990
Since 1945?

57:49.986 --> 57:51.787
But at the end of the war the party

57:51.788 --> 57:53.155
had less than 1000 members!

57:53.156 --> 57:55.758
And 3 quarters of them were Jews.

57:55.759 --> 57:58.796
That's why they say the Jews
brought the Bolsheviks to power.

57:58.797 --> 58:01.117
Are you Jewish?
- Yes.

58:01.166 --> 58:04.737
- And the Bolsheviks
kicked you out of the party!

58:04.738 --> 58:06.807
- It's a bit more
complicated than that.

58:06.808 --> 58:08.909
I wouldn't expect it to be simple.

58:08.910 --> 58:13.190
And did they cut your
hair like that too?

58:17.353 --> 58:22.033
When the Rosenthal gang
attacked that bank car

58:22.125 --> 58:25.296
the Voice of America
said they were all wearing

58:25.297 --> 58:27.567
Patriot Guard uniforms.

58:28.333 --> 58:32.105
And that car parked
outside, a Soviet-built Zis

58:32.106 --> 58:37.836
if I'm not mistaken, copied
from the 1939 Packard model.

58:38.179 --> 58:42.499
Does that belong to
the Patriot Guard too?

58:46.890 --> 58:49.125
Don't worry, I know how it works.

58:49.126 --> 58:50.993
They won't do anything
before tomorrow morning.

58:50.994 --> 58:53.314
It's only surveillance.

58:54.233 --> 58:55.800
And tomorrow morning?

58:55.801 --> 58:58.661
Tomorrow morning I surrender.

58:58.972 --> 59:00.139
We're shooting the hold-up.

59:00.140 --> 59:04.150
It's my big scene, for crying out loud.

59:04.178 --> 59:05.178
Ha!

59:06.480 --> 59:08.283
We used some of these that day.

59:08.284 --> 59:10.294
It is one of those.

59:12.155 --> 59:13.705
You were there?

59:14.557 --> 59:18.161
- I was a waiter in the
canteen on the square.

59:18.162 --> 59:20.531
We all thought it was a real film shoot.

59:20.532 --> 59:26.532
It was so exciting, I decided
to change my job there and then..

59:31.579 --> 59:32.979
I'll-I'll leave you to go and sleep.

59:32.980 --> 59:35.081
I'll be downstairs if you need anything.

59:35.082 --> 59:36.632
Come over here.

59:38.153 --> 59:39.653
Come.
- Where?

59:40.859 --> 59:43.159
- I know we're skipping
the bits where we hold hands

59:43.160 --> 59:47.431
walk in the park and
recite poems to each other.

59:47.432 --> 59:51.352
But this is the last chance I'll have.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:07.056
No, no no. Please, please,
you-you'll regret it.

01:00:07.057 --> 01:00:08.057
I smell.

01:00:28.183 --> 01:00:31.286
- Don't make any moves.
Just keep an eye on them.

01:00:31.287 --> 01:00:32.287
Yes, sir.

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:56.889
I wasn't very good, was I?

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:02.138
No, you were great. You were great.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.540
But you were so quiet.

01:01:10.937 --> 01:01:11.937
What?

01:01:14.408 --> 01:01:20.098
- Don't worry about that.
That's just one of my quirks.

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:26.254
I first started going out
with the boys during the war.

01:01:26.255 --> 01:01:27.657
I was already in the Resistance

01:01:27.658 --> 01:01:32.429
and sometimes made love
in conditions that were..

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:36.390
If I made the slightest sound, it was..

01:01:38.471 --> 01:01:44.471
So I trained myself to avoid
any loud displays of pleasure.

01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:53.455
I've never seen you smoke before.

01:01:53.456 --> 01:01:56.646
It's not my only first tonight.

01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:05.085
Was that your first?

01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:16.151
How did it happen?

01:02:18.353 --> 01:02:21.403
No, no
- the robbery, I mean.

01:02:24.295 --> 01:02:27.805
Do you really want me to tell you?

01:02:40.248 --> 01:02:43.184
1959 had got off to a good start.

01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:45.653
And I was back home
again, with my old friends

01:02:45.654 --> 01:02:47.704
after 10 years away.

01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:51.327
Hey. This is where I live!

01:02:51.328 --> 01:02:52.558
Hey, really?

01:02:53.698 --> 01:02:56.267
- I had been sent to
Moscow on a scholarship

01:02:56.268 --> 01:02:58.569
with a promising future
in political science.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.140
Only it wasn't so easy to be a student

01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:03.209
and to bring up a child at the same time

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.747
alone in a foreign country,
and without the father.

01:03:06.748 --> 01:03:09.283
In the meantime, the party had insisted

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:11.586
that Max acquire a marital
status worthy of his rank

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.421
and new social position.

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:19.227
My rebellious anti-bourgeois
ex-lover was now a married man.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:20.228
Mirel?

01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:26.958
Do you remember this gentleman?

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:30.768
See? He's forgotten you.

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:35.283
Are you a captain?

01:03:35.284 --> 01:03:36.284
Colonel.

01:03:37.152 --> 01:03:39.522
Your daddy's a colonel.

01:03:42.224 --> 01:03:43.726
In the following weeks

01:03:43.727 --> 01:03:48.298
Max started to take serious
charge of Mirel's education.

01:03:48.299 --> 01:03:51.759
He was determined to win him over.

01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:57.617
Mirel Radoiu, you're under arrest!

01:04:01.616 --> 01:04:04.753
Hey, everybody, I'm going to jail!

01:04:04.754 --> 01:04:07.422
- I wasn't too happy with all that play
- acting.

01:04:07.423 --> 01:04:09.625
I would have preferred
to keep Mirel as far away

01:04:09.626 --> 01:04:11.761
from the gang spirit as possible.

01:04:11.762 --> 01:04:14.664
You won't get anything from me.

01:04:14.665 --> 01:04:17.445
Well, we'll see about that!

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:23.144
I'll never talk.

01:04:23.145 --> 01:04:27.447
- Well, when we get to the
rifle range, then you'll talk.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.682
Yeah! Ha ha ha.

01:04:28.683 --> 01:04:30.517
But I didn't stand a chance.

01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:32.254
It was the most fascinating world

01:04:32.255 --> 01:04:34.224
anyone could offer
a 12-year-old boy.

01:04:34.225 --> 01:04:35.275
Very good!

01:04:35.759 --> 01:04:37.526
I hit 14 out of 20.

01:04:37.527 --> 01:04:41.757
- Hey, never point a
loaded gun at daddy.

01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:44.468
You never know when you might need him.

01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:47.572
Besides, he can still give
you a clip around the ear.

01:04:47.573 --> 01:04:48.853
Do it again.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:53.313
- One evening, Max
invited us to his house.

01:04:53.314 --> 01:04:55.849
He was the only one to own a television.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.350
Got everything?

01:04:58.354 --> 01:05:01.792
- Our guest today is
Comrade Dumitru Dorneanu

01:05:01.793 --> 01:05:05.229
astrophysicist and
space missions' expert.

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:09.220
- Good evening, comrade.
- Good evening.

01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:10.702
You're an expert, give 'em hell.

01:05:10.703 --> 01:05:12.604
Well, when Lunik 1 was launched

01:05:12.605 --> 01:05:14.405
in January of this year

01:05:14.406 --> 01:05:18.010
it reached escape velocity of
11.2 kilometers per second..

01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:19.946
Per second! Just think!

01:05:19.947 --> 01:05:23.447
Yeah, faster than your police cars.

01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:26.420
Which will carry the, Soviet banner

01:05:26.421 --> 01:05:30.727
all the way to the shining
surface, of the moon..

01:05:30.728 --> 01:05:31.961
Dinner's ready!

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.763
- Later, Sonia. We're
listening to Dumi now.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.767
On September 14, at precisely 7:30 am

01:05:36.768 --> 01:05:40.473
Moscow time, just east
of Damaris or Antartus..

01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:44.577
- Max, please, ask your
guests to come and sit down.

01:05:44.578 --> 01:05:46.512
I don't want to have to reheat dinner.

01:05:46.513 --> 01:05:49.718
- Yeah, be patient. Come and
listen to the man for a moment.

01:05:49.719 --> 01:05:52.452
- Max, for the last
time - - Shh. God!

01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:55.291
- ...to demonstrate to
the whole world that this

01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:56.892
is not really necessary to explode

01:05:56.893 --> 01:06:02.583
a nuclear bomb on the surface
of the moon in order to..

01:06:05.705 --> 01:06:06.705
Sonia..

01:06:08.342 --> 01:06:11.644
Sonia, we were watching the television.

01:06:11.645 --> 01:06:13.547
It was our friend Dumi.

01:06:13.548 --> 01:06:16.618
He was talking about interesting things.

01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:20.669
He was talking about flying to the moon.

01:06:21.557 --> 01:06:23.993
Now you're gonna fly to the moon.

01:06:23.994 --> 01:06:25.684
No! You, no. No!

01:06:32.038 --> 01:06:33.818
So, who's hungry?

01:06:35.008 --> 01:06:38.011
- The next day, Max sent a
copy of the divorce application

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:40.412
to his brother-in-law,
the minister.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:43.585
It wasn't long before he paid the price.

01:06:43.586 --> 01:06:44.636
Very good.

01:06:44.953 --> 01:06:46.593
Boris, sit down.

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:48.614
Talk to me.

01:06:48.826 --> 01:06:49.826
Not here.

01:06:51.527 --> 01:06:54.531
Word is, they're going to boot you out.

01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:57.492
Not right now, a few months..

01:06:58.537 --> 01:07:02.875
Wait for you to finish up
the cases you're working on.

01:07:02.876 --> 01:07:05.111
I thought you deserved to know.

01:07:05.112 --> 01:07:07.748
- Do you know who they're
gonna get to replace me?

01:07:07.749 --> 01:07:08.749
Yes.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.151
You?

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:11.986
Yes.

01:07:12.122 --> 01:07:14.122
Congratulations, Boris.

01:07:14.123 --> 01:07:17.594
Word of advice, the bottom
left-hand drawer of the desk

01:07:17.595 --> 01:07:19.597
it doesn't close properly.

01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:22.748
What's that got to do with it?

01:07:22.934 --> 01:07:26.404
- The idea came on the night
of Dumi's 40th birthday.

01:07:26.405 --> 01:07:28.141
We bought him a little telescope.

01:07:28.142 --> 01:07:30.743
Though Max was the one playing with it.

01:07:30.744 --> 01:07:32.812
Look at her. What a beauty!

01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:34.681
Reach out your hand you
can almost touch her.

01:07:34.682 --> 01:07:36.884
You poor romantic fool!

01:07:36.885 --> 01:07:38.421
There's no place for
that kind of thinking

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.423
in our new society, Max.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:44.728
Don't stare up at the moon,
but down, down at the people.

01:07:44.729 --> 01:07:47.164
Look inside the worker's paradise!

01:07:47.165 --> 01:07:49.675
When I am in your arms..

01:07:49.701 --> 01:07:50.701
Wow!

01:07:57.777 --> 01:08:00.377
When we walk hand in hand

01:08:01.617 --> 01:08:04.617
The world becomes a wonderland

01:08:06.455 --> 01:08:07.555
It's magic

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:15.423
How else can I explain..

01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:19.938
- Would you stop playing
with that thing for a moment

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:21.606
and come raise a glass to Dumi.

01:08:21.607 --> 01:08:22.886
It's magic..

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:28.595
Our boys at work.

01:08:28.716 --> 01:08:33.987
Anybody wanna come and see
the revolution in action?

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:37.194
Poor sap. You know him?

01:08:40.732 --> 01:08:43.703
No, not really. I mean, he's a drunk.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:47.506
Always in the local bar.
A bit of a big mouth.

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:48.647
The magic..

01:08:48.809 --> 01:08:51.578
It reminds me of my first arrest.

01:08:51.578 --> 01:08:52.979
I almost envy him.

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:56.216
When they first nabbed
me away, I was thrilled.

01:08:56.218 --> 01:08:58.585
Finally they knew who I was.

01:08:58.586 --> 01:09:00.121
A heroic life awaited..

01:09:00.122 --> 01:09:02.957
...investigation,
interrogation, detention..

01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:04.528
Remember your first time?

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:07.729
- "Shoot me now! Shoot me
right here on the street!"

01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:10.068
- You were what? 14? 15?
- I was 16 actually.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:11.870
Now are we gonna drink to Dumi or not?

01:09:11.871 --> 01:09:13.770
To the good old days!

01:09:13.772 --> 01:09:15.642
The good old days.

01:09:17.978 --> 01:09:19.145
Happy birthday.

01:09:19.147 --> 01:09:21.282
Madam, may I have the pleasure?

01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:23.251
- My mother always said,
he was a wonderful dancer.

01:09:23.252 --> 01:09:24.252
Yes.

01:09:27.023 --> 01:09:29.393
What do I tell myself..

01:09:31.127 --> 01:09:33.897
40 years old. I can't believe it.

01:09:33.898 --> 01:09:35.299
You should be writing your memoirs.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.770
- Well, screw you.
You're a fine one to talk!

01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:41.006
Prattling on like some old grandma.

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:43.207
Tell me this, if you're so
nostalgic for the struggle

01:09:43.209 --> 01:09:44.910
why aren't you still out there fighting?

01:09:44.911 --> 01:09:46.645
- On what front are
we supposed to fight?

01:09:46.647 --> 01:09:47.913
We won, remember?

01:09:47.915 --> 01:09:50.084
What would we have done 20 years ago?

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.653
Blown up a railway?

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.054
Well, that's no good anymore.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.024
That would just feed
their propaganda machine.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:57.060
"The class enemy within."

01:09:57.061 --> 01:09:58.061
Exactly.

01:10:05.605 --> 01:10:10.943
- Did any of you ever
consider the really hard stuff?

01:10:10.944 --> 01:10:12.764
Like family? Kids?

01:10:13.113 --> 01:10:15.016
Come on. Don't be serious.

01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:17.118
Sorry, ridiculous idea.

01:10:17.119 --> 01:10:18.251
We'd have to hit them where it hurts.

01:10:18.252 --> 01:10:19.354
Show them what fools they are.

01:10:19.355 --> 01:10:22.815
And blow up the People's Congress.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:27.230
- We live in a crime
- free society, right?

01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:29.834
No more murderers, robbers, thieves.

01:10:29.835 --> 01:10:32.371
- Communism means...
- There's nothing worth stealing.

01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:37.008
- Yeah. - No. Communism means the right
of the people

01:10:37.009 --> 01:10:39.078
to walk down the streets
without fear of being robbed.

01:10:39.079 --> 01:10:41.382
- So what? We should all
become purses snatchers?

01:10:41.383 --> 01:10:44.318
No, no, no!
Come on, you think too small, Yorgu.

01:10:44.319 --> 01:10:46.955
Let's hold up the greengrocers.

01:10:46.956 --> 01:10:48.957
- What? Greengrocers?
- Greengrocers.

01:10:48.958 --> 01:10:50.025
Did he just say Greengrocers?

01:10:50.026 --> 01:10:51.794
- Jewelers then?
- Boys!

01:10:51.795 --> 01:10:55.668
Boys! You really have no class, do you?

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:58.449
You want crime? Rob a bank.

01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:01.940
Which one then?

01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:03.809
- Well, we only have one,
The National Bank of Romania.

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:05.712
But if you have another suggestion..

01:11:05.713 --> 01:11:07.281
Big man, you're a genius.

01:11:07.282 --> 01:11:10.886
I was thinking the Socialist
Art Museum, but a bank..

01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:12.887
- I don't know. So we
rob the National Bank.

01:11:12.888 --> 01:11:14.691
What the hell does that prove?
- Well, don't you see?

01:11:14.692 --> 01:11:16.426
Bank robberies are one of
the evils of capitalism.

01:11:16.427 --> 01:11:18.193
They don't happen here.

01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:21.464
They can't happen here.
Everyone knows that.

01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:23.245
But if they did..

01:11:24.136 --> 01:11:25.937
If the impossible happened in the middle

01:11:25.938 --> 01:11:27.907
of all this progress
and plenty, you know what

01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:31.445
I might just sit up in my
factory and say, hang on a minute!

01:11:31.446 --> 01:11:33.046
It's a bit subtle, isn't it?

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:34.447
Anyway, what do we do with the money?

01:11:34.448 --> 01:11:37.185
Nothing.
Spend it, keep it, give it to you.

01:11:37.186 --> 01:11:39.054
Max, you're a cop.

01:11:39.055 --> 01:11:42.023
I mean, seriously, what are the
chances of actually pulling it off?

01:11:42.024 --> 01:11:43.254
Almost zero.

01:11:43.461 --> 01:11:45.495
You see, I do love the word almost.

01:11:45.496 --> 01:11:46.496
What?

01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:49.100
A minute ago, he was talking about
how much he missed being arrested.

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:50.334
Yeah, but nowadays it's different.

01:11:50.335 --> 01:11:52.870
Nowadays if they collar you,
it's good night for 40 years.

01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:54.740
- So what? The going got
tough and now you want out?

01:11:54.741 --> 01:11:57.977
- Max, please. I am an
old man, let's not forget.

01:11:57.978 --> 01:12:00.213
I'm not really built
for prison food anymore.

01:12:00.214 --> 01:12:03.116
- So the answer is,
steal over a 100,000.

01:12:03.117 --> 01:12:04.285
How is that the answer?

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.819
Because thefts of over a 100,000

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.789
is punishable by death.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.457
No long prison sentence,
just the bullet in the head.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.526
Well, this is great news, Max.

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:13.763
- So not less than 100,000.
It's all or nothing.

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:16.099
- Yeah, we'd have to
really humiliate them.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.035
Do it in public, in
front of an audience.

01:12:18.036 --> 01:12:20.304
- In that case, don't
attack the bank headquarters.

01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:25.412
Attack the van that delivers
money to the branches.

01:12:25.413 --> 01:12:27.080
And you said she was stupid.

01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:31.018
- And if you want a crowd,
you've got to make a show.

01:12:31.019 --> 01:12:34.355
We all wanted to become
movie stars, remember?

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:39.316
- You are an angel! Come
here, while I kiss you!

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.266
We all laid it on thick.

01:12:43.267 --> 01:12:44.835
We were showing off like kids.

01:12:44.836 --> 01:12:49.756
We hadn't felt so good
together in a long time.

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:52.312
But after a while, we
started to realize that

01:12:52.313 --> 01:12:56.049
one of us was actually
taking it all seriously.

01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.852
- We need to do it, while I'm
still head of the department.

01:12:58.853 --> 01:13:01.357
That way I can smuggle out weapons,
false papers, everything we need.

01:13:01.358 --> 01:13:07.318
- Whoa, Max, Max, don't tell
me you're serious about this.

01:13:07.399 --> 01:13:10.909
Of course I'm serious, aren't you?

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:14.171
No, Max. We're joking.

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.575
Who's joking? It's a brilliant idea!

01:13:15.576 --> 01:13:17.310
Maximillian, but you just told us

01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:19.579
it comes with a
guaranteed death sentence.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.580
So what?

01:13:21.182 --> 01:13:22.692
It's worth it!

01:13:22.884 --> 01:13:24.452
Say the Nazis had caught us in '44

01:13:24.453 --> 01:13:26.455
do you think we'd have got out alive?

01:13:26.456 --> 01:13:29.324
Did that stop us? No. And you know what?

01:13:29.325 --> 01:13:31.627
If we plan this right,
we've actually got

01:13:31.628 --> 01:13:33.329
a 5 to 10 percent chance
of getting away with it.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:34.470
Great odds.

01:13:35.533 --> 01:13:37.902
- What's the matter with you? You
looking forward to your retirement?

01:13:37.903 --> 01:13:39.872
This isn't even Russian Roulette.

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:42.341
It's Bolshevik Roulette, with
all 6 bullets in the barrel.

01:13:42.342 --> 01:13:44.032
It's about risk.

01:13:44.177 --> 01:13:47.080
Guys, come on, you used
to love taking risks!

01:13:47.081 --> 01:13:48.451
It's suicide.

01:13:49.918 --> 01:13:52.119
We might as well all
just jump off the roof.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.623
That's not a bad idea.

01:13:53.624 --> 01:13:55.191
But it's a short flight.

01:13:55.192 --> 01:13:59.061
I was just suggesting
a slightly longer one.

01:13:59.062 --> 01:14:02.365
Max, are you finished?
Then let's move on to some serious...

01:14:02.366 --> 01:14:05.246
I...think I'd be up for it.

01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:09.241
What?

01:14:14.549 --> 01:14:16.417
That is, I'd go along with Max.

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.487
- You're joking.
- Of course he's not.

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:20.155
You ever heard him joke before?

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:22.124
Dumi, don't encourage him.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.961
- No, listen, when they
cancelled my research grant

01:14:24.962 --> 01:14:28.398
in the Soviet Union, I
almost slit my wrists.

01:14:28.399 --> 01:14:30.333
Yeah, and you know what I
probably should have done it.

01:14:30.334 --> 01:14:31.570
Because instead I'm
just being interviewed

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:33.956
about space missions I should
have been helping organize.

01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:36.341
- And you know why they cut
your grant, don't you, Dumi?

01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:40.413
- But at least they're not
putting us in the ovens anymore.

01:14:40.414 --> 01:14:41.981
Not yet they're not.

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:44.672
Look it's Dumi's birthday.

01:14:45.322 --> 01:14:47.242
He's 40 years old.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:51.827
I hope he won't be angry with me

01:14:51.828 --> 01:14:55.208
if I don't wish him a long life.

01:14:57.068 --> 01:14:58.236
20 years ago, how many of us thought

01:14:58.237 --> 01:15:00.473
we'd live into our 40's?

01:15:00.474 --> 01:15:06.045
The sheer idea of a long life
back then was a kind of betrayal.

01:15:06.046 --> 01:15:09.784
Razvan, what's your best
memory in the last 10 years?

01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:13.421
Or can you think of one good
thing since the end of the war?

01:15:13.422 --> 01:15:15.257
The day Stalin died?

01:15:15.258 --> 01:15:16.258
Shut up.

01:15:16.392 --> 01:15:19.082
What else is there for us?

01:15:20.532 --> 01:15:25.136
If we pull it off, great.
We're laughing, at them.

01:15:25.137 --> 01:15:29.509
If we get caught, sure,
it's the end of the show.

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:31.470
But what an ending?

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.790
Who'll drink to that with me?

01:16:07.957 --> 01:16:11.507
Purely for the sake of team spirit.

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:17.167
- I'm sorry, I can't
play death with you.

01:16:17.168 --> 01:16:19.948
I have your child to raise.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:40.111
Over the next few days,
things started to move fast.

01:16:57.653 --> 01:17:00.689
- Write a declaration that
you are so-and-so taxi driver

01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:02.958
of such-and-such a
cab, model and number.

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:04.827
Put down the exact details

01:17:04.828 --> 01:17:08.698
of where and when your car was stolen.

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.670
Max Rosenthal in a park?

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:21.639
Knock me down with a feather.

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:48.783
It's better if we keep them here.

01:17:48.784 --> 01:17:51.064
My place is too risky.

01:17:52.255 --> 01:17:53.690
Sonia keeps turning up for her stuff

01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:54.890
and rifling through everything.

01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:57.694
- Max. I
- I'll store them here for you.

01:17:57.695 --> 01:18:01.795
But don't count on me for anything else.

01:18:02.033 --> 01:18:03.813
What do you mean?

01:18:06.839 --> 01:18:10.276
I think I'd rather watch
everything from a distance.

01:18:10.277 --> 01:18:13.480
I've been thinking
it over, and you see..

01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:15.171
I'm a historian.

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:19.054
I'm curious about what's gotta
happen in the years ahead.

01:18:19.055 --> 01:18:21.056
I want to be alive to see it.

01:18:21.057 --> 01:18:22.992
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

01:18:22.993 --> 01:18:23.993
Nothing.

01:18:24.796 --> 01:18:27.263
You're gonna carry on teaching
fake history to ignorant kids

01:18:27.264 --> 01:18:33.264
until you wanna shoot yourself,
that's what's gonna happen.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:37.200
So make your choice. Now or later?

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:43.215
Hey, I'm only joking, big man.

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:48.092
Of course if you want
out, you're free to go.

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:50.591
I'm sorry, Max.

01:18:55.233 --> 01:18:56.300
How dare you?

01:18:56.301 --> 01:18:57.934
Don't get hysterical.

01:18:57.935 --> 01:18:59.537
He came here begging me to count him in.

01:18:59.538 --> 01:19:01.372
Of course I said no.

01:19:01.373 --> 01:19:03.242
Where is he? Mirel!

01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:04.477
He's locked himself in the bathroom.

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:05.677
He doesn't want to talk to you.

01:19:05.678 --> 01:19:08.549
- How did he find out about
the plan? Did you tell him?

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:10.785
- The boys were talking about it
when we went to steal the camera.

01:19:10.786 --> 01:19:11.986
No, I'm not coming out, go away.

01:19:11.987 --> 01:19:14.357
- He's only 12 years old.
Can't you just leave him alone?

01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:16.792
- I would, I swear.
But he's nuts about it.

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:18.128
He knows when and
where it's gonna happen.

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:19.463
He's threatening to come
whether we like it or not.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.265
- Max, you have to stop
him, talk him out of it.

01:19:21.266 --> 01:19:22.498
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:24.969
- Believe me, I've tried.
- Try harder.

01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:27.540
You won him over, now he's
also your responsibility.

01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:28.874
Look, if you don't stop him

01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:30.442
I'll turn you all over to the police.

01:19:30.443 --> 01:19:33.413
- Alice Bercovich naming
names. That will be the day.

01:19:33.414 --> 01:19:38.514
- Well then we'll just
leave. I'll take him away.

01:19:39.022 --> 01:19:42.058
- I'm not coming out.
- He won't go.

01:19:42.059 --> 01:19:44.789
- You
- you are a monster.

01:19:46.396 --> 01:19:48.031
You want him to go.

01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:51.034
You want to make another Max out of him.

01:19:51.035 --> 01:19:54.135
Well, he is my son, after all.

01:19:54.172 --> 01:19:56.272
He wants it so much.

01:19:56.977 --> 01:19:58.578
Besides, it's already
arranged for 5 people.

01:19:58.579 --> 01:20:01.315
It's too late to change
now. And Alice, he's a minor.

01:20:01.316 --> 01:20:02.983
Even if they do arrest
us, all they'll do

01:20:02.984 --> 01:20:04.319
is make him change schools.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.780
He stays home.

01:20:13.497 --> 01:20:15.637
You need five people?

01:20:23.477 --> 01:20:26.246
So you changed your mind after all?

01:20:26.247 --> 01:20:28.807
I'm a woman. I'm fickle.

01:20:29.516 --> 01:20:33.021
- Look who's talking
about changing their mind.

01:20:33.022 --> 01:20:35.072
I'll cook something.

01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:38.701
Y
- you'll all be hungry by noon.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:03.225
Hey! Hey!

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:05.133
Stop! Stop.

01:21:09.267 --> 01:21:10.457
I'm coming.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.146
- Here are the keys
to the filing Cabinet.

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:21.147
Yup.

01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:23.684
The files are all up to date.

01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:25.252
What else is there to say?

01:21:25.253 --> 01:21:29.893
- That it's been a
pleasure working with you.

01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:34.736
I almost forgot.

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:36.699
I put all my personal belongings

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.536
in one of our vans to
have them taken home.

01:21:38.537 --> 01:21:40.039
- Well, I'll get you a driver.
- No need, Boris.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:45.345
I'll take care of it. You'll have
the van back in the garage by tomorrow

01:21:45.346 --> 01:21:46.714
Good luck with your new life.

01:21:46.715 --> 01:21:49.216
- You too, Max. With
everything you set out to do.

01:21:49.217 --> 01:21:53.317
- Yeah. - I hope one
day we'll get to -

01:22:11.746 --> 01:22:13.656
Good day, comrades.

01:22:13.714 --> 01:22:17.814
Don't be alarmed, we're shooting a film.

01:22:19.355 --> 01:22:20.421
It's very simple. Let me explain.

01:22:20.422 --> 01:22:21.657
We pretend to rob you.

01:22:21.658 --> 01:22:23.459
- Get out of the car slowly,
with your hands in the air.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.961
Just like you've seen in the movies.

01:22:24.962 --> 01:22:27.230
- Come on! Come on! come on!
- But we have to deliver -

01:22:27.231 --> 01:22:28.465
- Where's your weapon?
- We're not armed.

01:22:28.466 --> 01:22:29.666
I don't believe it.

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:32.237
Those morons let you transport
money without any weapons?

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:35.338
You, put the money in the van.

01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:38.432
The money in the van.

01:22:40.213 --> 01:22:44.117
Come on, come on. Come on,
guys, show some enthusiasm.

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:46.168
You're being filmed.

01:22:46.255 --> 01:22:47.356
You'd think it was their money!

01:22:47.357 --> 01:22:49.792
- I don't know what put
them in such a bad mood.

01:22:49.793 --> 01:22:51.661
What's your name?
- Viorel.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:52.795
What's wrong, Viorel?

01:22:52.796 --> 01:22:54.297
Aren't you excited to be in a movie?

01:22:54.298 --> 01:22:55.733
Maybe he doesn't like his part?

01:22:55.734 --> 01:22:57.402
Well he should have said.

01:22:57.403 --> 01:23:01.633
You know what, Viorel.
You can have mine!

01:23:02.241 --> 01:23:04.609
What about him? Maybe he wants
to change his part. Ask him.

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:06.020
With pleasure.

01:23:22.201 --> 01:23:25.170
Take the money, spare our lives.

01:23:25.171 --> 01:23:27.705
Can we stop the clowning and go home?

01:23:27.706 --> 01:23:30.309
Why, I'm just having some fun.

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:33.379
Since when do we have a real cameraman?

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.610
You bastard!

01:23:40.188 --> 01:23:42.058
Please. I beg you.

01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:45.696
- Don't worry! We're
just making a film!

01:23:45.697 --> 01:23:47.831
- Down, now!
- Let's go.

01:23:47.832 --> 01:23:49.152
Thanks. Here.

01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:56.409
Ta-dah. Come on, Viorel. Forward march.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.877
You've played your parts very well.

01:23:57.878 --> 01:24:01.068
Now get over to the police van.

01:24:09.659 --> 01:24:14.159
Not that you were very
talkative, but still.

01:24:30.952 --> 01:24:32.862
Right. Left. Right.

01:24:34.356 --> 01:24:36.926
- No, I want to come with
you and split the money.

01:24:36.927 --> 01:24:38.528
Out of the question.

01:24:38.529 --> 01:24:40.463
You stay here, rehearse
for the big parade

01:24:40.464 --> 01:24:44.204
and don't come back until it's over.

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:46.500
Left. Right.

01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:53.361
Thank you, both

01:24:54.215 --> 01:24:58.485
for taking part in a
masterpiece of socialist cinema.

01:24:58.486 --> 01:25:00.906
You are free to go. Go!

01:25:30.929 --> 01:25:33.159
You traitor! You liar.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:37.001
You bastard, you lied to me!
- Stop it. Stop, stop!

01:25:37.002 --> 01:25:39.570
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't me.

01:25:39.571 --> 01:25:42.491
It wasn't me. I swear. Stop.

01:25:43.042 --> 01:25:44.682
Be good. Listen.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.481
I did not lie to you.

01:25:47.482 --> 01:25:49.349
I locked him in the house
when I left this morning.

01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.750
He must have broken a window.

01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:53.588
I swear to you, he came here by himself.

01:25:53.589 --> 01:25:55.758
Alice, don't worry for
a second about Mirel.

01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:58.760
Even if we're all arrested tomorrow,
nothing's gonna happen to him.

01:25:58.761 --> 01:26:00.496
I'll have false papers made for him.

01:26:00.497 --> 01:26:01.866
His address will be secret.

01:26:01.867 --> 01:26:03.033
You and I will be the only two people

01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:06.174
who'll know anything about him.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.000
Why are you crying?

01:26:11.912 --> 01:26:13.812
That's what I didn't want.

01:26:13.813 --> 01:26:16.483
I didn't..
- What didn't you want?

01:26:16.484 --> 01:26:17.918
What do you mean? Tell me!

01:26:17.919 --> 01:26:21.023
That's what I didn't want for Mirel.

01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:22.858
I didn't want to have him -

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:28.239
I didn't want for him to
have to hide all his life.

01:26:38.012 --> 01:26:41.081
The police investigation
started the next day.

01:26:41.082 --> 01:26:43.684
Newspapers never printed a word

01:26:43.685 --> 01:26:45.587
but people were
whispering all over town.

01:26:45.588 --> 01:26:49.091
We
- we became Romanian Robin Hoods.

01:26:49.092 --> 01:26:51.642
And after about two weeks

01:26:51.895 --> 01:26:54.464
the Minister of the Interior
ordered the secret police

01:26:54.465 --> 01:26:56.667
to take over the case.

01:26:56.668 --> 01:26:58.135
Overnight, we were
- we were upgraded

01:26:58.136 --> 01:27:02.976
from ordinary brigands
to enemies of the people.

01:27:02.977 --> 01:27:05.377
It became a political case.

01:27:05.378 --> 01:27:09.582
Meanwhile, we ate at the
Atheneic Palace every night

01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:12.133
we bought lots of clothes

01:27:12.688 --> 01:27:14.148
the high life.

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:18.058
So how did they find you?

01:27:18.429 --> 01:27:20.996
- Yorgu.
- No, he turned you in?

01:27:20.997 --> 01:27:22.137
Not really.

01:27:23.068 --> 01:27:25.569
It all started with a phone conversation

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:27.607
he had with another teacher.

01:27:27.608 --> 01:27:30.642
They were discussing a
couple of pupils in his class

01:27:30.643 --> 01:27:32.712
who were being persecuted
because their parents

01:27:32.713 --> 01:27:33.880
were former land-owners.

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.849
Yes, but I have to say

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.484
and I hope you won't judge me for this.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:41.489
They're all hard-working,
highly intelligent students.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:42.540
No really.

01:27:42.994 --> 01:27:46.196
You wouldn't believe the
treasures they have hiding up there

01:27:46.197 --> 01:27:49.566
- The treasures they
have hiding up there.

01:27:49.567 --> 01:27:51.902
That's the sentence that sent us away.

01:27:51.903 --> 01:27:54.440
My neighbor, Comrade Ristea

01:27:54.441 --> 01:27:57.176
has a treasure hidden up in his attic.

01:27:57.177 --> 01:27:58.587
Probably gold.

01:28:07.825 --> 01:28:09.605
The fun was over.

01:28:10.126 --> 01:28:13.529
During the next 24 hours
the Communist Secret Police

01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:16.666
made up for a whole
month of inefficiency.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:22.667
- Who was the brilliant leader
of the Great October Revolution?

01:28:25.945 --> 01:28:27.905
Last door. Class 3.

01:28:28.616 --> 01:28:31.296
A certain, Vladimir Ilyich?

01:28:31.652 --> 01:28:33.202
Ring any bells?

01:28:37.227 --> 01:28:38.277
Be seated.

01:28:39.963 --> 01:28:43.553
Are you Ristea Yorgu, born Feldiman?

01:28:46.037 --> 01:28:49.577
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, born Ulianov?

01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:38.570
Hey.

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:55.197
Today we celebrate a historic day.

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:58.227
To learn more about this
awe-inspiring victory

01:29:58.228 --> 01:30:00.798
for the communist heroes
of the Soviet Union

01:30:00.799 --> 01:30:04.369
we turn now to our expert in
astro-physics and space missions

01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:06.820
Comrade Dumitru Dorneanu.

01:30:07.139 --> 01:30:10.076
- Believe it or not, it
happened on September 14th.

01:30:10.077 --> 01:30:15.307
The day, the Lunik 2
satellite, landed on the moon.

01:30:19.723 --> 01:30:21.823
Max had won his bet.

01:30:53.665 --> 01:30:55.125
Um...yes, um..

01:31:37.419 --> 01:31:40.739
Good morning. What are you doing?

01:31:41.891 --> 01:31:43.792
These are instructions for you.

01:31:43.793 --> 01:31:46.762
Don't read them today. Wait
until the filming is over.

01:31:46.763 --> 01:31:52.069
And...if it seems complicated, then
you can discuss it with Mr. Zilber.

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:54.630
I'm sure he'll help you.

01:31:54.806 --> 01:31:56.274
Come on, wake up.

01:31:56.275 --> 01:32:01.425
We had a lovely night.
But now it's back to work.

01:32:08.925 --> 01:32:10.205
Shall we go?

01:32:11.128 --> 01:32:16.668
Martyrs' Square, please. And
hurry. We're already late.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.490
There they are.

01:32:42.833 --> 01:32:45.753
Come, I want to talk to you.

01:32:48.875 --> 01:32:49.875
Sit down.

01:32:56.217 --> 01:32:59.886
Now, I want you to write
something very simple.

01:32:59.887 --> 01:33:01.117
The address.

01:33:13.873 --> 01:33:15.153
What's this?

01:33:15.308 --> 01:33:18.310
- It's my address.
I mean, Mr. Zilber's.

01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:19.446
You're trying to play smart with me?

01:33:19.447 --> 01:33:21.348
- Why would I? You know that's
where we spent the night.

01:33:21.349 --> 01:33:22.515
Your men were on watch the whole time.

01:33:22.516 --> 01:33:25.419
- I want you to give
me the other address.

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.420
I don't know any other address.

01:33:26.421 --> 01:33:28.624
Believe me! If I did,
I would give it to you.

01:33:28.625 --> 01:33:33.095
- Virgil, my friend.
You see...how tired I am?

01:33:33.096 --> 01:33:36.934
Do you know how many sleepless
nights, I have been having?

01:33:36.935 --> 01:33:40.605
Last night was the fourth.
Why are you doing this to me?

01:33:40.606 --> 01:33:42.609
- I'm sorry,
I - - Listen!

01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:46.345
I'm in no hurry. I'll give you
the whole day to think about it.

01:33:46.346 --> 01:33:49.415
But if you don't comply, you'll
be taken in for questioning..

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:51.652
...by other officers with other methods.

01:33:51.653 --> 01:33:57.092
You will end up giving the
address just to someone else.

01:33:57.093 --> 01:33:59.495
And that would be very sad for me.

01:33:59.496 --> 01:34:02.899
Think of all the time and
effort, I've put in to this.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:06.036
The young Bercovich is a key element.

01:34:06.037 --> 01:34:09.917
A secret I've told to no one but you.

01:34:09.975 --> 01:34:15.485
Why let any old fool take
the credit for all my work?

01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:20.922
Meanwhile, the sun won't wait.

01:34:20.923 --> 01:34:26.013
Your assistant will have
to work the camera today.

01:34:28.432 --> 01:34:29.752
And...action!

01:34:50.327 --> 01:34:51.607
On with you.

01:35:00.305 --> 01:35:02.485
Stop! Stop everything.

01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:05.444
Get their guns. Get their guns.

01:35:05.445 --> 01:35:07.225
Give me the guns!

01:35:07.347 --> 01:35:12.027
- Prisoners back in the van.
- Get away. Move!

01:35:15.056 --> 01:35:16.623
- Who's our man in
charge of this operation?

01:35:16.624 --> 01:35:18.393
Lt. Col. Holban, sir.

01:35:18.394 --> 01:35:20.674
Where is he? Find him!

01:35:24.634 --> 01:35:27.544
Comrade Holban, sir! Wake up!

01:35:27.573 --> 01:35:30.483
The Comrade Minister is here!

01:35:34.547 --> 01:35:38.187
Find me somewhere quiet we can talk.

01:35:38.353 --> 01:35:40.221
Hey, you! Get us some coffee!

01:35:40.222 --> 01:35:42.457
Did I interrupt your nap, comrade?

01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:44.226
I beg your pardon. The exhaustion..

01:35:44.227 --> 01:35:46.797
- As you're exhausted, we can
offer you an extended holiday!

01:35:46.798 --> 01:35:50.133
There's no room in my
Ministry for exhaustion.

01:35:50.134 --> 01:35:53.238
I suppose, you were asleep yesterday
as well, when a prisoner got away..

01:35:53.239 --> 01:35:57.107
...with a gun in broad daylight!
I've got the report right here.

01:35:57.108 --> 01:35:59.078
I've never known anything like it.

01:35:59.079 --> 01:36:01.380
- Yes, sir, comrade, but we
have recaptured the fugitive.

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:03.583
- After she strolled
around the city all night!

01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:06.219
- If you will allow me to
inform you of a new element

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.355
that has come to light
in the investigation -

01:36:07.356 --> 01:36:10.124
- What investigation! This
case has already been tried!

01:36:10.125 --> 01:36:12.393
We're talking gross
negligence in the line of duty!

01:36:12.394 --> 01:36:16.934
- Please, sir - - Shut
your fat-little-mouth.

01:36:17.768 --> 01:36:20.598
I want to hear you shut up!

01:36:22.241 --> 01:36:24.201
Where's the coffee?

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:26.679
- Excuse me, sir, I'm
not actually a waiter.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.550
What are you then?

01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:31.652
I'm in charge of the camera.

01:36:31.653 --> 01:36:35.253
So go and take care of your camera.

01:36:39.161 --> 01:36:41.630
Now, you pack your bags tonight.

01:36:41.631 --> 01:36:43.361
You're exhausted.

01:36:43.434 --> 01:36:45.636
So we're sending you
off to get some rest.

01:36:45.637 --> 01:36:49.007
In a work camp. In the mountains.

01:36:49.141 --> 01:36:51.011
Lots of fresh air.

01:36:55.516 --> 01:36:56.649
Prisoner Radoiu.

01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:57.650
Get out.

01:37:06.729 --> 01:37:09.866
- I want you to know,
all of this was my idea.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:10.867
What?

01:37:11.202 --> 01:37:13.770
All of this. The film. The shooting.

01:37:13.771 --> 01:37:16.810
- Well, good for you.
I've always loved movies.

01:37:16.811 --> 01:37:18.912
All that will be left of you..

01:37:18.913 --> 01:37:21.380
...will be the image of
a traitor and criminal

01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:23.482
captured by the men in my command.

01:37:23.483 --> 01:37:27.221
A hundred years from now, people
will see this film and they'll say..

01:37:27.222 --> 01:37:30.225
...it can't have been easy to
build socialism in the early days.

01:37:30.226 --> 01:37:34.931
Luckily, there were men
like me around to do it.

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:36.212
How's Sonia?

01:37:36.499 --> 01:37:38.501
You don't worry about her.

01:37:38.502 --> 01:37:41.540
She's fine. -
Com-Mr. Minister..

01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.543
- They've taught you how
to address me properly.

01:37:43.544 --> 01:37:46.412
Well, a convict is no comrade of mine.

01:37:46.413 --> 01:37:49.249
- I've got a proposition.
Concerns the entire group.

01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:51.785
Instead of executing us with bullets..

01:37:51.786 --> 01:37:56.191
...why not send us into
space in a Soviet satellite?

01:37:56.192 --> 01:37:58.929
Then we could be of use to
science. Everyone would win.

01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:01.262
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No, no, no.

01:38:01.263 --> 01:38:03.666
I'm deadly serious. Why sacrifice dogs?

01:38:03.667 --> 01:38:05.401
It would be much smarter to send humans

01:38:05.402 --> 01:38:07.204
because they can send back observations

01:38:07.205 --> 01:38:09.674
and records of everything
they see before they die.

01:38:09.675 --> 01:38:14.680
Imagine. We could have a man
in space before the Americans!

01:38:14.681 --> 01:38:17.984
- Now you listen to
me, you miserable scum!

01:38:17.985 --> 01:38:20.988
Anyone sent into space
is a hero of the people.

01:38:20.989 --> 01:38:22.456
Dogs or no dogs!

01:38:22.457 --> 01:38:24.692
Traitors and saboteurs
are not sent into space.

01:38:24.693 --> 01:38:26.528
They are sent before a firing squad

01:38:26.529 --> 01:38:28.864
and their families have
to pay for the bullets!

01:38:28.865 --> 01:38:32.368
Now that's enough! Back to
the cells! The party's over!

01:38:32.369 --> 01:38:34.473
Everyone back to their cells!

01:38:34.474 --> 01:38:36.675
Since when has a prison
become a holiday camp?

01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:41.136
You've got enough stuff
to finish the film!

01:39:09.483 --> 01:39:10.853
That was fun.

01:39:21.698 --> 01:39:23.108
"Dear Virgil..

01:39:23.701 --> 01:39:26.805
"...now you know where my child lives.

01:39:26.806 --> 01:39:29.874
"He will be 13 on August, the 26th.

01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:33.779
"In Jewish tradition, that's
the day of his Bar Mitzvah..

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.384
"..a ceremony at the
synagogue followed by a party.

01:39:37.385 --> 01:39:43.385
"This is how young boys become
accepted as members of the community.

01:39:45.961 --> 01:39:47.741
Come on, come on.

01:39:48.397 --> 01:39:51.037
Faster.
- Don't touch me.

01:39:56.007 --> 01:39:59.077
- "I would dearly like to
find someone trustworthy

01:39:59.078 --> 01:40:01.980
"who could organize
this ceremony for Mirel.

01:40:01.981 --> 01:40:06.587
"And I would be so happy if you
could do it. With Mr. Zilber's help.

01:40:06.588 --> 01:40:10.091
"I'm asking you to please help me.

01:40:10.092 --> 01:40:13.127
"And I want you to know that you gave me

01:40:13.128 --> 01:40:16.858
the last beautiful night of my life."

01:41:31.027 --> 01:41:32.027
Fire!

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:05.100
Ready!

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:07.203
Aim!

01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:08.205
Fire!

01:42:32.537 --> 01:42:33.537
Ready!

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.140
Aim!

01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:38.611
Fire!

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.217
Attention!

01:43:14.255 --> 01:43:15.255
Ready!

01:43:18.795 --> 01:43:19.795
Aim!

01:43:41.123 --> 01:43:44.627
- As for me, things
turned out differently.

01:43:44.628 --> 01:43:45.928
At the last minute

01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:48.965
my sentence was commuted
to life imprisonment.

01:43:48.966 --> 01:43:53.068
My life was spared because a
few days before the execution

01:43:53.069 --> 01:43:54.914
it came out that..

01:43:54.949 --> 01:43:56.759
...I was pregnant.

01:44:28.314 --> 01:44:30.774
You sigh the song begins

01:44:33.688 --> 01:44:36.558
You speak and I hear violins

01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:40.961
It's magic

01:44:45.903 --> 01:44:48.543
The stars desert the skies

01:44:49.942 --> 01:44:53.132
And rush to nestle in your eyes

01:44:55.115 --> 01:44:56.215
It's magic

01:44:59.187 --> 01:45:01.327
Without a golden wand

01:45:06.963 --> 01:45:08.603
Or mystic charms

01:45:14.372 --> 01:45:16.552
Fantastic things begin

01:45:21.347 --> 01:45:23.677
When I am in your arms

01:45:31.495 --> 01:45:34.095
When we walk hand in hand

01:45:35.466 --> 01:45:38.466
The world becomes a wonderland

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:41.470
It's magic

01:45:47.113 --> 01:45:49.393
How else can I explain

01:45:51.184 --> 01:45:54.914
Those raindrops when there is no rain

01:45:55.857 --> 01:45:56.957
It's magic

01:46:00.163 --> 01:46:02.263
Why do I tell myself

01:46:07.939 --> 01:46:10.349
These things that happen

01:46:11.243 --> 01:46:13.203
Are all really true

01:46:18.019 --> 01:46:20.439
When in my heart I know

01:46:21.557 --> 01:46:24.477
The magic is my love for you

01:46:40.547 --> 01:46:41.647
It's magic

01:46:55.899 --> 01:46:56.999
It's magic

01:47:01.173 --> 01:47:03.313
Without a golden wand

01:47:08.447 --> 01:47:10.087
Or mystic charms

01:47:16.323 --> 01:47:18.503
Fantastic things begin

01:47:23.634 --> 01:47:25.964
When I am in your arms

01:48:02.049 --> 01:48:04.149
Why do I tell myself

01:48:09.692 --> 01:48:12.102
These things that happen

01:48:13.162 --> 01:48:15.122
Are all really true

01:48:19.703 --> 01:48:22.123
When in my heart I know

01:48:24.343 --> 01:48:26.443
The magic is my love

01:48:30.316 --> 01:48:31.316
