00:00.117 --> 00:02.032
Why have I never noticed
this before?

00:02.035 --> 00:04.261
Is he not the very spit and
image of Uncle Ross?

00:04.263 --> 00:08.238
My child is due in December. I'd
prefer it to be born in November.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.238
I shall make up a medicine
to produce a living

00:10.240 --> 00:11.798
child in the manner you desire.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.798
I will have you expelled
from parliament!

00:13.800 --> 00:15.198
Will you, George?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.998
And how will you manage that?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.878
Promise me you won't
go after George.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.678
I couldn't bear to have the feud
stoked up again.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.198
Both of us have been afflicted
by the loss of our daughter.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.438
Our abiding love for each other
will mend what has been broken.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.158
You have a daughter.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.518
Do you not think there be more to
life than carnal love?

00:35.520 --> 00:39.678
Be my wife in name only,
I'll never ask you for more.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.758
Why is it so dark, George?
I'm afraid of the dark.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.040
Do not be afraid, my love.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.598
Elizabeth is dead.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.520
Go! See what we have brought her to!

00:50.680 --> 00:53.158
Why would I want any of this

00:53.160 --> 00:56.158
if she is not here to share
it with me?

00:56.160 --> 00:58.238
Elizabeth was your first love.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.078
But not my last.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.438
I made that choice long ago.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.480
And I.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.638
They had no chance.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.358
By the time we arrived,
it was all over.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.518
Any other survivors?

01:44.520 --> 01:46.078
None.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.318
And if you lose this one,
you'll have me to answer to.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.600
I'll do my best, colonel.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.998
Stay with us, friend.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.678
You're a mad fool, but we
need mad fools here!

01:56.680 --> 01:58.158
Colonel Despard...

01:58.160 --> 01:59.638
Ensign Poldark.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.678
I think you'll find you're
Captain Poldark now.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.118
Stitch him up, Enys.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.280
His war's not over yet.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.078
You've got an hour.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.120
Thank you.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.000
Those who would help cannot.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.800
Those who could help will not.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.360
Perhaps this one will.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.000
Will he remember?

03:25.280 --> 03:26.320
He'll remember.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.360
Valentine?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.918
Bessie, go and fetch the boy.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.358
I won't go.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.918
I won't, I won't.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.518
I don't want to go to Truro.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.560
That's enough.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.720
Drive on!

05:48.720 --> 05:50.440
There's someone waiting for you.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.878
Geoffrey Charles.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.918
Geoffrey Charles, where
have you been?

05:55.920 --> 05:56.960
We've missed you.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.480
Aunt Demelza!

06:03.560 --> 06:05.120
So dull, being an orphan.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.960
No home, no funds, no estate.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.640
No Mama to complain to.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.600
You have us.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.158
Don't think I'm not grateful.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.960
But now, having only myself
to please...

06:22.760 --> 06:24.878
..I think I shan't return to Harrow

06:24.880 --> 06:25.920
nor go on to Oxford.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.038
I shall look to make my own
way in the world.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.478
And go where?

06:30.480 --> 06:33.118
The new Military Academy
at Great Marlow.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.678
I thought to enrol as a cadet.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.558
Which will require
considerable funds.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.838
No!

06:39.840 --> 06:42.758
I swear, I'll starve before I take
a penny from that man.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.800
We'll see.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.918
Wheal Plenty.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.598
Yes?

06:50.600 --> 06:54.920
Nicknamed Wheal Scarcity since
you savaged wages.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.238
Was that wise?

06:59.240 --> 07:02.200
Why should we pay more for labour
when we can get it for less?

07:03.640 --> 07:05.920
When was the last time you
entertained?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.120
I've no taste for company.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.680
Captain Ross Poldark and Mr
Geoffrey Charles Poldark.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.998
How are you, George?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.038
Positively joyous.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.920
As befits a man shortly to be
ennobled by the king.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.398
So it is true, you quit Trenwith?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.998
Mm. Without a backward glance.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.078
For all I care, it can rot
where it stands.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.238
Well, in that case...

07:37.240 --> 07:40.478
It can tolerate some neglect till
Geoffrey Charles comes of age.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.038
Speaking of which - your stepson has
decided to leave Harrow

07:44.040 --> 07:46.118
and train for the military.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.878
Well, I wish him a speedy bullet!

07:47.880 --> 07:49.118
And I wish you a...

07:49.120 --> 07:52.878
As you know, his father left
him without capital.

07:52.880 --> 07:57.438
There was, I believe, an undertaking
from you to provide for him

07:57.440 --> 07:58.480
until he came of age.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.718
A spoiled brat who makes no effort
to disguise his loathing?

08:03.720 --> 08:06.398
Why would I lay out a penny for
him?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.920
Because you loved his mother.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.158
Get out.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.400
George, I sympathise more
than you know.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.958
If you dislike the military,
I have another suggestion -

08:21.960 --> 08:23.000
Wheal Leisure.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.958
Wheal Leisure?

08:25.960 --> 08:28.038
The boy once demonstrated
an interest in mining.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.360
Perhaps he could revive
her fortunes?

08:32.280 --> 08:34.159
We both know she was
never worked out.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.880
Take this as my final word.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.798
Wheal Leisure...

08:47.800 --> 08:50.240
..will never again be
a Poldark mine.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.160
Remove these persons from my house.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.040
A toast...

10:37.120 --> 10:38.160
..to this house.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.198
And to my mother...

10:42.200 --> 10:43.240
..Elizabeth.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.798
To Elizabeth.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.478
To Elizabeth!

10:47.480 --> 10:48.520
Elizabeth.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.958
And to my father - and Aunt Agatha -

10:55.960 --> 10:59.598
and all who bear the Poldark
name - past and present.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.120
To Poldarks, past and present.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.158
And to the king!

11:07.160 --> 11:09.958
Soon to be honoured by meeting
Sir George.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.400
What's the king done to deserve it?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.718
Here's to the new century.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.040
What do it hold for us?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.278
The Royal College of Surgeons has
invited me to join their ranks.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.398
And their inaugural
dinner in London.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.958
Which Caroline has declined.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.758
Horace prefers summer in Cornwall.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.678
Well, I shall join you.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.438
I have friends in London.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.718
And I must try to persuade the
Academy to hold my place

11:36.720 --> 11:39.040
until I can beg, steal or
borrow funds.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.598
Speaking of begging -
may I ask a favour?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.838
Will you look in here
from time to time?

11:45.840 --> 11:46.880
Light a fire?

11:48.480 --> 11:50.918
Put winter primroses in the window?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.038
If you wish it so.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.998
I wish it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.240
This is a Poldark house.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.840
Keep it safe for us, please.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.878
So strong and full of life.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.920
Elizabeth.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.520
So cruel to have her snatched away.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.400
Childbirth can be hazardous.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.600
So can motherhood.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.840
One thing I guarantee...

12:29.040 --> 12:30.560
..you will not share her fate.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.160
I pity Geoffrey Charles.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.640
The loss of his mother...

12:45.040 --> 12:46.520
He'll recover.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.040
Now he's found a way forward.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.160
Or at least, a distraction.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.840
Life must go forward.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.360
Nothing is constant.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.320
Except me.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.800
Except you.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.798
And sometimes, perhaps, I take
that for granted.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.558
I think perhaps you do.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.878
Sometimes you give me grief.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.600
Sometimes you give the like to me!

13:20.880 --> 13:21.920
But...

13:23.480 --> 13:26.360
..for better or for worse...

13:28.440 --> 13:29.640
..in contentment or...

13:31.880 --> 13:32.920
..or in strife...

13:34.640 --> 13:36.960
..nothing in my life has meaning
without you.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.478
Nor mine without you.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.080
And no matter what the
future brings...

13:47.680 --> 13:49.200
..and what may come between us...

13:51.960 --> 13:53.280
..that you can rely on.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.038
Forgive me - the London coach
was early.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.878
I came here directly.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.720
My husband bid me bring this letter.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.398
He said I should warn you -

14:39.400 --> 14:42.760
if you take on his case, it may be
the rashest thing you ever do.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.800
My name is Catherine Despard.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.440
Ned's wife?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.638
He said you'd remember.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.680
Show me the letter.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.598
"Dear friend, I hesitate to
appeal to you,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.680
"the task being perilous and
uncertain.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.880
"But I am desperate and you
are my last hope."

15:14.640 --> 15:16.198
So, erm...

15:16.200 --> 15:18.118
..your husband, he know'd mine...

15:18.120 --> 15:19.160
In America.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.158
When yours came home, mine went on
to fight on the Spanish Main.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.960
Was much decorated, then
made governor.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.040
-How... How did you come to...?
-Be his wife?

15:35.680 --> 15:37.320
I was his kitchen maid.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.398
No, no...

15:41.400 --> 15:44.040
No, I, too! To Captain Poldark.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.400
How long do we stay
here in Cornwall?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.318
Until my business here is concluded.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.318
Why am I needed, Papa?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.598
I've got nothing to do with
that business.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.478
We have been strangers for much
of your life, my dear.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.360
I'm simply making up for lost time.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.918
Besides, I do have calls
to make today,

16:15.920 --> 16:17.920
of which I won't require
your presence.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.000
Shall we?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.638
Why did he wait so long?

16:23.640 --> 16:26.038
At first, we thought it
was a mistake.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.278
To be falsely accused, imprisoned
without trial?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.238
How could this be?

16:30.240 --> 16:34.918
Lately, it seems as if there
are dark forces at work.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.678
But Ned, he dislikes to ask
for aid or favour.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.720
I recall!

16:41.960 --> 16:48.558
So, if I'm not mistook, he asks me
to take on the government,

16:48.560 --> 16:53.918
the Crown, the Empire,
the slave trade.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.040
Did I omit anything?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.120
What is your view?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.558
That your mind is already made up.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.680
But you agree?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.877
Dear Lord, Ross.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.359
Why didn't I marry an ordinary man?

17:12.640 --> 17:13.680
When do we leave?

17:17.119 --> 17:23.798
May I present, Mr Ralph Hanson Of
the Mosquito Shore Mahogany Company?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.518
Mosquito Shore...?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.960
Bay of Honduras, sir.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.758
In the West Indies.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.000
Ah, of course.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.320
My daughter, Cecily.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.680
Charmed.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.160
How may I assist you, sir?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.398
So, will you resign your seat?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.640
I'm still in two minds.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.158
And meanwhile...

17:52.160 --> 17:54.638
..will you and the children join me?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.760
If I promise not to fight
anyone this time?

17:57.840 --> 18:00.398
And what would such a
promise be worth?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.758
Since you must always be battlin'
for some cause or other?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.158
-This latest...
-Is for a friend.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.800
Which makes it more or less
likely you'll fight?

18:14.680 --> 18:15.720
Morning!

18:18.040 --> 18:19.278
We need to eat...

18:19.280 --> 18:20.520
Get us some money.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.718
Plaguey Warleggans!

18:25.720 --> 18:27.438
Halved wages at Wheal Plenty.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.558
Six made complaint.
Every one dismissed.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.158
And now, they come to us for work.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.278
I tell them there's none,
they won't believe me.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.278
These folk will be persistent
when I'm gone.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.160
They need to know who
is in charge.

18:50.720 --> 18:55.238
As much as we wish to help,
we're a small concern.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.318
And can scarce find pitches for
those already employed.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.958
That don't mean we don't greatly
sympathise...

19:00.960 --> 19:02.600
That'll put bread in our mouths.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.918
But I will make enquiries
hereabouts,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.320
see what can be done for you.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.960
You have my word.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.958
Begging your pardon, mistress.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.918
It's a mistake to make promise.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.160
If anyone will hold you to it,
Tess Tregidden will.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.880
Well, I intend to honour my promise.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.158
In full.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.838
I understand you're to be
knighted next month.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.958
Must be gratifying to see
your efforts in parliament rewarded.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.720
Well, naturally, one does not
seek such honours.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.238
I myself am but a humble
man of business.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.598
Aye, but what a business!

19:54.600 --> 19:56.598
Mahogany!

19:56.600 --> 19:59.758
Worth its weight in gold, they say.

19:59.760 --> 20:04.518
Yes, and the beauty of it is, that
unlike gold, one can grow it -

20:04.520 --> 20:06.998
at very little cost to oneself.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.118
Though, at great cost to those
who labour for it.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.360
My daughter has a somewhat naive
grasp of business matters.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.718
When do you return to Westminster?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.158
I'm told your sway in the House
is considerable.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.238
Oh, I believe I have some
influence, yes.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.918
On the Irish Question,
where do you stand?

20:26.920 --> 20:30.438
On governance from Westminster, with
the firmest possible hand.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.958
Ah, now there, we agree.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.118
Heaven save me from upstart
Irishmen.

20:37.120 --> 20:42.720
In Honduras, I was plagued by a most
vexatious specimen.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.240
If the mahogany business interests
you, we should talk further.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.958
Perhaps you'd care to dine with us?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.678
Miss Cecily, too?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.838
Miss Cecily's returning to London.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.678
Really?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.358
For the season, Papa.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.480
I must have new gowns.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.318
Ah, well, in that case...

21:14.320 --> 21:15.758
A pity.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.800
Isn't it?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.000
The advantage must be obvious.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.920
A man in your position should
not remain single.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.838
May I introduce my battlefield
saviour -

21:50.840 --> 21:52.718
and your husband's most
esteemed surgeon -

21:52.720 --> 21:53.878
Dr Dwight Enys.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.238
Mrs Catherine Despard.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.638
I'm honoured to meet you, sir.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.078
The honour's entirely mine, ma'am.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.360
Knowing your husband, you're already
assured of my admiration.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.718
And you're certain it's wise to get
embroiled with Ned again?

22:09.720 --> 22:12.080
When was it ever wise to get
embroiled with Ned?

22:15.080 --> 22:16.318
Goodbye, my dear.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.478
Can't thank you enough for
lending me your husband.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.838
When you know my husband better,

22:19.840 --> 22:22.198
you'll discover he never does
what he don't want to!

22:22.200 --> 22:23.640
Nor mine! Vexing, is it not?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.920
-Take care of Mama for me.
-I will, Papa!

22:31.920 --> 22:33.278
Come see me soon.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.000
I promise I'll not stay a moment
longer than I need to.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.160
Come on.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.838
And He will come again, He will come
again in all his glory to judge

22:59.840 --> 23:05.838
both the living and the dead, and
His kingdom, it will have no end!

23:05.840 --> 23:07.198
No end!

23:07.200 --> 23:10.800
The Lord says that this is
the condemnation...

23:12.000 --> 23:17.120
His assaults upon our freedoms -
laws to stamp out free speech!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.440
On your feet, renegade.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.800
At ease, Ensign.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.558
And salute when you see a superior.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.800
When I see one, I will.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.438
That troublesome Irishman
I mentioned...

24:00.440 --> 24:02.598
Nailed the Spanish at Black River.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.678
Fought countless skirmishes all
the way to Honduras.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.798
Made governor of the new colony
at Mosquito Shore.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.080
As punishment or reward?

24:11.680 --> 24:15.198
Then tasked with allocating land
to the new colonists -

24:15.200 --> 24:17.120
convicts, pirates, deserters...

24:18.960 --> 24:20.838
..freed slaves.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.638
As much right as any to a
second chance.

24:23.640 --> 24:28.038
My colleagues - the old
colonists - occupied the land,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.478
and cut its timber, for generations.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.558
And although it wasn't
strictly theirs,

24:34.560 --> 24:37.358
-they felt they'd earned the right to call it so.
-Quite right.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.198
So, when that upstart began to hand
it out to every rag,

24:40.200 --> 24:45.198
tag and bobtail - well, he put our
entire business in jeopardy.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.758
Now, the Crown, takes a share
of the profits.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.958
So anything which threatens
the profits, is,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.318
ipso facto, an enemy of the Crown.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.920
Or so I argued, when I
denounced the man!

24:58.320 --> 24:59.798
So I'm recalled to London,

24:59.800 --> 25:02.558
accused of acting against the
interests of the Crown.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.998
By interfering with its profits.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.478
-You're a traitor.
-Guilty as charged.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.158
And have since lain, without trial,
in this delightful residence.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.318
Where he may contemplate
his mistakes...

25:14.320 --> 25:16.518
..at leisure.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.560
And you may continue to grow gold.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.440
My darling Kitty - she's without
means, without friends.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.560
Take her under your wing.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.358
She's a remarkable woman.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.520
I can see that, Ned.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.840
So, needless to say,
you have a plan?

25:43.920 --> 25:48.958
New laws to stamp out free speech
and forbid political meetings?

25:48.960 --> 25:51.998
And if the law forbids we now to
make complaint,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.918
can any be surprised, rather than
quelling the fire,

25:55.920 --> 25:58.118
it only adds fuel to it?

25:58.120 --> 26:01.720
Then, do we damn the law or take
it into our own hands?

26:04.720 --> 26:05.840
What have you in mind?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.798
Like they done in France.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.078
By teaching the "haves" what
it is to "have not"!

26:12.080 --> 26:14.838
By razing their fancy houses
to the ground!

26:14.840 --> 26:16.438
And how will that serve?

26:16.440 --> 26:18.080
It'll serve to make them afraid!

26:19.200 --> 26:22.040
Do we know of a better way to make
them sit up and take note?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.278
Steer well away from that one.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.798
But if the Lord commands
to save her...

26:36.800 --> 26:38.558
What, then?

26:38.560 --> 26:41.120
The greater the sinner,
the sweeter the victory.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.920
Papa, look what I found.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.798
Take it away.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.080
-But Papa...
-Take it away!

27:22.240 --> 27:23.520
Out alone, missis?

27:25.600 --> 27:27.840
Should you not be safe at home,
sippin' tea?

27:29.800 --> 27:33.318
I find I have little time
for such diversions.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.878
I have my work cut out with a farm,
a mine, a family.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.078
I know who you be.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.518
Scullery maid from Luggan
who wed her master.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.360
Got grand and forgot what it's
like to sicken and starve.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.318
No, I recollect well what it
means to go hungry.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.800
And I'd not wish it on anyone.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.720
Which is why it is my aim to find
honest work for you all.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.680
Bless thee, Lady Bountiful.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.080
Alms for the poor, to salve
thy conscience.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.240
What if we don't want charity?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.000
What do you want, then?

28:19.040 --> 28:20.080
Sister?

28:43.240 --> 28:44.558
What did they want?

28:44.560 --> 28:45.878
Er...

28:45.880 --> 28:48.518
They were just saying how
grateful they was

28:48.520 --> 28:50.680
that we're looking to find
work for them.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.398
Indeed, Captain, I was the
presiding magistrate

28:54.400 --> 28:56.960
when Despard was detained on
charges of sedition.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.798
Is he a friend of yours?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.958
We fought together in America.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.598
Knowing him as I do,

29:04.600 --> 29:07.638
I feel there's been a miscarriage
of justice.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.960
Unwitting, no doubt.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.678
Such things do happen.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.278
And I remember at the time speaking
in his favour.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.718
But the other magistrates
over-ruled me.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.598
What could be done to
secure his release?

29:21.600 --> 29:23.638
Or at least have the matter
come to trial?

29:23.640 --> 29:25.958
As there's no basis for
the accusations.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.198
-You know that for certain?
-Yes.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.598
And I intend to use what
influence I have

29:30.600 --> 29:32.158
to discover who falsely accused him.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.918
Influence?

29:33.920 --> 29:34.960
As an MP.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.400
You say Colonel Despard
feared a conspiracy?

29:44.080 --> 29:45.238
That's true.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.558
His Majesty's government - and
indeed the Crown itself -

29:47.560 --> 29:50.560
work in ways which we mere mortals
can scarce comprehend.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.000
But, erm...

29:54.880 --> 29:56.518
..let me see what can be done.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.160
I'm obliged to you, Mr Merceron.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.198
The girl would be an
excellent choice.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.240
Girl?

30:09.360 --> 30:11.358
Hanson's daughter.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.918
Prime breeding stock.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.200
Impressive fortune.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.998
Elizabeth should be here.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.040
What?

30:20.760 --> 30:21.920
Her portrait...

30:22.920 --> 30:25.040
..should not remain at Trenwith.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.438
I omitted to have it brought -
I must remedy that.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.518
Valentine would like to say
goodnight, sir.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.560
I wanted Opie to paint her again -
with Ursula and Valentine.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.200
George? Will you
not say goodnight to your son?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.518
Elizabeth?

30:42.520 --> 30:43.560
Sir?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.798
Thank you, Bessie.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.918
Goodnight, boy.

30:58.920 --> 30:59.960
Goodnight, Papa.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.960
-Goodnight, my love.
-Goodnight.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.280
Get off me.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.678
Is it usually this rowdy?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.638
-No.
-What's changed?

32:15.640 --> 32:17.238
London has changed.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.798
You mark it, too?

32:18.800 --> 32:22.038
When Kitty first spoke
of conspiracy,

32:22.040 --> 32:23.520
I thought she was mistook.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.878
There's a strange mood
abroad - an edge.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.318
I sometimes wonder who
can be trusted.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.278
God and the King?

32:34.280 --> 32:35.958
They do say the King's an ass.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.158
Ned would doubtless agree.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.798
How did you find him?

32:39.800 --> 32:41.078
Does he bear up well?

32:41.080 --> 32:43.198
Remarkably so, considering...

32:43.200 --> 32:45.878
Considering he has the temperament
of a powder keg?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.478
When we first knew him he was...

32:47.480 --> 32:49.638
Headstrong? Reckless?

32:49.640 --> 32:52.478
..impatient to right the
wrongs of the world.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.518
By whatever means.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.720
I think you'll find he's
older and wiser now.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.400
Shall you attend this?

33:17.880 --> 33:20.878
Your presence would add much
to the proceedings.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.358
Your own account, as told
from the heart.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.040
A heart which is much afflicted.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.398
The sure remedy for a sore
heart is a mission.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.440
Always.

34:29.679 --> 34:34.199
Sh, Garrick.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.398
Perhaps I was mistook -
though Garrick did bark.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.318
but 'twas more likely a dream.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.757
Maybe not.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.558
Two panes were broke last
night at Werry House.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.038
And some at Mingoose Lodge.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.398
I be thinking, maybe I should
heed Geoffrey Charles

34:54.400 --> 34:56.318
and stay over some nights
at Trenwith?

34:56.320 --> 34:59.880
And maybe I'll come stay with thee,
sister, till the ructions be abated.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.518
No. I can take care of myself.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.160
Besides, I have a remedy.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.120
Tess.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.720
I'm in need of a farm-hand.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.400
What's the catch?

35:28.240 --> 35:30.360
There's no catch.
Why would there be?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.238
Tess.

35:39.240 --> 35:43.160
You and I come of common stock,
and share a common hope, I think.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.080
To see better times ahead.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.480
Tomorrow, then.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.040
That'd be most convenient.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.158
Remind me to buy some ribbons,

36:18.160 --> 36:21.680
so my father will think we have been
about suitably girlish pursuits!

36:28.680 --> 36:30.278
Are we abolitionists now?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.598
As it happens, yes.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.478
But our presence today is in
support of Mrs Despard.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.758
Will it take long?

36:35.760 --> 36:37.398
Are we keeping
you from your drinking?

36:37.400 --> 36:39.038
I drink to forget.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.998
I'm still no nearer to funding
my studies.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.320
Nor will you be, if you swill what
little you have down your throat.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.438
I understand the speaker's
a former slave,

37:11.440 --> 37:14.158
-from Honduras.
-Hideous place.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.200
You know it?

37:17.280 --> 37:19.318
I lived there till I was ten.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.120
Then my mother caught a fever,
so we returned to London.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.920
Frankly, I'd sooner die than
set foot there again.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.640
The accounts of the Mosquito
Shore Mahogany Company.

37:38.160 --> 37:42.200
As you will see, the yield
is considerable.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.238
Ah, my dear, would you favour us
with your opinion?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.438
Let me introduce you to Mr Hanson.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.638
May I present...

37:50.640 --> 37:55.078
Nephew, does Bessie need to be
involved with our discussions?

37:55.080 --> 37:57.078
She must always be consulted.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.998
It's a personal rule of mine.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.480
I'm sure you'll understand.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.078
Mr Hanson, would you permit us

38:05.080 --> 38:08.238
to look over these accounts
for a few days?

38:08.240 --> 38:09.600
There is much to consider.

38:11.920 --> 38:12.960
Yes, of course.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.680
By all means.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.640
Pack for Trenwith.

38:29.800 --> 38:36.078
Ask yourselves - what is it that
corrupts the milk of human kindness,

38:36.080 --> 38:41.398
turns the just and tender-hearted
into vile, rapacious brutes?

38:41.400 --> 38:46.238
It is the single-minded
pursuit of profit.

38:49.520 --> 38:52.078
How long can this continue?

38:52.080 --> 38:59.880
Do not our senses cry out for
liberty, equality, brotherhood?

39:03.120 --> 39:05.518
-Most eloquent.
-And dangerous.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.518
They'll be calling her
a Jacobin next.

39:07.520 --> 39:12.478
Before my husband freed me,
first, he bought me.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.718
Was I a piece of meat?

39:14.720 --> 39:16.758
Chattel to be traded?

39:16.760 --> 39:21.598
An object without sense or humanity?

39:21.600 --> 39:26.998
My former master thought so,
used me viciously.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.518
But my husband taught me that
if we truly seek a better world,

39:32.520 --> 39:35.478
we should not wait for the
life hereafter,

39:35.480 --> 39:38.200
we should build it.
here on Earth!

39:39.960 --> 39:41.280
And how do we do that?

39:43.240 --> 39:45.318
-How?
-Be quiet.

39:45.320 --> 39:48.398
By preparing for the second
coming of our Lord!

39:48.400 --> 39:51.118
-Oh, leave it out!
-Let him speak!

39:51.120 --> 39:53.998
Do we not hope for a time
when all voices can be heard,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.240
and none suppressed?

40:00.880 --> 40:02.958
Well, my friends...

40:02.960 --> 40:05.680
-A force to be reckoned with.
-..let us all ask ourselves...

40:20.040 --> 40:21.320
How peaceful it is!

40:29.320 --> 40:31.560
-Don't touch me.
-Forgive me.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.600
Forgive me.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.680
Will I light us a fire?

41:09.440 --> 41:11.920
So, you're actually
acquainted with her?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.400
Would you like me to introduce you?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.958
Yes, she is quite the firebrand.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.000
-Like her husband.
-Indeed.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.878
Forgive me, Ross.
I must ask you again -

41:30.880 --> 41:33.318
is it wise to embroil
yourself with Ned?

41:33.320 --> 41:35.038
He's always been a law unto himself.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.118
And has clearly acquired
powerful enemies.

41:37.120 --> 41:41.038
When dealing with such enemies, one
must have something to bargain with.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.480
-What have you?
-Nothing.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.998
Except the debt I owe to the
man who saved my life.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.438
Colley Cibber's play's
at Drury Lane.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.198
The King has seen it four times.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.840
-Has he?
-I propose we all go tonight.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.560
By all means.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.320
Is that...?

42:30.840 --> 42:31.880
That's Valentine.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.200
Valentine.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.560
How came you here?

42:51.440 --> 42:54.358
Are you not now lodged in Truro?

42:54.360 --> 42:55.400
Hm?

42:57.360 --> 42:59.278
-Shall I take you home to your father?
-No.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.480
Master Valentine!

43:06.080 --> 43:07.480
Which is worse?

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
Burying a child or leaving
one behind?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.440
She did not deserve her fate.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.080
Nor did her children.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.960
I never meant to affright thee.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.840
You think I did not know that?

43:50.840 --> 43:55.560
Oh, Drake, you are the kindest,
most patient of men.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.000
When we married...

44:03.400 --> 44:04.440
..I thought...

44:08.040 --> 44:09.080
..hoped...

44:10.360 --> 44:12.958
..that I could be a proper
wife to you.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.160
You are a proper wife.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.758
Waking, yes.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.040
Yet, abed...

44:22.120 --> 44:23.440
..I cannot...

44:26.760 --> 44:28.478
..I cannot bring myself...

44:28.480 --> 44:30.240
I cannot.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.600
And it is cruel to so deprive you.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.318
I am not deprived.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.360
I should like...

44:40.040 --> 44:42.038
..one day...

44:42.040 --> 44:45.318
..to be a wife to you in every way.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.040
That day may come.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.200
Or not.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.720
It will make no difference
to my love.

45:13.720 --> 45:14.918
You heard the news?

45:14.920 --> 45:17.278
An assassination attempt on the
King today at Hyde Park.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.838
Attempt? So, it failed?

45:18.840 --> 45:20.678
-Was he caught?
-Apparently.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.838
Do you know the identity of
the would-be assassin?

45:22.840 --> 45:25.518
No, but a fellow standing close by
declared that had the shot

45:25.520 --> 45:28.438
been two inches higher, it would
have been mortal.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.958
Damn him! Twas not his destiny.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.758
He had no right! Nay, nay.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.400
But mine is the sacrifice.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.838
Now, I must offer myself up
to be executed

45:40.840 --> 45:42.680
for ridding the world of the Tyrant.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.478
And what of the play?

45:45.480 --> 45:47.918
Do we think it is comical
or tragical?

45:47.920 --> 45:50.758
The anti-Christ who wears the crown.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.838
Don't we all come to watch
the audience?

45:52.840 --> 45:55.478
-You speak for yourself, I assume.
-Of course.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.520
Miss Hanson.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.640
He needs tonight to be a public
show of defiance.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.118
You?

46:37.120 --> 46:40.798
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!

46:40.800 --> 46:43.478
It's George. It's George.

46:43.480 --> 46:46.918
Drake Carne was here, in this room!
I want him thrashed!

46:46.920 --> 46:49.798
-I want him shot!
-And he will be, rest assured.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.838
He was here, as close to me
as you are now!

46:52.840 --> 46:54.160
Of course he was.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.158
Thank you, my brother.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.718
Now, it would take but
a second as he struts and...

47:02.880 --> 47:05.638
-Shall we take our seats?
-I'll join you directly.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.480
There's something I must attend to.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.078
Any news?

47:26.080 --> 47:27.238
Nothing yet..

47:27.240 --> 47:29.560
Sir.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.638
Excuse me.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.720
Pardon me.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.000
Excuse me, sir.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.438
Prudie!

48:25.440 --> 48:26.878
Prudie, There's a fire!

48:26.880 --> 48:28.720
There's a fire! Get out, Prudie!

48:32.120 --> 48:34.000
Wake up!

48:35.640 --> 48:37.118
What's happening?

48:37.120 --> 48:38.398
Here.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.440
Hold these over your faces.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.920
Ladies and Gentlemen, please rise
for His Majesty, The King!

48:51.800 --> 48:54.600
# God save our gracious...

48:58.440 --> 49:02.760
# Long live our noble King...

49:10.320 --> 49:13.600
# Send him victorious...

49:19.840 --> 49:21.600
# Happy and glorious... #

49:36.320 --> 49:37.758
In the hand of God beholden!

49:37.760 --> 49:39.480
The lamb who rids the world of sin.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.560
You're safe now, my darlings.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.278
I am the light...

49:46.280 --> 49:47.878
I am the light.

49:47.880 --> 49:51.638
Behold the lamb who takes away
the sins of the world.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.200
Behold the Messiah...

49:54.640 --> 49:57.000
-Kitty.
-Thank you.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.638
God save the King!

50:01.640 --> 50:04.958
In case you were wondering,
that wasn't the prologue.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.238
What?

50:06.240 --> 50:07.280
No encore?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.598
How disappointing.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.998
The man's aim was a disgrace.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.960
And the King's performance
very undramatic.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.520
My name is Wickham.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.360
Perhaps you've heard of me.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.560
Should I?

50:40.280 --> 50:42.518
It's my business to be aware
of persons who may

50:42.520 --> 50:43.798
be of interest to the Crown -

50:43.800 --> 50:46.360
either by rendering it assistance,
or the reverse.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.758
How did you come to know of the
assassination attempt?

50:51.760 --> 50:53.318
Which?

50:53.320 --> 50:55.118
I believe there were two today.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.160
The latter.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.038
By a fortunate coincidence,
I arrived at the theatre in time

51:01.040 --> 51:02.440
to do His Majesty a service.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.480
But to be frank, it's been
a tiresome disruption.

51:08.160 --> 51:11.358
I hope I may now be permitted
to join my friends.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.480
Is Catherine Despard your friend?

51:16.120 --> 51:17.838
Her husband is.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.838
On whose account she appealed
to me for assistance.

51:20.840 --> 51:21.880
Regarding?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.078
His imprisonment on false charges.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.960
These are difficult times, Captain.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.480
It's wise to be...selective.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.038
Of...?

51:35.040 --> 51:37.478
Those with whom one aligns oneself.

51:37.480 --> 51:39.638
Ned Despard, for instance,

51:39.640 --> 51:44.118
made some unwise connections during
his time in the West Indies.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.878
And there was he thinking he was
improving the lot of the common man.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.518
And you're quite sure you know
where your loyalties lie?

51:49.520 --> 51:52.920
I'd suggest that was perfectly clear
from my actions this evening.

51:57.840 --> 52:01.120
You have indeed rendered the Crown
invaluable service tonight.

52:03.080 --> 52:05.040
And it may have further use of you.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.360
What manner of use?

52:10.520 --> 52:12.838
His Majesty's government
can always find a covert role

52:12.840 --> 52:15.760
for a person of your...talents.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.080
If...

52:24.240 --> 52:27.198
..I were willing to consider
such a role,

52:27.200 --> 52:29.880
what might the government be
willing to do in return?

52:31.760 --> 52:33.000
Have a care, Captain.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.398
It would be reckless to
overplay your hand

52:37.400 --> 52:39.480
so early in our acquaintance.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.600
Did I miss anything?

53:02.960 --> 53:05.878
Could someone have left
a candle burning?

53:05.880 --> 53:07.718
Don't you give me squinny-eye, maid!

53:07.720 --> 53:10.318
It was deliberate, and no mistake!

53:10.320 --> 53:12.478
But who'd do such a thing?

53:12.480 --> 53:13.840
That, we'd all like to know.

53:15.440 --> 53:16.480
Tess.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.478
You pair could fettle this.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.798
If you work for me, there
must be trust.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.958
Each to the other. You understand?

53:25.960 --> 53:27.000
I understand.

53:28.760 --> 53:29.800
Did you do this?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.800
I did not.

53:51.040 --> 53:53.478
I take it you won't be
resigning your seat

53:53.480 --> 53:56.720
if by retaining it, you can render
a different kind of service?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.838
You understand what's
being asked of me?

54:01.840 --> 54:04.038
I understand what covert means.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.318
I also recall how you sprang me from
Quimper without a second thought.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.598
That was different.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.118
You were my friend. Is Wickham?

54:10.120 --> 54:13.238
Still, the role may give you scope
to serve those causes

54:13.240 --> 54:14.280
close to your heart.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.040
You're free to go.

54:30.760 --> 54:34.598
We should make arrangements for your
departure to London.

54:34.600 --> 54:35.720
For what purpose?

54:38.240 --> 54:40.078
Your investiture.

54:40.080 --> 54:42.400
At St James's, by the King himself.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.358
Ah, yes.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.400
Of course.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.080
I'll remind Elizabeth.
It must have slipped her mind.

54:52.520 --> 54:55.440
Elizabeth's already there,
awaiting us.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.560
Are you quite sane, uncle?
Elizabeth is here.

55:15.800 --> 55:17.480
Oh, my love...

55:25.320 --> 55:26.958
How the hell did you manage it?

55:26.960 --> 55:28.120
I'm not entirely sure.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.958
I'm glad to be of service.
But now...

55:31.960 --> 55:33.918
What do you recommend?
A quiet life?

55:33.920 --> 55:35.598
My head down and my mouth shut?

55:35.600 --> 55:37.438
-Yes!
-Well...
-Oh, I could do.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.998
And so could you. Behave ourselves.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.198
Not attempt to clear my name.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.878
Ignore the rank corruption which put
me here in the first place.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.518
But...?

55:47.520 --> 55:50.238
Where would be the fun in that?

55:50.240 --> 55:51.480
Come on!

55:53.480 --> 55:55.718
Ain't fair, ain't right.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.078
Should be I in that carriage,
going to London.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.078
Instead of which, it's left to me
to make the house fitty again.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.478
Have I not said?

56:02.480 --> 56:05.118
With all these goings-on,
fires and the like,

56:05.120 --> 56:07.398
how could I rest easy
without you here?

56:07.400 --> 56:10.038
Indeed, who'd be a common
ladies maid...?

56:10.040 --> 56:12.640
When they could be Queen of Nampara?

56:13.840 --> 56:15.080
Queen of Nampara?

56:19.520 --> 56:21.880
Bye. Safe travel.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.918
Here he is - the root of all evil!

57:09.920 --> 57:11.078
The Devil Incarnate.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.318
I'd take a strap to thee,
were our mistress here.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.998
-Thee? Mistress, here?
-Stranger things have happened.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.118
I have come to consider insanity
not as a moral failing,

57:19.120 --> 57:21.678
but an affliction which may
happen to the best of us.

57:21.680 --> 57:22.918
You won't tell on us?

57:22.920 --> 57:24.558
In truth, I feel a little uneasy.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.280
I care not what my father thinks.

57:27.760 --> 57:29.318
I will uncover your accomplices!

57:29.320 --> 57:31.198
Rest assured, you will
be made to pay!

57:31.200 --> 57:34.038
This conspiracy has robbed me
of my name and position

57:34.040 --> 57:35.320
and I want them restored!
