WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.421
- Yeah, they didn't have these
3D puzzles when I was a kid.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.132
Now we can have
our own Empire State Building.

00:07.215 --> 00:10.218
- Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

00:10.301 --> 00:13.263
But it's missing something.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.434
- For the 97th time,
we're not getting a monkey.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.602
Oh, look, honey, we've been
working on this all day.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.187
I bet we'll be done tomorrow.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.314
- Oh, great.
We get our dinner table back.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.109
There's a new casserole
I wanna try making tonight.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.611
- On second thought,
maybe we need one more day

00:28.695 --> 00:31.614
just to have--you know,
just one--one more day.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.991
- Yeah.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.285
- Hi, hi, hi.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.788
No, no, no.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.290
Get that thing away from me.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.291
- What is wrong with you?

00:41.374 --> 00:44.377
It's a puzzle,
not a bucket of water.

00:44.461 --> 00:44.961
- Puzzles are evil.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.880
They bring bad luck.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.966
- Bad--what kind of backwoods
nonsense--you know what?

00:50.049 --> 00:51.342
We're not even
gonna go there with you.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
Right, buddy?

00:52.510 --> 00:53.678
- Right.

00:53.762 --> 00:57.140
Why are puzzles bad luck,
Grandma Maggie?

00:57.223 --> 00:59.476
- Well, let's start
with my Aunt Rose.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.020
A puzzle put her in the ground.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.315
- And you were
gonna make us miss this.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.151
- Mom, just because Aunt Rose
died doing a puzzle

01:08.234 --> 01:10.737
does not mean
some evil puzzle killed her.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.990
- Then how do you explain
the corner piece

01:14.073 --> 01:17.327
lodged in her esophagus?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.330
- They also found stuffing
from a couch cushion.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.665
- Exactly.

01:22.749 --> 01:27.670
That woman once ate her way
through a furniture showroom.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.007
Never had a problem.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.884
Puzzles.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.512
- [phone dings]

01:35.595 --> 01:37.388
- Oh, good. [laughing]

01:37.472 --> 01:40.016
My contract came in
from the Van Wright Sweet 16.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.852
I don't wanna be crass, but even
if I got paid in hundreds,

01:42.936 --> 01:46.022
I could still make it rain.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.607
- Sweet 16 for a rich kid?

01:47.690 --> 01:49.692
Mark my RSVP yes.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.530
I'll order the steak
with a side of sports car.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.031
- You're not invited.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.741
- But I bring all this.

01:59.118 --> 02:02.705
- Well, we'll muddle through
without all of that.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.707
- Come on, I've seen it on TV.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.252
Rich parents give out
crazy party favors.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.878
They think money is love.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.551
Speaking of which, Dad,
I'm not feeling the love.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.887
I could use about 20 loves.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.140
- I already gave
all my love to Gabby.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.392
- [laughing]

02:22.475 --> 02:24.769
- I cannot believe you said that
to the library lady.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.062
She hates you now.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.314
- Okay, hey, if you don't want
people thinking you're pregnant,

02:28.398 --> 02:29.649
don't be rocking a muumuu.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.901
- Right. [laughs]

02:31.985 --> 02:32.902
Oh, hey, everybody.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.197
- Uh...hi.
- Noah!

02:36.281 --> 02:37.574
You guys are back together?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.075
I missed you.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.828
- No, no, no,
we're still broken up.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.330
- Oh, then this is
a little awkward. Uh...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.042
Yeah.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.962
That's a good color on you.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.589
Now what's this all about?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.924
- Just a friend
lending a friend a book.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.259
- Thank you, friend.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.468
I'll see you at school.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.845
Bye, everyone.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.805
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.390
- Okay, I'm gonna
go do homework.

03:02.473 --> 03:06.352
- Uh, hold on.
We need to talk about this.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
- Uh-oh.
- Relationship talk.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.731
- Run for it.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.860
- Uhh.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.779
Friends with an ex?
Don't go there.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.282
- We already went there.
It's been nice.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.993
- Yeah, but it doesn't work
when you're in high school.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.369
You start out as friends.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.538
But someone always ends up
following someone to college

03:25.622 --> 03:26.789

{\an8}- Rick Mooch.

a little bad news.

put a dolphin in the pool.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.772

to the show last weekend,

had a recital.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.281
- Well, we should be going.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.616
- Stephanie,
email us the budget.

are doing a secret show tonight.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.455
Wanna go?

05:30.538 --> 05:31.456
- Do you think we can get in?

05:31.539 --> 05:32.832
- Probably.

It's in our backyard. [laughs]

You must be the McRiches.

- The Van Wrights.

You know, a party is only
as good as its party favors.

You should go big.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.650
- Stop, Gabby.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.740
- That works, too.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.909
- [gasps]
Who let that Rick in here?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.369
- Security!

19:22.452 --> 19:23.912
- Honey, I can handle this.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.957
I'll wire $5,000
into your account

19:27.040 --> 19:29.710
if you never
see my daughter again.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.087
- Nice try.
You don't know my Rick.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.755
Right, Rick?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.090
Rick!

19:35.173 --> 19:38.427
Ah, man!

19:38.510 --> 19:39.428
- See, Steph!

19:39.511 --> 19:40.178
I told you I was right.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.598
You can be friends with an ex.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.974
- Uh-huh. That's exactly
what I wanna talk about

19:44.057 --> 19:47.895
at the biggest party
of my career.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.605
I've gotta damage control
the McRiches.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.690
Get this red, hot mess
out of my way.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.696
- You really were
looking out for me.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.240
- That's what friends do.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.992
- Tell me the truth.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.953
You haven't thought
about you and me at all?

20:05.037 --> 20:05.871
- Nope.

20:05.954 --> 20:09.041
- Good,
because you're a lot of work.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.293
- If that's settled,
help me find my tail.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.463
This thing's a rental.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.631
- I am so sorry.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.799
I hope this doesn't affect
our business relationship.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.718
- Not at all.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.094
You gave a wonderful party.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.681
But I am going to have to deduct
what the octopus took.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.141
- Take your time, Steph.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.018
I gotta make two trips.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.275
