you hurt each other!

00:17.241 --> 00:21.724
[laughs] Sorry, all I heard was,
"Hurt each other."

00:21.827 --> 00:25.000
- [chuckles] I have a very
special quest for you.

00:25.103 --> 00:27.241
This week, you must retrieve
an ancient medallion

00:27.344 --> 00:29.896
from the hidden garden
of gnomes.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.103
- Medallions are great.

00:33.206 --> 00:36.206
- And these really
make our eyes pop.

00:36.310 --> 00:37.827
- I wish my eyes would pop

00:37.931 --> 00:39.689
so I don't have
to see that anymore.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.551
- Now, this medallion
has the power to turn people

00:44.655 --> 00:46.758
into stone garden gnomes.

00:46.862 --> 00:48.275
- Cute, but scary.

00:48.379 --> 00:52.137
- Aww, cute but scary,
just like my Sage.

00:52.241 --> 00:54.620
- I was going for terrifying,
but I'll take it.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.241
- But the real lesson
is learning

00:57.344 --> 00:59.689
how to work with each other,
so I'm forming two groups.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.862
Kripan, Lucky,
you will be with Unicorn Squad.

01:02.965 --> 01:05.310
Sage, Buttercup,
you will be with--

01:05.413 --> 01:07.620
- Wolverine Squad.
- Wolverine Squad.

01:09.655 --> 01:11.103
I meant Phoenix Squad.

01:11.206 --> 01:12.655
- We can't work with them!

01:12.758 --> 01:14.655
- And we don't wanna
work with them!

01:14.758 --> 01:17.275
- Oh, see? You're already
on the same page.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.689
- Please don't put Sage
in our group.

01:20.793 --> 01:23.655
She's always trying
to sabotage us, she's--

01:23.758 --> 01:25.827
How can I put this nicely?

01:25.931 --> 01:29.448
- A Meanie McMeaniepants!
I'm so sorry for cursing.

01:31.172 --> 01:33.413
- Well, a wise knight once said,

01:33.517 --> 01:36.758
"Working with your rivals
is the key to survival."

01:36.862 --> 01:39.206
And that wise knight was me.

01:39.310 --> 01:42.448
- Hmmm, I read that
in a fortune cookie once.

01:42.551 --> 01:44.965
- Couldn't just let me have it,
could you?

01:45.068 --> 01:48.379
Now, the point is whoever
refuses to work with each other

01:48.482 --> 01:50.827
will spend the day
in my detention cave.

01:50.931 --> 01:53.310
- [magic zapping]

01:53.413 --> 01:57.758

my initials carved in it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.827
- Yes. You spend
so much time in there,

02:00.931 --> 02:03.655

02:08.793 --> 02:10.103
- We're not dumb-dumbs.

02:10.206 --> 02:12.000
That's not what the backs
of your shirts say.

02:12.103 --> 02:13.137
- What?

02:15.931 --> 02:17.517
- "I'm a dumb-dumb."

02:17.620 --> 02:18.758
- Ha! I agree.

02:20.103 --> 02:21.896
I wanted to dangle you
off a cliff,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.275
but Buttercup stopped me.

02:23.379 --> 02:25.172
- I didn't want anyone
to get hurt.

02:25.275 --> 02:28.103
- So I settled for hurting
your feelings instead.

02:28.206 --> 02:30.241
- [crying] Well, it worked!

02:33.931 --> 02:36.793
- How are we supposed
to survive this quest with Sage?

02:36.896 --> 02:39.344
- Oh, we could insult each other
like Sage would,

02:39.448 --> 02:42.413
so when she does,
it doesn't hurt our feelings.

02:42.517 --> 02:43.793
Start with me.
- You walk weird.

02:43.896 --> 02:45.758
- Your bow's too big.
- You have beady eyes.

02:45.862 --> 02:47.413
- Too mean!

02:49.068 --> 02:50.827
- Wait, I have a better plan.

02:50.931 --> 02:52.448
Sage has a really bad attitude,

02:52.551 --> 02:55.137
so all she needs
is an attitude adjustment.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.241
- Oh, I hear ya loud and clear.

02:59.655 --> 03:04.655
- Um, no, we give her
an attitude adjust-mint.

03:04.758 --> 03:07.379
It's a magical breath spray
that changes a person's attitude

03:07.482 --> 03:10.206
to the complete opposite.
- Oh, good idea.

03:10.310 --> 03:12.827
Yeah, my mom tried to use that
spray to make me less charming,

03:12.931 --> 03:16.379
but, uh...she never got me.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.275
