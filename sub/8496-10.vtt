00:02.500 --> 00:05.033
Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:05.100 --> 00:06.767
It's Raquel.

00:06.833 --> 00:07.933
She's dying.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.233
What's your deepest
secret, Jelena?

00:10.300 --> 00:11.967
I'm terrified of
being alone.

00:13.433 --> 00:14.567
She's gone.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.800
I do want kids...
with you.

00:17.867 --> 00:21.667
It's unlikely you'll ever
be able to have a child.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.100
The only thing I can
trust is my heart.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.367
It's always
been yours.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.033
You have a sister?

00:28.100 --> 00:30.000
There's this private
investigator I use.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.267
Maybe he can
help you find her.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.467
What are you
doing here?
I found her.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.933
We want to buy
the Devils.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.867
Agree to trade Derek
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.633
How the hell did Derek
find out about our deal?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.000
Payback's a bitch.

00:41.067 --> 00:43.300
I'll want you to
sell me the arena.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.433
We're all for a truce,

00:45.500 --> 00:47.533
but not at the expense
of the arena.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.800
I'm not afraid of Oscar.

00:50.067 --> 00:51.567
Thank you for
taking care of

00:51.633 --> 00:54.633
what I asked you
to take care of.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.000
I would do anything
for you, Sloane Hayes.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.700
You try one more thing
with Sloane

01:00.767 --> 01:02.333
and you won't make
it to your own trial!

01:02.400 --> 01:03.533
What are you gonna do?

01:04.700 --> 01:06.500
I'm gonna kill
Sloane Hayes.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.800
I can't believe Raquel
is really gone.

01:34.367 --> 01:35.367
And German's gone.

01:37.533 --> 01:38.667
It's all just
so...

01:39.767 --> 01:41.200
I know.

01:47.533 --> 01:48.667
Mandi.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.433
Who's that?

01:55.500 --> 01:56.700
She works for
my lawyer.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.333
I'm gonna
take a shower.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.733
You wanna join?

02:17.533 --> 02:18.667
I saw them.

02:19.733 --> 02:20.667
Saw who?

02:20.733 --> 02:22.667
Not who, what.

02:22.733 --> 02:26.067
Your birth-control pills
in the trash.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.400
Mmm...

02:31.100 --> 02:32.333
I can't have children.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.367
What?

02:37.433 --> 02:38.667
I took the tests.

02:40.633 --> 02:41.767
I...

02:44.067 --> 02:45.367
Terrence, I'm sorry.

02:48.667 --> 02:49.900
What are you doing?

02:51.467 --> 02:52.967
What do you mean
what am I doing?

02:53.067 --> 02:55.467
This, telling me
you can't have children?

02:55.533 --> 02:56.700
Jelena...

02:56.767 --> 02:58.067
Terrence?

02:58.100 --> 03:00.200
First, you said you
didn't have time for kids

03:00.267 --> 03:01.933
outside the nursery
at the hospital.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.267
That didn't work,
so now this?

03:06.067 --> 03:07.333
You think
I'm lying to you?

03:07.400 --> 03:10.200
I think you changed your
mind about having kids.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.833
You know how much I want
them and you're panicking.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.367
I can't believe after
everything

03:19.433 --> 03:20.500
we've been through,

03:20.567 --> 03:22.167
you think I'd do
something like this.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.900
And I can't believe
after everything

03:23.967 --> 03:26.133
we've been through,
you'd think you'd have to.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.133
Sit down.

03:49.967 --> 03:52.333
You've got three months
to prove your loyalty,

03:52.400 --> 03:53.800
or you're out.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.667
You want me to keep
working for the Devils?

03:55.733 --> 03:57.200
For you?

03:57.267 --> 03:59.067
You're about to get the
education of your life.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.133
Keep your eyes open.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.300
You'll see how real
business gets done.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.367
I'm gonna go order that
personnel change.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.333
Don't hold dinner.

04:21.467 --> 04:22.400
Personnel change?

04:23.867 --> 04:25.100
As mad
as he is at us,

04:25.167 --> 04:26.800
there's someone he's
even madder at.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.100
He's mad at me?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.967
He has a funny way
of showing it.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.067
He offered to keep me
on with the Devils,

04:32.067 --> 04:34.267
work for him.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.767
You have a choice.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.467
That's great.

04:37.533 --> 04:38.933
Meanwhile, I'm screwed.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.133
Literally.

04:42.267 --> 04:44.067
Your dad promised me
in no uncertain terms

04:44.100 --> 04:46.933
that not only will
I stay his wife,

04:47.067 --> 04:48.500
I'll be his
wife in every way.

04:50.733 --> 04:52.300
I made this bed.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.067
All the things I've done
these past months.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.467
But there's still
something I can do.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.067
Something that might
just keep me

05:02.133 --> 05:03.567
from going
straight to hell.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.467
Anything with "Miguel" on it
is going to Jesse's.

05:17.833 --> 05:18.967
Where is that going?

05:20.067 --> 05:21.433
I'm keeping it.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.933
I may be the world's
worst girlfriend,

05:23.067 --> 05:24.233
but I was
a damn good wife.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.067
Spill it.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.700
I just had a weird moment
with Derek this morning.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.067
Girl called,
he wouldn't answer.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.200
He said she worked
for his lawyer,

05:36.267 --> 05:38.933
but the way
he was acting...

05:39.067 --> 05:40.867
Maybe it was a groupie
from his past.

05:40.933 --> 05:42.733
He would have
said that then.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.100
He's Derek.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.567
I can't tell if that's
a pro statement

05:45.633 --> 05:46.633
or a con statement.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.300
It's a chillax statement.

05:48.367 --> 05:50.600
You can't freak out every
time his cell goes off.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.900
Keep it together.

06:00.733 --> 06:01.667
It's an e-mail.

06:01.733 --> 06:02.667
From who?

06:03.933 --> 06:05.300
Raquel.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.900
Your investigator got me
more info on my sister.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.067
She's been
living with a family in

06:17.133 --> 06:18.400
Hyde Park, Massachusetts.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.067
She's in her senior year
at BU.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.367
She drives a hybrid.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.700
He got me her number,
I'm gonna call her

06:22.767 --> 06:23.800
after the game tonight.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.067
That's awesome.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.633
I'll be there working.

06:30.567 --> 06:31.500
Working?

06:33.067 --> 06:35.667
Oscar offered to
keep me on.

06:37.233 --> 06:39.267
You want to
work for Oscar?

06:39.333 --> 06:40.900
Lionel's in trouble.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.467
I need to look out
for her.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.067
And?

06:44.067 --> 06:46.767
And... it's only
a matter of time

06:46.833 --> 06:48.333
before Oscar
self-destructs,

06:48.400 --> 06:51.667
and when he does, I'm gonna
be there to take over.

07:04.733 --> 07:05.767
What's this?

07:05.833 --> 07:07.367
Lab work.

07:07.433 --> 07:10.100
My OB-GYN's name is
Dr. Cutler.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.333
She's on Beverly Drive

07:11.400 --> 07:13.167
and her phone number's
on every page.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.233
I should have
believed you.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.500
But you didn't.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.167
You still don't.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.433
Look at you
with those papers.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.167
You want to look
so badly.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.767
The minute I leave,
you will.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.367
Jelena...

07:29.433 --> 07:31.567
you made me
fail a drug test.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.200
You almost ruined
my career.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.467
I thought we
worked through that.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.533
I thought I made
that right.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.400
You did.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.533
I'm not mad at you.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.667
I love you.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.067
You just don't
trust me.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.300
We have
everything else.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.433
Maybe we don't
need trust.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.267
I know who you are.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.333
And I accept it.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.133
Raquel?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.067
It was sent from her
e-mail account.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.733
She timed it
to be sent today.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.067
What did it say?

08:21.133 --> 08:22.900
It had a guy's name
and number in it.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.100
Kyle's going to
meet up with him.

08:32.867 --> 08:34.067
Lionel?

08:34.100 --> 08:35.333
What the hell are
you doing here?

08:35.400 --> 08:36.700
Buying back some karma.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.900
Oscar's on
the warpath for you.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.300
What else is new?

08:41.367 --> 08:43.200
He said he's gonna
have you killed.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.400
New enough for you?

08:46.367 --> 08:48.133
He just...
told you that?

08:48.200 --> 08:50.400
I think he thought it
would be an aphrodisiac.

08:51.733 --> 08:53.367
I am many things,

08:53.433 --> 08:55.433
but an accomplice to
murder isn't one of them.

08:56.933 --> 08:58.133
Watch your back.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.600
All right, that's it,
I'm calling the police.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.600
I still have your
gun in my desk.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.333
You have a gun?

09:08.400 --> 09:10.100
If Jelena just
stayed out of this--

09:10.167 --> 09:11.733
What does Jelena
have to do with this?

09:13.067 --> 09:15.733
She stole my evidence
and gave it to Lionel.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.500
I'm here because of her.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.633
How did you
get past security?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.067
I told them I wanted to
kick your ass

09:30.100 --> 09:31.400
and they
waved me through.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.133
You're a disaster.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.133
Anything bad that
happens starts with you.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.333
Oscar's threatening
my mom's life

09:41.400 --> 09:43.300
and it's all your fault.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.200
Your mother decided
to make Oscar

09:45.267 --> 09:47.567
her little pet project,

09:47.633 --> 09:49.267
not me.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.400
Now, if this crazy train is
ready to leave the station--

09:54.467 --> 09:56.067
Do I have your
attention now?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.333
I clearly have yours.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.667
What have I done
to you, Ahsha Hayes?

10:05.033 --> 10:06.167
One more little push

10:06.233 --> 10:08.133
and you are
over the edge.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.400
Hate isn't strong enough
for what I feel for you,

10:18.467 --> 10:20.400
you power-grubbing bitch.

10:21.467 --> 10:22.700
You wanna talk
power-grubbing?

10:24.367 --> 10:27.300
How about your move to
be made captain, hmm?

10:28.533 --> 10:31.133
Captain of
the Devil Girls,

10:31.200 --> 10:34.067
dating the captain of
the Devils...

10:34.133 --> 10:36.067
all-star.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.267
Sound familiar?

10:38.367 --> 10:40.333
Deny it all
you want.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.600
I'm still
your role model.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.300
Hate me?

10:44.367 --> 10:46.267
You wanna be me.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.733
I'm over your
mind games.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.700
You made a mess,
you're gonna fix it.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.667
And if you don't,

10:54.733 --> 10:56.600
you'll see how much
I can be like you.

11:11.067 --> 11:11.967
Sloane.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.467
What a surprise.

11:14.533 --> 11:15.833
Save it.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.333
You've made
my life hell.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.333
Now you're out of jail

11:19.400 --> 11:21.433
and all you
want is revenge.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.300
And I'll get it.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.533
In due time.

11:25.633 --> 11:26.933
Your time is now.

11:28.767 --> 11:31.500
You had someone else do
your dirty work with Mia.

11:31.567 --> 11:34.367
You have people do your
dirty work for everything.

11:34.433 --> 11:35.467
Are you man enough to
kill me

11:35.533 --> 11:36.667
with your
own two hands?

11:39.167 --> 11:40.700
Here I am.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.933
Do it.

11:42.067 --> 11:42.933
Kill me.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.100
Or don't you
have the guts?

11:49.267 --> 11:50.800
Never a dull moment
around here.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.967
Now is not
a good time, Jelena.

11:54.067 --> 11:56.133
It's been brought
to my attention by

11:56.200 --> 11:57.900
a certain B-league
Devil Girl

11:57.967 --> 12:00.233
that there might
be a situation brewing.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.067
I came to fix it.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.667
Fix it?

12:08.367 --> 12:09.700
I'll make you
a deal.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.233
Leave Sloane alone
and...

12:14.700 --> 12:16.167
... you can
have the arena.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.300
Such a selfless act
for someone you dislike

12:21.367 --> 12:22.767
almost as much
as I do.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.867
Hardly selfless.

12:25.933 --> 12:29.433
I'm not giving it away
and I'm not selling it.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.533
I want something else.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.100
10% of the team.

12:37.367 --> 12:38.600
10% of the team?

12:39.733 --> 12:41.933
Terrence and I would
be minority owners.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.633
You would finally
own your own home.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.900
Sloane could go back
to building soapboxes

12:46.967 --> 12:48.800
or clothes shopping
blindfolded,

12:48.867 --> 12:51.633
or whatever she
does in her free time.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.533
Everyone would get
what they want.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.667
Your call.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.233
Hi.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.467
Sorry.

13:11.533 --> 13:12.733
No one was answering
the door.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.900
I was looking for Derek.

13:14.967 --> 13:17.200
He was called into
practice early.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.067
I'm his girlfriend.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.700
Mandi.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.133
From the law office?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.067
The law...

13:26.267 --> 13:27.500
Right.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.533
I just came by to
give him something.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.800
I can give it
to him.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.467
No.

13:35.533 --> 13:36.833
It's okay.

13:46.267 --> 13:47.200
Derek?

13:48.833 --> 13:50.200
You came to give me
a kiss good luck?

13:50.267 --> 13:51.400
Who the hell
is Mandi?

13:51.467 --> 13:52.633
I told you, sh--

13:52.700 --> 13:53.633
I didn't ask what
you told me,

13:53.700 --> 13:54.933
I asked who she was.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.300
She came by your place
and had no idea

13:56.367 --> 13:57.700
what I was talking about

13:57.767 --> 14:00.400
when I mentioned
your lawyer.
She's just a friend.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.500
You don't have
girl friends.
It's nothing to
worry about--

14:02.567 --> 14:04.767
Then why are you sweating
before you've shot one basket?

14:04.833 --> 14:08.367
Ladies and gentlemen,
number 22, Derek Roman!

14:11.667 --> 14:12.600
Ahsha--

14:12.667 --> 14:14.133
I've lost Raquel.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.067
I've lost German.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.800
I-- I can't
lose you, too.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.333
If something's going on
with Mandi or whoever,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.800
you need to tell me.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.500
I...
Derek Roman!

14:22.567 --> 14:24.233
Hey, man, let's go.

15:59.267 --> 16:00.500
Mandi's my jeweler.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.567
This wasn't
hers to give.

16:03.633 --> 16:04.767
It was mine.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.633
My whole life, I've been
surrounded by people

16:08.700 --> 16:09.933
who wanted
something from me.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.167
And I gave it,

16:13.233 --> 16:14.467
because I wanted
them to stay.

16:17.667 --> 16:18.833
But you...

16:21.967 --> 16:23.800
... you never wanted
anything

16:23.867 --> 16:25.067
from me but me.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.267
I told you I'd either
be the best mistake

16:30.333 --> 16:32.233
you ever made or
I'd change your life.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.400
Well, it turns out,
you've changed mine.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.233
Ahsha Hayes,
will you marry me?

16:44.067 --> 16:47.433
Yes, Derek Roman,
I will marry you.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.800
It's been a real
dogfight tonight.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.667
We're in the last seconds
of the game.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.067
Zero looking to shoot.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.733
Passes inside to Roman--
Roman shoots!

17:35.800 --> 17:37.333
Makes it!

17:37.400 --> 17:38.367
Devils win!

17:39.767 --> 17:41.867
Wow, quite a night for
Derek Roman!

17:43.367 --> 17:44.300
Mom!

17:45.767 --> 17:46.967
Did you know?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.733
Sweetheart,
of course I didn't.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.067
But seeing that
smile...

17:52.200 --> 17:54.167
Aww, I couldn't
be happier.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.267
Congratulations.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.100
You and Terrence are now
minority owners

18:06.167 --> 18:07.133
of the Devils.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.400
Looks like
the arena's yours.

18:10.467 --> 18:11.433
Was there ever
any doubt?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.533
Thank her.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.800
She just saved
your life.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.433
Lionel.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.067
Thank you.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.400
For giving Sloane
the heads-up about Oscar.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.067
You're still
sitting with him.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.367
What does that mean
for you?

18:36.433 --> 18:38.167
You and I are
divorced.

18:38.233 --> 18:39.433
I'm not your
problem anymore.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.233
You'll always be
my problem, Lionel.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.133
Only now, I don't
mind it so much.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.500
If there's anything
I can do to help you...

18:51.567 --> 18:52.833
let me know.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.767
Zero.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.567
This TMZ story.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.967
Give me something.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.233
What TMZ story?

19:10.300 --> 19:11.500
They're saying you
were spotted with

19:11.567 --> 19:13.167
Stafford Bilchek,
the PI.

19:15.533 --> 19:16.833
Trouble in
paradise with Jude?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.533
Zero, they're gonna be
following this story.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.100
There's no story.

19:22.167 --> 19:23.100
Sorry.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.133
Elliott West?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.633
Kyle Hart.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.400
Now that we got that
out of the way,

19:33.467 --> 19:35.667
how about you tell me why
Raquel had me look you up?

19:35.733 --> 19:36.833
I'm her attorney.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.400
I'm settling her
estate.

19:38.467 --> 19:39.767
Oh.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.067
So I'm guessing
by her timing,

19:41.067 --> 19:42.100
she wanted me
to make sure it's

19:42.167 --> 19:43.867
all going down the way
she wanted.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.800
Everything she asked for
has been taken care of.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.633
Her accounts have
all been closed.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.100
Miguel's with Jesse.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.100
But that isn't
the reason for the timing.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.300
Raquel wanted you to have
something after she passed.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.167
What?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.067
What's on this?

20:09.133 --> 20:10.500
Your guess
is as good as mine.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.133
I thought
we were past it.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.600
I...

20:26.667 --> 20:28.300
thought Terrence
trusted me again.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.900
But I see now
he never will.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.433
The damage I did
to us, it's...

20:41.700 --> 20:42.833
... permanent.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.367
Am I so afraid of
being alone

20:57.433 --> 20:59.433
that I'd let
this continue?

21:03.333 --> 21:07.133
Go down a road that I know
is bad for me and for him?

21:17.733 --> 21:19.067
I miss you, Raquel.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.367
The Titanic was taken down
by a smaller rock.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.900
It was a good day
for the both of us.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.700
Some light at the end
of the tunnel.

21:33.767 --> 21:34.767
Feels good,
doesn't it?

21:34.833 --> 21:36.400
Mm-hmm.

21:36.467 --> 21:37.833
What about you two?

21:37.900 --> 21:39.433
That's the rock
I want to see.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.067
Mmm...

21:42.100 --> 21:43.300
Coach, are you
sweating?

21:43.367 --> 21:44.400
Yeah.

21:46.267 --> 21:47.200
Kyle.

21:47.267 --> 21:48.400
What are you
doing here?

21:48.467 --> 21:50.233
I have something
you'll want to see.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.567
Something you'll all
want to see.

21:55.533 --> 21:57.333
Exactly like he said.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.900
Everything German Vega said
happened that night

22:00.967 --> 22:02.867
at Olivia's happened.

22:02.933 --> 22:06.500
It was an accident,
but he didn't kill Olivia.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.200
I did.

22:09.267 --> 22:11.933
Olivia knew I was
undocumented.

22:12.067 --> 22:15.067
She threatened
to tell everyone.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.500
I could have lost
my son.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.500
I told German about it.

22:19.567 --> 22:23.067
He was a hero for trying to
take the blame, but...

22:23.133 --> 22:24.400
I can't let him.

22:24.467 --> 22:25.833
Saldana recorded her--

22:25.900 --> 22:27.400
Raquel left that video
for me to leak.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.500
Ten minutes after
I hit "send," it was up.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.833
I-- I can't believe Raquel
would do something

22:31.900 --> 22:33.600
like this for German.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.100
She wanted
this to stick.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.367
What happens now?

22:37.433 --> 22:39.100
They're saying it's
in the judge's hands.

22:49.633 --> 22:50.900
I signed the papers.

22:50.967 --> 22:52.600
Jelena.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.800
Good for you for
being the smart cookie

22:54.867 --> 22:56.067
I thought you were.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.867
You'll find minority
ownership

22:58.933 --> 23:00.400
carries
some privileges.

23:02.133 --> 23:03.567
Can't think of what they
are at the moment,

23:03.633 --> 23:06.667
but at least you're
guaranteed a parking spot.

23:08.067 --> 23:10.967
Good for you for
being so single-minded.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.600
You wanted the arena
and you got it.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.067
But not
without a cost.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.367
While...

23:23.433 --> 23:25.200
you may have convinced
the league

23:25.267 --> 23:27.667
to do business with you,

23:27.733 --> 23:30.367
the minority
stakeholders, well,

23:30.433 --> 23:32.167
they don't have as
much good will.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.733
The fact that I've been

23:35.800 --> 23:36.933
poisoning
them against you

23:37.067 --> 23:38.967
for weeks probably
hasn't helped.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.133
I am a smart cookie.

23:43.333 --> 23:46.333
Smart enough to find
another silent partner.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.867
Smart enough

23:47.933 --> 23:50.500
to systematically
tear down Lionel

23:50.567 --> 23:52.133
while convincing
the board that you were

23:52.200 --> 23:55.633
toxic enough to sell
their shares to me.

23:57.167 --> 23:59.067
Jude was the only one
with his eye on the ball.

24:00.467 --> 24:04.133
He tried to calm the board,
but the damage was done.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.333
All I needed
was that 10%,

24:07.400 --> 24:09.767
and the one thing
I knew that would

24:09.833 --> 24:12.067
get you to
part with it--

24:12.067 --> 24:13.367
the arena.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.833
Thanks to you,

24:17.900 --> 24:20.233
Terrence and I are now

24:20.300 --> 24:22.267
the majority owners
of the Devils.

24:30.967 --> 24:32.500
Enjoy your
parking spot.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.533
I can't
believe it, Ahsh.

25:06.867 --> 25:07.933
What Raquel
did for me--

25:08.067 --> 25:10.067
I know.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.267
This is what
she wanted.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.600
Now I just have to
live with it.

25:16.233 --> 25:17.367
What are you
gonna do?

25:19.700 --> 25:20.633
I don't know.

25:21.967 --> 25:22.900
I could do
anything now.

25:24.667 --> 25:25.600
Thanks to her.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.600
Derek?

25:38.067 --> 25:39.167
That was fast.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.800
I understand why this
would upset you.

25:45.367 --> 25:46.733
You and I have
been through so much.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.267
It is about
you and me.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.600
But not the way
you think.

25:55.733 --> 25:57.567
We're so far
from where we started.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.367
There was a time when

26:00.433 --> 26:02.400
a $5,000 bracelet
set you off.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.900
Now...

26:06.967 --> 26:09.200
I can't even imagine
how much this cost.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.233
You changed.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.733
What I've
gone through...

26:22.300 --> 26:23.500
... I could never
go back.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.433
I don't want something
to happen to you

26:27.500 --> 26:28.800
that you
can't recover from.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.267
What could happen?

26:35.267 --> 26:36.500
I don't know.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.333
I can only hope that
you can protect yourself.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.933
That you know how
far is too far...

26:48.700 --> 26:50.200
... before you can
ever make it back.

27:00.167 --> 27:01.167
Well?

27:01.233 --> 27:02.367
How'd it go with
your sister?

27:05.133 --> 27:06.267
That bad?

27:07.333 --> 27:08.900
I didn't call her.

27:08.967 --> 27:11.733
And I'm not
going to.
Why not?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.300
You worked so hard
to find her.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.767
And...

27:16.833 --> 27:17.833
I did.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.067
She's doing great.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.333
And I can't
risk that.

27:25.367 --> 27:26.633
She had
a horrible life.

27:27.867 --> 27:30.067
I don't want her to
have to relive that.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.600
I got reporters up my ass

27:31.667 --> 27:34.400
and who knows what
they'd dig up on her.

27:36.967 --> 27:39.600
I just...

27:39.667 --> 27:41.467
I just have to leave
well enough alone.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.433
Besides...

27:55.533 --> 27:59.733
I realized...
I already have a family.

28:04.067 --> 28:05.100
You.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.667
This is the house
I grew up in.

28:15.133 --> 28:16.067
It still has
the sledgehammer

28:16.133 --> 28:17.067
I put in
the wall.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.567
I bought it.

28:19.633 --> 28:20.733
I put it under
both our names.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.233
I figured we could
renovate it

28:22.300 --> 28:24.100
and make that neighborhood
the new place to be...

28:26.067 --> 28:26.933
... if you want.

28:29.067 --> 28:30.767
Of course I want,
stupid.

28:45.067 --> 28:45.933
Hello?

28:46.067 --> 28:47.233
I just heard.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.400
Oscar's been bounced.

28:48.467 --> 28:50.467
Terrence and Jelena
own the team.

28:50.533 --> 28:51.900
Terrence and--

28:51.967 --> 28:53.467
Oscar is pissed.

28:53.533 --> 28:54.633
He didn't
see it coming.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.333
I don't know how
they did it.

28:57.567 --> 28:58.700
Hang on a sec,
I got another call.

29:00.067 --> 29:01.067
Hello?

29:01.100 --> 29:02.133
He's out of control.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.367
Lionel,
who's out of control?

29:04.433 --> 29:05.933
Oscar.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.433
He lost the team.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.533
The way he's
looking at me...

29:09.600 --> 29:10.767
Where are you?

29:10.833 --> 29:12.433
I'm hiding
in his garage.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.333
Pete, I don't know what
he's gonna do.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.533
Stay there!

29:27.433 --> 29:29.300
Hey, how'd it
go with German?

29:29.367 --> 29:30.433
He's released.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.733
It's a huge
weight off.

29:33.533 --> 29:35.233
For someone with
a huge weight off

29:35.300 --> 29:37.100
and a giant weight
on your finger,

29:37.167 --> 29:38.100
you don't
look too happy.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.233
That's the thing.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.833
I'm happy.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.100
People keep telling me my
life like it's a bad thing,

29:45.167 --> 29:46.833
but I like it.

29:46.900 --> 29:47.867
I love it.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.767
I'm a grown-ass woman.

29:50.833 --> 29:52.433
This is where
I want to be,

29:52.500 --> 29:54.067
in this arena,
with you.

29:57.167 --> 29:59.400
I wish I could be
Mrs. Derek Roman right now.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.567
No joke.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.667
My plane is gassed up
on the runway.

30:02.733 --> 30:03.867
We could
leave tonight.

30:06.267 --> 30:08.133
What if...

30:08.200 --> 30:09.133
I wasn't joking?

30:11.033 --> 30:11.967
What are you saying?

30:14.867 --> 30:16.567
We aren't guaranteed
any moments.

30:18.467 --> 30:20.567
And...

30:20.633 --> 30:21.767
I want to
seize this one.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.533
With you.

30:27.000 --> 30:27.933
Let's elope.

30:29.967 --> 30:31.033
I could be packed

30:31.100 --> 30:32.833
and outside your place
in a limo by 8:00.

30:38.467 --> 30:39.400
See you there.

30:45.067 --> 30:46.000
Wow.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.933
You stagger me.

30:51.233 --> 30:52.400
The way you stole
this team

30:52.467 --> 30:55.367
out from under
Oscar Kinkade.

30:55.433 --> 30:57.900
Oscar Kinkade.

31:04.567 --> 31:05.833
Mm-mm-mmm.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.833
"Jelena Howard.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.700
"Jelena Howard.

31:12.767 --> 31:14.133
Jelena Howard."

31:14.200 --> 31:15.800
My name's not on any
of these, only yours.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.233
We can't be
joined this way.

31:23.267 --> 31:24.333
I can give you
equity.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.633
Give me equity?

31:25.700 --> 31:27.800
Jelena, what the hell
is going on?

31:29.133 --> 31:32.300
This partnership
doesn't work, Terrence.

31:32.367 --> 31:33.567
On any level.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.533
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.300
But you know

31:41.367 --> 31:44.067
how important having
a child was to me.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.533
And it's not now?

31:48.167 --> 31:50.567
I will never be able to
give you what you need.

31:52.633 --> 31:53.867
You can't live
like that.

31:55.167 --> 31:56.100
Neither can I.

31:56.167 --> 31:57.633
Just take
a deep breath.

31:59.133 --> 32:01.067
People ask why
we're together.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.733
You know the real
reason?

32:04.867 --> 32:06.067
Because you get
to be good cop

32:06.133 --> 32:07.767
while I get
to be bad cop.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.100
And right now, I have to
be bad cop

32:11.167 --> 32:12.633
and do what
has to be done.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.133
You are
punking out on us.

32:15.633 --> 32:17.267
And making sure your
ass is covered.

32:20.233 --> 32:22.667
How can you do this to
someone you say you love?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.067
Give me back
my ring.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.067
We could have
had it all, Jelena!

33:18.300 --> 33:19.233
Lionel?

33:20.867 --> 33:22.433
What are you
doing here?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.867
What-- what am I--
you-- you called me here.

33:24.933 --> 33:26.533
You told me that Oscar was
trying to hurt you.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.067
You weren't supposed to be
here for another 20 minutes.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.067
You have ruined
everything.

33:31.133 --> 33:33.100
Lionel, what the hell
is going on?

33:37.733 --> 33:39.100
I'm trapped in
this marriage, Pete.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.267
To Oscar.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.333
I am trapped.

33:44.967 --> 33:46.833
This was my way out.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.300
Set him up,
put him back in jail

33:49.367 --> 33:52.067
for murder he made to
look like a suicide.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.333
That's crazy.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.733
No, that's desperate.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.467
I broke the key off
in the ignition

34:00.533 --> 34:02.167
and disabled
the garage door.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.367
You were supposed to
show up in time

34:03.433 --> 34:06.700
to get me out of here,
call the police.

34:06.767 --> 34:08.700
I timed your
drive from the arena.

34:08.767 --> 34:10.500
I wasn't at
the arena.

34:10.567 --> 34:11.800
I was on the road.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.133
Come on,
there's another way.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.533
Come on.

34:25.467 --> 34:26.900
Did you close this?

34:26.967 --> 34:28.233
It closed itself.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.267
Get your cell.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.467
It's in my car.

34:32.533 --> 34:33.967
Where's yours?

34:34.067 --> 34:35.167
It's in the house.

34:42.267 --> 34:44.467
Oscar's not running
the team anymore.

34:44.533 --> 34:45.833
You and Terrence
pulled it off?

34:48.267 --> 34:50.800
My first order of business
is taking out the trash.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.167
I'm trading you.

34:54.700 --> 34:55.633
You can't do that.

34:55.700 --> 34:57.067
I can and I did.

34:59.067 --> 35:00.400
Payback's a bitch...

35:01.700 --> 35:02.833
... bitch.

35:09.633 --> 35:11.067
What just happened?

35:14.133 --> 35:15.267
We're not gonna
be moving into that

35:15.333 --> 35:16.900
new place anytime
soon.

35:20.067 --> 35:22.167
Jelena's trading me.

35:22.233 --> 35:23.200
Jelena?

35:24.733 --> 35:26.600
Your pops isn't in
the big chair anymore.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.067
He got kicked to
the gutter.

35:30.133 --> 35:31.967
That means I got
kicked to the gutter.

35:32.067 --> 35:33.467
Look, we'll--

35:33.533 --> 35:36.500
we'll find a better house
wherever we wind up.

35:36.567 --> 35:37.933
You'll run that town.

35:38.067 --> 35:39.400
I can't go anywhere.

35:40.933 --> 35:42.300
Lionel.

35:42.367 --> 35:44.067
Without the team, Oscar
won't have anything else

35:44.067 --> 35:45.467
to focus on but her.

35:48.367 --> 35:49.867
I can't leave her
here to him.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.100
Well, if I have to go
and you have to stay...

35:56.233 --> 35:57.433
... where does
that leave us?

36:12.867 --> 36:14.067
You got what you wanted.

36:16.167 --> 36:18.633
And you used me as
a smokescreen to do it.

36:19.900 --> 36:21.400
If I would have made
the offer cold,

36:21.467 --> 36:23.200
he would have
scrutinized it more.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.400
This required an element
of surprise.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.067
It worked on Terrence.

36:30.933 --> 36:32.967
I called the league to
find out what happened.

36:34.267 --> 36:35.467
I know what you
did to him.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.567
All the time
I spent with that man...

36:40.933 --> 36:42.567
... all he did was
defend you.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.067
You're indefensible.

36:46.567 --> 36:47.967
You cut out
his heart.

36:50.067 --> 36:53.467
You're ambitious,
you're selfish...

36:53.533 --> 36:56.500
and now you're alone,
as you should be.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.067
Pack up your crap.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.800
The last person I fired
wound up in a ditch,

37:02.867 --> 37:04.100
so good luck to you.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.433
Good luck to
Ahsha, too.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.633
I'm going to
enjoy being her boss.

37:10.633 --> 37:11.967
You will not
get to her.

37:13.067 --> 37:14.167
I won't let you.

37:15.433 --> 37:16.367
I already have.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.667
She's already been
corrupted,

37:19.733 --> 37:21.600
keeping secrets,

37:21.667 --> 37:23.767
doing things you and Ahsha,
for that matter,

37:23.833 --> 37:25.200
never thought she'd do.

37:26.533 --> 37:28.500
And deep down,
you know it, too.

37:31.067 --> 37:33.700
Imagine how much Ahsha
will blossom under me

37:33.767 --> 37:35.300
without you
to run protection.

37:37.467 --> 37:38.433
I own the team.

37:39.933 --> 37:41.067
I own Ahsha.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.633
And there isn't a damn
thing you can do about it.

37:56.467 --> 37:57.467
Sorry.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.067
Thought I'd find
my parents here.

37:59.133 --> 38:00.500
I was looking for
your dad, too,

38:00.567 --> 38:02.067
'cause I want
off this team.

38:04.267 --> 38:05.833
You were right
to hate her.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.467
Jelena managed
the ultimate steal.

38:07.533 --> 38:09.067
She took the team
from Oscar.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.333
You own the Devils?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.200
She owns
the Devils.

38:12.267 --> 38:13.733
She cut me out.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.700
Used your mother
to do it.

38:15.767 --> 38:17.233
Used my--

38:17.300 --> 38:19.467
She's got all the power now,
and you better watch out.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.267
Especially now that
you're engaged to D...

38:23.867 --> 38:25.167
... you'll be
the star.

38:25.233 --> 38:27.300
I'm not
scared of her.

38:27.367 --> 38:28.667
She never goes direct.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.467
She'll come after
what you love the most.

38:33.533 --> 38:34.900
Guard your man.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.067
She'll break you up even if
she has to ruin him to do it.

38:38.467 --> 38:40.300
And she knows all
his secrets.

39:03.867 --> 39:05.167
It's Ahsha, leave a message.

39:06.267 --> 39:07.500
Hey, Ahsha.

39:07.567 --> 39:09.533
Seeing where you're at,
call me.

39:55.233 --> 39:56.500
Hello?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.133
Hello?
