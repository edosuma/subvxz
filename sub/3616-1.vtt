WEBVTT

00:02.301 --> 00:07.255
In this night and in this hour
I call upon the ancient power

00:07.855 --> 00:10.132
Bring back my sister

00:10.532 --> 00:13.009
Bring back the power of three

00:23.316 --> 00:25.315
Power of the witches, rise

00:25.633 --> 00:29.190
Course unseen across the skies
Come to us who call you near

00:29.509 --> 00:31.507
Come to us and settle here

00:42.933 --> 00:46.050
Blood to blood, I summon thee

00:46.649 --> 00:48.647
Blood to blood, return to me

01:06.146 --> 01:07.844
Piper?

01:07.944 --> 01:09.942
Prue?

01:14.736 --> 01:17.732
Sweetie, it's 4:00
in the morning.

01:18.052 --> 01:20.050
What are you doing?

01:21.648 --> 01:23.645
You're bleeding.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.962
I don't understand
why magic can't fix this.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.237
Why it can't bring Prue back. It's not
like we haven't cheated death before.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.994
I don't understand why this time
is any different.

01:35.072 --> 01:37.988
Because Leo can't heal the dead,
Piper. You know that.

01:38.788 --> 01:41.165
There's other magic,
magic that we've used before:

01:41.265 --> 01:45.100
Scrying, calling a lost witch,
reversing time...

01:45.460 --> 01:47.637
Like, the Book just deserted us,
and deserted Prue.

01:47.737 --> 01:50.694
And I don't understand why.

01:52.092 --> 01:53.989
We lost our sister.

01:54.089 --> 01:56.127
How can we ever understand that?

01:58.284 --> 02:02.520
We have tried every magical way
to bring her back.

02:03.118 --> 02:05.116
But we can't.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.073
She's gone.

02:11.109 --> 02:14.186
I just... I thank God
that I didn't lose you too.

02:20.179 --> 02:22.176
We have to get some rest.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.772
Prue will never forgive us
if we look bad at her funeral.

02:52.820 --> 02:55.217
Social Services, can I help you?

03:03.688 --> 03:05.685
Printing.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.575
South Bay Social Services,
may I help you?

03:33.092 --> 03:35.490
Paige, you find that study yet?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.501
- Paige, did you hear me?
- Yeah, it's in the printer.

03:42.601 --> 03:46.277
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- What do you mean, go? Go where?

03:47.555 --> 03:50.033
Paige! Hey, Paige!

04:47.005 --> 04:50.522
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, no, thanks, sweetie.

04:59.671 --> 05:01.668
Look who's back.

05:05.343 --> 05:07.342
Cole.

05:11.537 --> 05:13.694
I was afraid you weren't
gonna make it to the funeral.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.632
Well, I...

05:15.732 --> 05:18.588
I can't make it. Or shouldn't, anyway.

05:18.688 --> 05:21.086
The Source has every demonic
bounty hunter looking for me.

05:21.485 --> 05:24.061
Yeah, so, what else is new?

05:24.161 --> 05:26.778
This is different.
Saving you makes it different.

05:26.878 --> 05:28.217
It makes me a traitor.

05:28.317 --> 05:29.935
He's not gonna stop
until he finds me.

05:30.035 --> 05:31.892
I don't want that happening
at Prue's funeral.

05:31.992 --> 05:34.130
- So we'll protect you.
- You can't protect me.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.767
Why not? We're still witches,
aren't we?

05:36.867 --> 05:39.384
Yeah, but you're not
the Charmed Ones anymore.

05:40.263 --> 05:42.261
He's right.
Without the power of three...

05:42.580 --> 05:47.015
I don't understand. Isn't it harder
to track a demon in a cemetery, Cole?

05:48.133 --> 05:50.310
You have to go.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.409
I need you there.

05:55.445 --> 05:57.842
Hey. How are you holding up?

05:58.961 --> 06:00.958
Okay.

06:02.636 --> 06:05.013
- It's sweet of you to stop by.
- Had to.

06:05.113 --> 06:07.570
Besides, you should know
they're assigning Prue's case

06:07.670 --> 06:09.668
- to another inspector.
- What case?

06:10.227 --> 06:12.045
"What case?" Are you kidding?

06:12.145 --> 06:14.402
Prue and a prominent doctor
were killed here, Leo.

06:14.502 --> 06:17.259
Made a lot of press.
People want answers.

06:17.579 --> 06:18.717
Important people.

06:18.817 --> 06:21.973
So, what's this guy gonna find, that
it was some kind of demonic hit man?

06:22.293 --> 06:23.711
- Give me a break.
- He might.

06:23.811 --> 06:26.028
Look, you don't know him like I do.

06:26.128 --> 06:28.905
He'll keep looking
until he finds something.

06:29.005 --> 06:30.863
- Believe me.
- I'm not worried.

06:30.963 --> 06:33.360
Well, I am. I saw what happened
when they were exposed as witches.

06:34.119 --> 06:36.576
Time may have reversed itself,
but it still cost Prue her life.

06:36.676 --> 06:38.214
Would you people mind?

06:38.314 --> 06:41.830
For God's sake, we're burying
my daughter today. Can't this wait?

06:56.214 --> 06:58.211
Piper?

06:58.929 --> 07:00.708
Honey...

07:00.808 --> 07:02.806
...we have to go.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.922
I don't wanna go.

07:08.598 --> 07:10.597
Why not?

07:12.634 --> 07:15.031
Because if I go,

07:15.790 --> 07:19.306
that'll mean that Prue's
really not coming back.

07:20.145 --> 07:23.141
And I don't think I can handle that.

07:25.139 --> 07:27.376
We can handle it together.

07:29.215 --> 07:32.730
She's been there my whole life.

07:34.807 --> 07:36.806
I've always had a big sister.

07:37.804 --> 07:41.200
And I don't know how to live
without one.

07:42.558 --> 07:44.556
Piper.

07:46.035 --> 07:48.192
Why didn't you save her?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.504
- I tried.
- But you didn't.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.221
Why didn't they let you
save her too?

07:57.701 --> 07:59.698
The Elders?

08:00.537 --> 08:03.014
They couldn't.
They don't have that kind of power.

08:04.773 --> 08:06.770
Then what the hell good are they?

08:12.483 --> 08:14.062
It's okay to be angry.

08:14.162 --> 08:18.276
I'm not angry. I am pissed off.

08:19.036 --> 08:21.673
Don't you understand?
You healed the wrong sister.

08:22.072 --> 08:24.669
You saved me
because I'm your damn wife,

08:25.068 --> 08:27.765
and you should have saved her
because she was the best,

08:27.865 --> 08:29.843
because she...

08:29.943 --> 08:31.940
You should...

08:39.691 --> 08:42.967
Why did they put us through
so much

08:43.285 --> 08:46.243
for it to end this way?

08:53.275 --> 08:55.272
May I be seen?

08:55.952 --> 09:00.786
- Have you found Belthazor?
- No, something else.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.875
Something more important, perhaps.

09:10.975 --> 09:12.972
Nothing is more important.

09:13.651 --> 09:15.269
Not even the Charmed Ones?

09:15.369 --> 09:18.366
- The Charmed Ones are dead.
- Not all of them.

09:19.004 --> 09:21.781
One gone ends the threat.

09:21.881 --> 09:25.258
Of course, if you had foreseen
that a whitelighter

09:25.358 --> 09:31.470
was going to help Belthazor
save his witch, they'd all be gone.

09:33.068 --> 09:38.342
Be grateful I don't turn you
into a snake.

09:38.741 --> 09:42.816
Yes, but then how would you see
into the future without me?

09:43.136 --> 09:46.333
Without the Charmed Ones
to worry about anymore,

09:46.652 --> 09:49.250
I may not need to.

09:49.728 --> 09:52.345
Well, in that case, you better
keep me around

09:52.445 --> 09:54.443
a little while longer.

09:55.202 --> 09:57.479
What do you see?

09:59.117 --> 10:01.116
I see...

10:01.634 --> 10:04.791
...a witch's call on the spirit winds.

10:05.111 --> 10:07.108
I see...

10:08.107 --> 10:10.105
...another.

10:51.455 --> 10:54.932
"... that which belongs
to fellowship and love,

10:55.451 --> 10:58.068
that which belongs
to the circle

10:58.168 --> 11:02.003
remains with us.
The wheel turns.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.058
As life is a day,

11:06.158 --> 11:08.516
so our sister has passed
into night.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.232
Nothing is final.

11:11.832 --> 11:17.106
And we who remain behind know
that one day we will once again

11:17.505 --> 11:20.661
share the bread and wine
with our sister. "

11:20.981 --> 11:23.178
Oh, blessed spirit,

11:24.616 --> 11:26.814
we bid you farewell,

11:27.773 --> 11:30.570
for you await a new destiny.

12:18.514 --> 12:20.511
I'm so sorry for your loss.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.988
Thank you.

12:23.468 --> 12:25.585
How did you know Prue?

12:26.104 --> 12:28.102
- From work?
- No, just...

12:29.620 --> 12:31.698
Just from around.

12:32.457 --> 12:34.275
You know.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.372
Have we met somewhere?

12:37.012 --> 12:39.009
No, I don't... I don't think so.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.986
Anyway,

12:42.086 --> 12:44.183
my condolences.

12:44.283 --> 12:46.280
Thank you.

12:53.752 --> 12:56.029
- Phoebe?
- Phoebe.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.524
- Are you all right?
- I saw him.

12:59.624 --> 13:01.842
- The demon that killed Prue.
- Shax?

13:01.942 --> 13:03.839
- What was he doing?
- He was killing that girl.

13:03.939 --> 13:05.997
- What girl?
- The one I was just talking to.

13:06.097 --> 13:08.095
We gotta go find her.

13:10.612 --> 13:12.610
Go, go!

13:21.279 --> 13:23.276
Stop it.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.990
Stop it, stop it, stop it, damn it!

13:29.430 --> 13:33.465
This is Prue's funeral,
for God sakes!

13:33.824 --> 13:37.460
Can we at least bury her in peace?
Is that too much to ask?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.507
Thank you.

14:17.014 --> 14:19.271
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Who?

14:19.371 --> 14:21.508
The girl from my premonition.

14:21.608 --> 14:23.386
Phoebe,

14:23.486 --> 14:25.623
- you need to be more careful.
- I'm sorry.

14:25.723 --> 14:28.400
Are you sure you don't recognize her
from anywhere?

14:28.920 --> 14:33.554
Well, she did look familiar,
like I've seen her somewhere before.

14:33.913 --> 14:36.111
But somehow we have to find her
before night falls,

14:36.430 --> 14:38.469
- or else...
- Honey, what are you doing?

14:40.466 --> 14:42.683
- I'm cleaning.
- You don't clean. You hate cleaning.

14:42.783 --> 14:45.260
I know, but it's better
than falling apart, isn't it?

14:46.299 --> 14:48.196
Maybe you should just try
and focus on the girl.

14:48.296 --> 14:49.795
She was attacked on a rooftop?

14:49.895 --> 14:52.132
Yeah, one with a helipad.

14:52.612 --> 14:54.349
But it wasn't a tall building,

14:54.449 --> 14:56.667
although there were a lot of
taller buildings around it.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.144
Okay, so we just need to figure out
which building it was

14:59.244 --> 15:01.481
- before Shax does.
- And do what exactly?

15:04.118 --> 15:06.675
You can't defeat Shax,
not without the power of three.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.132
Well, you and Prue did.

15:09.232 --> 15:11.230
That's because Prue
was the strongest.

15:11.550 --> 15:14.165
Trying to do it without her
would be suicide.

15:14.265 --> 15:18.541
Yeah, but... Maybe so, but I got that
premonition for a reason, Piper.

15:18.900 --> 15:22.036
That girl is our innocent,
so we have to try and save her.

15:22.136 --> 15:24.174
Says who? Why do we have to?

15:24.574 --> 15:26.271
- Piper.
- What?

15:26.371 --> 15:29.568
Do you really expect us to keep doing
this stuff after what happened?

15:29.888 --> 15:32.664
To keep risking our lives? Do they?

15:32.764 --> 15:35.940
- Piper, keep your voice down.
- No, Leo, I won't.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.277
I don't wanna do this anymore,
okay? It's... It's over.

15:40.076 --> 15:42.912
You can tell them we buried
their precious Charmed Ones

15:43.232 --> 15:45.669
when we buried our sister.

15:50.303 --> 15:52.121
No, leave her be.

15:52.221 --> 15:54.219
She needs to be alone.

15:56.217 --> 15:58.514
Look, I don't know
where we go from here.

15:58.614 --> 16:01.131
But I do know
that I can't let that girl die.

16:01.570 --> 16:04.027
Especially not by the same demon
that killed Prue.

16:04.127 --> 16:06.264
The question still remains:
How are you gonna stop Shax

16:06.364 --> 16:08.761
without the power of three
to say the vanquishing spell?

16:09.441 --> 16:12.797
I'm hoping that a demon and a witch
fighting together might be enough.

16:14.235 --> 16:16.233
Interested?

16:17.791 --> 16:19.209
Why not? Beats sitting around here

16:19.309 --> 16:21.547
waiting for the next bounty hunter
to attack.

16:23.864 --> 16:27.300
I appreciate you coming over.
It means so much to the girls.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.616
Dad? Excuse us, Aaron.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.610
- We have to go. Will you be okay?
- Go where?

16:36.569 --> 16:38.567
Trust me, you don't wanna know.

16:39.086 --> 16:41.124
Phoebe, Victor?

16:41.683 --> 16:45.718
Sorry about this, but Inspector Cortez
insisted on meeting today.

16:46.078 --> 16:48.795
I just wanted to extend
my deepest sympathies.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.132
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:51.232 --> 16:53.230
I'll get the car.

16:55.267 --> 16:57.124
- Where's Piper?
- Upstairs.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.121
- She's not feeling well.
- Understandable.

17:00.221 --> 17:02.219
I lost a sister once myself.

17:02.618 --> 17:04.276
I know how hard it is.

17:04.376 --> 17:07.733
We're gonna find the monster who
did this to your sister, Miss Halliwell.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.089
I promise you this.

17:11.167 --> 17:13.025
Something I said?

17:13.125 --> 17:14.863
No.

17:14.963 --> 17:17.839
Just the word "monster. "

17:18.240 --> 17:19.936
Well, that's what he was.

17:20.037 --> 17:22.036
How else do you describe
somebody so vicious?

17:22.594 --> 17:24.592
We gotta stop him
before he strikes again.

17:25.271 --> 17:27.449
I couldn't agree more.

17:27.549 --> 17:29.406
If you'll excuse me, inspector.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.783
I know what a difficult time this is
for you and your sister, Miss Halliwell,

17:33.102 --> 17:35.100
- but we really need to talk.
- But not now.

17:37.777 --> 17:40.454
Of course. Sorry.

17:43.649 --> 17:46.346
I am a witch, damn it.
I've summoned people before,

17:46.446 --> 17:49.503
and I'm going to summon Prue
whether you like it or not.

17:49.603 --> 17:52.380
No more playing games,
no more being the good witch.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.615
I want to talk to my sister.
I need to talk to my sister.

17:55.715 --> 17:58.112
At the very least, you owe me that.

18:01.909 --> 18:05.744
Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

18:06.063 --> 18:08.600
Come to me, I summon thee

18:08.700 --> 18:11.337
Cross now the great divide

18:18.369 --> 18:21.166
- Grams.
- Hello, my darling.

18:21.485 --> 18:22.864
How are you?

18:22.964 --> 18:25.381
How am I? Are you kidding?

18:25.481 --> 18:27.478
Do you guys not get the news
up there?

18:28.238 --> 18:32.193
- I meant, how are you holding up?
- Not very well.

18:33.271 --> 18:35.788
I'm a little lost.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.844
Why didn't you come before
when I called after...?

18:38.944 --> 18:42.221
I couldn't, Piper. I was busy.

18:43.259 --> 18:45.257
You were busy?

18:45.736 --> 18:47.734
I was with Prue.

18:49.013 --> 18:52.248
Of course you were. Right.
Well, that would make sense.

18:52.808 --> 18:54.805
Is she okay?

18:55.285 --> 18:58.122
Your mother and I
are helping her through this.

18:58.442 --> 19:00.439
But how is she?

19:00.799 --> 19:02.457
I'm not allowed to tell you now,

19:02.557 --> 19:05.293
just like you're not allowed
to see her,

19:05.393 --> 19:08.190
at least not for a while anyway.

19:08.749 --> 19:10.687
Why?

19:10.787 --> 19:13.983
Because seeing Prue right now,
speaking to her,

19:14.303 --> 19:16.120
keeps her alive for you,

19:16.220 --> 19:19.097
which keeps you from being able
to move on with your life,

19:19.817 --> 19:21.814
to continue your destiny.

19:23.092 --> 19:27.008
What destiny?
Okay, it's over, it's done.

19:27.328 --> 19:30.284
Prue is gone, and I...

19:31.043 --> 19:33.020
I know, sweetie, I know.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.997
But if there's one thing you've
learned over the last three years

19:37.355 --> 19:39.593
it's that there's always
a reason for everything.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.149
Which means there's a reason
for this too.

19:45.506 --> 19:48.263
Your destiny still awaits.

19:53.936 --> 19:55.934
Blessed be.

20:01.607 --> 20:03.424
Anything?

20:03.524 --> 20:07.201
Unfortunately, since the last attack,
Belthazor has been very elusive.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.556
Leave Belthazor
to the bounty hunters.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.813
What about the other?

20:12.913 --> 20:14.992
Her future's becoming
much more clear.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.728
And it appears...

20:17.828 --> 20:19.825
...short-lived.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.747
Wasn't that good?
That was good, huh?

20:55.583 --> 20:58.720
- You all right?
- Me? Yeah.

20:58.820 --> 20:59.919
Why?

21:00.019 --> 21:03.934
Well, you just seem a little quieter
than usual, that's all.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.750
What makes you think
I'm not like this all the time?

21:06.850 --> 21:09.786
Well, we've been dating
for a month now,

21:09.886 --> 21:11.884
so I think I'd know.

21:12.443 --> 21:15.260
- Hey, can we get a couple longnecks?
- Sure.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.477
Make mine a mineral water, please.
Thanks.

21:18.317 --> 21:20.694
So much for how well
you know me, cowboy.

21:20.794 --> 21:22.611
I don't drink.

21:22.711 --> 21:25.348
I used to have kind of a problem
with certain liquids.

21:26.028 --> 21:28.205
Lots of problems, actually,

21:28.305 --> 21:30.043
but that's all behind me.

21:30.143 --> 21:32.940
- Do you want to go someplace else?
- No. No, no, no. I like it here.

21:33.818 --> 21:38.093
Gosh, I should, I've been coming to P3
for the last year or so, on and off,

21:38.453 --> 21:40.510
I mean, ever since...

21:40.610 --> 21:42.627
Ever since what?

21:42.727 --> 21:45.164
Oh, no, never mind. It's boring.

21:47.482 --> 21:51.158
All right, but if I tell you
all about Paige

21:51.478 --> 21:54.573
and you use it against me,

21:54.673 --> 21:57.870
I will get out my voodoo doll
and make you sorry you're a man.

21:59.508 --> 22:03.943
So my sad story is that I'm adopted,
only it's not so sad,

22:04.302 --> 22:07.858
because I loved my parents.
God rest.

22:08.857 --> 22:12.333
So after they died,
I went searching for my birth mother,

22:12.653 --> 22:14.750
hoping to get some answers.

22:14.850 --> 22:18.525
I went to the police station, found
the church where I was dumped at.

22:19.684 --> 22:23.479
I checked around. I figured she must
have lived near there, you know?

22:23.799 --> 22:25.957
Even thought I might have been...

22:26.956 --> 22:29.333
...related to the Halliwell sisters
for a minute,

22:29.433 --> 22:32.549
but their mom died a long time ago,
so I gave up on that.

22:33.308 --> 22:36.984
Well, did you ever try to meet
the sisters, ask them about it, or...?

22:37.303 --> 22:40.460
Yeah, right. "Hi, I think your mom
abandoned me at birth.

22:40.779 --> 22:43.616
What's for dinner?"
No, I don't think so.

22:43.936 --> 22:45.634
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

22:45.734 --> 22:47.731
You're welcome.

22:48.171 --> 22:51.806
So that... That still doesn't explain
why you keep coming here.

22:53.005 --> 22:57.160
Well, one of the sisters
owns it, so...

22:58.079 --> 23:02.274
I don't know, I guess I just
kind of feel connected somehow.

23:03.952 --> 23:06.549
That's why I went
to the funeral today.

23:07.468 --> 23:10.105
I just kind of felt like I had to.

23:11.663 --> 23:15.498
Okay, I sound certifiably insane now.

23:15.858 --> 23:17.855
Good job, Paige, way to go.

23:26.206 --> 23:28.203
Don't hurt me, okay?

23:30.401 --> 23:33.198
I can't handle any more right now.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.658
Come on.
I have something to show you.

24:12.311 --> 24:13.850
Here.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.568
Thanks.

24:15.668 --> 24:17.805
I think this is the right place,
but maybe we should try

24:17.905 --> 24:20.002
one of the other rooftops
just to make sure.

24:20.102 --> 24:22.759
Or maybe we should follow your
first instincts and stay right here.

24:22.859 --> 24:25.556
Okay, but what if I'm wrong?
That girl will get killed.

24:25.656 --> 24:29.171
You can't save every innocent,
Phoebe. Or stop every demon.

24:29.771 --> 24:33.087
Yeah. Well, I have to stop this one.

24:33.966 --> 24:36.223
I just hope that by me saying
the vanquishing spell,

24:36.323 --> 24:39.000
it wounds him enough
that you can take him out.

24:39.599 --> 24:42.376
I got a better idea. How about
you and me go someplace.

24:42.476 --> 24:45.033
You know, drop off the face of
the earth. Disappear.

24:46.631 --> 24:48.629
Don't tempt me.

24:49.308 --> 24:51.765
Things have changed, Phoebe.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.563
We can't pretend
we can go on like this.

24:53.663 --> 24:55.880
It's only a matter of time
before The Source finds me,

24:55.980 --> 24:58.217
which means every minute
you're with me, you're in danger.

24:58.817 --> 25:01.334
I've lost too much already, Cole.

25:02.052 --> 25:04.051
I'm not losing you too.

25:08.645 --> 25:11.003
Looks like your instincts were right.

25:11.921 --> 25:14.618
- We gotta shimmer over there.
- And tell her what?

25:14.718 --> 25:17.755
That a demon's about to attack?
I think we should stay right here.

25:20.312 --> 25:22.489
Aren't you afraid
that we're gonna get caught?

25:22.589 --> 25:25.226
I like an element of danger.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.962
Oh, look at the stars.

25:28.062 --> 25:30.060
They're so beautiful.

25:35.613 --> 25:38.969
They make me feel free.

25:54.031 --> 25:56.268
All right. Any ideas?

25:56.628 --> 25:57.927
A couple.

25:58.027 --> 26:00.164
I mean about what we do now.

26:00.264 --> 26:03.001
I mean, we can't just keep watching.
It's just not right.

26:03.101 --> 26:05.558
You're right. We shouldn't
just keep watching.

26:05.658 --> 26:07.656
Okay, very good.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.765
Shane!

26:24.835 --> 26:26.833
She orbed.

26:31.628 --> 26:34.443
She orbed. Did you just see that?

26:34.543 --> 26:36.541
Come on.

26:43.014 --> 26:45.551
- What the hell?
- Get out of here. Hurry, go!

26:45.651 --> 26:47.648
Go!

26:49.566 --> 26:51.064
Say the spell, damn it!

26:51.164 --> 26:53.741
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

26:53.841 --> 26:55.998
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

27:01.392 --> 27:03.390
Cole!

27:07.784 --> 27:10.861
- That was too close.
- It's okay, I'm all right.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.698
It's your innocent I'm worried about.

27:18.492 --> 27:21.029
Are you sure she orbed? Are you sure
it wasn't something else?

27:21.129 --> 27:24.604
Leo, she disappeared.
Bright white shiny thingies came,

27:24.924 --> 27:27.261
and then she reappeared.
What else could it be?

27:27.361 --> 27:29.419
- It just doesn't make any sense.
- Why not?

27:29.519 --> 27:31.176
Why would Shax
want to kill a whitelighter?

27:31.276 --> 27:32.855
Maybe he doesn't know
she is one.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.172
Right, The Source sends out
his personal assassin,

27:35.272 --> 27:37.270
but doesn't know who he's after?

27:38.108 --> 27:40.485
Is it possible that she didn't know
she's a whitelighter?

27:40.585 --> 27:41.684
No, why?

27:41.784 --> 27:44.242
Because she acted as if she didn't.
She acted just as surprised

27:44.342 --> 27:47.238
- as we were when she orbed out.
- That doesn't make any sense either.

27:47.338 --> 27:50.434
Okay, why don't you go up and ask
the Elders what does make sense

27:50.534 --> 27:52.691
so we don't go
risking our lives again.

27:53.810 --> 27:55.808
I'll be right back.

27:58.645 --> 28:02.080
Maybe I should go to the other side
and see what I can find out.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.217
- No.
- I'll be careful. Nobody will see me.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.374
Besides, it could be good for me
to go back down,

28:07.474 --> 28:09.671
confuse any bounty hunters
that might be trying to track me.

28:10.351 --> 28:11.849
Don't worry.

28:11.949 --> 28:13.946
I won't disappear on you.

28:22.776 --> 28:25.333
Hey, you okay?

28:25.972 --> 28:28.069
Yeah, sure, why not?

28:28.169 --> 28:30.187
We could have another funeral
tomorrow.

28:30.287 --> 28:33.883
I mean, all the dishes are out, and
we pretty much know who to invite.

28:34.203 --> 28:35.581
Piper.

28:35.681 --> 28:38.178
Just tell me one thing.

28:38.278 --> 28:40.675
Are you insane,
or are you just plain stupid?

28:41.314 --> 28:43.012
We buried Prue this morning,

28:43.112 --> 28:46.548
and you go off tonight
and nearly join her.

28:46.867 --> 28:50.044
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- I was trying to save an innocent.

28:50.144 --> 28:52.001
No. You were trying
to get yourself killed,

28:52.101 --> 28:55.618
which is what this family does best,
is get killed.

28:56.616 --> 28:59.912
Isn't it obvious by now
that our only destiny is to die?

29:00.012 --> 29:02.389
And you are making it
way too easy for them, Phoebe.

29:02.489 --> 29:05.086
You are just walking right into it.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.038
I am so sorry.

29:14.156 --> 29:16.613
I cannot handle anything right now,

29:16.713 --> 29:19.709
and I certainly cannot handle
losing another sister.

29:32.693 --> 29:34.691
- Paige.
- Hey.

29:35.490 --> 29:36.828
What happened?

29:36.928 --> 29:39.286
Shane, I feel so bad.
I just got scared and I ran.

29:39.645 --> 29:42.742
- Well, of course.
- Are you all right? What did they say?

29:42.842 --> 29:44.999
It's no big deal,
just a little concussion.

29:45.519 --> 29:48.276
- Oh, no.
- No, I'm gonna be fine.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.451
They wouldn't be releasing me
if I wasn't, right?

29:51.551 --> 29:53.728
I'm just glad you're okay too.

29:53.828 --> 29:55.826
Yeah, well, physically anyway.

29:56.386 --> 29:58.383
Did you talk to the cops yet?

29:59.102 --> 30:02.039
- No, why?
- Why?

30:02.139 --> 30:05.974
They wanna find out who attacked us,
that's why. I told them you saw him.

30:06.774 --> 30:08.811
- You did what?
- Well, you did, didn't you?

30:09.651 --> 30:11.648
Did you?

30:12.326 --> 30:15.123
- Who are you?
- Inspector Cortez, Homicide.

30:15.443 --> 30:17.221
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

30:17.321 --> 30:20.237
Wait, Homicide?
No one was murdered.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.454
Well, based on the m. o., if it's
the same perpetrator I think it was,

30:23.554 --> 30:24.812
that just makes you lucky.

30:24.912 --> 30:27.309
He killed two people
last week, violently.

30:27.789 --> 30:29.986
One of them a young woman
who looked a little bit like you.

30:31.224 --> 30:32.843
Prue.

30:32.943 --> 30:35.740
Prue Halliwell.
Did you know her?

30:36.258 --> 30:38.256
No. No, not really.

30:39.575 --> 30:41.992
Well, in a way you did, right?

30:42.092 --> 30:45.288
What way was that? Were you friends
of hers, a friend of her sisters?

30:46.487 --> 30:48.484
No, not friends.

30:48.924 --> 30:50.981
Then what?

30:51.081 --> 30:53.498
Okay, look. I know
you know something.

30:53.598 --> 30:55.136
I can see it in your eyes.

30:55.236 --> 30:56.975
Just like I know
they know something too.

30:57.075 --> 30:59.950
If you're trying to protect them
in any way, I'll find out.

31:01.749 --> 31:03.986
Well, in that case, they have
nothing to worry about.

31:05.744 --> 31:07.821
You rest up. I'll be back.

31:08.381 --> 31:10.379
Excuse me.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.648
Here, this should help.
It's chamomile.

31:36.748 --> 31:38.745
I had three cups.

31:39.584 --> 31:41.582
Thanks.

31:48.454 --> 31:50.591
Doesn't seem real, does it?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.828
No.

31:52.928 --> 31:55.265
What are we gonna do
with all of her stuff?

31:55.365 --> 31:57.423
And what are we gonna do
with her car?

31:57.523 --> 31:59.420
I don't know.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.298
Sell it, I guess.

32:01.398 --> 32:03.396
- Unless you want it.
- No.

32:07.271 --> 32:09.289
We're gonna get through this,
you know.

32:09.389 --> 32:11.386
We just have to stick together.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.838
- Well?
- Well, they don't know

32:18.938 --> 32:22.214
anything about her,
so she's definitely not a whitelighter.

32:22.533 --> 32:24.511
Then why can she orb, Leo?

32:24.611 --> 32:26.669
They can't explain it.

32:26.769 --> 32:28.806
Wait a minute. How is it possible
that they don't know...?

32:30.404 --> 32:33.341
Sorry I took so long. I had to dodge
a couple of bounty hunters.

32:33.441 --> 32:35.978
- Did you find anything out?
- You have no idea what I found out.

32:36.078 --> 32:38.255
The Source doesn't think
she's a whitelighter at all.

32:38.355 --> 32:40.812
In fact, he thinks she might
be another...

32:40.912 --> 32:43.129
...Charmed One.
That's why he put Shax on it.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.767
He thought he ended
the power of three.

32:44.867 --> 32:47.664
Now he's worried this girl
may somehow reconstitute it.

32:48.223 --> 32:50.081
No, but that's not possible.

32:50.181 --> 32:52.178
Is that possible?

32:54.496 --> 32:56.493
- Piper?
- Piper?

33:01.487 --> 33:02.625
What's going on?

33:02.725 --> 33:05.342
I'm going to ask Grams
what's going on, actually.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.141
Grams?

33:07.241 --> 33:09.139
"Your destiny still awaits," she says.

33:09.239 --> 33:11.136
"There's a reason for everything,"
she says.

33:11.236 --> 33:13.773
So it's time to summon
her transparent butt back here

33:13.873 --> 33:16.250
and find out exactly
what that reason is.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.687
- Okay, Piper, but what makes you...?
- Hear these words

33:18.787 --> 33:21.124
Hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

33:21.224 --> 33:24.580
Come to me, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide

33:27.457 --> 33:30.254
Piper, why are you calling?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.691
Phoebe... What's going on?

33:33.250 --> 33:36.726
Grams, why does The Source think
that the Charmed Ones

33:37.045 --> 33:39.043
can be reconstituted?

33:40.562 --> 33:42.639
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:43.198 --> 33:45.815
You know what, Grams? You were
a lousy liar when you were alive,

33:45.915 --> 33:47.612
and now as a ghost, you're worse.

33:47.712 --> 33:50.169
If you know something, Grams,
you have to tell us.

33:50.269 --> 33:51.688
We deserve to know.

33:51.788 --> 33:54.605
I can't. I'm sworn to secrecy.

33:54.705 --> 33:56.403
By who?

33:56.503 --> 33:58.500
By me.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.772
By me.

34:05.092 --> 34:07.090
Mom?

34:10.485 --> 34:12.504
You can't just walk in here like this.

34:12.603 --> 34:15.620
- Search warrant says I can.
- What the hell are you looking for?

34:15.719 --> 34:18.636
Do you really expect me to believe
you don't know, inspector?

34:19.395 --> 34:21.753
Follow me.
And keep your voice down.

34:23.830 --> 34:26.447
We didn't tell anybody
because we were afraid

34:26.547 --> 34:28.804
that there would be reprisals,

34:28.904 --> 34:34.658
afraid that you girls would be denied
your powers, your birthright.

34:37.215 --> 34:39.951
It happened after your father
and I were divorced,

34:40.051 --> 34:42.628
when Sam and I were together.

34:42.728 --> 34:43.987
Sam?

34:44.087 --> 34:46.103
Her whitelighter.

34:46.204 --> 34:48.761
Apples don't fall far
from the forbidden tree, I see.

34:50.998 --> 34:52.696
Go on.

34:52.795 --> 34:55.172
You were both toddlers.

34:55.273 --> 34:58.350
You just thought Mommy
got a little fat.

35:00.387 --> 35:02.285
You never knew I was pregnant.

35:02.385 --> 35:05.402
- I was the only one who knew.
- And Sam, obviously.

35:05.502 --> 35:07.499
Well, yes, of course.

35:10.296 --> 35:12.293
We wanted to keep the baby...

35:12.733 --> 35:15.190
...of course, but Mother...

35:15.290 --> 35:18.466
Well I... I knew it would be
disastrous.

35:18.566 --> 35:22.481
You know, before you and Leo,
Piper, it wasn't just forbidden,

35:22.840 --> 35:25.537
it was unthinkable for witches
to be with whitelighters,

35:25.637 --> 35:28.014
I mean, let alone have children
with them.

35:28.114 --> 35:30.052
So that's why we had to...

35:30.152 --> 35:33.029
- Why we decided...
- Yes.

35:33.628 --> 35:35.626
...to give the baby up.

35:36.025 --> 35:40.020
Sam and I took her to a local church
as soon as she was born.

35:40.700 --> 35:45.254
And we asked the nun there
to find a home for her.

35:46.253 --> 35:48.431
And she found one,
a very, very good home.

35:48.531 --> 35:49.629
Yes.

35:49.729 --> 35:52.326
Explains why the Elders
didn't know about her.

35:53.046 --> 35:55.841
All right, hold it.
Wait just one minute.

35:56.161 --> 36:01.155
Are you telling me that that girl,
our innocent, is really...

36:05.670 --> 36:07.448
...our sister?

36:07.548 --> 36:09.446
Your baby sister.

36:09.546 --> 36:12.822
- Their baby half-sister.
- But by my half,

36:13.141 --> 36:15.119
which makes her a sister witch.

36:15.219 --> 36:16.956
Well, actually, not yet anyway.

36:17.056 --> 36:20.573
Not until all three of you
are here together by the book,

36:20.972 --> 36:22.590
just like before.

36:22.690 --> 36:24.827
Charmed...

36:24.927 --> 36:26.925
...again.

36:28.044 --> 36:30.042
And I thought my family
was screwed up.

36:38.871 --> 36:40.868
Well, I'll be damned.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.659
Darryl, do something.

36:49.219 --> 36:52.216
He's a cop, Piper.
And he's got a search warrant.

36:52.534 --> 36:55.651
And believe me, I've found
what I've been searching for.

36:58.208 --> 37:00.206
Don't move. I'll shoot.

37:00.965 --> 37:03.262
- And so will I.
- Cole.

37:03.362 --> 37:05.400
Okay, inspector,
just put the gun down.

37:05.999 --> 37:09.994
There is a very good explanation
for all of this.

37:11.113 --> 37:13.171
Feel free to chime in
anytime, guys.

37:13.271 --> 37:15.708
My whole life, I suspected
evil magic was real.

37:16.346 --> 37:18.524
That there was something more.

37:18.624 --> 37:21.900
I've seen too many horrible things
in the job to suspect otherwise.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.257
Not the least of which are
the two murders that happened here.

37:25.775 --> 37:28.892
- Wait, are you accusing us...?
- I've just begun to accuse you, lady!

37:29.651 --> 37:33.686
All right, fine, you caught us.
Congratulations.

37:34.006 --> 37:36.103
So, what are you going
to do about it? Shoot us?

37:36.203 --> 37:38.920
Easy, Grams. Not all of us
are dead, remember?

37:39.240 --> 37:41.777
All right, look. You can't arrest us.
Especially not them.

37:41.877 --> 37:44.893
- Nobody will ever believe you.
- Maybe not at first.

37:44.993 --> 37:47.330
I'm putting this whole place
under constant surveillance.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.889
I'm taping your every move.

37:48.989 --> 37:52.824
Sooner or later, I'll catch you
doing something supernatural.

37:53.463 --> 37:55.461
And then...

37:58.138 --> 38:00.135
Think you've been through
enough today, huh?

38:00.975 --> 38:02.592
Thank you.

38:02.692 --> 38:06.887
Darryl, go, get out of here. We don't
want you to take the fall for this.

38:07.247 --> 38:08.585
No. It's okay.

38:08.685 --> 38:12.441
No, it's not. This is our problem.
He wants to expose us, not you.

38:12.761 --> 38:14.758
Let us take care of this. Please?

38:18.353 --> 38:21.470
If you need me, you know
where to find me, huh?

38:25.625 --> 38:28.802
Doesn't solve your problem.
He's gonna wake up eventually.

38:28.902 --> 38:30.879
You just bought yourself some time.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.936
Which you're gonna need,
especially if you wanna save your...

38:34.375 --> 38:36.153
Sister?

38:36.253 --> 38:38.850
Well, what are you waiting for?
Just write a spell. Get rid of him.

38:39.488 --> 38:40.668
Get rid of him?

38:40.768 --> 38:44.323
Well, you know what I mean.
Dump him somewhere. Anywhere.

38:44.683 --> 38:46.980
With all the witches in this room,
we ought to be able

38:47.080 --> 38:49.357
to do something with him.
I mean, just start rhyming.

38:50.116 --> 38:55.271
Take him back, take him away
Remove him now, don't let him stay

38:57.268 --> 39:01.903
We call the spirits to help undo

39:02.302 --> 39:05.418
And send him off to...

39:07.177 --> 39:09.174
...Timbuktu

39:11.371 --> 39:14.168
Whoa, it worked.

39:15.646 --> 39:18.843
Timbuktu? You sent him
to Timbuktu?

39:19.162 --> 39:22.918
All right, well, it was the only thing I
could think of that rhymed with "undo. "

39:23.357 --> 39:25.994
Don't worry. I'll... I'll find him.

39:27.592 --> 39:31.627
Okay, well, this is way too much
for me to handle. Way too much.

39:31.987 --> 39:34.644
Nobody can blame you
for being angry, sweetie.

39:34.744 --> 39:37.840
Angry? Yeah, I'm angry.
I'm confused.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.277
And you know what?
This... This is just crazy.

39:40.377 --> 39:42.794
You cannot float in here
after all these years

39:42.894 --> 39:46.130
and go, "Oh, gosh, I forgot.
By the way, you've got a sister. "

39:46.450 --> 39:48.447
Especially not today of all days.

39:49.447 --> 39:51.344
I know it's a lot, sweetie,

39:51.444 --> 39:53.222
more than anybody
should have to deal with.

39:53.322 --> 39:55.859
But you're going to have
to deal with it.

39:55.959 --> 39:58.056
The best way you know how.

39:58.156 --> 40:02.231
Losing Prue,
learning about another sister...

40:03.110 --> 40:06.167
...this is your path.
It's your destiny.

40:06.267 --> 40:09.782
Get angry at it, cry about it,
but don't fight it,

40:10.621 --> 40:12.979
or it'll consume you.

40:14.457 --> 40:16.454
Come on, Patty.

40:17.293 --> 40:19.291
The rest is up to them.

40:29.759 --> 40:33.035
I can't sense where she is because
she's technically not a witch yet.

40:33.354 --> 40:36.131
All right, so all we have to go on
is that church that Mom mentioned

40:36.231 --> 40:38.488
- and the nun.
- Let's just get one thing straight:

40:38.588 --> 40:40.006
I am only doing this to save her.

40:40.106 --> 40:43.423
I'm not remotely interested
in reconstituting...

40:45.180 --> 40:46.679
...the Charmed Ones.

40:46.779 --> 40:50.215
I... The door was open.

40:51.094 --> 40:52.752
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here.

40:52.852 --> 40:54.869
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

40:54.969 --> 40:57.186
We were just coming to look for you.

40:57.286 --> 40:59.663
- You were?
- Yep.

40:59.763 --> 41:02.300
Come on in. Welcome. I'm Phoebe.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.157
- And this is...
- Piper.

41:06.315 --> 41:09.632
I know. I've been to your club.
It's pretty great.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.828
Thank you. And you are...?

41:13.947 --> 41:16.304
Paige. My name is Paige.

41:17.783 --> 41:19.780
Another P. Imagine that.

41:22.896 --> 41:24.894
It's nice to meet you.

41:40.555 --> 41:43.172
Okay. What was that?

41:43.272 --> 41:45.470
I think that means
you're supposed to be here.

41:58.334 --> 42:00.811
- Run! Get upstairs!
- Leo!

42:11.599 --> 42:13.656
What are we doing?
What is that thing?

42:13.756 --> 42:15.854
We'll explain later.

42:15.954 --> 42:19.030
Okay, just say this spell
out loud with us, okay?

42:19.390 --> 42:22.426
- Spell? What are you guys, witches?
- And so are you, we hope.

42:23.185 --> 42:25.183
Well, we're about to find out.

42:28.059 --> 42:30.756
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

42:30.856 --> 42:34.771
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

42:46.837 --> 42:48.835
It's not enough.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.712
Shax was just the messenger.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.587
- We gotta get The Source.
- The source of what?

42:58.024 --> 43:00.021
Of all evil.

43:03.817 --> 43:06.294
What have you guys
turned me into?

43:08.452 --> 43:10.449
- Paige.
- Wait.

43:16.642 --> 43:20.078
My assassin failed.
The witch is alive.

43:20.398 --> 43:22.815
Yes, I know.

43:22.915 --> 43:25.931
You told me her future
was short-lived.

43:26.031 --> 43:27.449
You told me...

43:27.549 --> 43:31.065
I told you only that it appeared
to be short-lived.

43:31.864 --> 43:34.321
Seeing into the future
is not always exact,

43:34.421 --> 43:36.758
especially when magical forces
are at play.

43:36.858 --> 43:40.334
The power of three is strong.
She'll be almost untouchable

43:40.653 --> 43:43.230
now that she's united
with her new sisters.

43:43.330 --> 43:45.748
Once the bond is formed perhaps.

43:45.848 --> 43:48.225
But it has yet to.

43:48.325 --> 43:50.702
Which means she's vulnerable,

43:50.802 --> 43:53.239
easily swayed.

43:57.194 --> 43:59.291
Forty-eight little hours.

43:59.391 --> 44:02.508
The window of opportunity agreed to
eons ago by both sides

44:02.828 --> 44:04.365
to protect free will.

44:04.465 --> 44:06.683
The great flaw in the grand design.

44:06.783 --> 44:09.040
She hasn't chosen
the other side yet.

44:09.140 --> 44:11.477
Well, she's young, confused.

44:11.577 --> 44:14.114
Doesn't know which way to turn.

44:14.214 --> 44:17.610
You must seduce her
into using her powers for evil.

44:17.930 --> 44:21.246
Then she will become evil.
And that's even better than killing her.

44:21.565 --> 44:23.803
Which, of course, you could still do.

44:24.442 --> 44:26.500
You need to get close to her.

44:26.600 --> 44:32.312
Read her soul, corrupt it,
and she's yours.

44:32.712 --> 44:34.251
And, you.

44:34.351 --> 44:38.865
You need to see the future
more clearly, Oracle...

44:40.423 --> 44:43.860
...for your own future.

45:18.059 --> 45:20.456
What the hell? Who are you?

45:21.175 --> 45:24.212
For now, I am you.

45:41.831 --> 45:44.987
Oh, my God, the most horrible thing
just happened to me.

45:45.786 --> 45:47.684
I can't explain...

45:47.784 --> 45:50.900
It's okay, honey. I'm here now.

45:56.654 --> 45:58.651
It's okay.

46:04.683 --> 46:07.800
I don't understand how you
can keep healing innocents

46:08.120 --> 46:09.977
but you can't figure out a way
to heal yourself.

46:10.077 --> 46:13.194
Well, it's kind of hard to heal myself
when I'm knocked out.

46:13.514 --> 46:16.709
Leo, how's it possible for an angel
to even get knocked out?

46:17.029 --> 46:19.286
I mean, you are, after all,
technically dead.

46:19.386 --> 46:21.444
Three years together,
and now you're asking questions?

46:21.544 --> 46:24.241
Well, I think the more
appropriate question

46:24.341 --> 46:27.497
is how does a whitelighter
get somebody knocked up?

46:28.415 --> 46:31.692
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, what do you think it means?

46:32.451 --> 46:35.427
If this is about Paige,
I swear the Elders had no idea

46:35.527 --> 46:38.104
that she even existed.
Or that she was your sister.

46:38.204 --> 46:41.341
- Sister witch.
- Half witch, half whitelighter.

46:41.441 --> 46:43.178
Let's not forget that little surprise.

46:43.278 --> 46:47.114
I still can't believe that Mom
kept that a secret from us.

46:47.433 --> 46:49.810
Well, it sounded like she didn't
have much of a choice.

46:49.910 --> 46:51.769
We're her daughters.
She could have found a way

46:51.869 --> 46:54.306
to share that information with us.

46:55.824 --> 46:58.900
That better not be another
long-lost relative.

47:03.535 --> 47:05.772
- Hi, Piper.
- Hi there.

47:08.529 --> 47:11.065
- Where's Cortez?
- Who?

47:11.165 --> 47:14.002
Inspector Cortez,
the one I hit over the head.

47:14.482 --> 47:17.138
The one you said you would
take care of. He's missing.

47:17.238 --> 47:20.714
Police inspectors are not supposed
to be missing. Where is he?

47:21.034 --> 47:24.590
- Well, I kind of sent him to...
- Timbuktu.

47:24.910 --> 47:26.907
It rhymed with "undo. "

47:27.347 --> 47:28.605
Timbuktu.

47:28.705 --> 47:30.982
- It's okay. Cole went to get him.
- Cole?

47:33.060 --> 47:35.057
- Cole.
- Wait.

47:46.085 --> 47:48.122
Damn bounty hunters.
They're like gnats.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.499
Where's the inspector?

47:50.599 --> 47:52.417
Don't worry, I found him.
Moved him to a place

47:52.517 --> 47:55.992
he can't tell a soul what he saw.
Literally.

47:56.312 --> 47:58.549
What do you mean?
Where did you put him?

48:01.346 --> 48:02.525
In the basement?

48:02.625 --> 48:04.942
No, I think he means
a little bit further down than that.

48:06.340 --> 48:08.837
Cole, he's a cop.
He's one of the good guys.

48:08.937 --> 48:10.835
He's also the one who can
expose them as witches.

48:10.935 --> 48:13.792
I'd think that you, above anybody,
would want to avoid that at all costs.

48:13.892 --> 48:15.929
Not at that cost.
We have to save him.

48:17.287 --> 48:20.164
Save him? What do you mean,
save him? What...? What's going on?

48:20.484 --> 48:22.941
You know what? We are gonna
take care of this whole mess.

48:23.041 --> 48:25.258
- Wait a sec, hold...
- You don't worry about it.

48:25.358 --> 48:26.497
All right.

48:26.597 --> 48:30.552
Okay, maybe you can talk
to the inspector, reason with him.

48:30.912 --> 48:32.929
And what if he can't?
What if you two get exposed?

48:33.029 --> 48:35.906
What's to say the same thing won't
happen to you that happened to Prue?

48:37.863 --> 48:39.361
Well, it's a risk we'll have to take.

48:39.461 --> 48:41.958
You know what, there's another risk
you guys have to worry about.

48:42.058 --> 48:43.916
On the way back, I heard gargoyles.

48:44.016 --> 48:46.952
Gargoyles? You mean,
like, statues?

48:47.052 --> 48:50.069
That's only in their resting state.
They come alive to ward off evil.

48:50.169 --> 48:52.825
In this case, I think they're trying
to ward off The Source.

48:52.925 --> 48:54.924
I think he's surfaced.

48:55.282 --> 48:57.061
Wait, what?

48:57.161 --> 48:59.857
He's here? Now? Where?

48:59.957 --> 49:02.654
I don't know. Could be anywhere.
Or anyone.

49:02.754 --> 49:04.452
He probably came for Paige.

49:04.552 --> 49:06.690
But she doesn't stand a chance
against him.

49:06.790 --> 49:08.487
She doesn't even know
what her power is yet.

49:08.587 --> 49:11.564
Leo, we don't stand a chance
against him.

49:11.664 --> 49:13.561
Not without Prue.

49:13.661 --> 49:15.659
But you might with Paige.
The new power of three.

49:16.857 --> 49:18.914
Can you sense her?

49:19.014 --> 49:20.753
I don't think so. She's too new.

49:20.853 --> 49:23.689
Well, then we just have to start with
the church Mom was talking about.

49:24.208 --> 49:25.866
- Piper...
- What? Phoebe,

49:25.966 --> 49:29.203
I'm not crazy about it either,
but we can't just do nothing. Not now.

49:29.522 --> 49:31.540
Mom wouldn't want us to.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.637
And neither would Prue.

49:47.421 --> 49:50.397
Oscar, what's the matter,
sweetheart?

49:50.497 --> 49:52.655
It's okay, I'm home.

49:53.974 --> 49:55.592
Maybe he doesn't like me.

49:55.692 --> 49:58.129
Don't be ridiculous.
He's always liked you.

50:01.285 --> 50:04.241
Well, aren't you gonna tell me
what happened last night?

50:04.561 --> 50:07.118
No, it's nothing.

50:07.837 --> 50:11.592
Seemed like something to me.
You were pretty scared.

50:12.352 --> 50:14.769
Let's just say that when I wanted
to find out who I was,

50:14.869 --> 50:17.566
I didn't want to find out
I was a freak.

50:17.666 --> 50:20.542
- Can we just talk about this later?
- Of course.

50:21.661 --> 50:23.658
Hey...

50:23.978 --> 50:27.494
...I never got a chance to thank you
for taking such good care of me.

50:32.608 --> 50:34.606
Oscar.

50:36.324 --> 50:37.742
Listen, I should get to work anyway.

50:37.842 --> 50:40.798
I'm in enough trouble with the boss
as it is.

50:48.709 --> 50:50.487
Well, I know how badly
you want to be there

50:50.587 --> 50:52.584
for that placement hearing.

50:54.662 --> 50:58.258
- How did you know about that?
- Well, you told me, remember?

51:00.056 --> 51:02.553
Little boy, abusive dad.

51:02.653 --> 51:05.130
You said nothing gets under
your skin more than that.

51:07.247 --> 51:09.245
Right, okay.

51:10.084 --> 51:13.220
Make yourself at home.
Stop by for lunch if you feel up to it.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.317
Count on it.

51:29.580 --> 51:32.377
Help me!

51:39.689 --> 51:41.806
You. Stay away from me!

51:42.286 --> 51:44.383
- Stay away!
- We're here to save you.

51:44.483 --> 51:48.158
- You're the one who put me here!
- No, no. Actually, that was just me.

51:48.478 --> 51:50.615
Hoping you'd change your mind
about the girls. Have you?

51:50.715 --> 51:53.412
Killing me is the only way
to keep me from trying to stop you!

51:53.512 --> 51:55.510
We're not gonna kill you, inspector.

51:56.389 --> 51:59.326
But what you don't understand
is that by exposing the girls,

51:59.426 --> 52:01.283
you're not stopping evil,
you're helping it.

52:01.383 --> 52:03.381
Oh, yeah, right.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.737
You do understand
that if we take him back, it's over.

52:08.015 --> 52:10.972
I'll lose Phoebe.
And you'll lose Piper.

52:16.486 --> 52:18.683
- Take my hand.
- No.

52:19.642 --> 52:21.419
Take my hand.

52:21.519 --> 52:24.196
Where else can I take you
that's worse than this?

52:40.697 --> 52:42.674
- So how's Aunt Julie?
- Much better.

52:42.774 --> 52:45.031
- Yeah?
- Thank you, dear, for asking.

52:45.131 --> 52:47.130
Is her hip any better?

52:48.807 --> 52:51.384
Jake and Carol Grisanti
for Mr. Cowan?

52:51.484 --> 52:53.522
Okay. I'll let him know you're here.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.896
I'm sorry. Say that again.
I got distracted.

52:57.996 --> 53:00.354
He'll be with you in a few minutes.

53:02.031 --> 53:04.029
I'm gonna go wash up, all right?

53:17.574 --> 53:19.571
What do you want?

53:21.729 --> 53:23.726
Oh, God.

53:37.510 --> 53:38.609
Hey, before you go,

53:38.709 --> 53:40.486
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

53:40.586 --> 53:43.363
Do you guys still go to that church
that Mom and Dad used to go to?

53:43.463 --> 53:45.840
- Yeah, we still go.
- Is there still a nun

53:45.940 --> 53:47.678
called Sister Agnes there?

53:47.778 --> 53:51.613
- Isn't she the one who found you?
- Yeah, right, the one that found me.

53:51.973 --> 53:54.590
- Have you spoken to her?
- No, no, I haven't spoken to her,

53:54.690 --> 53:56.687
but something's come up.
I think I should.

53:59.404 --> 54:01.301
Uncle Dave, I gotta go.
I'll call you back, okay?

54:01.401 --> 54:03.519
- Okay, I love you, Paige.
- Yeah, I love you too.

54:05.118 --> 54:08.353
- Mr. Cowan.
- Hey, look, Paige, I got this, okay?

54:08.673 --> 54:11.010
But you can't let that little boy
go home with that jerk.

54:11.110 --> 54:14.267
Paige, number one, you don't know
for a fact he's abusing the boy.

54:14.586 --> 54:16.784
And number two,
this is none of your business.

54:17.263 --> 54:19.201
You are an assistant,
not a social worker.

54:19.301 --> 54:22.177
That's because you're too cheap
to make me one.

54:38.598 --> 54:41.154
Phoebe, I think I found the...

54:43.512 --> 54:45.510
The church.

54:52.142 --> 54:54.140
Phoebe?

55:01.611 --> 55:03.608
What are you doing in here?

55:06.765 --> 55:09.521
You remember the time I borrowed
this from Prue without asking her?

55:10.960 --> 55:12.957
Which time?

55:13.317 --> 55:15.554
When my boyfriend's cat peed on it.

55:17.872 --> 55:22.306
She got so mad, I thought
she was gonna have a stroke.

55:23.465 --> 55:25.663
But the funny thing was...

55:27.101 --> 55:29.038
...she got mad at you,

55:29.138 --> 55:31.855
because she thought that you
were the one that borrowed it.

55:34.492 --> 55:36.849
And you never told her the truth.

55:40.844 --> 55:42.842
She never knew it was really me.

55:53.070 --> 55:55.427
I miss her so much.

55:56.147 --> 55:58.244
I know.

55:58.344 --> 56:00.341
Me too.

56:02.859 --> 56:06.295
I was wondering
when you were gonna let go.

56:08.692 --> 56:11.808
I was just... I was trying to... Thanks.

56:12.247 --> 56:17.441
...stay strong, you know,
keep it together for you.

56:17.841 --> 56:23.034
And then I put all my energy
into trying to save Paige

56:23.434 --> 56:26.710
because I figured only one of us
could break down at a time.

56:27.030 --> 56:29.148
Otherwise we'd both be useless.

56:30.426 --> 56:32.663
I'm scared, Piper.

56:34.422 --> 56:37.218
I am really, really scared.

56:37.777 --> 56:40.414
She always took the lead.
She was...

56:42.452 --> 56:44.449
She was our big sister.

56:45.448 --> 56:48.005
How are we supposed to go on
without her?

56:49.803 --> 56:53.639
How are we supposed to go up
against The Source without her?

56:58.354 --> 57:00.351
I don't know.

57:01.229 --> 57:05.425
But I do know that we can't let
the bastard get Paige either.

57:06.264 --> 57:09.980
So no matter what we think or feel,
she is our sister.

57:11.897 --> 57:13.895
And sisters protect each other.

57:22.764 --> 57:24.502
- What's happening?
- Nothing's been decided.

57:24.602 --> 57:26.979
- We're gonna meet again tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

57:27.079 --> 57:28.857
You can't let him go home
with that kid.

57:28.957 --> 57:30.575
I can and I am.

57:30.675 --> 57:32.932
Look, Paige, you weren't in there.
He was very persuasive.

57:33.032 --> 57:35.170
Persuasive? What about
the police report?

57:35.270 --> 57:36.927
What about the counsellor's
recommendations?

57:37.027 --> 57:39.364
Look, Paige, I know
how you feel about these cases.

57:39.464 --> 57:41.881
But we can't make a decision
based on what you think.

57:41.981 --> 57:44.598
We have to base it on fact.
Right now, we don't have enough yet.

57:44.698 --> 57:46.696
I'm sorry.

57:48.015 --> 57:50.012
You got a problem, lady?

57:50.332 --> 57:52.749
Yeah, I do. I got a problem
with people who hit their kids.

57:52.849 --> 57:55.465
- Come on, Jake, let's just go.
- Wait, wait.

57:55.565 --> 57:57.962
Listen, I can do
whatever the hell I want to...

58:01.399 --> 58:04.116
...and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

58:15.382 --> 58:17.939
- Where do you think you're going?
- Church.

58:21.854 --> 58:25.131
Can you give me a hand?
I think that he must have slipped.

59:21.024 --> 59:22.803
Excuse me?

59:22.903 --> 59:26.298
- Are you Sister Agnes?
- Yes.

59:26.618 --> 59:30.055
- And who might you be?
- I'm Paige. Paige Matthews.

59:33.690 --> 59:34.948
You might not remember me.

59:35.048 --> 59:38.244
I probably changed a little bit
since you last saw me

59:38.564 --> 59:41.241
on August 2nd, 1977.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.278
Does that ring any bells?

59:47.673 --> 59:49.671
Oh, dear Lord.

59:55.744 --> 01:00:00.139
I was just about your age
when they came.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.636
They?

01:00:02.736 --> 01:00:04.713
My mother and my father?

01:00:04.813 --> 01:00:10.407
They came in a swirl
of bright white lights, just like...

01:00:11.565 --> 01:00:13.563
...angels.

01:00:13.882 --> 01:00:15.880
White lights? What do you mean?

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:20.355
Well, that's how they appeared,
with you in their arms.

01:00:21.434 --> 01:00:23.831
I was stunned.
I didn't know what to think.

01:00:25.629 --> 01:00:28.246
They said you were in great danger.

01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:31.742
That they had no other choice
but to give you up

01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.959
to protect you.

01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:38.374
- Danger? What kind of danger?
- Well, they didn't say.

01:00:39.172 --> 01:00:42.249
But I could tell from their pain
that it must be very real.

01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:46.704
They asked me to find you
a good home,

01:00:46.804 --> 01:00:48.661
a safe home,

01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:51.438
and to keep their secret...

01:00:53.635 --> 01:00:55.633
...until you came looking.

01:00:56.033 --> 01:00:58.030
But how could they know?

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:01.027
Because you come from them,
my dear.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:06.700
As wonderful and precious
as your adoptive parents were to you...

01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:09.856
...you still come from angels.

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:17.567
They asked me to save this for you
for this day.

01:01:18.726 --> 01:01:20.724
It's what they bundled you up in.

01:01:22.961 --> 01:01:25.418
Your mother had only one request:

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.835
That your name begin with a P.

01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.610
- Yes, may I help you?
- Hi.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.967
Hey, what's up?
We need to get you out of here.

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:36.765
What did you do to her?

01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:38.402
Oh, she just froze her.
She'll be fine.

01:01:38.502 --> 01:01:41.859
Yeah, lucky I didn't blow her up.
My powers have been a little off lately.

01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:44.176
Piper.

01:01:46.054 --> 01:01:48.271
- Is that our blanket?
- No, that's mine.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.989
- Leave me alone.
- All right, jeez.

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:51.228
Paige.

01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:53.325
Paige.

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:56.502
Paige.

01:01:56.602 --> 01:01:59.059
- Stop, or I'll freeze.
- She's a witch, you can't freeze her.

01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:02.174
- She doesn't know that.
- Will you please just leave me alone.

01:02:02.274 --> 01:02:03.893
Look, we know
what you're going through.

01:02:03.993 --> 01:02:06.929
We went through the same thing when
we first found out we were witches too.

01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:10.585
Look, you just gotta trust us.
Somebody very, very bad is after you.

01:02:12.223 --> 01:02:13.960
Trust you? You just froze a nun.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.719
How do I know
you're not the bad ones?

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.795
- Well, if we are, then you are, sister.
- Piper.

01:02:18.895 --> 01:02:21.372
What? Fine, then you try.

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.169
You have a magical power,
you know.

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:31.460
At least, if you're really
a Charmed One, you do.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.357
And the sooner you learn it, the sooner
you'll be able to protect yourself.

01:02:36.315 --> 01:02:39.211
- I have a power?
- According to the prophecy,

01:02:39.311 --> 01:02:42.467
the third sister has the power
to move things with her mind.

01:02:42.787 --> 01:02:44.784
Like Prue could.

01:02:46.703 --> 01:02:50.158
- How does it work?
- You concentrate on an object,

01:02:50.258 --> 01:02:52.256
like that candle right there.

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:56.052
And then you just wave your arm
at it.

01:03:01.205 --> 01:03:05.481
Or you could squint your eyes.
She used to squint her eyes.

01:03:08.796 --> 01:03:11.473
Maybe I'm not one of you after all
if I can't even make that candle...

01:03:19.104 --> 01:03:24.218
So perhaps the whitelighter
in her makes it work differently?

01:03:24.658 --> 01:03:26.656
Half-breed.

01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:31.749
She better be here, Oracle.

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:35.125
- I'm running out of time.
- She is. Don't worry.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.516
No!

01:03:46.352 --> 01:03:48.090
What is that?

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:50.188
I don't know.

01:03:51.066 --> 01:03:53.303
- Paige.
- Shane?

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.237
What's the matter?
My God, what happened?

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:00.875
I don't know. Something's after me.

01:04:00.975 --> 01:04:02.114
- Paige.
- Paige.

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:04.611
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Paige, come back!

01:04:10.204 --> 01:04:14.160
- What the hell was that?
- Good question.

01:04:22.869 --> 01:04:25.046
Look, we didn't have
to bring you back, you know.

01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:26.364
We could have just let you rot.

01:04:26.464 --> 01:04:28.941
- Cole, I don't think this is helping any.
- Like your way is.

01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:31.278
Cortez, where you been?

01:04:31.378 --> 01:04:33.876
- Operations.
- This is Inspector Cortez.

01:04:33.976 --> 01:04:35.993
I need a surveillance team,
round the clock.

01:04:36.093 --> 01:04:38.150
- I'll take one shift.
- What are you doing?

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.508
What I said I'd do
before you clipped me from behind.

01:04:40.608 --> 01:04:42.546
You're making a big mistake,
inspector.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.643
You have no idea what you're doing.

01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:47.500
- You wanna bet?
- Something's wrong.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.598
Piper's calling.

01:04:50.996 --> 01:04:53.213
Just so you know,

01:04:53.313 --> 01:04:56.290
whatever pain you put Phoebe
through because of what you're doing

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:59.405
will be nothing compared
to the pain I put you through.

01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:01.504
You understand?

01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:04.719
Cortez, you there?
What's the address?

01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:07.616
1329 Prescott Street.

01:05:08.415 --> 01:05:10.593
Phoebe and Piper Halliwell.

01:05:10.693 --> 01:05:12.111
They're murder suspects.

01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:13.708
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

01:05:13.808 --> 01:05:15.807
Come on. Come on.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:19.362
- I got four guys who can do it.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:23.437
- Hey, listen, Cortez.
- Let go of me.

01:05:25.196 --> 01:05:26.574
You make me sick.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.851
How long have you been
covering up for them, huh?

01:05:28.951 --> 01:05:32.666
How many other murders have
you ignored just to protect them?

01:05:32.986 --> 01:05:35.303
You're a disgrace to that shield,
my friend.

01:05:36.102 --> 01:05:39.459
You think this is the first time
I have risked my career for those girls?

01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:41.896
My life, my family?

01:05:42.215 --> 01:05:44.033
They're the best people
I've ever met.

01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:46.151
They'll do more good
than you'll ever know.

01:05:46.251 --> 01:05:48.768
- And it cost them their sister.
- Hey, hey, inspector, ease up.

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:52.043
- You all right?
- I'm good, I'm good.

01:05:52.643 --> 01:05:54.640
Yeah.

01:05:56.758 --> 01:05:58.377
So The Source was there
at the church?

01:05:58.477 --> 01:06:01.512
Well, the gargoyles weren't
exactly whistling "Dixie," Leo.

01:06:01.912 --> 01:06:05.049
Plus, something pretty powerful
knocked us on our asses.

01:06:05.149 --> 01:06:07.526
But if he was there,
why didn't he try to kill Paige?

01:06:07.626 --> 01:06:09.743
Maybe he didn't want to go up
against the Charmed Ones.

01:06:10.223 --> 01:06:13.218
No, it doesn't make sense. He knows
that Paige is new to her powers.

01:06:13.538 --> 01:06:15.675
If ever there was a time to attack...

01:06:15.775 --> 01:06:17.773
Wait a minute.

01:06:18.492 --> 01:06:20.989
What if he's not trying
to kill her anymore?

01:06:21.089 --> 01:06:23.087
What if he's trying to lure her
to his side?

01:06:25.484 --> 01:06:26.863
Translation, please?

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:29.420
- The mythological window.
- There's a window of opportunity,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.458
- an opening.
- Forty-eight hours.

01:06:31.558 --> 01:06:34.513
Right, 48 hours where
a nascent witch who hasn't chosen

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:38.429
to use her power for good or evil yet
can be swayed either way.

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:40.966
Wait, so all he has to do
is cast a spell on her?

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:44.042
No, he can't. It has to be her choice,

01:06:44.142 --> 01:06:46.219
but he can tempt her, entice her.

01:06:47.538 --> 01:06:49.476
If he gets her to use
her powers for evil...

01:06:49.576 --> 01:06:51.573
She becomes evil forever.

01:06:52.653 --> 01:06:54.650
Who makes up
these cockamamie rules?

01:06:57.527 --> 01:06:58.785
Oh, never mind.

01:06:58.885 --> 01:07:02.081
Okay, so we have less
than 24 hours to get to Paige

01:07:02.401 --> 01:07:04.419
and no idea how to find her.

01:07:04.519 --> 01:07:06.516
But I'll bet The Source does.

01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:11.710
Here.

01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:14.467
Thanks.

01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:20.380
I'm so sorry to involve you in all this.

01:07:20.699 --> 01:07:22.717
All of what?

01:07:22.817 --> 01:07:24.874
Paige...

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.972
...what's going on?

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:29.788
I don't know.

01:07:29.888 --> 01:07:32.425
I'm so confused.
I don't know what to do.

01:07:32.525 --> 01:07:34.523
Hey.

01:07:34.923 --> 01:07:36.900
You don't have to know.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.997
You're safe here...

01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:41.634
...with me.

01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:48.386
I'll take care of you.

01:07:57.655 --> 01:08:00.032
Sure you don't want me
to turn Belthazor loose on Cortez,

01:08:00.132 --> 01:08:01.272
just for a minute or two?

01:08:01.372 --> 01:08:04.407
No. He doesn't have anything
on the girls yet.

01:08:04.727 --> 01:08:08.083
Besides, now is no time to be blurring
the line between good and evil.

01:08:08.723 --> 01:08:10.960
This is useless.

01:08:12.878 --> 01:08:16.073
We're never gonna find Paige
without a little help.

01:08:21.108 --> 01:08:23.585
Works every time.

01:08:24.783 --> 01:08:26.640
Okay, an enchantment spell.

01:08:26.741 --> 01:08:28.439
Wait, how is this
gonna help us find her?

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:33.093
Well, maybe it's not to find Paige.
Maybe it's so we can ID The Source.

01:08:33.453 --> 01:08:36.729
See the last line? It's,
"So she can reveal the evil within. "

01:08:37.049 --> 01:08:39.307
But that'll only help
if we can find him.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.184
Maybe we can.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.602
Or at least, maybe you can.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.077
What does he mean?

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:51.930
Demons can sense
The Source's aura.

01:08:52.031 --> 01:08:56.626
It's how he reminds us of his power,
his reach.

01:08:56.984 --> 01:08:58.684
Maybe if I focused on it...

01:08:58.783 --> 01:09:01.740
Then he'll know you're doing it,
and he'll find you.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.057
Not if I was careful.

01:09:05.536 --> 01:09:08.093
It's your only chance
at saving your sister.

01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:12.368
Okay, so we need something
to enchant.

01:09:13.126 --> 01:09:15.125
Right.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.497
- How about these?
- Oh, Phoebe.

01:09:21.596 --> 01:09:24.073
- What? They're perfect.
- All right.

01:09:24.992 --> 01:09:29.388
Magic forces, far and wide
Enchant these so those can't hide

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:34.102
Allow this witch to use their ends
So she can reveal the evil within

01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:41.932
Okay, better test them.

01:09:46.447 --> 01:09:49.124
- Well?
- Nothing. You look the same.

01:09:50.122 --> 01:09:52.121
How about me?

01:09:53.997 --> 01:09:55.996
What?

01:09:56.755 --> 01:09:58.533
What do I look like?

01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:00.630
You look like hell.

01:10:02.947 --> 01:10:04.946
Enchanting.

01:10:05.944 --> 01:10:08.361
Thanks for the magical assist,
Grams.

01:10:08.461 --> 01:10:10.699
How do you know
it wasn't somebody else?

01:10:33.193 --> 01:10:35.090
You know who you are now, Paige.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.047
This is where your destiny lies.

01:10:38.147 --> 01:10:40.743
It lies not with your sister witches.

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:44.119
It's for no one but you.

01:10:44.219 --> 01:10:47.416
This is what you've been
searching for your whole life.

01:10:47.736 --> 01:10:50.851
This is why you have the power.

01:10:53.088 --> 01:10:54.906
You can't stop me.

01:10:55.006 --> 01:10:58.442
Use your power
for your own desires,

01:10:58.762 --> 01:11:01.679
to seek your own revenge.

01:11:03.597 --> 01:11:06.912
Use your power.
Call for his heart.

01:11:07.232 --> 01:11:09.509
Call for his life.

01:11:49.462 --> 01:11:51.460
Heart.

01:11:52.738 --> 01:11:54.596
Jake, what is it?

01:11:54.696 --> 01:11:56.693
No!

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:09.618
I don't see Paige anywhere.

01:12:09.718 --> 01:12:11.616
Are you sure this is
the right place, Cole?

01:12:11.716 --> 01:12:13.454
The Source is here. I can sense it.

01:12:13.554 --> 01:12:15.571
Wait, there she is.

01:12:15.671 --> 01:12:17.170
- What is she doing?
- I don't know,

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:18.927
but she's got a black aura
around her.

01:12:19.027 --> 01:12:21.085
- The Source?
- No, it can't be.

01:12:21.185 --> 01:12:23.682
If Phoebe saw my demonic self,
then she'd see his too.

01:12:23.782 --> 01:12:26.079
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
it's not good.

01:12:26.179 --> 01:12:28.276
Come on.

01:12:28.376 --> 01:12:30.314
Jake! Jake, what...?

01:12:30.414 --> 01:12:34.010
Paige? Paige, it's me, Phoebe.
And Piper.

01:12:34.489 --> 01:12:36.587
He's evil. He's hurting his child.

01:12:36.687 --> 01:12:38.265
Someone, hurting...

01:12:38.365 --> 01:12:39.903
No, you're being seduced
into doing this.

01:12:40.003 --> 01:12:42.100
No! No, Jake!

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.779
All right, you know what? Hi.

01:12:43.879 --> 01:12:46.834
Leo, take her, go home.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:12:53.706 --> 01:12:55.565
Let's get out of here.

01:12:55.665 --> 01:12:57.802
Are you sure you're all right?

01:12:57.902 --> 01:13:00.019
Maybe you better lay back down.

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:04.334
I'm not covering for you
anymore, Carol.

01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:08.689
You keep your hands off our son.

01:13:13.403 --> 01:13:15.301
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay behind,

01:13:15.401 --> 01:13:17.798
make sure The Source
doesn't follow you.

01:14:08.219 --> 01:14:10.216
Don't die too quickly, traitor.

01:14:12.254 --> 01:14:15.410
I want your beloved witch
to see your last breath...

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.966
...to feel the heartache of loss again.

01:14:22.882 --> 01:14:27.676
Oracle, find Paige one last time.

01:14:33.828 --> 01:14:35.826
Leo, where's...?

01:14:37.425 --> 01:14:40.500
I'm having a hard time convincing her
that she is not evil.

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.137
- I see that.
- Lamp.

01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:51.068
Bright side? At least she's getting
the hang of her new power.

01:14:51.168 --> 01:14:53.366
That was Mom's crystal.

01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:58.659
- Okay, somebody...
- Off of me!

01:14:58.759 --> 01:15:01.715
Okay, relax. Relax.
All right, now what?

01:15:02.035 --> 01:15:04.412
We just better hope there's
some kind of Wiccan exorcism

01:15:04.512 --> 01:15:06.749
in the Book of Shadows,
because... Yeah.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:14.301
Who are you?

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.457
Piper!

01:15:17.896 --> 01:15:19.894
Piper!

01:15:44.185 --> 01:15:46.562
That's the... That's the...
Look, look, look, look, look.

01:15:46.662 --> 01:15:48.561
I know who that is.

01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:50.558
Your powers are strong.

01:15:50.658 --> 01:15:52.776
But will they be enough
without the power of three?

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:57.130
Shane, what's going on?

01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:59.767
It's okay, honey. I'm here now.

01:16:00.726 --> 01:16:02.064
Stay away from me.

01:16:02.164 --> 01:16:04.662
She still has free will.
You can't force her to choose.

01:16:04.762 --> 01:16:07.139
Oh, but she's already chosen.

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:08.896
Haven't you?

01:16:08.996 --> 01:16:10.854
Come with me.

01:16:10.954 --> 01:16:12.811
You'll be safe forever, I promise.

01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:14.490
Don't listen to him, he's lying.

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:17.246
They only want you for your power.

01:16:17.346 --> 01:16:20.423
You don't have to share it.
It's yours.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.318
You've already seen
what you can do with it.

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:26.595
You did what nobody else could do.

01:16:26.695 --> 01:16:28.972
You nearly saved my son
from his father,

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:31.929
from all the pain and suffering
he's put him through.

01:16:32.968 --> 01:16:36.344
Please help me.
Don't let him hurt me anymore.

01:16:36.444 --> 01:16:38.442
You're my only hope.

01:16:42.677 --> 01:16:44.674
No!

01:16:49.029 --> 01:16:51.026
Help me!

01:16:57.858 --> 01:16:59.597
Phoebe?

01:16:59.697 --> 01:17:02.253
Okay, come on, come on.

01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:09.365
I guess blood's a little thicker
than evil.

01:17:16.436 --> 01:17:20.592
I've broken the Charmed circle before.
I'll do it again.

01:17:20.952 --> 01:17:24.667
Besides, it wasn't a complete loss,

01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:27.344
thanks to Belthazor.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:30.580
- What did you do to him?
- Oh, my God.

01:17:31.059 --> 01:17:33.296
Inspector, would you get out
of here?!

01:17:53.034 --> 01:17:55.551
- Looks like evil wins again, huh?
- Not if I can help it.

01:18:06.218 --> 01:18:09.334
- How'd you do that?
- That's what whitelighters do.

01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:11.651
We heal good people.

01:18:12.131 --> 01:18:14.129
We have to go find Cole.

01:18:25.555 --> 01:18:27.552
Cole?

01:18:30.069 --> 01:18:31.888
Oh, no.

01:18:31.988 --> 01:18:33.326
No, no, no.

01:18:33.426 --> 01:18:36.543
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.995
- Heal him.
- You know that it's against the rules.

01:18:42.095 --> 01:18:44.333
Leo, screw the rules.
The Elders owe us.

01:18:45.252 --> 01:18:47.269
Even if I could, I could only heal
his human half,

01:18:47.369 --> 01:18:50.566
and that wouldn't be enough power
to save him.

01:18:52.883 --> 01:18:54.881
Aren't I half whitelighter?

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.556
I mean, couldn't I use my half
to offset his half?

01:19:01.193 --> 01:19:03.010
It's worth a try.

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:05.109
Take my hand.

01:19:06.547 --> 01:19:08.544
Hold your other hand
over his wound.

01:19:22.368 --> 01:19:24.225
That was good, right?

01:19:24.325 --> 01:19:26.324
That was very good.

01:19:28.361 --> 01:19:31.278
Let's just hope it wasn't all
for nothing.

01:19:32.356 --> 01:19:34.354
Yeah, drive safe.

01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:35.881
Thank you.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.078
Thanks, Anna.

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:44.870
- Feels good to be here again.
- Feels good to be anywhere again.

01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:47.388
I will drink to that.

01:20:49.186 --> 01:20:51.743
- Don't ever scare me like that again.
- Promise.

01:20:54.859 --> 01:20:56.856
You okay?

01:20:57.696 --> 01:20:59.693
I'm not sure.

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.729
Prue?

01:21:04.727 --> 01:21:06.725
Yeah.

01:21:08.484 --> 01:21:11.519
We barely got through the funeral, and
then everything started to go crazy,

01:21:11.839 --> 01:21:14.656
and we haven't had a chance
to mourn yet.

01:21:14.756 --> 01:21:16.753
And that's just not right.

01:21:17.633 --> 01:21:19.790
I think we'll have
the rest of our lives for that.

01:21:23.145 --> 01:21:26.422
I'm still not sure about continuing on
with this destiny thing.

01:21:26.902 --> 01:21:30.577
I need some time to think about it.
I hope you're okay with that.

01:21:31.576 --> 01:21:33.574
Absolutely.

01:21:34.293 --> 01:21:36.290
And I hope you're okay with it too.

01:21:37.129 --> 01:21:39.127
They may not be, but I am.

01:21:42.203 --> 01:21:44.201
So does this mean
I get free drinks now?

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:49.754
I didn't mean it like that.
It's not that I really drink or...

01:21:51.232 --> 01:21:53.091
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

01:21:53.191 --> 01:21:55.987
No. Paige, you belong here.
Remember?

01:21:57.306 --> 01:21:59.983
Are you sure? I don't wanna intrude.

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.217
Come on. Come sit right here.

01:22:07.973 --> 01:22:11.409
Okay, so maybe
Leo and I should go...

01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:14.625
...pretend like we've got something
better to do.

01:22:14.725 --> 01:22:17.123
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

01:22:21.517 --> 01:22:24.793
I won't stay long. I just wanted
to come by and thank you.

01:22:25.113 --> 01:22:26.850
- For what?
- For what? You mean,

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:29.227
aside from saving my life?

01:22:29.547 --> 01:22:31.884
I feel like I should bake you
a cake or something.

01:22:31.984 --> 01:22:33.683
Do you cook?

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:36.739
No. No, not really.

01:22:39.895 --> 01:22:41.513
So how's Shane?

01:22:41.613 --> 01:22:45.209
He's okay, I guess. Except for I'm not
too sure he wants to see me anymore.

01:22:45.529 --> 01:22:48.345
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I can't say I blame him,

01:22:48.445 --> 01:22:50.702
you know. He doesn't know exactly
what happened to him,

01:22:50.802 --> 01:22:52.581
but he knows it's something bad,

01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:55.137
and he knows it's somehow
connected to me.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:58.193
Yeah, well, you're not truly one of us
until you've dated a demon,

01:22:58.513 --> 01:23:00.511
so welcome to the club.

01:23:02.388 --> 01:23:04.387
Can I ask you a question?

01:23:04.905 --> 01:23:06.904
Why did you come
to Prue's funeral?

01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:10.739
I mean, you never even
met her, right?

01:23:12.057 --> 01:23:14.074
No, I never did.

01:23:14.174 --> 01:23:17.091
I don't want this to be taken
the wrong way...

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:21.446
...but I just feel like part of me
lost her too.

01:23:22.645 --> 01:23:24.642
And I just...

01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:28.557
I felt drawn to her, to all you guys.

01:23:29.717 --> 01:23:33.392
I guess it was just part of me
trying to find out who I was.

01:23:40.503 --> 01:23:42.502
Come on. There's something
we need to show you.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.198
Show me what?

01:23:45.298 --> 01:23:47.296
What good magic can do.

01:24:02.118 --> 01:24:05.634
Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

01:24:05.994 --> 01:24:10.109
Come to me, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide

01:24:18.659 --> 01:24:21.256
There's someone here
we thought you should meet.

01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:28.367
Paige.

01:24:33.002 --> 01:24:34.999
Mom?

01:24:48.864 --> 01:24:50.861
Welcome home.
