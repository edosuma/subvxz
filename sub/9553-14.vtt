Angie, everything is

01:34.880 --> 01:35.880
That's right,
everything is set.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.880
You're going to stay at
the Cunningham house.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.380
They're a very nice
middle-class family.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.390
Yeah... hold on for
a minute, will you?

01:42.890 --> 01:45.890
Could you cut blowing in
my ear for just a minute?

01:47.890 --> 01:48.890
Yeah, everything
is fine.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.360
Listen, Angie, you
just make sure

01:50.360 --> 01:51.900
you get on the right
bus this time.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.400
I don't want to pick you
up in Detroit again.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.870
Yes, Angie,
you're talking

01:56.870 --> 01:58.900
to your cousin,
Fonz, that's right.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.900
All right,
I'll see you.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.910
Yeah, right, knock
yourself out.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.210
Oh, I got to get my
cousin, Angie, a job.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.210
Ain't going to be easy.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.710
The man is under-confident,
you know what I mean?

02:11.710 --> 02:13.720
I mean, I once saw him
buying handkerchiefs

02:13.720 --> 02:16.720
with monograms on them with
somebody else's initials.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.720
(chuckling)

02:19.720 --> 02:20.720
That was a joke.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.730
Stick with the ear,
stick with the ear.

02:22.730 --> 02:24.730
Fonzie, I got
to talk to you.

02:24.730 --> 02:25.730
Hey, not now, man,

02:25.730 --> 02:27.600
I got the world
on my shoulders, Al.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.480
This is really important.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.820
It's a personal matter.

02:31.070 --> 02:32.070
All right, sit.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.490
Fonzie, you've got to jump 15
barrels on your motorcycle,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.030
like you did on that
television show.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.530
I'm talking about the
world on my shoulders,

02:41.530 --> 02:42.860
he's talking about
barrel tricks.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.200
There's a new <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Magilla Book
of Records coming out{\r},</font></font></i>

02:45.200 --> 02:47.120
and I got to get my name in it.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.090
How is my jumping
over barrels

02:49.090 --> 02:50.590
going to get you
in this book?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.090
The guy from the <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Book
of Records told m{\r}e</font></font></i>

02:53.090 --> 02:55.430
that he'll give my restaurant
a lot of publicity

02:55.680 --> 02:57.760
if I could get somebody
to break a record here.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.260
Oh, no, man,
I broke my record already.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.130
I'm in retirement-- why
don't you ask these kiddies

03:01.430 --> 03:02.520
to do it?

03:02.520 --> 03:05.850
Nobody cares about the little
businessman anymore.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.190
Nobody cares about
my cousin, Angie.

03:08.190 --> 03:09.560
Angie.

03:09.860 --> 03:10.720
FONZIE:
Hey, Al.

03:10.970 --> 03:12.530
My cousin, Angie, is
coming into town, see?

03:12.530 --> 03:14.940
I want you to give him
a job as a busboy.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.060
He's got it.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.280
You're gonna
do it.

03:18.620 --> 03:19.700
You're gonna jump the barrels.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.070
No barrels, Al.

03:21.370 --> 03:22.450
Let me ask you
a question.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.370
How much money you got
in your publicity chest?

03:24.740 --> 03:26.070
Mmm, about $100.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.290
Yeah, and you need this
record for publicity, right?

03:28.630 --> 03:29.580
You're right.
All right.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.490
I'll be right back.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.010
(music stops playing)

03:45.010 --> 03:47.340
All right...
now listen up.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.680
The man from the
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Magilla Book of Record{\r}s</font></font></i>

03:49.680 --> 03:50.980
is coming here
any day now.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.820
Now, who's going to break
a record for big Al?

03:53.820 --> 03:55.650
(crowd groaning)

03:55.900 --> 03:57.990
You see, what
did I tell you?
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

03:57.990 --> 03:58.990
All right, listen up.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.490
Al says, anybody
breaks a record,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.490
gets in this book here...

04:02.490 --> 04:03.990
gets $100.

04:03.990 --> 04:06.410
(excited murmuring)

04:06.750 --> 04:07.830
Do me a favor, huh?

04:07.830 --> 04:09.280
Organize this
for me.
Yeah, sure, Fonz.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.250
You're really good
at that, thanks a lot.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.250
(all talking)

04:12.750 --> 04:13.750
RICHIE:
No crowding.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.260
He told me to organize,
so I'm gonna organize.

04:16.260 --> 04:19.260
(music resumes playing)

04:21.760 --> 04:24.260
Now I know how to get
the kids interested.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.270
Cold cash.

Hey, Angie,
how's it going?
Oh, hi, Angie.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.060
RICHIE:
Want to play
some basketball later?

04:34.060 --> 04:36.560
No, I'd like to...
I got to work overtime.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.530
I want to pay
for some dishes I broke.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.980
Yeah, well, uh,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.870
those dishes can be pretty
slippery sometimes.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.070
At home, my pop makes me eat
on paper plates.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.900
My pop makes me eat
out on the porch.

04:49.820 --> 04:50.820
What are you doing?

04:50.820 --> 04:52.830
I'm trying to think
of a record to break,

04:52.830 --> 04:54.330
and I need my privacy.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.330
Oh.

04:55.330 --> 04:56.830
Why don't you try
breaking the record

04:56.830 --> 04:59.330
for the most hours with
a menu on your face?

04:59.330 --> 05:00.750
(laughing):
Menu on his face.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.340
Bring us three
root beers, okay?
Yeah.

05:04.340 --> 05:06.340
Coming right up.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.840
Boy, I'm getting better.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.340
You know, uh,
I can't believe

05:11.340 --> 05:13.350
Fonzie's cousin
is so clumsy.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.850
Well, he's not that bad.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.350
He's going back to Kenosha
pretty soon anyway.
Yeah.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.350
(crashing, shattering)

05:20.350 --> 05:22.360
Not fast enough
for Al.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.820
Maybe he can set a record
for breaking the most dishes.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.740
Hey, you know, I think my
hay fever is acting up again.

05:27.740 --> 05:29.080
Whoa.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.370
Maybe you could sneeze your
way into the record books.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.530
Not funny, Rich.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.870
We've got to find
something here.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.260
I mean, there's 100
bucks on the line.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.010
Hey, maybe I could drink
the most water in one drink.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.840
Oh, I don't know, Pots, the
most water in one drink...

05:44.840 --> 05:47.350
yeah, right here-- it's
held by a Tibetan monk.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.770
He drank 835 gallons.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.050
There he is,

05:53.220 --> 05:55.300
standing in the middle
of a dry lake bed.

05:55.810 --> 05:58.780
Yeah? Yeah, and then
five minutes later,

05:58.780 --> 06:01.310
he broke another record.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.370
That's a good one.

06:06.570 --> 06:08.150
I've still got it.
Hey, wait,
I've got it!

06:08.150 --> 06:10.650
I'll break the record for
the most jumping jacks.

06:10.650 --> 06:12.660
Jumping jacks.
One, two, three,

06:12.660 --> 06:15.160
four, five, six,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.160
seven, eight, nine...

06:17.160 --> 06:20.660
Forget it, Pots, you'll never
get off the ground.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.170
I'm trying
to break the record.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.670
I don't know,
what do you think?

06:23.670 --> 06:25.170
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.170
(all talking at once)

06:27.170 --> 06:29.970
I said, "Good
afternoon, gentlemen."

06:30.220 --> 06:31.260
ALL:
Good afternoon, Fonz.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.230
Well, I feel
so much better now.

06:34.230 --> 06:37.230
All right, so now, very calmly,
why don't you teenagers

06:37.730 --> 06:39.650
tell me how you plan
to break this record.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.430
Oh, Fonz, we can't think
of anything!

06:41.680 --> 06:42.600
Calmly.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.900
We can't think
of anything, Fonz,

06:45.240 --> 06:47.820
but, you know, maybe you
can go for another record.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.780
I break records every day.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.200
(chuckling)
He sure does.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.330
But they don't have a category
for that one, Fonz.

06:54.830 --> 06:55.830
Yeah.
Hi, Fonz.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.830
Hey, Angie, how
you doing, huh?

06:57.830 --> 06:59.340
Isn't he cute? How...
how's the job going?

06:59.340 --> 07:00.340
All right.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.840
Got your drinks, guys.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.840
(crashing)

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
One out of three
ain't bad.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.340
That's right.
I'll go get the mop.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.840
Yeah, do that.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.210
Man... Angie's
a clumsy guy.

07:10.510 --> 07:12.880
He's my cousin.
And a heck
of a nice guy.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.800
I like him.
Sweetheart.

07:16.220 --> 07:17.800
Hey, look, I know he's clumsy,

07:17.800 --> 07:19.110
but I'm working with him, huh?

07:19.310 --> 07:20.890
Yeah, and-and he's doing
real well.
Yep.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.280
(dishes crashing, shattering)

07:24.230 --> 07:25.730
It might not have been him.

07:25.730 --> 07:27.230
There are other people
in there.

07:31.230 --> 07:33.740
Fonzie, about
your cousin, Angie...

07:33.740 --> 07:36.240
Yeah, yeah, how many
plates did he break today?

07:36.240 --> 07:38.240
Oh, I don't know,
who counts?
Al...

07:38.240 --> 07:40.740
38 plates, 14 glasses,

07:40.740 --> 07:44.080
and he dropped the cook's derby
in the meat grinder.

07:45.410 --> 07:46.920
You want me to
fire him for you?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
No, don't do it for me,
I love the kid.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.420
Do it for the cook.

07:50.920 --> 07:51.720
Right, right, right.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.510
I'll talk to him, Al.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.510
(crashing)

07:55.510 --> 07:58.010
Can you do it real soon?

07:58.010 --> 08:00.350
Do it nice, but soon.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.150
He dropped the cook's hat
in the meat grinder.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.070
(chuckling)
That's good.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
(snaps fingers)
Cunningham.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.570
He dropped the cook's hat
in the...

08:10.070 --> 08:11.070
in the meat grinder.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.440
(chuckling resumes)

08:12.740 --> 08:14.160
It is funny, huh?

08:14.410 --> 08:16.360
I mean, he's ruining
the Fonzarelli name, you know?

08:16.700 --> 08:17.780
(laughter)

08:17.780 --> 08:18.780
(dishes crashing)

08:18.780 --> 08:19.780
It ain't that funny!

08:19.780 --> 08:22.590
No, it isn't.

Well, I'm glad
you enjoyed it, Angie.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.600
I'm sorry
about the soup, Mr. C.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
Oh, don't give it
a second thought.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.600
These are old
trousers anyway.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.890
Well, I'm going over
to Jenny Piccalo's.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.390
You want to come along, Angie?

08:42.390 --> 08:43.890

Fran and Ollie{\r}.</font></font></i>

08:45.890 --> 08:48.390
Besides, I have to go
to work in a little while.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.900
Your spoon, Mrs. C.

08:49.900 --> 08:50.900
I got it.

08:51.310 --> 08:52.400
Sorry about that.
MARION:
That's all right.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.730
See you folks.
Yes.

08:54.980 --> 08:57.070
Work? But, Mom, he doesn't
even have a job.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.070
Shh, dear,

08:58.070 --> 09:00.040
Arthur hasn't told him
that he's fired yet.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.040
He's afraid Angie will
lose his confidence.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.000
Well, Jenny Piccalo
would give him confidence.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.330
Out, you, and you
be home by 9:00.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.470
Oh, but, Dad, that's when
all the action starts.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.670
Exactly.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.480
I'm going to be an old maid.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.430
Hi, Rich.
Hi.

09:25.350 --> 09:27.430
Have you
eaten yet?

09:27.930 --> 09:29.940
Yeah, uh, we ate
at Arnold's Drive-In.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.940
I put the top down.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:41.110 --> 09:43.620
Can I talk to you alone
for a minute?

09:46.120 --> 09:48.620
Sure.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.090
Do you know there's a girl
on your shoulders?

09:58.380 --> 10:00.800
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.190
Well, yeah, yeah...
we're trying to break

10:03.690 --> 10:05.690
the "carry a girl on
your shoulders" record.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.690
See, it-it's six
and a half hours,

10:07.690 --> 10:09.110
and, uh, we're
practicing.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.030
Oh.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.030
Why can't you be
like a regular kid

10:12.030 --> 10:13.810
and swallow goldfish?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.120
Mr. C, I've got to...

10:20.620 --> 10:22.040
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

10:22.410 --> 10:23.490
In front of your parents?

10:23.490 --> 10:24.820
You couldn't use
my apartment?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.160
I'm hungry.

10:32.670 --> 10:33.130
Duck.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.170
Duck.

10:35.580 --> 10:36.640
Your child is weird.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.060
Mr. C., I got
to talk to you.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.810
Now, you're a business...
Where is Angie?

10:42.010 --> 10:44.560
He's upstairs watching
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Kukla, Fran and Ollie{\r}.</font></font></i>

10:44.930 --> 10:48.010
Don't tell me those things.

10:48.010 --> 10:50.020
Now, look, Mr. C.,
you're a businessman, right?

10:50.020 --> 10:52.940
Now, how do I tell Angie that
he's fired without hurting him?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.740
You don't,
but he'll get over it.

10:55.070 --> 10:57.490
Yeah, I guess so--
he's a Fonzarelli... I think.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.160
Look, Fonzie, I think

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
maybe you're expecting
too much from him.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
You know, what he needs

11:03.160 --> 11:04.500
is something to
build up his ego,

11:04.750 --> 11:07.280
something where he can
gain some self-respect.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.700
He needs a nice, easy job,
one that he can handle.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.000
That's a good idea.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.260
Yeah, you know Mr. C.,
I think you're 100% on the nose.

11:14.260 --> 11:15.620
Give him a shot
in the arm, right?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.380
Yeah, give him
a little push from behind.

11:17.710 --> 11:18.790
Yeah, an easy job
like, uh,

11:18.790 --> 11:21.300
the Cunningham
Hardware Store.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.300
In my hardware store?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.300
I think that's a
wonderful idea.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.800
Who cares, Marion?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.310
Right, who cares?

11:30.310 --> 11:31.310
You're one heck
of a guy.

11:31.810 --> 11:33.310
Let me tell you something,
he is going to love this.

11:33.310 --> 11:34.810
All right... hey!

11:34.810 --> 11:36.310
You stop watching
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Kukla, Fran and Ollie{\r}.</font></font></i>

11:36.310 --> 11:37.280
You're in the hardware business!

11:37.280 --> 11:38.780
He's in the hardware
business now.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.280
You're in the
hardware business!

11:46.710 --> 11:49.290
Yes, Officer, it-it's
a gray panel truck.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.290
It says Cunningham Hardware
Store on the side.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.800
Yeah, Angie lost it.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.300
What difference does
it make who Angie is?

11:56.300 --> 11:59.300
Just find my truck,
will you, please?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.250
Joanie, will you try

12:00.250 --> 12:02.810
and break your record
someplace else?

12:02.810 --> 12:04.310
I didn't lose
your truck.

12:04.810 --> 12:05.810
Oh, Howard,
I don't...

12:05.810 --> 12:08.310
I don't understand
how you could fire Angie.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.260
He seemed like he'd make
such a nice delivery boy.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.770
He's a nice boy, but he lost
my delivery truck, Marion.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.990
Shh, dear,
he's right upstairs.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.770
Do you want
to hurt his feelings?

12:18.990 --> 12:20.570
HOWARD:
His feelings? What about
my delivery truck?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.530
You know what it's like
to try and deliver

12:22.530 --> 12:24.860
a sack of cement
on your back, huh?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.660
Where's your sense
of values, Marion?

12:26.660 --> 12:28.160
Well, where
are you going?

12:28.160 --> 12:30.080
I'm going out
and find that truck.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.000
Duck.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Duck.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.510
All right, relax everybody,
we found your truck.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.840
Elizabeth spotted it.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.850
Oh, I'll see
if I can catch Howard.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.850
Oh, too late.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.850
Well, the fresh air
will do him good.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.350
Hey, Rich,
where was the truck?

12:50.850 --> 12:52.350
Angie accidentally
parked it

12:52.350 --> 12:53.360
in front of
Krepnick's.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.360
An easy mistake.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.310
Every hardware store
looks alike.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.530
Mom, Krepnick's
is a delicatessen.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.620
Right.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.950
Mom, are you going to help me
with my hair or not?

13:05.950 --> 13:07.950
(sighing):
Yes, dear, come on.

13:07.950 --> 13:08.950
Good.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.460
Well, I think
Angie Fonzarelli

13:11.460 --> 13:12.740
is a lemon.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.330
What'd I just hear?

13:14.580 --> 13:17.660
A lemon-- I rinse
her hair with lemon.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.220
Hey, Cunningham,
front and center.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.140
Want to sit down?

13:24.140 --> 13:25.140
Oh, is it okay if I don't?

13:25.640 --> 13:27.640
It's a little hard
getting back up.
Right.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.640
I don't know what to
do with Angie anymore.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.140
I'm running out of time,
I'm running out of ideas.

13:32.650 --> 13:33.150
(fly buzzing)

13:33.650 --> 13:34.650
What are you
waving at?

13:34.650 --> 13:37.150
Oh, there's a fly;
it's bothering me.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.150
I'm talking about family,
you're talking about flies.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.100
The fly landed
on your head, Fonz.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.520
Yeah?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.440
Oh, uh,

13:44.820 --> 13:45.410
it's all right.

13:45.910 --> 13:46.830
I-I'll wait till it leaves.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.490
I'm sure you will.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.700
Oh, l-let me have that magazine,
will you?

13:50.700 --> 13:51.860
Sure, here.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.670
Listen, I-I wouldn't worry
about it, Fonz.

13:54.670 --> 13:56.170
You did the best you could.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.000
You even got Angie a job
at Dad's hardware store.

13:59.260 --> 14:00.340
Are you kidding?
I did better than that.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.790
I fixed him up
with Kitty La Beaux.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.790
He took her to a
drive-in movie, right?

14:04.180 --> 14:05.260
He came home...
in the wrong car.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
He came home in the wrong car.

14:11.470 --> 14:13.470
Cunningham, what
are you doing?

14:13.470 --> 14:15.470
It's got to be the fastest fly
in the world.

14:15.470 --> 14:16.470
I don't believe it.

14:16.470 --> 14:17.970
Oh, he's moving up.
Try and get him.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.480
Hi, Fonz, hi, Rich.
Hey.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.480
I'm going out
for a while.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
(grunts)

14:22.480 --> 14:23.860
(buzzing stops)

14:25.230 --> 14:27.230
He did it.

14:27.230 --> 14:28.230
How did you do that?

14:28.230 --> 14:29.150
Do what?

14:29.450 --> 14:31.870
Get the fly
out of the air, Angie.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.660
That's it,
that's what you can do,

14:33.660 --> 14:35.910
That's how he can get into
the Magilla Book of Records.

14:36.130 --> 14:37.210
Nah, who'd want to do that?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.210
Hey, where are you going?

14:39.210 --> 14:42.670
I'm going to join the Kukla,
Fran and Ollie fan club.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.830
Just don't tell anybody.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.550
See you.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.390
You know, he's got
real fast hands, Fonz.

14:48.390 --> 14:49.390
Yeah, right, so that's
what we got to do--

14:49.890 --> 14:51.390
we got to find something
that he can catch real fast.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.390
Right, right.

14:52.390 --> 14:53.390
Hey, hey, in the book,

14:53.890 --> 14:55.900
I saw a picture of a guy
catching quarters off his elbow.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
Well, that's a start.

14:56.900 --> 14:57.900
You got any
change on you?

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
Oh, no, I don't think so.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
I'm hungry.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.900
Heyyy.
(groans)

15:02.900 --> 15:04.900
I'm going upstairs
to get my piggy bank.

15:04.900 --> 15:05.910
Oh, you got a piggy bank, Fonz?

15:06.410 --> 15:07.410
That's right, I do.

15:07.410 --> 15:08.860
Duck.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.240
Does it go "oink, oink"
when you put pennies in it?

15:11.610 --> 15:13.700
Actually, it doesn't,
but you're going to.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.080
Duck.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.590
Marion, Joanie,
they found my truck.

15:19.590 --> 15:21.590
Where are you?

15:21.590 --> 15:24.420
Nobody cares.

15:24.710 --> 15:27.290
All they care about
is their records.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.590
They want records.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.380
I'll show 'em records.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.380
All right.

15:39.390 --> 15:42.890
(inaudible)

15:46.400 --> 15:48.900
(drumroll)

15:49.230 --> 15:50.320
Okay, kid.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.820
Come on, two minutes and ten
seconds and you got a record.

15:52.820 --> 15:53.790
Let's go.
He looks tired.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.320
I don't think
he's going to make it.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.820
I can't make it!
Oh, look out, look out, Rich.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.320
I can't make it!
Look out, Rich!

15:58.320 --> 15:59.830
(screams)

15:59.830 --> 16:01.830
All right,
the handstander is out

16:02.330 --> 16:03.330
and the piggybacker
is out.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.080
Next.
(groaning)

16:05.300 --> 16:06.880
Hey, he's got it, he's
getting it, he's getting it.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.880
Now, Angie, come on,
you can do it, come on.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.390
All right...

16:10.390 --> 16:11.890
It's, it's all right,
Angie, you can do it.

16:11.890 --> 16:12.810
Just believe.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.640
Next.
Our next
contestant

16:14.920 --> 16:16.840
will be
Ralph Malph.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.140
(cheering)

16:18.140 --> 16:20.650
Ralph, come on.

16:20.650 --> 16:23.650
All right, Ralph's going to try
and break the record

16:23.650 --> 16:25.150
for the world's biggest bubble.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.150
Okay.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.650
Stand back,
this might get sticky.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.570
Oh.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.020
Okay,
Ralph.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.530
(drumroll)

16:34.030 --> 16:35.030
You can do it,
Ralph.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.030
Come on, Ralph.

16:36.030 --> 16:39.030
(all cheering)

16:57.220 --> 17:00.270
No, I'm sorry, kid,
that wasn't even close.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.190
Oh, wait a minute,
that's not fair.

17:02.550 --> 17:03.640
I got another one.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.640
Look at this one-- give me
room-- I got another record.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.640
Give him room,
come on.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.060
What is that?

17:12.450 --> 17:14.319
The world's lowest jump.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.900
(laughter)

17:17.119 --> 17:19.710
Next, next, next!

17:19.710 --> 17:20.710
He didn't even measure it.
Next!

17:20.710 --> 17:22.210
(chuckling):
You still got it, Ralph.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.130
I know.
Yeah.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.080
All right, all right,
just keep it up, Angie,

17:29.080 --> 17:32.050
just keep it up.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.890
See, I can't do it, Fonz.
Hey, wait a minute.

17:35.140 --> 17:36.220
What do you mean
you can't do it?

17:36.220 --> 17:38.220
At least you're keeping up
the coins on the elbow now.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.170
That's half the trick, ain't it?

17:44.760 --> 17:45.850
All right, all right.
Rich.

17:45.850 --> 17:49.350
Next up, we have
Milwaukee's own Potsie Weber.

17:49.350 --> 17:50.850
Now, he's going to attempt

17:50.850 --> 17:53.860
to hold
the world's longest B-flat note

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
while simultaneously jumping
on a pogo stick.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.860
All right, you'll have to beat
two minutes, 31 seconds.

17:58.860 --> 17:59.860
No sweat.

17:59.860 --> 18:02.360
This hay fever
is killing me.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.370
Okay.
All right.

18:03.370 --> 18:04.370
Note, please.

18:04.370 --> 18:05.370
(harmonica plays note,
Potsie sings note)

18:05.370 --> 18:06.370
Got it.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.370
Here we go, guys.

18:08.370 --> 18:09.870
(sings note)

18:09.870 --> 18:10.870
All right, come
on, Potsie.

18:11.370 --> 18:12.260
(all cheering)

18:19.680 --> 18:21.680
(wavering)

18:21.680 --> 18:24.690
(Potsie sneezes, crowd groans)

18:24.690 --> 18:25.690
Oh, no.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.690
He sneezed, he sneezed.

18:26.690 --> 18:27.690
Gesundheit.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.190
No record.

18:29.690 --> 18:31.190
How about a B-flat
with a sneeze?

18:31.190 --> 18:32.690
Please, please,
next, next.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.480
(all groaning)

18:34.650 --> 18:38.230
All right, where's the kid
with the nine-pound lima bean?

18:39.540 --> 18:41.120
That kid lied.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.910
He painted a potato green.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.240
That's it.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.740
I've got to get out of here;
it's driving me crazy.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.240
Oh, oh, no, wait, wait.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.740
We've got the owner of Arnold's,
Al Delvecchio.

18:48.740 --> 18:49.750
Show him, Al, let's go.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.250
Wait a minute, hold it.
All right.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.750
Hold it, just a minute!
All right, say go.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.250
Just stop!
Say go, I'm ready.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.080
Just a minute.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.560
That's magnificent,

19:04.560 --> 19:06.850
but I'm afraid Mr. Durante
still holds the record.

19:07.060 --> 19:08.150
I'm flipping pancakes.

19:08.150 --> 19:09.600
What's that got to do
with my nose?

19:09.600 --> 19:11.650
All right.
One...

19:11.650 --> 19:14.150
ALL:
Two... three...

19:14.150 --> 19:17.110
four... five...

19:17.490 --> 19:18.570
It's useless, Fonz,
I can't do it.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.530
Hey, don't you ever say
"It's useless" to me again.

19:20.530 --> 19:21.530
You understand?
Now, listen.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.500
Success is one
thing-- that's cool.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.000
I like success,
too, right?
Right.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It's not the
most important.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.500
The thing is you give
it the best shot.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
You give it
your best shot.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.840
That's all you
can do, right?

19:30.090 --> 19:31.670
Right.
Get them up there,
get them up there.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.170
All right,
all right.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.180
Got one.
You got one, you
got one, all right!

19:36.180 --> 19:38.180
See that?

19:42.180 --> 19:43.680
I'm being calm,
I'm being calm.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.190
ALL:
67... 68...

19:48.190 --> 19:49.190
69...

19:49.190 --> 19:50.190
All right.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.690
ALL:
70...

19:51.690 --> 19:52.690
Way to go, Al baby.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.190
Thanks, Ralph.

19:54.190 --> 19:56.700
(all groaning)

19:57.200 --> 19:58.610
You were closer
with your nose.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.230
I certainly hope
that's everything.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.400
Oh, come on, Richie,
do something.

20:04.740 --> 20:07.740
All we have left is...
Fonzie's cousin.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.660
All right, I'm going
to go get Angie.

20:09.660 --> 20:10.660
Angie?

20:10.660 --> 20:12.160
Angie, come on out.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.160
We're ready for you.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.160
All right, he's going
to be right out.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.670
I think he's got it.

20:16.670 --> 20:19.670
(coins clattering)

20:19.670 --> 20:20.670
He's a little nervous.

20:21.090 --> 20:22.970
I have got to get
out of this hick town.

20:23.170 --> 20:24.260
Hey, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.260
Hey, Angie, get out here.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.760
All right, you see this?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.260
This is the next Fonzarelli

20:29.260 --> 20:31.180
that's going to be in
your book, Mr. Whoever.

20:31.510 --> 20:32.930
All right, okay,
now, Angie,

20:33.230 --> 20:34.320
do whatever you do with
these 12 coins, right,

20:34.320 --> 20:36.070
you're going for the record,
you're going for the record.

20:36.270 --> 20:38.190
All right, just a s...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.440
(cheering)

20:43.910 --> 20:45.360
Hold it.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.750
Hold it, hold it,
please, please, hold it.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.700
That is not the record,
12 is not the record.

20:49.700 --> 20:53.250
A man in Topeka, Kansas, did
39 coins about two months ago.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.120
That is the new record.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.500
Well, I'll tell
you something.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.960
We're going for 40.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.880
I can't do it, Fonz, too many.

21:01.210 --> 21:02.790
Why are you saying you
can't do it, Angie, huh?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.800
Listen, I had to walk before
I could run, too, right?

21:05.800 --> 21:08.800
I had to work up to the
Aloha Pussycats, right?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
First I had to meet
the Polaski twins,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
I had to go with
the Hooper triplets.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.310
It's still too many, Fonz.
It's not too many.

21:14.310 --> 21:15.810
You got to believe,
all right?

21:15.810 --> 21:17.310
You got to give it your
best shot, that's all.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.310
We're going
to work it up.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.810
First you're going to
do 20 coins, right?

21:19.810 --> 21:21.310
Ralphie, Ralphie, you're
gonna get me some more coins.

21:21.310 --> 21:22.310
Come on.
You got it.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.650
Come on.
All right, right?

21:25.650 --> 21:28.040
All right, take, take it easy.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.400
All right, 20 coins.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.410
You can do it, Angie.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.910
Just take it easy.
He'll do it.

21:31.910 --> 21:32.820
(drumroll)

21:40.500 --> 21:42.000
(cheering)

21:46.510 --> 21:47.590
30 coins.

21:47.590 --> 21:49.590
Just, just concentrate
and catch those babies.

21:49.590 --> 21:50.980
(drumroll)

21:56.570 --> 21:58.850
(cheering)

22:03.110 --> 22:05.160
(drumroll)

22:08.360 --> 22:10.160
This is for the
record, Angie.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.660
40 coins.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.030
(scoffing):
Can't be done.

22:20.790 --> 22:23.210
All right, now, Angie,
all you got to do is believe,

22:23.210 --> 22:24.510
right, give it your best shot.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.940
(cheering)

22:48.730 --> 22:51.820
Heyyy.

22:51.820 --> 22:54.790
"The new record
for coin snatching--

22:54.790 --> 22:58.330
"40 coins-- was set
by Angie Fonzarelli

22:58.330 --> 23:01.080
"in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
at Arnold's Drive-In--

23:01.080 --> 23:02.710
Al Delvecchio, owner."
Now...

23:02.710 --> 23:03.550
That's so nice.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.550
Okay, listen to this.

23:06.050 --> 23:09.500
The record for the longest
watermelon seed spitting is...

23:09.500 --> 23:11.920
Joanie, that's enough.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.230
Go do your homework.

23:13.230 --> 23:14.010

23:14.510 --> 23:16.510
Oh, really?
Isn't that amazing?
