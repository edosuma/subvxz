So according to a friend of a friend
of mine who lives in the county,

09:40.355 --> 09:44.796
Wayville Hill Sanitarium became infamous
for its atrocious experiments

09:44.896 --> 09:51.200
conducted on the patients,
between around 1925 to 1928.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.903
The most popular case
is the one of a Mary Weaver.

09:55.003 --> 09:59.841
It's even said that Mary's ghost still roams
these corridors searching for something.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.224

10:14.324 --> 10:19.128
Mary was in room 502...

10:19.728 --> 10:25.403
which should be
at the end of this corridor.

We are in room 502
of Wayville Hill Sanitarium.

11:37.172 --> 11:42.183
Can you explain to the people watching this
why I so very badly wanted to come here?

11:42.543 --> 11:45.547
Because of the story of Mary Weaver.

11:45.647 --> 11:48.052
CHAD: And what is that?

11:48.883 --> 11:52.554
Back in 1927,
the body of nurse Mary Weaver

11:52.654 --> 11:55.590
was found dead in this room,

11:55.690 --> 11:57.926
laying in a pool of her own blood.

11:58.026 --> 12:02.397
It's said that she committed suicide
after a psychotic breakdown,

12:02.497 --> 12:06.234
following the murder of her baby.

12:06.334 --> 12:11.506
After she became pregnant, she was
admitted to this hospital for anxiety.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.643
The doctor in charge believed
her unborn baby was the devil.

12:14.743 --> 12:17.779
So immediately upon giving birth,

12:17.879 --> 12:21.886
he slit the baby's throat
as she watched helplessly.

12:24.185 --> 12:28.058
He didn't even bother
to cut the umbilical cord first.

12:29.023 --> 12:31.493
She completely lost it,

12:31.593 --> 12:35.933
and was locked in this room,
to rot and die.

12:37.131 --> 12:42.471
It's said that she just rocked back and forth,
begging for them to give her baby back.

12:42.571 --> 12:46.007
One night, she managed
to break the window,

12:46.107 --> 12:51.986
and using a shard of glass,
she disemboweled herself completely.

12:53.114 --> 12:54.885
CHAD: Cut.

12:55.184 --> 12:57.452
Damn, you're good.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.121
That was good.

13:00.221 --> 13:02.624
