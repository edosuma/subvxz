00:01.235 --> 00:02.836
BY LEE:
<i>Previously, on</i> Dance Moms...
Yeah!

00:02.836 --> 00:06.006
ABBY LEE: Maddie who?
JESSALYN:
<i>She's gonna be on the team,</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:08.408
<i>and there's nothing that</i>
<i>these moms can do about it.</i>

00:08.408 --> 00:09.710
Brynn makes it official. Yes!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.144
Congratulations.

00:11.144 --> 00:13.247
<i>I read that Maddie</i>
<i>is leaving the team.</i>

00:13.247 --> 00:15.682
I'll let you guys know my plans.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.017
The moms are not getting along.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.919
I'm gonna punch her
in the (bleep) face.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.321
So watch your (bleep)
that way.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.823
I am sick of her!
Oh...!

00:22.823 --> 00:25.459
ASHLEE: You don't want to be
here, just go home. Go.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.761
If you want to stay here and
let her play her (bleep) games,

00:27.761 --> 00:29.663
then you can‐‐
so (bleep) you all!

00:29.663 --> 00:31.732
(crying):
I'm done. You're all (bleep).

00:31.732 --> 00:33.200
You just got the jacket.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.668
(Brynn sobbing)

00:34.668 --> 00:36.370
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:36.370 --> 00:37.704
Where are your friends?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.339
I don't have
any friends here, JoJo.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.440
(laughter)

00:40.440 --> 00:41.675
Everything out
of your mouth

00:41.675 --> 00:43.310
is mean and hurtful.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.345
ASHLEE: <i>You're just jealous</i>
<i>that Brynn has had</i>

00:45.345 --> 00:46.513
<i>a better season than Kendall.</i>

00:46.513 --> 00:48.148
Abby, I am not
allowing this woman

00:48.148 --> 00:51.552
to talk to my child like that!
Why are you so mean?!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.053
I'm done. I'm leaving. Good‐bye.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.188
Jill! Jill!

00:55.188 --> 00:57.891
ABBY LEE: <i>You are a force</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.693
You can't lose.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.029
So, maybe Abby's trying
to guilt you into staying.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.798
I mean, if we don't come back,
it's gonna be really sad.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.236
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:09.236 --> 01:10.771
♪ ♪

01:19.513 --> 01:21.582
Like, my outfit underneath this
isn't really on point.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.119
(indistinct chatter)
ABBY LEE: Dee?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.223
KIRA:
Abby, are you gonna

01:30.223 --> 01:31.625
come do pyramid?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.260
Uh, no. I spent

01:33.260 --> 01:36.163
two hours last night
looking for a piece of fabric!

01:36.163 --> 01:38.165
After I told them
to pull it out.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.533
ABBY LEE:
<i>The moms are always</i>

01:39.533 --> 01:41.702
<i>looking for me at the studio.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:43.704
I don't think they have any idea

01:43.704 --> 01:46.073
the kind of stress that
I'm under running a business.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.709
<i>Just give me my space,</i>
<i>let me do what I need to do,</i>

01:48.709 --> 01:51.845
<i>and when I'm ready,</i>
<i>I'll be out there.</i>

01:51.845 --> 01:53.213
<i>If they respected me</i>

01:53.213 --> 01:56.550
as a businesswoman,
they would stay out of my hair.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.018
Well, I was just
hoping that we

01:58.018 --> 01:59.620
<i>would</i> get to do pyramid,
because the moms

01:59.620 --> 02:00.721
obviously were not thrilled

02:00.721 --> 02:02.856
that Brynn was put on
the team, and I know

02:02.856 --> 02:05.025
this would be
a good pyramid for her.

02:05.025 --> 02:09.129
So I'm hoping that...
I'm hoping that...

02:09.129 --> 02:11.064
<i>I know that Abby</i>
All right, thanks, Abby.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.332
is busy,

02:12.332 --> 02:13.867
<i>but I am anxious</i>
<i>to get to pyramid.</i>

02:13.867 --> 02:16.937
We have a lot to discuss about
the moms' behavior last week.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.439
And your highest scoring
duet‐trio,

02:19.439 --> 02:21.775
"The World Is Ours"!

02:25.512 --> 02:27.914
Here's your jacket.
Makes it official.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.416
Congratulations.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.651
Jill, Melissa,

02:30.651 --> 02:33.153
you were saying something
about the scores.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.354
That means nothing to me.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.822
We asked you
for the score sheets.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.325
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to you try

02:38.325 --> 02:39.593
to discredit
what happened.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.927
Let her have something!

02:40.927 --> 02:44.064
Do you want some
stupid (bleep) on your team?

02:44.064 --> 02:45.165
ASHLEE:
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

02:45.165 --> 02:46.533
Let's go. Come on.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.135
(Brynn sobbing)

02:48.135 --> 02:49.870
It really should have been
a happy,

02:49.870 --> 02:51.038
victorious moment for Brynn,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.840
<i>but the moms ruined it,</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:55.008
let them get away with it.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.112
ASHLEE: I don't have
any friends here, JoJo.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.580
(laughter)

03:00.580 --> 03:03.183
MELISSA: <i>What are you guys</i>
<i>looking forward to this week?</i>

03:03.183 --> 03:06.987
Uh, a week without...

03:06.987 --> 03:09.356
Drama? With
the mothers?

03:10.824 --> 03:11.992
(laughs)

03:11.992 --> 03:13.660
Well, you just
stay away

03:13.660 --> 03:15.495
from, you know, the one.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.564
I mean, I love Brynn...
Well, yeah.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.133
but the only thing is,
when she got her team jacket,

03:20.133 --> 03:21.802
her mom started,

03:21.802 --> 03:24.237
like, crying,
and then they both walked away.

03:24.237 --> 03:25.505
It‐it made no sense.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.874
I just got mad that the moms
said it was rigged.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.109
Kenz, we're not
saying that word,

03:29.109 --> 03:30.110
and we're not
talking about that.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.978
That's over.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.915
Okay, but that's not what
we're talking about.
Just shush.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.083
No one said that.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.085
Ashlee has proven that
she's not a team player.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.519
You know, her daughter finally

03:39.519 --> 03:41.054
<i>is an official member</i>
<i>of the team,</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.823
<i>and she storms off.</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:45.192
The moms can argue,
but we always come together.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.294
But it's not the case
with Ashlee.

03:47.294 --> 03:50.630
This team is really
too stressful. (laughs)

03:50.630 --> 03:52.666
Aren't you happy that
you get to do other things

03:52.666 --> 03:54.801
besides being on the team?
I mean that, you know,

03:54.801 --> 03:56.536
you get to do
other opportunities.
Of course.

03:56.536 --> 03:57.971
Like, not to be rude,

03:57.971 --> 04:00.540
but am I gonna choose a movie
or a competition?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.509
Obviously
I'm gonna choose a movie.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.077
Right.
But my team is always

04:04.077 --> 04:06.346
what I'm gonna go back
to‐‐ I mean, they're
my best friends,

04:06.346 --> 04:07.981
and I love dancing with them.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.417
MELISSA:
<i>Maddie being on the team</i>

04:10.417 --> 04:12.819
<i>has been wonderful, of course,</i>
<i>but she has had</i>

04:12.819 --> 04:15.689
<i>to turn down jobs,</i>
<i>because, you know,</i>

04:15.689 --> 04:18.258
<i>the team always comes first.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna say</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:21.161
she's <i>always</i> gonna be a member,
but that's gossip right now.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.796
<i>This team is</i>
<i>not gonna always be</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:23.897
this team.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.098
People grow up.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.534
I'm always going to be
an ALDC dancer.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.803
Right.
It's not like after I'm...

04:29.803 --> 04:31.772
done dancing there,
because I'm older,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.440
or I get another job,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.709
it's not like I just, like,
forget about it.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.344
Like, I will never
forget about it.
No.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.945
It is probably
the craziest studio ever.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.385
(groans)

04:45.385 --> 04:47.087
ASHLEE:
So...

04:47.087 --> 04:51.091
does anybody even really care
that Brynn is <i>now</i> on the team?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.260
No. Do you guys care?
I don't really care.
That's what I thought.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.161
Nobody cares.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.796
HOLLY:
It is what it is.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.430
I'm just glad that I'm
not gonna have to hear

04:57.430 --> 05:00.000
the comment of, "Well,
you're not even part
of this team anymore."

05:00.000 --> 05:01.468
Because I'm sick
of hearing that.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.739
JILL:
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Ashlee fits in with us.</i>

05:05.739 --> 05:09.209
<i>You know, she has</i>
<i>to bring other kids down</i>

05:09.209 --> 05:11.011
to make her kid look good.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.145
ASHLEE:
I do think Kendall

05:12.145 --> 05:13.180
could have played it up

05:13.180 --> 05:14.514
a little bit more.
I'm sure you do.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.949
Who are you to
judge Kendall?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.184
It's a duo.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.718
<i>We don't need anybody like that</i>

05:18.718 --> 05:20.387
on our team.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.523
Welcome back.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.958
We were at...

05:24.958 --> 05:26.426
Expressions Dance Competition,

05:26.426 --> 05:28.328
and...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.163
you guys did really well.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.431
We did something

05:31.431 --> 05:32.766
that was completely unexpected,

05:32.766 --> 05:36.136
<i>by the crowd</i>
and <i>by the competition, and...</i>

05:36.136 --> 05:38.104
<i>we were the overall</i>
<i>high‐scoring winning group.</i>

05:38.104 --> 05:39.906
(whooping)

05:44.211 --> 05:45.946
ABBY LEE:
All right,

05:45.946 --> 05:48.215
let's talk about our trios.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.518
So, Brynn, congratulations.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.019
She led her team
to victory.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.356
You were the highest scoring
duet‐trio of the event.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.724
<i>I thought you were outstanding.</i>

05:57.724 --> 05:59.559
<i>From where I was sitting,</i>
<i>I loved the number.</i>

05:59.559 --> 06:01.561
Now...

06:01.561 --> 06:03.096
you are a member of this team.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.998
(applause)

06:07.300 --> 06:09.636
ASHLEE:
Abby, how do you
really feel about moms

06:09.636 --> 06:13.006
who don't necessarily agree
with the way the results went,

06:13.006 --> 06:15.642
automatically questioning...
MELISSA: Why don't you
just stop‐‐ all you want

06:15.642 --> 06:18.278
is drama here‐‐ why don't we
just go on with the pyramid.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.847
Okay, I know what you think.
I wasn't talking to you.
I was asking Abby.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.716
HOLLY:
Why are we bringing this up?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.585
ASHLEE:
We're talking about the trio.
I don't care!

06:25.585 --> 06:27.721
You guys never once
put and take into account

06:27.721 --> 06:30.223
that this kid
has feelings, too, <i>ever.</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:31.658
JILL: Because everything
out of your mouth

06:31.658 --> 06:33.193
is mean and hurtful.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.928
ASHLEE: You're just
jealous that Brynn

06:34.928 --> 06:36.463
has had a better season
than Kendall.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.370
ASHLEE:
It's all over social media.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.906
It doesn't...
Kendall, don't
listen to her.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.941
It's not all over
social media.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.376
Trust me.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.278
She's a fool.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.480
JILL: That's a lie.
That's a flat‐out lie.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.083
HOLLY:
You know what? Why don't we
just focus on the pyramid,

06:57.083 --> 06:59.085
get moved on to this,
because this

06:59.085 --> 07:00.987
is not conducive to the girls.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.924
JILL: This is what
it's come down to.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.993
Every frickin' day,
thanks to that one.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.296
You're not
allowed to speak

07:09.296 --> 07:10.664
or look at my child.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.265
I wasn't talking
to either of you.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.633
I was talking
to Abby.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.668
Then don't speak
when she's around.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.636
ASHLEE: You know,
it just amazes me

07:16.636 --> 07:18.872
that she won, you said
it was not even the real scores.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.507
MELISSA:
I'm not dealing with this.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.609
ASHLEE:
I care about her feelings.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.345
But...
JILL: So much that she has to
tear down every kid to make hers

07:25.345 --> 07:26.713
feel good.
ASHLEE:
I have not torn down kids, Jill.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.082
JILL:
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
You're the one

07:29.082 --> 07:32.285
who tears down kids every day.
You guys say crap
ABBY LEE: All right!

07:32.285 --> 07:33.620
about my kid all the time.

07:35.021 --> 07:38.458
Uh, you're not out there,
Kendall, so you don't know.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.894
Excuse me. Abby, I am
not allowing this woman

07:40.894 --> 07:44.497
to talk to my child like that!

07:45.832 --> 07:49.269
HOLLY:
<i>Wow. Kendall yelled at Ashlee.</i>

07:49.269 --> 07:51.905
Our kids are becoming
like their mothers,

07:51.905 --> 07:55.141
and is that a really good thing?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.843
Grow the (bleep) up!

07:56.843 --> 07:59.245
I'm done. I'm leaving. Good‐bye.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.581
Jill! Jill!
No!

08:01.581 --> 08:03.450
You can have her!
Have her!
I tell all of you to go,

08:03.450 --> 08:05.418
you don't go.
Have fun.
I'm leaving.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.722
I am so over this!

08:08.722 --> 08:10.890
This is absolutely... nuts.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.326
<i>I understand now</i>
<i>how Kendall gets...</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:16.296
so upset,
because I'm seeing Jill do it.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.965
I just don't think that's great
for their blood pressure.

08:18.965 --> 08:22.235
MELISSA: Don't leave.
Not for her. Jill...

for years.

push you out.

17:09.262 --> 17:13.165

a bad rap for a long time.

crap about you, so...

17:40.059 --> 17:43.095

yesterday, right?

Hopefully.

you and I can do

sometimes the way that
I would react to it.

think Abby meant

26:08.734 --> 26:10.969
about that Mackenzie
residency stuff?

26:10.969 --> 26:12.771
MELISSA:
I think she's just saying it
to make it a point

26:12.771 --> 26:13.939
to Mackenzie to...

26:13.939 --> 26:15.240
about the J. Lo.
Well, see,

26:15.240 --> 26:16.975
I hear something different.
I hear her saying

26:16.975 --> 26:18.844
Mackenzie's never
leaving ever.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.913
MELISSA:
Yeah, never know.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.082
Mackenzie has lots of stuff
going on right now.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.185
Right. So maybe Abby's trying
to guilt you into staying.
Well, I'm not

26:26.185 --> 26:28.520
gonna miss out on my
kid's stuff anymore.
HOLLY: You don't want

26:28.520 --> 26:31.657
to ever hold a child back,
if there's more for them.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.292
And I think,
for Abby, she has

26:33.292 --> 26:35.761
to recognize that there
is a bigger world

26:35.761 --> 26:37.262
for Maddie.
I mean, if we don't

26:37.262 --> 26:39.231

Are you just saying
that in case,

26:43.969 --> 26:45.571

26:45.571 --> 26:47.439
that's a big
possibility?
I don't know yet.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.862
<i>they're trained.</i>

37:43.862 --> 37:45.897
<i>They get out there and they</i>

37:45.897 --> 37:46.965
make it look easy.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.566

<i>This is Brynn's first solo</i>

38:02.380 --> 38:04.716
<i>as an official team member,</i>
<i>and I know</i>

38:04.716 --> 38:06.785
<i>the moms don't want Brynn</i>
<i>on the team.</i>

38:06.785 --> 38:07.886
<i>But as long as</i>
<i>Brynn keeps winning,</i>

38:07.886 --> 38:09.287
<i>we're going to be on the team.</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:11.656
And there is nothing
the moms can do to change that.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.925
<i>So she better win.</i>

38:13.925 --> 38:15.093
Third place...

ASHLEE:
<i>Brynn's trio</i>

38:49.260 --> 38:50.995
beat Maddie's trio last week,

38:50.995 --> 38:53.631
and this week,
she just beat Mackenzie.

38:53.631 --> 38:56.534
<i>I think that she's definitely</i>
<i>giving the Ziegler girls</i>

38:56.534 --> 38:57.602
a run for their money.

38:57.602 --> 38:58.736
Next, we have teen solo.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.707

39:10.281 --> 39:13.218
Kalani may not have
won her category, but

39:13.218 --> 39:17.021
<i>she is learning</i>
<i>how to win the job.</i>

39:17.021 --> 39:19.023
Ultimately, that might
just be more important.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.525
You never know who's
going to be in the audience.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.261
<i>She might get a call</i>
<i>from J. Lo tomorrow,</i>

39:23.261 --> 39:25.663
saying, "Hey, I need
a new backup dancer."

39:25.663 --> 39:27.665
And then Kalani will be gone.

39:27.665 --> 39:29.300
Next, we have teen group.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.336
HOLLY: <i>The moms may not be</i>
<i>on the same page,</i>

39:31.336 --> 39:33.371
but the girls have to show
everyone in Vegas

39:33.371 --> 39:35.473
that they are a winning team.

"Hanging On."

"Bowie Still Dancing."

HOLLY:
<i>Amazing. "Bowie Still Dancing"</i>

39:56.394 --> 39:58.496
gets first place
in the teen division.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.165
<i>The girls looked</i>
<i>magnificent on stage</i>

40:01.165 --> 40:04.402

40:25.456 --> 40:27.258
We're in Vegas, let's celebrate.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.927
ABBY LEE:
Girls, it was a good day,
everybody.

40:28.927 --> 40:29.928
Congrats. We won the group.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.496
Gianna, everything looked great.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.964
I thought it was outstanding.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.165
The hair and the makeup,
it all worked.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.467
Thank you to everybody
who worked hard.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.036
All right, I'm gonna go,

40:38.036 --> 40:40.138
because I had all these plans

40:40.138 --> 40:42.540
and now I'm disgusting.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.309
HOLLY:
<i>Even though the ALDC won,</i>

40:44.309 --> 40:46.678
<i>our team is still not a team.</i>

40:46.678 --> 40:49.147
ASHLEE:
I'm just glad that Brynn's
solo ended up being

40:49.147 --> 40:51.215
a solid performance,

40:51.215 --> 40:53.251
but I'm sad that she said
she was really nervous.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.788
ABBY LEE:
Today you were nervous?

40:58.389 --> 41:00.191
ASHLEE:
I just think that

41:00.191 --> 41:01.459
the excitement or stress...

41:01.459 --> 41:02.460
Maddie's nervous every week.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.528
ASHLEE:
... from the week was...

41:03.528 --> 41:04.862
I think that
contributed

41:04.862 --> 41:06.197
to it a little bit.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.732
What do you mean
by "the excitement"?

41:07.732 --> 41:09.934
Fighting and the stress
that the week started off with

41:09.934 --> 41:11.235
was hard on everybody.

41:11.235 --> 41:12.603
But really,
you brought...

41:12.603 --> 41:13.938
you brought all
that on yourself,

41:13.938 --> 41:15.239
because you're the one
that went there with...

41:15.239 --> 41:17.275
Not intentionally.
Well, you did it, though.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.609
Jill, do you want
to bring that up anymore?

41:18.609 --> 41:19.911
JILL: I don't want
to bring it up.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.246
I'm sorry for that
whole situation, too.

41:22.246 --> 41:23.281
No one wants that.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.950
I think we all have
to take accountability

41:25.950 --> 41:27.885
for what we do and what we say

41:27.885 --> 41:29.887
all the time,
you know?

41:29.887 --> 41:31.656
And it can't always be
someone else's fault.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.225
Well, I think part
of the issue is,

41:34.225 --> 41:35.393
is that we keep saying
we want to move forward

41:35.393 --> 41:37.061
but we have a tendency

41:37.061 --> 41:38.930
of going backwards.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.632
I just don't know,
where do we go from here?

41:41.632 --> 41:43.334
There's not gonna be
a quick fix to this.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.444
Welcome, Christy.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.446
Thank you for having us.

41:55.446 --> 41:56.614
If you're fighting for a spot,

41:56.614 --> 41:57.548
<i>Brynn's is not the one</i>

41:57.548 --> 41:58.583
<i>you're gonna get.</i>

41:58.583 --> 42:00.385
You know that
we want to be here.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.453
Kendall, you're doing
a duet with Maddie.

42:02.453 --> 42:03.721
(shrieking)

42:03.721 --> 42:04.889
Maddie's not gonna
be here tomorrow.

42:04.889 --> 42:06.858
This is a solo, now, for JoJo?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.726
You want to take it away
from Kendall, then?

42:08.726 --> 42:11.863
It never works out for Kendall,
and you make sure of it.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.897
MELISSA:
<i>Why do we have to do this?</i>

42:12.897 --> 42:14.766
Just say the girls
all did great.

42:14.766 --> 42:15.967
You're leaving anyway,
so don't worry about it.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.436
Melissa, anything to say?

42:18.436 --> 42:19.504
MELISSA:
<i>I'm tired of it.</i>

42:19.504 --> 42:20.438
There's more to the world

42:20.438 --> 42:21.472
than going to
a dance competition.
