00:03.969 --> 00:06.673
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.576

00:09.609 --> 00:12.512

00:12.545 --> 00:16.116

01:18.712 --> 01:20.847
Each year, for our
end-of-the-season luau,

01:20.880 --> 01:23.249
everybody makes
sand sculptures.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.151
I love sand sculptures.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.887
I hate them,
but the members love them.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.890
So this year, I want you
to make sure
they're not too boring.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.492
We could do a theme.

01:32.525 --> 01:35.495
Yeah, let's sculpt bodacious
bikini babes, huh?

01:35.528 --> 01:36.763
( all chuckling )

01:36.796 --> 01:38.631
Okay, we can shove
an apple in your mouth

01:38.665 --> 01:41.401
and have a roast pig
at the luau.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.636
Now, after the sand thingies
we all go to the luau

01:43.670 --> 01:46.740
and all the members come
with all their
hungry families.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.509
- And all their
big fat tips for us.
- Zack: That's right.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.545
No hawking the members
for end-of-the-year tips.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.848
- I pay you enough.
- Yeah, right.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.617
As per the employee handbook,
if any member

01:57.650 --> 02:01.488
is foolish enough to tip you,
the club is entitled to 10%.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.556
What? Oh, come on,
you can't do that.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.359
It's immoral. It's illegal.
It's... it's...

02:06.393 --> 02:09.829
- It's mean and nasty.
- I can do anything I want.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.632
I'm the boss.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.468
Come on, Daddy.
Where's that generous,

02:15.502 --> 02:18.171
caring, big papa bear I love?

02:18.204 --> 02:21.307
Okay, you can keep the 10%.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.244
Consider it a bonus.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.513
- Oh, yeah.
- Great.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.882
- Thanks, Papa bear.
- ( chuckles )

02:28.915 --> 02:30.917
Not in front of the help.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.587
Morris, you are
in big trouble, bucko!

02:34.621 --> 02:37.323
Hi, Ms. Carosi,
is something wrong?

02:37.357 --> 02:39.893
I know it was you
who sold Mrs. King

02:39.926 --> 02:42.696
the mayonnaise
suntan lotion!

02:42.729 --> 02:45.699
Yes, well, I heard
it was good for the skin.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.501
Wrong! As we speak,

02:48.535 --> 02:52.706
that poor woman
is being attacked
by a flock of hungry seagulls.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.608
Well, at least
she'll have a good tan.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.845
That's it. If you think
my father has a temper,

02:58.878 --> 03:00.814
you ain't seen
nothing yet.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.949
Of all the irresponsible,

03:03.049 --> 03:06.519
disrespectful,
unprofessional...

03:09.456 --> 03:11.491
irresistible...

03:13.727 --> 03:16.363
- adorable...
- Lovable.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.064
...kissable.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.603
- I love taking
breaks with you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.405
Mayonnaise suntan lotion?

03:25.438 --> 03:27.674
I don't know.
It sounded like
one of your scams.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.676
It is frightening
how well you know me.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.278
- I've had lots
of time to study.
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.913
It has been a great summer.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.484
I just can't believe you're
gonna leave in two days.

03:37.517 --> 03:40.086
- Zack, I...
- Shh.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.689
Let's not waste time talking.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.429
Morris, get your lips
off my daughter!

03:49.462 --> 03:52.399
- Daddy!
- Stacy, I'm surprised at you.

03:52.432 --> 03:55.502
I thought you had taste.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.405
Daddy, Zack's a great guy
if you'd just get to know him.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.807
I know enough. I never
want to see you
with him again.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.443
Break's over.
Get back to work!

04:03.476 --> 04:04.811
Get!

04:05.779 --> 04:07.313
Get!

04:17.357 --> 04:19.826
- Slow day, huh?
- Yeah, I know.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.861
Nobody's drowning.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.531
Well, I hope the next guy
I save is real cute.

04:24.564 --> 04:27.367
If I see one,
I'll toss him in.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.569
Yoo-hoo, AC?

04:29.602 --> 04:32.072
Oh no, not again.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.808
- Just think tip.
- Right.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.978
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.614
Oh, please, tell me
you're leaving your husband

04:41.648 --> 04:44.317
- so you can run away with me.
- ( giggling )

04:45.985 --> 04:48.855
Oh, no. Mr. Robinson
and I are leaving early.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.124
- Oh.
- But before I go,

04:51.157 --> 04:53.660
could you do that thing
for me again?

04:53.693 --> 04:56.896
Oh, anything for you,
Mrs. Robinson.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.901
Oh, oh!

05:01.935 --> 05:05.038
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, AC. Oh.

05:05.071 --> 05:09.309
Here's your tip.
Have
a wonderful year, sweetie.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.778
Thank you.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.051
Whoa! 50 bucks.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.054
Well, that's nothing.
I got 75 from her husband.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.625
Hey, watch it!

05:26.893 --> 05:30.430
Hey, there's a note
on it for you.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.433
''Dear Slater, I've been
watching you all summer.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.769
I think you're
a hunk-o-rama.''

05:35.802 --> 05:38.838
A secret admirer,
how romantic.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.841
Yeah, but who?

05:43.843 --> 05:47.580
Help, help!
My friend's getting beat up
behind the snack stand. Hurry!

05:47.614 --> 05:49.949
Don't worry kid,
I'll save him.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.118
Doofus.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.421
So, hot stuff,
live around here?

05:54.454 --> 05:57.724
- Excuse me?
- Hey,
I'm a guy, you're a girl,

05:57.757 --> 06:00.160
- it's only natural.
- How old are you?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.762
A mature 11.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.864
Oh, gotta jet.
Call me, babe.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.634
Don't worry if my mom answers.
I let her stay with me.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.505
Hey, there was no fight.
Where is that kid?

06:12.539 --> 06:15.608
That was no kid,
that was the next Zack Morris.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.847
Jessie, did you come up with
any ideas for
a sand sculpture?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.583
Yeah, Lisa and I are
going to do a sandcastle.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.086
Hey, I've got an idea.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.787
Why don't we get
all the members together

06:27.821 --> 06:29.756
and build one
giant sandcastle?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.425
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Yeah,
we'll just take this one

06:32.459 --> 06:35.095
- and expand it, huh?
- ( phone rings )

06:35.128 --> 06:37.430
Malibu Sands Beach Club.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.738
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy?

06:44.771 --> 06:47.207
Didn't I tell you,
stay away from him?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.843
I'm not a little kid anymore.
You can't tell me

06:49.876 --> 06:52.545
- who to be friends with.
- Oh, yes I can.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.647
I'm your father, and as long
as you're under my roof,

06:54.681 --> 06:56.750
you'll do as I say.
You're grounded!

06:56.783 --> 06:59.085
You can't ground me.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.055
I'm moving out.
Jessie,
may I stay with you guys?

07:02.088 --> 07:05.025
- It's Lisa's house...
- Great!
I'll be there tonight!

07:05.058 --> 07:07.060
- Go ahead. Won't bother me.
- Fine!

07:07.093 --> 07:08.828
Fine!

07:17.637 --> 07:19.639
Okay, everybody, listen up.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.043
Gather around.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.079
Okay, you all know what part
of the castle to work on,

07:26.112 --> 07:29.549
so if you have any questions,
just ask me or Stacy.
All right?

07:29.582 --> 07:33.319
Hey, Zack,
do you think the Brady Bunch
with ever get back together?

07:33.353 --> 07:37.323
I meant questions
about the sandcastle, dork.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.160
Come on, everybody,
let's make this
the best castle

07:40.193 --> 07:42.762
- in Malibu Sands history.
- All: Yeah!

07:44.664 --> 07:47.067
( clears throat )

07:47.100 --> 07:49.235
Hi, Billy. How ya doing?
What's up?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.271
Would you go with me
to my Little League banquet?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.106
Oh, that's so sweet.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.108
You're looking at
''Little
Slugger of the Year.''

07:55.141 --> 07:58.378
Billy, you're really cute
and I'm very flattered,

07:58.411 --> 08:01.348
but I can't go out with you.
You're just a little boy.

08:01.381 --> 08:05.385
A little boy?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.154
Oh, Billy, wait.
I didn't mean...

08:08.188 --> 08:09.155
( sighs )

08:09.189 --> 08:12.359
Don't worry, Kelly,
he'll get over it...

08:12.392 --> 08:14.661
after many years
of therapy.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.806
Ow!
What the heck!

08:32.312 --> 08:34.681
''Dear Slater,
I want to meet you,

08:34.714 --> 08:37.517
but I don't know how.
I love you.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.686
Your secret admirer.''

08:39.719 --> 08:42.121
Oh, come on!
Who loves me?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.491
Well, I do,
but only as a friend.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.165
- Hello, Stacy.
- Hello, Father.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.167
Did we get the coconuts
for the luau, yet?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.836
- No, sir.
They'll be here at 4:00.
- Thank you.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.673
Well, Mr. Carosi, what do you
think of our new sandcastle?

08:59.706 --> 09:03.043
- It's different, right?
- Is this your idea, Morris?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.078
No, not entirely.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.281
Your very
talented and beautiful
daughter helped too, sir.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.417
I don't like it.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.293
Zack: It's beautiful
tonight, isn't it?

09:20.326 --> 09:23.697
It is?
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.733
You all right?

09:26.766 --> 09:29.102
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

09:29.135 --> 09:32.472
I don't know.
You seem so... distracted.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.308
I mean, when we were
having dinner,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.310
you didn't notice
that a chandelier
fell in your soup.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.379
Get out of here.
That didn't happen.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.115
Ah... so you were noticing.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.118
I'm sorry.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.420
( sighs ) I just hate
fighting with my dad.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.889
I only have one more
day with him.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.626
What about me?

09:53.660 --> 09:56.229
I only have one more
day with you.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.566
I'm sorry.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.711
Come on.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.514
( soft music playing )

10:16.616 --> 10:18.818
Welcome
to the Moonlight Ballroom.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.589
- May I have this dance?
- That would be nice.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.537
Stacy, this isn't working.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.446
Your body is here...

10:46.479 --> 10:47.847
which I like...

10:47.881 --> 10:51.317
but your mind,
your mind is with your father.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.753
Why don't you just
make up with him?

10:53.787 --> 10:56.489
Why should I back down
when I'm right?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.658
Whose side
are you on, anyway?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.061
Yours. Yours of course.
I just...

11:02.395 --> 11:04.564
I just want you
to be happy.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.234
Yeah, well, when you
figure out how, let me know.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.942
Mr. Carosi, good morning.
What can I get for you?

11:15.975 --> 11:19.846
You can get lost.
I sat at this booth so you
wouldn't wait on me.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.550
I switched with Screech
so I could. What would you
like for breakfast?

11:23.583 --> 11:28.555
You out of my life,
my daughter back home,
and sausage well done.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.091
Mr. Carosi,
I think we need to talk.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.326
I have nothing
to say to you, Morris.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.795
It's your fault
Stacy won't talk to me.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.998
As different as we both are
we do have one
thing in common.

11:39.099 --> 11:44.337
The only thing we have
in common is that neither
one of us is Elvis.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.441
- No, we both love Stacy.
- Please, I haven't eaten yet.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.677
I'm serious, sir.
You should talk to her.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.113
I'd like to, but she's
the one that ran away.

11:53.113 --> 11:57.117
If she doesn't come around,
I guess I won't talk
to her until next...

11:57.117 --> 11:59.119
next summer.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.520
Mr. Carosi, I can see...

12:00.553 --> 12:03.423
Forget the breakfast!
The food here stinks!

12:04.924 --> 12:06.960
You're fired!

12:16.736 --> 12:20.206
Heads up! Carosi's on
the warpath and he's taking
it out on everyone.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.676
So whatever you do,
don't mention Stacy.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.880
Hi, sir. Nice weather.
How's the family?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.682
Oops.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.752
<i>Buenos dias, Senor</i> Carosi.
How's boss today?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.688
Boss lousy today.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.524
- Roberto.
<i>- Si?</i>

12:37.557 --> 12:39.259
How many times
have I told you,
meat on the left,

12:39.292 --> 12:42.462
- potatoes on the right?
<i>- Si.</i> Sorry, sir.

12:45.665 --> 12:49.269
- That's better, boss?
- Better.
Don't let it happen again.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.475
( dishes clattering )

12:59.679 --> 13:01.781
Roberto... Ah!

13:01.815 --> 13:05.418
- Why are these knifes wet?
- Because they
just washed them.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.187
Duh!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.356
How long have
you owned this place?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.790
( growls )

13:10.824 --> 13:14.327
Mr. Carosi, we need you out in
the dining room for
the staff picture.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.964
Forget it, Morris.
I'm needed in here.
This place is falling apart.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.600
Well, Stacy
will be very disappointed.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.969
- She really wants you in it.
- Oh, Stacy, huh?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.205
Well, all right.
As long as it's quick.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.307
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Okay.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.481
So, did you tell Stacy
about the picture?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.283
Oh yeah,
and your idea worked great.
As soon as I told her

13:37.317 --> 13:39.853
Carosi wanted her in it,
she started fixing her hair.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.989
All right, great.
All right everybody,
picture time.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.392
Come on.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.968
- Hi.
- Hello.

13:58.772 --> 14:02.208
Zack: Uh... no, no.
This isn't right.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.478
Slater, why don't you move
to the other side of Mr.
Carosi?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.948
Kelly, why don't you
move down in front?

14:09.049 --> 14:12.352
Jessie, why don't you
trade places with Stacy?

14:15.555 --> 14:18.491
- How do you focus this thing?
- Excuse me.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.594
Let me see it, Preppie.
Let me see it. Step aside.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.330
It's my camera,
I'll do it.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.433
Do you have
any film in there?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.268
Oh!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.781
So, I heard you
wanted me in the picture.

14:41.815 --> 14:45.085
Me? Zack said
you wanted me in it.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.089
Zack? I think
we've been set up, Dad.

14:49.089 --> 14:53.093
Ha! Little con artist probably
got us together so
we'd start talking.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.628
- We are talking.
- Huh... oh, yeah.

14:57.364 --> 15:01.334
He's so sweet.
All he cared about
was getting us back together.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.270
Honey, I'm...
( clears throat )

15:04.304 --> 15:06.740
I'm sorry.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.909
It was wrong of me
to tell you who
to go out with.

15:09.943 --> 15:14.347
I'm sorry I ran away.
That doesn't solve anything.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.816
- Come here, honey bunny.
- Okay, Papa bear.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.956
- Zack: Hold that pose.
- Huh?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.060
Pretty sneaky, Morris.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.595
All right, get back to work.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.331
Okay, but first let's do
that group picture for real.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.667
- All: Yeah!
- Slater: All right.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.769
Zack: All right,
it's going.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.874
Thanks, Zack.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.085
( horn playing )

15:55.689 --> 15:58.091
( applause )

16:09.669 --> 16:13.506
- Interesting
enough for you, Dad?
- We are impressed.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.078
Woman:
Help! Help!

16:18.111 --> 16:20.380
Save me!

16:22.649 --> 16:25.418
- Somebody's drowning!
- Hey, it's a chick.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.487
Kelly, I got this one.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.633
- I hope she's not a member.
- Don't worry, Mr. Carosi.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.802
Slater's the best
lifeguard on the beach.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.405
Zack: He'll save her...
'cause she's cute.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.712
- What the...
- I feel stupid!

16:52.746 --> 16:54.848
I faked
the whole drowning.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.950
You know those notes?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.085
You mean
you're my secret admirer?

16:59.085 --> 17:01.855
Well, how come you
just didn't tell
me how you felt?

17:01.888 --> 17:04.691
- What if you didn't like me?
- What, are you kidding?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.726
Besides being cute,

17:06.760 --> 17:10.063
you're the first
girl without dentures
to hit on me all summer.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.832
Would you like to go
to the luau with me tonight?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.835
Yes, definitely.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.704
But first, will you
finish rescuing me?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.674
Sure.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.182
( crowd cheering )

17:35.555 --> 17:37.590
( rock music playing )

18:03.149 --> 18:06.152
Lisa,
I want to thank your parents
for the wonderful tip.

18:06.186 --> 18:10.023
It would have been a lot more,
but I saw a blouse
on sale at the mall.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.892
How come she gets a tip
and I don't?

18:12.926 --> 18:16.029
Oh, I'm sorry, Screech.
I almost forgot.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.833
- Here.
- A coconut?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.469
Wow! These make
great key chains.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.738
( chuckles ) Whatever you say.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.542
Aloha, dudes.
Meet Cynthia.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.778
She's the chick
I rescued this afternoon.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.848
It's just too bad
it took all summer
for you guys to get together.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.551
No, it's okay. She just moved
to town and she's
going to Bayside.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.620
Come on, babe,
let's get a burger.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.057
Chick? Babe? Are you
gonna take that from him?

18:44.057 --> 18:47.761
With dimples like those,
he can say whatever he wants.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.903
I'll see you guys later.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.679
Is this sand taken?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.081
Why would you want
to sit with a little kid?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.551
Because you're
a cool little kid,

19:11.584 --> 19:14.921
and just because I'm older
doesn't mean we
can't be friends.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.623
What do you say?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.025
Well, okay, but...

19:19.059 --> 19:21.061
can I call you
when I'm 17?

19:21.094 --> 19:23.129
You'd better.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.038
Attention, please, everyone!

19:32.072 --> 19:35.108
As we close another summer
at Malibu Sands

19:35.141 --> 19:37.911
I'm reminded
of our first year.

19:37.944 --> 19:42.649
- I made 30%
profit that summer.
- Dad, get on with it.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.552
I want to thank the staff.
You kids did a great job

19:45.585 --> 19:48.288
and you're all welcome
back here next year.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.956
( cheering )

19:52.892 --> 19:55.829
Now everybody
enjoy the luau.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.374
- Morris,
I'd like a word with you.
- Yes, Mr. Carosi?

20:07.407 --> 20:10.910
You heard me
talking about the kids
coming back next summer,

20:10.944 --> 20:14.014
working here?
That especially means you.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.284
- Thank you, sir.
- You're all right, Zack.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.255
You're not so bad
yourself... Papa bear.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.729
Almost forgot.
Here.

20:29.763 --> 20:32.365
- What's this?
- Tips for all
those breakfasts

20:32.399 --> 20:35.001
I stiffed you on.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.237
You earned it.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.041
I think someone's
waiting for you.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.236
So...

21:10.270 --> 21:12.872
you're really
going to leave, huh?

21:12.906 --> 21:16.743
Yeah. Dad's taking me
to the airport
in a few minutes.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.748
Can't believe you're not
going to be here tomorrow.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.817
Me neither.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.454
What am I going
to do without you?

21:29.089 --> 21:32.125
Well, I'll be back
for Thanksgiving

21:32.158 --> 21:34.961
and maybe you can
come east for Christmas.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.866
Let's write... every day.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.737
- I love you.
- I love you.

21:56.216 --> 21:58.485
I have to go.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.955
Later, dude.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.361
Bye.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.888
You need a friend?

22:35.889 --> 22:38.091
It wouldn't hurt.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.427
How about five friends?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.182
( instrumental
theme music playing )
