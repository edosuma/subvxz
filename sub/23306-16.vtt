That almost encases the snake.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.688
{\an3}For me,
the negative to the tattoo

21:54.771 --> 21:56.898
is gonna be the power of
the relationship between

21:56.982 --> 21:58.400
{\an3}the size of the head
of the dragon,

21:58.483 --> 22:01.611
{\an3}and the dragon's power,
versus the size of the eagle.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.905
I just wish that
the eagle's head

22:03.989 --> 22:05.907
wasn't the same size
as the dragon's head.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.576

was swooping down

22:11.621 --> 22:12.914

22:12.998 --> 22:15.125
and you had more of
an entanglement,

22:15.208 --> 22:17.419
but where you have
the dark blacks coming out,

22:17.502 --> 22:19.087
and the color just
blasting through that

22:19.171 --> 22:20.505
and getting really bright,

22:20.589 --> 22:21.923
you show a lot of dimension,
you show a lot of flow.

Technically, this tattoo is
really smooth, really soft.

It gets a little hard to read

{\an3}Juan's snake, Juan's dragon,
Juan's eagle,

25:41.539 --> 25:43.291
{\an3}they're all jacked
anatomically.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.585
- Juan's tattoo is readable

25:45.669 --> 25:47.170
and has every single piece
of the body.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.296
- Look at those feet.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.465
It looks like one, two,
three eagle feet.

25:50.548 --> 25:51.925
- At least you can see
the feet.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.093
- But Juan's tattoo is legible.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.303
- Josh did it super big,

25:55.387 --> 25:56.638
and it's still not
as readable as Juan's.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.639
- Follow the snake and tell me
you can see that, Matt.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.641

- Absolutely. Absolutely.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.059

Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.395
{\an3}- Honestly, like, he hit
so many of the benchmarks.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.480

26:05.563 --> 26:08.316
and color is solid.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.276

every single piece!

26:10.860 --> 26:12.988

- Composition.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.906
It's a snake versus a chicken
versus a Muppet.

That's what I see
when I look at this tattoo.

when we talk about tattoos?

26:19.327 --> 26:20.704

26:20.787 --> 26:23.873
- Well, while they continue
to hash it out,

26:23.957 --> 26:25.458
it's the moment
that I personally

26:25.542 --> 26:26.918

26:27.002 --> 26:28.670

26:28.753 --> 26:30.880

26:30.964 --> 26:33.466

26:33.550 --> 26:36.011

26:36.094 --> 26:38.179
and based on
these tattoos alone,

26:38.263 --> 26:40.932
the judges will put
the second coach

26:41.016 --> 26:42.392
into the top two.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.154
Tell us about your tattoo, man.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.196
- Shape of the head,

26:55.280 --> 26:56.948
{\an1}I just wanted something
that flowed a lot.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.034
I wanted this thing readable
from 10 feet away,

26:59.117 --> 27:00.243
and every way you look at it,

27:00.327 --> 27:01.202
I wanted you to see
something different.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.287
- It's really dynamic.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.621
It really fits
the shape of the head.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.332
You've got a lot of detail
in there.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.001
- You always are able
to show off with texture.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.420
You're able to show off
with the depth of shading

27:10.503 --> 27:11.713
that you get in your tattoos.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.673
One of my favorite parts
is the bottom,

27:13.757 --> 27:15.759
with the little demon face
that you have down there.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.552
That rich black
really comes out

27:17.635 --> 27:18.845
off the light grays.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.306
- There's no denying
this is a badass tattoo.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.850

27:34.778 --> 27:37.572
Anthony, what was the thought
process behind this tattoo?

27:37.655 --> 27:40.075
- Balance, intention,
and unity.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.911
You know, I'm not a Polynesian
tattooer by any means,

27:42.994 --> 27:45.747
but I wanted to pay respects
to the culture,

27:45.830 --> 27:47.916
and to the craft,
how tattooing started.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.502
With the King's blessing,
of Polynesia,

27:50.585 --> 27:52.087
this is our journey.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.881
- The design, the layout,
the detail is over the top.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.175
- The style of tattooing
that you do on here

27:57.258 --> 27:59.469
is very dark,

27:59.552 --> 28:01.930
and it doesn't have
a lot of loose skin breaks

28:02.013 --> 28:02.639
that we always look for.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.557
And with that being said,

28:04.641 --> 28:07.102
it plays so strong
and so perfect still.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.312
Looking at the tools
and the symmetry,

28:09.396 --> 28:11.564
the way the tattooing tools
are lined up,

28:11.648 --> 28:13.775
with those circles
that you have over the top,

28:13.858 --> 28:14.734
are beautiful.

28:14.818 --> 28:15.902
The negative space that goes

28:15.985 --> 28:18.613
perfectly echoes one side
of the ear to the other,

28:18.696 --> 28:21.658
and brings it up
to cast the shapes

28:21.741 --> 28:24.035
for the portraits to sit in,
are beautiful.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.912
And the portrait quality
on these,

28:25.995 --> 28:29.165

straight down--

he's got a mask
on the top of his head

that slides up.

29:03.741 --> 29:05.326
The tassels ride the side.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.830
And I also wanted pieces
that went together

29:08.913 --> 29:11.291

29:11.374 --> 29:13.418
from top to back.

29:13.501 --> 29:14.752
When he's walking backwards,

29:14.836 --> 29:15.837
people think that's a skeleton

29:15.920 --> 29:17.839
with a third eye
with his brain cut out.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.675

at this guy's head,

29:20.758 --> 29:21.843
there's something going on

29:21.926 --> 29:23.845

there's no doubt
that thing is super tight.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.184
That's super clean.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.518
- To me, the top of the head

29:30.602 --> 29:32.770
is really, really,
really strong.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.689
When we get down
and we get to the skull,

29:34.772 --> 29:35.482
the way that you have
those negative pieces

29:35.565 --> 29:36.858
that come out of the eyes

29:36.941 --> 29:39.277
and come onto the side
of the head, beautiful.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.863
What gets me on this one

29:41.946 --> 29:44.199
is just the halos
that you have on the lines,

29:44.282 --> 29:46.367
up on the top of the flower
on both sides of the shoulder.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.662

the blowouts in the flower.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.039
You've put some shading--
- This right here?

29:51.122 --> 29:52.707
- You've put some shading
to hide it,

29:52.790 --> 29:54.209
but you can see 'em.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.418
- That shade is

in every tattoo

29:58.046 --> 29:59.506

about this thing

30:05.428 --> 30:07.388
is the layout
and the illustration

it is so much cleaner,

30:55.937 --> 30:58.439

All right, we are not done yet.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.300
Juan and Josh,

34:12.382 --> 34:14.469
you've made it to the top two,

34:14.552 --> 34:16.971
but only one of you
will win $100,000,

34:17.054 --> 34:19.639
a feature in "Inked" magazine,

34:19.724 --> 34:21.266
and the title of Ink Master.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.643
- This a really tough one,

34:22.726 --> 34:24.645
{\an3}just for the fact that
each one of you guys have

34:24.728 --> 34:26.188
{\an3}one piece of this
that is bothersome,

34:26.272 --> 34:28.608
{\an3}and then you have
other pieces of this thing

34:28.690 --> 34:30.150
that's really strong.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.527
I wish Juan's dragon
was more powerful,

34:32.612 --> 34:35.239
and I think Josh's eagle head
in the sternum

34:35.322 --> 34:36.532
is very camouflaged.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.117
- For me, as big as Josh went,

34:38.201 --> 34:39.577
it lends it to be
a lot more breathable.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.914
I think Juan's positioning of
the eagle is a little bit off,

34:42.996 --> 34:45.500
but technically Juan's tattoo
is so smooth and soft.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.668
- I think that Josh has
more saturation.

34:47.752 --> 34:48.628
{\an1}- Yeah, it's two different
styles of tattooing,

34:48.710 --> 34:51.172
