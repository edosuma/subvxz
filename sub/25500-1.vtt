Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:59.535 --> 02:00.785
Shit!

02:18.452 --> 02:21.883
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

02:21.885 --> 02:24.968
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

02:28.748 --> 02:31.861
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

02:58.570 --> 03:03.570
What was this?

03:07.558 --> 03:09.058
What does he want?

03:18.417 --> 03:20.696
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

03:30.255 --> 03:33.338
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

03:39.416 --> 03:42.672
Hello?

03:42.674 --> 03:46.174
Hello?

04:06.800 --> 04:07.800
Who's there?

04:10.221 --> 04:11.054
Hello?

04:14.412 --> 04:15.245
Hello?

04:58.124 --> 05:02.957
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

06:11.143 --> 06:14.143
Tatik, tell me about your tattoos.

06:27.092 --> 06:30.118
But grandma, you never
told me who gave them to you?

07:02.411 --> 07:04.744
Okay, okay, sorry grandma.

07:08.945 --> 07:11.982
Grandma, you said your
family was rich in Turkey?

08:36.861 --> 08:37.693
Yes.

08:44.929 --> 08:45.876
What about after you left?

08:45.878 --> 08:46.753
What happened then?

08:46.755 --> 08:48.088
Do you remember?

08:57.536 --> 08:58.878
What about after?

08:58.880 --> 09:01.113
What happened after you left?

09:01.115 --> 09:02.483
Did you have enough food or water?

09:02.485 --> 09:04.778
Did the guards tell you
where they were taking you?

09:17.625 --> 09:18.456
Disappeared?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.198
What-what do you mean?

09:24.228 --> 09:25.223
You don't remember what happened

09:25.225 --> 09:26.728
after your mother disappeared?

09:33.762 --> 09:36.772
Oh, I, I didn't know
we had Turkish relatives.

09:47.305 --> 09:51.588
Grandma, did your uncle
gave you those tattoos?

10:02.140 --> 10:04.733
It doesn't make any sense.

10:04.735 --> 10:06.863
Mom freaked out when I
wanted to get a tiny tat,

10:06.865 --> 10:09.523
tiny ankle tattoo, and now you're saying

10:09.525 --> 10:11.273
Armenian children 100 years ago

10:11.275 --> 10:13.378
all had tattoos on their hands?

10:24.401 --> 10:26.734
Grandma, it is for school!

10:29.365 --> 10:32.164
Tatik...

10:42.985 --> 10:46.033
I've been doing a lot of research and...

10:46.035 --> 10:48.003
Those tattoos are the
markings that were given

10:48.005 --> 10:50.755
to the women and children
during the Armenian genocide.

10:52.965 --> 10:56.148
Some of them signified belonging
to a master as a slave.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.528
In many cases, as a sex slave.

11:01.085 --> 11:02.563
My grandma's 108 years old.

11:02.565 --> 11:03.613
She...

11:03.615 --> 11:05.313
It's very common in our family.

11:05.315 --> 11:06.613
Her sister died a year ago.

11:06.615 --> 11:10.053
She was almost 100 years old.

11:10.055 --> 11:12.983
They are some of the last
few remaining survivors

11:12.985 --> 11:15.483
of the Armenian genocide that took place

11:15.485 --> 11:17.298
during the first World War.

11:20.235 --> 11:24.813
Not many left, as it happened
exactly 100 years ago today.

11:24.815 --> 11:25.863
Maro-jan!

11:25.865 --> 11:26.873
Dinner!

11:26.875 --> 11:28.423
I'm busy, mom!

11:28.425 --> 11:29.323
So am I!

11:29.325 --> 11:30.718
It's getting cold!

11:32.945 --> 11:35.803
Today is April 24th, 2015.

11:35.805 --> 11:39.043
The 100th anniversary of
the Armenian genocide.

11:39.045 --> 11:43.083
1.5 million Armenian
women, children and men

11:43.085 --> 11:45.608
were slaughtered by
the Turkish Government.

11:47.577 --> 11:48.959
Maro, now!

11:48.961 --> 11:49.794
Ugh!

11:58.535 --> 12:00.083
Babe?

12:00.085 --> 12:01.108
Are you home?

12:02.261 --> 12:03.258
I've been knocking.

12:16.575 --> 12:19.493
I sent you like 100 text messages.

12:19.495 --> 12:20.328
Sevan?

12:22.530 --> 12:25.238
Babe, I thought we weren't
even gonna do this.

12:27.015 --> 12:28.065
Hide from each other.

12:29.505 --> 12:32.088
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

12:32.945 --> 12:34.243
You know?

12:34.245 --> 12:35.748
You can tell me anything.

12:56.013 --> 12:58.088
Something terrible happened today.

12:59.265 --> 13:01.693
One of my cousins was found
dead by his girlfriend

13:01.695 --> 13:03.233
in his home.

13:03.235 --> 13:06.033
I don't know the details,
but I overheard it was either

13:06.035 --> 13:08.908
a heart attack, or a seizure of some sort.

13:10.225 --> 13:11.433
My parents never tell me anything.

13:11.435 --> 13:13.519
They-they still I'm a child.

13:14.354 --> 13:16.345
I guess that's their way of protecting me.

13:17.935 --> 13:19.468
My grandma's still in shock.

13:20.795 --> 13:21.626
But...

13:21.628 --> 13:23.393
But I suspect there's something
they're not telling me

13:23.395 --> 13:26.303
because when we heard from Sevan's father,

13:26.305 --> 13:30.520
my grandma said, and-and I
repeat word for word, she said,

13:30.522 --> 13:32.973
"It is finally here."

13:32.975 --> 13:34.643
My parents think she's just in shock,

13:34.645 --> 13:37.310
but what does it mean?

13:37.312 --> 13:40.173
"It is finally here"?

13:40.175 --> 13:41.423
Maro-jan!

13:41.425 --> 13:43.453
It's not the time for computers!

13:43.455 --> 13:45.192
Go help your grandma!

13:45.194 --> 13:46.027
Ugh!

13:55.432 --> 13:56.265
Tatik?

13:58.494 --> 14:02.383
Keep what promise?

14:02.385 --> 14:03.218
Grandma?

14:07.545 --> 14:08.376
What are saying?

14:08.378 --> 14:09.828
What-what curse?

14:11.972 --> 14:12.805
Tatik?

14:15.275 --> 14:16.838
How are you feeling, grandma?

14:19.205 --> 14:20.768
Is there really a curse?

14:38.916 --> 14:40.183
What did I tell you?

14:40.185 --> 14:43.135
Something is really wrong here,
and they're not telling me.

14:44.225 --> 14:46.713
Grandma threw a towel at me.

14:46.715 --> 14:48.398
She's never laid a hand on me.

14:50.395 --> 14:52.838
That's how I know something's wrong.

14:53.735 --> 14:57.131
They're not telling me
something, the whole family.

15:02.445 --> 15:03.278
Mom!

15:09.145 --> 15:11.323
Maro, you know...

15:11.325 --> 15:13.518
I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.448
I know you're heartbroken.

15:17.495 --> 15:20.518
Clara, the whole family's in shock.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.808
My grandma had an incident a few days ago.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.958
Please, do this for Sevan?

15:31.085 --> 15:35.643
Weeks before his death,
Sevan had become withdrawn.

15:35.645 --> 15:38.423
I thought he was getting
cold feet about us.

15:38.425 --> 15:39.853
Again.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.043
Sevan started talking about the curse

15:42.045 --> 15:44.393
that his family carried,

15:44.395 --> 15:46.893
and that it was just a matter of time

15:46.895 --> 15:48.753
before every member of the bloodline

15:48.755 --> 15:51.008
would have to face the consequences.

15:53.705 --> 15:54.536
A curse?

15:54.538 --> 15:56.208
Did he say what kind of a curse?

15:57.185 --> 15:58.743
I thought he was teasing me.

15:58.745 --> 15:59.873
I don't know.

15:59.875 --> 16:00.883
Think hard, Clara.

16:00.885 --> 16:02.603
I don't remember!

16:02.605 --> 16:03.603
Try to remember.

16:03.605 --> 16:05.833
Why are you doing this?

16:05.835 --> 16:07.358
I have to figure this out!

16:08.915 --> 16:13.483
After Sevan was found dead,
I overheard my grandma

16:13.485 --> 16:15.373
talking to herself about...

16:15.375 --> 16:17.618
A promise they didn't keep, and the curse.

16:19.548 --> 16:22.573
Maro, she is a 100 year old woman.

16:22.575 --> 16:24.103
She's probably delusional.

16:24.105 --> 16:25.223
108.

16:25.225 --> 16:26.353
You don't know her.

16:26.355 --> 16:28.278
She's as sharp as a kabob skewer.

16:30.035 --> 16:31.418
Did he say anything else?

16:35.065 --> 16:36.808
It's all so hazy now.

16:38.195 --> 16:40.928
Look, I have to figure
out what happened to Sevan.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.588
Think, Clara.

16:48.735 --> 16:52.293
One day, we were at a restaurant,

16:52.295 --> 16:53.958
and Sevan got a phone call.

16:55.325 --> 16:57.338
He was very secretive about it.

16:58.485 --> 17:02.515
When he went to the men's room, I...

17:03.495 --> 17:04.858
Looked through his cell.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.805
The last call he got was from...

17:10.698 --> 17:12.298
A psychic named Aida.

17:14.395 --> 17:15.613
A psychic?

17:15.615 --> 17:18.242
Yes, you know, the clairvoyant?

17:18.244 --> 17:20.323
I know what a psychic is but,

17:20.325 --> 17:22.242
but Sevan didn't seem
like that kind of a guy...

17:22.244 --> 17:23.772
Exactly.

17:23.775 --> 17:25.502
Did you ask him about it?

17:25.505 --> 17:27.913
He said I wouldn't understand.

17:27.915 --> 17:30.103
And then, something about his family

17:30.105 --> 17:31.715
escaping Turkey in 1915.

17:38.923 --> 17:39.756
Maro?

17:43.165 --> 17:44.138
I gotta go.

17:47.125 --> 17:47.958
Maro?

17:52.805 --> 17:55.643
I've looked into every
psychic in LA named Aida.

17:55.645 --> 17:58.663
There are literally 35 of them.

17:58.665 --> 18:01.203
Who knows if that's even their real name?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.013
After sifting through
all of these charlatans,

18:03.015 --> 18:06.153
I came across one Aida
that hit all the marks.

18:06.155 --> 18:06.986
Armenian?

18:06.988 --> 18:07.973
Check.

18:07.975 --> 18:09.053
Does coffee readings?

18:09.055 --> 18:09.886
Check.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.333
Lives in North Hollywood?

18:11.335 --> 18:12.573
Check.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.293
She might be able to
provide some information

18:14.295 --> 18:17.188
about Sevan's last days
and this so-called curse.

18:20.425 --> 18:21.853
I don't even know if I
believe in any of this

18:21.855 --> 18:23.768
superstitious mumbo-jumbo.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.406
Ugh, I can't believe I have
to drive to the Valley...

18:43.455 --> 18:45.705
25 bucks, and you can't
afford better coffee?

18:47.745 --> 18:51.233
If you came here for
coffee, go to Starbucks.

18:51.235 --> 18:54.333
There's one on Sherman
Way, around the corner.

18:54.335 --> 18:55.168
Now drink up.

19:05.115 --> 19:05.948
What now?

19:06.918 --> 19:07.828
Now, we wait.

19:16.725 --> 19:18.043
I'm just being straightforward.

19:18.045 --> 19:21.308
I'm not sure that I believe
in any of this abracadabra.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.573
Is that so?

19:23.575 --> 19:26.570
So why are you here?

19:26.572 --> 19:30.023
You spoke to my cousin
Sevan a few weeks ago.

19:30.025 --> 19:31.125
What did you tell him?

19:32.265 --> 19:36.083
I never betray my
clients' confidentiality.

19:36.085 --> 19:38.883
I have dozens of Sevans
walking through that door

19:38.885 --> 19:40.238
on a weekly basis.

19:41.585 --> 19:43.835
This one died
a couple of weeks ago.

19:57.554 --> 19:59.734
You need to start talking,

19:59.736 --> 20:01.493
or I will have to ask you to leave.

20:01.495 --> 20:02.328
No refund.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.783
My cousin Sevan died
shortly after he visited you.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.273
They said he had a heart attack.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.883
But I know there's something
they're not telling me.

20:11.885 --> 20:14.273
What did he say when he was here?

20:14.275 --> 20:15.375
What did you tell him?

20:16.865 --> 20:19.653
Nobody listens to what I have to say.

20:19.655 --> 20:22.443
They come here, they pay for my advice,

20:22.445 --> 20:24.195
but nobody ever listens.

20:27.255 --> 20:32.255
Sevan had all the signs of
a marked man, a cursed man.

20:33.935 --> 20:34.878
I read for him.

20:35.795 --> 20:37.323
I told him the truth.

20:37.325 --> 20:41.663
I always tell the truth,
no matter how bad it is.

20:41.665 --> 20:42.735
His coffee...

20:43.695 --> 20:46.088
It had a loop in it,
circling around like a snake.

20:48.394 --> 20:52.092
Like a noose, ready to
squeeze at the right moment.

20:54.235 --> 20:55.908
Tell me more about the curse.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.772
Your family had been
cursed a long, long time ago.

21:02.785 --> 21:03.878
A sleeper curse.

21:05.155 --> 21:06.558
Sleeper curse?

21:08.382 --> 21:12.068
A curse placed by a
very patient person...

21:13.245 --> 21:16.268
Is usually brought on by
the victims themselves.

21:17.995 --> 21:19.228
What-what does that mean?

21:23.245 --> 21:25.828
You are a part of this curse.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.030
The loop is tightening.

21:44.650 --> 21:45.713
What about the promise?

21:45.715 --> 21:47.943
What promise?

21:47.945 --> 21:49.259
Was there a promise?

21:51.405 --> 21:54.733
You must go now!

21:54.735 --> 21:56.403
No, not until you answer me!

21:56.405 --> 21:57.236
Get out!

21:57.238 --> 21:59.033
Get out of my house now!

21:59.035 --> 22:00.823
Tell me about the promise!

22:00.825 --> 22:04.852
It's all in the family,
the family, the family...

23:24.642 --> 23:26.203
Maro-jan?

23:26.205 --> 23:28.414
Why are you awake?

23:28.416 --> 23:30.028
Oh, bad dream.

23:31.242 --> 23:33.313
You and the whole family.

23:33.315 --> 23:34.588
Come sit with your father.

23:36.585 --> 23:37.977
It's on, dad.

23:37.979 --> 23:38.812
Oh.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.198
Sometimes I question my sanity.

23:45.235 --> 23:48.538
Sometimes I feel like the
whole world has gone mad.

23:50.725 --> 23:52.723
It's been 100 years,

23:52.725 --> 23:55.525
but the Armenian people are
still searching for answers.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.508
They say we should move
on, but how can we?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.164
The Turkish government

24:03.166 --> 24:05.288
still has not accepted the responsibility.

24:06.395 --> 24:11.348
But, mark my word,
nothing goes unpunished.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.525
Not something like this.

24:16.013 --> 24:18.213
The Armenian people
will have their answers.

24:19.205 --> 24:20.555
We just need to be patient.

24:23.285 --> 24:24.473
Dad, has grandma told you

24:24.475 --> 24:27.576
about her experience in Turkey?

24:27.578 --> 24:29.768
I've told you all you needed to know.

24:31.265 --> 24:33.653
By the way, how did your school report go?

24:33.655 --> 24:36.246
The professor said it was one-sided.

24:36.248 --> 24:38.583
Dad, there was a specific detail

24:38.585 --> 24:40.548
that grandma is leaving off.

24:41.475 --> 24:43.123
Was there a promise made?

24:43.125 --> 24:44.763
And if so, was it kept?

24:44.765 --> 24:46.613
Who-who was the promise made to?

24:46.615 --> 24:47.913
W-when did this happen?

24:47.915 --> 24:49.923
- Who are these people?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:49.925 --> 24:52.179
So many questions.

24:52.181 --> 24:53.181
Settle down.

24:54.277 --> 24:55.613
You're making my head spin.

24:55.615 --> 24:57.353
Sorry, there's just...

24:57.355 --> 24:58.818
So much void in this story.

25:01.775 --> 25:03.883
First of all, you have
to quit asking grandma

25:03.885 --> 25:05.248
about those tats.

25:06.485 --> 25:08.243
You're a big girl.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.998
By now you've figured out what they mean.

25:13.765 --> 25:18.525
For an Armenian woman,
to talk about rape...

25:19.805 --> 25:24.378
Is like betraying all the
generations of women before her.

25:27.095 --> 25:29.018
Being a woman is very sacred.

25:35.985 --> 25:39.603
Her-her memory with these events

25:39.605 --> 25:42.188
is becoming more muddled over the years.

25:44.425 --> 25:46.875
But there is something
that has stuck in my head.

25:48.455 --> 25:49.625
She said...

25:51.210 --> 25:55.443
There was a man who sacrificed
his seat on the boat

25:55.445 --> 25:58.128
for grandma and her pregnant mother.

26:00.005 --> 26:02.663
They were crossing the
river the night before

26:02.665 --> 26:06.803
the Turkish guards entered the village.

26:06.805 --> 26:07.966
Yeah.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.748
Her dad was arrested earlier.

26:11.675 --> 26:12.748
She was only eight.

26:13.927 --> 26:16.953
So...

26:16.955 --> 26:21.818
Some of the details on that
event are not quite defined.

26:24.965 --> 26:27.521
She told me the man and her mother

26:27.523 --> 26:29.683
had a secretive conversation

26:29.685 --> 26:31.643
as he was stepping off the boat.

26:31.645 --> 26:32.945
A relative maybe?

26:34.135 --> 26:39.135
All I know is the man asked
your mom to keep the promise.

26:39.505 --> 26:42.333
I overhead Tatik,
uh, mumbling to herself

26:42.335 --> 26:43.166
before she collapsed.

26:43.168 --> 26:47.020
Something about keeping
the promise, and the curse.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.223
The curse?

26:48.225 --> 26:52.308
Yeah, the curse, and that
they didn't keep the promise.

26:54.527 --> 26:55.358
Dad, you have to help me.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.425
Is there anybody else who might know more?

27:00.270 --> 27:01.773
This might be useless to you,

27:01.775 --> 27:04.303
but your mom and your grandma

27:04.305 --> 27:06.818
have been visiting a
psychic in the Valley.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.473
What?

27:11.475 --> 27:13.225
I always tease your mom about it.

27:14.065 --> 27:18.112
You know, we're just not
those kind of people.

27:32.750 --> 27:33.583
Aida!

27:34.960 --> 27:35.793
Aida!

27:40.191 --> 27:41.024
Aida!

27:43.853 --> 27:45.443
Aida please, you have to help me!

27:45.445 --> 27:46.813
I'm not working today.

27:46.815 --> 27:48.673
I have questions about my grandmother!

27:48.675 --> 27:50.503
What did she tell you?

27:50.505 --> 27:52.003
Aida, please!

27:52.005 --> 27:53.903
I thought you didn't believe in curses.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.033
Leave me alone!

27:55.035 --> 27:56.233
You are harassing me!

27:56.235 --> 27:57.573
Please, help me!

27:57.575 --> 27:59.318
My family's in danger!

28:08.491 --> 28:09.322
Are you ready?

28:09.324 --> 28:10.578
Should I start?

28:12.545 --> 28:15.243
Your grandmother and your
mother came to my shop

28:15.245 --> 28:18.493
a few weeks ago, around
the same time Sevan,

28:18.495 --> 28:21.238
may he rest in peace, knocked on my door.

28:23.455 --> 28:26.198
They had the same
questions as you have now.

28:27.805 --> 28:30.563
I put the puzzle pieces together quickly.

28:30.565 --> 28:34.178
And I knew almost instantly
that this was a family affair.

28:35.675 --> 28:37.188
A curse of some sorts.

28:39.045 --> 28:40.293
So I was right.

28:40.295 --> 28:42.208
Sevan knew about all this.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.633
It seemed he wasn't convinced,

28:46.635 --> 28:49.793
but he told me about the
dreams he was having.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.053
Dreams he'd wake up from

28:51.055 --> 28:54.123
that would still continue moments later.

28:54.125 --> 28:55.193
Dreams?

28:55.195 --> 28:58.258
A man with broken legs and arms.

29:01.345 --> 29:02.643
It can't be.

29:02.645 --> 29:06.833
Your grandmother asked me if
I could stop a family curse.

29:06.835 --> 29:08.385
I asked her what the curse was.

29:09.275 --> 29:11.023
She told me it came from a man

29:11.025 --> 29:12.838
when she was a young girl in Turkey.

29:14.675 --> 29:18.283
Her mother broke a promise
she'd given to this man.

29:18.285 --> 29:20.238
Did you ask her what the promise was?

29:22.095 --> 29:24.923
Before she answered,
your mother stepped in and

29:24.925 --> 29:27.313
they just left.

29:27.315 --> 29:29.288
A piece of work your mother is.

29:30.645 --> 29:31.476
That's it?

29:31.478 --> 29:32.394
Nothing else?

29:32.396 --> 29:34.058
I told you all I know.

29:35.225 --> 29:38.773
Sevan didn't seem to know the
specifics of that promise,

29:38.775 --> 29:40.913
but I knew that man was doomed

29:40.915 --> 29:43.008
the minute I laid eyes on him.

29:44.285 --> 29:45.838
I told him to be careful.

29:47.065 --> 29:48.298
Nobody listens.

29:49.675 --> 29:51.758
You too, I told you.

29:53.045 --> 29:54.408
It's all in the family.

30:01.635 --> 30:04.302
You're having those dreams, huh?

30:14.925 --> 30:18.148
I loved my brother, and I do miss him.

30:20.805 --> 30:22.098
No question about it.

30:23.705 --> 30:25.138
My mom is devastated.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.978
Have you been
having strange dreams?

30:31.495 --> 30:32.673
Like what?

30:32.675 --> 30:36.313
Like scary
shit, ghosts, monsters?

30:36.315 --> 30:37.883
Not since I was four.

30:37.885 --> 30:39.273
I'm being serious.

30:39.275 --> 30:41.748
Sevan had one of those
dreams before he died.

30:43.345 --> 30:44.368
How did you know?

30:45.225 --> 30:47.208
I talked to a psychic.

30:48.205 --> 30:50.923
Oh, what are you doing, cousin?

30:50.925 --> 30:53.093
There's something suspicious
about your brother's death

30:53.095 --> 30:54.943
and I need to know the answers.

30:54.945 --> 30:57.113
What are you talking about?

30:57.115 --> 31:00.623
I overheard Tatik talking
to herself about some curse,

31:00.625 --> 31:03.378
and a promise that was made.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.743
Tatik is old as fuck, man.

31:05.745 --> 31:08.048
That's what old people
do, talk to themselves.

31:09.905 --> 31:11.703
Did he say anything to you?

31:11.705 --> 31:13.833
Did he behave in a strange way?

31:13.835 --> 31:16.513
Look, Sevan had been distant

31:16.515 --> 31:17.913
since he had that fight with dad about

31:17.915 --> 31:20.038
his non-Armenian girlfriend.

31:21.715 --> 31:23.215
Who's hot as hell, by the way.

31:24.195 --> 31:28.073
But you know our dad,
he's a hardcore Armenian.

31:28.075 --> 31:29.233
He was really fuckin' angry

31:29.235 --> 31:31.108
when Sevan brought Clara to dinner.

31:35.045 --> 31:38.000
I'm like, "It's 2015,
can we just like move on

31:38.002 --> 31:41.322
"with the whole Armenians
must marry Armenian bullshit?"

31:45.485 --> 31:49.392
After that, Sevan sort
of drifted away a little.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.988
He did let me use bimmer though.

31:57.595 --> 31:58.585
I really miss him.

32:01.235 --> 32:02.533
I gotta go, cousin.

32:02.535 --> 32:03.583
We're not done yet!

32:03.585 --> 32:06.363
Sorry, we can continue later.

32:06.365 --> 32:08.538
Hey bro, what took you so long?

32:10.635 --> 32:12.603
That little shit is lying.

32:12.605 --> 32:15.355
I can tell, he knows something.

32:15.357 --> 32:16.573
He either doesn't want
to admit it to himself

32:16.575 --> 32:19.928
that something's wrong, or
he's embarrassed to tell me.

32:20.997 --> 32:22.208
Typical Armenian guy.

32:46.415 --> 32:48.155
This fucking door...

32:55.583 --> 32:56.833
Where are they?

33:02.575 --> 33:03.408
Here you are.

33:33.493 --> 33:34.619
Oh, come on!

33:41.093 --> 33:46.093
This goddamn door!

35:44.605 --> 35:46.405
I can't believe this is happening.

35:47.295 --> 35:49.018
I just talked to him yesterday.

35:52.445 --> 35:53.598
Arsen is dead.

35:57.535 --> 35:58.943
Dead!

35:58.945 --> 36:01.573
And they-they arrested
some man in suspicion.

36:01.575 --> 36:05.663
He and my cousin had a fight
about the money he borrowed.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.715
I know it wasn't that man who killed him.

36:11.905 --> 36:13.348
The curse is here.

36:17.435 --> 36:18.932
I'm scared for my life.

36:18.934 --> 36:20.958
I'm scared for my family.

36:23.165 --> 36:25.413
There has to be something
that I can do to stop it.

36:25.415 --> 36:27.128
I-I know I can stop it.

36:30.295 --> 36:31.328
I have to find it.

36:50.926 --> 36:52.843
How are you doing, mom?

36:55.086 --> 36:57.838
To lose two children...

36:57.840 --> 37:00.628
I can't imagine what that
family is going through.

37:03.582 --> 37:06.517
I don't know what I would do if...

37:06.519 --> 37:07.350
Maro!

37:08.446 --> 37:09.875
Turn that off!

37:09.877 --> 37:11.828
This is not the time for this!

37:11.830 --> 37:14.021
Sorry, mom.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.159
How inappropriate!

37:15.161 --> 37:16.613
I'm sorry, it's off!

37:16.615 --> 37:17.858
I turned it off!

37:18.765 --> 37:22.073
Did you find that
black dress for tomorrow?

37:22.075 --> 37:24.218
Um, I'll look for it tonight, I promise.

37:28.235 --> 37:29.068
Mama?

37:30.285 --> 37:33.177
What do you know about the
family curse and the promise?

37:35.385 --> 37:37.233
I overheard Tatik talking to herself...

37:37.235 --> 37:38.333
You overheard nothing!

37:38.335 --> 37:40.643
Mom, please don't lie
to me, I'm not a child.

37:40.645 --> 37:42.893
I understand everything.

37:42.895 --> 37:45.813
You don't understand,
and you won't understand.

37:45.815 --> 37:48.363
Your grandmother went through
a lot when she was little.

37:48.365 --> 37:49.883
Those knuckle tattoos...

37:49.885 --> 37:50.718
I know.

37:59.815 --> 38:00.648
Well...

38:02.145 --> 38:04.695
There's no sense in keeping
it a secret any longer.

38:06.235 --> 38:07.953
She told me everything.

38:10.605 --> 38:12.355
She could no longer keep it inside.

38:15.525 --> 38:16.358
And your dad...

38:19.955 --> 38:21.705
She couldn't even tell her own son.

38:25.342 --> 38:28.453
But I guess confiding
in a stranger is easier.

38:28.455 --> 38:33.188
And, woman to woman, she
finally felt she could trust me.

38:35.015 --> 38:36.765
I though that day would never come.

38:39.625 --> 38:41.543
When she was eight years old,

38:41.545 --> 38:44.295
her pregnant mother took her
in the middle of the night

38:45.335 --> 38:47.788
to cross the river to
escape the Turkish guards.

38:50.865 --> 38:53.038
They arrested her father a day before.

38:54.745 --> 38:56.945
They told them it was
a suspicion of treason

38:58.023 --> 38:59.298
to the Turkish government.

39:01.625 --> 39:02.592
There was a boat.

39:04.851 --> 39:07.886
But there was no space left.

39:07.888 --> 39:10.548
And a kind man offered his to them.

39:11.695 --> 39:13.663
In exchange, he made them promise

39:13.665 --> 39:17.733
that they would deliver a
bundle of jewelry and valuables

39:17.735 --> 39:18.985
to his wife and children.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.478
They swore they would.

39:26.675 --> 39:30.408
Later, they found out that
the guards had beaten him,

39:31.735 --> 39:33.038
his arms and legs broken.

39:37.212 --> 39:39.565
And he died a slow death on the street.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.865
They never looked for the wife.

39:47.575 --> 39:50.573
And instead, they kept all that jewelry

39:50.575 --> 39:52.128
and used it to survive.

39:56.205 --> 39:58.278
I told you to turn that off!

39:59.175 --> 40:00.698
It's off, mom!

40:06.305 --> 40:07.997
No!

40:07.999 --> 40:09.938
You liar, how dare you?

40:12.355 --> 40:14.823
I love Armenian food.

40:14.825 --> 40:15.656
Thank you.

40:15.658 --> 40:17.183
No, thank you, Dr. Freedman.

40:17.185 --> 40:20.233
I really appreciate you taking
the time to speak with me.

40:20.235 --> 40:22.253
How did you find me again?

40:22.255 --> 40:24.238
A clairvoyant, Aida, recommended you.

40:26.455 --> 40:29.683
Your particular case is very intriguing.

40:29.685 --> 40:32.578
This kind of dormant
imprecation is very rare,

40:33.465 --> 40:37.123
but as you're experiencing
now, extremely potent.

40:37.125 --> 40:39.563
So according to what you've
told me over the phone,

40:39.565 --> 40:41.233
your two cousins and their mother

40:41.235 --> 40:43.623
have fallen victims within two weeks?

40:43.625 --> 40:44.803
Yes, Dr. Freedman.

40:44.805 --> 40:45.883
Sevan was first.

40:45.885 --> 40:48.943
Everyone thinks he
suffered a heart failure.

40:48.945 --> 40:50.958
But you saw something nobody else did.

40:52.145 --> 40:55.713
Your grandmother talking to
herself was a turning point.

40:55.715 --> 40:57.143
Yes.

40:57.145 --> 40:58.773
Now, we know that the curse was placed

40:58.775 --> 41:00.833
as a response to the
promise that was broken

41:00.835 --> 41:03.648
by your great-grandmother,
while she was pregnant.

41:05.185 --> 41:08.143
See, I believe that the state of gestation

41:08.145 --> 41:11.683
is a very powerful transitional state

41:11.685 --> 41:14.563
where any emotion aimed
at the expecting woman

41:14.565 --> 41:17.983
can become genetic, and
maintains its potency

41:17.985 --> 41:19.438
for hundreds of years.

41:22.085 --> 41:25.283
Therefore, affecting many generations.

41:25.285 --> 41:27.623
We have to find the source.

41:27.625 --> 41:28.456
The source?

41:28.458 --> 41:30.073
But-but he's dead.

41:30.075 --> 41:31.753
His body is.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.013
If your suspicions are correct,

41:34.015 --> 41:37.158
and all three victims died
at the hand of someone,

41:38.095 --> 41:41.903
something, then we need
to find the manifestation

41:41.905 --> 41:43.313
of that something.

41:43.315 --> 41:45.515
Something that
caused their deaths?

41:46.905 --> 41:48.403
Exactly.

41:48.405 --> 41:49.653
But I don't know what that is.

41:49.655 --> 41:51.755
Officially, Sevan died of a heart failure.

41:52.875 --> 41:54.785
Arsen was stabbed to death by...

41:56.525 --> 41:57.863
A suspected man.

41:57.865 --> 42:00.586
And their mother fell and broke her neck.

42:37.293 --> 42:40.626
Keep the promise...

42:48.732 --> 42:50.333
Keep the promise...

43:16.708 --> 43:18.291
Keep the promise...

44:26.465 --> 44:27.878
Who would be next in line?

44:31.575 --> 44:33.820
It's your family, isn't it?

44:56.235 --> 44:59.165
So, why did you bring me here?

44:59.167 --> 45:00.833
You know your mom can't stand me.

45:00.835 --> 45:01.666
What are you talking about?

45:01.668 --> 45:03.403
She adores you.

45:03.405 --> 45:04.533
Oh really?

45:04.535 --> 45:07.040
The last time that she
saw me, she was like,

45:07.042 --> 45:08.630
"Garo-jan!

45:08.632 --> 45:10.753
"Why are you like this?"

45:10.755 --> 45:12.143
You're the only who would understand

45:12.145 --> 45:13.388
what I'm about to say.

45:16.305 --> 45:17.275
Um...

45:19.445 --> 45:20.448
Is that on?

45:21.880 --> 45:23.115
Oh my God.

45:23.117 --> 45:25.517
Oh my God, oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God, yes!

45:28.845 --> 45:29.727
Hi!

45:33.520 --> 45:34.378
Hey, come on!

45:36.165 --> 45:36.996
Rude!

45:36.998 --> 45:37.829
There.

45:37.831 --> 45:41.537
Now it's off, now you can relax.

45:42.372 --> 45:43.553
Okay.

45:43.555 --> 45:45.121
So what is it?

45:45.123 --> 45:45.956
Okay.

45:47.852 --> 45:50.818
You know how you're into the supernatural?

45:52.475 --> 45:53.308
Okay?

45:56.725 --> 45:58.118
My family's cursed.

46:04.155 --> 46:06.528
See, I knew it would be a waste of time!

46:09.502 --> 46:11.883
Maro-jan, your family is cursed

46:11.885 --> 46:15.823
with what I call Armenicus-misogynisticus.

46:15.825 --> 46:17.388
Ugh, I'm serious!

46:17.390 --> 46:18.221
Mmhmm.

46:18.223 --> 46:20.053
Two of my cousins and their mother died

46:20.055 --> 46:21.853
within two weeks of each other.

46:21.855 --> 46:23.303
My grandma talked to herself about a,

46:23.305 --> 46:26.123
about a promise and a curse.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.053
After doing some research
and talking to people,

46:28.055 --> 46:31.773
I found out that my family
made a promise 100 years ago

46:31.775 --> 46:34.273
that wasn't kept, and-and now there's,

46:34.275 --> 46:36.263
there's something or someone set out

46:36.265 --> 46:38.573
to wipe out the whole family!

46:38.575 --> 46:42.373
My parents and I are next,
and grandma of course...

46:44.588 --> 46:45.908
Tatik, are you okay?

46:49.185 --> 46:51.243
I don't know what to do.

46:51.245 --> 46:54.473
Look, I'm really sorry, and
I wish I could help you but...

46:54.475 --> 46:56.198
Just tell me what you see.

46:57.685 --> 46:58.516
Please?

46:58.518 --> 46:59.441
No.

46:59.443 --> 47:00.274
- Help...
- Absolutely not.

47:00.276 --> 47:03.183
The last time that I
connected, I lost all my hair,

47:03.185 --> 47:05.043
and my nails chipped for a month!

47:05.045 --> 47:06.113
Please, I beg you!

47:06.115 --> 47:06.946
I...

47:06.948 --> 47:09.295
I don't know what to do,
I don't know where to go.

47:10.255 --> 47:12.128
Please help my family.

47:16.446 --> 47:19.942
Fine.

47:19.944 --> 47:20.777
Fine.

47:22.499 --> 47:23.940
Fine.

47:35.525 --> 47:38.014
Are those new glasses?

47:38.016 --> 47:38.849
Please.

48:21.985 --> 48:24.498
There is a man.

48:27.835 --> 48:28.958
An Armenian man.

48:36.775 --> 48:39.278
His heart is broken.

48:42.235 --> 48:43.465
His grief...

48:45.345 --> 48:46.538
Is endless.

48:51.645 --> 48:53.138
He wants a resolution.

48:56.528 --> 48:58.448
An acknowledgement.

48:59.416 --> 49:00.300
An acknowledgement of what?

49:00.302 --> 49:02.544
Shut up!

49:08.985 --> 49:10.318
He knows that...

49:12.866 --> 49:15.449
His wife and children suffered.

49:25.490 --> 49:29.225
But, he feels that

49:30.065 --> 49:32.528
that night on the river,

49:33.615 --> 49:37.157
he sacrificed his family

49:38.205 --> 49:39.095
for...

49:40.055 --> 49:42.098
Another family.

49:44.405 --> 49:46.752
A
family who didn't pay...

49:48.525 --> 49:50.046
Their dues.

49:51.445 --> 49:54.862
The
family who didn't manifest

49:54.864 --> 49:56.908
their gratefulness.

49:56.910 --> 49:59.493
A family who broke the promise.

50:04.227 --> 50:05.930
And now

50:05.932 --> 50:06.978
Now he wants to go.

50:08.015 --> 50:11.793
But before he goes...

50:11.795 --> 50:14.138
He must get his pay-off.

50:15.695 --> 50:19.868
He wants his family to have
the recognition they deserve.

50:21.015 --> 50:24.052
He must receive request for pardon.

50:52.127 --> 50:54.127
Can I have some water?

50:58.002 --> 51:00.286
Keep the promise...

51:00.288 --> 51:01.871
Keep the promise...

51:08.587 --> 51:09.420
Thank you.

51:26.442 --> 51:27.275
I'm tired.

51:30.023 --> 51:31.673
Let's go to Akbar!

51:31.675 --> 51:33.223
Wait, how-how do I
ask for his forgiveness?

51:33.225 --> 51:34.672
How-how do I find him?

51:38.025 --> 51:38.858
Look...

51:40.695 --> 51:44.583
Now that you know that you
have to ask for his forgiveness

51:44.585 --> 51:49.068
to save your family, try to make contact.

51:51.075 --> 51:51.908
But how?

51:55.145 --> 51:55.978
Okay.

51:58.215 --> 52:02.928
Before you go to sleep, stir
yourself in that direction.

52:05.515 --> 52:07.038
See what happens.

52:09.395 --> 52:10.548
And when you wake up,

52:11.385 --> 52:15.553
try to recall as many details as possible.

52:15.555 --> 52:20.208
Things like the place and
the time, stuff like that.

52:22.412 --> 52:23.245
But...

52:24.295 --> 52:26.008
Do not force it.

52:28.395 --> 52:29.462
Let it come to you.

52:34.622 --> 52:36.955
Now girl, let's get a drink.

53:25.142 --> 53:26.059
I'm home.

53:51.444 --> 53:52.694
Jesus, grandma!

53:53.639 --> 53:55.683
I didn't see you standing there.

53:56.518 --> 53:57.965
You scared the shit out of me.

53:59.813 --> 54:00.646
I'm sorry.

54:06.095 --> 54:09.253
I know it's not an easy
time for you, for any of us,

54:09.255 --> 54:10.858
but especially you.

54:13.721 --> 54:15.468
I know you're heartbroken.

54:15.470 --> 54:17.708
You've barely said a word
to me this whole week.

54:25.015 --> 54:27.783
Look, I understand what
you're going through.

54:27.785 --> 54:28.692
It's just...

54:31.079 --> 54:32.228
Just so sad.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.303
It hurts so much to know
what you experienced

54:37.305 --> 54:40.878
when you were a child, just a little girl.

54:45.105 --> 54:47.003
And I promise you, I'll tell your story.

54:47.005 --> 54:49.763
I'll-I'll never stop telling
your story until people listen,

54:49.765 --> 54:53.798
and everything that's been
happening to our family,

54:54.655 --> 54:56.468
I know that you're blaming yourself,

54:59.075 --> 55:02.593
but, I want you to know that
I don't think it's your fault

55:02.595 --> 55:05.273
and you have to stop tormenting yourself.

55:05.275 --> 55:08.018
You've lived through enough heartbreak.

55:14.455 --> 55:15.555
I know what you think.

55:16.466 --> 55:18.916
A spoiled brat, how could
I comprehend any of it?

55:20.061 --> 55:22.111
I'm too young and immature to see things.

55:24.775 --> 55:27.502
But I've been trying really hard and

55:27.504 --> 55:29.743
I know you think I'm spoon-fed

55:29.745 --> 55:31.283
and have all these privileges and freedom,

55:31.285 --> 55:34.635
but I understand you now,
more than ever, and...

55:40.405 --> 55:43.433
I think you're the most incredible woman

55:43.435 --> 55:46.035
for having lived through
the genocide and both wars.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.588
And you have the strength to carry on.

55:52.745 --> 55:54.688
I need you back in my life so bad...

56:00.285 --> 56:01.715
Please, grandma...

56:10.675 --> 56:11.508
Mom?

56:13.105 --> 56:14.838
Something's wrong with Tatik!

56:16.891 --> 56:17.724
Mom!

56:22.448 --> 56:23.281
Tatik?

56:38.735 --> 56:39.588
This is it.

56:41.945 --> 56:43.178
Grandma's given up.

56:44.705 --> 56:47.455
And if she gave up, then what
else is there to be done?

56:51.055 --> 56:51.888
I...

56:53.545 --> 56:56.318
I couldn't figure this
out, I failed my family.

57:02.235 --> 57:03.728
She might be leaving us soon.

57:06.375 --> 57:07.475
And that thing...

57:08.325 --> 57:09.555
That man...

57:10.505 --> 57:13.813
I am not scared of him.

57:13.815 --> 57:14.953
I want him to show himself.

57:14.955 --> 57:16.232
I want to confront him.

57:19.353 --> 57:20.838
So what are you waiting for?

57:22.735 --> 57:24.878
Come out and confront me, I'm waiting!

57:25.965 --> 57:28.838
Come and take it all, I-I dare you!

57:35.768 --> 57:36.601
Mom!

58:22.885 --> 58:24.525
Grandma is gone.

58:25.475 --> 58:28.025
The curse is in motion and
seems to be unstoppable.

58:30.465 --> 58:31.478
I am lost.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.923
She didn't particularly like coming here.

58:35.925 --> 58:37.743
It reminded her of a lifelong betrayal

58:37.745 --> 58:39.838
she and millions like her suffered.

58:48.530 --> 58:50.973
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

58:50.975 --> 58:53.885
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

59:02.390 --> 59:04.723
How could
I ever understand her pain?

59:04.725 --> 59:06.558
The loss, the betrayal?

59:14.318 --> 59:19.151
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

59:26.585 --> 59:27.883
My family
has carried this curse

59:27.885 --> 59:29.258
for 100 years.

59:30.995 --> 59:33.053
I will keep the promise
I made to my grandma,

59:33.055 --> 59:36.568
the promise to never stop,
now matter how bad it gets.

59:46.345 --> 59:48.593
I am following Garo's
and Dr. Freedman's advice

59:48.595 --> 59:50.638
and I am trying to establish contact.

59:51.705 --> 59:53.038
I think I'm getting close.

59:55.635 --> 59:57.810
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

59:57.812 --> 01:00:00.895
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:13.439
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.800
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:00:30.648 --> 01:00:33.731
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:00:41.006 --> 01:00:44.089
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.813
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:25.593
Keep the promise, promise, promise...

01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:08.422
Dr.Freedman talked about

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.826
the power of grief.

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:13.633
Garo said that sleeping is
like swimming in the river

01:02:13.635 --> 01:02:17.508
between two worlds,
reality and subconscious.

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.453
Grandma's deepest pain had always been

01:02:20.455 --> 01:02:22.438
her childhood memory of Turkey.

01:02:23.895 --> 01:02:25.668
I have all the puzzle pieces now.

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:52.448
People everywhere.

01:02:53.885 --> 01:02:55.363
Crowds.

01:02:55.365 --> 01:02:56.833
Women.

01:02:56.835 --> 01:02:57.768
Children.

01:02:59.135 --> 01:03:01.018
It's hot, there is no water.

01:03:02.235 --> 01:03:04.303
Everyone is disoriented.

01:03:04.305 --> 01:03:06.928
They feel like they're
walking in a giant circle.

01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:11.743
No one had any food for days.

01:03:11.745 --> 01:03:13.098
They began to hallucinate.

01:03:14.805 --> 01:03:17.308
The guards are circling
around on their horses.

01:03:19.085 --> 01:03:21.803
They were told they are
being taken to a safe place,

01:03:21.805 --> 01:03:23.238
away from war.

01:03:24.715 --> 01:03:27.348
Taken out of their homes,
with not much to carry.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:30.883
Girls are taken away into slavery.

01:03:30.885 --> 01:03:33.798
Children orphaned by hunger and illness.

01:03:34.955 --> 01:03:38.798
They run in gangs, begging
for food, stealing.

01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:41.838
Many die untreated.

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:46.128
Bodies everywhere.

01:03:47.015 --> 01:03:48.983
Broken legs.

01:03:48.985 --> 01:03:49.895
Broken arms.

01:03:55.704 --> 01:03:57.121
Broken spirits...

01:04:32.027 --> 01:04:35.527
This is not happening, this is not real...

01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:45.228
Keep the
promise, promise, promise...

01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:52.993
I'm not scared of you!

01:04:52.995 --> 01:04:53.828
Show yourself!

01:04:57.105 --> 01:05:00.086
