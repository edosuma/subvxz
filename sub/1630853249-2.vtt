00:08.834 --> 00:10.227
Hamlin: Where did it
come from?

00:10.271 --> 00:11.315
Didn't it just fall
out of your locker?

00:11.359 --> 00:13.491
I don't see how...

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
Lalo Salamanca
is dead.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.538
Ignacio Varga is a rat.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.409
Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.

00:18.453 --> 00:21.108
The kid deserves
your respect.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.413
He has it.

00:22.457 --> 00:25.155
Lalo:

00:27.940 --> 00:29.290
Tyrus: <i>We're working on</i> <i>
getting you out.</i>

00:29.333 --> 00:30.639
<i>It's gonna take</i> <i>
a couple of days.</i>

00:30.682 --> 00:31.944
What happens
between now and then?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.859
<i>Stay out of sight.</i>

00:37.167 --> 00:41.302
Ricki Lake: <i>Why'd you
break up with him to begin
with? What happened?</i>

00:41.345 --> 00:43.565
Woman: <i>Okay, well, first I got</i> <i>
to start off with how we met. Okay.</i>

00:43.608 --> 00:45.523
<i>I met him in August of 2002</i> <i>
on BlackPlanet. A beautiful, sunny day.</i>

00:45.567 --> 00:48.613
It was! <i>You saw him
from across the horizon.</i>

00:48.657 --> 00:51.312
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:51.355 --> 00:53.531
<i>And I'm like, "Okay,</i> <i>
I got to make sure</i>

00:53.575 --> 00:55.533
<i>this is</i> <i>
all the way safe."</i>

00:55.577 --> 00:57.100
<i>So I wait from August to April</i> <i>
to go see him in person, so --</i>

00:57.144 --> 00:59.015
<i>Okay.
You met on the Internet. Yeah.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:01.191
<i>Okay.</i> <i>
So, I take myself,</i> <i>
23-hour bus tri--</i>

01:01.235 --> 01:02.453
<i>bus trip from...</i>

01:02.497 --> 01:04.934
Ah!

01:06.022 --> 01:07.458
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.938
<i>I was like,</i> <i>
with everything...</i>

01:08.981 --> 01:10.983
<i>You bathed him.</i>

01:11.027 --> 01:12.246
<i>Everything...</i> I think I'm --
I think I'm getting really --

01:12.289 --> 01:13.682
really good at this.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.118
But wh-wh-what do you --
what do you think the --

01:15.162 --> 01:16.337
what the record is? <i>Love him!</i>

01:16.380 --> 01:17.686
<i>I stayed up...</i>

01:17.729 --> 01:19.079
I-It's got to be like a l--
like a lot,

01:19.122 --> 01:20.297
but wh-what
- do you think it is?
- Yeah.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.733
Wh-What do you think
the record is?

01:21.777 --> 01:22.952
<i>...get the paper,</i> <i>
everything...</i>

01:22.995 --> 01:24.345
- The record?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.694
I-I don't --
I don't know.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.391
<i>The girlfriend</i> <i>
of the century.</i>

01:27.435 --> 01:29.741
Like -- Like -- L--
Hundreds. Hundreds. Hundreds.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.178
At least hundreds.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.876
Like, I-I would --
I would need more dominoes.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.747
I -- You know,
I just -- I just think

01:35.791 --> 01:38.054
I can get
really good at this.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.969
You know,
and, like, you just --

01:40.012 --> 01:41.971
you just -- you have --
you have to set it up

01:42.014 --> 01:44.495
and then -- you just --
you have to set it up,

01:44.539 --> 01:45.757
and the people come --

01:45.801 --> 01:47.150
they come up
and they count them.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.673
That's just how that --
That's how it works.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.153
But if you knock it over
before they come over here,

01:50.197 --> 01:52.024
it doesn't count anymore.
It doesn't count. Right?

01:52.068 --> 01:53.069
If I just set it up
correctly and then they
would set the whole...

01:55.158 --> 01:56.594
...come over, and then
they would come in --
and so, then, you know, but --

01:56.638 --> 01:58.335
<i>...kind of like</i> <i>
over the phone...</i>

01:58.379 --> 01:59.989
- Nacho's not here.
- If I knock it over before they...

02:00.032 --> 02:01.512
We haven't heard
anything from him....it doesn't --

02:01.556 --> 02:03.384
Jo: Ahh!
Oh, my God!

02:03.427 --> 02:04.994
We don't know where he is.
He's been gone a long time.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.388
Please don't -- We --
We haven't heard anything.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.433
We don't
- know anything.
- Please, please, please, please.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.348
Ladies.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.263
Please, please, please,
please, please, please...

02:13.307 --> 02:15.396
Ladies.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.875
Pay attention....please,
please, please --

02:18.225 --> 02:19.661
<i>...considering I got</i> <i>
a lot of --</i>

02:19.704 --> 02:21.184
<i>I got demand and...</i>

02:21.228 --> 02:23.795
I have a message
from Nacho. <i>Exactly.</i>

02:23.839 --> 02:27.364
He won't be coming back.
He sends his regrets.

02:27.408 --> 02:31.760
So...here's what's
going to happen.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.892
You're going to take
what's yours,

02:33.936 --> 02:35.546
and you're
going to leave.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.026
Jo: But we --

02:37.069 --> 02:38.897
You -- You -- You --
You want us to leave?

02:38.941 --> 02:41.204
Amber: Wait. That --
That man -- where is he going?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.858
He's helping you
gather your things.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.034
But...

02:45.077 --> 02:47.645
But we like it here.

02:47.689 --> 02:51.345
Well, now you're going to
like it someplace else.

02:51.388 --> 02:55.000
You're going to
take this.

02:55.044 --> 02:58.047
Get on a bus.
Go to your families.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.440
You don't have
a family,

02:59.483 --> 03:01.964
then you go
to a friend.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.227
You don't have friends...

03:04.271 --> 03:05.794
then make some.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.666
But I strongly suggest
you do whatever you can

03:08.710 --> 03:11.669
to get back
on your feet.

03:11.713 --> 03:15.064
But do it
far away from here.

03:21.026 --> 03:24.552
This goes back in my pocket
in five seconds.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.556
You won't like
what happens next.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.177
You never come back.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.760
Two-and-a-half deep.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.764
Two-and-a-half wide.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.116
Three-and-a-half high.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.076
Tuthill,
dial lock on the left.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.382
Yeah. Yeah.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.526
I was a hard worker.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.573
I was a company man.

08:08.009 --> 08:11.447
20 years
and I didn't miss a single day.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.974
They even gave me
a plaque for it.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.543
It was a gold plaque.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.198
Perfect attendance.

08:25.156 --> 08:29.770
But when they handed it to me,
I wrenched my back.

08:29.813 --> 08:33.904
I was in so much pain,
I couldn't do my job,

08:33.948 --> 08:38.779
which meant I couldn't
put food on the table.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.650
I didn't want to sue,

08:40.694 --> 08:45.089
but with a family to support,
what choice did I have?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.049
Wait. Who are you
supposed to be again?

08:48.092 --> 08:49.398
Whatever.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.574
I -- The backstory
is just a placeholder.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.142
I'm gonna polish the script
once we cast.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.013
But a
personal injury suit?

08:56.057 --> 08:57.319
Best case scenario,

08:57.362 --> 08:59.364
that gets them in
with an associate...

09:00.627 --> 09:02.324
Mesothelioma.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.022
When I took
that job at the shoe factory,

09:05.066 --> 09:06.763
I had no idea
I was risking my life.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.373
Now I can't
stop coughing.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.028
Right? Come on.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.596
Hey, a mesothelioma
class action

09:13.640 --> 09:15.598
built Clifford Main
his vacation house.

09:15.642 --> 09:19.036
He hears "mesothelioma,"
his eyes pop!

09:19.080 --> 09:21.604
Well, sure,
but then he takes the case.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.693
What happens when he asks for
a medical evaluation, right?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.740
And how
does Howard come up?

09:26.783 --> 09:29.046
Okay.
Ask me why I'm here.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.831
What brings you
to Davis & Main today?

09:30.874 --> 09:33.268
I am sick.
I'm really sick. Good.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.836
It's not mesothelioma,
but it's not good,

09:35.879 --> 09:37.141
and I need a lawyer.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.447
And the pickings
are slim.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.231
I already went
to HHM.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.581
I met
with their top guy.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.845
Howard Hamlin.
And, uh, uh...

09:44.888 --> 09:46.150
I've got
a brother-in-law,

09:46.194 --> 09:47.891
and he's got
a pretty nasty coke habit,

09:47.935 --> 09:49.153
very similar energy.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.502
Just put me off. Oh.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.243
Anyway, I need a lawyer,
blah, blah, blah.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.810
Okay,
but you got a bad feeling

09:53.854 --> 09:55.333
from just one meeting?

09:55.377 --> 09:57.074
Yeah, well, the brother-in-law
with the coke.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.860
Yeah, but you were only
- in the room with him once.
- Okay.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.644
So it's got to be someone
with a history with Howard.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.081
Yeah.
But Cliff has to want
to take the meeting,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.648
but not the case. Right.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.868
It's gotta be good,
but not too good.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.261
Exactly.
There's a sweet spot.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.872
You know,
like a magnet.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.657
We -- We pull Cliff in,
and then repel him...

10:14.701 --> 10:17.138
Hmm.

10:23.535 --> 10:26.147
Oh.
What?

10:29.498 --> 10:32.762
You are
going to hate this.

10:56.525 --> 10:57.918
Incident report.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.310
Autopsy report.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.791
Site map.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.712
It all checks out.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.019
Dental records, too.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.377
This is everything?

11:22.420 --> 11:25.032
Everything
the Federales have.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.303
How did
the fire start?

11:35.346 --> 11:37.348
It began
at the kitchen stove.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.960
They think, uh,
someone was cooking

11:40.003 --> 11:42.397
when it all
went down.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.807
Don Juan.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.504
I have had
another thought

12:02.547 --> 12:05.072
about how we might
keep the peace...

12:22.306 --> 12:25.092
Wow.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.746
Okeydokey.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.752
Just take
these little bits off for you.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.450
We recycle,
so you can feel good about that.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.758
Alrighty.

13:22.802 --> 13:28.155
That's $246.73
for you!

13:28.198 --> 13:32.681
But first, we need
a few little signatures...

13:32.724 --> 13:34.335
Just here...

13:38.818 --> 13:40.384
Good.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.910
Be right with --

13:48.131 --> 13:52.570
Um, and one more
right here.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.315
And that's all
there is to it.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.101
Here you go.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.320
They'll cash this
over at the casino for me?

14:03.364 --> 14:05.322
They sure will.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.890
- Thank you.
- Thank you for choosing Sweet Liberty Tax Services.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.500
Okay.
- Thank you.
- Tell your friends!

14:09.544 --> 14:10.893
- I sure will.
- Mm-hmm.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.199
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.331
Mm.
Hello, Betsy.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.333
Long time no see.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.682
Get out.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.120
I have something
very exciting

14:20.163 --> 14:21.904
I want to discuss with you
and your husband.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.340
We are not interested.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.125
I am
asking you nicely

14:25.168 --> 14:27.388
to leave
our place of business.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.693
This, you're gonna
want to hear.

14:28.737 --> 14:29.956
If you don't leave
right now,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.479
my husband
is going to remove you

14:31.522 --> 14:32.959
from this establishment.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.743
Bodily.

14:34.786 --> 14:38.225
A golden opportunity like this
only comes --
Craig?

14:39.313 --> 14:41.924
Mr. Kettleman,
may I see you up front?

14:41.968 --> 14:43.534
Mr. McGill!

14:43.578 --> 14:44.709
Hey.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.712
Oh!
Good to see you.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.323
It's Goodman now, actually.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.064
Saul Goodman.
- Long story.
- Okay.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.935
But, hey,
you're looking fit.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.589
I see, uh,
- County didn't do you any harm.
- Oh.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.375
Y'know, they have a surprisingly
good exercise program, yeah.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.377
It's aerobics mostly,
or do they --Um --

15:00.421 --> 15:03.032
Craig. Honey.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.209
Maybe we should discuss this
in private?

15:06.253 --> 15:07.558
Oh.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.951
Excuse us
for a second.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.518
We have a little
tax emergency --

15:10.561 --> 15:11.867
Craig!
Yep.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.260
Okay.
Go.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.565
Okay, just --

15:14.609 --> 15:16.263
Just get away
from here.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.918
You've got some nerve
coming here after what you did.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.267
Listen --
Thief!

15:21.616 --> 15:24.575
Because of you,
we lost everything.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.882
Our kids
are in public school.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.189
So why don't you
go crawl back

15:29.232 --> 15:31.669
under whatever
slime-covered rock you came from

15:31.713 --> 15:33.584
and leave us
the heck alone!

15:33.628 --> 15:36.239
Okay. I -- I sense
some anger here.

15:36.283 --> 15:39.329
But, uh, that's -- that's
perfectly understandable.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.331
But since
you brought it up...

15:41.375 --> 15:43.812
I came here today
because I was curious

15:43.855 --> 15:45.814
if you two
wanted your lives back.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.337
There's actually
a legal term for it.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.860
"Exoneration."

15:48.904 --> 15:51.733
Oh, y'know, we actually did
look into that.

15:51.776 --> 15:52.995
Yep.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.823
We went to a number
of lawyers and --

15:54.866 --> 15:56.216
Real lawyers.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.305
Yes.
They were all terrific.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.002
But they said
that it was impossible.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.612
Mm-hmm.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.789
Okay, but those lawyers
don't know what I know.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.269
- What's that?
- No, Craig.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.793
- He's got an angle.
- I do have an angle, Craig.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.491
It's an angle
called justice.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.015
Uh, let me
put it this way.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
I think
that within Craig's case,

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
I have found the grounds
for a civil suit.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.326
A big one.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.330
Big.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.948
Okay, then.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.689
Let's hear it.

16:34.732 --> 16:35.951
Let's hold your horses

16:35.995 --> 16:37.518
because we've been
down this road before,

16:37.561 --> 16:39.085
and the last time
I gave you two advice,

16:39.128 --> 16:40.869
you went straight
to the competition with it.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.653
So I just need
some assurances

16:42.697 --> 16:44.612
that all my hard work
isn't gonna end up

16:44.655 --> 16:46.614
in the hands of, uh,
Clifford Main

16:46.657 --> 16:48.224
or some other asshole

16:48.268 --> 16:50.487
at some pretentious
Santa Fe white shoe law firm.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.968
So, before we
talk turkey...

16:53.012 --> 16:54.796
Letters of Engagement.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.493
Yeah.
Yeah,
you remember these.

16:56.537 --> 16:57.842
I made some updates.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.236
Just closed a few loopholes
and whatnot.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.370
So, uh --
We're not
signing anything.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.894
You're gonna
have to sign

17:05.937 --> 17:07.156
if you want to know
what I know, so...

17:07.200 --> 17:09.985
We're not signing.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.336
Really?
You're sure?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.251
Yep.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.732
Craig?

17:19.516 --> 17:21.170
Thanks anyway.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.180
Alright, well, um...

17:32.921 --> 17:34.923
Sorry we couldn't
work something out.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.404
I'm sure you are.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.886
What?
Are you crazy?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.932
He has something
that could exonerate me.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.542
No, he doesn't.
He is a crook.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.153
He is
a crookedy crook.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.117
Mr. Goodman?

18:00.601 --> 18:03.038
Best decision
you've ever made.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.221
Here you go. Oh.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.271
So.
What do you know?

18:18.314 --> 18:20.447
You got one, too, Betsy.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.804
Oh, come on.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.633
That's not --
Ow.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.376
Alright, well, we are
officially in business.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.378
I have it on good authority

18:38.421 --> 18:40.771
that Craig here was not
given proper counsel.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.121
We already knew that.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.166
But did you
ask yourselves why?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.386
No. Why?

18:46.429 --> 18:49.432
What if I told you
that in your hour of need,

18:49.476 --> 18:53.393
the person who was supposed to
be on your side was impaired.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.482
Impaired?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.180
A --

18:58.224 --> 19:00.574
A "person of substance."

19:00.617 --> 19:03.533
Substance?

19:03.577 --> 19:06.014
A person
of substance... The substance
in question

19:06.057 --> 19:09.148
being a certain
illegal white powder.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.020
That awful woman
with the ponytail

19:12.063 --> 19:13.282
is a cocaine addict?

19:13.326 --> 19:14.762
No, not Kim Wexler. No.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.067
Craig's lead attorney.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.852
Howard Hamlin.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.028
Oh.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.422
But he was
so professional

19:22.465 --> 19:24.424
and --
and...energetic.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.729
Upbeat.

19:25.773 --> 19:26.991
Oooooh.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.776
"Ooooh" is right.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.213
So upbeat
is bad...?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.781
In this case,
it's textbook malpractice.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.652
I believe
the magic phrase

19:35.696 --> 19:38.220
is "ineffective
assistance of counsel."

19:38.264 --> 19:41.441
If your guy wasn't nose deep
in the devil's dandruff,

19:41.484 --> 19:44.487
well, Craig's case would have
turned out completely different.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.837
Oh, my God.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.884
Don't we need
some kind of proof?

19:49.927 --> 19:52.234
All the dirty laundry
comes out in discovery.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.062
Mm.
Just the trips
to rehab...

19:54.105 --> 19:56.064
Mm-hmm....secret drug deals.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.848
All we got to do
is get the ball rolling.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.721
So I say we get started
on your affidavits.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.853
- Yes. Yes.
- About that...

20:02.897 --> 20:05.073
We happen
to know a thing or two

20:05.116 --> 20:06.466
about our rights,
Mr. McGill.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.338
And it doesn't matter
what you force us to sign.

20:09.382 --> 20:13.168
We don't have to work with
any lawyer we don't want.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.475
And that means
you're fired.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.737
I am not fired!

20:16.780 --> 20:17.999
Betsy:
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No. No!

20:18.042 --> 20:19.218
He's fired?
I thought --

20:19.261 --> 20:20.697
Craig.
Craig.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.222
I thought we were so... No, you can't fire me.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.093
I found this case.
It's mine.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.790
Hey -- Hey, you want
to hear about rights?

20:26.834 --> 20:29.271
The second you say where
you got this information from,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.099
guess who automatically
gets a cut?

20:31.142 --> 20:32.883
Me.
So go ahead!

20:32.927 --> 20:35.277
Go ahead
and see what happens!

20:35.321 --> 20:36.496
Yah!

24:24.375 --> 24:26.769
Hey,
do you have a sec?

24:26.813 --> 24:29.337
Of course.
What's up?

24:29.380 --> 24:30.773
I've got a prospective client
in my office

24:30.817 --> 24:32.079
and I wanted
to check with you

24:32.122 --> 24:33.820
before I officially
turn him away.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.256
Who is it?

24:35.299 --> 24:36.692
Remember the old
Bernalillo County treasurer?

24:36.736 --> 24:38.302
The one
who embezzled...

24:38.346 --> 24:40.391
I think it was something like
two million dollars?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.306
Kettlebell?
Kettleman.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.091
Craig Kettleman. Yes.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.354
Now Mr. Kettleman's here
with his wife

24:46.397 --> 24:48.530
because they want to sue
his former lawyers.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.838
They're saying
he didn't have proper counsel.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.623
Didn't HHM
handle that case?

24:54.667 --> 24:56.320
We didn't get into
the details.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.148
They said they wanted
to talk to someone in charge

24:58.192 --> 25:01.630
and I'm just a, quote,
"pre-pubescent intern."

25:02.718 --> 25:04.894
What's the basis
of their claim?

25:04.938 --> 25:07.462
Cocaine.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.770
Howard Hamlin?

25:10.813 --> 25:12.728
Oh, you don't see it
right away.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.469
He is
very high functioning.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.689
He is living a life
outside his life...
Mm-hmm.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.386
Yes, he is.
...as they
sometimes say.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.648
Yep.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.998
And -- And what leads you
to believe this?

25:22.042 --> 25:23.609
Well,
we heard that --

25:23.652 --> 25:25.567
I heard...
You -- Yeah.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.788
...certain things
- during my incarceration.
- Yeah.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.790
I mean, it was pretty much
common knowledge

25:30.833 --> 25:32.400
- out in the yard.
- Out in the yard. Yeah.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.445
Common knowledge.
- Out in the yard.
- Yes.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.013
Yeah. Those drug people can
spot each other a mile away.

25:37.057 --> 25:39.755
- They just know.
- Yeah.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.584
Did you have any evidence
to support this?

25:42.628 --> 25:47.371
Well, it will all come out
- in discovery.
- Discovery.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.373
All his
drug purchases,

25:49.417 --> 25:51.811
his drug associates,
mm-hmm...

25:51.854 --> 25:54.596
All of that gets on the record
during discovery.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.815
Discovery.
Yeah.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.120
Okay.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.644
But, uh,
you're the expert here.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.778
We are prepared
to give our affidavits anytime.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.999
Today would even be
perfectly convenient for us.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.175
Yes, we are ready
when you are.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.177
Yes.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.831
Well,
I want to thank you

26:11.874 --> 26:13.920
for taking the time
to come see us.

26:13.963 --> 26:17.010
Unfortunately, I don't think
we're gonna be able to help.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.839
Our firm is partnering with HHM
on another case,

26:19.882 --> 26:22.842
so this would be
a clear conflict of interest.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.757
Partnering with them?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.629
Well,
surely that will change

26:27.673 --> 26:29.805
now that
you know the facts.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.067
With the...

26:31.111 --> 26:33.200
Can I give you
some advice?

26:33.243 --> 26:35.071
You're gonna have
a difficult time pursuing this

26:35.115 --> 26:36.856
no matter
who your lawyer is.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.510
Overturning a conviction
in a case like Craig's

26:39.554 --> 26:40.947
is extremely difficult.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.471
Even if these allegations
were true --

26:43.514 --> 26:44.994
and I got
to tell ya,

26:45.038 --> 26:47.649
it does not sound like
the Howard Hamlin that I know --

26:47.693 --> 26:49.956
it is unlikely
that you will succeed.

26:51.566 --> 26:54.656
So you won't
represent Craig?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.137
Main:
I'm afraid not.

27:00.488 --> 27:03.665
Well, then we will take
our business elsewhere.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.102
Sorry we couldn't
- be of help.
- Bet you are.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.582
Uh...okay.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.890
Woman: Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.066
She's been expecting you
to call. One moment.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.676
Man: We're gonna start
with the...

27:14.720 --> 27:16.112
Man #2: Hi, Mr. Robertson. Sorry.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.374
Wow.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.854
Yeah...

27:18.898 --> 27:20.682
I know
I don't need to remind you

27:20.726 --> 27:22.162
everything we just heard
was privileged.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.511
Of course.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.687
And Howard Hamlin?
Please.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.081
I tried
to save you the time.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.343
You did, Erin.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.084
Thank you.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.580
Don Hector.

30:27.086 --> 30:29.566
Bolsa:
We'll be in touch.

30:50.544 --> 30:53.329
Mike: <i>

38:16.816 --> 38:19.471

No.

39:29.628 --> 39:30.803
I got --
I got a bad feeling.

Now.

44:49.251 --> 44:52.167
Okay.
Look at this.

44:52.211 --> 44:54.561
I got Judge Papadoumian
tomorrow at 11:00

44:54.604 --> 44:57.695
and I want her
to see stars in her eyes.

44:57.738 --> 44:59.871
I don't know
about stars.

44:59.914 --> 45:01.568
You might blind her.

45:01.611 --> 45:02.961
No offense.

45:03.004 --> 45:05.137
You don't know her
like I do.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.660
Stars.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.931
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

45:16.975 --> 45:19.586
Ho, wait.
Okay. Alright.

45:19.629 --> 45:22.502
Just take a breath,
and then we can --

45:22.545 --> 45:25.374
Okay, okay,
I can tell you're upset.

45:25.418 --> 45:28.769
Just, uh -- I --
I never advised that.

45:28.813 --> 45:30.205
No.

45:30.249 --> 45:33.687
No, I did not,
so let's agree to disagree.

45:35.036 --> 45:36.559
Okay,
I think you're gonna want

45:36.603 --> 45:38.692
to meet in person
before you do anything rash.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.476
So, how about --
how about we meet up

45:40.520 --> 45:41.869
and we can
hash this out?

45:43.218 --> 45:45.612
Sure, sure. Tomorrow.
First thing. Uh, 9 a.m.

45:45.655 --> 45:47.005
Uh, I can come
to your office.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.397
That work?

45:48.441 --> 45:50.791
Okay. Okay. Good.

45:54.142 --> 45:56.797
I'm surprised
it took 'em this long.

45:58.364 --> 45:59.887
Alright.

46:03.717 --> 46:07.634
You, uh... you're gonna use
the stick, right?

46:07.677 --> 46:09.636
The stick?

46:09.679 --> 46:11.420
Yeah, well,
it's a big stick.

46:11.464 --> 46:14.249
It's huge.
But I know these people.

46:14.293 --> 46:16.425
They're more
carrot types.

46:16.469 --> 46:19.124
Especially her.

46:24.390 --> 46:28.481
A spoonful of sugar,
y'know?

46:43.322 --> 46:45.933
I think
maybe I'll come, too.

46:47.108 --> 46:49.502
Tomorrow? Really?

46:49.545 --> 46:52.461
Sure.
I have time.

46:56.509 --> 46:59.338
Okay.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.090
Anything?

47:14.657 --> 47:17.182
All quiet.

47:18.574 --> 47:19.924
<i>Stay sharp.</i>

47:24.798 --> 47:27.148
Tyrus: They found the truck,
but no sign of Varga.

47:27.192 --> 47:28.889
Salamancas have all hands
looking for him,

47:28.933 --> 47:30.108
including
the Federales.

47:30.151 --> 47:31.500
He's still not
picking up his cell,

47:31.544 --> 47:33.372
so no way
to get a lock on it.

47:33.415 --> 47:35.113
Now, as for Lalo,
still missing.

47:35.156 --> 47:37.115
Far as everybody
in the cartel is concerned,

47:37.158 --> 47:38.986
top to bottom,
Lalo is dead.

47:40.379 --> 47:42.816
Mike: Oh.
May I offer a thought?

47:46.776 --> 47:50.041
If Salamanca
were coming straight for you,

47:50.084 --> 47:51.738
he'd be here already.

47:51.781 --> 47:53.566
We've got
guys watching

47:53.609 --> 47:57.091
anywhere he might turn up
this side of Mexico,

47:57.135 --> 47:59.964
wiretaps on any phone
he might call.

48:00.007 --> 48:02.401
There is not
a whiff of him.

48:02.444 --> 48:06.100
Now, my guess is
he's smart enough to know

48:06.144 --> 48:08.537
it's not in
the Salamanca family interests

48:08.581 --> 48:10.757
to take you out
without a reason

48:10.800 --> 48:12.628
the bosses
can get behind.

48:12.672 --> 48:15.544
So the odds are,
he's searching for Varga.

48:15.588 --> 48:18.852
Finds him alive,
gets him to talk...

48:20.985 --> 48:23.248
Varga's alone
in foreign territory.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.989
No one he can trust.

48:25.032 --> 48:28.557
The kid's smart,
but he's not gonna last.

48:28.601 --> 48:31.604
He's gonna get caught.

48:48.229 --> 48:49.578
Continue.

48:49.622 --> 48:51.711
The best way
to handle this...

48:51.754 --> 48:53.800
I take
four of our best guys

48:53.843 --> 48:56.716
across the border
and track Varga down.

48:56.759 --> 48:58.109
Let me find him,

48:58.152 --> 49:01.634
bring him back before
the Salamancas sweep him up.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.203
It's our only play.

49:38.366 --> 49:40.194
No.

49:40.238 --> 49:42.544
You're not doing that.

50:03.696 --> 50:06.046
You don't understand.

50:06.090 --> 50:08.570
That's not happening.

50:13.706 --> 50:16.013
Just say the word.

50:18.058 --> 50:19.625
Whatever happens next,

50:19.668 --> 50:23.020
it's not gonna go down
the way you think it is.

50:44.563 --> 50:45.825
It's him.

50:45.868 --> 50:47.087
Bullshit.

50:47.131 --> 50:48.349
I've been calling Varga
for hours.

50:48.393 --> 50:50.264
He hasn't
picked up once.

50:50.308 --> 50:53.267
He's been trying to get me
since he left Salamanca's.

50:55.356 --> 50:57.184
You want me
to answer it?

51:06.976 --> 51:09.544
Yeah.

51:11.329 --> 51:12.765
Yeah.

51:14.288 --> 51:16.943
Not my call.

51:20.773 --> 51:23.123
That's up to you.

51:26.996 --> 51:29.390
He wants
to talk to you.

51:51.412 --> 51:53.284
How the mighty
have fallen, huh?

51:54.807 --> 51:57.636
Lady Liberty's
a nice touch, though.

52:01.205 --> 52:03.946
Sure you wanna
go in?

52:03.990 --> 52:05.339
Yeah.

52:05.383 --> 52:08.125
Let's do this.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.486
Hello, folks.
Top of the morning.

52:21.529 --> 52:23.183
In the flesh,
as promised.

52:23.227 --> 52:24.793
What is
she doing here?

52:24.837 --> 52:26.186
Anything you want
to say to me,

52:26.230 --> 52:28.145
you can say
in front of Ms. Wexler.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.363
Kim:
We're married.

52:29.407 --> 52:32.410
Oh!
Mazel Tov. Fine.

52:32.453 --> 52:33.976
I'll talk
in front of her.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.630
I'll talk
in front of anybody.

52:35.674 --> 52:37.850
Everyone's gonna hear the truth
soon enough, anyway.

52:37.893 --> 52:39.591
And what truth
is that?

52:39.634 --> 52:42.420
There is no case.
There never was a case.

52:42.463 --> 52:44.335
We went to
four different lawyers --

52:44.378 --> 52:46.598
real,
legitimate lawyers --

52:46.641 --> 52:48.817
and they all said
the same thing.

52:48.861 --> 52:51.298
There is not
a snowball's chance in Hell

52:51.342 --> 52:54.083
there was ever money
or anything else for us

52:54.127 --> 52:57.348
in this "insufficiency
of counsel" nonsense.

52:57.391 --> 53:01.003
I didn't get it at first --
why would you do this?

53:01.047 --> 53:03.005
Why send us
down this road?

53:03.049 --> 53:06.270
Then the clouds parted
on your sick little scheme.

53:06.313 --> 53:08.228
You used us.

53:08.272 --> 53:10.839
Us
and our good name

53:10.883 --> 53:13.973
to character assassinate
Howard Hamlin.

53:14.016 --> 53:15.453
Somehow, some way,

53:15.496 --> 53:17.455
it benefits you
to tear him down.

53:17.498 --> 53:20.893
Yeah.
And we're...we're mad.

53:20.936 --> 53:25.071
Okay, yeah... I'm hearing
a lot of unfounded accusations

53:25.114 --> 53:26.333
being tossed around.

53:26.377 --> 53:28.857
I don't know anything
about "schemes"

53:28.901 --> 53:31.860
or "character assassination"
or whatnot.

53:31.904 --> 53:35.255
But
if you're feeling slighted,

53:35.299 --> 53:37.301
um, we can
make it right.

53:37.344 --> 53:38.693
Money?

53:40.304 --> 53:43.045
Money's not gonna
take care of this.

53:43.089 --> 53:44.786
Money takes care
of everything.

53:44.830 --> 53:46.266
I --
Isn't that the motto

53:46.310 --> 53:48.399
stitched into
the Kettleman Family Crest?

53:48.442 --> 53:50.705
We don't want money.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.577
I am nonplussed.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.274
I'm guessing
you want something.

53:54.318 --> 53:56.015
Do what you promised.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.321
Do what I what?

53:57.364 --> 54:00.280
Exonerate Craig.
Get his good name back.

54:00.324 --> 54:02.630
Alright, well,
as you've been advised,

54:02.674 --> 54:04.632
for a number of reasons,
that's not gonna happen.

54:04.676 --> 54:06.025
It is gonna happen.

54:06.068 --> 54:07.722
It is.

54:07.766 --> 54:10.203
It's -- You're just gonna
have to figure out a way.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.292
If anyone can do this,
it's you.

54:12.336 --> 54:14.816
I know you don't want us
going to Howard Hamlin.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.296
Because whatever it is
you're up to

54:16.340 --> 54:18.559
I'm sure he would be
very interested.

54:18.603 --> 54:20.996
Okay, let's just go easy
on the threats --

54:21.040 --> 54:23.303
We want
our lives back.

54:23.347 --> 54:27.133
The way they were befo--
before.

54:28.874 --> 54:32.138
We lost everything.

54:34.358 --> 54:35.881
And we didn't deserve
any of this.

54:35.924 --> 54:38.057
Okay.
Enough carrot.

54:42.670 --> 54:43.889
Dial 9 to get out.

54:43.932 --> 54:45.412
Kim:
Oh. Thank you.

54:45.456 --> 54:47.327
We didn't give her permission
to use the phone.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.807
Kim?

54:48.850 --> 54:51.897
She needed the phone.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.899
Woman: <i>Internal Revenue Service,</i> <i>
Albuquerque.</i>

54:53.942 --> 54:55.553
Hi,
could you put me through

54:55.596 --> 54:57.337
to Justin Stangel
in Criminal Investigations?

54:57.381 --> 54:58.773
<i>One moment,</i> <i>
please...</i>

54:58.817 --> 55:01.210
What are you doing?
Excuse me?

55:01.254 --> 55:02.951
<i>[Beeps]</i> <i>This is Justin.</i>

55:02.995 --> 55:05.127
Justin. Kim Wexler.
How are you?

55:05.171 --> 55:06.912
<i>Hey, Kim.</i> <i>
Good to hear from you.</i>

55:06.955 --> 55:09.175
How are Noreen
and the boys? <i>Oh, hangin' in.</i>

55:09.218 --> 55:10.611
<i>Noreen always talks about</i>

55:10.655 --> 55:12.178
<i>having you by</i> <i>
for dinner sometime.</i>

55:12.221 --> 55:14.093
We should do that.
Tell her to call me.

55:14.136 --> 55:15.355
Listen...
I was wondering

55:15.399 --> 55:17.009
who your CID officer is
these days.

55:17.052 --> 55:18.358
<i>You have something</i> <i>
for us?</i>

55:18.402 --> 55:20.186
Oh,
I just might.

55:20.229 --> 55:21.970
Tax preparer fraud.

55:22.014 --> 55:23.232
A lot of it.

55:23.276 --> 55:24.756
<i>I'm listening.</i>

55:24.799 --> 55:28.368
Well, it's this, uh, rundown
little mom and pop outfit

55:28.412 --> 55:30.152
I've had my eye on
for a while.

55:30.196 --> 55:31.545
Don't ask me why --

55:31.589 --> 55:33.112
clearly,
I need to get a life.

55:33.155 --> 55:36.289
But from what I can glean,
their clients always end up

55:36.333 --> 55:38.465
with smaller refunds
that they deserve.

55:38.509 --> 55:40.293
Please.
Don't do this.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.600
<i>Do the clients sign over</i> <i>
third-party authorization?</i>

55:42.643 --> 55:43.905
Bingo.

55:43.949 --> 55:45.820
So what I'm thinking
is these creeps

55:45.864 --> 55:47.561
file legit returns
with you guys,

55:47.605 --> 55:49.389
give the clients fake ones
that show

55:49.433 --> 55:52.174
about half the proper amount,
and then pocket the difference.

55:52.218 --> 55:53.915
<i>Classic scam.</i>

55:53.959 --> 55:56.222
<i>Well, I know just the guy</i> <i>
to go after these dirtbags.</i>

55:56.265 --> 55:58.093
<i>Tony Oropallo.</i> <i>
A real bulldog.</i>

55:58.137 --> 55:59.399
<i>I'll transfer you over.</i>

55:59.443 --> 56:00.922
Such a big help, Justin.

56:00.966 --> 56:02.533
<i>You got it.</i> <i>
Talk soon.</i>

56:02.576 --> 56:05.013
<i>[Hold music plays]</i> You don't
have to do this.

56:05.057 --> 56:06.406
Don't I?

56:06.450 --> 56:10.192
Betsy, you'll probably get
24 months...

56:10.236 --> 56:13.108
maybe 18
with good behavior.

56:13.152 --> 56:15.415
But Craig?
You are a two-time loser.

56:15.459 --> 56:18.026
They will definitely
make an example out of you.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.767
Each false return
they discover

56:19.811 --> 56:21.378
will be
a separate felony.

56:21.421 --> 56:24.424
What are we talking?
A hundred?

56:24.468 --> 56:26.295
Two hundred?

56:28.080 --> 56:30.474
<i>[Beeps]</i> <i>CID,</i> <i>
Anthony Oropallo speaking --</i>

56:35.914 --> 56:37.394
Please.

56:37.437 --> 56:40.309
We'll do anything.

56:40.353 --> 56:42.529
Just tell us.

56:44.096 --> 56:46.403
Why would I
believe you?

56:49.493 --> 56:51.233
Huh?

56:55.281 --> 56:58.197
Please.

57:02.723 --> 57:05.465
First...

57:05.509 --> 57:08.381
First, you contact
every person you've ripped off.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.470
Tell them you made
an accounting error,

57:10.514 --> 57:13.081
tell them you're crooks
who had a change of heart,

57:13.125 --> 57:14.474
I don't care.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.868
Give them
what they are legally owed.

57:16.911 --> 57:19.305
Everything you stole.

57:19.348 --> 57:21.742
And then, after that...
you're going to forget

57:21.786 --> 57:24.702
you ever heard the name
Howard Hamlin.

57:24.745 --> 57:27.400
I'm keeping my eye
on both of you.

57:31.230 --> 57:34.320
You think
you've lost everything?

57:34.363 --> 57:37.149
You have no idea.

57:56.734 --> 57:58.170
Mm.

58:15.404 --> 58:17.842
You gave them the money,
didn't you?

58:31.029 --> 58:33.553
Wolves and sheep.

58:33.597 --> 58:34.815
Huh?

58:34.859 --> 58:36.643
Nothing.

59:18.772 --> 59:20.600
Announcer: <i>On the final season</i> <i>
of "Better Call Saul"...</i>

59:20.644 --> 59:21.688

59:21.732 --> 59:22.863
What guy's that?

59:22.907 --> 59:24.386
Salamanca's guy.

59:25.910 --> 59:28.869
Are you building
some kind of case against Jimmy?

59:28.913 --> 59:30.392
That's a lot big talk.

What Colonel Sanders is
to chicken,

59:36.268 --> 59:38.313
Saul Goodman is
to the law.

It's just you

59:41.708 --> 59:44.798
Anyone who goes after
him is gonna have
to come through me.

59:49.411 --> 59:50.978
What happens now?

59:51.022 --> 59:52.676
I need to know
everything he does

59:52.719 --> 59:54.286
and everyone
he talks to.

59:55.679 --> 59:58.986
"I'm Saul Goodman. Pow.
I fight for you."
