Parker MacKenzie in Social Studies

11:49.600 --> 11:52.200

was telling me about Kate's aunt.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.967

that Kate's aunt was a Laker girl.

about to be put to the test.

your famous cheerleading aunt.

that she suddenly appears

from the social world.

you are grounded for one week,
