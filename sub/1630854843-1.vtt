can happen in performance.

07:41.193 --> 07:43.656
the seed from which
these grounds took root.

Ah!

- You're late.

07:51.723 --> 07:52.556
- Sorry.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.823

07:53.823 --> 07:55.173
- Oh, is that so?

07:55.173 --> 07:56.010
- [Peter] Yeah.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.753
- And if I check with him?

07:57.753 --> 07:59.973
- Then I'll know my word
means nothing to you,

07:59.973 --> 08:01.893
forever confirming that I am indeed

08:01.893 --> 08:03.443
the black sheep of this family.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.466
- Sit, watch, shut up.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.140
- [Girl] The year was 1945.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.873

08:31.893 --> 08:33.273

unsolicited input, Tommy.

- Course!

that this shit stirred my soul,

09:34.863 --> 09:35.916
she'd suck my dick?

09:37.083 --> 09:37.916
- What?

09:37.916 --> 09:39.063
- My dick, man.

09:39.063 --> 09:40.080

09:40.080 --> 09:40.923

09:40.923 --> 09:42.003

09:42.003 --> 09:43.233
Aren't you supposed to know all this shit?

09:43.233 --> 09:45.006

09:46.323 --> 09:47.493

09:47.493 --> 09:48.326
I need a swig.

Dylan, could I have a swig, please?

09:50.163 --> 09:51.667
I'm so thirsty.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.463
I haven't had anything
to drink since lunchtime,

09:53.463 --> 09:55.053
so my body chemistry is very-

09:55.053 --> 09:55.953
- Jesus Christ, Danny.

09:55.953 --> 09:57.006
Yeah. Fine.

09:58.821 --> 10:01.293
- It's Bug Juice, right?

10:01.293 --> 10:03.426
- Yeah. Sure, Bug Juice.

10:04.402 --> 10:05.659

10:05.659 --> 10:07.173

10:07.173 --> 10:08.423

10:09.453 --> 10:12.246

outdo yourselves every year.

10:34.773 --> 10:36.426
I'm looking at you, Martha.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.013
Meryl Streep can eat her heart out.

10:42.273 --> 10:47.273
Well, everyone, this has truly been

10:47.373 --> 10:50.643
one of the most memorable summers to date.

10:50.643 --> 10:53.433
From the archery range, to the mess hall,

10:53.433 --> 10:56.223
to the depths of Brewster Lake,

10:56.223 --> 11:01.223
you have all upheld the
sacred tenets of Briarbrook.

11:03.213 --> 11:05.256
The same promises, by the way,

11:06.483 --> 11:10.833
that my Evelyn and I shared

11:10.833 --> 11:14.316
on the day that we exchanged these rings.

11:16.713 --> 11:21.276
Devotion, loyalty, eternity.

11:22.388 --> 11:23.493
Hm?

11:23.493 --> 11:24.663
This may seem a little silly,

11:24.663 --> 11:29.663
but I haven't taken this off
my neck for 42 years now,

11:32.463 --> 11:36.143
ever since that first
summer, ever since she...

11:39.093 --> 11:42.433
It's a reminder of where we have come from

11:43.863 --> 11:46.146
and what we must continue to strive for.

11:47.313 --> 11:50.881
Remember. United we stand!

11:50.881 --> 11:52.586
- [Campers] Divided we fall!

11:52.586 --> 11:55.506
- Divided we fall. Exactly.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.936
And now, Steven, if you would, please.

Thank you.

And now, we'll see you
next summer, everyone!

12:55.179 --> 13:00.179
(upbeat music)
(campers cheer)

13:03.224 --> 13:04.557
- Yeah. Go home.

13:07.065 --> 13:09.732
(campers cheer)

13:13.183 --> 13:15.683
(bugle music)

13:19.653 --> 13:20.823

13:20.823 --> 13:21.656
- Bye.

13:21.656 --> 13:23.253
- Contact lenses.

13:23.253 --> 13:24.393
Don't look at me.

13:24.393 --> 13:25.226
Don't look at me.

13:25.226 --> 13:26.059
Get inside.

13:26.059 --> 13:27.033
Heads down.
- Don't be mean.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.293
- Your shorts don't match.

13:28.293 --> 13:30.003
All right, Miss Martha.

13:30.003 --> 13:32.253
I'm expecting a letter from
you once a week, you hear me?

13:32.253 --> 13:33.086
- Yes, Benny.

13:33.086 --> 13:34.263
- You were fearless out there today.

13:34.263 --> 13:35.223
I'm so proud of you.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.233
- I'll never forget you.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.253
- [Both] Do, re, mi, fa,

13:38.253 --> 13:40.113
boom, boom, bang, ah!

13:40.113 --> 13:41.133
- Great job.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.063
- I didn't know that.

13:42.063 --> 13:43.953
- I'll teach it to you next summer.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.033
- Hey, Ash.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.073
Make sure Danny doesn't wimp out tonight.

13:47.073 --> 13:49.067
He's been looking like a
little bitch all summer.

13:49.067 --> 13:49.900
(Ashley laughs)

13:49.900 --> 13:50.733
- Language, hey!

13:50.733 --> 13:52.533
- [Ashley] I'll do my best.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.366
- How are we looking?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.113
- Last bus home ready
for departure, Chief.

13:55.113 --> 13:56.373
- Great.

13:56.373 --> 13:58.353
Why don't you two start
breaking down the bunks?

13:58.353 --> 13:59.186
- You got it.

14:02.643 --> 14:03.873
- Ready to go?

14:03.873 --> 14:04.893
- Yeah.

14:04.893 --> 14:06.033
Engine's still overheating,

14:06.033 --> 14:08.850
but I think the old girl's
got a few miles left in her.

14:08.850 --> 14:10.900
- Uh, I thought Pete helped you fix that?

14:14.310 --> 14:15.453
Right.

14:15.453 --> 14:16.593
- He's gotta grow up, Mom.

14:16.593 --> 14:18.363
- Look, he's finding his way.

14:18.363 --> 14:19.196
- Yeah, yeah.

14:19.196 --> 14:20.730
That's what the first gap year was for.

14:20.730 --> 14:21.563
- Shawn.

14:21.563 --> 14:22.740
- [Shawn] I'm just saying.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.333
- And I appreciate it.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.133
But you're his brother, not his dad.

14:28.204 --> 14:30.753
- He's got people depending on him, Mom.

14:30.753 --> 14:32.736
Me, you.

14:34.233 --> 14:37.713
Lauren now, I guess
that's getting serious.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.033
- Look, he's just 21.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.293
- So what?

14:40.293 --> 14:41.433
With Grandpa retiring,

14:41.433 --> 14:43.383
if we want Briarbrook to survive-

14:43.383 --> 14:44.216
- Wait, what?

14:47.133 --> 14:49.263
- If we want this place to survive-

14:49.263 --> 14:50.096
- No.

14:51.873 --> 14:52.706
The other part.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.953
(somber music)

15:02.733 --> 15:03.566
You're leaving?

15:04.473 --> 15:06.423
- You are darned tooting.

15:06.423 --> 15:08.763
I haven't had a good
night's sleep all summer.

15:08.763 --> 15:11.403
Civilization is calling my name.

15:11.403 --> 15:12.516
- I mean for good.

15:14.403 --> 15:15.236
- Oh.

15:16.203 --> 15:17.793
- Jesus.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.143
- Listen-
- You told Shawn,

15:19.143 --> 15:19.976
but not me.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.273
- Heather-
- Your grandson,

15:21.273 --> 15:22.263
but not your daughter?

15:22.263 --> 15:24.393
- I told him I was thinking about it.

15:24.393 --> 15:27.093
- What happened to
"Bury me at Briarbrook"?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.006
- That doesn't mean I have to die here.

15:33.543 --> 15:35.343
- You're abandoning us.

15:35.343 --> 15:36.246
- Abandoning.

15:38.103 --> 15:38.936
Honey.

15:40.383 --> 15:41.466
Heather, come on.

15:42.363 --> 15:45.006
I have to pass the baton
on sooner or later.

15:45.873 --> 15:47.343
This place is always gonna be

15:47.343 --> 15:49.266
the richest chapter in my life.

15:51.603 --> 15:53.856
I just don't want it to be the only story.

15:55.983 --> 15:57.096
I have to move on.

15:59.613 --> 16:02.733
Besides, you've got help.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.983
- Have a great fall, Mr. McCalister.

16:04.983 --> 16:05.816
- You too.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.153
(upbeat music)

16:09.153 --> 16:10.653
She's good for him, isn't she?

16:11.493 --> 16:12.326
- Yeah.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.870
- I hope he doesn't fuck it up.

16:46.323 --> 16:47.793
Happy to.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.173
- I'm not normally one for nostalgia,

16:49.173 --> 16:52.143
but I kinda wanna remember my
last summer here, you know?

16:52.143 --> 16:54.723
- Whoa, slow down.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.556
Last summer?

16:57.157 --> 16:59.103

17:32.913 --> 17:34.983

17:34.983 --> 17:35.823
- You sound like Shawn.

17:35.823 --> 17:36.783
- Peter-
- Exactly.

17:36.783 --> 17:38.286
No, no, exactly like Shawn.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.853
Why is everyone so over
having a good time?

17:41.853 --> 17:43.743
We don't have many summers left to...

17:43.743 --> 17:45.873
Hey, where are you guys going?

17:45.873 --> 17:48.996
- We forgot to close up the
bunks on the south side.

17:49.947 --> 17:50.780
- So?

17:50.780 --> 17:52.563
- So we don't want your
mom blowing a gasket

17:52.563 --> 17:54.243
when she gets back.

17:54.243 --> 17:57.248
- What's she gonna do? Fire you?

17:57.248 --> 17:58.653
(both laugh)

17:58.653 --> 18:01.023
- We're not all McCalisters, Peter.

18:01.023 --> 18:02.523
- Careful. It's dark out there.

18:02.523 --> 18:04.053
- No worries, sis.

18:04.053 --> 18:05.406
I travel smart!

18:06.733 --> 18:07.983
- Give me that.

18:08.876 --> 18:10.053
Give me that back.

18:10.053 --> 18:11.373
- Hey, listen. Pizza's on the way.

18:11.373 --> 18:13.953
He's gonna honk three times
so you know he's here.

18:13.953 --> 18:15.393
- Great. Fine.

18:15.393 --> 18:16.413
You're just gonna miss-

18:16.413 --> 18:17.973
- Oh my god.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.333
His stupid ass...

18:23.313 --> 18:24.906
Agatha. Happy?

18:25.863 --> 18:26.696
- Pacified.

18:26.696 --> 18:28.323
- Yo, Ash.

18:28.323 --> 18:29.223
- Whoa, bitch.

18:29.223 --> 18:33.306
- Man. That skit today stirred my soul.

18:34.173 --> 18:35.346
- That's great, Dylan.

18:36.453 --> 18:38.313
- How's that make you feel?

18:38.313 --> 18:40.476
Your art stirred my soul.

18:42.363 --> 18:44.813
- Well, Ben wrote it, so...

18:47.139 --> 18:48.360
(Ash laughs)

18:48.360 --> 18:49.783
- Faggot.

18:49.783 --> 18:51.476
- Ew. He's disgusting.

18:51.476 --> 18:53.312
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

18:53.312 --> 18:56.979
(Ben and Ashley chattering)

19:00.513 --> 19:02.780
- Attention, Camp Briarbrook!

19:02.780 --> 19:04.623
Before we continue with the debauchery,

19:04.623 --> 19:07.473
we have a very important
tradition to honor this evening.

19:09.093 --> 19:11.043
Now we all know the story.

19:11.043 --> 19:12.693
42 years ago, Nurse Agatha

19:12.693 --> 19:14.163
gets kicked out of Camp Briarbrook

19:14.163 --> 19:19.163
after her homeopathic remedies
get a little too witchy.

19:19.239 --> 19:20.796
- Ooh!

19:22.323 --> 19:24.003
- She resurfaces a few years later

19:24.003 --> 19:25.053
when a counselor finds her

19:25.053 --> 19:27.093
giving secret midnight medicine classes

19:27.093 --> 19:28.536
to campers in the woods.

19:30.543 --> 19:32.313
She's confronted.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.366
The kids go ape shit.

19:34.293 --> 19:36.933
Agatha takes off, trips,

19:36.933 --> 19:40.326
splits her head open
on a rock, bleeds out.

19:40.326 --> 19:43.323
(Peter moans)

19:43.323 --> 19:47.205
Ding dong, the bitch is dead.

19:47.205 --> 19:48.843
(Dylan laughs)

19:48.843 --> 19:50.103
- [Veronica] So gross.

19:50.103 --> 19:51.006
- Seconded.

19:52.533 --> 19:57.533
- But then this eerie calm
takes over the forest.

20:00.693 --> 20:05.693
All at once, the campers gather
around Agatha, grab hands,

20:06.723 --> 20:09.396
and begin to recite an
incantation until sunrise.

20:13.053 --> 20:15.073
Ex vitam immortalem.

20:19.646 --> 20:21.313
Ex vitam immortalem.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.713
Come on, say it with me!

20:28.713 --> 20:30.393
- [Group] Immortal life!

20:30.393 --> 20:31.506
- That's right!

20:32.430 --> 20:33.783
Now I know we've all been trying

20:33.783 --> 20:35.973
to bring this hag back for years,

20:35.973 --> 20:39.243
late nights in the bathroom,
the bunks, the woods,

20:39.243 --> 20:41.993
chanting for her like she
was Bloody Mary or something,

20:42.873 --> 20:47.256
but, guys, it's time to forget
the cute little limericks.

20:49.353 --> 20:51.783
If you'll please direct your
attention to Mondo Mike-

20:51.783 --> 20:53.144
- [Dylan] Boo, no one likes you, Mike.

20:53.144 --> 20:54.123
(Peter laughs)

20:54.123 --> 20:55.293
- [Peter] You'll notice
that he's distributing

20:55.293 --> 20:57.783
medical grade needles to each of you.

20:57.783 --> 21:01.293
You see, I've uncovered
the secret ingredient

21:01.293 --> 21:05.463
in our mission.
- Thank you.

21:05.463 --> 21:06.863
- We need to hurt ourselves.

21:08.073 --> 21:12.003
Not a lot, just enough so
that Agatha has something

21:12.003 --> 21:13.593
to come back and heal.

21:13.593 --> 21:15.153
- [Kellie] Really?

21:15.153 --> 21:17.013
- Yeah, no. I don't know.

21:17.013 --> 21:18.663
- It'll be fun. Trust me.

21:18.663 --> 21:20.038
- Yeah, but I mean, like-

21:20.038 --> 21:21.603
- Hey.

21:21.603 --> 21:23.886
It's not gonna hurt. I promise.

21:24.873 --> 21:26.973
- Now, on the count of
three, we prick our finger,

21:26.973 --> 21:28.983
hold it up to the sky,
and scream her name.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.873
- Peter, are these needles clean?

21:30.873 --> 21:33.663
I mean, as fun as this whole
blood brothers thing sounds,

21:33.663 --> 21:37.023
I'm not looking to end the
summer with some grodie disease.

21:37.023 --> 21:38.013
- Excellent question, Kellie.

21:38.013 --> 21:39.126
Yes!

21:40.023 --> 21:43.296
Yes. These needles are
sterile and ritual-ready.

21:44.343 --> 21:47.496
The question is, are you?

21:51.783 --> 21:52.616
- [Danny] I am.

21:57.633 --> 21:58.593
- Okay.

21:58.593 --> 21:59.543
- Thank you, Danny!

22:00.423 --> 22:02.436
That's the spirit Danny boy! Yes, sir!

22:06.243 --> 22:07.093
Then let's do it.

22:09.693 --> 22:12.213
Three, two, one.

22:15.264 --> 22:16.681
- [Group] Agatha!

22:21.538 --> 22:22.761
(Dylan screams)

22:22.761 --> 22:25.677
(group screams)

22:25.677 --> 22:26.873
(Dylan grunting)

22:26.873 --> 22:29.223
- Wow, Dylan. Real original.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.773
- It fucking worked, didn't it?

22:32.043 --> 22:32.876
Didn't it?!

22:36.393 --> 22:38.080
Fuck you all.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.586
Fucking idiots.

22:42.586 --> 22:44.466
- All right. Let's go to the beach.

22:46.074 --> 22:49.513
(engine putters)
- Come on.

22:49.513 --> 22:51.217
(engine putters)

22:51.217 --> 22:52.050
Come on!

22:53.763 --> 22:56.076
Come on, you son of a bitch! Pete!

22:58.668 --> 23:03.668
(kids chattering)
(ominous music)

23:06.123 --> 23:08.403
- Excuse me, Shawn. How much longer?

23:08.403 --> 23:09.893
I'm trying to calculate
when I should eat my snack

23:09.893 --> 23:11.983
so my blood sugar stays stable.

23:11.983 --> 23:15.358
(kids chattering)

23:15.358 --> 23:17.381
- I don't know, Dennis.

23:17.381 --> 23:20.692
(kids chattering)

23:20.692 --> 23:22.275
Hey, do me a favor?

23:23.393 --> 23:24.813
Do you think you can get your friends

23:24.813 --> 23:27.529
to play the quiet game
for like five minutes?

23:27.529 --> 23:29.433
(children chattering)

23:29.433 --> 23:32.173
- You and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

23:32.173 --> 23:33.653
(children chattering loudly)

23:33.653 --> 23:37.473
- [Kid 1] I'm also a bit afraid of sharks.

23:37.473 --> 23:39.657
Yeah, especially hammerhead sharks.

23:39.657 --> 23:41.701
- [Kid 2] Those are my
favorite kind of shark!

23:41.701 --> 23:45.201
(children yelling loudly)

23:52.829 --> 23:56.079
(children fall silent)

24:14.323 --> 24:15.843
- Good, yeah.

24:15.843 --> 24:16.676
All right.

24:19.173 --> 24:20.006
Quiet game.

24:23.553 --> 24:24.386
Good job, guys.

24:28.923 --> 24:29.756
All right.

24:47.523 --> 24:48.356
Fuck.

24:51.464 --> 24:53.051
(radiator hissing)

24:53.051 --> 24:55.634
(Shawn coughs)

25:04.083 --> 25:05.013
All right, guys.

25:05.013 --> 25:07.013
It looks like we're gonna be here for...

25:09.086 --> 25:11.753
(ominous music)

25:12.933 --> 25:14.406
What the fuck?

25:17.308 --> 25:19.023
(children chattering)

25:19.023 --> 25:20.652
- [Kid] He can see me.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.606
(ominous music)

25:22.606 --> 25:23.439
- Hey!

25:26.446 --> 25:27.279
Hey!

25:29.798 --> 25:30.631
Dennis!

25:32.941 --> 25:33.946
Tony!

25:33.946 --> 25:35.506
(children laughing)

25:35.506 --> 25:36.339
Martha!

25:37.624 --> 25:40.665
(ominous music)
(children chattering)

25:40.665 --> 25:42.347
- [Kid] Briarbrook.

25:42.347 --> 25:43.951
Briarbrook.
- Shit!

25:43.951 --> 25:45.951
- [Children] Briarbrook!

25:47.226 --> 25:49.449
- This is excruciating.

25:49.449 --> 25:51.183
- The shot clock's winding down.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.623
Please, make a move now.

25:52.623 --> 25:53.573
- What's happening?

25:54.723 --> 25:56.283
- Nothing.

25:56.283 --> 25:57.156
- Figures.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.043
♪ Tell me why you're all alone ♪

26:01.043 --> 26:03.963
(rock splashes)

26:03.963 --> 26:05.013
- [Danny] Can I help?

26:06.633 --> 26:07.466
- Sure.

26:09.993 --> 26:11.493
I should've known better than to practice

26:11.493 --> 26:12.873
where everyone could see me.

26:12.873 --> 26:14.703
- Yeah, I'm not gonna judge.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.074
I promise.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.283
- Well, I hope not, Danny.

26:17.283 --> 26:19.113
It's just skipping stones.

26:19.113 --> 26:20.763
- Okay, Kellie Parker.

26:20.763 --> 26:21.943
Do you want my help or not?

26:21.943 --> 26:26.196
- Well, Danny Patterson, I
think it was you who offered.

26:29.553 --> 26:31.503
- You're using the wrong rocks.

26:31.503 --> 26:32.336
- [Kellie] Oh?

26:34.323 --> 26:35.156
- May I?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.136
- [Kellie] Sure.

26:38.673 --> 26:40.443
- Um, okay.

26:40.443 --> 26:42.183
Well, there's this common misconception

26:42.183 --> 26:44.943
that your thumb is
supposed to go on the side,

26:44.943 --> 26:49.536
but it's actually supposed
to be on the top, like that.

26:50.763 --> 26:54.843
And then you move your
body in this position,

26:54.843 --> 26:56.676
and you angle, like that.

26:58.533 --> 27:03.533
And move your arm back, and release.

27:05.673 --> 27:06.744
Theoretically.

27:06.744 --> 27:08.763
(Kellie laughs)

27:08.763 --> 27:09.876
- A valiant effort.

27:14.733 --> 27:15.566
Danny?

27:16.503 --> 27:17.336
- Yeah?

27:18.513 --> 27:20.213
- Can I have my hand back, please?

27:21.406 --> 27:22.596
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:28.203 --> 27:29.036
- Um...

27:30.243 --> 27:31.076
- Shit.

27:32.163 --> 27:35.223
- Danny, uh, listen.

27:35.223 --> 27:37.623
I have this guy back at school.

27:37.623 --> 27:38.456
- No, you don't.

27:40.203 --> 27:41.133
- Excuse me?

27:41.133 --> 27:41.966
- I would've...

27:41.966 --> 27:43.120
Someone would have told me.

27:44.169 --> 27:45.272
- What?

27:45.272 --> 27:46.626
- Kellie, come on.

27:46.626 --> 27:47.486
- Come on, what?

27:47.486 --> 27:48.843
- Kellie, it doesn't have to be forever,

27:48.843 --> 27:49.676
just let me-

27:49.676 --> 27:50.509
- Let you?

27:50.509 --> 27:51.363
Jesus, Danny!
- Kellie, please.

27:51.363 --> 27:54.273
- You know what, going along
with this whole late night,

27:54.273 --> 27:56.283
let me show you how it's
done thing, that's on me.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.413
I'm sorry, but...

27:58.852 --> 28:01.435
(upbeat music)

28:11.520 --> 28:12.353
- Pay up.

28:13.398 --> 28:16.473
(Peter sighs)

28:16.473 --> 28:18.003
Thank you.

28:18.003 --> 28:18.843
- Finders keepers.

28:18.843 --> 28:20.073
- Hey! No.

28:20.073 --> 28:20.906
Give that back.

28:20.906 --> 28:21.739
- Come on, what's it worth to you?

28:21.739 --> 28:24.582
- You jackass!
- Come on, earn it!

28:24.582 --> 28:26.183
(Veronica bickering)

28:26.183 --> 28:27.154
(Dylan laughs)

28:27.154 --> 28:28.411
- [Veronica] Are you
fucking serious right now?

28:28.411 --> 28:29.553
Give it back to me.

28:29.553 --> 28:31.515
Dylan, what the actual fuck?
- Come on, you can get it.

28:31.515 --> 28:32.598
- No, stop!
- Aren't you fast?

28:32.598 --> 28:35.195
I thought you ran track?
- Stupid idiot.

28:35.195 --> 28:36.170
(indistinct)

28:36.170 --> 28:37.511
- No, I can't, I can't.

28:37.511 --> 28:38.344
I can't.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.173
- Are you okay?

28:43.173 --> 28:44.133
- Yeah, yeah.

28:44.133 --> 28:48.873
It's just, there's this
guy back at Dartmouth.

28:48.873 --> 28:50.886
It's not totally official.

28:52.113 --> 28:54.813
- Oh. I don't think you've
mentioned him before.

28:54.813 --> 28:57.093
- No, no, I just,

28:57.093 --> 28:58.863
he's been writing me letters all summer

28:58.863 --> 29:00.513
telling me how rad he thinks I am,

29:00.513 --> 29:02.063
and I've written a couple back.

29:04.983 --> 29:06.363
- Do you like him?

29:06.363 --> 29:07.323
- Who, Danny?

29:07.323 --> 29:08.156
Or...

29:09.093 --> 29:10.569
- Either.

29:10.569 --> 29:14.071
- Uh, I don't know.

29:14.071 --> 29:18.536
The Dartmouth guy, uh,
he's there, you know?

29:18.536 --> 29:19.469
- [Danny] Kellie.

29:19.469 --> 29:20.486
- Oh, Danny, I-

29:20.486 --> 29:21.579
(rock thuds)

29:21.579 --> 29:22.412
- [Peter] Shit!

29:22.412 --> 29:23.375
(rock thudding)
(Danny grunting)

29:23.375 --> 29:24.208
- Back up!
- Danny!

29:24.208 --> 29:25.166
- Back up!
(Lauren screams)

29:25.166 --> 29:26.426
- [Lauren] Danny, what the fuck!

29:26.426 --> 29:28.453
- Jeez!
(Lauren screams)

29:28.453 --> 29:29.856
- Danny, what the fuck?!

29:29.856 --> 29:30.814
Danny!

29:30.814 --> 29:32.443
- Peter!

29:32.443 --> 29:33.651
Peter!

29:33.651 --> 29:35.368
- Fucking psycho!

29:35.368 --> 29:37.932
(ominous music)

29:37.932 --> 29:38.765
- [Mike] Back up!

29:38.765 --> 29:40.180
Back up!

29:40.180 --> 29:42.152
(Danny screams)

29:42.152 --> 29:44.819
(ominous music)

29:52.337 --> 29:55.254
(Veronica panting)

29:57.703 --> 30:00.870
(Danny cries in pain)

30:02.269 --> 30:04.936
(ominous music)

30:12.156 --> 30:14.823
(Danny screams)

30:21.628 --> 30:23.788
(Danny screams)

30:23.788 --> 30:26.455
(ominous music)

30:33.969 --> 30:34.802
- Mike?

30:38.432 --> 30:39.265
Mike?

30:41.612 --> 30:42.963
- We gotta...

30:42.963 --> 30:44.930
We gotta get to the mess hall.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.403
We gotta call the cops, okay?

30:47.403 --> 30:50.070
We gotta call the cops.
(Veronica hyperventilates)

30:50.070 --> 30:52.443
- Hey, it's okay. Look at me.
- Yeah? It's okay, Lauren?

30:52.443 --> 30:53.276
This is okay to you?

30:53.276 --> 30:55.693
- All right, everybody
just calm the fuck down.

30:55.693 --> 30:56.526
- [Lauren] It's okay, it's okay.

30:56.526 --> 30:57.366
- This just happened.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.403
I don't know why, but it did,

30:59.403 --> 31:01.143
and the longer we wait to do something,

31:01.143 --> 31:02.043
the worse it's gonna get.

31:02.043 --> 31:03.123
- Yeah, Mike, it's gonna get worse.

31:03.123 --> 31:04.173
It's gonna get worse than this?!

31:04.173 --> 31:05.973
- Dylan, I swear to fucking God,

31:05.973 --> 31:07.023
now's not the time!

31:07.023 --> 31:08.493
- What? Are you fucking kidding me, man?

31:08.493 --> 31:09.429
You just stabbed a guy!

31:09.429 --> 31:10.262
- She's dead!

31:10.262 --> 31:11.643
- [Dylan] You're gonna
stab more fucking people?!

31:11.643 --> 31:12.476
- Fuck you!

31:14.220 --> 31:18.803
(counselors chattering simultaneously)

31:20.043 --> 31:21.543
- One at a time!

31:21.543 --> 31:23.193
- Something happened
at the lake with Danny.

31:23.193 --> 31:24.026
- Is he hurt?

31:24.026 --> 31:26.796
- He killed Kellie, and I killed him.

31:28.023 --> 31:28.856
- What?

31:28.856 --> 31:30.333
- Dude just fucking snapped.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.503
- Danny wouldn't do that.

31:31.503 --> 31:32.793
- Yeah?

31:32.793 --> 31:34.326
Well, he fucking did.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.438
(ominous music)

31:44.413 --> 31:47.523
- I'm gonna call the police.

31:47.523 --> 31:49.461
- [Veronica] I wanna go now.
- [Lauren] It's gonna be okay.

31:49.461 --> 31:52.103
- Hey, we're gonna figure
this out, all right?

31:52.103 --> 31:52.936
It's gonna be okay.

31:52.936 --> 31:54.693
- Ben and Ashley, they
weren't at the beach.

31:54.693 --> 31:56.013
They went (indistinct) remember?

31:56.013 --> 31:56.846
- [Mike] She's right.

31:56.846 --> 31:58.233
- What?
- They're still down there.

31:58.233 --> 31:59.066
- Oh, shit!

31:59.066 --> 31:59.899
- Yes...

31:59.899 --> 32:03.091
(telephone explodes)
(Heather screams)

32:03.091 --> 32:04.627
- Oh! Damn it!

32:04.627 --> 32:06.486
- Oh, shit!

32:06.486 --> 32:08.283
What the hell? We need to find someone.

32:08.283 --> 32:09.483
- Your grandfather took the truck.

32:09.483 --> 32:11.083
He's not due back 'til tomorrow.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.743
- Guys, what are we supposed to do?

32:13.743 --> 32:15.963
- Shawn, he's coming back in an hour.

32:15.963 --> 32:16.923
- I'll go to the infirmary.

32:16.923 --> 32:17.943
I'll get something to help.

32:17.943 --> 32:20.403
- I have gauze, just find antiseptic.

32:20.403 --> 32:21.453
It should be in the attic.

32:21.453 --> 32:23.343
- Ben and Ashley, you said...

32:23.343 --> 32:24.213
- Breaking down the bunks.

32:24.213 --> 32:25.046
- [Heather] Still?

32:25.046 --> 32:26.013
- South side. They forgot some.

32:26.013 --> 32:27.753
- You've gotta bring 'em back.
We've gotta go find them.

32:27.753 --> 32:29.223
- The threat is gone.

32:29.223 --> 32:30.056
- Is it?

32:30.056 --> 32:31.263
How do we know for sure Danny's dead?

32:31.263 --> 32:33.423
- Mike stuck him like a fucking pig!

32:33.423 --> 32:36.629
- Two stabs off to the side.

32:36.629 --> 32:39.379
I don't know if he's dead either.

32:40.790 --> 32:41.763
- I'll go to the intercom.

32:41.763 --> 32:43.863
- Pete, those speakers have
been faulty all summer.

32:43.863 --> 32:46.113
That last storm knocked
out like half of 'em.

32:48.089 --> 32:49.756
- It's worth a shot.

32:56.283 --> 32:57.813
- Hey. I'm gonna go look for them.

32:57.813 --> 32:59.193
- No.

32:59.193 --> 33:00.513
- Not alone.

33:00.513 --> 33:01.626
No one alone.

33:03.543 --> 33:04.683
Dylan, go with him.

33:04.683 --> 33:05.973
- Fuck that!

33:05.973 --> 33:07.713
You want the buddy system, you go.

33:07.713 --> 33:08.733
- I'm not asking.

33:08.733 --> 33:09.963
- You're not my boss anymore.

33:09.963 --> 33:11.013
- You know, Dylan.

33:11.013 --> 33:12.393
For someone who thinks the threat is gone,

33:12.393 --> 33:14.763
you sure sound a lot like a pussy.

33:14.763 --> 33:15.693
- We doing this, bro?

33:15.693 --> 33:16.863
- You want to do this now?

33:16.863 --> 33:18.377
- If you hadn't fucking stabbed people!

33:18.377 --> 33:22.294
(group yelling simultaneously)

33:25.143 --> 33:28.536
- First, we check the
beach, just to make sure.

33:29.733 --> 33:31.076
Then we find them. Okay?

33:34.465 --> 33:35.298
- Okay.

33:38.013 --> 33:38.846
- Okay.

33:39.993 --> 33:40.826
Lead the way.

33:55.427 --> 33:56.260
- Fuck!

34:09.577 --> 34:12.409
(telephone rings)

34:14.129 --> 34:15.212
- I'm coming.

34:19.713 --> 34:21.483
Hey, it's after nine.

34:21.483 --> 34:22.789
This had better-
- Grandpa.

34:22.789 --> 34:23.966
Fuck.

34:23.966 --> 34:24.799
Jesus.

34:24.799 --> 34:25.632
- Shawn?

34:26.757 --> 34:28.913
- [Shawn] I don't know what happened.

34:28.913 --> 34:31.246
Pete did the fucking ritual!

34:32.703 --> 34:34.103
Fuck!

34:34.103 --> 34:35.523
(ominous music)

34:35.523 --> 34:36.396
- I'm on my way.

34:37.357 --> 34:40.024
(ominous music)

34:48.393 --> 34:49.226
- Yeah.

34:53.553 --> 34:55.342
He's definitely dead.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.253
(Veronica sobs)

34:56.253 --> 34:58.053
- Hey, hey.

34:58.053 --> 34:59.076
I got you, V.

35:01.217 --> 35:03.243
- They went south side, right?

35:03.243 --> 35:04.076
Ben and Ashley?

35:05.343 --> 35:07.563
- Yeah, but they could be anywhere by now.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.873
Maybe we should split up, hm?

35:09.873 --> 35:11.673
Me and V. could go off this way,

35:11.673 --> 35:13.473
and you can go fuck off into the woods

35:13.473 --> 35:15.483
and jerk off using your own tears as lube.

35:15.483 --> 35:16.623
- We're not doing that, Dylan.

35:16.623 --> 35:17.553
- Oh, yeah?

35:17.553 --> 35:19.653
And who put you in charge?

35:19.653 --> 35:20.793
I'm the oldest counselor.

35:20.793 --> 35:22.413
- Yeah, no shit.

35:22.413 --> 35:23.246
- Watch it!

35:23.246 --> 35:26.676
- Look, it's what Heather
said. No one alone.

35:27.963 --> 35:28.913
Let's go find them.

35:30.093 --> 35:30.926
Come on.

35:33.139 --> 35:35.027
(ominous music)

35:35.027 --> 35:35.944
Don't look.

35:37.111 --> 35:39.778
(ominous music)

36:02.736 --> 36:05.069
(crows caw)

36:06.277 --> 36:08.944
(ominous music)

36:53.665 --> 36:56.415
(animal squeaks)

37:13.695 --> 37:16.362
(ominous music)

37:48.395 --> 37:51.062
(ominous music)

38:11.333 --> 38:14.190
(Ben chattering indistinctly)

38:14.190 --> 38:15.843
(Ashley laughs)

38:15.843 --> 38:16.863
- [Ashley] All right, Benny Ben.

38:16.863 --> 38:18.453
You take the bunks on the right,

38:18.453 --> 38:19.563
and I'll take the ones on the left.

38:19.563 --> 38:20.583
- [Ben] The twins slept in there.

38:20.583 --> 38:21.416
- [Ashley] So?

38:22.584 --> 38:24.274
- It's gross.
- Come on.

38:24.274 --> 38:25.383
- [Ben] I'll do it.

38:25.383 --> 38:26.216
You owe me.

38:32.823 --> 38:34.085
Dirtiest bunk in the entire world.

38:34.085 --> 38:35.918
This disgusting place.

38:41.877 --> 38:43.089
If this sock's been on someone's foot,

38:43.089 --> 38:44.922
I'm gonna kill myself.

38:52.563 --> 38:55.480
(door creaks open)

39:00.635 --> 39:01.468
Hello?

39:05.243 --> 39:07.393
We don't have any
stowaways in here, do we?

39:10.016 --> 39:12.933
(door creaks open)

39:15.106 --> 39:16.830
(door slams shut)

39:16.830 --> 39:17.663
(Ben screams)

39:17.663 --> 39:18.496
- What? Whoa, calm down.

39:18.496 --> 39:19.329
- Did you see that?

39:19.329 --> 39:20.162
- See what?

39:20.162 --> 39:22.983
- The door. It just, like, slammed shut.

39:22.983 --> 39:24.243
- Okay, Ben.

39:24.243 --> 39:25.503
- I'm serious, Ash.

39:25.503 --> 39:26.793
- It was probably just the wind.

39:26.793 --> 39:27.823
- The wind?

39:27.823 --> 39:30.131
(light crackles)

39:30.131 --> 39:31.866
- (laughs) Is that a ghost too?

39:33.633 --> 39:36.466
(light crackling)

39:43.623 --> 39:44.979
- Just bad wiring.

39:44.979 --> 39:46.976
- [Peter On Intercom] Ben? Ashley?

39:46.976 --> 39:47.964
If you're there, please-

39:47.964 --> 39:48.964
- Oh my god.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.843
- [Peter On Intercom] Ben? Ashley?

39:51.843 --> 39:55.083
- Probably just trying to
get us to pay for the pizza.

39:55.083 --> 39:55.916
We gotta finish. Come on.

39:55.916 --> 39:58.180
- [Peter On Intercom] Ben! Ashley!

39:59.853 --> 40:00.853
- [Ashley] You good?

40:02.373 --> 40:03.306
- Yeah. Sorry.

40:05.343 --> 40:06.643
- [Ashley] You're so cute.

40:11.313 --> 40:12.146
- Ben!

40:13.353 --> 40:14.186
Ashley!

40:19.533 --> 40:20.883
- You scared?

40:20.883 --> 40:21.716
- Obviously.

40:21.716 --> 40:22.866
- Yeah, totally.

40:23.823 --> 40:27.516
You want to, uh, fool around or something?

40:28.724 --> 40:29.557
- What?

40:29.557 --> 40:31.803
- You know, just get
our minds off all this.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.093
- What the fuck?

40:33.093 --> 40:34.773
- Yo, relax.

40:34.773 --> 40:36.513
- My best friend is dead!

40:36.513 --> 40:38.316
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

40:39.273 --> 40:41.523
- You wanna fuck me to
get my mind off of it?

40:42.693 --> 40:43.584
- Yeah.

40:43.584 --> 40:44.623
(blow thuds)
(Dylan screams)

40:44.623 --> 40:46.173
- Asshole!

40:46.173 --> 40:48.513
- What the hell, V?!

40:48.513 --> 40:49.563
You bitch!

40:49.563 --> 40:50.796
- Fuck. Dylan!

40:52.353 --> 40:54.276
Veronica! Come back!

40:56.193 --> 40:57.513
Jesus, what is wrong with you?

40:57.513 --> 40:59.643
- Me?
- Yeah, you, asshole!

40:59.643 --> 41:02.133
- You know, I've been letting
you slide all summer, Mike.

41:02.133 --> 41:02.966
- What?

41:02.966 --> 41:04.563
- Yeah, you heard me right!

41:04.563 --> 41:05.553
- I don't even know where to begin.

41:05.553 --> 41:06.993
- You've been cock blocking me

41:06.993 --> 41:08.793
every fucking chance you get, man.

41:08.793 --> 41:10.803
- Jesus, how thick are you?

41:10.803 --> 41:12.993
- I bet V. would say I'm
pretty fucking thick.

41:12.993 --> 41:14.493
- Dylan, she's not gonna sleep with you!

41:14.493 --> 41:15.326
Nobody is!

41:15.326 --> 41:16.884
- Hey!

41:16.884 --> 41:18.206
(Dylan screams)

41:18.206 --> 41:20.166
Ah! Motherfucker!

41:23.013 --> 41:24.229
- What are you...

41:24.229 --> 41:26.979
(blows thudding)

41:27.888 --> 41:30.322
(Veronica screams)

41:30.322 --> 41:31.923
(ominous music)

41:31.923 --> 41:32.756
- Get off me!

41:37.806 --> 41:39.417
(ominous music)

41:39.417 --> 41:40.805
- Ben?

41:40.805 --> 41:42.413
Ashley?

41:42.413 --> 41:45.066
If you can hear me, please
meet in the mess hall.

41:47.373 --> 41:49.923
Ben, Ashley, something
fucking horrible has happened.

41:49.923 --> 41:52.866
Please, meet in the mess
hall right now! We need you!

41:54.093 --> 41:57.363
Ben, Ashley, please come
to the mess hall now.

41:57.363 --> 41:58.296
Please.

42:03.303 --> 42:04.153
- [Lauren] Peter?

42:07.113 --> 42:09.063
- I'm gonna try again in a few minutes.

42:10.473 --> 42:12.173
- [Lauren] No, I...

42:13.713 --> 42:14.546
- What?

42:16.953 --> 42:18.403
- [Lauren] I found something.

42:31.833 --> 42:32.983
- Lauren, what is this?

42:34.438 --> 42:36.606
- Old medical records, I think.

42:40.233 --> 42:41.613
Your mom, she...

42:41.613 --> 42:44.090
Wasn't this around the
same time as that story?

42:44.090 --> 42:45.303
- Don't. Don't.

42:45.303 --> 42:46.306
- Peter, I'm serious.

42:46.306 --> 42:47.363
- I am too.

42:47.363 --> 42:49.855
- Do you think maybe the ritual
thing might have caused...

42:49.855 --> 42:50.954
- No, of course not!

42:50.954 --> 42:52.923
It's just some bullshit legend.

42:52.923 --> 42:54.993
- I saw his eyes. That wasn't Danny.

42:54.993 --> 42:57.873
- Lauren, how well do we
really know these people?

42:57.873 --> 43:00.633
We see them, what, two
months every summer?

43:00.633 --> 43:01.863
- Yeah.

43:01.863 --> 43:03.723
Every summer for the past 10 years.

43:03.723 --> 43:04.556
Your brother was right,

43:04.556 --> 43:06.183
we shouldn't have messed with this stuff.

43:06.183 --> 43:09.063
- Lauren, she's not real, okay?

43:09.063 --> 43:10.613
Just some bullshit story
the counselors made up

43:10.613 --> 43:13.293
to keep the kids from
leaving their bunks at night.

43:13.293 --> 43:14.537
That's it.

43:14.537 --> 43:15.816
There is no Agatha.

43:17.073 --> 43:18.476
- [Heather] What did you say?

43:20.297 --> 43:22.964
(ominous music)

43:27.993 --> 43:28.826
- V?

43:36.513 --> 43:37.506
- You first, pussy.

43:41.193 --> 43:42.593
- You ever seen this before?

43:44.788 --> 43:45.621
- No.

43:45.621 --> 43:48.167
(branch snaps)
(children giggling)

43:48.167 --> 43:49.000
- Ben?

43:51.470 --> 43:52.303
Ash?

43:55.966 --> 43:59.306
(ominous music)

43:59.306 --> 44:02.139
(person gurgling)

44:03.845 --> 44:06.512
(ominous music)

44:17.194 --> 44:20.027
(person gurgling)

44:29.941 --> 44:31.628
- Oh, shit!

44:31.628 --> 44:32.723
(children laughing)

44:32.723 --> 44:33.556
Oh my god, V!

44:33.556 --> 44:34.878
What the fuck happened?

44:34.878 --> 44:36.449
V, what the fuck?!

44:36.449 --> 44:39.449
(children laughing)

44:41.730 --> 44:46.730
(men scream)
(Veronica screams)

44:49.057 --> 44:51.123
(children laughing)

44:51.123 --> 44:53.016
- My dad told me he burned this.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.226
I tried to forget.

45:00.303 --> 45:01.836
She was supposed to disappear.

45:03.183 --> 45:04.053
- Mom, she can't be-

45:04.053 --> 45:05.706
- Peter, let her speak.

45:12.910 --> 45:16.683
- It had been going on all summer long.

45:16.683 --> 45:17.676
Little things.

45:19.203 --> 45:21.756
Cuts, scrapes, bruises.

45:26.613 --> 45:28.493
Dad thought I was just clumsy, but...

45:33.385 --> 45:35.052
I never told anyone.

45:38.943 --> 45:40.206
I thought it was just me.

45:43.803 --> 45:45.336
She said I was special,

45:47.253 --> 45:51.113
strong enough to withstand
her experimental treatments.

45:56.523 --> 45:57.456
- Treatments?

46:02.493 --> 46:04.076
- Bloodletting.

46:04.076 --> 46:06.743
(ominous music)

46:09.243 --> 46:10.893
That night was different, though.

46:13.113 --> 46:14.763
Something drew us into the woods,

46:16.642 --> 46:18.142
all of us, as one.

46:31.143 --> 46:32.616
And then the sunrise came,

46:35.163 --> 46:36.816
and it all seemed to melt away,

46:40.233 --> 46:41.066
like a dream.

46:44.643 --> 46:46.243
So that's what we let it become.

46:49.010 --> 46:51.677
(ominous music)

46:53.973 --> 46:55.803
Any fragmented memory we had

46:55.803 --> 46:57.696
became part of a shared nightmare,

46:59.853 --> 47:01.653
fueled by the shadows we all see

47:01.653 --> 47:03.426
when we walk in the woods at night,

47:06.513 --> 47:07.836
an urban legend.

47:15.363 --> 47:17.166
A stupid campfire story.

47:24.614 --> 47:27.197
(sirens blare)

47:31.803 --> 47:33.281
Jerry, thank God.

47:33.281 --> 47:34.114
- Heather!

47:35.111 --> 47:35.944
What's going on?

47:35.944 --> 47:37.083
Dispatch tried calling back,

47:37.083 --> 47:37.916
but no one picked up.

47:37.916 --> 47:40.473
- Well, the phone short
circuited 20 minutes ago.

47:40.473 --> 47:41.403
Took my ear with it.

47:41.403 --> 47:42.513
- Oh, Jesus.

47:42.513 --> 47:44.583
Why didn't you try another phone?

47:44.583 --> 47:46.293
- It's the only one here.

47:46.293 --> 47:47.126
- Still?

47:48.633 --> 47:49.866
- There's been a murder.

47:51.093 --> 47:53.546
And a couple of counselors
are still unaccounted for.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.496
- Okay, hang tight.

47:55.496 --> 47:56.676
I'll call for backup.

48:11.643 --> 48:13.623
Ragsdale, this is Matthews

48:13.623 --> 48:15.923
requesting immediate
assistance at Briarbrook.

48:18.406 --> 48:19.239
Ragsdale?

48:21.416 --> 48:24.166
(engine putters)

48:28.031 --> 48:28.864
Ragsdale.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.710
(engine putters)

48:38.751 --> 48:41.501
(engine putters)

48:48.033 --> 48:48.866
Heather.

48:51.123 --> 48:51.956
Who?

48:54.033 --> 48:55.263
- Danny Patterson.

48:55.263 --> 48:56.096
- Danny?

48:57.903 --> 48:59.523
Christ, he's like, what, 20?

48:59.523 --> 49:00.723
Why would he do something like this?

49:00.723 --> 49:02.853
- I don't know.
- Well, is he still out there?

49:02.853 --> 49:04.248
- Hey!
- Heather!

49:04.248 --> 49:05.643
Heather, help!
- Help!

49:05.643 --> 49:07.263
- [Officer Matthews]
Hey, hang on, hang on!

49:07.263 --> 49:08.096
Hey, hey!
- Oh my god!

49:08.096 --> 49:09.393
- What the hell happened?

49:09.393 --> 49:10.473
- She's dead!

49:10.473 --> 49:11.736
She's fucking dead!

49:12.663 --> 49:14.163
We found her all cut up.

49:14.163 --> 49:15.783
Her fucking tongue is gone.

49:15.783 --> 49:18.153
Ever since we did that goddam ritual!

49:18.153 --> 49:18.986
- Wait.

49:20.253 --> 49:21.086
Ritual?

49:22.263 --> 49:23.096
- Agatha.

49:24.441 --> 49:27.108
(ominous music)

49:35.103 --> 49:35.936
- I'm sorry?

49:38.253 --> 49:39.873
- We brought her back.

49:39.873 --> 49:42.153
I mean, that's the only
explanation, right?

49:42.153 --> 49:42.993
We asked her to come back,

49:42.993 --> 49:43.826
and she did.
- Lauren, stop.

49:43.826 --> 49:45.243
- How else do you explain it, Peter?

49:45.243 --> 49:46.743
- Even if she was real, why now?

49:46.743 --> 49:47.703
Why tonight of all nights?

49:47.703 --> 49:49.263
Why would she-
- It's like you said.

49:49.263 --> 49:50.563
She had something to heal.

49:54.963 --> 49:57.073
Just like she did 42 years ago.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.194
- What did you do?

50:02.194 --> 50:04.861
(ominous music)

50:34.743 --> 50:35.643
Jerry?

50:35.643 --> 50:36.843
- No.

50:36.843 --> 50:38.300
- What do we do?
- No.

50:38.300 --> 50:39.216
- Jerry.
- No.

50:40.132 --> 50:40.965
No, I can't.

50:40.965 --> 50:42.543
I can't let her get me again.

50:42.543 --> 50:44.636
- Jerry.
- I tried.

50:44.636 --> 50:46.036
I tried to forget. I tried.

50:46.036 --> 50:46.869
I fucking tried.

50:46.869 --> 50:47.702
I tried, I tried.

50:47.702 --> 50:48.633
- I know.
- I tried!

50:48.633 --> 50:49.466
- I did too.

50:49.466 --> 50:51.132
- I tried, I tried.
- I know. I know, Jerry.

50:51.132 --> 50:52.473
- Don't fucking touch me!

50:52.473 --> 50:53.523
- How do we stop her?

50:56.703 --> 50:57.536
- You don't.

50:59.002 --> 51:01.919
(car horn honking)

51:04.023 --> 51:04.856
- Hey!

51:04.856 --> 51:05.796
Hey!
- Hey, guy!

51:05.796 --> 51:07.524
- Help!
- Help!

51:07.524 --> 51:08.664
- [Dylan] Hey!

51:08.664 --> 51:09.497
Hey!

51:10.666 --> 51:12.752
Hey!
- Help, help!

51:12.752 --> 51:14.940
- Hey, it's Pizza Time!

51:14.940 --> 51:16.017
What's up?

51:16.017 --> 51:18.364
(group chattering)
- Keep the car running.

51:18.364 --> 51:19.197
Keep the car running.

51:19.197 --> 51:20.030
- You can just give me a 20.

51:20.030 --> 51:21.213
We'll be cool.
- We have a situation.

51:21.213 --> 51:22.623
People are dead, you fucking idiot!

51:22.623 --> 51:23.456
- Dylan, relax!
- Whoa!

51:23.456 --> 51:24.519
- Get out of the car!
- Back off my car,

51:24.519 --> 51:25.623
you asshole!
- You wanna be next?

51:25.623 --> 51:26.456
- Stop!

51:26.456 --> 51:27.343
Help!
- Open up, please!

51:27.343 --> 51:29.076
- Get out of the fucking car,

51:29.076 --> 51:30.633
you piece of shit!
- Bro, chill out!

51:30.633 --> 51:33.533
Dude, back off my poppa's wagon, man!

51:33.533 --> 51:36.822
(group yelling simultaneously)

51:36.822 --> 51:39.064
- The time's over, motherfucker!

51:39.064 --> 51:40.611
- Whoa, hey, hey!

51:40.611 --> 51:43.320
I am well within my rights
to deny you this pizza!

51:43.320 --> 51:46.483
(gun fires)

51:46.483 --> 51:47.933
- Get out of the car, please.

51:50.343 --> 51:52.173
- Whoa, dude.

51:52.173 --> 51:55.628
Like I said, it's only
$17.32, but if you want it-

51:55.628 --> 51:57.961
(gun fires)

51:58.893 --> 51:59.736
- Now!

52:03.903 --> 52:04.736
- Jerry.

52:04.736 --> 52:06.783
- I said don't fucking touch me.

52:06.783 --> 52:07.986
- Hey!
- Shut up.

52:15.933 --> 52:18.543
- Listen, dude, anywhere
you wanna go, man,

52:18.543 --> 52:20.144
I'll take you.
- Turn around.

52:20.144 --> 52:21.311
- I just, I...

52:22.593 --> 52:23.853
- Have you ever been here before?

52:23.853 --> 52:24.723
- No, no, man.

52:24.723 --> 52:26.923
- Have any of you ever
seen this man before?

52:29.223 --> 52:31.983
I asked you a fucking question!

52:31.983 --> 52:33.303
- No.

52:33.303 --> 52:36.033
- Listen, dude. I don't
care about any of this.

52:36.033 --> 52:37.206
I don't care, man.

52:38.133 --> 52:39.843
It's just, it's my dad's car, dude.

52:39.843 --> 52:41.163
- I'd really appreciate it

52:41.163 --> 52:42.813
if you'd shut your fucking mouth.

52:43.863 --> 52:45.123
- Okay.

52:45.123 --> 52:45.956
- Jerry.

52:45.956 --> 52:46.789
- [Jerry] Get in the back seat.

52:46.789 --> 52:49.936
- Whatever, man.
- Jerry.

52:49.936 --> 52:50.769
Jerry.

52:53.043 --> 52:54.963
You're gonna find somebody, right?

52:54.963 --> 52:56.813
You're gonna send someone to help us?

52:58.687 --> 53:00.926
- You know I can't bring
anyone else into this.

53:01.875 --> 53:04.458
(somber music)

53:07.053 --> 53:07.886
Sorry.

53:09.567 --> 53:12.234
(ominous music)

53:18.783 --> 53:23.286
It has to die.

53:27.053 --> 53:29.636
(upbeat music)

53:32.977 --> 53:34.441
- He understands how to talk to people-

53:34.441 --> 53:35.579
- He's so stupid.

53:35.579 --> 53:38.487
(gun fires)

53:38.487 --> 53:40.254
- Sounds like Mike snuck in
those fireworks after all.

53:40.254 --> 53:41.853
- (laughs) I hope Heather nails him

53:41.853 --> 53:43.711
before he gets any more off.

53:43.711 --> 53:45.296
(children giggling)

53:45.296 --> 53:46.129
- What was that?

53:46.129 --> 53:47.763
- What was what?

53:47.763 --> 53:48.636
- Seriously?

53:49.503 --> 53:51.003
- This isn't "The Burning," Ben.

53:51.003 --> 53:53.013
You've really got cool with
the Briarbrook boogieman stuff.

53:53.013 --> 53:53.846
- Ashley.

53:53.846 --> 53:56.103
(gun fires)

53:56.103 --> 53:57.396
- Okay, that one, I saw.

53:58.803 --> 53:59.916
- Holy shit.

54:01.983 --> 54:03.183
- What the hell is this?

54:05.038 --> 54:07.705
(ominous music)

54:11.583 --> 54:12.416
Martha?

54:13.413 --> 54:14.766
Martha, what are you doing?

54:19.555 --> 54:22.222
(ominous music)

54:23.343 --> 54:24.176
- Ash?

54:25.304 --> 54:26.970
- What?
- We gotta go. We gotta go.

54:26.970 --> 54:27.823
- I'm not just leaving them here.

54:27.823 --> 54:28.713
- We'll come back.

54:28.713 --> 54:30.063
We can't stay here and figure this out

54:30.063 --> 54:31.053
on our own.
- Watch me.

54:31.053 --> 54:33.491
Martha Roberts, you listen to me right-

54:33.491 --> 54:34.791
- We've gotta go. Come on!

54:36.122 --> 54:38.898
- [Children] Ex vitam immortalem.

54:38.898 --> 54:40.565
Ex vitam immortalem.

54:41.917 --> 54:43.584
Ex vitam immortalem.

54:44.643 --> 54:46.773
- Ashley, they did the
ritual again. All of them.

54:46.773 --> 54:49.653
- Yeah, but it's bullshit.
It's always bullshit.

54:49.653 --> 54:51.980
- Then how do you explain any of this?

54:51.980 --> 54:54.179
- [Children] Ex vitam immortalem.

54:54.179 --> 54:57.846
Ex vitam immortalem.
- Ben, it can't be real.

54:59.726 --> 55:01.253
Because if it's real...

55:03.225 --> 55:04.433
- [Children] Ex vitam immortalem.

55:04.433 --> 55:05.266
- Oh my god.

55:05.266 --> 55:07.415
- [Children] Ex vitam immortalem.

55:07.415 --> 55:09.214
Ex vitam immortalem.

55:09.214 --> 55:12.111
(ominous music)
Ex vitam immortalem.

55:12.111 --> 55:14.176
Ex vitam immortalem.

55:14.176 --> 55:15.993
Ex vitam immortalem.

55:15.993 --> 55:17.513
- What, Ash? What do you see?

55:21.218 --> 55:23.019
Jesus Christ, Ashley. What do you see?

55:23.019 --> 55:25.316
- [Children] Ex vitam immortalem.

55:25.316 --> 55:26.989
Ex vitam immortalem.

55:26.989 --> 55:29.656
(ominous music)

55:33.775 --> 55:34.958
- It's her.

55:34.958 --> 55:38.041
(children screaming)

55:39.259 --> 55:41.090
(ominous music)

55:41.090 --> 55:41.992
- [Ben] Ashley, come on!

55:41.992 --> 55:43.019
- Ben, wait!

55:43.019 --> 55:43.941
- Hurry, Ashley!

55:43.941 --> 55:45.704
(Ashley screams)

55:45.704 --> 55:48.320
(children screaming)

55:48.320 --> 55:52.172
(Ben screams)
(Ashley screams)

55:52.172 --> 55:53.601
No, no, no, no, no!

55:53.601 --> 55:54.709
(children screaming)

55:54.709 --> 55:56.196
Tommy, you freaking weirdo!

55:56.196 --> 55:57.580
You're why people hate redheads!

55:57.580 --> 55:59.245
(children screaming)
- Die! Die!

55:59.245 --> 56:00.854
- Martha, I thought that you
were gonna be on Broadway!

56:00.854 --> 56:03.753
(children screaming)

56:03.753 --> 56:06.336
(upbeat music)

56:19.949 --> 56:21.127
- Ben?
- Ben?

56:21.127 --> 56:22.388
- [Mike] Ben, what the fuck?

56:22.388 --> 56:23.726
- Where have you been?
- Where were you?

56:23.726 --> 56:25.124
- [Kid] I'm gonna get you!

56:25.124 --> 56:27.707
(kids yelling)

56:28.559 --> 56:30.986
(Heather screams)

56:30.986 --> 56:31.819
- [Mike] Let go!

56:31.819 --> 56:32.652
Let go!

56:32.652 --> 56:35.257
(Heather screams)
Get off her!

56:35.257 --> 56:37.924
(Dylan screams)

56:40.113 --> 56:41.068
- [Ben] They killed her!

56:41.068 --> 56:42.815
They killed Ashley!
- [Heather] What do you mean?

56:42.815 --> 56:44.623
- I don't know, they were,
like, possessed or something!

56:44.623 --> 56:46.424
- What the hell do we do?
- She saw her!

56:46.424 --> 56:47.257
Ashley, she-

56:47.257 --> 56:48.376
- Saw who?

56:48.376 --> 56:49.381
- Aga-
- Don't say her name!

56:49.381 --> 56:50.214
- [Ben] I was looking, too!

56:50.214 --> 56:51.171
- Ben!
- I couldn't see her,

56:51.171 --> 56:52.883
but Ashley-
- Ben!

56:52.883 --> 56:53.936
Did you do it?

56:53.936 --> 56:55.023
- Her eyes, she was there!

56:55.023 --> 56:57.633
- [Heather] The ritual,
did you say her name?

56:57.633 --> 56:59.043
- No, no, no, just Ashley!

56:59.043 --> 57:01.315
- They're not letting up, Mom!

57:01.315 --> 57:02.643
Mom, they're not gonna let up!

57:02.643 --> 57:03.586
- So let's fucking take 'em on!

57:03.586 --> 57:05.583
- Yeah, kill a dozen ten-year-olds, Dylan.

57:05.583 --> 57:06.813
Great fucking idea!

57:06.813 --> 57:08.163
- Fair game, bitch!

57:08.163 --> 57:09.333
- They're still kids.

57:09.333 --> 57:10.166
- So?

57:10.166 --> 57:11.943
- They're still in there, just like I was.

57:11.943 --> 57:12.776
- Great, Heather.

57:12.776 --> 57:15.543
So what does the bitch want,
huh? A virgin sacrifice?

57:15.543 --> 57:16.376
Hey, Ben. Come on.

57:16.376 --> 57:17.850
Time to step up-
- Fuck you, Dylan!

57:17.850 --> 57:19.863
- [Dylan] You could actually
be fucking helpful, come on.

57:19.863 --> 57:22.719
- Is this seriously happening right now?

57:22.719 --> 57:24.816
- Or maybe it's you.

57:26.853 --> 57:29.913
Unfinished business from 1945.

57:29.913 --> 57:32.673
- If she wanted to kill
me, she would have done it.

57:32.673 --> 57:33.693
I was eight years old.

57:33.693 --> 57:34.923
- Then what does she want?!

57:34.923 --> 57:35.756
- To live!

57:37.231 --> 57:38.523
(children yelling)

57:38.523 --> 57:41.748
Ex vitam immortalem.

57:41.748 --> 57:44.523
(ominous music)
(children yelling)

57:44.523 --> 57:45.516
Immortal life.

57:48.348 --> 57:50.596
She's not gonna stop until anyone

57:52.353 --> 57:55.233
who can send her back to Hell is dead.

57:55.233 --> 57:58.233
- Guys, we've really gotta
get rid of these fucking kids.

57:58.233 --> 57:59.673
- What if we make a run for it?

57:59.673 --> 58:01.293
Everyone just goes
straight for the entrance?

58:01.293 --> 58:03.423
- They're just gonna
follow us wherever we go.

58:03.423 --> 58:04.256
- So let them.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.923
I'll run out back,

58:07.923 --> 58:09.423
lead them around the building,

58:09.423 --> 58:10.683
down through the loading dock,

58:10.683 --> 58:11.783
and into the basement.

58:12.843 --> 58:14.946
- You just wanna let them in?
- It's a trap, Pete.

58:15.903 --> 58:17.583
We have to contain them.

58:17.583 --> 58:18.963
As soon as I come back upstairs,

58:18.963 --> 58:20.433
we can barricade them through this door.

58:20.433 --> 58:22.803
- Mike, you're not gonna be
able to get those doors open.

58:22.803 --> 58:23.733
Not with them on your tail.

58:23.733 --> 58:24.933
- You got a better idea?

58:26.033 --> 58:27.903
(children yelling)

58:27.903 --> 58:28.736
- I'll go too.

58:29.793 --> 58:31.803
Run around the other direction.

58:31.803 --> 58:33.753
Someone has to lock them in
once you're through anyway.

58:33.753 --> 58:34.593
- Peter.

58:34.593 --> 58:35.426
- He's right.

58:37.683 --> 58:38.883
- It's okay. I'll do it.

58:40.233 --> 58:41.066
- Let's go.

58:42.438 --> 58:44.433
(ominous music)

58:44.433 --> 58:45.266
- Mike.

58:46.192 --> 58:48.775
(kids yelling)

58:50.733 --> 58:51.566
Here.

58:53.656 --> 58:55.756
- I thought you said you-
- Just in case.

59:01.148 --> 59:02.153
- All right.

59:02.153 --> 59:04.863
On my count, as soon as I'm through,

59:04.863 --> 59:07.203
Lauren, slam it shut.

59:07.203 --> 59:09.426
When it's clear, Pete, you run for it.

59:10.503 --> 59:11.336
I'll go the long way,

59:11.336 --> 59:13.433
and I'll shout when I
come around the bend.

59:14.793 --> 59:15.933
If the doors aren't open yet-

59:15.933 --> 59:16.766
- They'll be open.

59:16.766 --> 59:19.266
- If they aren't, I'll run another lap.

59:20.343 --> 59:21.486
The mob can't split.

59:22.953 --> 59:24.453
We have to keep them together.

59:25.323 --> 59:26.703
One target.

59:26.703 --> 59:27.536
- Got it.

59:27.536 --> 59:28.846
- Got it.

59:28.846 --> 59:30.402
- All right.

59:30.402 --> 59:31.235
All right.

59:33.929 --> 59:38.929
(children yelling)
(ominous music)

59:47.465 --> 59:49.965
(tense music)

01:00:01.694 --> 01:00:04.611
(children yelling)

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:08.947
Hey!

01:00:08.947 --> 01:00:09.973
Hey!

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.653
Hey! Over here!

01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:16.004
(ominous music)
(children yelling)

01:00:16.004 --> 01:00:17.678
- All right, coast is clear.
- You sure?

01:00:17.678 --> 01:00:19.294
- Yep.

01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:21.136
- All right, screw it. Let's go.

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:26.503
(children yelling)

01:00:30.582 --> 01:00:31.985
- Shit!

01:00:31.985 --> 01:00:36.985
(children yelling)
(ominous music)

01:00:37.293 --> 01:00:38.523
- Come on, guys.

01:00:38.523 --> 01:00:40.611
Let's move these benches.
- [Dylan] Come on, hurry up!

01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:41.528
- I got it.

01:00:42.387 --> 01:00:45.304
(children yelling)

01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:50.607
(kid screams)

01:00:50.607 --> 01:00:53.370
(ominous music)

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:56.287
(children yelling)

01:00:57.509 --> 01:01:00.259
(fire crackling)

01:01:01.966 --> 01:01:03.504
(kids yelling)
- Peter!

01:01:03.504 --> 01:01:04.337
Doors!

01:01:05.171 --> 01:01:06.254
Now!

01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:07.764
(ominous music)

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.145
Focus!

01:01:09.145 --> 01:01:14.145
(ominous music)
(children yelling)

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:26.116
(ominous music)

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:29.033
(children yelling)

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:40.043
(ominous music)

01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:45.337
- [Tommy] Die!

01:01:45.337 --> 01:01:50.337
(ominous music)
(children yelling)

01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:52.434
- Hey, Mike!

01:01:52.434 --> 01:01:54.491
Where are you at?!

01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:57.158
(ominous music)

01:02:10.007 --> 01:02:12.674
(ominous music)

01:02:18.954 --> 01:02:20.899
- [Ghostly Voice] Peter.

01:02:20.899 --> 01:02:22.794
(ghostly voice laughing)

01:02:22.794 --> 01:02:24.836
(ominous music)

01:02:24.836 --> 01:02:26.793
- [Children] Briarbrook, brook, brook!

01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:28.843
Briarbrook, brook, brook!

01:02:28.843 --> 01:02:29.676
- Mike?!

01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:30.509
Whoa!

01:02:31.676 --> 01:02:33.498
Mike! Come on!
- Mike, come on!

01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:34.759
Come on!

01:02:34.759 --> 01:02:36.142
Give me your hand, you idiot!

01:02:36.142 --> 01:02:37.240
- Close the door!

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.509
(Mike screams)

01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:39.518
- Mike, come on!

01:02:39.518 --> 01:02:40.767
Please, you can do this, Mike!

01:02:40.767 --> 01:02:42.810
- [Dylan] Mike, throw an elbow, goddam it!

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.588
- Do something!
- Kick 'em, Mike!

01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:47.341
(Lauren screams)

01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:48.174
- Come on!
- Fuck, he's not gonna

01:02:48.174 --> 01:02:49.484
make it.
- Help him!

01:02:49.484 --> 01:02:50.424
Mike, hurry!

01:02:50.424 --> 01:02:52.007
Come on, hurry up! Let's go!

01:02:52.007 --> 01:02:54.761
- He's not gonna make it!

01:02:54.761 --> 01:02:56.608
- Dylan, what the fuck is wrong you?!

01:02:56.608 --> 01:02:59.191
What the fuck?!
- You're welcome!

01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:00.977
- [Lauren] Michael!

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:04.737
(Mike screaming)
- Briarbrook, brook, brook!

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:06.377
Briarbrook, brook, brook!

01:03:06.377 --> 01:03:09.413
Briarbrook, Briarbrook!
(Mike screams)

01:03:09.413 --> 01:03:10.302
- Stop it!

01:03:10.302 --> 01:03:12.163
(group yelling simultaneously)

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.365
- What the fuck it wrong with you?!

01:03:14.365 --> 01:03:16.584
Stop it, you idiot!

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.130
Move the benches!

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:19.930
Move the fucking benches!

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.789
(banging on door)

01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:25.167
- Who the fuck is that?

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.182
- Peter.

01:03:26.182 --> 01:03:27.253
- Lauren, she touched me!

01:03:27.253 --> 01:03:28.438
She's real, Lauren!

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.200
(Peter screams)

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.200
(ominous music)
(Peter screams)

01:03:36.203 --> 01:03:38.931
(gun fires)

01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:42.195
(tense music)

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:44.528
(gun fires)

01:03:45.594 --> 01:03:48.047
(gun fires)

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:50.714
(ominous music)

01:04:02.827 --> 01:04:04.374
- Dear, God.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:05.207
- Dad!

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:08.634
She's here.

01:04:08.634 --> 01:04:09.723
It's her. She's back.

01:04:09.723 --> 01:04:11.234
- How many are dead?
- Five.

01:04:11.234 --> 01:04:12.543
- Jesus Christ.

01:04:12.543 --> 01:04:13.533
- They did the ritual.

01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:15.303
- I know. Shawn told me.

01:04:15.303 --> 01:04:18.183
Lauren! Get back in the mess hall now.

01:04:18.183 --> 01:04:19.563
Now!

01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:20.826
I need to talk to Peter.

01:04:23.206 --> 01:04:24.743
- I saw her.

01:04:24.743 --> 01:04:26.853
- Do you have any idea what you've done?

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:27.686
- [Peter] Grandpa-

01:04:27.686 --> 01:04:28.930
- Do you have the faintest
idea what you've done?

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:31.206
- I think I get the fucking picture!

01:04:33.513 --> 01:04:35.313
Why didn't you tell me she was real?

01:04:38.133 --> 01:04:40.263
A question for all of you, actually.

01:04:40.263 --> 01:04:43.263
Why the hell wasn't I informed
about this big family secret?

01:04:46.893 --> 01:04:48.003
You clearly knew.

01:04:48.003 --> 01:04:50.373
- Not that she could come back.

01:04:50.373 --> 01:04:51.623
- But you knew the story.

01:04:52.773 --> 01:04:54.633
You knew Mom and Grandpa
were a part of it.

01:04:54.633 --> 01:04:56.043
- [Shawn] Yes.

01:04:56.043 --> 01:04:57.633
- Then why the fuck didn't you tell me,

01:04:57.633 --> 01:04:59.163
Shawn?!
- I did, Pete!

01:04:59.163 --> 01:05:00.723
Let it die! Remember?

01:05:00.723 --> 01:05:01.718
- That's horseshit, and you know it.

01:05:01.718 --> 01:05:03.213
- Or maybe you're just
not mentally equipped

01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:04.053
to handle these things.

01:05:04.053 --> 01:05:04.956
- Just stop.

01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:07.903
I should have said something.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:11.833
I just didn't think you were ready.

01:05:14.792 --> 01:05:16.203
- Mom.

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:17.403
What, do you think I would
have been screwing around

01:05:17.403 --> 01:05:18.903
like this if I knew the truth?

01:05:22.923 --> 01:05:23.756
They're dead.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.973
They're dead, and it's my fault.

01:05:26.973 --> 01:05:28.266
- It's not your fault.

01:05:30.513 --> 01:05:32.113
I thought it was safer this way.

01:05:36.453 --> 01:05:37.753
- I don't know what to do.

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:40.943
What do we do, Mom?

01:05:47.523 --> 01:05:48.356
- Dad?

01:05:53.793 --> 01:05:55.793
- I never thought it would come to this.

01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:02.474
(fire crackling)

01:06:05.673 --> 01:06:07.296
It was our first summer here.

01:06:11.973 --> 01:06:13.146
Evelyn was ill.

01:06:15.003 --> 01:06:16.356
Nobody knew what it was.

01:06:17.523 --> 01:06:19.473
Doctor after doctor,

01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:22.926
one just as helpless as the next.

01:06:24.693 --> 01:06:28.386
And then one day, she came.

01:06:31.503 --> 01:06:35.316
She answered an ad we had put
in the paper for a camp nurse.

01:06:36.963 --> 01:06:39.543
When she saw how Evelyn was suffering,

01:06:39.543 --> 01:06:42.756
she promised she would do
everything that she could.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.666
Everything.

01:06:45.891 --> 01:06:47.403
(woman sobs)

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:48.846
But your mother kept fading.

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:51.486
She withered,

01:06:52.953 --> 01:06:57.953
and little by little, her
face was no longer hers.

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:06.876
And as I lost my grip on your mother,

01:07:08.883 --> 01:07:10.986
I began to lose my grip on myself.

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:17.226
In a moment of unspeakable weakness,

01:07:21.363 --> 01:07:22.540
Agatha and I...

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:27.579
(ominous music)
(woman panting)

01:07:27.579 --> 01:07:30.329
(flames roaring)

01:07:31.287 --> 01:07:33.870
(somber music)

01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:42.113
Evelyn passed just hours
after that, at dawn.

01:07:42.283 --> 01:07:44.913
(woman coughing)

01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:47.523
And that's when I started to realize

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:52.523
that those treatments,
they weren't treatments.

01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:55.596
It wasn't medicine.

01:07:56.716 --> 01:07:59.549
(Evelyn coughing)

01:08:01.113 --> 01:08:03.573
I threw her out.
(Agatha laughs)

01:08:03.573 --> 01:08:05.020
I banished her!

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.263
(somber music)

01:08:19.973 --> 01:08:21.996
In the weeks and months that followed,

01:08:25.113 --> 01:08:26.856
I thought the healing would begin.

01:08:28.593 --> 01:08:29.796
But she never left.

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:34.292
She took shelter in the woods,

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:36.893
just outside the boundaries of Briarbrook.

01:08:43.473 --> 01:08:46.626
She would lure the children
from their bunks by night,

01:08:48.393 --> 01:08:52.983
healing them, collecting
their blood in jars

01:08:52.983 --> 01:08:55.236
that she hung from the trees.

01:08:57.371 --> 01:08:59.953
(somber music)

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:15.743
When I found you there that
night, out there in the woods,

01:09:20.193 --> 01:09:21.185
I lost it.

01:09:22.233 --> 01:09:23.886
I chased her down.

01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:28.353
I hunted her, because I was
desperate to end this thing

01:09:28.353 --> 01:09:29.286
once and for all.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.856
End her. And I did.

01:09:33.816 --> 01:09:36.316
(tense music)

01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:48.633
When I looked down at her dying,

01:09:48.633 --> 01:09:52.836
I saw she had your mother's ring,

01:09:53.883 --> 01:09:55.483
her wedding ring, on her finger.

01:09:58.983 --> 01:10:00.936
She'd stolen it from the corpse.

01:10:04.172 --> 01:10:08.220
It was one final, sick act of duplicity.

01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:18.176
I buried her.

01:10:19.323 --> 01:10:22.803
I buried her at the lowest
point in Briarbrook,

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:25.326
just as close to Hell as I could.

01:10:26.913 --> 01:10:29.563
I thought, "Well, that will
be the end of the story."

01:10:32.883 --> 01:10:33.933
Of course, it wasn't.

01:10:36.873 --> 01:10:37.746
I let her in.

01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:43.371
- And I brought her back.

01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:49.986
- Dad, how could you?

01:10:55.413 --> 01:10:56.496
- Please, forgive me.

01:10:57.727 --> 01:11:00.310
(somber music)

01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:03.026
- Guys?

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:07.563
Where are Ben and Dylan?

01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:12.653
(Ben screams)

01:11:12.653 --> 01:11:15.320
(ominous music)

01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:21.964
- [Ben] Dylan! Stop, please!

01:11:21.964 --> 01:11:23.531
Stop!

01:11:23.531 --> 01:11:25.339
- I said shut up!

01:11:25.339 --> 01:11:26.706
Shut up!

01:11:26.706 --> 01:11:29.007
She's gonna hear you.

01:11:29.007 --> 01:11:31.590
(Ben whimpers)

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:35.533
- Please, Dylan.

01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:37.224
- Benny boy, hey.

01:11:37.224 --> 01:11:40.293
Hey, this is nothing personal, okay?

01:11:40.293 --> 01:11:41.523
I've just got big plans,

01:11:41.523 --> 01:11:43.653
and they don't include dying
in these fucking woods tonight!

01:11:43.653 --> 01:11:44.696
- I don't understand.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.733
- I've seen a lot of horror
flicks in my day, man.

01:11:47.733 --> 01:11:48.873
But this bitch?

01:11:48.873 --> 01:11:51.775
This bitch? This shit's
next fucking level.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:52.683
- Please, please, Dylan.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.393
Don't, Dylan.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:55.343
We need each other.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.023
- Yeah.

01:11:58.023 --> 01:11:58.856
Yeah, I do need you.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:11:59.689
I need you right here.

01:11:59.689 --> 01:12:01.089
- Why are you doing this?

01:12:01.089 --> 01:12:03.255
- I told you to be quiet!

01:12:03.255 --> 01:12:04.714
I told you to be quiet!

01:12:04.714 --> 01:12:06.006
I told you to be quiet.

01:12:06.006 --> 01:12:08.256
(Ben sobs)

01:12:09.873 --> 01:12:10.863
Say her name.

01:12:12.763 --> 01:12:14.010
- What?

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.260
- Say her name.

01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:17.740
- I'm not gonna.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.573
I'm not gonna.

01:12:18.573 --> 01:12:20.046
(Ben screams)

01:12:20.046 --> 01:12:20.879
- Say it!

01:12:22.393 --> 01:12:23.226
Say it!

01:12:24.904 --> 01:12:25.737
Say it!

01:12:27.266 --> 01:12:29.516
(Ben sobs)

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:31.506
- Agatha.

01:12:31.506 --> 01:12:33.055
- Louder!

01:12:33.055 --> 01:12:34.515
- Agatha!
- Louder!

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:35.782
- Agatha!

01:12:35.782 --> 01:12:38.032
(Ben sobs)

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:52.332
- There.

01:12:56.719 --> 01:12:59.719
That wasn't so fucking hard, was it?

01:13:02.389 --> 01:13:04.889
(Ben screams)

01:13:06.519 --> 01:13:09.019
(both scream)

01:13:15.937 --> 01:13:18.437
(Ben screams)

01:13:21.896 --> 01:13:23.667
He's all yours!

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:26.917
(Ben screams and sobs)

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:34.920
(fire crackling)

01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:42.246
(gentle somber music)

01:14:10.803 --> 01:14:12.103
- [Lauren] Mr. McCalister?

01:14:16.173 --> 01:14:20.283
- Lauren, if you don't start
calling me Gilbert now,

01:14:20.283 --> 01:14:22.146
you may not get another chance.

01:14:25.053 --> 01:14:25.886
- Gilbert.

01:14:29.283 --> 01:14:31.803
We decided not to go look for them.

01:14:31.803 --> 01:14:34.323
Splitting up didn't really
go well for us last time, so-

01:14:34.323 --> 01:14:35.553
- Yeah.

01:14:35.553 --> 01:14:36.816
Well, that seems wise.

01:14:42.573 --> 01:14:46.566
You, um, you heard what I said in there.

01:14:50.733 --> 01:14:52.056
I am so sorry.

01:14:55.503 --> 01:14:56.336
- We know.

01:15:04.203 --> 01:15:05.076
- How's he doing?

01:15:07.323 --> 01:15:08.156
- The same.

01:15:12.153 --> 01:15:13.206
He made a mistake.

01:15:14.433 --> 01:15:15.266
We all did.

01:15:19.563 --> 01:15:20.813
- He's lucky to have you.

01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:27.283
Let's try not to die tonight.

01:15:31.719 --> 01:15:34.386
(ominous music)

01:15:39.556 --> 01:15:42.056
(tense music)

01:15:49.448 --> 01:15:51.417
(car putters)

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.250
- Come on!

01:15:53.438 --> 01:15:54.439
Come on!

01:15:54.439 --> 01:15:55.631
Fuck!

01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.565
Come on, you motherfucker!

01:15:57.565 --> 01:15:58.398
God!

01:16:02.344 --> 01:16:03.594
What the fuck?!

01:16:06.672 --> 01:16:09.172
(tense music)

01:16:16.132 --> 01:16:18.799
(ominous music)

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:21.103
Dennis?

01:16:28.228 --> 01:16:29.061
Dennis?

01:16:31.323 --> 01:16:32.613
You little fucking shit!

01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:38.680
(Dylan screams)

01:16:43.276 --> 01:16:44.238
Help me!

01:16:44.238 --> 01:16:46.156
Dennis, put it out!

01:16:46.156 --> 01:16:47.034
- Oh my god!

01:16:47.034 --> 01:16:48.681
- Oh, shit!

01:16:48.681 --> 01:16:49.848
- God damn it!

01:16:51.958 --> 01:16:53.208
(Dennis laughs)

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.375
Get back here!

01:16:55.415 --> 01:16:57.715
I'll kill you, you little shit!

01:16:57.715 --> 01:16:59.548
I'll fucking kill you!

01:17:01.095 --> 01:17:02.095
God damn it!

01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:05.858
Help me!

01:17:21.521 --> 01:17:24.188
(Dylan choking)

01:17:29.618 --> 01:17:32.374
(ominous music)

01:17:32.374 --> 01:17:35.207
(Dylan screaming)

01:17:41.855 --> 01:17:44.438
(Dylan coughs)

01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:46.338
Kill me.

01:17:49.214 --> 01:17:50.047
- What?

01:17:52.475 --> 01:17:53.975
- Kill me. Please.

01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:56.809
Please!

01:17:57.957 --> 01:17:59.124
- Where's Ben?

01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:04.536
- I saved you.

01:18:08.073 --> 01:18:09.336
I saved all of you!

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:14.586
- Dylan, where is my brother?

01:18:18.544 --> 01:18:21.211
(ominous music)

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.332
(Dylan moans)

01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:36.082
(Dylan chuckles)

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:41.375
(Dylan laughs maniacally)

01:18:48.899 --> 01:18:49.732
- Oh!
- Lauren!

01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:51.572
- Lauren!
- Oh my god.

01:18:51.572 --> 01:18:56.572
(fire extinguisher clanging)
(Lauren grunting)

01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:00.236
- What now?

01:19:02.073 --> 01:19:05.013
- I'm telling you, we hunt the hag.

01:19:05.013 --> 01:19:06.213
It's five versus one.

01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:09.153
- Outnumbering her hasn't really
done us much good tonight.

01:19:09.153 --> 01:19:10.806
- She touched Peter, right?

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.596
So she's corporeal now.

01:19:14.853 --> 01:19:15.933
- What does that mean?

01:19:15.933 --> 01:19:17.823
- That means, she's flesh and blood.

01:19:17.823 --> 01:19:19.023
- Whatever's left of it.

01:19:20.463 --> 01:19:22.063
- Then why couldn't Ben see her?

01:19:24.365 --> 01:19:25.665
- He didn't do the ritual.

01:19:26.793 --> 01:19:27.626
Right?

01:19:29.013 --> 01:19:29.846
Maybe that's it.

01:19:29.846 --> 01:19:32.373
Maybe you can only see her,
interact with her, if you do.

01:19:33.663 --> 01:19:35.883
- But Mr. McCalister, you
tried to shoot her just now.

01:19:35.883 --> 01:19:36.716
You didn't-

01:19:36.716 --> 01:19:39.093
- No, I was trying to scare the boy.

01:19:39.093 --> 01:19:40.656
I didn't see anybody else.

01:19:44.553 --> 01:19:46.353
- So, why don't we just leave?

01:19:46.353 --> 01:19:47.186
- No.

01:19:47.186 --> 01:19:49.923
It's a seven-mile hike
with no street lights.

01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:52.353
She'd pick us off one by one in the dark.

01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:54.813
No, no, no, this story ends here,

01:19:54.813 --> 01:19:56.526
right here, tonight.

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:01.976
- How?

01:20:03.894 --> 01:20:06.394
(tense music)

01:20:09.063 --> 01:20:09.896
- The ring.

01:20:13.233 --> 01:20:14.783
You said she had it that night.

01:20:15.963 --> 01:20:18.783
I don't know, maybe she
cursed it. Maybe she needs it.

01:20:18.783 --> 01:20:20.373
- It's possible.

01:20:20.373 --> 01:20:22.743
- What do you always say
about it, Mr. McCalister?

01:20:22.743 --> 01:20:24.793
The seed from which Briarbrook took root?

01:20:28.593 --> 01:20:29.466
- Devotion.

01:20:31.053 --> 01:20:31.956
Loyalty.

01:20:35.013 --> 01:20:35.846
- Eternity.

01:20:37.413 --> 01:20:40.416
She stole it from Evelyn,
and I stole it back from her.

01:20:41.523 --> 01:20:43.293
- If we can lure her out with it-

01:20:43.293 --> 01:20:44.343
- That's risky.

01:20:44.343 --> 01:20:46.616
- If I'm right, she'll be
coming for it either way.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.996
- It's just you and me right now, Lauren.

01:20:52.443 --> 01:20:53.493
Mom didn't prick her fingers.

01:20:53.493 --> 01:20:54.396
Same with Shawn.

01:20:55.263 --> 01:20:56.226
Same with Grandpa.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:02.676
She's not coming for
them, she's coming for us.

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.363
(somber music)

01:21:10.443 --> 01:21:11.443
- Unless

01:21:15.843 --> 01:21:16.806
you weren't alone.

01:21:19.859 --> 01:21:22.442
(somber music)

01:21:25.099 --> 01:21:26.043
- Mom, no.

01:21:26.043 --> 01:21:27.483
- It's bold.

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:28.683
- It could work.

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:29.516
- Mom, you can't.

01:21:29.516 --> 01:21:30.483
Please, please don't do this.

01:21:30.483 --> 01:21:32.020
Please, Mom, you can't.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.366
- Knapsack, Peter.

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.653
(somber music)

01:21:37.653 --> 01:21:38.486
Peter.

01:21:39.517 --> 01:21:42.100
(somber music)

01:21:52.378 --> 01:21:53.463
- Heather.

01:21:53.463 --> 01:21:54.613
- It's decided, Lauren.

01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:57.456
- But what if-
- No ifs.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:21:59.496
We're family here.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:01.316
- All of us.

01:22:02.811 --> 01:22:05.394
(somber music)

01:22:08.193 --> 01:22:09.026
- Yeah?

01:22:10.896 --> 01:22:13.479
(somber music)

01:22:18.471 --> 01:22:19.304
- Agatha.

01:22:22.476 --> 01:22:23.309
- Agatha.

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:26.523
- Agatha.

01:22:34.739 --> 01:22:35.906
I have a date.

01:22:40.944 --> 01:22:43.944
(crickets chirping)

01:22:48.945 --> 01:22:50.196
- [Heather] Are you sure this is the spot?

01:22:50.196 --> 01:22:51.933
- [Gilbert] It's the best line of sight.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.973
- [Heather] You could be
exposed in every direction.

01:22:53.973 --> 01:22:55.893
- [Gilbert] I need her to
think that I'm vulnerable.

01:22:55.893 --> 01:22:58.746
- Dad, you don't have to do this.

01:23:02.358 --> 01:23:03.276
- Oh, Jesus.

01:23:05.343 --> 01:23:06.246
Yes, I do.

01:23:11.673 --> 01:23:12.506
- All right.

01:23:13.383 --> 01:23:14.763
Another hundred yards past maintenance,

01:23:14.763 --> 01:23:16.383
then we form the perimeter.

01:23:16.383 --> 01:23:17.643
- Got it.

01:23:17.643 --> 01:23:19.946
- Make sure you stay close
enough so they can see us.

01:23:24.063 --> 01:23:27.576
- Lauren, if we, uh,

01:23:30.063 --> 01:23:30.903
if we don't make it tonight,

01:23:30.903 --> 01:23:31.806
I want you to know that-

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.056
- [Shawn] Pete.

01:23:41.373 --> 01:23:42.726
I closed that up earlier.

01:23:44.523 --> 01:23:45.356
You saw me.

01:23:47.827 --> 01:23:50.494
(ominous music)

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:57.160
(gun fires)

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:57.993
- Agatha!

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:02.435
(ominous music)

01:24:08.205 --> 01:24:10.044
- She's been here.

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.794
- [Lauren] Oh my god.

01:24:14.367 --> 01:24:16.214
- [Ben] Help!

01:24:16.214 --> 01:24:18.955
Somebody help me, please!

01:24:18.955 --> 01:24:19.788
Oh my god!

01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:23.621
(Ben screams)

01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:24.806
- Ben?

01:24:24.806 --> 01:24:26.163
- Didn't Dylan say he was dead?

01:24:26.163 --> 01:24:28.736
- Dylan said he saved us.
- It could be a trick.

01:24:28.736 --> 01:24:31.533
I mean, can't witches do
that, like, steal your voice?

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:32.366
- He's right.

01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:35.081
Maybe it's bait.

01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:35.978
- [Ben] Lauren!

01:24:35.978 --> 01:24:37.093
Peter! Can you hear me?

01:24:37.093 --> 01:24:38.176
- But maybe it's not.

01:24:38.176 --> 01:24:39.259
(Ben screams)

01:24:39.259 --> 01:24:40.841
- [Ben] Help me, please!

01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:43.347
Somebody help me! Right here!

01:24:43.347 --> 01:24:44.503
She's right in front of me!

01:24:44.503 --> 01:24:45.529
Guys!

01:24:45.529 --> 01:24:48.029
(Ben screams)

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:52.960
- Peter!
- Pete!

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.867
(tense music)

01:24:55.867 --> 01:24:57.333
- It was coming from over here.

01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.500
- [Ben] Peter!

01:25:00.038 --> 01:25:01.520
Help!

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.278
(ominous music)

01:25:03.278 --> 01:25:04.737
- [Lauren] Careful!

01:25:04.737 --> 01:25:06.095
- [Shawn] Pete!

01:25:06.095 --> 01:25:07.038
- [Ben] Help me!

01:25:07.038 --> 01:25:07.871
- Ben!

01:25:07.871 --> 01:25:09.802
- Peter, save me!
- Peter!

01:25:09.802 --> 01:25:10.635
- Pete!

01:25:10.635 --> 01:25:12.745
- I'm around the corner!
- Slow down!

01:25:12.745 --> 01:25:14.012
- [Ben] I'm by the tree!

01:25:14.012 --> 01:25:15.069
Come closer!

01:25:15.069 --> 01:25:16.701
- I see you!
- Peter, stop it!

01:25:16.701 --> 01:25:18.133
- [Ben] I'm right here!

01:25:18.133 --> 01:25:20.151
(Agatha chuckles)
- Stop!

01:25:20.151 --> 01:25:21.579
(Lauren screams)

01:25:21.579 --> 01:25:25.162
(Agatha laughs maniacally)

01:25:33.206 --> 01:25:35.873
(Peter gasping)

01:25:46.973 --> 01:25:49.723
(Peter gurgling)

01:25:54.396 --> 01:25:56.979
(somber music)

01:25:59.932 --> 01:26:02.682
(Shawn sniffles)

01:26:03.773 --> 01:26:06.356
(somber music)

01:26:20.514 --> 01:26:23.181
(Peter gasping)

01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:27.228
(Peter sobs)

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.467
- It's okay, bro.

01:26:34.036 --> 01:26:34.953
We're good.

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:39.441
(Peter gasps)

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.003
(somber music)

01:27:31.636 --> 01:27:34.303
(ominous music)

01:27:56.935 --> 01:27:57.852
- Anything?

01:27:58.887 --> 01:28:00.933
- [Heather] Nothing. You?

01:28:00.933 --> 01:28:01.766
- Not yet.

01:28:03.693 --> 01:28:06.033
Hey, weren't the kids supposed
to make that bird call

01:28:06.033 --> 01:28:08.283
so we'd know they were close?

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:09.116
Heather?

01:28:10.863 --> 01:28:11.878
Heather?

01:28:11.878 --> 01:28:13.689
(ominous music)
No!

01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:14.522
No!

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.189
(Agatha laughs)

01:28:19.696 --> 01:28:21.723
All right. You win.

01:28:21.723 --> 01:28:22.863
We're good. Let her go.

01:28:22.863 --> 01:28:24.243
No, let her go. Let her go.

01:28:24.243 --> 01:28:25.806
Look at me. Look right here.

01:28:26.673 --> 01:28:27.589
Look at me.

01:28:27.589 --> 01:28:28.547
(Agatha laughs)
Let her go.

01:28:28.547 --> 01:28:30.149
No, let her go.

01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:33.456
Okay. This is what you want, isn't it?

01:28:36.003 --> 01:28:37.863
This is what you want.

01:28:37.863 --> 01:28:38.696
Right?

01:28:40.353 --> 01:28:41.466
I'm right about this.

01:28:42.843 --> 01:28:44.826
Look, we can work this out.

01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:47.913
There.

01:28:47.913 --> 01:28:48.746
See?

01:28:52.272 --> 01:28:53.674
I can see you're angry.

01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:55.026
- Dad, don't do it.

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.513
- No, I made this mistake.

01:28:57.513 --> 01:28:58.386
I have to fix it.

01:29:00.513 --> 01:29:04.709
Agatha, give me your hand.

01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:06.360
Give me your hand.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.193
Please.

01:29:10.289 --> 01:29:11.122
Come on.

01:29:12.095 --> 01:29:13.473
Come on.

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:14.473
There we go.

01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:26.930
(Agatha chuckles)

01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:29.522
Gotcha!

01:29:29.522 --> 01:29:32.272
(Agatha screams)

01:29:34.254 --> 01:29:36.986
(Agatha laughs)

01:29:36.986 --> 01:29:37.945
- Dad!

01:29:37.945 --> 01:29:40.295
(Gilbert screams)

01:29:40.295 --> 01:29:42.962
(ominous music)

01:29:47.027 --> 01:29:48.623
- Bury me at Briarbrook.

01:29:48.623 --> 01:29:52.051
(shotgun fires)
- No!

01:29:52.051 --> 01:29:54.718
(ominous music)

01:29:56.081 --> 01:29:58.831
(Agatha screams)

01:29:59.723 --> 01:30:02.473
(Agatha screams)

01:30:13.368 --> 01:30:16.035
(Agatha laughs)

01:30:17.295 --> 01:30:20.013
- Bring our friends back. All of them.

01:30:20.013 --> 01:30:21.333
Do a hex, a ritual, whatever.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:22.390
Just bring them back.

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:25.223
(Agatha laughing)

01:30:48.161 --> 01:30:50.744
(Agatha gasps)

01:31:02.823 --> 01:31:04.273
- What do we do with her now?

01:31:06.797 --> 01:31:08.463
- Tie her to some rocks.

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:09.563
Throw her in the lake.

01:31:11.163 --> 01:31:12.903
- We've gotta chop her up first.

01:31:12.903 --> 01:31:14.223
We can't chance her popping up next summer

01:31:14.223 --> 01:31:16.073
like that kid at the end of "Friday."

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:29.049
- Where's Peter?

01:31:32.623 --> 01:31:35.623
(soft somber music)

01:33:57.574 --> 01:33:58.407
- Mom.

01:34:00.376 --> 01:34:02.076
We need to get you some help.

01:34:04.863 --> 01:34:05.903
- Excuse me.

01:34:05.903 --> 01:34:07.173
- Oh my god, Ben.

01:34:07.173 --> 01:34:08.006
- Lauren.

01:34:09.603 --> 01:34:11.373
- We got a call from
this young man over here

01:34:11.373 --> 01:34:13.503
about a, uh...

01:34:13.503 --> 01:34:16.803
What'd you say? A homeless
woman on the property?

01:34:16.803 --> 01:34:18.903
An Alice Cooper lookalike?

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.103
A wet gremlin?
- Witch.

01:34:20.103 --> 01:34:21.569
I said witch.

01:34:21.569 --> 01:34:22.473
- I thought the phones were-

01:34:22.473 --> 01:34:23.306
- I fixed the wiring.

01:34:23.306 --> 01:34:25.926
- Okay, does anyone
need medical attention?

01:34:32.403 --> 01:34:34.413
Right. I'll radio.

01:34:34.413 --> 01:34:37.473
Oh, also, we had an
officer drop by last night.

01:34:37.473 --> 01:34:38.913
He should have resolved everything,

01:34:38.913 --> 01:34:40.776
but his car's still out front.

01:34:41.853 --> 01:34:43.873
Did he end up partying
with you guys, or...

01:34:54.658 --> 01:34:55.491
Oh, god.

01:35:01.683 --> 01:35:03.366
What the hell happened here?

01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:07.487
