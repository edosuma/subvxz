01:55.781 --> 01:57.880
- Are you having fun?
- Oh.

01:57.882 --> 01:59.249
Great time.

01:59.251 --> 02:01.985
- Thanks, babe.
- I'm glad.

02:01.987 --> 02:03.656
We're gonna go outside
and have a smoke.

02:04.956 --> 02:07.126
I'll call you for cake.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.350
What's going on?

02:32.818 --> 02:35.452
There is a piece missing
from the plate.

02:35.454 --> 02:38.088
I don't want anyone
to step on it.

02:38.090 --> 02:40.656
Come on, Agnes.
Come on, stand up.

02:40.658 --> 02:42.292
Not during the party.

02:42.294 --> 02:43.660
Come on.

02:43.662 --> 02:45.061
Not tonight.

02:45.063 --> 02:46.865
You're so cute.

One. Now.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.791
Lou.

05:27.793 --> 05:29.159
Honey.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.827
Louie.

05:30.829 --> 05:32.094
Huh?

05:32.096 --> 05:34.296
Time to get up.

05:34.298 --> 05:35.664
What?

05:35.666 --> 05:37.099
Time to get up.

05:37.101 --> 05:39.072
Five more minutes.

05:40.372 --> 05:43.707
Five more minutes.

05:43.709 --> 05:46.812
- Please.
- Please.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.793
Five more minutes.

06:03.161 --> 06:06.164
Ten more minutes, Mom.
I swear.

06:11.002 --> 06:12.435
All right, Mom,
everything's set up.

06:12.437 --> 06:13.937
What kind of apps
do you think you want?

06:13.939 --> 06:15.406
- Apps? I don't want apps.
- Hey, which, uh...

06:15.408 --> 06:16.673
which grit did you use
on your final sanding?

06:16.675 --> 06:18.308
I don't want that phone.
You take it.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.509
- Mine's perfectly fine.
- You're seriously quizzing me

06:19.511 --> 06:20.510
- over breakfast?
- It's not a quiz.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.911
What about The Weather Channel?

06:21.913 --> 06:23.781
I just saw you using
1,200 the other day,

06:23.783 --> 06:25.382
- and that's never gonna work.
- I have a radio and a window.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.817
- I know when it's gonna rain.
- Look, Dad, I don't want

06:26.819 --> 06:28.551
to talk about this at home.
I need a break.

06:28.553 --> 06:29.820
Okay, well, you'll get a break
once you get it all right.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.055
All right. Uh, well,
I put my number

06:31.057 --> 06:32.389
and put Ziggy's
and Dad's on speed dial.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.824
Whose else
do you think you want?

06:33.826 --> 06:35.190
Do you need any help
with breakfast, Mom?

06:35.192 --> 06:36.327
- No, sweetie.
- You want Ezster

06:36.329 --> 06:38.027
and the church ladies or what?

06:38.029 --> 06:39.562
Okay, fine, so what,
I should've used the 400?

06:39.564 --> 06:40.998
I don't know why
I just wouldn't call them

06:41.000 --> 06:42.365
- on the home phone.
- That or the six.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.899
Can someone please explain
to my mother

06:43.901 --> 06:45.235
why she has to stop living
in the 20th century?

06:45.237 --> 06:47.170
You even gonna use it, Mom?

06:47.172 --> 06:49.673
I guess I might use it
like my old phone.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.173
- Thank you.
- For emergencies.

06:51.175 --> 06:53.409
Mom, look.

06:53.411 --> 06:55.144
Just try it.
You can Google something.

06:55.146 --> 06:57.714
You can Google recipes
or Bible study or whatever.

06:57.716 --> 07:00.183
Literally everything in the
world is on this one device.

07:00.185 --> 07:01.618
- Look.
- No. No.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.353
Just type it into here.

07:03.355 --> 07:06.923
It's like carrying
a little robot in your purse.

07:06.925 --> 07:09.392
Or a little alien robot friend.

07:09.394 --> 07:11.195
I don't need it.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.128
Clearly,
it doesn't need you, either.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.764
Hey.

07:14.766 --> 07:16.065
Let's say grace.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.235
Ziggy.

08:09.954 --> 08:12.791
Montreal.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.160
Oh.

09:24.162 --> 09:26.229
Sorry. I'm sorry.

09:26.231 --> 09:28.701
I know. Sorry.

09:35.006 --> 09:36.575
There you go.

10:24.456 --> 10:26.658
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.393
No, don't.

10:30.395 --> 10:31.929
Mom, it's like
a thousand pieces.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.229
Oh, it didn't
take me very long.

10:34.231 --> 10:35.598
What's going on?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.367
Nothing.
Mom just did a puzzle.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.302
Dinner is almost ready.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.504
Hey, aren't you gonna change?

10:41.506 --> 10:43.305
Mom asked me to set the table.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.574
In those filthy clothes?
Come on.

10:44.576 --> 10:45.677
It's okay. I'll do it.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.553
Mmm.

10:57.322 --> 11:00.493
- The chicken is stuffed with garlic.
- Mom, Nicki.

11:02.293 --> 11:05.195
I thought you just
didn't eat red meat.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.930
I'm vegan.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.565
We, uh... we went through this
already, Mom.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.002
So you never, ever eat chicken?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.470
She's, like... she's
hoping you're gonna forget.

11:14.472 --> 11:16.172
It's so embarrassing.

11:16.174 --> 11:17.807
I should have made fish.

11:17.809 --> 11:20.042
- I'm sorry.
- No, Mom, she...

11:20.044 --> 11:21.777
she doesn't eat any animals.

11:21.779 --> 11:24.347
But she has to have protein.
She's still growing.

11:24.349 --> 11:26.281
Mom, don't say
dumb shit like that.

11:26.283 --> 11:27.618
Hey. Enough, okay?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.752
Honestly, it's fine. I can...

11:29.754 --> 11:31.320
I can eat the salad and bread.

11:31.322 --> 11:32.656
I'll be fine.

11:32.658 --> 11:36.693
Have you always been this way?

11:36.695 --> 11:40.097
Uh, Nicki is, um...
she's also a Buddhist.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.833
Well, that sounds interesting.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.368
You know, I have no idea

11:44.370 --> 11:47.170
what that really means...
"Buddhist."

11:47.172 --> 11:50.406
I always hear people talking
about Buddhism and celebrities,

11:50.408 --> 11:52.374
but nobody says what it is.

11:52.376 --> 11:53.877
Okay. Well, um...

11:53.879 --> 11:56.145
so the root of all suffering

11:56.147 --> 11:59.315
is our desire not to suffer,

11:59.317 --> 12:03.286
so we have to give up
on the idea of being happy.

12:03.288 --> 12:04.688
You're okay
with not being happy?

12:04.690 --> 12:06.355
Yeah, I try not
to think that way.

12:06.357 --> 12:07.757
Happiness is an illusion.

12:07.759 --> 12:09.224
Um, I read this thing

12:09.226 --> 12:11.462
about this kid
who drowned in a river

12:11.464 --> 12:12.929
because the only person
watching him

12:12.931 --> 12:14.698
was this Buddhist monk,
and if you're Buddhist,

12:14.700 --> 12:16.666
you're not supposed
to save anybody's life.

12:16.668 --> 12:20.136
You're not supposed to, like,
interfere with their path.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.570
- Why can't Buddhists save lives?
- Oh!

12:21.572 --> 12:22.772
Where'd you...
where'd you read that?

12:22.774 --> 12:24.174
It was an article.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.675
It was, like, a...
like, a real article

12:25.677 --> 12:27.209
on, like, Huffington Post
or something.

12:27.211 --> 12:29.278
Um, yeah, that's not Buddhism.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.680
Yeah, well, that monk
should be shot.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.248
- Dad.
- Louie.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.749
No, he's right.

12:33.751 --> 12:36.419
I mean, metaphorically,
of course.

12:36.421 --> 12:37.720
Yeah.

12:37.722 --> 12:38.954
You know, metaphorically.

12:38.956 --> 12:40.489
I get it.

12:45.630 --> 12:48.031
I don't know
what to do about Ziggy.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.634
He's lazy.

12:51.035 --> 12:53.435
Agnes, are you listening to me?

12:53.437 --> 12:56.238
Shh. Lower your voice.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.074
What are you reading?

12:58.076 --> 12:59.743
Puzzle instructions.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.411
Don't you just put
all the pieces together

13:01.413 --> 13:02.646
till you run out?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.613
What other instructions
do you need?

13:04.615 --> 13:07.818
Strategies, suggestions.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.819
Doesn't matter.

13:09.821 --> 13:11.220
You know...

13:11.222 --> 13:14.058
only children play
with puzzles, Agnes.

13:15.326 --> 13:17.326
I don't think he's lazy.

13:17.328 --> 13:20.464
He just sits there until
I tell him to do something.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.999
I mean, he does it
when I tell him, but...

13:23.134 --> 13:24.767
he's got no initiative.

13:24.769 --> 13:26.469
All day.

13:32.277 --> 13:34.009
What?

13:34.011 --> 13:35.645
Huh?

13:35.647 --> 13:37.980
You were looking at me
with, like, some kind of...

13:37.982 --> 13:39.648
like, some kind of look
in your eye.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.150
No, I wasn't.

13:41.152 --> 13:43.219
I know you, Agnes.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.122
There was no look.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.459
- Say it.
- There was no look.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.094
You know, I turned down
a doughnut today.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.829
Okay? A jelly doughnut.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.664
You know how hard
that is for me?

13:54.666 --> 13:56.799
You should be
very proud of yourself.

13:56.801 --> 13:58.300
I am.

13:58.302 --> 14:01.171
And I cut back on smoking, too.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.506
And cholesterol...
I mean, that's hereditary.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.177
It's not my fault.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.113
I just don't want to lose you.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.516
Well, then you better
start praying.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.204
Hi, Lucy.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.605
Lent starts in five days.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.507
Since we're no longer
doing the soup kitchen,

14:38.509 --> 14:42.712
we need to start organizing
a food drive.

14:42.714 --> 14:45.348
Is it true Father Kutash
is only doing confession

14:45.350 --> 14:47.684
- once a month now?
- No one shows up.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.919
There's nothing
we can do about it.

14:49.921 --> 14:52.655
I guess we'll just have
to pack our sins

14:52.657 --> 14:55.194
into neat monthly portions.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.566
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

15:03.568 --> 15:05.971
I didn't realize
I was speaking out loud.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.019
Bingo.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.305
Aunt Emily?

16:16.307 --> 16:18.974
How are you?

16:18.976 --> 16:21.076
I heard.

16:21.078 --> 16:23.313
Completely broken?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.150
I'm so sorry.

16:27.485 --> 16:29.486
Good. Good.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.089
It's just, I have a question.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.826
The present you sent
with Vlad...

16:36.059 --> 16:38.527
The puzzle. Yeah.

16:38.529 --> 16:41.263
No, it's very nice.

16:41.265 --> 16:43.465
In fact, I'd like
to get another one.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.169
Where did you buy it?

16:47.773 --> 16:49.472
Uh-huh.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.809
Mm-hmm.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.080
Thompson and Third.

16:56.214 --> 16:57.647
Oh.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.551
That's too bad.

17:00.851 --> 17:02.517
No.

17:02.519 --> 17:05.255
I haven't been
to New York for years.

17:12.329 --> 17:14.363
Now arriving on track four,

17:14.365 --> 17:15.832
the local train to New Haven,

17:15.834 --> 17:17.601
making stops
at Stratford, Milford,

17:17.603 --> 17:19.904
West Haven, then New Haven.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.678
Now arriving, track four.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.690
A ticket
to Grand Central, please.

17:41.692 --> 17:43.392
That's $19.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.161
- How much?
- 19.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.162
I thought it was eight.

17:47.164 --> 17:49.030
It's $19 one way, off-peak,

17:49.032 --> 17:50.834
when you purchase tickets
on board.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.468
Next time,
get it at the station.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.703
It's cheaper. You can get
a ten-trip or a weekly.

17:54.705 --> 17:58.576
No, thanks. I don't think
there'll be a next time.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.126
Could you stop, please?

19:25.128 --> 19:27.632
I'll walk. I'm sorry.

19:55.826 --> 19:57.828
Let me know
if you need any help.

20:26.891 --> 20:28.560
You ready?

20:29.861 --> 20:31.526
What do you think, sir?

20:31.528 --> 20:34.396
- Which one?
- Uh...

20:34.398 --> 20:37.600
Depends on what you
want to spend days looking at.

20:37.602 --> 20:39.469
What do you mean?

20:39.471 --> 20:42.037
They're each
like a thousand pieces.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.841
Take forever.

20:46.676 --> 20:48.713
I'll take both.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.583
What's that about?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.684
"Desperately."

20:55.686 --> 20:57.853
Uh... I don't know.

20:57.855 --> 20:59.855
Some guy.

20:59.857 --> 21:01.257
My father's usually here.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.127
I'm just visiting.

23:12.022 --> 23:14.224
Remember that thou art dust,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.528
and to dust thou shalt return.

23:19.163 --> 23:21.463
Remember that thou art dust,

23:21.465 --> 23:23.601
and to dust thou shalt return.

23:43.721 --> 23:45.891
320...

23:53.064 --> 23:54.966
322.

24:05.876 --> 24:07.276
I'm Agnes.

24:07.278 --> 24:08.844
Hi.

24:08.846 --> 24:10.912
Robert.

24:10.914 --> 24:13.415
Come in.

24:13.417 --> 24:14.816
State authorities enacted

24:14.818 --> 24:16.286
Emergency Relief Act
after flood waters

24:16.288 --> 24:17.719
forced millions
from their homes...

24:17.721 --> 24:19.889
Oh, God.

24:19.891 --> 24:21.957
Have you seen the news?

24:21.959 --> 24:23.258
What?

24:23.260 --> 24:25.761
No. Uh, I'm here
about the puzzles.

24:25.763 --> 24:27.962
Flood in India,
and thousands of people

24:27.964 --> 24:29.565
washed away just like that.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.734
It boggles the mind.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.469
There was an earthquake
in northern Iran, and...

24:34.471 --> 24:35.738
I'm not trying to be gloomy.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.472
I know we're just meeting.

24:37.474 --> 24:41.911
It's just...

24:41.913 --> 24:44.216
too much, you know.

24:45.916 --> 24:48.316
No, I didn't hear...

24:48.318 --> 24:49.951
Oh. Sorry.

24:49.953 --> 24:51.487
You seem to have

24:51.489 --> 24:53.456
some interesting mark
on your forehead.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.724
Oh.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.328
It's Ash Wednesday.

24:57.461 --> 24:59.029
You're Catholic?

25:00.196 --> 25:02.131
Is that a problem?

25:02.133 --> 25:03.900
No, no. Not at all.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.834
As long as we don't
have to share

25:05.836 --> 25:07.469
the prize with the Pope,
you know?

25:08.605 --> 25:10.805
Come.

25:10.807 --> 25:13.511
Uh, what prize?

25:17.381 --> 25:19.084
Coat.

25:20.751 --> 25:24.086
Um, you said prize?

25:24.088 --> 25:26.988
Every competition has a prize.

25:26.990 --> 25:30.125
Your ad never mentioned
a competition.

25:30.127 --> 25:31.794
I thought it was obvious.

25:31.796 --> 25:35.131
"Champion desperately looking
for a puzzle partner."

25:35.133 --> 25:38.036
Did you think I was looking
for companionship?

25:39.502 --> 25:41.536
No, of course not.

25:41.538 --> 25:43.471
Uh, just a partner.

25:43.473 --> 25:45.710
For a competition.

25:59.256 --> 26:01.026
Come in. Come in.

26:07.998 --> 26:09.601
Please sit.

26:13.671 --> 26:15.036
All right.

26:15.038 --> 26:17.642
Let's see how we work together.

26:22.078 --> 26:23.879
Is this a test?

26:23.881 --> 26:25.414
Absolutely.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.585
What is the competition?

26:30.587 --> 26:33.087
National Jigsaw Puzzle
Championship.

26:33.089 --> 26:35.091
I won the singles last year.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.128
My first time.

26:38.695 --> 26:40.996
I didn't know
such a thing existed.

26:40.998 --> 26:42.998
Oh, don't tell anyone.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.502
There'll be a run on the place.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.911
What happened to your partner?

26:54.211 --> 26:56.444
How do you know
I had a partner?

26:56.446 --> 26:58.247
You wouldn't have signed up
for doubles

26:58.249 --> 27:00.082
if you didn't have a partner.

27:00.084 --> 27:01.717
Very good.

27:01.719 --> 27:03.587
She left.

27:06.257 --> 27:09.060
You're not doing it
by color first?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.763
Rule number one
of competitive puzzling:

27:13.765 --> 27:18.234
You've got to organize by color
before you do anything else.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.936
I will do green and the blues.

27:20.938 --> 27:22.938
You do red
and the dark browns.

27:22.940 --> 27:25.009
I've never really
done it that way.

27:35.853 --> 27:38.288
How long have you
been puzzling?

27:39.589 --> 27:41.289
A while.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.595
How long is a while?

27:44.729 --> 27:46.796
I'm very fast.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.963
You said that in your text.
How long?

27:48.965 --> 27:51.799
I don't remember.

27:51.801 --> 27:54.103
Years.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.104
I was always good in math.

27:57.106 --> 27:59.607
Patterns. Shapes.

27:59.609 --> 28:04.113
I picked up a puzzle
the other day, and...

28:04.115 --> 28:06.981
there it was.

28:06.983 --> 28:08.653
Like riding a bike.

28:30.474 --> 28:31.774
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

28:31.776 --> 28:34.043
Go ahead. Go ahead.

28:49.326 --> 28:50.961
Go ahead.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.799
Fuck me.

28:58.801 --> 29:00.571
Pardon my French.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.740
Are you sure you don't need
to think about it?

29:05.742 --> 29:08.043
No. Not-not...
not for a minute.

29:08.045 --> 29:10.211
You're a godsend.

29:10.213 --> 29:13.180
It was meant to be.

29:13.182 --> 29:15.351
So, uh, what works for you?

29:15.353 --> 29:17.519
Like, we have to meet
at least twice a week.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.322
Uh, the tournament
is in a month.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.190
Barely enough time to prepare.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.725
Oh.

29:22.727 --> 29:25.693
Oh. Don't tell me
you can't do it now.

29:25.695 --> 29:26.694
No.

29:26.696 --> 29:27.929
I can do it.

29:27.931 --> 29:29.363
I'll do it.

29:29.365 --> 29:30.599
I want to. I'll...

29:30.601 --> 29:32.767
- Okay.
- Yes.

29:32.769 --> 29:35.336
- Uh... wait.
- So...

29:35.338 --> 29:37.305
Why did she leave you?

29:37.307 --> 29:39.740
Your last partner.

29:39.742 --> 29:42.378
Oh, she just left.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.912
No explanation, really.

29:44.914 --> 29:46.949
Not even a note.

29:46.951 --> 29:50.352
So, she wasn't
just your puzzle partner?

29:50.354 --> 29:52.157
No. She was my wife.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.625
Oh.

29:57.095 --> 29:59.228
Was she good?

29:59.230 --> 30:01.596
At puzzles, I mean.

30:01.598 --> 30:03.999
Not as good as you.

30:07.971 --> 30:10.271
Okay.

30:10.273 --> 30:12.475
Mondays and...

30:12.477 --> 30:14.242
Mondays and Wednesdays?

30:14.244 --> 30:16.245
You don't have to be at work?

30:16.247 --> 30:18.447
No, I-I work at home.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.018
Me, too.

30:23.587 --> 30:26.087
So, I got some bad news.

30:26.089 --> 30:27.957
Aunt Emily is sick.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.992
I mean, she broke her foot,
the poor thing.

30:30.994 --> 30:32.393
Well, that's too bad.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.395
So, I'll be going
to New Rochelle

30:34.397 --> 30:36.230
two days a week
to help her out.

30:36.232 --> 30:39.936
You know, buy groceries,
cook some meals for her.

30:39.938 --> 30:43.007
Mondays and Wednesdays,
for about a month.

30:44.174 --> 30:45.975
That's a long time, Agnes.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.476
You won't even notice
the difference.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.478
Should we go visit her, too?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.412
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Yeah, I, um...

30:51.414 --> 30:54.018
I can't. I got a lot
going on this weekend.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.021
So, I have to write
one essay about

31:00.023 --> 31:02.123
why I want to go to college,
and in another,

31:02.125 --> 31:03.991
I have to describe
a transformative experience

31:03.993 --> 31:05.693
in my life.

31:05.695 --> 31:07.997
How about when you wet your bed
at Cub Scout camp?

31:07.999 --> 31:10.364
That must have been transformative.

31:10.366 --> 31:12.167
- Dude, fuck you!
- Hey, hey.

31:12.169 --> 31:13.501
Language.
You got a lady present.

31:13.503 --> 31:14.970
All right,
let's just face it.

31:14.972 --> 31:17.640
There's nothing
transformative in my life.

31:17.642 --> 31:21.876
Hmm. Maybe I just, like,
shouldn't even go to college.

31:21.878 --> 31:24.648
Hey. Conversation's not
happening right now.

31:28.987 --> 31:32.223
"Transformative"
is such a funny word.

31:33.523 --> 31:38.192
Trans... form... a... tive.

31:38.194 --> 31:40.996
Trans-form-a-tive.

31:40.998 --> 31:42.430
Why are you in such a good mood

31:42.432 --> 31:43.433
all of a sudden, Mom?

31:45.670 --> 31:49.171
I'm just happy
we're together here.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.675
Right now, like this.

31:55.345 --> 31:57.246
She's using you.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.381
Everybody always uses you,
and you let 'em.

31:59.383 --> 32:01.382
She's my aunt.

32:01.384 --> 32:03.552
Yeah, well, she's got
her own family.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.187
I mean, you got things
you gotta do around here.

32:05.189 --> 32:06.188
I mean, we need you.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.890
Like, I got invoices

32:07.892 --> 32:11.095
piled up at the garage
I could use your help with.

32:16.099 --> 32:18.199
All right.

32:18.201 --> 32:20.334
Maybe I'm just
being selfish, all right?

32:20.336 --> 32:21.702
I admit it.

32:21.704 --> 32:23.538
I mean, I love you too much.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.040
You take such good care of us,
I just...

32:26.042 --> 32:27.575
I want you to take it easy.

32:27.577 --> 32:29.544
Is that so wrong?

32:29.546 --> 32:31.380
Let me call her.

32:31.382 --> 32:36.284
No. I'll call her, tell her
I can't come twice a week.

32:36.286 --> 32:38.420
Not even once a week.

32:38.422 --> 32:40.458
For your own sake, Agnes.

32:42.593 --> 32:44.128
Okay.

33:07.585 --> 33:13.857
♪ Ave Maria ♪

33:15.959 --> 33:22.163
♪ Gratia plena ♪

33:22.165 --> 33:24.565
♪ Maria ♪

33:24.567 --> 33:28.903
♪ Gratia plena ♪

33:28.905 --> 33:31.538
♪ Maria ♪

33:31.540 --> 33:35.543
♪ Gratia plena ♪

33:35.545 --> 33:39.780
♪ Ave, ave ♪

33:39.782 --> 33:43.084
♪ Dominus ♪

33:43.086 --> 33:44.486
A massive tornado.

33:44.488 --> 33:46.055
Take a look.
Touching down in Central...

33:46.057 --> 33:47.689
There's a tornado.
I was watching...

33:47.691 --> 33:49.623
I don't have
as much time as I thought.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.459
We better start.

33:51.461 --> 33:53.228
All right.

33:53.230 --> 33:56.198
So, they give you the puzzle,

33:56.200 --> 33:59.434
and you pour
the whole thing out at once.

33:59.436 --> 34:00.835
You don't take little handfuls

34:00.837 --> 34:02.304
and spread them
around the table.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.706
I noticed you doing that
the other day.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.042
You also stand up.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.641
And walk around the table

34:08.643 --> 34:11.478
a couple of times
before you start.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.681
Oh.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.952
You get more perspective
this way.

34:16.954 --> 34:19.420
You see puzzle pieces
without the glare.

34:19.422 --> 34:21.021
You see patterns

34:21.023 --> 34:23.224
you might not have seen
from your chair.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.427
You know,
different color schemes.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.195
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:27.197 --> 34:28.599
Now we can sit.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.202
And it's-it's faster
to divide things up.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.003
I...

34:35.005 --> 34:37.472
I do borders, you do colors.

34:37.474 --> 34:39.376
Well, all right.

34:55.025 --> 34:59.730
Your name should actually
be pronounced "Ag-nesh," right?

35:01.398 --> 35:03.865
That's how my father
would pronounce it.

35:03.867 --> 35:05.367
Yeah.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.037
But I was born here.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.307
Ag-nesh Oros.

35:11.608 --> 35:14.275
I was Mata before Oros.

35:14.277 --> 35:16.177
That's my maiden name.

35:16.179 --> 35:18.914
- Agnes Mata.
- Really?

35:18.916 --> 35:22.519
I bet you heard plenty
of Mata Hari jokes growing up.

35:31.728 --> 35:34.396
Tea, Maria.

35:34.398 --> 35:37.532
That's funny.

35:37.534 --> 35:39.400
What's funny?

35:39.402 --> 35:43.604
A blind man on the train
was singing "Ave Maria."

35:43.606 --> 35:45.307
That's funny how?

35:45.309 --> 35:49.110
"Tea, Maria." "Ave Maria."

35:49.112 --> 35:50.677
I don't know. It's ironic.

35:50.679 --> 35:51.979
That's not irony.

35:51.981 --> 35:53.949
That's coincidence.

35:53.951 --> 35:56.387
It doesn't mean anything.

35:57.521 --> 35:59.891
Has to mean something.

36:01.791 --> 36:05.193
You don't really
believe that, do you?

36:05.195 --> 36:06.797
Come.

36:14.503 --> 36:16.336
I'm fine, ma'am, thank you.

36:16.338 --> 36:17.875
She's fine.

36:27.284 --> 36:29.220
- Thank you, Maria.
- Mmm.

36:40.297 --> 36:42.162
You're so much more comfortable

36:42.164 --> 36:44.969
when you're focusing
on the puzzles, aren't you?

36:48.371 --> 36:50.173
Why?

36:51.807 --> 36:53.740
You ask a lot of questions.

36:57.146 --> 36:59.182
Yeah.

37:00.918 --> 37:04.019
That's how you get
to know someone.

37:04.021 --> 37:06.420
But I don't ask you anything.

37:06.422 --> 37:08.925
Go ahead.

37:14.364 --> 37:16.363
I can't think of a question
right now.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.233
That's my point.

37:18.235 --> 37:21.572
You're uncomfortable around me.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.811
Well, I don't know you.

37:29.512 --> 37:32.048
But it's not just that.
I, uh...

37:33.449 --> 37:37.719
I'm not comfortable,
generally,

37:37.721 --> 37:41.356
because I...

37:41.358 --> 37:45.630
because, normally,
my mind is, uh...

37:49.032 --> 37:50.999
I don't know.

37:51.001 --> 37:54.101
Because, normally,
your mind is moving so fast,

37:54.103 --> 37:56.737
you don't really know
where it's going.

37:56.739 --> 37:59.141
There's nowhere for you
to express your mind.

37:59.143 --> 38:00.874
No one to express it to.

38:00.876 --> 38:02.980
It makes you nervous.

38:04.215 --> 38:08.148
So you focus on menial tasks.

38:08.150 --> 38:12.119
Puzzles are menial tasks
for you, so you can focus.

38:12.121 --> 38:14.590
But the results
are aesthetically pleasing,

38:14.592 --> 38:18.396
you like it,
and it turns you on.

38:24.266 --> 38:25.935
What?

38:27.903 --> 38:31.639
I'm not sure I totally
understand what you just said.

38:35.079 --> 38:38.079
Honestly, Agnes,
if you learn the rules

38:38.081 --> 38:41.516
and hone the technique,
I think we have a good chance

38:41.518 --> 38:43.385
at going to Belgium.

38:43.387 --> 38:46.121
- Belgium?
- If we win the nationals,

38:46.123 --> 38:50.291
we go to the World Jigsaw
Puzzle Federation competition.

38:50.293 --> 38:54.228
It's in Brussels,
right after the nationals.

38:54.230 --> 38:57.465
You don't want a free trip
to the ancestral home

38:57.467 --> 39:01.204
of the Brussels sprout, Mata?

39:03.005 --> 39:05.842
I don't think
we have time for tea.

40:26.856 --> 40:27.856
Mmm.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.523
What is this?

40:29.525 --> 40:31.392
You trying to kill me
or something?

40:31.394 --> 40:32.961
No. God.

40:32.963 --> 40:34.461
It's just, you've been so good.

40:34.463 --> 40:36.197
I'm just kidding.

40:36.199 --> 40:39.534
I thought maybe I'd take
a look at the invoices.

40:39.536 --> 40:40.934
All right.

40:40.936 --> 40:42.771
Hey, Ziggy!

40:42.773 --> 40:44.942
Come out here a second.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.443
- Zig!
- What?

40:48.445 --> 40:50.878
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- Hi.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.280
Where were you?

40:52.282 --> 40:54.249
I was in the bathroom.

40:54.251 --> 40:56.418
But you just came from outside.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.851
Yeah, I was taking
a smoke break.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.052
Well, why'd you say
you were in the bathroom

40:59.054 --> 41:00.354
if you were out having a smoke?

41:00.356 --> 41:01.889
'Cause that's where
I was before.

41:01.891 --> 41:03.291
You don't want me to smoke
in the bathroom, right?

41:03.293 --> 41:05.095
I'm gonna get started.

41:13.402 --> 41:15.403
Listen, we're gonna run

41:15.405 --> 41:17.972
a diagnostic on the car,
check the electrical work.

41:17.974 --> 41:20.141
We might find some damage.

41:20.143 --> 41:21.577
We're gonna check everything,
all right?

41:21.579 --> 41:23.244
All right. I don't know, I...

41:23.246 --> 41:24.479
Now, hopefully, the chassis

41:24.481 --> 41:26.079
doesn't need straightening out.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.427
All the other guys
flirt with the customers,

41:39.429 --> 41:40.961
and he just, like,

41:40.963 --> 41:44.666
talks about how awesome
his wife is all the time.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.769
Your father is a decent,
good man.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.804
Yeah. That's what
he says about you.

41:50.806 --> 41:52.542
That's nice.

41:57.579 --> 41:59.650
Are you okay, Zig?

42:01.851 --> 42:03.521
Uh...

42:04.954 --> 42:06.657
I don't know.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.325
Yeah, I'm miserable.
I hate my life.

42:11.327 --> 42:12.994
Oh, honey.

42:12.996 --> 42:14.494
Dad hired me out of pity.

42:14.496 --> 42:16.197
That's not true.

42:16.199 --> 42:18.900
I'm not good at this.

42:18.902 --> 42:22.304
Do you have any idea
what it's like to spend all day

42:22.306 --> 42:24.508
not doing something
you're good at?

42:26.943 --> 42:29.844
So, what would you rather do?

42:29.846 --> 42:32.012
What are you good at?

42:32.014 --> 42:35.152
I don't think I'm good
at anything.

42:42.858 --> 42:44.360
I want to cook, Mom.

42:45.494 --> 42:46.894
What?

42:46.896 --> 42:49.329
I've watched you cook
my whole life.

42:49.331 --> 42:52.435
I watch cooking shows
when no one's home.

42:54.405 --> 42:58.472
I think I'd be happy doing
what you do, not what Dad does.

42:58.474 --> 43:00.675
But I don't do anything.

43:00.677 --> 43:03.311
Are you fucking kidding?

43:03.313 --> 43:07.284
Mom, you do a million things,
and you're good at all of them.

43:11.554 --> 43:14.255
I feel bad Ziggy never
got to go to college.

43:14.257 --> 43:16.124
Well, he had terrible grades.

43:16.126 --> 43:17.724
Gabe's the smart one.

43:17.726 --> 43:19.025
But still.

43:19.027 --> 43:20.795
Maybe he should have tried,

43:20.797 --> 43:22.664
or we should have
helped him try.

43:22.666 --> 43:24.999
We didn't have any money
for that.

43:26.568 --> 43:27.901
Do you ever wish you'd gone?

43:27.903 --> 43:29.436
To college, I mean.

43:29.438 --> 43:32.373
Learn something
just to know it?

43:32.375 --> 43:35.079
No. I would have hated college.

43:36.547 --> 43:39.246
I think I would have
majored in math.

43:39.248 --> 43:41.481
Math, huh?

43:41.483 --> 43:43.119
You're cute.

43:44.621 --> 43:46.755
Ever wonder what your life
would be like

43:46.757 --> 43:48.789
if you met me
a few years later?

43:48.791 --> 43:50.594
Or never met me at all?

43:52.295 --> 43:53.795
Not for one second.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.429
I thank God every day
I have you.

43:56.431 --> 43:58.167
Every single day?

43:59.268 --> 44:01.104
Yeah. And night.

44:03.940 --> 44:06.974
I think we should
watch the news.

44:06.976 --> 44:08.309
Now?

44:08.311 --> 44:11.512
No. Just more often.

44:11.514 --> 44:14.782
Why? Nothing good
ever happens in the world.

44:14.784 --> 44:17.684
Still, shouldn't we
know about it?

44:17.686 --> 44:20.121
Uh... hey, Agnes.

44:20.123 --> 44:22.525
- Still here.
- Sorry.

44:38.307 --> 44:40.441
When I was in your office
doing paperwork,

44:40.443 --> 44:43.545
I saw one of
the bank statements.

44:43.547 --> 44:47.115
Well, I told you we had
a pretty bad year.

44:47.117 --> 44:50.017
You didn't tell me
it was that bad.

44:50.019 --> 44:52.820
We don't have enough
to send Gabe to college.

44:52.822 --> 44:55.389
He's gonna need
a full scholarship now.

44:55.391 --> 44:58.494
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I work my ass off.

44:59.862 --> 45:02.363
We could sell
the land in Ellenville.

45:02.365 --> 45:05.032
But we love going
to Ellenville.

45:05.034 --> 45:08.001
- No, it's impossible.
- Why?

45:08.003 --> 45:10.704
Why? Because fishing's the most
important thing in my life.

45:10.706 --> 45:12.874
What?

45:12.876 --> 45:17.045
Fishing is the most important
thing in your life?

45:17.047 --> 45:19.750
Come on, Agnes. You know
that's not what I meant.

45:26.655 --> 45:28.889
Are you going somewhere?

45:28.891 --> 45:31.057
No. We are.

45:31.059 --> 45:32.827
Together? Where?

45:32.829 --> 45:34.195
Oh, it's a surprise.

45:34.197 --> 45:35.695
I don't like surprises.

45:35.697 --> 45:37.298
You'll like this one.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.736
Come.

45:41.905 --> 45:46.007
I don't understand why
we have to compete already.

45:46.009 --> 45:48.077
What's the big deal?

45:49.878 --> 45:51.880
Who are these people?

45:51.882 --> 45:55.215
I thought we'd do this
to boost your confidence.

45:55.217 --> 45:58.586
Well, you thought wrong.

45:58.588 --> 46:01.424
All right, j-just focus
on what I'm doing.

46:05.661 --> 46:07.829
I looked you up.

46:07.831 --> 46:11.766
I mean, I Googled you
on my phone.

46:11.768 --> 46:13.700
Oh.

46:13.702 --> 46:15.101
You're an inventor?

46:15.103 --> 46:17.405
Uh, not really.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.807
Something about magnets?

46:19.809 --> 46:21.608
Yeah. No.

46:21.610 --> 46:24.612
Uh... uh...

46:24.614 --> 46:27.081
I have a patent under my name.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.249
One invention...
one good idea that took off.

46:29.251 --> 46:30.619
That's it.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.054
I stumbled onto it
almost by accident.

46:33.056 --> 46:35.255
Haven't come up
with anything since.

46:35.257 --> 46:36.925
It made you rich.

46:36.927 --> 46:38.927
It was a fluke.
I'm not an inventor.

46:38.929 --> 46:40.297
Let's just do the puzzle.

46:43.934 --> 46:46.503
Why are people staring at us?

46:49.405 --> 46:50.905
Okay, okay.

46:53.844 --> 46:56.344
This was a bad idea.

46:56.346 --> 46:58.780
I'm sorry.

46:58.782 --> 47:01.416
Let us get out of here.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.387
At the end,
she just didn't like me.

47:07.389 --> 47:08.991
We got divorced.

47:10.425 --> 47:13.628
And I never wanted kids anyway.

47:13.630 --> 47:15.762
Why not?

47:15.764 --> 47:18.333
Frankly, I don't like kids.

47:20.302 --> 47:22.137
How can you say that?

47:22.139 --> 47:24.304
You were a kid yourself once.

47:24.306 --> 47:26.309
Right, and I hated it.

47:28.545 --> 47:30.945
Not everyone's supposed
to have kids, you know.

47:30.947 --> 47:33.615
And not only
for selfish reasons.

47:33.617 --> 47:36.016
Sometimes for the kids' sake.

47:37.820 --> 47:40.521
In this town...

47:40.523 --> 47:43.923
kids are an ornament,
a fashion statement,

47:43.925 --> 47:46.693
an accessory, a...

47:46.695 --> 47:49.865
a check box.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.633
Honestly,
I never felt the need.

47:52.635 --> 47:55.372
Does that make me weird?

48:00.677 --> 48:02.913
Is everything okay, Ziggy?

48:04.179 --> 48:06.380
Yes. You scared me.

48:08.184 --> 48:10.721
Well, this is
my emergency phone.

48:12.355 --> 48:14.856
I'm not at home right now.

48:14.858 --> 48:17.157
I'm out.

48:17.159 --> 48:20.463
Out.
I'm at a church meeting.

48:22.865 --> 48:25.066
Yes.

48:25.068 --> 48:27.237
I'll see you later.

48:28.570 --> 48:30.604
Church?

48:30.606 --> 48:33.007
I have to go.

48:33.009 --> 48:34.374
Was that your son?

48:34.376 --> 48:35.543
Yeah.

48:35.545 --> 48:38.579
My oldest accessory.

48:40.682 --> 48:43.717
And no, it doesn't
make you weird.

48:43.719 --> 48:46.820
Just different...

48:46.822 --> 48:49.525
from everybody I've ever met.

48:57.032 --> 49:00.233
I'm sorry I'm late.

49:00.235 --> 49:01.737
Ezster.

49:03.539 --> 49:05.738
You missed
the Ladies Guild meeting.

49:05.740 --> 49:07.708
We were worried.

49:07.710 --> 49:09.409
That was today?

49:09.411 --> 49:11.945
Yes, it was.

49:11.947 --> 49:15.115
I-I was with my Aunt Emily.
I'm sorry.

49:15.117 --> 49:16.851
She had an accident.

49:16.853 --> 49:18.952
She broke her foot, and, uh,

49:18.954 --> 49:20.186
she needed me.

49:20.188 --> 49:21.923
There was no one else.

49:21.925 --> 49:24.425
Anyway, I was at
the grocery store,

49:24.427 --> 49:27.097
and the line
was just out the door.

49:32.168 --> 49:35.135
You can't tell me
to refuse a poor woman in need,

49:35.137 --> 49:37.137
and during Lent.

49:37.139 --> 49:40.106
It's bad enough your sister
casts an evil eye on me

49:40.108 --> 49:41.575
for missing the church meeting.

49:41.577 --> 49:43.142
Okay, you're exaggerating.

49:43.144 --> 49:44.746
Ezster is not...

49:44.748 --> 49:46.780
For once, take my side.

49:46.782 --> 49:49.150
There's so much pain
all around us.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.052
So much suffering in the world.

49:51.054 --> 49:52.954
Why shouldn't I help?

49:54.324 --> 49:56.691
What does that mean?

49:56.693 --> 50:00.295
You lied to me, like a child.

50:00.297 --> 50:03.197
You denied me
an act of charity,

50:03.199 --> 50:05.666
like a heartless master.

50:05.668 --> 50:07.501
What is that supposed to mean?

50:07.503 --> 50:09.470
You know exactly what it means.

50:15.010 --> 50:16.512
Hey.

50:19.148 --> 50:20.884
You shouldn't smoke.

50:25.353 --> 50:27.089
You shouldn't lie.

50:36.032 --> 50:38.731
I'm sorry. I...

50:38.733 --> 50:41.137
Nah, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.974
Whatever it is, uh...

50:47.976 --> 50:50.646
I hope it's something
that makes you feel good.

50:52.648 --> 50:55.883
It's nothing like that.

50:55.885 --> 50:58.889
Why didn't you ever
divorce him?

51:00.990 --> 51:03.860
Seriously,
you've never really been happy.

51:06.429 --> 51:08.429
I don't think a mother and son

51:08.431 --> 51:11.367
should be having
a conversation like this.

51:13.335 --> 51:15.071
Whatever.

51:18.907 --> 51:21.175
Can I have one?

51:21.177 --> 51:23.142
Cigarette?

51:23.144 --> 51:24.748
Yeah.

51:53.509 --> 51:55.610
Jesus, Mom.

51:55.612 --> 51:58.077
When's the last time
you had one?

51:58.079 --> 51:59.949
This is my first.

52:03.786 --> 52:05.688
Thank you.

52:08.724 --> 52:11.090
Five. Four.

52:11.092 --> 52:14.360
Three. Two. One.

52:21.271 --> 52:24.137
Five more minutes, please.

52:24.139 --> 52:27.109
Take an hour or two.

52:29.177 --> 52:30.779
What?

52:33.815 --> 52:36.249
Mata?

52:36.251 --> 52:38.753
I'm early. I'm sorry.

52:38.755 --> 52:41.021
- I can come back.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:41.023 --> 52:42.726
Come in. Come in.

52:45.927 --> 52:47.996
The elections
are too close to call.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.097
They think there's
going to be a coup.

52:50.099 --> 52:51.566
Go ahead.
I'll be right there.

52:51.568 --> 52:52.936
Please.

53:04.213 --> 53:06.680
Oh, I should
put that stuff away.

53:06.682 --> 53:08.885
Is this where you work?

53:14.123 --> 53:15.192
Tea?

53:16.858 --> 53:18.758
Okay.

53:31.474 --> 53:34.976
Mata, if you have picked up
a piece and looked at it,

53:34.978 --> 53:36.909
don't put it back;
set it aside.

53:36.911 --> 53:38.545
It will save us time later.

53:38.547 --> 53:40.015
Remember?

53:44.721 --> 53:46.056
Excuse me.

53:58.034 --> 53:59.367
I should go.

53:59.369 --> 54:01.068
Oh.

54:01.070 --> 54:04.237
Oh, please, please, please,
don't rush out on me.

54:04.239 --> 54:06.840
It's 3:00 already.

54:06.842 --> 54:08.409
I can't be late home.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.411
No, if-if you want,
I'll-I'll...

54:10.413 --> 54:12.912
I will come
to your home next time.

54:12.914 --> 54:14.949
I'll see you here Monday.

54:14.951 --> 54:19.289
And next time, put on some
real clothes, for God's sake.

54:28.097 --> 54:30.863
What?

54:30.865 --> 54:32.532
What?

54:32.534 --> 54:34.534
You're snoring.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.072
What do you want me
to do about it?

54:39.074 --> 54:41.242
Stop.

54:41.244 --> 54:44.045
How?

54:44.047 --> 54:46.249
I don't know.

55:22.251 --> 55:24.617
Second paragraph.

55:24.619 --> 55:26.887
All right, let's see. Uh...

55:26.889 --> 55:30.090
"My mother doesn't know
anything about the world

55:30.092 --> 55:32.492
"outside of our house,
our church,

55:32.494 --> 55:35.864
"our traditions and our family.

55:38.101 --> 55:40.766
"She, like my father
and brother,

55:40.768 --> 55:42.371
never went to..."

55:43.938 --> 55:45.539
It says "collage."

55:45.541 --> 55:47.106
He spelled "college" wrong.

55:47.108 --> 55:48.775
Probably spell-check.

55:48.777 --> 55:50.311
Keep going.

55:50.313 --> 55:53.847
"I love my mother,
but I also feel bad for her.

55:53.849 --> 55:56.650
"She's a sheltered person
and doesn't think of anything

55:56.652 --> 55:58.987
"but serving the men
in her life.

56:00.155 --> 56:02.023
"A child
of Hungarian immigrants,

56:02.025 --> 56:04.525
"she lost her mother
when she was young

56:04.527 --> 56:07.128
"and grew up doting on her dad.

56:07.130 --> 56:11.465
"She's still living
in the house he raised her in.

56:11.467 --> 56:14.668
"I want to be different.
I want to go to college

56:14.670 --> 56:18.539
"and learn about other cultures
and not just my own.

56:18.541 --> 56:20.840
"I don't just want
to become my father,

56:20.842 --> 56:23.709
"who is too scared
to think outside the box,

56:23.711 --> 56:28.550
or my mother, who just won't
let herself come alive."

56:32.788 --> 56:36.925
Well, he does say he loves you.

56:40.163 --> 56:41.362
Oh, God.

56:41.364 --> 56:43.099
Come on, Mata.

56:44.768 --> 56:47.934
To me,
this all just rings false.

56:47.936 --> 56:51.438
It doesn't sound
like you at all.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.541
I think it sounds
exactly like me.

56:54.543 --> 56:56.309
I disagree. You-you can...

56:56.311 --> 56:57.680
You don't know me.

56:58.815 --> 57:00.849
Hey.

57:01.983 --> 57:03.353
Hey.

57:05.221 --> 57:09.789
I know that you are the best
puzzler I've ever met.

57:09.791 --> 57:12.860
I know that you are modest
and funny

57:12.862 --> 57:14.729
and...

57:14.731 --> 57:16.262
and beautiful

57:16.264 --> 57:18.231
and strange.

57:25.106 --> 57:27.340
I don't know...

57:27.342 --> 57:29.510
I don't know
why someone like you

57:29.512 --> 57:31.614
would find me interesting.

57:32.748 --> 57:34.983
That's exactly why.

57:39.989 --> 57:41.958
Ag-nesh.

57:44.092 --> 57:45.661
Can I...

57:46.795 --> 57:49.631
Can I kiss you right now?

57:58.273 --> 57:59.706
This is New Rochelle.

57:59.708 --> 58:01.344
New Rochelle Station.

58:07.483 --> 58:09.081
I feel terrible
that I wasn't able

58:09.083 --> 58:12.251
to come visit you any sooner,
Aunt Emily.

58:12.253 --> 58:14.787
Oh, I've got plenty of people
looking in on me.

58:14.789 --> 58:17.258
It's like Grand Central Station
in here sometimes

58:17.260 --> 58:20.595
with the grandkids
and great-grandkids.

58:20.597 --> 58:22.695
I keep getting
their names wrong.

58:22.697 --> 58:25.902
This helps an old lady like me.

58:28.271 --> 58:30.273
How are you, Agnes?

58:32.440 --> 58:34.042
Me?

58:35.277 --> 58:37.179
I'm, uh...

58:38.847 --> 58:40.650
I feel...

58:42.684 --> 58:44.851
I'm different.

58:44.853 --> 58:46.655
I'm...

58:47.822 --> 58:49.722
...not good.

58:49.724 --> 58:52.025
But not bad at all.

58:52.027 --> 58:53.663
In between.

58:54.862 --> 58:56.498
Louie?

58:58.166 --> 59:00.099
He's the same.

59:00.101 --> 59:02.168
I'm just,

59:02.170 --> 59:04.436
all of a sudden...

59:04.438 --> 59:05.706
Hmm.

59:05.708 --> 59:08.175
That happens sometimes.

59:08.177 --> 59:11.545
I got mad at your Uncle Laszlo

59:11.547 --> 59:15.648
about the same things
for 50 years.

59:15.650 --> 59:18.219
Every day, same thing.

59:18.221 --> 59:20.153
Then one day,

59:20.155 --> 59:22.222
I just stopped.

59:22.224 --> 59:25.525
Didn't matter anymore.

59:25.527 --> 59:29.162
I always thought you two
had a great marriage.

59:29.164 --> 59:31.199
We did.

59:37.139 --> 59:39.572
♪ Clap for the Wolfman ♪

59:39.574 --> 59:43.142
♪ He gonna rate
your record high ♪

59:43.144 --> 59:45.112
♪ Mmm ♪

59:45.114 --> 59:47.380
♪ Yes, gracious ♪

59:47.382 --> 59:49.383
♪ Clap for the Wolfman ♪

59:49.385 --> 59:54.121
♪ You gonna dig him
till the day you die. ♪

59:56.090 --> 59:58.060
This is what it's all about.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.037
Fine.

01:00:11.039 --> 01:00:13.576
I'll think about it.

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:16.443
Thank you.

01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:18.646
I'm not saying
we're selling it.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.880
But I'll give it some thought.

01:00:20.882 --> 01:00:22.816
At my own pace.

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:25.121
You're the big boss.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:48.175
What?

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.443
Nothing.

01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:53.345
Everything's perfect.

01:00:53.347 --> 01:00:55.451
Just like this.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.787
Ouch.

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.057
What?

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:05.325
My back, the ground.

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:07.061
Oh, Agnes.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.829
Let's switch.

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:17.737
Letting all the cold air in.

01:01:26.047 --> 01:01:28.380
- Is that better?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.858
Ow.

01:01:55.476 --> 01:01:57.376
A puzzle competition?

01:01:57.378 --> 01:01:58.947
Really?

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.385
Well, how big is it?

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:06.987
- 500 pieces.
- No, not the puzzle.

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.322
The... the competition.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.722
Oh.

01:02:09.724 --> 01:02:14.896
About 360
in the individual competition.

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.668
Look, I don't think
it's such a good idea.

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:23.202
I'm doing it.

01:02:23.204 --> 01:02:24.436
Honey...

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:26.440
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.175
I'm finally doing
something on my own,

01:02:29.177 --> 01:02:32.345
and you can support me or not.

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:34.417
I'll do it either way.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.318
Wow. Do you want me to sign up
and do it with you?

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.222
No.

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.693
I'm doing it by myself.

01:02:58.974 --> 01:03:00.541
Don't even try.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.075
That's not gonna fit yet.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:03.876
You're wasting your time.

01:03:03.878 --> 01:03:06.412
Maybe I should just
watch you do it, then.

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:08.581
Okay.

01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:10.516
I was kidding.

01:03:10.518 --> 01:03:12.251
That's a mistake.

01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:15.255
I don't have a sense of humor.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:17.224
Never have, never will.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.360
That's why we get along.

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:22.795
All you care about
are disasters.

01:03:22.797 --> 01:03:25.433
That's actually funny.

01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:32.338
What? Stay.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.340
Have a drink with me.

01:03:34.342 --> 01:03:36.344
I have to beat the traffic.

01:03:37.612 --> 01:03:39.581
I'll see you next week.

01:03:41.583 --> 01:03:44.619
I'll miss you, Mata.

01:03:54.028 --> 01:03:56.065
Why did you say that?

01:03:57.331 --> 01:03:59.099
'Cause I meant it.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.037
How can you mean it?

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:05.740
I don't know.

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:12.146
How can this be happening?

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.914
I don't know.

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:19.119
Why are we wasting
all this time doing puzzles?

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:22.488
What else is there to do?

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:25.458
It's a childish hobby
for bored people.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.994
You know that's not true.

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:31.331
Tell me you're not
a bored rich guy.

01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.465
Tell me I'm not
a childish housewife.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:35.836
No, that's not what we are.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:38.637
You have much more
important things to do.

01:04:38.639 --> 01:04:40.407
You're a man of ideas.

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:45.045
Why do you do
these stupid puzzles?

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.981
It's a way...

01:04:47.983 --> 01:04:50.816
to control the chaos.

01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:52.719
That's ridiculous.

01:04:52.721 --> 01:04:55.722
Come on, Mata, you...
you're missing the point.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:57.590
Okay.

01:04:57.592 --> 01:04:59.961
What is the point, Robert?

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:02.662
Life is messy.

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:04.530
It doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:06.400
Sorry to break the news to you.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:09.137
Life's just random.

01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:12.472
Everything's random.

01:05:12.474 --> 01:05:16.008
My success, you here now.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:20.579
There's nothing we can do
to control anything.

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:24.818
But when you complete a puzzle,
when you finish it,

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.287
you know that you have made
all the right choices.

01:05:28.289 --> 01:05:31.224
No matter how many wrong pieces
you tried to fit

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:34.128
into a wrong place,
but at the very end,

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:37.231
everything makes
one perfect picture.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.365
What other pursuits
can give you

01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:41.737
that kind of perfection?

01:05:43.038 --> 01:05:44.704
Faith?

01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:46.876
Ambition? Wealth?

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.378
Love?

01:05:53.715 --> 01:05:55.418
No.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.989
Not even love
can do that, Mata.

01:06:07.161 --> 01:06:08.930
Not completely.

01:06:30.318 --> 01:06:32.021
Confession, Agnes?

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.161
How about you? Confession?

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:42.262
Nah, Nicki's parents are jerks.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.630
They grounded her for a month,

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.298
then they went away
on a cruise.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.135
And now her stepsister
is watching her like a warden.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.635
A warden doesn't
watch the prisoners.

01:06:49.637 --> 01:06:51.104
The guards do.

01:06:51.106 --> 01:06:52.639
Whatever.
It's the same difference.

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.675
She's in jail,
and I need to break her out.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.275
Oh...

01:06:58.179 --> 01:07:02.115
My manchego
isn't in the cheese drawer.

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:07.019
I didn't go
grocery shopping today.

01:07:07.021 --> 01:07:08.688
- Sorry.
- What?

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:10.224
Oh, that's too bad.

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.561
I was looking forward
to that stuff.

01:07:13.827 --> 01:07:15.695
I said I'm sorry.

01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:17.699
I'll get some tomorrow.
Jesus.

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.668
What are you looking at?

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:24.637
Can't you do something?

01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:26.305
Like?

01:07:26.307 --> 01:07:28.675
Like, why don't you
set the table for once?

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.309
Ziggy helps out when he can.

01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:32.811
Who made you the prince
in this family?

01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:34.582
Okay.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.659
So, I got into the tournament.

01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:49.662
I signed up.

01:07:49.664 --> 01:07:52.331
Oh, good.
You took my advice.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:55.168
Your mother is gonna do
a puzzle competition.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.836
Jigsaw puzzles.

01:07:56.838 --> 01:07:59.338
- Cool.
- Nice.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.807
What happens if you win?

01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:03.675
What do you mean?

01:08:03.677 --> 01:08:05.211
If you win, what do you get?

01:08:05.213 --> 01:08:06.612
Is there a prize?

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:08.048
Oh.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:09.849
I don't know.

01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:12.017
I think you get
a trophy or something.

01:08:12.019 --> 01:08:13.621
Something small.

01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:17.557
- To Mom.
- To Mama.

01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:19.962
To Mom and to competition.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:24.663
You know, your mother and I,

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.866
we want to talk to you two
about something else.

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:31.536
We're gonna sell the land
in Ellenville.

01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:33.106
You're kidding.

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:34.607
It's for the two of you.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.442
Well, you know, for, uh, Gabe,

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.377
for you to have money
for your education,

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.915
and, Ziggy, you know, so that
you can get your own place,

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.582
you know, when you're ready.

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:45.085
Put a down payment on a house.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.451
Lou, when did we, uh...?

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:47.953
Wait. Seriously?

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:50.557
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's no joke.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.225
Okay, but don't you want to
spend that money on yourselves?

01:08:53.228 --> 01:08:54.560
Take a vacation or something.

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.928
Mom, you barely leave
the house.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.263
Go to Montreal.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:58.630
You've always wanted
to go there.

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:00.901
No, okay?
It's a gift for you two.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:02.635
End of story.

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:04.773
I think it's a great idea.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.649
I don't understand
how you could

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.785
make a decision like that
without me.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.120
It was your idea.

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:24.490
But the last time we talked,
you said you'd think about it.

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:26.326
I did think about it.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.327
But we didn't even get
to discuss it first.

01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:30.095
Well, wh-what is there
to discuss?

01:09:30.096 --> 01:09:31.800
It's what you wanted.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:34.968
What?

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.636
I don't understand
what the fucking problem is.

01:09:37.639 --> 01:09:39.339
The fucking problem
is my fucking husband

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.810
not thinking
there's a fucking problem.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.484
Ah, fuck.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.854
Hey, Ag, uh...

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:56.990
couple of people said
they didn't get their invite

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.625
to the Easter party.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.293
Oh, that's strange.

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:01.660
I mailed them all.

01:10:01.662 --> 01:10:03.629
I'm helping Mom cook
for the party.

01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:04.599
Okay.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:08.934
Hey, can you, uh...

01:10:08.936 --> 01:10:11.970
not forget to get my cheese?

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:13.705
Hey.

01:10:13.707 --> 01:10:16.876
So, um, guess what, everyone.
I have some good news.

01:10:16.878 --> 01:10:20.713
I have decided what I'm gonna
do with the Ellenville money.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:23.383
Stop that.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.384
That money is for college.

01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:27.853
I, um... I'm gonna
take a year off.

01:10:27.855 --> 01:10:29.988
I'm gonna go to Tibet
with Nicki.

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:33.026
And I, uh, think I'm gonna go
to college eventually,

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.562
but I just kind of want
to take some time

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.196
to figure out what
I'm gonna do exactly.

01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.232
Dad said that money
is for a house for Ziggy

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:40.700
and your college.

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:42.104
Um...

01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:46.041
Well, no. He kind of said
that it was a gift.

01:10:50.677 --> 01:10:53.879
Are you gonna say anything?

01:10:53.881 --> 01:10:56.484
I mean, travel's kind of
an education unto itself.

01:10:58.686 --> 01:11:00.588
Louie?

01:11:02.423 --> 01:11:04.627
I did say it was a gift.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.379
The Kilauea volcano flow

01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:27.946
has continued its escalation,

01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:29.848
and locals hope it won't
engulf the town below.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.550
Some locals tell us,
while the lava

01:11:31.552 --> 01:11:33.518
won't necessarily hit
their homes or businesses...

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.789
Hello?

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.257
What are you doing right now?

01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:39.925
What am I doing?

01:11:39.927 --> 01:11:41.460
I'm doing nothing, really.

01:11:41.462 --> 01:11:43.830
As usual.

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.299
Authorities reported
the flow moving 11 to 14...

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.334
Happy Holy Thursday.

01:11:48.336 --> 01:11:51.571
Is it Thursday already?

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.638
Holy Thursday.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.777
Tomorrow is Good Friday,
and Sunday is Easter.

01:11:57.779 --> 01:11:59.579
The resurrection.

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:03.415
I know what Easter is, Mata.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:07.119
I also know that you are not
the believer you once were.

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:08.988
And that's okay.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.258
I like it
when you call me Mata.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.992
That's who you are.

01:12:13.994 --> 01:12:16.329
It was.

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.300
It used to be.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.468
God.

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:25.170
It's the worst thing
I've ever done.

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:26.438
Wait, what?

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.407
What happened?

01:12:28.409 --> 01:12:30.276
- Kissing you.
- Oh.

01:12:30.278 --> 01:12:32.010
Wow.

01:12:32.012 --> 01:12:35.447
If that's the worst thing
you have ever done, Agnes,

01:12:35.449 --> 01:12:38.250
you are pretty damn lucky.

01:12:41.823 --> 01:12:45.058
I haven't gone to confession.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.027
I don't know
how to confess this.

01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:51.032
I've been telling lies.

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:56.438
I love you.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:18.977
Oh. Hi.

01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:20.882
You okay, Mom?

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.952
Where's dinner?

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:29.923
I guess I forgot.

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:32.025
You forgot about dinner?

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.759
What else you forget about?

01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:35.495
You forget about us?

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:36.829
I'm sorry.

01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:38.734
Just be a minute.

01:15:44.639 --> 01:15:46.507
Did you buy my cheese?

01:15:48.376 --> 01:15:50.045
Did you forget about that, too?

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.952
I did.

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.719
You think this is funny?

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.687
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, Dad.

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:04.523
No, I slave all day
for this family.

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:06.424
I come home,
and you're making puzzles?

01:16:06.426 --> 01:16:08.061
Look, I'm gonna
make dinner for everyone, okay?

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.695
Dad, just go upstairs
and take a shower.

01:16:09.697 --> 01:16:10.862
I'll take care of it.

01:16:10.864 --> 01:16:13.232
No, this is bullshit.

01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:15.637
If you leave now,
don't come back.

01:16:29.516 --> 01:16:31.353
Finished.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.589
I'll make you dinner now, dear.

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.592
You know a third
of the population...

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.826
I think it's something
like 34%...

01:16:40.828 --> 01:16:44.763
in Tibet, they live below
the poverty line.

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:47.666
That's a dollar
and 25 cents a day.

01:16:47.668 --> 01:16:50.535
How is anyone expected
to survive like that?

01:16:50.537 --> 01:16:53.205
God, just basic needs.

01:16:53.207 --> 01:16:56.143
Shelter, food, clothes.

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.582
I've been thinking.

01:17:02.483 --> 01:17:05.884
Ziggy, maybe instead
of getting your own place,

01:17:05.886 --> 01:17:08.420
you could go back to school.

01:17:08.422 --> 01:17:10.990
Maybe culinary school.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.991
Culinary school?

01:17:12.993 --> 01:17:14.960
You want him to be a cook?

01:17:14.962 --> 01:17:17.796
He's clearly good at it.

01:17:17.798 --> 01:17:18.930
So what?

01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:21.166
You think it's a bad idea?

01:17:21.168 --> 01:17:23.067
Frankly, I don't think
it's a very manly thing to do,

01:17:23.069 --> 01:17:24.005
is what I think.

01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:27.473
All the great chefs
today are men.

01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:29.541
- Most.
- No one asked you.

01:17:29.543 --> 01:17:32.445
Most of the great chefs
today are men.

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:35.147
- Many.
- How do you know that?

01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:37.383
I looked it up online.

01:17:37.385 --> 01:17:39.919
- Yeah.
- Stay out of this.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.588
I think, if this little punk
wants to go to Tibet,

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:45.257
then Ziggy should do whatever
he wants with that money.

01:17:45.259 --> 01:17:46.960
Punk?

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:49.264
You don't want to work
at the garage anymore?

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.233
Do you want to study...

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:57.005
cooking?

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.809
Cat got your tongue?

01:18:05.046 --> 01:18:07.147
You turned my oldest son
against me.

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.348
No, Dad. It's what I want.

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:10.816
It's my idea.
Mom's just trying to help.

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:12.317
Don't wait up for me.

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:52.194
I told you not
to wait up for me.

01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:58.062
You're drunk. Go to bed.

01:18:58.064 --> 01:19:00.598
Goddamn it, Agnes.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.804
You've forgotten how to listen.

01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:09.244
I never did you wrong.

01:19:10.711 --> 01:19:12.547
Ever.

01:19:14.748 --> 01:19:17.450
- This fucking puzzle.
- Louie!

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:19.018
Oh!

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.719
Jesus.

01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:22.256
Look at you.
What are you...?

01:19:23.591 --> 01:19:25.590
What's going on?

01:19:25.592 --> 01:19:28.259
Who's filling your head
with all these new ideas?

01:19:28.261 --> 01:19:31.229
Selling the land
and cooking school?

01:19:31.231 --> 01:19:32.866
- This fucking competition?
- Oh!

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.567
You know what my father
would have done

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.972
to my mother in this situation?

01:19:43.711 --> 01:19:46.081
I'm not my father.

01:19:47.747 --> 01:19:49.283
I'm not him.

01:20:37.497 --> 01:20:39.333
Surprise.

01:20:40.601 --> 01:20:43.671
To our last practice together.

01:20:45.972 --> 01:20:48.844
- To you.
- To you.

01:20:52.146 --> 01:20:56.248
To getting
all the wrong pieces right.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.583
Right.

01:20:57.585 --> 01:21:00.152
Oh, God, you're so beautiful.

01:21:01.788 --> 01:21:04.059
Anyway, let's start.

01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:21.807
We have an Easter egg hunt.

01:21:21.809 --> 01:21:24.376
Louie's family comes early,

01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:27.681
and all the women
from the Ladies Guild.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.453
What would happen
if you didn't go?

01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:36.054
I don't know.

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:37.759
Hmm.

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:44.897
People would still
show up, right?

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:48.233
And your husband
would have to entertain them.

01:21:48.235 --> 01:21:51.171
And maybe that
would be all right.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.909
I can't imagine it.

01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:02.080
Don't go.
Don't go to the party.

01:22:02.082 --> 01:22:04.385
Stay here. Stay here.

01:22:05.552 --> 01:22:07.085
Stay here.

01:22:07.087 --> 01:22:08.889
I can't stay.

01:22:13.594 --> 01:22:15.329
I know.

01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:26.938
Oh, God.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.741
What time is it?

01:23:00.641 --> 01:23:02.273
Look, I, uh...

01:23:02.275 --> 01:23:05.311
Please don't make
any excuses, Ag.

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.948
Please.

01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:12.985
I know you weren't with Emily.

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:15.286
I called her.

01:23:15.288 --> 01:23:16.988
And Ronnie was here earlier.

01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:20.060
He said he saw you at the
train station the other day.

01:23:21.762 --> 01:23:23.995
I... I got stuck. I, uh...

01:23:23.997 --> 01:23:25.164
Please don't lie to me.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.202
Just don't lie to me, okay?

01:23:31.972 --> 01:23:33.673
You gotta tell me, Agnes.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:36.375
You gotta tell me everything.

01:23:36.377 --> 01:23:39.812
I don't have to tell you
anything.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.847
I'm not your servant.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:43.985
You don't own me.

01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:54.228
Are you having an affair?

01:24:03.436 --> 01:24:05.271
Yes, I am.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.740
I think.

01:24:10.677 --> 01:24:13.245
You think
you're having an affair?

01:24:13.247 --> 01:24:16.815
I have a puzzle partner.

01:24:16.817 --> 01:24:18.884
He's a man.

01:24:18.886 --> 01:24:20.553
We are a team.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.723
Uh, we're competing as a team.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:28.427
We've had sex one time,

01:24:28.429 --> 01:24:31.533
and it wasn't good,
but it wasn't bad.

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:44.378
Can you say something?

01:25:05.565 --> 01:25:09.768
We began our celebration today
with a service of light,

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:13.371
which represents Jesus Christ
rising from the dead

01:25:13.373 --> 01:25:15.107
and bringing light unto us.

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:17.442
Christ's light
has shone in the world,

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:19.777
scattering darkness forever.

01:25:19.779 --> 01:25:23.115
We had been waiting for
this moment from the beginning.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:25.418
We heard in our readings today

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.421
an account of the creation
of man and woman.

01:25:29.423 --> 01:25:34.059
This was in God's eternal plan
for humankind.

01:25:34.061 --> 01:25:37.295
But the high point
is the resurrection.

01:25:37.297 --> 01:25:41.267
It is God's greatest gift
to God's church.

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:44.436
And this is the most
blessed of days,

01:25:44.438 --> 01:25:48.109
as we heard in the Exultet,
the Easter Proclamation.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:53.745
Hey, uh, I'm gonna go
to the garage, do some work.

01:25:53.747 --> 01:25:55.880
Do you want a ride?

01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:57.652
No, I'm good.

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:16.501
What are you doing up already?

01:26:16.503 --> 01:26:18.238
What does it look like?

01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:22.507
I was gonna do that.

01:26:22.509 --> 01:26:24.710
Yeah, well, today I'm doing it.

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.648
You can relax.

01:26:28.215 --> 01:26:29.949
It's your big day.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.921
You need to save your energy
for lifting puzzle pieces.

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.620
It's really good.

01:26:36.622 --> 01:26:38.223
Yeah, it's the truffle oil.

01:26:38.225 --> 01:26:41.059
Isn't that chocolate?

01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:42.863
- No, it's mushrooms.
- Whatever.

01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:45.530
Hey, Mom.

01:26:45.532 --> 01:26:47.665
I really think
you're gonna win this thing.

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:50.302
Yeah. Bring home the trophy.

01:26:50.304 --> 01:26:52.170
All right, puzzlers,

01:26:52.172 --> 01:26:53.604
- this is it.
- Yes!

01:26:53.606 --> 01:26:56.441
The moment of truth is upon us.

01:26:56.443 --> 01:26:57.675
Ready?

01:26:57.677 --> 01:26:59.844
On my count.

01:26:59.846 --> 01:27:03.115
Five. Four. Three.

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:05.150
- Two. One.
- Here we go!

01:27:05.152 --> 01:27:07.352
Begin.

01:27:43.957 --> 01:27:46.791
What are you doing?
Stand up.

01:27:46.793 --> 01:27:49.928
Remember, it's important
to step away and take a look?

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:52.233
Shh. I'm working.

01:28:02.609 --> 01:28:06.010
Okay, almost halfway.

01:28:06.012 --> 01:28:09.013
You're not doing it by color.

01:28:09.015 --> 01:28:10.950
You're doing it the old way.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.750
What are you doing?

01:28:12.752 --> 01:28:14.585
Everyone else
is doing colors and borders.

01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:16.021
Yeah, that's how we trained.

01:28:16.023 --> 01:28:18.057
If we do it that way,
we won't win.

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.424
We'll come second or third.
I'm doing it the old way.

01:28:20.426 --> 01:28:21.927
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:25.129
If we argue about this,
we definitely won't win.

01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:27.465
You're a goddamn rebel.

01:28:27.467 --> 01:28:29.871
A rebel is what you are.

01:28:37.511 --> 01:28:40.111
Hello. Is this an emergency?

01:28:40.113 --> 01:28:42.180
Yes. Hi.

01:28:42.182 --> 01:28:44.648
What happened?

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:45.918
I won.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.686
- What? Hey! She won!
- She won!

01:28:47.688 --> 01:28:49.254
She won? That's awesome!

01:28:49.256 --> 01:28:51.156
You're so good!

01:28:51.158 --> 01:28:52.458
Congratulations.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.492
I left a roasted chicken
in the fridge.

01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:56.161
You can just heat it up
with some...

01:28:56.163 --> 01:28:57.662
What?
Mom, don't worry about it.

01:28:57.664 --> 01:29:00.001
We can, uh...
we can take care of ourselves.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.605
Okay.

01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.606
I love you, sweetie.

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:09.711
Do you want to talk to Dad?

01:29:11.144 --> 01:29:12.443
No.

01:29:12.445 --> 01:29:14.079
- No, that's okay.
- All right.

01:29:14.081 --> 01:29:15.280
Congratulations, Mom.

01:29:15.282 --> 01:29:16.415
Proud of you, Mom.

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:17.749
Love you.

01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:19.454
Thank you.

01:29:20.587 --> 01:29:22.187
Bye.

01:29:26.193 --> 01:29:27.459
Hello? Knock, knock.

01:29:27.461 --> 01:29:28.893
Mata, are you in there?

01:29:28.895 --> 01:29:30.629
I need your date of birth.

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.231
What for?

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:34.967
I'm on the phone
booking tickets to Brussels.

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:37.468
Do you have a frequent-flier
number with American, Mata?

01:30:04.163 --> 01:30:05.565
What happened?

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:08.733
Did you get a splinter
or something?

01:30:08.735 --> 01:30:11.035
Oh, it hurts!

01:30:11.037 --> 01:30:13.206
Here, let me see.

01:30:18.145 --> 01:30:20.312
Yeah, that's a piece of glass.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.180
- It's tiny.
- Don't!

01:30:22.182 --> 01:30:24.551
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:30:25.851 --> 01:30:28.620
I think it's the last piece.

01:30:28.622 --> 01:30:31.055
Of what?

01:30:31.057 --> 01:30:33.293
Of the plate you broke.

01:30:39.065 --> 01:30:40.768
Come here. Let me see it.

01:30:42.135 --> 01:30:44.135
Okay.

01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:46.071
Just tell me
if this hurts, okay?

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.938
Oh, man.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:50.110
Does that hurt?

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.745
All right.
It's almost there.

01:30:53.747 --> 01:30:55.347
Okay. You ready?

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:56.514
For what?

01:30:56.516 --> 01:30:58.217
I'm gonna pull it out.

01:30:58.219 --> 01:31:00.121
It might hurt, okay?

01:31:02.922 --> 01:31:04.257
Are you ready?

01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:09.330
Okay.

01:32:11.992 --> 01:32:13.860
I'm gonna miss this place.

01:32:16.262 --> 01:32:19.763
I remember the day your dad
came home and said,

01:32:19.765 --> 01:32:21.299
"Guess what.

01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:24.102
"I bought a piece of land.

01:32:24.104 --> 01:32:27.004
"There's a cabin, a lake.

01:32:27.006 --> 01:32:29.008
"We'll never have
to think about

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:31.242
where to go on vacation
ever again."

01:32:31.244 --> 01:32:34.012
So that's why
we never went anywhere.

01:32:34.014 --> 01:32:36.580
It's ironic.

01:32:36.582 --> 01:32:41.186
We had a place to go,
so we never went anywhere.

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:44.388
And now we don't have
a place to go,

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:46.758
we'll have to go somewhere.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.093
Do something.

01:32:49.095 --> 01:32:52.399
Be something or someone.

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:58.169
I don't really know what
you're talking about, Mom.

01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:03.543
Is this about you and Dad?

01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:47.085
Hey. Are you all packed?

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:48.653
I'm with my family.

01:33:48.655 --> 01:33:50.388
Mata, you have to get
to the airport

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:53.325
at least three hours early
for an international flight.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:55.326
You have to be here
around 1:00.

01:33:55.328 --> 01:33:58.463
Security is going
to take forever.

01:33:58.465 --> 01:34:02.136
Uh, did you tell Louie?

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.740
I'm not coming.

01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:12.112
Mata...

01:34:14.247 --> 01:34:16.548
Please...

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:18.215
don't...

01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:20.621
don't do this to me.

01:34:25.658 --> 01:34:27.694
I love you.

01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:33.764
I miss you.

01:34:33.766 --> 01:34:35.568
I'm sorry.

01:34:39.139 --> 01:34:40.975
I love you, too.

01:34:42.509 --> 01:34:44.345
I miss you, too.
