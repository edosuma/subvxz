WEBVTT

01:36.638 --> 01:40.222
It's just like the paperwork says.
Read the report.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.620
Well, our feeling is that
the prosecution

01:42.644 --> 01:46.058
didn't make a full accounting
or mount a suitable case.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.935
So we have to do that now.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.982
Get the full accounting.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.451
Around the end of the first week,
family got the note.

02:10.172 --> 02:14.633
Envelope's handwritten.
So, this isn't a brainiac.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.927
Processing stamp's
from a post office in Farmington.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.630
That could have been dropped
in any mailbox.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.841
We're putting men out there
to canvass.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.186
You see this?

02:28.398 --> 02:31.038
Twiggs said they've been
fielding calls from Martians all day.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.567
What's the Ozark Children's Outreach?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.770
Some charity.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.356
You think it's true?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.191
Girl's alive?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.369
I think she is.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.580
What were you focusing on prior?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.336
Neighborhood surveillance.
Like it says in the report.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.459
Right, yeah. Uh...

02:54.549 --> 02:57.337
"All day." Mmm-hmm.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.261
But you guys didn't get to the house
till after everybody else.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.304
I mean, you'd have got there first

03:02.391 --> 03:04.191
if you were in the neighborhood,
wouldn't you?

03:04.226 --> 03:08.140
Well, might've taken
the call late or...

03:08.230 --> 03:10.563
I'm a little fuzzy.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.566
Wayne probably has a better memory.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.862
The picture doesn't show anything new.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.567
Nothing that suggests a blackout,
and that's good.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.118
Since your CT scan looks clean,

03:24.204 --> 03:25.640
I think the concern
right now is the need

03:25.664 --> 03:27.656
to adjust your lifestyle
to what's happening.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.956
I wasn't...

03:30.419 --> 03:31.660
He explained it wrong.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.382
Didn't drive in my sleep
or any kind of "state."

03:38.343 --> 03:39.629
I mean...

03:40.679 --> 03:42.921
<i>At the time, I...</i>

03:43.765 --> 03:47.554
I believe I did know what I was doing.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.010
It's only I forgot later.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.393
We're just gonna have to do
some things differently. Okay, Dad?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.475
I went up there for a reason.
I just can't remember.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.061
It's not like I'm losing it.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.364
Do you remember
the rest of dinner at my place?

04:02.117 --> 04:03.483
Remember me driving you home?

04:04.202 --> 04:05.202
Yeah.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.328
Heather drove you home.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.327
Now we're playing "gotcha."

04:10.417 --> 04:12.659
Mr. Hays, your son loves you.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.790
Our only concern
is for your well-being.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.837
I know my son loves me, Doctor.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.165
But thanks for
walking me through that.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.928
The place you found yourself.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.139
Do you know why you might
have wanted to go there?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.393
Does it have any significance?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.938
Yeah. It did.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.890
He did a couple interviews
for this show.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.024
Been talking about an old case
took place out there.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.695
- What, you ratting on me?
- What, are you working a case?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.108
It was never fully solved.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.569
People don't remember being babies.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.951
It's good we get to revisit this stage
at the end.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.748
Mr. Hays, believe me,

04:52.834 --> 04:55.417
I can understand your frustration
with the disease.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.996
A disease
you can't even say what it is.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.752
We can say what it
almost certainly is.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.057
I told you.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.564
You try putting me in a home,
I'll off myself.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.230
Put it out your head.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.115
Don't you want to know?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.581
You do.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.871
And she needs help, doesn't she?

05:40.841 --> 05:41.957
Julie.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.717
Yeah.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.598
You know, it was just a case
when I caught it.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.019
I didn't know it'd be my last.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.771
You with the book these last years...

06:04.114 --> 06:09.200
I feel like I'm tired of this thing
being in our lives.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.530
Like when we met.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.290
I mean, Saturday night,
your mom's got the kids,

06:22.424 --> 06:25.041
got this thing sitting between us.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.010
So what do you want to do?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.226
I don't know.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.932
There was a motel back there.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.187
We could just drink
and have sex all night.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.030
Boy, that'd be great.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.746
Alan said so far
they have her prints on the counter

06:59.836 --> 07:01.919
and some shelves in the main area.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.585
Were there any behind the pharmacy?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.133
He didn't know. Sallisaw PD's got it.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.176
Well, shouldn't you talk to them?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.552
May come back on me.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.636
It's not like if they check,
someone's gonna have my back.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.726
What if I talk to them?

07:25.528 --> 07:26.814
Sallisaw.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.445
An author with a book about the case.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.527
I have galleys, I'm legitimate,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.237
I bet I could get them
to share with me.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.448
- I doubt it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.498
I'll get done up,

07:40.585 --> 07:43.043
bookish but sexy,

07:43.129 --> 07:45.712
intimidated by those big, tough cops.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.711
This is, like

07:47.801 --> 07:49.793
Afro <i>Hart to Hart?</i> That it?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.923
Come on.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.353
Wanna use the pay phone,
we're here? Check on the kids?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.645
Why don't I call from the motel?

08:25.964 --> 08:27.626
We need to walk it back.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.591
Re-examine it all.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.299
It's like a thing's
staring right at us.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.722
Got that feeling myself.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.601
The Purcells.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.172
Said they were gonna play
with their neighbor,

08:50.196 --> 08:52.984
- the Boyle kid.
- Yeah?

08:53.074 --> 08:55.782
But he said
they didn't have any plans.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.533
Why would the Purcell kids
lie about meeting the Boyle kid?

09:03.626 --> 09:06.994
What were they up to?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.375
What were they really doing?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.253
Back to the kids.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.334
Talk to the parents again,

09:13.428 --> 09:16.216
the Boyle kid, any others knew them.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.974
Go back through the house
again, right?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.098
Yeah, right on.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.440
That's good, man.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.569
Get that teacher
to help with the kids.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.161
<i>Wayne had the idea them kids
would tell him stories.</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:42.954
And he was correct.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.334
You all fucked a good detective there.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.412
You know that, right?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.247
I wouldn't argue with you.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.628
But it wasn't me.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.177
Probably didn't even give you shit
for it, when you saw him?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.505
I can't say he did, no.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.102
Purple Hays. My man.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.816
Tried to get him transferred
over here twice, you know?

10:10.902 --> 10:14.521
Blocked both times
by the major's office.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.571
Told me not to ask again.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.615
Feels like we should stay on point.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.991
I'm making a point, son.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.458
You played with
Will and Julie a lot, huh?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.585
Hmm... Not really. I mean,

10:33.675 --> 10:37.009
I hung out with Will
at school a little.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.338
But y'all hung out after school.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.764
His dad said y'all
played after school.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.561
No, sir. We didn't play much.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.309
I mean, I told him
he could come over sometime

10:49.399 --> 10:51.766
to see the new puppy, but that's it.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.273
He's home after school.
Or at basketball now.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.944
He don't go out playing much.

11:02.412 --> 11:06.247
You said they played a lot,
that neighbor, Ronnie Boyle?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.083
Yeah, well,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.287
three, four times a week.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.712
They're best friends.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.256
Did Ronnie ever come over here
to the house?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.130
Did you ever see him
when the kids get together?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.552
No.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.764
I guess not.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.092
I mean, I know him and his parents
from school.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.473
And they'd go over to his place.

11:28.563 --> 11:32.728
Well, actually, looks like
they didn't really play together.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.312
What is this...

11:35.403 --> 11:38.146
What's this mean?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.822
Why aren't you out there
looking for her?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.617
That's where she is.
Out there. She's alive.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.695
The letter said she's out there.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.745
Feds are running
a wide search, Mr. Purcell,

11:47.832 --> 11:49.448
and they have a lot more manpower.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.623
We're just trying to focus
on what's personal.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.955
Would you folks be all right

11:56.049 --> 11:59.292
if we started going back
through some of their things?

11:59.385 --> 12:03.470
We're afraid now
we might've overlooked something.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.551
What?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.385
We just don't know, ma'am.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.076
We'll process this stuff,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.953
get it back to you.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.497
Don't lose it, okay?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.499
We won't.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.915
Say, one of you used
to work at Hoyt Foods?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.378
Yeah, I did.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.714
On the chicken line.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.218
Quit a year or two ago.

14:11.309 --> 14:15.724
Make better money in tips
at the Sawhorse.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.020
Why?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.226
Just asking.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.059
Thank you, now.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.703
So Wayne opened up
that the kids weren't doing

14:36.793 --> 14:38.455
what they said they were.

14:38.544 --> 14:43.164
With that big reward,
brought everybody out the woodwork.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.998
You see Wayne much anymore?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.377
Not at all, really.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.509
And I don't know why.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.966
No hard feelings, though?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.427
Not between him and me.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.934
We were good friends, as I see it.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.934
I think it was

15:04.028 --> 15:06.771
once we stopped working together,

15:06.864 --> 15:09.151
we just stopped.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.744
Sometimes it's like that with people.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.875
Dad, can I get a Transformer?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.203
No.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.288
Can we get something
from the toys, Dad?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.465
- If it's cheap?
- No.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.292
Where the hell's the charcoal?

15:28.386 --> 15:31.049
- How about if it's only a dollar?
- No.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.426
Stores aren't supposed to be this big.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.099
Can we at least go look at the toys?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.723
No. You guys have to stay with me.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.183
So we're trying to update the book,
if possible.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.735
Hearing about her prints
at the drugstore,

15:46.821 --> 15:48.608
it's very significant.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.031
How'd you hear about that?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.904
My ex-husband.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.782
He's a cop in Arkansas.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.240
Always had a thing for cops, I guess.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.294
We got a few partials
and a lot of fulls.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.121
We verified it
with the state crime lab.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.922
It's definitely a match.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.844
Were any of her prints
found behind the pharmacy?

16:12.930 --> 16:17.675
No. But we didn't get
to keep working the scene, neither.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.100
End of the day,

16:19.187 --> 16:21.850
store just wanted
to get back to business.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.307
- So hers were just the shelves.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.144
We only focused on the robbery,
and that was months ago.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.568
I'm about to clock out.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.071
You wanna grab a bite?
We can talk more about it?

16:46.631 --> 16:47.917
All right.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.470
Hey, I think we're done.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.813
That was awful, right?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.392
Since you guys were so good,
I'll let you get one thing.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.728
- Yes!
- Feel better, sad guy?

17:14.075 --> 17:16.317
Where's your sister?

17:16.410 --> 17:19.198
She was right behind me. I don't know.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.037
Come on.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.583
- Becca!
- Becca!

17:25.670 --> 17:27.002
Becca!

17:40.560 --> 17:41.926
Becca!

17:42.019 --> 17:44.306
Becca! Becca!

17:45.356 --> 17:48.190
Becca! Becca!

17:48.276 --> 17:49.878
<i>...please come to customer service.</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:52.485
<i>Look for the nearest
Wal-Mart representative</i>

17:52.572 --> 17:55.189
<i>and ask them to bring you
to customer service.</i>

17:55.283 --> 17:56.444
<i>Rebecca Hays.</i>

17:56.534 --> 17:59.572
It's been 10 minutes.
Need to lock down the store.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.529
Shut all the doors, nobody in or out.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.831
Listen to me. I'm a cop. State Police.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.285
Lock down the store now. I'll make
an announcement, give me the mic.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.665
Sir, I don't think that you...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.121
- Give me the mic!
- Hi.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.675
- Where were you?
- I don't know.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.844
They were giving out chips
in one place,

18:17.930 --> 18:20.138
and I stopped to eat some,
and y'all were gone.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.261
God damn it, you can't do that!
You hear me?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.889
Don't fucking do that, Rebecca!

18:32.028 --> 18:34.611
Okay. Okay.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.279
Let's go. Let's just go home.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.002
We were happy to help.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.554
Especially once we heard
she was a former employee of ours.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.725
Just, it led to a lot of false tips.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.848
You know, it's better
to coordinate this kind of thing

19:07.938 --> 19:09.600
between our offices.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.522
But we did.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.602
The board cleared it with
the county prosecutor's office.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.408
I don't see any pictures of you all
putting up rewards for anybody.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.157
Up till now, we've tended
to help families

19:24.246 --> 19:26.989
with children that needed
medical treatment.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.292
But with it all over the news,
and knowing the mother

19:30.378 --> 19:32.620
used to be in our family of workers,

19:32.713 --> 19:34.500
the board voted to contribute.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.465
When did this outreach start?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.172
Mr. Hoyt endowed the foundation

19:40.262 --> 19:43.005
after they lost their granddaughter
a couple of years ago.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.508
Mother worked on the chicken line.
Where's that building?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.389
Oh. Let's see.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.809
It would be one

19:51.899 --> 19:53.561
of those two.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.811
You know what would help?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.362
Names and dates of hire

19:59.448 --> 20:01.940
for every employee
that works at this plant.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.822
That's nearly 700 people.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.370
Faster we get them back, the better.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.740
All right. Sure. Of course.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.952
We'll start getting it together
right now.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.504
And the big man, Mr. Hoyt,
he ever here?

20:16.590 --> 20:21.051
Well, hardly, no. Mr. Hoyt's
been in Africa since mid-October.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.880
- Safari.
- Oh, yeah?

20:23.973 --> 20:26.511
My partner's
a bit of a hunter himself.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.525
State PD. Task Force.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.398
Uh-huh.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.407
The girl's being held
at a snake farm in Huntsville?

21:28.245 --> 21:30.612
And how do you know this, ma'am?

21:33.751 --> 21:35.788
Listen, we closed right now,

21:35.878 --> 21:38.791
but do me a favor,
call back in the morning.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.292
This number,

21:40.382 --> 21:42.339
and ask for Agents Bowen or Diller.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.258
FBI.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.179
Tell them what you're telling me.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.723
All right, now.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.476
Lady seen Julie Purcell in a dream.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.726
She say her dreams always come true.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.366
All this stuff's about that game.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.819
Couldn't find his dice,

22:12.164 --> 22:13.450
but I'm not seeing anything.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.704
Except he played a lot,

22:20.798 --> 22:23.882
and them other kids
didn't play with him, huh?

22:38.315 --> 22:41.308
Who gave Julie the doll,
met them in the woods?

22:41.402 --> 22:43.234
Who played the game with Will?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.936
Where'd they go after school?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.738
They were meant to be
with that neighbor.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.817
So what was your next move?

22:52.663 --> 22:56.077
Shut down the park,
except for search parties.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.876
<i>They were still doing them
every day. Mostly volunteer.</i>

22:59.962 --> 23:02.830
<i>State park's about 2,500 acres.</i>

23:03.966 --> 23:06.333
So, how does it work?

23:06.427 --> 23:09.090
Spot patterns.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.760
Disturbance, flattening.

23:12.850 --> 23:16.139
It's there, you just
have to look for it.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.221
Bent grass, compressed ground.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.609
You tracked men in the war?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.897
I did.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.401
Did you march?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.615
I did.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.826
Funny how the protests stopped
once the draft ended.

23:49.762 --> 23:53.301
Hey, that poem you were teaching...

23:53.390 --> 23:56.554
Yeah. You had some thoughts about it?

23:58.896 --> 24:01.934
He says you call the story "Time,"

24:02.024 --> 24:04.937
but you can't say its name.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.609
Why is that?

24:08.989 --> 24:11.072
I think it's because

24:11.158 --> 24:15.243
we're in time and of time,

24:17.247 --> 24:18.738
but to name...

24:20.584 --> 24:23.668
You separate yourself from
something when you name it,

24:23.754 --> 24:28.340
and I think he means
we can't be separated from time.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.218
Ah.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.755
I thought he meant
it was like the name of God.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.518
You know, how the Hebrews
weren't supposed to say God's name.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.398
Huh.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.756
Think maybe we should
have dinner sometime?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.897
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:25.983 --> 25:29.226
Those Sallisaw boys
couldn't stop telling me stuff.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.481
I was pretty tremendous.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.438
I think I have a future at this.

25:35.409 --> 25:39.904
- You're reading it! Finally.
- Not really.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.073
Keep seeing my name.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.289
Are you drunk?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.628
No, I'm...

25:53.719 --> 25:55.836
I had a drink at dinner.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.888
This detective took me out to eat.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.011
- Ah, terrific.
- No, actually,

26:01.101 --> 26:03.639
I got a lot of info from him.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.641
Listen, her fingerprints were found

26:05.731 --> 26:07.597
just on the shelves
in the cosmetics aisle.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.434
Looks like she was
probably a customer.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.564
They had the prior week's
surveillance footage.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.896
I think they're gonna let me
take a look at it.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.528
I didn't get any of the shit you want.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.359
At Wal-Mart.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.407
Okay.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.245
Did something happen?

26:26.335 --> 26:29.578
- Are the kids all right?
- The kids are fine.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.663
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.467
But one thing. One favor.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.795
Do not come bouncing in here,
half in the bag,

26:38.889 --> 26:41.097
all giddy about this shit.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.674
Can you do that?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.384
Can you summon the mental resolve

26:44.478 --> 26:46.390
to shut up about this shit with me?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.148
If you feel this way,

26:50.234 --> 26:51.711
you don't have to talk
to me like that.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.227
- You could just tell me.
- You've been told.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.655
Why don't you go check on your kids
since you haven't seen them all day.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.575
- They're supposed to be in bed.
- Fuck off.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.368
I'm with them five times
the amount you are

27:02.454 --> 27:04.537
for a job that treats you like shit.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.285
I don't really feel
like trading curses.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.661
I said my piece.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.745
I'm not gonna stop, Wayne.

30:08.765 --> 30:12.850
Patrol's got the scene.
Forensics is on the way.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.768
That's where the boy died.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.812
Somebody carried him to the cave.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.936
The office checked the field reports.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.360
Nobody talked to this guy.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.029
And the farm road's not on our maps.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.285
I already talked to your people.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.416
Man came here the next day.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.623
What man?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.800
Was he police? Sheriff's?

30:45.886 --> 30:49.505
Man in a suit. Showed me a badge.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.635
Asked me about those missing kids,

30:51.725 --> 30:53.512
if I'd seen anything.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.843
Can you describe him?

30:57.606 --> 31:01.976
A normal guy. White. A suit.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.810
Showed me a badge.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.735
What'd you tell him?
Did you see anything?

31:07.824 --> 31:11.113
I told him I seen those kids before.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.819
Two or three times.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.951
They come down my road
and into the woods.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.829
Couple afternoons I seen them.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.878
- You see anybody else?
- Yeah.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.001
Told him I seen a car
out here a couple times.

31:25.092 --> 31:28.756
Nice one. Brown. Man and woman.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.508
But it wasn't the same day.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.341
What'd they look like?
The man and woman.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.845
Like y'all.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.973
Black and white.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.180
Man was Negro.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.230
I couldn't see faces.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.442
Now, most times,

31:45.529 --> 31:47.646
you gotta be looking for our place,

31:48.824 --> 31:51.441
but sometimes people come out here.

31:51.535 --> 31:52.992
Sir?

31:53.078 --> 31:55.536
You mind we search your property?

31:56.540 --> 31:57.997
Yes, sir, I mind.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.492
Don't you need a warrant
for something like that?

32:02.838 --> 32:04.830
If you make us get one.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.669
I think you'll have to, son.

32:10.387 --> 32:13.721
Can I ask, do you feel
there was sufficient coverage

32:13.807 --> 32:16.424
of the neighborhood
during the canvassing?

32:16.518 --> 32:18.180
Yes, I do.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.728
We brought whatever we had.

32:23.233 --> 32:27.022
General rule is, you start close,
then work your way out.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.980
Did officers conduct
multiple interviews

32:30.073 --> 32:33.111
- with all potential witnesses?
- Yes. Mmm-hmm.

32:33.201 --> 32:36.535
And I feel like, honestly,

32:37.205 --> 32:39.117
everyone was giving
everything they had.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.166
Well, we have people who say they were
never questioned by the police,

32:42.252 --> 32:45.916
although they remember
the officers going door to door.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.376
Hmm.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.044
I don't know.

32:53.138 --> 32:56.677
If anyone got overlooked,
it was a mistake.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.554
We had over 100
law enforcement officers out there.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.637
Some residents
did get talked to three or four times.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.814
But nobody spoke to these people.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.894
And we found two who both
separately claim to have witnessed

33:08.987 --> 33:12.401
a very nice brown sedan
driving around the neighborhoods,

33:12.491 --> 33:15.700
and later, away from Devil's Den
on the day of the murder.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.117
Brown sedan?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.019
A witness said police
talked to him once,

33:23.043 --> 33:26.127
and he told them about the car,
but they never came back.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.956
And there's no mention of the sedan
in the field reports.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.257
Another said police
never took a statement,

33:31.343 --> 33:34.711
but they both noticed the car
because it was new and upscale,

33:34.804 --> 33:36.796
and that was unusual for the area.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.803
And that the vehicle
kept driving around.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.559
Treads.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.149
I remember. Treads.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.569
Another former resident,
Charles Snyder,

33:51.655 --> 33:54.648
said two weeks before,
he reported that his boy and a friend

33:54.741 --> 33:57.700
had told of a black man
with a scar, in a suit,

33:57.786 --> 34:00.699
at the cul-de-sac where the kids
played near Devil's Den.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.953
No one ever came back to question him.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.661
None of this is mentioned
in the official reports.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.672
This alone, don't you think,
points to serious flaws

34:16.763 --> 34:18.971
in the investigation
from the beginning?

34:23.143 --> 34:25.010
What's going on?

34:25.105 --> 34:26.471
Really.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.851
You have some new evidence?

34:28.942 --> 34:31.400
Are you looking for Julie?
You find something?

34:31.485 --> 34:33.547
- That's enough for today.
- No, I'm all right.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.188
- I think we're doing well.
- I'm sure you do.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.321
You see his distress?
This man is ill, Elisa.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.572
- Henry...
- That is enough.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.539
For today.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.677
Over there.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.221
Other side of the tree line.

35:01.308 --> 35:04.051
It's hard to find. Kind of hidden.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.056
That's where they played.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.638
Now,
we need to process these toys.

35:08.982 --> 35:12.191
You bag the toys, but we need pictures
to show the parents.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.892
Hey.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.941
Get up.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.739
What's going on?

36:00.825 --> 36:02.817
What are you doing,
skulking around here?

36:02.911 --> 36:03.911
What...

36:05.997 --> 36:08.114
We got kids playing out here,

36:08.208 --> 36:10.416
and we don't need you
lurking around them.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.772
My kids and two others
say you keep coming around that field

36:12.796 --> 36:14.128
where they all play.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.503
What are you coming around
the kids for?

36:18.009 --> 36:19.420
I'm not.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.218
I don't.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.421
- I have kids.
- No, you don't.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.882
And we don't want you around,
you hear?

36:25.975 --> 36:28.513
I live here! I have rights!

36:28.603 --> 36:32.313
I fought for your fucking rights,
you asshole...

36:35.652 --> 36:37.439
You're a goddamn bum.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.065
You stay away from these kids.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.817
And stay out of
our neighborhood!

36:54.629 --> 36:56.746
You hear me now, boy?

36:56.840 --> 37:00.049
You don't come around here no more.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.218
We don't see you,

37:02.303 --> 37:06.923
and God help you if you talk
to another child out here.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.075
Get the fuck out of here!

38:27.806 --> 38:29.923
So how's life in charge?

38:31.726 --> 38:33.809
It's got its good and bad.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.816
You talked to them? Alan's firm?

38:41.236 --> 38:43.444
Yeah, they approached me.

38:44.614 --> 38:47.652
The guy's kids hired them, he said.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.363
But you support it?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.069
Reopening it?

38:55.750 --> 38:58.413
They tell you about the fingerprints?

38:59.087 --> 39:00.453
Yeah.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.714
You have any idea
what that means to me?

39:05.593 --> 39:07.835
I have to imagine,

39:07.929 --> 39:09.420
but, yes, sir.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.594
You know, I...

39:17.689 --> 39:19.305
I think of Lucy.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.854
I wish she was still around
to hear this.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.521
Two years ago now.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.905
Alan had her file.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.361
I had the body brought back
from Vegas.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.990
What about you?

39:38.668 --> 39:40.876
How you doing with all this now?

39:42.171 --> 39:44.709
I'm still sober.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.665
Five years.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.001
I know.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.929
I'm proud of you, man.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.304
So I got my Higher Power,

39:55.393 --> 39:59.182
and he's putting this
in front of me now.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.520
Cream and extra sugar, still?

40:04.986 --> 40:07.569
Yes, sir. Like a dessert.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.777
How about the other one?

40:10.867 --> 40:13.450
Your partner. He still around?

40:15.705 --> 40:17.071
He's on the job.

40:18.207 --> 40:21.200
Hasn't been in major crimes
in a long time.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.794
Anyways, yeah, me and him

40:28.760 --> 40:30.217
kind of lost touch.

40:32.221 --> 40:36.340
You didn't have to check on me,
Lieutenant West.

40:36.726 --> 40:40.470
You've done more for me
than just about anybody.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.273
Pulled me out of that hole
five years ago.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.600
No.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.776
You done good.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.998
Can I ask you for something?

41:03.378 --> 41:05.415
You can ask.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.331
Would you pray with me?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.091
God,

41:20.520 --> 41:22.386
save me from anger.

41:23.856 --> 41:28.146
God, save me from resentment.

41:30.363 --> 41:34.573
God, save me from my judgments
and prophecies,

41:35.868 --> 41:39.077
my need to control.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.700
I have known you
by the hawk and the dove

41:46.212 --> 41:49.125
and I live at
your infinite compassion.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.965
Lord,

41:52.677 --> 41:55.294
<i>guard what I hold dear,</i>

41:55.388 --> 41:58.722
<i>and let me never hold too dearly</i>

41:58.808 --> 42:00.891
<i>anything of this world.</i>

42:02.061 --> 42:03.097
<i>Amen.</i>

42:10.570 --> 42:12.482
Brown sedan.

42:14.574 --> 42:17.112
Farmer talked about

42:17.201 --> 42:19.409
a brown sedan,

42:19.495 --> 42:21.077
'80...

42:23.708 --> 42:25.244
We knew.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.706
Was that who they played with?

42:36.804 --> 42:39.888
She wrote a bit about
how the games we found

42:41.267 --> 42:44.431
got people worried that
kids were getting killed

42:44.520 --> 42:46.352
playing this stuff

42:48.441 --> 42:50.433
or something.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.605
Henry was

42:55.698 --> 42:58.611
five or six, I think,
when she started writing.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.408
Becca would have been

43:01.746 --> 43:03.408
three or four.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.253
<i>Scientists now theorize</i>

43:15.343 --> 43:17.881
<i>an infinite number
of dimensions outside our own.</i>

43:20.098 --> 43:23.887
<i>Einstein said past, present and future</i>

43:24.560 --> 43:27.428
<i>are all a stubbornly
persistent illusion.</i>

43:30.483 --> 43:31.849
Oh...

43:31.943 --> 43:33.775
Oh, God.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.524
And are you waking up
to that illusion?

43:37.615 --> 43:40.699
Now, while things fall apart,

43:40.785 --> 43:43.072
are you starting to see them clearly?

43:44.330 --> 43:47.289
And at the end of all things,

43:47.375 --> 43:50.459
are you awakening
to what you withheld?

43:52.463 --> 43:55.922
Did you confuse reacting with feeling?

43:57.135 --> 44:01.004
Did you mistake
compulsion for freedom?

44:01.097 --> 44:03.840
Please, not like this.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.676
And even so,

44:07.770 --> 44:11.855
did you harden your heart
against what loved you most?

44:12.984 --> 44:17.274
Not like this.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.404
Oh, sweetheart.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.325
Did you think you could just go on

44:23.411 --> 44:26.119
and never once have to look back?

44:26.205 --> 44:30.290
Please, I...
I don't deserve this. I...

44:30.918 --> 44:33.331
Whatever's happening,
I don't deserve this.

44:33.421 --> 44:34.787
No, you don't.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.293
But it's happening anyway.

44:38.426 --> 44:39.792
I'm so sorry.

44:46.893 --> 44:48.850
Where is it? I...

44:51.314 --> 44:54.978
How much do I have to lose?

44:55.067 --> 44:57.104
Everything.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.982
Same as everybody else.

45:04.744 --> 45:06.656
I lost Becca.

45:06.746 --> 45:08.658
No, you didn't.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.122
Not the way you think.

45:16.839 --> 45:20.628
You're worried what they'll find.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.835
What you left in the woods.

45:27.391 --> 45:28.927
Finish it.

46:38.796 --> 46:41.539
Got a message, maybe the lieutenant
wanted to meet you.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.758
Moving up in the world.

47:19.754 --> 47:23.293
No. I don't recognize them.

47:25.426 --> 47:26.712
I think. I mean...

47:29.221 --> 47:31.759
I know I didn't buy any of these.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.053
Ma'am?

47:35.436 --> 47:37.143
I don't think so.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.729
I don't really remember.

47:39.815 --> 47:41.772
I'm the one bought them toys.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.067
I don't recognize any of those.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.190
This about the reward?

47:50.284 --> 47:52.446
Someone called us.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.573
What's it have to do with?

47:57.666 --> 47:59.783
Where'd you find these?

48:01.462 --> 48:04.421
Looks like
the kids had this kind of

48:04.507 --> 48:06.715
play area hidden out in the forest.

48:08.094 --> 48:10.131
Found these toys there.

48:10.221 --> 48:12.133
They could be anybody's.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.014
Had the kids' prints on them.

48:17.019 --> 48:19.386
Another set of prints we can't ID.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.806
And more of those straw dolls.

48:23.984 --> 48:26.317
They were meeting somebody?

48:26.404 --> 48:28.771
Like some adult?

48:28.864 --> 48:31.277
Maybe. Yes, sir.

48:31.367 --> 48:32.699
What are these?

48:34.995 --> 48:36.486
We haven't seen this.

48:37.289 --> 48:39.952
It's an old baby album.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.829
He brought it out. I...

48:42.586 --> 48:44.373
I can't look at it.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.261
Roland?

49:09.780 --> 49:11.772
It's the same.

49:35.431 --> 49:37.514
What's this one from?

49:38.392 --> 49:41.135
That's Will's First Communion.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.850
He was 10.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.150
What?

49:56.160 --> 49:57.526
What?

50:23.395 --> 50:25.227
Purple Hays.

50:25.314 --> 50:27.522
How you been, killer?

50:30.444 --> 50:33.983
Just making my rounds.
Places I'm not wanted.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.863
- Dub SoCo.
- You served?

50:38.953 --> 50:41.741
- Every day of my life.
- Yeah? What war?

50:41.830 --> 50:45.198
Motherfucker, get me two fingers
of Southern Comfort.

50:45.292 --> 50:47.409
He's a lieutenant with State Police.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.339
Could've told him
you were fixing jeeps

50:57.429 --> 50:59.421
while the rest of us
was getting shot at.

50:59.515 --> 51:01.598
Could've slapped my dick
on the bar, too.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.219
Nine years, you're still
talking about your dick.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.804
Well, I don't mean to.

51:07.898 --> 51:10.185
It just keeps coming up.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.066
New task force.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.860
I'm in charge.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.740
Good for you, Lieutenant.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.082
Say,

51:33.132 --> 51:36.091
that promotion for merit

51:36.176 --> 51:38.543
or did it come with the pigmentation?

51:39.930 --> 51:43.549
Well, I think, unlike some others,
I lacked a big fucking mouth.

51:44.893 --> 51:49.103
Hell, with affirmative action,
you could've been my boss by now.

51:50.691 --> 51:53.934
Guess if I'd been
clumsy enough to get shot,

51:54.028 --> 51:56.441
I'd be playing golf most days

51:56.530 --> 51:58.988
and calling old buddies
like I'm doing them a favor.

52:01.869 --> 52:04.407
Guess you had a few before I got here.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.956
Could be avoiding home.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.626
I was gonna keep going, some race bit.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.006
You never been very funny.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.676
You feel like maybe
being a detective again?

52:31.940 --> 52:35.149
'Cause that, you were okay at.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.150
Purcell case?

52:40.240 --> 52:42.482
State's reopening it.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.076
They want me to steer.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.533
Look at you.

52:47.623 --> 52:49.956
Can't stop this rocket. Mmm-mmm.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.785
You wanna get back to work or not?

53:04.765 --> 53:05.765
I, uh...

53:07.476 --> 53:10.264
I'm sorry about the pigmentation line.

53:10.938 --> 53:12.850
No, you're not.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.723
Half sorry.
