WEBVTT

01:28.006 --> 01:29.924
You've reached Sheriff Bly.
I'm on a...

02:03.159 --> 02:04.827
Maggie? Is that you?

02:04.952 --> 02:06.078
Hi, Mom.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.497
I want to come home.

02:13.418 --> 02:14.878
Mom...

02:17.795 --> 02:20.090
I threw my Scrabble tiles away.

02:21.507 --> 02:24.010
You're always welcome
to come home, baby.

02:24.135 --> 02:26.803
As long as you agree
to stick to our terms.

02:29.139 --> 02:30.724
Mom, please.

02:31.307 --> 02:33.059
Weekly drug testing,

02:33.184 --> 02:35.018
no girls, church on Sunday...

03:12.799 --> 03:14.300
Where's Joe?

04:38.577 --> 04:39.911
Wake and bake?

04:42.079 --> 04:43.664
You must be feeling rough.

04:44.123 --> 04:46.792
Like I got run over by the Orca.

04:48.209 --> 04:52.171
You've been hitting it pretty hard.
I didn't think you had it in you.

04:53.339 --> 04:54.922
Yeah, well...

04:55.591 --> 04:57.092
people change.

04:58.509 --> 05:00.970
What, so the next time I see you
you're going to be...

05:01.470 --> 05:03.305
what, a tattooed alien hunter?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.475
Actually, a ninja bank robber.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.976
- Good.
- Yeah.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.067
For the record...

05:20.611 --> 05:22.446
I like you
no matter what you are.

05:24.614 --> 05:26.365
I like you too.

05:49.133 --> 05:50.468
Bing...

05:51.010 --> 05:52.595
Bing the dingaling.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.640
Instead of a helper,
Mr Manx got a thing.

06:01.769 --> 06:03.395
"Dear...

06:04.146 --> 06:07.190
Mr Manx..."

06:13.445 --> 06:15.696
"Please come back..."
No, no.

06:16.365 --> 06:17.615
No.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.493
"I'm sorry...

06:23.662 --> 06:25.996
...I let Vic McQueen..."

06:30.041 --> 06:32.585
No. Here, wait. "Vic..."

06:43.302 --> 06:45.845
Mr Manx. Where are you? I...

06:45.971 --> 06:49.849
Hi, this is Ashley-Sue
from Western Solar Panels calling.

06:49.975 --> 06:50.934
Can I speak with...

08:09.623 --> 08:12.041
- Hey.
- Mom...

08:12.166 --> 08:14.043
Vicky, are you OK?

08:15.586 --> 08:17.253
I got into RISD.

08:18.255 --> 08:21.174
The art school.
They gave me a full scholarship.

08:29.388 --> 08:30.890
Mom?

08:32.224 --> 08:34.768
Mrs McQueen,
my mom was wondering if...

08:35.477 --> 08:36.519
Oh my God, are you OK?

08:36.645 --> 08:39.022
Yeah. Vicky got into RISD.

08:40.063 --> 08:40.898
What?

08:42.316 --> 08:44.901
- That's amazing!
- It's really something.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.904
Vic, you're fricking amazing.
We have to celebrate.

08:49.447 --> 08:51.031
It's really something, Vicky.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.742
Congratulations.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.994
We can have a party!

09:07.336 --> 09:10.088
I... just don't know if it's right

09:10.213 --> 09:12.465
for the Brewsters
to put themselves out.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.425
Relax, Ma. They offered.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.679
Why?

09:18.178 --> 09:20.263
They want
to do something nice for me?

09:20.388 --> 09:21.972
These people are weird.

09:23.808 --> 09:25.267
They're my friends.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.817
RISD rock star in the house!

09:34.941 --> 09:36.776
You smart bitch!

09:38.486 --> 09:41.447
- Full ride? So dope.
- Thanks.

09:42.657 --> 09:44.616
I didn't think
it would actually happen.

09:45.701 --> 09:47.159
Is there anything in this?

09:47.284 --> 09:49.120
I got you. Here.

09:50.037 --> 09:51.539
Now...

09:51.664 --> 09:52.998
it's a party.

09:53.124 --> 09:56.459
McQueen, if anyone deserves this
it's you. I mean that.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.461
I deserve to go to prison with you.

09:58.586 --> 10:01.130
Didn't we commit,
like, five felonies?

10:01.255 --> 10:03.089
- Two at the most.
- OK. Right.

10:03.214 --> 10:04.549
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

10:28.110 --> 10:31.863
Ma, you're off the clock.
Can you just come back to the party?

10:31.988 --> 10:34.240
Mrs Brewster was looking for you.
Stop.

10:35.741 --> 10:37.826
The Brewsters aren't your family.

10:38.409 --> 10:39.411
I know.

10:40.035 --> 10:42.496
- They might be smarter than me...
- They're not.

10:42.621 --> 10:46.041
I guess you think you're smarter
too, but I'm still the mother.

10:47.959 --> 10:51.337
I just got into college. A full ride.
No one has to pay for anything.

10:53.547 --> 10:55.631
- I thought you'd be happy.
- I am.

10:56.132 --> 10:57.884
I am, honey. It's real impressive.

10:58.010 --> 11:01.679
But college or not,
this is not us.

11:01.804 --> 11:04.681
I just don't want you
finding that out the hard way.

11:35.623 --> 11:37.291
There's the college girl!

11:40.668 --> 11:42.378
Good work, Brat.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.714
Yeah, not much work,
but good work.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.217
I knew you could do it. Right?

11:48.841 --> 11:49.926
No thanks.

11:52.553 --> 11:54.806
You're never one
to turn down a free drink.

11:56.973 --> 11:58.266
I quit.

12:00.684 --> 12:01.769
When?

12:02.812 --> 12:04.146
After Bike Week.

12:05.231 --> 12:07.148
Dad, some of the things
I said were...

12:07.273 --> 12:09.983
No, no.
Everything you said was true.

12:11.485 --> 12:13.111
I give it a week.

12:16.948 --> 12:18.032
Vic, let her go.

12:19.909 --> 12:21.285
Vic...

12:22.244 --> 12:23.620
Enjoy your party.

12:25.538 --> 12:26.664
Just...

12:36.463 --> 12:37.381
Come here.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.927
Have you seen Linda?

12:42.511 --> 12:43.344
No.

12:43.469 --> 12:45.303
She's being so difficult.

12:47.682 --> 12:49.474
She's just sad that you're leaving.

12:49.599 --> 12:52.059
I'll be two hours away.
What's in this?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.689
It's not the same
as having you here.

12:59.148 --> 13:02.359
Art school's not forever.
I'll be home for breaks.

13:03.902 --> 13:06.320
- I know.
- Come here.

13:12.076 --> 13:14.911
Speaking of art,
what the hell is that?

13:16.413 --> 13:19.582
I mean, it looks like some fancy...

13:20.124 --> 13:21.500
- Cooch!
- Don't say...

13:25.169 --> 13:26.504
Go, go...

13:31.217 --> 13:32.509
Got another smoke?

13:37.930 --> 13:39.307
The kid did good.

13:51.357 --> 13:53.526
I want to be just like her
when I grow up.

13:55.277 --> 13:58.697
Providence is a big city.
They are not like us there.

14:00.324 --> 14:02.325
Maybe that's a good thing,
you know?

14:10.332 --> 14:12.791
Young girls, they get roophied,
they get attacked...

14:16.336 --> 14:18.797
She's got a good head
on her shoulders, Linda.

14:24.218 --> 14:26.219
You two got it all figured out,
don't you?

15:21.681 --> 15:22.974
Vicky?

15:34.399 --> 15:35.984
You beat me home?

15:41.864 --> 15:42.990
Vicky?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.456
Never seen you here before.

16:43.956 --> 16:45.041
Yeah.

16:45.583 --> 16:49.252
It's been a while since I needed
to party the demons away.

16:52.296 --> 16:54.590
You looking for someone to play with?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.967
Are you interested?

16:59.510 --> 17:00.802
Let's see.

17:04.556 --> 17:06.183
"Beware"?

17:07.683 --> 17:09.601
That's 11 points.

17:10.769 --> 17:12.604
How many for "stunner"?

17:13.104 --> 17:14.230
Seven.

17:15.647 --> 17:17.441
Do I make you nervous?

17:18.317 --> 17:20.569
Do you have something
that can calm me down?

17:21.194 --> 17:22.944
What do I get in return?

18:01.644 --> 18:03.062
Enjoy the party?

18:05.063 --> 18:06.314
You searched my room?

18:06.439 --> 18:08.274
It was out on the bed, Vicky.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.901
Where's my computer?
My art supplies?

18:11.026 --> 18:14.362
I'm keeping your personal items
locked up until you earn them back.

18:14.822 --> 18:16.030
I'm 18.

18:16.155 --> 18:18.198
You want to end up a junkie?
Like Craig?

18:18.323 --> 18:21.368
- Craig's not a junkie.
- 'Cause that is where this shit...

18:21.493 --> 18:23.829
- It's not like that.
- You're right. It won't be.

18:23.954 --> 18:25.079
Not on my watch.

18:25.204 --> 18:28.040
You live under my roof,
you follow my rules.

18:28.165 --> 18:31.293
School. Work. Home.

18:31.417 --> 18:34.254
- No parties. No boyfriends.
- Ma, you have no clue.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.548
No, Vicky.
This is for your own good.

18:41.844 --> 18:43.511
You think you're grown?

18:44.594 --> 18:46.513
Getting drunk and high,

18:46.639 --> 18:49.932
sashaying around the place
like you're a woman of the world...

18:51.017 --> 18:55.228
Because of what? Some college
gave you a ticket to rapetown?

18:58.690 --> 19:00.275
I'm glad you think that's funny.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.526
It's pretty good, Ma.

19:03.110 --> 19:05.736
Keep laughing.
Because you know what?

19:08.198 --> 19:09.365
What?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.994
Say goodbye to RISD.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.078
Because this right here,

19:15.203 --> 19:17.955
this proves that you are not ready

19:18.080 --> 19:19.748
to be on your own.

19:25.044 --> 19:26.713
How the hell would you know?

19:28.755 --> 19:30.717
How the hell would you know?

19:33.676 --> 19:37.263
You are an ignorant smalltown loser.

19:39.055 --> 19:40.932
No wonder Dad left you.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.190
Screw you.

19:52.901 --> 19:56.361
You leave this house,
you don't bother coming back.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.327
You live under my roof,
you follow my rules.

20:05.285 --> 20:07.788
This is for your own good.

20:08.747 --> 20:10.248
Say goodbye to RISD.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.751
Stop!

21:57.335 --> 22:00.462
I should have known
this holly-jolly bullshit was you.

22:03.006 --> 22:06.259
All your friends...
happy to see you as always!

22:06.384 --> 22:09.761
I'll never understand why you insist
on hanging with the riffraff.

22:09.886 --> 22:11.555
I'm sorry if my tastes don't live up

22:11.680 --> 22:14.640
to the bastard son
of a boom-town prostitute.

22:19.561 --> 22:22.439
Thick and sweet.
Just like I like it.

22:23.857 --> 22:27.151
To what do I owe the free drink?
Those kids starting to get to you?

22:27.276 --> 22:28.359
Never.

22:28.484 --> 22:30.279
There's a boy dreaming of gingerbread

22:30.404 --> 22:32.864
in the back seat of my Wraith
as we speak.

22:32.989 --> 22:36.074
Well, that explains
the bloom in your cheek.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.035
But not the drink.

22:42.204 --> 22:45.123
Jolene July has passed.

22:50.669 --> 22:52.379
I always liked her.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.049
Had a... nice ass.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.800
Like she was smuggling
a pair of French hens

22:57.925 --> 23:00.261
in that car hop uniform.

23:00.803 --> 23:01.678
Who told you?

23:02.804 --> 23:04.139
I sensed it.

23:05.222 --> 23:06.515
How did she go?

23:07.641 --> 23:09.435
Trying to kill me.

23:10.435 --> 23:13.063
And if I'm honest
she got closer than I'd prefer.

23:13.188 --> 23:18.150
The Dark Tunnels cripple
put a scare into old Charlie Manx.

23:19.525 --> 23:21.110
With help.

23:23.446 --> 23:25.490
I knew it the moment I saw you.

23:26.783 --> 23:28.451
There's a new girl.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.827
This one's special.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.121
I can feel it.

24:27.289 --> 24:32.127
Only girls who are nice and sweet
get to have a tasty treat.

24:46.305 --> 24:47.849
What do you want?

24:51.183 --> 24:53.061
You've been a naughty girl.

24:56.605 --> 24:59.065
People are going to notice
that I'm missing, Bing.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.067
They'll call the cops.
You'll go to jail.

25:01.191 --> 25:02.901
No I won't.

25:03.444 --> 25:05.236
I heard your mom yelling.

25:06.654 --> 25:08.364
She thinks you ran away.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.576
Everyone knows your dad left you.

25:14.703 --> 25:16.496
You're all alone.

25:23.502 --> 25:25.211
I was your friend.

25:25.837 --> 25:27.422
Friends to the end.

25:27.546 --> 25:28.840
Yeah.

25:32.009 --> 25:34.094
But you wrecked that.

25:40.015 --> 25:41.725
We can be, again.

25:45.769 --> 25:47.520
You just have to be nice.

25:48.730 --> 25:50.732
Bing... Please don't.

25:50.857 --> 25:53.109
Let's just talk about this
for a second, please.

25:53.234 --> 25:55.527
You do not have to...
No, no...

26:08.788 --> 26:10.039
OK.

26:10.164 --> 26:11.957
Say...

26:12.082 --> 26:16.920
"I love you, Bing Partridge."

26:20.298 --> 26:22.007
I...

26:23.926 --> 26:25.927
"...love...

26:27.678 --> 26:28.930
you...

26:29.055 --> 26:32.058
more than anything...

26:32.183 --> 26:34.267
Bing Partridge."

28:44.914 --> 28:47.334
Do you know
why tonight's the best night?

28:50.294 --> 28:52.254
Because you're my second chance.

28:53.255 --> 28:54.840
You got me onto the naughty list.

28:56.633 --> 28:58.885
But I figured out what to do
all by myself.

29:00.344 --> 29:03.221
Mr Manx will be so happy
I got rid of you,

29:03.347 --> 29:05.723
he'll put me
on the nice list forever.

29:22.236 --> 29:24.822
What makes you think
Mr Manx wants to get rid of me?

29:26.366 --> 29:29.117
You caused all kinds of problems.

29:29.910 --> 29:32.411
He told me I'd be welcome
in Christmasland.

29:34.997 --> 29:36.707
Liar! Pants on fire.

29:36.832 --> 29:40.293
No, when we met at the bus station
he said I belonged there with him.

29:41.418 --> 29:45.047
But you're naughty.
I saw it for myself.

29:47.549 --> 29:49.509
Well, I'm just...

29:49.634 --> 29:52.637
I'm just telling you
what Manx told me.

29:53.387 --> 29:55.263
You don't have to believe me,
but if...

29:56.348 --> 29:57.808
if I'm right...

30:01.644 --> 30:03.937
He really said that stuff?

30:05.522 --> 30:07.981
Bing, I think
you really screwed up.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.193
- You do?
- Yeah.

30:11.318 --> 30:14.196
If Charlie Manx finds out
you kidnapped me...

30:15.238 --> 30:17.907
sounds like you'll be
on the naughty list forever.

30:18.032 --> 30:20.867
But then I won't be able
to get into Christmasland.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.120
Just let me go.
It will be our secret.

30:27.915 --> 30:29.124
Yeah...

30:35.963 --> 30:37.297
No, Bing, wait...

32:07.788 --> 32:09.622
I can't let you go, Vic.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.376
You'll tell Mr Manx what I did,

32:14.501 --> 32:17.129
and I won't be able
to get into Christmasland.

32:27.929 --> 32:30.388
Christmasland sounds boring.

32:31.641 --> 32:34.391
I don't understand
why you want to go there so bad.

32:35.393 --> 32:36.520
Man...

32:37.311 --> 32:40.022
I'd give everything
for Christmas any day.

32:44.692 --> 32:47.445
Some of my best feelings
came at Christmas.

32:51.198 --> 32:54.367
I used to think
my best feelings happened

32:54.492 --> 32:56.702
with my family at Lake Winnipesaukee.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.289
One Christmas,
my dad gave me his gas mask.

33:03.958 --> 33:06.209
And my mom made sugar cookies.

33:08.962 --> 33:10.588
She said...

33:12.756 --> 33:15.342
"I love you more than anything...

33:16.218 --> 33:17.678
Bing Partridge."

33:27.268 --> 33:29.144
That was the best feeling.

33:33.357 --> 33:36.235
My very best feeling was
when I got into art school.

33:40.779 --> 33:42.072
You got in?

33:43.030 --> 33:44.283
Yeah.

33:45.617 --> 33:47.243
That's good, Vic.

33:48.451 --> 33:49.911
That's real good.

33:51.288 --> 33:53.622
I'm real glad you had that feeling.

33:56.250 --> 34:00.253
My very best feeling came
when I killed my parents.

34:02.839 --> 34:05.216
Put a nail in both their heads.

34:06.008 --> 34:07.426
Pop...

34:08.260 --> 34:09.428
Pop...

34:10.344 --> 34:11.679
"Bing...

34:12.847 --> 34:15.016
Bing the dingaling!

34:15.975 --> 34:19.018
Instead of a son,
I got a thing."

34:28.735 --> 34:30.820
He can't say that any more.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.907
I'm sorry that happened, Bing.
I'm sorry he said those things.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.327
Every time he did,

34:39.327 --> 34:42.204
my mom went into the kitchen
to make cookies.

34:44.414 --> 34:46.206
She didn't protect you.

34:58.176 --> 34:59.927
My mom...

35:06.682 --> 35:08.559
She was a scaredy-cat.

35:14.022 --> 35:15.773
Charlie Manx...

35:16.899 --> 35:19.567
he knows about your mom and dad,
doesn't he?

35:19.692 --> 35:20.944
Yeah.

35:21.527 --> 35:24.405
Yeah, he told you to hurt Sharon
like you hurt them,

35:24.530 --> 35:26.490
or you wouldn't get
into Christmasland?

35:26.615 --> 35:27.616
No.

35:31.827 --> 35:34.079
I did Sharon all by myself.

35:41.461 --> 35:43.671
Her skin was soft,

35:44.254 --> 35:46.005
like my mom's.

35:49.050 --> 35:52.178
But she smelled different, like...

35:54.179 --> 35:56.722
Like coconut shampoo and...

35:59.392 --> 36:01.352
menthol cigarettes.

36:04.813 --> 36:06.982
But she tasted just as sweet.

36:25.246 --> 36:29.166
You smell like the grass
after the rain.

36:31.376 --> 36:34.086
I'll bet you taste just as sweet.

36:46.388 --> 36:47.556
No!

37:09.657 --> 37:12.159
Her name is Vic McQueen.

37:12.743 --> 37:14.953
She travels
along the Shorter Way Bridge.

37:15.078 --> 37:16.788
I saw it open up on the map,

37:16.913 --> 37:18.748
not too far
from my neck of the woods.

37:18.873 --> 37:20.416
She's strong, Abe.

37:20.541 --> 37:22.584
Almost all the troubles
I've ever known

37:22.709 --> 37:24.878
started with one woman or another.

37:25.545 --> 37:27.713
And the happiest times of my life

37:27.838 --> 37:30.549
have been free
of the feminine influence.

37:31.508 --> 37:36.095
Most men spend their lives being
passed from one woman to another,

37:36.220 --> 37:39.515
as I was from my whore mother
to my nag wife.

37:39.639 --> 37:42.893
Your problem is that you can't
stop thinking about them.

37:43.018 --> 37:45.269
My children need a mother.

37:46.604 --> 37:48.397
And I'll admit Vic McQueen has stoked

37:48.481 --> 37:50.607
a fire I've long struggled
to keep dormant.

37:50.732 --> 37:52.025
Exactly.

37:53.025 --> 37:56.320
I don't care how special she is.
You need to kill her.

37:59.073 --> 38:00.990
She's not like the others.

38:02.199 --> 38:03.617
She's pure.

38:06.578 --> 38:07.829
Jesus...

38:08.288 --> 38:10.372
Last time you gave
the Virgin Mary spiel,

38:10.498 --> 38:12.500
you proposed to Jolene.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.292
When this one rejects you,

38:14.417 --> 38:16.878
are you going to leave her to rot
in a mental ward?

38:17.003 --> 38:19.296
I never showed Jolene my Inscape.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.800
If she had beheld
the glory of Christmasland,

38:22.925 --> 38:24.634
things could have been different.

38:25.385 --> 38:27.178
You kill this woman,

38:27.804 --> 38:29.930
or drive her mad like the last one.

38:30.890 --> 38:34.851
No piece of ass
is worth risking your Inscape for.

38:36.519 --> 38:38.270
Vic McQueen...

38:39.020 --> 38:41.148
is worth the risk.

38:44.358 --> 38:47.361
And if your glorious jingle bells
don't convince her?

38:51.155 --> 38:53.783
Then the dinner bell will ring
instead.

39:06.793 --> 39:08.336
Where...

39:10.922 --> 39:12.966
Where is the Brat's bike?

39:58.586 --> 40:00.044
The lunatic belongs in jail.

40:00.170 --> 40:03.381
But we can't go to the cops or
I'll end up in the psych ward again.

40:05.967 --> 40:07.718
Then I take care of him myself.

40:08.302 --> 40:11.054
- He'll kill you.
- Then I go down swinging.

40:11.180 --> 40:14.640
Craig, I do not need to be worrying
about you on top of everything else.

40:14.765 --> 40:17.559
Can you promise me
that you will not go after him?

40:22.104 --> 40:23.480
Fine.

40:32.654 --> 40:33.907
I've got to take this.

40:34.865 --> 40:35.908
Hey.

40:36.991 --> 40:40.203
Brat. Super great news.

40:40.870 --> 40:43.455
The bag came back, on its own.

40:43.580 --> 40:44.956
I don't understand.

40:46.124 --> 40:49.168
Me neither really,
but it found me.

40:49.877 --> 40:51.462
Told me you have your bike.

40:52.837 --> 40:54.714
No, my mother sold it.

40:56.799 --> 40:58.468
Here's a true story.

40:58.593 --> 41:02.471
The bag can be cryptic
but it never lies.

41:04.056 --> 41:06.599
Mothers, on the other hand...

41:07.850 --> 41:10.977
Yeah, they say
they're trying to help, but...

41:11.811 --> 41:13.896
Maggie, are you OK?
You sound weird.

41:14.481 --> 41:17.399
Never been better.

41:17.524 --> 41:20.610
Do me a favor, OK?
Keep hunting Charlie Manx.

41:21.611 --> 41:23.321
You're the only one
that can stop him.

41:23.947 --> 41:25.948
No, I'm not. We're a team.

41:26.531 --> 41:30.034
You and Joe were the only ones
who ever really got me, anyway.

41:31.661 --> 41:33.955
Stay gold, ponyboy.

41:35.121 --> 41:36.581
Bye, Brat.

41:36.706 --> 41:38.041
Maggie?

41:42.878 --> 41:45.005
Hey, it's Maggie.
Leave a message.

41:45.630 --> 41:48.049
- Are you OK?
- I need you to take me home. Now.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.142
- Where's my bike?
- Where the hell have you been?

42:00.268 --> 42:01.559
I need my bike. Where is it?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.980
- I told you, I sold it.
- You're lying.

42:05.605 --> 42:09.358
Vicky, I don't want to fight. OK?
But the drinking, the drugs...

42:09.483 --> 42:11.068
Ma, I don't have time for this.

42:11.193 --> 42:14.445
I may be stupid
but I have common sense.

42:15.530 --> 42:17.740
Common sense isn't
why you stayed with Dad.

42:19.658 --> 42:21.910
You're right.
I had you to think about.

42:22.910 --> 42:23.995
No.

42:24.913 --> 42:27.831
No, you were afraid of being alone.

42:28.624 --> 42:32.627
That is what all of this was.
The party, college, all of it.

42:34.129 --> 42:35.338
With me and Dad both gone,

42:35.463 --> 42:39.300
the only person you will have
to blame for your life is you.

42:41.509 --> 42:44.178
You're not stupid, Ma.
You're a coward.

42:53.019 --> 42:54.937
It's not fair.

42:56.271 --> 42:59.481
It's not fair.
What do I do when you leave?

43:00.150 --> 43:02.359
What do I do when you leave?

43:06.154 --> 43:08.572
Tell me what you've done
with my bike, Mom.

43:36.220 --> 43:39.181
You and Joe were the only ones
who ever really got me, anyway.

43:42.225 --> 43:43.893
Vic, I'm done.

43:44.019 --> 43:46.228
That feeling is gone.

43:47.688 --> 43:49.105
Bye, Brat.

44:24.050 --> 44:25.676
Maggie!

44:45.652 --> 44:47.319
Maggie, come on.

44:47.445 --> 44:50.030
Wake up.
You have to wake up. Come on.

45:01.205 --> 45:02.832
That's it.

45:08.795 --> 45:11.005
That's it. There we go.

45:11.713 --> 45:13.883
OK. Come on. Here you are.

45:17.511 --> 45:18.886
There you go.

45:19.804 --> 45:22.222
That's it. You're OK.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.765
You're OK. Come on.

45:26.518 --> 45:27.768
I got you.

45:30.563 --> 45:32.689
I guess you found your bike.
