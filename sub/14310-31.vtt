[instrumental music]

00:07.080 --> 00:10.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in a forest

00:10.140 --> 00:14.099
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.119 --> 00:17.010
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:17.030 --> 00:18.230
They were good.

00:19.010 --> 00:22.019
[theme music]

00:24.079 --> 00:28.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:28.149 --> 00:29.219
He was bad.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.119
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:33.140 --> 00:36.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:36.039 --> 00:38.109
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:38.130 --> 00:40.119
[laughing]

00:40.140 --> 00:43.109
Ooh! Oh, I'll get you!

00:43.130 --> 00:46.140
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

00:46.159 --> 00:49.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.070
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:53.090 --> 00:57.140
And if you are good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:57.159 --> 00:59.079
of the Smurfs.

01:01.079 --> 01:03.170
[instrumental music]

01:05.090 --> 01:08.039
[intense music]

01:08.219 --> 01:10.109
[laughter]

01:10.129 --> 01:12.189
Happiness. I can feel it.

01:12.210 --> 01:16.079
There's happiness in my forest,
and I hate it!

01:16.099 --> 01:17.200
Cut out that happiness!

01:17.219 --> 01:21.049
That's an order from me,
Gargamel!

01:22.039 --> 01:23.099
[screaming]

01:23.120 --> 01:26.079
You can feel it, too,
can't you, Azrael?

01:26.099 --> 01:29.099
All that dreadful cheer.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.140
Azrael?

01:30.159 --> 01:32.150
[groaning]

01:34.039 --> 01:35.210
(Gargamel)
'I must capture those Smurfs'

01:35.229 --> 01:38.069
and put an end
to all that happiness.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.159
Don't just sit there.
Think of a plan! Think!

01:40.180 --> 01:44.159
- Ah.. Ah! Ah!
- 'Think! Think!'

01:44.180 --> 01:45.150
thud

01:45.170 --> 01:48.039
I must find their weakness.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.099
Let's see.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.200
(Gargamel)
'Color, blue.'

01:51.219 --> 01:54.150
- 'Three apples high.'
- 'Ah.'

01:54.170 --> 01:56.159
- 'Big hearts.'
- 'Yeah.'

01:56.180 --> 01:58.159
Big hearts! That's it!

01:58.180 --> 02:01.219
I'll get them
through their hearts.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.060
I will send them a Smurfette!

02:05.079 --> 02:06.079
[gibberish]

02:06.099 --> 02:07.209
[smoke hissing]

02:07.230 --> 02:09.020
Ah!

02:11.000 --> 02:14.009
The Smurfette
will be their downfall!

02:14.030 --> 02:16.090
[laughing]

02:16.110 --> 02:18.199
This magical lump of blue clay

02:18.219 --> 02:21.159
will become
the first female Smurf.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.229
'A beautiful, but evil Smurf'

02:24.009 --> 02:26.210
to lead all the others
straight to me!

02:26.229 --> 02:28.159
[bubbling]

02:31.030 --> 02:32.009
Let's see..

02:32.030 --> 02:34.129
A dash of sugar and spice

02:34.150 --> 02:36.120
'but nothing nice.'

02:36.139 --> 02:39.180
A dram of crocodile tears.

02:39.199 --> 02:42.009
(Azrael)
'Oh..'

02:42.030 --> 02:43.219
[bubbling]

02:44.000 --> 02:46.219
(Gargamel)
'Half a pack of lies.'

02:47.009 --> 02:48.129
(Azrael)
'Ah..'

02:49.199 --> 02:52.219
- 'The chatter of a Magpie.'
- Ah..

02:55.120 --> 02:58.039
And the hardest stone
for her heart!

02:58.060 --> 02:59.170
'Yeah.'

02:59.189 --> 03:01.000
plop

03:01.020 --> 03:04.030
[dramatic music]

03:07.009 --> 03:08.009
zap zap zap

03:08.030 --> 03:09.180
[Azrael squealing]

03:09.199 --> 03:12.020
- It worked! It worked!
- Ah!

03:12.039 --> 03:15.099
I have created a Smurfette!

03:15.120 --> 03:18.139
[instrumental music]

03:31.159 --> 03:32.139
Halt!

03:32.159 --> 03:34.120
- Ooh!
- Ow!

03:34.139 --> 03:37.110
Okay, Smurfs,
we need plenty of smurf-berries.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.120
So everybody pick a direction
and go smurf them.

03:40.139 --> 03:42.199
[clamoring]

03:42.219 --> 03:44.020
Wait a minute!

03:44.039 --> 03:45.099
[screeching]

03:45.120 --> 03:47.000
- Yeah?
- I meant..

03:47.020 --> 03:49.110
Everybody pick
a different direction.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.229
- 'Oh!'
- 'Ah!'

03:51.009 --> 03:54.180
Okay, I'll just follow
my mirror.

03:54.199 --> 03:58.069
- I'll smurf this way.
- I hate picking directions.

03:58.090 --> 04:00.069
Why don't you go that way,
Grouchy?

04:00.090 --> 04:03.069
Uh, okay. But I hate that way.

04:03.090 --> 04:04.199
Boy, oh, boy!

04:04.219 --> 04:07.199
I-I'll just sneak up
on those old smurf-berries

04:07.219 --> 04:10.090
when they're not looking
and lasso them!

04:10.110 --> 04:12.030
whirr whirr

04:12.050 --> 04:13.120
Clumsy!

04:13.139 --> 04:16.029
Oops. Oh, sorry, Brainy.

04:18.060 --> 04:21.069
[Smurfette sobbing]

04:24.100 --> 04:27.079
Oh, boo-hoo.
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.220
It's awful! I've never been
so miserable in my whole life.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.149
I'm all alone. Ooh.

04:32.170 --> 04:35.199
Lost in this scary forest
full of frightening noises.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.199
- Ooh..
- Hey!

04:37.220 --> 04:41.220
[gasps]
Oh, you startled me.
Who are you?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.230
I'm a Smurf! Who are you?

04:44.009 --> 04:45.149
I'm a Smurfette.

04:45.170 --> 04:48.040
- A Smurfette?
- You know what that is?

04:48.060 --> 04:50.110
- No.
- Do you like what you see?

04:50.129 --> 04:52.230
- I don't know.
- You will.

04:53.009 --> 04:56.180
- Where's your village?
- This way.

04:56.199 --> 05:00.079
Wait!
Aren't you going to carry me?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.129
I'm weak and helpless.

05:02.149 --> 05:04.199
Oh, okay!

05:06.110 --> 05:10.230
Boy! You really know how
to sweep a girl off her feet!

05:12.050 --> 05:14.129
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

05:14.149 --> 05:18.029
Look what Hefty found
in the woods, Papa Smurf!

05:18.050 --> 05:20.139
(Brainy)
'A-a Smurfette!'

05:20.160 --> 05:22.100
Oh, Papa Smurf

05:22.120 --> 05:25.129
I suffered all night
in the hideous forest.

05:25.149 --> 05:30.029
Lost and alone.
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo! Boo-hoo!

05:30.050 --> 05:33.079
There, there, my dear.
You're among friends now.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.220
You can stay right here in our
village for as long as you like.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.029
Oh, boy!
Smurfette's going to stay!

05:40.050 --> 05:42.129
[cheering]

05:42.149 --> 05:44.060
We're in for a treat!

05:44.079 --> 05:46.170
[cheering]

05:46.189 --> 05:49.209
You're in for a surprise.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.129
[instrumental music]

05:55.199 --> 05:58.209
[humming]

06:01.110 --> 06:05.189
Calling old wizard.
Gargamel, can you hear me?

06:05.209 --> 06:07.139
beep beep

06:09.000 --> 06:11.050
It's about time. Where are you?

06:11.069 --> 06:14.160
- I'm in the smurf village and--
- 'Excellent!'

06:14.180 --> 06:18.050
(Gargamel)
Now get out there and capture
their little blue hearts.

06:18.069 --> 06:19.160
And don't fail.

06:19.180 --> 06:23.230
Remember,
I made you and I can break you.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.050
[Gargamel laughing]

06:26.069 --> 06:30.009
Uh, I, I-I guess
I'd better get started.

06:30.029 --> 06:33.040
[humming]

06:38.009 --> 06:38.230
crash

06:39.009 --> 06:42.189
Yoo-hoo! Here I am!

06:42.209 --> 06:45.110
Hi there, Smurf. New in town?

06:45.129 --> 06:46.230
[groans]

06:47.009 --> 06:50.110
This is gonna be even easier
than I thought.

06:50.129 --> 06:53.139
[hammering]

06:54.189 --> 06:56.129
Yoo-hoo!

06:56.149 --> 06:58.199
Ouch! Ouch! Ooh!

06:58.220 --> 07:01.199
Oops. Oh, sorry, Brainy.
I-I'm sorry.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.110
Not half as sorry
as you're going to be.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.120
And you can blame it on her.

07:06.139 --> 07:09.180
Oh, now look what you've done!

07:11.160 --> 07:14.129
Maybe I better try
a more subtle approach.

07:14.149 --> 07:18.149
Perhaps, a picnic!

07:18.170 --> 07:23.050
Like, uh, thanks for helping me
with this firewood, Hefty.

07:23.069 --> 07:25.050
Oh, no problem, Harmony.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.180
After all, what are Smurfs for?

07:27.199 --> 07:31.050
[laughing]
How wonderful
that my little Smurfs

07:31.069 --> 07:32.209
get on so well together.

07:32.230 --> 07:35.189
Here, Harmony. Smurfette
invited me to a picnic.

07:35.209 --> 07:38.100
- But I can't go.
- But she already invited me.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.230
And I'm busy, too.
Here, Vanity, you go.

07:41.009 --> 07:42.090
No, no, uh, I'm busy, too.

07:42.110 --> 07:45.009
- You take it, Grouchy.
- I hate picnics.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.170
I can't go either.

07:46.189 --> 07:48.220
Not me.
I've got something cooking.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.199
- Well, I certainly can't go.
- Well, don't look at me.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.170
- 'Or me.'
- Me neither.

07:53.189 --> 07:56.079
[indistinct chatter]

07:58.110 --> 08:01.029
And I have important work
in my lab.

08:03.189 --> 08:07.019
Gee, I wonder
why they aren't coming.

08:08.230 --> 08:11.139
[Jokey laughing]

08:12.040 --> 08:13.139
Hi.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.050
Hi, Smurfette.
I brought you a present.

08:16.069 --> 08:20.019
A present? For me?
Oh, how sweet.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.189
I knew
they all couldn't resist me.

08:23.209 --> 08:24.180
boom

08:24.199 --> 08:26.100
Surprise, surprise!

08:26.120 --> 08:28.110
[laughing]

08:29.230 --> 08:32.220
This isn't working out
quite like I planned.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.169
Hm, but if I can't
lure them out

08:36.190 --> 08:39.110
maybe I can flap them out.

08:41.029 --> 08:43.058
Yoo-hoo, Greedy Smurf.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.169
Oh, hi, Smurfette.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.190
I, I baked you a cake.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.059
[slurps]
Well, that's different.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.100
But first
show me how that works.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.019
Hey, no!
You could flood everything!

08:56.039 --> 08:58.220
Oh, just one
little teeny-weeny pull.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.059
What could happen?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.190
We'd, we'd have a creek
without a village.

09:02.210 --> 09:05.169
Hm, guess I'll just
have to ask a Smurf

09:05.190 --> 09:07.190
who appreciates a good cake.

09:07.210 --> 09:12.129
No. Don't go!
I'll-I'll show you how it works.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.000
[creaking]

09:15.019 --> 09:16.200
[water gushing]

09:16.220 --> 09:19.100
[dramatic music]

09:19.120 --> 09:21.230
Oh! How pretty!

09:22.009 --> 09:24.230
Yeah. Well, I better
close the valves now.

09:25.009 --> 09:26.220
No, wait. Not yet.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.210
Ah! Smurfette, let go!

09:29.230 --> 09:31.210
[intense music]

09:31.230 --> 09:34.159
[water gushing]

09:37.139 --> 09:39.220
Where's all this water from?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.039
The dam must have broken!

09:42.059 --> 09:44.000
Let's get out of here!

09:44.019 --> 09:45.159
[grunting]

09:45.179 --> 09:48.129
Hey, you!
You're doing this on purpose!

09:48.149 --> 09:51.149
Yes, and you sure
aren't helping any!

09:51.169 --> 09:52.159
[valve creaking]

09:52.179 --> 09:54.200
[Smurfette screaming]

09:54.220 --> 09:56.059
Smurfette!

09:56.080 --> 09:57.100
[water gushing]

09:57.120 --> 09:59.159
(Smurfette)
Help! Help!

09:59.179 --> 10:00.220
Well, watch you step.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.139
We must reach the dam
before it's too late.

10:03.159 --> 10:05.070
Papa, look!

10:05.090 --> 10:07.139
Help! Help!

10:07.159 --> 10:10.049
- Smurfette!
- 'Help! Help!'

10:10.070 --> 10:12.120
- Grab my hand!
- Help!

10:12.139 --> 10:15.159
Okay, Hefty. Pull us out.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.100
- Argh!
- 'Help!'

10:17.120 --> 10:20.129
[hammering]

10:25.070 --> 10:27.210
[coughing]

10:28.200 --> 10:31.110
You, you all saved my life.

10:31.129 --> 10:34.080
[coughing]

10:34.100 --> 10:37.139
Yes. But why did you open
the dam?

10:37.159 --> 10:40.210
Open the dam? Who? Me?

10:40.230 --> 10:43.090
B-but I'd never.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.220
[clamoring]

10:47.179 --> 10:51.029
Order! Order!
Quiet in the court!

10:51.049 --> 10:54.049
And so, Smurfette,
in view of the evidence

10:54.070 --> 10:57.110
and what Greedy has told us,
do you have any defense

10:57.129 --> 10:59.149
'for trying
to flood the village?'

10:59.169 --> 11:02.169
Well, uh, um, uh

11:02.190 --> 11:04.139
I-I just wanna say that..

11:04.159 --> 11:07.149
(Smurfette)
'W-w-what I mean is that, uh..'

11:07.169 --> 11:09.230
Oh, boo..

11:10.009 --> 11:13.080
I'm taking orders from Gargamel!

11:13.100 --> 11:14.159
(all)
Gargamel?

11:14.179 --> 11:16.059
Let me at her! Let me at her!

11:16.080 --> 11:18.129
She can't smurf us
and get away with it.

11:18.149 --> 11:22.100
[sobbing]
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.200
I almost led you all
into Gargamel's clutches.

And you've been so nice to me.

11:31.070 --> 11:34.059
Oh, well, don't cry, Smurfette.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.220
I mean, my, my smurf
is worse than my bite.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.019
I mean, I..

11:38.039 --> 11:40.129
Whatever you do to me,
I deserve.

Throw me out of the village,
abandon me in the forest or..

11:44.049 --> 11:47.139

...send me back to Gargamel.

There, there, Smurfette.

12:05.039 --> 12:07.029
Gargamel created you
to smurf us.

12:07.049 --> 12:08.149
It's not your fault.

12:08.169 --> 12:11.190

Papa Smurf.'

A real Smurf?

12:23.049 --> 12:25.230
- Impossible!
- Not in a million smurfs.

12:26.009 --> 12:26.230
Unthinkable.

12:27.009 --> 12:28.070
No one's ever become

12:28.090 --> 12:29.129
a Smurf before.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.039
You really want to be a Smurf?

12:32.059 --> 12:34.009
Oh, more than anything.

12:34.029 --> 12:37.129
It can't be done.
Smurfs are Smurfs, not made.

12:37.149 --> 12:39.149
Can you really make me a Smurf?

12:39.169 --> 12:44.000
Well, I may not be able to undo
all of Gargamel's spell

12:44.019 --> 12:45.090

12:50.070 --> 12:51.169
Uh, th-that's right.

12:51.190 --> 12:54.100
Papa Smurf can smurf anything
he smurfs his mind to.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.029
You just watch.
You take my word for it.

12:57.049 --> 13:00.230
You listen to me, you know
I know what I'm talking about.

Hello, Smurfs. Heh-heh.

13:46.039 --> 13:47.139

Now, that's more like it!

14:07.039 --> 14:08.179
Smurfs for the Smurfette.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.019
- Hey, I smurfed her first.
- No, I did.

14:11.039 --> 14:14.070
Smurfette, here's a surprise!

14:14.090 --> 14:17.159
No, don't! It'll kablooey
right in your face.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.120
Did you ever see
a cream-layered cake

14:22.139 --> 14:25.029

kablooey in your face?

anybody can make a mistake.

14:51.210 --> 14:54.070
Well, what do you suppose
got into them?

14:54.090 --> 14:57.200
Um, uh, maybe you'd better smurf
back to your house, my dear

14:57.220 --> 15:00.009
and, uh, freshen up.

15:00.029 --> 15:03.039

Oh, dear!

I know I finally look like
a Smurfette, Papa Smurf

15:09.000 --> 15:10.149
but I sure don't feel like one.

15:10.169 --> 15:14.190

I'm afraid you'll have to manage
that part on your own.

15:14.210 --> 15:17.169
I will? But how?

15:17.190 --> 15:21.110
You'll smurf what to do
when the time comes, Smurfette.

You've changed.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.179
I sense
Papa Smurf's hand in this.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.080
Meow.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.000
Gargamel, you nasty old wizard.

15:44.019 --> 15:45.149
I don't know
what you want now, but--

15:45.169 --> 15:47.120
My dear, my dear.

15:47.139 --> 15:51.210
I want only
to grant your fondest wish.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.090
You mean, to be a real Smurf?

15:53.110 --> 15:55.059
No, I mean your wish to pay back

15:55.080 --> 15:58.110
those miserable little creatures
for their bothersome meddling.

- 'I-I mean..'

16:02.029 --> 16:05.049
Uh, uh, don't you want
to pay the Smurfs back

16:05.070 --> 16:07.070
for their, uh, kindness?

16:07.090 --> 16:09.169
Oh, yes.
They've been so nice to me.

16:09.190 --> 16:11.139
I should do something nice
for them.

16:11.159 --> 16:13.169
Exactly, my child.

16:13.190 --> 16:16.149
And I suggest a-a party.

16:16.169 --> 16:18.190
A-a surprise party.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.149
[chuckling]

16:21.169 --> 16:24.070
And you can fix that for me,
Gargamel?

16:24.090 --> 16:26.129
(Gargamel)
'It would be my pleasure.'

16:26.149 --> 16:28.190
Just get all the Smurfs
to the big oak tree

16:28.210 --> 16:33.059
by this afternoon,
I'll take care of the rest.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.009
Ahem, I want you all to know

16:48.029 --> 16:51.009
that I planned
a nice surprise for you.

16:51.029 --> 16:54.149
- 'Yay!
- 'Oh, boy! Oh, boy!'

16:54.169 --> 16:57.159

at the big oak in the forest.

As soon as I pick out
just the right dress

17:14.220 --> 17:18.079

17:18.098 --> 17:22.140
This way, Smurfs. The big oak
is just over the hill.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.039
No, this one's too long.
I wore that this morning.

17:26.059 --> 17:30.000
Oh, this one's too plain.
I'll save that for the night.

That one? Nah!

to be happy in my forest.

will be their last.
