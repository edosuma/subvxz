00:39.360 --> 00:41.000
- (Waves splashing)
- (Sails flapping)

00:41.001 --> 00:43.665
- (Wood creaking)
- (Men whispering)

01:17.117 --> 01:19.651
(Men shouting)

01:22.072 --> 01:24.656
Are you certain this is wise, sir?

01:26.660 --> 01:30.545
Stories I hear about the
raiders in these waters,

01:30.547 --> 01:32.213
their brutality...

01:32.215 --> 01:34.999
Cui bono, Mr. Fogg.

01:35.001 --> 01:37.001
These men profit nothing from blood.

01:37.003 --> 01:39.504
They profit from cargo.
And they profit most

01:39.506 --> 01:42.223
when that cargo is
least costly to win.

01:42.225 --> 01:45.009
Those stories you've heard...

01:45.011 --> 01:46.728
tools of the trade,

01:46.730 --> 01:49.230
self-applied
by the pirates themselves,

01:49.232 --> 01:51.900
intended to separate us
from our cargo

01:51.902 --> 01:54.068
by surrender rather than sword.

01:54.070 --> 01:57.572
These are men, Mr. Fogg,
not monsters.

01:59.609 --> 02:03.278
If we behave rationally and civilly,

02:03.280 --> 02:05.029
so will they.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.016
(Men yelling)

02:25.018 --> 02:27.218
MAN:
Down to the well, move!

02:27.220 --> 02:28.636
The ship is yours, sir.

02:28.638 --> 02:30.888
Our manifest.

02:30.890 --> 02:32.724
Everything that would be
of value to you

02:32.726 --> 02:35.026
is accounted for, and its
location in the hold.

02:36.613 --> 02:39.113
Eight barrels, marked "JP,"

02:39.115 --> 02:42.033
forward hold, port side.
Mr. Neustadt, step to it.

02:42.035 --> 02:44.068
Pardon me, Captain.
May I ask,

02:44.070 --> 02:46.955
are you one of the pirates that
calls the port of Nassau home?

02:46.957 --> 02:48.656
MEEKS:
Three barrels, tea...

02:48.658 --> 02:50.825
I'm a recent arrival to Nassau.

02:50.827 --> 02:55.079
I only ask inasmuch as it's become
something of a fascination of mine.

02:55.081 --> 02:57.131
They say the reality of the place

02:57.133 --> 02:59.083
is far more interesting
than the myth.

02:59.085 --> 03:02.253
The business there is so
efficient, so enlightened,

03:02.255 --> 03:06.007
that all trade is managed
by a teenaged girl.

03:06.009 --> 03:07.892
Tell me, is that true?

03:13.016 --> 03:14.565
What is it?

03:17.737 --> 03:19.771
Ashe.

03:19.773 --> 03:22.073
As in Lord Ashe.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.113
Then let's get on with it.

03:37.123 --> 03:40.041
(Whistles)
Everyone up!

03:54.224 --> 03:56.641
Oh, no, please.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.149
Go ahead!

04:12.542 --> 04:14.992
- MAN: Mercy! Merc...
- (Gunshots)

04:20.466 --> 04:23.584
I'd like to thank you for the
orderly surrender of your ship.

04:23.586 --> 04:26.554
It's truly amazing to me how
many men in your position

04:26.556 --> 04:28.056
lack the sense to do the same.

04:28.058 --> 04:32.143
Ordinarily I would
return the courtesy,

04:32.145 --> 04:35.730
relieve you of your cargo
and be on my way.

04:35.732 --> 04:37.565
But your ship is about
to yield a prize

04:37.567 --> 04:41.152
of far, far greater value
than our wildest expectation,

04:41.154 --> 04:44.105
a far greater prize

04:44.107 --> 04:47.825
for which I'd rather not
leave witnesses to the taking.

04:47.827 --> 04:50.495
Please, please, sir.
I have a wife and a son.

04:50.497 --> 04:52.580
- (Gunshot)
- (Body thuds)

04:58.838 --> 05:01.089
(Men barking orders)

05:10.850 --> 05:12.800
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.

05:14.053 --> 05:15.720
Hell of a prize.

05:55.195 --> 05:57.829
(Theme music playing)

07:31.107 --> 07:32.773
SILVER:
Captain.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.583
Captain.

07:49.092 --> 07:51.876
Captain, before we're seen...

07:53.596 --> 07:55.680
Don't call him that.

07:58.134 --> 07:59.600
Well?

08:01.471 --> 08:03.104
Well what?

08:03.106 --> 08:07.141
The crimes you've committed
against your crew are undisputed.

08:07.143 --> 08:10.061
The only reason the sentence
hasn't been carried out

08:10.063 --> 08:12.396
is that I've been delaying the vote

08:12.398 --> 08:15.700
in hopes that you might help me
find a way to get that gold,

08:15.702 --> 08:18.819
or as much of it as
possible, off that beach.

08:20.206 --> 08:22.623
Why would I do that?

08:22.625 --> 08:24.125
Because if you do,

08:24.127 --> 08:27.578
I'll personally guarantee
your sentences are commuted.

08:29.248 --> 08:31.832
You'll guarantee that, will you?

08:31.834 --> 08:34.751
You underestimate
your men yet again.

08:34.754 --> 08:36.671
They will hear reason,

08:36.673 --> 08:39.756
especially when it comes
from a voice they can trust.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.844
The men feel they're entitled
to leave this ordeal

08:43.846 --> 08:46.013
- with something to show for...
- Fuck those men.

08:48.768 --> 08:50.985
Fuck them for their shortsightedness.

08:50.987 --> 08:53.237
Fuck them for their ingratitude.

08:53.239 --> 08:56.157
And fuck them for siding
with a cowardly,

08:56.159 --> 08:58.693
sniveling shit of a mutineer.

08:58.695 --> 09:01.996
There are over 100
soldiers on that beach,

09:01.998 --> 09:04.999
sworn upon their lives
to protect that gold.

09:05.001 --> 09:07.168
In a matter of hours,

09:07.170 --> 09:09.620
they'll dispatch teams
to search for threats.

09:09.622 --> 09:11.505
In a matter of days,

09:11.507 --> 09:14.792
they'll locate our wreck
and our camp,

09:14.794 --> 09:19.764
and they will kill every
last member of your crew.

09:19.766 --> 09:22.850
And they'll deserve it,

09:22.852 --> 09:24.969
none more so than you.

09:31.644 --> 09:34.645
Bring them back.

09:34.647 --> 09:36.981
We'll ready the nooses.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.496
Wait.

09:58.838 --> 10:01.839
The Urca's gold is secure.

10:01.841 --> 10:03.808
A full complement of soldiers,

10:03.810 --> 10:07.728
reinforced batteries...
18-pounders, all of them...

10:07.730 --> 10:09.680
and men who know how to use them.

10:09.682 --> 10:13.017
There's no way of approaching
that beach from the land.

10:13.019 --> 10:14.902
Why the fuck are we
listening to him?

10:14.904 --> 10:16.320
- (Men shouting)
- Yeah, why?

10:16.322 --> 10:18.155
We should be cutting
your goddamn tongue out

10:18.157 --> 10:20.024
for all the lies you've told us.

10:20.026 --> 10:21.909
Gentlemen!

10:21.911 --> 10:25.029
No one is angrier about
Mr. Flint's crimes than I.

10:25.031 --> 10:26.747
Which is why you must trust me

10:26.749 --> 10:29.033
when I ask you to hear
what he has to say.

10:32.038 --> 10:34.205
And even if it weren't
for the soldiers,

10:34.207 --> 10:36.757
even if it weren't for the guns,

10:36.759 --> 10:40.127
there's a fucking warship watching
over every inch of the bay...

10:40.129 --> 10:44.181
a fucking warship that has
already killed half your number,

10:44.183 --> 10:47.218
a fucking warship that
would prevent any approach

10:47.220 --> 10:50.020
to that beach via the sea.

10:50.022 --> 10:53.224
There's simply no way
of stealing that gold.

10:56.145 --> 10:58.612
But there might be something
else you can steal.

11:01.534 --> 11:03.067
The fucking warship.

11:03.069 --> 11:05.820
(Man chuckles)

11:05.822 --> 11:07.071
What?

11:09.242 --> 11:12.159
Too many soldiers
on the beach, which means

11:12.161 --> 11:14.962
that the watch on the ship is spare.

11:14.964 --> 11:17.882
Two men approach quietly,

11:17.884 --> 11:20.134
evade a handful of sentries

11:20.136 --> 11:23.087
and eliminate the watch
on the mainmast.

11:23.089 --> 11:24.805
Now at this point,

11:24.807 --> 11:27.057
while the sun is failing

11:27.059 --> 11:29.059
but before the night watch arrives,

11:29.061 --> 11:31.228
an assault could be made.

11:33.232 --> 11:35.566
That ship

11:35.568 --> 11:37.768
is your only means of escape.

11:37.770 --> 11:40.271
And that ship is your only means

11:40.273 --> 11:42.656
of taking anything of value

11:42.658 --> 11:44.942
out of this ordeal.

11:44.944 --> 11:47.077
And once it is in your possession...

11:47.079 --> 11:48.946
- Enough of this.
- Once that ship is in your possession...

11:48.948 --> 11:50.948
- Do none of you remember his crimes?
- Mr. De Groot!

11:50.950 --> 11:54.034
Once that ship is in your
possession, you will be invincible!

12:04.630 --> 12:06.964
Now the risk

12:06.966 --> 12:09.934
falls almost entirely
on the first two men out.

12:11.637 --> 12:13.804
I would volunteer

12:13.806 --> 12:15.773
in exchange for your pardon.

12:17.109 --> 12:19.109
That leaves one man to go.

12:23.316 --> 12:24.698
One volunteer...

12:24.700 --> 12:26.033
I'll do it.

12:30.239 --> 12:32.957
I'll... I'll go.

12:37.914 --> 12:39.997
(Sighs)

12:39.999 --> 12:42.833
DUFRESNE: Then let's put
Mr. Flint's plan to a vote.

12:42.835 --> 12:44.218
All in favor?

12:49.091 --> 12:52.226
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!

12:52.228 --> 12:54.011
- (Tower bells ringing)
- (Gavel banging)

12:54.013 --> 12:55.846
MAN:
The ayes have it.

12:55.847 --> 13:00.068
__

13:04.406 --> 13:06.406
Whoa.

13:19.888 --> 13:22.005
Lord Thomas Hamilton?

13:22.007 --> 13:24.557
Ah.

13:24.559 --> 13:26.559
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

13:27.679 --> 13:29.763
I am, my lord.

13:29.765 --> 13:33.016
They say it started with
a man named Henry Avery.

13:33.018 --> 13:36.019
Sailed into the port of Nassau,

13:36.021 --> 13:38.855
bribed the colonial governor
to look past his sins,

13:38.857 --> 13:40.990
encamped his crew upon the beach,

13:40.992 --> 13:44.494
and thus began the pirate issue
on New Providence Island.

13:44.496 --> 13:47.330
Where and when will it all end?

13:47.332 --> 13:50.366
I suppose that's where you
and I come into the story.

13:50.368 --> 13:53.002
As I'm sure you're aware, my
father the earl holds great sway

13:53.004 --> 13:54.704
amongst his peers in Whitehall.

13:54.706 --> 13:57.540
He has asked for the assistance
of Her Majesty's Navy

13:57.542 --> 14:00.543
in pacifying the island
to which he holds title.

14:00.545 --> 14:02.512
He was assured that this
request would be considered

14:02.514 --> 14:05.098
- a matter of the utmost importance.
- Undoubtedly, my lord.

14:05.100 --> 14:09.052
Then perhaps you can tell me
why they decided to send you.

14:09.054 --> 14:10.687
Beg pardon, my lord?

14:12.390 --> 14:15.725
A number of your superiors are
former schoolmates of mine.

14:15.727 --> 14:18.695
I canvassed them
about your reputation...

14:18.697 --> 14:20.814
the son of a carpenter,

14:20.816 --> 14:22.565
no record of any formal schooling,

14:22.567 --> 14:26.953
and yet more literate than any
three boys I knew at Eton.

14:26.955 --> 14:29.239
You are a rising star

14:29.241 --> 14:31.458
with a bright future
in the Admiralty.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.959
You can understand my concern.

14:32.961 --> 14:34.961
Not really.

14:34.963 --> 14:36.746
Perhaps my lack of
education is showing.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.418
I intend to accomplish
something here, Lieutenant.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.256
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

14:46.258 --> 14:48.258
And I cannot do that with a partner

14:48.260 --> 14:50.310
who might be more concerned
about advancing his career

14:50.312 --> 14:52.929
than he is about realizing this goal.

14:57.736 --> 14:59.986
- You want to save Nassau, my lord?
- Very much so.

14:59.988 --> 15:03.773
Then perhaps my job is to make certain
you know what you're getting into.

15:38.777 --> 15:41.394
(Woman moaning loudly)

15:43.732 --> 15:45.815
(Man grunting)

15:45.817 --> 15:48.735
(Both sigh)

15:48.737 --> 15:50.954
You can go in now.

16:09.841 --> 16:11.758
I'll go get us some rum.

16:15.013 --> 16:16.679
Where the fuck were you today?

16:16.681 --> 16:19.732
Here.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.985
You wanted to be a partner to
the consortium, did you not?

16:21.987 --> 16:24.320
You wanted to take Hornigold's
seat at the table?

16:24.322 --> 16:26.656
Then that means you assume
Hornigold's responsibilities,

16:26.658 --> 16:28.908
first among them... turning
up for the fucking meetings.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.527
Is this really what
you came up here for...

16:31.529 --> 16:33.746
scold me for truancy?

16:33.748 --> 16:35.615
This morning somebody
killed two watchmen

16:35.617 --> 16:38.668
and stole 500 pounds' worth
of cargo from the warehouse.

16:38.670 --> 16:39.953
Sorry to hear that.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.255
Don't be sorry.
Do your fucking job.

16:42.257 --> 16:44.674
And what job is that exactly?

16:44.676 --> 16:47.710
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

16:47.712 --> 16:51.347
And you'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

16:51.349 --> 16:54.183
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

16:54.185 --> 16:56.953
then I argue they aren't
worth protecting.

16:56.955 --> 16:58.955
What the fuck
are you talking about?

16:58.957 --> 17:01.458
You were the one who decided you
wanted to be a part of this.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.293
To protect the bay.

17:03.295 --> 17:05.345
But to play the role of constable

17:05.347 --> 17:09.299
for the benefit of Captains
Naft and Lawrence?

17:09.300 --> 17:11.718
Your problem isn't with me.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.805
Your problem... you need
stronger partners.

17:14.807 --> 17:16.973
I had stronger partners, you shit.

17:16.974 --> 17:18.775
What are you doing
down there, Eleanor?

17:18.777 --> 17:21.310
Corporate charters?
Mandatory meetings?

17:21.313 --> 17:22.779
The woman who stole ship and
crew out from underneath me

17:22.781 --> 17:24.948
has no appetite for any of that.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.867
I think that's why you're
so frustrated with me...

17:26.868 --> 17:29.286
because you know all this,
because you know I know this,

17:29.288 --> 17:31.822
and because you know
you are so much more like me

17:31.824 --> 17:33.651
than anyone you've ever met
in your entire life.

17:33.673 --> 17:36.460
Jesus Christ, enough. Stop telling me
what it is you think I think.

17:36.462 --> 17:38.829
You sound fucking ridiculous.

17:38.831 --> 17:40.831
Do you know what it is I want?

17:40.833 --> 17:43.333
I want to figure out a way of
selling everyone's shit here

17:43.335 --> 17:45.552
for more tomorrow
than I did yesterday.

17:45.554 --> 17:48.338
I want to establish a future here
that isn't measured in months.

17:48.340 --> 17:52.309
And I want you to show up for a
meeting when you're fucking told.

17:52.311 --> 17:54.511
- Can't leave yet.
- Watch me.

17:54.513 --> 17:56.646
You haven't asked me
the question yet.

17:56.648 --> 17:59.015
You haven't asked me if
I'm gonna let him in...

17:59.017 --> 18:01.518
Flint.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.489
Am I going to permit him to enter
the bay with his Spanish treasure?

18:05.491 --> 18:08.525
Assuming, that is,
he returns with it at all.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.667
Be very careful, Charles,

18:17.669 --> 18:20.003
because at a certain point

18:20.005 --> 18:22.956
I will remove you from this place,
no matter what the consequences.

18:22.958 --> 18:25.592
You'd do that? For him?

18:27.880 --> 18:30.797
How is it you see such a partner
in him and such a villain in me?

18:30.799 --> 18:32.299
He wants what I want.

18:32.301 --> 18:34.351
Are you quite certain about that?

18:34.353 --> 18:37.020
Let's put it to a test.

18:37.022 --> 18:39.890
Let's say I do separate
Flint from his gold

18:39.892 --> 18:41.358
when he returns.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.978
And let's say you and I split it.

18:46.315 --> 18:47.814
What?

18:47.816 --> 18:50.283
Mm, see?

18:50.285 --> 18:52.235
Not so easy.

18:52.237 --> 18:54.738
Think about it... I kill Flint,

18:54.740 --> 18:56.957
give you half a fortune,
and then no more Naft,

18:56.959 --> 18:58.959
no more Lawrence,
no more compromises.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.328
You could do whatever you like.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.714
We could do whatever we like.

19:06.335 --> 19:08.635
How important is Flint to you now?

19:11.924 --> 19:14.341
Fuck you.

19:14.343 --> 19:16.309
Fuck you, too.

19:24.319 --> 19:26.319
Once the mainmast watch
has been eliminated,

19:26.321 --> 19:27.854
hoist your signal.

19:27.856 --> 19:29.823
If there is no signal
before the reinforcements

19:29.825 --> 19:31.608
for the night's watch
depart the beach,

19:31.610 --> 19:34.945
I'll assume failure and begin
our escape down the coast.

19:36.615 --> 19:38.331
What if the signal is in time?

19:38.333 --> 19:40.584
Then we'll launch our assault.

19:42.621 --> 19:46.339
There is something about which
I want to be very clear...

19:46.341 --> 19:48.291
even in success

19:48.293 --> 19:51.294
you will be expelled from the crew,

19:51.296 --> 19:52.762
cast out.

19:55.551 --> 19:57.717
Are we understood?

20:22.377 --> 20:23.493
You shit.

20:25.047 --> 20:26.963
Um, beg pardon?

20:26.965 --> 20:29.716
I needed a fighter,

20:29.718 --> 20:33.503
someone I could count on to
make a difference on that ship.

20:33.505 --> 20:35.505
What the fuck were you doing
volunteering?

20:37.509 --> 20:39.092
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

20:39.094 --> 20:42.062
Why wouldn't I volunteer?
If we're to try and...

20:43.482 --> 20:45.849
Hang on.

20:45.851 --> 20:48.018
You're serious
about taking the ship?

20:48.020 --> 20:49.653
What the fuck did you think?

20:49.655 --> 20:51.438
I thought this was how
you intended to escape.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.523
(Sighs)

20:53.525 --> 20:56.359
Sure, it would be a few days of
walking or so to St. Augustine,

20:56.361 --> 20:58.028
but at least we'd have a chance.

21:00.449 --> 21:03.533
You really mean to board that ship.
Jesus Christ.

21:03.535 --> 21:05.702
I'm not doing it.

21:05.704 --> 21:07.370
I don't need to return to Nassau.

21:07.372 --> 21:10.373
I am happy to find some
other place to survive.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.676
St. Augustine is that way.

21:16.381 --> 21:18.431
It's at least a week on foot,

21:18.433 --> 21:21.768
Tequesta tribes in between.

21:21.770 --> 21:24.387
I doubt you'll survive
to see sunrise tomorrow.

21:26.058 --> 21:28.608
How are you even gonna get
out there with one arm?

22:04.846 --> 22:08.315
HAMILTON: What is this exercise
intended to prove, Lieutenant?

22:08.317 --> 22:10.600
FLINT: You want to understand
why piracy flourishes

22:10.602 --> 22:12.018
in the West Indies.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.321
I'm about to show you.

22:14.323 --> 22:16.606
- (Crowd shouting)
- Have you seen one of these before?

22:16.608 --> 22:18.108
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

22:18.110 --> 22:19.693
Who is he?

22:19.695 --> 22:21.328
Davey someone-or-other.

22:21.330 --> 22:24.030
High seas piracy, treason,
so on and so forth,

22:24.032 --> 22:26.032
same as the last, same as the next.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.585
He's being asked
if he wants to confess,

22:28.587 --> 22:31.921
beg forgiveness in the eyes
of God and Queen Anne.

22:31.923 --> 22:34.874
- Suck my cock!
- (Crowd shouting)

22:34.876 --> 22:36.343
I assume that was a "no."

22:38.096 --> 22:40.296
So this is the lesson...

22:40.298 --> 22:42.966
the pirates of New Providence Island

22:42.968 --> 22:45.301
are incorrigible,
dedicated to mayhem.

22:45.303 --> 22:48.638
To attempt to address this subject
is doomed to defeat from the outset.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.974
It's not him I wanted you to see.

22:53.111 --> 22:55.528
- (Crowd cheering)
- MAN: No mercy!

22:58.066 --> 23:00.450
Go all the way to hell!

23:00.452 --> 23:02.369
It's them.

23:03.622 --> 23:06.456
Civilization needs its monsters.

23:06.458 --> 23:09.042
You think Whitehall wants piracy
to flourish in the Bahamas?

23:09.044 --> 23:11.294
No, I don't think they want
it, but I think they're aware

23:11.296 --> 23:13.997
of the cost associated
with trying to fight it.

23:13.999 --> 23:16.416
And I think that that sound

23:16.418 --> 23:19.386
travels.

23:19.388 --> 23:22.422
You're an educated man, my lord,
but I think it worth reminding you

23:22.424 --> 23:25.091
that in most cases a man trying
to change the world fails

23:25.093 --> 23:28.511
for one simple
and unavoidable reason...

23:28.513 --> 23:30.013
everyone else.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.051
Do as I say when I say,

24:09.053 --> 24:11.303
or I'll kill you myself.

24:47.508 --> 24:49.424
Well, that was easy.

25:07.361 --> 25:09.361
(Flies buzzing)

25:09.363 --> 25:11.864
(Donkey braying)

25:17.788 --> 25:20.873
- (Knocks on door)
- MAN: Hurry up!

25:20.875 --> 25:23.292
(Quietly) I will fucking kill you.
Shut up.

25:25.379 --> 25:28.463
(Knocks on door)

25:28.465 --> 25:30.465
For crying out loud!

25:33.270 --> 25:34.887
10 minutes I've been waiting.

25:34.889 --> 25:36.939
A moment's peace, my friend.

25:36.941 --> 25:39.308
Surely you can empathize.

25:45.866 --> 25:48.367
Jack Rackham.

25:49.987 --> 25:51.987
The crew killer.

26:11.342 --> 26:14.843
That's right.

26:38.786 --> 26:40.786
Jesus.

26:40.788 --> 26:42.537
What happened?

26:42.539 --> 26:44.373
Same as yesterday,

26:44.375 --> 26:46.458
though it would appear
things have escalated.

26:48.379 --> 26:51.130
When I came here, I had nothing

26:51.132 --> 26:53.349
but my name and my wits.

26:53.351 --> 26:55.351
A man in a place like this

26:55.353 --> 26:58.053
surviving on those
two things alone...

26:58.055 --> 27:00.055
he suffers indignities,

27:00.057 --> 27:03.058
slights, ridicule.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.977
But I overcame it.

27:04.979 --> 27:07.029
I used the wits to build the name.

27:07.031 --> 27:10.483
I became quartermaster to a crew

27:10.485 --> 27:12.401
that struck fear into the hearts

27:12.403 --> 27:15.488
of many, many men.

27:15.490 --> 27:17.573
Jesus Christ,

27:17.575 --> 27:19.742
what's become of my name?

27:22.130 --> 27:24.130
(Sniffs)

27:24.132 --> 27:26.165
They pissed on me.

27:29.137 --> 27:30.970
Tell me who did this.

27:30.972 --> 27:33.139
(Laughs)

27:33.141 --> 27:35.591
So you can murder them all?

27:35.593 --> 27:37.593
What a wonderful idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

27:37.595 --> 27:39.512
Tell me, though,
how many men do you think

27:39.514 --> 27:42.431
you can safely lure into the
wrecks to their deaths?

27:42.433 --> 27:44.600
Unfortunately, I'm afraid
eight won't cut it,

27:44.602 --> 27:47.903
as I am pariah to just about
every able-bodied man

27:47.905 --> 27:50.606
on this fucking island!

27:57.248 --> 27:59.114
They pissed on me.

28:21.522 --> 28:24.473
I will send someone
upstairs to tend to him.

28:24.475 --> 28:26.642
He is angry, but this will pass.

28:26.644 --> 28:28.611
Stay the fuck away from me.

29:38.549 --> 29:40.015
(Muffled cry)

29:59.737 --> 30:01.987
- Wait.
- You almost got us killed.

30:01.989 --> 30:05.157
- Almost. Almost.
- For a fucking bauble.

30:05.159 --> 30:06.742
It's a boatswain's whistle.

30:06.744 --> 30:08.911
Look.

30:08.913 --> 30:11.246
Doesn't it make more sense for us
to prompt the lookout to come down,

30:11.248 --> 30:14.833
than for us to go
up there after him?

30:14.835 --> 30:16.919
You are truly amazing,
you know that?

30:16.921 --> 30:19.638
We're both better off now
than we were two minutes ago,

30:19.640 --> 30:22.591
yet you're angry about it because
it didn't happen your way.

30:22.593 --> 30:25.010
Might you consider
for a fucking moment

30:25.012 --> 30:28.230
that your distrust of me
is completely unwarranted?

30:28.232 --> 30:31.183
I warned you about Billy.
Was I right?

30:31.185 --> 30:33.152
I found you over Mr. Gates's body,

30:33.154 --> 30:36.071
and did I do anything
but defend you?

30:36.073 --> 30:38.691
When you were sinking
to the bottom of the sea,

30:38.693 --> 30:41.193
who do you imagine it was who
dragged you onto that beach?

30:42.580 --> 30:44.580
Brace yourself,

30:44.582 --> 30:47.616
but I'm the only person within
a hundred miles of here

30:47.618 --> 30:50.098
- who doesn't want to see you dead.
- (Men speaking Spanish)

31:05.186 --> 31:06.802
(Thuds)

31:16.814 --> 31:18.781
(Blows whistle)

32:53.077 --> 32:55.711
But this is the rate I can
offer you for this material.

32:55.713 --> 32:58.297
If it's unsatisfactory,
feel free to go elsewhere.

32:58.299 --> 33:02.084
This is absurd. There's absolutely
nothing wrong with the cargo itself.

33:02.086 --> 33:03.802
What's going on here?

33:03.804 --> 33:06.922
Ma'am, these goods were
presented for consignment,

33:06.924 --> 33:09.258
but your man here refuses
to pay full freight for it,

33:09.260 --> 33:10.926
owing to the condition
of the barrels they're in.

33:10.928 --> 33:12.811
Put up a fight, did they?

33:12.813 --> 33:15.764
Once we were on board, the crew
turned, gave us no choice.

33:15.766 --> 33:17.566
There was no malice in it.

33:17.568 --> 33:19.101
Mister...

33:19.103 --> 33:21.270
Meeks, ma'am. Quartermaster
of the Fancy.

33:21.272 --> 33:24.823
Mr. Meeks, do you have
any idea what happens

33:24.825 --> 33:27.826
when a marginally reputable cargo
ship enters a civilized port

33:27.828 --> 33:31.280
and attempts to unload 50 barrels
full of cargo covered in blood?

33:31.282 --> 33:33.582
This material all must be unboxed

33:33.584 --> 33:37.619
and reboxed into clean containers before
I can even think about shipping it out.

33:37.621 --> 33:40.589
Between you and I, which of us
should bear the cost of that?

33:42.626 --> 33:45.210
Whatever happened on that ship,
it was a costly fuck-up.

33:45.212 --> 33:47.796
But it wasn't my fuck-up, and
I'm not about to pay for it.

33:47.798 --> 33:51.550
Ma'am, I must beg your understanding.

33:51.552 --> 33:53.802
My crew is new to this place.

33:53.804 --> 33:56.188
Going forward, we'll certainly
keep this issue in mind.

33:56.190 --> 33:58.640
Mr. Meeks, who is
the captain of the Fancy?

33:58.642 --> 34:00.559
Ned Low.

34:02.062 --> 34:03.812
Please relay to Captain Low

34:03.814 --> 34:06.198
that it is his responsibility
to manage the taking of prizes

34:06.200 --> 34:08.317
to avoid situations like
this in the future.

34:08.319 --> 34:10.652
If there are any savings in
the repacking of these goods,

34:10.654 --> 34:12.154
I'll be sure to pass them on to you.

34:12.156 --> 34:13.956
Good afternoon.

34:26.503 --> 34:28.085
Madam Guthrie.

34:29.505 --> 34:30.839
You wished to speak with me?

34:31.842 --> 34:33.559
Sit.

34:43.187 --> 34:45.520
Do you know Captain Hallendale
of the Straight Arrow?

34:45.522 --> 34:47.188
Yes.

34:47.190 --> 34:49.440
Not terribly strong or daring,

34:49.443 --> 34:51.827
but knows how to manage a
prize, reliable in that way.

34:51.829 --> 34:53.829
Sorry, what has this
got to do with me?

34:53.831 --> 34:55.447
The Good Fortune
was captured yesterday

34:55.449 --> 34:57.866
but by a different captain
who found her first,

34:57.868 --> 35:00.202
beat Hallendale to her,

35:00.204 --> 35:02.504
and then, instead of
managing her surrender,

35:02.506 --> 35:05.207
he put her entire crew
to the sword.

35:05.209 --> 35:06.708
I give Hallendale a lead.

35:06.710 --> 35:09.628
Hallendale spends all his time in here.

35:09.630 --> 35:12.631
And somehow that lead ends up in
the hands of a fucking maniac.

35:12.633 --> 35:14.850
Madam Guthrie,
isn't it just as possible

35:14.852 --> 35:17.052
this is a rather unfortunate but not
at all implausible coincidence?

35:17.054 --> 35:18.553
I sold it.

35:19.890 --> 35:22.608
To Captain Low.
He paid 90 pieces for it.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.562
- Why would you do...?
- Why wouldn't I?

35:30.008 --> 35:33.068
Valuable information walks in the
door, I should let it walk out?

35:33.070 --> 35:36.405
Why? Because it bothers you?

35:42.212 --> 35:44.546
Stay out of my fucking business.

35:44.548 --> 35:47.466
Consider this the only warning
you're ever gonna get.

35:50.504 --> 35:53.555
- You fucking ingrate.
- Now that's not helpful.

35:53.557 --> 35:55.674
You mewed and whimpered
in that fucking tent

35:55.676 --> 35:57.592
till you had me all turned around.

35:57.594 --> 36:00.512
Got me thinking you were some
helpless thing they was beatin' on.

36:00.514 --> 36:02.564
I get you out, and you pull this shit.

36:02.566 --> 36:05.517
- Starting shit without telling us.
- Let me explain.

36:05.519 --> 36:08.153
- Don't you fucking talk back to me.
- All right.

36:08.155 --> 36:10.856
Either she's on her back,
or she's out on the streets.

36:10.858 --> 36:13.525
But if it ain't one of
the two come tomorrow,

36:13.527 --> 36:15.577
I'm gonna deal with it my way.

36:26.457 --> 36:30.042
I will be very honest with you.

36:30.044 --> 36:33.011
I could torture the two of you
to find out who you are,

36:33.013 --> 36:34.680
how many more of you there are

36:34.682 --> 36:36.682
and what you're hoping
to accomplish here.

36:36.684 --> 36:40.469
I could find it out
and you would both suffer.

36:40.471 --> 36:44.773
But today is your lucky day,
at least for one of you.

36:44.775 --> 36:46.641
My commander arrives

36:46.643 --> 36:48.777
to relieve the watch
in less than an hour.

36:48.779 --> 36:51.480
I need this matter
resolved before then.

36:51.482 --> 36:54.232
So neither of you will
be here when he arrives.

36:54.234 --> 36:56.818
One of you will tell me
what I want to know,

36:56.820 --> 36:58.236
receive this gold as reward,

36:58.238 --> 37:00.205
be escorted to the beach
for your escape.

37:00.207 --> 37:01.707
And the other will be quite dead.

37:01.709 --> 37:03.658
My name is John Silver.
His name is James Flint.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.961
We came here to steal the gold
from the treasure galleon,

37:05.963 --> 37:08.830
but he was deposed from his
captaincy by a man named Dufresne,

37:08.832 --> 37:10.916
who is now waiting with the
rest of our crew in longboats.

37:10.918 --> 37:12.834
You'll likely find them behind
the promontory to the south.

37:12.836 --> 37:15.670
I believe there are 32 of them.

37:15.672 --> 37:17.172
You fucking...!

37:25.232 --> 37:26.982
Suéltalo.

37:38.495 --> 37:39.528
Sorry.

37:54.545 --> 37:56.545
Huh-uh.

38:01.218 --> 38:02.968
Shoot this one.

38:02.970 --> 38:04.386
He'll get to the pistol.

38:04.388 --> 38:06.381
This one has more scars...
more fights.

38:06.382 --> 38:07.977
You've got a better chance
against this one.

38:07.978 --> 38:10.640
- Not if he shoots me first.
- Then beat him to it. Do it, quickly.

38:10.645 --> 38:12.444
So I actually have to fight him?

38:12.446 --> 38:14.613
Well, what the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

38:14.615 --> 38:16.982
Do it! Do it!

38:58.326 --> 39:00.609
(Men shouting in Spanish)

39:03.364 --> 39:05.331
Bolt the door.

39:12.456 --> 39:16.542
Busquen algo para derrimbar
la puerta, apúrense!

39:16.544 --> 39:18.010
Table.

39:25.603 --> 39:27.553
So what now?

39:27.555 --> 39:30.022
They'll have to converge through
the door, roughly a dozen of them,

39:30.024 --> 39:32.141
and three pistols at our disposal.

39:32.143 --> 39:33.976
And then what?

39:48.492 --> 39:50.492
(Whistle blows)

39:55.299 --> 39:59.635
(Man shouting in Spanish)

40:03.340 --> 40:05.307
Hold your fire.

40:22.026 --> 40:24.109
Mr. Logan, weigh the anchor!

40:24.111 --> 40:27.279
We must get underway before they
loose those cannons on the beach.

40:27.281 --> 40:31.033
Up the braces! Up the braces!
Unfold the canvas!

40:32.703 --> 40:34.620
Come on!

40:43.297 --> 40:46.715
- Return fire!
- Return fire!

40:53.441 --> 40:56.108
DUFRESNE:
Cannons are loaded!

40:56.110 --> 40:59.394
Get us underway! Get us underway!

41:04.285 --> 41:06.235
Prepare to take fire!

41:11.075 --> 41:12.374
MAN:
Incoming!

41:45.659 --> 41:47.609
BONNY:
...the fucking island.

41:47.611 --> 41:51.029
...that Guthrie cunt...

41:51.031 --> 41:52.531
Now get the fuck out.

41:52.533 --> 41:55.117
RACKHAM:
All right. Fuck!

42:05.796 --> 42:08.797
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

42:08.799 --> 42:11.466
Though I would recommend
avoiding her for a while.

42:33.157 --> 42:34.740
Get the fuck out.

42:46.303 --> 42:50.088
If we are all going to make
something of this place,

42:50.090 --> 42:53.091
perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

42:53.093 --> 42:56.478
that you and I find a way
past all of this,

42:56.480 --> 42:58.513
past your anger towards me.

42:58.515 --> 43:01.149
I'm not gonna warn you again.

43:02.820 --> 43:06.438
Your anger... it is understandable.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.574
You killed your own crew
to free me.

43:08.576 --> 43:12.494
You suffered indignity
in my defense.

43:12.496 --> 43:15.414
Perhaps that is enough
to warrant your feelings.

43:19.169 --> 43:22.421
But perhaps there is something
else underlying it,

43:22.423 --> 43:26.091
something hiding in a place
not even you can see.

43:28.429 --> 43:31.179
Perhaps...

43:31.181 --> 43:34.049
we would do well to...

43:34.051 --> 43:36.018
bring it into the light.

43:37.993 --> 43:39.554
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

43:39.556 --> 43:41.974
Huh?

44:17.061 --> 44:18.593
Ma'am.

44:22.232 --> 44:23.932
May I buy that for you, miss?

44:23.934 --> 44:27.269
My bar. Thank you anyway.

44:28.605 --> 44:30.989
I confess,

44:30.991 --> 44:33.108
I knew it was your bar.

44:33.110 --> 44:35.577
Just a gesture for a pretty lady.

44:35.579 --> 44:37.362
You must be new here.

44:37.364 --> 44:38.997
I am, in fact. How could you tell?

44:40.951 --> 44:42.668
I don't fuck customers.

44:42.670 --> 44:45.671
Everybody here knows it.
Now you do, too.

44:45.673 --> 44:47.673
A sound rule.

44:47.675 --> 44:50.509
Unfortunate for me,
but sound nonetheless.

44:50.511 --> 44:53.628
Still, it is unthinkable to me

44:53.630 --> 44:56.965
that someone this beautiful is
forced to spend her nights alone.

44:56.967 --> 44:59.134
What's your name?

44:59.136 --> 45:00.185
Ned Low.

45:01.972 --> 45:04.306
You met my quartermaster
Meeks this morning.

45:04.308 --> 45:06.224
From what I understand,
we were shortchanged

45:06.226 --> 45:07.976
a fair amount on a prize haul

45:07.978 --> 45:10.112
owing to the condition
of its containers.

45:10.114 --> 45:12.030
I understand
Mr. Meeks told you

45:12.032 --> 45:14.149
the episode on the Good Fortune
was a case of self-defense.

45:14.151 --> 45:15.984
I apologize for that.

45:15.986 --> 45:17.736
When I heard he told you
that, I knew instantly

45:17.738 --> 45:20.455
that a woman of your stature
would see right through it.

45:20.457 --> 45:24.159
And if you're anything like me,
you simply cannot abide a liar.

45:24.161 --> 45:27.162
So I thought if I came
here to tell the truth,

45:27.164 --> 45:32.217
perhaps we might reach
a more favorable outcome.

45:32.836 --> 45:34.719
The truth is,

45:34.721 --> 45:38.006
I'm not a particularly
skilled captain.

45:38.008 --> 45:39.674
Navigation is foreign to me.

45:39.676 --> 45:41.676
I have no gift for politics.

45:41.678 --> 45:43.845
So what am I good at?

45:43.847 --> 45:47.098
This is going to sound
absurd, but...

45:47.100 --> 45:50.018
I make the men feel better
about themselves.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.020
See, every man here
has served under a captain

45:52.022 --> 45:53.855
who uses violence
to achieve an end...

45:53.857 --> 45:57.191
to terrorize, to advertise.

45:57.193 --> 45:59.827
When the men see that,
they can spot the lie.

45:59.829 --> 46:03.114
They know that that captain
is, in some part of his soul,

46:03.116 --> 46:06.451
sickened by his own actions.

46:06.453 --> 46:09.037
And the lie infects
everyone who sees it.

46:09.039 --> 46:11.039
But with me,

46:11.041 --> 46:13.541
when the men see me slaughter
the crew of the Good Fortune,

46:13.543 --> 46:16.711
when they see me cut out a man's
tongue from his mouth for lying,

46:16.713 --> 46:18.963
when they see me burn a boy alive
in front of his father's eyes,

46:18.965 --> 46:22.717
they know, they can
see it in my eyes...

46:22.719 --> 46:24.852
there's no lie there.

46:24.854 --> 46:27.639
There's no secret remorse there.

46:30.310 --> 46:32.560
I simply don't have it in me.

46:35.565 --> 46:39.534
At any rate, I hope
that clarifies things

46:39.536 --> 46:41.703
and illustrates why it is only fair

46:41.705 --> 46:45.623
to compensate my men fully
for their latest haul,

46:45.625 --> 46:49.794
as it was an honest haul
taken by an honest captain.

46:49.796 --> 46:51.913
I intend to be here some time.

46:51.915 --> 46:54.666
It would be a shame to
make enemies of each other

46:54.668 --> 46:56.801
over such a small amount of money.

46:58.722 --> 47:00.838
Get out of my place.

47:23.279 --> 47:25.580
(Men chattering)

47:29.369 --> 47:31.619
MAN:
I say get rid of him.

47:48.605 --> 47:50.605
It's very lucky.

47:53.693 --> 47:56.444
I rather envy you.

48:04.320 --> 48:08.322
I remember what it was like
the first time I met him.

48:08.324 --> 48:10.658
There's a feeling one gets
when in the presence

48:10.660 --> 48:13.244
of the truly great men.

48:13.246 --> 48:16.831
It's something quite indescribable.

48:16.833 --> 48:19.884
I imagine you're
having it as we speak.

48:19.886 --> 48:22.253
"Indescribable" is a good word.

48:22.255 --> 48:24.172
You question my husband's motives?

48:24.174 --> 48:26.174
Not on the least, ma'am,

48:26.176 --> 48:28.393
though I may question the
outcome he's likely to achieve.

48:28.395 --> 48:30.428
The game he is entering into

48:30.430 --> 48:32.930
is a brutal and unforgiving one.

48:32.932 --> 48:35.733
- Piracy?
- Politics.

48:35.735 --> 48:39.187
What's your name, Lieutenant?

48:39.189 --> 48:42.240
McGraw... James McGraw.

48:42.242 --> 48:45.743
Great men aren't made great by
politics, Lieutenant McGraw.

48:45.745 --> 48:49.363
They aren't made great
by prudence or propriety.

48:49.365 --> 48:51.365
They are, every last one of them,

48:51.367 --> 48:55.286
made great by one thing
and one thing only...

48:55.288 --> 48:59.090
the relentless pursuit
of a better world.

48:59.092 --> 49:01.375
The great men don't
give up that pursuit.

49:01.377 --> 49:03.377
They don't know how.

49:03.379 --> 49:06.347
And that is what makes
them invincible.

49:26.035 --> 49:29.036
17 yea votes against 15 nays.

49:30.406 --> 49:33.157
The crew has commuted your sentences

49:33.159 --> 49:36.744
by the narrowest of margins.

49:36.746 --> 49:40.248
You will both be
transported back to Nassau,

49:40.250 --> 49:43.334
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently

49:43.336 --> 49:45.419
and without severance.

49:47.307 --> 49:50.391
There'll be no further
negotiation on the matter.

50:01.855 --> 50:05.406
You were right, for what it's worth.

50:05.408 --> 50:07.158
Beg pardon?

50:07.160 --> 50:11.362
If your interests and mine
were adverse to each other,

50:11.364 --> 50:14.949
there's a good chance I'd
cross you to save myself.

50:14.951 --> 50:17.451
Then why didn't you?

50:17.453 --> 50:19.837
Because at the moment

50:19.839 --> 50:22.206
I don't believe our interests
are adverse to each other.

50:28.464 --> 50:31.299
I don't believe you did
any of this for a pardon,

50:31.301 --> 50:34.135
or a passage to Nassau,

50:34.137 --> 50:37.471
or to be able to walk away
from anything.

50:37.473 --> 50:41.475
I think you intend
to reclaim your captaincy.

50:41.477 --> 50:46.113
I think you intend to take
control of this ship.

50:46.115 --> 50:47.865
And then I think you intend

50:47.867 --> 50:50.484
to return to that beach,
armed to the teeth,

50:50.486 --> 50:53.487
and seize every last
ounce of gold off of it.

50:55.491 --> 50:58.075
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

51:06.302 --> 51:08.252
Tell me I'm wrong.
