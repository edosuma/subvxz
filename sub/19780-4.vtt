I want to get these announcements made.

00:10.599 --> 00:13.105
We're not exactly on the same

00:13.106 --> 00:14.720
nice bunnies.

00:14.721 --> 00:16.824
I don't think you're allowed
to comment on my bunnies

Oh, well, you know what?
Before you say anything,

01:37.352 --> 01:38.855
yes, I've already thought about Luke,

which is why
I'm only riding once a week.

01:41.423 --> 01:43.657
You think I'm being irresponsible.

01:44.659 --> 01:46.060
I can't believe that Kinney

01:46.061 --> 01:47.604
is making me take a picture every hour

in mind, right, Jackson?

04:28.190 --> 04:29.890

ultrasound to make sure.

Contrary to popular belief,

most soldiers didn't die
of battlefield wounds.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.564
It's the infection.

04:36.565 --> 04:38.588
Well, I'm not really sure
a horse bite constitutes,

04:38.589 --> 04:40.468
say, a battlefield wound.

Let's give us a thumbs up here, Todd.
