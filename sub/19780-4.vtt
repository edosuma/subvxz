WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:04.176
â™ª

00:04.177 --> 00:05.610
Excuse me.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.014
Charlie. Where's Alex?

00:09.015 --> 00:10.598
I want to get these announcements made.

00:10.599 --> 00:13.105
We're not exactly on the same
schedule these days, Dawn, and...

00:13.106 --> 00:14.720
nice bunnies.

00:14.721 --> 00:16.824
I don't think you're allowed
to comment on my bunnies

00:16.825 --> 00:18.256
now that we're not married.

00:18.307 --> 00:19.474
Hey, there she is.

00:19.475 --> 00:22.944
At least, I think that's her.

00:22.945 --> 00:25.480
Oh, Pinky Tuscadero.

00:25.481 --> 00:27.215
Sorry. Sorry, I'm late.

00:27.216 --> 00:30.818
I was just... Had a little
problem with the kickstand.

00:30.819 --> 00:32.453
Remind me not to park near you.

00:32.454 --> 00:34.589
Okay, everybody, listen up.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.691
As you know, our new C.E.O.,
Thomas Leffering,

00:36.692 --> 00:38.059
will be joining us today,

00:38.060 --> 00:41.162
and I need everybody
to be on best behavior.

00:41.163 --> 00:42.897
So I see you went for the bike.

00:42.898 --> 00:44.132
Dawn: Mr. Leffering will be...

00:44.133 --> 00:45.733
Yeah, I thought it was time.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.802
I've always wanted one. You knew that.

00:47.803 --> 00:49.637
I'm not sure what I know anymore.

00:49.638 --> 00:52.006
- Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm being safe.
- Yeah.

00:52.007 --> 00:54.442
So was the kid who I pieced
back together two weeks ago.

00:54.443 --> 00:56.110
I want to show him that Hope Zion...

00:56.111 --> 00:57.345
I'm just... I'm making sure

00:57.346 --> 00:59.180
that you've thought this through.

00:59.181 --> 01:00.648
Completely.

01:00.649 --> 01:03.084
Speaking of new staff,
I would like to introduce

01:03.085 --> 01:04.919
our new junior resident, Billy Scott,

01:04.920 --> 01:07.488
who is fresh from his surgical
internship at St. Vic's.

01:07.489 --> 01:08.823
- Welcome, Billy.
- Oh!

01:08.824 --> 01:10.925
- [Applause]
- Oh, wunderbar, wunderbar.

01:10.926 --> 01:13.161
Tell me they didn't hire Billy.

01:13.162 --> 01:15.596
Maybe he's changed since med school.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.460
Dawn: Before I tell you
to go forth and doctor,

01:17.461 --> 01:19.867
does anybody have any questions?

01:19.868 --> 01:23.169
That are not about why I
am dressed like this?

01:24.272 --> 01:26.440
I didn't think so. As you were.

01:26.441 --> 01:28.008
Make it a great day, everyone.

01:30.344 --> 01:32.513
Mm.

01:32.514 --> 01:35.149
Alex Reid, you bad, bad girl.

01:35.150 --> 01:37.351
Oh, well, you know what?
Before you say anything,

01:37.352 --> 01:38.855
yes, I've already thought about Luke,

01:38.856 --> 01:41.422
which is why
I'm only riding once a week.

01:41.423 --> 01:43.657
You think I'm being irresponsible.

01:44.659 --> 01:46.060
I can't believe that Kinney

01:46.061 --> 01:47.604
is making me take a picture every hour

01:47.605 --> 01:49.103
to prove I'm not cheating on our bet.

01:49.104 --> 01:51.199
- [Camera shutter clicks]
- So cute.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.534
Please tell me you're gonna
bring those bunny ears home.

01:53.535 --> 01:55.770
Mm. [Smooches]

01:55.771 --> 01:57.538
Can you grab my book? We got to go.

01:57.539 --> 01:59.574
I got to get a chapter in before lunch.

01:59.575 --> 02:01.309
How is that Tolstoy, who's dead,

02:01.310 --> 02:03.044
is getting more action than me?

02:03.045 --> 02:04.708
Have I told you how
much I hate book club?

02:04.709 --> 02:06.981
You're just jealous because
I have hobbies and you don't.

02:06.982 --> 02:08.515
Are you calling me a jerk, Bell?

02:08.517 --> 02:09.817
No.

02:09.818 --> 02:11.652
I'm calling you an angry loner, Miller.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.921
Oh. Now you're just projecting.

02:13.922 --> 02:17.425
[Smooches]

02:17.426 --> 02:19.627
Mm. Oh, I almost forgot.

02:19.628 --> 02:22.171
Have you thought any more about
that thing that we talked about?

02:22.172 --> 02:23.197
By "that thing,"

02:23.198 --> 02:25.833
do you mean asking your
ex-husband out on a man date?

02:25.834 --> 02:27.768
Charlie needs to open up.

02:27.769 --> 02:29.704
You guys are like two
angry loners in a pod.

02:29.705 --> 02:30.837
Dawn.

02:32.607 --> 02:34.842
Zach, please.

02:34.843 --> 02:38.279
Has anyone seen Charlie Harris?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.347
[Groans]

02:43.217 --> 02:44.919
Harris, buddy, good to see you.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.287
Arm still bugging you?

02:46.288 --> 02:48.456
No. I just... I twisted it
this morning playing squash.

02:48.457 --> 02:49.457
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.524
Where do you play?

02:50.525 --> 02:52.008
I was on my way to a consult, Zach.

02:52.009 --> 02:52.913
Do you want something?

02:52.914 --> 02:54.354
No, I just wanted to see
how the best orthopod

02:54.355 --> 02:55.896
- in the city was doing.
- Okay.

02:55.897 --> 02:57.298
Dawn put you up to this.

02:57.299 --> 02:58.642
It was the bunny ears, wasn't it?

02:58.643 --> 03:01.369
Look, just humor me
so I'm not a liar, okay?

03:01.370 --> 03:02.703
Okay.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.605
- How you doing?
- Good.

03:04.606 --> 03:06.040
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.576
Want to go for a beer sometime?

03:08.577 --> 03:10.945
I'll let you know.

03:10.946 --> 03:13.281
- Cool.
- Cool.

03:13.282 --> 03:15.016
Woman on P.A.: Medicine, 4-8.

03:15.017 --> 03:17.285
Hey, looks like we're
working together today.

03:17.286 --> 03:19.720
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.022
- After you.
- No, you go ahead.

03:21.023 --> 03:22.886
- No, no, no. No, no.
- Honestly, I don't mind.

03:22.887 --> 03:25.054
- Ladies first.
- How about I go?

03:29.096 --> 03:30.730
Go.

03:33.301 --> 03:34.869
Dr. Reid, Dr. Harris.

03:34.870 --> 03:37.138
Todd Groaner, 42.
Open forearm fracture.

03:37.139 --> 03:38.973
Also has some abdominal discomfort.

03:38.974 --> 03:40.608
[British accent] Billingsley platoon.

03:40.609 --> 03:42.410
Hit us up
behind the fourth Light Brigade.

03:42.411 --> 03:44.679
Damn horse got spooked.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.147
Translation, Jackson.

03:46.148 --> 03:47.949
- He's part of a war re-enactment group.
- Ah.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.013
His horse threw him off,
took a bite of his forearm.

03:50.014 --> 03:52.820
I already gave him
a tetanus shot for it.

03:52.821 --> 03:54.955
[Normal voice] I play Icarus Baltimore,

03:54.956 --> 03:57.024
British general, War of 1812.

03:57.025 --> 04:00.528
The horse's teeth went
straight through my plain coat.

04:00.529 --> 04:01.810
Oh, I hate it when that happens.

04:01.811 --> 04:03.234
Let's have a quick look here, Todd.

04:03.235 --> 04:04.465
[Groans] Oh.

04:04.466 --> 04:07.268
- Okay, I'm gonna check your
belly for bruising. - Oh.

04:07.269 --> 04:11.272
I just need to lift up
your shirt, all right?

04:11.273 --> 04:14.709
Oh, that is a nasty bruise.
All right, here we go.

04:14.710 --> 04:15.810
[Grunts]

04:15.811 --> 04:16.810
[Screams]

04:16.812 --> 04:17.812
Jackson, can I get

04:17.813 --> 04:18.813
some morphine, please?

04:18.814 --> 04:19.814
It'll take the edge off.

04:19.815 --> 04:21.214
Okay, but not too much.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.784
I have a sensitive tummy.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.153
I-I swear... It's like Diarrhea
City, and I'm the mayor.

04:26.154 --> 04:28.189
Whoa-Kay, let's keep that
in mind, right, Jackson?

04:28.190 --> 04:29.890
Looks like it's just bruising,

04:29.891 --> 04:31.726
but let's do an
ultrasound to make sure.

04:31.727 --> 04:33.494
Contrary to popular belief,

04:33.495 --> 04:35.358
most soldiers didn't die
of battlefield wounds.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.564
It's the infection.

04:36.565 --> 04:38.588
Well, I'm not really sure
a horse bite constitutes,

04:38.589 --> 04:40.468
say, a battlefield wound.

04:40.469 --> 04:42.203
Let's give us a thumbs up here, Todd.

04:42.204 --> 04:43.871
[Straining]

04:43.872 --> 04:47.174
And one of these.

04:47.175 --> 04:48.676
Okay, neurovascular looks good,

04:48.677 --> 04:50.578
so let's splint this and
get him into imaging.

04:50.579 --> 04:51.746
Uh, right after I run a FAST.

04:51.747 --> 04:53.210
I could grab that for you, Dr. Reid.

04:53.211 --> 04:55.978
- No, I'll... I'll grab that.
- No, I'll get it.

04:58.586 --> 04:59.720
[Sighs]

04:59.721 --> 05:01.956
Seven years of school to
tell yet another person

05:01.957 --> 05:04.225
that their burst
appendix is actually gas.

05:04.226 --> 05:06.759
Just fart, people!

05:08.095 --> 05:11.331
Dev? Fart joke? No?

05:13.534 --> 05:15.770
[Sighs] Come on.

05:15.771 --> 05:17.705
Don't you think you're
being over-dramatic?

05:17.706 --> 05:19.440
Let it go. It's been a million years.

05:19.441 --> 05:21.475
After what he did, no.

05:21.476 --> 05:24.511
Once an ass, always an ass,
and Billy's an ass.

05:25.846 --> 05:26.981
See?

05:26.982 --> 05:28.883
Dev, perfect. Do me a favor.

05:28.884 --> 05:30.651
I want you to follow Billy around,

05:30.652 --> 05:31.919
everything he says and does.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.387
Just feel him out for me, would you?

05:33.388 --> 05:34.522
Are you serious?

05:34.523 --> 05:36.724
[Sarcastically] No, I'm kidding.

05:36.725 --> 05:39.226
In fact, what I want you to do
is just relax, put your feet up,

05:39.227 --> 05:40.610
maybe take a nap in the call room.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.363
Yes, I'm serious. Go.

05:42.364 --> 05:43.831
What's his problem?

05:43.832 --> 05:45.766
Oh, it's your new lackey, Billy.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.301
I thought Dev liked everybody.

05:47.302 --> 05:48.965
It's kind of why I like
making fun of him.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.037
Well, it's old baggage.

05:50.038 --> 05:51.539
Dev doesn't want him coming in here

05:51.540 --> 05:53.963
and messing up all the hard work
he's done to find his niche.

05:53.964 --> 05:56.043
- Zach, why isn't this thing charged?
- His niche?

05:56.044 --> 05:58.348
He hasn't been here long
enough to have a niche, unless...

05:58.349 --> 06:00.481
Oh, of course.
You mean stringing him along.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.583
Wow.

06:02.584 --> 06:04.118
You're kind of a jerk.

06:04.119 --> 06:05.886
Nope. Angry loner.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.222
There's a big difference.
Ask Dawn Bell.

06:08.223 --> 06:10.623
What? There is.

06:12.293 --> 06:14.728
Hey, oh! We have a leg, huh?

06:14.729 --> 06:17.298
Dr. Scott? Can I talk to you?

06:17.299 --> 06:20.067
Excuse us a moment.

06:20.068 --> 06:21.769
Man, you saved my ass.

06:21.770 --> 06:23.637
I don't know how to make
anything out of these.

06:23.638 --> 06:26.340
Except the old chicken toupee.

06:26.341 --> 06:27.341
[Clucking]

06:27.342 --> 06:28.676
How you settling in, Billy?

06:28.677 --> 06:30.878
Excelente.
There's a nice atmosphere here.

06:30.879 --> 06:32.847
It's very firm.

06:32.848 --> 06:34.014
I mean warm.

06:34.015 --> 06:35.583
I just wanted to let you know

06:35.584 --> 06:37.284
that I've been assigned
to show you around,

06:37.285 --> 06:40.454
and, uh, what happened between us,

06:40.455 --> 06:42.223
it's water under the bridge.

06:42.224 --> 06:43.491
Sorry?

06:43.492 --> 06:46.227
You know... that time you
cheated off me in finals

06:46.228 --> 06:47.611
and almost got us both kicked out.

06:47.612 --> 06:49.830
Right, yeah, that thing.

06:49.831 --> 06:51.254
- [Siren wailing in distance]
- Hmm.

06:51.255 --> 06:53.968
Well, thanks for being so cool,

06:53.969 --> 06:57.438
but it's kind of weird
you brought it up...

06:57.439 --> 06:58.672
bro.

06:58.673 --> 07:00.908
Archie, Jughead, incoming.
We got a John Doe.

07:00.909 --> 07:02.643
He's in rough shape.
I need your "A" game.

07:02.644 --> 07:04.144
[Radio chatter]

07:04.145 --> 07:05.546
Here we go.

07:05.547 --> 07:07.450
Andrea, we need saline
bags and warming blankets

07:07.451 --> 07:10.050
as fast as you can get them, please.

07:10.051 --> 07:11.285
What the hell happened to him?

07:11.286 --> 07:13.020
Exactly what it looks like.

07:13.021 --> 07:15.956
He's frozen.

07:15.957 --> 07:21.253
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

07:23.594 --> 07:25.906
City workers found him
in a refrigeration unit

07:25.907 --> 07:27.523
at an abandoned warehouse in Tecumseh.

07:27.524 --> 07:29.024
What was he doing there?

07:29.025 --> 07:31.159
You want to ask him, or shall I?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.960
Come on, Dev. Let's get
some more blankets on him.

07:32.961 --> 07:33.529
Yeah, I'm here.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.633
His heart may have stopped,
his body might be frozen,

07:35.634 --> 07:36.833
but he is not dead.

07:39.635 --> 07:41.770
Someone page cardiac surgery

07:41.771 --> 07:43.314
and see if they got an ECMO available.

07:43.315 --> 07:44.773
No light reactivity. Dilated pupils.

07:44.774 --> 07:45.874
Want to run more saline?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.178
Are you asking me or telling me?

07:47.179 --> 07:48.844
Telling you. Attaboy.

07:48.845 --> 07:50.628
Let's go, Cassie.
Let's get that tube in him.

07:50.629 --> 07:52.414
Okay. Hold compressions.

07:52.415 --> 07:53.547
Okay.

07:55.284 --> 07:57.185
Yep.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.320
Where's my temperature?

07:58.321 --> 07:59.555
Coming in.

07:59.556 --> 08:03.158
Normal is 37 degrees Centigrade.

08:03.159 --> 08:05.827
- Let's see.
- [Monitor beeping]

08:05.828 --> 08:07.029
No, he's 0.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.791
- This dude's cryogenic.
- It doesn't matter.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.735
We don't know if he's alive
until we warm him up.

08:10.736 --> 08:13.209
Come on, get more on there.

08:14.002 --> 08:15.904
[Monitor beeping]

08:15.905 --> 08:18.372
Temperature's rising.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.941
[Monitor beeping]

08:24.680 --> 08:25.480
1.

08:25.481 --> 08:26.648
Okay, we are making progress.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.783
Let's keep working here.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.655
â™ª

08:33.655 --> 08:34.355
Oh! Hey.

08:34.356 --> 08:36.357
You trying to get
closer to me, Dr. Reid?

08:36.359 --> 08:38.994
- [Chuckles]
- Hey, what's with the field bag?

08:38.995 --> 08:40.462
I'd love to stay and chat,

08:40.462 --> 08:42.331
but I got a patient in
the Cath Lab I got to...

08:42.332 --> 08:43.899
Dr. Palmer. What are you doing here?

08:43.900 --> 08:46.101
You're not on the board today.

08:46.102 --> 08:49.236
[Whispering] I can explain.

08:52.174 --> 08:54.376
You can explain why
you're taking equipment out

08:54.377 --> 08:55.711
when you're off shift?

08:55.712 --> 08:56.912
I look forward to it.

08:56.913 --> 08:59.014
One sec.

08:59.015 --> 09:01.883
Mia Reynolds.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.719
Sweet kid.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.063
She was part of my youth group
that I run out of my church.

09:06.064 --> 09:08.390
She fell off the grid about a
month ago when she left home.

09:08.391 --> 09:09.958
What happened to her?

09:09.959 --> 09:11.994
That's what I'm trying
to figure out right now.

09:11.995 --> 09:14.338
She texted me out of the blue,
saying that she needed help.

09:14.339 --> 09:16.565
Said some kids beat her up
that she owed money to.

09:16.566 --> 09:18.300
So, why isn't she coming here?

09:18.301 --> 09:21.870
She doesn't want her folks
to find out where she is, so...

09:21.871 --> 09:23.174
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

09:23.175 --> 09:24.840
- They must be worried sick.
- Yeah.

09:24.841 --> 09:26.842
Look, I'm just gonna go find her

09:26.843 --> 09:29.144
so I can figure out why she
ran away in the first place.

09:29.145 --> 09:31.313
Um, I mean, you're welcome to join,

09:31.314 --> 09:33.281
but you're on shift, right?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.317
I'll figure it out.

09:35.318 --> 09:37.085
Yeah? [Laughs]

09:37.086 --> 09:38.654
Ditching work? That's not your brand.

09:38.655 --> 09:40.622
Maybe my brand is changing.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.324
You got to live a little, right?

09:42.325 --> 09:44.559
Look, I have a ton of
mental-health days saved up.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.560
Let me give you a hand.

09:45.561 --> 09:47.663
Okay.

09:47.664 --> 09:50.030
- Meet in 10?
- Sure.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.201
[Chuckles]

09:56.138 --> 09:58.407
[Camera shutter clicks]

09:58.408 --> 10:00.289
People think that I don't
have a sense of humor.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.753
How long you gonna keep this up for?

10:01.754 --> 10:03.145
Oh. As long as I have to.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.812
I always make good on a bet.

10:07.182 --> 10:08.784
Can you point me
to Chief Bell's office?

10:08.785 --> 10:10.018
I have an appointment.

10:10.019 --> 10:12.387
You must be Thomas Leffering,
the new C.E.O.

10:12.388 --> 10:13.689
You're early.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.358
Yeah, I heard Bell was a bit
of a shrew about punctuality.

10:16.359 --> 10:18.326
A shrew?

10:18.327 --> 10:20.862
Oh, is she a friend of yours?
It's just a figure of speech.

10:20.863 --> 10:22.397
I don't mean any disrespect.

10:22.398 --> 10:25.801
No, why would I be offended
at you calling her a shrew?

10:25.802 --> 10:28.370
Unless, of course, I was her.

10:28.371 --> 10:31.306
Which I am.

10:31.307 --> 10:33.041
- You're Chief Bell?
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.743
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

10:34.744 --> 10:35.847
I thought you were a nurse.

10:35.848 --> 10:37.279
Ah, I got that.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.016
And truth be told, shrews
are actually kind of amazing.

10:41.017 --> 10:42.284
They have an excellent
sense of hearing.

10:42.285 --> 10:43.785
They procreate almost continuously,

10:43.786 --> 10:46.289
- which is nice for them.
- Dr. Bell, you're needed in the E.R.

10:46.290 --> 10:48.523
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- I'll join you.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.959
Shall we hop to it?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.627
Sure.

10:55.297 --> 10:56.998
It'll be so awkward.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.401
How is working with Charlie
more awkward for you right now?

10:59.402 --> 11:01.426
'Cause I don't want to
be caught in the middle.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.070
[Sighs]

11:02.071 --> 11:03.454
Plus, I have this ton of paperwork

11:03.455 --> 11:04.973
to do for a cancer trial.

11:04.974 --> 11:05.802
Remember our trial?

11:05.803 --> 11:07.642
Yeah, guess who already
finished her half.

11:07.643 --> 11:09.586
Which means that I'll have
time to do yours, too,

11:09.587 --> 11:11.680
- if you do this for me.
- Hmm.

11:11.681 --> 11:14.916
Look, okay. [Breathes deeply]

11:14.917 --> 11:17.238
Have you ever felt like you
woke up in someone else's body,

11:17.239 --> 11:18.342
living someone else's life?

11:18.343 --> 11:19.254
Yes.

11:19.255 --> 11:20.522
It's called having a moment,

11:20.523 --> 11:22.557
and it's completely normal
after a major breakup.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.426
So that's a yes?

11:24.427 --> 11:26.294
Tag me in.

11:26.295 --> 11:27.838
Great. Patient's name is Todd Groaner.

11:27.839 --> 11:29.064
He fell off his horse.

11:29.065 --> 11:30.799
There's no internal bleeding,
but his abdomen is swollen,

11:30.800 --> 11:32.234
so check in on him periodically,

11:32.235 --> 11:34.102
make sure the swelling
has gone down. Bye.

11:34.103 --> 11:36.505
Do I need to worry about you?

11:36.506 --> 11:39.007
Maggie, there you are.

11:39.008 --> 11:41.343
I would like to introduce
you to Thomas Leffering,

11:41.344 --> 11:42.410
our new C.E.O.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.446
Nice to meet young... you.

11:44.447 --> 11:45.947
Likewise.

11:45.948 --> 11:48.416
I was just telling Thomas
about your cancer trial.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.920
Chief Bell wanted to make sure I knew

11:49.921 --> 11:51.504
how seriously you all take your work...

11:51.505 --> 11:52.420
rabbit ears and all.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.855
Huh. He saw you in your...

11:53.856 --> 11:55.157
Never mind.

11:55.158 --> 11:57.926
Can you send Alex our way
when she finishes with Charlie?

11:57.927 --> 12:00.195
No, I ca... Uh, what? What?

12:00.196 --> 12:01.296
Pardon?

12:01.297 --> 12:04.633
Alex is, uh, sick.

12:04.634 --> 12:06.201
I saw her this morning.

12:06.202 --> 12:08.203
Uh, mental-health day.

12:08.204 --> 12:10.472
Sorry. I got to go. Got to take this.

12:10.473 --> 12:13.107
I'm guessing she didn't
clear that with you.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:33.361 --> 12:35.931
Sure this is really the place?

12:35.932 --> 12:37.665
According to her text.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.402
Okay, these kids meant business.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.474
Just hang back, okay?

12:46.475 --> 12:48.577
Might have company.

12:48.578 --> 12:52.247
I've pulled my brother out
of way worse places than this.

12:52.248 --> 12:54.449
I can handle myself, thanks.

12:54.450 --> 12:57.352
That's blood.

12:57.353 --> 12:58.585
Mia?!

13:01.756 --> 13:03.525
- Mia?
- Oh, God.

13:03.526 --> 13:06.328
- Mia!
- [Breathing heavily]

13:06.329 --> 13:08.363
Sweetie, why didn't you
tell me it was this bad?

13:08.364 --> 13:09.798
I didn't want you to call my mom.

13:09.799 --> 13:12.534
Honey, we need to see where the
blood's coming from, all right?

13:12.535 --> 13:14.903
Okay. We need to get her
to Hope-Zee right now.

13:14.904 --> 13:15.971
I'm calling an ambulance.

13:15.972 --> 13:17.672
Can't you just take care of me here?

13:17.673 --> 13:19.206
I'm sorry. We can't.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.411
Hi. This is Dr. Alex Reid.

13:23.412 --> 13:26.014
I'm with a 16-year-old girl.
Stab wound to the lower abdomen.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.183
I need an ambulance to
1551 Ossington right away.

13:28.184 --> 13:29.317
Back alley.

13:29.318 --> 13:30.852
Hey, honey.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.636
We're gonna take good
care of you, all right?

13:32.637 --> 13:34.083
Okay.

13:39.396 --> 13:40.529
[Monitor beeping]

13:41.002 --> 13:42.736
Alex, you look different.

13:42.737 --> 13:45.105
She's taking a mental-health day.

13:45.106 --> 13:47.808
I see. Get Dr. Lin a scalpel, please.

13:47.809 --> 13:50.177
I'm just debriding Todd's wound.

13:50.178 --> 13:51.918
The fascia doesn't look
too bad from here.

13:54.014 --> 13:56.850
- Alex okay?
- How's the new place?

13:56.851 --> 14:01.488
The cleaning staff at the hotel
is very friendly, thank you.

14:01.489 --> 14:02.990
How's the study going?

14:02.991 --> 14:05.659
Well, Alex just volunteered
to do all the paperwork,

14:05.660 --> 14:07.661
so yay me.

14:07.662 --> 14:10.364
I'd be wary of that.
Alex hates paperwork.

14:10.365 --> 14:12.199
My experience... She only does it

14:12.200 --> 14:13.343
because she wants to get out

14:13.344 --> 14:15.669
of doing something she really hates.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.338
- [Clears throat]
- Wait a second.

14:17.339 --> 14:20.607
Okay. How about we
don't talk about Alex?

14:20.608 --> 14:21.871
I don't mean to be insensitive,

14:21.872 --> 14:23.877
but I'm her best friend, and...

14:23.878 --> 14:25.479
And I'm not. Yeah, no, I got that.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.947
Thank you.

14:26.948 --> 14:28.349
[Groans]

14:28.350 --> 14:29.983
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:29.984 --> 14:31.552
[Breathes deeply]

14:31.553 --> 14:33.087
Yep.

14:33.088 --> 14:35.089
If you ask me...

14:35.090 --> 14:37.490
I'm not the one everyone
needs to worry about.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.199
Mia, your external
stab wound was minor,

14:45.200 --> 14:47.263
but it's a good thing that
we found you when we did.

14:47.264 --> 14:49.970
Dr. Palmer found an
intra-abdominal bleed.

14:49.971 --> 14:51.538
Are you gonna call the cops?

14:51.539 --> 14:53.640
You suffered a serious injury.

14:53.641 --> 14:55.776
What Dr. Reid means is
that we have to report it.

14:55.777 --> 14:57.745
But they'll call my mom,

14:57.746 --> 14:59.947
and you promised me
if I told you where I was,

14:59.948 --> 15:01.531
- you wouldn't call her.
- Okay, listen.

15:01.532 --> 15:03.150
Nobody's gonna call anyone, all right?

15:03.151 --> 15:04.785
Just take a deep breath.

15:04.786 --> 15:06.987
Mia, listen, I think it is time

15:06.988 --> 15:08.731
that we talked to someone
in Child Services.

15:08.732 --> 15:11.425
They've already put me in a
home with a different family.

15:11.426 --> 15:13.026
And you didn't like them?

15:13.027 --> 15:14.061
They were great.

15:14.062 --> 15:16.296
Everyone was real nice...

15:16.297 --> 15:18.798
especially the dad.

15:20.033 --> 15:22.403
They sent me back to my mom, anyway.

15:22.404 --> 15:24.671
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

15:24.672 --> 15:27.674
Then please don't tell anyone.

15:27.675 --> 15:30.610
I just want to take care of myself.

15:36.450 --> 15:38.986
[Panting]

15:38.987 --> 15:41.688
That's 30 degrees.
Let's just call it, already.

15:41.689 --> 15:44.158
Time of death... 11:36 a.m.

15:44.159 --> 15:46.102
What are you doing?
We're waiting for Dr. Miller.

15:46.103 --> 15:47.861
Oh, come on, dude. This guy's toast.

15:47.862 --> 15:49.029
Freezer-burnt toast.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.031
Who's toast?

15:51.032 --> 15:53.000
Is this...

15:53.001 --> 15:55.602
I've never actually seen
a dead body before.

15:55.603 --> 15:58.505
What's going on here?
Did someone page Cardiology?

15:58.506 --> 16:00.273
Chief Bell, we tried your phone.

16:02.109 --> 16:03.444
Resume CPR.

16:03.445 --> 16:05.946
Dr. Scott, did I just
hear you pronounce him?

16:05.947 --> 16:08.215
Well... not officially.

16:08.216 --> 16:10.159
Dr. Sekara, what were his
vitals when he came in?

16:10.160 --> 16:12.653
None present. Temperature was 0.

16:12.654 --> 16:14.288
Somebody get me an ECMO... now!

16:14.289 --> 16:15.722
Right here.

16:15.723 --> 16:17.624
Dawn Bell. Just the person
we were looking for.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.088
Cassie: I got his test results back.

16:19.089 --> 16:20.601
Iceman's potassium levels are normal.

16:20.602 --> 16:22.296
Potassium is vital
for the communication

16:22.297 --> 16:23.720
between the nerves and the muscles.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.665
Because it's normal,

16:24.666 --> 16:26.627
we actually have a chance
of restarting his heart.

16:26.628 --> 16:28.262
So why was he headed to the morgue?

16:28.263 --> 16:30.103
He wasn't. I was just joking around.

16:30.104 --> 16:31.905
About pronouncing a living man dead?

16:31.906 --> 16:33.507
I assure you that our residents

16:33.508 --> 16:35.442
were doing the best
job that they could.

16:35.443 --> 16:37.144
Dr. Miller,
who did you leave in charge?

16:37.145 --> 16:38.578
Dr. Sekara, ma'am.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.814
I believe she was talking to me.

16:43.183 --> 16:45.318
Sekara.

16:48.522 --> 16:50.723
â™ª

16:59.500 --> 17:02.101
[Fife playing]

17:08.208 --> 17:10.344
Oh, Todd?

17:10.345 --> 17:12.012
Your body's supposed to be in recovery,

17:12.012 --> 17:13.881
so what are you doing here?

17:13.882 --> 17:17.384
[British accent]
My name is Icarus Baltimore III.

17:17.385 --> 17:20.319
Brave general of the 1812 War.

17:26.093 --> 17:28.529
- [Elevator bell dings]
- Mercy to the Father!

17:28.530 --> 17:30.597
What angel of darkness
has come upon me?

17:30.598 --> 17:32.432
I'm sorry. Are you talking about me?

17:32.433 --> 17:35.601
Back, back, alien foe.

17:36.904 --> 17:39.106
Lest you feel the soft
kiss of my trusty blade.

17:39.107 --> 17:41.909
[Laughs] To the top, lads!

17:41.910 --> 17:43.043
[Elevator bell dings]

17:43.044 --> 17:45.979
Huzzah!

17:45.980 --> 17:50.551
Top floor is proctology.

17:50.552 --> 17:52.586
[Monitor beeping]

17:52.587 --> 17:53.954
How's our patient doing, Maggie?

17:53.955 --> 17:55.022
Not great.

17:55.023 --> 17:56.366
I gave him morphine for the pain,

17:56.367 --> 17:58.859
but since then, he's been
in and out of consciousness.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.443
Okay, let's get him
a round of cultures.

18:00.444 --> 18:02.396
Full panel... blood, sputum,
urine, the works.

18:02.397 --> 18:03.900
Anything specific you're looking for?

18:03.901 --> 18:04.965
Whatever we can find.

18:04.966 --> 18:06.867
Want to get him back
into fighting shape

18:06.868 --> 18:07.935
as soon as possible.

18:07.936 --> 18:10.170
Ah, yes. Icarus Baltimore.

18:10.171 --> 18:11.505
Jackson told me.

18:11.506 --> 18:13.640
Yeah. Grown-ups playing dress-up.

18:13.641 --> 18:14.942
It's why I don't like clubs.

18:14.943 --> 18:17.911
From what I read,
neither did Icarus Baltimore.

18:17.912 --> 18:19.980
What do you mean?

18:19.981 --> 18:22.716
Apparently, his platoon turned on him.

18:22.717 --> 18:23.984
Mutiny!

18:23.985 --> 18:26.820
But, also...

18:26.821 --> 18:28.854
who does that look like to you?

18:32.626 --> 18:35.027
â™ª

18:39.232 --> 18:41.234
[Sighs]

18:41.235 --> 18:43.837
I told you not to pronounce him,
Dr. Scott, and you know it.

18:43.838 --> 18:45.105
- No, technically, all you said...
- Mm.

18:45.106 --> 18:46.540
...is that you were
waiting for Dr. Miller.

18:46.541 --> 18:47.874
Don't do this to me, Billy.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.138
Beavis, Butthead, quit your bickering.
We're losing time.

18:50.139 --> 18:51.979
Care to explain what
happened here, Dr. Bell?

18:51.980 --> 18:53.280
It was a mistake.

18:53.281 --> 18:56.149
I appreciate your philosophy
is "no harm, no foul."

18:56.150 --> 18:58.493
Of course, you're not the one
waking up in a morgue drawer.

18:58.494 --> 19:01.455
Look, I take the behavior
of my residents very seriously.

19:01.456 --> 19:04.491
Now, if you will excuse me,
that man is not dying today.

19:04.492 --> 19:08.060
At least not for a second time, right?

19:18.192 --> 19:19.394
[Monitor beeping]

19:19.395 --> 19:21.529
Okay, we are on pump.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.873
What are we watching for, Sekara?

19:22.874 --> 19:24.499
Dev: Keeping an eye on the pressure.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.689
Who knew Big Brother
had such a baby face?

19:26.690 --> 19:28.224
Don't let it fool you.

19:28.225 --> 19:31.094
He's an MBA whiz kid with
connections up the wazoo.

19:31.095 --> 19:32.528
Remember St. Sylvester?

19:32.529 --> 19:34.664
I thought that got
swallowed up by the General.

19:34.665 --> 19:36.799
Yeah, and who do you
think was behind that?

19:36.800 --> 19:40.769
Patient's not exhibiting
any contractions.

19:42.338 --> 19:44.140
No spontaneous action in the heart.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.684
Are you sure his potassium was normal?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.343
100%.

19:47.344 --> 19:50.213
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

19:50.214 --> 19:53.616
We're getting electrical activity.

19:53.617 --> 19:55.885
Come on, you frozen bastard, live!

19:55.886 --> 19:57.954
Okay, he's got
ventricular fibrillation.

19:57.955 --> 19:59.722
Dr. Sekara, make sure
the pads are in place.

19:59.723 --> 20:01.357
[Paddles whine]

20:01.358 --> 20:02.458
- We're good to go.
- Okay.

20:02.459 --> 20:04.893
Three, two, one, clear.

20:06.362 --> 20:08.297
- [Paddles whine]
- Going again.

Three, two, one, clear.

20:12.802 --> 20:15.237
[Monitor beeping]

20:16.673 --> 20:20.909
Okay, give me 10 MICs magnesium,
22 calcium, and Lidocaine.

20:22.145 --> 20:24.814
[Paddles whine]

20:24.815 --> 20:27.482
Okay, three, two, one, clear.

20:29.819 --> 20:30.887
Do you want me to call it?

20:30.888 --> 20:32.989
We're going again.

20:32.990 --> 20:35.223
Three, two, one, clear.

20:39.229 --> 20:40.830
I say when we stop. You got that?

20:40.831 --> 20:41.963
Copy that.

20:43.199 --> 20:44.267
Let's go again.

20:44.268 --> 20:47.803
Three, two, one, clear.

20:51.507 --> 20:53.542

There it is. [Laughs]

21:25.007 --> 21:27.243
Hey. Got your text.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.377
What's wrong?

21:28.378 --> 21:31.314
It's Mia. She went hypotensive.

21:31.315 --> 21:32.615
- What?
- Yeah.

21:32.616 --> 21:34.851
I tried to stabilize her,
but she has a splenic bleed.

21:34.852 --> 21:37.120
And I tried to embolize
the artery, but...

21:37.121 --> 21:38.621
Look, we don't have much time.

21:38.622 --> 21:41.424
I have to open her up.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.292
What about her circumstances?

21:43.293 --> 21:45.361
She's a minor,
and in an emergency situation,

21:45.362 --> 21:47.597
I'm medically within
my right to do this.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.299
One step at a time.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.668
Okay.

21:52.669 --> 21:55.104
Okay, get him into the
ICU to assess digits.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.307
Page Neuro, and I want an EEG.
And monitor him regularly.

21:58.308 --> 22:00.376
- No problemo.
- You got it.

22:00.377 --> 22:02.011
What is with those two?

22:02.012 --> 22:03.880
Competing is kind of their thing.

22:03.881 --> 22:04.981
Their thing is annoying.

22:04.982 --> 22:06.149
[Chuckles] Yeah.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.784
Cassie, can you find
out who that guy is

22:07.785 --> 22:09.128
so that we can notify his family?

22:09.129 --> 22:10.553
On it. Oh. Sorry.

22:10.554 --> 22:12.088
Here, I'll go around. No?

22:12.089 --> 22:13.389
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Okay.

Nice meeting you. [Chuckles]

Just a taste of what we can do
when we have the right tools.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.171
Except, didn't I just overhear
you saying "page Neuro"?

22:28.172 --> 22:30.540
He's a risk for brain damage,
I presume?

22:30.541 --> 22:33.142
Anytime someone comes
in a hypothermic state,

22:33.143 --> 22:35.144
they require extra monitoring.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.946

You're right.

Where are my manners?

- Great work, Chief.

Aw. I got to take this.

22:44.288 --> 22:45.855
Yeah?

22:45.856 --> 22:48.124
Good. I got in this morning.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.892
No, I scheduled that for Thursday.

22:57.733 --> 22:59.468
Alex.

22:59.469 --> 23:02.071
I was informed that you had
taken a mental-health day.

23:02.072 --> 23:03.840
Dawn, hi. Can I talk
to you about this later?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.144
I meant to talk to you, but I...

23:05.145 --> 23:06.142
But you didn't, did you?

23:06.143 --> 23:08.076
Because you knew that I would say no.

23:10.046 --> 23:12.148
Look, Alex, I, of all people,

23:12.149 --> 23:14.030
get that you're having
a hard time with Charlie,

23:14.031 --> 23:15.698
but you can't let it affect your work.

23:15.699 --> 23:18.054
- It's not affecting my work.
- No?

23:18.055 --> 23:20.857
You knew that the C.E.O.
was coming today.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.158
How do you think it looks

23:22.159 --> 23:24.026
when I don't know
where my own staff is?

23:24.027 --> 23:26.095
Okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

23:26.096 --> 23:27.930
I have a 16-year-old
with a splenic bleed,

23:27.931 --> 23:31.234
and I need you to bump an
elective out of O.R. 1 for me.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.436
Like hell I will.

23:33.437 --> 23:36.606
You hand that surgery off,
or I will fire your ass.

23:36.607 --> 23:38.174
You're benched.

23:38.175 --> 23:39.375
You wanted the day off?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.643
You got it.

23:40.644 --> 23:41.677
You can't be serious.

23:41.678 --> 23:43.779
I am very serious.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.181
You made the rules.

23:45.182 --> 23:47.283
Live with it.

23:47.284 --> 23:50.018
[Cellphone buzzes]

23:53.556 --> 23:56.291
Then I'll follow my rules.

23:57.193 --> 24:00.228
â™ª

24:03.032 --> 24:04.634
[British accent] I have never seen

24:04.635 --> 24:06.869
quite such a lifelike diorama.

24:06.870 --> 24:11.607
Hey, Icarus, do you think
I could talk to Todd now?

24:11.608 --> 24:13.809
I haven't the foggiest idea
to whom you're referring.

24:13.810 --> 24:15.811
But who is this Todd you speak of?

24:15.812 --> 24:17.980
Okay, you're not Icarus Baltimore

24:17.981 --> 24:21.117
'cause he died like 200 years ago.

24:21.118 --> 24:25.153
I must find my platoon.

24:26.589 --> 24:27.757
Hey, why are you limping?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.592
Hey.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.292
Hey!

24:33.262 --> 24:35.831
Hello?! Your platoon is not here.

24:35.832 --> 24:39.168
And if it were, does the term
"mutiny" ring any bells?

24:39.169 --> 24:41.637
No, I'm serious, Todd.
What's up with your leg?

24:41.638 --> 24:43.339
I told you... I am not Todd.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.541
Okay, well, I guess that's good for you

24:45.542 --> 24:48.344
because Todd could really be sick.

24:48.345 --> 24:50.646
Well, how sick are we talking?

24:50.647 --> 24:54.283
You know, I'm not allowed
to share that information.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.684
Sort of doctor/patient privilege.

24:58.287 --> 25:00.256
The only person
I'm allowed to tell is Todd.

25:00.257 --> 25:03.058
Now, you wouldn't happen
to know where he is, would you?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.963
[Normal voice] Fine, fine. You got me.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.931
I don't get it.
What's... What's with the act?

25:11.634 --> 25:14.303
Todd Groaner, social weirdo.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.439
Always was. Always will be.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.873
[Chuckles]

25:17.874 --> 25:20.009
Why do you think I dress
up like other people, huh?

25:20.010 --> 25:23.279
It's because I want to escape this.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.680
From your limp?

25:24.681 --> 25:27.350
Tuk-tuk accident.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.651
I was a kid.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.954
My family vacationing in Laos.

25:31.955 --> 25:35.691
I totally smashed up my leg.

25:35.692 --> 25:37.727
Turns out being a gimp

25:37.728 --> 25:40.529
doesn't exactly broaden
your social horizons.

25:40.530 --> 25:43.099
You think you're a social
misfit because of your leg?

25:43.100 --> 25:44.333
Look, you don't get it.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.835
You probably have a hot wife

25:45.836 --> 25:49.038
and surrounded by a ton
of friends all the time.

25:49.039 --> 25:53.175
Oh. Oh, yes, yes, I'm surrounded.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.111
But believe me when I tell you...

25:55.112 --> 25:58.481
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

25:58.482 --> 26:00.716
Well, it is to me.

26:00.717 --> 26:03.052
It's the only thing I want.

26:03.053 --> 26:05.321
That's why I joined the
re-enactment society.

26:05.322 --> 26:08.924
You know... to find my tribe.

26:08.925 --> 26:11.660
Well, in my experience,

26:11.661 --> 26:16.165
it's usually the tribe that finds you.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.934
And that starts with letting them in...

26:18.935 --> 26:20.902
to the real you.

26:30.746 --> 26:32.648
â™ª

26:32.649 --> 26:34.817
Hey, Doc.

26:34.818 --> 26:38.054
I thought Dr. Jones had this
O.R. booked for an elective.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.855
She owed me a favor.

26:39.856 --> 26:41.290
It's a good thing, too,

26:41.291 --> 26:43.592
because Dawn wasn't exactly
in the mood to help me.

26:43.593 --> 26:45.928
Got it.

26:45.929 --> 26:47.196
So, where do you need me?

26:47.197 --> 26:48.864
I'm not cleared to operate,
so I need you

26:48.865 --> 26:51.133
to hold Dawn at bay after
we get Mia prepped.

26:51.134 --> 26:53.869
You... You sure
you're okay with all this?

26:53.870 --> 26:55.871
I mean, seriously...

26:55.872 --> 26:57.580
why are you going to
the wall for this kid?

26:57.581 --> 26:59.608
She's spent her whole life
looking after herself.

26:59.609 --> 27:01.310
I just... I think it's time

27:01.311 --> 27:03.678
that somebody stepped up
and looked after her.

27:12.435 --> 27:16.239
[Monitor beeping]

27:16.240 --> 27:19.208
So, I got your text.
It's bone infection?

27:19.209 --> 27:20.943
Osteomyelitis.

27:20.944 --> 27:23.679
I gave him large doses
of I.V. antibiotic,

27:23.680 --> 27:26.916
and the fracture just occurred,
so I don't get it.

27:26.917 --> 27:29.009
Oh, that's probably
'cause it has nothing

27:29.010 --> 27:30.343
to do with his fracture.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.745
What do you mean?

27:31.746 --> 27:34.180
It's funny.
When Todd came in this morning,

27:34.181 --> 27:37.617
he told me that most soldiers
in 1812 died from infection.

27:37.618 --> 27:40.654
That's how his alter ego,
Icarus Baltimore, died.

27:40.655 --> 27:44.391
I thought he was shot by his own men.

27:44.392 --> 27:47.527
Um, they shot him in the
right leg, left him to die,

27:47.528 --> 27:49.151
and it was the
infection that killed him.

27:49.152 --> 27:51.831
Huh.

27:51.832 --> 27:54.399
[Whistling]

27:55.602 --> 27:57.070
That's just freaky.

27:57.071 --> 27:58.405
Actually, it's not.

27:58.406 --> 28:00.740
He told me about an
earlier accident in Laos.

28:00.741 --> 28:02.008
Let's get him to imaging.

28:02.009 --> 28:04.210
Yes, Captain.

28:04.211 --> 28:06.246
[Monitor beeping]

28:06.247 --> 28:08.114
Okay, I can't see anything. Suction.

28:08.115 --> 28:09.516
Let's clear the field.

28:09.517 --> 28:11.718
I may need a clamp
to control the bleed.

28:11.719 --> 28:13.620
The tear in the splenic capsule

28:13.621 --> 28:14.964
is much worse than I anticipated.

28:14.965 --> 28:16.398
0 Vicryl.

28:22.028 --> 28:23.897
Roxy, talk to me. How's she doing?

28:23.898 --> 28:26.399
Not so hot, Dr. Reid.
She's lost a lot of blood.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.863
Okay, keep it coming with the O neg,

28:27.864 --> 28:30.036
and give me as much volume as possible.

28:30.037 --> 28:31.900
We're very excited about
the new surgical robot

28:31.901 --> 28:33.006
that we got from St. Vic's,

28:33.007 --> 28:35.311
and you'll be happy to know
that I got it at a good price.

28:35.312 --> 28:37.544
I'm curious to know your
definition of a good price.

28:37.545 --> 28:38.611
Emmanuel: Dr. Bell.

28:38.612 --> 28:40.980
Hey, where are you headed?

28:40.981 --> 28:43.349
Dr. Palmer,
have you met Thomas Leffering,

28:43.350 --> 28:44.884
our new C.E.O.?

28:44.885 --> 28:46.386
Oh. Good grip. [Chuckles]

28:46.387 --> 28:48.421
- Yeah, I should have been a surgeon.
- [Chuckles]

28:48.422 --> 28:51.257
I was just taking Thomas into the O.R.

28:51.258 --> 28:52.481
to look in on another surgery.

28:52.482 --> 28:53.460
I will get you later.

28:53.461 --> 28:55.124
Emmanuel: Dr. Bell,
that's not gonna work.

28:55.125 --> 28:57.197
Why not?

28:57.198 --> 28:59.733
Dr. Palmer, are you feeling okay?

28:59.734 --> 29:01.000
[Breathing heavily]

29:01.001 --> 29:02.702
Dr. Palmer?

29:02.703 --> 29:04.246
I think he's having trouble breathing.

29:04.247 --> 29:05.470
Oh, hey, I got you. I got you.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.664
â™ª

29:09.442 --> 29:11.644
Damn it. The capsule
isn't holding the sutures.

29:11.645 --> 29:13.213
All it's doing is making it bleed more.

29:13.214 --> 29:14.247
This thing's a mess.

29:14.248 --> 29:15.908
Let's pack off the rest of the abdomen.

29:17.884 --> 29:19.652
Okay, I'm not gonna be able to save it.

29:19.653 --> 29:21.116
I'm gonna have to remove the spleen.

29:21.117 --> 29:22.355
I can keep her stable

29:22.356 --> 29:23.939
while you go out and
talk to the family.

29:23.940 --> 29:26.926
That's fine, Roxy.
I don't need to talk to anyone.

29:26.927 --> 29:29.829
Do you have a problem
with that, Dr. O'Toole?

29:29.830 --> 29:33.233
No. I just wanted to say
I've got your back.

29:33.234 --> 29:35.801
Thank you.

29:38.304 --> 29:40.140
â™ª

29:40.141 --> 29:42.675
Well, I'll be. You were right.

29:42.676 --> 29:44.577
Yep. Let's book an O.R., Maggie.

29:44.578 --> 29:45.711
Okay.

29:47.013 --> 29:48.181
Wait.

29:48.182 --> 29:50.784
You honestly don't think
that it's a little eerie

29:50.785 --> 29:53.186
that it was the same leg
Icarus was shot in?

29:53.187 --> 29:55.655
You mean, do I believe
in reincarnation?

29:55.656 --> 29:57.524
No.

29:57.525 --> 30:00.360
You honestly think there's
no more to life than this?

30:00.361 --> 30:01.561
Yeah, of course, I do,

30:01.562 --> 30:04.164
'cause this place
is filled with ghosts.

30:04.165 --> 30:05.498
There's one.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.368
One down there. One right there.

30:08.369 --> 30:10.472
- Okay, thank you for your sarcasm.
- You're welcome.

30:10.473 --> 30:13.039
Hey, you ever ride in a tuk-tuk?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.041
No.

30:15.042 --> 30:16.843
That's a fun word, that.

30:16.844 --> 30:20.746
Tuk-tuk. Tuk-tuk.

30:22.215 --> 30:24.284
Blood pressure is good.
Breathing is better.

30:24.285 --> 30:26.485
Let's have a listen.

30:30.390 --> 30:34.160
Sinus rhythm is good.

30:34.161 --> 30:35.328
Mm.

30:35.329 --> 30:37.096
It could have been a panic attack.

30:37.097 --> 30:39.020
You really don't seem
like the anxious type.

30:39.021 --> 30:41.644
Chief, this conversation is sending
it through the roof, trust me.

30:41.645 --> 30:45.346
You hear that, Chief? You're scary.

30:46.039 --> 30:48.942
You know, I'm probably
not getting enough sleep.

30:48.943 --> 30:50.276
I think that's it.

30:50.277 --> 30:53.847
You know, anyway, look, I'm
sorry to have wasted your time,

30:53.848 --> 30:56.615
but I think I'm fine now, so...

31:05.525 --> 31:07.759
Can you just excuse me for a minute?

31:10.530 --> 31:12.498
Dr. Bell, come on, you've done enough.

31:12.499 --> 31:15.401
Oh, I know. I just wanted
to give you your award.

31:15.402 --> 31:16.970
- My award?
- Mm-hmm.

31:16.971 --> 31:19.305
Best actor in a
phony-baloney performance.

31:19.306 --> 31:20.707
[Laughs]

31:20.708 --> 31:22.141
Well, this is unexpected.

31:22.142 --> 31:23.405
I have so many people to thank.

31:23.406 --> 31:24.410
Uh...

31:24.411 --> 31:25.594
Start with my mom, of course.

31:25.595 --> 31:27.080
Dr. Palmer.

31:27.081 --> 31:29.115
- Yeah?
- Cut the charade.

31:29.116 --> 31:31.450
Tell me what the hell is going on.

31:33.453 --> 31:36.121
Stapler with a vascular load.

31:38.024 --> 31:39.692
Stapling the splenic hilum now.

31:39.693 --> 31:40.860
[Stapler clicks]

31:40.861 --> 31:42.462
[Sighs] Damn it! Sponges.

31:42.463 --> 31:43.763
- [Monitor beeping rapidly]
- That's not good.

31:43.764 --> 31:45.987
No, the stapler misfired.
Does nothing work around here?

31:45.988 --> 31:46.966
More sponges.

31:46.967 --> 31:48.768
She's in free fall. She's tachy.

31:48.769 --> 31:49.969
Push more volume.

31:49.970 --> 31:51.593
We've lost control
of the splenic artery.

31:51.594 --> 31:52.572
And where's my clamp?

31:52.573 --> 31:54.476
Pushing volume.
I wouldn't mess around too long.

31:54.477 --> 31:55.308
She's hypovolemic.

31:55.309 --> 31:57.043
Yeah.

31:57.044 --> 31:59.711
Clamping now.

32:03.950 --> 32:06.819
[Monitor beeping steadily]

32:06.820 --> 32:08.721
You got this.

32:08.722 --> 32:09.989
She's coming back up.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.724
Everything's returning to normal.

32:11.725 --> 32:14.060
Good. [Sighs]

32:14.061 --> 32:16.262
Splenic vessels are under control.

32:16.263 --> 32:18.665
Uh, Dr. Reid?

32:18.666 --> 32:21.768
Just need a minute here.
I will have the spleen out.

32:21.769 --> 32:23.335
I need a basin.

32:28.408 --> 32:29.409
What?

32:29.410 --> 32:31.143
We got company.

32:35.114 --> 32:38.050
[Sighs]

32:45.634 --> 32:46.626
It was a procedure

32:46.627 --> 32:48.795
I've successfully executed
over a dozen times.

32:48.796 --> 32:51.164
I was confident.
I was also in my right.

32:51.165 --> 32:53.833
Except that I explicitly
pulled you from surgical duty

32:53.834 --> 32:55.802
after you embarrassed me
in front of the C.E.O.

32:55.803 --> 32:58.638
I believe my exact words were
that I would "fire your ass."

32:58.639 --> 33:00.640
She could have died, Dawn.

33:00.641 --> 33:01.841
What was I supposed to do?

33:01.842 --> 33:04.545
- You should have talked to me about it.
- I did try to talk to you.

33:04.546 --> 33:06.112
Next time, try harder!

33:06.113 --> 33:08.513
[Sighs]

33:10.250 --> 33:12.886
What is going on with you, Alex?

33:12.887 --> 33:15.121
Seriously, I don't even recognize you.

33:15.122 --> 33:18.591
You know what? I'm sorry that I
might have disappointed you today

33:18.592 --> 33:20.575
and that I'm not the doctor
that you thought I was

33:20.576 --> 33:21.959
or maybe that I even let you down.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.366
But the risk I made for
that girl, it saved her life.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.835
Any good doctor would do it.

33:28.836 --> 33:30.739
You don't agree with me,
then, yeah, go ahead...

33:30.740 --> 33:34.240
fire my ass.

33:34.241 --> 33:35.508
Do you need time off with this?

33:35.509 --> 33:37.810
No.

33:37.811 --> 33:39.579
Then prove it.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.915
Keep it together.

33:41.916 --> 33:44.184
You got a pass today
because that girl lived.

33:44.185 --> 33:46.286
Are we done?

33:46.287 --> 33:48.253
Go.

33:49.689 --> 33:52.525
Oh, and, Alex...

33:52.526 --> 33:54.227
my eyes are open.

33:54.228 --> 33:55.394
You remember that.

34:04.170 --> 34:06.505
â™ª

34:11.844 --> 34:13.846
Dr. Reid.

34:13.847 --> 34:15.380
I was hoping you'd be by.

34:15.382 --> 34:17.283
I was just finishing up a phone call.

34:17.284 --> 34:18.784
Of course.

34:18.786 --> 34:21.652
There must be a lot of sick
people eating up your time.

34:23.755 --> 34:26.592
Actually...

34:26.594 --> 34:29.262
this was an old patient...

34:29.263 --> 34:32.632
a lawyer who's agreed
to take you on, pro Bono.

34:32.632 --> 34:36.202
I figured you'd want some help
getting the paperwork in order.

34:36.203 --> 34:37.469
What paperwork?

34:37.471 --> 34:40.039
To be in control of
your own guardianship.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.174
It's a start.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.478
And then when you're ready,

34:45.478 --> 34:49.614
we can talk about what
happens in the meantime.

34:53.418 --> 34:57.190
Manny told you what you
did for me back there.

34:57.191 --> 35:00.893
Thanks for looking
out for me, Dr. Reid.

35:00.894 --> 35:02.829
You're kind of badass.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.898
That's what they tell me.

35:05.899 --> 35:07.166
[Chuckles]

35:07.167 --> 35:09.869
There was a 1-inch piece
of metal in your leg.

35:09.870 --> 35:12.472
The fall from the horse
must have dislodged it.

35:12.473 --> 35:14.641
It's lucky Dr. Harris
found it when he did.

35:14.642 --> 35:16.809
I can't believe they left
this thing inside me.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.845
Cecil: Knock, knock.

35:18.846 --> 35:20.246
Hey, Todd.

35:20.247 --> 35:22.015
Just wanted to see if you're okay.

35:22.016 --> 35:23.149
Cecil?

35:23.150 --> 35:24.250
I, um...

35:24.251 --> 35:25.852
I called the rec center,

35:25.853 --> 35:27.654
and they gave me the contact info

35:27.655 --> 35:29.689
for your re-enactment group.

35:29.690 --> 35:34.027
I appreciate that, I do,
but you don't get it.

35:34.028 --> 35:36.362
I'm out of the game. I'm dead.

35:36.363 --> 35:39.399
Well, I guess that gives
you more of a chance

35:39.400 --> 35:41.567
to be Todd for a while.

35:41.568 --> 35:44.337
Pretty sure that's who
Cecil came to see, anyway.

35:44.338 --> 35:45.772
Is that true, Cecil?

35:45.773 --> 35:47.940
Cecil: Sure, it is.

35:47.941 --> 35:50.009
Anyone who takes a header off a horse

35:50.010 --> 35:51.878
and then lives to tell about it

35:51.879 --> 35:55.014
is a man I'd be honored
to call my friend.

35:55.015 --> 35:58.985
So stop acting like a Johnny Newcombe

35:58.986 --> 36:01.521
and tell me where I can set this up.

36:01.522 --> 36:05.458
And we'll leave you to it.

36:05.459 --> 36:07.560
'59 edition?

36:07.561 --> 36:09.162
Aren't they cute?

36:09.163 --> 36:12.398
Uh, two grown men who
dress up like dead guys?

36:12.399 --> 36:14.434
I'm gonna go with, "Mm."

36:14.435 --> 36:17.203
Okay, well, sure, they're
a little weird, but...

36:17.204 --> 36:19.405
Yes, yes, Maggie.

36:19.406 --> 36:21.140
It's nice they found each other.

36:21.141 --> 36:23.876
What about you?
Do you have plans tonight?

36:23.877 --> 36:27.212
As a matter of fact, I think I do.

36:34.654 --> 36:37.824
[Monitor beeping]

36:37.825 --> 36:39.125
How's he doing?

36:39.126 --> 36:40.560
Vitals are good.

36:40.561 --> 36:42.295
Neuro should be down any second.

36:42.296 --> 36:44.564
His fingers are not great.

36:44.565 --> 36:46.499
I can't even get a cap test done.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.967
There's no obvious blood flow.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.546
Yeah, we're gonna have to amputate.

36:51.553 --> 36:53.139
Oh, well, no rush.

36:53.140 --> 36:54.674
But I'll tell plastics.

36:54.675 --> 36:56.576
- It's already done.
- Okay.

36:56.577 --> 36:58.511
Did we find out who this guy is yet?

36:58.512 --> 37:00.179
Chad Lowenfeld.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.647
He's a York student.

37:01.648 --> 37:03.671
He was out drinking with
his buddies, wandered off,

37:03.672 --> 37:05.184
and got locked in a freezer.

37:05.185 --> 37:07.120
His friends thought he took off.

37:07.121 --> 37:09.489
His family's on their way down.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.357
Billy offered to greet them.

37:11.358 --> 37:13.826
Don't worry about it, Dr. Scott.

37:13.827 --> 37:17.262
I'll take care of it, thanks.

37:22.869 --> 37:24.737
All right, okay. I give.

37:24.738 --> 37:26.259
I want you to stop being pissed at me.

37:26.260 --> 37:27.693
I'm new here. We need to get along.

37:27.694 --> 37:29.409
No, we don't.

37:29.410 --> 37:30.943
Trust me, it's a big hospital.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.378
Dude. [Scoffs]

37:32.379 --> 37:34.683
I had to work twice as hard
to get half the marks you did.

37:34.684 --> 37:36.949
So I cheated. It's as simple as that.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.117
And?

37:38.118 --> 37:40.686
And...

37:40.687 --> 37:42.121
let's hug it out?

37:42.122 --> 37:44.290
No, jackass.

37:44.291 --> 37:45.558
"I'm sorry."

37:45.559 --> 37:48.461
The words you're looking
for are "I'm sorry."

37:48.462 --> 37:51.963
Oh, dude, I already said that.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.035
No.

37:56.036 --> 37:57.470
You didn't... ever.

37:57.471 --> 37:58.838
Not back then. Not now.

37:58.839 --> 38:01.973
[Scoffs] Okay.

38:05.411 --> 38:06.813
Maybe 'cause I'm not.

38:06.814 --> 38:08.714
[Laughs]

38:08.715 --> 38:11.451
No, no. Hear me out, hear me out.

38:11.452 --> 38:13.119
Look, Dev [Sighs]

38:13.120 --> 38:14.987
I know that was a crappy time for you,

38:14.988 --> 38:17.957
but what happened back then,
it turned me around.

38:17.958 --> 38:21.127
I mean, you... you turned me around.

38:21.128 --> 38:22.361
What are you talking about?

38:22.362 --> 38:23.629
After we almost got smoked,

38:23.630 --> 38:26.032
I realized what an asshat I was,

38:26.033 --> 38:30.002
and I needed to buckle down,
get dedicated, like you were.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.772
I looked up to you.

38:32.773 --> 38:34.373
Yeah.

38:34.374 --> 38:35.675
[Chuckles]

38:35.676 --> 38:38.945
I guess you could say, uh...

38:38.946 --> 38:41.781
you...

38:41.782 --> 38:44.083
you saved my life, man.

38:44.084 --> 38:45.218
[Sobs dramatically]

38:45.219 --> 38:47.587
[Laughs]

38:47.588 --> 38:48.855
You're a psychopath.

38:48.856 --> 38:51.958
No, but I am a moderately
better human than I used to be,

38:51.959 --> 38:54.427
and you're doing fine,
so let's go drink, huh?

38:54.428 --> 38:56.462
Told some of the other
staff you're coming tonight.

38:56.463 --> 38:57.964
What, you're here for 12 hours,

38:57.965 --> 38:59.588
and you're already
friends with everyone?

38:59.589 --> 39:02.001
Well, what can I say?

39:02.002 --> 39:04.070
- I'm winsome.
- Mm.

39:04.071 --> 39:05.905
Plus, I told them
you did great impressions.

39:05.906 --> 39:08.508
- I don't, though.
- [Chuckles]

39:08.509 --> 39:11.777
I know.

39:11.778 --> 39:13.312
[Laughs]

39:13.313 --> 39:17.049
â™ª

39:17.050 --> 39:18.885
[Knock on door]

39:18.886 --> 39:20.486
I'm gonna have to take off.

39:20.487 --> 39:21.521
Oh, no. So soon?

39:21.522 --> 39:22.755
Ah, yeah, but don't worry.

39:22.756 --> 39:23.823
I'll be back in tomorrow.

39:23.824 --> 39:26.292
Is there something... Why?

39:26.293 --> 39:28.427
Just a couple loose ends.

39:28.428 --> 39:30.396
"War and Peace"?

39:30.397 --> 39:32.064
How you liking it?

39:32.065 --> 39:34.867
I haven't finished it yet.

39:34.868 --> 39:37.737
Well, you know what Tolstoy says.

39:37.738 --> 39:39.505
There are only two stories.

39:39.506 --> 39:42.841
A man goes on a journey,
and a stranger comes to town.

39:45.077 --> 39:46.913
What is this, Mr. Leffering?

39:46.914 --> 39:48.714
You tell me.

39:48.715 --> 39:50.983
It's your book.

39:50.984 --> 39:52.552
Good night, Dawn.

39:52.553 --> 39:54.186
Good night.

39:54.187 --> 39:57.423
[Shawn McDonald's "Slow Down" plays]

39:57.424 --> 39:59.625
â™ª Slow down â™ª

39:59.626 --> 40:01.961
â™ª Slow down, darling â™ª

40:01.962 --> 40:03.665
ANNOUNCER: <i>He's got
Charinski on the ropes.</i>

40:03.666 --> 40:05.264
<i>He's looking for an opening there.</i>

40:05.265 --> 40:06.432
<i>Staying hard at it.</i>

40:06.433 --> 40:07.633
â™ª Slow down â™ª

40:07.634 --> 40:09.135
- Ah.
- Oh!

40:09.136 --> 40:11.203
- That's kind of ugly.
- <i>He's pummeling him now.</i>

40:11.204 --> 40:12.772
<i>Pummeling him.</i>

40:12.773 --> 40:14.707
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:14.708 --> 40:17.542
Geez!

40:18.511 --> 40:21.247
â™ª Ah, ah, ah â™ª

40:21.248 --> 40:25.518
â™ª And smile â™ª

40:25.519 --> 40:28.754
â™ª Forever â™ª

40:28.755 --> 40:30.056
Okay.

40:30.057 --> 40:33.726
- â™ª Smile â™ª
- There.

40:33.727 --> 40:37.663
â™ª Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah â™ª

40:37.664 --> 40:39.498
You're just gonna...

40:39.499 --> 40:41.300
You gonna leave without saying goodbye?

40:41.301 --> 40:43.102
I thought we'd have a victory dance.

40:43.103 --> 40:44.604
I heard that you almost collapsed.

40:44.605 --> 40:46.072
I didn't think you could take it.

40:46.073 --> 40:48.507
Uh-huh.

40:48.508 --> 40:50.576
May I?

40:50.577 --> 40:51.811
Help you out.

40:51.812 --> 40:53.178
[Clears throat]

40:54.947 --> 40:56.882
[Laughs] That's the one you want?

40:56.883 --> 40:58.961
I was thinking maybe you could
lie across it with a bikini,

40:58.962 --> 40:59.643
kind of thing.

40:59.644 --> 41:01.547
You know, just take the
damn picture, all right?

41:01.548 --> 41:02.455
[Laughing] Okay.

41:02.456 --> 41:04.957
Alex Reid, wild woman, there you go.

41:04.958 --> 41:06.993
[Camera shutter clicks]

41:06.994 --> 41:09.027
Thank you.

41:11.564 --> 41:13.866
Uh, Manny, uh...

41:13.867 --> 41:17.136
why'd you stop believing in your path?

41:17.137 --> 41:18.440
The seminary... Why'd you leave?

41:18.441 --> 41:19.605
For real this time.

41:19.606 --> 41:21.741
You seriously want
to do this right now?

41:21.742 --> 41:23.209
I mean, it was a good day.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.177
I really want to know.

41:25.178 --> 41:28.614
Okay, earlier,
you told me that your brother,

41:28.615 --> 41:31.683
you had to help pull him
out of some rough places.

41:32.852 --> 41:34.253
Me too.

41:34.254 --> 41:36.956
Only, I didn't get there in time.

41:36.957 --> 41:38.224
He didn't make it.

41:38.225 --> 41:39.558
No, he made it,

41:39.559 --> 41:43.696
but his brain went without
oxygen for too long that, uh...

41:43.697 --> 41:46.532
that Mac doesn't even
recognize me anymore.

41:46.533 --> 41:50.403
So I suppose I had to walk that off.

41:50.404 --> 41:51.871
Walk it off?

41:51.872 --> 41:56.075
"Then Jesus was led by the Spirit

41:56.076 --> 41:58.544
into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil."

41:58.545 --> 42:00.846
Mm, sounds lonely.

42:00.847 --> 42:03.581
Not if you have some company.

42:05.451 --> 42:09.722
Alex, do you...
Do you need to walk it off?

42:09.723 --> 42:12.825
Yeah.

42:12.826 --> 42:14.894
I think I need to.

42:14.895 --> 42:17.563
Can I come?

42:17.564 --> 42:19.999
You ever see the bluffs at sunrise?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.836
â™ª It's rare that they come true â™ª
