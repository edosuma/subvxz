00:06.347 --> 00:08.608
[groaning]

00:08.652 --> 00:11.478
[sighs]

00:16.086 --> 00:17.391
Damn it!

00:17.434 --> 00:19.434
[dog barking]

00:19.478 --> 00:21.130
[phone beeps on]

00:21.173 --> 00:22.347
[phone ringing through]

00:22.391 --> 00:24.000
MAN:
Not here. Leave a message.

00:24.043 --> 00:25.173
[beep]Vince, it's me.

00:25.217 --> 00:26.608
I need to talk to you.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.260
Call me when you get this.

00:28.304 --> 00:30.130
[sighs]

00:30.173 --> 00:31.347
[phone beeps off]

00:31.391 --> 00:32.565
[clack]

00:32.608 --> 00:33.521
[dog barking]

00:33.565 --> 00:34.739
Oh, come on.

00:34.782 --> 00:36.000
[sighs]

00:44.826 --> 00:46.826
[rustling]

00:48.043 --> 00:50.000
Hello?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Somebody there?

00:55.130 --> 00:57.521
[barking]Loki.

00:57.565 --> 00:58.826
[barking]

00:58.869 --> 01:00.391
You scared me half to death.

01:00.434 --> 01:03.173
[whining and barking]Go on, get inside.

01:12.347 --> 01:13.565
[clack]

01:16.043 --> 01:17.173
[footsteps approaching]

01:17.217 --> 01:18.739
Loki, I thought I told you to...

01:18.782 --> 01:20.478
[silenced gunshots, grunting]

01:57.000 --> 01:59.391
ABBY:
Okay, open mine. Open mine.

02:00.478 --> 02:01.478
Oh.

02:01.521 --> 02:02.478
Oh.

02:02.521 --> 02:04.086
Baby's first
lab coat.

02:04.130 --> 02:05.086
Yay.
Oh.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.608
Uh, is it made of, um...?

02:06.652 --> 02:07.652
100% cotton, yes.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.782
And did you....?

02:08.826 --> 02:09.565
And I removed all
the buttons, yes.

02:09.608 --> 02:10.913
Choking hazard
averted.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.130
A-plus, Abby.
TONY:
Oh, no!

02:13.173 --> 02:14.956
You started without
me. Sorry I'm late.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.043
Tony, we thought
you forgot.

02:17.086 --> 02:18.608
Au contraire, McFrÃ¨re.

02:18.652 --> 02:20.043
I wouldn't have missed this.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.130
Been looking forward
to it for weeks.

02:22.173 --> 02:23.826
Mama Gremlin, Papa Gremlin,

02:23.869 --> 02:25.130
this basket's for you.

02:25.173 --> 02:27.043
Thank you, Tony.

02:27.086 --> 02:28.434
Let's see. Uh...

02:28.478 --> 02:32.173
Uh, industrial-grade earplugs?

02:32.217 --> 02:34.391
Yes, those are gonna
come in handy.

02:34.434 --> 02:36.043
[whispering]:
Babies are loud.

02:36.086 --> 02:37.217
[laughs]

02:37.260 --> 02:38.434
Bottle of Bordeaux.

02:38.478 --> 02:40.000
And, um...

02:40.043 --> 02:42.652
hundred dollars in cash.

02:43.478 --> 02:45.565
Tony, those are terrible gifts.

02:45.608 --> 02:47.565
Never knock the DiNozzo
parenting method.

02:47.608 --> 02:48.652
I mean,

02:48.695 --> 02:50.608
look how I turned out.

02:50.652 --> 02:52.478
[Tony laughs]

02:52.521 --> 02:53.565
[clears throat]
Um,

02:53.608 --> 02:54.739
babe?
Mm?

02:54.782 --> 02:56.478
Will you please
go get me some water?

02:56.521 --> 02:58.391
Sure, but, you know,
actually, the, uh...

02:58.434 --> 03:02.347
the pH levels up here are
really high, so don't panic.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.521
I have an emergency
stash down in Autopsy.

03:08.652 --> 03:09.652
BREENA:
Okay.

03:09.695 --> 03:11.173
Listen up, guys,
I need your help.

03:11.217 --> 03:12.695
What's wrong?

03:12.739 --> 03:15.130
It's Jimmy.
He's driving me crazy.

03:15.173 --> 03:17.217
He-he won't let me eat
or drink anything

03:17.260 --> 03:20.043
until he checks to make sure
it's safe for the baby.

03:20.086 --> 03:22.826
Oh, I mean, he's
just being cautious.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.739
All I want is peace and quiet.

03:25.782 --> 03:27.173
And a cheeseburger.

03:27.217 --> 03:28.913
You guys have
to help me.

03:28.956 --> 03:30.956
I mean, make up a case
or something.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.869
Yeah, it doesn't really
work that way.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.217
Grab your gear. Dead navy
lieutenant in Falls Church.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.391
Oh, thank God.

03:38.478 --> 03:41.391
I mean... Sorry.
That-That's awful.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.739
What do you got, Duck?

03:47.782 --> 03:49.130
Uh, gunshot wounds
to the chest.

03:49.173 --> 03:50.217
Three by the look of it.

03:50.260 --> 03:52.695
What on earth is
holding Mr. Palmer?

03:52.739 --> 03:54.608
You got anything else?
Yeah.

03:54.652 --> 03:58.000
It appears our victim engaged
in a bout of fisticuffs.

03:58.043 --> 03:59.913
If it was with his killer,

03:59.956 --> 04:01.869
we may be able to pull DNA.

04:01.913 --> 04:03.521
Time of death, Duck?

04:03.565 --> 04:06.695
Uh, around midnight
last night.

04:06.739 --> 04:07.869
[siren sounding]

04:07.913 --> 04:09.652
Boss, we got a boot print.

04:09.695 --> 04:12.043
Shooter didn't police

04:12.086 --> 04:13.217
his brass.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.695
Three .22 casings.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.956
Hmm. Not exactly dealing
with a pro.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.434
McGEE:
Well, he was
smart enough

04:20.478 --> 04:21.739
to use a silencer.

04:21.782 --> 04:23.739
Police had reports
of no gunfire.

04:23.782 --> 04:25.869
Victim?
TONY:
Navy Lieutenant

04:25.913 --> 04:27.739
Eric Kutzler, 28.

04:27.782 --> 04:29.608
Seabee assigned him
to Naval Support Unit

04:29.652 --> 04:30.869
for the State
Department.

04:30.913 --> 04:31.869
Witnesses?
Well,

04:31.913 --> 04:34.000
there was the
neighbor's dog

04:34.043 --> 04:36.043
whose name is "Lockey."

04:36.086 --> 04:38.043
It's "Loki."

04:38.086 --> 04:40.652
Loki, as in the prince
of Asgard?

04:40.695 --> 04:43.043
The god of mischief?

04:43.086 --> 04:44.565
From the Thor comics, Tony.

04:44.608 --> 04:47.826
Thor. The nerds
are taking over.

04:47.869 --> 04:49.391
It's just you and me now, boss.

04:50.695 --> 04:52.043
I'm-I'm gonna
go check the...

04:52.086 --> 04:53.782
gonna check the house.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.391
I'll question the neighbors.

04:55.434 --> 04:58.217
[siren toots]I'm gonna go take
photos someplace else.

05:01.130 --> 05:03.478
Looks like a broken
drinking glass.

05:03.521 --> 05:05.869
Could be from a struggle.

05:05.913 --> 05:08.695
But, hmm, nothing else
looks tossed.

05:08.739 --> 05:10.565
TONY:
Not exactly.

05:12.739 --> 05:14.826
Check this out.

05:16.521 --> 05:17.782
Well, that's blood.

05:17.826 --> 05:19.391
From what?

05:19.434 --> 05:22.347
I think we found the source of
our victim's battered knuckles.

05:24.608 --> 05:26.652
You were the first officer
on the scene?

05:26.695 --> 05:28.695
That's correct.

05:28.739 --> 05:31.478
What time was that?
Uh,

05:31.521 --> 05:32.869
I'm not certain.

05:32.913 --> 05:36.000
I-I got off shift, um,
a little after 8:00. Uh...

05:36.043 --> 05:37.826
Off shift?

05:37.869 --> 05:40.652
[voice breaking]:
I checked his vitals...

05:40.695 --> 05:43.869
but I knew... he was gone.

05:43.913 --> 05:46.043
You knew the victim?

05:48.086 --> 05:50.043
He's my husband.

05:50.086 --> 05:53.565
I left for work last
night around 7:00,

05:53.608 --> 05:56.043
and Eric wa-was fine.

05:56.086 --> 05:58.043
Everything was normal.

05:58.086 --> 06:00.304
He called my cell
at around midnight...[phone ringing]

06:00.347 --> 06:02.652
...but I didn't get the message
till this morning.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.391
McGEE:
Well, if you think of
anything, you have my card.

06:04.434 --> 06:06.130
Excuse me a minute. McGee.

06:07.173 --> 06:08.565
It's Gibbs.

06:08.608 --> 06:10.608
Yeah, I'm on my way.

06:12.173 --> 06:13.347
Kutzler's husband...
Right.

06:13.391 --> 06:14.782
[door opens]

06:16.173 --> 06:17.695
Jethro.

06:17.739 --> 06:19.826
Hollis.

06:19.869 --> 06:22.565
Leon.

06:22.608 --> 06:25.434
Now that roll call is over,
shall we move on to business?

06:25.478 --> 06:26.913
Hollis was sent by the DoD

06:26.956 --> 06:29.652
to assist
with your investigation, Gibbs.

06:31.043 --> 06:33.000
Hell of a winter, huh?

06:36.565 --> 06:39.434
What's, uh, DoD's interest
in the case?

06:39.478 --> 06:41.521
Lieutenant Kutzler.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.608
He'd been on our
radar for some time,

06:43.652 --> 06:45.652
and I'd been investigating
him for the last two weeks.

06:45.695 --> 06:47.652
Investigating him for what?

06:47.695 --> 06:49.565
He was being vetted.

06:49.608 --> 06:51.869
Lieutenant Kutzler is
in consideration

06:51.913 --> 06:53.782
for the Medal of Honor.

07:12.652 --> 07:14.608
Gibbs and Hollis Mann,

07:14.652 --> 07:16.043
both in the
director's office.

07:16.086 --> 07:17.695
You know what this means?

07:17.739 --> 07:19.695
That she's helping
with our case?

07:19.739 --> 07:21.826
Think bigger
picture, Bishop.

07:21.869 --> 07:24.478
You know how on edge
Gibbs has been lately.

07:24.521 --> 07:28.652
Well, yeah, since Diane's death,
he's had a lot on his mind.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.565
Exactly.

07:30.608 --> 07:34.608
And he's not gonna talk to us
about his feelings and emotions.

07:34.652 --> 07:38.739
But Hollis Mann-- she speaks
his monosyllabic language.

07:39.956 --> 07:41.217
She's our Gibbs whisperer.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.043
[Hollis clears her throat]

07:43.086 --> 07:44.478
Ah. How did you...?

07:44.521 --> 07:45.260
Update.

07:45.304 --> 07:46.434
Uh...

07:46.478 --> 07:47.652
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

07:47.695 --> 07:49.478
Let's go.
Just...

07:51.086 --> 07:53.521
BISHOP:
Our victim is Eric Kutzler,
a lieutenant

07:53.565 --> 07:55.217
in the Navy
Construction Battalion.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.782
I spoke to his supervisor
at the State Department.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.565
Kutzler was new to the command,

07:59.608 --> 08:01.130
reported there five months ago.

08:01.173 --> 08:02.826
Prior to that,
he spent 18 months

08:02.869 --> 08:04.086
at Walter Reed, recovering

08:04.130 --> 08:05.695
from injuries sustained
in Afghanistan.

08:05.739 --> 08:06.782
Click the thing.

08:06.826 --> 08:08.652
Kutzler's Seabees
unit was on a

08:08.695 --> 08:11.304
humanitarian mission in
the Punjab Province when

08:11.347 --> 08:13.521
they were ambushed.And while they were pinned down

08:13.565 --> 08:15.434
waiting for air support,

08:15.478 --> 08:17.391
an enemy grenade
penetrated their ranks.

08:17.434 --> 08:19.260
Kutzler threw himself over it,

08:19.304 --> 08:21.260
saving the lives
of two of his men.

08:21.304 --> 08:23.956
He jumped on a live grenade
and survived?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.347
Almost didn't.

08:25.391 --> 08:26.913
Kutzler was a fighter.

08:26.956 --> 08:28.260
And a hero.

08:28.304 --> 08:30.043
Who someone was targeting.

08:30.086 --> 08:32.739
Well, Kutzler made a name
for himself back in 2011.

08:32.782 --> 08:34.521
He spoke at several rallies

08:34.565 --> 08:36.826
in the months leading up to the
repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell.

08:36.869 --> 08:38.043
Which is why

08:38.086 --> 08:40.043
there are so many eyes
on his nomination.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.695
Kutzler would be the first
openly gay service member

08:42.739 --> 08:44.347
to receive the Medal of Honor.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.913
You think this
was a hate crime?

08:45.956 --> 08:47.913
Some people
don't like change.

08:49.478 --> 08:51.478
So, where are we on suspects?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.739
We?

08:54.782 --> 08:57.695
You're not here to investigate
Kutzler's murder.

08:57.739 --> 09:01.130
The DoD has a vested interest
in this case, Jethro.

09:02.739 --> 09:04.695
I'll be sticking around.

09:09.608 --> 09:12.260
Blood delivery
for Miss Abby Sciuto.

09:12.304 --> 09:13.739
He just walked in.

09:13.782 --> 09:15.478
She's talking
to Breena.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.521
Breena says don't be angry,

09:17.565 --> 09:19.043
but she went to
Beltway Burger.

09:19.086 --> 09:20.086
No!

09:20.130 --> 09:21.391
Uh-huh.

09:21.434 --> 09:22.347
All right,
I'll tell him.

09:22.391 --> 09:23.652
Okay. Bye, Breena.

09:23.695 --> 09:25.043
What? What? Tell me what.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.739
Abby, what else?
What? What?

09:26.782 --> 09:28.043
She didn't...

09:28.086 --> 09:29.043
It's okay.

09:29.086 --> 09:30.304
Breena's fine.

09:30.347 --> 09:32.000
Breathe.
[exhales
and inhales]

09:32.043 --> 09:34.478
Good. Now hurry up

09:34.521 --> 09:36.869
and get to the hospital
because Breena is in labor.

09:38.521 --> 09:41.521
Jimmy, did you
hear what she said?

09:41.565 --> 09:43.956
She just said
Breena's having a baby.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.652
I think you
broke him.What do we do?

09:47.304 --> 09:49.260
[stammering]
Baby go bag!

09:49.304 --> 09:50.565
I need my baby go bag!

09:50.608 --> 09:52.478
Uh, this is not a drill!

09:52.521 --> 09:54.478
Incoming! Father
coming through!

09:54.521 --> 09:56.347
Good luck, Jimmy!
Good job, Gibbs.

09:56.391 --> 09:57.652
What do we got?

09:57.695 --> 09:59.347
Uh, Big Brother,
or more like

09:59.391 --> 10:03.130
Big Brother's distant
relatives, twice removed.

10:03.173 --> 10:04.782
She means, uh,
surveillance footage

10:04.826 --> 10:07.217
from Kutzler's next-door
neighbor's security system.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.304
His backyard camera had
a direct line of sight

10:09.347 --> 10:11.434
to where
Kutzler was shot.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.695
Do we have the
killer on tape?

10:12.739 --> 10:14.652
On tape?

10:14.695 --> 10:16.260
Well, no, not tape

10:16.304 --> 10:18.043
since, like, the 1990s,
but we have footage.

10:19.391 --> 10:22.695
[computer beeping and trilling]

10:22.739 --> 10:25.043
That's all you see.

10:25.086 --> 10:26.652
The killer never
faced the camera.

10:26.695 --> 10:27.869
What else?

10:27.913 --> 10:30.521
Vince Armstrong stated
that he arrived home,

10:30.565 --> 10:32.434
found Kutzler's body,

10:32.478 --> 10:34.217
then he immediately
called 911.

10:34.260 --> 10:38.043
Well, this footage shows that
at 8:26 a.m., he finds the body,

10:38.086 --> 10:39.478
goes back into the house,

10:39.521 --> 10:41.652
and does not
call the police.

10:41.695 --> 10:44.913
911 logs his call at 8:48 a.m.

10:44.956 --> 10:46.521
That's 20 minutes later.

10:46.565 --> 10:48.347
Armstrong lied to us, boss.

10:48.391 --> 10:50.826
Where is he?He's with a CACO officer.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.260
I've answered
all your questions.

10:55.304 --> 10:57.565
Why aren't you out
canvassing the neighborhood?

10:57.608 --> 10:59.391
Well, here's what's sticking
for us, Vince.

10:59.434 --> 11:01.347
You find your husband
dead and then you decide

11:01.391 --> 11:03.043
to take a 20-minute
breather before

11:03.086 --> 11:04.869
calling 911-- that
doesn't look good for you.

11:04.913 --> 11:06.260
I was in shock.

11:06.304 --> 11:09.000
You and Kutzler having issues?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.739
Any heated arguments
between you two?

11:10.782 --> 11:12.521
Of course-- we're married.

11:12.565 --> 11:13.913
Fair enough.

11:13.956 --> 11:15.217
What about that cut
under your eye?

11:15.260 --> 11:17.391
Got it pulling over
a drunk driver.

11:17.434 --> 11:19.347
No one's ever taken
a swing at you on the job?

11:19.391 --> 11:21.217
I find that very
hard to believe.

11:21.260 --> 11:23.434
You do have a face
people naturally dislike.

11:23.478 --> 11:25.347
What?Check my dash cam

11:25.391 --> 11:27.043
if you don't believe me.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.347
Yeah, we're gonna
get to that. But first, um,

11:29.391 --> 11:32.347
why don't you tell us
about your discharge

11:32.391 --> 11:35.086
from the Marine Corps in 2007?

11:36.478 --> 11:38.043
What was the reason
for the discharge, McGee?

11:38.086 --> 11:39.434
Conduct unbecoming.

11:39.478 --> 11:40.826
That was it.

11:40.869 --> 11:42.695
What does that
have to do with anything?

11:42.739 --> 11:44.652
That was years ago.Well,

11:44.695 --> 11:46.608
It says you exhibited
a violent temper

11:46.652 --> 11:48.826
and made threats against
your superior officer.

11:48.869 --> 11:51.217
That's a lie. All of it.

11:51.260 --> 11:53.434
No temper. Got it.

11:53.478 --> 11:56.217
Look, I've worked homicides.
I know how critical

11:56.260 --> 11:58.304
the first 48 hours
are in solving this case.

11:58.347 --> 12:02.347
You're wasting precious time.
I didn't kill my husband.

12:02.391 --> 12:03.956
Let's take a walk.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.260
Oh. I'm all for some midday
cardio, boss, but I just ate

12:06.304 --> 12:07.478
and we're in the middle of...

12:07.521 --> 12:09.304
Not you.

12:09.347 --> 12:10.652
You.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.000
Now, Marine.

12:20.434 --> 12:22.739
I know this interrogation
tactic, Agent Gibbs.

12:22.782 --> 12:25.000
Change the location...

12:25.043 --> 12:26.478
try to catch
the subject off-guard.

12:26.521 --> 12:27.826
How's it working?It's not.

12:27.869 --> 12:30.347
Didn't think so.So where are we going?

12:30.391 --> 12:32.304
Details were missing
from your service record.

12:32.347 --> 12:35.217
So I made a few calls. You were
one squared away Marine.

12:35.260 --> 12:38.173
Top marks,
stellar FITREPs,

12:38.217 --> 12:40.217
commendations.

12:41.217 --> 12:44.000
Until 2007.

12:44.043 --> 12:47.217
When your command
found out you were gay.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.217
I never threatened my C.O.

12:51.260 --> 12:53.217
They trumped up those charges.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.043
Said if I went quietly,
they would give me

12:55.086 --> 12:57.782
a general discharge
instead of a dishonorable one.

12:57.826 --> 13:01.000
I had to think of my future.

13:01.043 --> 13:02.260
Why become a cop?

13:02.304 --> 13:06.217
All I ever wanted
to do was to help people.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.043
Protect. Serve.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.739
But what's the point
if you can't even

13:09.782 --> 13:11.304
protect the ones
you care about?

13:11.347 --> 13:14.652
I loved Eric.

13:14.695 --> 13:16.782
I would never hurt him.

13:16.826 --> 13:19.956
See, I think you're
hiding something.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.043
I'm guessing it's to
protect your partner.

13:22.086 --> 13:25.043
Eric deserves to be remembered
for what he was: a hero.

13:25.086 --> 13:26.173
Nothing should change that.

13:26.217 --> 13:29.043
My job is to find
who killed him,

13:29.086 --> 13:32.652
not start a witch hunt,
and you need to trust me.

13:38.260 --> 13:41.000
When I came home this morning,
there was a bag in the kitchen.

13:41.043 --> 13:42.391
I hadn't seen it before.

13:42.434 --> 13:45.086
There was vials and syringes.

13:45.130 --> 13:47.434
I don't know why Eric
had them, but they're not his.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.304
How can you be
sure of that?He had his

13:49.347 --> 13:53.043
demons, but drugs wasn't
one of them. I would know.

13:54.173 --> 13:55.782
Where'd you hide them?

13:57.173 --> 13:58.391
In the garage.

13:58.434 --> 13:59.956
I shouldn't have
touched the crime scene,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.043
but I knew it would make
Eric look bad and I didn't

14:02.086 --> 14:04.130
want it to affect his
Medal of Honor nomination.

14:04.173 --> 14:05.521
My husband

14:05.565 --> 14:08.478
was a good man,
Agent Gibbs.

14:10.173 --> 14:12.739
I couldn't save his life.

14:14.130 --> 14:17.130
But please...

14:17.173 --> 14:19.260
please...

14:19.304 --> 14:22.478
help me protect his memory.

14:40.608 --> 14:42.173
What's the latest, Team Babbs?

14:42.217 --> 14:44.000
Uh, just got an
update from Jimmy.

14:44.043 --> 14:46.913
Breena is still in labor.
He sounded a little freaked.

14:46.956 --> 14:48.652
Jimmy's gonna be a father.

14:48.695 --> 14:50.043
It's like, one day

14:50.086 --> 14:51.739
you're just... you're you,

14:51.782 --> 14:54.913
and then the next day
you're responsible for this

14:54.956 --> 14:57.217
living, breathing soul.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.434
I hate to interrupt, Abbs,
but Hurricane Gibbs

14:59.478 --> 15:01.521
is about to make landfall.
What do you got?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.739
Kutzler's tox screen--

15:04.782 --> 15:07.304
it's clean. He
wasn't on drugs.

15:07.347 --> 15:09.130
What about the narcotics

15:09.173 --> 15:12.130
we confiscated from his garage?Each vial

15:12.173 --> 15:15.043
contains pharmaceutical-grade
morphine and fentanyl.

15:15.086 --> 15:16.826
Mixed together,
they make one

15:16.869 --> 15:19.173
very potent
intravenous cocktail.

15:19.217 --> 15:20.608
Which brings me
to my next point.

15:20.652 --> 15:23.130
This batch is homemade.
I mean, this distinct

15:23.173 --> 15:25.260
color and this
labeling--

15:25.304 --> 15:27.608
this is somebody's brand.Hmm.

15:27.652 --> 15:29.478
Somebody who's seen a little
too much Breaking Bad.

15:29.521 --> 15:31.086
Miss that show.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.260
Just one vial of this stuff
fetches a steep

15:33.304 --> 15:35.565
take on the street.So if
Kutzler wasn't

15:35.608 --> 15:38.695
taking drugs, maybe
he was selling them?

15:38.739 --> 15:42.086
War hero to drug peddler--
that's a big shift.

15:42.130 --> 15:44.000
Well, if they weren't
Kutzler's drugs,

15:44.043 --> 15:45.478
they belonged to someone.

15:45.521 --> 15:47.521
Someone willing
to kill for them.

15:54.739 --> 15:58.000
[door opens]DUCKY: Ah, Hollis,
have you seen Jethro?

15:58.043 --> 16:00.043
I just left word for him.

16:00.086 --> 16:04.173
I have the sneaking suspicion
he's trying to avoid me, Doctor.

16:04.217 --> 16:06.434
Did you know
the lieutenant well?

16:06.478 --> 16:09.043
No, we met once, last week.

16:09.086 --> 16:10.478
I was fact-checking
his account

16:10.521 --> 16:13.086
of the ambush
for the nomination.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.782
I could see he was
still haunted by it.

16:15.826 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, well, the body
can recover physically.

16:19.043 --> 16:23.043
Healing the mind, however,
is a little more complex.

16:23.086 --> 16:26.826
Listen, I heard about Diane.

16:26.869 --> 16:28.826
How's Jethro been doing?

16:28.869 --> 16:30.956
I reached out,
but he hasn't returned

16:31.000 --> 16:33.130
any of my calls.Well,

16:33.173 --> 16:36.304
Jethro does prefer to throw
himself into his work.
Well,

16:36.347 --> 16:39.130
I'm trying to be there for him.
He's not letting me.

16:39.173 --> 16:41.130
A friendship with Jethro

16:41.173 --> 16:43.521
does have its share
of challenges.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.130
[short chuckle]However, I suspect

16:45.173 --> 16:48.956
that there may be
another reason

16:49.000 --> 16:52.043
why he's been keeping us
all at a distance.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.695
[elevator dings]

16:53.739 --> 16:55.956
Ducky, you called me.Uh,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.130
yes, I found
something unusual in

16:58.173 --> 17:00.695
Lieutenant Kutzler's
toxicology.

17:00.739 --> 17:02.217
Abby said it was clean.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.043
Well, that's
the anomaly.

17:04.086 --> 17:05.782
There are no
traces of any

17:05.826 --> 17:08.217
medical substances
in his bloodstream.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.869
I'm not seeing
the problem here, Duck.

17:09.913 --> 17:13.260
When the lieutenant threw
himself on that grenade,

17:13.304 --> 17:17.000
his body absorbed
the force of the explosion.

17:17.043 --> 17:20.652
His torso took the full
impact, breaking his ribs

17:20.695 --> 17:22.913
and collapsing
his lungs.

17:22.956 --> 17:24.391
This flak jacket

17:24.434 --> 17:27.391
protected his vital organs
from the shrapnel.

17:27.434 --> 17:28.956
The blast blew upwards,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.347
fracturing his right arm
almost beyond repair.

17:32.391 --> 17:33.652
It severed his jawbone,

17:33.695 --> 17:36.130
tore through
his right eye socket,

17:36.173 --> 17:38.608
and fractured his skull. Mm.

17:38.652 --> 17:41.652
He suffered catastrophic wounds.

17:41.695 --> 17:45.391
Consequently, he was prescribed
with numerous medications

17:45.434 --> 17:48.043
to aid in the recovery.

17:48.086 --> 17:51.347
But look, he never filled
a single prescription.

17:51.391 --> 17:55.086
He chose to live
in constant pain.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.913
Kutzler felt
responsible

17:56.956 --> 17:59.565
for the men lost
in the ambush.

17:59.608 --> 18:03.391
The pain was his
punishment for surviving.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.173
Anyone else feel
he was at fault?

18:05.217 --> 18:07.043
No one that I've
spoken to so far, but

18:07.086 --> 18:08.739
Kutzler was apprehensive
when I mentioned

18:08.782 --> 18:10.608
that I was gonna be
talking to the witnesses.

18:10.652 --> 18:12.826
I want the details
of that ambush.

18:12.869 --> 18:14.391
The events leading up to it,

18:14.434 --> 18:15.956
the casualties, the survivors,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.695
every insurgent
involved. Everything.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.869
TONY:
Of the seven survivors, five

18:23.913 --> 18:26.478
were Afghan civilians.
McGee and Dorneget are in MTAC

18:26.521 --> 18:28.913
tracking 'em down now.The remaining two survivors

18:28.956 --> 18:30.913
were sailors
in Kutzler's Seabee unit.

18:30.956 --> 18:33.130
First is Senior Chief
Lansing Donahue,

18:33.173 --> 18:35.000
45, lives in

18:35.043 --> 18:37.478
Sea Isle City, New Jersey.Well, I've already
questioned Donahue.

18:37.521 --> 18:39.478
His statement of facts
on the incident

18:39.521 --> 18:41.565
was pivotal in Kutzler's
Medal of Honor

18:41.608 --> 18:43.260
consideration.
He's not your guy.

18:43.304 --> 18:45.043
Well, the other survivor
is Petty Officer

18:45.086 --> 18:47.217
Third Class
Davis Riley, 28.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.217
Discharged in 2012.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.695
He works in construction now.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.217
Riley's sitting down
with me next week.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.434
No. Today.

18:54.478 --> 18:56.521
Uh, I might have something.

18:56.565 --> 18:57.956
Putting it
up now.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.347
In the week prior to the ambush,

18:59.391 --> 19:01.043
Kutzler
received a letter

19:01.086 --> 19:03.173
of reprimand for
disorderly conduct.

19:03.217 --> 19:05.652
There's no mention of that
in Kutzler's service record.

19:05.695 --> 19:07.304
That's because

19:07.347 --> 19:10.478
it was later retracted by the
issuer, his commanding officer,

19:10.521 --> 19:12.478
Rear Admiral Xavier Meade.

19:12.521 --> 19:13.869
Where is Meade now?Uh, stationed

19:13.913 --> 19:16.956
at the Navy Expedition
Combat Command in Norfolk.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.043
Bishop, you're
with me.

19:18.086 --> 19:19.652
DiNozzo, you got Hollis.

19:23.260 --> 19:26.434
Kutzler was a fine officer.

19:26.478 --> 19:29.000
Smart, determined.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.608
I'm not surprised he was up
for the Medal of Honor.

19:31.652 --> 19:33.391
Is.Pardon?

19:33.434 --> 19:35.521
Is. You said was.

19:35.565 --> 19:38.869
Kutzler-- he's still
being considered.

19:38.913 --> 19:40.956
Of course.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.695
He went to hell
and back for his men.

19:43.739 --> 19:45.739
Damn shame.

19:45.782 --> 19:48.869
Did the two of you get along?The lieutenant

19:48.913 --> 19:50.782
and I got along as well
as any superior officer

19:50.826 --> 19:53.478
and subordinate can
in the military.

19:53.521 --> 19:55.782
I had no issues with Kutzler.

19:55.826 --> 19:59.130
Except for the letter of
reprimand you wrote in his file.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.956
I see you are
extremely thorough.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.434
Oh, yeah. She's
good like that.

20:05.478 --> 20:07.217
You're also way off base.

20:07.260 --> 20:09.826
Enlighten us.

20:09.869 --> 20:11.826
When Kutzler's unit
arrived in Afghanistan,

20:11.869 --> 20:14.826
there were growing pains.

20:14.869 --> 20:18.347
Some men took issue
with his open homosexuality.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.782
Don't Ask Don't Tell
had already been repealed.

20:20.826 --> 20:23.000
Kutzler was within
his rights to be out.

20:23.043 --> 20:24.739
I agree.

20:24.782 --> 20:26.217
But changing a law
doesn't suddenly

20:26.260 --> 20:27.956
change people's beliefs.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
What happened?

20:30.043 --> 20:32.217
He and a fellow sailor
exchanged words

20:32.260 --> 20:34.913
in the chow line,
a brawl ensued.

20:34.956 --> 20:37.695
Being an officer, Kutzler
was held to a higher standard.

20:37.739 --> 20:39.826
Written reprimand was protocol.

20:39.869 --> 20:43.130
So why'd you later
pull it from his record?

20:44.913 --> 20:46.826
It didn't sit well with me.

20:46.869 --> 20:50.347
A reprimand like that would
have ruined Kutzler's career.

20:50.391 --> 20:53.826
I retracted it, gave him
a verbal warning instead.

20:53.869 --> 20:55.826
What about the sailor
he fought with?

20:55.869 --> 20:58.739
Petty Officer Davis Riley.

20:58.782 --> 21:02.130
No love lost
between those two.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.826
TONY:
I kind of love the smell
of construction.

21:04.869 --> 21:07.434
Lumber and sawdust.

21:07.478 --> 21:10.173
It's kind of like
Gibbs' basement.

21:10.217 --> 21:13.043
Speaking
of Gibbs...

21:13.086 --> 21:14.739
Subtle, DiNozzo.

21:14.782 --> 21:17.739
Normally we would rely on
Fornell to bring Gibbs back

21:17.782 --> 21:20.565
to his general
disgruntled self,

21:20.608 --> 21:23.391
but Tobias isn't really
an option these days.

21:23.434 --> 21:25.652
Look, I'm his friend.

21:25.695 --> 21:28.043
I'm not his shrink.
I can't force him to talk to me.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.347
Sure you can.[door opens]

21:29.391 --> 21:31.826
You can be persuasive.

21:34.521 --> 21:35.739
Davis Riley?

21:35.782 --> 21:37.043
Can I help you?

21:37.086 --> 21:38.782
NCIS.

21:38.826 --> 21:40.521
Hollis Mann, DoD.
We spoke on the phone

21:40.565 --> 21:42.391
earlier.Oh, right, yeah.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.130
Uh, I thought we were
meeting next week.

21:44.173 --> 21:45.782
Change
of plans.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.826
Where were you last night
around midnight?

21:47.869 --> 21:51.304
Uh... I was at my
apartment, asleep.

21:51.347 --> 21:53.739
Any witnesses?To me sleeping?

21:53.782 --> 21:56.086
Am I missing something? I
thought you wanted to talk to me

21:56.130 --> 21:57.608
about Kutzler's
nomination packet.

21:57.652 --> 21:59.347
I did.Yes.

21:59.391 --> 22:00.956
And she's going to, but...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.260
I'd like to talk
to you about his murder.

22:03.304 --> 22:04.826
Murder?

22:04.869 --> 22:07.695
HOLLIS:
Lieutenant Kutzler was
shot and killed last night.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.521
Oh, my God.

22:10.565 --> 22:12.826
[panting]:
I...

22:12.869 --> 22:15.043
I'm gonna be sick.

22:15.086 --> 22:17.217
[Davis retching]

22:19.652 --> 22:22.652
I hated everything
about Kutzler.

22:24.695 --> 22:26.652
I didn't understand him.

22:26.695 --> 22:29.000
Didn't want to.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.130
I just wanted him gone.

22:31.173 --> 22:33.782
Is this a confession?

22:34.826 --> 22:36.173
Of the oldme.

22:36.217 --> 22:38.739
I'm not that guy anymore;
I've changed.

22:38.782 --> 22:41.739
What a miraculous
and conveniently timed

22:41.782 --> 22:43.608
change of heart.Afghanistan was

22:43.652 --> 22:46.782
a wake-up call-- there was
nothing convenient about it.

22:49.652 --> 22:53.652
One minute... we're
laying foundation for a school,

22:53.695 --> 22:55.608
the next, we're
pinned down by insurgents,

22:55.652 --> 22:58.043
taking heavy fire.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.956
Five of our guys
fall before they can
even get to cover.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.521
Chief and I were hit
but not critical.

23:04.565 --> 23:07.869
Kutzler was applying
my tourniquet...

23:07.913 --> 23:10.695
when we saw the grenade.

23:13.434 --> 23:15.739
He didn't hesitate.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.217
Not even for a split second.
He just...

23:19.260 --> 23:22.000
dove on top of it.

23:23.739 --> 23:26.478
After that, I saw Kutzler
for what he was-- a hero.

23:27.869 --> 23:30.086
Why else would I put him up
for the Medal of Honor?

23:30.130 --> 23:33.739
Kutzler's nomination packet was
initiated by Senator Gundersen.

23:33.782 --> 23:35.565
There's no statement

23:35.608 --> 23:37.086
of yours on file.

23:37.130 --> 23:40.086
How-how is that...
even possible?

23:40.130 --> 23:43.652
Chief Donahue and I routed that
up our chain of command

23:43.695 --> 23:45.217
back in 2012.

23:45.260 --> 23:48.782
Military award packets
don't just... disappear.

23:48.826 --> 23:51.000
I don't suppose
you have any proof?

23:51.043 --> 23:53.869
Well, I didn't make a copy,
if that's what you mean.

23:53.913 --> 23:57.043
Ask Chief Donahue--
he can vouch for me.

23:57.086 --> 23:58.521
Kutzler saved my life.

23:58.565 --> 24:01.956
I was trying to do right by him.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.217
I... yes, sir, I believe
that's a bit premature,

24:04.260 --> 24:05.347
but it...

24:05.391 --> 24:07.304
Yes, sir.

24:07.347 --> 24:09.086
Yes, I understand,
but our agents are working

24:09.130 --> 24:11.521
around the clock to...

24:11.565 --> 24:12.869
Yes, sir.

24:12.913 --> 24:14.478
I understand.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.652
[sets handset
in cradle]

24:16.695 --> 24:18.260
Secretary of Defense.

24:18.304 --> 24:21.565
The press got wind
that a potential Medal
of Honor nominee

24:21.608 --> 24:24.260
was found dead with illegal
narcotics in his possession.

24:24.304 --> 24:25.565
How?

24:25.608 --> 24:28.043
That's the million-
dollar question, Gibbs.

24:28.086 --> 24:30.173
News outlets
are running with the story.

24:30.217 --> 24:32.391
We don't even know
what the story is yet.

24:32.434 --> 24:34.391
That's never stopped
the press before.

24:34.434 --> 24:36.304
And that's not all.

24:36.347 --> 24:38.304
They're not canceling
Kutzler's nomination?

24:38.347 --> 24:41.652
This case has got a lot
of people on the Hill
extremely nervous.

24:41.695 --> 24:43.608
Tarnishing
the nation's highest honor

24:43.652 --> 24:45.478
is not an acceptable risk.Neither is

24:45.521 --> 24:47.608
tarnishing
a naval officer's reputation.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.956
I don't like it
any more than you do.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.260
DoD's giving us
48 hours to clear

24:52.304 --> 24:53.521
Kutzler's name.

24:53.565 --> 24:56.652
After that, it's
out of our hands.

25:14.086 --> 25:17.478
McGEE:
Oh, this is bad, Tony.
This is really, really bad.

25:17.521 --> 25:19.913
Okay. We're at
DEFCON 1, McGee.

25:19.956 --> 25:21.956
Let's raise
the Gibbs Threat Level.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.043
I grabbed every newspaper
in the building.

25:24.086 --> 25:25.086
All right,
let's huddle up.

25:26.347 --> 25:28.304
So our mission now
is damage control.

25:28.347 --> 25:29.826
What we need to do is

25:29.869 --> 25:31.869
stick together--
this, too, shall pass.

25:31.913 --> 25:33.869
GIBBS: Hey, where are we?TONY [whispers]: Albatross.

25:33.913 --> 25:36.173
GIBBS:
You're all just standing around.

25:36.217 --> 25:38.000
You'd better have an update.

25:38.043 --> 25:41.608
TONY:
Yeah. Well, we're, we're still
tracking Kutzler's movements

25:41.652 --> 25:44.347
the night of the murder.
No witnesses saw him
after 7:00 p.m.,

25:44.391 --> 25:46.565
no credit card charges,
and his cell phone pinged

25:46.608 --> 25:48.043
from the same
location all day.

25:48.086 --> 25:50.086
His home.
Doesn't look like

25:50.130 --> 25:51.869
Kutzler ever
left, boss.

25:51.913 --> 25:54.565
Abby's working
on his vehicle's GPS, but...

25:54.608 --> 25:55.869
But?

25:56.695 --> 25:57.826
Where is Hollis Mann?

25:57.869 --> 26:00.086
I... I think
she went back to the DoD.

26:00.130 --> 26:01.652
You think?

26:01.695 --> 26:04.043
What do you...
what do you mean... you think?

26:04.086 --> 26:05.391
Uh...

26:05.434 --> 26:06.913
We've been at this all night.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.130
Uh, we're all a little tired--
why don't we take a break,

26:09.173 --> 26:10.347
get some air?No, there is no break.

26:10.391 --> 26:12.347
There's no breaks
until this case breaks.

26:12.391 --> 26:15.000
Never get personally involved
in a case--

26:15.043 --> 26:16.695
you're breaking rule
number ten, boss.

26:16.739 --> 26:20.217
You're damn right I am, DiNozzo.
Do you have a problem with that?

26:20.260 --> 26:21.478
Boss...

26:22.478 --> 26:23.652
Uh, boss?

26:23.695 --> 26:25.000
VINCE:
Is this what you meant

26:25.043 --> 26:26.782
when you said trust you,
Agent Gibbs?

26:26.826 --> 26:29.043
Our office had nothing
to do with that.They're dragging Eric's name

26:29.086 --> 26:31.434
through the mud-- it is exactly
what I was afraid would happen.

26:31.478 --> 26:32.869
Why don't we take this
to the conference room?No, no, no.

26:32.913 --> 26:34.695
There's nothing to talk about.

26:34.739 --> 26:36.826
The damage is already done.

26:36.869 --> 26:40.260
I thought you were
a man of honor.

26:40.304 --> 26:42.130
You got me.

26:42.173 --> 26:44.869
Hey, but what's one
dead gay sailor, right?

26:51.478 --> 26:54.086
ABBY:
Oh, no. Poor Gibbs.

26:54.130 --> 26:55.521
Maybe I should
go give him a hug.

26:55.565 --> 26:57.347
I think he'd prefer
a lead, Abby.

26:57.391 --> 26:59.260
I can help with that, too.Did you get anything

26:59.304 --> 27:00.782
from Kutzler's GPS system?

27:00.826 --> 27:02.347
I did.

27:02.391 --> 27:03.739
So, Kutzler did

27:03.782 --> 27:05.869
leave his house
the night of the murder,

27:05.913 --> 27:08.391
but he didn't use his vehicle's
navigation function.

27:08.434 --> 27:10.478
Turns out this
particular software,

27:10.521 --> 27:12.695
it receives hourly
satellite updates

27:12.739 --> 27:14.739
and it generates a log.

27:14.782 --> 27:18.304
At 8:45, the update places

27:18.347 --> 27:20.913
Kutzler's vehicle
at his residence.

27:20.956 --> 27:22.782
At 9:45 and 10:45,

27:22.826 --> 27:24.782
he's at a location
in Berwyn, Maryland.

27:24.826 --> 27:27.478
And at 11:45, he's
back at his house.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.956
What's the location in Maryland?

27:29.000 --> 27:29.652
[tapping keyboard]

27:29.695 --> 27:31.347
The Berwyn Community

27:31.391 --> 27:33.956
Outreach Center.Excellent.
Thank you, Abby.

27:40.782 --> 27:43.347
Excuse me.

27:43.391 --> 27:45.304
Bestow an angel!

27:45.347 --> 27:47.304
[sighs]What's yourname,
bright eyes?

27:47.347 --> 27:48.478
She's Special Agent Bishop.

27:48.521 --> 27:50.347
I'm Special Agent DiNozzo.

27:50.391 --> 27:51.347
"Mat."

27:51.391 --> 27:53.173
You're missing
a "T" there, buddy.

27:53.217 --> 27:54.608
Like "doormat"?

27:54.652 --> 27:56.260
I dropped the second
"T" years ago.
Life's not about

27:56.304 --> 27:59.043
conforming to society's
phallocentric norms.

28:00.260 --> 28:02.347
Homemade gluten-free
vegan cinnamon scone?

28:02.391 --> 28:03.391
Ooh.

28:03.434 --> 28:05.043
TONY:
No.

28:05.086 --> 28:06.391
Are you nuts?

28:06.434 --> 28:08.782
Never take cookies
or movie advice from a hipster.

28:08.826 --> 28:10.347
Two guys out front

28:10.391 --> 28:12.391
both recognize
Kutzler's photo.

28:12.434 --> 28:13.391
They said he's a regular.

28:13.434 --> 28:15.478
Let me ask you, Doormat,

28:15.521 --> 28:17.695
have you and your
nonprescription glasses

28:17.739 --> 28:19.086
seen this guy?

28:20.130 --> 28:22.260
Uh... sure.
I know the face.

28:22.304 --> 28:24.391
He attends
our nightly 9:30 meeting.

28:24.434 --> 28:25.869
Meeting for what?

28:25.913 --> 28:27.260
Addictions
Anonymous.

28:27.304 --> 28:30.130
I haven't seen him
since Sunday night, though.

28:30.173 --> 28:32.391
He was pretty heated
when he left.

28:32.434 --> 28:34.086
Define "heated."

28:34.130 --> 28:36.304
Uh, I saw him
out in the parking lot

28:36.347 --> 28:37.869
with some guy from his group.

28:37.913 --> 28:40.478
They were... yelling about
something-- I don't know, I...

28:40.521 --> 28:42.043
I try to mind
my own business.

28:42.086 --> 28:43.391
This other guy have a name?

28:43.434 --> 28:45.304
Well, we're not exactly
following each other's

28:45.347 --> 28:47.043
Instagram accounts
around here.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.043
It's Addictions Anonymous.

28:51.086 --> 28:53.217
[phone ringing]Excuse me.

28:54.391 --> 28:55.565
Doesn't make any sense.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.956
Kutzler wasn't an addict.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.260
Why would he attend
these meetings?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.043
And why would he
be carrying around

29:00.086 --> 29:01.434
a stash of illegal narcotics?

29:01.478 --> 29:03.043
He's pulling a Badger.

29:03.086 --> 29:05.347
He's selling narcotics
to recovering addicts.

29:05.391 --> 29:06.869
It's like shooting fish

29:06.913 --> 29:08.130
in a barrel.

29:08.173 --> 29:10.086
Except this time
the fish shot back.

29:10.130 --> 29:11.695
Maybe the one Kutzler
was arguing with.

29:11.739 --> 29:14.695
We could ask Mat to call us
if our mystery man comes back.

29:14.739 --> 29:16.478
You want to be the one
to tell Gibbs we got nothing?

29:16.521 --> 29:18.043
All right. Good point.

29:18.086 --> 29:21.130
Well, you know
what this means.

29:21.173 --> 29:23.000
Stakeout.

29:26.695 --> 29:29.739
It's a no-strings-attached
cup of coffee, Jethro.

29:29.782 --> 29:31.260
I got it
at the diner,

29:31.304 --> 29:32.782
so take it.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.304
Is that better?

29:42.260 --> 29:43.304
[grunts softly]

29:43.347 --> 29:44.391
No.

29:45.434 --> 29:48.347
Well, this might help.

29:48.391 --> 29:50.565
Davis Riley was
telling the truth.

29:50.608 --> 29:54.826
Kutzler wassubmitted for
the Medal of Honor back in 2012.

29:54.869 --> 29:57.391
And his packet didn't just
slip through the cracks.

29:57.434 --> 29:59.260
Someone buried it.Mm-hmm.

29:59.304 --> 30:02.086
So I did some digging...

30:02.130 --> 30:05.086
and I found a familiar name.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.478
You're not seriously accusing me
of having something to do

30:09.521 --> 30:11.478
with Lieutenant Kutzler's death?

30:11.521 --> 30:13.130
No, no.

30:13.173 --> 30:16.043
We checked your alibi,
and it's rock solid.

30:16.086 --> 30:18.652
Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.
Am I free to go now?

30:18.695 --> 30:20.086
No.

30:20.130 --> 30:22.521
You're not free to go.
Sit down.

30:22.565 --> 30:26.043
I'd watch your tone,
Agent Gibbs.

30:26.086 --> 30:28.043
I don't think SECNAV
would appreciate

30:28.086 --> 30:30.956
NCIS treating an admiral
like a criminal.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.782
Oh, we already talked to SECNAV.Mm-hmm.

30:33.826 --> 30:35.217
How did she phrase it?

30:35.260 --> 30:38.521
Uh, "nail the
son of a bitch."

30:41.173 --> 30:42.478
[sighs]

30:42.521 --> 30:44.173
For what?

30:44.217 --> 30:46.000
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's

30:46.043 --> 30:48.565
firstMedal of Honor
nomination.

30:48.608 --> 30:51.869
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:53.478 --> 30:54.913
[sighs]

30:54.956 --> 30:57.695
The packet was routed
through your chain of command

30:57.739 --> 30:59.521
in 2012, Admiral.

30:59.565 --> 31:02.086
Then it must have got lost
in the shuffle

31:02.130 --> 31:04.000
before it reached my desk.

31:04.043 --> 31:05.173
Because it never did.

31:05.217 --> 31:06.652
And I assure you,

31:06.695 --> 31:08.000
I will look into it.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.869
Oh, no, we already did.

31:09.913 --> 31:11.130
Yeah, we
put in a call

31:11.173 --> 31:13.000
to the U.S. forces
in Afghanistan,

31:13.043 --> 31:16.173
spoke to the yeoman who
was assigned to your desk,

31:16.217 --> 31:19.304
who cataloged all your
incoming routing sheets.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.956
And yes, here it is.
"Subject:

31:22.000 --> 31:23.652
"Medal of Honor awards packet

31:23.695 --> 31:26.347
"for one Lieutenant
Eric James Kutzler.

31:26.391 --> 31:29.043
Delivered to the office
of Admiral Xavier Meade."

31:29.086 --> 31:32.782
November 1, 2012.

31:32.826 --> 31:34.130
GIBBS:
Easy enough

31:34.173 --> 31:36.565
to make that disappear--
no one was tracking it.

31:36.608 --> 31:39.565
Oh, yeah, but then Senator
Gundersen comes along
with hernomination.

31:39.608 --> 31:42.478
I mean, you couldn't
very well bury it again.

31:42.521 --> 31:45.913
Not with so many
political eyes on it.

31:45.956 --> 31:49.739
You sandbagged your own officer
because he was gay.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.173
Kutzler's not
the only homosexual

31:51.217 --> 31:53.130
I've had in my command.

31:53.173 --> 31:56.043
My sailors' personal lives
are their own business.

31:56.086 --> 31:57.347
All I care about

31:57.391 --> 31:59.000
is that they do their jobs.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.565
Yeah, a job you made sure
they don't succeed at.

32:01.608 --> 32:05.000
Since 2011, you've given
subpar FITREP scores

32:05.043 --> 32:07.304
to every openly gay sailor

32:07.347 --> 32:09.478
who's served under you.

32:09.521 --> 32:13.217
Do you feel the walls
closing in yet?

32:13.260 --> 32:15.086
GIBBS:
You lied under oath.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.217
You tampered

32:16.260 --> 32:18.695
with official
government documents.

32:18.739 --> 32:22.391
You interfered
with a criminal investigation.

32:22.434 --> 32:25.521
I'm not saying another word.
I want a lawyer.

32:25.565 --> 32:27.086
Yep.

32:27.130 --> 32:30.478
A leader looks after his men.

32:30.521 --> 32:32.478
Fights for 'em.

32:32.521 --> 32:35.304
That's who
Lieutenant Kutzler was.

32:36.608 --> 32:39.173
You're a disgrace
to that uniform.

32:39.217 --> 32:43.000
And I look forward to testifying
at your court-martial.

32:45.521 --> 32:47.043
[door closes]

32:47.086 --> 32:49.043
[camera shutter clicking]

32:49.086 --> 32:52.260
That's yellow jacket's
fifth cigarette.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.043
I can't take it much more.

32:54.086 --> 32:55.173
[chuckles]

32:55.217 --> 32:57.304
You should see
McGee's pipe collection.

32:57.347 --> 33:00.000
I only use those
for creative purposes.

33:06.043 --> 33:08.043
Is that... Davis Riley?

33:08.086 --> 33:11.043
McGEE:
Sure is.
Guess Riley forgot to mention

33:11.086 --> 33:14.043
him and Kutzler attended the
same Addicts Anonymous meetings.

33:14.086 --> 33:15.869
Guy's got more secrets
than a slumber party.

33:15.913 --> 33:17.869
All right, McGee,
it's time for an intervention.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.043
Keep clicking,
probie.

33:19.086 --> 33:21.043
Don't eat all
the cookies.

33:23.173 --> 33:25.173
[yawns]

33:27.086 --> 33:29.043
Hey, Riley. Remember me?

33:29.086 --> 33:30.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:30.782 --> 33:32.956
Your backpack.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Mind if I take
a look inside?I think that was a yes.

33:37.217 --> 33:39.173
What do you know?
Looks like you're gonna be

33:39.217 --> 33:42.217
spending the night
at Chateau NCIS. Let's go.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.043
Oh, I don't feel so good.

33:44.086 --> 33:46.304
[sighs]
Here we go again.
McGee, back up.

33:46.347 --> 33:47.434
[groans]

33:49.478 --> 33:51.608
Tony, I don't think
he's breathing.

33:51.652 --> 33:53.130
Bishop, call 911!

34:17.391 --> 34:19.652
[door opens]

34:28.260 --> 34:30.869
Riley's in stable condition,

34:30.913 --> 34:33.217
and McGee's standing by
at the hospital.

34:33.260 --> 34:36.000
Yeah. Already knew that.

34:38.043 --> 34:41.782
Heard you were back
building boats.

34:41.826 --> 34:45.000
What are you gonna name
this one?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.782
I'm not leaving, Jethro.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.000
Not until you talk to me.

34:52.043 --> 34:54.565
Talk about what?

34:54.608 --> 34:56.217
You. Your least
favorite topic.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.913
No, I'm-I'm doing fine.Don't tell me you're fine.

34:58.956 --> 35:01.217
I know you're not.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.000
Hollis,

35:04.043 --> 35:07.173
it's late. Go home.

35:07.217 --> 35:09.826
It's your fault Diane's dead.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.869
That's what you're thinking.

35:17.652 --> 35:19.869
I'm not wrong.

35:19.913 --> 35:21.043
You didn't pull the trigger.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.173
I put her in the crosshairs.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.043
He wanted to make it personal!

35:28.913 --> 35:30.695
Still does.

35:34.086 --> 35:36.000
I'm figuring it out.

35:37.826 --> 35:41.782
But you being around me
makes you a target.

35:41.826 --> 35:44.826
So that's why
you're shutting me out?

35:44.869 --> 35:46.130
To protect me?I don't need you mixed up
in this.

35:46.173 --> 35:47.869
I don't need you mixed up in me!

35:47.913 --> 35:49.347
It's not your call.

35:49.391 --> 35:51.608
I'll take my chances.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.869
I can handle myself.

35:55.913 --> 35:57.434
Hmm?

35:57.478 --> 35:59.565
Copy that.

36:00.956 --> 36:02.956
[grunting]

36:14.956 --> 36:15.913
No,
I'm not

36:15.956 --> 36:18.000
letting you off that easy.

36:18.043 --> 36:20.652
[sighs]

36:22.521 --> 36:25.565
After the ambush,

36:25.608 --> 36:28.956
people kept telling me
how lucky I was to be alive.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.391
The truth is, death
would have been so much easier.

36:34.956 --> 36:36.913
Instead,

36:36.956 --> 36:39.217
I relive
that awful day

36:39.260 --> 36:41.260
every
single day.

36:43.260 --> 36:48.086
I see my friends die
again and again.

36:48.130 --> 36:51.130
And that damn grenade...

36:52.913 --> 36:55.826
I just stood
there, frozen,

36:55.869 --> 36:59.130
while Kutzler threw himself
over it.

36:59.173 --> 37:02.913
I can still hear the
sound as it went off

37:02.956 --> 37:05.956
and the damage
that it did to him.

37:07.956 --> 37:11.695
I can't get that image
out of my head.

37:11.739 --> 37:15.304
That's why you started using?

37:15.347 --> 37:17.869
I just wanted to forget.

37:18.913 --> 37:21.434
How was Kutzler involved?

37:21.478 --> 37:24.434
He... saw how
bad it got

37:24.478 --> 37:26.130
and stepped in.

37:27.173 --> 37:29.739
He got me in the program,

37:29.782 --> 37:33.130
went with me to meetings.

37:33.173 --> 37:35.565
He saved my life
a second time.

37:35.608 --> 37:37.869
When did you relapse?

37:37.913 --> 37:40.521
Three days ago.

37:40.565 --> 37:41.869
When I didn't show up
to the group session,

37:41.913 --> 37:43.782
Kutzler came to my apartment,

37:43.826 --> 37:46.086
and, uh...

37:46.130 --> 37:48.695
he saw that I was high.

37:48.739 --> 37:52.739
All I really remember
is that he was angry.

37:52.782 --> 37:56.086
He took my stash
and stormed out.

37:56.130 --> 37:58.782
GPS puts him at the community
center later that night.

37:58.826 --> 38:00.695
Why'd he go back?

38:01.739 --> 38:03.739
[sighs]

38:05.173 --> 38:08.043
I must have told him
who I got the drugs from.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.913
Eric probably went
there to confront him.

38:09.956 --> 38:11.652
Who's that?

38:11.695 --> 38:14.695
The guy at the front desk.

38:15.695 --> 38:18.478
Mat Jebson.

38:21.086 --> 38:23.043
[keys jangling]

38:26.956 --> 38:28.739
TONY: [chuckles]
You're not serious.

38:28.782 --> 38:31.869
BISHOP:
I'm totally serious. I swear.
Hey, Mat.

38:33.086 --> 38:34.695
Mat, what's up, man?
Hey, uh,

38:34.739 --> 38:36.608
Bishop was just telling me
this story.

38:36.652 --> 38:38.478
It is hilarious,
and you're gonna get

38:38.521 --> 38:40.043
a kick out of it.
Tell him.
So,

38:40.086 --> 38:41.652
Agent McGee and I were searching
your apartment,

38:41.695 --> 38:43.521
and we found
your makeshift drug lab,

38:43.565 --> 38:46.130
along with hundreds of vials
of morphine and fentanyl,

38:46.173 --> 38:48.826
just... like this.

38:48.869 --> 38:51.739
TONY:
Hilarious, right? So here's
what we think happened.

38:51.782 --> 38:53.956
Riley spills the beans
about you selling drugs

38:54.000 --> 38:55.347
to addicts at the center.

38:55.391 --> 38:57.695
Kutzler threatens
to turn you in,

38:57.739 --> 38:59.956
so you follow him home
and put three rounds in him.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.173
Am I right?

39:02.782 --> 39:05.608
You made money exploiting people
who needed help.

39:07.521 --> 39:09.043
Looking for this?

39:09.086 --> 39:10.304
BISHOP:
Already searched
your trunk.

39:10.347 --> 39:12.173
Found a .22
with a silencer.

39:12.217 --> 39:15.130
Hey, isn't that the same weapon
used to kill Lieutenant Kutzler?

39:15.173 --> 39:16.956
Yes, it certainly is.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.086
Spoiler alert,
Heisenberg,

39:19.130 --> 39:21.304
it doesn't end well for you.

39:25.043 --> 39:28.652
I want to apologize
for what I said the other day.

39:28.695 --> 39:30.652
I was out of line.

39:30.695 --> 39:33.217
Eric's name was cleared, his
killer brought to justice.

39:33.260 --> 39:34.652
That's all
that matters.

39:34.695 --> 39:36.913
His, um, Medal of Honor
nomination would have never

39:36.956 --> 39:39.304
been endorsed without your help,
Agent Gibbs.

39:39.347 --> 39:42.434
Thank you, sincerely.

39:42.478 --> 39:44.086
When's it official?

39:44.130 --> 39:47.478
The White House should be making
an announcement in a few days.

39:47.521 --> 39:49.521
A hero finally
gets his due.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.304
You know, Eric never
saw himself as a hero.

39:54.347 --> 39:56.913
He would often come here
to remember his men,

39:56.956 --> 39:59.739
the ones
he couldn't save.

39:59.782 --> 40:03.695
Said it was his duty
to never forget their sacrifice.

40:03.739 --> 40:08.173
That's how he chose
to honor them.

40:08.217 --> 40:10.608
I'll have to find a way
to do the same for him.

40:10.652 --> 40:14.043
Continue his legacy.

40:14.086 --> 40:18.347
Your husband died doing the same
thing he did in Afghanistan,

40:18.391 --> 40:22.130
fighting to save
a friend's life.

40:22.173 --> 40:24.739
He wouldn't leave a man behind.

40:26.826 --> 40:30.304
Finish the mission.

40:47.434 --> 40:49.434
[elevator bell dings]

40:50.434 --> 40:52.391
Did you hear anything?

40:52.434 --> 40:56.000
âª Lift up your head,
let it all start âª

40:56.043 --> 40:58.130
You guys.

40:58.173 --> 41:00.478
What? What? What? What?What? What? What?

41:00.521 --> 41:03.913
âª Today is the day
you return to your heart âª

41:03.956 --> 41:06.217
[chuckles]

41:06.260 --> 41:08.434
Yay.

41:08.478 --> 41:10.434
[chuckles]

41:10.478 --> 41:12.608
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

41:12.652 --> 41:14.782
Eric should have just
let me die in Afghanistan.

41:14.826 --> 41:16.521
That's not
who he was.

41:16.565 --> 41:18.695
And I'm not
that way either.

41:18.739 --> 41:22.695
Why would you want to help me?
He's dead because of me.

41:22.739 --> 41:25.956
I'm not worth saving.Eric thought you were.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.565
And, hey, it's not
gonna be easy, but...

41:28.608 --> 41:30.695
you won't go
through this alone.

41:34.086 --> 41:36.347
Oh, she's perfect.

41:36.391 --> 41:37.956
A chip
off the old block.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.043
Has that
new baby smell.

41:40.086 --> 41:42.565
Congratulations, you guys.

41:42.608 --> 41:45.478
And what is
this fair beauty's name?

41:47.652 --> 41:50.434
She's sort of named after you,
Doctor.

41:50.478 --> 41:52.478
I beg your pardon?

41:53.869 --> 41:57.173
Say hello
to Victoria Elizabeth Palmer.

41:58.652 --> 42:01.521
Mother... would be thrilled.

42:01.565 --> 42:03.521
[chuckling]:
As I am.

42:03.565 --> 42:05.130
Jimmy, what happened
to your hand?

42:05.173 --> 42:07.478
Oh. Funny story. Uh,

42:07.521 --> 42:10.304
did you know
that epidurals don't work

42:10.347 --> 42:11.913
on five percent of patients?

42:11.956 --> 42:13.304
I sure didn't.

42:13.347 --> 42:15.478
I had to improvise
with my pain management.

42:15.521 --> 42:17.130
You broke his finger?

42:17.173 --> 42:18.086
JIMMY:
She sure did.

42:18.130 --> 42:19.260
Two, actually.

42:20.173 --> 42:22.043
But it was worth it.

42:22.086 --> 42:24.521
Spoken like a true parent.

42:24.565 --> 42:29.478
âª I will never let you go

42:30.782 --> 42:35.043
âª We're going home

42:41.521 --> 42:45.000
âª We're going home.

42:49.391 --> 42:52.391
