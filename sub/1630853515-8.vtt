God, I've missed you so much.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.108
-Eamonn:
You're here. You're here.
-Yeah.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.486
-I saw your bags when
I came back from the studio.
-Yeah, I had them dropped off.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.738
I was late for rehearsal.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.615
-They wouldn't let me leave.
-Ugh.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.950
I had to do the,
um, fire scene.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.245
Fire scene in space?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.789
We get hit by an asteroid

03:26.873 --> 03:28.750
and the circuit blows,

03:28.833 --> 03:30.627
(grunts)
then the spaceship
sets on fire

03:30.710 --> 03:32.503
and it starts
spinning faster

03:32.587 --> 03:35.256
and faster and faster

03:35.340 --> 03:37.884
and enter another
dimension...

03:41.596 --> 03:45.892
This green screen stuff,
it is so fucking tedious,

03:45.975 --> 03:47.936
-but I was thinking
about you the whole time.
-Lianna: That was why

03:48.019 --> 03:50.021
you crashed into
that asteroid.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.439
Must be careful.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.107
I wanted to see you
in your space suit.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.525
I could've come to set.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.527
It's done,
the rehearsal, for ages.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.237
Eamonn:
When did we last
see each other?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.990
Lianna:
Four weeks ago
in Reykjavík.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.617
That's way too long.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.371
From now on, like,
two weeks, tops.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.289
Unless something
incredibly important
comes up

04:08.373 --> 04:09.916
-and then we'll leave.
-(laughing)

04:09.999 --> 04:11.668
And then I will say,
"Bye-bye."

04:11.751 --> 04:13.336
Obviously.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.255
I kind of like
that we have to start
from scratch every time.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.592
Fun!
Wait, who are you?
What's your name?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.302
Hey, at least it's not boring.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.762
I mean, I have
no problem with boring.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.181
I long for a boring life.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.060
-(grunts)
-Eamonn: How was the show?

04:29.143 --> 04:33.022
Great.
It's just the usual sea
of rabid 11-year-olds.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.983
Eamonn:
Sounds amazing.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.150
I'd give anything
to cross over

04:36.234 --> 04:37.485
into a more
mature audience.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.945
Mature audiences
fall asleep on the couch

04:39.028 --> 04:40.822
watching Netflix.

04:40.905 --> 04:41.990
Boom.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.492
-Is that what you want?
-(laughs)

04:44.575 --> 04:48.037
-Yeah, my ego does.
-Yeah, but the little
kiddies love you.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.790
-They go ape-shit for you.
-I'm 31 years old.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.917
-That is not good.
-Stop whining.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.627
The album's amazing.
It got amazing reviews.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.047
It's a "New York Times"
Critic's Pick. It's done.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.008
-Will you marry me?
-(laughing)

05:00.091 --> 05:02.969
I, um, I wish
people bought it.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.220
Didn't sell,
it didn't translate.

05:04.303 --> 05:05.930
Kids are bored by it,
and...

05:06.014 --> 05:07.724
I just don't interest adults.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.643
I think, maybe...
you're being in danger

05:10.727 --> 05:12.228
of being unfair on your fans.

05:12.311 --> 05:14.188
-I love my fans.
-(Eamonn laughs)

05:14.272 --> 05:17.066
I fucking love them, okay?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.986
It's just the shows.
They, they have
this weird vibe.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.363
Like,
half of the audience
wants to be there

05:22.447 --> 05:24.907
and they're screaming
like I'm a K-pop star.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.910
I don't even think
they can hear the music,
they're so loud.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.203
And the other half
are their parents,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.872
or even worse,
their poor grandparents,

05:30.955 --> 05:32.707
and would probably rather die

05:32.790 --> 05:35.043
-than listen to my music.
-Eamonn: They probably will die

05:35.126 --> 05:36.836
which is why you should stick
with the 11-year-olds.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.421
That's where the money is.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.882
At least you know
what matters, baby.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.722
(grunts, sighs)

05:51.517 --> 05:53.519
I heard Mira was in town.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.606
Yeah. She's doing
some random series.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.900
I don't know what it is.
She told me, but I forgot.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.736
Do you... see a lot of her?

06:01.819 --> 06:03.362
No, we had a drink once.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.947
She used me
as her therapist.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.532
Lianna:
Why didn't you tell
me you saw her?

06:06.616 --> 06:07.784
I'm not jealous.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.910
Why would you be jealous?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.369
Because she's beautiful
and successful,

06:10.453 --> 06:13.414
and you were... very much
in love with her.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.334
You're the most beautiful
girl in the world,
and that was two years ago.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.003
Lianna:
It's nothing. Nothing.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.463
Two years?
Are you serious?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.090
I mean, think about it,
that's only four weeks

06:22.173 --> 06:23.758
times 12 times two.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.094
Dude, where is this going?

06:26.177 --> 06:28.304
Lianna:
I don't know, I--
Nowhere. I just--

06:28.387 --> 06:31.140
You're in Paris,
you're bored, alone,

06:31.224 --> 06:33.434
-maybe you need
a little comforting.
-What?

06:34.727 --> 06:37.480
Bubba,
I spend my days
in a space suit

06:37.563 --> 06:39.607
hanging from wires
staring at green screens.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.610
When I get home,
I fall asleep in the bathtub.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.113
-Watching Netflix?
-Yeah.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.281
-Masturbating?
-Yes.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.574
Lianna:
So, she reached
out to you?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.576
Mm-hm.
She called. We spoke.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.954
She's not a part
of my life.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.456
I think if I'm honest,
I would happier
if she was okay,

06:55.540 --> 06:57.041
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.920
It's like, we have everything.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.463
Lianna:
You don't have any
feelings for her?

07:02.547 --> 07:05.299
-Anymore? At all?
-Eamonn: No.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.011

Zelda:
I know you do.
We both do.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.979
Yeah, but he makes,

but no one
is allowed to read it.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.622
You haven't read it?

09:41.706 --> 09:43.582

it's going to sweep

-Zelda: Hey, Jasmine.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.226
Don't worry,
I'm in a good mood today.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.687
Any actress
would kill for this part.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.689
I myself would kill
for this part.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.359
You do not know how excited
I am about this for you.

10:11.152 --> 10:11.986

10:12.069 --> 10:13.446
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.198
Just... give me a minute.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.004
(clears throat)

10:30.087 --> 10:33.758
So, I will go straight
from "The Vampires"...

10:33.841 --> 10:35.009
to whatever it's called?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.344
(softly)
"Kingdom Come,"

10:36.427 --> 10:37.845
but you did not
hear that from me.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.139
"Kingdom Come"!
Is it adapted from the novel?!

10:40.222 --> 10:41.223
Which novel?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.558
Mira:
What do you mean
which novel?

10:42.641 --> 10:44.352
Sorry, I didn't hear.
A, a novel?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.854
It was a huge bestseller.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.356
-I loved it.
-Oh, looks fascinating.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.608
Uh, yeah, it's
an amazing part.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.152
Uh, what's her name, uh?

10:53.235 --> 10:54.862
M-Meredith?

10:54.945 --> 10:58.282
Yeah, that's it.
Meredith something.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
Zelda: Whatever.
You're his first choice.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.120
He hasn't considered
any other actresses.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.374
And now, he wants
to meet you in person.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.541
Where does he live again?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.753
Shetland Islands,
but he can meet in London.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.090
Only problem: he is, uh,
notoriously claustrophobic.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.677
Okay.
So, uh, what do
we do about that?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.346
He's okay to meet
in Kensington Gardens,

11:20.429 --> 11:22.932
and he will bring
chocolate milk and cookies.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.642
Chocolate milk and cookies?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.268
Zelda:
Yes, it's a well-known fact.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.521
He likes chocolate milk
and cookies.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.855
Right.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.316
I could meet him
the day after tomorrow
in the morning.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.734
We're shooting
nights this week.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.945
Zelda: Let me confirm
and come back to you, okay?

11:36.028 --> 11:36.987
Okay, great.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.412
(phone ringing)

11:49.291 --> 11:51.085
(chuckles)
Yes?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.546
Zelda: (on phone)
Your London trip is booked.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.214
Eurostar, cabs, everything.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.091
But not a word to Regina,

11:57.174 --> 11:59.135
the driver,
any frogs on the crew.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.304
If the press
gets wind of this,
we are dead meat.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.806
Got it.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.975
It is late in Paris
and you have
to shoot tomorrow,

12:06.058 --> 12:07.685
so I will let you sleep.

12:07.768 --> 12:08.978
-'Kay.
-Gotta go. Bye.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.146
Bye.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.942
(sighs)

12:21.657 --> 12:24.452
(speaking French)

12:57.902 --> 13:01.363
So, uh, where you from?
(laughs)

13:06.076 --> 13:09.038
-I grew up in New Jersey.
-René: Yes. Okay, uh.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.665
But I moved to Paris
when I was still a child.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.543
-So, your parents moved.
-No, not exactly.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.922
My birth parents
died in a car crash.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.258
-René: Oh, uh.
-So, I was raised by my aunt
and my grandmother.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.220
-I'm, I'm, I'm so
sorry to hear that.
-Mais tant pis.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.971
I hardly remember my parents.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.474
And... I had
a happy childhood.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.393
So, did you always
want to be an actress?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.853
I have been lucky.

13:32.937 --> 13:37.066
I had the right teacher,
met the right people...

13:37.149 --> 13:38.859
ended up in drama school.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.779
-I'm in my second year.
-Been in movies?

13:42.613 --> 13:43.405
Never.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.448
Do you want to?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.283
Well, I'm here.
(chuckles)

13:47.117 --> 13:48.911
But tr-truth is, um...

13:48.994 --> 13:51.872
-I'm sorry, I, I haven't
seen your films.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.624
D-Don't feel bad.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.543
They are not
so easy to find.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.086
Well, tell me about
Philippe's wife.

13:57.169 --> 14:01.006
Um, it's a way
people lived back then.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.758
She's a housewife.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.387
Her, her, uh, hobby
is, uh, knitting.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.598
(laughs) Knitting?
I have no idea how to knit.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.434
But behold,
behold, behold!

14:13.644 --> 14:15.521
There is a twist.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.981
What's the twist?
(laughs)

14:17.064 --> 14:20.609
I won't spoil it,
but, uh, you
will be surprised.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.488
(knocks on door)

14:25.322 --> 14:26.448
Come in.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.662
Am I, uh, disturbing you?

14:31.745 --> 14:34.498
No... No, not at all.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.917
Do you mind if we talk?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.377
Anything serious?

14:38.460 --> 14:39.378
No.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.968
Is this, uh, your costume

14:46.051 --> 14:48.178
for, uh, the scene
with the medium?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.559
You like it?

14:53.642 --> 14:56.353
-Spooky.
-Thanks.

14:58.647 --> 15:03.569
Mira, um...
I want to thank you.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.613
You brought me
back from the brink.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.115
Yeah...

15:08.198 --> 15:10.200
you had sunk pretty low.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.745
I had lost trust in myself...

15:12.828 --> 15:14.913
and, uh, in this project.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.415
You mean you
lost confidence.

15:16.498 --> 15:20.502
-Possibly.
-No genuine art
stems from confidence.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.463
You should be grateful
for the doubts.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.841
My anxieties...
are the meanest.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.427
How dare you
be so arrogant?

15:28.510 --> 15:31.555
I'm fully convinced
that my anxieties are...

15:31.639 --> 15:33.349
far worse than yours.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.729
-Have you, um, seen the set?
-No.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.981
Pretty creepy.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.275
It's filled
with evil spirits,

15:43.359 --> 15:44.652
but don't worry.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.945
I, uh, had it, uh, exorcised.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.030
Wow.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.823
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.325
I'm impressed.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.826
How'd you go about it?

15:52.910 --> 15:53.911
Hire a psychic?

15:53.994 --> 15:56.372
Oh, um, technically,
each, uh, Diocese, uh,

15:56.455 --> 16:00.209
has, uh, their own
designated exorcists,

16:00.292 --> 16:01.377
but they are only summoned

16:01.460 --> 16:03.712
for persistent
paranormal activity.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.675
-Which I'm guessing
is not our case?
-No, no, no.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.511
It was just a,
a pre-emptive exorcism.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.845
Mm, jellybeans?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.222
Oh, thanks.

16:15.974 --> 16:18.394
So, the, the priest
came on his own

16:18.477 --> 16:21.897
and he examined
the set very thoroughly.

16:21.980 --> 16:25.275
He burned some incense,
and he said a few prayers.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.821
-Amazing.
-And he gave it his blessing.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.699
-I'm so relieved.
-I knew you would be.

Close your eyes.

Listen only to my voice.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.992
You cannot resist.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.037
You are mine.
Listen only to my voice.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.625
You want to obey.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.555
At 2:00 this morning,

18:59.638 --> 19:03.559
you will open the door
of Philippe Guérande's
apartment.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.186
You will open it
for The Vampires.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.859
Who will you be
opening it for?

19:11.942 --> 19:14.444
For The Vampires.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.822
I will obey.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.700
I'll do your will.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.952
Now wake up.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.954
You've forgotten
everything.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.622
(gasps)

19:28.292 --> 19:29.585
What happened?

19:30.627 --> 19:31.628
Did you make contact

19:31.712 --> 19:34.214
with the spirit
of your husband?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.424
Maybe.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.634
It was like a dream.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.469
Everything's fuzzy.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.277
(indistinct chatter)

20:03.160 --> 20:05.787
You have a late call tomorrow
and there's this party tonight.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.747
Could be fun.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.916
-With the crew?
-Mm.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.627
More like with girls.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.128
You asking me out?

20:13.211 --> 20:14.421
I won't stay late.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.131
Feel like coming?

20:16.214 --> 20:18.467
-No, I don't think so.
-(groans)

20:18.550 --> 20:19.468
(chuckles)

20:19.551 --> 20:20.844
It's very low-key.

20:20.928 --> 20:21.929
It's not the kind of crowd

20:22.012 --> 20:24.097
that's gonna make
a big deal about

20:24.181 --> 20:27.142
-who you are.
-I wasn't worried.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.811
Oh! Couch, quick.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.939
You seem fond of this place.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.857
You remember
the last time
we were here?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.318
Zoe:
I do remember.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.988
You danced to this
cheesy, old pop song.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.783
How can you call
"99 Luftballons" cheesy?

20:42.866 --> 20:44.451
It's genius.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.620
I felt you were dancing
for me that night.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.413
-Ah.
-Were you?

20:48.497 --> 20:51.625
I was four drinks in,
I think. (chuckles)

20:51.708 --> 20:53.835
Is that an easy way out?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.298
If I don't wanna
hurt you, yes.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.633
I get it.

20:59.716 --> 21:00.968
I don't think you do.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.974
Hey, I, uh...
I like you Zoe.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.017
I mean, I...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.854
-I care about you.
-I do, too.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.983
I was in love with Laurie.

21:18.318 --> 21:23.532
And I guess, in a way,
I... I still am.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.326
-I was hoping I could help.
-You do.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.369
It's just, um,

21:27.452 --> 21:30.497
I'm desperately
attracted to Laurie...

21:30.580 --> 21:32.666
even when she's
being horrible to me.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.626
Maybe I'm even more...

21:34.710 --> 21:37.462
attracted to her when
she's horrible to me,

21:37.546 --> 21:38.463
but...

21:41.425 --> 21:43.844
(scoffs)
I don't even think
I'm into girls.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.389
You are.
No, you are.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.224
-No, I--
-You just suppress it.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.810
No. I don't think so.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.106
With other girls,
I've just tried to recreate

21:56.189 --> 21:58.483
what I had with Laurie.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.029
Don't think she's
even that much
into girls either.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.656
She dumped you
for a basic douche.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.033
You're so wrong.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.493
Laurie...
she's into snatch,

22:08.577 --> 22:11.705
but, where there's gold...

22:12.748 --> 22:14.124
Laurie digs.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.543
Will you dance for me?

22:18.962 --> 22:22.174
-If you do me a favor.
-What type of favor?

22:23.675 --> 22:26.595
-Can you give me a ride?
-Where to?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.597
-Eurostar.
-What?

22:28.680 --> 22:32.142
-(laughing)
-I-I'm off to London.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.019
I, I have a--
Like a--

22:34.102 --> 22:36.229
an important meeting
there in the morning.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.066
And I'll be back
before we start tomorrow.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.233
Mm.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.612
Dance.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.282
-Is that a yes?
-That's a yes.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.075
-You play Philippe's wife?
-I do.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.661
And you're
Regina Moritz,
Mira's assistant.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.829
I am.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.248
Such a fan of hers.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.750
It's kind of intimidating.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.502
No, she's really easygoing.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.213
There's talk on the set.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.590
You're leaving Mira
and directing a feature.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.383
Regina:
Yeah, shooting in the U.K.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.259
Do you want coffee?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.094
-Sure.
-Let's go.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.764
I've seen your shorts.
They're so powerful.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.432
That's very kind of you.

25:17.515 --> 25:20.268
Can I ask what
your film is about?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.231
If you can't say,
it's, it's cool.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.525
-Yeah, but it's kind of
funny you would ask.
-Why is that?

25:27.609 --> 25:30.195
'Cause you're the first.
Not even Mira.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.488
Everyone's thrilled
I'm moving on,

25:31.571 --> 25:33.907
but no one really
cares where.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.619
-Is Mira in it?
-No.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.372
Whole cast is
pretty young, late teens.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.082
Mostly unknowns.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.252
-Small budget?
-More like no budget.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.586
But that's
fine by me, honestly.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.797
That's the way
it should be done.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.468
Well,
the main character
is a young girl.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.137
There's a brutal
civil war on her planet,

25:56.221 --> 25:57.931
and to protect her,

25:58.014 --> 26:00.600
her parents fly her
to Earth on a spaceship,

26:00.684 --> 26:02.394
promising they'll come back,

26:02.477 --> 26:05.146
but she waits and waits
and they don't come back,

26:05.230 --> 26:06.815
so... she has
to learn on her own

26:06.898 --> 26:09.109
how to survive
in this strange world.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.945
I love it.

26:12.028 --> 26:14.447
-But it-it's a sad story.
-I mean, she adapts,

26:14.531 --> 26:17.617
and... finds some sort
of happiness on Earth.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.620
Still. It-it's sad.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.249
And it's, it's scarily
similar to my own story.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.417
Similar?

26:26.334 --> 26:28.336
My parents were American.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.963
-Hm.
-They died.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.507
They left me on my own.

26:32.590 --> 26:36.219
I was adopted myself,
and movies were a refuge.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.222

26:40.598 --> 26:42.183
I'm usually too
embarrassed to ask

26:42.267 --> 26:45.979
but I-I'd, I'd really
love to be involved.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.981
If I could attend
the shoot,

26:48.064 --> 26:49.482
even for a few days.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.652
Are you sure?
We-- There's hardly
any money involved.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.196
It doesn't matter.
I don't see it as a job.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.074
I mean,
I'll think about it.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.747
Why would you say that?

34:42.830 --> 34:47.210
I imagined you would be,
um... Jade's surrogate.

34:47.293 --> 34:51.088
But you have Mira.
She's the surrogate.

34:51.172 --> 34:55.468
I wanted you to be
the spirit of Jade...

34:55.551 --> 34:57.261
haunting the film.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.434
But Lily Flower
is no Irma Vep.

35:03.518 --> 35:07.480
And Cynthia Keng
is no Jade Lee,

35:07.563 --> 35:09.440
which is fine by me.

35:09.524 --> 35:13.402
-And I still had fun.

And also,
you shouldn't worry.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.826

35:46.894 --> 35:48.229
in Hong Kong?

35:48.312 --> 35:51.482

a recluse nowadays.

-Yeah, yeah.

-Oh.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.355

-Especially in LA.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.900

news travels fast.
-I see.

-Do you mind if I sit?
-Of course not.

40:10.533 --> 40:15.371

the meeting...
-Mm-hm.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.125
was great.
(chuckles)

40:22.753 --> 40:25.214

-So unassuming.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.133
I never met him myself,

40:27.216 --> 40:30.469
but, uh...
so I've heard.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.971
Mm.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.973
D-Do you mind if--

40:35.349 --> 40:37.434
Shh. (laughs)

40:41.814 --> 40:42.898

40:44.066 --> 40:45.651

Meredith in, uh,

40:45.734 --> 40:47.319

40:47.403 --> 40:49.155

40:51.574 --> 40:53.159
I have you to thank.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.327
Why?

40:55.411 --> 40:57.496
It's such an obvious
bit of casting.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.207
I wouldn't have
been ready for it.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.210
That's very kind, but--

41:03.294 --> 41:05.838
-No, it's very kind,
but I don't agree.
-Don't.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.173
I don't agree.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.716
Doesn't matter, it's true.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.635
Or let's say
that Irma Vep...

41:11.719 --> 41:12.928
she taught me.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.264
Sounds more like it.

41:15.347 --> 41:18.267
She reconciled me
with acting.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.769
You know,
I, I was angry.

41:20.853 --> 41:24.648
I was, like, really
angry with acting.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.193
The pleasure was gone.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.153
How did she do that?

41:29.236 --> 41:30.863
Mira: By showing me

41:30.946 --> 41:35.367
that acting...
is more... than acting.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.786
But, uh, you always
knew that, didn't you?

41:37.870 --> 41:40.789
Yeah, but I think I was
a bit afraid of it.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.584
You...

41:45.085 --> 41:47.087
You were afraid
of the spirits.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.131
Possibly.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.301
But spirits are good
if you welcome them.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.303
And to act, you have
to welcome them.

41:54.386 --> 41:56.805
Yes. (laughs)

41:56.889 --> 41:58.390
But the other...

41:58.474 --> 42:00.100
day, I felt...

42:00.184 --> 42:03.312
like I was losing
the spirit of Irma Vep.

42:03.395 --> 42:05.898
Of course.
That's the way.

42:05.981 --> 42:09.026
That's the way?
W-Why do you say that?

42:09.109 --> 42:10.903
She will only inhabit you

42:10.986 --> 42:14.865
while you embody her
in our film.

42:14.949 --> 42:17.910
But, um, when
your thoughts move away,

42:17.993 --> 42:20.788
when, uh, your fate

42:20.871 --> 42:22.581
takes you elsewhere,

42:22.665 --> 42:24.250
she will look
for another vessel.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.044
You mean, she,
she doesn't need me anymore?

42:27.127 --> 42:30.130
Or you could also
turn it around

42:30.214 --> 42:33.342
and say you don't
need her anymore.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.303
Because, uh...

42:37.388 --> 42:39.223
you will meet, uh...

42:39.306 --> 42:40.891
other spirits.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.184
Like Meredith.

42:42.268 --> 42:46.981
Meredith, eh, is,
uh, another breed.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.024
She has nothing
to do with darkness.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.486
-But everything
to do with the light.
-She does.

42:52.569 --> 42:54.446
You will embrace her.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.031
But heed her.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.199
