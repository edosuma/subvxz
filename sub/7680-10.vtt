MacGYVER:
Now, this is what goin'
to the beach is all about.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.595
(women shouting)

00:32.098 --> 00:36.102
Boy, there's some
fine-lookin' women
out there, huh?

00:36.603 --> 00:37.604
You got those binoculars?

00:37.604 --> 00:39.606
Yeah, in the kitchen.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.112
MacGYVER:
On the other hand,

00:46.112 --> 00:47.614
rescuin' a lady general

00:47.614 --> 00:49.616
has never been
my idea of beach fun.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.621
(doorknob rattles)

01:30.156 --> 01:33.660
All right, let's see
what we've got to work with.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.171
Okay, this seems
to be a good start.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.183
All I need is a few seconds
of distraction.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.709
Oh, man,

02:22.709 --> 02:24.210
look at that!

03:39.786 --> 03:42.789
Oh, I gotta go outside
and check this out.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.301
What the...?

03:55.802 --> 03:56.803
Hey, let's go!
Come on!

03:56.803 --> 03:57.303
Who's in there?

03:58.805 --> 03:59.806
Hey!

03:59.806 --> 04:01.307
(grunting)

04:02.809 --> 04:05.311
I'll bet you didn't tell them
a thing, huh, General?

04:05.311 --> 04:06.312
Let's get you outta here.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.316
Handcuffs! Damn!

04:11.317 --> 04:13.820
(men grunting and shouting)

04:19.325 --> 04:21.327
(grunting)

04:36.843 --> 04:37.844
She's gone!

04:37.844 --> 04:38.845
(both yell)

04:42.348 --> 04:44.350
(grunting and gasping)

04:49.355 --> 04:51.357
Stay! Sit! Stay!

04:52.859 --> 04:54.360
Good dogs.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.374
Yeah, Packman? MacGyver.

05:08.374 --> 05:11.377
You know that lady general
you lost?

05:11.377 --> 05:12.378
Well, I found her.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.961
MacGYVER:
I really have
to rethink my life.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.964
I hardly get the lady general
back to the Pentagon

06:37.964 --> 06:40.466
when I get a Code Red priority.

06:44.971 --> 06:49.475
So, here I am on a moonlit
night starin' down the throat

06:49.475 --> 06:52.478
of a brand-new Middle Eastern
nuclear refining plant

06:52.478 --> 06:54.480
put on this good Earth
for no other reason

06:54.480 --> 06:55.982
than to allow
some crazy strong man

06:55.982 --> 06:57.483
to blow up his neighbors.

07:03.489 --> 07:06.993
Guess what Washington
asked me to do.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.546
All right, ready to blow it.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.548
Be at the pickup zone at 0430.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.090
All right.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.605
Home-- enough is enough.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.608
I will not,
under any circumstances

09:02.608 --> 09:05.611
for any reason whatsoever
answer the phone...

09:05.611 --> 09:08.114
probably... again.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.620
Yes, I am definitely home.

10:11.677 --> 10:12.678
Well?

10:12.678 --> 10:14.180
I just dropped in
to congratulate you.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.183
Thank you very much.

10:17.683 --> 10:21.187
The Department
is grateful.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.188
You're welcome.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.689
And I'm very tired.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.691
I'm not offering you
an assignment.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.193
I'm giving you a warning.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.694
You're a target.

10:28.694 --> 10:31.697
Now, that I'd like
spelled out.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.700
When you put away that
nuclear installation,
they ID'd you.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.202
The contract went out
the next day.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.204
They hired Axminster.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.207
He took out Sheikh Hussein,
didn't he?

10:41.207 --> 10:43.709
Right in the middle of prayers.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.711
Blew him straight to Allah

10:45.711 --> 10:47.713
and killed 37 others
along the way.

10:47.713 --> 10:51.217
You oughta get out of town while
we, uh, stake this place out.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.719
Barney, I like
to take care of my own messes.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.221
MacGyver,

10:55.221 --> 10:57.723
Axminster would torch
the whole block just to get you.

10:58.224 --> 11:02.228
Now, I can set
up a safe house,
full security,

11:02.228 --> 11:03.729
unless, uh,
you've got someplace

11:03.729 --> 11:05.731
you'd like to settle in
for a couple of weeks.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.735
You know, there
is a kind of a,

11:09.735 --> 11:13.739
a trip I've been toying with.

11:13.739 --> 11:14.740
Take it now.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.743
As long as it spells one word:
"lost."

11:17.743 --> 11:19.745
(sighs)

11:19.745 --> 11:21.747
I guess I do owe a visit.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.250
To who?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.751
It's personal, Barney.

11:25.751 --> 11:29.755
Okay, just tell me if and where.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.758
I'll handle that, Colonel,

11:33.259 --> 11:35.761
and you don't need
to know where.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.264
You just take care of Axminster.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.776
Take a look at this!

11:50.776 --> 11:53.279
What?

11:53.279 --> 11:55.781
It says this here lady
was attacked by aliens

11:55.781 --> 11:58.284
and had an alien baby.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.285
No kiddin'?

11:59.785 --> 12:03.289
Yeah. In Alabama somewhere.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.791
Big on aliens
in Alabama.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.293
No lie.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.295
Full of strange people.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.796
That's why I'm goin' North,

12:10.796 --> 12:12.798
back to see my family
for a while.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.303
Makes sense.

12:18.804 --> 12:22.808
MacGYVER:
I hadn't seen my grandfather
since I was ten.

12:22.808 --> 12:24.810
He was all the family
I had left,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.812
and we were strangers.

12:30.816 --> 12:33.319
(phone ringing)

12:37.823 --> 12:38.824
MacGYVER:
Hi. MacGyver here.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.327
When you hear the beep,
let me know what's on your mind.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.828
(beep)

12:42.828 --> 12:44.830
JACKSON:
I'll let you know
what's on my mind, bud.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.332
Pick up that phone
and talk to me.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.334
I got no mind for machines.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.836
Oh, damn,
I guess you aren't there!

12:50.836 --> 12:52.838
This is your...

12:52.838 --> 12:53.839
This is Harry Jackson.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.841
The-the clerk
from the general store

12:55.841 --> 12:58.344
brung me up a note
with this phone number.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.845
He says you're comin'
to visit me.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.347
Axminster!

13:01.347 --> 13:02.848
JACKSON:
And I just want to say...

13:03.849 --> 13:04.850
don't come.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.353
I'm busy.

13:07.353 --> 13:10.856
Ah, hell, you're probably
on the way here already.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.359
You can phone the general store
again.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.362
It's area code 303, triple-five,
double-seven-oh-two.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.365
I'll try and run
that down right away.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.391
MacGYVER:
What a beautiful part
of the world.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.893
Has everything but people.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.896
I got to wonder what happened
to my grandfather

13:50.896 --> 13:54.400
that made him decide to live
in such isolation.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.403
Actually, I wonder

13:57.403 --> 13:59.405
if he'll even be here
to meet me.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.907
WOMAN:
There he is...

14:04.910 --> 14:07.413
WOMAN:
Well, hop in.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.918
Hi, Harry.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.920
How'd you know?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.923
I never forget
a grandfather.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.926
You've grown.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.430
Well, it's been, what, six,
17, 18 years, hasn't it?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.931
I hadn't noticed.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.433
Didn't get my message to you.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.934
I tried to head you off.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.937
You mind that I came?

14:31.937 --> 14:33.439
(bird squawking)

14:33.439 --> 14:34.940
Ah, what the hell.
You're here.

14:38.944 --> 14:39.945
Well, come on.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.947
I want to get home before dark.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.450
Headlights don't work.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.951
You haven't changed.

14:45.951 --> 14:49.455
Haven't had to,
and I don't plan to.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.473
All Right.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.475
(seagull cawing)

15:09.475 --> 15:10.976
All right.

15:10.976 --> 15:11.977
Okay.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.479
Thanks a lot.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.482
The number's a general store

15:16.482 --> 15:18.484
in a little town
in Colorado-- Ouray.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.985
Harry Jackson
doesn't have a phone,

15:19.985 --> 15:21.487
but they know him, Axminster.

15:21.987 --> 15:22.988
They know where he lives.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.004
(truck thudding)

15:41.006 --> 15:44.009
You trying to throw me
or just scare me?

15:46.011 --> 15:48.013
You always did
like to talk.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.544
Still tough as a dirty boot,
aren't you?

16:18.544 --> 16:20.546
You're damn right.

16:40.065 --> 16:43.068
(door squeaking and closing)

16:44.069 --> 16:45.571
Well?

16:45.571 --> 16:47.072
Black, hot and strong, right?

16:47.072 --> 16:49.575
Nothin' wrong
with your memory, bud.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.577
Grandma used to say

16:51.577 --> 16:53.078
you'd never drink a cup
of coffee

16:53.078 --> 16:56.081
unless a spoon would stand up
in it.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.084
Grandma never did
give up trying
to civilize me.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.586
I guess maybe

17:00.586 --> 17:03.088
that was the only
dumb mistake
she ever did make.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.092
Except maybe dyin'.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.094
Is that why you left us?

17:11.597 --> 17:14.599
You always did get right
to the point.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.602
Haven't changed.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.605
Not much.

17:24.609 --> 17:25.611
Want coffee?

17:25.611 --> 17:27.112
Yeah.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.615
You didn't answer me.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.616
I left...

17:32.618 --> 17:34.119
because it was time to leave.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.121
No, when Dad died,
you were there.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.623
I mean, you were...
you were there.

17:37.623 --> 17:38.624
I stayed around

17:38.624 --> 17:39.625
for a while.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.126
God, for the love of Mike, boy,

17:41.126 --> 17:42.628
I still had the right
to my own life!

17:42.628 --> 17:43.629
Doggone it, Harry,

17:43.629 --> 17:46.632
I guess maybe it's...
how you did it.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.635
I wake up one morning,
and you're gone.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.137
I never liked good-byes.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.139
I

17:54.139 --> 17:55.641
took a job workin'

17:55.641 --> 17:57.142
in construction up in Alaska.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.144
Good job.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.146
New country.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.148
So I went.

18:03.148 --> 18:07.152
I figured sending money regular
would be more use

18:07.152 --> 18:08.654
to you and your mother
than I was.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.656
You figured wrong.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.660
That's your bunk.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.161
Leave or stay, it's up to you.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.180
We're ready
to roll, Axminster.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.687
(engines starting)

18:43.689 --> 18:45.691
How do you want
this guy MacGyver?

18:45.691 --> 18:46.692
Dead or alive?

18:46.692 --> 18:49.695
Dead.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.218
(birds singing)

19:27.733 --> 19:29.735
It's good.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.739
Now, why are you here?

19:38.744 --> 19:41.747
I guess I just got past
puttin' off this visit.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.253
I haven't thought
about family in years.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.756
Don't really want to now.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.260
Harry, were you always
this hard-nosed?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.262
Even when I was a kid?

20:01.266 --> 20:03.268
(sighs)

20:03.268 --> 20:05.771
I remember this.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.273
JACKSON:
Uh...

20:10.275 --> 20:12.277
Didn't I make this for you
when I was about ten?

20:12.277 --> 20:13.278
For your birthday or something?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.780
(quacking)

20:14.780 --> 20:16.782
It works good, too.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.785
Best I ever had.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.791
CARSON:
Cabin's at the top
of the ridge, Axminster.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.292
Then spread out.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.294
We'll surround the
cabin and hit 'em.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.799
So, you ready for some fishin'?

20:33.799 --> 20:34.800
I already been.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.802
What do you think
we're havin'
for breakfast?

20:36.802 --> 20:38.303
Come on, Harry.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.305
You're the one
that used to tell me

20:40.305 --> 20:42.808
you don't fish for fish,
you fish for fishin'.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.842
CARSON:
Cabin's empty,
Axminster!

21:17.843 --> 21:19.845
(birds singing)

21:19.845 --> 21:21.346
Nice.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.849
Yeah, it's real nice.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.352
Found this place
about eight years ago.

21:27.352 --> 21:30.355
I'm stayin' right here
till I die.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.859
Ah, you're too
mean to die.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.362
What goes around comes around.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.367
BLACK:
The truck's still
here, Axminster.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.369
They got
to be close.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.376
You know, I think Mom
and I missed you most

21:51.376 --> 21:53.378
around Thanksgiving, Christmas.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.382
I remember you used
to take me out
to cut a tree.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.884
Stop riding it!

21:58.884 --> 22:00.385
Is my being here

22:00.385 --> 22:01.386
that hard on you?

22:01.386 --> 22:02.387
Bud,

22:02.387 --> 22:04.890
subject is closed.

22:16.401 --> 22:19.905
(fishing line creaking)

22:19.905 --> 22:23.909
I got one.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.410
I got one!

22:28.413 --> 22:30.916
JACKSON:
I said drag, bud. Watch it.

22:30.916 --> 22:31.917
Ah, that's a beaut!

22:31.917 --> 22:32.918
That's for dinner.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.419
Don't let loose of him.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.421
I'm not gonna let loose of him.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.924
Get the net, Harry.

22:40.926 --> 22:41.927
(gunshot)

22:41.927 --> 22:43.428
Hey, what the...?

22:43.428 --> 22:44.429
(gunshots)

22:44.429 --> 22:45.931
Aah!

22:45.931 --> 22:48.934
(gunshots)

22:54.940 --> 22:56.942
What the hell is goin' on?

22:56.942 --> 22:58.443
I'll tell you
later. Come on.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.945
Who are your friends?

22:59.945 --> 23:01.947
Harry, I didn't think
they'd find me here.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.949
They'll probably be
down here in a minute.

23:06.952 --> 23:07.953
Let's go!

23:17.462 --> 23:20.465
JACKSON:
Hollow reeds?

23:20.465 --> 23:22.467
MacGYVER:
Yeah. We'll make 'em think

23:22.467 --> 23:24.469
we're still out there
in the water.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.972
They're too smart
for that one, boy.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.974
Got to try something.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.476
What if they do fall
for this stunt of yours, bud?

23:31.476 --> 23:32.978
What do we get out of it?

23:32.978 --> 23:34.980
Buy a little distance.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.983
All depends on them
believin' that it's us

23:37.983 --> 23:39.484
breathin'
under these reeds.

23:39.484 --> 23:42.487
Have a little faith, Harry.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.010
AXMINSTER:
Where the hell are they?

24:09.014 --> 24:10.015
Down there,
those reeds!

24:10.015 --> 24:11.016
Fire!

24:11.016 --> 24:16.021
(rapid gunfire)

24:16.021 --> 24:18.023
You, check it out.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.532
They tricked us.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.533
What are you
talking about?

24:28.533 --> 24:30.035
MacGyver set us up.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.037
Let's go tell Axminster.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.047
Guess your friends
found those reeds

24:42.047 --> 24:44.049
over on the other
side of the lake.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.052
See, your grandson's got
something on the ball.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.055
Hold it, Harry.

24:50.055 --> 24:54.059
It's a plant from
the Urtica family.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.060
Strong stuff.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.062
One dab in the bloodstream
hits the neural system

24:57.062 --> 24:58.063
and a guy's out for hours.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.064
Blow gun?

24:59.064 --> 25:02.067
I was thinking
along those lines.

25:02.567 --> 25:03.568
Ah.

25:20.085 --> 25:22.087
The only problem
we got, Harry,

25:22.087 --> 25:24.089
in order for me
to knock them out,

25:24.089 --> 25:26.091
I'm gonna have
to hit them just right.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.092
Right in the neck.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.095
What if you miss?

26:06.131 --> 26:07.632
Okay, here we go.

26:09.634 --> 26:10.635
HARRY:
Now we got a blow gun,

26:10.635 --> 26:13.638
maybe help to make kind of
a trail for them to track us.

26:20.645 --> 26:22.147
BLACK:
Hold it.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.149
Their trail
leads down to the stream.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.166
Hey, what's the matter?

26:41.166 --> 26:43.168
Hey, hey, what's...?

26:44.669 --> 26:48.173
(grunting)

26:48.173 --> 26:49.674
(yells)

26:57.682 --> 26:58.683
Nice.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.186
Gotta hit them
just right.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.687
Harry, can we get
out this way?

27:02.687 --> 27:04.189
Don't seem to have
a lot of choice.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.190
No.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.338
Hold it!

27:20.338 --> 27:22.340
Hold it
right there, bud.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.341
Will you stop?

27:23.341 --> 27:24.843
Now wait a minute!

27:24.843 --> 27:26.344
I said hold it
right there!

27:26.344 --> 27:29.347
Who are you, bud?

27:29.347 --> 27:31.850
Now what the devil's
all this about?

27:31.850 --> 27:34.352
I ain't moving
until I get an answer.

27:36.855 --> 27:37.856
I'm sorry, Harry.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.858
I shouldn't have come.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.359
I underestimated
some things.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.361
Just answer the question.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.364
It has to do

27:46.865 --> 27:50.368
with freedom
and peace, Harry.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.871
And some people
who don't like either.

27:56.374 --> 27:57.876
Well, I sure hope

27:57.876 --> 27:59.878
it's worth losing
that damn trout.

28:05.884 --> 28:06.885
They're still
alive, Axminster.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.887
Shall we
pick them up?

28:08.887 --> 28:09.387
AXMINSTER:
Forget them.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.390
Move it.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.392
We got a job to do.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.397
Is there a ranger
station around?

28:19.898 --> 28:22.400
How about
a fire lookout,

28:22.400 --> 28:23.902
a ranch, anything?

28:23.902 --> 28:25.904
Ah, let's see.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.906
Evermore, uh,
it's a little,

28:27.906 --> 28:29.908
old nothing town,
uh, half dead.

28:29.908 --> 28:31.409
Well, now they got
a phone line.

28:31.409 --> 28:32.410
How far is it?

28:32.410 --> 28:34.412
Oh, it's ten to 12 miles.

28:34.412 --> 28:35.914
It's up in
the high desert.

28:35.914 --> 28:36.915
All right.
Let's move.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.419
AXMINSTER:
Go that way.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.421
We'll swing around
the hill and meet you.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.923
CARSON:
Right.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.426
HARRY:
Haven't done this much running

28:48.426 --> 28:51.429
since two winters ago when
a grizzly was chasing me.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.932
Did he
catch you?

28:53.932 --> 28:56.434
HARRY:
Nah, got tired trying
to catch an old buzzard.

28:56.434 --> 28:57.435
Hey, what are
you doing now?

28:57.435 --> 28:58.937
Stop to collect
rocks?

29:04.442 --> 29:05.944
CARSON:
Maybe up that way.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.947
AXMINSTER:
Okay, we'll flush them out.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.448
See anything?

29:10.448 --> 29:11.950
MacGYVER:
Oh, I see a lot of things.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.952
Anything I'd be
interested in?

29:13.952 --> 29:16.454
Yeah.
Two jeeps splitting up.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.456
Only one's
heading our way,

29:18.456 --> 29:19.457
but he's gonna be

29:19.457 --> 29:21.459
a while getting here, so I
figure we got a little time.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.461
To do what?

29:23.461 --> 29:30.468
Harry, don't you remember
teaching me all about decoys?

29:30.468 --> 29:33.972
Why don't you fill
that up with branches?

29:33.972 --> 29:36.474
Oh, yeah, and make it
look like a man.

29:36.474 --> 29:41.980
Now let's see if I can get
this tree to do a few tricks.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.988
AXMINSTER:
No sign of them coming this way.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.489
CARSON:
Should I keep going?

29:51.489 --> 29:52.991
AXMINSTER:
We should figure out MacGyver.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.494
Then make a decision.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.998
Alpha,
Colin, Baker,

29:59.998 --> 30:00.999
do you read?

30:00.999 --> 30:02.000
This is Axminster.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.001
Are targets in sight?

30:03.001 --> 30:04.502
No, sir.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.504
No problem, it's just a little
cat and mouse. Keep moving.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.506
You got your orders.
Over and out.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.008
Okay?

30:10.008 --> 30:12.010
Head up
to high ground.

30:12.010 --> 30:14.512
AXMINSTER:
Yeah, it's a nice day
for hunting.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.534
Hey, Harry?

30:36.534 --> 30:38.036
Remember you used
to tell me about

30:38.036 --> 30:40.038
how the Indians fought this way?

30:40.038 --> 30:44.042
Bud...

30:44.042 --> 30:45.543
a lot of
that stuff

30:45.543 --> 30:49.047
I used to tell you
is, uh, is stories.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.050
Yeah, well, a lot
of it works, Harry.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.551
(Jeep approaching)

31:03.561 --> 31:07.065
(yelling)

31:14.072 --> 31:16.074
Damn.

31:16.074 --> 31:19.077
Thought we'd at least get
a free ride out of this.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.079
Guess we keep
on running.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.580
MacGYVER:
That's Axminster.
Let's get going.

31:36.094 --> 31:39.097
BLACK:
Axminster, the other jeep,
down in the gully.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.105
AXMINSTER:
Two more down.

31:47.605 --> 31:49.107
Let's finish this MacGyver now.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.615
You getting lightheaded, bud?

31:57.615 --> 31:59.617
Pinecones?

31:59.617 --> 32:01.619
Sure, Harry.

32:01.619 --> 32:04.122
Don't you remember ever
throwing one in a fire?

32:04.122 --> 32:05.623
What happens?

32:05.623 --> 32:08.126
It kind of explodes.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.628
Yeah, that's right.

32:10.628 --> 32:14.632
Add a little pine pitch and you
got the makings of a landmine.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.637
Ain't Mother
Nature grand?

32:29.147 --> 32:31.649
HARRY:
You just trying
to stay above them

32:31.649 --> 32:34.152
or you got some
kind of an idea?

32:34.152 --> 32:35.653
A little of both.

32:35.653 --> 32:38.156
No, I can manage!

32:46.664 --> 32:48.166
Hold it, Harry.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.670
I figure the Jeep'll
come from there

32:52.670 --> 32:54.672
right through here.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.177
Well, what
in the...?

32:59.177 --> 33:01.179
Time to bury the landmine.

33:05.683 --> 33:06.684
HARRY:
See something?

33:06.684 --> 33:08.186
MacGYVER:
Nope, but
I hear something.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.697
HARRY:
Ought to get
a move on.

33:19.697 --> 33:21.199
Ah, there's plenty of time.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.202
You sure that'll work?

33:24.202 --> 33:25.703
Nope.

33:25.703 --> 33:28.206
Bud, you are a comfort.

33:29.707 --> 33:32.210
HARRY:
Here they come.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.711
Come on, let's go.

33:43.721 --> 33:45.723
When I was a kid,
 I used to chew

33:45.723 --> 33:47.225
pine pitch like it was gum.

33:47.225 --> 33:51.729
It tasted all right,
but it burned a lot better.

33:56.734 --> 33:57.735
All right.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.744
(rapid gunfire)

34:15.253 --> 34:16.754
(grunting)

34:16.754 --> 34:18.255
Harry?

34:19.257 --> 34:20.257
I'm all right.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.260
Get him!

34:24.262 --> 34:28.266
(yelling)

34:28.266 --> 34:31.768
Come on, Harry,
let's get moving.

34:33.271 --> 34:35.273
AXMINSTER:
Can anybody still move?

34:35.273 --> 34:38.775
CARSON:
Yeah, good enough
to find MacGyver.

34:38.775 --> 34:40.277
BLACK:
Looks like we're
walking now, too.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.283
AXMINSTER:
Not walk, run.

34:45.283 --> 34:48.286
We'll run him right
into the ground.

34:56.293 --> 34:57.295
Well, that's okay.

34:57.295 --> 34:58.796
I'm just dinged.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.799
Yeah,
so I noticed.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.302
Just grazed
you, Harry.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.803
Could've been
worse, you know.

35:05.803 --> 35:09.307
Eh, hurts like worse.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.309
Put that inside.

35:11.309 --> 35:12.810
Put pressure on it.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.812
You all right?

35:32.330 --> 35:33.331
We made it.

35:33.331 --> 35:36.334
Yeah.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.836
HARRY:
Hey!

35:38.836 --> 35:43.341
MacGYVER:
So... this
is Evermore.

35:43.841 --> 35:44.842
(coughs)

35:44.842 --> 35:48.846
Harry, when was the last
time you were here?

35:48.846 --> 35:52.350
Too long ago.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.852
It's dead.

35:54.852 --> 35:57.355
I guess we are, too.

36:00.858 --> 36:01.859
Harry? Harry! Harry!

36:09.367 --> 36:11.869
Damn you, Axminster.

36:17.375 --> 36:22.380
So, there we were
in a ghost town, Harry and me.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.883
I tried to make him
as comfortable as possible.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.389
What are you trying, bud?

36:31.389 --> 36:32.890
That's fool's gold.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.392
Which contains

36:34.392 --> 36:35.893
pyrite-- iron sulfide.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.896
Mixing it up
with a little clay here

36:38.896 --> 36:40.898
kind of makes
a natural antibiotic.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.900
Let's see
what you got here.

36:45.403 --> 36:48.406
Just what is it
that you do, bud?

36:51.409 --> 36:53.911
Well, a little of this,
a little of that.

36:56.914 --> 36:59.417
(groans softly)

36:59.417 --> 37:04.422
Well, that... that
sure explains it.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.424
You're going
to be okay, Harry.

37:06.424 --> 37:08.426
Ever think of
hanging out a shingle

37:08.426 --> 37:09.427
as a medicine man?

37:16.934 --> 37:19.937
I've got something
to say.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.440
I've avoided you.

37:24.942 --> 37:26.444
You know why?

37:28.446 --> 37:29.947
Mom.

37:32.450 --> 37:36.454
First your grandmother.

37:36.454 --> 37:38.956
Then your mom.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.459
When the good
Lord took them,

37:41.959 --> 37:45.463
I hurt.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.966
I didn't want to be reminded,

37:48.966 --> 37:53.471
so I just, uh,
I just kept moving.

37:54.972 --> 37:56.974
Seeing you...

38:01.479 --> 38:03.981
I've missed you, bud.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.485
Something terrible.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.487
(softly):
Harry...

38:11.989 --> 38:14.492
(sighing)

38:14.492 --> 38:17.995
Well, that... sure
was a sorry sight.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.997
(sniffling)

38:19.997 --> 38:20.998
Hey.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.500
Don't you

38:22.500 --> 38:25.002
ever badmouth my grandpa,
you hear?

38:25.002 --> 38:27.004
(chuckling)

38:27.004 --> 38:29.006
(groaning)

38:29.507 --> 38:31.509
Look, I'm going
to try and find some things

38:31.509 --> 38:32.510
for us to fight with.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.011
What do you say?

38:38.516 --> 38:40.518
You really think they're going
to find us here?

38:40.518 --> 38:42.520
They're professionals, Harry.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.022
They'll find us.

38:53.531 --> 38:57.535
Harry had a good night's rest,
but I didn't sleep at all.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.537
I knew that, with first light,

38:59.537 --> 39:02.540
Axminster
would be tracking us again.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.043
So, I had to build
the best defense I could

39:06.043 --> 39:07.545
before they got to us.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.552
Hey, bud!

39:14.552 --> 39:16.053
Mind telling me
what you're doing?

39:16.053 --> 39:17.555
Yeah, found some grain dust.

39:17.555 --> 39:18.556
Treat it right,

39:18.556 --> 39:21.058
we got the makings
of a pretty good bomb,

39:21.058 --> 39:22.560
I'll betcha.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.061
Might work good.

39:24.061 --> 39:25.062
Got a little
parlor trick

39:25.062 --> 39:28.065
to get them to come up close
to where the explosion happens.

39:30.067 --> 39:34.071
Sometimes you hear
about floating grain dust

39:34.071 --> 39:36.073
exploding inside a silo.

39:36.073 --> 39:39.076
It's called
spontaneous combustion.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.579
I'm going to do it on purpose.

39:41.579 --> 39:44.081
And I found
a real handy partner in Harry.

39:44.081 --> 39:47.585
He seemed to be talking
just the way I was.

39:47.585 --> 39:51.088
Or maybe I'd been thinking
like him all along.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.089
HARRY:
Only get one shot

39:52.089 --> 39:54.091
with your exploding gadget,
bud.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.093
MacCGYVER:
What you got in mind, Harry?

39:56.093 --> 39:58.596
HARRY:
A little
remote control distraction.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.598
Guaranteed to get them galoots

40:00.598 --> 40:03.100
to come up real close
for the big surprise.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.103
Hey, bud, I can play magician
from over here!

40:06.103 --> 40:08.606
Now you see it, now you don't--
and boom!

40:19.116 --> 40:20.618
All right, that's enough.

40:20.618 --> 40:21.619
It's shaking,

40:21.619 --> 40:23.120
and I don't want it
falling on my head.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.121
Real trick's going
to be

40:24.121 --> 40:25.623
getting those galoots
in position.

40:25.623 --> 40:26.624
MacGYVER:
If they aren't

40:26.624 --> 40:28.125
right underneath it,
it won't work.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.126
Where are you going?

40:29.126 --> 40:30.127
HARRY:
Come on.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.130
I got a trick
of my own.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.632
What do you got,
pine nuts?

40:34.632 --> 40:36.133
HARRY:
Yeah, I used
to have fun with them

40:36.133 --> 40:37.635
when I was a kid.

40:37.635 --> 40:38.636
I'd, uh, drop them in the fire,

40:39.136 --> 40:41.138
and watch everybody jump,
and they'd crack,

40:41.138 --> 40:45.142
and they'd go off like gunshots.

40:45.142 --> 40:47.144
Well, they've
been falling

40:47.144 --> 40:48.646
for your foolishness.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.648
I figured
I'd try some of my own.

40:50.648 --> 40:54.151
I think Harry was beginning
to enjoy the game.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.153
And that's all the time we had.

42:25.743 --> 42:26.744
(clanking)

42:43.761 --> 42:46.263
(men yelling)

43:06.784 --> 43:07.284
(loud popping)

43:12.289 --> 43:14.792
(loud popping)

43:16.293 --> 43:17.294
(man grunts)

43:21.799 --> 43:23.300
Got him good.

43:23.300 --> 43:24.301
Yeah.

43:38.315 --> 43:40.317
We still have Axminster.

43:40.317 --> 43:43.320
Only this time,
we got the odds.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.822
Yeah.

43:50.828 --> 43:51.829
Ow!

43:54.331 --> 43:55.833
(grunting)

43:55.833 --> 43:57.334
(gun cocking)

43:57.835 --> 43:59.336
(gunshot)

44:06.844 --> 44:08.345
Try, try to move him over, bud.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.347
(grunting)

44:12.349 --> 44:13.851
Now, bud!

44:14.852 --> 44:17.855
(yelling)

44:21.358 --> 44:24.361
You all right, bud?

44:24.361 --> 44:26.864
I'm more than all right, Harry.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.369
(groans)

44:33.871 --> 44:35.372
Whew!

44:35.372 --> 44:36.874
(both laugh)

44:39.376 --> 44:41.378
You figuring
on coming back this way?

44:41.378 --> 44:42.880
Count on it.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.382
I'll look forward to it.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.384
Me, too.

45:07.905 --> 45:09.907
Hey, Harry...

45:09.907 --> 45:12.409
catch that big old trout,
will you?

45:13.911 --> 45:15.412
Count on it.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.418
Take care
of yourself, bud.

45:50.347 --> 45:54.451
