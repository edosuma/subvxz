WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.570
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
I am innocent of the murder
I was accused of.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.438
Whoever killed that
boy will kill again.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.740
I wanted to give you
children.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.475
Anne and James.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.443
Francis, don't leave me,
not yet.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.445
This is Delphine, a healer.
I've brought her for Francis.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.180
It's too late.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.448
BASH:
There's no guarantee
she can help.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.583
And even if she can there may be

00:17.585 --> 00:19.218
a price of someone else's life.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.587
(gasps)

00:21.589 --> 00:23.188
Francis?
Oh, my God!

00:25.393 --> 00:27.559
Madam de Guise...
she's dead!

00:28.729 --> 00:32.131
MARY:<i> Thank you</i>
<i> for your grace and peace,</i>

00:32.133 --> 00:33.232
for the mercy
you grant those

00:33.234 --> 00:35.067
you draw to your
side once again,

00:35.069 --> 00:37.469
and the extraordinary
blessings you've given me.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.377
You've been down here
for a long time.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.479
I have much to thank God for.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.115
Every time you
walk into a room,

00:50.117 --> 00:52.117
you fill my heart with such joy.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.520
I feel like I owe my life
to Marie de Guise.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.790
There is no one who can tell
if her life was the price

00:57.792 --> 01:00.759
Delphine spoke of or just
a terrible coincidence.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.594
But my mother was so ill

01:02.596 --> 01:04.396
and in so much pain for so long,

01:04.398 --> 01:07.332
I am at peace
with her passing, Francis.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.667
I will pray for her.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.735
And we should talk
about the regency

01:09.737 --> 01:12.237
that she left behind.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.339
You need to install someone
to rule in your name.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.841
And you need to do so quickly.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.843
Nothing can cripple
your country faster

01:17.845 --> 01:19.645
than the prospect
of instability.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.414
I was going to reinstate
my half brother James.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.349
A Protestant.

01:24.351 --> 01:27.553
James is both religiously
tolerant and loyal to me.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.822
Oh, so much so that his own
Protestant supporters

01:29.824 --> 01:31.623
ousted him when he
refused to turn on you.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.525
What makes you think that
they would want him back?

01:33.527 --> 01:36.161
They know I could easily
appoint a Catholic regent.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.629
And they'd be foolish

01:37.631 --> 01:39.131
to defy me.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.399
Assuming, of course,

01:40.401 --> 01:42.134
James wants to
be reinstated.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.736
But I plan on writing him
a very convincing letter.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.844
Are you even listening to me?

01:51.846 --> 01:54.213
You are so beautiful.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.882
If you could see
what I see.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.319
I'm quite happy with my view.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.559
You don't want
to stay at court?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.561
Where I was once
nearly burned alive?

02:09.563 --> 02:11.663
No, thank you.
You're safe here now.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.332
As a show of gratitude
for saving his life,

02:13.334 --> 02:14.466
Francis has pardoned you.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.168
For a murder I never committed.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.337
For witchcraft
I do not practice.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.672
And if you go,
where will you live?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.574
The killer
you pointed me to

02:22.576 --> 02:24.309
is still out there-- stay.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.278
Help me capture this monster.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.479
And then?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.714
And then people
will not only accept you,

02:28.716 --> 02:30.582
they will laud you
for your gifts.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.385
Will you?

02:35.189 --> 02:37.723
I appreciate all you
have done for me.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.859
And I know you're trying to find
a way to make me useful,

02:40.861 --> 02:43.695
but my abilities are beyond
anyone's comprehension.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.265
Even yours.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.203
I may not understand your gift,
but I have experienced it.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.438
The night they tried to
burn you at the stake,

02:53.440 --> 02:55.340
you came to me in what
I thought was a dream.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.177
You told me about a ritual
you did to bind us together.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.578
That's how
I found you.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.313
It worked?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.382
Since then I've been
sensing things you've sensed

03:03.384 --> 03:05.217
and feeling things
that you've felt.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.952
I wanted to bring us closer.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.621
I'm sorry,
I had no right to do it.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.423
No, you didn't.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.359
We were connected, Delphine,
even before you cast your spell.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.861
I only wish you'd

03:15.863 --> 03:17.930
let things
run their natural course.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.334
I will stay.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.437
But first, I will undo
the wrong I have done.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.439
I will unbind us.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.907
How?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.576
There's a ritual that will
end our shared sensations.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.544
But it is not
for the faint of heart.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.682
Please ensure this is delivered
into the hands of my brother

03:36.684 --> 03:39.851
James, Earl of Moray.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.321
Wonderful news about
the king's recovery.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.989
Indeed it is.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.992
Though you have my condolences
on the death of your mother.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.727
Thank you.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.596
It is likely you are
the only Englishman

03:50.598 --> 03:52.864
to express sympathy at
the death of Marie de Guise.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.434
I may be the enemy,
but I'm not without my manners.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.971
The same can't be said for
your queen, Sir Nicholas.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.472
Considering the
amount of pressure

04:00.474 --> 04:02.374
my mother was under
from the English--

04:02.376 --> 04:04.276
pressure that I'm sure
contributed to her ill health--

04:04.278 --> 04:07.512
it's not surprising Elizabeth
didn't send her condolences.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.348
What interests you more--

04:09.350 --> 04:10.682
words or actions?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.384
For Elizabeth has sent
something along for you.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.552
Something momentous

04:13.554 --> 04:15.887
that would please
even your late mother.

04:15.889 --> 04:20.359
The queen of England has sent
you a formal offer of peace.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.571
Elizabeth doesn't seem to be
someone who would admit defeat.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.274
Why is she presenting
the peace accord now?

04:35.276 --> 04:38.844
Elizabeth's Scottish cause is
not popular amongst her nobles.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.613
My queen recognizes
it is time to end the fighting,

04:41.615 --> 04:42.881
and I know you do, too.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.051
And what are the official terms?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.919
French and English troops
are to withdraw

04:47.921 --> 04:50.022
from Scotland immediately,
thus ending the war.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.923
Is that it?

04:51.925 --> 04:54.626
You must also sign away

04:54.628 --> 04:56.995
your claim
to the English throne.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.930
Give up my birthright?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.799
Those are the terms.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.401
You knew this was a bad deal.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.669
That's why you came
to me privately.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.437
I came to offer you
a piece of advice.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.805
Don't put
too much stock

05:06.807 --> 05:08.540
in your royal
English birthright.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.677
I am the direct
descendant of Henry VII.

05:11.679 --> 05:15.480
I have a legitimate claim to the
English throne, beyond, or even

05:15.482 --> 05:17.683
Elizabeth's supporters say,
behind Elizabeth's.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.818
Which matters greatly,
as you are married.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.353
You come with
the promise of heirs

05:21.355 --> 05:22.688
who would ensure
a smooth line of succession.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.323
However, you don't
have children yet.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.991
Elizabeth is not even wed.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.959
The fact that she's choosy
doesn't mean she won't be.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.995
When she marries, she could
get pregnant like that.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.563
The moment she does,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.498
you lose your advantage.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.667
You'll get nothing in exchange.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.838
Despite her positive attributes,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.873
Elizabeth can be
vindictive and impulsive.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.444
You've outwitted her twice,
and yet she is offering peace.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.978
This accord represents
a moment of equanimity

05:46.980 --> 05:48.714
that, no doubt,
will be fleeting.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.982
I leave
for England tomorrow.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.718
You have until sundown.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.589
CATHERINE:
Remove all the bedding,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.991
all traces of the odious spirits
that sickened my son.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.561
Francis, wait till you see
the new window dressings.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.730
I'm gonna have all
of the furniture

06:04.732 --> 06:06.098
recovered as well.

06:06.100 --> 06:06.932
Well, what do you think?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.100
I think it's excessive,

06:08.102 --> 06:09.134
and I want you to stop.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.068
Well, your chamber needs to be

06:10.070 --> 06:12.471
bright and clean, romantic.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.639
The perfect place
for a king and queen to make

06:14.641 --> 06:16.875
future princes and princesses.
Here I thought

06:16.877 --> 06:19.778
I was the one experiencing
a new lease on life.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.380
We thought we'd
lost you forever,

06:21.382 --> 06:22.781
but then that remarkable
woman Delphine

06:22.783 --> 06:25.083
saved you, and
I'm so grateful.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.853
They're redecorating
her chambers next.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.621
Be honest.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.022
There was a small part of you

06:31.024 --> 06:32.958
that coveted the regency,
wasn't there?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.761
It's a good job for someone
who's always right, to be sure.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.731
But as it turns out,
many people quite despise me.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.634
I would never want to ascend
to power if it meant losing you.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.070
For what is France
without my Francis?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.573
No! St. Anthony needs

06:48.575 --> 06:51.042
to face the bed, not the door.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.745
The patron saint
of pregnant women.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.847
Be careful now.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.617
How many times
have I told you?

06:58.619 --> 07:01.553
(seagulls cawing)

07:09.963 --> 07:11.763
It's not moving.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.968
Now, set your course.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.739
Tighten the sheet
until the sail stops luffing.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.680
There you are.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.582
Now, see, your sails
are trimmed correctly.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.584
You did it.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.586
No, you did it.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.588
Well, that's not the way
I'll remember it.

07:36.590 --> 07:40.725
¶ Forever and always yours ¶

07:40.727 --> 07:42.227
¶ I'm yours. ¶

07:42.229 --> 07:44.029
I'm never going to get
the hang of this.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.731
We have time for
you to learn.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.233
And I'll teach you.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.968
Sailing merely
requires focus.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.003
And I can tell that
you're distracted.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.173
Do you want to talk
about the accord?

07:55.175 --> 07:58.643
I know you're
against me giving up

07:58.645 --> 08:00.145
my claim
to the English throne.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.081
But it's a real opportunity
for peace for Scotland.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.983
And to bring
the French troops home.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.552
You would be turning your back
on all those who yearn

08:07.554 --> 08:09.187
to see a Catholic
on the English throne.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.057
Your birthright is your
most precious possession.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.559
Think twice before
trading it.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.596
You are my most
precious possession.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.764
Our marriage,

08:19.766 --> 08:22.000
our life together.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.770
Not some hope that
if a hundred calamities align,

08:25.772 --> 08:27.906
I might sit
on the English throne.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.142
You should not
do this for me.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.678
I'm giving up
my claim for me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.180
And for Scotland.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.682
To give James a fighting chance
to rule as regent.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.684
In a time of peace,
not war.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.653
Francis?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.688
I never want to leave you.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.590
If James rules well...

08:45.592 --> 08:47.859
You would never go home?

08:49.530 --> 08:50.829
You are my home.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.731
France is my home.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.767
I've lived here
since I was a child.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.738
And we... we've been given
a miraculous second chance.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.739
(quiet laugh)

09:00.741 --> 09:01.806
I won't waste it.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.742
Not a minute of it.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.616
My God.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.084
Nostradamus.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.719
I heard you were back.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.621
Decorum would dictate

09:16.623 --> 09:18.290
that my guests be announced.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.725
Even an old friend
such as yourself.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.295
But I suppose,
as you never said good-bye...

09:23.297 --> 09:26.031
I departed quietly after you
left me in the courtyard,

09:26.033 --> 09:27.866
about to be drawn and quartered.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.303
I'm grateful to you
for treating my son's illness.

09:31.305 --> 09:34.739
Let's not hold grudges.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.308
But many do resent you.

09:36.310 --> 09:39.878
I hear your battle to become
regent has not been easy.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.780
Well, thankfully,
that is a thing of the past.

09:41.782 --> 09:45.116
As my son's health
has improved considerably.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.620
I say this because I care
about your children,

09:48.622 --> 09:50.121
not your aspirations.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.790
Your fight may not be over.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.792
Why would I fight to be regent

09:53.794 --> 09:55.727
when the king, my son, is alive?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.862
I spoke with Francis,

09:57.864 --> 10:00.265
who shared with me the
moments before he died.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.933
They perfectly
matched the vision

10:01.935 --> 10:03.268
I've always had about his death.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.804
Well, then your vision
is true but incomplete.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.739
You didn't know the healer
Delphine would revive him.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.140
Perhaps.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.910
But there were
other images I saw

10:11.912 --> 10:13.745
concerning Francis' fate.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.313
These were more strange

10:15.315 --> 10:17.882
and dreamlike.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.784
Tell me.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.220
There is a glade,

10:22.222 --> 10:24.222
<i> a spring day and yet</i>

10:24.224 --> 10:26.057
snow at the base of a tree.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.826
On closer reflection,

10:27.828 --> 10:29.828
<i> the white</i>
<i> is from fallen petals.</i>

10:29.830 --> 10:31.630
And then there is blood

10:31.632 --> 10:33.031
<i> spattered across</i>
<i> some of the petals.</i>

10:33.033 --> 10:34.799
<i> Blood coming from above.</i>

10:34.801 --> 10:36.968
A sky raining blood?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.103
I'm not sure.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.771
I always awaken at this moment.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.806
And this vision, this dream,
it returns to you?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.341
It has, yes.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.110
Since the other prophecy
was fulfilled,

10:45.112 --> 10:47.679
how many days
since you've had this?

10:47.681 --> 10:50.115
I awoke from this dream
just this morning.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.050
The threat has not
passed, Catherine.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.985
You're sure this is
about Francis?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.854
Yes.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.856
Well, what danger does he face?
What can he avoid?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.258
I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you
what there is to fear.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.327
But he trusts you.
You must warn him.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.862
Of what, exactly?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.764
The king basks
in his resurrection.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.998
You are his mother.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
Perhaps he'll listen to you.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.734
I'm not sure that he will.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.903
Well, he must, for
if he does not,

11:11.905 --> 11:13.938
I believe King Francis will die.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.182
¶ ¶

11:41.201 --> 11:43.134
¶ ¶

11:54.448 --> 11:57.082
On behalf of Queen Elizabeth,
I am pleased to announce

11:57.084 --> 11:59.484
that the conflict
between our two countries

11:59.486 --> 12:01.352
can finally come to an end.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.121
You have Queen Mary
to thank for that.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.791
She's made a great sacrifice
in the name of peace,

12:06.793 --> 12:09.094
giving up her claim
to the English throne.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.463
Thank you, Your Majesty.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.832
Once Queen Elizabeth
has signed this accord,

12:13.834 --> 12:16.935
we will make a public
announcement at court,

12:16.937 --> 12:18.236
festivities included.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.943
Well, I suppose you're going
to have to settle

12:24.945 --> 12:26.945
for being the queen
of two nations, not three.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.481
MESSENGER:
Your Majesty, the queen mother

12:29.483 --> 12:31.349
is insistent
that she speak to you at once.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.990
Shall we begin?

12:38.992 --> 12:40.291
Yes.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.461
You will survive this,
I promise you.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.196
I'm trying to forget
the alternative is an option.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.432
(sighs)

12:53.173 --> 12:55.874
<i> Ur gochten nar fiel.</i>

12:55.876 --> 12:57.275
<i> Ur gochten lo seag.</i>

12:57.277 --> 12:59.444
<i> En trackay clahn.</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:00.512
<i> Agus moor.</i>

13:00.514 --> 13:02.247
<i> Atis nur.</i>

13:03.850 --> 13:05.150
<i> Ur gochten nar fiel.</i>

13:05.152 --> 13:06.518
<i> Ur gochten lo seag.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:08.386
<i> En trackay clahn.</i>

13:08.388 --> 13:09.854
<i> Agus moor.</i>

13:09.856 --> 13:10.989
<i> Atis nur.</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:12.157
Now.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.459
(gasps)

13:15.862 --> 13:17.962
(groaning)

13:21.268 --> 13:23.501
(banging)

13:26.139 --> 13:29.974
(groaning continues)

13:29.976 --> 13:31.209
(banging, muffled shouting)

13:33.046 --> 13:35.413
(gasping)

13:35.415 --> 13:37.015
For God's sake,
you nearly drowned me.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.449
The symbols I painted
on your body,

13:38.451 --> 13:41.052
they represented
our shared connection.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.704
I had to wait for them

13:42.705 --> 13:44.355
to leave your body
and reenter mine.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.924
Did it work?

13:45.926 --> 13:50.195
Can you feel what I feel?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.597
I feel nothing.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.332
Then it worked.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.235
'Cause if you could feel
what I feel,

13:57.237 --> 14:00.538
you would have
a much different reaction.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.474
A glowing tree?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.176
Droplets of blood on flowers?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.012
What does any of this mean?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.847
I'm not sure, but I thought
you should know at once.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.348
Know what, exactly?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.450
The specifics don't matter.
You're in danger.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.219
How does this foretell my death?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.854
Does he see me in this vision?

14:15.856 --> 14:19.524
It's not always black and white.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.559
Some prophecies
he sees clearly.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.927
Others are more symbolic.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.562
There's something ominous
in your future.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.598
Your fever of the brain,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.032
it's only recently subsided.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.901
Your health is not yet
fully restored.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.436
I'm your mother--
you think I can't tell?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.104
Francis, please,

14:33.106 --> 14:34.505
I urge you to be safe.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.374
How?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.176
(sighs)
Surround yourself with guards.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.344
Don't leave the castle.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.411
I will not be confined.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.913
Only until he learns more.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.448
Mother, I will
not hide here

14:43.450 --> 14:44.616
waiting for a dream of my death.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.050
(sighs)

14:46.052 --> 14:47.585
I'm not being reckless,
I'm living my life.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.888
And if you could
see what I see...

14:49.890 --> 14:53.024
The colors, they're so much
brighter than before,

14:53.026 --> 14:56.094
and every moment, every emotion.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.129
Your illness,
all you've been through,

14:58.131 --> 14:59.397
it's changed you.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.566
Well, I don't know, perhaps,
but I do know

15:01.568 --> 15:03.401
that I want to spend every day
sailing with Mary

15:03.403 --> 15:05.937
until the snows come, and I want
to visit the Matterhorn

15:05.939 --> 15:07.405
and the Verdon Gorge,
and yes, I will take

15:07.407 --> 15:08.606
every precaution
along the way--

15:08.608 --> 15:10.975
if only for the sake
of the people I love,

15:10.977 --> 15:12.143
including you.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.544
(sighs)

15:13.546 --> 15:15.680
I know that you mean well.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.116
Your actions have
always been motivated

15:18.118 --> 15:20.084
by your devotion towards me.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.087
To all your children.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.290
To you most of all.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.691
I shouldn't have favorites.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.660
(chuckles)

15:28.662 --> 15:32.297
But you, my golden child,
I can't lose you.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.166
I won't lose you.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.168
But you cannot keep me
in a cage,

15:37.170 --> 15:38.503
even one built with love.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.641
¶ ¶

15:51.551 --> 15:53.952
GREER: Did you really
sign away your claim?

15:53.954 --> 15:57.221
It was the only way
to end the war.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.092
Well, I quite like
the new banners.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.328
Who needs the
English lion anyway?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.032
Our bags are packed

16:08.034 --> 16:09.534
and our carriage awaits.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.668
We're going to Paris.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.503
I didn't know we had plans
for Paris.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.372
We didn't.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.107
But then I decided we should go.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.376
We have some dancing to do
at the Louvre Palace.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.379
It appears I must be going.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.386
(laughs)

16:32.425 --> 16:34.659
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.528
I picked these flowers for you
when I heard your mother passed.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.130
I hope they make you

16:39.132 --> 16:40.565
feel better.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.133
Thank you so much.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.334
They do.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.144
Fallen petals.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.279
(horse whinnies)

17:05.525 --> 17:07.191
(horse whinnying)

17:12.098 --> 17:14.532
A trip to Paris.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.768
What a wonderful secret
you've kept from me.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.370
Well, I have a secret
for you, too.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.372
Do you want to hear it?
Mm-hmm.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.608
I always knew we would be wed,

17:23.610 --> 17:26.677
even when I first returned
and you were nothing but worry

17:26.679 --> 17:28.679
and reservations. I knew.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.548
Did you, now?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.584
Ever since I caught your eye,

17:32.585 --> 17:34.619
watching me dance with my ladies
at your sister's wedding.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.621
Feathers falling from nowhere.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.456
Well, I'm sure my mother
ordered them.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.591
My sister was also
quite specific.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.760
Don't you remember
when we were children?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.295
I did.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.264
I remembered.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.266
I'm sure I knew
in that moment, too.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.801
That we were fated?

17:49.803 --> 17:52.603
I don't care for that word.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.238
What is it?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.706
It's nothing.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.075
Never mind.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.685
(sighs)

18:07.687 --> 18:10.188
(whinnying)

18:10.190 --> 18:13.191
(panting)

18:13.193 --> 18:14.725
Francis, wait.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.227
Driver, stop here.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.462
Whoa!

18:17.464 --> 18:19.230
(whinnying)

18:19.232 --> 18:20.431
What are you doing?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.166
I want to show you something.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.740
There's a beautiful lake
down in the forest.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.343
What do you say
we go for a swim?

18:32.345 --> 18:35.880
We could leave our clothes
on the shore and...

18:35.882 --> 18:37.648
Wait for us here.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.750
¶ I am caught by the space ¶

18:39.752 --> 18:42.687
¶ In between ¶

18:44.491 --> 18:46.858
¶ Words you've not spoken ¶

18:48.194 --> 18:51.896
¶ The words you've not spoken ¶

18:51.898 --> 18:54.565
¶ Together we're golden ¶

18:56.636 --> 18:58.636
¶ Everything will be all right ¶

18:58.638 --> 19:03.307
¶ Together we're golden ¶

19:03.309 --> 19:07.345
¶ As long as there's you
at my side ¶

19:07.347 --> 19:11.215
¶ Together we're golden ¶

19:11.217 --> 19:16.854
¶ Everything will be all right ¶

19:18.358 --> 19:20.691
¶ Together we're golden ¶

19:20.693 --> 19:22.793
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.564
¶ Everything will be all right ¶

19:26.566 --> 19:30.434
¶ Together we're golden ¶

19:30.436 --> 19:34.305
¶ As long as there's you
at my side ¶

19:34.307 --> 19:37.575
¶ Together we're golden. ¶

19:45.518 --> 19:49.453
(chuckles)

20:02.702 --> 20:05.303
¶ ¶

20:19.953 --> 20:22.587
(birds singing)

20:22.589 --> 20:25.356
I'm taking you to the place
the last attack happened.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.958
I'm not sure
how helpful I will be.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.893
Maybe something
will spark a memory

20:28.895 --> 20:30.761
or define a feeling you had.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.831
Delphine, do you feel something?

20:33.833 --> 20:34.999
Yes.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.001
Such a chill.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.402
Anger.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.870
Fear.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.874
Over there.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.245
Let's go.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.883
Someone is likely in there.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.485
Be careful.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.956
It's empty. It's all right.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.727
That's odd.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.295
You sure we're
in the right place?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.763
I'm certain.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.633
There is evil here,
murderous desire.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.339
These marks.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.041
It looks like someone
tried to open a door.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.576
And where is the door?

21:40.400 --> 21:41.499
What is it?

21:41.501 --> 21:42.600
I'm not sure.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.537
Vinegar.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.408
It's a heart.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.611
A human heart.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.081
Three hearts, three murders.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.816
That must have been
what I was feeling.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.618
The rest of the jars are empty.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.553
I'd say he's far from done.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.422
(gasps)

22:04.424 --> 22:05.856
What is it?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.024
It's going to happen again.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.460
Someone will die.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.962
(door opens)

22:21.574 --> 22:23.641
(gasping)

22:23.643 --> 22:25.376
(horse neighs)

22:27.113 --> 22:30.748
BASH:
Stop in the name
of the king!

22:30.750 --> 22:31.749
What happened?

22:31.751 --> 22:32.983
The horse is gone.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.118
He got away.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.519
It was the killer
I was feeling.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.854
Was he tracking us?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.389
Were we seen?

22:38.391 --> 22:40.591
I don't think so.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.628
This is fresh blood.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.597
Another kill.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.667
Is he bringing another heart
back to add to his collection?

22:58.778 --> 23:00.644
A farm boy was killed
not far from the barn

23:00.646 --> 23:02.079
shortly before we arrived.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.581
His heart was ripped out.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.049
We were right.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.651
The murderer was returning
with a new trophy.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.120
Was it the boy's
pain you felt?

23:09.122 --> 23:12.156
No, I-I think I sensed
the murderer's emotions.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.126
They are powerful urges,
impossible to ignore.

23:15.128 --> 23:18.562
And far more intense than
anything I have felt before.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.632
Thank you for helping me.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.634
Of course.

23:26.472 --> 23:29.140
(gasping)

23:30.610 --> 23:32.710
Delphine?

23:49.162 --> 23:51.462
I'm going to go back to
the carriage to get our lunch.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.696
No, I'll go.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.165
Ah, not like that
you won't.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.633
(chuckles)

23:55.635 --> 23:57.001
You're still recovering.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.069
You said yourself
your head hurts.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.138
You need to rest.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.740
I'll be right back.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.191
He took another life.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.659
So soon after the last.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.827
Are you sure?

24:22.829 --> 24:24.528
We angered him.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.096
I felt his rage
as he ripped

24:26.098 --> 24:27.865
the heart
from his victim's chest.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.733
Are you sure you're all right?

24:29.735 --> 24:31.969
I've seen you absorb
others' pain before.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.704
It never made you unconscious.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.972
Has something changed?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.107
It doesn't matter.
I want to help.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.076
The unbinding ritual.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.845
Has it affected
you in some way?

24:40.847 --> 24:43.113
Are the feelings you experience
stronger as a result?

24:43.115 --> 24:44.715
Isn't that what we want?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.150
Clearer signals
that the killer is close?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.618
That he's about to strike?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.653
I don't want you to suffer.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.858
It was wrong of me
to ask you to stay.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.759
I want to help you.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.229
I want to be around you.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.600
And I want to be with you.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.803
You are the kindest,

25:05.805 --> 25:09.006
most selfless person
I've ever known.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.099

25:43.776 --> 25:45.643
(gasps)

25:46.612 --> 25:47.745
(muffled scream)

25:50.950 --> 25:52.783
Kill her in the cover
of the woods,

25:52.785 --> 25:53.918
in case the guards come running.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.186
(muffled screaming)

25:59.725 --> 26:02.326
(branches snap nearby)

26:03.729 --> 26:06.096
Mary?

26:33.225 --> 26:34.692
(Mary screaming)

26:34.694 --> 26:36.760
Mary.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.332
Guards!

26:41.334 --> 26:43.233
(grunting)

26:43.235 --> 26:44.368
Guards!

26:48.774 --> 26:50.174
Guards!

27:00.119 --> 27:02.052
(gasps)

27:08.894 --> 27:10.394
No!

27:10.396 --> 27:11.762
Francis!

27:11.764 --> 27:13.897
Stop it! No!

27:13.899 --> 27:15.199
No! Francis!

27:20.039 --> 27:21.171
Francis!

27:21.173 --> 27:22.973
(grunting)

27:34.353 --> 27:36.020
Let him go.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.356
The other guards
will find him.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.336
(muttering)

27:52.338 --> 27:53.837
Francis?

27:55.975 --> 27:58.042
Francis?

27:59.445 --> 28:00.711
Your head.
Can you hear me?

28:00.713 --> 28:01.779
Can you hear me?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.080
The king has been injured.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.281
Get help!
Now!

28:04.283 --> 28:06.884
They're going
to get the carriage,

28:06.886 --> 28:08.185
and we're going to go
back to the castle.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.187
You're going to be all right.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.290
No, I won't.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.693
Francis.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.262
No, we were meant to be happy,

28:18.264 --> 28:21.098
and we were, but

28:21.100 --> 28:22.766
I have another fate,

28:22.768 --> 28:24.868
predicted long ago.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.236
No, no, no, no, no!

28:26.238 --> 28:27.705
We were given
a second chance.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.473
Well, maybe there is no magic

28:29.475 --> 28:31.842
but what we make for ourselves.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.210
No, but Delphine...

28:33.212 --> 28:34.778
No.

28:34.780 --> 28:35.913
No more.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.049
No more.

28:41.187 --> 28:44.121
Please make sure
that my son is cared for.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.123
That he knows that I loved him.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.326
And promise me
that you'll stay in France

28:49.328 --> 28:52.830
until the future king...

28:54.767 --> 28:56.834
...until he is safe

28:56.836 --> 28:59.203
and my mother is secured
as regent.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.938
Please.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.973
Francis, don't leave me.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.842
Mary.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.076
No, don't...

29:06.078 --> 29:07.811
Promise me.

29:07.813 --> 29:10.814
Promise me you'll stay.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.250
I will, I will.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.319
I promise, I promise.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.060
I see...

29:24.864 --> 29:26.363
<i> ...such beauty.</i>

29:45.284 --> 29:48.152
Such beauty
you have brought me.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.854
(laughs)

29:53.292 --> 29:55.359
You must...

29:56.562 --> 29:59.062
You must wed again.

30:00.566 --> 30:01.865
You must love again.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.333
I can't.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.169
I will never.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.504
I will never love anyone
the way I love you.

30:12.044 --> 30:16.814
I pray to God that you do.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.824
(gasping)

30:34.433 --> 30:37.000
Francis!
(crying)

31:06.365 --> 31:07.564
(knocking)

31:07.566 --> 31:09.633
Enter.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.276
What is it?

31:20.913 --> 31:23.046
Speak to me.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.382
Ca-Catherine,

31:25.384 --> 31:27.985
it's Francis.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.956
No.

31:35.961 --> 31:38.028
(birds singing quietly)

31:43.402 --> 31:45.936
(gasps)

31:50.643 --> 31:52.342
Queen Mother,
it's...

32:04.123 --> 32:06.556
¶ ¶

32:15.668 --> 32:18.135
Mary...

32:18.137 --> 32:19.369
No.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.507
That isn't Francis.
He's gone.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.542
I can't let him go.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.611
Let go and
hold onto me.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.124
(Mary sobs)

32:42.061 --> 32:44.127
¶ ¶

33:13.492 --> 33:16.093
MARY (crying):
No, Francis.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.161
(sobbing)

33:27.539 --> 33:29.573
Is your queen behind this?

33:29.575 --> 33:31.575
Your Majesty?
Assassins
attacked me.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.643
Francis saved my life,
but now he is dead.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.579
And there is only one
person I can think of

33:35.581 --> 33:36.780
who wants me eliminated.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.016
Elizabeth has
no motive.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.517
You said that
she was impulsive.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.519
You said that
she was vindictive.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.155
Maybe this is revenge for all of
the times I've outwitted her.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.657
You gave her what she wanted
when you signed the accord!

33:47.659 --> 33:49.426
The only way I am no longer
a threat to Elizabeth

33:49.428 --> 33:50.660
is if I am gone!

33:50.662 --> 33:52.195
She is not behind this!

33:53.298 --> 33:55.799
Was Francis
an intended victim, too?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.667
Is she trying
to destroy

33:57.669 --> 33:59.403
my alliance with France?

33:59.405 --> 34:00.804
Is that it?

34:00.806 --> 34:04.107
(sobs)
I know you need someone
to blame right now,

34:04.109 --> 34:06.143
but Elizabeth would never order
the death of another monarch

34:06.145 --> 34:08.445
for fear that someone
would dare to kill her.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.380
It's not a precedent
she wants set.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.682
She supported Condé's attack!
She supported the coup,

34:12.684 --> 34:15.552
but what happened to Francis
after that was up to the French.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.721
Don't do anything rash!

34:17.723 --> 34:19.790
I have been left with nothing!

34:19.792 --> 34:22.426
I will take back
what is mine,

34:22.428 --> 34:25.662
and if you want to stop me,
you'll have to kill me.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.798
That doesn't change anything.
You signed that accord.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.800
It is your word against mine.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.170
England has taken enough

34:33.172 --> 34:35.539
from me this day.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.643
(sobbing angrily)

34:47.653 --> 34:49.486
(screams)

34:49.488 --> 34:51.188

35:33.365 --> 35:35.432
¶ ¶

35:47.880 --> 35:50.847
This is not how we were
supposed to go to Paris.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.485
We were supposed
to dance under the stars.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.460
I can't believe he's gone.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.662
He will live on...

36:05.664 --> 36:07.564
in your son.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.509
Your Majesty, the assassin

36:19.511 --> 36:22.946
who got away
has been captured.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.548
Who is he?

36:24.550 --> 36:27.817
A Scottish Protestant
named Taron Hambleton.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.956
He's not one of
Elizabeth's sympathizers.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.559
He's part of a radical
sect of lords in Scotland

36:35.561 --> 36:37.360
who want
self-government.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.763
When your mother died,
he and his followers

36:39.765 --> 36:42.299
assumed that there
would be instability.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.368
So before a regent could
officially be appointed,

36:45.370 --> 36:47.837
they plotted your
assassination.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.907
He was telling
the truth all along.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.711
Would you like us

36:54.713 --> 36:56.947
to keep the prisoner
in the dungeons?

36:56.949 --> 36:59.382
Is there any more information
you can get out of him?

36:59.384 --> 37:01.251
No.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.655
Then hang him.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.260
You'll set sail for England
within a few hours.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.329
I must face Elizabeth

37:12.331 --> 37:14.264
and tell her what happened
with the peace accord.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.733
I don't imagine the queen
will be too pleased.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.269
Mary will never sign
the accord now.

37:19.271 --> 37:22.305
Although, perhaps
things can still work

37:22.307 --> 37:24.274
in Elizabeth's favor
if she moves quickly.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.410
Francis' death leaves Mary
alone and vulnerable.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.547
There's nothing our queen
likes more than an easy target.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.749
¶ ¶

37:34.353 --> 37:36.753
I'm hoping that when I'm back...

37:36.755 --> 37:38.288
we can discuss

37:38.290 --> 37:40.490
your possible
return to court.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.858
I have no intention of staying.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.560
I need you,
Nostradamus.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.696
All my energy must go
into the fight to become regent,

37:46.698 --> 37:47.897
and I can't do it alone.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.432
You won't be.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.735
I can offer you
one final prophecy.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.671
Only with the queen of Scots'
help will you rule France.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.743
Good luck.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.845
Long life...
God willing, Catherine.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.583
¶ ¶

38:23.802 --> 38:25.001
GUARD:
Your Majesty...

38:25.003 --> 38:26.336
it's customary
for the queen of France

38:26.338 --> 38:27.604
to ride in
the first carriage.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.547
I'm no longer
the queen of France.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.049
¶ ¶

39:01.707 --> 39:03.840
(door opens)

39:11.983 --> 39:14.417
Leave us.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.398
This no longer belongs to me.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.780
I thought

39:43.782 --> 39:45.582
I wanted this back.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.851
Perhaps you were right
to hate me.

39:47.853 --> 39:51.554
Nostradamus was
right all along.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.157
I brought Francis' death,
just like he predicted.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.393
Your son

39:56.395 --> 39:58.561
died saving me,

39:58.563 --> 40:00.997
and if I could
do it all again,

40:00.999 --> 40:03.733
I would give anything

40:03.735 --> 40:05.135
that he may live.

40:06.671 --> 40:09.472
I'm so sorry, Catherine.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.042
I don't blame you, child.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.078
Francis was
his own man,

40:15.080 --> 40:16.613
who made
his own choices.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.716
Long ago, he chose to love you.

40:19.718 --> 40:22.051
I see you

40:22.053 --> 40:24.554
as children so clearly now,

40:24.556 --> 40:25.889
as if it was yesterday.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.691

40:31.797 --> 40:33.096
(laughing)

40:40.138 --> 40:42.472
Your love...

40:42.474 --> 40:43.973
it gave him so much joy.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.475
And that is what
you must remember

40:45.477 --> 40:46.743
as you move ahead
in this life.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.014
Move ahead?

40:51.016 --> 40:53.216
I don't know how.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.618
I'm confident
that you will find a way.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.120
Maybe not today or tomorrow,

40:57.122 --> 40:59.088
but you will, Mary.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.890
You are so strong.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.726
So strong.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.728
