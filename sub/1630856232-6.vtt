with the two ladies

20:17.175 --> 20:19.344

20:19.386 --> 20:21.304
The beginning was
just a little shaky,

20:21.346 --> 20:22.722
but I think the back half

20:22.764 --> 20:24.724
of the performance
was just so good,

20:24.766 --> 20:26.726
and it all came together.
I felt like you might have

20:26.768 --> 20:28.603
worked through whatever nerves
you were feeling.

you have as a vocalist.

I heard country,

great quality voice,

just what I like
to listen to.

20:39.823 --> 20:43.410

in the music industry,

coaches in my career,

with some of the things

so sweet to teach me.

We are.

that has such raw talent

It's just, how do you
put that all together?

21:09.811 --> 21:13.273
You need a coach that can
help you and cheerlead for you

21:13.314 --> 21:14.941
and bounce off of you
with ideas.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.944

39:08.973 --> 39:10.684
I feel like I have
so much to offer

39:10.725 --> 39:12.727
as far as sharing
that information with people.

39:12.769 --> 39:15.480
So I'm really pitching hard
right here.

39:15.522 --> 39:19.651
I got John. I'm like, "Ohh!"
So frustrating.

39:19.693 --> 39:21.361
It's very convincing,
though, honestly.

39:21.403 --> 39:23.780
It's good.
Is it? Oh, good. Okay.
I'm gonna keep going.

39:23.822 --> 39:27.826
Think about doing
something different today...

39:27.867 --> 39:31.246
with a coach that cares more
than any of the other coaches.

39:31.287 --> 39:34.165
[ Laughter ]

39:34.207 --> 39:35.959
The ease at which you sing

39:36.001 --> 39:38.712
is just so beautiful,
and the most humble,

39:38.753 --> 39:41.006
down-to-earth, smiley way
that you could possibly do it.

39:41.047 --> 39:42.799
It was so like --
That's so true.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.676
I was just watching you
while they were talking to you,

39:44.718 --> 39:47.595
and I was like, "This
is the nicest person
I've ever met in my life,

39:47.637 --> 39:50.098
and I haven't even
said hello properly yet."

39:50.140 --> 39:51.933
I definitely, 100%

39:51.975 --> 39:54.644
do not have a singer like you
on my team.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.771
It would be an honor
to coach someone as unique

39:56.813 --> 39:59.774
and authentic as you.
Thank you.

39:59.816 --> 40:05.113
Caleb, your voice made me
feel such peace inside.

40:05.155 --> 40:07.115
I did a duet album
many years ago,

40:07.157 --> 40:09.993
and I promise you,
if I'd have heard your voice,

40:10.035 --> 40:13.079
I would have begged you to
please come sing a duet with me.

40:13.121 --> 40:15.790
I love your voice, and
I'd love to be your coach.

40:15.832 --> 40:17.959
What's crazy is I grew up
watching you on TV.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.085
I love you.
Did you?

40:19.127 --> 40:21.963
Aww. Thank you so much.
Yay!

40:22.005 --> 40:25.550
Caleb, who do you choose
as your coach?

40:25.592 --> 40:27.969
[ Audience shouting ]

40:28.011 --> 40:29.429
Please.

40:32.182 --> 40:33.850
Who's he gonna pick?
I don't know.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.853
Maybe Gwen. Maybe Reba.
Maybe Niall.
...Reba.

40:36.895 --> 40:39.397
Y'all have made this
really hard. [ Laughs ]

40:43.860 --> 40:47.822
Um, I love all of you guys.
You guys are all amazing.

40:47.864 --> 40:49.366
I think I'm gonna
have to go with John.

40:49.407 --> 40:52.369
Yes! Yes!

40:52.410 --> 40:54.829
* You're special *

40:54.871 --> 40:56.581
* In case nobody
made you believe *

40:56.623 --> 40:57.874
Ow.

40:57.916 --> 40:59.250
* You're special *

40:59.292 --> 41:00.835
My man.
I'm such a fan.

41:00.877 --> 41:03.046
Yes. Thank you so much.
I'm a fan of younow.

41:03.088 --> 41:06.633
Caleb is a perfect addition
to Team Legend.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.344
What a beautiful, rich
tenor voice.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.888
He makes really musical
and tasteful choices

41:11.930 --> 41:15.058
with the way he does runs
and the way he styles a song.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.185
That's the kind of artist
I love to work with.

41:17.227 --> 41:19.646
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
You too. Thank you.

41:19.688 --> 41:20.980
We're so excited
to have him.

41:21.022 --> 41:22.691
You're gonna be great.
Thank you so much.

41:22.732 --> 41:24.067
I love your energy.
It's just like --

41:24.109 --> 41:25.944
You're just so peaceful, man.
[ Laughs ]

41:25.985 --> 41:27.862
I think
we're losers, guys.

41:27.904 --> 41:30.115
Yep. I think we've just
officially lost the thing.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.366
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:31.408 --> 41:34.703
[ Cheers and applause ]

41:34.744 --> 41:36.663
Niall: John Legend
made an amazing pitch,

41:36.705 --> 41:38.206
and Caleb was
a big fan of John's,

41:38.248 --> 41:40.709
and that was tough
to pitch against.

41:40.750 --> 41:43.294
The four-chair king returns.

41:43.336 --> 41:45.255
Yes!

41:45.296 --> 41:48.216
John's doing incredible,
and it's so annoying.

41:48.258 --> 41:51.219
I'm back! I'm back.
No, no, no, no, no!

41:51.261 --> 41:54.889
If John makes a mistake,
Caleb will end up on Team Gwen.

41:54.931 --> 41:56.683

41:56.725 --> 41:57.976
He's particularly good.

because of you *
