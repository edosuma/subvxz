Hey.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.431
[grunts]
Hey.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.852
God, you wake up
looking even better

00:18.935 --> 00:20.186
than when you went to sleep.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.397
[chuckles]
Do I?

00:24.733 --> 00:27.235
I can't believe we finally
slept together.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.778
Yeah.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.448
You do know, sometimes
when people sleep together

00:31.531 --> 00:34.492
they do more than sleep.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.952
Yup.

00:36.035 --> 00:39.038
Just remember, good things
come to those who wait.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
And wait and wait and wait.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.294
Vince, I told you

00:44.377 --> 00:46.921
when I'm ready
you'll be the first to know.

00:57.056 --> 00:58.933
Okay.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.518
Where are you going?

01:00.602 --> 01:04.230
I'm gonna go take a cold,
uh...ocean.

[instrumental music]

01:32.091 --> 01:33.802
- Get up!
- Aah!

01:35.762 --> 01:39.140
Oh. Oh, hey.
Good morning, baby.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.017
Annulment papers.
Remember? Sign.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, girl.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.729
You, you really want
this marriage to end?

01:44.813 --> 01:46.064
You haven't even experienced

01:46.147 --> 01:48.399
Vic's special
breakfast frittata yet.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.569
Yeah, hey, look,
I sat up all night

01:51.653 --> 01:53.321
waiting for you
to sign these papers, so..

01:53.404 --> 01:55.114
- You didn't sit up all night.
- Yeah, I did.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.699
- You didn't sleep at all?
- Okay.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.869
Well, yeah, maybe I dozed off
here and there but..

01:59.953 --> 02:02.747
So you're comfortable
enough to doze with me.

02:04.123 --> 02:06.793
That's beautiful, baby.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.044
[phone ringing]

02:09.127 --> 02:11.339
- Oh, God, it's Holly.
- Oh, it's Holly?

02:11.422 --> 02:13.675
Hey, you know what, she is gonna
be so excited we got married.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.718
- Uh, let me say hi.
- No.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.345
No, and I can't say hi either

02:17.428 --> 02:20.515
because she will sense in
my hi that something is wrong

02:20.598 --> 02:24.561
terribly, terribly wrong,
like we got married.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.313
Ooh, look at you. You're all
feisty in the morning.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
I like that.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.526
Stop liking me.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.862
Okay, look.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.739
Here you go. Just, please,
make you go away.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.157
Right there.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.451
I can't, "V."

02:40.535 --> 02:43.580
No, do not go having cute
little nicknames for me.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.708
Okay... my little Valerina.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.586
You know what, Fine.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.421
If you're not gonna sign
the papers, then just leave.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.506
Well, I kind of
can't do that, either.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.843
Yeah, you can. Remember
how you came in? Reverse it.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.929
Look, Val, what can I say?

03:00.013 --> 03:03.933
I mean, marriage is very
important to me, okay?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.394
My mom and dad have been
married for 42 years.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.022
My grandma and grandpa,
68 years.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.315
'And they're still in love.'

03:10.398 --> 03:12.233
Val, I wouldn't have married you

03:12.317 --> 03:14.110
if I wasn't sure
you were the girl

03:14.193 --> 03:16.571
I could spend
the rest of my life with.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.034
That is very sweet,
Vic. Really.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.786
But, uh, you see,
people don't just

03:23.870 --> 03:25.747
get married after one night.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.874
They meet, they date, they woo.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.501
Okay, well, well, we can date.
What are you doing tonight?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.629
You want to woo?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.964
No, no, yeah, yeah.
See, that's not how it works.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.467
'Cause you've got to pick me up
from elsewhere

03:37.550 --> 03:38.927
which means you've got
to go elsewhere.

- I love you.

but I gotta go back to work

05:07.265 --> 05:08.766
and you're gonna
miss your flight.

I'll miss my flight more.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.107
- Bye.
- Bye more.

So, since I've been gone, I've
been doing a little thinking.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.619
And we're gonna be
apart for three months.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.122

gonna be exclusive?

Nobody else?

05:48.222 --> 05:49.140
Nobody else.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.266
As far as us calling
each other--

05:50.349 --> 05:51.684
I'll call you every day.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.187
- That will work.
- There you go.

insecure or anything

06:14.373 --> 06:17.668

06:17.752 --> 06:21.130
Holly, I'm gonna think
about you every second.

At times, it may be tough,
but I know our love is deep.

It knows no distance.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.597
Yes, the days are gonna
go on forever

06:29.680 --> 06:30.973
and the nights even longer.

- At times, I may cry.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

a little too attached.

it had an air-conditioner.

go ahead and use all you want.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.594
Gary, you left without
locking the front door.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.388
I mean, if you're not gonna
protect me from the prowler

07:10.471 --> 07:12.348
you may as well, just move
back to your place.

07:12.431 --> 07:16.102
No, no, no. I-I mean, Tina..

07:16.185 --> 07:18.771
I locked the front door.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.523
What?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.817
Oh, God, you can't move out.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.528
That's what I thought.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.864
So now he won't sign
the annulment papers

07:27.947 --> 07:29.699
and he won't leave my apartment.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.909
He slept on the couch
all night long.

I'm saying, aren't you?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.970
Mm-hmm.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.889
Then help me.
How do I get Vic to leave?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.682
Oh, is Gary telling you
about the prowler?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.976
- How creepy is that?
- What prowler?

07:57.059 --> 07:59.770
Um, the one that they're not
writing about in the paper

07:59.854 --> 08:01.898
'cause it was, it was scaring
the readers too much.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.651
Yeah. yeah this guy cuts off
the electricity in the building.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.237
And with this heat wave,
the tenants are forced to leave

08:08.321 --> 08:09.530
and that's when he strikes.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.491
He's stolen, like,
millions of dollars.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.410
- That is genius.
- Yeah, I know.

08:14.493 --> 08:17.163
Forget about a doctor.
I want to marry a prowler.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.542
- No. I'm gonna sweat him out.
- Hey, what are you doing?

08:21.626 --> 08:24.587
I'm calling Con Ed and having
my electricity turned off.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.255
It's perfect.
He'll be in the apartment.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.758
It'll be, like, 900 degrees.
He'll get all hot and sweaty.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.510
And all hairy. Remember,
you said he's hairy.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.181
He won't be able to take it.
That boy is gonna bake.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.765
He'll be out of there
by tonight.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.644
Hey, he didn't have hair
on his back, did he?

08:39.727 --> 08:42.145
'Cause I like that, too.

Okay, the coast is clear, Tina.
You can come out.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.453
There's no prowler.

08:57.536 --> 09:00.706
Now we can leave safely
for our facials.

- Hey, I'm home!
- Holly!

So all the whining's over.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.263
Wait, he didn't come
back with you, did he?

09:15.346 --> 09:17.515
No. We're gonna be apart
for three months.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.475
Oh, it's gonna be so sad.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.018

No. No, no, no.
I am not gonna go there.

I trust what Vince and I have.
We are in love.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.318
And he's gonna call me every
day, 'cause we're exclusive.

It knows no distance.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.408
Ooh, I'm sure it doesn't.
Okay, now, let's hang out later.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.493
Because right now I'm treating
Gary to a spa day

09:37.576 --> 09:38.786
because he's been so nice to me.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.705
- Oh. Gary?
- Yeah.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.206
Well, there's a prowler
in the neighborhood

09:42.290 --> 09:44.000
so Gary's staying with me
until he's caught.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.918
- Wait, what? There's a prowler?
- Oh, well, don't worry.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.879
He, uh, he only turns
off your electricity

09:48.963 --> 09:50.673
and he waits till
everyone's gone

09:50.756 --> 09:52.675
and then he steals
all your good stuff.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.343
He doesn't hurt anybody.

hurt anybody--

your doors.

swallow a whole moon pie.

It's like a snake eating a rat.

- So answer it.
- No, I can't.

want her to know about Vic.

- Here, you take it.
- Okay.

How you doing?

11:04.121 --> 11:05.748
Oh, thank God she's okay.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.042
Well, of course she's okay.
Why wouldn't she be okay?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.419
Nothing crazy happened at all
while you were gone.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.255
Because I just got home and
there's a prowler in the loft

11:13.339 --> 11:14.965
and I might have killed him.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.300
Hey, good news, Val.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.261
Holly might have
just killed your husband.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.429
What?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.515
Nothing. Bye-bye.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.105
[instrumental music]

11:30.523 --> 11:34.819
Married? I go away for 24 hours
and you have a husband?

11:34.902 --> 11:36.695
Now, Holly..

11:36.779 --> 11:39.698
I know it sounds irresponsible
but try to understand.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.159
I was drunk.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.995
And what about you? You went to
Florida without telling anybody.

11:45.079 --> 11:49.667
Huh, let's see. A weekend away,
a descent into hell.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.003
Okay, come on. So back to Vince.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.297
Florida, loves you,
tearful goodbye.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.425
Okay, so how many times
has he called you already?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.969
Lauren, not now.
I'm dealing with Val.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.721
Oh, God. He hasn't called yet?

12:02.805 --> 12:04.640
No, I'm sure it's fine.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.100
It is fine, okay?

12:06.183 --> 12:09.145
Now, what are we gonna
do about Drunkie?

12:09.228 --> 12:11.355
Jeez! One night of booze
and then getting married

12:11.439 --> 12:14.608
and everybody's
all up in my grill.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.777
You know what, maybe
he sent you a text message.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.572
Vince loves you way too much
to ignore you so soon.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.782
[phone beeping]

12:21.866 --> 12:23.492
Oh, boy.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.869
What is your problem?

12:24.952 --> 12:28.122
Vince said he would call today.
It's still today.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.623
Okay, now, come on, Val.
Let's go.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.292
No, no, we can't,
not until Vic leaves.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.003
- And when is that gonna be?
- Very soon.

12:34.086 --> 12:38.048
I turned the electricity off.
I'm sweating him out. Ha!

12:38.132 --> 12:41.719
Val, he's a fireman.
He's good with heat.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.348
Right.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.143
Okay, so back to Vince.

12:49.226 --> 12:52.229
I am sure it's as simple as his
phone slipped out his pocket

12:52.313 --> 12:54.690
fell into a swamp
and a gator got it.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.942
Lauren! Vince will call!

12:57.026 --> 12:58.903
He will want to make sure
that I got in safely.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.864
I mean, I only landed..

13:01.947 --> 13:05.034
...four hours ago.

13:05.117 --> 13:09.788
Okay, now, don't you go
to that place, girlfriend.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.957
He loves you and you love him.

13:12.041 --> 13:16.420
You two have a real love,
not a drunk love like hers.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.589
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.050
W-what if Vic never leaves?

13:21.133 --> 13:24.553
What is happening to you?
Will you calm down?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.514
There are other ways
to get him out.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.432
No, Holly,
I have tried everything.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.392
I-I begged. I reasoned.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.686
I even called the police
but they all know him

13:32.770 --> 13:35.064
and they congratulated me.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.233
And, Holly,
we are legally married.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.194
That son-of-a-bitch fireman's
never gonna leave.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.196
Will you pull yourself together?

13:42.279 --> 13:44.448
You do not want some guy
to destroy your life.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.159
Now, give me the papers,
I'll get Vic to sign

13:47.243 --> 13:48.661
and, as for Vince

13:48.744 --> 13:50.829
I am glad that he doesn't
call me every two seconds.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.707
I am not one of those clingy
girls.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.335
Shut up! It's him!

13:56.418 --> 14:00.506
- Hello.
- Hello, angel girl.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.632
Lauren!

14:01.715 --> 14:03.050
Yeah, I was just
checking the line

14:03.133 --> 14:06.679
to make sure Vince
can get through.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.430
It's bad news, honey.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.642
[grunts]

14:18.816 --> 14:20.067
- Oh, hey, Holly.
- Hey, Vic.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.610
Thank you for meeting me here.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.779
I'm here to discuss the matter
of you and my sister.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.699
By the way, damn,
you're still smoking.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.077
And you. Look at you,
all grown up and so beautiful.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.162
Oh, really?
Ugh, I feel like hell.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.664
I've been in a relationship
all day

14:33.747 --> 14:36.125
and we already need counseling.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.210
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. Don't try to charm me.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.628
I'm here to discuss my sister.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.755
Oh. Hey, am I the luckiest guy
in the world or what?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.008
Enough chitchat, I need you
to sign these papers

14:44.091 --> 14:47.052
and then I need you to leave.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.846
- I can't.
- Mm-hmm, uh-huh, oh-ho.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.932
You can, and you're gonna
because, um...

14:52.016 --> 14:54.226
Let me tell you something
that you may not know.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.312
Val is a lesbian.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.110
Okay, um, Holly, let me tell
you something you don't know.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.946
I know Val is the one for me.
She knows it, too.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.949
She's just a little
slow on the uptake.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.284
Hey, listen to me, Vic.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.786
I learned a very important
lesson today.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.538
You can not make
someone love you.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.540
Sure, you have one
crazy night in Florida.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.625
Atlantic City.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.751
You get caught up
in the romance

15:18.834 --> 15:20.336
the palm trees, the pink sunset

15:20.419 --> 15:21.670
the beat of the salsa.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.464
Then, all of a sudden,
you kiss him goodbye

15:23.547 --> 15:25.049
you land at Kennedy,
he never calls you again

15:25.132 --> 15:28.969
and everything else
blows up in your face.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.137
You want to talk
about it, Holly?

15:30.220 --> 15:31.597
We're talking about you,
Vic, not me.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.642
Now, sign the damn papers.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.270
Holly, haven't you ever done
something without thinking

15:38.354 --> 15:40.981
because you knew in your gut
it was right?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.192
Yeah, pretty much everything.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.237
Well, you see, every now
and then, my gut is so strong

15:47.321 --> 15:49.031
that I have to listen to it.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.367
And the night I laid eyes
on your sister again

15:51.450 --> 15:55.162
my gut was screaming,
"Don't let her go."

15:55.245 --> 15:58.374
But hers is screaming,
"Let me go!"

15:59.541 --> 16:01.877
That's why she can't
hear my gut.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.799
But you can.
You're a gut-follower.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.260
I mean, isn't that what
brought you to your crazy

16:10.344 --> 16:12.805
salsa-filled night in Florida?

16:12.888 --> 16:13.806
Maybe.

16:13.889 --> 16:14.848
And I'm guessing it was

16:14.932 --> 16:16.141
a pretty incredible night.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.394
Oh, it was the most amazing
night I ever had.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.605
It was the most amazing kiss
I ever had

16:21.689 --> 16:25.109
the most amazing feeling
I have ever had.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.360
And if you didn't
follow your gut

16:26.443 --> 16:28.195
you never would have
had that night.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.658
I don't want to miss my night
in Florida, Holly.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.076
Do you want your sister
to miss hers?

16:34.159 --> 16:37.037
No! I mean, I want her
to have everything.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.373
So do I. That is why
I can't sign these papers.

16:39.456 --> 16:42.000
And you shouldn't! I don't want
Val to miss her chance.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.211
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, man.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.922
She is so lucky to have you.
Don't you give up, Vic.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.507
Oh, I won't.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.926
I won't, Holly.
Thank you for talking to me.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.178
And can I just say

16:53.262 --> 16:55.097
if you want to talk to this guy
just call him.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.057
No, I can't. It's so pushy.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.811
It's one of those girl
qualities that guys hate.

17:00.894 --> 17:04.857
Well, I got to tell you
if a girl like you called me

17:04.940 --> 17:06.608
I'd be thrilled.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.654
Val is such a fool.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.204
Vince, you answered.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.959
Holly.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.294
You know, the girl who woke up

17:25.377 --> 17:29.131
in your arms on
the beach this morning.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.550
Listen...I know you're busy

17:31.633 --> 17:35.596
and I know you're surrounded by
beautiful women and it's okay.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.806
I mean, if you forget to call..

17:38.766 --> 17:40.017
- Vince!
- Hey, baby.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.894
Hey! Oh.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.228
What are you..

17:46.774 --> 17:48.859
...doing here?

17:48.942 --> 17:51.028
How could I go three months
without you?

17:51.111 --> 17:53.113
I missed you the second
you walked out the door.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.574
Holly, we've waited so long
to be together there was no way

17:55.657 --> 17:58.827
I was gonna go another day
without my baby girl.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.412
I'm your baby girl?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.498
I'm your baby girl more.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.920
Oh, my damn.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.714
Vince is home early,
three months early!

18:12.591 --> 18:13.967
Vince!

18:14.051 --> 18:15.844
Yeah, yeah, well, what
the hell are you doing home

18:15.928 --> 18:19.681
three months early? You didn't
go to the apartment, did you?

18:19.765 --> 18:20.974
No, I came straight here.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.601
Oh, so you didn't go
to the apartment.

18:22.684 --> 18:28.065
Good, good. You know, 'cause,
um, w-w-we got bugs.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.818
'Yeah, so I've been staying
with Tina at her place'

18:30.901 --> 18:33.362
because there's a prowler loose,
and I thought that "Hey.."

18:33.445 --> 18:34.530
You know, wouldn't this
be a good time

18:34.613 --> 18:36.073
to have an exterminator
at our place?"

18:36.156 --> 18:38.075
You know, for the critters.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.203
It's okay. You can stay with us.
My loft is huge.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.747
With a ja-kwa-zee.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.499
That would be perfect.

18:45.582 --> 18:49.378
We'll be right across the hall,
just like Ross and Rachel.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.132
He got to do the chores.
Can't nobody stay for free.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.179
[instrumental music]

19:05.018 --> 19:08.146
He's gone. Oh, he's gone.
Thank you. I love you.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.400
Oh, I love you, too.
Oh, but I am super tired.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.943
So I'm gonna get
some shut-eye. Night!

19:13.026 --> 19:14.903
No! Wait, wait, wait!
What happened?

19:14.987 --> 19:18.031
Oh, Vince missed me so much
that he came back from Florida.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.534
That's why he didn't call. He
was on the plane the whole time.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.996
See? You were all worried
for nothing. Night!

19:24.079 --> 19:25.622
No, no, no! Wait!

19:25.706 --> 19:27.291
Holly, I am so happy for us.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.168
You are in a relationship
and I am out of one.

19:32.212 --> 19:37.926
Wait...w-w-what's
with that face?

19:38.010 --> 19:43.098
Holly...where are my signed
annulment papers?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.851
Val, you are gonna
have to start learning

19:45.934 --> 19:49.771
how to trust in relationships.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.274
What the hell's going on?
What happened with Vic?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.359
What did you say to him?
What did he say to you?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.528
I want my papers. Where is Vic?

19:56.612 --> 20:00.908
Hey, honey. I picked up some
raisin bran. We were out.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.620
The son-of-a-bitch fireman
bought raisin bran.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.496
We did need raisin bran.

20:09.207 --> 20:13.837
Uh...y-y-you do understand that
unless you sign these papers

20:13.921 --> 20:16.882
it is gonna take six months
to end this marriage?

20:16.965 --> 20:19.801
I'll tell you what, in six
months if you don't love me

20:19.885 --> 20:22.137
but you will, I will leave.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.972
You are out of your mind.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.351
(Holly)
'Come on! Let yourself love!
Take the deal.'

20:29.770 --> 20:31.230
Just a minute.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.945
