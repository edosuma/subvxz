-For now.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.326
Hey loser, Shashi wants to talk.
He's across town.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.786
He could have called.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.914
He could have, but...
Where's the fun in that?

01:59.035 --> 02:00.328
I win. Again.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.957
You're welcome. I know you felt bad
after I had to save you.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.669
-You didn't have to save me!
-Enough! You're exactly the same.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.087
-What?
-He wishes.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.505
I have a job for you.

02:10.588 --> 02:14.134
Meet Sudarikov. A Russian oligarch
and high-end arms dealer.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.969
You buy weapons from him?

02:16.052 --> 02:19.430
The weapons he sells
are a bit old-fashioned for my taste.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.224
I'm looking to buy codes.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.767
Like nuclear codes?

02:22.851 --> 02:25.478
Stop asking stupid questions.
Let him finish.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.815
Not nukes. These codes are
much more valuable than that.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.901
Which is why I know
Sudarikov won't sell them to me.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.404
-So--
-[Shashi] That's where you come in.

02:34.487 --> 02:39.367
While I distract him, you steal the codes
from his high-security suite. Up for it?

02:39.742 --> 02:41.953
[chuckles] My crew's up for anything.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.664
Forget your crew.
You do this job with Layla.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.166
-What?
-Gross!

02:46.833 --> 02:48.710

02:54.215 --> 02:56.509
Fun. I'll send you the details later.

02:56.885 --> 02:57.969
[both grunt]

03:03.141 --> 03:06.561
I've done a million jobs.
Why do I need Deadweight Toretto?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.521
This one is different, a test.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.441
We need to make sure
Tony is someone I can trust.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.197
Then Shashi said
he wants me and Layla to steal

03:18.281 --> 03:20.408
from this guy's high-security suite.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.119
No one else knows
about this top secret plan.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.788
Whoa. That's some crazy trust fall stuff.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.585
Right? And since we're going to know
Shashi's whereabouts for the entire night,

03:30.668 --> 03:34.797
it's the perfect opportunity
to use our data to infiltrate his hideout.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.550
Gary, show us the blueprint
of Shashi's house.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.512
Those feet got an off switch?

03:41.596 --> 03:45.016

from hitting my daily goal,

03:45.099 --> 03:46.976
so haters, back off.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.607
We tracked the drone you planted
on the train car back to Shashi's crib.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.985
Is "crib" still a popular term
in your peer group?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.862
Uh... You can't pull it off.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.741
We're looking for a link between
the people Shashi has robbed.

04:01.824 --> 04:06.913
We think the keys and whatever else Shashi
has stolen is likely stashed in his house.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.624
-What are the keys again?
-We're finding out.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.502
While Tony works
with Layla and Shashi, you...

04:12.877 --> 04:15.213
Wait, we're missing someone here.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.091
Where's the kid?
Name sounds like an ice cream?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.635
Frostee!

04:20.969 --> 04:24.722
-I'm working!
-No you're not. That's why she's yelling.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.767
[sniffs] That stinks. What are you making?

04:27.850 --> 04:31.562
A portal into another dimension
where it's quiet.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.357
Why are you so weird?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.609
-You missed a spot.
-Oh yeah! Thanks.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.738
What's that smell? Wanda,
have you been messing with the curry?

04:40.822 --> 04:43.199
That's our son stinking up the joint.

04:43.574 --> 04:47.495

working but he didn't listen.

could cut the service time here in half.

but I have good news.

-"And science."
-So how long is this science camp?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.265
All day, every day, for the entire summer.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.727
You won't see much of him as
he'll be busy learning stuff,

05:52.810 --> 05:54.896
building tech, and making memories.

slams into the ground creating a tremor.

-Or hear us?

we don't have much time.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.355
This floor is occupied by Sudarikov.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.483
The codes may be housed
in some kind of USB or CPU.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.449
Whoa-ho-ho. A screen-quarium!

You need to focus and-- What?

Whoa! Is that an original Ang Chen?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.195
-Whoa!
- Hey! Focus.

10:54.654 --> 10:59.408
The tectonic imaging from our earthquake
shows a vault under the infrastructure.

Check out the rock on that bird!

11:28.270 --> 11:31.607
Huh. Reminds me of my aunt's parakeet,
minus the bling.

Do you always talk this much?

Then, my cousin Dom
ran back in to save that bird.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.454
"Leave no family behind."
That's the Toretto motto.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
Well, a bird's not family.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.460
-Now a dog, that's family.
-What kind of dog do you have?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.756
Just trying to get to know you.
Paranoid much?

11:55.840 --> 11:59.969
If you haven't noticed, I'm kind of
a lone wolf, shadowy criminal type,

12:00.052 --> 12:04.181
not a baby riding on his cousin's
coattails talking about his family.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.684
-Let's move. This isn't the room.
-Ouch.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.728
Family is important.
You need people you can trust.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.356
Family slows you down,
trust is for suckers.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.526
-They'll be in a secure location.
-[Echo]  Hold up.

12:15.609 --> 12:16.444

-What?

12:16.527 --> 12:17.445
-What?
-Huh?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.488
I wasn't talking to you.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.824
-Were you talking to me?
-Um...

12:22.366 --> 12:24.952
Uh, I, I was. Did you say something?

12:25.035 --> 12:26.745
-[both] Are you okay?
-Er...

12:26.829 --> 12:30.416
Everything's fine.
Let's just keep doing what we're doing.

[music fades]

12:55.733 --> 12:58.694
[Tony] It knows if the codes
are in the computers?

12:58.777 --> 13:02.364
It scans the servers for encryption
that may hide the codes.

are in these computers?

Mm-mm-mm. Check out the awesome cars!

13:15.085 --> 13:17.755
I'm checking them and I like what I see.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.965
Forget the cars. Find the keys.

I thought you came to make a deal.

But now I must check Sova.
This tête-à-tête is  finito .

14:17.106 --> 14:18.774
I have to ask you something.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.985
Isn't that thing hot?

14:22.027 --> 14:26.866
Eh. It's signature look.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.835
You can store a crazy amount of data
in crystals now.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.380
-Data crystals, that's it! Genius!
-Who are you talking to?

14:41.463 --> 14:43.841
Er, myself! I know where the codes are.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.134
[Tony] We need this.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.678
Hey! What are you talking about?

14:47.761 --> 14:51.223
See the bling on that owl?
The codes could be stored there.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.267
We've got to go back and get it.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.353
[Shashi]  Guys, abort.
Sudarikov is headed your way.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.981
You don't know if the data's there.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.901
We can get in and out
before Sudarikov returns.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.654
What's this "we" business?
You heard Shashi. I'm out of here.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.448
Fine. I don't need you.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.117
I'm gonna do what Torettos do best:
