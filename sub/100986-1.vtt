00:49.032 --> 00:51.299
All right, sleepy guy,
we're heading to school.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.668
Mm.

00:52.670 --> 00:53.736
I'm gonna be at the store
later.

00:53.738 --> 00:54.670
Can you pick me up there?

00:54.672 --> 00:57.407
Yes, does Anna have her
project ready?

00:57.409 --> 00:59.040
Uh huh, she was up at dawn

00:59.042 --> 01:00.610
putting on the finishing
touches.

01:00.612 --> 01:01.444
I wanna see it.

01:01.446 --> 01:02.712
Oh honey, she's already in the
car.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.078
She's waiting for me.

01:04.081 --> 01:04.947
Oh.

01:07.485 --> 01:10.053
All right, we're off.

01:11.523 --> 01:13.255
Have a wonderful day.

01:13.257 --> 01:14.990
Thank you, you too.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.627
Tell Anna that I can't wait to
hear about her presentation.

01:17.629 --> 01:18.929
She's gonna crush it.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.129
I will.

01:21.131 --> 01:21.997
Bye.

01:21.999 --> 01:22.698
Bye.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.601
Oh, Theo, you look great, hon.

01:25.603 --> 01:27.605
Okay, see you at 3:00,
my love.

01:42.554 --> 01:43.488
Mr. Avery?

01:55.165 --> 01:56.468
Sir, are you okay in there?

02:00.772 --> 02:03.273
Should probably go ahead
and get you down there now.

02:53.725 --> 02:57.325
Wow, I really appreciate you
calling, Mrs. Winters, I do.

02:57.327 --> 02:58.193
I really do.

02:58.195 --> 03:00.128
I just can't.

03:00.130 --> 03:05.135
I don't, I'm not sure, I
don't know what to say is all.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.573
I would really appreciate that.

03:10.575 --> 03:12.340
I would uh, yes,

03:12.342 --> 03:14.877
I would love it if the school
did something for Anna.

03:14.879 --> 03:16.414
She loved it there.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.486
Yes, no, it's just I just, I,

03:22.520 --> 03:23.588
I just, I can't.

03:25.657 --> 03:26.524
Yes.

03:27.759 --> 03:30.361
Yes, yes, I will stay in touch.

03:31.763 --> 03:36.066
Yes, I'm sorry, I just
have a lot of think about.

03:38.736 --> 03:39.604
Yes.

03:40.738 --> 03:42.373
Okay, thank you.

03:43.608 --> 03:44.509
All right, bye.

04:59.484 --> 05:00.750
Ready go.

05:00.752 --> 05:03.318
Hi, please leave a message.

06:17.895 --> 06:20.230
Hey, Preston.

06:23.534 --> 06:24.402
Preston.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.302
Preston.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.039
Theo?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.510
Hey buddy, no, no, its me.

06:38.883 --> 06:39.884
Well it's,

06:42.353 --> 06:43.853
what are you doing here, Wes?

06:43.855 --> 06:44.887
I'm sorry I startled you.

06:44.889 --> 06:46.289
It's okay.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.660
- I heard...
- I um,

06:50.962 --> 06:52.663
I just couldn't sleep in there.

06:55.399 --> 06:56.768
Oh man, this is embarrassing.

06:58.369 --> 07:01.839
Wes: Hey, hey.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.377
I'm sure you haven't read the
paper,

07:08.379 --> 07:11.582
but um, there was a report this
morning.

07:12.483 --> 07:14.083
It's in the paper.

07:14.085 --> 07:17.622
The driver uh, of the other
um,

07:20.625 --> 07:24.061
he um, I guess
it wasn't even his first,

07:25.563 --> 07:27.363
he was just a kid.

07:27.365 --> 07:28.964
So what am I supposed to do?

07:28.966 --> 07:29.832
I never done this before.

07:29.834 --> 07:30.699
Am I supposed to call...

07:30.701 --> 07:32.036
Do you want me to handle
things?

07:35.773 --> 07:37.006
Anna's school called.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.140
Don't worry about any of
that.

07:38.142 --> 07:39.742
That stuff will all take care of
itself.

07:39.744 --> 07:42.144
Store, Gary.

07:42.146 --> 07:46.048
You should call Gary,
you need to talk to him.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.917
Don't worry about anything else.

07:47.919 --> 07:49.387
Right now, you just need to

07:50.788 --> 07:51.787
you know?

07:51.789 --> 07:54.890
You just need to take
care of you right now.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.625
It's gonna be okay.

07:56.627 --> 07:58.029
You're gonna get through this.

24:53.010 --> 24:53.843
Oh.

27:47.918 --> 27:48.786
Hey.

27:51.222 --> 27:52.223
Six bucks.

27:56.861 --> 27:59.261
Where are you headed?

27:59.263 --> 28:00.963
I don't know.

28:00.965 --> 28:01.830
I know how to get there

28:01.832 --> 28:04.902
if you don't know where you're
going.

28:06.737 --> 28:07.836
You want a bag?

28:07.838 --> 28:08.739
No, thanks.

28:09.874 --> 28:11.208
Ride safe.

35:52.069 --> 35:53.371
I like your bike.

35:58.108 --> 35:59.140
Huh?

35:59.142 --> 36:00.010
Your bike.

36:04.849 --> 36:06.316
Okay, have a good night.

36:08.085 --> 36:08.753
Yeah, okay.

36:41.318 --> 36:42.286
Shifter?

36:45.723 --> 36:46.591
Yeah.

36:48.359 --> 36:49.460
It's pretty bent.

36:50.528 --> 36:51.727
You know about bikes?

36:51.729 --> 36:53.896
Oh, I grew up around bikes.

36:53.898 --> 36:57.200
Oh.

36:57.969 --> 37:00.170
Hey, did you hear the wind
last night?

37:00.872 --> 37:02.038
Yeah.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.842
Kind of sounded like
somebody was screaming, right?

37:10.748 --> 37:13.214
Okay, well I'm gonna head up the
beach.

37:13.216 --> 37:14.719
Okay, see you later.

37:50.555 --> 37:53.358
All right sleepy
guy, we're heading to school.

37:54.692 --> 37:57.225
Does Anna
have her project ready?

37:57.227 --> 37:58.128
I wanna see it.

37:59.196 --> 38:00.261
Honey, she's already in the
car.

38:00.263 --> 38:01.731
She's waiting for me.

40:19.437 --> 40:20.270
Fuck!

40:26.577 --> 40:27.445
No!

40:30.715 --> 40:31.582
Fuck!

41:27.772 --> 41:28.706
Coffee?

41:33.077 --> 41:33.945
Uh,

41:35.746 --> 41:36.614
no.

41:38.015 --> 41:38.883
Okay.

41:41.452 --> 41:43.452
Oh you know what, yes.

41:43.454 --> 41:45.020
I'm sorry, coffee.

41:45.022 --> 41:45.921
All right.

41:45.923 --> 41:46.791
Thank you.

41:54.165 --> 41:55.798
Thanks.

41:55.800 --> 42:00.169
Sorry, I've just been um,

42:00.171 --> 42:01.971
It's okay.

42:01.973 --> 42:05.574
No, just that water can get
pretty cold this early, so.

42:05.576 --> 42:06.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:07.745 --> 42:10.679
Well, I've got um, some more
hot water

42:10.681 --> 42:11.947
and some coffee and stuff,

42:11.949 --> 42:14.083
if you wanna sit, if
you want some company.

42:14.085 --> 42:17.887
Or just bring the mug
back anytime, whenever.

42:17.889 --> 42:19.521
Okay, thank you.

42:19.523 --> 42:20.391
Yeah.

42:40.011 --> 42:40.945
Uh, hey,

42:42.146 --> 42:43.712
I have your mug.

42:43.714 --> 42:44.582
Okay.

42:47.251 --> 42:48.784
Should I get it?

42:48.786 --> 42:49.654
Sure.

43:01.132 --> 43:01.999
Thanks.

43:03.534 --> 43:05.601
Um, thank you for the gesture.

43:05.603 --> 43:07.169
Oh, no gesture, just warmth.

43:07.171 --> 43:09.006
Oh well, thank you.

43:10.541 --> 43:12.708
They have what you were
looking for over there?

43:12.710 --> 43:14.877
Oh no, they, I need a tool.

43:14.879 --> 43:17.513
They don't have any tools in
there, so.

43:17.515 --> 43:19.048
Is your motorcycle broken?

43:19.050 --> 43:21.684
Uh, I just dumped it in
the desert horsing around,

43:21.686 --> 43:24.155
bent the shifter and it's
hard to get into gear, so.

43:27.858 --> 43:30.795
Well, I gotta head into town
today so if you want a ride.

43:33.064 --> 43:33.931
Okay.

43:34.899 --> 43:35.831
Yeah.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.933
All right, thank you.

44:37.862 --> 44:39.530
Got what you needed?

44:40.698 --> 44:42.833
Think so, it's worth a shot.

44:45.669 --> 44:48.139
I'm Tracey by the way,
in case you were wondering.

44:50.775 --> 44:51.642
Huh?

44:53.044 --> 44:56.147
Oh my God, right.

44:57.382 --> 44:58.981
Right.

44:58.983 --> 45:00.115
Preston.

45:00.117 --> 45:01.652
Nice to meet you, Preston.

45:02.387 --> 45:03.254
Yikes.

45:04.755 --> 45:06.755
How long have you been on the
road?

45:06.757 --> 45:09.792
Um, a couple of weeks, maybe
more.

45:09.794 --> 45:11.962
I don't know, I haven't
really been keeping track.

45:14.932 --> 45:16.734
What are you running from,
Preston?

45:19.036 --> 45:20.035
Sorry?

45:20.037 --> 45:21.939
Relax.

45:23.107 --> 45:24.341
I'm just kidding with you.

45:27.678 --> 45:29.780
I do wanna ask you one thing,
though.

45:33.284 --> 45:35.152
Can I have a ride on your
motorcycle?

45:36.887 --> 45:39.422
Just a tiny little ride
around the campground.

45:40.091 --> 45:41.192
It would mean so much to me.

45:41.859 --> 45:44.929
You want a ride on my bike?

45:48.265 --> 45:49.932
Okay.

45:49.934 --> 45:51.401
Really?

45:51.403 --> 45:52.402
Yes!

45:52.404 --> 45:54.770
I mean, it seems like
it's the least I can do.

45:54.772 --> 45:56.307
You've given me a ride, after
all.

46:05.349 --> 46:07.049
Hey.

46:07.051 --> 46:07.916
Hey.

46:07.918 --> 46:10.853
So I think she's fixed if you
wanna...

46:10.855 --> 46:11.720
It's fixed?

46:11.722 --> 46:12.888
I think so.

46:12.890 --> 46:14.158
Yes, let's go.

46:15.326 --> 46:16.792
Oh, together?

46:16.794 --> 46:18.694
Oh, I was, I thought that maybe

46:18.696 --> 46:20.262
you could just ride around, you
know,

46:20.264 --> 46:21.230
I mean, I could show you.

46:21.232 --> 46:23.667
No, no, come on, let's
go for a real ride.

46:24.969 --> 46:25.870
You have to drive.

47:05.443 --> 47:07.178
Thank you for bringing me up
here.

47:08.480 --> 47:09.880
So fun.

47:11.315 --> 47:15.150
Look at this, all of this
is just happening, you know?

47:15.152 --> 47:16.153
Like, all the time.

47:17.054 --> 47:17.922
Man.

47:21.493 --> 47:23.892
Sorry, I'm gushing.

47:23.894 --> 47:27.365
I just get a little
excited, you know?

47:32.903 --> 47:35.139
What's your story, huh?

47:37.341 --> 47:39.341
You love this.

47:39.343 --> 47:42.144
You're so nice and likable.

47:42.146 --> 47:43.979
Why are you out here camping by
yourself?

47:43.981 --> 47:46.150
Why aren't you hanging
out with your people?

47:52.022 --> 47:54.225
I don't mind being alone.

47:54.959 --> 47:56.526
Beside, I could say the same
thing to you.

47:56.528 --> 47:58.394
No, I don't think so.

47:58.396 --> 48:01.029
I'm not very likable,
at least not these days.

48:01.031 --> 48:01.897
Oh you're not?

48:01.899 --> 48:02.766
No,

48:04.034 --> 48:04.902
no.

48:05.836 --> 48:06.504
I'm

48:17.582 --> 48:21.384
Listen, Preston, whatever
it is you're going through

48:21.386 --> 48:24.387
and I don't know what it
is and I don't need to,

48:24.389 --> 48:26.257
but it's obviously something for
you,

48:27.459 --> 48:29.359
it will pass.

48:29.361 --> 48:32.928
Things will get better if
you choose to let them.

48:32.930 --> 48:34.997
Just because this sunset is
fleeting,

48:34.999 --> 48:38.002
does it make the fact that it
happened any less beautiful?

48:39.069 --> 48:39.937
It shouldn't.

48:42.239 --> 48:45.040
I mean, when you see that
beauty,

48:45.042 --> 48:48.480
in and of itself, doesn't
actually care about us,

48:49.481 --> 48:51.915
yet we still get to look at it,

48:52.850 --> 48:54.452
we get to hold it and love it.

48:57.589 --> 48:58.456
I don't know.

49:02.293 --> 49:03.292
What a gift, you know?

49:03.294 --> 49:05.127
Why you saying all this?

49:05.129 --> 49:06.130
I mean, who are you?

49:09.333 --> 49:10.435
I'm just

49:14.204 --> 49:16.338
I'm the woman who's about
to take your photo right now

49:17.274 --> 49:18.641
and capture this beautiful
moment for you.

49:18.643 --> 49:19.341
No.

49:19.343 --> 49:22.378
And someday, you'll thank me.

49:22.380 --> 49:24.246
Come on, dude, let's lighten
things up a little bit...

49:24.248 --> 49:25.550
I'm not doing this, nope.

49:27.151 --> 49:29.419
Okay, give me some of that
rugged,

49:29.421 --> 49:31.855
loner on the cliff-side.

49:33.991 --> 49:37.161
Um, wait, hold on.

49:39.664 --> 49:41.063
Did you get it?

49:41.065 --> 49:42.130
I got it.

49:42.132 --> 49:44.099
Done, are you gonna take
this thing for a spin?

49:44.101 --> 49:45.601
You gonna ride this or not?

49:45.603 --> 49:48.571
Oh, well, it's been a while,
but yes,

49:48.573 --> 49:50.506
- I would.
- All right.

49:50.508 --> 49:52.007
- You gotta hold this.
- Okay,

49:52.009 --> 49:54.343
I'll hold that and take that,
good.

49:54.345 --> 49:55.346
There we go.

49:56.548 --> 49:57.948
Woo.

49:59.351 --> 50:01.517
Nice, here, gloves.

50:01.519 --> 50:03.285
Okay, gloves.

50:03.287 --> 50:04.487
Yeah, put those on.

50:04.489 --> 50:05.421
All right,

50:05.423 --> 50:06.556
just give me a little crash
course here.

50:06.558 --> 50:08.524
I will, don't say crash.

50:50.602 --> 50:53.736
Uh well, I think I should turn
in.

50:53.738 --> 50:56.506
Okay.

50:56.508 --> 50:58.306
Thanks, Preston.

50:58.308 --> 50:59.475
For what?

50:59.477 --> 51:02.177
I had a really good evening
with you.

51:02.179 --> 51:03.180
Me too, thank you.

51:04.248 --> 51:05.615
Oh hey, give me your number

51:05.617 --> 51:07.249
so I can send you these
pictures.

51:07.251 --> 51:09.217
Oh no, that's, that's okay.

51:09.219 --> 51:12.488
No, no, come on, I really
want you to have them.

51:12.490 --> 51:15.190
Okay, um, could you
just email 'em to me?

51:15.192 --> 51:16.759
I haven't turned my
cellphone on this whole time

51:16.761 --> 51:19.362
- and it's just...
- yeah.

51:19.364 --> 51:20.996
Uh, shoot.

51:20.998 --> 51:26.003
Okay, it's aver.p@gmail.com,
so A-V-E-R, dot,

51:26.270 --> 51:28.571
P as in Preston at gmail.com.

51:28.573 --> 51:31.607
Okay, they are headed your
way.

51:31.609 --> 51:32.708
All right, great.

51:32.710 --> 51:34.276
Thank you, goodnight.

51:34.278 --> 51:35.145
Night.

53:15.279 --> 53:18.681
Anna, Anna, oh,
there she is,

53:18.683 --> 53:22.618
Grandpa Gary, there's your
granddaughter.

53:22.620 --> 53:25.454
Anna, what are you doing?

53:25.456 --> 53:27.557
What are you doing, Anna?

53:27.559 --> 53:29.190
Texting someone?

53:29.192 --> 53:30.860
Who are you texting?

53:30.862 --> 53:33.462
Are you texting with a boy?

53:33.464 --> 53:34.664
Come on, dad, stop.

53:34.666 --> 53:38.199
Oh, is it possible
she's...

53:38.201 --> 53:39.802
Dad, please, you're
bothering me.

53:39.804 --> 53:40.770
Houston...

53:40.772 --> 53:42.905
Dad come on, I get an hour,
you said so.

53:42.907 --> 53:44.740
Can I please, just let me enjoy
it?

53:44.742 --> 53:47.779
What, huh,
this isn't fun for you?

53:49.179 --> 53:52.347
What, hey, where are you going?

55:07.392 --> 55:08.758
You headed out?

55:08.760 --> 55:09.627
Yeah.

55:10.695 --> 55:12.461
Cool, where you going?

55:12.463 --> 55:14.563
Yeah, you know, I don't really
know.

55:14.565 --> 55:15.767
Up North, I guess.

55:17.300 --> 55:18.333
Okay.

55:18.335 --> 55:20.469
What, is that okay with you?

55:20.471 --> 55:21.437
I don't even know you

55:21.439 --> 55:23.574
and seriously, what do
you care where I go?

55:25.376 --> 55:27.443
No, I was just gonna see if
you wanted to go for a hike,

55:27.445 --> 55:29.445
but you're headed out, so.

55:29.447 --> 55:31.849
Well bike's fixed,
don't need to be here.

55:33.751 --> 55:34.619
Okay.

55:36.554 --> 55:37.987
Take care of yourself, Preston.

55:37.989 --> 55:38.856
I will.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.039
Hey Doc, can I get another?

57:37.041 --> 57:38.709
Yeah.

57:40.444 --> 57:42.578
- There you go.
- Appreciate it, thanks.

57:59.997 --> 58:02.533
Yo, whiskey neat.

58:05.169 --> 58:06.268
Is he serious?

58:06.270 --> 58:08.537
It's fine, he's just
having a rough night is all.

58:08.539 --> 58:10.005
Well he's gonna be having
a lot harder of a night

58:10.007 --> 58:11.809
if he can't muster up some
manners.

58:13.711 --> 58:15.911
I'm sorry.

58:15.913 --> 58:16.981
Are you talking to me?

58:18.182 --> 58:19.717
What if I am talking to you?

58:21.118 --> 58:23.519
Look, I don't want
any trouble all right?

58:23.521 --> 58:24.520
You're just a kid.

58:24.522 --> 58:25.621
I'm just a kid?

58:25.623 --> 58:28.826
Look, if I said something
then I'm sorry, okay?

58:35.533 --> 58:37.066
Look, why don't you
just keep sucking 'em back

58:37.068 --> 58:39.635
and crying into your drink over
there

58:39.637 --> 58:41.103
and keep your fuckin' mouth
shut!

58:41.105 --> 58:42.738
Okay, that's enough.

58:42.740 --> 58:44.475
Just leave him alone, he's fine.

58:46.444 --> 58:47.643
You just gonna stare at
me now?

58:47.645 --> 58:49.914
Hey, I said that's enough.

58:51.215 --> 58:52.083
Go.

58:58.456 --> 58:59.724
Sorry, you're fine.

59:00.758 --> 59:01.626
My bad.

59:23.581 --> 59:25.848
All righty then, it's
time for this stallion

59:25.850 --> 59:27.549
to split it and hit it.

59:27.551 --> 59:29.251
Good night, darling.

59:29.253 --> 59:31.620
Thank you, as always.

59:31.622 --> 59:33.155
Are you okay to get yourself
home?

59:33.157 --> 59:34.025
Yes, I am.

59:34.959 --> 59:38.227
I should be able to make it
at least most of the way.

59:38.229 --> 59:39.762
Would you take him home?

59:39.764 --> 59:42.831
He's a big boy hon, I
ain't driving him nowhere.

59:42.833 --> 59:44.633
Yeah, I'm a big boy, darling.

59:44.635 --> 59:46.037
Someone just take him home.

59:47.939 --> 59:50.272
How can all of you people let
this idiot

59:50.274 --> 59:52.107
get behind the wheel of a car?

59:52.109 --> 59:54.643
Well look who's got something
to say?

59:54.645 --> 59:56.078
And who are you calling an
idiot?

59:56.080 --> 59:57.112
You.

59:58.182 --> 59:59.183
Just take my keys?

01:00:00.117 --> 01:00:01.283
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:04.019
You know, it's all fun and
games

01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.157
and nothing matters
until you kill someone.

01:00:06.924 --> 01:00:09.258
Until you go out there
and kill some beautiful,

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.594
innocent child who just wants
to get to school that day

01:00:12.596 --> 01:00:14.830
so that she can share her
homework

01:00:14.832 --> 01:00:17.199
of a class project, sustainable
farming

01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.734
for inner city neighborhoods

01:00:18.736 --> 01:00:21.537
that she's been working on so
hard

01:00:21.539 --> 01:00:24.106
and all she wants to do is help
people.

01:00:24.108 --> 01:00:25.142
And then there's you.

01:00:25.977 --> 01:00:28.479
What have you done for the
world, huh?

01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:33.048
You know, you should do
yourself a favor and just die.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:33.749
That way,

01:00:33.751 --> 01:00:34.384
you don't have to live with it.

01:00:34.386 --> 01:00:36.251
No, no, no, I'll do that.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:37.987
That'll be my job from now on.

01:00:37.989 --> 01:00:39.321
You come walking in here,

01:00:39.323 --> 01:00:41.657
killing brain cells
you don't have to spare

01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:44.226
and then go out there
killing daughters and mothers

01:00:44.228 --> 01:00:45.761
and ruining families...

01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:47.629
What the fuck are you
blabbering about,

01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:48.899
you fuckin' nut job?

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.633
Sh, sh, sh.

01:00:51.635 --> 01:00:55.037
You know, what you should
do is you should go

01:00:55.039 --> 01:00:58.307
get yourself a gun, put
the barrel in your mouth

01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:01.110
and pull the trigger and do the
whole fuckin' world a favor,

01:01:01.112 --> 01:01:03.779
you pathetic, worthless
waste of skin and...

01:02:29.033 --> 01:02:31.066
Hey buddy, you want your
credit card?

01:02:31.068 --> 01:02:33.902
Oh shit, you need some help,
pal.

01:02:33.904 --> 01:02:36.238
No, I'm okay, thanks.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.906
Yeah, you look it.

01:02:37.908 --> 01:02:39.442
I'm okay, thank you.

01:02:39.444 --> 01:02:40.311
Suit yourself.

01:02:42.046 --> 01:02:43.278
If you're still here when I'm
going home,

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.648
I'm calling the cops.

01:03:26.891 --> 01:03:28.891
Oh shit, you're still here.

01:03:28.893 --> 01:03:32.861
Oh, I'm sorry, someone's
coming to get me.

01:03:32.863 --> 01:03:34.029
I can't ride.

01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:34.863
Well why didn't you let me

01:03:34.865 --> 01:03:36.767
get you some help a long time
ago?

01:03:37.902 --> 01:03:40.403
You're a real glutton for
punishment.

01:03:40.405 --> 01:03:41.439
I know.

01:03:43.475 --> 01:03:46.442
But, it's okay.

01:03:46.444 --> 01:03:47.843
There she is.

01:03:47.845 --> 01:03:49.311
This is my ride.

01:03:58.423 --> 01:03:59.256
He with you?

01:04:00.224 --> 01:04:02.726
No, no, but I'll help him.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:09.164
Yeah, good luck with that,
sweetheart.

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:11.168
Preston, are you okay?

01:04:13.304 --> 01:04:15.204
Oh my god, I'm taking you to a
hospital...

01:04:15.206 --> 01:04:17.440
No, no, no, I got it, I got
it.

01:04:17.442 --> 01:04:18.340
There's a motel down the road,

01:04:18.342 --> 01:04:20.075
would you just mind taking me
there?

01:04:20.077 --> 01:04:22.478
Yeah, um, what
about your motorcycle?

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.181
I don't care, just leave it.

01:04:36.494 --> 01:04:40.030
You don't have to stay
here tonight, I'll be okay.

01:04:40.965 --> 01:04:43.865
Uh, actually, I do.

01:04:43.867 --> 01:04:46.404
The campground gate doesn't
open until 9:00 a.m., so.

01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:48.305
Oh.

01:04:51.342 --> 01:04:52.207
Okay.

01:04:52.209 --> 01:04:53.976
Oh whoa, no.

01:04:53.978 --> 01:04:56.011
Just stay there.

01:04:56.013 --> 01:04:57.980
You're gonna wait 'til the bath
water runs

01:04:57.982 --> 01:05:00.249
and then you can get up.

01:05:00.251 --> 01:05:02.985
Oh.

01:05:02.987 --> 01:05:04.422
He really let you have it, huh?

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.528
It's okay.

01:05:14.399 --> 01:05:15.500
Let it happen, Preston.

01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:23.441
My wife and my baby are dead.

01:05:29.947 --> 01:05:32.415
They were killed in an
accident by a drunk driver.

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:33.416
She was just taking her to
school.

01:05:33.418 --> 01:05:36.020
It was 7:30 in the morning.

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:41.459
They were my whole world.

01:05:44.362 --> 01:05:45.996
He took everything from me.

01:05:47.599 --> 01:05:48.964
They were everything I ever
wanted.

01:05:48.966 --> 01:05:50.568
They were everything I ever
needed.

01:05:54.938 --> 01:05:57.172
It's like this thing happened

01:05:57.174 --> 01:05:59.642
and then my whole life was
erased in the blink of an eye

01:05:59.644 --> 01:06:03.278
and I have nothing left
except this numbness

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.483
and the knot of hatred in my
heart

01:06:07.485 --> 01:06:09.652
and I don't know what to
do with myself.

01:06:09.654 --> 01:06:12.622
I don't know how I'm
supposed to go on.

01:06:12.624 --> 01:06:14.557
How am I supposed to live with
this?

01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:18.428
I have nothing left, I mean,
how am I supposed to live?

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.262
By letting it in.

01:06:20.264 --> 01:06:24.436
Preston, you let it in so
that you can let it go.

01:06:25.437 --> 01:06:27.403
You can do this.

01:06:27.405 --> 01:06:29.607
You need to get this out of you.

01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:33.877
And breath and you keep
breathing.

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:38.182
You keep breathing, let
it in and let it go.

01:06:41.453 --> 01:06:43.486
This is your first step.

01:06:43.488 --> 01:06:46.221
This is good, Preston, this is
good.

01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:50.258
This is your first step
and this is a big step

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.130
and I want you to recognize
that, okay?

01:06:54.231 --> 01:06:56.366
Yeah.

01:06:56.368 --> 01:06:58.133
That's good.

01:06:58.135 --> 01:06:59.002
Good.

01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:04.474
All right, let's get
you into the tub, okay?

01:07:04.476 --> 01:07:07.878
Yeah.

01:07:16.954 --> 01:07:17.622
Okay.

01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:50.386
You sure you're gonna be able
to ride?

01:07:50.388 --> 01:07:51.554
Yeah.

01:07:51.556 --> 01:07:53.423
It's gonna hurt a little,
probably, but I'll be okay.

01:07:53.425 --> 01:07:54.289
You sure?

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.159
Yep.

01:07:56.126 --> 01:07:56.994
Okay.

01:07:59.296 --> 01:08:01.329
I owe you an apology.

01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:05.066
No, you don't, you
don't owe me anything.

01:08:05.068 --> 01:08:07.169
I do, I owe you an
apology for the other day

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:09.204
and then here you are
bringing me back up here.

01:08:09.206 --> 01:08:10.506
Thank you.

01:08:10.508 --> 01:08:12.442
It's nothing, Preston.

01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:13.776
I didn't take it personally.

01:08:13.778 --> 01:08:15.145
I know better than that.

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:17.412
Yeah.

01:08:17.415 --> 01:08:18.747
Just take care of yourself.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.049
You be gentle with yourself.

01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:22.283
You're worth it.

01:08:22.286 --> 01:08:26.122
Just remember
let it in, let it go.

01:08:27.692 --> 01:08:31.259
Some days will be easier
than others and that's okay.

01:08:31.261 --> 01:08:33.531
Look around you, life is
beautiful.

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:38.403
Trust me, you'll be okay.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.408
Thanks.

01:10:35.653 --> 01:10:36.586
Morning.

01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:46.582
I mean, I didn't know what to
think.

01:12:46.584 --> 01:12:51.754
You don't say anything, you
just, you just disappear.

01:12:51.756 --> 01:12:53.489
Nobody knows where you are.

01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:55.325
I go over there, the house is
empty.

01:12:57.762 --> 01:12:58.730
Sorry Gary.

01:12:59.464 --> 01:13:01.897
I start checking around
with anybody I could find

01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:06.569
at the store and then, when
I can't get a hold of ya,

01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:07.536
I start thinking the worst.

01:13:07.538 --> 01:13:10.808
I know, I know, I
shoulda stayed in touch.

01:13:11.776 --> 01:13:12.643
Yeah.

01:13:14.746 --> 01:13:16.746
I mean Preston, come on.

01:13:16.748 --> 01:13:17.947
I can relate.

01:13:17.949 --> 01:13:19.982
I lost my wife eight years ago
to cancer.

01:13:19.984 --> 01:13:23.454
I lose my daughter, I
lose my little grand baby.

01:13:26.057 --> 01:13:27.257
There is no,

01:13:28.359 --> 01:13:29.594
there's no words.

01:13:32.063 --> 01:13:35.631
Let me tell you
something, man,

01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:39.604
that kind of hurt will
break you if you let it.

01:13:41.539 --> 01:13:42.406
I know.

01:13:43.074 --> 01:13:44.341
- Okay?
- Yep.

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:45.910
Yep.

01:13:48.012 --> 01:13:50.681
Theo loved you more than
anything

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:54.483
and nothing made my wife and I
happier

01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:57.922
than the day that the two
of you got married, nothing.

01:13:59.023 --> 01:13:59.891
We're family.

01:14:01.626 --> 01:14:03.961
Thank you, I'm so sorry, I
just,

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.030
got in a bad way and I'm just

01:14:08.032 --> 01:14:09.098
trying to get my feet back under
me.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.966
I find, hey, you know what?

01:14:10.968 --> 01:14:14.770
No, you gotta handle this any
way you can,

01:14:14.772 --> 01:14:15.805
any way you know how.

01:14:15.807 --> 01:14:17.773
You have to handle it your way.

01:14:17.775 --> 01:14:18.841
But I want you to look around
here, man

01:14:18.843 --> 01:14:21.512
and look at this, look where we
are.

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:28.519
Mm, look at this.

01:14:30.388 --> 01:14:33.522
You are way too young to
be throwing in the towel

01:14:33.524 --> 01:14:34.723
in your life right now.

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:37.026
Okay, Theo would not have it,
all right?

01:14:37.028 --> 01:14:39.128
She would not let you stop going
on

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:40.963
living your life because of
this.

01:14:40.965 --> 01:14:42.598
She wouldn't.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.433
I'm not gonna let you either.

01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:46.502
You wanna honor her and Anna?

01:14:46.504 --> 01:14:49.171
Then you dig yourself out
of this any way you can,

01:14:49.173 --> 01:14:50.372
every single day of your life.

01:14:50.374 --> 01:14:53.477
Get up in the morning and
think, how can I move forward?

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.646
You know I'm telling you the
truth.

01:14:57.648 --> 01:14:58.516
Yeah, I do.

01:15:01.786 --> 01:15:04.753
You know Theo

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:07.890
would accept nothing less.

01:15:07.892 --> 01:15:09.458
- Right?
- I do.

01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.098
Give me a hug man, come on.

01:15:15.066 --> 01:15:16.899
You can do this.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.984
I'm gonna be there for you no
matter what.

01:15:36.621 --> 01:15:41.523
I'm gonna be there for
you too, Gary, I promise.

01:17:53.078 --> 01:17:58.078
