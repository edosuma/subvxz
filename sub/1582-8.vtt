01:41.246 --> 01:43.547
Merry Christmas, movie house!

01:43.582 --> 01:46.317
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mouse!

01:53.358 --> 01:55.926
Hey-hey.
Due to modern sensitivity,

01:55.961 --> 01:58.829
we've been asked to block
any violent images

01:58.864 --> 02:00.731
that appear
in this children's cartoon.

02:00.765 --> 02:02.500
Oh, my God!

02:02.534 --> 02:05.336
I never watched
one of these sober!

02:05.370 --> 02:08.104
I gotta get this bloodbath
off my kids' show!

02:12.944 --> 02:14.345
<i>Damn it!</i>

02:14.379 --> 02:16.680
Aw, geez, when did
everything turn to crap?

02:16.715 --> 02:19.984
Bart, don't use language
like that.

02:21.653 --> 02:24.054
<i>Man, things sure have</i>
<i>turned to crap.</i>

02:24.089 --> 02:25.523
Homer,

02:25.557 --> 02:27.825
you have to take
the Halloween decorations down

02:27.859 --> 02:29.927
before you put
the Christmas ones up.

02:29.961 --> 02:32.963
Marge, to that I say,
boo, humbug.

02:40.472 --> 02:43.107
There's a new Grinch this
holiday season,

02:43.141 --> 02:44.808
and its name
is "global warming."

02:44.843 --> 02:47.845
Meteorologists warn there'll be
no snow this Christmas

02:47.879 --> 02:50.314
anywhere in America,
not even in Alaska,

02:50.348 --> 02:54.118
where the Eskimos now have
a hundred words for "nothing."

02:54.152 --> 02:55.553
Global warming. Huh.

02:55.587 --> 02:58.856
By pure coincidence,
every scientist was right.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.958
But it's not all doom and gloom.

03:00.992 --> 03:03.527
Illegal poachers are having
a field day.

03:03.562 --> 03:05.963
♪ 80 degrees,
water won't freeze ♪

03:05.997 --> 03:08.032
♪ God help us, please,
no one's on skis ♪

03:08.066 --> 03:10.134
♪ Happy, happy, happy,
happy hunting ♪

03:11.336 --> 03:13.904
♪ Happy, happy, happy,
happy hunting. ♪

03:20.712 --> 03:23.380
Sorry, kids, I guess
the hats and mittens will have

03:23.415 --> 03:24.982
to wait until next year.

03:25.016 --> 03:26.584
Oh!
Oh!

03:43.101 --> 03:44.201
Hmm?

03:44.235 --> 03:46.604
Snow?

03:46.638 --> 03:48.672
Snow!

03:50.041 --> 03:52.643
Oh, you know what
this means, kids?

03:53.845 --> 03:56.914
I don't have
to pick up the dog poops!

04:00.285 --> 04:02.686
Uh, so you see, the "snow"

04:02.721 --> 04:05.255
is a microclimate aberration

04:05.290 --> 04:08.759
caused by radioactive steam
from the nuclear plant

04:08.793 --> 04:10.961
and, of course,
tire fire particulate.

04:10.996 --> 04:14.198
So, we're the only place
in America with snow,

04:14.232 --> 04:16.834
if you can call it that.
I guess you can.

04:18.136 --> 04:20.938
Don't you idiots see
what this means?!

04:20.971 --> 04:22.906
Idiots? Why do we
reelect this guy?

04:22.941 --> 04:25.809
'Cause his opponent has
a long Slavic name.

04:27.278 --> 04:29.313
Who want bumper sticker?

04:29.347 --> 04:32.816
People, Springfield is now
the only town in America

04:32.851 --> 04:35.219
that has snow this Christmas.

04:35.253 --> 04:37.821
So tourists are going
to want to come here.

04:37.856 --> 04:39.890
Stay in our hotels!

04:39.924 --> 04:41.258
Slurp our spaghetti.

04:41.292 --> 04:43.961
Die in our hospitals.

04:43.995 --> 04:47.398
I say we welcome our
winter tourists with open arms,

04:47.432 --> 04:49.166
then gouge the hell out of 'em!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.602
Who? Who will gouge with me?

04:51.636 --> 04:53.270
I, too, will gouge!

04:53.304 --> 04:57.775
Duff Beer is proud to make a
corporate commitment to gouging!

05:05.450 --> 05:07.351
Here come the tourists.

05:07.385 --> 05:10.054
Man your ATMs. Yar.

05:23.702 --> 05:25.502
Why would a robot need mittens?

05:25.537 --> 05:28.205
Why would a little boy
need an aspirin?

05:28.239 --> 05:29.773
I don't know.

05:29.808 --> 05:32.976
The one thing Bongo Comics
are good for.

05:36.981 --> 05:38.515
Are you okay, Chief?

05:38.550 --> 05:40.317
I'll be fine,
I'll be fine.

05:40.351 --> 05:42.886
God, I bent down to
pick up a piece of candy

05:42.921 --> 05:44.221
and rolled down a hill.

05:44.255 --> 05:45.989
You always think
it's the other guy

05:46.024 --> 05:47.624
that'll turn into
a giant snowball.

05:47.659 --> 05:48.826
Never you.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.894
Have you seen Lou?

05:50.929 --> 05:53.030
There's snow in my lungs!

05:53.064 --> 05:54.898
Lot of attitude
in that hand, Lou.

05:54.933 --> 05:56.633
Lot of attitude.

05:58.403 --> 06:00.904
Look at all these out-of-state
license plates.

06:00.939 --> 06:02.673
"First in Freeways,"

06:02.707 --> 06:04.041
"The 'Yuh-Huh' State,"

06:04.075 --> 06:05.843
"Jewel of the Fracking Belt"?

06:05.877 --> 06:07.745
"Still a British Colony
at Heart,"

06:07.779 --> 06:09.747
"Land of Many Water Snakes"?

06:11.082 --> 06:13.751
Valet parking,
five dollars.

06:15.687 --> 06:17.287
Oh...

06:21.025 --> 06:23.861
People, I'm completely out
of milk!

06:23.895 --> 06:26.363
I do have several DVDs
of the movie <i>Milk,</i>

06:26.397 --> 06:30.300
an inspiring return to form
for director Gus Van Sant.

06:30.335 --> 06:32.503
Uh, do you have <i>Life of Pi?</i>

06:32.537 --> 06:36.907
No, but I have some home movies
of me on a canoe with a big dog.

06:36.941 --> 06:39.810
People who have never seen
a movie say it is a good movie.

06:48.586 --> 06:51.088
Mmm?

06:53.491 --> 06:55.626
We can't afford Christmas.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.361
And when you can't afford
Christmas,

06:57.395 --> 06:59.429
you've failed as a family.

06:59.464 --> 07:01.799
That's what
all the big stores say.

07:03.134 --> 07:04.401
Excuse me, ma'am.

07:04.435 --> 07:06.570
I'm so sorry
to bother you,

07:06.604 --> 07:09.273
but my kids are exhausted
and the town is sold out.

07:09.307 --> 07:12.309
Is there any chance you'd
have a spare room for us?

07:12.343 --> 07:14.711
Well, there's a rec room
off the kitchen,

07:14.746 --> 07:17.381
but sometimes it's there
and sometimes it isn't.

07:17.415 --> 07:20.117
Our house is very odd that way.

07:20.151 --> 07:22.953
Please? Please, ma'am?
We'd pay you $300 a night.

07:22.987 --> 07:25.956
Well, you seem
like a nice, pushy stranger.

07:25.990 --> 07:27.791
Ma'am, because we
talk this way,

07:27.826 --> 07:29.326
people always think
that we're, um...

07:29.360 --> 07:30.761
Uh, what is that word, honey?

07:30.795 --> 07:31.895
Passive-aggressive.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.497
Right, right, but we're not.

07:33.531 --> 07:36.800
Please, please take our
money and everybody wins.

07:44.442 --> 07:45.576
Hmm?

07:45.610 --> 07:48.645
Oh, good.
Marge remarried after I died.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.480
Wait a minute. I'm not dead.

07:50.515 --> 07:51.748
What's going on?!

07:51.783 --> 07:53.851
These are
our new boarders.

07:53.885 --> 07:56.486
Uh-uh. No way.
I'm not sharing my bed

07:56.521 --> 07:58.255
with anybody except you.

07:58.289 --> 07:59.823
And maybe that guy.
Lincoln-style.

07:59.858 --> 08:01.325
But that's it.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.160
This is a great thing.

08:03.194 --> 08:05.095
We're helping people
celebrate Christmas,

08:05.129 --> 08:07.664
and we'll be able
to afford Christmas.

08:07.699 --> 08:09.933
Oh, I don't know.
It won't seem like Christmas

08:09.968 --> 08:13.604
without opening up a giant
credit card bill in January.

08:13.638 --> 08:14.972
Take a look at this.

08:15.006 --> 08:16.974
What the...?

08:17.008 --> 08:19.810
"The Simpson Bed and Breakfast"?

08:19.844 --> 08:23.013
I always wanted to stay
in a place like this.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.148
But Christmas is
a special time.

08:25.183 --> 08:27.217
And I like to spend it
in the warm embrace

08:27.252 --> 08:29.119
of watching football.

08:29.153 --> 08:31.121
Homer Simpson,
ask yourself,

08:31.155 --> 08:33.957
W.W.B.J.D.?
Huh?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.491
What would Baby Jesus do?

08:39.496 --> 08:42.799
♪ My baby she told me
she don't want to hold me ♪

08:42.833 --> 08:46.069
♪ And kiss my lips anymore

08:46.104 --> 08:48.805
♪ She's gonna leave me

08:48.840 --> 08:50.440
♪ And she don't believe me

08:50.475 --> 08:53.977
♪ That I'll be true now

08:54.012 --> 08:55.946
♪ Well, maybe
she don't love me ♪

08:55.980 --> 08:57.714
♪ And is not thinkin' of me

08:57.749 --> 08:59.917
♪ But why'd she do it
this time of year? ♪

08:59.951 --> 09:01.718
♪ <i>Doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo</i> ♪

09:01.753 --> 09:05.255
♪ She knows that I'll miss her
and I'll want to kiss her ♪

09:05.290 --> 09:08.992
♪ If just for Christmas

09:09.027 --> 09:10.861
♪ Merry Christmas...

09:10.895 --> 09:14.431
Well, this crazy scheme is
the kind of impulsive behavior

09:14.465 --> 09:16.700
I want to encourage in you.

09:16.734 --> 09:19.603
Mmm... I'm in! 100%!

09:19.637 --> 09:21.104
Oh, thank you.

09:21.139 --> 09:23.106
Now, Homie,
table three needs more bread.

09:23.141 --> 09:25.008
I'm on a break.

10:00.311 --> 10:02.145
Welcome to our day care center.

10:02.179 --> 10:05.315
All girls, please move
to cootie quarantine.

10:05.349 --> 10:07.717
We've got a two-month-old.

10:07.751 --> 10:09.552
Are you sure
you can handle her?

10:09.587 --> 10:11.354
Just don't lose
this claim ticket.

10:11.388 --> 10:13.523
That church doesn't
look very inspiring.

10:13.557 --> 10:15.525
What a bland marquee.

10:15.559 --> 10:17.559
It doesn't look very inviting.

10:19.196 --> 10:21.564
This whole crowd's gonna be
at my sermon today.

10:21.599 --> 10:24.400
Darling, did St. Paul
worry about the crowds?

10:24.435 --> 10:27.170
Oh, he wrote letters.
Any fool can write letters.

10:33.510 --> 10:36.713
Lord, I'm just
a small-town minister.

10:36.747 --> 10:38.681
We don't have Mormon money.

10:38.716 --> 10:41.851
But if you could see your way
to guiding my fingers

10:41.885 --> 10:44.253
as I type this sermon...

10:47.791 --> 10:49.425
Oh, yeah.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.894
Oh, this is black-church good.

10:58.469 --> 11:00.069
My friends...

11:01.772 --> 11:03.840
When he starts with
"my friends," it's always bad.

11:03.874 --> 11:05.875
Friends, every year,

11:05.909 --> 11:09.345
I tell you this holiday
is about the birth of our Lord,

11:09.380 --> 11:12.515
not singing Santas
and full stockings.

11:14.318 --> 11:15.385
You're losing us!

11:15.419 --> 11:16.753
Christmas is not about

11:16.787 --> 11:18.187
what happened in a manger

11:18.222 --> 11:20.223
some 2,000 years ago.

11:20.257 --> 11:23.860
It is about
what you do for others now.

11:23.894 --> 11:25.161
Oh!

11:27.264 --> 11:28.364
Get my the church bulletin.

11:28.399 --> 11:29.699
Lovejoy's on fire.

11:29.733 --> 11:33.102
Christmas is the Holy Spirit.

11:33.137 --> 11:35.872
Ooh, I didn't know
there were doves in there.

11:35.906 --> 11:37.407
Give with your hearts!

11:37.441 --> 11:39.208
Give with your acts!

11:39.243 --> 11:40.443
And you will know

11:40.477 --> 11:43.446
the true meaning of Christmas.

11:49.153 --> 11:51.220
Wow, what a showman.

11:54.525 --> 11:55.825
I haven't felt this inspired

11:55.859 --> 11:57.493
since the blueberries
at breakfast.

11:57.528 --> 11:59.962
Daddy, permission
for a religious fit?

11:59.997 --> 12:01.230
A brief one.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.734
I said a fit,
not a fervor.

12:04.768 --> 12:07.303
That sermon
really inspired me.

12:07.337 --> 12:09.372
This whole Christmas
has been about money.

12:11.308 --> 12:12.909
Oh, are you with
the Salvation Army?

12:12.943 --> 12:14.077
What makes you
think that?

12:15.145 --> 12:16.646
Bless you.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.948
But I'm gonna give gifts
that aren't expensive

12:18.982 --> 12:20.316
and come from the heart.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.018
I don't know.

12:22.052 --> 12:24.420
Christmas didn't get to be
the number one holiday

12:24.455 --> 12:26.322
by being about love.

12:26.356 --> 12:30.126
Um, when a woman talks,
she just wants to be heard.

12:34.765 --> 12:36.332
Where's the end?

12:39.778 --> 12:42.180
Hey, Marge, we're running
out of chestnuts over here.

12:42.214 --> 12:43.848
Well, they don't
grow on trees.

12:43.882 --> 12:44.916
Uh, yeah, they do.

12:44.950 --> 12:46.250
Oh.

12:46.285 --> 12:48.186
What about our
romantic carriage ride

12:48.220 --> 12:49.320
through the snow?

12:49.355 --> 12:51.122
Setting it up.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.928
I don't think
you're giving them

12:56.962 --> 12:58.629
what they were
promised, Dad.

12:58.664 --> 13:02.333
The secret is:
Don't read the comment cards.

13:06.672 --> 13:08.139
Where do the people sit?

13:08.173 --> 13:09.807
I thought they were
just gonna watch me.

13:09.842 --> 13:10.875
Excuse me.

13:10.909 --> 13:12.210
This eggnog
is terrible.

13:12.244 --> 13:14.345
All eggnog
is terrible.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.482
Those stockings are not
hung by the chimney with care.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.385
Why did I do this
for money?

13:20.419 --> 13:22.286
Why did I do this
for money?

13:22.321 --> 13:24.455
And the Christmas special
on your television

13:24.490 --> 13:26.290
is one of the worst.

13:26.325 --> 13:30.061
We now return to <i>King Winter</i>
<i>Feasts On His Children.</i>

13:30.095 --> 13:33.297
By the time Princess Summer
comes to save you,

13:33.332 --> 13:36.034
you'll all be blood in my beard.

13:36.068 --> 13:37.502
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

13:37.536 --> 13:39.337
Your own father's beard.

13:46.745 --> 13:48.513
How long
to see Santa?

13:48.547 --> 13:50.181
How would I know?
I'm an accountant.

13:50.215 --> 13:52.183
I imagine for
small business, huh?

13:52.217 --> 13:53.785
God, I hate Christmas.

13:53.819 --> 13:55.420
Huh?

13:55.454 --> 13:58.423
Mr. Flanders,
where's your store?

13:58.457 --> 14:01.225
Well, I'm down to a kiosk,
thanks to that place.

14:03.362 --> 14:05.096
Actually, half
a kiosk.

14:05.130 --> 14:06.864
Sharing it with
Nasreen here.

14:06.899 --> 14:10.535
No cream is finer
than mall kiosk cream.

14:10.569 --> 14:11.669
J.Lo use it.

14:11.703 --> 14:12.904
No, thanks.

14:12.938 --> 14:15.506
It is no wonder
you are not married.

14:15.541 --> 14:16.741
Flip me back.

14:19.578 --> 14:21.112
If I have to give presents,

14:21.146 --> 14:22.580
I'll give presents
with a purpose.

14:22.614 --> 14:25.516
One for Maggie. Check.

14:25.551 --> 14:27.852
All that's left is Bart.

14:27.886 --> 14:29.053
No.

14:29.088 --> 14:31.122
No. No.

14:31.156 --> 14:32.390
No, no, no...

14:32.424 --> 14:34.625
Ah, perfect.

14:36.295 --> 14:38.329
♪ All from Satan's power

14:38.363 --> 14:42.600
♪ As we were gone astray

14:42.634 --> 14:45.169
♪ Oh, tidings

14:45.204 --> 14:48.973
♪ Of comfort and joy

14:49.007 --> 14:54.245
♪ In Bethlehem, in Israel
this blessed babe was born... ♪

14:54.279 --> 14:55.480
Enough. Stop.

14:55.514 --> 14:58.249
Christmas carols
only have one verse.

14:58.283 --> 15:00.251
Well, they may have more,
but the second verse

15:00.285 --> 15:02.120
is where they get
all weird and religiousy.

15:02.154 --> 15:03.754
Uh, more
wassail, please.

15:03.789 --> 15:05.990
And don't skimp on
the aromatic bitters.

15:06.024 --> 15:08.059
For your information,
Gloria,

15:08.093 --> 15:11.429
my wassail is just Gatorade
I put in the microwave.

15:11.463 --> 15:14.065
I drank that
under the mistletoe.

15:14.099 --> 15:15.133
It's not mistletoe,

15:15.167 --> 15:17.768
just cherries and lettuce.
Oh!

15:17.803 --> 15:20.438
I thought when I ate it,
it wasn't poisonous.

15:20.472 --> 15:22.306
I've opened up
my house to you

15:22.341 --> 15:24.742
and all you do
is fill this joyous season

15:24.776 --> 15:26.244
with petty complaints.

15:26.278 --> 15:28.246
Ho, ho, ho.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.181
Not now. Take
out that pillow

15:30.215 --> 15:32.350
and put it in
room three.

15:33.452 --> 15:35.586
The pillow acted as a girdle.

15:35.621 --> 15:37.155
Any more questions?

15:37.189 --> 15:39.123
Uh, yes, will
the pudding be figgy?

15:39.158 --> 15:41.425
The pudding
will be Jell-O.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.827
Quite so.

15:42.861 --> 15:45.096
I'm going to
sulk in my room.

15:45.130 --> 15:48.432
The only thing good about
this place is the piano player.

16:06.351 --> 16:08.853
An Angelica Button wizard robe.

16:08.887 --> 16:11.055
With wand pocket.

16:11.089 --> 16:12.823
And wand.

16:12.858 --> 16:15.326
Professor Digglesby's wand.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.395
Now I have every
wizarding stick

16:17.429 --> 16:19.330
from the Spells and
Potions Department

16:19.364 --> 16:20.965
of Wagglepoofs Academy.

16:20.999 --> 16:22.400
Don't make me
learn about it.

16:22.434 --> 16:24.468
I know this Christmas
has been a little rocky,

16:24.503 --> 16:26.003
even for the Simpsons,

16:26.038 --> 16:29.006
but I think these gifts
born of thought and love

16:29.041 --> 16:32.410
will restore the balance
of prajna and samsara.

16:33.712 --> 16:34.845
I mean holly and jolly.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.214
Now, Dad,

16:36.248 --> 16:38.216
I'd like to give you
your present.

16:39.251 --> 16:40.351
You got me weed?

16:40.385 --> 16:41.652
Even better.

16:41.687 --> 16:43.921
They're bags
of seeds.

16:43.956 --> 16:46.824
So that you can plant a
garden and watch it grow.

16:46.858 --> 16:48.426
That's great, sweetie.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.662
After all that time
and hard work, I'll have...

16:51.697 --> 16:53.030
radishes?!

16:53.065 --> 16:55.266
It's the most hated
part of salad,

16:55.300 --> 16:57.168
which is the most hated
part of dinner.

16:57.202 --> 17:00.071
Radishes, nothing but radishes.

17:02.808 --> 17:04.407
Dad, stop.

17:04.443 --> 17:07.011
What? I'm saving them
from the struggle of life.

17:07.045 --> 17:09.347
Well, at least you're
eating vegetables.

17:09.381 --> 17:10.647
Vegetables?!

17:11.717 --> 17:13.550
Okay, Bart,
open your present.

17:13.585 --> 17:15.553
It's the one I'm
most excited about.

17:15.587 --> 17:17.989
Plastic bubbling vomit,
plastic bubbling vomit.

17:19.223 --> 17:21.959
What? Lis,
you're smart.

17:21.993 --> 17:23.794
Why would you
give <i>me</i> a book?

17:23.829 --> 17:25.029
'Cause it's
easy to wrap?

17:25.063 --> 17:27.098
Nothing is easy to wrap.

17:27.132 --> 17:28.366
I have trouble with scissors.

17:31.603 --> 17:34.939
Marge, the brochure
promised us a happy Christmas.

17:34.973 --> 17:36.807
My uncle died
in your bed.

17:36.842 --> 17:38.576
Merry Christmas.

17:45.017 --> 17:46.250
What?

17:46.285 --> 17:48.085
N.C. Wyeth.

17:49.354 --> 17:51.522
These are book illustrations.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.426
Stop it! Stop it!

17:55.460 --> 17:57.628
Why in the world would
you burn a book?

17:57.663 --> 17:59.897
Actually, the idea
to do this came from a book.

17:59.931 --> 18:02.266
<i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury?

18:02.301 --> 18:05.269
What? No, I got it
from this.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.271
See?

18:07.306 --> 18:09.473
How could you burn the
present I gave you?

18:09.508 --> 18:11.108
Because it's
<i>my</i> present.

18:11.143 --> 18:13.744
Did you give it to me
because you thought I'd like it

18:13.779 --> 18:16.447
or because <i>you</i> wanted to feel
better about yourself?

18:16.481 --> 18:19.116
Children, perhaps it's
time that I explain

18:19.151 --> 18:20.651
the true meaning
of Christmas.

18:20.686 --> 18:21.752
Shut up, Flanders.

18:21.787 --> 18:23.854
Okily-dokily.

18:25.324 --> 18:27.024
Now, did you check
the room to make sure

18:27.059 --> 18:28.159
you haven't left anything?
All set.

18:28.193 --> 18:29.760
Need directions
or a bottle of water?

18:29.795 --> 18:31.429
No, thanks. We're fine.

18:31.463 --> 18:33.998
Thank you, sir.

18:35.701 --> 18:37.835
Oh, right, we're
still doing that.

18:37.869 --> 18:39.937
Come on. I'll drive
you to the airport.

18:39.971 --> 18:42.340
Where are my keys?
Oh, right in here.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.041
Bart, you
were right.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.377
If you smell your farts
in a dream, you die?

18:46.411 --> 18:48.612
No, about Christmas.

18:48.647 --> 18:51.949
So I went out this morning
and I got you this.

18:51.983 --> 18:53.984
It's a tablet
with books on it,

18:54.019 --> 18:57.688
but also apps, like
Worms With Friends.

18:59.157 --> 19:01.025
Wow. But how'd you afford it?

19:01.059 --> 19:03.227
I sold the gift you gave me.

19:05.530 --> 19:07.365
Get the twist?
Obviously.

19:07.399 --> 19:08.966
You're saying
it's from Maggie,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.634
but actually
it's from you.

19:10.669 --> 19:11.702
Thanks, Lis.

19:11.737 --> 19:13.137
Now, why don't you
donate that

19:13.171 --> 19:15.339
to whatever
hopeless cause you want.

19:15.374 --> 19:16.874
Thanks, Bart.

19:16.908 --> 19:20.144
This will make a lot of
arctic loons very happy.

19:21.179 --> 19:22.546
Uh, listen,

19:22.581 --> 19:23.748
I just
wanted to say

19:23.782 --> 19:26.217
I'm sorry
I overreacted.

19:26.251 --> 19:28.052
Thank you all for coming.

19:28.086 --> 19:30.554
Yeah, well, we have something
to say to you, Marge.

a merry Christmas ♪

19:35.093 --> 19:37.528

19:54.279 --> 19:55.679

19:55.714 --> 19:58.115
Okay, we'll sing
a different one.

19:58.150 --> 20:00.518
♪ Good King Wenceslas
looked out ♪

20:00.552 --> 20:02.553
