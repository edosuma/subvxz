Previously on the "Secret Life
of the American Teenager"...

00:03.000 --> 00:05.500
Ricky? Hey, are you
still picking me up?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.400
I'll be right there.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.200
If you could hurry.
I'm here by myself.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.500
Don't panic. I'm on the way.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.700
What the hell's going on here?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Grace, get down here!

00:14.000 --> 00:15.300
I can explain...

00:15.300 --> 00:18.600
And why would your sister say
she's having sex if she's not having sex?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.200
She knows about the baby.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.700
I should never let you 
talk to me in this stiup????

00:22.700 --> 00:24.800
All I know is you took me
into a conre and took off.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.700
She make a big mistake.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.900
But she didn't make the same
mistake Amy Juergens make.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.200
???

00:29.200 --> 00:30.600
Is every thing OK?

00:30.600 --> 00:33.500
I'm not ??? 

00:33.700 --> 00:34.500
She ???

00:34.500 --> 00:36.700
She can't be ??. I just kiss her.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.600
Dad, Ashley is not having sex.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.000
She pulls these stunts when she's
trying to distract us from something.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
Are you having sex?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.900
You mean some another new?

00:43.900 --> 00:44.800
Can't told them. 

00:44.800 --> 00:46.200
Ashley, I have to.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.000
I don't think it's gonna make Ricky
jealous if we just go to church.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.500
It might make Grace jealous.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500
you are going to church just so that
you can "get with" Grace Bowman.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.500
????

00:57.500 --> 00:58.400
I don't know.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.600
I will be back in coupe days

00:59.600 --> 01:00.000
OK.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.300
I'm fine.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.300
Mmm.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.600
I love you, Amy Juergens.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.700
Thanks. Me too.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.900
And I love that you love to eat.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.100
I really don't know why
I'm so hungry all the time.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.700
Hmm. Here you go.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.900
Thank you. That was really good.

03:50.900 --> 03:51.900
You're welcome.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.900
So, uh, how'd you learn
to make chicken wings?

03:56.900 --> 03:59.100
I, uh, grew up with the Sausage King.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.300
I got tired of sausage.
Had to make something else.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.500
Listen, could I... ask you something?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.700
Uh, yeah.Yeah, I guess.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.600
Will you marry me?

The Secret life of the American Teenager S01E05

05:09.500 --> 05:11.400
A simple "yes" would do.

05:15.700 --> 05:16.800
You know?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.400
I know that I love you.

05:22.900 --> 05:26.700
You know... about me?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.000
Uh, I'm not sure
what you're talking about,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.400
but I know that I love you
and I wanna marry you.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.600
Why did this all have to happen to me?

05:37.900 --> 05:41.500
Well, I know you could have fallen in 
love with someone who's more deserving,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.800
but I'm not that bad. Don't cry.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.200
- Who told you?
- What?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.400
Who told you?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.300
My dad.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.700
Your dad knows?

05:51.700 --> 05:52.900
He suspected.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.900
I am so embarrassed.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.000
No, don't be embarrassed. It's OK.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
No, it's not OK!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.800
It's definitely not OK.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.400
Ben, you're such a nice person.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.800
I'm such a whore.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.500
Well, you're my whore.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.100
No, I'm sorry. It was a joke.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.300
I just meant that I love you.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.700
What am I gonna do?

06:23.100 --> 06:25.500
Well, marry me, of course.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.000
I can't get married. My parents
will never let me. I'm only 15.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.600
I'm not even sure they're 
gonna let me do this.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.800
Maybe they'll want me to
get an abortion or something.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.400
No. No, Amy, you don't have
to do that. I'm here for you.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.900
Look, I know that I can be a complete idiot
some of the time, or most of the time, 

06:40.900 --> 06:44.100
Look, I know that I can be a complete
idiot some of the time, or most of the time,

06:44.100 --> 06:48.700
but... I love you, and I'll
care for you if you let me.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.700
And we can tell your parents that it's 
my baby, that it's yours and mine,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.100
and that we're getting married.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.800
I am so stupid.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.000
Ben, I lied to you.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.600
I had sex with Ricky.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.600
It was awful sex, though. I mean,
it only lasted, like, two seconds,

07:09.100 --> 07:11.700
and I wasn't even sure it was sex until...

07:13.100 --> 07:14.700
this happened.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.500
What am I gonna do?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.700
What am I gonna do?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.800
Everything's gonna be fine.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.900
I don't know how or when,
but everything's gonna be fine.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.800
- How do you know that?
- Cause everything is fine.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.100
No. Everything is not fine.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.200
I mean, I'm getting fatter
and fatter by the second,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.300
and more and more
people are finding out.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.200
Sooner or later, my parents
are gonna find out.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.100
So is Ricky.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.500
You haven't told him yet?

07:49.000 --> 07:49.900
Then don't. Don't.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.000
As far as Ricky and the whole
rest of the world is concerned,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.900
that's my baby and
that you're my wife.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.600
Mrs. Amy Boykewich,
the Sausage Queen.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.400
Or, no, the Sausage Princess.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.900
Ben...

08:04.900 --> 08:06.300
And, please,

08:07.700 --> 08:09.100
let me be your prince.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.700
OK. I deserve that fake smile.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
You're smart, you know that?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.700
I know that.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.800
What is your story, drummer boy?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.799
My story.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.100
It's kinda personal.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.100
I'm in foster care.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.400
I don't live with my mom and dad
because... they were both bad people.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.799
That's usually how 
you get in foster care.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.500
I myself didn't do anything.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.400
- What they do? 
- I don't wanna talk about it.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.000
Let's talk about something else.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.400
- OK.
- Uh...

08:51.400 --> 08:53.700
It's Sunday. We could watch football.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.900
- You like football?
- No.

08:55.900 --> 08:56.900
Me neither.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.900
I... I don't understand the rules.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.000
I don't understand
why they have rules.

09:03.300 --> 09:07.300
I don't understand why 
guys put on a bunch of pads 

09:07.400 --> 09:10.200
and smack into each other
just to get a ball around a field.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.400
- They do it to get girls.
- To get girls?

09:13.400 --> 09:17.400
The same reason you play the drums.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.400
I don't play drums
just to get girls, OK?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.700
I can't just keep him waiting.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.500
Listen, we fed him. Now he can go.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.900
We said you could be friends.
We didn't say you could date him.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.500
In fact,I'm not sure that we're gonna
let you date anyone ever again at this point.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.400
Sorry to interrupt.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.900
I think I should be going now.

09:42.900 --> 09:46.500
We can do a movie some other time.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.900
- Or not.
- Hey, I'm very happy that you went to church.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.500
I am, too. I think it's great.You should
come next Sunday when we're there.

09:53.500 --> 09:58.100
Yeah, or some other Sunday in the near
or very, very distant future is fine.

09:58.100 --> 09:58.900
Dad...

09:58.900 --> 10:02.900
Well, thanks for the invitation.
I like goin' to church.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.600
And, look, I know you don't 
trust me, and I don't blame you,

10:06.600 --> 10:09.300
but I just wanna say that...

10:09.300 --> 10:11.800
I was just tryin' to help 
Grace out because I like her.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.000
I like her a lot.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.700
And I like you, too, Ricky.
We all really like you.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.600
Thank you guys for lunch.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.700
You're welcome.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.300
See ya at school, Grace.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.300
- Bye, Ricky.
- Bye, Ricky.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
Bye, Ricky.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.000
See ya in a couple days.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.500
You're not going on
a business trip, are you?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.700
What, did she kick you out
of the house or something?

10:55.700 --> 10:57.400
No one kicks me out of my house.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.100
You mind your own business
and be a good girl.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.600
Are you seeing someone?
Got a girlfriend or something?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.600
This is not a conversation
a father has with his daughter.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.500
No, I'm not seeing someone.
Your mother may think I am, but I'm not.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.100
Dad...

11:14.300 --> 11:15.300
Just don't go.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.400
Look, you know how you always wanna
be treated older? Like an adult?

11:20.900 --> 11:24.900
Well, now... now's a good time
to grow up a little bit

11:25.200 --> 11:27.500
and realize that things don't always
work out like you want them to.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.800
Dad, just please don't go, OK?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.700
I-I promise. I'll do
anything you want.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.200
I mean, I'll-I'll wear
long skirts or high jeans,

11:35.200 --> 11:37.900
and I won't wear makeup,
and I won't dye my hair,

11:37.900 --> 11:41.100
and I'll get good grades,
and I'll make decent friends

11:41.100 --> 11:43.400
like you're always telling
me to,just, Dad, please.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.200
Ashley, please, this is hard enough.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
Dad...

11:49.500 --> 11:50.700
Hey...

11:51.900 --> 11:53.900
It's not like I'm not gonna be around.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
I'll be around.
I'll always be around for you.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.400
No, you won't.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.200
And I don't wanna
have divorced parents.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.600
Everyone has divorced parents, and
I don't wanna be like everyone else.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.600
I know, sweetheart. I know.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.300
We're just takin' a break. No one
said anything about divorce here.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.900
We just need some time alone,
you know? Some time to think.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.900
I gotta go.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.700
Look, I don't want you blaming
yourself for anything that happens.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.300
This has nothing to do with you or Amy.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.100
Sometimes things just happen.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.700
Things just happen?

12:31.600 --> 12:35.100
No, things don't just happen.
Things just happen when...

12:38.800 --> 12:40.600
Why'd you have to cheat on her, man?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.300
I mean, she's pretty, she's smart,
she's nice, and she's my mother.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.700
How could you leave her?
How could you leave us, especially now?!

12:58.200 --> 12:59.500
especially now?

13:11.400 --> 13:16.800
Um, you have to actually read the book
before you write the report.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.500
I read it. It's not about buffaloes.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.600
Buffffaloes ??? soldiers.

13:23.000 --> 13:23.900
No.

13:23.900 --> 13:27.200
I'm kidding. Kind of. But so what?

13:27.200 --> 13:29.700
The teacher couldn't have
possibly read 30 books.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.700
She couldn't know what happens
in every single one of 'em.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.800
I think she knows what a
buffalo soldier is. I doubt it.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.600
I'm not even a teacher,
and I read 30 books last summer.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.200
You did not.
Yeah, I did.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.300
Children's books?
Not children's books, real books.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.200
- Why?
- 'Cause I like to read.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.000
Great. Could you read this
one and write the report?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.300
Help me write the report?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.800
Yes, I'll read it and help you with
the report,but you have to read it, too.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.500
But you have to read it too.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.900
Were you even listening
to that sermon today?

13:56.900 --> 13:58.700
It was about personal responsibility.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.700
That sermon was about making
Grace look good in the church

14:01.700 --> 14:04.800
'cause Reverend Stone wants her
daddy to keep giving him money.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.200
See, the church needs money from
people like Grace's family to survive.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.100
Hi. Can we talk?

14:12.100 --> 14:14.400
The two of us?
Just for a second before I leave.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.900
Be right back. I gotta
make a phone call.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.700
I gotta call my house and
let 'em know where I am.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.800
I'm sure.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.000
Excuse me.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.300
Excuse me.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.400
What happened to Ricky?
Nothing. We're just friends.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.000
- I'm sure.
- You wanted to talk to me?

14:32.200 --> 14:36.200
I wanted you to know that my friend may
be staying here with us a couple of weeks.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.500
Ugh.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.500
I'm not asking for your
permission or your opinion.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.300
I'm just letting you know.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.000
Fine. As long as he doesn't
stay here while you're gone...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.600
'cause if he is,I'm staying somewhere else.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.800
He's a perfectly nice man,and he has a 
daughter about your age at your school,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.900
so I hope you don't say
anything to anyone, OK?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.800
He and his wife are having some problems,

14:56.800 --> 15:00.200
and he just needs a place to
stay while he can find something.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.400
Yeah, 'cause God knows there
aren't any apartments or hotels 

15:03.400 --> 15:05.100
or anything like that in the area.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.500
He's nice, OK? And I like him.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.000
And he's the kind of friend that...

15:13.100 --> 15:15.000
Well, it could turn into something more.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.600
Yeah, provided he leaves his wife.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.900
For your information,
he already left his wife.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.200
And his daughter,
the one I go to school with.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.400
Isn't this the guy that
owns a furniture store?

15:25.400 --> 15:28.700
Yes, and he has two daughters,
Amy and Ashley.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.700
Ashley is... 12 or 13.13.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.100
And Amy's a year younger than you.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.900
And he left them and his wife for you.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.800
You think that'll really work out?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.400
I could come back if...

15:44.400 --> 15:47.100
No, no, no, no, it's-it's... OK.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.700
I'll be back in a couple of days.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.800
???

15:51.800 --> 15:53.900
??

15:53.900 --> 15:55.900
Yeah, I... I almost forgot.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.700
I love you.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.500
Mm-hmm.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
Bye, Jack.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.200
Bye.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.500
Your mom seems nice.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.500
She's not, and we're never
gonna talk about my mom - ever.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.100
What about your mom?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.200
- Were you parents at church today?
- Parents?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
Um, yeah. Yeah, they were there.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.500
Don't you know who my dad -
my stepdad is?

16:38.000 --> 16:38.800
N... No.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.100
Uh, Reverend Stone?

16:40.600 --> 16:41.900
No way.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.200
- What do you mean, no way? Yeah.
- Your last name is not Stone.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.400
My mom met him at grief
counseling after my dad died.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.000
I couldn't have gotten over my dad's 
death without the help of Reverend Stone.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.100
- And the love of Jesus Christ, of course.
- Of course.

16:55.100 --> 17:01.800
So... I was thinking maybe... my dad,
I mean, my stepdad could help you.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.099
Help me what? I don't know.

17:05.099 --> 17:08.300
Did your stepfather ask you to
date Grace, or was that your idea?

17:08.300 --> 17:12.000
Doesn't matter whose idea it was.
I wanted to date her.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.400
Doesn't matter to you.
Might matter to her.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.400
- What's wrong?
- Where's Mom?

17:32.600 --> 17:33.500
She's in her room.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
Have you been crying?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.000
Ben asked me to marry him.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.200
You're 15.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.000
And I'm having a baby.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.500
Mom's gonna hear you, OK? Just...

17:49.200 --> 17:50.600
Y-You told him?

17:50.900 --> 17:54.800
His father suspected, and I don't
know what difference it makes.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.400
He knows. Pretty soon,
everybody's gonna know.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.300
Might as well just get it over with
and tell Mom while Dad's gone.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.800
You know he's gone?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.800
Mm-hmm. To, like, Vegas
or something like that.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.000
N-No, Amy.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.800
God, how can you be so...

18:10.400 --> 18:13.000
I don't know. 
What's the word? Clueless.

18:13.000 --> 18:13.800
He left her.

18:15.300 --> 18:16.900
He... he left us. I know that.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.600
- I just said I know that.
- No, you don't get it.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.400
He's not coming back.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.600
Ashley, he is. He's coming back in,
like, a couple of days or something.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.100
He's cheating on her,
and he's left her for someone.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.000
Dad?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.200
Yes,dad.Our dad.
Dad's having an affair.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.400
Ohh.

18:38.100 --> 18:38.900
Shut up.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.100
Ashley...

18:41.700 --> 18:44.900
who would want to have sex with Dad
if they didn't have to?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.400
I know it's not funny.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.900
I must just be losing it.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.600
I don't think I can have this baby.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.000
I don't know what to do.

19:14.700 --> 19:18.700
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
Don't have the baby.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.600
??

19:33.600 --> 19:34.400
Don't do it.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.000
I have to. I don't have any choice.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.500
You do have a choice.
I'm giving you a choice.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.300
What, your Dad will let you
get married? I don't see why not.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.700
Because yoyou're 15,and I'm
pregnant by some other guy.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.600
I love you, and he knows that.He and
my mom were high school sweetheararts.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.500
He gets it. It'll be fine.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.100
Even if your dad did
let you marry me,

19:52.100 --> 19:55.800
it's not gonna solve anything,because
my parents will never let me get married.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.600
I mean, they'll probably send me off
to some home when the baby gets adopted

19:58.600 --> 20:00.400
and just tell all their
friends I have a disease

20:00.400 --> 20:02.100
and I'm there for treatment or something.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.100
I'll tell them with you,

20:03.400 --> 20:05.000
and I'll tell them I wanna marry you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.600
And I'll even ask my Dad to
come if you think that'll help.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.200
And no one is gonna send you off
to any other home other than mine,

20:11.400 --> 20:14.100
and no one can make you give up
your baby if you don't want to.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.600
Ben, why are you so nice to me?

20:17.100 --> 20:18.000
I love you.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.000
Then please help me get rid of this baby.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Shh. No. No abortion.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.400
I'd rather do that than tell my parents.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.200
I never thought I could,
but I think I have to.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.900
I know I'm being a coward, but...

20:32.300 --> 20:33.700
I cannot tell them, Ben.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.600
I have to.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.100
You don't know them.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.400
I have to do this.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.800
OK, of course.
You have to make the decision,

20:42.800 --> 20:46.300
but I don't think this is
a decision you wanna make.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.700
You don't have to.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.400
Maybe it's what I want to do.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.100
Maybe it's the easiest thing.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.600
Yeah, maybe, but maybe not.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.700
We need to talk.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.000
Uh, about what?

20:59.900 --> 21:00.800
It's personal.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.200
Personal? Personal how?

21:03.200 --> 21:04.800
I'll give you a ride home from school, OK?

21:05.800 --> 21:07.100
My mom's picking me up.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.600
Tell her you have a ride.
I wanna talk to you.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.400
About what?

21:12.200 --> 21:14.000
Boykewich? Isn't that your name?

21:14.600 --> 21:18.600
This is between me and Amy. It's
a private conversation. Butt out.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.000
Butt out. Excuse m-

21:20.500 --> 21:23.500
Uh, OK. I'll meet you in the
parking lot after practice.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.400
OK. See ya.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.700
What? She probably knows.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.100
How? How would she know?

21:32.100 --> 21:34.600
I don't know. How does
anybody know? How did you know?

21:34.900 --> 21:36.100
Maybe no one knows.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
Ben, look at me. It's so obvious.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.000
Oh. We'll catch up later.

21:44.700 --> 21:45.600
Do they know?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.100
Of course they know.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.300
Oh.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.600
They won't tell anybody.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.500
I mean, they didn't even talk
about Ricky and me at band camp.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.400
He was the one going
around talking about it.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.500
What?

21:56.500 --> 21:57.800
I'm not sure he was.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.100
Then how did people find out?

22:00.300 --> 22:01.000
I don't know.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.900
I could be mistaken, but...

22:03.900 --> 22:06.200
I think your two best
friends are a little chatty.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.700
No, they told me to my face
that they didn't tell anyone.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.800
Don't criticize my friends.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.400
W-Why would they tell anyone?

22:14.700 --> 22:16.300
No. No, they wouldn't do that.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.800
You know 'em better than I do.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.500
How did you find out? Who told you?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.900
What difference does it make?

22:24.900 --> 22:26.200
My two best friends told me.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.500
And they heard it from?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.000
I don't know.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.700
All right, well, they didn't
hear it from Madison or Lauren.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.200
I'll call you later, after I get home.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.200
Where were you yesterday?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.000
At the park with my woman.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.300
People think you two are doing it.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.200
What people?

22:57.200 --> 22:58.500
High-school people.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.800
So?

22:59.800 --> 23:01.700
So? She's lookin' a little...

23:03.200 --> 23:04.100
bigger these days.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.000
She's put on a pound or two.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.200
Don't say it.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.100
So you know.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.600
- Is it yours or that drummer's?
- Why?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.900
Why you wanna bet on who's baby it is?

23:14.900 --> 23:18.700
It's mine. ??? Here,
here's $20 to leave me alone.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.300
- I can't keep this.
- I don't want it.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.600
You know he's gonna try to marry her?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.000
Yeah, mm-hmm.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.200
Oh, she is not.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.100
Oh, I think she is.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.200
I don't think we should
be talking about it.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.200
I mean if she is, it's so sad.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.600
And why do you think I'm telling
you, 'cause it's so sad?

23:40.400 --> 23:42.800
So, who do you think the father is?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.200
I don't know. Her boyfriend, I guess.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
If she is pregnant,

23:47.300 --> 23:49.500
really, it's ridiculous.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.600
It's not Jack, is it?
Please tell me it's not Jack.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.900
Are you not over that idiot yet?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.000
I don't know.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
Did I tell you he brought her
to church with him yesterday?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.500
Amy Juergens?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.100
No, with Adrian.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.300
Are you kidding me?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.600
First, he gets oral from her,
then takes her to church?

24:06.500 --> 24:07.100
Wow.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
A kiss.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.100
It was just a kiss.
The whole school saw it.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.900
Oh, Grace, are you that naive?

24:14.900 --> 24:17.900
You think I'm naive just because I won't
wanna believe the worst in everybody?

24:17.900 --> 24:21.300
He told the guys in the
locker room, guys told people,

24:21.500 --> 24:22.600
people told me.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.100
There are no secrets in high school.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.300
- Oh.
- ??

24:42.300 --> 24:43.500
Hey, slow down.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.800
When Jack and Adrian kissed outside
the dance in front of everyone,

24:45.800 --> 24:47.200
do you think they were
doing something else?

24:47.800 --> 24:50.400
I mean ?? they weren't just kissing?
??? They were doing something else?

24:50.600 --> 24:53.700
- Hey, what difference does it make?
- What difference does it make?

24:53.700 --> 24:56.800
Calm down. Come on, walk with me.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.600
He told me it was just a kiss.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.700
Hey, people are listening.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.200
He lied to me.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.200
People do that, Grace.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.900
People lie. They tell lies to
make life more interesting

25:04.900 --> 25:07.300
when the truth would probably be
more interesting than the lie.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.800
Yeah, well. I wanna get the truth.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.600
I doubt it.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.700
You doubt it?

25:10.700 --> 25:11.400
What is the truth?

25:11.400 --> 25:13.700
Did she seduce him?
Did he seduce her?

25:13.900 --> 25:15.900
Did they have sex?
Did they not have sex?

25:15.900 --> 25:18.100
I want answers, and I
want the truth this time.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.000
Everyone has their own
versions of the truth. ??

25:21.400 --> 25:23.000
No one tells the truth all the time.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.100
Still, there's only one truth,
and no matter what story you tell,

25:25.100 --> 25:27.800
there's truth, and then
there's lies. I want the truth.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.900
That's what you wanted
before, and you got a lie,

25:29.900 --> 25:31.900
so why is this time
gonna be any different?

25:31.900 --> 25:33.700
Your friend is a really bad girl.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.300
Your friend's a really bad guy.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.000
So what?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.900
People are what they are,
and people are good and bad.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.100
Except for you, Grace.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.800
You're the exception. You're
the only good person I know.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.600
If your parents would let
me come over tonight,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.700
I'd love to hear
your personal testimony.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.800
You would?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.700
Why?

25:56.200 --> 25:59.200
Because if it's your personal
relationship with Jesus Christ

25:59.200 --> 26:02.300
that makes you such a good person, then...

26:03.100 --> 26:04.000
I don't know,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.100
maybe I need to make
some changes in my life.

26:06.700 --> 26:07.800
Oh, Ricky...

26:08.300 --> 26:10.400
I need you, Grace. I need a friend.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
Make me worthy of being your friend.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.100
I would love to witness
to you, and I will.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.400
But first, I have to go kick Jack's butt.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.500
We saw you talking to Ben.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.300
We didn't wanna interrupt.
We thought it looked important.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.200
Did you tell him?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.600
Yes, I told him.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
What did he say?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.900
Did you guys tell anyone
what's going on with me?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.000
- No.
- No.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.100
Are you sure?

26:45.300 --> 26:46.900
Amy, you're gaining weight.

26:46.900 --> 26:47.700
And?

26:48.600 --> 26:50.400
OK, what's your point, Lauren?

26:50.400 --> 26:54.400
My point is that if people think
you're pregnant, that's not our fault.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.000
If they think that. We don't
even know if they think that.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.900
Wait. Are people saying that?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.900
Are people saying that I'm... you know...

27:03.900 --> 27:06.500
We're not in the popular group exactly,

27:06.500 --> 27:08.200
so we really don't know
what they're saying,

27:08.600 --> 27:11.000
but, uh, we have heard
some people talk and...

27:11.000 --> 27:11.900
Yes.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.000
Maybe you should just go home.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, maybe I should
just go home, stay home.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.200
I mean that's what would happen.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.100
If I left right now
in the middle of the day,

27:26.800 --> 27:28.400
I don't think I could ever come back.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.900
You know, if I stay and
nothing ever happens, ??

27:33.500 --> 27:36.000
then, you know, maybe people will
just think it was like a rumor

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
and that it wasn't true or anything.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.400
OK, what are you talking about?

27:39.900 --> 27:42.800
Are you talking about what I think you're
talking about, because I'm Catholic.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.500
Yeah, well, she's not.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
Help me.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.700
I can't help you. I don't
know anything about it.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.800
You can't.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.900
I have to. I mean are you
guys gonna help me or not?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.800
How?

27:58.800 --> 28:01.200
I don't know where to go.
I don't know how to...

28:01.900 --> 28:03.000
get it done.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.100
By "it," do you mean an abortion?

28:05.100 --> 28:08.200
It's her choice, Madison,
and it's a valid choice

28:08.200 --> 28:11.700
considering her age and the father.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.000
I need help.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.200
I can't. I mean, I love
you, Amy, but I can't.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.100
You can't.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.400
Tell your mother. Tell her today.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.700
Maybe at this point, maybe you
really should tell your mom.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.800
So that's it?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.900
That's how you guys are going to help me?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.600
By telling me that
I need to tell my mother?

28:32.700 --> 28:34.300
I can't tell my mother.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.000
You guys, my dad left us last night.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.200
Oh, my gosh.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.100
A divorce, abortion. What's next?

28:49.300 --> 28:50.300
I don't know.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.400
But what I do know is that

28:52.400 --> 28:55.600
this is not what I wanted my
high-school experience to be.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.400
Amy Juergens?

29:03.600 --> 29:06.300
Hey. I was wondering if we could talk.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.900
Um, about?

29:07.900 --> 29:09.800
You've got study hall
fifth period, right?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.900
Could you come by my office
instead of going to study hall?

29:13.300 --> 29:16.000
- I'll give a note to class.
- Yeah, I guess.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.700
Great. I'll meet you here.

29:37.100 --> 29:37.800
Yeah.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.400
Hello?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.600
You shouldn't have your
cell phone on at school.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.400
I was gonna leave you a message.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.200
Dad?

29:54.200 --> 29:56.700
Aw, sweetie, don't cry.
I didn't want to upset you.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.400
I just wanted to say hi.

29:58.700 --> 29:59.700
Where are you?

29:59.700 --> 30:02.700
In Vegas. Remember I told you
I had to come to Vegas?

30:03.700 --> 30:04.900
I'll call you when I get back.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.600
Dad, when are you coming home?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.400
I'll call you when I get back.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
She answered.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.200
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.300
I know how hard this must be.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.400
Let me make this easier for you.

30:37.000 --> 30:37.700
Hello?

30:37.700 --> 30:39.800
Amy? Dr. Hightower.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.200
I already took care of it, OK?

30:45.100 --> 30:46.200
You did what?

30:46.600 --> 30:48.300
Just don't call me again.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.200
You wanted to see me?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.800
Oh, hey, yeah. Come on in.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.300
Please sit down.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.800
Uh, look, it's taken me a few weeks
to go through all the student files...

31:21.200 --> 31:22.400
What, all of them?

31:22.600 --> 31:23.100
Mm-hmm.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.900
So not just mine?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.500
No, not just yours.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.400
But I did happen to notice yours
particular for a couple reasons.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.800
You've done an excellent job of
mapping out your educational goals.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
You ultimately wanna go to Julliard?

31:36.200 --> 31:38.200
Yeah, eventually.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.300
Hoping to make the All-State
Orchestra this year,

31:41.300 --> 31:43.700
and if I can keep that up
through high school,

31:43.700 --> 31:47.400
keep my grades up and do good on the
SATs, then hopefully I'll get accepted.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.600
Great, and after you graduate Julliard?

31:49.600 --> 31:53.000
Well, my dream would be to play
in the New York Philharmonic.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.200
Excellent. ?? It's
really good to have goals.

31:57.100 --> 32:01.000
It's even better to plan out the steps
along the way to reach those goals.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.800
I just want you to know that
sometimes there are missteps.

32:05.100 --> 32:08.800
Sometimes obstacles get in the way.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.900
And when that happens, when
you hit a bump in the road,

32:12.200 --> 32:14.600
??? that's what I'm here for -
to help you navigate.

32:15.100 --> 32:15.900
OK.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.100
So...

32:17.100 --> 32:20.100
any problems since you started school?
Anything I can help you with?

32:22.300 --> 32:26.000
No. I-I-I don't have problems.

32:26.000 --> 32:26.800
All right.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.800
And I guess you have
friends here at school?

32:31.300 --> 32:33.100
Yes.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.300
And everything OK at home?

32:37.500 --> 32:38.800
Good, good.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.400
I just want you know that I'm here.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.300
I'm always here.

32:45.100 --> 32:48.900
I get in before school starts,
and I'm here after school is over

32:48.900 --> 32:50.700
for a couple hours, so...

32:51.800 --> 32:55.500
if you ever wanna talk or I
can help you in any way...

32:58.100 --> 32:59.200
...the door's open.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.700
So that's it?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.400
That's it.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.100
Great.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.300
Thanks.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.700
Is it yours?

33:27.800 --> 33:28.800
Is what mine?

33:30.800 --> 33:32.600
The whole school is talking about it.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.700
She's not pregnant.

33:34.900 --> 33:35.900
She's not.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.400
Did she say she is, sir?

33:37.700 --> 33:39.800
She didn't say anything
about being pregnant.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.700
I hoped that she might, but she didn't.

33:42.000 --> 33:42.900
Because she's not.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.100
She's just, uh... a
little pudgy, that's all.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.100
Pudgy.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.000
Yeah.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.000
Pudgy, not pregnant.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.600
Then why are you hanging out
watching my office?

33:53.600 --> 33:55.700
I'm not stalking you, if
that's what you were thinking.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.700
I was just going to the bathroom.
Here's my bathroom pass.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.300
- The men's room isn't on this hall.
- Yeah, I know.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.000
I was just taking the long way 'round.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.900
I'm really not that interested
in American History.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.600
It's mostly lies, too, like the
rumors going around this school.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.199
Lies.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.600
I'm gonna give you some advice.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.199
You don't have to take it, but
I'm gonna give it to you, anyway.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.800
Are we talking about colleges here?
'Cause I'm still a freshman.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.699
And it's still ?? early in the game.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.400
All right. Shoot.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.900
It's not your decision to make.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.100
You might wanna have some
say in the decision,

34:37.100 --> 34:39.199
you might wanna express your opinion,

34:39.400 --> 34:41.600
but it's not your decision to make.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.900
Encourage Amy to talk
to her parents right away.

34:46.300 --> 34:49.199
And you go along with
whatever it is she wants to do.

34:50.199 --> 34:54.199
Or commit to taking responsibility
for the next 18 years and beyond.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.400
I should be talking to Ricky, shouldn't I?

35:06.700 --> 35:07.800
I'm sorry, kid.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.600
I'm really sorry.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.500
- About what?
- About everything.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.200
High school stinks.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.200
For some crazy reason, I actually
thought I could make it better.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.900
??? give her a ride?

35:56.900 --> 35:57.900
Why can't someone else?

35:57.900 --> 35:59.600
Maybe I wanna give her a ride.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.800
?? You shouldn't hang out
with girls like that.

36:02.000 --> 36:02.900
Girls like what?

36:02.900 --> 36:04.200
Girls like Amy Juergens.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.200
What's wrong with Amymy Juergens?

36:06.200 --> 36:07.200
Come on, you haven't heard?

36:07.500 --> 36:08.600
Heard what?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.400
Don't you have any girlfriends?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.500
No, I don't. I don't want any girlfriends.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.600
You're not even friends
with the other majorettes?

36:14.600 --> 36:15.800
Not really, no.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.400
They're not as good as I
am, and they know it.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.600
They're jealous, they're
petty, and they're mean.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.800
You never notice how much better I am?

36:24.300 --> 36:27.300
You never notice I do
all the solo performances?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.800
You know, I really don't pay
attention to the baton twirling.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
I'm kind of paying attention
to the game, you know?

36:32.600 --> 36:34.200
What's wrong with Amy Juergens?

36:34.200 --> 36:35.800
She's pregnant. She's having a baby.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.200
- Amy Juergens?
- Amy Juergens.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.200
Huh.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.200
Yikes.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.400
Don't run away from me.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.100
I'll just run after you, both of you.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.700
Who's running?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
I can't believe I was so stupid
to think that ?? just kissed.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.700
Me, neither.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.500
He told me, he told me that's all
that was going on, just kissing.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.900
Mm, please. This is so boring.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.000
Is it? It's boring to you when
you ruin somebody else's life?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.800
Did someone here ruin your life?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.300
Yeah, he did. Jack did.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.800
He was my boyfriend, my first
boyfriend, and he cheated on me

37:12.800 --> 37:15.600
and lied to me, and I in turn
had to lie to my parents,

37:15.600 --> 37:17.300
and now I don't know if they're
ever gonna trust me again

37:17.300 --> 37:19.500
or if I'm ever gonna trust
another guy ever again.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.000
And yet you're friends with Ricky.

37:21.000 --> 37:21.800
You trust him?

37:21.800 --> 37:23.500
- At least he's honest.
- Is he?

37:23.800 --> 37:26.200
Then ask him if he's the
father of Amy Juergens' baby.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.100
Have you seen Amy?

37:33.800 --> 37:36.200
Juergens. Amy Juergens,
the French horn player.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.000
She didn't show up for practice.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.400
So Amy's really having a baby?

37:43.400 --> 37:44.100
Yeah.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.900
So run along and tell mommy.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.300
You win, Grace.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.100
You're the good girl, and Amy isn't.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.200
Although when you tell your parents,

37:50.200 --> 37:52.700
I doubt you'll be able to
see Ricky anymore, huh?

37:52.900 --> 37:56.900
No, it has to be Ben's. Ricky
would never make a mistake like that.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.500
And I would know.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.000
I guess you would know
about her, too, huh?

38:02.500 --> 38:05.100
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Oh, shut up, Grace.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.700
I'm tired of being ashamed of myself.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.700
I've been ashamed of myself my
whole life, so just shut up.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.300
?? Is that too honest for you?

38:13.100 --> 38:14.400
Thought you liked honesty.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.600
So let me tell you something else.

38:17.300 --> 38:20.000
I only went out with you
'cause my stepdad asked me to.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.100
He wanted to make sure

38:22.100 --> 38:24.900
you and your perfect little
family were happy at church.

38:26.700 --> 38:27.900
How's that for honesty?

38:41.700 --> 38:42.600
Yeah.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.600
Ah, well, look who's here,

38:47.800 --> 38:49.900
just minutes before my next appointment.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.700
You should've called, Ricky.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
I wanna talk to you.
But what's goin' on?

38:55.500 --> 38:58.300
- I'll come back.
- Good, good. Yeah, you come back.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.700
But before you go, what's goin' on?

39:03.700 --> 39:04.800
I, um...

39:06.500 --> 39:08.900
I heard this rumor that
I got a girl pregnant.

39:11.100 --> 39:15.100
Ah. Um, is there any truth to that rumor?

39:16.100 --> 39:17.000
Maybe.

39:19.300 --> 39:20.100
Sit down.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.600
I'll cancel the next appointment.

39:39.000 --> 39:39.700
Amy.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.000
Just...

39:44.000 --> 39:45.300
Staring at the moon?

39:45.900 --> 39:46.800
Kind of.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.600
I used to do that a lot when I was little,

39:49.600 --> 39:50.900
just stare at the moon.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.600
Seemed like the perfect
place to run away to,

39:54.600 --> 39:58.100
place where I could eat freeze-
dried ice cream and drink Tang.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.300
Bounce around all day.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.900
You really thought about
running away to the moon?

40:02.900 --> 40:03.800
Oh, yeah.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.400
There was no place on earth far enough
away from whatever was bothering me.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.300
You thinking about running
away to the moon?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.100
I wasn't, but...

40:16.400 --> 40:18.200
you made it sound like so much fun.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.300
Good night, Mom.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.900
I love you, Amy,

40:28.600 --> 40:30.300
no matter what happens.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.400
N-No matter w-w-w-what happens?

40:33.400 --> 40:34.400
With your father.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.400
I want you to remember that I love you

40:39.000 --> 40:40.300
and he loves you, too,

40:41.600 --> 40:42.400
OK?

40:43.200 --> 40:43.900
Good night.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.400
Hi, Amy Juergens.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.500
Ben Boykewich here.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.000
Huh,

41:17.500 --> 41:19.100
remember the first time I called you?

41:19.700 --> 41:21.200
Seems like a million years ago.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.500
But when we're married and we
spend like 75 years together,

41:26.700 --> 41:28.000
it'll seem like yesterday.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.700
OK. Well... 

41:32.700 --> 41:35.100
Come on, marry me.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.700
People used to get married
when they were 14, didn't they?

41:39.300 --> 41:40.000
I don't know,

41:40.800 --> 41:43.600
kings and queens and
pharaohs or something.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.900
Mayans. I don't know.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I just know I love you

41:52.600 --> 41:55.300
and the offer of marriage
is good for a lifetime.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.900
So you just let me know when and where,

41:57.900 --> 42:00.100
and the two of us will take off together.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.800
OK.

42:04.100 --> 42:04.900
Good night.
