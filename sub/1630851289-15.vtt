♪ ♪

00:21.413 --> 00:22.688
(Bob groans)

00:22.915 --> 00:24.523
You're a little groan-ier
than usual this morning, Dad.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.175
(yawns) I didn't sleep great
last night.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.527
Yeah, look at your eyes.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.012
The airlines would charge you
extra for those bags.

00:31.090 --> 00:32.272
Why couldn't you sleep?

00:32.441 --> 00:33.515
Were you thinking about
all the regrets you have?

00:33.683 --> 00:34.941
So many, I'm guessing.

00:35.094 --> 00:36.976
Yeah, but also, sometimes

00:37.129 --> 00:38.945
your mom can get a little kicky.

00:39.098 --> 00:40.205
Oh, no, was I kicking?

00:40.357 --> 00:42.357
A little. A lot. Very hard.

00:42.451 --> 00:44.543
Well, I was dreaming
that I was a flapper.

00:44.694 --> 00:45.952
And you kicked Dad in his flaps?

00:46.105 --> 00:47.195
-Sorry, hon.
-I mean,

00:47.289 --> 00:48.455
I'm tired, but it's fine.

00:48.607 --> 00:50.532
I'll just drink coffee
pretty much all day.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.533
That's healthy, right?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.793
Yup, totally. Hey, guys,

00:52.945 --> 00:54.369
does anyone have a bunch
of extra shelves

00:54.388 --> 00:55.870
-they want to give me?
-LINDA: Why?

00:55.890 --> 00:58.373
'Cause I am going to be winning
a ton of prizes at school

00:58.467 --> 01:00.208
and I'm gonna need a place
to put them all.

01:00.286 --> 01:02.394
We're starting a special unit
on ancient Greece today,

01:02.546 --> 01:06.214
and I hear Ms. Padaro is pretty
generous with the "prizolas."

01:06.233 --> 01:08.716
She really is. Who do you think
I got my mood ring from?

01:08.811 --> 01:11.295
-It was from her.
-Yeah, that unit
was the highlight

01:11.313 --> 01:12.796
of my fourth grade.
Well, that and winning

01:12.815 --> 01:15.132
the long-distance pee-pee
contest in the boys' room,

01:15.150 --> 01:17.892
but I didn't win for accuracy,
I won for artistry.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.136
Also, I was alone.

01:19.229 --> 01:20.579
Louise, I think you're
gonna like Ms. Padaro.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.414
You learn all about
the Greek gods and goddesses

01:22.641 --> 01:23.990
and how annoyed they always were
with everyone.

01:24.159 --> 01:26.752
Yeah, just learning the steps to
becoming a god would be great.

01:26.903 --> 01:29.479
You can be whatever you set
your mind to be, sweetie.

01:29.481 --> 01:31.906
Right, but maybe
not a Greek god?

01:32.075 --> 01:34.501
Maybe not, maybe yes.
Who knows, Bob?

01:34.653 --> 01:37.654
Don't squash her dreams,
you puny human man.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.005
I'm gonna strike him down first.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.006
BOB:
Mm.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.749
So Greece-y in here.

01:41.844 --> 01:44.661
I'm sitting next to Louise.
I'm sitting next to Louise.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.271
And I'm sitting next to you.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.014
Okay, so, for the next
two weeks,

01:48.167 --> 01:49.424
you are ancient Greeks,

01:49.593 --> 01:52.185
and you will sit in the round,
as the Greeks did.

01:52.338 --> 01:54.780
Doesn't it feel more equal,
more democratic?

01:55.007 --> 01:56.615
Well, guess who
invented democracy.

01:56.692 --> 01:57.674
Miss America?

01:57.693 --> 02:00.010
-David Democracy?
-Santa Claus?

02:00.028 --> 02:01.787
Uh, no, but good guesses.

02:01.938 --> 02:03.771
Um, the ancient Greeks
invented it.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.458
Did you hear Ms. Padaro has
a bunch of prizes you can win?

02:06.610 --> 02:07.609
Oh, I've heard.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.353
When is she gonna talk
about the coins?

02:09.371 --> 02:10.537
I know, right?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.946
I have a question
about the coins and prizes.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.132
That's my question.

02:13.359 --> 02:14.967
-(overlapping chatter)
-Okay, okay.

02:15.118 --> 02:16.860
I will be quizzing you
throughout the unit,

02:16.879 --> 02:20.288
and if you give the right
answer, you get one of these.

02:20.382 --> 02:21.214
Nice.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.716
I made these clay replicas

02:22.885 --> 02:24.868
of ancient Greek coins,
and you can

02:24.961 --> 02:26.979
trade them in
for prizes at this...

02:27.130 --> 02:28.538
-market.
-STUDENTS: Whoa!

02:28.557 --> 02:29.648
Prizes.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.299
They look like they're
from the dollar store,

02:31.318 --> 02:32.893
so you know they're expensive.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.544
It might finally be time
for me to take a whack

02:34.563 --> 02:36.380
at this class
participation thing.

02:36.398 --> 02:39.883
Also, at the end of the unit,
we'll have a huge symposium,

02:39.902 --> 02:40.993
aka party.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.070
The god Dionysus will keep
the grape juice flowing.

02:44.239 --> 02:45.647
-(all exclaiming)
-Oh, man!

02:45.741 --> 02:49.001
All right, who can tell me
what that building is? Chloe.

02:49.228 --> 02:50.502
-The Parthenon?
-Correct.

02:50.654 --> 02:51.653
Whoa.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.247
And the Parthenon
is part of a larger group

02:54.400 --> 02:56.675
of historic buildings
called the...

02:56.902 --> 02:57.734
-(students straining)
-Tommy.

02:57.753 --> 02:59.178
-The Acropolis?
-Correct.

02:59.329 --> 03:00.737
In the round? (scoffs)

03:00.906 --> 03:02.681
More like she should
turn around, am I right? Sheesh.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.533
She's being a real circle jerk.

03:04.668 --> 03:07.001
Next question, I'm just gonna
jump on her like a backpack.

03:07.021 --> 03:09.079
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> All right, I'm calling it.</i>

03:09.097 --> 03:11.005
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night, Lin.

03:11.099 --> 03:13.433
(sighs, snoring)

03:13.602 --> 03:15.585
-(grunting)
-Ow.

03:15.679 --> 03:17.178
Oh, my God, that was quick.

03:17.347 --> 03:19.105
Is she Charleston-ing?

03:19.274 --> 03:22.117
Ow. Ow. (sighs) All right.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.370
Oh, hey, Gene.
What-what are you doing up?

03:25.522 --> 03:27.781
Hello, Father. I think
I might need some nachos.

03:27.933 --> 03:30.600
No, Gene. No nachos.
Go back to sleep.

03:30.694 --> 03:32.436
Also, I don't think
we have stuff for nachos.

03:32.438 --> 03:34.213
Not with that attitude. Hold on.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.289
If you're sleeping on the couch,
that means...

03:36.366 --> 03:37.865
I could have
a sleepover at Mom's.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.201
Am I dreaming or did I hear
sleepover at Mom's?

03:40.221 --> 03:41.869
-Yup. It's on.
-Yes!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.798
You guys, seriously, be careful.
She's really kicky tonight.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.450
Oh, she wouldn't kick her kids.

03:46.468 --> 03:49.043
-She loves us.
-Is it a sleepover at Mom's?

03:49.137 --> 03:50.971
-Yup.
-(yawns) May as well.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.566
LINDA:
Aw, sleepover at Mom's?
All right!

03:54.718 --> 03:56.793
-GENE: But with
lingering Dad smell.
-Mm.

03:56.812 --> 03:58.219
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Okay,</i>

03:58.239 --> 04:00.239
Chloe and Kaylee got
called on a bunch yesterday.

04:00.466 --> 04:01.965
Maybe we try to sit
where they sat?

04:01.984 --> 04:03.575
Yeah, I want to sit
in the splash zone,

04:03.727 --> 04:05.059
but for answering questions.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.970
-Hey!
-Oh, sorry.

04:06.989 --> 04:10.323
-Um, this is my seat.
-It was your seat yesterday.

04:10.476 --> 04:12.734
Now you can go sit
in no-coins-ville.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.901
But they're all good seats.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.645
That's the beauty
of sitting in the round.

04:15.739 --> 04:17.163
Well, it's just that, yesterday,

04:17.258 --> 04:19.424
this seat got a lot of action,
and not so much over there.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.743
Let's just stay in the same
seats. Keeps things simple,

04:21.911 --> 04:24.004
but don't worry, Louise,
I see all,

04:24.156 --> 04:25.913
like the many-eyed giant, Argos.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.507
Thankfully, I don't have
that many eyes,

04:27.659 --> 04:29.601
or I'd spend
a fortune on contacts.

04:29.753 --> 04:33.438
Anyway, who knows what monster
Argos slayed? Louise.

04:33.665 --> 04:36.758
Oh... Well, I don't know
the answer to that one.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.779
Kind of skimmed the Argos stuff.
I'm gonna say Godzilla?

04:40.930 --> 04:42.172
Oh, no. Tommy.

04:42.341 --> 04:43.931
-Echidna?
-Correct.

04:44.026 --> 04:45.358
-(groans)
-Correct.

04:45.511 --> 04:47.769
-Correct. Correct.
-Dang it.

04:47.863 --> 04:49.863
The lady just doesn't see us.
It's not fair.

04:50.032 --> 04:52.349
She's like a shopping cart
with a wobbly wheel,

04:52.367 --> 04:54.442
-she just pulls to the right.
-I hate those shopping carts.

04:54.536 --> 04:57.779
Okay, the marketplace
is open for business.

04:57.947 --> 05:00.465
-Time to cash in those coins.
-Yes!

05:00.617 --> 05:02.375
I'm gonna get that eraser
that looks like a foot.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.211
I'm gonna get a temporary
tattoo. Take that, Mom.

05:05.364 --> 05:06.954
And I'm just gonna watch
everyone else

05:07.049 --> 05:10.033
-get cool things, I guess.
-This is some B.S.

05:10.126 --> 05:11.977
Some serious B.S.

05:12.204 --> 05:13.961
Some super serious B.S.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.314
If I don't get
that windup dolphin

05:15.465 --> 05:17.482
that actually swims
in a bathtub...

05:17.634 --> 05:19.634
I don't even want to think
about it. (grunts)

05:19.653 --> 05:21.711
Hey, does punching a locker
hurt your hand?

05:21.805 --> 05:24.548
-Probably. Eh, forget it.
-We got to do something.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.066
We could offer her
American cash money.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.993
I have $10 in my dad's wallet.

05:28.144 --> 05:31.312
Or... we could...
make clay coins ourselves.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.998
To... make ourselves
feel better?

05:33.225 --> 05:34.816
No, to use in class.

05:34.835 --> 05:39.004
We make our own replica coins
of Ms. Padaro's replica coins.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.672
You mean like counterfeiting?

05:40.899 --> 05:42.232
I saw that in a movie
that I wasn't supposed to watch

05:42.325 --> 05:43.416
that I watched five times.

05:43.585 --> 05:45.569
Yeah, technically,
it's counterfeiting,

05:45.587 --> 05:47.346
but look, we tried playing by
the rules, and it didn't work.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.164
What are we gonna do?
Not get coins and cool prizes?

05:50.258 --> 05:51.683
-You make a good point.
-I do.

05:51.835 --> 05:55.579
So, who's in for making our
own coins and our own justice?

05:55.597 --> 05:57.505
We're only in
fourth grade once, baby.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.173
-Plus, I'll do anything you do.
-Rudy?

05:59.342 --> 06:01.342
Count-erfeit me in. Man,

06:01.436 --> 06:02.844
this is the coolest
I've ever felt,

06:02.921 --> 06:05.697
and saying that out loud
made it less cool. Sorry. Sorry.

06:09.761 --> 06:12.095
Louise, don't you usually sit
with Gene and Tina at lunch?

06:12.114 --> 06:13.597
Rudy, this is a top secret

06:13.615 --> 06:15.949
counterfeiting
brainstorming session.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.376
I can't trust
those blabber butts.

06:17.561 --> 06:18.935
I told them you were
going through a crisis,

06:19.028 --> 06:20.545
and you needed
special lunch counseling.

06:20.697 --> 06:22.530
Why am I the one who needs
special lunch counseling?

06:22.699 --> 06:23.623
I'm fine.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.276
-Poor Rudy. He looks terrible.
-Mm-hmm.

06:26.369 --> 06:27.794
Okay, first thing's first,

06:27.888 --> 06:29.279
we got to make a mold
of a clay coin.

06:29.372 --> 06:30.947
How the H are we gonna do that?

06:30.966 --> 06:33.450
-Millie, can I have
a piece of gum?
-From my mouth or fresh?

06:33.468 --> 06:35.285
-How about fresh.
-Weird, but okay.

06:35.378 --> 06:37.211
Rudy, you got a quarter
or a nickel or something?

06:37.231 --> 06:40.399
If I had a nickel for every time
you asked me for a quarter...

06:40.626 --> 06:42.550
-Uh, sorry. Here you go.
-(spits)

06:42.569 --> 06:44.903
RUDY:
I hope you're gonna
wipe that off.

06:45.054 --> 06:46.646
Now, you see the impression
this makes? If this gum

06:46.798 --> 06:49.074
was a hard mold, we could
press clay in there,

06:49.225 --> 06:51.317
and it would be
the exact shape of a quarter.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.561
So, all we need
is some gold-colored clay,

06:53.655 --> 06:56.397
a hard mold, and one
of Ms. Padaro's coins.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.491
-And the blood of a virgin.
-What's a virgin?

06:58.644 --> 07:01.086
I think it's someone
who gives a lot of blood.

07:01.163 --> 07:02.904
Oh. My grandfather's a virgin.

07:02.998 --> 07:05.815
I love TV,
and if you're about to say,

07:05.834 --> 07:07.150
"Well, then
why don't you marry it?"

07:07.169 --> 07:08.576
you should know
that we're engaged.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.411
All right, my family.
It's getting late.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.988
-Time for bed.
-You know, I actually

07:12.007 --> 07:13.915
slept really well last night
here on the couch.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.583
Um, I think I'm gonna
do that again.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.678
Aw, okay, Mr. Couching Tiger,
Sleeping Dragon.

07:18.830 --> 07:21.498
You kids want to have
another sleepover at Mom's?

07:21.591 --> 07:24.000
-Yeah!
-Hmm, let me check my schedule.

07:24.093 --> 07:25.351
Just kidding. I'm available.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.853
You guys didn't get
kicked last night?

07:27.005 --> 07:28.947
Of course I'm not gonna
kick them, Bob. They're my kids.

07:29.207 --> 07:31.524
Well, actually you did,
a little, but it felt nice.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.360
-It was like shiatsu.
-I'm gonna take a rain check.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.104
Got to rest up for
ancient Greece class tomorrow

07:37.166 --> 07:38.682
because I'm a good student.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.460
Wow. Our great parenting
just started to work,

07:41.611 --> 07:44.204
with one of you. The rest of you
little delinquents come with me.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.706
-Yay!
-Hey, we can play
"Never Have I Ever."

07:46.800 --> 07:50.302
I'll start. Never have I ever
played "Never Have I Ever."

Oh, this is nice.

08:03.299 --> 08:05.466
This is very, very nice.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.044
"Forget everything
you know about pepper."

08:08.213 --> 08:09.470
(yawns) Okay.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.549
That might be enough
reading for tonight.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.034
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> All right,</i>

08:14.219 --> 08:15.309
let's get that coin. Ms. Padaro,

08:15.329 --> 08:18.330
may I be excused
to visit the restroom?

08:18.481 --> 08:19.981
-Of course.
-Thank you.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.667
So, today, I'd like
to get into the gods

08:22.819 --> 08:23.576
and Mount Olympus.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.987
Um, I don't want
to alarm anyone,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.839
but there's a mouse over there!

08:27.991 --> 08:29.749
(gasps) I see it, too.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.178
I don't see it. Do you know
what a mouse looks like?

08:33.329 --> 08:34.754
RUDY:
Oh, my gosh, it was right there.

08:34.906 --> 08:35.997
-Keep looking.
-Yeah, yeah.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.240
Keep looking in that direction

08:37.333 --> 08:38.517
-and no-no other direction.
-Huh.

08:38.668 --> 08:40.852
Weird, yeah.
He must've scurried away.

08:41.004 --> 08:44.022
Sorry. And... take us back
to Greece.

08:44.766 --> 08:45.915
(grunts)

08:46.009 --> 08:47.526
A moldy but a goodie.

08:47.602 --> 08:50.011
-MS. PADARO: And Zeus
was pretty mad...
-(screams)

08:50.105 --> 08:52.513
The mouse is back! Everyone look

08:52.533 --> 08:53.848
with your eyes.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.109
And... he's gone again.

08:56.261 --> 08:58.278
-Weirdest thing.
-(sighs) Classic mouse.

08:58.430 --> 09:01.373
Coming and going
whenever it wants.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.450
I can't believe I slept
through the night last night.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.044
I mean, that's
what nights are for.

09:06.195 --> 09:07.287
No, y-you don't understand.

09:07.439 --> 09:08.880
This might be the first time

09:09.032 --> 09:11.407
I've slept all the way through
the night in possibly 15 years.

09:11.459 --> 09:13.218
Is-is this how
regular people feel?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.053
I don't know,
but you do look radiant.

09:15.204 --> 09:16.446
-I feel radiant.
-(door bells jingle)

09:16.464 --> 09:18.464
-Hi, kids.
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey-o.

09:18.617 --> 09:20.374
Uh, hey. I have
a little group project

09:20.468 --> 09:21.876
to do with Rudy and Millie.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.896
Is it okay if we go upstairs?
We really need to focus.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.547
-Uh, sure.
-I don't remember

09:26.641 --> 09:29.067
doing a group project
for the ancient Greek unit.

09:29.218 --> 09:30.384
-Do you?
-The younger generation

09:30.404 --> 09:32.979
just lives in another world,
don't they?

09:33.131 --> 09:34.480
Okay, we have our mold.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.634
We have our gold clay.
The oven is preheating.

09:37.727 --> 09:39.319
Let's make some money, people.

09:39.471 --> 09:41.246
-I'm in her room.
-We can hear you.

09:41.397 --> 09:42.639
-No, you can't.
-(grunts)

09:42.657 --> 09:44.307
LOUISE:
Come to mama.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.751
-Oh...
-She's beautiful.

09:46.903 --> 09:48.645

<i> MS. PADARO:</i>
<i> So, the Socratic method</i>

10:01.918 --> 10:05.103
is about asking questions
and challenging assumptions.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.271
There's no right answer.

10:06.498 --> 10:08.255
Well, that kind of takes
the pressure off.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.091
Ooh, we better get
to the marketplace.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.093
Yeah, o-okay, sure.
Yeah. All right.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.112
Oh, the marketplace you say?

10:14.339 --> 10:15.947
Suppose I could check it out.

10:16.174 --> 10:17.507
(chuckles nervously)

10:17.525 --> 10:19.175
What if she figures out
our coins are fake?

10:19.194 --> 10:21.177
She won't if we just
play it cool.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.179
(inhales deeply)
Take it in.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.181
Don't you just love the danger?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.625
What? No! I don't!

10:26.852 --> 10:29.443
Guys, pull it together.
This is just a test-drive.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.278
We don't want
to set off any alarms.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.023
One small thing each.

10:34.117 --> 10:35.783
Okay, who's next? Louise?

10:35.877 --> 10:38.119
-Yes. Hello.
-RUDY and MILLIE: Hi.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.213
Holy crap, it worked. It worked.

10:40.365 --> 10:42.807
-What a rush.
-Okay, so it's game on.

10:42.959 --> 10:45.727
-Now, I love school.
-I kind of want
to steal a truck.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.483
I could put this sticker
in my locker. I could put this

10:51.634 --> 10:53.151
sticker on my skateboard
if I had a skateboard.

10:53.302 --> 10:54.468
Smell this.
I love eraser smell.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.396
I can't believe
we can make our own coins

10:56.490 --> 10:59.140
-and get whatever we want.
-Guys, I love this stuff, too,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.234
but we got to keep a low profile

11:01.386 --> 11:04.070
and try to get called on
every now and then, okay?

11:04.222 --> 11:05.571
So, what are we gonna do?

11:05.666 --> 11:08.241
-(inhales deeply)
-Never stop buying stuff?
-No.

11:08.393 --> 11:09.501
We're gonna keep a low profile.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.836
No big-ticket items
and no spending sprees.

11:12.063 --> 11:13.730

wax melts,
and Icarus comes tumbling down.

I can't relate
to this story at all.

13:29.868 --> 13:31.551
Hey, friends.
Look who was feeling

13:31.645 --> 13:33.294
a little crafty last night.

13:33.371 --> 13:35.146
-RUDY: Whoa.
-LOUISE: What are you doing?

13:35.298 --> 13:37.557
We have a system.
We have quality control.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.967
You can't just make
more coins on your own.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.153
-Oh, but I did.
-Wow. No offense,

13:42.305 --> 13:43.804
but some of these
are really bad.

13:43.898 --> 13:46.640
Oh, no! Some coins aren't
the exact right perfect shape.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.567
Sue me.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.160
Millie, that one's
basically square.

13:49.312 --> 13:50.995
And I'm pretty sure
that's a penny.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.646
Okay, God!

13:52.666 --> 13:54.057
I won't use the really bad ones.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.317
That's all of them.
Okay, new rule, Millie,

13:56.411 --> 13:57.818
no using any of those coins.

13:57.912 --> 14:00.913
I didn't realize today was
bring your mother to school day.

14:01.066 --> 14:04.676
-You guys coming in?
-Yup. Get me
to the Greek, right?

14:06.905 --> 14:08.847
Whoa!

14:08.998 --> 14:10.348
(phone chimes)

14:10.425 --> 14:13.334
"Did you know peppercorns
are actually dried berries?"

14:13.353 --> 14:15.169
Aw. He loves that pepper book.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.246
"You're cute
when you read a book."

14:17.265 --> 14:18.414
Hey, if you want
to chat with Dad,

14:18.433 --> 14:19.932
I could rest my eyes
for a few hours.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.085
Yeah, I think I left
the Dutch oven on in my bed.

14:22.178 --> 14:23.361
I should go check it.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.013
No, no, no. Sorry, I'm off.
We're moisturizing.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.848
-Okay, sure.
-Great.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.275
-(phone chimes)
-Wait, hold on.

14:29.427 --> 14:31.536
"I think I might need
reading glasses."

14:31.763 --> 14:34.021
"Get them. You'll look good.

14:34.115 --> 14:36.449
Like a sexy senior citizen."

14:36.618 --> 14:38.859
Yup. I-I need glasses.

14:38.953 --> 14:42.213
The Hippocratic Oath
is named after...

14:42.365 --> 14:44.440
Oops. Did anyone
drop a coin? Huh.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.275
-This one looks
a little different.
-Millie.

14:46.294 --> 14:49.112
-What the hell?
-Uh, different how?

14:49.205 --> 14:51.538
-The shape's a little funny.
-Like "ha-ha" funny?

14:51.633 --> 14:54.617
I mean, it's-- not like
it's counterfeit. (chuckles)

14:54.710 --> 14:56.227
Yeah. No one would do that.

14:56.304 --> 14:58.287
And if it was, I did put in

14:58.289 --> 15:00.214
a little secret
security feature.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.550
Security feature? That sounds,
uh, neat. What is that?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.070
When I made my coins,
I baked in a little strip

15:06.297 --> 15:08.981
of aluminum foil,
so I'd know they were mine. See?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.408
Oh. There's no foil.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.535
That's weird. Huh...

15:13.729 --> 15:15.396
Foil.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.898
No foil. Foil.

15:17.992 --> 15:19.825
Foil. No foil.

15:19.978 --> 15:21.978
Wait, someone's making
fake coins?

15:22.071 --> 15:24.088
-Looks like it.
-Isn't that, like, bad?

15:24.315 --> 15:25.665
Yes. It's really bad.

15:25.741 --> 15:27.425
Should we call the FBI?

15:27.652 --> 15:29.485
Maybe. No, probably not.

15:29.487 --> 15:31.763
But I want whoever did this
to step forward.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.264
All right.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.099
I'll let the guilty party
sleep on it,

15:35.251 --> 15:38.252
and if no one comes forward
tomorrow, then no symposium.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.012
-No what?
-No party.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.347
-(all exclaiming)
-My heart!

15:41.499 --> 15:42.999
But what about
the bottomless grape juice?

15:43.092 --> 15:46.093
-Gone.
-What about the baklava
for days?

15:46.171 --> 15:47.353
Bakla-not gonna happen.

15:47.522 --> 15:49.530
-Aw, man.
-(others groaning)
-Oh, crap.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.511
I got to say,
I miss the cushions.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.271
Yeah, is it okay to sit on
the couch's skeleton like this?

15:57.365 --> 15:58.681
If you saw my setup
in the basement,

15:58.774 --> 16:00.866
you'd agree it's worth it,
but also, let me know

16:01.019 --> 16:02.943
-if you have any blankets
you're not using.
-(phone rings)

16:02.963 --> 16:05.296
Hello? Oh, hi, Rudy. Louise,

16:05.448 --> 16:08.024
-it's for you.
-Um, I'll take it
in the kitchen.

16:08.193 --> 16:10.209
Got it. Hello?

16:10.361 --> 16:12.303
Hey, Louise. It's Rudy.
Quick question.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.380
Do you think they'll let me
take my stuffed animal to jail

16:14.474 --> 16:16.474
because I can't sleep
without Pancake!

16:16.625 --> 16:18.309
No one's going
to jail, okay, buddy?

16:18.461 --> 16:20.294
Hold on, that's the other line.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.871
-I don't think I would like
the food there.
-Hello?

16:21.964 --> 16:23.723
I think we got to get rid of
Rudy. I think he's gonna talk.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.316
Millie, he's not
gonna talk, okay?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.819
He's on the other line, and he's
cool as a cucumber. Hold on.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.970
-Rudy, how we doing?
-I'm freaking out!

16:30.048 --> 16:31.214
Hold on. Hi, Millie.

16:31.232 --> 16:32.973
How's Rudy?
He's cracking, right?

16:33.051 --> 16:34.509
He's slightly worried.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.828
He, you know, doesn't want
to ruin the party for everyone.

16:37.055 --> 16:38.237
People can get grape juice

16:38.331 --> 16:40.072
other places in their life,
Louise, it's fine.

16:40.225 --> 16:41.240
Hey, I'm not worried about it,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.167
or feeling guilty
about it, at all.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.336
You're not gonna make a peep.
Rudy's not gonna make a peep.

16:45.488 --> 16:46.896
Anyone who makes a peep
gets hit in the head

16:46.989 --> 16:49.156
-with a lead peep.
-Okay, okay, geez.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.158
You still back there, sweetie?

16:51.252 --> 16:52.677
Oh, sorry.
I might've fallen asleep

16:52.846 --> 16:55.404
-from all the fun we're having.
-You should do what I do,

16:55.423 --> 16:57.515
-use your face as a hand.
-(phone rings)

16:57.742 --> 16:59.350
-Hi, hon.
-Hey, Lin. What-what
are you up to?

16:59.577 --> 17:02.002
Little back rub train
before bed. What about you?

17:02.096 --> 17:04.247
I was just about to go to sleep,
but I thought,

17:04.265 --> 17:05.748
you know, I'd say good night.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.084
Mm. Boy, I just realized
I-I haven't had

17:08.086 --> 17:09.752
my toothbrush in a long time.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.196
Oh, I noticed. Hey, I could
bring it down for you.

17:12.348 --> 17:14.181
You-you want to come here? Now?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.608
Yeah, I want to see
what you've done down there.

17:15.760 --> 17:19.037
Okay. Uh, great. I'll-I'll
see you in a few minutes.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.205
Oh, my God, Linda's coming over.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.266
This place is not ready
for company.

17:23.284 --> 17:26.360
Too sad. Too Dixieland-y.
Here we go.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.028
-(soft music playing)
-LINDA: Knock, knock.

17:28.197 --> 17:30.364
Ooh, it's nice down here.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.608
Look at you with the lights
and the stuff.

17:32.701 --> 17:35.278
I feel like I'm in
a dirty basement in Paris.

17:35.296 --> 17:36.445
(grunts) Ooh, it's cold, though.

17:36.464 --> 17:38.464
Yeah, it can get
a little chilly.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.207
I've been sleeping with all
the blankets I could find

17:40.226 --> 17:41.375
and three towels.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.302
-Here's your toothbrush.
-Thank you.

17:43.454 --> 17:45.730
I'll put that... here.
Would you like a drink?

17:45.915 --> 17:47.714
I'm making myself
a beer in a glass.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.902
Fancy. I'll take a wine
in a glass, if you have one,

17:50.978 --> 17:52.478
and I don't want to be forward,
but I might

17:52.630 --> 17:54.480
get in your bed real quick
'cause it's freezing.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.817
How about wine that's a beer?
And we share the glass.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.485
And it's not cold.

17:59.637 --> 18:02.655
Everything else here is cold,
but the beer is warm.

18:02.807 --> 18:04.916
-Let's see if I can... (groans)
-Oh. Okay.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.492
-All right.
-...squeeze in here. I'm in.

18:06.644 --> 18:07.977
-Oh! It's tight.
-We're both, we're both in.

18:07.995 --> 18:09.570
-I'm off! Now I'm off.
-We're both in. Oh!

18:09.664 --> 18:11.647
-Now I'm off.
-Let me, let me
pull you back up.

18:11.649 --> 18:13.816
I can be off, uh, over here
a little bit. It's fine.

18:13.835 --> 18:15.301
This is nice.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.411
I should come back
upstairs, right?

18:17.505 --> 18:19.580
Yeah, you should.
I miss your night farts.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.249
It's always three in a row.
It's comforting.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.343
Yeah, and I miss hearing
your sleep muttering.

18:24.495 --> 18:26.753
Whatever it is you're saying,
you're very emphatic.

18:26.848 --> 18:29.273
I'm not kicking anymore,
by the way. The kids are.

18:29.425 --> 18:30.775
They're kicking me like crazy.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.335
I guess they started
fighting back.

18:32.428 --> 18:33.927
Should I, uh,
bring the Christmas lights?

18:33.947 --> 18:36.005
Yeah, and the beer,
and brush your teeth.

18:36.023 --> 18:37.356
Right, right.

18:37.508 --> 18:38.783
<i> MS. PADARO:</i>
<i> Okay, everyone.</i>

18:38.934 --> 18:40.601
You had a night
to think about it.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.012
Who wants to come forward?

18:43.147 --> 18:44.513
Well, then, unfortunately,

18:44.532 --> 18:46.290
I have to call off
the symposium.

18:46.442 --> 18:48.108
-(students groan)
-Come on!
-Just say you did it,

18:48.128 --> 18:49.794
whoever you are.
I deserve a party.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.537
I haven't been to one
since Saturday.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.614
Yeah, and I'm not allowed
to have grape juice at home,

18:53.708 --> 18:54.857
so fess up!

18:54.950 --> 18:57.284
You know, I'm just--
I'm really disappointed,

18:57.362 --> 18:58.469
and the ancient Greeks
would be, too.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.547
They believed in ethics,
fairness, justice.

19:01.699 --> 19:02.974
I mean, to be honest,

19:03.125 --> 19:04.884
I don't know if I want to do
this unit again.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.036
-What do you mean?
-It's a lot of work. I mean,

19:07.054 --> 19:08.888
I buy all this stuff
with my own money.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.223
It's too much if something
like this is gonna happen.

19:11.376 --> 19:14.318
Oh, uh, well, philosophically,

19:14.470 --> 19:16.379
maybe we should
talk this through.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.472
That-That's Greek, right?
Philosophically?

19:18.566 --> 19:21.159
-Yeah.
-Well, speaking of fairness,

19:21.310 --> 19:23.402
whoever made the coins,
I'm just guessing,

19:23.554 --> 19:25.830
maybe they did it
because it wasn't quite fair

19:26.057 --> 19:27.665
the way the coins
were being handed out.

19:27.892 --> 19:29.909
I'm just using
the Socratic method.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.243
That's not the Socratic method.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.504
Uh, is it not
the Socratic method?

19:33.731 --> 19:35.064
That's the Socratic method.

19:35.082 --> 19:36.565
Oh, really? I'm just saying,

19:36.584 --> 19:40.178
I don't know, but I'm imagining
that, whoever did this,

19:40.329 --> 19:42.013
they might have had
their hand up a lot

19:42.164 --> 19:44.331
and didn't get called on
because sitting in a circle

19:44.350 --> 19:46.517
is not a great idea
because it's a bad idea.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.335
I mean, is it not a bad idea?

19:48.429 --> 19:51.004
So, hypothetically,
this person felt

19:51.082 --> 19:53.858
it was okay for them
to make fake coins?

19:54.009 --> 19:56.360
You know, Socrates said
suffering an injustice

19:56.512 --> 19:59.012
does not make it okay
to commit an injustice.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.364
Good to know, good to know.

20:00.516 --> 20:02.758
Um, maybe the people
who committed the injustice

20:02.777 --> 20:05.536
also feel bad about getting
the party canceled

20:05.613 --> 20:07.446
and also kind of
really liked the class

20:07.598 --> 20:10.208
and maybe wouldn't want you
to stop teaching it.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.359
And maybe those people
didn't sleep at all last night,

20:12.437 --> 20:14.119
even though they have Pancake.

20:14.272 --> 20:15.529
I don't know, maybe
those people don't feel

20:15.623 --> 20:17.882
any regret at all, just
adrenaline, and that's fine.

20:18.033 --> 20:21.126
Hmm. I guess the rewards thing
can be problematic.

20:21.279 --> 20:22.720
Also, at any given moment,
I can't see

20:22.947 --> 20:25.038
half the class,
and I'm nearsighted,

20:25.058 --> 20:26.724
and my hearing's not that great.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.893
Maybe this is more ethically
complicated than I thought.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.377
I'm not sure what's happening,

20:30.396 --> 20:31.395
but does that mean
we can have the party?

20:31.622 --> 20:34.047
-Uh, yeah. Okay.
-(students cheer)

20:34.067 --> 20:35.215
I guess we should accept

20:35.384 --> 20:36.734
that we may never
get to the bottom of this.

20:36.961 --> 20:39.962
Louise, Rudy, Millie, will you
see me after class? No reason.

20:39.981 --> 20:41.054
Yup. Yup. Yup.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.815
-Oh, God.
-Not a peep.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.984
-(music playing)
-(overlapping chatter)

20:45.152 --> 20:46.577
I got it, I got it.

20:46.729 --> 20:49.062
Third time you bumped the table.
(chuckles) Just saying,

20:49.156 --> 20:50.581
but, uh, have fun.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.825
Totally fair punishment,
Ms. Padaro.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.143
-Yup.
-I know.

20:54.161 --> 20:55.419
Hey, so my dad
has a laser printer.

20:55.571 --> 20:58.422
-I think we can make $30 bills.
-Bad influence!

20:58.574 --> 20:59.498
<i> Bad influence!</i>

20:59.650 --> 21:01.074
