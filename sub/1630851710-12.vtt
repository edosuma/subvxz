ever.

00:04.417 --> 00:07.334
Randall suggested that
I get myself an assistant

00:07.334 --> 00:09.876
so that I stop harassing his.

-Yes.

-Yeah.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.125
One of those dudes,
like, grabbed me.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.375
-No, I'm from Barstow.
-How you doing?

00:18.375 --> 00:20.000
-What's your name?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.375
Did you say anything
to Brock or Scheana?

00:21.375 --> 00:23.209
No, Scheana was standing
right there.

00:23.209 --> 00:25.292
She didn't say anything to him,
so I was like, what?

00:25.292 --> 00:28.292
It's not easy to, like,
tell my friends how I'm feeling,

00:28.292 --> 00:30.501
so when I do, and they don't
make it a safe space,

00:30.501 --> 00:32.209
I'm, like, what the [bleep]

00:32.209 --> 00:34.667

-Okay.

James was like, "Raquel,
don't respond to Brock's text.

I don't think we should do
the photo shoot for free."

00:40.042 --> 00:41.501
Brock has a child to pay for

00:41.501 --> 00:43.626
and hopefully
an engagement ring soon.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.501
I think that it's best
for right now

the hangouts to, like,

00:49.250 --> 00:50.959

19:45.167 --> 19:46.834
The reason why I said
Randall's movie premiere

19:46.834 --> 19:48.334
is 'cause everyone would be
dressed up nice.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.334
So I think I'll stick
with a movie theater.

19:50.334 --> 19:52.375
Why don't we just do it
in a real movie theater?

the red carpet,
