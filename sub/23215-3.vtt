16:41.217 --> 16:44.185
They have gluten-free donuts
in every flavor imaginable.

16:44.210 --> 16:46.346
It was part of your surprise.

16:46.963 --> 16:48.123
What?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.565
It doesn't matter, okay?

16:49.590 --> 16:52.227
It's too late to go now.
We don't have time.

16:53.744 --> 16:55.603
I didn't realize that was
part of the plan, all right?

16:55.628 --> 16:56.770
Thank you. That's very thoughtful.

16:56.809 --> 16:59.281
Well, happy birthday.

16:59.376 --> 17:01.309
♪ ♪

17:01.392 --> 17:03.650
I can't believe Jeff left us.

17:04.096 --> 17:05.356
What a jerk.

17:05.381 --> 17:08.214
Dude, do you realize
what just happened?

17:08.263 --> 17:10.191
Who invited us to a show?

17:10.339 --> 17:12.140
Who found a gym super fast

17:12.165 --> 17:13.525
that already had a day pass ready,

17:13.550 --> 17:15.300
and then... And then who sat there

17:15.326 --> 17:16.771
and watched me eat fried food?

17:17.001 --> 17:18.435
And now he's going to the show

17:18.461 --> 17:19.887
and he thinks we're not going.

17:19.912 --> 17:22.012
Oh, we're going to the show.

17:22.239 --> 17:23.792
Yeah, we're going to the show.

17:23.854 --> 17:25.059
Show him.

17:25.084 --> 17:26.084
I can't believe he tried

17:26.108 --> 17:27.750
to tear us apart like that.

17:28.223 --> 17:30.178
I hope he bombs tonight.

17:30.427 --> 17:32.260
I hope someone heckles him.

17:32.990 --> 17:34.850
I hope two people heckle him.

17:35.030 --> 17:36.852
Hmm, interesting.

17:36.969 --> 17:38.569
I'll be Kissinger. You be Nixon.

17:38.635 --> 17:40.569
I'll be SpongeBob. You be Patrick.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.550
[ESTHER] He's Squidward.

17:43.006 --> 17:44.072
[BENJI] Let's go.

17:44.614 --> 17:46.929
Hey, Berkeley, how you doing?

17:46.964 --> 17:48.337
It's so good to see you.

17:48.362 --> 17:51.510
All right, what a nice-looking house.

17:51.535 --> 17:54.269
Now, I gotta tell you
I'm used to, uh, LA houses.

17:54.294 --> 17:55.694
Real sexy, hot houses.

17:55.719 --> 17:58.381
This is not that, but, um,
it's really nice.

17:58.406 --> 18:00.191
This is like a palate cleanser
for my eyes.

18:00.263 --> 18:04.232
Uh, I gotta tell you, uh,
today is my birthday.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.091
- Yeah, happy birthday.
- Yeah.

18:06.116 --> 18:07.559
[BENJI] It's not his birthday.
It's my birthday.

18:07.584 --> 18:09.030
He's stealing it for an easy laugh.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.768
- He's lying.
- Liar.

18:10.793 --> 18:12.574
These are a couple of my friends here.

18:12.599 --> 18:14.420
Uh, these are really nice people.

18:14.445 --> 18:16.266
Thank you so much for showing up.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.963
[LAUGHS] Anyways, guys, uh,

18:19.049 --> 18:21.426
does anybody else think
that when you were a kid

18:21.451 --> 18:24.419
that all dogs were boys
and all cats were girls?

18:24.494 --> 18:26.135
- Right, right, right?
- [CROWD MURMURS]

18:26.160 --> 18:28.925
Well, I did, too,
until I started dating this girl

18:28.973 --> 18:30.963
who had a female dog, and so...

18:30.988 --> 18:34.056
I wonder if this dog joke
ends in "bitch" wordplay?

18:34.164 --> 18:35.965
- I wonder.
- Seriously?

18:36.019 --> 18:37.857
No, I don't wonder.
I can finish this joke for you.

18:37.882 --> 18:39.411
- Most of us can.
- Just let it... you know what?

18:39.436 --> 18:41.756
Let's move on. So anyway, I was
talking to my girlfriend...

18:41.906 --> 18:43.497
- No girlfriend.
- You know what, man?

18:43.593 --> 18:45.127
You know what,
I'm not even gonna give you guys

18:45.171 --> 18:47.439
the-the-the fun of doing this to me.

18:47.464 --> 18:49.531
- I'm out.
- Come back, Jeffrey!

18:49.599 --> 18:51.676
- Come on, oh, dude!
- Jeff, come back.

18:51.742 --> 18:53.775
- He's joking.
- Come on, man.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.755
- We're messing with you.
- Jeffrey!

18:55.881 --> 18:58.314
Best birthday gift ever, heckling Jeff.
Thank you.

18:58.401 --> 19:00.502
I knew you'd love road trips.

19:03.092 --> 19:05.092
So?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.215
I mean, it's the best donut I ever had.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.304
- Gluten-free or not.
- Yes!

19:08.329 --> 19:10.164
- It's the best.
- This completes

19:10.189 --> 19:11.354
the perfect road trip.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.283
Except for when Jeff tried to ruin it,

19:13.325 --> 19:16.359
- but what can you do?
- What? Are you serious?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.189
Come on, this is the same crap
you guys always pull

19:19.214 --> 19:20.453
when you get into a fight
with each other.

19:20.478 --> 19:22.426
Neither one of you wants
to admit that you're wrong,

19:22.451 --> 19:24.589
so you end up dumping it all
on a third party.

19:24.887 --> 19:26.901
Come on, dude, what is this
third party stuff, dude?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.298
Me! I'm the third party.

19:28.323 --> 19:29.556
Me, Jeff.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.526
Unbelievable that you would try

19:31.551 --> 19:33.294
to tear us apart right now.

19:33.335 --> 19:35.402
And on my birthday, dude.
That's so bold.

19:35.477 --> 19:37.851
I don't know about bold,
but it's inconsiderate.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.684
You know what? You know
what, you guys are jerks.

19:40.743 --> 19:42.930
You're terrible.
You're terrible people.

19:43.052 --> 19:45.319
We're just teasing you, relax.

19:45.448 --> 19:48.568
Jeff, come on, we're just heckling you.

19:48.593 --> 19:50.134
Everyone knows it makes you stronger.

19:50.159 --> 19:52.507
- Look how strong we are.
- It's very, very funny

19:52.535 --> 19:54.173
how the two you never want to confront

19:54.198 --> 19:56.235
any of your actual problems
with each other.

19:56.285 --> 19:58.185
Oh, my God, this again
with the problems.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.100
- [JEFF SIGHS]
- Actually, Jeffrey,

20:00.125 --> 20:01.491
we think you're a sociopath.

20:01.817 --> 20:03.784
Well, we don't...
We know you're a sociopath.

20:03.813 --> 20:05.713
Okay, you know what? That's it.

20:05.868 --> 20:07.801
Bye! Bye!

20:08.017 --> 20:09.242
Happy birthday, man.

20:10.846 --> 20:12.146
That was crazy.

20:12.181 --> 20:14.448
Like, straight up, that was so crazy.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.104
I know. He's got problems.

20:16.129 --> 20:18.129
- I feel really bad for him.
- Me too.

20:18.321 --> 20:20.008
And then he's like,
"Confront your problems."

20:20.033 --> 20:21.387
And then we're like, "All
right, here's your problem."

20:21.412 --> 20:23.454
Well, the sad thing is
is that when you act like that

20:23.479 --> 20:25.037
you're never gonna find someone.

20:25.263 --> 20:27.747
You're just always
gonna be by yourself.

20:28.050 --> 20:29.418
Yeah, I know.

20:29.452 --> 20:31.419
It's sad.
