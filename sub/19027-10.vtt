<i>And build a deck on it.</i>

00:18.551 --> 00:20.917
To our half acre.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.545
Hey, look, the Clarks are home.

00:22.655 --> 00:26.284
<i>[J.D.] Unfortunately, the Clarks felt</i>
<i>if we weren't building a house,</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:28.520

00:28.628 --> 00:31.119
- Hey, Clarks!
- Go to hell!

00:31.197 --> 00:35.759
OK. Hey, Buzz! I'm gonna
beat you in poker next time.

- Hi.
- Y'all are a cute couple.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.705

- You want to buy a baby?

00:46.780 --> 00:48.042
- Oh, sweetie?
- No.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.582
- I'm sorry. No, thank you.
- I'll throw in a crib.

<i>disturbs every man on God's Earth.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:28.251
I just got my period.

01:28.321 --> 01:29.481
[All] Oh!

01:29.589 --> 01:32.683
This sucks. I've been trying
to get pregnant for two months.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.785
- I almost bought a baby yesterday.
- What?

01:35.862 --> 01:38.160
<i>[J.D.] Don't tell,</i>

Nothing.

Don't worry about it.
We'll keep trying.

01:42.402 --> 01:46.304
Remember I read how important it is
for the man to have a high-protein diet?

01:46.372 --> 01:49.034
Last time, you are not
eating ribs while we do it.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.475
You don't let me have no fun!

I'm not gonna have a kid until

Wow. Well, you better get cracking.
What are you, like, 45?

Forty-three.
I know I look little older,

but that's 'cause I drink and smoke,

02:16.603 --> 02:19.265

- All right.

It's a basketball thing.
I'm a great rebounder.

You know who else is
a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.

seven Pap smears in one month?

03:03.816 --> 03:07.445

11:44.336 --> 11:47.965
I have it on good authority
that she's a dude.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.940
I made that stuff up.

11:50.009 --> 11:54.742
Then it's time for her to meet
Bob Kelso, licensed hetero.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.719
Sweetie, you're not old.
You don't have crow's feet.

12:00.786 --> 12:04.313
Your bra size hasn't gone
from a 34B to a 40 long.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.153
And you don't have arthritis.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.756
Neither do I, but that's how it gets ya.

12:09.829 --> 12:13.162
<i>[Carla] Then Mrs. Wilk said</i>
<i>something that really surprised me.</i>

12:13.232 --> 12:16.360
It's not like you're trying
to get pregnant and you can't.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.104
Actually, I am.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.230
Oh.

12:25.144 --> 12:29.376
<i>[Carla] None of us were the least bit</i>
<i>surprised that J.D. Made this happen.</i>

12:29.448 --> 12:32.349
Why is Julie behind that bush crying?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.784
Who knows? Could be anything.

12:37.490 --> 12:42.154
You know what's interesting?
She's not saying, "That's so sad."

12:42.228 --> 12:44.196
She's actually crying.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.754
- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.597
<i>[Carla] I tried, but I just couldn't</i>
<i>get babies off my mind.</i>

12:56.709 --> 12:59.473
Excuse me, fellas. Gotta take a whiz.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.513
Wait a minute. Why am I rushing?

13:06.852 --> 13:08.012
All right.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.554
You're disgusting.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.355
She's right. I am disgusting.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.432
I'm disgustingly incapable
of carrying on a relationship

13:20.533 --> 13:22.160
with someone I actually like.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.759
I apologized to her,
so I think we're cool for now,

13:24.837 --> 13:27.772
but it won't last. Every time
she says, "That's so funny,"

13:27.840 --> 13:30.172
it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.

13:30.242 --> 13:33.405
- You're too picky with women.
- You used to be the same way.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.344
You got over it and you're married.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.177
'Cause I was never as bad as you.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.774
Oh, really?
Remember "Whitney the Snapper?"

13:39.852 --> 13:40.910
[Sighs]

13:43.489 --> 13:46.583
Hey. I just wanted
to say thanks for dinner tonight.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.594
And for dessert you're gonna
get a little Whitney...

13:49.662 --> 13:51.027
...à la mode.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.493
Get out.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.327
Too much.

13:57.469 --> 14:01.200
You've been off the pill two months.
Why are you getting a fertility test?

14:01.273 --> 14:04.208
<i>[Carla] Because I'm old</i>
<i>and the crock pot is on the fritz.</i>

14:04.276 --> 14:06.608
- No reason.
- Carla Espinosa?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.772
- Yes.
- Dr. Matthews will see you now.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.748
- Great.
- Oh.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.842
OK, he is super cute.

14:13.919 --> 14:17.286
So do not look into his eyes.
You could get lost.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.483
I'll be fine.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.386
Ask him if he remembers me
from my pelvic exam!

14:25.998 --> 14:27.260
[EIliot] Ask him!

14:31.036 --> 14:33.402
I made popcorn. Ah!

14:34.807 --> 14:36.707
You OK, sweetness?

14:36.775 --> 14:38.743
- I'll go make some more.
- All right.

14:38.844 --> 14:42.007
- Why are we watching a movie?
- It's called immersion therapy.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.275
What we're about to watch
will make her say

14:44.350 --> 14:48.218
"that's so funny" so many times that
eventually it's not gonna bother you.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.517
How can you guarantee
she's gonna laugh?

14:50.589 --> 14:53.615
I can't. But Uncle Buck can.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.658
That's so funny.

14:56.462 --> 15:00.523
That's so funny. Look how big
that pancake is! That's so funny.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.762
[Whispering] Make her stop!

15:03.836 --> 15:06.168
That's so funny!

15:06.238 --> 15:08.172
[Groaning]

15:09.041 --> 15:11.271
<i>[Carla] This guy's not that hot.</i>

15:11.343 --> 15:13.368
You've only been trying
for two months,

15:13.445 --> 15:15.913
so I don't think you need
a fertility test yet.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.915
Unless, of course, you're over 35.

15:17.983 --> 15:21.350
<i>[Carla] Well, buddy,</i>
<i>I'm 36 and OK with it.</i>

15:21.453 --> 15:23.387
So how old are you?

15:24.957 --> 15:27.323
<i>[Carla] Ravish me.</i>

15:27.393 --> 15:29.258
I'm 29.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.091
I've been seeing a lot of 29-year-olds.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.165
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah. Like her.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.234
Call me J.J.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.831
- Immersion therapy didn't work.
- Dude, relax.

15:43.909 --> 15:47.675
I was a psych minor in college. The
next time she says, "That's so funny,"

15:47.780 --> 15:51.147
I want you to pretend she's says,
"That's so money."

15:51.216 --> 15:53.047
Ooh, I like that.

15:53.118 --> 15:57.578
Yeah. It's called
word replacement... ism.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.726
This is the dumbest conversation.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.728
You should hear this one.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.099
I remember my first exam
with Dr. Matthews.

16:08.167 --> 16:12.934
He said, "You're healthy down there."
And then I said, "Right back at you."

16:13.005 --> 16:16.168
And then there was this weird
little awkward pause, so I said,

16:16.275 --> 16:22.111
"I like to keep a clean shop." And then
he asked to see my insurance card.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.649
So, how did your fertility test go?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.776
Everything is A-OK.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.979
[Both] Oh, that's bull!

16:29.054 --> 16:32.148
- Excuse me, sir?
- I was talking to these ladies.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.886
I was talking to you ladies.
Newbie, listen to me.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.588
You never stop being annoyed
by the little things.

16:37.663 --> 16:42.362
Take Gandhi here. Your wife
is the bossiest woman I've ever met.

16:42.434 --> 16:45.403
Are you trying to tell me that
you're not bothered by that?

16:45.504 --> 16:48.996
Sometimes I watch <i>Roots</i>
to remind myself how good I have it.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.234
Me too.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.039
Everyone is annoying.
I mean, take Jordan.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.808
She is just now returning
from what I can only assume

16:55.881 --> 16:58.714
is her eleventh
gynecological visit this month.

16:58.784 --> 17:02.811
I'm saving my breast exam
for when you go away next month.

17:02.888 --> 17:06.153
Upsetting, but we persevere.
Bottom line:

17:06.224 --> 17:09.319
There is no such thing
as a perfect person. You. Tell her.

17:11.597 --> 17:15.363
All right. If you found someone who
makes you happy by just sitting around

17:15.434 --> 17:19.393
and holding hands, then eventually
all that other stuff won't matter.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.836
Mmm.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.238
- Dude, not me.
- I know.

17:23.308 --> 17:27.175
Nurse Espinosa, I know
you didn't take that fertility test.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.612
People think I am
some clueless old geezer,

17:29.715 --> 17:33.242
but nothing that happens
in these hallways gets by me.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.411
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

17:35.487 --> 17:37.216
If I take that fertility test

17:37.289 --> 17:41.225
and I find out that I missed my window
to have a kid I'll never forgive myself.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.193
If you're worried about your legacy,

17:43.262 --> 17:46.527
as the father of a son who not only
wrote a musical based on my life

17:46.598 --> 17:49.761
but is shacked up
with the actor playing me, honestly,

17:49.868 --> 17:53.531
it's not all it's cracked up to be.
But I know you.

17:53.605 --> 17:57.871
You'll find out eventually, so why
don't you just turn around and tell him?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.372
Oh.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.973
Dr. Matthews.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.252
- I'm 36.
- Oh.

18:11.323 --> 18:14.224
Well, let's get you that fertility test.
Follow me.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.590
OK.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.288
<i>[Carla] Here goes nothing.</i>

18:19.398 --> 18:22.265
[J.D. Laughing] One-A-Day Vitamins?

18:22.334 --> 18:25.826
I tell you how they could double
their profits. Two-a-Day Vitamins.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.565
That's so funny.

18:28.707 --> 18:32.234
I'm sorry I said, "That's so funny."
I know that drives you crazy.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.007
You know what?

18:37.349 --> 18:39.317
I really couldn't care less.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.621
So, what do we do now?

18:43.689 --> 18:46.453
I don't know.
We've already got the half acre, right?

18:46.525 --> 18:50.222
I imagine we'll eventually be able
to build a house on it. Backyard.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.560
Room for a Slip 'N Slide for our kids,
Gilligan and the Skipper.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.692
I know. I'm sorry. I gotta do it.
I lost a bet to Turk.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.794
And I don't want to rush things,
but I feel good about this.

18:59.872 --> 19:04.309
I don't know. I feel like...
you and I could go the distance.

19:04.376 --> 19:08.938
Um, actually, I meant what do you want
to order from take-out for dinner.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.379
Oh.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.350
- Tapas.
- I love tapas.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.942
- Sharing.
- Sharing is fun.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.183
- I love it. Just share.
- Share.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.785
So you really don't think
about that kind of stuff?

19:22.861 --> 19:26.695
J.D., I'm only 23. I don't even know
if I want any of that stuff.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.700
And certainly not
for the next five or ten years.

19:29.768 --> 19:30.735
You know what?

19:30.836 --> 19:35.068
We just started dating, so this
conversation goes down a bad road.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.665
Why don't we say we're never
gonna talk about it.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.869
- OK.
- OK.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.505
- [Laughing] OK. Phew.
- OK.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.548
[# Cary Brothers: <i>Ride]</i>

19:45.284 --> 19:47.411
So you really feel that way?

19:49.388 --> 19:50.946
And here I am again.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.583
I can't believe I broke up with her.
Why do I keep doing this?

19:54.660 --> 19:56.628
J.D., this was totally different.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.561
You didn't break up
because she said, "That's so funny"

19:59.631 --> 20:01.861
or she sang Christmas carols
in the summer.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.835
It was August.
The weather was far from frightful.

20:04.903 --> 20:08.771
You broke up with her for a real reason.
Right, Carla?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.865
Definitely.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.309
<i>[Carla] Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what did I just agree to?</i>

20:13.412 --> 20:15.880
<i>All I can think about</i>
<i>is getting my test results.</i>

20:15.948 --> 20:18.974
<i>I have to get out of my head.</i>
<i>Just say something positive.</i>

20:19.051 --> 20:22.384
She's a keeper, J.D.
You'll never do better.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.787
<i>[J.D.] I guess it's human nature</i>
<i>to worry about the future.</i>

20:25.857 --> 20:28.792
<i>Especially when we think</i>
<i>our dreams might not come true.</i>

20:30.596 --> 20:33.690
Thanks. Thanks, Dr. Matthews.
That's great news.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.658
Turk!

20:36.735 --> 20:38.760
- Yeah, baby.
- Get over here.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.102
[Laughing] Yeah!

20:46.478 --> 20:48.639
[Gong crashes]

20:48.747 --> 20:50.840
Yeah, buddy!

20:52.584 --> 20:53.881
<i>[J.D.] As for my future,</i>

20:53.952 --> 20:58.013
<i>I had finally gotten to the place where</i>
<i>I was looking for the right person.</i>

<i>And I knew she was out there.</i>

<i>Even if I couldn't quite see her yet.</i>
