<i>One of the most important
decisions you'll ever make</i>

00:24.482 --> 00:26.192
<i>is who to spend your life with.</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:29.654
<i>Who they are.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:33.491
<i>Who you are when you're with them.</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.997
<i>And if that's the person
you really wanna be.</i>

00:38.997 --> 00:42.417
<i>♪ Pain in my chest, pain in my breast
Yeah, you were the key ♪</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.335
<i>♪ And you know ♪</i>

00:44.335 --> 00:46.588
<i>♪ You know I hate to fight ♪</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:51.092
<i>♪ You know, you know I can't believe... ♪</i>

00:51.092 --> 00:52.510
Now fuck me.

00:56.055 --> 00:59.184
<i>Fairy tales absolutely do come true.</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:05.482
<i>But sometimes you have to
go through hell first to get there.</i>

01:06.274 --> 01:08.068
Hold on. Wait.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.819
- Oh, come on.
- Don't! Just--

01:10.528 --> 01:11.613
Just don't.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.121
I came to you six months ago with a ring,

01:20.121 --> 01:22.207
with a dream of a life,

01:22.207 --> 01:23.625
and you said no.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.585
- I know.
- No, you don't.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.673
It took everything I have to get over you.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.092
I had to--

01:34.010 --> 01:36.221
I had to bury all those feelings...

01:37.305 --> 01:38.723
just to stay alive.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.935
And now...

01:45.188 --> 01:46.231
it's too late.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.279
I met someone.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.073
Gigi.

01:55.073 --> 01:55.990
She's...

01:57.826 --> 01:59.452
- She's a model.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.122
Of course she is.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.414
And she's pregnant.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.877
We're gonna start a family together.

02:09.129 --> 02:09.963
I can...

02:11.047 --> 02:13.758
finally make things right.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.971
Be the man you always wanted me to be.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.891
Just with someone else.

02:21.891 --> 02:22.809
Hey.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.310
Oh, my God.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.438
This is so embarrassing. Wow.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.024
I never should've come. Um--

02:30.024 --> 02:33.444
I just-- I've been trying
to forget about you and this...

02:34.654 --> 02:37.824
part of me for months now, you know?

02:37.824 --> 02:42.162
And then I saw you
at Sasha's book event and I--

02:42.162 --> 02:43.621
What event?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.249
This afternoon, at the pavilion.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.877
No, I wasn't there, Billie.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.962
Yes, you were.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.130
I saw you.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.052
Oh, my God.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.348
What about Cooper?

03:03.391 --> 03:04.392
Huh?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.644
What was your plan?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.688
Were you just gonna hide this from him?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.189
I don't know.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.485
I guess so.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.279
That's not who you are.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.698
Or who you wanna be.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.953
Forget me, all right?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.373
Forget us.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.169
You have a choice you need to make.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.379
No, I should just go home

03:33.379 --> 03:37.133
and, like, pretend
like none of this ever happened.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.176
Or not.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.931
You are fearless, Billie Mann.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.309
You need to remember that.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.940
And decide what you really want
out of your life.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.108
<i>Billie?</i>

03:55.151 --> 03:56.152
<i>Billie?</i>

03:58.112 --> 03:59.030
Billie?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.076
Come on, girl.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.247
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You're back!

04:07.247 --> 04:08.373
Of course!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.500
- And I'm exhausted.
- Oh.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.920
But I brought reinforcements.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.879
Yeah.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.840
And you got a couch.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.885
I finally unpacked all those boxes,

04:20.885 --> 04:23.513
which means this is really happening.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.099
This is my life now.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.435
For the three days a week
you're not in Connecticut with your kids.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.812
- Thanks.
- Hey.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.023
Some time to yourself
is one of the perks of divorce.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.735
Or so says the DILF
I shacked up with in San Fran.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.071
You gotta do a book tour.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.574
A paramour in every city doesn't suck.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.868
I need to write a book first.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.579
Well, now you have time.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.708
Look, we need to get you
out of this apartment

04:51.708 --> 04:53.751
and back in the game.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.795
Mm? Mm?

04:55.795 --> 04:56.713
- Okay.

04:57.755 --> 04:58.589
Oh, my God.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.258
Get your ass in here.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.221
These clothes are crusty, girl.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.098
Haven't really been going out.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.599
No shit.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.184
It's been months.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.603
You need to stop punishing yourself.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.188
Put on some real clothes.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.898
Maybe a little lip gloss.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.067
Come find our new neighborhood joint.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.485
I don't know, Sash.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.945
Well, I do.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.197
Plus, I got news.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.450
Guess whose bestselling best friend

05:25.450 --> 05:29.787
is going to be interviewed
live on national TV tomorrow

05:29.787 --> 05:32.248
by mother-loving Soledad O'Brien?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.791
- No.
- Yes!

05:34.500 --> 05:35.376
What?

05:40.048 --> 05:41.591
Cheers, honey.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.843
Yes.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.017
No. What is that? Your phantom diamond?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.562
You miss the noose-like golden handcuff
that thing had become?

05:54.562 --> 05:56.064
It's just weird.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.191
It's not weird.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.526
It's just like old times.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.446
We are the hottest women in this place

06:03.446 --> 06:06.741
and plenty of dudes
are rightfully checking us out.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.285
- Like him.
-  Oh.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.745
-  And him.
-  Stop it.

06:10.745 --> 06:14.040
- And him, and him, and him.
- Enough. Put your-- Stop!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.833
I will not.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.462
Because you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.798
Oh. Well, in that case,

06:21.798 --> 06:23.800
let me just go get my fuck on right now.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.926
- Whoa!
- Oh!

06:24.926 --> 06:26.052
- Oh, my--
- Easy, killer.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.637
I'm so sorry.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.764
Oh, my God. Here. No, I got it.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.808
Ow!

06:31.808 --> 06:33.017
Oh, my God.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.310
Are you okay?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.813
Perfect, yeah.
I was ready for a new nose anyway.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.689
Do you think it's broken?

06:40.775 --> 06:41.943
I don't know.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.569
Maybe you could check it out?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.570
What do you think?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.906
I think you're gonna be fine.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.868
Maybe I could get
your insurance information just in case?

06:50.868 --> 06:54.831
I got a pretty high deductible.
Might be better to just self-pay.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.752
Anyway, have a great night.
I'm really sorry about that.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.129
Whoa, whoa. What's your name?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.133
I never come this far uptown,

07:05.133 --> 07:09.512
but my buddy's playing around the corner
at The Beacon so we stopped in.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.389
Now I think I know why.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.683
Oh, my God. Why?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.101
Because it's kismet?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.520
Let me buy you a drink. Find out.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.397
Okay. Well...

07:19.397 --> 07:22.275
I already have a drink so--

07:22.275 --> 07:23.776
Actually...

07:25.862 --> 07:28.114
Hmm. Problem solved.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.033
Her name's Billie, by the way.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.745
Nice to meet you, Billie.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.165
Nice to meet you...

07:37.748 --> 07:38.833
Majid.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.210
- Majid.
- It's Persian.

07:42.044 --> 07:42.920
And you?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.589
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.506
Half.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.424
My dad.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.845
Listen, I'm flattered.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.931
Though clearly not a big believer in fate.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.434
I'm just out
having a drink with my friend.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.060
I'm not really--

07:58.060 --> 07:59.187
Available?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.482
I figured you were too hot to be single.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.235
So who's the lucky guy?

08:12.950 --> 08:13.784
You're back.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.414
You're still awake.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.460
Good.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.213
We need to talk.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.301
I know I said that everything was fine...

08:31.594 --> 08:34.764
and I was hoping it would be fine,
but the truth is...

08:37.725 --> 08:38.976
it's not.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.897
Is this your way of explaining
where you've been all night?

08:44.649 --> 08:45.816
I went to see Brad.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
Yeah, no shit.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.242
Put a tracker on your phone, Billie.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.662
You did what?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.082
I knew you'd go back to him.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.959
This isn't about Brad.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.210
This is about me.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.462
It's about us. It's about our marriage.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.839
Which is pretty much over,
don't you think?

09:08.839 --> 09:10.591
I think we need to find out.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.634
Oh, please.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.054
I should have left you six months ago
and I was about to,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.306
but your fucking boyfriend
convinced me to stay,

09:17.306 --> 09:20.643
telling me that I was the one you wanted,
which is clearly not true.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.354
I wanted it to be true.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.315
But the only reason it's been working
at all the last six months

09:26.315 --> 09:30.820
is because I took the blame for everything
right up until what happened with Trina.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.197
Cooper, I wanna be honest...

09:33.781 --> 09:37.159
with myself and you
about who I am and what I want.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.954
And I want us to be able
to talk through it.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.914
We should go to counseling.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.374
Fuck counseling.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.834
And fuck you.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
Okay. Cooper.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.214
Cooper, you don't mean that, okay?
I know you're upset--

09:50.214 --> 09:51.382
I'm not.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.300
I--

09:53.718 --> 09:55.094
I'm just done.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.771
There's no guy.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.814
Lucky or otherwise.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.691
Then lucky me.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.609
No.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.821
Okay, you know what?

10:15.740 --> 10:16.699
Screw it.

10:18.075 --> 10:21.078
You don't wanna go out with me, okay?

10:21.078 --> 10:24.290
I am a messy mess right now

10:24.290 --> 10:25.708
who just blew up her life.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.460
I mean, kind of unintentionally,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.921
but if I'm really being honest,
completely intentionally.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.758
I have two young kids.
I'm in the middle of a bitter divorce.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.800
But even worse,

10:34.800 --> 10:38.095
I'm pining away for the love of my life,
who is with somebody else now,

10:38.095 --> 10:39.722
a fucking model,

10:39.722 --> 10:41.015
and they're having a baby,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.893
so I'm supposed to figure out
how to move on without him,

10:43.893 --> 10:48.356
but the only problem is
I'm pretty sure I never, ever will.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.692
You're something else.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.778
- So I've been told.
- No.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.446
I like it.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.823
Usually, you have to put in three dates

10:57.823 --> 11:00.701
before you get to
what's really going on with someone.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.829
Is that the new three date rule?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.539
At this point in my life...

11:05.539 --> 11:08.000
it feels so much better
to just skip the dance.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.460
Cut to the chase.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.171
Not that I don't like to dance.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.133
I'm very much looking forward
to doing the dance with you, Billie.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.093
Okay.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.761
You're insane. You realize that?

11:18.761 --> 11:23.140
Well, not everything
has to make sense to make sense.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.353
Besides, the time
right after you blow up your life...

11:28.521 --> 11:30.398
it's usually the most exciting.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.399
Trust me.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.151
What does that mean?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.486
Just that...

11:36.487 --> 11:39.073
what seems like it was
the worst day of your life...

11:39.740 --> 11:41.826
might actually have been the best.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.245
Okay.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.707
Thank you,
but I am a PhD candidate in psychology

11:48.707 --> 11:53.337
which means I am drowning in aphorisms
about how crises build resilience.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.966
Uh, "The future lies in you."
"Make your own tomorrow."

11:56.966 --> 11:58.884
I mean, it's all I think about.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.302
Maybe that's your problem.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.263
Too much thinking.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.516
Give me your phone.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.101
Excuse me?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.353
It's how the kids do it these days.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.605
Tomorrow night.

12:12.982 --> 12:13.899
Eight o'clock.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.193
I know a great place in the Village.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.570
Let me take you out.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.738
Get your mind on something else.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.157
Okay?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.074
Dude.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.326
We're good to go.

12:25.911 --> 12:26.745
Kismet.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.622
Yeah.

12:34.503 --> 12:38.674
Now that's what I'm talking about! Ow!

12:38.674 --> 12:40.801
I'm going out!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.762
Let's go, baby!

12:47.892 --> 12:48.767
Daddy?

12:49.435 --> 12:50.853
What's up, bud?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.771
Olga needs you downstairs.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.732
All right. I'm coming.

13:06.160 --> 13:06.994
You all right?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.622
How long is Olga gonna be staying with us?

13:11.707 --> 13:12.875
For a while.

13:14.543 --> 13:18.589
- She's really helping, don't you think?
- I want Mommy to come home.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.300
She'll be here tomorrow.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.887
We're taking turns now, remember?

13:24.887 --> 13:28.307
I want us to be home together
like a family.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.813
I know you do, bud.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.653
Hey, Olga. What's going on?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.737
This.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.323
Ellary!

13:44.323 --> 13:46.242
Oh, my God. Come here, baby.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.744
Come to Daddy, Els. Come to Daddy.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.372
Come here. Look at you go! Aw!

13:51.372 --> 13:52.623
Come here.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.751
Come here! Aw!

13:57.419 --> 13:59.588
Oh! You did so good!

13:59.588 --> 14:00.839
Look at you.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.716
I'll send Billie the video.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.097
Great.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.434
<i>Look, marriage isn't for everyone.</i>

14:12.434 --> 14:15.145
What's important
is that we question everything.

14:15.145 --> 14:19.358
Test our assumptions and the institutions
which have grown from them.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.611
Hmm. Would you ever
consider marriage yourself?

14:22.611 --> 14:23.862
Hmm...

14:23.862 --> 14:26.866
I recently received a proposal actually,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.325
but turned it down.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.744
Marriage just isn't
the right paradigm for me.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.540
So your book
is not exactly a how-to guide.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.208
Far from it.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.169
My idea of having it all
means doing what I want, when I want,

14:39.169 --> 14:41.046
with whomever I want.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.841
Hmm. An independent woman.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.884
For life.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.926
Sasha Snow.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.303
<i>The Third Way.</i>

14:47.303 --> 14:50.139
Get it, read it, live it.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.726
This is the new world order, ladies,
and I like it.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.686
We'll be right back.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.439
<i>And we're out.
Back in three with the weather.</i>

14:58.439 --> 15:00.566
- What a pleasure.
- I'm such a huge fan.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734
Thank you.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.532
It was better
than I ever could've imagined.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.450
Right?

15:10.075 --> 15:12.745
- I am completely out of my body right now.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.331
My God, Sash.

You did it.
Everything we talked about in college,

16:07.383 --> 16:09.426
everything we dreamt about.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.761

16:10.761 --> 16:13.806

Hi, Kam.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.737
Oh. Hey. Here.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.241
You carry a handkerchief.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.450
Seriously?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.744
Something I picked up in the outback.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.247
Never know when
you're gonna need a tourniquet.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.624
What are you doing here?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.544
I am getting interviewed too.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.380
Raising awareness for
our disaster relief efforts in the Congo.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.881
You're kidding.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.300
No, I left the Cleveland Clinic.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.721
Now I run
an international medical non-profit.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.890
I guess my bleeding heart
got the better of me.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.935
I didn't know you were in Cleveland.

16:59.935 --> 17:03.230
Well, what's it been? 17 years?

17:04.314 --> 17:07.109
Hey, let me take you to dinner.
I'll tell you all about it.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.318
Are you serious?

17:08.318 --> 17:09.403
Come on.

17:09.403 --> 17:13.907
I know you're not married. You just told
all of America you turned down a proposal?

17:13.907 --> 17:17.494
Did some guy come and snatch you up
between then and now?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.704
Not exactly.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.830
Excellent.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.083
Dr. Evans, we're ready for you.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.084
Thank you.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.795
I'll send you a car.

17:27.629 --> 17:28.714
Mm-hm.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.760
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.886
I'm breathing.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.138
Now this is kismet.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.432
He's back and clearly still into you

17:38.432 --> 17:42.686
and you are at a completely different
place in your life, so this is perfect.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.564
Maybe this is how it was meant to be.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.115
Cooper.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.541
Francesca.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.503
Good morning.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.129

Hey, guys.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.138
New coffee bar on 22.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.140
Worth the trip.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.683
Can't wait to try it.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.230
Holy fuck sticks!

19:50.230 --> 19:53.233
It has been a long time
since I saw a 9 a.m. ass grab.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.985
- You did it, didn't you?
- Dev.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.278
Yes, you did.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.237
I fucking knew it.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.199
I knew something was going on.
There were no weepy phone calls,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.409
no desperate nights crying into your beer.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.454
I figured you had to be fucking somebody.
I was hoping it was her.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.331
Aw, that's so romantic.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.001
Just tell me,
is it as hot and horny as I imagined?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.297
It's better.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.548
Oh, my God.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.843
You and that naughty little
<i>Wharton</i> centerfold?

20:19.843 --> 20:20.886
Okay. All right.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.805
No, dude, I am so damn jealous.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.600
Are you guys just fucking like bunnies
all over this place?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.727
- No, absolutely not.
- Why not?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.729
What is the point of nailing your coworker

20:30.729 --> 20:33.941
if you're not going to indulge
in illicit office sex?

20:33.941 --> 20:37.319
Yeah, except Francesca is not my coworker.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.362
She's my boss.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.113
That's what makes it so hot.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.825
Dev, seriously,
you need to keep your mouth shut.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.119
You know the year
I've had in this place with HR.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.329
You cannot say anything.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.501
Don't worry. I'm on your side.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.046
By the way, I fucking love Cooper 2.0.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.009
<i>Is there such a thing as one true love?</i>

21:02.177 --> 21:03.470
Are soulmates real?

21:05.597 --> 21:09.017
The ancient Greeks believed that we were,
once upon a time,

21:09.017 --> 21:11.270
physically ripped from one another,

21:11.270 --> 21:14.439
doomed eternally
to search for our other half.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.985
So the search for love

21:17.985 --> 21:22.698
is thus an attempt
to heal the wound of human nature.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.200
And yet...

21:25.993 --> 21:29.162
eternal doom isn't exactly
a great way to go through life.

21:30.163 --> 21:36.420
So, what if there are instead many mates
for the many different versions of you?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.088
And if one, or...

21:40.215 --> 21:41.466
even two...

21:42.801 --> 21:44.219
are lost to the wind...

21:47.389 --> 21:49.308
it only makes room for the next.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.320
Hey.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.572
Sorry about earlier. Um...

22:05.282 --> 22:07.826
Devon swears he's gonna
keep his mouth shut.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.119
So...

22:10.287 --> 22:11.830
we're trusting Devon now.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.874
I know.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.296
Ugh. I gotta get ahold of myself.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.466
Don't you dare.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.095
I am just so turned on by you.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.557
The last six months,

22:30.557 --> 22:33.894
have been the best time of my life.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.688
Don't, don't, don't.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.817
If I so much as catch a whiff of you,
I'm done.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.695
Call Olga.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.074
Tell her you'll be late
and then come to my place.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.618
I can't. I gotta go home and see my kids,

22:49.618 --> 22:52.829
and then I will be back
in your bed in 24 hours.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.916
- I don't know if I can wait that long.
- You have to.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.711
We have to be good.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.091
<i>♪ Forget about us ♪</i>

23:06.676 --> 23:09.805
<i>♪ Alone on the mountain ♪</i>

23:10.931 --> 23:12.057
Oh, God.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.059
- What happened to you?
-  I don't know.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.852
Marriage. The burbs.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.479
Okay, you tell me.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.356
What is the appropriate outfit

23:19.356 --> 23:22.984
for a divorced mother of two
going on a date in New York City

23:22.984 --> 23:24.986
for the first time in ten years?

23:24.986 --> 23:27.531
Do I wear this?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.032
Absolutely not.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.576
We'd have to at least do
a whole sage ceremony first.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.619
Oh.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.620
Come with me.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.919
Um, what's all this?

23:40.919 --> 23:43.755
I thought you were wearing
the Balmain you got at Bergdorf's?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.049
I wanted options.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.926
Because it's fun?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.846
Because I'm freaking out
about going to dinner

23:50.846 --> 23:52.973
with the ex love of my life, okay?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.518
Honey.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.896
You don't have to go.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.482
Please.

24:02.482 --> 24:06.486
If Brad magically appeared after 17 years
and said he wanted to take you to dinner

24:06.486 --> 24:08.905
sans baby mama, would you go?

24:13.076 --> 24:14.035
Look at us.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.833
You told me to step out
of my comfort zone and I am,

24:19.833 --> 24:20.917
but so are you.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.964
Going out with a guy
who actually means something to you, huh?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.550
Huh? Come on.

24:33.763 --> 24:34.848
Oh, shit.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.851
Um... You know what? Here.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.938
Where are the pants?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.274
Alex.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.317
Hi.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.152
Congrats on Soledad.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.196
Thanks for not mentioning me by name.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.907
Sorry about that.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.533
I should've given you a heads-up.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.618
<i>It's okay.</i>

24:54.618 --> 24:56.661
That's what I get
for proposing to a writer.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.372
- Everything is copy, right?
- That's not all it was.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.707
<i>Damn straight.</i>

25:00.707 --> 25:03.043
<i>It was also the best sex of your life.</i>

25:04.961 --> 25:08.423
Okay, fine.
It was the best sex of my life.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.894
<i>Just because you don't wanna get married
doesn't mean we can't still hang out.</i>

25:24.731 --> 25:26.066
<i>Sash?</i>

25:26.066 --> 25:28.610
Um, I'm sorry. I have to go.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.736
<i>Of course you do.</i>

25:29.736 --> 25:31.696
Just remember, my offer still stands.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.242
How's this?

25:37.452 --> 25:38.787
Oh!

25:39.496 --> 25:41.081
Perfect.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.335
You are gonna have a great night.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.711
So are you.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.756
Where's my babies?

25:49.756 --> 25:51.049
Welcome home, Daddy.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.300
Thank you, buddy.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.469
How was your day?

25:54.469 --> 25:56.388
I took Ellary on a hike.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.305
Really?

25:57.305 --> 26:01.184
He set up chairs in the backyard
so she could make a loop.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.648
Oh, hey. Who's that?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.191
Uncle Spence.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.486
Uncle Spence. What's going on?

26:11.486 --> 26:13.655
You tell me.
I just got off the phone with Mom.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.366
Her and Dad had no idea
that you and Billie separated,

26:16.366 --> 26:18.576
<i>let alone I'm acting
as your divorce attorney.</i>

26:18.576 --> 26:19.619
Just one sec.

26:19.619 --> 26:22.664
Why are you hiding this
like some naughty child?

26:22.664 --> 26:26.167
Please, the last thing I need is
Mom and Dad telling me what a shame it is,

26:26.167 --> 26:29.296
how they never thought that I'd be
the one with the failed marriage.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.923
- They're worried about you.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:34.509
- I've got a lot going on right now.
<i>- Clearly.</i>

26:34.509 --> 26:38.179
Considering we gave the court my address
as your part-time, temporary residence,

26:38.179 --> 26:41.308
but you haven't spent the night there
in weeks. Where have you been?

26:41.308 --> 26:44.978
Honestly, having the hottest sex
of my life with Francesca.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.438
Oh, wow.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.940
Well, that sounds healthy.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.317
Isn't she your boss?

26:50.317 --> 26:51.735
<i>So the fuck what?</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:54.738
<i>She's also the woman
that's appreciated me since day one</i>

26:54.738 --> 26:57.115
and who'd been warning me
about Billie for months.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.742
Okay, okay. Hold on.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.036
I know we're all supposed
to be hating on Billie,

27:01.036 --> 27:04.039
but she is the mother of your children,
and she will be for life,

27:04.039 --> 27:06.583
and you need to deal with that
one way or the other.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.793
<i>Hopefully, that doesn't
turn you into an asshole</i>

27:08.793 --> 27:11.087
with a giant chip on your shoulder
and hate in your heart,

27:11.087 --> 27:14.591
because trust me, I was that guy.
That is not you.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.177
Hey, you okay?

27:20.096 --> 27:23.016
<i>Maybe I am that guy now. Maybe I changed.</i>

27:23.016 --> 27:24.434
Maybe I smartened up.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.979
<i>You've always been the knight
in shining armor ever since we were kids.</i>

27:29.189 --> 27:32.817
<i>Do you remember senior year
when I snuck into the city</i>

27:32.817 --> 27:34.361
to go to my first gay club?

27:34.361 --> 27:35.904
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

27:35.904 --> 27:39.824
I got so drunk flirting with that kid
who said he was in the Blue Man Group

27:39.824 --> 27:43.828
that I ended up
in the East Village at 3 a.m.,

27:43.828 --> 27:48.333
with no shirt, shoes, wallet,
just a bunch of blue handprints on my ass.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.667
That's a classic.

27:50.293 --> 27:53.088
<i>And who showed up?
Dependable, sober, gave me a ride home.</i>

27:53.088 --> 27:55.924
Even proofread my capstone paper for me.

27:56.549 --> 27:57.467
I did.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.220
<i>So go on, shack up with your hottie boss
all you want.</i>

28:00.220 --> 28:02.722
<i>I've seen worse post-divorce
freak-outs before, but...</i>

28:04.349 --> 28:07.143
someday, I hope you remember
who you really are.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.772
A nice guy.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.524
<i>It's not a bad thing.</i>

28:13.274 --> 28:14.901
It's what I love most about you.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.906
- I'll talk to you later.
<i>- Coop--</i>

28:36.423 --> 28:37.382
Hi.

28:40.468 --> 28:41.428
You made it.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.265
I wasn't 100% sure you would show.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.518
Well, you put a reminder alarm
on my phone, so...

28:48.518 --> 28:51.271
- Did I? That was smart.
- Mm.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.858
I thought we could sit
at the chef's counter,

28:54.858 --> 28:57.861
- get a sense how this place tastes.
- Yeah, sure. Great.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.862
Come with me.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.240
Um, shouldn't we check in
with the hostess first?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.367
You're acting like you own the place.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.912
Uh, well, I don't own all of it.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.330
At least not yet.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.999
I have investors, but...

29:12.667 --> 29:17.547
yeah, this is mine.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.218
This is what I blew up my life to come do.

29:24.137 --> 29:24.971
Come on.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.407
<i>Bellissima.</i>

29:46.159 --> 29:48.536
What is going on?

29:49.412 --> 29:50.747
I thought you said dinner.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.707
Oh, there will be food.

29:53.416 --> 29:57.128
Seriously, what are we doing here?

30:00.256 --> 30:01.633
This is our place.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.092
I know.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.888
Okay, fine.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.726
I wanted to do
something special to celebrate,

30:12.519 --> 30:17.524
because I didn't just run into you
this morning by chance.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.735
I was given a choice of dates,

30:20.735 --> 30:23.863
and when I saw your name on the list,
I knew I had to go today,

30:23.863 --> 30:27.158
just to see your face,
even if you were married,

30:27.158 --> 30:32.205
even if it was nothing more
than a catch up between old friends.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.251
We were never just friends.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.214
You wanna come inside and have a look?

30:57.939 --> 31:00.275
Oh, my God. I can't.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.818
But, yes, bring it on.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.862
Bring me everything.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.948
I think this is actually
one of everything on our menu.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.076
Mm. You did the ordering, not me.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.705
Oh.

31:14.622 --> 31:15.915
I like that you like to eat.

31:15.915 --> 31:19.043
Well, I like that your food
is so damn good.

31:20.128 --> 31:23.089
- Are all of these recipes yours?
- Oh, yeah. Well...

31:24.215 --> 31:26.384
some of them were borrowed from my mom.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.927
She must be so proud.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.679
I think she's getting there.

31:31.347 --> 31:35.685
But no one was happy
when I moved to New York.

31:38.521 --> 31:40.273
I used to be in finance.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.358
In Doha.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.735
You're kidding me.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.529
I did everything
the way I was supposed to.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.825
I had everything I was supposed to want.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.327
Except?

31:55.079 --> 31:58.166
Nothing felt... right.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.336
'Cause way down deep,

32:01.336 --> 32:06.174
there was this itch for something more

32:06.174 --> 32:10.511
and a sinking feeling that if I didn't
put aside all the supposed-to's

32:10.511 --> 32:13.890
and at least try to go for it, for this...

32:15.475 --> 32:18.353
dream I've had since I was a little boy,

32:20.063 --> 32:22.023
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.984
That's really brave.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.154
I need you to talk to my mom.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.198
I'm not sure she saw it that way.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.953
I had just enough money for a food truck
when I got here.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.498
- I started at the Brooklyn Flea.
- I love that place.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.834
I slept in that truck for months.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.172
But now, six years later...

32:49.384 --> 32:52.470
turns out, that itch was right.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.808
That itch...

32:58.309 --> 33:00.770
has gotten me into trouble my whole life.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.188
That's good trouble.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.483
Appetite, desire,

33:06.275 --> 33:08.778
those are the things
that tell you you're still alive.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.322
Otherwise, what's the point?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.428
So you wanna tell me
how you pulled this off?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.304
Well, I have my ways.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.849
Running an NGO
with a board full of New York's richest

33:37.849 --> 33:40.226
and most powerful has its perks.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.144
Ah.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.855
You still a Goya fan?

33:43.855 --> 33:47.734
Well, the <i>Nude Maja</i> always have
a very special place in my heart.

33:48.401 --> 33:52.030
- No, I'm actually into abstract art now.
- Oh.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.657
I've learned that life
isn't always so straight ahead.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.869
You think things are going one way,
and then...

33:59.454 --> 34:03.416
Something happens,
which turns everything upside down.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.215
Come here.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.517
Oh, my God. Kam...

34:23.144 --> 34:24.437
what did you do?

34:26.522 --> 34:28.566
I'm just saying,
there's a hidden narrative

34:28.566 --> 34:32.320
about existential freedom
that was absolutely intentional.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.199
What, you don't buy it?

34:38.284 --> 34:40.870
- I have something to tell you.
- Okay.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.250
I got into Stanford Med School.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.087
What are you talking about?

34:49.087 --> 34:52.298
We made a list of where we were applying
so we could stay together,

34:52.298 --> 34:56.177
- and Stanford was not on it.
- I know, I know. It was a wild shot.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.971
I didn't tell you
because I didn't think I'd get in.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.056
But now...

35:01.182 --> 35:02.183
You wanna go.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.560
It's Stanford.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.276
I am gonna miss you so much.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.362
You don't have to.

35:15.905 --> 35:16.948
Come with me.

35:16.948 --> 35:21.661
Kam, I didn't even apply to any
grad programs anywhere in California.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.122
- What am I gonna do out there?
- You surf.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.999
Lay on the beach, drink great wine.

35:26.999 --> 35:30.211
But that's not what I want.
That's not who I am.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.506
You really think I'd be happy
just watching you go off

35:33.506 --> 35:35.842
and start your career
while mine dies on the vine.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.844
We'll check out schools
when you get there.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.264
You can enroll in spring semester
or take the year.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.849
But I'm already behind,

35:42.849 --> 35:46.352
because I took a semester off
to follow you to Rome.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.064
It was Rome,

35:50.064 --> 35:52.567
and this is California.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.903
This is what our life is, baby,
grand adventures.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.780
I just want us to take them together.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.616
I do too, but...

36:01.659 --> 36:02.952
You know what?

36:04.370 --> 36:05.204
Come on.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.499
Let's take the biggest adventure of all.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.548
Kam, what are you doing?

36:15.548 --> 36:18.134
What I should have done
that night in Rome.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.978
Marry me, Sasha Snow.

36:30.438 --> 36:34.358
I will give you a life bigger
and better than you ever dreamed.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.862
When I'm through this program,
we can go anywhere you want.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.532
I just-- I don't wanna
wake up a single morning

36:41.532 --> 36:44.660
without you in my arms.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.920
Okay, fine.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.379
Is that a yes?

36:55.379 --> 36:58.049
- Are you gonna be my wife, Sasha Snow?
- Yes!

36:58.049 --> 37:00.218
- Yes?
- Yes, yes.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.386
-  Yes? Oh, my God.
-  Yes.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.981
It's been 17 years,

37:13.981 --> 37:17.401
and I have never stopped
thinking about that moment.

37:18.444 --> 37:21.113
I know things went sideways,
but none of that matters now.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.073
Stop, stop.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.200
This is--

37:25.618 --> 37:26.452
I--

37:28.663 --> 37:29.789
I need a second.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.877
- Sasha, wait.
- No, you wait.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.630
For once.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.441
Sash?

37:59.193 --> 38:00.111
Gran?

38:00.945 --> 38:01.904
Hey.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.115
What are you doing?

38:05.574 --> 38:07.368
More like what are you doing?

38:07.994 --> 38:10.746
Packing to move to Cali
with my hot fiancé.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.874
Just giving it all up for some man?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.502
Gran, it is one semester.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.338
It already was one semester.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.590
Now it's a year, at least.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.552
You are slipping away from yourself.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.387
That's not what this is.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.681
I know guys like Kam.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.725
All too well.

38:30.725 --> 38:34.979
How easy it is
to get swept up into his dreams.

38:34.979 --> 38:38.065
Sooner or later,
you got to stand up for what you want.

38:38.065 --> 38:41.110
- This is what I want.
- It's not all you want.

38:41.110 --> 38:44.196
I will come back to that later. My work--

38:44.196 --> 38:47.533
That's what everybody says
when they make this choice,

38:47.533 --> 38:52.288
but trust me, a lot of women,
just as smart as you, never do.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.581
Well, I'm not you.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.417
I know what I'm doing.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.212
Then why didn't you open the letter?

39:01.547 --> 39:02.673
From Columbia?

39:02.673 --> 39:06.927
The grad program
that actually is your dream?

39:06.927 --> 39:10.097
Maybe because you were too scared.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.724
Thought you might be tempted,

39:11.724 --> 39:15.394
didn't wanna have a Plan B
you might actually want to take.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.104
That is not the reason.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.147
Then open it.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.648
Fine.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.585
I got in. Okay?

39:40.878 --> 39:42.380
But this changes nothing.

39:44.757 --> 39:50.262
And that alone
should be enough to scare you.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.025
Kam?

40:04.026 --> 40:06.237
- Listen.
- I'm sorry.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.322
I know this is a lot.

40:08.322 --> 40:11.367
I don't know what went wrong before.

40:11.367 --> 40:15.579
Clearly, you didn't feel
as much as I did, but--

40:15.579 --> 40:16.831
Bullshit!

40:17.748 --> 40:19.583
That was never the problem.

40:19.583 --> 40:23.629
It wasn't that I didn't feel enough.
It's that I felt too much.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.756
What are you talking about?

40:27.007 --> 40:29.593
You can't just bring me here,
to this place,

40:29.593 --> 40:32.972
and expect me to drop everything again.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.850
- Wait, Sasha, please.
- No.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.144
This is what you do, Kam.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.521
You go from zero to 60 in a second,

40:40.521 --> 40:43.274
and sweep everything along in your path.

40:45.651 --> 40:48.821
But I will not lose myself again.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.038
You didn't have to bring me
all the way back uptown.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.792
I know the cool kids
never cross 14th Street.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.961
Well, I'm not that cool.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.505
Besides, I've had
good luck in these parts.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.423
Oh, yeah?

41:07.423 --> 41:11.010
Well, thank you for an amazing evening,

41:11.677 --> 41:13.137
one I honestly...

41:15.514 --> 41:17.391
I didn't know if I'd ever have again.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.685
This is just the beginning.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.313
Promise.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.326
I'm sorry.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.748
I have to take it slow.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.125
- This is all--
- Don't worry.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.170
We got time.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.674
Plus, I just pictured
the whole thing in my mind,

41:50.674 --> 41:54.386
and it was... incredible.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.396
- I'm gonna go back to work.
- Okay.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.359
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, you too.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.530
Oh, my God.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.991
What happened?

42:59.577 --> 43:00.911
Gran's right.

43:02.621 --> 43:06.542
I can't do this. I can't just throw
everything away for some guy.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.045
- Well, what did Kam say?
- Nothing.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.840
I didn't tell him.

43:13.424 --> 43:14.925
I couldn't. I just...

43:16.719 --> 43:19.305
turned around at the airport
and walked out.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.599
So he doesn't even know?

43:33.527 --> 43:35.070
Sash, answer it.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.823
Tell him what's going on.

43:37.823 --> 43:38.991
I can't.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.911
If I do, I won't stay strong.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.248
I'll be on the next flight out. I know it.

43:50.794 --> 43:51.712
Bills.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.484
Hey, how's it going?

44:14.485 --> 44:17.029
I screwed up big time.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.238
Already?

44:18.238 --> 44:20.324
<i>Mm. Ha.</i>

44:20.324 --> 44:25.954
Um, well, it turns out
that Majid's awesome.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.667
And he's just like me in so many ways.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.212
And what are the odds,
you know, of finding somebody

44:33.212 --> 44:36.256
who's okay with all my baggage,

44:36.256 --> 44:37.591
plus, smoking hot?

44:37.591 --> 44:39.677
So, what did you do?

44:39.677 --> 44:41.053
<i>I chickened out.</i>

44:41.053 --> 44:43.013
At the last second, he was...

44:44.139 --> 44:46.475
trying to kiss me, and--

44:46.475 --> 44:47.768
Oh, girl...

44:49.728 --> 44:52.356
go back and kiss that man.

44:52.356 --> 44:53.982
It is not too late.

44:53.982 --> 44:59.571
Do you know what I was thinking
in that moment when I could smell him

44:59.571 --> 45:03.575
and I could feel his breath on mine?

45:06.328 --> 45:07.579
"How dare you?

45:09.373 --> 45:13.043
What right do you have to be happy?"

45:13.544 --> 45:15.796
<i>Stop. Do not do that.</i>

45:16.338 --> 45:19.466
You're the one who said
we were stepping out of our comfort zones.

45:20.884 --> 45:21.760
You're right.

45:25.639 --> 45:28.767
Okay. All right.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.520
How is it going with Kam?

45:34.481 --> 45:36.233
It's a dream come true.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.866
-  Cooper.
- Dave.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.826
- How are you?
- Burning the midnight oil?

45:45.826 --> 45:48.537
- I'm impressed.
- Well, I'm just checking on Francesca.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.831
We've got the presentation tomorrow.

45:50.831 --> 45:54.042
I can't wait to hear it.
You two are on fire.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.254
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Betcha.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.139
Hey.

46:10.350 --> 46:11.727
I'm so glad you called.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.521
Stop talking.

46:18.901 --> 46:19.943
Cooper.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.112
What's going on?

46:22.112 --> 46:24.740
<i>♪ Up the whole night ♪</i>

46:26.074 --> 46:29.495

46:31.914 --> 46:34.708

46:34.708 --> 46:36.710

46:58.482 --> 47:00.067
What the hell's going on?

47:02.361 --> 47:04.071
 <i>Love can be scary.</i>

47:05.072 --> 47:06.823
<i>But life can be scary,</i>

47:07.908 --> 47:11.245
<i>and ultimately, a series of risks,</i>

47:13.080 --> 47:14.373

<i>the ones you don't,</i>

47:18.335 --> 47:20.712
<i>the ones you wish you had.</i>

47:21.880 --> 47:24.841
<i>But perhaps, the biggest risk of all</i>

47:25.551 --> 47:28.387
<i>is allowing yourself to let go.</i>

47:31.348 --> 47:33.684

What are you doing?

48:37.789 --> 48:39.124
Do you guys know each other?

48:39.750 --> 48:41.543
Brad's one of my investors.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.673
Oh, my God.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.343
He's the guy.

48:52.179 --> 48:54.806
Hey, honey. Who's this?
