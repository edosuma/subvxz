Oh...

01:41.035 --> 01:42.468
[sniffles]

01:43.637 --> 01:45.704
Hey, what's wrong?

01:49.944 --> 01:52.144
You heard what the doctor said.

01:53.614 --> 01:58.117
Well, so, maybe we get
a second opinion, hm?

01:58.152 --> 02:00.652
Griff,
she was the second opinion.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.122
[sighs]

02:04.225 --> 02:06.959
[sighs] Well...

02:06.994 --> 02:08.827
did you hear everyone tonight?

02:08.896 --> 02:12.030
They think we're having kids,
like, tomorrow.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.032
Everyone knows we're trying.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.268
So...

02:18.205 --> 02:19.471
Maybe we adopt.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.206
[chuckles] Celebrities adopt.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.542
Politicians create bloodlines.
You know this.

02:23.577 --> 02:27.246
All right. So... how about
we hire a surrogate?

02:27.281 --> 02:30.682
All right, so I'm supposed
to pay some woman we barely know

02:30.751 --> 02:32.885
how much
to help you do your job?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.154
Excuse me?

02:35.256 --> 02:38.056
The last time I checked,
my only job

02:38.125 --> 02:41.026
was to be a good wife
and to become a good mother!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.797
I can still do that.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.766
Yeah.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.468
Well,

02:49.570 --> 02:51.370
apparently, you can't.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.873
What is that supposed to mean?

02:54.909 --> 02:58.677
-Where are you going?
-To have a nightcap.

02:58.746 --> 03:02.714
Or three. And figure out
what to do about us.

03:02.783 --> 03:06.485
What to do about us?
Wh-what does that mean?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.420
It means I don't know
if I wanna be with someone

03:08.455 --> 03:10.255
who can't have my kids.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.758
That's not a part of the deal
I signed on for.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.962
You know, when I first met you,
I always knew

03:16.997 --> 03:18.297
you were a shallow prick!

03:18.365 --> 03:20.899
But then I thought,
"Maybe I could fix him."

03:20.935 --> 03:23.669
But, apparently,
... can't be fixed!

03:26.574 --> 03:28.240
Yeah.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.942
Well, at least
we can thank my mother

03:29.977 --> 03:32.144
for insisting on that pre-nup.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.737
Okay, sophomores, thank you.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.056
Oh. See you soon. Thank you.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.495
I think we have to go
with Carrington, right?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.564
I mean, we don't have anything
like her in the opening lineup.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.865
Got it.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.667
Guess what?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.202
Early acceptance
to a university,

04:30.271 --> 04:31.937
driving distance from home.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.605
-Mom...
-[Kayla] You made it.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.107
I made it.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.142
-Congratulations.
-You made what?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.578
-The drill team.
-Oh, my gosh!

04:39.613 --> 04:42.414
Girl's got some moves!

04:42.516 --> 04:43.749
This calls for celebration.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.651
I'm ordering you
and take-out tonight.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.352
Oh, Shonda, honey,
that's really sweet.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.354
-But you don't have to do that.
-Oh, I'm not paying for it.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.989
Your new gallery budget's
paying for that.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.624
[laughs]
Hey...

04:52.660 --> 04:54.726
So did Ms. Meadows
sing you any praises?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.295
Ah, praises? No.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.063
She hardly game me a head-nod,

04:58.098 --> 05:00.932
but that was a first,
so I'll take it.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.735
[chuckles] Yeah.
Your dad's gonna be so proud!

05:03.771 --> 05:06.638
Oh, oh. Hi, hi-hi, yeah.
Hello. Hello.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.144
So what does that even mean?
I mean, practice after school?

05:12.212 --> 05:14.012
You're gonna need a car
or something? Hm?

05:14.048 --> 05:16.381
Dad, don't tease
unless you mean it.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.317
-Well...
-Yeah, honey, don't tease.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.252
She hasn't even taken
driver's ed yet.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.988
I know, but I'm going
to be able to next month.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.691
Because you know what else?

05:25.726 --> 05:26.825
-Hm.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.861
I'm turning 16 in October.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.830
Oh, 16!

05:31.865 --> 05:33.498
Our little one's growing up
so fast.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.234
-Don't remind me.
-Where does the time go?

05:36.270 --> 05:38.470
You will always be
a little girl to me.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.539
Don't forget it.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.007
So is that what you really want?
A car?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.942
Because we did talk,
if she kept her grades up,

05:43.977 --> 05:45.510
we would get her one.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.747
Well, I was hoping

05:48.782 --> 05:51.116
that you guys might consider
throwing me

05:51.151 --> 05:54.219
a sweet-sixteen party, instead.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.721
I-I mean,
Misty and May on my team,

05:55.823 --> 05:57.055
both had theirs last year

05:57.091 --> 05:59.658
and they were asking
if I'm having one.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.226
When did you become Miss Social?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.928
Come on, mom, is it so bad

06:02.963 --> 06:05.364
that I wanna have a little fun
while I'm still in school?

06:05.399 --> 06:08.166
Besides, I was hoping
to make it a benefit,

06:08.235 --> 06:11.770
so to help raise money for kids
in my class who need assistance

06:11.805 --> 06:13.705
paying for their college
applications next year.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.708
Did you just hear that?
That's our daughter.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.510
Good for you. Yeah.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.945
Okay, fine.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.580
If you want
a sweet-sixteen party,

06:21.615 --> 06:23.615
we will throw you
a sweet-sixteen party,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.517
and it will be epic.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.018
-Epic!
-Epic!

06:27.054 --> 06:28.787
Really?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.856
Thanks, mom.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.658
-And dad. Ahem.
-And dad.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.261
Well, I guess we have to find
ourselves a party planner then.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.963
Mm, why can't,
why can't you do it?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.298
Honey, you know I'm not good
at party planning

06:40.367 --> 06:42.167
and social stuff.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.669
No, I don't.
Why don't you, uh, tell me?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.671
-Our wedding. Remember?
-Mm-hmm.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.874
I sent the cake
to the wrong venue,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.910
I hired that One Hit Wonders
wedding band.

06:51.979 --> 06:55.414
Honey, you know
we both like One Hit Wonders.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.717
-[chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.585
Okay, fine.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.454
But you know what? This
gallery opening, I'm just...

07:02.489 --> 07:05.457
I'm kinda slammed, and even
with Shonda, I'm drowning, so...

07:05.492 --> 07:06.758
Uh, it's fine, mom.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.893
If you don't think
you have the time,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.294
it's okay.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.430
No, honey, of course,
I want to help you

07:11.465 --> 07:13.432
and I wanna be there for
your big day as much as I can.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.067
Um, maybe just from
the sidelines, though, you know,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.403
so I don't ruin your big day.

07:22.509 --> 07:26.845
We are going to find you
the best party planner ever.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.414
My only daughter
only turns 16 once.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.083
-[laughs]
-Whoo!

07:32.186 --> 07:33.318
That's what I'm talkin' about.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.953
[crickets chirping]

07:36.890 --> 07:39.825
[intense music]

07:45.032 --> 07:47.399
Well, just like kismet,

07:47.434 --> 07:48.700
here we are.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.703
[music continues]

08:10.324 --> 08:11.823
[chiming]

08:18.532 --> 08:20.198
Whoo! Go, Charlie!

08:29.743 --> 08:32.043
How are we doing today, ladies?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.181
Is that the kind of team spirit
you're gonna be delivering

08:36.216 --> 08:38.617
at our first pep rally
in a couple of weeks?

08:38.652 --> 08:42.087
I said, how are you doing today,
ladies?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.288
[all cheering]

08:43.323 --> 08:45.290
Okay, that is more like it.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.226
I see we have a few new faces
in our midst this fall.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.962
For sophomores,
"Kerry Anderson."

08:50.998 --> 08:52.531
Are you Kayla Crosby's daughter?

08:52.566 --> 08:53.999
Yes, ma'am, she told me

08:54.067 --> 08:55.500
the two of you
went to high school together.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.269
That's right, we did,
she was never really

08:57.304 --> 08:59.804
the drill-team type, so I'm
surprised to see you here.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.674
-But welcome to the team.
Than-k you, Ms. Meadows.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.376
[Meadows]
You guys can all call me coach.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.112
All right then,
time to learn our first routine.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.380
[all cheering]

09:13.687 --> 09:15.420
[sighs]

09:15.455 --> 09:18.023
[whispers] Hold on one second.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.091
Yeah, I just feel like a
sweet-sixteen concept for girls

09:20.127 --> 09:21.826
these days
isn't what it used to be.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.495
Nowadays it can't just be
some silly dance

09:23.530 --> 09:25.096
where you crown
the birthday girl

09:25.132 --> 09:27.666
like an old-school home-coming
coronation or something.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.568
We're talking
top 40s cover band

09:29.603 --> 09:32.938
and a severely strict dress code
for everyone in attendance.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.939
A dress code?

09:33.974 --> 09:34.973
No hoochie skirts two inches

09:35.042 --> 09:35.974
above the knee.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.275
No open-toed shoes, no tuxes

09:37.344 --> 09:39.377
or prom dresses
or anything tacky

09:39.413 --> 09:40.645
or overall snooty.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.614
I mean, like upscale casual,

09:42.649 --> 09:44.549
but still something you can hit
the ping-pong table wearing.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.484
[Kayla] Ping-pong!
I love that idea.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.119
What mother doesn't?
It's a great distraction.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.121
Help all those boys
keep their hands to themselves.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.556
[laughs]

09:51.658 --> 09:53.325
Well, I think I've heard
all I needed to hear.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.626
Kerry, do you have
any other questions for her?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.794
Yeah, no, I'm good. Thanks.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.829
Nice to meet you, Dulcie.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.532
Okay, you're next.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.767
[whispers] Love her.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.302
And this is...
Wait, who are you?

10:04.338 --> 10:05.971
Hi. Lindy Shores.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.039
Hi. Kayla Anderson.
This is my daughter Kerry.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.408
-Hi! Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.978
I love your dress.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.780
Oh! Wow, thank you.
Well, I, I love your shoes.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.716
Oh, thanks.
I actually just got them.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.518
My mom said the heel was
a little high, but I disagreed.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.253
Six inches
would be a little high,

10:22.389 --> 10:24.389
but two-and-a-half seems just...

10:24.458 --> 10:26.858
-Just right.
-[laughs]

10:26.893 --> 10:29.894
Okay. Well, they're
growing on me, I guess.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.330
-Why don't you sit down, please?
-[Lindy] Thank you.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.668
Wow! Lindy, you have
a very impressive resume.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.137
"Political fund-raisers,
campaign banquets,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.006
a re-election gala."

10:41.041 --> 10:43.274
Don't you think
you're just a tad overqualified?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.677
Oh, uh, no. I, I've...

10:45.712 --> 10:47.712
[clears throat]
I'm not overqualified.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.315
I've, um, I've also done
kids' birthday parties

10:50.350 --> 10:51.950
and things like that, too.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.385
I only put the political stuff
on there

10:53.420 --> 10:55.553
because my husband is, uh...

10:57.090 --> 11:00.058
was a congressman.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.328
Oh. I'm really sorry
for your loss.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.332
Thank you. It's, um...
been a tough year.

11:07.401 --> 11:10.235
Well, it's great that you have
experience with fund-raisers

11:10.270 --> 11:12.037
because I was hoping
that this party could actually

11:12.072 --> 11:13.738
help raise money
for kids in my class

11:13.840 --> 11:16.007
who can't pay for their
college applications next year.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.277
[chuckles] Wow,
I love that idea, Kerry.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.981
And how kind of you.
That's right up my alley.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.183
Well, why don't you tell us
what else you would suggest

11:25.252 --> 11:26.985
if we decided to hire you?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.354
I do plan on being a part
of the party planning, though,

11:29.423 --> 11:30.955
except, it's not really
up my wheelhouse.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.825
I'm usually dealing more
in the modern art world.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.859
Ah.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.561
Okay, well, my aim would be

11:36.596 --> 11:40.999
to give Kerry
the most fabulous, classy,

11:41.034 --> 11:44.602
super-special sweet sixteen

11:44.705 --> 11:46.204
that I never had.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.975
And I can assure you
that if you hire me,

11:51.011 --> 11:53.812
you will be the envy
of every girl at the party,

11:53.847 --> 11:56.181
have the attention of every boy

11:56.216 --> 12:00.218
and be<i>  the</i>  talk
of Crestwood High all year long

12:00.320 --> 12:01.986
just as it should be.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.254
[chuckles]

12:04.991 --> 12:06.157
[mumbling]

12:07.360 --> 12:08.960
Feel like maybe I should,

12:08.995 --> 12:11.096
I should've left my card.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.931
Yeah, I'm gonna...

12:14.301 --> 12:15.900
Sorry, I forgot to leave my...

12:15.936 --> 12:17.502
[Shonda] Well, girls,
I don't know about you,

12:17.537 --> 12:19.237
but I'm kinda leaning
towards the red-head.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.773
Dulcie does have the best resume
for these kinds of parties.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.742
I mean, she's been doing it
for years.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.544
And who else can make a bunch
of bratty teens happy?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.079
I don't mean you
when I say that, Ker.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.481
Just your friends.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.648
I-I don't know.

12:30.684 --> 12:33.618
I-I kinda liked Lindy the best.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.488
I mean, she just seems
really into what I'm into.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.189
Okay, um...

12:38.291 --> 12:40.792
Well, how about I see
if I can get Dulcie first?

12:40.861 --> 12:44.863
Lindy seems a little elitist
for my taste.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.166
Okay.
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.434
[sighs]

12:50.670 --> 12:53.571
[intense music]

13:21.368 --> 13:22.867
[doorbell rings]

13:30.277 --> 13:32.377
-[barks]
-[Dulcie] Shh!

13:36.583 --> 13:40.051
-Dulcie Lowe, yes?
-I'm Dulcie. Can I help you?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.586
You probably don't remember me,

13:41.688 --> 13:43.788
but we ran into each other
earlier today.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.890
We were both interviewing
for the party planning position.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.526
-Kerry Anderson...
-Okay.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.528
I'm sorry,
how did you even find me?

13:50.564 --> 13:53.832
Oh, uh, well, strangely, I
happened to notice your resume

13:53.934 --> 13:55.600
when I was leaving my card

13:55.635 --> 13:57.569
and saw that we lived
on the same street.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.205
Well, I'm actually
just, just down there.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.342
Um, t-temporary place while
I get myself back on my feet.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.979
I'm, uh... recently widowed.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.215
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.886
The thing is I just really
need the money right now.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.322
I don't get the life-insurance
money for a while yet

14:17.357 --> 14:19.824
and this job just...

14:19.926 --> 14:21.259
it means everything to me.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.062
Well, again,
I truly am sorry for your loss,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.231
but if you're so hard up
for cash,

14:26.266 --> 14:27.999
you could try selling
that handbag.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.535
It's worth at least $2000
in mint condition,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.303
which it is.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.173
Right, I could...

14:35.275 --> 14:37.375
if this wasn't the last thing
that my husband bought me

14:37.444 --> 14:39.544
before he died.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.846
Clearly, it means
too much for me to sell.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.515
Ah. I understand.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.351
Conversely,
this job means too much to me

14:46.386 --> 14:48.686
to pass up as well.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.121
I don't really know
why you're so worried

14:50.156 --> 14:52.190
when they haven't made
a decision, though.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.359
Or did they?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.527
Dulcie, I will give you

14:56.596 --> 14:58.162
half of everything I make,
okay?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.632
I just need this job.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.634
Lindy, is it?

15:02.702 --> 15:05.603
Only a crazy person
shows up to a stranger's house,

15:05.639 --> 15:07.538
begging for a job
they didn't earn.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.374
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.876
my Malbec is all aired out
and I got to run.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.746
Listen, you don't understand!
I need... Ah!

15:17.384 --> 15:19.284
[dog barks]

15:19.319 --> 15:20.385
[sighs]

15:21.254 --> 15:22.720
[doorbell rings]

15:27.694 --> 15:29.894
-[dog barks]
-Hush, Cher.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.164
[sighs]

15:35.535 --> 15:38.536
Look. I am begging you.
I'll give you anything.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.471
What's it gonna cost
to get this job, okay?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.707
You, a night in jail
if you don't leave.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.876
Now, goodbye!

15:44.911 --> 15:46.110
[sighs]

15:48.782 --> 15:50.181
-[doorbell rings]
-[Dulcie sighs]

15:50.216 --> 15:53.184
[intense music]

16:09.970 --> 16:11.769
I'm calling the police

16:11.871 --> 16:14.238
if you ring my door again!

16:15.008 --> 16:16.474
Crazy.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.251
[music continues]

16:47.941 --> 16:51.709
What kind of person
doesn't feel bad

16:51.811 --> 16:54.879
when someone tells you
their husband was killed?

16:54.914 --> 16:58.850
You are cold and lifeless,
Dulcie. Do you know that?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.018
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.919
How did you even get in here?

17:01.955 --> 17:04.922
Well, it's a stupid place

17:05.025 --> 17:07.325
to hide the key
under the little statue.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.027
Okay. You're insane.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.929
-I'm calling the cops on you.
-Dulcie, no. Listen.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.966
Let's just
talk this through, okay?

17:15.001 --> 17:16.567
You get out of my house
right now and I'll consider

17:16.603 --> 17:18.703
not having you thrown in jail.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.409
[clears throat]

17:44.397 --> 17:47.331
[music continues]

17:55.041 --> 17:56.841
[door creaking]

17:57.444 --> 17:59.243
[Dulcie screams]

18:11.424 --> 18:13.291
-[cell phone chimes]
-Mm...

18:13.359 --> 18:16.861
-Oh, it's the party planner.
-Mm.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.564
What? She says
she's unavailable now.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.299
That's weird.
She was available yesterday.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.934
Why wouldn't she just
answer my call?

18:23.036 --> 18:26.504
Mm. Maybe she got
a, uh, a better job offer.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.207
Does that mean we can hire
the other one I liked?

18:29.242 --> 18:31.776
-Lindy?
-Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.411
I'll call her and see
if she's available to meet here

18:33.446 --> 18:34.812
after school tomorrow.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.391
[ominous music]

18:49.162 --> 18:50.661
[doorbell rings]

18:50.697 --> 18:52.830
Lindy! So good to see you!

18:52.932 --> 18:55.500
Kerry! So wonderful to see you!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.268
I can't believe
I'm actually here.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.370
Lindy, hi, welcome.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.272
Won't you join us? I'm gonna
bring tea to the patio.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.040
Great.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.776
[Lindy] So you're a freshman
this year?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.378
[Kerry] Sophomore, actually.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.280
Since my birthday is so early
in the school year,

19:09.349 --> 19:11.582
most of my friends
are already 16.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.919
-I am the last.
-I loved being 15.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.355
I was on a dance squad
way back when.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.557
Really?
I just joined drill team.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.959
Oh, how I miss those days!

19:22.061 --> 19:24.695
Well, uh, maybe I'll have to
swing by one of your practices

19:24.797 --> 19:27.899
or something sometime and see
what the new generation's like.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.168
Well, I, I doubt
much has changed.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.069
My coach is even old friends
with my mom.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.738
They went to high school
together.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.508
No way! Ah!
Your mom just seems so young.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.545
I can't even believe she has
a daughter your age, anyway.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.079
How old was she
when she had you?

19:42.115 --> 19:46.317
Uh... around 23, I guess.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.321
Wow! Well,
that is just incredible!

19:50.356 --> 19:52.757
And, I mean,
she seems so talented,

19:52.792 --> 19:56.060
having her own art gallery
and all.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.530
You are one lucky girl,
Ms. Kerry Anderson.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.266
And not to mention, you now have
the best party planner

20:02.302 --> 20:05.136
on the West Coast,
playing for your team now, too.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.470
Thank you.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.306
Well, I brought some ideas

20:08.374 --> 20:10.408
for you to take a look at.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.682
Wow!

20:17.717 --> 20:20.651
[chuckles] This stuff
looks really great.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.354
And teal is my favorite color.
How did you know?

20:23.423 --> 20:26.457
I had no idea.
I just love it, too.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.760
Wait, you didn't get
Nicole, Frank and Native Gem

20:29.796 --> 20:32.196
to sponsor this, did you?

20:32.232 --> 20:35.800
Everyone at school
totally loves these brands.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.569
One of the designers at
Native Gem is a friend of mine

20:38.605 --> 20:41.105
and married to an assemblyman,
so I thought

20:41.140 --> 20:43.741
that we would have a raffle
at the entry.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.611
Thank you, Lindy. Oh, my God.
This is gonna be so cool.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.947
-Mom, you have to see this.
-It's amazing. I heard.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.551
I didn't realize
you were so well connected.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.720
She wants to have a real dance,
just like the one I wanted,

20:55.822 --> 20:58.122
with a live DJ and everything.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.459
And... take a look here.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.461
It'll be just like having
your own junior prom,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.329
but as a sophomore.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.667
Oh, that is, is great,
expensive...

21:09.702 --> 21:11.035
Kerry, honey, how many people
were you thinking

21:11.070 --> 21:12.336
of having at this party, anyway?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.071
I think the house realistically

21:14.173 --> 21:16.374
could probably hold 30,
maybe 40, max.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.608
Oh, no!

21:17.710 --> 21:19.210
You don't wanna have
a sweet sixteen

21:19.312 --> 21:20.211
here at the house.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.446
High-schoolers can get crazy,

21:22.515 --> 21:24.582
so, no, we'll rent a venue

21:24.617 --> 21:27.251
like a-a wedding venue
or a big estate

21:27.353 --> 21:29.053
and it'll just be fabulous.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.589
Yeah, who's gonna pay for it?
I don't know.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.624
I'm kidding. Okay, look.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.293
You know,
we probably have a couple

21:35.395 --> 21:36.594
of thousand dollars
put towards this.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.396
The, um, gallery budget is kinda

21:38.431 --> 21:39.697
killing us these days.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.932
How about if I promise

21:41.968 --> 21:45.503
that on a budget of $2000...

21:45.538 --> 21:48.439
I can throw Kerry the
sweet sixteen of the century?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.809
Can we agree on that?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.481
Okay.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.750
-[laughs]
-Okay.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.854
[instrumental music]

22:06.693 --> 22:09.894
So, what do we think
about Lindy?

22:09.929 --> 22:12.196
Is she as great
as Kerry says she is?

22:12.231 --> 22:15.232
Well, she swears that the budget
won't be a problem,

22:15.268 --> 22:18.769
but I can't help thinking
that this party planner's gonna

22:18.805 --> 22:21.772
end up costing us a lot more
than we wanna spend.

22:21.874 --> 22:25.009
Ah, well,
I'm sure it'll all work out.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.777
You may just have to remind her
that our daughter

22:26.813 --> 22:30.047
isn't some birthday diva. Nope.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.449
I mean, all she wants to do
is have fun

22:31.484 --> 22:32.483
with her friends, is that right?

22:32.518 --> 22:34.552
Yeah, that's what I thought...

22:34.587 --> 22:36.454
until Lindy got her
all worked up

22:36.522 --> 22:38.689
and now
I'm, I'm just not so sure.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.791
All right.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.061
It should be fun.

22:44.097 --> 22:45.563
Goodnight.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.366
Goodnight.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.804
Someone called party planner?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.606
Lindy, what are you doing here?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.408
Well, I told you
I wanted to check out

22:57.443 --> 22:59.777
one of your
drill-team practices.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.446
And you must be the BFF,
Savannah.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.682
-Yeah. I-I love your car.
-[Lindy] I love your hair.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.684
[laughs] Oh...

23:06.753 --> 23:08.452
So shall we?

23:08.521 --> 23:10.287
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:10.323 --> 23:13.157
[indistinct chatter]

23:13.192 --> 23:16.861
-[whistle blows]
-And five, six, seven, eight.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.765
Very nice, Misty.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.668
Good form, Savannah.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.775
Kerry, where's the life

34:02.608 --> 34:05.609
Kerry's a good kid.
There's nothin' to worry about.

34:08.981 --> 34:11.348
And when you talk with her,
just make sure

34:11.383 --> 34:12.783
she knows we don't approve.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.551
[scoffs] Oh, trust me,
I am making sure

34:14.620 --> 34:15.752
she knows we don't approve.

34:15.788 --> 34:16.953
Good.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.222
[sighs]

34:19.291 --> 34:22.492
It's not just the alcohol,
though, Jas.

34:22.528 --> 34:25.862
She's been acting different
lately, in general.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.065
Honey...

34:28.100 --> 34:29.733
[sighs]

34:29.768 --> 34:32.736
She's a teenager.
What do you expect?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.004
[chuckles]

34:35.074 --> 34:37.374
You don't think she's...

34:37.443 --> 34:40.310
suddenly figured out anything,
do you?

34:40.345 --> 34:42.846
Oh, maybe it's time
we just tell her the truth.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.148
No. No.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.651
No, because we both agreed
we wouldn't tell her

34:47.719 --> 34:50.520
till the summer
after her sophomore year.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.924
If we told her right now, it
would ruin her entire birthday.

34:54.026 --> 34:56.226
I mean...

34:56.261 --> 34:58.328
And you don't want that, do you?

34:58.363 --> 35:00.597
Of course, I don't want that.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.837
[Kerry] Uh, Coach Meadows?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.872
I'm sorry to bother you.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.477
Uh, I was just wondering.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.680
I'm having my sweet-sixteen
party the weekend after next

35:16.715 --> 35:19.316
and my party planner thought
that it might be fun

35:19.418 --> 35:20.984
for the team to perform there.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.988
Uh, I was just wondering if,
or what you thought about it

35:25.023 --> 35:26.923
or i-if it was cool with you.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.593
Um, I mean,
that sounds great, Kerry,

35:29.661 --> 35:31.895
but the drill team exists
to support the athletes

35:31.930 --> 35:34.564
performing at half-times
and pep rallies,

35:34.600 --> 35:37.100
not entertaining
at your birthday party.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.636
Besides, do you really think
that you're ready to perform

35:39.671 --> 35:42.606
in front of a crowd? Because
I think you need more time.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.407
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you're right.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.510
I'm sorry that I asked.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.145
Uh, thank you.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.649
[cell phone beeps]

35:58.490 --> 35:59.756
[cell phone beeps]

36:02.327 --> 36:05.228
[dramatic music]

36:28.420 --> 36:33.089
Huh? After-school house calls
with the basketball coach.

36:33.125 --> 36:36.660
[chuckles]
Something stinks in suburbia.

36:36.762 --> 36:45.936
[music continues]

36:45.971 --> 36:47.704
[both chuckling]

36:48.507 --> 36:49.773
[laughs]

36:51.410 --> 36:54.311
[footsteps approaching]

36:56.081 --> 36:58.448
Excuse me. Can I help you?

36:58.483 --> 37:01.218
You're Marlow Meadows
and you're Coach Glenn, yes?

37:01.253 --> 37:02.385
I'm sorry,
but how do we know you?

37:02.421 --> 37:04.554
We don't, but you know Kerry.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.389
I saw you at the practice
the other day.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.425
Look, I don't wanna be here
anymore than either of you

37:08.493 --> 37:10.227
want the coach's wife to know.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.696
I just wanted to show you these.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.936
Okay, then, so as you know,

37:19.972 --> 37:23.406
Kerry wants the drill team
to perform at her sweet sixteen

37:23.475 --> 37:25.308
and now that you've seen
what I have here,

37:25.377 --> 37:27.010
you're gonna make that happen

37:27.045 --> 37:30.013
if you want these deleted after.
Do we have a deal?

37:30.048 --> 37:33.416
You're seriously blackmailing me
over some silly little party?

37:33.452 --> 37:35.652
[Lindy] It's not
some silly little party.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.655
This is gonna be
<i> the</i>  party of the year.

37:38.724 --> 37:42.058
And what Kerry wants,
I make sure she gets.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.927
Did Kayla put you up to this?

37:43.962 --> 37:46.229
Kayla has nothing to do
with this.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.832
This has to do with me, you,

37:48.867 --> 37:51.401
him and his wife, Donna.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.536
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:53.572 --> 37:54.871
Please don't say anything
to my wife.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.207
-I've two kids at home.
-Yeah?

37:57.242 --> 37:58.441
Well, then,
maybe you should think about

37:58.510 --> 38:00.143
getting back to them, huh?

38:00.178 --> 38:04.147
All right, well, I've got places
to be, so I've gotta go.

38:04.182 --> 38:07.584
But I look forward
to seeing you both at the party.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.021
Have a lovely evenin'.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.323
Bye!

38:16.128 --> 38:19.296
[Lindy]
So what did she say exactly?

38:19.331 --> 38:22.499
Uh, not that one.
The neckline's not right.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.901
Well, she just told everyone
that they're doing the dance

38:24.936 --> 38:26.303
at my birthday.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.872
I mean,
at first people were confused

38:28.940 --> 38:31.941
because I had told them
that they weren't,

38:31.977 --> 38:35.045
but then everyone
got super excited.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.380
-[Kerry] It was amazing!
-Wow!

38:37.449 --> 38:40.116
Well, that is amazing.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.552
Yay!

38:42.587 --> 38:45.255
Uh, well, now this'll give you
a chance to show off

38:45.324 --> 38:47.257
your sexy dance moves
to Charlie.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.759
Uh, uh, I still need
a lot of practice.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.194
It's not perfect yet.

38:51.296 --> 38:54.030
Uh, that one's okay,

38:54.066 --> 38:56.266
but I think we can do
much better than okay.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.967
Here, try this one on.

39:01.273 --> 39:03.973
And anyway, you'll get a chance
to get the moves down.

39:05.644 --> 39:09.012
Why don't you invite the team to
the venue tomorrow to rehearse?

39:09.047 --> 39:10.380
-[Kerry] Really?
-Yeah.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.215
You gotta look at it anyway.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.819
[Kerry] Oh, thanks, Lindy,
that's perfect!

39:15.887 --> 39:17.287
Now, you're pretty awesome.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.823
I mean, you're gonna make
a great mom one day.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.092
-[Kerry exhales]
-[mellow music]

39:24.396 --> 39:27.263
Hey. Are you okay?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.934
Is it, is it,
is it something I said?

39:32.938 --> 39:35.672
No, not at all. It's, uh...

39:37.342 --> 39:39.342
It's just that I, um...

39:42.280 --> 39:44.581
recently found out that I...

39:47.252 --> 39:49.919
can't actually have children,
is all.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.423
Lindy.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.227
[music continues]

39:57.262 --> 39:59.629
I'm-I'm so sorry.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.132
I, um...

40:05.937 --> 40:08.104
I was pregnant for...

40:09.141 --> 40:11.608
a short period...

40:11.676 --> 40:13.910
but then I lost the baby.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.179
I couldn't get pregnant again
after.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.850
That is so awful.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.620
But, hey...

40:23.655 --> 40:26.289
there's lots
of different kinds of options

40:26.324 --> 40:28.925
for having kids these days.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.827
You can still be a mom.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.530
Yeah. Thank you.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.131
And it's just been so nice
being able

40:35.200 --> 40:37.600
to plan this party with you.

40:37.636 --> 40:41.371
It's kind of like having
my own adopted daughter.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.673
[both laughing]

40:43.708 --> 40:45.942
Well, I think
that's a really healthy outlook.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.044
Yeah.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.246
[instrumental music]

40:50.315 --> 40:52.549
Uh, oh, wow!

40:52.584 --> 40:53.950
I think that's the one.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.418
-Really?
-Yes.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.187
I mean, it's really pretty.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.955
But, uh, did you see the tag?

40:58.990 --> 41:02.859
It's way, way outside the budget
my mom set for the dress--

41:02.894 --> 41:05.495
Pshh! Hush!
I got the difference.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.831
-What? No!
-I insist!

41:07.866 --> 41:11.334
You want the perfect party,
you<i>  need</i>  the perfect dress.

41:11.403 --> 41:14.604
Now, if we just take it in
a little bit here,

41:14.639 --> 41:16.206
and<i>  voila!</i>

41:18.109 --> 41:20.844
Oh... Thank you, Lindy.

41:22.314 --> 41:25.515
You know, it's funny.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.551
You kind of look like
you could be my daughter.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.620
-[laughs]
-Oh, funny, huh?

41:30.689 --> 41:32.288
[both laughing]

41:32.324 --> 41:35.458
Officially had a boyfriend
or would this be the first?

41:35.494 --> 41:38.161
-[laughs]
-Um...

41:38.263 --> 41:40.597
-Hi, mom.
-Hi, guys. Oh...

41:40.665 --> 41:42.298
Wait, you didn't try on dresses
already, did you?

41:42.334 --> 41:43.900
Oh, I'm so sorry,

41:43.935 --> 41:46.069
but we have to get this
to the tailor's by 6:00

41:46.137 --> 41:47.370
if we want it in time
for the party.

41:47.405 --> 41:49.305
They have a one-week turnaround.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.140
Oh, I-I didn't...
Nobody told me that.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.542
Well, can we at least
see the thing?

41:52.577 --> 41:54.277
Yeah, I'll send you
a screenshot, okay?

41:54.346 --> 41:56.679
Okay, well, I gotta go.
I don't wanna hit traffic.

41:56.748 --> 42:00.283
I don't wanna be late, so I'll
see you tomorrow at the venue

42:00.318 --> 42:02.085
after school,
say, 3:30 for rehearsal?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.586
-Perfect.
-[Lindy] Okay, great.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.821
-Okay, bye.
-[Kerry] Bye!

42:04.923 --> 42:06.055
Bye!

42:06.091 --> 42:08.091
-[chuckles]
-What the hell was that?

42:08.159 --> 42:10.660
You guys are gonna
love the dress, seriously.

42:10.729 --> 42:15.999
-Hopefully more than I love her.
-Yeah.

Ugh, he was so ugly.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.537
Okay, talk to you later.
Oh, bye.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.239
You will never guess
what happened.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.341
-What?
-The police stopped by earlier.

42:58.376 --> 43:00.243
Asking about that party planner
we interviewed.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.645
-Dulcie?
-Yeah. What about her?

43:02.681 --> 43:04.647
Apparently, she was murdered.

43:04.683 --> 43:07.016
-What?
-Yeah. The other night.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.718
And your cell
and the gallery's numbers

43:08.787 --> 43:10.019
were the last numbers
she called,

43:10.088 --> 43:11.421
so they wanted to know
what we knew.

43:11.523 --> 43:12.455
What did you tell them?

43:12.490 --> 43:13.723
That we tried to hire her

43:13.792 --> 43:14.991
and never heard back.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.793
-Now I know why.
-Wow!

43:16.861 --> 43:17.961
Do they know what happened?

43:17.996 --> 43:19.429
Said it was
a home-invasion robbery

43:19.464 --> 43:20.964
gone bad.

43:21.032 --> 43:23.733
Huh! That is just awful!

43:23.768 --> 43:26.102
Right? Should we tell Kerry?

43:26.171 --> 43:28.004
Mm, I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.906
I don't wanna make things worse
than they already are.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.442
What can be worse
than Lindy? Ugh!

43:32.477 --> 43:34.377
Hate that fake smile
she puts on.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.312
"Oh, will send you
a screenshot, okay?

43:36.348 --> 43:39.015
And I have to run,
otherwise I'll hit traffic."

43:39.050 --> 43:42.552
Right, she's probably the only
person who wouldn't feel bad

43:42.587 --> 43:44.921
about what happened
to poor Dulcie.

43:44.990 --> 43:48.825
Oh, God, no! Hate her.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.761
Come on, girls, this way.
All right.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.896
Right this way...

43:53.965 --> 43:54.964
Stop.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.468
Surprise!

43:58.503 --> 44:00.036
Oh, my God!

44:00.138 --> 44:02.472
Lindy, this place is incredible!

44:02.540 --> 44:05.208
-I'm so glad you like it.
-Like, wow!

44:05.276 --> 44:08.811
This is way better
than where you had yours, Misty.

44:08.847 --> 44:11.514
-Yeah, it's pretty dope.
-[laughing]

44:11.549 --> 44:15.385
But I guess
we could celebrate, huh?

44:17.055 --> 44:19.722
What? Savannah said
Lindy wouldn't mind.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.591
Okay, uh, I didn't see anything.

44:21.660 --> 44:24.394
Just have fun
and don't get wasted.

44:24.429 --> 44:27.130
You girls have to rehearse
your routine later.

44:28.466 --> 44:30.433
Uh? Oh, you're not joining them?

44:30.502 --> 44:33.770
No, I'm coming with you.
I wanna check this place out.

44:33.805 --> 44:36.039
Okay, look,
I don't usually drink,

44:36.074 --> 44:38.808
but when I do, I do it
for my friend's birthday, so...

44:38.877 --> 44:39.776
-[Misty] Cheers.
-Thank you.

44:39.844 --> 44:40.877
Cheers.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.915
[Shonda] You know what I think?

44:45.984 --> 44:47.684
I think you should take
the next couple of days off

44:47.719 --> 44:49.419
and go take care of your girl.

44:49.521 --> 44:51.320
You don't need a party planner.

44:51.423 --> 44:53.022
What?
What are you talking about?

44:53.058 --> 44:54.190
I can finish
getting everything ready here

44:54.225 --> 44:56.092
for the opening,
you go help Kerry

44:56.127 --> 44:57.160
with the rest
of the party preppin'

44:57.228 --> 44:59.162
like you know you want to.

44:59.197 --> 45:02.365
She only turns 16 once.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.901
Uh, I don't know. Are you sure?
There's so much to be--

45:04.936 --> 45:07.503
Yeah, and I<i>  love</i>  me
some overtime.

45:07.539 --> 45:10.640
So go, go on. Go check out
the venue and stuff.

45:10.709 --> 45:13.342
Make sure that Lindy girl isn't
blowing your entire budget.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.244
-[laughs] Okay.
-[Shonda chuckles]

45:15.280 --> 45:16.779
You don't have to tell me twice.

45:16.848 --> 45:18.915
[Shonda] Good. I'm the boss now.

45:18.950 --> 45:20.516
[laughs] Okay.

45:20.552 --> 45:22.418
Five, six, seven, eight.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.955
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

45:27.325 --> 45:29.158
One, two, three, four,

45:29.227 --> 45:30.860
five, six, seven...

45:30.895 --> 45:33.896
Kayla! Uh, s-so nice of you
to join us.

45:33.932 --> 45:36.499
-This place is amazing!
-I know, right?

45:36.534 --> 45:39.168
I-I got a pretty great steal
on this venue.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.304
Mom, hey! I didn't know
that you were coming.

45:41.339 --> 45:44.674
I thought you had a big artist
coming to the gallery today.

45:44.709 --> 45:46.943
Well, I actually have
some great news.

45:46.978 --> 45:49.779
Shonda offered to finish up
the rest of the installation

45:49.814 --> 45:53.583
for the opening, so I am all
yours to help with the party.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.885
Oh. Well, that-that was so nice
of Shonda.

45:55.954 --> 45:58.054
And, actually,
that's really great news, Kayla,

45:58.089 --> 46:00.890
because we could totally use
your help decorating this place.

46:00.925 --> 46:03.626
Um, Kerry,
why don't you show her around?

46:03.661 --> 46:06.629
Yeah, mom, come here, um...

46:06.731 --> 46:09.565

47:40.391 --> 47:41.958
Jason, hi. How are you?

47:41.993 --> 47:44.627
-Uh, not good.
-Everything all right?

47:44.662 --> 47:47.129
Uh, you know, Shonda,
Kayla's assistant,

47:47.165 --> 47:49.098
uh, she was attacked last night
at the art gallery.

47:49.167 --> 47:51.868
Oh, my God!
I-i-is everything okay?

47:51.903 --> 47:55.371
Uh, we think so. Looks like
just a nasty concussion.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.607
They're doing more tests
tonight, so Kayla wants to go

47:57.675 --> 47:59.475
down there now
and check her out.

47:59.510 --> 48:00.843
Oh...

48:08.519 --> 48:11.354
-Lindy. Hey.
-Oh, sweetie.

48:11.389 --> 48:15.691
Okay. Thank you, Miranda.
We'll see you soon.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.594
That was her sister.
She said Shonda's awake.

48:20.064 --> 48:23.633
I am so sorry
to hear about all this.

48:23.668 --> 48:25.501
Do you guys know who did it?

48:25.536 --> 48:28.104
No, no, um,
whoever it was,

48:28.139 --> 48:29.972
clearly wanted this new piece
that we got in though,

48:30.008 --> 48:31.607
because...

48:31.643 --> 48:33.876
we had this up-and-coming artist
and they took it.

48:33.912 --> 48:35.745
Uh, you know, I never
should have let her stay there

48:35.847 --> 48:36.913
by herself that late.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.147
Honey, don't say that.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.082
You couldn't have known.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.751
Okay. We have to get going.

48:41.786 --> 48:43.019
-Okay?
-All right.

48:43.054 --> 48:45.187
Well, do you want me
to come, too?

48:45.223 --> 48:46.789
Oh, my gosh. That's right.

48:46.824 --> 48:48.324
We're supposed to pick up
the decorations.

48:48.359 --> 48:50.893
I... You guys go on ahead, okay?

48:50.962 --> 48:52.561
-I'm sorry, I can't.
-Uh, don't...

48:52.597 --> 48:54.397
-Don't even worry about it.
-Hey.

48:54.465 --> 48:56.565
Do you mind watching her
until we get back?

48:56.601 --> 48:57.967
Dad, I'm nearly 16.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.235
And they're just lookin' out

48:59.304 --> 49:00.569
for you, of course.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.805
I will guard her
as if she were my own.

49:02.840 --> 49:06.008
-I'm sorry, honey. Thanks.
-[Jason] Thank you.

49:06.077 --> 49:08.311
Uh, tell Shonda
that I hope she feels better.

49:08.346 --> 49:09.612
[Lindy] Oh.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.615
[mellow music]

49:15.320 --> 49:18.754
All I'm sayin'
is that you need to be smart

49:18.790 --> 49:20.589
when choosin' your mate.

49:20.625 --> 49:24.560
You mean... only date a man
with money?

49:26.331 --> 49:29.832
[laughs]
No. Of course not.

49:29.867 --> 49:31.734
[chuckles]

49:31.803 --> 49:33.636
Now, look,
you're only in high school.

49:33.705 --> 49:36.172
All I'm sayin' is that...

49:36.207 --> 49:39.675
the decisions that you make now
with boys...

49:39.711 --> 49:42.845
can have an affect on you
later in life as well.

49:44.082 --> 49:48.317
I mean,
no one knows better than me.

49:49.554 --> 49:52.021
I got caught up

49:52.090 --> 49:54.857
with the wrong boy
in high school and...

49:56.761 --> 49:58.928
it took me a long time
to grow up

49:58.997 --> 50:01.630
and realize what I deserved.

50:01.733 --> 50:03.666
Now, I like Charlie,

50:03.701 --> 50:06.802
but I'm just sayin'
that you have to be realistic.

50:06.838 --> 50:08.604
[chuckles]

50:08.639 --> 50:11.440
Okay. Thanks,<i>  mom.</i>

50:11.542 --> 50:14.143
[laughing]

50:14.245 --> 50:16.445
Oh, is this it?

50:17.815 --> 50:19.815
Yeah, these are
all the family albums

50:19.917 --> 50:21.884
down to the year I was born.

50:21.919 --> 50:25.287
Okay, well, we're gonna wanna
pull about 40 to 50 pics

50:25.356 --> 50:28.491
for the collage...
So let's have a look.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.159
[clears throat]

50:31.662 --> 50:32.995
Huh?

50:33.698 --> 50:36.565
Seems strange...

50:36.634 --> 50:39.735
There's not any photos
from your birth.

50:40.471 --> 50:43.172
It's kind of weird.

50:43.207 --> 50:45.608
Huh.

50:45.643 --> 50:46.842
[Lindy] Then maybe
you were adopted.

50:46.911 --> 50:48.711
I mean, you don't really look

50:48.746 --> 50:51.380
that much like Kayla
or that much like your father,

50:51.416 --> 50:52.982
for that matter.

50:54.519 --> 50:57.386
[laughs] I'm teasin'!

50:57.422 --> 51:00.756
I'm sure they're in
a, a separate special album

51:00.792 --> 51:02.825
or something from the hospital.

51:03.528 --> 51:04.693
Yeah.

51:06.264 --> 51:10.032
Maybe.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.640
-Hey, hon.
-Hi.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.875
What's goin' on?

51:19.944 --> 51:21.844
I was just pulling photos
for the collage

51:21.879 --> 51:24.180
that Lindy's projecting
at the party.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.116
How's Shonda?

51:27.151 --> 51:28.984
She's good.

51:29.087 --> 51:30.653
She's barking orders
at the nurses

51:30.688 --> 51:32.455
and, um, she's eating.

51:32.490 --> 51:33.856
So I think
she's gonna be just fine.

51:33.891 --> 51:35.825
[chuckles] Yeah.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.693
How was the venue?

51:37.795 --> 51:40.496
Mm. It's perfect.

51:40.531 --> 51:41.797
-[Kayla sighs]
-[Jason] Good.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.999
[Kayla] Well, that's great.

51:44.068 --> 51:47.336
Um, we are so tired, honey,
um...

51:48.873 --> 51:51.340
We're gonna go to bed, okay?

51:51.375 --> 51:54.743
I'll make you breakfast
in the morning.

51:54.846 --> 51:57.613
There aren't any photos of me
with you guys at the hospital

51:57.648 --> 51:59.415
when I was born.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.021
Why not?

52:14.966 --> 52:17.199
Where are my birth photos?

52:17.802 --> 52:19.068
Honey...

52:22.373 --> 52:24.607
It was always our intention
to tell you

52:24.675 --> 52:27.042
after your sixteenth birthday,
that's always--

52:27.111 --> 52:28.611
Tell me what?

52:29.881 --> 52:32.915
[voice breaking]
Honey, you were ours.

52:32.950 --> 52:35.284
When you were less than
a month old, you were ours--

52:35.319 --> 52:36.886
I am adopted?

52:36.921 --> 52:37.887
[Kayla] You've always been ours.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.622
I am adopted?

52:41.959 --> 52:45.327
And you both kept it from me.

52:45.363 --> 52:48.864
And now there's nothing
that can be said anymore.

52:51.269 --> 52:52.635
[stammering]

52:53.571 --> 52:55.304
You know, I always wondered

52:55.339 --> 52:58.541
why I wasn't as good an artist
as you, mom,

52:58.576 --> 53:01.677
and why I didn't have your hair
and your skin!

53:01.712 --> 53:03.345
[sobbing] Well, honey,
you're an amazing artist.

53:03.381 --> 53:06.615
Why I didn't have
any of dad's features at all!

53:06.684 --> 53:08.617
And now I know

53:08.653 --> 53:11.587
that the people who are
supposed to be my family,

53:11.656 --> 53:13.889
the people who lied to me,

53:13.925 --> 53:17.393
weren't even my family at all.

You seemed off today.

55:23.321 --> 55:24.687
Uh, yeah.

55:26.657 --> 55:29.825
You went to school
with my mom...

55:29.894 --> 55:33.595

that I was adopted, didn't you?

55:36.033 --> 55:38.500
Everyone knew, except me.

Kerry, your mom
was a really kind and sweet

55:44.241 --> 55:46.408
and beautiful girl in school.

55:46.444 --> 55:49.278
Everyone loved her and she

make things easy on her.

I hoped you making the team
and making you one of my best

56:38.763 --> 56:40.396
Hey!

56:40.498 --> 56:43.799
Why does it say Lowe
on the back of Cher's dog tag?

56:46.771 --> 56:48.303
Oh, um...

56:49.173 --> 56:51.473
That was my maiden name.

56:53.210 --> 56:54.476
-Okay.
-Okay.

56:54.512 --> 56:57.613
So why don't we, um,
order some yummy takeout

56:57.715 --> 57:01.550
and make a playlist for the DJ?

57:01.585 --> 57:05.354
You know, I, I should probably
be getting home

57:05.423 --> 57:08.424
before my parents freak out
again and start calling me.

57:08.492 --> 57:09.958
[Lindy] What, are we being,
like,

57:10.027 --> 57:11.860
considerate
of their feelings now

57:11.896 --> 57:14.763
even though they weren't
considerate of yours?

57:16.801 --> 57:19.168
I'm sorry.
That was out of line, I just...

57:19.270 --> 57:20.669
[sighs]

57:20.704 --> 57:24.006
-I'm just still upset for you.
-It'll be fine.

57:24.108 --> 57:25.474
I mean, I'm still
not talking to them,

57:25.509 --> 57:27.443
but... uh,

57:27.478 --> 57:30.112
still I should
probably be getting home.

57:41.158 --> 57:43.192
Marlow?

57:43.227 --> 57:44.560
What are you doing here?

57:44.695 --> 57:46.662
I wanted to talk to you.

57:51.936 --> 57:54.436
A couple of years
out of college, I assumed,

57:54.472 --> 57:56.171
you adopted a baby girl.

57:56.273 --> 57:58.907
You were suddenly posting
baby photos on social media

57:59.009 --> 58:01.577
without ever having posted
you were pregnant.

58:01.612 --> 58:04.880
I didn't realize
you followed me.

58:04.915 --> 58:08.283
Technically, I didn't,
but I did.

58:08.319 --> 58:11.053
Um, anyway, you had just bought
a, a beautiful house

58:11.088 --> 58:13.455
with your husband,
and you both looked very happy,

58:13.491 --> 58:15.924
and I was happy for you,
believe it or not.

58:15.993 --> 58:19.361
I mean, maybe I was,
well, a little jealous.

58:19.396 --> 58:21.763
I've always been jealous of you.

58:21.832 --> 58:25.601
-Especially, back in school.
-What?

58:25.703 --> 58:29.137
Marlow, you were
the most popular, beautiful girl

58:29.240 --> 58:30.739
in school.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.541
Why would you ever
be jealous of me?

58:32.576 --> 58:33.942
Well, people liked me
because I was pretty

58:34.078 --> 58:35.777
and fun to gossip about.

58:35.813 --> 58:38.514
People liked you
because you were kind

58:38.549 --> 58:40.315
and artistic

58:40.351 --> 58:43.218
and you cared about things
that mattered.

58:43.254 --> 58:46.054
Your daughter, she's like you,
she wants to help people

58:46.123 --> 58:49.491
and she is, she's good
at anything she does.

58:49.527 --> 58:52.361
She is your daughter
through and through.

58:52.396 --> 58:55.931
-You know that.
-Thank you.

58:55.966 --> 58:59.568
[sighs] Unfortunately, she's not
talking to me right now.

58:59.603 --> 59:02.104
I'm sorry to hear that.

59:02.206 --> 59:05.340
Well, I hope she comes around.

59:05.442 --> 59:07.643
Anyway, the reason
that I stopped by is to tell you

59:07.678 --> 59:09.711
that I think
you need to be very careful

59:09.780 --> 59:11.213
around your party planner.

59:11.248 --> 59:13.215
What?

59:13.317 --> 59:15.851
Why would you say that?
Did something happen?

59:15.886 --> 59:20.289
Um, she threatened to expose
an affair I was having

59:20.391 --> 59:22.658
with a married co-worker
and have us both fired

59:22.693 --> 59:25.360
if I didn't let the dance team
perform in Kerry's party.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.195
When?

59:27.298 --> 59:29.531
Last week
she trespassed on my property

59:29.567 --> 59:31.900
and antagonized us
like a crazy person.

59:31.936 --> 59:34.670
[dramatic music]

59:34.705 --> 59:36.605
Wow! I-I, uh...

59:36.640 --> 59:38.640
I mean, that's crazy,
I knew she was rigid

59:38.676 --> 59:40.742
in her party planning,
but threatening you?

59:40.778 --> 59:43.679
Yeah, yeah, I know.
It does sound crazy.

59:43.714 --> 59:45.280
And that's why
I wanted to tell you the truth

59:45.316 --> 59:47.416
about everything else first.

59:47.451 --> 59:50.619
I really don't think you should
trust her around your daughter.

59:53.324 --> 59:56.258
[dramatic music]

1:00:21.852 --> 1:00:23.218
-Yes. Thank you.
-[Charlie] Thank you.

1:00:23.253 --> 1:00:26.888
-[Kerry] Mm.
-Oh.

1:00:26.991 --> 1:00:28.857
You seem better today.

1:00:28.892 --> 1:00:30.926
Did you finally
talk to your parents?

1:00:30.961 --> 1:00:34.129
No, but I did finally
get some sleep.

1:00:34.231 --> 1:00:36.198
Thank you, guys,
for being so sweet

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:38.166
and checking on me so much.

1:00:38.235 --> 1:00:39.668
You're welcome.

1:00:39.703 --> 1:00:41.870
Maybe now
you can talk to your mom

1:00:41.905 --> 1:00:44.573
so she'll stop texting me
to check in on you.

1:00:44.675 --> 1:00:47.075
I'm gonna have to talk to them
eventually, huh?

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:49.011
Yes, you are.

1:00:51.582 --> 1:00:53.582
You so sure about that?

1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:59.921
Well, I mean, they've only been
lying to you for, what,

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:01.990
the past 15 years.

1:01:03.193 --> 1:01:06.028
-Hi, guys.
-Uh, Lindy, hey.

1:01:06.063 --> 1:01:07.829
Oh... Uh, what are you
doing here?

1:01:07.865 --> 1:01:10.766
Today is the day
we try on your dress.

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:12.934
For the party.
You didn't forget, did you?

1:01:12.970 --> 1:01:16.304
I'm, um, I'm so sorry.
I, I totally forgot. Uh...

1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:18.073
Guys, I'll-I'll see you later.

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:19.341
-Bye.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:01:19.376 --> 1:01:21.309
-I'll text you later.
-Okay.

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:22.577
Bye.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:27.616
-Uh, that was weird.
-[Charlie] Yeah.

1:01:27.651 --> 1:01:30.085
Do you think she followed us
here after school?

1:01:30.187 --> 1:01:31.553
I don't know, I mean,
unless she has a GPS

1:01:31.655 --> 1:01:33.255
tracking device
on Kerry's phone.

1:01:33.290 --> 1:01:35.190
At this point,
I wouldn't be surprised.

1:01:35.225 --> 1:01:37.426
Well, uh, that lady
gives me the creeps.

1:01:37.461 --> 1:01:40.228
Yeah, I really liked her
at first,

1:01:40.330 --> 1:01:43.031
but, I mean, now...
What was that?

1:01:43.067 --> 1:01:45.033
-That was weird.
-You should text her mom.

1:01:50.407 --> 1:01:52.574
Are you sure...

1:01:52.643 --> 1:01:53.875
you're okay now?

1:01:53.911 --> 1:01:56.178
[sighs] Yeah, I'm fine.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:59.715
I just have to talk
to my mother now is all.

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:03.051
Why are you still
calling her that? Your mother.

1:02:03.153 --> 1:02:04.953
Because she is.

1:02:04.988 --> 1:02:07.589
I mean, despite everything
that's happened.

1:02:07.658 --> 1:02:10.192
I just, I-I don't,
I don't wanna ruin anything

1:02:10.227 --> 1:02:11.326
for the party, you know?

1:02:11.361 --> 1:02:13.762
[door opens]

1:02:13.797 --> 1:02:16.231
Lindy, hi, um, I'm not sure why

1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:18.567
what's happening with our family
is any of your business.

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:20.102
But can you tell me
where you've had

1:02:20.204 --> 1:02:21.970
my daughter
for the last three hours?

1:02:22.005 --> 1:02:24.639
Sure, we just went
to pick up her dress

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:26.908
and then
we grabbed a quick salad.

1:02:26.944 --> 1:02:28.210
Well, you didn't tell us
any of that.

1:02:28.245 --> 1:02:29.478
You also didn't tell us
you were dropping

1:02:29.513 --> 1:02:31.146
her off last night either, so...

1:02:31.181 --> 1:02:33.381
Well, she needed to work
on her routine last night

1:02:33.417 --> 1:02:35.884
and someone needed to help her.

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:38.353
I know she wasn't speaking
to you, so...

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:39.788
Kerry, honey,
is all of this true?

1:02:39.823 --> 1:02:42.057
Of course, mom.
Why wouldn't it be?

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:43.892
Just wondering,
'cause, uh, Lindy's been hiding

1:02:43.961 --> 1:02:45.260
some other things from us.

1:02:45.295 --> 1:02:47.696
Oh, I'm keeping secrets
hidden now?

1:02:47.731 --> 1:02:49.431
[scoffs] That's rich.

1:02:49.466 --> 1:02:51.399
Yeah, mom.
What are you talking about?

1:02:51.435 --> 1:02:54.269
Apparently, Lindy here
threatened one of your teachers

1:02:54.304 --> 1:02:56.872
at your school and used you
as her reason for doing it.

1:02:56.907 --> 1:02:59.608
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:02:59.643 --> 1:03:02.177
That's ludicrous!
Just another lie.

1:03:02.212 --> 1:03:04.412
Lindy, we appreciate
everything you've done

1:03:04.448 --> 1:03:05.847
to get this party ready,

1:03:05.883 --> 1:03:07.816
but we're gonna take it
from here.

1:03:07.851 --> 1:03:09.551
Yeah. We're done.

1:03:11.522 --> 1:03:13.388
Kerry, wait. Just give me
a second to explain.

1:03:13.423 --> 1:03:15.690
It-it meant nothing, okay,
it was...

1:03:15.726 --> 1:03:17.626
Lindy, remove your hand
from my daughter

1:03:17.661 --> 1:03:19.628
before I remove it myself.

1:03:24.635 --> 1:03:26.067
You're fired.

I just wanted to call
and apologize

1:03:50.761 --> 1:03:51.993
for what happened earlier.

1:03:52.029 --> 1:03:54.563
It's all just
a big misunderstanding.

Look, I know that I've been
a little off with you lately

1:03:57.668 --> 1:03:59.668
and I'm sorry, it's just that,

you know,
ever since I lost the baby,

1:04:02.039 --> 1:04:05.507
it has just been so nice getting
to spend this time with you

1:04:05.542 --> 1:04:07.242
and getting closer to you.

1:04:07.311 --> 1:04:09.211
Please, forgive me, Kerry.

Okay, so call-call you back
in a little bit, all right?

I needed to apologize
for not telling you sooner.

Well, you did what you thought
you had to do.

1:04:47.684 --> 1:04:51.853
And... I thought about it, too,

1:04:51.889 --> 1:04:55.490

a right time, huh?

1:04:55.525 --> 1:04:56.691

1:20:44.540 --> 1:20:47.107
No, but I-I will shoot you.

1:20:47.143 --> 1:20:48.776
Kerry...

1:20:50.479 --> 1:20:52.847
Don't you see?

1:20:52.882 --> 1:20:54.615
I<i>  am</i>  your mother.

1:20:54.650 --> 1:20:57.117
-What?
-What?

1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:59.854
-No...
-Yes!

1:20:59.956 --> 1:21:02.690
I am her mother.

1:21:02.725 --> 1:21:03.924
Kerry...

1:21:04.994 --> 1:21:06.794
is my daughter.

1:21:09.065 --> 1:21:11.665
See, I gave you up
when I was 16.

1:21:13.069 --> 1:21:15.703
I didn't want to.

1:21:15.738 --> 1:21:17.938
It was right before
my own sweet sixteen

1:21:17.974 --> 1:21:20.007
and my mother made me.

1:21:21.577 --> 1:21:24.879
That ballerina snow globe
that I gave you,

1:21:24.914 --> 1:21:27.481
that was the first thing

1:21:27.516 --> 1:21:30.050
that I ever bought you...

1:21:30.086 --> 1:21:32.953
and the only thing
that I had left of you

1:21:32.989 --> 1:21:36.257
until I finally found you again.

1:21:36.325 --> 1:21:38.559
But that's impossible.

1:21:38.594 --> 1:21:40.628
My husband, he had connections

1:21:40.663 --> 1:21:42.196
to the California
Birth Records Office,

1:21:42.265 --> 1:21:45.833
so I was able to find you
fairly easily.

1:21:45.868 --> 1:21:48.068
But you told me
you couldn't have kids!

1:21:48.104 --> 1:21:50.771
That's right, sweetheart.
I can't now.

1:21:50.806 --> 1:21:52.640
Right before my husband died,

1:21:52.708 --> 1:21:55.943
I found out
I have secondary infertility.

1:21:55.978 --> 1:21:57.845
So, Kerry...

1:21:59.215 --> 1:22:02.016
sweetheart, you, honey,

1:22:02.051 --> 1:22:05.552
are the only child...

1:22:05.588 --> 1:22:07.221
that I'll ever have.

1:22:07.256 --> 1:22:09.323
Lindy...

1:22:09.358 --> 1:22:12.159
she's the only child
I'll ever have, too.

1:22:12.194 --> 1:22:14.428
She's my daughter, too.

1:22:16.132 --> 1:22:19.433
You need help.
We can get you help.

1:22:19.468 --> 1:22:21.168
Let us help you, please.

1:22:21.203 --> 1:22:23.871
The only thing I need

1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:26.240
is my baby girl back.

1:22:26.342 --> 1:22:27.775
[grunts]

1:22:29.879 --> 1:22:30.878
Kayla!

1:22:32.148 --> 1:22:33.580
Charlie, are you okay?

1:22:33.616 --> 1:22:34.982
Well, uh, go.

1:22:35.051 --> 1:22:36.817
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, God.

1:22:36.852 --> 1:22:38.519
-Are you okay?
-Uh-huh.

1:22:38.587 --> 1:22:40.254
-Oh, my God.
-What?

1:22:41.190 --> 1:22:43.057
[Kerry] Is she dead?

1:22:43.092 --> 1:22:44.792
Is she dead?

1:22:45.828 --> 1:22:48.195
[Kayla] I, I think so.

1:22:49.198 --> 1:22:52.066
[instrumental music]

1:22:55.037 --> 1:22:58.138
I got some wine, great.
Isn't it amazing?

1:22:58.207 --> 1:23:00.274
Don't forget to get some food.
It's over there.

1:23:00.309 --> 1:23:02.977
Thank you so much
for coming. Yes!

1:23:04.347 --> 1:23:06.981
Fabulous, right? Yes.

1:23:07.049 --> 1:23:08.949
What an amazing turnout.

1:23:08.985 --> 1:23:10.517
-Right?
-Yeah.

1:23:10.586 --> 1:23:13.287
-Good job.
-Team work.

1:23:13.322 --> 1:23:15.322
-Hey.
-Hey, Charlie.

1:23:15.391 --> 1:23:16.857
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

1:23:16.892 --> 1:23:18.459
She's right over there.

1:23:19.829 --> 1:23:21.562
-Hey.
-Hey, you came.

1:23:21.664 --> 1:23:23.530
I did.

1:23:23.599 --> 1:23:26.567
-Is this one of yours?
-Yeah, that's mine.

1:23:26.602 --> 1:23:29.269
It only took me the rest
of the semester to finish it.

1:23:29.305 --> 1:23:33.207
-Wow, Kerry, it's gorgeous!
-Thank you.

1:23:33.275 --> 1:23:34.675
Yeah,
it's-it's really incredible.

1:23:34.710 --> 1:23:35.676
Thank you.

1:23:35.711 --> 1:23:36.910
You know, I think she does get

1:23:36.979 --> 1:23:38.245
her artistic talent from me.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:40.314
No doubt about that, mom.

1:23:40.349 --> 1:23:41.949
-Aw...
-Aw...
