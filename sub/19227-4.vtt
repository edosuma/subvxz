WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.804
Call me crazy, but I always

00:02.840 --> 00:04.328
look forward to school photos.

00:04.374 --> 00:06.341
I get to put them on the mantle,

00:06.376 --> 00:09.010
all smiling, nobody's complaining

00:09.046 --> 00:11.413
about dinner or chores
or who farted on who.

00:11.448 --> 00:13.215
But these...

00:13.250 --> 00:15.150
These...

00:17.287 --> 00:21.022
And Harley, I don't even
know where to begin with this.

00:21.058 --> 00:23.425
If I sent these to <i> abuela,</i>
she'd send them right back.

00:25.229 --> 00:26.229
What happened?

00:28.198 --> 00:31.199
When you're a Diaz kid, you're
always explaining yourself.

00:31.235 --> 00:33.468
But how do I explain this?

00:33.503 --> 00:35.270
We're gonna need popcorn.

00:35.305 --> 00:37.372
- And drinks.
- And something for your headache.

00:37.407 --> 00:39.374
- I don't have a headache.
- You will.

00:41.078 --> 00:43.211
HARLEY: <i>It all started three weeks ago.</i>

00:43.247 --> 00:45.413
My school photo look is totally natural.

00:45.449 --> 00:48.183
Only took me eight hours
to make it look that way.

00:48.218 --> 00:50.151
Eh, I slept in these clothes.

00:50.187 --> 00:52.020
You really wanna take
a good school photo?

00:52.055 --> 00:53.221
Don't try so hard.

00:53.257 --> 00:55.290
Congratulations. You nailed it.

00:55.325 --> 00:57.459
That shirt hasn't been
cool since Kesha had

00:57.494 --> 00:59.294
a dollar sign in her name.

00:59.329 --> 01:01.029
Who cares?

01:01.064 --> 01:02.430
After school, I get to do
the most awesome thing

01:02.466 --> 01:05.266
in the history of things.
Mom, don't forget.

01:05.302 --> 01:08.003
The science club is taking us
indoor skydiving.

01:08.038 --> 01:09.971
It's the most awesome thing
in the history of things.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.406
You've mentioned it once or twice.

01:11.441 --> 01:14.109
I recorded that in your sleep.

01:15.379 --> 01:19.281
She's right; I've talked about it
so much, I even annoyed myself.

01:19.316 --> 01:22.117
It's just, indoor skydiving
is like Christmas,

01:22.152 --> 01:25.453
New Year's, Fourth of July, all
wrapped up in a windy plastic tube.

01:25.489 --> 01:29.357
Yay, science! Yeah!

01:29.393 --> 01:31.393
I made a sweet countdown watch

01:31.428 --> 01:33.228
so I can mark every second
till jump time.

01:33.263 --> 01:36.031
It originally was
a countdown to summer watch,

01:36.066 --> 01:38.033
but I repurposed.

01:38.068 --> 01:40.201
Harley, I need to switch spots with you

01:40.237 --> 01:42.437
- at the next stoplight.
- Look, if Beast peed in that seat...

01:42.472 --> 01:45.040
No, I was sitting
where you are last Friday,

01:45.075 --> 01:47.042
and we all remember
what happened last Friday.

01:47.077 --> 01:48.443
Just say it. You're going to anyway.

01:48.478 --> 01:50.378
I hit my first ever free throw!

01:50.414 --> 01:52.247
Nothin' but net.

01:52.282 --> 01:54.182
Well, it rolled around
a little bit, but it went in!

01:54.217 --> 01:57.052
You're on a streak... of one.

01:57.087 --> 01:59.387
And to keep it going,
I have to do everything today

01:59.423 --> 02:01.222
exactly like I did last Friday.

02:01.258 --> 02:02.492
Talk about superstitious.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.392
More like better safe than sorry-stitious.

02:04.428 --> 02:07.095
Hey, Mom, can you turn on
that cheesy yacht rock station

02:07.130 --> 02:08.395
we yelled at you to turn off last week?

02:08.431 --> 02:11.299
- Happy to help.
- Ugh.

02:11.335 --> 02:12.434
(cheesy rock music plays)

02:12.469 --> 02:15.070
I hate this station,
but gotta keep it on.

02:15.105 --> 02:17.072
(Ethan grumbling) Why?

02:18.475 --> 02:20.308
(school bell rings)

02:21.445 --> 02:25.113
(gasps) Oh, yay, we got a substitute.

02:25.148 --> 02:26.214
Easy class day.

02:26.249 --> 02:29.184
Yes! Substitute, skydiving.

02:29.219 --> 02:32.320
Is this "international
Harley gets what she wants" day?

02:32.356 --> 02:34.055
I think it is.

02:36.093 --> 02:38.426
Oh, no. It's Detention Delorco.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.062
Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:41.098 --> 02:43.131
I don't know who that is,

02:43.166 --> 02:44.332
but I wanna be supportive.

02:44.368 --> 02:46.234
I've never had him myself,

02:46.269 --> 02:50.171
but he's legendary in my family
for giving detentions.

02:50.207 --> 02:53.208
And if I get detention today...

02:53.243 --> 02:56.010

03:49.527 --> 03:52.133
No. This is the worst day
ever to meet this guy.

03:52.169 --> 03:54.402
He has it in for the Diaz kids.

03:54.438 --> 03:56.371
Why would he have
a problem with your family?

03:56.406 --> 03:58.173
They're great.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.243
Being a Diaz means having
to answer for the mistakes

04:02.279 --> 04:04.379
of every Diaz who came before you.

04:12.255 --> 04:14.022
RACHEL: That's mine.

04:14.057 --> 04:17.091
Rachel Diaz, detention.

04:20.230 --> 04:22.197
(alarm blaring)

04:22.232 --> 04:24.365
ETHAN: That's mine.

04:24.401 --> 04:28.002
Ethan Diaz, detention.

04:28.038 --> 04:29.370
GEORGIE: So sorry, that's mine.

04:29.406 --> 04:31.272
Georgie Diaz, detention.

04:33.410 --> 04:36.110
Sometimes I wish I could
just go by one name.

04:36.146 --> 04:39.380
Just Harley, like Sia or Drake.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.150
I'm marked.

04:42.185 --> 04:44.018
Before my butt even hits the seat,

04:44.054 --> 04:46.221
Delorco will find a reason
to send it to detention.

04:46.256 --> 04:49.257
My poor butt. I wish you
went to a different school.

04:49.292 --> 04:51.292
Your butt belongs here.

04:51.328 --> 04:53.161
You're amazing.

04:53.196 --> 04:55.430
You built a backyard roller coaster.

04:55.465 --> 04:58.299
The only thing I ever built was a
healthy dislike of kale chips.

04:58.335 --> 04:59.467
I'd love to be you.

04:59.503 --> 05:02.003
That's nice of you to say,

05:02.038 --> 05:03.304
but you've never chipped your tooth

05:03.340 --> 05:04.339
fighting for a spot on the couch.

05:04.374 --> 05:07.108
But you're an A+ Diaz.

05:07.143 --> 05:09.043
A rock star.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.179
Mr. Delorco will see that.

05:11.214 --> 05:13.147
You're Harley.

05:15.185 --> 05:18.119
I'm not Rachel, Ethan, or Georgie.

05:18.154 --> 05:21.322
You're right. I am Harley.

05:26.296 --> 05:28.162
Let me guess.

05:28.198 --> 05:31.132
You must be Harley Diaz.

05:31.167 --> 05:33.434
No, that's me.

05:33.470 --> 05:35.236
I'm Harley Diaz.

05:35.272 --> 05:37.138
Of the Marshport Diazes.

05:39.109 --> 05:41.209
I so did not see that coming.

05:41.244 --> 05:45.113
Probably the same way
Delorco didn't see the door.

05:45.148 --> 05:48.049
Are we really doing this?

05:51.121 --> 05:52.353
I'm Ellie Peters.

05:52.389 --> 05:54.322
Sorry about your face.

05:56.126 --> 05:57.358
At first I was thinking
something sparkly,

05:57.394 --> 05:59.193
but that's, like, "Look at me!"

05:59.229 --> 06:01.162
Wrong. I want it to be, like...

06:01.197 --> 06:02.397
(low-key) "Look at me."

06:02.432 --> 06:04.132
Like you look, but you don't know why.

06:04.167 --> 06:06.167
9:33. Took a bathroom break.

06:06.202 --> 06:08.236
Don't have to go,
but winners make it happen.

06:08.271 --> 06:11.940
Like Taylor Swift and whoever
she's dating right now,

06:11.975 --> 06:13.141
me and this shirt are meant to be.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.176
Hmm.

06:15.211 --> 06:17.412
I think maybe your shirt
is seeing other people.

06:17.447 --> 06:20.014
Hmm?

06:20.050 --> 06:22.417
O-M-G!

06:22.452 --> 06:25.353
Riley Diamont is not
wearing the same outfit as me.

06:25.388 --> 06:28.990
I'm alphabetically right next
to her in the yearbook.

06:29.025 --> 06:32.360
I cannot be twinsies
with a girl who snort-laughs.

06:37.367 --> 06:41.002
Sloppy joes are back!

06:41.037 --> 06:42.403
Sloppy joes are back.

06:46.176 --> 06:48.343
Seven and a half dark months

06:48.378 --> 06:50.278
have finally come to an end.

06:50.313 --> 06:52.313
Banned for being too sloppy.

06:52.349 --> 06:54.315
And I fought to bring you back.

06:54.351 --> 06:57.018
This is the greatest day
in American history.

06:57.053 --> 06:58.453
You're not hearing me, Mom.

06:58.488 --> 07:00.989
It's an alpha level twinsy situation.

07:01.024 --> 07:04.959
I understand yours is also
a matter of life and death,

07:04.995 --> 07:07.028
but I'll get there when I can.

07:07.063 --> 07:08.396
(frustrated groan)

07:08.431 --> 07:10.264
That woman is so selfish.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.034
Ethan, you have to
help me find a new outfit.

07:13.069 --> 07:14.335
Borrow one from your friends.

07:14.371 --> 07:16.237
They must have
something in their lockers.

07:16.272 --> 07:18.272
Kiki's over-plaiding,

07:18.308 --> 07:21.109
and the only thing in Zia's
locker are books. Books!

07:21.144 --> 07:23.144
Everyone knows a locker
is a second closet.

07:23.179 --> 07:24.946
Go to Lost and Found.

07:24.981 --> 07:26.948
It's where I get wardrobe for my movies.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.950
Even props. You read
my script about the yo-yo.

07:28.985 --> 07:31.119
I don't want anyone to see me
rifling through someone's

07:31.154 --> 07:34.122
scuzzy old clothes. That's a loser move.

07:34.157 --> 07:35.223
You do it.

07:35.258 --> 07:38.126
I would love to help,

07:38.161 --> 07:41.262
but I've got a date
with a sandwich named Joe.

07:41.297 --> 07:43.064
Do you?

07:43.099 --> 07:45.266
It would be a real shame
if someone called the school

07:45.301 --> 07:46.968
with a food fight scare,

07:47.003 --> 07:48.202
and bounced Joe from today's menu.

07:48.238 --> 07:50.204
- Food fight?
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.206
That's how it was banned the last time.

07:52.242 --> 07:53.408
History can't repeat itself.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.213
Hey, Miles, remember last Friday,

07:59.249 --> 08:01.983
you laughed at the toilet paper
dragging from my shoe?

08:02.018 --> 08:04.018
- Not really.
- Well, you did.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.353
Yuck it up.

08:07.390 --> 08:10.358
The quadratic formula.

08:10.393 --> 08:12.260
I don't know what I was thinking.

08:12.295 --> 08:14.228
I was trying to protect you, and
it just popped out of my mouth.

08:14.264 --> 08:16.397
"I'm Harley Diaz."

08:16.433 --> 08:19.000
Terrifying, but I did
like the sound of it.

08:19.035 --> 08:20.334
Well, like the sound of it quieter.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.304
If Delorco finds out,
it's bye-bye, skydiving,

08:23.339 --> 08:25.139
hello, detention.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.208
Forget freefall.
I won't be free until fall.

08:27.243 --> 08:29.377
Oh, I'm too soft for detention.

08:29.412 --> 08:31.145
It's a tough crowd.

08:31.181 --> 08:33.246
The gelled-back hair,
the leather jackets.

08:33.283 --> 08:36.217
Okay, you gotta stop watching <i> Grease.</i>

08:36.251 --> 08:38.285
No one's gonna get detention.
We got this.

08:42.258 --> 08:43.424
Oh, Mr. Delorco.

08:43.460 --> 08:46.327
Could I have an important
word with my sister?

08:46.362 --> 08:48.029
We're in the middle of class.

08:48.064 --> 08:49.964
It's a matter of life and death.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.999
I need to find out
what I had for lunch last week.

08:52.035 --> 08:54.068
Say good-bye, Ms. Diaz.

08:55.105 --> 08:56.170
Bye, sis.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.909
Nice touch, but that was close.

09:01.945 --> 09:05.046
We got lucky. Georgie doesn't
usually give up that easily.

09:05.081 --> 09:07.148
GEORGIE: Harley.

09:07.183 --> 09:09.050
Why are you saying my name?

09:09.085 --> 09:11.219
- I'm not.
- Harley.

09:11.254 --> 09:13.387
Harley. Harley!

09:15.024 --> 09:18.259
- Hey, Harley.
- Stop calling me that. Go away.

09:18.294 --> 09:20.394
I just army-crawled
through three pieces of gum,

09:20.430 --> 09:22.997
and what I'm hoping
was ketchup to get here.

09:23.032 --> 09:24.298
Now tell me what I had
for lunch last week.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.167
I'm Harley; maybe I can help.

09:26.202 --> 09:28.035
- Why is she Harley?
- Because I'm Ellie.

09:28.071 --> 09:29.237
What?!

09:30.306 --> 09:32.306
That's right, I'm Ellie,

09:32.342 --> 09:34.108
she's Harley.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.944
Harley who loves rewarding
her non-blabby friends

09:36.980 --> 09:38.580
with a free slushy
from her Slushy Shack.

09:41.050 --> 09:43.017
Diaz, detention.

09:46.389 --> 09:48.289
And the next time I see you
crawling around my classroom,

09:48.324 --> 09:50.358
it better be fire safety week.

09:52.195 --> 09:55.096
Hey, I got detention last Friday, too.

09:55.131 --> 09:58.166
It happened around 1:47,
but I'll take it now.

09:58.201 --> 09:59.433
Thanks, Mr. D.

09:59.469 --> 10:01.068
There's the door.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.375
What kind of sicko
threatens a food fight

10:07.410 --> 10:10.278
the day a sandwich
makes its glorious comeback?

10:10.313 --> 10:12.313
The kind who's so desperate,
she might wearing something

10:12.348 --> 10:14.282
from a box that has a moldy pizza in it.

10:14.317 --> 10:17.051
Looky, looky. We have a winner.

10:19.155 --> 10:20.388
Ugh.

10:20.423 --> 10:24.158
Everybody likes cats. Am I right?

10:24.194 --> 10:27.061
If the person who wore that
goes to this school,

10:27.096 --> 10:29.163
I need to transfer.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.134
I can't believe we made it out of there.

10:33.169 --> 10:35.036
My heart is racing.

10:35.071 --> 10:37.205
Probably won't beat this fast
during skydiving.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.473
I'll be happy if mine
never beats this fast again.

10:39.509 --> 10:41.275
I feel like I've
been juggling lightning.

10:41.311 --> 10:44.212
You did good. I couldn't have
been a better me myself.

10:49.152 --> 10:51.319
It's Delorco. Quick, other way.

10:55.525 --> 10:58.025
Oh, no.

10:58.061 --> 11:00.521
Our mom is here.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.269
Harley, hurry up.
We're waiting to hear the rest.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.573
Seriously. You leave at the most
tense moment of the entire story

11:11.643 --> 11:12.932
to get more popcorn?

11:12.959 --> 11:15.711
That's what good storytellers do.

11:15.837 --> 11:17.747
They make you wait for it.

11:17.772 --> 11:19.939
- So where were we?
- Delorco on one side,

11:19.975 --> 11:22.775
and Mom on the other.
World's lamest showdown.

11:22.811 --> 11:24.911
Your story is about digging
through the Lost and Found,

11:24.946 --> 11:27.880
so maybe lose the attitude.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.850
This portion's about me,
so I wouldn't mind hearing it.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.686
Hi. Mr. Delorco.

11:35.711 --> 11:36.990
Always a pleasure.

11:37.025 --> 11:40.093
I just came by to give
this to my daughter.

11:40.555 --> 11:43.423
- Oh! That's for Harley.
- Yes, thank you.

11:45.074 --> 11:48.901
Oh, I almost forgot.
Harley, could you get that...

11:50.171 --> 11:52.205
Harley, could you get that...

11:55.110 --> 11:56.309
...to Rachel?

11:56.344 --> 11:58.211
You bet. Thanks, Mom.

12:00.281 --> 12:04.117
I gave blood earlier, so
my head's still a little swimmy.

12:04.152 --> 12:06.119
Maybe I should have one of these.

12:06.154 --> 12:08.020
To stop the wooziness.

12:08.056 --> 12:09.956
They said, "Take as many as you want,"

12:09.991 --> 12:13.226
but I just took these and
the six other boxes in my car.

12:13.261 --> 12:15.194
To stop the wooziness. I'm gonna go.

12:16.965 --> 12:21.033
Kinda filled in the blanks
for me on the Diaz family.

12:21.069 --> 12:23.903
Ditto that, Mr. D...

12:23.938 --> 12:26.139
...lorco. That's a lovely tie.

12:31.246 --> 12:34.013
Hey, Chet, I need you to
think long and hard,

12:34.048 --> 12:36.149
because I have
a very important question.

12:36.184 --> 12:38.184
What did you serve
for lunch last Friday?

12:38.219 --> 12:41.254
Fish and chips, absolutely sure.
I'd bet my life on it.

12:41.289 --> 12:43.890
Oh, because for a minute, I was thinking

12:43.925 --> 12:45.091
- it was meatball subs.
- Right. That was it.

12:45.126 --> 12:47.193
Great. Give me one of those.

12:47.228 --> 12:49.162
Uh, today's Sloppy joes.

12:49.197 --> 12:51.164
That weird floppy-haired kid
with the petition

12:51.199 --> 12:52.298
finally got what he wanted.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.134
Sloppy joes, meatball's messy cousin.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.970
Meat, bun. Oh, we've got
the building blocks here.

12:58.006 --> 13:00.106
Would you mind balling up some meat,

13:00.141 --> 13:01.908
plopping it onto a bun,

13:01.943 --> 13:03.776
and kind of smooshing the bun
into a longer shape?

13:03.812 --> 13:08.114
Yeah. I've been warned
about squeezing the food.

13:08.149 --> 13:09.949
Can't do it.

13:09.984 --> 13:12.018
I'm under a lot of pressure here,

13:12.053 --> 13:13.853
trying to create a winning streak,

13:13.888 --> 13:15.188
so I'm not moving till I get something

13:15.223 --> 13:17.156
that resembles a meatball sub.

13:17.192 --> 13:20.126
I've ridden a lot of benches,
Chet, I know how to wait.

13:24.232 --> 13:27.133
(sighs) This day's been an
emotional roller coaster.

13:27.168 --> 13:28.801
At least, that's what I've heard.

13:28.837 --> 13:31.237
My mom only lets me
ride the merry-go-round.

13:31.272 --> 13:34.807
This day's been
an emotional merry-go-round.

13:34.843 --> 13:36.242
(clock chiming)

13:36.277 --> 13:40.213
Only two more hours,
and I'm flying high.

13:40.248 --> 13:43.115
Ain't no stoppin'
Harley/Ellie/whoever I am now!

13:44.853 --> 13:46.919
(painful groaning)

13:46.955 --> 13:48.154
What was that?

13:48.189 --> 13:50.857
I'll be taking over for Miss Parsons

13:50.892 --> 13:53.159
until her nose stops bleeding.

13:53.194 --> 13:55.895
I hope young Ellie Peters
has learned a valuable lesson

13:55.930 --> 13:58.898
about doors, and how they open.

13:58.933 --> 14:01.067
Not that I'm agreeing
with him or anything,

14:01.102 --> 14:02.869
but really, Harley, how
hard is it to open a door?

14:02.904 --> 14:05.905
Look, we've already done this once.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.140
We just have to keep a low
profile, and we're golden.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.879
Ellie Peters.

14:12.914 --> 14:14.814
Ellie Peters!

14:14.849 --> 14:16.849
That's you, golden girl.

14:16.885 --> 14:18.050
Yep. That's me.

14:18.086 --> 14:20.887
According to Miss Parsons' lesson plan,

14:20.922 --> 14:24.056
you're giving your
biology presentation today.

14:24.092 --> 14:26.225
Yes, of course.

14:26.261 --> 14:28.194
Remind me what it is again.

14:28.229 --> 14:32.198
Bird calls. The sweet song of nature.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.267
Bird calls? Really?

14:34.302 --> 14:36.002
This isn't my fault.

14:36.037 --> 14:38.004
I invited you to birdcall camp.

14:39.874 --> 14:41.107
It's true, she did.

14:41.142 --> 14:42.909
But knowing what I know now,

14:42.944 --> 14:44.944
I still probably wouldn't have gone.

14:48.116 --> 14:50.082
Here's your Frankensub.
Now get out of here,

14:50.118 --> 14:52.184
- or I'll get written up again.
- Absolutely.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.954
But first, do you remember
where I sat last Friday?

14:54.989 --> 14:56.889
Look, all I remember about last Friday

14:56.925 --> 14:59.025
is that some idiot
spilled a meatball sub,

14:59.060 --> 15:00.060
and I had to clean it up.

15:00.094 --> 15:02.094
Got it all over me.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.897
Heads up, don't go to a dog
park with meatball sub pants,

15:04.933 --> 15:06.999
unless you wanna leave
with just a waistband.

15:07.035 --> 15:09.235
Wait. I was that idiot
who spilled their sub.

15:09.270 --> 15:11.203
I humiliated myself.

15:11.239 --> 15:13.039
Oh, I could totally do that again.

15:13.074 --> 15:15.141
I have every reason
to believe that's true.

15:17.211 --> 15:21.047
Okay, one, two, three,
trip, spill on myself,

15:21.082 --> 15:23.916
or one, two, three,
spill on myself, trip?

15:23.952 --> 15:25.251
Guess I'll have to
find it in the moment.

15:25.286 --> 15:27.186
One, two...

15:27.221 --> 15:29.922
All suited up and ready for a joe-down.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:39.033 --> 15:43.970
Yes. Trip then spill.
That's how I did it.

15:44.005 --> 15:46.872
I am so sorry. I'll go get some napkins.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.941
And maybe change if
you're going to a dog park.

15:48.977 --> 15:51.043
I wish with all my heart

15:51.079 --> 15:53.179
you'd taken that joe bib
when I offered it.

15:53.214 --> 15:55.214
Gross!

15:55.249 --> 15:56.949
Hey, who threw that at me?

15:56.985 --> 15:59.051
Sorry. Accidental flick.

15:59.087 --> 16:00.886
Everyone, calm down.

16:00.922 --> 16:02.788
Food fight!

16:05.159 --> 16:08.127
As you know, I am Ellie Peters,

16:08.162 --> 16:10.129
whose friend Harley will give a slushy

16:10.164 --> 16:14.767
and a soft pretzel to anyone who enjoys
this presentation without comment.

16:14.802 --> 16:18.137
We have a fascinating
20-minute film on mitochondria

16:18.172 --> 16:21.207
to get to. Let's hear
your bird calls, Ms. Peters.

16:21.242 --> 16:23.242
Ah, yes. Bird calls.

16:23.277 --> 16:25.845
The calls that come from birds.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.047
Our winged friends
from the great blue yonder.

16:28.082 --> 16:30.082
In five seconds, I start
the film and you get a D.

16:30.118 --> 16:32.818
Seagull, seagull.

16:32.854 --> 16:34.220
Crow, crow.

16:34.255 --> 16:37.189
Uh, card... inal.

16:37.225 --> 16:39.925
Uh... cardinal!

16:39.961 --> 16:42.962
I find it hard to believe
that those are actual birdcalls.

16:48.531 --> 16:49.594
Hey.

16:49.618 --> 16:52.367
That's a pigeon;
I'm only giving you half credit.

16:53.074 --> 16:55.074
And you owe me a tuna sandwich.

16:56.244 --> 16:58.177
That's half more than I deserve.

16:58.212 --> 16:59.945
(phone rings)

17:01.816 --> 17:03.916
- DELORCO: Yes?
- I thought you did super.

17:03.951 --> 17:07.053
Wow. You are a really good friend.

17:07.088 --> 17:09.888
Cardinal? Come on.

17:09.924 --> 17:11.190
Diaz, that was the office.

17:11.224 --> 17:13.992
You're late for Friday announcements.

17:14.028 --> 17:17.829
Great. On it. I'm all about it.

17:17.865 --> 17:19.231
I have to do Friday announcements?

17:19.267 --> 17:22.134
I can't speak to the entire school.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.730
You have to. If you don't...

17:28.041 --> 17:29.809
Detention.

17:36.463 --> 17:38.230
Being a Diaz is too much pressure.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.499
It's scary and stomach churny.

17:40.534 --> 17:42.400
You can do this,

17:42.436 --> 17:44.536
because today, you're Harley,

17:44.571 --> 17:48.240
and someone once told me
she's an A+ Diaz.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.276
- A rock star.
- She is.

17:52.513 --> 17:54.212
Let's go, Diaz.

17:54.248 --> 17:56.328
Or are you waiting for
a bird to call you down there?

18:02.523 --> 18:06.502
Seven and a half months I campaigned
to get that sandwich back.

18:06.527 --> 18:08.979
I even tried rebranding it
the tasty joe,

18:09.004 --> 18:10.758
to highlight its better qualities.

18:10.783 --> 18:13.898
People are already lining up for photos.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.768
I'm just gonna have to suck it
up and wear my original shirt.

18:18.905 --> 18:20.939
Where is it?

18:20.974 --> 18:23.474
I think I found it.

18:25.679 --> 18:27.812
She's rockin' it.

18:27.848 --> 18:29.480
I can't believe it's come to this.

18:29.516 --> 18:30.849
Come to what?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.905
(kids meowing)

18:41.930 --> 18:44.462
- Hey, cool shirt.
- Really?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.998
No. I just told somebody
that last Friday.

18:47.023 --> 18:48.500
Day repeated.

18:48.535 --> 18:50.568
Man, sports are exhausting.

18:53.279 --> 18:55.179
I'm Harley Diaz.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.409
<i>I'm Harley Diaz. Really cool girl,</i>

18:58.445 --> 19:00.712
excellent person. I can do anything.

19:00.747 --> 19:02.714
(feedback whines)

19:04.518 --> 19:07.519
(clears throat, feedback whines)

19:07.554 --> 19:08.620
<i>Good day, Marshport Terriers.</i>

19:08.655 --> 19:10.555
In breaking news,

19:10.590 --> 19:13.525
<i>today's basketball game
has been canceled</i>

19:13.560 --> 19:15.426
<i>due to a food fight in
the school multi-purpose room.</i>

19:15.462 --> 19:16.795
No!!

19:16.830 --> 19:19.464
<i>As a reminder,
the school bus will be leaving</i>

19:19.499 --> 19:21.566
<i>after school for a field trip</i>

19:21.601 --> 19:23.635
<i>to the Wind Beneath My Wings
Skydiving Institute.</i>

19:23.670 --> 19:25.804
<i>Hey, my best friend
Harley's doing that...</i>

19:25.839 --> 19:28.506
I mean, I'm doing that.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.775
I'm Harley. Ask anybody.

19:30.811 --> 19:33.444
Please don't.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.712
(coughing over P.A.)

19:34.748 --> 19:37.649
Let's just skip right to
the word of the day.

19:39.886 --> 19:42.387
Oh, no, I forgot.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.772
Today's word is the longest
word in the dictionary.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.575
Took me a whole week
to learn how to pronounce it.

19:47.611 --> 19:49.811
Ellie's going to black out
just looking at it.

19:53.783 --> 19:57.852
<i>Pneumonoul...</i>

19:57.888 --> 20:01.823
<i>tramicroscopic...</i>

20:01.858 --> 20:04.392
<i>silico...</i>

20:04.427 --> 20:07.662
both: volcanoconiosis!

20:07.697 --> 20:11.666
Yes. She did it! Yes, yes!

20:11.701 --> 20:13.601
What?

20:13.637 --> 20:15.670
Ellie Peters really
loves the word of the day.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.473
(whispers) Yes.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.774
I did it.

20:19.809 --> 20:23.478
I am Harley Diaz.

20:27.717 --> 20:29.884
<i>I am...</i>

20:29.920 --> 20:31.653
<i>Harley Diaz.</i>

20:42.599 --> 20:43.865
Way to go, Harley.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.633
Back atcha, Harley.

20:47.671 --> 20:49.537
Harley Diaz, you're up.

20:52.909 --> 20:54.709
Harley Diaz, you're up.

20:55.745 --> 20:57.645
Harley Diaz?

20:57.681 --> 20:58.681
You're up.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.551
Harley Diaz!

21:06.790 --> 21:08.756
(bell rings)

21:08.792 --> 21:11.526
Well, we did it. Let's promise
to never do this again.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.561
You can count on it.

21:13.597 --> 21:15.496
I've learned my lesson about
being brave and spontaneous.

21:15.532 --> 21:17.632
There's the Ellie I know and love.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.636
Oh, poor Ethan.

21:26.443 --> 21:28.543
Who threw that?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.548
That would be me.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.750
Harley Diaz.

21:35.785 --> 21:37.418
Detention.

21:37.454 --> 21:38.486
No, wait...

21:38.521 --> 21:39.554
I'm Harley Diaz.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.623
Ellie, I can't just let...

21:41.658 --> 21:44.559
Yes, you can. That's what friends do.

21:49.047 --> 21:50.413
(watch chiming)

21:50.438 --> 21:52.467
Hey, Mr. Delorco.

21:55.672 --> 21:57.472
You don't know Diaz.

22:04.681 --> 22:08.650
Sorry, watch. Not happening.

22:08.685 --> 22:10.685
<i>It's easy to focus on the negative.</i>

22:10.720 --> 22:12.787
<i>To take being a Diaz for granted.</i>

22:16.626 --> 22:17.626
What are you two in for?

22:17.661 --> 22:18.661
BOTH: Food fight.

22:18.695 --> 22:20.561
<i>But every now and then,</i>

22:20.597 --> 22:22.664
<i>it takes an honorary Diaz to remind you</i>

22:22.699 --> 22:24.666
<i>how special it really is.</i>

22:33.810 --> 22:36.678
Well, I guess that answers
all my questions.

22:36.713 --> 22:37.879
Except for one.

22:37.914 --> 22:40.481
What's gonna happen when Ellie's mother

22:40.517 --> 22:42.617
opens her pictures?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.520
(doorbell rings)

22:45.555 --> 22:47.522
Everyone hide!

22:48.522 --> 22:53.522
