(female narrator)
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.770 --> 00:06.466
- Why are you following me?
- Should I take these off?

00:06.500 --> 00:09.503
- Spencer, hi. I'm Yvonne.
- Hi.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.531
Toby's told me
so much about you.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.538
(Hanna)
I erased the security footage
from the hotel

00:13.580 --> 00:15.229
the night
Charlotte was murdered.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.168
The security company we use
backs up all of our tapes.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.507
If the police get a hold
of that drive

00:18.550 --> 00:20.677
they'll see that Aria left
the hotel and they'll know

00:20.720 --> 00:22.244
that you're the one
who erased the footage.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.484
You're protecting a friend.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.284
One of the many things
I love about you.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.289
Wow, that was fast. If you're
really not okay with this--

00:29.330 --> 00:32.424
No, that was just
a knee-jerk reaction. It's fine.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.122
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm donating my eggs.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.718
Do we really think
that's a murder weapon?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.624
(Aria)
I think my dad
might have had something

00:38.670 --> 00:40.160
to do with Charlotte's murder.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.360
He swore that if
Charlotte ever got out

00:41.400 --> 00:43.129
he would do whatever
it takes to protect me.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.404
[instrumental music]

00:54.320 --> 00:56.049
[cell phone beeps]

01:04.490 --> 01:05.684
Did I scare you?

01:05.730 --> 01:07.493
Why are you sitting in the dark?

01:07.530 --> 01:10.192
I, uh, I have something
to tell you.

01:15.270 --> 01:19.730
I guess you have been able
to put things together.

01:19.780 --> 01:25.446
Enough to know that I have been
hiding something from you.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.349
I have to confess that I've..

01:30.390 --> 01:32.278
...I've been seeing someone.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.158
Wh.. Wait, what?

01:38.260 --> 01:41.855
Mom, hey, how long
have you known about this?

01:41.900 --> 01:46.496
Umm, well...since he asked me.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.908
[cell phone beeps]

01:50.940 --> 01:52.339
(Aria)
'Umm..'

01:53.910 --> 01:55.775
Wow.

01:55.810 --> 01:58.472
[chuckles]
Congratulations.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.273
I'm so glad
we finally told you.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.346
Now we don't have
to sneak around anymore.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.642
That's why I saw you
at The Radley.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.353
- Oh! You saw me?
- I-I did. Yeah.

02:09.390 --> 02:13.292
I guess I just thought
it was for some other reason.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.627
With you being back in town

02:14.660 --> 02:17.891
we needed to find
some place to talk.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.899
About when _to tell
you and Mike.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.464
Should we call him again?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.705
No, let's just give him
a chance to call us back first.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.402
_ Seems like he's never
In hIS dorm room anymore.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.674
You are okay with this, right?

02:30.710 --> 02:32.143
Yeah.

02:40.820 --> 02:45.689
* Got a secret can you keep it
swear this one you'll save *

02:45.730 --> 02:50.724
* Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave *

02:50.770 --> 02:55.696
* IfI show you then I know
you won't tell what I said *

02:55.740 --> 03:00.677
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead **

03:06.320 --> 03:08.572
[sighs]
You're making a lot of noise

03:08.620 --> 03:10.417
and _none of it
sounds like an omelet.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.714
The car will be here in five.
We overslept.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.512
Well, maybe we should
have went to bed earlier.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.688
What fun is a sleepover
if we actually sleep?

03:17.730 --> 03:18.685
[cell phone beeps]

03:18.730 --> 03:20.698
We can stop somewhere
on the way for coffee.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.267
Umm, I might need to go
up a little later.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.608
I have to make some calls.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.631
Isn't Claudia's charity
trunk show tonight?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.501
I thought you said
you're going back for that.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.269
That's why I brought
a car back down here

03:35.310 --> 03:36.447
so we could spend
more time together

03:36.480 --> 03:37.777
and then drive back
into the city.

03:37.810 --> 03:41.519
I know I sound
like a whinging sook, but..

03:42.720 --> 03:44.347
...I miss you.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.254
I just have to be
near a landline.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.554
You know the cell service
on the turnpike.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.659
I have a ton_ of stuff
to confirm.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.565
Her hair, her makeup,
her nail tech

03:57.600 --> 04:00.933
her masseuse, her trainer,
her astrologer, I mean..

04:00.970 --> 04:03.530
What am I forgetting?
Oh, her therapist.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.435
Is it really worth
all this grunt work?

04:05.470 --> 04:08.303
Johnny Wujek wasn't always
styling Katy Perry.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.841
Everybody starts
in the trenches.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.939
And my trench is Claudia.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.948
I'll work one year with her

04:13.980 --> 04:15.777
five years as creative director

04:15.820 --> 04:17.048
and then hello, Katy.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.308
But I'm gonna do that in three.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.553
I'm sorry. I keep changing
things last minute.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.683
I'll just see you tonight.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.698
Your tie.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.664
I don't even care.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.544
[clears throat]
Sorry. I'm a little bit early.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.798
It's just my mom
is driving me nuts.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.318
Uh, girl stuff.
Your car's probably here.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.749
I'll leave you
to your secrets then.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.848
Bye.

04:55.090 --> 04:57.729
Be careful.
I could get used to this.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.621
Honestly, ahem,
I just wanted to, uh

05:01.660 --> 05:03.821
make sure you were fully awake.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.758
For what?

05:05.800 --> 05:09.338
I think that we need to go to
the cops with these new texts.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.601
I'm awake.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.029
I mean if we really are back
at square one with A--

05:16.080 --> 05:17.479
Mnh-mnh.

05:17.510 --> 05:20.411
We don't know for sure
that this is an A.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.509
I don't know. That trash can
full of black hoodies?

05:22.550 --> 05:25.815
It felt like somebody was saying
all the rules are changed.

05:25.850 --> 05:28.717
And all we know for sure
is this A isn't Charlotte.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.959
They could be
anybody, anywhere..

05:33.000 --> 05:34.752
...hiding in plain sight.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.760
As in Sara Harvey?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.495
I mean, do you really think
that it's her

05:39.540 --> 05:42.464
hiding behind
all those evil emojis?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.569
I don't know.
She can't really type that well.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.771
Maybe a picture's
easier for her to send.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.448
I'm starving.
Do we have anything?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.414
Yeah, I got a little something.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.941
- You want a refill?
- Yes, please.

05:56.550 --> 05:57.949
Hey, what about Ezra?

05:57.990 --> 05:59.651
Couldn't he clear this up?

05:59.690 --> 06:01.681
Has anybody heard from him?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.051
Well, my guess
is that he left town

06:03.090 --> 06:04.819
to avoid telling us
what he knows.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.454
I mean, I'm not even saying we
need to build an airtight case.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.025
- We could just go to Toby.
- No.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.732
Caleb, he's finally happy.

06:12.770 --> 06:15.637
He's moved on. I really don't
wanna throw this in his path.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.001
At least not _until
we have something more

06:17.040 --> 06:19.429
than a few snarky emojis
from an unlisted number

06:19.480 --> 06:21.607
and a photo
of an alleged murder weapon.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.505
I guess you're right.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.438
I mean, we're talking
about Aria's dad.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.119
You know it's like if he did
this, he did it to protect her.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.414
If we were to get
this golf club

06:30.450 --> 06:32.088
Sara couldn't hold it
over our heads.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.054
And then we really could
go to the cops about her.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.489
[watch beeps]

06:36.690 --> 06:39.557
It's, it's a calendar alert.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.421
Have lunch with Gil.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.620
I really don't remember
scheduling that.

06:44.670 --> 06:48.060
Oh, my God. This election
is totally eating up my brain.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.000
Oh, my God,
I have endless e-mails

06:50.040 --> 06:52.702
and then I've that strategy
session this afternoon

06:52.740 --> 06:55.777
and I have to make
those campaign calls.

06:55.810 --> 06:57.107
Yeah, I've been
pretty distracted

06:57.150 --> 06:59.106
the last few days too.

06:59.150 --> 07:02.847
I might be slightly distracted.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.879
Hmm.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.051
Is this distracting you?

07:11.090 --> 07:13.593
Mmm, no.

07:15.030 --> 07:18.022
You know, I can probably
just get a few e-mails done

07:18.070 --> 07:19.196
if you wanna continue.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.561
Yeah.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.507
How about this?

07:30.650 --> 07:33.016
That's slightly
more distracting.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.118
So what'd you tell Pam?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.857
Uh, you know you can never call
my mom that to her face, right?

07:43.890 --> 07:45.824
I told her we were still_
narrowmg down bridesmaids'

07:45.860 --> 07:47.828
dresses, even though
you haven't asked us yet.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.589
I mean, you're gonna
ask us, right?

07:49.630 --> 07:51.495
You've a lot more to worry
about than that.

07:51.530 --> 07:52.792
You need me to drive you?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.262
'No, it's okay.
The clinic has a service.‘

07:54.300 --> 07:55.836
They just wanna make sure
there's someone to help me

07:55.870 --> 07:57.508
get me settled in the bed after.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.838
I mean, I should be fine
in a day or so.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.849
Well, I'll mash up your Jell-O
just the way you like it.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.911
Em, you seem nervous.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.838
Hey, these are your eggs.
You can change you mind.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.211
That's not it. I'm just..

08:12.250 --> 08:13.979
I'm weirded out by that text.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.248
From Aria?

08:15.290 --> 08:16.848
Okay, this may sound
crazy cynical

08:16.890 --> 08:19.029
but if Byron and Ella
do get remarried

08:19.060 --> 08:20.857
doesn't that mean she wouldn't
have to testify against him?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.788
I mean, I'm not saying
that Byron's guilty.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.718
Did I miss the memo that says
we call people's parents

08:24.770 --> 08:26.738
by their first names now?

08:26.770 --> 08:30.308
It's just like "Downton Abbey"
where Bates goes on trial--

08:30.340 --> 08:34.208
Hanna, I'm talking
about the text from Ali.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.038
- Didn't you..
- No.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.002
Oh, she's back.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.018
And of course,
she reaches out to me alone

08:41.050 --> 08:42.938
and just assumes
I'll come and hear her out.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.787
I'm not doing it.
I mean I can't.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.788
Keeping this secret from my mom
has been hard enough.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.708
And yesterday
I took this gigantor shot

08:48.760 --> 08:50.284
and I feel like I've had
three too many macchiatos.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.888
I mean, why does she do this,
why does she always come

08:51.930 --> 08:53.124
_ to me ﬁrst
and just expect that--

08:53.160 --> 08:54.991
Okay, are you gonna breathe

08:55.030 --> 08:56.793
or just keep talking
until you pass out?

08:56.830 --> 08:59.321
Sorry, it's the hormones.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.793
Just tell her you're busy.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.967
Oh, I don't know
why I didn't think of that.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.739
[cell phone beeps]
Hormones.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.909
Okay, well, can you keep them
in check for ten minutes?

09:07.940 --> 09:09.999
This is work.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.268
- Morning, Claudia.
- I'm out of gum.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.777
Charity is so stressful.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.617
You know I like to chew
when I'm stressed.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.288
Yeah, I put a whole case
in your desk.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.208
Uh, peppermint, not wintergreen.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.911
Wet nails. I'll smudge.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.053
Ask your manicurist to look in
the bottom left drawer.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.955
- Do you need anything else?
- 'Yes.‘

09:24.990 --> 09:27.151
Umm, call Wilhelmina
'cause I wanna switch out

09:27.200 --> 09:28.792
all the models for tonight.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.718
Tell them I want Asians.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.762
Only Asians.
Very into Asians.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.597
They're incredibly chic.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.632
(Ezra on phone)
'This is Ezra.
Leave me a message.‘

09:38.670 --> 09:40.774
[automated message]
'Voice mailbox full.'

09:43.750 --> 09:47.277
- Did I interrupt?
- Oh, it's, it's nothing.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.242
[sighs]
What's up?

09:49.280 --> 09:51.987
We sprang some pretty
big news on you last night

09:52.020 --> 09:56.719
and I got the sense that maybe
you're not as happy as we are.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.753
I-I just did not
see it coming...at all.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.995
I know your surprised face.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.726
It's very different
than your concerned face.

10:05.770 --> 10:08.762
If you have concerns,
I wish you'd share them.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.200
I guess it was just
all the...sneaking around.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.676
I-I just had it in my head that
something else was going on.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.007
Like what?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.268
Well, I've been thinking
all sorts of things

10:17.310 --> 10:18.948
since Charlotte was killed.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.278
I guess we haven't really
talked about that a lot.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.788
'Did your father and I
give you too much space?‘

10:25.020 --> 10:28.319
Maybe. I didn't even
see you guys at the hearing.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.682
To be honest, neither
one of us would have stood

10:31.730 --> 10:34.096
in support of her release.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.997
We didn't want our opinion
to influence your statement.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.861
You needed to tell the truth.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.367
What about later that night?

10:40.400 --> 10:43.699
We assumed you wanted to process
things with your friends.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.833
- So..
- What?

10:45.870 --> 10:48.771
We took advantage of the fact
that you were with your friends

10:48.810 --> 10:50.744
and your father
was at my apartment.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.044
Wait, you two were..

10:53.080 --> 10:55.275
You were together
the whole night?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.039
I'm...not the kind of mom

10:58.090 --> 11:00.058
who wants to share
those details.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.308
I checked in with you
the next day.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.056
What are you asking me?

11:05.090 --> 11:07.854
Forget it. I..

11:07.900 --> 11:11.666
I-I'm just realizing
that this is a good thing.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.065
It's a really,
really good thing.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.737
Oh, hi.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.429
I didn't know
you were coming by.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.038
IfI ask you a question

11:23.080 --> 11:25.446
are you gonna promise
not to lie to me?

11:25.480 --> 11:28.779
- Hanna, I'm running late.
- Why'd you do it, mom?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.412
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:30.450 --> 11:32.179
Yes, you do.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.916
'The exact drive with the exact
footage of the hotel'

11:34.960 --> 11:37.281
the night Charlotte was
murdered, it's now missing?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.422
I don't buy it.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.927
From what I understand

11:39.960 --> 11:41.291
the police are still
looking for that.

11:41.330 --> 11:44.367
Are you really gonna
make me accuse you?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.027
I'd prefer you didn't

11:46.070 --> 11:48.288
especially when I had
nothing to do with it.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.434
So the fact that it went missing
the day I told you what I did

11:51.470 --> 11:54.177
that's just a coincidence?

11:54.210 --> 11:56.075
I suppose it is.

12:04.120 --> 12:08.910
Hanna, the police haven't come
knocking with a warrant.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.349
The only person who suspects
that backup drive

12:11.390 --> 12:13.893
is in this house is you.

12:13.930 --> 12:17.422
Mom, just tell me where it is.
I'll get rid of it.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.166
Hanna, the drive is gone.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.132
Gone? Did you--

12:21.170 --> 12:24.833
Just be grateful
your mistake has been erased.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.768
Don't think about this,
think about..

12:29.810 --> 12:32.244
...wedding cakes
and flowers and..

12:32.280 --> 12:33.975
Fine.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.079
I won't bring it up again.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.759
[dramatic music]

13:03.210 --> 13:04.279
[car lock beeps]

13:06.980 --> 13:08.845
[car engine starts]

13:16.360 --> 13:17.281
* Oh oh oh oh oh

13:19.860 --> 13:24.263
* Tell me I'm the one you need
I'll make you set me free *

13:24.300 --> 13:29.237
* I'm ready ready to go
oh oh oh oh *

13:30.910 --> 13:33.378
* Gotta get up
gotta keep running *

13:35.210 --> 13:38.304
* Never gonna stop
just give me your loving **

13:38.350 --> 13:41.171
Who knew your mother had that
whole stash of sample products?

13:41.220 --> 13:43.211
It's like
she's hoarding moisturizer.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.343
Yet another thing
she's good at hiding.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.327
Okay, did I just let
Sara Harvey trick me

13:50.360 --> 13:52.897
into trashing every room
in my mother's house?

13:54.030 --> 13:56.157
What if your mom's
telling the truth?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.088
What if she actually
destroyed the drive?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.267
Sara wouldn't have asked for it

13:59.300 --> 14:01.029
unless she really thought
it was here.

14:01.070 --> 14:03.334
And if I don't hand it over,
she's gonna crash my wedding.

14:03.370 --> 14:04.462
Wait.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.434
We really think this is
Sara Harvey sending these texts?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.038
Who else would it be?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.344
Well, if she leaves the hotel
to pick up the drive

14:11.380 --> 14:14.042
I can get in there
and I can grab that golf club..

14:14.080 --> 14:16.071
...befor_e she tries
to take a swmg at one of us.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.179
We don't have the drive.

14:18.220 --> 14:21.053
But she thinks
we have the drive.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.354
So we give it to her.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.881
- Dr. Rollins?
- 'Elliott, please.‘

14:25.930 --> 14:30.924
I apologize for the intrusion,
but I was hoping we could, uh..

14:30.970 --> 14:33.996
She sent you, didn't she?
Alison?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.337
You didn't answer her messages.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.338
- It's kind of intentional.
- Please.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.361
She doesn't know I've come
to you. I'm just trying to help.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.435
I can't see her right now.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.904
She wants to apologize.
Her behavior was alienating.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.942
She shouldn't be alone
right now. Just come by.

14:47.980 --> 14:50.517
_ For what? _
A pizza and a mowe?

14:50.550 --> 14:53.087
No, thank you.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.054
Ithought
it wouldn't hurt to try.

15:00.630 --> 15:05.090
[clears throat]
This was a bad time
to ask a favor of you.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.939
- If you need anything--
- I need you to leave now.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.232
Please.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.074
(Spencer)
Umm, are you sure, Gil?

15:16.110 --> 15:19.238
It wasn't rescheduled
for another day?

15:19.280 --> 15:22.272
Oh, really, you don't have it
in your calendar at all.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.015
Okay, umm..

15:24.050 --> 15:26.348
- That-that's fine. Umm, I'll--
- 'Spencer.‘

15:26.390 --> 15:27.948
Okay, I'll-I'll call you
right back.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.617
Hey, Yvonne.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.321
I'm so sorry.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.396
Uh, whoever updated
my calendar didn't, uh,

15:33.430 --> 15:35.318
include your contact info,
so I wasn't--

15:35.360 --> 15:37.726
Couldn't call me to tell me
that you're late for our lunch?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.739
Exactly. Though I guess I could
have called the restaurant.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.729
Yeah, umm, so, so somebody else
updates your calendar for you?

15:44.770 --> 15:48.479
Uh, yeah. There's a campaign
aide in charge of coordinating.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.740
That's probably
who you talked to, to schedule.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.271
Yeah. Umm, yes, I did. Yeah.

15:53.320 --> 15:58.087
_You know I have to admit I
didn't expect you to reach out.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.587
Uh, the town hall
was such a success

15:59.620 --> 16:03.226
but I guess I just assumed
we'd retreat to our own corners.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.683
Umm, well, you know,
I really wanted to pick

16:05.730 --> 16:07.357
your brain if that's okay.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.459
Uh, this whole
daughter-of-the-candidate thing

16:09.500 --> 16:10.694
it's so new to me and so--

16:10.730 --> 16:12.425
- Of course.
- You know..

16:12.470 --> 16:14.631
Umm, inside or out?

16:14.670 --> 16:16.092
Uh, inside's great.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.607
Do you mind
if I just make one quick call?

16:17.640 --> 16:19.505
- And then I'll be right in.
- Of course, I'll get a table.

16:19.540 --> 16:20.734
Okay, thanks.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.478
Uh, Caleb, Yvonne just showed up
to my lunch with Gil.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.341
Uh, did he arrange it?
Some sort of campaign thing?

16:32.390 --> 16:35.279
No, he's not here and she thinks
that I invited her.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.289
Ten bucks says Evil Emoji
is trying to stir the pot.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.389
And she probably hacked
both of your phones.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.022
- Can you get out of there?
- No.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.199
You know what,
I think I'm gonna stay.

16:44.230 --> 16:47.097
Maybe she can help me
figure out who scheduled this.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.096
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.334
I wouldn't have made the effort

16:50.370 --> 16:52.759
if I'd known how much
it would upset Emily.

16:52.810 --> 16:55.472
I tried to reach
the others, but..

16:55.510 --> 16:57.501
Good morning, Haley.
That was a great essay.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.608
Thank you.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.049
Let it go.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.342
I mean, I've done enough
to force them away.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.814
I don't wanna force them
to take my apology too.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.489
You may have made it difficult
for your friends to support you

17:06.520 --> 17:10.229
but that doesn't change the fact
that you still need them.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.820
How long has it been since
your father made an effort?

17:12.860 --> 17:14.498
Or Jason?

17:14.530 --> 17:16.293
You're right.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.389
My friends are the closest thing
I have to family now.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.265
You've been my rock.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.803
I have more vacation days.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.104
I can take them
if you need me to.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.631
I appreciate that, but..

17:29.680 --> 17:31.238
...I'm home.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.248
Time to get back to work.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.816
Back to normal.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.169
Or at least try.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.085
[bell rings]

17:40.320 --> 17:42.515
I have work to catch up on
and they want me to start

17:42.560 --> 17:45.154
taking over my classes
tomorrow, so..

17:47.260 --> 17:49.751
- Then I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.098
Thank you for trying.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.133
And we both know
politics is not an honest game.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.774
You have to get used
to the idea that there is no

18:02.810 --> 18:05.301
expectation of privacy.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.647
You're always being watched.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.240
So how did you learn
to trust the people

18:09.280 --> 18:12.317
who work for your campaign?

18:12.350 --> 18:15.478
My mom ran for the school board
when I was eight.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.125
I've grown up with the idea
that you can't trust

18:18.160 --> 18:19.457
everyone with everything.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.219
Hmm.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.797
I'm guessing
trust is hard for you

18:23.830 --> 18:25.764
given what you and your friends
went through.

18:25.800 --> 18:30.635
Yeah, I mean, y-yeah, people
know what we went through.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.228
That's inevitable.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.635
I wasn't out in the world
for very long

18:33.680 --> 18:37.844
before I realized that
my entire sense of people was..

18:37.880 --> 18:42.214
...warped and I had to pound
myself into a normal shape.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.343
Cut clear a..

18:44.390 --> 18:46.711
Had to cut off bad habits
with a blowtorch.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.389
And I had to weld on new ones
wherever they would fit.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.924
There's nothing wrong with
being an Iron Lady, Spencer.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.689
In fact,
they're my favorite kind.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.266
- Thank you.
- Umm, you know what--

18:58.300 --> 19:01.292
Uh-uh, I insist.
Really.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.262
Uh, next one is on me then.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.505
I will hold you to it.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.599
- I gotta run.
- Okay.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.549
Thank you again. Bye.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.189
[intense music]

19:37.670 --> 19:39.399
Thank you.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.776
[intense music]

19:54.890 --> 19:56.881
Sara.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.921
'Can I help you?'

19:57.960 --> 20:00.520
I didn't realize
you worked here.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.290
- 'I'm looking for Room 19.‘
- In the East Wing.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.237
Across the courtyard
on the left.

20:09.270 --> 20:10.931
I knew you worked here.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.336
I don't know why I lied.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.679
My physical therapist
connected me to a teacher.

20:16.710 --> 20:20.976
I'm supposed to give a talk
on...living with a disability.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.989
- But..
- But what?

20:24.020 --> 20:26.318
Why are you here?

20:28.820 --> 20:30.788
After the accident..

20:30.830 --> 20:33.799
...when my hands
were still numb and bandaged

20:33.830 --> 20:36.355
I spent months having to be fed.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.267
I hated...every spoonful

20:39.300 --> 20:41.894
from...every nurse's aide.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.408
I'm not sure
why I need to know this.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.534
Because I mistreated every
person who tried to help me.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.933
But they kept on helping.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.574
'And now I have to do that
for someone else.‘

20:52.910 --> 20:57.415
I guess I, I just wanna say
I'm sorry, Alison..

20:57.450 --> 20:59.941
...for your loss..

20:59.990 --> 21:02.709
...and for lying to the judge
about Charlotte.

21:02.760 --> 21:06.059
You burned her at the stake
on that witness stand

21:06.090 --> 21:07.398
and you walked.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.648
I was scared

21:09.700 --> 21:12.567
_ and I said whatever
it took to protect myself.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.393
I shouldn't have..

21:18.110 --> 21:19.805
...but I did.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.535
I feel terrible about it

21:21.580 --> 21:23.946
and everything
that's happened to her since.

21:23.980 --> 21:27.848
We both...know what it meant
to be close with Charlotte.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.048
I felt like we were sisters.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.513
She used you to replace me.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.882
When no one else was there
for her, I was.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.852
That wasn't my choice.

21:41.130 --> 21:43.519
I didn't reject her.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.822
I didn't lock her up.

21:45.870 --> 21:49.328
And I spent the past five years
making up for lost time

21:49.370 --> 21:51.031
getting to know her.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.436
We never really knew
all of her.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.601
But I was hoping..

21:57.650 --> 21:59.800
...maybe you and I can
put our pieces together

21:59.850 --> 22:02.819
and...understand things
a little better?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.742
I want something good
to come from all of this.

for the real drive.‘

22:46.930 --> 22:48.852
I'm glad you came to me.

22:50.060 --> 22:52.164
You know you can
always come to me.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.464
Yeah, I know.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.593
[door opens]

22:57.870 --> 22:59.030
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.675
Spencer, sorry, uh,
1-1 was just leaving.

23:01.710 --> 23:04.599
No, there's no need
to rush off. I'm..

23:04.650 --> 23:06.003
Actually, I'm really glad
that both of you guys

23:06.050 --> 23:07.449
are here right now.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.913
- What's up?
-Umm"

23:08.950 --> 23:11.942
I did something
not entirely out of character

23:11.990 --> 23:13.514
but just out of practice.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.687
What's going on, Spencer?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.426
Toby's fiancee kind of left this

23:17.460 --> 23:19.678
and I kinda sort of didn't
give it back right away.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.698
Y-you know this is a good thing.

23:21.730 --> 23:24.824
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

23:26.130 --> 23:29.099
I can use it to try to find out
who's sending these texts.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.903
Or at least
get a little bit closer.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.066
I was hoping you'd say that.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.737
[cell phone rings]

23:33.780 --> 23:35.702
[sighs]
I don't know
who's more needy today.

23:35.740 --> 23:37.549
Sara Harvey
and this freaking hard drive

23:37.580 --> 23:39.002
or my boss and her gum.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.574
I have to take this.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.019
I'll look at both phones.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.041
Maybe with two hacks,
I can follow the trails

23:44.090 --> 23:45.443
back to a common source.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.684
How long do you think
it will take?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.187
Uh, I'll clone
Yvonne's cell phone.

23:48.220 --> 23:50.450
I mean, she'll have it back
before she knows it's gone.

23:50.490 --> 23:52.629
No, Claudia, I can't leave.

23:52.660 --> 23:55.220
Yes, I'll handle it
over the phone.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.696
Yeah, I promise. I can get you
another four feet of catwalk.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.499
[sighs]
You guys, I've gotta go.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.735
- Later.
- Bye, Hanna.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.483
Ali.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.010
I know you don't wanna see me.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.722
- I was just gonna leave.
- Well, is something wrong?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.782
Come in.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.490
1..
Something happened.

24:30.530 --> 24:31.758
It's really strange.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.633
Sara Harvey,
she came to see me.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.004
I think Sara and Charlotte
might have been closer

24:38.040 --> 24:39.701
than we thought.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.571
I think Sara
actually cared about her.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.044
Why would you believe
a word she says?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.742
Can I just stay here for a bit?

24:46.780 --> 24:48.839
I could really use
someone to talk to.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.587
I can't stay. I actually
have somewhere to be.

24:52.850 --> 24:54.112
Oh!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.809
[sighs]
Great!

24:56.620 --> 24:58.986
Elliott told you?

24:59.030 --> 25:02.022
Yeah, well, they're my eggs
and I made the decision

25:02.060 --> 25:03.721
so I need to do it.

25:03.770 --> 25:04.828
You can say
whatever you wanna say.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.861
I don't care.
Just..

25:06.900 --> 25:10.609
[sighs]
...promise me
you won't tell my mom.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.904
Emily, Elliott didn't.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.172
Honestly, I had no idea.

You're donating your eggs?

Oh, my God!

I'm such a jerk.

Umm, today.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.782
And you're going by yourself?

25:34.730 --> 25:36.721
No, Han, I-I booked online.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.728
I didn't wanna run into your mom
and have her ask questions.

_ - Excuse me.
- Hi, can I get you a table?

26:05.290 --> 26:07.793
Uh, no. I found this outside.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.752
Uh, I was wondering
if you had a lost-and-found?

26:09.800 --> 26:13.167
Thank goodness. I've been
looking for that everywhere.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.371
(Mona)
I'll just tell Yvonne
the restaurant found this.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.139
- I'll keep you out of it.
- Why?

26:23.180 --> 26:25.045
I wouldn't want people to think
you stole somebody's phone.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.139
Somebody whose mother
is running against your mother.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.718
- That would be awkward.
- Did you set this all up?

26:30.750 --> 26:33.810
- Set all what up?
- Me and Yvonne, this lunch.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.816

leaving her phone.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.820
That isn't exactly explosive,

26:43.870 --> 26:47.829
And this isn't exactly the race
for a senior class president.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.395
We don't do those kinds
of things anymore.

to wait here with me.

I'm gonna leave you here alone.

I'll be right here
when you wake up.

What are you gonna do
after this?

I'm gonna use the money
to finish school.

to work, so I booked a room.

I could expense it.

- Sara Harvey.

nobody's in there.

into a place since my dorm room.

And those keys cost
like a $100 to replace.

And I don't really know
what you think I'm capable of.

Yeah, but I'm thinking
we get in there another way.

on the balcony.

Oh, my God! You're not serious.

You, you're tall.
You've got long legs.

you over first like a Frisbee?

are we supposed to do?

can you come back over here

and worn flats.

- That's it.
- Alright.

She was trying
to take out her IV.

32:32.510 --> 32:36.071
Some patients have a rough time
coming out of anesthesia.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.985
Honestly, I feel a lot better.

32:38.020 --> 32:41.217
Good, because I need
to have a conversation

32:41.260 --> 32:44.718
about something that happened
during the procedure.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.728

Alright.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.466
Well, there's been
an unforeseen development.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.637
This has to do with the couple

32:55.670 --> 32:58.059
who had planned on
using your eggs.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.066
They decided to back out.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.335
Oh!

33:02.380 --> 33:05.201
It's good news.
They're pregnant.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.445
They found out earlier today.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.175
But it means
they won't need your eggs

33:09.220 --> 33:11.245
which we've already retrieved.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.712
You have a decision to make.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.354
Can she keep them?

33:14.390 --> 33:16.551
They can be frozen
for later use

33:16.590 --> 33:20.549
but there are costs
associated with that choice.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.524
They can also be destroyed.

33:23.530 --> 33:24.792
No.

33:24.830 --> 33:27.424
If it's possible,
can I donate them somewhere?

33:27.470 --> 33:30.132
I mean, I, I still feel like
I wanna help someone

33:30.170 --> 33:31.501
start a family if I can.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.701
Well, we work with a few
egg banks across the state

33:33.740 --> 33:35.674
that accept donations.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.769
I'll get the paperwork started.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.182
it's in that box
with the rest of your things.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.824
You can just take that and go.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.658
Hand. Hand.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.419
Give me..

34:29.460 --> 34:31.121
Give me your hand!

34:32.300 --> 34:34.188
Steam this for me,
will you, honey?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.437
Hey, you can't talk to people
like that, Claudia.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.677
Hanna,dean

34:42.710 --> 34:44.644
You're really stressing me out.

34:44.680 --> 34:48.138
Why don't we end things
on a high note, okay?

34:48.180 --> 34:51.479
Um, on your way out,
you can get me some gum.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.681
Get your own damn gum, Claudia.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.314
- There's a pack in your desk.
- Excuse me?

34:56.360 --> 34:59.158
Two in your briefcase,
two in your purse

34:59.190 --> 35:01.499
and a whole stash
in your bedside table.

35:01.530 --> 35:05.227
I do everything you ask me
to do and then some.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.625
And all you do,
you just pick me apart

35:07.670 --> 35:10.594
and you send me on a thousand
different, ridiculous errands!

35:10.640 --> 35:12.699
Weren't you the girl
that came marching in here

35:12.740 --> 35:13.832
with a five-year plan?

35:13.870 --> 35:15.371
Well, if you leave now

35:15.410 --> 35:17.674
you're gonna be starting
over again at the bottom.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.348
Apologize

35:19.380 --> 35:22.247
and maybe I'll consider
keeping you on..

35:22.280 --> 35:23.770
. ..as second assistant.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.380
Is that the best you've got?

35:26.420 --> 35:28.513
If you're trying
to scare me into staying..

35:29.690 --> 35:31.521
...you're gonna
have to do way better.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.791
There's a line of girls
just waiting to take your place.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.355
Fine, let them.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.333
I've been pushed around by
a lot worse than you.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.374
If she's refusing maid service,
shouldn't this..

35:53.410 --> 35:55.241
...place have been
a little bit messier?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.872
It doesn't even look like
she's slept here.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.285
Yeah, that
or she's learned how to make

35:58.320 --> 36:00.413
hospital corners
with her teeth.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.752
Spence.

36:04.390 --> 36:06.779
You know what, umm,
this was a really bad idea.

36:06.830 --> 36:08.889
I think that we should just go
back out the way that we came.

36:08.930 --> 36:11.569
Yeah, you're right. Let's go.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.562
[sighs]

36:20.610 --> 36:22.669
There's no one here.

36:23.810 --> 36:25.641
Okay, that's creepy.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.978
Well, put it back or
she's gonna know we were here.

36:28.010 --> 36:29.443
She'll just blame it
on housekeeping.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.243
Do you wanna get someone fired?

36:32.250 --> 36:33.786
Come on,
let's find that golf club.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.280
[dramatic music]

37:05.750 --> 37:08.685
[music continues]

37:36.350 --> 37:38.386
- Do you feel anything?
- No.

37:38.420 --> 37:40.809
Where else could she
be hiding a golf club?

37:40.850 --> 37:42.056
[cell phone beeps]

37:42.090 --> 37:43.387
I'm gonna go look in the closet.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.479
Okay, I'll finish up in here.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.392
Wow! I could live in here.

37:51.430 --> 37:54.263
This thing is seriously bigger
than my apartment.

37:55.770 --> 37:58.705
[dramatic music]

38:27.970 --> 38:30.393
You stood up for yourself.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.000
She's gonna blackball me.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.975
[sighs]
I should have apologized.

38:36.010 --> 38:38.399
I should have begged
for my job back.

38:40.810 --> 38:42.016
I left my panda bear mug.

38:42.050 --> 38:46.339
That magazine has relationships
with dozens of designers.

38:46.390 --> 38:47.539
I bet if I make a few calls

38:47.590 --> 38:49.683
you'll have ten interviews
by Monday.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.520
Well, you should call
"The Times" first.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.494
Our wedding announcement
cannot say

38:55.530 --> 38:58.397
Jordan Hobart,
junior VP of Ad Sales

38:58.430 --> 39:00.398
marries Hanna Marin, unemployed.

39:00.430 --> 39:02.136
Alright. That's enough.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.434
I'm not gonna let you spin out.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.734
Cuddle up. Come on.

39:08.910 --> 39:10.571
I really don't care
what the announcement

39:10.610 --> 39:13.374
in "The Times" says. Okay?

39:15.050 --> 39:17.518
And what if it said

39:17.550 --> 39:21.145
Hanna Marin,
luckiest girl alive

39:21.190 --> 39:23.681
marries her genuine
prince charming?

39:25.160 --> 39:26.855
What do you wanna do?

39:26.890 --> 39:29.120
You wanna go right
to our place?

39:29.160 --> 39:31.663
Or maybe stop somewhere
for a drink?

39:32.970 --> 39:34.562
No.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.637
Do you wanna...get
out of the city for a few days?

39:37.670 --> 39:39.729
Go back to Rosewood?
You can clear your head?

39:42.710 --> 39:44.803
I don't wanna go to Rosewood..

39:45.880 --> 39:47.541
...or the apartment.

39:48.650 --> 39:50.675
Can we just keep driving?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.847
'Whatever you want, love.'

40:06.600 --> 40:08.761
(Spencer)
'Aria.‘

40:08.800 --> 40:10.859
'Aria, you have to come
look at this.‘

40:10.900 --> 40:13.733
Sara's staying here because
this was Charlotte's old room

40:13.770 --> 40:16.807
when she was a patient
at Radley.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.501
Aria!

40:21.750 --> 40:23.411
Aria?

40:25.890 --> 40:28.017
[dramatic music]

40:44.940 --> 40:46.737
Aria?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.774
[knock on door]

40:51.810 --> 40:52.947
Hanna?

40:52.980 --> 40:54.641
[knock on door]

40:56.050 --> 40:57.938
Hanna, did you forget your key?

40:57.980 --> 40:59.516
[knock on door]

41:00.290 --> 41:01.882
Hang on a sec.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.997
[dramatic music]

41:37.090 --> 41:39.684
I don't know who you are
or what kind of game

41:39.730 --> 41:42.597
you think you're playing,
but guess what?

41:42.630 --> 41:46.259
If you can change the rules,
so can we.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.598
[automated message]
'Goodbye.‘

41:48.640 --> 41:50.130
[evil laughter]

41:50.170 --> 41:51.831
[laptop beeps]

42:11.160 --> 42:14.129
[theme music]
