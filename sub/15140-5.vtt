00:00.125 --> 00:01.960
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.044 --> 00:05.130
[man] Mr. Speaker,
the president of the United States!

00:05.255 --> 00:07.799
[Rod] A country full
of people who believe in you.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.010
I want you to be my chief of staff.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.679
- Rod, stay in your lane.
- If I've got an idea...

00:12.804 --> 00:15.015
You're the one that
has her ear at bedside.

00:15.098 --> 00:18.018
Are you guys allowed to have
guests over, to the White House?

00:18.101 --> 00:19.311
I can do whatever I want.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.146
Well, I'm... free tonight.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.484
Man, if I was your age
I'd be crawling out of my skin.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.529
I love this stuff. Guess it's
'cause I'm pretty mature.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.989
I have to be able to do my job.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.534
Part of it is knowing
when to keep her from the press.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.536
I'm gonna run for president.
I have to.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.664
I want you to resign.
I want you to be my vice president.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.000
We can save this country.
We can save it from her.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.711
What a town. You can't even
trust the backstabbers.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.674
[Rod] Put it on, Amy.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.175
No.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.928
We had a deal, Princess Orion.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.098
You want to wear that costume,
you gotta throw the coat over it.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.224
But I'm not cold.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.726
- It's October.
- But I'm hot.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.395
Come on. We're gonna be late.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.814
There you go.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.316
- I'm already hot.
- I know. I know.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.695
Yeah. She's a bird, she's a plane,

01:09.820 --> 01:11.405
she's off to Pierce Elementary,

01:11.488 --> 01:14.408
- All right, have fun at school, kids.
- Bye, Dad.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.077
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye! See ya!

01:18.579 --> 01:20.163
Ah!

01:20.247 --> 01:21.248
Missed it.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.499
Everything OK?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.875
- Yeah, fine.
- You?

01:24.001 --> 01:27.337
Yeah. I'm about to introduce
our new national security advisor.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.463
Mm.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.967
I was wondering if you would like
to sit in. I think Anthony would...

01:32.050 --> 01:34.970
Oh, you remember? I'm gonna
go see, uh, Ken. In Baltimore.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.556
- The World Series.
- Should be a good game.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.642
- Wanna go?
- Yeah. I'll just blow this off.

01:40.726 --> 01:44.354
You realize this will be
my first night here without you?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.898
Mm, just do what you normally do.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.943
- Fall dead asleep?
- Mm-hm.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.654
Maybe we could work
on that when you get back.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.074
Sounds like a plan. So...

01:56.199 --> 01:58.410
- ...see you tomorrow, kiddo.
- Mm.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.078
Have fun.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.580
[Melanie] I hate the new guy.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.248
You've known him two minutes.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.543
That is long enough to know
that he is an unqualified kiss-ass.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.546
You're right. Deputy director
for Latin America at State,

02:09.630 --> 02:12.132
ambassador to Venezuela,
led the DOD Policy Board.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.635
What was she thinking?
They go way back to school.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.244
They're bosom buddies, and I have to
answer to him? I'm not the only one...

02:18.419 --> 02:21.600
Justice and Homeland only answer
to Prado on domestic terrorism.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.312
The president wants one point person
on security issues. Give her a break.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.318
Hey, Kelly.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.113
Hey. Anything special I should know?

02:35.197 --> 02:38.158
No, just the announcement.
You know the press agenda.

02:38.241 --> 02:42.120
First Latino in the job, fluent in six
languages, worked with the president.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.622
Great. See you in there.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.125
[Mac] Please join me in welcoming
our new national security advisor,

02:47.209 --> 02:49.336
Anthony Prado.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.300
Thank you. Thank you.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.844
Thank you, Madam President,
for your kind words.

02:57.928 --> 03:02.557
I promise to serve you honorably and
always provide my most honest judgment.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.351
I know. And that's what worries me.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.644
Madam President,

03:05.727 --> 03:10.315
isn't it true Mr. Prado recommended you
for your first job out of law school?

03:10.399 --> 03:13.443
[Mac] More like, uh, sold me
into indentured servitude.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.487
That firm worked me 100 hours a week.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.490
Now, it's... payback time.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.910
Mr. Prado, do you think
you'll approach your job differently

03:21.993 --> 03:23.745
because of your Latino background?

03:23.829 --> 03:25.163
[Prado] That's hard to say,

03:25.247 --> 03:28.041
as I've never approached
a job from a white background.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.836
- [laughter]
- Touché. Let me rephrase the question.

03:30.919 --> 03:35.257
Sorry. No more questions.
The president has a meeting now.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.050
Thank you for coming, everyone.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.510
[man] Thank you, ma'am.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.179
[cameras clicking]

03:41.263 --> 03:43.598
[chatter over TV]

03:48.061 --> 03:49.020
What's going on?

03:49.104 --> 03:52.566
U.S. Border Patrol picked up a guy
trying to cross the Canadian border

03:52.649 --> 03:54.693
early this morning. He had explosives.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.572
He's being transferred to FBI now.
We need to prepare for a real threat.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.366
The subject, real name is Tariq Azam,

04:01.450 --> 04:04.911
was picked up three hours ago
crossing the border at Windsor, Ontario,

04:04.995 --> 04:08.248
using a false U.S. Passport,
alias, Douglas Salib.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.208
His real nationality, Saudi Arabia.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.210
Somehow Azam evaded our watch lists...

04:12.294 --> 04:15.756
Melanie, let Prado lead.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.717
Sorry. Not used to the new system.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.929
What we know so far is that Azam
is an al-Muharib operative.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.599
Trained at the Shahid camp in Lebanon.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.895
Al-Muharib always plans simultaneous
attacks and always thematically linked.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.230
How many targets
have we identified exactly?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.441
[Prado] Unfortunately, only one. Azam's.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.068
His attack was scheduled
for tomorrow, Halloween,

04:37.152 --> 04:39.070
- at 1:00.
- Where?

04:39.154 --> 04:43.825
The Alexander Hamilton Elementary
School in Springfield, Missouri.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.453
TATP explosives were hidden
in the passenger seat.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.872
Two timing devices
concealed in a spare tire

04:48.955 --> 04:52.125
along with blueprints
of the Hamilton School.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.795
- How many students there?
- Three hundred and sixty,

04:54.878 --> 04:55.921
ages five to 12.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
If we're assuming
a multiple point attack,

05:02.219 --> 05:05.514
projected casualties could be
anywhere from 600 to 1,000 dead.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.813
Our biggest priority right now
is to track down the rest of this cell.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.273
We have no intercepts
on Azam from Intelligence.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.317
Also, an active al-Muharib cell

05:17.400 --> 05:20.737
always halts all communications
at least ten days before an attack.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.616
[Melanie] If we don't locate Azam's
co-conspirators before 11am tomorrow

05:24.699 --> 05:26.827
others bombs will go off
as no doubt planned.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.953
More schools.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.831
If children are the targets,
it could be parks, malls.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.791
I recommend we raise the terror alert.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.169
We do that, we tip off Azam's
co-conspirators that he's in custody.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.589
That's our only advantage. I don't
want anything leaked to the press

05:39.673 --> 05:42.467
about this threat until
the rest of the cell is in custody.

05:42.551 --> 05:46.304
[Jim] The last thing we need is for them
to speed up or alter their targets.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.931
Who knows about the threat?

05:48.014 --> 05:51.977
Templeton and Remarque are briefing
the Intelligence Committee shortly.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.647
We also had to inform the local
police and the mayor of Springfield.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.859
- All advised not to talk to the press.
- I'll fill Kelly in.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.695
Ma'am, it is fairly clear
that the only way we are gonna

06:01.778 --> 06:05.490
find Azam's co-conspirators
before tomorrow morning is if he talks.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.201
- What are the chances?
- Everybody talks eventually.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.203
The question is will it be soon enough.

06:27.387 --> 06:31.308
[Jimmy Kimmel on laptop] The president
had to delay her vacation to Camp David

06:31.391 --> 06:34.060
when husband Rod, and this is sad,

06:34.144 --> 06:37.939
pricked his finger trimming
the White House rose garden.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.734
Wait. What'd he say? Make it louder.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.402
[applause on TV]

06:42.527 --> 06:44.362
What's up? Series highlights?

06:44.446 --> 06:46.573
I saw in the news today
that President Allen

06:46.698 --> 06:49.576
may give her husband,
Rod, a new Cabinet post.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.454
He will be secretary
of making her breakfast.

06:53.455 --> 06:57.083
- I hope your parents don't watch this.
- They've stopped.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.753
- Really? And why is that?
- Because it's not funny.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.881
They made your daddy
the secretary of making breakfast.

07:03.006 --> 07:06.051
Hey, whoa, man. I thought
you had a sense of humor.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.595
- You gonna take this?
- It's just stupid jokes.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.932
- But they're about your dad.
- [boy] Is that why you acting weird?

07:12.057 --> 07:13.558
Because your dad's a big wuss?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.101
All right. Come on, let it go.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.770
Being a wuss runs in the family.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.106
- [woman] Hey! Hey! Hey! Knock it off!
- [man] Cut it out!

07:20.190 --> 07:22.817
- Knock it!
- Break it up!

07:51.680 --> 07:54.891
[man] You've probably got some idea
why we invited ourselves over.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.019
Well, it's not totally
out of left field.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.939
We didn't expect
Congressman Reinhold to retire.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.274
We'd thought he'd stick
around another term.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.777
- I know Reinhold did too.
- Yeah.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.822
Mm. Would you like
something to eat? Please.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.615
- Yeah.
- Sure.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.784
That's an amazing wife you got there.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.453
She spends her days
putting murderers away,

08:15.578 --> 08:18.289
and then she comes home
and whips up a mean cheese spread.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.374
[laughing] Yeah.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.795
Of course she's following the brilliant
example set by our attorney general.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.715
Mm-hm, I learned
everything I know from him,

08:26.798 --> 08:28.550
as a prosecutor and a chef.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.844
[laughter]

08:30.927 --> 08:33.013
You said that you came about Reinhold?

08:33.138 --> 08:37.684
Right. If Mike Zamore wins Reinhold's
seat, that would be a disaster.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.519
He's got the state party's backing.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.396
More reason to think outside the box.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.189
Excuse me one minute.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.399
Where you going?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.234
I have to put the twins to bed.

08:46.359 --> 08:50.405
- You're the one we came to see.
- We want you to run for Congress.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.585
I am a student.
I was studying engineering.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.587
[man] That how you
learned to make bombs?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.881
[Azam] I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.216
You don't have a sister in Green Bay.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.969
Do you have any other family
in the United States?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.763
No. No, I don't.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.268
I've done over 200 interrogations.
This guy's not breaking any time soon.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.230
The Shahid camp in Bekáa Valley,
Azam trained there.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.774
Maybe there's a paper trail.

09:25.857 --> 09:30.278
We've got our best interrogators on
their way. Should land in half an hour.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.864
- What's the status of the camp?
- In a CIA overwatch.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.034
They've been monitoring it
since 2002. Yields a lot of intel.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.286
- Ma'am, if I may...
- Let's raid the camp.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.289
We've got a team
on the ground in Jordan. Black ops.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.918
Overnight. Bust down the doors
and pull out whatever we can find.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.254
Justice already has this threat covered.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.884
A covert operation
like this is expensive,

09:52.967 --> 09:54.427
risky, and it could cost lives.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.596
[Prado] The president's plan
makes sense.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.432
Its likely Azam
met his conspirators in training.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.602
- What's the one thing we know?
- They keep the best records.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.774
So we're just giving up on Azam?

10:07.857 --> 10:12.070
We have 25 hours until bombs start
going off, and we have no idea where.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.655
Keep up the interrogation,

10:13.738 --> 10:17.492
but I am not trusting the safety of our
children to what happens in that room.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.501
[Templeton] I'm at a loss, Melanie.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.796
What's she doing?
Has MI-5 gotten into the mix?

10:29.879 --> 10:33.800
As far as they were concerned, he's an
engineering student and a devout Muslim.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.927
The bomb-making materials they found,

10:36.010 --> 10:37.971
is that enough for...
What's his name?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.681
Azam.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.850
To classify him as an enemy combatant?

10:41.933 --> 10:45.270
- Not this president, I promise that.
- Bloody hell.

10:45.353 --> 10:49.149
Don't forget you're scheduled to be
on Gordon Blake's talk show tomorrow.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.817
And we're in a crisis.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.154
The public's gonna expect you
to be swaddled in the American flag.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.905
Swaddled, no.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.493
I'm gonna very humbly say that the
president is doing everything she can

11:00.577 --> 11:03.454
to avert this terror threat.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.331
Now you tell me, Melanie...

11:06.207 --> 11:08.668
...will I be I be lying if I say that?

11:09.878 --> 11:10.879
I'll talk to her.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.881
Good girl. Go do it.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.473
It would be unseemly.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.019
I cannot be seen
to be critical of the president

11:26.102 --> 11:29.063
when all of this is unfolding.

11:29.147 --> 11:32.692
But you be ready to book
a couple of shows next week

11:32.775 --> 11:35.820
because if one bomb goes off tomorrow,

11:35.904 --> 11:38.907
I am gonna put this all
on her shoulders.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.287
The Bekáa Valley
is technically part of Lebanon.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.582
- If they find out that our guys...
- We have to make sure they don't.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.000
Ma'am.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.420
Kids at Hamilton Elementary
won't be going to school tomorrow.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.297
The mayor of Springfield got scared.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.966
He notified the principal
who notified the parents.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.343
Let's contain it.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.429
Too late. AP picked
the story up and got a quote

12:01.512 --> 12:04.307
from the mayor confirming
that it's terrorist-related.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.934
He tipped off Azam's cohorts.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.353
He wasn't told why
we were keeping this covert.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.023
It should be enough the FBI
told him to keep his mouth shut.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.026
Look, I have a dozen reporters
hounding me for details.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.945
Keep it under wraps that we have Azam.

12:17.028 --> 12:21.199
Don't mention al-Muharib. Don't bring up
other cell members, additional targets.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.244
We handle this correctly,
we can convince the collaborators

12:24.327 --> 12:26.788
we don't know they're out there
and avoid a panic.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.206
All right. Thanks.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.834
OK. Jim, call Prado and see if we can
move up the launch from Jordan.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.046
I wanna know what the risks
are if we go in before nightfall.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.008
Our 25-hour window
may slam shut any second.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.178
There's a possible threat
of loss of life.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.305
Why weren't we informed
about the threat?

12:44.389 --> 12:48.142
The government doesn't share every
aspect of homeland security measures.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.187
Could the government tell us
how they learned of the threat?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.148
Was it routine intelligence?
An individual in custody?

12:54.232 --> 12:56.317
For security reasons, I can't answer...

12:56.401 --> 12:58.236
Come on, Kelly,
you gotta be kidding.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.530
The most important thing
is that now we know

13:00.613 --> 13:03.908
we've taken every possible measure
to avert the existing threat.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.745
What about the New York Stock
Exchange, Lambeau Field?

13:07.829 --> 13:09.914
There is only one known target.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.917
Can the White House confirm
the safety of these locations?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.669
That's a loaded question.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.171
Does that mean that
the threat has been resolved?

13:17.255 --> 13:18.923
At this point we don't know

13:19.007 --> 13:22.093
if it's an isolated target
or part of a larger plot.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.763
[woman] Terrorists groups have never
before tried to attack a red state.

13:25.847 --> 13:29.100
What does this means? Moving away
from only targeting blue states.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.854
It mean we should stop thinking of
ourselves as red states and blue states

13:32.937 --> 13:35.606
and start thinking
of ourselves as the United States.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.609
[Ken] One guess why
I asked you to make the trip up.

13:38.693 --> 13:42.155
Uh... not for the pleasure
of my company? [laughs]

13:42.238 --> 13:45.491
Uh, you want Mac to toss out
the first ball the next opening day.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.120
Not even close. Frank Hanford's
contract is up in December.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.789
We've got a short list of ten.
You're at the top of it.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.542
We want you to be the next
commissioner of baseball.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.128
Your legal background,
leadership experience...

13:57.211 --> 13:58.838
Washington connections.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.551
Sure. Those entered the discussion.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.720
But the truth is
the league needs you, Rod.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.805
We're about legitimacy and integrity.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.891
Here's your chance
to make it to the bigs.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.394
To make an impact
on the game that you love.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.314
You can't tell me you don't want to.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.649
- I have obligations.
- Of course.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.194
To the president, to my kids.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.489
No first person has ever worked
outside the White House.

14:25.448 --> 14:29.077
Did Mary Todd Lincoln
ever have this good an offer?

14:30.286 --> 14:31.371
Think about it.

14:34.749 --> 14:38.002
If you could keep me updated on
any new intelligence that comes...

14:38.086 --> 14:40.505
- [yelling] Princess Orion!
- Excuse me.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.507
Amy. Mommy is on the phone.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.550
What did we say about that?

14:44.634 --> 14:46.094
I... forgot.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.099
I'm sorry. Again, we are
keeping this internal for now.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
- Sorry, Mommy.
- It's OK.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.063
Vince. [groans]

14:57.146 --> 14:58.314
Yes, ma'am?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.401
Would you escort
Princess Orion back to her galaxy?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.403
Of course I will.

15:03.486 --> 15:07.240
Ready, Amy? One, two, three!

15:09.951 --> 15:12.370
Operation Orion begins in 45 minutes.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.747
- When should we have news?
- A couple hours.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.875
Homeland Security recommends
that we raise the terror alert.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.544
At least until after Halloween.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.380
When the story hit the wires,
schools began shutting.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.216
If we don't do anything,
we risk looking unresponsive.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.884
How many schools have shut down?

15:26.968 --> 15:30.054
About 40 percent of elementary,
30 percent of middle, upper.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.433
We don't have a number on how many
parents are keeping their kids home.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.892
Teachers calling in sick.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.894
- Azam talking?
- Still stonewalling.

15:36.978 --> 15:41.441
Why should he talk when he's being wined
and dined by the anti-torture statutes?

15:42.024 --> 15:44.569
Those statutes
were written for a reason.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.656
May we have a moment
in private please, ma'am?

16:00.626 --> 16:01.919
[door shuts]

16:02.003 --> 16:04.422
There are other steps
that we could be taking.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.632
If we classify Azam
as an enemy combatant...

16:06.716 --> 16:08.718
- You're advocating torture.
- Your word.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.261
It's not been proven to work.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.098
- More times than not, they'll lie.
- You're tying my hands.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.768
- I didn't write the Constitution.
- It's not a suicide pact.

16:17.852 --> 16:21.022
We have a living, breathing person
in custody who has answers.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.152
Have Homeland raise the terror alert.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.239
Yes, ma'am.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.953
[man] Charlie,
there's nothing to talk about.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.581
- I remember it.
- [Charlie laughing] Nothing. No.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.125
You remember nothing.
Off with their heads?

16:41.209 --> 16:43.169
You don't remember that.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.296
Come on, man.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.173
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hi, Charlie.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.050
Alex, can I borrow you for a second?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.844
Yeah.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.430
Later.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.147
- [door shuts]
- Alex.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.066
Alex.

17:08.277 --> 17:12.323
Look, Alex, what happened today,
it can't happen again.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.742
Whoa, slow down. What're...?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.328
What're you talking about?

17:17.411 --> 17:20.081
The president tells me
what to say and what not to say.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.625
- If you're not in those meetings...
- I ought to be.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.502
- You are. A lot of the times.
- No.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.504
I ought to be in,
and you ought to be out.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.755
That's right.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.091
I'm not... I'm not
the only one who thinks so.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.135
Why don't you ask
our friends in the press corps?

17:34.887 --> 17:38.349
[exhales] You're still upset that
the president gave me the job.

17:38.432 --> 17:42.353
Upset? Upset? That I, a Harvard
graduate, was passed over by someone

17:42.436 --> 17:45.439
who a month ago thought a lid
was something you put on lattes.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.024
Look, I know it's hard...

17:47.108 --> 17:49.860
No, you don't. You don't know anything.

17:50.695 --> 17:55.366
And I'm sick and tired of taking orders
from some UC Santa Barbara Pi Beta Phi

17:55.449 --> 17:58.536
who majored in rushing
and minored in getting on her knees.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.206
Or... I'm sorry,
do I have that backwards?

18:02.290 --> 18:05.209
Did... did you... minor in rushing?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.919
Don't come in tomorrow.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.048
All right. Look, I'm sorry.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.717
Look, I'm sorry, Kelly.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.554
OK? I just... I'm just... I'm just...
I'm just, you know, drunk.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.141
Yeah. You're just, you know, fired.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.729
And next time, check your sources.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.732
I was born in Santa Barbara.
I graduated from Princeton.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.067
Phi Beta Kappa.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.196
What? You're too good
to go trick or treating?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.533
No, not too good. Just... too old.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.744
Nah, never too old.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.913
Well, besides, if I go,
it'll be a huge production.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.750
I mean... Secret Service and whatnot.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.045
And probably press.

18:49.128 --> 18:53.090
You sure? 'Cause I make
a pretty convincing Dracula.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.092
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.471
[as Dracula] I want to suck your blood.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.680
Ahh!

18:59.764 --> 19:02.183
[both laughing]

19:03.601 --> 19:05.853
God, you're beautiful.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.153
[knock on door]

19:15.905 --> 19:18.949
Are you leaving on your own,
or should I call Rebecca's agents?

19:19.033 --> 19:21.118
Madam President,
it's honor to meet you.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.789
It'd be more of an honor if you weren't
in my daughter's bedroom at 11pm.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.124
- Sam?
- Um... Mom, this is Mike Flemming.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.102
We were just studying.

19:29.262 --> 19:31.379
- Ma'am.
- Please show this young man out.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.840
Yeah. Thank you.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.137
Thanks.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.973
Mom, Mike's a good guy.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.643
You're 16. More relevant, he's 16.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.812
- Seventeen.
- Well, OK then.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.897
But he's a total gentleman

19:49.980 --> 19:53.317
and a good guy and a good friend.
Mom, you should have seen him.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.652
I've seen enough. Thanks.

19:54.735 --> 19:58.572
No, I... I mean today, at school,
with Horace. He completely defended him.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.158
Why did Horace need defending?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.035
Um...

20:03.119 --> 20:05.830
...because kids at school
were making fun of Dad.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.172
Hey.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.008
All quiet on the home front?

20:18.092 --> 20:21.929
Can I have the CIA shift
their overwatch to Rebecca's room?

20:22.012 --> 20:24.473
Two Chinooks, four helos total

20:24.557 --> 20:28.144
will be entering Lebanese airspace
within the next 15 minutes.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.146
Shall I update you each step?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.398
- I won't be sleeping.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.286
Mr. Waverly.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.496
Were you able to reach
the first gentleman?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.873
Not yet.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.584
Will the children be going
to school tomorrow?

20:54.545 --> 20:56.046
I think they should stay home.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.299
Very good, ma'am.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.550
If I can ask...

21:00.468 --> 21:03.429
...should I tell my daughter
to keep my grandchildren back?

21:06.515 --> 21:09.435
That, I can't answer.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.354
Seems like most people plan to.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.650
Attention!

21:57.733 --> 22:00.778
Everyone. What do you
have for me, Mr. Secretary?

22:00.861 --> 22:04.406
The Orion team is back on the ground
in Jordan, debriefing and sorting.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.284
- Casualties?
- There were two wounded, one seriously.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.954
Thank you. Please sit.

22:10.955 --> 22:14.124
The, uh, preliminary
assessment is very promising.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.503
They got over 300 data CDs,
ten hard drives, a stack of paper files.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.840
We're fairly confident that they'll
be able to decode and identify

22:20.923 --> 22:22.800
all of Azam's co-conspirators.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.010
But when? Next week?

22:25.094 --> 22:27.346
Azam's attack
was scheduled for 1pm.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.682
It's already 4am.
That gives us ten hours.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.393
Ma'am, Azam still remains
our most valuable asset.

22:32.476 --> 22:36.063
It is my recommendation that he
spend time with the Kilo Charlie team.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.649
- They just got back from...
- Afghanistan. I know.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.234
It's a matter of expertise.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.861
FBI agents spend maybe ten weeks

22:41.944 --> 22:45.573
learning to fight terrorism
within very strict parameters.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.868
Obviously, you agree
with this since just yesterday

22:48.951 --> 22:53.247
you decided that Justice should answer
to NSC on domestic terrorism issues.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.838
I think we wait for news from Amman.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.091
But it could be days. Or weeks.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.260
Yeah.

23:08.929 --> 23:09.930
Hand him over.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.099
But, Melanie,

23:12.182 --> 23:14.685
I don't want to hear
that he was tortured.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.271
- Do you understand me?
- Perfectly.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.274
Thank you.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.110
[man] Ma'am.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.281
I bet you don't know who that is.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.576
Her name is Amy too.
She used to live here.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.538
A long time ago, when
her daddy was the president.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.041
You know what Amy used
to do for Halloween?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.292
Uh-uh.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.795
She'd have a party. I was thinking
maybe we should do the same thing.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.590
- Have a party and go trick or treating?
- Mm...

23:44.673 --> 23:46.717
I was thinking just the party.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.137
But I'm going with Abigail.
And Luke's coming...

23:50.220 --> 23:52.598
I wish people could
celebrate the way they want.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.476
But there's bad guys
that are trying to ruin Halloween,

23:55.559 --> 23:59.063
and it's my job, as a mommy,
to make sure that you're safe.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.858
Are you gonna catch all the bad guys?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.652
- Oh, I hope so.
- Before tonight?

24:04.735 --> 24:07.738
I'm gonna do my best. I promise.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.658
I bet Princess Orion could
catch them right away though.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.327
I'm gonna go take this off.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.382
So we know it's al-Muharib.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.884
That means more than one target, right?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.637
At least. But we have no idea where.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.847
- Who's your source?
- Rod...

24:34.807 --> 24:36.350
Do you have anyone in custody?

24:39.979 --> 24:42.439
If I'm not a part of this,
what am I doing?

24:42.523 --> 24:45.818
Do you have any idea why I was
calling you? Why I couldn't sleep?

24:45.901 --> 24:48.028
It's not just ‘cause of the threat.

24:48.112 --> 24:51.240
Amy is distraught
because I destroyed Halloween.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.867
Rebecca is entertaining
boys in her room.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.369
Horace got into a fight.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.247
OK, look, I didn't mean the kids.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.458
I just...
What's "entertaining," exactly?

25:01.542 --> 25:03.252
I handled Rebecca.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.629
But you should talk to Horace.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.050
- A fight, huh?
- Greer called it an incident.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.052
Will you talk to Horace please?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.971
Sure.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.476
What did you want to talk about?
What happened in Baltimore?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.895
Oh, it's nothing
you need to worry about.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.242
- Hey.
- Hey. Whatcha doing?

25:35.325 --> 25:37.828
I was trying to find
a horror movie for tonight.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.581
Best I'm gonna do
for Halloween, considering...

25:41.749 --> 25:43.250
I heard you got in a fight.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.046
I want to know what happened.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.341
Hey. Did he insult you?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.428
Your sister?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.014
Your mom?

25:59.433 --> 26:00.434
Me?

26:01.602 --> 26:03.187
Pretty easy target these days.

26:06.648 --> 26:10.402
Horace, I know it's an adjustment,
but I am proud of what I'm doing here.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.113
- And you don't need to defend me.
- Someone's gotta.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.407
You're a national joke, Dad.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.910
No one's noticed Mom is
the first female president

26:17.993 --> 26:19.912
because they laugh
at her wuss husband.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.873
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.626
Don't you walk away from me.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.213
- Just forget it.
- Wait a minute.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.465
You think I can forget
what you said to me?

26:31.548 --> 26:34.051
- Dad, I didn't mean it.
- Get out of here!

26:42.101 --> 26:43.644
- Hey, Gordon.
- There he is.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.479
- This me?
- Right there.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.314
- You look good.
- Thanks.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.482
You look really good.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.317
I think I've lost a few pounds.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.653
You're taking that little blue pill.

26:52.736 --> 26:56.824
- [laughing] Oh, come on now.
- You're blushing.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.744
We'll toss a few things around. I'm sure
you want to get into the vouchers bill.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.788
Whatever you like. It's your show.

27:02.871 --> 27:06.083
I'm sorry if I'm a little...
I just... Off the record?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.669
Thank you. Thanks.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.256
I just came out of the intel meeting

27:12.339 --> 27:14.675
on this Missouri business,
it's always scary.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.260
We're on in ten.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.429
These sessions, our president...

27:19.513 --> 27:22.141
- We should get into that.
- Oh, golly, no. Please.

27:22.224 --> 27:25.352
Don't put me on the spot.
You know me and my mouth.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.437
- You're on.
- Hello. I'm Gordon Blake.

27:27.521 --> 27:31.775
And this is Speaker of the House Nathan
Templeton. This is The War Room.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.112
Speaker, tell me,

27:35.195 --> 27:38.031
is the president
of the United States soft on terrorism?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.952
You're dealing from
the bottom of the deck, Gordon.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.662
There's a terror alert.

27:43.745 --> 27:48.167
It would be very remiss
of me to, in any way,

27:48.250 --> 27:50.669
criticize the president
at a time like this.

27:50.752 --> 27:54.631
Well, can you look into that camera,
our audience, and tell America,

27:54.715 --> 27:57.676
"Worry not. Your children
will be safe this Halloween"?

27:57.759 --> 28:00.637
[laughing] You're incorrigible.

28:00.721 --> 28:05.184
Now you're asking me to speak
for the president and her NSC team.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.061
Because that's where
the security of the country lies.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.272
It lies with her.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.192
I'm not gonna tell
the president what to do,

28:13.275 --> 28:15.402
not on national television, anyway.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.696
What I can say,

28:17.779 --> 28:22.409
and I am confident that the president
would agree with me saying it,

28:22.492 --> 28:25.662
is that this is not a time
for politics.

28:25.746 --> 28:30.667
This is the time for the president
to do everything within her power...

28:30.751 --> 28:33.212
...to keep Americans alive.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.173
Do you have any other
family in the United States?

28:36.256 --> 28:38.091
No. No, I don't.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.761
- [man] In Canada?
- [Azam] No.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.930
[man] We know you're a Saudi citizen.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.891
I'm new, but I'm sure you're
not supposed to be doing this.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.393
- I'm sorry.
- Be thankful I caught you and not Jim.

28:48.477 --> 28:52.022
I was wondering and curious
at how it was going with the prisoner.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.942
We're sending him
for a more aggressive interrogation.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.526
- Good.
- Pardon me?

28:56.610 --> 29:00.906
If it means stopping him and nabbing
other terrorists, do whatever it takes.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.409
I'm surprised to hear that.
You're strong on Palestinian rights.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.871
Yes, I am. I'm just not very big
on terrorists having rights.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.874
There's a difference. Thanks
to them, people don't see it.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.293
I say boil the bastard alive.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.101
- Hey.
- Hey. Weren't you in Baltimore?

29:29.184 --> 29:30.477
Mm-hm.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.729
Business or pleasure?

29:35.816 --> 29:37.567
It started out as pleasure.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.486
Wanna swap lives?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.365
I don't, uh...

29:43.448 --> 29:46.159
I don't think you'd make
a good baseball commissioner.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.744
Hmm?

29:48.537 --> 29:50.664
I got offered the job.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.917
Wow. Can you believe that?

29:54.001 --> 29:57.296
What? When did that
happen? That's fantastic.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.548
- Mm-hm.
- What are you gonna do?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.342
It's, uh... it's complicated.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.178
Yeah. A little.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.348
The truth is, there's no legal
reason I can't take that job.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.350
You might be happier.

30:12.144 --> 30:16.648
Plus, Horace must be jazzed.
That's every boy's dream.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.484
Yeah.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.530
[exhales] I gotta go.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.537
Aren't those for Amy?

30:32.539 --> 30:35.292
- Didn't I ask you to get Anthony?
- Yes, ma'am.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.377
Then why isn't he here?

30:37.461 --> 30:40.297
Because you would ask him
why he doesn't have any updates,

30:40.380 --> 30:43.633
and I thought I would spare him
the seventh trip down the hall.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.469
Why doesn't he have any updates?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.223
- You see The War Room this morning?
- No. Why?

30:50.307 --> 30:54.144
Gordon Blake had Templeton on.
He implied that if anything happened...

30:54.227 --> 30:58.231
I don't want to get into political games
with Templeton. Don't take the bait.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.987
If we're lucky, my second day
might be better than the first.

31:04.071 --> 31:08.325
We've got names of co-conspirators
and specific school targets.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.119
The question is, can we
round them up in time.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.627
We have the entire cell in custody.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.589
As a precaution we're keeping heightened
security at the other target schools

31:22.672 --> 31:26.009
in... uh... Bloomington,
Hillsboro and Fort Worth.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.512
I want to visit
all four schools on Monday.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.514
I'll set it up.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.682
So... that's it.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.852
I don't know about you, but I
could not pull another all-nighter.

31:35.936 --> 31:36.978
[laughter]

31:37.062 --> 31:39.022
I don't bounce back like in college.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.691
- Ask Anthony.
- I think you did just fine.

31:41.775 --> 31:46.196
Operation Orion was an inspired
move. Not to mention aptly named.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.864
But at what cost?

31:47.948 --> 31:50.367
Two black ops in the hospital,
millions of dollars

31:50.450 --> 31:53.495
and the loss of Shahid training camp
as a future source of intel.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.539
And the foreign minister of Lebanon

31:55.622 --> 31:58.041
will be canceling his visit
to the White House.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.378
I assure you that on Monday morning,
when I'm saying the Pledge

32:01.461 --> 32:04.381
with the children of Alexander
Hamilton Elementary,

32:04.464 --> 32:06.716
I will not be regretting
any of my actions.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.635
Absolutely, ma'am. My point is,

32:08.718 --> 32:12.222
simply, we have limited resources,
and there are limitless threats.

32:12.305 --> 32:17.060
I got the same list of co-conspirators
from Azam's interrogation.

32:17.144 --> 32:21.940
Plus, coordinates of safe houses
they may use in the future.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.571
What's done is done.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.700
The important thing is you
just averted the first major threat

32:31.783 --> 32:34.744
of your administration,
Madam President. Congratulations.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.164
[all] Congratulations.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.124
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:43.336 --> 32:47.174
Hi. You look so cute.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.759
Is it too late to have the party?

32:49.843 --> 32:52.929
Oh, baby. This is what
you wanted to do.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.098
It's gonna be really, really fun.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.350
What's the matter, hon?
You still scared?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.771
Maybe it's OK to be
a little scared on Halloween.

33:01.855 --> 33:04.274
You caught all the bad guys, right?

33:04.357 --> 33:07.527
We wouldn't let you go
if it wasn't safe. You know that.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.030
Are you sure you can't come?

33:10.113 --> 33:13.533
Yeah. Pete and Eddie
aren't gonna let me come.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.285
But Daddy's gonna come with you.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.621
Mommy's gonna have
a huge jar of candy corn

33:17.704 --> 33:20.540
- to share with us when we get back.
- Half a jar, maybe.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.459
We better go.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.712
Come on.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.302
[engine starting]

33:38.808 --> 33:41.186
Happy Halloween.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.662
- That Amy's stash?
- Yeah.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.747
- Do you want some?
- No, thanks.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.917
Hey.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.378
About earlier...

34:08.129 --> 34:12.175
I'm sorry I said what I said, but...

34:12.259 --> 34:14.386
But what?

34:15.262 --> 34:17.264
You're the son of the president, Horace.

34:17.347 --> 34:20.934
People have opinions. You can't go
after every jerk who has a remark.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.852
I didn't have a choice!

34:22.936 --> 34:25.272
And I say you do.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.191
[sighs] Yeah.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.288
Straight ahead, sir.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.210
Madam President.

34:47.294 --> 34:50.213
- Nathan.
- [sighs]

34:50.297 --> 34:54.384
Well, bloody hell.
It's been really something.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.386
Uh... yeah. It has.

34:56.469 --> 35:00.724
A defining moment for you.
For us. For all of us.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.059
At times like these
we're all Independents.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.561
Hmm.

35:04.644 --> 35:08.898
Anyway, I just wanted
to say to you, you did good.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.862
Well, thank you.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.240
That uh... that means
a great deal to me.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.701
Thank you very much.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.911
When I think of how close we came...

35:21.995 --> 35:23.288
Hmm.

35:23.371 --> 35:26.291
Anyway, what's his name,
Azam, talked and...

35:27.500 --> 35:29.252
...that's what's important.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.422
Intelligence oversight.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.091
I see the same secret papers you do.

35:35.175 --> 35:39.137
I'm subject to the same
code of silence you are. And...

35:39.220 --> 35:41.640
...I will not speak a word.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.851
That is after all, unspeakable.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.978
But this is the business we've chosen,

35:47.062 --> 35:49.022
this business of leading,

35:49.105 --> 35:52.150
paying the price for the greater good.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.654
Mr. Speaker, what the hell
are you talking about?

35:57.364 --> 35:59.157
Nathan?

36:02.202 --> 36:03.953
Madam President.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.540
Just you and me.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.251
No one else here.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.462
I'm trying to tell you...

36:13.880 --> 36:15.840
...that I am proud of you.

36:17.258 --> 36:21.471
You understand the burdens
of the necessary evil.

36:21.554 --> 36:25.392
I didn't think that was part
of your makeup. I was wrong.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.728
I was trying to congratulate you.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.941
[exhales]

36:33.024 --> 36:34.734
Well...

36:36.528 --> 36:37.987
...good night, Nathan.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.784
Good night.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.869
Congratulations.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.996
Sleep well.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.295
[sighs]

37:00.176 --> 37:01.177
Ma'am?

37:02.178 --> 37:03.513
What happened with Azam?

37:03.596 --> 37:06.182
- He talked.
- Why did he talk?

37:07.684 --> 37:10.270
I told you, Kilo Charlie
was better equipped to...

37:10.353 --> 37:12.856
Better equipped with what? Electrodes?

37:12.939 --> 37:14.899
I said there was to be no torture.

37:14.983 --> 37:18.361
You said no such thing. You said you
didn't want to hear about torture.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.447
Presidents don't speak in metaphors.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.575
"I don't want to hear"
means "I don't want to hear."

37:29.581 --> 37:32.542
- Is he alive?
- Barely. I don't care or give a damn.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.377
I do.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.964
If I thought there were another way...

37:38.047 --> 37:39.716
We found another way.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.469
There's always another way.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.804
I am not prepared
to ever accept torture.

37:44.888 --> 37:48.099
Then perhaps you're not
prepared to be president.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.560
Do you really think
that what you did was right?

37:50.643 --> 37:53.563
I am not gonna have
any trouble sleeping tonight.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.607
Could you have done it yourself?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.901
Why send him to a special military unit?

37:57.984 --> 38:00.153
Why not do it right here,
in the Oval Office?

38:00.236 --> 38:02.739
Strap him down to my desk.
That's what you did...

38:02.822 --> 38:05.241
He wanted to kill our children.

38:05.325 --> 38:08.411
And you would have had to see
the corpses of our children.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.414
When you saw them you would
have said to yourself one thing:

38:11.498 --> 38:14.250
"I would have given anything
to have prevented this."

38:15.251 --> 38:16.336
Well, you did.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.259
Principles mean little when we're
the only ones playing by the rules.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.595
Those bastards don't
deserve our protection.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.389
The rules are not there to protect them.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.433
They are to protect us.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.019
Other nations follow us.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.105
If we torture, there is nothing
to prevent other countries

38:36.189 --> 38:39.609
from doing the same to our citizens.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.111
Understood.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.957
You are relieved of your duties.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.713
And I'm not talking in metaphors.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.809
[thunder]

39:36.541 --> 39:38.543
Madam President?

39:46.634 --> 39:48.845
I spoke with Melanie.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.270
If you need me, I'll be in my office.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.272
Thank you.
