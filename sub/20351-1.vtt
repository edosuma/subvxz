I'm home, you guys.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.083
Look at the diversity in this room.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.333
Every color.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.875
That's what I love about Seattle.

01:02.958 --> 01:06.788
There's every color
just mixed with everybody else.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.133
Good shit.

01:12.917 --> 01:14.787
We've got Latinos out here.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.535
Somehow you guys swam up.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.037
"Just keep going!"

01:28.542 --> 01:30.752
"I swear to God, <i>mijo. </i> Keep going!"

01:34.708 --> 01:37.418
When I first moved out here...
Like, when I was living out here,

01:37.500 --> 01:41.130
this is where the Indian casinos
started opening.

01:42.458 --> 01:46.958
Like Muckleshoot. Remember that?
Is that still around?

01:47.042 --> 01:49.542
- Yeah!
- Muckleshoot?

01:49.625 --> 01:53.495
But when an Asian says it,
it sounds more Asian than Indian.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.543
"Muckleshoot. You want to play..."

01:56.625 --> 01:59.285
Where you play?
Muck... Muckleshoot.

02:00.833 --> 02:04.583
"Play blackjack at Muckle... Muckleshoot."

02:10.625 --> 02:13.875
You go to the Indian reservation.
I've never seen any Indians.

02:15.375 --> 02:19.575
There's more... I don't see any.
It's just all Vietnamese people and...

02:20.500 --> 02:21.960
Chinese people.

02:24.208 --> 02:29.628
That's all. I want to see an Indian.
One. Just one. Give me one Indian.

02:29.708 --> 02:32.668
I want to see Pocahontas.
Just one Pocahontas.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.960
Just give me an Indian lady.
One Indian lady.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.833
I swear to God, if I find her, it's over.

02:41.750 --> 02:46.790
It's over. I want a hot Indian wife,
and I'll marry her,

02:46.875 --> 02:48.455
and I'll have ten kids with her,

02:49.375 --> 02:51.575
just so when I load the van,
I can go...

02:51.667 --> 02:54.327
<i>♪ One little, two little
Three little Indians ♪</i>

02:54.417 --> 02:56.457
<i>♪ Four little, five little
Six little Indians ♪</i>

02:56.542 --> 02:58.212
<i>♪ Seven little, eight little... ♪</i>

03:01.208 --> 03:04.038
I love watching...
When women laugh, it's my favorite.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.955
Because when women laugh,
they laugh hard.

03:07.792 --> 03:09.712
They don't give a shit.

03:09.792 --> 03:12.582
If it's funny, they're, like,
"Oh, my God. Right?"

03:13.458 --> 03:17.498
Ten Indians. And then he'll count,
like the fucking song!

03:17.583 --> 03:19.253
Hilarious!

03:19.333 --> 03:21.083
"Hilarious!"

03:24.083 --> 03:27.883
Women will laugh and cry.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.955
Women will laugh and cry
because they're emotional creatures.

03:33.042 --> 03:36.132
They can't give you one emotion.
"I gotta give you two!"

03:37.375 --> 03:40.825
Ha ha ha! Are you serious?
Are you happy?

03:40.917 --> 03:44.577
Ha ha ha! Fuck! Fuck!

03:44.667 --> 03:47.327
"Seriously, stop! Fuck!"

03:48.958 --> 03:51.078
And they do this shit. What is that?

03:51.917 --> 03:56.747
Because they're crying,
and that's their way of drying the tears.

03:56.833 --> 04:00.173
Fanning tears. That's fucking water!

04:00.958 --> 04:03.038
You can't fan water!

04:03.125 --> 04:06.955
You don't get out of the shower and go,
"Oh, my God, that shower was amazing.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.460
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be late!"

04:18.125 --> 04:23.035
Women will laugh and pee.
They don't give a shit.

04:23.125 --> 04:27.785
In public. In public!
In front of their friends.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.268
They don't give a shit.
They'll tell their friends,

04:29.292 --> 04:32.002
"He's funny, right?"
"I know. I just peed a little.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.833
I swear to God."
"A little? Bitch, that's a lot."

04:34.917 --> 04:39.457
"I don't give a fuck.
It's funny. It's funny."

04:41.250 --> 04:43.580
And I love it when women laugh

04:43.667 --> 04:46.627
and they threaten
that they want you to stop,

04:46.708 --> 04:49.328
and if you don't, they're gonna pee.
They threaten you.

04:49.417 --> 04:53.917
"Stop. No, seriously, stop!
I swear to God, I'm gonna pee!"

04:54.000 --> 04:59.540
Stop it! Oh, my God! Stop! Stop!
I'm gonna pee.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.245
Look, look!

05:03.333 --> 05:05.333
Seriously.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.877
"You're crazy."

05:10.000 --> 05:16.074

05:19.208 --> 05:20.668
This is amazing.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.040
Look, she's crying right now!

05:23.125 --> 05:26.915
Where's the hand? Look at her!
And then look at her crotch. Piss.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.500
She just pissed.
You got that on tape, right?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.463
Welcome to Hollywood, bitch.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.351
She did exactly what I said.
She went like that, then went like that,

05:36.375 --> 05:39.705
and she went, like, "Oh, my God.
Fucking stop! I'm about to shit!"

05:39.792 --> 05:43.042
I'm gonna shit.
You want me to shit? I'll shit."

05:46.208 --> 05:49.038
I'm half-white, half-Filipino.
That's what I am.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.038
Which means my dad was in the military.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.248
That's not even a joke.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.043
That's real shit.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.133
A lot of soldiers were fighting
for this country.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.538
My dad was dating.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.830
I'm his Purple Heart.

06:17.042 --> 06:19.752
My dad would say borderline-racist shit
to me when I was a kid.

06:20.542 --> 06:23.132
Borderline-racist shit.
But I knew he was joking. It's my dad.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.143
Just sitting at the dinner table, like,
"You know why I married your mom, right?"

06:26.167 --> 06:27.327
I'm, like, "Why?"

06:28.500 --> 06:30.000
"Because I love Chinese food."

06:38.458 --> 06:40.208
"She's Filipino, Dad."

06:42.792 --> 06:44.132
"Whatever."

06:46.500 --> 06:47.920
"Rice is rice."

06:49.125 --> 06:53.495
What the fuck? "Rice is rice!"

06:53.583 --> 06:55.633
That's so racist!

06:56.500 --> 06:59.580
I'm not knocking what my mom had to do
to get to America.

06:59.667 --> 07:03.747
Fuck it. That's her hustle.
That was her hustle.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.880
God bless you, Mom.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.458
You hooked up with a soldier
and had a kid in America.

07:08.542 --> 07:13.212
God bless you, Mom.
She did what she had to do.

07:13.292 --> 07:16.132
She could've hooked up with a Filipino
and had a kid in the Philippines.

07:16.167 --> 07:19.167
You know how much a comedian makes
in the Philippines?

07:19.917 --> 07:23.327
A chicken and flip-flops.
Fuck that. Fuck that.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.207
I don't even like flip-flops.

07:29.708 --> 07:30.878
My mom was the shit.

07:30.958 --> 07:34.378
My mom and dad divorced
when I was, like, 10, 11 years old.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.750
My mom had to raise us on her own.
She did that shit on her own.

07:39.833 --> 07:42.173
Tough as shit. She had...

07:44.375 --> 07:46.705
Sometimes a little too tough.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.582
Like, it was borderline illegal, but...

07:51.458 --> 07:52.958
It sucked.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.920
My mom never took us to the doctor.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.130
My mom raised us like we were still
in the Philippines.

08:00.333 --> 08:05.083
She tried to cure everything at home,
like a real Filipino woman.

08:05.917 --> 08:09.827
You had to die to go to the hospital.

08:10.667 --> 08:14.957
Shit. My mom cured everything
with Vicks VapoRub.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.875
Vicks VapoRub!

08:20.292 --> 08:23.792
I should've died nine times
when I was a kid.

08:23.875 --> 08:27.625
That's abuse! There was one time
I thought I had pneumonia.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.059
I go, "Mom, I think I have pneumonia."

08:29.083 --> 08:31.633
She goes, "I'll put extra Vicks
on your body, Joseph."

08:32.582 --> 08:37.793
Just rub it everywhere, Joseph.
Rub it on the bottom of the foot,

08:37.875 --> 08:40.034
and then put a sock on the foot,

08:41.082 --> 08:44.043
"and then the pneumonia
will come out of the foot, Joseph."

08:47.750 --> 08:50.330
I'm just smothered in fucking Vicks.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.582
I should've called the cops.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.575
One time I was so sick...
I swear to God, true story...

08:59.667 --> 09:03.247
I go, "Mom, I don't feel good.
I can't sleep. I can't sleep, Mom."

09:03.333 --> 09:06.633
My mom took her finger
and stuck it in Vicks

09:07.458 --> 09:09.378
and rubbed it on top of my eyelids.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.418
On top of my eyelids!

09:13.375 --> 09:16.495
That shit burned so bad.
I go, "Mom, it burns!"

09:16.583 --> 09:18.753
I can't open my eyes!"

09:18.833 --> 09:20.673
My mom goes, "Well, then you can sleep."

09:23.375 --> 09:24.995
"Good night, Joseph."

09:30.917 --> 09:32.667
She didn't give a shit.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.423
Mean.

09:37.875 --> 09:42.625
She never hit us. My mom never hit us.
She just scared us a lot.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.828
She loved to curse,
and she used to flex like that.

09:45.917 --> 09:49.577
She used to do that shit!
She brought that to America!

09:50.542 --> 09:54.292
Anyone who does this shit,
hey, my mom started that shit.

09:54.375 --> 09:58.625
She did it to all of us.
You know how embarrassing that is,

09:58.708 --> 10:02.708
to get pumped by a four-foot-eight
Asian woman at the fucking mall?

10:02.792 --> 10:05.922
"Get out of the goddamn Foot Locker.
Get out of the Foot Locker!"

10:06.000 --> 10:08.380
"I'm not even in the Foot Locker!"

10:17.750 --> 10:21.420
I used to cry and tell my mom,
"Mom, when I have kids,

10:21.500 --> 10:25.500
I'm never gonna do what you do to me
to my kids."

10:26.625 --> 10:29.518
And my mom looked at me... I swear to God...
She put her hand on my shoulder and goes,

10:29.542 --> 10:31.462
"Joseph, promise me, okay?

10:32.542 --> 10:34.422
Never have kids."

10:46.667 --> 10:48.877
Shit on my dreams.
I'm telling you this:

10:48.958 --> 10:51.918
I became a comedian,
which is totally against the grain

10:52.000 --> 10:53.790
when you have a Filipino mom.

10:53.875 --> 10:58.785
If you have a Filipino mom, that is not
the career choice you're supposed to have.

10:58.875 --> 11:03.665
Filipino moms predetermine what their kids
are supposed to be when they grow up.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.390
And you know I'm not making this shit up.

11:05.417 --> 11:08.207
There's a lot of Filipinos in here...
I know...

11:08.292 --> 11:09.672
That are nurses.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.130
Today is a good day to get injured
at a show...

11:21.000 --> 11:22.913
because there will be a nurse in here,
like...

11:22.914 --> 11:24.865
"Oh, my God.
Put a cold compress on the head."

11:26.083 --> 11:30.083
"Elebate the peet! Elebate...
Elebate the peet."

11:30.167 --> 11:34.327
"What the fuck is 'elebate'?"
"Just lift! Lift the pucking peet!

11:34.417 --> 11:35.957
Are you stupid?"

11:38.750 --> 11:43.290
And I'm not... I'm not shitting on you
for being a nurse.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.575
That's a great job, great benefits,
good money.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.577
I'm just saying, it wasn't your dream.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.125
That was your Filipino mom's dream.

11:54.042 --> 11:57.632
My mom wanted <i>me </i> to be a nurse.
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:57.708 --> 12:02.538
Filipino moms shit on their kids' dreams.
And you know I'm not lying.

12:02.625 --> 12:06.535
You know I'm not lying.
You can't have a dream.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.415
"What are you talking about... dream?"

12:09.875 --> 12:13.125
I told my mom I wanted to be a comedian.
She cried. "Why?"

12:13.958 --> 12:16.828
Why do you want to be a comedian, Joseph?

12:17.625 --> 12:22.995
All your aunties are nurses,
your cousins are nurses.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.883
Do you see any clowns in this family?

12:25.958 --> 12:28.498
"I don't. Do you?"

12:32.292 --> 12:34.132
Shit on my dream right there.

12:34.208 --> 12:38.458
Just looked at me and went like this:
"Joseph, who told you you were funny?"

12:43.792 --> 12:45.632
"It wasn't me."

12:48.542 --> 12:49.752
That's fucked up.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.578
I'm just saying...
You're a nurse, God bless you.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.577
But you know
there are some nurses out there

12:55.667 --> 12:57.207
that didn't follow their dreams.

12:57.292 --> 12:58.976
There are some nurses working
at the hospital

12:59.000 --> 13:00.630
that wish they were a Jabbawockee.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.142
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.542
"Hey, follow me to the X-ray."
"I'll follow you..."

13:14.958 --> 13:16.998
Goddamn, that nurse can dance.

13:18.167 --> 13:20.207
"It was always my dream."

13:22.708 --> 13:25.578
"My mother did not believe in me."

13:26.417 --> 13:27.667
Oh, fuck.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.625
It's either nurse or mailman.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.705
Mailman's another strong option.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.627
Oh, shit. My mom cried
and even suggested,

13:46.708 --> 13:48.828
"Joseph, be a mailman.

13:48.917 --> 13:54.247
Your uncles are mailmen.
Your cousins, they're mailmen."

13:55.125 --> 13:59.325
My stepdad, he's white.
He's a fucking mailman!

13:59.417 --> 14:02.957
I swear to God. I asked him,
"Fred, why'd you become a mailman?"

14:03.042 --> 14:05.082
He's, like, "Your mama told me
to become a mailman."

14:06.042 --> 14:08.882
She shit on my dreams."

14:12.333 --> 14:14.043
I came home from school,

14:14.125 --> 14:16.995
and my mom had my uncle come over
and talk to me

14:17.083 --> 14:20.083
about getting into the post office.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.377
That's how... Right? It's fucked up, right?

14:22.458 --> 14:24.018
Come home from school,
and here's my uncle.

14:24.042 --> 14:28.582
By the way, my uncle is one of
those Filipinos that hide their accent.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.747
He's got a thick accent,
but he likes to hide the accent

14:31.833 --> 14:34.713
because he doesn't want anybody to think
that he has an accent.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.172
And it just ends up sounding
like a worse accent.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.165
He sounds like a Filipino Elvis.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.268
And I came home, I came through the door.
He got up, he's, like...

14:43.292 --> 14:46.012
"Joseph, let me talk to you for a second."

14:54.375 --> 14:56.625
"So, I hear you want to be a comedian?"

14:56.708 --> 14:58.668
Like, what the fuck did you just say?

15:00.208 --> 15:03.328
Filipino moms,
stop turning into Filipino moms.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I can guarantee you right now...
That there's a ton of Filipinos in here,

15:08.083 --> 15:10.293
but I can tell you,
I don't know any of you,

15:10.375 --> 15:14.375
but if you met my mom,
I guarantee she looks just like your mom.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.583
Identical fucking twins.

15:18.583 --> 15:19.633
Just...

15:21.583 --> 15:24.003
They're just cut from the same cloth.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.878
I don't know what it is
about Filipino women.

15:26.958 --> 15:30.038
They're beautiful at the age of 20,
but right when they hit 69,

15:30.125 --> 15:32.455
they all morph
into the same Filipino woman.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.793
Short hair, glasses.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.377
Louis Vuitton purse.

15:39.875 --> 15:43.125
"Where are we? Seattle? Moore Theatre?"

15:50.292 --> 15:52.212
Break that mold, man.

15:54.125 --> 15:57.205
I told my son. I told him.
I'm breaking that mold.

15:57.292 --> 16:01.332
I looked at my son right in the eyes,
and I go, "Joe, look, if you have a dream"

16:01.417 --> 16:04.037
and you think you want to do it
and you believe in it,

16:04.125 --> 16:07.535
then chase that dream. It'll happen."
That's what I said.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.083
"As long as you continue
to follow that dream,

16:13.167 --> 16:15.997
your dad's got your back.
I got you, bro, 100 percent."

16:16.083 --> 16:17.883
He goes, "Oh, my God. Thanks, Dad."

16:17.958 --> 16:20.168
I go, "What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

16:20.250 --> 16:22.380
He goes, "I want to be an architect."

16:23.417 --> 16:24.537
And I go, "Joe..."

16:26.167 --> 16:27.787
I've seen you draw.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.455
You got another dream?
What the fuck are you talking about?

16:32.542 --> 16:36.632
"You ever think about nursing?
Get the fuck out of here."

16:37.625 --> 16:40.665
I love my kid, but I understand
where my mom's coming from,

16:40.750 --> 16:42.130
because he's at that age.

16:42.208 --> 16:45.958
Right when he turned 12, that's when
he just stopped taking care of himself.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.882
And that's when I stopped
taking care of him.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.438
Because that's what you're supposed to do
when you're a parent.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.830
Twelve? "You should know how
to brush your teeth now."

16:54.875 --> 16:56.285
You know what to do, Joe."

16:56.375 --> 16:58.915
But now that I ignore the fact
that he doesn't brush his teeth,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.920
I have to fucking deal with the breath.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.460
The breath, it comes in hot.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.960
Hot. And he's breathy when he talks.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.252
"Dad."

17:12.958 --> 17:14.578
Dad.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.247
"Dad."

17:16.333 --> 17:19.333
I'm, like, "Joe, what did I tell you to do
when you talk to me?"

17:20.416 --> 17:21.707
"Face the wall."

17:26.541 --> 17:28.382
"Face the wall and write it down.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.787
Let me read what the fuck
you're trying to say to me."

17:33.500 --> 17:35.250
Armpits. God damn it.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.463
Armpits smell like chopped onions.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.128
And I always get mad. I'm, like,
"Joe, why do I smell it first?

17:42.208 --> 17:45.878
I'm over here.
You're right fucking here."

17:49.208 --> 17:51.768
I grab the deodorant every time.
"Joe, this is all you gotta do."

17:51.792 --> 17:54.962
Just rub it under this armpit like that.
That's all you gotta do.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.601
Now, listen to me.
Here's the important part.

17:56.625 --> 18:00.575
"When you go to the other armpit,
I want you to go across your mouth."

18:10.042 --> 18:16.582
Just dirty. My son is dirty. He loves it.
He thinks it's the funniest thing.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.497
Still doesn't know how
to sneeze correctly.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.083
Are you kidding me?

18:20.167 --> 18:23.167
My friend had a daughter
the same time I had my son.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.330
She's been cute her whole life.

18:25.417 --> 18:28.537
When she would sneeze, she'd announce it.
"I gotta sneeze, Mommy.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.665
I need a napkin."

18:32.083 --> 18:33.713
Her mom would run over with a napkin.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.518
"Here you go, baby.
Put your nose in the napkin."

18:35.542 --> 18:38.632
"I gotta sneeze, Mom.
I gotta sneeze."

18:42.125 --> 18:43.665
It's fucking beautiful.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.383
Glitter.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.785
When my son sneezes, no announcement.

18:51.875 --> 18:56.165
His face just explodes, mid-conversation.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.580
It always happens at the restaurant.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.587
He's, like, "Dad,
did you see how many points..."

19:08.792 --> 19:11.042
And then I still help him.
I grab a napkin.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.955
"Here, wipe your face, Joe."
Because I'm a good dad.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.332
Let me do that with my mom
when I was a kid.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.707
Shit. At the dinner table.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.132
"Mom, can you pass a..."

19:21.208 --> 19:23.328
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

19:27.792 --> 19:30.632
Are your hands broken when you sneeze?

19:30.708 --> 19:33.628
When you sneeze,
you can't use your fucking hands?

19:33.708 --> 19:38.128
You could not go like that?
Now there's boogers on the chicken.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.077
You're eating all the booger chicken,
Joseph.

19:42.167 --> 19:45.747
All of that is yours.
Enjoy boogers and chicken.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.173
"Delicious, huh?"

19:49.583 --> 19:52.833
The whole week, I gotta eat
booger chicken sandwiches at school.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.130
And she'd make fun of me.
"How was your sandwich?"

19:56.917 --> 19:58.327
Salty, huh?

19:59.208 --> 20:00.578
"Cover your mouth."

20:01.250 --> 20:03.000
I'm ready for my son,

20:03.083 --> 20:06.383
and I'm financially prepared
to take care of him for the next 15 years.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.043
I know that. As a man, as a dad,

20:11.125 --> 20:13.665
I know I have to take care of my son
for the next 15 years.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.460
Why? Because he's a boy.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.833
Boys don't leave the fucking house.
They don't leave.

20:19.917 --> 20:22.747
How do I know that?
Because I didn't leave the house.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.503
I didn't leave the house till I was 28.

20:26.583 --> 20:29.083
"I ain't leaving. My mom can cook."

20:30.250 --> 20:31.790
And I'm ready for that.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.495
Now, if I had a daughter,
I wouldn't put a dime away.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.043
Not a penny. Not a cent. Why?

20:37.125 --> 20:40.325
Because girls mature quicker,
they grow up faster,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.747
and they get the fuck out of the house!

20:43.917 --> 20:48.877
"Don't talk to me like that, Mom!
That's bullshit! I'm a fucking woman!

20:50.208 --> 20:51.748
Don't touch me, Dad."

20:53.333 --> 20:57.083
Girls at 18 don't give a shit.
They're ready for the world.

20:57.167 --> 20:59.747
And you know what I'm talking about.
Don't act like you don't.

20:59.833 --> 21:02.293
There's women in here that left at 18.

21:02.375 --> 21:05.415
And the reason why I know
is because I have two sisters...

21:05.500 --> 21:08.250
Gemma and Rowena.
Both of them left at 18,

21:08.333 --> 21:10.503
and neither one of them came back.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.035
That's some gangster shit.

21:14.125 --> 21:18.915
My sister Rowena was the first one to go.
Had a full-time job at Wendy's.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.420
Swear to God. Shift supervisor.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.250
She thought she was a fucking millionaire!

21:26.583 --> 21:29.923
Showed me her paychecks every week.
"Look at this shit. I'm rich."

21:31.875 --> 21:35.325
And she was ready. Got into the last fight
with my mom in the living room.

21:35.417 --> 21:38.827
She had it. "Whatever, Mom. I'm going.
I'm getting the fuck out of here."

21:38.917 --> 21:41.717
I'm sick of these fucking rules.
I'm old enough to take care of myself.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.672
And you know what? Me and Brian,
we've been looking for a place,

21:44.750 --> 21:47.710
"and when we find it,
I'm fucking out of here!"

21:49.375 --> 21:51.995
And my mom just looked at her
and goes, "Are you fucking crazy?"

21:53.000 --> 21:54.960
Get the fuck out of here right now."

21:59.917 --> 22:03.827
And my sister didn't even flinch.
"Fine! Fuck it! I'm out of here!"

22:03.917 --> 22:08.247
And she left. My sister left at 18
and never came back.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.753
That's some gangster shit.

22:10.833 --> 22:14.333
I remember that day like it was yesterday.
She was in the garage,

22:14.417 --> 22:16.327
loading the trunk of her car
with all her shit,

22:16.417 --> 22:17.917
and I was upstairs in my room.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.750
And then my sister yelled up to my room,
"I love you so much, Joe!"

22:21.833 --> 22:23.213
And I started crying.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.633
And I looked at my mom.
I go, "She's gonna die!"

22:33.500 --> 22:35.920
"She's gonna die, Mom!"

22:36.792 --> 22:39.252
And my mom looked at me and goes,
"Well, then let her die."

22:41.750 --> 22:43.790
"You want to die with her, Joseph?"

22:43.875 --> 22:46.165
"I don't want to die!"

22:47.833 --> 22:50.503
And she left, and she never came back.

22:50.583 --> 22:53.923
Then my other sister, Gemma, 18... left.
She never came back.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.960
My sisters are the shit. The shit!

22:57.042 --> 22:59.332
Because I didn't leave till I was 28.

23:00.542 --> 23:03.632
Twenty-eight! And even then
I wasn't sure I was ready to go.

23:03.708 --> 23:05.208
I swear to God.

23:05.292 --> 23:08.172
I remember standing at the doorway
with a garbage bag full of my clothes,

23:08.208 --> 23:11.168
and I looked at my mom. I go,
"Mom, are you sure you want me to leave?"

23:18.125 --> 23:20.915
And my mom goes, "Yes, Joseph. It's time."

23:22.000 --> 23:25.080
It's time for you to be a man now, Joseph.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.415
"Now move to the garage."

23:35.625 --> 23:38.205
And I moved to the garage
like a fucking man.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.212
Twenty-eight.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.497
And then I moved back in at 29.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.540
It was cold in that garage.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.535
I go, "Mom, there's no insulation
in the garage."

23:50.625 --> 23:54.625
And my mom let me back in.
"Come back in here, Joseph."

23:54.708 --> 23:57.958
That's what she always does.
I always had second, third chances.

23:58.042 --> 24:02.042
"Come back in here, Joseph.
I was just joking.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.380
I thought you were the comedian."

24:11.292 --> 24:13.382
And I moved back in at 29.

24:14.208 --> 24:17.998
And then I moved out again at 32.
But fuck it. That's what boys do.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.208
Shit. My sisters never got
a second chance.

24:23.292 --> 24:26.132
Once they were gone, that was it.
She didn't give a shit.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.288
"Bye."

24:28.375 --> 24:29.955
Don't even call me.

24:31.958 --> 24:34.498
You think you can do it?
Oh, go. Do it.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.495
"It's cold out there, huh?"

24:39.417 --> 24:42.707
My sisters would get into epic fights
with my mom.

24:42.792 --> 24:45.462
Like, some of the shit they would say...
Unbelievable.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.832
I remember watching those fights
when I was a kid.

24:47.917 --> 24:51.287
My sister Rowena, especially.
Holy shit. Every weekend.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.915
"Mom, I'm going out with my friend.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.934
Why do you always question me
every time I go out with my friend?"

24:54.958 --> 24:57.288
"Yeah. Because every weekend,
it's a different guy."

24:57.375 --> 25:00.143
"Yeah, Mom, it's called dating.
I'm dating people. I'm allowed to do that."

25:00.167 --> 25:02.018
I don't go to school anymore.
I make my own money.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.434
"I want to go out and date and have fun.
Is that a big deal?"

25:04.458 --> 25:05.958
"Yeah, but you go out every weekend,

25:06.042 --> 25:08.252
just gallivanting with different people
all the time."

25:08.333 --> 25:10.059
"They're not different people!
They're my friends!"

25:10.083 --> 25:12.018
"Sure, they're you're friends.
They're just people out there."

25:12.042 --> 25:14.382
You're giving your <i>pekpek </i> away
to everybody!

25:14.458 --> 25:16.226
You don't even know them.
Who wants <i>pekpek? </i> You want <i>pekpek?</i>

25:16.250 --> 25:19.040
"That's a <i>pekpek </i> for you.
You want it? There! It's for free!"

25:22.500 --> 25:24.040
<i>"Pekpek"</i> is "pussy."

25:27.625 --> 25:28.851
There's some people that got it,

25:28.875 --> 25:31.195
but then there's some, like,
"Is she giving chickens away?"

25:32.125 --> 25:34.825
Every weekend, she has a chicken
and she gives it away?

25:34.917 --> 25:36.287
"That's expensive."

25:38.833 --> 25:43.173
But now they made up.
Now they're friends. Best of friends.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.790
Seeing my mom and sister make up:
Funniest shit ever.

25:46.583 --> 25:50.173
Just seeing my mom cry.
"I just want you to know that...

25:50.250 --> 25:53.630
I didn't think you gave your <i>pekpek </i> away
to everybody."

25:56.792 --> 26:00.292
"Well, I didn't, Mom. It's right here.
It's the same one you gave me."

26:02.750 --> 26:05.460
Man, I get it, Mom.
God bless you. That shit is hard.

26:05.542 --> 26:09.292
My son's 13, and it just keeps getting
harder and harder.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.915
It's so hard.

26:11.958 --> 26:14.458
My son is in the seventh grade.
God damn it.

26:15.292 --> 26:17.962
I want all you new parents
to know this right now.

26:18.042 --> 26:21.752
When you were in the seventh grade
and you weren't smart,

26:23.083 --> 26:26.833
you're definitely not gonna be smart
when your kid gets to the seventh grade.

26:27.667 --> 26:28.877
It's harder.

26:30.042 --> 26:32.632
My son and I are failing Math.

26:37.458 --> 26:38.998
It's so hard.

26:40.083 --> 26:44.293
Now he's getting a C-minus in Math.
C-minus in Math.

26:45.292 --> 26:49.752
In private school, that's not good.
That's failing Math.

26:49.833 --> 26:52.713
So, of course, she brings in
for a parent-teacher meeting.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.332
Private school. That's what they do.

26:54.417 --> 26:57.327
They sit you down
because they're concerned.

27:01.917 --> 27:06.707
"Hi. Mr. Koy, please sit down."

27:06.792 --> 27:09.882
I don't want to startle you.
I want to nip this in the bud.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.040
Just want you to know, Mr. Koy,
that your son has a C-minus in Math.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.165
Uh-oh.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.040
Uh-oh.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.625
That's not good.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.787
What are we gonna do
to solve that, Mr. Koy?

27:25.875 --> 27:27.955
You need to help me help him.

27:28.042 --> 27:30.292
I can do whatever I can
over here at school,

27:30.375 --> 27:32.665
but when he gets home,
you need to crack open that book

27:32.750 --> 27:36.130
and start working on those questions
with your son.

27:36.208 --> 27:39.538
Let's bring that grade back up.
Let's do this as a team, Mr. Koy.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.955
"Come on!"

27:49.458 --> 27:53.168
And I was, like,
"You know I'm a comedian, right?"

27:54.458 --> 27:58.748
And I hired you to teach my son math.

27:59.917 --> 28:00.917
Uh-oh.

28:02.542 --> 28:03.672
Uh-oh.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.457
What are we gonna do to fix that?

28:08.167 --> 28:12.327
"Sounds like you owe me money."

28:16.958 --> 28:19.788
If you have kids,
take them to public school.

28:20.625 --> 28:23.285
That's the only...
Public school, please.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.503
I'm paying college tuition
for my son's seventh-grade education.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.737
And then I get a call from the principal.
"Mr. Koy, you forgot to pay your milk fee.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.167
You forgot to pay your milk fee, Mr. Koy."

28:35.250 --> 28:38.710
I go, "I paid the tuition
I thought it was included in the tuition."

28:38.792 --> 28:40.922
"No, Mr. Koy, that's separate."

28:45.625 --> 28:48.455
I got so mad.
I was filling out that paperwork,

28:48.542 --> 28:51.559
and I just looked at myself. I go,
"I can't believe I'm filling out paperwork

28:51.583 --> 28:52.883
to pay for milk."

28:54.500 --> 28:55.768
He goes,
"What are you talking about, Dad?"

28:55.792 --> 28:59.672
I go, "When I filled out paperwork,
it was so I could get free milk."

29:02.042 --> 29:03.422
We were poor, Joe.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.173
We couldn't afford milk,

29:06.250 --> 29:09.040
so my mom filled out paperwork
so we could get a free milk.

29:09.125 --> 29:12.535
I couldn't wait to get to school
so I could actually taste calcium.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.625
"And it's delicious when it's free."

29:18.708 --> 29:19.976
He didn't know what a free milk was,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.380
so I had to explain to him
what a free milk looked like.

29:22.458 --> 29:24.628
I go, "Joe, a free milk
was a carton of milk"

29:24.708 --> 29:26.538
that looked like a house from <i>Monopoly.</i>

29:28.042 --> 29:31.462
And it had three simple instructions.
You pulled the right side to the right,

29:31.542 --> 29:32.882
the left side to the left,

29:32.958 --> 29:35.538
and then you pinched the middle
and pulled it towards your chest,

29:35.625 --> 29:37.785
and it's supposed to make a spout.

29:37.875 --> 29:40.035
But it never made a fucking spout.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.997
So, you turned it to the back
and started over.

29:47.917 --> 29:51.037
That side had too much glue.
You couldn't even open that fucking side.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.434
So you just ripped it open in the middle.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.828
Now you're drinking milk
out of a square box.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.713
And when you were done with that milk,
you put soil in it and a bean,

30:02.792 --> 30:04.292
"and you grew a tree."

30:05.250 --> 30:06.920
Yeah. Public school.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.457
I gotta get my son to be humble.

30:15.542 --> 30:18.882
How is my son gonna be humble
when I've been driving him to school?

30:18.958 --> 30:22.248
His whole school career,
he's been chauffeured to school.

30:22.333 --> 30:26.673
He's never been on a bus before.
That shit will make you humble.

30:26.750 --> 30:31.670
Go to a school on a public bus.
He's doesn't even know what a public bus...

30:31.750 --> 30:34.540
I just found out my son doesn't know
what a school bus is.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.625
We were driving on the freeway,
and school bus passed us,

30:37.708 --> 30:40.038
and my son goes like this:
"Where are they going?"

30:47.042 --> 30:49.042
"Fucking school, asshole."

30:51.000 --> 30:52.330
"Who's this dick?"

30:59.667 --> 31:02.787
He's been going to school...
You gotta go to school on a bus.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.915
That shit will make you humble.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.130
Go to school on a bus with a bunch of kids
that hate their fucking life.

31:09.208 --> 31:11.788
That was me. I hated my life.

31:11.875 --> 31:15.035
I was the last kid on,
and I was the last kid off.

31:15.125 --> 31:18.535
Hated that shit. Every time I got on,
there was only one seat left,

31:18.625 --> 31:21.575
and there was always that one kid
that didn't want to share the seat.

31:21.667 --> 31:22.747
And I'd walk up to him.

31:22.833 --> 31:26.083
He's, like, "You better not even think
about sitting here."

31:27.542 --> 31:30.042
And I'd go, "Where am I supposed to sit?"

31:31.833 --> 31:33.673
"I don't fucking care."

31:36.208 --> 31:38.078
And the bus driver doesn't give a shit.

31:38.167 --> 31:41.167
"You'd better sit down back there."
"I don't know where to sit.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.245
He's not gonna let me sit down.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.753
She's getting mad.
She's not gonna go unless I sit down.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.793
I won't even sit on the whole thing.

31:56.750 --> 32:00.290
"Just let me... let me sit on the edge."

32:00.375 --> 32:04.415
I had to sit on the edge
and then hold the seat across the aisle.

32:06.250 --> 32:09.000
I went to school
looking like I took a shit on the bus.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.380
And then he'd still fuck with me.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.583
"Why do you smell like Vicks?"

32:24.333 --> 32:26.673
"Because I have pneumonia."

32:34.542 --> 32:35.832
He's got it so good.

32:37.208 --> 32:41.038
I've got to stop spoiling him.
I spoil him too much.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.325
It sucks.

32:43.708 --> 32:46.601
But the reason I spoil him is because
I didn't have shit when I was a kid.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.535
We were broke as shit.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.165
And now that I can afford it,
I'm buying everything.

32:51.250 --> 32:55.080
And yes, it's for him, but he doesn't know
that it's actually for us.

32:56.167 --> 33:01.667
All that cool shit he has, I want it, too.
I want it so bad.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.210
This Christmas pissed me off.

33:03.292 --> 33:05.672
I go, "Joe, you want a PS4 for Christmas?"
He goes, "No."

33:05.750 --> 33:07.420
I go, "Why the fuck not?"

33:09.292 --> 33:11.002
"You're selfish, bro."

33:16.250 --> 33:19.290
I want all that shit.
I want all those toys.

33:19.375 --> 33:23.205
And I'm holding back, but it's hard.
It's so damn hard.

33:23.875 --> 33:27.575
We went to the mall. This was, like,
seven months ago, eight months ago.

33:27.667 --> 33:31.037
And the kiosk with the hoverboards.

33:31.125 --> 33:34.575
Oh, shit. And my son got on it
like a fucking natural.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.287
He just got on and was, like,
"Oh, my God. Dad."

33:38.167 --> 33:39.247
Dad.

33:40.667 --> 33:42.037
Dad!

33:43.417 --> 33:48.457
"Dad! I've got to have this, Dad.
I've got to have this."

33:48.542 --> 33:50.684
And I just looked at him,
and this is what I said in my head.

33:50.708 --> 33:52.878
I go, "Yes, we do."

33:55.000 --> 33:57.380
But I was being a good dad.

33:57.458 --> 33:59.708
I was, like, "No.
I can't buy that for you."

33:59.792 --> 34:03.252
He goes, "Why not?"
I go, "Because you have a C-minus in Math,

34:03.333 --> 34:05.083
and I can't reward you for that.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.246
"Bring the grade up to a B,
and I'll buy it for you."

34:08.333 --> 34:10.333
My son goes like this:
"Are you serious right now?"

34:11.333 --> 34:14.833
And this is what I said, I swear to God.
I went like this: "I know, right?"

34:19.125 --> 34:21.495
"Why'd you fail the test, man?"

34:22.375 --> 34:24.875
We both left that mall
just fucking crying.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.672
I wanted that hoverboard so bad.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.292
And then I told him,
"Joe, I'll buy you that hoverboard."

34:32.375 --> 34:35.284
I'm gonna get you a tutor,
and she's gonna help you with your math.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.074
"You bring the grade up, it's done."

34:37.167 --> 34:38.456
So, I get the tutor.

34:39.792 --> 34:43.132
This is how shitty of a dad I am.
Just for one week with the tutor,

34:43.208 --> 34:46.378
he has a quiz the following week.
Four out of five right.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.418
Doesn't even apply to the grade.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.330
And I just looked at him like this:
"Look at you, Einstein."

34:53.375 --> 34:56.245
"Looks like we need to go to the mall
and get something, don't we?"

35:00.125 --> 35:03.745
And I got that hoverboard.
Oh, I fucking love that thing.

35:04.625 --> 35:05.825
I ride it every morning.

35:11.625 --> 35:12.785
"You want cereal?"

35:15.042 --> 35:16.322
"Yes, Dad."
"I'll be right back."

35:22.375 --> 35:26.875
I crashed on that hoverboard. Holy shit.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.288
I got wood floors at my house.

35:28.375 --> 35:30.165
This is what it sounded like
when I crashed.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.750
Twice, because I skipped across the floor.

35:36.292 --> 35:39.042
And this is how old I am. When I finally
landed, this is what I said.

35:39.125 --> 35:40.415
I went, "Uhh!"

35:42.042 --> 35:43.502
Oh, fucking hip!

35:45.000 --> 35:47.540
"Oh, my fucking hip! It's broken!"

35:48.417 --> 35:50.167
And my son doesn't give two shits
about me.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.580
He came around the corner
and went like this: "Dad?"

35:52.667 --> 35:54.247
Where's my hoverboard?"

35:59.542 --> 36:00.962
"Fuck you, Joe.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.168
Fuck you."

36:07.625 --> 36:09.665
Don't buy that hoverboard.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.518
I don't even know why
they sell it in America.

36:11.542 --> 36:15.502
I don't know how they got past inspection.
They're dangerous.

36:16.458 --> 36:19.128
When the battery's dead,
it doesn't even tell you.

36:23.250 --> 36:26.290
I swear to God, it just stops mid-ride.

36:26.375 --> 36:29.495
And then it catapults you across
the living room at 17 miles per hour.

36:30.458 --> 36:34.208
I'm flying through the air with
a bowl of cereal, like, "What the fuck?!"

36:34.958 --> 36:35.998
Shit!"

36:42.083 --> 36:45.963
Thirteen. God damn it.
They grow fast, you guys.

36:46.042 --> 36:49.632
He's at that age where he doesn't want
to kiss me anymore. It makes me so sad.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.378
I hate it. "Have a good day at school."
He's like this: "All right."

36:56.625 --> 36:57.745
And I...

37:08.708 --> 37:11.788
I don't know what to do now.
Turning into a man.

37:11.875 --> 37:14.643
I don't like the way God tells you
that your son is turning into a man.

37:14.667 --> 37:19.287
It's too quick. I'm not even
mentally prepared for this.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.351
I found out last year
that he's turning into a man.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.375
It sucked. Last year...
This is when I found out.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.628
He was in the pool, swimming,
and I'm on the outside of the pool,

37:27.708 --> 37:30.248
just watching my son swim.
He comes out of the pool.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.309
This is what he says to me, word-for-word,
when he comes out of the pool.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.293
He went like this:
"This pubic hair is tickling my butt."

37:45.000 --> 37:48.170
And when he said "pubic hair,"
he meant one pubic hair.

37:49.792 --> 37:53.792
Just one. It's so long,
it's tickling his asshole.

37:56.417 --> 37:59.537
And I started crying.
I go, "Why do you have a pubic hair?"

38:01.042 --> 38:02.332
"Why?"

38:02.417 --> 38:06.247
And that's it. That's it.
The pube is here.

38:07.125 --> 38:11.035
That was last year. He's 13 now.
How many does he have now, 20?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.880
I'm not ready for that.
No more toys anymore.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.958
No more of the cute toys
he used to play with when he was 11, 12.

38:20.042 --> 38:22.672
Transformers,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles... fuck that.

38:22.750 --> 38:24.330
He's got a new toy.

38:24.417 --> 38:27.917
He's got a new toy that he's gonna love
to play with a lot more.

38:32.625 --> 38:35.455
He's probably gonna play with it
in front of the old toys.

38:39.875 --> 38:43.705
And there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm not prepared for that. My son?

38:43.792 --> 38:46.172
Now! This is when it starts!

38:46.958 --> 38:49.248
Thirteen. This is when it starts.

38:49.333 --> 38:52.173
Shit! And I'm gonna catch him.

38:53.042 --> 38:56.792
I'm gonna catch him. It's inevitable.
I'm gonna catch my son jerking off.

38:56.875 --> 38:59.625
Are you kidding me?
And what do I say to him when I catch him?

38:59.708 --> 39:02.878
I don't even know what to say to him.
What do I say? "Stop doing that"?

39:02.958 --> 39:05.668
That's fucked up. I'm still doing that!

39:09.417 --> 39:10.997
Who the fuck am I?

39:11.083 --> 39:13.423
"Only one guy jerks off in this house."

39:14.208 --> 39:16.578
And since I own it,
take your little dick outside.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.878
"This is <i>my </i> lotion."

39:24.292 --> 39:28.252
He's gonna get caught.
Because boys are sloppy with their work.

39:29.292 --> 39:31.934
They're sloppy with their work,
and you know what I'm talking about.

39:31.958 --> 39:34.208
They just...
They don't know what to fucking do.

39:34.833 --> 39:35.833
Thirteen?

39:44.583 --> 39:47.543
I was the creepiest. When I was 13? Shit.

39:47.625 --> 39:49.785
Thirteen... I could eat cereal, jerk off,

39:49.875 --> 39:52.955
watch cartoons and look out for my mom
at the same time.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.502
Just creepy shit.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.382
"Aah! Shit!"

40:18.542 --> 40:19.752
It's gross.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.080
It's gross, but it's life. This is it.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.377
I'm gonna catch him. Fuck.

40:27.583 --> 40:30.503
He's gonna be so creepy.
Boys are creepy with their work.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.705
They don't know.
The first times that they do it,

40:33.792 --> 40:36.632
the first 20 times, nothing comes out,
ladies. You do know that, right?

40:36.708 --> 40:38.878
It's just you and your friend at a party.

40:40.292 --> 40:43.212
And then your friend starts to dry-heave
for no reason.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.830
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:55.542 --> 40:56.922
Yeah!

41:00.125 --> 41:04.955
And that's why we get caught.
Because we think that happens every time.

41:05.042 --> 41:06.042
And it's not.

41:06.125 --> 41:09.705
One day, something comes out,
and we don't know what to fucking do.

41:09.792 --> 41:11.226
It catches us off guard.
We're, like...

41:11.250 --> 41:12.420
Blam!

41:12.500 --> 41:13.540
"Aah!"

41:15.167 --> 41:17.037
No, no, no, no!

41:18.000 --> 41:21.250
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

41:21.333 --> 41:25.083
No, no! No!

41:25.167 --> 41:27.327
Oh, my God!

41:29.375 --> 41:31.375
"I'm ready for church!"

41:35.500 --> 41:38.170
You go to church with a come-print
on your chest.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.327
I want every woman to know this right now.
We don't stop.

41:46.625 --> 41:50.375
We don't stop, all right? I didn't stop.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.753
Been doing it since I was a kid.
I got caught by my mom.

41:54.583 --> 41:56.503
My mom caught me. Worst day of my life.

41:57.625 --> 42:01.075
Worst day of my... And I don't like
how quiet it is in this room right now.

42:02.083 --> 42:05.043
I really don't. I don't like how
every guy is looking at like:

42:05.125 --> 42:07.075
"This is kind of disgusting."

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I don't know what he's talking about.

42:11.292 --> 42:13.832
"How could he get caught by his mother?"

42:13.917 --> 42:16.207
I want every guy in this room
to know this tonight.

42:16.292 --> 42:20.462
You got caught by your mom, too.
She caught your dumb ass.

42:20.542 --> 42:24.832
She saw it. That's a grown woman.
She knows what her teenaged son is doing.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.627
She just never said anything
to your dumb ass.

42:27.708 --> 42:31.498
But she found it. Whatever it was
you were abusing, she found it.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.023
She just didn't tell you about it.
She was cleaning your room.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.393
And she was, like,
"Oh, let me get that plate."

42:38.417 --> 42:40.377
Oh, that's not a plate.

42:42.583 --> 42:43.753
"That's a towel."

42:54.917 --> 42:58.827
She just... She didn't say anything to you.
My mom said something to me,

42:58.917 --> 43:01.247
because that's the kind of
fucking mom I got.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.958
But I thought I was bulletproof.

43:05.042 --> 43:07.962
Sock. Genius. Sock.

43:08.792 --> 43:11.172
Sock, hamper. Sock, hamper.

43:11.250 --> 43:13.080
All week. Sock, hamper.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.882
Sock, hamper.

43:15.958 --> 43:18.748
Two a day Friday.
Sock, sock, hamper, hamper.

43:20.875 --> 43:23.125
Then Sunday came around.
My mom walked into my room.

43:23.208 --> 43:24.828
"Stop fucking your socks."

43:26.458 --> 43:28.378
Are you kidding me right now?

43:29.250 --> 43:32.460
You want me to clean it? Fuck you, Joseph.

43:32.542 --> 43:35.542
That's disgusting.
I've been throwing all your socks away.

43:36.458 --> 43:38.918
You have two pair of socks left
for the rest of the year.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.130
You fuck those... no more socks, Joseph.

43:42.208 --> 43:44.828
You're gonna go to school
barefoot like that, huh?

43:45.583 --> 43:47.851
The principal will call me.
'Joseph doesn't have any socks.'

43:47.875 --> 43:51.035
"'Yeah, because he keeps fucking them!'"

44:03.667 --> 44:05.247
We all do it. We all do it.

44:06.417 --> 44:08.577
Every guy in here still does it.

44:08.667 --> 44:11.827
It's creepy. We'll move on from this,
but I just want to keep going.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.535
We've got plenty of time to kill.

44:15.458 --> 44:18.748
Every guy does it, though.
We haven't stopped.

44:18.833 --> 44:20.213
We become better at it.

44:22.833 --> 44:25.043
We don't stop because we're creeps,
ladies.

44:25.792 --> 44:27.542
We're just creepy people.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.518
I don't care how long
you've been with your man...

44:29.542 --> 44:33.002
Five years, ten years, five days...
It doesn't matter.

44:33.083 --> 44:34.333
That's his shit.

44:36.792 --> 44:38.462
I want every woman to know this:

44:38.542 --> 44:42.632
The creepiest man in this room tonight
is the guy you came with.

44:44.208 --> 44:47.578
I swear to God.
There's no one creepier in this room.

44:47.667 --> 44:50.577
Don't look across the aisle
or up in the balcony.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.167
He's sitting right fucking next to you.

44:53.250 --> 44:57.170
That guy is a creepy, creepy fuck.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.878
Don't give it to her for a couple days.
Watch him just, "Uhh!"

45:02.958 --> 45:05.208
I don't care how good-looking your man is.

45:05.292 --> 45:07.292
When we jerk off, we all look the same.

45:09.125 --> 45:11.325
Creepy. By ourselves.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.327
One shoe on. Always one shoe on.

45:14.958 --> 45:16.918
Look at the toe! Look at the fucking toe!

45:18.208 --> 45:19.998
Shirt tucked under the chin.

45:22.333 --> 45:26.083
Shirt tucked under the chin.
Did you know that, ladies?

45:26.167 --> 45:28.537
Did you know your man tucks the shirt
under his chin?

45:28.625 --> 45:30.165
You want to know why?

45:30.250 --> 45:33.960
Because he doesn't want
the bottom of the shirt to touch his dick,

45:34.042 --> 45:37.042
because he's still gonna wear that shirt
for the rest of the day.

45:41.042 --> 45:43.712
Creepy fucker's gonna wear
his jerk-off shirt

45:43.792 --> 45:45.132
to the comedy show tonight.

45:55.583 --> 45:57.633
Don't shake anyone's hand in here tonight.

45:59.542 --> 46:02.792
I swear to God,
the diversity in this room is amazing.

46:07.292 --> 46:09.212
I will tell you this right now.

46:09.292 --> 46:12.092
I'm just gonna be honest with you guys.
I'm gonna put it all out there.

46:12.125 --> 46:15.705
No one is more indirectly racist
than Filipino moms.

46:21.125 --> 46:22.785
My sister's about to marry her fiancé.

46:22.875 --> 46:25.075
He's dark. He's dark. Darker than you.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.293
My sister got the darkest one.

46:29.500 --> 46:31.960
There's black, and then there's nighttime.

46:33.792 --> 46:35.462
Andre is nighttime.

46:36.167 --> 46:38.627
Andre used to kill it in hide-and-seek
when he was a kid.

46:39.958 --> 46:42.328
Didn't even have to hide.
Just closed his eyes like that.

46:43.250 --> 46:46.630
"Where are you, Andre?"
"Right here, motherfuckers.

46:46.708 --> 46:48.378
I win again."

46:49.375 --> 46:53.375
You should've seen how my mom acted
when she met Andre for the first time.

46:53.458 --> 46:55.538
When he walked into the house,
my mom went like this.

47:03.625 --> 47:06.075
"Put my purse in the room.
Put my purse in the room."

47:10.375 --> 47:12.785
I got so mad at my mom.

47:12.875 --> 47:15.955
I took her to the kitchen.
I was, like, "Mom, are you kidding me?"

47:16.042 --> 47:19.172
Just because he's black, you want me
to put your purse in the room?

47:19.250 --> 47:20.790
"Are you kidding me right now?"

47:20.875 --> 47:25.665
And then she got mad at me
and made <i>me </i> feel like the racist.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.920
Some Filipino Jedi shit.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.761
She just looked at me and goes,
"Oh, just because he's black, Joseph,"

47:31.833 --> 47:33.883
and I told you to put my purse
in the room,

47:33.958 --> 47:36.458
you think your mother is a racist?

47:37.667 --> 47:39.497
Wow, Joseph.

47:40.250 --> 47:41.670
Wow.

47:42.542 --> 47:44.082
Wow.

47:45.708 --> 47:48.078
I would do that with any stranger, Joseph.

47:48.167 --> 47:51.577
White, black, Latino, Asian.
I don't care.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.997
If I don't know you,
put my purse in the room.

47:55.750 --> 47:57.290
"That's a Louis Vuitton."

47:59.417 --> 48:02.787
I go, "Mom, you know what you did.
Stop right now."

48:02.875 --> 48:05.245
You're making Andre feel
very uncomfortable."

48:05.333 --> 48:08.423
And my mom looked at and goes,
"I'm not making him feel uncomfortable."

48:08.500 --> 48:12.080
You are. Bringing me into the kitchen
to talk to me.

48:12.167 --> 48:13.957
Are you kidding me right now?

48:14.042 --> 48:17.002
I'm doing everything to make Andre
feel comfortable.

48:17.833 --> 48:20.383
"I'm frying chicken,
I put basketball on the TV."

48:29.375 --> 48:31.745
"Out of everything
you could've cooked tonight,

48:32.958 --> 48:35.128
you decided to fry chicken."

48:35.208 --> 48:38.038
"Joseph, they love chicken."

48:39.583 --> 48:40.583
They love...

48:41.583 --> 48:43.793
"They love chicken, Joseph."

48:45.375 --> 48:48.415
Right when I said that,
Andre walked into the kitchen.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.250
He's, like, "Oh, I'm sorry."

48:53.458 --> 48:56.578
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know y'all was in the kitchen.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.420
"Quick question: Are y'all frying chicken?"

49:04.458 --> 49:08.998
And my mom goes, "Yes, Andre.
We're... We're frying chicken."

49:10.292 --> 49:12.832
But if you don't like chicken, I can...

49:12.917 --> 49:14.877
I can cook something else, if...

49:15.750 --> 49:18.080
"If you don't like chicken."

49:26.292 --> 49:30.082
And Andre was, like,
"Oh, no, no. I love chicken.

49:31.167 --> 49:32.577
I eat it every day."

49:34.917 --> 49:36.707
And then he walked out of the kitchen.

49:38.083 --> 49:40.083
And then my mom looked at me
and went like this:

49:41.000 --> 49:42.420
"I told you."

49:51.000 --> 49:53.790
That's a very racist...

49:53.875 --> 49:56.245
Right? That's racist. Right, black guy?

49:58.917 --> 50:03.167
That's a racist... You want to hear
the most racist part about that story?

50:03.917 --> 50:05.957
Andre doesn't talk like that.

50:10.250 --> 50:15.750
I gave Andre an '80s black rapper voice
because it's funnier.

50:16.583 --> 50:18.383
If you ever meet Andre,
he talks like this:

50:18.458 --> 50:19.828
"Hello. My name is Andre."

50:21.375 --> 50:24.825
I made him talk... "I love chicken!"
Who the fuck talks like that?

50:24.917 --> 50:26.976
I've never even met a black guy
that talks about chicken like,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.768
"I love chicken, I eat it every day.

50:28.792 --> 50:31.082
I eat that chicken in every kind of way."

50:42.625 --> 50:45.915
She's getting married.
My sister's getting married. Shit.

50:46.750 --> 50:49.460
That's good, right?
How long have you guys been together?

50:49.542 --> 50:50.922
Eighteen years.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.460
Eighteen years? Goddamn.

50:53.542 --> 50:56.292
Eighteen strong years.
You got kids? Two kids?

50:56.375 --> 50:58.625
How old are the kids. Eighteen and what?

51:07.458 --> 51:09.248
Did you watch the baby come out?

51:11.042 --> 51:13.292
Did you watch the baby come out?
You better, man.

51:13.375 --> 51:14.875
You've got to watch that shit.

51:17.417 --> 51:20.127
That's why a lot of you guys out there...

51:20.208 --> 51:21.878
If you don't pay your child support,

51:21.958 --> 51:24.748
I want you to start thinking
about what happened that day.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.877
And remember,
that shit costs a lot of money.

51:29.833 --> 51:32.293
I give my ex whatever the fuck she wants.

51:32.375 --> 51:35.995
I saw that baby come out.
Fuck that shit.

51:39.042 --> 51:42.172
And a lot of you women
need to be more graphic with these guys

51:42.250 --> 51:43.770
that ain't paying their child support.

51:43.833 --> 51:46.543
Let them hear. Stop being nice about it.

51:46.625 --> 51:48.665
"Your daughter wants
to take ballet classes."

51:48.750 --> 51:51.460
She needs shoes and some lessons.

51:51.542 --> 51:55.752
"Your son wants to play sports.
He needs cleats and some gear."

51:56.750 --> 51:59.960
Fuck that. Be graphic.
"Why do I want extra money?"

52:00.042 --> 52:03.132
Because those kids ripped my pussy apart.

52:05.333 --> 52:08.383
Ripped. Ripped.

52:08.458 --> 52:10.788
"Ripped it. Ripped."

52:17.083 --> 52:19.383
It doesn't stay like that.

52:19.458 --> 52:21.559
I don't want you to think it's ripped
and stays like that.

52:21.583 --> 52:24.018
That's the cool thing about the vagina.
It comes back together.

52:24.042 --> 52:27.212
It's fucking... It's like a Transformer.

52:28.125 --> 52:29.745
It's like Pussimus Prime.

52:30.625 --> 52:31.665
It's like Babybots.

52:33.250 --> 52:35.250
What the fuck?!

52:46.958 --> 52:49.498
I saw that baby come out.
Fuck that shit.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.253
The vagina is beautiful,
just not that day.

52:53.375 --> 52:55.165
That day, it's its evil twin.

52:56.208 --> 52:58.578
It's not even vagina.
It's called "va-gina."

52:59.792 --> 53:01.042
"I am Va-gina."

53:01.833 --> 53:03.923
I'm delivering a baby.

53:05.042 --> 53:06.632
Push, baby.

53:07.292 --> 53:09.542
Oh, come on. I'm Va-gina.

53:09.625 --> 53:13.035
Push! Oh, here comes the baby!

53:13.125 --> 53:15.535
Oh, here comes the baby!

53:15.625 --> 53:17.285
"Oh, baby!"

53:23.125 --> 53:25.955
My son's head was hanging out like this.

53:26.042 --> 53:27.559
And then she coughed,
and he went back in.

53:27.583 --> 53:29.383
I was, like, "Oh, shit!"

53:33.000 --> 53:35.130
"Her pussy just ate the baby!"

53:37.667 --> 53:40.787
I just remember my son going, "Dad!"

53:47.417 --> 53:51.037
Dating. Dating, right?
It's rough, right? Shit.

53:51.125 --> 53:54.415
Here's the thing about dating.
All you need is just to be secure.

53:54.500 --> 53:58.580
Just be secure and your girl
is gonna fucking love you.

53:58.667 --> 54:01.457
Stop being insecure.
The minute you're insecure

54:01.542 --> 54:04.252
and start questioning her,
it fucking turns her off.

54:04.333 --> 54:06.559
Don't question her every time she goes out
with her girlfriends.

54:06.583 --> 54:07.833
"Where are you going?"

54:07.917 --> 54:10.747
"I'm going out with my girlfriends.
I told you that already."

54:11.542 --> 54:13.422
"Okay, what time are you gonna be home?"

54:14.333 --> 54:16.923
"I don't know. Maybe later.
I don't know. What the fuck?

54:17.000 --> 54:21.210
Seriously? Do I do this shit with you
on your fucking guys' night out?"

54:22.125 --> 54:23.765
"I'm just saying. I just want to know..."

54:26.500 --> 54:30.790
They hate that shit.
Just be secure and let her fucking go.

54:30.875 --> 54:33.995
That turns a girl on.
Ignore her. She loves that shit.

54:35.042 --> 54:38.132
It pisses her off,
and she loves it at the same time.

54:38.208 --> 54:42.418
When you don't call her the whole time.
It even confuses her when she leaves.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.540
"I'm going out with my girls."
"All right, see you."

54:45.167 --> 54:47.127
"But are you gonna ask where..."

54:50.375 --> 54:52.205
"No. Just go with your girls."

54:52.292 --> 54:54.082
"All right. That's crazy."

54:56.333 --> 54:59.043
Don't call her the whole night.
Just ignore her.

54:59.125 --> 55:00.875
She'll be at the club, freaking out.

55:01.833 --> 55:04.463
Just fucking dancing,
looking at her phone.

55:04.542 --> 55:05.792
"What the fuck?"

55:13.375 --> 55:15.125
That shit turns her on.

55:16.417 --> 55:20.037
Because guys get mad at girls
when they go out with their girlfriends.

55:20.125 --> 55:22.125
Stop being insecure. Fuck it.

55:22.208 --> 55:23.976
If she goes out with her friends,
she goes out with her friends.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.880
And the guys always get mad.
"Yeah, but every time she goes out,

55:26.958 --> 55:29.538
guys buy her drinks,
and then she fucking takes them."

55:29.625 --> 55:32.955
No shit! They're free, asshole.

55:33.833 --> 55:36.173
Wouldn't you take a goddamn drink
for free?

55:36.250 --> 55:38.393
If a girl walked up to you...
"Hey, I'd like to buy you a drink,"

55:38.417 --> 55:40.207
you'd be, like, "What the fuck?"

55:41.333 --> 55:43.423
Can you buy my friends some?"

55:46.792 --> 55:49.882
And if a guy is buying
your chick at the club a drink,

55:49.958 --> 55:53.208
that means she's one of
the hottest chicks in the fucking club.

55:53.292 --> 55:55.462
So you should proud of that shit.

55:55.542 --> 55:57.462
And don't get mad at her
for getting free drinks.

55:57.542 --> 55:59.422
That's her hustle. She's hot,

55:59.500 --> 56:03.040
and she's getting free drinks
from a dude at a club.

56:03.125 --> 56:05.665
You don't have to worry about it
because she has your back.

56:05.750 --> 56:08.080
Every girl that has a man
and she's at a club

56:08.167 --> 56:09.457
has her dude's back.

56:09.542 --> 56:11.502
Swear to God.
And you know what I'm talking about.

56:11.583 --> 56:16.133
She'll keep getting those drinks for free.
She'll get them, as many as she can.

56:16.208 --> 56:17.351
"I'm gonna drink free all night."

56:17.375 --> 56:19.601
And then, when that question comes:
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

56:19.625 --> 56:21.995
"Yeah, he's at home.
His name's John. He's black. Bye!"

56:24.833 --> 56:28.213
"Bye. Bye! Thank you!"

56:30.833 --> 56:32.383
Because that's what women do.

56:32.458 --> 56:35.248
They get your back,
and you know what I'm talking about.

56:35.333 --> 56:38.213
Every guy's bought drinks for a girl
that had a guy, and you know it.

56:38.292 --> 56:40.809
They drop it on you at the last second
because that's what women do.

56:40.833 --> 56:43.226
So, don't get mad at your girl
when she goes out with these guys.

56:43.250 --> 56:46.170
Let them go. Let them have
as many drinks as they want.

56:46.250 --> 56:48.920
Let them fucking get tore the fuck up.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.420
As many drinks. Let her get them.
As many drinks.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.790
"Thank you. Thank you."

56:53.875 --> 56:57.165
All fucking night.
She's gonna get fucked up.

56:57.250 --> 57:00.380
And then she's gonna come home drunk,

57:00.458 --> 57:02.788
and then she's gonna want
to suck your dick...

57:04.292 --> 57:05.832
on his tab!

57:06.792 --> 57:08.422
"What the fuck?

57:09.292 --> 57:11.252
This blowjob is free?!"

57:16.583 --> 57:19.213
Stop being insecure. Let them go.

57:19.292 --> 57:21.962
In fact, when your girl goes out,
you go out.

57:22.042 --> 57:25.172
Don't stay at home. Go get fucked up, too.

57:25.250 --> 57:29.500
That's the best sex you'll ever have.
You both ignore each other all night,

57:29.583 --> 57:31.633
you both get fucked up
with your own friends,

57:31.708 --> 57:34.038
and then you both come home
drunk as shit.

57:34.125 --> 57:35.995
That's the funniest shit.

57:36.875 --> 57:38.785
And the guy's always the first one home.

57:49.375 --> 57:50.415
"Babe!"

57:52.125 --> 57:53.125
"Babe!"

57:53.958 --> 57:55.578
Nobody's home.

57:56.583 --> 57:59.143
Then, all of a sudden, she walks
through the door, drunk as shit.

58:02.083 --> 58:03.423
"Hi, baby."

58:04.792 --> 58:06.962
She's limping because she has one heel on.

58:09.792 --> 58:11.172
"Hi, baby."

58:12.208 --> 58:13.288
"Hi, babe."

58:14.833 --> 58:16.043
"Hi, babe."

58:16.125 --> 58:17.415
"Hi, baby."

58:19.500 --> 58:22.500
"Why didn't you text me all night?"

58:23.500 --> 58:25.670
"I didn't know where my phone was."

58:26.625 --> 58:28.535
It's a fucking square right here.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.542
That turns her on.

58:33.625 --> 58:36.035
"Your phone is right there, you stupid."

58:37.042 --> 58:39.002
Your phone's right there, stupid.

58:39.833 --> 58:42.173
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

58:43.708 --> 58:46.248
They're drunk and horny.
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.

58:46.333 --> 58:48.463
I swear to God.
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

58:48.542 --> 58:51.212
And then he's, like,
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

58:51.292 --> 58:54.582
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

58:54.667 --> 58:57.957
Then you guys walk towards each other,
about to fuck each other,

58:58.042 --> 58:59.332
but it's not even cute.

58:59.417 --> 59:02.077
It just looks like two zombies
about to fuck each other.

59:02.167 --> 59:04.077
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

59:04.167 --> 59:06.127
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

59:06.208 --> 59:07.788
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

59:07.875 --> 59:10.075
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

59:10.167 --> 59:12.707
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

59:17.375 --> 59:21.995
The woman always gets
to the bedroom first, completely naked.

59:22.083 --> 59:25.503
Completely naked.
"Come on, baby. Come on.

59:25.583 --> 59:27.083
Oh, I'm gonna fuck the shit... ".

59:27.167 --> 59:28.577
This foot completely dirty.

59:29.833 --> 59:33.633
This one clean, completely clean.
This one... gravel in the heel.

59:34.792 --> 59:37.212
"Come on, baby.
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.

59:37.292 --> 59:38.332
Come on."

59:40.500 --> 59:43.750
The man's walking down the hallway,
fully clothed.

59:46.833 --> 59:47.833
Drunk.

59:49.958 --> 59:51.418
Taking his time.

59:53.292 --> 59:56.462
He's kind of mad, too,
because not only is he drunk,

59:56.542 --> 59:58.582
but his dick is more drunk.

59:59.750 --> 01:00:01.500
And he doesn't know what to do,

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:04.423
because it's about to happen,
but he can't.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:09.460
And drunk guys will talk to their dicks.
They don't give a shit.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:10.832
Like, "Come on, wake up."

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.880
Come on. Why are you doing this to me?
Let's go. Why are you doing... ".

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.958
And your dick is, like,
"I'm drunk, too, asshole.

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:23.003
What the fuck do you want me to do?"

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:27.248
We'll start grabbing blood from anywhere.
"Don't do this to me."

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:33.292
"You need to give me something.
Don't do this to me."

01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:39.328
But our dick's our best friend.
He doesn't leave us hanging.

01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:41.707
He gives us something.
It's not much, but it's something.

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:46.292
It's like half-and-half.
Soft on top, hard in the middle.

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:50.633
And it's barely holding up. It's just
balancing on the balls like this.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.210
"Try this. This might work.
This might work."

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.226
And we're, like,
"Are you sure you're gonna work?"

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.960
"Hurry up before I change
my fucking mind."

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:03.212
And we go to put him in. He's, like,
"Man, I can't fucking do this."

01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.832
I love you guys. Thank you so much.
