Although I met him with different body

19:09.740 --> 19:10.880
My feelings remain the same

19:10.910 --> 19:12.380
This is my business card

19:12.380 --> 19:13.510
Call anytime when needed

19:13.510 --> 19:14.320
Yet

19:14.620 --> 19:17.820
I just do not see him more as a customer

19:24.030 --> 19:27.130
It feels anxious confessed to him

19:29.830 --> 19:31.230
totally ridiculous

19:33.670 --> 19:37.570
He said if the love a person, tomorrow could turn into a better figure

19:42.380 --> 19:43.040
But

19:43.610 --> 19:45.410
Thoughts and feelings are different things

19:45.980 --> 19:48.550
I want a handsome face

19:48.750 --> 19:52.790
so amazing to look younger than actual age

20:27.790 --> 20:30.390
I want to do with this face is, like someone

20:33.860 --> 20:36.060

20:55.520 --> 20:56.680
Could you help me

21:02.160 --> 21:04.360
Does this qualify to participate in the exhibition?

21:05.090 --> 21:07.800

21:22.180 --> 21:26.050

21:28.480 --> 21:30.420
Prefer steak or sushi

21:31.850 --> 21:32.250

46:03.690 --> 46:05.190
Yi Soo teaches how to be a healthy person

46:07.630 --> 46:11.960
wood used to make the chair

46:13.170 --> 46:14.700
I particularly liked the idea

46:15.840 --> 46:16.940
Enough for today

46:23.480 --> 46:25.440
My feelings are the same

46:25.950 --> 46:29.280
Worried because of lack of sleep

46:30.350 --> 46:32.250
It may even be worried anymore

46:33.490 --> 46:34.850
Now I realize it

46:38.020 --> 46:39.430
Enough for today

46:48.730 --> 46:52.410
They all are

46:56.280 --> 46:57.080
I

47:00.550 --> 47:05.520
After waking up my body changed

47:06.550 --> 47:10.590
So even though I changed to anyone that,

47:11.960 --> 47:13.430
I still was wo jin Kim

47:17.560 --> 47:19.900
It really does not make sense

47:20.330 --> 47:22.300
At that time we ate sushi and chat

47:23.840 --> 47:27.310
Sing along in the workshop

47:30.880 --> 47:31.910
Go to an antique store

47:33.580 --> 47:34.250
Ramirez

47:36.280 --> 47:40.820
Perhaps what I'm saying now is a bit crazy,

47:41.190 --> 47:46.130
I

47:45.000 --> 47:46.830
Likes

48:06.380 --> 48:08.580
I do not understand what you're talking about

48:14.920 --> 48:16.090
I tell you this

48:16.090 --> 48:18.860
is the truth

48:21.530 --> 48:23.100
Why is this happening to me?

48:29.400 --> 48:31.670
I shall sends a SMS

48:33.810 --> 48:36.480
from now on we should not meet again

48:58.200 --> 49:00.230
What do I tell him

49:01.770 --> 49:03.100
I promised accordance with

49:04.800 --> 49:06.540
At that time, when I woke up, my face changes shape

49:07.570 --> 49:09.140
I do not recognize my own face

49:11.410 --> 49:15.580
Even more painful, even my mother could not recognize me alone

49:16.480 --> 49:18.550
Sang Baek live better

49:23.760 --> 49:27.090
I became a man

49:40.970 --> 49:43.580
Come quickly road

49:43.580 --> 49:45.580
What are you doing ?

49:46.150 --> 49:50.980
Kak, if perhaps a person's face can be changed after sleep?

49:51.980 --> 49:55.820
Yes, that's what an artist

49:55.890 --> 49:59.860
When they were filming in the TV drama series, his face can change drastically

49:59.860 --> 50:03.100
Can make the shape of the face to be great, or shape of body fat

50:04.200 --> 50:06.670
You and the man these days do not contact each other, is there a problem?

50:09.240 --> 50:10.970
I'm not sure of what was happening

50:12.040 --> 50:14.510
Why? Inevitable something huh?

50:15.070 --> 50:16.480
I already know from the first

50:16.510 --> 50:17.680
The relationship must have ended quickly

50:17.680 --> 50:18.980
no

50:20.610 --> 50:21.910
actually

50:26.520 --> 50:30.220
I also do not understand, this is very complicated

50:36.130 --> 50:36.900
Ahh

50:55.550 --> 50:58.120
It should not have to wait for me, you can just eat it

50:58.150 --> 50:59.550
Because we are all friends so it should be shared, let's eat

51:00.090 --> 51:02.220
This sandwich looks good

51:02.550 --> 51:03.390
tasty at the

51:03.520 --> 51:05.890
I'd love to have a table like this

51:06.530 --> 51:09.560
Wow this music is so calming the mind

51:15.430 --> 51:16.100
Excuse me

51:19.340 --> 51:21.410
I want to buy a seat

51:21.610 --> 51:23.610
Type the size of the table by the chair

51:23.840 --> 51:25.880
The material of the tree cery and red colored chair

51:27.410 --> 51:29.850
I often sketched in Ecuador

51:29.980 --> 51:32.050
I hope his desk could be bigger

51:32.820 --> 51:34.850
Width may need to be adjusted

51:34.890 --> 51:35.650
Woo jin shi?

51:36.420 --> 51:36.860
Eh ?

51:39.630 --> 51:44.030
Sorry, I was wrong guy

52:33.850 --> 52:37.950
Aku mencari Kim Wo Jin

52:50.430 --> 52:51.890
Drinking tea?

52:55.510 --> 52:57.230
What is wrong ?

53:04.210 --> 53:05.110
Understand the Korean language support?

53:06.630 --> 53:08.100
I can not

53:16.790 --> 53:17.860
Really

53:20.430 --> 53:21.660
You jin Woo it?

53:24.020 --> 53:25.320
Yes, right

53:29.870 --> 53:33.210
So you liked it?

53:37.340 --> 53:38.340
Oh tidak

53:43.870 --> 53:45.660
Love

53:52.420 --> 53:54.690
If so let's sleep together

53:59.470 --> 54:00.700
I want to see

54:03.170 --> 54:05.740
Woo-jin change after waking from sleep

54:22.220 --> 54:23.960
Since when,

54:26.530 --> 54:27.760
be like this?

54:53.790 --> 54:54.920
How old are you?

54:56.960 --> 55:00.560
I mean, just curious

55:05.880 --> 55:08.020
head three

55:14.510 --> 55:16.640
Means we age only

55:17.780 --> 55:19.280
It should be said that the time was not formal

55:22.410 --> 55:24.320
Can not you die?

55:27.100 --> 55:28.970
I can not die now

55:30.120 --> 55:31.640
I do not know

55:40.670 --> 55:42.770
You do not understand it?

55:43.460 --> 55:44.840
Sorry

55:45.740 --> 55:47.710
True - it feels awkward yes

55:50.340 --> 55:51.680
Feel uncomfortable ?

55:57.210 --> 56:01.030
I love being able to have a girlfriend

56:07.360 --> 56:08.090
Why

56:11.060 --> 56:12.030
should I?

56:19.010 --> 56:20.930
Everyday

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.290
Woo jin shi

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.540
Today I see it

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:19.110
Next week we can meet again, after waking from sleep

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.850
For most people assume this is unusual

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.650
For me is a miracle

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.960
Each day I shared with Yi Soo

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.160
Doing little things

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.090
Everyday life becomes very valuable

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.530
Because there is Yi Soo

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.270
I continue to want to survive

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.130
and do various other things

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:50.140
Does it hurt woo jin shi?

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.950
How ?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.620
not bad

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.360
I do not know what to write what in the end

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.960
Yi Soo Korean letters should not be too big

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.330
Every day is very short

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.530
Every day I hope that this time never ends

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:17.600
I no longer need to only show one face

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.140
Everything is immortalized in a photograph

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.940
Halo

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.380
Gosh, today became an uncle yes

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:37.820
Bagimana people can stay in a place like this

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.660
my goodness

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.930
What is wrong ?

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.470
No, just wanted a closer look as to what the real face jin kim wo

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.340
Now it close?

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.580
yet, every day is still very strange to see you

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.640
Every day you show your face changes, weird right

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.950
Forgive me

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.120
but

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:04.520
hmm

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.320
Somehow I became very happy

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.990
Nona Yi Soo

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.630
I told you do not need to be formal

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.970
Someway

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.440
Thank you for changing my appearance

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:37.280
Yi Soo only person I really loved in this world

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.850
You can also taste this wine

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.590
You can not talk like that at adults

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.460
Do not say a disrespectful

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.330
why can not you?

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.930
Say it with reverence

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.230
do not want

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.000
toast

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.040
Keep briefly

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.580
toast

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:24.830
truly

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.100
age was not fooled ya

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.670
Drunk so quickly today

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.940
Kim Woo Jin

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.750
In total how much?

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.110
Which was booked before the total is ...

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.150
Use a credit card only

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.860
How to ?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.260
What is this?

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.190
Very weird

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.660
Your son will ya?

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.440
Oh my child

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.370
Togetherness at a time like this

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640
very warm

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.010
Very Happy

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.810
now I was

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.150
a man

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.090
What is wrong ?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.660
no, it's just

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.870
You are always changing

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.540
I do not need to see to feel yourself

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.270
The situation when it comes?

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.520
when grasping

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.690
I will recognize you

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.750
Dangdang

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.850
Certainly not eaten

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.020
no

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.620
already kok

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.260
coffee

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.760
Wow you drink coffee every day yes

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.240
right - the right wine, like my mother's cooking

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.770
The cuisine papa

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.780
It is

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.650
fall to

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.680
it contains a sense of love and sincerity

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:04.520
you who make this all right? / Right, please enjoy the cuisine

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.290
why always speak the language of formal?

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.000
Today a bit awkward huh?

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.610
no, just a little ..

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.040
Today you have to come

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.650
tables were empty, this is not good

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:32.620
It's been over a month Alice did not attend classes

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.620
Do not mind the work of others

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.020
Excessive once

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.030
I used to work

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:46.060
Today I had to wash clothes

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.570
cleaning house

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.930
and pay attention to the company as well

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.300
want to go along?

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:53.200
real?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.440
I was right - the right not to go to the club tonight

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.280
I was right - the right to have a serious problem

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.190
Do not get too serious

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.090
Want a cup of coffee

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:10.690
want coffee ?

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.660
Ah ok

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.430
I've often heard

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.630
has long hair and white face

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.970
This design uses a few concepts in the ocean

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:25.340
suitable for older people

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.410
and I heard a little bit about sound issues that arise at the table

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.440
has an interesting combination

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.340
not very nice

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:33.410
How ?

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:41.890
Will be better able to create new designs based on existing brand

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:46.860
where someone will be more like the product ALX

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.090
This will give you the opportunity to be able to move forward

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.500
and new standards

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:56.470
bright idea

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.470
Who are you?

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.640
Yi Soo intelligence

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:10.820
I will raise the price for loyalty like this, it will be something big

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.790
Try sitting

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.220
How ?

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:21.859
Very comfortable

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.790
Oh iya

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:27.830
I heard the company invited to the event, expressing gratitude

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.729
but

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:32.170
at a time like this, we have a lot of work to boost the reputation of the company ALX

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:33.569
I do not believe this

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.310
The important thing is I did not swim in water

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.680
Come with me to drink wine to remove the stuffiness

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.050
When ?

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.479
very beautiful furniture yes

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:47.950
Really pretty

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.170
Ask

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:11.910
really - did not match expectations

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.420
anything goes, yes?

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.319
Well, it is only natural to invite her grandmother's right yi soo

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.850
haih unnatural buildup

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.729
Do not be like this

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:32.760
please please

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.000
At least be a man

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:41.430
why alone?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.979
Drink wine although a little

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:47.640
they actually do not want?

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:53.450
This day should you come along with your girlfriend

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.650
Why ?

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.360
Every time I see you brought a different man

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.960
Curious who will last the longest

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:05.100
But if you really have a boyfriend?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.800
Exist

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:09.400
I will surprise you

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:14.270
Oh well, you always have a problem with men

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.010
Search only couple in this place

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.380
Who is the best?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.060
It's been a long wait?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.230
to

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.000
Halo

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:49.530
Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:52.950
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:54.880
Wow, ow

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.720
Glad to see you

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.520
I was senior Yi Soo

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.990
If so I go first

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:05.660
Have a good time

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:15.830
I'm really not kidding, two hours ago I became a grandmother

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.680
This man has a charm and very bright eyes

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.550
truly

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.780
I think this place is perfect for a drink

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.350
Hell, disgusting once

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.130
very good

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.370
why are you guys looking at each other

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.110
crazy policy

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.670
This man really is amazing is not it?

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:57.910
is very unique

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.580
Every waking have different looks

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.350
Sometimes a person Congkojen, sometimes also become a woman

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.450
The most stable was when he was a beautiful girl

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.790
Make me uncomfortable

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:10.420
Embarrassing

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:11.760
Believe it says this oppamu

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.660
Face to face, I really want to live with you

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:17.090
What you say

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:18.560
What kind of person are you?

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.900
Like him

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:22.900
Let's talk again

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.970
It seems Sang Baek drunken yes

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:27.710
I really - really do not get drunk

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.140
I say only because I was drunk

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.180
I hated Yi soo

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.980
Hah

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.120
Do not worry many lies when someone is drunk

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.650
Oh yes you buy a massage chair, right?

01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.060
You must have planned something dirty in that chair

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.530
you wait for Yi Soo sitting in the chair and do something like

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.130
Gila!

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.660
Yi Soo, Yi Soo

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.870
Kim Woo Jin is really a good person, do not hurt him

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:06.480
Yi Soo, you're also a good person but a little bit scary

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.450
Sorry I'm a little drunk

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.120
Sorry I'm a little late

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.920
I'm going to the toilet first, my bladder would burst

01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:17.520
If you get bored look-see sights around

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:19.960
let's get out

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.560
Let them play

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.860
I want to get married and raise a child

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:32.440
I had to earn money to raise your children

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.500
Fuck

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.170
look over there

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:16.640
Enough for today

01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:21.110
Enough for today

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.480
Enough for today

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.250
What is this ?

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.400
Why touch other people's cell phone?

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.270
you freak

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:43.670
I do not mean

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:44.540
What ?

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.540
Why do you store a lot of photos with others?

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:05.360
This is my mother's shop

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:07.560
It was my mother

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:13.960
I've been here

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.570
Not mounted such that

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.200
From here enter there

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.670
Regardless again

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.010
Try again

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:31.320
Wrapped twice a newly installed like this

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.090
I mean done quickly

01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:40.620
Next time I will teach you

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.290
Ok

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:44.800
Welcome

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.500
I heard Aunt is mamanya Woojin yes

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.610
I still do not understand him

01:16:56.610 --> 01:17:03.710
he is not Woojin of our family

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.090
It must be difficult for you

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.090
I can not be too much help

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.060
can only hope that you two fine

01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:23.830
Cheers

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:25.640
Yesterday I saw a strange man was standing beside the car

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.670
Then there is another man who is handsome and tall

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.480
It was the first time I saw

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.580
in the studio they do the same job

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.410
So you also see it right? Is not it ?

01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:35.950
Time shift night huh?

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.150
I also feel the same way

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.880
Already since when?

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.590
ALX when he was with the President at the workshop

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:44.320
Oh iya, benar

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.820
At the time I saw it with someone?

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.030
Oh iya itu Yi Soo

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.690
her with you

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.900
out, I'm on the side bar

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.500
Yi Soo, Yi Soo kamu mau kemana?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.470
Next time, next time

01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.340
What you do not want to hang out with us?

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.520
Where ?

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:18.190
now I was out

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:19.660
I also exist outside

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.230
dimananya?

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:23.090
see here

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.860
A closer look

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.440
Jangan main-main, dimana ?

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:09.370
I'm sorry, was just kidding

01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:27.930
Every day I try to convince him

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:33.230
Why did not I think of the feelings of Yi Soo

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:45.880
Yi Soo excuse me, I've made a mistake

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:48.250
I do not think you'll be so surprised

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.070
Do not laugh, my feelings were not tasty

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.570
What is wrong ?

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:18.810
Tomorrow the time comes, I want to see for the first time was Kim Woo Jin

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.050
So I did my best to avoid small problems

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680
You want to sleep here?

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.720
Nda tau ah

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.020
OK

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.370
Sorry to startle

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.510
Do not ever do that again

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.890
Halo

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.830
I just wanted to know how things

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.100
I was at home with very good

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.400
why do you sound?

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:53.140
This is because yesterday

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.610
Very sleepy

01:21:57.910 --> 01:22:00.880
Ohh so kah

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:07.320
Halo

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.530
Papa, let's see how his grotesque

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.640
Why are you lying like this now?

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.870
Now why are you still here?

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:38.220
Recently, there are crazy people in this district

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.490
I thought you were doing this madness, insane base

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:44.250
Sorry yesterday rather late

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.430
Even so try calling your mother at all times

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:50.390
Your mother keeps calling me every day, driving me crazy

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.700
if so, why did not you call me directly?

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.500
I do not call you or you are not lifted?

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.370
Forgive me

01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:04.640
Put it in the fridge properly

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.480
Be sure to include in the fridge dry, she said that to me a million times

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.680
Oww dizzy

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:13.280
Yi Soo and I took care of it

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.520
If so why do not you stay with it, do it right together

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.390
You think about it, right?

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:24.530
What your mother is wrong to eat the drug to their children to be like this?

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:30.030
Well, in the end true love can be obtained depending on how you do it until the end

01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:36.110
Married, I want to get married

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.980
Well, this time I will not hesitate anymore

01:24:10.710 --> 01:24:13.740
Preparation is completed

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:19.350
It seems like the timing is not right for today, better tomorrow

01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:25.160
This chair is made with a special wood material, using the most advanced technology, looks very natural

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.590
from the tree what?

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.660
oh

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.600
What size ?

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:39.900
Senior

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.780
Good afternoon, this chair has a good material

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:57.920
Is it drugs?

01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.590
not

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:04.860
Yi Soo please come to my office for a while

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:07.600
Ok

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.870
Yi Soo, if you're sick?

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:19.410
Pencernaanku slightly disturbed only

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.050
Lately, my irregular

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.980
Why can not sleep?

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.790
Certainly because of the man right?

01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:36.690
di bar itu

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:43.870
There are rumors that you often bring different men

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.070
The President also told me

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.040
Although it is somewhat unreasonable

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.440
But the rumor was heard by word of mouth

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.780
I worry about it, usually you always look very healthy

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.610
Lately, you do not look healthy and consume drugs,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.020
tell me

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.620
I really do not hurt

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.620
If anything happens I'll tell you

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.900
can chat comfortably

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.500
Either begins where

01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:30.180
I love people who are very strange

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.690
became a very different person when waking from sleep

01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:41.830
Very weird right?

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:47.430
You say I can record it right?

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.630
Lately, I'm a bit forgetful

01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:50.930
do

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:06.120
Togetherness beautiful

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:09.190
no need to think about anything else

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:14.160
Although there are some things difficult

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.300
Stay like this

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
You keep being you are now

01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:25.000
I keep being me now

01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.840
Yi Soo

01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.970
heh ?

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:34.680
What if we got married?

01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:54.900
Drinking wine is made to what I say so reckless

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:10.810
I've said

01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:12.620
Are you angry?

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.480
No

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.590
I think too much about myself

01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:23.630
could stop the car

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:45.350
Something like a marriage should be thought out very mature

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.250
Do not you think so?

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.820
How do we introduce themselves to their families - each?

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.730
It also needs to be well thought out

01:28:59.100 --> 01:28:59.800
Yi Soo

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:02.900
I

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.340
When every morning you and I were always together

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.210
I've been thinking about it since then

01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:17.780
I wish we could live together

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.220
Duh this ye ...

01:29:24.190 --> 01:29:25.960
Always think of yourself huh?

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:32.400
You know, it's not something that can be decided by an instant

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:36.970
Every morning I have to see the changes yourself, and will continue to change

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:40.670
I also want to

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.610
It does not matter to me, but in the end

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:47.740
It made me have to think and consider more deeply

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.220
You should also consider such

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.390
What will I tell my friends when they ask about her husband who was with always changing?

01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.990
How well how to explain it to my family?

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:04.590
How can I introduce you to someone else?

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.530
Really what was said Yi Soo

01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:12.500
So I got mad at myself

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:16.640
Make a wedding is an easy thing to do, but how to solve problems afterwards?

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.450
You do not even think about it and immediately decided to get married

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.480
How can I calm with direct marry you?

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:33.520
Know, I'm really in a very difficult situation

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:40.830
Can you give some time?

01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.510
It's okay, do not sweat anymore

01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:56.580
Please look at me

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.220
I think we both have the same thoughts

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:08.190
I understand, it is not easy to love the heart of one man with a face that changes every moment

01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:15.700
You can recognize every person you meet?

01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:19.000
He was always the first one is always with me

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:27.210
I can instantly recognize, just by holding his hands alone

01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:30.850
But docks,

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:39.060
I can not immediately recognize the person I love when someone grabbed my hand

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.330
He smiled at me,

01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:49.070
so I just responded with a smile

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:58.910
At that time, I really can not recognize it properly

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.010
Such disorders can occur due to heavy stress

01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:10.890
Whether the person who touched it was people I love, whether the truth is she?

01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:12.860
I continue to think that way

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.790
But I still do not know

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:23.900
When closed his eyes and hugged him, my heart really feel comfortable

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.910
Gradually, it seems to me like being a very strange person Doc

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.840
You want to end it?

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.780
I may not be able to continue work without his presence dock

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.960
If so let us say the truth, rather than make you suffer

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.690
If you do not say, only one person will survive

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.670
a person's heart can not be fooled, the pain could be over any

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.640
Dizzy

01:33:23.690 --> 01:33:26.960
This patient had no apparent consciousness, he seems to consume too much of the drug

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.030
Moment

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.100
Since when patients taking the drug?

01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:41.910
Yes, yes I understand

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.480
Keluarga Yi Soo

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:48.690
Psychiatric doctor will come soon, please sit down

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.360
What kind of drugs?

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:56.360
inside the bag was found risperidone patients (Note: risperidone is an antipsychotic drug that is derived from the prescription, used to treat psychiatric disorders)

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.130
Looks like you're not aware of it at all?

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:07.100
This drug is only temporary, should not be consumed frequently

01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:12.580
also can not be used as a solution

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.710
because it will only continue become more dangerous diseases

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:23.790
You should tell this to your lover ya soon, can not you?

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.630
I do not know what to say

01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:33.900
He keeps alone pain so deep

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.810
In situations like that, I'd say something that might just be a dream

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.880
Yi Soo should have said from the beginning

01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:02.160
He should never see me

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.200
But

01:35:12.570 --> 01:35:13.640
Is there something?

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:20.910
Could be together with you as this is very convenient

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:25.980
I can not often meet with my son

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:37.290
Have you eaten ?

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.230
to

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:49.170
You are exactly the same with him, no doubt

01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:51.640
What does that mean?

01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:55.750
My son looks very good

01:35:57.250 --> 01:36:02.120
slowly he turned into someone better

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:04.890
What is the meaning of your words?

01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:14.130
Kamu sama seperti papamu

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.740
Papa too often turns into another person

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:28.080
To protect you, papa conceal his identity to others

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.580
Sometimes his voice turning into a woman and man

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.420
He hides the changes that you very well

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.020
One day while going to the flower garden

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:44.930
I do not see him again, she vanished

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.200
The next day

01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:55.070
I already do not remember his face again

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:58.470
I keep thinking of your father

01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.450
Where he is and is doing what?

01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:09.890
but your father can not be found, he has disappeared

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:14.920
since then, my life became too difficult

01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:17.560
Very scary

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:33.240
One day, your father just left the money and a letter, your father really disappeared thereafter

01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:39.950
That's not your father's desire disappear

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.180
it's because I

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.520
Papa wanted to disappear because mama determined not to leave

01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:51.530
Living together is very heavy

01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:55.670
He failed to convince others about him

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.500
I was terrified

01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:01.070
Why did not you tell me earlier?

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.740
papa is also the same with me, like a monster

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.520
Papa went like that, what can not I go too?

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.700
could survive until now, Mama has been through a very difficult life

01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:32.270
But

01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:36.640
What should I do to Yi Soo?

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:47.850
S#u-b-t-i#t-l,e b~y . S#e#F#n/i/A/Z\```
'Pl.3 as.e r.4't ee.
tH4n]k .~. yOU*

01:39:03.230 --> 01:39:07.440
Yi Soo will suffer if I defend her love

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:17.850
It was good to see the face Yi Soo every day

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:23.420
Yi Soo did not care about my appearance difference

01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:29.160
I believe the two people who love each other can live together

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.500
Love can overcome various problems

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:48.240
But love can also be disastrous

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.560
Time to go home

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.530
See you tomorrow

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:06.400
Go home first

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.330
Good night

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:25.850
I was going to eat with my friend

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.880
I have something for you

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.950
What is it?

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.600
Whether this was the seat of the couple?

01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:49.440
This chair that I made especially for you, I've wanted to give

01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:52.780
Try sitting

01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:04.620
You like it?

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.120
Very

01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:14.630
The snow is very beautiful

01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:18.570
Have not seen this beautiful snow

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.770
Strange yes, why snow is not cold?

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.740
What we are going for a walk?

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:42.320
Yi Soo

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:43.630
of?

01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:48.700
What do ya good for tomorrow?

01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:56.940
we just end this relationship

01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:07.250
What is wrong ?

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.020
Do something good

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.800
Never consume drugs again

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:36.080
Fast return, you can chill

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:41.580
Woo jin

01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:38.340
Previously, he was always there by my side

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.710
But now it does not exist

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:53.790
I do not know what to do

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.830
Please help reinforce this heart

01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:08.870
What is this ?

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:23.250
It certainly woo jin who make right?

01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:27.460
Wah

01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:33.600
It is very fitting with your body size

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.590
Kak

01:45:05.530 --> 01:45:08.500
I remember

01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:13.000
when we all eat in the restaurant

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.900
I remember everything

01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.940
But I do not remember the faces of people I love

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.450
What should I do ?

01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:56.310
All the lies that occurred in the past slowly resolved

01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:01.720
Can sleep well without drugs

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.320
Continuing life

01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:11.990
Sometimes read books and newspapers

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.970
sometimes also talking to myself

01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:23.110
What I did yesterday and tomorrow?

01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:28.310
Every day has the same face

01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:31.950
Every day in the mood of uncertainty

01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:40.690
Perhaps it is not you the person who changed every day

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.160
but I changed

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:51.200
we have a living room and the bed is the best

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:59.040
Couch is also good

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.010
You can consider it slowly, and call me if you feel fit

01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.480
good

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:15.290
Yi Soo, have blogs and various photographs of various kinds of furniture, what do you think?

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.790
This is great

01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:19.090
it's good, is not it

01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:23.870
Source still unknown

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:26.240
Why do you think he spread to the internet in this way?

01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:32.170
I wonder who the designer who publishes products, we should examine

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:37.810
Oh yes, you will work closely with the company ALX right?

01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:42.150
I'll talk to you

01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:42.890
Ok

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.590
sorry there had been an emergency telephone

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.860
We start from where?

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:54.100
I'm here to work Sang Baek Shi

01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:57.870
So you do not need to be awkward

01:47:58.730 --> 01:48:01.240
Welcome to work together next week

01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:07.310
Thank you, we will be prepared by slowly

01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:12.050
You can call anytime if needed

01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:14.420
This can not be done alone

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.470
Woo Jin where? what she okay?

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:39.110
Czech

01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.080
He went far away

01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:45.350
I go home

01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:46.520
Oh ya

01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.490
Pa

01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:59.290
What is wrong ?

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:02.820
Do not miss Mama papa?

01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:04.700
What did you say?

01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:07.340
Why papa do not want a story about Mama?

01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:09.810
I also miss

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:17.680
If mama is still there

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.750
What most want papa to do with him?

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:27.690
I do not know, can live together enjoy the old days

01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:35.460
Want to be older before your mama

01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:58.290
Halo senior

01:49:58.290 --> 01:50:00.660
Hello, you come earlier?

01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:29.280
I do not know what to live life like?

01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:38.190
abandoned by loved ones

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.000
I want to go through all the pain and confusion of this with you

01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:51.910
Maybe I deserve this pain, do not know what to like what else

01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:53.980
Senior

01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:01.720
Very nice song

01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:43.720
Halo, ini woo jin ?

01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:47.960
What is wrong ? I'm very busy now

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.860
What you say ? I do not understand

01:52:58.570 --> 01:53:00.800
I hung up the phone ya?

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.010
Bah language what it is? Are you drunk?

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:07.580
Eat or drink something good, next time call me when you wake into the Korean, understand?

01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:11.910
I closed yes

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:56.350
I'm here to meet Kim Woo Jin

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.470
I doubt you've mistaken

01:54:00.090 --> 01:54:02.170
In this place there is no such a name

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.960
I think he lives here

01:54:07.150 --> 01:54:08.630
Are you sure ?

01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:10.500
Yes, I'm sure

01:54:11.370 --> 01:54:12.710
Sorry

01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:13.830
Wait

01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:23.740
This is the office furniture LEA right?

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:30.530
If no objection, may I go in and see the furniture yours

01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:34.750
The same day I fired my boss in Korea

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:37.710
A large furniture company

01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:32.550
You want some tea?

01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:50.420
Working alone?

01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:52.410
The

01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:01.850
Our company is very interested in your work

01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:07.300
I came here by crossing Korea and

01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:11.750
I was dying

01:56:15.670 --> 01:56:17.850
I can just imagine you

01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:22.370
But I wanted to see and talk to

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.920
and I believe I did it

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.990
Woo Jin

01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:51.630
Now I'm fine

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.180
You still sore

01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:25.800
but the more you suffer from pain that I experienced

01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:34.940
Forgive me Woo Jin

01:58:28.530 --> 01:58:32.670
Promise me not to do it again, right?

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.510
Yi Soo

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:43.580
I've thought about it, will live with you

01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:48.020
Something like a quandary when faced with someone

01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:51.090
live life like people in general

01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:58.230
I see you've changed

01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:06.170
compared to when you first met, you have shown that change

01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:15.380
To be honest I was a little scared

01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:29.790
but over time, the fear it will turn into gratitude

01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:35.460
Because each day passed along Woo Jin

01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:45.040
I wonder what kind of person you become in the future, it is not a problem for me

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:54.150
Because I love you all contained inside Kim Woo Jin

01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:00.390
Sorry to delay too long

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:10.570
Woojin ... will you marry me?

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:19.310
I do not know, I'm afraid you're going to dump me after seeing turned into frightening creatures

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:26.750
You do not consider it properly?

02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:31.650
Do you not want to do it fast? Ga would ya?

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:12.760
We will carry out many marriages

02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:18.130
Started walking from that direction, hurry

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.060

Thank You For Watching

02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:07.500
Sorry For Incorrect translated words

02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:13.090
Please Rate

02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:22.060
......

02:04:28.290 --> 02:04:32.330
The beginning of fear and anger

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:40.170
What should I do when our children ask about you?

02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:46.010
I think it is too difficult to bear this burden

02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:53.350
That's why I can not appear in front of you

02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:57.350
I will protect you from a distance

02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.750
Because only you know

02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:05.230
I know

02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:11.330
I can feel your pain

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:17.470
Now do not suffer anymore

02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:20.340
Now I worry about other things

02:05:22.210 --> 02:05:24.650
I'm afraid you'll go far

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.320
What shall I do without you?

02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:36.290
More frightening again when we can not coexist with each other

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:41.000
of the love,

02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:52.840
I prefer to be always with you

02:05:53.305 --> 02:05:59.682
