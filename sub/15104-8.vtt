00:00.501 --> 00:02.234

00:03.671 --> 00:05.404
On "ice road truckers"...

00:05.406 --> 00:07.506
Art: Let's roll, baby.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.141

00:09.143 --> 00:12.011
alex: This road is rotting away
underneath us.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.946

00:15.349 --> 00:16.749
alex: Whoa!

00:16.751 --> 00:19.051
Narrator: As the spring thaw
torpedoes the north...

00:19.053 --> 00:21.487
Lisa: It's a race against time
right now.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.055
Narrator: And looks to claim...

00:23.057 --> 00:24.490
(loud thud)
lisa: Ah!

00:24.492 --> 00:26.658
Narrator: As many victims
as it can.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.994

lisa: Ah-ah!

00:31.766 --> 00:46.412
♪ ♪

00:46.414 --> 00:59.558
♪ ♪

01:06.333 --> 01:08.100
(wind whips)

01:09.470 --> 01:11.837
narrator: On the remote trail
to big trout lake,

01:11.839 --> 01:13.238
(crow caws)

01:14.642 --> 01:16.408
50 miles from the nearest
town...

01:18.612 --> 01:20.512
- Oh. (engine rattles)

01:24.051 --> 01:25.951
narrator: A broken down truck
may signal

01:25.953 --> 01:28.320
an early end of the season
for todd dewey.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.222
(engine rattles)

01:30.224 --> 01:31.957
todd: The stopper is almost
hittin' the frame

01:31.959 --> 01:34.193
to keep it from movin'
and it ain't good,

01:34.195 --> 01:36.028
I'll tell you that right now.
It ain't good.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.396
(airbrakes hiss)

01:37.398 --> 01:39.832
narrator: Last night...

01:39.834 --> 01:42.134
After being closed all season
due to warm temperatures...

01:42.136 --> 01:44.903
(door shuts)

01:44.905 --> 01:47.473
narrator: The road to big trout
was opened for todd

01:47.475 --> 01:49.741
and his 20-ton load
of building supplies

01:49.743 --> 01:52.211
needed for a giant
construction project.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.013
Todd: Here we go.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.317
Narrator: But the rugged terrain
took a toll on todd's rig.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.019
(high pitched whine,
loud thumps)

02:08.329 --> 02:10.629
narrator: And left the truck
un-drivable.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.064
- This truck is done.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.465
It's not moving on its own
from right here

02:13.467 --> 02:15.300
for any way shape or form.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.204
(wind gusts)

02:21.609 --> 02:23.142
I know how important
these loads are

02:23.144 --> 02:24.910
for these communities.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.813
It's what they live on,
it's their life line.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.715
If these communities
don't get their loads

02:29.717 --> 02:31.683
because we were unable
as drivers

02:31.685 --> 02:33.986
to produce the products
to them,

02:33.988 --> 02:37.422
that's gonna put a huge
emotional tug on me.

02:37.424 --> 02:38.824
(crow caws)

02:40.227 --> 02:42.094
but what if your truck
breaks down,

02:42.096 --> 02:43.829
what do you do then?

02:43.831 --> 02:46.632
It's not just about sittin'
in a seat and shiftin' gears.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.500
You gotta know how to fix
your truck.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.671
Right now I just need
to get the load off.

02:52.673 --> 02:56.008
Narrator: With a crucial haul
for the community on the line

02:56.010 --> 02:58.310
todd's not goin' down
without a fight.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.648
- Maybe I can come up with a
little uh, macgyver rig,

03:02.650 --> 03:04.917
maybe strap down
the broken leaf spring

03:04.919 --> 03:06.518
and try to hold it in place.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.121
Narrator: Leaf springs support
the weight of the rig.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.456
Without them the body
of the truck

03:11.458 --> 03:13.425
would collapse onto the axels.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.096
Todd: I don't have great big
jacks and a leaf spring

03:18.098 --> 03:20.265
sittin' in the back end of
the truck there to change out.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.868
It's damn near impossible
to do up here.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.536
That's just the way it is.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.906
Narrator: With only a spare
tow strap to work with,

03:27.908 --> 03:30.909
the veteran will try
a hail mary.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.444
- Comin' out.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.048
So I put a real tight wrap on it

03:36.050 --> 03:38.884
to hold it to the broken spring
so the bottom spring cannot,

03:38.886 --> 03:41.320
you know, shift position
that it's in,

03:41.322 --> 03:44.022
and all I can do now is
just keep my fingers crossed

03:44.024 --> 03:45.490
and hope for the best.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.260
I'm gonna do everything
in my power.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.395
I'm gonna get my load there
one way or another.

03:50.397 --> 03:54.066
Narrator: With the jerry rig in
place it's the moment of truth.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.135
(airbrakes hiss)
- here we go.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.537
(engine rumbles)

04:00.774 --> 04:02.107
(tires crunch on snow)

04:02.109 --> 04:03.642
come on, girl.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.382
Yes! That's what I'm talkin'
about right there!

04:10.384 --> 04:12.284
Oh...

04:12.286 --> 04:14.386
Say a good prayer to the lord.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.589
Narrator: The quick fix holds
and todd's back on the road...

04:17.591 --> 04:19.458
For now.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.660
Todd: So I'm gonna really have
to just try to limp the truck,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.061
take my time.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.030
This is a major deal.
It's a leaf spring,

04:25.032 --> 04:30.035
connected to my steer axel so
that's a major, major break.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.436
(spring rattles)

04:33.407 --> 04:35.073
all it's gonna take
is one hard impact

04:35.075 --> 04:36.808
and there I'll sit
dead in the water

04:36.810 --> 04:38.910
and this truck ain't gonna move.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.847
Narrator: With hours of driving
still ahead,

04:41.849 --> 04:44.449
on a road that's falling
apart fast,

04:44.451 --> 04:46.418
(loud thump)
- hang on.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.788
Narrator: Pulling off the
mission is a long shot.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.191
- We'll just trying to push
in here, get the load off,

04:53.193 --> 04:54.993
and take us out of there.
There's nothing else I can do.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.395
I, I don't know what to do.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.796
This, this trip has almost
turned into

04:57.798 --> 04:59.164
a complete-(bleep) disaster.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.599
(truck rattles)

05:03.070 --> 05:05.103
narrator: But the top dog's
not the only driver

05:05.105 --> 05:06.738
who's up against it.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.610
Throughout the winter road
system,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.912
the early spring's hit...

05:13.914 --> 05:15.814
(loud thump)
and it's hit hard,

05:17.184 --> 05:20.252
and now it's the melt
versus the truckers.

05:21.588 --> 05:25.023
Everywhere trails are turnin'
to mud and slush.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.992
(splashing)

05:26.994 --> 05:28.560
ice crossings are dissolving

05:28.562 --> 05:31.096
in the rapidly warming
temperatures.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.599
So the race is on
to get the final loads in

05:34.601 --> 05:36.902
before the last open roads
are shut down...

05:39.206 --> 05:40.906
For good.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.511
And in ontario on the road
to sandy lake...

05:51.452 --> 05:52.851
(truck rumbles)

05:54.488 --> 05:57.522
lisa kelly's chargin' right
onto the battlefield.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.924
(loud thump)

06:00.794 --> 06:02.227
(loud thumps)

06:03.630 --> 06:06.365
- I can't wait to get off
this road because...

06:06.367 --> 06:08.934
I don't even think this road's
gonna last another day.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.938
Heck, I don't even think
the road's gonna finish
lasting today.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.339
(rumbling thumps)

06:15.709 --> 06:19.444
I've never seen it this,
this... Falling apart.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.846
(truck rumbles)

06:23.517 --> 06:27.519
narrator: On lisa's last trip
to deliver a top dollar haul...

06:27.521 --> 06:29.354
(loud bang)
lisa: Ah!

06:29.356 --> 06:31.289
Pretty much a nightmare road.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.925
Narrator: She tangled with
the same brutal trail...

06:33.927 --> 06:36.695
(loud bang)
lisa: Ah! Oh (bleep).

06:38.365 --> 06:39.765
Oh (bleep)!

06:39.767 --> 06:42.667
Narrator: And even fought
a fire along the way.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.169
Lisa: The truck's burning.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.304
(extinguisher whooshes)

06:46.306 --> 06:49.841
the, uh, tundra dried out and
caught on fire on the exhaust.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.844
Narrator: But now...

06:52.846 --> 06:55.280
- This road is fallin' apart.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.949
I'm hoping I can just make it.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.285
And I feel like it's just
crumbling behind me.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.686
(loud rattling)

07:01.688 --> 07:03.755
narrator: She's back on
the road to sandy lake

07:03.757 --> 07:06.792
and she's nabbed a last minute
haul with double the price tag.

07:08.562 --> 07:12.564
Lisa: I'm not sure how there
could be any road after this.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.400
Like it's no wonder I haven't
seen any other trucks.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.069
There's no way for them
to get in here.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.572
Narrator: With temperatures
soaring to record levels,

07:20.574 --> 07:24.276
she's the only driver willing
to tackle the dissolving path.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.111
(rattling thumps)

07:26.113 --> 07:27.512
but with the short season

07:27.514 --> 07:30.115
her company needs the cash
to stay afloat.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.453
Lisa: Wow, that's like mud.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.022
(tires churn)

07:37.024 --> 07:38.490
(water splashes)

07:39.827 --> 07:41.493
it's kind of like having
a rudder on this thing.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.895
I kind of point it in the
direction I'd like to go

07:43.897 --> 07:46.064
and maybe it'll go that way
I don't know.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.866

(bleep)!

08:00.047 --> 08:01.513

Come on, get in gear!

08:03.717 --> 08:05.650

08:05.652 --> 08:09.454
like I'm gonna try hard just
not to go in the ditch.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.057
Like I'm gonna be in the centre
of this really wide road

08:12.059 --> 08:13.992

That's all there is to it.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.238
narrator: Lisa kelly's path

10:40.240 --> 10:43.108
looks more like a swimming pool
than an ice crossing.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.244
- There's so many cracks
on this.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.813
I'm trying to drive not on
a crack and I can't do it.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.852
Narrator: The warm temperatures
took a toll on the road,

10:53.854 --> 10:56.021
but it's nothing compared
to the damage done

10:56.023 --> 10:57.489
to the crossing.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.225
And with each passing minute,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.527
the melting ice
is gettin' thinner...

11:02.529 --> 11:03.928

11:11.571 --> 11:12.971
And that's when they start
to get dangerous

11:12.973 --> 11:15.974
because if the cracks connect
in a circle

11:15.976 --> 11:18.376
then you've got free floater,

11:18.378 --> 11:19.744
that's not connected
to the rest of the ice so...

11:19.746 --> 11:22.614
If you drive on it
you can flip it

11:32.159 --> 11:33.692
and no cracking is a bad sign

11:33.694 --> 11:38.430
because it means you're
probably on one of those.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.266
Narrator: The water below
plummets

11:41.268 --> 11:43.535
to depths of over
a hundred feet.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.971
- And I can't see under
the slush and water either

11:46.973 --> 11:49.207
to see what's goin' on.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.111
Narrator: But on the surface
the water's already risin' up

11:53.113 --> 11:54.546
to her wheels.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.781
(water splashes)

11:56.783 --> 11:58.216
(ice cracking)

12:01.555 --> 12:03.021
(ice cracking)

12:06.560 --> 12:07.959
- I can see the end.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.895
I just hope I get to see
the end.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.201
Oh my gosh.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.003
(ice cracking)

12:20.741 --> 12:23.475
(ice cracking, truck rumbles)

12:23.477 --> 12:24.909
(water splashes)

12:28.815 --> 12:31.449
(water splashes, truck rattles)

12:36.757 --> 12:39.290
oh, it's just super slushy
right before the shore

12:39.292 --> 12:41.259
and I don't really like that

12:41.261 --> 12:44.162
because it makes it really hard
to get through,

12:44.164 --> 12:47.132
especially at such low speeds.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.301
Narrator: Now lisa must pass
over the edge of the crossing

12:50.303 --> 12:53.338
where the ice is at its
thinnest.

12:53.340 --> 12:59.043
- The last thing I need
is to get stuck on it.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.045
I'm just gonna try to get in
a tire track here

13:01.047 --> 13:04.315
and get off of this thing.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.019
(water splashes)

13:11.291 --> 13:13.758
(ice cracking)

13:13.760 --> 13:16.027
just a little bit more to go.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.229
(engine whines)

13:18.231 --> 13:19.664
whoa!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.099
(water splashes)

13:22.469 --> 13:25.203
I'm kind of spinnin' my tire.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.338
Not good.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.706
(loud rumbling)

13:28.708 --> 13:31.042
I, I can't get stuck here.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.014
(ice cracking, engine whirs)

13:36.016 --> 13:37.448
(truck whines)

13:40.287 --> 13:42.921
(water splashes,
truck rumbles)

13:45.625 --> 13:47.091
(engine sputters)

13:48.762 --> 13:50.195
(water splashes)

13:53.934 --> 13:55.800
oh my gosh, I made it!

13:57.704 --> 14:00.338
Narrator: Lisa may have
conquered the crossing...

14:00.340 --> 14:03.274
Lisa: It's a race against time
right now.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.410
Narrator: But with more
than 20 miles

14:05.412 --> 14:07.512
of pulverized road ahead...

14:07.514 --> 14:09.614
(loud rutting thumps)

14:09.616 --> 14:11.916
this job's still not over.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.057
A 100 miles in the south west,

14:19.059 --> 14:22.193
an ice road legend's ridin'
right into the thick of it too.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.463
Alex: Thank you, lord.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.198
Help us have a good day today.

14:29.336 --> 14:33.238
Help me get through this
next rough section of road.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.006
Amen.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.011
Narrator: Alex debogorski's
hauling 12-tons of building
materials.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.080
(truck groans)

14:42.082 --> 14:44.816
the last haul due into
saint theresa point,

14:44.818 --> 14:46.918
a rugged 400 mile trail

14:46.920 --> 14:50.154
that's been giving the driver's
trouble all season.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.525
- It's not very far to
saint theresa point,

14:54.527 --> 14:56.227
but I've got a number
of challenges yet.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.130
There's a whole bunch of hills.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.799
I got some holes
with water in 'em.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.335
It's slippery, temperatures
are warming up.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.473
This road might close soon,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.875
and there were rumors of rain.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.411
Rain'll definitely finish
this road off.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.446
(truck rumbles, rattles)

15:17.817 --> 15:19.918
a guy's got to be on the ball
to drive this section of road.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.254
Narrator: The melt's destroyed
the route.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.290
Alex: Here comes the bumps.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.658
Narrator: And it's putting
the old pro

15:26.660 --> 15:28.559
and his load to the test.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.295
(loud thumps)

15:32.265 --> 15:33.698
(truck groans)

15:36.236 --> 15:37.936
- she's growlin'.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.340
Narrator: Up ahead...

15:42.342 --> 15:44.409
- Ooh...

15:44.411 --> 15:45.810
(gear grinds)

15:45.812 --> 15:47.312
this here's trouble.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.717
Narrator: The path's gettin'
even tougher.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.118
Alex: I'm gonna have
a look here

15:54.120 --> 15:56.754
to see which way is the best
angle of attack.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.558
(airbrake hisses)

16:04.064 --> 16:06.698
it definitely doesn't look
very good that's for sure.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.736
(door shuts)

16:15.542 --> 16:18.309
(wind whips)

16:25.285 --> 16:28.920
narrator: A creek that had been
frozen is starting to thaw.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.793
- I could get stuck
going through here,

16:38.131 --> 16:39.497
but I really don't have
a lot of choices

16:39.499 --> 16:42.100
if I want to go to
saint theresa point.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.069
But I gotta hit it
at a certain speed

16:45.071 --> 16:48.439
where I can bounce through
the holes and...

16:49.876 --> 16:52.410
Don't let it grab me
so it doesn't stop me.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.115
Narrator: With no way around it
the question is:

16:57.117 --> 16:59.450
How deep does the water go?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.191
- I'll figure out how deep
these holes are.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.297
(cracking taps)
ooh, that's definitely uh...

17:15.168 --> 17:17.402
Maybe I don't want
to go over here.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.606
(cracking tap)
well, that's gettin' down there.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.674
(cracking tap)
ooh.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.109
(cracking taps)

17:27.981 --> 17:29.380
the creek's the deepest
on this side.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.782
If a guy breaks through

17:30.784 --> 17:32.450
he could end up with a truck
laying on its side.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.719
It could be really deep in here.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.554
So I'm just gonna stay
in the middle.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.992
We'll leave the stick
for the next guy.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.894
Narrator: With his strategy
in place,

17:44.264 --> 17:45.863
alex readies for battle.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.598
(door shuts)

17:51.771 --> 17:54.705
alex: I might rip the wheel off
the truck if I'm not careful.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.277
Father, son, holy spirit. Amen.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.245
(gear grinds)

18:01.247 --> 18:04.015
(truck rumbles, chains clank)

18:07.454 --> 18:08.920
(clanking thumps)

18:11.591 --> 18:13.458
(loud thump)

18:13.460 --> 18:15.593
(engine rumbles, loud thumps)

18:16.963 --> 18:18.496
(chains clink)

18:18.498 --> 18:21.099
(loud thumps)

18:21.101 --> 18:22.500
(engine whirs, big thump)
whoa!

18:28.241 --> 18:31.342
Narrator: On the road to
saint theresa point...

18:31.344 --> 18:33.744
(truck rumbles, chains clink)

18:35.215 --> 18:36.948
(loud thumps)

18:36.950 --> 18:39.851
alex debogorski could
be in deep water.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.855
(chains clink)

18:43.857 --> 18:46.124
(loud thumps, big bang)
whoa!

18:53.600 --> 18:55.099
(tires churn)

18:57.737 --> 18:59.403
- oh, I'm spinning,
spinning, spinning.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.405
Come on, come on, come on.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.274
Narrator: Alex made it through
the creek,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.376
but he may have cut the corner
too tight.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.945
(tires churn)

19:07.947 --> 19:09.380
(tires churn and spin)

19:09.382 --> 19:11.582
- okay, you want stuck,
we got stuck.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.818
(chains clatter, engine idles)

19:17.457 --> 19:20.658
caught the snow bank
with the left rear wheel.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.426
That's not cool at all.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.930
Narrator: The old pro's lodged
in the bank.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.401
I went in there
too friggin' tight

19:30.403 --> 19:33.271
and I put her in a friggin'
snow bank.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.273
Narrator: And the only way
to get out...

19:35.275 --> 19:37.308
(tires crunch)

19:37.310 --> 19:40.311
is to back up through
the melted mess.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.114
(chains clink)

19:44.484 --> 19:46.017
(engine rumbles)

19:48.621 --> 19:50.621
(chains clink, tires crunch)

19:53.793 --> 19:56.427
(tires rattle and rumble)

19:58.665 --> 20:00.097
- son of a b.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.833
Narrator: Now what's left
of the surface

20:02.835 --> 20:05.236
has been torn to pieces
by alex's tires.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.005
(chains clink)

20:08.007 --> 20:09.440
(loud thumps)

20:11.044 --> 20:13.511
narrator: But he's got to go
through it again.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.981
Alex: Hang on!

20:16.983 --> 20:18.449
(tires rumbles)

20:21.054 --> 20:22.520
(rattling thumps)

20:28.261 --> 20:29.794
(chains clink)

20:31.831 --> 20:33.231
(rattling thumps)

20:34.734 --> 20:37.301
(engine rumbles, chains clink)

20:40.106 --> 20:42.406
(engine revs, chains clink)

20:43.743 --> 20:45.209
almost.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.012
(truck rumbles)

20:49.349 --> 20:50.815
ah, we got her.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.818
Stressin' me out.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.121
When that creek is flowing

20:57.123 --> 21:00.157
it's actually flowing
through there.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.727
It must have been frozen
and now as it's thawing out

21:02.729 --> 21:04.195
it's just startin' to flow

21:04.197 --> 21:06.430
and of course as it's flowing
it's just...

21:07.767 --> 21:10.468
We were driving on ice there
and the ice is gone.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.638
Narrator: While alex wins
a round against the melt...

21:13.640 --> 21:15.606
- Thank you, lord.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.511
Narrator: 200 miles to the
north east...

21:22.015 --> 21:24.982
Right now I have the road
to fight, hang on and navigate,

21:24.984 --> 21:28.319
and it does not want
to cooperate very well.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.022
Narrator: Polar's top dog's
in a fight of his own.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.492
(metallic clattering)

21:34.494 --> 21:36.127
todd: And if that last spring
breaks

21:36.129 --> 21:39.196
I am absolutely screwed
100 percent.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.932
Narrator: With a single
tow strap

21:41.934 --> 21:43.567
holding his broken leaf spring
in place,

21:43.569 --> 21:45.670
todd dewey's strugglin'
to get through

21:45.672 --> 21:48.306
the last 20 miles
to big trout lake.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.374
(metallic squeaking)

21:50.376 --> 21:52.443
(loud thump)
- damn it!

21:52.445 --> 21:53.978
(metallic groan)

21:53.980 --> 21:55.346
that kind of hole right there

21:55.348 --> 21:56.747
will finish this truck
right off.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.483
Exactly what I don't
want to hit.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.786
(metallic rattling)

22:01.788 --> 22:05.723
narrator: Every bump puts more
pressure on the makeshift repair

22:05.725 --> 22:09.860
and if it falls apart the truck
could be rendered useless.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.530
(truck thumps)
- oh, that kind of bump right
there'll bust that leaf spring

22:12.532 --> 22:14.799
right the rest of the way
out of there.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.434
(metallic rattling)

22:17.837 --> 22:19.236
the whole front end is saggin'

22:19.238 --> 22:21.272
to the driver's side
in the front.

22:21.274 --> 22:22.707
It ain't good, I'm telling ya.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.608
That's not a good situation
to be in.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.012
Narrator: Finally...

22:28.014 --> 22:29.747
Todd: Woo!

22:29.749 --> 22:32.350
We are in the big trout lake.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.020
Narrator: Todd makes it to
the remote community.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.156
Todd: Don't ask me how
we made it.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.292
I have just got a little bit
of luck on my side

22:41.294 --> 22:43.427
that's for sure.
(airbrakes hiss)

22:43.429 --> 22:44.829
big trout, baby,

22:44.831 --> 22:47.965
we made it with a broken leaf
spring and everything.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.000
Unbelievable.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.971
Narrator: The load's
successfully delivered.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.707
Todd: Been another exciting
adventure, isn't it?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.109
Narrator: But now
he's gotta survive

22:58.111 --> 22:59.543
500 miles to get back home.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.980
Todd: That last leaf spring's
gotta hold on,

23:02.982 --> 23:04.415
if it don't hold on

23:04.417 --> 23:05.783
it's gonna completely buckle
underneath there

23:05.785 --> 23:07.385
and then I'm really gonna
be in a world of hurt.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.154
Narrator: And he'll have to do
it with a broken spring.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.089
- Okay!
(engine rumbles)

23:12.091 --> 23:14.091
you think it was a journey
coming in with a load,

23:14.093 --> 23:15.626
with that spring broke,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.061
now the real journey's
gonna begin

23:17.063 --> 23:18.596
gettin' all the way out
of here.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.031
It's gonna be a chore
I'm tellin' ya.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.900
Guys, better keep
your fingers crossed.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.803
(metallic clanking)

23:27.140 --> 23:29.240
narrator: While todd heads
out...

23:30.977 --> 23:33.177
300 miles to the south west...

23:33.179 --> 23:34.645
(truck rumbles)

23:36.816 --> 23:38.449
- let's roll, baby!

23:40.820 --> 23:42.520
Narrator: His fellow polar
driver's just gettin' started.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.224
- I got a load of lumber here
and I'm off to elk lake.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.694
Narrator: Art burke's racing
to get to a winter road

23:50.696 --> 23:54.098
that could be closed
at any time.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.834
The weather's gonna close,
shut us down soon

23:56.836 --> 23:59.937
because it's pretty warm, man,

23:59.939 --> 24:02.606
and the road is meltin'
as we speak.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.279
Narrator: It's 200 highway
miles just to reach

24:08.281 --> 24:11.048
the 400 mile winter road
to elk island,

24:13.419 --> 24:15.853
a trail that's on life support
due to the rising temperatures,

24:15.855 --> 24:18.989
and the company wild card
will need to hustle

24:18.991 --> 24:22.092
to have any chance to get
this load delivered.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.761
- So I got some brand new
chains under here

24:23.763 --> 24:25.429
to make the trip, buddy.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.131
Have a look, b'y.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.966
And not only that,
after I use the chains

24:28.968 --> 24:31.135
these make dandy
(bleep) buckets.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.736
(truck rumbles)

24:37.944 --> 24:40.377
well, well, well,
here we are at the ice road.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.216
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.552
Narrator: But as art reaches
the turn off...

24:50.490 --> 24:52.923
- There's a couple guys
parked here.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.959
Doesn't look good, eh.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.728
Narrator: ...He may be too late
already.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.897
Pretty warm out, b'y.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.001
She might be all over
but the crying, eh.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.940
(airbrakes hiss)

25:12.745 --> 25:14.144
I'm gonna get out
and talk to these guys

25:14.146 --> 25:16.013
and see what the road is like.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.753
How you doin', buddy?
Did you guys just come out?

25:24.156 --> 25:25.756
I just was wondering
what it was like in there?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.460
Art: Is that right?

25:36.335 --> 25:38.936
Art: Thanks, buddy.
Trucker: No problem.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.205
- Oh god.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.641
Narrator: Art's hit with
bad news:

25:43.643 --> 25:45.776
The road's too damaged to open

25:45.778 --> 25:49.113
and warm weather's expected
for the next several days.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.151
- I drove all the (bleep) the
way here just to the ice road

25:54.153 --> 25:56.387
and I can't go in because
my understanding is

25:56.389 --> 25:58.722
they shut the road down
for four days.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.192
I think this season could be
(bleep).

26:10.469 --> 26:12.836
Narrator: At the turn off
to elk island...

26:12.838 --> 26:14.305
Art: Oh god.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.808
Narrator: Art burke's been
cut off.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.544
Art: This is the ice road

26:20.546 --> 26:22.379
and I can't go in because
my understandin' is

26:22.381 --> 26:24.815
they shut the road down
for four days.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.718
Narrator: The road's closed
due to warming temperatures

26:27.720 --> 26:30.821
and the wild card's
been dealt a tough hand.

26:32.558 --> 26:35.526
- I think this season
could be (bleep).

26:35.528 --> 26:38.128
Well, look at the weather, b'y.

26:39.465 --> 26:42.399
Look, man, I mean (bleep)
it's, it's...

26:42.401 --> 26:45.269
There should be another week
or two of this left.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.637
You don't (bleep) stand around
like this,

26:46.639 --> 26:48.038
this time of year around here

26:48.040 --> 26:50.140
without freezing your nuts off
and look.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.910
I got a nice pair of shorts
in the truck.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.946
I can hardly wait to slap
them on, show my legs.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.314
(horn honks)

26:57.316 --> 27:00.784
(bleep) b'y, can you go
any (bleep) faster?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.753
Everybody's gettin' the hell
out of here, b'y,

27:02.755 --> 27:04.622
on top speed too.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.325
So I don't know
what to say here.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.693
I gotta call mark, I guess

27:09.695 --> 27:11.595
and see what the hell
I'm gonna do, buddy.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.432
Narrator: 200 miles from
winnipeg

27:15.434 --> 27:18.268
and hauling a load
that's in limbo,

27:18.270 --> 27:21.038
art calls the boss.
(phone rings)

27:22.441 --> 27:24.441
art: Well, I'll tell you
what's happenin' here, b'y.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.312
I'm at the end of the ice road
here and the thing is,

27:28.314 --> 27:29.680
I'm hearing through the vine

27:29.682 --> 27:31.382
that this is closed
for four days.

27:31.384 --> 27:32.750
Mark (on phone): I need you
to turn around

27:32.752 --> 27:34.885
and come right back
to winnipeg.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.021
Art: I drove like ten hours
up here for (bleep) all

27:37.023 --> 27:39.390
is what you're tellin' me.
Now I gotta drive ten back.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.791
Mark (on phone): Frustrating
for you,

27:40.793 --> 27:42.192
how frustrating do you think
it is for me

27:42.194 --> 27:44.595
to get you back
all the way here?

27:44.597 --> 27:46.063
You're gonna end up sittin'
there for three, four days.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.631
It's, it's too warm.
- Okay.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.033
Mark: And it's gonna stay warm
up there.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.000
- Gotcha.
(phone beeps off)

27:51.370 --> 27:53.103
so what are you gonna do?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.875
Back to winnipeg I go.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.444
Drove all this ways
for (bleep) nothing.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.246
Narrator: The load can't
be delivered

28:02.248 --> 28:04.882
and the mission must
be abandoned.

28:04.884 --> 28:08.719
Oh, you know these communities
are gonna suffer.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.455
Um, the fuel may not get in,
food may not get in,

28:11.457 --> 28:13.290
building supplies
may not get in.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.359
I don't know what to do.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.027
Narrator: It's a tough blow
for polar

28:17.029 --> 28:19.129
and devastating
for the community.

28:22.535 --> 28:23.934
(door shuts)

28:25.304 --> 28:28.238
- so I guess I'll go back
to winnipeg, my friend.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.807
(truck rumbles)

28:31.177 --> 28:32.910
away we (bleep) go.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.551
I can't finish the (bleep) job.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.391
The weather, man,
it's the first time I've ever

28:47.393 --> 28:48.759
headed in with something

28:48.761 --> 28:50.127
and never, never completed
the mission.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.729
As I always say,
"another one under my belt,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.530
another one under my belt,"

28:53.532 --> 28:56.533
well, I guess I'm not gonna put
this one under my belt, man.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.001
(truck rumbles)

29:01.807 --> 29:03.807
I'm not (bleep) happy.

29:03.809 --> 29:07.111
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep
beep-beep-beep!

29:09.014 --> 29:10.914
They're (bleep) beeps.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.218
Narrator: While one trucker
is forced to admit defeat...

29:15.554 --> 29:18.222
200 miles to the north east...

29:19.592 --> 29:21.024
(water splashes, hard thump)
- whoa!

29:21.026 --> 29:23.093
Narrator: Lisa kelly's trying
to win the battle

29:23.095 --> 29:24.561
on the road sandy lake,

29:25.898 --> 29:28.532
(rattling thump)
- ah!

29:28.534 --> 29:31.668
Narrator: Slogging her way
through the last wet 20 miles.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.103
(truck rumbles)

29:35.508 --> 29:36.940
- it's a beautiful day for
a drive in the countryside.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.077
Narrator: But the deteriorating
trail

29:40.079 --> 29:42.513
is punishing her truck
at every turn.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.548
(water splashes, engine rumbles)

29:46.085 --> 29:47.818
(loud thumps)

29:47.820 --> 29:51.221
- it's hard to hold the stick
in the gear

29:51.223 --> 29:54.958
when I'm flying so high
I need both hands to hang on.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.428
And steer.

29:59.732 --> 30:01.365
Narrator: With the path caked
in mud,

30:01.367 --> 30:03.734
gaining traction ain't easy...

30:03.736 --> 30:05.235
(truck rumbles)

30:05.237 --> 30:08.505
- here is a hill.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.607
Narrator: Especially
on inclines.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.248
Narrator: So the best way
to try and conquer it....

30:18.250 --> 30:20.818
Is with plenty of added speed.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.620
(loud rattling thuds)

30:29.094 --> 30:30.828
(engine revs loudly)

30:30.830 --> 30:32.629
(loud boom)
- ah! Woo!

30:35.334 --> 30:37.100
Damn it! It came out
of gear again!

30:37.102 --> 30:38.535
(gear grinds)

30:38.537 --> 30:40.070
at least that happened
at the top.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.339
Popped out of gear at the top.

30:42.341 --> 30:46.109
I'm pretty sure the truck went
sideways 'cause I sure did.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.378
Narrator: With the hill
behind her...

30:48.380 --> 30:51.348
Lisa: I'm seeing the signs
of civilization.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.751
Narrator: Lisa reaches
sandy lake.

30:56.755 --> 31:00.324
- I'm pulling into the offload,
mission accomplished.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.759
Narrator: And despite the
challenge of the melted road

31:02.761 --> 31:06.730
she bags the biggest payday for
her small company all season.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.433
Lisa: It wasn't easy.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.869
I have never had the truck
floored the entire trip

31:11.871 --> 31:13.337
trying to make it through
the mud,

31:13.339 --> 31:16.406
but I got it delivered,
they were happy.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.477
All right, let's get outta here.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.613
Narrator: While lisa locks
one down,

31:24.216 --> 31:26.049
100 miles to the east...

31:28.320 --> 31:31.221
On the road out
of big trout lake...

31:31.223 --> 31:33.323
- Job's accomplished
and I'm back on the ice road

31:33.325 --> 31:35.192
headed right back out.

31:35.194 --> 31:38.128
Narrator: The competition's
holding on by a thread.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.197
Todd: Hopefully this little
truck holds up to the torture

31:40.199 --> 31:42.299
I'm about to put it through.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.568
Narrator: Polar driver
todd dewey's trying to drive

31:44.570 --> 31:46.303
500 miles back to winnipeg

31:48.674 --> 31:51.541
with a busted leaf spring held
together by a mere tow strap.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.943
(metallic groan)

31:52.945 --> 31:54.344
todd: It's already been
stressful enough,

31:54.346 --> 31:56.246
but then to add this (bleep)
to my plate,

31:56.248 --> 31:59.049
yeah, that's a long day.
That's a hard (bleep) push

31:59.051 --> 32:01.251
and now we got to fight
all the way back

32:01.253 --> 32:03.153
with a broken leaf spring.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.955
(metallic creaking)

32:04.957 --> 32:06.790
(truck rattles)

32:06.792 --> 32:08.558
(loud thud)

32:11.997 --> 32:14.631
this road has completely gone
to rat (bleep)

32:14.633 --> 32:17.467
and it's gonna be shut down
100 percent.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.736
I honestly don't know
what's gonna happen.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.305
(loud bang)
hang on!

32:21.307 --> 32:22.806
Damn it.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.908
(metallic creaking)

32:24.910 --> 32:26.310
(bleep)

32:27.680 --> 32:29.413
if I sound like I'm swearin'
like art I am,

32:29.415 --> 32:31.214
because I'm legitimately
not feelin' good

32:31.216 --> 32:33.784
about this trip at all.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.086
(tires crunch)

32:36.088 --> 32:37.821
(metallic groan)

32:37.823 --> 32:40.290
I have to keep going until
I get back out of this ice road

32:40.292 --> 32:43.026
before it's closed
all the way down.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.829
(truck roars)

32:48.300 --> 32:50.000
narrator: As todd's run
continues

32:50.002 --> 32:51.435
on a wing and a prayer,

32:52.972 --> 32:54.438
200 miles to the west...

32:57.343 --> 32:59.776
His fellow polar driver's
trying to close in

32:59.778 --> 33:01.345
on his own destination.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.879
(loud thumps)

33:04.216 --> 33:08.085
alex: Oh, we're about
50 kilometers down the road,

33:08.087 --> 33:10.420
spring is basically here

33:10.422 --> 33:13.223
and this road is rotting away
underneath us.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.860
Narrator: Alex debogorski's
approaching the last stretch

33:16.862 --> 33:18.562
to saint theresa point

33:18.564 --> 33:21.865
with the town's final haul
of the season.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.800
(truck thumps)

33:23.802 --> 33:25.736
(truck rattles, thumps)

33:27.139 --> 33:28.805
but it's also one of
the bumpiest patches

33:28.807 --> 33:30.507
of the entire trail.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.279
And his 12-ton haul of lumber
is taking a beating.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.148
(wood creaks)

33:38.150 --> 33:40.217
- the frame of this trailer's
closer to the ground

33:40.219 --> 33:41.818
than most trailers.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.689
So I gotta watch out
for hummocks or for bumps

33:45.691 --> 33:48.091
that are high enough
to catch the frame.

33:48.093 --> 33:52.396
♪ ♪

33:52.398 --> 33:55.132
this is my last challenge
before saint theresa point.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.801
I get across this and I get
my load delivered.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.405
Here we go.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.109
(truck rumbles, loud thud,
metallic clank)

34:06.111 --> 34:07.511
oh!

34:09.281 --> 34:11.515
(lumber groans)

34:12.951 --> 34:14.584
(loud thud)

34:14.586 --> 34:16.286
(tires crunch)

34:16.288 --> 34:19.256
those bumps there are pretty
hard on the load.

34:19.258 --> 34:21.658
This up and down
is hard on me too.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.830
My back's sore already.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.833
(loud creaking)

34:29.835 --> 34:32.702
lots of other things to break
beside that load of lumber.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.104
(loud thumps)

34:34.106 --> 34:35.539
might end up taking
the suspension out

34:35.541 --> 34:38.575
before you'd lose the lumber.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.911
(metallic clank)

34:40.913 --> 34:42.279
(thumps)

34:42.281 --> 34:43.680
it's not just the load
that we can lose,

34:43.682 --> 34:46.349
we can, uh, lose the truck
or the trailer.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.918
(truck rumbles)

34:49.788 --> 34:52.322
(clattering thud)
oh! Could be lettin' go.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.992
(booming thud)

34:55.994 --> 34:57.394
(booming thuds)

34:57.396 --> 34:59.529
(huge boom)
oh!

35:04.970 --> 35:07.737
Narrator: On the path
to saint theresa point...

35:09.074 --> 35:10.974
(tires crunch, thump)

35:10.976 --> 35:12.409
(lumber groans)

35:12.411 --> 35:13.810
it's not just the load that
we can lose

35:13.812 --> 35:16.179
we can, uh, lose the truck
or the trailer.

35:16.181 --> 35:18.014
Narrator: Things could
be falling apart

35:18.016 --> 35:20.183
for alex debogorski.

35:20.185 --> 35:23.353
(clattering thumps)
- oh! Could be lettin' go.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.225
(loud thumps, tires skid)

35:28.227 --> 35:29.626
(loud thud) whoa!

35:29.628 --> 35:31.061
(lumber thumps)

35:32.798 --> 35:34.898
(engine rumbles)

35:34.900 --> 35:36.533
whoa. Don't do that.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.003
(lumber thumps)

35:40.005 --> 35:42.305
it seems to me
I'm missing lumber.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.441
(truck rumbles to a stop)

35:46.945 --> 35:49.746
narrator: Even with the
experienced veteran at the wheel

35:49.748 --> 35:52.883
alex: Still looks in good shape.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.651
Narrator: The rough road
proves too much

35:54.653 --> 35:57.053
to keep the entire load intact.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.856
Alex: That was a very
close call.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.725
It scared me half to death.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.693
(crank clicks)

36:03.695 --> 36:06.129
desperately I wanna keep
this thing on here.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.564
(straps flick)

36:08.867 --> 36:11.067
narrator: With the lumber
back in place

36:11.069 --> 36:14.538
the old pro hits the trail
for the final five miles.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.874
- We're off again.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.509
(truck rumbles)

36:19.511 --> 36:22.479
just stay on the road,
keep rollin'.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.216
Keep the load from fallin' off.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.151
Narrator: As alex comes around
the bend...

36:31.123 --> 36:33.557
Alex: We got here.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.192
Narrator: Saint theresa point
appears on the horizon.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.762
(beeping)
- I'm gonna stop here.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.263
Narrator: And the legend
delivers

36:40.265 --> 36:43.567
the last haul of the season
for the tiny community.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.869
Alex: Now unload.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.270
(door shuts)

36:47.272 --> 36:49.039
I had a challenging trip,
but I made it in the end.

36:51.343 --> 36:54.010
The customer doesn't care how
much drama I went through.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.479
They just want their load
and they got it.

36:58.951 --> 37:01.051
I survived. (chuckles)

37:02.454 --> 37:04.554
(door shuts)

37:04.556 --> 37:07.157
narrator: Alex chalks up a
victory against the early melt,

37:10.596 --> 37:13.263
but as night falls
on the winter roads,

37:15.601 --> 37:17.634
on the trail back to winnipeg
out of big trout lake...

37:17.636 --> 37:19.069
(loud thumps)

37:20.439 --> 37:22.672
todd: Oh, this road is (bleep).

37:24.543 --> 37:26.977
Narrator: Todd dewey's still
at war.

37:26.979 --> 37:29.212
(metallic creaks,
truck rumbles)

37:29.214 --> 37:31.648
- pushin' all night through
this ice road.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.351
Just gotta last a little bit
longer.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.320
Narrator: His busted leaf
spring's held together

37:37.322 --> 37:39.155
by a tow strap,

37:39.157 --> 37:42.626
and there's 200 more miles
of assault ahead.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.594
(loud thump)
- hang on!

37:47.199 --> 37:49.299
See if we can make it.
I'll keep hammer down,

37:49.301 --> 37:52.402
keep pushin' all the way
through as far as I can.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.405
Make this truck go until she
absolutely can't go any more.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.741
(truck rumbles)

37:59.077 --> 38:00.610
(loud thud)

38:02.314 --> 38:04.547
holy (bleep) hang on!
Holy (bleep)!

38:05.951 --> 38:07.651
(metallic screeching)

38:08.987 --> 38:10.387
(metallic groan)

38:10.389 --> 38:12.355
(truck rumbles)

38:13.725 --> 38:16.760
I've never seen so many soft
spots on one road before

38:16.762 --> 38:19.729
and all that tells me is that...

38:19.731 --> 38:22.932
This season is right
at its deadline.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.835
The clock is tickin'
and it's about to shut down.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.871
(truck groans)

38:27.873 --> 38:31.007
(clattering thumps)
oh, goodness.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.542
(metallic banging)

38:34.479 --> 38:36.846
(truck rumbles, engine revs)

38:38.583 --> 38:40.350
(tires crunch, metallic thump)

38:40.352 --> 38:41.785
(loud thumps)

38:43.155 --> 38:44.854
oh my goodness sakes, man.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.123
(metallic screeches, groans)

38:47.125 --> 38:48.525
I tell you what, if I was
looking for adventure

38:48.527 --> 38:50.827
I got one now, didn't I?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.262
(truck rumbles)

38:53.632 --> 38:55.265
(loud thump)
- hold on!

38:57.135 --> 38:58.968
(loud metallic groans)

39:01.039 --> 39:02.439
(loud boom) oh!

39:02.441 --> 39:05.141
(electrical sparking)
(static crackles)

39:10.949 --> 39:13.817
narrator: On the road out
of big trout...

39:13.819 --> 39:15.652
(truck rumbles)

39:15.654 --> 39:17.620
todd: Hold on!

39:17.622 --> 39:19.556
Narrator: Todd dewey's
at the end of his road.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.958
(metallic groaning)

39:21.960 --> 39:23.526
(huge boom) oh!

39:23.528 --> 39:26.196
(electrical sparking)
(static crackles)

39:28.667 --> 39:31.768
(truck idles)

39:33.739 --> 39:35.705
(door opens)

39:37.109 --> 39:38.508
- unbelievable.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.212
Oh, you're (bleep) me.

39:46.118 --> 39:48.318
I can't (bleep) believe it.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.120
(bleep)

39:50.122 --> 39:52.021
(liquid splashes)

39:52.023 --> 39:53.990
narrator: Over the years...

39:55.360 --> 39:56.793
(truck rumbles)

39:58.163 --> 39:59.596
alex: We're done.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.365
(tires skid)

40:02.367 --> 40:03.733
narrators: The drivers
and their trucks

40:03.735 --> 40:05.635
have taken a pounding
on the winter roads.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.771
Art: I jack knifed
the truck, buddy.

40:09.474 --> 40:10.874
- (bleep)

40:15.680 --> 40:17.514
- yeah. I'd love to push ya.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.149
Narrator: Yet they've always
managed to find a way

40:19.151 --> 40:20.850
to keep their rigs moving.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.652
(loud bang)

40:22.654 --> 40:24.621
no matter the challenge.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.823
- (chuckles)

40:26.825 --> 40:28.725
(truck clatters)

40:30.162 --> 40:31.594
- unbelievable, man.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.230
Narrator: But the ice road
truckers have never experienced

40:34.232 --> 40:36.900
a season as brutal as this one.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.570
(liquid splashes)

40:42.541 --> 40:43.973
(hood cranks)

40:45.310 --> 40:46.776
(liquid splashes)

40:48.113 --> 40:49.512
- you know, I got a broken
leaf spring,

40:49.514 --> 40:50.914
now on top of it I hit a rock

40:50.916 --> 40:53.149
and it's busted a hole
clean in my radiator.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.584
(liquid splashes)

40:56.688 --> 40:58.321
(hood creaks closed)

40:59.691 --> 41:02.559
and the road has absolutely
(bleep) beat me down.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.562
It's beaten my (bleep) truck
down and, uh,

41:05.564 --> 41:08.164
I can honestly say for
the first (bleep) time

41:08.166 --> 41:09.532
I've actually been
(bleep) defeated

41:09.534 --> 41:11.701
on the (bleep) ice road.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.638
There's only one way this
(bleep) truck is goin' home

41:15.640 --> 41:19.175
and that's on a tow truck.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.678
Narrator: Todd's forced
to throw in the towel.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.519
And six hours later...

41:30.856 --> 41:32.288
(horn beeps)

41:32.290 --> 41:35.124
the tow truck arrives
to pull polar's top dog

41:35.126 --> 41:37.293
all the way back to winnipeg.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.728
(beeping)

41:42.100 --> 41:43.466
to basically sum it up;

41:43.468 --> 41:44.901
it's been one of the most
craziest seasons

41:44.903 --> 41:47.003
due to mother nature.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.372
The weather will not cooperate
with us.

41:49.374 --> 41:51.574
When there's not enough snow

41:51.576 --> 41:54.043
you can't fill the holes in

41:54.045 --> 41:56.613
you really can't truck on it.

41:56.615 --> 41:58.014
Okay.

42:01.486 --> 42:04.120
Narrator: The cost of truck
repairs will be massive

42:04.122 --> 42:06.055
and so will the tow bill,

42:06.057 --> 42:08.458
a nearly 200 mile haul.

42:08.460 --> 42:11.261
Man on radio: (laughing) okay.

42:11.263 --> 42:13.863
Narrator: El nino's wrath
has created road conditions

42:13.865 --> 42:15.398
like never before.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.302
Todd: This ice road has kicked
my (bleep) this season.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.870
(truck rumbles)

42:22.307 --> 42:25.074
narrator: And the season
still ain't over yet.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.509
(chains clink)

42:27.913 --> 42:29.312
next time...

42:30.682 --> 42:32.115
On... "ice road truckers"...

42:32.117 --> 42:33.483
- How's everybody doin'
back there?

42:33.485 --> 42:34.884
The road's getting rough.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.553
Steph: Hammer down,
boys and girls, hammer down.

42:36.555 --> 42:37.987
Narrator: Two companies...

42:37.989 --> 42:39.455
Steph: Get 'er done.

42:39.457 --> 42:41.558
Narrator: One convoy...

42:41.560 --> 42:42.959
- Pretty epic.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.894
Narrator: As rivals come
together...

42:44.896 --> 42:46.262
(loud thud) mark: Whoa!

42:46.264 --> 42:47.664
- You're drivin', come on!

42:47.666 --> 42:49.065
- Well, what the (bleep)
you want me to do?!

42:49.067 --> 42:50.466
- Take it easy!

42:50.468 --> 42:52.135
Narrator: For the toughest
mission of the season...

42:52.137 --> 42:53.970
(engine whines, loud thump)
steph: Oh god!

42:53.972 --> 42:55.638
(truck thunders, bangs)

42:55.640 --> 42:57.206
darrell: I smell some wiring.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.608
Narrator: And the action...

42:58.610 --> 43:00.009
- What's goin' on?

43:00.011 --> 43:01.511
Darrell: Holy (bleep)!

43:01.513 --> 43:02.912
Narrator: Heats up.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.347
Mark: Darrell, stop the (bleep)
truck!

43:04.349 --> 43:06.215
Lisa: Mark jumped out!

43:06.217 --> 43:07.984
Mark: Fire! Fire!
