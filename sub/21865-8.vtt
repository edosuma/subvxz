18:35.166 --> 18:36.600
She said she had to go
to the nursery.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.900
No signs of the husband yet.
Thanks.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.867
(babies crying)

18:47.900 --> 18:48.934
Hey, hey, hey.

18:48.934 --> 18:52.367
Look... I just want to hear
your side of things.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.500
Okay?
(elevator bell dings)

18:56.500 --> 18:59.133
It's not safe for you here.
Come on.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.133
Duck!
(alarm blaring)

19:08.266 --> 19:10.367
(phone ringing)

19:10.367 --> 19:11.367
Hello?

19:11.367 --> 19:12.367
It's the wife.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.266
She's the killer.

19:13.266 --> 19:15.800
Yeah, hell of a plot twist,
Scorsese.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.500
Come on, Jerry, we know
that your wife stabbed

19:22.500 --> 19:25.600
Tony Bonesaw right before
going into labor,

19:25.600 --> 19:27.633
and you, the good doctor,
tried to patch him up.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.867
Adriana?
No. No!

19:29.867 --> 19:30.800
She would never...
Hey, hey, hey,

19:30.800 --> 19:32.867
do you have any idea
who you're married to?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.500
A woman who loves me
very much.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.467
A woman who was hired
to kill you.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.667
Well, why not both,
Detective?

19:41.667 --> 19:44.900
Adriana contains
multitudes.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.867
That's one way of looking at it.

19:45.867 --> 19:48.433
One night she sidled up
to me at a bar...

19:48.433 --> 19:50.934
He's gonna take
the rap for her.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.834
Well, I'm not charging
an innocent man,

19:52.834 --> 19:54.700
so if you need him
for your RICO case,

19:54.700 --> 19:56.300
Agent Graves...
Unfortunately,

19:56.300 --> 19:57.233
the Fifth Amendment bars us

19:57.233 --> 20:00.300
from trying Truno again
for what Jerry saw.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.233
He's useless to me
as a witness.
Useless?

20:02.233 --> 20:05.533
You flew cross‐country
to make sure we arrested him.

20:05.533 --> 20:07.600
You used us to
get to Adriana.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.433
Nailing Frank Truno is no joke.

20:09.433 --> 20:12.233
Every time I'm close,
he walks, but his girlfriend

20:12.233 --> 20:14.500
and top contractor,
I'm betting she has the dirt

20:14.500 --> 20:15.900
to put him away.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.166
And if her testimony is solid,

20:18.166 --> 20:19.934
I'm authorized
to offer her WitSec,

20:19.934 --> 20:21.600
immunity,

20:21.600 --> 20:23.500
anything.
It's been hours.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.867
She's probably
in Mexico by now.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.867
JERRY: That's when
she finally came clean,

20:27.867 --> 20:31.200
said, "A guy like you, Jerry,

20:31.200 --> 20:34.367
you don't kill him,
you marry him."

20:34.367 --> 20:36.767
Aw, a true shotgun wedding.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.667
JERRY: It's not perfect,
(phone ringing)

20:38.667 --> 20:41.900
but isn't love
always complicated?

20:41.900 --> 20:43.367
Excuse me, guys.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.500
Hey.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.934
Any chance you're free tonight?

20:46.934 --> 20:49.900
Uh, maybe.
What'd you have in mind?

20:49.900 --> 20:51.300
You want me to retile
the bathroom

20:51.300 --> 20:52.567
or fix your garbage disposal?

20:52.567 --> 20:53.700
You and Ben can do
whatever you like.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.266
You're babysitting.

20:55.266 --> 20:58.266
Oh.
Another date.

20:58.266 --> 20:59.934
Another date, same guy.

20:59.934 --> 21:01.934
Well, just remember
it's a school night.

21:01.934 --> 21:04.233
Will do, <i>Dad.</i>

21:04.233 --> 21:05.633
So, how about it?

21:05.633 --> 21:07.734
You want to corrupt my son
for a few hours?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.900
Yeah, I'd love to.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.467
So, what are we talking,
three‐beer limit?

21:10.467 --> 21:11.767
For him or for you?

21:11.767 --> 21:13.400
Oh, I'll be drunk
when I get there.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.133
(hammer pounding)

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
(gasps)

21:22.500 --> 21:25.633
McNeile!
Don't you scare me like that.

21:25.633 --> 21:26.734
(whispering):
Simple wood and nails

21:26.734 --> 21:28.033
won't put an end to this.

21:28.033 --> 21:31.700
It's time to get high‐tech.
No, I don't even
want to know.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.600
I was coerced into promising
that I would leave it alone.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.867
You can't neglect
something like this, Rog.

21:37.867 --> 21:38.934
It's how tooth decay starts.

21:38.934 --> 21:43.200
One day you don't brush,
next day you're dead.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.633
Of tooth decay?

21:44.633 --> 21:46.300
Of tooth decay.

21:46.300 --> 21:49.633
They're in Riana's
room right now.

21:49.633 --> 21:50.734
If we don't put
a stop to this,

21:50.734 --> 21:52.934
we could wind up
in family photos.

21:52.934 --> 21:53.834
Together.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.200
Never.
Well, then,

21:55.200 --> 21:56.333
the question is, Roger,

21:56.333 --> 21:57.767
what are you prepared to do?

22:01.333 --> 22:02.767
ROBBIE (over phone):
Our dads are in the backyard.

22:02.767 --> 22:03.834
RIANA:
That's why we're in my room.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.433
They know we're out here.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.166
This is so wrong.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.767
H‐How did you even...
Shh.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.767
I bugged his phone.

22:12.834 --> 22:15.500
Never thought
I'd say this, but...

22:15.500 --> 22:18.166
I'm starting
to respect you, McNeile.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.300
Let's roll.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.900
No, no, no, no.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.834
Patience.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.367
Intent will only take us so far.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.567
We need incriminating evidence.

22:26.567 --> 22:27.433
RIANA:
The dance is so far away.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.800
I don't know
if I can wait that long.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.133
ROBBIE:
Why don't we fool around now?

22:35.200 --> 22:36.934
Aha. Busted, Dad.

22:36.934 --> 22:39.233
RIANA: You were in
on this, too?

22:39.233 --> 22:40.667
(scoffs)
Why am I not surprised?

22:40.667 --> 22:42.200
Uh, what? In on it?
No, no, no.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.867
I‐No... I‐It was his idea.

22:43.867 --> 22:45.667
What? What...?
I was coerced.

22:46.934 --> 22:47.734
I'll call you.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.400
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.367
You had a boy in your room.

22:50.367 --> 22:51.433
You broke the rules.

22:51.433 --> 22:52.900
I pretend‐had a boy in my room.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.533
Yeah, well,
you're for‐real grounded.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.734
What?
Yep.

22:55.734 --> 22:57.567
You invaded my privacy.

22:57.567 --> 22:58.867
Starting now.

22:58.867 --> 22:59.834
Two weeks.

22:59.834 --> 23:00.767
Two weeks?

23:00.767 --> 23:02.900
But homecoming is, like,

23:02.900 --> 23:03.800
next week.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.700
Oh, right, the dance.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.166
I forgot about that.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.266
Oh, well.

23:08.266 --> 23:10.600
I guess you're just gonna have
to do without it.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.934
You're only doing this to try
to stop me from seeing Robbie.

23:12.934 --> 23:13.667
No, I'm not.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.266
You can see him
out the window.

23:16.266 --> 23:17.367
Trapped face.

23:17.367 --> 23:19.533
The original emoji.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.834
(door closes)

23:24.433 --> 23:29.233
Man, if Mom found out about
this, she'd be so mad.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.633
Remember you said that.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.633
She's not gonna find out.
Yep.

23:33.533 --> 23:35.166
(car approaching)

23:37.200 --> 23:38.233
Uh‐oh.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.166
Operation Bedtime is a go.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.266
All right, how long
have you been asleep?

23:42.266 --> 23:44.166
Uh, two hours.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.266
Deedle‐eedle‐ee.

23:45.266 --> 23:46.533
All right, go, go, go.

23:48.433 --> 23:49.667
Good night.
(laughs)

23:49.667 --> 23:52.100
I had a great time.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.934
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.300
Am I interrupting?

23:56.300 --> 23:58.200
You are.
No, not at all.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.400
Uh...

23:59.400 --> 24:00.667
(laughs softly)

24:01.700 --> 24:03.367
I'll call you later.

24:03.367 --> 24:04.600
Uh, mm‐hmm. Okay.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.100
You better.
(clicks tongue)

24:06.934 --> 24:09.100
(sighs, chuckles)

24:10.433 --> 24:12.600
Okay. His name's Chip.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.700
He loves water polo
and turtlenecks.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.567
His name's Chad.
Chad.

24:17.567 --> 24:20.266
MOLLY: Just sold his company
for five million dollars.

24:20.266 --> 24:21.433
Impressive.

24:21.433 --> 24:22.533
I'll do a background check
on him.

24:22.533 --> 24:23.767
Martin, stop it.

24:23.767 --> 24:24.900
Come on, I just
want, you know,

24:24.900 --> 24:25.834
I don't want you to get hurt.

24:25.834 --> 24:27.834
Well, you date someone,
you might get hurt.

24:27.834 --> 24:28.900
That's the way it goes.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.400
And I'm a big girl,
I can take care of myself.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.333
I know you can
take care of yourself...

24:32.333 --> 24:34.467
Martin. I want you
in mine and Ben's lives.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.266
But if you're gonna be my
friend, then be my friend.

24:37.266 --> 24:41.734
Not my father, or some
self‐anointed protector.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.467
You're right.

24:45.667 --> 24:46.867
Have a good night.

24:46.867 --> 24:48.233
Wait.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.633
What?
This is for you.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.500
(gasps, sniffs)

24:52.500 --> 24:53.900
Chicken Parm.

24:53.900 --> 24:55.633
It's a thank‐you
for babysitting Ben.

24:55.633 --> 24:57.633
Ah, thank you. Kid's great.

24:57.633 --> 24:59.200
He's a natural at craps.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.200
And, all the girls
at the strip club loved him.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.266
(laughs softly)

25:02.266 --> 25:03.300
Good night, Martin.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.367
Good night.

25:04.367 --> 25:06.867
(phone ringing)

25:09.900 --> 25:11.934
ADRIANA: You know my husband
didn't kill Tony Bonesaw.

25:11.934 --> 25:13.600
All right, then why
are you letting him

25:13.600 --> 25:14.734
take the fall for everything?

25:14.734 --> 25:16.367
If I turn myself in,

25:16.367 --> 25:17.934
both Jerry and I end up in jail.

25:17.934 --> 25:21.834
We never see our daughter
or each other again.

25:21.834 --> 25:23.767
What if I told you
there was a way

25:23.767 --> 25:25.400
the family could stay together?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.233
All three of you. WitSec.

25:27.233 --> 25:30.567
We both know city cops
can't grant WitSec.

25:30.567 --> 25:32.300
But there's an FBI agent in town

25:32.300 --> 25:34.567
who's got a grudge
for your ex‐boyfriend.

25:34.567 --> 25:37.100
If you're willing to talk,
I think he'll make a deal.

25:39.266 --> 25:40.934
Adriana?

25:40.934 --> 25:42.533
(engine starts)

25:43.433 --> 25:45.567
(car approaching)

25:48.266 --> 25:50.800
(brakes squeak)

25:50.800 --> 25:55.400
If I go with you, promise you'll
help me keep my family safe?

25:55.400 --> 25:57.867
I promise.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.467
PAULIE:
<i>Welcome to L. A., Frank.</i>

26:11.467 --> 26:14.800
You screwed up, Paulie.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.567
The cops showed, and
then she ran away.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.834
She's a pro at this stuff.

26:19.834 --> 26:23.100
Pull over, Paulie.

26:39.867 --> 26:43.266
(Paulie shouts)

26:43.266 --> 26:45.200
(Frank grunting)

26:48.166 --> 26:50.266
(siren wailing in distance)

26:50.266 --> 26:52.533
ADRIANA: Frank Truno
is a total psychopath.

26:52.533 --> 26:55.533
He's killed more people
than I can even count.

26:55.533 --> 26:58.200
First, there was
Blue Eyes Murphy,

26:58.200 --> 27:01.266
then, Big John the Greek,
in Bensonhurst.

27:01.266 --> 27:03.200
Want to say 2010.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.266
RIGGS:
Wait, wait.

27:04.266 --> 27:05.734
So there are two
John the Greeks?

27:05.734 --> 27:06.767
There were.

27:06.767 --> 27:08.433
GRAVES:
You were given these orders

27:08.433 --> 27:11.266
by Frank Truno, personally?

27:11.266 --> 27:12.667
No, um...

27:12.667 --> 27:15.233
he always went through
an intermediary,

27:15.233 --> 27:17.767
but everyone knew
who was calling the shots.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.166
How about when you
guys were dating?

27:19.166 --> 27:21.166
Did you ever overhear anything?

27:21.166 --> 27:23.266
Frank never talked shop with me.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.533
He compartmentalized.

27:24.533 --> 27:26.767
A true psycho.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.667
Why are you here? Where's Eva?

27:34.667 --> 27:35.533
Don't worry. Eva's safe.

27:35.533 --> 27:37.700
I made a deal to keep
us all together.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.800
Detective?

27:39.800 --> 27:40.900
Yeah.

27:40.900 --> 27:43.400
WitSec isn't an entitlement.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.367
It must be earned.

27:44.367 --> 27:46.900
Adriana didn't offer
anything valuable.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.800
But she did confess
to her own crimes,

27:48.800 --> 27:50.233
including the homicide.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.233
What the hell are you saying?

27:51.233 --> 27:53.467
I can't go back
to the Bureau empty‐handed.

27:53.467 --> 27:55.734
She's being transferred
to our custody.

27:55.734 --> 27:56.867
RIGGS:
So that's it?

27:56.867 --> 27:58.667
You're just gonna give up
on bringing Truno down?

27:58.667 --> 28:00.233
Look, I promise you,
Detective Riggs,

28:00.233 --> 28:02.533
if you can give me
a real shot at Truno,

28:02.533 --> 28:05.133
I'll make any deal you want.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.266
(siren wailing in distance)

28:14.266 --> 28:15.667
(horn honking)

28:15.667 --> 28:17.266
GRAZIANO: Okay.
How about in act four,

28:17.266 --> 28:18.700
they throw the body
in the freezer?

28:18.700 --> 28:19.767
Mm‐hmm.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.767
They don't realize
the cold keeps him alive.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.166
SCORSESE: Yeah, that works.
Yeah, finally, all right.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.200
Our story got some zatz,
you know?

28:25.200 --> 28:27.667
But I feel like we're
still missing something.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.367
Dream sequence.
Yeah, maybe.

28:29.367 --> 28:30.900
But I don't know,
we need, like, um...

28:30.900 --> 28:33.734
We need, like, a better, uh,
like, a better bad guy.

28:33.734 --> 28:35.233
You know,
someone who can

28:35.233 --> 28:36.567
like, send chills
down your spine

28:36.567 --> 28:37.900
with, like,
just a look.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.567
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

28:39.567 --> 28:40.734
FRANK:
Nicky G.

28:40.734 --> 28:43.400
Long time, huh?

28:43.400 --> 28:44.900
Frank? Wow.

28:44.900 --> 28:45.734
(laughing):
How you doing?

28:45.734 --> 28:48.300
What, uh...
what brings you to L. A.?

28:48.300 --> 28:49.567
Me?

28:49.567 --> 28:51.900
Uh, I'm just thinking about
getting into the movie business.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.166
(laughs softly)
Really? 'Cause that's fantastic.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.834
We... we're writing a script,
Nicky and I, actually...

28:55.834 --> 28:58.100
Bernard, meet Frank Truno.
Yeah.

29:00.533 --> 29:01.934
How you doing?

29:01.934 --> 29:03.734
You working
on a script with him?

29:03.734 --> 29:05.200
Uh...
This it here?

29:06.400 --> 29:07.133
What's it about?

29:07.133 --> 29:09.934
It's, uh... it's animated.

29:09.934 --> 29:11.500
It's an animated, uh,

29:11.500 --> 29:12.066
musical.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.500
Yeah, like a cartoon.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.934
Yeah, it's like, just...

29:15.934 --> 29:17.800
Well, that sounds about
right, coming from you.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.934
Right?

29:19.934 --> 29:22.333
♪ Da‐da, da‐da, da‐da. ♪
(chuckles)

29:22.333 --> 29:23.667
Do me a favor.

29:23.667 --> 29:24.600
Beat it, will you?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.867
Cecil B. DeMoron.
Yeah.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.767
Nicky, I'll see you.

29:30.266 --> 29:32.533
Did you hear?

29:32.533 --> 29:34.233
The doctor's still alive.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.467
I know.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.800
Do me a favor.
Find him for me, all right?

29:38.834 --> 29:40.200
I'd like to, Frank.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.867
I really would.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.500
But I'm out
of that line of work.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.800
What, you're
a big shot writer now?

29:44.800 --> 29:45.834
Is that it?
No.

29:45.834 --> 29:48.333
Yeah. Right.
Yeah?

29:48.333 --> 29:52.400
I always heard they treated
writers like crap in this town.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.333
Not always.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.834
But it happens.

29:55.834 --> 29:58.200
Do me a favor, Nick.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.100
Find the doctor.

30:09.333 --> 30:13.533
You're free to go,
Dr. Johnson.

30:13.533 --> 30:16.667
This way.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.900
TRISH: What the hell
is going on?

30:18.900 --> 30:22.734
Riana and Robbie are going
to that dance together.

30:22.734 --> 30:24.266
No, she is not going, okay?

30:24.266 --> 30:25.367
She is grounded.

30:25.367 --> 30:29.333
She broke the house rule
by having a boy in her room.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.333
And rules are rules.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.600
They asked me first,
and I said yes.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.367
This is crazy, Roger.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.734
You might not like McNeile,
but she is not dating him.

30:38.734 --> 30:41.333
Yeah, but...
You‐you know what my father
thought about you at first?

30:41.333 --> 30:42.633
Your father?
You father loves me.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.567
<i>Now.</i>

30:43.567 --> 30:46.300
But when we first started
dating, he...

30:46.300 --> 30:47.900
he was not for it.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.200
What? W‐What,
because I was a cop?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.233
I understand that.

30:50.233 --> 30:51.834
No, that wasn't it.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.834
What‐what was it?

30:53.834 --> 30:55.533
He thought you were too safe

30:55.533 --> 30:57.266
and anxious

30:57.266 --> 30:59.834
for his daring,
see‐the‐whole‐world daughter.

30:59.834 --> 31:01.633
Safe?
Mm‐hmm.

31:01.633 --> 31:05.233
And he was worried that I might
grow tired of you.

31:06.867 --> 31:08.600
But I haven't.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.100
Not yet.

31:10.934 --> 31:14.800
Make it right with Riana, huh?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.233
Thank you.

31:23.834 --> 31:25.633
GRAVES: Since you
signed a confession,

31:25.633 --> 31:28.800
your husband was released to CPC
to pick up your child.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.333
Once Detective Riggs signs
your confession,

31:31.333 --> 31:34.300
all accessory charges
against him will be dropped.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.100
(elevator bell dings)

31:50.400 --> 31:52.633
Hey, Riggs.
Yeah.

31:52.633 --> 31:55.867
Would you describe me
as someone who's safe?

31:55.867 --> 31:57.734
Yeah. That's a fair description.

31:57.734 --> 32:00.934
Uh, this is a good "safe,"
or a bad "safe"?

32:00.934 --> 32:03.233
Eh, there is no good "safe."

32:10.233 --> 32:12.800
(elevator bell dings)

32:27.200 --> 32:28.300
GRAVES: Adriana's headed
for the Spotlight Hotel.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.567
Our intel has Frank Truno
checking in there yesterday.

32:31.567 --> 32:32.367
You guys hear that?

32:32.367 --> 32:34.233
Uh, we're still
five blocks away.

32:34.233 --> 32:36.934
Hey, Cap, those Bureau cars
have radios?

32:36.934 --> 32:39.100
(siren wailing)

32:46.166 --> 32:46.934
Adriana.

32:46.934 --> 32:48.934
Adriana, listen to me.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.467
(sighs)

32:51.834 --> 32:52.767
What?

32:52.767 --> 32:55.200
Killing Frank's not
gonna solve anything.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.567
It'll keep Jerry and Eva safe.

32:56.567 --> 32:59.633
No. You do this,
it's all over.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.200
It's already over.

33:11.633 --> 33:13.266
All right.

33:14.934 --> 33:16.734
(siren wailing)

33:21.800 --> 33:23.734
Ow.

33:25.734 --> 33:27.867
Wait, if I help you,
they'll kill me.

33:27.867 --> 33:30.133
If you don't,
I'll kill you.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.166
Guys, it's me.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.400
I forgot something.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.433
GRAZIANO:
Whoa!

33:35.433 --> 33:37.266
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:43.400 --> 33:46.300
Expected you
a little sooner, babe.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.734
You're a little rusty.

33:50.734 --> 33:52.667
You should've stayed
in New York, Frank.

33:52.667 --> 33:53.900
Any last words?

33:53.900 --> 33:55.900
Yeah.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.633
Why'd you leave me...

33:58.633 --> 33:59.834
for him?

34:07.633 --> 34:09.300
(Eva crying)

34:12.166 --> 34:14.400
Get off of me!

34:14.400 --> 34:15.834
(Eva crying in distance)
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

34:15.834 --> 34:19.166
Baby. We can't go in
guns blazing, right?

34:19.166 --> 34:21.734
(Eva crying)

34:21.734 --> 34:22.900
Got an idea.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.333
It's a little dangerous.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.500
Might even be stupid, but...

34:26.500 --> 34:28.333
Listen, I don't want
to lose momentum,

34:28.333 --> 34:30.900
but I want you to know I am
very proud of you right now.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.734
Come on.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.867
(grunts)

34:35.867 --> 34:38.800
(opera music playing)

34:42.333 --> 34:45.200
First I figured Old Man
Battaglia whacked you

34:45.200 --> 34:48.200
and disposed of your
body to get back at me.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.467
ADRIANA:
Frank, please.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.700
FRANK:
The old man denied it...

34:51.700 --> 34:53.800
until I slit his throat.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.233
Then I realized,

34:55.233 --> 34:58.200
you must've left me.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.233
Let them go.

35:00.233 --> 35:03.400
This is between us, Frank,
not my family.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.834
(elevator bell dings)

35:13.367 --> 35:15.467
Toss the gun.
Leave the cannolis.

35:15.467 --> 35:17.533
These are croissants.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.300
(sighs)

35:20.300 --> 35:21.734
For five miserable years,

35:21.734 --> 35:24.333
I asked myself
what'd I do wrong?

35:26.200 --> 35:28.166
Baby's out of the line of fire.

35:28.166 --> 35:30.467
Adriana and the doctor
are in the main room.

35:30.467 --> 35:32.800
Four gunmen plus Frank.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.166
Listen, you take Frank.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.200
I'll get his backup.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.200
On three, okay?

35:36.200 --> 35:37.500
Okay, on three.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.934
Wait.

35:38.934 --> 35:42.200
You picked him over me!

35:42.200 --> 35:43.300
No!

35:45.200 --> 35:46.667
Can't wait for you, Rog.

35:46.667 --> 35:48.734
Wait. Wait.

35:48.734 --> 35:50.166
One,

35:50.166 --> 35:51.200
two...

35:51.200 --> 35:52.834
(shouts)

35:54.900 --> 35:56.667
Three, three, three!

35:56.667 --> 35:59.734
(opera crescendos)

36:10.633 --> 36:13.100
(Eva crying)

36:19.166 --> 36:21.233
(crying):
It's okay, my baby.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.100
Hey, Riggs.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.166
A little help here?

36:27.166 --> 36:29.233
Oh. Hey, Rog.

36:29.233 --> 36:30.934
(Murtaugh shouting)

36:30.934 --> 36:32.834
(both grunting, groaning)

36:34.900 --> 36:37.200
Aw, things we do for love.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.800
Now get off me. No, yeah.

36:44.266 --> 36:45.600
GRAVES: Frank Truno
is in stable condition,

36:45.600 --> 36:47.900
so he'll be able to stand
trial for kidnapping

36:47.900 --> 36:49.633
and attempted murder.

36:49.633 --> 36:51.867
That is, if you two
will testify.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.266
With complete immunity

36:54.266 --> 36:56.900
and WitSec for everyone.

36:56.900 --> 36:57.867
GRAVES:
Of course,

36:57.867 --> 37:00.500
due to your assault
of a federal officer,

37:00.500 --> 37:03.266
your options for relocation
are now Dismal, Tennessee

37:03.266 --> 37:04.800
and Boring, Oregon.

37:06.200 --> 37:09.533
That is what we in the Bureau
call a joke.

37:09.533 --> 37:12.233
(laughs)
Though they are real towns.

37:12.233 --> 37:14.600
Well, we prefer
somewhere warm.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.200
Adriana is
legitimately bronchial.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.567
Yeah, we can talk about that.

37:20.266 --> 37:22.667
Thank you, Riggs.

37:22.667 --> 37:26.166
You saved my family.

37:26.166 --> 37:27.467
Do me a favor.

37:27.467 --> 37:29.533
Thank my partner.

37:29.533 --> 37:34.200
And, uh, tell him
he's dangerous.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.266
Trapped in an air duct,
mobsters below,

37:37.266 --> 37:39.834
armed to the teeth,
he draws his weapon, he says...

37:39.834 --> 37:42.900
Insert catchphrase
then bang‐bang.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.533
(yawns)
Yawn factory.

37:44.533 --> 37:46.900
You know, I've realized
I think I can move on

37:46.900 --> 37:48.700
from this mob stuff now that
I've kind of lived it.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.233
New idea for a new script.

37:51.233 --> 37:52.500
Oh, can't wait.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.900
Forbidden romance,
young lovers,

37:54.900 --> 37:56.433
uh, their families hate
each other, you know.

37:56.433 --> 37:58.233
It's, uh, <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

37:58.233 --> 37:59.233
but modern.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.900
But what‐what about
the, uh, the set piece?

38:01.900 --> 38:03.567
The‐the character arc?

38:03.567 --> 38:05.400
Oh, you're still
in the picture,

38:05.400 --> 38:07.200
but now I see you
as the villain.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.367
The villain?

38:09.367 --> 38:11.367
The antagonist.

38:11.367 --> 38:12.400
Bald head, flaring nostrils,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.166
declaring, "I stand in
the glorious path of love!"

38:15.166 --> 38:17.367
Oh, it almost
writes itself. Almost.

38:17.367 --> 38:22.200
I don't "stand in the glorious
path of love."

38:24.266 --> 38:26.233
Do I?

38:34.633 --> 38:36.800
(sighs)

38:39.934 --> 38:42.567
You ran a background check
on your friend's date?

38:42.567 --> 38:45.367
(clears throat)
I know.

38:45.367 --> 38:46.900
I promised I would
stay out of it,

38:46.900 --> 38:48.867
but come on, the guy's name
is Chad. (clucks tongue)

38:48.867 --> 38:50.500
Who do you think
she should be dating?

38:50.500 --> 38:52.667
I don't know. Someone great.

38:52.667 --> 38:55.200
You know, like a‐a doctor
or an astronaut

38:55.200 --> 38:56.567
or, ooh, a barbeque pitmaster.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.600
That's kind of good.
Or a cop?

38:58.600 --> 39:01.600
Look, Doc, we're friends.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.166
Okay?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.433
Plus, I'm not some
white‐picket‐fence kind of guy.

39:05.433 --> 39:07.767
You know? And that's what
she deserves.

39:07.767 --> 39:09.900
What about you?

39:09.900 --> 39:11.633
What do you deserve?

39:11.633 --> 39:13.767
(chuckles lightly)

39:21.734 --> 39:24.633
Oh. All‐all the best.

39:24.633 --> 39:26.233
Okay.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.633
Hey.

39:28.633 --> 39:29.900
All good.
Leak fixed.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.233
That was Chad.
Told me his car was towed,

39:32.233 --> 39:33.233
unpaid tickets.

39:33.233 --> 39:34.500
Know anything about this?

39:34.500 --> 39:38.166
Uh, only that unpaid
parking tickets

39:38.166 --> 39:39.867
tends to lead
to, you know,

39:39.867 --> 39:40.700
more serious
criminal behavior.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.467
I was calling him
to cancel our date.

39:43.467 --> 39:44.934
You were right.
He wasn't for me,

39:44.934 --> 39:46.667
but that doesn't mean
you had any right...
Oh, okay.

39:46.667 --> 39:48.433
...to sabotage it.

39:48.433 --> 39:51.367
I don't know what
you're talking about.
No?

39:51.367 --> 39:53.200
No.
Ah.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.400
Like‐like the time you
flattened Kip Cole's tires

39:55.400 --> 39:56.500
in the 10th grade?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.767
I was doing you a favor.

39:58.767 --> 40:00.166
Kip Cole was a loser

40:00.166 --> 40:01.767
and you've always
kind of had a tendency

40:01.767 --> 40:03.767
to be drawn towards
losers, right?

40:03.767 --> 40:06.266
Oh, maybe.
Well, just saying.

40:06.266 --> 40:08.734
And that would explain why
you tried to kiss me that night.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.700
(chuckles) I'm sorry.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.300
Are you referring
to the cheek brush

40:12.300 --> 40:14.300
after the Odessa game?

40:14.300 --> 40:16.333
Need I remind you,
I had a concussion.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.900
So, I was just a little dazed.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.800
Okay? And maybe stumble‐y.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.900
Not my most gracious moment,
but not a kiss.

40:23.900 --> 40:26.533
Right, right.
You were concussed.

40:26.533 --> 40:27.700
That's too bad.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.900
Maybe if you were healthy,
you'd have pulled it off.

Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.

42:05.633 --> 42:07.500

42:40.500 --> 42:43.867
And I dropped out of an air

That's so sweet, baby.

42:45.934 --> 42:48.200

You got a catchphrase, baby?

43:00.467 --> 43:03.467
Actually, before I dropped,
I said,

43:03.467 --> 43:06.800
"I'm too old for this."

43:06.800 --> 43:08.400
Okay, well, you know what,
forget it.
