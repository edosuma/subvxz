02:39.952 --> 02:41.085
Hey, Mom.

02:41.087 --> 02:43.488
Hey! Where did you find
this stranger?

02:43.490 --> 02:44.756
Found him on the road.

02:44.758 --> 02:48.025
Is it okay if I use your car?
I really need to get to work.

02:48.027 --> 02:50.294
- Sure.
- Yeah?

02:50.296 --> 02:53.998
You don't wanna stay and help us finish
off the last of Bambi with this stew?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.735
I'd love to, I have to go.
Dad, thank you.

02:56.737 --> 02:58.104
Have a good one.

03:03.143 --> 03:04.310
How was it?

03:05.245 --> 03:07.113
Yeah, wasn't too bad.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.284
Hey...

03:11.752 --> 03:14.288
you're gonna have to
say a few words tonight.

03:16.724 --> 03:18.025
How many?

03:19.260 --> 03:20.692
Well...

03:20.694 --> 03:24.196
Lincoln did, what,
282 for the Gettysburg Address.

03:24.198 --> 03:25.633
So, 100?

03:30.171 --> 03:32.271
Come on, they're just
trying to thank you.

03:32.273 --> 03:34.141
It's not gonna be
a firing squad.

03:35.376 --> 03:37.111
That would be
over quick, though.

03:55.397 --> 03:56.598
Is that new?

03:57.599 --> 03:58.967
No.

04:00.402 --> 04:02.070
Just tuck it there.

04:25.495 --> 04:27.230
Um...

04:28.631 --> 04:32.132
Um, I'm... I'm no speech giver.

04:32.134 --> 04:37.640
But I sure as heck am very honored to
be named Kehoe's Citizen of the Year.

04:38.207 --> 04:40.711
However, if... if
it were up to me...

04:41.444 --> 04:44.347
I'd give it to
somebody more important.

04:45.381 --> 04:47.448
Uh... I'm a...

04:47.450 --> 04:50.785
I'm just a guy who keeps a strip

04:50.787 --> 04:54.625
of civilization open through
the wilderness for people.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.227
Hmm...

04:57.528 --> 04:58.695
When you...

05:00.731 --> 05:03.365
when you drive the same road
day after day,

05:03.367 --> 05:09.106
it's... easy to start thinking
about the road not taken.

05:11.141 --> 05:14.311
I try not to do that.
You see...

05:15.245 --> 05:16.446
I was lucky.

05:18.181 --> 05:20.552
I picked a good road early...

05:21.619 --> 05:23.586
and I stayed on it.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.704
Hey, kid. How was your day?

06:12.271 --> 06:14.239
Easy!

06:15.874 --> 06:18.241
Kyle. Kyle!

06:18.243 --> 06:19.209
Shut up!

06:19.211 --> 06:21.246
- Help!
- Shut up!

06:26.385 --> 06:27.687
Get his arms!

06:28.253 --> 06:29.887
- Get his belt!
- I got it.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.357
Pull it down.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.630
Help!

06:59.586 --> 07:00.654
Shit.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.790
- What's going on?
- I don't wanna go.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.393
Hey, I know you're smart
but you're not that smart.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.763
Uh, hey.

07:47.035 --> 07:49.671
- Doesn't wanna go.
- Ah, shit.

07:50.806 --> 07:53.675
Let me guess,
this is about Tim, right?

07:54.910 --> 07:56.912
Ryan's got a bully in his class.

07:58.547 --> 08:01.316
Tim rubbed his face
in the dirt yesterday.

08:01.983 --> 08:03.552
Do you know what a bully is?

08:04.619 --> 08:06.720
It's a chance
to prove your mettle.

08:06.722 --> 08:08.889
Now, you don't wanna
waste those chances in life.

08:08.891 --> 08:11.593
- He's a lot bigger than I am.
- Yeah, even better.

08:12.294 --> 08:13.863
Are you saying
I should hit him?

08:14.629 --> 08:16.362
Yeah, for a start.

08:16.364 --> 08:19.234
- That's not a very good idea.
- Oh yeah, why not?

08:20.435 --> 08:22.772
Because then I'll be
as stupid as he is.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.708
Listen... come here, come here.

08:28.010 --> 08:30.478
I gave you <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
for your birthday.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.749
I'll bet you haven't
even started it yet.

08:33.649 --> 08:35.418
Well, then that's too bad.

08:36.552 --> 08:39.255
All the answers you'll ever need
are in that book.

08:39.789 --> 08:41.557
Come on, time to go.

08:52.502 --> 08:54.870
You were a real wild man last night.

08:54.872 --> 08:58.341
- There's no one crazier than you, buddy.
- Who knew you could dance.

09:00.376 --> 09:03.547
- Ah, good times, huh?
- Tell you what, we'll do this again, huh.

09:04.548 --> 09:05.914
Yeah!

09:05.916 --> 09:08.652
You look good.
Get you some breakfast.

10:01.774 --> 10:03.541
Jesus, Grace.

11:13.546 --> 11:14.849
Your son?

11:35.670 --> 11:37.672
He died of a heroin overdose.

11:54.890 --> 11:56.892
Um, excuse me.

11:58.627 --> 12:00.963
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.635
Sorry,
but all the parents say that.

12:08.136 --> 12:10.472
But he... he wasn't a druggie.

12:11.573 --> 12:13.608
What... what are you gonna do?

12:14.010 --> 12:16.878
I'll be turning it
over to Vice and Narcotics.

12:19.215 --> 12:21.583
We didn't know our own son.

12:27.223 --> 12:28.956
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.728
You're not listening!

12:58.956 --> 13:02.292
He leadeth me to the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

13:03.627 --> 13:06.695
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

13:06.697 --> 13:09.666
I shall fear no evil
for thou art with me...

13:17.808 --> 13:19.843
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

13:21.779 --> 13:23.214
My cup runneth over.

13:24.315 --> 13:26.681
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

13:26.683 --> 13:28.284
all the days of my life.

13:28.286 --> 13:31.122
And I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

14:55.976 --> 14:57.377
Hmm?

14:58.111 --> 14:59.146
Nels?

15:00.947 --> 15:02.115
Dante?

15:03.216 --> 15:04.217
Dante?

15:04.784 --> 15:06.220
I'm sorry, Nels.

15:09.223 --> 15:10.757
I'm really sorry.

15:11.259 --> 15:13.127
It wasn't supposed
to end like this.

15:14.362 --> 15:19.167
I know where and when
the cocaine arrives.

15:22.436 --> 15:26.807
Kyle didn't know about any of this.
That's the truth.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.208
It was just one bag.

15:29.210 --> 15:31.045
Just one bag!

15:32.246 --> 15:35.781
But people like that,
they always find out.

15:35.783 --> 15:38.719
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What people?

15:40.489 --> 15:42.224
What people do you mean?

15:42.924 --> 15:43.991
Um...

15:46.894 --> 15:49.931
Do you have...
do you have any cash?

15:50.966 --> 15:53.934
- If they find me, they'll hurt me!
- What people!

15:53.936 --> 15:57.070
- Please! Please!
- What people do you mean?

15:57.072 --> 15:59.005
Speedo,
there's a guy named Speedo.

15:59.007 --> 16:00.807
- Speedo?
- He's the only one I know!

16:00.809 --> 16:02.509
Just tell me
where I can find this guy

16:02.511 --> 16:05.145
and then you get the hell out of here!

16:05.147 --> 16:05.781
Where is he?

17:48.920 --> 17:50.522
So, you're Speedo?

17:51.356 --> 17:53.191
Bingo, gold star.

17:56.529 --> 17:58.397
Dante says hello.

18:01.132 --> 18:02.934
I don't know any Dantes.

18:03.302 --> 18:05.271
Yes, you do.

18:06.905 --> 18:11.077
He worked at the Kehoe airport
with my son... Kyle.

18:12.278 --> 18:13.610
You know him too.

18:18.150 --> 18:19.185
Kyle?

18:21.087 --> 18:23.989
Oh, yeah.
Kyle, that's your kid?

18:24.523 --> 18:28.094
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...
No, I don't know him. Sorry.

18:28.562 --> 18:31.997
I know a lot of people,
I know a lot of... Kyles.

18:32.632 --> 18:34.200
Tell me what happened.

18:42.509 --> 18:44.041
Tell me.

18:44.043 --> 18:46.511
All right, Pops.
There's the door, all right?

18:46.513 --> 18:49.950
I don't know what igloo you crawled out of
but I think it's time you crawled back in.

18:51.318 --> 18:54.488
And trust me,
that's your, uh, best move.

18:58.024 --> 18:59.092
Okay?

19:30.158 --> 19:31.959
You have my phone?

19:36.097 --> 19:38.366
Tell me what happened.

19:49.311 --> 19:50.546
I was...

19:51.447 --> 19:53.413
I was just taking orders.

19:53.415 --> 19:55.016
Taking orders from who?

19:55.417 --> 19:56.452
Who!

19:57.119 --> 19:59.054
- Limbo.
- Huh?

19:59.721 --> 20:01.690
- Limbo.
- Limbo?

20:02.791 --> 20:03.992
Limbo.

20:04.293 --> 20:05.327
Limbo.

20:06.328 --> 20:07.362
Limbo...

20:10.432 --> 20:12.568
Is that him? That Limbo?

21:18.102 --> 21:22.137
<i>No doubt about it, Dan Reeves
was at least in the top three best coaches.</i>

21:22.139 --> 21:25.608
<i>And since we're strolling down
memory lane at the Mile High Stadium,</i>

21:25.610 --> 21:28.277
<i>here's a late night question
for you, Denver.</i>

21:28.279 --> 21:31.346
<i>Greatest quarterback ever,
Elway or Manning?</i>

21:31.348 --> 21:34.684
<i>Give me a call on 555-2395.</i>

21:34.686 --> 21:35.720
Elway.

22:25.906 --> 22:28.174
Aren't you gonna ask
where I've been?

22:39.853 --> 22:41.855
Uh, Speedo's missing.

22:54.368 --> 22:56.136
Who's Speedo?

22:56.603 --> 22:59.471
One of my employees.
But you wouldn't know about him,

22:59.473 --> 23:03.443
because we don't talk about business
on the way to school, do we?

23:13.688 --> 23:15.123
Who packed these?

23:17.859 --> 23:20.926
- Didn't think a treat would kill him.
- High fructose corn syrup.

23:20.928 --> 23:22.363
Lecithin.

23:22.997 --> 23:24.432
Baking soda?

23:26.401 --> 23:28.636
The only thing not in those
is rat poison.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.508
I want you to know...

23:34.642 --> 23:36.344
I had no hand in this.

23:44.652 --> 23:46.621
I say make them all legal.

23:47.355 --> 23:48.891
Meth, ex, opium.

23:50.759 --> 23:53.796
An opium den in every mall,
that's my platform.

23:55.864 --> 24:00.836
Give the people what they want. Tax the
shit out of it, then double our pay.

24:02.871 --> 24:05.605
- What do you think about that?
- No thanks.

24:05.607 --> 24:10.410
I wanna be able to tell the good guys from the
bad guys. That way I'll know who to shoot.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.251
Nels Coxman.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.587
Citizen of the Year.

24:19.688 --> 24:21.191
Good for him.

24:24.761 --> 24:27.329
It's a real word, you know,
cocksman.

24:27.664 --> 24:31.331
It means "a man adept
at the art of fornication."

24:31.333 --> 24:32.368
Nice.

24:36.539 --> 24:37.538
You see these guys?

24:42.779 --> 24:44.946
Whoa. Whoa, hey...

24:44.948 --> 24:46.916
It's just weed.

24:48.052 --> 24:50.651
Yeah, it's legal to purchase,
legal to smoke at home.

24:50.653 --> 24:52.821
Take a breath.
Come on, breathe.

24:52.823 --> 24:55.323
There's a principle
you need to get on board with

24:55.325 --> 24:59.427
if you intend to survive and
advance in Kehoe law enforcement.

24:59.429 --> 25:01.597
It's called community policing.

25:01.599 --> 25:06.535
Wherein we embrace and enforce
the values of our community.

25:06.537 --> 25:08.737
The values of them
giving us the finger?

25:08.739 --> 25:13.709
We're a ski town. Folks come here to
ski, have sex and get high.

25:13.711 --> 25:15.577
So lighten up.

25:15.579 --> 25:17.515
Here, you wanna get your Dirty Harry on?

25:21.485 --> 25:22.954
The meter just hit zero.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.589
Get rid of the gum.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.650
So, what can I do for you, boss?

26:26.652 --> 26:28.419
Uh, I'm...

26:28.421 --> 26:30.588
I'll be right with you.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.692
- Just can't believe this is happening.
- Give me one second.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.897
What's the verdict back here?

26:40.067 --> 26:40.968
Wow.

26:41.802 --> 26:43.804
It's absolutely stunning.

26:44.171 --> 26:47.205
Hmm. Yeah,
I can't believe this.

26:47.207 --> 26:50.077
I love the detail
in the lace. The shape.

26:50.544 --> 26:52.510
- It's so elegant, right?
- Yes.

26:52.512 --> 26:55.415
No, I absolutely
love it. I think this is it.

26:58.886 --> 27:01.152
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- It's so stupid.

27:01.154 --> 27:02.654
You look absolutely...

27:02.656 --> 27:05.457
I'll throw in the veil
at no extra charge.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.026
Wow!

27:07.028 --> 27:09.063
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for everything.

27:09.663 --> 27:11.065
It feels surreal.

27:14.002 --> 27:16.037
All right.
How can I help you, boss?

27:17.138 --> 27:21.809
Uh, I'm, uh,
I'm looking for a tux.

27:23.578 --> 27:26.047
You got it. When is the wedding?

27:29.050 --> 27:31.519
It's not a wedding. My...

27:32.120 --> 27:35.890
my wife and I,
we're renewing our vows.

27:39.127 --> 27:40.795
Still going strong, huh?

27:42.964 --> 27:44.532
That's what I like to hear.

27:45.767 --> 27:48.536
- How's about we get you measured, huh?
- Sure.

27:56.779 --> 27:58.679
You killed my boy.

27:58.681 --> 28:00.950
Who told you to do it?

28:06.255 --> 28:07.287
Who?

28:07.289 --> 28:09.089
Santa. Santa.

28:09.091 --> 28:11.124
- "Santa"?
- That's what he goes by.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.465
Where can I find this "Santa"?

28:21.603 --> 28:23.870
There's a little airport
in Kehoe.

28:23.872 --> 28:26.040
He flies in with the coke
and out with the money.

28:26.042 --> 28:27.509
What does he look like?

28:28.078 --> 28:29.746
He looks like a Santa.

28:31.114 --> 28:35.149
No! Come on, please. You don't
have to do that. Come on, please.

28:43.927 --> 28:45.228
Elway or Manning?

28:49.666 --> 28:50.767
What?

28:51.268 --> 28:54.804
Greatest quarterback ever.
Elway or Manning?

29:01.012 --> 29:02.013
Elway.

29:44.890 --> 29:47.559
Did you know Kyle
had a Facebook?

29:52.030 --> 29:53.665
Do you know his favorite band?

29:57.903 --> 30:00.639
He posted his favorite movies,
do you know those?

30:04.943 --> 30:07.980
What'd the two of you talk about
on your damn hunting trips?

30:13.219 --> 30:14.220
Hunting.

30:27.900 --> 30:28.935
Damn it.

30:29.268 --> 30:30.303
Goddamn.

30:38.245 --> 30:39.213
Damn it!

30:43.283 --> 30:45.083
That's the fourth gym bag
you've lost.

30:45.085 --> 30:46.619
Yeah,
but who's counting, right?

30:49.223 --> 30:51.223
You might find this
hard to believe

30:51.225 --> 30:53.892
but I've got more important things
to do than keep track of gym bags.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.630
Like earning the money
to pay for them.

30:57.097 --> 30:58.165
Tell you what...

30:58.432 --> 31:00.298
why don't you take this

31:00.300 --> 31:04.169
and buy him every single
goddamn gym bag he'll ever need.

31:04.171 --> 31:05.373
Does that work for you?

31:09.377 --> 31:10.677
All right.

31:11.178 --> 31:12.679
Well, that's for you.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.216
- Tell me this is a joke.
- No.

31:17.218 --> 31:19.220
That's Ryan's new diet.
And you're gonna follow it to the letter.

31:19.487 --> 31:22.488
Breakfast: grass-fed beef,
asparagus, cashews.

31:22.490 --> 31:24.991
Lunch, the same.
Dinner, the same.

31:24.993 --> 31:28.227
Yeah, that's on Mondays. Tuesday it
rotates. Chicken, broccoli and almonds.

31:28.229 --> 31:29.864
For breakfast, lunch and dinner?

31:31.332 --> 31:33.900
You want our son to eat the
same thing three times a day?

31:33.902 --> 31:36.969
Eighty percent of our immune
system starts in the gut.

31:36.971 --> 31:39.872
Keep it simple in the gut,
you get to live a long life.

31:39.874 --> 31:42.277
A week on this diet
and he'll wanna kill himself.

31:42.911 --> 31:44.278
And I'll help him do it.

31:44.280 --> 31:46.147
You know what,
you should be grateful.

31:47.715 --> 31:51.218
My dad started my day with half a
grapefruit and three lines of primo coke.

31:51.220 --> 31:53.253
"Breakfast of champions,"
he called it.

31:53.255 --> 31:56.691
And now your son can't look at a
candy bar without breaking into hives.

31:57.326 --> 31:59.794
Congratulations,
you've broken the cycle.

32:00.863 --> 32:01.931
And to think...

32:05.935 --> 32:08.270
I used to love the mouth on you.

32:09.338 --> 32:10.973
I've spoken to my lawyer.

32:11.941 --> 32:14.877
We want a new arrangement.
Ten days with me, four with you.

32:16.178 --> 32:17.146
Huh.

32:18.448 --> 32:22.483
Here's my counter offer.
Fourteen days with me and none with you.

32:22.485 --> 32:24.753
Let's see what your lawyer
thinks about that.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.760
- Morning, Aya.
- Hey, Mustang.

32:39.336 --> 32:41.037
They say Limbo's disappeared.

32:55.885 --> 32:57.887
Don't worry about it,
he'll get over it.

33:01.425 --> 33:02.792
Is that Mozart?

33:04.095 --> 33:07.965
Bach. You can always tell Bach
because he's really mathematical.

33:09.166 --> 33:11.500
- Is he the one with all the kids?
- Yeah, 20.

33:15.239 --> 33:17.375
It's a wonder he found
any time to compose.

33:18.209 --> 33:20.344
I need your help
with my fantasy football.

33:21.145 --> 33:23.180
I can't... I can't win a game.

33:27.018 --> 33:28.119
Playing for money?

33:30.121 --> 33:32.324
Yeah, of course
I'm playing for money.

33:35.026 --> 33:37.462
You got four Cleveland Browns
on your team.

33:38.397 --> 33:39.897
Well, they're my home team.

33:41.033 --> 33:42.467
What's a man without loyalty?

33:45.437 --> 33:47.005
I can't help you.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.577
Hey, there's not enough
room to pass,

35:31.579 --> 35:34.916
I was wondering if you'd
back down to the turnoff?

35:42.090 --> 35:43.958
Any chance you could back up?

35:47.362 --> 35:50.365
Um, just between you and me,
right?

35:51.099 --> 35:52.435
Me, you and frosty.

35:54.035 --> 35:55.036
Sure.

36:04.346 --> 36:08.482
You have no clue
who you're messing with, man.

36:08.484 --> 36:09.952
Who am I messing with?

36:12.021 --> 36:14.123
You're dust, pal.

36:22.431 --> 36:23.464
Tell me.

36:25.702 --> 36:28.337
You're wasting your time.

36:42.118 --> 36:45.322
Are you tired, old man?

36:49.092 --> 36:50.093
Yeah.

38:02.301 --> 38:03.435
Grace?

38:05.638 --> 38:06.839
Grace?

39:27.355 --> 39:28.757
What are you doing here?

39:30.659 --> 39:31.726
Kyle's dead.

39:33.728 --> 39:34.929
Somebody killed him.

39:36.297 --> 39:37.799
What's that got to do with me?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.368
Can I come in?

39:48.778 --> 39:52.580
Better take your shoes off. She'll
skin you alive.

39:53.581 --> 39:55.548
I'm going to make
some phone calls.

39:55.550 --> 39:57.252
Find out what happened to Kyle.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.990
She thinks you're one
of the guys from the old days.

40:34.524 --> 40:35.592
Don't worry about her.

40:36.927 --> 40:41.398
Kyle. He got mixed up with some
clown by the name of Dante.

40:41.698 --> 40:44.466
And they stole
a kilo of coke from Viking.

40:44.468 --> 40:47.370
- Who's Viking?
- Drug dealer. A big one.

40:47.804 --> 40:51.374
- You know him?
- Yeah, when he was a snot-nosed kid.

40:51.842 --> 40:55.510
- I knew his old man, Bullitt.
- Dad knew him, too?

40:55.512 --> 40:59.951
Whenever Bullitt had rough stuff to be done,
that was his go-to guy. After Dad, me.

41:00.650 --> 41:02.419
And then Viking took over.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.987
Viking's a whole
different breed.

41:04.989 --> 41:06.691
He likes hurting people.

41:09.093 --> 41:10.795
I'm gonna kill him, Brock.

41:13.831 --> 41:14.966
Sure you are.

41:16.634 --> 41:18.636
What makes you think
you can kill a man?

41:22.974 --> 41:23.975
I've...

41:24.809 --> 41:26.911
I've killed three of his guys.

41:28.513 --> 41:30.314
What did you do with the bodies?

41:30.782 --> 41:33.751
Wrapped them in chicken wire,
threw them on the gorge.

41:35.821 --> 41:38.755
- Chicken wire?
- Yeah, to let the fish get at them.

41:38.757 --> 41:41.357
They'll eat the flesh
off the bones.

41:41.359 --> 41:43.627
So the bodies don't fill
with gas and rise.

41:43.629 --> 41:45.564
They stay at the bottom.

41:47.466 --> 41:51.003
- Where did you learn that?
- I read it in a crime novel.

42:04.683 --> 42:07.452
- He is my brother.
- Brother?

42:08.121 --> 42:09.454
My ass.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.396
I know.

42:24.704 --> 42:26.472
- Maybe I should...
- Shut up.

42:33.012 --> 42:34.480
You stay out of trouble.

42:38.418 --> 42:40.420
The things we do for love, huh?

42:41.055 --> 42:43.654
She was skimming the till
at a massage parlor.

42:43.656 --> 42:45.993
They sent me to beat the shit
out of her. Instead...

42:46.994 --> 42:48.095
How's Grace?

42:49.997 --> 42:51.497
She left.

42:52.432 --> 42:54.733
The lady's got good timing,
I'll give her that.

42:54.735 --> 42:56.436
How do I find this Viking?

42:57.437 --> 42:58.404
You don't.

42:59.807 --> 43:03.677
- You've gone as far up the ladder as you're gonna go.
- We'll see.

43:05.145 --> 43:08.580
One guy can disappear.
Two? I don't think so.

43:08.582 --> 43:11.619
Three? With ten keys of coke?

43:12.220 --> 43:14.388
Maybe they were
all in it together.

43:21.897 --> 43:24.733
You think three of my dealers
ran out on me?

43:25.666 --> 43:29.570
That would make me the worst judge of
character in the Rockies, that's your theory?

43:32.540 --> 43:33.708
- No.
- No.

43:37.979 --> 43:40.914
It was those goddamn Indians.

43:40.916 --> 43:43.549
This is all my father's fault
for getting into bed with them.

43:43.551 --> 43:45.051
I'm sorry, the Indians?

43:45.053 --> 43:47.053
When Viking's father
was first getting started,

43:47.055 --> 43:49.622
he made a deal with an
Indian named White Bull.

43:49.624 --> 43:51.925
He supplied him,
White Bull dealt on the reservation.

43:51.927 --> 43:54.194
Until White Bull
wanted more turf.

43:54.196 --> 43:57.965
- So he tossed White Bull a few piece of crap towns.
- Like Kehoe.

43:57.967 --> 44:01.636
And Kehoe builds a ski resort.
Turns it into a gold mine.

44:02.071 --> 44:05.005
What's the one thing
history's taught us?

44:05.007 --> 44:08.110
You keep those Indians
on the reservation.

44:09.111 --> 44:12.579
Those Indians,
they're always wanting more.

44:12.581 --> 44:14.951
Because they think the turf
was theirs all along.

44:15.217 --> 44:17.119
Might kinda have
a point there, right.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.037
White Bull gave this
to my father...

44:34.905 --> 44:36.974
the day they shook
on their deal.

44:38.709 --> 44:39.810
Yeah.

44:41.211 --> 44:43.246
It's time we give it
back to him.

44:50.587 --> 44:54.689
- What can I do for you two?
- You could sit down with us. Tell us your story.

44:54.691 --> 44:59.163
- I got other customers.
- Yeah, that's funny. All I can see in here is you.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.798
Please tell me you work nights.

45:02.266 --> 45:04.200
Thursdays. Why?

45:04.202 --> 45:07.069
You look this good in sunlight,
I gotta see you after dark.

45:07.071 --> 45:10.141
Eggs, bacon, pancakes.

45:10.674 --> 45:11.776
And for you?

45:12.210 --> 45:14.979
Surprise me.

45:15.947 --> 45:16.981
Okay.

45:18.282 --> 45:21.751
I was 13 when my dad kicked it.
You know his last words to me?

45:21.753 --> 45:24.555
"Try to bang every waitress
who ever serves you."

45:30.229 --> 45:33.831
This Indian is
taking forever to show up.

45:38.636 --> 45:41.839
So, tell me
about this motel trick of yours.

45:42.274 --> 45:43.574
Twenty bucks.

45:46.011 --> 45:47.913
It's not a trick, all right.

45:49.515 --> 45:52.082
It's a beautiful invention. It's an invention
Steve Jobs would have been proud of.

45:52.084 --> 45:53.917
- Steve Jobs, huh?
- That's right.

45:53.919 --> 45:57.020
You know what made that guy
such a genius? Simplicity.

45:57.022 --> 45:58.791
- Let's hear it already.
- All right.

45:59.691 --> 46:02.926
I stay in motels
100 nights a year, right.

46:02.928 --> 46:06.863
First thing, every morning, I hang a
"clean the room" sign on the doorknob.

46:06.865 --> 46:09.066
Maid sees the sign,
she opens the door.

46:09.068 --> 46:11.735
Now, pay attention
to the details here.

46:11.737 --> 46:13.672
All the hard thought
behind them.

46:14.140 --> 46:18.111
I'm lying on top of the covers,
stone naked.

46:19.112 --> 46:22.380
First crucial part,
I look into the maid's eyes, all right?

46:22.382 --> 46:26.853
If I don't, she backs right outta that
door. It's over before it even starts.

46:27.720 --> 46:31.155
I take the twenty,
I lay it right on my Jimmy.

46:31.157 --> 46:33.257
- Boom.
- Just a twenty?

46:33.259 --> 46:36.794
Maids make $8.35 an hour,
and they've got miserable lives too.

46:36.796 --> 46:38.830
That's the totally
underrated part of this.

46:38.832 --> 46:40.399
The ball is completely
in her court.

46:40.401 --> 46:42.434
She could back out of that door
no harm, no foul.

46:42.436 --> 46:45.703
Or... she could come and get it.

46:47.874 --> 46:50.976
- What's your success rate?
- Thirty-one percent.

46:50.978 --> 46:53.214
Hundred motels a year,
you do the math.

46:54.781 --> 46:57.783
He's got the same little
yellow gloves White Bull wears.

46:57.785 --> 46:59.952
- Is that an Indian thing?
- I guess.

47:05.860 --> 47:08.028
It's good.

47:08.829 --> 47:11.232
That's Steve fucking Jobs good.

47:12.032 --> 47:15.200
I see one flaw. Quality control.

47:15.202 --> 47:17.872
I'm paying her 20 bucks,
I'm not asking for Miss America.

47:18.406 --> 47:23.376
Still, there's no way there's 31 maids
in the whole country worth banging.

47:23.378 --> 47:25.347
You'd be surprised.

47:31.353 --> 47:33.155
Oh dear.

47:35.824 --> 47:38.091
Been at it all night,
haven't gotten a thing out of him.

47:40.862 --> 47:42.063
And you won't.

47:47.302 --> 47:48.371
You know, pain...

47:51.806 --> 47:54.040
it's like a religion
to these guys.

47:54.042 --> 47:56.976
You know, the Apaches used to consider
getting tortured a mark of honor.

47:56.978 --> 47:58.445
How's that for a value system?

47:58.447 --> 47:59.748
He's a Ute.

48:00.749 --> 48:04.051
- What now?
- Local Indians are Utes. Not Apache.

48:04.053 --> 48:06.923
You know I married an Indian.
Don't you think I know the difference?

48:57.841 --> 48:59.810
This doesn't happen
in Kehoe.

49:02.313 --> 49:03.914
It just did.

49:31.142 --> 49:32.910
It was his first run.

49:36.482 --> 49:39.183
"Just one run, Papa,"
he says to me.

49:42.288 --> 49:43.522
"I can do it."

49:46.125 --> 49:47.159
"I'm your son."

49:47.393 --> 49:48.926
What are we going to do?

50:05.578 --> 50:07.547
Okay, let's go home to Denver.

50:43.617 --> 50:45.118
Mr. Coxman.

50:57.264 --> 50:59.233
I'm very sorry for your loss.

51:02.636 --> 51:03.870
Thanks.

51:09.310 --> 51:10.344
Hey.

51:11.379 --> 51:12.413
So...

51:13.147 --> 51:14.548
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

51:15.950 --> 51:19.051
Ex-boyfriend of mine works Vice in Denver.
So I gave him a call today.

51:19.053 --> 51:22.187
Because you missed him and
wanted to see how he was doing.

51:22.189 --> 51:24.990
Well, he still thinks
there's a chance for us.

51:24.992 --> 51:26.026
What's his name?

51:27.496 --> 51:28.530
Kurt.

51:30.565 --> 51:34.302
- How long were you two lovers?
- Oh, Jesus. Two months, okay.

51:35.970 --> 51:42.344
I had him look up the forensics on our sign
hanger. The guy's name is Simon LeGrew.

51:42.577 --> 51:45.011
Now, his father is White Bull.

51:45.013 --> 51:47.547
He's a Native American
drug dealer from Denver

51:47.549 --> 51:50.350
who's been dealing coke
around here for 30 years.

51:50.352 --> 51:54.020
So now, White Bull
shares territory with Viking.

51:54.022 --> 51:57.993
He's a Denver drug dealer whose
real name is Trevor Calcote.

51:58.361 --> 51:59.395
So...

51:59.995 --> 52:01.462
I'm thinking...

52:01.464 --> 52:03.599
what we have here is a turf war.

52:04.534 --> 52:06.134
A drug turf war.

52:07.068 --> 52:08.471
Right here in Kehoe.

52:10.740 --> 52:12.508
So what are we gonna
do about it?

52:17.313 --> 52:23.017
Well, my 30 years' experience tells
me that this is a job for Denver Vice.

52:23.019 --> 52:27.455
It doesn't bother you that I just
learned more about a local drug lord

52:27.457 --> 52:30.492
in five minutes on the phone
than you've learned in 30 years?

52:30.494 --> 52:36.032
What bothers me is that Kurt's lying in bed
tonight convinced that he's back in your heart.

52:41.438 --> 52:43.072
Kurt's a big boy.

52:43.774 --> 52:45.576
I knew you'd be back.

52:48.078 --> 52:51.246
All right, Viking's real name
is Trevor Calcote.

52:51.248 --> 52:53.748
If you want him dead,
you're gonna have to hire a hit man.

52:53.750 --> 52:56.520
- A hit man?
- Yeah. An assassin.

52:58.222 --> 52:59.389
Do you know one?

53:00.190 --> 53:01.492
The Eskimo.

53:04.328 --> 53:06.163
So, how does this work?

53:06.464 --> 53:10.433
You buy The Eskimo a train ticket.
He's afraid to fly.

53:10.435 --> 53:13.769
You pick him up at the train
station, you drive him to a motel

53:13.771 --> 53:15.738
where you give him
half the money upfront.

53:15.740 --> 53:17.275
And then you go home.

53:18.643 --> 53:22.144
- How do I know when it's done?
- Keep checking <i>The Denver Post.</i>

53:22.146 --> 53:24.182
They can't resist
a good rub out.

53:25.416 --> 53:29.087
What is it with all these nicknames?
Speedo, Viking, Eskimo.

53:30.321 --> 53:32.823
The Eskimo.
It's a gangster thing.

53:32.825 --> 53:34.092
Did you have a nickname?

53:37.161 --> 53:39.297
Yeah. Wingman.

53:40.599 --> 53:41.667
Wingman?

53:42.868 --> 53:46.204
Yeah, from <i>Top Gun.</i>
As in "you can be my Wingman."

53:49.675 --> 53:50.776
Wingman.

54:10.529 --> 54:11.798
Come on.

54:16.402 --> 54:17.637
I tried, buddy.

55:12.860 --> 55:14.760
Some real music, please.

55:16.932 --> 55:19.901
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything else. Just no Kanye.

55:27.776 --> 55:29.377
Take it out of his tip.

55:41.523 --> 55:45.193
There's a convention in town.
This is all I could get.

56:05.882 --> 56:08.551
- This is only half.
- That's right.

56:10.887 --> 56:12.187
Are you a cop?

56:12.722 --> 56:13.656
No.

56:22.432 --> 56:25.800
The reason I ask is cops are
always a year behind the street.

56:25.802 --> 56:29.907
But the street knows it's two-thirds
upfront, one-third when the deal is done.

56:30.406 --> 56:33.643
But cops... they still think
it's half and half.

56:40.450 --> 56:42.786
Okay. We can do two-thirds.

56:51.395 --> 56:53.464
We're gonna get along
just fine.

56:55.399 --> 56:56.498
Yes!

56:56.500 --> 56:59.668
Yes! Ten grand! Ten grand, baby!

56:59.670 --> 57:00.671
Ten grand!

57:02.173 --> 57:06.543
That Jet touchdown just beat your Browns.
Whatever happened to loyalty?

57:10.347 --> 57:12.650
Sometimes loyalty
comes at a price.

57:14.018 --> 57:16.451
And besides,
my grandmother's from Brooklyn.

57:16.453 --> 57:18.623
So? Why don't you
give her a cut?

57:24.662 --> 57:25.563
Yeah?

57:26.865 --> 57:30.502
Says he's The Eskimo.
Says he has information you wanna buy.

57:31.436 --> 57:32.504
Let's hear him out.

57:38.710 --> 57:41.677
I've been offered
ninety grand to ice you.

57:41.679 --> 57:42.948
To ice me?

57:43.949 --> 57:47.485
You wanna ice a guy, you go to The Eskimo.
Well, that works for me.

57:48.419 --> 57:50.486
Who knew White Bull
had that kind of coin?

57:50.488 --> 57:53.624
White Bull's an Indian.
Indians don't farm out their kills.

57:53.626 --> 57:57.361
- So, if it wasn't White Bull, then who the hell was it?
- That's what I'm selling.

57:57.363 --> 58:00.366
- Well, how much?
- Ninety grand.

58:02.067 --> 58:04.067
You gotta love
the symmetry, there.

58:04.069 --> 58:06.904
You are one hell
of a businessman.

58:06.906 --> 58:08.041
I tries.

58:09.775 --> 58:12.478
Try. It's a singular.

58:14.413 --> 58:16.917
- Do we have a deal?
- 'Course we got a deal.

58:19.820 --> 58:22.654
Deposit the money into
this Cayman Islands account.

58:22.656 --> 58:25.123
When it hits, you get the name.

58:25.125 --> 58:26.358
Goody.

58:36.970 --> 58:39.103
I like working with pros.

58:39.105 --> 58:41.140
Cuts way down
on the bullshit factor.

58:41.142 --> 58:43.009
Yeah. So...

58:45.812 --> 58:47.712
who wants me dead?

58:47.714 --> 58:49.516
Guy's name is Coxman.

58:50.517 --> 58:51.618
Coxman.

58:52.519 --> 58:55.120
There was a Coxman
on Dad's payroll, right?

58:55.122 --> 58:59.026
What was his name? He called
himself, uh, Wing... Ding...

58:59.526 --> 59:01.093
Ringworm... Wing... Ding...

59:01.095 --> 59:02.928
- Wingman.
- Wingman!

59:02.930 --> 59:03.996
Wingman!

59:03.998 --> 59:07.034
Wingman wants me dead? Why?

59:07.602 --> 59:10.471
The why of it ain't my
business so I don't aks.

59:12.740 --> 59:15.208
- Ask.
- I think our business here is done.

59:15.210 --> 59:16.878
So it is.

59:17.511 --> 59:21.116
Hey, can I ask two questions?
If I may.

59:21.849 --> 59:23.517
One pro to another.

59:27.521 --> 59:28.489
Shoot.

59:32.593 --> 59:34.863
Why do they call you The Eskimo?

59:35.463 --> 59:37.831
Comes from the brothers
in the hood.

59:37.833 --> 59:41.837
Any nigga crazy enough to move up to snow
country has gotta be a fucking Eskimo.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.207
That's... you're funny.

59:47.209 --> 59:50.445
- Second question.
- All right, it's...

59:52.781 --> 59:55.015
Who taught you your ethics?

59:55.017 --> 59:57.084
Come again?

59:57.086 --> 01:00:01.456
You made a deal to kill me for 90
grand and you didn't honor that deal.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.061
It's because
I'm honoring this one.

01:00:08.164 --> 01:00:09.165
Yeah.

01:00:10.967 --> 01:00:15.171
Guess a man's word doesn't
matter in the hood, right?

01:00:16.205 --> 01:00:19.807
Guess it's just every man
for himself in there.

01:00:19.809 --> 01:00:22.843
You see, out here,
character counts.

01:00:22.845 --> 01:00:25.848
Without character there can be
no business and...

01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:28.017
without business...

01:00:29.052 --> 01:00:30.087
well...

01:00:31.955 --> 01:00:33.991
what the hell
would we do all day?

01:00:51.608 --> 01:00:53.610
Would you mind
stepping off the rug?

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.757
Is this what you call
an Eskimo Roll?

01:01:19.938 --> 01:01:22.273
I'm thinking Ireland.

01:01:23.742 --> 01:01:25.076
Maybe Germany.

01:01:25.944 --> 01:01:27.212
Yeah? For what?

01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:31.216
- My ten grand vacation.
- Oh.

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:35.920
Yeah, well,
Guinness over Becks any day.

01:01:42.294 --> 01:01:43.996
Then Dublin it is.

01:01:45.897 --> 01:01:47.732
You're gonna take me to Dublin?

01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:49.268
Yeah.

01:01:52.271 --> 01:01:53.305
Hey.

01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.247
Mustang, if we get caught out.

01:03:02.944 --> 01:03:03.945
Wingman.

01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:05.947
How the hell you been?

01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:15.623
We'd like you to come
for a little ride.

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:39.680
Okay, Wingman,
tell me about The Eskimo.

01:03:39.948 --> 01:03:42.949
I guess you just don't get
what you pay for anymore.

01:03:42.951 --> 01:03:45.154
- Some of us do.
- Oh yeah?

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:48.855
Well, what about Speedo
and Limbo and Santa?

01:03:48.857 --> 01:03:51.091
How did those guys
work out for you, huh?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:56.163
Okay. Now before you die, you're
gonna tell me what this is all about.

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:59.367
The only question is,
how much pain do you wanna endure?

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:04.407
I got cancer of the ass, dickweed.
So screw you, and screw your pain.

01:04:04.973 --> 01:04:06.975
You wanna know
what this is all about?

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.944
- It's about Bullitt.
- My father?

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.280
Lying piece of shit
stole my woman.

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:14.348
Dad banged anything
with a hole.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.051
Hey Bone, what is it
you used to say about him?

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.320
He'd bang a rattlesnake
if someone held its head.

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.324
- No offense.
- No, none taken.

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:25.359
- Dad had thousands of women.
- Yeah, well, one of them was mine.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:30.131
- What's that got to do with me?
- His rancid blood runs through your veins.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:35.239
And that stupid grin of his is
plastered all over your arrogant face.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:39.842
Where's my cocaine?

01:04:42.513 --> 01:04:44.381
I flushed it down the toilet.

01:04:44.949 --> 01:04:47.318
- That was ten kilos.
- At least.

01:04:47.952 --> 01:04:50.219
Honestly, I thought it was more.

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:52.823
So, you kill my men,

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:57.795
you steal my coke,
over a goddamn woman?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:02.366
It's called love, sweetheart.
You should try it sometime.

01:05:03.435 --> 01:05:05.370
Now, are we done?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.906
Or do you want
to keep on chatting, skippy?

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.108
Nah.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.346
Okay, Wingman.

01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:18.581
See, that's
how you do it, fellas.

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:20.984
That's how you go out strong.

01:05:57.023 --> 01:05:58.291
Kehoe Precinct.

01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:00.991
- Yeah, just a sec. Kim.
- Yeah?

01:06:00.993 --> 01:06:02.895
Denver Vice.

01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:07.033
Kurt, hi.

01:06:08.901 --> 01:06:12.936
<i>So, that deep dive into Viking
and White Bull that you asked for...</i>

01:06:12.938 --> 01:06:14.439
<i>I got all the files here.</i>

01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:16.340
You're the best.

01:06:16.342 --> 01:06:17.509
<i>Wasn't easy.</i>

01:06:17.511 --> 01:06:19.979
Thank you.
Can you email them over?

01:06:20.212 --> 01:06:24.114
<i>I could. Or I could drive them up and
put them right into your warm hands.</i>

01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:28.018
<i>'Course, it's a three-hour drive,
so I need a place to stay the night.</i>

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.557
Well, there's always my place.
But, here's the thing.

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:36.296
I really need to spend
all night with those files.

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:39.631
Now, if you were to shoot them
right over to me,

01:06:39.633 --> 01:06:42.200
I could probably be done
with them by tonight.

01:06:42.202 --> 01:06:47.040
And then I could put all my pent
up energy into something else.

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:52.378
<i>Hmm. Okay, well, you got them, baby. Bang.</i>

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.847
<i>Right in your inbox.</i>

01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:55.548
Oh, they're right in there.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:58.284
<i>So, how do we wanna do this?</i>

01:06:58.286 --> 01:07:01.287
<i>I'm thinking you leave the
door open and your lights off.</i>

01:07:01.289 --> 01:07:03.255
<i>Trust me to find...</i>

01:07:04.425 --> 01:07:06.592
Hold on a second. What was that?

01:07:06.594 --> 01:07:09.161
- <i>I said...</i>
- Oh God, we got an avalanche.

01:07:09.163 --> 01:07:10.598
I gotta call you back.

01:07:17.071 --> 01:07:18.573
Oh, hey, Gip?

01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:20.609
Yes!

01:07:33.489 --> 01:07:35.657
<i>Do I look like
a homeless guy to you?</i>

01:07:38.227 --> 01:07:39.628
<i>Thirty years ago...</i>

01:07:41.163 --> 01:07:45.134
<i>I lived in a hole in the ground below
the house of the guy that dealt me drugs.</i>

01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:50.939
<i>One day, he came to me,
stuck out his hand.</i>

01:07:54.176 --> 01:07:55.277
<i>I took it.</i>

01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:58.548
<i>And we made a deal.</i>

01:08:01.183 --> 01:08:02.485
<i>It was a good deal.</i>

01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:06.121
<i>Not a great deal.</i>

01:08:08.725 --> 01:08:11.361
<i>I should have bought a casino
like my brother.</i>

01:08:15.298 --> 01:08:16.666
<i>But a deal is a deal.</i>

01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:19.335
<i>And I honored it.</i>

01:08:21.438 --> 01:08:22.471
That honor...

01:08:23.573 --> 01:08:25.442
was repaid with butchery.

01:08:28.111 --> 01:08:29.645
They took my only son.

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:34.517
Today...

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:38.988
my boy will make
his final journey home.

01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:42.693
We will stay.

01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:45.595
Take our revenge.

01:08:47.398 --> 01:08:49.700
I will have blood for blood.

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:53.703
A son for a son.

01:09:42.153 --> 01:09:42.854
Hi.

01:09:44.724 --> 01:09:46.756
- Goddamn it.
- You forgot.

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:47.792
What?

01:09:48.694 --> 01:09:51.094
- What?
- The bullying seminar.

01:09:51.095 --> 01:09:53.531
Oh, God.

01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:55.434
- Every other parent was there.
- You're right, I forgot about the bullying seminar.

01:09:55.801 --> 01:09:57.668
But I'm allowed to forget,
you know why?

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:00.204
Because I wrote a check
for a new computer center.

01:10:00.206 --> 01:10:04.110
You write a check, you get to skip on
150 bullying seminars. That's the math.

01:10:04.677 --> 01:10:07.113
That's one of the perks
of my business.

01:10:07.513 --> 01:10:10.416
You're not a businessman,
Trevor. You're a criminal.

01:10:12.552 --> 01:10:16.120
My powder's not good enough for you anymore?
I remember when it was plenty good enough.

01:10:16.122 --> 01:10:17.791
When you used
to roll around in it.

01:10:21.327 --> 01:10:22.361
Ah.

01:10:23.462 --> 01:10:27.668
See, I remember when just
a little bit of my powder...

01:10:30.504 --> 01:10:33.206
made you buck like a bronco.

01:10:35.309 --> 01:10:36.376
Goddamn.

01:10:38.478 --> 01:10:41.748
Close those beautiful
brown eyes of yours.

01:10:46.653 --> 01:10:50.123
See if it all
comes back to you.

01:10:50.324 --> 01:10:53.861
They needed a host for next week's
fundraiser. I signed you up.

01:12:08.303 --> 01:12:10.470
Here.

01:12:10.472 --> 01:12:12.374
Three of Viking's drug dealers
have disappeared in the last week.

01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:15.210
Tell me who Viking is again?

01:12:16.379 --> 01:12:19.282
The Denver drug lord.
White Bull's rival.

01:12:20.784 --> 01:12:22.385
Let me ask you a question.

01:12:22.952 --> 01:12:26.454
What is it you think we might
do to Viking or to White Bull?

01:12:26.456 --> 01:12:28.825
Take them out. Save our town.

01:12:32.729 --> 01:12:34.865
We got a little problem
to solve.

01:12:35.498 --> 01:12:36.599
We...

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600
we hung an innocent Indian
from a road sign.

01:12:39.602 --> 01:12:41.839
And my guess is White Bull's
not gonna like that.

01:12:42.305 --> 01:12:46.542
So, has anyone got any ideas on
how we might set things right?

01:12:46.544 --> 01:12:48.913
Yeah, maybe we should apologize.

01:12:49.547 --> 01:12:51.515
Yeah?

01:12:51.782 --> 01:12:55.484
One little screw up shouldn't make us their
bitches. So we send them a short note.

01:12:55.486 --> 01:12:58.654
Hey, and what does
this, uh, short note say?

01:12:58.656 --> 01:13:02.991
I don't know. How about,
"Sorry about Tonto, won't happen again"?

01:13:05.663 --> 01:13:07.531
No.

01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:12.269
I'm thinking we need something with a
bit more oomph. Something from our heart.

01:13:29.755 --> 01:13:32.655
Yeah, cut off his head.
Stick it in a box and send it to them.

01:13:32.657 --> 01:13:34.624
Tell them he's the culprit.

01:13:34.626 --> 01:13:38.597
Tell them our old arrangement's
back in effect and good to go.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.878
Get that shit away from me, man.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.514
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:13:56.883 --> 01:14:00.985
We've got some of the best pot
stores in the world, man. All legal.

01:14:00.987 --> 01:14:04.824
But no, instead you choose to
smoke that dang reservation weed.

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.560
Maybe I like it better.

01:14:11.631 --> 01:14:13.833
- White people, man.
- Yeah.

01:14:16.502 --> 01:14:19.072
You know I had a rat
that was bigger than that thing.

01:14:23.911 --> 01:14:26.814
You should try smoking
that shit instead.

01:14:27.446 --> 01:14:28.548
That's gross.

01:14:32.485 --> 01:14:33.654
Mom!

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:40.093
She gets him this week,
father gets him next week.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:45.032
Can you imagine
sharing your own son?

01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:47.601
Damn.

01:14:50.537 --> 01:14:52.639
- Kehoe.
- <i>Hey, it's Kurt.</i>

01:14:53.975 --> 01:14:56.042
Hi, Kurt.

01:14:56.044 --> 01:14:58.046
<i>You don't deserve this intel.</i>

01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:02.884
- Intel?
- <i>First tell me you don't deserve it.</i>

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:05.452
I don't deserve it.
What you got?

01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:10.690
<i>A body. Dante Ferstel. Kehoe kid.
Found dead in a Denver alley.</i>

01:15:10.692 --> 01:15:12.959
<i>Smack overdose.
So, what's new, right?</i>

01:15:12.961 --> 01:15:15.494
<i>Just another
Saturday night sleeper.</i>

01:15:15.496 --> 01:15:18.933
<i>And here's the kicker.
Dante was a baggage monkey at the airport.</i>

01:15:20.468 --> 01:15:21.936
The Kehoe airport?

01:15:31.213 --> 01:15:32.580
Mr. Coxman.

01:15:33.648 --> 01:15:35.150
What can I do for you?

01:15:37.585 --> 01:15:38.620
It's about your son.

01:15:45.027 --> 01:15:49.164
- I didn't know if you'd heard about Dante Ferstel.
- Yeah. He died of an overdose.

01:15:52.868 --> 01:15:56.505
Dante worked with your son
at the airport, right?

01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:00.776
- Yeah.
- Did you know him?

01:16:01.677 --> 01:16:02.645
No.

01:16:02.878 --> 01:16:04.580
Kyle never mention him to you?

01:16:05.748 --> 01:16:06.917
No.

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:15.025
Is that it?

01:16:16.226 --> 01:16:17.827
I guess it is.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.102
I don't understand
why you're here.

01:16:26.836 --> 01:16:27.938
Truth?

01:16:29.139 --> 01:16:31.007
I don't think
your son was a junkie.

01:16:34.077 --> 01:16:36.846
And I don't think
Dante Ferstel was either.

01:16:38.282 --> 01:16:40.850
So, what do you think
happened to them?

01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:42.652
I don't know.

01:16:44.055 --> 01:16:47.691
I was hoping you might be able to
tell me something that could help.

01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:53.030
Sorry...

01:16:54.565 --> 01:16:55.833
I can't help you.

01:16:56.534 --> 01:16:59.670
You can't help me.
I got work to do.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.808
I understand.

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.244
Tape.

01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:08.180
Taser.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.215
Antibiotics.

01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:12.117
Antibiotics?

01:17:12.717 --> 01:17:14.618
Yeah, you ever been bitten
by a kid?

01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:19.992
Little bastards are nasty.
You almost wish you were bitten by a dog.

01:17:23.996 --> 01:17:25.030
Yes?

01:17:27.265 --> 01:17:28.266
Okay.

01:17:32.204 --> 01:17:33.705
We can't grab him yet.

01:17:34.139 --> 01:17:37.709
- Why not?
- They're sending a messenger.

01:17:47.153 --> 01:17:48.920
I am the messenger.

01:18:00.733 --> 01:18:02.702
Thank you for seeing me.

01:18:09.642 --> 01:18:13.946
He's been punished for his deed.
We want peace with you again.

01:18:14.381 --> 01:18:15.748
Okay.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:19.852
I appreciate the gift.

01:18:20.953 --> 01:18:22.555
It was thoughtful.

01:18:29.029 --> 01:18:31.865
You showed a lot of guts
coming here alone.

01:18:36.804 --> 01:18:39.073
But I need a son for a son.

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:18.012
Careful, man!
You might hit a kid.

01:19:23.685 --> 01:19:25.419
If you do it again,
I'll kill you.

01:19:25.421 --> 01:19:26.754
Yes?

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:29.891
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Hey, Ryan.

01:19:30.292 --> 01:19:32.861
Um, I'm taking you home today.

01:19:33.995 --> 01:19:36.363
But this is my mom's week
to pick me up.

01:19:36.365 --> 01:19:40.035
Yeah, I know, but she got stuck at the
dentist. Asked me to come and get you.

01:19:40.469 --> 01:19:41.636
What?

01:19:42.704 --> 01:19:43.771
We take him.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.741
- What about the messenger?
- We shot the messenger.

01:19:47.743 --> 01:19:50.444
I don't remember her telling me
about a trip to the dentist.

01:19:50.446 --> 01:19:54.150
Yeah, she had a root canal
develop some problems.

01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:59.655
And your dad said could I pick you up.
So, here I am.

01:20:00.089 --> 01:20:03.225
- This is us here.
- What happened to the Tesla?

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.064
Shit!

01:20:38.895 --> 01:20:40.429
Seatbelt.

01:20:40.431 --> 01:20:42.899
- Where's the kid?
- He got away in a van.

01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:45.169
What kind of a van?

01:20:46.103 --> 01:20:47.438
Said "Kehoe" on it.

01:20:48.772 --> 01:20:51.806
We'll find the kid. We'll find the van.
It won't take us long.

01:20:51.808 --> 01:20:54.910
Get rid of these two
before they start to stink.

01:21:07.526 --> 01:21:09.193
Answer the phone.

01:21:17.835 --> 01:21:18.869
Hello?

01:21:21.573 --> 01:21:24.476
No, he can't talk right now.

01:21:26.511 --> 01:21:27.913
Because he's dead.

01:21:30.482 --> 01:21:33.116
Let's go. Three cars.

01:21:33.118 --> 01:21:34.519
What about the body?

01:21:38.423 --> 01:21:40.892
Minya, take care of this.

01:21:41.426 --> 01:21:44.497
I'm busy.
Let the fucking Indian do it.

01:21:58.010 --> 01:22:00.280
You don't work for my father,
do you?

01:22:05.151 --> 01:22:07.253
Who were those guys anyways?

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.088
I don't know.

01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:14.260
You don't have to worry
about them.

01:22:15.128 --> 01:22:16.029
Right.

01:22:20.366 --> 01:22:22.503
They can't take my son
and not call.

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:25.238
That's not how it's done.

01:22:27.408 --> 01:22:29.443
Those tepee asswipes.

01:22:31.278 --> 01:22:32.912
Those goddamn alkies.

01:22:35.282 --> 01:22:39.586
I'm gonna take one of them, I'm gonna hang
them from every road sign from here to Utah.

01:22:40.587 --> 01:22:43.991
You take a man's son, you call!
Everybody knows that!

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:49.563
I mean, they took my boy.

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:52.497
My little boy.

01:22:52.499 --> 01:22:55.000
Are you insane!
This is my week.

01:22:55.002 --> 01:23:00.272
You pick him up without asking? Are you
so damn stupid you'd kidnap your own son?

01:23:00.274 --> 01:23:04.912
I can't wait to watch my lawyer write
up the new arrangement. Full custody.

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:09.915
You'll be lucky to get him two
hours a month. Two supervised hours.

01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:11.917
A cop in the room with you,
watching you play.

01:23:11.919 --> 01:23:14.287
You won't get him alone until
he graduates from high school.

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:18.093
A public high school! With normal kids.
And no stupid diets!

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:25.367
I guess you won't be doing that again.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.903
Right? Uh-huh.

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.242
He's not here.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.944
- What?
- Ah...

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:55.431
Turn that song off.

01:24:01.971 --> 01:24:05.207
It's a text.
From a different number.

01:24:06.576 --> 01:24:10.346
"Sequoia Motel. Room twelve."

01:24:10.614 --> 01:24:12.616
"Steve Jobs, baby."

01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:31.268
Hello.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.942
A little peepee tepee.

01:25:11.075 --> 01:25:12.577
Oh, shit.

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:29.058
I know how this world works. They call with
their demands. I give them what they want.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.295
We get Ryan back.

01:25:32.731 --> 01:25:36.600
In 24 hours, I call the police.

01:25:36.602 --> 01:25:39.104
In 24 hours, he'll be home.

01:25:39.505 --> 01:25:41.707
- You'll burn in hell for this.
- Yeah.

01:25:42.307 --> 01:25:43.575
I'll see you there.

01:26:33.159 --> 01:26:35.460
Welcome to Kehoe Chateau Montclair.

01:26:35.462 --> 01:26:39.398
- We need rooms tonight.
- I'm sorry, you need a reservation.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.534
Excuse me.

01:26:41.302 --> 01:26:42.503
A reservation.

01:26:43.771 --> 01:26:44.838
Really?

01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:51.510
A reser... Oh! No,
I didn't mean it like that.

01:26:51.512 --> 01:26:54.646
I meant you need to reserve...
book before you get here

01:26:54.648 --> 01:26:56.816
because we're all full.
That's all I meant.

01:26:56.818 --> 01:26:59.251
You know what I heard?

01:26:59.253 --> 01:27:02.855
You told me and my friends that we
need to go back to the reservation.

01:27:02.857 --> 01:27:04.158
Oh, no.

01:27:05.159 --> 01:27:08.563
Do you have any idea
what I can do to you...

01:27:09.397 --> 01:27:10.264
on Yelp?

01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:15.167
You might wanna get
your boss out here.

01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:17.739
Or you could take another look.

01:27:19.474 --> 01:27:21.343
I will take another look.

01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:36.224
- You hungry?
- Sure.

01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:41.929
Eggs?

01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:43.164
Okay.

01:27:50.272 --> 01:27:52.508
- You live here?
- Yeah.

01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.380
All alone?

01:27:58.848 --> 01:27:59.815
Yeah.

01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:03.653
You don't have any kids?

01:28:06.222 --> 01:28:07.256
No.

01:28:25.609 --> 01:28:26.677
You like rock?

01:28:27.778 --> 01:28:29.312
I like classical.

01:28:47.297 --> 01:28:50.735
It wasn't very smart
bringing me to your house.

01:28:52.737 --> 01:28:53.771
Why?

01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:00.845
I want to talk to your dad.

01:29:01.779 --> 01:29:02.814
Tonight?

01:29:03.681 --> 01:29:04.849
In the morning.

01:29:14.026 --> 01:29:16.895
They're a bit greasy.

01:29:26.872 --> 01:29:29.508
You said you didn't
have any kids.

01:29:29.875 --> 01:29:31.610
He went away.

01:29:32.377 --> 01:29:33.746
Go on, get in bed.

01:29:38.684 --> 01:29:40.452
Where are you gonna sleep?

01:29:40.886 --> 01:29:43.553
In my room, down the hall.

01:29:43.555 --> 01:29:46.857
- What if I run away?
- There's nowhere for you to go, kid.

01:29:46.859 --> 01:29:49.493
You'd freeze to death
out there. Goodnight.

01:29:49.495 --> 01:29:51.996
I always get read
a story before bed.

01:29:51.998 --> 01:29:56.770
- I don't know any stories.
- You can read me anything. I don't care what it is.

01:30:00.607 --> 01:30:04.577
The new C-130 is the crème
de la crme of snow-pushers.

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:08.813
Built to humble Mother Nature,
she has a rated load of three tons.

01:30:08.815 --> 01:30:14.051
The Overhausen UTV attachment snow
blowers are made for universal use,

01:30:14.053 --> 01:30:16.888
equipped with powerful
modern engines.

01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:19.659
They're extremely effective
and flexible.

01:30:19.926 --> 01:30:23.630
A capacity of four thousand
tons of snow per hour.

01:30:24.664 --> 01:30:26.934
Throwing distance
of a hundred feet.

01:30:28.803 --> 01:30:29.702
Yeah.

01:30:30.938 --> 01:30:33.406
She is a great machine,
all right.

01:30:33.741 --> 01:30:35.042
I've got one of these.

01:30:36.409 --> 01:30:38.378
I thought you were a kidnapper.

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.615
Not all the time.

01:30:43.417 --> 01:30:46.020
Well, can I get a ride in it?

01:30:48.756 --> 01:30:50.391
You are going to sleep.

01:31:06.174 --> 01:31:09.711
Have you heard
of the Stockholm Syndrome?

01:31:57.894 --> 01:31:59.395
Morning, boss.

01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:01.163
Did you find him?

01:32:02.164 --> 01:32:04.932
Not yet. We will.

01:32:04.934 --> 01:32:07.135
Mr. White Bull.

01:32:07.137 --> 01:32:10.671
These are some complimentary ski passes.
Good for the whole weekend.

01:32:10.673 --> 01:32:13.241
For you and all of your...
friends.

01:32:13.243 --> 01:32:16.811
And I just wanna thank you again
for choosing to stay with us.

01:32:16.813 --> 01:32:19.983
We know that you do have
other entertainment options.

01:32:22.085 --> 01:32:23.053
Thank you.

01:32:24.788 --> 01:32:27.724
- Janitor from Ryan's school.
- Janitor, why not?

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:31.428
It's an honor to be here.
You hear the whispers but...

01:32:32.796 --> 01:32:35.032
- You have something for me?
- I might.

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.803
The van your boy got into.
I've seen it before.

01:32:40.804 --> 01:32:43.074
And the guy that was driving
that van, I've seen him too.

01:32:43.573 --> 01:32:47.176
Me and my family go up
to the resort in Kehoe.

01:32:47.178 --> 01:32:49.981
- You know, the fancy one? Chateau Montclair.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:50.214 --> 01:32:54.050
Well, we're driving up and, you
know, she scoots over and she's...

01:32:54.052 --> 01:32:58.156
showing a little appreciation
on the way up, you get my drift?

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:00.191
- I do.
- Yeah.

01:33:00.591 --> 01:33:02.858
You ever tried to keep the wheel
straight when someone's...

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.861
The van.

01:33:08.434 --> 01:33:11.803
Well, like I was saying.
The van that stopped to help me...

01:33:13.571 --> 01:33:15.673
that's the same van
that your boy got into.

01:33:16.308 --> 01:33:18.977
And the guy who pulled me
out of the ditch that night...

01:33:20.012 --> 01:33:21.981
he's the same guy
that picked up your boy.

01:33:22.281 --> 01:33:24.816
He's got one of those names
that you never ever forget.

01:33:25.951 --> 01:33:26.919
Coxman.

01:33:28.787 --> 01:33:29.888
Coxman.

01:33:30.555 --> 01:33:33.924
Yeah. We laughed about it
all night long.

01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:36.729
- Because what she was doing...
- Oh my God.

01:33:37.663 --> 01:33:41.865
- Coxman had a relative.
- And he hasn't spoken with the cops.

01:33:41.867 --> 01:33:45.102
Well... how much
did my guy offer you?

01:33:45.104 --> 01:33:46.505
Ten grand.

01:33:47.172 --> 01:33:48.807
Ten grand it is.

01:34:42.997 --> 01:34:44.965
Hey! Hey, check him out.

01:34:45.633 --> 01:34:48.736
You're crazy, Avalanche!

01:34:50.638 --> 01:34:51.872
You sure you've
done this before?

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.341
I was born to fly, white boy.

01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:36.182
I have your son.
If you wanna see him alive, come alone.

01:35:36.184 --> 01:35:37.919
Yeah, yeah.
I know how it's done.

01:35:38.887 --> 01:35:40.289
So, how much
do you want for him?

01:35:41.591 --> 01:35:46.628
We'll talk about that when you get here.
2210 Quarry Road. Kehoe.

01:35:47.196 --> 01:35:51.934
I'm just leaving Denver.
It's gonna take me about three hours.

01:36:22.232 --> 01:36:23.367
Jesus Christ.

01:36:31.074 --> 01:36:32.109
Son of a...

01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:43.388
- Hey.
- Hey. Taking a day off?

01:36:44.054 --> 01:36:46.924
- Main road could use a plow.
- I'll get to it soon.

01:36:49.527 --> 01:36:51.462
My nephew. Visiting.

01:36:52.263 --> 01:36:54.829
Must be a comfort
to have family in town.

01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:56.867
We saw all the cars
at your place.

01:37:00.405 --> 01:37:01.339
Yeah.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:10.448
Look at this.

01:37:12.283 --> 01:37:14.450
- So now we know he's banging a hippie.
- No.

01:37:14.452 --> 01:37:17.055
On the truck. The company name.

01:37:18.223 --> 01:37:21.192
- Open Road.
- It's four miles away.

01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:23.995
- Get the men.
- Let's go.

01:37:33.838 --> 01:37:37.042
- That was so much fun!
- I need you...

01:37:37.476 --> 01:37:38.911
to sit here...

01:37:39.845 --> 01:37:42.181
and wait till someone comes
to get you.

01:37:56.028 --> 01:37:58.498
- <i>They're headed to Open Road Garage.</i>
- Again. Say what?

01:38:00.433 --> 01:38:02.302
Open Road Garage.

01:38:04.504 --> 01:38:05.938
<i>On Old Bend Road.</i>

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.074
Ryan!

01:38:40.408 --> 01:38:43.275
Come on. Inside. Come on, move.

01:38:43.277 --> 01:38:46.447
- Why do you have a rifle?
- Just do what I say. Up the stairs, move.

01:38:48.082 --> 01:38:49.283
Get in the cabinet.

01:38:52.386 --> 01:38:53.988
Why are you mad at me?

01:38:54.622 --> 01:38:56.891
I'm not mad at you. It's just...

01:38:57.525 --> 01:39:00.328
It's just really important
you do what I say.

01:39:01.962 --> 01:39:03.064
You're a good kid.

01:39:04.098 --> 01:39:06.368
- What?
- I said don't move.

01:40:50.775 --> 01:40:52.644
The last Coxman.

01:40:58.216 --> 01:41:00.951
Where is my son?

01:41:03.321 --> 01:41:07.190
My business can get very creative,
but I'm an old fashioned kind of guy.

01:41:07.192 --> 01:41:09.093
I like to keep things simple.

01:41:10.094 --> 01:41:14.664
So if I have to ask you again,
I'm gonna pull out your fingernails...

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:18.203
cut off your fingers,
chop off your hands...

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:20.472
and hack off your nose.

01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.477
Oh, and that part
about the nose,

01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:28.812
you are really not gonna
like that part.

01:41:28.814 --> 01:41:30.749
You don't deserve your son.

01:41:34.286 --> 01:41:35.421
Take him to the garage.

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.685
Bastard!

01:46:35.897 --> 01:46:39.033
<i>Got a kid driving
a snow blower headed towards Kehoe.</i>

01:46:55.416 --> 01:46:57.318
Get a message...

01:46:57.885 --> 01:46:59.320
to Aya.

01:47:03.825 --> 01:47:05.426
Tell my wife...

01:47:08.864 --> 01:47:10.462
tell her she's a...

01:47:37.626 --> 01:47:38.994
What are you doing?

01:47:39.728 --> 01:47:40.729
My job.
