00:16.484 --> 00:18.651
It's time, Ryan.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.253
Time for what?

00:20.254 --> 00:23.290
We gotta get to the
Baker Street dog park.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.993
Jellybeans is throwing a party.

00:24.994 --> 00:27.095
Jellybeans? That golden
retriever you hate?

00:27.096 --> 00:28.897
Nah, Beans is my boy now!

00:28.898 --> 00:30.232
Say what you want about Beans,

00:30.233 --> 00:32.202
but dude knows how
to do it up right.

00:32.203 --> 00:33.438
There might even
be a sprinkler.

00:33.439 --> 00:35.408
Shit.

00:35.409 --> 00:37.741
Kristen's on her way over
to my house.

00:37.742 --> 00:40.108
I thought she was running
a brothel in India.

00:40.109 --> 00:41.742
It's a birthing clinic.

00:41.743 --> 00:43.812
Right, a brothel
supply company.

00:43.813 --> 00:45.180
Same difference.

00:45.181 --> 00:47.448
I don't know how
I'm gonna face her.

00:47.449 --> 00:49.150
How could I blackmail
my own sister?

00:49.151 --> 00:50.318
You also destroyed
her marriage,

00:50.319 --> 00:51.786
don't forget that.

00:51.787 --> 00:53.354
I think about it every day.

00:53.355 --> 00:55.624
What I did was despicable.
"Was."

00:55.625 --> 00:58.060
You sent that long
e-mail apology months ago.

00:58.061 --> 01:00.095
Get over it.

01:00.096 --> 01:02.790
Do you know how long
dogs feel guilty?

01:02.791 --> 01:04.415
Five seconds, then we move on.

01:04.416 --> 01:06.712
Where'd you get those glasses?

01:06.713 --> 01:09.114
You like 'em?
Beans got a pair a month ago

01:09.115 --> 01:11.049
and he's been snout-deep
in puss ever since.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.184
You stole them, didn't you?

01:17.989 --> 01:21.424
Sorry, Ryan. I shouldn't
have done that.

01:21.425 --> 01:23.260
I'm not proud of myself.
I guess I just...

01:24.695 --> 01:26.496
And... that's enough
of that.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.533
See? No more guilt.

01:31.603 --> 01:34.272
Jellybeans! I'm running
a bit late, dude,

01:34.273 --> 01:37.508
but I'm definitely gonna show.
Is the sprinkler still going?

01:37.509 --> 01:40.511
It's Wilfred.

01:40.512 --> 01:42.613
Wilfred Mueller.

01:42.614 --> 01:45.482
Come on, J-Beans,
you remember me, dawg!

01:45.483 --> 01:47.884
What do you mean,
no one calls you J-Beans?

01:47.885 --> 01:49.152
I call you J-Beans.

01:49.153 --> 01:51.288
Wait, J-Beans!

01:53.859 --> 01:55.192
Dropped call.

01:56.828 --> 01:58.228
That's her.

01:58.229 --> 01:59.697
Behave.

02:04.335 --> 02:05.669
<i>Sat sri akal!</i>

02:05.670 --> 02:07.538
Hey, welcome back.

02:07.539 --> 02:08.906
Oh.

02:10.044 --> 02:12.242
Jesus, who gets fat in India?

02:12.243 --> 02:13.744
Wow, are you...?

02:13.745 --> 02:16.513
I am. In three months,
you'll be an uncle.

02:16.514 --> 02:18.613
Whoa, whoa! Is there a baby
in there? A human baby?

02:18.614 --> 02:20.850
No! She can't come in here!
Wilfred!

02:20.851 --> 02:23.052
<i>Sat sri akal to you,
too, Wilfred.</i>

02:23.053 --> 02:24.720
Um, just make yourself
comfortable,

02:24.721 --> 02:26.489
and I'll make us some tea.

02:26.490 --> 02:28.291
Wilfred, come on.

02:29.827 --> 02:31.327
What the hell's
gotten into you?

02:31.328 --> 02:33.263
What the hell's gotten
into you?

02:33.264 --> 02:34.598
How could you let that Trojan
horse into this house?

02:34.599 --> 02:36.667
Trojan horse?

02:36.668 --> 02:38.669
There's a war out there, Ryan.

02:38.670 --> 02:41.372
The war between dogs
and babies.

02:41.373 --> 02:43.440
And you brought it
to our doorstep.

02:43.441 --> 02:45.910
You're at war with
babies? Over what?

02:45.911 --> 02:48.146
Why do any great civilizations
go to war?

02:48.147 --> 02:50.414
To see who's cutest.

02:50.415 --> 02:52.116
Through the millennia,

02:52.117 --> 02:57.255
under the unseeing eyes
of mankind, we have done battle.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.891
The rivers have run red
with blood,

02:59.892 --> 03:02.994
and towers of mutilated
corpses have cast shadows

03:02.995 --> 03:06.064
upon entrail-laden battlefields.

03:06.065 --> 03:07.566
It was dogs versus babies,

03:07.567 --> 03:10.702
so it was still
pretty cute, but...

03:10.703 --> 03:12.437
So call a truce.

03:12.438 --> 03:14.073
Just take it easy on Kristen.

03:14.074 --> 03:15.975
Take it easy?

03:15.976 --> 03:17.743
Did those babies take it easy

03:17.744 --> 03:20.279
at the massacre on the border
of The Canine Cabana

03:20.280 --> 03:21.380
and Norma's Day Care?

03:25.219 --> 03:27.587
So, Dr. Ramos is
the father?

03:27.588 --> 03:30.390
Yeah. We realized we loved
each other in India.

03:30.391 --> 03:34.061
He flew back early and broke
things off with his wife.

03:34.062 --> 03:35.562
Sounds like things
are going really well.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.732
Blessings and peace
are upon me.

03:38.733 --> 03:41.802
Look, I don't know
if you got my e-mail,

03:41.803 --> 03:45.640
but I feel really terrible
about what I...

03:45.641 --> 03:47.975
<i>Ksama.
What?</i>

03:47.976 --> 03:50.845
<i>Ksama, Ryan.
It means "forgiveness."</i>

03:50.846 --> 03:54.249
It's one of the most sacred
words in the Hindu culture.

03:57.386 --> 03:58.819
<i>Ksama.</i>

03:58.820 --> 04:00.087
Okay, but I still...

04:00.088 --> 04:02.623
<i>Ksama.</i>

04:02.624 --> 04:05.493
Relax, little baby.
I'm cool.

04:05.494 --> 04:08.863
I'm just here to talk.

04:08.864 --> 04:13.702
Look, this war has gone on
far too long.

04:13.703 --> 04:15.437
Maybe it's time we
end this madness.

04:15.438 --> 04:18.839
I mean, how many babies' faces
need to get bitten?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.509
How many dogs' ears need

04:20.510 --> 04:22.110
to be played with
not gently enough?

04:22.111 --> 04:25.313
We can do something
great here, you and I.

04:25.314 --> 04:27.449
<i>A change, a real change.</i>

04:27.450 --> 04:29.684
I have never felt such a sense
of community...

04:29.685 --> 04:31.519
What, what?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.121
Do I have a spare "dikfor"?

04:33.122 --> 04:35.423
What's a dikfor?
What's a dikfor?

04:35.424 --> 04:37.893
India was life-changing.

04:37.894 --> 04:40.296
Ha-ha. You think you're cute?
This is war.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.335
So, how-how was India?

04:45.336 --> 04:48.705
Were you not listening
to anything that I've just said?

04:48.706 --> 04:50.874
Sorry, I got distracted.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.376
That's okay.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.578
<i>Ksama.</i>

04:54.579 --> 04:57.047
I have to pee.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.148
Always have to pee.

05:00.184 --> 05:03.022
She's still mad at me.
What are you talking about?

05:03.023 --> 05:04.727
She just ksama'd the shit
out of you.

05:04.728 --> 05:06.896
Hey, what are you doing?

05:06.897 --> 05:08.665
Looking for an ultrasound.

05:08.666 --> 05:10.567
I need to know exactly
what I'm dealing with here.

05:10.568 --> 05:13.770
"Know your enemy."
Sun Tzu.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.239
Give me that.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.177
"Emergency Protective Order.

05:20.178 --> 05:22.546
Stalking."

05:22.547 --> 05:24.414
Wait. This is a restraining
order...

05:24.415 --> 05:25.716
from Arturo Ramos?

05:25.717 --> 05:27.584
Here we go.

05:27.585 --> 05:30.854
No Down Syndrome, no
spina bifida, no lobster hands.

05:30.855 --> 05:35.024
Jesus, this baby's gonna be
goddamn adorable.

05:35.025 --> 05:36.559
I can't believe this.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.828
Nothing she told me
about Arturo was true.

05:38.829 --> 05:40.296
So what?
That's her problem.

05:40.297 --> 05:42.532
Her problem, my fault.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.367
That's why she's lying to me,

05:44.368 --> 05:47.404
because I betrayed her
trust and ruined her life.

05:47.405 --> 05:50.073
I'm the worst brother ever.

05:50.074 --> 05:51.975
Worst brother ever?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.677
Did you ever convince
the other siblings

05:53.678 --> 05:55.378
in your litter to eat
your runt sister

05:55.379 --> 05:56.713
because she was born
with no eyes?

05:56.714 --> 05:58.515
'Cause I did that.

05:58.516 --> 06:01.118
I need to make this up to her.
An apology is not enough.

06:01.119 --> 06:03.621
As much as I love India,

06:03.622 --> 06:05.523
it's nice not to have
a swarm of insects

06:05.524 --> 06:07.024
trailing my ass
out of the bathroom.

06:07.025 --> 06:09.660
Hey, I was gonna ask you,

06:09.661 --> 06:11.596
Arturo just got us a condo
in Brentwood,

06:11.597 --> 06:13.531
and he's having
the kitchen redone,

06:13.532 --> 06:15.700
but all that construction noise
wouldn't be good for the baby.

06:15.701 --> 06:17.336
So, um, could I stay with you
a couple days?

06:17.337 --> 06:19.104
I mean, if it's not
too much trouble.

06:19.105 --> 06:20.773
Hell, no.
Sure.

06:20.774 --> 06:22.174
It'll give us a chance
to catch up.

06:22.175 --> 06:24.076
Ryan, what are you doing?!
Great.

06:24.077 --> 06:26.312
Well, I'll just grab
my bags from the rental car.

06:26.313 --> 06:28.414
Actually, maybe you should
grab 'em.

06:28.415 --> 06:30.716
Maybe you could also return
the rental car tonight?

06:30.717 --> 06:31.984
And pick me up some kale?

06:31.985 --> 06:33.586
Sure.

06:33.587 --> 06:36.155
I'm gonna lie down.
Mind if I use your room?

06:38.158 --> 06:40.693
What? All I did was agree

06:40.694 --> 06:42.728
to let my pregnant sister
stay with me.

06:42.729 --> 06:44.330
And do you feel better?

06:44.331 --> 06:47.133
Has your guilt been alleviated?
No.

06:47.134 --> 06:50.703
Because guilt doesn't go away
until you let it go.

06:50.704 --> 06:52.705
It just keeps piling up.

06:52.706 --> 06:55.174
Just like the brave,
dead soldiers

06:55.175 --> 06:57.544
at The Battle of Babies R Us
Parking Lot.

06:57.545 --> 06:59.046
You're just mad because
that baby's gonna take

06:59.047 --> 07:00.881
attention away from you.

07:00.882 --> 07:03.650
Oh, I don't think that's
gonna be a problem, Ryan.

07:03.651 --> 07:05.585
I know how to deal with a baby.

07:16.063 --> 07:18.532
This watermelon's
delicious, by the way.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.688
I was just reading
this study about this girl

07:26.689 --> 07:28.022
who had her dead,
parasitic twin's face

07:28.023 --> 07:30.025
embedded in her back.

07:30.026 --> 07:31.526
You should've seen the picture.

07:31.527 --> 07:34.763
Seriously, it looked
like it was smiling.

07:34.764 --> 07:36.598
Here, have a bite
of this squid taco.

07:36.599 --> 07:38.467
Funny, I'm not hungry anymore.

07:38.468 --> 07:40.469
You've never dated a scientist
before, have you?

07:40.470 --> 07:42.905
Nope. And if we're gonna
continue seeing each other,

07:42.906 --> 07:46.308
you need to promise to never
mention back-faces again.

07:46.309 --> 07:48.810
No deal.

07:48.811 --> 07:51.346
Come on.
I really want to kiss you,

07:51.347 --> 07:53.915
but I don't wanna be the
only one with squid breath.

07:53.916 --> 07:56.417
Okay.
Okay. On three, ready?

07:56.418 --> 08:00.654
One, two, three.

08:00.655 --> 08:03.156
Oh! You didn't eat it.

08:03.157 --> 08:05.125
I have a meeting.
But at least now

08:05.126 --> 08:07.160
I know you're not gonna be
kissing anyone else.

08:07.161 --> 08:09.663
Oh, yeah, perfect.

08:12.167 --> 08:14.068
It's my sister.

08:14.069 --> 08:15.536
<i>Okay. MythBusters marathon
this weekend?</i>

08:15.537 --> 08:17.471
Confirmed.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.375
Hey, Kristen.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.977
You bought the wrong kale.

08:22.978 --> 08:24.746
There's a wrong kale?

08:24.747 --> 08:26.915
The curly leaf is the one
with all the B vitamins, but...

08:26.916 --> 08:29.217
it's fine... one day without it
won't curve the baby's spine.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.620
What are you doing, Wilfred?!

08:31.621 --> 08:32.955
Wilfred's with you?

08:32.956 --> 08:34.457
Yeah, he's been underfoot
all day.

08:34.457 --> 08:36.225
I almost tripped over him
at the top of the stairs.

08:37.695 --> 08:39.229
Put him on!

08:39.230 --> 08:42.799
Put him on?
Out. Put him outside.

08:42.799 --> 08:47.337
♪ One, two,
vacuum's coming for you ♪

08:47.338 --> 08:53.510
♪ Three, four, your mom
is an unwed whore... ♪

08:53.511 --> 08:54.745
I'm coming home.

08:56.414 --> 08:59.583
Oh, my God, Kristen,
are you okay?

08:59.584 --> 09:02.119
I was chanting!
What the hell is wrong with you?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.721
I thought something
was wrong with the baby.

09:03.722 --> 09:05.489
Ryan, getting upset

09:05.490 --> 09:07.324
at this point in my pregnancy
is dangerous for me.

09:07.325 --> 09:08.326
Sorry.

09:08.327 --> 09:09.894
<i>Ksama!</i>

09:09.895 --> 09:12.030
You know what?
I'm gonna go take a bath.

09:12.031 --> 09:13.198
Where do you keep your razor?

09:14.534 --> 09:16.569
Never mind. I'll find it.

09:16.570 --> 09:17.970
Hello, Ryan.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.605
Slow day at the office?

09:19.606 --> 09:21.841
Wilfred, you have to stop this!
I don't know

09:21.842 --> 09:23.209
what you're talking
about, mate.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.844
Last night you switched her
prenatal vitamins

09:24.845 --> 09:26.045
for morning-after pills.

09:26.046 --> 09:27.580
And then you...

09:27.581 --> 09:28.814
What are you doing?

09:28.815 --> 09:32.519
That ol' black magic... voodoo.

09:33.754 --> 09:36.890
It works, Ryan.

09:36.891 --> 09:38.258
Watch this.

09:48.169 --> 09:49.669
You like that?

09:49.670 --> 09:51.237
Yeah, I do like that.

09:51.238 --> 09:54.140
Oh, you feel so good.

09:54.141 --> 09:58.411
Teeth, Wilfred, teeth!

10:00.448 --> 10:02.082
Oh! Oh! I'm gonna...!

10:05.386 --> 10:06.620
What the hell, dude?!

10:06.621 --> 10:07.821
Ah!

10:07.822 --> 10:09.723
Just stop!

10:09.724 --> 10:10.991
I will never stop!

10:13.061 --> 10:16.631
There's nothing you can do
to keep me from that baby.

10:16.632 --> 10:18.833
She's the one who
should be behind bars!

10:18.834 --> 10:20.768
The way she's working
your guilt is criminal!

10:20.769 --> 10:23.437
If you keep this up,
you'll be an outside dog.

10:29.210 --> 10:31.278
I'm sorry about all
the hairs in the bathtub.

10:31.279 --> 10:32.846
I didn't even get to my legs.

10:32.847 --> 10:34.648
That-that's okay.

10:34.649 --> 10:35.983
I'll just, uh...

10:35.984 --> 10:37.785
Clean the bathtub?
Thank you.

10:37.786 --> 10:40.321
It's just, it's really tough
for me to bend down so low,

10:40.322 --> 10:42.356
what with the beautiful soul
that's growing inside of me.

10:46.361 --> 10:48.929
So, what's this new company
you're working for?

10:48.930 --> 10:50.764
It's a biotech start-up.

10:50.765 --> 10:52.899
We're working on a
cure for lung cancer.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.203
Western medicine.

10:56.204 --> 10:59.240
Wasn't your clinic funded
by Kanner/McKay?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.974
I took their money,
not their drugs.

11:00.975 --> 11:02.642
I'm not gonna pollute
my body temple

11:02.643 --> 11:05.145
with the poison of Big Pharma.

11:05.146 --> 11:07.914
Well, a lot of those
"poisons" save lives.

11:07.915 --> 11:10.850
I suppose you're an expert now
that you're dating a scientist.

11:10.851 --> 11:12.786
We'll see how long that lasts.

11:12.787 --> 11:13.987
What does that mean?

11:13.988 --> 11:16.290
Nothing.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.194
It's just that, I mean,

11:21.195 --> 11:24.598
let's be honest,
a lawyer and a chemist?

11:24.599 --> 11:26.933
There's just not a lot
of overlap there.

11:26.934 --> 11:28.702
Amanda and I are
actually doing great.

11:28.703 --> 11:31.638
Sure you are.
But look at Arturo and me.

11:31.639 --> 11:33.240
We're both healers,

11:33.241 --> 11:35.575
<i>so our relationship
is based on a true love</i>

11:35.576 --> 11:37.410
and understanding
for one another.

11:37.411 --> 11:39.112
We'll have you over
for dinner sometime.

11:39.113 --> 11:40.847
You can see what
that looks like.

11:40.848 --> 11:42.549
In your new condo?

11:42.550 --> 11:44.017
Mm-hmm.

11:44.018 --> 11:47.288
Steady... steady...

11:47.289 --> 11:49.524
Uh, let me get you
some more juice.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.696
What?!

11:54.697 --> 11:56.365
How did you scale
that giant wall?

11:56.366 --> 11:58.333
That's impossible!

11:58.334 --> 12:01.570
Are you secretly some sort of
magical, otherworldly entity?

12:01.571 --> 12:03.539
'Cause I'd tell you if I was.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.374
That's it, Wilfred.
You're going outside.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.343
Stress is dangerous
for the baby.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.644
Is it now?

12:08.645 --> 12:11.814
Take your hands off me, Ryan!

12:11.815 --> 12:14.217
Or maybe I should take out
a restraining order...

12:14.218 --> 12:16.486
from my pocket, to use
as a bargaining chip

12:16.487 --> 12:18.754
to trade for my
baby-gettin' stick.

12:18.755 --> 12:21.157
We need to put
that back before...

12:21.158 --> 12:23.225
Before what? Before it
stresses Kristen out?

12:23.226 --> 12:24.359
Ryan?

12:24.360 --> 12:25.661
Whoops.
Is that...?

12:25.662 --> 12:28.196
Did you go through my things?

12:28.197 --> 12:30.498
Uh, no, I'm just...

12:30.499 --> 12:33.301
No, you're just curious about every
embarrassing detail of my life.

12:33.302 --> 12:36.104
Okay. Well, let me
just fill you in.

12:36.105 --> 12:37.906
The last time I saw Arturo was

12:37.907 --> 12:39.741
two weeks ago
at the airport in Jaipur.

12:39.742 --> 12:42.344
He was leaving early
to break things off with Liz.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.112
And then I never heard
from him.

12:44.113 --> 12:45.747
Instead of meeting me at LAX,

12:45.748 --> 12:50.018
he sent a process server
with a restraining order.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.920
All this time
I thought he loved me,

12:51.921 --> 12:56.091
but you know why he
wanted me to go to India?

12:56.092 --> 12:59.795
'Cause he thinks
I'm a good doctor!

12:59.796 --> 13:01.963
I'm so sorry.
Oh, are you?!

13:01.964 --> 13:03.598
I thought you'd be happy

13:03.599 --> 13:05.100
to learn another
humiliating secret

13:05.101 --> 13:06.601
to blackmail me with!

13:06.602 --> 13:08.403
Are you, are you okay?

13:08.404 --> 13:10.174
No, I don't know.
Just call 911.

13:10.175 --> 13:13.842
Yes! The Battle for Kristen's Bulge
has been won!

13:13.843 --> 13:16.844
It looks like I shall have
another fontanelle

13:16.845 --> 13:18.513
to hang from my belt.

13:18.514 --> 13:20.181
Wilfred, listen to yourself.

13:20.182 --> 13:22.984
We're talking about
an innocent human life.

13:22.985 --> 13:25.320
Oh, my God.

13:25.321 --> 13:27.088
You're right.

13:27.089 --> 13:29.657
What have I done?

13:29.658 --> 13:31.592
If anything happens
to that baby,

13:31.593 --> 13:33.327
I'll never forgive myself.

13:37.832 --> 13:42.035
Okay, so I have blue for a
boy or pink for a girl.

13:42.036 --> 13:45.771
Uh, hi. Yes, my sister may be
going through...

13:49.858 --> 13:51.525
The baby's okay, but she should
stay on bed rest

13:51.526 --> 13:53.627
for the next few days.

13:53.628 --> 13:55.862
It was just Braxton Hicks!
Go to medical school!

13:55.863 --> 13:57.097
Have fun with that.

13:57.098 --> 14:00.500
Why, God? Why?!

14:00.501 --> 14:04.370
What kind of
God lets a baby live?!

14:04.371 --> 14:05.805
Dr. Ramos.

14:05.806 --> 14:07.273
I got your message.
How's the baby?

14:07.274 --> 14:09.375
Fine.
Kristen's in the bedroom.

14:09.376 --> 14:11.244
You. You caused this!

14:11.245 --> 14:13.813
You almost ruined her life,
and you don't even care.

14:13.814 --> 14:15.415
What kind of animal are you?

14:15.416 --> 14:17.083
You're right.

14:17.084 --> 14:18.852
It's my fault.

14:18.853 --> 14:22.355
My-my wife made me take
out that restraining order.

14:22.356 --> 14:25.559
I didn't want to,
but I was scared.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.894
You have to believe me.

14:26.895 --> 14:28.795
I want to be with your sister.

14:28.796 --> 14:30.531
<i>EN: Arturo, is that you?!
Mi amor!</i>

14:30.532 --> 14:33.467
Great, now the father's here.

14:33.468 --> 14:36.570
How many innocent babies
need to survive

14:36.571 --> 14:39.607
before we put an end
to this senseless nurturing?!

14:41.543 --> 14:44.412
It's bad enough I have to sleep
on the couch in my own house.

14:45.914 --> 14:47.381
They've been at it all night.

14:47.382 --> 14:49.450
So kick 'em out.

14:49.451 --> 14:51.452
I can't do that.

14:53.555 --> 14:57.225
God, I'm such an idiot
for not duct-taping

14:57.226 --> 14:59.360
a pizza cutter
to the end of Arturo's penis.

14:59.361 --> 15:01.729
Will you stop?
Haven't you done enough damage?

15:01.730 --> 15:06.234
Fine. I give up.

15:07.837 --> 15:09.971
What's that?

15:09.972 --> 15:12.923
Baby food. Might as well get
used to it.

15:12.924 --> 15:15.035
This is what it's gonna be like
three months from now.

15:15.036 --> 15:16.611
Wilfred...
The war's over.

15:16.612 --> 15:18.280
I've lost.

15:18.281 --> 15:22.335
Stop. Look, have you ever
even known a baby?

15:22.336 --> 15:23.777
I think you might be surprised

15:23.778 --> 15:25.972
at how much dogs
and babies have in common.

15:25.973 --> 15:28.457
It's true.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.359
You both like to drool.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.662
You both need someone else
to clean up your shit.

15:32.663 --> 15:33.930
You both like naps.

15:33.931 --> 15:36.966
We both like chewing on things.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.267
Right?

15:38.268 --> 15:39.902
We both have vocabularies
that are...

15:39.903 --> 15:41.771
I mean, in a way,

15:41.772 --> 15:43.105
it's like you're actually
fighting yourselves.

15:43.106 --> 15:44.540
Vocabularious.

15:44.541 --> 15:46.676
Maybe it's time

15:46.677 --> 15:48.344
to call an end to hostilities

15:48.345 --> 15:50.213
and actually get to know
each other.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.749
Otherwise, all this tension...

15:52.750 --> 15:54.384
when's it gonna end?

15:56.253 --> 15:58.355
I could ask you
the same question, Ryan.

15:58.356 --> 16:01.258
<i>When is it gonna end?</i>

16:03.562 --> 16:05.229
She'll find a place soon.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.532
The guilt, mate.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.834
How long are you
gonna hold onto it?

16:15.207 --> 16:17.108
Until she forgives me.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.011
And what if she never does?

16:19.012 --> 16:21.747
You know, at some point,
you may just have

16:21.748 --> 16:23.349
to do the forgiving for her.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.750
Wilfred, you know,
you still have some...?

16:24.751 --> 16:25.985
Yeah, I do.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.062
Sweetie, I gotta go.
Oh.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.231
Uh, Ryan, thanks
for, uh, everything.

16:38.232 --> 16:40.233
Kristen said you don't
mind us using your house

16:40.234 --> 16:42.268
<i>as our little, uh,
palacio del amor.</i>

16:42.269 --> 16:43.736
I really appreciate that.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.071
Um, yeah.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.572
Oh.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.210
See you tomorrow night?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.846
What about tonight?

16:53.847 --> 16:57.917
Uh, Liz and I have
symphony tickets.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.421
They're... they're paid for.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.724
Have a nice time.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.035
Ryan, on your way home
from work,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.637
I need you to pick up a soft
bristle toothbrush for Arturo.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.807
His gums are really sensitive.

17:27.582 --> 17:30.551
Listen, I don't know
how comfortable I am

17:30.552 --> 17:32.453
with you guys using
my home as your

17:32.454 --> 17:34.922
<i>palacio del amor.</i>

17:34.923 --> 17:36.223
Well, that's interesting.

17:36.224 --> 17:37.658
Because under
the circumstances,

17:37.659 --> 17:39.093
I didn't think I was
asking all that much.

17:39.094 --> 17:41.529
Kristen, I know
you're mad at me,

17:41.530 --> 17:43.365
and I've been trying
to make it up to you,

17:43.366 --> 17:45.534
but I don't know how much
longer this can go on.

17:45.535 --> 17:47.135
Do you think that I wanted
to come here

17:47.136 --> 17:49.338
after the way you stabbed me
in the back?

17:49.339 --> 17:52.341
I have nowhere else
to go, Ryan.

17:52.342 --> 17:55.345
I'm a mistress... me!

17:55.346 --> 17:58.582
My marriage is dead,
and I'm gonna be a single mother

17:58.583 --> 18:00.618
raising a child whose father
already has another family,

18:00.619 --> 18:02.353
and it is all your fault!

18:02.354 --> 18:04.655
Kristen...
No, it is!

18:04.656 --> 18:09.326
It has to be all your fault,
because if it's not, then...

18:09.327 --> 18:11.195
then...

18:15.634 --> 18:17.668
Oh, shit.

18:22.007 --> 18:24.209
I'm the one who cheated
on Leo.

18:24.210 --> 18:27.379
And I followed
a total asshole to India.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.014
So, so...

18:32.785 --> 18:35.053
I did this.

18:38.691 --> 18:40.558
I'm a really terrible person.

18:42.561 --> 18:47.465
Everybody makes mistakes.

18:47.466 --> 18:49.367
Feeling guilty
isn't going to help.

18:53.706 --> 18:56.240
I know Arturo's a jerk,

18:56.241 --> 18:58.243
but...

18:58.244 --> 19:01.213
I don't want to be alone.

19:01.214 --> 19:03.515
You won't be.

19:08.053 --> 19:10.555
You're a good brother, Ryan.

19:18.631 --> 19:19.998
How about I make us some tea?

19:19.999 --> 19:21.600
Oh, that'd be nice.

19:24.370 --> 19:25.837
Hey, Wilfred.

19:25.838 --> 19:28.573
Look, I've been
thinking it over.

19:28.574 --> 19:31.009
Maybe after you're born,

19:31.010 --> 19:32.477
we could get to know
one another.

19:32.478 --> 19:34.779
Maybe you could even
fall asleep on me one day.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.815
Or I could eat some food out

19:36.816 --> 19:38.449
of your mouth while
you're yawning.

19:38.450 --> 19:39.884
Anyway, these are just ideas,

19:39.885 --> 19:43.588
but the gist is,
I wanna be friends.

19:43.589 --> 19:47.893
You want me to be
in your club?

19:47.894 --> 19:51.729
I'd love to be!
The Pen 15 Club?

19:51.730 --> 19:53.565
Hang on a minute.

19:53.566 --> 19:56.535
Just let me write that down
so I don't forget itt.

19:56.536 --> 20:00.272
So, it's just the word "pen"
and the number "15"

20:00.273 --> 20:04.141
with no spaces in between?

20:04.142 --> 20:05.576
Cool name, huh?

20:12.120 --> 20:13.287
Really? Are we
really gonna have

20:13.288 --> 20:14.989
this debate right now?

20:14.990 --> 20:16.657
'Cause we all know
life doesn't begin

20:16.658 --> 20:18.392
until the fetus is
ten years old.

20:18.393 --> 20:21.229
You have no morals.
Of course, I do.

20:21.230 --> 20:23.965
You kill an 11-year-old,
you're going straight to hell.

20:42.151 --> 20:45.753
What?
What are you smiling at?

20:45.754 --> 20:48.523
Who's smiling, dude?
It is hot in here!

20:48.524 --> 20:50.896
Oh. Do you want me to turn
the air-conditioning on?

20:50.897 --> 20:52.483
Yes!
