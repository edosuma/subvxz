[cheering]

00:28.378 --> 00:31.079
- How is it that that dummy won
a million dollars

00:31.147 --> 00:32.514
And I've never won
anything?

00:32.582 --> 00:35.017
- Oh, I'm sure
it's just a matter of time.

00:35.084 --> 00:37.319
- It'd better be,
because I don't want to end up

00:37.387 --> 00:39.454
A bitter, jealous person.

00:40.657 --> 00:43.258
Say, I should go
on a game show!

00:43.326 --> 00:45.594
- What game show
are you qualified for?

00:45.662 --> 00:47.930
- Uh, "wheel of words"?

00:47.997 --> 00:49.598
- You don't know
how to spell.

00:49.666 --> 00:51.166
- How about
"price is correct"?

00:51.234 --> 00:54.069
- How much do you think
this pack of gum sells for?

00:55.338 --> 00:56.605
- $33,000?

00:56.673 --> 00:58.340

- [gasps]
we should go on that.

We've been best friends forever.

01:10.019 --> 01:12.154
We know everything
there is to know
about each other.

01:12.221 --> 01:13.722
- I never thought
I would say this,

01:13.790 --> 01:16.491
But that's not a bad idea,
daffy duck.

01:16.559 --> 01:18.493
- Why, thank you, bugs...

01:18.561 --> 01:20.162
Uh...

of "besties!"

01:56.966 --> 01:58.400
- How'd you manage that?

01:58.468 --> 02:01.069
- There are some things
you shouldn't know about me.

02:01.137 --> 02:02.838
But you better know
everything else!

02:02.905 --> 02:05.540
- I'm more concerned with
how little you know about me.

02:05.608 --> 02:07.542
- I know everything about you.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.811
Hit me with some questions.
Go ahead.

02:09.878 --> 02:11.913
- All right.
What's my favorite color?

02:11.981 --> 02:13.081
- Pass.

02:13.149 --> 02:14.816
- What time do I go
to bed at night?

02:14.884 --> 02:16.918
- Pass.
Give me something easy.

02:16.986 --> 02:18.820
- Fine.
When's my birthday?

02:18.888 --> 02:22.157

02:50.753 --> 02:52.788
[screams]
- hey, speedy.

02:52.855 --> 02:54.122
- Hola, bugs.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.658
- You said you took care of
the rat problem.

02:56.726 --> 02:59.961
- I'm not a rat.
I'm a mouse.

03:00.029 --> 03:02.330
[door opens and shuts]

03:02.398 --> 03:04.566
- You don't know anything
about me.

03:04.634 --> 03:08.170
I bet if you look
"self-absorbed" up
in the dictionary,

03:08.237 --> 03:09.638
You'd find your picture.

03:09.705 --> 03:11.573
- My picture's
in the dictionary?

03:11.641 --> 03:13.575
Is it a good one?
What am I wearing?

03:13.643 --> 03:16.311
Does my beak look big?

03:16.379 --> 03:18.046
Aha. Gotcha!

03:20.516 --> 03:22.551
- This is hopeless.

03:22.618 --> 03:24.386
- Don't get mad at me.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.987
Those questions were impossible.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.290
I bet you don't know
when my birthday is.

03:28.357 --> 03:30.292
- Your birthday is April 17th.

03:30.359 --> 03:32.294
Your favorite color is
dusty rose,

03:32.361 --> 03:34.229
And you go to bed every night
at 10:00

03:34.297 --> 03:35.797
Except on new year's eve,

03:35.865 --> 03:38.400
When you go to bed
at 8:30 because, and I quote,

03:38.468 --> 03:41.636
"new year's is a holiday
invented by the media."

03:41.704 --> 03:43.638
- It is!
- Forget it.

03:43.706 --> 03:46.074
Find a different best friend
to go on that show.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.076
- But I need you!

03:48.144 --> 03:50.745
I prize prizes
above all else.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.014
This is my shot
at finally winning something.

03:53.082 --> 03:54.816
I'll do anything!

03:54.884 --> 03:57.486
- Even if it means focusing
on someone other than yourself

03:57.553 --> 03:58.987
For more than 2 minutes?

03:59.055 --> 04:00.589
- That sounds awful.

04:00.656 --> 04:02.958
But I'll do it.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.793
- [new England accent]
well, daffy,

04:04.861 --> 04:07.429
You know how I hate
to talk about myself,

04:07.497 --> 04:10.265
But leave us
turn back the clock.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.601
It was on the east side
of new york

04:12.668 --> 04:16.438
Where me parents resided
amidst humble surroundings.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.673
- [snoring]

04:20.676 --> 04:22.277
- [normal voice]
did I say new york?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.779
I meant the planet krypton.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.615
- [grunts]

04:26.682 --> 04:30.452
- Anywho, my parents knew
that our planet was doomed.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.688
[orchestra performing
"superman theme"]

04:37.960 --> 04:41.897
- So my father, jor-el...

04:41.964 --> 04:43.899
Built this spaceship.

04:43.966 --> 04:49.004
- His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.072
He'll be fast--

04:51.140 --> 04:53.275
Virtually invulnerable,

04:53.342 --> 04:57.512
And he'll say
"what's up, doc?"
indiscriminately,

04:57.580 --> 05:01.349
Whether he's speaking
to a doctor or not.

05:01.417 --> 05:04.219
You will travel far,
my little bugs.

05:04.287 --> 05:07.789
But we will never leave you.

05:17.266 --> 05:19.601
- You're from
the planet krypton?

05:19.669 --> 05:21.336
- No, you maroon!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.438
That's the story
of superman.

05:23.506 --> 05:25.040
- Who is superman?

05:25.107 --> 05:27.776
- I can't believe
I hitched my wagon to you.

05:27.843 --> 05:29.444
- You have a wagon?

05:29.512 --> 05:31.446
- Daffy! Concentrate!

05:33.849 --> 05:36.952
On me!
- Oh! Sorry, superman.

05:37.019 --> 05:41.356

05:51.609 --> 05:53.110
Let's meet our contestants.

05:53.178 --> 05:56.680
First up, bugs bunny
and daffy duck.

05:56.748 --> 05:57.915
- What's up, doc?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.516
- It's a pleasure
to be here, chuck.

05:59.584 --> 06:00.918
I'm a big fan.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.253
- Tell me, how long
have you two known each other?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.756
- 17 years.
- 5 years.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.525
- Looks like you two better get
on the same page.

06:08.593 --> 06:11.628
[laughter] and now,
let's meet your challengers.

06:11.696 --> 06:12.896
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:12.964 --> 06:14.298
- Oh, I'm sorry.
After you.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.133
- Oh, no, after you.
- No, after you. I insist.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.302
- I insist more.
- I have an idea.

06:18.369 --> 06:20.204
- Oh, you always have
good ideas.

06:20.271 --> 06:21.438
I can hardly wait to hear.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.907
- Well, you won't have to wait.
I'm about to tell you.

06:23.975 --> 06:25.743
- Oh, goody.
- My idea is that

06:25.810 --> 06:27.578
We both speak
simultaneously.

06:27.645 --> 06:28.746
- Wonderful idea!

06:28.813 --> 06:30.147
Both: Hello.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.319
- Bugs and daffy,
looks like you've got
some stiff competition.

06:35.386 --> 06:37.020
- Ok. Here's the first question.

06:37.088 --> 06:40.624
What is your roommate's
favorite vegetable?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.793
- Your favorite vegetable.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.064
Hmm. I'm going to go
with beets, chuck.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.398
[buzzer]
- ohh!

06:48.466 --> 06:51.468
- Uh-oh.
The correct answer was carrots.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.538
You know what that means!

06:55.540 --> 06:57.975
- [laughter]

06:58.042 --> 06:59.076
- Challengers?

06:59.144 --> 07:00.744
- Your favorite vegetable?

07:00.812 --> 07:02.646
Well, I know
he loves cauliflower.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.648
- Guilty!
I do love cauliflower.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.817
- But he has been known
to ask for seconds

07:06.885 --> 07:09.153
When I make sweet potatoes.
[indistinct]

07:09.220 --> 07:11.588
- You must try
his sweet potatoes.
They are divine.

07:11.656 --> 07:14.091
- But if I had to pick
his favorite vegetable,

07:14.159 --> 07:17.427
I would have to say
pureed butternut squash
in a balsamic reduction

07:17.495 --> 07:19.930
With just a hint
of clover.

07:19.998 --> 07:21.965
- That's correct!

07:22.033 --> 07:23.534
[applause]
[dings]

07:23.601 --> 07:25.569
- I knew you'd get that right!

07:25.637 --> 07:27.971
- Well, I knew that you knew
I'd get that right!

07:28.039 --> 07:31.141
[laughter]

07:31.209 --> 07:32.376
- Next question.

07:32.443 --> 07:35.245
What is your best friend's
middle name?

07:35.313 --> 07:38.549
- [giggles]
that's an easy one.
Sheldon.

[buzzer]
- aww!

07:39.951 --> 07:42.386

07:42.453 --> 07:43.887
- Armando?

07:43.955 --> 07:46.890
- You know what that means!

07:46.958 --> 07:48.325
- [laughter]

07:48.393 --> 07:51.461
- Bugs and daffy, you've got
some catching up to do.

07:51.529 --> 07:54.031
And you're going to have
a chance after the break.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.267
[cheering and applause]
[theme music plays]

07:57.335 --> 07:59.937
- Daffy, your middle name
is sheldon.

08:00.004 --> 08:04.208
- That may be true,
but armando sounds cooler.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.709
- Well, do you want
to sound cool,

08:05.777 --> 08:07.211
Or do you want to win?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.546
- I want to win!
[gulps]

08:09.614 --> 08:11.448
- Well, then,
we need a new strategy.

08:11.516 --> 08:14.952
In the next round,
whatever you're about to
say, say the opposite.

08:15.019 --> 08:17.154
- That's a great idea!

08:17.222 --> 08:20.691
I mean,
that's a horrible idea.

08:20.758 --> 08:21.859
[clicks]

08:21.926 --> 08:24.027
- Hello, competitors.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.496

08:26.564 --> 08:27.931

to wish us luck?

08:27.999 --> 08:29.132
- Not particularly.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.869
- I'll wish you luck.
- Why, thank you.

08:31.936 --> 08:33.871
And good luck

08:39.611 --> 08:42.212
The show about

- Remember,
say the opposite.

08:44.282 --> 08:45.382
[clicks]

08:45.450 --> 08:48.886
- Tell me, who does
your best friend most admire?

08:48.953 --> 08:52.789
- I want to say me,
but I guess I'll go with...

08:52.857 --> 08:53.957
Groucho marx?

08:54.025 --> 08:55.225
[dings]
[applause]

08:55.293 --> 08:58.195
- That's correct!

08:58.263 --> 09:02.065
- I was going to say
"take your daughter
to work day,"

09:02.133 --> 09:05.135
But instead, I'll say
"thanksgiving"?

09:05.203 --> 09:06.637
[dings]
- correct!

09:06.704 --> 09:08.472
[applause]

09:08.539 --> 09:10.574
- Everything in me is saying
rockabilly,

09:10.642 --> 09:12.309
But I'll go with smooth jazz.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.810

09:13.878 --> 09:15.479
- Correct!

09:15.546 --> 09:17.714

300 points.

09:32.764 --> 09:37.067
What is your best friend's
catch phrase?

09:37.135 --> 09:39.303
- If friends were flowers,
I'd pick you?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.537
[buzzer]
- ohh!

09:40.605 --> 09:43.607
- No, no. It's "laugh,
and the world laughs with you."

- Aww.

09:44.842 --> 09:49.179

You know what that means!

[laughter]
- ooh! Feathers!

09:51.849 --> 09:54.184
- Oh, what fun!
It's like a pillow fight!

09:54.252 --> 09:56.420
- [laughing
and talking indistinctly]

09:58.222 --> 10:01.425
- Bugs and daffy,
now you have a chance to win.

10:01.492 --> 10:04.494
Daffy, what is bugs bunny's
catchphrase?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.930
- Hmm. Think.
Catchphrase.

10:06.998 --> 10:09.766
- Really?
I say it all the time.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.501
- I know this.
I know this.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.037
- It's sort of
my go-to phrase.

10:14.105 --> 10:15.505
- It's right on
the tip of my tongue.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.108
- It's in the form
of a question.

10:18.176 --> 10:20.944
I say it
with a lot of sarcasm.

10:21.012 --> 10:22.713
Ehh...

10:22.780 --> 10:24.514
- I don't do mondays!

10:26.851 --> 10:28.452
- Aww!
- Ooh, I'm sorry!

10:28.519 --> 10:32.389
We were looking for
"what's up, doc?"

10:32.457 --> 10:34.992
And...
Say it with me.

10:35.059 --> 10:37.561
- You know what that means!

10:37.628 --> 10:40.364
- [scattered murmuring]

10:40.431 --> 10:41.999
[cheering and laughter]

10:42.066 --> 10:44.935
- That means
you're our winners!

10:45.003 --> 10:47.337
Gene, tell 'em
what they won!

10:47.405 --> 10:50.841
- A fabulous cruise!

10:50.908 --> 10:53.777
- A cruise? [laughs]
how exciting!

10:53.845 --> 10:56.346
We've always wanted
to go on a cruise!

10:56.414 --> 10:57.781
[muffled music plays]

10:57.849 --> 11:00.150
- That's your catchphrase?
"what's up, doc?"

11:00.218 --> 11:02.719
What does that even mean?
We don't even know any doctors.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.321
[thumping]
- ow! Ooh!

11:04.389 --> 11:05.756
Who's doing that?

11:05.823 --> 11:07.991
Ow! Oof! Oh!
[grunting]

11:17.927 --> 11:19.828
- "what's up, doc?"
terrible.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.663
Just the world's worst
catchphrase.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.999
And I don't remember
you ever saying it. Say it.

11:24.067 --> 11:25.734
- What's up, doc?

11:25.802 --> 11:27.970
- Nope.
Doesn't ring a bell.

11:28.037 --> 11:31.773
But it sure cost us
the game.

11:31.841 --> 11:35.644
- What cost us the game
was going on a game show
about best friends

11:35.712 --> 11:38.580
When it's obvious
that we're not.

11:38.648 --> 11:40.816
- You're saying
I'm not your best friend?

11:40.883 --> 11:43.118
Why? Because I don't know
anything about you?

11:43.186 --> 11:45.120
Because I never ask
any questions

11:45.188 --> 11:46.788
Or show any interest in you?

11:46.856 --> 11:48.390
Because I take you
for granted?

11:48.458 --> 11:52.861
Because if it is,
that's awfully petty of you.

11:52.929 --> 11:56.531
- My best friend
would probably know
that I like carrots.

11:56.599 --> 11:58.533
He would most likely know
my birthday,

11:58.601 --> 12:01.703
And he would definitely know
my last name.

12:01.771 --> 12:03.271
And for the record,

12:03.339 --> 12:06.708
I would have loved
to have won a cruise.

12:06.776 --> 12:10.178
And that is
what's up, doc.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.017
- That still
doesn't sound right.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.658
[birds singing
and distant dog barking]

12:25.161 --> 12:27.596
- Well. If he's not going
to open the door for me,

12:27.664 --> 12:30.666
I guess
I'll just let myself out.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.344
Oh. So I guess I also have
to make my own breakfast?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.550
I guess I have to peel
my own banana, too.

12:48.618 --> 12:51.119
- Hey, that's my banana!
- [gasps] a rat!

12:51.187 --> 12:53.121
- For the last time,
man, I'm a mouse!

12:53.189 --> 12:54.790
- Bugs, help!

12:54.857 --> 12:56.224
- Why should he help you?

12:56.292 --> 12:58.060
You didn't help him
on that game show last night.

12:58.127 --> 13:00.529
You know, you'd think
you'd show señor bunny
a little more respect,

13:00.596 --> 13:02.230
Considering he lets you
live here.

13:02.298 --> 13:03.899
- I don't live here.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.134
I'm just crashing here
until I get back
on my feet.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.137
- Fyi, when you crash somewhere
for 5 years,

13:09.205 --> 13:10.672
You live there.
All right?

13:10.740 --> 13:13.208
You're not a best friend.
You're a terrible friend.

13:13.276 --> 13:14.910
- Why am I
a terrible friend?

13:14.977 --> 13:16.912
- Let me answer that question
with a question.

13:16.979 --> 13:19.081
[chomps]

13:19.148 --> 13:21.950
How many friends do you have
besides señor bunny?

13:22.018 --> 13:24.186
- Well, let's see. You?

13:24.253 --> 13:26.021
- I'm not your friend.
- Ok, then.

13:26.089 --> 13:27.923
There's that guy
that comes over once a week,

13:27.990 --> 13:29.424
And we hang out
by the pool.

13:29.492 --> 13:32.494
I think his name is
fong or trang.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.864
- Are you talking
about the guy who comes to
clean the pool? [indistinct]

13:35.932 --> 13:37.365
You're kidding yourself, man.

13:37.433 --> 13:38.867
Señor bunny is
your only friend.

13:38.935 --> 13:41.169
If you're not careful,
soon, you'll have no friends.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.905
- Who needs friends?
- I'll tell you who--

13:43.973 --> 13:47.075
Someone with no girlfriend,
no job, no credit,

13:47.143 --> 13:49.077
No hobbies,
no social skills...

13:49.145 --> 13:52.013
- Wait. I think I know
someone like that. Daniel?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.249
- No, idiot. You.

13:55.518 --> 13:57.352
You're nothing
without señor bunny.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.854
- Then what do I do?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.689
- You got to try harder
to be his friend.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.191
- Like, how much harder?
Two percent?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.093
- More.
- Five percent?

14:05.161 --> 14:07.095
- More.
- Seven percent?

14:07.163 --> 14:08.930
Are you
out of your mind?

14:08.998 --> 14:10.532
- 100%.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.468
- What?
No one can give 100!

14:13.536 --> 14:15.604
It's physically impossible!

14:15.671 --> 14:17.539
- You got to dig deep.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.442
You got to go to
the place inside you
where you've never been.

14:20.510 --> 14:22.043
- My soul?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.813
- You need to have a soul
in order to go there.

14:24.881 --> 14:26.548
No, no, no.
I'm talking about in here.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.550
Now, try.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.785
- [gasps]

14:29.852 --> 14:31.386
[grunts]

14:31.454 --> 14:33.121
Ugh. That's good enough, right?

14:33.189 --> 14:34.890
- No. Look at me.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.460
You can do this.
Now, try.

14:38.528 --> 14:40.629
- [gasps and grunts]
- harder!

14:40.696 --> 14:42.798
- [grunting continues]

14:42.865 --> 14:45.600
It hurts!
- Harder!

14:45.668 --> 14:48.336
- I'm dying!

14:48.404 --> 14:51.306
- No! You're trying!

14:51.374 --> 14:54.476
- [grunting]

14:56.946 --> 15:01.616
I'm going to be
the best best friend

15:01.684 --> 15:05.787
That any best friend
has ever had!

15:05.855 --> 15:09.357
[laughing]

15:09.425 --> 15:10.692
- Uh-oh.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.196
- You can open your eyes now,
best friend.

15:14.263 --> 15:15.530
- Huh?
[foghorn]

15:15.598 --> 15:18.200
- Guess what? I got you
the cruise you wanted!

15:18.267 --> 15:19.968
- The one
from the game show?

15:20.036 --> 15:21.937
- Surprised?
Well, you shouldn't be.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.706
It's just what
one best friend would do
for another best friend.

15:24.774 --> 15:28.276
[salsa music playing]
[sea gulls crying]

15:34.951 --> 15:37.719
- Who knew cruising could be
so much fun?

15:37.787 --> 15:40.589
- I cannot remember
the last time I had
this much fun.

15:40.656 --> 15:43.225
- Hey, do you think
it's possible to have
too much fun?

15:43.292 --> 15:45.160
- Hmm! Interesting question.

15:45.228 --> 15:47.162
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.564
- Oh? And what might that be?
- Keep having fun!

15:49.632 --> 15:51.433
- [both laugh]
- game's over.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.368
You've been hogging the court
long enough.

15:53.436 --> 15:56.037
- Oh, hello!
- Fancy meeting you here!

15:56.105 --> 15:59.207
- Move it along, gophers.
It's my best friend's turn.

15:59.275 --> 16:03.245
Hey, bugsy, old pal.
A shuffle board court
opened up!

16:03.312 --> 16:05.247
- Daffy, I'm reading.

16:05.314 --> 16:07.549
I don't want to play
shuffleboard.

16:07.617 --> 16:09.885
- Yeah, me neither.

16:09.952 --> 16:11.319
[splashes]

16:11.387 --> 16:14.055
- Hmmph! There's only one thing
to do about that.

16:14.123 --> 16:15.724
- Limbo contest
on the leader deck?

16:15.791 --> 16:17.058
- [both laugh]

16:17.126 --> 16:19.294
[metal scraping]

16:24.233 --> 16:25.433
[distant sea gulls cry]

16:25.501 --> 16:27.736
- What's up, doc?

16:29.372 --> 16:30.906
Oh, is that just your thing?

16:30.973 --> 16:34.075
I don't want to step
on any toes.

16:37.647 --> 16:40.482
[smooth jazz music playing]

16:41.884 --> 16:45.120
- Smooth jazz.
I know it's your favorite.

16:45.187 --> 16:47.122
- Do you mind?

16:47.189 --> 16:50.158
- You done with that page?

16:50.226 --> 16:52.093
Just let me know
when you're done.

16:52.161 --> 16:54.396
I'll flip it
when you're done.

16:54.463 --> 16:57.232
Done yet?
Done yet?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.400
Done yet?

16:58.467 --> 17:00.135
Aah!
[music stops]

17:01.771 --> 17:04.005
- I'll save your place!

17:06.175 --> 17:08.209
- Whoo-hoo!

17:11.146 --> 17:12.579
- Carrot?

17:12.647 --> 17:15.717
I know they're your favorite!
[grunts]

17:18.521 --> 17:19.954
[toots]
- aah!

17:20.021 --> 17:23.124
- Happy 189 days
until your birthday!

17:23.192 --> 17:25.160
[toots]

17:25.227 --> 17:28.496
- I just saw my life flash
before my eyes.

17:28.564 --> 17:30.265
- Ooh!
Tell me all about it.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.167
This time,
I promise I'll listen.

17:32.234 --> 17:34.169
- Daffy,
you got to back off.

17:34.236 --> 17:36.338
- Sure thing.
This good?

17:36.405 --> 17:37.772
- More.
- This good?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.107
- More.
- This good?

17:39.175 --> 17:41.676
Whoa!
[banging]

17:41.744 --> 17:44.512
[crashes]
- yeah. That's good.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.120
- Is everyone enjoying
the cruise?

17:52.188 --> 17:54.289
- Oh, indeed!
It's our first one.

17:54.357 --> 17:56.958
- And I must say,
I'm a fan of cruising.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.194
- Oh, yes.
We're cruisers now.

17:59.261 --> 18:01.863
[metal groans]

18:01.931 --> 18:05.033
- Excuse me. Excuse me
pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.

18:05.101 --> 18:07.268
[metal groaning
and dishes clanking]

18:07.336 --> 18:10.372
- I wasn't sure what you wanted,
so I brought you everything.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.273
- [giggles]

18:12.341 --> 18:16.277
- Get your own buffet.
This one's for my best friend.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.947
- [crying]

18:19.015 --> 18:21.583
- Daffy,
you're embarrassing me.

18:21.650 --> 18:23.184
[clinks]

18:23.252 --> 18:25.420
- I'd like
to propose a toast

18:25.488 --> 18:28.423
To the most important person
on this ship.

18:28.491 --> 18:31.192
Sit down,
you glorified bus driver.

18:31.260 --> 18:32.861
Ahem. Ahem.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.863
A rat once told me

18:34.930 --> 18:37.332
That friendship takes
a lot of effort,

18:37.400 --> 18:40.101
But I'm not interested
in friendship.

18:40.169 --> 18:43.905
I'm interested
in best friendship.

18:43.973 --> 18:49.010
And best friendship takes
a whole lot more.

18:49.078 --> 18:52.680
It means waiting on
your best friend hand and foot,

18:52.748 --> 18:54.916
Buying their affection.

18:54.984 --> 18:59.020
Robotically memorizing
every trivial little fact
about them.

18:59.088 --> 19:01.189
- It means support them
above all others.

19:01.257 --> 19:03.091
- Possibly to the detriment
of those others.

19:03.159 --> 19:05.860
- Especially to the detriment
of those others.

19:05.928 --> 19:08.363
- Best friends have
all of the same interests...

19:08.431 --> 19:10.298
- Whether those interests are
interesting or not.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.568
- A best friend is
someone you'd happily
commit a crime for.

19:13.636 --> 19:16.337
- Any crime!
- No matter how heinous!

19:16.405 --> 19:18.873
- The heinouser,
the betterer.

19:18.941 --> 19:23.511
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not a best friend.
That's a stalker.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.748
Daffy, I know I said
you weren't my best friend,

19:26.816 --> 19:28.683
But after
these past few days,

19:28.751 --> 19:31.019
Seeing all the effort
you've put in,

19:31.087 --> 19:33.855
Seeing how hard
you've tried,
I have to say...

19:33.923 --> 19:36.591
You got to stop trying.
- What?

19:36.659 --> 19:38.193
- It's not your thing.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.463
Would it be nice
if you remembered
the occasional birthday

19:41.530 --> 19:44.432
Or food I'm highly allergic to?
Sure.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.102
But not if it means
we turn into those guys.

19:47.169 --> 19:49.604
- No offense.
Both: None taken.

19:49.672 --> 19:53.208
- Daffy, you're a mean spirited,
self-absorbed,

19:53.275 --> 19:54.809
Disturbed little weirdo.

19:54.877 --> 19:57.645
But for whatever reason,
you're my best friend.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.647
- Ooh!
[applause]

19:59.715 --> 20:01.249
[murmuring]

20:01.317 --> 20:05.653
- You're my best friend, too,
bugs bada-blingya.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.056
- Ehh. Good enough.

20:13.662 --> 20:16.331
[foghorn]
[sea gulls crying]

20:16.398 --> 20:19.100
- Seriously,
how did you pay
for all this?

20:19.168 --> 20:23.004
