WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.926
[indistinct office chatter]

00:10.010 --> 00:12.387
[officer] Narcotics,
Officer O'Lansky speaking.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.310
I don't know. Dark shit.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.479
I'm just up in my head, you know?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.772
[man] Uh-huh.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.524
When's the last time you hit a meeting?

00:25.025 --> 00:28.319
Okay. Six days I'm here, 14, 15 hours,

00:28.403 --> 00:29.696
Sundays I sleep.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.073
Last week I solved two murders, got three.

00:32.157 --> 00:32.991
Do the math.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.536
-Plus I fucking hate meetings.
-The whole point, Mel.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.538
You know what they say
about contrary action?

00:38.621 --> 00:40.582
Oh, come on. Don't start that.

00:40.665 --> 00:44.461
People like us, if we just do the opposite
of what we feel like doing,

00:44.544 --> 00:46.838
it all comes out fine.
I wish it was different.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.256
The fuck is the point of life

00:48.339 --> 00:50.341
if everything you want to do
is bad for you?

00:50.425 --> 00:53.720
$10,000 question. When's the last time
you wrote a gratitude list?

00:53.803 --> 00:55.930
I don't know
the last time I felt grateful.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.309
I wonder, why is it alcoholics, as a race,

00:59.392 --> 01:01.895
are people who want to be paid for a gift?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.440
So, I want to run something by you.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.775
Yeah?

01:10.528 --> 01:12.906
Thought I might give my cat
to this chick I know.

01:12.989 --> 01:13.948
[man] Mm-hmm.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.076
Sell all my shit, right?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.661
-Uh-huh.
-Buy a big pile of crack,

01:20.163 --> 01:21.331
pull down the shades,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.416
and smoke it till I die.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.961
Okay, let's play that out.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.464
-You sell all your shit, right?
-[snorting lines]

01:29.547 --> 01:32.383
You buy that big pile of crack
and pull down the shades,

01:32.967 --> 01:35.011
you'll smoke it all and you won't die.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.638
And then where will you be?

01:39.724 --> 01:40.725
[sighs] Fuck.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.354
[man on phone] Mel, you there?

01:45.313 --> 01:46.147
Mel.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.233
Mel, you there?

01:56.866 --> 01:58.201
[student coughs]

02:43.621 --> 02:45.248
This is not the deal we made.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.042
We told you, this is a temporary solution.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.462
We need poppy gum,
this is powdered heroin,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.715
which means it's probably not pure enough,

02:53.798 --> 02:56.342
and if it's not, I don't know
how many people I'll have to pay off

02:56.426 --> 02:58.511
to keep this whole situation under wraps.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.680
Do not worry, it's pure.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.558
Who exactly is this person?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.186
Someone we've worked with quite a bit.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.355
For a philanthropist,
you sure know a lot of drug dealers.

03:11.065 --> 03:14.861
Navarro has agreed to supply us
as soon as Javi's concerns are alleviated.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.239
Your friend Javi cost me
a week on my production calendar.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.993
I made projections.
Pharmacies expect delivery October 1st,

03:22.076 --> 03:24.078
and if I miss one single day,

03:24.162 --> 03:26.831
shareholders rebel, stock price plummets

03:26.915 --> 03:28.666
and I'm filing for fucking bankruptcy.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.544
What is she, 16?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.464
Don't let the looks fool you.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.216
You must be Clare.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.384
Ruth Langmore.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.761
How are ya?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.850
You got a sample?
Somewhere I can check it?

03:46.726 --> 03:47.560
Bathroom.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.646
[pulsing rhythm builds]

04:06.704 --> 04:09.165
So, how do you like the Ozarks so far?

04:11.542 --> 04:13.336
[Clare and Ruth chuckle]

04:22.762 --> 04:26.641
[fluid sloshing]

04:43.658 --> 04:44.534
We got a deal?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.037
[bell ringing]

05:05.138 --> 05:07.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck do you want?

05:08.558 --> 05:11.311
I watched you
when your dad pulled out of our deal.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.730
You didn't like it any better than I did.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.274
Tell me I'm wrong, I'll go.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.028
I don't discuss my family with outsiders.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.823
You're an outsider in your own family.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.785
Your old man gave you a living,
then he took it away.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.620
Like you care.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.873
Yeah, I don't, you're right.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.458
I shot off your dick.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.502
[Darlene sighs]

05:36.586 --> 05:38.421
For that, I apologize.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.300
Even went to the drugstore
to look for a card.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.969
No such card exists.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.347
What the fuck do you want, Darlene?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.808
I want you to accept my apology.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.435
No.

05:53.019 --> 05:53.853
Hmm.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.065
Anyway, I heard the doc did real good.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.986
They say that there's
more of you to love now.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.036
I got a slew of that. It's ready to move.

06:11.913 --> 06:12.747
When?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.665
As soon as you want.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.918
And mark it up a grand a key.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.712
[chuckles] Mark it up three.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.005
It's up to you.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.466
I'm giving you your living back.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.094
-Why?
-Why not?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.392
I can see I got your heart beatin' again.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.521
Oh.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.773
Don't give Daddy a taste.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.110
You got six figures in your pocket.
Seven if you're smart.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.529
And I have heard you are smart.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.531
From who?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.784
[Darlene snickering]

06:58.292 --> 06:59.419
[phone chimes]

07:04.173 --> 07:06.300
Senator Schafer wants
to sit down tomorrow.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.013
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

07:11.097 --> 07:12.557
It's good. I think.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.975
I mean, he's coming here.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.686
At least it means
he's considering joining our board.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.357
What are you doing?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.068
What did you expect, Wendy?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.531
There's another one.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.496
So, anyone happen
to go through town today?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.665
In the car?

07:38.875 --> 07:39.876
On their bike?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.589
What exactly were you trying to achieve?

07:44.672 --> 07:47.675
-Wendy, let's just try to enjoy the meal.
-No, no, no. I really-- I wanna…

07:47.758 --> 07:50.094
I'd really like
to hear from Jonah on this.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.846
Were you trying to hurt us?

07:52.763 --> 07:53.806
Put us at risk?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.227
I didn't have them put up.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.062
All right? Darlene did.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.694
Darlene.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.244
Maybe it's a good thing.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.164
Why is that?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.084
Shows we care.

08:26.923 --> 08:27.757
Um…

08:28.883 --> 08:29.759
Charlotte.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.261
How were the SATs? Hmm?

08:34.805 --> 08:35.681
What?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.643
I left in the middle.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.562
Why'd you leave in the middle?

08:41.646 --> 08:44.565
Well, what's the point
if I'm not going to college?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.152
Huh? You knew about this?

08:49.195 --> 08:52.365
She's turning 18 in a couple of months.
She can make her own decisions.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.036
Let me talk to you in the bedroom
for a second, please.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.473
Not everybody goes to college.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.227
What? Can you shut the door, please?

09:21.727 --> 09:22.728
Please. Thank you.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.398
You know, we… we sent
her to prep school, Wendy. So--

09:25.481 --> 09:27.191
Yeah. In Chicago.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.653
Uh-huh. So have you
ever heard of a unified front?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.822
'Cause it's parenting 101.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.032
Charlotte's not like other kids.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.617
Her life is different.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.037
-Is that a good thing?
-It is what it is.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.748
And since when did you
become so collaborative, huh?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.375
I don't recall you asking me about

09:44.458 --> 09:47.295
doing a mammoth
pharmaceutical drug deal with Ruth.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.923
Which is saving our asses,
and you would have just said no.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.134
Which is why
I didn't tell you about Charlotte.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.511
Oh please, just stop. It's not the same.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.679
And for the record,

09:57.471 --> 09:59.640
your brother is not missing, okay?

09:59.724 --> 10:00.641
He's dead.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.644
And it might make you
feel better to pretend otherwise,

10:03.728 --> 10:05.855
but this is one problem that, it won't--

10:07.898 --> 10:10.109
[sighing heavily] You know…

10:11.319 --> 10:13.571
It's not just gonna walk away, Wendy.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.739
[doorknob jiggling]

10:15.698 --> 10:16.657
[door closes]

10:18.784 --> 10:20.786
[bugs chirring]

10:39.805 --> 10:40.890
[knocking on door]

10:40.973 --> 10:41.974
You got a sec?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.268
[Charlotte] Can we please
not talk about college?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.937
Uh… yeah. Promise.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.481
Um…

10:50.274 --> 10:52.318
When's the last time you talked to Wyatt?

10:53.319 --> 10:56.489
Oh God. Um, not since
he dropped off the face of the earth.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.534
Mm-hmm. Um… Uh, I know that this is, uh…

11:01.285 --> 11:04.163
Um, I know. I'm sorry, but, uh…

11:04.246 --> 11:05.831
Do you think you can talk to him

11:05.915 --> 11:08.501
and see if he can press Darlene
to take that stuff down?

11:08.584 --> 11:10.586
I… I know that it's a lot to ask, but--

11:10.670 --> 11:12.171
Does Mom know you're doing this?

11:13.089 --> 11:16.634
Uh… not at the moment. No.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.260
Um…

11:20.137 --> 11:22.348
-Okay? Yeah?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.225
Good. Thank you.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.143
Don't stay up too late.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.064
[birds calling]

11:34.985 --> 11:36.487
Is there any more coffee left there?

11:36.570 --> 11:37.988
-Yeah.
-Please? Thank you.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.741
What time do you meet with Schafer?

11:40.825 --> 11:41.867
-Morning.
-Nine.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.957
-Thank you.
-When do you meet with Ruth?

11:48.457 --> 11:49.500
Uh, same, nine.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.502
[knocking on door]

12:00.761 --> 12:02.012
[Mel] Sorry to interrupt.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.266
-Anything at all from Helen Pierce?
-No. Sorry.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.601
[sighs]

12:07.685 --> 12:09.145
[tsks] Um…

12:09.228 --> 12:11.564
Just-- just to clear it up,
uh, I'm not a cop.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.858
I don't prosecute people.
I'm looking for a signature,

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
that's all, then I'd be outta your life.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.362
-Okay. We're really rushing this morning.
-I'll get to it, then.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.197
We haven't seen Helen in over a month.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.866
Is that because she's dead?

12:22.533 --> 12:23.367
What's that?

12:24.285 --> 12:25.745
I'm gonna tell you what I think.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.249
I think your brother Ben killed her
and now you're protecting him.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.334
Why would you think that?

12:32.960 --> 12:36.130
I mean, look, she gets him
tossed in the bin and he gets out,

12:36.213 --> 12:37.423
none too pleased, I bet.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.217
You know, he's prone
to flying off the handle, and now…

12:40.301 --> 12:41.594
she's missing, and…

12:42.470 --> 12:46.474
Well, so is he. And in police parlance,
that's what we call an Ellie.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.310
As in LE, it's a likely explanation.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.979
I got to tell you, I'm really losing
my patience with all this.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.148
[Mel] You got it all wrong.
Look, I just want Helen.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.150
Body is as good as a signature, so…

12:58.569 --> 13:00.529
Look, if I was to get an anonymous tip,

13:00.613 --> 13:03.699
I'd be all ears and no mouth
and out of your life forever.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.286
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.747
All right. I should probably tell you,

13:09.830 --> 13:11.916
I just got back from, uh, North Carolina.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.335
I spoke to Nathan Davis,
that's your dad, right?

13:14.418 --> 13:18.964
Now, he said he thinks that maybe, uh,
Ben went down to Knoxville, Tennessee.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.508
He's got some people down there.

13:21.008 --> 13:21.926
So, uh…

13:23.594 --> 13:26.680
I dunno, you ever get any kind
of postcard from Knoxville, Tennessee?

13:27.681 --> 13:28.849
I need to get to work.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.893
[Marty] Sorry we weren't able to help.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.145
Got one.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.358
You know, I got, like,
500 in a box in the car, so…

13:40.402 --> 13:41.904
-Have a great day.
-You too.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.157
I hate him so much.

13:45.783 --> 13:46.826
[Wendy] Yup!

13:52.373 --> 13:54.792
[Wendy] So, Senator,
how can we be of service?

13:55.376 --> 13:59.380
Your foundation deals with the FBI
on corruption cases, am I right?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.339
That's right.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.217
I got a bit of a family situation.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.471
Um, the federal wire-fraud net

14:07.555 --> 14:10.766
over Illinois, and Wisconsin, Minnesota.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.395
My son might have gotten
tangled up in a corner of that.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.437
Needlessly.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.107
-Your son, the federal judge?
-[grunts]

14:18.190 --> 14:21.068
Well, his son, my grandson, Liam.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.153
He's an extraordinary kid.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.614
He just started a company.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.868
They build voting machines
with some proprietary tech,

14:28.951 --> 14:31.370
and some people maybe found out about it

14:31.453 --> 14:34.081
in advance of the stock offering

14:34.164 --> 14:36.083
and made a profit, and…

14:36.625 --> 14:38.085
one of them being my son.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.212
The federal judge.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.590
[Schafer] Yeah, well,
it's a gray area at best.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.926
I mean, obviously a father's
going to want to invest in his son,

14:46.010 --> 14:48.178
it doesn't make it insider-trading.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.348
And you want us
to explain that to the SEC?

14:51.932 --> 14:55.311
I'm not asking you
to advocate on my behalf,

14:55.394 --> 14:57.897
it's nothing like that. No. I, uh…

15:00.816 --> 15:03.736
I just need to see that file.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.947
If my son is a target
of this investigation,

15:07.448 --> 15:10.868
he's gonna want to get out front of it
as privately as possible,

15:10.951 --> 15:11.911
and if he's not,

15:11.994 --> 15:15.623
he's happy to not preemptively
draw attention to himself.

15:16.206 --> 15:19.168
This wouldn't have anything to do
with your sitting on our board?

15:19.251 --> 15:21.962
You know, it's hard
to think about sitting anywhere

15:22.046 --> 15:24.506
with this hanging over my family,

15:24.590 --> 15:27.509
but, uh, if I knew what the feds know, I…

15:27.593 --> 15:30.262
I'd certainly feel more comfortable.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.139
I'll see what I can do.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.855
-Thank you for your time.
-Always a pleasure.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.856
Senator.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.071
[chuckles]

15:47.154 --> 15:48.739
I'll have Marty call Agent Miller.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.866
Oh, and…

15:52.910 --> 15:54.912
this guy's been snooping around.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.747
I'd love anything you can find on him.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.208
Okay.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.293
[birds tweeting]

16:04.755 --> 16:06.131
[dog barking in distance]

16:06.215 --> 16:08.133
[livestock bleating]

16:14.348 --> 16:17.017
Hey! There was a load here
bricked up, where is it?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.645
[sighs] Ms. Snell had
it loaded out this morning.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.563
Loaded out where?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.731
I dunno.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.448
[Darlene] It's gone. Why?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.201
[Ruth] I had an idea
how to move it, is all.

16:34.743 --> 16:39.289
Well, I sold it to Frank Jr.
just a few hours ago.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.126
How the fuck did you manage that?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.628
Turning on the charm, I guess.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.297
You shot his fucking dick off, Darlene.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.091
I got a lot of charm.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.260
No, thanks.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.095
What, you front him?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.347
No, paid in full.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.142
Oh, and you were gonna tell me when?

16:58.642 --> 17:02.312
[scoffs] When I saw you!
And I'm seeing you now.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.440
What were you gonna do with it anyway?

17:05.399 --> 17:07.317
That's fucking moot now, isn't it?

17:13.782 --> 17:14.783
[door shuts]

17:15.659 --> 17:17.453
[phone ringing]

17:17.536 --> 17:18.787
[Marty sighs]

17:18.871 --> 17:20.831
-Is that her?
-[Marty] It is not, no.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.876
She has five more minutes
and then I blow up.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.085
-Hi.
-[Wendy] Hey.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.712
We need Maya to pull us a file

17:26.795 --> 17:30.049
on a wire-fraud sting from Illinois,
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.426
It's important.
You need to go to Jeff City.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.679
Well, I-- I cannot right now,
I'm in the middle of a drug deal

17:35.763 --> 17:37.347
and Ruth is 25 minutes late.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.516
[Wendy] We don't get Schafer without it.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.853
Can you call Maya,
have her put the file aside for us?

17:42.936 --> 17:45.814
Tell her-- Tell her I'll pick it up.
Tell her I'm in Jeff City anyway.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.608
Can you do that? Now?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.818
Uh, yes, soon. Bye.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.154
Marty, can I talk to you for a sec?

17:52.237 --> 17:54.531
-Okay.
-No, no, no. No sidebars.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.201
We have a little problem.
Somebody else fucking took it.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.368
Our heroin?

17:58.452 --> 17:59.328
Took it?

17:59.411 --> 18:00.287
Bought it.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.914
You sold our heroin?

18:01.997 --> 18:03.582
I didn't fucking sell it. No.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.084
[Marty] Wait. Who bought it?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.336
Frank Jr.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.796
Who?

18:08.879 --> 18:12.591
That's, uh… it's Kansas City Mob.
It's… it's okay. I'll… I'll call him.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.718
How many fucking heroin dealers
do you people know?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.553
Um, just the three.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.640
[Clara] Well, I have half a mind
to go back to the Tasmanians.

18:19.723 --> 18:23.060
Well, you'll pay four times the amount.
Don't worry about it. I got this handled.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.603
-If it's cut, it's ruined.
-Yeah.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.271
-You understand that?
-I do. Yep.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.356
Fix this.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.440
I am on it.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.317
Okay? Promise.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.278
-Um…
-Because without these drugs,

18:34.154 --> 18:35.405
there's no money for you.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.407
There's no Rick Bowlsby

18:37.491 --> 18:39.868
or John Pittman or Ed Markham.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.080
Which means your fucking
charitable foundation is dead.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.706
We clear?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.624
Yes.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.793
[Clara] If you bring down
my family's company,

18:47.876 --> 18:49.753
I will drag you the fuck down with us.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.182
So you're gonna call Frank Jr. right now.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.018
Hey, easy, Marty.
I don't work for you no more.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.771
And just 'cause you let that cunt
get her fist up your ass

19:07.855 --> 19:10.232
does not mean you can get yours up mine.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.316
Are we clear?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.236
Yeah.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.280
And I did call Frank.

19:16.363 --> 19:19.199
He offloaded the shit to two other guys
who already paid him.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.244
Hang on a second.
There's two separate buyers?

19:22.327 --> 19:25.622
-Are you kidding me, Ruth?
-I told you this was tricky!

19:25.706 --> 19:28.208
I had concerns which I expressed,

19:28.292 --> 19:31.628
and you… you begged me
and here we fucking are!

19:31.712 --> 19:34.882
Okay. You're gonna call him,
tell him I'll sweeten the deal.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.925
Tell him I'll give him an extra $100,000

19:37.009 --> 19:39.970
and an extra hundred grand
for both the other buyers, okay?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.556
And a hundred grand for me.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.309
What's that?

19:45.392 --> 19:49.771
I said, and a hundred grand for me.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.190
I heard what you said.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.109
Then fucking say it.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.488
Hundred grand for you.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.166
[soft lullaby twinkling]

20:14.630 --> 20:15.589
He's beautiful.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.676
It only took me
45 minutes to get him down.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.888
Don't worry, it gets easier.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.432
-Everybody says that.
-Mmm.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.851
I wish I believed it. [scoffs]

20:31.146 --> 20:33.148
What brings you to Jeff City anyway?

20:34.566 --> 20:35.776
Meeting at the capitol.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.778
With who?

20:38.654 --> 20:39.738
[Wendy scoffs]

20:43.325 --> 20:45.953
You like being a big fish in a small pond.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.582
I like draining one swamp at a time.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.543
-Right.
-Mmm.

20:54.878 --> 20:58.382
So where's the FBI stand
on Navarro these days?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.134
They're happy with the seizures.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.805
The key to me is whether or not
he'll agree to do real time.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.099
[Wendy] Hmm.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.353
Over a hundred cases of wire-fraud here.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.647
-Marty's a hero if he can crack it.
-Hmm.

21:14.314 --> 21:18.944
And tell him if he doesn't
want to work for free or part-time,

21:19.569 --> 21:20.904
I'll get him a badge.

21:23.907 --> 21:24.783
I'll tell him.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.914
-He'd be great at it, you know.
-Oh, I know.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.165
Thank you for the file.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.061
[phone chimes]

22:04.781 --> 22:07.409
Hey, I'm gonna go, uh…
go grab a bite to eat.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.577
Do you want anything?

22:11.288 --> 22:12.164
Custard.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.760
-Enjoy!
-Thanks.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.220
Hey!

22:27.888 --> 22:28.722
Hey!

22:30.432 --> 22:31.391
Sure.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.352
How are you?

22:34.102 --> 22:36.646
Uh, yeah, pretty good, I guess. Uh…

22:37.564 --> 22:39.107
Yeah, happy. Uh…

22:41.610 --> 22:43.195
Yeah, life is, uh…

22:45.614 --> 22:46.698
Life is funny.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.825
[both chuckling]

22:50.786 --> 22:51.661
You look good.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.497
Oh. You too.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.835
Look, I'm sorry for kind of, uh…

22:58.919 --> 23:01.421
-ghosting you a while ago, I--
-No, it's okay.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.217
-I had a lot going on.
-I know.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.095
You don't have to apologize, it's…

23:09.638 --> 23:13.100
I know that our family messed up
a lot of stuff and I'm sorry about that.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.356
Look, I know that Darlene hates us

23:19.439 --> 23:22.609
and I-- I… I don't want
to get into all that right now.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.612
But I have a favor to ask.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.115
Kind of a big one.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.294
Do you miss it, Ruth?

23:42.462 --> 23:45.590
If you mean do I miss you asking me
to come help move a couch,

23:45.674 --> 23:48.427
then when I show up, you want me
to move all the shit in your house?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.429
I don't miss that. No.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.640
Um…

23:54.683 --> 23:55.642
So…

23:57.853 --> 23:58.895
How's Jonah doing?

23:58.979 --> 24:00.230
-Good!
-Yeah?

24:00.313 --> 24:01.481
Real good, actually.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.483
If he's this good at 14,

24:03.567 --> 24:05.110
by the time he's old like you,

24:05.193 --> 24:07.237
he'll be leaving your ass
in the fucking dirt.

24:08.530 --> 24:12.701
[sighs] Well, just-- Just keep
an eye on him for me, okay?

24:13.410 --> 24:14.244
Please.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.624
[ominous music plays]

24:35.682 --> 24:39.311
[ominous music building]

24:44.024 --> 24:46.485
[tires screeching]

24:47.652 --> 24:49.112
[horn blaring]

24:52.073 --> 24:54.075
[Guerrero] Sure am glad you're doing this.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.203
Already got some calls.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.954
Calls?

24:58.038 --> 25:00.248
Tips and possible sightings.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.087
So, we file it two-pronged,

25:06.713 --> 25:08.006
state and federal.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.302
State is me, federal is
the National Crime Information Center.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.388
They pass it along to the other 49 states,

25:15.931 --> 25:18.475
and can even go foreign, if need be.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.771
That sounds incredibly thorough.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.564
Thank you, thank you so much.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.739
I wonder why you didn't do it sooner.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.200
Well…

25:38.620 --> 25:40.455
[voice braking] It was a family issue

25:40.539 --> 25:43.875
and we didn't want to waste
the department resources, and--

25:43.959 --> 25:45.293
But now I just…

25:48.547 --> 25:49.923
[sniffling]

25:51.550 --> 25:53.051
I just miss him so much.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.722
-Uh-huh.
-[sniffling]

25:58.431 --> 26:01.184
Well, let's find your brother.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.687
[sniffs, chuckles]

26:29.170 --> 26:30.046
Darlene.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.548
It's Wendy.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.550
I'm just…

26:35.302 --> 26:37.262
I'm just calling to express my gratitude.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.265
Jonah told us how you took the trouble

26:40.348 --> 26:42.934
to put those posters
and those billboards all over town.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.270
This is gonna be
such a big help to my family

26:45.353 --> 26:47.063
and you let me know if I can chip in.

26:47.147 --> 26:51.109
Oh, and also I just filed a missing
persons report over at the sheriff's, so…

26:53.570 --> 26:54.571
fingers crossed.

26:59.659 --> 27:00.493
Darlene?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.080
I'm happy to oblige.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.208
[line disconnects]

27:11.463 --> 27:13.465
[tense music playing]

27:21.848 --> 27:23.975
[air brakes squeal, hiss]

27:53.755 --> 27:56.424
-[door creaking]
-[footsteps approaching]

28:09.521 --> 28:10.480
Here for a room?

28:10.563 --> 28:13.066
Yeah, I, uh, called ahead. Name's Sattem.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.365
Well, well.
Got a lanai room all ready for you.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.576
Excuse me?

28:23.660 --> 28:24.786
Oh, poolside.

28:28.039 --> 28:28.957
Here you go.

28:29.624 --> 28:30.500
There's no minibar,

28:30.583 --> 28:33.545
but you got a junior fridge
and there's a Quick Pick on the corner

28:33.628 --> 28:35.296
if you need some beer and wine, so…

28:35.380 --> 28:36.506
Actually, I don't drink.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.217
So maybe you wouldn't mind
removing the fridge altogether?

28:40.301 --> 28:42.220
Um… sure thing.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.682
Do you mind my asking
how you heard about the Lazy-O?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.684
Was it, like, social media, word-of-mouth?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.561
Jonah Byrde work here?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.312
Oh, you're a friend of Jonah's?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.273
A friend of the family.

28:53.982 --> 28:54.983
Uh, what…

28:55.900 --> 28:58.653
What does he do here, anyway?
Like, maintenance or something?

28:58.737 --> 29:01.030
Oh, no, no. Jonah handles our finances.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.075
Did you need to talk to him?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.705
No. Uh…

29:10.457 --> 29:11.332
Not now.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.378
Okay. Well, enjoy your stay.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.090
[race car engines buzzing]

29:19.174 --> 29:21.843
[car approaching]

29:27.474 --> 29:28.975
[Ruth] Is this our second guy?

29:40.945 --> 29:42.197
[tires screeching]

29:47.243 --> 29:49.204
[Frank Jr] What the fuck's going on, John?

29:49.287 --> 29:51.539
[John] My guys don't like this
and I don't either, so no.

29:51.623 --> 29:55.418
John. They're throwing in another
hundred grand for your trouble.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.671
I fucking buy from you,
then you want to buy it back?

29:59.506 --> 30:00.423
I don't like it.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.010
Look, John. They fucked up is all.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.221
They want it back
and they're willing to pay extra.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.056
And then my guys pull up

30:08.139 --> 30:11.309
and you're sitting with a cop,
a marine and a fucking flag girl?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.728
Be smart here, John.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.147
I like the deal I got.

30:16.856 --> 30:17.732
We're done.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.150
[line disconnects]

30:23.196 --> 30:24.989
[Frank Jr] I can't be going there.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.075
Fine, then give me the fucking address.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.910
It's the least you can do for me.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.495
You don't want to go in either.

30:31.037 --> 30:34.415
I don't fucking want to, I have to.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.919
Why don't you tell Marty to fuck himself?
Got half his drugs.

30:38.002 --> 30:42.090
No, he's paying me another hundred grand,
and I mean to fucking collect it.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.387
You better make sure that fucking
marine fuck doesn't go in blazing.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.765
He shoots a gun that blows back on me
with my dad, I swear to God.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.397
Don't worry.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.275
It'll all be good.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.906
You know, I shouldn't have
roughed you up like that.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.409
I'm sorry.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.247
It chaps you they didn't kill me, I bet.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.796
[scoffs]

31:26.801 --> 31:29.137
I probably should've
never threw you off that boat.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.440
We're on.

31:43.902 --> 31:44.986
[Wendy] How's it going?

31:45.069 --> 31:48.072
Uh, we… we hit a glitch.
I'm gonna miss dinner, probably.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.490
Can you talk?

31:50.283 --> 31:51.659
Not really, no.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.495
I gave Schafer the file,
he seemed pleased.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.372
So he's good?

31:56.456 --> 31:59.417
I have a meeting with him later with Jim.
And I got word on Mel.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.793
Oh yeah? What's the story?

32:01.377 --> 32:03.588
Former detective, Chicago PD.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.340
He lost his badge.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.551
A little coke problem
that ended in the evidence room.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.888
[Marty] Was he good at his job?

32:13.181 --> 32:15.183
[Wendy] Apparently he was very good at it.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.145
Workaholic, relentless.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.191
[Marty] Oh, that's not good.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.233
[Wendy] No.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.071
Am I too late
for two jars of Apple Blossom?

32:28.154 --> 32:29.364
[Wyatt] Oh. Um…

32:30.573 --> 32:32.158
You ever try the Ginger Bear?

32:32.241 --> 32:33.076
Is it good?

32:33.576 --> 32:34.410
Next time.

32:36.162 --> 32:36.996
Thank you.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.589
[bicycle gear clicking]

32:49.884 --> 32:51.636
I have some checks for you to sign.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.806
What did you tell your mother
about those signs?

32:57.016 --> 32:58.142
What? Nothing.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.106
She thought-- She thought I put them up.
I just told her that I didn't.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.774
And that I did.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.026
I didn't know it was a secret.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.113
Just like you told her
we're gonna build those rehabs.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.322
But I didn't do that.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.992
What else are you telling
your mommy and daddy about me?

33:16.285 --> 33:17.203
Nothing.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.663
Nothing. I swear.

33:20.248 --> 33:24.127
Now, I'm gonna tell you real clear
so I never have to again.

33:25.169 --> 33:30.758
You don't ever tell anybody anything
about what we're doing.

33:30.842 --> 33:31.926
Do you understand me?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.804
-Darlene, take it easy. It's just a kid--
-Don't interrupt me!

33:34.887 --> 33:36.389
Do you understand me?

33:37.015 --> 33:40.518
Because I could cut a lot more
than just your hair, boy.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.645
Sorry.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.397
Well "sorry" don't pay my bills.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.858
What I need is loyalty.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.360
-Are you loyal?
-Of course.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.239
Then you could tell me
something about your parents,

33:53.322 --> 33:55.658
like what they did to my sheriff.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.953
I know you know.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.540
And you do not want to see me

34:02.623 --> 34:04.709
if I think you're hiding
something from me.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.715
They got rid of his body
at the crematorium.

34:10.798 --> 34:12.258
That's all I know. I swear.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.597
Okay.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.349
Give me the checks.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.688
[bugs chirring]

34:50.630 --> 34:54.258
Bet your ass it's a house
with side buildings and cameras.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.804
ATVs out front
and a fucking boat on a trailer.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.847
I've breached compounds like this before.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.974
Like what? You can't see shit.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.352
Trust me. I'm in, three shots, I'm out.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.896
Hey, we're not killing people, okay?
We're making a deal.

35:06.979 --> 35:09.232
And you wouldn't even know
where the drugs are anyway.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.025
They just bought them. They'll be in view.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.986
And we're not stealing anything,
we're paying for them.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.656
-[Ruth] So I'll go in.
-No, you won't.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.535
Are you gonna go in, Marty?

35:20.618 --> 35:23.788
Or Mr. Fucking Tight Ass Special Ops here?

35:23.871 --> 35:26.249
'Cause if you're not going in
and he's not going in,

35:26.332 --> 35:29.168
-then who the fuck's gonna go in?
-I said, no. Okay?

35:30.336 --> 35:32.463
Are you paying me
that hundred grand or what?

35:36.050 --> 35:36.926
I am.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.346
So then I'm fucking going in.

35:49.939 --> 35:50.773
[man] Stop.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.067
Drop the bags.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.658
We just want to make a deal, okay,

36:01.534 --> 36:03.035
over and above what you paid.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.079
We're not fucking cops,

36:05.580 --> 36:06.581
and we got cash.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.167
I want to see your boss.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.335
[man] Who you with?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.255
The same guys from the speedway.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.716
[man] Where they at?

36:17.508 --> 36:18.885
Bottom of the driveway.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.138
[man] Back away from the bags.

36:26.934 --> 36:27.935
Check her out.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.243
She's clean.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.078
Go.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.708
[Clare] You know the product
can't be cut with any impurities.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.336
I'm worried about time.
We might need to get aggressive.

36:53.961 --> 36:57.590
[Marty] No. No, we can't do that, buddy.
You're gonna get her killed.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.219
-When you say aggressive--
-Yeah, I mean potential casualties.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.930
[Marty] Hey, can you--
can you put her on speaker, guy?

37:04.013 --> 37:06.807
-Can you put her on the speaker, please?
-You authorize me to go in?

37:06.891 --> 37:09.018
Hey, Clare, I want to talk to you.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.686
Put her on speaker, please. Clare!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.230
Put him on.

37:13.981 --> 37:14.982
Thank you.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.985
Hey, um, uh, you know,

37:18.069 --> 37:19.779
these are-- these are Ruth's people.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.114
I just, I-- Give her
five more minutes, please.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.950
That's all I'm asking. Five minutes.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.702
Five minutes. Then call me.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.912
Okay, thank you.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.498
Thank you.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.180
[breathing heavily]

37:54.480 --> 37:57.900
Let's say I believe you're not a cop,
which I don't. Then what?

37:58.442 --> 37:59.694
You tell me.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.612
Leave the money,
I'll call you in the morning.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.114
[scoffs] No fucking way.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.616
You'll leave the money dead or alive,
may as well be alive.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.827
I ain't leaving here without the drugs.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.287
Well, you have a problem then.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.372
They were never supposed
to go to you anyway.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.707
Easy, Blondie.

38:13.249 --> 38:16.711
Look, I work for Omar Navarro,

38:16.794 --> 38:17.753
you know who that is?

38:17.837 --> 38:20.172
You work for Omar Navarro,
why you need drugs?

38:20.256 --> 38:21.799
I need them back.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.218
They're for the guy I'm with.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.178
Which one? The cop or the marine.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.805
-The marine.
-Who is he?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.349
-His name's Connor.
-Connor who?

38:30.433 --> 38:32.143
I don't fucking know.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.644
Connor with cash.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.271
What the fuck do you care?

38:36.439 --> 38:37.815
-[blow lands]
-[Ruth grunts]

38:38.941 --> 38:40.276
I care a lot.

38:43.195 --> 38:46.490
[stammering] The-- The guy…

38:46.991 --> 38:50.036
The guy who you… who you think's the cop,

38:50.119 --> 38:51.996
him and Navarro are partners.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.165
That sounds like a lot of talk.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.959
Okay, I get it, I get it,
you're-- you're spooked.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.879
But the problem with you being spooked
is about to cost you 100 grand.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.881
Hey, bitch.

39:01.964 --> 39:04.800
Stop telling me how to run
my fucking business!

39:12.600 --> 39:14.852
It's been six minutes,
you authorize me to go in?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.481
Seven.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.940
[Clare] I don't know what to do.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.027
Your dad would say, go with your gut.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.028
[scoffs]

39:26.864 --> 39:28.783
-Okay.
-"Okay" meaning, go in?

39:30.910 --> 39:32.912
-You're not going in there.
-I'll call you back.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.830
You're not going in there.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.999
We agreed on five minutes
eight minutes ago.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.127
Just relax and sit in the car, okay?
You're gonna get her killed.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.046
You're gonna get yourself killed.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.007
Stay back, I'm serious. Stay back. Stay--

39:45.925 --> 39:48.886
-[grunting] Damn it. Shit.
-Get in the car.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.346
Get in the fucking car!

39:51.222 --> 39:53.307
[Ruth] Can someone fucking help me here?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.517
[grunts]

39:56.977 --> 39:58.354
[Ruth straining]

40:00.398 --> 40:02.733
[easy listening music playing on speakers]

40:07.530 --> 40:08.489
Ah.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.118
[chuckling]

40:12.827 --> 40:13.786
Hello, Senator!

40:14.286 --> 40:15.871
You two really came through.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.166
[chuckles]

40:20.209 --> 40:21.669
Uh, what are you drinking?

40:21.752 --> 40:22.586
Uh, bourbon.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.629
Good for me.

40:23.712 --> 40:24.547
Me too.

40:25.631 --> 40:26.465
[Jim] Thanks.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.468
[chuckling] Well,
your spirits have improved.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.720
Well, no joy being more sweet

40:31.804 --> 40:34.181
than finding you've been
worrying about nothing.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.308
[Jim chuckling]

40:37.184 --> 40:38.060
Thank you.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.523
[Jim] Uh, so can we, uh, assume that

40:42.606 --> 40:45.818
you are officially on the board
of The Byrde Family Foundation?

40:48.112 --> 40:49.280
Yes, you can.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.074
Thank you for easing my mind.

40:57.746 --> 40:58.831
And now--

40:58.914 --> 41:02.918
Why do I get the feeling this is about
more than just stock trading?

41:03.002 --> 41:06.213
Since the risk of tampering
with a federal wire-fraud investigation

41:06.297 --> 41:10.176
is a lot more serious than a father
buying stocks in his son's company.

41:10.759 --> 41:14.472
Eh, maybe a whistleblower
needed to be dealt with.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.391
What kind of whistleblower?

41:18.184 --> 41:19.894
Engineer who knows things.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.854
[Wendy] What kind of things?

41:22.438 --> 41:24.398
You're asking a lot of questions.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.275
Just one.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.611
[sighs]

41:30.279 --> 41:34.325
My grandson, uh,
developed a computer system

41:34.408 --> 41:37.203
more accurate and versatile
than anything to date.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.122
And as part of this other investigation,

41:40.206 --> 41:44.001
one of the engineers might have been
considering telling details

41:44.084 --> 41:45.544
about the technology.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.254
Might have been.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.091
Mmm, he… He no longer is.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.477
And what does this technology do?

42:02.895 --> 42:05.523
It can't be audited
by any outside agencies,

42:05.606 --> 42:08.234
even when it appears transparent.

42:08.317 --> 42:09.902
But the point being,

42:09.985 --> 42:13.572
you two did a great job for my family.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.617
Thank you Jim, Wendy Byrde.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.786
Hmm. [sighs]

42:26.168 --> 42:28.254
Those machines can suppress votes.

42:28.754 --> 42:29.588
Yeah.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.924
Jesus. They can throw elections.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.760
Ain't gonna be throwing them your way.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.635
Hey, I was thinking

43:17.886 --> 43:21.056
maybe that website and all those posters
are going a little far.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.892
It's probably upsetting Ruth.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.061
Ruth is fine.

43:26.687 --> 43:27.938
She knows what it is.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.733
Yeah, I feel like we made
our point though, right?

43:31.317 --> 43:32.693
Maybe take it all down?

43:39.783 --> 43:40.784
Who's asking?

43:43.537 --> 43:44.788
No one's asking.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.626
At the market.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.545
You forgot my custard.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.383
I only have one rule.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.220
Never lie to me. Understand?

44:27.289 --> 44:28.624
Who the fuck are you?

44:29.124 --> 44:31.251
Yeah, The ginger told me I could sit here.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.295
I hope that's okay. I'm Mel Sattem.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.631
Helen Pierce's husband
hired me to find her.

44:36.298 --> 44:37.883
So what? You're like a PI?

44:37.966 --> 44:38.926
Uh…

44:39.009 --> 44:40.302
[chuckles] Yeah.

44:40.386 --> 44:43.347
Look, do you mind if we talk inside,
I'm kind of freezing out here.

44:43.889 --> 44:45.599
Yeah, I fucking mind.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.853
Look, I'm not here
to bust your balls, I swear,

44:49.937 --> 44:52.564
I'm just looking for somebody
to point me in a direction.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.339
Mind if I have a cookie?

45:17.840 --> 45:18.924
Sorry, all out.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.176
Just people with cookie jars

45:22.136 --> 45:23.178
usually got cookies.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.597
Well, I don't. Okay?

45:26.724 --> 45:27.558
Okay.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.605
So, um… why the fuck
would I know where Helen is?

45:34.189 --> 45:36.275
Well, I thought your boyfriend Ben might.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.819
[scoffs] Yeah, that's over.

45:38.902 --> 45:39.778
[Mel] Oh.

45:41.029 --> 45:43.407
That's a sore spot, probably. I'm sorry.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.077
You, uh… you have any idea where he is?

45:49.580 --> 45:50.456
Look.

45:53.417 --> 45:57.337
He ever hit you or anything? I'm just
asking because of his, uh, drug problem.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.547
[Ruth chuckles]

46:00.090 --> 46:01.967
He didn't have a drug problem.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.553
I thought-- I thought he did.

46:04.636 --> 46:07.264
Yeah, well, he didn't. Mm-mm.

46:11.477 --> 46:14.813
So, uh… Marty and Wendy Byrde,
you know them well?

46:16.356 --> 46:18.484
I thought you were looking for Helen.

46:20.527 --> 46:22.488
Look, I just need a signature.

46:23.822 --> 46:27.075
Or her body. I don't really give a shit
if anybody did anything wrong.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.289
You know what?

46:32.372 --> 46:34.249
I'm-- I'm real tired.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.543
And, uh, it's past my bedtime.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.630
If anything occurs to you…

46:40.130 --> 46:41.048
It won't.

46:45.552 --> 46:47.137
-Appreciate the time.
-Hmm.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.897
[sighs]

46:58.148 --> 47:00.150
[bugs chirring]

47:03.946 --> 47:04.780
[Marty] Wendy?

47:04.863 --> 47:05.697
[Wendy] Yeah?

47:06.907 --> 47:07.866
[Marty] Hi there.

47:08.575 --> 47:09.409
[Wendy] Hey.

47:09.993 --> 47:11.245
[Marty sighs]

47:11.787 --> 47:13.497
Jesus. Are you okay?

47:15.123 --> 47:17.084
Oh, uh… I'm fine.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.126
What happened?

47:18.919 --> 47:21.672
Um. We, uh… got the deal done.

47:21.755 --> 47:25.008
After being outside the trap house
and getting the shit kicked out of me,

47:25.092 --> 47:26.426
a shower's not a bad idea.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.011
Uh, how'd it go with Schafer?

47:30.681 --> 47:31.932
We got the deal done.

47:36.019 --> 47:36.854
Good.

47:38.063 --> 47:40.607
[crickets chirping]

48:02.588 --> 48:04.840
You know, you probably do
want to go to college.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.175
And I'll tell you why.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.596
It's only a matter of time
before you mess up

48:10.679 --> 48:12.681
and she'll get so pissed, she'll fire you,

48:13.265 --> 48:14.433
then where will you be?

48:15.434 --> 48:17.352
Making $8.60 an hour at Walmart?

48:29.656 --> 48:30.824
[sighs]

48:48.592 --> 48:50.385
[horn honks]

49:13.075 --> 49:14.451
Kind of late, isn't it?

49:15.452 --> 49:17.371
I want to talk about my sheriff.

49:18.246 --> 49:19.456
[chuckling] What?

49:20.082 --> 49:22.167
I know you got rid of Nix's body.

49:23.877 --> 49:25.629
It doesn't matter if I can't prove it.

49:25.712 --> 49:30.384
What matters is that
your own boy ratted you out.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.179
I don't know what you're talking about.

49:34.262 --> 49:36.682
[sarcastic] But thanks again
for putting up all those signs.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.684
Can we pay you or something?

49:38.767 --> 49:40.978
I mean, it was so, so thoughtful!

49:41.061 --> 49:42.562
Don't give me that shit.

49:42.646 --> 49:45.524
You know, if you don't mind
my saying, Darlene,

49:46.900 --> 49:49.194
I think it's hard
for you to admit sometimes

49:49.277 --> 49:52.614
what a… kind soul you are.

49:53.115 --> 49:54.658
Kind.

49:54.741 --> 49:57.577
And helpful,
like letting us work with Ruth.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.330
What are you talking about?

50:01.373 --> 50:03.375
The drugs you sold Frank Jr.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.585
he sold to us,
we sold to our people, and--

50:05.669 --> 50:08.797
You know, so it was a big, big help.

50:09.297 --> 50:10.549
Thanks for that too.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.676
Oh.

50:14.261 --> 50:15.220
Long day?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.098
You look kind of tired.

50:19.474 --> 50:22.686
You just keep Charlotte away from Wyatt.

50:22.769 --> 50:23.687
Do you hear me?

50:23.770 --> 50:27.733
They're old friends,
I'll do nothing of the kind.

50:27.816 --> 50:30.569
-You know what?
-What, Darlene? What?

50:31.153 --> 50:32.112
What?

50:32.195 --> 50:34.781
What, are you gonna kill
every pretty girl in the Ozarks?

50:36.658 --> 50:38.660
[Darlene gasping]

50:40.287 --> 50:42.748
[straining] Call a fucking ambulance.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.001
[wheezing]

50:58.555 --> 51:01.641
[strained breathing]

51:05.062 --> 51:08.273
[ominous music playing]

51:21.369 --> 51:23.497
[dialing]

51:23.580 --> 51:25.749
[dispatch] 911, what's your emergency?

51:25.832 --> 51:29.753
[ominous music plays]
