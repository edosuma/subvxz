02:28.093 --> 02:29.886
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

02:29.803 --> 02:31.096
See you tomorrow.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.305
How you doing?

03:18.890 --> 03:19.807
Okay.

03:21.309 --> 03:24.019
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.

03:24.186 --> 03:26.689
If you're looking for work,
you may want to try Aberdeen.

03:26.897 --> 03:28.899
That's about the closest mill work
you'll find.

03:29.107 --> 03:31.109
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.

03:31.318 --> 03:34.112
You know, we have a really nice casino,
the Wild Cherry.

03:34.195 --> 03:36.781
Want to make some money,
maybe you ought to go on down...

03:36.906 --> 03:38.700
and try your luck at the blackjack tables.

03:38.908 --> 03:40.785
No, I don't think so. Thanks.

03:41.285 --> 03:42.703
You're Chris Vaughn?

03:45.080 --> 03:47.791
Well, hell. I know all about you, Chris.

03:48.292 --> 03:50.711
I know your folks. I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.

03:50.919 --> 03:53.213
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!

03:53.296 --> 03:56.007
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.

03:56.299 --> 03:58.217
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.

03:58.509 --> 03:59.802
Well, hell, Chris.

04:00.303 --> 04:03.597
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

04:03.806 --> 04:05.182
- I insist.
- I'll walk.

04:05.307 --> 04:06.517
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.

04:06.684 --> 04:09.603
I won't take no for an answer. Get in the car.

04:12.814 --> 04:15.191
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.

04:16.608 --> 04:17.819
I scared him.

04:25.117 --> 04:26.410
You were gone a while, huh?

04:26.410 --> 04:29.413
Eight years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

04:30.414 --> 04:31.790
Aaron Harstad, yeah.

04:33.583 --> 04:34.584
Sad story.

04:35.001 --> 04:39.297
About five months back,
he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.

04:40.882 --> 04:43.092
Car folded up like an accordion.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.679
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.784
All right.

05:14.996 --> 05:17.999
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.

05:21.711 --> 05:24.088
It's election month. I'm your man.

05:27.091 --> 05:29.009
Okay. Say hey to your old man.

05:30.302 --> 05:31.219
Let's go.

05:57.202 --> 05:58.494
Can I help you?

06:01.080 --> 06:03.916
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.

06:12.507 --> 06:14.718
- You look great.
- What is this?

06:15.009 --> 06:18.012
I couldn't let you be
the only one looking good in uniform.

06:18.304 --> 06:20.306
Hey, Ma. Chris is here.

06:20.806 --> 06:22.892
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.019
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.188
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?

06:32.400 --> 06:34.486
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.321
For good. I'm home.

06:36.404 --> 06:38.614
- Really? You're not kidding?
- No.

06:43.994 --> 06:45.913
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.

06:47.790 --> 06:51.209
I wish you had told us exactly when
you were coming. I'd have cooked.

06:51.501 --> 06:53.086
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.

06:53.086 --> 06:55.380
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?

06:55.713 --> 06:59.008
I was planning to work at the mill,
but you never mentioned it closed.

06:59.092 --> 07:01.594
We didn't want to bother you
when your father got laid off.

07:01.802 --> 07:03.804
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.

07:04.013 --> 07:07.016
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in...

07:07.182 --> 07:08.892
we try to keep things simple.

07:09.101 --> 07:10.102
Pete.

07:11.186 --> 07:13.605
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.

07:13.813 --> 07:15.190
Sit down. Say hello.

07:15.398 --> 07:17.317
Last time he saw you,
you were barely walking.

07:17.483 --> 07:20.111
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.

07:20.319 --> 07:21.404
It was Chris' room first.

07:21.612 --> 07:24.490
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.

07:24.698 --> 07:26.992
Doesn't look like it's going to rain
to me, Colonel.

07:27.201 --> 07:28.410
Sit down. Eat something.

07:28.619 --> 07:30.912
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.

07:31.079 --> 07:32.289
A grunt.

07:33.081 --> 07:35.500
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!

07:37.418 --> 07:40.379
Poppa's still got your gun locked up
in the garage.

07:40.713 --> 07:44.091
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.511
No. I'm still hoping
you'll melt that thing down on your own.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.097
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.

07:50.389 --> 07:52.891
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.

07:53.183 --> 07:54.517
- 10:30.
- 10:00.

07:54.809 --> 07:56.186
Remind you of anyone?

08:45.397 --> 08:47.608
Okay, it rained. Happy?

08:49.693 --> 08:50.610
No.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.282
Why don't you crash on the floor?

08:57.909 --> 09:00.912
Okay. I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.

09:10.295 --> 09:11.505
Keep you dry.

09:14.382 --> 09:16.092
Did you really kill people?

09:51.416 --> 09:53.293
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.

09:54.586 --> 09:56.588
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.715
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

10:00.383 --> 10:01.384
What is that?

10:01.384 --> 10:04.386
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?

10:08.015 --> 10:10.309
- How you been?
- Good.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.310
- Clean living?
- Please. You want a beer?

10:12.519 --> 10:15.605
No. Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.

10:15.688 --> 10:17.106
Okay. Here.

10:17.482 --> 10:18.608
Thanks, man.

10:20.902 --> 10:23.112
Like that? When you left town...

10:23.320 --> 10:25.990
it gave me the idea I should do something
with my life, too.

10:26.198 --> 10:30.202
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar,
and became all about music.

10:30.494 --> 10:33.580
And then, pretty soon,
I was about music and drugs...

10:33.705 --> 10:36.499
and pretty soon
I was basically just about drugs...

10:37.083 --> 10:39.502
and ended up doing two years for B and E.

10:41.712 --> 10:42.713
I'm sorry.

10:44.215 --> 10:47.801
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.

10:48.010 --> 10:52.013
Doing construction and renewing
those supportive and healthy friendships...

10:52.305 --> 10:53.306
from my past.

10:53.390 --> 10:56.601
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards,
told them you were back...

10:56.809 --> 10:59.604
and they asked me
to politely remind you that it is Saturday.

10:59.687 --> 11:02.106
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.

11:08.195 --> 11:10.113
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.

11:10.197 --> 11:11.198
We're still doing it.

11:11.406 --> 11:13.992
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely. Let's go, superstar!

11:14.200 --> 11:17.287
- Just like the old days. Go deep.
- Come on.

11:19.580 --> 11:20.998
When did that happen?

11:21.207 --> 11:22.291
Jay Hamilton Field.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.294
His parents hadn't left him the mill
for more than two minutes...

11:25.419 --> 11:27.212
- before he shut it down.
- Why?

11:28.297 --> 11:29.298
Heads up!

11:29.798 --> 11:31.591
Because I opened my casino.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.219
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?

11:34.511 --> 11:36.095
Still got your reflexes.

11:36.513 --> 11:39.015
What? Did you get tired
of being all that you could be?

11:39.182 --> 11:41.100
- No. I'm still all I can be.
- Really?

11:41.309 --> 11:43.602
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.314
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax. Catch my breath.

11:47.398 --> 11:48.815
- You? Relax?
- Yeah.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.487
Not today.

11:57.198 --> 11:58.700
I got it.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.910
Let's go. Come on!

12:09.084 --> 12:10.919
Is that how it's going to be?

12:11.420 --> 12:12.796
That's how it is.

12:12.879 --> 12:15.799
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch. Too rough?

12:16.007 --> 12:17.091
Sorry, ladies.

12:20.011 --> 12:21.387
Pick up the outside!

12:24.515 --> 12:26.684
- Fumble!
- Set!

12:29.311 --> 12:30.812
How's that for touch?

12:32.481 --> 12:34.899
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?

12:34.983 --> 12:36.317
- That the best you got?
- What?

12:36.484 --> 12:38.403
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?

12:38.611 --> 12:40.488
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.

12:48.787 --> 12:51.790
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going. We're not going to go.

12:58.713 --> 13:00.089
You almost caught it.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.596
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.

13:07.679 --> 13:10.390
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.

13:10.599 --> 13:13.810
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross. You stay in and block.

13:14.102 --> 13:16.020
Booth? Isolate on Vaughn.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.981
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.

13:18.106 --> 13:20.399
- Go low. Left knee.
- All right, man.

13:20.691 --> 13:23.402
You got it? On the first hut. Ready? Break!

13:24.820 --> 13:25.779
Be strong.

13:29.116 --> 13:31.201
All right, Chris Vaughn. Last chance.

13:32.994 --> 13:35.497
- Black-nineteen! Black!
- Watch the outside!

13:40.918 --> 13:41.919
I'm open!

13:49.384 --> 13:50.510
That's game.

13:52.387 --> 13:53.680
Sorry about that.

13:56.182 --> 13:57.183
Cool, man.

14:03.397 --> 14:04.815
Nice game, ladies.

14:05.608 --> 14:07.192
What the hell was that?

14:14.199 --> 14:17.118
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?

14:19.412 --> 14:22.081
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.

14:23.499 --> 14:24.792
Good to be back.

14:25.584 --> 14:26.919
See you around.

14:27.795 --> 14:31.089
If you're not doing anything later on,
want to come by the casino?

14:31.381 --> 14:35.385
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me. What do you say?

14:39.097 --> 14:40.681
- See you tonight.
- Cool.

14:41.098 --> 14:42.600
I'll see you later on.

14:46.312 --> 14:47.187
Be good.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.820
Hey, Sarge. Good game. Maybe next time.

14:57.614 --> 14:58.614
Hold up.

15:01.409 --> 15:04.620
Maybe next time I won't see you
in the bleachers, smoking weed.

15:14.295 --> 15:15.713
Welcome home, buddy.

15:18.007 --> 15:20.384
I thought you had to be Native American
to own a casino.

15:20.718 --> 15:23.721
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.

15:23.888 --> 15:27.307
And what he slid under the table
convinced the powers that be it was true.

15:27.391 --> 15:31.019
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.

15:31.311 --> 15:33.605
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.608
Just so you guys know,
I'm done after I triple my money.

15:36.691 --> 15:38.609
That's what you said last time.

15:38.818 --> 15:40.695
You wound up selling your body
for bus fare.

15:40.903 --> 15:42.113
He had to walk.

15:42.488 --> 15:44.907
Nobody's going to have any problems
finding this place.

15:45.115 --> 15:48.619
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive.

15:48.994 --> 15:51.204
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.916
- Hi there.
- Hi. How you doing?

15:59.796 --> 16:02.006
- See? Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.

16:02.506 --> 16:05.009
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips. Let's gamble.

16:05.217 --> 16:07.302
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?

16:09.304 --> 16:12.891
Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs
under one great, big roof.

16:13.808 --> 16:17.520
You got your ATM machines,
tellers to cash your paycheck...

16:17.687 --> 16:20.398
and when you're here,
you don't got to worry about things...

16:20.481 --> 16:24.693
like child support, rent,
laws of mathematical probability.

16:31.283 --> 16:34.703
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like
to invite you to the VIP lounge.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.089
- The dream team. You all healed up?
- Nice place.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.508
Welcome to my world.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.511
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.

16:53.803 --> 16:56.389
If you need
a little female companionship, done.

16:57.098 --> 16:58.099
All right?

16:58.308 --> 17:01.018
- Get inside. Have a good time.
- Where you going?

17:01.185 --> 17:04.188
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do. Enjoy.

17:06.607 --> 17:09.693
Just remember,
nothing in here is free. Ma'am.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.195
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.

17:13.488 --> 17:15.698
Come on, this place is nothing
but fake boobs...

17:15.906 --> 17:18.201
and real assholes, if you ask me.

17:18.409 --> 17:19.410
Just water for me.

17:19.618 --> 17:22.204
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.

17:22.413 --> 17:24.205
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.

17:24.415 --> 17:25.915
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.

17:27.501 --> 17:28.710
Let's play, boys.

17:29.795 --> 17:31.296
Go right ahead.

17:32.005 --> 17:33.215
Already lost $1...

17:33.381 --> 17:34.716
Good night.

17:35.216 --> 17:37.885
Okay. Don't say we never did nothing
for you.

17:38.886 --> 17:41.389
Don't worry, buddy,
everybody's scared their first time.

17:41.597 --> 17:43.516
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.811
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.

17:48.896 --> 17:51.481
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning...

17:51.815 --> 17:53.108
we'll send a search party.

17:53.191 --> 17:54.901
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.

19:06.091 --> 19:08.719
You from here, or are you just visiting?

19:12.597 --> 19:13.890
A little of both.

19:15.892 --> 19:17.185
I grew up here.

19:19.312 --> 19:21.397
So you're seeing all the old faces.

19:22.898 --> 19:24.316
You could say that.

19:33.617 --> 19:35.493
Your voice sounds very familiar.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.501
Chris.

19:44.585 --> 19:45.586
Deni.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.107
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?

20:09.316 --> 20:13.403
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?

20:13.695 --> 20:15.780
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.408
Let's go.

20:19.409 --> 20:21.202
Six, easy six. Looking for a six to win.

20:21.285 --> 20:23.204
We can do a six. Can we do a six?

20:23.412 --> 20:25.289
I think I can do a six, right?

20:25.789 --> 20:28.500
We got liftoff! Whack it, boys. Whack it.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.795
Blue or pink, what do you think?

20:34.714 --> 20:36.216
Who's up for two out of three?

20:36.299 --> 20:39.093
I'm getting killed. Let me have a C-note
to put $200 on a bet.

20:39.385 --> 20:40.303
- No.
- Come on.

20:40.386 --> 20:41.721
Hell, no.

20:41.887 --> 20:43.013
Look at them.

20:44.807 --> 20:45.683
He's hot.

20:47.017 --> 20:49.811
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.

20:50.687 --> 20:51.813
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.607
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.

20:54.816 --> 20:57.402
There's another $100. Boom.
Give me some dice.

20:57.610 --> 20:59.612
Looking for a six.

20:59.987 --> 21:02.406
All right. Oh, please. Please.

21:03.115 --> 21:04.617
Thank you. And you.

21:06.118 --> 21:08.412
- Jimmy, don't roll. Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.706
Hard six, six. Looking for a six.

21:12.207 --> 21:15.210
Seven out. Line in, the dark side wins.

21:15.418 --> 21:17.003
Last come'll get you some.

21:20.381 --> 21:24.301
- You're good. But I saw it.
- Saw what?

21:25.302 --> 21:26.595
I saw the switch.

21:27.221 --> 21:28.597
This is a clean game, asshole.

21:30.599 --> 21:32.017
Let's see about that.

21:34.811 --> 21:36.479
Bet you'll roll a seven.

21:39.190 --> 21:40.816
It's not your roll, sir.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.195
Sir, it's not your roll.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.989
Will you call security?

21:47.114 --> 21:49.116
Put your bets down on the passline.

21:49.283 --> 21:51.993
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?

21:52.285 --> 21:54.204
No. We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.

21:54.204 --> 21:55.997
The dice are coming up seven.

21:57.081 --> 22:00.084
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.

22:02.795 --> 22:05.381
- What a surprise.
- No, folks. No payouts.

22:05.589 --> 22:07.007
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.

22:07.216 --> 22:09.217
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.

22:09.384 --> 22:11.219
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.

22:11.303 --> 22:12.304
You're not the shooter.

22:12.387 --> 22:14.389
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.

22:15.014 --> 22:19.018
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.

22:19.894 --> 22:21.812
Does your boss know about this?

22:22.897 --> 22:24.690
Just give me my money.

22:32.697 --> 22:34.783
Come on. Let's go.

22:52.892 --> 22:54.518
What now, bitch? Come on!

23:38.392 --> 23:39.684
Special Forces.

23:40.685 --> 23:43.104
Wow. I'll take that.

23:53.906 --> 23:55.282
What are you doing?

24:00.120 --> 24:02.288
Special Forces. Special treatment.

24:06.209 --> 24:07.919
This guy knows Hamilton.

24:14.008 --> 24:17.302
You just hold him down. Come on, Burke.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.716
Folks.

25:01.301 --> 25:03.887
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.

25:04.304 --> 25:06.889
Whoever did this left him for dead.

25:07.390 --> 25:09.100
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.

25:09.183 --> 25:12.811
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...

25:13.020 --> 25:15.606
I'll also need a copy of your write-up,
with toxicology...

25:15.814 --> 25:18.108
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?

25:18.316 --> 25:19.901
I'm just trying to get some facts.

25:19.985 --> 25:23.988
You need to be arresting whoever tried
to kill my brother, not testing his blood.

25:24.280 --> 25:27.700
I'm just doing my job, Michelle. Okay?
I understand how you feel.

25:27.909 --> 25:29.785
But we still don't know who started all this.

25:29.994 --> 25:33.080
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.

25:33.914 --> 25:36.083
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn. I really will.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.919
In the meantime I have to file a full report.

25:39.086 --> 25:42.881
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.

25:47.009 --> 25:49.887
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.

26:12.616 --> 26:15.786
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you. They're for my best friend.

26:17.287 --> 26:20.916
Hey, Sarge. So much for our VIP status.

26:26.587 --> 26:29.715
Don't they teach you
any basic fighting skills in the Army?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.008
How did you do?

26:31.092 --> 26:35.012
Not good. But I tell you,
that guy was feeling me this morning.

26:39.182 --> 26:42.811
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.

26:43.603 --> 26:47.398
Chris, I don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't exactly home anymore.

27:05.581 --> 27:06.582
Hang on.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.420
Let me help you. Come on.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.184
I'm good, Mom. I got it.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.189
- Need some help?
- No. I'm just milking it.

27:35.609 --> 27:37.903
There's some old crutches in the garage.

27:41.781 --> 27:44.909
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches. That's nice.

27:57.796 --> 27:59.214
Did you see the hole?

28:09.181 --> 28:11.517
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.

28:14.686 --> 28:17.314
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.

28:17.481 --> 28:18.482
You make this?

28:18.690 --> 28:19.816
Need anything?

28:19.816 --> 28:22.610
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man. It's good.

28:23.319 --> 28:24.988
No, I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

28:50.094 --> 28:52.805
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.

28:53.013 --> 28:55.516
I might've had serious issues
with your career choice...

28:55.682 --> 28:59.102
but it just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.

29:00.604 --> 29:01.688
Where you headed?

29:01.896 --> 29:04.190
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?

29:04.482 --> 29:05.400
Let's go.

29:15.701 --> 29:18.995
Your whole life,
all you wanted to do was get out of here.

29:19.412 --> 29:21.206
What made you come back now?

29:22.290 --> 29:24.584
You're going to think I'm crazy.

29:25.084 --> 29:27.003
I would think about the mill.

29:27.587 --> 29:31.882
When I was a kid going to visit you at work,
the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...

29:34.009 --> 29:35.594
You remember that smell.

29:37.095 --> 29:40.015
I remember a lot of nice things
before the mill closed.

29:44.894 --> 29:46.896
When did they go out of business?

29:47.188 --> 29:48.981
Closed about six months ago.

29:49.815 --> 29:52.484
There's a Home Depot
about 15 minutes up the road.

29:54.194 --> 29:55.112
And that?

29:58.198 --> 29:59.282
Don't ask.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.218
First of all, I just want to say thanks.

30:21.803 --> 30:24.389
- For what?
- For making that stickman.

30:25.306 --> 30:28.100
He's been fired
and his gaming permit's been pulled.

30:28.809 --> 30:33.314
I just have no idea
why my security cameras didn't catch that.

30:36.984 --> 30:39.611
They miss a lot in your place,
don't they, Jay?

30:40.695 --> 30:43.907
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.

30:44.991 --> 30:46.200
Wait a second.

30:47.785 --> 30:50.996
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy. Understandably.

30:51.080 --> 30:54.792
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis.

30:55.084 --> 30:57.002
Look, they've been reprimanded.

30:57.294 --> 30:59.004
But they say you went nuts, man.

30:59.087 --> 31:01.089
I'm sorry. Insensitive.

31:01.298 --> 31:04.092
I know the proper term that vets use
is post-traumatic stress...

31:04.300 --> 31:07.512
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever. You tore my place apart...

31:07.595 --> 31:10.514
and it wasn't easy to get my guys
to agree not to press charges.

31:10.681 --> 31:13.892
Chris, if you had a problem,
shouldn't you have come to me?

31:16.520 --> 31:18.480
I want to bring you inside.

31:19.106 --> 31:21.316
I want to make you head of security.

31:22.192 --> 31:24.986
- What do you say?
- No.

31:33.202 --> 31:36.788
I guess you probably need time
to think about it. I figured as much.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.293
This is for you.

31:42.210 --> 31:45.088
It's a little something to help you get,
you know...

31:47.298 --> 31:49.091
Come on, man, don't be like that.

31:49.216 --> 31:53.387
I came all the way out here to your house,
just to see you get back on your feet.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.098
I'm going to the sheriff.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.185
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

32:03.396 --> 32:05.189
I'll see you around, Chris.

32:18.618 --> 32:20.787
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?

32:24.290 --> 32:25.291
Excuse me.

32:26.793 --> 32:28.002
Excuse me.

32:29.211 --> 32:30.713
I got to call you back.

32:32.506 --> 32:33.799
Hey, Chris.

32:34.299 --> 32:37.094
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.

32:37.302 --> 32:38.887
I'm here to press charges.

32:39.804 --> 32:42.599
This isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back?

32:42.891 --> 32:44.017
Yeah. It is.

32:44.309 --> 32:46.185
Because that matter's closed.

32:46.894 --> 32:50.398
You're lucky you weren't brought in
on charges. I mean...

32:50.689 --> 32:52.399
Did you even look into it?

32:53.192 --> 32:56.695
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.

32:56.987 --> 32:58.697
An internal investigation?

33:00.198 --> 33:03.284
I know you're familiar
with the term no-fly zone.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.912
Because that's what the casino is.

33:06.204 --> 33:08.289
Since the mill closed down...

33:08.706 --> 33:12.084
that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town.

33:12.293 --> 33:15.295
So case closed, basically.

33:17.089 --> 33:18.298
We'll see you.

33:19.382 --> 33:23.011
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?

33:31.185 --> 33:35.481
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.

33:37.316 --> 33:41.403
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.

33:42.404 --> 33:44.614
This is my town. Okay?

33:44.989 --> 33:46.491
I'm the sheriff here.

33:46.699 --> 33:49.702
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.

33:52.413 --> 33:54.498
Now please get out of my building.

34:16.685 --> 34:18.895
- Come in.
- Thanks.

34:19.813 --> 34:21.188
This belongs to you.

34:23.483 --> 34:25.818
I appreciate that. I thought this was history.

34:25.985 --> 34:28.612
- Could have left it in the trash, but l...
- Deni?

34:28.696 --> 34:31.407
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.

34:35.202 --> 34:37.411
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

34:37.621 --> 34:39.789
Quick walk. Mom, I'll be right back.

34:44.502 --> 34:47.380
- How you been?
- Been better.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.507
Talk to the sheriff yet?

34:50.800 --> 34:54.011
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.

34:54.219 --> 34:56.888
He sure as hell didn't seem
like much of a sheriff.

34:57.681 --> 34:59.599
He's up for reelection, you know.

34:59.808 --> 35:03.311
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.190
How about you?

35:08.816 --> 35:11.110
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.611
Been reading these books.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.489
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.617
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?

35:19.284 --> 35:20.702
I have my moments.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.497
So, the casino, huh?

35:25.206 --> 35:28.209
Yeah. Been there almost a year.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.213
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.

35:34.798 --> 35:36.091
I like that.

35:37.509 --> 35:39.719
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself,
hasn't he?

35:39.886 --> 35:41.805
He's a real go-getter, that one.

35:42.806 --> 35:44.682
He must be. I heard he got you.

35:47.393 --> 35:50.813
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.

35:54.191 --> 35:56.109
You still work for him, though.

35:56.902 --> 35:58.695
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.

35:59.988 --> 36:01.197
I suppose so.

36:03.616 --> 36:05.618
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?

36:20.215 --> 36:21.716
Thanks for the jacket.

36:25.219 --> 36:26.512
And where is he?

36:41.401 --> 36:43.319
It's okay, Mom. He's stabilized.

36:45.488 --> 36:46.614
It was close.

36:47.198 --> 36:48.282
Crystal meth.

36:48.491 --> 36:50.910
I'm sorry. I never did it before.

36:51.118 --> 36:54.204
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.

36:59.417 --> 37:02.003
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...

37:02.087 --> 37:03.004
Stop.

37:05.006 --> 37:06.799
Where?

37:07.008 --> 37:09.385
From the security guys
working at the casino.

37:12.596 --> 37:14.515
Chris, wait. Call the police.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.808
No. It won't do any good.

37:27.902 --> 37:29.695
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.

37:32.406 --> 37:33.782
What are you doing?

37:35.993 --> 37:37.703
No, Chris. Not like this.

37:39.704 --> 37:40.914
Listen to me.

37:40.997 --> 37:44.209
If you go out of here with that gun,
they're going to nail...

38:26.914 --> 38:28.499
I've been looking for you.

40:17.683 --> 40:20.310
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit, huh?

41:01.507 --> 41:03.884
You should not have come
looking for trouble.

41:04.009 --> 41:07.012
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.

41:07.304 --> 41:08.180
Now!

41:10.682 --> 41:13.810
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.

41:14.102 --> 41:15.812
Put your hands on the hood.

41:20.691 --> 41:24.319
I advise you to give this offer
more than a little serious thought.

41:24.820 --> 41:27.197
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.990
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.

41:29.115 --> 41:32.118
Normally they wouldn't even
put it on the table...

41:32.202 --> 41:34.495
but your military record can't be ignored.

41:34.704 --> 41:37.790
Three months home arrest,
some community service...

41:38.791 --> 41:42.002
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.

41:42.795 --> 41:44.296
Look at it from the other side.

41:44.379 --> 41:47.883
There's over a dozen witnesses,
none of whom will paint a flattering picture.

41:48.216 --> 41:50.719
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.

41:50.885 --> 41:53.096
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.

41:53.304 --> 41:55.807
They're only offering me this deal
just to keep me quiet.

41:56.015 --> 41:57.892
I still say you should take it.

41:58.392 --> 42:01.312
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

42:03.313 --> 42:04.982
Our job is to keep order.

42:05.607 --> 42:07.984
There was no chance
of that once he came in.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.780
Me and my men,
we were just trying to control him.

42:13.698 --> 42:17.702
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.

42:19.203 --> 42:23.415
So violent, so dangerous,
so highly trained...

42:24.082 --> 42:28.086
that he dispatched six
of the casino security staff single-handedly.

42:28.795 --> 42:30.880
Six men, single-handedly.

42:32.090 --> 42:35.510
His weapon of choice,
a simple piece of cedar...

42:36.886 --> 42:40.514
which, in his hands,
became a devastating force with one aim:

42:40.806 --> 42:43.392
To hurt people and destroy property.

42:47.187 --> 42:51.399
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.

42:51.691 --> 42:55.319
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct. My right forearm.

42:56.487 --> 42:59.782
Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.

43:01.408 --> 43:03.118
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.

43:03.285 --> 43:06.413
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.583
Did he give you
any kind of advance warning...

43:10.709 --> 43:12.794
a chance to defend yourself?

43:12.919 --> 43:16.297
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.

43:16.380 --> 43:19.800
Besides, he seemed to be too busy
enjoying himself from what I could see.

43:20.092 --> 43:22.803
So from what you saw,
he seemed to have some kind of purpose?

43:23.011 --> 43:24.096
He had a point to prove.

43:24.304 --> 43:27.307
I was emptying machines
when he came in and started swinging.

43:27.516 --> 43:29.684
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.

43:29.809 --> 43:31.686
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.

43:31.895 --> 43:33.396
He seemed like a complete psychopath.

43:33.605 --> 43:35.815
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.

43:35.982 --> 43:37.400
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.

43:37.483 --> 43:38.984
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.

43:39.193 --> 43:40.402
I have no further questions.

43:40.611 --> 43:44.490
Mr. Crowe, you may present
your client's case.

43:45.782 --> 43:47.200
You're fired.

43:51.788 --> 43:55.583
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.

43:57.918 --> 43:59.003
Order!

44:03.298 --> 44:07.302
If you choose to represent yourself,
and not be represented by legal counsel...

44:07.594 --> 44:11.306
you realize that you can't
then claim a mistrial on that basis?

44:12.599 --> 44:14.892
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.

44:23.484 --> 44:25.611
I don't deny anything
that was said here today.

44:25.819 --> 44:27.988
Does that mean
you're changing your plea to guilty?

44:28.196 --> 44:29.781
I'm not guilty of anything...

44:29.990 --> 44:32.200
except standing up for myself
when the law wouldn't.

44:32.408 --> 44:35.119
Objection. He's trying
to introduce prior events.

44:35.286 --> 44:38.414
Sustained. Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.

44:41.917 --> 44:43.710
I grew up in this town.

44:44.086 --> 44:46.588
People used to walk tall in this town.

44:46.880 --> 44:49.382
They wouldn't have traded the mill
for a crooked casino.

44:49.507 --> 44:51.593
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

44:51.718 --> 44:54.721
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were sold to kids.

44:54.887 --> 44:55.805
- Objection!
- Sustained.

44:56.013 --> 44:59.183
Mr. Vaughn, you're close
to being held in contempt.

44:59.683 --> 45:01.185
I was justified in what I did.

45:01.310 --> 45:04.605
And if you acquit me of these charges,
then I'm gonna run for sheriff.

45:04.813 --> 45:07.190
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.

45:07.315 --> 45:08.984
Order.

45:10.485 --> 45:12.320
Please take your seat.

45:12.820 --> 45:15.406
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged
with contempt.

45:15.490 --> 45:17.617
And I will make sure that this...

45:17.783 --> 45:18.784
- Objection.
- Sustained.

45:18.909 --> 45:21.996
...never happens to anyone again
without punishing those who did it.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.706
I'm ordering the jury to ignore
what they've just seen.

45:24.915 --> 45:27.000
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.

45:30.712 --> 45:32.088
Order.

45:33.214 --> 45:35.591
Or you're all charged with contempt!

45:46.518 --> 45:49.312
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

45:49.521 --> 45:51.106
We have, Your Honor.

45:51.189 --> 45:52.815
Defendant, please rise.

45:53.691 --> 45:57.403
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn,
not guilty.

46:17.713 --> 46:19.090
This is mine.

46:28.390 --> 46:29.891
Sheriff Vaughn!

47:09.803 --> 47:12.305
You won the election. Congratulations.

47:12.597 --> 47:15.391
But we do have a tradition
of professional courtesy up here.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.602
And I can personally vouch
for each and every one of these men.

47:18.811 --> 47:20.312
They're good deputies.

47:20.479 --> 47:22.106
You're all fired.

48:40.803 --> 48:43.680
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.

48:46.391 --> 48:48.018
You're joking, right?

48:48.810 --> 48:50.395
License and registration.

49:01.488 --> 49:03.490
What's the problem, Sheriff?

49:04.116 --> 49:07.411
You. And the drugs you're peddling
out of your casino.

49:07.702 --> 49:11.498
The only thing that's going on in my casino
is construction. You took care of that.

49:11.790 --> 49:14.709
That's right. And I plan on taking care
of everything else, too.

49:14.792 --> 49:17.420
If you can, try to think this through:

49:17.712 --> 49:20.214
A casino is a license to print money.

49:20.506 --> 49:22.508
Why would I jeopardize that
by selling drugs?

49:22.716 --> 49:25.385
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.

49:25.594 --> 49:28.305
Really? The only thing I think has changed
around here...

49:28.388 --> 49:31.891
is that you get to wake up every morning
and put on that nifty little badge.

49:32.183 --> 49:36.020
But underneath it is the same guy who
couldn't make it playing college football...

49:36.187 --> 49:38.314
and apparently couldn't make it
in the Army...

49:38.481 --> 49:40.691
and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.

49:40.816 --> 49:42.609
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

49:43.110 --> 49:46.988
And if you push too hard, you're going
to be a man who never gets to see 40.

49:50.492 --> 49:52.118
License, please.

49:59.417 --> 50:00.918
Thanks, Sheriff.

50:03.295 --> 50:06.590
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.

50:06.798 --> 50:09.009
What's wrong with my taillights?

50:12.720 --> 50:14.097
They're broken.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.917
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

50:51.798 --> 50:52.715
No.

50:55.885 --> 50:58.304
Come on, man. You know I hate cops.

50:58.512 --> 51:02.307
You've been sheriff for about two minutes,
and I'm already starting to hate you.

51:02.516 --> 51:05.018
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.

51:05.102 --> 51:08.813
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors
for friends. That's how it starts.

51:09.105 --> 51:12.192
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes,
setting up roadblocks...

51:12.400 --> 51:14.986
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?

51:19.115 --> 51:22.284
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.

51:22.409 --> 51:24.912
I need you to take me to drug school.

51:31.418 --> 51:33.294
I get to wear a uniform?

51:34.212 --> 51:36.714
The stuff in this town
is five-star, factory pure.

51:36.881 --> 51:39.300
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.

51:39.508 --> 51:42.511
We know Hamilton's boys
are selling that shit down at the casino.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.680
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.

51:44.805 --> 51:47.808
So we got to play follow-the-money,
starting with the tweakers.

51:48.016 --> 51:49.601
That'll give us the suppliers.

51:49.809 --> 51:53.396
These guys are real edgy,
so delicacy is the key.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.107
Then we put the squeeze on them...

51:56.315 --> 51:58.317
till they spit out the location
of the next buy.

51:58.484 --> 52:00.903
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.

52:01.904 --> 52:03.489
That's a good show.

52:04.406 --> 52:06.199
Phase three: we strike.

52:06.408 --> 52:10.620
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right. Delicacy and precision.

52:10.912 --> 52:13.498
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.

52:28.512 --> 52:32.182
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.

52:33.099 --> 52:34.600
- Officer.
- Yeah.

52:38.187 --> 52:39.480
Search him.

52:42.399 --> 52:46.403
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs. Arms down.

52:48.905 --> 52:50.615
You been working out?

52:52.700 --> 52:53.993
Nothing there.

52:55.411 --> 52:57.288
Somebody needs a bath.

53:07.798 --> 53:10.383
Now you read me my rights,
then you take me in...

53:11.885 --> 53:13.595
and I call my lawyer.

53:13.720 --> 53:17.390
Okay. But I have a hunch
there may be something else in here.

53:19.391 --> 53:20.392
Could be.

53:27.107 --> 53:29.484
Go to it, Deputy. Have a good time.

54:10.313 --> 54:12.398
- He ain't talking.
- I know.

54:30.290 --> 54:32.000
Handles pretty good.

54:44.219 --> 54:45.512
He's clean.

54:49.891 --> 54:52.101
Guess we got to go with Plan B.

54:53.186 --> 54:55.104
Screw you both.

54:55.897 --> 54:58.107
I do have a bit of information for you.

54:58.315 --> 55:01.819
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.

55:01.986 --> 55:03.320
Spit it out.

55:04.905 --> 55:06.698
You're gonna get hurt.

55:11.911 --> 55:13.288
What an idiot.

55:24.381 --> 55:27.092
Why does it always have to be your fight?

55:30.220 --> 55:32.514
- You might need this.
- No.

55:33.181 --> 55:37.518
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.

55:37.810 --> 55:40.020
You and me both, boy.

55:42.815 --> 55:43.899
Chris, listen.

55:45.817 --> 55:47.611
You be careful.

55:49.112 --> 55:50.196
I will.

56:00.497 --> 56:02.791
Please step away from the vehicle!

56:02.916 --> 56:05.794
Mr. Booth, are you still upset
over that body-cavity search?

56:06.003 --> 56:07.879
I forgot, you got no vehicle.

56:12.091 --> 56:14.594
Please disperse! There is nothing to...

56:17.596 --> 56:18.889
Can I talk to you?

56:18.889 --> 56:20.391
- Sure.
- Over here?

56:25.187 --> 56:29.107
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.

56:29.399 --> 56:31.901
Think they're gonna take it that far?

56:40.618 --> 56:43.912
- I'm with you, man. I'll check in later.
- Okay.

56:57.216 --> 57:00.511
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.

57:08.685 --> 57:10.520
You making house calls?

57:15.108 --> 57:16.984
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.

57:21.780 --> 57:24.116
How's the food around here?

57:24.783 --> 57:25.784
Nice.

57:27.994 --> 57:30.080
I brought you special treats:

57:31.706 --> 57:34.500
Salad, fried chicken...

57:36.919 --> 57:38.587
potato salad.

57:39.797 --> 57:41.799
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.

57:52.684 --> 57:55.603
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.

57:58.105 --> 58:00.983
I figured you were making some changes
around here...

58:01.191 --> 58:02.818
I could make a few myself.

58:07.489 --> 58:09.115
Salt and pepper?

59:27.687 --> 59:29.314
- Who is that?
- Pete.

59:29.689 --> 59:32.192
- Want something to eat?
- No. I'm good, man.

59:44.995 --> 59:46.913
I got to get a bigger bed.

59:51.292 --> 59:52.710
No, you don't.

01:00:21.904 --> 01:00:22.905
Do it.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:26.283
I'm hungry.

01:00:27.617 --> 01:00:29.286
We've got leftovers.

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:35.291
I want pancakes. And eggs. And bacon.

01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:52.015
I told you, Vaughn.

01:00:57.895 --> 01:00:59.188
Stay here.

01:01:04.318 --> 01:01:07.487
Who needs to step away
from the vehicle now, Vaughn?

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.909
Truck for a truck, baby!

01:01:13.493 --> 01:01:16.913
That's right! Truck for a truck!

01:01:32.385 --> 01:01:33.594
Get down!

01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:36.681
Tear it up, boys!

01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:49.109
Pete, something's burning.

01:01:58.784 --> 01:02:00.119
Take this.

01:02:01.495 --> 01:02:02.788
Get in there.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.013
Good morning, honey.

01:02:23.515 --> 01:02:24.892
Get out of here.

01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:29.187
Sheriff, are you home?

01:02:31.189 --> 01:02:33.900
I told you someone was going to get hurt!

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:10.892
Come here.

01:03:12.018 --> 01:03:14.312
When I say now, start shooting!

01:03:14.896 --> 01:03:16.189
Over there!

01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:19.984
Stay low.

01:03:20.818 --> 01:03:23.612
Vaughn! You got to get me out of here.

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.117
Move it. Go! Move it, old man.

01:03:29.492 --> 01:03:31.494
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.

01:03:31.995 --> 01:03:33.204
Sit down.

01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:37.583
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:43.213 --> 01:03:46.591
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch. Check it out.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.882
Come on! Get me out of here, man!

01:04:21.716 --> 01:04:24.594
- What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
- Screw you!

01:04:30.307 --> 01:04:34.186
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!

01:04:40.692 --> 01:04:41.818
Drop it.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.113
Stay down!

01:04:49.783 --> 01:04:51.201
Stay down.

01:04:58.208 --> 01:04:59.417
You okay?

01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:08.384
Shit.

01:05:19.102 --> 01:05:22.688
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.

01:05:39.996 --> 01:05:41.414
I'm going in!

01:05:46.794 --> 01:05:48.420
Right there, punk!

01:05:49.797 --> 01:05:52.299
Come on, Chris! Come on!

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.185
Deni, now!

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.505
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

01:07:22.715 --> 01:07:24.008
I'm sorry.

01:07:25.593 --> 01:07:28.095
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.

01:07:33.392 --> 01:07:35.810
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.

01:08:06.797 --> 01:08:08.382
You gonna be okay?

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:43.886
Hey, Chris.

01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.389
Get up, Jay.

01:09:46.514 --> 01:09:48.182
Just a second.

01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:52.019
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek up here?

01:09:56.815 --> 01:09:59.192
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!

01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:03.613
Look, Chris...

01:10:10.619 --> 01:10:13.914
You want to know
what my new favorite sound's gonna be?

01:10:14.206 --> 01:10:17.083
The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.088
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no! You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!

01:10:22.588 --> 01:10:24.882
You forgot this: this is my town!

01:11:18.306 --> 01:11:19.307
Yes!

01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:39.589
You're nothing.

01:12:56.187 --> 01:12:59.399
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.

01:13:00.108 --> 01:13:01.609
This is my town.

01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:05.780
You're under arrest.

01:13:12.286 --> 01:13:13.912
That ought to do it.

01:13:16.998 --> 01:13:18.583
What are you doing?

01:13:18.917 --> 01:13:21.919
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.

01:13:22.587 --> 01:13:24.297
That's how it starts.

01:13:24.505 --> 01:13:28.384
Next you'll be accepting bribes
and setting speed traps all over town.

01:13:28.717 --> 01:13:31.220
Cutting up trucks. You know how you are.

01:13:31.595 --> 01:13:33.889
Not to mention the cavity searches.

01:13:36.182 --> 01:13:37.517
You're gonna like that.

01:13:37.684 --> 01:13:40.603
Speaking of which,
do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?

01:13:40.812 --> 01:13:43.981
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?

01:13:44.607 --> 01:13:47.693
He's probably blowing on
somebody's dice right now.

01:13:50.487 --> 01:13:51.613
That's lunch.

01:13:51.697 --> 01:13:53.907
Let's go pick up my old man,
grab something to eat.

01:13:54.116 --> 01:13:55.784
I'm with you, buddy.
