06:19.377 --> 06:21.311
Pleased to meet you.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.281
Two of the horses run off, but
that pinto you're riding hung around.

06:33.358 --> 06:36.350
You got no idea what
they were after?

06:38.530 --> 06:40.794
Offend anybody lately?

06:40.865 --> 06:42.992
Not for five years.

06:44.669 --> 06:48.230
- Jefferson City?
- No. Leavenworth.

06:48.306 --> 06:50.570
Never been in there.

06:52.310 --> 06:54.278
They jumped you
out of the blue?

06:55.747 --> 06:58.147
I had to get up anyway.

07:02.954 --> 07:05.445
Me, I'm riding along
minding my own business.

07:05.523 --> 07:10.256
Four cowboys come by, and we decide
to ride together. Friendly as can be.

07:10.328 --> 07:14.458
I figure you should approach life like
everybody's your friend or nobody is.

07:14.532 --> 07:16.500
Don't make much difference.

07:16.568 --> 07:20.561
Suddenly everybody's
pointing their gun but me.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.431
Guess they admired my horse.

07:24.509 --> 07:28.343
Looks like that's not all
they admired.

07:28.413 --> 07:32.144
Yep. My whole rig.

07:32.217 --> 07:35.186
I don't care much about the rest...

07:35.253 --> 07:38.620
but I surely will miss
that bay.

07:40.091 --> 07:43.117
At least they didn't kill me.

07:43.194 --> 07:47.221
That was right considerate,
I thought.

07:49.567 --> 07:52.365
They were laughing
when they left me.

07:53.571 --> 07:55.801
Thought it was real funny.

07:57.175 --> 08:01.874
I walked for a little while,
but it was no use so I gave it up.

08:01.646 --> 08:04.615
Figured it was just bad luck.

08:05.717 --> 08:08.185
Looks like those boys
are headed south...

08:08.253 --> 08:10.687
so they weren't the same ones
that jumped me.

08:12.324 --> 08:14.884
Where are you going?

08:14.960 --> 08:17.690
Where's the pinto going?

08:31.009 --> 08:33.500
I'll get these horses tended to.

08:42.654 --> 08:44.815
I'm good for it.

09:17.756 --> 09:20.850
Just a minute. When I'm done
helping the lady, I'll come here...

09:20.926 --> 09:22.985
I'll take this one.

09:24.429 --> 09:27.398
This one is $20.

09:35.006 --> 09:39.409
- How much to borrow it?
- The guns are for sale.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.473
What can I get for that?

10:00.265 --> 10:01.562
Look, Ma!

10:27.492 --> 10:29.687
This is the man, Sergeant.

10:29.761 --> 10:32.321
He claims the animal was stolen.

10:37.168 --> 10:39.500
How do I know
this is your horse?

10:39.571 --> 10:41.801
Can't you see this horse loves me?

10:41.873 --> 10:45.866
I had a gal do that to me.
It didn't make her my wife.

10:45.944 --> 10:49.072
On the underside of that saddle
I got my name scratched.

10:49.147 --> 10:51.240
Take a look and you'll see.

10:52.617 --> 10:56.280
- And what would your name be?
- Paden.

10:59.491 --> 11:01.459
P-A-D-E-N.

11:05.597 --> 11:07.064
Hello, Cobb.

11:09.034 --> 11:10.865
Hello, Paden.

11:10.935 --> 11:12.903
How're you doing?

11:12.971 --> 11:14.871
You know this man?

11:16.408 --> 11:18.137
I surely do.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.579
Troopers, let's take a look
at this saddle.

11:29.788 --> 11:31.779
All right.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.882
Move along, folks.
Get these children out of here.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.555
And you, get some clothes on.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.762
I see you've been prospering
without me.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.504
It's been a while.

11:47.572 --> 11:50.302
Where's the dog?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.981
Appreciate the loan.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.911
I'm good for it.

12:04.989 --> 12:07.753
Let's talk about that.

12:07.826 --> 12:10.090
I'm looking for some men.

12:14.899 --> 12:18.733
- I've given that up.
- So have I.

12:18.803 --> 12:22.933
I've got a legitimate job now.
I could use a guy like you.

12:25.443 --> 12:27.536
You've got a legitimate job?

12:27.612 --> 12:29.944
Yes, sir, you wouldn't believe it.

12:30.014 --> 12:31.675
You're right.

12:33.418 --> 12:36.319
This is mighty sweet, Paden.

12:36.387 --> 12:40.084
I think I finally found my place
in the world.

12:41.025 --> 12:43.357
Well, I'm...

12:43.428 --> 12:45.419
real happy for you, Cobb.

12:47.198 --> 12:50.190
But I think I'll just
keep looking for mine.

12:55.306 --> 12:57.365
He's getting out.

13:02.747 --> 13:05.807
Come on, Paden.
This oughta interest you.

13:15.627 --> 13:18.118
Look who's here, Tyree.

13:24.169 --> 13:27.070
Our old ridin' buddy.

13:33.077 --> 13:36.069
I invited Paden to join us...

13:36.147 --> 13:38.377
but he's not having any.

13:49.427 --> 13:51.395
Where's the dog?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.825
You owe me $13.

14:02.941 --> 14:05.205
Thirteen.

14:05.276 --> 14:07.210
Bad luck.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.514
I see what you like.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.524
She's mighty pretty.

14:20.592 --> 14:23.186
And bridle-wise, too.

14:23.261 --> 14:26.560
The only thing I lost
I really cared about...

14:26.631 --> 14:29.429
except for maybe my hat.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.834
It's a great one.
Black with a pretty silver band on it.

14:33.905 --> 14:36.533
My head spent three years
training it.

14:37.609 --> 14:40.169
Sure do miss that hat.

14:40.245 --> 14:43.146
I got to be going.

14:43.214 --> 14:46.115
Going to Turley, was it?

14:46.184 --> 14:51.588
Yeah. I gotta stop off there,
meet a guy. Head out for Silverado.

14:54.325 --> 14:56.259
What's Turley like?

14:59.030 --> 15:01.191
It's a town.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.792
Got a saloon?

15:04.869 --> 15:06.700
I expect.

15:07.839 --> 15:09.773
Women?

15:09.841 --> 15:11.570
I expect.

16:41.265 --> 16:43.790
Baxter! Hawley!
Where the hell you been?

16:43.868 --> 16:47.235
You're late, and I tell you
I don't like it. It's a bad start.

16:47.305 --> 16:50.741
I got my people down there
throwing snowballs and rearing to go!

16:50.808 --> 16:55.541
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend.
My name ain't Baxter. He ain't Hawley.

16:55.613 --> 16:57.774
- You're not Baxter?
- Name's Emmett.

16:57.849 --> 17:00.249
- You're not Baxter, either?
- No. I'm not Hawley.

17:00.318 --> 17:02.718
Goddamn it!

17:02.787 --> 17:06.780
They ain't Baxter and Hawley!
Where the hell is Baxter and Hawley?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.417
Quit yelling, you old coot.
We're right here.

17:09.493 --> 17:12.156
Who you calling a coot?

17:12.230 --> 17:15.631
Calm down, Mr. Hobart.
I'm Nord Baxter.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.863
- There's my partner, Tom Hawley.
- You're late. It's a bad start.

17:18.935 --> 17:22.497
Yes. That means we'II have to get you
to Silverado that much quicker.

17:22.573 --> 17:24.564
All right. Let's get goin'!

17:24.642 --> 17:28.099
You remember my letter, don't you?
Half now and half when we get there.

17:28.179 --> 17:30.306
I remember.
Open the box.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.015
Thank you.

17:42.093 --> 17:44.584
- Don't you even want to count it?
- Not at all, friend.

17:44.662 --> 17:46.596
We trust you.

17:47.598 --> 17:50.032
Let's get this wagon train
to Silverado.

17:50.101 --> 17:51.796
You bet!

18:29.173 --> 18:31.107
What do you want?

18:31.175 --> 18:35.305
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.

18:36.981 --> 18:38.915
Give me a bottle.

18:54.999 --> 18:58.230
Hey, what are you doing, buck?

18:59.303 --> 19:01.271
Having a drink.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.871
No, you're not.
Get outta here.

19:11.482 --> 19:17.352
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.

19:17.421 --> 19:20.390
You ain't gettin' it here.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.824
I'm real sorry to hear that.

19:25.096 --> 19:28.395
- Doesn't look quite fair.
- Which way do you mean?

19:54.725 --> 19:56.659
What's all this then?

20:00.198 --> 20:03.497
This nigger's breaking up my place,
Sheriff Langston.

20:03.568 --> 20:06.230
I don't like that word much,
Carter.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.137
We don't serve them here
and you know it.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.233
I asked him to leave
and he went crazy on us!

20:12.310 --> 20:16.269
- Now he owes me money for this damage.
- Is that a fact?

20:16.347 --> 20:20.477
Afraid not, Sheriff.
These other fellas started the ruckus.

20:20.551 --> 20:23.384
Are these your friends?

20:23.454 --> 20:25.922
I wanted a drink and a bed.

20:25.990 --> 20:28.925
- Guess I came to the wrong place.
- Came to the wrong town.

20:28.993 --> 20:34.556
I don't tolerate this. It's hard
on the peace and the furniture.

20:34.632 --> 20:40.195
Knowing a bit about Carter, I'll let
you go without paying for the damage.

20:40.271 --> 20:43.365
But go you will,
and I mean now.

20:44.542 --> 20:48.308
Is there a place in town
that takes my kind?

20:48.379 --> 20:50.609
You misunderstand.
I want you out of town.

20:50.681 --> 20:53.844
In fact, I want you all the way
out of my jurisdiction.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.953
That ain't right.

20:57.021 --> 21:01.890
I decide what's right
in this jurisdiction. Now move.

21:56.414 --> 21:58.780
Who's gonna pay for this, Sheriff?

22:00.384 --> 22:02.852
Don't press your luck, Carter.

22:12.196 --> 22:14.790
Now, let's talk about you chaps.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.597
- We'd rather stay.
- We'll see about that.

22:19.670 --> 22:22.662
I'm Sheriff John Langston.

22:22.740 --> 22:25.140
As you may have guessed,
I am not from these parts.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.771
You're kidding?

22:28.846 --> 22:31.872
But the good citizens of Turley
have taken me in their embrace...

22:31.949 --> 22:35.316
and for one simple reason:
I maintain the peace.

22:35.386 --> 22:39.288
So, when strangers come to town,
I always ask them their business.

22:40.591 --> 22:43.526
Have you come for the hanging?

22:43.594 --> 22:46.085
I'm just meeting a guy here
and moving on.

22:46.163 --> 22:48.358
So far I haven't been able
to find him.

22:48.432 --> 22:51.731
In my town, if you're looking
for someone, you ask me.

22:51.802 --> 22:55.898
All right. He's a young fella,
full of juice, about my size...

22:55.973 --> 22:57.941
wears a fancy two-gun rig.

23:03.948 --> 23:06.940
I know where that gentleman is.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.921
I want everyone to behave himself.

23:14.725 --> 23:16.158
Emmett?

23:18.529 --> 23:19.962
Howdy, Jake.

23:20.030 --> 23:23.124
I'm glad to see you!

23:23.200 --> 23:24.724
Keep back.

23:26.003 --> 23:28.062
- Thank you.
- What's going on here?

23:28.139 --> 23:32.166
You got me!
This is a crazy town.

23:32.243 --> 23:35.076
I think we ought to just
get out of here.

23:36.213 --> 23:38.204
All I did was kiss a girl.

23:38.282 --> 23:42.241
- That's why they got you in jail?
- Yeah, I kissed a girl.

23:42.319 --> 23:45.379
This guy didn't like it...

23:45.456 --> 23:49.051
so we had some words
so I decided to get outta there.

23:50.161 --> 23:52.823
So I did!
I got out of there.

23:52.897 --> 23:55.297
You know me.
I don't want no trouble.

23:55.366 --> 23:58.358
So I walked out into the street.

23:58.436 --> 24:02.236
- He tries to shoot me in the back.
- You had to kill him?

24:02.306 --> 24:05.207
No, I winged him
and he dropped his gun.

24:05.276 --> 24:07.506
You're in here for winging a guy?

24:09.013 --> 24:13.575
No, not exactly, because then
his friend opened up on me.

24:13.651 --> 24:16.176
- What friend's that?
- The one with the shotgun.

24:16.253 --> 24:18.312
The dead one.

24:23.194 --> 24:26.095
Jake. Jake!

24:26.163 --> 24:30.725
I'm gonna ask you once.
Was it self-defense?

24:33.537 --> 24:36.199
Honest to God,
he would've killed me.

24:38.943 --> 24:41.434
The jury saw it differently.

24:42.646 --> 24:46.412
- He's the guy you're gonna hang?
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.748
I was afraid of that.

24:50.855 --> 24:53.380
Emmett, can't you help me?

24:53.457 --> 24:57.052
You know the law, Jake.
You know what they did to me.

25:00.998 --> 25:03.796
Blind Pete always said you'd hang.

25:06.737 --> 25:10.264
I guess tomorrow at dawn,
he'll be proved right.

25:10.341 --> 25:12.366
10:00 a.m.

25:12.443 --> 25:15.435
Right. I always thought
they did it at dawn.

25:17.147 --> 25:20.378
So long, kid.
I'm sorry.

25:30.494 --> 25:34.260
I hate to see any man swing.
It's bad luck.

25:34.331 --> 25:38.529
Bad luck for me.
I gotta bust him outta there.

25:43.941 --> 25:47.536
You'll have to deal me out
on that.

25:47.611 --> 25:51.877
I've had some experience
with that sort of thing.

25:51.949 --> 25:55.112
- I don't want any more.
- I understand.

25:58.455 --> 26:03.085
- It's not going to be easy.
- It never is.

26:06.096 --> 26:08.428
But he's my brother.

26:08.499 --> 26:10.467
We're going to California together...

26:10.534 --> 26:14.937
but first we're stopping off in
Silverado, see our sister, say good-bye.

26:16.273 --> 26:18.798
I can't show up there
with a story like this.

26:20.244 --> 26:22.712
I guess this is where
we part ways.

26:25.015 --> 26:29.384
- Sorry.
- No hard feelings.

26:31.021 --> 26:33.512
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

26:34.458 --> 26:37.154
You ain't got any money.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.627
You buy me a drink.

26:41.765 --> 26:45.201
You know, a good, smelly saloon...

26:45.269 --> 26:48.238
is my favorite place in the world.

27:36.553 --> 27:38.578
You're wearing my hat.

27:40.024 --> 27:42.686
What else you got that's mine?

27:42.760 --> 27:45.354
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:53.871 --> 27:57.739
I hope your fingers aren't tickling
my ivory-handled colt.

28:05.282 --> 28:09.275
If you stand up slow and let me see,
you might live through this night.

28:18.595 --> 28:20.290
Sure.

28:35.512 --> 28:38.743
You're making a big mistake.

28:38.816 --> 28:41.307
That's what I told 'em.

28:59.703 --> 29:03.571
You mean you ain't coming
with Emmett and me?

29:03.640 --> 29:05.972
I can't say I'm convinced
you're going anywhere.

29:06.043 --> 29:08.773
We sure are!
We're leaving at dawn.

29:14.351 --> 29:16.717
I have no reason to run.

29:16.787 --> 29:19.950
It was a fair fight
and there were plenty of witnesses.

29:20.023 --> 29:22.787
Yeah, that's what happened
with me, too.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.294
The other guy drew first.

29:26.296 --> 29:28.161
Right.

29:47.251 --> 29:49.446
Sheriff, open up!

29:52.990 --> 29:55.356
Sheriff Langston, come quick!

29:56.627 --> 29:59.460
Lock the door.
Don't let anybody in.

30:10.541 --> 30:13.635
Blind Pete used to do this
all by...

30:13.710 --> 30:15.337
touch.

30:35.065 --> 30:37.659
All right, where is he?

30:38.836 --> 30:40.804
- He left.
- Like hell!

30:40.871 --> 30:43.396
This is the only way out.

30:45.108 --> 30:47.906
I woke up and he was gone.

30:52.282 --> 30:56.582
All right, kid, come on out.
I know you're under there.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.413
You, get over here.

31:01.692 --> 31:04.058
Yeah, you, get over here.

31:05.596 --> 31:07.655
Gimme your hands.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.341
Did you get him?

31:32.456 --> 31:35.357
Thanks for giving me a hand.

32:05.789 --> 32:07.381
What now?

32:08.825 --> 32:10.258
We wait.

32:10.327 --> 32:11.885
Let's go.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.628
Come on, Jake, let's go!

34:08.678 --> 34:11.168
Get 'em at the river.

35:06.903 --> 35:09.394
Here's a trick for you, kid.

35:17.848 --> 35:21.045
- That them shooting?
- No, it's coming from those rocks.

35:22.652 --> 35:27.589
- Let's go. He ain't hitting nothing.
- He's hit everything he's aimed at.

35:27.657 --> 35:30.558
They won't be out of our jurisdiction
until they pass Flat Top.

35:34.898 --> 35:37.992
Today my jurisdiction
ends here.

35:39.503 --> 35:41.664
Pick up my hat.

35:41.738 --> 35:43.899
Hey, Langston!

35:45.175 --> 35:46.938
10:00!

35:57.087 --> 35:59.851
This a friend of yours?

35:59.923 --> 36:01.857
He is now.

36:01.925 --> 36:03.358
Who is he?

36:03.426 --> 36:07.760
- A guy who got run out of town.
- Just like us.

37:29.646 --> 37:31.773
Hobart, what are you people
doing here?

37:31.848 --> 37:33.509
Look.

37:33.583 --> 37:37.679
Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb
and stole the money box.

37:42.826 --> 37:45.056
They went north.
We're going after 'em.

37:45.128 --> 37:48.393
Forget the money.
You gotta get these people outta here.

37:50.133 --> 37:52.067
This is bad country.

37:52.135 --> 37:55.036
No place to be setting
with women and kids.

37:55.105 --> 37:59.735
- The next water ain't for three days.
- We got no life without that money.

37:59.809 --> 38:03.301
Everybody put in.
That's our whole stake!

38:06.082 --> 38:09.210
- How long they been gone?
- About an hour.

38:17.427 --> 38:20.260
I'll go with you, Mal.

38:28.204 --> 38:30.138
Deal me in.

38:35.278 --> 38:38.736
Jake, you know the way outta here.

38:38.815 --> 38:42.979
Get this train moving to Silverado fast.
I'll go with these guys.

38:43.053 --> 38:46.614
You men, stay with your wagons
and your families.

38:46.690 --> 38:50.091
- Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled.
- Wait a minute.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.620
Even if you do get the money,
how do we know you'II come back?

38:55.865 --> 38:59.562
If we don't,
you can keep my brother.

38:59.636 --> 39:01.570
I'm trusting you, mister.

39:01.638 --> 39:03.765
You trusted Baxter.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.241
I don't plan on letting these men
out of my sight.

39:07.310 --> 39:11.644
If I brought a pretty lady like that
into a place like this, I'd stay close.

39:11.715 --> 39:13.910
That's none of your business.

39:13.983 --> 39:16.781
Let's get going.

39:26.730 --> 39:30.928
You got a point.
Maybe I better stay here with her.

39:46.349 --> 39:49.944
Let's get turned around
and get these wagons rolling!

39:50.019 --> 39:53.955
Everybody rides! Everybody rides!

40:16.279 --> 40:20.010
Hanging around with you is no picnic.

40:22.986 --> 40:25.955
Anybody got any ideas?

40:27.624 --> 40:30.388
You really did it this time, Nord.

40:30.460 --> 40:33.429
Thank you, boss.
Tom did his part, too.

40:39.936 --> 40:41.369
Comin' in!

40:57.554 --> 40:59.681
- Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?
- In a minute.

40:59.756 --> 41:03.157
I wouldn't do that. You're gonna need
every gun when that posse gets here.

41:03.226 --> 41:05.421
Posse? What the hell
are you talking about?

41:05.495 --> 41:09.158
Me and my partner robbed a bank. We
headed out with a posse on our tails.

41:09.232 --> 41:12.827
My partner caught one. He kicked off
while I was looking for this canyon.

41:12.902 --> 41:17.100
You're Dawson, ain't you? Tex LaRue.
I rode with Ry Morris. You know him.

41:17.173 --> 41:21.405
Simms told me there's a hideout here
so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.

41:21.478 --> 41:23.878
Mind?

41:23.947 --> 41:29.408
You brought a posse to my best hideout
and you ask me if I mind?

41:29.486 --> 41:33.786
Mister, I don't know
any of those names.

41:33.857 --> 41:35.791
You're about to die.

41:35.859 --> 41:39.317
Hold on! You don't believe me,
ask them two there.

41:39.395 --> 41:42.523
They saw me and my pal in Turley
before we did the job.

41:42.599 --> 41:46.899
I seen him there all right.
Don't know nothing about any bank job.

41:49.572 --> 41:53.804
If you took the bank in Turley,
where's the money?

41:55.078 --> 41:58.411
I'd get down if I were you.
They might be up there right now.

41:59.382 --> 42:01.475
- No money, huh?
- It's in my saddlebags.

42:01.551 --> 42:04.486
I ain't getting out in the open
to get it.

42:30.947 --> 42:33.541
Stop your firin'...

42:33.616 --> 42:36.210
until you see something.

42:37.453 --> 42:41.184
If we charge them, they won't stand
a chance. We gotta get to the horses!

42:41.257 --> 42:44.158
- Horses? What're you talking about?
- Cover me!

43:03.112 --> 43:04.739
Brave man.

43:04.814 --> 43:09.217
I think there's only a couple of guys
up there and this asshole's one of 'em.

43:19.963 --> 43:23.399
Get that guy!
Keep him from getting the horses!

44:14.250 --> 44:17.981
That was some idea of yours.
Next time you go in.

44:19.155 --> 44:23.615
I knew it!
Put that box on my horse.

44:29.332 --> 44:31.766
Mister, you got a lot to learn
about people.

45:02.899 --> 45:07.029
They got a place south of Silverado.
Guess they've done okay.

45:07.103 --> 45:09.867
Good enough, anyway,
so when my mama wrote me last time...

45:09.939 --> 45:13.841
she said they needed my help
to work the place.

45:13.910 --> 45:17.038
That was almost nine months ago
she wrote.

45:17.113 --> 45:21.277
Letter took a while to find me, but
when it did it was just the right time.

45:22.585 --> 45:24.018
Where were you?

45:25.655 --> 45:29.523
Chicago. Working
in the slaughterhouses.

45:29.592 --> 45:32.459
Chicago?
You've been to Chicago?

45:34.864 --> 45:36.923
Was it wonderful?

45:41.437 --> 45:43.735
Hey, Paden...

45:43.806 --> 45:45.740
where you been?

45:46.809 --> 45:48.606
I was just...

45:48.678 --> 45:50.612
checking the...

45:51.614 --> 45:53.548
You know, looking in.

45:59.889 --> 46:03.086
Geez, Paden, her old man
ain't even cold yet.

46:20.109 --> 46:23.010
Looks pretty shallow here.
We could just go off.

46:35.491 --> 46:38.426
Pull 'em up. Yeah.

46:47.270 --> 46:49.204
That's all right
Let 'em go.

46:49.272 --> 46:52.139
The bank is soft on the other side.

47:05.922 --> 47:08.254
Let's go.

47:34.617 --> 47:37.552
Well, this is it, gents.

47:37.620 --> 47:41.386
My mama told me
to head through that notch.

47:41.457 --> 47:43.288
Good luck, Mal.

47:43.359 --> 47:45.850
Maybe we'll see you around sometime.

47:45.928 --> 47:47.418
Yeah, maybe.

47:48.497 --> 47:49.987
So long.

47:56.305 --> 47:58.739
- So long, Mal!
- Bye.

48:14.991 --> 48:20.190
- Hope to see you again, ma'am.
- I'll ride along with the lady.

48:21.864 --> 48:26.164
Take a look at this farmland
before I come into Silverado.

48:26.235 --> 48:29.432
See what makes a trip this hard
worth taking.

48:31.574 --> 48:33.508
I'll see you around.

48:33.576 --> 48:36.511
I'll be around.
Jake, let's go!

48:51.193 --> 48:53.457
See you in Silverado, Paden!

48:53.529 --> 48:55.793
I'll be there.

49:57.793 --> 50:01.388
Mr. And Mrs. Parker have agreed
to join their parcel to mine.

50:01.464 --> 50:04.058
We'll work them together.

50:04.133 --> 50:06.533
Mine starts right over there.

50:07.737 --> 50:09.864
It's all I've ever wanted.

50:11.073 --> 50:13.268
Pretty land, isn't it?

50:13.342 --> 50:15.367
And a pretty lady.

50:16.846 --> 50:20.373
A lot of men have told me that.

50:20.449 --> 50:23.247
Maybe it's true.

50:23.319 --> 50:26.846
I guess some women are slow
to believe it.

50:26.922 --> 50:28.787
Believe it.

50:30.393 --> 50:33.726
They're drawn to me by that,
but it never lasts.

50:33.796 --> 50:35.491
Why?

50:35.564 --> 50:38.761
Because they don't like
what I want.

50:38.834 --> 50:40.802
What's that?

50:40.870 --> 50:43.065
I want to build something.

50:43.139 --> 50:45.073
Make things grow.

50:45.141 --> 50:49.441
That takes hard work.
A lifetime of it.

50:49.512 --> 50:53.107
That's not why a man comes
to a pretty woman.

50:55.551 --> 50:59.112
After a while,
I won't be so pretty...

50:59.188 --> 51:01.656
but this land will be.

51:13.636 --> 51:15.160
Come here.

51:21.210 --> 51:24.304
- Hi, J.T.
- Jake, how are you?

51:24.380 --> 51:26.348
Come on, son.

51:30.152 --> 51:32.177
You remember us?

51:32.254 --> 51:33.778
Yeah.

51:35.224 --> 51:36.987
Hi, Augie.

51:47.603 --> 51:50.868
It's good to be home, Kate.

52:26.675 --> 52:28.233
Daddy?

52:29.912 --> 52:32.642
I saw the light.

52:32.715 --> 52:36.481
I thought maybe Rae
had come back to see me.

52:36.552 --> 52:40.886
I never thought it'd be my boy.
I never thought that!

52:41.891 --> 52:43.916
Mama?

52:43.993 --> 52:46.826
She was sick a long time.

52:48.764 --> 52:51.528
She was sick when she wrote you.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.091
But she didn't say it.

52:54.170 --> 52:59.369
I never thought you'd come back,
but she did.

52:59.441 --> 53:04.174
- Where's Rae?
- She's gone. Gone to town.

53:04.246 --> 53:07.579
She hated working the farm...

53:07.650 --> 53:09.811
just like you.

53:09.885 --> 53:11.614
What happened?

53:11.687 --> 53:13.678
They run me off.

53:13.756 --> 53:16.554
They burned me out!

53:16.625 --> 53:19.526
Made it so I couldn't do...

53:21.096 --> 53:23.155
just like Georgia!

53:23.232 --> 53:25.166
You own this land.

53:25.234 --> 53:29.295
I paid the government for it.
That don't mean much out here.

53:29.371 --> 53:34.900
Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat
in a cave in them hills.

53:35.978 --> 53:38.139
Hidin' out.

53:38.214 --> 53:42.241
- Afraid to walk my own land.
- What about the law?

53:42.318 --> 53:46.982
Whose law? The law here runs a man down
just like these cattle.

53:48.958 --> 53:51.017
That ain't right.

53:52.061 --> 53:54.757
I had enough of what ain't right.

53:55.898 --> 53:58.958
What we got here is a bad situation.

53:59.034 --> 54:01.764
Those homesteaders you brought in
are gonna make it worse.

54:01.837 --> 54:05.534
When they come to stake their claims,
it's gonna be the start of big trouble.

54:05.608 --> 54:07.633
Gonna cut McKendrick off
in the north.

54:07.710 --> 54:13.012
A man could die of thirst before anybody
offered him a drink around here.

54:16.785 --> 54:19.652
Maybe you oughta come to California
with Jake and me.

54:22.358 --> 54:24.724
Augie's gonna grow up here.

54:24.793 --> 54:27.887
There's nothing wrong with the land.
It's just some of the people.

54:27.963 --> 54:31.490
The problem is, Emmett,
you killed the wrong McKendrick.

54:32.635 --> 54:36.731
Watch what you're saying around Augie.
Emmett didn't kill anybody.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.700
Well, it was self-defense
sure enough.

54:40.776 --> 54:43.973
But I do think you'd have to say
I killed old Murdo.

54:44.046 --> 54:46.378
I think that's definitely the word.

54:46.448 --> 54:51.715
The son is worse than the old man. He's
smoother so you don't hear him coming.

54:51.787 --> 54:53.846
He'll do anything
to keep his range free.

54:53.922 --> 54:58.916
I'm worried what he's gonna do
when he finds out you boys are back.

54:58.994 --> 55:02.122
I think Jake here
can take care of himself.

55:02.197 --> 55:05.064
I just did five years
I didn't owe.

55:05.134 --> 55:09.264
McKendrick oughta be satisfied with that
and let it lie.

55:13.776 --> 55:16.574
What brings you out of your hole,
Johnson?

55:18.213 --> 55:20.204
Who's that with you, Ezra?

55:20.282 --> 55:24.275
This is my son.
He's come home.

55:24.353 --> 55:28.653
Ain't that sweet, Red?

55:29.725 --> 55:34.753
- You're trespassing on McKendrick land.
- You got it all wrong, mister.

55:34.830 --> 55:37.628
- This is our place.
- What?

55:37.700 --> 55:40.464
Mr. McKendrick bought this place
from your father.

55:40.536 --> 55:42.868
That's a lie!

55:42.938 --> 55:46.499
Tomorrow we're going to town and
straighten that out once and for all.

55:46.575 --> 55:49.703
The next day we'll be back here
farming.

55:49.778 --> 55:52.303
And them cattle better be gone.

55:52.381 --> 55:57.546
If I find any cattle
on our land after tomorrow...

55:57.619 --> 56:00.179
I'm gonna start carving 'em
into steaks.

56:00.255 --> 56:03.281
And believe me,
that's one thing I know about.

56:03.359 --> 56:08.023
Killing cattle is a hanging offense
in these parts.

56:08.097 --> 56:12.397
If we shot you down right now,
we'd be within our rights.

56:12.468 --> 56:16.598
You ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
in the hands of an expert?

56:16.672 --> 56:20.073
Who would that be? You?

56:26.615 --> 56:29.015
This ain't the end of it.

57:26.942 --> 57:29.604
What can I do you for, stranger?

57:33.315 --> 57:36.250
- You work here?
- I run the place.

57:36.318 --> 57:39.082
- What can I get you?
- Bourbon.

57:39.154 --> 57:40.712
Right.

57:53.469 --> 57:54.993
Nifty.

57:55.070 --> 58:00.201
The world is what you make of it.
If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.

58:00.275 --> 58:04.006
I'll drink to that.
Will you join me, Miss...

58:04.079 --> 58:06.104
Stella.

58:06.181 --> 58:08.206
Paden.

58:14.022 --> 58:15.455
Stella.

58:15.524 --> 58:18.254
Are you the Midnight Star herself?

58:19.261 --> 58:24.096
I am. I'm always there,
but I only shine at night.

58:30.739 --> 58:32.866
Compliments to you, Miss Stella.

58:32.941 --> 58:35.501
This is what I call a saloon.

58:35.577 --> 58:38.341
Thanks. That's what I call it, too.

58:38.413 --> 58:41.940
- And I know what I'm talking about.
- You like a good saloon?

58:42.017 --> 58:44.178
It's the only place I'm happy.

58:44.253 --> 58:48.485
Me, too!
What's wrong with us?

58:51.126 --> 58:54.653
You wouldn't be needing any help
around here, say, with the gambling?

58:56.098 --> 59:00.865
See that fellow playing with his hair?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner.

59:00.936 --> 59:04.633
- He runs that side.
- So-called?

59:04.706 --> 59:08.039
Yeah. Apart from being
a loudmouthed, lying cheat...

59:08.110 --> 59:10.544
he's just the man
I would've picked.

59:10.612 --> 59:13.581
- Why'd you go into business with him?
- I don't own this place.

59:13.649 --> 59:16.948
The man who does,
stuck me with Kelly.

59:17.019 --> 59:20.785
- Who's the owner?
- Here he comes right now.

59:34.403 --> 59:37.133
Well, look at this.

59:37.205 --> 59:40.936
Two of my favorite people
in the world talking to each other.

59:43.912 --> 59:48.815
Stella, this is one of my oldest
surviving friends.

59:48.884 --> 59:52.513
- Treat him right.
- That was my plan.

59:52.588 --> 59:56.524
You two are gonna get along just fine.
You got a lot in common. Kelly!

59:56.592 --> 59:58.822
Get over here.

59:58.894 --> 01:00:02.625
You didn't come all this way just
to pay me back that money, did you?

01:00:03.765 --> 01:00:06.529
- Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
- Howdy.

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:11.096
Give the man a line of credit.
He already owes the house 13 bucks.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:18.770
- You got a place to stay?
- I just got into town.

01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:23.841
- We still got that extra room out back?
- It's not in use at the moment.

01:00:26.822 --> 01:00:29.950
What brings you to my saloon?

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:31.959
Luck, I guess.

01:00:33.562 --> 01:00:35.757
Good old Paden.

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:39.062
I was hoping maybe you'd changed
your mind about the job.

01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:42.468
You didn't tell me
you owned a saloon.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.176
That ain't the half of it, friend.

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:51.235
Welcome to heaven.

01:01:27.482 --> 01:01:30.178
Where's the other one, Johnson?

01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:33.744
Our orders are to run you two
out of here.

01:01:40.462 --> 01:01:43.260
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, old man?

01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:47.996
You tell us where your son is.
There don't have to be any shooting.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:52.131
You're lying, Hoyt,
like always!

01:01:52.207 --> 01:01:54.971
Not this time.
I got my orders.

01:01:55.043 --> 01:01:57.273
My son's on the way to town.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.414
That's too bad.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:04.117
You're just gonna have to go
by yourself.

01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:16.329
Daddy?

01:03:22.197 --> 01:03:26.258
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman.

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:30.532
- But she's got a hard idea for living.
- Yeah?

01:03:31.973 --> 01:03:35.568
All I'm saying is you won't trip over me
if you look her up.

01:03:35.644 --> 01:03:38.272
I'm going to California
with my brother.

01:03:39.347 --> 01:03:43.943
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
He's a friend of mine.

01:03:44.019 --> 01:03:47.386
- This is Sheriff Cobb.
- Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

01:03:47.455 --> 01:03:51.255
The pleasure's mine. Always happy
to meet a friend of Paden's.

01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:53.760
Stella, bring Kelly out here,
will you?

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:58.322
Aren't you Kate Hollis' brother?

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.833
That's right.

01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:04.827
You're the one who killed
old Murdo McKendrick.

01:04:06.908 --> 01:04:10.139
I didn't have much choice. He was about
to shoot my brother in the back.

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:15.144
Can't be having that now, can we?

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:19.677
Wanna see me?

01:04:19.754 --> 01:04:24.282
Kelly, we're gonna make
an adjustment.

01:04:24.359 --> 01:04:27.624
I wanted you to be here
when I offered Paden your job.

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:30.824
I think he could do it
without getting greedy.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.427
Stella and I are tired of you
skimming our profits.

01:04:36.504 --> 01:04:41.066
- What are you talking about?
- I'm done talking. Get out.

01:04:41.142 --> 01:04:44.270
- You can't do this.
- Really?

01:05:00.729 --> 01:05:02.663
Want the job?

01:05:03.765 --> 01:05:05.733
I see you're an understanding boss.

01:05:07.469 --> 01:05:10.199
Nothing like that
would ever happen between us.

01:05:12.774 --> 01:05:15.971
Maybe we oughta ask Stella?

01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:20.715
You'd be welcome.

01:05:20.782 --> 01:05:23.546
No, Kelly, he'll kill you!

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:33.755
Thanks for warning me.

01:05:44.472 --> 01:05:48.101
Didn't have much choice.

01:06:00.822 --> 01:06:03.222
All right, stand back.

01:06:13.268 --> 01:06:16.294
I never enjoy killing a man.

01:06:30.218 --> 01:06:34.450
Excuse me. Sheriff, I'm a gambler
who'd like to run an honest game here.

01:06:34.522 --> 01:06:38.788
To whom do I speak about that?
I hope it's not this gentleman.

01:06:46.334 --> 01:06:48.359
That's him.

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:53.137
I better find somebody
to clean up this mess.

01:06:57.612 --> 01:07:00.877
You used to ride with that guy?

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:14.860
What are you doing?

01:07:14.929 --> 01:07:18.365
I told you to practice on a horse
that's not moving, huh?

01:07:24.506 --> 01:07:26.906
Where are you going?

01:07:26.975 --> 01:07:30.138
I got things to do, kid.
I'm a busy man.

01:07:30.211 --> 01:07:32.475
I'll go with you.

01:07:32.547 --> 01:07:37.450
A grown man can't have a little boy
with him everywhere he goes.

01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:39.817
Who's a grown man?

01:07:50.732 --> 01:07:52.495
Hello, Rae.

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:02.538
What are you doing here?
I thought you were done with our family.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.635
Daddy's dead.

01:08:09.184 --> 01:08:11.778
He was murdered.

01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:13.411
Who did it?

01:08:13.488 --> 01:08:17.584
I'm not sure, but I've got an idea.
When I'm sure, they gonna pay.

01:08:18.693 --> 01:08:20.752
That's just fine.

01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:24.229
Where were you when Mama and Daddy
needed you? It's too late, Mal.

01:08:24.299 --> 01:08:29.202
Now you finally show up, and all you
can think is to get yourself killed.

01:08:34.776 --> 01:08:38.143
- You okay, Rae?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:08:39.581 --> 01:08:41.707
Introduce me to your friend.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:45.617
He's not my friend.
He used to be my brother.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:52.215
Calvin Stanhope.
But my mother called me "Slick."

01:08:55.964 --> 01:08:57.693
Excuse me.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.902
- Why are you here? This ain't for you.
- That's none of your business.

01:09:08.443 --> 01:09:12.435
Rae, all we got is each other.

01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:16.550
I don't have any family anymore.

01:09:44.645 --> 01:09:47.240
I'm surprised to see you
out here today.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:53.586
Just come out to say good-bye.

01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:55.384
Good-bye?

01:09:55.456 --> 01:10:00.189
Yeah. Jake and me will be heading out
for California soon.

01:10:01.629 --> 01:10:05.725
You came all the way out here just
to tell me you're going to California?

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.429
All you had to do was go.
We'd never see each other again.

01:10:09.504 --> 01:10:13.099
- That's why I'm here.
- Why?

01:10:14.676 --> 01:10:16.974
You don't make it easy on a fella.

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:23.476
Maybe you thought
you'd be back this way someday.

01:10:26.254 --> 01:10:27.687
Yeah.

01:10:28.656 --> 01:10:31.124
That must've been it.

01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:42.661
It's McKendrick's men!

01:11:32.587 --> 01:11:33.952
Move!

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.235
All right, let's go!

01:12:01.015 --> 01:12:04.951
Goddamn it! We won't quit!
You bastards!

01:12:13.394 --> 01:12:15.328
Is that a fair mix?

01:12:15.396 --> 01:12:19.924
I'm saving lives here. Straight stuff
would raise a blister on boot leather.

01:12:20.935 --> 01:12:23.529
I meant it seemed like
a lot of whiskey.

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.535
- What's this?
- That's the good stuff.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.840
Yeah? How good?

01:12:45.226 --> 01:12:49.128
- Here's to the good stuff.
- May it last a long time.

01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:54.367
You better get out here.

01:12:57.372 --> 01:13:01.103
- Nothing happened. This is my job.
- Shut up.

01:13:01.175 --> 01:13:05.441
I don't believe a lady has to explain
anything to a man this ugly.

01:13:10.184 --> 01:13:12.516
What's the trouble here?

01:13:12.587 --> 01:13:14.521
Stay out of this, Paden.

01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:17.786
He can't do that.
Cobb's hired him.

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:20.293
That's Cobb's mistake.

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:22.659
Come out of there, Phoebe.
You've done enough.

01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:33.206
Go home.

01:13:34.142 --> 01:13:36.542
All I did was kiss the girl.

01:13:37.812 --> 01:13:41.213
That's what you said in Turley.
Remember how that ended?

01:13:42.617 --> 01:13:46.246
What's the matter? You afraid
I couldn't get those two behind me?

01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:50.189
I don't want you gettin' anybody
in my place.

01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.464
Boom.

01:14:04.539 --> 01:14:06.769
I should've killed you
a long time ago.

01:14:09.911 --> 01:14:11.845
Why not now?

01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:23.555
Don't do it, Tyree.

01:14:23.624 --> 01:14:27.583
I just lost a partner. If you kill him,
I'll never get anyone to work in here.

01:14:28.896 --> 01:14:30.955
You better start lookin'.

01:14:57.325 --> 01:15:00.055
You really are a gambler, aren't you?

01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:10.770
Give me some of the good stuff.

01:15:23.818 --> 01:15:26.616
Whoa! Hold it.
Sorry about that.

01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:32.824
- Where'd you get this horse?
- This is my uncle's horse.

01:15:32.894 --> 01:15:36.455
- Like hell it is.
- What's the problem, Swann?

01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:41.159
Yeah.
What's the problem?

01:15:46.874 --> 01:15:48.307
Emmett.

01:15:48.943 --> 01:15:50.376
McKendrick.

01:15:59.287 --> 01:16:01.312
I didn't know you were out.

01:16:01.389 --> 01:16:03.448
Seem short to you?

01:16:04.325 --> 01:16:08.056
That's all over with as far
as I'm concerned. I'm satisfied.

01:16:08.129 --> 01:16:10.222
Sounds good.

01:16:10.298 --> 01:16:13.825
All right, then.
Let's go.

01:16:15.937 --> 01:16:18.167
- Don't you recognize this pinto?
- What?

01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:20.969
- That's Lee's horse.
- Shut up, Swann.

01:16:22.376 --> 01:16:24.640
Wait a minute.

01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:28.874
Get down from there, Augie.

01:16:55.376 --> 01:16:58.402
The man who lost this horse
must've been working for you.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.405
I should've known.

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:04.680
You changed your brand, Ethan.

01:17:04.752 --> 01:17:08.848
A lot of things changed
when my father died.

01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:43.987
- He must be pretty good.
- He's good, all right.

01:17:44.058 --> 01:17:46.356
Too good for my men.

01:17:46.427 --> 01:17:48.895
That's why you've
gotta take care of it.

01:17:50.197 --> 01:17:53.997
- What about his brother?
- We'II handle that.

01:17:54.068 --> 01:17:56.127
He's careless.

01:17:58.005 --> 01:17:59.996
Things are gettin' messy around here.

01:18:02.076 --> 01:18:04.544
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.

01:18:04.612 --> 01:18:06.546
I heard that, too.

01:18:07.782 --> 01:18:09.943
Did you hear his son
is still around?

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:17.279
Cobb, looks like you're finally
gonna earn your money.

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:26.293
From what I've seen,
Paden doesn't care about money.

01:18:26.367 --> 01:18:28.392
He says he doesn't care about anything,
but he does.

01:18:28.469 --> 01:18:30.801
There's just no tellin'
what it's gonna be.

01:18:30.871 --> 01:18:32.805
Howdy, Mr. Slick.

01:18:32.873 --> 01:18:35.774
Let me tell you
about your friend Paden.

01:18:35.843 --> 01:18:38.641
Me, him, Tyree and a few others...

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:41.273
did a good bit of riding together
a few years back.

01:18:41.348 --> 01:18:45.375
Business was pretty good.

01:18:45.453 --> 01:18:49.822
We were movin' around a lot the way you
have to in that line of work.

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.984
Somewhere along the line
we picked up this dog.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:57.019
One of the boys took to feedin' it,
so it followed us everywhere.

01:18:57.098 --> 01:19:00.226
One time we were leaving
a little Missouri town...

01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:03.793
with a bunch of locals
hot on our tail.

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:07.739
This dog got tangled up
with Tyree's horse.

01:19:07.808 --> 01:19:09.833
Tyree went flyin'.

01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:15.779
Tyree was mad, and being Tyree...

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:17.875
he shot the dog.

01:19:17.952 --> 01:19:20.011
He didn't kill him, though.

01:19:20.087 --> 01:19:23.147
Before you know it,
Paden is off his horse...

01:19:23.224 --> 01:19:25.351
and he's holding this dog.

01:19:25.426 --> 01:19:28.657
He got strange,
said we should go on without him.

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:31.698
I thought he was kidding,
but he wasn't.

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:35.532
Tyree was ready to plug 'em both.
All this with a posse after us.

01:19:37.838 --> 01:19:41.604
I thought we were pals
after all the ridin' we'd done together.

01:19:41.675 --> 01:19:44.735
All of a sudden he's worried
about some mutt.

01:19:45.913 --> 01:19:48.643
We did like he asked
and we left him.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:52.277
He went to jail for a dog.

01:19:53.754 --> 01:19:56.552
You want to hear the funny part?

01:19:56.624 --> 01:19:59.218
Paden didn't even like that damn dog.

01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:03.295
It evened out in the end.

01:20:03.364 --> 01:20:05.298
They locked me up.

01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:07.493
The dog sprung me.

01:20:08.302 --> 01:20:10.236
Where's the dog now?

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:13.573
He left me.

01:20:15.142 --> 01:20:18.043
Come on, Paden.
I'll buy you a drink.

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:32.156
I took out $13.

01:20:35.996 --> 01:20:37.930
This is a lot of money.

01:20:37.998 --> 01:20:40.660
I told you this was a sweet setup.

01:20:40.734 --> 01:20:42.793
It is that.

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.198
Maybe you could run it without Stella.

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:51.075
This is her life.

01:20:51.145 --> 01:20:53.613
I'll go before she does.

01:20:53.681 --> 01:20:56.241
Easy, boy.
It's just an idea.

01:20:56.317 --> 01:20:58.285
Thanks but forget it.

01:21:01.522 --> 01:21:05.549
Paden, what makes all this work...

01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:07.594
is me doing my job.

01:21:08.729 --> 01:21:12.324
Those fellows you come to town with
are causing some trouble.

01:21:12.399 --> 01:21:14.765
It's gonna take
some straightening out.

01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:17.829
I have my responsibilities.

01:21:17.905 --> 01:21:21.363
I want you to understand
it has nothing to do with us.

01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:24.506
What is it you want from me?

01:21:24.578 --> 01:21:26.011
Nothin'.

01:21:26.814 --> 01:21:28.247
Do nothin'.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:30.842
Don't get between us.

01:21:33.954 --> 01:21:36.855
I'm a great believer in doing nothin'.

01:21:38.158 --> 01:21:40.524
We understand each other.

01:21:42.429 --> 01:21:44.761
Don't worry about me.

01:21:44.832 --> 01:21:49.292
If you're taking on Emmett, the last
place I want to be is between you.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.853
You're empty.

01:23:31.972 --> 01:23:33.906
Ain't you dead yet?

01:23:33.974 --> 01:23:36.465
Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.

01:23:36.543 --> 01:23:39.671
I guess you couldn't hear us comin'.

01:23:40.814 --> 01:23:43.180
He was practicing so hard
for a fight...

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:46.242
he missed the whole thing.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.947
So long, stranger.

01:23:52.893 --> 01:23:55.953
I don't wanna kill you
and you don't wanna be dead.

01:23:57.398 --> 01:23:59.332
He can't be that good.

01:24:00.534 --> 01:24:02.126
You wanna find out?

01:24:04.905 --> 01:24:07.100
I think we should do like he says.

01:24:27.928 --> 01:24:29.896
How you feeling?

01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:33.595
I'd be a lot worse
if you hadn't come along.

01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:36.636
I didn't just come along.
I was lookin' for you.

01:24:36.703 --> 01:24:39.831
Jake said you were out there.

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:44.071
He told me about that business
the other day.

01:24:44.144 --> 01:24:48.137
He said you boys took
a Henry rifle...

01:24:48.215 --> 01:24:50.342
off one of McKendrick's men.

01:24:51.318 --> 01:24:54.515
- I wanted to see it.
- That's it.

01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:06.560
This was my father's.
The man who killed him took it.

01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:09.735
I'm sorry.

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.301
I gotta get to my brother. They come
after me, they'll want him, too.

01:25:17.377 --> 01:25:19.470
- You'll never make it.
- I've got to.

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:24.850
I'II go.

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:32.550
I'll bring Jake here.

01:25:40.767 --> 01:25:43.497
You be careful.

01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:45.868
You're in it now.

01:25:45.939 --> 01:25:48.464
It's gonna get mean.

01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:06.619
Augie, I've had enough of this.

01:26:06.693 --> 01:26:09.253
Kiss your father
and get in bed.

01:26:22.943 --> 01:26:24.934
Get out.
We have nothing to talk about.

01:26:25.012 --> 01:26:28.038
- I need help.
- Why come to me?

01:26:28.115 --> 01:26:31.573
Because you're my sister.
There's nobody else.

01:26:37.157 --> 01:26:40.786
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake.
I've gotta talk to him.

01:26:40.861 --> 01:26:44.319
- What's stoppin' you?
- They're watching. I can't get through.

01:26:45.365 --> 01:26:47.299
What makes you think I could?

01:26:47.367 --> 01:26:49.494
Why would they stop you?

01:26:52.272 --> 01:26:54.604
'Cause I'm your sister.

01:26:55.676 --> 01:26:58.110
He ain't in the saloon, either.

01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:04.373
Where is that boy?

01:27:06.787 --> 01:27:08.220
You're crazy!

01:27:23.437 --> 01:27:26.600
- Why him?
- You need help, don't you?

01:27:34.948 --> 01:27:36.973
Jake said he'd meet you
behind the church.

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:39.348
Be careful.
They're all over the place.

01:27:40.487 --> 01:27:41.920
Thanks.

01:27:43.123 --> 01:27:44.556
Good luck.

01:28:02.409 --> 01:28:04.934
You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.

01:28:05.879 --> 01:28:08.313
Now don't shoot the sheriff.

01:28:09.483 --> 01:28:11.417
That's against the law.

01:28:15.522 --> 01:28:18.082
So is killing a deputy.

01:28:24.464 --> 01:28:27.126
We're gonna give you a fair trial...

01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:31.704
followed by a first-class hangin'.

01:28:33.006 --> 01:28:36.066
Or you could ride out of here
before dawn.

01:28:37.544 --> 01:28:41.071
You just have to tell me where
I can find your friend Emmett.

01:28:57.664 --> 01:28:59.598
Why are they doing this?

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.561
Because they enjoy it.

01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:07.565
- What happened to Emmett?
- Cobb's men almost killed him.

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:09.802
That's what happened.

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:12.106
I got there just short of too late.

01:29:14.147 --> 01:29:15.580
Lucky.

01:29:17.184 --> 01:29:18.617
Yeah.

01:29:19.786 --> 01:29:22.016
It's working out real good.

01:29:23.523 --> 01:29:25.457
Where's Emmett now?

01:29:26.393 --> 01:29:29.191
You're working for Cobb these days,
aren't you?

01:29:32.499 --> 01:29:36.060
Your friends have been beating me
to find that out.

01:29:36.136 --> 01:29:38.627
You think I'm just gonna tell you?

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.168
You waltzed in here easy.

01:29:43.243 --> 01:29:45.609
You can go out the same way.

01:29:47.114 --> 01:29:49.981
Me they figure to carry out.

01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:14.832
Is he all right?

01:30:14.908 --> 01:30:17.570
Looks bad, Rae.

01:30:17.644 --> 01:30:19.771
He's a hard man.

01:30:19.846 --> 01:30:22.178
He won't give them what they want.

01:30:22.249 --> 01:30:24.444
It's gonna cost him.

01:30:24.518 --> 01:30:26.247
Can't you stop 'em?

01:30:28.288 --> 01:30:30.256
I don't think so.

01:30:36.496 --> 01:30:38.487
What is it?

01:30:53.313 --> 01:30:56.680
Oh, Kate.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.183
Sweet Kate.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.705
Don't.

01:31:24.010 --> 01:31:27.878
Jake's been with me all evening.
I just left him.

01:31:27.948 --> 01:31:30.416
- Where is he now?
- Went home.

01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:38.749
Been with you all evening?
Even after Slick came to get him?

01:31:38.825 --> 01:31:40.793
Slick didn't come.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.987
Stop it!

01:32:49.062 --> 01:32:50.996
He saw us.

01:32:51.064 --> 01:32:52.497
Bring him.

01:33:32.305 --> 01:33:33.738
Fire!

01:33:33.807 --> 01:33:36.537
The land office is on fire!

01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:52.424
Help J.T.

01:33:52.492 --> 01:33:54.892
Where's Augie?
Her boy must be upstairs.

01:33:54.961 --> 01:33:58.920
No. No.
They took him.

01:33:58.999 --> 01:34:01.524
They took my Augie.

01:34:11.544 --> 01:34:14.479
You go around the back of the house.

01:34:14.547 --> 01:34:17.414
Wyoming, you go over there
and help out.

01:34:21.554 --> 01:34:24.421
Tom, you help with the buckets, too.

01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:26.755
Nathan, help with that wagon.

01:35:08.401 --> 01:35:10.335
Give it up.

01:35:14.474 --> 01:35:18.137
I hate to see this kind of thing
in my town.

01:35:18.211 --> 01:35:20.736
Gonna have to look into this.

01:35:20.814 --> 01:35:22.475
Maybe I will, too.

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.980
I thought we talked about that.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.888
We didn't talk about this.

01:35:31.257 --> 01:35:33.691
They took the little boy, Cobb.

01:35:56.216 --> 01:35:59.014
You're still worried about the dog,
aren't you?

01:36:00.987 --> 01:36:04.013
You've gotta calm down. Everything
will be put straight in a few days.

01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:09.425
Yeah. I saw how you put
Mal Johnson straight.

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:18.829
Never could count on you
to be reasonable.

01:36:20.173 --> 01:36:23.108
Don't force me to make an adjustment
around here.

01:36:26.012 --> 01:36:29.846
Cobb, you got nothing I need.

01:36:32.585 --> 01:36:34.883
I'm not thinking
about your future, Paden.

01:36:36.322 --> 01:36:38.290
I'm worried about Stella.

01:36:44.264 --> 01:36:46.630
What's she got to do with this?

01:36:48.067 --> 01:36:50.001
Not a thing.

01:36:51.271 --> 01:36:53.398
She's just a mutual friend.

01:36:55.575 --> 01:36:59.375
But if you wind up
on the wrong side of this...

01:36:59.445 --> 01:37:01.379
she's gonna get hurt.

01:37:05.985 --> 01:37:08.453
I'm trying to save you from yourself.

01:37:09.422 --> 01:37:11.413
Don't change your luck.

01:37:44.657 --> 01:37:48.149
- What is it that I can't figure?
- What do you mean?

01:37:49.362 --> 01:37:54.356
Cobb's got something on you
and it must be pretty good.

01:37:54.434 --> 01:37:56.459
What makes you say that?

01:37:56.536 --> 01:37:59.835
If he didn't, you'd never sit still
with all this going on.

01:37:59.906 --> 01:38:02.101
You sure?

01:38:02.175 --> 01:38:04.302
Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.

01:38:07.013 --> 01:38:08.605
What's he got?

01:38:17.357 --> 01:38:21.123
Cobb says there's no tellin'
what you're gonna care about.

01:38:22.829 --> 01:38:24.797
Is that what he said?

01:38:27.166 --> 01:38:29.964
He figured it okay this time.

01:38:58.965 --> 01:39:02.992
Look who's here, Johnson.
Your sweet little sister.

01:39:03.069 --> 01:39:07.768
Maybe I better search her.
It won't be easy.

01:39:08.675 --> 01:39:11.303
I've only got one good hand.

01:39:48.114 --> 01:39:50.912
Garth, you in there?

01:40:12.438 --> 01:40:14.668
To my Midnight Star.

01:40:16.042 --> 01:40:18.943
Cobb's using me to stop you.

01:40:20.446 --> 01:40:24.849
Good people are being hurt
because of me.

01:40:24.917 --> 01:40:27.044
That makes me mad.

01:40:29.722 --> 01:40:33.658
Some people think
because they're stronger or meaner...

01:40:33.726 --> 01:40:36.092
they can push you around.

01:40:36.162 --> 01:40:38.460
I've seen a lot of that.

01:40:39.365 --> 01:40:43.267
But it's only true
if you let it be.

01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:46.066
The world's what you make of it.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.370
I like your attitude,
but it can be risky.

01:40:52.979 --> 01:40:56.005
I'm ready for that.

01:40:56.082 --> 01:40:58.016
What about you?

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.479
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:41:05.691 --> 01:41:10.060
He can't hurt me
if he's dead.

01:41:21.174 --> 01:41:23.267
Stella, come quick.

01:41:30.583 --> 01:41:34.212
She sprung her brother all by herself
and this is what happened.

01:41:34.287 --> 01:41:37.688
- He brought her here.
- Where'd he go?

01:41:37.757 --> 01:41:42.456
I told him about Jake and the
little boy. He went off after Emmett.

01:41:42.528 --> 01:41:46.328
Stop crying. Get Doc Skinner
and bring him to the shed.

01:41:49.902 --> 01:41:52.803
Pick her up.
I've got a place to hide her.

01:41:55.341 --> 01:41:58.902
You better get in there with her
until this thing is over.

01:42:24.036 --> 01:42:25.970
Where's Jake?

01:42:26.038 --> 01:42:29.405
- McKendrick's men got him.
- Is he alive?

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:35.114
It's worse than that.

01:42:35.181 --> 01:42:37.411
They took him at your sister's house.

01:42:37.483 --> 01:42:39.974
Her husband was shot. I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

01:42:41.053 --> 01:42:43.283
- Kate?
- She was hurt.

01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:46.424
Pretty bad.

01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:52.960
They took the little boy with them.

01:43:46.886 --> 01:43:48.649
Put on one of these.

01:43:50.323 --> 01:43:52.257
This ought to do.

01:44:30.663 --> 01:44:32.460
Garth?

01:44:32.531 --> 01:44:33.964
Fox!

01:44:40.306 --> 01:44:44.834
Get Kyle and Dusty over here.
And keep your eyes open.

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:47.435
We're running out of deputies.

01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:06.081
Stampede!

01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:10.141
Turn 'em around!

01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:04.034
Go!

01:49:46.445 --> 01:49:48.470
Augie, where's Jake?

01:49:48.547 --> 01:49:50.014
He's dead.

01:49:50.082 --> 01:49:51.515
What?

01:49:52.418 --> 01:49:55.410
He was trying to get away...

01:49:55.487 --> 01:49:58.752
and he fell off his horse,
off a cliff.

01:50:00.259 --> 01:50:02.955
Jake fell off his horse?

01:50:06.298 --> 01:50:08.289
It's all right.

01:51:22.174 --> 01:51:24.836
Yeah! Where's Emmett?

01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:26.343
Inside.

01:51:28.747 --> 01:51:31.773
- Where have you been?
- Playing dead.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.511
- Let's get out of here.
- Right.

01:52:27.439 --> 01:52:29.771
- Jake!
- Uncle Jake!

01:52:31.376 --> 01:52:32.809
Hi, guys.

01:52:37.382 --> 01:52:39.316
Come on, Augie.

01:52:41.286 --> 01:52:43.880
Come on, Augie, jump.

01:52:43.956 --> 01:52:45.389
Come on!

01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:52.527
He's on the roof, Paden.

01:53:45.584 --> 01:53:48.212
It never should've got this far, Cobb.

01:53:48.287 --> 01:53:50.380
This is as far as it's goin'.

01:53:50.455 --> 01:53:52.685
I'll do my part...

01:53:52.758 --> 01:53:55.192
but you better watch your ass.

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:57.626
These guys will shoot it off.

01:54:11.577 --> 01:54:13.943
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:54:16.448 --> 01:54:18.916
It used to be a peaceful town.

01:54:22.654 --> 01:54:25.088
What's goin' on, Sheriff?

01:54:26.692 --> 01:54:29.092
Hide and watch.

01:54:38.403 --> 01:54:41.804
Everybody off the streets.
There's gonna be trouble.

01:54:58.090 --> 01:55:01.526
- Any sign of Stella?
- Been looking.

01:55:01.593 --> 01:55:05.120
- See if you can find Rae.
- Yeah.

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:39.018
You wait till we get back.
Don't come in.

01:55:48.273 --> 01:55:50.207
See you around.

01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:53.676
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.613
You're on.

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.781
Let's get 'em!

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:04.479
Hey, Paden.

01:56:06.258 --> 01:56:07.691
Good luck.

01:56:33.585 --> 01:56:36.247
I'm going for the doctor.

01:56:36.321 --> 01:56:38.789
You're going to be all right.

01:57:30.742 --> 01:57:33.176
Don't be afraid, baby.

01:57:33.245 --> 01:57:37.341
I'll stay with you
until your little friend comes back.

01:57:44.923 --> 01:57:48.222
Come on out, boys!
Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!

02:00:11.703 --> 02:00:13.136
Mal.

02:00:15.207 --> 02:00:18.608
I'm glad you're here. I've been watching
her, but she needs a doctor.

02:00:23.248 --> 02:00:24.681
Yeah.

02:00:53.211 --> 02:00:55.372
Looking for this?

02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.185
It's all right.
I'm here now.

02:05:26.117 --> 02:05:28.108
What a waste.

02:05:29.821 --> 02:05:32.688
This could've been such a sweet deal
for us.

02:05:34.425 --> 02:05:36.723
Yeah.

02:05:36.794 --> 02:05:38.352
Bad luck.

02:05:46.971 --> 02:05:48.529
Good-bye, Cobb.

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.442
Good-bye, Paden.

02:06:47.165 --> 02:06:48.598
To California.

02:06:57.875 --> 02:07:00.435
- Got to go.
- Right.

02:07:10.855 --> 02:07:13.289
You take care of yourself,
you hear?

02:07:14.158 --> 02:07:15.625
You, too.

02:07:20.932 --> 02:07:23.093
Jake, Paden.

02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:28.305
Come on, Molly.

02:07:47.325 --> 02:07:50.158
Weren't you gonna come out
and say good-bye?

02:07:50.228 --> 02:07:52.890
I already did that.

02:07:52.964 --> 02:07:55.194
You know where I'll be.

02:07:56.134 --> 02:07:57.567
Yeah.

02:08:16.554 --> 02:08:17.987
So long, Paden.

02:08:18.056 --> 02:08:20.752
So long, Jake.

02:08:26.464 --> 02:08:28.864
You might make a farmer yet.

02:08:29.534 --> 02:08:32.503
I got a job.

02:08:42.346 --> 02:08:44.371
Let's get goin'.

02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.758
Take care of your folks.

02:08:57.829 --> 02:08:59.262
I will.

02:09:07.071 --> 02:09:09.039
We'll be back!
