Ma, what are you doing?

00:45.967 --> 00:48.300
There's a hurricane a-comin'!

00:48.967 --> 00:50.700
Girls, guess what?

00:50.767 --> 00:53.567
You know that
"Save the McKinley Lighthouse" campaign

00:53.633 --> 00:54.767
I've been talking about?

00:55.367 --> 00:56.467
Mmm... no.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.300
I just got the television station

00:59.367 --> 01:03.133
to give me eight hours of air time
for the telethon.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.200
Sign me up. I'd love to help.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.066
Gloria is coming here?

01:07.133 --> 01:09.500
I wish I knew why
you two didn't get along.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.333
I just don't understand.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.100
For some reason, you've always
been jealous of my good daughter.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.633
She has no money?

01:17.700 --> 01:18.567
Not a dime.

01:18.633 --> 01:19.900
Yes!

01:20.900 --> 01:24.834
Dr. Halperin is really working wonders
with Stan.

01:24.900 --> 01:30.166
You know, he's gotten him to transfer
his love for me to a fake monkey.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.367
Hi. It's me, Stan.

01:33.433 --> 01:36.066
For once, everything is going well.

01:36.133 --> 01:37.433
My sister's in my life.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.467
Stan's out of my life.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.800
I won't see him for two whole years.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.667
Everything is perfect.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.100
Aah!

01:50.367 --> 01:53.367
(mellow music playing)

02:20.934 --> 02:23.533
Dorothy, Dorothy, are you okay?

02:23.600 --> 02:25.967
Oh, what a dream.

02:26.367 --> 02:30.900
Ahh, I dreamt that you and Stan
were in bed together.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.367
Isn't that silly?

02:32.433 --> 02:37.934
Oh, I mean, my loving sister
and the man I despise most.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.734
Oh, God. The nightmare continues.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.767
How could you do this to me?

02:52.834 --> 02:55.433
There's a hurricane a-coming.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.734
Fierce winds, driving rains.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.767
Who knows what's gonna happen
to all of us?

03:01.834 --> 03:04.433
I felt scared and vulnerable.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.600
You big bald girl.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.500
Look, I know it's wrong, but I was
confused, so I called Dr. Halperin.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.734
He's coming over right away.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.767
This is all my fault.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.400
It's mine.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.767
Maybe it's my fault.

03:17.834 --> 03:21.200
Who goes to their room in the middle
of the day without knocking?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.667
Oh, pussycat, you've come to.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.667
It wasn't easy getting you in here.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.767
Stan took your head.
Gloria took your legs.

03:32.834 --> 03:36.400
I haven't heard such heavy breathing
since before you passed out.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.533
Ma, please.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.700
When I said that to Stan,
he laughed so hard he dropped you.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.166
But you sound happy about this.

03:48.233 --> 03:50.800
I am. This is wonderful.
Your sister found a man.

03:51.700 --> 03:55.400
All the years I was with him,
he was a yutz.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.934
She goes to bed with him, and it's great?

03:58.033 --> 04:00.433
He's wrong for you, perfect for her.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.533
Ma, that's ridiculous.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.033
Gloria's the kind of woman
who's no good alone.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.867
She needs a rich man to buy her things,

04:07.934 --> 04:09.633
and make her feel special.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.367
What kind of woman am I?

04:11.433 --> 04:12.900
The kind who should live with her mother.

04:12.967 --> 04:13.834
(doorbell rings)

04:17.033 --> 04:17.700
(sighs)

04:18.400 --> 04:20.834
-Come in, doctor.
-Hello, Dorothy.

04:20.900 --> 04:23.133
-Hello, Dorothy.
-This isn't a good time.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.233
When is it?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.500
I'm with him.
We were on a date when you beeped him.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.100
You two are dating?

04:30.166 --> 04:31.266
You know, for years,

04:31.333 --> 04:33.767
my father's been telling me
to see a psychiatrist.

04:36.133 --> 04:37.734
I couldn't understand why.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.300
A couple of weeks ago, it dawned on me.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.066
He probably meant socially.

04:42.467 --> 04:43.600
Oh, it's wonderful.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.100
They really listen.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.900
She really talks.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.500
Nice robe.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.900
I'll put you down
for an extra session this week.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.533
Carol, it's nice to see you,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.567
but this is really
a rather personal matter.

04:58.633 --> 05:02.266
Don't worry.
Richie tells me about all his cases.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.200
That isn't true, is it...

05:04.266 --> 05:05.100
Richie?

05:06.233 --> 05:08.934
I tell her things in very general terms.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.500
I make up crazy names for my patients.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.633
She wouldn't know who I was talking about.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.266
-Yeah, but nevertheless--
-Oh, my God.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.333
I'm in the way.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.734
I'll go in the kitchen.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.567
I used to worry I would miss something,
but that was before Richie.

05:22.633 --> 05:25.000
He's making me so unneurotic.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.934
Don't talk about me. It'll kill me.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.233
So, kids, what's going on?

05:32.300 --> 05:35.567
Well, doc, I, uh, have some news.

05:35.633 --> 05:39.266
I sort of slept with Dorothy's sister.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.500
You're off the monkey.<i> Mazel tov.</i>

05:47.133 --> 05:48.734
Oh, my God.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.467
What?

05:49.533 --> 05:52.000
You're Dan and Morothy.

05:54.633 --> 05:56.767
Wild and crazy names?

05:56.834 --> 05:59.233
Carol, this is a different
Dan and Morothy.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.700
These aren't the two nuts
who couldn't stop seeing each other?

06:02.767 --> 06:06.500
Dan, a sex-crazed nudnik
with occasional performance problems,

06:06.567 --> 06:11.033
and Morothy, a domineering tyrant
who totally emasculated him?

06:17.166 --> 06:18.934
No more calls. We have a winner.

06:25.567 --> 06:29.000
An hour ago, my life was perfect.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.233
I was finally rid of Dan.

06:31.633 --> 06:35.000
I felt good about my sister being back,
and now this.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.867
How am I supposed to cope with this?

06:36.934 --> 06:40.000
Believe me. It won't happen again.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.333
It was a mistake.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

06:43.100 --> 06:47.266
Better a slip-up in the first two years
of the separation than later.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.400
Stan, try again.

06:48.467 --> 06:52.967
Dorothy, I'm here for you at half price

06:53.033 --> 06:54.834
because of the Dan and Morothy thing.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.367
Carol, come on.

06:58.433 --> 06:59.333
(clears throat)

07:00.433 --> 07:02.633
What would make Stan do such a thing?

07:02.700 --> 07:06.300
Strict Freudians would call it
a codependence transference,

07:06.367 --> 07:07.433
but if you ask me...

07:07.967 --> 07:09.066
Men are pigs.

07:14.734 --> 07:19.333
(news man) <i>Hurricane Gil's effects</i>
<i>are being felt along the Florida coast.</i>

07:20.700 --> 07:22.567
Oh. Have the acts shown?

07:22.633 --> 07:24.400
Are we all set?

07:24.467 --> 07:26.900
All set? Trees are falling.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.700
Power lines are down.

07:28.767 --> 07:29.900
You go on in two minutes.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.467
Only one act has shown up.

07:31.533 --> 07:34.033
You got eight hours. What will you do?

07:34.100 --> 07:38.033
It doesn't matter how many acts show up

07:38.100 --> 07:40.900
or how many hours of air time
we have to fill.

07:40.967 --> 07:43.066
There is only one thing that matters.

07:43.133 --> 07:46.867
The indomitable devotion
we have in our hearts for that windmill.

07:49.433 --> 07:53.100
It's a devotion. It's a love.

07:53.166 --> 07:56.633
As God is our witness,
we are going to save that windmill.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.033
It's a lighthouse, Blanche.

08:01.734 --> 08:04.000
We're saving the McKinley lighthouse.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.133
That eyesore?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.533
That's the one.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.200
We're going to make this a great telethon.

08:09.266 --> 08:11.934
We'll do the entertaining ourselves
if we have to.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.767
Oh...

08:12.834 --> 08:14.934
Ladies, you're on in 10 seconds.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.033
Uh, in 10... Oh, I've got to...

08:20.100 --> 08:22.200
5, 4, 3...

08:22.266 --> 08:23.200
2...

08:26.066 --> 08:28.834
-No. No.
-You should start.

08:28.900 --> 08:33.700
Hello, this is Rose Nylund,
and this is Blanche Devereaux.

08:33.767 --> 08:34.734
Hi, boys.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.667
And we're going to be with you
for the next eight hours

08:40.734 --> 08:43.533
on the
<i>Save the McKinley Lighthouse</i> telethon.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.433
Please call the number
that's flashing on your screen

08:46.500 --> 08:47.567
to make your pledges.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.700
For that handsome guy in the red corvette

08:50.767 --> 08:53.233
that I cut off on highway 12 yesterday,

08:53.300 --> 08:57.266
call my personal number,
which is flashing on your screen now.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.467
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

09:08.033 --> 09:11.400
While Blanche is doing that,
why don't I head over to the piano?

09:13.133 --> 09:16.767
I'd like to sing you a song
that I used to sing as a child.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.233
It's an old Minnesotan farm song

09:19.300 --> 09:22.600
entitled
"I Never Thought I'd Grow A Hair There".

09:24.600 --> 09:29.700
(piano plays)

09:29.767 --> 09:32.367
<i>♪ Oom-pah-pah oom-pah-pah ♪</i>

09:32.433 --> 09:34.166
<i>♪ Oom-pah-pah oom ♪</i>

09:34.233 --> 09:38.900
<i>-♪ What the hell is that hair... ♪</i>
-We just got a pledge for $20.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.533
Let's go to the tote board.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.633
Drumroll.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.133
(drumroll)

09:46.667 --> 09:49.166
(telephone rings)

09:52.200 --> 09:54.600
We're off to a good start.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.100
Now, where was I?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.767
Oh, yes, when Hans first spots the hair.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.734
<i>♪ Oom-pah-pah oom-pah-pah ♪</i>

10:02.800 --> 10:06.300
<i>-♪ Oom-pah-pah... ♪</i>
-Rose, I just got a pledge for $50

10:06.367 --> 10:07.834
if you will stop singing.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.734
Right.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.433
50 bucks if she stops singing.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.633
I'll throw in another 50
if you slam the piano lid on her fingers.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.567
Ma, after we get the patio door
boarded up,

10:23.633 --> 10:25.367
we really should head for the shelter.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.900
Oh, Dorothy.

10:27.367 --> 10:28.500
What's the matter, kitten?

10:28.567 --> 10:30.700
I'm so mad at myself.

10:30.767 --> 10:33.533
You and I were finally beginning
to get close,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.867
and I had to go and do something stupid.

10:36.934 --> 10:40.734
I just feel so terrible,
and the odd thing is

10:40.800 --> 10:45.834
I wouldn't have thought to give Stan
a second look if Ma hadn't insisted.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.633
What are you talking about?

10:51.700 --> 10:54.500
Well, Ma practically pushed us together.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.200
M-ma, may I see you in the kitchen?

10:58.233 --> 11:00.734
You look mighty pretty today, pussycat.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.533
This isn't going to work,
you little stick person.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.867
What did I do?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.633
You fixed my ex-husband up with my sister.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.533
You see nothing wrong?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.767
That's normal.
In some primitive societies,

11:14.834 --> 11:18.000
it's considered good manners
to give your ex-husband to your sister?

11:18.066 --> 11:20.000
In some primitive societies,

11:20.066 --> 11:24.934
they leave their elderly out in a field
for large birds to feed on.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.900
Where do we draw the line?

11:29.967 --> 11:31.900
Right before the large bird thing.

11:33.767 --> 11:36.333
Dorothy, she was just trying to help,

11:36.400 --> 11:39.967
and I never actually thought
Stan sent me those flowers.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.667
You sent her flowers?

11:41.734 --> 11:43.800
I had to get the ball rolling somehow.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.100
You have really done it this time.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.033
I don't blame you, Gloria.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.433
This is your fault.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.266
You never consider my feelings.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.333
You can't act like this anymore.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.600
I can't take it.

11:55.667 --> 11:56.767
I won't take it.

11:56.834 --> 11:57.667
Dorothy...

11:58.233 --> 11:59.633
Dorothy, wait.

12:01.233 --> 12:04.667
Fine. You don't want to take it anymore,
you don't have to take it.

12:05.533 --> 12:07.233
See how well you do without me.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.400
(mellow music playing)

12:16.100 --> 12:18.333
(chirping)

12:23.567 --> 12:26.633
And now, I'd like to do a happy cricket.

12:26.934 --> 12:28.300
Note the difference.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.600
(chirping)

12:33.200 --> 12:34.567
That's great.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.166
Do you do any other insects?

12:36.233 --> 12:38.100
Well, I do a grasshopper that...

12:38.600 --> 12:39.900
Nah. I can't do it on TV.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.633
Oh, well, thank you.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.333
Thank you, Davy Cricket.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.834
And now, let's see how Blanche is doing
on the phones.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.633
-Blanche?
-Huh?

12:51.700 --> 12:54.367
Nothing here, Rose. Back to you.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.667
Oh, wait. I have a bulletin.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.767
"The intensity of hurricane Gil
has increased dramatically.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.467
Several boats at the marina
have been beached or capsized."

13:06.533 --> 13:08.834
Oh, and here's an item
of particular interest.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.367
"The McKinley lighthouse
has been completely destroyed."

13:14.834 --> 13:15.867
What did you say?

13:15.934 --> 13:20.133
I repeat, "The McKinley lighthouse
has been completely destroyed"?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.500
Oh, that's not good for us.

13:22.567 --> 13:23.300
No!

13:24.233 --> 13:25.867
What about our telethon?

13:25.934 --> 13:27.467
The telethon is over.

13:27.533 --> 13:31.800
They're turning the air waves over
to the national weather service.

13:31.867 --> 13:35.133
This studio has been designated
an official hurricane shelter.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.800
Fine, but before I go,
I would like to make one final plea.

13:39.867 --> 13:44.400
I know there's goodness in your heart,
and I know you want to give.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.100
Well, I am ready to take
anything you have to offer.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.633
Share with me.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.266
We've been off the air for two minutes.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.200
I know.
I'm talking to Chester on camera two.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.633
Share with me, Chester.

14:05.433 --> 14:06.233
(Dorothy) Ma?

14:06.767 --> 14:08.233
Ma, are you home?

14:08.300 --> 14:09.700
Ma, don't hide.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.000
Ma?

14:15.133 --> 14:18.133
No, you're too smart to hide
in the same place twice.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.834
-Ma?
-(knock on door)

14:27.100 --> 14:28.900
Hello, Ma'am, are you the resident here?

14:28.967 --> 14:30.900
My God. It's my mother.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.934
No, Ma'am. I'm a police officer.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.400
I'm aware of that.

14:36.467 --> 14:39.400
Listen, Ma'am,
we're evacuating everyone on this street.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.934
I'd love to come with you,
but I can't find my mother.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.900
Sorry. Everybody has to come with us.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.467
We'll find her.

14:46.533 --> 14:49.133
Give me two minutes.
I have to check the bedrooms.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.500
Can I show the kid Blanche's room
while we're waiting?

14:55.066 --> 14:55.967
Nah.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.133
Let him be surprised.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.000
Oh, my God!

15:01.834 --> 15:02.734
Dorothy.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.600
Gloria, Stan.

15:05.133 --> 15:07.233
Hey, Deja Vu, huh, babe?

15:07.300 --> 15:08.300
(laughs)
Ahem.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.266
Just tell me why.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.900
Why in this house?

15:11.967 --> 15:13.900
Why in my bed again?

15:13.967 --> 15:16.367
This place has memories for us.

15:16.433 --> 15:18.567
It's where Gloria and I first...

15:18.934 --> 15:20.700
I don't have to tell you. You were there.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.166
Dorothy, it just happened.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.734
I know you think it's wrong,
but it's not a crime.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.467
Yes, it is.

15:28.533 --> 15:29.867
Officers!

15:33.266 --> 15:34.133
You brought the cops?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.633
That's right. I came prepared.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.000
Officers, shoot these people.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.500
(wind howling)

15:46.567 --> 15:49.033
You heard me. I'm a taxpayer. Shoot them.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.900
No can do, Ma'am.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.367
You have to do something.
This is ridiculous.

15:54.433 --> 15:59.266
My mother is missing because they can't
keep their hands off each other.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.967
Dorothy, you're being irrational.

16:01.033 --> 16:02.133
Yes, I am a pig.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.333
Oh, yeah? What precinct?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.333
We're evacuating the entire neighborhood.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.700
You'll have to put away the fighting
until we get down to the shelter.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.133
We will wait in the car.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.333
You can, too, shoot them.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.767
I cannot shoot them.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.500
I can only shoot looters.

16:21.567 --> 16:22.633
Oh, I understand.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.066
Stan, pick up the tv on your way out.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.133
(knock on door)

16:37.600 --> 16:40.300
I was getting ready to go to the shelter.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.467
Why are you here?

16:41.533 --> 16:43.066
You're my big brother.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.500
I can only come to you.

16:44.567 --> 16:45.834
I'm in trouble.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.367
Then the boy will marry you.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.700
No, no. It's nothing like that.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.066
I'm having problems
with Dorothy and Gloria.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.734
I'm a terrible mother.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.667
You're a wonderful mother.

17:02.734 --> 17:05.066
No. I really upset my Dorothy.

17:05.533 --> 17:09.066
She's at a very difficult age,
just out of menopause,

17:09.133 --> 17:11.266
but the sex drive isn't totally dead yet.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.834
That is an awkward time.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.467
Gloria, she's my baby.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.734
She hasn't even lost her adult teeth yet.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.834
I'd kill for corn that wasn't creamed.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.200
I was stupid.

17:28.266 --> 17:30.066
I arranged for Stan and Gloria
to get together.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.633
I should have known better.

17:32.700 --> 17:33.867
It's like when they were young.

17:33.934 --> 17:35.967
Whenever Gloria
took one of Dorothy's old toys,

17:36.033 --> 17:38.934
Dorothy would get interested again
and want it back.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.300
I can still hear her yelling,
"Gloria took my stick."

17:44.367 --> 17:46.433
Boy, we come from a poor family.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.834
The way I see it is
you gave Stan to Gloria,

17:53.467 --> 17:57.900
but Stan's not a stick, a Betsy-Wetsy,
or a rubber ball.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.100
He's a man.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.233
You are so wise.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.500
I listen to a lot of talk radio.

18:07.033 --> 18:10.934
I think your love for one child
blinded your love for the other,

18:11.433 --> 18:16.600
but I think you did Dorothy wrong,
and I think you must make it right.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.367
(loud crash)

18:18.433 --> 18:19.800
We better get to the shelter.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.133
What is this?

18:22.233 --> 18:23.600
The entrance is blocked.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.100
We can't get out! We'll die.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.033
I have a plan.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.900
They taught me how to deal
with emergencies in the Italian army.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.500
Help!

18:32.567 --> 18:33.700
Help!

18:33.767 --> 18:35.200
-Please, help!
-Help!

18:40.867 --> 18:41.533
(groans)

18:41.600 --> 18:44.233
Blanche, what are you doing
with all that candy?

18:44.300 --> 18:45.934
Whenever there is a natural disaster,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.200
some unscrupulous opportunist
always hoards the food.

18:49.266 --> 18:51.133
It might as well be me.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.800
(groans)

18:54.867 --> 18:56.734
Look, I've given those cops long enough.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.100
I just have to go out there
and try to find Ma.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.633
You can't go out there.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.233
I can't just sit here.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.233
But it is too dangerous.

19:04.633 --> 19:07.166
Oh, I remember back in St. Olaf.

19:07.467 --> 19:11.900
During a tornado, my mother left
the storm cellar to find Toto.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.233
Her constant companion and favorite cow.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.133
Why are we nice to her?

19:24.066 --> 19:29.367
When mother went out in the storm,
she got quite a bump on her head.

19:29.433 --> 19:30.767
For the rest of her days,

19:30.834 --> 19:34.000
she tried to get that cow in the basket
on the front of her bicycle.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.667
(rain poring)

19:43.200 --> 19:44.767
The machines are all empty.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.266
That's terrible.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.266
-Would you like a Clark bar?
-Sure.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
2.50.

19:50.266 --> 19:51.300
(chuckle)

19:53.433 --> 19:57.233
It's nice to be able to talk again
like human beings, like friends.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.767
I said 2.50, Stan.

19:58.834 --> 19:59.600
Sorry.

19:59.667 --> 20:00.533
(clears throat)

20:03.400 --> 20:05.533
Dorothy, what's happening to us?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.834
I don't know.
I was thinking about it myself.

20:08.300 --> 20:13.633
I don't approve of you and Gloria,
but if you honestly love her--

20:13.700 --> 20:16.233
No, I don't think I love her,

20:16.300 --> 20:19.433
I'm realizing maybe I was with her
just to make you jealous,

20:19.500 --> 20:21.033
just like the monkey.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.800
You know something, Stan?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.867
I was a little jealous.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.600
Of an old traffic cone with a monkey head?

20:28.667 --> 20:31.333
Jealous of my sister, you idiot.

20:31.400 --> 20:36.166
You know, this is what I miss,
you calling me idiot,

20:36.900 --> 20:39.467
slamming the door in my face
when I come over.

20:39.533 --> 20:40.734
I know what you mean.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.233
We weren't happy when we were married.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.734
We weren't happy
when we were going to remarry.

20:47.133 --> 20:51.200
Seems our relationship works best
when we're just plain divorced.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.667
I don't want to spend two years
without speaking to you.

20:54.734 --> 20:56.266
No. We shouldn't, Stan.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.000
We share children.

20:58.066 --> 21:02.967
We share grandchildren,
and I like slamming the door in your face.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.400
This is great.

21:05.467 --> 21:08.734
We'll celebrate,
pop open a soda and make a toast.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.734
Nice try. 5 bucks.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.233
Mrs. Zbornak, we found your mother.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.433
Ma, are you okay?

21:16.500 --> 21:18.133
Of course, I'm okay

21:18.467 --> 21:19.400
Oh, Ma.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.033
Thank God.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.033
Give me a hug.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.633
Okay.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.967
Now you two hug.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.333
Go on, or I'm going back
into the hurricane.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.967
-Dorothy... I'm sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.500
I'm just so glad to have my mother
and my sister back.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.734
(laughs)

21:40.800 --> 21:43.500
-Aren't they cute?
-Yeah, and I've had them both.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.300
(laughs)

21:49.667 --> 21:50.967
You're right, Dorothy.

21:51.033 --> 21:52.200
He is a pig.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.900
Sophia, I'm so glad you're safe.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.734
I have some good news.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.767
The hurricane is breaking up.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.834
We're only going to have to stay here
a few more hours.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.166
I'm going to tell everybody.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.166
Don't. First, we sell them candy.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.834
Come on, everybody.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.500
Dorothy, I want to talk to you.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.100
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about the stick.

22:17.900 --> 22:18.934
What stick?

22:19.033 --> 22:22.100
The one with the sock
and buttons for eyes.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.433
You mean Scout?

22:25.367 --> 22:27.367
You know where Scout is?

22:28.500 --> 22:31.066
I'm sorry I gave it to your sister
when you were a kid

22:31.567 --> 22:33.900
and about the other thing.

22:33.967 --> 22:36.400
You mean about giving Stan to Gloria?

22:36.467 --> 22:39.400
That and the stick.
Sorry about those two things.

22:39.867 --> 22:41.266
You know what, Ma?

22:41.333 --> 22:46.133
I love you, and I'm glad you're safe,
and I forgive you.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.033
-You make me sick.
-Oh.

22:50.633 --> 22:54.934
(upbeat music playing)

22:55.967 --> 22:58.967
(closing theme music playing)
