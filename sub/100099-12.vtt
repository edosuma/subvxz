00:01.392 --> 00:02.915
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.959 --> 00:06.484
I helped Lex bring you back
for the sake of the future.

00:06.528 --> 00:10.140
Another Brainiac told me
that it was absolutely critical

00:10.184 --> 00:13.056
that I help Lex
in complete secrecy.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.406
Yes, it may be too late
for you, Father,

00:15.450 --> 00:17.930
but soon I will accomplish
what you could not.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.454
I will live forever.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.240
Forty-two!

00:23.284 --> 00:25.938
What? They don't have these
in the 30th century.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.897
I can get Al
to make you up a bunch

00:27.940 --> 00:29.464
and you can take 'em with you
if you like.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.770
Or you can just keep eating
until the kitchen runs out.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.425
Then you'd be able to stay
for one more song.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.253
Once the Legion ship has power,
I gotta go.

00:36.297 --> 00:39.256
Speaking of which,
you never told us
what your Legion call sign is.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.605
-I didn't?
-No.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.303
It's not a big deal.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.521
Are you kidding?

00:43.565 --> 00:44.914
Uh, according to Brainy,

00:44.957 --> 00:47.090
before every Legion member
puts on his vestments,

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
he must have a call sign.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.746
"Computer Lad."

00:50.789 --> 00:52.704
-Huh.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.967
-What?
-You know, it's a hop,
skip, and a jump

00:55.011 --> 00:56.665
from Cat Grant's IT guy.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.102
-Wow.
-Why is "Computer Lad"
your name?

00:59.146 --> 01:02.018
It's not "Martian Manhunter"
or whatever, sure,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.455
but Legionnaires' names speak
to who they are, right?

01:04.498 --> 01:07.023
So, Chemical King has power
for chemicals,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.764
Lightning Lass controls
electricity.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.983
One day,
my brother-in-law decides
to call me "Computer Lad,"

01:11.027 --> 01:12.115
and it kind of stuck.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.856
And, I don't know,
I kind of like it.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.118
- Okay.
-It's nice.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.467
-Kara.
- Yeah.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.817
You invited William.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.428
It... It's nothing.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.082
After game night,
I couldn't not.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.996
Karaoke's all night,
so come on up, guys.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.433
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.478
Kara, you didn't tell me
it was karaoke night.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.524
Is karaoke your thing?

01:29.567 --> 01:33.005
Clearly, you've never heard
my rendition of "Africa"
by Toto.

01:33.049 --> 01:37.097
Oh! Kara has been threatening
to do that one for a long time.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.099
-I haven't.
-So, we're gonna
do it together?

01:41.144 --> 01:44.278

01:44.321 --> 01:48.804

02:31.977 --> 02:33.936
I heard about Lex sneaking
past the government security

02:33.979 --> 02:35.285
to probe the Legion ship.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.069
He must be driving you crazy.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.551
I mean, not even Winn
could find anything unturned
on the ship.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.727
I know that
he is up to something.

02:42.771 --> 02:47.079
Which is why
I uploaded some spyware
onto my DEO intranet.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.995
That way, whatever he does,
I will see.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.302
Alex, I'm proud of you
for staying to fight
the good fight,

02:52.346 --> 02:54.217
but I do worry.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.610
Well, you don't have to

02:55.653 --> 02:57.612
because I can handle myself.

02:57.655 --> 03:00.310
And, plus,
Brainy's got my back.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.271
Mr. Luthor.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.925
I uploaded you the file
on Gemma Cooper.

03:06.969 --> 03:10.451
Excellent. Now you're free
to help with
the Alex Danvers problem.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.365
Problem?

03:11.408 --> 03:12.540
She's been spying on me.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.237
She hasn't interfered
with our work,

03:14.281 --> 03:16.065
but if she does,

03:16.108 --> 03:19.024
it might require
more permanent actions.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.591
Help her control herself.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.332
Now, is everything
quiet there?

03:22.985 --> 03:24.334
Of course.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.424
No disruptions
or technical difficulties?

03:27.859 --> 03:29.121
No.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.079
Good.

03:30.775 --> 03:31.776
Keep me posted.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.154
I'm on my way.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.634
911 at the DEO.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.897
-I'll track it.
-Oh. I... I'll join you.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.203
I thought you were leaving.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.813
You guys bailed me out.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.859
No, I'm not leaving
this century
without repaying you.

04:10.902 --> 04:11.860
What don't you do well?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.209
Are you kidding me?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.211
With those harmonies?
Where did that come from?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.168
With a partner like you,
it's easy.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.737
Would you, uh...

04:19.781 --> 04:21.391
Would you like to
go out sometime?

04:21.870 --> 04:22.871
Just us.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.046
Like a date?

04:24.089 --> 04:25.177
A date.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.091
What do you think?

04:26.701 --> 04:27.658
Hey, Super--

04:27.702 --> 04:28.659
-Kara.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:28.703 --> 04:29.660
She is super.

04:29.704 --> 04:30.966
-Sure.
-Um,

04:31.009 --> 04:34.448
Alex needs you at...
your grandmother's house.

04:34.491 --> 04:37.494
You know, your D... ear...

04:37.538 --> 04:39.888
Old Gran Gran's house,
like, immediately.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.846
Is everything all right?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.152
Yeah. She's just been feeling
under the weather.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.196
I should really go.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.328
-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.242
Yeah.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.269
How is that coming
through our comms?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.272
I used to listen to this song
in the shop when I was a kid...

05:17.404 --> 05:18.709
with my dad.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.537
Okay, wait, so you're saying...

05:20.581 --> 05:22.496
I think Toyman's back.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.551
What do you mean,
not a bug from Toyman?

05:34.595 --> 05:35.726
What else could it be?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.206
Initially, I thought
the drone outburst

05:37.249 --> 05:39.034
was just some bad code
in our surveillance software,

05:39.077 --> 05:40.122
but this,

05:40.165 --> 05:41.732
this is in our whole system.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.386
So, it's a virus?

05:43.430 --> 05:45.693
More like
artificial intelligence.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.477
Whoa, that's why
he was playing the song.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.174
This is my dad.

05:49.218 --> 05:52.221
The last thing that
he was working on was
a version of this.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.919
A way to put his whole mind
into the digital space.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.618
He... He wanted to
become hyper conscious.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.272
If he could become immortal
in the World Wide Web,

06:00.316 --> 06:02.753
he would be the ultimate player
in the ultimate playground.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.277
Once there, he could commit
any act of violence.

06:05.321 --> 06:09.630
Any time, any place,
air traffic, hospitals,
US Nuclear Command.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.110
But you said your dad
was still working on it, so--

06:12.154 --> 06:14.112
And, plus,
this Toyman isn't him,

06:14.156 --> 06:16.680
okay, so how could he
be doing what your father
was trying to do?

06:16.724 --> 06:20.380
Lenses. This Toyman has
the Obsidian Platinum lenses.

06:20.423 --> 06:24.296
Storage vault.
Bring up item 906016.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.865
I noted something
on this video of our
final meeting with Toyman.

06:27.909 --> 06:28.997
There.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.433
See, Toyman uses
the Obsidian lenses

06:30.477 --> 06:32.130
to download himself
onto a laptop.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.698
Didn't we confiscate a laptop
and bring it back here?

06:41.357 --> 06:43.707
The hardware's clean
but there's
a compartmentalized drive.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.622
That would make it appear
to be off while still working.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.450
Toyman found a way
to leap into our Internet

06:47.494 --> 06:49.670
and bypass the DEO's firewall
to the outside.

06:49.713 --> 06:52.455
-Okay, so do we have
a fix for this?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.152
Yeah. My dad's code.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.807
I think I can
reverse-engineer it
into a kill code.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.026
- Lockdown.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.070
Lockdown.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.855
Lockdown.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.117
-Lockdown.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.248
Lockdown.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.427
Don't you guys know it's rude
to talk about someone
behind their back?

07:07.470 --> 07:08.558
Toyman?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.168
Okay, tell me
this is a video, guys.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.910
Oh, no, I am everything
I used to be,

07:12.954 --> 07:15.391
but electronic and immortal.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.655
Now, lower the DEO's firewall
to the World Wide Web

07:18.699 --> 07:22.354
or I will use
all of your toys to kill you.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.453
He's taking control
of our laser defenses.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.606
Did you kill it?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.390
No. I just knocked him
out of the command center.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.653
So he can come back?

07:59.696 --> 08:01.829
Oh, he can, and will.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.836
Okay.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.360
I want us to round up
every item this thing
can use against us,

08:11.403 --> 08:13.057
guns, comm links,

08:13.101 --> 08:15.973
anything with a Bluetooth
that can connect
to our intranet,

08:16.017 --> 08:17.540
and I want it evacuated.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.890
As long as
there's technology here
this AI can access,

08:19.934 --> 08:21.065
we are sitting ducks.

08:21.109 --> 08:21.936
Go.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.592
I'll gather gear too.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.159
Once we've got everything,
I can fly it outside
of Toyman's signal range.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.073
Okay.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.859
Brainy, can you isolate the AI?

08:31.902 --> 08:33.121
I pushed him down
from the command center

08:33.164 --> 08:34.948
to the server level
under a virtual lid.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.690
-But he's still fighting
to get back up here.

08:36.732 --> 08:37.908
Look.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.736
Well, what if he breaks
through the lid?

08:39.780 --> 08:43.260
There is a 92.6% chance
he'll make his way
onto the World Wide Web.

08:43.304 --> 08:46.047
When he's there,
he can attack... everything.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.440
Okay, well, what if Supergirl
goes down to the server level

08:48.484 --> 08:50.007
and fries everything?

08:50.051 --> 08:52.009
The servers are located
on top of the DEO's power core.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.794
If they melt,
so does the core.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.231
It would vaporize all life
within a three-mile radius.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.281
Do you hear that?

09:03.325 --> 09:04.587
Is that
an old-fashioned telephone?

09:10.637 --> 09:11.768
Um...

09:12.769 --> 09:13.683
Okay.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.167
Director Danvers, why is
my DEO on lockdown tonight?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.472
It's Toyman, sir.

09:20.516 --> 09:21.386
Toyman?

09:21.430 --> 09:23.171
I thought he was dead.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.434
Yes, well, apparently,
he has uploaded himself
into our system.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.523
It took us all
completely by surprise.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.611
Clearly.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.352
Can you sequester the AI?

09:30.395 --> 09:33.137
The last thing
this world needs is
a rogue Toyman on the Web.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.225
We're trying.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.140
And in the meantime,
just in case,

09:36.184 --> 09:37.577
I'm gathering
all of our smart tech

09:37.620 --> 09:39.927
to have Supergirl
fly it out immediately.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.102
I know it's a risk,

09:41.145 --> 09:42.451
but if anyone can
do the job, it's her.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.496
But she can't.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.848
In case you've forgotten,
rogue Kryptonians have
attacked our planet before.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.067
The DEO has
Kryptonite safeguards in place,

09:50.111 --> 09:52.156
and, no,
they cannot be disabled.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.420
Well, we have anti-Kryptonite
technology to protect her.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.684
I think you're remembering that
from another time.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.163
Another Earth, perhaps.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.339
I have a split shift crew.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.168
You want the 12 of us
to go around the entire DEO

10:04.212 --> 10:05.996
to dismantle all of our tech

10:06.040 --> 10:09.304
and hope that Toyman
doesn't regain control
while we do it?

10:09.347 --> 10:12.133
National safety is
our primary responsibility,

10:12.176 --> 10:14.439
and that is why you have to do
everything in your power

10:14.483 --> 10:16.746
to neutralize that thing
and not let it get out.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.878
Are we understood?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.096
Yes, sir.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.837
Good. Keep me posted.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.626
Winn.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.945
Agent Dox. I was wondering
when you'd call.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.513
You knew Toyman would
upload himself into the DEO.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.428
I correctly theorized it, yes.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.516
And you didn't tell me.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.604
It was need-to-know.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.127
And now that you do know,

10:50.171 --> 10:52.564
you need to know,
I want you to get me
Toyman's code.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.654
What Toyman used
to put himself
into the computer.

10:55.785 --> 10:56.960
Why?

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
So we can beat Leviathan
at their own game.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.921
They are the greatest threat
this planet faces.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.837
And you want their immortality.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.274
It's the one advantage
they have over me.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.363
With this code, I can
level the playing field.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.452
As soon as you can make sure
no one is watching,

11:10.495 --> 11:12.715
access Toyman's code
and copy it.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.892
Once you are done,
you'll have gotten us
one step closer

11:15.936 --> 11:17.111
to saving the world.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.062
What was that?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.412
I've never been allergic
to lobster before.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.762
The Bio-Link on the lenses
still isn't working.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.591
Look, eating virtually
still provides the body
with nutrients,

12:02.634 --> 12:06.900
but the interface
is hyper-stimulating
the body's sensory reaction

12:06.943 --> 12:09.250
into a kind of toxic shock.

12:11.643 --> 12:15.125
Last week, we were
this close to perfecting
Obsidian Platinum.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.606
We need to fix this.

12:17.649 --> 12:18.955
- Miss Rojas,

12:18.999 --> 12:20.522
Lena Luthor is waiting
in your office.

12:27.094 --> 12:27.921
Lena.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.662
Twice in one week.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.273
It's getting to be
like old times.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.970
Well, I know
you're gearing up for
the Platinum launch

12:34.014 --> 12:36.756
and I was hoping
I could get a preview.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.975
I loved
your first-generation lenses.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.499
They were helpful to me
in so many ways.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.849
So maybe I could get a peek?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.024
Of course.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.635
Except, we're not
quite ready yet.

12:47.854 --> 12:48.768
Oh.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.161
Is everything all right?

12:51.205 --> 12:53.337
Yes, nothing major. Just, uh...

12:53.381 --> 12:55.905
a small issue
with the Bio-Link algorithm.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.212
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.868
You know, maybe I can help.

13:01.911 --> 13:05.436
Luthor Corp's been working
with the Pentagon
on a new neural interface.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.177
We've just developed
a special processor

13:07.221 --> 13:09.614
that regulates Bio-Linking
across a wide spectrum.

13:09.658 --> 13:13.140
It's completely eliminated
the feedback loop, gotten
most of the side effects.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.533
Well, that's impressive,
but we're not the Pentagon.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.971
And that's a good thing.
The Pentagon just dropped out,

13:18.014 --> 13:20.712
leaving us with perhaps
the perfect interface for you.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.192
So what do you say?

13:22.236 --> 13:24.934
We help Obsidian North
revolutionize virtual reality?

13:25.892 --> 13:26.762
I appreciate the offer,

13:28.024 --> 13:29.721
but our last attempt
at collaboration

13:29.765 --> 13:31.288
almost ruined everything
between us.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.509
I don't wanna risk that.

13:35.423 --> 13:36.250
You're right.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.036
But let me know
if you change your mind.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.559
The offer still stands.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.473
I will.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.655
There is only one place
I think the AI can be.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.876
In a prime server tower down
in the sub-basement corridor.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.574
Now, the way that we find
which server the Toyman is on,

13:56.618 --> 14:00.927
is to physically go down
into the corridors
and search for it.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.798
Luckily,
we had this in storage.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.061
Van Eck radiation scanner.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.237
It's delinked from our intranet

14:07.281 --> 14:09.892
and able to distinguish
between normal server radiation
and abnormal radiation,

14:09.936 --> 14:12.068
thereby allowing us
to pinpoint Toyman.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.331
Accordingly, I shall head
into the corridors.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.898
No, Brainy,
we need you up here

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
in case Toyman tries to get
in the command center again.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.119
I'll go.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.947
Uh, not without me.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.383
Are you sure
you're up for this?

14:22.426 --> 14:23.514
This is my enemy.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.212
It's my problem.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.606
Plus, I'm the only one
that knows the code.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.738
Okay, fine.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.914
Winn, Supergirl,
go for the servers,

14:31.958 --> 14:34.134
Brainy, you keep him
at bay digitally,

14:34.177 --> 14:36.919
and I will make sure
that he doesn't get ahold
of any of our tech.

14:36.963 --> 14:40.923
You know, it's so funny
because we have all these
eyes and ears in there

14:40.967 --> 14:43.447
looking and listening
all the time, but...

14:44.057 --> 14:45.362
who is watching who?

14:51.194 --> 14:52.152
Brainy.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.591
I need to know.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.680
Is this another step
in one of Lex's plans?

15:01.901 --> 15:05.948
Lex did help manipulate
Toyman's digital reemergence

15:05.992 --> 15:07.645
but I had nothing
to do with it.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.953
Helping Lex is
what I have to do
for the sake of the future.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.085
You know that.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.436
Still, I promise

15:15.479 --> 15:16.872
I have everything
under control.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.742
Okay.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.136
I am trusting you.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.275
Doppio espresso.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.451
To cheer you up?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.583
What makes you think
I need cheering up?

15:32.627 --> 15:36.413
Well, you're trying to
advance your grand project.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.763
The Q-waves from
the archive cube had helped,

15:38.807 --> 15:41.897
but the next step remains...

15:42.419 --> 15:43.855
elusive.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.032
A Lex who cares about
the emotional state of others.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.165
This really is
a whole new world.

15:49.209 --> 15:52.081
I care because
your goals are my goals.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.562
Ah, it does always come back
to you, doesn't it?

15:56.216 --> 15:59.001
But, yes, with the exception
of field testing,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.569
my Non Nocere
algorithm is almost ready.

16:01.612 --> 16:02.700
Just...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.354
need a distribution device

16:04.398 --> 16:06.574
so I can get it to
as many people as possible
all at once.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.882
I thought I'd come to
an agreement with Andrea
this evening, but--

16:10.926 --> 16:13.189
She said no.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.671
I have to say, Andrea was
always a bit short-sighted.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.369
Perhaps there's something
I can do?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.067
I don't need
anyone murdered, Lex.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.330
I have other skill sets.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.766
Plus, we're partners.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.247
Let me help.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.466
Wait, are you actually
asking my permission?

16:29.510 --> 16:30.946
It's a whole new world.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.344
Fine.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.614
Nice one.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.745
Well, I try.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.356
I just wish
you didn't have to

16:49.399 --> 16:51.749
on account of my dad's
global insanity nightmare--

16:51.793 --> 16:53.882
It's not your fault.

16:53.925 --> 16:56.058
Actually, it kinda is.

16:57.451 --> 17:00.106
When I told you guys that
I remembered my dad's code,

17:01.890 --> 17:03.239
I'm the one
that came up with it.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.111
Look, I thought
it would be cool.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.590
Why just play a video game,
you know, when you can
be inside of one?

17:07.635 --> 17:10.029
I'd stay up past midnight
trying to think
of different ways

17:10.071 --> 17:13.858
to express Premack's theory
of the mind in this
little blue notebook.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.383
My dad finally caught me
with it and asked me
what it was.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.124
I thought he was getting mad,
but he seemed...

17:18.906 --> 17:21.127
He seemed proud.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.215
Of course, now I know
it wasn't pride, it was greed.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.261
The night the police finally
came and took him away,

17:25.305 --> 17:26.306
I went to look
for the notebook.

17:26.348 --> 17:27.307
It was gone.

17:27.349 --> 17:28.873
Turns out that
he had taken it

17:28.917 --> 17:31.702
and left in its place
a little toy monkey.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.226
I'm sorry.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.054
Ah, it... It's fine.
Let's talk about
something else.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.230
Hey. You and William.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.361
-What's with that?
-What?

17:38.405 --> 17:39.754
I totally messed him
asking you out.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.495
-What? No, no. That was not...
-I messed that up.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.800
Well, he wasn't...

17:42.844 --> 17:45.151
-There's... There is
nothing there.
-What?

17:45.194 --> 17:47.283
I'm sorry, but even
in the 30th century,

17:47.327 --> 17:50.895
harmonizing that beautifully
with someone is a definitive
sign of something there.

17:50.939 --> 17:54.116
Maybe I like him.
I don't... I don't know.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.857
The truth is,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.251
given who I am
and the secrets I keep,

17:58.294 --> 18:00.514
I'm not sure I can
even have a relationship.

18:00.557 --> 18:03.125
My double life blew up
my friendship with Lena.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.431
So how am I supposed
to date someone?

18:04.474 --> 18:06.824
Just because Lena reacted
the way that she did

18:06.868 --> 18:08.435
does not mean
that other people will.

18:08.478 --> 18:11.481
Maybe so, but I refuse
to start any relationship
on a lie.

18:11.525 --> 18:15.137
William asked you out
on one date, Kara.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.313
You don't even know
if it's gonna go anywhere,

18:17.357 --> 18:19.576
but you won't find out
unless you try.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.013
And then if it does,
you know, just...

18:22.057 --> 18:23.319
take it one step at a time.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.974
One step at a time, huh?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.149
-That's right.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.107
-Whoa.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.723
So we've got
the command center cleared.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.333
But if Toyman comes back,

18:37.377 --> 18:39.596
we cannot let him
get his digital hands
on any of this.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.165
So, Squad 1, I want you
to pop the chips
out of every smart gun.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.428
Squad 2, do the same
with communication tech.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.388
Squad 3,
delink everything else.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.564
We've really outsmarted
ourselves here, haven't we?

18:51.304 --> 18:52.392
All right, get to work.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.049
Everyone, keep working.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.094
I'll check it out.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.367
Breach!

19:16.720 --> 19:17.678
I think Toyman's
this way.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.512
Toyman?

19:27.078 --> 19:28.254
Winslow.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.429
At last you're here.

19:30.734 --> 19:31.561
Dad.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
The song. I...
I knew it was you.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.353
Winn, I had to
get your attention.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.658
Oh, you got my attention.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.094
-No, no. I'm here to help.
-No. Don't.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.096
Explain yourself.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.316
Winn knows.
Digitizing my consciousness
was my dream.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.013
Yeah. A dream you stole.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.494
Fine. But when that
other Winn digitized himself,

19:51.538 --> 19:55.063
he used the underlying code
that I'd written,
plus my hardware.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.544
Now, I managed to translate
80% of myself,

19:57.587 --> 19:59.981
but he must have paired it with some sort of future tech,

20:00.024 --> 20:02.070
because when he came online,
I did too.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.419
And now you wanna help us?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.943
Yes. I'm trapped
in a backup drive,

20:05.987 --> 20:08.207
and the only way
I can do anything is
if you release me.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.643
I'm sorry. Are you insane?

20:09.686 --> 20:11.122
Oh, wait, yes.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.689
Clinically, you are.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.648
If we let him go,
he will do what he always does

20:14.691 --> 20:16.258
and wreak havoc everywhere.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.520
That's not true!

20:17.564 --> 20:19.653
I mean,
it was my original plan,

20:19.696 --> 20:23.047
but this other Winn is planning to do things that are
beyond the pale.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.658
I've seen it in his code.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.529
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm going to delete
both of you.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.574
But I wanna help.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.445
And you can't beat him alone.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.318
Supergirl, Winn,

20:32.361 --> 20:34.363
apparently, three of
Toyman's sentries are headed
for you as we speak.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.886
What kind of sentries?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.801
It seems that before
Toyman's AI got into our net,

20:37.845 --> 20:40.282
it got into
some flying monkeys.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.155
Supergirl, go this way.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.548
-You'll be safe.

20:45.592 --> 20:49.248
No, no, you are not fooling us.
Not now, not ever.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.946
There is a service corridor
behind this wall.

20:51.989 --> 20:52.947
Winslow, no!

21:10.617 --> 21:12.923
Forgive my boldness
at this hour.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.839
It's just I saw you
across the room
and knew I had to pounce.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.102
Lex Luthor.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.409
You should be careful
where you pounce.

21:20.453 --> 21:21.976
You never know
what you might find.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.980
Oh, but I do know
who you are.

21:26.807 --> 21:27.851
Gemma Cooper.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.679
Board chair of Obsidian North,

21:29.723 --> 21:32.987
renowned computer scientist
with excellent taste
in wine, horses,

21:33.030 --> 21:34.554
and business opportunities.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.819
What kind of opportunities?

21:38.862 --> 21:42.344
Mmm. The kind that can satisfy
both Obsidian North
and Luthor Corp.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.304
Funny. I don't think
there is much
we had in common.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.481
Oh. I'd think a woman
of your vision and insight

21:48.524 --> 21:50.700
would be able to see
past the superficial.

21:50.744 --> 21:55.226
You have an interface issue
with the Obsidian Platinum
Bio-Link.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.011
Today, my sister offered
to help fix it.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.362
Your CEO rejected her offer

22:00.406 --> 22:02.495
because she let her feelings
determine her business moves,

22:02.538 --> 22:04.323
and I think you're
smarter than that.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.021
You're suggesting that we get
into bed with Luther Corp?

22:08.414 --> 22:10.111
Since when is that smart?

22:10.154 --> 22:13.070
Whenever it comes to
doing business anywhere
on this planet.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.942
You have amazing technology--

22:14.985 --> 22:16.987
At least you almost do.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.468
We have allies and assets,

22:19.512 --> 22:22.993
government stooges
and supporters
in every corner of the globe.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.779
That's the kind of reach
you can't get with just
a snap of your fingers.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.477
So you have the potential,

22:28.521 --> 22:30.349
but we can help you realize it.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.656
And what do you expect
to get back in exchange
for this "help"?

22:33.700 --> 22:37.312
The tech field can only hold
so many players.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.968
Sooner or later,
there might not be room
for the both of us.

22:41.011 --> 22:44.275
Why be at each other's throats
when we could be
joined at the hip?

22:44.972 --> 22:46.277
Who knows,

22:46.321 --> 22:47.801
we might like it.

22:47.844 --> 22:50.194
I can be an excellent friend

22:50.238 --> 22:51.500
when I want to be.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.720
And I do want
to be your friend...

22:54.938 --> 22:55.983
for a long time.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.120
Are you okay?

23:03.164 --> 23:04.644
I know the last time
you saw your father
was pretty horrible.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.863
Trusting him never leads
to anything good.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.692
I get that,
but "never" is a big word.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.695
J'onn recently found himself
in a blood feud
with his brother

23:12.739 --> 23:15.002
where he said they would
never make amends,

23:15.045 --> 23:16.525
and now they're brothers
that support each other.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.485
Yeah, well, good for J'onn,

23:19.528 --> 23:21.922
but I am not trusting
Toyman No. 1 or 2
until they are both deleted.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.317
Director Danvers,

23:26.361 --> 23:28.145
the rest of the tablets
have been delinked.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.582
Permission to delink yours?

23:29.625 --> 23:32.106
Um, no,
I'll take care of that,
thank you.

23:43.944 --> 23:44.988
You son of a...

24:03.137 --> 24:04.181
Brainy.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.402
What the hell were you
doing in my account?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.063
I trusted you
with that spyware.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.760
And you hacked into my tablet

24:17.804 --> 24:21.242
and you overrode my commands
and you deleted it.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.505
Just tell me I'm wrong!

24:23.549 --> 24:24.463
You're not wrong.

24:26.073 --> 24:26.943
I did it.

24:26.987 --> 24:27.857
I knew it.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.599
You know what?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.775
Ever since those other Brainys
got you to take off
your inhibitors,

24:32.819 --> 24:34.473
you have been acting different,

24:34.516 --> 24:37.127
and it's not some
personality different.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.956
It's like you're
hiding something.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.915
Like you've got
some secret plan.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.222
I did it
to protect you, Alex.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.746
Come on.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.574
Sooner or later,
Lex would have
found your spyware,

24:48.617 --> 24:49.923
he would have traced it
back to your account--

24:49.966 --> 24:51.098
I knew the risk.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.013
It isn't a risk, it's a fact.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.754
Look, if this Toyman fiasco's
taught us anything,

24:54.797 --> 24:57.539
it's that technology,
no matter how sophisticated,

24:57.583 --> 24:59.628
can be used against us.

24:59.672 --> 25:00.977
It's just a matter of when.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.894
I should have told you first.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.768
But I refuse to let
Lex come after you.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.087
Gemma.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.045
Is everything all right?

25:25.088 --> 25:27.177
Apparently not.

25:27.221 --> 25:30.180
According to Lex Luthor,
our interface isn't working,

25:30.224 --> 25:32.269
and it's generating
catastrophic results.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.184
Um, look,
that's an overstatement.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.665
And when you were
given the opportunity
to team up with them

25:36.709 --> 25:38.058
to fix this issue,

25:38.580 --> 25:40.669
you passed.

25:40.713 --> 25:44.891
The Luthors may have
a slight scientific edge,
but...

25:44.934 --> 25:48.068
Lena and I have not had
the best relationship
in the past.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.853
This isn't about
your friendship with Lena.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.681
It's about staying focused
on the business

25:52.725 --> 25:55.118
that your father spent
his life building,

25:55.162 --> 25:57.381
that you yourself have brought
to the precipice

25:57.425 --> 25:59.993
of one of the biggest
tech advancements in history.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.125
I know where we stand.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.910
Then I don't need to remind you
of all the other relationships
you've abandoned

26:03.953 --> 26:05.476
to get this
where it needs to be.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.002
The Luthors can help us.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.312
In college,

26:15.356 --> 26:17.706
when I agreed
to be your mentor,

26:17.750 --> 26:20.317
it was because I believed
you would never back down.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.756
Maybe I was wrong.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.473
Lena?

26:45.516 --> 26:46.343
It's Andrea.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.173
I think I've changed my mind.

26:50.217 --> 26:51.479
This is it.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.959
-Toyman's prime server.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.090
So,
what happens now?

26:55.135 --> 26:56.440
In a few clicks,

26:56.484 --> 26:58.399
this will all be over.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.531
Is everything okay?

27:01.489 --> 27:03.709
Code is not entering.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.625
Brainy.

27:06.668 --> 27:07.626
-Have you found the server?
- Yeah, we did,

27:07.669 --> 27:09.018
but we're having a problem.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.977
What is it?

27:11.020 --> 27:13.153
Every time I try to enter
the kill code, it keeps
getting bounced back.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.507
It seems Toyman's AI is
growing too strong for you

27:19.550 --> 27:21.465
to access it anywhere
outside the server.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.729
But how else do we access it?

27:23.772 --> 27:24.904
I have to go inside it.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.212
I have this
from the Legion ship.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.215
It allows me to enter
the digital space temporarily.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.435
If you go inside it,
can't you run into--

27:34.478 --> 27:37.960
My dad, or Toyman,
or... both.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.222
Yeah.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.051
What was that?

27:53.149 --> 27:55.021
We have Lexosuits?

27:55.064 --> 27:56.675
Toyman's AI
is inside of them.
Get out now.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.352
They're breaking out.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.224
Toyman's tech is trying
to escape.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.312
If it succeeds,

28:25.355 --> 28:27.053
there is a 100% chance

28:27.096 --> 28:30.186
that Toyman will be able to weaponize the entire Internet.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.927
Go. I can do this.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.973
-But your father--
-It's only code, okay?

28:34.016 --> 28:35.626
And this is simple.
I go to it,

28:35.670 --> 28:38.281
I enter the kill code,
and then I get out.
I can do this.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.979
I mean, I have to do this.

28:40.022 --> 28:40.893
Don't forget...

28:41.632 --> 28:42.808
I'm Computer Lad.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.001
Okay, what doesn't belong?

29:13.621 --> 29:15.057
Gotcha.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.103
-Winn!

29:17.146 --> 29:19.496
You... You shouldn't be
in here by yourself.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.108
You won't be able
to hold him back alone.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.283
You need me!

29:23.326 --> 29:25.024
I do not need you!

29:28.288 --> 29:29.115
Tag!

29:31.465 --> 29:32.683
You're it.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.295
Open the doors
with the palm lock, son.

29:35.338 --> 29:38.211
Just reach up
and do it.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.256
Trust me, I've... I've changed!

29:40.300 --> 29:42.432
You can't trust him.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.000
I did all of this for him,

29:45.044 --> 29:46.872
and look how he treats me.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.569
That's because you're a psycho!

30:20.949 --> 30:22.168
I got you. I got you.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.314
Supergirl, you have to
get away from here.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.012
I'm not leaving this fight.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.970
Don't be crazy.
This isn't some time
to stick to some code.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.542
Unless you're them.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.370
Toyman may be controlling
our technology,

30:50.413 --> 30:53.199
but that tech still keys
on sound, motion,
and brightness.

30:53.242 --> 30:57.768
Accordingly, if I become
the brightest and the loudest
in the room,

30:57.812 --> 30:59.335
then I'll be
the tech's only target.

30:59.379 --> 31:02.034
And if it's focused on you,
we can focus on it.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.603
Moths to a flame.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.693
Winn! Just... Just let go!

31:09.737 --> 31:11.391
He's right.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.261
Let go.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.873
The fall will kill you.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.399
Just let go

31:19.442 --> 31:20.791
because in here...

31:24.491 --> 31:25.927
you can!

31:41.203 --> 31:44.119
Leeroy Jenkins!

31:58.481 --> 32:01.354
Winn,
please, just let me out

32:01.397 --> 32:02.964
and we can stop him together!

32:03.008 --> 32:03.965
No way!

32:05.836 --> 32:08.361
Even this dummy knows
you're lying, Dad.

32:08.752 --> 32:09.840
He knows.

32:09.884 --> 32:12.321
If I get deleted, so do you.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.933
All right. When I said
I changed, I lied.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.370
I haven't changed in here,

32:17.413 --> 32:22.201
but I have learned
looking through
the DEO's files here

32:22.244 --> 32:25.856
and all the good things
you've done for your friends
and for the world.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.772
And it made me so proud, son.

32:28.816 --> 32:32.646
I mean, I've always said
that you and I are alike,
but that... that's not true.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.736
No. We're almost nothing alike.

32:37.303 --> 32:41.394
You're simply
the best part of me.

32:41.437 --> 32:45.006
If there was ever a time
to... to take a leap,

32:45.050 --> 32:46.051
it's now.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.053
And like I said,

32:48.096 --> 32:50.577
in here, you can do anything.
Look out!

32:57.888 --> 32:59.368
Go on, son!

32:59.412 --> 33:01.109
Finish entering the code.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.137
Game over.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.012
Supergirl, he's
trying to escape!

33:38.059 --> 33:39.104
Not today.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.635
No! No, stop!

33:51.986 --> 33:53.292
Dad?

33:53.335 --> 33:54.380
Finish it, son!

33:55.120 --> 33:56.512
It's the only way!

34:09.569 --> 34:10.396
Winn?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.092
I'm here.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.051
Are you okay?

34:16.706 --> 34:18.186
My dad saved me.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.581
He was telling the truth.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.195
Sometimes, people
can surprise us.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.954
Nice to
see you back at work.

34:49.391 --> 34:52.393
How did you access my phone?
I have this room shielded.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.918
Just a little bit of tech
I've been working on.

34:54.962 --> 34:58.008
But, really, I just
wanted to see if you'd
sorted things with Andrea.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.575
Clearly you have.

34:59.619 --> 35:00.750
You know the words
you want to hear me say,
"Thank you."

35:01.490 --> 35:03.275
Well, thank you.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.233
You said you'd bring
Andrea around, and you did.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.582
It was my pleasure.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.280
Though, it's still a mystery

35:08.323 --> 35:11.413
why Obsidian's tech
malfunctioned
in the first place.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.372
I suppose
it was just fortuitous

35:13.415 --> 35:15.591
that you were
in the right place
to make the right move.

35:15.635 --> 35:16.549
Is it really?

35:16.592 --> 35:18.464
Oh, Lena.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.248
I am impressed.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.337
Sabotaging your friend
to get what you want.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.252
Not to get what I want.
For the good of humanity.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.385
Ah, of course.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.126
But that is exactly
the kind of thinking

35:28.169 --> 35:30.345
we're going to need
to defeat Leviathan.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.565
Your big brother
is proud of you.

35:32.608 --> 35:35.307
I don't suppose my big brother
wants to tell me what he did
to bring Andrea around.

35:35.350 --> 35:38.962
I just made friends
with an Obsidian board chair,
Gemma Cooper.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.661
If you ask me,
she'll be a friend to us both
for a long time.

35:51.888 --> 35:56.023
Please tell the Anointed One
the Luthors are right
where we want them.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.420
She will be most pleased.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.074
Here is all
the Kryptonite from the DEO.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.816
That's the Lexosuits
and the lockdown shields.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.557
Everything that we could grab.

36:08.601 --> 36:12.170
I can still send
all of it into the sun.

36:12.213 --> 36:15.564
Speaking of space, Alex,
I may have some
Martian eavesdropping tech

36:15.608 --> 36:18.176
that Lex may find
hard to uncover,
if you're interested.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.916
Well, you should
give it to Brainy...

36:20.961 --> 36:22.136
'cause I'm quitting the DEO.

36:22.702 --> 36:23.790
Alex, really?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.792
Lex is everywhere in there,

36:25.835 --> 36:28.490
and I can't keep showing up
and smiling at him,

36:28.534 --> 36:30.840
and... Even if
it's just pretend.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.016
Plus, now you can come
and work with me.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.540
National City may need
the tower,

36:34.583 --> 36:36.542
but the tower needs leaders.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.500
Could be fun.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.023
Fun and logical.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.983
Brainy, you should come too.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.767
I mean, why not
just work here?

36:44.811 --> 36:47.683
Ironically, the logic
that dictates you must leave

36:48.771 --> 36:50.817
also dictates
that I must stay...

36:52.427 --> 36:54.603
to provide you all
with eyes and ears
around Lex.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.475
Your friends are always
gonna have your back, Brainy.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.478
And you, Winn, how are you?

36:59.521 --> 37:00.653
Oh, you know.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.090
Ready to go home.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.962
-Being here with you guys

37:06.006 --> 37:09.314
has, I mean...
It... It's helped me

37:09.357 --> 37:11.620
a lot more than
the future ever could have.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.970
Just... It's just helped me

37:14.014 --> 37:16.712
get over my dad
and, you know, his crimes,

37:16.756 --> 37:20.107
just my past,
all of it. So...

37:21.326 --> 37:22.240
Thank you.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.545
-Come on.

37:26.374 --> 37:27.593
It's been good to see you.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.768
All right.
Come here. Come here.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.248
Ah, we'll see you soon,
Computer Lad.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.251
No!  Okay, okay.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.687
Listen.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.080
It's not Computer Lad
anymore, all right?

37:37.124 --> 37:38.256
From now on...

37:39.996 --> 37:40.997
it's Toyman.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.043
Winn, seriously?

37:43.739 --> 37:45.567
Yeah.

37:45.611 --> 37:48.831
You guys, when I told you
that I was okay
being called Computer Lad,

37:48.875 --> 37:51.704
are you kidding me?
No, I hated that.
"Computer Lad."

37:51.747 --> 37:53.053
-No.

37:53.401 --> 37:54.272
What?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.143
But "Toyman..."

37:57.666 --> 37:59.189
You know, that name has
always haunted me.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.368
But now after having faced
my father...

38:05.195 --> 38:06.936
He told me that
I was better than him.

38:07.633 --> 38:08.634
And he was right.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.637
So I'm gonna reclaim that name.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.595
- Hmm.
-And make it stand for good.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.597
Hey, it's like the Doctor said,

38:15.641 --> 38:18.121
"The future is
whatever you want..."

38:18.165 --> 38:19.253
"So make it a good one."

38:19.297 --> 38:21.037
Nice, "Doc" Brown.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.038
Thank you.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.431
All right, guys.

38:25.781 --> 38:26.652
That's my ride.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.350
Oh, hey. Hey.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.309
I know that
you can't do anything
about Lena right now,

38:31.352 --> 38:34.007
but just give it time.

38:34.050 --> 38:37.837
And with William,
you don't have to start
a relationship with a lie.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.449
Just see where it goes.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.668
One step at a time.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.063
Yeah.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.021
I'll miss you.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.285
Okay. That's enough.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.351
Hello, Kara.

39:13.873 --> 39:14.743
Hello.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.355
So, uh, I was thinking,

39:17.398 --> 39:19.182
-um--
-Just one second.
I'm sorry.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.752
It's for your Gran Gran.

39:25.537 --> 39:26.712
The one who was sick.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.540
Oh, right.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.673
My grandma.

39:31.717 --> 39:33.936
My grandmother swears
a good puzzle is better
than antibiotics.

39:34.850 --> 39:35.721
So.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.418
You were saying?

39:38.463 --> 39:39.942
Yeah. Uh...

39:41.291 --> 39:42.641
I was thinking...

39:44.904 --> 39:48.386
I'm sorry, William,
I just don't feel
that way about you.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.476
Ah...

39:52.868 --> 39:54.087
I understand.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.917
I'm sorry for misreading
the situation.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.440
No, no, it's fine.

39:59.484 --> 40:00.528
I'll see you later.

40:01.137 --> 40:01.964
Yeah.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.062
There.

40:14.586 --> 40:17.066
Toyman's immortality code.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.894
I was able to pull
the relevant sections

40:18.938 --> 40:22.768
while everyone else
was distracted.

40:22.811 --> 40:27.076
You are
a very useful employee,
Agent Dox.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.385
Also, I should add
Director Danvers no longer
poses a threat to you

40:31.429 --> 40:32.995
or our operation.

40:33.518 --> 40:34.823
Perfect.

40:34.867 --> 40:38.348
Especially as I just received
her resignation.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.961
So, it would seem
congratulations are in order.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.050
Congratulations.

40:45.573 --> 40:46.922
To you...

40:46.966 --> 40:48.924
DEO Director Dox.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.365
So, how did it go?

40:55.409 --> 40:58.151
He asked about
my sick grandmother.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.501
-And I had to go with it.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.069
It was the first thing
out of my mouth,
and it was a lie.

41:03.112 --> 41:05.811
And then I just... left.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.684
I can battle
Kryptonite-powered Lexosuits,

41:09.728 --> 41:11.773
but I can't even take
the first step
in a relationship

41:11.817 --> 41:14.428
because it is doomed
with deception.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.777
You don't know that for sure.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.301
Well, it happened
with my friendship with Lena.

41:18.345 --> 41:20.608
And I can't help
thinking that...

41:20.652 --> 41:22.480
if I had done
things differently,

41:22.523 --> 41:24.743
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

41:24.786 --> 41:26.658
There is just...
There's no way of knowing.

41:29.182 --> 41:32.011
Oh, that probably
J'onn with the pizza,

41:32.054 --> 41:33.708
which is great.

41:33.752 --> 41:34.709
Hi!

41:36.798 --> 41:38.757
Some say
there's no way of knowing.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.674
But I say, first,
ask Mr. Mxyzptlk.
