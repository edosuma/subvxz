<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

00:02.050 --> 00:03.381
<i>What about us?</i>

00:03.543 --> 00:05.591
You know enough about this place

00:06.356 --> 00:07.408
<i>to get us out.</i>

00:07.558 --> 00:09.281
<i>We make it to the Stargate,</i>

00:09.513 --> 00:11.071
<i>we both go our separate ways.</i>

00:11.495 --> 00:14.225
<i>Until then,
we're going to need each other.</i>

00:14.721 --> 00:16.143
Next time we meet...

00:16.401 --> 00:17.687
All bets are off.

00:17.849 --> 00:20.565
<i>It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.</i>

00:20.726 --> 00:23.734
I've written a basic block
storage transport protocol to upload

00:23.896 --> 00:26.722
<i>the attack command directly
from this tablet into the core.</i>

00:26.845 --> 00:29.033
<i>Long-range scanners have detected
a fleet of ships</i>

00:29.156 --> 00:30.908
<i>being launched
from the replicator planet.</i>

00:31.028 --> 00:32.816
The attack command
must have been activated.

00:32.947 --> 00:35.705
- But they're not heading for us.
- That's a wraith planet.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.248
We really should be going.

00:37.410 --> 00:38.875
You're gonna love the Athosians.

00:39.453 --> 00:40.752
Where is everyone?

00:41.627 --> 00:42.628
I do not know.

00:43.008 --> 00:44.630
What happened to my people?

00:45.208 --> 00:47.800
Teyla, I've looked over
your test results.

00:48.188 --> 00:50.033
There's something we need to talk about.

00:52.275 --> 00:53.639
<i>They are called the Vadeenans.</i>

00:54.031 --> 00:56.866
I've known about them my entire life,
but I've never met them.

00:57.045 --> 00:59.561
They do occasionally
trade with others in the galaxy, but

00:59.723 --> 01:01.490
for the most part,
they keep to themselves.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.149
And you wanna visit them because...

01:03.531 --> 01:05.084
It is said that their leader,

01:05.208 --> 01:07.445
a man named Davos, is a great seer.

01:08.438 --> 01:09.822
You mean, like a psychic?

01:10.655 --> 01:12.618
I do not know
the full extent of his powers,

01:12.755 --> 01:14.465
but it is rumored that he can

01:14.615 --> 01:15.953
even glimpse the future.

01:16.665 --> 01:17.830
Oh, give me a break.

01:18.502 --> 01:20.291
You do not believe
such a thing is possible.

01:20.844 --> 01:22.135
Well, gee, let me think,

01:22.641 --> 01:23.461
no.

01:24.135 --> 01:27.173
<i>Look, in a mechanical,
newtonian universe,</i>

01:27.335 --> 01:30.077
not a problem. You know enough
variables, you can predict the outcome,

01:30.213 --> 01:32.428
but quantum physics blows
that out of the water.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.232
I understand your skepticism.

01:34.368 --> 01:37.717
Even among my own people
the stories were not widely believed,

01:38.591 --> 01:40.561
but I need to know for myself.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.981
You think he might be able to help you
find out what happened to your people?

01:45.406 --> 01:48.566
I realize that
it may seem desperate, but

01:48.731 --> 01:49.987
<i>it has been several weeks,</i>

01:50.155 --> 01:53.032
and our usual means of investigation
have turned up nothing.

01:54.094 --> 01:57.245
Rodney, what's the latest
from the forensics team on New Athos?

01:58.344 --> 02:00.302
Well, they're...
they're still searching,

02:00.458 --> 02:02.333
but so far,
they haven't found anything useful.

02:02.727 --> 02:04.543
<i>Intel hasn't turned up anything either.</i>

02:04.705 --> 02:06.089
As far as we know, they...

02:06.216 --> 02:07.689
vanished into thin air.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.445
Allow me to make a prediction...

02:17.582 --> 02:19.551
this will be a complete waste of time.

02:19.674 --> 02:21.847
Well, I knew you were going to say that.

02:22.011 --> 02:26.017
All right, from what Teyla says,
these people sound a little skittish...

02:26.700 --> 02:29.689
You can bet that four heavily armed
strangers showing up out of nowhere

02:29.809 --> 02:31.730
is gonna set them off a little, so...

02:32.705 --> 02:35.384
let's be on our best behavior, children.

02:51.153 --> 02:53.410
These people don't look very surprised.

02:53.558 --> 02:55.123
You didn't tell them we were coming?

02:55.279 --> 02:57.556
I've had no previous contact
with these people.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.936
My name is Linara.

02:59.073 --> 03:00.891
Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard.

03:01.273 --> 03:03.144

04:12.464 --> 04:13.858
<i>Mr. Woolsey...</i>

04:14.149 --> 04:15.389
how was your trip?

04:15.543 --> 04:18.053
Well, spending a day in quarantine
on the Midway station

04:18.173 --> 04:20.312
wasn't exactly my idea of a good time,

04:20.447 --> 04:23.045
but I suppose it beats a three-week
journey on the Daedalus.

04:23.253 --> 04:26.328
Well, that quarantine was only set up
at the insistence of the IOA.

04:26.465 --> 04:30.351
In response to some recent contagions
that have taken hold on this base.

04:30.669 --> 04:33.860
Let's face it, Midway is the only buffer
between Pegasus and the Milky Way.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.074
It can't hurt to err
on the side of caution.

04:36.472 --> 04:40.014
Anyway, it gave me a chance to prepare
for your three-month evaluation.

04:40.178 --> 04:41.238
Right.

04:41.568 --> 04:44.172
So, how am I doing so far?

04:44.766 --> 04:46.661
That's exactly
what needs to be determined,

04:46.781 --> 04:48.541
but I'm here as an observer only.

04:48.677 --> 04:52.109
I have no intention of getting involved
in the day-day operations of the base.

04:52.302 --> 04:53.360
Really?

04:54.147 --> 04:55.432
That's refreshing.

04:55.588 --> 04:59.382
Well, the IOA has come to realize that
bureaucratic interference on Atlantis

04:59.502 --> 05:02.244
isn't always as beneficial
as we might like to hope,

05:02.859 --> 05:03.859
and,

05:03.987 --> 05:05.636
on a personal note,

05:05.888 --> 05:08.904
it's been brought to my attention
in my own performance evaluations

05:09.024 --> 05:12.773
that I can, on occasion,
be a bit of a busybody.

05:15.206 --> 05:16.796
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

05:16.944 --> 05:18.172
Excuse me.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.422
<i>We're receiving a signal.</i>

05:24.986 --> 05:27.576
It's Captain Robbins, on M2R-441.

05:28.301 --> 05:31.423
They're delivering medical supplies
to a planet that was recently culled.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.715
Patch him in.

05:35.817 --> 05:38.591
Captain, this is Colonel Carter.
Please report.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.913
<i>We had a bit
of a development here, Colonel.</i>

05:41.597 --> 05:43.829
<i>According to the locals,
a few days after the culling,</i>

05:43.949 --> 05:45.514
<i>another hive showed up.</i>

05:45.676 --> 05:46.900
<i>They didn't kill anybody.</i>

05:47.020 --> 05:49.310
<i>They wanted the surviving villagers
to deliver a message.</i>

05:49.734 --> 05:51.651
- A message?
- <i>That's right.</i>

05:51.800 --> 05:54.773
<i>Apparently, this particular Wraith
wants to meet with Colonel Sheppard.</i>

06:00.547 --> 06:03.349
<i>So, you're telling me
Davos knew we were coming?</i>

06:03.663 --> 06:05.117
<i>He had a vision of your arrival.</i>

06:06.098 --> 06:08.649
Before I take you to see him,
there is something you should know.

06:08.795 --> 06:10.549
He's very ill.

06:10.924 --> 06:13.926
Our healers have done all that they can,
but it's not enough.

06:14.423 --> 06:16.025
Some of us were hoping well,

06:16.164 --> 06:18.073
if you do come from
the city of the Ancestors...

06:18.209 --> 06:19.920
We may be able to help.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.842
We would be forever in your debt.

06:23.048 --> 06:24.933
He must be very important to you.

06:25.108 --> 06:26.764
We owe him our lives.

06:27.107 --> 06:29.781
Two years ago, he had a vision
that the Wraith were coming.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.484
We had time to gather our provisions

06:31.604 --> 06:33.840
and escape to the caves
in the northern mountains.

06:33.963 --> 06:37.507
Even from deep underground, we could
hear their ships searching for us.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.951
Eventually, they went away
and never returned.

06:41.483 --> 06:43.672
Not a single Vadeenan was taken.

06:44.381 --> 06:45.666
Impressive.

06:46.103 --> 06:48.833
Of course for me,
it's much more than that.

06:50.049 --> 06:51.402
He's my father.

06:56.308 --> 06:57.456
Father?

06:57.606 --> 06:59.790
The people of Atlantis
are here to see you.

06:59.943 --> 07:00.943
Yes.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.144
Yes, come in.

07:03.308 --> 07:04.885
I've been expecting you,

07:05.254 --> 07:07.221
and I know why you're here.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.103
You have doubt in your heart.

07:16.371 --> 07:19.108
Anyone with a basic understanding
of body language could've told that.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.027
<i>Among my gifts</i>

07:22.370 --> 07:23.997
is the ability to show others

07:24.133 --> 07:25.698
what I can see.

07:29.269 --> 07:31.004
Well, you're the skeptic.

07:32.589 --> 07:33.691
Fine.

07:56.812 --> 07:57.927
What happened?

07:58.758 --> 08:00.454
I... I think I saw a vision.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.293
- Of what?
- Of us.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.019
Being captured by the Wraith.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.140
You said it was a forested planet,
misty, with ancient ruins.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.872
That's what I saw, yes.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.387
<i>What?</i>

08:18.886 --> 08:20.702
While you were gone,
we received a report

08:20.822 --> 08:24.119
that the people of M2R-441
were recently visited by a Wraith.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.258
From the description
of his facial markings,

08:26.378 --> 08:29.467
it sounds like the Wraith who helped
you escape from the Genii last year.

08:30.459 --> 08:31.571
My old buddy?

08:32.339 --> 08:34.215
Apparently, he has
a matter of great importance

08:34.335 --> 08:35.808
that he wants to discuss with you.

08:36.419 --> 08:38.323
<i>We already sent an advance team
to the address</i>

08:38.443 --> 08:40.174
<i>that he proposed for the rendezvous.</i>

08:40.462 --> 08:42.813
The interesting thing is,
it sounds an awful lot like

08:42.933 --> 08:44.704
the planet in McKay's vision.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.999
So we're believing this now?

08:47.329 --> 08:50.278
- Davos did know we were coming.
- Did you ask him about the Athosians?

08:50.398 --> 08:51.650
<i>I did not have a chance.</i>

08:52.023 --> 08:53.976
After he showed Rodney
the vision, he fell ill.

08:54.488 --> 08:56.173
They were hoping we could help him out.

08:56.293 --> 08:58.814
- I'll send Dr. Keller.
- In the meantime, there's only one way

08:58.934 --> 09:01.820
to know for sure if he's right.
Go to the rendezvous, check it out.

09:06.374 --> 09:08.341
Do you have something
to add, Mr. Woolsey?

09:08.683 --> 09:11.761
Well, as I said before,
I'm here strictly as an observer.

09:12.742 --> 09:15.474
But since you ask, I have to wonder
how wise it would be.

09:15.885 --> 09:18.218
<i>I may share some of
Dr. McKay's skepticism, but</i>

09:18.674 --> 09:20.622
we don't need
any mystical visions to tell us

09:20.742 --> 09:23.274
that this Wraith
probably can't be trusted.

09:23.727 --> 09:26.190
You're talking about walking
deliberately into a trap.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.487
Exactly.

09:38.257 --> 09:39.424
This is a bad idea.

09:39.618 --> 09:41.912
You're the one who said
it's impossible to see the future.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.805
<i>Yeah, I was thinking about that.
I've realized that quantum uncertainty</i>

09:44.925 --> 09:48.340
<i>doesn't necessarily preclude the
possibility of seeing probable futures.</i>

09:49.181 --> 09:50.483
It's like blackjack.

09:50.603 --> 09:52.763
You never know exactly
what's going to happen next, but

09:52.883 --> 09:55.889
a card counter can certainly
increase the odds in his favor,

09:56.009 --> 09:57.933
and frankly,
this feels like hitting on an 18.

09:58.411 --> 10:00.709
It's more like
doubling down against a 10.

10:08.337 --> 10:11.029
Hold on, this is the place.
This is where it happened.

10:21.686 --> 10:23.881
You were supposed to come unarmed.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.002
Yeah.

10:26.862 --> 10:28.157
Sorry about that.

10:38.998 --> 10:40.250
How's the patient, Doctor?

10:40.538 --> 10:42.580
Well, from what I can tell, he...

10:43.610 --> 10:45.524
he seems to be suffering from...

10:46.373 --> 10:48.358
a kind of lymphatic cancer.

10:49.151 --> 10:51.412
<i>There's not a lot I can do for him here.</i>

10:51.672 --> 10:55.630
Have you detected any physical anomalies
that might be related to his visions?

10:57.319 --> 10:58.796
Sorry. Force of habit.

10:59.496 --> 11:01.580
<i>Well, I don't really have the equipment</i>

11:01.742 --> 11:04.124
with me that's necessary
to make that kind of analysis.

11:04.382 --> 11:06.895
- Why don't you bring him back?
- <i>Understood.</i>

11:07.831 --> 11:09.462
<i>Just so we're clear,</i>

11:09.673 --> 11:11.515
are we doing this to

11:11.742 --> 11:13.443
try and save his life or

11:14.223 --> 11:15.299
to study him?

11:19.397 --> 11:22.351
I'll have the infirmary prepped
and ready for your arrival.

11:23.055 --> 11:24.076
Carter out.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.279
- So much for trust.
- You tried to ambush us.

11:43.399 --> 11:45.540
<i>I had no intention of causing you harm,</i>

11:46.023 --> 11:48.668
but I could not guarantee your
cooperation simply by

11:49.079 --> 11:51.275
<i>throwing myself at your mercy.</i>

11:51.463 --> 11:54.799
My intent was to have
this discussion on neutral ground.

11:55.151 --> 11:56.355
What discussion?

11:56.475 --> 11:58.970
The reason for my contacting you.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.932
I require your help.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.593
We worked together once before.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.276
- Doesn't mean I want to do it again.
- <i>You will.</i>

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
Oh, more predictions, just what I need.

12:11.793 --> 12:13.890
As you know, Wraith are at war.

12:14.156 --> 12:17.739
I believe you refer to our enemy
as the Replicators.

12:18.508 --> 12:21.348
- Sounds vaguely familiar.
- Well, we have a weapon,

12:22.292 --> 12:25.696
a virus that was designed
to reset their attack directive,

12:25.816 --> 12:29.003
causing them to stand down
and return to their planet.

12:29.401 --> 12:31.100
At present, it is not working.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.010
<i>Get to the part where we care.</i>

12:33.130 --> 12:34.703
It is well known among the Wraith

12:34.823 --> 12:38.093
that Dr. McKay made certain changes
to the replicator base code,

12:38.641 --> 12:41.179
opening the door for them
to alter their own programming.

12:41.921 --> 12:43.418
Well, knowingly or not,

12:43.538 --> 12:46.894
they have since repaired
the weakness our virus exploited,

12:47.132 --> 12:49.342
<i>which means
in order to get it working again,</i>

12:50.039 --> 12:52.514
I need to know the changes
Dr. McKay made.

12:52.634 --> 12:54.567
Now, here's the part you're not getting.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.377
We're glad they're kicking your ass.

12:57.652 --> 13:01.402
Only because you are as yet
unaware of their new tactic.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.162
What are you talking about?

13:03.287 --> 13:06.854
They realized we have
a significant vulnerability...

13:08.065 --> 13:09.707
our food supply.

13:12.924 --> 13:16.381
They have begun to annihilate
human worlds.

13:21.326 --> 13:23.881
- You think he's telling the truth?
- He gave us an address.

13:24.006 --> 13:26.683
Claims it was a human planet
the Replicators destroyed.

13:27.069 --> 13:29.186
- Is it in the database?
- M5S-768.

13:29.347 --> 13:30.755
We visited it last year.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.814
It was a thriving,
pre-industrial society.

13:33.237 --> 13:35.066
- Send a malp.
- Okay.

13:45.879 --> 13:47.597
Receiving malp telemetry.

13:48.318 --> 13:49.414
Here we go.

13:52.318 --> 13:53.456
No life signs.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.796
How do we know
the Wraith didn't do that?

13:56.942 --> 13:59.077
The malp's detecting residual radiation.

13:59.197 --> 14:01.910
The energy signature's consistent
with replicator weapons fire.

14:02.793 --> 14:04.137
He was telling the truth.

14:05.180 --> 14:06.890
How many people lived on that planet?

14:07.632 --> 14:09.184
<i>We estimated somewhere between...</i>

14:09.551 --> 14:11.019
50,000 and 75,000.

14:19.968 --> 14:21.590
What does the machine do?

14:22.423 --> 14:25.867
It scans the cells in his body
and reports any abnormalities.

14:27.376 --> 14:30.274
Hopefully, it'll help us figure out
exactly what's wrong with him.

14:31.139 --> 14:33.208
And then you'll be able to cure him?

14:34.952 --> 14:36.218
I'll do my best.

14:37.248 --> 14:38.824
You'll have to forgive her, Doctor.

14:39.117 --> 14:41.765
She's not used to dealing
with uncertainty.

14:41.885 --> 14:44.467
I may have spoiled her in that regard.

14:45.069 --> 14:47.216
Yeah, I heard about your gift.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.516
It's remarkable.

14:50.079 --> 14:51.569
I can see many things,

14:53.045 --> 14:56.272
but unfortunately, my own fate
remains hidden from me.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.406
If we hadn't reactivated the attack-code
this never would have happened.

15:03.526 --> 15:04.800
It was my call, Rodney.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.218
<i>But it was my idea.</i>

15:06.550 --> 15:08.146
Now, we had a ZPM, we had Elizabeth,

15:08.266 --> 15:10.458
all we had to do was leave,
but I opened my big mouth.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.781
You never could have known
it was going to go this way.

15:12.901 --> 15:14.448
No, we don't know that for sure.

15:15.009 --> 15:18.220
Remember the nanovirus
that caused the fatal aneurysms?

15:18.352 --> 15:20.328
I always suspected
the Replicators were behind it.

15:20.448 --> 15:21.638
But you never proved it.

15:21.758 --> 15:24.851
But we know how they feel about the
humans. They think we were a mistake.

15:24.971 --> 15:26.982
We should have seen
something like this coming.

15:29.544 --> 15:31.280
I know this news
is hard for us to accept,

15:31.400 --> 15:34.232
but right now we need to focus,
figure out what our next step is.

15:34.352 --> 15:36.642
I suppose the most obvious solution
would be to shut down

15:36.762 --> 15:38.829
- the attack code again.
- Can we do that?

15:38.949 --> 15:40.692
It's been done before, just not by us.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.443
- By the Wraith.
- Yes.

15:42.677 --> 15:45.176
And what about our prisoner?
What exactly is he proposing?

15:45.296 --> 15:48.818
He claims to have the original virus
that de-activated the code the 1st time.

15:48.938 --> 15:50.376
It's not working this time round

15:50.496 --> 15:53.079
because of the changes we made
to the replicator base code.

15:53.398 --> 15:56.250
Theoretically, knowing what we know,
and knowing what they know, we...

15:56.377 --> 15:58.710
should be able to work together
to shut them down again.

15:58.963 --> 16:00.990
Obviously, that's out of the question.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.776
Do I have to remind everyone
what happened

16:04.896 --> 16:06.696
the last time
we cooperated with the Wraith?

16:06.841 --> 16:09.922
The circumstances have changed,
and what happened to non-interference?

16:10.042 --> 16:12.497
As you said,
the circumstances have changed.

16:13.361 --> 16:16.191
Col. Sheppard, you've had the most
experience dealing with the Wraith.

16:16.311 --> 16:18.628
Do you seriously think
this is a good idea?

16:19.074 --> 16:21.065
I think it's not your call.

16:22.771 --> 16:24.360
I need to contact my superiors.

16:37.420 --> 16:40.142
It's just been confirmed.
Two more worlds have been destroyed.

16:40.262 --> 16:41.511
That makes three.

16:42.874 --> 16:43.984
How many dead?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.914
Well, it's just an estimate...

16:46.125 --> 16:47.125
How many?

16:47.679 --> 16:48.964
150,000.

16:50.686 --> 16:52.563
And this is just the beginning,
isn't it?

16:52.687 --> 16:54.691
<i>There's no reason
to assume they're going to stop.</i>

16:54.811 --> 16:55.628
No.

16:56.726 --> 16:58.084
What about Woolsey?

16:58.560 --> 17:01.877
He's contacted the IOA. They're taking
the matter under advisement.

17:01.997 --> 17:04.236
Oh, well, they're good at that.

17:04.571 --> 17:06.710
They'll bicker and argue,
but in the end of the day,

17:06.829 --> 17:10.323
they're going to leave you holding the
bag, just like they did with Elizabeth.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.633
Now, I know why you didn't want the job.

17:12.752 --> 17:14.943
Look, John,
Woolsey was right about one thing.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.401
You have had more experience
with the Wraith than just about anyone,

17:18.936 --> 17:21.569
and in particular, with this Wraith.
You have a history.

17:21.824 --> 17:23.294
Well, it's not like we're dating.

17:24.561 --> 17:26.958
I know we can't trust him,
not completely,

17:27.323 --> 17:29.641
but what I don't know is
whether or not it's worth the risk

17:29.761 --> 17:32.328
to play along with him,
at least for a little while.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.671
You're the only one who can answer that.

17:36.492 --> 17:38.501
<i>Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.</i>

17:38.936 --> 17:39.936
Go ahead.

17:40.372 --> 17:42.247
<i>I've got something you need to see.</i>

17:42.873 --> 17:44.178
I'm on my way.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.578
How's he doing?

17:51.402 --> 17:52.452
Not good.

17:53.952 --> 17:56.070
He went into convulsions a while ago.

17:56.255 --> 17:57.648
I gave him a sedative.

17:58.825 --> 18:00.532
Truth is, we got him here too late.

18:00.652 --> 18:03.013
All I can do right now
is alleviate his symptoms,

18:03.133 --> 18:05.162
but whether or not he survives...

18:06.077 --> 18:07.615
that's out of my hands.

18:08.563 --> 18:10.349
This is what I wanted you to see.

18:11.595 --> 18:13.704
This is the result of his brain scan.

18:14.864 --> 18:17.250
He's showing abnormally high
synaptic activity.

18:17.370 --> 18:19.173
It's similar to
what happened to Dr. McKay

18:19.293 --> 18:21.697
when he encountered
that ascension device, only

18:21.817 --> 18:23.192
not as extreme,

18:23.794 --> 18:26.212
<i>and in his case, it's not advancing.</i>

18:27.418 --> 18:29.691
Presumably he's been like that
his whole life.

18:30.683 --> 18:32.559
You're saying he was born this way?

18:33.877 --> 18:35.470
He's a genetic accident.

18:35.758 --> 18:37.869
One in a million, if not more.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.917
And by the way,
Mr. Woolsey's already asked

18:43.037 --> 18:45.081
for a copy of these test results.

18:45.527 --> 18:48.900
I'm sorry, Doctor, but like it or not,
this is important information.

18:49.105 --> 18:51.741
He may be a window into
our own evolutionary future.

18:53.357 --> 18:54.262
<i>Doctor?</i>

18:54.723 --> 18:55.793
He's awake.

19:03.328 --> 19:04.685
How're you feeling?

19:05.044 --> 19:06.665
Much better, thank you.

19:08.042 --> 19:09.386
Hi, I'm colonel Carter.

19:10.543 --> 19:12.363
You are the leader of these people.

19:12.483 --> 19:14.547
Well, the ones on this base, yes.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.996
Not an easy task, I imagine.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.344
Some days are worse than others.

19:20.464 --> 19:21.568
I understand.

19:22.546 --> 19:26.887
I myself was on a position of authority
back on my homeworld.

19:27.194 --> 19:29.680
From what I understand,
you had a little bit of an advantage.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.683
Believe me, catching glimpses
of the future is not always as

19:32.813 --> 19:34.524
helpful as you might think.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.216
But there is something you should see.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.276
You're not feeling well. I think...
it's okay. You should rest.

19:43.396 --> 19:45.466
Everything has a purpose, Colonel,

19:46.485 --> 19:49.065
including the circumstances
that brought me here. Please.

20:19.860 --> 20:20.860
Oh, my God.

20:21.128 --> 20:22.725
What is it? What did you see?

20:26.045 --> 20:27.045
I'm sorry.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.358
<i>We should stop trusting that Wraith,</i>

20:32.704 --> 20:34.573
- now.
- I'm not buying it.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.454
Dr. McKay's vision came true
exactly as he saw it.

20:37.574 --> 20:40.481
Well, I don't care. The Replicators
are not destroying this City,

20:40.601 --> 20:42.325
not if I have anything to say about it.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.923
Maybe Rodney's right.

20:44.139 --> 20:46.985
Maybe what Davos can see
is only a probable future.

20:47.201 --> 20:50.457
Well, his track record's pretty good,
so I'd have to say it's highly probable.

20:50.577 --> 20:52.865
<i>Which means
it's going to be hard to avoid.</i>

20:53.388 --> 20:56.799
For all we know, 9 out of 10 courses of
action are gonna lead to the same fate.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.344
<i>Now, unfortunately,
the vision I saw had no context to it.</i>

21:00.755 --> 21:03.324
We have no way of knowing
why the Replicators were attacking.

21:03.461 --> 21:04.474
Isn't it obvious?

21:04.827 --> 21:07.852
We're contemplating joining forces
with the Wraith against them.

21:08.015 --> 21:09.546
We don't know that's what causes it.

21:09.682 --> 21:11.824
It's a pretty safe assumption.
Now we're not a target.

21:11.947 --> 21:12.934
<i>No, no,</i>

21:13.057 --> 21:16.820
but the rest of the humans
in this galaxy are, and it's our fault.

21:17.116 --> 21:18.198
Nevertheless,

21:18.335 --> 21:20.948
our priority remains
the safety of this expedition,

21:21.231 --> 21:22.534
<i>and you know as well as I do</i>

21:22.839 --> 21:24.536
the Wraith can't be trusted.

21:24.971 --> 21:26.371
This one may be different.

21:27.349 --> 21:28.838
Yes, I read the file.

21:29.235 --> 21:30.938
He helped you escape
from a Genii prison,

21:31.058 --> 21:32.980
and as a reward, you let him live.

21:34.382 --> 21:36.923
Let's hope we don't all come to regret

21:37.043 --> 21:38.133
your decision.

21:39.301 --> 21:40.301
Colonel Carter,

21:40.654 --> 21:41.775
<i>we've got a problem.</i>

21:45.232 --> 21:48.054
We routinely track a number of hives
with the long-range sensors.

21:48.177 --> 21:50.268
They don't usually do
anything out of the ordinary.

21:50.405 --> 21:52.482
Most of the time,
they're just passing through,

21:52.840 --> 21:54.524
but a few minutes ago, this one

21:55.300 --> 21:56.913
suddenly changed course.

21:57.757 --> 21:59.237
It's headed straight for us.

21:59.399 --> 22:02.694
- But they don't know we're here.
- They're not supposed to.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.455
What did you do?

22:08.617 --> 22:10.855
- What are you referring to?
- <i>There's a ship on the way.</i>

22:11.005 --> 22:12.625
Ah, they picked up my signal.

22:12.945 --> 22:15.128
- What signal?
- Ask your Satedan friend.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.130
He's familiar with the technology.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.895
A subspace tracking device.

22:19.031 --> 22:20.467
I had it implanted.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.830
We would've detected it.

22:21.970 --> 22:24.746
I only activated it
after you brought me here.

22:24.965 --> 22:27.138
The ship is necessary
to complete my plan.

22:27.317 --> 22:29.650
The replicator virus is contained
within its databanks.

22:29.770 --> 22:32.520
- When it gets here, we may begin.
<i>- Or when it gets here,</i>

22:32.888 --> 22:34.829
I'm gonna blow it out of the sky.

22:36.005 --> 22:37.484
Now, that would be unwise.

22:38.055 --> 22:39.654
That hive is loyal to me.

22:39.818 --> 22:43.152
For the moment, they are the only ones
who know the location of Atlantis,

22:44.314 --> 22:46.159
<i>but if you attack them,</i>

22:46.446 --> 22:48.273
they will broadcast these coordinates

22:48.429 --> 22:51.414
to every hive ship in the galaxy.

22:55.309 --> 22:58.630
There is no reason for us
to be at odds, John Sheppard.

23:00.693 --> 23:02.217
We need each other.

23:07.663 --> 23:10.633
We need to know if you can shut down
the replicator attack code on your own.

23:10.762 --> 23:13.354
I've been looking into that,
and it's not very promising.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.497
You're the one who activated it
in the first place.

23:15.620 --> 23:18.699
That was easy. Actually, spectacularly
difficult, but everything's relative.

23:19.089 --> 23:21.249
The Replicators were originally
designed and programmed

23:21.371 --> 23:22.816
to do exactly what they're doing.

23:22.936 --> 23:24.152
They were built for this.

23:24.275 --> 23:27.283
It was harder for the Wraith to stop
them than for me to start them again.

23:27.671 --> 23:29.494
But with this Wraith's help,
you could do it?

23:29.939 --> 23:32.705
If he really has the original
shut-down virus, yeah, I think we can.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.867
He claims he ordered the hive ship

23:35.987 --> 23:38.378
not to give away our position
unless they're attacked.

23:38.539 --> 23:39.629
Do you believe him?

23:39.791 --> 23:41.877
Well, are there
any other ships headed this way?

23:43.003 --> 23:45.260
Then I'd say for the moment,
he's telling the truth.

23:52.175 --> 23:54.957
Dr. Keller told me
I might find you here.

23:56.501 --> 23:59.107
She was kind enough
to let me go for a little walk.

24:01.426 --> 24:03.148
It's quite something, isn't it?

24:03.285 --> 24:04.296
Yes.

24:05.896 --> 24:08.045
I know I was brought here for a reason,

24:09.384 --> 24:11.978
to play a role on a much bigger stage

24:12.784 --> 24:14.206
before I die.

24:14.823 --> 24:17.500
Surely it is not time
to start speaking that way.

24:19.942 --> 24:22.716
Dr. Keller is a dedicated
and skilled physician,

24:22.866 --> 24:27.078
but it doesn't take a great seer to know
what she is thinking and not saying.

24:28.076 --> 24:30.013
My time is coming to an end.

24:34.175 --> 24:36.183
You wish to ask me something.

24:37.635 --> 24:39.439
You know why I came to your planet?

24:39.726 --> 24:41.190
To learn the fate of your people.

24:42.135 --> 24:42.859
Yes.

24:43.021 --> 24:44.664
I can tell you only this...

24:44.855 --> 24:46.362
they are still alive.

24:48.465 --> 24:50.158
But they are shrouded in darkness.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.786
I know you will continue
to search for them,

24:54.425 --> 24:56.570
but I'm not sure
this burden should be borne

24:56.693 --> 24:58.499
by someone in your condition.

24:59.507 --> 25:00.710
My condition?

25:01.887 --> 25:03.921
You carry a life inside you, do you not?

25:06.627 --> 25:07.759
Yes.

25:09.761 --> 25:11.638
You conceal it from the others.

25:12.073 --> 25:13.692
It is complicated.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.016
I see.

25:15.946 --> 25:17.602
I'm sorry I cannot offer you more.

25:18.448 --> 25:19.610
That is all right.

25:20.266 --> 25:21.272
Thank you.

25:21.523 --> 25:23.149
Now you must take me to colonel Carter.

25:23.532 --> 25:24.776
Yes, of course.

25:25.049 --> 25:26.101
This way.

25:36.216 --> 25:39.245
This is Teyla to the infirmary.
I need a medical team now!

25:42.234 --> 25:44.137
- We got a problem.
- Firing drones.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.113
Teyla's vision only confirms
what I've been saying all along.

26:00.246 --> 26:03.612
If we destroy the hive ship, we lose our
best chance of stopping the Replicators.

26:03.735 --> 26:04.978
We may not have a choice.

26:05.115 --> 26:08.736
One way or another, events are going to
result in the destruction of that ship.

26:08.898 --> 26:11.621
If you believe that, then you believe
Atlantis is gonna be destroyed.

26:11.757 --> 26:14.117
We might as well
pack up our bags and go home.

26:16.263 --> 26:17.328
<i>How about this.</i>

26:17.490 --> 26:19.608
We play along.
We wait for them to transmit

26:19.728 --> 26:21.355
the program to Rodney's computer,

26:21.519 --> 26:23.567
then we blow 'em out of the sky.

26:23.704 --> 26:25.712
Betray them before they have
a chance to betray us.

26:26.451 --> 26:29.007
They're Wraith.
Anyone gonna lose any sleep over this?

26:30.319 --> 26:33.845
Can you guarantee you could finish
the job without the Wraith's help?

26:34.257 --> 26:36.055
If I have the original virus,
not a problem.

26:36.457 --> 26:39.013
- Can you guarantee it?
- Well, I mean...

26:40.630 --> 26:41.352
no.

26:41.827 --> 26:43.438
<i>That is not the only problem.</i>

26:43.600 --> 26:45.430
If we do not destroy
the hive quickly enough,

26:45.567 --> 26:47.233
it may have time to send a message.

26:48.134 --> 26:51.058
All right. I think I need
to meet this Wraith myself.

26:51.742 --> 26:52.959
Mr. Woolsey...

26:54.888 --> 26:56.366
You want me to come with you?

26:56.529 --> 26:59.328
I'm sure you want your report to
the IOA to be as thorough as possible.

27:01.877 --> 27:03.148
Of course.

27:10.050 --> 27:12.225
I've never met a Wraith
face-to-face before.

27:12.362 --> 27:13.865
Well, you're in for a treat.

27:20.075 --> 27:21.456
Ladies first.

27:23.629 --> 27:25.181
- Open it.
- Colonel...

27:25.331 --> 27:26.875
It's all right.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.850
I'm colonel Samantha Carter.

27:31.021 --> 27:33.461
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

27:34.951 --> 27:36.358
Richard Woolsey.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.660
I understand you're proposing that
we work together on a joint venture.

27:39.937 --> 27:42.538
- That is correct.
- Last time we went down this road,

27:42.700 --> 27:44.777
things didn't exactly work out
the way we'd hoped.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.960
You were betrayed. Believe me,
I understand your reluctance.

27:49.187 --> 27:51.052
If we do this, we do it our way.

27:51.243 --> 27:52.604
Your ship remains in orbit.

27:52.727 --> 27:55.367
They make the slightest false move,
and they'll be destroyed.

27:55.565 --> 27:57.924
- Fair enough.
- The program will be downloaded

27:58.061 --> 28:00.306
into a non-networked computer
in one of our labs.

28:00.468 --> 28:02.266
All work will be conducted on this base.

28:02.428 --> 28:06.479
You will remain under constant guard,
and when you're done, we keep the virus.

28:06.954 --> 28:09.401
It won't be easy to upload it
into the replicator network.

28:09.530 --> 28:11.067
Are you sure you're up to the task?

28:11.424 --> 28:13.361
We did it before, we'll do it again.

28:19.027 --> 28:20.449
I agree to your terms.

28:20.749 --> 28:22.870
You see, I want this as much as you do.

28:23.347 --> 28:26.374
Now, let's say that this works.
What happens then?

28:27.131 --> 28:29.190
In my time
as a prisoner among the Genii,

28:29.310 --> 28:31.122
I lost my position among Wraith.

28:31.259 --> 28:32.798
I still have a few loyal followers,

28:32.918 --> 28:35.045
but nothing like
the standing I once had.

28:35.168 --> 28:38.803
So you're going to use this
to leverage your way back in?

28:39.167 --> 28:40.513
In a manner of speaking.

28:40.794 --> 28:43.343
Sooner or later, we're going
to end up on opposite sides.

28:43.466 --> 28:44.183
Yes,

28:44.806 --> 28:46.250
but not today.

28:46.687 --> 28:48.020
Do we have an agreement?

28:51.580 --> 28:52.742
We do.

28:53.088 --> 28:55.444
I believe among your people,
it is customary to shake hands.

29:02.095 --> 29:03.369
Just a little wraith humor.

29:04.722 --> 29:06.431
I hope you know what you're doing.

29:20.806 --> 29:22.680
<i>The wraith ship
just dropped out of hyperspace.</i>

29:23.005 --> 29:24.946
Are they powering weapons?

29:26.860 --> 29:29.149
Negative.
They're sending a transmission.

29:29.422 --> 29:30.803
Rodney, you're on.

29:31.810 --> 29:33.936
<i>That's it? That's their super-weapon?</i>

29:34.060 --> 29:35.816
Well, what were you expecting?

29:36.121 --> 29:37.360
A big gun?

29:37.714 --> 29:39.299
Something that goes boom?

29:41.772 --> 29:42.783
Sam, that's it.

29:43.686 --> 29:44.834
<i>We got it.</i>

29:45.094 --> 29:47.869
I can go down to the chair room,
finish this off right now.

29:48.057 --> 29:49.484
I can't risk it, John.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.627
Security, have the Wraith
escorted to Dr. Mckay's lab.

29:56.245 --> 29:58.165
No, this is all wrong.

29:58.888 --> 30:00.841
- What do you mean?
- You must iterate all values

30:00.964 --> 30:03.150
of the expression before
you can aggregate the results.

30:03.287 --> 30:06.105
You kidding? We're better off using
known data points and extrapolating.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.047
You risk compounding errors.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.227
What?

30:10.122 --> 30:13.500
If my hands were free, I could help you.

30:13.623 --> 30:15.936
No, it's fine.
I'll do it myself, thanks.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.695
As you wish.

30:25.541 --> 30:26.702
<i>He's holding out on us.</i>

30:27.441 --> 30:28.985
Part of the virus is missing.

30:29.122 --> 30:31.294
Sure, they're minor sub-routines,
not greatly affected

30:31.417 --> 30:33.417
by the changes I made
to the base code, but still,

30:33.560 --> 30:34.810
necessary to make it work.

30:34.956 --> 30:36.977
I probably wouldn't have
even noticed it, except...

30:37.097 --> 30:38.923
well, you know, I'm really good.

30:39.085 --> 30:41.717
- Look, he's definitely up to something.
- We know.

30:42.682 --> 30:45.012
You know? What do you mean you know?

30:45.241 --> 30:47.988
A few minutes ago,
we started tracking another hive ship

30:48.108 --> 30:49.684
on course for Atlantis.

30:53.474 --> 30:55.726
I swear I know nothing of this.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.817
You gave our position away
to another hive ship.

30:58.979 --> 31:00.542
Why would I betray you now,

31:00.665 --> 31:02.937
just as we were beginning
to trust each other?

31:03.086 --> 31:04.448
<i>We're not, really, are we?</i>

31:05.247 --> 31:06.784
You held back some of the virus.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.623
Just a small portion.

31:13.398 --> 31:15.376
Nothing that prevents us
from completing our work,

31:15.538 --> 31:18.374
and once that is done,
I will gladly transmit the remainder.

31:18.541 --> 31:20.589
- I say we kill him right now.
- I agree.

31:22.499 --> 31:25.128
I had no way of knowing
you would not simply...

31:25.425 --> 31:27.986
take the virus and then turn against me.

31:28.175 --> 31:29.807
I'm offended you could even think that.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.776
The point is, you lied. How do we know
you're not lying about the ship?

31:33.899 --> 31:36.807
Wraith are divided into many camps.

31:36.939 --> 31:39.984
There is much suspicion and mistrust.

31:40.563 --> 31:43.599
The last thing I need
is for another hive to appear

31:43.719 --> 31:45.740
before I can complete this work.

31:45.939 --> 31:47.123
That's it.

31:47.410 --> 31:50.619
That's why they're coming. They're
tracking his ship. Think about it,

31:50.812 --> 31:53.135
a single hive, off by itself,
out in the middle of nowhere,

31:53.258 --> 31:55.485
orbiting a supposedly
uninhabited planet.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.412
That's bound to raise a few eyebrows.

31:57.755 --> 31:59.503
I mean, if you had eyebrows.

32:01.225 --> 32:03.316
There is only one solution.

32:05.803 --> 32:07.935
You must cloak the City.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.236
We cloak the City, we lose shields.

32:16.356 --> 32:18.010
We'd be completely vulnerable to attack.

32:18.147 --> 32:19.650
And what if he's telling the truth?

32:19.773 --> 32:21.864
If we don't cloak, we'll
be giving up our position.

32:22.028 --> 32:25.092
He's been playing us from the start.
This is what he wanted all along.

32:25.215 --> 32:26.432
All right, wait a minute.

32:26.568 --> 32:29.042
You thought the Replicators
were going to destroy the City.

32:29.165 --> 32:31.693
Now you think the Wraith
are gonna do it? Which one is it?

32:33.320 --> 32:35.039
How long until
the second hive gets here?

32:35.390 --> 32:36.469
Two hours.

32:40.945 --> 32:41.962
<i>Hello again.</i>

32:42.442 --> 32:43.442
Colonel.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.000
It's nice to see you,
but I'm afraid I can't offer you

32:46.120 --> 32:48.219
any more insight into future events.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.013
These medicines dull my mind.

32:51.709 --> 32:53.636
That's all right. That's not why I came,

32:54.142 --> 32:56.518
I did want to ask you
a few questions about your visions,

32:56.641 --> 32:59.313
- if you feel up to it.
- Of course.

33:00.550 --> 33:02.233
Have you ever been wrong?

33:02.573 --> 33:03.584
No.

33:03.735 --> 33:05.403
Knowing how events play out,

33:05.990 --> 33:09.073
you haven't been able to change
the future, or... or avoid it?

33:10.651 --> 33:11.826
I'm afraid not.

33:12.255 --> 33:14.087
What about the culling on your planet?

33:14.287 --> 33:15.663
I did not see a culling,

33:16.189 --> 33:18.182
merely the wraith ships arriving,

33:18.302 --> 33:20.378
and that is exactly what happened.

33:21.850 --> 33:24.527
Dr. McKay's vision
happened as he saw it,

33:25.316 --> 33:27.591
but his interpretation was incorrect.

33:29.069 --> 33:30.970
Pretty hard to misinterpret what I saw.

33:31.424 --> 33:33.013
<i>I make no judgments,</i>

33:33.588 --> 33:35.766
but I do know it will come to pass.

33:36.945 --> 33:38.936
It's hard for me to accept that.

33:39.098 --> 33:41.144
You're telling me that
the future is predetermined,

33:41.264 --> 33:44.462
but I have always believed that
the future is what you make it.

33:45.819 --> 33:47.153
Perhaps both are true.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.475
Perhaps the future is predetermined

33:49.595 --> 33:51.866
by the character of those who shape it.

33:53.696 --> 33:54.811
One thing

33:54.934 --> 33:58.004
has been clear to me
from the moment I set foot in this City.

34:00.069 --> 34:02.174
The galaxy is at a crossroads.

34:03.197 --> 34:04.628
Never before

34:05.002 --> 34:07.298
have I sensed that the future

34:08.391 --> 34:10.050
of so many worlds can turn

34:10.212 --> 34:12.330
on the actions of so few.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.183
The other hive ship will be here soon.

34:29.364 --> 34:30.385
I know.

34:30.774 --> 34:34.637
- You should get down to the chair room.
- So we've decided to take 'em out?

34:35.129 --> 34:37.617
Right now, I'm having
a hard time deciding anything.

34:39.009 --> 34:40.675
You know what the problem is?

34:40.920 --> 34:43.034
- Too much information.
- Really.

34:43.286 --> 34:45.271
Only so much information
to make a decision.

34:45.391 --> 34:47.286
Anything after that complicates it.

34:47.409 --> 34:50.174
Like these visions,
are they making things better or worse?

34:50.760 --> 34:52.610
They helped you avoid being captured.

34:52.759 --> 34:56.096
No, you and I both know we would never
walk into a trap unprepared,

34:56.435 --> 34:58.572
<i>even if McKay didn't have that vision.</i>

34:58.708 --> 35:02.728
The future is predetermined by
the character of those who shape it.

35:03.015 --> 35:04.177
What's that?

35:05.899 --> 35:06.992
Nothing.

35:07.717 --> 35:08.609
Look,

35:09.063 --> 35:11.445
technically Woolsey is correct.

35:12.090 --> 35:15.449
The safety of this City is
our first priority, and based on that,

35:16.197 --> 35:18.042
there is only one decision,

35:18.247 --> 35:20.329
take out both the hive ships
as soon as possible.

35:20.675 --> 35:21.741
But...

35:22.085 --> 35:22.873
But...

35:23.354 --> 35:26.697
what the hell's the point of being
out here if we're not gonna help people?

35:27.037 --> 35:30.130
We're going to be safe and sound while
the rest of the galaxy gets slaughtered?

35:31.119 --> 35:33.109
So, play it safe or
take a chance with the Wraith

35:33.229 --> 35:35.261
and maybe save millions of lives.

35:37.964 --> 35:40.105
This kind of decision used to be easy,

35:40.225 --> 35:42.475
but then I was just making it
for myself.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.753
Now I'm asking a lot of people
to take a chance with me.

35:45.917 --> 35:48.487
Everybody on this base chose to be here,

35:49.778 --> 35:53.153
and they did so because they believe
in the same things you do.

35:55.733 --> 35:56.949
If anything goes wrong...

35:57.544 --> 35:58.733
I'll be ready.

36:15.065 --> 36:17.239
Rodney, prepare to cloak the City.

36:17.379 --> 36:20.088
All right, people, you heard her.
Let's do this.

36:25.090 --> 36:26.290
My understanding...

36:26.591 --> 36:29.556
is it takes some doing to switch back
from the cloak to the shields.

36:29.681 --> 36:31.608
It's not something
that can be done right away.

36:31.745 --> 36:32.824
That's right.

36:32.947 --> 36:35.808
So if we commit to this course
of action, there's no going back.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.656
I'm afraid not.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.529
There's still some time before
the second hive gets here.

36:41.679 --> 36:43.889
You could return to Midway if you like.

36:44.628 --> 36:47.558
But then my report wouldn't be
as thorough as possible,

36:47.695 --> 36:48.709
would it?

36:53.206 --> 36:54.465
I'm in position, Colonel.

36:55.667 --> 36:56.705
Understood.

36:57.546 --> 36:58.783
How we doing?

36:59.111 --> 37:00.573
Engaging cloak...

37:01.749 --> 37:02.723
<i>now.</i>

37:10.291 --> 37:11.330
Father?

37:13.408 --> 37:14.433
Father?

37:14.788 --> 37:17.046
Doctor! Doctor, help him!

37:21.488 --> 37:22.368
Father?

37:27.029 --> 37:28.143
No...

37:29.797 --> 37:30.918
I'm sorry.

37:46.001 --> 37:47.893
Second hive
just dropped out of hyperspace.

37:50.228 --> 37:51.230
This is it.

37:58.202 --> 37:59.905
The first hive
is sending a transmission.

38:00.647 --> 38:02.699
Probably trying to explain
what they're doing here.

38:02.861 --> 38:05.033
- What's happening?
- <i>Stand by.</i>

38:06.673 --> 38:08.372
They're still just talking.

38:10.048 --> 38:12.209
Wait a minute. We got a problem.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.283
What is it? What's going on?

38:15.116 --> 38:16.672
Both ships just powered weapons.

38:17.969 --> 38:19.258
- Oh, my God.
- <i>That's it.</i>

38:19.663 --> 38:21.552
- Firing drones.
- <i>John, wait.</i>

38:23.332 --> 38:24.540
Just give it a second.

38:24.677 --> 38:25.681
<i>Are you insane?</i>

38:25.843 --> 38:27.975
- They're going to wipe us out!
- Shut up, Woolsey.

38:29.184 --> 38:30.185
Colonel Sheppard,

38:30.347 --> 38:31.854
<i>as ranking representant of the IOA,</i>

38:32.016 --> 38:34.106
I'm assuming command of this base.

38:34.772 --> 38:36.570
I'm ordering you
to launch the drones now!

38:36.693 --> 38:37.693
<i>Belay that order!</i>

38:37.855 --> 38:40.758
One more word out of you,
and I will have you removed.

38:43.684 --> 38:45.534
Hold on, something's happening.

38:45.870 --> 38:47.956
- The hives are firing on each other.
- Are you sure?

38:48.079 --> 38:50.330
Definitely. They're not
pulling any punches, either.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.556
They just destroyed each other.

39:10.595 --> 39:12.519
I guess the other Wraith
didn't buy their story.

39:13.318 --> 39:15.522
Was either ship able to
get off a subspace message?

39:16.584 --> 39:17.848
Right.

39:20.042 --> 39:21.094
Negative.

39:21.347 --> 39:22.654
We're good.

39:27.972 --> 39:29.328
John, you can stand down.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.367
Gladly.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.912
I'm taking him back to Vadeena,

39:57.049 --> 39:58.927
to be buried according to our custom.

39:59.050 --> 40:00.817
It is good that he is going home.

40:01.145 --> 40:03.403
I don't know what my people
will do without him.

40:03.721 --> 40:07.421
He's always been there, warning us
of danger, protecting us from harm.

40:07.848 --> 40:09.493
Now for the first time in my life,

40:10.356 --> 40:12.079
I fear the future.

40:13.189 --> 40:15.006
Just because something is unknown

40:15.126 --> 40:17.960
does not necessarily mean
it needs to be feared.

40:19.010 --> 40:20.546
Trust yourself,

40:21.142 --> 40:23.849
and the rest will unfold
as it is meant to.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.558
He was an interesting man.

40:38.255 --> 40:39.280
Yes.

40:40.948 --> 40:42.807
He knew that I was pregnant.

40:43.449 --> 40:44.529
Really?

40:45.554 --> 40:46.613
You know,

40:47.269 --> 40:49.900
pretty soon,
other people are gonna find out too.

40:50.938 --> 40:52.327
You're gonna have to tell them.

40:52.790 --> 40:53.985
I know.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.409
So all it took was the destruction
of my ship for you to finally trust me.

41:06.546 --> 41:08.555
No, not true. I still don't trust you.

41:08.678 --> 41:10.715
Take him to the lab.
He's got work to do.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.316
Well...

41:23.317 --> 41:24.318
this is awkward.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.131
Yes.

41:29.398 --> 41:30.696
For the record,

41:31.461 --> 41:33.118
I thought I was making the right call.

41:33.437 --> 41:36.121
It was a difficult situation
for everyone.

41:37.918 --> 41:39.776
I just have one last question.

41:40.277 --> 41:43.378
How did you know the two wraith ships
would fire on each other?

41:44.730 --> 41:45.797
I didn't.

41:49.668 --> 41:51.551
You going to put that in your report?

41:52.041 --> 41:53.764
It probably would be better if I didn't.

41:55.229 --> 41:57.420
There may be such a thing as being...

41:58.183 --> 41:59.591
too thorough.

42:00.614 --> 42:01.750
Right.

42:17.306 --> 42:19.460
- Where's Woolsey?
- Oh, you just missed him.

42:19.614 --> 42:22.306
That hurts my feelings.
I didn't even say goodbye yet.

42:22.883 --> 42:24.120
How's McKay doing?

42:24.240 --> 42:25.960
He and the Wraith are back at it, but

42:26.124 --> 42:29.018
I guess they're having a problem
getting this virus to work.

42:29.157 --> 42:30.921
I'd hate to think
this was all for nothing.

42:31.041 --> 42:33.714
Well, we got out alive
and we kept our location secret.

42:33.834 --> 42:35.844
That still counts for something.

42:36.863 --> 42:38.886
You're still thinking
about those visions, huh?

42:39.022 --> 42:40.493
I can't get them out of my head.

42:40.613 --> 42:42.849
Everything Davos saw came true.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.993
For all we know, it won't come true
for another thousand years.

42:46.116 --> 42:47.852
- Or it could come true tomorrow.
- Right!

42:48.125 --> 42:49.517
So what else is new?
