<i>Young Gwen: Grandpa, is Ben
gonna be okay?</i>

15:40.007 --> 15:42.375
<i>Max: Yeah. Give him time.</i>

15:42.410 --> 15:48.248
I come 76,000 light-years, and
I don't even get a formal greeting?

15:48.283 --> 15:50.450
<i>Young Ben: Oh. Hey, Azmuth.</i>

15:50.485 --> 15:55.456
Ben: Wait, I remember this...
but from a lower angle.

15:55.491 --> 15:57.691
So, how is my greatest invention?

15:57.726 --> 16:01.695
You haven't blown it apart or
dropped it in the toilet or anything?

16:01.730 --> 16:05.098
Young Ben: No, I guess not.
- You know, you've been doing

16:05.134 --> 16:08.902
an awful lot of winning since you
took possession of my Omnitrix.

16:08.937 --> 16:10.170
<i>Young Ben: So?</i>

16:10.205 --> 16:17.277
"So", you don't learn anything
when you win, Ben Tennyson.

16:17.312 --> 16:24.084
Losing this transformation you
call Feedback was hard, wasn't it?

16:24.119 --> 16:27.153
Young Ben: Yeah. It felt like
he was a part of me.

16:27.189 --> 16:31.769
Well, you can let that one
loss define you from now on,

16:31.770 --> 16:34.060
or you can learn from it.

16:38.733 --> 16:39.967
<i>Young Ben: Did you?</i>

16:40.002 --> 16:41.869
Ben: Huh?
You can see me now?

16:41.904 --> 16:45.257
<i>Young Ben: Did you learn from it?</i>

16:45.858 --> 16:49.310
Ben: Yeah, that losing bites.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.112
Young Ben: Oh.
- Ben: Look, I don't think

16:52.147 --> 16:54.581
there's any big takeaway from
our big fail back then.

16:54.617 --> 16:56.850
Young Ben: Guess you're
still mad at me, huh?

16:56.886 --> 16:58.519
Ben: Dude, no, I'm mad at...

16:58.554 --> 17:00.420
[ sighs ]

17:00.456 --> 17:05.525
You know what?
Maybe I got to forgive you/me.

17:05.560 --> 17:10.130
Young Ben: You do?
- Ben: Yeah. We're not losers.

17:10.165 --> 17:12.833
Beating ourselves up is just
doing a favor for Malware and

17:12.867 --> 17:14.667
everyone else we ever go up against.

17:14.703 --> 17:20.373
So from now on, let's save the
beat-downs for the bad guys. Deal?

17:26.047 --> 17:28.048
[ beep ]

17:36.891 --> 17:39.092
[ crowd screaming ]

17:39.128 --> 17:41.227
[ thundering footsteps ]

17:41.263 --> 17:43.196
Malware: [ growling ]

17:43.231 --> 17:45.232
[ explosion ]

17:51.039 --> 17:54.107
Kevin: Uh, Ben?

17:54.143 --> 17:57.744
Feedback: Hey, everybody!
Did you miss me?

18:03.485 --> 18:07.387
Malware: The Conductoid?
Pathetic.

18:07.423 --> 18:10.078
I destroyed you once before,

18:10.079 --> 18:14.061
and I'm a hundred
times more powerful now!

18:19.534 --> 18:22.235
Feedback: Now I remember
why I liked this guy.

18:22.270 --> 18:26.205
Feedback rules!

18:26.240 --> 18:29.074
[ electricity crackles ]

18:29.110 --> 18:32.444
Malware: Aaah!

18:32.479 --> 18:34.446
Feedback: Hyah!

18:49.795 --> 18:51.763
Kevin: Aah!

18:56.035 --> 18:57.235
[ groans ]

18:57.270 --> 18:59.938
[ whimpering ]

18:59.973 --> 19:04.008
Kevin: Aw, poor dumb Mutt.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.409
Feedback: Ugh.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.711
I'm not making a dent in this creep.

19:07.746 --> 19:11.681
And sooner or later,
I'm gonna run out of gas.

19:11.716 --> 19:14.483
[ roaring overhead ]

19:14.519 --> 19:21.424
Malware: No! This cannot be!
I destroyed them all! No!

19:27.365 --> 19:30.835
[ snarls ]

19:30.870 --> 19:33.204
Kevin: You're welcome.

19:33.239 --> 19:37.174
Whoo! Yeah!
That's more like it!

19:37.210 --> 19:38.609
[ snarls ]

19:38.644 --> 19:39.977
Kevin: Ugh!

19:40.013 --> 19:40.678
Aah!

19:40.713 --> 19:43.114
Whoa! Good doggy!

19:53.358 --> 19:55.490
Feedback: There's got to be
some way to take this chump out

19:55.614 --> 20:01.765
once and for all.
- Might I suggest these?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.367
Malware: Aah!

20:03.402 --> 20:05.369
Feedback: The Mechamorphs!
That was you?

20:05.404 --> 20:08.973
Once the helixes were
repaired, it was a small matter

20:09.008 --> 20:12.777
to re-energize the Mechamorphs.
And I believe there's more than

20:12.812 --> 20:16.647
enough energy remaining
for your purposes.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.790
Feedback: Then
let's turn on the power!

20:25.826 --> 20:30.695
Malware: Curse you, Ben Tennyson!

20:30.731 --> 20:33.064
[ electricity crackles ]

20:38.370 --> 20:41.139
<i>Aah!</i>

20:44.844 --> 20:46.578
[ beeping ]

20:46.613 --> 20:48.679
Feedback: Ugh.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.649
Ben: Now, that was a total rush.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.419
[ crowd cheers ]

21:03.897 --> 21:06.799
Okay, Azmuth, I guess
we'll be going now.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.168
Yes, yes, goodbye,
Ben Tennyson.

21:09.204 --> 21:11.872
Ben: Come on!
Not even a "thank you?"

21:11.907 --> 21:15.259
You expect me to put
on some humiliating display

21:15.260 --> 21:18.611
of gratitude every time
you save a planet or two?

21:18.647 --> 21:23.650
Who has that kind of time?
- Ben: You're welcome.

21:23.685 --> 21:24.784
Kevin:[ whistles ]

21:24.819 --> 21:26.252
[ barking ]

21:26.287 --> 21:28.254
Ben: We're taking in another stray?

21:28.289 --> 21:31.557
Kevin: [ sarcastically ] Funny.
She's kind of growing on me.

21:31.592 --> 21:34.360
Gwen: It's a girl?
- Kevin: You really didn't pay

21:34.395 --> 21:37.163
attention in health class, did you?

21:40.134 --> 21:42.101
Max: Don't ask.
