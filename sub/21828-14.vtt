WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4 ...

00:04.583 --> 00:05.875
(Ryan) What's going on?

00:05.959 --> 00:08.625
I got a final audition
with Chrstph Frssll.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.542
If I can impress him,
I will be an assistant chef

00:11.625 --> 00:13.583
at his flagship restaurant in Miami.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.500
(Ryan) Remember the deal?
Use your money and your tech

00:16.583 --> 00:18.458
to upgrade the robot,
I take down Traeger,

00:18.542 --> 00:20.625
and it's game on
between you and me!

00:20.709 --> 00:23.625
I can control machines
with my mind.

00:23.709 --> 00:27.750
-That's just like my audition.
-I'm the pilot of Mech-X4.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.834
(alarm wailing)

00:31.917 --> 00:34.500
(Major Kingston) This way, this way!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

00:36.083 --> 00:38.166
Let's go! Lets' go! Move! Move!

00:38.250 --> 00:40.000
Sir!
The monster's heading downtown.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.834
We've lost contact
with the second battalion!

00:43.041 --> 00:45.625
(panicked shouting)

00:45.709 --> 00:48.333
(roaring)

00:48.417 --> 00:49.834
Sir, what are we gonna do?

00:50.625 --> 00:53.959
I don't know. Where is Mech-X4?

00:57.834 --> 01:00.375
Major, Mech-X4 isn't coming.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.959
If you want to save the city,
then you need to listen to me.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.542
(theme music playing)

01:47.291 --> 01:51.125
So... you're Mech-X4,

01:51.208 --> 01:54.625
and you control the robot
with your mind.

01:54.709 --> 01:57.083
And you and your friends
are part of a team

01:57.166 --> 02:00.125
that fight the monsters
that have been attacking Bay City.

02:01.875 --> 02:02.750
Yeah.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.250
-Pretty much it.
-So this whole time,

02:06.333 --> 02:07.625
you guys have been lying to me.

02:07.709 --> 02:08.709
-Uh...
-Uh...

02:10.375 --> 02:13.667
Okay! Uh, I have an idea.
We're tryin' to come clean, right?

02:13.750 --> 02:16.625
So let's play a game
of, uh, "Truth or Truth."

02:16.709 --> 02:18.709
Mm, "Truth or Truth"
is not a game.

02:18.792 --> 02:21.792
We're trying to get all of our secrets
out of the way at once,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.792
so, uh, Mark'll tell one,
you tell one, and I tell one.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.166
That sounds fun.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.500
Okay, great, Mark, you start.

02:28.250 --> 02:32.709
Um... I'm secretly a toilet texter.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.667
-Mm.
-Every time I text to you

02:34.750 --> 02:37.875
between 3:15 and 3:22,
I'm on the toilet.

02:37.959 --> 02:40.041
That's when you always text me.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.625
Right? Terrible. Okay, Mom?

02:42.709 --> 02:44.250
I-- I wanna know more about this.

02:44.917 --> 02:48.500
And you will, but we're playing again,
so... truth or truth?

02:50.625 --> 02:55.083
Fine. Truth: I don't actually
bake your birthday cakes.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.041
I buy them.
That's the gift I give to me.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.208
You didn't invent Choco the Whale?

03:01.959 --> 03:05.000
I-- I cook for a living, Ryan, I--

03:05.083 --> 03:09.250
Stop that!
Okay, your turn. Truth or truth.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.417
(sighs) Um...

03:13.291 --> 03:14.375
Uh...

03:17.333 --> 03:19.834
Okay. I was given this robot
to fight monsters,

03:19.917 --> 03:21.709
found out our principal
was part of a conspiracy

03:21.792 --> 03:23.375
to destroy the world,
almost killed her,

03:23.458 --> 03:25.625
and then we accidentally
blew up our first high school,

03:25.709 --> 03:28.500
defeated your ex-boyfriend,
found out the principal was still alive,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.458
went to search
for my birth parents, found them,

03:30.542 --> 03:33.083
cured them of a disease, and last week
we got stranded in the Arctic,

03:33.166 --> 03:34.000
and I went a bit crazy.

03:35.625 --> 03:39.041
Whew! I am so glad I got that off
my chest. Do you wanna see the robot fly?

03:39.125 --> 03:41.333
No, I-- I don't wanna see the r--

03:42.417 --> 03:43.959
Wait, the robot flies?

03:44.041 --> 03:45.834
-Pew!
-(chuckles)

03:51.250 --> 03:52.291
Woo-hoo!

03:53.208 --> 03:55.917
So the robot has wings? Or...

03:56.000 --> 03:58.959
(gasps, grunts)

03:59.041 --> 04:00.917
We have a jet
that attaches to the robot.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.375
Hi, Ms. Walker!

04:02.458 --> 04:03.709
New scarf, huh?

04:04.667 --> 04:05.959
You have a jet?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.417
Yep! And the first time
we tried to use it,

04:13.500 --> 04:15.000
we almost crashed into the city!

04:15.083 --> 04:17.250
-Who are you?
-Uh, I-- I'm new.

04:17.333 --> 04:21.250
Oh, and BTW, uh, the weapon's
new energy sig is on point,

04:21.333 --> 04:22.792
and is ready to be tested.

04:22.875 --> 04:26.291
Come on, Mom, admit it.
It's kinda cool.

04:26.375 --> 04:32.083
Okay, it is... a little cool,
but who would be insane enough

04:32.166 --> 04:33.542
to give this to a bunch of kids?

04:33.625 --> 04:35.208
Hi, there!

04:35.375 --> 04:36.875
Ooh!

04:38.166 --> 04:41.375
Wow! Anybody shocked that
that hasn't happened before?

04:41.458 --> 04:43.291
Welcome to Mech-X4.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.417
(Harris) Okay, we've added
the anti-ooze tech

04:51.500 --> 04:52.875
from our arm cannon
to the X-weapon.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.291
And you're saying
this weapon can take down--

04:55.375 --> 04:56.542
Traeger.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.208
Well, this is way bigger
and more powerful than ever before.

04:59.291 --> 05:02.166
-It's... a little scary.
-Ha-ha-ha!

05:03.083 --> 05:05.250
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be...

05:05.333 --> 05:06.291
fine.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.333
Wait. This could be dangerous?

05:08.417 --> 05:10.000
-Um--
-No!

05:10.083 --> 05:11.709
Between Veracity's
calculations, and--

05:11.792 --> 05:13.291
Jibbidy-bap!

05:13.375 --> 05:16.125
--ping on crunching the numbers...

05:17.208 --> 05:19.000
(quietly) Nice save.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.834
...this beam should blast him back
from the ooze he came from.

05:22.917 --> 05:25.250
And then, no more monsters.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.667
No more danger.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.542
-(beeping)
-All right.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.250
The Mech-Link is gonna measure
both the power and the frequency

05:31.333 --> 05:32.458
of the new weapon.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.417
Yeah, I rock these.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.041
-Ready?
-Ready!

05:40.834 --> 05:41.709
Ready!

05:41.792 --> 05:44.375
Mech-execute!

05:44.458 --> 05:47.083
Wait, you've been doing this long enough
to have catchphrases?

05:47.166 --> 05:48.500
Yeah.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.875
Yeah, it's getting there,
but, uh, the frequency's

05:57.959 --> 06:00.667
off by about 1.21 gigahertz.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.583
What do I do?

06:01.667 --> 06:04.166
Think of it like driving a car.
You need to step on the gas.

06:13.583 --> 06:14.583
You okay?

06:14.667 --> 06:17.041
Yeah, I can handle-- handle...

06:19.125 --> 06:21.041
-(grunts)
-Ryan?

06:26.417 --> 06:27.917
I-I can't stop it!

06:28.000 --> 06:29.834
How do we shut down the X-weapon?

06:38.500 --> 06:42.000
(Ryan screaming)

06:47.458 --> 06:49.709
-(Ryan screams)
-Emergency power shutdown!

06:49.792 --> 06:52.125
Victor! Crawford! Breath mint!

06:53.542 --> 06:55.458
-(screams)
-Ryan!

06:55.542 --> 06:56.375
Ryan?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh my...

07:10.333 --> 07:12.875
That burn is serious.
Ryan needs a hospital.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.542
(scoffs) Doctors!

07:14.625 --> 07:17.125
Ask a whole bunch
of questions we can't answer,

07:17.208 --> 07:18.750
like, what's your name?

07:18.834 --> 07:21.500
And how did you get
that burning "X" on your chest?

07:21.583 --> 07:24.959
But don't worry. My med-tech is so
super user-friendly,

07:25.041 --> 07:29.041
even this tiny boy
can run the scan. (chuckles)

07:33.542 --> 07:35.583
And bam... Ryan has scurvy.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.166
And needs an orange.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.583
I should probably update that software,
eventually, sorry.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.375
Okay, no, no. This is insane.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.834
We're not staying here. Ryan?

07:43.917 --> 07:46.083
-Come on, we're going to the hospital.
-Mom, I'm fine.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.083
-Mark, help your brother.
-Mom, I-- I don't--

07:48.166 --> 07:51.000
-Yeah, Harris does this thing all--
-Ryan Peanut Walker,

07:51.083 --> 07:53.250
get up off your butt.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.125
Move it!

07:55.208 --> 07:57.792
-Middle name, not good.
-Mom, I'm fine, please.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.458
Okay, guys, good news.

07:59.542 --> 08:02.417
It'll take some time, but I think we can
adjust the X-weapon

08:02.500 --> 08:03.834
so it won't make Ryan so crispy.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.834
Graceface! I am sorry I haven't called,
things have been crazy--

08:06.917 --> 08:08.166
-(grunts)
-(all) Ooh!

08:08.250 --> 08:09.166
Yes!

08:09.250 --> 08:11.125
Oh, hey, is that Krav Maga?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.542
Are you in Darryl's class?

08:12.625 --> 08:15.750
How is he still alive?
And what is he doing here?

08:15.834 --> 08:17.583
Mom, we need him to stop Traeger.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.625
He's helping upgrade the robot.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.291
So you're harboring the guy
who kidnapped me

08:22.375 --> 08:23.583
and tried to kill you?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.792
-The world's most wanted man?
-Ooh, is that true?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.583
-Did I get ahead of those pirates?
-No!

08:27.667 --> 08:28.917
Dude, not helping!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.333
That's it!
Get all of your stuff, both of you.

08:31.417 --> 08:34.792
We're never coming back here,
and we're leaving Bay City.

08:38.959 --> 08:41.250
-Middle name's Peanut, huh?
-(chuckles) Yeah.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.041
My middle name's Belinda,
and even I'm embarrassed for Ryan.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.667
Mm. (stifled laughter)

08:46.917 --> 08:48.291
Stop it.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.583
Oh. Hey, dude.

08:55.667 --> 08:56.875
What are you doin'?

08:56.959 --> 08:58.750
This is my first
"Most Handsome Player" trophy

08:58.834 --> 09:00.208
from baseball camp.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.834
I cannot risk breaking this.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.667
(sighs)
Why was that even an award?

09:06.542 --> 09:08.208
No, I mean, stop packing.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.583
We can't leave.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.166
Yes, we can.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.333
Your Aunt Gloria's
gonna put us up in Miami

09:15.417 --> 09:17.083
until we can find our own place.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.542
(sighs) No.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.959
Aunt Gloria makes me
scrape off her dead skin.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.750
It's everywhere.
Like everywhere.

09:25.375 --> 09:28.583
Mom, we can't leave.
Bay City needs us.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.417
Ryan, I'm doing this for you.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.750
You're just a teenager.

09:31.834 --> 09:35.542
You should be worrying
about grades and girls.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.792
You shouldn't have the burden
of saving the world on your shoulders.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.083
So we're just gonna cut and run?

09:40.166 --> 09:42.625
Leave Bay City to be destroyed?

09:42.709 --> 09:44.291
No, of course not.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.542
I'm gonna do
what I should've done in the first place.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.875
Give me all the info
you have on Harper and Traeger,

09:48.959 --> 09:50.875
and I'm gonna take it
to the authorities.

09:50.959 --> 09:53.417
They're the ones who should be
protecting the city, not you.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.667
-Mom, I'm the only one--
-That's enough, Ryan!

09:57.834 --> 09:59.208
Start packing.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.291
No.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.542
What did you just say to me?

10:06.792 --> 10:09.375
(sighs) I said no.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.458
I'm not gonna leave.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.583
I'll crash at Harris's
or Spyder's or something--

10:13.667 --> 10:15.583
No! We're moving!

10:15.667 --> 10:17.125
Because I said so.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.333
I'm not scared of monsters.
I'm not scared of you!

10:23.041 --> 10:26.083
Uh, okay.
Just take it down a notch, bro.

10:27.625 --> 10:28.625
You--

10:35.000 --> 10:37.875
You have no idea
what's it's like to be a parent.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.875
All I do is worry about you two.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.166
Are you healthy?

10:47.083 --> 10:48.208
Are you safe?

10:52.875 --> 10:54.166
Am I raising you right?

10:58.583 --> 11:00.125
And I'm proud of you two.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.917
The things you've done
are amazing.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.333
But do you know what it was like

11:12.375 --> 11:15.667
to see you hanging in that harness?

11:21.625 --> 11:23.083
I thought you were dead.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.375
Do you know
what that did to me?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.583
(sighs)

11:45.583 --> 11:50.458
You two are the most
important thing in my life.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.166
I can't lose you.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.417
And I can't let you
risk your lives anymore.

12:05.583 --> 12:08.083
(sighs)

12:18.542 --> 12:20.333
This is everything
we have on Traeger.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.917
I'm gonna take this to the military.

12:26.750 --> 12:30.709
Promise me
you won't go back to that robot.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.417
I promise.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.166
(wind gusts)

12:41.250 --> 12:42.417
(thuds)

12:49.917 --> 12:51.750
(muttering) Don't mention the veins.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.834
Don't mention the veins.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.792
Uh, do you need help
with those veins?

12:58.875 --> 13:00.750
Aw-- I mean, directions?

13:06.458 --> 13:08.458
-(beeping)
-Monster alert.

13:08.542 --> 13:09.667
Monster alert!

13:10.500 --> 13:13.417
-What do we do?
-Nothing, without Ryan Peanut Walker.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.417
(all laughing)

13:17.709 --> 13:19.458
-Peanut!
-Like-- Like the fruit.

13:19.542 --> 13:22.208
No, it's, uh-- it's a legume.

13:22.959 --> 13:24.542
-Not the time.
-No.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.875
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.834
(beeping)

13:39.917 --> 13:43.083
(sighs) Dude... we promised.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.458
-(screaming)
-(roaring)

13:50.542 --> 13:52.667
(Major Kingston) This way!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

13:52.750 --> 13:54.333
Let's go! Move!

13:57.625 --> 13:59.542
(roaring)

14:00.458 --> 14:01.333
Major?

14:01.959 --> 14:03.291
Mech-X4 isn't coming!

14:03.375 --> 14:06.083
If you wanna save the city,
then you need to listen to me.

14:06.166 --> 14:10.166
Here! Here, this will help you
beat the monster.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.709
We don't need
your crackpot theories.

14:11.792 --> 14:15.083
You need to take me seriously! The
information on this drive is important!

14:15.166 --> 14:17.792
My orders are to cease
engaging the enemy and pull out.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.041
Lieutenant, escort this woman
to a safe zone.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.583
-Yes, sir. This way.
-No, no-- no, no-no-- Wait!

14:22.667 --> 14:24.500
Wait! You're leaving?

14:24.583 --> 14:25.875
Yeah, we're pulling out of the city

14:25.959 --> 14:27.625
till we can come back
with reinforcements.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.125
-Well, how long will that take?
-Forty-eight hours.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.834
The city will be rubble by then!

14:31.917 --> 14:33.583
Ma'am, I don't like it
any more than you do.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.375
-But orders are orders.
-Then disobey!

14:35.458 --> 14:37.375
You're supposed to be
protecting the city!

14:37.458 --> 14:40.166
That's not my call. Now I suggest you get
to a safe zone, and hope that--

14:40.250 --> 14:42.875
Hope? Hope for what, a miracle?

14:42.959 --> 14:45.875
No. Hope that Mech-X4
gets here soon.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.458
-Let's move out!
-Carry on.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.583
(grunts)

14:56.583 --> 14:57.750
(roaring)

14:57.834 --> 15:00.750
(car alarms blaring)

15:09.500 --> 15:10.875
(roaring)

15:10.959 --> 15:11.875
(screams)

15:16.291 --> 15:18.625
Oh! (gasping)

15:19.959 --> 15:21.959
(roaring)

15:30.250 --> 15:32.166
(roaring)

15:41.917 --> 15:43.667
Are you okay, Mom?

15:43.750 --> 15:46.000
You took the robot out
without my permission.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.000
I'm sorry, Mom, but we had to.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.750
We couldn't
let Traeger rip the city apart.

15:49.834 --> 15:52.291
Ryan, listen to me very carefully.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.792
Take him out.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.875
(laughs)

16:04.625 --> 16:07.125
You guys heard my mom.
Let's dust this dude.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.375
-Spyder?
-(Spyder) You got it...

16:09.458 --> 16:10.959
Peanut.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.917
(roaring)

16:35.041 --> 16:36.875
(roaring)

16:40.000 --> 16:41.458
What was that?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.041
It's hitting us with his tail.
Bringing up shields.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.667
We need that new X-weapon
right now!

16:45.750 --> 16:48.709
I'm recalibrating the power flow,
Harper's making the finishing touches,

16:48.792 --> 16:50.166
so Ryan doesn't get fried again.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.875
Yeah, let's not fry Ryan again!
Spyder, get him off us!

17:00.417 --> 17:01.834
(roars)

17:02.709 --> 17:04.000
(grunts)

17:06.542 --> 17:07.625
(grunts)

17:16.083 --> 17:18.166
(grunts)

17:24.333 --> 17:26.542
(roaring)

17:26.625 --> 17:29.250
Ah! The X-weapon's back online!

17:29.333 --> 17:32.125
Wait! The last time you used that thing
it almost killed you!

17:32.917 --> 17:33.959
Are you sure it's safe?

17:34.709 --> 17:35.959
Truth or truth?

17:37.417 --> 17:38.792
We never know if it's safe.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.166
But it's my job.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.709
(grunting)

17:52.041 --> 17:54.583
(roaring)

17:54.667 --> 17:56.750
-X-weapon?
-X-weapon!

17:57.875 --> 18:00.083
Mech-execute!

18:11.500 --> 18:14.125
Ryan, you've gotta amp up
the beam's power!

18:14.959 --> 18:16.667
You can do this, Ryan!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.542
1.9 gigahertz.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.959
2.3 gigahertz.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.083
Aah!

18:36.667 --> 18:37.875
Aah!

18:41.875 --> 18:44.500
(roaring)

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
We did it!

18:49.583 --> 18:50.875
We destroyed Traeger.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.625
We destroyed Traeger!
Guys, it's over!

18:53.709 --> 18:55.583
-(laughing)
- Yeah!

18:55.667 --> 18:56.500
Good work, team!

18:56.583 --> 18:58.417
- I knew you could do it!
- I knew you could do it!

18:58.500 --> 19:00.500
I knew you could do it!

19:00.583 --> 19:02.709
(Leo) There was some question
on his part.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.125
He was a bit of a negative Nellie!

19:04.208 --> 19:06.208
- Never!
- You still listening to us?

19:06.291 --> 19:09.083
-(cheering)
-I'm her favorite now.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.542
-(laughing)
-Today.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.625
Come here!

19:15.583 --> 19:18.625
So we're gonna stay?
And I can keep piloting the robot?

19:18.709 --> 19:20.917
Yes, we're staying.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.834
And I'm sorry, I know how much you wanted
that job in the restaurant.

19:25.917 --> 19:28.959
Yeah. The restaurant is a dream, but...

19:30.083 --> 19:31.291
you know what else is a dream?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.792
Watching my children grow up to be brave,
compassionate people.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.458
And you learned it
by being in that robot.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.959
Mom, it wasn't the robot.

19:43.041 --> 19:46.667
Yeah, Mom.
We learned that from you.

19:48.542 --> 19:49.417
(laughs)

19:50.959 --> 19:52.041
Okay.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.667
Oh, uh... one more thing.

19:57.792 --> 19:58.625
Seth Harper.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.917
Don't worry, Mom.
We're way ahead of you.

20:03.291 --> 20:06.208
Okay, let's do this,
we're gonna go in there,

20:06.291 --> 20:08.041
and we're gonna take him out.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.500
Okay.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.041
Wait, wait, wait.

20:12.125 --> 20:15.542
This is gonna sound crazy,
but... he saved our lives.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.000
He put the robot back together,

20:17.083 --> 20:19.208
and he helped build the weapon
that defeated Traeger.

20:21.166 --> 20:24.250
It doesn't matter, okay?
He still has to pay for his crimes.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.250
(exhales)

20:35.000 --> 20:36.417
I don't get it, where'd he go?

20:44.375 --> 20:47.250
Hey, guys!
I know, I know what you're thinkin'...

20:47.333 --> 20:50.542
where'd our best new buddy go?
But here's the thing.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.041
We kinda made a deal to work together

20:52.125 --> 20:54.667
until we defeated Traeger,
and guess what, good news,

20:54.750 --> 20:58.333
we did, so it's time
for me to say... sayonara .

20:58.417 --> 21:01.542
But don't worry.
I'm sure we'll see each other

21:01.625 --> 21:05.083
again... someday.

21:05.792 --> 21:08.125
Bye for now, buddies.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.000
(woman over radio) We have a report
of a possible intruder,

21:16.083 --> 21:19.291
7-6-0-2, check it out
and report back. Over.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.500
Ooh!

21:46.417 --> 21:47.959
(grunts)

21:48.041 --> 21:48.917
(groaning)

21:58.792 --> 22:01.667
(theme music playing)
