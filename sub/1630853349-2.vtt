00:38.840 --> 00:41.560
The Musk approaching New York.
Dubrovnik originating.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.560
<i> Musk from Dubrovnik</i>
<i>now arriving at Pentaverate HQ.</i>

01:14.760 --> 01:18.400
So Alice Cooper turns to the cop
and says, "You think you've got problems."

01:18.480 --> 01:19.920
"I just took a shit on a turtle."

01:21.440 --> 01:23.320
Turtle! He's not happy with that.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.720
-I don't like it. I love it.
-Hut!

01:25.800 --> 01:26.640
Oh!

01:28.640 --> 01:29.920
Ah, there he is!

01:33.640 --> 01:34.920
There's our man.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.880
-Yes!

01:36.960 --> 01:39.240
Welcome,
Professor Clark. Be seated.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.160
Now, y'all know I'm gonna expect this
every day, right?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.520
-Good morning, men.
-Good morning, Patty.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.480
Good morning, Patty.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.680
-Patty, are you wearing open-toed sandals?

01:51.760 --> 01:54.600
My eyes are up here, Mr. Baldwin.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.400
All right, listen up, Pentaverate Five.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.360
We've got a lot of work to do today.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.880
The Meadows is in three days.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.840
-What is it?
-The Meadows.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.760
-MENTOR!
-<i>Jesus!</i>

02:06.440 --> 02:10.560
<i>Every year, the Pentaverate meets</i>
<i>with world leaders in Switzerland</i>

02:10.640 --> 02:13.120
<i>at an event known as The Meadows.</i>

02:13.600 --> 02:16.920
<i>The Meadows is part celebration</i>
<i>of their achievements,</i>

02:17.000 --> 02:19.520
<i>part announcing</i>
<i>what impending global catastrophe</i>

02:19.600 --> 02:21.880
<i>the Pentaverate is going to tackle next.</i>

02:21.960 --> 02:23.360
<i>Kind of like Davos,</i>

02:23.440 --> 02:26.960
<i>except it's secret and there's an orgy.</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:31.960
Now Professor Clark
is here to help us resume the work

02:32.040 --> 02:35.200
of our late colleague Jason Eccleston,

02:35.280 --> 02:36.760
but first…

02:36.840 --> 02:38.520
-My man.
-…I have a few announcements.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.680
The main chamber bathroom
is officially out of order,

02:41.760 --> 02:44.800
so number ones only.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.040
Yes, I'm looking at you, Mishu.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.800
What? I did only number ones.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.960
That's a lie, Mishu, and you know it.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.920
Someone dropped a deuce in there.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.320
Yes, but in Russia,

02:56.400 --> 02:58.320
number one is poo-poo,

02:58.400 --> 02:59.960
and number two is pee-pee.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.880
Pee-pee is subordinate to poo-poo.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.880
Look it up! Wikipedia. What?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.040
I did number ones!

03:08.120 --> 03:09.600
Thanks, Mishu. I'll keep that in mind

03:09.680 --> 03:11.560
the next time
I take a dump in the Kremlin.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.400
Toodles.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.720
So this is what we do here?

03:17.640 --> 03:18.520
This is what we do?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.760
Tell you what,
why don't you just try and sit there

03:20.840 --> 03:22.720
and be stupid new guy for a while?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.480
-Stupid new guy?
-Strewth.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.520
Oh, I'm sorry. I… I couldn't hear you
over all of my advanced degrees.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.240
Advanced degrees.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.600
Here, they do not "cunt."

03:31.680 --> 03:33.800
-Come again?
-They don't "cunt" here.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.880
He's saying "count." He's Russian.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.120
Yes, one, two, three. I'm "cunting."

03:38.200 --> 03:39.240
-What?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.040
That's just nasty. You nasty.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.320
I put curse on you.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.200
-I'm sorry. Who… who is this?

03:55.880 --> 04:01.160
I… am the Maester of Dubrovnik.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.080
You the Maester of Dubrovnik?
Oh, that solves everything.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.080
The Maester?

04:06.840 --> 04:13.320
I'm here to investigate
the death of Jason Eccleston.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.880
Good day, Maester.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.600
Can we help you with your… bag?

04:17.680 --> 04:18.640
No!

04:18.720 --> 04:20.680
My Maenisters…

04:21.960 --> 04:25.840
…will take care of my net of regrets.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.880
I am Ergo.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.040
Ergo!

04:29.160 --> 04:30.320
And I am Anso.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.920
Anso!

04:36.520 --> 04:38.160
Come here, little pumpkin.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.960
Oh!

04:40.040 --> 04:42.800
Look at you,
<i>mon petit chou chou.</i> Come here.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
Ah!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Mmm!

05:01.680 --> 05:03.160
Mwah!

05:03.240 --> 05:06.160
-Come! We have so much to discuss.
-Yeah!

05:06.240 --> 05:09.600
Welcome to New York!
I'll take you to Fuddruckers.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.440
What is this fucking place?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.080
-It's the…

05:15.160 --> 05:16.120
…Pentaverate.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.280
<i>In 1347,</i>
<i>five learned men realized that--</i>

05:23.360 --> 05:27.440
<i>Don't you dare</i>
<i>hit that "skip intro" button.</i>

05:27.520 --> 05:28.960
<i>This is important information,</i>

05:29.040 --> 05:31.120
<i>and if you think</i>
<i>you can remember it from episode one,</i>

05:31.200 --> 05:32.800
<i>well, then say it back to me.</i>

05:32.880 --> 05:33.920
<i>Go on!</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.400
<i>Yeah, you can't, can you?</i>

05:37.000 --> 05:38.880
<i>Oh God, now I've run out of time, so…</i>

05:38.960 --> 05:41.480
<i>Uh, oh, uh, five men realized black plague</i>

05:41.560 --> 05:43.720
<i>not a punishment</i>
<i>from God but fleas on rats,</i>

05:43.800 --> 05:45.280
<i>became a secret society.</i>

05:45.360 --> 05:46.520
<i>The key difference,</i>

05:47.520 --> 05:48.520
<i>they're nice.</i>

05:58.160 --> 06:02.040
Welcome to <i>Truth Battle.</i>
I'm Rex Smith here, sheeple,

06:02.120 --> 06:05.320
here in my studios in Roanoke, Virginia.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.920
We're discussing the Pentaverate's
annual secret meeting of world leaders

06:09.000 --> 06:11.120
known as The Meadows,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.960
which takes place
in three days in Zermatt, Switzerland,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.240
near the Matterhorn.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.640
But first, let me tell you
about Rex Smith Male Enhancement Cola.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.760
<i>My cola will not only</i>
<i>enhance your performance,</i>

06:24.840 --> 06:27.040
<i>-but will increase your size.</i>

06:27.120 --> 06:29.480
<i>Rex Smith Male Enhancement Cola.</i>

06:29.560 --> 06:30.440
<i>You'll be happy,</i>

06:30.520 --> 06:34.600
and she'll be happy too,
'cause you'll get a boner!

06:34.680 --> 06:36.600
-<i> Until tomorrow…</i>

06:36.680 --> 06:40.240
-Stay awake and stay vigilant.
-<i> …stay awake and stay vigilant.</i>

06:41.880 --> 06:42.960
Ah!

06:43.040 --> 06:46.200
Now Ken, I got a plan
to get you into the Pentaverate.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.520
The only way is to infiltrate
through the Liechtenstein Guard.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.040
The Liechtenstein Guard?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.840
Yeah, it's
the Pentaverate's security force.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.800
I would infiltrate myself,
but I already tried once.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.960
You didn't get in?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.480
No, you have to be circumcised.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.560
I was gonna get it done, but have you
ever seen an adult circumcision?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.480
I have many times.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.800
Why?

07:07.880 --> 07:11.520
So instead, I rolled up my foreskin
and Krazy Glued it back,

07:11.600 --> 07:14.240
but that didn't work either,
'cause of the tug test.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.240
The what now?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.680
The tug test.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.800
Took away seven layers of dermis.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.040
Speaking of which, I gotta take a leak,
but the chemical toilet's on the fritz.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.960
We can stop at Big Dick's other hotel,

07:26.040 --> 07:27.360
The Old Log Inn.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.240
How far is The Old Log Inn?

07:29.320 --> 07:30.160
Not far.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.120
It's in the town of Nuts Deep.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.440
So The Old Log is in Nuts Deep.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.720
-Really?
-Do you have to repeat everything I say?

07:39.800 --> 07:41.800
Anthony, do you mind
if I make a phone call?

07:41.880 --> 07:42.960
Not at all.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.440
<i> Hey, Ken.</i>

07:46.520 --> 07:47.640
Mrs. Snee!

07:47.720 --> 07:49.600
I'm in Nuts Deep.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.200
New York? Hey, my son
played a hockey tournament there.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.400
What are you doing
in that town that actually exists?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.120
Okay, what I'm about to tell you

07:57.200 --> 07:59.400
is gonna sound
like a lot of balloon juice,

07:59.480 --> 08:04.080
but I think I may have found
a story so big I'd get my job back.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.640
Okay. Mrs. Snee,
we need you back on comms.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.240
Oh, uh, no, Ken.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.040
We've already replaced ya.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.720
I'm sorry.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.600
<i>I'm Darleen Windelchuck</i>
<i>with </i>Hard-Hit News.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.000
<i>You've just been hit hard.</i>

08:22.400 --> 08:23.520
Well, Reilly,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.000
I'm done like dinner.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.000
Hey, why are you feeling
sorry for yourself?

08:28.080 --> 08:30.600
We're from Canada. We don't give up, eh?

08:30.680 --> 08:32.840
There's so much to your story.

08:33.560 --> 08:34.880
And I'm gonna help you write it.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.320
Thank you, Reilly.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.240
I'm gonna get my job back.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.160
Did you know that dolphins can queef?

08:47.240 --> 08:49.080
What are you talking about?!

08:51.440 --> 08:55.400
I just hadn't spoken in a while,
and I wanted to feel like I belonged.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.600
Oh. Okey dokey. I'm sorry.

08:58.520 --> 09:02.600
Finally. I have to piss so bad
my back teeth are floating.

09:06.320 --> 09:13.280
Ergo, Anso, let us begin
the autopsy of Jason Eccleston.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.360
Woman, what made you suspect murder?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.440
First of all, it's not "woman."

09:19.520 --> 09:21.200
It's Patty.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.160
And B, I mean, look at his eyes, Maester.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.120
Jason used to have
beautiful brown eyes, you know,

09:28.200 --> 09:29.520
and… and then I noticed…

09:30.120 --> 09:33.680
-Ah! Eyes turned blue.
-Yeah.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.560
Interesting.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.440
-Ah, woman--
-No, Patty.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.720
Be gone with you.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.200
I'm leaving now.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.800
Not because you said, "Be gone with you,"
which is just aggressive.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.440
I'm leaving because it smells like dude,

09:47.520 --> 09:50.120
and y'all need
to wash your balls more often.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.040
Anso, document my findings.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.400
The victim is of masculine sex.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.960
Height,

10:01.120 --> 10:02.080
four cubits.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.200
Weight,

10:04.280 --> 10:07.200
17 stone.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.080
Ergo, vent the gas.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.120
Stomach contents…

10:21.160 --> 10:22.360
…Doritos.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.000
Possibly…

10:25.000 --> 10:26.400
…Cool Ranch.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.280
Pizza bagels.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.640
Little Debbie Cosmic Brownies.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.080
So he was poisoned?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.120
We cannot assume.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.920
Assuming makes an ass out of you, Anso.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.120
Just you.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.360
Well, we don't have a lot of time and so--

10:52.440 --> 10:54.880
-Yes, Maester?
-No, not you, Anso. And so--

10:54.960 --> 10:58.200
-Yes, Maester?
-No! I just said, "Not you, Anso!"

10:59.400 --> 11:02.880
And… d… d… so,

11:04.280 --> 11:06.880
what can we conclude?

11:06.960 --> 11:08.200
Murder, Maester?

11:11.480 --> 11:13.040
Yes, Ergo!

11:13.120 --> 11:14.440
Murder!

11:16.640 --> 11:19.080
Oh, wow! New York City, eh?

11:19.160 --> 11:21.840
There's the Empire State Building.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.000
It's a hoax.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.680
Holy jumpin'.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.680
Okay,
Kenny boy, this is Area 52.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.000
Ask for Sammy. He's the chef.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.840
He's got the security fobs
that will get you into the Pentaverate.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.880
Really? A security fob?

11:35.960 --> 11:39.520
That's all you need to get
into a secret society's headquarters?

11:39.600 --> 11:41.360
Well, that and a circumcised penis.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.320
But I already saw Kenny's fireman helmet,
and he's good to go.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.280
Anyways,

11:47.360 --> 11:50.040
Sammy's really into billiards.
Do you play?

11:50.120 --> 11:54.760
A little when I was in the Canadian Army,
stationed in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.120
Perfect. If you can beat him,
he'll give you a security fob.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.160
Tell him Anthony sent you.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.280
Will do.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.240
Ask for Sammy!

12:15.320 --> 12:16.400
-All right.
-Yes!

12:22.520 --> 12:25.760
Hey! Welcome to Area 52,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.880
where today's special
are my famous pork cheeks.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.280
Can I take your new world order?

12:31.360 --> 12:34.040
Yeah, you got the Chem Trail,

12:34.120 --> 12:36.560
and you got the Anal Probe.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.000
I think I'll go with the Chem Trail.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.920
And for the little lady?

12:42.520 --> 12:43.480
I'll just have a water.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.360
With or without fluoride?

12:45.440 --> 12:47.160
With fluoride?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.640
Your funeral, kid.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.640
-Ask him.
-Are you Sammy?

12:55.960 --> 12:56.840
Who's asking?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.240
I'm friends with Anthony.

12:59.960 --> 13:05.480
He told me that, uh, you had security fobs
to get into the Pentaverate.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.280
For that goofy fuckface?

13:07.360 --> 13:08.200
No.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.680
I'm not risking my fucking fob connection
for that lump of shit.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.640
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.
You kiss your mom with that mouth?

13:18.440 --> 13:21.560
I'll tell you what.
If you can beat me at pool,

13:21.640 --> 13:23.640
I'll give you a fucking fob.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.680
Okey dokey.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.520
You're on.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.920
There's the fucking fob.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.640
Mind if I--

13:31.720 --> 13:33.320
Mind if you fucking what?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.880
Hey, Sammy, you cocksucker!

13:35.960 --> 13:39.120
-Kick his fucking ass!
-The fuck you just say to me?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.040
Are you hard of fucking hearing?

13:43.120 --> 13:46.480
I said, "Kick his fucking ass."

13:46.560 --> 13:48.640
Don't you think it's weird
they're swearing so much?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.560
They're Americans.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.400
Hey, jagoff!

13:52.480 --> 13:54.120
You any fucking good?

13:54.840 --> 13:56.600
I certainly am.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.200
Me fucking too.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.160
-Holy fuck!

14:04.280 --> 14:08.520
Oh, yeah. Do it, old-timer.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.960
Ah, shit.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.400
These pork cheeks are fucking good.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.800
Yeah. My cheeks are fucking delicious.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.640
Hey, this fuck-stick
broke the fucking balls wide open.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.280
Going for the brown.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.640
-Oh shit!

14:26.160 --> 14:27.680
Straight in!

14:28.280 --> 14:29.480
That's gotta hurt.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.880
Fuck you! Fuck.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.920
Holy fuck!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.520
-Holy shit!
-You old fuck.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.200
-Fucking cocksucker!

14:38.280 --> 14:41.600
Seriously, why all the swearing?
Like, it's a lot, right?

14:42.640 --> 14:44.880
Does anyone else notice how weird that is?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.920
You know the one fucking thing these need?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.920
Mayo. But the fucking bottle's
all jammed up.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.720
You're putting that shit
on my fucking cuisine?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.240
-Fuck!

14:58.520 --> 14:59.360
Shit.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.560
I'm fucking sorry, man.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.480
How can Netflix be okay with this?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.400
The language in that last scene
was a little strong.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.920
Not quite the "fun for all ages" style

15:13.000 --> 15:15.640
we've come to expect
from a Mike Myers project.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.000
So let's see that scene again,
but this time,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.320
we've removed all the bad language.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.520
Enjoy.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.640
-Mind if I?
-Are you hard?

15:25.440 --> 15:26.840
I certainly am.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.080
Me too.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.680
-Oh, yeah.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.480
Do it, old-timer.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.680
Yeah. My cheeks are wide open.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.440
Going for the brown.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.120
Straight in!

15:44.640 --> 15:45.880
That's gotta hurt.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.920
Ooh!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.040
I'm just gonna go clean myself up.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.320
Then I'm gonna come back
and take care of those balls. Yeah.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.720
Off the record, is the Illuminati real?

16:06.800 --> 16:07.760
Yes.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.200
Both Beyoncé and Jay-Zed
are part of it, sadly.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.680
But don't worry,

16:12.760 --> 16:14.280
they're double agents.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.840
That's what <i>Lemonade </i>is about!

16:19.920 --> 16:21.360
Yes. Yes.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.280
Oh.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.480
Do you know,

16:23.560 --> 16:27.440
I don't think we were
prepared for her jelly, ultimately.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.880
Oh no. Hell, no.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.880
-Wasn't nobody ready for that.
-Really?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.160
-No.
-I didn't think so.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.840
Okay, gentlemen,
next item on the agenda.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.160
-Meadows decor and party favors.
-Close enough, brother.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.320
As you see here,
I've made a model of The Meadows,

16:42.400 --> 16:46.160
and I was thinking it could be
kind of like a <i>Game of Thrones </i>thing.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.840
I've even put in a moon door.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.360
Look at this.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.480
Bye-bye.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.200
Ah!

16:55.320 --> 17:00.480
And Gwyneth Paltrow has agreed
to have Goop do the gift bags.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.720
She's even throwing in some of her…

17:02.800 --> 17:04.640
-…vibrating eggs.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.560
You know,

17:06.640 --> 17:07.920
for shits and Kegels.

17:11.760 --> 17:12.840
All right, gentlemen,

17:13.880 --> 17:15.760
you know what you have to do.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.480
Are we seriously
talking about party favors?

17:29.560 --> 17:33.040
The Pentaverate is
a secret global organization

17:33.120 --> 17:34.880
dedicated to solving the world's problems.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.400
Things like food insecurity,
microplastic pollution,

17:39.240 --> 17:41.800
clean water, sex trafficking.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.040
Yes.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.720
Too many women
in my country involved in this.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.680
Agreed. Prostitution
is modern-day slavery.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.400
And when they show up at hotel,
they don't look like picture on website.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.560
Wait, hold on now. What now?

17:53.640 --> 17:56.400
And when you order twins,
they just send over two girls

17:56.480 --> 17:57.600
with same colored wig.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.720
-Oh!
-This is not twins.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.400
I want real twins!

18:01.480 --> 18:04.400
Conjoined at hip like God intended!

18:04.480 --> 18:06.840
-Uh, thank you, Mishu. Thank you.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.080
I thought you all brought me here
to solve climate change

18:10.160 --> 18:11.400
in time for The Meadows?

18:11.480 --> 18:15.080
Professor, don't think of us
as the Almighty.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.040
Think of us as the alternative.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.680
Well, while y'all continue
to waste your time,

18:19.760 --> 18:22.400
I'm gonna work on cracking cold fusion.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.120
Something you need me to do.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.560
Something the world needs me to do.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.880
Rather dramatic, don't you think?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.920
You're the best. Give Apple a kiss.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.560
-Okay, great.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.960
Just got off the phone with Gwyneth.
She's gonna throw in the vagina candle.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.120
Oh.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.200
Okay, swipe the fob,

18:50.280 --> 18:53.080
get in the elevator, boom,
you're in the Pentaverate.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.840
These glasses are
an exact replica of yours.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.360
There's a miniature camera
with a microSD card in the bridge.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.680
It's constantly recording.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.440
There's a built-in microphone.
Hold the button, and we can hear you.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.360
Okay.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.480
Testing. Testing. How's your mom?

19:10.560 --> 19:11.720
-Oof.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
Crikey.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.120
Sorry about that.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.920
Ken, this is important.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.080
When you get in there,

19:19.160 --> 19:21.800
you gotta get footage
of the Pentaverate members.

19:21.880 --> 19:22.720
Right.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.520
Bonus points if you can get
the vials of adrenochrome.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.000
Adrenochrome? I can't with this.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.440
Do your research!

19:29.520 --> 19:32.560
That's how those pedos
get their rocks off.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.600
Got it.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.640
-Bye-bye now.
-Bye.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.160
Bye, Ken.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.000
Next!

20:04.640 --> 20:05.960
Come on in, son.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.760
Hold on a sec, it's Percodan o'clock.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.360
I'm Exalted Pikeman Higgins
of the Liechtenstein Guard.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.440
What's your name?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.480
Ken.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.760
Last name?

20:19.520 --> 20:20.360
Doll.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.920
Ken Doll?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.600
-Yeah.
-Your name is Ken Doll?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.040
Yeah.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.760
Are you married to Barbie?

20:27.840 --> 20:30.280
No, but I, uh… I do get that a lot.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.240
Tell me, why do you want to join
the Liechtenstein Guard?

20:33.320 --> 20:35.280
Wh… why? I, uh…

20:35.360 --> 20:40.680
Well, I wanted to change my story
and to change my life.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
Well, you've come to the right place.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.680
Oh, okay.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.320
Before this,
I was a stuntman in Hollywood.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.040
Westerns, mostly.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.680
Then Hollywood changed.
Heroes became ambiguous.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.720
Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy?

20:52.800 --> 20:56.920
-Is that why you stopped being a stuntman?
-No, I broke my taint on a pommel horse.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.960
You got any military experience?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.400
Yes. I was in the Canadian Army.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.000
They have an army? Just kidding.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.240
-Hilarious.
-Just one more question.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.480
Midge.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.640
Midge?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.320
Barbie's best friend.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.120
Have you met her?

21:16.200 --> 21:20.000
I think I have to be a little honest
with you. I made up the name Ken Doll.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.800
Ah, shit.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.000
All right, raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.000
The Pentaverate must never be exposed.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.440
The Pentaverate must never be exposed.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.560
Now make your way over to Katie in HR.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.360
-That's it?
-That's it.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.480
No tug test?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.200
Oh yeah, I plumb forgot.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.920
Drop 'em, soldier.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.320
-Now, this is gonna hurt you

21:41.400 --> 21:43.960
a lot more than it's gonna hurt me.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.440
Do you need a bite belt?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.080
Do I? I mean, I've never--

22:00.840 --> 22:01.840
Oh f…

22:02.560 --> 22:04.160
That'll be Ken's tug test.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.320
We can only pray to God
his foreskin holds.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.200
Dear Lord, please let Ken's…

22:10.760 --> 22:12.080
No, I can't say that to God.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.000
No.

22:16.040 --> 22:20.040
<i>It is officially nighttime.</i>
<i>Good night, Pentaverate HQ.</i>

22:21.400 --> 22:24.080
That makes the coefficient 4.9 E.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.440
Then, that makes E equal
to 0.2 to C squared. Is that correct?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.280
-<i>That's actually correct.</i>
-Good.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.920
<i> The Gaussian concept</i>
<i>of the elective affinity of molecules</i>

22:33.000 --> 22:34.360
<i>is inert in plasma state.</i>

22:34.440 --> 22:37.360
That's right.
We get the isotope to be stable then.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.640
<i>We're dealing</i>
<i>in fractals now, baby.</i>

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
Ah.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.480
Eyes so blue.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.480
<i>No,</i>
<i>use the protein molecule, fucknuts.</i>

22:54.560 --> 22:55.680
Thank you. I forgot.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.160
One of them is the murderer.

23:16.840 --> 23:17.960
MENTOR…

23:21.320 --> 23:23.000
can you give me the figures

23:24.480 --> 23:27.520
for the separation of hydrogen isotopes?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.960
<i>25.78 kilojoules</i>
<i>equals cold fusion.</i>

23:31.040 --> 23:32.120
<i>Confirmed.</i>

23:33.640 --> 23:35.400
I've cracked cold fusion.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.280
-There you are.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.440
See? This place still has
a little magic left in it.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.560
-Here you go.
-Hey.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.320
-And in time for The Meadows, man!

23:48.920 --> 23:50.280
To being dead!

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
-Mmm!
-Ooh!

23:53.440 --> 23:54.440
-Mmm.
-Mmm!

23:55.280 --> 23:56.600
-Mmm! You know what?
-Ah!

23:57.200 --> 23:58.680
I feel more alive

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
than when I was

24:01.400 --> 24:02.240
alive.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.640
-Yeah.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.160
Hey, um, let me ask you something.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.240
-Yeah.
-Be honest.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.400
Sure.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.200
Did y'all bring me into the Pentaverate
because I was a brother?

24:14.960 --> 24:15.960
No.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.720
You're here
because you're a brilliant scientist.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.600
They accept everyone, be they a Christian,
be they a gay, be they a cripple,

24:23.680 --> 24:25.760
be they a spinster, be they a fatty,

24:25.840 --> 24:27.800
be they a simpleton, be they an ugger--

24:27.880 --> 24:29.280
-Got it.
-Yeah.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.840
-I got it.
-Yeah.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.360
If you wanna stick it to the man,

24:33.920 --> 24:34.960
stick around.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.640
Here's to being dead.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.160
Well, this old Aussie's gonna hit the hay.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
Oh. All right.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.160
Professor,

24:50.120 --> 24:51.440
congratulations.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.840
Well, thank you, mate.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.040
Lovely, lovely. All right. Okay.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.520
Hey, Bruce.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.800
The Pentaverate must never be exposed.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.120
Welcome aboard.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.400
Oh my God, I thought he'd never leave!

25:16.480 --> 25:18.320
-Patty!
-What? What?

25:18.400 --> 25:19.840
-I… I've done it.
-What?

25:19.920 --> 25:22.680
-This is the greatest moment of my life.
-What?

25:22.760 --> 25:23.960
I cracked cold fusion.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.480
Yes! All right!

25:25.560 --> 25:28.000
-Oh!

25:28.080 --> 25:31.400
I knew you had the right stuff
the moment you walked through that door.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.720
I mean, I did it, right?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.360
-Yes, you did!
-I did!

25:34.440 --> 25:37.160
It's the funniest thing.
I was almost asleep.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.680
But, you know,
I was just laying there.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.160
I just couldn't sleep.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.960
-Maybe you don't need to sleep.
-Oh?

25:44.640 --> 25:46.040
Maybe, um,

25:46.120 --> 25:47.400
you need to join me.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.240
-Oh?
-And we take a walk on the moon.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.440
-Oh yeah.
-And we look at the stars.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.000
-Oh!
-Hmm?

25:54.080 --> 25:57.240
They're so, so beautiful.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.200
You know, this crater right here
is called the Sea of Tranquility.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.480
Is that so?

26:01.560 --> 26:02.760
Mm-hmm.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.800
Well, then,

26:04.880 --> 26:06.520
let's make some waves.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.280
-Oh yeah.
-Okay.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.640
<i>Good morning, Pentaverate.</i>

26:26.120 --> 26:27.200
<i>A reminder,</i>

26:27.280 --> 26:29.600
<i>The Meadows is in just two days.</i>

26:29.680 --> 26:31.400
<i>I'm Maria Menounos.</i>

26:42.200 --> 26:43.920
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

26:46.360 --> 26:47.240
Oh my God!

26:48.680 --> 26:49.960
He's dead!
