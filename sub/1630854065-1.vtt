How about Delia?

16:11.673 --> 16:13.706
Did she ever make you laugh?

16:18.251 --> 16:20.317
You know, if you talk about her,

16:20.352 --> 16:23.221
it can help us get back to
the old Louis.

16:31.363 --> 16:33.528
I also heard you sang.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.629
What's your favourite song?

16:40.636 --> 16:43.241
"Ring Them Golden Bells."

16:43.276 --> 16:47.707
Can you sing a little for me?

16:47.742 --> 16:52.151
That's stupid.

16:55.552 --> 16:59.818
...Brown, and may be stubborn,
too. Rock pigeon...

16:59.853 --> 17:03.459
Few birds have been associated
with humans so closely

17:03.494 --> 17:04.823
as the Rock pigeon...

There's a visitor here for you.

17:21.842 --> 17:23.677
Come on, Louis,
your first visitor,

17:23.712 --> 17:25.283
that's exciting!

17:26.517 --> 17:28.088
Hmm.

17:29.553 --> 17:31.190
You can sign yourself out
for a few hours,

17:31.225 --> 17:32.752

17:32.787 --> 17:35.689
I can't leave here.
I live here.

17:35.724 --> 17:37.856
Tell you what.
You go see him inside,

17:37.891 --> 17:40.661

for lunch today.

17:46.768 --> 17:48.438
Hello.

17:48.473 --> 17:52.607
I guess you know Louis?

17:52.642 --> 17:55.181
- Hey, Louis.
- - You gonna be okay?

17:55.216 --> 17:56.512
All right.

18:03.521 --> 18:05.356
Do you know who I am?

18:06.359 --> 18:07.754
Uh-uh.

18:07.789 --> 18:10.856
Well, I'm from Ledding,

18:10.891 --> 18:12.429
same as you.

18:14.895 --> 18:18.402
Even now looking at you,
I can't help but remember

18:18.437 --> 18:21.504
that strange kid that used to
wander up and down the roads,

18:21.539 --> 18:23.209
barefoot and all,

18:23.244 --> 18:25.904
dragging a stick
or pulling a damn wagon.

18:32.385 --> 18:35.584
I used to drink with
Billy Dyson.

18:35.619 --> 18:37.850
Well, he never drank much
so I did the drinking,

18:37.885 --> 18:39.654
and then some.

18:42.659 --> 18:44.527
Him and I were playing pool
at TJ's

18:44.562 --> 18:46.661
that night your sister
Delia showed up.

18:54.869 --> 18:57.969
I just bought that old bar
actually.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.708
See, I'm in construction.
I'm gonna give it a new feel.

19:00.743 --> 19:01.809
A pancake house.

19:01.844 --> 19:04.745
You know, somewhere you take the
family after church.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.749
You... you saw Delia that night?

19:08.784 --> 19:10.751
Yeah.

19:10.786 --> 19:14.326
But I got right
with the Lord since then.

19:14.361 --> 19:18.363
Become a new man, sobered up,
AA and all that.

19:18.398 --> 19:20.563
Been raising my daughter, Rosie.

19:21.962 --> 19:24.732
Billy Dyson, he's tried to turn
his life around too.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.305
Become a man of God.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.968
He's got his own church
over there in Downey.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.410
Saving folks one at a time.

19:32.445 --> 19:34.511
Hell, I guess you could say
he even saved me.

19:34.546 --> 19:36.678
Why are you telling me all this?

19:39.683 --> 19:41.881
'Cause the truth is,
I don't know how much

19:41.916 --> 19:43.388
you remember about that night--

19:43.423 --> 19:45.324
The truth is for the birds.

19:49.330 --> 19:51.297
Do you have cancer?

19:54.764 --> 19:56.467
Why would you say that?

19:57.635 --> 19:58.865
Nobody knows.

19:59.868 --> 20:01.769
My dad had cancer.

20:05.445 --> 20:08.248
But Delia took her secrets
to the grave.

20:12.716 --> 20:14.320
Louis.

20:15.653 --> 20:18.885
You don't know the whole truth,
how she died.

20:24.893 --> 20:26.728

Yes, we're fine. We're fine.

Uh, no.

Is something wrong, Aunt Franny?

1:11:05.766 --> 1:11:08.932
He's not answering his cell.

1:11:08.967 --> 1:11:11.506
Oh, he should be at the tavern.

Like I said, I can't remember

1:17:23.506 --> 1:17:25.308
I was sitting here.

1:17:25.343 --> 1:17:29.444
Lyle and Delia,
they were over there,

1:17:29.479 --> 1:17:33.921
they were kissing,
all innocent at first.

1:17:33.956 --> 1:17:36.154
And at some point...

1:17:39.159 --> 1:17:43.293
Lyle, he wanted more
than just kissing ya know?

1:17:45.330 --> 1:17:46.967
And then what?

1:17:47.002 --> 1:17:50.036
I tried to tell him to stop,

1:17:50.071 --> 1:17:53.006

1:17:55.406 --> 1:17:56.944
Okay.

1:17:56.979 --> 1:18:00.112
He just laughed at me
and kept on at her,

1:18:00.147 --> 1:18:01.784
and then she pushed him away.

1:18:01.819 --> 1:18:03.313
Then he reached for her,
and he grabbed her shirt,

1:18:03.348 --> 1:18:04.754
and ripped it and Billy--

1:18:04.789 --> 1:18:06.855
- - That's enough.
- No, it's not!

1:18:10.993 --> 1:18:13.092
And that's when he
got on top of her.

1:18:14.964 --> 1:18:18.460
She kept fighting,
but he was too strong for her.

1:18:22.268 --> 1:18:25.236
Once he finished, you know,

1:18:25.271 --> 1:18:27.942
having his way with her,

1:18:27.977 --> 1:18:30.780

Somewhere along the line
she must of hit her head.

1:18:43.487 --> 1:18:45.355
She was all still.

1:18:53.002 --> 1:18:56.905
