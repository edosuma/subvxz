Hey, you're Ralphie Doyle's kid.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.703
The apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.096
You're a bum,

01:36.270 --> 01:37.749
just like your old man was.

01:39.055 --> 01:41.623
How 'bout you, troublemaker?
What's your name?

01:41.797 --> 01:43.190
Al.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.279
What? Speak up.
I can't hear you.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.543
Parker.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.675
Alden Parker.

02:21.402 --> 02:24.535
Well, are you sure
you just can't...

02:24.666 --> 02:26.798
No, no, I totally get it.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.105
It's fine. Yeah.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.326
Okay. Bye.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.588
Hey, Jess.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.024
You doing all right?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.852
Peachy, Nick. Just peachy.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.898
Ooh. She's using
fruit metaphors. Mm.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.553
My cousin is getting
married in three days,

02:42.727 --> 02:44.164
and the guy that I was
gonna take to the wedding

02:44.338 --> 02:45.817
just bailed on me.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.863
And now I don't have a date.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.430
Why don't you just go solo?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.040
Yeah, what's the big deal?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.563
If I go to this wedding
without a date,

02:52.694 --> 02:54.043
there are gonna be
a million questions.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.088
"Oh, why are you still single?"

02:56.263 --> 02:57.829
"When are you gonna
settle down?"

02:58.003 --> 02:59.701
Total nightmare. Well,

02:59.875 --> 03:02.051
don't worry,
I'm sure you'll find someone.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.576
Huh?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.970
No. Okay... Nope.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.190
Come on. It'll be fun.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.409
- No, it won't.
- There'll be some food,

03:12.583 --> 03:15.499
some music, dancing?

03:15.673 --> 03:17.849
Yeah, see, I'd like to help,

03:18.023 --> 03:20.025
but, um, I don't want
to do the Chicken Dance.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.462
You wouldn't have to do
the Chicken Dance.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.855
It's a wedding. Everybody
has to do the Chicken Dance.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.031
McGee.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.164
My bestest buddy.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.731
Don't look at me.
It is date night

03:29.905 --> 03:30.732
for Delilah and I.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.388
- What about Parker?
- The boss?

03:34.518 --> 03:36.172
- Yeah.
- Ooh. That'd be kind of weird.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.826
Very weird.

03:38.000 --> 03:38.783
What are we talking about?

03:38.957 --> 03:40.655
Knight needs a date

03:40.829 --> 03:41.743
to her cousin's wedding.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.312
And you're thinking me?

03:45.486 --> 03:46.922
Question:

03:47.096 --> 03:48.619
will there be a wedding DJ?

03:48.793 --> 03:49.968
I think so?

03:50.099 --> 03:51.013
Then I'm out.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.449
Sorry. I can deal

03:52.623 --> 03:53.624
with dead bodies
all day long at work,

03:53.755 --> 03:55.191
but wedding DJs? Mm-hmm.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.455
Mc
Speaking of dead bodies,

03:58.629 --> 03:59.717
looks like we've got one

03:59.891 --> 04:01.023
at a park in Philadelphia.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.546
Philadelphia?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.287
I heard the Philly office
is shorthanded,

04:04.461 --> 04:05.636
so we're helping out.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.247
Let's roll.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.817
All right, our victim
is Petty Officer Second Class

04:12.991 --> 04:14.732
Danna Calley, 25.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.691
A jogger found her
body this morning.

04:16.865 --> 04:17.866
Where's Jimmy?

04:17.996 --> 04:19.563
Still stuck in traffic.

04:19.737 --> 04:20.869
But from the looks of it,
she was shot to death.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.524
Got a couple of GSWs
across her chest.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.003
Yeah, the wounds look fresh.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.744
Probably happened last night.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.790
What was she doing here
in the middle of the night?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.661
Hey, yo.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.446
I found a watch
over by the grass.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.491
Must have fallen off
after a struggle.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.015
Mc
The victim's still wearing hers.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.234
Which means

04:38.365 --> 04:39.975
that one could belong
to our killer.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.498
Nice catch, Torres.

04:41.672 --> 04:42.673
Guys?

04:42.804 --> 04:43.631
You might want to see this.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.024
Don't say I
didn't warn you.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.377
Are those...

04:52.596 --> 04:54.381
Organs.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.383
Looks like a liver.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.428
And a kidney.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.865
Her body's not mutilated.
Those can't be Calley's.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.041
Then whose are they?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.784
The organs we found at
the crime scene are not human.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.046
They are definitely animal.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.135
Specifically, <i>Sus domesticus</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:12.703
and <i>Bos primigenius taurus.</i>

05:12.877 --> 05:14.314
Also known as?

05:14.488 --> 05:15.184
Pig and cow.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.794
Could've just said that.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.709
Latin makes me sound smarter.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.842
Uh, Kasie found Petty Officer
Calley's fingerprints

05:21.016 --> 05:23.845
all over this cooler, so it
definitely belonged to her.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.326
Now, what was Calley
doing with animal organs

05:26.500 --> 05:28.371
in a park at night?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.068
What about the body?
You got anything?

05:30.242 --> 05:32.941
Uh, time of death around
midnight, give or take.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.769
The cause of death
was massive hemorrhaging

05:34.943 --> 05:36.771
due to multiple gunshot wounds.

05:36.945 --> 05:37.946
These bullet holes

05:38.120 --> 05:40.165
are actually exit wounds.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.210
She's got one more on her back

05:41.384 --> 05:42.211
where the bullet
didn't pass through.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.169
She was shot in the back.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.736
Yeah, she was likely trying
to escape her attacker.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.869
The force of the hits
must have spun her around,

05:48.043 --> 05:49.653
which is how you all found her.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.177
Hey, Kasie.
What's going on?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.005
That watch you found?

05:54.179 --> 05:55.746
I pulled some skin
cells from the strap

05:55.877 --> 05:57.400
and ran the DNA.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.054
A hit came back.

05:59.228 --> 06:02.013
Meet Sean Doyle, 22,

06:02.187 --> 06:03.014
from Philadelphia.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.320
He's got a rap sheet

06:04.451 --> 06:06.496
for petty theft, drugs.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.063
Might be adding murder
to that list.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.847
And get this,

06:09.978 --> 06:13.198
Sean is the nephew
of a much bigger Philly gangster

06:13.373 --> 06:14.896
named... Billy Doyle.

06:15.070 --> 06:15.897
Oh.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.115
You've heard of him?

06:17.246 --> 06:18.378
Yeah.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.554
We were in juvie together.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.036
Did he just say...

06:25.210 --> 06:26.211
Yeah.

06:33.610 --> 06:36.308
Are you sure
that's what he said? Juvie?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.310
According to Kasie.
Jimmy heard it, too.

06:38.485 --> 06:41.444
How did we not know about this?
Was this in his record?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.533
No, but we only know his record

06:43.707 --> 06:44.926
from as far back
as he was with the FBI.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.623
We don't know what
he was doing before then.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.930
I wonder what he did
to get busted.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.714
I bet he stole something.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.499
Parker looks like
the thief type.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.239
Quiet, quick with his hands.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.285
Nah. I'm gonna say assault.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.156
You remember when
we first met him,

06:58.330 --> 06:59.375
the scuffle at the park?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.594
The man can throw down.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.813
No, I think you're both wrong.

07:02.944 --> 07:03.988
I think it's underage drinking.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.469
Where are we
on the case?

07:06.643 --> 07:07.601
Hmm?

07:11.474 --> 07:12.606
Okay, let's get this over with.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.608
Questions. Hit me.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.087
When were you in juvie?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.525
When I was 14, back in Philly.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.091
It was just for a few months.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.310
What did you get busted for?

07:21.484 --> 07:22.964
Dumb stuff. Stealing hubcaps.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.574
Yes.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.751
Continue.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.840
We were rebellious kids
with too much time on our hands

07:29.971 --> 07:31.538
and eventually
it caught up to us.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.627
And by "us" you mean you and...

07:33.757 --> 07:34.932
Billy Doyle.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.325
First friend I made

07:36.499 --> 07:37.761
when I moved there
from Chicago.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.764
We were in juvie together.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.159
The whole experience
was enough to scare me straight.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.553
The day I got out,
I swore to myself

07:46.727 --> 07:48.772
that I would do whatever
it took to never go back.

07:48.946 --> 07:49.773
You saw the light, huh?

07:49.947 --> 07:51.862
Yeah, I cleaned up my act.

07:51.993 --> 07:55.431
But Billy...
Billy took a different path.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.477
Saw his rap sheet.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.740
He made quite a name
for himself after juvie.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.133
Became a big thief,
made a lot of big scores.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.484
Have the two of you, uh,
ever crossed paths again?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.617
Sure. We're still friends.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.533
Really? A cop being
friends with a criminal?

08:10.707 --> 08:12.535
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
it wasn't easy.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.973
We had kind of a, uh,
"don't ask, don't tell" policy.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.062
But that's all in the past now.
Billy's been out of the game

08:18.236 --> 08:19.411
for years.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.456
Runs a market up in Philly,

08:20.587 --> 08:21.762
gives back to the community.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.373
He's... he's reformed.

08:24.547 --> 08:27.332
Unfortunately, can't say
the same about his nephew Sean.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.160
He's our lead suspect right now.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.510
Okay, so what do we know?

08:30.684 --> 08:33.469
Our victim is Petty Officer

08:33.643 --> 08:36.428
Danna Calley, 25,
single, lived in D.C.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.082
Worked for the Navy
Combat Documentation Unit.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.344
By all accounts,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.433
quiet, kept to herself.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.045
If she lives in D.C., what's
she doing in a park in Philly?

08:44.219 --> 08:46.917
My guess is she was buying
drugs from Sean Doyle.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.136
Six months ago,

08:48.266 --> 08:49.616
he was busted
for dealing

08:49.790 --> 08:51.226
in the very same park.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.924
You think this is a
drug deal gone bad?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.143
Where's Sean now?

08:55.317 --> 08:56.579
No one can find him.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.146
And the fact that
we found his watch

08:58.276 --> 08:59.495
and he's in the wind?

08:59.669 --> 09:01.628
Put a BOLO out for Sean Doyle.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.717
And reach out
to Calley's supervisor.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.936
See what she was doing
in that park.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.372
I'm gonna go see Billy.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.070
Hopefully he can
give us something.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.378
Colin, we're running low <i>
on coffee.</i>

09:13.509 --> 09:14.597
The freezer's acting up again.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.425
Ice cream's like soup.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.079
Just tell people
we're selling smoothies.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.080
We can charge more.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.391
As I live and breathe.
Eliot Ness.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.220
Hey, Billy, how you doing?

09:29.394 --> 09:31.396
What is it? You don't call,
you don't write?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.485
- Eh, I've been busy.
- Busy my ass.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.313
Colin, I want you to meet
an old friend of mine from back

09:35.487 --> 09:36.576
in the day. Alden Parker.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.055
- How you doing?
- Good.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.188
Or should I say
CSI Agent Parker?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.320
Uh, NCIS, actually.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.453
What's the difference?
Hey, you got time for a bite?

09:44.627 --> 09:46.237
We'll swing by the house.
Tess would love to see you.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.805
Unfortunately,
this is not a social call.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.807
Can we talk?

09:52.113 --> 09:54.768
Um, y-yeah, sure.
Come on, we'll go in the back.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.555
New kid?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.339
Colin? Yeah.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.472
He was down on his luck,
so I gave him a job,

10:03.646 --> 10:05.213
rented him a room upstairs.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.389
Oh. Look at you. Saint Billy.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.261
I'm trying.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.611
So, what's going on?

10:11.785 --> 10:13.264
It's about Sean.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.875
Have you heard from him lately?

10:15.049 --> 10:17.921
Not for a while.
Why, what's he done now?

10:18.095 --> 10:21.882
Not sure yet, but he's a person
of interest in a case.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.361
Homicide.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.451
You don't look so surprised.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.106
Look, I love the kid.
He's family.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.239
But he's damaged goods.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.895
I mean, he's got a deadbeat mom,
dad doing life over at Fayette.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.810
And I've tried to keep this kid
out of trouble,

10:36.984 --> 10:40.901
but some kids, they just, they
go looking for it, you know?

10:42.293 --> 10:43.643
When was the last time
you seen him?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.993
Few weeks back,

10:46.167 --> 10:48.212
I caught him stealing a couple
of bucks out of my register.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.171
I just lost it.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.260
Look on his face, I
scared him half to death.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.218
I haven't seen him since.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.569
You think Sean would be capable

10:57.744 --> 10:59.876
of doing something
more than stealing?

11:00.050 --> 11:02.662
If you're asking me as a cop

11:02.836 --> 11:05.403
if my nephew is capable
of murder?

11:05.534 --> 11:06.709
No way.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.146
But off the
record, Park?

11:09.320 --> 11:10.757
I don't know.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.628
Okay.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.195
Hey, thanks
for your time, Billy.

11:14.369 --> 11:17.198
I'll, uh, I'll call you
as soon as he turns up.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.634
Yeah, I'll make a couple calls
around the neighborhood, too,

11:18.808 --> 11:20.636
- and see what I can find out.
- Honestly,

11:20.810 --> 11:22.203
I think it's best
if you just sit tight

11:22.377 --> 11:23.987
and let me handle this.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.728
Hey, this is my nephew
we're talking about.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.774
Y-You expect me to sit here
- and do nothing?
- I know,

11:27.948 --> 11:29.776
but this is
a homicide investigation.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.691
You got to step back
and let me do my job.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.128
Billy?

11:34.302 --> 11:36.391
Please.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.001
I'll find Sean, okay?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.616
Petty Officer Calley
was a hard worker.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.402
One of the best combat
documentarians we've ever had.

11:47.576 --> 11:48.925
How long did she work for you?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.405
About three years.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.450
We'd send her out
to conduct interviews,

11:52.624 --> 11:55.540
research operation reports,
deck logs.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.804
Any recent disagreements
with anyone?

11:57.978 --> 12:01.329
Not that I could see.
Everybody loved her.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.766
Any drug use?
Addiction issues, maybe?

12:03.940 --> 12:06.726
Danna? She wouldn't
even touch caffeine.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.729
I mean, the only addiction
she did have

12:09.903 --> 12:11.600
was to possums.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.690
I'm sorry, uh, possums?

12:14.864 --> 12:18.389
Crazy, I know, but Danna
was an amateur mammalogist.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.565
She loved studying possums.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.262
Couldn't get
enough of them.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.611
In fact,

12:22.785 --> 12:23.307
she used to go out to parks

12:23.481 --> 12:25.005
just to film them.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.096
You got something?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.488
Petty Officer Calley was not
in the park buying drugs.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.361
She was there
videotaping possums.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.492
That's why she was there at night.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.451
Possums are nocturnal.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.408
They're also meat eaters,
which is why

12:37.582 --> 12:39.019
she had the animal organs.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.281
Did we find a camera?

12:40.455 --> 12:41.717
No, no. We're thinking

12:41.891 --> 12:42.805
the killer might have
taken them.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.285
But all the videos
that she took

12:44.459 --> 12:46.069
automatically uploaded
to the cloud.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.505
I hacked into her account

12:47.636 --> 12:50.595
and this is what I found.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.902
Heads up, it's disturbing.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.556
Here, possums.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.865
I said no! Got it?

12:59.039 --> 13:01.476
No! Screw you!

13:01.650 --> 13:02.956
I'm not afraid of you.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.609
I'm the one calling
the shots now, not you!

13:04.784 --> 13:05.959
That's Sean Doyle.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.397
Hey! What are you doing?

13:10.398 --> 13:11.834
No, no, no!

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
Calley wasn't the target,
Sean was.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.279
Calley was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.412
So what happened to Sean?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.631
He could have escaped,
could have been abducted.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.546
- Maybe by the shooter.
- We need to find him.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.852
Like, now.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.337
BOLO just came back.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.991
They found him.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.428
Canvass the area,
go door to door.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.646
Somebody must've seen something.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.867
Detective Dubrow?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.129
Agent Parker, this
is Agent Knight.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.435
We spoke on the phone.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.698
Yeah. He's over here.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.223
Who found the body?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.095
Patrol car a couple hours ago.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.879
Looks like somebody
did a number on him.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.272
Shot multiple times.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.708
Just like Calley.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.579
Detective Dubrow?

14:01.753 --> 14:02.624
- Yeah, go.
- We got a guy here

14:02.798 --> 14:03.625
says he's the uncle.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.409
Wants to see the body.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.672
Word travels fast.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.849
Keep him back, calm him.
You know the drill.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.242
Uh, no, he's not taking no
for an answer.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.288
Let me talk to him.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.550
I want to see him!

14:15.724 --> 14:17.247
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey! Hey!

14:17.378 --> 14:18.422
- I said get your hands off me.
- I got this! I got this.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.946
Is Sean in there?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.599
Billy, you shouldn't be here.

14:21.773 --> 14:22.644
They said there's a kid there
in his 20s.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.341
Is it him? Is it my nephew?

14:24.515 --> 14:25.386
Billy, listen...

14:25.516 --> 14:26.474
Answer me!

14:27.518 --> 14:28.868
I'm sorry.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.915
Why don't you go home?

14:33.046 --> 14:36.353
Be with Tess
and I'll stop by after, okay?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.181
It's my fault.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.966
I should've been there for him.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.532
There is nobody to blame

14:41.706 --> 14:43.186
except the guy
who pulled the trigger.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.754
Now go home. I'm on this, okay?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.061
24/7.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.933
Whoever did this to Sean
won't get away with it.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.849
No, he won't, 'cause I'm gonna
make sure of it.

14:54.023 --> 14:57.200
Billy, whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.159
You had your chance.
Now it's my turn.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.116
Hey, Billy.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.249
Billy.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.828
Cause of death was massive blood loss

15:17.003 --> 15:18.787
due to multiple
gunshot wounds.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
Kasie ran ballistics,
and the same gun

15:21.137 --> 15:23.923
was used to kill
Petty Officer Calley.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.186
So we're looking
at the same killer.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.188
It would appear so. Yes.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.886
The killer wanted Sean,
not our petty officer.

15:31.017 --> 15:34.368
She was just
collateral damage, so...

15:34.542 --> 15:36.500
who'd want Sean dead?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.894
I can't help you with that,
but I might have something

15:39.025 --> 15:40.678
to get you started.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.376
Uh, if you look very closely,

15:42.550 --> 15:45.553
you can see traces
of fluorescent ink, which,

15:45.683 --> 15:49.209
when you put this under
a U.V. light, it reveals...

15:50.993 --> 15:52.647
"Dirtbag."I know, not as cool

15:52.821 --> 15:55.650
as, like, a treasure map
or a hidden riddle, but, uh...

15:55.824 --> 15:58.435
Guess what, there is a club
in South Philly named Dirtbag.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.263
I'll bet you that
is the handstamp

16:00.437 --> 16:01.612
that gets you entry.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.266
Based on the
freshness of the ink,

16:03.440 --> 16:04.833
I'd say that Sean was there
shortly before his death.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.575
So, let's find out
what he was doing there.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.232
Director Vance.
What a pleasant surprise.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.277
Agent Parker, may I have a word?

16:19.935 --> 16:21.241
What's going on?

16:21.415 --> 16:22.807
I heard about what happened

16:22.938 --> 16:23.939
at the crime scene between you

16:24.070 --> 16:25.636
and your friend Billy Doyle.

16:25.810 --> 16:26.811
Is he gonna be a problem?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.770
Yeah, he won't be a problem.

16:28.944 --> 16:29.945
How can you be sure?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.947
Because I know the guy.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.254
He just lost his nephew.
He's upset.

16:34.384 --> 16:37.387
Billy Doyle being upset
is exactly what I'm afraid of.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.215
I read his file.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.217
Assault, weapons charges,
reckless endangerment.

16:41.391 --> 16:42.740
That's just the first page.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.612
All of that was in his past.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.093
He's not that man anymore.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
Let's hope you're right.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.275
Yeah, I completely understand.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.668
Well, thanks, anyway.

16:57.842 --> 17:01.237
Well, Sawyer's out.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.978
You asked Sawyer to the wedding?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.763
Wow, you got to be desperate.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.678
My cousin just found out
that I lost my plus-one,

17:07.852 --> 17:09.767
and now they're threatening
to put me at the kids' table.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.119
I am gonna find a date
if it kills me.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.772
Why don't you ask Jimmy?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.905
- Palmer?
- No. Jimmy Kimmel.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.776
Yeah. Palmer.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.039
Well, you know, I just figure,

17:20.213 --> 17:23.564
you know, he's busy,
with Vic-Victoria.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.870
Nope, she's at a sleepover.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.047
He's not busy. He told me.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.918
Ask him.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.660
Yeah, maybe I'll, uh, do that.

17:38.579 --> 17:39.362
Hello?

17:42.191 --> 17:43.497
- That's far enough.
- Whoa.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.151
You with the other guy?

17:45.325 --> 17:46.717
He send you
back here to hurt me?

17:46.891 --> 17:47.892
What other guy?

17:48.023 --> 17:49.546
I told him
everything I know.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.634
He doesn't have to threaten me.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.028
Was this guy stocky?

17:53.159 --> 17:56.031
Tough-looking? About 60?

17:56.205 --> 17:58.686
He was just here
asking about Sean.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.038
I'm gonna reach into my pocket

18:03.212 --> 18:05.301
and I'm gonna show you
my badge, okay?

18:10.828 --> 18:12.917
We're federal agents.

18:13.048 --> 18:16.312
We're looking into Sean's
murder, that's all.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.926
Can't believe he's gone.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.711
Were the two of you close?

18:23.885 --> 18:27.236
We had a thing on and off.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.195
I knew he wasn't
any good for me, but...

18:29.369 --> 18:32.763
Sean could be sweet
in his own way.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.505
At least, he used to be.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.333
And why is that?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.640
He'd changed recently.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.208
He became secretive.

18:42.382 --> 18:43.992
Started hanging around
with a rough crowd.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.733
Can you describe them?

18:45.863 --> 18:47.996
They only came by
the club once.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.738
But I do remember
this one, a woman,

18:50.868 --> 18:53.741
she... had a tattoo on her neck.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.351
Dragon, I think.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.527
Is there anything else
you can remember?

19:06.101 --> 19:07.407
Sean left
his backpack here.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.323
He was afraid it would get
stolen at his place.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.021
I didn't tell
the other guy about it.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.718
Maybe this can help you
catch Sean's killer?

19:14.892 --> 19:17.330
Was he stuck in the '80s?

19:18.374 --> 19:20.594
Thank you for your time.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.683
If you can think
of anything else

19:22.857 --> 19:25.555
or that man comes back, call us.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.691
Hey, Sandy.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.649
Uh, can I get a Reuben
to go, please?

19:32.823 --> 19:34.129
Thanks.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.351
All right.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.619
What's good here?

19:45.793 --> 19:47.708
What? Oh, uh,

19:47.838 --> 19:48.839
everything.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.189
Uh, try the Reuben, though.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.060
That is my favorite.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.932
Reuben it is.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.196
Just what the doctor ordered.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.678
Hey, you look familiar to me.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.377
Do you work over
at the, uh, medical center?

20:04.507 --> 20:06.205
Uh, no, I'm not-- I...

20:06.379 --> 20:08.990
I'm the medical examiner
at NCIS.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.907
Oh, wow. NCIS.

20:13.081 --> 20:13.951
You enjoy the work?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.779
Yeah, yeah, I love it. Uh...

20:15.953 --> 20:18.652
Really fascinating cases.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.741
Is, uh, is that one of them?

20:20.871 --> 20:23.613
Yeah. Gunshot victim.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.441
Just finishing up
his autopsy report now.

20:25.615 --> 20:26.877
Y-You think I can get a look?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.879
No, no, no. No, I couldn't.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.229
Come on, Doc, just a peek.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.709
It-it's part of an ongoing case.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.450
I-I really couldn't.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.632
How about now?

20:45.679 --> 20:47.071
You're Billy Doyle.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.072
There's more money
in that envelope

20:48.247 --> 20:49.248
than you make in a month.

20:49.422 --> 20:50.988
Maybe two.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.905
And it's all yours.

20:55.079 --> 20:58.213
All you got to do
is look the other way.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.215
I'm sure you're aware
that bribing

21:00.346 --> 21:02.348
a federal employee is a felony.

21:02.522 --> 21:05.264
Who said anything about a bribe?

21:05.438 --> 21:07.918
We're just a couple
of guys talking.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.007
I should get going.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.532
Hey, Doc.

21:12.706 --> 21:16.449
I don't need to use money
to get the things I want.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.713
I have other means
at my disposal.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.368
I don't think you want
to see that, Doc.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.065
Now, do you?

21:24.239 --> 21:27.373
Sandy?

21:27.547 --> 21:29.244
Would you please get NCIS
on the phone for me?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.642
I'll see you around soon, Doc.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.518
It's a girl
with a dragon tattoo.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.694
You find her, you bring
her to me, understand?

21:47.828 --> 21:50.396
- Whoa.
- Where do you get off, going after one of my guys?

21:50.570 --> 21:51.788
You're lucky I don't throw
your ass in jail.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.616
Relax, we were just talking.

21:53.790 --> 21:54.965
Yeah? The same way
you talked to that club owner?

21:55.139 --> 21:56.315
I vouched for you, man.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.142
Said you wouldn't
make waves,

21:58.273 --> 21:59.840
and this vigilante crap
ain't helping.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.407
I told you,
somebody's gonna answer

22:01.581 --> 22:02.582
- for what they did to Sean.
- Yeah, and I said

22:02.756 --> 22:04.410
I'd handle it,
now let me do my job.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.455
- Oh, you'll handle it?
- Yeah, that's right.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.761
What are you gonna do, arrest
him, and then in ten years

22:07.935 --> 22:09.415
he gets out for good behavior?

22:09.589 --> 22:11.721
That's your idea of justice,
not mine.

22:11.852 --> 22:12.940
Oh, you're gonna get
biblical on me?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.202
An eye for an eye, is that it?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.291
Yeah, if that's what
I got to do.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.555
You see, surviving out here
means making the hard choice.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.209
That's why when we were kids,

22:21.383 --> 22:23.385
you always needed me
to protect you.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.084
Because you never
had the stomach

22:27.258 --> 22:28.738
to do what needed to be done.

22:28.869 --> 22:32.873
Yeah, well,
we're not kids anymore.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.788
And the next time
you cross the line

22:34.962 --> 22:37.617
and I have to come up here,
I won't be coming as a friend.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.359
You know where to find me.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.284
Yeah, Kasie.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.462
I finally finished analyzing the
pager Torres and Knight found.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.115
Anything on it?

22:58.289 --> 22:59.116
Several phone numbers
from burner phones.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.901
I couldn't trace them.

23:01.075 --> 23:04.905
But someone paged Sean
sets of random digits

23:05.079 --> 23:07.211
which, after much
trial and error,

23:07.342 --> 23:09.388
I finally figured out
was a code.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.389
Code for what?

23:10.563 --> 23:12.086
Latitude, longitude

23:12.260 --> 23:13.827
and scheduled times.

23:14.001 --> 23:16.917
Someone was paging Sean
locations to meet.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.659
Looks like it.
And whoever has been paging him

23:19.833 --> 23:20.921
probably doesn't know
Sean is dead,

23:21.095 --> 23:22.575
because we just got a new page

23:22.705 --> 23:24.794
for a meeting later today.

23:24.925 --> 23:27.014
All right. Send me the location.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.059
Coming right now.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.938
Quarter past.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.375
Whoever this guy is,
he's not very punctual.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.160
He'll show up.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.685
How'd it go with Billy?

23:45.815 --> 23:48.731
You think he got the message?

23:48.862 --> 23:52.300
Who knows?

23:52.474 --> 23:54.520
He saved my life, you know.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.524
What, back in juvie?

23:58.698 --> 24:03.529
I was 14, scrawny, never been
in a fight in my life.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.053
When I showed up there, it was
like ringing the dinner bell.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.663
But Billy had my back.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.404
I mean, without him...

24:11.319 --> 24:13.756
...I never would've made it.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.237
I always felt I
owed him for that.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.894
Sounds like he was just doing
what friends are supposed to do.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.158
Yeah, and now I'm gonna

24:24.332 --> 24:25.855
repay him by arresting him.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.380
From the first moment
I got my badge,

24:29.555 --> 24:30.773
I was afraid this day
might come.

24:30.947 --> 24:34.342
And now that it's here?

24:34.516 --> 24:37.301
I'm not sure I can do it.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.174
Well, maybe you won't have to.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.350
I mean, you said yourself
Billy's changed.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.484
Maybe he'll do the right thing.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.834
Not likely, the way
he's been acting.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.229
Don't give up on him so soon.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.362
People might surprise you.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.323
Think that's our guy?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.761
There's one way to find out.

25:09.159 --> 25:09.899
Excuse me.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.814
Hey!

25:24.566 --> 25:25.872
NCIS! Don't move!

25:27.351 --> 25:28.396
You don't have to worry
about that.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.181
What are you doing here?

25:31.355 --> 25:33.401
Check my coat pocket.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.540
You're DEA?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.585
Mark Sisco.

25:43.716 --> 25:44.630
I was supposed
to meet someone here.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.371
Sean Doyle.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.636
Yeah. He was working for us.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.429
Sorry again about that.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.432
I don't usually hit
federal agents with my car.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.434
Serves me right for running.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.610
Just before you showed up,
I got a text from my office

26:08.741 --> 26:12.005
telling me that Sean was dead,
so when I saw you...

26:12.179 --> 26:13.310
Yeah, you thought
we were the killers

26:13.484 --> 26:14.790
and you might be next. Sure.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.618
Sean Doyle was your informant?

26:16.749 --> 26:18.664
Yeah, we busted him
on a drug buy

26:18.838 --> 26:20.448
about six months ago
and flipped him.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.015
I thought he could help us
get dirt

26:22.189 --> 26:23.799
on a suspect
we're investigating.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.322
Got a name?

26:25.496 --> 26:28.325
Kat Hanna.
Bank robber, drug dealer.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.588
Runs a crew out of Philly.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.241
Mc
Nice tattoo.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.417
That is the same woman
Sean's ex told us about.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.854
Charming.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
Hanna's the real deal.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.988
Methodical, dangerous.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.424
We think she's behind
a big bank score

26:40.599 --> 26:42.644
that went down
about a month ago.

26:42.775 --> 26:45.038
Problem is, we got
no evidence to prove it.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.127
And you thought Sean
could get it for you.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.390
He got close with her
and her crew,

26:49.564 --> 26:51.131
he was feeding us information.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.960
Maybe he got too close,
got burned.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.701
Hanna could've found out
Sean was an informant,

26:55.875 --> 26:57.006
killed him.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.487
He was a good snitch, too.

26:59.661 --> 27:00.793
That's the problem
with informants.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.403
They keep dying on you, right?

27:04.318 --> 27:06.625
Not if you did a better job
of protecting him.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.627
You got a problem with me?

27:08.801 --> 27:10.237
Yeah. Show some respect.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.717
The kid has a family.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.414
All right, gentlemen,
that's enough.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.503
If Hanna did
kill Sean Doyle,

27:15.677 --> 27:17.810
then she's also responsible

27:17.940 --> 27:19.376
for the death
of a Navy petty officer,

27:19.550 --> 27:20.377
so we're gonna need copies
of everything

27:20.508 --> 27:22.031
that you've worked on so far.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.903
Hey, be my guest.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.557
With Sean dead,
I'm back in the weeds anyhow.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.820
Maybe you'll have better luck.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.997
Than you, or Sean?

27:34.827 --> 27:36.306
Mc
Agent Sisco was right.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.134
Kat Hanna is no joke.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.354
When she pulled that bank heist,
her and her crew got away

27:40.528 --> 27:42.922
with $3 million
and left two bank guards dead.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.272
That's nothing.
You should see her rap sheet.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.926
It's like the greatest hits
of organized crime.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.928
What do we got
on Hanna's whereabouts?

27:49.102 --> 27:50.930
Unfortunately, not much.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.496
Hanna's smart, she
moves around a lot,

27:52.627 --> 27:53.976
doesn't stay in one place
too long.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.413
The DEA doesn't know
where she is. She's a ghost.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.938
So how do we find a ghost?

27:59.068 --> 28:00.896
Maybe I go undercover
in the Philly scene.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.246
Ask around. Make my
way in with her crew.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.987
That would take too long.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.381
We need somebody who's
already tapped in.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.383
Somebody who knows the terrain
and can ask questions

28:09.557 --> 28:10.906
without raising a red flag.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.517
You mean Billy Doyle?

28:13.648 --> 28:15.084
Parker, you can't be serious.

28:15.258 --> 28:16.651
Why not?

28:16.782 --> 28:19.523
It takes a thief
to catch one, right?

28:19.654 --> 28:22.091
Okay, I know he's your friend,

28:22.222 --> 28:24.441
but the guy's
a loose cannon.

28:24.615 --> 28:25.791
And after you tell him about
Hanna, what's to stop him

28:25.965 --> 28:27.706
from going all vigilante
and just killing her?

28:27.880 --> 28:30.796
Me. I'll ask him not to.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.015
I'll appeal to
his better angels.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.105
That is, if he has
any angels left.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.674
Oh, I don't know.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.763
People might surprise you.

28:49.815 --> 28:50.946
Hey, Billy.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.602
Park. You here to arrest me?

28:55.690 --> 28:57.039
Peace offering.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.649
Come on.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.782
You know it's your favorite.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.784
You know how hard it is
to find these?

29:03.829 --> 29:05.656
I sell them right out there.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.050
Yeah, but they were buried
far, far in the back.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.580
Better days.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.808
Reminds me of sneaking
into the Vet to watch the game,

29:26.939 --> 29:28.418
how we always would
try to steal beer

29:28.592 --> 29:30.029
from the beer guy, remember?

29:30.159 --> 29:32.640
What the hell was his name?
F-Fat Tony?

29:32.814 --> 29:34.381
No, no, Fat Tony
was the peanut guy.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.774
The beer guy's name was...

29:35.948 --> 29:38.037
- Moron Mike.
- Moron Mike.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.822
You'd take his beer when
his back was turned, remember?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.258
He'd scream,
"Hey, that kid stole a beer,"

29:42.432 --> 29:43.607
and he'd put his cart down.

29:43.738 --> 29:44.826
- Yeah.
- And then chase me.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.916
Twelve guys would
help themselves.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.179
Best part is,
he-he fell for it every time.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.662
- God bless Moron Mike.
- Moron Mike.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.142
Here's to you.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.236
Why are you really here, Park?

30:04.628 --> 30:06.282
We got new some
new information on Sean.

30:06.456 --> 30:09.677
He was an informant for the DEA.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.549
My nephew was a rat?

30:12.723 --> 30:14.116
Well, that's one way
to look at it,

30:14.290 --> 30:17.337
but another
is that maybe Sean was

30:17.511 --> 30:19.556
looking to get out of the game

30:19.730 --> 30:23.038
and was doing the right thing
for once in his life.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.693
Of all people,
you can relate to that.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.088
We have a name,

30:29.262 --> 30:31.699
someone we think could be
connected to Sean's death.

30:31.873 --> 30:32.918
But we can't find 'em.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.139
We're hoping you can.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.315
How do you know I won't put
a bullet between the eyes

30:39.446 --> 30:41.448
of whoever's name's written
on that piece of paper?

30:41.578 --> 30:43.929
Right now, we're not certain

30:44.103 --> 30:46.670
that this suspect
is 100% guilty,

30:46.801 --> 30:49.412
so you might be killing
an innocent person.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.850
Could you live with that?

30:53.895 --> 30:55.941
The Billy I know couldn't.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.733
I know you'll make
the right choice.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.178
Well, I hope you like
the kids' table,

31:16.352 --> 31:18.528
and, uh, chicken fingers.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.052
I will text Jimmy.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.402
Why text him? Just talk to him.
He's downstairs.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.099
I don't see what
the big deal is.

31:25.361 --> 31:26.536
Any word from Billy?

31:26.710 --> 31:27.842
Nothing yet.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
No, but I have faith in him.

31:29.844 --> 31:31.585
Mc
Well, just to be safe,

31:31.759 --> 31:32.629
we had agents stationed
outside his home last night.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.283
Never moved.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.590
The final toxicology report
on our victim.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.766
Unfortunately, nothing that can
help us I.D. the killer.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.942
Great. Thanks, Jimmy.

31:44.946 --> 31:45.904
Jimmy.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.909
- Hey.
- Good morning, Agent Knight.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.563
I was just wondering, uh,

31:53.737 --> 31:55.000
what are you,
what are you doing tonight?

31:55.174 --> 31:57.654
Oh, actually, I'm very excited.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.005
Uh, I have the house
to myself tonight,

32:00.179 --> 32:01.354
so I'm gonna make
up some popcorn,

32:01.528 --> 32:02.746
I'm gonna dig into
that docuseries

32:02.921 --> 32:05.097
on the history
of documentaries.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.750
And even as I say that,
I realize

32:06.881 --> 32:07.969
that's not very exciting.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.231
Why do you ask?

32:09.405 --> 32:11.277
Oh, nothing, I was just,

32:11.451 --> 32:12.582
just thinking, if you didn't
have anything to do tonight,

32:12.756 --> 32:15.107
that maybe you wanted
to go to a wedding

32:15.281 --> 32:16.456
with me,

32:16.586 --> 32:18.545
as my plus-one.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.548
Y-Your plus-one?
So, just you and me?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.376
That's not weird, is it?

32:23.550 --> 32:25.987
No, no. No, it-it's great.
I'd love to go, yeah.

32:26.161 --> 32:28.903
Great. Uh, it's a date.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.426
I mean, not like-like

32:30.600 --> 32:32.211
a date date,
'cause we're just friends.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.604
- Yeah, friends. Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

32:34.778 --> 32:38.043
Um, I will text you the details.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.610
All right. I will
see you tonight.

32:45.050 --> 32:45.920
Did you ask him?

32:46.051 --> 32:47.617
I have a plus-one.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.271
Oh, well, see?
That wasn't that hard.

32:52.448 --> 32:53.406
Parker.

32:54.711 --> 32:55.930
I'm listening.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.629
All right, got
it. Thank you.

32:59.803 --> 33:02.981
All right, Billy came through.
We got an address on Kat Hanna.

33:11.685 --> 33:13.426
Want to tell me what the hell
I'm doing here?

33:15.515 --> 33:17.125
Have you ever seen this
man before, Ms. Hanna?

33:18.474 --> 33:19.998
Face is familiar.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.521
Meaning what?

33:21.695 --> 33:23.653
Meaning we may have
slept together.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.006
His name is Sean Doyle.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.878
He was informing
on you to the DEA.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.881
About what? Our sex life?

33:34.055 --> 33:36.057
A bank heist
you pulled last month.

33:36.188 --> 33:39.191
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.280
Maybe this will
help you remember.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.499
And what's that?

33:43.673 --> 33:46.285
That is a 1909 Sherry
Magee baseball card.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.548
The last name
is misspelled,

33:48.722 --> 33:50.637
which makes it
extremely valuable.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.639
And only a few exist.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.554
Including one that was
reported stolen

33:54.728 --> 33:57.426
from a safety deposit box
at the bank you robbed.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.254
Didn't happen.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.822
Then why did we find the card
in your apartment?

34:01.996 --> 34:04.346
You searched my place?

34:04.520 --> 34:07.001
Standard procedure
with murder suspects.

34:08.568 --> 34:11.136
Murder?

34:11.310 --> 34:13.355
See, I-I thought
this was about a robbery.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.096
It is.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.141
Sean found
evidence that you

34:16.315 --> 34:18.360
and your crew pulled
that bank job.

34:18.534 --> 34:22.234
But before he could go
to the DEA, you killed him

34:22.364 --> 34:24.018
and Petty
Officer Calley.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.498
But that card isn't

34:25.672 --> 34:27.152
the only thing that
we found at your place.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.502
Yeah, we found
the murder weapon.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.940
Ballistics show that the victims
were killed three nights ago

34:33.114 --> 34:34.942
with the same gun.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.509
Your gun.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.467
Okay.

34:38.598 --> 34:41.253
Wait a minute, this is,
this is not my gun

34:41.383 --> 34:43.820
and this is not
my baseball card.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.605
Okay? Somebody obviously put
them in my apartment.

34:45.779 --> 34:46.693
I'm being framed.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.263
You said these people were
killed three nights ago, right?

34:51.393 --> 34:54.527
I was in Baltimore then.
All night.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.138
You have anyone
who can verify that?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.924
Well, no.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.102
Wait, wait.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.148
Only because me and my crew
were in the middle

35:07.322 --> 35:08.889
of robbing a jewelry store.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.325
So now you're a thief?

35:10.499 --> 35:12.066
I can prove I was there.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.763
I can give you details

35:13.937 --> 35:15.156
that are only gonna be
in the police report.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.376
I'm telling you,
I'm being set up.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.160
Parker,

35:19.334 --> 35:21.293
- we got a problem.
- Yeah.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.512
Our "Kat" burglar might
be telling the truth.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.558
Okay, two problems.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.648
I ran my ballistics report
through the database,

35:28.822 --> 35:30.824
and it turns out,
the gun we found

35:30.998 --> 35:33.305
in Kat Hanna's
apartment was used

35:33.435 --> 35:36.351
in a gas station holdup
18 years ago.

35:36.525 --> 35:39.398
Eighteen?

35:39.528 --> 35:41.226
Hanna would've been
just a kid back then.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.227
I have pulled the file.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.793
It was a one-man job.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.187
Guy fired a warning
shot into a wall.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.536
That's where the
bullet got pulled.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.016
Police ever I.D. the guy?

35:49.190 --> 35:52.933
No, but they had
a prime suspect.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.848
William Doyle.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.677
The murder weapon
isn't Hanna's.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.766
It's Billy's.

36:08.949 --> 36:09.950
Billy. Parker.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.778
Call me as soon as you get this.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.171
Thanks, Officer.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.781
Hanna was telling the truth.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.827
Baltimore PD confirmed
the details she gave us

36:18.001 --> 36:19.655
on the jewelry robbery.
Alibi checks out.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.091
Add another check

36:21.266 --> 36:23.442
to the Billy suspect column.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.226
Kasie just found trace amounts
of coffee grounds

36:25.400 --> 36:26.836
on the stolen baseball card.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.795
It's a unique blend,

36:28.925 --> 36:30.710
ground specifically
for one location.

36:30.884 --> 36:31.711
Billy's market.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.061
If Billy had the card,

36:34.235 --> 36:35.410
that means he was behind
the bank robbery.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.457
Sean must've discovered it
and, uh,

36:38.631 --> 36:40.720
Billy took him out
before he could squeal.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.026
So this whole time, Billy wasn't
looking for the killer,

36:43.201 --> 36:44.811
Billy was the killer.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.466
He was keeping tabs
on our investigation.

36:47.596 --> 36:48.771
Yeah, and when he thought
we got too close,

36:48.945 --> 36:50.599
he framed Kat Hanna.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.428
After all, it was Billy
who gave us her address, right?

37:02.655 --> 37:05.005
I apologize.
That was unprofessional.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.747
Can't be easy, man.

37:07.921 --> 37:13.056
Well, let's, uh, call Philly PD
and have them pick Billy up.

37:14.362 --> 37:15.929
Uh, I actually
called them already,

37:16.103 --> 37:17.713
when I learned that the gun
was his.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.759
Billy is not at home
or at the market.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.283
Maybe he got nervous we were gonna figure it out.

37:22.457 --> 37:23.676
Went into hiding.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.462
Put out a BOLO.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.596
Stake out the market
in case he returns.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.382
Hey, Parker,
where are you going?

37:44.566 --> 37:46.351
How'd you find me?

37:46.525 --> 37:49.745
This is where we always came
when we were in trouble.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.356
Hide out at St. Mary's.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.054
Yeah, only I'm not hiding.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.621
I just needed a quiet place...

37:57.231 --> 37:58.319
...to get him to talk.

38:01.888 --> 38:02.715
Billy, what did you do?

38:02.889 --> 38:05.021
Don't.

38:05.195 --> 38:07.546
Why are you doing this?

38:07.676 --> 38:09.461
He did it, Park.
He confessed to everything.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.027
He killed Sean.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.116
Didn't you, Colin?

38:13.247 --> 38:15.858
Few weeks back,
when I caught Sean stealing

38:16.032 --> 38:19.209
from my register, my market
wasn't the only place he robbed.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.255
He went upstairs and broke
into Colin's apartment

38:21.386 --> 38:22.822
and found the baseball card.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.694
Colin did the bank heist.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.741
Yeah, Sean figured it out.

38:28.915 --> 38:32.179
And instead of turning it over
to the DEA,

38:32.353 --> 38:33.789
he tried to blackmail Colin.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.662
So Colin shot him and Calley
and framed Kat Hanna.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.840
How did you figure this all out?

38:41.014 --> 38:43.277
Colin used my gun.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.149
I noticed one of them missing.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.542
He's the only person
other than me

38:47.716 --> 38:49.196
that knew
where they were.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.460
This mutt.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.767
I gave you a job,
I gave you a home.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.638
This is how you repay me?

38:56.812 --> 38:59.598
Billy, Billy, don't.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.296
Park, just leave.
You were never here.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.864
You know I can't do that.

39:05.038 --> 39:08.128
You want justice?
Then let me take him in.

39:08.302 --> 39:10.565
This isn't the way.

39:12.001 --> 39:15.178
Don't. Please.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.963
Billy, I'm telling you,
if you pull that trigger,

39:17.137 --> 39:19.661
I can't protect you.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.446
And everything
you've worked for,

39:21.620 --> 39:24.100
going straight
over the past dozen years,

39:24.274 --> 39:26.189
will be for nothing.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.713
I got to do this.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.671
No!

39:29.845 --> 39:31.107
Please.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.634
All right,
then I'll do it for you.

39:35.808 --> 39:36.635
I'll shoot him.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.201
What?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.551
Yeah, I'll say, uh,

39:39.681 --> 39:41.640
he tried to
go for my gun

39:41.814 --> 39:42.989
and it was self-defense.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.730
It'll be a clean kill.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.255
You'd do that for me?

39:49.256 --> 39:51.389
Yeah.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.353
Park, if you did that,

39:59.484 --> 40:01.616
you'd be no better than me.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.665
I couldn't live with that.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.278
Go ahead.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.236
Put your cuffs on him.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.637
Make sure a doctor looks at him.

40:30.602 --> 40:33.605
What now?

40:33.779 --> 40:36.695
I take him back, get a
proper confession out of him,

40:36.869 --> 40:38.740
one I can actually use.

40:38.914 --> 40:41.264
I had to get him
to talk somehow.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.919
You could've called me first.

40:44.093 --> 40:45.965
If you ever pull a
stunt like that again,

40:46.139 --> 40:47.836
I'll shoot you myself.

40:51.579 --> 40:55.453
You saved my ass in there. Thanks.

40:55.627 --> 40:56.802
Hey.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.675
We're a team.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.330
I got your back, always.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.550
Right, Fonz?

41:09.075 --> 41:11.904
Tell me the truth.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.428
You weren't really gonna
shoot him in there, were you?

41:14.602 --> 41:16.909
Hell no, but I had
to think of something.

41:19.128 --> 41:20.782
You son of a bitch.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.357
Damn, Jimmy.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.752
Palmer. James Palmer.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.536
Looking sharp there, man.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.538
I'm really excited, you guys.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.366
It's been forever
since I've been on a date.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.803
But not that this
is really a date.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.370
You know, Jess and I
are just going as friends.

41:43.544 --> 41:44.763
But, you know.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.547
Whoa.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.944
Seriously, Jess. Wow.

41:52.118 --> 41:55.034
Yeah, you look,
you look amazing.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.558
Doesn't she, Jimmy?

42:00.300 --> 42:02.520
- Palmer.
- Oh. Yes, uh...

42:02.694 --> 42:04.130
Sorry. Uh...

42:04.304 --> 42:07.742
Jess, you look beautiful.

42:07.916 --> 42:10.049
Thanks.

42:10.223 --> 42:12.834
You look great, too.

42:13.008 --> 42:14.793
So, you want us

42:14.923 --> 42:16.359
to take a picture of you by
a fireplace or something, or...?

42:16.490 --> 42:17.926
Yeah, we can do a corsage thing.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.537
Shut up.

42:19.711 --> 42:20.712
Jimmy.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.498
All right.

42:24.629 --> 42:25.847
Don't be out too late.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.370
Mc
We'll leave the lights on.

42:27.501 --> 42:30.156
And, uh, stay away
from that spiked punch.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.726
- Cute couple there.
- Yeah.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.643
You don't think they're, uh...

42:40.296 --> 42:42.429
- Definitely not.
- Nah. No.
