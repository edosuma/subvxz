01:29.657 --> 01:31.792
-What have you got there?
-(gasps)

01:31.859 --> 01:34.262
(laughs)

01:34.328 --> 01:37.698
-I hope you don't mind.
I snuck a peek. -No.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.135
-The scene where Adelle
confronts Hustings. -Mm.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.503
Right before he ties her
to the tree,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.272
and she's sure
she's going to die.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.374
Oh, my goodness, the drama.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.542
(chuckles)
You like that, do you?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.444
(sighs)

01:54.114 --> 01:56.650
"You don't understand us at all.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.519
"Americans.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.922
"You think because we smile at
each other at church on Sundays

02:01.989 --> 02:07.060
"and plant gardens and help
each other across the street

02:07.127 --> 02:08.862
"that we're pushovers.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.233
"But we built this place
from the ground up.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.067
"This country.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.871
"And there's not one of us who
wouldn't give his last breath

02:17.938 --> 02:22.109
"to stop you from harming
one branch, one brick,

02:22.176 --> 02:24.245
"one twig of it.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.615
That is who we are,
Mr. Hustings."

02:30.518 --> 02:32.653
I'm sorry, I mangled it, I know.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.427
I'll make us some breakfast.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.173
Betsy, would you take this out

02:53.241 --> 02:55.142
and put it in the trunk
of my car, please?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.944
Thank you.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.413
BRADY: I was hoping
you weren't serious about this.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.315
A painter. Really?

03:01.382 --> 03:02.750
It's for a friend.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.718
Well, that's a relief.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.321
I'm surrounded by
too many artists as it is.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.390
You know, Rose,
I always thought of you

03:09.457 --> 03:10.991
as more of a people person.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.360
Like you, Pat?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.362
Will you be home
for dinner tonight?

03:14.428 --> 03:15.829
I wouldn't wait.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.465
I've got drinks
with Sally Sweet's manager.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.300
Not an easy woman, that one.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.769
(quietly):
That's not what I heard.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.203
Have you seen this?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.241
We're developing your
anti-fascist picture, aren't we?

03:27.308 --> 03:30.344
Pictures take too long, Daddy.
We have to do something now.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.280
-Such as?
-Such as...

03:32.346 --> 03:33.414
a relief fund for European Jews.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.383
BRADY:
Relief for the Jews.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.817
I need relief fromthe Jews.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.654
What?

03:40.721 --> 03:43.190
Nobody can take a joke anymore?

03:43.257 --> 03:44.958
LANG:
We are all refugees

03:45.025 --> 03:46.960
from Europe, gentlemen.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.962
Some of us just got here first.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.999
Monroe?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.402
We're a movie studio.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.305
I think that's enough
to keep us busy, don't you?

03:59.206 --> 04:00.541
That's your answer?

04:00.608 --> 04:03.010
What about the fact
that you're Jewish?

04:08.282 --> 04:11.385
Get me Sy Green
in the music department.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.787
And have some invitations made.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.423
We're throwing a party.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.625
Right away, Mr. Stahr.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.329
(engines revving on-screen)

04:21.394 --> 04:22.796
You took the Nazis' own words

04:22.863 --> 04:27.335
and put them into the mouths
of criminals and madmen.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.570
Your idea for "Enemy Among Us."

04:32.773 --> 04:38.145
Goebbels banned my film,
but... but he can't ban ours.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.013
It's not enough.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.915
Movies are not enough.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.256
LANG: Next weekend,
there will be a dinner

04:49.323 --> 04:51.024
at the home of Salka Viertel.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.794
There will be
like-minded people there.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.664
Artists,
Ã©migrÃ©s from Central Europe.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.400
-(train whistle blows)
-(bell chiming)

04:59.467 --> 05:01.001
You should come.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.447
Fair warning: it's three minutes
to my close-up.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.282
You're easy to light.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.850
The glow from within.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.452
(laughs)

05:18.519 --> 05:20.921
Oh, Pat. Don't tell me.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.990
Yesterday's rushes
were the best so far.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.894
If you're tired of the same good
news every day, how about this:

05:26.960 --> 05:29.463
I got five more scripts
sitting on my desk,

05:29.530 --> 05:31.899
every bit as good,
waiting for you.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.268
Minna Davis's
unfinished library.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.905
You'll make them your own,
just like you did this one.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.474
Let's just get this one
in the can first,

05:40.541 --> 05:41.809
and then we'll talk.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.412
I already know
everything I need to know.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.980
I want Brady-American
to be your home.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.148
(laughs softly)

05:48.215 --> 05:49.917
You want to lock me up?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.652
In a golden cage.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.186
Of your own design.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.322
(laughs)

05:55.389 --> 05:58.626
(sighs)

05:58.692 --> 06:02.496
I got a message
you needed to see me.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.131
I've got a tour starting
in ten minutes.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.067
Well, you won't be late.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.108
I want to test you for Adelle.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.678
You were meant to play her.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.848
Trust me. After I heard you
read this morning...

06:20.914 --> 06:22.983
One speech, on a lounge chair.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.117
I know what I heard.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.519
I'm not an actress.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.387
I think you are.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.391
-You see how much I believe
in you? -(laughs softly)

06:31.459 --> 06:32.960
You're very sweet.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.996
And I'm glad that you love me,
but this is delusional.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.398
I'd have that destroyed
if I were you.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.234
People might lose faith
in your judgment.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.537
I'll see you later.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.544
It's quiet here at lunchtime.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.780
CELIA: Why does he want it?
It's not ready.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.616
We haven't finished
the latest set of notes.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.918
I'm just the messenger.
Please don't shoot.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.188
Okay, messenger, but tell him
no more notes until I say so.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.190
See ya.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.463
Is there something else?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.731
You want to go riding with me?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.466
-What?
-I had this idea

07:12.533 --> 07:14.134
you might like
to ride horses with me.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.103
Unless you don't like horses,
'cause I love horses,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.105
and I haven't ridden
since I was in Oklahoma.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.339
So I thought...

07:19.406 --> 07:21.475
Is this a date?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.611
What?

07:23.677 --> 07:27.748
No-- well, calling it
a date might...

07:27.815 --> 07:30.684
Besides, I can't afford
an actual date right now,

07:30.751 --> 07:33.420
with food and things like that.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.988
Maybe Saturday?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.927
I know I'm not much of a catch.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.762
-Max.
-It's just lately,

07:41.829 --> 07:44.765
you seem to be showing
some interest in those of us

07:44.832 --> 07:46.600
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.102
Unless that was just research.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.540
Oh, I'm sorry. Are... are you
asking me out or insulting me?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.942
Both.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.476
Definitely both.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.812
(chuckles softly)

07:58.879 --> 08:01.414
Well, I'm busy on Saturday.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.717
Otherwise,
it was a very sweet offer.

08:03.784 --> 08:07.254
And I do like horses.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.256
Cowboy.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.230
Tell the caterers
we'll be 40, at least.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.533
The usual guest list.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.102
And I'll take a look
at the menu tomorrow.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.471
Would you like me
to arrange for entertainment?

08:24.538 --> 08:25.839
That won't be necessary.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.947
(door closes)

08:34.014 --> 08:35.948
KATHLEEN:
You have to be honest with me.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.052
Was that idea for you or for me?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.921
Why would it be for me?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.724
Because I'm just a tour guide.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.561
I'm afraid
that you can't love someone

08:47.628 --> 08:50.230
unless the whole world
loves her with you.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.267
Is that really what you think?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.770
I'm asking you.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.877
All day long,
I am surrounded by people

09:03.944 --> 09:06.413
who want to be more
than what they are.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.548
Actors who want to be directors,

09:08.616 --> 09:11.919
directors who want
to be producers.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.822
You're the only one I know
who wants to be less.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.959
You have this--

09:19.026 --> 09:22.596
I-I don't have the word for it--
this... light

09:22.663 --> 09:25.332
inside you.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.768
Hidden.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.970
But I can see it.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.105
I can.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.440
That's my talent.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.809
It may be my only talent.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.145
So, you can hate me
for saying this,

09:38.211 --> 09:42.549
but... to stay a tour guide
and tell someone else's stories

09:42.616 --> 09:46.286
when someone else should be
telling stories about you...

09:48.922 --> 09:51.224
We live a short time, Kathleen.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.393
And what would happen?

09:53.460 --> 09:56.563
I mean...

09:56.630 --> 10:01.568
who would direct
the screen test?

10:01.635 --> 10:04.337
I would.

10:04.404 --> 10:07.741
For now, you're my secret.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.013
He said I have something.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.682
-Your drama teacher?
-Mm-hmm.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.916
-Said you have something?
-Yes.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.184
I think he meant cooties.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.119
-Shut up, Nathan.
-What do you have?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.924
Possibilities, to stand out.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.861
So, I-I was thinking,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.831
if you could introduce me
to a producer on the lot.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.033
Like what happened to Lana.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.103
Okay.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.405
Okay, uh, I could
think about that.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.042
I might just have to work
a little bit longer first.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.044
I'd need to get photographs.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.213
-But they want a picture of you
that they can keep. -Mm-mm.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.881
-We can't afford that.
-Well, you borrowed money

10:47.948 --> 10:49.349
-to get a new suit.
-That's different.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.751
No, it isn't.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.885
And you're planning
these dates with Celia.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.086
That costs money.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.760
Being a movie star is
pie in the sky.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.263
You and the boss's daughter
is pie in the sky.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.702
I didn't walk all the way
from Oklahoma just for this.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.904
Just so you know.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.416
* *

11:40.367 --> 11:41.501
Ah.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.736
Guten Morgen.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.104
Mein name ist Monroe Stahr.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.438
Leopold Ferber, Mr. Stahr.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.941
I-I speak English. I-I try.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.476
I am the konzertmeister
of the orchestra.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.080
Ah, welcome to Brady-American,
Mr. Ferber.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.282
-(clears throat) Guten Morgen.
-MAN: Hello.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.086
Willkommen.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.724
Hallo.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.261
(Stahr continues
speaking German)

12:11.865 --> 12:14.501
Guten Morgen.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.503
(orchestral music plays)

12:18.972 --> 12:20.908
Fantastic. Let's roll that back.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.576
"Angels on the Avenue,"
cue number one.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.744
(orchestral music continues)

12:24.812 --> 12:26.713
Our weekly meeting?

12:26.780 --> 12:29.482
I waited in your office
for half an hour.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.084
Sounds like my mistake.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.086
I read the latest set of drafts

12:33.153 --> 12:35.889
and left my notes
for your secretary.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.993
I have to commend you.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.361
The Vienna National Orchestra

12:41.428 --> 12:44.431
has always been
my personal favorite.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.903
But that's quite an expense,

12:49.970 --> 12:53.040
traveling an entire orchestra
across an ocean.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.809
They were playing in Chicago.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.611
I arranged for them
to extend their stay.

12:58.678 --> 13:03.016
We Germanic peoples do have
a certain knack for Romanticism.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.554
I somehow doubt that's how
you're going to be remembered.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.556
Star that one.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.592
* *

13:12.659 --> 13:14.794
(indistinct chatter in German)

13:23.236 --> 13:26.039
Hello.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.941
Do you speak English?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.910
Ein bisschen.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.444
A little.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.981
I studied in school.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.515
I'm Aubrey Hackett.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.751
Hannah Taub.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.588
Yeah, I-I'm one of the writers.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.755
Hmm.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.324
Did you write this movie?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.327
No.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.100
Nice to meet you, anyway.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.336
Are you excited...
to be in Hollywood?

13:56.403 --> 13:57.504
What?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.073
Hollywood. Are you...

14:00.140 --> 14:02.542
-Are you excited?
-I'm a musician.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.612
Vienna is the capital of music.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.548
So now I am in your capital.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.283
I would prefer to be home.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.988
Well, we do have
Schoenberg now, you know.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.200
GYSSLING:
Leo?

14:59.099 --> 15:02.002
It's good we meet
in America, then.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.104
Here we can still speak.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.574
I would say once friends,
always friends, but...

15:07.640 --> 15:09.709
Friends look backward.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.244
We only look forward.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.084
"Not a love seat.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.186
-I am not the queen of..."
-(Lucille clears throat)

15:20.954 --> 15:22.589
Now you're spoiling me.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.224
From Mr. Brady.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.127
Hmm. "Dear Margo,

15:27.194 --> 15:30.297
now you can have your cake
and eat it, too."

15:30.363 --> 15:31.698
Manipulative little bastard.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.567
What?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.337
That man would do
anything for you.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.007
And his partner will make
a better actress

15:40.073 --> 15:43.110
out of you, in better pictures.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.913
Nowhere else offers that.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.116
(sighs):
Whew.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.555
You look tired.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.757
I'm fine.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.259
(knock on door)

16:02.329 --> 16:04.631
-MAN: Makeup's ready for you,
Miss Taft. -Oh.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.334
Lucille, will you find
an icebox for the pie

16:07.400 --> 16:09.536
-and take these to wardrobe?
-Yes, ma'am.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.342
(Lucille chuckles)

16:16.576 --> 16:18.678
Ready.

16:18.745 --> 16:19.679
(women laughing)

16:19.746 --> 16:21.748
Yes, I love that.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.189
(women gasping)

16:32.292 --> 16:34.427
-Anyone see what happened?
-No, she just fell.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.428
Did she faint?

16:36.963 --> 16:38.698
I think she might be dead.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.371
(sobbing)

16:46.273 --> 16:48.708
I can leave you alone.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.713
No one even told me.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.715
They put her body in an icebox.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.187
They took her to the morgue
and left me here working,

17:00.253 --> 17:02.522
like I wouldn't want
to be disturbed!

17:05.291 --> 17:07.426
I need to see her again.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.429
(sobbing softly)

17:23.109 --> 17:26.012
She was wonderful.

17:26.079 --> 17:30.317
Kind and... gentle.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.585
-And smart.
-Yes.

17:32.652 --> 17:37.390
And, forgive me
if I'm wrong, but...

17:39.492 --> 17:43.496
...she wasn't your maid,
was she, Margo?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.697
Justyour maid?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.700
Yes. She was my maid.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.537
-She was just... She was just...
-It's okay. It's okay.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.605
-It's safe with me.
-(sobbing)

17:55.275 --> 17:58.611
Tell me about your mother.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
(sniffling)

18:02.682 --> 18:04.351
My mother?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.920
My mother was a lion.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.158
She was a lion, Mr. Stahr.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.360
She gave her whole life to me.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.398
(sniffles)

18:18.465 --> 18:21.134
She was the daughter of a slave.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.439
I am...

18:28.575 --> 18:29.642
(sniffles)

18:29.709 --> 18:33.280
I am the granddaughter
of a slave.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.282
(whispers): But you mustn't
tell anyone that.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.217
No. Of course not.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.851
N-No one. You must promise me.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.553
-Of course not. -You promise me.
It would ruin me.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.222
There would be people
who would be so angered,

18:42.289 --> 18:43.256
they would try to hurt me.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.091
It's a secret.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.227
It stays a secret.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.264
(Margo sniffling)

18:51.331 --> 18:54.133
Look what Lucille made.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.936
In one generation.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.771
-Margo Taft.
-(chuckles)

19:00.607 --> 19:03.276
I mean, isn't that something?

19:03.343 --> 19:04.877
How far she came?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.881
Yes, yes. Maybe.

19:11.384 --> 19:15.522
But her-her entire life,
she was, she was invisible.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.993
None of you ever
looked at her and thought,

19:21.060 --> 19:23.863
"This is Lucille.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.532
"Lucille, who is special,

19:25.598 --> 19:30.203
who is unlike anyone else
who has ever lived."

19:30.270 --> 19:34.241
You just... looked at her like
she was one of the coloreds.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.314
So, yes, she came very far...

19:41.381 --> 19:43.516
and yet nowhere at all.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.291
(music playing quietly
over radio)

19:56.896 --> 19:58.465
-Hello.
-Hallo.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.234
Good evening.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.571
Hi.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.172
-Comfortable?
-Ja.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.173
Good.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.841
(clears throat)

20:08.908 --> 20:10.076
Uh, sorry.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.412
Um...

20:12.479 --> 20:14.447
I wanted to come
visit you all sooner,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.449
but it's been a busy day.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.285
Busier than I expected.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.654
All of this was
planned so suddenly,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.390
there was no way
to secure proper lodging

20:23.456 --> 20:25.124
for so many of you.

20:25.191 --> 20:29.161
But it's only for a few days,
and the food on the lot is good.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.663
(people chuckle)

20:30.730 --> 20:34.334
Anything we can do to make you
feel more at home, we will.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.135
Sleep well.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.037
(people murmur quietly)

20:38.104 --> 20:39.606
Vu iz dos botsimer?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.344
Oh. Uh, it's out the back.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.779
Men's on this side,
women's on the other.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.416
Danke.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.853
(man coughs)

20:56.489 --> 20:58.625
(Hannah speaking
Hebrew quietly)

21:03.696 --> 21:04.997
Kaddish?

21:05.064 --> 21:08.335
For my parents.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.205
When did you lose them?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.675
My father died in the World War.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.878
My mother from the influenza.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.313
I was raised by nuns.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.915
Jewish nuns?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.917
They were very kind.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.720
They raised me
as my parents would have.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.756
How did you know the Kaddish?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.025
-Jewish.
-"Monroe Stahr"?

21:33.092 --> 21:35.428
No. (clears throat)

21:35.495 --> 21:37.564
Born Milton Sternberg.

21:37.630 --> 21:42.034
I know why some of us must,

21:42.101 --> 21:44.837
but what are you hiding from?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.976
Shlof gezunt.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.311
BRADY (voice-over): You shut
down"Her Royal Shyness"?

21:52.379 --> 21:54.747
For one day.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.082
For Margo.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.750
So she can visit the morgue.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.520
You just bought me
an orchestra from Europe.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.490
You have any idea
how much this is gonna cost me?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.057
Because of her maid?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.629
Something you should know.

22:12.632 --> 22:16.102
Wanted to take a moment
for us all to mourn...

22:16.168 --> 22:17.637
as a family.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.542
Pictures are made
by people, after all.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.744
And it is the people who matter.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.783
So while we can't bring back
our beloved Lucille...

22:32.652 --> 22:35.688
...we can remember her.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.357
And what she meant to Margo.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.537
Thank you very much.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.772
Thanks for coming.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.743
(quietly):
I'll remember this.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.618
You are good.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.787
Flowers, jewelry, minks.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.789
Anyone could woo them that way.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.758
But a memorial for a maid.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.961
That's me.
I'm all about closing the deal.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.937
Say, Monroe, you do throw
the greatest parties,

23:25.004 --> 23:27.474
but this one seemed
sort of spur of the moment.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.141
What's the occasion?

23:29.208 --> 23:32.579
It's not just movie stars
who need taking care of, Pat.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.413
See you tonight.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.785
Oh, you poor dear.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.987
We're lost without them,
aren't we?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.054
We are.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.056
I have a wonderful girl,
with a sister.

23:44.123 --> 23:48.160
They're from somewhere
in Georgia, I think.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.830
She will make
your whole house sparkle.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.668
-Thank you.
-Oh.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.570
I mean sparkle, really.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.172
So...

24:13.753 --> 24:15.087
STAHR:
All right.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.589
Take a big breath with me.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.558
(both breathe deeply)

24:18.625 --> 24:20.927
Now, ignore everything
around you.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.562
All the noise.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.498
It's just you and the camera.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.300
You barely have to do a thing,
I promise.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.936
The camera will see it all.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.471
Just your face.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.541
This face.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.009
So be who you are.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.746
-This is not who I am.
-But today it is.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.481
Today you are Adelle
in the world of this scene.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.684
You can do that.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.657
(bell rings)

24:55.862 --> 24:57.730
Soften that light, Charlie.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.901
Max, tilt that top light down.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.208
When you're ready.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.150
(instruments warming up)

25:21.253 --> 25:22.521
Make sure everyone has a drink,

25:22.589 --> 25:25.124
and come find me
if there are any problems.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.926
(knock on door)

25:29.295 --> 25:32.565
Our first guests.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.001
Wait till they see you
on screen.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.302
(chuckles)

25:36.368 --> 25:38.871
You really should let them in.
It is cold outside.

25:43.509 --> 25:46.112
Ah, hello, Virginia.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.414
Darryl, how are you?
Come in out of the cold.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.816
Get yourself a drink.

25:51.450 --> 25:54.220
-(orchestral music playing)
-(lively chatter)

26:01.994 --> 26:04.130
And again. (clears throat)

26:07.667 --> 26:09.802
* *

26:24.851 --> 26:27.787
Do you mind terribly
if I pass up soda pop

26:27.854 --> 26:29.822
and go for the bubbly?

26:29.889 --> 26:31.691
I could use
some anesthesia right now.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.225
Mother and daughter.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.265
Case of the Monroes.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.967
You?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.401
What?

26:42.468 --> 26:43.636
(chuckles):
No.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.338
No, just general ennui.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.244
Parties always make you
feel worse in the end.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.246
I wonder why that is.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.329
Courage.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.864
I'm off to mingle.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.669
* *

27:28.280 --> 27:29.749
KATHLEEN:
It's good to see you.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.251
I'll be right back.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.086
How have you been?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.688
Enjoy the party.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.889
Bye.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.091
What you have is mystery.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.961
What?

27:42.028 --> 27:44.563
-No one knows anything
about you. -(chuckles)

27:44.630 --> 27:47.633
You just popped up.
(chuckles)

27:47.700 --> 27:49.769
-Like most people in this city.
-Mm.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.470
At one point or another.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.705
Like you, I imagine.

27:52.772 --> 27:53.906
Mm.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.808
What is it you'd like to know?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.209
Your secret.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.346
Oh!

28:00.412 --> 28:01.781
Sorry.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.182
Oh, your shoe. Oh, shit.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.984
Don't worry,
I'll get some napkins.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.924
(quietly):
Rose.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.359
(whispering):
What?

28:13.425 --> 28:14.626
What? It was an accident.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.430
You can't blame someone
for an accident.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.932
Why are we whispering?

28:19.999 --> 28:22.701
I don't want to make a scene.

28:22.769 --> 28:23.936
Good idea.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.704
We should go upstairs,
you and me.

28:25.772 --> 28:26.939
We can finish up there.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.708
I'm not going upstairs.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.579
She's lovely.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.681
Do you know
how much that hurts me?

28:35.748 --> 28:37.683
Rose.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.119
What? I miss you all the time.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.156
Don't you ever miss me?

28:46.225 --> 28:48.560
I missed Minna.

28:48.627 --> 28:52.498
You got me through it, and
I will always owe you for that.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.467
Yes, you will.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.972
What are you doing?

29:00.039 --> 29:02.274
-Are you threatening me?
-No.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.710
I'm begging you.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.346
Lots of men have
more than one woman.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.348
Look at my husband.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.151
Why not you?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.122
No secrets, you two.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.523
It's time to rejoin the party.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.525
You're right, Jack.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.160
You are right.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.830
Hey, give us a minute, will you?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.531
WARNER:
Hmm.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.504
I'm sorry I was
the first one of us

29:32.571 --> 29:34.140
-to find happiness.
-(sighs)

29:34.206 --> 29:36.809
Well, I didn't even have
to look; I already had it.

29:36.876 --> 29:40.312
(whispering):
I'm in love, Rose.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.314
What can I do?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.254
-Napkins.
-Thank you.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.490
Thank you.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.993
-You all right?
-Yes.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.707
These parties are insufferable,
aren't they?

30:08.774 --> 30:10.242
Ja.

30:12.111 --> 30:15.247
I much prefer your friend Salka
and the others.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.451
We will go back there again.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.923
Perhaps next week?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.125
I-I'd like that.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.307
What did Salka mean
when she said that I was young,

30:41.373 --> 30:43.642
even for you?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.144
I'm 19, nearly 20.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.812
I'm-I'm not that young.

30:46.879 --> 30:49.681
No.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.884
You're very old.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.723
Are you a virgin?

30:57.789 --> 31:00.526
Of course.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.297
Got a minute, Pat?

31:05.364 --> 31:06.598
Sorry, Bess.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.300
Excuse me.

31:10.536 --> 31:14.106
Uh, I think Rose may be ready
to call it a night.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.977
Oh. Good 'cause I'm doing
wonderfully with Bess.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.446
You don't want to turn
into a clichÃ©, do you?

31:20.512 --> 31:22.648
Depends on what clichÃ©
you're talking about.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.285
He's over there.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.620
All right, time to go to work.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.456
Help me, Pat.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.324
Your wife.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.535
Rose.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.738
Never in public, Pat.

31:46.805 --> 31:49.841
Wasn't that our agreement?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.044
I'll have Henry drive you home.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.084
Do you trust me?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.358
Do you trust me?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.402
Sex isn't sex...

32:16.468 --> 32:19.972
unless it is
a little bit dangerous.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.474
I don't understand.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.144
I will bind your hands
and cover your eyes.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.845
No, I want to be able to see.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.348
Just relinquish control to me.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.550
-But I...
-Don't be upset.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.488
Fetishes are
very natural things.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.490
Oh.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.694
But I'm not like that.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.498
You don't know unless you try.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.267
Just try.

32:50.136 --> 32:53.105
Fear excites me.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.743
Perhaps it will
heighten things for you, too.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.783
What? Stop.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.984
What?

33:06.052 --> 33:07.153
I don't, I don't...

33:07.219 --> 33:09.655
I don't want that.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.692
What?

33:13.759 --> 33:16.595
I-I thought that y-you...

33:16.662 --> 33:18.497
You thought I was what?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.601
Safe? Normal?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.538
Heroic.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.340
(chuckles)

33:30.209 --> 33:33.579
Knocked off my pedestal, am I?

33:33.645 --> 33:36.115
Heroic?

33:36.182 --> 33:37.849
You don't know what that means.

33:37.916 --> 33:41.253
I think I do.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.921
I know what it's not, anyway.

33:42.988 --> 33:48.327
You Americans think people
need to be good to be great.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.529
Goodness is nothing.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.767
There are millions of good,
useless people in the world,

33:55.834 --> 34:00.172
millions of good Germans,
I promise you.

34:00.239 --> 34:04.042
Being brave,
that's what matters.

34:04.110 --> 34:09.114
And brave people can be shits
undperverts, just like me.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.489
* *

34:19.591 --> 34:23.329
A million people read this
in Los Angeles alone.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.996
And that's why we're all here?

34:25.063 --> 34:28.967
What do you want us
to do about it?

34:29.034 --> 34:31.837
Say no.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.739
To Gyssling, to the Germans.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.775
Or at some point, we won't be
answering to our investors,

34:36.842 --> 34:38.510
we'll have to answer to history.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.312
If we create a relief fund,

34:40.379 --> 34:42.648
it's Jew industrialists
running the world.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.949
-Mm-hmm.
-If we make anti-Nazi movies,

34:45.016 --> 34:46.418
it's Jewish propaganda.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.754
Either way, we're playing
into the hands of the enemy.

34:48.820 --> 34:53.925
That's a little easy,
don't you think, L.B.?

34:53.992 --> 34:55.860
You're not a Jew, Pat.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.331
So...

34:59.398 --> 35:02.168
we're suggesting
I take on Germany?

35:02.234 --> 35:04.270
Just me, hmm?

35:04.336 --> 35:06.538
Lose all that revenue

35:06.605 --> 35:09.708
with no thanks from you
but a-a pat on the back.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.144
Well, thanks, anyway.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.845
And screw all of you.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.847
(chuckles)

35:15.914 --> 35:18.317
History doesn't pay my salary.

35:18.384 --> 35:21.687
On the other hand,
we all-- all--

35:21.753 --> 35:25.557
have stockholders
that we have to answer to.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.393
Monroe, lovely party.
Thank you very much.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.600
* *

35:44.643 --> 35:48.747
I'd be happy to offer myself
as your private tour guide.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.050
We leave for Vienna
tomorrow afternoon.

35:52.117 --> 35:55.421
What, you do?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.155
I didn't realize it.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.725
Yes.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.861
So, what would be the point
of getting attached?

36:02.928 --> 36:07.599
Getting attached is
the only point, if you ask me.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.407
How did it go?

36:17.676 --> 36:20.412
(sighs)

36:20.479 --> 36:22.614
Maybe no one saves anyone.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.522
Well, that didn't take long.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.625
Oh, Monroe wanted
to talk about Germany.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.327
Bad timing.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.963
There's still a depression.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.966
Didn't you have your fill
of that at the party?

36:44.002 --> 36:46.405
You know, I had
the perfect moment with Mayer

36:46.472 --> 36:49.007
as we were walking out...
(chuckles)

36:49.074 --> 36:51.443
...about Margo Taft.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.913
Left him speechless.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.449
Tell it to Bess Burrows.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.785
I'm not interested.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.787
No?

37:04.956 --> 37:08.694
You and Mayer
humiliate your wives.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.863
You fuck the women
who work for you,

37:11.930 --> 37:16.402
and pretend they want you,
and then cower to the Nazis.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.938
(laughs):
Then you argue with each other

37:20.005 --> 37:23.342
about who's the bigger man.

37:23.409 --> 37:26.478
Spare me.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.415
Is that really
what you think of me?

37:33.552 --> 37:35.821
Isn't that who you are, Pat?

37:51.236 --> 37:52.771
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

37:52.838 --> 37:56.408
Can I have a moment
of your time?

37:56.475 --> 38:02.280
Uh, I want to thank you
for coming all this way,

38:02.348 --> 38:05.283
for your wonderful work
on our movie.

38:06.985 --> 38:12.090
You're all going home tomorrow,
and I know that it's a trip

38:12.157 --> 38:15.761
back to a continent that is
full of risks for some of you.

38:18.430 --> 38:22.534
I want to offer an alternative
to as many as are amenable.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.537
It's the reason I brought
you here in the first place,

38:25.604 --> 38:28.740
not because I couldn't find
musicians in Los Angeles,

38:28.807 --> 38:30.909
but because I'm afraid
of where Europe is heading.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.816
I hired you
so that I can help you.

38:37.883 --> 38:41.252
Stay here with us.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.088
Don't go back.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.090
We'll find work for you,

38:45.156 --> 38:48.860
places to live for all of you,
if you're willing.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.664
But, Mr. Stahr,

38:52.731 --> 38:56.735
many of us have families.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.071
I have a wife and three
children, young children,

39:00.138 --> 39:01.573
in Vienna.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.576
I know these are
all difficult choices.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.478
Perhaps they can come, too.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.013
We'll find a way.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.483
But if you don't?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.018
If you cannot?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.389
I understand.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.425
Think about it, at least.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.612
We only make movies, huh?

39:48.920 --> 39:52.057
(violin playing "Violin Concerto
in E minor, Op. 64")

40:05.604 --> 40:07.739
* *

40:19.250 --> 40:20.952
You are here late.

40:21.019 --> 40:24.590
I had to watch
the cut of a picture.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.425
There was nothing
objectionable about it,

40:27.493 --> 40:29.728
except maybe the length.

40:32.631 --> 40:36.201
Mendelssohn was a Jew, no?

40:38.403 --> 40:39.971
He was.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.542
Play it again.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.681
That passage always
makes me weep.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.693
* *

41:23.615 --> 41:25.751
* *

41:35.026 --> 41:36.962
BRADY (voice-over):
I've had as many surprises

41:37.028 --> 41:39.164
as I can take
in one week, Monroe.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.766
What's this all about?

41:40.832 --> 41:43.101
Is this about last night?
About the musicians?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.370
Just watch. And don't worry
about the accent.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.705
Odelle will take care of that.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.440
Just... look at the face.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.010
Roll it, Pete.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.979
(sighs)

41:55.847 --> 41:57.583
(projector clicking)

42:01.953 --> 42:04.856
You have to listen to me.

42:04.923 --> 42:09.027
He's not who he says he is.

42:09.094 --> 42:13.231
The professor and his friends,
none of them are.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.433
It's all a terrible act.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.302
We're in danger.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.437
We're in great danger.

42:19.504 --> 42:22.407
Please, say you believe me.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.910
-(whispers): Monroe.
-I know.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.077
KATHLEEN:
I lost a job because of it.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.847
But this time, I swear,
it's all true.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.616
The clattering sound you hear

42:30.682 --> 42:32.350
is the click of
typewriter keys on paper.

42:32.417 --> 42:36.087
This building is where
Brady-American writers come

42:36.154 --> 42:39.858
to turn real life
into fantasy, and fantasy...

42:52.838 --> 42:55.707
I'm here on a condolence call
for Margo.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.777
-Aw.
-(Mayer chuckles)

42:58.844 --> 43:00.178
I don't believe you.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.546
(Mayer chuckles)

43:01.613 --> 43:04.950
Well, maybe not just that.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.786
Uh, there is a small problem.

43:07.853 --> 43:12.357
But I'm sure that
if we put our heads together...

43:12.423 --> 43:14.492
What is it, L.B.?

43:14.559 --> 43:16.461
Well, it turns out
Louella Parsons

43:16.527 --> 43:21.232
has gotten ahold of a story--
a very damaging story--

43:21.299 --> 43:25.637
about Margo and her maid.

43:27.038 --> 43:31.042
It's a career-altering story,
I would say.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.844
From whom?

43:32.911 --> 43:35.113
Uh, Louella never tells.

43:35.180 --> 43:39.851
Somebody from long ago
who became indiscreet

43:39.918 --> 43:42.754
after the woman died.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.924
Is it true?

43:46.792 --> 43:48.293
Is it true?

43:48.359 --> 43:49.360
Don't ask her that.

43:51.496 --> 43:53.832
Fine.

43:53.899 --> 43:56.134
Just that
Louella wants to publish.

43:56.201 --> 43:58.870
(chuckles):
And you know Louella.

43:58.937 --> 44:02.073
Luckily, I have a particular
relationship with her.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.110
The one person who could
convince her not to.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.748
(sighs) Thank you, L.B.

44:09.815 --> 44:11.049
Thank you, L.B.

44:12.951 --> 44:15.653
Oh, that's not
how you thank me, Pat.

44:17.022 --> 44:18.790
If you've already
drafted your agreement,

44:18.857 --> 44:20.291
will you send it
to my legal department?

44:20.358 --> 44:22.293
It'll save my lawyers
some trouble.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.695
Son of a bitch.

44:23.762 --> 44:26.031
MAYER:
I will expect you

44:26.097 --> 44:28.934
on the MGM lot
once you've wrapped "Shyness."

44:36.107 --> 44:37.375
Margo?

44:54.993 --> 44:56.928
What if I just say no?

44:56.995 --> 44:59.464
The hell with him. I am sick
and tired of being afraid.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.966
Let him do what he's gonna do.

45:08.807 --> 45:12.077
I have a better idea.

45:12.143 --> 45:14.746
You go be the biggest star
in the world.

45:14.813 --> 45:16.247
Show 'em all.

45:24.522 --> 45:27.959
(softly):
Right. Yes.

45:30.628 --> 45:32.798
We still have "Shyness."

45:34.499 --> 45:37.402
We'll make a good picture
with that one.

45:37.468 --> 45:38.603
Fuck Louie Mayer.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.705
Fuck Louie Mayer. (laughs)

45:40.772 --> 45:43.108
And Louella Parsons.

45:43.174 --> 45:46.444
Nobody can hold a candle to you.

45:46.511 --> 45:48.379
(sighs)

45:51.149 --> 45:53.885
You know what's funny
about you, Pat?

45:55.553 --> 45:58.156
Everyone in this business
has two faces.

45:59.624 --> 46:02.427
Most people, they put
their best one forward

46:02.493 --> 46:04.495
and they hide their worst.

46:06.364 --> 46:09.968
But you, you put on
a gruff face...

46:10.035 --> 46:11.870
and you hide your heart.

46:14.139 --> 46:17.075
-It'll have to be our secret.
-(chuckles)

46:22.780 --> 46:23.748
(sighs)

46:23.815 --> 46:25.951
Thank you.

46:28.253 --> 46:30.188
* *

46:45.070 --> 46:47.072
How many are staying?

46:48.940 --> 46:50.275
I don't know.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.277
No one speaks of it out loud.

46:52.343 --> 46:54.379
How about you?

46:54.445 --> 46:55.546
Are you staying?

47:01.819 --> 47:04.722
Look, home isn't
so safe anymore.

47:04.789 --> 47:07.258
-We all understand that.
-Okay, then.

47:07.325 --> 47:10.561
But it is home, and this is not.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.933
After my parents died,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.102
my nightmares were
of being all alone.

47:19.070 --> 47:21.306
Not all of us will find someone.

47:29.214 --> 47:32.884
Being attached is
the only thing that matters.

47:32.951 --> 47:36.187
Or so I've been told.

47:39.925 --> 47:42.060
* *

47:57.508 --> 47:59.444
Am I mistaken,

47:59.510 --> 48:01.446
or does it seem
that there are fewer members

48:01.512 --> 48:05.350
of the orchestra now
than when they first arrived?

48:05.416 --> 48:08.653
Is that so?
I wasn't counting.

48:19.630 --> 48:21.899
Leo. What are you doing?

48:21.967 --> 48:23.668
I'm getting on my bus, Georg.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.303
Don't.

48:25.370 --> 48:27.872
Don't get on the bus, Leo.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.240
I'm going home.

48:29.307 --> 48:32.978
We both know how cold
it can be in Vienna.

48:34.712 --> 48:37.915
Some time in the ocean air
might do you good.

48:39.584 --> 48:43.654
There's no rush to get home,
old friend.

48:43.721 --> 48:47.192
My life is there.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.060
Mein ganzes leben.

48:49.127 --> 48:52.230
Leo, you're not hearing.

48:53.531 --> 48:56.934
I am no different
from other Jews.

48:57.002 --> 49:00.105
You just know me.

49:07.478 --> 49:09.647
(engine starts)

49:09.714 --> 49:11.649
* *

49:29.767 --> 49:30.968
I'll see you next week.

49:31.036 --> 49:33.371
Uh, Mr. Dummit, um...

49:33.438 --> 49:35.573
I was wondering if maybe
we could borrow

49:35.640 --> 49:37.242
just a little bit more.

49:37.308 --> 49:40.011
There are some
unexpected expenses.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.712
Clapboard?

49:41.779 --> 49:43.081
Photography.

49:43.148 --> 49:45.616
DUMMIT:
Your choice.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.818
A good client like you.
Come by my office tomorrow.

49:47.885 --> 49:49.454
Okay.

49:50.555 --> 49:51.389
Okay.

49:52.257 --> 49:54.225
Who was that?

49:56.427 --> 49:59.064
What are you doing here?
(chuckles)

49:59.130 --> 50:01.066
And don't say you were
in the neighborhood.

50:01.132 --> 50:04.802
No. I made a special trip.

50:04.869 --> 50:07.638
Is that "absolutely not
a date" offer still good?

50:07.705 --> 50:11.276
So, none of the better options
panned out, huh?

50:11.342 --> 50:12.943
Exactly.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.513
Come in, come in.

50:19.984 --> 50:21.719
Yeah, the, uh, place still needs

50:21.786 --> 50:23.654
a bit of work to be done,
you know.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.957
No. It's wonderful.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.626
You've made a home.

50:30.361 --> 50:33.064
This is, uh, uh,
my sister Darla.

50:33.131 --> 50:34.265
This is my brother Nathan.

50:34.332 --> 50:36.534
This is, this is Celia.

50:36.601 --> 50:40.838
Do you like, uh, do you like
bread and, uh, and soup?

50:40.905 --> 50:42.140
I love them.

50:42.207 --> 50:45.910
Great, okay.
Well, uh, yeah, sit here.

50:45.976 --> 50:48.546
Okay.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.648
Let's see here.

50:54.752 --> 50:56.421
Oop, I took yours.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.656
-(chuckles)
-Okay, yeah, thank you.

51:00.758 --> 51:02.427
Dig in.

51:03.628 --> 51:04.795
How is it?

51:04.862 --> 51:07.498
CELIA:
It's really good.

51:07.565 --> 51:10.168
It's the best meal
I've ever had.

51:28.153 --> 51:30.121
I was born around
the corner from here.

51:32.123 --> 51:37.362
We lived on Hester, until
my father moved us to the Bronx.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.198
Took him seven years
to save up enough to do that.

51:42.167 --> 51:44.269
A candle?

51:44.335 --> 51:46.504
That's for him.

51:46.571 --> 51:49.440
It's a thing Jewish people
do for the dead.

51:51.309 --> 51:53.444
I haven't lit one
in a long time.

51:58.549 --> 52:01.619
(sighs) You've never
talked about him.

52:01.686 --> 52:02.720
Your father.

52:02.787 --> 52:04.121
Mm. Mm.

52:04.189 --> 52:05.856
(sighs)

52:08.826 --> 52:11.896
Morris Sternberg.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.499
The man whose name I discarded.

52:18.068 --> 52:20.305
He made shirt collars.

52:20.371 --> 52:22.507
He was a collar man.

52:23.841 --> 52:27.312
We didn't have much
to say to each other.

52:27.378 --> 52:30.381
He didn't have much
to say to anyone.

52:33.083 --> 52:36.721
I don't think anything I did
ever made him happy.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.891
Why all this now?

52:40.958 --> 52:43.093
(sighs)

52:43.160 --> 52:46.731
These... these musicians

52:46.797 --> 52:50.067
and... Hannah Taub.

52:50.134 --> 52:52.870
Margo Taft.

52:52.937 --> 52:56.241
We've all traveled
a long way to get here.

52:58.108 --> 52:59.877
I ran away.

53:02.112 --> 53:04.415
But home comes with you.

53:06.284 --> 53:09.354
I'm the son of a shirtmaker.

53:09.420 --> 53:12.590
The grandson of peasants
from outside Kiev.

53:12.657 --> 53:14.525
Still.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.294
Always.

53:20.798 --> 53:25.236
You asked me if I could
love the tour guide.

53:25.303 --> 53:26.937
I love Kathleen Moore.

53:28.606 --> 53:31.742
The girl from Rathgar.

53:31.809 --> 53:35.513
I love the you that's you
wherever you go

53:35.580 --> 53:38.549
and whatever you do.

53:38.616 --> 53:40.985
But I still want things
to change for you.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.855
That's why people come here.

53:46.957 --> 53:49.327
It always has been.

53:49.394 --> 53:51.529
* *

53:54.098 --> 53:57.234
(softly):
Yeah.

53:57.302 --> 53:59.437
That's why I came.

54:01.306 --> 54:04.475
* Oh, every time it rains *

54:04.542 --> 54:09.347
* It rains pennies
from heaven... *

54:11.215 --> 54:13.551
Oh, you've done this before.

54:13.618 --> 54:17.422
Things were good in Vienna
before they were bad, you know.

54:17.488 --> 54:21.225
So now I am your project?

54:21.292 --> 54:24.695
I... well, I...
feel responsible.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.197
We brought you out of
the darkness of Europe,

54:27.264 --> 54:30.000
and I want this place to be...

54:30.067 --> 54:32.537
better for you.

54:32.603 --> 54:36.674
Well, in my experience,

54:36.741 --> 54:41.011
we bring the darkness
with us, Mr. Hackett.

54:41.078 --> 54:44.048
* Sunshine and flowers *

54:46.016 --> 54:50.488
* If you want
the things you love *

54:50.555 --> 54:54.892
* You must have showers... *

54:54.959 --> 54:56.894
* *

55:10.775 --> 55:12.710
* *

55:28.826 --> 55:30.094
Rose.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.899
I'm very sorry.

55:42.507 --> 55:45.643
(Stahr praying in Hebrew)

55:50.314 --> 55:52.049
Amen.

55:52.116 --> 55:55.453
(cello playing "Violin Concerto
in E minor, Op. 64")
