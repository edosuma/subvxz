00:12.984 --> 00:14.951
I'm still not
comfortable with this.

00:14.953 --> 00:16.058
Steve,

00:16.059 --> 00:18.059
everyone on this rock
knows you and Five-O.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.360
So if you guys show up,

00:19.362 --> 00:21.129
the clientele's gonna be
out the back door

00:21.131 --> 00:23.131
before you even step foot
in the front,

00:23.133 --> 00:25.133
but they don't know me.

00:25.135 --> 00:27.569
Maybe we do a different location.
No, no, no.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.938
This guys doesn't want anyone
to know that he's in the casino,

00:29.940 --> 00:31.806
So it's the only place where
he's not gonna have security

00:31.808 --> 00:33.107
with him.

00:33.109 --> 00:34.943
I've surveilled it;
I know how to get in,

00:34.945 --> 00:36.778
I know how to get out. Boom.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.247
What if you get compromised?

00:39.249 --> 00:40.315
I'll improvise.

00:40.317 --> 00:41.883
You're the one who told me

00:41.885 --> 00:43.484
to get back
up on the horse, okay?

00:43.486 --> 00:44.686
And you were right.

00:44.688 --> 00:47.155
So you're just gonna have
to let me do this.

00:57.533 --> 00:59.100
What, are you deputizing me?

00:59.102 --> 01:01.269
Just in case, all right?

01:01.271 --> 01:02.437
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

01:02.439 --> 01:04.438
I've got this covered, okay?

01:07.076 --> 01:09.577
It's gonna be fine.

01:25.728 --> 01:27.228
Six, pass line wins.

01:38.073 --> 01:40.041
Betting against the table

01:40.043 --> 01:41.943
hasn't been working
for you, huh?

01:42.778 --> 01:45.747
Maybe you can get lucky
some other way.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.311
Haven't we met before, miss?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.782
What do you want?

02:20.784 --> 02:23.117
Riku Sato, where is he?

03:27.282 --> 03:29.050
Who the hell are you?

03:29.052 --> 03:31.285
Five-O.

03:31.287 --> 03:32.620
Now where the hell

03:32.622 --> 03:34.422
is Sato?

Thanks, Nani.
Sure.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.492
What's that for?

05:52.494 --> 05:54.861
Well, Captain Grover, let's just
say I've been around long enough

05:54.863 --> 05:56.797
to know that when someone
pays for your meal

05:56.799 --> 05:58.098
they usually want something.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.300
Come on.

06:00.302 --> 06:01.501
Are you really that cynical?

06:01.503 --> 06:03.837
Where I'm from,
cops do that for each other.

06:03.839 --> 06:06.006
Besides, I figured it was
the least I could do

06:06.008 --> 06:08.108
after pointing a shotgun
in your face.

06:08.110 --> 06:10.877
Yeah, well, that hostage crisis
was rough on everyone.

06:10.879 --> 06:12.078
I think it's fair to say

06:12.080 --> 06:13.847
that there was fault
on both sides.

06:13.849 --> 06:16.683
Lieutenant,

06:16.685 --> 06:19.986
I realize the governor
gives you guys a free pass,

06:19.988 --> 06:21.555
but to be honest,

06:21.557 --> 06:24.324
that behavior I saw out there
in the field the other day,

06:24.326 --> 06:26.660
that's a surefire way
to get yourself alienated

06:26.662 --> 06:27.994
from your brothers in blue.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.729
I mean,

06:29.731 --> 06:31.398
I'd hate to see you
in a situation

06:31.400 --> 06:34.801
where you call for backup
and it doesn't show.

06:34.803 --> 06:36.236
I think you need to be having

06:36.238 --> 06:38.104
this conversation
with McGarrett.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.639
I don't think so.

06:39.641 --> 06:41.174
I'm not having this conversation
with McGarrett.

06:41.176 --> 06:42.475
McGarrett's not a real cop.

06:42.477 --> 06:43.910
He doesn't think like a cop,

06:43.912 --> 06:45.178
he doesn't act like a cop.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.680
You, on the other hand...

06:46.682 --> 06:49.049
I did my homework;
you're a good cop.

06:49.051 --> 06:50.817
Got your badge back after going
through a rough patch.

06:50.819 --> 06:53.153
I know what that's like.

06:53.988 --> 06:56.156
Have a nice day, Captain.

07:03.899 --> 07:06.566
I'm coming, I'm coming.

07:06.568 --> 07:08.034
I said I'm coming!

07:08.036 --> 07:09.469
All right, all right.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.918
Mary, what...

07:24.920 --> 07:26.853
You should see your face.

07:26.855 --> 07:28.455
What are you doing here?

07:28.457 --> 07:30.323
Who's baby is this?

07:30.325 --> 07:31.858
Mine.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.894
No, it's not.

07:33.896 --> 07:35.028
She's mine.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.763
I adopted her.
What are you talking about?

07:36.765 --> 07:38.331
How could it be yours?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.599
It's been in the works
for a while,

07:39.601 --> 07:41.067
but I kept in on the DL
in case

07:41.069 --> 07:43.303
a certain someone
was gonna be critical about it.

07:43.305 --> 07:44.905
I don't believe it.

07:44.907 --> 07:45.872
Isn't she cute?

07:45.874 --> 07:46.940
I named her

07:46.942 --> 07:48.341
after Dad.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.610
Oh, you named her John?
No, Joan.

07:50.612 --> 07:52.445
Mary, I don't want
to be critical,

07:52.447 --> 07:55.782
but you have difficulty
managing your own life.

07:55.784 --> 07:57.150
How you gonna look
after the baby?

07:57.152 --> 07:58.919
I think I took care
of a 90-year-old man

07:58.921 --> 08:00.120
pretty well.

08:00.122 --> 08:01.421
For three weeks, and he died.

08:01.423 --> 08:03.123
He died of natural causes, okay?

08:03.125 --> 08:05.425
Okay.

08:05.427 --> 08:07.160
You got to give her back, Mary.

08:07.162 --> 08:08.695
Steve, I can't return her

08:08.697 --> 08:10.864
like she's an Xbox.
She's not an Xbox.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.265
She's a little
baby person, okay,

08:12.267 --> 08:13.767
and this is a responsibility

08:13.769 --> 08:15.568
you're gonna have for the rest
of your life.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.504
You're really killing my buzz
being a new mom.

08:17.506 --> 08:18.738
Thanks.

08:20.809 --> 08:22.342
Yeah? Okay.

08:22.344 --> 08:23.710
I'm on the way.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.478
I got to go.
All right, listen,

08:25.480 --> 08:28.281
we'll talk about this
when I get back.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.753
Bye.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.289
Buddy, listen to me,
the way I see it,

08:37.292 --> 08:39.458
Mary didn't adopt a kid;
you did.

08:39.461 --> 08:41.561
All right, 'cause it's only
a matter of time

08:41.563 --> 08:42.962
before that poor,
unfortunate child

08:42.965 --> 08:44.831
is looking for some suckling
at 3:00 a.m.,

08:44.833 --> 08:46.166
is gonna be
looking to you.

08:46.168 --> 08:47.934
No, there's gonna be
no suckling, okay? - No?

08:47.936 --> 08:49.235
'Cause that baby is going back.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.371
Oh, you're gonna send it
back, what, to the orphanage?

08:51.373 --> 08:53.406
With a bunch of other kids
that nobody wants?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.674
What?
Yeah, no, it's a good idea.

08:54.676 --> 08:55.942
I mean, it's probably
a better idea

08:55.944 --> 08:57.143
than leaving it
with your sister.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.411
Wait a minute, I thought
you didn't approve?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.512
I don't approve.

08:59.514 --> 09:01.348
Okay, whose side
are you on then?

09:01.350 --> 09:03.283
I'm on the side where the kid
has a chance of being loved.

09:03.285 --> 09:04.851
If you think Mary
is capable of doing that,

09:04.853 --> 09:06.586
then I'm all for it, okay?

09:06.588 --> 09:09.456
Gentlemen, what we have
here is a male victim.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.291
C.O.D. is quite evident

09:11.293 --> 09:13.660
based on the multiple
stab wounds.

09:13.662 --> 09:15.161
He was most likely attacked

09:15.163 --> 09:16.296
in the water.

09:16.298 --> 09:18.531
Maybe a couple of guys
got territorial

09:18.533 --> 09:20.767
over this break,
and then it got out of hand.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.868
A reasonable theory,

09:21.870 --> 09:23.436
but highly unlikely.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.771
The victim's hands

09:24.773 --> 09:26.773
are noticeably free
of defensive wounds,

09:26.775 --> 09:29.042
which suggests
that the attack was sudden

09:29.044 --> 09:30.210
and unexpected.

09:30.212 --> 09:32.112
Okay, do we get an ID?

09:32.114 --> 09:33.446
I was just getting to that.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.182
Just spoke to a lifeguard
who patrols this area.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.584
He said our vic's a regular,

09:37.586 --> 09:39.986
here every Monday 9:00 a.m.,
swell or no swell.

09:39.988 --> 09:41.688
Okay, so predictable schedule,

09:41.690 --> 09:43.089
he's hit up close and personal,

09:43.091 --> 09:44.924
no defensive wounds.

09:44.926 --> 09:46.159
Our victim
could've been attacked

09:46.161 --> 09:47.394
by somebody who knew him.

09:47.396 --> 09:49.562
Our victim has been identified

09:49.564 --> 09:51.331
as Bryan Carpenter.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.536
Pinches for assault,
drug charges,

09:56.538 --> 09:59.539
grand larceny, guy's been in
and out of trouble for years.

09:59.541 --> 10:01.641
Looks like his troubles
followed him out to sea.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.979
Got signs of a break-in.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.148
Place has been tossed.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.856
Clear.

10:18.025 --> 10:20.360
I wonder if they found
what they were looking for.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.774
What is that?

10:34.776 --> 10:37.911
Something under this drain.

10:47.321 --> 10:49.422
This could be what
they were looking for.

10:49.424 --> 10:52.759
There's something else
in there.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.733
Oh, my God.
Chin, what is it?

11:00.735 --> 11:05.205
Our victim
wasn't Bryan Carpenter.

11:16.016 --> 11:18.551
<i>His name is Matt Hutchins.</i>

11:18.553 --> 11:21.521
<i>He was a cadet at the Police</i>
<i>Academy when I was teaching</i>

11:21.523 --> 11:24.424
a class on executing
search warrants a few years ago.

11:24.426 --> 11:26.392
Normally, I don't remember
students,

11:26.394 --> 11:29.295
but Matt asked a lot
of really smart questions.

11:29.297 --> 11:33.066
<i>One day, he cornered me</i>
<i>after class</i>

11:33.068 --> 11:35.468
<i>and asked me what</i>
<i>the job was really like.</i>

11:35.470 --> 11:37.403
<i>The kid wanted</i>
<i>to make a difference,</i>

11:37.405 --> 11:39.672
<i>but wasn't even sure</i>
<i>it was possible.</i>

11:39.674 --> 11:41.875
He grew up
in a rough neighborhood,

11:41.877 --> 11:43.810
drug dealing, gangs.

11:43.812 --> 11:46.312
<i>When I asked him,</i>
<i>"Why be a cop?"</i>

11:46.314 --> 11:49.549
he said that "The game"
was the only thing he knew,

11:49.551 --> 11:52.886
and that he would end up
on one side of it or the other.

11:52.888 --> 11:55.955
He wanted
to take the right path.

11:55.957 --> 11:58.124
So he became a cop.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.660
Well, Matt never got
his badge.

12:00.662 --> 12:02.395
He was busted
for heroin possession.

12:02.397 --> 12:03.963
He got kicked out
of the Academy.

12:03.965 --> 12:05.899
I was disappointed.

12:05.901 --> 12:08.301
Special Agent
Blake Kennedy, ATF.

12:08.303 --> 12:10.670
I just got a call?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.774
What happened to my guy?

12:15.543 --> 12:17.210
Sorry. Your guy?

12:17.212 --> 12:21.581
Matt, uh, Hutchins was working a
long-term undercover op for ATF.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.649
I was his handler.

12:22.651 --> 12:25.552
So he was never kicked out
of the Academy.

12:25.554 --> 12:28.321
Kicked out? Hell no.
That was all part of his cover.

12:28.323 --> 12:29.422
What was the op?

12:29.424 --> 12:31.124
We had him infiltrate
a gang of gunrunners.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.127
A network with ties to
Asia and the mainland.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.229
Matt's job was to ID
the players

12:36.231 --> 12:38.097
and record transactions,
and we were just about

12:38.099 --> 12:40.233
to drop the net
on these guys.

12:40.235 --> 12:43.171
Another few weeks
and Matt would've a career bust.

12:43.172 --> 12:46.106
If you guys were that close,
we have to assume one thing...

12:46.107 --> 12:49.142
Matt's cover was compromised.

13:02.770 --> 13:04.304
How?

13:04.306 --> 13:06.406
He was attacked
this morning.

13:06.408 --> 13:09.276
We believe
he was deliberately targeted.

13:10.345 --> 13:11.678
Where?

13:11.680 --> 13:13.447
Baby Makapu'u Beach.

13:16.251 --> 13:18.252
We were just there today.

13:18.254 --> 13:21.622
A witness told us that he surfed
there every Monday.

13:22.857 --> 13:25.826
My son and I go there
every Monday.

13:28.062 --> 13:30.197
Well, he couldn't break cover,

13:30.199 --> 13:33.600
but I'm sure that was his way
of keeping an eye on you.

13:33.602 --> 13:36.937
Do you know who did this?

13:36.939 --> 13:39.039
We believe it had
something to do

13:39.041 --> 13:41.375
with his undercover
assignment.

13:43.878 --> 13:47.681
Those people he was
investigating, he hated them.

13:47.683 --> 13:49.583
How often did you two speak?

13:49.585 --> 13:50.717
Every few weeks.

13:50.719 --> 13:53.253
A text here,
a quick phone call there.

13:53.255 --> 13:54.821
Always from a different number.

13:54.823 --> 13:56.623
But the last time,

13:56.625 --> 13:58.525
his tone was different...

13:58.527 --> 14:00.260
How so?

14:00.262 --> 14:01.528
I don't know.

14:01.530 --> 14:04.364
He sounded happy.

14:07.335 --> 14:08.535
So I was under the impression

14:08.537 --> 14:10.470
that maybe it was coming
all coming

14:10.472 --> 14:12.339
to an end and...

14:13.808 --> 14:16.710
he'd be home soon.

14:16.712 --> 14:21.048
My husband sacrificed
everything for that job.

14:21.050 --> 14:24.851
Lieutenant, you need to find
the bastards who did this.

14:26.321 --> 14:29.323
This is the guy we're after,
J.C. Dekker.

14:29.325 --> 14:31.658
He spent his wayward youth on
the North Shore making a name

14:31.660 --> 14:32.893
for himself in the ice trade.

14:32.895 --> 14:35.529
Now, ten years ago, he moved
his operation into town

14:35.531 --> 14:37.397
and he upgraded his clientele,

14:37.399 --> 14:40.100
focusing primarily on weapons
distribution.

14:40.102 --> 14:42.669
Guys right below him have been
there since the first dollar.

14:42.671 --> 14:44.338
Everyone else has been
recruited along the way.

14:44.340 --> 14:47.040
Looks like Matt worked his way
up the chain of command.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.642
Well, like I said:
That was Matt's talent.

14:48.644 --> 14:50.244
He was able
to talk the talk,

14:50.246 --> 14:51.778
and that earned him respect.

14:51.780 --> 14:52.980
And when it came time,

14:52.982 --> 14:54.514
he wasn't afraid
to use some muscle.

14:54.516 --> 14:57.050
When I first sent him in,
we didn't know what to expect.

14:57.052 --> 14:59.753
We thought it
was a six-month op at most.

14:59.755 --> 15:01.255
But Matt's intel was so good,

15:01.257 --> 15:04.091
we soon realized we were sitting
on a major case.

15:04.093 --> 15:05.158
Right, now that Matt's gone,

15:05.160 --> 15:07.094
so are the chances
of taking these guys out.

15:07.096 --> 15:08.962
That's why
I like Dekker for this.

15:08.964 --> 15:10.575
Motive, means, opportunity.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.477
What about these guys?
What happened to them?

15:13.479 --> 15:14.778
KIA.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.581
As tight as Dekker's operation
is, he has his problems.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.351
In the last few months,
these dirtbags have been robbed

15:20.353 --> 15:23.287
a number of times by a
three-man crew we have yet to identify.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.556
How were these robberies
going down?

15:25.558 --> 15:27.625
It wasn't any street-level,
crime-of-opportunity stuff.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.193
I mean, we're talking
well-coordinated hit-and-runs.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.995
Cash drops,
they were there.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.830
Guns in storage,
they were there.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.766
All right, well, maybe Dekker thought
Matt was selling 'em out.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.402
Giving information to the guys
who were ripping off his boys.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.170
Or maybe Dekker figured out
Matt was a cop.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.939
I mean, either way, Dekker had

15:41.941 --> 15:44.775
at least two motives
to kill this kid.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.810
We're gonna need everything
on this case. - Yeah.

15:46.812 --> 15:48.379
Linda, can you come

15:48.381 --> 15:49.880
over here for a moment?

15:51.149 --> 15:53.550
Linda Davies, this is Steve McGarrett,
Detective Danny Williams.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.919
Hi. - Hi.
Hi.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.086
They're with Five-O.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.422
Now, Linda transcribed
all of Matt's reports.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.391
She'll get you everything
you need.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.060
Of course. Right this way.

16:05.697 --> 16:06.797
This is everything.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.099
Ms. Davies, do you mind
if we ask you

16:09.101 --> 16:10.901
how well did
you know Matt?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.903
We actually never met.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.406
I've listened to his voice
for the past four years.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.775
I transcribed every one
of his reports.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.944
So I could tell
when he was having

16:19.946 --> 16:22.279
a good week and
when, when it was bad.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.648
How did he sound
in his last few reports?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.150
Anything unusual?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.885
Did he mention any threats?

16:27.887 --> 16:31.021
If you're asking me if his cover
was blown, I can tell you this:

16:31.023 --> 16:33.791
the longer you leave
an undercover out there,

16:33.793 --> 16:35.592
they get tired and depressed,

16:35.594 --> 16:38.562
sloppy. They start
making mistakes.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.632
It's not my place to say this,
but I, I really think

16:41.634 --> 16:44.168
we had enough to take these guys
down months ago.

16:44.869 --> 16:46.670
What makes you say that?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.839
I've been working this job
for a while now,

16:48.841 --> 16:51.375
and I've seen this department
take people down for much less.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.510
If we would have done
what we normally do,

16:53.512 --> 16:59.416
I-I just can't help but wonder
if Matt would still be alive.

17:02.687 --> 17:06.357
All right, are you gonna say it
or am I?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.891
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not ready

17:07.893 --> 17:09.893
to start pointing fingers.
Okay, I'll say it.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.396
If the ATF could have
made an arrest months ago,

17:12.397 --> 17:13.430
why didn't they?

17:13.432 --> 17:15.031
Keeping Matt out there
past his sell-by date

17:15.034 --> 17:16.700
could have compromised
his cover.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.102
Dismantling an operation
like this,

17:18.104 --> 17:19.869
it is not as easy
as it sounds.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.338
Think about Matt, all right?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.707
This guy, maybe he, uh,
maybe he got tired,

17:23.709 --> 17:26.109
maybe he missed his family,
maybe somewhere he slipped up.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.146
Maybe he slipped up,
and maybe Kennedy kept Matt

17:29.148 --> 17:30.748
out there too long
because he cared more

17:30.750 --> 17:33.350
about making his case than
he did about looking after his boy.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.452
Maybe, but like I said, I am not
ready for pointing fingers

17:35.454 --> 17:37.755
until we have something
that is real, okay?

17:37.757 --> 17:38.856
I'll tell you what's real:

17:38.858 --> 17:41.158
J.C. Dekker. And let me tell you
something else.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.793
If he suspected for one second

17:42.795 --> 17:46.196
that Matt was a cop,
he would take care of business.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.498
I agree.
But to go rattle

17:47.500 --> 17:49.333
that cage right now
is a terrible idea

17:49.335 --> 17:51.735
because we could blow the ATF's
entire three-year operation.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.137
So we'll tread lightly.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.005
Got your attention now
or what?!

17:55.007 --> 17:57.541
Hey, hey, hey, what happened to
"tread lightly," huh?

17:57.543 --> 17:59.610
I'm giving you three seconds to
get your hands off my throat.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.311
Or what?

18:01.313 --> 18:03.547
How's your girlfriend look
in black?

18:11.089 --> 18:12.289
Sit.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.091
Now listen to me
very carefully:

18:14.093 --> 18:15.225
You're done mouthing off.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.094
I'm gonna ask
the questions from now on.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.562
You're just gonna nod yes or no.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.931
Bryan Carpenter,
do you know him?

18:22.068 --> 18:24.835
That's not technically
a yes or a no.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.103
I'm gonna take it

18:26.105 --> 18:30.040
as a yes. I'm also gonna assume
that you did this.

18:31.676 --> 18:33.043
What happened?

18:35.914 --> 18:38.215
This morning, where were you?

18:38.217 --> 18:41.218
Complying with the state's
unconstitutional invasion

18:41.220 --> 18:42.386
of my physical sovereignty.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.620
Come again?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.924
I was peeing in a cup
for my P.O. You can ask him.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.127
Okay, well, that still doesn't
mean you didn't order the hit.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.296
Why would I do that?
Bryan was my friend.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.397
Let's assume that

18:53.399 --> 18:55.365
you're telling the truth again
for two seconds.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.067
Why would somebody want
to kill him?

18:57.069 --> 19:00.737
I have no idea. And why do you
care about one of mines anyway?

19:00.739 --> 19:01.738
Shouldn't you be celebrating

19:01.740 --> 19:03.574
at a donut shop or something
right now?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.008
That sounds excellent.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.811
Get up.

19:11.082 --> 19:14.351
Now here's your itinerary
for the next couple of days:

19:14.353 --> 19:15.452
nothing.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.988
You don't move from here,
you understand?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.524
HPD's gonna sit on your place
until we straighten this out.

19:20.526 --> 19:23.327
If I hear that you leave,
even to take your library books back,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.896
Detective Williams and I,
we're gonna come back

19:25.898 --> 19:28.832
and we're not gonna be
as courteous next time.

19:30.001 --> 19:31.335
Well, that was very subtle.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.103
I'm sure he's calling whoever
killed Matt right now

19:33.105 --> 19:34.471
and telling 'em
to lay low.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.406
What are you talking?
He didn't order the hit.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.242
Did you see
the look on his face?

19:38.244 --> 19:39.209
He didn't know anything.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.744
Okay, well,
if that's the case,

19:40.746 --> 19:43.213
then we have to consider
the possibility that Matt was dirty, okay?

19:43.215 --> 19:44.481
Dirty.
Yes, dirty, okay?

19:44.483 --> 19:46.250
If he was selling
information to the crew

19:46.252 --> 19:48.185
that ripped off Dekker and
he slipped off somewhere,

19:48.187 --> 19:49.386
it would've gotten
him killed.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.156
Danny, Matt was a cop.
I know he was a cop, okay?

19:52.158 --> 19:54.224
I knew plenty of guys
back in New Jersey

19:54.226 --> 19:55.492
that were undercover
for so long,

19:55.494 --> 19:57.027
they ended up slipping;

19:57.029 --> 19:58.695
they didn't know
what the line was.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.830
Just-Just wait.
Just wait.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.966
Yes, Mary?

20:02.968 --> 20:04.501
Wait-- what?!

20:04.503 --> 20:06.003
And so it begins.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.239
Salmonella?

20:10.408 --> 20:11.642
Really?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.511
I shouldn't have eaten
that egg salad on the plane.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.181
Yeah.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.717
Mary, this is exactly what
we were talking about before.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.486
Steve, bad eggs
have nothing to do

20:22.488 --> 20:23.820
with my parenting skills, okay?

20:23.822 --> 20:25.088
I could be a good mother,

20:25.090 --> 20:26.323
just not right now.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.225
I really need you
to watch Joan

20:28.227 --> 20:30.561
for me 'cause I have
to stay her overnight.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.363
No! No, no, no! I can't do that.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.264
Steve, you have to.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.365
Mary, no, Mary...

20:35.367 --> 20:36.533
I don't have anybody else
to call!

20:36.535 --> 20:38.335
I have
to stay here over...

20:38.337 --> 20:40.904
Mary, I'm in the middle,
I'm in the middle

20:40.906 --> 20:42.339
of a homicide investigation.

20:42.341 --> 20:45.209
Okay.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.110
I'll just call
Child Protective Services.

20:47.112 --> 20:50.514
And Joan will have to be placed

20:50.516 --> 20:52.416
with a foster care family
for a while.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.351
I just hope
that the trauma doesn't

20:54.353 --> 20:57.020
affect her cognitive
development.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.323
Cognitive? You don't even know
what that word means.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.792
You're a horrible uncle,

21:01.794 --> 21:04.194
you know that?

21:09.968 --> 21:11.802
This funny to you?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.003
Yeah!

21:13.005 --> 21:14.504
So when you're through
amusing yourself,

21:14.506 --> 21:16.057
I need you to wipe down
her changing pad, please.

21:16.082 --> 21:17.542
Not at all.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.042
I'm retired, you see.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.711
And it's gonna be way
too entertaining

21:20.713 --> 21:23.847
to see Uncle Steve
on diaper duty. So go ahead.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.149
Hey, why is there a baby
attached to your chest?

21:26.151 --> 21:27.284
Oh, uh, Mary.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.552
Ah. Say no more.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.254
Yeah.
Mazel tov.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.856
Thanks.
Anyway, I was able to track down

21:32.858 --> 21:34.738
the manufacturer of the key
we found at Matt's house.

21:34.739 --> 21:35.249
Oh, good.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.861
It traces back to a set of locks
that they sold

21:37.863 --> 21:39.062
to Honolulu Zoo.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.631
Oh, let me see that.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.567
Actually, you know what?
Here, just for a second.

21:43.569 --> 21:44.968
What?
Thank you.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.404
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, Danny,

21:47.406 --> 21:48.972
let's go.
Okay.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.807
Wait.
If she gets hungry,

21:50.809 --> 21:52.776
bottle in here.
You got it? Let's go.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.480
Wait-- how am I supposed
to know if she's hungry?

21:56.482 --> 21:59.249
Oh, you'll know.
Trust me, you'll know.

22:05.957 --> 22:08.525
Sato?

22:08.527 --> 22:09.593
I don't know any Sato.

22:09.595 --> 22:12.095
You know for somebody
who likes to gamble,

22:12.097 --> 22:14.164
you don't have
a very good poker face.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.767
Your name is Hideaki Kuroda.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.402
You're Sato's moneyman.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.837
You have a wife.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.005
You have two children.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.573
Rosie and Kin.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.176
Now, Rosie, she's
very talented at the piano.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.879
And Kin, well, he aced math,

22:28.881 --> 22:30.447
but he needs a science tutor.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.749
Right?
Oh, and you just brought, um,

22:32.751 --> 22:35.052
a brand-new sports car.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.553
For your mistress.

22:38.489 --> 22:39.656
So far, so good?

22:39.658 --> 22:41.692
I also know

22:41.694 --> 22:44.027
that you want
out of Sato's crew.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.129
But you can't
because you've been gambling

22:46.131 --> 22:47.397
with your boss' money.

22:47.399 --> 22:48.999
And you've been losing.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.268
Trying to cover it up,
moving the money around

22:51.270 --> 22:52.302
from place to place.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.904
But that hole?

22:53.906 --> 22:56.006
Yeah, that hole
just keeps getting deeper.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.307
And deeper.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.042
Now if I know this,

22:59.044 --> 23:00.777
Then really it's
only a matter of time

23:00.779 --> 23:02.412
before Sato figures it out.

23:02.414 --> 23:06.149
And when he realizes
that he can't get his money back

23:06.151 --> 23:07.617
because you lost it
at blackjack and craps,

23:07.619 --> 23:09.853
and roulette and horses,

23:09.855 --> 23:12.589
he is gonna hurt you
in the worst way that he can.

23:12.591 --> 23:14.191
Now, we can help you,

23:14.193 --> 23:16.193
Mr. Kuroda, but you first
you got to tell me

23:16.195 --> 23:17.828
where I can find Sato.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.098
What business do
you have with Sato?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.033
I don't give a damn about Sato.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.468
I just want to ask him

23:24.470 --> 23:27.337
where I can find Adam Noshimuri.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.781
There it is.
There are the lockers.

23:37.783 --> 23:41.518
B-24.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.762
Wow.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.964
You still think
Matt's not dirty?

24:03.732 --> 24:04.734
<i>Okay.</i>

24:04.735 --> 24:06.267
We got over
a $100,000 cash.

24:06.269 --> 24:07.635
Explain to me how is it

24:07.637 --> 24:10.105
that an undercover cop has
this kind of money?

24:10.107 --> 24:11.406
I can't.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.540
Okay? I can't.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.008
But that doesn't
make him dirty.

24:14.010 --> 24:14.976
Steve, he had

24:14.978 --> 24:16.211
the key to that locker

24:16.213 --> 24:17.846
hidden in a shower drain.

24:17.848 --> 24:19.381
He did not want anyone

24:19.383 --> 24:20.815
to see this cash-- why?

24:20.817 --> 24:22.250
Maybe he was getting paid

24:22.252 --> 24:24.119
for inside information
by the guys

24:24.121 --> 24:25.487
that were ripping off Decker.

24:25.489 --> 24:26.521
That's a big maybe

24:26.523 --> 24:27.589
for a guy who put his wife

24:27.591 --> 24:28.957
and his son's lives
on the backburner

24:28.959 --> 24:30.658
for three years
to take Dekker down.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.927
Don't mind the smell.

24:32.929 --> 24:33.928
Ooh!
Yeah, I know.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.263
Strained peas.

24:35.265 --> 24:36.865
Only partially digested.

24:36.867 --> 24:37.999
Here, could you, uh...?

24:38.001 --> 24:39.367
Hey, hi.
Thanks.

24:39.369 --> 24:41.770
Did you, uh, get anything
besides throw up?

24:41.772 --> 24:43.605
Funny.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.241
I ran the credit histories
on Matt and his wife.

24:46.243 --> 24:48.309
Nothing unusual--
they live paycheck to paycheck

24:48.311 --> 24:49.644
just like most honest
hard-working

24:49.646 --> 24:50.845
civil servants on the island.

24:52.549 --> 24:55.016
Wow!

24:55.018 --> 24:55.850
Oh.

24:55.852 --> 24:56.551
Hmm?

24:56.553 --> 24:58.052
Can we focus over here?

24:58.054 --> 24:59.220
Yeah, you ran the finances,
no surprises.

24:59.222 --> 25:01.122
Good, what else we got?

25:01.124 --> 25:02.690
I dumped Matt's phone.
The only thing of note

25:02.692 --> 25:03.925
was a series of phone calls

25:03.927 --> 25:06.428
to a local real estate agent
all in the last week.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.329
Name of Cherie Tranton.

25:08.331 --> 25:09.664
Real estate agent?

25:09.666 --> 25:10.632
That seem strange to you?

25:10.634 --> 25:11.633
Maybe the lease is up

25:11.635 --> 25:13.168
on, uh, on his place.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.036
Ah, yeah, or maybe he was
looking to buy some property

25:15.038 --> 25:16.604
and launder some of this cash.

25:16.606 --> 25:17.806
I'll check in with Agent
Kennedy.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.474
See if he knows
anything about the money

25:19.476 --> 25:20.909
or the real estate agent.

25:20.911 --> 25:23.044
You know what, Chin?
Hold off on that for now.

25:23.046 --> 25:24.179
Let's take a look at
Matt's field reports first.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.347
I want to keep ATF out
of the loop for now.

25:26.349 --> 25:28.116
Well, Kennedy had all
the same intel Matt did.

25:28.118 --> 25:29.884
You know?
Oh, I see.

25:29.886 --> 25:31.986
So I'm crazy,
my-my theory is nuts

25:31.988 --> 25:33.455
thinking that Matt went bad,

25:33.457 --> 25:34.656
but your new amazing idea

25:34.658 --> 25:37.959
is Matt's handler was the one

25:37.961 --> 25:40.895
giving information to the guys
that ripped off Dekker.

25:40.897 --> 25:42.297
Well, I'm just saying
it's possible, okay?

25:42.299 --> 25:44.165
We all heard what Kennedy's
transcriber said.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.633
Kennedy could've
pulled Matt out

25:45.635 --> 25:47.001
and taken the case
down weeks ago.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.303
That would explain
why Kennedy kept Matt

25:48.305 --> 25:49.904
out in the field so long.
Right.

25:49.906 --> 25:51.539
So let's just take a closer
look at the transcripts.

25:51.541 --> 25:53.107
See if we're missing anything.

25:53.109 --> 25:55.143
All right?

25:55.145 --> 25:56.311
Wah!

25:56.313 --> 25:57.812
What are we doing?
It's your turn.

25:57.814 --> 25:59.881
My turn for what?
We're a team.

25:59.883 --> 26:01.950
Danny, everybody's got
to put in 110%.

26:01.952 --> 26:03.718
Look at this--
that's 110% right there.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.920
Chin and I, we're gonna go
talk to Dekker see if he can

26:05.922 --> 26:07.121
shed some light on this cash.
In the meantime,

26:07.123 --> 26:08.890
while you're on
babysitting duty,

26:08.892 --> 26:10.191
run background

26:10.193 --> 26:11.259
on this real estate agent.

26:11.261 --> 26:12.494
See if there's
any connection

26:12.496 --> 26:13.895
between Dekker's crew
and Cherie Tranton.

26:13.897 --> 26:15.363
And try not to let her
drool on the evidence.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.098
We're gonna need it.

26:17.100 --> 26:20.935
Smart kid.
Uh, I got an idea.

26:20.937 --> 26:22.303
Uh, why don't I step up
for the team and,

26:22.305 --> 26:23.738
uh, Chin and I will go out.

26:23.740 --> 26:25.473
You stay here, make those calls,
and deal with, uh,

26:25.475 --> 26:27.842
your soiled niece here?
Change her soon.

26:27.844 --> 26:29.477
You understand?
Or she gets a rash.

26:29.479 --> 26:30.945
Oh, does she?

26:30.947 --> 26:32.380
Diaper bag's
in Steve's office.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.582
Bottles are in the fridge.

26:34.584 --> 26:36.684
You're gonna need that.

26:44.493 --> 26:46.961
Why was this in a storage locker

26:46.963 --> 26:48.029
belonging to your dead friend?

26:48.031 --> 26:49.063
Let me guess.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.899
There's a hundred grand
in there.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.568
How did you know that?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.069
'Cause I gave it to him.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.538
Bryan asked me for a loan.

26:56.540 --> 26:57.505
Said he'd get it back

26:57.507 --> 26:58.706
to me by the weekend.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.408
Wait a minute--
a guy asks you

27:00.410 --> 27:02.577
for a hundred thousand dollars
and you just give it to him?

27:02.579 --> 27:03.745
Yeah, I trust my friends.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.980
What he want the money for?

27:05.982 --> 27:08.516
I don't ask for details, man.

27:08.518 --> 27:10.818
What I don't know
won't put me in a box.

27:10.820 --> 27:12.520
Now if you're done harassing me,

27:12.522 --> 27:15.456
I'm gonna get some fish tacos
with my police escort.

27:17.192 --> 27:19.294
If Matt didn't steal
that money...

27:19.296 --> 27:20.461
Yeah, it throws some cold water

27:20.463 --> 27:22.230
on the theory that he was dirty.
Hey, Dekker?

27:22.232 --> 27:24.766
I'm done talking
until I get my money back.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.000
Oh, you mean
this donation

27:26.002 --> 27:27.569
to the Widows and Orphans Fund?

27:27.571 --> 27:29.270
That's very generous of you.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.272
Now, listen, why don't you
tell me about this crew

27:31.274 --> 27:32.707
that's been ripping you off--
who are they?

27:32.709 --> 27:35.009
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

27:35.011 --> 27:36.277
Those guys
that have been hitting you

27:36.279 --> 27:38.146
are probably the guys
that killed your friend.

27:38.148 --> 27:39.681
Well, then I sincerely hope
you catch them.

27:39.683 --> 27:41.482
Okay, listen to me.

27:41.484 --> 27:43.651
Hey, hey.

27:45.821 --> 27:48.356
I know you've been taking
some big financial hits lately.

27:48.358 --> 27:51.693
Okay? So I want
to do you a favor.

27:51.695 --> 27:53.127
I'm going to extend
our police presence.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.963
You and everybody
in your life

27:54.965 --> 27:57.031
is gonna be protected
by HPD 24-seven.

27:57.033 --> 27:58.866
Just to make sure you feel safe.

27:58.868 --> 28:00.935
We're gonna have eyes
on you day and night.

28:00.937 --> 28:03.338
Yeah, good luck
in the import/export biz.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.139
Enjoy your tacos.

28:06.775 --> 28:08.443
Wait.

28:11.614 --> 28:13.815
I got something
that might help.

28:15.517 --> 28:17.318
This is an in-house
surveillance video

28:17.320 --> 28:19.821
from a local gang getting
ripped off by another crew.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.723
What's in the crates?

28:21.725 --> 28:23.524
Guns, drugs
and other party favors.

28:23.526 --> 28:24.859
I'm more interested
in the guys

28:24.861 --> 28:25.860
behind the masks.

28:25.862 --> 28:27.028
Is there any way
we can ID these guys,

28:27.030 --> 28:29.364
Charlie?
There's always a way.

28:29.366 --> 28:31.532
I'll call you
when I got something.

28:31.534 --> 28:33.368
All right, thanks, buddy.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.870
Hey, Charlie?

28:35.872 --> 28:37.305
It's good to have you back.

28:37.307 --> 28:41.242
<i>Once upon a time there was</i>
<i>a very handsome prince.</i>

28:41.244 --> 28:43.077
And this, uh,
handsome prince had

28:43.079 --> 28:44.679
a very beautiful
black stallion.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.347
And this black stallion
was, uh, was admired

28:46.349 --> 28:48.750
by everybody in the kingdom.

28:48.752 --> 28:51.986
He was the fastest and fairest
stallion in the land,

28:51.988 --> 28:55.390
about 528 horsepower,
very nice stallion, anyway.

28:55.392 --> 28:58.459
Uh, one day, uh,

28:58.461 --> 29:00.161
this incredibly
handsome prince...

29:00.163 --> 29:02.563
Yeah, he was, he was out
of sight, let me tell you.

29:02.565 --> 29:04.866
He was partnered up
with a mean ogre.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.201
A disgusting, hairy ogre.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.903
It was not a match
made in heaven.

29:08.905 --> 29:11.806
They would slay dragons together
from time to time.

29:11.808 --> 29:13.908
And they'd argue all the
time and, of course,

29:13.910 --> 29:16.511
the brilliant charming prince
would-would win those arguments

29:16.513 --> 29:18.179
because the ogre was a dope.

29:18.181 --> 29:19.814
Despite their,
uh, victories,

29:19.816 --> 29:21.716
there was a dark
cloud that loomed.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.884
Because...

29:22.886 --> 29:24.585
the dopey ogre coveted

29:24.587 --> 29:28.122
the handsome prince's
stallion, okay?

29:28.124 --> 29:31.259
And he was
a very greedy, selfish ogre

29:31.261 --> 29:32.760
with-with major control issues.

29:32.762 --> 29:34.162
And he would never let

29:34.164 --> 29:36.998
the handsome prince
ride his own stallion.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.333
Hold on, we're gonna pick
this up in a second.

29:41.004 --> 29:43.371
Great, it's
the real estate agent.

29:43.373 --> 29:44.939
Hello.

29:44.941 --> 29:47.742
Yes, yes it is.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.445
Uh, that's perfect.

29:50.447 --> 29:51.746
I can, uh, I can meet you there.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.247
What's, uh, what's the address?

29:56.719 --> 29:57.852
That was fast.

29:57.854 --> 29:59.487
Making up for lost time.
Check it out.

29:59.489 --> 30:01.923
I got a clean screen capture
on one of your guys.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.091
We can estimate height,

30:03.093 --> 30:04.392
weight, shoe size.

30:04.394 --> 30:06.861
If we run those traits
through the HPD arrest database?

30:06.863 --> 30:08.196
We're gonna get
dozens of matches

30:08.198 --> 30:09.931
and then lots of possible suspects.
But...

30:09.933 --> 30:12.300
if we measure
Pupillary distance,

30:12.302 --> 30:13.968
which in this case is

30:13.970 --> 30:15.503
63.2 millimeters,

30:15.505 --> 30:17.472
and we combine it
with all of the other traits,

30:17.474 --> 30:20.007
it narrows
the field considerably.

30:21.443 --> 30:23.377
Aloha, Joey Tillman.

30:23.379 --> 30:24.946
Okay, what do we got?
Robbery, guns,

30:24.948 --> 30:27.849
assault, more robbery.
This has to be our guy.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.655
You know, SWAT's on its way.

30:34.657 --> 30:35.823
Maybe I don't need to ask this,

30:35.825 --> 30:37.191
but should we wait?

30:39.496 --> 30:40.461
That's what I thought.

30:41.231 --> 30:42.497
Cover!

30:54.777 --> 30:57.311
Looks like we got
three shooters.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.613
These guy move weapons
for a living.

30:58.615 --> 31:00.248
They're gonna be
armed to the teeth.

31:03.886 --> 31:05.653
We're gonna need more guns.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.984
You should've waited for SWAT.

31:28.986 --> 31:30.585
You really want to do this now?

31:42.832 --> 31:44.499
Hold fire!

31:46.836 --> 31:49.004
This is HPD SWAT!

31:49.006 --> 31:50.706
Drop your weapons and come out.

31:50.708 --> 31:51.974
You are outnumbered.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.709
This is your one warning.

32:04.554 --> 32:05.721
That's Tillman.

32:11.127 --> 32:13.495
Clear!

32:15.198 --> 32:16.999
Clear!
Hey, yo.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.867
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

32:20.403 --> 32:22.871
Same crates we saw
in the surveillance videos.

32:22.873 --> 32:24.806
These have got to be the guys
that've been ripping off Dekker.

32:24.808 --> 32:26.174
All right, let's get
an alert out right away.

32:26.176 --> 32:28.110
I thought you said there
were three shooters.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.178
There were. Third guy must've
slipped out the back.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.646
Oh, he slipped out the back.

32:31.648 --> 32:34.016
Well, that's
exemplary work, Commander.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.851
Steve.

32:35.853 --> 32:38.020
Take a look at this.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.821
Entry wound's in the
back of the head.

32:41.924 --> 32:44.626
We didn't kill these guys.

32:44.628 --> 32:45.927
The third shooter did.

32:45.929 --> 32:47.929
Oh, you mean the guy
that escaped on your watch?

32:47.931 --> 32:49.598
On my watch? You were
standing right next to me

32:49.600 --> 32:50.632
when this went down.

32:50.634 --> 32:51.900
See, it wouldn't have gone down

32:51.902 --> 32:53.268
if you just waited a little bit

32:53.270 --> 32:54.536
and let SWAT do its job.

32:54.538 --> 32:56.838
But, hey, like I said,

32:56.840 --> 32:58.573
exemplary work, Commander.

33:01.811 --> 33:03.645
All right, listen up.
So why does he shoot his own guys?

33:03.647 --> 33:05.680
We got a shooter
on the run.

33:05.682 --> 33:07.182
Well, maybe he's
tying up loose ends.

33:07.184 --> 33:09.151
Which could be the same
motive for killing Matt.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.385
Maybe this third
shooter knew that

33:10.387 --> 33:11.386
Matt was getting
close to the crew.

33:11.388 --> 33:12.988
We need
to work out

33:12.990 --> 33:15.090
what Matt wanted
that money for.

33:15.825 --> 33:17.526
<i>All new construction,</i>

33:17.528 --> 33:19.828
brand-new carpeting,

33:19.830 --> 33:22.531
engineered quartz
countertops.

33:22.533 --> 33:25.067
And there's
a great school district

33:25.069 --> 33:26.968
for your little girl,
when she's ready.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.270
Oh, no, that's, uh...
that's very nice.

33:28.272 --> 33:29.438
She's, uh...
she's actually

33:29.440 --> 33:31.306
a friend of mine's.
I'm just babysitting.

33:31.308 --> 33:33.041
I'm, uh...
I'm single.

33:33.043 --> 33:34.443
Oh, my.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.477
Well...

33:35.479 --> 33:37.979
So refreshing
to meet somebody

33:37.981 --> 33:39.548
who's so...
giving.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.416
You must be

33:41.418 --> 33:43.351
a very warm person.

33:43.353 --> 33:44.619
And you're so fit.

33:44.621 --> 33:46.154
Oh, thank you
very much.

33:46.156 --> 33:48.023
I just appreciate
a man

33:48.025 --> 33:49.391
who can wear
a pair of pants.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.961
Okay.
Well...

33:52.963 --> 33:54.196
Now, this condo's got
a great layout.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.631
Although... there's
only one bedroom.

33:56.633 --> 33:57.666
Wink.

33:57.668 --> 33:59.267
Look at that.
She said "wink, wink,"

33:59.269 --> 34:00.936
and then she winked.

34:00.938 --> 34:03.038
So tell me...
Huh?

34:03.040 --> 34:04.206
...what winds of fortune

34:04.208 --> 34:06.942
have blown your little ship
into my harbor?

34:06.944 --> 34:09.277
Oh, um... Matt Hutchins,

34:09.279 --> 34:10.378
actually
recommended you.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.481
Mr. Hutchins!
Yeah.

34:12.483 --> 34:13.782
Oh, did he rent
the apartment for you?

34:13.784 --> 34:14.716
Yes, he did.

34:14.717 --> 34:15.951
I have to say,

34:15.953 --> 34:17.252
this was
a first for me.

34:17.254 --> 34:19.154
I mean, I have people who come
and want to window shop,

34:19.156 --> 34:20.688
but I've never had someone
want to rent a condo

34:20.690 --> 34:21.922
for just one day.

34:21.925 --> 34:24.159
Well, uh,
yeah, one day.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.161
That's all we
need it for.

34:25.161 --> 34:26.161
Today's that
day, so...

34:26.163 --> 34:27.661
here we are.
Tomorrow, silly.

34:27.664 --> 34:29.063
Tomorrow, yes,
of course.

34:29.065 --> 34:31.132
Tomorrow's that day,
that's what I meant.

34:31.135 --> 34:32.467
You know,
for $1,000,

34:32.469 --> 34:34.235
you boys must
have something

34:34.237 --> 34:35.904
scintillating planned,

34:35.906 --> 34:39.574
so you better keep Cherie's
number in your phone.

34:39.576 --> 34:42.377
Homeowner's association
doesn't like little side deals

34:42.379 --> 34:44.212
like this, so it's
our little secret, okay?

34:44.214 --> 34:45.880
All right.
Cherie, you're very naughty.

34:45.882 --> 34:49.717
Honey...
you have no idea.

34:52.321 --> 34:55.023
You are gonna
love this view.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.824
Wow, very nice.

35:02.331 --> 35:04.533
I know.

35:06.836 --> 35:08.403
Hey, Steve.

35:08.405 --> 35:09.671
Something you gotta see.
Come down here.

35:09.673 --> 35:11.873
It seems like

35:11.875 --> 35:13.241
Matt was running
surveillance

35:13.243 --> 35:15.076
on the lockers where
we found the money.

35:15.078 --> 35:16.912
You know what,
if you're gonna

35:16.914 --> 35:18.947
hold the baby
in the sun, okay,

35:18.949 --> 35:20.081
just ask me

35:20.083 --> 35:21.316
and I'll put
a sunhat on her.

35:21.318 --> 35:22.484
You know what, though?

35:22.486 --> 35:23.518
The question is,
why would he

35:23.520 --> 35:24.853
be doing surveillance
on the lockers?

35:24.855 --> 35:25.787
Okay, Matt recorded

35:25.789 --> 35:27.322
all the times
and dates

35:27.324 --> 35:28.790
of Dekker's weapons
transactions.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.292
- Right?
- Yeah.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.660
The crew that was
ripping Dekker off

35:31.662 --> 35:32.827
had all that
information.

35:32.829 --> 35:34.763
Are you thinking that Matt
thought that someone

35:34.765 --> 35:36.031
in the ATF leaked it?

35:36.033 --> 35:37.132
I think he was
building a case.

35:37.134 --> 35:38.266
I mean, he could
have borrowed

35:38.268 --> 35:39.467
the money
off of Dekker,

35:39.469 --> 35:40.902
planted it
in the lockers

35:40.904 --> 35:42.370
to set up whoever
was leaking that information.

35:42.372 --> 35:43.605
If that were the case,

35:43.607 --> 35:44.839
he would have
planted the misinformation

35:44.841 --> 35:45.807
in one of his reports.

35:45.809 --> 35:48.343
Now look at this...

35:48.345 --> 35:49.745
Here's an entry
about the money drop

35:49.746 --> 35:51.246
at Honolulu Zoo.

35:51.248 --> 35:53.615
Set to be dropped
off at 9:00 a.m.,

35:53.617 --> 35:55.016
picked up at
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

35:55.018 --> 35:56.218
All right, that's
a two hour window

35:56.220 --> 35:57.219
for the money to be stolen.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.320
Yep, we were right.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.088
Matt was setting
someone up at the ATF.

36:00.090 --> 36:01.656
Kennedy.

36:01.658 --> 36:03.124
He could have been selling
information to Tillman

36:03.126 --> 36:04.226
about Dekker's
operation.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.727
That's why he
kept the case open

36:05.729 --> 36:07.128
and Matt undercover
for so long.

36:07.130 --> 36:08.296
He was onto
a good thing,

36:08.298 --> 36:09.431
he didn't want
it to end.

36:09.433 --> 36:11.066
Well, he keeps
his hands clean,

36:11.068 --> 36:12.467
and he gets
a cut of the profits.

36:12.469 --> 36:14.302
And then when he found out
that Matt was on to him,

36:14.304 --> 36:16.571
Kennedy got one of
Tillman's guys to kill him.

36:16.573 --> 36:19.341
Where are you going?

36:19.343 --> 36:20.675
I'm going to finish
what Matt started.

36:20.677 --> 36:21.910
You want to come?

36:21.912 --> 36:24.045
Let's do it.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.500
<i>All right, so listen up.</i>

36:34.502 --> 36:36.502
Grab whoever
picks up this money

36:36.504 --> 36:37.903
the second
they open the locker.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.738
I want this entire place
locked down.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.273
I want men on every exit,

36:41.275 --> 36:44.143
and I want two men every 30
yards around the perimeter.

36:44.145 --> 36:45.177
Let's go.

36:45.179 --> 36:46.845
I wouldn't have
done it this way.

36:46.847 --> 36:48.113
Yeah, you don't say?

36:48.115 --> 36:49.214
McGarrett,
we should wait.

36:49.216 --> 36:51.750
Let your suspect
exit the zoo,

36:51.752 --> 36:52.885
then you
take him down.

36:52.887 --> 36:53.886
That way,
we don't get

36:53.888 --> 36:54.987
into a firefight

36:54.989 --> 36:56.188
in the middle of
all these civilians.

36:56.190 --> 36:58.090
I want to secure
the perimeter.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.491
Okay?
He's not going to escape this time.

36:59.493 --> 37:01.126
He wouldn't have
escaped last time

37:01.128 --> 37:02.161
if you'd have just
waited for SWAT.

37:02.163 --> 37:03.062
I could've been dead

37:03.064 --> 37:04.963
if I waited for SWAT.
Maybe.

37:04.965 --> 37:06.498
But there's a right way
and a wrong way

37:06.500 --> 37:07.599
to do things.

37:07.601 --> 37:09.435
You don't like me.
All right? I get that.

37:09.437 --> 37:10.569
But I'm in command

37:10.571 --> 37:12.404
and control of
this operation

37:12.406 --> 37:13.405
I'm also
the team leader, okay?

37:13.407 --> 37:14.373
So you and your team,

37:14.375 --> 37:16.108
you can come
aboard with us

37:16.110 --> 37:18.143
or you can stand down.

37:18.145 --> 37:20.913
Whatever
you say, uh...

37:20.915 --> 37:22.114
Commander.

37:35.695 --> 37:37.463
Nothing.

37:37.465 --> 37:39.665
Did you remember
to give Joan her bottle?

37:41.568 --> 37:42.734
Of course I did.

37:44.003 --> 37:45.671
You're texting Max
right now, aren't you?

37:45.673 --> 37:46.438
No, I'm not.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.507
You're a terrible liar.

37:50.176 --> 37:52.144
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got something.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.546
Black hoodie, straight ahead.

37:53.547 --> 37:56.281
Moving fast, heading straight
for the lockers.

38:10.463 --> 38:13.332
Hold it
right there.

38:18.738 --> 38:20.439
Took you long enough.

38:20.441 --> 38:21.740
Traffic.

38:24.544 --> 38:25.944
Don't move a muscle.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.522
Why?

38:39.092 --> 38:40.959
Take a look around, Linda.

38:40.961 --> 38:43.428
Look at where
you are.

38:43.430 --> 38:45.030
You see this room? You don't get
to this room by accident.

38:45.032 --> 38:47.432
It's over.

38:47.434 --> 38:50.068
We know you were
feeding Matt's intel

38:50.070 --> 38:51.470
to your
boyfriend here.

38:51.472 --> 38:52.437
And we know

38:52.439 --> 38:53.605
that with
that information,

38:53.607 --> 38:54.940
he and two of
his associates

38:54.942 --> 38:56.742
were able to systematically
rip off Dekker's crew.

38:56.744 --> 38:58.443
Yesterday,

38:58.445 --> 38:59.745
this guy
right here,

38:59.747 --> 39:01.380
he put two bullets
in the back of their heads

39:01.382 --> 39:02.848
to make sure
they kept quiet.

39:02.850 --> 39:04.116
Now, who's to say

39:04.118 --> 39:05.417
he wouldn't have done
the same thing to you

39:05.419 --> 39:06.752
after you collected
that money?

39:06.754 --> 39:08.487
Matt trusted us.

39:08.489 --> 39:11.023
No, we were
his lifeline.

39:11.025 --> 39:12.457
And y-you betrayed him.

39:12.459 --> 39:13.492
For what?
Money?

39:13.494 --> 39:14.760
No.

39:14.762 --> 39:16.395
We just didn't want
to go to jail.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.596
Shut up, Linda!

39:19.666 --> 39:21.233
You make me understand.

39:22.502 --> 39:25.604
Why'd you have
to kill him?

39:28.942 --> 39:30.809
Matt called
a few weeks ago.

39:30.811 --> 39:32.311
He wanted
to know

39:32.313 --> 39:34.112
who had access to
his transcripts.

39:36.316 --> 39:38.517
He suspected that his reports
had been compromised.

39:38.519 --> 39:39.651
It was only a matter of time

39:39.653 --> 39:41.687
until he traced
that back to us.

39:42.989 --> 39:45.824
I'm... sorry.

39:45.826 --> 39:47.526
I'm...

39:47.528 --> 39:49.161
so sorry.

39:49.163 --> 39:50.362
You done here?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.702
Now I am.

40:05.745 --> 40:07.879
<i>Maybe I should've...</i>
<i>pulled Matt out.</i>

40:07.881 --> 40:10.249
You know,
if I-I'd just

40:10.251 --> 40:13.185
pushed the button
sooner...

40:13.187 --> 40:15.954
What say we go
push it now?

40:19.893 --> 40:21.293
What the hell is this?

40:21.295 --> 40:23.061
There was nothing
incriminating

40:23.063 --> 40:24.496
on that tape
I gave you.

40:24.498 --> 40:25.564
Where's my money?

40:25.566 --> 40:26.832
Where's your money?

40:26.834 --> 40:29.635
Good news is, we got your money
<i>and</i> your guns.

40:29.637 --> 40:32.704
Bad news is, we got your money
and your guns.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.980
Allison, there's something
you need to see.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.418
Hey, Matty.

40:46.420 --> 40:48.887
You know, I often dream about

40:48.889 --> 40:51.523
the kind of man you'll become...

40:51.525 --> 40:54.226
your strength and courage,

40:54.228 --> 40:56.328
your sense of right and wrong.

40:56.330 --> 40:57.896
There are so many things

40:57.898 --> 41:00.065
a father wants to teach his son,

41:00.067 --> 41:02.467
and sometimes you gotta
teach by example.

41:02.469 --> 41:05.137
In accepting this assignment,

41:05.139 --> 41:07.105
I hope I've helped make this
world the kind of place

41:07.107 --> 41:08.707
you deserve to grow up in.

41:08.709 --> 41:12.544
Son, there's always
hard choices in life,

41:12.546 --> 41:15.580
sacrifices that need to be made.

41:15.582 --> 41:18.150
I just want you to know
Daddy made this one

41:18.152 --> 41:20.652
out of the love I have
for you and your mother.

41:23.389 --> 41:26.158
You take care of her, kid.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.060
You're the man
of the house now.

41:37.003 --> 41:39.137
<i>There we go.</i>

41:39.139 --> 41:41.606
Come on.

41:41.608 --> 41:43.642
Aw, no dings
or scratches.

41:43.644 --> 41:46.745
Looks like Uncle Steve
did a good job.

41:46.747 --> 41:48.480
I had a job to do,
I did it.

41:48.482 --> 41:49.581
That's all.

41:49.583 --> 41:51.016
Oh, admit it.
You had a little bit of fun.

41:51.018 --> 41:52.184
I just saw you.

41:52.186 --> 41:54.152
I-I definitely had
a lot of fun.

41:54.154 --> 41:56.154
Yeah, she's a great
kid, Mary.

41:56.156 --> 41:57.522
Aw, thank you.

41:57.524 --> 41:59.257
Well, next time I need a sitter
I'll call on you two.

41:59.259 --> 42:01.827
Excuse me for
a minute here, please.

42:01.829 --> 42:03.362
Yes, we all contributed,
but I was

42:03.364 --> 42:05.964
primary on this one,
I'd like to say.

42:05.966 --> 42:07.165
Okay, tough guy.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.134
Say goodbye
to your uncles!

42:09.136 --> 42:10.635
Where-where you going?
You don't... what?

42:10.637 --> 42:11.837
You don't need
to rush off, do you?

42:11.839 --> 42:13.505
Just stick around
for a bit.

42:13.507 --> 42:15.107
Yeah, we just, uh,
wrapped up this case.

42:15.109 --> 42:16.475
We got nothing
on the board, so we could...

42:16.477 --> 42:18.110
...go out and get a bite to eat?
Right.

42:18.112 --> 42:19.411
Got plenty of
strained peas.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.213
Sorry, but we have

42:21.215 --> 42:24.015
Bouncy Baby Story Time
at the library in ten minutes.

42:24.017 --> 42:25.350
So say, bye,

42:25.352 --> 42:26.785
Uncle Steve!
Bye...

42:26.787 --> 42:28.553
Bye, Uncle Danny!

42:28.555 --> 42:30.322
Bye, Uncle Chin!

42:31.325 --> 42:32.758
All right.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.427
Thank you.

42:35.429 --> 42:36.328
Bye, guys.

42:36.330 --> 42:38.630
Okay. See you.
Bye.

42:42.735 --> 42:44.536
What?

42:44.538 --> 42:47.472
You're such a softy.
Nothing.

42:47.474 --> 42:48.440
Hey.

42:48.442 --> 42:50.142
You okay?
Never better.

42:50.144 --> 42:53.078
Got a location
on Sato.

42:53.080 --> 42:54.246
Full surveillance
package...

42:54.248 --> 42:55.647
address,
structural blueprints,

42:55.649 --> 42:56.581
security system,

42:56.583 --> 42:58.583

for his staff...

42:58.585 --> 42:59.618
Everything's there.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.752
It's all good.

43:00.754 --> 43:02.154
You, uh... do all that
by yourself?

43:02.156 --> 43:03.455
Uh-huh.

43:03.457 --> 43:05.323
What, you trying to
put us out of a job?

43:05.325 --> 43:07.859
No, just helping out
a friend.

43:07.861 --> 43:09.060
Okay.

43:09.062 --> 43:10.128
Oh, and, uh...

43:10.130 --> 43:12.063
Here. Thanks
for the loaner.

43:15.067 --> 43:16.535
You know what?

43:16.537 --> 43:18.236
Why don't you keep it?
What?

43:18.938 --> 43:20.272
Go ahead.

43:26.479 --> 43:27.479
You need a job.

43:27.481 --> 43:29.614
We need some help.

43:29.616 --> 43:31.416
Yeah. Trust me,

43:31.418 --> 43:33.485
this, uh, animal, he needs all the help
that he can get.

43:33.487 --> 43:35.353
Don't think about it.

43:35.355 --> 43:37.556
Just say yes.

43:39.358 --> 43:40.692
Okay.

43:40.694 --> 43:41.860
Yes.

43:41.862 --> 43:44.129
