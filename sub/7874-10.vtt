00:34.535 --> 00:38.038
Not a day goes by
where you are not in my thoughts.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.458
The love and respect I have
for you knows no limits.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.460
I long to caress your...

00:43.627 --> 00:46.506
Are you still writing that letter
to President Bush?

00:46.673 --> 00:50.051
It's an essay. The CIA operative
who writes the best one...

00:50.218 --> 00:52.554
...gets to meet the big cheese
in person.

00:52.721 --> 00:56.683
Eleven forty. If I don't email this
to work by midnight, it doesn't count.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.018
I need one last sentence
to make it perfect.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.689
- Can't you do this downstairs?
- No, I need you. You're my muse.

01:02.856 --> 01:05.441
Now shut up. I can't think
with your babbling. Wait!

01:05.608 --> 01:08.612
I've got it. A brilliant ending to my...

01:08.779 --> 01:12.616
- What was that?
- Probably just a loud noise.

01:13.701 --> 01:16.620
Pillow gun.
Where danger and comfort meet.

01:16.787 --> 01:18.622
Two hundred thread count.

01:18.789 --> 01:21.125
Two hundred dead count.

01:29.426 --> 01:32.721
Yeah, choke hold,
you miserable bastard thief.

01:32.888 --> 01:35.182
That's all you got?
You're gonna die in my arms.

01:35.348 --> 01:37.726
What do you think of that?
Wanna see yourself die?

01:37.893 --> 01:40.145
Come on, let's go watch you die.

01:40.312 --> 01:42.522
Oh, it's you.

01:43.482 --> 01:45.567
What the hell is the matter with you?

01:45.734 --> 01:48.654
Don't turn this around.
You missed your curfew.

01:48.821 --> 01:52.700
- Is that a hickey on your neck?
- What? No, it's a choke bruise.

01:52.867 --> 01:56.370
You kids with your
autoerotic asphyxiations.

01:56.537 --> 01:59.665
- What's this? Rum?
- It's not mine.

01:59.832 --> 02:01.834
- I don't know how it got there.
- Oh, sure.

02:02.001 --> 02:04.587
Throw that in with two measures
of gin and vermouth...

02:04.754 --> 02:07.924
...and you've got a liar's martini.
- Look, I put my purse down.

02:08.091 --> 02:11.178
Some girl must have put the flask
in there thinking it was hers.

02:11.345 --> 02:14.306
I don't have time for nonsense.
I have to finish my essay.

02:14.473 --> 02:16.016
You're still working on that?

02:16.183 --> 02:20.145
You've officially put more time into that
essay than he has on his presidency.

02:20.312 --> 02:24.024
How dare you talk that way about
the Dub? At least he's not a lush.

02:24.191 --> 02:26.026
He's been sober for 15 years.

02:26.193 --> 02:29.196
I'm pretty sure
that makes him a black belt.

02:30.365 --> 02:32.033
My essay.

02:33.034 --> 02:36.913
I had the perfect last sentence.
What was it? Damn it. No time.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.625
<i>Let the email soar.</i>

02:50.761 --> 02:51.929
Ben...

02:52.096 --> 02:53.389
...help me.

02:56.684 --> 02:58.686
Roger?

03:00.020 --> 03:03.649
Roger, why am I in a bathtub
full of ice?

03:03.816 --> 03:07.528
My baby. Everything's gonna be fine.

03:07.695 --> 03:09.739
What the hell are you doing?

03:09.905 --> 03:14.286
Oh, I'm harvesting one of your kidneys
to sell, then I'm gonna buy Dollywood.

03:14.453 --> 03:17.414
- Dollywood?
- Dolly Parton's theme park.

03:17.581 --> 03:20.292
The rides give you the same experience
as looking at her.

03:20.459 --> 03:23.336
Fun from far away,
but really scary up close.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.756
Anyway, it's on sale for $50 million.

03:25.922 --> 03:29.551
You moron.
You can't get $50 million for a kidney.

03:29.718 --> 03:34.265
Just once would it kill you to say,
"Good idea, Roger"?

03:38.269 --> 03:40.980
This was to celebrate.

03:43.649 --> 03:47.779
Which is why it's better to put too many
bullets in the head than too few.

03:47.945 --> 03:49.322
So let's review.

03:50.740 --> 03:53.952
Mr. Bullock,
Dick just shot me with a curare dart.

03:54.119 --> 03:57.831
He started it.

04:00.042 --> 04:04.171
Okay, people.
Again, the curare darts are not toys.

04:04.338 --> 04:06.965
They're for temporarily paralyzing
your enemies.

04:07.132 --> 04:09.343
Or just chilling out to some Zeppelin.

04:10.511 --> 04:14.015
Before you go,
I have your Bush essays.

04:14.182 --> 04:16.517
Smith, I was extremely impressed
by your essay.

04:16.684 --> 04:19.813
Your passion for our
commander in chief is inspiring.

04:19.978 --> 04:23.608
But I couldn't help feeling
you were one good sentence away.

04:24.859 --> 04:28.530
Duper, the president will be coming
to your house for dinner.

04:28.696 --> 04:30.490
No, it's not fair.

04:30.657 --> 04:33.326
Stan, go to the quiet area.

04:34.035 --> 04:36.497
It's not milk time.

04:47.883 --> 04:50.678
- Roger, what's going on?
- Steve. Good, you're here.

04:50.845 --> 04:54.223
I've been up all night.
Sit down. I've got news.

04:54.932 --> 04:56.768
I figured out how to buy Dollywood.

04:56.935 --> 05:01.273
There's a $50 million reward for Osama
bin Laden, and I know where he is.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.816
What? Yeah, right.

05:02.983 --> 05:05.777
I'm serious. Look,
there's coded messages everywhere.

05:05.944 --> 05:08.071
<i>In the New York Times,
on the internet.</i>

05:08.238 --> 05:10.699
<i>Even in Catcher in the Rye.
Filthy, filthy book.</i>

05:10.866 --> 05:13.243
Well, you did use
an awful lot of string.

05:13.410 --> 05:18.583
Yes. He's posing as a junior accountant
at MacMillan & Sachs right here in DC.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.794
I even have his home address:
17 Lake Drive.

05:21.961 --> 05:24.756
Roger, this is incredible.
We can save America.

05:24.922 --> 05:27.341
And its Zionist allies.
But even better...

05:27.508 --> 05:30.553
...we can use the $50 million reward
to buy Dollywood.

05:30.720 --> 05:36.184
And get girls. Chicks dig a guy with
a fatwa on his head. I'll go tell my dad.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.103
Let's just keep this between us.

05:38.270 --> 05:41.607
I don't wanna have to go threesies
on the reward money.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.860
Hello, White House?
We've found Bin Laden.

05:45.027 --> 05:48.030
Hello? Bitch hung up on me.

05:50.741 --> 05:54.703
It should be me eating dinner
with the president right now, not Duper.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.622
You! This is all your fault.

05:56.789 --> 06:00.376
If you hadn't come home late with
booze, this wouldn't have happened.

06:00.543 --> 06:02.754
I told you, that flask wasn't mine.

06:02.921 --> 06:04.506
- Liar.
- Where?

06:04.672 --> 06:09.385
Oh, I thought you said "fire."
I've had water in my ear all day.

06:09.552 --> 06:12.639
You know what? I don't even care
any more. I'm through with you.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.308
You are a lost cause.

06:15.475 --> 06:18.186
Lost cause?
What an awful thing to say.

06:18.353 --> 06:20.689
It's nice to know
what you really think of me.

06:20.856 --> 06:23.234
You know what? I'm out of here.

06:23.692 --> 06:25.486
Howdy.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.488
President Bush?

06:37.039 --> 06:38.707
But I don't understand, sir.

06:38.874 --> 06:41.294
- I thought Duper won the essay contest.
- He did.

06:41.461 --> 06:44.798
But then we discovered he plagiarized
a chunk of it from Willy Wonka.

06:44.965 --> 06:48.427
Please, come in.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Francine.

06:48.593 --> 06:50.595
- Hello.
- My son, Steve.

06:50.762 --> 06:55.267
Holy fuck.
We just tried to call you. Don't move.

06:55.434 --> 06:57.102
And who's this lovely young lady?

06:57.269 --> 06:59.938
Oh, my daughter, Hayley.
She was just leaving.

07:00.105 --> 07:04.026
I'm not going anywhere. Mr. President,
there's so much I wanna ask you.

07:04.193 --> 07:06.571
Like how in the hell...

07:06.738 --> 07:08.740
As I was saying, how in the hell...

07:08.906 --> 07:11.617
Is dinner not ready yet?
Great final question, Hayley.

07:11.784 --> 07:14.245
Francine, get dinner ready.
The president's hungry.

07:14.412 --> 07:17.957
You're gonna love my wife's cooking,
sir. Her desserts are to die for.

07:18.124 --> 07:20.460
Actually, I didn't
make a dessert tonight.

07:20.626 --> 07:24.673
Is exactly what you would say
if we were getting a divorce tomorrow.

07:24.840 --> 07:28.093
There she goes.
How about a tour, Mr. President?

07:28.260 --> 07:31.847
Make it quick. You've got to prepare
for your early press conference.

07:32.014 --> 07:34.892
I got plenty of time.
I already took my bath.

07:35.058 --> 07:37.978
Wait. I have a question about Iraq.

07:40.522 --> 07:43.109
- I had that one extended.
- This isn't over.

07:43.943 --> 07:45.779
Trap door.

07:46.404 --> 07:48.823
And this is my most prized possession.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.326
An exact replica
of your cheerleading outfit...

07:51.493 --> 07:54.037
...from Andover, your old prep school.

08:01.336 --> 08:03.172
Oh, my God.
Steve said you were here.

08:03.339 --> 08:05.925
Mr. President, I have something
important to show you.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.968
I hope you brought your checkbook.

08:08.135 --> 08:11.847
- That's our maid.
- Oh, fun. I love Mexicans.

08:12.014 --> 08:14.016
Some say they're essential
to our economy.

08:14.183 --> 08:18.521
Others say they're a drain on resources.
All I know is, burritos are delicious.

08:18.687 --> 08:21.899
Stan. The President. Dinner.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.194
Actually, Stan,
I'll meet you downstairs.

08:24.361 --> 08:28.990
- I've got some legislation I need to pass.
- I don't understand.

08:29.157 --> 08:32.034
I have a justice
I need to push through.

08:32.202 --> 08:34.203
For the Supreme Court?
Is there a vacancy?

08:34.371 --> 08:36.832
- I gotta poop, Stan.
- Oh, all right, okay, gotcha.

08:36.998 --> 08:38.667
Hayley.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.503
Your one mistake was leaving me alive.

08:41.669 --> 08:45.133
Now, I have a question
for the president about Iraq.

08:45.883 --> 08:48.136
What the hell, man?

08:48.302 --> 08:49.929
Just something to help her relax.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.307
She was clearly nervous
about meeting her hero.

08:54.475 --> 08:58.020
Oh, there's already a guy in here.
No, that's just a mirror.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.822
Francine, this roast is terrific
and your get-up is beautiful.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.493
Not every day
you have the president to dinner.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.246
All my regular clothes felt silly.

09:14.413 --> 09:17.082
So can you make Tony Blair
do whatever you want?

09:17.249 --> 09:20.127
Like, if you told him to eat a bug,
he'd have to eat a bug?

09:20.294 --> 09:23.130
Like, any type of bug?
A bug with a lot of legs?

09:23.297 --> 09:25.340
That's right, Stan.

09:30.722 --> 09:32.807
- Meet me in the attic.
- Pardon, junior?

09:32.974 --> 09:37.187
I have something big
you'll wanna get your hands on.

09:37.353 --> 09:40.732
I'll get the ice cream à la mode.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.817
Blood for oil.

09:42.984 --> 09:45.904
Sounds like somebody needs
their after-dinner walk.

09:46.071 --> 09:50.534
Steve, help me put your sister in
the pit of no return. We'll be right back.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.086
An autographed George Brett baseball?

10:01.128 --> 10:02.379
Come back here, baseball.

10:04.924 --> 10:06.300
Baseball.

10:07.218 --> 10:08.762
Sit down, Mr. President.

10:08.929 --> 10:12.724
I am about to tell you something
that will change the face of history.

10:12.891 --> 10:15.602
Sure thing, maid.
Baseball seems to take a shine to you.

10:15.769 --> 10:18.438
Your long search
for the terrorist mastermind...

10:18.605 --> 10:21.733
...who is responsible for tormenting
our nation is about...

10:21.900 --> 10:25.153
Where are my manners? Would you
like a snack? Have a Dolly Pocket.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.075
They're Hot Pockets
I stuffed with rhinestones.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.452
Oh, my God. You're choking.

10:31.619 --> 10:33.746
I'll get you something
to drink right away.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.059
Now for your drink.

10:58.147 --> 11:01.650
- This is gin.
- Oh, my mistake.

11:02.609 --> 11:05.863
This is Scotch.
I quit alcohol 15 years ago.

11:06.029 --> 11:08.449
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

11:08.615 --> 11:10.827
I feel light-headed.

11:10.994 --> 11:13.037
Here, drink this.

11:14.456 --> 11:18.418
Don't look at me. That's tap water.
Oh, wait, that was vodka.

11:18.585 --> 11:20.795
Mr. President? Mr. President?

11:20.962 --> 11:23.965
- Francine, is the president with you?
- Who? Klaus?

11:24.132 --> 11:26.426
- No, the president.
- Klaus is here with me.

11:26.593 --> 11:30.096
I'm in here, Stan. I'm fine. Thank you.

11:30.263 --> 11:32.892
Oh, thank God. Mr. President.

11:33.309 --> 11:36.145
You escaped the pit of no return?
How did you get past my...

11:36.312 --> 11:38.856
- They're all dead, Dad.
- Even the younglings?

11:39.023 --> 11:41.817
- I made you a wallet out of their hides.
- No!

11:41.984 --> 11:45.279
Oh, a change pocket. That's nice.
What did you make this out of? No!

11:45.446 --> 11:48.199
My younglings.

11:52.119 --> 11:55.499
My wife would run me over with a car
if she knew I was drinking again.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.795
I think I hear your testicles.
Yeah, you hear that?

11:59.961 --> 12:05.759
"Save us. We're in the first lady's purse
and it's dark and smells like peppermint."

12:08.845 --> 12:14.560
Boy, this is the first time I've relaxed
since I took office, and it feels good.

12:14.727 --> 12:18.231
Mr. President, what are you doing?
You're a recovering alcoholic.

12:18.397 --> 12:21.943
I've recovered my sense of fun
is what I've recovered.

12:23.236 --> 12:27.281
My finger's not a gun.
Everybody, do the Skull and Bones.

12:30.034 --> 12:32.161
Oh, my God.

12:32.328 --> 12:34.748
- How dare you gloat at this?
- What do you expect?

12:34.915 --> 12:36.708
I'm a lost cause, remember?

12:36.875 --> 12:39.920
Hey, look at me. I'm a TV antenna.

12:40.087 --> 12:42.464
Am I getting good reception?
Can you see the game?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.925
Coffee! I'll get you coffee.
How do you take it?

12:45.092 --> 12:48.554
Stan, I like my coffee
like my secretaries of state.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.889
Not too dark, and a little sweet.

12:52.433 --> 12:56.938
- Did you tell him about Osama?
- What? Oh, no. We started drinking.

12:57.105 --> 13:00.817
Quick. Coffee. The president's
off his ass. We have to sober him up.

13:00.984 --> 13:03.695
Oh, my God. Here.
Here's some breakfast blend.

13:03.862 --> 13:07.073
The president falls off the wagon
after 15 years of clean living...

13:07.240 --> 13:09.075
...and you wanna serve
breakfast blend?

13:09.242 --> 13:12.287
Breakfast blend? That could work.
Where are the filters?

13:12.454 --> 13:14.581
- Above the sink.
- Above the sink.

13:14.748 --> 13:16.876
Above the sink?
Oh, yeah. Here they are.

13:17.042 --> 13:21.130
Wake up, you drunk. You were
supposed to tell him we found Osama.

13:21.297 --> 13:23.382
- Where's the president?
- He wanted to party.

13:23.549 --> 13:24.884
Hayley snuck him the back.

13:25.050 --> 13:29.054
She wanted me to tell you something.
What was it? What was it.

13:29.221 --> 13:33.350
Oh, yeah, she said she's gonna
bring down the presidency.

13:35.728 --> 13:37.981
Hayley. Mr. President.

13:38.148 --> 13:42.110
Damn it. Where would Hayley
take a drunken president?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.492
Hole in one. Victory swig.

13:53.955 --> 13:56.166
- Sir, come with me.
- He doesn't have to go.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.585
Yeah, I wanna golf.

13:57.752 --> 14:00.588
<i>I wanna golf</i>

14:01.964 --> 14:04.884
<i>I wanna golf</i>

14:05.551 --> 14:08.971
Twisted Sister, man.
Come on. Do the Skull and Bones.

14:12.767 --> 14:16.854
- Good lord. He's more liquor than man.
- This is what the internet was made for.

14:17.021 --> 14:19.316
Hey, check it out.

14:19.483 --> 14:20.984
- Look, Mr. President.
- Touch it.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.904
- Sir, you are very drunk, and you have...
- Touch it.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.740
You've got a press conference
in the morning and...

14:26.907 --> 14:28.534
Touch it!

14:31.412 --> 14:35.666
Sir, we need to sober you up. Get me
some cold water to splash on his face.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.796
Cold water? Great idea. Pool hopping.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.094
I'm not sure we should try
and bring Bin Laden in by ourselves.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.762
Steve, we don't have a choice.

14:47.929 --> 14:51.307
No one will listen, and you got
too drunk to tell the president.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.977
- What? It wasn't me who...
- Enough with the past.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.895
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

14:56.062 --> 15:00.943
I will be after I hear the sobering wisdom
of Miss Dolly Parton.

15:16.167 --> 15:19.044
Look at me. I'm running unopposed.

15:20.630 --> 15:21.923
No pool.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.385
- Nope.
- I can't believe it.

15:25.552 --> 15:27.179
This is a national disaster.

15:27.345 --> 15:30.599
We should call FEMA. They can
rescue him in four or five days.

15:30.766 --> 15:32.517
I am sick of your snide comments.

15:32.684 --> 15:35.270
President Bush is a good man
and you're a liar.

15:35.437 --> 15:37.606
I told you, that rum wasn't mine.

15:37.773 --> 15:40.317
Lies. It's like you have to lie to live.

15:40.484 --> 15:42.945
You're a lie-abetic.
You have lie-abetes.

15:43.112 --> 15:45.656
Twice a day,
you take a shot of insu-lying.

15:45.823 --> 15:47.867
Dad, Bush is gone.

15:50.286 --> 15:53.790
All right. 17 Lake Drive.
This is where Osama's living.

15:53.956 --> 15:57.293
We have to gain his trust
so he invites us into his home.

15:57.460 --> 16:00.546
So remember your lines
and don't break character.

16:00.713 --> 16:03.217
- Yes?
- Get him.

16:07.930 --> 16:10.766
I could live in the sea.
I'd make friends with a whale.

16:10.933 --> 16:14.603
We'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
That'd show global warming.

16:16.355 --> 16:17.397
Howdy.

16:18.482 --> 16:20.901
I don't wanna wear a suit.
I wanna be naked.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.402
Sir, please don't fight me.

16:22.569 --> 16:25.949
- I wanna be naked.
- Let the man be naked.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.118
Stop doing that.

16:31.871 --> 16:35.333
Look at him clear that fence.
Didn't even scrape his junk.

16:36.793 --> 16:40.130
Where are you hiding Osama?
We broke the code. We know he's here.

16:40.296 --> 16:43.800
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a med student at Georgetown.

16:43.967 --> 16:48.097
Well, terrorist, you leave us no choice.
We will now torture you...

16:48.264 --> 16:50.975
...in my backless chair.

16:51.142 --> 16:53.018
- That's a stool.
- It's a backless chair.

16:53.185 --> 16:54.895
Don't diminish my invention.

16:56.105 --> 16:59.817
- Can't catch this doggie.
- Mr. President, stop.

17:06.366 --> 17:10.119
- You've got to put on your clothes.
- You can't make me. I want pancakes.

17:10.287 --> 17:13.707
We have to get you home. You have
a press conference in four hours.

17:13.874 --> 17:17.627
Oh, who gives a frog's fat ass?
I didn't sign up for this.

17:17.794 --> 17:22.132
I was a frat dude who owned
a baseball team. Life was fun.

17:22.299 --> 17:25.510
But now I've got
all this responsibility and pressure.

17:25.676 --> 17:28.013
Maybe I ought to quit
this whole president thing.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.058
- What?
- Oh, I've seen my approval ratings.

17:31.225 --> 17:34.812
Truth is, Stan,
America just don't like me no more.

17:34.979 --> 17:39.108
Sir, don't say that. This country
loves you. This country needs you.

17:39.275 --> 17:44.405
I appreciate that, Stan,
but I think it's time for me to hang it up.

17:44.572 --> 17:47.451
- Love it. Love everything about it.
- I should call Cheney.

17:47.618 --> 17:51.205
Let him know he'll be taking the reins.
This isn't my cell phone.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.583
You're wearing my jacket, sir.
That's the essay I wrote.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.086
"Not since Reagan has a leader...

17:57.252 --> 18:00.547
...so perfectly embodied
the American ideal."

18:00.714 --> 18:04.301
- You really think so?
- Of course. Didn't you read my essay?

18:04.468 --> 18:06.720
No, I got a girl
who reads things for me.

18:06.887 --> 18:09.349
Oh, well, then, may I?

18:09.516 --> 18:13.895
"He doesn't make his decision on polls,
expert opinion or even facts...

18:14.062 --> 18:16.439
...for Almighty God is his copilot...

18:16.606 --> 18:20.026
...and in November 2000,
he was cleared for takeoff."

18:20.193 --> 18:23.780
- Oh, please. That is just...
- Beautiful. Read some more.

18:23.947 --> 18:26.116
Not until you put on your pants.

18:28.327 --> 18:31.580
Not easy, is it?
Sitting there for minutes on end...

18:31.747 --> 18:33.457
...with zero lumbar support.

18:33.624 --> 18:37.044
I'm getting used to it. You know,
in the Third World countries...

18:37.211 --> 18:39.505
...most people don't sit in chairs.
They squat...

18:39.672 --> 18:41.549
- Enough.
- What the hell?

18:41.715 --> 18:44.009
Tell me where Bin Laden is
or I'll kill the boy.

18:44.176 --> 18:46.554
- Roger!
- Don't think I'll do it? I wanna do it.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.973
Give it up. You're wrong, okay?

18:49.141 --> 18:53.145
Danny doesn't know where Bin Laden is
because Bin Laden doesn't live in DC.

18:53.311 --> 18:56.648
And he doesn't work as an accountant
at MacMillan & Sachs.

18:56.815 --> 19:00.527
But the code. I was so sure.

19:00.819 --> 19:05.073
I guess I wanted Dollywood so bad,
I was willing to believe anything.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.701
What am I gonna do now?

19:09.828 --> 19:12.039
You know, Danny,
I think I'm gonna rob you.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.961
"The love and respect I have for you
knows no limits."

19:17.128 --> 19:19.922
"I long to caress your..."

19:20.089 --> 19:23.968
My what? My what? Is that it?
Is that how it ends?

19:24.135 --> 19:26.179
- It has no end.
- Oh.

19:26.345 --> 19:29.348
Just like the legacy
of George W. Bush.

19:29.515 --> 19:33.645
Wow, now that is awesome.
I can't thank you enough.

19:33.812 --> 19:36.023
I was really starting to doubt myself.

19:36.190 --> 19:39.193
But knowing you feel this way
has turned me right around.

19:39.359 --> 19:41.361
It's been my honor, sir.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.740
That's very touching,
but none of that's gonna matter...

19:44.907 --> 19:47.034
...when Jon Stewart gets a hold of this.

19:47.201 --> 19:49.703
Hayley, me and Exmack
wanna keep partying...

19:49.870 --> 19:53.792
...but the liquor stores are closed.
You got your flask on you?

19:53.958 --> 19:56.961
- That was your flask.
- Great, you got me.

19:57.128 --> 20:00.131
I guess you were right.
I'm just a lost cause.

20:00.298 --> 20:04.469
Wait a minute. Stan,
you told her she was a lost cause?

20:04.636 --> 20:09.432
Sir, she's been nothing but trouble.
She stays out late, she lies, she drinks.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.393
Those things don't make
your daughter a lost cause.

20:12.561 --> 20:17.066
Look at me. When I was her age,
I was blitzed off my ass 24/7.

20:17.233 --> 20:21.445
Doing tequila shots, Jell-O shooters,
Cement Mixers, Dr. Pepper Bombs...

20:21.612 --> 20:23.948
...Mud Slides, Kamikazes, Jägeritas...

20:24.115 --> 20:27.993
...Lemon Drops, B-52s, Fuzzy Navels,
Gorilla Farts, Scorpion Bowls...

20:28.160 --> 20:31.747
...Singapore Slings, Prairie Fires,
Bloody Marys, Slippery Nipples.

20:31.914 --> 20:34.960
Point is, no matter how much
I messed up... Flaming Everclears.

20:35.127 --> 20:39.297
No matter how much I messed up,
my daddy always believed in me.

20:39.464 --> 20:42.175
Heck, Stan,
your daughter's not a lost cause.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.095
She's right on track to be president.

20:47.848 --> 20:51.560
I never looked at it like that.
I guess I have been a little hard on you.

20:51.726 --> 20:54.814
Well, I'm sorry I lied.

20:54.981 --> 20:57.150
Thanks for standing up for me,
President Bush.

20:57.316 --> 21:00.528
You're welcome, darling.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

21:00.695 --> 21:03.197
...I have a press conference
to stammer through.

21:03.364 --> 21:05.741
That means he has to poop.

21:10.746 --> 21:13.332
Well, I guess he's better than Cheney.

21:17.754 --> 21:21.550
- Sorry about your Redskins on Sunday.
- Next week, next week.

21:21.717 --> 21:25.554
- Bilbo. We still on for drinks after work?
- You know it, Ted.

21:25.721 --> 21:29.475
- How you like your new house?
- Better than the one on Lake Drive.

21:29.641 --> 21:33.896
- Bill, I need those reports by 4.
- You got it, sir.

21:36.983 --> 21:40.653
Except there won't be a 4.

21:41.613 --> 21:43.114
- You okay, Bill?
- Yeah.

21:43.281 --> 21:46.159
Just can't get PowerPoint to open.

21:46.326 --> 21:48.119
Bye-bye. See you soon.

21:50.121 --> 21:52.207
