WEBVTT

00:02.129 --> 00:04.200
E. R.

00:04.301 --> 00:05.760
Previously on E. R.

00:05.761 --> 00:07.502
Do you wanna do something?

00:07.503 --> 00:09.144
- Like, go out?
- Yeah.

00:09.145 --> 00:12.095
If Mom wants to walk around in
a bubble for the rest of her life, fine.

00:12.096 --> 00:14.595
But don't let her keep holding you
inside of it.

00:14.696 --> 00:16.411
I know what won't make him happy.

00:16.512 --> 00:19.733
A made-up life. He's gonna figure it out.
He's not stupid.

00:19.768 --> 00:21.156
I'm not pregnant.

00:21.357 --> 00:24.481
The DNA analysis shows
that I'm not Reece's biological father.

00:24.682 --> 00:27.344
Reece lived under my care
and my roof for most of his life.

00:27.545 --> 00:30.189
All I'm asking for is some kind
of arrangement that recognizes that.

00:30.290 --> 00:31.754
- Do you wanna keep your son?
- What do you think?

00:31.855 --> 00:35.620
That you need to start setting priorities
and making some hard choices.

00:36.116 --> 00:39.065
E.R. 8x10 "I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS"

00:40.772 --> 00:42.015
The Phoenix Suns.

00:42.088 --> 00:42.931
Is that a crime?

00:43.004 --> 00:47.047
- You root for the Phoenix Suns?
- I paid attention to basketball there.

00:47.119 --> 00:50.381
- You grew up in Chicago.
- I dated a guy with tickets.

00:50.409 --> 00:54.848
- You didn't pay attention to the Bulls?
- Whatever. I'm starving.

00:55.016 --> 00:57.338
Big Diamondbacks fan too, aren't you?

00:57.515 --> 01:01.294
- I'm gonna get breakfast out of this deal.
- Sorry. My manners.

01:01.472 --> 01:03.212
- Roach coach?
- You live in a mansion...

01:03.387 --> 01:06.384
- ... you're buying me a doughnut?
- I'll spring for the coffee too.

01:06.553 --> 01:08.708
Hey there, big spender.

01:10.301 --> 01:11.959
- Hello.
- John, it's Dad.

01:12.134 --> 01:14.917
- Hey. How was your flight?
- How's Gamma doing?

01:15.091 --> 01:18.176
Yeah. No, she was walking around
a little bit yesterday.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.415
- Great.
- I meet her for lunch.

01:19.589 --> 01:22.870
- You wanna hook up there?
- You're getting me a yogurt too.

01:23.046 --> 01:25.249
What's that? Grab me a bagel.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.500
- ...for the holiday.
- Really.

01:28.918 --> 01:31.038
- No, that's great.
- See you at the house.

01:31.209 --> 01:34.739
- Yeah, okay. I'll see you there.
- Bye.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.070
- They' re staying for the holidays.
- Your parents?

01:39.247 --> 01:41.284
First time in nine years.

01:41.455 --> 01:43.112
- Just like sex, isn't it, Peter?
- What?

01:43.246 --> 01:47.238
Vascular surgery. Messy, fun,
and when done right, you leave satisfied.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.014
D5 half-normal, 125 cc's per hour.

01:50.387 --> 01:52.042
- Surgery.
- Real good hands in there, Peter.

01:52.377 --> 01:53.215
Thank you.

01:53.255 --> 01:56.335
Which is why you get to assist me
in the Millburn surgery.

01:56.504 --> 01:59.454
Fifth District alderman wants his
cardiac bypass done here.

01:59.586 --> 02:00.615
Why?

02:00.751 --> 02:03.582
The correct response is,
"Thanks, Dr. Romano. I'm honored."

02:03.750 --> 02:05.741
- I am-
- Clear his calendar for Monday afternoon.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.451
- I need to talk.
- He's on trauma call in the ER.

02:08.624 --> 02:11.490
Dump that on Corday.
She actually likes it down there.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.234
- I have a situation with my son.
- What else is new?

02:14.413 --> 02:17.441
- I need more flexible hours.
- In by 12, out by 4...

02:17.476 --> 02:19.318
and we all make the evening news.

02:19.353 --> 02:21.122
I'm not just talking about this surgery.

02:21.157 --> 02:24.652
If you're not interested, Peter, pass.
I've got 20 guys who'd kill for this gig.

02:24.824 --> 02:28.106
- I didn't say I wasn't interested-
- So are you in or out?

02:29.657 --> 02:32.818
- I'm in.
- Did I ever tell you you're my hero?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.044 --> 03:25.324
Merry Christmas!

03:27.757 --> 03:31.127
- Feed the poor? Feed the poor?
- Sorry.

03:31.302 --> 03:33.770
- Hey, feed the poor?
- Sorry.

03:33.805 --> 03:37.516
Come on. You think it's easy being
a female Santa in a man's world?

03:37.684 --> 03:40.093
Sorry, no soliciting.
You have to leave the premises.

03:40.270 --> 03:44.269
- I work for the Salvation Army.
- Oh, do you? Let me see your ID.

03:44.442 --> 03:47.444
- Okay, I eat at the Salvation Army.
- Get out of here. Hey!

03:47.613 --> 03:50.186
I'm gonna call the cops.
Stop ringing that damn bell!

03:51.117 --> 03:52.694
- Luka, you're late.
- Sorry.

03:53.328 --> 03:57.077
Don't be sorry, be punctual.
This is a hospital, not a department store.

03:57.248 --> 03:59.159
When's she going on Christmas vacation?

03:59.335 --> 04:01.222
Scrooge? Never.

04:02.005 --> 04:04.122
Merry Christmas. County General.

04:04.357 --> 04:06.309
I think she thinks you were shopping.

04:06.344 --> 04:07.754
Shopping for what?

04:08.596 --> 04:10.173
It's a joke.

04:11.349 --> 04:12.547
What's going on?

04:12.725 --> 04:15.431
I went to the bar.
No one's heard anything.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.522
- About Nicole?
- Yeah.

04:17.689 --> 04:20.062
They said she took money there too.

04:23.279 --> 04:26.614
Guess you were right.
She lied about everything.

04:28.578 --> 04:32.362
Hey, Abby. Can you run
Cynthia Cohen's sputum?

04:32.624 --> 04:36.289
I got a couple of kids with
snow-related injuries! Quiet!

04:36.461 --> 04:40.923
- Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak-
- Hey! Shut up! Both of you, shut up!

04:41.092 --> 04:45.192
Be glad you're not sleeping in a grate
or eating out of the trash!

04:45.723 --> 04:47.550
- Haleh, get them out of here.
- Stop!

04:47.725 --> 04:51.639
- You, this side. You, over here.
- Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak...

04:51.813 --> 04:55.808
Since when did Fire and Rescue start
transporting pediatric walk-in cases?

04:55.984 --> 04:58.772
Since these two took headers
out by the firehouse.

04:58.905 --> 05:02.737
- You notify the parents?
- Yeah, I left word.

05:02.909 --> 05:04.819
- Hey, you didn't call.
- Sorry?

05:04.995 --> 05:07.851
About getting together.
You change your mind?

05:07.886 --> 05:10.782
- No, I was just-
- Dr. Weaver, Exam 1 has chest pains.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.165
- Be right there.
- Dynamic changes on the EKG.

05:14.673 --> 05:16.665
I'll let you get back to work, okay?

05:18.261 --> 05:22.175
Three nitro sprays
and titrate six of morphine.

05:22.515 --> 05:26.592
Cops found him wandering around O'Hare
with a suitcase but no ticket and no ID.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.178
He fell on the escalator
trying to get away.

05:29.356 --> 05:31.313
I'm missing my flight.

05:31.484 --> 05:33.276
Lacerations down to the galea.

05:33.445 --> 05:35.853
I go home for Christmas every year,
I think.

05:36.031 --> 05:40.193
- Looks intact. No sign of fracture.
- Which doesn't explain the amnesia.

05:40.369 --> 05:42.197
Doesn't know who he is,
where he's going.

05:42.372 --> 05:44.495
I know there's lots of kids around.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.954
And the women make
a wonderful supper.

05:47.126 --> 05:49.035
Blood supply looks good.

05:49.212 --> 05:53.210
Well, Plastics should be able
to tack it back down.

05:53.384 --> 05:55.543
We still need to get a head CT.

05:55.720 --> 06:01.094
Boys and the men, they settle
around the TV watching sports.

06:01.268 --> 06:04.020
You think his memory loss is temporary?

06:06.067 --> 06:07.310
Peter?

06:07.483 --> 06:08.563
He's 4 years old.

06:08.694 --> 06:11.398
And deaf and traumatized by
the death of his mother.

06:11.531 --> 06:14.901
- I emphasized all of that. Thank you.
- Well, then appeal it.

06:15.077 --> 06:17.568
- I can't.
- What am I paying you for?

06:17.746 --> 06:20.748
He denied the motion, Peter.
It's not irreparable.

06:20.917 --> 06:25.083
The hell it isn't. He's asking my son
to decide which of us loves him more?

06:25.254 --> 06:26.583
It won't be that specific.

06:26.756 --> 06:29.081
Will he ask who makes
better macaroni and cheese?

06:29.551 --> 06:34.890
Judge Alter has a feeling that interviewing
Reece will provide relevant insight.

06:35.057 --> 06:37.383
Reece knows what's going on.
He can sense it.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.886
How much more damage
do you want to inflict on him?

06:41.189 --> 06:44.975
Hey, I agreed to represent you.
You're the one who's choosing to fight.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.273
You can preempt this.
His attorney approached me yesterday.

06:48.447 --> 06:50.940
- No.
- They'll make a revised visitation request.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.398
I said, no.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.824
And I need to be honest.

06:58.167 --> 07:02.380
We don't have the edge here. On paper,
Roger comes across as the better father.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.963
If I were his attorney, I would advise him
to give you no more deals.

07:06.095 --> 07:07.801
Yet you're advising me
to accept one?

07:07.970 --> 07:11.470
I am advising you to
at least listen to one.

07:13.811 --> 07:17.477
- You're still here.
- I was on my way out.

07:17.648 --> 07:19.389
Keep those kids from killing each other?

07:19.476 --> 07:21.651
Yeah. One has a corneal abrasion...

07:21.820 --> 07:25.071
...the other has a strained wrist.
Look, hey...

07:25.240 --> 07:30.616
- I'm not very good at this.
- What, follow-up?

07:30.997 --> 07:33.155
Want to have lunch tomorrow?

07:34.836 --> 07:36.292
- No sushi.
- What?

07:36.462 --> 07:39.713
- I don't like sushi.
- Okay. Anything you want.

07:39.882 --> 07:42.455
I'm gonna remember you said that.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.550
Why is he here?
Somebody finally kick his butt?

07:45.723 --> 07:47.680
- Who?
- Mr. Karaoke over there.

07:47.850 --> 07:52.098
- How about a little "Jingle Bell Rock"?
- You know him?

07:52.272 --> 07:56.022
Oh, yeah, Stan? He lives behind
a dumpster on 57th and Dorchester.

07:56.194 --> 07:59.029
- He's homeless?
- Unless you count the dumpster.

07:59.197 --> 08:02.032
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:03.827 --> 08:05.835
- Where you going?
- Whatever that lady...

08:05.870 --> 08:07.428
...told you, it's not true.

08:07.463 --> 08:09.465
- Your name isn't Stan?
- No, no, no.

08:09.542 --> 08:13.791
- You don't live at 57th and Dorchester?
- I don't remember. That's why I'm here.

08:15.172 --> 08:18.958
Besides, this Stan character sounds rough.
Bet he's got a record.

08:19.553 --> 08:22.555
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- And no family to speak of.

08:22.725 --> 08:26.344
- No place to spend the holidays.
- You know, if he was smart...

08:26.521 --> 08:29.854
...he'd clean himself up,
get himself a suit at the Goodwill-

08:30.023 --> 08:32.049
And go to the airport.

08:32.193 --> 08:36.522
You mind if I stay a while?
It's kind of Christmassy here.

08:36.697 --> 08:40.364
The alderman thinks you're such
a brilliant surgeon, then you operate.

08:40.537 --> 08:42.576
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.575
Hey. What's going on?

08:45.541 --> 08:48.828
- Waiting for Roger and his lawyer.
- I thought we were seeing the judge.

08:49.004 --> 08:52.089
- We're hoping that won't be necessary.
- Peter, what's going on?

08:52.258 --> 08:57.004
- They wanna talk about some kind of deal.
- Sorry we're late. We ran into traffic.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.424
We don't have a lot of time.
What have you got?

08:59.601 --> 09:02.685
Visitation every other weekend,
plus two weeks during the summer.

09:03.271 --> 09:05.561
- One week during the summer.
- No.

09:05.732 --> 09:08.603
- We're only asking for 38 days a year.
-31 days.

09:09.027 --> 09:11.567
- I said, no.
- Peter, it's only 31 days.

09:11.739 --> 09:14.029
- I'm not doing this.
- Peter, listen to me.

09:14.202 --> 09:18.614
No. You listen to me, all of you.
I'm not negotiating over my son.

09:18.997 --> 09:21.240
Rather take your chances
with the judge?

09:21.958 --> 09:26.669
A martini in first class works
just as well and takes less time.

09:26.839 --> 09:32.822
Like you, I enjoy the occasional drive.
Gives you time to clear your head.

09:33.257 --> 09:35.262
- Hey, Dad.
- John.

09:35.434 --> 09:38.057
Did you know your father's
been here since last night?

09:38.230 --> 09:40.470
Late last night.
He went straight to the hotel.

09:40.647 --> 09:44.646
- Oh, God. Am I dying?
- Rigor mortis hasn't set in just yet.

09:44.819 --> 09:48.271
Why else would my son deign
to spend Christmas with us?

09:48.448 --> 09:50.488
Mom's coming too.

09:50.659 --> 09:55.654
- I knew there was a catch.
- Eleanor will be here later this week.

09:55.832 --> 09:58.405
You'll stay at the house until then?

09:58.502 --> 09:59.783
Sure, why not.

09:59.962 --> 10:02.749
Wonderful.
Here's Helga to turn me like a pancake.

10:02.924 --> 10:07.669
- We'll give you some privacy.
- I'd settle for a little dignity.

10:09.931 --> 10:13.182
Believe it or not, she's thrilled.
This means the world to her.

10:13.352 --> 10:16.104
- This year more than most.
- Well, I suppose.

10:16.272 --> 10:18.763
Means a lot to me too.

10:18.943 --> 10:21.648
Yeah. It should be fun, huh?

10:23.531 --> 10:27.196
Reece, I have to make a decision.

10:27.368 --> 10:30.620
I need you to help me
by answering some questions.

10:30.789 --> 10:32.699
Can you do that?

10:37.088 --> 10:38.916
Who's that?

10:44.055 --> 10:45.335
Daddy.

10:47.016 --> 10:49.056
And who's that?

10:50.938 --> 10:52.562
My other daddy.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.898
You love both your daddies
very much, right?

11:04.203 --> 11:05.744
He says he doesn't know.

11:06.581 --> 11:10.709
When you are sick,
who makes you feel better?

11:12.588 --> 11:13.999
Mommy.

11:14.172 --> 11:18.752
Which daddy gives you the best care
when you get a boo-boo?

11:28.524 --> 11:30.349
He has Band-Aids with cartoons.

11:38.546 --> 11:40.705
Right now, I'd say he needs consistency.

11:42.342 --> 11:47.049
Reece, Carla and I.
The three of us were a family.

11:47.721 --> 11:50.391
That's how we planned our lives.

11:50.808 --> 11:54.059
That's how we approached
every day, every week.

11:55.938 --> 12:00.103
I've been with Reece through earaches...

12:00.276 --> 12:04.108
...flus, almost every scrape
he's ever gotten.

12:05.739 --> 12:11.279
If you count the hours
that I've spent with my stepson...

12:11.579 --> 12:16.738
...it far exceeds the time Dr. Benton has
spent with the child he believed to be his.

12:16.916 --> 12:19.788
Reece and Carla were my life.

12:19.962 --> 12:21.705
And now Reece is my life.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.416
He comes first.

12:26.427 --> 12:30.426
Ahead of my personal needs,
ahead of my job.

12:31.515 --> 12:34.266
And I think that's in his best interest.

12:42.568 --> 12:47.063
- Oh, John. Diverse selection.
- Burgers are good.

12:47.238 --> 12:50.608
You already know what you want?
I'm still working on what to drink.

12:52.953 --> 12:55.159
This is nice.
Haven't done this for a while.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.158
Had lunch together? Or Christmas?

12:57.333 --> 12:58.993
Both.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.290
So...

13:02.588 --> 13:06.040
What kind of business keeps Mom
in Costa Rica in December?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.960
How's the chopped salad?

13:11.765 --> 13:16.094
She broke her hip, Dad.
Mom can't spend five minutes with her?

13:16.269 --> 13:18.973
Is she gonna avoid her
for the whole month?

13:19.147 --> 13:22.313
Your mother's not coming.
John, we're getting divorced.

13:25.527 --> 13:28.019
- What? Divorced?
- It's amicable.

13:28.197 --> 13:30.486
After 30 years?

13:34.745 --> 13:37.117
- What happened?
- This probably isn't the best-

13:37.290 --> 13:42.746
- Is there somebody else?
- Neither of us is running off with anyone.

13:44.797 --> 13:48.629
What is it, she's not happy? She's bored?
Wants to stay in Europe?

13:49.885 --> 13:51.961
I'm the one who's leaving, John.

13:52.972 --> 13:55.509
This can't surprise you.
You saw it before I did.

13:56.475 --> 13:59.725
- Can I take your order?
- I was suffocating. I think we're ready.

13:59.895 --> 14:02.268
Chopped salad, please.

14:03.982 --> 14:06.438
Burger medium-rare, please.

14:09.279 --> 14:14.985
I agree with Mr. McGrath that consistency
is the best thing for Reece right now.

14:15.954 --> 14:18.028
See, I...

14:18.288 --> 14:22.951
I let Carla take on a lot of the parenting
while I pursued my career.

14:23.227 --> 14:28.866
But I did that because it felt right
to leave Reece in his mother's care.

14:31.052 --> 14:33.459
But all that's changed now.

14:34.472 --> 14:37.556
And my responsibilities
have changed too.

14:37.725 --> 14:41.888
Because of that I've made arrangements
to work fewer hours...

14:42.062 --> 14:45.228
...so I can become Reece's
full-time caretaker.

14:45.399 --> 14:48.649
- At County General?
- Yes, sir.

14:48.819 --> 14:51.025
What sort of hour reduction
are we talking about?

14:51.364 --> 14:54.318
7 a. m. to 5 p. m. weekdays,
weekends off.

14:54.741 --> 14:57.577
You can provide proof
of this new schedule?

14:58.413 --> 15:00.451
Yes, sir. Yes, I can.

15:00.955 --> 15:03.198
Have it in my office by day's end.

15:04.293 --> 15:08.422
Unless there is anything else,
court's adjourned.

15:08.590 --> 15:11.425
I need to talk to him now.
Well, pull him out.

15:11.593 --> 15:14.131
Fine. Let him know I'm on my way.

15:17.848 --> 15:19.925
- Going back to work?
- Get out of my way.

15:20.101 --> 15:22.508
- Got another shift?
- Roger, get out of my way!

15:22.687 --> 15:28.026
Where's Reece? Let me guess: Jackie.
No, Cleo. A nanny?

15:29.736 --> 15:32.772
- You want me to hit your car?
- You lied, man.

15:32.947 --> 15:35.522
On top of everything else, you're a liar.
And a perjurer.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.573
You know what? You need to back off.

15:39.454 --> 15:43.451
Whatever it takes, is that it?
He's not a trophy, man!

15:43.625 --> 15:46.994
You can't win at any cost
to give your sister a son!

15:47.129 --> 15:48.705
- You gotta raise him!
- You know-

15:48.879 --> 15:51.501
Go ahead, get in my face. Come on.

15:51.674 --> 15:56.301
- Roger, you need to shut your mouth.
- Think, Peter.

15:57.637 --> 15:59.796
You can't change who you are.

16:02.312 --> 16:07.428
I'm sure it was on this block.
It's called Nazim. It's got a blue awning.

16:07.606 --> 16:11.142
- Well, I don't see it.
- We must have missed it.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.734
- I don't like Indian food anyway.
- Why didn't you say something?

16:14.906 --> 16:18.440
- I just did.
- Why don't we go to that Italian place...

16:18.618 --> 16:21.453
- ... across the street. Great risotto.
- Wait a minute.

16:21.620 --> 16:25.488
- That'd be great if it weren't closed.
- You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

16:25.666 --> 16:28.585
- Well, some say.
- I'm starting to regret this whole thing.

16:28.753 --> 16:33.629
- Too bad. I'm starving.
- Forget about looking for a decent place.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.963
- Why don't we go home and order in.
- I like a take-charge kind of girl.

16:38.137 --> 16:41.173
- My apartment?
- Lead the way.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.184
- Dr. Romano.
- You hear something?

16:45.353 --> 16:49.351
- I need to talk to you.
- That's a doctor who breaks promises...

16:49.523 --> 16:52.146
...then hangs up on the guy
he breaks the promises with.

16:52.319 --> 16:54.606
- I need to talk to you now.
- Talk is cheap, Peter.

16:54.779 --> 16:57.352
I need to scale back my hours
and I need it in writing.

16:57.532 --> 17:00.367
- "To whom it may concern: No way."
- I'm serious.

17:00.535 --> 17:04.153
- Is this about your kid?
- Yeah.

17:04.329 --> 17:07.035
What do you need?
Every other Saturday?

17:07.917 --> 17:09.790
No nights. No weekends.

17:11.377 --> 17:14.130
Good one. I like the one
about the rabbi and the goldfish.

17:14.298 --> 17:17.333
- I need to spend more time at home.
- Never needed to before.

17:17.509 --> 17:20.464
- His mother died.
- His stepfather is still alive.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.880
Split custody,
keep doing what you do best.

17:23.057 --> 17:24.682
I'm not asking for your advice.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.181
News flash!
This is an urban trauma center.

17:27.354 --> 17:31.351
Until people plan their MVAs and GSWs
better, you won't punch a time clock.

17:31.524 --> 17:34.858
That's not me being a hard-ass,
that's the job. You are a surgeon.

17:35.027 --> 17:37.275
- Are you gonna do this for me or not?
- Not.

17:37.395 --> 17:39.234
Work when I need you or not at all.

17:40.117 --> 17:42.358
Then consider this my resignation.

17:43.244 --> 17:47.821
All right, all right, all right.
Don't go getting dramatic.

17:53.754 --> 17:55.749
- Weekends off.
- And what about weekdays?

17:56.257 --> 17:58.380
It's my best offer, Peter.
Take it or leave it.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.755
I'll finish out the week.

18:05.809 --> 18:11.259
Are you really gonna do this?
Throw away your career to play Mr. Mom?

18:11.564 --> 18:12.894
What a waste!

18:14.776 --> 18:16.981
- Hi.
- Hey. Newborn for the nursery.

18:17.153 --> 18:19.727
- Birth in the ER?
- Marshall Field's.

18:19.906 --> 18:22.314
Mother was last-minute shopping.
She's on her way up.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.860
- The paramedics delivered?
- No, a shoe salesman.

18:37.132 --> 18:40.298
- Room 424, do you have a chart?
- Was she an ER patient?

18:40.469 --> 18:43.304
I just have to follow up on something.

18:49.478 --> 18:53.392
- How far along was she?
- Eight weeks. No complications.

18:53.565 --> 18:56.934
- She's in Recovery for a few more hours.
- Thanks.

18:59.863 --> 19:03.624
- Dr. Finch, please.
- I'm not sure she's here. Let me check.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.489
All right, thanks.

19:10.039 --> 19:13.041
- What are you doing here?
- I need to meet the Surgicenter director.

19:13.168 --> 19:15.576
- You gave him my CV, right?
- Yeah, but-

19:15.754 --> 19:18.540
- I quit County.
- Romano wouldn't give you the hours?

19:18.714 --> 19:21.834
You said there's a position here.
I want it.

19:22.343 --> 19:25.843
- I'll introduce you tomorrow.
- I gotta show proof of employment now.

19:26.097 --> 19:30.011
- Peter, he's probably gone for the day.
- Check, please.

19:30.185 --> 19:35.012
- I just started, he barely knows me.
- Cleo, I need to talk to him.

19:40.694 --> 19:44.692
- Hi. I thought you left.
- Tonight.

19:44.865 --> 19:48.945
Luka has been looking for you.
Could you wait, please?

19:49.119 --> 19:53.034
- Do you need something?
- You told him you weren't pregnant.

19:53.249 --> 19:55.040
- I'm not.
- I don't understand.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.704
You don't need to.

19:57.963 --> 20:02.042
- Look, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- No, you were right.

20:03.176 --> 20:08.716
He did everything he could. I thought
his kindness was love. But it's not.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.643
Abby, he deserves not to know.

20:16.523 --> 20:18.267
Thanks.

20:21.278 --> 20:25.405
Tuesday's impossible.
He's got colorectal procedures then.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.139
Fissurectomy at 7.
Hemorrhoidectomy at 8.

20:29.174 --> 20:30.278
Another at 9.

20:30.369 --> 20:33.656
And it looks like he's squeezed
in an inguinal hernia too.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.619
- Maybe for lunch?
- No, he's got a lunch date.

20:36.793 --> 20:41.085
- After that?
- After that, he sees patients until 5.

20:41.255 --> 20:44.454
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday might work, actually.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.235
Judge Alter! Judge Alter!

20:54.413 --> 20:57.616
I got that employment letter for you.

20:59.084 --> 21:02.915
- I wanted this yesterday.
- I know. It came in after-hours.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.953
- This is not your hospital.
- No.

21:07.131 --> 21:09.917
- Schaumburg Surgicenter?
- I worked out...

21:10.008 --> 21:12.415
a better situation there
than if I had stayed at County.

21:13.970 --> 21:17.338
- All in the last 12 hours?
- It was always a possibility.

21:17.514 --> 21:21.048
- It just needed to be ironed out.
- You didn't mention it yesterday.

21:21.225 --> 21:24.012
I know. I said I'd cut back
my hours and I did.

21:24.186 --> 21:26.676
- True.
- I'm now working 8 to 5, no weekends.

21:26.854 --> 21:28.811
- This letter confirms it.
- That may be so.

21:28.980 --> 21:32.644
But you told a different story yesterday.
And I don't like being lied to.

21:34.191 --> 21:36.433
I'm doing what I have to do for my son.

21:42.615 --> 21:45.983
Hey, Elizabeth. You sneaking coffee?

21:46.159 --> 21:49.158
Tea. You look nice.
Are you going on a date?

21:49.327 --> 21:50.989
No. Court date.

21:52.287 --> 21:57.017
- Right. What's the latest?
- It's out of my hands now.

21:58.001 --> 22:00.416
It's best to keep busy while you wait.

22:00.502 --> 22:04.251
Yeah. Well,
I owe a lot of hours before I go.

22:04.671 --> 22:08.371
- Before you go?
- Yeah. End of the week, I'm out of here.

22:09.133 --> 22:12.086
- What?
- Yeah, I had to quit.

22:14.345 --> 22:17.299
- You're not serious.
- I need to change my life.

22:17.473 --> 22:19.345
Romano won't cut me any slack.

22:20.976 --> 22:23.810
Yeah, but I'm sure he'll make
some accommodation.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.265
No. I asked. He won't.

22:27.188 --> 22:28.930
You'd really leave County?

22:31.023 --> 22:32.850
I gotta go.

22:35.486 --> 22:37.112
- How'd he fall?
- Hanging lights.

22:37.187 --> 22:39.444
Parents are signing him in.

22:39.614 --> 22:41.689
- What do we got?
- Fell from a ladder.

22:41.864 --> 22:43.941
- Parents are here.
- Is he okay?

22:44.075 --> 22:47.111
- Has he been unconscious?
- His sister put the hose on him.

22:47.286 --> 22:49.989
- He woke up for a second.
- Did he hit anything?

22:50.162 --> 22:52.487
- A bike.
- I got some involuntary guarding here.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.122
- He's waking up. That's good, yes?
- Coming through.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.539
- What do we have?
- Possible liver or splenic lac.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.831
- Stable, but might need to go to the O.R.
- HemoCue?

23:04.006 --> 23:06.876
- Second is eight from 10.
- Does your belly hurt?

23:07.050 --> 23:10.051
All right. He's stable for CT.
Control the pain.

23:10.219 --> 23:12.840
- Watch him overnight.
- He has free fluid by ultrasound.

23:12.971 --> 23:15.093
I won't remove the spleen
before we have to.

23:15.265 --> 23:17.222
- Remove?
- He can still live without one.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.757
- I can give him mine.
- That's not necessary.

23:19.934 --> 23:22.934
- Someone'll match.
- We don't transplant spleens.

23:23.103 --> 23:26.600
- I'll show you where the waiting room is.
- We can at least give blood.

23:26.771 --> 23:28.052
- She's going down.
- Amparo!

23:28.232 --> 23:29.891
Ma'am, you okay?

23:30.734 --> 23:33.437
- Have you fainted before?
- Never.

23:38.238 --> 23:40.314
How do you serve
Christmas dinner for them?

23:40.490 --> 23:43.573
Start cooking early. No problem.

23:43.744 --> 23:48.277
O.R.'s got elective cases they can push.
How's she doing?

23:48.453 --> 23:50.575
Please, I'm fine. Tell me about Ben.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.154
His blood counts are stable, that's good.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.872
His first CT only shows a small injury.

23:56.044 --> 23:58.534
His school band plays in a concert
on New Year's Eve.

23:58.712 --> 24:00.205
I don't want him to miss it.

24:01.630 --> 24:04.750
- How long have you had this node?
- I don't know.

24:04.925 --> 24:06.631
Is this tender?

24:06.802 --> 24:09.504
You don't have to examine me
or run tests.

24:09.677 --> 24:11.054
I know I'm sick.

24:12.638 --> 24:14.713
Have you been diagnosed
with something?

24:15.975 --> 24:17.253
Lymphoma.

24:21.602 --> 24:23.310
I'm sorry.

24:25.106 --> 24:28.391
- Don't tell them, though.
- Your family doesn't know?

24:29.441 --> 24:32.691
There will be plenty of time
to talk after Christmas.

24:33.195 --> 24:36.729
Dr. Benton? Janice Prager called.
She wants you to meet her in court.

24:36.906 --> 24:39.775
- Go. I'll get another surgeon.
- Your son will be fine.

24:39.949 --> 24:41.657
Good.

24:43.451 --> 24:47.578
- They got me right in the store.
- It's tough to hide two pairs of skates.

24:47.745 --> 24:50.118
The guard jumped me in front of my kids.

24:50.207 --> 24:51.748
Can we keep the ice skates?

24:51.916 --> 24:53.457
No.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.959
They hate getting used stuff.
I thought for Christmas-

24:57.128 --> 24:59.452
They wanna take you
to the station house.

25:00.088 --> 25:01.548
I know.

25:05.592 --> 25:08.130
Do you have someone
to stay with them?

25:11.972 --> 25:13.550
Their mother?

25:18.352 --> 25:20.593
I'll be right back.
Abby?

25:22.145 --> 25:25.811
- Are you gonna be in jail for Christmas?
- I don't know.

25:30.985 --> 25:34.400
Maybe I should post bail for him.

25:35.739 --> 25:39.985
They have no money. Do you know where
they've been living? In a motel room.

25:40.159 --> 25:44.107
- Probably can't pay a security deposit.
- No, he has a job. But it's $5. 15 an hour.

25:44.287 --> 25:47.157
He has to steal to get his kids
a decent Christmas present.

25:47.331 --> 25:48.789
Could call the food bank.

25:48.874 --> 25:51.447
No, they help out this time of year.

25:51.542 --> 25:53.415
What happens to them in three months?

25:55.211 --> 25:57.002
There's only so much you can do.

25:58.921 --> 26:00.416
Yeah, I guess.

26:05.009 --> 26:06.966
I just...

26:10.013 --> 26:11.508
Miss your kids?

26:13.016 --> 26:14.842
Yeah.

26:17.893 --> 26:19.720
Sorry.

26:21.397 --> 26:23.852
It's worse at Christmas.

26:33.989 --> 26:35.945
Oh, right.

26:37.657 --> 26:39.781
- Where's the judge?
- In chambers.

26:42.370 --> 26:45.370
- Gentlemen, your counsel with you?
- They're on the way.

26:45.539 --> 26:48.373
While we wait for Ms. Prager
and Mr. Wharton...

26:48.541 --> 26:51.458
...I was wondering if I could talk
with Reece once more.

26:52.211 --> 26:56.371
- Only if you both agree, of course.
- Sure.

26:57.048 --> 26:58.920
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.

26:59.090 --> 27:01.545
Nancy,
will you ask him to come with me?

27:08.429 --> 27:09.806
It's okay.

27:11.723 --> 27:13.302
Go on.

27:15.394 --> 27:18.181
It's okay. Go, go.

27:18.563 --> 27:20.056
Just Reece this time.

27:37.201 --> 27:42.026
He'll have exploratory surgery.
They'll repair any injuries he might have.

27:42.162 --> 27:45.115
- He'll be home for the holidays?
- Wait and see how he does.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.706
So we celebrate a day or two late.
It doesn't matter.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.039
Thank you, doctor!

27:53.253 --> 27:57.714
- Did you get him upstairs?
- Along with his parents, aunts, cousins...

27:57.883 --> 28:01.582
Hope they all fit in the waiting room.

28:03.845 --> 28:05.504
You ready for this?

28:06.931 --> 28:10.760
God. I forgot. I mean, I didn't forget.
It's at home, yours.

28:10.932 --> 28:14.597
I don't know where my head is at,
though.

28:15.812 --> 28:17.270
Do you wanna open it anyway?

28:20.189 --> 28:23.888
- Can we wait?
- Sure.

28:25.110 --> 28:27.018
Sorry.

28:27.778 --> 28:29.438
Is something wrong?

28:31.114 --> 28:33.784
- I'm having family problems.
- Your grandma?

28:33.949 --> 28:37.114
No, no. It's my mother.

28:37.994 --> 28:43.449
She's not coming home for the holidays.
She and my father are...

28:43.623 --> 28:44.903
...splitting up.

28:46.042 --> 28:50.583
- Oh, no.
- I don't think it's sunk in yet.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.747
- Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
- How do you figure?

28:55.465 --> 28:58.667
- Did you ever meet my parents?
- I met Cookie.

28:58.968 --> 29:02.253
Right. She and Henry aren't divorced,
and they should be.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.141
- Still, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

29:10.684 --> 29:14.136
I'm so self-centered.
I thought it was something to do with me.

29:14.979 --> 29:18.097
No. You're about the only
thing going right in my life.

29:19.982 --> 29:22.763
- You shouldn't let this happen.
- Didn't want to be defensive.

29:22.943 --> 29:27.105
- What did he think of your new job?
- He wasn't overly impressed.

29:28.697 --> 29:30.238
There you are.

29:30.739 --> 29:33.526
Thank you for all rushing over.

29:34.701 --> 29:36.362
Be seated.

29:40.456 --> 29:43.241
We are in a unique situation.

29:43.875 --> 29:47.658
In a traditional custody case,
win or lose...

29:47.836 --> 29:49.958
...the parents maintain...

29:50.129 --> 29:52.584
...the title given to them
by their biology.

29:52.756 --> 29:54.794
They're still Mommy and Daddy.

29:54.964 --> 29:59.291
Here I'm asked to declare that one
of these two men is not, in fact, Daddy.

29:59.468 --> 30:04.924
But they both love Reece
and have made sacrifices to be with him...

30:05.098 --> 30:09.309
...though I will say Dr. Benton's effort
was late in the game.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.180
And I am uncomfortable
about the way he handled it.

30:12.519 --> 30:16.646
Not convinced he was exactly
forthright with the court.

30:16.813 --> 30:21.809
But the fact is that I do believe Reece
would thrive in either of your households.

30:21.985 --> 30:24.521
And that makes my decision even harder.

30:24.694 --> 30:28.106
But based on the evidence
provided by Dr. Benton...

30:28.141 --> 30:31.439
...that he will be more available
as a parent in the future...

30:31.616 --> 30:35.530
...and the fact that Reece has always
believed him to be his father...

30:36.495 --> 30:39.411
...the court grants custody
to Peter Benton.

30:40.665 --> 30:44.792
Mr. McGrath will be given visitation
with Reece every other Saturday.

30:46.918 --> 30:50.288
The court calls a 20-minute recess.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.010
We might have to go get one.

31:13.595 --> 31:15.968
- Use the angel.
- No, I always have a star.

31:16.140 --> 31:20.139
Okay, here we go. One, two, three.

31:24.106 --> 31:26.348
Yes, it is pretty. You finish your part?

31:31.070 --> 31:34.985
Hey, baby. Come here. Come over here.
Come lay under the tree.

31:42.122 --> 31:44.745
- You should get going.
- I got a half an hour.

31:44.918 --> 31:50.863
- Going to be late for your last shift.
- What are they gonna do? Fire me?

31:52.842 --> 31:57.042
- What are we doing?
- It's the best way to look at a tree.

31:57.221 --> 32:01.170
When I was Reece's age,
I used to do this for hours.

32:01.350 --> 32:04.802
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

32:05.270 --> 32:09.351
Hey, how long is the commute
to Schaumburg?

32:09.525 --> 32:13.736
- Depends on when you leave.
- I was thinking, if we both work there...

32:13.904 --> 32:15.777
Yeah?

32:18.033 --> 32:20.439
Maybe we should relocate.

32:21.869 --> 32:23.612
We?

32:24.747 --> 32:26.407
Yeah.

32:28.167 --> 32:33.505
This whole thing has made me focus.

32:33.673 --> 32:38.499
It's like all my life
I've been chasing something.

32:38.676 --> 32:41.213
That time when I can...

32:42.431 --> 32:46.760
...make it into the end zone
and spike the ball.

32:48.728 --> 32:52.060
It took almost losing my son to realize...

32:52.230 --> 32:54.854
...the end zone's not out there.

32:56.358 --> 32:58.483
It's right here.

32:59.987 --> 33:03.239
You're good raw material.
I can work with you.

33:03.993 --> 33:07.243
- Oh, you can?
- Yeah. I have to get you in shape.

33:07.997 --> 33:09.657
What kind of shape?

33:16.755 --> 33:20.336
- Hey, you found it.
- I knew it was in one of those boxes.

33:20.508 --> 33:23.628
Want to put it up there?
All right, come on.

33:28.434 --> 33:31.137
That's good.

33:31.211 --> 33:33.516
- I'm working New Year's Eve?
- Someone has to.

33:33.646 --> 33:35.602
- Someone else.
- Six-year-old, GSW.

33:35.773 --> 33:37.267
- Please save him.
- What happened?

33:37.441 --> 33:40.194
.38 caliber, right thorax,
crossed the midline.

33:40.361 --> 33:42.602
- Vitals?
- BP, 70/30. Pulse, 130.

33:42.781 --> 33:44.439
He's so pale.

33:44.614 --> 33:47.188
You his mother? What's his name?

33:47.575 --> 33:48.857
- What's his name?
- Teddy.

33:49.537 --> 33:52.620
Decreased breath sounds.
Full trauma panel. He needs a chest tube.

33:52.789 --> 33:54.615
- It's the two of us.
- How did it happen?

33:54.791 --> 33:56.699
I shot him.

33:58.877 --> 34:03.124
Surgery. Yes, that was Matt
on the pay phone.

34:13.975 --> 34:15.717
Peter.

34:15.893 --> 34:17.969
I guess I should say congratulations.

34:20.315 --> 34:22.188
Did you really get a new job?

34:23.150 --> 34:24.942
You gonna call me a liar again?

34:25.654 --> 34:29.650
- Here you are, Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, well, it's my last shift.

34:29.824 --> 34:31.199
What's your excuse?

34:32.369 --> 34:34.775
I wanted to give you
Reece's Christmas presents.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.159
You can leave them over there.

34:42.377 --> 34:44.583
- See you in two Saturdays.
- Yeah.

34:44.754 --> 34:47.043
Merry Christmas.

34:48.341 --> 34:50.216
Hey, Roger.

34:52.387 --> 34:55.257
Come over to the house tomorrow
and give them to him yourself.

34:57.851 --> 34:59.559
Thanks.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.727
I'm not doing it for you.

35:06.902 --> 35:10.851
Surgery.
Dr. Benton, the ER.

35:11.738 --> 35:13.612
- Sux on board.
- Our tree's by the window.

35:13.783 --> 35:16.355
-51/2 ET tube.
- There've been so many break-ins.

35:16.534 --> 35:19.026
- O-neg's running. Systolic's at 70.
- Call for a vent.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.197
- I was sleeping. I had the flu.
-10 blade.

35:21.665 --> 35:24.832
- He was supposed to be in bed.
- Long vascular clamp.

35:25.002 --> 35:27.671
He dropped an ornament.
I thought someone was breaking in.

35:27.838 --> 35:29.380
I'm in. Bag him.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.458
- GSW?
-6-year-old accidentally shot by his mom.

35:34.802 --> 35:36.760
Heart rate's down to 30.

35:39.182 --> 35:42.218
- Lost his pulse. Starting compressions.
- Thoracotomy tray.

35:42.393 --> 35:45.553
- What does that mean?
- We'll open his chest, repair the damage.

35:45.772 --> 35:48.643
- Four more units of blood.
- Scalpel.

35:48.816 --> 35:50.310
- Oh, God!
- Paula, come with me.

35:50.484 --> 35:51.765
500 cc's out the right side.

35:53.069 --> 35:55.395
- Ready with the rib-spreader.
- Suction on high.

35:55.572 --> 35:57.482
All right. Hang on, hang on.

35:58.743 --> 36:00.153
Crank it now. Come on.

36:03.748 --> 36:05.989
- Looks like two liters in there.
- Damn it.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.241
Pericardium's filled with blood. 15 blade.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.746
Call the O.R. We got a red blanket.
Page Romano.

36:11.964 --> 36:15.415
- Who shoots a 6-year-old?
- Thought he was a burglar.

36:15.592 --> 36:18.130
- A burglar who shakes presents?
-10 blade.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.545
- I'll clamshell the chest.
- Sternal saw.

36:20.722 --> 36:23.639
- We really going through the motions?
- Knife back. Metz.

36:23.808 --> 36:27.473
- Guess we are.
- Pick-ups. Come on, pick-ups!

36:27.645 --> 36:31.393
Damn it. Here's a fragment of the slug.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.601
- Looks weird.
- Saw. Let's move.

36:34.775 --> 36:37.944
- It's a Black Talon. Fragmenting bullet.
- Fragments at the hilum.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.984
- Looks like razor blades all over him.
- That's the point.

36:42.284 --> 36:43.741
- Order more FFP?
- On its way.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.611
Lost cause. Fragments in all chambers.
God knows what hit the great vessels.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.993
- Dr. Corday is here.
- She'll love being brought in on this.

36:51.168 --> 36:53.575
- What do we have?
- Organ donor.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.753
- BP dropping, 60/30.
- Hang two more units packed cells.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.922
- He'll go into DIC.
- We'll stay ahead with cryo and platelets.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.337
We've got other surgeries.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.083
Looks like a transverse colon injury
and dead bowel.

37:04.263 --> 37:08.012
I'm still in the chest. Repaired defects
to the left ventricle and right hilum.

37:08.183 --> 37:11.350
- Hope you brought your magic wand.
- Help me or get the hell out.

37:11.519 --> 37:14.272
Knock yourself out, Peter.
Either way, you're gone.

37:16.524 --> 37:19.311
We need to rebuild the IVC
from the kidneys caudally.

37:19.485 --> 37:23.401
More 2-0 silk on a Teflon pledget.
Come on. Keep them coming.

37:23.573 --> 37:25.862
Elizabeth, we can do this, all right?

37:26.868 --> 37:29.739
Prep a venous cardiac snare.

37:42.384 --> 37:44.041
Did I kill him?

37:45.094 --> 37:47.086
We don't know what his chances are.

37:47.847 --> 37:51.630
But he does have the best surgeons
I know working on him.

37:53.685 --> 37:55.512
How could I do this?

37:58.606 --> 38:00.351
You were scared.

38:02.610 --> 38:05.611
I keep telling God how sorry I am.

38:05.696 --> 38:07.737
That's all you can do.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.822
I don't even believe in God.

38:11.869 --> 38:14.193
Teddy never gets up from bed.

38:14.370 --> 38:17.158
I just wanted to protect our home.
I never thought he'd...

38:19.126 --> 38:21.830
You want me to take you to the O.R.?

38:25.924 --> 38:27.881
- Turn off the damn heat.
- Another Vicryl.

38:28.052 --> 38:31.136
- Gl stapler.
- Not much stool in the abdominal cavity.

38:31.305 --> 38:35.053
- Good sign. I expected more.
- Gut's done. What's the pressure?

38:35.225 --> 38:38.179
-80/40.
- Well, that's something.

38:38.353 --> 38:40.925
- Let me get another clip.
- Not much.

38:41.105 --> 38:43.976
Here we go. SMV is done.

38:44.150 --> 38:46.024
Cut.

38:47.152 --> 38:50.190
Shirley,
take down the balloon on the Pruitt.

38:52.241 --> 38:55.740
- Here we go. Catheter out.
- Balloon down.

38:55.911 --> 38:59.197
Throw in a good knot,
see if he stops bleeding.

38:59.581 --> 39:04.623
Come on, Teddy.
Come on, man. Come on.

39:08.590 --> 39:10.914
Look at that.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.090
- Yeah.
- That's incredible.

39:15.972 --> 39:21.428
Yeah. Well, all right. Here we go.
Releasing the clamp.

39:22.438 --> 39:26.386
- How the hell did you do that?
- I have no idea.

39:27.774 --> 39:29.483
Let's make sure of the count.

39:32.446 --> 39:33.691
- Is that the mother?
- Yeah.

39:33.863 --> 39:39.449
- You go tell her. I'll close up.
- Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.

39:39.619 --> 39:45.572
- Peter, that was truly remarkable.
- Little going-away present.

39:45.750 --> 39:50.121
Despite anything Romano may say,
this place is really gonna miss you.

39:50.297 --> 39:52.918
- I wish I could say the same.
- Wasn't all that bad.

39:54.133 --> 39:56.458
We had our moments.

40:04.183 --> 40:08.637
Your son lost a lot of blood. However,
we were able to repair the damage.

40:08.814 --> 40:12.479
He's got a long road ahead of him,
but he's gonna make it.

40:14.027 --> 40:16.648
I don't know how to thank you.

40:18.781 --> 40:21.486
Just get the gun out of your house.

41:45.365 --> 41:48.650
I guess Santa didn't buy you
that bike you asked for.

41:48.826 --> 41:52.574
- Carter, what are you doing here?
- Cleo told me this was on your route.

41:52.747 --> 41:54.739
- Come on. You want to join me?
- No.

41:54.915 --> 41:58.534
If I wanna get my heart rate up,
I'll have another cup of coffee.

42:00.002 --> 42:01.747
Got your message.

42:02.589 --> 42:04.997
Guess there's no way to
talk you out of it, huh?

42:05.674 --> 42:07.051
Done deal.

42:09.052 --> 42:11.131
I got you something.

42:11.555 --> 42:13.180
- Carter-
- Open it.

42:15.225 --> 42:17.134
You're a tough guy to shop for.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.983
An El token?

42:27.362 --> 42:31.873
Second week of my surgical internship
we got 11 traumas in one night.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.703
5 a. m., we were still patching together...

42:34.793 --> 42:37.449
a girl that had been dragged under a car.

42:38.330 --> 42:42.580
I was so tired I couldn't see straight.
I asked you if I could take a break...

42:42.752 --> 42:44.412
...and you kicked me out of the O.R.

42:45.839 --> 42:49.732
I couldn't drive home, I was so exhausted.
I started crying in the hallway.

42:49.767 --> 42:53.049
You came out of surgery
and you gave me that.

42:53.220 --> 42:56.423
You said I could use it to go home. Or...

42:56.599 --> 42:59.802
...I could commit to what I was doing
and...

42:59.894 --> 43:02.643
use it to come back the next day.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.987
No Rolex, huh?

43:15.616 --> 43:18.403
If you get tired of Schaumburg,
you can use it to come back.

43:18.578 --> 43:22.492
- Carter, they don't use tokens anymore.
- Then call.

43:22.624 --> 43:24.082
And I'll come pick you up.

43:31.258 --> 43:33.926
- Look, I want you to know-
- I know.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.884
That I owe you.

43:42.684 --> 43:44.178
Carter.

43:51.150 --> 43:53.358
Getting cold. I better move on.

43:54.612 --> 43:57.567
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

43:58.617 --> 44:00.075
Hey, Peter.

44:02.495 --> 44:04.404
I'm a good doctor because of you.

44:06.707 --> 44:08.665
No, you're not.

44:09.126 --> 44:11.660
But keep trying.
