00:09.792 --> 00:12.055
<i>Never in my life did I
think I would kill a man.</i>

00:16.103 --> 00:18.322
<i>Couldn't imagine
ever being that mad.</i>

00:20.759 --> 00:22.413
<i>But after everything he did...</i>

00:24.633 --> 00:27.418
<i>I wish I could wake him up
and kill his ass again.</i>

00:52.443 --> 00:54.837
<i>I grew up an only child.</i>

00:54.837 --> 00:57.622
<i>Some people think that
I have lived a sheltered life,</i>

00:58.971 --> 01:00.060
<i>but I disagree.</i>

01:01.757 --> 01:04.107
<i>I worked for everything
that I have.</i>

01:04.107 --> 01:07.110
<i>It might not be much,
but it's mine.</i>

01:08.459 --> 01:11.680
<i>My father was a police officer.</i>

01:11.680 --> 01:14.335
<i>He got killed in
the line of duty when I was 12.</i>

01:16.641 --> 01:18.165
<i>My mother was a teacher...</i>

01:19.644 --> 01:21.168
<i>but she's retired now.</i>

01:22.821 --> 01:25.128
<i>When she got
diagnosed with cancer</i>

01:25.128 --> 01:27.435
<i>she didn't have
the energy to work anymore.</i>

01:28.262 --> 01:30.133
Mama, wake up.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.052
<i>Since my pops died,</i>

01:36.052 --> 01:37.967
<i>it's been my job
to take care of her.</i>

01:37.967 --> 01:39.882
Thank you, baby.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.406
<i>She has her good days
and bad days.</i>

01:44.452 --> 01:46.236
<i>Mostly bad ones lately.</i>

01:52.024 --> 01:53.765
<i>I've always kept to myself...</i>

01:55.680 --> 01:57.465
<i>so I don't have any friends.</i>

02:00.250 --> 02:01.425
<i>I like it that way.</i>

02:03.210 --> 02:04.689
<i>It keeps me out of trouble.</i>

02:14.873 --> 02:16.092
You want something
from the store?

02:16.832 --> 02:18.225
You're going to get your money?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.487
Yes, ma'am.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.447
Bring me a-- a Vernors, please.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.232
Hand me my medicine
before you go.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.538
The big one over there.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
Oh, thank you.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.942
<i>The one friend
that I do have...</i>

02:41.987 --> 02:43.163
<i>Jay...</i>

02:45.774 --> 02:47.341
<i>is really like my brother.</i>

02:51.388 --> 02:52.911
Watch yo' back, nigga.

02:54.391 --> 02:58.221
Bruh, you play too much.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.281
That still you?

03:20.025 --> 03:21.592
No, bruh, that's all you.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.204
All right.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.515
What's up, Keisha?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.618
Hey, Noble.
What's happening, man?

03:47.618 --> 03:49.316
- How you doing?
I'm good.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.795
I guess you come here
to get your cash, huh?

03:50.795 --> 03:52.057
Yes, sir.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.320
How much money I owe you, man?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.756
Uh, $300.

03:54.756 --> 03:55.931
Oh, I see.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.804
Uh, ten cents a paper
times 1500 papers

03:59.804 --> 04:02.285
times two weeks equals $300.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.984
That's my man,
always do the math, man.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.551
Always. You hear me?

04:07.551 --> 04:08.857
All right,
let's get you squared away.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.601
Kelly, do me a favor.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.994
Go to the register and get
my man Noble 300, please.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.170
Thank you.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.304
If these peanuts
cost 50 cents each,

04:21.304 --> 04:22.871
why do you say
"two for a dollar?"

04:22.871 --> 04:24.699
Why not just say 50 cents each?

04:24.699 --> 04:26.309
Well, that's called
marketing, my friend.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.746
And see, why are you
gonna sell one

04:29.269 --> 04:31.532
when you can sell two
for twice the price? All right?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.490
Two for one
just makes people feel good,

04:33.490 --> 04:35.492
give 'em the warm and fuzzies,
you know what I'm saying?

04:35.492 --> 04:38.190
If you do the math,
it's the same damn thing,

04:38.190 --> 04:40.367
but most people
won't do the math, you know?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.673
So, it's like your gimmick
to make more money?

04:45.807 --> 04:48.157
- How much I owe you, man?
-$300 dollars.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.419
$300.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.572
'Scuse me.
You dropped your money.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.793
What is you, a boy scout?

05:16.490 --> 05:18.056
No.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.189
Well, I don't know
nobody that'd give that back.

05:21.799 --> 05:22.931
You keep it.

05:24.672 --> 05:25.760
My stuff.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.506
Better chill out
with all that attitude.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.814
You okay?

05:36.814 --> 05:38.381
- Mama, you okay?

05:57.966 --> 05:59.402
There seems to be

05:59.402 --> 06:01.404
a slight uptick
in your cancer cells,

06:01.404 --> 06:04.059
and I believe that's what's
causing your extreme nausea.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.191
What does that mean?

06:06.496 --> 06:09.107
That means that the cancer
cells have found a way

06:09.107 --> 06:12.850
to defeat the medication
and are starting to grow again.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.723
Can you stop it?

06:16.201 --> 06:17.942
We're definitely going to try.

06:18.465 --> 06:21.685
There's this new medication,
it's called Embrexa,

06:21.685 --> 06:23.252
and it's been working very well

06:23.252 --> 06:25.167
for cases that
are similar to yours.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.085
However, it can be
kind of expensive.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.218
What's kind of expensive?

06:33.654 --> 06:37.397
Well, we're talking
roughly about $6,000 a month.

06:40.443 --> 06:44.273
But I think that your insurance
covers up to 99% of the costs.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.146
Yeah, I thought
that would make you happy.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.500
That'll be $60.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.676
How much you got, babe?

06:55.676 --> 06:56.633
I don't have any money.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.722
I've got 48.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.379
Wait, yes I do.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.471
I'll take this, here you go.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.869
There you go.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.479
-$40 is your change.
- Thank you.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.614
Have a good day.

07:20.614 --> 07:21.789
You too.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.358
$6,000?

07:26.358 --> 07:28.273
Man, what the fuck?

07:28.273 --> 07:29.797
That's what
I need to be selling.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.800
What'd you say
that shit called again?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.149
Embrexa.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.585
They're not drug dealers.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.805
Pharmaceutical scientists.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.766
I looked it up.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.990
Okay. Whatever the fuck that is,

07:48.990 --> 07:52.080
they make money selling drugs,
so they drug dealers to me.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.691
Man, that shit insane.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.040
How the fuck
can y'all afford all that?

07:56.563 --> 07:58.129
Our insurance is paying for it.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.875
Man, what insurance
company y'all got?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.443
Them sons of bitches
let my grandmama die.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.799
- What's up, baby?
Hey.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.715
Hey, yo. Who got next?

08:20.064 --> 08:22.371
We do.
- You want to run?

08:22.937 --> 08:24.939
Nah, fuck y'all lames.
I got next.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.857

08:39.823 --> 08:41.259
Noble.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.522
Yes, ma'am?

08:43.958 --> 08:45.873
Bring me my good wig and
yellow dress out the closet.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.310
We going to church today.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.101
You sure?

08:57.972 --> 08:59.713
Yes, I'm sure.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.542
I haven't felt
this good in years.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.327
We're going to praise
the Lord in church today.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.329
Now, go get my stuff.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.422

09:13.422 --> 09:19.689

09:19.689 --> 09:21.299
Amen!

09:24.476 --> 09:27.610
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:27.610 --> 09:31.614
Yes, yes, yes! Amen, amen.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.790
Call him up
and tell him what you want.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.618
Yes!

09:35.618 --> 09:38.360
I think our choir
deserves a round of applause.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.497
Bless you. Take your
seats with love and honor.

09:46.324 --> 09:49.066
Amen, amen, amen, amen.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.329
Is that Jesus on the main line?

09:52.896 --> 09:54.637
Call Him up
and tell Him what you want.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.988
He didn't say He was
on the subsequent line,

09:57.988 --> 09:59.642
He said He was on the main line.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.515
Then call Him up
and tell Him what you want now.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.822
Now, that'll preach.
Let me tell you why.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.913
People confuse need and want.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.134
How many times
have we heard someone say,

10:13.134 --> 10:14.918
"Well, he don't need all that."

10:16.528 --> 10:18.443
"Well, does she
really need that?"

10:20.402 --> 10:22.143
Well, let me tell you
about the God that I saw.

10:24.362 --> 10:27.583
If God woke you up this morning

10:27.583 --> 10:30.934
and most of y'all
with your right minds.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.589
Yes, Lord.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.766
He gave you everything you need
to go and get what you want.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.554
- A!
Men!

10:45.253 --> 10:47.298
Call Him up and tell Him
what you want, church.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.870
Now, you know,
here at Greater United, we--

10:53.870 --> 10:55.785
we talk a lot about miracles.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.006
But very seldom do you
get an opportunity to see

10:59.006 --> 11:01.530
an actual living miracle
in your presence.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.750
Well, watch this.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.403
Sister McKinley, raise your hand

11:05.403 --> 11:06.796
so that everybody
can see that you here.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.798
That's Sister McKinley
right there.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.408
Let's give her a hand of praise.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.846
Amen. Amen!

11:15.762 --> 11:16.937
Praise God!

11:19.113 --> 11:22.725
We have been praying
for a long time...

11:22.725 --> 11:24.248
- Yes, Lord, yes you have.
Yes.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.423
...for Sister McKinley.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.993
Just a week ago...

11:31.255 --> 11:33.170
she was stricken
and she was in her bed.

11:33.605 --> 11:34.781
She couldn't get out.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.743
And I talked
to my dear friend...

11:41.918 --> 11:43.050
Deacon Green,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.314
and I talked to him
about God answering prayer.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.014
I want you to know...

11:51.972 --> 11:54.409
you are witnessing
a living miracle,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.063
the answer of prayer,

11:56.063 --> 11:58.587
because Sister McKinley
is right here with us.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.026
Thank you, thank you, yes.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.594
Everybody say, "Yeah!"

12:07.161 --> 12:09.076
- Thank you!
Say, "Yeah!"

12:09.076 --> 12:10.730
Yeah.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.254
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.735
He may not come
when you want him to.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.172
But he's what?

12:18.650 --> 12:21.305
Always right on time.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.612
Somebody say, "Yeah!"

12:23.612 --> 12:26.310
Yeah!

12:28.443 --> 12:29.531
How are you doing?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.099
Thank you so much.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.275
So I need you to go ahead and
handle your business, all right?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.672
Katherine. How are you?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.892
Oh, sure is good to see you.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.981
- Yes. Yeah.
- Good to see you, too.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.678
Pastor.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.463
- Hi, Sister McKinley.
Oh, my God.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.771
Kiki? Look at you.
You're so pretty.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.643
My, have you grown up
to be a beautiful young lady!

12:54.643 --> 12:56.166
Thank you.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.515
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.083
Oh, my goodness.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.172
Rosa Lee Kendry?.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.392
Katherine Lee McKinley!

13:04.392 --> 13:06.786
It's so good to see you!

13:33.160 --> 13:34.335
What's wrong, Ma?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.474
They're not gonna
pay for the medicine.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.310
But they can't do that.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.790
That's what insurance is for.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.923
No, they can do
whatever they want.

14:37.964 --> 14:42.969
I would really love to help you,
but there's nothing I can do.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.362
Once the panel makes a decision,

14:46.276 --> 14:48.235
well, my hands are tied.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.411
Can we talk to the panel then?

14:51.064 --> 14:53.675
The doctor said my mother's
medicine is covered.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.244
The doctor said.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.594
The doctor don't run this.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.685
He can't tell you
what we'll cover.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.383
This is a matter
of life and death.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.083
I know...

15:11.780 --> 15:14.304
but we can't save everybody.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.965
Can't save everybody?

15:24.140 --> 15:26.186
You shoulda punched
that bitch right in the throat

15:27.013 --> 15:29.624
like, "Bitch,
this ain't everybody,

15:30.059 --> 15:31.365
this is my mama."

15:34.498 --> 15:35.760
That's crazy, bro.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.849
How do you expect
someone to come up

15:37.849 --> 15:38.938
with that kind of money?

15:48.512 --> 15:50.036
I could talk
to Dada if you want.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.168
See if he'll put you on with us.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.432
No, thank you.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.479
I heard he killed somebody
for stealing from him.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.180
Then don't steal from him.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.575
It's just a option
for you to consider.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.882
There's nothing to consider.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.015
I'll never sell drugs.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.412
What, you mean
you'll never sell drugs?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.894
Shit. I'd do anything
to save my mama.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.463
How else do you expect to
come up with that much money?

16:27.551 --> 16:28.639
Every month.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.078
I'm gonna figure something out.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.996
Well, you better
figure something out fast.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.176
Where Mr. Green at?

16:43.176 --> 16:44.351
Aisle five.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.658
Mr. Green.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.225
Hey, what's going on,
my man? How you doing?

16:49.225 --> 16:51.227
- I'm good, uh.
All right.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.229
I was just wondering if I could
pick up an extra route or two

16:53.229 --> 16:54.578
to earn some extra money.

16:55.753 --> 16:56.841
Extra route?

16:58.365 --> 17:00.106
So, you're trying to get
some of those new Luccies, man?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.717
Nah, I just need to
earn some extra money.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.763
Okay.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.027
Guess I got something
I can give to you.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.986
Might be another route
I can give you for,

17:10.986 --> 17:12.292
let's say, $100 a week.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.121
But that's not the same pay.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.123
150.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.169
I'm trying
to help you out, Noble.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.217
125.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.570
Okay. I'll take it.

17:30.527 --> 17:31.615
All right.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.315
It's a good deal.
Good negotiating, all right?

17:35.315 --> 17:37.056
All right. We'll talk later.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.796
Come back, I'll make sure
I take care of you, all right?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.755
- All right?
- All right.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.845
Hey. Matter of fact,
go talk to pastor, all right?

17:43.845 --> 17:45.151
He might be
able to help you out.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.804
All right. Thank you, Mr. Green.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.023
Okay. You're welcome, man.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.547
14, 15...

17:52.593 --> 17:53.768
How can I help?

17:55.552 --> 17:56.640
It's my mother.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.340
The insurance company won't
pay for her medicine anymore.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.516
They cancelled it.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.127
We can't even meet
with the people

18:05.127 --> 18:06.781
for the next six months, so...

18:07.260 --> 18:09.566
we trying to raise the money
to pay for it ourselves.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.221
Hm.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.748
Well, I'm glad
you've come to me with this,

18:18.314 --> 18:20.011
and I'm certainly
willing to help,

18:20.534 --> 18:22.318
but it's not going to be a gift.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.538
I'm gonna expect you
to work around the church

18:25.191 --> 18:26.583
to work it off, okay?

18:27.454 --> 18:31.066
All right,
so what are we talking about?

18:33.199 --> 18:37.116
We need $5,186...

18:38.204 --> 18:39.292
a month.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.078
Hm.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.167
Well, the church
is in no position

18:45.167 --> 18:46.734
to give away that kind of money.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.693
Have you investigated
any other ways

18:49.693 --> 18:51.521
that you could raise the money?

18:51.521 --> 18:54.524
Yeah, I picked up
an extra route from Mr. Green.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.700
I was going to start
a FundMe page, too.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.572
Me and my best friend, Jay,

18:58.572 --> 19:00.922
we've been brainstorming ideas
on how to raise money.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.271
Jay?

19:02.271 --> 19:03.838
- Mrs. Ganvelle's son?
- Yeah.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.145
Okay.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.409
All right, well,
here's what I can do today.

19:10.758 --> 19:14.240
I'm going to
advance you $500, okay?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.633
Tell your mama I'm going to
start a special fund for her

19:16.633 --> 19:18.635
at church on Sunday,

19:19.332 --> 19:24.728
and I'm going to send over, uh,
one of the ladies from the, uh,

19:25.294 --> 19:27.644
ladies ministry
to help with the cooking

19:27.644 --> 19:29.168
and the cleaning
and that kind of stuff.

19:31.779 --> 19:35.348
Thank you, pastor.
I-- I really appreciate this.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.569
Here you go.

19:40.048 --> 19:43.747
Listen. Remember this.
God works in mysterious ways.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.273
So, how much you got?

19:49.753 --> 19:51.102
500 from the church...

19:52.103 --> 19:54.149
another 500 a month from Green.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.151
Now, all I need is...

19:57.283 --> 20:02.113
$4,686 for next month.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
Plus, I started the FundMe page.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.076
That shit don't work.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.210
There's literally
a million sad stories on there.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.560
You'll be lucky
if three people see your shit.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.389
Might as well start
casing the bank right now.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.955
I'm not going to break the law.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.741
Do you have a choice?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.004
- You gonna let your mama die?
No!

20:23.004 --> 20:24.484
Then what you gonna do, Noble?

20:24.484 --> 20:25.833
Get a job?

20:26.442 --> 20:29.576
What job gonna pay
an 18 year old $6,000 a month?

20:30.359 --> 20:31.534
I don't know.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.928
But robbing a bank
ain't the answer.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.800
Even if I do get away with it,

20:37.279 --> 20:40.891
I'd have enough money
for a couple of months.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.678
And then what?
I gotta rob another bank?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.159
How many banks
am I gonna have to rob?

20:48.159 --> 20:49.248
All of them!

20:50.553 --> 20:51.598
Shit.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.340
To keep my mama alive,
ain't a bank

20:54.340 --> 20:56.211
from here to Mississippi
that ain't gonna get it.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.997
I already told you what to do,

21:00.259 --> 21:03.218
but you ain't
never selling drugs.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.915
So, I don't know
what to tell you.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.178
Tell me it ain't no different

21:07.178 --> 21:08.789
from being
a "pharma suda centralist."

21:09.572 --> 21:11.357
Pharmaceutical scientist.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.403
Bro, whatever the fuck it is.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.797
They selling drugs to save lives

21:16.797 --> 21:19.060
and you'd be selling drugs
to save your mama's life.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.366
So, what's the difference?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.891
One is legal
and the other is illegal.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.289
There's legal and illegal.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.901
But then
there's right and wrong.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.470
What the insurance company
did was legal...

21:39.210 --> 21:40.473
but was it right?

21:50.091 --> 21:54.182
<i>I hate to admit it,
but Jay was right.</i>

21:54.791 --> 21:56.140
How are you doing, baby?

21:57.707 --> 22:00.101
So far, I picked up
an extra paper route,

22:00.101 --> 22:02.321
started us
a FundMe page, and...

22:04.540 --> 22:06.325
we got $500 from the church.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.197
You're so smart.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.419
Your father
would be so proud of you.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.378
You hold on to it.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.164
The pastor said
he's going to start

22:20.164 --> 22:21.557
an offering for us.

22:21.557 --> 22:22.906
And he's sending
one of the ladies

22:22.906 --> 22:24.081
from the church
to help around the house.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.652
That's good news.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.744
But I want to know
how you are doing.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.833
I'm okay, Mama.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.445
So now...

22:42.186 --> 22:47.148
all we need
is $4,686 next month.

22:48.497 --> 22:51.021
And I haven't even checked
the FundMe page yet.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.025
That's good news, Mama.

22:55.548 --> 22:56.636
Right?

22:59.116 --> 23:00.466
That's great news...

23:02.206 --> 23:03.730
but we're gonna need
more than that.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.341
I know, but we'll get it.

23:06.733 --> 23:07.821
Noble...

23:09.910 --> 23:11.477
I have to tell you something.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.048
The insurance company didn't pay

23:18.048 --> 23:20.224
for the medicine
that I already have.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.024
So, we have to pay for that

23:37.503 --> 23:40.157
in addition to coming up with
enough money for next month?

23:42.203 --> 23:43.465
It's okay, baby.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.375
Come in.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.379
Sister McKinley.

24:29.772 --> 24:30.860
How're we doing?

24:32.732 --> 24:36.213
I'm making it, Pastor,
but it's rough.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.346
Let us pray.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.744
Father God, we come to thee now,

24:45.222 --> 24:48.138
heads bowed, hearts abounding.

24:50.750 --> 24:55.972
Your faithful and good servant
is counting on you, God.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.936
We pray for our Noble...

25:06.156 --> 25:09.029
that he make good choices.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.511
Amen.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.561
Hello?

25:25.785 --> 25:28.570
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about, my nigga.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.398
Now, let's go save ma dukes.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.622
All right, let me do
all the talking.

25:37.448 --> 25:40.190
And remember, do not touch Dada.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.454
He be tripping on that shit.

25:44.630 --> 25:45.848
Okay.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.741
Hey, Jay.
What up, what up?

26:08.741 --> 26:10.133
Smells good.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.658
Hey, what's good, man?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.050
What's up?
How you doing, kid?

26:14.050 --> 26:15.182
Who the fuck is that?

26:18.707 --> 26:20.274
It's Jay and Noble off Waverly.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.103
Why would you open
the door while I'm bagging?

26:23.103 --> 26:24.452
Is you that damn dumb?

26:24.974 --> 26:27.107
Hey, it's Jay,
and he knew the knock.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.325
So what?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.285
You don't crack the door
for nobody

26:31.285 --> 26:33.243
while I'm in here working.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.115
I wouldn't give a fuck if
it was your dead mama, nigga.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.642
Man, get your stupid ass
in time out.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.558
But he did the knock, man.

26:46.779 --> 26:47.910
Dumbass.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.609
Where Dada at?

26:50.609 --> 26:51.827
Who I look like?

26:51.827 --> 26:54.003
Dada keeper? The fuck you want?

26:56.136 --> 26:57.616
You remember my mans,
Noble, right?

27:00.444 --> 27:02.142
He wanna be down with the team.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
We don't need no new guys, man.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.815
He real smart, Shooter.

27:22.815 --> 27:26.079
No bullshit. A genuine genius.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.864
He just needs some money
for his mama's medicine, man.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.650
She got cancer.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.522
That sound like
a personal problem, dog.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.961
Look.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.050
I know you don't
know Da like that,

27:41.050 --> 27:42.704
so you're a little bit leery.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.272
Yo.
- But you got my word, my nigga.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.882
He good.

27:49.232 --> 27:52.409
Fuck his mama
and fuck your word.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.935
<i>I should have
checked him right then.</i>

27:55.935 --> 27:58.546
<i>It would have saved me a whole
lot of headache later on.</i>

27:58.851 --> 28:00.635
Won't need no new niggas, nigga.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.073
Let's go.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.032
Put him on.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.208
Dada?

28:08.817 --> 28:09.992
I didn't even see you.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.038
Most people don't...

28:13.996 --> 28:15.519
until it's too late.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.221
You that dude from the store.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.919
I heard about your moms.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.227
It's fucked up,
so I'm gonna give you a chance.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.490
But don't get this shit twisted.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.971
I don't play
when it come to my money.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.850
You keep $2 for every sale
and bring me the rest.

28:42.503 --> 28:43.896
- You know how to count?
- Yeah.

28:44.548 --> 28:45.593
Okay.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
Don't make me regret this

28:47.769 --> 28:50.337
or I'm gonna fuck
both of y'all up.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.080
Tell them
to put him in rotation.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.298
Sure.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.224
Hey, put this bitch in rotation.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.185
Shut the fuck up.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.016
Shit, not in front of me.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.803
We've got to
cut this nigga in, too?

29:21.803 --> 29:22.978
Yeah, nigga.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.633
Nigga, you last bro.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.417
Monty, if you don't
shut the fuck up, man--

29:27.417 --> 29:28.810
<i>Monty never liked me.</i>

29:29.942 --> 29:31.073
<i>I don't know why.</i>

29:32.553 --> 29:34.294
<i>I guess that's just how he is.</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:37.297
Nigga, why?
Why is you always touching me?

29:38.689 --> 29:40.082
All right. Get your money, bro.

29:41.867 --> 29:42.955
How you doing?

29:45.218 --> 29:46.523
What the fuck is you doin'?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.613

Yeah. Come get this, man.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.142
All right, look at me

29:56.142 --> 29:57.230
That's my dough right there.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.492
Noble.

29:59.493 --> 30:00.711
What you doing out here?

30:01.408 --> 30:02.626
Trying to make some money.

30:02.626 --> 30:03.758

30:15.726 --> 30:17.076
Oh, yeah,

30:17.903 --> 30:20.340
You know, I know everybody,
and I won't charge you.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.646
- What's up?
- No, I got it.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.084
And I heard

30:25.649 --> 30:28.261
Streets talk.
I'm trying to help you out.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.267
How long you think

30:35.224 --> 30:36.922

30:43.885 --> 30:45.626
See, he's not gonna

30:46.235 --> 30:48.107
What happened to him
being a genuine genius, nigga?

30:48.107 --> 30:49.456
Come on
and sit back down, my nigga.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.066
Come on. Sit down.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.807
You all right, bro, you got it.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.853
It's your last day.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.158

31:12.305 --> 31:13.654
Here you go, Mama.

31:15.351 --> 31:16.744

- Thank you, baby.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.495
Who is that?

31:33.282 --> 31:34.370
It's Keisha.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.069
Kiki?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.505
Let her in!

31:42.639 --> 31:44.206
Hi, Sister McKinley.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.948
Pastor Stevens asked me to
come help you around the house.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.907
Oh, thank God.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.343
Noble been doing a good job,

31:50.343 --> 31:52.780
but no way Noble

31:52.780 --> 31:54.869
Deep cleaning
a woman's going do!

31:54.869 --> 31:56.262
I know, that's right.

31:56.262 --> 31:57.393
I got to go.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.221
Noble.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.441
Look how beautiful Keisha is.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.572
I gotta go.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.052
Boy, bye.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.927
So, how have you been?

32:14.410 --> 32:16.021
Man, I'm done for tonight.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.761
Mosquitoes bitin'.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.154
Who next?
No, no.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.764
My friend Noble will go next.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.636
No, thank you. I'm good.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.985
What's wrong, new guy?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.291
You scared of pussy?

32:26.379 --> 32:28.250
Scary as hell, bro.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.252
Come on, Dabs.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.862
Yes, sir!

32:31.862 --> 32:33.081
With all that dick you got,

32:33.081 --> 32:35.257
you better have my whole $40.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.737
Oh, I've got it right here.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.134
This ain't gonna work.

32:42.134 --> 32:45.311
I thought you said I'd be able
to make $6,000 a month.

32:46.268 --> 32:47.617
I know you didn't think

32:47.617 --> 32:48.836
you was gonna
make that from day one.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.534
Got to work your way up.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.537
$46 in three days?

32:55.538 --> 32:57.062
Be patient, nigga.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.064
You can't rush the game.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.370
Now, once you get enough money

33:01.370 --> 33:04.199
to cop your own work,
you'll make more money.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.462
What you mean?

33:09.726 --> 33:11.337
It take money to make money.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.297
The more work you cop,
the more money you make.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.126
How much more?

33:19.432 --> 33:22.000
Depends on what you buy,
how fast you move it.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.616
Here, nigga.
Ain't fuck with it, fucker.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.661
It's the new guy.

33:31.661 --> 33:32.749
Let him in.

33:33.663 --> 33:36.231
Uh-huh.
Got your stupid ass, nigga.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.450
Fuck you can't keep goin'.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.628
What up, doe?

33:41.628 --> 33:43.195
Dada, can I talk to you?

33:43.934 --> 33:45.023
Yeah, talk nigga.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.633
I need to make more money.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.463
I'm serious. I really need to...

33:51.768 --> 33:53.292
cop my own work.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.211
Oh, shit.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.604
You got your own money.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.606
Now, that's
what I'm talking about.

34:03.606 --> 34:06.131
- How much you got?
I got $600.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.093
- So you sold 'em all?
Yeah.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.054
Tell you what I'mma do.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.578
I'mma sell you
50 oxies for that.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.493
You want it?

34:21.146 --> 34:22.538
How much can I make of that?

34:22.930 --> 34:24.453
That's up to you.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.848
1,000, 1,200,

34:28.240 --> 34:29.763
depending on
what you sell them for.

34:30.459 --> 34:31.939
I thought you said
you could do the math.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.897
I can. I'll take it.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.205
Yeah.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.124
I like this little nigga.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.517
He about his business.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.825
Man, fuck that nigga.

35:07.322 --> 35:08.758
How much are these?

35:08.758 --> 35:10.151
Half pill, 15.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.022
Whole, 25. Or two for 40.

35:12.284 --> 35:14.634
- And what are those again?
- Oxies.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.158
- You got oxies two for 40?
- Oxies.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.554
Lemme-- lemme get both of 'em,
lemme get two of 'em.

35:21.554 --> 35:22.772
All right.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.953
Hey! New guy
got oxies, two for 40!

35:29.953 --> 35:32.869
You got oxies? Oh.

35:32.869 --> 35:36.917
Hey, where'd you
get those from, man?

35:36.917 --> 35:38.223
I bought them from Dada.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.312
Okay!

35:42.705 --> 35:45.273
This boy bought to be ballin'!

35:47.623 --> 35:51.453
I think Noble is still hurt by
what happened between you two.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.414
He never really got over that.

35:58.547 --> 36:01.071
I know, Sister McKinley,

36:01.071 --> 36:04.074
and I really want to
make it up to him,

36:04.074 --> 36:06.729
but he won't even talk to me.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.341
Just be patient.

36:10.690 --> 36:11.778
When the time is right...

36:12.996 --> 36:14.041
he'll come around.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.610
You'll have your chance
to explain yourself.

36:27.620 --> 36:28.708
I gotta go.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.536
My sister's at your house.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.800
She'’ll watch your mama.
She's good at watching people.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.325
I know, Dabs,
but I've gotta go check on her.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.501
Okay.

36:43.592 --> 36:46.856
Hey, Noble.
Let me talk to you, man.

36:47.509 --> 36:51.252
Look, I'’ll sell those
for you if you want me to.

36:51.252 --> 36:55.125
I mean, it'’s up to you,
but I could sell those for you.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.127
How much
you want off each one?

36:57.127 --> 36:58.216
Two good?

36:58.607 --> 36:59.739
All right.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.697
Remember, half pill's 15--

37:01.697 --> 37:04.004
Whole pill 25, two for 40.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.269
Dabs.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.228
You keep three off each.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.882
- Bet.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.719
Noble, are you
still mad at Kiki?

37:25.678 --> 37:26.940
She broke my heart, Ma.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.814
Listen, Noble,
Kiki is a good girl.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.033
And?

37:33.033 --> 37:34.295
Just talk to her.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.123
For what?

37:36.123 --> 37:37.646
She'’ll never get a second chance
to break my heart.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.822
Just talk to her.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.607
Ain't nothing wrong
with listening.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.218
Listen, Ma.

37:44.218 --> 37:46.612
I'’ll think about it,
but that's over.

37:49.789 --> 37:50.920
Just talk to her.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.924
Okay, I'’m leaving.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.057
I'll see you tomorrow,
Sister McKinley.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.189
Bye, Noble.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.888
Hold up.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.106
I'’ll walk you home.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.370
You don't have to. I'll be okay.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.553
I better walk you home.
I insist.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.164
Okay.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.517
Good night.

38:38.794 --> 38:39.969
I'm sorry, Noble.

38:45.279 --> 38:46.976
Hey, I know I hurt you...

38:48.151 --> 38:49.892
and I really didn't mean to.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.199
I just...

38:55.333 --> 38:57.987
At the time, Noble,
I wasn't thinking clearly.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.644
Both of my parents
had just died.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.081
I was living
with my grandmother.

39:05.908 --> 39:08.389
Everything changed so fast.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.479
I really didn't know
how to handle it.

39:16.876 --> 39:18.138
Did you get my calls?

39:23.099 --> 39:24.187
Yes.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.497
It wasn't just you, Noble.

39:30.063 --> 39:34.067
I didn't answer
any phone calls or texts

39:34.067 --> 39:36.896
or return any calls
or listen to any messages.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.899
I just wasn't ready
to face the world.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.425
But I realize now
that that was a mistake

39:44.425 --> 39:46.209
and I'm sorry.

39:47.907 --> 39:49.474
I should have
answered your calls,

39:49.474 --> 39:50.866
if nobody else'’s.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.570
Yeah.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.104
I just
didn't know what happened.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.674
It just felt like
somebody ripped my heart

40:15.674 --> 40:17.415
out my chest and stomped on it.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.897
I really do love you, Noble.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.684
And I promise I'm going to
make this up to you.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.469
We'll see.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.690
See you tomorrow.

40:58.586 --> 41:00.806
There you go,
right there, just like that.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.990
Hey, yo, we gotta
do somethin'’ about Noble, man.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.167
What is you talking about?

41:14.167 --> 41:15.560
Man, this motherfucker
puttin'’ two for 40 oxies

41:15.560 --> 41:16.909
on the street, man.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.040
I can'’t make no goddamn money.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.261
Man, I don''’t give a fuck
about you making money.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.481
As long as he''’s copping from me,

41:23.829 --> 41:25.483
he can do
whatever the fuck he wanna do.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.093
That's his work.

41:28.311 --> 41:29.661
So, can I get some oxies then?

41:30.313 --> 41:31.880
Nope.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.360
Then what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

41:35.318 --> 41:36.406
Let me think.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.757
Cop your own motherfucking work.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.976
Then you can do
what the fuck he doin'’.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.545
Let me guess.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.592
You got on $300 pair of shoes...

41:49.071 --> 41:50.899
$600 pair of pants...

41:51.813 --> 41:53.249
and a $100 shirt.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.990
With no money to cop with!

41:54.990 --> 41:56.601
Goofy ass.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.603
Stupid motherfucker.

42:00.343 --> 42:02.476
- Not you, but you too.
Hey, yo.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.175
Did you tell them what I said?

42:06.175 --> 42:07.394
Gimme that work back
since it ain'’t

42:07.394 --> 42:08.874
good enough for you, nigga.

42:08.874 --> 42:10.440
Then it's time
to riddle nigga.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.138
- Gimme that shit back.
Some people don't

42:12.138 --> 42:13.487
understand nothing but pain.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.536
Hey, watch out.

42:18.927 --> 42:20.755
It'’s way better than the stuff
Shooter'’s got, bro.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.496
Hey, yo, Noble.

42:23.715 --> 42:24.933
Let me holler at you, bro.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.422
What'’s up?

42:35.857 --> 42:37.119
Could I cop some work from you?

42:39.339 --> 42:40.514
What about Shooter?

42:40.514 --> 42:42.211
Man, fuck that bullshit he got.

42:42.734 --> 42:44.910
You got them oxies,
that''’s what I want.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.352
All right.
- Thank you.

42:52.352 --> 42:54.093
I'’ll give you
the same thing I'’m giving him.

42:54.093 --> 42:56.356
- Three off each.
All right, bet, deal.

43:19.292 --> 43:21.294
Really, nigga?
- That'’s a family heirloom.

43:21.294 --> 43:23.383
There'’s a whole story behind it.

43:23.383 --> 43:25.167
It's been passed
down for generations.

43:25.167 --> 43:26.865
I know
what an heirloom is, Noble.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.129
Come on, let'’s get out of here.

43:30.129 --> 43:31.304
Give me a second.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.922
That's the money you got saved
for your mom's medicine?

43:40.922 --> 43:42.532
Yeah, that'’s
for the next three months.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.752
That's $18,000?

I know you understand

44:20.527 --> 44:21.659
what I'm talking about.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.661
This isn't easy for any of us.

44:24.749 --> 44:26.272
You need to talk to him.

44:27.099 --> 44:28.187
I think he'll listen to you.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.277
- I'll talk to him.
- This is serious.

44:31.277 --> 44:32.887
- I mean serious.
Robert.

44:39.589 --> 44:40.678
I'll talk to him.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.078
- You ready?
Yeah.

44:51.732 --> 44:53.038
Hi, Pastor.

44:53.038 --> 44:54.517
Noble. How are you?

44:54.517 --> 44:56.258
I'm good.
Hi.

44:56.258 --> 44:57.651
Hey, Ma.
I'’m ready.

44:57.651 --> 44:58.870
Now, hold on.

44:59.435 --> 45:01.002
Listen, I'm getting
ready to leave, Keisha.

45:01.002 --> 45:02.700
- I'll drop you off.
Are you sure?

45:02.700 --> 45:04.310
I wouldn't want you
to go out of your way.

45:04.310 --> 45:08.096
No, I am absolutely sure.

45:09.881 --> 45:13.580
Noble, so I'll see you
in church on Sunday, yes?

45:14.189 --> 45:15.277
Yes, sir.

45:21.327 --> 45:22.458
Noble.

45:23.764 --> 45:24.809
Sit down.

45:35.515 --> 45:39.519
Let me tell you something about
this risky business you're in.

45:39.519 --> 45:43.131
People will come after you
out of pure jealousy.

45:43.131 --> 45:45.307
They don't need a reason.

45:45.307 --> 45:48.702
I know and I'm being careful,
Ma, I promise.

45:49.616 --> 45:51.661
Soon as I save up enough money,

45:51.661 --> 45:53.794
I'm going to start a business
and leave it alone.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.973
- That's what they all say.
I promise.

46:10.506 --> 46:12.770

47:07.912 --> 47:10.175
I just can't believe
it was only $500.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.221
That's a lot of money.

47:14.483 --> 47:18.357
I know, but,
I mean, considering.

47:19.271 --> 47:21.099
Don't get distracted, Noble.

47:21.708 --> 47:24.363
Stay focused.
You don't need all this stuff.

47:26.713 --> 47:28.628
What about
your mama's medicine?

47:29.063 --> 47:30.151
I got enough for that.

47:30.717 --> 47:31.936

48:30.951 --> 48:32.474
Stop playing with me, nigga.

48:32.474 --> 48:33.954

48:37.218 --> 48:38.524

48:38.524 --> 48:40.134
Why can'’t you get it from Dada?

48:40.134 --> 48:41.701

Yeah, 'sup.

49:08.554 --> 49:09.685

Noble, don't you bring

50:09.876 --> 50:12.226

50:16.970 --> 50:18.145
I need that back.

50:19.277 --> 50:21.148
Hey, I need to talk
to you about that man.

50:21.975 --> 50:23.194
I got robbed.

50:24.630 --> 50:26.762
I mean, I fought him
like a motherfucker, but shit.

50:26.762 --> 50:28.764
He had a gun.
There wasn'’t shit I could do.

50:30.984 --> 50:32.986
But that's the bag
I gave you right there.

50:32.986 --> 50:34.292
I'm not stupid, Shooter.

50:36.076 --> 50:37.860
He took the work, not the bag.

50:38.383 --> 50:40.037
You calling me a liar, nigga?

50:40.037 --> 50:41.473
I just want my money.

50:42.343 --> 50:43.431

50:44.911 --> 50:46.478
You worry about
some motherfucking money

50:46.478 --> 50:48.349

I almost got killed?

50:48.828 --> 50:50.351
Nigga, fuck your money.

50:50.351 --> 50:52.049
I give it to you when I get it.

50:53.180 --> 50:56.096

51:13.679 --> 51:16.812
Sometimes months,
unless you find a plug.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.251
I don'’t got months.

51:21.513 --> 51:22.601
What'’s a plug?

51:23.776 --> 51:24.907
The main supplier.

51:33.264 --> 51:34.874
You need to beat Shooter'’s ass.

51:37.268 --> 51:39.270
You can't let
that nigga run over you

51:40.575 --> 51:42.490

keep running over you.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.405

Even if you lose the fight,

51:53.588 --> 51:54.720
he'll know you ain't no ho.

51:56.156 --> 51:57.766
When's the last time
you been killed?

52:01.596 --> 52:02.902
What?

52:03.250 --> 52:06.079
Exactly. Did you miss
the part about the gun?

52:40.679 --> 52:41.984
Thank you for understanding.

52:43.072 --> 52:44.770

your mother needed money?

54:33.052 --> 54:34.706
I don't know.

54:34.706 --> 54:37.491

trying to keep it private.

1:01:18.413 --> 1:01:19.893
But y'’all wanna put a kid...

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:22.504
in charge of the streets?

1:01:24.811 --> 1:01:25.899
Y'’all do that.

1:01:28.206 --> 1:01:29.294
Y'’all do that.

1:01:36.127 --> 1:01:37.694
Good luck, little nigga.

Ugh, bae,

1:02:44.630 --> 1:02:47.154
We can'’t have him out here
with his collar all crooked.

1:02:50.462 --> 1:02:54.422
Hey, Jay. Oh, one hour, yeah?

1:02:59.166 --> 1:03:00.515

Mm-hmm.

1:03:07.435 --> 1:03:08.567
It'’s cool.

1:03:09.263 --> 1:03:10.699
I don't like smart women anyway.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:15.922
I'm about to get started.

1:03:15.922 --> 1:03:17.097
I don't.

1:03:17.402 --> 1:03:18.925
They always trying to rush it.

1:03:19.273 --> 1:03:21.232
They always want to travel
and get married and shit.

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:24.670
I'm just trying to smash
then lay up and watch TV.

1:03:26.106 --> 1:03:27.238
Bro, what?

1:03:28.413 --> 1:03:29.849
That's crazy.

1:03:29.849 --> 1:03:31.459

Noble, what is that?

1:04:16.113 --> 1:04:17.288
Nothing, Ma.

1:04:17.766 --> 1:04:19.812
Just some idiot
playing his music too loud.

1:04:20.595 --> 1:04:22.554
- They gone now.
Chill, bro.

1:04:23.381 --> 1:04:24.425
What'’re you doin', man?

1:04:25.426 --> 1:04:26.775
What'’re you talking about?

1:04:27.254 --> 1:04:31.868
The car, the paint,
the rims, the sounds?

1:04:32.216 --> 1:04:34.044
- What's that?
- I bought me a car.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:36.873
- What's your problem?
- Bro,

1:04:36.873 --> 1:04:38.744
that's unnecessary attention.

1:04:40.267 --> 1:04:41.355
It's just a car.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:43.009
Nigga, you bought one.

1:04:48.449 --> 1:04:50.060
What is that smell?

1:04:51.975 --> 1:04:54.499
Girl, I was
dreaming about some fish

1:04:55.021 --> 1:04:57.850
and woke up
craving salmon croquettes.

1:04:57.850 --> 1:04:59.330
Can I open the window?

1:04:59.330 --> 1:05:00.897
That smell is
making me nauseous.

1:05:03.377 --> 1:05:05.945
Sure, baby. I'm sorry.

1:05:10.819 --> 1:05:13.474
How do you feel about Tasha?

1:05:14.127 --> 1:05:15.215
Who'’s Tasha?

1:05:16.216 --> 1:05:18.044
It's not just a car, Monty.

1:05:18.044 --> 1:05:19.350
That's a billboard.

1:05:19.828 --> 1:05:20.917
Get rid of it.

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:23.789
Whatever, nigga,
you got me fucked up.

1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:27.271
I'm not playing.

1:05:27.271 --> 1:05:29.186
Get rid of that thing
and don't bring it back.

1:05:29.534 --> 1:05:31.144
I'm serious.

1:05:33.712 --> 1:05:36.802
That's just a name
that I always loved.

1:05:43.765 --> 1:05:48.335
If Noble had been a girl,
I would have named him Tasha.

1:05:48.335 --> 1:05:50.859
- It's pretty.

1:05:54.298 --> 1:05:55.603
This shit, man.

1:06:09.791 --> 1:06:11.968
This nigga Monty
getting paper now too?

1:06:13.621 --> 1:06:15.319
Man.

1:06:15.319 --> 1:06:17.799
How long is you gonna let
this little motherfucker

1:06:17.799 --> 1:06:19.105
get away with this shit?

1:06:21.238 --> 1:06:22.848
Should've never
put this nigga on!

1:06:23.544 --> 1:06:25.068
With your dumbass!

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:27.113
Nigga, who the fuck
is you talking to?

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:30.943
I'm saying they eating
like a motherfucker.

1:06:30.943 --> 1:06:33.032
Maybe I start rolling
with these niggas.

1:06:33.032 --> 1:06:36.818
Then get the fuck on then,
you dick riding ass nigga.

1:06:39.908 --> 1:06:41.867
I told you to give me a minute,

1:06:42.433 --> 1:06:45.653
but if you can't wait,
then get the fuck on!

1:06:48.439 --> 1:06:50.789
Look, D. It ain't like that.

1:06:50.789 --> 1:06:52.399
But you know me, nigga.

1:06:52.399 --> 1:06:54.662
I'm tired of waiting
and these motherfuckers

1:06:54.662 --> 1:06:56.229
is making us look stupid.

1:07:00.364 --> 1:07:01.495
You right.

1:07:02.366 --> 1:07:03.845
Playtime is over with.

1:07:03.845 --> 1:07:05.630
If you ask a girl
what she doing?

1:07:05.630 --> 1:07:09.547
And she say, "I was thinking,"
uh, you gotta go.

1:07:14.595 --> 1:07:16.249
You little bitch ass nigga.

1:07:20.775 --> 1:07:23.039
You sell another crumb
around this motherfucker,

1:07:23.430 --> 1:07:25.650
I'mma take you
for everything you got.

1:07:26.564 --> 1:07:27.869
You hear me?

1:07:32.222 --> 1:07:33.310
Look at me.

1:07:35.312 --> 1:07:36.400
Yeah, I hear you.

1:07:37.836 --> 1:07:39.838
Can'’t nobody save your ass.

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:43.015
Not one more
motherfucking crumb.

1:07:49.195 --> 1:07:51.023
Now try me
if you think I'’m playing.

1:07:59.379 --> 1:08:01.512
- Y'’all have a good day.

1:08:03.949 --> 1:08:05.342
Whoo.

1:08:06.647 --> 1:08:07.822
Oh, my God.

1:08:09.302 --> 1:08:11.522
I told you to fight that
nigga Shooter a long time ago.

1:08:11.522 --> 1:08:13.089
Now you gotta kill him, bro.

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:14.177
This shit ain'’t gonna stop.

1:08:15.439 --> 1:08:16.614
What you do, No?

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:21.184
I love children.

1:08:22.489 --> 1:08:24.926
I wished I could have had ten.

1:08:26.537 --> 1:08:27.842
I don't know about ten.

1:08:45.295 --> 1:08:46.426
Ready to go?

1:08:47.384 --> 1:08:48.515
Yeah.

1:09:03.051 --> 1:09:05.271
- Hi!
Hi, how are you?

1:09:05.271 --> 1:09:06.707
I am great.

1:09:06.707 --> 1:09:08.709
- Keisha, right?
Keisha.

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:10.537
Hi, and you are?

1:09:10.537 --> 1:09:12.191
- Dabs.
Dabs.

1:09:12.191 --> 1:09:14.324
- And you must be Noble.
- Yeah.

1:09:20.156 --> 1:09:24.160
All right. Now, as you can see,
all the floors are new.

1:09:25.117 --> 1:09:27.337
You got great flow through here.

1:09:27.772 --> 1:09:30.862
And the kitchen
is being completely remodeled,

1:09:30.862 --> 1:09:34.431
but the real jewel
in this home is the basement.

1:09:34.953 --> 1:09:36.041
Let's go take a look.

1:09:38.261 --> 1:09:39.610
Dada wants 2000.

1:09:40.088 --> 1:09:41.177
What do I tell him?

1:09:44.397 --> 1:09:46.704
Tell him to give you an hour
and I'’ll call him back.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.013
Hey, man,
gimme an hour, man, all right?

1:09:53.406 --> 1:09:55.974
Dabs.

1:09:59.543 --> 1:10:00.761
What'’s in the bag, buddy?

1:10:01.327 --> 1:10:02.502
Nothin''’, nothin'.

1:10:03.155 --> 1:10:04.765
Yeah, well, we gonna see.

1:10:04.765 --> 1:10:05.984
Hey, come on!

1:10:12.382 --> 1:10:13.774
Now why lie to me, Dabs?

1:10:14.514 --> 1:10:16.473
After all I did for you?

1:10:17.256 --> 1:10:18.649
Man, you breakin'’ my heart.

1:10:20.607 --> 1:10:21.826
I think I'’m ''‘bout to cry.

1:10:22.870 --> 1:10:24.394
That''’s not mine, man,
give it back.

1:10:26.047 --> 1:10:27.527
Or what, ho ass nigga?

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:31.575
I know whose it is.

1:10:33.272 --> 1:10:35.753
Tell that nigga I said
this is more than a crumb.

1:10:51.116 --> 1:10:55.033
Man, Dada and Shooter
just took my bag.

1:10:55.033 --> 1:10:56.991
- What happened?
- Man, they snatched it.

1:10:57.731 --> 1:10:58.993
And wouldn'’t give it back.

1:11:00.430 --> 1:11:03.171
Dada said to tell you
that'’s more than a crumb.

1:11:04.216 --> 1:11:05.435
Where they at?

1:11:05.913 --> 1:11:07.001
In front of his house.

1:11:09.439 --> 1:11:10.527
Come on.

1:11:12.093 --> 1:11:13.181
Fuck.

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:17.925
Look, Shoot.
It's the Powerpuff Girls.

1:11:21.581 --> 1:11:22.800
This nigga dumb.

1:11:24.236 --> 1:11:25.759
Where my money, Dada,
I'’m not playin' with you!

1:11:27.979 --> 1:11:29.372
Neither am I, motherfucker.

1:11:30.111 --> 1:11:31.374
The money'’s mine.

1:11:32.070 --> 1:11:34.768
Matter of fact,
everything you got is mine.

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:39.382
- Them shoes, this shirt.
Full of shit.

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:40.818
Even that car's mine.

1:11:41.862 --> 1:11:42.994
And I want it all.

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:46.084
And if you ain't
gonna give it to me...

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:49.522
then I'm just
going to have to take it.

1:11:51.002 --> 1:11:52.482
Now, see, the problem is...

1:11:53.352 --> 1:11:54.875
once I start taking shit...

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:57.835
I don't know when to stop.

1:11:59.402 --> 1:12:02.796
I might take your dog,
your bitch...

1:12:03.884 --> 1:12:06.365
and the milk from
your mama left titty, nigga.

1:12:07.714 --> 1:12:10.151
So don'’t come ''‘round
talking that tough shit

1:12:10.804 --> 1:12:12.545
because the only reason
you alive...

1:12:14.112 --> 1:12:15.983
is because I allow you to be.

1:12:20.118 --> 1:12:22.338
Nigga. Straight up.

1:12:24.644 --> 1:12:26.124
- Stupid-ass motherfucker.

1:12:26.907 --> 1:12:28.561
Ass nigga. What's up?

1:12:29.519 --> 1:12:31.129
Get your bitch-ass outta here.

1:12:31.129 --> 1:12:32.348
Come on, Noble.
Wake up, man.

1:12:33.174 --> 1:12:35.002
Damn, bitch ass nigga.

1:12:35.002 --> 1:12:36.961
Come on, wake up.
Let's go.

1:12:36.961 --> 1:12:38.876
You're not waking up, man.
Come on, get up, man, get up.

1:12:47.754 --> 1:12:49.539
You gonna have
to kill them niggas.

1:12:49.539 --> 1:12:51.018
Both of 'em.

1:12:51.018 --> 1:12:53.020
There ain't no way
around it now.

1:12:54.413 --> 1:12:57.547
I know these niggas,
and they ain't gonna stop.

1:13:01.246 --> 1:13:02.552
How many you say they took?

1:13:03.335 --> 1:13:04.380
Eight.

1:13:08.035 --> 1:13:10.386
8000 pills.

1:13:11.604 --> 1:13:13.040
That's unforgivable.

1:13:16.087 --> 1:13:17.741
If you gonna survive
in this game...

1:13:18.611 --> 1:13:20.787
then you gonna have
to dead them niggas.

1:13:22.006 --> 1:13:23.137
Both of them.

1:13:28.186 --> 1:13:32.016
<i>♪ You are important to me</i>

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:36.629
<i>♪ I need you to survive</i>

1:13:38.022 --> 1:13:41.460
Noble, come go
to church with me today.

1:13:42.287 --> 1:13:44.985
No, Ma, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1:13:45.638 --> 1:13:48.206
Why not?
It's good for your soul.

1:13:55.343 --> 1:13:56.954
Oh, my God.

1:13:56.954 --> 1:13:58.695
What happened to your face?

1:13:58.695 --> 1:14:00.958
I-- I got
into a little scuffle.

1:14:01.698 --> 1:14:03.526
Oh, baby. Come here.

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:05.179
Come here.

1:14:10.358 --> 1:14:14.450
You don't have to do this
for me, sweetheart.

1:14:15.799 --> 1:14:17.409
Please let it go, baby,

1:14:17.409 --> 1:14:19.977
I've lived
a long and happy life.

1:14:20.804 --> 1:14:22.849
And it's time
for you to live yours.

1:14:24.198 --> 1:14:26.200
You don't have
to do this for me.

1:14:27.419 --> 1:14:29.639
It's time for you
to let God take care of me.

1:14:33.381 --> 1:14:37.516
Oh, Lord. Dear Heavenly Father,
please watch over my child.

1:14:38.561 --> 1:14:40.388
Take away his fears.

1:14:41.912 --> 1:14:43.914
Help him to have the strength

1:14:43.914 --> 1:14:46.482
that he needs
to accept your will.

1:14:48.092 --> 1:14:49.397
Amen.

1:14:59.103 --> 1:15:01.148
Diante.
- Yeah?

1:15:01.148 --> 1:15:03.194
Can you come here?
- Yeah, yeah. What's up?

1:15:05.022 --> 1:15:07.111
We need some milk.
Can you go get me some?

1:15:07.111 --> 1:15:09.766
- Milk. Yeah. Got it.
- I'll go get my purse.

1:15:09.766 --> 1:15:11.855
No, no, no, it's cool.
I got-- I got my wallet.

1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:13.639
Thank you.

1:15:13.639 --> 1:15:15.554
Yeah, welcome, you're welcome.

1:15:19.689 --> 1:15:21.386
Bitch-ass nigga right there.

1:15:21.386 --> 1:15:22.692
Yeah, let's get his ass.

1:15:22.692 --> 1:15:24.084
This hoe ass nigger.

1:15:28.349 --> 1:15:29.481
What up, doe?

1:15:29.829 --> 1:15:33.703
Shooter. Dada. Damn. Again?

1:15:35.661 --> 1:15:37.707
So, you a whole bitch
out here now, Dabs?

1:15:37.707 --> 1:15:40.927
That was wrong, Dada.
Noble ain't do nothing to you.

1:15:40.927 --> 1:15:42.363
Ain't do nothing to me?

1:15:42.929 --> 1:15:45.105
Tell me what that
motherfucker did for me.

1:15:45.105 --> 1:15:47.151
I helped him

1:15:47.151 --> 1:15:49.022
just like I helped you and the
rest of these hoe-ass niggas.

1:15:49.980 --> 1:15:51.808
Who was there
when your parents died, Dabs?

1:15:52.330 --> 1:15:53.418
Me.

1:15:54.767 --> 1:15:57.161
And ain't none of you niggas
did nada for Dada!

1:15:57.988 --> 1:15:59.467
Ungrateful bitches.

1:16:06.997 --> 1:16:08.172
Let's take a ride, Dabs.

1:16:38.942 --> 1:16:40.378
Have you seen Diante?

1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:42.075
Not today.

1:16:47.559 --> 1:16:48.604
I think I'm done.

1:16:49.213 --> 1:16:50.388
Yeah.

1:16:51.868 --> 1:16:53.347
I think this is God's way
of telling you it's time.

1:16:54.218 --> 1:16:55.306
Me too.

1:16:55.915 --> 1:16:57.395
I'm glad you said that, Noble,

1:16:57.395 --> 1:16:58.701
'cause a lot of people
don't know

1:16:58.701 --> 1:17:00.137
when to leave the streets alone.

1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:04.620
They keep trying to make
a career out of selling drugs,

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.447
but it's more
of a temporary thing.

1:17:06.796 --> 1:17:07.884
All right.

1:17:08.928 --> 1:17:10.234
Good.

1:17:11.714 --> 1:17:13.454
'Cause I was about to go
and kick Shooter's ass myself.

1:17:15.456 --> 1:17:17.807
- You got my back.
- Always.

1:17:38.305 --> 1:17:39.742
Okay. I'll be right there.

1:17:46.749 --> 1:17:48.228
I'm going to stop, I promise.

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:52.319
I just need
to wrap some things up.

1:18:13.863 --> 1:18:15.995
Monty.

1:18:17.083 --> 1:18:18.128
What's up, Dada?

1:18:18.737 --> 1:18:19.956
Let's talk.

1:18:37.364 --> 1:18:38.844
Looking good, Playboy.

1:18:39.802 --> 1:18:40.890
Thanks.

1:18:40.890 --> 1:18:42.718
You got a nice chain.

1:18:43.153 --> 1:18:45.982
- Yeah, this is real nice.
Mm-hmm.

1:18:46.896 --> 1:18:48.288
Got a nice new car.

1:18:52.423 --> 1:18:53.685
You eatin' good.

1:18:54.381 --> 1:18:55.731
Lemme hold something.

1:19:04.435 --> 1:19:05.741
What's up, man?

1:19:07.394 --> 1:19:09.657
Listen, I ain't got it.

1:19:23.019 --> 1:19:25.804
Just gonna blow
this motherfucker face off.

1:19:25.804 --> 1:19:27.850
- Right now.

1:19:41.211 --> 1:19:42.342
Noble got it.

1:19:42.342 --> 1:19:44.910
F that shit.

1:19:45.868 --> 1:19:47.173
Noble got it, I swear.

1:19:48.696 --> 1:19:50.263
It's at his girl's house.

1:20:04.016 --> 1:20:05.539
Nice talkin'
to you, Monty.

1:20:08.542 --> 1:20:09.674
You positive?

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:11.894
Yeah.

1:20:12.459 --> 1:20:14.026
I'm not sure what he'll do next.

1:20:14.897 --> 1:20:16.812
I think it's best
to just leave it alone.

1:20:20.119 --> 1:20:22.426
I'll let
the members know your decision.

1:20:24.515 --> 1:20:26.299
I really feel like
you jumping the gun.

1:20:26.822 --> 1:20:28.345
I think you need
to give it more time.

1:20:29.346 --> 1:20:30.956
Come on, man.
Your people need you.

1:20:30.956 --> 1:20:32.088
Your mother needs you.

1:20:33.132 --> 1:20:34.351
I'll think about it.

1:20:34.351 --> 1:20:36.222
Ah, that's my boy.

1:20:36.788 --> 1:20:38.877
Look, man, these type of things
happen from time to time.

1:20:38.877 --> 1:20:39.965
All right?

1:20:42.228 --> 1:20:43.534
I'll take care of it for you.

1:20:45.449 --> 1:20:46.667
- What do you mean?
Dada.

1:20:46.667 --> 1:20:47.712
You know what the hell I mean.

1:20:49.235 --> 1:20:51.455
Talk to him, see if we can get
your money back for you.

1:20:52.586 --> 1:20:54.719
Look here, man, if you're going
to be a part of this thing

1:20:54.719 --> 1:20:56.547
in the future,
you are going to stay.

1:20:58.679 --> 1:21:00.290
You're going to have to handle
these things on your own.

1:21:00.290 --> 1:21:02.118
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1:21:03.771 --> 1:21:04.860
All right.

1:21:06.078 --> 1:21:07.253
It'll be all right.

1:21:30.624 --> 1:21:32.365
- I can explain.
- Explain what?

1:21:33.236 --> 1:21:37.544
Why would you stash drugs
at my house, Noble?

1:21:37.805 --> 1:21:39.503
After all I've been through

1:21:39.503 --> 1:21:42.071
and all you were talking
about quitting

1:21:42.071 --> 1:21:44.769
and realizing when God is
trying to tell you something,

1:21:44.769 --> 1:21:47.337
you go and put drugs
in my refrigerator?

1:21:47.337 --> 1:21:48.642
Keisha, it ain't even like that,

1:21:48.642 --> 1:21:50.383
I put that there
a long time ago.

1:21:54.213 --> 1:21:55.301
That's even worse.

1:21:58.087 --> 1:21:59.566
Just get your stuff and leave.

1:22:01.525 --> 1:22:02.656
Excuse me.

1:22:48.050 --> 1:22:50.182
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1:22:57.233 --> 1:22:58.364
Noble, what's wrong?

1:23:02.499 --> 1:23:03.717
I don't know what to do, Ma.

1:23:05.415 --> 1:23:08.070
It's like I want to stop,
but I can't stop.

1:23:09.506 --> 1:23:10.811
Why not?

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:12.857
I have so many
people depending on me.

1:23:14.076 --> 1:23:16.078
Those people
don't need you, baby.

1:23:17.470 --> 1:23:19.951
What are they going to do
if you die or go to prison?

1:23:20.908 --> 1:23:22.867
They'll find
another way to survive,

1:23:22.867 --> 1:23:25.130
- so don't believe that.
- You need me.

1:23:28.090 --> 1:23:31.006
There's not enough money
in the world to save me, Noble.

1:23:32.094 --> 1:23:35.010
You can't change God's plan.

1:23:36.359 --> 1:23:38.361
What you need to do
is focus on Keisha.

1:23:40.102 --> 1:23:42.800
I would, but that's over.

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:45.498
What do you mean that's over?

1:23:46.021 --> 1:23:47.065
She left me.

1:23:47.805 --> 1:23:48.893
No, she didn't.

1:23:50.155 --> 1:23:52.157
She might be
a little emotional right now,

1:23:52.157 --> 1:23:54.507
but, um, she still loves you.

1:23:57.032 --> 1:24:00.252
See, that's what you need
to be fighting for.

1:24:01.340 --> 1:24:03.473
- Keisha and your new family.

1:24:03.473 --> 1:24:06.345
What family?
You only family I got.

1:24:06.345 --> 1:24:08.608
Well, that's about to change.

1:24:14.136 --> 1:24:16.486
What you mean?
- Keisha's pregnant.

1:24:16.486 --> 1:24:18.836
- Why do you say that?

1:24:18.836 --> 1:24:20.316
Woman's intuition.

1:24:28.933 --> 1:24:31.675
Quit playing.
- I'm not playing.

1:24:31.675 --> 1:24:33.329
<i>The body of a young black man</i>

1:24:33.329 --> 1:24:35.331
<i>found in the Downriver
area last night</i>

1:24:35.331 --> 1:24:38.421
<i>has been identified
as 20-year-old Diante Watkins.</i>

1:24:38.421 --> 1:24:40.597
A woman's intuition.

1:25:02.662 --> 1:25:05.317
<i>Investigators believe that
Watkins was beaten to death</i>

1:25:05.317 --> 1:25:07.928
<i>and dumped in the river
approximately two days ago.</i>

1:25:07.928 --> 1:25:09.669
They killed Dabs.

1:25:09.669 --> 1:25:11.715
- What?
<i>It's on the news.</i>

1:25:11.715 --> 1:25:14.544
<i>Google it.</i>

1:25:14.544 --> 1:25:17.808
<i>You are asked to call
Detroit police immediately.</i>

1:25:17.808 --> 1:25:19.549
<i>The body of a young black man</i>

1:25:19.549 --> 1:25:21.551

1:25:21.551 --> 1:25:24.249

1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:32.039

public's help with this case.</i>

1:25:32.039 --> 1:25:34.346
<i>If you have any information
that might be helpful</i>

1:25:34.346 --> 1:25:36.348

1:25:36.348 --> 1:25:38.829
<i>you are asked to call
Detroit police immediately.</i>

1:25:39.395 --> 1:25:41.701
It's up to you, man,
I could sell those for you.

1:25:42.180 --> 1:25:43.877
You can keep three off each.

1:25:44.530 --> 1:25:45.749
Bet.

1:26:22.612 --> 1:26:23.961
What you want, Noble?

1:26:25.789 --> 1:26:27.356
Came to apologize.

1:26:29.271 --> 1:26:30.576
- Can I come in?
- No.

1:26:32.535 --> 1:26:34.319
I really don't want
to see you right now.

1:26:37.888 --> 1:26:39.498
I understand, Keisha...

1:26:42.588 --> 1:26:44.590
but I really need
to talk to you.

1:26:50.770 --> 1:26:51.858
They...

1:26:55.819 --> 1:26:57.212
They killed Dabs.

1:27:04.958 --> 1:27:06.351
I don't know what happened.

1:27:08.571 --> 1:27:10.790
I just know that I really
need somebody to talk to.

1:27:14.533 --> 1:27:15.795
Will you talk to me?

1:27:19.495 --> 1:27:21.845
I can't do it, Noble.

1:27:27.372 --> 1:27:28.852
My brother

1:27:30.114 --> 1:27:33.204
was all I had left...

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:36.860
in this world.

1:27:39.863 --> 1:27:42.431
And that lifestyle just...

1:27:43.736 --> 1:27:46.261
took him from me.

1:27:48.828 --> 1:27:50.526
I don't want to be around it.

1:27:52.136 --> 1:27:54.399
That's not
what I want in my life.

1:28:01.885 --> 1:28:03.016
I get it.

1:28:06.411 --> 1:28:08.283
And that all changes right now.

1:28:08.892 --> 1:28:09.980
I'm done.

1:28:11.242 --> 1:28:12.287
I promise.

1:28:14.593 --> 1:28:16.726
Please, just open the door
and let me talk to you.

1:28:16.726 --> 1:28:18.945
I can't do it, Noble.

1:28:59.334 --> 1:29:00.465
Don't leave.

1:29:25.011 --> 1:29:26.883
It's way too
dangerous in these streets

1:29:26.883 --> 1:29:28.232
to be asleep, nigga.

1:29:28.841 --> 1:29:30.277
Wake the fuck up.

1:29:34.194 --> 1:29:36.022
We can do this two ways.

1:29:38.503 --> 1:29:40.244
We can do this the easy way...

1:29:41.463 --> 1:29:43.029
or we can do this my way.

1:29:44.466 --> 1:29:46.163
Where the fuck is the work?

1:29:46.816 --> 1:29:48.557
It's not here,
but you can have it, Dada.

1:29:48.557 --> 1:29:49.775
I'm done with this shit.

1:29:50.254 --> 1:29:52.691
Strike one. You lyin'.

1:29:53.997 --> 1:29:55.868
Leave him alone. He's not lying.

1:29:55.868 --> 1:29:58.436
Shut up, bitch, 'fore I feed
you one of these bullets.

1:30:03.572 --> 1:30:04.964
Now, let's try this again.

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:07.314
Where the fuck is the work?

1:30:08.359 --> 1:30:09.752
I don't know,

1:30:10.230 --> 1:30:13.973
but it's not here, so get
the fuck out of my house.

1:30:19.718 --> 1:30:20.980
Bitch,
you must think I'm playing--

1:30:20.980 --> 1:30:21.851
It's at my house.

1:30:30.686 --> 1:30:32.818
Damn, you an ugly little bitch.

1:30:37.083 --> 1:30:39.564
Your grandma
was ugly as fuck too.

1:30:39.564 --> 1:30:41.523
I see where you get
this shit from.

1:30:43.263 --> 1:30:44.482
This shit ain't here.

1:30:44.482 --> 1:30:46.963
I told you, it's at my house.

1:30:48.007 --> 1:30:51.446
Take me to my house and I'll
give it to you and it's over.

1:30:55.232 --> 1:30:58.104
Nigga,
it's over when I say it's over.

1:31:03.936 --> 1:31:05.111
Let's go.

1:31:07.157 --> 1:31:08.767
What should we do
with this bitch?

1:31:09.681 --> 1:31:11.596
- Kill her.
Wait!

1:31:11.596 --> 1:31:13.032
You don't have to kill her.

1:31:13.468 --> 1:31:14.947
She ain't got nothin'
to do with this.

1:31:16.514 --> 1:31:17.559
She's pregnant, Dada.

1:31:18.211 --> 1:31:19.299
Come on, man.

1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:23.869
Better yet, I got a better idea.

1:31:25.131 --> 1:31:26.219
Bring her with us.

1:31:27.569 --> 1:31:29.962
And if this nigga
come up a dollar short...

1:31:32.182 --> 1:31:33.270
then you kill her.

1:31:33.270 --> 1:31:34.793
Yeah.

1:31:34.793 --> 1:31:35.968
Let's go.

1:31:38.971 --> 1:31:40.451
Fuck you waiting for?

1:31:49.199 --> 1:31:50.548
Stop moving, bitch.

1:31:50.896 --> 1:31:52.811
- Give me a second.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:31:53.377 --> 1:31:54.596
Fuck you think you're doing?

1:31:55.248 --> 1:31:56.859
Do I look dumb, motherfucker?

1:32:02.429 --> 1:32:04.257
If we ain't back in six minutes,

1:32:04.519 --> 1:32:06.129
put a bullet in that bitch.

1:32:06.129 --> 1:32:07.522
Fo'sho.

1:32:17.053 --> 1:32:18.141
Yeah.

1:32:19.621 --> 1:32:21.927
You little sexy ass thing,
ain't you?

1:32:22.624 --> 1:32:24.364
Pastor, I'll see you later.

1:32:24.364 --> 1:32:25.496
Mm-hmm.

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:28.020
Okay, bye-bye.

1:32:29.587 --> 1:32:32.503
Noble, where have you been?

1:32:32.503 --> 1:32:34.461
- And who's this?
- This is Dada.

1:32:34.461 --> 1:32:36.463
- How you doing, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

1:32:36.463 --> 1:32:37.856
But who are you?

1:32:38.335 --> 1:32:40.250
- I'm just a friend.
- Ma, it's cool.

1:32:40.250 --> 1:32:42.121
We're just here to pick up
some paperwork and we're out.

1:32:45.472 --> 1:32:47.562
Come here.

1:32:47.562 --> 1:32:51.435
I'm going to take your pussy
and feed it to my dog.

1:32:52.741 --> 1:32:54.699
Who the fuck
are you snatching away from?

1:33:32.519 --> 1:33:34.260
- Where's the rest of it?
That's it.

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:35.522
You already took eight of 'em.

1:33:35.522 --> 1:33:37.046
Don't play dumb, motherfucker.

1:33:37.524 --> 1:33:39.222
You forget who you talking to?

1:33:39.222 --> 1:33:40.702
There's still two missing.

1:33:42.355 --> 1:33:43.487
Jay got 'em.

1:33:44.662 --> 1:33:47.143
See, now that's gonna cost you.

1:33:47.883 --> 1:33:49.014
Let's go.

1:34:01.940 --> 1:34:03.115
Is that for me?

1:34:04.682 --> 1:34:06.553
Ain't you a little too old to
be playing with guns and shit?

1:34:08.773 --> 1:34:11.341
Look at you, man,
You used to be a soldier.

1:34:11.907 --> 1:34:13.473
Now, you just washed up,

1:34:13.473 --> 1:34:15.388
coming out the house
all loud and shit.

1:34:15.388 --> 1:34:16.868
You pathetic.

1:34:19.349 --> 1:34:20.524
Where are you going with that?

1:34:21.699 --> 1:34:22.831
He told me I could have this.

1:34:22.831 --> 1:34:24.354
No the hell he didn't.

1:34:24.354 --> 1:34:26.051
You don't walk past me
in my house.

1:34:26.051 --> 1:34:28.314
- Hey, let me go! Let me go!
- Ma! Ma!

1:34:30.273 --> 1:34:33.798
Make a move and I'll dead
both of you bitches right now.

1:34:35.060 --> 1:34:36.496
Noble.

1:34:36.496 --> 1:34:37.802
Let's go.

1:34:41.414 --> 1:34:42.677
Noble?

1:34:44.722 --> 1:34:45.941
- Oh, my God.

1:34:52.599 --> 1:34:53.949
Get your ass on, nigga.

1:34:53.949 --> 1:34:55.167
Walk, nigga.

1:34:55.167 --> 1:34:56.691
And don't try no funny shit.

1:35:08.833 --> 1:35:11.401
Hey, Noble! How's it going?

1:35:11.401 --> 1:35:13.142
I just came by to see your mama.

1:35:13.142 --> 1:35:15.057
She's not home
right now, pastor.

1:35:15.579 --> 1:35:18.060
Really? That's--
that's interesting

1:35:18.060 --> 1:35:19.888
because I just spoke to her
on the telephone.

1:35:19.888 --> 1:35:21.672
All right.
And you know what?

1:35:21.672 --> 1:35:23.282
You boys need to come
to church more often,

1:35:23.282 --> 1:35:24.762
I ain't seen you in a while.

1:35:24.762 --> 1:35:26.111
We good on church, pastor.

1:35:26.111 --> 1:35:27.722
So you can have a good night.

1:35:36.731 --> 1:35:37.775
On second thought...

1:35:39.298 --> 1:35:42.127
since I-- since I can't get
y'all to come to church...

1:35:43.607 --> 1:35:45.478
I guess I just
have to bring church to you.

1:35:54.574 --> 1:35:55.837
Put it down.

1:36:10.852 --> 1:36:12.244
Put it down.

1:36:15.204 --> 1:36:16.988
Fuck.

1:36:16.988 --> 1:36:19.512
You do realize that if I snap
my finger one more time,

1:36:19.512 --> 1:36:22.037
these gentlemen
will blow your brains out.

1:36:23.429 --> 1:36:25.127
Man, what kind of pastor is you?

1:36:25.127 --> 1:36:28.391
That's a good question,
but I got a few for you.

1:36:29.827 --> 1:36:31.394
Have you ever looked
into the eyes

1:36:31.394 --> 1:36:33.657
of a young child
dying from a gunshot wound?

1:36:34.527 --> 1:36:35.615
Hmm?

1:36:36.268 --> 1:36:38.401
The only mistake that they made

1:36:38.793 --> 1:36:41.360
is because they were trying
to steal something to eat.

1:36:42.231 --> 1:36:43.449
What about you?

1:36:44.886 --> 1:36:46.017
Hmm?

1:36:47.497 --> 1:36:52.067
Have you ever spent your last
dime on a family in need

1:36:52.067 --> 1:36:54.939
while you're waiting
for a government grant

1:36:54.939 --> 1:36:56.071
to be approved?

1:36:59.770 --> 1:37:00.815
Hmm?

1:37:02.207 --> 1:37:04.819
Have you ever looked
at someone that you love...

1:37:05.863 --> 1:37:07.125
who's dying?

1:37:08.692 --> 1:37:12.522
And the only thing between
them living and dying is money.

1:37:12.522 --> 1:37:14.306
Hmm? Hmm?

1:37:16.613 --> 1:37:19.834
Tell me,
can you imagine the burden...

1:37:21.836 --> 1:37:24.664
of trying to save a community...

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:32.324
that for generations has been
systematically disenfranchised,

1:37:32.977 --> 1:37:36.285
beaten down, used and abused?

1:37:36.938 --> 1:37:39.592
Some of them
so, so undereducated

1:37:39.592 --> 1:37:43.945
that they can't even read
or write enough to get a job.

1:37:46.425 --> 1:37:47.513
Hmm?

1:37:51.343 --> 1:37:52.649
Do they deserve to die?

1:37:53.302 --> 1:37:55.782
Do they not deserve
to have a good life?

1:37:55.782 --> 1:37:56.958
A decent life?

1:37:59.221 --> 1:38:01.876
They are why I do what I do.

1:38:02.746 --> 1:38:03.921
They are my why.

1:38:04.617 --> 1:38:06.141
You are my why.

1:38:09.187 --> 1:38:10.275
So, don't judge me.

1:38:11.059 --> 1:38:12.364
Leave that to God.

1:38:14.801 --> 1:38:16.064
I'm just a man.

1:38:16.978 --> 1:38:20.633
An ordinary man,
doing the best I can

1:38:20.633 --> 1:38:23.288
against insurmountable odds.

1:38:23.985 --> 1:38:26.117
Trying to level
the playing field

1:38:26.509 --> 1:38:30.469
for people that our society
has left for dead.

1:38:33.429 --> 1:38:34.560
Now...

1:38:35.997 --> 1:38:37.563
we are all going to die.

1:38:39.565 --> 1:38:40.697
That's inevitable.

1:38:42.917 --> 1:38:44.266
But it doesn't say anywhere...

1:38:46.137 --> 1:38:47.225
that we have to kill.

1:38:49.749 --> 1:38:50.837
Brothers.

1:38:53.014 --> 1:38:54.363
Put down your guns.

1:39:10.509 --> 1:39:12.424
I'’m not going
to let these shits off, Pastor.

1:39:12.424 --> 1:39:14.557
- Noble.
- They did too much!

1:39:14.557 --> 1:39:16.472
Noble.
- No!

1:39:16.472 --> 1:39:18.953
Noble, if healing has got
to begin, let it begin now.

1:39:18.953 --> 1:39:20.389
Not this time, pastor.

1:39:20.389 --> 1:39:21.999
It's got to start somewhere.

1:39:21.999 --> 1:39:23.783
They killed my friend Dabs
for no reason.

1:39:24.306 --> 1:39:27.396
He stole my money
and he smacked my mama.

1:39:27.918 --> 1:39:29.006
They did too much.

1:39:34.490 --> 1:39:35.882
Give me my fucking money.

1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:38.363
Strike one, motherfucker.

1:39:38.363 --> 1:39:40.148
Where's the other money
you stole from me?

1:39:42.193 --> 1:39:43.368
It's in the trunk.

1:40:02.779 --> 1:40:03.954
It's all there.

1:40:13.964 --> 1:40:15.052
Bitch!

1:40:15.531 --> 1:40:17.837
Don't ever touch me again!

1:40:26.324 --> 1:40:27.456
Now...

1:40:29.153 --> 1:40:31.329
which one of you
motherfuckers killed Dabs?

1:40:33.375 --> 1:40:35.681
I don't know what the fuck
you talking 'bout.

1:40:36.247 --> 1:40:37.596
Strike two.

1:40:40.121 --> 1:40:43.646
Let's try this again and stop
fucking playing with me.

1:40:43.646 --> 1:40:45.909
Which one of you
motherfuckers killed Dabs?

1:40:49.608 --> 1:40:50.740
Man, it was Shooter.

1:40:53.569 --> 1:40:55.571
You lying motherfucker!

1:40:55.571 --> 1:40:57.051
I wouldn't do that shit!

1:40:57.747 --> 1:41:00.619
Dada did it with
a baseball bat in his garage.

1:41:00.619 --> 1:41:01.968
Man, check the back
of the truck.

1:41:09.367 --> 1:41:12.109
Think about it, man.
I'm Shooter.

1:41:12.109 --> 1:41:14.285
If I'd did something
I would've popped his ass.

1:41:15.286 --> 1:41:17.506
I did a lot of
fucked up shit, I know,

1:41:18.289 --> 1:41:20.422
but I ain't do this,
not this time.

1:41:20.422 --> 1:41:22.902
I promise you. Dada did it.

1:41:26.515 --> 1:41:28.430
- You motherfucker.

1:41:28.430 --> 1:41:29.779
Strike three.

1:41:40.485 --> 1:41:45.708
No, Noble. Don'’t.
Don'’t. Don't, don'’t, don't.

1:41:45.708 --> 1:41:46.839
Noble!

1:43:13.970 --> 1:43:15.493
If there's anyone
in the room

1:43:15.493 --> 1:43:17.452
who ever received a letter
from Katherine,

1:43:17.452 --> 1:43:18.757
please raise your hand.

1:43:27.244 --> 1:43:29.028
And if it was...

1:43:30.726 --> 1:43:33.207
right on time, raise your hand.

1:43:41.737 --> 1:43:45.175
And if it appeared that
what she was writing to you

1:43:45.175 --> 1:43:48.918
was specifically for you
and your situation,

1:43:48.918 --> 1:43:50.354
raise your hand.

1:43:50.354 --> 1:43:52.226
Yes.
- Yes.

1:43:53.966 --> 1:43:55.664
Because that was her gift.

1:44:01.365 --> 1:44:02.453
And she was...

1:44:03.933 --> 1:44:06.414
kind enough to share
that with each one of us.

1:44:09.112 --> 1:44:10.983
We have so much
