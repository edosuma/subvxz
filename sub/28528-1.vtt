01:04.102 --> 01:07.143
<i>The year of our Lord 1501.</i>

01:07.145 --> 01:11.748
<i>Spain is wealthy, but fears
for its political power.</i>

01:11.750 --> 01:13.470
<i>Queen Isabella overthrew</i>

01:13.472 --> 01:15.672
<i>a thousand years
of Muslim rule</i>

01:15.674 --> 01:18.957
<i>and must have Catholic allies
to maintain her sovereignty.</i>

01:20.439 --> 01:23.282
<i>And England faces poverty.</i>

01:24.683 --> 01:26.363
<i>Henry VII and Queen Elizabeth</i>

01:26.365 --> 01:28.245
<i>have long needed rich allies</i>

01:28.247 --> 01:30.850
<i>to deter invasion
from France and Scotland.</i>

01:33.052 --> 01:36.035
<i>Both believe an alliance is
vital to solve their problems,</i>

01:36.037 --> 01:39.537
<i>and so a match has been made
between their eldest son</i>

01:39.539 --> 01:42.860
<i>and heir to the Tudor throne,
Prince Arthur,</i>

01:42.862 --> 01:46.346
<i>and the Spanish princess,
Catherine of Aragon.</i>

01:49.669 --> 01:51.469
<i>This alliance
will eventually make Catherine</i>

01:51.471 --> 01:53.431
<i>the Queen of England.</i>

01:53.433 --> 01:56.717
<i>She has been promised this
since she was a small child.</i>

02:08.809 --> 02:12.531
<i>The fortunes of both kingdoms
and the security of Europe</i>

02:12.533 --> 02:14.974
<i>rest upon Catherine's
young shoulders</i>

02:14.976 --> 02:16.936
<i>as she leaves her palace home</i>

02:16.938 --> 02:19.378
<i>to make the arduous journey
across Spain</i>

02:19.380 --> 02:22.423
<i>to the ship
that will carry her to England.</i>

02:24.385 --> 02:28.029
<i>But achieving her God-given
destiny comes at a price...</i>

02:37.759 --> 02:41.763
<i>For Catherine may never see
her beloved homeland again.</i>

02:56.539 --> 03:00.541
<i>"My own darling,
my dearest spouse,</i>

03:00.543 --> 03:04.905
<i>I feel a strong desire
to embrace you.</i>

03:04.907 --> 03:06.547
<i>Your letters have delighted me</i>

03:06.549 --> 03:09.430
<i>and your passion
rendered me so smitten.</i>

03:09.432 --> 03:12.353
<i>Let your coming to me
be hastened,</i>

03:12.355 --> 03:17.240
<i>that the love between us
reaps its joy and proper fruit.</i>

03:18.361 --> 03:22.083
<i>Your Highness'
most loving spouse, Arthur."</i>

03:22.085 --> 03:23.084
Arthur.

03:23.086 --> 03:25.088
<i>Highness?</i>

03:27.251 --> 03:29.851
Is it foolish
to believe myself in love

03:29.853 --> 03:32.374
with a man
whom I have never met?

03:32.376 --> 03:33.976
You love God,

03:33.978 --> 03:37.459
and you have never
met Him, either.

03:37.461 --> 03:41.103
I hope God has not read
my letters back to Arthur,

03:41.105 --> 03:44.108
or he would not
think me so devout.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.592
Good morning, <i>madre.</i>

07:00.232 --> 07:02.234
Highness!

07:11.604 --> 07:13.724
Daughter of Spain.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.365
Queen of England.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.327
Wife to Prince Arthur.

07:17.329 --> 07:19.049
<i>Daughter of Spain.
Queen of England.</i>

07:19.051 --> 07:20.651
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.
Daughter of Spain.</i>

07:20.653 --> 07:23.534
<i>Queen of England.
Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

07:23.536 --> 07:24.895
<i>Daughter of Spain.
Queen of England.</i>

07:24.897 --> 07:26.777
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

07:26.779 --> 07:28.019
<i>Daughter of Spain!</i>

07:28.021 --> 07:29.220
<i>Queen of England!</i>

07:29.222 --> 07:30.701
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur!</i>

07:30.703 --> 07:32.223
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.
Daughter of Spain.</i>

07:32.225 --> 07:33.744
<i>Queen of England.
Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

07:33.746 --> 07:36.107
<i>Daughter of Spain.
Daughter of Spain!</i>

07:36.109 --> 07:39.911
<i>Queen of England!
Wife to Prince Arthur!</i>

07:39.913 --> 07:41.915
Daughter of Spain.

07:43.316 --> 07:46.157
Queen of England.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.722
Wife to Prince Arthur.

08:36.091 --> 08:37.890
Hail Mary, full of grace.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.373
The Lord is with thee.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.414
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

08:46.142 --> 08:48.222
Hail Mary,
full of grace.

08:48.224 --> 08:51.025
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

08:51.027 --> 08:53.109
Holy Mary,
Mother of God...

08:54.991 --> 08:56.993
Henry.

08:59.516 --> 09:01.355
Have you had news?

09:03.800 --> 09:06.120
First we're
told her brother dies

09:06.122 --> 09:08.363
and her mother
cannot spare her.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.605
Then the princess has a fever,
and again she is delayed,

09:10.607 --> 09:14.569
and now I hear some Moorish
rebellion blocks her passage.

09:14.571 --> 09:17.572
Are you sure God isn't trying
to keep her from us, Lizzie?

09:17.574 --> 09:21.496
God tests her resolve
and ours,

09:21.498 --> 09:23.258
but every threat
is overcome,

09:23.260 --> 09:25.941
so it seems to me that
God protects our princess

09:25.943 --> 09:27.543
and brings her to us.

09:27.545 --> 09:29.945
My bride has sailed,
mother?

09:29.947 --> 09:33.829
She has, so you must leave
for Dogmersfield House,

09:33.831 --> 09:35.951
where she will break the
journey and you may meet.

09:35.953 --> 09:37.313
Are you
not coming with me?

09:37.315 --> 09:41.277
Your new brother
cannot bear the journey.

09:41.279 --> 09:43.759
Richard Pole will ride
with you as always,

09:43.761 --> 09:46.444
and your Aunt Maggie
will attend to you.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.650
You are not sleeping.

09:53.652 --> 09:57.013
We are beset
with enemies on every side.

09:57.015 --> 10:00.056
Until wedding bells ring out
and Spain becomes our ally,

10:00.058 --> 10:02.619
we have neither the...
the funds nor the...

10:02.621 --> 10:06.783
nor the men
to save ourselves...

10:06.785 --> 10:08.948
and all of Europe knows it.

10:10.950 --> 10:13.392
Until that girl arrives...

10:14.914 --> 10:17.196
we are lost.

10:28.007 --> 10:30.009
Arthur...

10:31.611 --> 10:35.335
your Aunt Maggie,
what does she say to you?

10:36.777 --> 10:38.697
You know
you must relay it to me.

10:38.699 --> 10:40.701
She says nothing,
Mother.

10:43.664 --> 10:45.824
My cousin may know
of plots against us.

10:45.826 --> 10:48.228
She cares for me,
and that is all.

10:53.154 --> 10:56.115
You must tell me
everything she says.

10:56.117 --> 10:58.439
Many are against us.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.003
God save you, Arthur.

11:23.185 --> 11:24.584
Highness!

11:28.190 --> 11:30.192
Ohh.

11:31.393 --> 11:35.355
Tell me, are you afraid?

11:39.442 --> 11:41.442
I have never
been to sea.

11:41.444 --> 11:45.406
It was God himself
who sent me to England.

11:45.408 --> 11:48.849
No wind or rain
will stop us.

11:48.851 --> 11:52.013
Did they not tell you that
when they chose you as my lady?

11:52.015 --> 11:54.017
I was chosen
when I was a girl.

11:55.899 --> 11:59.580
My father
was Mauro de Cardones.

11:59.582 --> 12:02.784
My mother's adviser
on the Moorish issue.

12:02.786 --> 12:04.385
Ambassador.

12:04.387 --> 12:06.227
Do you bring news
of our landing?

12:06.229 --> 12:08.430
We are blown
a little way off-course.

12:08.432 --> 12:10.874
I will fetch you something
for your stomach.

12:24.568 --> 12:26.571
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

12:27.652 --> 12:29.654
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

12:31.135 --> 12:33.137
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

12:36.541 --> 12:38.583
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

12:42.667 --> 12:44.908
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

12:48.874 --> 12:50.876
We are not in Spain.

13:08.494 --> 13:10.496
Get your hands
off of me.

13:27.754 --> 13:29.756
My name...

13:30.237 --> 13:32.117
Oviedo,

13:32.119 --> 13:35.240
and I, uh, remember,

13:35.242 --> 13:38.846
my, uh... lady.

13:53.581 --> 13:55.583
<i>Arthur!</i>

14:00.268 --> 14:02.270
<i>My lords.</i>

14:03.151 --> 14:05.433
Aunt Maggie.

14:08.476 --> 14:10.999
My brave hunters.

14:14.643 --> 14:16.603
Oh, Arthur.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.765
Oh. Rabbit stew.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.047
<i>Uncle Richard shot them.</i>

14:21.049 --> 14:23.009
I hesitated.

14:23.011 --> 14:25.932
Well, then you are
merciful to save a life

14:25.934 --> 14:28.495
when others are
too quick to take one.

14:28.497 --> 14:31.861
My mother does hold you
in high affection, Aunt Maggie.

14:35.384 --> 14:37.945
I do not like this house,
Richard.

14:37.947 --> 14:39.667
I want to go home.

14:39.669 --> 14:41.709
I miss the children.

14:41.711 --> 14:44.231
They will join us
in Westminster.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.236
It's not long now.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.760
I know that Galahad
has this...

14:52.762 --> 14:55.603
That boy's mind is
all over the place.

14:57.087 --> 14:59.367
<i>In a fog of
love, I suppose.</i>

14:59.369 --> 15:02.771
I nearly took an arrow
in the backside.

15:02.773 --> 15:04.693
The girl is coming, then?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.735
I have hoped,
after all this time...

15:06.737 --> 15:08.777
Her name is Catherine,

15:08.779 --> 15:11.139
and you must learn
to use it, Maggie,

15:11.141 --> 15:15.424
for the boy's sake
and our children's.

15:15.426 --> 15:16.945
You heard Arthur.

15:16.947 --> 15:20.629
The queen would like to
put the past behind us.

15:20.631 --> 15:22.311
I would like
that Spanish girl

15:22.313 --> 15:24.794
to sink down to the
bottom of the ocean,

15:24.796 --> 15:26.796
because she is the cause
of my pain and grief,

15:26.798 --> 15:28.838
and so is
Queen Elizabeth.

15:31.082 --> 15:33.965
But we do not get what we want
in this life, Richard.

15:36.247 --> 15:39.529
The king's mother travels to
Southampton to accompany her.

15:39.531 --> 15:41.651
Maybe the princess
will be so affrighted,

15:41.653 --> 15:43.453
she'll take the first
tide home again.

15:48.140 --> 15:51.261
<i>The child will be
exhausted, confused,</i>

15:51.263 --> 15:54.424
and humbled
by the sight of England.

15:54.426 --> 15:57.668
The ambassador will accompany
her from the quayside

15:57.670 --> 16:02.154
to greet me with a curtsey
at this dais.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.041
Hmm.

16:10.043 --> 16:13.164
And then we'll set forth to
Dogmersfield to meet the prince.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.365
Majesty.

16:14.367 --> 16:16.127
She will have learnt
the ways of England

16:16.129 --> 16:19.250
by the time she gets there.

16:25.659 --> 16:28.099
Your Royal Highness,

16:28.101 --> 16:30.622
England.

16:38.272 --> 16:41.796
<i>Lina, let me die.</i>

16:45.479 --> 16:47.119
Good.

16:47.121 --> 16:49.842
Then please land.
Land here.

16:49.844 --> 16:54.649
But the welcome party waits along
the coast for us at Southampton.

16:55.370 --> 16:57.730
Tell the captain
I have ordered it.

17:13.308 --> 17:15.310
<i>Rápido.</i>

17:18.834 --> 17:21.116
Is it always so cold?

17:32.408 --> 17:35.569
God save you,
my lady. God bless.

17:35.571 --> 17:37.651
Where is the church?

17:37.653 --> 17:40.575
Well, over the hill,
my lady.

17:40.577 --> 17:45.380
We will give thanks to God
for our safe arrival.

17:45.382 --> 17:48.222
I will find the mayor

17:48.224 --> 17:52.028
to arrange for us
an escort and horses.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.472
<i>Vamos.</i>

17:59.596 --> 18:02.319
Bless you, lady.
Bless you.

18:03.681 --> 18:05.683
Bless you also.

18:33.231 --> 18:37.233
Does it always rain this much in
England, Duke Stafford?

18:37.235 --> 18:39.916
It's Edward Stafford,
Duke of Buckingham,

18:39.918 --> 18:42.118
and, no, it doesn't.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.282
Sometimes
it hails or snows

18:45.284 --> 18:48.005
or floods.

18:48.007 --> 18:51.849
But the sun always
comes out in the end.

18:51.851 --> 18:54.411
You know, you really should
have landed at Southampton.

18:54.413 --> 18:55.973
We'll escort you
to Dogmersfield,

18:55.975 --> 18:58.738
where the king's mother
will now greet you.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.780
But your beauty does
cheer the rainy day,

19:02.782 --> 19:04.221
<i>as does your lady.</i>

19:04.223 --> 19:06.424
What's your name,
Spanish beauty?

19:06.426 --> 19:08.866
I am Rosa de Vargas,
señor.

19:08.868 --> 19:12.790
My ladies are to marry
nobles of the court.

19:12.792 --> 19:16.955
They will be chosen by the
prince and I for their piety.

19:16.957 --> 19:20.759
For their piety.

19:20.761 --> 19:24.845
Well, what a pity
I have a wife already.

19:26.286 --> 19:30.008
Prince Arthur wrote to me
of chivalry and faith.

19:30.010 --> 19:33.131
I do not think that England
lacks for piety.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.694
Stop looking
at him, Rosa.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.899
I am looking
at the English trees.

19:52.594 --> 19:54.674
Hail Mary, full of grace.

19:54.676 --> 19:55.795
The Lord is with thee.

19:55.797 --> 19:57.957
Blessed art thou...

19:57.959 --> 20:00.402
England, receive my blood!

20:10.732 --> 20:12.412
Lizzie.

20:12.414 --> 20:15.575
Lizzie, she's landed.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.422
In Plymouth for some reason,
but she is here.

20:23.946 --> 20:27.147
Finally I will see this...

20:27.149 --> 20:29.550
mythical creature
for myself.

20:29.552 --> 20:31.794
God smiles upon us.

20:36.359 --> 20:40.443
I will ride at first light
to see them.

20:51.094 --> 20:52.534
Harry shouted at her.

20:52.536 --> 20:55.139
He's been
in a rage all day.

22:00.286 --> 22:03.407
<i>House of Tudor,</i>

22:03.409 --> 22:06.611
<i>I give to you
our illustrious princess,</i>

22:06.613 --> 22:08.735
<i>Catherine of Aragon.</i>

22:19.786 --> 22:23.468
I speak English
perfectly well,

22:23.470 --> 22:26.111
and I am not a child.

22:26.113 --> 22:28.193
I am Princess of Spain

22:28.195 --> 22:29.955
and Princess of Wales.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.877
Soon to be
Princess of Wales.

22:31.879 --> 22:36.201
My marriage was held
by proxy in my absence,

22:36.203 --> 22:39.285
two times, I believe,

22:39.287 --> 22:43.891
so I am Princess of Wales
by law, yes?

22:44.612 --> 22:48.855
Your Grace, we thank God
for your safe arrival.

22:48.857 --> 22:49.976
I am Sir Richard Pole.

22:49.978 --> 22:51.980
This is
my wife Margaret.

22:52.901 --> 22:55.902
I would like to be inside,
out of these damp clothes.

22:55.904 --> 22:58.144
Oh, uh, these ladies
will take your belongings,

22:58.146 --> 22:59.546
- and then you can...
- I will bathe

22:59.548 --> 23:01.748
and then siesta.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.312
Sie... "Siesta?"
Is... Is this a food?

23:05.314 --> 23:08.475
It is, uh,
sleep, my lady.

23:08.477 --> 23:10.998
Sleep?
It's the afternoon.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.640
No, you'll have your full
introduction to Prince Arthur,

23:13.642 --> 23:16.724
- and then...
- No. I...

23:16.726 --> 23:19.807
I cannot meet him until we stand
together in God's presence.

23:19.809 --> 23:21.448
But you're
already married,

23:21.450 --> 23:23.611
twice,
as you've said,

23:23.613 --> 23:25.573
so God will have
no judgment

23:25.575 --> 23:27.254
on your meeting
your own husband.

23:27.256 --> 23:29.337
We are not blessed
in His sight,

23:29.339 --> 23:30.898
and I meet no one

23:30.900 --> 23:32.940
until the English mud
is washed off me

23:32.942 --> 23:35.145
and I have had siesta.

23:38.268 --> 23:39.747
<i>What in heaven's name
is that?</i>

23:39.749 --> 23:42.512
Oh, is parrot.

23:47.237 --> 23:49.157
I can't bear it.

23:49.159 --> 23:51.199
It hurts even
to look at her.

23:51.201 --> 23:55.165
You can,
and you will have to.

24:10.221 --> 24:12.582
<i>I will bring your popurrí.</i>

24:12.584 --> 24:14.586
Where is the light?

24:18.229 --> 24:20.872
It is you, señora.

24:22.354 --> 24:24.954
<i>You are the light.</i>

24:24.956 --> 24:27.079
I am happy...

24:28.480 --> 24:31.363
that they chose you
as my lady, Lina.

25:19.133 --> 25:22.614
<i>"My own darling,
my dearest spouse,</i>

25:22.616 --> 25:26.540
<i>I feel a strong desire
to embrace you."</i>

25:29.143 --> 25:33.145
Ah, bring the bath to the
Infanta's room at once.

25:33.147 --> 25:34.667
These go
to your kitchens

25:34.669 --> 25:36.751
to be stored
where it is dry.

25:38.353 --> 25:40.152
What is that?

25:40.154 --> 25:41.754
We don't need
your kindling.

25:41.756 --> 25:43.876
We know how to build
a fire in England.

25:43.878 --> 25:46.479
This is vanilla,
my lady,

25:46.481 --> 25:48.361
for the Infanta's bath,

25:48.363 --> 25:51.644
and the mint,
dried rose petals,

25:51.646 --> 25:53.246
marjoram oil, and...

25:53.248 --> 25:56.369
Did you bring
your own water, too?

25:56.371 --> 25:58.171
There is water here, no?

25:58.173 --> 25:59.933
The Infanta
must bathe every day.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.015
Every day? Nonsense.

26:02.017 --> 26:03.977
Once a week
will serve her,

26:03.979 --> 26:06.059
just the same
as everybody else.

26:06.061 --> 26:10.424
At the Alhambra, we have heated
baths with hot running water.

26:10.426 --> 26:12.306
She already
leaves all this behind.

26:12.308 --> 26:13.988
My lady,
if you'll excuse me,

26:13.990 --> 26:16.550
I'll see to it the soldiers
are billeted in the stables?

26:16.552 --> 26:18.913
The... The stables?

26:18.915 --> 26:21.315
Where they will sleep.

26:28.364 --> 26:30.367
Over there.

26:32.369 --> 26:34.929
Here?

26:34.931 --> 26:36.571
No.

26:36.573 --> 26:38.213
They are not animals.

26:38.215 --> 26:39.894
It was good enough
for our Lord.

26:39.896 --> 26:42.497
Is it good enough for you?

26:42.499 --> 26:45.340
These men
are soldiers of Spain.

26:45.342 --> 26:48.223
They have fought beside
Queen Isabella of Castile.

26:48.225 --> 26:50.025
I have given
my instructions.

26:50.027 --> 26:53.551
Does your prince wish for the
smell of caca in his castle?

26:54.832 --> 26:57.513
These men were brought
as a gift to him,

26:57.515 --> 26:59.837
part of the Infanta's dowry.

27:21.460 --> 27:24.383
Thank you for this,
uh, kindness.

27:25.784 --> 27:28.066
It was for our Infanta.

27:58.458 --> 28:01.301
Highness,
please wake up.

28:06.627 --> 28:07.986
<i>Open the door.</i>

28:11.472 --> 28:14.032
This is the king.

28:14.034 --> 28:15.914
Open the door.

28:15.916 --> 28:20.439
The Infanta, she is
sleeping, Your Grace.

28:20.441 --> 28:23.322
Well, kindly ask her to
rouse herself and let me in.

28:23.324 --> 28:24.964
<i>I will do
no such thing.</i>

28:24.966 --> 28:27.166
The Infanta has been brought up
modestly, Your Grace.

28:27.168 --> 28:28.848
And willfully.

28:28.850 --> 28:30.690
<i>Considering what has been
done to get you here,</i>

28:30.692 --> 28:32.571
<i>you'll kindly
pay us the courtesy of...</i>

28:32.573 --> 28:35.374
You speak of courtesy while you
bang your fists upon my door.

28:35.376 --> 28:37.016
I swear by my crown,

28:37.018 --> 28:39.899
I will summon my soldiers
to remove this bloody door

28:39.901 --> 28:42.464
<i>at its hinges
if you do not open it!</i>

28:59.882 --> 29:02.883
This is not the way
a king behaves.

29:02.885 --> 29:06.367
You do not have the right to
force yourself into my rooms.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.128
It is a bad beginning,

29:08.130 --> 29:10.651
and I will write my mother
of your disrespect.

29:10.653 --> 29:12.493
I merely wished
to lay my eyes

29:12.495 --> 29:16.899
upon what we have waited
half a year to see.

29:18.261 --> 29:21.542
Please, remove your veil.

29:21.544 --> 29:23.665
I wear my veil
until I am married.

29:23.667 --> 29:25.947
Here, our customs
are different.

29:25.949 --> 29:28.670
<i>You sound afraid,
Your Grace.</i>

29:28.672 --> 29:31.192
<i>Why would you be afraid?</i>

29:31.194 --> 29:33.435
You fear
I may be ugly?

29:33.437 --> 29:35.196
What difference
would it make?

29:35.198 --> 29:39.761
I am here to make a treaty
for my mother and my country,

29:39.763 --> 29:43.125
and you need me
more than we need you.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.866
Welcome.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.554
And now you will come
and meet my son...

30:10.835 --> 30:12.235
and perhaps you
will allow him

30:12.237 --> 30:15.761
to lay his eyes
upon you also.

30:59.766 --> 31:04.251
I-I am glad
to finally meet you.

31:06.613 --> 31:09.214
It rains.

31:09.216 --> 31:11.817
I would like to go inside.

31:11.819 --> 31:14.019
Oh, no, uh,
this isn't rain.

31:14.021 --> 31:15.661
It's drizzle.

31:15.663 --> 31:17.983
It is rain.

31:17.985 --> 31:20.506
Drizzle.

31:20.508 --> 31:23.389
We have many
different kinds of rain,

31:23.391 --> 31:28.394
downpours, drizzle,
mist, spitting,

31:28.396 --> 31:29.996
dancing dollies.

31:29.998 --> 31:32.038
It's why our gardens
are so green.

31:32.040 --> 31:36.042
Well, it is water
from the sky.

31:36.044 --> 31:38.084
It is wet.

31:38.086 --> 31:42.971
We... We cannot be alone
until we are married,

31:43.532 --> 31:46.853
and if we go inside,
then they can hear us.

31:46.855 --> 31:48.857
It's too small.

31:52.541 --> 31:55.822
I will try hard to be
a good husband to you.

31:55.824 --> 32:00.587
I will... I will always listen to
you, to your concerns,

32:00.589 --> 32:04.231
and I will be attentive to
your... to your needs.

32:04.233 --> 32:08.436
My need is that I
stay out of the rain

32:08.438 --> 32:10.958
so I do not catch
a chill.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.842
You were more caring
in your letters.

32:14.844 --> 32:17.725
You said that you
would cherish me

32:17.727 --> 32:22.650
and keep me safe
and love me.

32:22.652 --> 32:25.173
- I said...
- How you longed to hold me

32:25.175 --> 32:29.497
in your arms
until our union bore fruit.

32:29.499 --> 32:32.661
You were loving and poetic.

32:32.663 --> 32:34.503
And did you write back?

32:34.505 --> 32:36.024
Of course I did.

32:36.026 --> 32:37.986
- How many?
- Uh...

32:37.988 --> 32:40.108
How many times?

32:40.110 --> 32:42.911
I-I don't understand.

32:45.636 --> 32:47.638
<i>Arthur?</i>

32:51.723 --> 32:54.245
We will return
into the house.

33:06.298 --> 33:07.737
Now that they've met,

33:07.739 --> 33:09.659
we will escort
the prince to London.

33:09.661 --> 33:12.302
You'll follow after with the
princess, Stafford.

33:12.304 --> 33:14.626
Yes, of course, my lady.

33:19.912 --> 33:22.512
He did not know of them,

33:22.514 --> 33:25.235
the letters.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.400
I was...

33:28.841 --> 33:33.766
I shared my heart
and passion.

33:40.213 --> 33:44.057
I was intimate.

33:45.819 --> 33:48.099
Who is it
I have written to?

33:48.101 --> 33:53.064
Uh, what is the seal?

33:53.066 --> 33:57.471
Will-the noblemen who court us
write love letters to us, too?

33:59.353 --> 34:01.795
I imagined
that I was in love.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.358
Was it all a trick?

34:06.360 --> 34:11.165
And the king said,
"What was done to bring you here."

34:11.966 --> 34:14.007
What did he mean?

34:27.502 --> 34:28.741
<i>Mama!</i>

34:28.743 --> 34:29.902
Hello, darlings.

34:29.904 --> 34:31.304
Oh, here they are.

34:31.306 --> 34:32.585
I've missed you.

34:32.587 --> 34:35.027
- We missed you.
- Ursula.

34:35.030 --> 34:36.469
Mother!

34:36.471 --> 34:38.752
Shall we go and make
the room nice for Father?

34:38.754 --> 34:39.833
Yes!

34:39.835 --> 34:41.034
Have the little ones
behaved?

34:41.036 --> 34:42.315
Come along.

35:02.218 --> 35:05.419
I have finally
laid eyes on Catherine.

35:05.421 --> 35:07.622
She is willful, yes,
and obstinate,

35:07.624 --> 35:09.664
but our alliance
is in place,

35:09.666 --> 35:11.668
and we are safe.

35:14.951 --> 35:16.511
Was she comely?

35:16.513 --> 35:18.273
Hmm?

35:18.275 --> 35:20.957
Is she like the portrait
they sent us?

35:23.040 --> 35:26.001
Y-Yes, she is.

35:26.003 --> 35:29.124
As-you were
when we first met.

35:29.126 --> 35:32.529
She has your spirit,
and she is...

35:35.092 --> 35:37.094
Yes, she is beautiful.

35:37.815 --> 35:40.257
Now if you'll excuse me.

35:42.580 --> 35:45.461
I fear we shall have
trouble with that one.

35:45.463 --> 35:48.144
She's arrogant
and overprivileged.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.825
The perfect character
for a queen.

35:49.827 --> 35:54.070
But of course you'd like her
humble and penitent.

35:54.072 --> 35:55.671
I don't like her.

35:55.673 --> 35:58.675
She brings the might and
wealth of Spain to us.

35:58.677 --> 36:02.400
Who any of us like or do not
like is of no consequence.

36:04.923 --> 36:07.083
We won't stay long,
my love.

36:07.085 --> 36:09.728
We will go home
after the wedding.

36:11.410 --> 36:12.929
<i>Your Grace.</i>

36:12.931 --> 36:14.051
Hello, Maggie.

36:14.053 --> 36:16.055
Come, Ursula.

36:19.098 --> 36:21.618
We haven't seen each other
in the longest while.

36:21.620 --> 36:24.982
Sir Richard and I have been
busy with our family

36:24.984 --> 36:26.504
and running
Arthur's household,

36:26.506 --> 36:29.747
And now we must both
hand him over to another.

36:29.749 --> 36:32.149
It's strange,
isn't it?

36:32.151 --> 36:33.871
One day,
we'll be doing the same

36:33.873 --> 36:36.075
with my Harry and
your little Henry, too.

36:37.877 --> 36:39.757
Your Grace.

36:39.759 --> 36:44.042
Maggie, I would like you to
join me in my confinement.

36:44.044 --> 36:46.126
It would give us the
chance to reacquaint.

36:47.367 --> 36:49.207
I have Prince Arthur
and his new wife

36:49.209 --> 36:51.009
to attend to
at their seat at Ludlow.

36:51.011 --> 36:52.851
As soon as they are wed,
we will...

36:52.853 --> 36:56.375
Do you hear of traitors that
would raise against my husband?

36:56.377 --> 36:57.656
I tend to Arthur.

36:57.658 --> 36:59.578
That is all.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.582
Do you poison him
against me?

37:03.344 --> 37:05.946
You cannot stay this way
with me forever, Maggie.

37:08.109 --> 37:10.950
Our Spanish princess
will need a heart of stone

37:10.952 --> 37:13.194
if she is to survive
this family.

37:31.253 --> 37:33.213
This is not the palace.

37:33.215 --> 37:35.055
This is the tower.

37:35.057 --> 37:37.818
You'll stay in tower
apartments tonight.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.260
This is the custom
before a royal wedding.

37:40.262 --> 37:42.344
They're
most comfortable.

37:56.679 --> 37:58.439
Hello.

37:58.441 --> 38:01.162
May I introduce
Prince Henry, Duke of York?

38:01.164 --> 38:04.127
Harry.
People call me Harry.

38:05.969 --> 38:07.448
Do you like it here?

38:07.450 --> 38:10.852
It's cozy, isn't it?

38:10.854 --> 38:14.416
I'm Charlie Brandon,
not yet married.

38:14.418 --> 38:18.580
It's, uh, me who'll be leading
you up the aisle tomorrow.

38:18.582 --> 38:20.422
<i>Lucky you, eh?</i>

38:20.424 --> 38:24.068
Thank you for your
welcome, Prince Harry.

38:35.600 --> 38:40.122
They only use this place
for special occasions.

38:40.124 --> 38:42.965
What are you wearing
that veil for?

38:42.967 --> 38:46.649
<i>Is it to stop
my brother kissing you?</i>

38:46.651 --> 38:49.292
Because if it is,
I've, I've, um...

38:49.294 --> 38:52.375
I've got a little secret
to let you in on, and...

38:52.377 --> 38:54.337
My brother
is afraid of girls,

38:54.339 --> 38:58.341
so-you're probably
safe enough without it.

38:58.343 --> 39:00.345
I am not a girl, though.

39:02.588 --> 39:04.748
Whoa.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.752
Give that here.
Let me see.

39:10.996 --> 39:12.916
My lord, this is, um...

39:12.918 --> 39:14.438
<i>es muy peligroso.</i>

39:14.440 --> 39:15.679
<i>Oh, sí.</i>

39:15.681 --> 39:19.043
Give me a bolt. A bolt.

39:19.045 --> 39:21.407
Yes, yes, try her out.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.140
Be careful,
Your Grace.

39:36.142 --> 39:37.782
<i>Cuidado.
Ten cuidado,</i> my lord.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.264
Against the body.

39:39.266 --> 39:40.945
<i>El hombro!</i>

39:40.947 --> 39:42.347
Whoa!

39:44.471 --> 39:46.551
<i>I like it.</i>

39:46.553 --> 39:51.438
And you will teach me
how to use it.

39:52.159 --> 39:53.959
<i>Princess Catherine,</i>

39:53.961 --> 39:57.404
the queen has asked to see you
at the palace of Westminster.

39:59.447 --> 40:02.888
I'm going to need
better targets.

40:02.890 --> 40:07.495
Perhaps the seals
on love letters.

40:14.662 --> 40:18.146
I'm glad that you
want to kiss my neck.

40:30.839 --> 40:34.321
You'll make
a very handsome groom.

40:34.323 --> 40:36.365
Go, all of you.

40:45.494 --> 40:47.214
He sent her letters,

40:47.216 --> 40:49.779
bloody wrote to her.

40:53.182 --> 40:55.184
Harry.

40:56.946 --> 40:59.827
I tried to write to her
a year ago.

40:59.829 --> 41:01.990
I-I wanted...

41:01.992 --> 41:04.472
to be friends
before she came here.

41:04.474 --> 41:06.474
But I couldn't find
the words.

41:06.476 --> 41:07.996
I tried too hard.

41:07.998 --> 41:12.601
It sounded scholarly
or else too soft.

41:12.603 --> 41:15.323
And then Harry found them
and made fun of me,

41:15.325 --> 41:17.205
so I didn't try again.

41:17.207 --> 41:19.528
But he did.

41:19.530 --> 41:21.930
And she
wrote back to him.

41:21.932 --> 41:24.253
But she thought
she was writing back to you.

41:24.255 --> 41:25.934
It doesn't matter.

41:25.936 --> 41:27.896
He's...

41:27.898 --> 41:30.339
He's made love to her.

41:30.341 --> 41:32.703
With words, at least.

41:34.305 --> 41:35.905
He's ruined her.

41:35.907 --> 41:38.267
She isn't mine.

41:38.269 --> 41:43.032
He's jealous of you, Arthur,
because you'll be king,

41:43.034 --> 41:46.396
and your marriage
will bring peace to England,

41:46.398 --> 41:51.283
because your marriage
makes you powerful, hmm?

41:52.684 --> 41:54.324
<i>Careful.</i>

41:54.326 --> 41:56.846
When do you think we will
meet our husbands, Lina?

41:56.848 --> 42:01.734
Will they be men
or <i>muchachos bobos?</i>

42:02.374 --> 42:05.295
The Infanta will choose
husbands who are suitable.

42:05.297 --> 42:06.497
<i>My lady.</i>

42:06.499 --> 42:08.459
Lina.

42:08.461 --> 42:10.703
The herbs
for the Infanta's bath.

42:13.706 --> 42:15.906
My lady,
the king's mother.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.948
She must have stored
them in the rain.

42:17.950 --> 42:20.591
We must
replace them.

42:20.593 --> 42:23.875
It is her wedding day tomorrow.
She will want them.

42:23.877 --> 42:25.436
Where do we go?

42:25.438 --> 42:28.199
We do not know the city.

42:40.574 --> 42:43.215
Why do they live
in these damp caves?

42:43.217 --> 42:48.060
Ah, I will ask this person
where we can find some herbs.

42:48.062 --> 42:50.302
Rosa.

42:50.304 --> 42:52.704
Oh, <i>bellisima</i> Rosa,

42:52.706 --> 42:54.066
I've missed you.

42:54.068 --> 42:56.629
Where are you off to
in the dark?

42:56.631 --> 43:00.473
Uh, rosemary,
herb for the Infanta.

43:00.475 --> 43:02.477
Mm. Come.

43:10.565 --> 43:12.567
Rosa?

43:14.729 --> 43:17.690
Rosa?

43:34.710 --> 43:36.990
<i>Hey...</i>

43:36.992 --> 43:39.633
black pussycat.

43:39.635 --> 43:41.637
<i>Come.</i>

43:42.558 --> 43:43.918
Drink with me.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.559
Come on.

43:45.561 --> 43:47.844
Let's have some fun.

43:49.165 --> 43:51.085
Take your hands off me!

43:51.087 --> 43:53.488
- Let's have some fun!
- Hey!

43:53.490 --> 43:54.769
The lady
not like this.

43:54.771 --> 43:56.773
She is
of royal house.

44:01.418 --> 44:03.778
Do not be alone.
Men think of you badly.

44:03.780 --> 44:06.421
You should have
guarded me.

44:06.423 --> 44:09.184
The Infanta needs
herbs for her bath.

44:09.186 --> 44:12.910
What is, uh, "herbs"?

44:14.431 --> 44:18.313
Rosemary. <i>Romero.</i>

44:18.315 --> 44:21.837
Rosemary.
We ask in the...

44:21.839 --> 44:23.841
My...

44:25.883 --> 44:29.805
There. Is food there.

44:29.807 --> 44:31.887
Is called "pantry."

44:31.889 --> 44:34.530
<i>Sí.</i> Pansy.

44:35.854 --> 44:38.977
Maybe there is the ale
in the pansy also.

44:50.829 --> 44:54.431
You may take drink with me?

45:21.981 --> 45:23.984
Princess
Catherine of Aragon.

45:29.910 --> 45:32.150
<i>My husband tells me
you are beautiful.</i>

45:32.152 --> 45:33.632
<i>He is taken with you.</i>

45:33.634 --> 45:35.153
He was rude to me.

45:35.155 --> 45:38.717
<i>No, not rude.</i>

45:38.719 --> 45:41.720
Eager, desperate.

45:41.722 --> 45:43.762
He is a starving man,
and you are bread.

45:43.764 --> 45:45.766
We paid
a high price for you.

45:46.807 --> 45:48.969
What price?

45:51.612 --> 45:53.412
Yes, I see it.

45:53.414 --> 45:55.895
He said that you were...

45:55.897 --> 46:00.900
Well, he said that you were idealistic
and certain of your goodness.

46:00.902 --> 46:02.502
<i>When I first arrived at court,</i>

46:02.504 --> 46:05.545
all I wanted was
my liberty and love.

46:05.547 --> 46:08.908
My mother says that steel
runs through your veins.

46:08.910 --> 46:10.912
Did she say that?

46:12.914 --> 46:14.594
I'm flattered.

46:14.596 --> 46:16.436
<i>It wasn't always so.</i>

46:16.438 --> 46:19.519
<i>I only know that I learnt
not to fight every battle.</i>

46:19.521 --> 46:24.326
I am like a reed that bends in stiff
wind, but doesn't snap.

46:24.767 --> 46:27.808
Here I am.
I haven't snapped.

46:27.810 --> 46:30.332
What was the price
you paid?

46:31.814 --> 46:33.974
<i>Did your mother
never tell you</i>

46:33.976 --> 46:37.378
<i>what was done
to bring you here?</i>

46:37.380 --> 46:39.980
Nor Lady Pole,
when you saw her?

46:39.982 --> 46:43.226
Lady Pole retreats
upon sight of me.

46:44.868 --> 46:47.228
Your mother
would only pledge your hand

46:47.230 --> 46:50.151
if there were none to challenge
Arthur for the throne,

46:50.153 --> 46:51.633
so two young men were...

46:51.635 --> 46:53.635
they were put to death,

46:53.637 --> 46:57.719
one of them an imposter,

46:57.721 --> 47:01.202
the other a beloved boy
from our family,

47:01.204 --> 47:03.645
<i>Edward Plantagenet,
Earl of Warrick.</i>

47:03.647 --> 47:06.648
<i>He was Maggie Pole's brother,
simple soul,</i>

47:06.650 --> 47:08.290
<i>a child in his mind.</i>

47:08.292 --> 47:10.532
<i>He had no idea
why he had to die.</i>

47:10.534 --> 47:12.094
<i>Perhaps that was
God's mercy on him.</i>

47:12.096 --> 47:13.295
My mother
would not order that.

47:13.297 --> 47:14.857
Oh, but she did.

47:14.859 --> 47:19.301
She would not kill an
innocent, only enemies.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.624
He was beheaded
at the tower,

47:21.626 --> 47:23.866
where you sleep tonight.

47:23.868 --> 47:25.870
Why would you
tell me this...

47:26.871 --> 47:29.113
the night
before my wedding?

47:30.555 --> 47:32.557
Because you need to know
what rests on you,

47:34.239 --> 47:38.641
the hopes of Spain and England
and the Habsburg empire.

47:38.643 --> 47:41.725
We join forces
to unite against our enemies

47:41.727 --> 47:45.769
so that my son is protected on
his throne when we are gone.

47:45.771 --> 47:49.172
And you must give us sons,
Catherine,

47:49.174 --> 47:53.216
no girls, only boys,

47:53.218 --> 47:56.660
heirs, so that the king
may sleep again

47:56.662 --> 48:00.104
and sweetly dream
as he once did.

48:00.106 --> 48:02.188
I know my duty...

48:04.430 --> 48:07.912
but I will not
share your guilt.

48:07.914 --> 48:10.755
If you spill blood,
then it is yours.

48:10.757 --> 48:13.520
There is no guilt...

48:15.321 --> 48:18.082
only love for both my sons.

48:18.084 --> 48:21.806
Do not cross me, Catherine.

48:21.808 --> 48:25.852
There is nothing
I won't do to save my boys...

48:27.854 --> 48:29.857
or to save my love.

48:53.601 --> 48:55.521
L-Lord Stafford
gave me this.

48:55.523 --> 48:58.326
What else
did he give you?

49:03.972 --> 49:07.454
You are not here to throw
yourself on any man you choose.

49:07.456 --> 49:09.336
We will be matched
with husbands.

49:09.338 --> 49:12.619
<i>They will not want you
if you shame yourself.</i>

49:12.621 --> 49:14.623
He is kind.

49:18.827 --> 49:22.189
And he is funny.

49:22.191 --> 49:25.755
He has the soft hands.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.439
I like him.

49:32.441 --> 49:36.083
It is an honor
to attend the Infanta.

49:36.085 --> 49:39.008
<i>You must earn it, Rosa.</i>

49:49.699 --> 49:51.862
Infanta, we must dress
you for your wedding.

49:53.143 --> 49:55.145
More water for my bath.

49:59.149 --> 50:01.792
Infanta, there is
no more room for water.

50:06.997 --> 50:08.797
Go, please.

50:08.799 --> 50:10.881
The Infanta
will have privacy.

50:14.045 --> 50:17.166
Infanta, everything here
in England is strange.

50:17.168 --> 50:19.769
All my life,
I have watched you.

50:19.771 --> 50:23.094
I always knew that I would
serve you as your lady.

50:24.936 --> 50:28.858
One day, I heard you
talking with Señor Colombo.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.980
<i>You asked him
how he knew</i>

50:30.982 --> 50:35.105
<i>he wasn't to sail off the
very edges of the world,</i>

50:35.107 --> 50:38.270
<i>and he smiled at you
and told you...</i>

52:35.552 --> 52:39.115
Hello again, Highness.

52:49.646 --> 52:51.726
Why did you write to me?

52:51.728 --> 52:54.091
Was it to harm
your brother?

52:55.532 --> 52:57.534
At first.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.101
Then I liked your letters.

53:06.103 --> 53:09.625
They excited me.

53:09.627 --> 53:11.629
Then you show
your weakness.

53:12.550 --> 53:14.953
You give me power
over you.

53:16.314 --> 53:18.396
I would never
give my power away.

53:34.773 --> 53:36.373
Daughter of Spain.

53:36.375 --> 53:38.775
Wife to Prince Arthur.

53:38.777 --> 53:40.577
Daughter of Spain.

53:40.579 --> 53:42.821
Wife to Prince Arthur.

53:46.185 --> 53:49.146
<i>Daughter of Spain.</i>

53:49.148 --> 53:51.190
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

53:53.072 --> 53:55.074
<i>Daughter of Spain.</i>

53:56.396 --> 53:58.998
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

54:01.000 --> 54:03.002
<i>Daughter of Spain.</i>

54:04.644 --> 54:08.126
<i>Wife to Prince Arthur.</i>

54:08.128 --> 54:09.407
<i>And soon...</i>

54:09.409 --> 54:11.411
<i>Queen of England.</i>
