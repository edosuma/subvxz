LILY THOMAS: January the 8th, 1963.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.000
Official statement
of Mrs Flora Solomon

00:30.000 --> 00:31.040
Official statement
of Mrs Flora Solomon

00:31.080 --> 00:33.840
of 19 Spencer Square, Kensington.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.880
Erm...

00:48.960 --> 00:51.040
Before I-I begin, erm...

00:53.200 --> 00:59.360
..I'd like to make it clear,
I... I didn't go to MI5.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.000
You came to me.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.720
You came to me.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.240
All because of
a private conversation...

01:07.480 --> 01:11.040
..or at least one that
I was lead to believe was private...

01:11.080 --> 01:12.800
with a friend.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.560
And, as unlikely as it may sound,

01:19.600 --> 01:24.120
I have known Kim Philby
for a very long time...

01:25.080 --> 01:26.320
..and, erm...

01:27.720 --> 01:30.000
..I simply didn't put...
two and two to...

01:30.000 --> 01:31.520
..I simply didn't put...
two and two to...

01:33.200 --> 01:35.000
I still can't quite believe that...

01:38.200 --> 01:42.360
I very much regret
that it has taken me all these years

01:42.400 --> 01:45.120
to realise who he really is...

01:48.600 --> 01:52.560
..and the despicable, hateful things
he's done.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.600
PAPER RUSTLES

02:11.240 --> 02:12.360
I'm sorry, Nick.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.840
I know you always considered Kim
a close... I'm fine.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.200
DOOR OPENS

02:18.240 --> 02:19.600
Fine.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.440
You should know,
Mrs Solomon's statement to MI5

02:24.480 --> 02:27.880
is the final piece of the puzzle
that confirms everything

02:27.920 --> 02:30.000
that Golitsyn told us when
he defected in Helsinki last year.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.920
that Golitsyn told us when
he defected in Helsinki last year.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.200
I read his debrief file.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.640
He only ever mentioned
an unidentified Soviet agent.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.800
I have a team standing by
to go to Beirut first thing.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.960
But what you're now telling me
is that, in fact,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.680
Golitsyn specifically identified Kim

02:46.720 --> 02:48.760
as the traitor?
PHONE RINGS

02:52.640 --> 02:57.040
A team from MI5?
That'll never fucking work.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.440
CAR HORNS BEEP,
PEOPLE CHATTER

03:04.600 --> 03:07.680
Kim has to be handled by SIS,
not MI5.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
That would be madness.
And by "SIS"...

03:11.840 --> 03:14.960
I mean me.
Utter bloody madness.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.320
'I disagree, Sir Roger.'

03:20.360 --> 03:22.560
Philby must, for the time being,

03:22.600 --> 03:25.320
be viewed and treated
as a potential asset.

03:25.360 --> 03:29.080
He must be handled with care
by an SIS man

03:29.120 --> 03:30.000
for foreign intelligence purposes,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
for foreign intelligence purposes,

03:31.040 --> 03:33.960
not arrested by MI5
for criminal prosecution.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.920
Forgive me, but... ten years ago,
when MI5 suspected Philby

03:38.960 --> 03:41.520
of helping Burgess and Maclean
escape to Moscow,

03:41.560 --> 03:43.680
you, as I recall...

03:44.720 --> 03:46.720
..were his staunchest ally.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.880
So, I'll say it again -

03:48.920 --> 03:52.680
sending you to Beirut
would be a colossal mistake.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

04:10.240 --> 04:11.440
Hello, Kim.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.560
I rather thought it would be you.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.400
CAR HORNS BEEP

05:27.080 --> 05:29.000
Bet you wish
you were still in Beirut.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.880
E! Zakhodim v port.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.720
We can send a man...
into space, but...

06:33.760 --> 06:34.960
Ah.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.800
I wouldn't shut that all the way
again if I were you.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.880
Oh, right. Well, is there
another room I can use...?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.480
It's the damp.
Expands the wood, see.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.000
This is all there is, I'm afraid.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.400

Spoil the surprise.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
'Nice try, though.'

07:21.480 --> 07:24.000
Go.
'We'll get through this.

Uh-oh. Don't tell me - we lost.
What?

08:52.560 --> 08:54.560
The cricket, Tim, the cricket.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.000
Actually, it was a draw.
England were 223 for four.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.040
Actually, it was a draw.
England were 223 for four.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.000
Thanks to Barrington, who was 134,
not out. Hm.

You think I'd know by now.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.600
Mr Elliott.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.400
It's been like that as long as I can
remember. You must be Mrs Thomas...

09:17.440 --> 09:19.520
How do you do?
..of MI5 fame.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.960
Hardly.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.120
Ah...
What?

09:23.160 --> 09:25.200
We need another chair.
Hello?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.200
How do you do?
Hello.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.440
Tim Milne.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.200
My instructions are to debrief
Mr Elliott alone. Ah.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.960
Well, what you need to understand,
Mrs Thomas,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.880
is that Mr Elliott is one of
SIS's most respected officers,

09:43.920 --> 09:46.520
and C has asked me to sit in

09:46.560 --> 09:48.720
and make sure that everything is,
er...

09:50.280 --> 09:51.880
..you know...
Tickety-boo.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.800
May I speak freely?
In this building (?)

09:55.840 --> 09:58.040
My orders are
to debrief Mr Elliott alone

09:58.080 --> 10:00.000
with no SIS involvement
or assistance,

10:00.000 --> 10:00.240
with no SIS involvement
or assistance,

10:00.280 --> 10:05.680
but should you need clarification,
I'm to ask you to...

10:06.800 --> 10:08.280
..call this number.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.960
Before you go,
is there someone here...

10:16.160 --> 10:18.240
..who might be able to do something
about that door?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.080
There's a good fella.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.200
Mr Elliott, I'd like to begin
by saying how sorry I am.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.040
I realise how painful this must be
for you and everyone else here

10:38.080 --> 10:41.000
at the Intelligence Service
who counted Mr Philby as a friend...

10:42.200 --> 10:44.440
..and trusted colleague...

10:45.960 --> 10:47.920
..for such an awfully long time.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.880
Is that Northumberland I hear?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.920
You and Mr Philby were friends
for, what, 25 years?

11:00.480 --> 11:01.760
23.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.920
Could you please explain to me how
he was able to escape from Beirut?

11:06.960 --> 11:08.360
Smart money's on a boat.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.320
No, thank you.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.320
Newcastle...

11:20.400 --> 11:21.440
..the accent?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.840
Mr Elliott...

11:24.000 --> 11:26.880
..I completely understand
why you might need a moment or two

11:26.920 --> 11:29.360
to break the ice - believe me, I do.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.280
Would you mind
if we now consider it broken?

11:39.920 --> 11:43.560
The word "escape"...
would suggest that

11:43.600 --> 11:48.160
Philby was in some sort
of custody, which he was not.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.160
But I do understand
the drive of your question,

11:50.200 --> 11:53.400
and the answer is this -
I simply didn't think he'd run.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.400
I was offering him complete immunity
and secrecy,

11:57.440 --> 12:00.000
with a nice little retirement in the
country with his wife and children,

12:00.000 --> 12:00.960
with a nice little retirement in the
country with his wife and children,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.920
for a full confession of everything
he ever did for the KGB.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.160
I didn't for a moment think
he'd choose Russia over that.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.600
Durham. My accent.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.760
Ah. Mr Elliott, you are aware
that we have all the...

12:17.840 --> 12:23.320
..34 hours of recordings
of you and Philby in that flat?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
ON TAPE: 'Hello, Kim.'

12:30.000 --> 12:30.040
ON TAPE: 'Hello, Kim.'

12:31.920 --> 12:33.760
PHILBY: 'I rather thought
it would be you.'

12:34.880 --> 12:37.280
What did he mean by that,
"I rather thought it would be you"?

12:38.960 --> 12:41.200
I don't know.
If you were to guess?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.760
Well, that would be playing
his game,

12:43.800 --> 12:46.920
and I'd sooner not do that
at this juncture. Game?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.640
'Come on in.'

12:55.440 --> 12:56.800
DOOR CLOSES

13:02.440 --> 13:04.040
Can I offer you some tea?

13:05.560 --> 13:07.640
You look a little peaky.
How's your health?

13:07.680 --> 13:10.320
Oh, it's... perfectly tolerable,

13:10.360 --> 13:14.000
despite recent bouts of flu
AND bronchitis.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.480
Oh, nasty.
Yes, they were both against me.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.320
Ah, little did they know.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.800
I must say, I'd rather hoped "tea"

13:24.840 --> 13:26.920
was code for something
a little stronger.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.040
LIQUID POURING

13:34.600 --> 13:37.640
Kim, I don't have time
to postpone this and...

13:37.680 --> 13:40.480
we've known each other forever,
so...

13:40.520 --> 13:42.480
if you don't mind,
I'll get right to the point.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.040
Oh, bloody hell.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.000
Would you believe it?
I've left my pipe at home.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.480
Ah...

13:50.400 --> 13:51.680
Ah, good man.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.880
I came to tell you that your past
has caught up with you.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.200
Oh?

14:10.520 --> 14:12.600
We found additional information
about you

14:12.640 --> 14:14.080
that puts everything in place.

14:15.360 --> 14:20.160
And now... even I'm convinced,
absolutely convinced...

14:22.200 --> 14:24.560
..that you worked for
the Soviet intelligence service...

14:27.600 --> 14:29.560
..right up until the end of the war.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.480
TAPE DECK CLICKS

14:34.520 --> 14:36.520
Within the first few minutes
of the tape,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.320
you state loud and clear,
as if for the record

14:38.360 --> 14:40.240
and anybody else
who might be listening,

14:40.280 --> 14:43.480
that he stopped spying for
the Soviets at the end of the war.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.480
Yes.
Did he?

14:50.240 --> 14:51.560
So, that was a lie.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.800
A nuance...
A nuance.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.120
..to protect the relationship
with our American cousins

14:59.160 --> 15:00.000
who, I assumed,
had to be listening...

15:00.000 --> 15:00.680
who, I assumed,
had to be listening...

15:00.720 --> 15:02.920
Not as far as I know.
..or would get hold of the tape.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.080
Again, to my knowledge...

15:04.120 --> 15:07.960
Because if they ever discovered
that he had been active for the KGB

15:08.000 --> 15:09.760
all the way up to now,

15:09.800 --> 15:13.520
especially during his stint
in Washington from '49 to '51...

15:13.560 --> 15:16.640
They'd be out for blood.
Not just HIS blood.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.320
So, am I right in saying
that you were letting him know

15:20.360 --> 15:23.200
from the beginning you were willing
to protect him from the Americans?

15:24.600 --> 15:28.440
I'd... rather like to think
of it as protecting the service...

15:30.720 --> 15:33.680
And the country.
..whilst, at the same time...

15:34.760 --> 15:37.320
..trying to offer him
every incentive to tell the truth.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.040
By the way, why wasn't he
in some sort of custody?

15:42.760 --> 15:43.800
Well, that's not how we...

15:49.480 --> 15:51.200
I was trying to appeal
to his better nature.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.360
As an Englishman.
And husband.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.560
And father.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.400
How did you and he first meet?

16:00.640 --> 16:02.960
Not sure what that has to do
with what happened in Beirut.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.760
Oh, er, wh-what happened
in Beirut...

16:06.800 --> 16:09.680
..erm, is that the most dangerous
Soviet penetration agent

16:09.720 --> 16:12.520
this country's ever known legged it
on your watch.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.960
Odds are to the Soviet Union,
who, just a few months ago,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.960
aimed missiles at America from Cuba.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.960
So we - you and I -

16:21.000 --> 16:23.440
are gonna look into
every single nook and cranny

16:23.480 --> 16:25.360
of yours and Philby's friendship.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.040
ANNOUNCEMENT
OVER TANNOY

16:47.440 --> 16:49.760
METAL DOOR SLIDES

16:54.320 --> 16:56.520
How do you do, Comrade Philby?

16:56.560 --> 16:59.360
Or I should say... Agent Stanley?

17:00.600 --> 17:01.680
I'm Sergei.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.760
May I...?

17:16.640 --> 17:19.760
I'd like to begin with an apology.
Is not necessary.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.600
Even so...

17:21.640 --> 17:24.320
You are sorry
that your hand was forced in Beirut

17:24.360 --> 17:27.160
and that you had to escape
to Soviet Union.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.080
Actually,
what I'd like to apologise...

17:29.120 --> 17:30.000
I say... apology is not necessary.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.680
I say... apology is not necessary.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.680
First... you are KGB hero
for work as penetration agent

17:42.720 --> 17:46.320
into British and American
intelligence since '34.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.400
'33.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.160
Second...
we keep you active too long.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.880
In all honesty, I would've liked
to have gone on forever.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.000
And to never leave England.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.320
And to never leave England.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.280
To never underestimating
the English again.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.560
I first met him in 1940.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.040
'At my club.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.000
'My closest childhood chum
had just been shot down and killed

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
'My closest childhood chum

18:32.040 --> 18:33.400
'by the Luftwaffe.'

18:37.040 --> 18:39.320
The first thing I noticed about Kim

18:39.360 --> 18:42.520
was that he had this capacity
to draw people in...

18:42.560 --> 18:45.400
and sort of appeared,
just in how he carried himself,

18:45.440 --> 18:47.560
to know things no-one else knew...

18:47.600 --> 18:49.400
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

18:49.440 --> 18:50.680
Thank you, sir.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.200
'..exuding what I can only describe
as this very British confidence

18:54.240 --> 18:56.400
'that everything would be all right
in the end.'

18:56.440 --> 18:57.440
They were not in any...

18:57.480 --> 18:59.560
EXPLOSION

19:03.840 --> 19:08.240
That was, as it happens,
the first night of the Blitz.

You couldn't scare us up
a couple of pink gins, could you?

19:54.080 --> 19:56.840
Are you a member, sir?
What?

19:56.880 --> 19:59.120
I'm sorry, sir,
only members are allowed to...

19:59.160 --> 20:00.000
Put it on my bill, Sam.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.520
Put it on my bill, Sam.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
He didn't seem
at all rattled by the near miss.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.080
Which I have to say at the time
was really rather reassuring.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.480
Kim Philby.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.680
Do you think Philby
was playing you...

20:15.720 --> 20:18.040
from the very first moment
that you met?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.480
No.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.360
I don't know.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.800
You didn't ask him that in Beirut?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.120
That would've been the first thing
I'd have asked him...

20:30.160 --> 20:31.440
..if I hadn't killed him first.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.880
So...

20:38.760 --> 20:43.520
..why it was so easy for you
to escape SIS in Beirut?

20:44.560 --> 20:47.120
I wouldn't exactly call it "easy".

20:47.160 --> 20:48.400
'Mr Philby?'

20:51.160 --> 20:53.840
Mr Philby? Sir?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.000
Breakfast.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.000
From... a friend.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.920
After I received the warning
in Beirut from Moscow Centre,

21:23.960 --> 21:28.280
I first had to see if there was
a way to weather the storm.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.000
'After all, ten years ago, I managed
to survive a full-force hurricane...

21:30.000 --> 21:33.120
'After all, ten years ago, I managed

21:34.360 --> 21:37.800

PHONE RINGS

21:45.080 --> 21:46.400
Philby.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.880
Oh, hello, Peter.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.320
No, no, no, wide awake.

21:54.360 --> 21:59.680
The next morning, Peter Lunne,
our Beirut station chief,

21:59.720 --> 22:00.000
he rang to invite me to tea that
afternoon at his secretary's flat,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.240
he rang to invite me to tea that
afternoon at his secretary's flat,

22:05.280 --> 22:09.720
which, as I'm sure you know,
is code for one of the safe houses.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.200
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:19.680 --> 22:22.040
But when Nicholas Elliott
opened the door,

22:22.080 --> 22:24.720
I'll admit, I was caught
more than a little off-guard.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.720
I rather thought it would be you.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.080
Come on in.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.520
He looked like he wanted to kill me.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.000
And four days later, you confess?

22:39.040 --> 22:41.320
That's not exactly
how I'd put it, no.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.280
A typed, signed confession, no?

22:44.320 --> 22:47.720
After four days
of denying everything...

22:47.760 --> 22:51.400
and getting nowhere,
I felt my time was running out.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.080
I needed to give him something
to get him to drop his guard.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.640
So, yes, I signed, which you would
know, if you'd actually seen it,

22:57.680 --> 23:00.000
what amounted to
a few pages of chicken feed.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.080
what amounted to
a few pages of chicken feed.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.880
No more.

23:01.920 --> 23:05.040
To give myself an opening,
a chance to make a move

23:05.080 --> 23:08.560
before this whole...
bloody nightmare got any worse.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.520
Why did they send Elliott to Beirut?

23:24.240 --> 23:26.240
Knowing him,
he talked them into it.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.920
Since 1940.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.840
When you were both already in SIS?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.960
Different sections.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.320
I ran operations
in the Iberian Peninsular,

24:22.360 --> 24:23.560
he covered Holland.

24:25.040 --> 24:29.040
Friends... for over 20 years.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.560
Not easy.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.640
Requires a certain
attention to detail, I suppose.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.600
Hard to believe he never suspected.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.720
You must understand...

24:44.760 --> 24:47.920
A friendship
within the British ruling class...

24:47.960 --> 24:52.120
it's built on an ingrained belief
that victory over one's enemy

24:52.160 --> 24:55.360
is preordained, God given.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.360
When you think about it,
it's really remarkable,

24:57.400 --> 25:00.000
the... the level of sentimentality
and arrogance that it must take

25:00.000 --> 25:02.480
the... the level of sentimentality
and arrogance that it must take

25:02.520 --> 25:05.240
in order to be so wilfully blind

25:05.280 --> 25:08.880

own might see things differently.

KIM CHUCKLES

25:34.600 --> 25:36.520
Why did you let him go?

25:36.560 --> 25:39.520
I didn't. He ran.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.760
At night.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.600
He waited until after dark.
That's all it took?

25:43.640 --> 25:45.040
Do you not think that in hindsight,

25:45.080 --> 25:47.240
perhaps MI5 should've gone
to Beirut, not you?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.440
Kim gave me an eight-page,
signed confession,

25:49.480 --> 25:52.160
that he never would've given
anyone from MI5.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.160
Ooh, right, yeah.
Sorry, you mean this?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.760
Yeah.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.720
Er... Yeah.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.000
Isn't this what you SIS chaps call,
er... "chicken feed"?

26:00.000 --> 26:05.040
Isn't this what you SIS chaps call,
er... "chicken feed"?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.840
Or is there something
you're not telling me?

26:08.320 --> 26:12.680
When I...
grasped the scope of his betrayal...

26:13.800 --> 26:17.640
..I realised that our friendship
had led, over the years, to...

26:19.600 --> 26:21.040
..the deaths of hundreds...

26:23.280 --> 26:26.080
..possibly thousands of people
at the hands of the Soviets.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.200
Try to imagine for a moment,
if you will...

26:38.840 --> 26:41.520
..how that might feel, and...

26:47.600 --> 26:50.880
..give me one good reason
why I'd deliberately let him go.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.840
I can give you several.
Firstly, you were friends for years.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.240
Second, there's his wife
and children, not to mention SIS,

26:56.280 --> 26:59.240
all of whom I'm sure you wanted
to protect from a public scandal.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.000
So I have to ask if the two of you
came to some sort of quid pro quo

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
So I have to ask if the two of you
came to some sort of quid pro quo

27:04.040 --> 27:06.400

29:29.600 --> 29:31.160
In 1951...

29:32.680 --> 29:35.920
..you helped Comrades Burgess
and Maclean escape from the West

29:35.960 --> 29:38.120
to the Soviet Union.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.720
In a manner of speaking.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.440
At great... personal risk.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.960
When I found out the codebreakers
were onto Maclean,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.960
there was no indication
Burgess was also blown.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.360
Maclean had no choice.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.000
He was blown. He had to run -
no question about it.

29:53.000 --> 29:53.920
He was blown. He had to run -
no question about it.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.880
Burgess, on the other hand,
he was safe.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.520
But he panicked
and decided to run anyway.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.120
And because he'd just been
my house guest in America,

30:06.160 --> 30:08.200
drying out for a couple of months...

30:08.240 --> 30:10.400
The British suspected
you were also a... traitor?

30:25.320 --> 30:27.240
in the disappearance

30:27.280 --> 30:30.440
The 43-year-old
former Foreign Office diplomat

30:30.480 --> 30:32.280

30:32.320 --> 30:34.720

outside the Commons.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.280
Mr Philby.
Mr MacMillan, the Foreign Secretary,

30:38.320 --> 30:41.080
said there was no evidence that
you were the so-called "Third Man"

30:41.120 --> 30:43.640
who allegedly tipped off
Burgess and Maclean.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.640
Are you satisfied with
that clearance that he gave you?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.040
Yes, I am.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.120
Well, if there WAS a third man,
were you, in fact, the third man?

30:52.160 --> 30:53.000
No, I was not.
Do you think there was one?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.640
No, I was not.
Do you think there was one?

30:54.680 --> 30:56.080
No comment.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.640
Mr Philby, the disappearance
of Burgess and Maclean

30:59.680 --> 31:02.840
is almost as much of a mystery today
as it was when they went away -

31:02.880 --> 31:04.960
about four years ago or more.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.360
Can you shed any light on it at all?

31:07.400 --> 31:08.880
No, I can't.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.920
In the first place, I'm debarred
by the Official Secrets Act

31:23.000 --> 31:26.480
In the second place,
the Burgess-Maclean affair

31:26.520 --> 31:30.120
has raised issues of great delicacy

31:30.160 --> 31:32.720
in the sphere
of international affairs.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.040
And the Foreign Secretary
has said that in the past,

31:35.080 --> 31:37.040
you had communist associations.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.600
Is that why
you were asked to resign?

31:39.640 --> 31:42.960
I was asked to resign
because of an imprudent association.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.120
That was your association
with Burgess. Correct.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.680
What about these alleged
communist associations?

31:48.720 --> 31:51.320
Can you say anything about them?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.000
The last time
I spoke to a communist,

31:53.000 --> 31:53.920
The last time
I spoke to a communist,

31:53.960 --> 31:57.480
knowing him to be a communist,
was sometime in 1934.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.840
That rather implies that you've also
spoken to communists unknowingly

32:00.880 --> 32:02.640
and you now know about it.

32:02.680 --> 32:07.520
Well, I spoke to Burgess last
in April or May of 1951.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.640
Would you still regard Burgess,
who...

32:09.680 --> 32:11.440
lived with you
for a while in Washington,

32:11.480 --> 32:14.000
would you still regard him
as a friend of yours?

32:14.040 --> 32:15.320
How do you feel about him now?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.760
I consider his action deplorable.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.600
On the subject of friendship,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.000
I prefer to say
as little as possible,

32:23.000 --> 32:23.120
I prefer to say
as little as possible,

32:23.160 --> 32:25.040
because it's very complicated.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.120
A virtuoso performance.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.480
Good God.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.560
Are you suggesting
what I think you are?

32:35.600 --> 32:39.480
What really happened in Beirut
between you and Nicholas Elliott?

32:39.520 --> 32:43.560
You are. You're calling me a liar.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.560
Who will go down in history.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.400
DOOR OPENS,
CLOSES

33:11.560 --> 33:14.000
Eternal Father...

33:14.040 --> 33:19.080
whose son Jesus Christ
was sent to the throne of Heaven...

33:19.120 --> 33:23.000
that he might rule over all things

33:23.000 --> 33:23.080
that he might rule over all things

33:23.120 --> 33:25.640
as Lord and King...

33:26.720 --> 33:30.400
..keep the church in the unity
of the spirit

33:30.440 --> 33:33.680
and in the bond of peace...

33:33.720 --> 33:39.320
and bring the whole created order
to worship at his feet,

33:39.360 --> 33:46.160
who is alive and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.440
One God, now and forever.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.840
Amen.
CONGREGATION: Amen.

33:52.880 --> 33:53.000
And now will you join me
in the Lord's Prayer?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.760
And now will you join me
in the Lord's Prayer?

33:58.480 --> 34:02.080
CONGREGATION: Our Father
Which art in heaven

34:03.600 --> 34:05.400
Hallowed be thy name

34:06.440 --> 34:09.280
Thy kingdom come

34:09.320 --> 34:11.920
Thy will be done

34:11.960 --> 34:14.440
On Earth as it is in heaven...

34:14.480 --> 34:15.560
KNOCK ON DOOR

34:18.880 --> 34:21.920
Thought you might like a cuppa.
Thank you.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.560
DOOR CLOSES

34:33.440 --> 34:34.480
Mm, just a drop.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.840
WHISPERS: Sorry. Thank you.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.000
I'm diabetic.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.080
Sometimes,
I forget to take my medicine -

34:48.120 --> 34:50.680
don't tell my wife -
and gets the better of me.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.400
We were talking about...
I know what we were talking about.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.880
Squashed fly?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.840
Thank you.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.240
DISTANT CHURCH BELLS

35:14.680 --> 35:17.000
There was no quid pro quo.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.960
No final act of friendship.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.240
No.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.240
SHE HUMS

35:34.960 --> 35:36.680
What made you go into intelligence?

35:38.320 --> 35:41.440
We were on the brink of war,
and I wanted to do my bit...

35:41.480 --> 35:44.520
without doing all that marching
and square-bashing,

35:44.560 --> 35:46.800
if at all... possible.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.880
I won't have time
to get to the shops today...

35:51.120 --> 35:52.640
..and my husband always forgets.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.280
SHE GRUNTS

35:58.520 --> 36:03.280
When I was seven, my parents
sent me off to boarding school.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.280
A brutal place that reeked
of floor polish and custard.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.800
Sometimes, at night,
when everyone was asleep,

36:08.840 --> 36:10.680
I'd climb out on the roofs,

36:10.720 --> 36:12.960
where I'd imagine that
I was the Count of Monte Cristo...

36:14.520 --> 36:18.240
..and plot my enemies' downfall
by means of surveillance,

36:18.280 --> 36:20.720
disinformation, sabotage.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.680
Why did Philby spy for the Russians?

36:25.720 --> 36:29.640
Espionage can at times be...
intoxicating.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.880
'But where the thrill
of fooling your enemy

36:33.920 --> 36:35.880
'might be enough for most of us,

36:35.920 --> 36:38.360
'it is not, it appears,
sufficient for Kim.'

36:39.480 --> 36:43.640
Double-crossing your friends,
lying to your fellow spies...

36:44.960 --> 36:46.200
..must have been...

36:49.640 --> 36:51.440
JOVIAL CHATTER

36:53.720 --> 36:54.880
GLASS CLINKS

36:56.480 --> 36:58.000
APPLAUSE

36:58.040 --> 37:00.560
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

37:00.600 --> 37:02.880
Ah, Elliott, oh, hold on.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.440
EXAGGERATED BRITISH ACCENT:
Oh, Elliott, oh, just the fellow.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.920
Please, have a seat.
I would like a frank word with you.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.240
Certainly, sir.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.840
Does your wife know what you do?
Yes.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.320
Er, how did that come about?

37:16.360 --> 37:17.960
Well, she was my secretary
for two years,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.600
and I think the penny
must have dropped.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.280
Yes, quite so, quite, quite.
And what about your mother?

37:22.320 --> 37:23.000
She thinks I work for something
called SIS,

37:23.000 --> 37:24.760
She thinks I work for something
called SIS,

37:24.800 --> 37:27.560
which she believes stands for
Secret Intelligence Service.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.080
Good God!
How did she come to know that?

37:30.120 --> 37:33.760
A war cabinet... A member...
LAUGHTER

37:33.800 --> 37:36.160
A war cabinet fell on her
at a cocktail party.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.400
Oh, goodness! That must've caused
all sorts of damage.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.200
A member of the war cabinet
told her at a cocktail party.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.040
LAUGHTER

37:43.080 --> 37:45.040
It's true. It's actually true.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.240
But he IS a communist?
Oh. Chicken, egg...

37:55.640 --> 37:56.640
Please.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.440
That does not look like enemies
to me.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.080
The reason, by the way,
I don't like the word "traitor"

38:05.120 --> 38:07.400
is because
I'm not a fucking traitor.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.480
I've been loyal to Marxism
and to the Soviet Union

38:10.520 --> 38:11.720
my entire adult life.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.200
What were you talking about here?
I don't know.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.600
All I remember is it was getting
rather stuffy in that flat.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.440
It was seven days ago.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.000
We were drinking every day, and
Nicholas is nothing if not witty.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.920
We were drinking every day, and
Nicholas is nothing if not witty.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.240
Witty?

38:30.800 --> 38:34.600
He obviously knew
the KGB were watching

38:34.640 --> 38:38.720
and wanted to plant exactly
these seeds of doubt in your mind.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.840
And there?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.800
I don't remember.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.000
You know what it looks like to me?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.200
You know what it looks like to me?

38:54.240 --> 38:57.640
I think you say...
"partners in crime".

38:59.120 --> 39:03.480
For God's sake, man, I have not been
turned by British intelligence.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.880
I had to run,
otherwise, they would've killed me.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.000
I had no other option.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.240
Do you seriously think
I wanted to come here?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.080
I'm sorry.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.000
Slip of the tongue.

39:23.000 --> 39:23.120
Slip of the tongue.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.080
BRIEFCASE CLASPS CLICK

39:36.760 --> 39:41.160
I don't believe you've ever had
a slip of the tongue, comrade.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.600
DOOR CLANGS SHUT

39:55.080 --> 39:58.480
By "quid pro quo", what I mean is...
I'm familiar with the term.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.560
..maybe you let him go
in exchange for something?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.360
Some important piece
of information...

40:02.400 --> 40:04.160
that might resurrect your career?

40:04.200 --> 40:08.200
Wouldn't that be nice?
Or, God forbid, protect England.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.800
I didn't let him go.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.600
On the last day,
you both go out onto the balcony.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.560
For four consecutive days,
you meet in that flat

40:14.600 --> 40:15.920
for roughly eight hours a day.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.720
Only once do you go out
onto the balcony,

40:17.760 --> 40:19.480
for a sum total
of about three minutes.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:23.000 --> 40:23.400
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:24.360 --> 40:25.800

for you, miss.'

40:28.400 --> 40:30.120
Oh, right. Erm...

40:31.320 --> 40:32.920
Yeah, hold on a minute, please.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.560
I wanted Kim's Russian friends,
if they were out there,

40:40.600 --> 40:43.040
to see him and me together.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.200
Hm.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.840
Were you aware
that the bug in the flat

40:50.880 --> 40:52.480
couldn't hear you
out on the balcony?

40:52.520 --> 40:53.000
Can't say I gave it much thought.
In other words, you didn't care.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.080
Can't say I gave it much thought.
In other words, you didn't care.

40:55.120 --> 41:00.320
What I... cared about
was getting Kim to tell the truth.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.840
DOOR CLANKS
Hold on, Ted!

41:02.960 --> 41:04.680
Am I under arrest?
No.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.040
Good.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.560
Cos my wife's arranged tickets
for the theatre tonight.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.240
Oh...

41:11.280 --> 41:13.440
What are you gonna see?
She's surprising me.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.240
Apparently, I need cheering up.

41:37.240 --> 41:40.400
MAN: Kensington Palace Gardens,
please. Russian Embassy.

41:55.320 --> 41:58.160
'Your typical SIS man,
as we all know,

41:58.200 --> 42:00.600
'concurrent with his upbringing,

42:00.640 --> 42:04.320
'considers himself to be
part of a secret, elite club,

42:04.360 --> 42:06.360
'which, by design, has no rules.

42:06.400 --> 42:12.240
'Because rules... by design,
are strictly for commoners...

42:12.280 --> 42:15.240
'like us here at MI5.'

42:15.280 --> 42:20.000
In many ways, SIS's real enemy
is a change to the status quo

42:20.040 --> 42:23.640
that might, erm... threaten
the existence of their club.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.000
So for them, Philby's worst crime

42:24.000 --> 42:26.360
So for them, Philby's worst crime

42:26.400 --> 42:28.080
is that he broke
their one unwritten rule,

42:28.120 --> 42:29.960
which is that no member
should ever do anything

42:30.000 --> 42:33.480
that might expose them all
to the scrutiny of the peasants...

42:33.520 --> 42:36.120
Or, God forbid, a woman.

42:37.240 --> 42:42.240
So I wonder if Mr Elliott insisted
he be the one to go to Beirut

42:42.280 --> 42:44.840
so that he and Philby could find
or...

42:44.880 --> 42:46.240
Thank you.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.320
..create some sort
of last-minute save.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.120
DOOR CLOSES

42:52.160 --> 42:53.440
For example...

42:56.240 --> 42:58.840
..what if he went out there
to initiate...

42:58.880 --> 43:01.280
an operation
to run Philby back at the KGB?

43:02.360 --> 43:04.160
Bloody hell, you actually mean that.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.320
For our old friend.

43:24.480 --> 43:28.120
I'm sorry, I just don't believe...
That SIS are that devious?

43:28.160 --> 43:30.840
If they were running Philby back
into the USSR, they'd have told us.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.240
Well, that's sweet, Arthur.
Quite unlike you.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.280
Or at the very least,

43:35.320 --> 43:37.360
one would think
they'd have asked us to back off.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.520
Leave Elliott alone.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.480
What if he didn't even tell SIS
what he was up to?

44:20.640 --> 44:21.880
Taxi's here.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.880
You look stunning.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.040
You lost him? How?

45:20.080 --> 45:21.960
He's a pro, for sure.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.000
He gave me the slip in the church.
Switched hat and coat.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.880
He gave me the slip in the church.
Switched hat and coat.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.480
Now he's in the fucking wind.
Long gone.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.880
Which means he almost certainly
is not.

I totally lost track.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I'm so sorry,
you must be starving.

Flu season, you know?

47:57.520 --> 47:59.440
And with all the long waits
these days,

47:59.480 --> 48:03.440
which can be up to ten times
as long for my patients,

48:03.480 --> 48:06.960

Stew left over from the other day.

48:21.120 --> 48:24.000
VIOLIN: 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?'

48:24.000 --> 48:25.320
VIOLIN: 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?'

48:37.480 --> 48:40.120
BAND JOINS IN

48:40.160 --> 48:42.360
LAUGHTER

48:42.400 --> 48:46.040
# Are you lonesome tonight?

48:47.320 --> 48:52.160
# Do you miss me tonight?

48:52.200 --> 48:54.000
# Oh! Are you sorry

48:54.000 --> 48:55.560
# Oh! Are you sorry

48:55.600 --> 48:58.920
# We... We drifted apart? #

48:58.960 --> 49:02.280
What you doing?
Well, I-I'm singing, aren't I?

49:02.320 --> 49:03.760
# Are you... #

49:07.960 --> 49:10.040
INHALES SHARPLY

49:29.120 --> 49:31.520
LAUGHTER
MAN: Boom!

49:31.560 --> 49:33.080
Give 'em an "ooh", Sid.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.680
Ooh!
LAUGHTER

49:35.720 --> 49:37.880
Didn't wanna part with that,
did you?

49:37.920 --> 49:42.120
I'll give you a two-in, here we go.
A one... two...

49:42.160 --> 49:44.160
A boom. Ooh!
Ya-ta-ta-tah.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.320
A boom. Ooh!
Ya-ta-ta-tah.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.920
# Are you lonesome tonight? #
A boom. Ooh! Ya-ta-ta-tah.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.800
# Do you miss me tonight? #
A boom. Ooh! Ya-ta-ta-tah.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.000
# Are you sorry we drifted... #
Just... Just... No, stop!

49:54.000 --> 49:58.440
# Are you sorry we drifted... #
Just... Just... No, stop!

49:58.480 --> 49:59.840
Boom!

49:59.880 --> 50:01.720
A boom...

50:01.760 --> 50:04.360
A boom.
Just a little.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.280
I'm ya-ta-ta-tah-ing, you see.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.080
Oh, of course.
No, you shouldn't be.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.080
No, I should be singing
Are You Lonesome Tonight?

50:10.120 --> 50:12.080
Cos you've got the sideboards.
You're the star.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.120
I go right down to here.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.920
There's something gone wrong
with the star.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.240
Oh, I know!

50:16.280 --> 50:20.280
Sid - you start us off.
Give us the one-two, will you?

50:20.320 --> 50:23.320
Then you'll be all right.
A one, two...

50:23.360 --> 50:24.000
A boom. Ooh.
Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:24.000 --> 50:25.360
A boom. Ooh.
Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:25.400 --> 50:27.080
A boom. Ooh.
Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:27.120 --> 50:30.680
# Are you lonesome tonight?
A boom. Ooh. Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:30.720 --> 50:34.400
# Do you miss me tonight?
A boom. Ooh. Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:34.440 --> 50:40.840
# Are you sorry we drifted apart? #
A boom. Ooh. Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:40.880 --> 50:43.200
A boom. Ooh.
Ya-ta-ta-tah!

50:43.240 --> 50:46.360
PHILBY, SOMBRE:
# Does your memory stray

50:46.400 --> 50:50.280
# To a bright, sunny day

50:50.320 --> 50:52.440
# When I kissed you

50:52.480 --> 50:54.000
# And called you sweetheart?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.160
# And called you sweetheart?

50:58.240 --> 51:01.720
# Do the chairs in your parlour

51:01.760 --> 51:05.680
# Seem empty and bare?

51:05.720 --> 51:09.440
# Do you gaze at your doorstep

51:09.480 --> 51:12.320
# And picture me there?

51:13.400 --> 51:17.720
# Is your heart filled with pain?

51:17.760 --> 51:21.200
# Shall I come back again?

51:21.240 --> 51:23.760
# Tell me, dear

51:23.800 --> 51:24.000
# Are you lonesome tonight? #

51:24.000 --> 51:27.320
# Are you lonesome tonight? #

51:30.920 --> 51:33.640
SILENCE

51:44.680 --> 51:46.200
I interviewed this man today...

51:48.240 --> 51:51.240
It's OK, my love. I know you're
not allowed to talk about your work.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.760
..who's just found out that
his best friend of over 20 years...

51:55.240 --> 51:57.040
..has been betraying him all along.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.240
How long?

52:01.600 --> 52:02.840
23 years.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.760
And he only just found out?

52:25.280 --> 52:28.840
You were spot on. CIA.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.760
Angleton?
James Jesus in the flesh.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.960
Let's keep that
under our hats for now.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.160
Are you trying to get me killed?

53:02.240 --> 53:04.320
Now, there's a thought.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.920
You don't really mean that.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.760
Give me one good reason
why not, Kim.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.040
And it better be a fucking good one.

53:18.880 --> 53:20.040
You know, Nick...

53:21.840 --> 53:24.000
..we're all wondering
what happened in Beirut.

53:24.000 --> 53:24.360
..we're all wondering
what happened in Beirut.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.560
And I for one find it hard to
believe you came back empty-handed.
