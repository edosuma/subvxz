WEBVTT

00:48.220 --> 00:50.540
I'm doing the lake jump this year.

00:50.620 --> 00:51.900
What'd you say?

00:51.940 --> 00:53.780
I'm gonna do the lake jump this year.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.780
That's what I thought you said.
You say that every year.

00:55.860 --> 00:58.140
Yeah, but I mean it this time.

00:58.180 --> 00:59.380
I mean, you only live once, right?

00:59.420 --> 01:00.860
Yeah.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.740
I'm going to climb to the top of big rock
and I'm gonna jump.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.700
You're gonna get up there, man,
you're gonna look down

01:07.740 --> 01:09.820
and you're gonna chicken out,
just like you always do.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.220
You know I don't like heights.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.700
You should do it, Johnny.
It's fun. I even did it.

01:13.780 --> 01:14.940
Yeah, after Brian pushed you.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.100
Still counts.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.420
Hey, you think we'll see
those chicks this year?

01:21.500 --> 01:22.540
Little strip poker.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.420
Probably not, man.
That was Brian hooking that up.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.300
You're gonna get Brian busted.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.420
Dude, like it matters. That was last year.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.460
They weren't even dating.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.820
It's not like it's gonna make a difference to...

02:28.020 --> 02:29.340
- Johnny?
- Scott, you okay?

02:29.420 --> 02:30.860
Yeah, my glasses.

02:31.660 --> 02:32.820
Yeah, I think so.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.020
Nat.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.020
Natalie.

02:42.460 --> 02:43.820
Natalie.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.220
Nat?

02:45.340 --> 02:46.540
- What happened?
- You're okay.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.540
You're okay.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.500
- Where is everybody?
- Look at me. Look at me.

02:49.980 --> 02:51.780
We were in a wreck.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.300
You're not hurt?

02:53.380 --> 02:55.180
I don't think so, baby. What?

02:55.260 --> 02:57.620
- We were in a crash?
- It's okay. It's okay.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.180
- Chris!
- Out here.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.260
- You all right?
- Yeah.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.340
Car isn't.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.100
Go on, I'll help you out, baby.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.620
Any luck?

03:23.700 --> 03:25.260
- Nope.
- Nope?

03:25.340 --> 03:26.260
Nothing.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.740
How long do you think we were out?

03:30.820 --> 03:32.460
I don't know. A few minutes, maybe.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.540
Where do you think Johnny went?

03:38.780 --> 03:41.620
Probably ran up the road looking
for a gas station or something.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.620
You know him, Mr. Boy Scout.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.300
Do you think he went here?

03:54.980 --> 03:56.500
Somebody went here.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.540
How did this happen?

04:15.620 --> 04:18.540
Well, it's just a car, right?
At least everyone's okay.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.580
Yeah, everyone is fine, except Johnny.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.740
No one can find him.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.380
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.140
Is he pissed at me?

04:36.220 --> 04:37.140
No.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.900
He's just pissed that his car is totaled.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.580
No, I mean, the entire time.
He said like two words to me.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.940
- I'm really trying here, baby.
- I know you are, baby.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.580
I know, and you're doing great.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.900
You just got to give him a chance, okay?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.380
- For me?
- Okay.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.260
Look, I'm gonna jog back to the gas station
we stopped at, get a tow truck.

05:17.340 --> 05:20.500
- Alone?
- Yeah, I'll be back in no time. It'll be fine.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.180
- Okay.
- Here we go.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.980
Baby, what's your best mile?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.220
5:47.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.700
Okay, so, the gas station
is like 40 miles away.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.100
So I guess that'll take you like four hours.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.260
Fine, you let me know
when you have a better idea, okay?

05:38.340 --> 05:39.860
Hey, guys.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.780
I think I know where Johnny went.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.820
Are you sure we're gonna need these?

05:49.900 --> 05:52.100
You'll need something long-sleeved
or you'll cut up your arms.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.540
Why can't we just wait
for Johnny to come back with help?

05:55.180 --> 05:57.260
Because Johnny's been gone way too long.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.140
And we need a tow truck before nightfall.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.180
I just...
Listen, I don't want you to go, okay?

06:02.260 --> 06:03.860
I have a bad feeling about this place.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.860
Baby, I'll be right back, okay?

06:07.940 --> 06:09.460
You promise?

06:10.980 --> 06:12.820
I promise.

06:15.900 --> 06:16.820
Bye.

06:17.180 --> 06:19.780
- Are you ready?
- Are you kidding? I love corn.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.020
Watch the road for me, okay?

06:59.580 --> 07:01.460
Hey, you okay?

07:03.980 --> 07:05.580
Track team.

07:05.660 --> 07:06.980
Chess team.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.260
Okay, pal. Come on, you can make it.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.060
How long do you think they'll be?

07:24.140 --> 07:25.460
Don't tell Brian I had one.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.980
Don't tell Brian I gave you one.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.300
- Deal?
- Deal.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.660
Sorry about earlier.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.980
You're right. It's... It's just a car.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.460
Look, it's not that I don't think
your car is important...

07:50.540 --> 07:51.700
No, no, no. You're right.

07:54.980 --> 07:56.700
My granddad used to say,

07:59.700 --> 08:01.660
"Any day above ground is a good day."

08:04.460 --> 08:06.180
I used to hate that saying.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.620
Now, I kind of get it.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.460
It's fine.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.980
Just need a phone.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.500
We'll find someone to tow the car,
catch a ride to the lake house,

08:19.580 --> 08:21.220
and pop open some cold beers.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.100
Yeah, but how do we get back
after the lake house?

08:23.180 --> 08:24.700
I mean, I have to work first thing Monday.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.900
Relax. We'll get a rental. It's no problem.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.940
Hey, hey, I was thinking.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.660
Do you think maybe Natalie can invite
some of her friends?

08:30.740 --> 08:33.140
You know, like that girl
that was at your birthday party.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.260
Do you remember her? She was...
What was her name?

08:35.340 --> 08:37.420
- She was...
- Are we going the right way?

08:38.660 --> 08:41.500
The sun is over...
Yeah, this is the right way.

08:41.540 --> 08:44.420
I think her name was something exotic.
Like Alexandra, maybe.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.060
That's interesting.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.820
Hey, Scott, come check this out.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.940
Brian.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.380
- Yeah.
- Get over here.

09:56.860 --> 09:57.980
Check it out.

10:09.420 --> 10:11.460
Here, boost me up.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.100
What for?

10:18.300 --> 10:21.140
Well, farmers typically place
scarecrows in a grid throughout the field

10:21.180 --> 10:23.060
to help navigate when the corn is too high.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.060
I read a lot.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.820
- Okay.
- Do you see anything?

10:34.620 --> 10:35.660
No.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.340
Don't do that. Don't do that.
You're just like my brother.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.340
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.020
God, this thing smells.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.180
Yeah, we're practically there.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.260
And there's a light on
in the window upstairs.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.260
I think someone's home.

10:51.340 --> 10:52.620
Let's go.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.620
Okay.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.740
Hey. Hey.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.260
Hey, just wait.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.260
- What?
- What happened?

12:21.660 --> 12:22.580
Did you see that?

12:23.060 --> 12:24.020
See what?

12:25.940 --> 12:28.020
There... There was a...

12:28.180 --> 12:31.220
A boy. He was... He was right there. I swear.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.420
Hello.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.500
Anybody home?

13:34.620 --> 13:35.580
Hello?

13:49.660 --> 13:50.900
What do you think?

13:52.820 --> 13:55.060
Well, they're not the best housekeepers.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.140
This is weird.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.500
Yeah, I really don't think anybody lives here.

14:33.820 --> 14:34.740
Hello?

15:41.180 --> 15:42.620
- Hey, are you all right?
- My God!

15:42.660 --> 15:43.780
What happened?

15:43.860 --> 15:44.820
It has teeth.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.140
Is that a person?

15:49.340 --> 15:51.020
- Smells like shit.
- What?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.860
- What is it?
- No, I doubt it's a person.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.300
It looks like a scarecrow.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.820
- It's here to scare birds.
- What the fuck is it doing here?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.580
Shouldn't it be in a field or something?

15:59.740 --> 16:01.980
- Is this what you saw?
- No, I told you.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.020
- I saw a boy.
- Okay.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.500
- He was staring right at me, okay?
- I believe you.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.420
- I told you that.
- Natalie.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.380
Natalie, can you sit down for a minute?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.660
I have to find Brian, okay?
He'll know what to do.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.780
- He'll be back in a minute. He's getting help.
- He doesn't know.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.420
- I have to tell him.
- Tell him what?

16:27.540 --> 16:28.660
There's something wrong, Chris.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.620
Son of a bitch.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.540
Wait up.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.780
Johnny?

18:03.260 --> 18:04.220
Brian!

18:14.140 --> 18:15.060
Natalie!

18:27.860 --> 18:28.820
Brian!

19:24.820 --> 19:25.780
Johnny.

19:26.740 --> 19:27.700
What are you...

19:34.060 --> 19:35.020
Brian!

19:53.860 --> 19:54.900
Hello!

19:58.780 --> 19:59.740
Hello!

20:06.300 --> 20:07.260
Hello!

20:32.620 --> 20:33.700
Natalie!

20:35.100 --> 20:36.140
Natalie!

20:52.900 --> 20:53.860
Natalie!

20:55.300 --> 20:56.340
Where are you?

21:02.140 --> 21:03.060
Natalie.

21:07.580 --> 21:08.540
Natalie?

21:10.340 --> 21:11.300
Natalie!

21:19.180 --> 21:20.180
Brian!

21:20.220 --> 21:22.420
- Where is she?
- Hey, hi, hi.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.780
- Brian.
- Quiet.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.500
I saw her. She got taken that way.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.020
- Taken?
- Yes.

21:36.860 --> 21:37.780
Let's go!

22:37.780 --> 22:38.740
Okay.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.020
Brian.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.300
Oh, my God!

23:40.380 --> 23:41.820
- Scott! Scott!
- Chris, are you...

23:42.140 --> 23:43.380
What happened? Are you okay?

23:43.420 --> 23:44.900
There is someone in the corn.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.260
- What?
- There is somebody out there.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.980
- They're after us. We gotta go.
- Chris.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.420
Brian.

25:17.540 --> 25:20.540
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Brian!
Brian. Are you okay?

25:21.780 --> 25:23.540
- My God, what happened to your arm?
- They got her.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.780
Who? Who got her?

26:28.140 --> 26:29.140
Shit.

27:02.100 --> 27:03.020
Fuck!

27:05.380 --> 27:07.460
We're surrounded.
We're fucking surrounded.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.620
- What?
- The fucking corn.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.260
It's everywhere.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.300
Johnny's gone.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.140
Wait, what? What you mean?
You found him?

27:15.420 --> 27:17.580
Yeah, he was upstairs in the sewing room.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.700
What the fuck was he doing in there?

27:20.580 --> 27:21.780
Sewing.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.180
Here.

27:24.620 --> 27:26.140
Look, guys, I don't think we're safe here.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.180
Yeah, no shit.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.740
No, I mean here, in here, we're not safe.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.020
Well, we're safer in here than out there.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.260
How do you know that?

27:32.340 --> 27:33.700
Look, we gotta find a way back to the road.

27:34.340 --> 27:36.780
Hey, what do you not understand
about "surrounded"?

27:36.860 --> 27:38.940
We're not going back out there.
It's not happening.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.100
Well, we have to find a way.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.620
They slaughtered Natalie.

27:43.140 --> 27:44.660
They ripped her a-fucking-part, man.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.300
Look at his arm.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.820
Multiply that times your whole body.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.060
What are your fucking odds
of getting out of here now?

27:51.900 --> 27:53.620
You sure came out fine.

27:57.660 --> 27:59.380
You saw her.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.940
And you didn't do a goddamn thing.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.140
Brian.

28:11.140 --> 28:14.260
Hey, Brian. Come on, man.
I saw the same fucking shit you did.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.420
Give me the flashlight.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.900
What are you doing?

28:25.300 --> 28:27.380
- You coming?
- Out there? No fucking way.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.060
I was talking to him.

28:38.580 --> 28:39.780
Keep an eye out.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.220
Yell if you see anything.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.740
Hey, Brian. Look, where are we going?

28:57.620 --> 28:58.700
Did you see...

30:03.820 --> 30:04.780
Fuck!

30:18.820 --> 30:20.380
Check for keys.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.260
No luck.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.460
Are you okay?

30:51.180 --> 30:52.260
It's bleeding less.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.300
That's not what I meant.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.500
I'm sorry about Natalie.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.180
This one looks drivable.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.540
We need to find the keys.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.580
See anything?

31:55.420 --> 31:56.340
Brian?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.140
Hey, hey.

32:45.820 --> 32:46.740
What happened?

32:47.180 --> 32:48.620
You didn't see that?

32:50.380 --> 32:51.340
See what?

33:01.300 --> 33:03.180
Now, you remember what I taught you.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.780
First, belly.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.380
Then the thighs, then the back.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.820
Come on.

33:13.900 --> 33:14.860
Come on, Alex.

33:15.580 --> 33:16.540
Good.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.740
Go on, bleed him dry. Good.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.620
Come on, boy.

33:27.460 --> 33:28.900
I'm proud of you, son.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.340
What the hell do you think you're doing?

33:52.900 --> 33:53.940
You do it.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.100
Go on.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.180
Scott, Scott. Hey!

34:14.980 --> 34:16.740
What is going on with you?

36:34.620 --> 36:35.540
Brian.

36:48.940 --> 36:49.900
Scott.

37:19.700 --> 37:20.660
Natalie.

37:44.700 --> 37:45.620
Chris.

37:46.460 --> 37:47.420
Chris.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.060
- Chris.
- Scott.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.020
- Chris, are you okay?
- Scott.

38:19.260 --> 38:21.140
- Chris!
- Get me the fuck out of here.

38:21.180 --> 38:22.580
I'm trying.

38:23.060 --> 38:24.940
Open the fucking door, man.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.100
It's locked on your side.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.260
Come on, man, you gotta...

38:29.380 --> 38:30.340
She's in here.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.900
- What?
- Whatever you do, knock it down, anything.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.340
Move.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.140
Natalie.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.420
Natalie.

39:09.620 --> 39:11.020
Brian, where are you going?

39:11.100 --> 39:12.060
What's happening?

39:12.140 --> 39:14.340
- He's gone.
- Gone? No!

39:14.420 --> 39:15.580
This isn't working.

39:15.660 --> 39:18.300
We gotta find another way.
There's a roof ledge, right?

39:21.380 --> 39:22.980
No way, man. No.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.460
You have no other choice.

39:24.540 --> 39:25.980
I'll meet you outside.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.820
Easy, easy. Watch your step.

40:30.020 --> 40:30.980
Shit!

40:40.180 --> 40:41.660
Oh, my God! Chris.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.340
Chris, are you okay?

40:43.420 --> 40:44.820
Oh, my God.

40:44.900 --> 40:45.860
Oh, God!

40:51.100 --> 40:52.700
Brian, Brian, Chris just...

40:55.140 --> 40:56.100
Brian.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.140
Where are you going? Brian!

41:28.260 --> 41:29.540
Easy, easy.

41:36.780 --> 41:37.740
Where is she?

41:39.460 --> 41:40.420
What?

41:42.580 --> 41:44.220
Where is she?

41:44.300 --> 41:46.380
I wouldn't know, man.
I fell through the fucking roof.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.540
How did she look?

41:47.620 --> 41:48.580
Dead!

41:52.380 --> 41:53.780
Well, she's...

41:53.860 --> 41:55.380
She's moving, and I gotta find her.

41:55.460 --> 41:56.580
Your girlfriend's fucking dead.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.860
So it's about time we start focusing
on getting us the hell out of here.

42:00.220 --> 42:01.780
Look, we found a truck.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.540
It looks drivable, right?

42:05.380 --> 42:07.340
I mean, we just gotta find a way to start it.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.820
Wait, is it a Chevy?

42:09.220 --> 42:10.580
Yeah, it was. Why?

42:13.980 --> 42:14.900
That's why.

42:16.420 --> 42:18.900
All we gotta do is just drive through
and get the hell out of here.

42:18.940 --> 42:20.180
We can't leave yet.

42:21.340 --> 42:22.580
Wait, what?

42:23.540 --> 42:25.620
- Are you serious?
- I'm not leaving without her.

42:25.700 --> 42:26.660
You gotta be kidding me.

42:26.740 --> 42:28.580
I brought us here.

42:28.660 --> 42:30.900
And I'm gonna get us out of here, all of us.

42:31.420 --> 42:32.740
We are all of us.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.260
Give me the keys.

42:36.540 --> 42:37.660
Hey, Brian, just hold on a second.

42:37.740 --> 42:40.140
I wouldn't leave you. Now give me the keys.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.220
- Brian, she's dead.
- Shut up!

42:50.300 --> 42:51.940
Is this how it's gonna be?
Your way or the highway?

42:52.020 --> 42:53.100
Give me the keys.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.140
Not your best.

44:30.940 --> 44:31.860
Not your worst.

44:35.220 --> 44:36.300
Stop!

45:18.940 --> 45:19.900
Help!

45:20.540 --> 45:21.500
Brian!

45:23.900 --> 45:24.900
Brian!

45:24.980 --> 45:26.740
Somebody, Chris, help me!

45:30.140 --> 45:31.460
Help me!

45:48.220 --> 45:50.420
Oh, God! Oh, God!

46:04.820 --> 46:05.820
Oh, God, no.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.780
Stop!

46:56.780 --> 46:57.740
Can you move?

47:12.580 --> 47:14.580
What the fuck were you thinking?

47:17.980 --> 47:19.420
Shit!

47:19.500 --> 47:20.980
Get something from inside.

47:21.580 --> 47:22.900
Brian, your arm, man.

47:22.940 --> 47:25.140
- Help him. He's worse.
- Here, you take that.

47:27.980 --> 47:28.940
What is wrong with you?

47:32.540 --> 47:33.780
I've been seeing things.

47:35.580 --> 47:37.220
Back in the barn, there was this farmer.

47:38.140 --> 47:39.860
And then I saw this kid.

47:40.340 --> 47:42.060
This teenager.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.740
He ran into the corn.

47:44.420 --> 47:45.460
I followed him.

47:47.780 --> 47:49.300
I've been going crazy.

47:53.860 --> 47:56.860
Guys, Natalie saw someone by the road.

47:59.740 --> 48:01.300
And I saw him too.

48:01.340 --> 48:02.860
- Where?
- I don't know.

48:02.940 --> 48:03.980
It was...

48:04.060 --> 48:05.460
It was in the kitchen by the cellar.

48:05.540 --> 48:06.500
Finish this.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.020
Brian, you can't just...

48:10.100 --> 48:11.020
What are you doing?

48:12.980 --> 48:13.900
He's losing it.

48:20.700 --> 48:21.780
Just go help him, okay?

48:21.860 --> 48:22.820
No, no, no.

48:26.860 --> 48:27.820
Look.

48:28.540 --> 48:30.580
Natalie was a nice girl and I liked her.

48:32.060 --> 48:33.980
What happened to her is horrible.

48:34.780 --> 48:36.020
But she's dead.

48:37.740 --> 48:40.460
And I'm not gonna let the fact
that Brian can't handle that get us killed.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.860
He's as gone as she is.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.220
Now, I can get us out of here.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.100
But I need you to make a choice.

48:55.420 --> 48:56.780
You stay here with him.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.740
Or you come with me.

49:12.860 --> 49:14.780
If you're not gonna help him,

49:14.860 --> 49:16.260
then I will.

49:35.460 --> 49:36.860
Hey, Brian, wait.

49:38.980 --> 49:39.940
What?

49:40.940 --> 49:43.540
I think, no matter what,
I'm safer sticking with you.

50:17.660 --> 50:18.660
What are these?

50:39.580 --> 50:42.220
Won't let me leave! He won't let me leave!

50:45.340 --> 50:47.780
Stop, stop. It's me.

50:49.700 --> 50:51.180
Is it the farm boy again?

50:54.540 --> 50:55.820
That's him.

51:29.540 --> 51:31.500
I don't know who Chris saw.

51:32.340 --> 51:33.420
This isn't the guy.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.260
He said, "He won't let me leave."

51:40.460 --> 51:42.940
Well, looks like he found a way.

52:07.900 --> 52:08.860
Is that...

52:17.900 --> 52:18.860
Chris!

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
Come on!

53:14.740 --> 53:17.260
Come on! Shit!

53:30.300 --> 53:31.380
Come on.

54:23.580 --> 54:24.900
What the fuck?

55:21.020 --> 55:21.980
Johnny!

55:35.700 --> 55:37.020
We need to move, now.

55:44.380 --> 55:46.100
Run, I'll cover you.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.860
- We can run... The road...
- We're not leaving Scott. Go!

55:59.020 --> 56:00.340
Come on, you son of a bitch.

56:13.100 --> 56:14.060
Natalie?

56:21.500 --> 56:22.460
Baby?

56:29.260 --> 56:30.300
Say something.

56:35.380 --> 56:36.500
Please.

56:56.860 --> 56:57.780
Natalie.

58:23.180 --> 58:24.140
Corey.

58:26.300 --> 58:27.380
Where's your brother?

58:34.060 --> 58:35.220
You about done with your work?

1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:01.420
Are you okay?

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.180
Where's Brian?

1:00:03.260 --> 1:00:04.700
Where's Brian?

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:07.180
No.

1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:09.980
No, no, no, no.

1:00:39.300 --> 1:00:40.380
I've been thinking.

1:00:40.460 --> 1:00:43.220
We know we're safer in here
because they can't leave the field.

1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:45.020
And we know that every time
someone steps foot in that field,

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:46.180
they get attacked, right?

1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:49.660
Well, then how did Brian and I
get through the first time?

1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:50.820
What does it matter?

1:00:51.380 --> 1:00:52.420
Are you kidding?

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:55.220
I was literally inches away from
one of those things, it didn't even move.

1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:58.140
See, I think it was Johnny.

1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:00.220
He was in the room upstairs.
I saw the light on in the window.

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:01.580
So?

1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:03.900
So...

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:07.940
Here, think of it this way.
This right here is us.

1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:09.300
All right?

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:13.660
And these are them, here in the cornfield.

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:17.260
Johnny entered the cornfield

1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:18.940
and got attacked.

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:22.260
But then Brian and I entered
and nothing happened, why?

1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:27.540
Because whatever attacked Johnny
was busy with him,

1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:29.460
turning him into one of the scarecrows.

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.820
In chess, it's called a promotion,
taking a turn to upgrade your pawn.

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.660
So while Johnny was upstairs
getting promoted,

1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:40.100
Brian and I were able
to walk through the field safely.

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:43.300
Yeah, but when Johnny is upstairs,
what about all of them?

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:44.300
Why didn't they do anything?

1:01:44.860 --> 1:01:46.660
Well, because...

1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:49.460
Because it's not them.

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:54.380
This kid killed his brother and hid him
in the cornfield as a scarecrow.

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:57.980
And now the brother,
I mean his spirit, it's trapped out there.

1:01:58.060 --> 1:01:59.860
And it waits
for someone to come into the field

1:01:59.900 --> 1:02:02.100
and it jumps from scarecrow to scarecrow,

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:03.740
killing whoever enters.

1:02:04.660 --> 1:02:06.540
But the spirit can only inhabit
one scarecrow at a time.

1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:07.980
They can't all come at us together.

1:02:09.260 --> 1:02:12.140
And so after it kills someone,
it takes them upstairs,

1:02:12.220 --> 1:02:13.580
turning them into another scarecrow,

1:02:15.100 --> 1:02:16.660
to use against the next.

1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:21.260
So what you're saying
is we missed our shot.

1:02:22.460 --> 1:02:26.580
No. No, what I'm saying is that
when it's busy with someone upstairs,

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:30.060
it's our move.

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:07.340
This can never happen to anyone,
ever again.

1:03:09.980 --> 1:03:10.940
What do we do?

1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:23.300
Brian.

1:04:26.620 --> 1:04:28.020
If you're in there, man,

1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:33.900
please,

1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:36.420
just let me...

1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:04.660
Hey, I got what I could.

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:06.020
Trade you.

1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:12.940
- Can you keep up?
- I can die trying.

1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:29.780
Come on, we're almost there.

1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:38.940
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm looking for the shotgun.

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.980
- That won't stop them.
- It'll slow them down.

1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:42.020
Help me find it.

1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:52.460
Son of a bitch!

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:12.900
No!

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:23.500
Found it. Let's go.

1:07:46.220 --> 1:07:47.260
Let's go!

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:56.940
Scott, are you okay?

1:07:57.620 --> 1:07:59.020
I don't think I can make it.

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:01.620
We gotta keep moving.

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:10.660
Why did they stop coming?

1:08:12.060 --> 1:08:13.020
They didn't.

1:08:17.700 --> 1:08:19.180
Can you keep going?

1:08:19.260 --> 1:08:20.180
It's no use.

1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:23.660
We have to split up.

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:25.500
We're far enough along.
It should be just one.

1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:30.220
It won't be able to move
against the both of us.

1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:31.420
Yeah.

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:36.180
You go that way.

1:08:36.220 --> 1:08:37.780
I'll go this way.

1:08:37.860 --> 1:08:39.340
- All right?
- Okay.

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:40.660
Hey, Scott!

1:08:42.580 --> 1:08:43.500
I'll see you at the road.

1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:46.420
Yeah, okay.

1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:13.940
Sorry, Brian.

1:13:23.460 --> 1:13:24.420
Run!

1:13:25.300 --> 1:13:27.380
Run, run!

1:13:29.340 --> 1:13:30.700
Run!

1:13:32.860 --> 1:13:33.780
Run!

1:13:34.460 --> 1:13:35.500
Run!

1:14:59.540 --> 1:15:00.940
Hello, anybody there?
