01:00.018 --> 01:05.024
Kryptonite, the ultimate bane to Superman.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.535
If it were only as big as my head.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.328
I spent two years and $3 billion
mining outer space...

01:13.490 --> 01:17.870
...and this green grain of rice is
all I have to show for it?

01:19.162 --> 01:20.835
Eh, it's a pretty green.

01:20.998 --> 01:26.846
Unless I have enough of it to make
Superman's head explode, Mercy, my dear...

01:27.004 --> 01:29.883
...it's not the kind of green that interests me.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.928
LexCorp bleeds millions every time
the Man of Steel...

01:34.094 --> 01:37.724
...thwarts my covert plans to
achieve world domination.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.608
What does he have against
free enterprise, anyway, hmm?

01:40.767 --> 01:44.772
And every day that Superman's
popularity spikes...

01:44.938 --> 01:48.693
...mine drops another rung
down the sewers of Metropolis.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.362
Well, I think you're amazing, Mr. Luthor.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.781
I pay you to think I'm amazing, Mercy.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.075
But market research shows it doesn't matter...

01:56.241 --> 01:59.211
...how much money Lex Luthor
pumps into this economy.

01:59.536 --> 02:03.416
People only respond to amazing heroes. Huh.

02:03.582 --> 02:08.633
So today LexCorp unveils a new breed of hero.

02:08.794 --> 02:14.552
Up, up and away above Metropolis,
to defend our city, our world...

02:14.718 --> 02:18.598
<i>...against wayward meteors and alien threats.</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:24.228
<i>Because even Superman
can't patrol Earth's orbit 24/7.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:39.835
The LX7 supercomputer indicates
the bogey may be space debris.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.418
Uh, that debris just hung a hard right toward Earth.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.553
Uh, let's put Lex 9000 to the test.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.863
Velocity is off the charts. Impact in...

03:09.022 --> 03:10.945
I know the when, just give me the where.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.157
Uh, here. It's heading straight for us.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.403
Let's get out of here.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.755
Data. Billions of bit streams.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.090
I think I shall help myself.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.363
Brainiac just hijacked Lexlabs.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.652
If he's gonna cripple Metropolis
by crashing all our computers like last time...

04:36.818 --> 04:40.163
...whose front page am I gonna read it on first?

04:40.822 --> 04:44.247
I'm on it, chief. Just need to make a pit stop.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.173
Uh, but my hands are still Wet, Ms. Lane.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.680
Dry them on your socks
and grab your camera, Jimmy.

04:56.838 --> 05:01.389
If Kent beats us to another scoop,
I've officially lost my mojo.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.277
Buckle up.

05:18.527 --> 05:23.624
Mr. Luthor, sir.
Brainiac just crash-landed at Lexlabs.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.503
But Lex 9000...

05:27.661 --> 05:30.164
Shall I fetch the limo?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.623
Brainiac.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.969
It's time to log off.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.429
But I hunger for knowledge, son of Krypton.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.061
And knowledge is power.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.900
You may want to attend to that.

06:48.742 --> 06:53.213
Whoa. He's going the other way, Ms. Lane.
What are we gonna do?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.967
Get another angle on things.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.769
Why can't you be more like Kent?

07:11.932 --> 07:15.402
He never whines.
Heck, half the time, I don't even know he's here.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.827
You better get the fear.
Be a real newsman, or there's the door.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.165
Huh.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.226
Oh, Ms. Lane, you know something
bad's gonna happen.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.019
Why do you always have to
put yourself in these situations?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.485
He's why, Jimmy.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.576
Upload complete.

08:09.739 --> 08:14.290
Another small step in my evolution
toward becoming the ultimate intellect.

08:14.452 --> 08:19.879
And information is most valuable
if I am the only one who possesses it.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.220
Were the only one.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.188
Nice try, son of Krypton...

08:36.515 --> 08:40.191
...but I am now equipped to go one better.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.741
It may not be kryptonite...

08:57.162 --> 08:59.335
...but its power cannot be denied.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.744
I am so happy...

09:35.992 --> 09:37.039
No, wait.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.537
- I'm sad.
- Sir?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.924
Lex 9000 is supposed to bust up meteors,
not Superman.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.088
News of this could ruin me.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.804
Well, can't beat ringside.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.219
Mercy, microwave some popcorn.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.718
Oh, boy.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.947
Ms. Lane!

12:41.719 --> 12:44.017
Help! Help!

12:55.149 --> 12:58.244
How ironic. Brought to your knees by a device...

12:58.403 --> 13:00.952
...intended to drive the likes of me away.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.583
With you deleted, son of Krypton...

13:03.741 --> 13:07.336
...nothing can stop me from draining
your planet dry of all its data.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.338
<i>Help! Help!</i>

13:09.497 --> 13:14.970
I think I shall enjoy hurtling humankind
back to the Dark Ages.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.350
Ooh. Brain freeze.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.429
Ms. Lane, you really need to be more careful.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.429
You always catch me when I fall, Superman.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.817
Besides, how else am I supposed to
get to know you better?

14:12.268 --> 14:15.147
Brainiac and Lex 9000 made quite a team.

14:15.313 --> 14:19.159
They were yay close to offing
the big blue boy scout.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.070
Until Superman brained Brainiac.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.921
Or did he?

14:37.919 --> 14:41.014
Please, please, shoot my good side.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.140
Didn't know you had one.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.926
TouchÃ©, Lane.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.352
Welcome, Superman.

14:53.851 --> 14:58.322
I'd offer you a latte, but Brainiac seems to
have busted up our refreshment station.

14:58.481 --> 15:02.531
Mr. Luthor, care to comment about
the operation of your so-called meteor buster?

15:02.693 --> 15:05.788
Hey, hey, hey, I just build the stuff.

15:05.947 --> 15:11.044
How intergalactic scum choose to use it is
another matter. Isn't that right, Superman?

15:11.202 --> 15:14.923
If it had done its job
and shot down Brainiac in the first place...

15:15.081 --> 15:17.175
...we wouldn't be having this conversation.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.710
Oh, pshaw.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.675
New technology always requires fine-tuning.

15:23.714 --> 15:28.470
But the real question is,
who's gonna pay for this mess?

15:28.636 --> 15:32.311
Thanks to you, Superman,
Brainiac's in no condition to cut me a check.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.857
Nope, no signs of life here.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.204
Kent, you're one heck of a journalist,
maybe my best.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.581
You meet deadlines without breaking a sweat...

15:48.739 --> 15:52.039
...and without putting yourself
in harm's way like Lane.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.495
I'm not sure how you pull it off.

15:54.662 --> 15:59.259
Well, guess I just keep my eye on the story
and my fingers on the typewriter keys.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.422
Kent, I wish you'd reconsider my offer
to be our foreign correspondent.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.592
Branch out. It's the <i>Daily Planet</i>, after all.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.475
Oh, I don't know, Mr. White.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.104
I'd hate being so far away
from home base, from the gang.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.890
What are you, in kindergarten?

16:14.056 --> 16:18.778
I suggest you worry about being far from home
when you decide to settle down.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.330
Whoa.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.792
- Mercy.
- Nice collection you got there, Jimmy.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.169
Which do you recommend I use for my story?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.881
Um... This one's my favorite.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.714
Get over her, Jimmy. She'd eat you alive.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.345
Sarah's really more your speed.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.013
Sarah? That geek?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.514
We don't have anything in common.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.179
You both work for the newspaper.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.144
- She's the food critic.
- Free meals.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.149
You'd never have to pick up the check.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.606
I like cheeseburgers and chili fries.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.692
She likes chichi.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.406
It's her job to like chichi.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.614
You know what they say, Jimmy:
Beauty isn't skin-deep.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.866
Look who's talking,
Miss Only-Has-Eyes-for-Superman.

17:13.031 --> 17:16.957
I won't deny there's something about
a flying man in tights that gets me tingly...

17:19.079 --> 17:22.755
...but when you look into someone's eyes
and get that connected feeling...

17:22.916 --> 17:26.012
...like somehow you've always known them...

17:26.170 --> 17:28.764
...that's when you know it's right.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.469
So, Jimmy, get past the glasses, huh?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.978
Hey, uh, someone mention chili fries?

17:38.140 --> 17:41.189
Uh, yeah, about four hours ago.

17:41.352 --> 17:45.232
Well, you two have fun.
I have a Superman story to finish.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.863
Check out my snaps, Mr. K.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.698
Mercy may Work for the dark side...

17:49.860 --> 17:53.865
...but I think that just adds to her dangerous allure.

17:54.031 --> 17:58.457
I wouldn't know, Jimmy.
She's not exactly my type.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.480
Hello, anyone home?

18:26.063 --> 18:29.033
<i>What? Where am I?</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:32.320
Oh. I was hoping his first words would be "Dada."

18:32.737 --> 18:34.159
Where are you?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.953
And Lex Luthor gave him sight.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.751
- Lex Luthor?
- In the flesh.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.090
<i>I know of you through my...
...Acquisition of knowledge...</i>

18:49.253 --> 18:52.257
...through my patented Lexlabs
supercomputer, yada, yada, yada.

18:52.423 --> 18:57.771
<i>Your tone conveys a familiarity
that has not yet been earned, Lex Luthor.</i>

18:57.928 --> 19:00.556
You know, it's just that kind of braggadocio...

19:00.723 --> 19:03.067
...that got you brained to bits in the first place.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.946
By the son of Krypton, yes.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.816
I'm feeling the love here. Are you?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.952
Brainy, babe, you and I are both muy simpatico.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.363
We're both into the world-domination thing...

19:15.529 --> 19:19.955
...and we both despise
the superpowered boy scout of Metropolis.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.461
<i>If you have a point, make it.</i>

19:22.620 --> 19:25.794
I can provide you with the ultimate opportunity...

19:25.956 --> 19:30.132
- ...to annihilate Superman.
- <i>And in return?</i>

19:30.294 --> 19:34.299
You allow me to publicly avenge the Man of Steel.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.475
Put on a big show, playing hero,
chase you from Earth.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.561
Then you take over some other world far away...

19:42.723 --> 19:45.442
...and leave the domination of this one to me.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.777
- We both live happily ever after.
- The end.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.236
<i>We make strange allies, Lex Luthor.</i>

19:54.402 --> 19:59.033
<i>But giving up Earth is small sacrifice
for ridding the galaxies of my mortal enemy.</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:01.997
Let's rebuild you, partner.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.628
<i>I am a biotechnic entity.</i>

20:04.787 --> 20:08.007
<i>All that I require is proximity to technology...</i>

20:08.165 --> 20:10.418
<i>...to incorporate into my very being.</i>

20:10.584 --> 20:15.010
Hey, I didn't mean to step on any proverbial toes.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.890
But if that's the case...

20:17.049 --> 20:18.892
...I suggest that we incorporate you...

20:19.051 --> 20:21.554
...with something other than
a toaster oven this time.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.849
Something with a little more...

20:24.014 --> 20:25.891
...muscle.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.073
Clark, is something troubling you?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.734
You hardly touched your chicken and dumplings.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.198
Yeah, you usually have at least six helpings.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.238
I'm watching my carbs, Morn.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.079
Well, we're sure glad you flew home
for the weekend, son.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.744
Since you've been in Metropolis, we barely see you.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.878
Figured it was work keeping you busy.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.380
Or a lady. Unh.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.884
- Any thoughts about settling clown?
- On Earth?

20:52.042 --> 20:53.089
Oh, I'm here to stay.

20:58.174 --> 21:02.429
Lois has been on my mind. Again.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.856
Oh. How are things, you know, going with her?

21:06.015 --> 21:08.143
As Superman? Dandy.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.607
But she can't seem to look Clark Kent in the eye.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.693
Well, maybe it's the spectacles.

21:12.855 --> 21:15.654
Ever consider getting
that new-fangled laser surgery?

21:15.816 --> 21:18.160
Heh. He doesn't need glasses.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.993
Right, right, x-ray vision. I knew that.

21:21.155 --> 21:24.750
Look, Lois is a crack reporter. Best there is.

21:24.909 --> 21:28.038
It's only a matter of time
before she gets past the glasses...

21:28.204 --> 21:30.627
...sees through my disguise.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.259
I'm concerned she won't ever trust me...

21:33.417 --> 21:35.761
...or Superman again.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.885
I need to tell Lois the truth.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.096
So, what's keeping you, Clark?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.511
- You got our support.
- Mm.

21:45.888 --> 21:50.439
I have powerful enemies who would give
anything to find my Weak spot.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.730
If any one of them were to discover
what Lois might learn...

21:53.896 --> 21:56.115
...that Clark Kent is Superman...

21:56.273 --> 21:59.698
Well, I can't knowingly put Lois...

21:59.860 --> 22:03.455
...put anyone I care about, in that kind of danger.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.835
Son, we know you're Superman, and we're just fine.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.916
Clark, if there's one thing we've learned
since being blessed with you...

22:13.082 --> 22:17.462
...a risk is worth taking if it's for love.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.316
Since you've already hijacked
Lex 9000 once on your own...

22:34.478 --> 22:36.355
...I have an automatic alibi.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.524
You just build the stuff. Heh.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.068
<i>Enough dallying.</i>

22:40.234 --> 22:43.864
<i>My biotechnic-grafting process
requires an incubation period.</i>

22:44.029 --> 22:45.872
Hold your horses, Brainy.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.331
We have a couple of extras for your travel kit. One:

22:49.493 --> 22:50.995
<i>Kryptonite.</i>

22:51.161 --> 22:54.165
A smidgen, but who knows?

22:54.331 --> 22:56.254
Combined with your new firepower...

22:56.417 --> 23:00.138
...it might be just enough to kick things up a notch.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.548
<i>And second?</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:04.342
We took a swab off your shiny little dome...

23:04.508 --> 23:06.181
...and guess what turned up.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.390
Your IQ.

23:15.603 --> 23:19.107
Seems Super-Duperman clocked you so hard...

23:19.273 --> 23:22.072
...he left a little something
for you to remember him by.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.738
A strand of DNA.

23:25.905 --> 23:30.285
<i>With the Kryptonian's DNA,
I can lock on to his energy signature...</i>

23:30.451 --> 23:32.920
<i>...track him wherever he may be.</i>

23:33.078 --> 23:36.582
That's right, partner. Heh.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.878
Superman may run faster than a speeding bullet...

23:40.044 --> 23:42.843
...but he can't hide.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.986
See you at Superman's funeral.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.701
- Night.
- Hasta la vista.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.988
See you in the a.m.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.949
Not so fast.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.163
Kent, need you to cover for Sarah tonight.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.577
She just called in sick.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.042
Lovesick. Ha, ha.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.047
No, ate some bad clams.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.834
You'll be reviewing Lamont Laboe's new hot spot.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.922
Ooh. TrÃ¨s chichi.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.636
But, Perry,
I don't know the first thing about how to...

25:49.798 --> 25:53.723
Lane, the reservation's for two. Help the man out.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.980
Hungry?

26:29.046 --> 26:32.892
Once again, I am reborn.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.741
- I didn't know it was gonna be so...
- Dark?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.411
Welcome to Le Chateau Laboe...

26:56.573 --> 26:59.167
...the most romantic
dining experience in Metropolis.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.829
Are we celebrating an anniversary tonight?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.960
Honeymooning?

27:04.915 --> 27:06.508
Ah, dating.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.547
- Um, heh, actually, we're, uh...
- Critics.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.682
So let's keep things professional, huh?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.888
Mm.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.275
I love to dine surrounded by beauty.

27:23.725 --> 27:28.322
After I make a show of mopping up Brainiac
with one of my patented Lexosuits...

27:28.480 --> 27:31.609
...I'll be the new boy scout of Metropolis.

27:31.775 --> 27:35.530
And the military will finally beg
to pay you top dollar for them.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.495
Hmm. You're learning, Mercy.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.876
Now, parmesan, por favor.

27:41.034 --> 27:45.505
Sir, mission control
has lost all contact with Lex 9000.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.587
It vanished.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.052
It's showtime.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.090
Well, no, no, I'm sure...

27:58.886 --> 28:02.481
- Ew.
- Calamari not your thing, Smallville?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.810
Ha, ha. I'm 100 percent corn-fed.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.944
If it's not Mom's chicken and dumplings...

28:08.103 --> 28:10.105
Well, I'm glad there's squid on the table.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.650
My pen just ran out of ink.

28:16.153 --> 28:19.874
You know, Lois, I never pegged you
for such a romantic.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.333
I mean, with Jimmy. Playing matchmaker and all.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.793
I just hate seeing people miss opportunities.

28:27.956 --> 28:31.005
Life's too short, you know What I mean?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.678
I think I'm starting to.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.010
So I meddle in Olsen's affairs.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.302
What's your story, Kent? Seeing anyone?

28:40.344 --> 28:45.521
I'm waiting for a special someone
to take notice of me.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.107
Kent, Why so mild-mannered?

28:49.269 --> 28:52.364
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell a girl What's on your mind.

28:52.522 --> 28:56.652
I mean, you're kind, intelligent...

28:56.818 --> 29:00.322
...good-looking, well built...

29:08.372 --> 29:09.624
What is it, Lois?

29:09.790 --> 29:11.087
For a moment, you...

29:13.168 --> 29:15.637
...reminded me of someone I know, that's all.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.534
Lois, this is hard for me.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.163
Maybe harder than anything I've ever had to say.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.245
But there's something I need to tell you.

29:44.408 --> 29:47.082
Son of Krypton.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.372
Yes, Clark?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.132
You have something right here.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.335
Oh.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.846
- Son of Krypton.
- I'm here, Brainiac.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.975
Clark? Clark?

30:20.694 --> 30:24.574
I have been keeping pace
with current trends in technology.

30:24.740 --> 30:28.085
And I have upgraded with one goal in mind:

30:28.618 --> 30:29.870
your destruction.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.963
Chief, trust me.
This is one restaurant review...

31:18.126 --> 31:20.970
...you'll want plastered on the front page.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.722
All I need is my ace photographer.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.978
Hey, wait a sec.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.138
Technology.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.483
Enemy engaged.

31:55.997 --> 32:00.173
You cannot hide from me, son of Krypton.

32:04.381 --> 32:09.308
The more I try to resist him, the weaker I become.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.935
This time, son of Krypton, I possess brawn as well as brain.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.008
Huh?

32:49.092 --> 32:51.265
Oh, no.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.508
Ms. Lane.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.473
Lois. Lois.

33:29.466 --> 33:32.470
Superman, I...

33:32.928 --> 33:34.350
...should be more careful.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.120
We're doing everything we can
to keep her comfortable.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.415
She can be comfortable at home, doc.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.003
What's her condition?

34:44.456 --> 34:46.255
We're still running tests, but...

34:46.418 --> 34:48.420
...her blood cells seem to be fusing...

34:48.587 --> 34:50.965
...with traces of metal alloy.

34:51.130 --> 34:55.101
As if she's being galvanized from the inside out.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.888
We've called in specialists, but...

34:58.054 --> 35:01.809
...if Ms. Lane's blood
continues to mutate at this rate...

35:01.975 --> 35:03.397
...she hasn't much time.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.268
Superman.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.354
He didn't save her this time, Mr. Kent.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.390
Superman didn't save her.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.067
I need to go away for a while, Jimmy.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.446
But I promise you...

35:49.606 --> 35:53.611
...Superman will do everything
in his power to save Lois.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.618
Was quite a slugfest
at the new fondue joint last night.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.786
But I'm not sure which I find more tragic:

36:02.952 --> 36:05.796
Superman's corpse
failing to turn up in the rubble...

36:05.955 --> 36:08.253
...or Lane's little mishap.

36:08.416 --> 36:12.137
Maybe she'll think twice next time
she decides to snoop in your business.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.844
If there's a next time.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.759
Hmm. Mercy, send flowers.

36:17.926 --> 36:20.179
We could use the PR.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.767
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

37:08.435 --> 37:12.190
Lois has been harmed, and it's my fault.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.699
Brainiac knew I was at the restaurant.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.281
Which means he's either discovered my identity...

37:17.444 --> 37:19.446
...or a Way of tracking me.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.874
<i>Then I must question the wisdom
in your coming here, Kal-El.</i>

37:23.032 --> 37:26.036
<i>All of Krypton's secrets could be compromised.</i>

37:26.202 --> 37:28.375
I need to save Lois.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.006
Nothing else matters.

37:30.165 --> 37:33.715
And this is the one time neither my speed
nor my strength can help her.

37:33.877 --> 37:37.381
<i>My analysis of Ms. Lane's condition is complete.</i>

37:37.547 --> 37:42.144
<i>Most curiously, I have detected a faint trace
of kryptonite in her bloodstream.</i>

37:42.343 --> 37:44.437
That would explain my weakness.

37:44.596 --> 37:49.147
<i>Ms. Lane is suffering from a highly
concentrated form of blood-alloy fusion.</i>

37:49.309 --> 37:51.107
What will it take to cure her?

37:51.269 --> 37:53.988
<i>There is no earthly cure.</i>

37:54.147 --> 37:57.697
<i>- There does exist a rare substance.</i>
<i>- Where do I find it?</i>

37:58.902 --> 38:02.907
<i>Only one place. The Phantom Zone.</i>

38:21.508 --> 38:22.976
I must go there.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.641
<i>I had expected that, Kal-El.</i>

38:25.804 --> 38:27.602
<i>But listen carefully.</i>

38:28.056 --> 38:29.729
<i>Though the Phantom Zone is prison...</i>

38:29.891 --> 38:32.770
<i>...to the most dangerous criminals
in all the galaxies...</i>

38:32.936 --> 38:36.236
<i>...they will not present
the greatest threat to you within it.</i>

38:36.606 --> 38:39.359
I'm prepared to fend off any of its attacks.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.279
<i>Once inside, remain intently focused...</i>

38:42.445 --> 38:45.449
<i>...and above all, accomplish your mission swiftly.</i>

38:45.615 --> 38:47.743
<i>For the longer you remain in the Zone...</i>

38:47.909 --> 38:50.628
<i>...the more vulnerable you will be to its effects...</i>

38:50.787 --> 38:54.417
<i>...and the more difficult it will become
for you to find your way back.</i>

38:54.582 --> 38:59.258
<i>The substance which you seek
lies at the heart of the Phantom Zone.</i>

38:59.420 --> 39:01.263
<i>Argonium 44.</i>

39:01.422 --> 39:03.595
<i>Be sure to obtain enough of it.</i>

39:03.758 --> 39:05.681
<i>As well as cure Ms. Lane...</i>

39:05.844 --> 39:09.223
<i>...Argonium 44 may also serve to shield you...</i>

39:09.389 --> 39:12.893
<i>from Brainiac's form of modified kryptonite.</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:20.150
You cannot hide from me.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.007
So this is your sanctuary.

39:54.183 --> 39:57.357
Data. Kryptonian data.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.365
The mother lode.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.659
Billions of bits...

40:03.818 --> 40:07.368
...from the great minds of the extinct planet Krypton.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.749
I shall drain it dry.

40:13.202 --> 40:16.877
The computer only responds to my DNA.

40:19.125 --> 40:23.130
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

40:23.296 --> 40:25.390
Yes, it does.

40:25.548 --> 40:30.224
This ends here, with us.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.143
DNA recognition override.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.604
<i>Self-destruct mode commenced.</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:37.610
<i>Twelve. 11...</i>

40:37.894 --> 40:43.492
No, you would not.
All the knowledge of your civilization, lost?

40:43.650 --> 40:46.324
Better lost than abused.

40:46.486 --> 40:51.162
- ...four, three, two, one.
- No!

41:08.800 --> 41:10.768
No energy signature.

41:10.927 --> 41:16.024
At least the son of Krypton is no more.

41:41.874 --> 41:45.799
I got one heck of a case of food poisoning.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.011
Last time I eat outwith Clark.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.801
Where is Clark?

42:37.221 --> 42:40.191
Mercy, it's beginning to feel
like somewhere in the world...

42:40.349 --> 42:42.943
...Superman may be history.

42:45.021 --> 42:49.071
Break out the tiki torches. We're throwing a luau.

42:50.068 --> 42:54.369
And be sure to invite
all our favorite members of the press.

42:56.949 --> 43:01.204
So here I work on Kent for a year
to be my foreign correspondent...

43:01.370 --> 43:03.464
...and he picks now to take the job.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.216
Then I don't hear boo from him...

43:05.374 --> 43:07.923
...and for the first time ever, he misses a deadline.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.180
Oh. Still can't reach him.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.558
Maybe his cell can't roam in Uzbekistan.

43:13.716 --> 43:18.722
I can't figure Why Kent isn't here,
with Lane laid up the way she is.

43:18.888 --> 43:21.437
Not to mention Superman.

43:22.141 --> 43:25.566
Olsen, you thinking what I'm thinking?

43:26.687 --> 43:30.282
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.910
Mr. Kent hasn't been too forthcoming.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.663
It's obvious now.

43:35.947 --> 43:39.497
Kent only took the foreign assignment
to get away from here.

43:39.659 --> 43:42.128
From the pain of seeing Lane this way.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.631
She must really mean a lot to him.

44:23.536 --> 44:27.837
Hang on just a little longer, Lois.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.985
What the...?

44:50.980 --> 44:52.823
Olsen, why are you still here?

44:52.982 --> 44:55.485
Because you told me not to hover
around the hospital.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.494
Gotta give the doctors room to work.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.073
Well, you gotta get your mind off this.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.082
Gotta do something with yourself.

45:02.241 --> 45:05.415
Okay, I'll go to the hospital.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.922
No. Look, kid.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.209
I really should have a reporter
at the Luthor shindig tonight.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.629
- You go.
- But I'm a photographer.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.547
Well, I'm short-staffed.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.968
My ace newshounds are either overseas...

45:20.301 --> 45:22.303
...or on their deathbeds.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.104
I'll report anything you want me to report,
Mr. White.

45:27.266 --> 45:31.146
It just won't be Ms. Lane's obit,
because she's gonna be all right.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.274
You know she's gonna be all right.

46:23.906 --> 46:27.956
- Clark?
- Yes.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.917
Yes, Lois.

46:31.205 --> 46:34.254
You mean, you...?

47:13.122 --> 47:15.500
Thank you all for coming.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.887
- You cut quite a rug, Senator Marquez.
- Ha, ha.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.515
Try the fiesta dip, Mrs. Mayor.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.926
It'll put hair on your back. Ha, ha.

47:28.387 --> 47:31.140
Is this thing on'? Ahem.

47:31.307 --> 47:34.186
Now, the new reports are true.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.108
LexCorp's had a run of rough luck recently.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.945
Heck, we can't even locate half our satellites.

47:42.777 --> 47:45.371
But I want to state for the public record...

47:45.529 --> 47:50.126
...that my company will never cease
in its mission to devote all its resources...

47:50.284 --> 47:54.005
...to the goodwill of Lexopolis...
Uh, Metropolis. Heh.

47:58.042 --> 47:59.635
Huh?

48:28.030 --> 48:29.748
<i>Do not resist, mortals.</i>

48:29.907 --> 48:32.535
<i>I now control all transmissions.</i>

48:32.701 --> 48:37.207
<i>Metropolis belongs to Brainiac.</i>

48:40.501 --> 48:42.879
And no sign of Superman.

48:43.045 --> 48:46.925
I guess it's time to try on a new suit.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.265
Downtown Metropolis has come under attack!

48:50.886 --> 48:53.935
Well, where is the Man of Steel
when you most need him?

48:54.515 --> 48:57.314
Allow me to put my money where my mouth is.

48:57.476 --> 49:01.231
Members of the press,
I suggest you grab your cameras...

49:01.397 --> 49:03.240
...and meet me downtown in five.

49:06.569 --> 49:10.244
Okay. Okay, Olsen, you're a reporter.

49:10.406 --> 49:13.080
So, what would Ms. Lane do?

49:13.242 --> 49:16.872
Get another angle on things.

49:20.791 --> 49:25.922
Well, our big-brained alien ally
couldn't have timed that better.

49:26.088 --> 49:30.889
Now Luthorman smacks him down
while the world watches.

49:32.511 --> 49:35.435
Get ready for your close-up, Mr. Luthor.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.693
Luther's working with Brainiac?

49:38.851 --> 49:41.229
What would Ms. Lane do'?

49:42.188 --> 49:44.611
Find proof.

49:53.949 --> 49:56.998
My mind is so blown.

49:57.161 --> 50:00.335
I'm alive, with you.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.926
Lois, take it easy. You're still weak.

50:04.084 --> 50:08.931
You always catch me when I fall, Clark Kent.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.342
It makes total sense.

50:11.509 --> 50:14.763
I'm such a fool for not seeing it.

50:14.929 --> 50:19.059
And for not ever imagining
I'd be pressing my lips to yours...

50:19.225 --> 50:21.398
...before Superman's.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.565
Heh. I'm, uh, not sure it's the right time, Lois.

50:25.731 --> 50:29.235
Gotcha. You're thinking romantic setting.

50:29.401 --> 50:32.450
Say, a candlelit table back at Le Chateau?

50:32.613 --> 50:36.538
Lois, now that I know you're safe,
I need to stop Brainiac.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.328
He could find me again, find us.

50:39.495 --> 50:41.964
Clark, you said so yourself:

50:42.122 --> 50:44.170
Brainiac thinks Superman is dead.

50:44.333 --> 50:47.928
We're both safe, as long as we leave it that way.

50:48.087 --> 50:53.344
I'm willing to live without Superman
as long as I have you...

50:53.509 --> 50:56.183
...the man behind the glasses.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.439
It's not only us, Lois.

50:58.597 --> 51:01.567
All of Metropolis is in danger, our entire planet.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.978
If I don't stop Brainiac, who will?

51:04.144 --> 51:07.899
Special Ops, Navy SEALS, that Green Lantern guy.

51:08.732 --> 51:11.155
Somethings not right.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.116
Everything is right. Don't you see'?

51:13.279 --> 51:17.204
I'm here, Clark, with you, just like you wanted.

51:17.366 --> 51:21.587
You wouldn't know what I wanted,
not unless I told you or unless...

51:21.745 --> 51:24.373
This isn't Metropolis.

51:24.832 --> 51:27.130
I never left.

51:28.294 --> 51:30.296
No, wait.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.681
Unh. Clark, don't leave me!

51:32.840 --> 51:35.218
You're not Lois, you're a phantom.

51:35.384 --> 51:38.308
Lois is still in Metropolis.

52:06.540 --> 52:09.043
We've done everything We can.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.555
I don't expect her to last the hour.

52:20.095 --> 52:22.143
Hey, lamebrain!

52:24.558 --> 52:26.652
Leave planet Earth now...

52:26.810 --> 52:30.531
...or feel the might of the new Man of Steel.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.781
Look!

52:37.446 --> 52:39.949
I destroyed Superman.

52:40.115 --> 52:44.040
Destroying you, Lex Luthor, will be a snap.

52:46.413 --> 52:49.508
Ooh. He really milks the drama.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.796
You're going down, clown!

52:57.966 --> 52:59.593
Come on!

53:15.609 --> 53:17.156
Spread out.

53:19.655 --> 53:23.034
Appreciate the Method acting, but go easy, fella.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.747
Bad back.

53:24.910 --> 53:30.041
Acting? Did you really think I would ever
hand Earth over to you, Luthor?

53:30.207 --> 53:32.835
Well, actually, Brainy, no.

53:33.252 --> 53:36.131
So remember those goodies
I packed into your shuttle?

53:36.296 --> 53:41.848
I threw in a little hidden Easter egg called
"self-destruct mechanism."

53:42.010 --> 53:45.264
So nice working with you.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.397
Huh? Huh?

53:49.852 --> 53:52.651
You underestimate my intelligence.

53:52.813 --> 53:57.990
My biotechnics located your mechanism,
which I deactivated.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.404
Oh, boy.

53:59.570 --> 54:03.666
Now I shall deactivate you.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.083
Ow!

54:51.580 --> 54:53.924
Come on, get enough coverage, Olsen.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.835
There's bound to be something incriminating here.

54:58.212 --> 54:59.589
This area is restricted.

54:59.755 --> 55:03.976
I was just, uh, looking for the little boys' room.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.351
The film.

55:05.511 --> 55:09.186
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak to Mr.
White about that.

55:09.348 --> 55:12.227
<i>Editor in chief of the Daily Planet?</i>

55:12.726 --> 55:15.696
Hmm. You know something, newsboy?

55:15.854 --> 55:17.276
You're kind of cute.

55:17.439 --> 55:19.157
I... I am?

55:19.316 --> 55:20.989
Too bad I have to break you.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.339
- Look!
- Up in the sky!

55:38.502 --> 55:41.005
It's Superman!

55:41.171 --> 55:42.718
Yay.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.141
What?

55:54.935 --> 55:57.734
The son of Krypton lives?

55:57.896 --> 55:59.148
But how?

55:59.314 --> 56:01.487
Long story, Brainiac.

56:01.650 --> 56:04.244
One I don't have time to share.

57:29.404 --> 57:31.953
Give me that film!

57:46.672 --> 57:47.764
Huh?

57:48.966 --> 57:51.765
Oh, no! Aah!

58:23.500 --> 58:26.174
Rooting for you, my man.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.517
No!

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:14.281
Superman!

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.828
The reactor's gonna blow!

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.584
You want your camera, newsboy?

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.593
Come and get it.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.905
Fun dancing with you, Mercy.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.244
But I will take my camera, thank you.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.885
Oh! Oh, man.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.292
Whoa. Whoa!

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.558
Good game, Supey.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.473
You and I make strange allies, but...

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:48.244
In any event, how lucky
for the original Man of Steel...

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:52.579
...that my patented Lexosuit
softened up Brainiac for him, huh? Huh?

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.088
Oh. Huh?

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:34.871
So that is what provides
the son of Krypton with newfound power.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.455
No!

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.124
She fought bravely, Superman...

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:23.461
...but there's no more time.

01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:11.421
Clark?

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.435
No, Lois.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:21.849
It's me, Superman.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:49.884
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.386
<i>That is, what remains of it.</i>

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.389
I'll rebuild it, with your help.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.425
<i>And Ms. Lane?</i>

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.928
A clean bill of health.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:04.314
Though I came close, too close, to losing her.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:08.152
It's best for her safety if I keep my distance.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.904
It's best for Lois...

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.904
<i>...if Clark Kent retires from the Daily Planet.</i>

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.323
Sure, I got a little banged up...

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:25.337
...but self-sacrifice comes with the territory
when you're Metropolis' protector.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:30.082
Uh, me and Superman, that is. Heh.

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:34.880
In fact, you might say I'm Superman's pal.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:38.220
Actually, I believe that honor belongs
to Jimmy Olsen of the Planet.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:41.478
What about reports that your bodyguard
assaulted the Olsen kid?

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:42.933
He was trespassing.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.272
Poor girl thought he was a burglar.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.776
Another thing, Mr. Luthor.
This was found within Brainiac's remains.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.609
The LexCorp logo is inscribed on its underside.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.363
Do you care to comment?

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:58.657
Mercy, phone my attorneys.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:07.420
All of them.

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:11.545
Told you Mercy would eat you alive.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.382
Yeah, she's a real tiger.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.174
I failed you, Mr. White. I didn't get the story.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.467
Well, stick to photography, Olsen.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:24.558
I got one of my ace newshounds back.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:26.935
Hey, what about lunch?

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.060
I think you're covered, Jimmy.

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:37.283
I heard you like cheeseburgers and chili fries.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:40.366
Yeah. You betcha.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.781
Where is your other ace newshound, anyway?

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:45.200
It's not that he didn't wanna be here, Lois.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.415
You know, chief, the thing about Clark...

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.798
...you hardly notice him when he's around.
But when he's not...

01:10:55.293 --> 01:11:00.140
- Clark!
- I, uh, came as soon as I could, Lois.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.471
Guess I missed all the excitement.

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.106
It's good to see you, Clark.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.941
White.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.482
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.026
Kent, you're back not a moment too soon.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:24.915
Seems some superpowered imp
calling himself Mr. Mxyz... Mxyz...

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.494
Aw, whatever he's called.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:30.082
He's causing some kind of cockamamie
topsy-turvy down at the Wharf.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:33.248
Mr. White... Uh, Perry...

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:34.916
...this is hard for me.

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.756
Maybe harder than almost anything
I've ever had to say.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:39.136
It's about my job.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.469
The reason I returned was to let you know that...

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.012
...I don't think I can work...

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.432
Lane?

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.313
I'm on it, chief.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:58.656
The wharf. And step on it.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.286
Lane sure lives dangerously.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.118
Yes.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.658
Yes, she does.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.998
Whether I'm around or not.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.709
So, Kent, about the job?

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.090
You don't think you can what?

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:19.506
Don't think I can be
your foreign correspondent, Perry.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.671
I was really homesick.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.595
We missed you too, Kent.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.310
I think Lois will be just fine...

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:32.940
...as long as Superman and Clark Kent
are around to look out for her.
