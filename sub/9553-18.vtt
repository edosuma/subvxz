Oh...

01:31.260 --> 01:34.260
(no audio)

01:34.760 --> 01:36.260
(singing)
All right,
cut it out, Marion.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.210
Oh, you're
going to be

01:37.760 --> 01:39.180
the cutest chaperone
at the prom.

01:39.180 --> 01:43.520
I asked you to rent me
just a plain, black tuxedo.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.890
Well, black is
out, Howard.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.770
This is hep... I
mean, it's spiffy,

01:47.770 --> 01:49.640
snazzy, gives
you pizzazz.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.610
You really think so?

01:50.610 --> 01:53.110
Pizzazz? Hmm.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.620
Ooh... nice
tuxedo, Dad.

01:58.120 --> 01:58.990
Here it comes.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.320
Did it come with batteries?

02:04.410 --> 02:06.410
Why didn't you put
the address in your wallet?

02:06.410 --> 02:08.410
Because I always lose things
in my wallet.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.410
That's why I put it
in my glove compartment.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.920
It's hard to lose
a glove compartment.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.380
Hey, Howie...

02:14.380 --> 02:15.720
nice tuxedo.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.050
(Ralph chuckling)

02:18.050 --> 02:19.470
Is he gonna be
a chaperone,

02:19.470 --> 02:20.970
or are they hanging
him from the middle

02:20.970 --> 02:22.260
of the gym and
spinning him?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.390
I'm going to spin <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">you{\r}.</font></font></i>

02:24.390 --> 02:26.010
No, no, no, Dad,
please, please don't.

02:26.010 --> 02:28.850
I'm going upstairs
and take off this neon suit.

02:28.850 --> 02:31.350
Oh, Joanie, go up and tell
him how nice he looks.

02:31.850 --> 02:32.850
It looks great, Dad.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.360
Jenny Piccalo has a
nightgown just like it.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.860
I don't want you

02:36.860 --> 02:39.110
hanging around
that Jenny Piccalo.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.360
She's a 15-year-old
Mae West!

02:41.360 --> 02:42.860
How are we supposed
to play a bar mitzvah

02:43.360 --> 02:44.860
when we don't even know
where it is?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.870
Boys, why don't you just go out

02:46.870 --> 02:49.370
and get the address out
of Ralph's glove compartment?

02:49.370 --> 02:52.370
Because his car is locked
in Fonzie's garage.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.370
Oh, dear.

02:53.370 --> 02:54.870
And we can't
find Fonzie

02:54.870 --> 02:56.380
because it's Friday.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.880
Every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday night,

02:58.380 --> 03:00.180
Fonzie meets
with some mystery lady.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.850
Now, come on, Ralph.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.220
You wrote the name down.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.220
You must be able to
remember where it is.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.220
I got it!
Good!

03:06.220 --> 03:07.640
RICHIE:
Oh, good,
I knew he'd get it.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.520
I remember that the place
has a girl's name in it.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.030
I told you I'd remember.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.030
Good, good, that...
that's good,

03:14.030 --> 03:17.030
we'll look it up
in the phone book.
All right, great.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.730
What are we gonna do,
look for every place

03:21.230 --> 03:22.240
that has
a girl's name in it?

03:22.240 --> 03:23.740
Yeah.
We'll never find it!

03:23.740 --> 03:25.740
That's hopeless,
my whole life is hopeless!

03:26.240 --> 03:27.120
Yeah, we know
that, Ralph.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.710
Oh, God doesn't want me
to go to the prom.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.080
Oh, Ralph, it will
be all right.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.420
When Fonzie comes
home at 9:30,

03:35.970 --> 03:37.250
he'll open
the garage.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.470
Oh, no, no, Mom,
9:30's gonna be

03:38.470 --> 03:39.920
much too late,
we've got to...

03:42.590 --> 03:45.390
Mom... how do you know

03:45.390 --> 03:46.810
what time Fonzie's
coming home?

03:47.730 --> 03:49.900
You know, boys, I've
been wondering

03:49.900 --> 03:52.400
where you've decided
to go to college.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.900
Oh, Ralph,
you look so nice.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.400
Thank you,
thank you, Mrs. C.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.900
Mom...
Doesn't he?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.400
Mom... how do you know

03:58.400 --> 04:00.410
Fonzie's coming home
at 9:30?

04:00.410 --> 04:01.910
Oh, did I...
did I actually say that?

04:01.910 --> 04:02.910
Yes.
I wasn't...
RALPH:
Mrs. C?

04:02.910 --> 04:03.910
Yes, Ralph, what, dear?

04:03.910 --> 04:04.910
Uh, Mrs. C., um,

04:04.910 --> 04:06.910
nobody knows where
Fonzie's been hanging out

04:06.910 --> 04:08.280
for the last couple
of months-- nobody.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.170
Oh, that's right, so
how would I know?

04:10.170 --> 04:12.170
You didn't pull
9:30 out of a hat.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.670
Oh, just a guess,
just a wild guess,

04:13.670 --> 04:15.170
and not a bad...
good guess at all,

04:15.170 --> 04:17.120
kind of a bad guess,
not a hat-- oh...

04:17.120 --> 04:19.010
Mrs. C., why don't you
just sit down?

04:19.010 --> 04:20.459
All right, thank you.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.960
We need information,
and we need it now.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.960
Oh, Ralph,

04:24.960 --> 04:26.470
this is my mother you're
talking to, you know?

04:26.470 --> 04:29.470
All right,
excuse me, Mrs. C.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.800
Look, Rich, we'll just try
to scare her a little.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.520
You know, you better
stay out of it.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.530
You're too close, okay?

04:36.530 --> 04:38.530
All right, Mrs. C.

04:38.530 --> 04:40.530
Now, you know you're
like a mother to us.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.400
Yes, Ralph.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.730
But, you're not leaving
this room

04:42.730 --> 04:44.120
until you tell us
where Fonzie is.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.450
Right, and we mean business!

04:45.450 --> 04:46.450
All right,
start talking.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.950
Boys, I don't like
being treated this way.

04:48.450 --> 04:49.740
Richard, they are
threatening me.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.320
I can't help you,
Mom, I'm too close.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.130
You're not that close,
Rich-- come on, break her.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.080
All right, all right,
all right, now, Mom?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.580
This is on
your head now.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.470
No bar mitzvah.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.750
And, Mom, we're not gonna
have any money

05:02.750 --> 05:04.250
to go to our senior prom,

05:04.250 --> 05:05.760
our one and only
senior prom.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.260
No prom.
All right.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.760
No girls.
All right,
I'll tell you.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.760
Yeah?
I can't tell you.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.680
(boys groaning)
I promised-- oh, Ralph, please!

05:12.680 --> 05:14.150
Think of the name
of the club.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.100
Don't hit me, Mrs. C.!

05:15.100 --> 05:16.400
Help me, Rich, help!
Oh, Ralph,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.270
dear, I'm so sorry, dear.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.270
It's... it's just
the pressure.

05:20.270 --> 05:22.770
All right,
I'll tell you,

05:22.770 --> 05:25.240
but you have got to promise
that you won't tell a soul.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.280
Oh, we promise, not
a soul, Mrs. C.
Sure, never,
we won't tell anyone.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.780
Fonzie has been...

05:28.780 --> 05:29.700
Yeah, yeah?
Yeah, yeah?
He's at...

05:29.700 --> 05:31.660
Jefferson High School-- there.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.670
RICHIE:
Jefferson?
I've said it.

05:32.670 --> 05:35.170
I've said it.

05:35.170 --> 05:38.420
He's been going to night school.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.790
Boy, did she spill
her guts.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.430
WOMAN:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Mr. Fonzarelli{\r},</font></font></i>

05:47.430 --> 05:49.720
please recite tonight's poem.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.600
Sure, I'll read
this one, you know,

05:51.600 --> 05:55.610
just for, uh, Michelle
here, all right.
(giggling)

05:56.110 --> 06:00.610
"I Love You"
by Ella Wheeler Wilcox.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.610
(giggling)

06:01.610 --> 06:04.110
Thanks very much,
Michelle.

06:04.110 --> 06:09.120
"I love your lips
when they're wet with wine

06:09.120 --> 06:11.990
and red
with wild desire."

06:11.990 --> 06:13.910
Uh, please, uh, read that again,

06:14.410 --> 06:17.290
and tell me, what does
that line mean to you?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.630
Whoa!

06:24.580 --> 06:26.840
Good, you understand.

06:28.970 --> 06:32.260
FONZIE:
"I love your eyes
when the love light

06:32.260 --> 06:36.260
lies lit with a
passionate fire."

06:36.260 --> 06:37.260
Huh, dig it, whoa.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.730
"I love your arms

06:39.730 --> 06:42.690
"when the warm,
white flesh

06:42.690 --> 06:45.190
touches mine
in a fond embrace."

06:45.190 --> 06:45.990
Whoa.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.580
"I love your hair
when the strands

06:50.580 --> 06:55.580
enmesh and your kisses
against my face", Michelle.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.620
(sighs passionately)
Yeah.

07:00.870 --> 07:02.420
You do quite
well for someone

07:02.420 --> 07:04.210
who doesn't like
to recite poetry.

07:04.210 --> 07:05.960
Oh, of course.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.960
The class will take a
ten-minute break to cool off.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here

07:19.310 --> 07:21.610
Fonz, we've got
to see you.

07:21.610 --> 07:24.610
This isn't happening.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.110
(moaning)

07:26.110 --> 07:27.610
(French accent):
Oh, don't leave,
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">mon cher{\r}.</font></font></i>

07:27.610 --> 07:29.620
Hey, yeah, we'll
share, we'll share.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.120
You just sit tight.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.120
Memorize some American
words, will you?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.040
Get over here.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.490
Malph... will you
get over here, Malph?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.990
Find your own.

07:37.990 --> 07:38.990
Right, Fonz.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.290
What are you doing here?

07:40.290 --> 07:42.080
Well, Fonz, we've
got a problem.
Yeah.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.910
Your mother told
you where I was?

07:43.910 --> 07:45.800
Yeah, she did, but she
wouldn't have, Fonz,

07:45.800 --> 07:47.300
not if it wasn't
a big emergency.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.670
Yeah, Fonz,
an emergency.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.420
What are you,
a parrot?

07:50.420 --> 07:51.840
Yeah, you see, we...

07:51.840 --> 07:53.310
we've got to play
this bar mitzvah,

07:53.310 --> 07:55.260
and the address is locked
up in your garage.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.180
And Malph
doesn't know

07:57.640 --> 07:59.680
where the place
is, <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">correcto{\r}?</font></font></i>

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Correcto, Fonz.
Fabbo{\r}.</font></font></i>

08:01.680 --> 08:03.350
I got it!
There he goes again.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.350
The name
of the place is Beth.

08:05.350 --> 08:06.350
I knew it
was a girl's name.

08:06.850 --> 08:07.690
Beth Israel.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.490
Come on, let's hurry up,
we don't want to be late.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.490
Right... see you,
Fonz, have fun.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.500
Fonz?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I was gonna ask you
what you're doing here,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
but, uh, I
can tell.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, I bet you can,
and so can your mother.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.510
Oh, uh, don't blame that
on her, Fonz, really.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.010
Don't you have
someplace to go?

08:27.010 --> 08:28.010
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

08:28.010 --> 08:29.290
Fonz?
Yeah?

08:29.290 --> 08:31.090
What are you studying?

08:31.090 --> 08:32.549
Foreign Relations?

08:32.549 --> 08:34.010
(chuckling)

08:36.470 --> 08:37.970
Where was I?

08:37.970 --> 08:39.970
Now, they don't know
this yet, you see,

08:39.970 --> 08:40.970
but those
are my pals,

08:40.970 --> 08:43.470
and I'm going to
graduate with them, huh?

08:43.470 --> 08:45.980
Uh... "graduate"?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.980
Yeah, you know...

08:49.980 --> 08:50.980
Graduate.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.980
(giggles):
Oh, Fonzie.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.400
Hey...

08:56.400 --> 08:57.790
I don't know if
she understands,

08:57.790 --> 09:00.790
but then, I know I
don't care, you know?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.380
MARION:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">You raised money by playing
at the bar mitzva{\r}h</font></font></i>

09:03.880 --> 09:05.380

09:08.830 --> 09:10.800
I don't want to be
late to my own prom.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.300
Now, when you get there,
be sure

09:12.800 --> 09:15.300
to stand up straight
so your cummerbund won't sag.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.810
I-I will, Mom.

09:16.810 --> 09:18.810
Well, I got
to get going.

09:18.810 --> 09:20.810
I want to pick up
Arlene a little early.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.810
Her parents want to take
some home movies of us.

09:24.310 --> 09:25.230
(mimicking James Stewart):
I, uh...

09:25.230 --> 09:28.230
I was thinking I might do my
Jimmy Stewart impression.

09:31.490 --> 09:32.990
That's so good.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.490
Yeah, thanks,
Mom, I like it.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.490
Oh, uh, Richard, the boys
haven't said anything

09:37.990 --> 09:39.780
about, uh, Fonzie
going to school?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.950
No, Mom, of course not,
we can keep a secret.

09:41.950 --> 09:42.830
Oh, good, I'm so glad,

09:43.330 --> 09:44.200
'cause I was worried
about that.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.590
Well, you don't
have to worry.

09:45.590 --> 09:47.540
Good.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.590
Oh, well, here
it comes.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.590
She's gonna tell
me I look like

09:51.590 --> 09:54.010
Casper the Friendly
Ghost or Guy Lombardo

09:54.010 --> 09:56.100
or, uh, the
Good Humor Man

09:56.100 --> 09:57.050
or somebody like
that, right?

09:57.050 --> 10:00.850
Not at all, Rich, I think you
look very handsome.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.640
Oh, now, that's nice.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.100
(mimicking James Stewart):
Wow, uh, thank you
there, Joanie.

10:08.060 --> 10:10.860
You know, he did look like
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.650
He did not.

10:12.650 --> 10:13.650
Mom, did you
hear the news?

10:13.650 --> 10:15.650
Fonzie's going
to night school.
No!

10:15.650 --> 10:17.620
Oh, where did
you hear that?

10:17.620 --> 10:19.570

11:29.020 --> 11:30.520
It looks great, Kim.

I don't think it
goes with my dress.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.740
Fussy, fussy.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.240
Look, Kim, it's fresh.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.740
It's the freshest
corsage here.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.240
Ralph's father
has them growing

11:48.240 --> 11:49.740
all over the
backyard.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.210
What do you want?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.710
Anybody can buy
a corsage.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.210
I gave it
the personal touch.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.720
I ripped it
right out of the ground

11:55.720 --> 11:56.630
with my own two hands.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.550
Couldn't you cut off
the roots?

Jefferson's ballroom gymnasium,

12:55.720 --> 12:57.730
Now I take great pleasure

12:57.730 --> 13:00.200
to bring on

Hi, guys.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.460
Hello, Mr. C.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.380
(music stops)

13:17.300 --> 13:18.630
Hello, Arthur.

Come on, stoolie,
I'll buy you a drink.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.470
All right now, Michelle,

13:26.970 --> 13:30.480
I want you to stand
right there.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.810
Right.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.100
All right.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.100
Listen, uh, before we start
the festivities,

13:36.100 --> 13:38.600
I just want to clear the air
about something.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.600
A lot of you have speculated on
why I'm going to night school.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.110
POTSIE:
Yeah.
(chuckles)

13:43.110 --> 13:45.520
Some of you have said that
I-I'm studying to be a teacher.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.860
(crowd murmurs)
That was
going around.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.360
Wrong.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.860
Some of you said that I was
trying to pick up chicks.

13:50.860 --> 13:51.860
(crowd murmurs)

13:51.860 --> 13:53.870
Wrong.

13:53.870 --> 13:56.370
Somebody even said
that I was studying

13:56.370 --> 13:58.370
to get the Nobel Peace Prize.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.620
That was mine.

14:00.620 --> 14:04.430
All very reasonable
possibilities,

14:04.430 --> 14:06.430
all of them incorrect-o.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.020
Now, you see, I wanted
this to be a surprise.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.940
I didn't realize that
certain people had loose lips.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.890
All right, now the fact is
that tonight,

14:20.890 --> 14:23.900
I join you...

14:23.900 --> 14:26.780
as a graduating senior.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.030

14:35.570 --> 14:37.040
I know you're proud;
I'm proud, too.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.830
Now, the thing is that, uh,
I will be available tonight

14:41.830 --> 14:43.750
to sign all your
yearbooks, all right?

14:43.750 --> 14:44.670
Have a good time.

14:45.170 --> 14:45.670
All right.

14:46.170 --> 14:46.670

14:47.140 --> 14:47.920
Thank you, Fonzie.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.840
Oh, excuse me, Fonzie.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.140
This girl was

14:55.140 --> 14:57.850
just stung by a bee.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.900
Well, I think you'd better
go to the ladies' room,

14:59.900 --> 15:00.900
put some mud on it.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.770
Mud is good.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.690
I be right back.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.650
You do that.

15:09.190 --> 15:11.660
Arthur, I don't
have loose lips.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.030
No, Mom, I-I don't think that
he was talking about you.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.700
If the lip fits, wear it.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.000
Yeah, well, he-he didn't
mean it that way.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.460
I know what he meant.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.960

15:24.960 --> 15:25.960
You know, Fonzie,

15:25.960 --> 15:27.960
I don't blame you
for being upset

15:27.960 --> 15:30.960
at the way Marion was
shooting off her big mouth.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.270
But also, I'd like
to remind you,

15:36.270 --> 15:38.770
she does do
some nice things, too.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.770
You know, she gets up
early in the morning,

15:40.770 --> 15:42.780
and she makes your breakfast.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.780
She fills your little
thermos bottle

15:45.280 --> 15:46.650
and cooks your vegetables.

15:46.650 --> 15:47.980
Well, I'll tell
you one thing,

15:48.480 --> 15:50.320
she's very good with my
veggies, that's true.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.150
And I think that there comes
a time in everyone's life

15:54.150 --> 15:56.660
when they make at least
one mistake, you know?

15:59.630 --> 16:03.630
Uh, Michelle, would you,
uh, care to dance with me?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.000

21:28.790 --> 21:31.160
But if you don't pass,
you don't graduate.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.070
(murmurs)

21:32.070 --> 21:35.880
And now, you may go back
to having your fun.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.750
(clamoring)

21:42.250 --> 21:45.250
Some of the seniors may not
have heard my announcement,

21:45.250 --> 21:47.060
so please make sure
that they hear it.

21:47.060 --> 21:50.840
I understand that you're
very good at spreading the word.

21:54.350 --> 21:56.230
He flunked the
whole class!

21:56.230 --> 21:58.730
Big deal. I didn't like
Health and Hygiene anyway.

21:58.730 --> 22:01.190
Potsie, don't you realize
we're not graduating now?

22:01.570 --> 22:03.160
Oh, sure we will.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.020
We're all gonna study right
after we go watch the sunrise.

22:06.270 --> 22:07.360
Yeah.
Sunrise?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.860
Uh, we're not
watching any sunrise.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.200
We've got to go
to Kim's and study.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.580
Oh, yeah.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.580
I'll meet you up on
Blueberry Hill some other night.

22:14.080 --> 22:14.580
(groans)

22:15.000 --> 22:15.580
Bye.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.090
I'm sorry about
the bee sting.

22:18.090 --> 22:19.590
POTSIE:
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

22:20.010 --> 22:21.540
No sunrise.

22:23.590 --> 22:26.600
Richard, we'll discuss
how this happened tomorrow.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
But right now,
I think you guys

22:28.100 --> 22:29.100
better go home
and start studying.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.600
Now, calm
down, Howard.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.050
We'll go home and we'll make
some coffee for the boys.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.470
I can't
believe this.

22:38.470 --> 22:39.980
Of all nights...
We're not
gonna graduate.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.480
We're gonna be stuck here
for another year.
(all chattering)

22:41.480 --> 22:42.360
What are we gonna do?
I don't...

22:42.610 --> 22:44.700
Stop moaning.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.530
You're gonna pass this test,
you're gonna graduate.

22:46.780 --> 22:48.870
Oh, come on, Fonz,
it's out of the question.

22:48.870 --> 22:50.290
The test is
tomorrow morning at 8:30.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.200
Let me tell you something,
I think you're forgetting

22:52.200 --> 22:53.710
that you got graduation,

22:53.710 --> 22:55.710
one of the most important
things in your life.

22:55.710 --> 22:57.210
You got your big five.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.160
You got life,
you got death,

22:58.710 --> 23:00.630
you got marriage,
you got graduation.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.050
Yeah, but, Fonz,
that's only four.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.380
What's number five?

23:04.580 --> 23:06.170
Heyyy.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.670
RALPH:
Oh, I like number five.

23:08.670 --> 23:10.170
Listen up.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.670
I want you at my place
in 20 minutes.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.560
You're gonna study your little
heads off, you understand?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.400
All right, you're gonna
graduate with me.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.900
I didn't go through night school
to graduate by myself, dig it?

23:19.900 --> 23:20.900
Right, Fonz.
Okay, Fonz.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.900
All right,
departez-vous.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.400
Yeah, okay, Fonz.
Yeah, okay, Fonz, yeah.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.410
Oh, shh.
What a night.

23:27.410 --> 23:30.410
We blew the sunrise, and now
we're not gonna graduate.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.410
It's worse
than that, Rich,

23:31.910 --> 23:34.410
We're gonna have to give back
our graduation presents.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.420
I didn't get any!

23:38.420 --> 23:40.500
Well, it's that time again.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.510
And time for the last dance
of the evening.

23:43.510 --> 23:46.510

in our own way...
