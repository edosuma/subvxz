00:42.360 --> 00:45.480
You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.040
Hey, yo, turn off
the brights.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
[Boy]
Yeah.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.640
We know who
you are.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.640
[Girl]
Really? Who are we?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.840
[Frank]
OK, I give up.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.080
We're surrounded
by monsters.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.160
Ooh, I'm so scared.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.600
[Girl]
You see us every week,

01:06.600 --> 01:10.080
but... do you
really know us?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.080
[Boy] Do you
really know anyone?

01:13.080 --> 01:16.640
[Girl]
Even yourselves?

01:19.160 --> 01:21.600
If you stare long enough,

01:21.600 --> 01:24.960
you might see
a stranger here.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.600
Are we having
a story tonight,

01:26.600 --> 01:28.360
or are we just
playing games?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.600
Does that answer
your question?

01:37.200 --> 01:42.200
My story is about
strangers among us.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.640
You see them
every day

01:46.640 --> 01:49.640
but never take
the time to look,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.120
but if you did,

01:51.120 --> 01:54.120
you might find that
the scariest strangers

01:54.120 --> 01:58.240
are the ones
inside ourselves.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.080
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:08.080 --> 02:09.759
I call this story...

02:20.160 --> 02:23.080
No one lived on the top floor,

02:23.080 --> 02:27.600
the thirteenth floor
of the old renovated building.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.120
The last tenants
had disappeared years ago...

02:32.120 --> 02:36.320
Vanished into thin air.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.600
Be careful now.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.040
Remember
what happened

02:41.040 --> 02:42.280
to the last people
who lived up here.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.520
What?

02:43.520 --> 02:45.800
As if we haven't heard this
a million times.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.160
No one knows.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.960
Gus, you always
say that.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.600
It's just I don't
like you kids

02:51.600 --> 02:53.120
playing up here
by yourselves,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.440
and the thirteenth floor
on top of it.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.760
Makes me uneasy.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.080
Thirteenth floor--
whoo... spooky.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.560
Come on. Let's play.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.960
[Betty Ann]
Karin and her brother Billy

03:13.960 --> 03:15.560
lived on the twelfth floor

03:15.560 --> 03:17.440
and used the thirteenth
as their own private space.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.560
Can't we
do something

03:18.560 --> 03:19.760
I'm good at
for a change?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.920
[Karin]
Billy!

03:23.440 --> 03:25.080
I hate sports.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.080
Come on.
I'll go easy on you.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.560
Just keep your eye
on the ball.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.600
[Betty Ann]
No one ever went up there,

03:30.600 --> 03:34.000
so they always
had the place to themselves,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.880
but that was
soon going to change.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.560
Yeah! All right.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.600
OK, OK.
I can do this.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.000
Slap shot.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.310
OK.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.120
Ah, I think the
net's right there.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.600
I know that.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.120
If I had your genes,
I could do it.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.040
What have my jeans
got to do with it?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.560
Not your blue jeans,
zipper head.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.040
Your
biological genes.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.080
My real parents must
have been klutzes like me.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.080
Will you
get off that?

04:09.080 --> 04:11.080
You can't use your
adoption as an excuse

04:11.080 --> 04:12.560
every time you can't
do something.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
Why not?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.080
It's very
convenient.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.320
[Whirring and rumbling]

04:21.959 --> 04:23.080
What was that?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.720
I don't know.
Come on. Let's split.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.640
Come on.
Come on.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.760
Going down?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.080
Where's Gus?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.600
Gus was called away.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.120
He had an emergency.

04:57.120 --> 05:02.400
I'm Leonid-- the replacement
elevator operator.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.640
Come on.
We'll walk.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.080
Hello, Karin.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.080
How are you?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.600
We've come for
a little visit.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.040
Are you talking to me?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.280
What do you think?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.880
I think I'm dreaming.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.440
13, please.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.040
Oh, I'm sorry,

06:17.040 --> 06:19.880
but the new tenants
are fumigating today.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.240
What
new tenants?

06:21.240 --> 06:22.640
That's our place.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.000
Going down?

06:25.640 --> 06:27.120
No, thanks.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.080
[Karin] I had another
recurring dream.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.440
[Billy]
You mean the one

06:39.440 --> 06:40.920
where you're flying
through outer space?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.120
No. Another one.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.080
There was this guy.
He was on television--

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
What's this?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.600
For Karin.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.080
It doesn't have your
last name or any stamps.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.080
Maybe it's
a secret admirer.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.280
I wish.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.520
"The toy factory."

07:00.520 --> 07:03.120
What is it?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.520
An invitation from a toy
company on the thirteenth floor.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.040
That's who moved in.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.560
What's a toy company doing
in an apartment building?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.560
They want to
test new toys

07:11.560 --> 07:13.040
and sports equipment
on kids,

07:13.040 --> 07:14.560
and I'm invited.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
Why you?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
Why not?

07:16.560 --> 07:19.120
It's for anytime
tomorrow.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.840
I don't want to go.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.560
They didn't invite
me. They want you.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.560
I'm not good
at sports stuff.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.080
I'd get embarrassed.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.280
So what?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.080
Maybe they'll give
away some free stuff.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.640
I don't know.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.160
Hello, Karin.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.720
We very much want you
to come tomorrow.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.920
Why?

07:54.920 --> 07:57.600
Because you're
a very special person.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.080
It wouldn't be
the same without you.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.080
Say you'll come.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.680
OK. Yeah, yeah.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.040
[Billy]
What changed your mind?

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
I don't know.
I just did.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
But you got to
come with me.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.560
They didn't
invite me.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.560
Billy, please.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
All right.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.120
I want to
check this out, too.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
Race you
up the stairs?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.039
I win.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.080
As usual.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.640
[Whirring]

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
Wow!

09:01.840 --> 09:03.240
This is wild.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.520
Hello. I'm Olga,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.520
and you must be
Karin.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.480
Yeah. This is
my brother Billy.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.680
I see.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.520
Nice of you to bring
Karin here, Billy.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.040
We won't be
needing you.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.360
Wait. He's with me.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.760
But we only need
one test subject.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.320
She's my sister.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.600
When I leave,
she leaves with me.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.600
Very well.
This way, please.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.560
[Karin] What kind
of toys do you make?

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
You'll see.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.080
What do we get
for doing this?

09:44.080 --> 09:45.560
What do you want?

09:45.560 --> 09:48.080
Well, maybe
some free stuff.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.680
I think that
can be arranged.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.560
[Karin]
Oh, my gosh.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.640
[Billy]
Cool.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.000
[Olga]
Go ahead.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.000
Groovy.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.440
This is Raymond,
our technician.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.600
He will explain
everything to you.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.040
Hello.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.120
<i> Both children?</i>

10:23.120 --> 10:26.920
Yes, both children.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.240
What do we
have to do?

10:28.240 --> 10:31.120
Each of these buttons
plays a note.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.400
[Plays musical notes]

10:33.400 --> 10:36.120
I will play several
notes in a row.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.600
Then you must
hit the buttons

10:37.600 --> 10:39.440
and repeat
the sequence.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.640
Sounds like
a test.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.000
[Raymond]
It's a race

10:42.000 --> 10:44.640
to see who can
react the fastest.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.200
A coordination game.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.320
Forget it.
I'll lose.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.080
There are no winners
in this game.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.000
What's this
got to do with toys?

10:54.000 --> 10:58.360
Ah, this helps us
in our design process.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.640
[Plays musical notes]

11:07.360 --> 11:09.800
Piece of cake.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
Here, like this.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.760
No helping.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.440
We'll try again.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.800
[Whirring changes pitch]

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
See? You're
getting it.

11:44.880 --> 11:48.120
Yeah. All right!
This is fun.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.800
For once, I'm winning.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.560
Again!

12:00.560 --> 12:01.360
[Billy]
Just wait.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.960
Wait.
I'll get it.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.320
Are you OK?

12:04.320 --> 12:06.080
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.800
I can do this.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.440
[Raymond]
Billy.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.640
Keep at it until
you get it right.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.600
Karin... while
he's practicing,

12:21.600 --> 12:25.160
we can move on
to the next game.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.120
Will she be ready?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.600
Yes, but the boy
is with her.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
Unfortunate.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.600
We don't have
much time.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.120
We must leave
by 6:00.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.160
She will be ready.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.600
[Raymond] I think you're
going to like this next test.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.120
So far, so good.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.640
What's this for?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.120
It's all right,
my dear.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.120
We're going to stimulate
parts of your brain

12:57.120 --> 12:58.880
you've never used before.

12:58.880 --> 13:03.280
You will reach your full
mental and physical powers soon.

13:03.280 --> 13:07.080
Now, I want you to
stare at this ball

13:07.080 --> 13:09.240
and move it
with your mind.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.680
What?

13:10.680 --> 13:14.560
Close your eyes. Let your
thoughts surround the ball.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.160
Hold it in your mind.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.600
Now open your eyes
and point.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.800
Push it with your mind.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.680
Good.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.880
Very good.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.080
You're doing that,
right?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.600
Make it do
something else

13:39.600 --> 13:41.160
and don't
tell me what.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.760
Wow.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.120
Am I really
doing that?

13:54.120 --> 13:55.680
Billy, look.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.920
[Karin] What's
wrong with him?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.040
We have a surprise
for you.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.560
We're going on a trip.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.640
No. I don't
want to go.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
Ugh.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.240
Stop that!
You're hurting him.

14:13.240 --> 14:17.080
I am simulating the
atmospheric pressure of home.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.880
We want to be sure
you will survive there.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.080
Where?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.520
What are you
talking about?

14:22.520 --> 14:25.080
Once you have reached
your median capacity,

14:25.080 --> 14:28.600
we will transfer you
to the ship.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.080
What ship?

14:30.080 --> 14:33.280
I'm not going
in any ship!

14:33.280 --> 14:36.080
Ah, that's better.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.120
Aah!

14:37.120 --> 14:38.360
Aah!

14:38.360 --> 14:39.520
Aah!

14:39.520 --> 14:40.600
Aah!

14:40.600 --> 14:41.560
Aah!

14:41.560 --> 14:45.200
Billy, help me!
Let me out!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.040
[Screaming]

14:53.320 --> 14:54.280
Help me!

14:54.280 --> 14:55.360
Aah!

14:55.360 --> 14:57.680
[Screaming]

15:03.720 --> 15:06.440
Aah! Billy, help!

15:10.880 --> 15:13.440
[Raymond]
What are you doing?

15:13.440 --> 15:15.520
Stop this. Now.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.600
[Karin] Knock
off, bullet head.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.200
Whatever you did
to me, buddy...

15:26.200 --> 15:28.280
Thanks.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.720
Billy. Billy,
are you OK?

15:30.720 --> 15:33.720
Come on. We've got to
get out of here.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.280
[Olga] Raymond,
what's all that noise?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.280
I'll be back.
I'm going to get help.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.880
[Footsteps]

15:51.520 --> 15:52.720
Ahh.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.920
Raymond.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.320
[Olga] We don't
have time for this.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.760
[Computer] Atmosphere
at .07 and falling.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.760
Boy will not survive.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.240
Girl reached median
power at .9.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.240
Put this back on.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.360
The atmosphere
is getting low.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.760
We have to be
back on the ship by 6:00.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.800
5:59.30,
to be precise.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.680
We have to find
the girl.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.240
Bring her back.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.760
Such poor specimens,
these earth children.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.720
There you are.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.280
Aah!

16:53.800 --> 16:56.360
Come back, Karin.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.160
Your trip
is just beginning.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.240
Please work.
Please work.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.800
[Rumbling]

17:11.200 --> 17:12.640
Yes!

17:27.920 --> 17:33.040
All that fuss just
to end up back here.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.280
Not quite.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.200
Jerk.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.720
Wake up. Wake up.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.720
Come on. We got to
get out of here.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.280
[Computer] Liftoff in 20
earth minutes and counting.

17:58.080 --> 18:02.720
Honestly, Raymond,
not again.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.320
Where is
that remote control?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.760
[Buzzes]

18:18.760 --> 18:20.760
We are running
out of time.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.440
Bring her back.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.480
Oh, my god. Come on.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.120
Come on.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.160
Hurry. Hurry.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.200
Hello, Karin.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.960
Twelfth floor,
please.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.080
I'd hoped we were
all going up.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.280
You, too.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.760
I should have
known.

18:52.760 --> 18:53.480
[Buzz]

18:55.400 --> 18:58.000
We're not all robots,
Karin.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.280
You're letting your
confusion blind you.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.800
Listen to your instincts.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.800
You know this is
your destiny.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.800
It's time to expand
your horizons,

19:10.800 --> 19:13.720
see another side
of the universe.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.800
My destiny?

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
Yes.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.320
Come with us,

19:17.320 --> 19:20.160
and you will
find happiness.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.760
Maybe I will.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.680
That's my girl.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.800
Let's go see Olga.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.240
No!

19:28.240 --> 19:30.800
I've got to get help
for Billy.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.240
[Computer] Liftoff in 15
earth minutes and counting.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.840
[Olga] You can't leave
now. It's almost time.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.280
She was
almost ready.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.520
She'll be back.
She won't leave her brother.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.920
Please,
somebody help me!

19:55.360 --> 19:56.720
Billy!

19:58.360 --> 20:01.840
10 minutes.
What can I do in 10 minutes?

20:04.360 --> 20:07.280
"Motion control.
Vision control.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.800
"Memory access.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.280
"Radar.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.040
Verbal command."
Yes.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.320
Come on.
We got to go.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.240
[Computer] Six earth
minutes and counting.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.480
Come on. We have to
get out of here.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.560
Karin.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.080
Hold Olga.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.280
Ah!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.640
Come on.
You need air.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.640
[Olga]
Let me go!

20:43.640 --> 20:44.960
Karin, no!

20:44.960 --> 20:46.800
[Computer]
Liftoff in two minutes.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.280
[Leonid] Where do you
think you're going?

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
Home.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.960
I knew you'd see
the light.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.960
[Whirring]

20:54.960 --> 20:57.320
It's time.
Let's go.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.360
No way.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.160
You must
trust me, Karin.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.600
Back there,
it's beautiful.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.680
You can fly
like a bird.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.400
You can see through
to other worlds.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.280
What about Billy?

21:10.280 --> 21:11.800
I heard what
they said.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.800
He'd die there.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.840
He doesn't
belong there, karin.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.840
[Computer]
Liftoff in 30 seconds.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.680
[Karin] They'll
leave without you.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.560
You're making
a terrible mistake, Karin.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.400
I don't think so.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.160
[Computer]
10, 9, 8, 7...

21:38.800 --> 21:39.760
What happened?

21:39.760 --> 21:42.240
Who were
those people?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.320
[Whirring and rumbling]

21:56.960 --> 21:58.960
Man, that was
really weird.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.040
I know.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.720
It's my dream.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.760
No, dear, this
isn't a dream.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.040
This was
your rescue.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.520
My rescue?

22:11.520 --> 22:14.160
We left you here by
mistake 10 years ago.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.360
I would have
explained everything

22:16.360 --> 22:17.840
once the proper
atmosphere

22:17.840 --> 22:19.360
brought all of
your senses back.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.440
What's going on?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.240
Can't stay any longer.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.200
We've run out
of atmosphere.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.240
It will be another 10 years
before we can return.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.720
What's she
talking about?

22:29.720 --> 22:32.240
Is this a joke
or what?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.800
Aah!

22:37.120 --> 22:40.680
See you in 10 years.
Good-bye for now, dear.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.760
[Betty Ann] You may
think you know someone,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.760
but think again

22:48.760 --> 22:51.640
and look a little closer.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.760
I declare this meeting

23:01.760 --> 23:05.280
of the Midnight
Society closed...

23:05.280 --> 23:07.320
Whoever you are.
