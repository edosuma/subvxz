WEBVTT

00:11.812 --> 00:13.547
<i>All right, try to get it
all the way up under her nose.</i>

00:13.580 --> 00:16.183
<i>‐All‐all the way...
‐I'm just trying
to stick it in her mouth.</i>

00:16.216 --> 00:18.252
...under her nose should do ita let it kind of waft up.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.753
Oh, she's starting to wake up.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.655
‐There she‐‐ there we go!
‐Wakey, wakey, Dee!

00:21.688 --> 00:23.223
Good, because I'm getting sick
of trying to keep

00:23.257 --> 00:25.092
the‐the hair out of the soup.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.727
It's not soup, it's stew,
okay, and you...

00:26.760 --> 00:28.395
Same thing, don't correct me.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.763
Soup or stew,
you shouldn't feed it

00:29.796 --> 00:30.764
to an unconscious person.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.599
Yeah, but I'm trying
to use it to wake her up.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.234
Look, she's not gonna eat it,
I'm telling you.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.235
It's not gonna wake her up;
I mean,

00:35.269 --> 00:37.070
I don't think stew has
any arousing components.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.138
What are you talking about?!
The smells...

00:38.172 --> 00:39.306
What is this? What's going on?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.607
...the flavors!
That's the whole point

00:40.641 --> 00:42.009
of getting the stew
in the first place.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.710
Wha‐What is this? Where am I?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.245
All right, Dee, remember
yesterday when you were waving

00:45.279 --> 00:47.214
that first‐class ticket
to Ireland in our faces

00:47.247 --> 00:49.082
and bragging about
that acting gig that you got?

00:49.116 --> 00:50.083
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah?

00:50.117 --> 00:51.118
Then you drank yourself

00:51.151 --> 00:52.152
into a stupor and passed out?

00:52.186 --> 00:54.488
I... oh... o‐okay.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.756
Yeah, well, uh, good news.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.357
We took that one
first‐class ticket,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.126
divided it
into five coach tickets.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.261
And then gave you
just enough sleeping pills

01:01.295 --> 01:03.297
to keep you blissfully asleep
so you could enjoy the flight

01:03.330 --> 01:05.232
and wake up here in Dublin
fully rested.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.400
No. No, you didn't!
You didn't do this.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.235
This‐this can't be
happening, no.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.103
‐Yeah, no, we did.
That's exactly what we did.
‐

01:10.137 --> 01:12.239
We absolutely did. Because we
wanted to be supportive.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.741
‐No, you didn't!
‐Because we are always there
for each other.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.444
‐No, we're not!
‐Right, guys?
In good times and in bad.

01:17.477 --> 01:20.347
‐We are.
‐And speaking of time,
um, you are late.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.416
‐You got about 15 minutes
to get to that TV studio.
‐Oh, God.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.151
‐No, no, no, no.
‐
Good thing you woke up.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.286
‐This can't be happening...
‐Well, slow down now.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.789
‐Hey, be sure to look to
the right if you go in the road!
‐Be careful out there.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.791
'Cause they drive
on the other side here!

01:30.824 --> 01:33.627
‐No, no, no, no, no. No.
‐

01:40.100 --> 01:42.703
Oh, goddamn it!
Taxi? Oh, taxi!

01:42.736 --> 01:45.038
‐Taxi! Taxi!
‐

01:47.107 --> 01:49.142
♪ Hey! ♪

02:11.164 --> 02:13.400
‐Car!
‐Yeah, I see it, Frank,

02:13.433 --> 02:15.602
‐I can handle the driving.
‐Oh, just go faster, goddamn it!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.504
I can't believe
you guys did this to me.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.406
Oh, my God, Dee, we are
driving you to work, okay?

02:19.439 --> 02:22.376
We‐we brought you to Ireland.
We brought you here, okay?

02:22.409 --> 02:23.677
We didn't have to do that.
Do you know how hard

02:23.710 --> 02:25.279
it was to get you
through customs?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.147
‐It was wicked hard, yeah.
‐We're doing this for you!

02:27.181 --> 02:29.449
Whatever, okay, I think
the studio's right up here.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.319
I'll call you guys around 6:00
or whenever I'm off.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.588
‐Why?
‐So you can pick me up.

02:34.621 --> 02:37.291
‐What?
‐Dee, we're taking time

02:37.324 --> 02:39.026
out of our Irish vacation
to drive you to work,

02:39.059 --> 02:40.394
now you want us to pick you up?

02:40.427 --> 02:42.763
"Vacation"? You just said
you were here for me!

02:42.796 --> 02:44.364
Well, yeah, we're here for you,

02:44.398 --> 02:45.799
but we're also here
for our vacation.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.501
Yeah, I'm back
in the motherland finally!

02:47.534 --> 02:50.103
I've always wanted to trace
back my family lineage.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.105
I mean, as the most Irish
person here, I really think...

02:52.139 --> 02:54.508
Wait a minute, wait,
whoa, whoa, dude, I'm Irish.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.009
Well, yeah, but you're
not as Irish as me.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.211
I could be. You don't know that.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.712
‐How do you know that?
‐Charlie, I have

02:58.745 --> 03:00.414
a shamrock tattooed on my thigh.

03:00.447 --> 03:03.016
‐So what?
‐I'm gonna show it to you!
You want to see it?!

03:03.050 --> 03:04.284
‐No, stop it!
You're squishing me!
‐Car! Car!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.420
‐I see the car, stop! Mac, stop!
‐Goddamn it.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.021
‐You're kicking my seat, okay?
‐That was close.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.057
Keep your stupid, ugly
shamrock tattoo in your pants.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.125
Why did you have to get the
teeny, tiniest car possible?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.327
‐It is small.
‐I'm getting squished back here

03:13.360 --> 03:14.394
and just sucking in
diesel fumes.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.096
What did you want me to do, Dee?

03:16.129 --> 03:18.232
Did you want me to rent
a big obnoxious American truck

03:18.265 --> 03:19.266
like‐like that one over there?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.001
That's exactly what we're
trying to get away from.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.170
Okay, you know,
the‐the tiny car,

03:23.203 --> 03:25.439
that's all part of the charm
of‐of Europe.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.474
You know, like driving on
the left‐hand side of the road.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.309
Dangerous for Americans like you.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.677
But, you know,
it's authentic and,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.479
and that's what I want,
that's what I'm going for.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.281
‐An authentic Irish...
‐

03:34.314 --> 03:36.483
‐Get fucked!
‐Oh!

03:36.517 --> 03:38.118
...Irish experience.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.187
Okay, just pull over, all right?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.588
Just pull over and let me out!
I'll walk.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.724
You goddamn bastards!

03:47.261 --> 03:50.497
Here I am! "Obnoxious American
MILF" reporting for duty, sir!

03:50.531 --> 03:53.333
You're late. You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.769
I know, I know,
I hit a little bit of traffic.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.638
But if you think about it,
you know, in a way,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.239
I feel like the character
would be late, too,

03:59.273 --> 04:00.741
so it's not really
that big of a...

04:00.774 --> 04:02.109
You're lucky this time‐‐
production's running behind,

04:02.142 --> 04:03.377
so we don't need you
for another hour.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.512
Ah, thank God, okay.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.281
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?

04:08.282 --> 04:09.650
Ah! Ow.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.552
Well, that's...

04:11.585 --> 04:13.387
that's a doozy, isn't it?

04:13.420 --> 04:16.089
We can't shoot you like that‐‐
it‐it's disturbing!

04:16.123 --> 04:18.058
Well, it's not,
it's not even real.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.393
It‐It's just makeup.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.228
It's makeup left over
from the show

04:21.261 --> 04:23.664
‐I did this morning.
‐That's makeup?

04:23.697 --> 04:26.099
Yep, nothing to it
but a little latex and blush.

04:26.133 --> 04:29.136
You know, I just forgot to...
wash... it off.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.506
Um, you know, probably 'cause I
never wear makeup in real life.

04:32.539 --> 04:36.109
'Cause natural beauty.
I'll tell you what, um, since

04:36.143 --> 04:37.778
I do have a little time,
I should just pop out and wash

04:37.811 --> 04:40.414
my face real quick and‐and come
right back, it's not a big deal.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.115
Go on, just go on.
Be back in an hour.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.417
‐And don't be late again.
‐Absolutely. I won't be late.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.686
I'm one wet wipe away
from being your MILF.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.521
Can we get cracking here,
people, come on!

04:47.554 --> 04:49.223
Oh, you're gonna want
to F this so bad!

04:49.256 --> 04:51.458
This is so exciting.

04:51.491 --> 04:53.260
‐Yeah.
‐I already feel like I'm home.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.263
I cannot wait to see the house
that my dad grew up in.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.666
‐Apparently it's been
in my family for generations.
‐Oh.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.102
‐Cool. Yeah, I mean,
I dig it here, man.
‐Yeah.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.770
You know, you get
all the comforts of Philly.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.507
You got drunks, you got
Irish people, you got, um...

05:06.540 --> 05:07.841
I guess that's
the same thing, but, like,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.544
you also get, like, the magical
mystical element of this place,

05:10.577 --> 05:13.313
you know, you get the banshees
and the spirits and the sprites!

05:13.347 --> 05:16.016
And Shelley! Shelley's here,
which is pretty cool.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.118
All of those things are made up,
including Shelley.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.220
‐Shelley's not made up.
‐He's your imaginary friend

05:20.254 --> 05:22.222
‐that you've had
since you were a kid.
‐Dude, he's not my

05:22.256 --> 05:23.524
imaginary friend,
he's my pen pal, okay?

05:23.557 --> 05:24.791
And he's Irish,
that's why his name is Shelley.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.260
A pen pal that writes to you

05:26.293 --> 05:27.261
in a magical language.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.630
Dude, the guy's real, okay?
And this is why

05:29.663 --> 05:32.065
‐I know more about
Ireland than you do.
‐Hey, stop!

05:32.099 --> 05:33.200
Stop right there, all right?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.035
This is why Irish people
hate Americans.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.304
You've got, like,
two percent Irish in you,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.273
and you think you know more
about Ireland than me?

05:39.306 --> 05:41.608
Do you have a shamrock tattoo
somewhere on your body? No.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.077
I do, because that's
my primary identity.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.713
Number one, Irish.
Number two, gay.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.282
Number three, badass.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.550
You're none of those things,

05:49.583 --> 05:50.484
so you should be talking
of none of them.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.386
Are you talking
about what you identify as

05:52.419 --> 05:53.587
or what you actually are?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.322
They're the same thing now,
Charlie.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.192
And I can have you canceled
for even suggesting otherwise.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.326
‐No, right.
‐I have the power to do that.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.561
Because I'm a gay man and you're

06:00.594 --> 06:02.596
just a straight white, cis male.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.431
Yeah. And Irish, so...

06:04.464 --> 06:06.500
Will you just be here for me?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.168
‐Okay.
‐This is a huge day for me

06:08.202 --> 06:09.770
‐and I just,
I feel like you could...
‐Okay.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.572
‐you could support me
a little bit...
‐All right! All right!

06:11.605 --> 06:14.007
I mean, this is the circle
of life coming full‐‐ oh, oh!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.143
Oh! It‐it should be
coming up right here.

06:16.176 --> 06:20.547
Yeah, the House of McDonald is
at this address...

06:20.581 --> 06:22.416
here.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.754
Wow.
Yeah, nailed it.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.358
Cool, so your dad grew up
in a McDonald's or...?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.361
No. No, my dad didn't grow up
in a McDonald's.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.263
You sure? 'Cause this is
the House of McDonald.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.365
Hey, oh, you know what, dude?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.501
Maybe you are, like,
from the McDonald family?

06:40.534 --> 06:43.570
Like, like, are you
the Ronald McDonald?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.472
Like, is the hamburger clown
named after you?

06:45.506 --> 06:48.308
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me right now.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.677
‐Oh?
‐We got to go find out.
I got to, we got to find out.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.346
‐You want to get some
more information on that?
‐Yeah, let's get

06:52.379 --> 06:54.381
‐some more information.
‐Yeah, okay, yeah, 'cause you

06:54.414 --> 06:55.716
could be entitled to
a lot of money.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.055
What the hell is this, Frank?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.557
I‐I thought we were going
to a distillery.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.026
You want an authentic
Irish experience?

07:06.059 --> 07:09.263
There's nothing more Irish
than a corporate tax shelter.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.798
Welcome to the worldwide
headquarters

07:11.832 --> 07:14.668
‐of Frank's Fluids.
‐Uh‐huh.

07:14.701 --> 07:17.137
Goddamn. What's that smell?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.072
What smell?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.508
Oh, it's Ralphie.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.044
Must've got trapped in here.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.546
Looks like he's fused
to the carpet.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.414
‐Uh‐huh. Is that a cat?
‐It was.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.083
Okay, well, that is,
that is grotesque.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.786
‐I can't believe
I don't smell that.
‐It stinks.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.189
‐I don't smell it.
‐Guys! Guys! Hey,
acting emergency.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.424
Oh, goddamn, what is that smell?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.059
‐That's Ralphie. He's fused.
‐Yeah.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.694
‐Oh.
‐Whoa, Dee!

07:40.727 --> 07:43.096
‐That looks bad.
‐Yeah, I got myself
a bit of a hematoma here.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.432
‐Can you guys please help me?
‐It's okay, Dee. I got you,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.201
‐I got you.
This is why we're here.
‐Okay.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.169
‐Yes.
‐You know, lucky for you,
I happen to have experience

07:49.203 --> 07:51.471
covering up blunt force trauma,
so...

07:51.505 --> 07:54.107
‐Oh. Uh‐uh, yeah.
‐Okay, good, so...

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
‐simple fix.
‐Great.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.644
We simply need
to redistribute the blood.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.246
‐Great, do it, let's go.
‐That...

07:59.279 --> 08:00.781
‐Okay.
‐Do it, bitch, go!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.549
All right.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.420
Oh, God!

08:06.453 --> 08:08.722
‐Ooh.
‐

08:08.755 --> 08:10.057
Wow, look at that.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.125
Let me see here.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.228
Oh! Oh, shit.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.196
‐That's like magic.
‐Yeah.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.232
Okay, now you guys can
help me with my thing.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.766
We got to shred
a bunch of documents.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.368
What‐‐ whoa, what?
What are you talking about, man?

08:21.401 --> 08:21.869
Well, the thing of it is, um...

08:26.473 --> 08:30.310
that Frank's Fluidssupplier of Jeffrey Epstein.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.347
‐What?!
‐Jeffrey Epstein?!

08:33.380 --> 08:35.382
Yeah. Yeah, but before you
judge me,

08:35.415 --> 08:38.452
yes, I was on the sex island,

08:38.485 --> 08:40.187
but only for the snorkeling!

08:40.220 --> 08:41.722
I didn't know anything about
the kid stuff.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.191
‐Oh!
‐No, look,
95% of what went on down there

08:44.224 --> 08:46.326
‐was not pedophilia.
‐Oh, yeah?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.794
No, the other five percent,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.596
that sullied
the whole operation.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.131
‐Yeah, it sure did, Frank.
‐It sure did.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.733
Well, you know,
it ain't just me.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.435
Your guys' names are on those
documents, too, remember?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.704
‐What? Still?
‐Goddamn it, Frank!

08:57.738 --> 09:00.040
‐Son of a bitch!
‐No, I don't have time for this!

09:00.073 --> 09:01.642
Well, come on, it'll be quick.
It's only a couple boxes.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.010
‐Ah, shit!
‐Oh...

09:07.548 --> 09:09.316
Goddamn it!

09:16.156 --> 09:18.058
Bullshit.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.060
This one's bullshit.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.462
All these family tree books...

09:22.496 --> 09:24.198
This one just fell apart.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.466
There's so many
"Mc" and "Mac" names, too.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.035
Like, how are we supposed
to find anything?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.570
Dude, I found one right here
in this gibberish book.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.371
There's a whole section
on McDonald.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.373
It's not gibberish,
you just can't read, dude.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.442
Well, uh, well, no, I can
read this. Here, check this out.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.579
"The McDonalds of County Cork

09:38.612 --> 09:41.181
"settled in the Lee Valley

09:41.215 --> 09:43.116
‐as far back as..."
‐Wait, wait, wait,
wait a second.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.219
This is, like, Irish or Gaelic

09:45.252 --> 09:47.387
or whatever, whatever they
call it‐‐ you can read that?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.723
Well, if "Gaelic"
or "Irish" is‐is what you call

09:49.756 --> 09:51.725
the magical gibberish language
that my pen pal taught me,

09:51.758 --> 09:53.393
uh, yes, Mac, I can.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.596
So you're telling me
that you can't read English,

09:55.629 --> 09:58.131
but you can speak and read
an entirely different language?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.666
Uh, I can read it,
I can't speak it.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.101
How can you read something
you can't speak?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.436
‐It doesn't make any sense.
‐I don't know,

10:02.469 --> 10:03.770
it's the mystery
of the magic, I don't know.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.472
Plus, you know,
these are Irish words,

10:05.506 --> 10:07.374
and my mouth is made
for American words naturally...

10:07.407 --> 10:10.644
So your imaginary pen pal was
a real person?

10:10.677 --> 10:12.312
Yes, dude, that's what I've been
telling you this whole time.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.314
My mom was, like, really
invested in me having a pen pal

10:14.348 --> 10:16.650
so she found me this kid,
Shelley Kelly. You know, I...

10:16.683 --> 10:19.453
I'm sorry, your pen pal's name
was Shelley Kelly?

10:19.486 --> 10:22.089
‐Yeah.
‐Have you ever thought
maybe you were related?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.591
‐Why?
‐Because you have
the same last name.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.127
‐He's from Ireland, man!
‐Jesus Christ! Okay, look.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.195
Follow me here for a second‐‐

10:28.228 --> 10:29.329
your mom was a giant whore,
right?

10:29.363 --> 10:31.365
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.667
So maybe she banged
her way through Ireland sometime

10:33.700 --> 10:35.235
in the '70s, right?

10:35.269 --> 10:37.070
And maybe this is,
like, your half brother.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.072
Dude, wait a second.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.475
Now you're finally making some
sense here, because, like,

10:41.508 --> 10:43.477
this guy is like
the Irish version of me.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.379
You know what I mean?
We're into all the same shit.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.447
Um, cheese, ghouls, um...

10:47.481 --> 10:49.583
uh, ghouls, cheese, uh...

10:49.616 --> 10:51.451
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.586
‐You know what the problem is?
‐Yeah.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.787
This library's got
too many books.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.623
‐And so what I got to do is...
‐You need a phone instead.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.792
‐Well, I got to go
to the source.
‐Of?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.728
I'm gonna call my mommy.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.332
‐

11:06.567 --> 11:08.769
‐Hey, Mommy!
‐Who is this?

11:08.802 --> 11:10.771
It's... it's me, Mac.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.373
‐Oh.
‐Yeah, I'm in Ireland.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.077
I miss you, too.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.779
‐She didn't say that.
‐Yes, she did. She did.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.581
‐Nah, she didn't. She did not.
‐She totally did. Hey, Mom?

11:20.614 --> 11:22.382
Um, so, anyway, um,

11:22.416 --> 11:25.252
we're in Ireland, and I was
looking for Dad's house,

11:25.285 --> 11:27.254
but the address that
you gave me was wrong,

11:27.287 --> 11:29.790
and, like, I kind of can't find
the Luther McDonalds anywhere.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.192
Yeah.

11:32.226 --> 11:34.127
What do you mean, "yeah"?

11:34.161 --> 11:36.496
Do you have any information
on Dad or our heritage?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.465
‐No.
‐What do you mean, "no"?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.067
You're not Irish.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.169
‐
‐I'm not Irish?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.570
‐Yeah.
‐Are you joking?

11:43.604 --> 11:46.640
‐Nope.
‐My last name is McDonald.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.710
‐No.
‐Are you telling me
that Dad changed his last name?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.045
‐Yep.
‐What's Dad's last name?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.380
Vandross.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.582
Dad's name is Luther Vandross?

11:55.616 --> 11:57.751
‐Are you messing with me?
‐No.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.453
‐Are you Irish?
‐Uh‐uh.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.221
‐What are you?
‐Dutch.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.056
‐What's Dad?
‐Dutch.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.192
Am I Dutch?!

12:05.225 --> 12:06.627
Yeah.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.096
No, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
slow down.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.199
Slow down, be serious, Mom,
be serious!

12:12.232 --> 12:15.335
Am I Irish?

12:16.637 --> 12:18.472
No.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.240
Please‐please tell me
th‐that's not true.

12:20.274 --> 12:22.776
Please tell me that I'm...

12:22.809 --> 12:24.778
No! No!

12:24.811 --> 12:26.380
You Dutch?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.315
No, th‐th‐there's
no way I'm Dutch.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.616
‐There's no way I'm...
‐

12:29.650 --> 12:32.019
You shush! You shush!

12:33.220 --> 12:35.722
Everybody was on the island
that weekend.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.457
Jizzaline...

12:37.491 --> 12:40.761
the‐the computer guy
with the little weird glasses?

12:40.794 --> 12:43.063
He didn't do anything
with the kids.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.232
But he was really
into the manatees.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.568
Which, by the way,
also got very sexual.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.203
Frank...

12:49.236 --> 12:50.604
can you, can you
just stop talking

12:50.637 --> 12:52.172
about sexual things
with manatees.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.208
The following year,
he doesn't show up,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.610
the manatee's
all bent out of shape.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.378
Frank, can you please stop?

12:58.412 --> 12:59.646
I‐I'm looking for someone

12:59.680 --> 13:01.515
and you're distracting me.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.084
I mean, this manatee was
so depressed,

13:04.117 --> 13:07.087
she actually swam
into a boat propeller.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.256
Boom! Blammo!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.258
Mantacide.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.393
The moral of the story is

13:13.427 --> 13:16.330
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.599
It was all consensual.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.667
Except for the kids,
thus the shredding.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.471
Wait, oh, Frank, Frank,
I've found her.

13:24.505 --> 13:27.508
‐Who?
‐The perfect woman
with the perfect

13:27.541 --> 13:30.210
head of Irish hair.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.446
What, what the hell,
what the hell is that?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.315
With the hair thing‐‐ what are
you, some kind of freak?

13:35.349 --> 13:37.518
Here's the thing.

13:37.551 --> 13:41.255
I've always noticed that
redheads have a distinct odor.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.657
A pleasant odor, to be clear.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.226
But, um, a peculiar scent

13:46.260 --> 13:48.395
that is quite different
than all other hair types.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.764
And I've always wondered,
like, is that a genetic thing?

13:50.797 --> 13:53.400
Or is it some sort of mutation
that sprung from generations

13:53.433 --> 13:56.069
of being away
from the motherland, so...

13:56.103 --> 13:59.039
I wanted to find a native with
an authentic head of Irish hair.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.175
And this little lass over there

14:01.208 --> 14:03.377
is the perfect specimen.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.046
‐Uh‐huh.
‐The perfect woman, I mean.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.514
Woman.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.049
She's the perfect woman.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.584
I'll be back.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.056
Hi, how are you?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.391
Lovely. How are you?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.126
I'm great, I'm great.
Are you from Ireland?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.460
How'd you guess?

14:20.494 --> 14:22.796
‐
‐Oi!

14:22.829 --> 14:25.732
‐Liar!
‐What the hell are you doing?

14:25.766 --> 14:28.335
What the hell are you doing?
You're not Irish.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.037
Or if you are,
that‐that's a wig.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.471
There's no smell at all to you.

14:31.505 --> 14:32.606
Am I to believe
that you're a natural redhead

14:32.639 --> 14:34.174
and yet there's no odor?

14:34.208 --> 14:36.476
No odor at all?
No, I don't believe you.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.246
Are you okay, hon?
You seem a little nutted.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.381
Oh, no, I'm fine.
If anyone's nutted, it's you.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.183
Okay, if "nutted" means
that you're a liar.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.185
‐Have you got a temp check yet?
‐What are you talk...?

14:45.219 --> 14:46.653
Don't‐don't point
that thing at me.

14:46.687 --> 14:48.188
Jesus. You have a fever.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.590
Okay, well, if I'm hot,

14:49.623 --> 14:52.059
it's only because you've
riled me up with your lies.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.595
My friend and I have traveled a
long way to this country and...

14:54.628 --> 14:57.064
‐Is that him?
‐Yeah.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.732
You can't dump
your rubbish in the beer!

14:58.765 --> 15:01.568
That's not rubbish,
it's, uh, shredded documents

15:01.602 --> 15:03.737
from a sex island, it's...
I'm not gonna explain it

15:03.770 --> 15:05.739
to you because, uh,
it sounds worse than it is.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.074
You need to leave!

15:07.107 --> 15:08.609
I'm going to leave.
I want to leave.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.611
I'm gonna go find
real Irish people,

15:10.644 --> 15:12.646
who have odors and don't
make people smell them,

15:12.679 --> 15:15.315
only to find out
that they have no odor at all!

15:15.349 --> 15:17.184
That's crazy!

15:17.217 --> 15:19.419
Good day to you.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.190
Hey, Frank,
we got to go, man, come on.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.592
We're getting kicked out.
Someone lied and I got angry.

15:25.626 --> 15:26.593
‐Oh.
‐

15:26.627 --> 15:28.195
Wait a minute.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.597
Hold on a second.

15:30.631 --> 15:33.200
‐Hey, Charlie!
‐Yo, Frank.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.068
Hey, man.
Can you come pick us up?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.703
We got booted out of the library
'cause Mac's freaking out.

15:36.737 --> 15:38.438
He just found out he's Dutch.

15:38.472 --> 15:40.607
Aw, that's gonna be
a whole thing.

15:40.641 --> 15:42.209
Oh, dude,
it's a whole thing already.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.477
He's being super annoying
about it.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.512
We just got tossed
out of this pub,

15:45.546 --> 15:47.714
because Dennis was smelling
somebody's hair.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.217
You can't smell something
that's got no odor, Frank.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.718
Oh, really?
Weird.

15:51.752 --> 15:53.587
Hey, look, dude, I found out

15:53.620 --> 15:55.589
I might have, like,
a half brother or something.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.658
So maybe we can, like, take this
trip out to the countryside?

15:57.691 --> 15:59.459
I'd really love
to meet up with this guy.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.628
A brother? That's weird.

16:01.662 --> 16:03.397
Well, the country sounds good.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.365
I can fold in
my shred‐and‐spread.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.201
Oh, you're doing
a shred‐and‐spread?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.036
We haven't done
one of those in years, man!

16:09.069 --> 16:10.704
I'm gonna kill myself, Frank.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.207
He's not really gonna do it,
dude, he's just being dramatic.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.342
‐Do it, bitch!
‐Yeah, do it, bitch.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.443
I'm not really gonna do it.
It's just a cry for help.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.712
Yeah, no shit! Just‐just
come pick us up, all right?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.781
All right, all right, goodbye!

16:20.814 --> 16:22.316
‐Wait, let me get this bag...
‐Let's go.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.650
Come on, let's get
this stuff out of here.

16:23.684 --> 16:25.118
This is ridiculous, man.
What are you doing?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.220
You're throwing it in a keg,
seriously?

16:26.253 --> 16:27.721
What, what are you gonna do?
I got to get rid of 'em.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.196
She has arrived, the obnoxious
American MILF is walking!

16:36.230 --> 16:38.332
The MILF is walking.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.034
‐You're two hours late.
‐Am I now? Oh, gosh. Well,

16:41.068 --> 16:43.170
I did get caught up in a little
bit of a shred‐and‐spread,

16:43.203 --> 16:44.505
plus it's hard to tell
with the time difference.

16:44.538 --> 16:46.573
Um, you can show me
to my trailer now.

16:46.607 --> 16:48.375
And I'd love a cup of coffee‐‐
two creams, please?

16:48.408 --> 16:49.610
‐Uh...
‐Holy shit.

16:49.643 --> 16:51.111
What?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.513
I am so confused.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.381
Is this more makeup?

16:56.283 --> 16:59.052
Oh, goddamn! I mean...

16:59.086 --> 17:02.456
Yeah, yeah, it looks
as though the makeup

17:02.489 --> 17:05.726
did redistribute down
into my, my eye area.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.327
I think just a quick touch‐up

17:07.361 --> 17:09.329
from a professional
would do the trick.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.131
Okay, ma'am, I don't know
what's going on with you,

17:11.164 --> 17:13.066
‐but please leave my set.
‐Hmm?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.768
No, no, no, no... no, come on.
Give me a chance, please.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.437
I can still be an obnoxious
American mom you'd like to F!

17:17.471 --> 17:19.206
Please, just give me a chance.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.675
I'm sorry,
we've already recast your part.

17:25.279 --> 17:26.647
You!

17:26.680 --> 17:28.448
Do you two know each other?

17:28.482 --> 17:31.318
‐What are you doing here?
‐What are you doing here?

17:31.351 --> 17:32.519
‐I asked you first!
‐Okay!

17:32.553 --> 17:34.588
I've just been
backpacking across Europe.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.256
About an hour ago,
some guy approached me,

17:36.290 --> 17:38.058
said I'd be perfect
for an obnoxious American MILF.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.526
Here I am.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.128
You don't know what you're
doing! You're not even an actor.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.729
‐Neither are you.
‐Oh, you bitch!

17:42.763 --> 17:44.731
‐Oh, you dumb bitch!
‐Okay.
‐Security!

17:44.765 --> 17:45.799
‐Get this woman off my set!
‐Don't you start!

17:45.832 --> 17:46.767
‐Security!
‐Don't you‐‐

17:46.800 --> 17:49.036
Come on, man!
Okay, okay, okay, it's fine!

17:49.069 --> 17:51.104
Okay, it's fine.
Everyone, listen, please.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.439
Please, please, I'm begging you.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.107
I'm begging you‐‐
I need this so bad!

17:54.141 --> 17:55.576
I need this worse

17:55.609 --> 17:57.311
than I've ever needed
anything in my entire life.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.579
Please give me a role, any role.

17:58.612 --> 18:01.348
A speaking role.
I'll say anything.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.719
I'll also do anything.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.454
That won't be necessary.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.456
Is it the black eyes, like...?

18:09.489 --> 18:10.624
Because I don't trade roles
for sex.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.259
Oh, goddamn feminists
ruin everything.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.527
‐Come on, man.
‐Okay, okay, okay.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.662
L‐Look, we're
casting for the role

18:15.696 --> 18:18.232
of "abused wife" for a scene
that shoots tomorrow.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.334
‐Huh?
‐It's only one line, but...

18:20.367 --> 18:22.336
I suppose given
your current face situation...

18:22.369 --> 18:24.605
Yes, I'll take it! I'll nail it!

18:24.638 --> 18:27.241
I'm gonna be fucking hilarious!
Oh, my God!

18:27.274 --> 18:29.476
You'll see,
you'll see how funny I am.

18:29.510 --> 18:31.311
‐The role is "abused wife."
‐Yeah.

18:31.345 --> 18:33.180
There's nothing funny about it.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.449
Oh, dramatic role.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.384
Even better.
That's where the awards are.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.753
Yeah, whatever. Just be here
tomorrow at 7:00 a. m.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.588
‐Okay, yep, yep. No, I won't.
‐And don't be late.

18:41.622 --> 18:44.191
Abused wife!
Is it Abused Wife Number One?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.461
Or‐‐ It doesn't matter.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna nail it.

18:48.629 --> 18:51.365
Well, gentlemen,
this driving experience has

18:51.398 --> 18:53.100
become much more charming
now that I've

18:53.133 --> 18:55.469
‐switched to driving
on the correct side of the road.
‐Huh?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.204
‐
‐See, the Irish are
so accommodating.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.640
They‐they don't want to drive
headfirst into a maniac.

18:59.673 --> 19:02.242
‐They will simply move
to avoid us.

19:02.276 --> 19:05.512
‐Uh‐huh.
‐

19:05.546 --> 19:07.781
Dude, are you sick?

19:07.814 --> 19:08.215
I'm not sick.

19:13.053 --> 19:15.422
I think I'm c‐co
robably thick
with, uh, petrol.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.090
He can't smell nothing.

19:17.124 --> 19:18.692
‐Plus he's got a fever.
‐What?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.561
Do you think you might
have COVID, dude?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.462
I‐I don't have COVID, okay?

19:22.496 --> 19:24.498
‐It's probably just, like,
allergies or something.
‐

19:24.531 --> 19:26.733
You know? Swerve, asshole!

19:26.767 --> 19:28.569
Do you want to collide
with an oncoming car?!

19:31.171 --> 19:33.574
Oh, my God, I'm on a call sheet!

19:33.607 --> 19:36.310
That's my name!
I can't believe this!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.579
I'm gonna be an abused wife!

19:38.612 --> 19:40.347
Oh!

19:40.380 --> 19:43.083
This is the greatest day
of my life‐‐ oh, shit!

19:43.116 --> 19:44.618
Got to look right
when you're in Ireland.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.020
‐That would've been stupid...
‐

19:48.589 --> 19:50.324
‐Oh!
‐Oh, shit!

19:50.357 --> 19:52.059
‐Oh, G...
‐No.

19:52.092 --> 19:53.493
‐That's not good.
‐Come on.

19:53.527 --> 19:56.196
‐Aw, man!
‐Oh, goddamn it, Dee!

19:56.230 --> 19:57.764
Why weren't you looking?

19:57.798 --> 20:00.200
‐Well, she looked right.
‐Well, you got
to look both ways.

20:00.234 --> 20:02.402
I mean,
that's standard shit, man.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.204
All right, well, don't yell
at her‐‐ she's unconscious.

20:04.238 --> 20:06.139
All right, you know
what, Frank, give her some stew.

20:06.173 --> 20:08.075
‐I finished the stew.
‐All right, uh, maybe

20:08.108 --> 20:10.010
breathe your stewy breath
in her face?

20:10.043 --> 20:12.145
Stew and stew breath
have never‐‐

20:13.614 --> 20:15.549
You definitely have COVID, man.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.185
You're the only one
that didn't get vaccinated.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.188
I'm fine, I'm fine. Now, we
told Dee that we were gonna

20:21.221 --> 20:23.056
pick her up from her acting gig,
and that's what we're gonna do.

20:23.090 --> 20:24.591
We're gonna,
we're gonna pick her up.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.560
Pick her up? I mean...

20:26.593 --> 20:28.695
she's all gangly
and then I'm gonna be crammed

20:28.729 --> 20:30.597
in the backseat
with an unconscious person.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.666
Like, is there
anything else we can do?

20:39.573 --> 20:41.441
All right, th‐this is
just gonna be much better,

20:41.475 --> 20:43.577
‐I think, you know?
‐We should've done this
from the very beginning.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.046
‐Yeah!
‐Guys, I think
we're finally on vacation.
