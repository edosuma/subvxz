the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.573 --> 00:08.382
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.354
These are their stories.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.009
You hardly been here a half hour.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.774
Yeah, well, now I got a half hour
drive back home

00:34.801 --> 00:36.838
before Denise wakes up.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.215
What, her sleeping pills no good anymore?

00:42.409 --> 00:44.184
( snorts )

00:44.711 --> 00:46.713
Come on, baby.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.694
Just hold me.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.195
Come on.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.892
Angie, you know how I feel about you.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.664
I'll call you when I call you.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.532
Henry, wake up.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.178
I need you right now in the kitchen.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.316
Henry, come on, answer me. I mean it.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.883
- What?
- What is that?

01:23.216 --> 01:25.423
It's a condom, Henry. A used condom.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.796
What's it doing on my floor?

01:31.358 --> 01:33.668
Those damn bastards.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.265
God! The parking lot guys.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.106
Last night, at Kray's.
I went there with a client.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.476
What are you talking about?

01:41.501 --> 01:44.209
One of them must've brought
his girlfriend into the car,

01:44.237 --> 01:46.740
and the son of a bitch just threw it,

01:46.773 --> 01:48.719
just left it there on the ground.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.380
And then I get in, you know,
and I step on it,

01:50.410 --> 01:54.153
and it sticks to my shoe,
and then I drag it in here.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.161
Oh...

01:56.183 --> 01:58.129
I'm so sorry.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.234
Oh, sweetheart.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.306
You should just stop taking
clients there.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.899
That'll send them a message.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.172
That is exactly what I'm going to do.

02:15.168 --> 02:18.206
You should make them pay
to clean your car.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.842
I know.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.315
All right, what's the line
on Purdue-Michigan?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.327
Give me a dime on Michigan.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.522
- (knocking)
- Right. I got to go.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.666
Come!

02:34.688 --> 02:38.158
You settled the Kendricks case for 75 grand?!

02:38.191 --> 02:40.102
You could've gotten twice that much.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.903
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did. You didn't answer my pages.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.466
Is that the story you're going to
go with? You see this ring?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.638
Yale Law. Right?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.614
You think they just give these out to idiots?

02:49.636 --> 02:52.640
If I hadn't settled, they might've
actually read the medical report.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.882
Your chiropractor had Mrs.
Kendricks' injury on the wrong shoulder.

02:55.909 --> 02:59.880
- 75 grand was a gift.
- All right, well just check
with me next time.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.551
There's not going to be a next time.

03:01.581 --> 03:04.494
- Mullins and Koop has offered me a position.
- (phone ringing)

03:04.518 --> 03:06.464
Things've been slow around here anyway.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.898
(ringing continuing)

03:10.691 --> 03:12.967
Yeah? Hey, what's going on?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.099
Tonight? No, Angie, I can't tonight.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.769
Because I have a job, that's why.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.972
Okay, okay, okay.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.174
But I can't stay for long.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.647
What? What?

03:30.677 --> 03:33.658
Oh, Angie, I don't have time for this.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.490
- I want to help you relax.
- I'm not in the mood.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.996
You know, Denise nearly caught me last night.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.054
You made me so crazy,

03:40.087 --> 03:41.828
I forgot to take off the damn condom.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.335
It fell out of my pants on the kitchen floor.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.837
Well, we don't have to have sex.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.999
We can just chill out, you know.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.236
- Talk and stuff.
- I can't.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.177
- Not now.
- Well then, when?

03:54.201 --> 03:56.010
3:00 in the morning?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.346
Slam, bang, like I'm some whore?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.180
Angie.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.677
Why can't we just hang out
like a regular couple?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.553
'Cause we're not a regular couple!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.115
We have structure.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.959
- That's the way it has to be.
- Well, screw your structure.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.827
I ain't with it no more.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.093
I want you to leave your wife.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.899
Are you nuts? I'm not leaving Denise.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.032
- You said you were going to take care of me!
- Oh, just take it easy.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.607
You're wife's going to leave you!

04:26.633 --> 04:28.306
- I'm going to call her.
- Don't you dare.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.838
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Don't you dare.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.708
- ( screams )
- ( grunting )

04:47.320 --> 04:50.358
I'm going away for two weeks,
and you've hardly said boo to me.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.269
Stuff's piling up at work.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.172
Are you sure it isn't anything else?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.005
Marie, it's nothing.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.635
Henry, I'm sick of traveling.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.613
I want to be one place.
I want to be with you.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.951
We're good together, aren't we?

05:06.973 --> 05:10.614
I can make you happy. Better than Denise.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.389
Let me think about it.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.899
I’m serious.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.163
I'd do anything to be with you.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.504
I know. Let's skip dessert.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.974
My plane's not till midnight.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.138
We'll get a room near the airport.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.810
Marie, I just want to spend
some time alone... with you.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.344
Two weeks is-- it's just too long
to be away from you, baby.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.351
( theme music playing )

06:32.492 --> 06:35.962
Decedent's Angie Suarez, 24. Lives alone.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.909
No known husband, boyfriend or girlfriend.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.309
Prostitution raps?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.040
She doesn't have a record, period.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.070
Neighbors didn't notice anything.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.981
She have any friends in the building?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.486
No special friend.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.318
General impression is people liked her.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.824
She's just a tiny little thing.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.350
It took a real tough guy to kill her.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.296
Yeah.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.765
Tough guy she liked a lot.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.426
She did her nails,

07:03.456 --> 07:08.098
lipstick, make-up, silk lingerie.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.472
Not cheap for a girl like her.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.975
Scented bath oil.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.805
This was going to be a big date.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.615
I was bringing her some pie my wife made.

07:22.642 --> 07:26.784
Angie was nice to her when I
was in the hospital last fall.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.293
Man, it's an awful thing.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.125
She ever talk about boyfriends?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.631
No. She talked about
her family back in Miami,

07:33.653 --> 07:35.633
about trying to better herself.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.998
How was she doing with that?

07:37.023 --> 07:40.664
- Not too good with the hours she was keeping.
- What hours were those?

07:40.694 --> 07:43.265
Every night around 8:00,
a van would pick her up,

07:43.296 --> 07:44.604
and there would be a driver

07:44.631 --> 07:47.134
with six or seven young Hispanic girls,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.477
all dressed up and looking fine.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.005
She wouldn't get home till 2:00 or 3:00.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.576
- You waited up?
- We'd hear her in the hallway
singing to herself

07:55.608 --> 07:57.986
like she had a couple of drinks too many.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.617
But she always came home alone.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.627
All right. Thank you.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.924
There are hostess bars over in Queens,

08:05.952 --> 08:09.092
cater to a Spanish clientele,
mostly undocumented workers.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.124
They pick up their girls in a van.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.332
Angie works here since last year.
She's a good employee.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.640
She's good at playing
these guys for their money.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.203
You want the girls to talk to you,
you gotta buy them drinks.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.875
Everybody knows the game.
She hasn't been here for a few days.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.248
Because she was strangled
and drowned in her bathtub.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.981
Little Angie?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.686
- No.
- Anyone here good for it?

08:34.714 --> 08:37.592
No. The customers don't know
where they live.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.688
Maybe she was seeing one of them on the side.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.289
House rules. No sex, no dating.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.700
Just talking and dancing.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.795
Dead?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.774
Madre de Dios.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.367
It was someone she knew well.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.278
Maybe someone from here.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.542
Sorry, mister, I have to work.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.881
I can't sit and talk to you.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.510
Let's dance.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.624
I like to dance.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.799
Is that better?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.773
Angie like to dance?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.368
She loved it.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.606
But she don't like this place.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.478
You have to drink to make money,

09:30.503 --> 09:32.779
and she don't like drinking.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.980
And Mr. Casamayor,
he don't treat her so nice.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.081
How's that?

09:40.113 --> 09:43.856
She broke her foot on the stairs
in the subway, and she can't walk,

09:43.883 --> 09:47.160
and he said if she don't come
to work anyway, he going to fire her.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.996
Nice boss.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.464
How about the customers?

09:53.493 --> 09:55.473
Is anyone special?

09:55.495 --> 09:58.806
No, she treat them all the same.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.005
Anyway, she have a boyfriend.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.112
- Who's that?
- I don't know. An Anglo.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.644
She say one day she gonna be with him.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.520
She don't have to work like this no more.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.022
- Thank you, Tia, okay?
- Yeah.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.835
This is for the drinks and for the dance.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.666
Thank you.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.333
No Anglo boyfriends on here.
What about her apartment?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.841
Nothing.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.811
The guy got rid of anything that
might've had his name or number.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.679
- He leave any other calling card?
- Looks like he wiped his
fingerprints off doorknobs,

10:37.704 --> 10:40.184
that sort of thing. No signs of sex.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.345
We got coke residue on a
mirror in the bedroom.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.685
But Angie's tox was negative for drugs.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.692
So we feel pretty good
she wasn't killed by a stranger?

10:47.714 --> 10:49.591
She knew the guy. Good.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.758
Councilman'll be delighted to know it's
not some maniac terrorizing his slum.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.368
You can kick it over to the 1-5.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.529
Why? We got time for this.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.004
Chief of detectives...

11:01.027 --> 11:03.974
Needs a couple of bodies
for the Mayor's Drug Task Force.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.968
Okay, I should know better.
But it's a good opportunity.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.311
Suit yourself.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.476
- You like this case, too.
- Yeah, I like Angie.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.885
The captain's right, the task force
is a good way for you to get noticed.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.356
I didn't take this job to get noticed.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.652
All right, this came in 20 minutes ago.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.629
Female Caucasian, young, blonde,
found nude on Rockaway Beach.

11:25.652 --> 11:28.792
Possible drowning or strangulation.
Five feet tall, slim build.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.391
Big day for little women.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.903
A couple of surfers found her right here.

11:34.928 --> 11:38.273
- Tide's been running high in the last
couple of days?
- About four feet.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.074
- How do you explain she got all
the way up here?
- I don't.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.205
But her lungs are full of water
She drowned

11:43.236 --> 11:45.773
probably after being assaulted
and tossed off a boat.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.684
She's been dead at least a couple of days.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.019
Well, unless they're scenting
the ocean with lavender,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.889
this woman was drowned in a bathtub.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.266
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

12:07.260 --> 12:10.764
Denise, you nearly gave me a heart attack.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.799
What are those?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.312
This is evidence in a case.

12:15.335 --> 12:19.977
This woman got her jacket caught
in a door getting off a bus.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.816
Nearly dragged her half-way down the block.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.981
It sounds like a good case.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.117
Well, might only be worth 15
or 20 grand to the firm.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.653
But the bus company's
really going to make me work for it.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.825
Is everything okay at the firm?

12:35.855 --> 12:38.495
Yeah, on paper, on paper.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.835
It just takes longer and longer
to get the cases settled.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.933
- You need help?
- Oh, Denise.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.671
I know you hate to ask.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.441
I'll talk to Tom at the bank.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.708
Honey.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.048
What would I do without you?

13:04.817 --> 13:07.491
Hand prints around her neck
are similar in size and range

13:07.520 --> 13:09.295
as the ones on Ms. Suarez.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.962
Tox screen was positive
for cocaine and alcohol.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.904
Stomach was full. Clams
casino'd be my guess,

13:14.927 --> 13:17.407
indicating she was killed
about an hour after eating.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.807
- Sexual assault?
- No.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.971
- Negative for all three ports of entry.
- She looks athletic.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.811
Well-developed arms and legs,
stomach like a trampoline,

13:24.837 --> 13:26.976
a tush you could crack walnuts with,

13:27.006 --> 13:28.986
and an excellent body wax,

13:29.008 --> 13:32.182
except of course for the exclamation point.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.817
She could be a stripper...?

13:34.847 --> 13:39.489
These scars on her back, about 6 months old.
Look like glass cuts.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.692
Maybe she fell through
a shower door or a window.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.827
And Angie Suarez broke
her foot eight months ago.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.066
What's this guy's twist
besides picking on petite women?

13:48.094 --> 13:50.836
Neither victim showed
any signs of sexual contact.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.639
No sign the perp gratified himself
on or near the bodies.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.373
But we've got a serial killer, right?

13:55.401 --> 13:58.177
Well, there's a...

13:58.204 --> 14:00.445
Ritualistic aspect to the killings.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.612
Bathtub, similar body types.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.919
But there's no extraneous violence
pre or postmortem.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.449
The murders were committed
within a day or two of each other.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.395
It could be a serial killer
or a killing spree.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.398
(phone ringing)

14:14.420 --> 14:16.627
Deakins. Uh-huh.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.466
Okay. Got it.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.337
Well, whatever they are...

14:23.496 --> 14:25.066
Now there's three of 'em.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.712
Hand prints look the same size
as the other ones.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.777
Same body type. No drowning.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.981
This one was strangled right here.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.756
This is a toe separator for a bunion...

14:47.787 --> 14:49.858
When she runs. She was jogging.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.301
Abrasions on her hands
and knees from the fall.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.965
She was probably attacked
from behind on the path.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.975
The foot's swelled. Feels cracked.

14:57.997 --> 15:01.740
More likely the guy was running
next to her and tripped her.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.509
As if by accident.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.309
There are no drag marks,

15:09.342 --> 15:11.652
so she probably hopped over here

15:11.677 --> 15:14.749
under her own steam or with his help.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.818
Then he went to work on her.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.956
Somebody she knew.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.262
Someone she felt safe with.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.302
None of the witnesses saw her this morning,

15:25.324 --> 15:27.531
but they said she jogged
most days, always alone.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.564
- What do you hear from the precincts?
- No open cases with similar MOS.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.634
We got a pop on the jogger's prints.
Deirdre Carnahan, 33.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.838
She has priors?

15:34.867 --> 15:37.370
Her prints are in the system
because she's a city employee.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.610
- Court clerk's office.
- Civil Court?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.414
Yes.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.924
I'm looking for Angie Suarez's
phone-- phone records.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.895
We have a woman who worked in Civil Court
where personal injury lawsuits are filed.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.057
We have a Jane Doe with a broken wrist

15:54.086 --> 15:57.067
and glass cuts on her back,
probably from an accident.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.091
And we have Angie Suarez...

16:02.128 --> 16:04.938
Who was calling the law firm
of Henry Talbott every other day

16:04.964 --> 16:08.070
since she broke her foot in a slip-and-fall.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.111
Yes, Ms. Suarez was a client of ours.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.414
She was suing the city.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.285
She'd call every so often and ask about it.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.622
- She was very impatient.
- Who was handling her case?

16:21.647 --> 16:24.594
- An associate, Rand Bowers.
- What about this woman?

16:24.617 --> 16:27.427
She had a broken wrist,
glass cuts on her back.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.525
Marie Rimer. She was suing a strip club.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.264
A mirror fell on her when she was
doing a lap dance.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.533
Rand Bowers was handling this case as well.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.508
- Can we speak to Mr. Bowers?
- He doesn't work here anymore.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.839
( knocking )

16:40.833 --> 16:42.972
Anything I can help here with, Anna?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.812
These detectives are asking
about two of our clients,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.148
Angie Suarez and Marie Rimer.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.484
- And why's that?
- They were found murdered.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.491
- Are you Henry Talbott?
- Yeah.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.222
Jeez. What happened?

16:59.519 --> 17:02.056
Maybe we should talk about it in your office.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.797
That's a freak thing,
losing two clients like that.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.166
I guess I’m not surprised. If I remember,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.506
they were employed in marginal lines of work.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.173
- That's right. You're not that involved
in their cases.
- I sign clients.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.273
I hand them off to my associate...

17:19.305 --> 17:21.615
And write them a check at the end of the day.

17:21.641 --> 17:25.953
Delegation. Is that the secret
to success you learned at Yale?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.259
- Your ring.
- Oh.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.127
It's one of my secrets.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.463
What was Rand Bowers' relationship with
Ms. Suarez and Ms. Rimer?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.628
I don't know.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.264
Do you think something
improper was going on?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.137
He knew all the victims.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.836
Another woman was killed with the same MO.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.471
Deirdre Carnahan,
from the court clerk's office.

17:48.501 --> 17:52.108
Her colleagues said she knew Mr. Bowers
from when he came in to file lawsuits.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.813
I should tell you, I fired
Rand Bowers last Monday.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.447
- For what reason?
- His work was erratic.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.718
He wasn't getting his cases settled,

18:00.746 --> 18:03.784
and I don't know if it was the job
or his personal life,

18:03.816 --> 18:06.592
but he seemed like he
was just spinning out of control.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.257
Schultz & Moynahan.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.269
It's a golf tournament.
You used to work there?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.771
Yeah, I was senior partner.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.899
Too much management, not enough law.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.273
Nothing beats flying solo.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.936
( chuckles )

18:20.967 --> 18:22.947
I see you like college hoops.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.677
You have a few games circled here.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.152
I follow the teams.

18:30.142 --> 18:33.351
( laughs ) No, it's all right.
We're not Vice Squad.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.916
(nervous laugh) Okay. Scared me.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.454
Got to do something to relieve the stress.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.631
I'm sure you do.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.664
(phone ringing)

18:49.996 --> 18:52.704
Is that a private line?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.336
It's my wife.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.176
(ringing continues)

18:58.204 --> 19:01.651
- Don't mind us.
- Actually, I do.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.017
Why don't you just...

19:03.042 --> 19:05.249
Leave your name with my secretary,

19:05.277 --> 19:08.451
and if I think of something,
I'll give you a call.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.088
Yeah.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.397
Connecticut? Connecticut is gross.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.733
You've been bugging me
to take you away for the weekend.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.434
- I'm taking you to Connecticut.
- I told you, I want Miami, South Beach.

19:23.462 --> 19:27.137
This time of year? it's like a damned sauna.
You'll like Connecticut.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.907
- It's got a casino.
- ( snorts )

19:28.934 --> 19:31.278
There's no sandy beach there.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.182
Please, Henry, I got beautiful
bikini to wear

19:34.206 --> 19:37.449
with little string go up between here.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.979
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
wear it in the hotel room?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.049
I want to feel the sun on my skin.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.528
You promise me Miami.
You promise we go away for a month.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.498
- I have a law firm to run.
- I think you have other girl.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.934
I think you have wife. I will find out.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.465
Baby, there's no one.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.004
Look...

20:02.668 --> 20:04.477
Just give me this weekend,

20:04.503 --> 20:06.676
and we'll go to Miami for Labor Day.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.482
- Better be not promise.
- Don't worry...

20:09.508 --> 20:11.351
No promise.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.692
Talbott can say whatever he wants,
but he did not fire me.

20:16.716 --> 20:21.096
We're more interested in what
you have to say about him,

20:21.120 --> 20:24.590
starting with the $60,000
settlement to Angie Suarez.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.661
- I don't know anything about it.
- Talbott said the case was never settled.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.173
He said the same thing about Marie Rimer.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.176
The strip club's insurance company

20:32.198 --> 20:34.804
say they wrote a check out for $150,000.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.805
Talbott handled the clients' money, not me.
Ask Suarez and Rimer.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.341
It'll have to come from you, Rand,

20:41.373 --> 20:43.819
because they're dead.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.384
Oh my God.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.225
Oh, that crazy son of a bitch.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.755
Uh, Talbott?

20:54.787 --> 20:56.994
He told me not to tell them
about the settlements.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.128
He said he was keeping the money.
He was investing it or some bull.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.139
I think he was having affairs
with them.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.641
He had them all on speed dial
on his office phone.

21:04.663 --> 21:08.076
- The guy had needs.
- Like gambling?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.013
And coke. He had drawer full of cash
he'd give his secretary

21:11.036 --> 21:13.448
to run errands to his coke dealer;
his bookie.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.884
It's what got him tossed out
of Schultz & Moynahan.

21:15.908 --> 21:19.151
- How does he stay in business?
- Mostly his wife bailed him out.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.180
She's got family money. A lot of it.

21:21.213 --> 21:24.490
Looks like his train's about
to run out of gravy.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.997
( knocking )

21:32.024 --> 21:34.664
Mrs. Talbott, is your husband home?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.673
No, he's away working.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.675
He already left for his office?

21:38.697 --> 21:42.167
No, I meant he's in Pittsburgh
on business until Monday.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.648
- He drove himself to the airport last night.
- Mom, what's going on?

21:45.671 --> 21:49.346
- Go back inside. It's okay. Go.
- Where in Pittsburgh?

21:49.375 --> 21:51.753
He didn't tell me.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.984
I have no idea. What's going on?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.890
We're sorry, but we have a search warrant

21:55.915 --> 21:57.724
and an arrest warrant for your husband.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.230
- Arrest for what?
- Three murders.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.030
Henry never hurt anyone his whole life.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.474
He's never so much as raised his voice at me.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.478
I'm sure that's true, Mrs. Talbott,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.138
but we still need to find him.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.478
I told you, I don't know where he is.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.814
Well, doesn't he have a cell phone?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.649
He turns it off when he's working.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.882
We checked last night's
flights to Pittsburgh

22:24.910 --> 22:26.821
from LaGuardia, Newark, JFK.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.723
Your husband wasn't on any of them.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.727
No. He went to Pittsburgh.

22:30.749 --> 22:34.720
This is Angie Suarez.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.030
She worked in a hostess ban

22:38.057 --> 22:41.561
She was killed Monday by somebody she knew.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.370
She was your husband's client...

22:45.898 --> 22:47.878
And his mistress.

22:48.868 --> 22:53.180
- And he stole $60,000 from her.
- That's not true.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.049
Marie Rimer. She was a stripper.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.056
She was killed Monday or Tuesday

22:59.078 --> 23:01.251
in the same way as Ms. Suarez.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.319
She was also a client, and he slept
with her and stole her money.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.295
Deirdre Carnahan.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.232
She worked in the court clerk's office.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.136
She was another one
of your husband's mistresses.

23:14.159 --> 23:17.140
By the way, he jogs
in the morning, doesn't he?

23:17.162 --> 23:19.472
- Yes.
- Thursday?

23:19.498 --> 23:21.500
I guess. I'm not sure.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.444
Deirdre Carnahan was killed

23:25.471 --> 23:29.078
by someone she was jogging with Thursday.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.419
All these women were killed
by the same man,

23:32.444 --> 23:34.754
the same man they were all sleeping with.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.384
Your husband.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.938
Is something wrong with the floor?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.469
No.

23:56.502 --> 23:59.346
You were remembering something?

23:59.371 --> 24:01.544
No, I was just thinking.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.346
You're completely wrong about Henry.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.721
- He's deceiving you!
- No.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.226
He's my husband. I'm calling my lawyer.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.422
We'll just see how far you get with this.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.025
Talbott knows how to pick them.

24:31.670 --> 24:35.140
There is-- there is one guy
Talbott would stay in touch with.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.881
His bookie.

24:40.512 --> 24:43.118
I don't know anything about bookmaking.

24:43.148 --> 24:46.391
I own a diner. That's my business.

24:46.418 --> 24:50.161
Those envelopes Talbott's secretary brings
you-- what are those, lunch orders?

24:50.189 --> 24:53.568
Mr. Turman, Henry Talbott is a suspect
in the murder of three women.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.002
What do you want me to do about it?

25:00.032 --> 25:02.672
It's late Friday.
There's lots of games on the schedule.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.204
He's going to call in.
We want to put a trace on him.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.753
This is something you want
to help us with, right?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.749
He already called.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.283
- About an hour ago.
- Where was he?

25:17.316 --> 25:19.626
Caller ID had a Connecticut area code.

25:19.651 --> 25:22.598
Sounded like he was at a gas station.
There was a girl with him.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.261
Sounded like a Russian girl.
You guys think he's running?

25:25.290 --> 25:28.328
- Why? How much is he down?
- 120 Gs.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.362
No Russian names among his clients.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.342
Maybe his phone records. You calling in?

25:32.364 --> 25:35.504
Yeah. I'm going to get out notification
to the Connecticut State Troopers.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.514
I'm worried for this girl, whoever she is.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.914
- If she says the wrong thing--
- It may not matter.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.281
Whatever set Talbott off--

25:41.306 --> 25:43.752
maybe one of the girls
threatened to expose him.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.586
He was going to get disbarred,
lose his wife.

25:46.612 --> 25:50.389
He went into panic mode.
Yeah, hook me up to Operations.

25:50.416 --> 25:54.455
Here. Calls to the Mikhailkov
Chiropractic Clinic.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.090
I smell blinis.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.000
The clinic had one of their therapists

26:00.025 --> 26:02.972
spending the weekend in Connecticut
with some mystery boyfriend.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.703
It's her. Irina Konchalovsky.
Troopers found her naked

26:05.731 --> 26:08.541
in a rest stop off I-95
outside of Bridgeport.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.047
The strangulation marks
are probably from a belt.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.778
4 girls in a week. That
guy's cleaning house.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.945
Forensics examined Talbott's office phone.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.954
His speed dial had room for eight numbers.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.957
Two slots were for his wife's numbers,
another slot was his bookie,

26:20.979 --> 26:23.789
5 other slots had their numbers erased.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.160
5 girlfriends. There's one still out there.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.496
- Any way to recover those numbers?
- Once they're gone, they're gone.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.593
But there was a message on his voice mail.
No way to tell how old it is.

26:32.624 --> 26:33.967
I transferred it to tape.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.063
It's me! I'm so sorry, baby,

26:36.095 --> 26:38.735
but I’ll be tied up in report
until 9:00 tonight.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.973
Nothing I can do about it.
I’ll make it up to you.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.640
"In report." That's a hospital
nurse's meeting.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.549
- Our 5th girlfriend's a nurse.
- Check his phone records.

26:47.573 --> 26:50.952
I don't remember any nurses, but there
are calls to a half dozen hospitals.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.048
Better get started.
Let's not let this one get away.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.719
Maybe there's a way we could reel Talbott in.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.160
What about between shifts?
Can't we get together?

26:59.184 --> 27:01.630
- I'm on call. I have to sleep here.
- Damn it.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.599
Damn it. Well, when can I see you?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.795
- Wednesday night.
- That's two days.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.430
I know, baby.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.871
Well, just screw it.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.966
- Come-- come away with me now.
- I can't.

27:11.997 --> 27:13.943
I want to so much, baby. I want you.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.675
Look, Dana, I want to stay at your place.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.309
Of course. Did something happen with Denise?

27:20.339 --> 27:21.613
I left her.

27:23.342 --> 27:27.290
Henry, you make yourself
at home for as long as you want.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.485
I got to go. I'll see you Wednesday.

27:33.919 --> 27:36.923
I hear disturbing things about you, Henry,

27:36.955 --> 27:39.561
but your business is your business.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.434
I need you to settle up.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.464
The full 120.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.136
I know you check your messages, Henry.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.578
If I don't hear from you within 24 hours,

27:49.601 --> 27:52.309
my associates'll find you.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.578
There's no second chance on this, Henry.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.018
You got my number. Call me.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.420
- How was that?
- That was pretty good.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.403
What took you so long? You got the money?

28:14.426 --> 28:16.872
- I was just getting ready to leave.
- (sirens blaring )

28:16.895 --> 28:19.205
Freeze! Don't move!

28:23.302 --> 28:25.077
All right, cuff him!

28:36.982 --> 28:39.792
He called and asked me to help him
with his gambling debt.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.321
- Of course I agreed.
- Why couldn't he do it himself?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.391
He's out of town on business. I told you.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.731
We know he's out of town.

28:45.757 --> 28:48.636
Want to see what "business"
he was up to this weekend?

28:48.660 --> 28:52.130
This girl was a therapist at a clinic

28:52.164 --> 28:54.303
that treated your husband's clients.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.474
- It won't end with her.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.

28:58.503 --> 29:02.041
Since there aren't any charges pending,
I'm walking my client out of here.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.055
Where you going, Mrs. Talbott?
You going to anesthetize yourself

29:05.077 --> 29:07.523
with these pills we found
in your purse and your house?

29:07.546 --> 29:11.255
What do you got there? Sedatives,
sleeping pills, anti-depressants--

29:11.283 --> 29:13.820
I have a medical condition.
My doctor prescribed them.

29:13.852 --> 29:17.129
There's no prescription number on these.
You got these under the table.

29:17.155 --> 29:19.601
The only medical condition
you have is denial.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.367
- Detective!
- Your husband got them for you, didn't he,

29:22.394 --> 29:26.433
from one of his connections?
To help you blot out what you know.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.844
- I don't know anything.
- You know!

29:29.868 --> 29:33.816
Our lab analyzed that spot
on your kitchen floor.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.183
You know, the one that you were staring at?

29:36.208 --> 29:39.189
They found traces of semen and spermicide.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.952
What happened?

29:40.979 --> 29:45.052
Did Henry nail one of his girlfriends
on your shiny floor?!

29:45.083 --> 29:46.994
Did he leave something there for you

29:47.019 --> 29:49.795
to flaunt how little he cares for you?!

29:49.821 --> 29:51.232
Henry cares about me.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.665
Not you. Your money.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.641
Me. He loves me.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.803
Don't you get it?

30:00.832 --> 30:03.142
Even if what you say is true, which it isn't,

30:03.168 --> 30:06.115
if he killed them, he did it for me.
To be with me.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.140
- Denise.
- Henry loves me.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.088
No one's keeping him away
from me or my children.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.702
So much for sisterhood.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.173
She knows something.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.766
It's just a matter
of pushing the right button.

30:38.036 --> 30:41.813
Doctors usually only keep pill samples

30:41.840 --> 30:43.751
in their offices.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.189
Bottles like these--

30:47.212 --> 30:50.125
what, Talbott, got them from
a friendly pharmacist?

30:50.148 --> 30:53.254
Or a very friendly nurse at a hospital.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.466
Those lot numbers are correct.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.470
The bottles did come from our dispensary,

31:00.492 --> 31:02.802
but I can't imagine one
of my nurses stealing.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.968
She would've been pressured
into it by her boyfriend,

31:05.997 --> 31:08.238
- Henry Talbott.
- Have you seen him?

31:08.266 --> 31:10.644
- He's a lawyer.
- Oh, yes.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.649
Every six months he comes around,

31:12.671 --> 31:15.311
hands out his business card
fishing for referrals.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.378
But I don't know if he has
a relationship with anybody here.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.391
He tends to favor petite women
in their 20's or 30's.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.222
That describes a lot of my nurses.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.353
We'd like to show his picture around.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.331
And we need a list of your off-duty nurses.

31:28.353 --> 31:31.163
I'm on my way out right now.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

31:31.189 --> 31:33.169
What kind of surprise?

31:33.191 --> 31:36.001
A bath? Sounds so sensual.

31:36.027 --> 31:38.029
I'll be there as quick as I can.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.076
We just wanted to make sure you were safe.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.174
Thank you.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.344
Off-duty personnel accounted for.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.513
One thing you can say in Talbott's favor--

31:51.543 --> 31:53.614
he's an equal opportunity sleazeball.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.181
I'm going home and put my feet up.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.783
- See ya Friday, Artie.
- See ya.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.817
I didn't talk to her.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.261
- (sniffing)
- Ahh.

32:19.337 --> 32:20.975
(sighs)

32:21.006 --> 32:23.008
( knocking )

32:33.351 --> 32:36.025
Hey, Don Juan, you're under arrest.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.858
Let me make sure I haven't
missed anything.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.636
There's no physical evidence
of any kind

32:44.663 --> 32:47.109
at the crime scene or in his car.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.506
There's no fingerprints, no fibers,

32:50.535 --> 32:54.506
no witnesses to connect Mr. Talbott
to any of the bodies.

32:55.373 --> 32:59.321
There's no evidence of contact
between Mr. Talbott and any of these girls

32:59.344 --> 33:03.156
that cannot be explained away
by a professional relationship.

33:03.181 --> 33:04.956
We have the kid who used to work for him.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.487
Besides the fact his own conduct
is questionable, he can offer no evidence

33:08.520 --> 33:11.990
that Talbott was sleeping with the victims,
let alone murdered them.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.594
We know he defrauded two of them.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.038
However satisfying that knowledge is,

33:17.062 --> 33:19.133
it doesn't amount to a prosecutable case.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.576
The only charges we can make stick

33:21.600 --> 33:24.945
are gambling and possession of cocaine.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
He needs to be caught in the act.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.616
And maybe he can be,

33:34.613 --> 33:36.889
given the right stimulus.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.843
So what happens now?

33:57.869 --> 34:00.179
Now I fill out the booking form.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.048
I need your date of birth.

34:02.073 --> 34:04.917
February 17th, 1957.

34:04.943 --> 34:06.820
I never would've guessed you're over 40.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.485
- Really? Why is that?
- Place of birth?

34:09.514 --> 34:12.154
Queens. St. Mark's Hospital.

34:12.183 --> 34:13.719
I think I know why.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.130
It's because I have a lot of girlfriends
for a guy my age. Is that right?

34:18.523 --> 34:21.197
Maybe it's true. But you ask them.
They'll tell you.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.603
I could never hurt a woman.

34:22.627 --> 34:24.402
It's just-- it's not my nature.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.100
You know,

34:29.134 --> 34:31.512
you should sit up more when you type.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.176
It's bad for your back and your shoulders.

34:34.205 --> 34:38.085
- Think so?
- I've done a lot of repetitive motion cases.

34:38.109 --> 34:41.283
No, more, more.
Straighten your shoulders back there.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.918
Like that, yeah, good.
It feels better though, right?

34:43.949 --> 34:47.418
- I need him in interrogation.
- I'm not done booking him.

34:47.452 --> 34:51.491
-I don't care, I need him in
interrogation now.
- Hey, lay off.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.969
- Hey, it's none of your business.
- Ooh, tough guy.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.505
Stand back from the door.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.946
Well, we're here. Where's he?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.783
He likes to take his time.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.301
I appreciate what you said back there.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.803
I see that kind of stuff all the time.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.534
They do it because they know
they can get away with it.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.835
But I'm not telling you
anything you don't already know.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.709
You're not wearing a wedding ring.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.909
Is that for professional reasons
or 'cause you're single?

35:39.938 --> 35:43.784
I'm single. Very single right now.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.949
I'll bet when guys find out you're a cop,

35:47.979 --> 35:49.720
they don't know how to handle it.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.625
They feel threatened.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.597
They leave you alone
or they try to push you around.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.496
( laughs )

35:56.521 --> 36:00.333
Sounds like every Saturday night
I've had for the last year.

36:00.358 --> 36:04.238
- How do you know so much?
- Because I listen to women.

36:04.262 --> 36:07.971
Is that how you keep all those
women happy, by listening to them?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.945
I listen when they tell me what they like,

36:09.968 --> 36:11.606
what they want.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.445
And then I give it to them.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.312
I have a lot to give the right woman.

36:23.314 --> 36:25.294
I'm going to walk out of here.

36:25.316 --> 36:28.627
And when it's appropriate,
I'd like to call you.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.690
If it's okay with you.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.668
Let's just see what happens here.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.870
Nothing's going to happen.

36:42.901 --> 36:46.348
Just tell me you'll think about it.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.779
- I'll think about it.
- Doesn't have to be anything.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.086
Just a drink. I'm a good listener.

36:54.112 --> 36:57.218
- Stop it.
- You know, you have beautiful hair.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.270
You really believe

37:07.292 --> 37:09.431
if he comes home

37:09.461 --> 37:11.839
that he's going to be a good boy?

37:13.798 --> 37:15.607
Look at him.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.443
His facing four murder charges,

37:18.470 --> 37:21.314
and he still can't help himself

37:21.339 --> 37:22.943
Look how cocky he is.

37:25.410 --> 37:29.290
It’s because he knows
that he has you in his back pocket.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.955
You hoped he'd change.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.829
He-- he won't.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.133
It's the way his brain is wired.

37:44.162 --> 37:47.143
He’s never been the man
you thought you married.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.677
He never will be.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.981
( sobs )

38:05.450 --> 38:07.828
One night, two weeks ago,

38:07.852 --> 38:09.729
I found him in the garage.

38:09.754 --> 38:12.132
He was taking clothes out
of the trunk of his car--

38:12.157 --> 38:14.103
women's clothes.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.934
A white jacket, a red blouse.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.304
He put them in a garbage bag.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.444
It was a great piano ban it was very cozy.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.045
Looks like you started without me.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.686
Where have you been since Thursday night?

38:39.717 --> 38:41.719
Well...

38:41.753 --> 38:44.097
As you probably figured out by now,

38:44.122 --> 38:46.295
I have-- I have a coke problem.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.469
Thursday night I was on a binge.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.872
Coking, drinking.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.137
Anyone with you Thursday to Sunday?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.645
I don't know. Probably the escorts.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.705
You have to check my credit card for that.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.580
When these things happen to me, I...

39:02.607 --> 39:06.054
I become a pretty bad boy.

39:12.116 --> 39:15.029
Why do you keep looking at her

39:15.053 --> 39:16.589
when I'm the one talking to you?

39:16.621 --> 39:19.727
- I'm being polite.
- You were coming on to her, weren't you?

39:19.757 --> 39:22.567
( laughing ) He's...

39:24.395 --> 39:27.376
- You had enough of this guy?
- Plenty.

39:27.398 --> 39:30.572
I need to go wash off the slime.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.148
(laughing)

39:38.142 --> 39:40.452
She's--

39:40.478 --> 39:42.890
she's your-- your type.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.894
Hmm? Hmm?

39:44.916 --> 39:49.160
- Like your girlfriends, Angie, Marie, Irina.
- Those aren't my girlfriends.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.997
Their numbers were on your speed dial.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.400
You erased them, I know,

39:53.424 --> 39:55.461
but our technicians recovered them.

39:55.493 --> 39:56.904
For a Yale lawyer,

39:56.928 --> 39:59.807
you should know better
than to lie about the obvious.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.640
All right, I was seeing them.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.577
Angie, when did you last see her?

40:03.601 --> 40:06.275
Sunday night,

40:06.304 --> 40:08.284
when my wife had already gone to bed.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.253
She said you had dinner with a client.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.187
- That's right.
- What restaurant?

40:13.211 --> 40:17.182
- I don't know.
- You had clams casino.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.627
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

40:19.651 --> 40:23.656
You remember what I said
about lying about the obvious?

40:23.688 --> 40:25.497
So you know I had dinner with Marie.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.332
Then you should also know

40:27.358 --> 40:30.100
that we got out of there just after 8:30.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.268
Marie Rimer. She was a hot little number.

40:33.298 --> 40:36.711
- Who cares?! I went home.
- ( sighs )

40:36.734 --> 40:39.340
You know, I have a theory
about why certain men

40:39.370 --> 40:42.374
are attracted to petite women.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.648
- You want to hear it?
- Not particularly.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.280
Petite women...

40:46.311 --> 40:49.292
Are a snug fit for small men.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.294
That's so ridiculous.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.796
No.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.923
I think I'm onto something here.

40:55.954 --> 41:00.096
Small men can feel like
they have a Titan missile

41:00.124 --> 41:01.467
in their pocket.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.972
Like they're a big man on the campus.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.771
That's how it felt when
you made love to them.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.971
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.879
Come on, man, you're a small guy.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.679
What size shoe do you wear? I wear a 13.

41:14.706 --> 41:18.779
You look like... like a nine...

41:19.777 --> 41:21.518
Or more like an eight?

41:21.546 --> 41:24.686
I'm an-- why am I even--
I don't want to talk to you about this!

41:24.716 --> 41:27.697
- Don't drag me into this!
- Ah, you got small hands, too.

41:27.719 --> 41:28.959
(laughing)

41:28.987 --> 41:30.796
- Isn't that the giveaway?
- Ohh.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.665
You've always felt inadequate.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.761
That's why you're always screwing around.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.262
- No. No.
- You couldn't hack it with
the big law firms,

41:38.296 --> 41:40.071
you couldn't "measure" up--

41:40.098 --> 41:43.011
whoops-- to your peers...

41:43.034 --> 41:44.604
That's not true. That's not true.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.241
...while these women,
they made you feel powerful.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.683
You could dominate them.

41:49.707 --> 41:52.085
But one of them, what,

41:52.110 --> 41:54.386
wanted something more from you?

41:55.947 --> 41:58.052
Threatened to have you disbarred?

41:58.082 --> 41:59.425
Ruin your marriage

41:59.450 --> 42:01.760
with that cash machine
that you call a wife?

42:01.786 --> 42:03.629
No, I was home!

42:03.654 --> 42:05.634
Why don't you just ask my wife?!

42:05.656 --> 42:07.033
We did.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.173
She told us about Marie's red blouse,

42:11.195 --> 42:14.301
the white jacket in the trunk of your car!

42:14.332 --> 42:16.243
She knows your game, Henry.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.709
She's been watching you through that glass

42:19.737 --> 42:22.741
ever since you came in here
with Detective Eames.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.157
Oh, Denise...

42:28.179 --> 42:30.250
Denise! Denise!

42:30.281 --> 42:32.784
It's not true. It's not true!

42:32.817 --> 42:34.990
She's through being your lifeboat,

42:35.019 --> 42:36.965
your Rock of Gibraltar, Henry.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.729
Listen to me. It's only been you.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.702
It's only you. I swear to God!

42:40.725 --> 42:43.331
This time she's letting you drown.

42:43.361 --> 42:45.500
No. No, she can't do this.

42:45.530 --> 42:47.669
Why do you think I did this, you bitch?!

42:47.698 --> 42:49.439
- ( sighs )
- Huh?!

42:49.467 --> 42:52.311
I did it for you! You hear me?!

42:52.336 --> 42:54.612
- You hear me?!
- You know what she told me?

42:54.639 --> 42:58.746
She takes drugs
because you couldn't satisfy her!

42:58.776 --> 43:00.585
You never could get her over the hump.

43:00.611 --> 43:02.522
( screams )

43:04.148 --> 43:05.786
You're dead, Denise!

43:05.817 --> 43:07.490
Dead. Do you hear me?

43:07.518 --> 43:10.089
Dead! Don't-- don't leave me!

43:10.121 --> 43:12.624
Denise, Denise.

43:12.657 --> 43:15.331
You're dead! You're dead.

43:15.359 --> 43:17.635
You hear me? You’re dead!

43:20.164 --> 43:22.770
Now she gets to go home and tell her kids.

43:32.677 --> 43:34.782
( theme music playing )
