WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.402
Hey!
Whoo!

00:03.404 --> 00:05.738
Jerk!

00:07.675 --> 00:08.773
Yeah!

00:11.678 --> 00:12.878
Yeah!

00:12.880 --> 00:15.948
Those begonias are annuals,
you jerk!

00:15.950 --> 00:17.215
Yeah! Whoo!

00:18.419 --> 00:20.753
There's a boy in the lane.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.756
Yes, mom, he'll move.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.625
It don't look like
he's moving.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.093
Thank you, mother.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.797
whoo!

00:36.437 --> 00:38.069
Thank you for signing
for this.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.438
I got caught up
at the clinic last night.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.941
Yeah, sure.

00:41.943 --> 00:44.143
How are you liking working
with the living, by the way?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.011
You know, it's incredible.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.545
I assisted with a caesarean.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.849
Just couldn't resist
cutting something open, huh?

00:49.851 --> 00:51.950
It was
the obstetrician's call.

00:51.953 --> 00:55.321
You brought life into the world.
I signed for a package.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.322
My god! Is there anything
we can't do?

00:57.325 --> 00:59.125
what is that, anyway?

00:59.127 --> 01:00.693
Well, you know how you can
never recognize me

01:00.694 --> 01:02.261
At my fencing tournaments?

01:02.262 --> 01:05.163
Yeah, 'cause you all look like
giant tampons in face masks?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.798
I ordered
a custom sabre guard

01:06.800 --> 01:09.300
So that you could pick me out
of the crowd.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.470
Oh.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.838
Oh!

01:12.840 --> 01:15.474
<i>oh.</i>Yes.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.108
I'm quite sure
the ladies at the club

01:17.111 --> 01:18.677
Will not appreciate this.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.412
Well, when they are distracted,
the advantage is mine.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.680
Mm.
En garde.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.617
Mm.

01:24.619 --> 01:25.984
Is that how you did
your caesarean?

01:25.987 --> 01:27.786
just like that.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.322
No!

01:30.323 --> 01:31.990
Your chariot to logan awaits.

01:31.993 --> 01:36.728
is it that time al--
fine, i'll get my stuff.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.499
Okay, she's acting like
i'm taking her to jail.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.901
You have no idea how hard it was
to convince her

01:42.904 --> 01:45.704
To accept the fbi's invitation
to lecture at quantico.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.906
First class trip to d.C.?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.740
Teaching a class
of fbi trainees?

01:48.743 --> 01:50.609
what's not
to be excited about?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.244
It's economy
and a middle seat.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.680
And that's probably
going to be the highlight

01:54.681 --> 01:55.881
Of the entire trip.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.617
You get to share
your vast experience

01:58.619 --> 02:00.585
With a class
of fbi trainees.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.421
Yes, and in my vast experience,

02:02.423 --> 02:06.591
The words "fbi" and "sharing"
don't really go together.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.294
All right, well, this isn't
a case you're working.

02:08.296 --> 02:12.565
Approach it in the spirit
of education and cooperation.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.032
And reciprocation,

02:14.035 --> 02:15.601
Because the fbi's gonna
owe me huge after this.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.002
[ cellphones ring,
vibrate, beep ]

02:17.004 --> 02:18.436
Rizzoli.
Isles.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.507
That just doesn't
sound right.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.877
That's messed up.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.136
Fatal collision?

02:51.138 --> 02:52.972
Bike playing chicken
with an suv.

02:52.974 --> 02:54.707
Driver managed
to stop in time,

02:54.709 --> 02:56.841
But all of a sudden,
the bicyclist exploded.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.144
Excuse me?
That's what
they're telling us.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.780
Well, the shock of having caused
a traffic fatality

03:01.782 --> 03:04.650
Could prompt the mind to invent
a less culpable narrative.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.952
This narrative was given
by two additional witnesses.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.621
They're gonna work with
a sketch artist

03:08.623 --> 03:10.689
Down at the station.
Ah, they got a look
at the suspect?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.990
Nobody saw a suspect.

03:11.993 --> 03:13.525
They're giving a description
of the victim.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.462
Why would we need a sketch
of the the...

03:16.464 --> 03:19.531
Oh. Got it.

03:19.532 --> 03:24.069
The degree of these burns could
make fingerprinting impossible.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.605
Yeah, there was no id
in the backpack either.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.274
That's in better shape
than our victim.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.008
I'm guessing the bomb
isn't in there?

03:30.011 --> 03:31.877
We're not sure
there was a bomb.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.246
My team has yet to find
a detonator or a casing

03:34.248 --> 03:37.181
Consistent with any sort
of conventional explosive.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.484
Bag's clean. Csru can have it.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.220
Thank you.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.189
Could this guy have been
struck by lightning?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.358
The burns all appear
thermal in nature,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.994
So you can rule out electricity
as the source.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.231
No suspect, no bomb,
no act of god.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.868
We could have a case
of spontaneous human combustion.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.503
I'm pretty sure the human body

03:57.505 --> 03:59.505
Doesn't just blow up
for no reason.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.106
Maur.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.573
Sorry, frankie.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.910
Every investigated incident
of spontaneous human combustion

04:04.912 --> 04:08.179
Involved an overlooked
external ignition source.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.549
We need to figure out
what the source was here.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.326
Spontaneous combustion,
and i'm missing it?

04:21.328 --> 04:23.328
Maura says it's technically
not a real thing,

04:23.330 --> 04:25.463
But this could be the one time
she's wrong, right?

04:25.465 --> 04:28.099
It's the first time maura's
wrong, and i'm missing it?!

04:29.602 --> 04:30.935
I gotta go.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.171
Detective rizzoli.
Hi.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.671
Pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.808
Hi, agent davies.
Thank you for having me.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.241
Oh, no. Thanks for coming.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.609
Agent dean bet me i'd never
get you out of boston.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.144
Well, you made
a great sales pitch.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.647
Promised him i wouldn't let you
turn into a pumpkin.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.349
Okay, well, have me home
before midnight.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.352
yes, ma'am.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.655
Hey.
Hey.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.090
What's going on
over there?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.826
Don't know. She's been at it
all morning.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.064
Hey.
You looking for a new job?

05:00.066 --> 05:02.368
Oh, no, just going over
current events.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.036
With a highlighter?
What, is there a quiz later?

05:05.038 --> 05:08.573
Fine. I'm looking for
an apartment.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.942
For who?
Me.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.078
Okay, did something happen
with maura?

05:14.080 --> 05:18.282
No, everything is as great
as it's always been.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.184
Well, since i got my ged,

05:20.186 --> 05:23.255
I've got a new perspective
on life.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.589
I'm an adult.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.724
I don't wanna be crashing
at somebody else's place.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.059
It's not like you're sleeping
on her couch.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.594
Maura won't care.
<i>I</i>care.

05:29.596 --> 05:33.832
And please, don't say anything
until i find a place.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.200
I don't want her
talking me out of it.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.103
Fine. You're the adult.

05:39.106 --> 05:43.941
Oh, the best places
are online.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.013
None of the neighbors
recognize our victim

05:49.015 --> 05:50.648
From the eyewitness sketch.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.150
And there was nothing
at the scene

05:52.152 --> 05:53.684
To help identify him,
either.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.255
Everything was too damaged
from the fire.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.455
Dental records?

05:57.457 --> 06:00.258
No match in ncic's database
for missing persons.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.227
The only thing i could determine
is that it's a white male,

06:03.229 --> 06:04.762
20 to 25 years old,

06:04.764 --> 06:07.298
And the cause of death being
severe blast injury.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.736
I just got the dna results back
from the victim's body.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.904
Are we any closer
to identifying him?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.539
It's hard to tell, really.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.075
It says here
that the sample came

06:16.076 --> 06:19.243
From the interior thoracic cage
just behind the sternum.

06:19.245 --> 06:22.013
Because that's where
i took it from.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.314
Yeah.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.683
That is the interior thoracic
cage behind the sternum.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.318
And you used
an ultra-flocked swab?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.654
Like i've done
a thousand times before.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.623
Kent, are you trying to say that
the test was inconclusive?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.225
Mm.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.361
Maybe a little bit
<i>too</i>conclusive.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.628
What does that even mean?

06:37.630 --> 06:39.197
Well, it means that our test
didn't return

06:39.200 --> 06:40.898
One dna profile
from our victim's body.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.101
It returned five.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.799
I ran a sketch of our victim
through facial recognition,

06:49.801 --> 06:52.368
But it returned
10,000 possible matches.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.103
Any one could be our guy.

06:54.105 --> 06:55.504
Or our<i>guys.</i>

06:55.506 --> 06:57.039
Well, the victim's body
had, like,

06:57.041 --> 06:59.008
Five different dna profiles,
right?

06:59.010 --> 07:01.978
Maybe he just had
a blood transfusion...Or four.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.579
Or maybe our bicyclist

07:03.581 --> 07:06.082
Was really five little rascals
under a trench coat.

07:06.084 --> 07:09.018
then let's hope
alfalfa's a violent felon.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.621
Hmm.
I submitted all five profiles
to codis.

07:11.623 --> 07:14.690
Mm-hmm.
Maybe there'll be a match
to our victim or killer.

07:14.692 --> 07:16.892
Well, don't be so quick
to assume there<i>is</i>a killer.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.062
Again with the spontaneous
human combustion?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.297
I'm just saying it's possible.

07:21.299 --> 07:23.466
Well, hopefully,
you'll stop saying it.

07:23.468 --> 07:26.736
According to wikipedia,
the jury's still out.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.504
There is not enough time
in the day

07:28.506 --> 07:29.739
To keep that site honest.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.941
Further analysis
of the victim's wounds

07:31.943 --> 07:35.211
Indicate that the explosive
came from below the body.

07:38.149 --> 07:39.749
Wait a minute.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.217
This is the same model bike
that our victim was riding.

07:41.219 --> 07:42.485
and look what's below the seat.

07:42.487 --> 07:44.220
A water bottle mount.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.721
If an explosive was
in the bottle,

07:45.723 --> 07:47.256
Someone could've planted it
long before our victim

07:47.258 --> 07:48.924
Even got on his bike.

07:48.926 --> 07:53.229
So...Not
spontaneous human combustion?

07:53.231 --> 07:54.630
More like murder.

07:54.632 --> 07:56.866
I'll have kent test
the water bottle pieces

07:56.868 --> 07:58.834
For any explosive residue.

07:58.836 --> 08:01.837
And facial recognition
gave you all those results?

08:01.839 --> 08:03.873
The sketch may look like
our victim to the human eye,

08:03.875 --> 08:05.641
But if it's off by even
a few millimeters,

08:05.643 --> 08:07.576
The software can think
it's a different person.

08:07.578 --> 08:09.478
The sketch is just
too imprecise.

08:10.348 --> 08:12.415
I may be able to help
with that.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.524
How's it look?

08:21.526 --> 08:23.959
Give me one more pass
on the left-hand side.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.862
nice job getting your hands
on this, kent.

08:26.864 --> 08:28.331
Mm. My pleasure.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.533
Although, my mate at the v.A.
Was rather curious

08:30.535 --> 08:32.468
As to why the coroner's office
required

08:32.470 --> 08:34.003
A medical grade 3d scanner.

08:34.005 --> 08:36.272
I just told him that we were
fitting a corpse

08:36.274 --> 08:37.673
For a pair
of prosthetic legs.

08:39.177 --> 08:40.743
Well, then i hope you told him
what we're really doing.

08:40.745 --> 08:43.479
What? And dispel
my carefully crafted

08:43.481 --> 08:45.348
Air of mystique and whimsy?

08:45.350 --> 08:48.217
Dr. Isles, i thought you knew me
better than that.

08:48.219 --> 08:50.052
Okay, how does it look now?

08:50.855 --> 08:53.356
Looks like my granny's
wig stand.

08:53.358 --> 08:57.159
All right. Let's map
the eyewitness sketch on it.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.828
Okay.

09:01.232 --> 09:03.099
Move the eyes on the socket.

09:03.101 --> 09:05.201
Mouth up.

09:05.203 --> 09:06.602
There?
Mm-hmm.

09:06.604 --> 09:11.040
Just add some skin tone.

09:11.042 --> 09:12.375
Some hair color.

09:15.313 --> 09:18.881
and here's johnny!

09:18.883 --> 09:20.783
...Doe.

09:20.785 --> 09:22.485
Okay, send that to nina.
Nice work.

09:22.487 --> 09:25.888
<i></i>

09:25.890 --> 09:29.325
Well, if it isn't the fbi's
most wanted instructor.

09:29.327 --> 09:30.559
<i>How's quantico?</i>

09:30.561 --> 09:32.261
It's fine.
Show me the handlebars.

09:32.263 --> 09:33.629
You've been talking
to frankie.

09:33.631 --> 09:35.264
Are the arms
really still attached?

09:35.266 --> 09:38.134
<i>You know, i find your interest</i>
<i>in this a bit grotesque.</i>

09:38.136 --> 09:39.568
Show me!

09:44.542 --> 09:47.076
<i>Oh, so gross.</i>

09:47.078 --> 09:48.778
I can't believe i'm missing it!

09:48.780 --> 09:53.416
And i can't believe you packed
khakis and a polo?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.084
<i>Oh.</i>

09:55.086 --> 09:56.452
No, no, i didn't. It --

09:56.454 --> 09:58.521
Agent davies thought
it would be good for me

09:58.523 --> 10:00.089
To dress like the trainees,
so it...

10:00.091 --> 10:02.558
<i>You're considering it?</i>
<i>Is he cute?</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:04.960
<i>Tell me about</i>
<i>this agent davies.</i>

10:04.962 --> 10:06.695
No, it -- he's...

10:06.697 --> 10:08.764
<i>Huge,</i>
huge blue eyes, and i...

10:08.766 --> 10:11.600
No, he's fbi. Whatever.
Are you kidding?

10:11.602 --> 10:13.335
And honestly, i would wear
a clown suit

10:13.337 --> 10:14.904
If i thought it would help.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.839
Please listen to these people
that i'm supposed to teach.

10:16.841 --> 10:17.840
Okay, ready?

10:17.842 --> 10:20.676
Valedictorian.
Doctor of psychology.

10:20.678 --> 10:22.445
Rhodes scholar. Really?

10:22.447 --> 10:24.647
But you chase killers
on a daily basis.

10:24.649 --> 10:26.582
I don't think
a few straight-"a" students

10:26.584 --> 10:28.217
Could possibly scare you.

10:28.219 --> 10:31.420
<i>No, i'm not scared.</i>
<i>But i just... </i>

10:31.422 --> 10:32.888
<i>How am i gonna connect</i>

10:32.890 --> 10:34.490
<i>To a bunch</i>
<i>of overachieving millennials?</i>

10:34.492 --> 10:36.025
Well, don't forget,
you're an overachiever, too.

10:36.027 --> 10:39.161
<i>You've got it in you.</i>
<i>No clown costume required.</i>

10:39.163 --> 10:40.696
Thank you.

10:40.698 --> 10:45.167
I'm gonna go write my talk
or speech, whatever it is.

10:45.169 --> 10:46.869
And i think kent needs you.

10:46.871 --> 10:49.438
Oh. I, uh, didn't wanna
interrupt.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.906
That'd be rude, right?

10:50.908 --> 10:52.141
Okay. Bye!

10:52.143 --> 10:54.710
<i>Bye, jane!</i>

10:57.815 --> 10:59.348
Well?

10:59.350 --> 11:00.883
Oh! Yeah. Nina.

11:00.885 --> 11:03.319
she already
identified our bicyclist

11:03.321 --> 11:04.553
From the image that
we sent over.

11:07.024 --> 11:10.426
Hmm. See? Pixar's got
nothing on us.

11:10.428 --> 11:12.061
Booyah.

11:12.063 --> 11:13.496
Don't leave me hangin'.

11:15.266 --> 11:16.632
Awkward.

11:18.503 --> 11:21.170
And the classroom's hooked up
with a projector

11:21.172 --> 11:23.038
For any audio/video needs.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.907
Should i have
audio/video needs?

11:24.909 --> 11:26.175
Totally optional.

11:26.177 --> 11:28.677
J. Edgar hoover didn't have
audio/video needs.

11:28.679 --> 11:30.980
Yes, but i heard he had
a fabulous dress collection.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.215
We don't make those jokes here.
I'm sorry.

11:33.217 --> 11:35.784
His high heel collection was
really the thing to see.

11:35.786 --> 11:38.187
oh, sorry, detective.
One moment.

11:38.189 --> 11:39.622
Yeah.
Davies.

11:41.192 --> 11:42.992
Have you seen her cases?
She's like a super cop.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.260
Yeah, in boston.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.161
They couldn't have found
one guy on the federal level

11:46.163 --> 11:47.563
To teach this stuff?

11:48.866 --> 11:50.699
Sorry, again.

11:50.701 --> 11:52.835
Shall we?
Yeah.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.246
wow.

12:04.248 --> 12:06.382
I can see why someone would
want to kill robert hall

12:06.384 --> 12:08.784
For his sweet bachelor pad.

12:08.786 --> 12:10.419
What does this guy do
for a living?

12:10.421 --> 12:12.354
Nina didn't find
a current employer.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.323
Huh.

12:14.325 --> 12:16.559
Oh!

12:16.561 --> 12:19.161
He had a razer vr headset.

12:19.163 --> 12:21.997
His parents mentioned
bankrolling him when you spoke?

12:21.999 --> 12:23.332
The opposite.

12:23.334 --> 12:24.967
When he dropped out
of high school and got arrested

12:24.969 --> 12:26.635
For drug possession, they tried
to get him clean.

12:26.637 --> 12:29.104
But when he ran away from rehab
the second time,

12:29.106 --> 12:30.639
They cut him off completely.

12:30.641 --> 12:33.242
Well, maybe he's trying
to turn his life around.

12:33.244 --> 12:35.945
No arrests in the last year,
so it's possible.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.347
Even so, how does a kid
with no job

12:38.349 --> 12:42.117
Who's been cut off from
his family afford all this?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.589
He was an entrepreneur.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.557
Why do you say that?

12:49.527 --> 12:51.894
Meth lab gave it away.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.693
All in all, we seized nearly
$20,000 in cash

12:58.695 --> 13:01.596
And 4 pounds of crystal meth
at robert hall's apartment.

13:01.598 --> 13:03.531
If someone killed him
over drugs or money,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.133
Why not take the drugs
or money?

13:05.135 --> 13:06.734
I paid a visit
to detective o'connell.

13:06.736 --> 13:08.469
The drug unit's seen an influx
of high purity meth

13:08.471 --> 13:09.804
The last 12 months.

13:09.806 --> 13:12.473
They think this kitchen turned
meth lab's the source.

13:12.475 --> 13:14.342
It's sophisticated enough.
Just one problem.

13:14.344 --> 13:16.144
Hall's equipment
has barely been used.

13:16.146 --> 13:17.745
How does a high school dropout
know how to build

13:17.747 --> 13:19.213
A sophisticated meth lab?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.648
I already checked
hall's old chemistry teacher.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.851
He's clean.
But maybe he had help from

13:23.853 --> 13:27.055
One of the other little rascals
in the trench coat.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.858
Codis got a match for one of
the five dna profiles

13:30.860 --> 13:32.326
Found on the body.

13:32.328 --> 13:34.629
David yao, aka big yao.

13:34.631 --> 13:36.631
leader of a small-time
street gang.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.100
Aggravated assault,
armed robbery,

13:39.102 --> 13:40.768
Drug trafficking.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.837
Maybe hall learned to cook meth
from a more experienced partner.

13:42.839 --> 13:45.406
A partner wouldn't be too happy
to discover that he was

13:45.408 --> 13:46.941
Setting up his own shop at home.

13:46.943 --> 13:48.176
I'll talk to drug unit,

13:48.178 --> 13:50.411
Have them set up a talk
with big yao.

13:52.348 --> 13:56.718
Uh, obviously, um, if you can
find a web site

13:56.720 --> 14:00.922
That tells you a guy
who blinks too much is lying,

14:00.924 --> 14:03.091
Well, then, your suspect can
as well.

14:08.565 --> 14:11.132
But you're all
very smart individuals.

14:11.134 --> 14:13.101
You probably already know that.

14:14.738 --> 14:16.404
Okay, um...

14:16.406 --> 14:21.776
The reason that i didn't go
to a 4-year college was that...

14:21.778 --> 14:24.612
Ugh. I just -- i just dreaded
the thought of having to listen

14:24.614 --> 14:26.881
To a teacher<i>drone</i>on and on.

14:26.883 --> 14:30.485
I-i wanted to get out there.
I wanted to do it for myself.

14:30.487 --> 14:32.553
Um...

14:33.890 --> 14:35.022
So let's do that.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.557
Um...

14:36.559 --> 14:40.561
Instead of talking about
an interrogation,

14:40.563 --> 14:42.330
Why don't we just --
just do one?

14:43.433 --> 14:44.832
Uh, you.

14:44.834 --> 14:46.367
Kyle price.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.603
I didn't even have to ask
a question.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.405
Come on over here, kyle.
Have a seat.

14:52.442 --> 14:54.776
Don't worry.
I won't hurt you.

14:54.778 --> 14:56.744
All right.

14:56.746 --> 15:00.047
So, kyle, tell me about
your hobbies.

15:00.049 --> 15:03.251
Um...
I like watching movies.

15:03.253 --> 15:05.319
Okay, like, uh,
like tough guy movies?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.555
Yeah.
All right.

15:07.557 --> 15:09.724
Uh, and be honest,

15:09.726 --> 15:13.461
When was the last time
that you took your fake gun

15:13.463 --> 15:16.531
And "taxi driver"ed
in the bathroom mirror?

15:19.002 --> 15:21.335
Never.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.138
Are you embarrassed by it?
No.

15:24.140 --> 15:27.241
So you're not embarrassed?
Well, no, that's not
what i meant.

15:27.243 --> 15:28.643
Agent davies, uh,

15:28.645 --> 15:31.746
Could you fire up
that projector for me, please?

15:31.748 --> 15:32.780
What are you doing?

15:32.782 --> 15:35.416
Well, this place is crawling
with cameras.

15:35.418 --> 15:37.285
You didn't...

15:37.287 --> 15:38.519
You didn't think that

15:38.521 --> 15:40.221
They missed the bathroom, too,
did you?

15:40.223 --> 15:41.722
I don't believe you.

15:41.724 --> 15:45.193
More importantly, kyle,
i don't believe<i>you.</i>

15:46.496 --> 15:48.696
So what are we gonna find
on that video?

15:51.835 --> 15:54.468
All right, all right, stop.
All right, don't do it.

15:55.438 --> 15:58.673
I didn't "taxi driver."

15:58.675 --> 15:59.941
I "dirty harry"ed.

16:04.647 --> 16:07.982
When you establish a connection
with your suspect,

16:07.984 --> 16:12.253
It opens the door for a tactic
like deception.

16:12.255 --> 16:14.589
Really?
Cameras in the bathroom?

16:15.859 --> 16:17.592
All right, we're just
getting started.

16:17.594 --> 16:19.794
You know, the best thing
about a uniform

16:19.796 --> 16:22.363
Is that you can wear them
a few days in a row

16:22.365 --> 16:24.131
Without anybody noticing.
Am i right?

16:24.133 --> 16:25.633
I always wash my clothes,
detective.

16:25.635 --> 16:27.335
Let's talk about
what you're afraid of.

16:27.337 --> 16:29.837
Nothing.
There is no way

16:29.839 --> 16:32.773
That anyone sticks to
the arbitrary curfew rules.

16:32.775 --> 16:34.542
The rules are here
for a reason.

16:34.544 --> 16:37.411
My brother's a grown-ass man,
and he is afraid of spiders.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.347
No, no, like, you don't have to
be embarrassed about it.

16:39.349 --> 16:42.350
Like, we all slept in
our clothes once in a while.

16:42.352 --> 16:46.120
This is not a lie --
i actually shot myself,

16:46.122 --> 16:47.521
And i am not ashamed to say,

16:47.523 --> 16:49.557
I don't ever want that
to happen again.

16:49.559 --> 16:50.892
Not afraid of bullets.

16:50.894 --> 16:53.661
I guess i've gone
a couple days before.

16:53.663 --> 16:56.597
Really? Without changing
your underwear?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.934
That's minimization.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.703
When you convince someone
that it's not a crime,

17:02.705 --> 17:04.405
Watch how quickly
they'll admit to it.

17:04.407 --> 17:08.142
So was that just after
zero hundred

17:08.144 --> 17:10.144
Or not until
the next morning?

17:10.146 --> 17:11.445
Just after.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.148
So you<i>were</i>out past curfew?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.452
That's the alternative question.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.455
Either alternative is still
an admission of guilt.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.224
You ever leave the light on
at night?

17:23.226 --> 17:24.825
Sure. I've left it on
a few times.

17:24.827 --> 17:26.727
Sounds like a night-light
to me.

17:28.965 --> 17:33.334
But who isn't afraid of the dark
every once in a while, right?

17:33.336 --> 17:35.703
Very nice. Thank you.

17:38.408 --> 17:42.677
Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Thanks. Bye. Thank you.

17:42.679 --> 17:44.211
Thanks.

17:44.213 --> 17:46.047
I've had the same bra
for 10 years.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.548
I always wear
clean underwear.

17:47.550 --> 17:50.518
I believe you.

17:51.621 --> 17:53.621
Hey, thanks for letting me
put you on the spot.

17:53.623 --> 17:56.023
It's no problem, detective.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.527
I didn't mean to upset you.
You didn't.

17:59.529 --> 18:03.397
Your presentation was
really...Cute.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.001
I've got it.

18:19.248 --> 18:20.815
So the water bottle
that blew up

18:20.817 --> 18:23.884
Had traces of glycerin
and potassium perma...

18:23.886 --> 18:25.653
Permanganate.

18:25.655 --> 18:27.888
I'm just gonna
type that one in.

18:27.890 --> 18:30.725
It's an oxidizing agent
used in water treatment.

18:30.727 --> 18:32.393
The glycerin is sugar alcohol

18:32.395 --> 18:34.829
With uses from food sweetener
to antifreeze.

18:34.831 --> 18:37.999
Innocent enough apart,
but together, highly combustive.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.533
Hopefully there's someone
in big yao's gang

18:39.535 --> 18:41.168
With a connection
to those compounds,

18:41.170 --> 18:45.006
Because i haven't had any luck
connecting them with our victim.

18:45.008 --> 18:47.808
So robert hall wasn't in any
of the surveillance photos

18:47.810 --> 18:49.410
From the gang unit?
Nope.

18:49.412 --> 18:51.345
So unless big yao
just volunteers

18:51.347 --> 18:53.080
How his dna ended up
at the scene,

18:53.082 --> 18:55.116
Frankie and korsak have nothing
to sweat him with

18:55.118 --> 18:56.384
When he's brought in.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.185
Wait.<i>That's</i>big yao?

18:58.187 --> 19:01.022
Selling weed at boylston
and tremont three months ago.

19:01.024 --> 19:02.857
So when was this picture taken?

19:02.859 --> 19:04.625
Last friday. I know.

19:04.627 --> 19:07.895
If nothing else, the guys can
at least get his diet secrets.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.498
There is no amount of diet
or exercise

19:10.500 --> 19:12.867
That will yield results
that quickly.

19:12.869 --> 19:15.336
When big yao gets here,
have them find out

19:15.338 --> 19:18.339
When and where he did
his liposuction.

19:21.177 --> 19:23.544
Liposuction?

19:27.250 --> 19:30.117
How'd it go in interrogation?
Well, it wasn't easy,

19:30.119 --> 19:31.986
But eventually,
we got a full confession.

19:31.988 --> 19:33.921
About the murder?
About the lipo.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.657
Big yao is a patient
of dr. Verusca vela.

19:36.659 --> 19:38.159
Licensed cosmetic surgeon.

19:38.161 --> 19:39.493
Other than proving that

19:39.495 --> 19:41.362
Big yao is the most vain
gangster in boston,

19:41.364 --> 19:43.230
What does this have to do
with our murder?

19:43.232 --> 19:45.833
I'm working on a hypothesis
about the murder weapon.

19:45.835 --> 19:48.469
Glycerin, one of the compounds
found in the water bottle,

19:48.471 --> 19:50.037
Is normally purchased
commercially.

19:50.039 --> 19:52.573
But if someone didn't want it
traced back to them,

19:52.575 --> 19:54.542
They could make it
on their own

19:54.544 --> 19:57.244
By melting fat,

19:57.246 --> 19:59.080
Like that removed by
liposuction.

19:59.082 --> 20:02.016
Down to tallow, mixing it
with a little lye and salt,

20:02.018 --> 20:05.653
And voilÃ ,
you've got homemade glycerin.

20:05.655 --> 20:08.022
Is that...From a person?

20:08.024 --> 20:09.290
Cow.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.258
Oh. Good.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.660
It smells delicious.

20:12.662 --> 20:14.428
Well, if you have access,
liposuction byproduct

20:14.430 --> 20:17.431
Is the easiest way to get enough
fat without anybody noticing.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.166
I mean, you wouldn't believe
the looks i got

20:19.168 --> 20:21.335
Just for ordering 10 pounds
of bovine leaf fat

20:21.337 --> 20:23.104
From the butcher.
Oh, i believe it.

20:23.106 --> 20:26.774
Well, our killer would've needed
a lot more than i did,

20:26.776 --> 20:29.143
Because my demonstration
is just 1/10th the size.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.279
Demonstration?
I do need to test
my hypothesis.

20:32.281 --> 20:33.914
Kent.

20:33.916 --> 20:35.382
Ah, yes.

20:35.384 --> 20:37.485
Now, pay attention.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.820
On the bottom, we have
homemade glycerin.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.423
On the top,
we have potassium permanganate.

20:42.425 --> 20:45.493
Now, you mix
these two puppies together

20:45.495 --> 20:48.095
And bang!

20:48.097 --> 20:50.531
any questions?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.535
In the middle, this layer of fat
is strong enough

20:54.537 --> 20:56.003
To keep them from combining,

20:56.005 --> 20:59.006
But weak enough
to spread apart when shaken.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.207
Like during a bike ride.

21:00.209 --> 21:02.776
So you think that someone made
the explosive

21:02.778 --> 21:05.679
That killed robert hall
with...Lipo fat?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.815
Well, if the experiment
proves tenable,

21:07.817 --> 21:09.817
Then it would explain
the other dna

21:09.819 --> 21:12.253
And why we didn't find any
trigger mechanism at the scene.

21:12.255 --> 21:14.455
It's no wonder jane
comes down here all the time.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.090
You guys have all the fun.

21:16.092 --> 21:18.792
She's gonna hate that she
missed out on the fat bomb.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.161
well, it's actually

21:20.163 --> 21:22.830
A lipid-accelerating
exothermic combustive device.

21:22.832 --> 21:24.798
No, that's not as sexy
as fat bomb.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.834
Well, the office of
the chief medical examiner

21:26.836 --> 21:29.036
Is not gonna write "fat bomb"
as a cause of death.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.105
It's made of fat.
It is a bomb.

21:31.107 --> 21:33.207
What? You, too.
If the fat bomb fits...

21:33.209 --> 21:36.810
People, please. Can we just let
the science speak for itself?

21:36.812 --> 21:40.381
Now, i want you to look
into this box,

21:40.383 --> 21:42.650
Look into your hearts...

21:44.120 --> 21:46.720
And tell me...

21:46.722 --> 21:49.223
What would you call this?

21:58.968 --> 22:02.036
Sorry, maura.
I'm with fat bomb.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.162
Finally.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.931
I have two procedures
scheduled this afternoon

22:13.933 --> 22:16.667
And i would very much prefer
not to miss either one of them.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.802
Nobody needs botox that bad.

22:18.804 --> 22:22.406
I don't add poison
to the body.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.174
I free it of excess.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.476
And get pretty creative
with it, too, apparently.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.780
Can't even imagine what
you're implying, officer.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.048
It's sergeant.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.151
And i'm not implying anything,
dr. Vela.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.119
I already know what you did
with david yao's fat

22:36.121 --> 22:39.089
After the liposuction.
Sorry, i don't know
who that is.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.458
Maybe you know him
as big yao,

22:41.460 --> 22:44.561
Or not-so-big yao,
thanks to you.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.229
You need to stop lying.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.768
Doctor/patient
confidentiality.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.937
My apologies.
Mm-hmm.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.872
How about you explain how
fat from big yao

22:55.874 --> 22:58.842
And three more of your patients
got synthesized into the bomb

22:58.844 --> 23:00.243
That killed a young man?

23:00.245 --> 23:02.045
I have
before and after pictures,

23:02.047 --> 23:04.381
Since that's something
you're more familiar with.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.254
A bomb?

23:11.256 --> 23:12.956
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.259
Then you won't mind
if we check your records,

23:16.261 --> 23:17.828
See if you purchased
any controlled substances

23:17.830 --> 23:19.396
With your medical credentials?

23:19.398 --> 23:23.567
Yeah. I mean, that -- that's --
that's not a problem.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.204
The fat goes into
decanting cannisters,

23:27.206 --> 23:29.806
And -- and then i never
see it again.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.042
It's sunland medical waste that
removes it from the premises.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.544
But they are supposed
to incinerate it right away.

23:34.546 --> 23:37.481
I'll take that information
as well.

23:37.483 --> 23:38.882
Fine.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.224
Hi.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.726
Hey.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.994
Last place no good?

23:50.996 --> 23:53.030
Oh, i'm pretty sure
half the units there

23:53.032 --> 23:54.598
Are rented out by the hour.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.903
You know,
there's an easier option.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.905
Yeah, i know.
The internet.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.541
No. Maura's.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.844
Ma, you've got a great thing
going here. Why change that?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.581
Do you remember
when you were 15

24:11.583 --> 24:15.485
And you asked me to stop
cutting your hair?

24:15.487 --> 24:17.888
Kind of.
Kind of?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.257
It was a huge decision
for you.

24:20.259 --> 24:23.660
You sat me down like -- like you
were gonna move out.

24:23.662 --> 24:27.597
Well, we hated giving you
adjustments.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.299
You remember the time
when i asked you

24:29.301 --> 24:30.967
To stop putting oregano
on my pasta?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.602
Hey, i don't wanna talk
about that.

24:32.604 --> 24:35.405
See?

24:35.407 --> 24:37.207
You wanted to go
to the barber

24:37.209 --> 24:39.276
Like all the boys
in the neighborhood.

24:39.278 --> 24:43.113
You even paid for it yourself.
It made you feel like a man.

24:44.683 --> 24:45.949
I get it.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.284
Ah.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.720
No, i'm gonna
make your life easier.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.121
Who are you calling?

24:51.123 --> 24:54.825
No one. We are gonna find
you an apartment.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.193
There. See?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.795
Oh. Could you make it bigger?

24:58.797 --> 25:00.030
What? The apartment?

25:00.032 --> 25:02.499
No, the -- the screen.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.175
sergeant. Come in.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.244
Hey. I'm stuck waiting
on a subpoena

25:14.246 --> 25:16.513
For sunland medical's
personnel records.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.482
Were you able to find anything
in dr. Vela's file

25:18.484 --> 25:20.317
That ties her to robert hall's
meth business?

25:20.319 --> 25:22.319
Well, there was
no pseudoephedrine

25:22.321 --> 25:25.555
Or any other suspicious
chemicals in her purchase order.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.523
But?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.191
But i did notice
something else.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.794
So according to her records,
dr. Vela has performed

25:30.796 --> 25:33.597
Enough liposuction surgeries
to remove approximately

25:33.599 --> 25:36.500
1,000 pounds of aspirated fat
per month.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.503
So that would mean...

25:39.505 --> 25:41.738
Around 300
of these cannisters.

25:41.740 --> 25:46.143
Sunland was only billing her
to remove 100 of them per month.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.711
She's fat skimming.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.347
These are strict laws on
the disposal of medical waste.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.616
So paying sunland
at least something

25:52.618 --> 25:54.684
Would make her appear
compliant.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.720
And she could get rid
of the rest

25:56.722 --> 25:58.889
With someone less expensive.
Skirting around
numerous epa regulations.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.992
So she's not gonna admit
where that fat's ending up...

26:01.994 --> 26:03.560
But she might show us.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.263
Thanks, doc.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.739
Of course it's
the last car on the lot.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.175
Dr. Vela better not
keep us out here all night.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.210
[ inhales deeply,
exhales slowly ]

26:20.212 --> 26:22.979
It's a nice night, though.
I mean, look at that moon.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.415
I've never seen you be so happy
to be on a stakeout.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.651
I just spent
the last three hours

26:27.653 --> 26:29.286
Using the internet
with my mother.

26:29.288 --> 26:33.523
got it.
Well, welcome back.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.791
Korsak.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.593
Okay, that's just gross.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.662
She's transporting the fat
in her trunk?

26:38.664 --> 26:41.498
Well, i wouldn't want that
in my leather seats.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.600
Hold on.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.602
Maybe she's not transporting
it anywhere.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.537
Dumping it's
just as illegal.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.641
Boston police.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.477
Disposing of medical waste
in a civilian dumpster

26:54.479 --> 26:56.580
In the middle of the night?
On the day we talked to you?

26:56.582 --> 26:59.115
Boy, dumb criminals
make this job so easy.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.821
If there's nothing else,
officers...

27:10.028 --> 27:11.761
Hold it.
Ah.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.196
She's retrieving it.

27:13.198 --> 27:14.731
Knew we'd figure it out.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.967
How long have you been throwing
away fat like this?

27:16.969 --> 27:19.569
maybe a year.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.638
Business is really tough.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.974
People are working out
and eating healthy.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.475
Oh, don't blame it on kale.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.478
You've been cutting corners
to save your bottom line.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.013
At least i wasn't
making a bomb.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.781
It's still illegal.
Your employees know about this?

27:31.783 --> 27:35.118
You think i'd be toting fat down
here by myself in the dark

27:35.120 --> 27:37.087
If i was okay letting
someone else know?

27:37.089 --> 27:39.556
Well, somebody knows.

27:39.558 --> 27:40.790
Korsak.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.542
If you're calling to see
the fat bomb,

27:59.544 --> 28:01.344
First, that's not the name.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.347
Second, we've made a lot
of progress...

28:04.349 --> 28:05.815
Why do you have case face?

28:05.817 --> 28:07.284
Case face?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.019
<i>What have you gotten</i>
<i>yourself into?</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:12.088
One of the trainees...

28:12.090 --> 28:15.425
I embarrassed him, and i think
i touched a nerve.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.494
<i>When class was over,</i>
<i>he pulled the,</i>

28:17.496 --> 28:20.797
"hey, i dropped my pen. Can you
bend over and pick it up?" gag.

28:20.799 --> 28:22.432
Are you sure it wasn't
an accident?

28:22.434 --> 28:24.034
<i>Yeah, i'm sure.</i>

28:24.036 --> 28:26.136
All right, well, in a class
of overachievers,

28:26.138 --> 28:28.772
It's not surprising to find
at least one power complex.

28:28.774 --> 28:32.442
Yeah, and add a genius complex
and throw in some gender issues.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.411
I mean, i've certainly
dealt with worse,

28:34.413 --> 28:36.813
But none of them
carry badges.
<i>I hear you,</i>

28:36.815 --> 28:38.648
But dropping a pen
is hardly grounds

28:38.650 --> 28:40.850
For expulsion
from the fbi academy.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.553
<i>Plus, the bureau thoroughly</i>
<i>vets their recruits.</i>

28:43.555 --> 28:45.021
I mean, what are the chances
that this trainee

28:45.023 --> 28:48.191
Could slip past them even if
he does have some pathology?

28:48.193 --> 28:51.928
Or what if he just never
got caught?

28:51.930 --> 28:53.463
So i did some digging.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.365
<i>Check your e-mail.</i>

28:55.367 --> 28:58.468
<i>okay, three years ago, this guy</i>
<i>was editor-in-chief</i>

28:58.470 --> 29:00.070
<i>At his school newspaper.</i>

29:00.072 --> 29:02.939
<i>There was a freshman on</i>
<i>his staff named penny williams.</i>

29:02.941 --> 29:04.174
<i>She committed suicide.</i>

29:04.176 --> 29:05.809
She won a pacemaker award.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.011
<i>That's like a nobel prize</i>
<i>for journalism.</i>

29:08.013 --> 29:10.246
Yeah, becoming a journalist
was her dream,

29:10.248 --> 29:11.815
And i think he ruined it
for her.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.683
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>he murdered her?</i>

29:13.685 --> 29:17.454
No, but i think he played a part
in her unraveling

29:17.456 --> 29:18.788
Because he was threatened.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.857
<i>There were other</i>
<i>freshman there that had</i>

29:20.859 --> 29:22.726
10 to 15 articles published.
Penny only had two.

29:22.728 --> 29:25.095
For a nationally recognized
talent?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.997
Yeah. Something's off.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.367
Well, have you mentioned
this girl's suicide

29:30.369 --> 29:31.501
To special agent davies?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.969
He knew about it.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.671
The fbi did not know that
it was connected to shaun.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.240
But if i'm right about this,
i-i can't just do nothing.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.476
That's why you have
case face.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.378
You're gonna try and prove
a pattern

29:41.380 --> 29:42.979
Of misogynistic behavior.
Well, if i don't,

29:42.981 --> 29:45.115
They're gonna give this guy
federal authority in 12 weeks.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.516
<i>Well, you better get started.</i>

29:46.518 --> 29:49.686
You're only gonna be there
for 12 more hours.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.221
Yeah.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.522
Here's dr. Vela.

30:00.524 --> 30:02.090
This was last week?

30:02.092 --> 30:04.826
The night<i>after</i>big yao's
latest surgery.
Mm.

30:06.329 --> 30:09.397
After she leaves,
look who shows up.

30:09.399 --> 30:11.132
Hello, fat bandit.

30:11.134 --> 30:12.434
Can't see his car
or his face.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.735
Do you have another angle
on this lot?

30:13.737 --> 30:15.270
It's the only one
on the premises.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.605
But the boston joe's
across the street gave me this.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.942
dr. Vela left the building
at 11:14.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.744
Four minutes later...

30:24.281 --> 30:26.514
blue subaru outback.

30:26.516 --> 30:29.484
The resolution's too low
to get a plate.
It's a start.

30:29.486 --> 30:31.152
If that car belongs
to hall's drug partner,

30:31.154 --> 30:32.720
He's probably been
to his place before.

30:32.722 --> 30:35.023
Maybe a neighbor saw it.
I'll get my keys.

30:36.393 --> 30:39.027
Good idea getting the coffee
shop footage, holiday.

30:39.029 --> 30:40.428
I remembered frankie brought

30:40.430 --> 30:42.497
A boston joe's cup home
last night.

30:42.499 --> 30:43.698
Figured it was worth a shot.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.100
Hmm. You guys have
a nickname yet?

30:47.270 --> 30:49.637
Goodbye, vince.
Ninkie?

30:49.639 --> 30:51.506
frina?

30:51.508 --> 30:54.209
Holizzoli?

30:54.211 --> 30:56.244
Hmm.

30:56.246 --> 30:57.378
Rizziday.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.646
Ah...
Ah!

30:58.648 --> 30:59.848
There it is.

30:59.850 --> 31:00.982
Rizziday.
Mm-hmm.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.984
Have a nice rizziday.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.653
Thank you.
Yeah.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.326
Thanks for your time.

31:12.896 --> 31:15.063
Nothing. You guys?

31:15.065 --> 31:16.531
There's one person
who saw the car

31:16.533 --> 31:18.466
In front of hall's apartment
but never saw a driver.

31:18.468 --> 31:21.035
i can see if anyone
has a front door camera.

31:21.037 --> 31:23.338
It's worth a shot.

31:25.075 --> 31:27.408
Or we could talk
to the d.O.T.

31:27.410 --> 31:29.844
Worth a shot.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.283
Hi. Am i interrupting?

31:35.285 --> 31:37.051
Angela. Not at all.
Come on in.

31:37.053 --> 31:39.087
I, uh, i brought lunch.

31:39.089 --> 31:41.990
I made lunch. A-a big lunch.

31:41.992 --> 31:44.225
Lovely. Should we take it
to my office?

31:44.227 --> 31:46.094
Sure.

31:46.096 --> 31:48.696
Are we celebrating
some big news?

31:48.698 --> 31:50.164
The apartment hunt?

31:50.166 --> 31:53.101
Frankie. I can't believe
he blabbed about it.

31:53.103 --> 31:54.402
It wasn't frankie.

31:54.404 --> 31:56.170
The classified section
of my newspaper

31:56.172 --> 31:59.807
Has been disappearing
for the last week.

31:59.809 --> 32:01.476
Well, maybe i'm buying
a boat.

32:01.478 --> 32:06.247
i was looking
at apartments.

32:06.249 --> 32:09.384
But not because you have been
anything but delightful

32:09.386 --> 32:11.986
To live with.
I feel the same way about you.

32:11.988 --> 32:13.888
sit down.

32:15.992 --> 32:17.592
Ah, you know, maura,

32:17.594 --> 32:20.995
Part of my growth as
an independent woman this year

32:20.997 --> 32:24.032
Has been...
Well, learning...

32:24.034 --> 32:27.468
Learning about taking care
of myself by myself.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.270
I completely understand.

32:29.272 --> 32:31.306
But, you know, having a roommate
hasn't made me

32:31.308 --> 32:33.474
Any less of
an independent woman.

32:33.476 --> 32:36.644
Yeah, well, you are you.

32:38.348 --> 32:40.515
All right, well,
if you're moving out,

32:40.517 --> 32:42.884
I suppose i'll just get
another tenant.

32:42.886 --> 32:44.352
Do you know anyone
looking for a place?

32:44.354 --> 32:46.487
All right, i know what
you're doing.

32:46.489 --> 32:49.290
Okay. Can't you just live
in the carriage house

32:49.292 --> 32:51.626
And start paying me rent?

32:51.628 --> 32:55.496
Like any other independent,
mature adult tenant would.

32:55.498 --> 32:58.066
And just pretend
i'm someone else.

32:59.502 --> 33:01.369
All right.

33:01.371 --> 33:03.004
All right,
that makes sense.

33:03.006 --> 33:04.672
Oh, good!

33:04.674 --> 33:07.141
Last time i moved, i almost
misplaced frankie's baby teeth.

33:07.143 --> 33:09.043
okay.

33:09.045 --> 33:10.278
Well, thank you.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.981
Um, and i will expect
a check for $900

33:12.983 --> 33:14.248
On the first of the month.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.919
$900? Maura, it's a studio.

33:17.921 --> 33:19.320
It's beacon hill.

33:19.322 --> 33:21.456
Then i get kitchen privileges
in the main house.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.158
Fine, but i'll have to run
a full credit check.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.661
You wouldn't.
And i'll need
three references.

33:26.663 --> 33:28.596
What?! Three references?

33:28.598 --> 33:30.898
I have three references
for you --

33:30.900 --> 33:32.567
Burrata,

33:32.569 --> 33:34.402
Risotto,

33:34.404 --> 33:36.204
And cannoli.

33:36.206 --> 33:39.207
Bam! There's my three
references.

33:39.209 --> 33:41.042
Application accepted.

33:45.615 --> 33:47.215
Never thought i'd say this,

33:47.217 --> 33:49.517
But thank god
for street sweeping.

33:49.519 --> 33:51.619
Department of transportation
ticketed a blue outback

33:51.621 --> 33:53.621
On the victim's street
last month.

33:53.623 --> 33:55.223
Owner's name is leah moore.

33:55.225 --> 33:56.824
And get this --
she's a chemist.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.360
So she'd know how to cook meth.
And make bombs.

33:59.362 --> 34:01.462
She worked at
a lab testing company

34:01.464 --> 34:03.498
In the same building
as dr. Vela.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.167
So she could've known about
the illegal fat dump.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.202
Why didn't she show up
in the personnel records?

34:08.204 --> 34:10.071
Because leah moore was fired
a year ago

34:10.073 --> 34:11.372
After failing a drug test.

34:11.374 --> 34:13.241
Soon after, she was arrested
for possession

34:13.243 --> 34:15.043
And ordered to attend
narcotics anonymous

34:15.045 --> 34:18.179
At the same time robert hall's
parents told us he was in rehab.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.214
So maybe they decided to turn
that drug habit

34:20.216 --> 34:21.749
Into a drug business.

34:21.751 --> 34:24.652
Until hall decided he didn't
need her expertise anymore.

34:24.654 --> 34:26.921
And leah decided
she didn't need him.

34:26.923 --> 34:28.322
Boom. Fat bomb.

34:28.324 --> 34:31.426
Better get a team together
and get out there.

34:41.771 --> 34:44.672
Hey there.

34:44.674 --> 34:48.076
I'm gonna give you a chance
to apologize for yesterday.

34:48.078 --> 34:49.844
The pen dropping thing.

34:49.846 --> 34:51.846
It's called gravity.

34:51.848 --> 34:53.081
Don't flatter yourself.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.149
Gravity caused you
to wink at me?

35:01.691 --> 35:05.727
Do you think you're the first
man that tried to intimidate me?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.228
Penny williams, i am not.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.430
Who?
You remember her.

35:09.432 --> 35:11.299
She was the girl
that drove you nuts

35:11.301 --> 35:13.367
Because she wrote circles
around you.

35:13.369 --> 35:15.303
Penny williams.
Now i remember.
Yeah.

35:15.305 --> 35:16.671
Suicide, right?
Mm.

35:16.673 --> 35:19.941
tragic.
Not for you, though, huh?

35:19.943 --> 35:23.411
God, that must've<i>sucked</i>having
a girl be better than you.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.314
Just easier to get rid
of her, huh?

35:26.316 --> 35:30.251
You think
i murdered her? Wow.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.619
Who do you think you are,

35:31.621 --> 35:32.920
Coming here and making
an accusation like that?

35:32.922 --> 35:34.689
You seem awfully defensive.

35:34.691 --> 35:36.357
That's because penny was
a smug little brat

35:36.359 --> 35:37.859
Who would've gotten
more articles published

35:37.861 --> 35:41.329
If she'd bent over and picked up
my pen on occasion.

35:41.331 --> 35:42.897
But i didn't kill her.

35:42.899 --> 35:45.533
I know.

35:45.535 --> 35:48.269
Did you get all that,
agent davies?

35:49.572 --> 35:53.341
See, you accuse someone
of a crime they didn't commit,

35:53.343 --> 35:54.809
They often confess
to one they did.

35:54.811 --> 35:57.445
Should've paid more attention
in class.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.846
I didn't break any laws.

35:58.848 --> 36:01.816
No, being a misogynistic ass
is not illegal.

36:01.818 --> 36:04.685
But it is against
the fbi's code of conduct.

36:04.687 --> 36:07.922
You're through here,
mr. Graham.

36:07.924 --> 36:10.224
You stupid bitch!
That's enough.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.262
Nice work, rizzoli.
Thank you.

36:14.264 --> 36:17.064
We make a good team.
Team?

36:17.066 --> 36:19.567
Who gave you the microphone?

36:19.569 --> 36:20.802
What...

36:20.804 --> 36:23.738
Okay, yeah. I needed
the audio/vis-- whatever.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.107
After all this, i feel like
i owe you a drink.

36:27.277 --> 36:30.845
Oh, uh, uh, my flight leaves
in an hour, so...

36:30.847 --> 36:32.513
So what if it left in two?

36:35.251 --> 36:37.552
I am the fbi.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.977
The victim's meth lab
was brand-new,

36:45.979 --> 36:48.146
So there's a good chance
that this suspect's house

36:48.148 --> 36:49.715
Is another cook site.

36:49.717 --> 36:52.184
I've asked dr. Isles along
to help identify other dangers.

36:52.186 --> 36:54.853
Meth chemicals themselves are
just as explosive as a bomb.

36:54.855 --> 36:57.122
She'll be another set of eyes
inside.

36:57.124 --> 36:58.323
All right, let's move.

37:23.217 --> 37:25.283
Korsak, she's here.

37:44.238 --> 37:45.670
<i>Stop.</i>

37:45.672 --> 37:48.306
The cannister on the right
is red phosphorous.

37:48.308 --> 37:51.710
One spark, and the whole room
will be filled with toxic gas.

38:01.989 --> 38:04.923
Hey, frankie. Bet some
of big yao's in there.

38:06.860 --> 38:08.326
Huh?

38:19.973 --> 38:21.506
Stop!

38:21.508 --> 38:22.874
<i>It's leah moore. It's her!</i>

38:22.876 --> 38:25.510
<i>Where?</i>
Outside. She's running away.

38:26.613 --> 38:28.180
shit.

38:45.265 --> 38:46.865
She's running behind
the houses.

39:00.681 --> 39:03.949
stop!

39:05.719 --> 39:08.887
put it down, leah.

39:08.889 --> 39:11.456
Only 5% of pursuit suspects
escape.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.492
I'll take those odds.
Back off!

39:28.342 --> 39:30.008
Nice, maura. Nice. I got it.

39:30.010 --> 39:32.477
TouchÃ©, dr. Isles.

39:32.479 --> 39:34.779
You okay?
Yeah.

39:34.781 --> 39:36.214
whew.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.420
So you stabbed her?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.222
I didn't stab her.

39:44.224 --> 39:45.557
Frankie said
you stabbed her.

39:45.559 --> 39:48.493
It was just a parry.
But it was highly effective.

39:48.495 --> 39:50.629
Sometimes the best offense
is a good defense.

39:50.631 --> 39:52.631
Can i open my present now?

39:52.633 --> 39:56.034
And who am i to deny
the first person in 5,000 years

39:56.036 --> 39:58.236
To use fencing in combat?

39:58.238 --> 40:00.772
it hasn't
nearly been that long.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.374
You know,
in the revolutionary war,

40:02.376 --> 40:04.009
Sabres accounted
for 1/3 of the battle --

40:04.011 --> 40:05.677
Oh, my god.
Please open it.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.445
Okay.

40:09.983 --> 40:11.449
You didn't have to.

40:11.451 --> 40:15.120
Thank you for making me go.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.388
You happy you went
after all?

40:16.390 --> 40:17.822
I am. I really am.

40:17.824 --> 40:20.325
I-i was really happy to be
in that classroom.

40:20.327 --> 40:22.961
And i was just so proud of
the trainees, you know?

40:22.963 --> 40:26.097
And they just really made me
hopeful for the future.

40:26.099 --> 40:27.566
Oh, good.

40:29.069 --> 40:31.636
You didn't get this
from quantico, did you?

40:33.173 --> 40:34.606
Yes, i did.

40:38.845 --> 40:41.179
Oh, come on!

40:41.181 --> 40:42.647
Really?!

40:42.649 --> 40:45.650
I-i was in the airport,
and i was running late.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.587
But clearly,
i didn't look at it.

40:48.589 --> 40:51.122
It's okay.
It's the thought that counts.

40:51.124 --> 40:52.424
I -- no, you know what?

40:52.426 --> 40:54.225
This is exactly the kind of joke
that that jerk trainee

40:54.227 --> 40:56.361
Would love -- give it to me.
I'm throwing it away.

40:56.363 --> 40:59.097
No. No, no. No, i hate that.
I-i'll keep it. I'll just --

40:59.099 --> 41:02.067
I'll wear it underneath
my fencing uniform.

41:02.069 --> 41:05.904
You can't wear that.
Sure i can. I'll just
change the lettering.

41:05.906 --> 41:07.372
To what?

41:07.374 --> 41:09.307
Female...

41:09.309 --> 41:10.976
Tube inspector?

41:10.978 --> 41:13.445
What is that? What's -- what's
a female tube inspector?

41:13.447 --> 41:14.446
You know, i don't --
i don't wanna know.

41:14.448 --> 41:15.847
Just -- i'll throw it away.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.749
Okay, you know what? I think,
actually, this color,

41:17.751 --> 41:19.851
It looks a lot better on you,
so you can keep it.
