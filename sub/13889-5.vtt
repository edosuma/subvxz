01:54.899 --> 01:55.903
The post's arrived.

01:56.897 --> 01:57.901
Brilliant; a bit of excitement at last.

02:04.899 --> 02:09.535
Good, eh? It's a beaut. One of
the structured collepsed on m' bed.

02:09.836 --> 02:10.905
I think it was those beans.

02:11.908 --> 02:12.904
Oh, the mail.

02:18.901 --> 02:20.907
Haven't had a chance to
look. Anything from my mates?

02:21.994 --> 02:23.990
Something catastophic, hideous.

02:24.994 --> 02:27.994
He's found your guitar in Starbug's
wreckage and he's sending it here.

02:28.995 --> 02:29.991
Brilliant!

02:32.991 --> 02:33.953
Are you okay?

02:33.988 --> 02:36.016
Of course I'm not okay!
I hate your guitar!

02:36.017 --> 02:39.883
If I wanted to share a cell
with an irritating lump of wood

02:39.884 --> 02:41.495
I'd have moved in with
an Australian soap star.

02:45.020 --> 02:49.021
Hey-hey! The axe-man is back! You beaut!

02:55.614 --> 03:00.614
Hang on! There's no strings!
They've confiscated the strings!

03:05.613 --> 03:08.388
I feel like a man who leaps
out of a plane with no parachute

03:08.389 --> 03:10.617
and lands in the hot-tub
at the Playboy mansion.

03:12.612 --> 03:14.613
Why would they take my strings..?
It doesn't make sense...

03:15.611 --> 03:18.613
Prison regs. You're not allowed
anything you can hang yourself with.

03:19.612 --> 03:21.610
I wouldn't want to hang myself
if I had my guitar strings.

03:22.611 --> 03:23.615
I think they were thinking of me.

03:26.609 --> 03:28.613
Maybe my luck's changing...
at last, a break.

03:31.609 --> 03:33.611
Oh, by the way; I forgot: for you.

03:37.611 --> 03:39.522
"Because of the nature of your crime",

03:39.523 --> 03:42.491
blah - blah - blah - blah -
blah, whr - wh - wh - wh - wh,

03:42.492 --> 03:44.361
"we are willing to review your case"!

03:44.362 --> 03:48.320
"For this process to be successful you
would need a record of good behaviour,

03:48.321 --> 03:51.518
and accept the consequence that
a successful appeal would mean

03:51.519 --> 03:54.613
similar amnesty for prisoner
colleagues in your situation. "

03:55.609 --> 03:56.509
Yess!

04:01.751 --> 04:04.747
You don't know what it's like, being
classified as a woman, sir. The humiliation.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.751
I know, I know.

04:07.751 --> 04:12.027
I mean, why should I, a Series
4000 mechanoid, have to endure

04:12.028 --> 04:17.750
the turgid monotony of showering with the
girls? Three times a week! Tell me that!

04:17.786 --> 04:19.747
It's not fair, I know! It's just that -

04:26.203 --> 04:27.203
You shower with the girls?

04:28.201 --> 04:32.168
Oh! It's so hideously
dull I can't describe it,

04:32.169 --> 04:38.202
as they stand around soaping themselves.
Their bodies all wet and foamy.

04:45.198 --> 04:46.198
Can you imagine it?

04:51.197 --> 04:53.205
Oh my goodness, we've
been frozen in time again!

04:54.196 --> 04:56.198
Hello?

04:58.198 --> 05:01.954
Extraordinary! It must be a
warp in the time-space continuum!

05:03.155 --> 05:04.196
How curious it isn't affecting me...

05:13.047 --> 05:15.214
Oi, droid-boy, oi; next
time you're in the showers,

05:15.215 --> 05:17.173
why don't you... y'know...
smuggle in a camera

05:17.174 --> 05:19.048
and film 'em, eh? Yeah,
that'd be brilliant!

05:20.050 --> 05:24.050
Oi, I haven't seeen a naked
woman since... well, ever.

05:26.048 --> 05:28.050
Yeah, I'd pay you... wha'd'ya say?

05:29.050 --> 05:30.049
No, I forbid it!

05:31.048 --> 05:31.748
Yeah, me -

05:32.045 --> 05:33.044
What?

05:34.052 --> 05:37.009
It's voyeuristic,
exploitative, and immature.

05:37.044 --> 05:41.049
All right, who are you? And what
have you done with our Rimmer?

05:43.448 --> 05:46.216
Gentlemen, allow me to
clarify my position.

05:46.717 --> 05:50.715
Morally speaking, using a hidden
camera in the women's showers,

05:50.916 --> 05:56.968
taking shots of them sudding themselves with
mounds of foam, without their permission,

05:56.969 --> 06:01.515
morally speaking, I'm speaking
morally here, I'm all in favour!

06:03.716 --> 06:07.056
However, Listy has been invited to
appeal and a scam like this could ruin it.

06:08.061 --> 06:09.029
Appeal?

06:09.064 --> 06:10.061
Yeah, I'm appealing.

06:12.057 --> 06:13.063
That's a minority view.

06:15.057 --> 06:17.771
Look, if he's successful,
we can all be successful.

06:17.772 --> 06:19.062
We've just got to be model prisoners.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.057
Screw his appeal! I wanna see skin!

06:22.061 --> 06:24.056
Yeah! Wha'd'ya say, bird-tray head?

06:25.057 --> 06:27.333
Are you asking me to betray
the people I live with?

06:27.334 --> 06:30.223
To ignore their humanity and
reduce them to mindless sex objects,

06:30.224 --> 06:32.061
merely there for your
moronic titilation?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.055
Yes, please!

06:36.055 --> 06:38.060
If you'll excuse me, I
forgot who I was for a moment.

06:38.095 --> 06:39.021
Wait, what you doing?

06:39.056 --> 06:41.998
I'm a woman, and proud of
it. If you'll excuse me,

06:41.999 --> 06:45.056
I'll with my fellow sisters,
doing it for ourselves!

06:55.057 --> 06:57.057
I'm going to make this quick, and easy.

06:58.053 --> 07:02.053
Last night, on D-wing, I
was beaten up, and mugged.

07:07.080 --> 07:12.175
You have one chance. I'm going to turn
the lights off for precisely ten seconds,

07:12.176 --> 07:16.074
during which I want whover took
it... to return my glass eye.

07:22.774 --> 07:23.874
Kill the lights.

07:26.076 --> 07:30.079
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six -

07:36.077 --> 07:39.072
I'm glad to see good sense prevailed.

07:47.071 --> 07:52.324
I have a date with Miss Patricia
Carling from Supplies on Saturday night.

07:52.325 --> 07:58.073
She thinks my eyes are my best feature.
If I go like this, I'M ONLY HALF LOVELY!

08:01.075 --> 08:03.573
If it's not returned
within thirty seconds;

08:03.574 --> 08:06.070
all Canary priviliges
suspended. One month.

08:08.076 --> 08:09.078
I know who stole your left peeper, sir.

08:11.077 --> 08:14.071
It was him, sir. I saw him playing
marbles with it this morning, sir.

08:19.073 --> 08:20.073
Thank you, Rimmer.

08:28.070 --> 08:32.077
Have you gone mad? You don't rat on
other inmates, its an unwritten law.

08:33.071 --> 08:36.073
Look if it helps the appeal, what
else matters? 'Model prisoners'?

08:49.354 --> 08:52.358
Would the sky really fall in if
people just tidied up a little?

09:47.426 --> 09:51.624
Good evening. Tonight's scheduled
feature has been cancelled,

09:51.625 --> 09:55.281
and replaced with a special,
live, pay-per-view event

09:55.282 --> 09:57.989
brought to you courtesy of "Krytie TV"!

09:57.990 --> 10:00.968
Transmitting live via
my optical receptors,

10:00.969 --> 10:04.420
we bring you live, and
lithe, Womens Shower Night!

10:15.414 --> 10:19.413
Are they really gonna show this?
No way! This is a joke, right? This isn't-

10:23.417 --> 10:25.414
Oh, momma...

10:27.418 --> 10:28.417
You know what this means, don't you?

10:28.452 --> 10:29.413
There is a God?

10:31.413 --> 10:33.420
They got to him, they reprogrammed Kryten.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.412
If we get caught watching this
your appeal's dead in the water.

10:40.412 --> 10:41.415
Forget the appeal.

10:41.450 --> 10:42.418
I already have!

10:43.416 --> 10:46.418
What about Kris? She's never gonna
believe I wasn't involved in this!

10:46.453 --> 10:47.415
We've gotta stop it.

10:48.417 --> 10:49.417
You're right, I want no part of this.

10:50.413 --> 10:51.717
- Me neither.
- We've gotta go.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.620
Right now.

10:53.412 --> 10:54.415
Not a minute to lose.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.433
I'm dust.

10:55.468 --> 10:56.417
Me too.

10:57.415 --> 11:00.411
After two. One, two, go!

11:10.424 --> 11:13.414
And now, I'm gonna stare
at a cracked floor tile.

11:15.411 --> 11:16.411
What's he doing that for!?

11:17.414 --> 11:23.412
Remember, Shower Night is a pay-per-view
event. Start filling those buckets!

11:31.609 --> 11:33.983
I can't believe this, he's
running it like a business!

11:34.484 --> 11:36.416
There's even a bloke over
there selling ice-creams.

11:37.413 --> 11:40.412
Never mind him. Now.
We've gotta go, right now.

11:40.447 --> 11:41.408
I'm going, I'm going.

11:42.409 --> 11:44.462
But now, lets get up-close and personal

11:44.463 --> 11:47.409
with one of the shower-ees,
Miss Kristine Kochanski...

11:53.215 --> 11:54.215
Fancy a choc-ice?

12:05.411 --> 12:08.407
Okay; splendid. Later.

12:09.409 --> 12:11.406
Mister Kryten; visitor, sir.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.085
Kryten. Look, I know
Kill-Crazy's reprogrammed you;

12:19.086 --> 12:23.413
turned you into a ruthless entrepreneur,
but I think I know how to change you back.

12:24.408 --> 12:28.407
Well, keep it to yourself, sir.
I'll make it worth your while...

12:31.406 --> 12:32.377
Can't you see what it's done to you?

12:32.412 --> 12:34.150
It's made me rich, feared and respected.

12:34.151 --> 12:36.733
I'm loving every minute of
it! I've just bought the rights

12:36.734 --> 12:40.408
to the five-a-side soccer tournament today;
tomorrow, I'm hoping to get the boxing.

12:41.406 --> 12:45.409
Ahhhh, Miss Kochanski! Good to have you
back, I have a little gift for you...

12:46.105 --> 12:47.005
Ooh, another one?

12:47.403 --> 12:49.236
Nothing's too good for you, ma'am!

12:49.237 --> 12:53.147
You know you were worried about
picking up verrucas in the shower room?

12:53.148 --> 12:56.406
Well, I have the perfect
solution; a waterproof pogo stick.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.402
This has got to stop.

13:02.106 --> 13:06.132
But the pogo stick could put the
ratings through the roof, sir!

13:06.133 --> 13:08.402
Think of the money! Think of the show!

13:13.402 --> 13:16.401
I'm crazy about her! I'm
not gonna let you do this.

13:16.436 --> 13:17.405
Do what?

13:19.403 --> 13:20.403
How do you think Kryten got all this?

13:24.409 --> 13:27.405
"Shower Night Live". Oh God, is he
paying some of the girls to do this?

13:30.402 --> 13:31.403
Who's that with the sponge?

13:34.002 --> 13:34.902
That's me!

13:36.400 --> 13:38.863
It replaced the Wednesday night movie.

13:38.864 --> 13:43.401
I saw the whole thing; all three
terrible hours of it. It was awful.

13:44.405 --> 13:47.628
Is that the time? I've got a
merchandising meeting in two minutes.

13:47.629 --> 13:48.398
Heh, excuse me!

13:49.399 --> 13:51.404
You are dead, nickel-hydrate breath!

13:51.439 --> 13:52.364
And you!

13:52.399 --> 13:53.398
What have I done?

13:54.406 --> 13:55.400
You were there for three hours of it!

13:56.402 --> 13:58.470
Yeah, but I didn't
enjoy it! I was outraged.

13:59.671 --> 14:00.400
Why do you think I
only had one choc-ice?

14:02.404 --> 14:03.398
How could you go along with this?

14:04.398 --> 14:09.456
I'm only human. You were
completely naked, starkers, nude,

14:09.457 --> 14:13.400
in the buff, totally
kit-less, no clothes on!

14:14.402 --> 14:16.404
You've seen me with no
clothes on when we went out!

14:17.410 --> 14:19.400
Yeah, but, I wanted to see
if anything had changed.

14:21.401 --> 14:24.398
Why didn't you just ask,
instead of filming me in secret?

14:24.433 --> 14:25.396
Because you'll have said 'no'.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.877
Not necessarily. If I'd known
it meant that much to you,

14:29.878 --> 14:33.400
that you needed to see me naked so badly,
I wouldn't necessarily have said 'no'.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.399
You wouldn't?

14:37.396 --> 14:40.399
No. Well, we're friends aren't we?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.053
It never occured to me
that I could just ask.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.399
Oh, you're such a great friend.
I love being your friend.

14:50.394 --> 14:51.363
Kris..?

14:51.398 --> 14:54.393
No! Not now, and now, not ever!

14:55.401 --> 14:56.398
But you just said -

14:57.395 --> 14:58.397
We're not friends any more...

15:12.207 --> 15:14.243
The girls found out about Shower Night.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.357
They attacked me, cleaned out
my system and kicked me out.

15:17.358 --> 15:19.204
I've been reclassified as a man...

15:24.207 --> 15:27.202
I feel terrible, sir, for
endangering your appeal.

15:28.205 --> 15:30.205
It's not your fault,
Kryten, they got to you.

15:31.202 --> 15:33.201
I presume you've heard the
news about Miss Kochanski.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.207
What news?

15:35.205 --> 15:36.616
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

15:36.804 --> 15:38.170
- The news.
- What news?

15:38.205 --> 15:39.206
You haven't heard the news?

15:39.241 --> 15:40.222
Heard what news?

15:40.257 --> 15:41.203
No one's told you?

15:41.238 --> 15:42.167
Told me what?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.208
About Miss Kochanski?

15:44.206 --> 15:45.173
What about Miss Kochanski?

15:45.208 --> 15:47.167
About Miss Kochanski and
her ex-boyfriend, Tim.

15:47.202 --> 15:49.200
What about Miss Kochanski
and her ex-boyfriend, Tim?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.602
- I can't believe you don't know!
- Know what?

15:52.199 --> 15:53.200
No one told you?

15:53.235 --> 15:54.201
Told me what!?

15:55.206 --> 15:57.630
You mean to say that you're standing
there blissfully unaware of the news

15:57.631 --> 15:59.203
about Miss Kochanski and
her ex-boyfriend, Tim?

15:59.238 --> 16:01.200
What news about Miss Kochanski
and her ex-boyfriend, Tim!?

16:02.206 --> 16:04.168
- I don't believe it.
- Believe what!?

16:04.203 --> 16:07.594
Psh, tsk, I'm so traumatised no
one's had the guts to tell you

16:07.595 --> 16:11.201
the horrible, terrible, terrible,
appallingly hideous, awful news!

16:13.200 --> 16:14.203
I'm not sure I can even speak now.

16:15.207 --> 16:19.163
Kryten, there's a two hundred foot
drop down there; now tell me the news.

16:19.198 --> 16:21.063
Well, she's started
going out with Tim again.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.968
He's taking her to the
Officer's Club tonight.

16:22.969 --> 16:25.197
Her probation permits it,
providing she's back by ten.

16:26.204 --> 16:28.196
Ohhh. This is all down to
that shower thing, isn't it?

16:29.196 --> 16:33.196
You know what Tim's like,
sir. Impossibly handsome,

16:33.197 --> 16:37.196
oozes charm, a great lover.
And you're just... you.

16:39.203 --> 16:41.198
It's so unfair!

16:43.200 --> 16:44.199
You must feel awful.

16:45.197 --> 16:48.160
Well I do now! God!

16:48.195 --> 16:50.195
You're taking this very well,
sir. I... I'm really impressed.

16:51.197 --> 16:52.204
No I'm not, man, I'm falling apart.

16:53.201 --> 16:55.198
I know that, but I was
just trying to cheer you up!

17:03.197 --> 17:04.199
What can I do?

17:05.202 --> 17:07.462
You've gotta deal with your grief, man.

17:07.463 --> 17:09.805
Breakup is very much like a bereavement:

17:09.806 --> 17:13.200
its usually followed by a
cremation and some sandwiches.

17:15.253 --> 17:17.467
Look, they haven't seen
each other for ages;

17:17.468 --> 17:19.138
they're only going out for a meal.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.252
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

17:22.862 --> 17:23.962
It's a tragedy.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.230
What are you so bothered about?

17:26.231 --> 17:28.262
I thought you hated the idea of
me and her getting it together?

17:29.254 --> 17:32.143
That was the old me, sir. I've
grown and matured since then.

17:32.144 --> 17:36.264
No, the new me wants you to have children
so I can iron those itty-bitty little socks!

17:38.254 --> 17:41.825
And you're not getting any younger,
sir, and neither are your sperms.

17:42.426 --> 17:43.876
I'm getting worried about those guys.

17:44.577 --> 17:48.254
Any older and they'll need a Stanner
stairlift to get up the fallopian tubes!

17:52.255 --> 17:53.220
So what do you propose?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.687
We nail that horny stag and get
you and the divine Miss K together.

17:57.088 --> 17:58.252
It's my way of saying 'sorry'.

17:59.253 --> 18:00.258
But nothing that's going
to endanger the appeal...

18:01.265 --> 18:03.230
First, we sabotage the date.

18:03.265 --> 18:05.263
What, 'we'? You mean you're gonna help me?

18:06.260 --> 18:08.262
Step on board the 'love express', sir!

18:09.267 --> 18:11.979
Now, we get to his quarters
through the air vents;

18:12.480 --> 18:15.808
I've paid off the guards. Then you
make him look like the nerdiest slob

18:15.809 --> 18:19.263
in the entire universe: this is
what you leave in his quarters -

18:20.268 --> 18:24.266
a half-eaten onion sandwich.
That's always a passion-killer.

18:25.268 --> 18:27.260
Is it? I like those.

18:29.259 --> 18:32.339
Then there's this:
"Morris Dancer Monthly".

18:33.840 --> 18:36.260
What a total dweebo, nerdmeister
he'll look with those!

18:38.264 --> 18:39.258
They're mine!

18:43.259 --> 18:47.258
And then there's these: tragically
unfashionable underpants.

18:48.262 --> 18:49.263
They're mine!

18:51.265 --> 18:55.262
And finally: Christian rock music. It
that doesn't scare her off, nothing will.

18:57.258 --> 18:58.257
Have you been going through my things?

19:00.858 --> 19:02.058
And not forgetting...

19:03.756 --> 19:04.856
A pair of scissors?

19:05.263 --> 19:06.263
This is the piece de resistence...

19:27.256 --> 19:29.255
"Frank Acissi and the
Apostles" - "Hyms in Rock" -

19:42.253 --> 19:43.260
Some digestive biscuit...

20:25.257 --> 20:26.257
The love assassin...

20:41.251 --> 20:44.256
What Mister Lister doesn't know, of
course, is he's been set up by Krytie TV!

20:48.254 --> 20:49.256
Shh! Here he comes now!

20:52.256 --> 20:53.251
Mister Lister!

20:53.753 --> 20:54.953
Kryten, is that you?

20:55.252 --> 20:57.250
You trashed that room
because you believed

20:57.251 --> 20:59.248
Miss Kochanski was
dating Tim, didn't you?

20:59.283 --> 21:00.258
What, you mean she isn't?

21:01.253 --> 21:02.256
Look who's quarters you really trashed...

21:10.250 --> 21:12.248
You said the girls had
restored you back to normal!

21:13.250 --> 21:15.250
Whoops! You've been Krytered!

21:17.248 --> 21:18.249
I've wrecked Ackerman's quarters!

21:19.253 --> 21:20.250
THE APPEAL!

21:22.323 --> 21:25.495
But the surprises haven't
finished yet, here on Krytie TV,

21:25.496 --> 21:29.259
because Mister Ackerman and his red
hot date are due back any second.

21:29.260 --> 21:32.324
Sir, it's a race against time!
Start cleaning that room!

21:38.323 --> 21:42.322
Sorry to keep droning on about
this, but what about THE APPEAL!

21:43.326 --> 21:44.326
Smeg!

21:53.326 --> 21:54.331
Oh smeg..!

22:42.596 --> 22:43.597
Thanks for watching,
folks; see you next time!

22:44.600 --> 22:45.595
There he is!

22:46.595 --> 22:47.566
Kryten, come here a minute...

22:47.601 --> 22:48.598
I was just trying to boost the ratings, sir!

22:50.595 --> 22:51.594
Get him, and bring him back to the Tank!

22:52.299 --> 22:53.299
It was nothing personal!

23:02.141 --> 23:03.141
The appeal.

23:05.343 --> 23:10.342
Oooohhhhh... YES!

23:12.347 --> 23:14.344
"Dear Mister Lister, your
appeal has been successful"!

23:15.345 --> 23:18.760
"From this day forth all inmates with
no record of violence or depression

23:18.761 --> 23:21.345
will be allowed... to have
strings on their guitars"...

23:30.347 --> 23:32.347
This appeal was all about guitar strings?

23:33.344 --> 23:34.339
You didn't think it was about
getting out of here, did you?

23:36.740 --> 23:38.515
You mean to say I've
been busting my balls

23:38.516 --> 23:41.347
so you can have strings on
your lousy, stinking guitar?

23:42.342 --> 23:46.100
You've been a brick, man.
And as a personal 'thank you',

23:46.601 --> 23:48.341
I thought I'd write you a song...

23:49.305 --> 23:55.805
