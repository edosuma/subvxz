MORE MODERN FACILITIES

01:33.136 --> 01:35.138
IN YOUR TRAVELS, BUT, UH--

01:35.138 --> 01:38.881
GRIFFIN.
DON'T COME IN HERE.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.317
DR. SEBERG, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:45.235 --> 01:47.107
OH, MY GOD.

01:55.158 --> 01:58.030
[shoes shuffling]

02:04.341 --> 02:06.735
HEY.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.432
HEY.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.913
CHEER UP.WHY?

02:10.913 --> 02:13.045
UH, 'CAUSE IT'S BETTER
TO BE HAPPY THAN SAD.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.831
I'M NOT SAD.YOU'RE VERY SAD.

02:15.831 --> 02:19.487
YOU'VE BEEN SAD FOR MONTHS,
EVER SINCE, UH--WHAT, IS THIS SOME SORT
OF THERAPY SESSION?

02:19.487 --> 02:22.098
DID YOU BRING TISSUE
IN CASE YOU MAKE ME CRY?

02:22.098 --> 02:24.666
THERE WE GO. ZING OF ANGER--
GETS THE BLOOD UP.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.712
THAT'S A GOOD START.IS THIS WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR--
TO ZING ME?

02:27.712 --> 02:31.151
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
PAPERWORK TO DO.JANE, CALL FOR YOU. THEY SAY
IT'S EXTREMELY URGENT. LINE TWO.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.457
OOH.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.067
[picks up telephone receiver]

02:35.067 --> 02:37.157
[clears throat]
THIS IS JANE.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.159
[woman] Good morning, Mr. Jane.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.118
MY NAME IS DR. ALICIA SEBERG.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.512
I GATHER FROM A BRIEF SEARCH
ON THE INTERNET

02:44.512 --> 02:46.601
THAT YOU'RE THE BEST DETECTIVE
IN MY IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.429
OH. WELL, UM...

02:48.429 --> 02:52.302
YOU FLATTER ME, BUT, UH,
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A DETECTIVE.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.651
I NEED
YOUR PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.175
Please come immediately.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.828
I'VE BEEN MURDERED.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.886
[helicopter whirring]

03:34.953 --> 03:36.520
WHOO!

03:38.827 --> 03:41.656
THAT WAS FUN!

03:41.656 --> 03:43.397
[Patrick] WHOO!

03:43.397 --> 03:47.444
AGENT LISBON! CBI!

03:47.444 --> 03:49.664
MA'AM, SIR,
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.

03:49.664 --> 03:50.882
ALL RIGHT!

03:50.882 --> 03:53.842
AGENT LISBON.
AND YOU ARE...

03:53.842 --> 03:55.757
I'M THIS GUY--
PATRICK JANE. CONSULTANT?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.673
OKAY, TERESA, PATRICK,
GLAD TO MEET YOU BOTH.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.284
I'M DEAN HARKEN, CALIFORNIA
DISEASE CONTROL AUTHORITY.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.591
NICE TO MEET YOU.YEAH, WE HAVE

04:03.591 --> 04:05.941
A POTENTIAL CODE RED
VIRUS OUTBREAK SITUATION HERE.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.726
THIS FACILITY
IS UNDER C.D.C.A. CONTROL,

04:08.726 --> 04:10.859
AS PER
STATE EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.818
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MIGHT DIE IF
WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT, OKAY?

04:13.818 --> 04:16.778
WE'VE BEEN APPRISED
OF THE BASIC--NOW SHE'S DENYING IT, OF COURSE,
BUT THIS SITUATION'S

04:16.778 --> 04:18.432
ALMOST CERTAINLY RESULTED
FROM AN ERROR BY DR. SEBERG.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.912
THERE'S NO CRIMINALITY
INVOLVED,

04:20.912 --> 04:23.915
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY
NEEDED HERE.PROBABLY,
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE--

04:23.915 --> 04:26.701
AS A PROFESSIONAL COURTESY, I'M
GONNA LET YOU INTO THE FACILITY.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.181
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS
TO OBSERVE AND GATHER EVIDENCE,

04:29.181 --> 04:32.184
AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER
THAT C.D.C.A. IS BIG DOG HERE.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.187
OUR INVESTIGATION HAS PRIORITY.
NOW ARE WE COOL WITH THAT?

04:35.187 --> 04:36.319
ABSOLUTELY.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.539
CAN I SEE
YOUR I.D. ALSO?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.628
SURE.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.937
THANK YOU... DEAN.

04:45.937 --> 04:49.724
NO PICTURE. THAT'S A SHAME.
YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING MAN.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.204
SCOTT PRICE,
I MANAGE THIS FACILITY

04:52.204 --> 04:53.815
FOR ZITEK
BIOSYSTEMS DIVISION.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.512
RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
LET ME ASSURE YOU

04:55.512 --> 04:58.907
THAT WE AS A COMPANY ARE
110% COMMITTED TO GIVING YOU

04:58.907 --> 05:02.389
THE BEST POSSIBLE COOPERATION.THANK YOU, MR. PRICE. SHALL WE?
THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY HERE.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.696
AH, YES, OF COURSE.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.046
LISBON, JANE, DR. EDMUNDS,
HEAD OF RESEARCH HERE.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.048
HE'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE RELEASE INCIDENT.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.790
PRICE, COME WITH ME.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.792
THANK YOU FOR COMING
SO QUICKLY.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.186
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT YOU DO HERE?

05:17.186 --> 05:18.796
BIOWARFARE.
WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY,

05:18.796 --> 05:21.321
ANTHRAX, BOTULISM,
BUBONIC PLAGUE,

05:21.321 --> 05:24.106
EVEN COBRA VENOM ALL HAVE
STRONG WEAPONIZING POTENTIAL.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.761
IT'S A GROWING FIELD.
A LOT OF EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.329
YOU DEVELOP WAYS OF KILLING
PEOPLE IN LARGE NUMBERS.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.722
TO THE CONTRARY. WE DEVELOP
ANTIDOTES, WAYS TO COMBAT

05:31.722 --> 05:33.855
THE THINGS THAT KILL
LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.465
HERE WE ARE.

05:35.465 --> 05:39.817
[computer whirring]

05:39.817 --> 05:41.210
[beeps]

05:41.210 --> 05:42.690
[door unlocks]FOLLOW ME.

05:45.606 --> 05:48.086
120.

05:48.086 --> 05:51.568
DARLING. IS THIS MR. JANE?

05:51.568 --> 05:54.397
YES. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?THE SAME.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
INTERESTING IMPROVEMENT
IN CARDIAC RATE, THOUGH.

05:56.399 --> 06:00.055
MY METABOLISM'S TRYING TO
FIGHT BACK WITH ADRENALINE.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.100
GOOD MORNING, MR. JANE.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.972
HI.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.756
AGENT LISBON, CBI.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.891
YOU MIND WRITING THIS DOWN
FOR US?

06:09.891 --> 06:13.851
SOMEONE OPENED THIS FLASK
AND LEFT IT UNDER THE TANK.

06:13.851 --> 06:17.072
IT CONTAINS AN AIRBORNE FORM
OF CRYPTOHANSA B STRAIN.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.379
IT'S
AN ENGINEERED SUPERVIRUS.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.120
IF IT ESCAPED FROM THIS ROOM,
IT WOULD KILL

06:22.120 --> 06:24.558
EVERY VERTEBRATE CREATURE
WITHIN A QUARTER-MILE RADIUS.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.648
IT ATTACKS THE RED BLOOD CELLS,
GRADUALLY STOPS THEM

06:27.648 --> 06:29.693
FROM DELIVERING OXYGEN.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.956
THE VICTIM... DIES FROM
SUFFOCATION OR A HEART ATTACK,

06:31.956 --> 06:34.089
DEPENDING ON
THEIR PHYSICAL CONDITION.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.873
HOW LONG AFTER EXPOSURE?

06:35.873 --> 06:38.615
WE ESTIMATE ANYWHERE
FROM TWO TO SIX HOURS.

06:38.615 --> 06:42.750
SO YOU COULD DIE AT ANY TIME?YES.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.361
HARKEN SAYS YOU DID THIS
YOURSELF--TRAGIC ERROR.

06:45.361 --> 06:48.364
HE'S A BUREAUCRAT. HE'S LOOKING
FOR THE EASY ANSWER.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.845
IT TAKES FOUR DISTINCT STEPS
TO REMOVE A CAP

06:50.845 --> 06:53.804
FROM ONE OF THESE FLASKS,
AND WE NEVER OPEN A FLASK

06:53.804 --> 06:56.154
OUTSIDE OF THE TANK.
THAT'S JUST BASIC.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.028
I CAN ASSURE YOU BOTH,
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

07:00.028 --> 07:03.335
BUT THIS WAS NO MISTAKE.
WHOEVER DID THIS WANTED ME DEAD.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.642
EVERYBODY KNOWS I TAKE
THE FIRST SHIFT.

07:05.642 --> 07:08.906
SHE CALLED YOU "DARLING."
YOU BOTH HAVE WEDDING BANDS.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.778
YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE?

07:10.778 --> 07:12.519
YES.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.957
WELL, SHE LOOKS SURPRISED

07:15.957 --> 07:18.786
BECAUSE YOU SEEM
INCREDIBLY CALM AND COOL

07:18.786 --> 07:20.657
FOR A MAN WHOSE WIFE
IS DYING.

07:20.657 --> 07:24.139
HOW WOULD AN ABSENCE OF CALM
AND COOL BE USEFUL TO HER?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.271
GOOD POINT.
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

07:26.271 --> 07:28.448
BUT FOR THE KILLER TO OPEN
THE FLASK,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.798
THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXPOSE
THEMSELVES TO THE VIRUS,

07:30.798 --> 07:34.149
IN WHICH CASE, THEY WOULD BE
DYING OR POSSIBLY DEAD ALREADY.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.630
NO, THERE'S AN ANTIDOTE.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.675
IT'S AN ENZYME COMPOUND.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.635
IF TAKEN BEFORE EXPOSURE,
IT PREVENTS INFECTION.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.985
I ASSUME WHOEVER DID THIS
TOOK A DOSE.

07:43.985 --> 07:47.336
COULDN'T YOU J--NO, I CAN'T TAKE IT NOW.

07:47.336 --> 07:51.209
THE ANTIDOTE ONLY WORKS IF TAKEN
BEFOREEXPOSURE, AS I SAID.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.951
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE IT BEFORE,
JUST AS A PRECAUTION?

07:53.951 --> 07:57.128
THE SIDE EFFECTS OF REGULAR USE
ARE FAR TOO SEVERE.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.217
WHO ELSE HAD ACCESS
TO THE VIRUS FLASK?

07:59.217 --> 08:01.698
THE ONLY PEOPLE ALLOWED
IN THE LAB ARE CLIFF AND I,

08:01.698 --> 08:04.135
WELKS, NASH AND TRIPP,
OUR COLLEAGUES.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.616
WE HAVE A STATE-OF-THE-ART
BIOMETRIC SECURITY SYSTEM,

08:06.616 --> 08:08.096
AS YOU CAN SEE.

08:08.096 --> 08:11.055
SO YOUR HUSBAND
OR ONE OF THE THREE COLLEAGUES

08:11.055 --> 08:12.883
IS THE KILLER.

08:14.319 --> 08:17.497
SORRY. UH, WILLBE THE KILLER.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.281
JANE.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.412
I'M JUST... MM.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.374
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT IS
THE UNAVOIDABLE CONCLUSION.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.028
YES.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.596
WHERE ARE
THE OTHER THREE NOW?

08:29.596 --> 08:33.034
HARKEN IS HAVING THEM
FILL OUT AN ACCIDENT REPORT.WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEAK
TO THEM.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.471
OOH, THIS IS
A GOOD ONE, EH?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.299
GOOD?

08:37.299 --> 08:39.562
WELL, INTERESTING. UNIQUE.

08:39.562 --> 08:43.566
IF YOU'RE A JADED, GHOULISH
ADVENTURE SEEKER.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.960
GHOULISH? LISTEN, IF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA KILL EACH OTHER

08:45.960 --> 08:48.571
AND WE HAVE TO CATCH THEM,
I WOULD MUCH RATHER

08:48.571 --> 08:50.921
THEY GO ABOUT IT WITH
SOME KIND OF ORIGINALITY.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.749
[Van Pelt] Boss?HEY, VAN PELT.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.143
I need you to do background
checks on Cliff Edmunds...

08:55.143 --> 08:58.102
[speaking indistinctly]LILITH NASH,
GRIFFIN LATIMER WELKS,

08:58.102 --> 08:59.800
Florian Eric Tripp.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.497
I'm sending you
their details now.

09:01.497 --> 09:04.500
ANYTHING TO BE
LOOKING OUT FOR IN PARTICULAR?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.763
OH, UH, ONE OF THEM RELEASED
A LETHAL SUPERVIRUS

09:06.763 --> 09:08.504
THAT COULD KILL HALF
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

09:08.504 --> 09:10.201
so I guess we're looking for

09:10.201 --> 09:12.900
someone with a prior background
as an evil supervillain.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.292
OKAY.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.689
THAT LAST PART WAS A JOKE.YEAH, WE GET IT.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.951
Later.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.006
HELLO.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.224
HI.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.530
HELLO.HELLO.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.580
[clears throat]

09:42.190 --> 09:44.975
[sighs deeply]

09:44.975 --> 09:48.196
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

09:48.196 --> 09:52.722
TRYING TO MAKE US NERVOUS?CORRECT. HOW AM I DOING?

09:52.722 --> 09:55.116
DOING WELL.EXCELLENT.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.292
BUT WHY?

09:57.292 --> 10:00.034
ONE OF YOU THREE
MURDERED ALICIA SEBERG,

10:00.034 --> 10:04.038
OR HER HUSBAND DID.
IT'S OUR JOB TO FIND OUT WHO.AND WE'RE IN A HURRY,

10:04.038 --> 10:08.129
AND NERVOUS PEOPLE
ARE EASY TO READ.AND WHAT DO YOU GATHER
FROM ALL THIS READING?

10:08.129 --> 10:10.218
WELL, YOU'RE AN OPEN BOOK.
YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT

10:10.218 --> 10:12.742
YOU SEEM TO BE--
A STRAIGHT ARROW, A BOY SCOUT.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.527
AM I RIGHT?NO.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.400
I'M WRONG.
THERE'S A HIDDEN SIDE TO YOU.YES, BUT--

10:18.400 --> 10:20.532
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?NOTHING.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.665
WHAT IS HE HIDING, LILITH?I DON'T KNOW.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.232
WHAT ARE YOUHIDING?I-I'M NOT--

10:24.232 --> 10:25.799
IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?ME WHAT?

10:25.799 --> 10:28.715
YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ALICIA SEBERG.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.934
WHAT? NO, NOT WITH ME.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.764
NOT WITH YOU.
WITH WHO, THEN?

10:34.764 --> 10:36.766
I OVERSEE EQUIPMENT
AND INVENTORY,

10:36.766 --> 10:38.899
NOT MY COLLEAGUES'
PRIVATE LIVES.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.770
BUT SHE WASHAVING
AN AFFAIR, HUH?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.773
WHY ELSE WOULD A HUSBAND
HAVE THE MOTIVES TO KILL HER?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.733
AND IF IT WASN'T HER HUSBAND,
IT WAS ONE OF YOU.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.256
WHO WAS IT?

10:51.868 --> 10:53.565
MY GUESS...

10:55.655 --> 10:57.613
KASEEM.[knocks on table]

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702
YES.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.486
DOES HER HUSBAND KNOW?OH, HE KNOWS.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.097
DR. EDMUNDS IS

11:03.097 --> 11:05.665
A KIND, GENTLE MAN.
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.319
THANK YOU, LILITH, FLORIAN...

11:08.319 --> 11:09.756
GRIFFIN.

11:19.069 --> 11:22.377
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR

11:22.377 --> 11:25.075
WITH DR. KASEEM HERE?BECAUSE IT ISN'T RELEVANT.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.643
YEAH, WE HAVE
AN HONEST AND OPEN MARRIAGE.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.949
THEY DO.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.777
REALLY?
YOU DON'T MIND?

11:30.777 --> 11:32.692
[Edmunds]
NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.519
FIDELITY IS SIMPLY
A CULTURAL CONVENTION.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.044
LIKE CLOTHES
AND NOT KILLING PEOPLE.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.263
YOU COULD SAY SO.

11:39.263 --> 11:42.658
COME ON.
IT MUST BUG YOU A LITTLE.

11:42.658 --> 11:47.184
NO. WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
HER HAPPINESS IS MINE.

11:47.184 --> 11:50.405
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T HAVE
AFFAIRS MYSELF.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.060
ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
PRESENTLY?

11:53.060 --> 11:55.584
NO. I'VE BEEN FAR TOO BUSY.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.500
Y-YOU MUST THINK
THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

11:58.500 --> 12:02.722
UH... YEAH... AT FIRST.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.549
BUT HEY. [chuckles]

12:04.549 --> 12:05.942
BUT HEY. [chuckles]

12:05.942 --> 12:09.163
WHAT AN ELOQUENT PHRASE
THAT IS.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.688
[telephone rings]

12:12.688 --> 12:15.038
OH! ISABEL. THANK GOD.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.474
[ring]

12:16.474 --> 12:17.562
[ring]

12:17.562 --> 12:21.741
[choking][ring]

12:21.741 --> 12:25.701
Mom?
Mom, I got Dad's message.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.616
[mouths words] Is it true?

12:27.616 --> 12:29.009
YES, IT'S TRUE.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.880
[crying] No.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.534
No, no, it can't be!

12:32.534 --> 12:34.536
OH, THIS IS A PICKLE,
ISN'T IT?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.974
[crying] OH, BABY, DON'T CRY.
DON'T CRY.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.977
[continues crying] How can you
tell me not to cry?

12:40.977 --> 12:44.720
Of course I'm going to cry.
Is there something you can do?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.376
There has to be something!

12:48.376 --> 12:50.552
LISTEN TO ME.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.554
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME,

12:52.554 --> 12:55.339
SO WE MUSTN'T WASTE IT
WEEPING AND WAILING, OKAY?

12:55.339 --> 12:57.080
Okay.GOOD.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.781
HOW'S SCHOOL GOING? DID YOU GET
YOUR CALCULUS GRADE UP?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.348
I got a 95 on my last test.

13:04.348 --> 13:07.787
OH, WELL DONE.
YOU KEEP THAT UP.

13:07.787 --> 13:12.052
A-AND WHAT ABOUT THAT BOY, ANDY?
HOW'S THAT GOING?

13:12.052 --> 13:15.751
Oh, he's a jerk. [sniffles]
I don't see him anymore.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.362
WELL, I MUST SAY,
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.625
I DIDN'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF HIM.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.324
[coughs]

13:23.324 --> 13:26.414
[choking]

13:26.414 --> 13:28.808
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.637
[whispers] YOU'RE THE BEST THING
I EVER DID.

13:32.637 --> 13:36.685
AND I AM SO... PROUD OF YOU.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.253
[crying] Mom.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.776
SHH, SHH, SHH!

13:40.776 --> 13:43.344
WHEN I'M GONE,

13:43.344 --> 13:46.347
YOU MUSTN'T WASTE TIME
BEING SAD.

13:46.347 --> 13:50.699
A LITTLE WHILE IS OKAY,
BUT NOT TOO LONG.

13:50.699 --> 13:54.398
YOU BE BRAVE.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.487
AND BE HAPPY.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.099
[crying]

13:59.099 --> 14:01.623
BYE, BABY.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.234

14:04.234 --> 14:06.280
Mom!BYE, BABY.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.803

GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.854
I LOVE YOU, DARLING.
GOOD-BYE.

[chokes]

14:27.301 --> 14:31.609
[sobbing]

14:31.609 --> 14:33.394
SHE'S GONE, BABY.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.004
SHE'S GONE.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.877
[continues sobbing]

14:44.796 --> 14:48.757
[indistinct conversations]

14:48.757 --> 14:50.063
SHE'S DEAD?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.629
[Lisbon] YES.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.024
I'M, UH...

14:57.026 --> 14:59.072
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.730
MY PEOPLE AND I WILL GET PREPPED

15:05.730 --> 15:09.256
FOR THE DECONTAMINATION
PROCEDURE.HOW DOES THAT WORK?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.780
IT'S A LOW-INTENSITY
MICRO-RADIATION BATH

15:11.780 --> 15:13.782
BUILT IN FOR THIS EVENTUALITY.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.045
THE CHAMBER IS IRRADIATED.
THE VIRUS IS DESTROYED.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.526
ALICIA'S BODY'S NOT HARMED.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.529
HOW LONG UNTIL WE CAN EXAMINE
THE CRIME SCENE?WHOA.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.879
IT'S NOT A CRIME SCENE UNTIL
YOU KNOW THERE'S A CRIME, RIGHT?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.968
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
THERE'S BEEN A MURDER HERE.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.579
WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE?ALICIA'S SEBERG'S WORD.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.408
WHY WOULD SHE LIE?SHE HAD A BRAIN FREEZE.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.497
SHE SCREWED UP,
AND SHE CAN'T ADMIT THE FACT.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.413
IT HAPPENS. I'VE BEEN WORKING
THIS BEAT FOR A LONG TIME.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.286
I'VE SEEN THE SAME DENIAL,
SAME CERTAINTY.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.462
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.I DISAGREE. I BELIEVE HER.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.290
I'M CALLING THIS IN
AS A HOMICIDE.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.335
AND I'M SORRY IF THIS
COMPLICATES YOUR WORK,

15:45.335 --> 15:48.425
BUT IT'S MY JOB.THAT'S FINE. OKAY.
DOING YOUR JOB.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.471
BUT THIS IS STILL
A LIVE OUTBREAK,

15:50.471 --> 15:53.691
AND I'M IN CHARGE HERE.
YOU WANNA MAKE A MURDER CASE,

15:53.691 --> 15:57.826
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE SUSPECTS
AS PER C.D.C.A. PROTOCOLS.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.306
ABSOLUTELY.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.835
[Van Pelt]
UNTIL THE SUMMER OF '08,

16:06.835 --> 16:09.969
SEBERG, EDMUNDS, NASH AND TRIPP
ALL WORKED TOGETHER

16:09.969 --> 16:12.275
AT THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE

16:12.275 --> 16:14.277
BIOCHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT.[clicking keys]

16:14.277 --> 16:16.323
SEBERG AND EDMUNDS
LEFT ABRUPTLY--

16:16.323 --> 16:18.325
SOME KIND OF LEGAL DISPUTE.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.370
OKAY, CHO AND I
WILL CHECK IT OUT.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.633
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CONVICTED
OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.070
NO.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.942
ARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN A MEMBER

16:26.942 --> 16:28.726
OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION?THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.860
THIS ISRIDICULOUS.[lowered voice]
JUST LET IT GO.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.818
LET'S HAVE SOME QUIET
BACK THERE, HUH?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.476
NOW, MR. TRIPP, PLEASE--WHY?

16:39.476 --> 16:41.261
WHY?

16:41.261 --> 16:43.741
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES OUR SILENCE MAKE?

16:43.741 --> 16:46.875
SILENT OR NOT, YOU'RE STILL
WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME

16:46.875 --> 16:49.965
WITH THIS NONSENSE.YOU GUYS CALLED THIS HOMICIDE,
SO NOW WE HAVE

16:49.965 --> 16:52.750
TO RUN THE PAPERWORK.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.STILL A WASTE OF TIME.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.884
I THOUGHT I MADE THE DEAL
CLEAR TO YOU GUYS.

16:55.884 --> 16:59.975
YOU REALLY WANNA MESS
WITH THE C.D.C.A.?ABSOLUTELY NOT. I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY COLLEAGUE'S RUDENESS--

16:59.975 --> 17:01.803
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
I RETRACT THAT APOLOGY.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.545
SHOW SOME METTLE, LISBON.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO,

17:04.545 --> 17:07.200
IF I HAVE TEN MINUTES
WITH THESE PEOPLE,

17:07.200 --> 17:11.291
I WILL GET THE TRUTH, IF THERE'S
ANY USEFUL TRUTH WORTH HAVING.EXCUSE US. [mouths word]

17:11.291 --> 17:14.511
YES, EXCUSE US.
WE HAVE TO HAVE A CHAT.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.212
[lowers voice] COOL IT,
ALL RIGHT? THAT IS AN ORDER.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.823
[lowers voice] OKAY. JUST RELAX.
I'M WORKING THE CASE.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.826
LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.MM-HMM.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.871
THIS IS POLITICS.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.004
THE C.D.C.A. IS RICH,
MEAN AND WELL CONNECTED.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.311
THE CBI IN COMPARISON
ARE LIKE POOR ORPHANS.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.400
WE CAN'T MAKE ENEMIES
OUT OF THEM.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.402
WE NEED TO COOPERATE
WITH THIS MAN.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.448
HE IRKS ME.SAY IT. "I UNDERSTAND."

17:38.448 --> 17:40.842
HMM. [mutters]

17:40.842 --> 17:43.279
GO. FIND YOURSELF
A VENDING MACHINE.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.977
BUY YOURSELF A CANDY BAR
AND COME BACK

17:45.977 --> 17:49.111
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO PLAY NICE.GIVE ME A DOLLAR AND I WILL.

17:49.111 --> 17:52.506
[bill crinkling]

17:54.029 --> 17:55.639
YOU'RE PAYING ME BACK.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.039
CARRY ON.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.737
[man] OH, MY LORD.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

18:06.737 --> 18:10.611
AND YOU SUSPECT FOUL PLAY
OF SOME KIND?[Cho] UH, PROFESSOR,
DR. SEBERG AND HER HUSBAND

18:10.611 --> 18:12.482
WORKED HERE AT THE INSTITUTE
UNTIL '08,

18:12.482 --> 18:15.137
AS DID FLORIAN TRIPP
AND LILITH NASH.

18:15.137 --> 18:19.010
IS THAT CORRECT?YES. BRILLIANT RESEARCH TEAM.
WE WERE VERY SORRY TO LOSE THEM.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.013
MONEY, YOU KNOW? WE TRIED
TO HOLD THEM TO THEIR CONTRACT,

18:22.013 --> 18:24.146
BUT ZITEK THREATENED
A LAWSUIT,

18:24.146 --> 18:26.540
SO THEY LEFT
RATHER UNDER A CLOUD.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.804
BUT EDMUNDS AND SEBERG
AS A COUPLE--DID THEY GET ALONG?OH, I THINK SO, DESPITE ALL.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.285
DESPITE ALL WHAT?

18:32.285 --> 18:35.244
WELL, UH, I DON'T LIKE TO LISTEN
TO THAT SORT OF GOSSIP,

18:35.244 --> 18:37.812
BUT, UH, ONE HEARS THINGS.LIKE?

18:37.812 --> 18:39.857
EDMUNDS WAS QUITE
THE LADIES' MAN.

18:39.857 --> 18:43.644
HE HAD AFFAIRS.SO I GATHER.
QUITE THE DRAMA SOMETIMES.

18:43.644 --> 18:47.430
DRAMA OF WHAT TYPE?FIREWORKS, AS IT WERE,
YOU KNOW.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.432
BUT AS I SAY,
I DON'T PAY ATTENTION.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.739
ANYBODY YOU KNOW WHO DID--
PAY ATTENTION?

18:51.739 --> 18:54.002
AH, I BELIEVE
ONE OF OUR GRAD STUDENTS

18:54.002 --> 18:56.700
IN THE ASTROPHYSICS DEPARTMENT
WAS, UH, INVOLVED.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.920
NAME?GRETA SKYE.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.494
HOW LONG DOES THIS
DECONTAMINATION TAKE?

19:07.494 --> 19:08.799
ANOTHER HOUR.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.801
HMM.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.597
DON'T TOUCH THAT, PLEASE.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.471
THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
I CAN TOUCH WHAT I WANT.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.517
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.736
THERE'S DANGEROUS STUFF
IN HERE, THAT'S ALL.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.661
[clank]

19:49.144 --> 19:51.755
[chewing] I LIKE WHAT
THEY'RE DOING THESE DAYS.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.757
THEY'RE MAKING
REGULAR CANDY BARS,

19:53.757 --> 19:55.759
ONLY WITH DARK CHOCOLATE.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.108
YOU TRIED THAT?NO.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.110
YOU--YOU WANT A BITE?

19:59.110 --> 20:01.374
NO, THANK YOU.

20:01.374 --> 20:04.072
ALL RIGHT.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.422
HMM. [chewing] REALLY GOOD.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.783
HI.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.786
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.310
ISABEL, RIGHT?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.789
Who are you?

20:25.789 --> 20:27.443
MY NAME'S PATRICK JANE.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.924
I'M HERE TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED YOUR MOTHER.

20:29.924 --> 20:33.101
Good. Kill them, please.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.016
OH, I WISH I WAS ALLOWED
TO DO THAT.

20:35.016 --> 20:39.934
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
STEP AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER.

20:39.934 --> 20:43.807
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS NEARBY? I wanna be with my mother.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.723
YEAH.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.682
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.514
DO YOU HAVE
A CANDY BAR AROUND AT ALL?

20:54.514 --> 20:55.689
What?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.734
WELL, WE WERE JUST TALKING
CHOCOLATE,

20:57.734 --> 21:01.651
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT
CHOCOLATE WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU.

21:01.651 --> 21:05.873
ALL THAT EMOTION--
IT WIPES YOU OUT.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.875
AND SUGAR'S GOOD
FOR ENERGY.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.921
My mother is dead.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.228
CHOCOLATE AND GRIEF
IS A GOOD COMBINATION.

21:13.228 --> 21:16.927
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
IT'LL TASTE SO MUCH... DEEPER,

21:16.927 --> 21:19.756
MORE INTENSE.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.672
EVERYTHING WILL FEEL THAT WAY
FOR A WHILE.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.587
YOU'LL FEEL MORE ALIVE.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.547
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY
TO HANG ON TO THAT FEELING

21:27.547 --> 21:30.376
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
IT'S A GIFT.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.204
I guess.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.903
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME NOW, ISABEL.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.297
I WANT YOU TO PLEASE
TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER

21:38.297 --> 21:40.777
AND GO AND TELL A FRIEND
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.607
YOU DO THAT NOW.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.656
[beep]

22:07.456 --> 22:09.066
OPEN SESAME.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.548

22:12.548 --> 22:15.464
[beeps]WHOA!

22:15.464 --> 22:18.685
[whooshing]

22:18.685 --> 22:22.123
THAT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN,
WAS IT?

22:24.081 --> 22:25.953
UH-OH.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.695
DO YOU HAVE AN ADVANCED DEGREE
IN ANY OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES?

22:28.695 --> 22:30.000
YES.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.742
EXCUSE ME. UH...
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.266
WE NEED TO EXPAND
THE POOL OF SUSPECTS.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.966
THE TRICKY LITTLE HIGH-TECH
SCANNERS LET ANYONE IN.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.576
THAT'S NONSENSE.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.838
TRY IT.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.714
[rapid beeping]

22:47.714 --> 22:49.455
[beeps]

22:49.455 --> 22:51.370
[doors whooshing]I'LL BE DAMNED.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.850
SEE? SAME WITH THAT DOOR.
ANYONE AT THIS FACILITY

22:53.850 --> 22:56.462
COULD'VE GOTTEN TO THOSE
LITTLE VIRUS THINGIES--ANYONE.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.334
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE OPERATION

22:59.334 --> 23:01.641
OF THE SECURITY SCANNERS?[Price] I HAVE NO IDEA

23:01.641 --> 23:04.034
HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN.
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.IT'S YOUR JOB TO OVERSEE

23:04.034 --> 23:05.819
THE SECURITY SYSTEMS HERE,
ISN'T IT?

23:05.819 --> 23:07.690
NOT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS,
OBVIOUSLY.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.563
THAT'S CONTRACTED OUT,
BUT I'LL GET RIGHT ON 'EM,

23:10.563 --> 23:13.783
GIVE 'EM A PIECE OF MY MIND,
BELIEVE YOU ME.YOU'RE SHOWING US YOUR PALMS.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.742
IT'S A SUPPLICANT GESTURE,

23:15.742 --> 23:17.483
SUGGESTING
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.223
THAT--THAT'S NOT VALID
OR RELEVANT.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.791
I'M--I'M SIMPLY STATING
THE FACTS. I HAVE NO IDEA

23:21.791 --> 23:23.793
WHY THE SECURITY SYSTEM
DOESN'T WORK.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.492
THE MAN'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT REAL CONVINCING.

23:26.492 --> 23:29.451
I REGRET
THAT'S YOUR OPINION,

23:29.451 --> 23:33.324
BUT I-I HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER THAT.MR. PRICE, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.935
FOR WHAT?LET'S SEE.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.416
FOR ONE,
THE MURDER OF ALICIA SEBERG.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.853
THAT'S ABSURD.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.768
AND FRANKLY, NOT YOUR CALL.OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

23:41.768 --> 23:44.031
YEAH, THIS HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION IS OURS.

23:44.031 --> 23:47.382
IF WE CAN'T GET ALONG,
I'LL CALL MY FRIENDS AT THE FBI,

23:47.382 --> 23:49.210
GET THEM TO TAKE OVER
FROM YOU.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.734
IN FACT, I WILLDO THAT.
I'M SORRY, LITTLE LADY--

23:51.734 --> 23:53.867
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STEP BACK--

23:53.867 --> 23:57.740
MAY-MAYBE I WAS RIGHT ABOUT
THE SUPPLICANT PALM GESTURE.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.698
YEP.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.883
[engine starts]

24:09.883 --> 24:14.235
[tires screech, siren wailing]

24:17.978 --> 24:21.372
[brakes screeching]

24:30.338 --> 24:33.210
[indistinct conversations]

24:41.828 --> 24:44.004
I... I WANNA TALK
TO MY LAWYER.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.311
YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT,
BUT IF IT DOESN'T--

24:47.311 --> 24:50.010
HAVE YOU EVER SAT IN THE BACK
OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT

24:50.010 --> 24:52.882
WITH A BLACK HOOD
OVER YOUR HEAD?UH... NO.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.884
WELL, THEN YOU GOT
A NEW EXPERIENCE COMIN',

24:54.884 --> 24:58.018
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THIS IS
GOIN' UNLESS YOU START TALKIN'

24:58.018 --> 25:00.194
RIGHT ABOUT NOW!UM... LOOK--

25:00.194 --> 25:01.543
QUIET.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.588
PLEASE.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.810
THE CONTRACTOR SCREWED UP.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.464
THE SOFTWARE GLITCHES
CONSTANTLY,

25:09.464 --> 25:12.249
SO... THEY'RE FIXING IT.

25:12.249 --> 25:15.514
MEANWHILE, THE SYSTEM'S DOWN...
TEMPORARILY.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.865
NOBODY KNEW THE SYSTEM WAS DOWN,
SO IN A WAY,

25:18.865 --> 25:21.824
IT WORKED JUST AS IF
IT WAS UP AND RUNNING...

25:21.824 --> 25:24.392
IN A WAY.HOW LONG WAS IT DOWN FOR?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.612
TWO... MONTHS.

25:26.612 --> 25:30.006
TWO MONTHS?ANYONE AT ALL
COULD ENTER THE LAB--

25:30.006 --> 25:31.834
TERRORISTS, CRAZIES,
THIEVES.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.358
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?

25:34.358 --> 25:36.273
THIEVES?

25:36.273 --> 25:38.014
PEOPLE WANNA STEAL GERMS?

25:38.014 --> 25:42.802
CRYPTOHANSA B STRAIN IS A--
IS A MUST-HAVE RESEARCH TOOL.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.455
IT'S HARD TO MAKE.

25:44.455 --> 25:47.937
IT'S WORTH $300,000 A GRAM
IN THE BLACK MARKET.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.853
WOW.ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PRICE?

25:50.853 --> 25:53.943
AND YOU LEFT THE CUPBOARD DOOR
WIDE OPEN.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.294
[chuckles] YOU ARE YEA DEEP
IN TROUBLE, PAL.

25:57.294 --> 26:00.515
YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SITUATION
FOR A WHILE.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.736
OKAY?
AND WE'LL TALK AGAIN.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.580
YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T
KILL ALICIA SEBERG.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.583
YOU JUST LIKE
SCARING PEOPLE, RIGHT?HEY,
IF THERE WAS A MURDER HERE,

26:24.583 --> 26:28.499
I THINK
HE'S A VERY GOOD SUSPECT.WHY? HE HAS NO INTEREST
IN HER DEATH.

26:28.499 --> 26:32.025
IT COULD ONLY LEAD TO DISCOVERY
OF THE SECURITY BREAKDOWN.WE'LL SEE IF HE HAD
ANY OTHER MOTIVES.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.636
THE SALIENT POINT HERE IS
THAT ANYONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN

26:34.636 --> 26:37.596
TO THOSE FLASKS,
NOT JUST PRICE.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.511
KASEEM COULD HAVE, FOR INSTANCE,
OR YOU COULD HAVE.

26:40.511 --> 26:43.210
YOU WERE ALREADY HERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.255
FOR AN INVENTORY CHECK?

26:45.255 --> 26:47.997
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET HERE,
EXACTLY?

26:47.997 --> 26:50.130
THE NIGHT BEFORE, RIGHT?YOU REMIND ME.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.785
I WAS GONNA CALL THE FBI,
REPLACE YOU PEOPLE.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.917
AND I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.485
WE'RE HERE ON
THE DIRECT SAY-SO OF THE A.G.

26:57.485 --> 27:01.837
CALL HIM. TELL HIM WE'RE OFF
THE CASE. SEE WHAT HE SAYS.I MIGHT DO THAT.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.405
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES,
SHALL WE?

27:04.405 --> 27:07.147
IT'S TIME TO OPEN
THE BIOHAZARD CHAMBER.

27:07.147 --> 27:10.846
OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN,
OPENING THE BIOHAZARD CHAMBER.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.809
SHOULDN'T WE BE
WEARING MASKS OR SOMETHING?

27:16.809 --> 27:19.594
NO VIRUS COULD POSSIBLY
SURVIVE THE RADIATION BATH.

27:19.594 --> 27:23.859
THE VIRUS INSIDE THE FLASKS
ARE STILL ALIVE, OF COURSE.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.861
BUT THE FLASKS
ARE UNBREAKABLE.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.950
THERE'S NO DANGER.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.692

27:42.399 --> 27:45.141
LET'S GET THESE BABIES BACK
IN DEEP FREEZE.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.108
OKAY. WE'RE COPACETIC.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.850
[Lisbon] LET'S SEND
ALICIA SEBERG ON HER WAY.[air whooshes]

28:03.029 --> 28:05.553
DOCTOR, THIS IS
A CRIME SCENE NOW. YOU CAN'T--

28:05.553 --> 28:07.424
[Lisbon] LET HIM STAY.

28:28.968 --> 28:33.363
[woman] OH, MY GOD.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.061
OH, MY GOD.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.063
AND, GRETA, YOU HAD
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

28:37.063 --> 28:38.891
WITH CLIFF EDMUNDS,
THE VICTIM'S HUSBAND,

28:38.891 --> 28:40.414
IS THAT RIGHT?

28:40.414 --> 28:44.505
NO. I MEAN, YES.
IT WASN'T--WELL, YES, I DID.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.507
BUT I DIDN'T.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.510
YOU DON'T THINK I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH KILLING HER?

28:49.510 --> 28:51.555
NO, MA'AM, WE'RE JUST LOOKING

28:51.555 --> 28:55.690
FOR INSIGHT
INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP.YOU THINK CLIFF KILLED HER.

28:55.690 --> 28:57.910
IS HE THE JEALOUS TYPE?NOT AT ALL.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.042
DID HE EVER SHOW VIOLENCE
TO YOU?

29:00.042 --> 29:02.871
NO, NO. CLIFF IS
A VERY GENTLE SOUL, REALLY.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.873
AND ALICIA'S SUCH
A COOL PERSON.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.702
WE HEARD
THERE WAS TROUBLE.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.051
NO.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.792
WELL... [sighs]

29:10.792 --> 29:12.446
THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT,

29:12.446 --> 29:15.536
BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH CLIFF OR ALICIA, REALLY.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.016
PLEASE CONTINUE.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.627
WE'D BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER
FOR A WHILE.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.629
SOMEBODY LEFT A NOTE
FOR ME,

29:21.629 --> 29:24.588
PUSHED UNDER BY DOOR
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.547
BASICALLY,
IT SAID I WAS A WHORE

29:26.547 --> 29:28.462
AND I SHOULD STAY AWAY
FROM CLIFF.

29:28.462 --> 29:31.639
IT WAS VERY UGLY.
IT WAS ANONYMOUS, OF COURSE.

29:31.639 --> 29:35.991
WHO DO YOU THINK
SENT THE NOTE?I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS
ALICIA SEBERG, NATURALLY.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.907
BUT IT TURNS OUT SHE WASN'T
EVEN IN THE COUNTRY

29:38.907 --> 29:41.997
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION.WHO'S YOUR NEXT BEST GUESS?

29:41.997 --> 29:44.608
UM, THE ONE TIME I WENT
TO SEE CLIFF AT WORK,

29:44.608 --> 29:46.697
THERE WAS A LAB ASSISTANT.

29:46.697 --> 29:50.832
SHE GAVE ME THIS GLARE
LIKE A DEATH RAY,

29:50.832 --> 29:54.140
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS HER.WHAT'S HER NAME?

29:54.140 --> 29:55.794
LILITH NASH.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.839
THE QUESTION IS WHY NOW?

29:57.839 --> 30:00.624
WHAT WAS IT THAT TRIGGERED
THE KILLING? WHAT CHANGED?

30:00.624 --> 30:03.018
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

30:03.018 --> 30:06.543
[lowers voice] WELL, FOR
ONE THING, HARKEN SHOWED UP.YOU THINK HARKEN DID THIS?

30:06.543 --> 30:08.850
OOH, I'D LIKE THAT.
BUT WHAT'S HIS MOTIVE?

30:08.850 --> 30:10.765
[cell phone rings]

30:10.765 --> 30:12.158
VAN PELT.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.725
Boss, Cho and Rigsby found
an ex-lover

30:14.725 --> 30:16.205
of the vic's husband.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.947
SHE THINKS LILITH NASH SENT HER
A MENACING NOTE.

30:18.947 --> 30:22.081
INTERESTING.So I dug deeper.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.387
NASH IS CLEAN
UNDER HER CURRENT NAME

30:24.387 --> 30:27.695
BUT HAD A BRIEF MARRIAGE
IN CANADA IN '96, '97.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.916
Under that name, Lilith Blaum,
in '99, still in Canada,

30:30.916 --> 30:32.439
she had a restraining order
taken out against her

30:32.439 --> 30:34.963
BY HER EX-HUSBAND
AND SUBSEQUENTLY

30:34.963 --> 30:38.401
SPENT FOUR MONTHS
IN A SECURE MENTAL INSTITUTE.WELL, THAT COULD HAPPEN
TO ANYONE.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.229
UH, VAN PELT,
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

30:40.229 --> 30:42.318
COULD YOU CALL CHO AND RIGSBY
AND HAVE THEM GET OUT HERE

30:42.318 --> 30:44.016
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE?WHY?

30:44.016 --> 30:46.409
I GOT A HUNCH
WE'RE GONNA NEED 'EM.OKAY.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.585
Thank you.WILL DO.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.674

30:50.674 --> 30:53.112
WHAT?
I THINK SHE'S GOOD FOR IT.AH, SHE'S NUTS.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.723
SHE'S GOT A NUTTY LITTLE
SECRET CRUSH ON THE BOSS,

30:55.723 --> 30:57.681
KILLS THE WIFE.SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.119
SHE DID SEEM NERVOUS,
BUT WHY KILL NOW?

31:00.119 --> 31:03.296
AND WHY WOULD SHE USE
THE VIRUS?I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GO AND ASK HER.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.080
UGH, IF YOU WANT TO.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.082
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE JUST RESISTING NASH

31:07.082 --> 31:09.693
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PEG HER
RIGHT AWAY AS THE ONE.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.479
NO, I'M RESISTING NASH BECAUSE,
UH, SHE ISN'T THE ONE.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.829
BUT IF YOU WANNA GO TALK TO HER,
LET'S GO TALK TO HER.

31:14.829 --> 31:18.093
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT TELL HARKEN.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.052
WHY NOT? IT'S PROCEDURE.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.445
FIG FOR PROCEDURE.
HE'LL STOMP ALL OVER HER.

31:22.445 --> 31:26.188
SHE'LL CLAM UP. YOU'LL GET
NOTHING BUT A WASTE OF TIME.I'M TELLING HARKEN.

31:26.188 --> 31:29.713

32:46.268 --> 32:48.401
NO.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.011
I BELIEVE YOU,

32:50.011 --> 32:51.970
BUT I KNOW HOW
HARKEN'S THOUGHTS RUN.

OH, YOU PEOPLE ARE OVERREACTING.
I'M SURE SHE'S NO DANGER.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.328

BUT HOW DID SHE DO IT?

35:06.147 --> 35:09.150

35:30.215 --> 35:33.218
OH, MY GOD.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.437
THIS IS A DRILL, RIGHT?UH, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.005
THIS IS--THIS IS THE REAL THING.
I'M SORRY.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.660
[all murmuring]

35:40.660 --> 35:43.663
LISTEN UP.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.361
WE HAVE A FEW HOURS LEFT.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.059
BUT WE'LL KEEP
THIS VIRUS CONTAINED HERE.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.106
NOBODY LEAVES THIS FACILITY.

35:52.106 --> 35:56.066
AND THEN WHAT?
WE GET BURIED IN THE DESERT?

35:56.066 --> 35:58.373
THE AIR FORCE WILL DROP
INCENDIARY BOMBS

35:58.373 --> 36:01.115
ON THE FACILITY,
BURN THE VIRUS OUT.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.378
YOUR NEXT OF KIN
WILL BE INFORMED.

36:03.378 --> 36:07.077
LIKE I SAY,
WE HAVE A FEW HOURS LEFT,

36:07.077 --> 36:09.645
SO WE ALL SHOULD MAKE
OUR ARRANGEMENTS

36:09.645 --> 36:12.344
AND SAY OUR PRAYERS
AS BEST WE CAN.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.433
MAKE YOUR PHONE CALLS.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.263
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY
ON OUR SOULS.

36:18.263 --> 36:23.006
[indistinct conversations]

36:23.006 --> 36:24.225
[speaking inaudibly]

36:29.012 --> 36:32.538
[cell phone rings]

36:32.538 --> 36:35.497
HEY, BOSS. WE'RE ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR LOCATION.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.064
Cho, listen.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.893
JANE AND I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
TO THE VIRUS,

36:39.893 --> 36:43.113
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
WE MIGHT DIE SOON.

36:43.113 --> 36:45.855
OKAY.

36:45.855 --> 36:50.120
SO I WANNA THANK YOU AND RIGSBY
AND VAN PELT.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.255
It's been an honor
working with you.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.605
I NEED YOU TO CALL
MY BROTHER TOMMY.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.607
HIS NUMBER IS
IN MY DESK DIARY.

36:58.607 --> 37:02.916
IT'S UNDER
TOWN AND COUNTRY ELECTRICAL.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.918
TELL HIM THAT I LOVE HIM

37:04.918 --> 37:07.877
AND THAT I FORGIVE HIM
FOR WHATEVER

37:07.877 --> 37:13.231
AND THAT, UM, HE NEEDS TO MAKE
PEACE WITH HIS BROTHERS.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.581
It's my last dying wish.
You tell him that.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.147
WILL DO.

37:17.147 --> 37:21.195
OKAY. GOOD-BYE.

37:21.195 --> 37:25.330
UH, WAIT. I-I WANTED
TO TALK TO THEM ALSO.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.635
SORRY.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.158
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.817
THAT'S A FINE FAREWELL.

37:38.386 --> 37:42.216
I FEARED THAT YOU'D BECOME
TEARFUL AND INCOHERENT, BUT NO.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.784
SUCCINCT.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.134
NOBLE. BRAVO.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.049
UH-HUH.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.923
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYBODY
YOU WANNA CALL

37:53.923 --> 37:55.882
BESIDES CHO AND RIGSBY?

37:55.882 --> 37:57.275
NO.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.801
AND IF I WEREDYING,
I'D WANNA CALL YOU,

38:01.801 --> 38:04.630
BUT... YOU'RE ALREADY HERE.
SO THERE'S NO NEED.

38:04.630 --> 38:05.631
ME?

38:05.631 --> 38:07.067
HMM?

38:07.067 --> 38:08.503
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

38:08.503 --> 38:11.811
OH...

38:11.811 --> 38:16.555
UH... WAIT--
WAIT A MINUTE. IF?

38:18.861 --> 38:21.864
IFI WAS DYING?YEAH, YOU'RE NOT REALLY DYING.

38:21.864 --> 38:25.085
I WROTE A LABEL
AND PUT IT ON AN EMPTY FLASK,

38:25.085 --> 38:27.174
AND THEN I CONVINCED
POOR LILITH NASH TO RUN AWAY.

38:27.174 --> 38:30.308
I FEEL KIND OF BAD ABOUT IT--YOU SON OF A BITCH.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.006
BUT JUST--JUST WAIT.
JUST PLEASE. BE STILL. CHO?

38:33.006 --> 38:35.400
THIS IS JANE. PLEASE DISREGARD
LISBON'S LAST MESSAGE.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.967
I TRICKED HER. MY BAD.
[whispers] I'M SO SORRY.

38:37.967 --> 38:41.101
[normal voice] ARE YOU AT
THE CULVERT? OKAY, GOOD. WAIT.

38:41.101 --> 38:43.843
THERE'LL BE SOME PEOPLE
COMING YOUR WAY SOON. BYE.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.584
YOU'RE SICK.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.238
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
TO ME?

38:48.238 --> 38:51.241
TWO REASONS--FIRSTLY, TO CATCH
THE KILLER OF ALICIA SEBERG,

38:51.241 --> 38:53.505
THE KILLER WHO IS NOT
POOR LILITH NASH.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.724
THE KILLER WHO,
YOU MAY RECALL,

38:55.724 --> 38:58.510
TOOK A DOSE OF THE ANTIDOTE
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE

38:58.510 --> 39:00.512
EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS. YES?YES...

39:00.512 --> 39:02.340
THE KILLER WHO BELIEVES
THAT HE OR SHE

39:02.340 --> 39:05.343
IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT ISN'T GOING TO DIE. YES?YES.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.128
SO THEY HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE WEDIE,

39:08.128 --> 39:11.131
OR ELSE THEY'LL BE BURNT
TO A CRISP BY THE AIR FORCE.

39:11.131 --> 39:14.134
THEIR HANDS ARE TIED.
THEY HAVE TO TRY TO ESCAPE,

39:14.134 --> 39:16.789
THUS REVEALING THEMSELVES TO US
WITH PRECISION AND CLARITY

39:16.789 --> 39:20.401
OF A MATHEMATICAL EQUATION.AND REASON NUMBER TWO?

39:20.401 --> 39:22.403
THE SECOND
AND MOST IMPORTANT REASON

39:22.403 --> 39:26.581
IS DOESN'T IT FEEL GREAT
TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK?

39:26.581 --> 39:28.583
DON'T YOU FEEL GOOD
RIGHT NOW?

39:28.583 --> 39:30.803
DON'T YOU FEEL HAPPY
TO BE ALIVE?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.021
NO!

39:32.021 --> 39:34.154
OH, I KNOW YOU DO.
YOU KNOW YOU DO.

39:34.154 --> 39:37.331
IF REASON NUMBER ONE DOES NOT
PAN OUT VERY, VERY SOON,

39:37.331 --> 39:40.465
I THINK I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE NOSE.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.162
FORBEARANCE, LISBON.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.773
ANY MOMENT NOW, HARKEN IS
GONNA COME AROUND THAT CORNER

39:44.773 --> 39:47.297
WITH AN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION
ON HIS FACE

39:47.297 --> 39:49.299
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS RUN OFF.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.040
ANY MOMENT NOW.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.695
WAIT.

39:53.695 --> 39:57.046
ANY MOMENT.

39:57.046 --> 40:00.093
[sighs]

40:00.093 --> 40:01.268
NOTHING.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.012
IF YOU JUST GET--

40:06.012 --> 40:08.144
[whack]OW!

40:08.144 --> 40:11.147
OW!

40:11.147 --> 40:15.195
[Patrick] OW. WHOO!

40:15.195 --> 40:17.327
[high-pitched voice] THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING 'BOUT.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.133
HI.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.794
WELL, THIS WAS ALL A HOAX?

40:48.794 --> 40:52.493
WELL, "HOAX" IS A LITTLE STRONG.
UH, MORE OF A RUSE, A GAMBIT.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.148
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
WE CAUGHT THE KILLER.

40:55.148 --> 40:58.281
RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
GRIFFIN WELKS, HUH?

40:58.281 --> 41:01.023
NEVER WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM
YOUR WAY, AND MY WAY--

41:01.023 --> 41:03.112
CATHARTIC
ANDLIFE-AFFIRMING.

41:03.112 --> 41:07.203
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.858
OKAY, THE IMPORTANT THING NOW
IS TO BE CAREFUL

41:09.858 --> 41:12.774
'CAUSE THIS IS
THE REAL THING. OKAY?

41:12.774 --> 41:15.211
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THAT BACK
IN THE DEEP FREEZE.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.562
SEE YOU AROUND, BIG DOG.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.520
[door opens]

41:25.091 --> 41:28.224
I WAS SIPHONING OFF SMALL
AMOUNTS OF THE VIRUS MATRIX

41:28.224 --> 41:30.183
AND SELLING IT
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.619
$300,000 A GRAM.

41:31.619 --> 41:34.317
YEAH.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.102
YEAH, EXACTLY.

41:36.102 --> 41:39.192
I'M IN CHARGE OF KEEPING
INVENTORY, SO IT WAS EASY,

41:39.192 --> 41:41.542
UNTIL HARKEN ARRIVED
TO DO A SPOT CHECK,

41:41.542 --> 41:44.458
AND I HAD TO DO SOMETHING FAST,
SO I SPILLED A FLASK

41:44.458 --> 41:46.547
TO COVER UP
THE MISSING QUANTITY.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.115
KNOWING FULL WELL
ALICIA SEBERG WOULD BE EXPOSED.

41:51.073 --> 41:55.034
[sighs]
SOMEONE HAD TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.645
I FIGURED
EVERYONE WOULD THINK

41:57.645 --> 41:59.604
THAT SHE'D OPENED THE FLASK
BY ACCIDENT

41:59.604 --> 42:01.867
AND COULDN'T ADMIT TO IT,

42:01.867 --> 42:04.870
'CAUSE SHE WAS LIKE THAT--
COULDN'T BE WRONG.

42:04.870 --> 42:09.048
I'M CURIOUS. THE MONEY
YOU MADE FROM YOUR THEFT--

42:09.048 --> 42:10.397
HOW'D YOU SPEND IT?

42:10.397 --> 42:12.225
I DIDN'T.

42:12.225 --> 42:14.662
I HAVE IT IN TREASURY BONDS
MOSTLY, SOME REAL ESTATE.

42:14.662 --> 42:16.664
MM-HMM,
THAT'S SMART INVESTING.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.536
YOU'LL BE THE RICHEST MAN
IN FOLSOM.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.150
[blinds rattle]

42:26.152 --> 42:29.111
[Patrick exhales deeply]

42:29.111 --> 42:30.896
WHEW. LONG DAY.

42:32.593 --> 42:34.160
OOH.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.902
IT'S CHILLY AROUND HERE.
YOU STILL ANGRY WITH ME?

42:36.902 --> 42:38.730
DUH.[elevator doors open]

42:38.730 --> 42:40.906
OH, CONFESS.
YOU DO FEEL BETTER.

42:40.906 --> 42:43.561
YOU FEEL MUCH MORE ALIVE.
I KNOW YOU DO.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.694
YOU KNOW WHAT
MADE ME FEEL BETTER?

42:46.694 --> 42:49.392
PUNCHING YOU IN THE NOSE.

42:49.392 --> 42:53.222
AH. GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE.

43:00.099 --> 43:03.058
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
