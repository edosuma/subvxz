WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:07.007
[YELLING THROUGHOUT]

00:09.618 --> 00:11.011
ENERGY BALL.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.546
NICE TEAMWORK.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.070
YOU MEAN NICE
SISTER WORK.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.159
WE ARE DEFINITELY
GETTING BETTER AT THIS.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.508
WELL, WE SHOULD BE,

00:30.682 --> 00:31.596
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
LONG ENOUGH.

00:31.770 --> 00:32.554
I THINK WE'RE READY.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.295
SO DO I.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.471
I DON'T.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.776
SOMETHING IS STILL MISSING.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.256
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:39.430 --> 00:41.171
HOW MANY MORE DEMONS
DO WE HAVE TO VANQUISH?

00:41.345 --> 00:43.434
WE'VE BEEN TRAINING
FOR THIS FOR LIKE
8 YEARS.

00:43.608 --> 00:44.914
5 FOR ME.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.699
BUT STILL, WE'VE MASTERED
THEIR POWERS.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.440
THEIR INDIVIDUAL
POWERS, YES.

00:49.614 --> 00:52.443
BUT YOU'RE STILL MISSING
THEIR COLLECTIVE POWER.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.184
THE POWER OF THREE.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.099
AND UNTIL YOU GET IT,

00:56.273 --> 00:57.666
YOU WILL NEVER
TRULY REPLACE

00:57.840 --> 00:59.059
THE CHARMED ONES.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.509
AHH! ANYONE DOWN HERE?

01:58.683 --> 01:59.597
BIG BOX IN HIGH HEELS.

01:59.771 --> 02:00.642
NEED SOME HELP.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.818
JUST A SEC.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.387
SORRY. DO YOU NEED HELP?

02:06.561 --> 02:07.779
WELL, I DID.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.564
NOW I JUST NEED A SEC.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.435
OK, WELL,
SINCE I HAVE YOU...

02:11.609 --> 02:14.090
PIPER, I'M KIND OF
RUNNING LATE.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.570
I HAVE TO GO SIGN
THE LOAN DOCS

02:15.744 --> 02:17.485
AND I WANT TO
STOP BY THE CONDO
BEFORE WORK.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.096
LOAN DOCS?

02:20.270 --> 02:22.098
WOW, I DIDN'T
REALIZE THIS WAS

02:22.272 --> 02:23.621
MOVING ALONG SO QUICKLY.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.102
BUT YOU KNOW
I'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED

02:26.276 --> 02:27.277
ON GETTING LEO BACK.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.887
YEAH. I KNOW.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.934
BUT I HAVE MADE A LIST
OF SEERS AND ORACLES

02:32.108 --> 02:34.589
AND ANYONE THAT MIGHT BE
ABLE TO FORESEE

02:34.763 --> 02:35.807
WHO WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT

02:35.981 --> 02:37.287
IN ORDER TO GET HIM BACK.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.636
GREAT. OK, WELL, CALL ME
IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.117
WELL, I WAS THINKING...

02:41.291 --> 02:43.859
I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE

02:44.033 --> 02:45.600
YOU SHOULD TAKE MY JEEP

02:45.774 --> 02:47.297
BECAUSE MY CAR
HOLDS SO MUCH MORE

02:47.471 --> 02:49.038
THAN YOURS DOES,
DOESN'T IT?

02:49.212 --> 02:50.735
RIGHT.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.130
PIPER, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK WITH ME
MOVING OUT?

02:54.304 --> 02:56.306
YEAH. OF COURSE I AM.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.961
I MEAN, WE CAN'T BE
ROOMMATES FOREVER.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.310
THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

03:00.484 --> 03:03.879
OK. WELL, HERE I GO.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.838
OH, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.451
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A DATE WITH HENRY TONIGHT,

03:10.625 --> 03:12.279
AND HE IS IN THE WORST MOOD.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.498
HE'S LOST HIS CAR KEYS,
HE'S LOST HIS WALLET,

03:14.672 --> 03:16.587
HE'S LOCKED HIMSELF
OUT OF HIS APARTMENT.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.850
AND I NEED HIM TO BE
IN A GOOD MOOD

03:19.024 --> 03:20.591
FOR WHAT I WANT TO
DO TONIGHT.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.593
WE AREN'T TALKING
ABOUT SEX, ARE WE?

03:22.767 --> 03:26.510
NO. WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT SEX.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.860
I FINALLY GOT UP
MY COURAGE TO TELL HIM,

03:29.034 --> 03:30.645
YOU KNOW,
THAT I'M A WITCH.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.690
AND I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO DO IT TONIGHT.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.039
OTHERWISE, I MIGHT
WOOS OUT.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.999
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW
IF HE'S...

03:37.173 --> 03:39.480
OK WITH WHO I AM.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.526
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
A LOT, PHOEBES.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.701
GOT ANY ADVICE?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.965
WELL, HOPE HE
DOESN'T FAINT.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.880
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.100
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T
HAD ANY SUCCESS
WITH THESE THINGS.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.276
JUST EASE INTO IT

03:53.450 --> 03:54.843
TRY TO LESSEN
THE BLOW.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.410
OK, HOW?

03:56.584 --> 03:58.281
MAYBE CALL IN
SOME REINFORCEMENTS.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.544
MAYBE ASK SOME OF
YOUR MAGICAL FRIENDS

04:00.718 --> 04:01.763
TO HELP HIM HAVE
A BETTER DAY

04:01.937 --> 04:03.068
SO YOU CAN HAVE
A BETTER NIGHT.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.548
LIKE FAIRIES OR SOMETHING?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.985
SURE. FAIRIES,
LEPRECHAUNS, WHATEVER.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.857
GOOD LUCK.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.250
UH, PHOEBES?

04:10.424 --> 04:11.903
UH-HUH?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.731
I WAS ACTUALLY
HOPING THAT MAYBE

04:13.905 --> 04:15.385
YOU COULD HELP ME
NARROW DOWN THE LIST

04:15.559 --> 04:17.082
A LITTLE BIT
BEFORE YOU GO.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.910
OH, PIPER.
I'M REALLY LATE.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.913
OH, OK.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST LEO.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.524
REALLY, COME ON.

04:23.698 --> 04:24.699
ALL I NEED IS
ONE LITTLE PREMONITION.

04:24.873 --> 04:25.874
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.179
OK.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.749
WHAT MORE DO WE
HAVE TO DO
TO CONVINCE YOU?

04:31.923 --> 04:33.316
CONVINCING ME
IS IRRELEVANT.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.840
WE ONLY GET
ONE SHOT AT FREEING
OUR BRETHREN.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.189
WE KNOW THAT, SAVARD.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.279
THEN YOU ALSO KNOW
THAT THERE'S A REASON

04:39.453 --> 04:41.281
WHY OUR KIND
HAS BEEN ENSLAVED
FOR CENTURIES.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.894
THE SLAVE KING
IS NO ORDINARY DEMON.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.591
WE ESCAPED.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.940
YES.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.899
SO WE COULD RETURN
WITH ENOUGH POWER

04:51.073 --> 04:52.292
TO DESTROY HIM.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.250
A POWER I'M NOT SURE
WE'VE GOT YET.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.296
WE'VE SPENT THE LAST
8 YEARS

04:56.470 --> 04:57.384
REPLICATING THE GREATEST
POWER THERE IS.

04:57.558 --> 04:58.602
CHARMED POWER.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.300
AND WE'VE NOT
ONLY STUDIED

05:00.474 --> 05:02.911
EVERY ASPECT
OF WHAT THEY KNOW
AND WHO THEY ARE.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.174
WE'VE INFUSED OUR BLOOD
WITH THEIR MAGICAL BLOOD

05:05.348 --> 05:07.437
SO THAT THEIR POWER
IS OUR POWER.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.221
WHICH MEANS...

05:09.396 --> 05:12.007
WE MAY ALREADY
HAVE THE POWER
OF THREE.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.182
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
SHOWN IT YET!

05:13.356 --> 05:14.836
IN ANY TEST OR TRIAL.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.492
WHICH MEANS,
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.625
AND YOU NEED TO GET IT.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.279
IF YOU HAVE ANY HOPES

05:23.453 --> 05:25.325
OF DESTROYING
THE SLAVE KING.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.588
THERE MUST BE A WAY.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.198
THINK BACK.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.983
TAP INTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE
OF THE RICHES.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.642
PHOEBE WAS STUCK IN
A GENIE'S BOTTLE ONCE.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.819
IF WE COULD TRAP HER
IN IT AGAIN,

05:41.993 --> 05:43.125
MAYBE WE COULD
COMMAND HER,

05:43.299 --> 05:45.127
MASTER TO GENIE
TO TELL US HOW.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.999
FORGET IT.
LEO GOT RID OF THE BOTTLE.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.915
WHAT ABOUT USING
THE SWORD, EXCALIBUR?

05:51.089 --> 05:53.091
NO. ONLY WYATT
CAN WIELD IT.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.529
OK. MAYBE I COULD
POSE AS PAIGE.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.487
TRICK THE ELDERS
INTO HELPING US.

05:57.661 --> 05:58.793
RIGHT. LIKE THAT'S
GONNA WORK.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.056
LOOK, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS?

06:01.230 --> 06:02.666
OR ARE YOU JUST
GONNA SHOOT DOWN
ALL OF OURS?

06:02.840 --> 06:04.712
AT LEAST I DON'T
COME UP WITH
STUPID IDEAS.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.888
HEY!

06:07.062 --> 06:08.106
KNOCK IT OFF.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.372
AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT
THE SIBLING RIVALRY
DOWN PAT.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.983
WAIT.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.506
THE DOLLHOUSE.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.858
IT'S A MAGICAL REPLICA

06:21.032 --> 06:22.817
OF THE REAL HOUSE,
ISN'T IT?

06:22.991 --> 06:24.035
WHICH IS BELIEVED
TO BE MAGICAL

06:24.209 --> 06:25.472
IN AND OF ITSELF.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.604
THE HOUSE IS THE WITCHES'
POWER BASE.

06:27.778 --> 06:30.259
HAS BEEN FOR GENERATIONS.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.434
SO?

06:31.608 --> 06:33.523
SO...

06:33.697 --> 06:36.004
IF WE COULD TRAP
ALL OF THEM INSIDE
THE DOLLHOUSE...

06:36.178 --> 06:38.223
LIKE PIPER WAS TRAPPED
ONCE BEFORE.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.964
THEN WE'VE GOT
THE POWER OF THREE CONTAINED.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.531
AND IF WE WERE IN
THE REAL MANOR

06:41.705 --> 06:43.272
WHILE THEY'RE IN
THE DOLLHOUSE...

06:43.446 --> 06:46.797
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CHANNEL THE POWER
OF THREE INTO US.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.630
IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.866
ANYBODY UP THERE?

07:16.914 --> 07:18.742
HELLO?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.111
BILLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:40.285 --> 07:41.461
WHAT ELSE?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.027
STILL TRYING TO FIND
MY SISTER.

07:43.201 --> 07:43.854
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS SYMBOL MEANS

07:44.028 --> 07:45.160
OR WHERE IT LEADS.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.901
I FIGURE IT HAS TO BE
DEMONIC, RIGHT?

07:47.075 --> 07:48.206
NO. I MEAN--

07:48.380 --> 07:49.773
IT IT'S IN HER DIARY,

07:49.947 --> 07:51.079
YOU'D THINK I'D BE
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING

07:51.253 --> 07:52.515
ABOUT IT IN THIS BOOK,
BUT I--

07:52.689 --> 07:54.517
BILLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN PHOEBE'S ROOM?

07:54.691 --> 07:57.128
OH, SHE SAID I COULD
HANG OUT IN HERE

07:57.302 --> 07:58.739
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
GONNA BE USING IT.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.741
IS THAT OK?

08:00.915 --> 08:03.613
OH. YEAH, SURE.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.006
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

08:05.180 --> 08:06.877
IF SHE'S NOT GOING
TO BE USING IT ANYMORE.

08:07.051 --> 08:10.054
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
TAKE THIS STUFF
TO MY DORM.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.839
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.362
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

08:13.536 --> 08:14.624
I WISH SHE WOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING, THAT'S ALL.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.887
IS THAT OUR SPIRIT BOARD?

08:17.061 --> 08:20.282
UH...YEAH, SHE SAID
I COULD BORROW IT

08:20.456 --> 08:22.110
TO TRY AND
CONTACT CHRISTY.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.372
CAN I?

08:23.546 --> 08:24.678
YEAH. YOU KNOW...

08:24.852 --> 08:27.158
SURE. IF YOU WANT TO
START PAYING RENT.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.292
JUST KIDDING.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.773
CAN I BORROW THE BOOK?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.428
HEY, WHERE'D IT GO?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.394
HEY THERE. OK.
HERE'S THE THING.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.963
MY SORT OF--
HOPEFULLY HE'LL BECOME
MY BOYFRIEND HENRY,

08:49.137 --> 08:51.052
HE'S HAVING A BIT
OF A PROBLEM
LOSING THINGS

08:51.226 --> 08:52.880
LIKE A WALLET, HIS KEYS,
YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THAT.

08:53.054 --> 08:56.492
AND NOT TO CAST
ANY ASPERSIONS
ON YOUR CHARACTER,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.146
YOU GUYS ARE KNOWN FOR

08:58.320 --> 09:00.104
THE KIND OF
STICKY FINGER PROBLEM.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.671
SO I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD GO BACK

09:01.845 --> 09:03.368
TO YOUR PEOPLE,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.719
AND TELL THEM TO
PUT EVERYTHING BACK.

09:05.893 --> 09:06.894
THAT WOULD HELP ME
SO MUCH

09:07.068 --> 09:08.591
BECAUSE I REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY

09:08.765 --> 09:11.333
NEED HIS UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION TONIGHT.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.814
THANK YOU.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.345
PAIGE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:23.519 --> 09:25.390
JUST TAKING
PHOEBE'S ADVICE.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.271
REALLY?

09:36.445 --> 09:37.838
IT'S THE MOST
AMAZING THING.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.187
I MEAN, FIRST MY KEYS
TURN UP IN THE LAUNDRY.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.058
THEN ONE OF MY PAROLEES
FINDS MY WALLET.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.538
STILL HAS EVERYTHING IN IT.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.279
THAT'S GREAT.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.020
MY 49ers HAT,
I LOST IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.499
MY LETTERMAN'S JACKET.

09:47.674 --> 09:48.675
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING
IS TURNING UP.

09:48.849 --> 09:49.719
IT'S CRAZY.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.068
VERY SUBTLE.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.679
I MEAN, VERY...
VERY LUCKY.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.595
SOME WOULD SAY
MAGICAL.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.684
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.903
SO GOOD. ARE WE STILL
ON FOR DINNER?

10:00.077 --> 10:01.731
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU CAN'T
TELL ME RIGHT NOW?

10:01.905 --> 10:03.733
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO WAIT AND...

10:03.907 --> 10:05.561
HEAR ALL ABOUT IT
TONIGHT.

10:05.735 --> 10:06.867
7:00 OK?

10:07.041 --> 10:08.346
LOOK, PAIGE.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.958
5 OF MY PAROLEES HAVE JOB
INTERVIEWS TOMORROW.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.264
THEY ALL ASKED ME
TO WRITE LETTERS

10:13.438 --> 10:14.396
OF RECOMMENDATION
FOR THEM TONIGHT.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.050
OK. WRITE THEM.

10:16.224 --> 10:19.096
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S
A LITTLE EASIER
SAID THAN DONE.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.055
I, UM...
I'M NOT A WRITER, PAIGE.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.273
LOOK, PLEASE.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.169
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.779
OH, GOT YOU SCARED, HUH?

20:15.953 --> 20:17.172
LITTLE BIT. LITTLE BIT.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.478
I FINISHED
THOSE LETTERS.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.828
AND WROTE YOU
A LOVE LETTER.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.003
GOT INSPIRED.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.613
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.399
ASSUMING YOU STILL WANT
TO READ IT TO ME.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.139
WHY WOULDN'T I?

20:28.314 --> 20:29.619
Intercom: HENRY,
THEY NEED YOU DOWN
AT THE STATION STAT.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.056
HANG ON A SECOND, PAIGE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.015
Intercom: GPS WENT DOWN
ON YOUR PAROLEES
TRANSMITTERS.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.538
SERGEANT NEEDS YOU
TO HELP FIND THEM.

20:35.712 --> 20:36.626
GREAT.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.627
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:37.801 --> 20:38.628
MEANS I GOT TO GO.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.196
UH-UH-UH. WHAT ABOUT DINNER?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.415
SORRY, PAIGE.

20:42.589 --> 20:43.677
BAD LUCK.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.074
I'M NOT ON CALL,
YOU KNOW.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.468
LOOK, I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD, OK?

20:52.642 --> 20:53.643
REALLY, REALLY, I'M NOT.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.645
AND BESIDES,
YOU GUYS OWE ME.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.518
YOU REMEMBER A LITTLE
SOMEBODY NAMED SEAMUS?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.302
HA! NOW IT'S BLACKMAIL,
IS IT?

21:00.476 --> 21:02.652
NO. IT'S NOT BLACKMAIL.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.133
LOOK, I JUST NEED
MY BOYFRIEND HENRY

21:05.307 --> 21:06.917
TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF LUCK

21:07.091 --> 21:09.268
WHICH IS WHY
I NEED YOUR HELP.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.226
SO JUST PLEASE
COME MEET ME
AT THE POLICE STATION

21:11.400 --> 21:14.229
IN AN HOUR
AND I WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU, OK?

21:14.403 --> 21:16.144
ALL RIGHT.
BUT DON'T BE LATE.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.407
I'M A BUSY LEPRECHAUN,
YOU KNOW.

21:19.930 --> 21:23.107
GO N-EIRI-AN-BOTHAR LEAT!

21:25.806 --> 21:27.634
DON'T YOU JUST HATE
LEPRECHAUNS?

21:35.598 --> 21:36.512
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:42.779 --> 21:46.130
YES. I THINK I DO.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.747
WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.140
WE'RE TRAPPED, AND EVEN
WORSE THAN THAT,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.794
WE ARE REALLY,
REALLY SMALL.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.797
OK...

22:00.971 --> 22:02.756
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT THAT MEANS

22:02.930 --> 22:04.366
THERE IS NO WAY
OUT OF THIS PLACE?

22:04.540 --> 22:05.541
WELL, UNLESS YOU WANT
TO GET SQUISHED.

22:05.715 --> 22:06.847
THIS CAN'T BE.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.196
I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.067
SORRY. CAN'T MISS IT.
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.155
WE'RE ORBING OUT OF HERE.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.983
YEAH, BUT...

22:15.116 --> 22:16.247
WHY DIDN'T THAT WORK?

22:16.422 --> 22:17.466
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH MY POWERS?

22:17.640 --> 22:18.859
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.470
I THINK OUR POWERS
WERE DOWNSIZED AS WELL.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.652
ROCK.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.571
UH, WHO'S HE?

22:35.745 --> 22:37.747
HE'S THE DEMON
THAT REPLACED US
WITH LOOK-A-LIKES.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.270
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

22:39.445 --> 22:40.228
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T NOTICE

22:40.402 --> 22:41.316
THAT WASN'T ME.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.796
WELL, SO ARE WE.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.145
YOU ONLY VANQUISHED
A WIZARD WITH US.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.800
SHE VAN--HER...

22:46.974 --> 22:48.105
THE NOT YOU.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.847
WHATEVER.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.632
WAIT A SECOND.

22:52.806 --> 22:53.981
WE USED
THE POWER OF THREE.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.852
YEAH. I THINK THAT'S
PART OF THEIR PLAN.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.985
THEY KEEP US HERE,
AND THEN USE
THE POWER OF THREE

22:58.159 --> 23:00.030
TO VANQUISH SOME GUY
NAMED THE SLAVE KING

23:00.204 --> 23:02.685
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, US.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.384
WE HAVE TO GET
TO PIPER SOMEHOW
BEFORE THEY DO.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.125
YEAH, BUT HOW?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.259
SO THEN I TRIED TO MATCH

23:11.433 --> 23:12.782
THE SYMBOL
WITH THE COUNCIL

23:12.956 --> 23:14.305
BUT IT WASN'T
A DIRECT MATCH.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.744
IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:17.918 --> 23:18.962
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.138
THAT'S JUST A REALLY
BORING STORY.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.489
BORING?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.578
YEAH. I THINK YOU
SHOULD JUST GIVE UP.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.407
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE

23:28.581 --> 23:30.060
YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY
FIND HER ANYWAY.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.814
PAIGE, DON'T START
WITH ME, OK?

23:44.988 --> 23:46.076
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.601
FORGET IT, LADY.
I'M ON TO YOU.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.429
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:50.603 --> 23:52.996
[CHUCKLES]
RELAX.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.476
IT'S JUST ME, PATRA.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.957
OH, THANK GOD.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.306
THIS SISTER STUFF
IS TAXING.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.568
DON'T WORRY.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.570
IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.578
THERE YOU ARE.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.407
IF YOU TWO ARE UP HERE
TO GANG UP ON ME,

24:12.581 --> 24:13.582
FORGET IT.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.106
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.587
PHOEBE'S COME TO APOLOGIZE,
HAVEN'T YOU, PHOEBE?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.329
REALLY?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.071
OK...

24:24.245 --> 24:26.029
I'M LISTENING.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.728
WELL, PIPER,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

24:28.902 --> 24:33.559
THAT I'M SORRY FOR NOT
BEING MYSELF LATELY,

24:33.733 --> 24:36.475
AND IF IT SEEMS THAT
I DON'T CARE ABOUT

24:36.649 --> 24:37.867
WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH,

24:38.041 --> 24:40.348
I'M SORRY.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.654
THANK YOU.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.220
I'M SORRY, TOO.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.745
WELL, GREAT.
NOW THAT THAT'S
TAKEN CARE OF,

24:45.919 --> 24:46.746
I'VE GOT TO LEAD.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.964
WHAT? HOW?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.271
WHITELIGHTER GRAPEVINE.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.882
TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S
A FAST-RISING DEMON

24:53.056 --> 24:55.102
IN THE UNDERWORLD
KNOWN AS THE SLAVE KING.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.582
OH, THE SLAVE KING.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.801
YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF HIM.

24:58.975 --> 24:59.846
REALLY? I HAVEN'T.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.152
WELL, THE ELDERS HAVE.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.893
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TRACK HIM DOWN

25:04.067 --> 25:05.199
AND SEE IF WE CAN
FIND ANYTHING.

25:06.635 --> 25:07.462
I DON'T KNOW.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.898
I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS

25:09.072 --> 25:09.856
ON THIS DEMONIC SEER
I FOUND.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.248
NO, NO.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.555
THE ELDERS SAY
HE'S PRETTY EVIL.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.252
HE'S ENSLAVED AN ENTIRE
DEMONIC RACE

25:15.426 --> 25:16.950
FOR CENTURIES NOW.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.039
WELL, THAT ACTUALLY
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THING.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.519
NO. IT'S NOT.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.390
HE'S FORCING THEM TO DO
HIS DEMONIC BIDDING.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.177
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
WE SHOULD CHECK ON
IS ALL.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.180
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
TO LOSE?

25:30.354 --> 25:31.791
YEAH.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.836
YOU TWO SEEM AWFULLY
GUNG HO ABOUT THIS.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.012
WELL, ANYTHING
TO FIND LEO, HON.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.015
SHOULD WE LOOK
AT THE BOOK?

26:14.268 --> 26:17.271
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M BEING STOOD UP.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.055
BY A WITCH.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.103
SO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

26:23.277 --> 26:24.408
NOT YET.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.326
WHY DIDN'T YOU
MEET ME LIKE YOU SAID?

26:29.500 --> 26:32.547
OH, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE...

26:32.721 --> 26:34.288
SOMEONE WHO'S GOT
BETTER THINGS TO DO

26:34.462 --> 26:36.159
THAN CHASING
THE WHIMS OF A WITCH.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.423
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
YOU BEEN TO
THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.730
WELL, I'VE JUST BEEN BUSY
HELPING MY SISTER.

26:41.904 --> 26:42.992
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GIVE

26:43.166 --> 26:44.385
YOUR BOYFRIEND
A LITTLE LUCK.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.170
THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T IT?

26:47.344 --> 26:49.782
THAT SOUNDS JUST...
SWELL.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.871
SO HOW ABOUT YOU GO
GIVE THAT GUY SOME LUCK.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.786
SCAMPER OFF.
SKEDADDLE.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.744
GO WITH GOD.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.093
FINE.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.443
BUT AFTER THIS,
WE'RE EVEN.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.447
GO N-EIRI-AN-BOTHAR LEAT!

27:12.021 --> 27:13.283
NOW WHERE WERE WE?

27:28.559 --> 27:30.344
SLAINTE IS TAINTE!

27:43.009 --> 27:43.966
HEY.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.533
HENRY? YOU'RE IN LUCK.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.100
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.492
JAMESON. WHERE'D YOU
FIND HIM?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.190
I WAS JUST WALKING IN
AND THERE HE WAS.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.366
WALKED RIGHT UP TO ME
AND TURNED HIMSELF IN.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.672
HENRY!

27:54.934 --> 27:56.196
GOT TWO MORE
FOR YOU.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.980
CAUGHT THEM
JUST BEFORE
THEY LEFT TOWN.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.460
WHERE'D YOU FIND THEM?

27:59.634 --> 28:00.722
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THEM FOR WEEKS.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.725
YEAH, IT'S MITCHELL.
WHAT?

28:04.987 --> 28:06.293
I JUST WON
TEN THOUS--

28:06.467 --> 28:08.687
I JUST WON $10,000.

28:08.861 --> 28:09.992
I JUST WON $10,000!

28:15.955 --> 28:17.217
WHAT IS
GOING ON TODAY?

28:19.610 --> 28:22.526
WELL, HE'S POWERFUL,
BUT HE'S NO SEER.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.094
I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE WOULD KNOW
WHO'S AFTER US.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.749
MAYBE THE ELDERS
DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.230
WELL, WHO ARE WE
TO QUESTION THEM?

28:30.404 --> 28:32.841
WE QUESTION THEM
ALL THE TIME.

28:33.015 --> 28:33.929
RIGHT.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.148
MAYBE THIS TIME

28:35.322 --> 28:37.846
THEY JUST KNOW SOMETHING
WE DON'T.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.239
OK. CAN WE GET ON
WITH THIS?

28:39.413 --> 28:40.544
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.288
ANY VANQUISHING POTION
IN THERE?

28:45.462 --> 28:46.507
NO.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.378
OK. WELL, WE CAN
MAKE ONE, RIGHT?

28:48.552 --> 28:50.119
THERE SHOULD
BE ONE IN THE BACK
OF THE BOOK.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.425
JUST FLIP TO THE BACK
OF THE BOOK.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.862
I KNOW, THANK YOU.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.605
WHAT WAS THAT?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.302
DID YOU SEE THAT?

28:59.476 --> 29:00.608
SEE WHAT?

29:00.782 --> 29:02.262
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT?

29:02.436 --> 29:03.959
THAT WAS WEIRD.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.570
IT FELT LIKE SOMEBODY
WAS CALLING ME
OR SOMETHING.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.618
THAT IS ODD.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.098
IS THAT THE POTION?

29:12.272 --> 29:14.753
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

29:14.927 --> 29:16.058
THIS.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.582
CAVE.

29:22.456 --> 29:23.762
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.595
OK. WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME HENBANE,

29:31.770 --> 29:34.076
GYPSY'S BLOOD
AND HEMLOCK ROOT.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.127
TOGETHER AGAIN.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.750
PIPER, ARE YOU OK?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.534
NO. YOU PUNCHED ME.

29:57.708 --> 29:58.579
I DID NOT PUNCH YOU.

29:58.753 --> 29:59.885
IT'S HER
DEMONIC DOUBLE.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.887
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:02.061 --> 30:04.846
WE'VE BEEN
REPLACED.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.937
OH, NO, NO, NO.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.853
DON'T TELL ME WE'RE STUCK
IN THE DOLLHOUSE.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.986
IT SEEMS TO BE
AN ANNUAL EVENT
FOR YOU.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.205
OH, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THEY WERE DEMONS.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.424
SPEAKING OF DEMONS,

30:17.598 --> 30:19.774
DID THEY MENTION
SLAVE KING TO YOU?

30:19.948 --> 30:21.776
YES. RIGHT BEFORE
I SHOWED THEM

30:21.950 --> 30:22.777
THE VANQUISHING POTION.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.126
OH, GREAT.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.824
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD'VE DONE.

30:25.998 --> 30:29.044
MAYBE IF I'D BEEN
AROUND MORE LATELY...

30:29.218 --> 30:30.654
NO. FORGET ABOUT IT,
PHOEBE.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.395
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

30:33.962 --> 30:35.746
THE QUESTION IS
HOW DO WE
GET OUT OF HERE?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.748
WE COULDN'T EVEN
CALL YOU WITH THE LOST
WITCH SPELL.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.185
OH, THAT WAS YOU.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.229
I THOUGHT
I FELT SOMETHING.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.927
MAYBE IT'LL WORK
ON BILLIE?

30:42.101 --> 30:43.537
HOW?

30:43.711 --> 30:45.495
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO CAST A SPELL.

30:45.669 --> 30:46.932
NO. BUT MAYBE
WE HAVE ENOUGH

30:47.106 --> 30:48.934
TO GET THROUGH
TO THE SPIRIT BOARD.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.676
DO YOU THINK GRAMS
MADE A REPLICA OF THAT?

31:01.381 --> 31:02.556
CHRISTY?

31:04.906 --> 31:08.562
D-O-L-L-

31:08.736 --> 31:12.958
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E

31:14.481 --> 31:15.699
DOLLHOUSE?

31:18.006 --> 31:20.226
YOU GUYS, THE WEIRDEST THING
JUST HAPPENED.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.270
NOT NOW.

31:21.444 --> 31:22.489
MUSTARD SEED.

31:22.663 --> 31:23.751
NO. BUT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.405
THE SPIRIT BOARD,
IT WORKED.

31:25.579 --> 31:26.754
I ACTUALLY
GOT A MESSAGE.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.147
WHAT KIND
OF MESSAGE?

31:28.321 --> 31:30.192
WELL, IT SPELLED OUT
DOLLHOUSE.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.541
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS FROM CHRISTY,

31:31.715 --> 31:33.021
BUT YOU GUYS HAVE
A DOLLHOUSE, RIGHT?

31:33.195 --> 31:34.675
ACTUALLY,
WE GOT RID OF IT.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.677
KEEP STIRRING.

31:36.851 --> 31:37.983
BUT I THOUGHT I SAW

31:38.157 --> 31:39.593
WYATT PLAYING WITH IT
A FEW DAYS AGO?

31:39.767 --> 31:41.334
WE'LL LOOK FOR IT LATER.
WE HAVE A DEMON TO VANQUISH.

31:41.508 --> 31:44.293
DON'T YOU THINK
THIS MEANS SOMETHING?

31:44.467 --> 31:45.599
I DO BELIEVE

31:45.773 --> 31:48.036
THAT MY SISTER
JUST ASKED YOU TO LEAVE.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.168
EXCUSE ME?

31:49.342 --> 31:50.821
ARE YOU DENSE?

31:50.996 --> 31:52.562
WE REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR
YOUR CRAP RIGHT NOW.

31:52.736 --> 31:53.781
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

31:53.955 --> 31:55.217
YOU GUYS HAVE TO
BE JOKING.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.915
DO WE LOOK LIKE
WE'RE JOKING?

31:57.089 --> 31:58.568
DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU

31:58.742 --> 32:01.267
WHAT A GIANT PAIN
IN THE ASS YOU ARE?

32:01.441 --> 32:03.008
WHAT?

32:03.182 --> 32:05.097
OH!

32:05.271 --> 32:07.490
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE KEEP YOU AROUND.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.622
BUT--

32:08.796 --> 32:09.797
GET RID OF HER.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.887
GLADLY. FRONT PORCH.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.933
[SIGHS] THAT WAS FUN.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.413
DO YOU THINK WE WERE
TOO HARD ON HER?

32:17.587 --> 32:19.502
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE
BLOWN OUR COVER.

32:19.676 --> 32:20.808
DOESN'T MATTER.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.201
WE DON'T HAVE TO
LOOK LIKE

32:22.375 --> 32:23.680
THE CHARMED ONES
ANYMORE.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.205
WE'VE GOT
THE POWER OF THREE.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.949
IT'S TIME TO FREE
OUR KIND.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.619
HOW DARE YOU ESCAPE ME.

32:49.793 --> 32:52.013
AND HOW DARE YOU RETURN!

32:53.710 --> 32:55.799
COME CLOSER.

32:55.974 --> 32:56.975
COME CLOSER.

32:59.629 --> 33:00.979
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN WISE

33:01.153 --> 33:02.589
TO HAVE TAKEN
YOUR OWN LIVES
ON THE OUTSIDE.

33:02.763 --> 33:03.807
RATHER THAN SUFFER THROUGH

33:03.982 --> 33:05.635
HOW I'M GOING TO
TAKE THEM FOR YOU.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.378
WHERE'S THE OTHER?
SAVARD?

33:09.552 --> 33:11.293
HE'S WAITING FOR US
TO BRING HIM
THE GOOD NEWS.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.729
THE GOOD NEWS?

33:12.903 --> 33:13.861
WHAT GOOD NEWS?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.471
OF YOUR DEMISE.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.908
[LAUGHING]
KILL THEM.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.867
NOW!

33:20.041 --> 33:21.477
[SCREAMING]

33:27.570 --> 33:28.441
IT WORKED.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.356
WE DID IT.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.141
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.581
UH, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

33:38.755 --> 33:40.975
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
WHAT'S PLAN B?

33:41.149 --> 33:42.020
THIS IS PLAN B.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.673
BILLIE WAS PLAN A.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.894
WELL, REMIND ME
TO EVICT HER
IF WE GET OUT OF THIS.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.287
YOU'RE SURE
THIS IS GONNA WORK?

33:48.461 --> 33:50.898
WELL, I HOPE SO.
IT'S YOUR PLAN.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.031
YOU HAVE A POINT THERE.

33:55.685 --> 33:59.037
OK. DO IT NOW.

33:59.211 --> 34:00.342
POINTY THING.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.477
OH, IT ONLY
MOVED A LITTLE.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.044
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE I AM LITTLE.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.828
WELL, TRY AGAIN.
KEEP TRYING.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.525
POINTY THING.

34:14.008 --> 34:14.922
BETTER.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.445
OK, PIPER.
YOU'RE UP.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.925
HEY! YOO-HOO.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.840
[WHISTLING]

34:20.014 --> 34:21.363
HELLO?

34:21.537 --> 34:23.148
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT
DOWN HERE.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.371
OK. A LITTLE
TO THE LEFT.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.809
[Whispering]
POINTY THING.

34:32.983 --> 34:33.810
PERFECT.

34:33.984 --> 34:34.811
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

34:34.985 --> 34:35.812
YOU.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.075
AAH!

34:37.249 --> 34:38.380
UNH!

34:41.296 --> 34:43.081
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

34:45.648 --> 34:46.910
WHERE'S SAVARD?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.303
SAVARD?

34:48.477 --> 34:51.176
OH, I THINK THEY HAVE
A HEIGHT ADVANTAGE.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.488
OUR KIND IS FINALLY FREE,

34:59.662 --> 35:00.707
BUT NOW SAVARD
WILL NEVER SEE IT.

35:00.881 --> 35:01.882
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.579
HOW COULD THEY
HAVE KILLED HIM?

35:03.753 --> 35:07.279
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEY DID.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.281
OK, IF BILLIE
DOESN'T SHOW UP

35:09.455 --> 35:10.630
IN LIKE 2 SECONDS,
WE'RE DOLL PARTS.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.240
HANG ON. THERE MIGHT BE
ANOTHER WAY.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.112
TALK FAST.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.505
WELL, OUR INDIVIDUAL
POWERS ARE DIMINISHED,

35:16.679 --> 35:18.899
PUT NOT THE POWER OF THREE.
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE USING IT.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.379
TALK FASTER.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.859
WELL, IF WE CAN GET THEM
TO STOP CHANNELING US

35:23.033 --> 35:24.600
AND USE THEIR
DEMONIC POWERS,

35:24.774 --> 35:26.646
THEN WE CAN GET
THE POWER OF THREE BACK.

35:26.820 --> 35:27.995
THEORETICALLY
SPEAKING, RIGHT?

35:28.169 --> 35:29.301
ALL WE GOT ARE THEORIES.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.391
THIS IS FOR SAVARD.

35:32.565 --> 35:33.653
HEY, HEY.
HANG ON A SECOND.

35:33.827 --> 35:34.958
WHAT ARE YOU--

35:35.133 --> 35:35.959
YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME
WITH MY OWN POWER?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.309
WHAT ARE YOU,
KIDDING ME?

35:37.483 --> 35:39.441
HOW INSULTING,
LET ALONE BORING.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.139
YEAH.
SHOW SOME PRIDE.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.662
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
BE ORIGINAL.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.620
YOU GUYS MUST SUFFER
FROM REALLY LOW SELF-ESTEEM

35:44.794 --> 35:46.274
NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE.

35:46.448 --> 35:47.797
WHICH IS CLEARLY WHY
THEY HAD TO STEAL
OUR POWERS.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.365
THAT MUST BE
VERY HUMILIATING.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.457
[GRUNTING]

36:03.248 --> 36:04.727
OH, THANK GOD.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.773
I KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULDN'T REALLY BE
THAT MEAN TO ME.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.340
I KNOW I CAN BE A HUGE
PAIN IN THE ASS
SOMETIMES--

36:08.514 --> 36:10.342
BILLIE, ZIP IT!
GO GET THE BOOK.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.082
OH, THE BOOK. RIGHT.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.389
FIND THE POWER
SWITCHING SPELL.

36:14.563 --> 36:15.564
SWITCH, UH...

36:15.738 --> 36:17.392
SWITCH BODIES WITH POWERS.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.786
AND THEN, YOU KNOW.
IMPROVISE.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.961
OK. WHO ARE WE SWITCHING?

36:21.135 --> 36:22.310
THEM.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.619
I THOUGHT WE BOOTED
YOUR ASS OUT.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.230
UH, YOU DID.
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.929
WHAT'S THEIRS IS YOURS,
WHAT'S YOURS IS THEIRS.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.977
I OFFER UP THIS GIFT
TO SHARE.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.674
SWITCH THE BODIES
THROUGH THE AIR.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.202
YOU WANTED TO LIVE
LIKE US,

36:44.376 --> 36:45.812
NOW I GUESS YOU GET
TO DIE LIKE US.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.030
OH, CRAP.

36:55.517 --> 36:56.692
WELL, THEY SAY IMITATION

36:56.866 --> 36:58.564
IS THE GREATEST FORM
OF FLATTERY.

36:59.956 --> 37:01.436
WELL, THEY DO.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.446
HEY, HENRY.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.840
YEAH?

37:14.014 --> 37:15.058
GUESS WHAT?

37:15.233 --> 37:16.190
WHAT?

37:16.364 --> 37:19.062
I LIKE YOU.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.283
HEY, PAIGE.

37:23.763 --> 37:24.851
GUESS WHAT?

37:25.025 --> 37:26.374
WHAT?

37:26.548 --> 37:27.723
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.906
I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS DAY IS GETTING
A LOT BETTER

37:37.080 --> 37:38.430
THAN HOW IT STARTED.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.259
YEAH. SO FAR.

37:41.433 --> 37:42.390
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING
THINGS LIKE THAT?

37:42.564 --> 37:43.565
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME?

37:43.739 --> 37:44.827
COME ON. IT CAN'T BE
THAT BAD.

37:45.001 --> 37:48.918
ROOFTOP PICNIC.
STARLIGHT, CANDLES.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.398
WAIT, WAIT. I WANT
TO GUESS FIRST ACTUALLY.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.748
HOLD ON.
LET ME SEE.

37:52.922 --> 37:53.923
YOU USED TO BE
A MAN BEFORE?

37:54.097 --> 37:56.622
NO. THAT'S NOT
TRUE, RIGHT?

37:56.796 --> 37:58.014
GOOD.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.104
COME ON. TELL ME.
WHAT IS IT?

38:02.584 --> 38:04.412
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

38:04.586 --> 38:05.848
YOU TRY ME.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.459
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED

38:07.633 --> 38:12.594
ABOUT THE KIND OF
STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPEN

38:12.768 --> 38:15.945
WITH ME AND KIND OF
SINCE YOU'VE KNOWN ME?

38:16.119 --> 38:20.646
LIKE WHY WAS I THERE
TRYING TO HELP
YOUR PAROLEE?

38:20.820 --> 38:25.477
HOW DID I FIND
THAT BABY'S FATHER
SO QUICKLY?

38:25.651 --> 38:29.045
HOW'D YOU GET THAT GUY
TO TELL THE TRUTH?

38:29.219 --> 38:32.048
HOW DID YOU GET SHOT
AND MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVE?

38:32.222 --> 38:34.834
AND EVEN LITTLE THINGS
LIKE TODAY.

38:35.008 --> 38:37.837
FINDING YOUR KEYS
AND YOUR WALLET.

38:38.011 --> 38:40.405
AND THEN THERE'S
THAT WINNING OF
THE $10,000 THING

38:40.579 --> 38:42.015
WHICH YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GIVE TO CHARITY.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.277
BECAUSE THAT, YOU KNOW--

38:43.451 --> 38:44.583
OK. OK.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.585
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME, PAIGE?

38:46.759 --> 38:49.239
DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?

38:49.414 --> 38:52.330
I DON'T KNOW.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.853
I DON'T THINK
ABOUT IT MUCH. WHY?

38:54.027 --> 38:56.290
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU DID.

38:57.900 --> 38:58.945
LIGHTS.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.605
I'M DOING THAT
RIGHT NOW.

39:06.779 --> 39:07.997
HOW?

39:08.171 --> 39:08.998
I'M A WITCH.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.957
I HAVE POWERS.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.481
I CAN MAKE THESE
KIND OF THINGS HAPPEN.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.004
I'M NOT THE KIND
OF WITCH

39:15.178 --> 39:16.484
THAT RIDES AROUND
ON BROOMSTICKS,

39:16.658 --> 39:18.356
OR THE HAT OR WITH
THE LITTLE BLACK CAT.

39:18.530 --> 39:19.661
THAT SORT OF THING.

39:19.835 --> 39:24.274
I USE MY POWERS FOR GOOD.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.755
I HELP PEOPLE.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.062
AND THIS IS NOT
GOING WELL,
AND I CAN SEE

39:29.236 --> 39:32.979
HOW COMPLETELY
SCARED OFF YOU ARE
FROM ME.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.634
DOOR'S RIGHT THERE,
AND IT WON'T
HURT MY FEELINGS.

39:39.812 --> 39:40.943
PAIGE?

39:41.117 --> 39:41.988
WHAT?

39:42.162 --> 39:43.424
LOOK AT ME.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.210
I'M NOT AFRAID.

40:09.711 --> 40:10.799
HANG ON.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.279
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE.

40:12.453 --> 40:15.195
REALLY? I THOUGHT
I GRABBED ALL THE BOXES.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.850
WELL, THIS ONE I KIND OF
PUT TOGETHER FOR YOU

40:18.024 --> 40:21.331
JUST IN CASE
YOU NEED MORE HERBS
OR POTION VIALS,

40:21.506 --> 40:23.203
OR CRYSTALS,
OR YOU KNOW CLIFFNOTES,

40:23.377 --> 40:24.726
OF THE BOOK OF SHADOWS,
JUST IN CASE.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.120
JUST IN CASE
A DEMON ATTACKS.

40:27.294 --> 40:28.513
YEAH. DON'T LAUGH.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.166
AND YOU KNOW IT.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.561
AND WHEN IT DOES,
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALONE.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.216
PIPER, I'M JUST
MOVING INTO TOWN, YOU KNOW.

40:36.390 --> 40:37.391
IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

40:37.565 --> 40:40.525
YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT
DOWN THE HALL.

40:40.699 --> 40:42.657
THAT'S TRUE.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.923
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GO...

40:48.097 --> 40:51.536
NO. YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.625
THERE'S SOME BLONDE CHICK
ASLEEP IN YOUR ROOM.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.106
I'M JUST A LITTLE SAD.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.891
BUT I CAN BE
A LITTLE SAD.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.675
ABSOLUTELY.

41:02.677 --> 41:03.678
I'M SAD, TOO.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.118
IT'S JUST...

41:09.292 --> 41:12.948
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
A LOT OF CHANGE.

41:13.122 --> 41:16.474
YOU KNOW THIS WILL
ALWAYS BE MY HOME, RIGHT?

41:17.649 --> 41:19.215
AND THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.696
THIS IS FAMILY.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.047
YEAH.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.702
OK. YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

41:33.403 --> 41:34.579
SEE YOU.
