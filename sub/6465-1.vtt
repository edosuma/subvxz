00:14.760 --> 00:20.700
What purpose are we here for?

00:20.900 --> 00:22.380
I meant to take your brain

00:22.520 --> 00:24.200
but I missed.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.220
and only took your right hand.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.580
Interesting...

00:28.500 --> 00:30.320
He wants to kill us!

00:32.340 --> 00:35.140
The most important thing is
exchanging information.

00:35.740 --> 00:41.180
When I researched the Devil I found
they are mostly like humans.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.840
Your mother, right? She was A!

00:48.040 --> 00:49.980
Tell me this is a dream!

00:51.220 --> 00:52.360
Shinichi!

01:02.680 --> 01:04.900
What happened to me?

01:05.040 --> 01:07.520
You are Shinichi-kun, right?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.280
No ...!!!

01:16.620 --> 01:18.900
It was an impossible shot.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.340
he didn't not move like a human?

01:27.740 --> 01:31.900
Motherhood is a difficult
thing to understand.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.740
I can not cry.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.420
They all must die!

02:38.780 --> 02:40.220
Thank you for coming.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.460
You sure about this?

02:44.260 --> 02:48.640
The information we get could be useful.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.020
&#9834; 001, come in.

03:14.660 --> 03:18.100
He looks human, so do they.

03:20.900 --> 03:25.460
Is he a Human?

03:28.280 --> 03:29.300
Yes.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.060
Your sure he's not a monster?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.980
Yes, I am sure, he's human.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.620
Next.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
Next!

03:55.440 --> 03:58.000
Oi, perhaps this woman...

03:59.840 --> 04:01.060
Next.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.800
Just another women that
looks like my Aunt!

04:09.240 --> 04:12.300
He is crazy, useless.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.980
Crazy? Because I can tell
between man, and monster...

04:27.860 --> 04:29.420
Do not run!

04:29.940 --> 04:31.720
What makes me different...

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
Yes...

04:34.300 --> 04:36.240
Is, I like playing with people.

05:11.860 --> 05:14.880
When I first saw it, I was surprised.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.400
Because he resembles a man

05:23.880 --> 05:27.880
I was curious and followed...

05:33.880 --> 05:38.300
It was surprising.
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

05:43.100 --> 05:50.280
It became very clear he was not
the same kind of monster as me.

06:03.420 --> 06:05.660
Tell him to look forward.

06:08.940 --> 06:09.940
Tell him.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.300
Please show me your face.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.260
No...

06:28.840 --> 06:29.840
He's not...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.660
There is something different?

06:36.160 --> 06:39.860
For a moment I thought...

06:42.180 --> 06:43.620
Maybe just my feelings.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.520
Many have died from these monsters.

07:16.980 --> 07:20.740
The discovery was baffling.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.940
Stay close to Shinichi Izumi.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.140
Shinichi! I feel sejenisku,
not far away.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.320
Where?

07:29.620 --> 07:31.340
About 70 meters.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.140
In addition...

07:36.940 --> 07:40.280
one of them was his mother.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.620
And also,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.200
suspicious here is,

07:48.160 --> 07:52.440
none other than Hideo Shimada.

07:53.540 --> 07:58.140
who was with the others
that were killed.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
Was it a coincidence?

08:02.460 --> 08:03.460
Hirama-san...

08:04.900 --> 08:07.320
It's not very likely.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.260
Customer?

09:09.580 --> 09:12.120
No... Man?

09:13.760 --> 09:14.760
Is he strong?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
You...

09:17.420 --> 09:18.980
Let's do this.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Wait!

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
Great...

09:46.000 --> 09:47.400
we weren't fast enough...

09:51.780 --> 09:52.780
What is it?

10:18.520 --> 10:22.080
There was someone there,
you couldn't feel it.

10:22.940 --> 10:25.560
I can not feel humans.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.540
Luckily they didn't call the police.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.820
We are still in danger, do not worry a
bout things that are not important.

10:35.700 --> 10:41.080
Like your friends at school,
it will cause more problems.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.440
There your friends too, right?

10:45.460 --> 10:47.260
It is better to play safe.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.340
I wish you were dead,
and I could be human again.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.240
settle down.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.300
I will kill them though,
just like my fake mother.

10:59.740 --> 11:00.740
Mr. A?

11:03.940 --> 11:06.440
He was a monster, that is all.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.700
Just like the fake mayor
that says he will protect the city.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.040
What if he did better than the humans?

11:18.320 --> 11:20.260
I bet you would be good in my soup.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.220
stop it, Shinichi...

11:24.060 --> 11:25.060
Shinichi!

11:28.620 --> 11:33.040
Delicious, you are so tasty.

11:33.580 --> 11:36.840
... and you say the mayor is a monster.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.300
Now what's the problem?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.300
Our friends killed again.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Where?

11:58.200 --> 11:59.920
Dining, Block E.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.240
find out how many.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.360
Tamiya-san?

12:06.040 --> 12:07.200
What do you think?

12:09.340 --> 12:12.980
Shinichi Izumi, is dangerous...

12:13.440 --> 12:18.300
That I will admit.

12:18.900 --> 12:23.180
We should not underestimate him.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.760
What do you intend to side with him?

12:27.300 --> 12:31.700
No, I just want to meet with
Izumi Shinichi and Migi.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.200
It will be advantageous to us.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.180
He might be able to help us.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.740
Maybe?

12:49.540 --> 12:52.280
Where is the boss,
I want to speak with him first?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.140
Course exercises.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.240
We do not need his permission.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.660
Shut up!

13:24.440 --> 13:29.940
We have already made to many enemies.

13:30.820 --> 13:34.680
and the nation is on to our killings.

13:35.220 --> 13:40.780
We must find a way to live in our new forms.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.900
Well then.

13:46.040 --> 13:50.320
We will leave it to you then Tamiya-san.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
Hey...

14:20.660 --> 14:22.900
What are you laughing at, asshole!

14:24.120 --> 14:26.640
This is the headquarters of Yakuza right?

14:27.700 --> 14:28.960
How many people are inside?

14:29.280 --> 14:32.940
Bastard, you know what I'll do to you!

15:31.200 --> 15:32.680
He did great.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.380
He said it was poor training.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.980
Killing 8 members of the
Yakuza wasn't enough?

15:45.660 --> 15:48.800
It was not me, but Miki.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
Miki, yes...

15:51.700 --> 15:53.640
Don't you also want credit?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.840
There were not injuries,
so I did not participate.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.840
Only the battle...

16:05.460 --> 16:06.600
becomes too much.

16:07.840 --> 16:12.380
When he comes back let him know
he did a good job.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.620
What else?

16:19.820 --> 16:23.240
There have been many who were killed
by Nizumi Shinichi and Migi.

16:24.780 --> 16:25.780
Then Kill him.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.540
Tamiya-san refused,
she wants to continue her observations.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.260
There is hope for him, she says.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.240
Hope, yes...

16:38.760 --> 16:40.660
But how

16:42.440 --> 16:45.760
If it becomes to late.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
Soon we will not need these humans.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.740
We will sever our relationships
and gain control.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.260
Long wait?

17:13.380 --> 17:14.720
Ti-No...

17:21.020 --> 17:25.180
Tamiya-san, we should take action.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.280
What do you mean?

17:32.280 --> 17:33.980
I understand your feelings,

17:35.460 --> 17:37.760
you do not want to get hurt, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
But...

17:40.380 --> 17:44.720
We need to do something about this.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.100
The government will find out soon.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.740
I know this because I've worked as a journalist.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.600
I'm sorry to say this but...

18:02.820 --> 18:04.240
you also need money, right?

18:08.340 --> 18:10.900
Raising children yourself is difficult.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.860
I know, what it is like.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.420
Sorry, I did not mean to advise you.

18:22.820 --> 18:23.820
It's, just...

18:25.300 --> 18:27.320
so that you can understand.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.280
But...

18:32.380 --> 18:34.180
Coming from someone in the same situation.

18:34.220 --> 18:35.100
Kuramori-san...

18:35.100 --> 18:36.120
Y-Yes?

18:37.620 --> 18:40.860
Can you wait a bit longer,

18:42.700 --> 18:45.560
think about it.

18:51.340 --> 18:55.620
I just want to be sure about this.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.320
Ba-right.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.700
Cilu Ba!

19:15.300 --> 19:16.980
Cilu Cilu Cilu Ba

19:37.420 --> 19:38.420
I'm home.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.020
Yumi?

19:46.300 --> 19:47.500
Have you ate?

20:03.240 --> 20:04.760
Do you want to be my new mother?

20:06.160 --> 20:06.820
Ha?

20:07.120 --> 20:10.160
Ah, of course you don't want to.

20:10.820 --> 20:14.640
What are you trying to say?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.900
just that your all grown up.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.940
Your so disgusting?

20:23.660 --> 20:24.660
Apparently...

21:18.240 --> 21:20.960
It's like nothing happened.

21:25.940 --> 21:27.340
People said,

21:29.600 --> 21:31.440
forget it all happened.

21:33.140 --> 21:34.740
Do not talk about it.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.240
Strange is it not?

21:43.580 --> 21:44.580
But...

21:47.580 --> 21:48.580
maybe?

21:51.580 --> 21:53.140
Why do you say that?

21:54.080 --> 21:59.640
Why do not behave like yourself Shinichi...

22:32.460 --> 22:33.460
Shinichi!

22:34.200 --> 22:35.380
What do you want?

22:59.800 --> 23:00.900
What is this?

23:04.300 --> 23:05.300
What do you mean?

23:09.100 --> 23:09.520
Kill!

23:09.520 --> 23:10.520
Wait!

23:11.880 --> 23:13.540
He knows our secret,

23:14.140 --> 23:14.700
We should kill him!

23:14.740 --> 23:16.040
Do not! He is human.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.740
You did not matter if he is human.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.140
Do not kill humans!

23:19.300 --> 23:21.680
Please do not kill me!

23:27.900 --> 23:29.000
Show mercy?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.020
It's all here...

23:39.760 --> 23:41.540
It looks like I looked into the camera.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
Who cares.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.160
Were you going to publish it?

23:48.480 --> 23:52.740
Not like that, it's just I
like to know the public opinion...

23:53.520 --> 23:56.540
You were very different from the others.

23:57.340 --> 23:58.620
Should we kill him!

23:59.760 --> 24:02.900
Wait a minute, its my duty
to uncover the truth.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.340
You just want money, right?

24:06.740 --> 24:09.900
Izumi-kun, you hate them, right?

24:10.700 --> 24:14.180
The police will arrest them.

24:18.020 --> 24:21.060
The monster that killed my mother
was a former police officer.

24:24.580 --> 24:25.580
Kuramori-san...

24:27.520 --> 24:29.420
How do you know about me?

24:31.220 --> 24:35.000
Anu... Someone told me.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.400
She said you were one of the monsters.

24:39.440 --> 24:39.940
She?

24:40.440 --> 24:41.480
The women Tamiya Riyoko?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.060
and you believed her,
are you interested in her?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.220
no its not that...

24:52.220 --> 24:56.320
Tamiya Riyoko also a monster,
and more dangerous than me.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
Huh?

24:58.540 --> 25:01.320
She is also a monster?

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
No way!

25:29.940 --> 25:34.120
Long time no see, it's been awhile

25:35.840 --> 25:38.380
Come to my house, and have some coffee.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.860
No need to be act human.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.220
Do you really want to finish that experiment?

25:46.720 --> 25:50.200
It is no longer an experiment, I am a mother.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.580
Do not call yourself a Mother...

25:55.680 --> 25:58.600
Your a monster, the women you ate is a mother.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.240
You do not need to meddle in the affairs of others.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.780
You are also a killer.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.200
You mean those monsters?

26:08.920 --> 26:15.040
I am trying not to feed on humans anymore.

26:15.620 --> 26:20.220
Give me time.

26:21.420 --> 26:23.920
Do you think I can trust you?

26:33.360 --> 26:39.880
Believe me, I guarantee you safety.

26:41.140 --> 26:43.280
How can I ever believe a monster.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.460
People said, you must have mutual trust.

26:49.780 --> 26:50.880
Believe it.

26:52.700 --> 26:53.700
Shut up!

27:20.220 --> 27:21.660
This is what you wanted, right?

27:22.460 --> 27:26.780
Tamiya Riyoko, is the leader of the monsters.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.060
They are obedient to her orders.

27:31.180 --> 27:36.360
Do not look any further,
forget her and seek a safe place.

27:42.740 --> 27:45.120
Tamiya Riyoko is a killer.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.920
I gave you Mercy.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.920
Do not follow us anymore.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.060
Damn!

28:05.020 --> 28:06.300
How could she...

28:07.140 --> 28:09.100
Damn ...!

28:18.260 --> 28:20.100
I will not stay silent.

28:27.540 --> 28:31.640
We've been trying to prevent
widespread panic, but

28:32.840 --> 28:38.680
History can repeat itself.

28:45.640 --> 28:50.320
Thank you so much, but I have to go.

28:51.340 --> 28:53.340
You've been very helpful.

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
Excuse me.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.680
He is with the police.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
Kill him.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.700
We can not let him live
if he dared to come here.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.020
What about Riyoko Tamiya?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.000
She does not need to know.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.560
I'm sorry, about yesterday!
I know you were just trying to...

30:16.180 --> 30:17.180
help me.

30:20.260 --> 30:22.920
I know you are still suffering
from what happened...

30:25.100 --> 30:26.380
to your mother...

30:27.640 --> 30:30.480
I try not to think about it.

30:33.340 --> 30:36.880
because you don't want to look weak?

30:38.800 --> 30:39.960
Do you want to talk about it?

30:44.040 --> 30:47.040
I want to cry...

30:50.640 --> 30:52.000
But the tears will not come out.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.100
Maybe humanity has left me.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.720
Shinichi-kun is Shinichi-kun...

31:07.020 --> 31:08.140
You are Shinichi-kun.

31:13.780 --> 31:16.000
Shinichi, there is an enemy approaching.

31:19.100 --> 31:22.380
I need to go right now, later.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.600
Shinichi-kun...

31:27.300 --> 31:30.360
I did not give them any hint.

31:31.080 --> 31:35.880
I've done my best, haven't I?

31:36.700 --> 31:40.300
I will get back to you later.

31:42.140 --> 31:45.580
Dad, what is it? you look frustrated.

31:47.960 --> 31:52.020
Yumi, if you wanted to me to buy you something
you just have to ask.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.760
Your only nice when you want something.

31:55.940 --> 32:00.520
Being happy is enough, isn't it.
I don't want you to stress.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.020
You are kidding me.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.640
of course I am not kidding you.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.520
but you can buy me a new game.

32:10.780 --> 32:13.240
Why should I do that?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.400
I need to get cigarettes.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.260
Yeah keep smoking yourself to death?

32:20.820 --> 32:22.360
Totally like her mother.

32:25.440 --> 32:25.920
Where is he?

32:26.240 --> 32:29.020
He's following us, about 300 meters away.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.240
Is it Tamiya?

32:30.460 --> 32:33.220
No, I feel a much stronger aura.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.100
He is coming for us.

32:35.580 --> 32:36.620
How many?

32:37.060 --> 32:38.180
There are 5 of them.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.020
5 monsters?

32:42.700 --> 32:45.540
Tamiya damn, she
guaranteed our safety.

32:46.620 --> 32:47.660
there still following us.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.220
There's no point in hiding,
they know our brain waves.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.840
It looks like we have to fight.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.000
It's 5 against 1 you know?

33:09.040 --> 33:10.060
What is he?

33:10.640 --> 33:11.640
He is alone.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.240
It can not be...

33:13.240 --> 33:14.780
obviously he is alone.

33:20.440 --> 33:23.720
Ah, there you are...

33:25.620 --> 33:27.540
you are a fast one.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.160
No way,

33:29.540 --> 33:29.940
Ha?

33:29.940 --> 33:31.220
He totaled 5 people.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.580
He has monsters all over his body.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.840
That is why I sensed 5 of them.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.620
Absolutely!

33:44.300 --> 33:45.620
and now you die!

34:47.620 --> 34:48.719
Oi, stop!

35:30.620 --> 35:32.240
You can't run from me...

35:34.520 --> 35:35.860
Does he have any weakness?

35:35.860 --> 35:37.160
No...

35:37.620 --> 35:38.060
Heh?

35:38.060 --> 35:40.520
The monsters attack on their own.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.140
Just give up!

35:51.320 --> 35:52.120
What?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.740
He is not balanced,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.320
we must kill the original monster.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.400
The original one?

35:57.460 --> 35:59.820
Use your speed to beat him.

36:01.740 --> 36:03.560
It looks like this will be the end!

36:03.620 --> 36:04.860
Gotcha!

36:18.500 --> 36:19.500
Gotcha!

36:20.660 --> 36:24.840
It seems that we only killed the head.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.360
the rest are still alive.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.500
Should we destroy the heart.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.820
dammit...

37:25.180 --> 37:26.180
Miki...

37:27.300 --> 37:28.320
Come back!

37:39.080 --> 37:42.340
You are more suitable as a right hand.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.880
Miki.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.420
Let's can't go home.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.440
We must devise a plan to face them.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.760
It is time to manifest themselves, huh?

37:55.820 --> 37:57.240
There is no other choice.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.660
Hirokawa...

38:22.440 --> 38:24.440
thanks to whom you are you Chairman?

38:26.500 --> 38:28.200
Of course, all thanks to you.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.300
Then why,

38:30.220 --> 38:32.560
do you make plans without me

38:36.380 --> 38:41.440
Tamiya-san, in this case we had
to make a quick decision.

38:42.820 --> 38:47.680
Shinichi Izumi, Migi, the detective,
knew to much

38:48.640 --> 38:51.500
so it's like this because
your research.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.400
Do not act as you wish!

38:56.380 --> 38:57.380
and

38:58.360 --> 39:02.860
his daughter

39:04.100 --> 39:05.740
you did not have to kill her.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.460
Chairman Kiroku commanded us to.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.340
We kill humans all the time.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.100
You all...

39:16.080 --> 39:18.620
did not understand humans.

39:20.820 --> 39:26.100
Sometimes they are more concerned
for themselves than others.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.580
And if you hurt them, hatred

39:32.100 --> 39:34.240
can take them over.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.140
Is not there a hint?

39:38.100 --> 39:39.660
or Possibility...

39:41.100 --> 39:44.900
He became a different person yesterday.

39:45.320 --> 39:50.340
Do not hide secrets from us?

39:51.580 --> 39:54.040
Tell us what you know!

39:57.940 --> 40:00.640
Humans are just like animals.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.540
One by one that might be true.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.240
But...

40:08.140 --> 40:11.160
A lot of things are different...

40:13.040 --> 40:14.060
Humans...

40:16.480 --> 40:17.480
by the hundreds,

40:17.940 --> 40:18.940
by the thousands,

40:19.420 --> 40:21.300
by the millions gathered into one,

40:22.200 --> 40:24.680
is a form of life.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.320
that can be

40:31.100 --> 40:33.680
more dangerous than us.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.020
Shoot!

40:47.420 --> 40:49.180
Strong enough...

40:51.180 --> 40:53.160
to make us perish.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.780
Do not do anything again
to undermine my efforts.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.660
or...

41:04.060 --> 41:06.400
I will you destroy you all myself.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.900
Do you mind, Hirokawa?

41:23.300 --> 41:24.300
No.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.480
Vice Chairman, how?

42:20.260 --> 42:21.260
Ba...

42:28.700 --> 42:29.740
Ba...

42:39.840 --> 42:41.120
Cilu Cilu...

42:42.440 --> 42:43.540
Ba

43:55.400 --> 43:56.620
I'll be back.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
Hirama-san!

44:32.160 --> 44:34.180
Kiramori not in his hotel.

44:34.180 --> 44:35.180
Heh?!

44:35.860 --> 44:37.280
What are you doing?!

44:37.520 --> 44:38.940
I think he escaped...

44:39.600 --> 44:41.940
Make sure everything is prepared!

44:42.300 --> 44:43.300
now!

44:54.580 --> 44:55.580
Stop!

45:00.360 --> 45:01.840
You know what

45:02.780 --> 45:04.980
humans call this?

45:06.860 --> 45:07.860
Corruption...

45:08.520 --> 45:10.080
Rebellion...

45:10.840 --> 45:13.360
or betrayal.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.820
To be honest,

45:18.620 --> 45:20.440
it's confusing.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.860
You're too much with the humans.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.140
With 3...

45:30.400 --> 45:32.100
do you really think you can win?

46:23.160 --> 46:24.980
Dare kalu do this...

46:25.880 --> 46:26.920
Mr. Detective.

46:31.240 --> 46:33.020
Get ready soldiers.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.420
the operation...

46:37.340 --> 46:40.400
is a clean sweep of all the
monsters in this building.

46:42.380 --> 46:44.380
There must be no mistake.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.800
All troops, forward!

46:50.300 --> 46:51.300
Now!

47:18.120 --> 47:19.120
Kuramori-san?

47:24.240 --> 47:25.880
Finally we are connected.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.880
Where are you now?

47:29.960 --> 47:33.480
Anu... We will help you.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.960
We're going to help avenge your daughter.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.920
I'll do it myself.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.080
Chairman of the monster...

47:46.240 --> 47:48.020
will die.

47:51.100 --> 47:53.060
Hello?! Kuramori-san?!

47:55.480 --> 47:56.880
Why did he run away?

47:57.360 --> 47:58.760
It looks like it is already clear.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.340
Tamiya sensei?

48:19.800 --> 48:21.560
Murano Satomi-san, huh?

48:23.920 --> 48:26.220
Do you know where he is?

48:28.700 --> 48:31.920
I also was looking for him,
he would not answer the phone.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.040
Anu...

48:38.400 --> 48:41.200
If you find him,

48:42.620 --> 48:43.620
please let me know.

48:46.500 --> 48:47.500
You're worried?

49:05.740 --> 49:08.120
Give the telephone number.

49:34.780 --> 49:35.860
It looks like you're okay.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.980
It's you...

49:42.280 --> 49:45.120
Do you still want to have coffee?

49:45.820 --> 49:47.900
What happened wasn't because of me.

49:48.900 --> 49:53.100
But because of my research.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.900
Really research, how stupid.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.560
Maybe your right.

50:07.940 --> 50:09.160
Please meet with me.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.200
I have something for you.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.940
Come to the park on the ease side.

51:00.700 --> 51:03.800
Emergency, emergency,
Please listen carefully.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.780
There is a dangerous mission.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.680
Currently under way on the
roof of the building.

51:15.340 --> 51:19.680
All employees who are inside
please get out of the building.

51:20.320 --> 51:22.960
Do not panic, we will protect you.

51:23.260 --> 51:25.600
Please follow the direction
of the officers.

51:35.900 --> 51:37.580
All troops already in position.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.500
do the operation immediately.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.540
Everyone please stay calm.

51:43.740 --> 51:46.940
the officers will protect you.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.760
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.580
Follow the direction of the
officers and do not panic.

51:54.060 --> 51:57.320
Trust us and do not panic.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.720
Everyone, please leave the
building orderly.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.900
Stay calm, leave the building.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.320
There is no need to panic.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.060
be cautious, and watch your step.

52:27.880 --> 52:29.720
Target found.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.640
I'm sorry, please come this way.

52:34.040 --> 52:35.180
The other one is still running.

52:35.180 --> 52:36.180
Please.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.280
One caught, Continue.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.980
you kidnapped my son,

53:16.220 --> 53:19.200
Your not working
with the police,

53:19.500 --> 53:20.800
only yourself.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.000
What do you want?

53:26.500 --> 53:27.780
I do not know...

53:29.500 --> 53:30.880
I do not know.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.480
I just wanted revenge...

53:37.800 --> 53:39.580
for what happened.

53:41.900 --> 53:44.100
I knew killing you would be hard, so

53:45.340 --> 53:47.140
I brought this child.

53:49.460 --> 53:51.240
You can feel it, can't you...

53:54.780 --> 53:59.340
I will kill this child
 in front of your eyes.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.280
That is my intention.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.740
I understand, you have lost

54:07.480 --> 54:09.700
your humanity.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.060
Stop!

54:16.200 --> 54:17.380
Do not come near me.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.200
I was an unreliable father,

54:29.800 --> 54:32.840
and will never have the chance.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.980
to say...

54:37.400 --> 54:39.780
I'm sorry.

54:42.080 --> 54:44.540
It wasn't me

54:45.960 --> 54:47.400
that killed your daughter.

54:47.780 --> 54:49.120
I do not care!

54:50.280 --> 54:52.580
This child's death will be on you!

54:58.180 --> 54:59.940
What are you doing, Kuramori-san?

55:02.080 --> 55:03.820
Do not do this.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.100
Hey, where are you going?!

55:17.260 --> 55:18.700
Please stop!

55:26.280 --> 55:28.200
Everyone, get back!

55:28.660 --> 55:30.440
Everyone get back now!

55:31.000 --> 55:32.620
Please remain calm!

55:32.740 --> 55:34.800
Keep calm and back away.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.880
The targets are in the building.

55:37.140 --> 55:38.140
Got it.

55:40.640 --> 55:42.320
Were going into the building.

56:10.340 --> 56:12.320
There's no point in killing the baby.

56:13.260 --> 56:16.160
For Tamiya, it is only an experiment.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.520
It is not her child!

56:20.020 --> 56:23.180
If you kill him you will be just like them!

56:24.640 --> 56:25.680
If she didn't care,

56:26.960 --> 56:29.380
She would not have come, right?

56:30.060 --> 56:31.260
Tamiya Ryoko!

56:32.900 --> 56:35.520
This baby will pay for everything!

56:36.600 --> 56:41.360
Obeying orders seems to make the monster angry.

56:46.580 --> 56:48.040
Do not blame...

56:49.440 --> 56:50.680
us.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.400
what?

56:55.200 --> 56:58.840
We're just weak creatures.

57:01.320 --> 57:03.200
That is what you call weak?!

57:04.800 --> 57:08.400
When compared to humans...

57:08.660 --> 57:10.960
we are just

57:12.000 --> 57:13.680
weak creatures.

57:15.100 --> 57:17.140
But we survived,

57:18.020 --> 57:19.520
as Parasytes.

57:22.800 --> 57:23.800
Therefore...

57:26.000 --> 57:27.220
Do not blame us.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.140
I just trying to find my way out.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.800
Is something wrong?

57:56.780 --> 57:57.780
Yes.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.100
Humans are important to us.

58:16.540 --> 58:18.740
But for humans

58:19.580 --> 58:20.980
what are we?

58:23.780 --> 58:26.840
The conclusion I came up with is

58:27.940 --> 58:29.640
to help each other.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.880
Monsters and humans together...

58:34.840 --> 58:36.480
as one family.

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
Family?

58:40.340 --> 58:41.460
yes...

58:42.940 --> 58:44.980
he is a human child.

58:51.820 --> 58:53.400
like you,

58:55.060 --> 58:56.900
so for us and humans there is

58:58.960 --> 59:00.080
hope.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.660
Shinichi Izumi?

59:15.640 --> 59:17.460
Restore,

59:18.820 --> 59:20.200
my son.

59:22.160 --> 59:23.200
Kuramori-san...

59:24.380 --> 59:25.800
This is enough...

59:29.320 --> 59:31.060
Family, us and them.

59:32.120 --> 59:33.280
Monsters and humans.

59:35.640 --> 59:36.920
you and I...

59:37.840 --> 59:39.620
are not a family!

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.220
It was surprising...

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.220
It was a human...

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.580
that tried,

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.240
to kill your son...

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.880
Kuramori-san!

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.520
Do not move!

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480
Tamiya?

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.260
You revealed your identity
to protect a human

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960
It was surprising.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.060
I was also surprised...

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.560
Marvelous...

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.880
I never thought would it would end like this.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.700
I'm happy I have prepared myself.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:42.200
Of course you also do not realize that
you are the real monsters.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.640
Look at yourselves.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.680
You kill far more than they do.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.520
And if you think about it.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.840
You must be aware of the
meaning of there existence.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.960
They are here...

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.420
because of you because of the

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.440
Greed of man...

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.340
We destroy our own species.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.980
because we do not understand?

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.220
You think it is for the best.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.780
With all this, so called justice?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.640
If we compare, the balance
between living beings,

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.640
man is only an insect
that wants to be a master!

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120
No...

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.160
may be more appropriate insects.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.640
Parasytes...

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.800
What nonsense, are you finished?

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.320
He's... Human!

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.040
He was a monster that wanted
to be seen as human.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.900
Nobody is to blame.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.160
One target, huh?

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.380
Tamiya Ryoko, so interested with humans.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.420
Always wanting to use them

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.180
for research.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.040
He's a Monster?

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.600
Isn't it obvious?

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.660
Shoot!

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.540
I can sense it...

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.620
We must kill him.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.360
Izumi-kun! Come here, stop him!

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.240
Wait, do not go.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.160
I have something to for you.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.400
Do not come near!

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.040
Stop!

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.560
Prepare to fire!

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.420
This is the last warning!

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.960
Do not come near!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.200
Shinichi Izumi...

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.480
Migi...

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.740
It is time.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.400
Shoot!

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
Shoot!!!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.660
Do not shoot!

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.180
Stop it! The baby is human!

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.940
Why Didn't you run.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.140
I...

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.140
always thought about it.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.560
Are purpose in this world?

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.440
Whenever I found an answer
I found more questions.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.060
There was no end to it.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.140
and it is all I could ever think about...

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.020
If I run.

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.060
He will be forced to do the same,

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.080
if it came to a stop, I want it to end.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.120
I just want to...

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.080
Finally say it is over.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.220
Even if it is like this...

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.000
I will find the answer.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.440
I do not want this baby...

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.260
to feel my loneliness.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.859
to be raised without humans.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.319
I wish him well.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.040
If I have learned anything

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.380
Living as a human,

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.560
it is not that bad...

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960
She's dead...

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.700
Ya...

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.439
mother...

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.600
dead,

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080
leave you alone.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.460
my...

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.940
humanity is back.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.440
We've been trying to figure out this mess.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400
Let us take him.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.920
You had a relationship
with the parasite?

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.540
Will you tell me about it?

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.400
Shinichi-kun...

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It's okay.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.760
That's impossible, right?!

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.480
Try to make sure once again.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.740
From whom?

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.320
Extermination Forces...

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440
Hmm...

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.920
The swat team is dead...

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640
Hello?

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.540
Impossible, there were
there were only 5 monsters...

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.480
But

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.500
there are still others.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.180
Still 1 remaining...

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.760
We need to run!

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.140
Go.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.960
ah! you got me...

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.660
Hirama-san!

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.760
Hirama-san!

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.480
Hirama-san!!!

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.920
Hirama-san...

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.800
Wait!

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.820
Shinichi...

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.720
You know how to drive?

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.140
I've learned from a book.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.980
We survived.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:48.780
No...

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.400
I don't think so.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.220
Heh?

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.260
Distance is about 100 meters.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.020
Where is he?

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.460
50 meters.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.700
What? Where is he?!

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.180
Distance is 0 meter.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:41.200
He's dead?

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.140
No, not yet.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.440
He's tough.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.820
I don't think we can get away.

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.220
This isn't going to work...

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.260
We can not fight him together.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.660
What if we separate?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.740
then you could hide.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.300
and sneak up on him.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.980
hurry we must go now Shinichi.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.200
and if it doesn't work, then what?

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.400
There is no plan B, come on!

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.460
dammit.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.220
Shinichi, moved to plan B!

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.860
Well, what's plan B?

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.940
You have to run Shinichi!

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.500
I have to what?

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.220
Run!

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.720
We both do not need to die...

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.820
would be more advantageous
if one of us survived.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.060
your kidding!

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280
What are you doing!

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.460
Go, you idiot!

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.220
Migi!

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.220
Get out!

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.480
NO...

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.060
Migi...

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.780
Migi!!!

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.820
Run, Shinichi!

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.460
just keep going,

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.560
Good, Shinichi...

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.980
When I met you, and couldn't
take over your brain...

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.580
I was happy.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.040
Satomi?

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.120
Shinichi-kun?! Where are you?

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520
I'm sorry...

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.880
Your hurt!

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.140
Satomi...

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.100
Migi's gone...

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.720
Migi's dead...

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.700
There's still me...

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.540
There's still me here!

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.680
Hold on, Shinichi-kun...

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.160
This is not the end...

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.160
Definitely...

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.980
I just feel the dream.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.720
It is indeed a dream...

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240
everything.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.540
Migi ...?

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.220
Migi? Are there any of you left?

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800
Shinichi-kun?

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Great...

01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.180
He will find me...

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440
He will surely come!

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080
Shinichi-kun?!

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.080
I'm sorry, I want to ask...

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:33.960
Come run, Shinichi-kun!

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.380
He is looking for me ~

01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.380
so let's run!

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.200
Wherever, we he will find us.

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.180
I have to stay.

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.000
Why should you Shinichi-kun?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I do not know!

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.820
But, I have to.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.900
I'll definitely be back.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.120
Here!

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.980
Your arm is missing.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.480
Give up already...

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.140
this is the end for you.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.820
There was always an echo in my head...

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.860
That if I had to kill someone!

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.700
That there's was a point,

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.120
to protect the life of another.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.760
Another?

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.120
Another creature like you?

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.300
To protect us.

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.920
What did you say?

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.020
It would be troublesome to
find another human...

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.840
not another human, but another one

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.920
That's you.

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.640
I have to put an end to all of this.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.580
To create a life for us.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480
Yo!

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480
Migi?!

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.700
your alive?

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.380
Suddenly I woke, Because I felt no danger.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.680
It's a plan C.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.420
You do this, It was you inside
him, but you remain Migi.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.640
Rejection, the toxins
in his body are revolting.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:03.560
They're trying to dominate his body.

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.360
This is our victory, Shinichi.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.660
Why, Why?

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.960
Do not you already know?

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.400
His body could not withstand
the toxins inside.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.920
Could not resist?

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.580
Terrible...

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.180
Enjoy it calmly.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.460
You have done enough, rest, my friend.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.480
This is the last monster.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:22.980
It has a very powerful heart.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.260
He was trying to reshape his head again.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.920
He's been crushed like this
before and reshaped again.

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.660
What? he can rise up again?

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.100
Chances are 50/50

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.340
Then, more reason to kill him now.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.860
We are just weak creatures.

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:51.820
Therefore...

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.180
Do not blame us.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.540
Don't you want to kill him?

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.000
Yes...

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.160
but we don't have to kill him

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.940
That is what you have decided.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.360
What is it?

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.580
He is not guilty.

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.980
But...

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.900
there is someone I have to protect.

01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:57.500
I'm sorry...

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:01.520
Yes...

01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:06.540
Humans...

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.400
are not perfect, but deserve to live.

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.600
Now is not the time to relax.

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.060
Just a little while...

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.460
Shinichi, I have been thinking about something...

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:20.940
What?

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.240
We monsters must be cursed.

01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:29.000
Yes... it's true, look at
what had happened.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.440
Starting from Tamiya and Goto,
and all the monster like them.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.380
and you?

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800
I don't know...

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.060
Maybe things will be different...

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:52.440
But I can not stay, or I will
end up like them.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.240
What?

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.120
It's time for me to go.

01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:58.740
Go?

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.760
Shinichi, It is time for us to part.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.560
What do you mean?

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:07.340
If I stay here, it only
will cause problems.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.520
I must go.

01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.100
go where?

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.960
I will go to sleep.

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:25.500
I will sleep for a long time.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.560
Several years, decades, or perhaps to death.

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.820
You still want your right hand
back to normal, right?

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.100
Wait a minute...

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.400
Do not worry about me.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.800
I will just disable myself.

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:44.120
I think this is a chance for me...

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.140
...to start a new journey.

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.760
I just want you to know in case
this is all just a dream.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.300
just a dream?

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.260
You are not serious?

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.640
Yes, I am serious.

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:06.380
We've become friends for a long time.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.460
but it is time we walk alone.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:13.680
Migi...

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:17.080
It is time for me to go.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080
Wait...

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:20.920
Migi...

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.380
Will you ever come back again?

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:25.700
Maybe.

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:30.600
Anyway, talking to your right hand is strange.

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.340
It is time for you to forget this
bad dream,

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.820
and to forget about me.

01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:41.380
Wait, Migi...

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.520
You need to have a normal right hand.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.880
As you would expect, a right hand.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.480
Migi...

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.940
Shinichi...

01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:58.840
Thank you for everything.

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:08.580
Migi?

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.360
Migi?

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.800
Migi don't go Migi! Migi wake up!

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.260
Do not be stupid...

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.160
You're actually gone...

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.620
Your are just a right hand.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.680
It is impossible to forget you.

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.580
It is impossible to
forget you!

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.480
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:15.440
You are always late...

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.400
never thinking of others.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.480
Only one I think.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.440
Tamiya Taiki-kun?

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.020
Taiki...

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.060
He's gotten fat.

01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.740
Are you going to get me coffee...

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.180
coffee?

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.320
Yeah...

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.640
What is coffee?

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.260
Come on you promised, you said you would...

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:57.300
alright?

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.140
Thank you...

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.380
Damn!

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.160
Quit moving so much!

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.260
What are you doing with her?

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.160
Beautiful...

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.480
So scared she couldn't even speak.

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:15.940
What are you doing?

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:19.220
You may not know me,

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.140
but I know you very well.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.640
So I wanted to ask...

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.440
a monster.

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.300
May be more appropriate
a killer.

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:38.600
Like me.

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.180
what am I?

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.420
Why do I kill?

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.620
The answer is, because I am human.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.860
Man from the beginning men
have been killing each other, right?

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.680
Because they are killers.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.000
So, I want to ask another monster.

01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.740
Am I really human?

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:16.740
Tell me!

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.200
I was...

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:36.540
I was a monster ~.

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600
Shinichi-kun!

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.820
You do not need to answer him.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.040
Is there any part of you that is human?

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:50.480
Now the scared one speaks

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.600
I'm not afraid of you

01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.080
Do whatever you want.

01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.440
enough Satomi.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.540
Shinichi-kun was human.

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:09.940
People always have a reason to live
no matter how small it is.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.120
but you are the real monster!

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720
Satomi...

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.060
It's okay...

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.420
I will save you.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:07.740
Believe...

01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:56.540
Why...

01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.320
Why?!

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.880
what...

01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:18.180
What you've never seen a dead dog?

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.720
It just a puppy...

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.560
it can not be sad?

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.320
That's because, humans are different.

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:35.000
That is, what makes us survive.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.960
Because human beings, can love.

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:42.140
Always asking your hand for help.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.740
Therefore, Shinichi, is always hesitant.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.840
Believe in yourself.

01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.620
Satomi?

01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.400
Satomi?

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:05.300
Satomi!

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.420
Are you okay?

01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:14.820
Emm...

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:39.040
Migi?

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.760
its me right?

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:53.400
yes it is you?

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:08.940
Thank you migi...

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.220
Satomi...

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.060
Hmm?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Do you remember...

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.320
when that puppy died I
threw it into the trash?

01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.360
I can not forget about it...

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.040
I always think about it.

01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.360
Like a bad nightmare

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:15.660
That Shinichi-kun...

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.820
is my Shinichi-kun.
