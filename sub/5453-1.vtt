02:28.278 --> 02:29.267
What?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.275
I keep thinking about Hawaii, right now.

02:33.117 --> 02:34.641
My heart's in Hawaii.

02:35.319 --> 02:38.914
How the hell can your heart be in Hawaii
when you've never been there?

02:39.056 --> 02:41.650
You mean there's no place
you'd rather be than here?

02:42.026 --> 02:45.587
I'm just saying I don't know
how you can think about Hawaii right now.

02:45.996 --> 02:49.567
If I was in Hawaii right now,
I wouldn't think about being here.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.992
- See the difference?
- No.

02:53.404 --> 02:56.573
I'm not in Hawaii. I'm here, right?

02:56.673 --> 02:59.276
I don't want to be here.
I want to be in Hawaii.

02:59.376 --> 03:01.276
But I can't be in Hawaii.

03:01.478 --> 03:05.505
Therefore, I think about it so as not
to get depressed about being here.

03:07.785 --> 03:10.183
- But I'm here.
- Right.

03:10.721 --> 03:12.523
- I don't want to be here.
- Right.

03:12.623 --> 03:16.184
But I can't be anyplace else,
'cause all I see is this shit.

03:16.293 --> 03:19.751
Now, how do you get around that?
That's what I'm asking you.

03:21.298 --> 03:22.424
Focus.

03:24.501 --> 03:25.661
"Focus."

03:29.940 --> 03:31.271
It's time.

03:31.742 --> 03:34.267
No more Hawaii. Focus on this.

03:40.584 --> 03:41.380
Yeah?

03:41.985 --> 03:45.421
- Aloha.
- Aloha my ass, Divinci.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.790
Left at the corner.

04:28.665 --> 04:30.155
What's up?

04:30.300 --> 04:32.268
Hope you don't mind
me checking for weapons.

04:32.369 --> 04:34.538
- Yeah. I do mind.
- Yeah.

04:34.638 --> 04:37.573
What the fuck do I want
a man's hands on my body for?

04:38.475 --> 04:39.703
Hold it.

04:42.312 --> 04:44.143
Okay, check him.

04:48.585 --> 04:49.882
Check good.

04:49.987 --> 04:52.182
There's a lot of good hiding spots
on this body.

04:53.790 --> 04:57.123
- Watch out. That's the loot.
- He's got nothin'.

04:57.694 --> 04:59.252
So, what you got?

05:16.847 --> 05:18.371
Not bad at all.

05:18.715 --> 05:20.740
Any more where this came from?

05:20.918 --> 05:22.078
Maybe.

05:22.653 --> 05:24.746
Then maybe we talk again.

05:24.988 --> 05:26.148
Maybe.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.227
Yeah.

05:34.331 --> 05:38.097
Told you there was
a lot of good hiding places on this body.

05:42.739 --> 05:45.867
Bet you got a lot of good hiding spots
on that body, too.

06:52.342 --> 06:54.242
Come on, man, hurry up!

06:58.048 --> 06:59.572
Let's go! Let's go!

07:28.845 --> 07:30.107
Joe.

07:31.248 --> 07:32.237
Wake up.

07:33.483 --> 07:35.713
Get out of the street
before you get run over.

07:45.729 --> 07:47.219
Other way, Joe.

07:50.867 --> 07:54.030
Forget it.
I don't think you'd feel it anyway.

08:06.983 --> 08:09.781
- What the fuck?
- Keeping some late hours?

08:10.454 --> 08:13.548
Come on, man! What the fuck
are my neighbors gonna think?

08:13.657 --> 08:17.149
I apologize. I understand your concerns.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.457
You must also understand that,
unlike a bank...

08:20.831 --> 08:25.165
I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient
encouragement to repay one's debts.

08:25.268 --> 08:29.840
Therefore, I am forced
to hire the likes of Mr. Cutlass Supreme...

08:29.940 --> 08:33.398
whom, I might add,
contributes significantly to my overhead.

08:33.677 --> 08:37.114
I'm the real loser here,
and I'm concerned about your sincerity...

08:37.214 --> 08:41.717
in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt...

08:41.818 --> 08:43.751
that is one week past due.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.048
What can you do to reassure me
of your good intentions?

08:48.191 --> 08:51.058
I can make your life fucking miserable,
that's what I can do.

08:51.228 --> 08:52.559
Look at me.

08:53.397 --> 08:55.388
Do I have a wife and three kids?

08:55.499 --> 08:58.335
Do I have a good job at IBM?
Am I a handsome guy?

08:58.435 --> 08:59.902
No, no and no.

09:00.103 --> 09:03.006
I loan money at excessively
high interest rates...

09:03.106 --> 09:06.166
to pricks like you
who can't control their urge...

09:06.309 --> 09:09.746
to lose big money playing cards.
Then I have to stay up all night...

09:09.846 --> 09:12.316
trying to convince them
that I have needs, too.

09:12.416 --> 09:16.614
The point of which is,
I already have a fucking miserable life...

09:17.087 --> 09:20.657
so don't threaten me,
you lousy bag of cat shit.

09:20.757 --> 09:22.224
You fuckin'...

09:26.062 --> 09:28.826
All I'm asking is
that you be responsible.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.330
Is that unreasonable?

09:38.508 --> 09:39.998
That's $4,000.

09:41.178 --> 09:42.406
That's all I got.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.608
I'm proportionally reassured.

09:46.016 --> 09:48.507
You purchased yourself an extension.

10:02.432 --> 10:05.458
Another day, another body.
Where do you want to start?

10:07.170 --> 10:09.506
- A hit?
- Yeah. It looks like it.

10:09.606 --> 10:10.971
Could be gang related.

10:11.408 --> 10:15.310
Happened some time last night.
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

10:18.048 --> 10:19.783
Got an African-American male.

10:19.883 --> 10:22.953
Looks like he's in his 30s,
but even that's a guess.

10:23.053 --> 10:24.955
Half his head is on the upholstery.

10:25.055 --> 10:27.717
- Got any witnesses?
- Sure. Hundreds.

10:35.999 --> 10:37.466
Fucking animals!

10:37.801 --> 10:41.328
- Shotgun shells, 12-gauge.
- Three shotgun shells, 12-gauge.

10:41.471 --> 10:45.066
Hey, Divinci. Heard you got
a gang related, you lucky guy.

10:45.208 --> 10:49.201
- Yeah, one less drugstore on the street.
- The world's a safer place.

10:49.479 --> 10:51.140
- Thanks.
- No problem.

11:26.216 --> 11:27.376
Brown?

11:28.585 --> 11:29.745
Blond?

11:30.220 --> 11:32.017
Blond like Mel Gibson?

11:33.723 --> 11:35.588
Want to go for a ride?

11:36.493 --> 11:37.790
Why, did you get it?

11:37.894 --> 11:41.728
As of last night, partner,
I have enough to make the down.

11:42.432 --> 11:46.334
Picture me under some swaying palms,
sipping on a Mai tai.

11:46.436 --> 11:49.894
You got primary on the drug related
this morning on 27th?

11:50.307 --> 11:51.942
We're working on it right now.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.611
- Who's your second?
- Rodriguez.

11:54.711 --> 11:57.874
- In my office, both of you.
- Why?

11:58.181 --> 11:59.443
Now.

12:02.652 --> 12:03.787
Let me finish this.

12:03.887 --> 12:06.219
No, no, no. Come on. Come on!

12:10.994 --> 12:12.395
Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez...

12:12.495 --> 12:15.225
this is Richard Simms.
He's with the DEA.

12:15.332 --> 12:18.358
He wants to ask you some
questions about your case.

12:18.668 --> 12:21.000
- What's the occasion?
- You get an ID on the victim?

12:21.237 --> 12:24.875
- Still waiting on the prints.
- Car was registered to...

12:24.975 --> 12:27.535
Anchor Imports. '81 El Dorado, black.

12:30.914 --> 12:35.578
- If you got this, what do you want with us?
- The man in the car was Lionel Hudd.

12:35.785 --> 12:38.855
How does he know that?
What the hell's going on here, Captain?

12:38.955 --> 12:40.786
Hudd was DEA, undercover.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.620
He was working a case
on syndicate distribution of narcotics...

12:45.729 --> 12:48.391
but every dealer we tagged
kept getting killed.

12:48.632 --> 12:50.930
We finally got a lead on a girl.

12:54.404 --> 12:59.034
Hudd was a friend of mine, and I'm gonna
nail the son of a bitch who killed him.

13:09.152 --> 13:10.346
Look...

13:10.954 --> 13:13.514
we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.791
- A cop's a cop, right?
- That's right.

13:31.908 --> 13:32.966
Shit!

13:34.711 --> 13:37.814
- Fucking dumb fuck. What a dumb fuck!
- All right, just calm down.

13:37.914 --> 13:39.683
Why didn't you fucking frisk him?

13:39.783 --> 13:42.852
- Calm down for a second.
- You didn't think to fuckin' search him?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.187
Just calm down! You hear me?

13:44.287 --> 13:47.190
- You killed a fucking cop!
- Calm the fuck down!

13:47.290 --> 13:50.453
Calm the fuck down!
Goddamn son of a bitch!

13:50.560 --> 13:53.396
Get your fucking hands off me, fucker.

13:53.496 --> 13:55.760
You just calm the fuck down!
You understand me?

13:55.899 --> 13:57.867
You fucking understand me?

14:01.304 --> 14:04.273
I want you to shut up
and fucking listen to me for a second.

14:04.674 --> 14:07.837
They could be watching us right now,
you asshole.

14:09.112 --> 14:10.443
Let me go.

14:11.381 --> 14:13.315
Get in the fucking car.

14:27.931 --> 14:30.399
Now look,
there's no fucking reason to panic.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.670
No fucking reason to panic?
This ain't no fucking reason to panic?

14:33.770 --> 14:36.136
Stop being an idiot. All right?

14:36.339 --> 14:38.508
We're the cops on this case.
This is our case.

14:38.608 --> 14:42.044
- We're gonna find the fucking killer.
- We are the fucking killers!

14:42.445 --> 14:44.379
Since when does that matter?

14:59.129 --> 15:03.065
All they want is someone to go down
for the crime. Right?

15:03.633 --> 15:05.965
Do we care who goes down for the crime?
Fuck, no.

15:06.069 --> 15:08.338
As long as someone goes down
for the crime.

15:08.438 --> 15:10.838
It's a slot that's gotta be filled.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.776
"Slot to be filled."

15:15.111 --> 15:17.047
Frank, we killed a fucking cop.

15:17.147 --> 15:19.716
- That doesn't bother you?
- Of course it bothers me.

15:19.816 --> 15:23.586
What the hell you want me to do?
Turn myself in? I'm not gonna do that.

15:23.686 --> 15:25.855
Look, this is a risk we take
every goddamn day.

15:25.955 --> 15:28.825
Somebody might pop us,
especially undercover like that.

15:28.925 --> 15:31.485
So somebody got popped.
He got popped. It happens.

15:31.694 --> 15:33.457
"It happens." He's a fucking cop!

15:33.563 --> 15:35.724
You don't get popped by cops
when you're a cop!

15:35.832 --> 15:38.801
I patted him down.
He had no badge. He had no gun.

15:38.902 --> 15:42.605
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
How was I supposed to fucking know?

15:42.705 --> 15:45.175
You patted him down?
You couldn't feel a fucking wire?

15:45.275 --> 15:48.938
No. He had no badge, nothing.
I'm telling you, he was a fucking idiot.

15:49.312 --> 15:52.076
But we got to start thinking
about us here, man.

15:52.482 --> 15:55.985
The important thing
is not to lose control of this case.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.153
Yeah.

15:57.253 --> 16:00.586
Whatever evidence there is,
it's got to go through us.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.784
We lay down a trail,
we make it nice and logical.

16:04.294 --> 16:08.788
We're the teachers and two and two
can add up to five if it's our classroom.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.725
So what are you saying?

16:12.836 --> 16:16.005
- You're saying we stick this to somebody?
- Yeah.

16:16.105 --> 16:19.008
Evidence points to wherever
the fuck we want it to point.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.370
Too fucking weird.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.512
We can provide so much
fucking evidence...

16:22.612 --> 16:26.275
that even the asshole we pick
will think he fucking killed him.

16:29.919 --> 16:32.388
- So you got an asshole in mind?
- Don't worry.

16:32.488 --> 16:33.790
"Don't worry."

16:33.890 --> 16:37.189
We'll find a killer.
There's lots of them out there.

16:38.061 --> 16:39.460
Come on.

17:29.579 --> 17:31.706
What the fuck did I do now?

17:41.758 --> 17:43.783
What the fuck is all this for?

17:44.027 --> 17:48.361
Do we look like fucking track stars to you?
We're here to fucking run?

17:58.775 --> 18:01.544
- Yo, man, that ain't my gun.
- Never is, is it?

18:01.644 --> 18:04.714
- It ain't my fucking gun.
- It's got your fucking prints.

18:04.814 --> 18:07.578
Know somethin'? You know what? Whatever.

18:09.719 --> 18:12.210
Where were you last Friday night?

18:12.555 --> 18:13.749
Friday night?

18:14.424 --> 18:17.723
- Last Friday night?
- Come on, am I fucking talking to myself?

18:17.827 --> 18:20.125
Where were you last Friday night?

18:20.430 --> 18:23.991
Whatever the hell I was supposed to
have done happened last Friday night?

18:24.100 --> 18:27.592
You better have a good alibi, James,
or it's good Ali-bye-bye.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.810
I was in jail all night. Check it out.

18:33.910 --> 18:37.846
Y'all ain't got nothin' on me!
So y'all can just let me go right now.

18:39.349 --> 18:40.407
What's up?

18:41.417 --> 18:43.044
Freeze! Police!

18:43.186 --> 18:44.787
Shut the fuck up!

18:44.887 --> 18:47.323
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground right now!

18:47.423 --> 18:49.482
Down on the fucking ground!

18:49.659 --> 18:51.456
- Shut the fuck up!
- Here, take them!

18:51.561 --> 18:53.963
God damn it! My fucking shoulder!

18:54.063 --> 18:57.089
That's the last motherfucking time
I open the goddamn door!

19:01.637 --> 19:02.605
Ain't my gun.

19:02.705 --> 19:05.230
That's funny,
it's got your fingerprints on it.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.667
- Fuck! I never seen that gun...
- Get the fuck down!

19:14.050 --> 19:15.642
Where were you Friday night?

19:16.152 --> 19:17.887
Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer.

19:17.987 --> 19:20.156
A lawyer? What are you, stupid?

19:20.256 --> 19:24.317
You think a hotshot lawyer will
come in here and save your ass? Hell, no.

19:24.494 --> 19:27.327
All the evidence we have
points to you, Cortez.

19:29.932 --> 19:32.127
Did you say last Friday night?

19:32.435 --> 19:33.993
Yeah, that's right.

19:36.372 --> 19:39.242
Intensive care,
you pendejo fucking gutter shits.

19:39.342 --> 19:44.177
And Thursday night and Saturday, too.
I just fucking got out this morning.

19:47.617 --> 19:49.886
Shit! All right, all right, all right.

19:49.986 --> 19:53.820
- I ain't gonna fight you.
- I know you're not gonna fucking fight.

19:59.495 --> 20:00.723
Ain't my gun.

20:01.230 --> 20:03.824
- That's what they all say.
- I wish it was.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.796
No better gun than a Smitty & Wes,
.44 mag.

20:11.741 --> 20:14.175
With the serial numbers filed off.

20:15.845 --> 20:17.403
Got any bullets?

20:20.149 --> 20:22.947
- Who did I kill?
- Where were you last Friday night?

20:24.520 --> 20:27.614
- You mean, what's my alibi, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:30.093 --> 20:31.651
I was breaking and entering.

20:31.761 --> 20:36.198
Jewelry store on Seventh and Front
about 9:00.

20:36.632 --> 20:41.262
Not even close to your jurisdiction.
And I got the rocks to prove it.

20:43.072 --> 20:45.438
Sorry I can't help you guys...

20:46.242 --> 20:49.370
but one to five is way better
than 10 to life.

20:49.612 --> 20:51.580
You know what I'm saying?

20:53.616 --> 20:56.085
Look, this is our case,
not the goddamn DEA's.

20:56.185 --> 20:57.982
It's been three days.

20:58.488 --> 21:01.657
Look, we're not fucking magicians here.
It's only three days.

21:01.757 --> 21:04.624
This is a big goddamn murder case.
We need a little time.

21:05.528 --> 21:07.553
When a federal undercover officer
goes down...

21:07.663 --> 21:09.499
it's never a fucking murder case.

21:09.599 --> 21:13.169
Look, I don't like the DEA on my ass
any more than you like them on yours...

21:13.269 --> 21:16.067
but this is personal for them,
and they want answers.

21:16.272 --> 21:20.436
Forget your other cases and get me
something, anything I can give to them.

21:20.543 --> 21:23.446
The last thing I want
is the goddamn FBI on my back, too.

21:23.546 --> 21:26.413
All right, we got a few leads.
We'll follow up.

21:26.649 --> 21:28.549
I can't hold them off much longer.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.684
This is bullshit.

21:32.555 --> 21:34.357
And you both know it. No disrespect...

21:34.457 --> 21:36.893
but this is no way to run
a fucking investigation!

21:36.993 --> 21:38.119
Easy.

21:38.895 --> 21:40.886
Let me tell you both something.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.056
If you don't solve this quick,
they're gonna start asking why.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.936
And they'll want to blame
somebody in this department.

21:47.036 --> 21:52.030
Get something fuckin' fast, or turn over
what you've got and get out of the way.

21:58.648 --> 22:00.275
That's it, baby!

22:38.554 --> 22:41.387
I think this is breaking and entering,
isn't it?

22:41.557 --> 22:44.287
I work homicide. I don't work that shit.

22:44.427 --> 22:46.622
Did you learn anything
you didn't already know?

22:46.762 --> 22:49.754
Yeah. You surprise me sometimes.

22:50.366 --> 22:53.970
I think you're just a hard case,
and I discover you got a heart of gold.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.469
Organ donor?

22:58.241 --> 22:59.799
That's really nice.

23:00.643 --> 23:04.046
- Too bad they'll never use your best parts.
- I'll make sure you get them.

23:04.146 --> 23:06.080
Thank you. I appreciate that.

23:09.252 --> 23:11.948
I just think it's real nice, that's all.

23:12.255 --> 23:15.452
I'm surprised we got
something in common besides...

23:16.425 --> 23:18.256
what we got in common.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.397
What's so interesting out there?

23:26.836 --> 23:28.963
I'm just thinking, that's all.

23:30.339 --> 23:31.772
About us?

23:32.675 --> 23:33.767
No.

23:37.747 --> 23:38.839
Good.

23:45.288 --> 23:47.056
What if I was thinking about us?

23:47.156 --> 23:50.125
- Don't waste your time.
- What if I was?

23:51.160 --> 23:54.288
- Where's it gonna get us?
- Maybe I got plans.

23:54.397 --> 23:56.957
Yeah, I don't want to hear them.

23:57.266 --> 24:01.032
Plans just make you think
that something's gonna get better.

24:01.404 --> 24:06.068
I'm fine. I don't need to get screwed up
waiting for something good to happen.

24:09.278 --> 24:12.381
I want you to know
that love is important to me.

24:12.481 --> 24:15.780
- Me, too.
- But more important is loyalty...

24:16.352 --> 24:18.684
'cause loyalty is about respect.

24:21.857 --> 24:23.722
And I'm loyal to you...

24:24.527 --> 24:26.654
like I am loyal to my partner.

24:27.063 --> 24:30.590
We are closer than blood,
and I trust him with my life.

24:31.467 --> 24:32.832
Why are you telling me?

24:34.570 --> 24:38.904
'Cause when you asked me if I was
thinking about us and I said I wasn't...

24:40.176 --> 24:41.939
I want you to know...

24:42.778 --> 24:43.767
I do.

24:53.456 --> 24:54.787
God damn it!

24:59.128 --> 25:00.720
Fucking idiot!

25:03.599 --> 25:05.157
Get out of here.

25:10.005 --> 25:11.165
Asshole.

25:33.295 --> 25:34.819
What do we have here?

25:39.402 --> 25:41.996
Where were you last Friday night?

25:43.773 --> 25:45.297
What's your name?

25:47.710 --> 25:49.769
Your name. Your name.

25:50.379 --> 25:52.074
What's your name?

25:55.050 --> 25:56.517
Joe.

25:57.787 --> 25:58.913
Joe.

26:01.257 --> 26:03.350
Where'd you get the gun, Joe?

26:06.662 --> 26:09.495
It was in your pocket, your coat pocket.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.200
Must carry it for protection, Joe?

26:14.703 --> 26:16.227
I don't know.

26:16.439 --> 26:18.031
Sure you do, Joe.

26:18.941 --> 26:21.034
Everybody needs protection.

26:21.544 --> 26:23.910
Especially a guy like you
who lives on the street.

26:26.382 --> 26:28.577
Go ahead and put it away, Joe.

26:29.385 --> 26:33.048
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.187
Put it in your pocket.

26:38.694 --> 26:39.683
Wake up.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.896
Joe, wake up.
You might wanna look at something.

26:45.067 --> 26:46.500
Out the window, Joe.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.705
Come on. Look out the window.

26:51.574 --> 26:54.941
This is where it happened, Joe.
You remember?

26:56.078 --> 26:58.740
This is where you killed him.
Right here.

26:59.081 --> 27:00.446
Look, look, Joe.

27:01.584 --> 27:03.419
This is where you did it.
Do you remember?

27:03.519 --> 27:06.355
Remember how you pulled
the gun out and shot him in the head?

27:06.455 --> 27:07.820
I don't.

27:11.126 --> 27:12.320
You will.

27:31.313 --> 27:33.440
Come on, Joe. Time to get up.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.846
Time to get up, Joe.

27:36.819 --> 27:39.344
Come on. Get those photographs.

27:40.089 --> 27:41.386
Get up, Joe.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.217
Shit, this fucker smells.

27:46.228 --> 27:50.130
I want you to look at something here.
There's the guy. There's the car.

27:52.368 --> 27:53.630
Joe!

27:54.537 --> 27:56.437
Tell me how you shot him.

27:58.741 --> 28:01.574
Come on, Joe.
Bring that booze over here.

28:02.678 --> 28:05.078
Remember,
and I'll give you something to drink.

28:05.314 --> 28:06.645
Joe?

28:07.216 --> 28:10.481
You've got to remember
how you saw him driving towards you...

28:10.653 --> 28:12.555
and you were in the street...

28:12.655 --> 28:15.057
and you were afraid
that he was gonna hit you...

28:15.157 --> 28:16.920
so you shot him...

28:17.560 --> 28:19.824
to protect yourself, Joe, Right?

28:20.996 --> 28:23.396
You remember now, don't you, Joe?

28:25.834 --> 28:27.301
The gun, Joe?

28:27.670 --> 28:29.331
Where do you keep the gun, Joe?

28:29.772 --> 28:31.967
Where do you keep the gun, Joe?

28:45.521 --> 28:47.113
There you go, Joe.

28:58.601 --> 29:02.230
I know it's tough to remember things
you don't want to remember, Joe.

29:02.838 --> 29:04.100
Okay, Joe.

29:05.374 --> 29:06.932
Now, tell me...

29:08.077 --> 29:09.601
what happened?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.345
How did it happen, Joe?

29:16.352 --> 29:20.448
- You saw him driving towards you.
- Saw him driving towards me.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.988
- You were in the street.
- I was in the street.

29:53.222 --> 29:54.246
Then what did you do?

30:03.332 --> 30:05.095
You ran.

30:06.535 --> 30:08.298
I ran.

30:10.472 --> 30:11.564
I didn't mean to.

30:12.441 --> 30:16.002
He was gonna hit me.
I was really scared.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.745
- That's why you shot him.
- That's why I shot him.

30:19.481 --> 30:23.285
- I didn't mean to.
- It's all right, you gotta protect yourself.

30:23.385 --> 30:25.148
I was really scared.

30:27.389 --> 30:29.152
That's why I...

30:31.193 --> 30:33.286
You shot him.

30:40.836 --> 30:42.599
Hell of a shot, Joe.

30:52.481 --> 30:55.245
You're doing
the right thing for yourself, Joe.

30:56.418 --> 30:57.386
- You got it?
- Yep.

30:57.486 --> 30:58.578
All right.

31:08.597 --> 31:09.529
Hey, baby.

31:09.732 --> 31:12.167
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the day.

31:12.267 --> 31:13.666
Just talk.

31:14.136 --> 31:15.603
Since when?

31:22.511 --> 31:24.308
I need you to do something.

31:24.413 --> 31:25.814
Good. I need the money.

31:25.914 --> 31:28.974
No, it's not one of those deals.
Something else altogether.

31:29.151 --> 31:32.086
- Where you going?
- I got perishables, baby.

31:32.921 --> 31:36.322
Know the guy we did the deal with
the other night? He's dead.

31:36.825 --> 31:39.953
- What?
- Yeah. Somebody popped him that night.

31:40.262 --> 31:42.856
Probably when he was unloading the stuff.
I don't know.

31:42.965 --> 31:46.924
- Look, does anybody think that...
- Don't worry about that.

31:47.369 --> 31:50.736
They can't connect us.
Besides, we got the guy who did it.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.234
You scared the hell out of me.

31:54.743 --> 31:58.179
- But I need you to do one thing for me.
- Yeah, what?

31:58.413 --> 31:59.539
It's simple.

32:02.451 --> 32:04.586
He'll be second from the left.
Don't fuck up.

32:04.686 --> 32:07.289
- Second from the left.
- And what am I supposed to say?

32:07.389 --> 32:10.025
You look at them,
and then you look at the man...

32:10.125 --> 32:11.558
and you say, "It's him."

32:11.994 --> 32:15.330
- And I ask you if you're sure.
- And you say, "Absolutely. No question."

32:15.430 --> 32:16.624
And this is all I have to do?

32:16.732 --> 32:19.501
He confessed.
You ID him, he's going straight to the can.

32:19.601 --> 32:21.870
Okay, but this is it.
I'm not doing anything more.

32:21.970 --> 32:25.337
It's a done deal.
Will you quit complaining? Come on.

32:27.376 --> 32:31.278
All the way in, down to right there.
All the way down, now.

32:32.648 --> 32:33.615
Okay.

32:33.715 --> 32:36.285
- Stop and face front.
- Turn around.

32:36.385 --> 32:38.319
Lift your heads. Look straight.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.281
Okay, Miss Webb.

32:41.890 --> 32:43.414
Now, take your time.

32:43.725 --> 32:45.386
Try to remember his face.

32:47.129 --> 32:49.029
I know him.

32:51.867 --> 32:53.061
If you can identify the man...

32:53.335 --> 32:55.571
- No, I know him.
- Choose him for us.

32:55.671 --> 32:58.507
- No, I fucking know him.
- What's the problem?

32:58.607 --> 33:00.131
Do you see him up there?

33:00.576 --> 33:02.908
You don't understand.

33:05.848 --> 33:07.873
Just pick the asshole out.

33:08.217 --> 33:09.650
No talking.

33:13.689 --> 33:15.418
Number two!

33:20.762 --> 33:22.286
Number two, Jimmy.

33:24.533 --> 33:28.697
- I can't believe this shit.
- Step forward. The rest of you go on out.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.242
What the hell was that about?

33:33.342 --> 33:36.311
I know him!
He hangs around my building in the alley.

33:36.411 --> 33:39.915
People who hang around your
neighborhood aren't capable of killing?

33:40.015 --> 33:41.817
You don't live in a great neighborhood!

33:41.917 --> 33:44.750
- Sign the goddamn paper.
- What paper?

33:45.220 --> 33:48.724
When you pick a guy out of a lineup,
you gotta sign a paper that says so...

33:48.824 --> 33:50.492
or they'll think we made the shit up.

33:50.592 --> 33:53.755
Yeah? Why would they think
something like that?

33:53.862 --> 33:55.295
Just sign it.

33:55.597 --> 33:58.000
I thought you said
all I had to do was pick him out.

33:58.100 --> 34:01.695
This is just part of it.
You sign it, and you're finished.

34:02.738 --> 34:05.774
- How come you're so sure he did it?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

34:05.874 --> 34:07.943
- He confessed.
- Bullshit!

34:08.043 --> 34:11.045
- Lady, we got the confession on paper.
- He didn't do it!

34:11.146 --> 34:15.310
Yeah? How the hell you know that?
Were you with him at the time?

34:15.516 --> 34:17.252
Are you gonna be his goddamn alibi?

34:17.351 --> 34:19.788
- She was probably blowing him.
- Better him than you.

34:19.888 --> 34:22.413
- I can't afford you.
- Shut the fuck up!

34:25.726 --> 34:26.751
Now, look...

34:26.862 --> 34:29.297
This is what they call
an open-and-shut case.

34:29.398 --> 34:32.389
He did the kill,
and he's going fuckin' down!

34:34.436 --> 34:38.496
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know the right fucking thing to do.

34:38.607 --> 34:40.905
Now just sign the goddamn thing!

34:46.114 --> 34:46.909
Fuck.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.212
Bring him down here.

34:54.156 --> 34:56.056
Warden.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.684
Damn, man, you smell him?

35:29.691 --> 35:30.885
"Doe"?

35:32.227 --> 35:33.785
He wouldn't give us his last name.

35:34.896 --> 35:38.354
He signed a confession,
but he wouldn't give you his last name?

35:38.967 --> 35:43.063
He couldn't remember it.
What can I say? The guy's a head case.

35:43.705 --> 35:47.641
- You run the prints?
- Yeah. No priors.

35:47.876 --> 35:49.537
Ballistics match?

35:50.779 --> 35:53.077
You know, you guys are funny.

35:54.049 --> 35:57.576
A.44 was used in commission.
We found a fucking.44 on him.

35:57.753 --> 36:00.916
It doesn't take a rocket scientist here,
guys. He did it.

36:01.023 --> 36:04.192
- Went down pretty quick.
- It's our street.

36:04.292 --> 36:07.386
- I think they did a hell of a job.
- God damn it!

36:09.631 --> 36:12.334
Some goddamn piece of shit
blows him away for nothing!

36:12.434 --> 36:13.401
Fuck.

36:20.242 --> 36:21.573
I'm sorry.

36:23.545 --> 36:28.141
Hudd was too good for this to happen.
I just didn't think he'd go down this way.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.040
It was good work.

36:30.352 --> 36:31.580
Thanks.

36:31.953 --> 36:33.113
Sorry.

36:34.122 --> 36:35.714
I appreciate it.

36:43.231 --> 36:45.634
Do me a favor.
Make sure this one sticks.

36:45.734 --> 36:48.066
I don't want these DEA assholes
back in here.

36:49.404 --> 36:51.929
Word is he killed a DEA undercover.

36:53.475 --> 36:55.344
Word is he signed a confession.

36:55.444 --> 36:59.608
Word is everyone's entitled to a defense,
no matter how guilty they...

37:01.817 --> 37:03.409
Shit.

37:05.153 --> 37:07.556
- Okay, Judy.
- He's detoxing.

37:07.656 --> 37:09.858
I gave him something
to help him through it.

37:09.958 --> 37:11.619
Can I talk to him?

37:22.804 --> 37:24.795
Joe, can you hear me?

37:28.543 --> 37:31.842
Joe, I'm Elliot Goff.

37:32.047 --> 37:34.515
Hi. I'm your attorney.

37:36.718 --> 37:37.878
Joe...

37:38.353 --> 37:40.947
You understand what I'm saying to you?

37:41.857 --> 37:43.017
Joe...

37:49.564 --> 37:52.931
And it was just two hours later,
on that same Friday night...

37:53.135 --> 37:54.569
when the defendant, Clyde Dunner...

37:54.669 --> 37:57.339
entered the home
of George and Carol Beeman...

37:57.439 --> 38:00.374
a.44 caliber pistol in his hand.

38:00.709 --> 38:03.644
He entered that house
with one thing in mind...

38:03.979 --> 38:06.004
to kill George and Carol.

38:06.515 --> 38:09.384
Why? Because those were
the two people...

38:09.484 --> 38:13.420
he blamed for the breakup
of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

38:14.189 --> 38:17.352
George and Carol were watching a movie.

38:18.393 --> 38:21.191
They were sitting on their couch
watching television...

38:21.296 --> 38:23.457
when the defendant
entered the living room...

38:23.565 --> 38:25.089
and opened fire.

38:25.700 --> 38:29.438
George was killed instantly, hit in the face,
and Carol died later...

38:29.538 --> 38:31.403
three bullet wounds to her chest.

38:32.174 --> 38:36.508
And then the defendant,
in an effort to cover up his crime...

38:37.512 --> 38:40.037
doused them both with lighter fluid...

38:40.515 --> 38:42.642
and set the house on fire.

38:44.886 --> 38:46.786
Carol was still alive.

38:48.190 --> 38:50.124
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

38:50.625 --> 38:53.560
we will prove to you
beyond any reasonable doubt...

38:53.962 --> 38:58.865
that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner,
is guilty of two counts of murder...

38:59.234 --> 39:00.701
in the first degree.

39:01.236 --> 39:03.329
The defense may now proceed.

39:07.676 --> 39:09.344
- Jesus Christ!
- I don't know where.

39:09.444 --> 39:11.780
- What's wrong?
- They can't find the murder weapon.

39:11.880 --> 39:15.050
- What are you talking about?
- They can't find the goddamn gun!

39:15.150 --> 39:17.516
- They lost it or something. Misplaced it.
- What?

39:18.587 --> 39:21.623
I don't have a goddamn case
without the goddamn gun!

39:21.723 --> 39:26.057
The fingerprints, the ballistics, everything.
I have to have the fucking gun.

39:26.761 --> 39:30.595
That murdering piece of slime
is gonna go free without the.44.

39:31.132 --> 39:32.861
How the fuck can they lose it?

39:34.402 --> 39:37.633
Yes. Eden, I want to speak
to Capt. Henderson.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.707
You used the Dunner gun?

39:39.808 --> 39:42.911
- I can't believe it!
- This is not my fuck-up.

39:43.011 --> 39:46.248
Why didn't you use the fucking gun
from the Kennedy murder?

39:46.348 --> 39:49.579
Listen, our shooting was supposed to be
gang related and unsolved.

39:49.684 --> 39:52.020
Only because we popped
a goddamn undercover cop...

39:52.120 --> 39:54.322
did we need to find
a fucking.44 for evidence.

39:54.422 --> 39:57.826
Otherwise, we would've never needed it,
so don't point your finger at me.

39:57.926 --> 40:00.952
All right, okay?
All fuckin' right. Fine.

40:01.062 --> 40:03.257
But you explain to me
how we got the same gun...

40:03.365 --> 40:05.600
for two murders
by two different fucking killers?

40:05.700 --> 40:07.691
And it's supposed to be
in police custody.

40:07.802 --> 40:10.338
All right. Don't explain it.
It's their fuck-up.

40:10.438 --> 40:12.307
They lost the goddamn evidence.

40:12.407 --> 40:15.243
Ballistics are already complete
in the Dunner's case.

40:15.343 --> 40:17.402
All we need is another gun.

40:19.381 --> 40:22.784
All my merchandise is in top condition.
Untraceable.

40:22.884 --> 40:24.715
We'll take the.44.

40:45.173 --> 40:47.403
Hi, Joe. I'm Elliot. We met the other...

40:48.977 --> 40:50.045
You weren't in good shape.

40:50.145 --> 40:53.114
You look better now. Have a seat.
We have to talk.

40:55.617 --> 40:56.811
About what I did?

40:57.218 --> 40:59.448
Yeah. Sit down.

40:59.888 --> 41:04.086
Before we get started, I want to go over
a couple of things with you first.

41:05.727 --> 41:08.924
Now, Joe is your first name.
I assume that's "Joseph."

41:10.398 --> 41:11.365
Okay.

41:13.802 --> 41:15.429
What about Doe?

41:16.071 --> 41:19.507
Is that what you told the officers
your last name was?

41:19.874 --> 41:21.209
I don't think so.

41:21.309 --> 41:24.301
What did you tell them
your last name was?

41:24.979 --> 41:26.640
I don't remember.

41:27.649 --> 41:29.583
Is Doe your last name?

41:33.588 --> 41:35.749
Do you know what your last name is?

41:36.157 --> 41:38.625
I would tell you if I could remember.

41:38.727 --> 41:42.094
Joe Smith? Joe Jones? Joe DiMaggio?

41:49.971 --> 41:51.165
All right. Okay.

41:51.573 --> 41:53.438
Do you have any family?

41:56.111 --> 41:58.045
Do you have any friends?

41:59.848 --> 42:01.281
I don't know.

42:03.184 --> 42:04.344
Joe, you...

42:04.819 --> 42:07.049
You don't know very much
about yourself, do you?

42:10.091 --> 42:12.787
But you remember the night
you shot the man in the car?

42:17.899 --> 42:18.923
Why?

42:22.103 --> 42:23.400
Because I can.

42:26.241 --> 42:27.606
I'm sorry, I'm not...

42:29.544 --> 42:30.875
much help.

42:37.018 --> 42:39.220
When you approached
the suspect in his apartment...

42:39.320 --> 42:41.389
did you identify yourself
as a police officer?

42:41.489 --> 42:42.424
Yes.

42:42.524 --> 42:44.793
- And did the suspect respond?
- Yes, he did.

42:44.893 --> 42:46.326
In what way?

42:47.462 --> 42:48.986
He shot through the door.

42:50.632 --> 42:54.502
He fired six times until his gun was empty.
Ladies and gentlemen...

42:54.602 --> 42:57.162
I would like to show you
the weapon that he used.

42:58.540 --> 43:01.202
A Smith & Wesson.44 caliber revolver.

43:01.509 --> 43:02.544
The same weapon...

43:02.644 --> 43:05.909
he used to viciously murder
George and Carol Beeman.

43:06.147 --> 43:09.173
I would like to enter it
into court records at this time.

43:09.617 --> 43:10.819
Thank you. Bailiff?

43:10.919 --> 43:12.784
Thank you, Mr. Divinci.

43:14.923 --> 43:19.155
At this time, the prosecution
would like to recall Mr. Steven J. Allen.

43:19.594 --> 43:21.755
Call Steven J. Allen.

43:29.838 --> 43:32.474
Could you remind the court
as to what you do, please?

43:32.574 --> 43:35.410
Sure. I'm a lab technician
for the police department.

43:35.510 --> 43:39.080
One of my duties is to examine
weapons used in violent crimes.

43:39.180 --> 43:42.417
I tested the defendant's revolver
and matched the bullets fired...

43:42.517 --> 43:44.652
to those removed
from the body of the deceased.

43:44.752 --> 43:45.741
That ain't my gun!

43:46.187 --> 43:48.556
I must remind the defendant
he is not to speak out.

43:48.656 --> 43:50.851
- That ain't my gun!
- Order in the court!

43:51.893 --> 43:53.292
That ain't my fucking gun!

43:59.734 --> 44:04.330
They're trying to fucking frame me!
That ain't my fucking gun!

44:08.176 --> 44:11.179
- We gotta put the right gun back.
- We can't put it back.

44:11.279 --> 44:13.474
Without that gun,
they won't convict Joe.

44:13.615 --> 44:15.583
Without that,
they'll let Clyde back out!

44:15.683 --> 44:19.414
I don't give a fuck about Clyde!
I give a fuck about us right now!

44:19.754 --> 44:22.891
Look, it's like you said.
He signed a confession, right?

44:22.991 --> 44:24.481
It's an open-and-shut case.

44:24.792 --> 44:26.760
I swear to God, Frank...

44:26.928 --> 44:30.364
if we let Clyde get back on the streets,
he's gonna kill again.

44:31.533 --> 44:34.969
How'd that little piece of fuckin' puke
know that wasn't his damn gun?

44:35.069 --> 44:36.536
Tell me that!

44:36.771 --> 44:40.775
I don't think he knows his own mother,
but he knows his own fucking gun?

44:40.875 --> 44:42.274
Bullshit!

44:43.278 --> 44:45.508
I don't think that's
important right now.

44:46.047 --> 44:47.412
I know it's not important!

44:50.351 --> 44:53.054
- Open up.
- Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.

44:53.154 --> 44:55.757
What do you mean you can't?
I gotta check something.

44:55.857 --> 44:59.258
- You got written permission?
- Since fuckin' when?

44:59.394 --> 45:02.955
Since an hour ago, when he ripped me
a new asshole big as a three-car garage.

45:03.064 --> 45:04.156
Okay, what's the problem?

45:04.265 --> 45:06.668
Something about missing evidence.
Who the hell knows?

45:06.768 --> 45:09.794
All I know is
I want to transfer the hell out of here.

45:10.104 --> 45:12.540
- What are we supposed to do?
- How should I know?

45:12.640 --> 45:16.406
Ask the fucking chief, all right?
Policy ain't my department.

45:19.347 --> 45:20.371
Thanks a lot.

45:20.748 --> 45:22.579
Whenever you're ready.

45:23.251 --> 45:24.886
Yes, we would like
to plead not guilty...

45:24.986 --> 45:27.522
to the charge of murder
for reason of insanity.

45:27.622 --> 45:29.657
- But I did it.
- Let me handle this.

45:29.757 --> 45:31.192
I signed the confession.

45:31.292 --> 45:34.887
Don't worry, I'm the attorney.
All right? Let me handle it.

45:34.996 --> 45:37.487
Your Honor, can we have
a moment, please?

45:37.832 --> 45:39.857
Counsel may approach the bench.

45:45.306 --> 45:47.909
My colleague's client
has admitted to the killing.

45:48.009 --> 45:50.411
I don't see any reason
to go through a trial...

45:50.511 --> 45:53.214
when it is obvious that the man
would like to plead guilty.

45:53.314 --> 45:54.482
I don't agree.

45:54.582 --> 45:56.784
If he wants to plead guilty,
you have to let him.

45:56.884 --> 45:59.287
- Not if he's not of sound mind.
- Come on, Elliot!

45:59.387 --> 46:01.356
- I think he's crazy.
- Sure. Of course he is.

46:01.456 --> 46:02.757
You think he's putting it on.

46:02.857 --> 46:05.519
That's DA's standard procedure.
But I don't think he is.

46:05.627 --> 46:07.254
So I'm standing by the not guilty...

46:07.362 --> 46:09.697
because I believe he's incapable
of sound judgment.

46:09.797 --> 46:12.857
- Have you had a psychiatrist look at him?
- Yes, Your Honor.

46:12.967 --> 46:17.199
I think you'll see that my diagnosis
is not without warrant.

46:21.376 --> 46:24.004
I'll review the findings
and make my decision tomorrow.

46:24.178 --> 46:26.772
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

46:28.249 --> 46:32.379
Besides, I hear there's a good chance
of beating the charges for lack of evidence.

46:40.695 --> 46:44.096
Nobody can connect us to the evidence.
We're clean there.

46:45.266 --> 46:47.291
The most important one
is the DEA mess, anyway.

46:47.402 --> 46:49.962
Once that's finished,
we're completely in the clear.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.868
You know we can't do this
anymore, Frank.

46:55.410 --> 46:57.845
Yeah. I guess.

46:57.945 --> 47:00.243
No. No fucking "I guess." That's it.

47:00.748 --> 47:01.976
No more!

47:04.686 --> 47:06.588
Good while it lasted, though.

47:06.688 --> 47:09.589
$100,000 a piece for a few nights' work?

47:10.725 --> 47:12.716
- That's not bad.
- You know, Frank...

47:13.861 --> 47:16.352
I think maybe what we did wasn't right.

47:16.798 --> 47:19.198
- I mean...
- Come on, man.

47:20.435 --> 47:21.459
Think about it.

47:22.804 --> 47:26.001
Look, we took out a few scumbags.
That's it, right?

47:26.841 --> 47:29.275
Nobody's ever gonna miss
those shitheads anyway.

47:29.510 --> 47:30.678
They were all garbage.

47:30.778 --> 47:32.871
None of them had a sheet
less than a mile long.

47:33.448 --> 47:35.916
Drugs, extortion, assault.

47:36.084 --> 47:39.542
They were all guilty and still on the street,
and you know that.

47:40.021 --> 47:41.511
All except the cop.

47:42.156 --> 47:43.748
Except the cop.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.296
That's just part of the job.

47:48.396 --> 47:50.660
It could have easily happened
to you or me.

47:50.765 --> 47:53.632
But that's just fucking it.
We are fucking cops.

47:53.901 --> 47:56.571
- We fucked up, man.
- We fucked up once.

47:56.671 --> 47:58.104
Once out of 10.

47:58.673 --> 48:00.538
Come on, that's not bad.

48:03.611 --> 48:05.480
All right, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

48:05.580 --> 48:08.378
The guy was in the wrong place
at the wrong fuckin' time.

48:08.716 --> 48:11.886
What do you want me to say?
I'm not going down for it.

48:11.986 --> 48:12.975
I know.

48:14.222 --> 48:16.691
I mean, all I want in life
is a goddamn fishing boat...

48:16.791 --> 48:19.282
a couple of drinks, a beach
and some Hawaiian music.

48:19.393 --> 48:23.659
That's not much to ask for 20 years putting
murdering assholes behind bars, is it?

48:27.535 --> 48:30.470
It's just not fair.
That's all I'm saying.

48:31.506 --> 48:34.805
And for a while, we made it fair.

48:37.645 --> 48:42.173
And quit thinking you're a bad guy.
You're not a fucking bad guy.

48:42.450 --> 48:43.644
All right?

48:43.818 --> 48:46.946
You made one mistake. Let it go.

48:47.455 --> 48:50.858
- I guess you're right.
- Damn right, I'm right.

48:50.958 --> 48:52.627
I just get worried, that's all.

48:52.727 --> 48:54.251
Worry!

48:54.962 --> 48:57.658
Worry. It's natural.
You should be worried a little bit.

48:57.765 --> 49:00.029
Shit, if you didn't worry,
I'd be worried.

49:00.902 --> 49:03.496
Just don't ever lose
your sense of humor.

49:05.373 --> 49:06.670
"Sense of humor."

49:07.375 --> 49:09.138
They're all garbage.

49:10.444 --> 49:12.435
Nothing wrong
with taking out the garbage.

49:14.615 --> 49:16.412
A lot of people don't know that.

49:18.119 --> 49:20.986
The defendant will stand
and face the jury.

49:21.622 --> 49:23.224
What is your verdict?

49:23.324 --> 49:26.919
We find the defendant,
Clyde David Dunner, not guilty.

49:28.229 --> 49:29.253
Yes!

49:30.832 --> 49:32.424
Fuckin' A, man.

49:32.867 --> 49:34.858
Thank you! Thank you!

49:42.844 --> 49:45.779
And you haven't seen him
any time since then?

49:46.113 --> 49:47.410
All right.

49:47.949 --> 49:50.818
- We gotta talk.
- Could you hold on one second, please?

49:50.918 --> 49:53.488
Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked, right?

49:53.588 --> 49:55.920
No. Joe's going to fucking trial.

49:57.625 --> 49:59.861
Judge found him mentally unfit to plead.

49:59.961 --> 50:03.397
His lawyer pleads
not guilty by reason of insanity.

50:03.698 --> 50:06.292
- You're fuckin' kidding me.
- I love to make people laugh.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.458
That's my life's work.

50:07.568 --> 50:11.205
Did you hear the one about the two cops
who popped a DEA agent?

50:11.305 --> 50:13.068
I'll call you right back.

50:16.043 --> 50:17.032
Hello?

50:17.278 --> 50:19.413
Divinci. It's Gardner.

50:19.513 --> 50:21.447
Sorry to call you so late, but...

50:22.049 --> 50:23.818
I got a really stressed out woman here.

50:23.918 --> 50:25.887
Said she needs to talk
to you about a murder.

50:25.987 --> 50:30.091
I told her I couldn't call you at home,
but she insists that it's very important.

50:30.191 --> 50:33.991
You know,
it's the "life and death" thing.

50:34.595 --> 50:36.256
What's her name?

50:37.665 --> 50:40.759
All right. Tell her to wait.
I'll be right there. Shit.

50:41.802 --> 50:44.862
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got to go down to the station.

50:44.972 --> 50:47.634
Now? Jesus, what time is it?

50:48.342 --> 50:49.744
Go back to sleep.

50:49.844 --> 50:52.814
Frank, this is no way
to repair our marriage, you know?

50:52.914 --> 50:54.404
Yeah, I know.

50:57.251 --> 50:59.082
Approximate weight?

51:00.021 --> 51:01.420
Color of hair?

51:01.589 --> 51:02.886
Gardner, this her?

51:03.124 --> 51:04.216
Yeah.

51:04.392 --> 51:05.757
How do you do?

51:05.960 --> 51:07.222
This way.

51:10.264 --> 51:12.494
- Frank, this guy came...
- Not now.

51:15.937 --> 51:18.339
I thought you said
all I had to do was pick him out...

51:18.439 --> 51:19.674
and that was all.

51:19.774 --> 51:22.543
- What are you talking about?
- Look! They want me in court!

51:22.643 --> 51:25.168
This is not what you promised, Frank.

51:25.446 --> 51:27.615
I can't go to court.
I can't do this, Frank.

51:27.715 --> 51:31.586
I cannot go to court. I can't do this.
I'm getting out of here. I gotta go.

51:31.686 --> 51:34.519
You're not getting out of here.
Get in. Shut up.

51:37.325 --> 51:38.690
Fuck!

51:40.895 --> 51:43.193
- I can't do this, Frank!
- Calm the fuck down!

51:43.297 --> 51:46.200
- No! I told you I can't do this!
- I warned you about this!

51:46.300 --> 51:50.104
Calm the fuck down for a second!
This was not supposed to happen!

51:50.204 --> 51:52.570
Just calm down!
Let me think for a second!

51:53.474 --> 51:55.810
Fine. Think. Think away.

51:55.910 --> 51:58.346
Think away. All right.

51:58.446 --> 52:01.973
Here. They want you to be a witness.
That's all, okay?

52:02.583 --> 52:04.385
There's nothing to worry about.

52:04.485 --> 52:05.952
You saw something happen.

52:06.253 --> 52:09.245
What, Frank? What did I see?

52:09.490 --> 52:12.391
I will tell you everything
you gotta know.

52:12.927 --> 52:14.656
Everything.

52:15.396 --> 52:17.887
I will tell you exactly what to say.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.729
Just like another stage.

52:20.835 --> 52:22.632
It's like dancing.

52:24.305 --> 52:25.272
Hi, Joe.

52:28.442 --> 52:29.534
You look much better.

52:30.011 --> 52:31.478
Jail has been good for me.

52:32.747 --> 52:35.583
Trial date is set for Thursday.
I just wanted to go over...

52:35.683 --> 52:40.288
I've been thinking about what I did,
and I don't think that it's right...

52:40.388 --> 52:41.878
that I should try getting off.

52:42.390 --> 52:43.457
Excuse me?

52:43.557 --> 52:45.218
I wanna plead guilty.

52:47.328 --> 52:49.023
I killed a man. I should be punished.

52:50.664 --> 52:52.256
I'm a little surprised.

52:52.767 --> 52:53.699
Why?

52:55.002 --> 52:58.105
Nobody ever wants to be punished
for what they've done.

52:58.205 --> 53:01.572
That is a totally new concept for me,
believe me.

53:02.410 --> 53:04.946
But listen, I still think
our defense is reasonable.

53:05.046 --> 53:07.348
I don't believe,
under the condition you were in...

53:07.448 --> 53:09.416
that you were responsible
for your actions.

53:11.218 --> 53:14.522
Then why was I carrying a gun?
I had no right to carry a gun.

53:14.622 --> 53:16.453
If you hadn't been, you might be dead.

53:16.957 --> 53:18.592
And he might still be alive.

53:18.692 --> 53:20.159
I underst...

53:21.228 --> 53:22.695
Can I think about this, please?

53:23.330 --> 53:24.297
No.

53:25.332 --> 53:27.061
I've made up my mind.

53:31.305 --> 53:32.294
Joe...

53:40.614 --> 53:41.816
No, I didn't know him.

53:41.916 --> 53:45.374
- I used to see him in the neighborhood.
- Where were you standing?

53:46.687 --> 53:48.120
What if she takes off?

53:49.223 --> 53:52.192
Then we got no goddamn witness
puts him at the scene.

53:52.359 --> 53:55.563
Yeah, but what if she testifies
and nobody fuckin' believes her?

53:55.663 --> 53:57.255
Perjury, maybe.

53:57.531 --> 53:58.964
That's a 50-50.

53:59.533 --> 54:00.901
They might believe her.

54:01.001 --> 54:03.371
She's a fucking stripper,
for Christ's sake.

54:03.471 --> 54:07.305
- Nobody's gonna believe her.
- Look, she's got... What the fuck?

54:07.708 --> 54:09.777
I don't believe her
when she tells the truth.

54:09.877 --> 54:10.845
What?

54:10.945 --> 54:12.346
- We got two bodies out here.
- So?

54:12.446 --> 54:14.048
- Three more in the house.
- So?

54:14.148 --> 54:17.351
I just wondered
if you're gonna be the primary on this.

54:17.451 --> 54:20.215
Yeah, we're coming.
Just give us some room.

54:20.955 --> 54:22.183
Come on!

54:23.157 --> 54:26.127
Look, Frank,
she could blow this whole thing.

54:26.227 --> 54:28.787
She could tie us in.
That would be it, we'd be fucked.

54:29.196 --> 54:30.595
All right.

54:30.998 --> 54:34.661
If it looks like she's gonna crumble,
we'll take steps.

54:35.002 --> 54:36.060
What steps?

54:36.637 --> 54:37.604
Steps.

54:38.005 --> 54:40.441
One more chalk outline in the city,
more or less.

54:40.541 --> 54:42.343
- Who's gonna notice?
- Shit, Frank.

54:42.443 --> 54:44.741
Come on, man. You think I like this?

54:44.845 --> 54:47.313
You know, you just can't go around
killing everybody.

54:48.015 --> 54:49.710
Wait just a second.

54:50.751 --> 54:53.276
Look around. What do we got?

54:53.420 --> 54:56.824
We got two stiffs on the pavement,
shot to shit, three more inside.

54:56.924 --> 54:59.393
That's five chalk outlines in one day...

54:59.493 --> 55:01.962
in one deal, in one neighborhood,
in one city.

55:02.062 --> 55:05.361
Just let me fill you in
on some fuckin' statistics here, okay?

55:05.466 --> 55:07.457
We're not killing everybody!

55:12.273 --> 55:15.174
Look, it's strictly
last resort, all right?

55:16.944 --> 55:18.145
Let's not kid ourselves.

55:18.245 --> 55:20.114
Push comes to shove,
somebody's going down.

55:20.214 --> 55:23.206
If you got another candidate,
I'm willing to listen.

55:27.354 --> 55:30.221
Come on. Let's do some work.

55:32.026 --> 55:34.462
- What?
- There's a body here.

55:34.562 --> 55:35.859
He's dead.

55:36.163 --> 55:38.688
- There's the other one.
- He's dead, too.

55:45.606 --> 55:48.075
In the last few weeks,
we've gotten hundreds...

55:48.175 --> 55:50.541
and hundreds of phone calls
and paper and mall...

55:50.945 --> 55:53.209
- Hello?
- Cynthia Webb?

55:53.747 --> 55:56.443
This is Richard Stein
with the District Attorney's office.

55:56.717 --> 56:00.121
...from women who say that their husbands
control, manipulate...

56:00.221 --> 56:04.487
threaten, and terrorize them.
And this is 1996, right?

56:05.626 --> 56:06.615
Miss Webb?

56:07.328 --> 56:08.317
Yeah.

56:08.729 --> 56:10.458
Any chance we could get together today?

56:10.864 --> 56:13.298
I'm really busy today.

56:13.601 --> 56:16.968
It won't take long.
You gonna be home around 2:00?

56:20.007 --> 56:23.033
Yeah. 2:00 is fine.

56:55.376 --> 56:57.276
Mr. McCall is on the terrace.

57:06.487 --> 57:08.148
Mr. Baylor is here.

57:10.591 --> 57:12.326
- Arthur.
- Nathan, how are you?

57:12.426 --> 57:15.396
Good, Arthur. Thanks.
Would you like some coffee?

57:15.496 --> 57:16.986
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

57:17.097 --> 57:18.291
Thank you.

57:20.668 --> 57:23.262
This is all a bit of a mystery.

57:23.871 --> 57:26.473
You certainly got my attention
with your phone call.

57:26.573 --> 57:28.063
What's this all about?

57:33.480 --> 57:35.311
Is there something here
you want me to see?

57:43.691 --> 57:44.749
My God.

57:59.206 --> 58:00.434
Cynthia?

58:10.417 --> 58:11.509
Shit!

58:14.288 --> 58:15.585
God damn it.

58:21.428 --> 58:23.419
- Divinci?
- Yeah.

58:23.530 --> 58:26.834
- Richard Stein, DA's office.
- Stein! Sure, sure, DA's office, yeah.

58:26.934 --> 58:28.736
Sorry about that. I didn't expect this.

58:28.836 --> 58:31.739
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk with Cynthia Webb.

58:31.839 --> 58:33.431
She's a witness in...

58:33.574 --> 58:34.475
Wait.

58:34.575 --> 58:38.078
- Aren't you and Rodriguez on this one?
- Yeah, yeah, we're on this case.

58:38.178 --> 58:41.615
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Got to go over the details, you know?

58:41.715 --> 58:43.617
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah.

58:43.717 --> 58:45.480
- Is she in?
- No.

58:46.186 --> 58:49.690
- Don't know where the hell she is.
- I was supposed to meet her at 2:00.

58:49.790 --> 58:52.418
- Do you know her?
- What do you mean?

58:52.826 --> 58:54.817
I just mean...

58:55.763 --> 58:59.358
- What?
- She's not in, and you were inside.

58:59.500 --> 59:03.061
The legal scenario.
She's a witness in a murder case, all right?

59:03.170 --> 59:05.832
You know, they don't answer a knock,
and the door's open...

59:06.006 --> 59:07.940
it's been my experience...

59:08.108 --> 59:11.407
You know, I wanted to make sure
there were no bodies lying around.

59:11.545 --> 59:12.534
Sure.

59:12.679 --> 59:16.080
- Don't tell on me.
- No, no, of course not.

59:16.183 --> 59:17.651
Great, man. Good to see you.

59:17.751 --> 59:21.915
Think I'll wait.
She might be stuck in traffic or something.

59:22.556 --> 59:25.259
If she does show up,
you let me know, all right?

59:25.359 --> 59:27.194
- Because I need to talk to her.
- Of course.

59:27.294 --> 59:29.091
All right. I'll see you in court.

59:29.229 --> 59:31.356
- Right.
- All right.

59:37.070 --> 59:38.799
Yeah, it's open.

59:44.378 --> 59:46.608
- Elliot Goff?
- Yeah?

59:47.781 --> 59:49.840
- Arthur Baylor?
- Yes.

59:52.619 --> 59:55.850
Sorry. God, Arthur Baylor. Hello.

59:56.056 --> 01:00:00.823
- Would you like... You're here to see me?
- Yes.

01:00:12.539 --> 01:00:13.767
William.

01:00:29.623 --> 01:00:30.954
Yes.

01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:37.153
I waited till 3:00,
but she never showed.

01:00:38.298 --> 01:00:40.994
So what are you telling me?
That she missed the appointment?

01:00:41.101 --> 01:00:42.625
Forgot you were coming? What?

01:00:42.736 --> 01:00:45.330
My guess? She split.

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:48.166
She split? Our witness split?

01:00:49.142 --> 01:00:53.147
Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses
from disappearing around here?

01:00:53.247 --> 01:00:56.216
I mean, what do I have to do,
lock them in the trunk of my car?

01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:58.218
What the fuck is going on?

01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:01.355
I want that bitch back here
and on the stand or in jail!

01:01:01.455 --> 01:01:03.252
I'll find her. All right?

01:01:03.557 --> 01:01:06.720
- I'll find her.
- Great. Thanks.

01:01:20.674 --> 01:01:21.936
Yeah.

01:01:22.342 --> 01:01:24.572
So why do you think he'd go there?

01:01:26.346 --> 01:01:28.449
- We need to talk.
- Just a second.

01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:30.517
Not just a second. Now!

01:01:31.184 --> 01:01:33.887
What do you want, Divinci?
Look, I got a witness took off.

01:01:33.987 --> 01:01:36.785
I gotta get her back.
I ain't got no time.

01:01:37.324 --> 01:01:39.493
You're the police.
What you coming to me for?

01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:44.326
Don't ask me the fucking questions here.
Your job is to find her.

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:49.097
- Where have I seen her before?
- She dances.

01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:51.462
Yeah, right.

01:01:52.105 --> 01:01:53.307
So why'd she leave?

01:01:53.407 --> 01:01:55.042
What the fuck is with the questions?

01:01:55.142 --> 01:01:58.645
Look, I heard what the fuck you said.
Now, you want me to find her?

01:01:58.745 --> 01:02:02.704
You need to tell me why the fuck she left,
so I know where not to look, all right?

01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:11.525
All right, she's supposed to testify.
She got scared.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.559
She thinks somebody
might try to kill her.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.496
That's why I want you to find her.

01:02:15.596 --> 01:02:20.124
Because if someone's trying to pop her,
I don't want anyone knowing where she is.

01:02:21.501 --> 01:02:22.836
So how long I got?

01:02:22.936 --> 01:02:25.138
- You got two days.
- Two fucking days, man?

01:02:25.238 --> 01:02:27.138
Just find her, pus-head.

01:02:28.942 --> 01:02:30.534
Sure, Detective.

01:02:31.845 --> 01:02:35.178
I always like to help out the fucking police
whenever possible.

01:02:50.364 --> 01:02:52.457
Isn't that Arthur Baylor?

01:02:58.405 --> 01:03:00.236
What the hell is he doing here?

01:03:00.607 --> 01:03:02.541
Hear ye, hear ye, all rise.

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:06.577
Face the flag and recognize
the principles for which it stands.

01:03:07.447 --> 01:03:10.382
Criminal Court, Department G,
is now in session.

01:03:10.684 --> 01:03:13.278
The Honorable Howard W. Pine presiding.

01:03:13.553 --> 01:03:16.044
Please be seated and come to order.

01:03:18.158 --> 01:03:19.860
The People v. Joe Doe...

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.795
in case number C9524705.

01:03:25.365 --> 01:03:26.354
Before we proceed...

01:03:26.466 --> 01:03:30.237
I must ask the defense if there's anything
this court should be made aware of.

01:03:30.337 --> 01:03:33.273
Yes, Your Honor.
I have joined the defense...

01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:35.809
in the representation
of Mr. William Daine McCall...

01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:38.503
otherwise known
to this court as Joe Doe.

01:03:38.879 --> 01:03:41.248
I represented the McCall family
for several years...

01:03:41.348 --> 01:03:44.112
before Mr. McCall
disappeared seven years ago.

01:03:44.317 --> 01:03:45.686
It was assumed that he had died...

01:03:45.786 --> 01:03:49.423
but since he has reappeared
under these tragic circumstances...

01:03:49.523 --> 01:03:53.926
I would ask the court for a continuance
to allow the defense to prepare...

01:03:54.094 --> 01:03:56.585
in the light of his real identity
now being known.

01:03:57.864 --> 01:04:00.733
- How long do you need?
- One week should be sufficient.

01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:04.470
Any objection
to a week's continuance by the state?

01:04:05.105 --> 01:04:06.672
I don't...

01:04:07.574 --> 01:04:09.007
believe so, your Honor.

01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:11.338
Then I grant a one-week's continuance.

01:04:11.645 --> 01:04:14.443
We'll start the proceedings
next Monday morning.

01:04:18.518 --> 01:04:20.420
...when it was discovered
the man who confessed...

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.389
to killing an undercover DEA agent...

01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:25.253
was actually himself
thought dead for seven years.

01:04:25.392 --> 01:04:27.327
The man who signed
the confession as Joe Doe...

01:04:27.427 --> 01:04:31.193
Is actually William Daine McCall,
brother of Nathan McCall.

01:04:31.298 --> 01:04:33.823
Both are sons of the founder
of McCall International...

01:04:33.934 --> 01:04:36.336
a corporation involved
In telecommunications...

01:04:36.436 --> 01:04:39.872
computer design and development
and other related industries.

01:04:39.973 --> 01:04:43.170
The net worth
of both men is estimated at over $1 billion.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.779
"William McCall shunned
the business world...

01:04:45.879 --> 01:04:47.648
"and turned his life to medicine...

01:04:47.748 --> 01:04:51.309
"receiving his medical degree
from Harvard in 1969.

01:04:51.718 --> 01:04:54.221
"Once again, he turned his back
on the established norm...

01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:56.653
"and spent several years in Africa...

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.788
"performing organ transplants
for the poor."

01:05:00.494 --> 01:05:03.725
This is who you picked?
This is who you fucking picked?

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:07.061
You picked a surgeon who performs
transplants on the poor in Africa?

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.635
He was living on the fucking streets!

01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:12.639
How was I supposed to know
he's a goddamn doctor?

01:05:12.739 --> 01:05:17.676
He's not a fucking doctor.
You picked a saint to pin a murder on!

01:05:19.045 --> 01:05:20.103
God!

01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:23.476
When we pick them, we sure do pick them.

01:05:23.717 --> 01:05:26.151
Why didn't you get the Pope
and pin it on him?

01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:29.389
Here: "Disappeared seven years ago
on September 19th...

01:05:29.489 --> 01:05:33.427
"two weeks after the tragic
death of his wife and two young children...

01:05:33.527 --> 01:05:35.757
"in a multiple-vehicle accident.

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:40.500
"At the same time, it was assumed that he
had returned to Africa...

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.402
"but that was never confirmed.

01:05:42.502 --> 01:05:44.671
"What Mr. McCall
has been doing for seven years...

01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:48.673
"is now the mystery
that the court will try to help unravel."

01:05:51.211 --> 01:05:52.303
Shit.

01:05:56.783 --> 01:06:00.048
- Let's just think about it for a second.
- Yeah, let's.

01:06:02.355 --> 01:06:04.516
What's the worst-case scenario?

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:07.928
What, are you joking me?

01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:09.859
- No.
- Are you playing?

01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:12.955
What's worse than what we've done
that could still happen?

01:06:13.066 --> 01:06:15.969
Or what's worse if this doesn't work out,
blows up in our face...

01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:20.373
we go to jail, sent to the electric chair,
then we die, then we go to fucking hell?

01:06:20.473 --> 01:06:22.100
Worse than that?

01:06:24.077 --> 01:06:25.942
Will you work with me here?

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.816
Excuse me, I'm having a bad morning.
Maybe you could excuse me.

01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:31.315
Would you repeat the question?

01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:33.709
All right, Doc walks.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.215
There's nothing to connect us
to the evidence.

01:06:39.893 --> 01:06:41.861
There's one person
who can connect us to him.

01:06:48.301 --> 01:06:50.292
I don't even want
to argue about it anymore.

01:06:50.637 --> 01:06:52.264
Let's just fucking kill her.

01:06:54.441 --> 01:06:55.601
Frank?

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:04.817
All right, let's do it.

01:07:07.454 --> 01:07:09.217
We need to talk.

01:07:11.057 --> 01:07:14.761
- Man, are you fucking with me?
- I'm not fucking with you.

01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:18.422
- Are you fucking with me?
- Hold on. You don't know?

01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:22.256
- Know what?
- This isn't good.

01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:24.633
- What?
- You're a cop, and you don't even know.

01:07:24.838 --> 01:07:26.635
Come on, knock it off. What?

01:07:27.274 --> 01:07:28.441
The cops got her.

01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:32.204
Ain't that a bitch? You a cop,
and you got to come to me to find out?

01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:34.881
This is a crazy fucking world
we're living in, man.

01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:36.917
What fucking cops? What cops?

01:07:37.017 --> 01:07:38.685
I don't know what cops!

01:07:38.785 --> 01:07:41.154
All I know is my people
went to her sister's house...

01:07:41.254 --> 01:07:43.484
and she had already left.

01:07:43.657 --> 01:07:46.854
Her sister said cops took her.
I figured it was you.

01:07:49.162 --> 01:07:50.220
Fuck!

01:07:50.997 --> 01:07:52.055
Fuck!

01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:55.434
- Shit.
- What an asshole!

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.294
You're a good judge of character.

01:07:58.538 --> 01:08:00.707
Look, she's our goddamn witness...

01:08:00.807 --> 01:08:04.334
and if she's in custody,
somebody better fucking tell me!

01:08:05.178 --> 01:08:07.510
Try to get at me as soon as you can.
All right.

01:08:09.316 --> 01:08:11.384
Anything? Nothing.

01:08:11.484 --> 01:08:13.418
Nobody knows nothing.

01:08:13.753 --> 01:08:17.689
DA doesn't know anything.
The DEA doesn't know shit from shinola.

01:08:18.024 --> 01:08:20.794
If she's being held by the police,
we'd know.

01:08:20.894 --> 01:08:22.062
Unless she said something.

01:08:22.162 --> 01:08:25.131
No, she didn't say anything,
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:26.858
It was that piece of shit.

01:08:27.334 --> 01:08:29.029
What, Manny?

01:08:41.113 --> 01:08:43.104
Don't ever lie to me again.

01:08:44.184 --> 01:08:45.276
Okay?

01:08:56.895 --> 01:08:58.796
It's time to go.

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:09.200
Hear ye, hear ye, all rise.

01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:13.108
Face the flag and recognize
the principles for which it stands.

01:09:13.345 --> 01:09:16.542
The Criminal Court, Department G,
is now in session.

01:09:16.916 --> 01:09:19.942
The Honorable Howard W. Pine
Is presiding.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.455
Please be seated and come to order.

01:09:22.555 --> 01:09:24.323
The People v. William McCall...

01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:28.792
In case number 9524705.

01:09:29.895 --> 01:09:33.354
...when he pulled this gun
and fired at agent Hudd...

01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:35.899
killing him instantly.

01:09:36.102 --> 01:09:39.071
Let the record show that this is
the weapon used in the crime:

01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:42.073
A Smith & Wesson.44-caliber handgun.

01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:47.580
All these.44s
are starting to look the same to me.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.850
So when you arrested the defendant,
did he deny having killed Agent Hudd?

01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:52.939
No.

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:57.220
Can you describe the defendant's
condition at the time of his arrest?

01:09:57.657 --> 01:09:58.715
Yes.

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:00.460
He was drunk.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.929
We could smell the booze on him,
but we drew blood, and he did not object.

01:10:05.098 --> 01:10:06.725
We have the blood test report showing...

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:09.427
that he had four times
the legal limit to drive.

01:10:10.136 --> 01:10:14.174
But you knew that this was the man
that you were looking for?

01:10:14.274 --> 01:10:16.435
- Yes, sir.
- Based on what?

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:18.900
Based on his description.

01:10:19.312 --> 01:10:21.644
And who provided you
with that description?

01:10:23.817 --> 01:10:25.444
A Miss Cynthia...

01:10:26.186 --> 01:10:27.220
something.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.345
I don't know. I'm not sure.

01:10:29.956 --> 01:10:32.390
I believe her name is Cynthia Webb.

01:10:33.426 --> 01:10:35.087
Cynthia Webb.

01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:40.394
At least...

01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:44.203
based on the statement filed
the night she picked him out of the lineup.

01:10:44.571 --> 01:10:46.596
Now, is that name familiar to you?

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.769
Yes, that's her.

01:10:49.943 --> 01:10:52.275
And where did you find Miss Webb?

01:10:52.745 --> 01:10:55.475
On the same street. Same area.

01:10:56.416 --> 01:11:00.120
And she agreed
to pick the defendant out of the lineup?

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.221
Yes.

01:11:01.321 --> 01:11:03.123
Were you aware that
Miss Webb disappeared...

01:11:03.223 --> 01:11:05.521
after she was served with a subpoena?

01:11:06.693 --> 01:11:10.527
Yes. My partner and I...

01:11:11.164 --> 01:11:13.894
tried to contact her about the case...

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.133
but we were unsuccessful
in our attempts.

01:11:18.805 --> 01:11:21.535
Thank you, Detective.
That's all the questions I have.

01:11:22.675 --> 01:11:26.304
I'm gonna tell you right now,
you did a great job.

01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.539
Don't come down on yourself.

01:11:29.983 --> 01:11:31.075
Here.

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:33.983
To justice in all its forms.

01:11:37.624 --> 01:11:39.592
We're not out of the woods yet, buddy.

01:11:39.692 --> 01:11:42.862
Without Miss Webb,
there's no place they can go.

01:11:42.962 --> 01:11:45.453
We still got the confession,
the gun, the ballistics...

01:11:45.565 --> 01:11:48.056
and I don't care
about all this African doctor crap.

01:11:48.168 --> 01:11:50.261
The man is a fucking drunk.

01:11:50.403 --> 01:11:53.372
He's been a fucking drunk
for seven goddamn years.

01:11:54.741 --> 01:11:57.073
Let's have a drink for drunks.

01:11:59.212 --> 01:12:00.543
To drunks.

01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:07.983
I just wish I knew
where the fuck she was.

01:12:08.588 --> 01:12:09.680
So...

01:12:10.256 --> 01:12:12.747
I think we'll have
to rely on his confession...

01:12:12.992 --> 01:12:16.696
for a description of what happened,
because he's never gonna take the stand.

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:18.195
DA's office.

01:12:19.399 --> 01:12:20.423
What?

01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:23.068
When?

01:12:23.703 --> 01:12:24.897
Where...

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:32.244
- They found Cynthia Webb.
- What? Where?

01:12:33.513 --> 01:12:35.276
- I don't know.
- When?

01:12:35.381 --> 01:12:37.517
- I don't know.
- Who the hell was that?

01:12:37.617 --> 01:12:40.609
I don't know, I don't know.
They hung up.

01:12:43.122 --> 01:12:45.716
What the hell is going on around here?

01:12:48.461 --> 01:12:49.758
I don't know.

01:12:51.864 --> 01:12:55.891
You don't need to say nothing,
but are you really a doctor?

01:12:57.904 --> 01:12:59.064
I was.

01:13:00.106 --> 01:13:02.768
- A surgeon.
- No shit!

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:05.101
No shit! Really?

01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:07.245
A surgeon?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.010
I know I'm nobody to judge,
but you must've been a smart guy.

01:13:12.986 --> 01:13:15.477
What the hell are you doing in here?

01:13:20.226 --> 01:13:22.717
I had an affair with another woman.

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:26.657
A nurse at the hospital
that I worked at.

01:13:28.668 --> 01:13:30.397
It was...

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.501
something.

01:13:33.873 --> 01:13:37.809
I don't remember much about her,
except that my wife found out about it.

01:13:40.947 --> 01:13:42.471
We had a fight.

01:13:44.517 --> 01:13:47.111
She left the house, she took the kids.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.049
She was hysterical.

01:13:53.293 --> 01:13:55.386
I should've done something...

01:13:56.763 --> 01:13:58.924
gone after them, I don't know.

01:14:07.307 --> 01:14:11.505
They died in a car accident
about a mile from the house.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.851
I never told anybody that.

01:14:39.439 --> 01:14:43.376
Your Honor, the people would like to call
Miss Cynthia Webb to the stand.

01:14:43.476 --> 01:14:45.910
The court calls Cynthia Webb.

01:15:01.828 --> 01:15:03.229
Raise your right hand.

01:15:03.329 --> 01:15:05.559
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

01:15:05.665 --> 01:15:07.792
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.959
- Sure.
- I know her.

01:15:10.069 --> 01:15:13.640
- She's the woman who identified you.
- No, no, I mean, I know her.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.808
- How?
- I don't know.

01:15:15.908 --> 01:15:17.410
I think I lived near her.

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:19.846
Could you please state your name
for the court?

01:15:19.946 --> 01:15:20.813
Cynthia Webb.

01:15:20.913 --> 01:15:24.212
Do you recognize the man
that you identified in a police lineup?

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.615
- Yes.
- Is he anywhere in this courtroom?

01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:29.612
Yes.

01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:32.788
Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?

01:15:34.227 --> 01:15:35.285
Yes.

01:15:37.163 --> 01:15:41.657
Could you please describe for us
what you saw on the night of June 14?

01:15:44.637 --> 01:15:47.572
I was coming out of this
all-night mini-mart.

01:16:07.527 --> 01:16:09.062
How sure are you...

01:16:09.162 --> 01:16:12.097
that the man you saw with the gun
is the defendant?

01:16:13.933 --> 01:16:15.161
I'm sure.

01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:17.900
Thank you.

01:16:18.104 --> 01:16:19.901
No further questions.

01:16:20.339 --> 01:16:21.704
Miss Webb...

01:16:22.809 --> 01:16:24.674
Is it "Miss"?

01:16:25.178 --> 01:16:26.202
Yes.

01:16:26.779 --> 01:16:28.014
Miss Webb...

01:16:28.114 --> 01:16:31.641
had you ever seen the defendant
before that night you just described?

01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:33.008
No.

01:16:37.356 --> 01:16:39.153
Do you know what perjury is?

01:16:39.826 --> 01:16:44.197
- When you lie.
- When you lie under oath in a court of law.

01:16:44.297 --> 01:16:46.128
Do you know
what the penalty for that is?

01:16:46.232 --> 01:16:48.601
- You go to jail.
- Yes.

01:16:48.701 --> 01:16:49.895
Cynthia...

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.872
did you ever see
the defendant before that night?

01:16:52.972 --> 01:16:55.875
Objection. The witness
answered that question, Your Honor.

01:16:55.975 --> 01:16:56.964
Sustained.

01:16:57.143 --> 01:17:00.980
I'm just trying to give the witness
the opportunity to remember...

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.514
if she ever saw Mr. McCall...

01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:06.311
any other time before
the night in question.

01:17:06.886 --> 01:17:09.878
Miss Webb, do you
understand the consequences of perjury?

01:17:10.289 --> 01:17:13.520
- Yes.
- Let's get on with it then.

01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:17.993
What did you buy
when you went into the mini-mart?

01:17:18.998 --> 01:17:22.301
- What did I buy?
- You remembered seeing Mr. McCall.

01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:24.528
You remembered a gunshot
and the car crash.

01:17:24.637 --> 01:17:27.800
I just wondered if you remembered
what you bought in the mini-mart.

01:17:34.714 --> 01:17:37.512
- Shampoo, I think.
- That's all?

01:17:37.717 --> 01:17:39.912
- Yeah.
- Where do you live?

01:17:40.253 --> 01:17:43.656
435617th street, No. 4.

01:17:43.756 --> 01:17:45.553
Is that close to this mini-mart?

01:17:46.058 --> 01:17:47.860
Close? Sort of.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.120
How far would you say?

01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:51.828
- I don't really know.
- Is it walking distance?

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:54.693
- Not really.
- Did you walk there that night or drive?

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:57.437
- I drove.
- You drove?

01:17:57.537 --> 01:18:01.073
But when you left the mini-mart,
you said you walked along the street.

01:18:01.173 --> 01:18:03.509
- Yes.
- How far?

01:18:03.609 --> 01:18:05.678
- To the corner.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:18:05.778 --> 01:18:08.269
I don't see the point
to this line of reasoning.

01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:11.484
- Is there a point?
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:18:11.584 --> 01:18:13.415
Since this is the only witness...

01:18:13.853 --> 01:18:16.856
I'm just trying to establish
what the scene was like that night.

01:18:16.956 --> 01:18:20.448
- Try to get there as quickly as possible.
- Thank you, sir.

01:18:20.927 --> 01:18:23.760
How far from the corner
was this mini-mart?

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:25.998
I mean, was it in the middle
of the block?

01:18:26.332 --> 01:18:27.594
Close to the corner?

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.338
- In the middle, I think.
- So you walked all the way to the corner?

01:18:32.438 --> 01:18:35.708
- I assume you were going back to your car?
- Yes.

01:18:35.808 --> 01:18:37.708
Any reason you parked so far away?

01:18:38.477 --> 01:18:40.843
There were a lot of cars
on the street that night.

01:18:40.947 --> 01:18:42.778
Any other people on the street?

01:18:43.783 --> 01:18:44.807
No.

01:18:45.217 --> 01:18:46.946
Lots of cars, no people.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.552
Any traffic?

01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:51.085
I don't really remember.

01:18:51.257 --> 01:18:54.920
So you were the only person
who saw Joe on the street that night?

01:18:56.562 --> 01:18:57.995
I didn't see anybody else.

01:18:58.297 --> 01:18:59.764
So you heard a gunshot.

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:01.534
You heard a car crash.

01:19:01.634 --> 01:19:04.504
You saw Joe running past
with a gun in his hand.

01:19:04.604 --> 01:19:07.505
What did you do then?
Call the police, 911?

01:19:08.574 --> 01:19:09.506
I went home.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:11.866
You went home? Straight home?

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:13.371
Yes.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.673
So you're sure it was Joe
you saw that night?

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.521
- Yes.
- When you went home?

01:19:23.589 --> 01:19:24.778
Yes.

01:19:24.991 --> 01:19:27.482
When you went home, you saw Joe?

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:33.021
- No.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:19:33.132 --> 01:19:35.501
The defense
is trying to confuse the witness.

01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:39.628
I'm not trying to confuse the witness.
The witness is trying to confuse this court.

01:19:39.739 --> 01:19:42.074
And I have witnesses
who will refute her testimony...

01:19:42.174 --> 01:19:44.443
who were on the corner
the night of the shooting...

01:19:44.543 --> 01:19:47.079
who never saw Miss Webb,
who never heard a gunshot...

01:19:47.179 --> 01:19:48.514
who never saw Joe running past.

01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:51.751
Now, Miss Webb saw Joe
outside of her building that night...

01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:54.615
because he lives in the alley next door.
Isn't that true?

01:19:55.187 --> 01:19:58.991
- Objection!
- When I referred to the defendant as Joe...

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:01.761
you knew exactly who I was
talking about, didn't you?

01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:05.925
Now, this trial is The People
v. William McCall... not "Joe."

01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:08.792
The name Joe has never been
mentioned in this trial...

01:20:08.901 --> 01:20:11.131
so how did you know
who I was talking about?

01:20:11.971 --> 01:20:12.903
Miss Webb?

01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:16.406
How do you know the defendant as Joe?

01:20:26.419 --> 01:20:29.411
He lived in the alley
next to my apartment building.

01:20:34.093 --> 01:20:35.958
Shit.

01:20:43.569 --> 01:20:46.094
Why did you lie to this court?

01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:48.262
I don't know.

01:20:49.775 --> 01:20:51.834
Are you afraid of somebody?

01:20:53.612 --> 01:20:57.708
- I don't know.
- Are you trying to protect somebody?

01:20:58.918 --> 01:21:01.011
I don't know.

01:21:01.887 --> 01:21:06.324
Answer the questions, Miss Webb,
or I'll be forced to cite you for contempt.

01:21:24.577 --> 01:21:27.213
- She didn't talk.
- Don't hold your breath.

01:21:27.313 --> 01:21:30.549
- Do you think she's gonna talk?
- I know she's gonna talk.

01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:32.351
We can make it look gang related.

01:21:32.451 --> 01:21:34.749
The problem is,
we're gonna need another gun.

01:21:34.854 --> 01:21:38.090
The problem is, she's in fucking jail.
That's the goddamn problem.

01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:39.191
Yeah.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:42.783
Since when is being in jail
ever a guarantee of a long life?

01:21:43.929 --> 01:21:45.191
Just get another gun.

01:21:53.139 --> 01:21:55.341
Wake up, Manny. Get up.

01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:58.477
- I didn't do anything.
- Everything's fine, everything's fine.

01:21:58.577 --> 01:22:02.206
I just came to apologize,
but I need a little privacy here.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.050
Come on, come on, come on. Move!

01:22:07.753 --> 01:22:09.188
I need a favor.

01:22:09.288 --> 01:22:11.190
I need you to bail somebody out of jail.

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:12.951
Bail's $25,000.

01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:16.629
- You gotta be kidding.
- Now, look, I want her out tonight.

01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:19.095
I do not want you to tell her who.

01:22:19.665 --> 01:22:22.501
- It's a surprise.
- So how am I supposed to pay for this?

01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:25.434
You know, they don't take
American Express.

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:31.638
I know you know how to get rid of this.

01:22:32.211 --> 01:22:34.611
There's a lot more than $25,000 here.

01:22:35.014 --> 01:22:38.381
You keep the change.
But I want her out in two hours.

01:22:39.018 --> 01:22:42.545
Otherwise, I'll come back
and nail you for possession.

01:22:46.025 --> 01:22:47.822
How'd you get to be such a prick?

01:22:48.527 --> 01:22:49.516
DNA.

01:22:51.297 --> 01:22:53.288
Asshole. I got your DNA.

01:23:25.464 --> 01:23:27.125
Did you get the gun?

01:23:27.867 --> 01:23:29.391
Yeah, I got it.

01:23:31.003 --> 01:23:33.972
What's with you? You all right?
Everything okay?

01:23:34.974 --> 01:23:36.942
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

01:23:37.042 --> 01:23:39.211
- What? What?
- We're going to kill a witness...

01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:41.981
who's in jail because
we killed a fucking DEA agent.

01:23:42.081 --> 01:23:44.606
This kind of shit troubles me.
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:23:45.851 --> 01:23:48.843
Take off the fucking dress
and get back in the game, will you?

01:23:50.256 --> 01:23:52.349
Shake it off. Come on.

01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:56.249
We got to do what we got to do.
That's it.

01:23:57.329 --> 01:23:58.387
Yeah.

01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:01.733
I know. We got to do what we got to do.

01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:03.301
That's right.

01:24:04.036 --> 01:24:05.503
Let's just get it over with.

01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:10.209
I don't understand.
Why can't you tell me who bailed me out?

01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:13.005
The man comes to me
and tells me to bail you out.

01:24:13.412 --> 01:24:15.981
He gives me cash, I do it.
It's what I do for a living.

01:24:16.081 --> 01:24:19.107
I bail people out of jail, all right?
You stay with me.

01:24:19.518 --> 01:24:21.008
Was he a cop?

01:24:21.487 --> 01:24:23.322
Right. Cops bail
people out all the time.

01:24:23.422 --> 01:24:26.192
Ain't there some kind of dichotomy
in that shit for you?

01:24:26.292 --> 01:24:27.426
I don't like this.

01:24:27.526 --> 01:24:30.930
Look, you can either stay here in jail,
or you can come with me.

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:35.399
- Shit, the choice is yours.
- Just tell me, what did he look like?

01:24:39.171 --> 01:24:41.139
You are a stripper, right?

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.477
Guys fall in love with your type
all the time...

01:24:45.577 --> 01:24:48.171
but they don't know how to get close.
You know?

01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:53.545
Baby, somebody wants you
to owe them something.

01:24:54.553 --> 01:24:56.544
You take that shit or leave it.

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.786
Fuck!

01:25:25.017 --> 01:25:27.076
This is the last time, Frank.

01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:29.655
The last time we kill somebody.

01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:32.087
Yeah. It's the last time.

01:25:32.858 --> 01:25:34.485
I mean...

01:25:35.594 --> 01:25:37.084
eleven is enough.

01:25:37.696 --> 01:25:39.755
Eleven dead bodies is enough.

01:25:40.699 --> 01:25:42.030
I get the picture.

01:25:42.634 --> 01:25:43.999
Damn, man.

01:25:47.239 --> 01:25:49.366
Why'd you have to go and kill Hudd?

01:25:54.113 --> 01:25:55.774
What's going on here?

01:25:58.884 --> 01:26:01.453
What's the matter?
You mad at me or something?

01:26:01.553 --> 01:26:04.249
Why did we have to start
killing people, man?

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:07.760
None of this shit would have
never happened if you...

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.487
hadn't started killing people.

01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:13.025
Look, drug dealers
don't qualify as people.

01:26:13.365 --> 01:26:14.832
Never did, never will.

01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.269
Now, what the hell's wrong with you?

01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:23.332
What's the matter? You're worried about
where the money went, is that it?

01:26:24.743 --> 01:26:26.472
I'm just sick of it.

01:26:26.912 --> 01:26:28.504
Sick of it all.

01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:30.375
That's all.

01:26:30.716 --> 01:26:32.183
I'm all right.

01:27:00.846 --> 01:27:02.780
I need some fresh air.

01:27:45.324 --> 01:27:47.019
What's going on, man?

01:27:50.129 --> 01:27:52.154
Just talk to me, all right?

01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:54.999
Just fucking talk to me.

01:27:55.267 --> 01:27:56.393
I don't know.

01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:10.041
Look...

01:28:11.016 --> 01:28:13.177
I owe some people some money...

01:28:13.585 --> 01:28:15.888
and I don't know how
I'm going to pay them back.

01:28:15.988 --> 01:28:17.580
I got problems.

01:28:18.023 --> 01:28:19.217
Gambling.

01:28:19.892 --> 01:28:20.984
Yeah.

01:28:21.493 --> 01:28:22.653
Yeah.

01:28:24.863 --> 01:28:26.353
You know, Frank...

01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:31.435
Why can't we just forget this shit?

01:28:32.504 --> 01:28:34.972
Why can't we just get
the fuck out of here?

01:28:36.175 --> 01:28:38.666
Maybe leave the country or something.

01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:47.274
- What are you doing?
- Take off your fucking shirt!

01:28:48.053 --> 01:28:50.146
What are you talking about?

01:28:51.089 --> 01:28:53.216
Just take off your shirt now.

01:28:53.759 --> 01:28:57.092
If there's nothing to worry about,
then I'll apologize.

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:59.589
But I'm not gonna argue.

01:28:59.932 --> 01:29:04.733
- Now take off your fucking shirt. Now!
- I can't believe this shit!

01:29:04.937 --> 01:29:07.405
After all we've been through,
you don't trust me?

01:29:07.506 --> 01:29:10.236
After all this shit you got me into,
you don't trust me?

01:29:10.842 --> 01:29:13.072
Take off your shirt.

01:29:16.848 --> 01:29:18.076
Or what?

01:29:20.652 --> 01:29:22.449
Or you'll shoot me?

01:29:22.854 --> 01:29:24.754
Is that what you'll do, Frank?

01:29:24.957 --> 01:29:27.187
Kill me? Me, too?

01:29:29.228 --> 01:29:30.661
Then shoot.

01:29:34.366 --> 01:29:37.858
I'll ask you one more motherfucking time.
Now take off the goddamn shirt.

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.096
Take it off!

01:29:50.649 --> 01:29:51.707
Fuck!

01:29:54.453 --> 01:29:57.320
I can't fucking believe you.
I can't believe you.

01:30:00.692 --> 01:30:02.387
Shit!

01:30:02.861 --> 01:30:04.488
I'm sorry, man.

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:06.457
You're right, man.

01:30:08.567 --> 01:30:11.365
I don't know what the fuck, man.
I'm just...

01:30:11.937 --> 01:30:14.371
I'm fucking nervous, man, like you.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.076
Come on, forget it, all right?

01:30:18.176 --> 01:30:21.513
It's this fucking thing,
I'm telling you, it's this fucking thing.

01:30:21.613 --> 01:30:23.877
I can't believe you did that.

01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:27.019
Really, man. Let's just do it.

01:30:27.119 --> 01:30:29.280
Let's just get it over with.

01:30:39.464 --> 01:30:40.761
I'm sorry, man.

01:30:43.035 --> 01:30:46.562
Look, I know I'm gonna feel
a whole lot better when she's dead.

01:30:46.672 --> 01:30:48.663
Then we're off the hook.

01:30:49.107 --> 01:30:50.335
Whatever.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:00.519
What the fuck are you doing?

01:31:00.619 --> 01:31:02.921
You fucking asshole!
You fucking asshole!

01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:05.489
You fucking rat! You fucking rat!

01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:08.560
- Yeah, I'm a fucking rat!
- Fucking A!

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.651
Yeah, I fucking ratted you out!

01:31:11.396 --> 01:31:13.261
Simms knows everything.

01:31:13.965 --> 01:31:16.024
Go ahead. I don't give a fuck.

01:31:16.134 --> 01:31:19.004
Go ahead, blow my brains out.
I deserve to fucking die.

01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:21.299
Fucking A right you do, man!

01:31:31.717 --> 01:31:33.446
Get out of the car.

01:31:35.987 --> 01:31:36.954
Frank.

01:31:38.757 --> 01:31:41.487
Get out of the car now.

01:31:53.739 --> 01:31:54.706
Frank.

01:31:57.409 --> 01:32:00.469
This is why you can never lose
your sense of humor.

01:33:19.224 --> 01:33:21.124
I hate my fucking life.

01:33:29.534 --> 01:33:30.558
Damn.

01:33:50.455 --> 01:33:51.717
God!

01:33:52.891 --> 01:33:55.121
I hate my fucking life!

01:33:55.327 --> 01:33:56.624
I hate it!

01:34:18.717 --> 01:34:21.117
Guess we caught you at a bad time.

01:34:28.693 --> 01:34:30.854
But we all have problems.

01:34:32.597 --> 01:34:34.690
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:34:42.574 --> 01:34:44.176
Divinci must've figured it out.

01:34:44.276 --> 01:34:46.745
I didn't think he'd kill
his own partner, though.

01:34:46.845 --> 01:34:48.335
He's an animal.

01:34:48.713 --> 01:34:50.248
The recorder's busted up...

01:34:50.348 --> 01:34:53.317
but we might be able
to salvage some of the tape.

01:34:54.019 --> 01:34:55.854
I want him, you understand me?

01:34:55.954 --> 01:34:59.287
I don't care what it takes.
I want that son of a bitch.

01:35:13.338 --> 01:35:14.430
Shit!

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.065
Who the fuck are you?

01:35:18.944 --> 01:35:20.377
Miss Webb...

01:35:20.812 --> 01:35:22.245
we'd like you to come with us.

01:35:33.091 --> 01:35:35.787
- Who set it up?
- I don't know.

01:35:35.894 --> 01:35:38.463
- It was Divinci, wasn't it?
- I don't know.

01:35:38.563 --> 01:35:41.123
Which one pulled the trigger,
Divinci or Rodriguez?

01:35:41.232 --> 01:35:43.535
- I don't know.
- Detective Rodriguez is dead.

01:35:43.635 --> 01:35:45.330
He was shot in the head last night.

01:35:45.804 --> 01:35:48.673
Rodriguez was wearing a recorder.
Divinci found it.

01:35:48.773 --> 01:35:52.436
- You can do addition, can't you?
- You are so full of shit.

01:35:55.747 --> 01:35:57.612
Just tell us what you know.

01:35:57.949 --> 01:36:00.747
- Look, where's Divinci?
- We don't know.

01:36:01.186 --> 01:36:05.056
- But we're gonna find him.
- You're gonna find him? Yeah, right.

01:36:05.156 --> 01:36:07.125
I don't know a fucking thing.

01:36:07.225 --> 01:36:08.988
- Listen!
- Back off!

01:36:10.328 --> 01:36:12.193
Hooper, get her out of here.

01:36:19.037 --> 01:36:21.369
Get a copy of the tape to Baylor.

01:36:21.706 --> 01:36:23.469
Make sure it doesn't come from us.

01:36:24.676 --> 01:36:26.007
Your attorney is here.

01:36:27.545 --> 01:36:29.103
What attorney?

01:36:34.252 --> 01:36:35.549
Hi, Cynthia.

01:36:35.887 --> 01:36:39.345
- Sit down, please.
- I got nothing to say.

01:36:39.557 --> 01:36:42.151
Yes. So I'm told.

01:36:43.294 --> 01:36:46.525
Forget it. Same shit.

01:36:47.132 --> 01:36:50.795
Let's just get it over with.
I'll feel a whole lot better when she's dead.

01:36:50.902 --> 01:36:52.767
Then we're off the hook.

01:36:53.605 --> 01:36:54.902
Right.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.033
Come here! You fucking rat!

01:36:58.677 --> 01:36:59.735
Yeah.

01:37:00.245 --> 01:37:02.907
Yeah, I am. I'm a fucking rat!

01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:05.709
I framed you, Frank.
I fucking framed you.

01:37:05.817 --> 01:37:07.546
Simms knows everything.

01:37:07.719 --> 01:37:09.619
- I fucking should die.
- Yeah...

01:37:10.455 --> 01:37:12.958
I think you know my client is innocent.

01:37:13.058 --> 01:37:15.492
That's all I care about, my client.

01:37:16.428 --> 01:37:18.896
But I understand why you're scared.

01:37:19.230 --> 01:37:22.688
You're already facing perjury charges,
and my guess is that...

01:37:22.801 --> 01:37:25.070
you're in this a lot deeper.

01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:28.864
But I'm not after you.
I get nothing if you go to jail.

01:37:29.174 --> 01:37:31.335
But I think that if I help you...

01:37:32.844 --> 01:37:34.272
you could help my client.

01:37:35.547 --> 01:37:37.981
- How?
- Sit down, please.

01:37:38.316 --> 01:37:40.079
William... Joe...

01:37:40.885 --> 01:37:42.546
didn't really do it, did he?

01:37:44.456 --> 01:37:45.480
No.

01:37:46.925 --> 01:37:47.892
No, he didn't.

01:37:48.026 --> 01:37:50.462
No goddamn way.
I'm won't grant that whore immunity.

01:37:50.562 --> 01:37:52.996
She lied on the stand.
She's protecting somebody.

01:37:53.098 --> 01:37:54.895
And she's involved.

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.760
- I want them all.
- All right.

01:37:57.869 --> 01:38:00.739
Before I leave,
I want to remind you of something.

01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:02.440
You have shit for a case.

01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:05.210
If you cared about seeing justice
for your dead comrade...

01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.678
you wouldn't blow this deal.

01:38:06.778 --> 01:38:10.548
Immunity for her testimony
is a small price for a bad cop.

01:38:10.648 --> 01:38:13.549
And that's the only way
she's gonna talk.

01:38:14.519 --> 01:38:18.285
And William McCall walks right now.
All charges dropped.

01:38:21.092 --> 01:38:25.392
If what she says is any good, I'll deal.
If it isn't, nobody goes anywhere.

01:38:44.916 --> 01:38:46.440
Cynthia, sit down, please.

01:38:56.828 --> 01:39:00.389
- How does it feel to be a free man again?
- Do you have any comments, sir?

01:39:00.598 --> 01:39:02.759
Sorry, no more questions.
No more questions.

01:39:02.867 --> 01:39:03.959
Thank you.

01:39:04.302 --> 01:39:05.564
Thank you!

01:39:58.022 --> 01:40:00.149
Guess you had no choice.

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.528
You had to do the right thing.

01:40:11.936 --> 01:40:13.699
Baby, look at you.

01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:18.268
What do you want?

01:40:19.344 --> 01:40:20.868
What do I want?

01:40:21.746 --> 01:40:23.873
You're asking me what I want?

01:40:24.916 --> 01:40:27.214
Are you gonna grant me three wishes?

01:40:28.586 --> 01:40:29.985
Let's see...

01:40:30.688 --> 01:40:32.747
I don't know what to ask for.

01:40:35.059 --> 01:40:36.959
Money would be nice.

01:40:43.368 --> 01:40:45.165
Love would be better.

01:40:47.605 --> 01:40:49.835
But a little fucking loyalty...

01:40:51.943 --> 01:40:54.468
you can never get enough of that.

01:41:01.586 --> 01:41:03.554
We'll start with money.

01:41:16.367 --> 01:41:18.130
That's all I've got.

01:41:20.271 --> 01:41:23.942
- They'll catch you.
- No. They don't got a clue, baby.

01:41:24.042 --> 01:41:27.102
You know why?
'Cause I'm following my heart...

01:41:27.845 --> 01:41:29.814
and they don't know where that is.

01:41:29.914 --> 01:41:31.583
What about your plans?

01:41:31.683 --> 01:41:33.918
Why don't you tell me about
your fucking plans?

01:41:34.018 --> 01:41:35.781
Maybe I'd like to hear them now.

01:41:37.989 --> 01:41:39.149
Plans.

01:41:42.727 --> 01:41:43.785
Plans?

01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:50.260
Once a loyalty's broken, baby,
you can never get it back.

01:41:51.636 --> 01:41:53.831
You should not have told them.

01:41:55.807 --> 01:41:59.010
There are a lot of things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:01.145
But that is not fucking one of them!

01:42:01.245 --> 01:42:02.974
Move out of my way!

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:06.639
Let me tell you something.

01:42:07.518 --> 01:42:10.783
The only difference between
a witness and a liar...

01:42:11.489 --> 01:42:14.287
is just one of them knows
what he's doing.

01:42:20.198 --> 01:42:21.324
No!

01:43:07.145 --> 01:43:10.012
- Shit!
- Manny, lock the door.

01:43:10.181 --> 01:43:11.409
Lock it!

01:43:12.116 --> 01:43:14.346
You scared the shit out of me.

01:43:19.757 --> 01:43:20.849
Shit.

01:43:23.394 --> 01:43:24.861
Manny.

01:43:26.697 --> 01:43:28.164
One more favor.

01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:33.066
Now, since when did I become
such a good fucking friend?

01:43:33.304 --> 01:43:36.603
Look, I'm thinking of taking
a little time off.

01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:41.938
Think you can get me a car tonight?

01:43:45.349 --> 01:43:46.475
Yeah, man.

01:43:47.618 --> 01:43:48.949
I can do that.

01:43:49.854 --> 01:43:52.156
But you know
you're hot as hell right now, right?

01:43:52.256 --> 01:43:53.951
And drivers that don't talk...

01:43:54.525 --> 01:43:56.083
don't come cheap.

01:43:57.295 --> 01:43:58.523
I got the money.

01:43:59.664 --> 01:44:01.154
Make it happen.

01:44:03.668 --> 01:44:06.904
Dr. Travis, you have
a visitor in Room 4.

01:44:07.004 --> 01:44:09.598
Dr. Travis, a visitor in Room 4.

01:44:12.243 --> 01:44:15.110
Dr. Florence, please dial 112.

01:44:19.817 --> 01:44:23.688
- Dr. Florence, dial 112.
- You want to do the op. Report?

01:44:23.788 --> 01:44:26.814
- Not if you do.
- How did you close?

01:44:33.931 --> 01:44:35.455
There you go, man.

01:44:37.068 --> 01:44:40.504
Leather seats, mini-bar, CD player.

01:44:41.005 --> 01:44:42.836
What more could you ask for?

01:44:43.708 --> 01:44:45.573
Better not be a setup.

01:44:46.244 --> 01:44:48.508
You want me to hold your hand, too?

01:44:51.215 --> 01:44:52.944
Walk me to the car.

01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:55.143
Shit.

01:45:12.703 --> 01:45:15.106
- I guess I'll let you live.
- You're a real prince.

01:45:15.206 --> 01:45:17.071
Give me my money, man.

01:45:19.944 --> 01:45:23.436
- You never saw me.
- Yeah, don't I wish that was true. Go on!

01:45:25.683 --> 01:45:28.083
Thank you, sir.

01:45:31.489 --> 01:45:33.320
Have a nice trip, shit.

01:45:37.995 --> 01:45:39.121
Go south.

01:45:39.764 --> 01:45:41.561
Get on the interstate.

01:45:41.966 --> 01:45:44.093
Don't break the speed limit.

01:45:51.943 --> 01:45:54.434
You know, that's the thing about life.

01:45:56.113 --> 01:45:59.048
You can never, ever
lose your sense of humor.

01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:02.944
Without it, you got nothing.

01:46:07.232 --> 01:46:09.066
Fucking A.
