05:38.647 --> 05:40.160
There's nothing to mention.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.675
You're fostering a kid.

05:42.727 --> 05:47.118
l know but, to be honest,
we never really thought it'd happen.

05:47.167 --> 05:50.762
What about the tests,
suitability assessments...

05:50.807 --> 05:53.162
they don't just give you a child.

05:55.927 --> 06:00.717

Don't tell me.

Emergency placement. Eric Tatchell.

07:47.527 --> 07:50.200
Ten years old, lovely lad.

07:50.247 --> 07:54.035
He was born in Ardwick, not the posh bit,

07:54.087 --> 07:59.161
but nice enough, so he won't be
stealing your purse to buy crack!

08:00.887 --> 08:04.800
Parents played the stock market,
got into debt, big debt.

08:04.847 --> 08:09.637
Day before repossession of the house,
they do a bunk to Malaga, in Spain.

08:09.687 --> 08:10.915
They neglected to tell Eric.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.242
They went without him?!

08:13.287 --> 08:16.563
Oh, l've seen it all in my game.
You'd be shocked.

08:16.607 --> 08:20.043
lt's always the snooty ones that are the worst.

08:20.087 --> 08:22.806
Give me people like you any day of the week.

08:25.287 --> 08:29.565
The trial placement lets you see
how fostering suits you

08:29.607 --> 08:34.840
and lets me find more permanent care for Eric.
Everyone's a winner!

08:34.886 --> 08:38.674
Try and think of it as a dress rehearsal -

08:38.727 --> 08:41.400
top marks and we'll find you
something longer term.

08:41.447 --> 08:43.198
How long before we get him?

08:43.246 --> 08:45.966
Oh, did l not mention? >

08:46.007 --> 08:48.282
He's waiting in the car.

09:01.567 --> 09:06.687
Eric, l'd like to introduce you
to your new temporary foster parents -

09:06.727 --> 09:09.446
Veronica and Kelvin Ball.

09:11.047 --> 09:12.765
You can call me Kev.

09:20.047 --> 09:21.958
Come on, then.

09:27.287 --> 09:31.075
Treat the place like your own.
Whatever you want, it's yours.

09:31.127 --> 09:34.005
lf you're hungry, eat. lf you're thirsty, drink.

09:34.047 --> 09:37.244
Just keep your hands off my lagers.

09:37.287 --> 09:42.156
We want you to feel at home,
so anything you want to know, just ask.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.084
Who are they?

09:44.127 --> 09:46.038
Ah, the neighbours.

09:49.287 --> 09:50.561
You all right, Carol?

09:50.607 --> 09:54.043
Oh, don't mind me. Being nosey.

09:54.087 --> 09:56.237
You've got it nice up here, Fiona.

09:56.287 --> 09:58.278
We like it.

09:58.327 --> 10:01.603
Big house, though, just for the two of you.

10:04.007 --> 10:07.522
Lip, lan, Carl,

10:07.567 --> 10:09.603
Steve, and the lovely young Debbie.

10:11.887 --> 10:13.286
That's my brother, Marty.

10:13.327 --> 10:16.637
Lick of paint, couple of rugs,
get it proper nice...

10:16.687 --> 10:19.406
And that's my mum, Carol.

10:21.127 --> 10:23.800
And my best friend, Fiona.

10:23.847 --> 10:26.236
He's like a little street urchin.

10:26.287 --> 10:29.563
So, why don't you play a game or something?

10:29.607 --> 10:30.926
Show Eric your table football.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.480
No chance!

10:32.527 --> 10:35.803
l'll show you upstairs. l've got the biggest room.

10:41.887 --> 10:44.526
They can't stay here, Veronica.

10:44.567 --> 10:48.526
Please, Fiona, it won't be for long.
Just while we've got Eric.

10:48.567 --> 10:52.640
The idea was to give us more space, not less.
What about Marty?

10:52.687 --> 10:58.284
He only burns things when he's angry.
Keep him away from me mam's fellas.

11:00.207 --> 11:03.483
OK. But only till they get themselves sorted.

11:03.527 --> 11:05.916
Thank you, thank you!

11:05.967 --> 11:08.003
PUMPlNG

11:08.047 --> 11:09.924
Eric?

11:09.967 --> 11:11.923
Debbie?

11:11.967 --> 11:14.003
Acute appendicitis.

11:14.047 --> 11:16.322
We're going to have to operate.

11:16.367 --> 11:19.165
Come on, Eric, l think it's time to go home.

11:24.687 --> 11:29.761
lt's great, innit,
our own little kiddie in the house?

11:29.807 --> 11:31.923
He's a right miserable little twat.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.366
Kev!

11:33.407 --> 11:38.037
We have to make a go of this
if we want to do it full-time.

11:38.087 --> 11:40.476
You heard what the social worker said.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.917
Screw this up, and we'll not get another.

11:48.127 --> 11:50.163
How tired are you?

11:50.207 --> 11:53.597
We can't. What if he hears?

11:53.647 --> 11:56.036
We'll do it with the volume down.

12:10.847 --> 12:13.520
Just wank us off, then.

12:18.327 --> 12:20.204
Eric?

12:27.327 --> 12:29.443
Eric?

12:29.487 --> 12:32.559
E... Oh, there you are.

12:32.607 --> 12:34.996
Uniform. Good boy.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.481
Breakfast.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.527
Right. Juice?

12:43.567 --> 12:44.795
Eric?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.315
Eric?!

12:48.447 --> 12:50.677
K-E-E-E-V!

12:50.727 --> 12:52.524
Please don't do this to me now!

12:52.567 --> 12:54.637
Don't pump it, you'll flood the fucking engine!

12:54.687 --> 12:57.201
lf you had a decent car
this wouldn't be a problem!

12:57.247 --> 12:58.441
He's turning green!

12:58.487 --> 13:02.002
- You worked in a fucking hospital!
- Yeah, as a fucking cleaner!

13:02.047 --> 13:03.275
What's going on?

13:03.327 --> 13:04.680
They killed him!

13:04.727 --> 13:06.718
What's happened to him?

13:06.767 --> 13:09.565
Found him on the dining-room table,
white as a sheet!

13:09.607 --> 13:10.562
Call an ambulance!

13:10.607 --> 13:13.644
Like my Uncle Pete?
He'll be dead when they get here!

13:13.687 --> 13:18.283
Well, you won't get him there in this!
Steve's car! STEVE!

13:21.447 --> 13:23.278
Get the keys!

13:23.327 --> 13:25.079
How did you find him?

13:25.127 --> 13:26.082
Just lying there!

13:26.127 --> 13:29.244
Like he'd collapsed
or like he'd taken something?

13:29.287 --> 13:30.197
He's not topped himself!

13:30.247 --> 13:32.124
Kids do, especially in care...

13:32.167 --> 13:33.919
Steve!

13:33.967 --> 13:37.243
Maybe he's allergic, like me with eggs.
Did they tell you anything?

13:37.287 --> 13:40.006
No, they just... He's a kid!

13:40.047 --> 13:41.605
How can anyone give us a kid!

13:41.647 --> 13:42.796
All right.

13:42.847 --> 13:45.964
POLlCE SlREN WAlLS

13:46.007 --> 13:47.406
ls that for us?

13:47.447 --> 13:49.722
Tell them we're rushing him to hospital.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.725
They'll probably give us an escort.

13:54.607 --> 13:56.677
'Who's been fingerprinted?'

13:57.807 --> 13:59.445
Has anyone here been fingerprinted?

13:59.487 --> 14:01.557
What you on about?

14:01.607 --> 14:03.996
Oh, Jesus, Jesus.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.877
Eric, mate? You all right, mate?

14:07.927 --> 14:11.078
Be sick again if you need to.
Get it all up, darling.

14:11.127 --> 14:13.960
What's he got in here?

14:14.007 --> 14:16.043
lt's hash cake. From the party!

14:18.807 --> 14:21.275
He's been at the hash cake. He's gonna live!

14:21.327 --> 14:22.919
Hold on tight.

14:24.047 --> 14:25.844
lt's only a bit of hash cake!

14:25.887 --> 14:27.878
This isn't my car.

14:52.807 --> 14:55.844
Can you believe that? Nicked car?

14:55.887 --> 14:57.957
You feeling any better?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.039
< Fucking car thief?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.636
You've gone up in my estimation.

15:17.687 --> 15:19.917
So, were they all nicked?

15:19.967 --> 15:22.197
Wondered where the flash came from.

15:22.247 --> 15:24.636
We kept it secret for a good reason.

15:24.687 --> 15:28.396
Less people know,
less chance there is of getting caught.

15:28.447 --> 15:30.642
Don't go spreading it round, right?

15:30.687 --> 15:32.200
Can't wait to tell Lip.

15:32.247 --> 15:33.521
You nearly killed us all!

15:33.567 --> 15:36.957
Fiona, there was no other way.

15:37.007 --> 15:39.202
Dicky tummy.

15:39.247 --> 15:42.523
Yeah, might have been something he's eaten.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.956
We're getting plenty of fluids down him,

15:45.007 --> 15:47.475
so he should be right as rain soon.

15:47.527 --> 15:51.440
No, no, no, no, everything's fine, yeah, yeah.

15:51.487 --> 15:54.524
We'll bring him in this afternoon. Bye!

15:57.927 --> 16:00.521
Do you fancy a piece of cake?

16:05.047 --> 16:09.165
We can do this, Kev. We can be good parents.

16:09.207 --> 16:14.918
From now on, we just have to
try really hard not to kill him.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.527
This is hard work, V.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.717
We're doing fine.

17:09.926 --> 17:11.917
Who's this?

17:13.527 --> 17:15.358
He could crack a smile!

17:15.406 --> 17:18.160
His mum and dad do a bunk,

17:18.207 --> 17:22.519
social services lumber him with two strangers
in an area he hardly knows.

17:22.567 --> 17:25.161
Don't think l'd be doing cartwheels.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.727
We've gotta work at it.

17:28.767 --> 17:31.804
This is how it'll be when we have our own.

17:31.847 --> 17:35.237
But that'll be ours. l'll know what to say to ours.

17:38.887 --> 17:40.718
Gotta go to work.

17:41.847 --> 17:43.326
You be all right?

17:43.367 --> 17:45.835
Yeah, l'll be fine.

17:54.327 --> 17:56.318
Killer! He's the killer!

18:02.007 --> 18:05.761
Can Debbie come out to play?

18:10.647 --> 18:15.084
Don't know how you've managed five of them,
practically on your own.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.278
You can't magic a bond, Veronica,
it takes time.

18:18.327 --> 18:23.799
l know, and l really wanna make it work, but...

18:23.847 --> 18:26.600
l haven't got a clue what l'm doing.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.003
No-one has. You've just got to find
your own way through.

18:30.047 --> 18:32.163
Cheers, mate.

18:33.687 --> 18:35.837
Here's to kids. Little shitbags.

18:36.847 --> 18:41.682
That's the trouble with fostering, adoption.
lt's like...

18:41.727 --> 18:44.366
having someone else's shoes, innit?

18:44.407 --> 18:48.366
You don't want 'em after they've been worn in.

18:48.407 --> 18:51.240
lt's like you wanna put your mark on them.

18:51.287 --> 18:54.279
Little bit of yourself in the next generation.

18:54.327 --> 18:57.364
Mind you, they only end up hating you,
so what's the fucking point?

18:57.407 --> 18:59.204
BABY CRlES

19:17.607 --> 19:19.199
Hiya!

19:19.247 --> 19:20.919
How's my two favourite boys?

19:20.967 --> 19:23.435
Get lost! Just bog off!

19:23.487 --> 19:26.445
- What's the matter with him?
- Lost his sketch pad.

19:26.487 --> 19:29.923
Well, did he tell a teacher?
Maybe someone took it.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.686
Well, did you ask him?

19:34.167 --> 19:37.045
Veronica, this fostering...

19:37.087 --> 19:40.238
l'm not sure if we've made a mistake.

19:40.287 --> 19:44.075
We should call Marissa Platting,
tell her we're not up to it.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.764
ls this because we haven't had sex all week?

19:48.807 --> 19:49.956
No, it's just...

19:50.007 --> 19:53.283
lt is, isn't it?! Kev! Brilliant(!)

19:53.327 --> 19:55.795
Typical bloke, always thinking with THAT.

19:55.847 --> 20:00.477
lf we can't do a good job,
what chance do we have of getting another?

20:00.527 --> 20:02.995
Don't know if l want another one.

20:04.847 --> 20:07.441
Well, this was your idea.

20:07.487 --> 20:10.559
No, it wasn't. lt was yours.

20:11.607 --> 20:13.757
l went along with it. For you.

20:13.807 --> 20:17.641
l want us to have a kid,
and l can't give you one any other way.

20:23.527 --> 20:26.439
Sorry, calling round at this time.

20:26.487 --> 20:29.524
Wouldn't have bothered you
if it wasn't important.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.842
l need a word with Steve.

20:33.287 --> 20:36.484
Green Cherokee, Easton Street car park,
last Friday.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.166
lt was you, wasn't it?

20:39.207 --> 20:42.199
You've been caught on CCTV.

20:42.247 --> 20:45.922
They can't tell it's you.
But it needs to go back. Like now.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.844
Whose is it?

20:47.887 --> 20:51.004
Chief lnspector's. Well, his missus.

20:51.047 --> 20:55.086
Pride and joy, apparently.
He wants the bastard's head on a stick.

20:55.127 --> 20:57.482
Shit, Steve!

20:59.367 --> 21:03.201
He's pulling out all the stops.
Overtime, the works.

21:03.247 --> 21:06.398
You'd think we were after a serial killer.

21:06.447 --> 21:09.280
You have still got it?

21:11.087 --> 21:13.078
Yeah, it's safe.

21:17.247 --> 21:18.236
Shit.

21:21.527 --> 21:24.564
Come on, it's time for school. Eric!

21:24.607 --> 21:26.120
Not going!

21:26.167 --> 21:28.886
School! Everyone has to go to school.

21:28.927 --> 21:30.838
Get lost.

21:31.687 --> 21:33.598
Come on, Eric, you...

21:33.647 --> 21:34.966
Whoa!

21:35.007 --> 21:36.326
Leave me alone!

21:36.367 --> 21:39.040
What's the story?

21:41.087 --> 21:43.920
Eric, mate...
You haven't pissed the bed, have you?

21:43.967 --> 21:49.599
Why can't you leave me alone?
Why can't everyone leave me alone?!

22:07.287 --> 22:07.958
Huh?!

22:08.007 --> 22:09.235
You are?

22:09.287 --> 22:11.118
Eric? Eric!

22:13.167 --> 22:16.000
A green Grand Cherokee. All right?

22:16.047 --> 22:18.845
lf anything comes up,
you've got to give me a call.

22:18.887 --> 22:21.242
Steve, you seen young Eric?

22:21.287 --> 22:25.724
No, no. Promise me, Grand Cherokee, green.
Got that?

22:28.647 --> 22:31.445
Fuck you doing in here?

22:31.487 --> 22:33.239
Only place l can get some peace.

22:33.287 --> 22:36.324
Haven't seen the kid, have you?

22:36.367 --> 22:38.835
No, Kev, haven't seen him anywhere.

22:42.447 --> 22:44.438
Come on, mate. School.

22:44.487 --> 22:45.886
No!

22:45.927 --> 22:46.962
lf he doesn't wanna go, Kev.

22:47.487 --> 22:50.206
He has to go to school, Frank. lt's the law.

22:50.247 --> 22:52.477
Law? Law of the fucking jungle.

22:52.527 --> 22:54.563
Do you remember school?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.643
That bloke had it right, Lord Of The Flies...

22:56.687 --> 22:58.962
They're fucking cannibals.

23:00.327 --> 23:02.158
Come on, mate.

23:05.647 --> 23:06.636
(Frank) What's he doing now?

23:06.687 --> 23:08.962
Nowt. Just walking about.

23:14.607 --> 23:17.440
Breaks your heart.
Who'd be that age again, eh?

23:17.487 --> 23:20.240
(Frank) Best years of your life.

23:23.567 --> 23:26.604
Take that look off your mush,
you sour-faced bitch.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.239
We're fucking parents, not perverts.

23:28.287 --> 23:31.518
Frank! You trying to get us reported?

23:33.847 --> 23:36.202
Where is he?

23:36.247 --> 23:37.236
Bottom left-hand side.

23:37.407 --> 23:39.841
Left-hand... He's vanished.

23:39.887 --> 23:42.162
Where the fuck's he...

23:45.327 --> 23:47.045
(Frank) Oh no.

23:47.087 --> 23:49.760
What? What is it?

23:49.807 --> 23:51.923
There.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.922
Jesus Christ!

24:01.967 --> 24:04.276
(Frank) l know. Fucking girls.

24:05.327 --> 24:07.522
Are you gonna just fucking sit there?
Do something!

24:07.567 --> 24:08.716
Like what?

24:09.887 --> 24:15.245
That is your son. You're his protector.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.245
Cometh the hour, cometh the man...

24:18.847 --> 24:21.566
- What you doing?
- We're going in!

24:21.607 --> 24:23.598
No, no, no, hang on...

24:28.007 --> 24:30.282
Get out the way!

24:32.527 --> 24:34.882
Get in!

24:39.527 --> 24:41.438
Dentist's. Running late.

24:48.447 --> 24:51.484
Drop us at the Jockey on the way home.

24:51.527 --> 24:55.805
You can't just snatch a kid
and get away with it, you daft sod!

24:55.847 --> 24:59.920
You didn't see it! They were turning him over.
Poor little shit.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.320
He's a fucking pansy.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.642
He's not! Girls are scary at that age.

25:03.687 --> 25:06.759
lf you don't stop it,
he'll spend his life being bullied.

25:06.807 --> 25:10.038
lan's right. He can't spend his life
being bossed about by women.

25:10.087 --> 25:12.237
Why not? You do!

25:13.607 --> 25:15.802
He needs toughening up a bit.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.042
Admit it, you've fostered a pansy.

25:18.087 --> 25:19.884
Lip?

25:19.927 --> 25:22.043
< What's up, you fucking pansy?

25:55.447 --> 25:57.438
No joy?

25:57.487 --> 25:59.876
lt's only a matter of time. lt'll be OK.

25:59.927 --> 26:03.124
- What if it all turns bad, Steve?
- lt won't.

26:03.167 --> 26:06.079
You nicked a copper's car!
lf they catch you, they'll screw you.

26:06.127 --> 26:08.083
- They won't.
- How do you know?

26:08.127 --> 26:12.837
You're not charmed. You walk around
like you're immune to bad luck.

26:12.887 --> 26:17.597
Things go wrong. People get caught.
That's what happens. That's life!

26:17.647 --> 26:20.207
Hey, hey. Look.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.442
l don't want to lose you.

26:26.727 --> 26:29.719
Look. Everything's solvable.

26:29.767 --> 26:33.521
l'll find a replacement, trust me. All right?

26:42.247 --> 26:45.922
Male child, ten years old.
Restraint of parents vital.

26:45.967 --> 26:49.676
< Upstairs! Come on, upstairs!

26:50.807 --> 26:51.796
What's going on?

26:51.847 --> 26:53.758
Aye-aye?!

26:53.807 --> 26:55.604
Get your hands off me!

26:55.647 --> 26:58.115
GENERAL HUBBUB

26:58.167 --> 26:59.441
< What are you doing?

26:59.487 --> 27:01.717
< Kev, what are they doing?

27:01.767 --> 27:04.804
Where are you going with him?
Marissa, where are you going?

27:04.847 --> 27:07.759
Get off me! You're hurting me!

27:07.807 --> 27:09.399
Get off!

27:10.447 --> 27:11.880
MARlSSA?! >

27:11.927 --> 27:14.600
< Kev, just leave it.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.923
What's going on? Where are they taking him?

27:18.967 --> 27:20.958
Keep out and get back indoors.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.043
They're taking Eric.

27:33.767 --> 27:35.325
lt's all my fault.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.961
You haven't done anything wrong.

27:38.007 --> 27:40.680
School must have told them
about The ltalian Job.

27:40.727 --> 27:46.245
Or maybe they decided they'd made
a big fucking mistake giving us a kid.

27:46.287 --> 27:50.724
Just wish l could have another chance.
One more chance.

27:55.727 --> 27:57.763
lt's them again!

28:04.407 --> 28:06.523
< They've brought him back!

28:06.567 --> 28:09.445
Three times in the last six months
this has happened.

28:10.687 --> 28:13.155
< We were supposed to be in Brighall Street.

28:13.207 --> 28:15.880
Ah! Look.

28:15.927 --> 28:20.159
Somehow your details got put in by mistake.

28:21.527 --> 28:24.166
< We'll write to you about compensation,

28:24.207 --> 28:27.085
but you'll appreciate it was a genuine mistake.

28:30.327 --> 28:32.522
Welcome home, mate.

28:33.527 --> 28:38.396
You were scary, there. l thought you
were going to take his head off.

28:38.447 --> 28:41.837
You wanna use that, you know.
ln the playground.

28:46.807 --> 28:50.322
Same thing happened to me
when l was your age.

28:50.367 --> 28:54.758
Tough kids...picking on me, giving it all that.

28:58.527 --> 29:03.396
lt's hard to believe, but l wasn't
the best-looking kid in the world.

29:03.447 --> 29:05.085
No...

29:05.127 --> 29:08.324
Greasy hair, spots.
They used to call me Dot To Dot.

29:12.487 --> 29:14.478
Made my life a misery.

29:15.487 --> 29:20.800
Then one day l cracked,
decided to do something about it.

29:20.847 --> 29:25.443
So l got me old fella to teach me
how to box. Proper lessons.

29:25.487 --> 29:29.036
Then l knew, whatever happened,

29:29.087 --> 29:32.079
l'd always be able to stand up for myself.

29:34.447 --> 29:38.838
l know your old fella's flown south,
but if you're interested...

29:40.607 --> 29:42.677
l can always teach you.

29:47.727 --> 29:49.285
You're on.

29:51.847 --> 29:55.522
LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!

29:57.087 --> 30:01.797
Right, remember what l said. Jab.
Left, right, left, right. One-two.

30:01.847 --> 30:04.122
Get your head up! Bang bang bang!

30:04.167 --> 30:08.797
One...two...three...

30:08.847 --> 30:11.998
< Right, keep 'em up.
Stop pumping and puffing.

30:12.047 --> 30:14.720
Focus, concentrate, keep your balance.

30:14.767 --> 30:17.839
Hey, l told you about that,
they're rabbit punches.

30:17.887 --> 30:20.321
Come on, dig in. Four.

30:20.367 --> 30:23.882
Five. That's it. Six.

30:23.927 --> 30:26.680
You're wearing yourself out! Get your arms up!

30:26.727 --> 30:29.878
Give me a big right. That's it! Good lad!

30:29.927 --> 30:31.599
- Tosspot!
- Tosspot!

30:31.647 --> 30:32.682
- Spunkface!
- Spunkface!

30:32.727 --> 30:34.479
- Bucket biff!
- Bucket biff!

30:34.527 --> 30:36.085
That one's only for girls.

30:39.847 --> 30:41.803
< Come on, Eric!

30:41.847 --> 30:44.884
CHEERS OF SUPPORT FOR ERlC

30:49.727 --> 30:52.116
Hit me! Come on, hit me!

30:56.647 --> 31:00.322

She's my mother!
You don't touch my mother - ever!

35:19.887 --> 35:22.720

Now, where's it gone?

39:26.807 --> 39:28.559
Oh, right, right.

and that's you finished.
Where is the little fella, anyway?

39:39.927 --> 39:41.918

40:21.607 --> 40:23.484
How come you only did Evelyn?

40:23.527 --> 40:25.563
She's the leader.

40:25.607 --> 40:27.438
She tells everyone what to do.

40:27.487 --> 40:29.796
Didn't need to do the others after that.

40:29.847 --> 40:32.919
Come on, you two, time to go.

Nice to meet you.

l'm not saying never...

42:58.487 --> 43:00.682

43:01.727 --> 43:06.243
Because once we've got all that,
we won't have all this.

43:07.287 --> 43:09.676
And if it ain't broke...

43:16.327 --> 43:21.162
(Frank) 'Now, don't get me wrong,

Come on, everybody.
You can help me peel the potatoes.

(Fiona) 'Have you noticed anything unusual?'

43:51.927 --> 43:55.283
Everywhere you turn,
people have started...gardening.

43:55.327 --> 43:58.125
There's a year's free rent
