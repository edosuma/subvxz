WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:10.532
[sizzling]

00:18.192 --> 00:21.108
- These murders are in danger
of agitating the poor and,

00:21.151 --> 00:23.501
more importantly,
they target us.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.156
So, then what we need to do,
clearly...

00:26.200 --> 00:27.766
[clears throat]

00:27.810 --> 00:29.725
Yes, Gladys. Serve the meal,

00:29.768 --> 00:30.943
then be gone.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.336
Yes, Mr. Garvey.

00:34.512 --> 00:35.774
Miss.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.522
- Please close the door
on your way out.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.094
- Does anyone feel uneasy
discussing these things

00:51.138 --> 00:53.227
with your staff
in such close proximity?

00:53.270 --> 00:55.577
- My staff know they'd pay
with their lives

00:55.620 --> 00:57.187
if anything were
to ever be repeated.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.668
Now can we please get
on with the subject at hand?

00:59.711 --> 01:01.235
As I was saying,

01:01.278 --> 01:06.109
what we need to do is find
Georges Rondeau and kill him.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.068
- Yeah.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.460
We have laws in this land.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.680
- Mm, right.
I'd almost forgotten.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.420
I, for one, would sleep
more comfortably knowing

01:13.464 --> 01:17.120
for sure that we caught
the actual guilty party.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.513
- Of course Georges
is the killer.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.428
The murders started
the moment he arrived.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.864
- Or his showing up
is the perfect distraction

01:21.907 --> 01:22.995
for someone devious.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.781
- Fine. So, we capture him.
- How?

01:25.824 --> 01:27.478
He's as slippery
as an eel.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.133
- And after Eddie's,
pardon my French,

01:30.176 --> 01:32.614
fuck up,
he knows we're after him.

01:33.658 --> 01:36.313
- It's getting cold! Eat up.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.009
There must be something
that would lure him.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.752
- Mm. Good.

01:40.795 --> 01:41.840
[gasping]

01:41.884 --> 01:43.146
- Venetia!

01:43.190 --> 01:46.541
- Melanda, dearest,
could you check our lovely

01:46.584 --> 01:47.933
friend to see if she's having
a stroke?

01:47.977 --> 01:49.761
- My sister, the frisson

01:49.805 --> 01:52.590
between she and Georges
is positively "aphrodesic".

01:52.634 --> 01:54.244
She may know where he is.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.942
If not, we can use her
as a lure.

01:56.985 --> 01:57.769
Hm?

01:57.813 --> 01:58.640
- The only way

01:58.683 --> 01:59.423
to Georges Rondeau's heart

01:59.467 --> 02:00.816
is through his billfold.

02:00.859 --> 02:01.904
[scoffs]

02:01.947 --> 02:02.948
- Okay, so using some

02:02.992 --> 02:04.341
kind of hocus-pocus,

02:04.385 --> 02:05.516
we trick the murderous

02:05.560 --> 02:06.735
magician to meet
your sister where?

02:06.778 --> 02:08.693
- The Queen's Chamber.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.651
- You think he'll feel safe
at The Queen's Chamber?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.958
- After what we did there?
- Hm.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.264
- No.

02:15.787 --> 02:18.703
- Forget using Venetia as
a lure, use one of these pies.

02:18.747 --> 02:21.184
Tastiest damn pies
I've ever eaten. What is it?

02:21.228 --> 02:23.752
Pork? It's a little
too gamey for pork.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.275
Boar?

02:25.319 --> 02:27.408
- All right,
so we get ahold of him somehow,

02:27.843 --> 02:29.323
then what? Public trial?

02:29.366 --> 02:30.846
- Yes, a public trial.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.241
It's not like Georges Rondeau
is a nobody whore.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.851
His fans are going to wonder
what happened to him.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.897
- Are you insane?
The people will be on his side.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.161
- SalomÃ©, as always, is right.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.293
I mean, The Widow's killing
the rich and the famous,

02:43.337 --> 02:44.642
something they wish
they could do.

02:46.514 --> 02:49.908
- So we make it look like
he's a victim of The Widow.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.041
I know I can think of
a few sick perverted things

02:52.084 --> 02:53.216
I'd like to do to Georges.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.000
- Ooh, Daddy, do tell.

02:55.043 --> 02:58.090
- No, no, no, no. People!
We gotta do this by the book.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.267
We gotta send a message around
that you can't just go around

03:00.310 --> 03:01.529
killing rich people.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.183
What the fuck is that?

03:03.922 --> 03:05.315
A bone?

03:07.361 --> 03:09.537
[suspenseful music]

03:11.756 --> 03:14.194
It's a tooth.
It's a human fucking tooth!

03:14.237 --> 03:15.847
[gasping]

03:17.153 --> 03:18.720
[gagging]

03:33.474 --> 03:34.605
- Basil...

03:52.144 --> 03:54.843
- The only person I know
with that many gold teeth is...

03:56.410 --> 03:58.586
was...

03:58.629 --> 04:00.283
Eddie.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.983
[suspenseful music]

04:09.640 --> 04:12.252
[gagging]

04:18.387 --> 04:20.651
- There's words
at the bottom of mine.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.920
"The unjust."

04:30.008 --> 04:32.837
- Another message
from The Widow?

04:32.881 --> 04:34.491
- I'm unjust?

04:36.188 --> 04:39.844
- "Justice for."
- "Justice for the unjust."

04:41.716 --> 04:44.109
- "Piping hot."
- "Served."

04:49.114 --> 04:51.334
- Okay...

04:51.378 --> 04:58.210
"Justice for the unjust.
Best served piping hot."

04:58.733 --> 05:01.779
- What the fuck?

05:01.823 --> 05:02.998
Gladys!

05:06.523 --> 05:08.438
- Sir, I don't know
how that could have happened.

05:08.482 --> 05:12.137
Please don't be cross with me--
- I will not be cross with you,

05:12.181 --> 05:14.966
Gladys, if you tell me who put
the meat in these fucking pies,

05:15.010 --> 05:16.968
because if you can't,
then I'm going to have to

05:17.012 --> 05:19.057
assume that it was you.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.059
- Her? The Widow? That's insane.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.757
- I get them from your butcher,
Yorgi, sir.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.020
- Who brought them to you?
How long ago?

05:25.063 --> 05:26.891
- I didn't know him.
It was very dark.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.110
- What did he look like?!

05:28.806 --> 05:31.026
- Uh, he had
a cap hiding his face.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.682
I'm sorry, sir. I told you
that they're my secret recipe,

05:34.725 --> 05:36.161
but I've been lying.
I'm so sorry.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.948
- Go.

05:39.991 --> 05:40.862
Go!

05:40.905 --> 05:42.037
[gasping, whimpering]

05:42.907 --> 05:44.126
- She was here.

05:44.169 --> 05:47.216
- He. Georges is our Widow.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.392
- A master of disguise, too.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.221
He's always five steps
ahead of us. What do we do?

05:52.264 --> 05:53.701
How do we fight this?

05:53.744 --> 05:56.356
- Oh, pull yourself together,
for Christ's sake.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.967
It's Georges. Plain old
"pick a card" Georges.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.230
We just have
to find the viper.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.363
And we will.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.364
[suspenseful music]

06:04.407 --> 06:05.539
- The cook broke down

06:05.582 --> 06:06.583
and told us Basil's fancy pies

06:06.627 --> 06:08.193
were made in here.

06:09.673 --> 06:10.631
[speaking foreign language]

06:12.197 --> 06:13.634
- Oy.

06:14.896 --> 06:18.726
Who are you and what
are you doing in my abattoir?

06:19.248 --> 06:23.861
- Yorgi. Superintendent
Kashtinsky and this

06:23.905 --> 06:25.385
is Detective Rijkers.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.951
- We're here because something

06:26.995 --> 06:28.736
went wrong with the recent order

06:28.779 --> 06:31.652
of pies you sent
'round to the Garvey household.

06:31.956 --> 06:32.957
- Gone wrong how?

06:33.001 --> 06:34.045
- There was a sprinkling

06:34.089 --> 06:36.831
of human teeth
in the latest batch.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.093
- What...

06:38.136 --> 06:40.269
- I pulled one right
out of my own mouth,

06:40.312 --> 06:41.401
I don't mind saying.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.534
- I don't see
how that could happen.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.101
There's always
one of us in here.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.712
- Where exactly
do you make the pies?

06:48.756 --> 06:51.498
- The pies are
assembled over there.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.591
What are you doing?

06:57.634 --> 06:58.808
- Who makes the pies?

06:58.853 --> 07:01.464
- Mal'chik.
Boys, uh,

07:01.508 --> 07:05.337
little ones still too small
to do the heavy work.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.904
- How small are we talking?

07:06.948 --> 07:09.603
- Young. Eleven, twelve.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.692
- So, uh, not potential killers.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.390
- They not yet strong enough
to lift leg of lamb.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.045
- How hard would you say it
is to get in here at night?

07:17.088 --> 07:19.351
- I've done it
a couple times.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.658
My wife, you know,
she give me hell.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.270
- I think I got something.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.359
- Eddie?

07:27.403 --> 07:29.579
- What you mean, Eddie?

07:37.805 --> 07:39.371
- Oh, it's human.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.461
- Eddie.
- That Eddie?!

07:41.852 --> 07:43.724
Eddie would I know?

07:43.767 --> 07:45.421
- Where's the rest of him?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.510
- If he's in the pie,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.078
he could be... any one these
mince and mix trays.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.210
[uneasy music]

07:54.648 --> 07:56.867
- The attack starts
on the body here at the lower

07:56.911 --> 07:58.260
fifth lumbar vertebrae.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.131
It's the least extreme
of the hits.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.308
- But bad enough to paralyze
Eddie from the waist down?

08:03.352 --> 08:04.614
- Mm-hmm.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.268
[screaming]

08:06.311 --> 08:08.357
- And next, he's hit here,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.141
at the thoracic vertebrae...

08:10.185 --> 08:11.621
[screaming]

08:11.665 --> 08:14.581
...ending here at
the top cervical vertebrae.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.149
It's the most brutal
of the all the strikes.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.500
Interesting.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.893
- What?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.679
- If I was to kill a man,
I'd start at that point,

08:25.722 --> 08:27.028
not end there.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.203
The killer took their time.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.467
It was violent,
methodical,

08:32.294 --> 08:33.643
at her mercy.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.078
No muscle control.

08:35.123 --> 08:35.905
[screaming]

08:35.950 --> 08:37.125
Suffocating.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.779
Alive until the bitter end.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.433
- Suffering. It's just what
The Widow wanted.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.002
It's a message.
- Whoever The Widow is,

08:45.046 --> 08:47.788
they know a thing or two
about human physiology.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.616
- Someone like you?

08:51.966 --> 08:53.445
- But I'm right-handed,

08:54.055 --> 08:55.970
while the killer
uses their left.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.972
Does that clear me,
Detective?

08:58.276 --> 09:01.236
- More pressing question is does
it clear Georges Rondeau?

09:05.936 --> 09:07.503
[sighing]

09:07.547 --> 09:09.374
[uneasy music]

09:25.347 --> 09:29.699
- Fortuna, Prosperitas
et Abundantia.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.267
Habeo Omnia,

09:32.310 --> 09:35.923
Pecunia venit ad me.

09:35.966 --> 09:41.232
Habeo Omnia. Dives sum,

09:41.276 --> 09:46.411
Totus sum. Habeo Omnia,

09:47.064 --> 09:50.067
Habeo Omnia.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.157
Regina Simcoe.

09:55.812 --> 09:56.726
[knocking]

09:56.770 --> 09:57.684
- Georges?

09:59.903 --> 10:01.557
- I need to speak with him.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.821
- As do I. Dress rehearsal
started an hour ago.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.388
- You haven't heard from him?

10:06.431 --> 10:07.868
- Not since yesterday.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.740
- Do you know where
he was last night?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.873
- Did you not hear me when
I said I haven't heard from

10:12.916 --> 10:13.961
him since yesterday afternoon?

10:14.004 --> 10:15.310
- If you had to guess...

10:15.832 --> 10:17.617
- Georges knows many
people in town,

10:18.095 --> 10:19.096
many he hopes to see.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.620
And then there are always

10:20.663 --> 10:23.187
admirers looking to commune

10:23.231 --> 10:25.276
with him after the shows.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.889
- Tell me, what is Georges'
handedness?

10:28.932 --> 10:31.239
- Left. Why?

10:31.282 --> 10:32.762
- Hmm.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.897
- If you're going to continue
to be rude and mysterious,

10:36.940 --> 10:38.333
I'd like you to leave.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.290
- Oh, you would?

10:41.162 --> 10:43.599
Let me make something very clear
for you, young lady.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.732
If you know anything,

10:45.775 --> 10:48.473
you need to tell me. Now.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.826
- Georges could be
at Regina Simcoe's.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.218
- Why her?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.003
- Your guess is as good as mine.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.308
He's obsessed with the woman.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.793
[sighs]

11:04.359 --> 11:07.231
[uneasy music]

11:07.754 --> 11:09.494
[deep breathing]

11:18.547 --> 11:20.244
- Don't stop.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.593
[sighs]

11:25.597 --> 11:26.424
- Mm.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.905
- Oh...

11:31.168 --> 11:32.996
Ah...

11:39.873 --> 11:41.004
Don't stop...

11:57.804 --> 11:59.762
- I'm waiting for you.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.807
- Don't go!

12:02.939 --> 12:04.245
[gasping]

12:04.288 --> 12:05.202
Don't leave me!

12:06.856 --> 12:08.075
[knocking]

12:08.902 --> 12:10.381
[door opening]

12:10.425 --> 12:11.556
- Sorry to intrude, ma'am.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.429
- It's fine.
It's fine. What is it?

12:14.472 --> 12:16.910
- The Great Georges Rondeau
is waiting for you downstairs.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.389
Should I send him away?

12:19.173 --> 12:20.652
- No, um...

12:21.697 --> 12:23.177
Tell him I'll be down presently.

12:28.835 --> 12:32.273
I must apologize to you,
Mr. Rondeau.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.710
- My goodness, whatever for?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.669
- I was hot-tempered the other
day. You know it's true.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.497
- Oh! You have been
through so much.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.241
- Yes, I am
still deeply mourning.

12:45.808 --> 12:49.681
- That, my dear,
is why I'm here.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.684
I come bearing
salves.

12:52.728 --> 12:56.732
Made from the herbs and essences
of the Peruvian witch doctors.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.388
Only I carry on
their great teachings.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.738
- What exactly is it?

13:03.608 --> 13:07.569
- A tonic
for what truly ails you.

13:07.612 --> 13:11.834
It will soothe your gentle soul
and cleanse you of your grief.

13:12.966 --> 13:17.013
It is the only thing that saved
me when I lost my dear love,

13:17.057 --> 13:19.233
Budiwati,
to the flu of '86.

13:19.276 --> 13:23.846
- I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.326
You know of grief?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.502
- I do.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.548
It is one more
thing we have in common.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.161
My soul was shredded
at her loss.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.642
- I, too, feel torn to pieces.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.300
I do not know how I will ever
escape this dark tunnel.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.260
Life feels over.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.611
Or I want it to be.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.701
How am I to go on when...

13:56.574 --> 13:58.359
When my everything is gone?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.143
[whimpering]

14:00.622 --> 14:05.322
- Drink and you will find your
way through, my dear.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.719
[door opening]
- Stop!

14:10.762 --> 14:12.590
- What on earth are you doing?!

14:12.634 --> 14:14.679
- I should ask
the same thing, sir!

14:15.506 --> 14:16.986
You're under arrest
for multiple charges of murder!

14:17.030 --> 14:21.208
- What? What?
No! No, no, no.

14:21.251 --> 14:24.080
- Let's go.
- This is outrageous! Let me go!

14:27.214 --> 14:29.433
- There she is!

14:29.477 --> 14:31.914
You slept away
the entire morning.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.394
- My apologies.

14:33.437 --> 14:37.137
- Oh, pish-posh my dear,
pish-posh, and all that.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.661
To sleep,
perchance to dream.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.098
- We've got
your breakfast ready.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.926
- Everything you require.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.102
- This is... This is lovely.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.582
- You need to make sure
you eat right.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.888
Have an extra egg for you.

14:48.931 --> 14:49.932
- Oh, thank you.

14:49.976 --> 14:50.977
- It will bring some of

14:51.020 --> 14:52.021
the colour back to your cheeks.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.023
- We need that.

14:55.285 --> 14:58.071
- Oh! No, no. It's just, well,

14:58.114 --> 15:00.377
this was supposed to be a
surprise for all three of us.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.945
- We're getting
our portraits done!

15:02.989 --> 15:04.642
- Our portraits?

15:04.686 --> 15:07.036
- Three sisters.
This very afternoon.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
- Won't that be so much fun?

15:09.821 --> 15:11.954
- We must all
look our very best.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.174
- I... I see. Of course.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.958
- Uh, my word.
Wait 'til the photographer

15:16.002 --> 15:17.525
gets a look at you.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.701
"Incandescent," he will say.

15:19.744 --> 15:23.052
Positively incandescent!

15:23.879 --> 15:25.446
[grunting]

15:26.534 --> 15:29.058
- God damn it!
Now fuck my mother

15:29.102 --> 15:31.060
and the demon cock
she rode in on!

15:33.758 --> 15:34.934
[mysterious music]

15:37.153 --> 15:39.503
- You have made a grave error,
my friend.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.765
- No!

15:41.766 --> 15:43.768
No!

15:43.812 --> 15:45.857
Sir! You made the error.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.903
An error that will
lead to your grave!

15:47.947 --> 15:50.427
A grave that this entire city
will dance on when the true

15:50.471 --> 15:52.734
depths of your depravity
are revealed!

15:52.777 --> 15:55.824
- I caught him trying
to poison Regina Simcoe.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.608
- Check the concoction yourself.

15:57.652 --> 16:02.309
- I think not. Your guilt is--
- My guilt? Based on what?

16:02.352 --> 16:03.963
What actual evidence
do you possess?

16:13.755 --> 16:16.018
- My detective found
this in your wagon.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.152
The same empty wagon
where your undisturbed bed spoke

16:19.195 --> 16:21.589
volumes about your
whereabouts last night.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.809
- While I'm flattered that you
think I could fit into that,

16:24.853 --> 16:26.594
I was sewing it
for my assistant,

16:26.637 --> 16:29.771
the lovely, lithe Shanika.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.860
We're working The Widow
into our act.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.906
- Very convenient excuse.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.039
- Then where were you last night

16:37.083 --> 16:38.693
when Eddie Jacobs
was being murdered?

16:39.955 --> 16:40.912
- Eddie?

16:40.956 --> 16:43.785
- Ah! Always the performer.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.308
Look at him.
You'd think he didn't know.

16:45.352 --> 16:46.614
- I didn't.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.746
- Where were you?

16:48.790 --> 16:52.185
- I was out impaling someone,
not Eddie, with my own sword.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.231
- Your sword? The Widow
used a sword. When?

16:55.275 --> 16:58.104
- Sir, I believe he's speaking
metaphorically.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.322
- Oh.

17:00.845 --> 17:01.977
You foul-mouthed cocksucker!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.413
Jesus! Sir!
That is uncalled for!

17:03.457 --> 17:05.067
- What is uncalled for
is this fucker not answering

17:05.111 --> 17:05.981
our questions!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.590
Where were
you last night?

17:07.635 --> 17:09.244
Do you even have an alibi?!

17:09.289 --> 17:11.377
- I do. But out
of respect for my...

17:12.117 --> 17:13.467
companion,

17:13.510 --> 17:14.771
I refuse to name names.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.210
You'll just have to take
the word of a gentleman.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.167
- Your word will get you hanged.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.952
- Fuck that impresario.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.258
We've got him right
where we want him,

17:22.301 --> 17:23.954
caught up in his
own web of lies.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.827
- Sir, we should at least
try to find this alibi.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.307
- No!

17:27.349 --> 17:29.091
It's time to tell the whole city

17:29.135 --> 17:30.832
we have got our man.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.357
We've got our man.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.143
[bell ringing]

17:41.321 --> 17:44.454
- Have we perhaps
taken a wrong turn?

17:44.498 --> 17:46.195
This does not look
like a part of town where anyone

17:46.239 --> 17:47.283
respectable would wander.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.850
- Oh, sister, dear,

17:48.893 --> 17:49.807
stop being such a fusspot.

17:49.851 --> 17:50.808
- I'm not. I'm only thinking

17:50.852 --> 17:52.680
about dear, innocent Verdi.

17:52.723 --> 17:53.942
- These streets,
though mean,

17:53.985 --> 17:55.074
are nothing compared

17:55.117 --> 17:56.336
to the tenements
of South Boston where

17:56.379 --> 17:57.989
I would volunteer with the poor.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.209
- Mm. I, for one,
love these little dark corners.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.429
The haunts of artists
and labourers.

18:02.472 --> 18:06.128
You could positively breathe
in the creation unfolding.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.696
- And this artist
we're meeting is?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.567
- Oh, you mustn't be taken
aback by his appearance.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.482
He's a master at his craft.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.832
- A veritable DaVinci,
capable of moulding

18:14.876 --> 18:17.096
the plainest of clay
into a Mona Lisa,

18:17.139 --> 18:19.272
all with the magic
of a camera lens.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.363
[mysterious music]

18:29.020 --> 18:31.936
- Here we are.
Knock, knock, knock!

18:35.418 --> 18:37.507
- We're slightly early.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.074
- Pas de problÃ¨me.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.122
A Botticelli brought to life.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.776
EnchantÃ©.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.040
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.523
- Pleasure is all mine. Come.

18:58.354 --> 18:59.921
[door closing]

19:04.317 --> 19:05.927
- And my day only gets better.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.495
Merlin, shouldn't you be able

19:08.538 --> 19:10.497
to wiggle out of those ropes,

19:10.540 --> 19:13.848
all while pulling a rabbit
out of your murderous ass?

19:13.891 --> 19:16.285
- As I told the good
superintendent,

19:16.329 --> 19:17.678
I am not The Widow.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.854
- Really?

19:19.897 --> 19:21.290
So, explain to me, then,

19:21.334 --> 19:23.292
why these killings only started

19:23.336 --> 19:25.642
after you got back to town?

19:25.686 --> 19:28.210
- Perhaps because the killer
was waiting for us all to gather

19:28.254 --> 19:29.037
in the same city?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
- Mm. What is it,

19:30.604 --> 19:32.040
delayed guilt?

19:32.083 --> 19:34.695
You conjured up a conscience?

19:34.738 --> 19:37.785
- I did not kill our friends.
- Enough.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.483
I arrested you. You're guilty.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.051
- The same way Andrew
May Sr. was guilty?

19:43.704 --> 19:48.056
- You confess, and I will see
to it that when you're hanged,

19:48.099 --> 19:49.579
it's quick and painless.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.758
You don't and you will feel

19:54.802 --> 19:58.284
every last tendon
in your neck snap,

19:58.327 --> 20:02.766
every last drop of piss roll
down your leg as you jerk

20:02.810 --> 20:06.509
and fight trying
to snatch your last breath.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.338
- You won't be alive to.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.558
- Are you threatening me?

20:11.601 --> 20:15.649
- Ugh, I'm stating
a fact. I'm safe in here.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.173
Out there you
and you?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.609
Sitting ducks.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.308
And I can tell you one thing,
Basil,

20:22.351 --> 20:24.440
our cunning friend
The Widow has something

20:24.484 --> 20:25.876
far worse than a little neck

20:25.920 --> 20:27.704
stretching in store
for the two of you.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.838
Kashtinsky arrested
the wrong guy.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.101
He has no actual evidence.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.145
The longer you waste with me,

20:34.624 --> 20:36.017
the more of a chance you give

20:36.060 --> 20:39.977
The Widow to hunt you down.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.457
[uneasy music]

20:41.501 --> 20:43.285
- So you're building
this case on a hunch?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.722
- It's more than a hunch!
He's our man.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.768
- I don't disagree,

20:47.811 --> 20:49.335
but if you're planning on
holding a public trial,

20:49.378 --> 20:51.467
then we need actual evidence
which you don't have.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.947
- Here's evidence.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.209
This was found
in his possession.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.777
- This?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.300
Georges fits into this?

20:58.344 --> 20:59.301
- Not him.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.174
His assistant, Shanika, could.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.699
Perhaps he gives the orders,
she carries them out?

21:05.742 --> 21:07.440
- There's no way some itsy-bitsy
woman could pull off violent

21:07.483 --> 21:08.615
crimes like these.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.964
- I think you need

21:10.007 --> 21:10.834
to give women more credit.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.012
Sir, at least let me
follow this new lead.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.800
- Find her. Arrest her. Bring
her back in for questioning.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.541
- Thank you.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.371
- Get some proof,

21:25.414 --> 21:28.156
real fucking proof,
otherwise Georges is right

21:28.199 --> 21:31.290
and The Widow is planning
her next move as we speak!

21:32.508 --> 21:33.814
[suspenseful music]

21:33.857 --> 21:37.948
[imitating chicken]

21:39.167 --> 21:40.429
[laughing]

21:51.353 --> 21:52.920
- Shh!

21:53.921 --> 21:55.444
Sweet, happy chuck.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.317
Look at all the gleaming
kernels of corn on the ground

21:58.360 --> 21:59.709
in front of you.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.929
Eat them up before
someone else does.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.324
Oh, wait, what's that?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.370
Is that a fox in
the henhouse?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.589
Quick, little chuck,

22:09.632 --> 22:12.069
run to your nest
to protect your baby!

22:12.113 --> 22:13.593
[imitating chicken]

22:13.636 --> 22:15.856
[laughing]

22:19.816 --> 22:21.557
Oh, you weren't fast enough.

22:21.601 --> 22:25.213
That dastardly fox has her
and he's tearing her head off

22:25.256 --> 22:27.215
her fluffy little body.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.479
- Enough!

22:30.523 --> 22:31.741
Enough!

22:33.439 --> 22:35.397
Enough of this cruelty,
I say!

22:36.398 --> 22:37.965
- And if I refuse?

22:39.749 --> 22:41.838
- You'll spend the night
in one of my cells

22:41.882 --> 22:44.145
on a bed made of steel.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.672
- Okay.

22:49.716 --> 22:53.154
My little chuck,
everything is all right.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.203
That wasn't your chick.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.510
That wasn't a chick at all.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.643
And the fox has gone away.

23:03.686 --> 23:06.689
And now, as I count backwards
from three,

23:06.733 --> 23:08.387
you'll wake up.

23:08.778 --> 23:13.435
Three, two, one and...

23:15.568 --> 23:21.312
[laughing]

23:21.356 --> 23:22.923
- Why am I on the floor?

23:28.929 --> 23:31.801
- Come, Miss,
let us find you some air.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.675
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.938
[uneasy music]

23:40.723 --> 23:42.029
[grunting]

23:43.639 --> 23:45.162
- Come on!

23:46.163 --> 23:49.340
[panting]

23:49.384 --> 23:51.430
You stupid, talentless hack.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.528
Here to let me go?

24:21.198 --> 24:23.157
- On the contrary, my friend.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.595
I'm here to get your confession.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.919
[footsteps approaching]

24:47.747 --> 24:49.705
- I don't think there'll
be a show tonight.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.623
- Is Georges okay?
- He's sitting in a cell

24:54.667 --> 24:56.407
for the murder of Eddie Jacobs.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.366
I'm also here to arrest you.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.410
- For what?!

24:59.454 --> 25:01.412
- For helping him.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.936
We found The Widow costume.

25:02.979 --> 25:05.025
It's clearly made for you.

25:05.068 --> 25:08.376
- No. We were adding that
as a new part of our act.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.117
You think I could do something
that horrible?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.773
- Where were you last night?
- Here, setting up.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.602
I ran an errand
for Georges and then asleep

25:16.645 --> 25:17.646
in the wagons out back.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.822
- Georges has an alibi.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.868
Problem is he
won't say who that is,

25:22.303 --> 25:25.567
but if you can identify this
alibi and the alibi holds,

25:25.611 --> 25:27.656
you'll both go free. Otherwise,

25:27.700 --> 25:29.223
you're coming down
to the station.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.233
- Georges is going to kill me.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.498
But I bet I know
who he was with.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.286
- Look at you beautiful ladies!

25:49.330 --> 25:51.027
[shutter clicks]

25:51.071 --> 25:53.508
Superb!

25:53.552 --> 25:54.944
Ah!

25:54.988 --> 25:57.730
Now, let's start
with the individual portraits

25:57.773 --> 26:00.167
starting with... Verdi.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.299
- This is so exciting!

26:03.170 --> 26:05.738
- I've put some fetching outfits
behind the screen for you,

26:05.781 --> 26:06.739
my little rose.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.349
- Wonderful. Thank you.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.961
- Why don't you go back there
and find something you like?

26:16.357 --> 26:17.924
[uneasy music]

26:38.814 --> 26:41.817
[grunting]

26:51.261 --> 26:53.176
- What the fuck are you doing?

26:53.524 --> 26:55.483
- If you don't confess
to The Widow killings

26:55.526 --> 26:57.137
with Shanika as your accomplice,

26:57.485 --> 26:59.661
then you'll spend
the night screaming.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
- I didn't kill anybody!

27:02.098 --> 27:03.665
- That's all you have to say?

27:03.709 --> 27:06.059
- No, no, no, no! You know me!

27:06.102 --> 27:07.669
And Shanika wouldn't hurt a fly.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.323
You've got this all wrong.

27:09.366 --> 27:12.935
No, no, no, please! Kashtinsky!
No, no, no. I swear to you.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.328
I don't know anything
and if I did,

27:14.371 --> 27:16.896
I'd go straight to you.

27:16.939 --> 27:20.551
- And now here you are.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.293
[screaming]

27:36.219 --> 27:37.830
- Sir Andrew May for you,
ma'am.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.573
- Pastor.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.141
I can't tell you the relief
I feel by your visit.

27:46.142 --> 27:49.668
- I just heard they've arrested
someone for Alistair's murder.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.714
I hesitate to say this
wonderful news, but--

27:52.758 --> 27:55.543
- No, no. It is.
It is a glorious day.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.632
But Pastor,
the vengeance I feel?

27:59.242 --> 28:03.899
May the Lord save me.
I... I do... I don't know
what to feel.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.075
My emotions...
- Of course.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.861
- I wish no one any harm,
Pastor,

28:08.904 --> 28:11.124
but the man who did
this to Alistair,

28:11.167 --> 28:15.128
I fear I will celebrate
the day of his hanging.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.479
- Should we sit?

28:23.136 --> 28:25.878
[soft music]

28:27.096 --> 28:31.144
Mrs. Simcoe,
you are a righteous woman.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.364
And the Lord knows this.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.627
And your dark thoughts?
Who amongst us has not had them?

28:37.106 --> 28:41.458
This is what makes us human.
How good is chosen.

28:42.982 --> 28:45.724
- I haven't always chosen
an honourable path.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.162
Pastor...

28:49.205 --> 28:51.164
I've sinned.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.036
- As have we all.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.649
- But I dallied with the Devil
to find out what befell Alistair

28:58.693 --> 29:00.521
that horrible night.

29:00.564 --> 29:03.263
A seance, Pastor.

29:03.306 --> 29:07.920
I participated in the dark arts
and Satan himself used me.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.098
- Well...

29:12.141 --> 29:14.535
who would not want to speak to a
departed love...

29:14.578 --> 29:16.798
Were it possible.

29:17.886 --> 29:21.629
- I don't know how I didn't see
the truth about Alistair.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.285
- Alistair must have known
how wrong some of this was

29:25.328 --> 29:27.678
and he sought to protect you.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.638
All sinners are in torment.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.034
The way through
is faith and prayer.

29:36.426 --> 29:39.255
- Please. Can we pray?

29:39.299 --> 29:41.431
I need to feel
that so desperately.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.920
- Our father in Heaven...

29:51.964 --> 29:53.574
[both]: May his name
be kept holy.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.229
[panting]

30:00.929 --> 30:02.583
- We were friends.

30:02.626 --> 30:05.804
- We weren't. You always looked
down on me with your fancy ways.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.154
- That is entirely
your imagination.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.854
Please, know that when I say
that I don't know anything,

30:12.898 --> 30:14.116
I mean it.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.727
You're making a huge mistake.

30:19.469 --> 30:20.862
- Because we were acquaintances,

30:20.906 --> 30:23.169
I kept everything
below the knee.

30:23.212 --> 30:26.563
And now I'm gonna
start going up your body.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.785
Until you confess.
And you will.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.397
- You're intoxicated
and insane and far more guilty

30:34.441 --> 30:35.442
than I ever was.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.791
- Not from what I remember

30:36.835 --> 30:38.314
of you that night.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.623
- No! No! No! No!
Please!

30:42.666 --> 30:43.798
[screaming]

30:43.842 --> 30:46.670
Help me! Help me! Help me!

30:46.714 --> 30:48.716
- Detective, get off!
That's enough!

30:48.759 --> 30:51.284
- You don't know what you're
doing!

30:51.327 --> 30:52.502
Georges?! He's this close
to cracking.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.330
- Mr. Crenshaw is his alibi.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.679
- A pimp?!
You're going to believe

30:55.723 --> 30:57.029
the lying bullshit of a pimp?!

30:57.072 --> 30:58.987
- Sir, I am.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.946
It was corroborated
by two other witnesses.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.861
- Him and a couple
of his whores, I suppose.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.384
They can all be bought!

31:04.427 --> 31:06.690
- He wasn't with
any of my girls, sir.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.606
He spent the night with me, as
my guest, from dusk till dawn.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.479
- I sleep with men.

31:13.219 --> 31:16.222
- But you've slept with all--
- Men and women.

31:16.265 --> 31:19.007
I'm just not as public
with my assignations with the...

31:19.051 --> 31:20.530
rougher sex.

31:21.792 --> 31:25.187
- Then I'm gonna arrest you
for crimes against nature!

31:25.231 --> 31:27.276
- That's enough!
- Get the fuck off of me!

31:27.320 --> 31:29.148
- Get... get off him!
- Fuck!

31:29.191 --> 31:31.672
- Go! Leave!

31:33.761 --> 31:35.632
- Thank you, my friend.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.246
Thank you.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.682
- Sir, sir.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.249
- What are you doing?!
- Sir, you're clearly

31:43.292 --> 31:44.076
cracking up!

31:44.119 --> 31:45.120
You just broke the law.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.817
- It's within the law.

31:46.861 --> 31:47.949
I've been enforcing
it for decades!

31:47.993 --> 31:49.733
- Sir, you just tortured
an innocent man!

31:49.777 --> 31:50.996
- He's not innocent!

31:51.039 --> 31:53.389
- And you're clearly
high as a kite.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.304
- I assure you,
I've only had a few.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.132
- No, it's scrambling
your brain. You need to go home

31:57.176 --> 31:58.481
and straighten out. Now.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.830
I'll take charge
while you're recovering.

31:59.874 --> 32:00.962
- You'll what?!
- Let's go!

32:01.006 --> 32:02.181
Fine!

32:04.096 --> 32:05.924
[uneasy music]

32:10.450 --> 32:11.842
- Where are my sisters?

32:13.888 --> 32:16.412
- They've given
you some privacy.

32:22.766 --> 32:26.466
You, my dear, are a revelation.

32:28.598 --> 32:35.214
Such a beautiful face
and such sensual curves.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.781
And that dÃ©colletage?

32:37.825 --> 32:39.958
What wonders does it lead to?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.089
[gasping]

32:41.133 --> 32:43.570
Oh. Honey,

32:43.613 --> 32:45.964
I'm not into you that way.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.705
But many men will be.

32:49.315 --> 32:53.972
And that's why
we want to capture you
in full bloom, for posterity.

32:54.798 --> 32:57.236
To remind your future husband

32:57.279 --> 33:00.282
of the beautiful rose
he fell in love with.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.285
- I'm sure this is enough.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.287
- Oh.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.246
That's your
inexperience talking.

33:08.073 --> 33:11.163
Men are insatiable.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.121
There's no such
thing as enough.

33:13.687 --> 33:17.517
Every woman coming
in here is doing the same thing.

33:19.823 --> 33:26.482
Or we can put you
back in that other dress

33:26.526 --> 33:31.792
and your sisters can try
to marry you off to a farmer,

33:31.835 --> 33:35.230
or an elderly widower with

33:35.274 --> 33:39.104
eight children and wooden teeth.

33:41.628 --> 33:45.284
- You're certain these will only
be seen by my future husband?

33:52.160 --> 33:58.862
- A special, secret gift for
the luckiest man in the world.

34:00.299 --> 34:01.909
[chuckling]

34:02.779 --> 34:06.740
- I will support you in any
official complaints or charges

34:06.783 --> 34:08.610
that you'd like to take
up against the constabulary.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.873
- That won't be necessary.

34:10.918 --> 34:15.096
- Sir, you were violated
at the hands of our...

34:15.139 --> 34:17.054
our superintendent.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.101
- Thank you, my dear.

34:21.146 --> 34:24.149
Oh, if I ever have the need
of a mummy for one of my acts,

34:24.192 --> 34:25.976
I'll be sure to call on you.

34:30.458 --> 34:32.331
[door opening]

34:32.373 --> 34:33.940
- Thank you.

34:38.293 --> 34:41.469
- I was violated,
my good detective.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.690
But if word were to get out
about my proclivities,

34:43.733 --> 34:46.649
well, then, I'd be violated
in the public sphere as well,

34:46.693 --> 34:47.694
wouldn't I?

34:47.737 --> 34:49.087
- Fuck 'em.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.784
Fuck 'em all.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.742
Ain't nothing wrong
with who we are.

34:54.614 --> 34:58.139
- So I will accept
this as punishment enough.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.750
And I'm trusting you to keep
my alibi to yourself.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.404
- Of... of course.

35:02.448 --> 35:05.581
- You can rely on him, Georges.
One of the last few good cops

35:05.625 --> 35:06.843
in this town.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.499
- One final thing:

35:10.543 --> 35:13.023
The knots that you used
to tie up Eddie,

35:13.067 --> 35:14.895
they were rather unique.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.592
- Tricks of the trade.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.464
Easily untied if you
know the puzzle.

35:18.507 --> 35:19.943
Nearly impossible if you don't.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.119
- Hm.

35:23.338 --> 35:26.254
- If unique knots are where
you're sniffing, Detective,

35:26.733 --> 35:29.736
half the trades and countries
of the world have their own.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.260
You'll need
to cast a wide net.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.177
Now, if I'm free to go...

35:37.265 --> 35:39.267
My chariot, please?

35:40.834 --> 35:43.663
[groaning]

35:43.706 --> 35:45.839
I'll have to come up
with a magnificent tale

35:45.882 --> 35:49.190
of what's befallen
me before my next show.

35:49.234 --> 35:53.629
Perhaps a roving band
of Crimean cannibals

35:53.673 --> 35:58.112
tried to eat my foot
in retribution for the golden
q

35:58.156 --> 36:01.159
Yak idol I stole from their
holiest of caves?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.857
[chuckling]

36:03.900 --> 36:05.641
[groaning]

36:05.685 --> 36:08.209
- Thank you.
- Okay. All right. Ooh!

36:08.253 --> 36:10.168
That is not good. Oh.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.133
- They're going to
turn out perfectly, trust me.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.657
I mean how could you shoot her?

36:21.701 --> 36:24.312
She's beautiful.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.575
- She looked
a proper little trollop.

36:26.619 --> 36:30.492
- Shh. She looked so good!

36:30.536 --> 36:34.801
- They're going to fetch
us plenty of buyers. A plethora.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.150
I promise you.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.631
- Verdi, be a dear and hurry up
now, will you?

36:41.286 --> 36:43.592
[uneasy music]

36:47.466 --> 36:49.250
- Aren't you going
to take your portraits now?

36:49.294 --> 36:52.122
- No. I'm afraid
that SalomÃ© has more customers.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.081
We'll have
to come back another time.

36:54.124 --> 36:57.563
- I was so taken with how
photogenic you are.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.696
- SalomÃ© says he's never
photographed anyone

37:00.740 --> 37:02.263
quite so beautiful before.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.743
- Never ever.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.356
[chuckling]

37:17.409 --> 37:18.497
- What's all this, then?

37:19.933 --> 37:21.804
- Just a little portraiture
session with the ladies.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.459
- Since when do upper-class
women like the Botticellis

37:24.503 --> 37:25.547
come by here?

37:26.026 --> 37:28.463
- Word of my artistry
has spread.

37:28.507 --> 37:29.464
- Bullshit.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.292
Nothing fucking happens

37:31.336 --> 37:32.293
in my place without my knowing.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.251
You know the rules.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.208
Don't think our friendship

37:34.252 --> 37:35.296
lets you break 'em.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.428
- I promise you I'm never--

37:36.471 --> 37:38.256
- Hold your slippery tongue.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.823
I'll kick you back out
on the streets just as fast

37:40.867 --> 37:42.260
as I saved you from them.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.444
[groaning]

37:52.487 --> 37:54.881
- Fucking bastard!

37:54.924 --> 37:58.014
The young whippersnapper
wants my job!

37:58.058 --> 37:59.494
Fuck him!

38:00.452 --> 38:01.801
[coughing]

38:07.850 --> 38:10.853
[wheezing]

38:35.356 --> 38:36.444
Is it you?

38:39.491 --> 38:41.101
It is...

38:42.145 --> 38:44.322
My love.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.807
Just forget about
those awful people.

38:52.591 --> 38:55.202
I've had to deal
with their kind all my life.

38:56.943 --> 39:01.251
Friendly to my face, but they've
never truly accepted me...

39:01.513 --> 39:02.992
being Jewish,
as I am.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.473
[sighs]

39:05.517 --> 39:07.083
So, I say fuck 'em.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.563
Fuck 'em all.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.178
I can take you away from this.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.442
- You can?

39:19.008 --> 39:21.184
You know of another house
in need of a woman like myself?

39:21.228 --> 39:22.360
- I do.

39:24.623 --> 39:25.667
Mine.

39:28.670 --> 39:32.935
- Sir, I... I mean no disrespect
and I am most appreciative,

39:32.979 --> 39:35.721
but can a chief of police--

39:35.764 --> 39:37.287
- Superintendent.

39:39.899 --> 39:43.903
- A... afford to keep
a maid under his employ?

39:46.079 --> 39:49.735
- No, my lovely Margaret.

39:50.431 --> 39:53.260
What I mean to say is

39:53.303 --> 39:55.393
I can take you
away from this

39:56.002 --> 39:58.134
by making you my wife.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.268
[uneasy music]

40:07.361 --> 40:13.454
- So you save me and in
exchange I get to...

40:13.498 --> 40:17.458
What? Have sex
with you whenever you want?

40:17.502 --> 40:20.461
I get to live out
the rest of my days

40:20.505 --> 40:23.899
in your one-bedroom tenement,
having your babies,

40:23.943 --> 40:26.772
completely at your mercy?

40:28.904 --> 40:32.778
If I'm gonna sell my body,
and I have before,

40:33.518 --> 40:36.434
I'd like to at least make some
money out of the arrangement.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.351
[sighs]

40:41.395 --> 40:43.353
I'd best get back to work.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.841
[suspenseful music]

41:12.731 --> 41:14.167
- Margaret...

41:15.255 --> 41:17.039
I forgive you.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.609
And I know you can forgive me.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.178
[suspenseful music]

41:25.918 --> 41:27.876
No! Please!

41:27.920 --> 41:33.360
Ah! Somebody help!
Somebody help me!

41:33.403 --> 41:35.536
Ah...

41:35.580 --> 41:39.148
Please, let me go.
It was such a long time ago.

41:39.192 --> 41:42.630
I've been a good, upstanding
man since that one little slip.

41:50.116 --> 41:53.032
I shouldn't have
to die for one mistake!

41:53.075 --> 41:55.077
[neighing]

42:08.656 --> 42:11.224
[soft music]

42:14.532 --> 42:16.534
- Are you here to save me?

42:16.969 --> 42:18.623
- I tried to save you.

42:20.102 --> 42:22.844
But you rejected me.

42:25.804 --> 42:28.284
- No... Save me now!

42:29.634 --> 42:31.331
I'll go with you now!

42:40.296 --> 42:41.994
- I'm just here to watch.

42:48.043 --> 42:50.437
[screaming]

42:50.480 --> 42:52.265
[neighing]

42:58.314 --> 43:00.403
Somebody help me!

43:00.447 --> 43:01.491
[neighing]

43:01.753 --> 43:04.016
[screaming]

43:13.155 --> 43:14.983
[neighing]

43:16.681 --> 43:18.030
Subtitling: difuze
