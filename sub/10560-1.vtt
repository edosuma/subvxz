01:17.077 --> 01:18.829
It's 1:00 in the morning.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.873
You never get over that, do you?

01:21.164 --> 01:26.421
Still, damn sight better than the winter.

01:26.712 --> 01:27.804
What do you think, mister?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.135
What do you think's worse,

01:29.423 --> 01:32.347
endless day or never-ending night?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.195
It would depend on your state of mind,

01:34.428 --> 01:35.896
I suppose,

01:36.179 --> 01:39.979
The day, light can consume your thoughts.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.362
The night, thoughts can consume you.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.449
Take the CP rail to Hamilton immediately.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.239
Don't stay on the train any longer,

01:53.530 --> 01:54.577
or they will catch you.

01:54.578 --> 01:57.167
Why are you doing this?

01:57.451 --> 02:01.081
It's one mistake I can set right.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.123
A murderer!

02:11.423 --> 02:13.383
And exactly how long does
your Detective Murdoch

02:13.592 --> 02:15.560
intend to continue his leave of absence?

02:15.844 --> 02:16.845
I don't know.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.185
And you consider George Crabtree

02:19.473 --> 02:20.975
to be an adequate replacement'?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.018
Crabtree's a determined chap.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.233
Yes, and an honest one.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.568
That's quite a rarity for this station.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.984
Detective Murdoch was cleared

02:30.275 --> 02:31.636
of any wrongdoing, Chief Constable.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.778
Oh, yes, of course.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.791
A faulty lock enabled the
escape of both Detective Murdoch

02:37.074 --> 02:39.327
and Constance Gardiner.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.245
That's my report, and I stand by it.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.816
Yes, well, still, nevertheless,

02:43.080 --> 02:44.081
the two of them did make the choice

02:44.373 --> 02:45.795
to walk away from confinement.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.131
Detective Murdoch did so
to apprehend a murderess.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.386
Whom he then proceeded to let go free.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.139
That is merely speculation, sir.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.516
I believe Miss Gardiner
made that choice on her own,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.053
a view also held by both our superiors.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.062
Yes, well, let me remind
you, Inspector Brackenreid,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.814
that I am now your superior,

03:01.098 --> 03:05.274
and I find your recollection
of events to be highly suspect.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.735
Who found the body'?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.995
One of the poor souls
that works in this area,

03:16.279 --> 03:18.077
a lady of the night.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.662
And the victim?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.071
No trace of identification

03:21.243 --> 03:23.541
but quite well-dressed
for this area, I would say.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.251
Likely not a habituate.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.213
Unless he had stolen another man's clothes.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.049
<i>Hmm.</i>

03:31.336 --> 03:33.964
Well, on first impression,

03:34.256 --> 03:35.736
the cause of death seems plain enough.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.346
- Yes, that it does.
- Please, let me through.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.262
I'm Dr. Emily Grace. I'm
with the coroner's office.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.056
- Dr. Grace.
- Dr. Ogden.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.627
We could have met at my office.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.639
There was no need...

03:44.641 --> 03:45.733
I know, and I apologize.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.497
But a fresh corpse and a crime scene...

03:47.519 --> 03:48.736
what more could one ask for'?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.943
No corpse at all, I suppose.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.232
Of course, sir,

03:52.524 --> 03:54.284
but it appears we have
little choice in that,

03:54.359 --> 03:55.155
nor does he.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.196
Ma'am, you can't disrupt
the integrity of the scene.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.830
George, this is Dr. Emily Grace.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.874
She's a new employee
of the coroner's office,

04:00.907 --> 04:01.988
working under my direction.

04:02.159 --> 04:02.955
<i>Ah.</i>

04:03.243 --> 04:05.084
Pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Mister...

04:05.162 --> 04:07.665
Crabtree, George Crab...
Detective George Crabtree.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.004
Well, Acting Detective, I should say.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.795
So let's get to work, Detective,

04:22.888 --> 04:24.811
"Dearest William.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.659
"I have learned of the marriage proposal

04:26.808 --> 04:29.732
"you intended to make to me.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.363
"If your feelings are the same,

04:31.646 --> 04:34.820
you must let me know before I say my vows."

04:40.030 --> 04:43.500
Sir, Julia's wedding...

04:43.784 --> 04:45.161
did she seem happy?

04:45.452 --> 04:48.046
Of course she did.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.709
It was her bloody wedding day.

04:52.000 --> 04:52.842
Now, gel out.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.174
I'll try and put this right.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.730
Hey, fellas.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.148
Come on up.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.944
Looks like you've come along, long way.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.534
Back to see you after a good scrub.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.914
Once you're presentable,
you should pay a visit.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.296
She makes a month on
the creek feel worth it.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.627
She's been to the Far East, that one.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.758
She knows things.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.597
Congratulations.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.188
<i>Almost $200.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:52.694
That's almost half of what I made in a year

05:52.978 --> 05:55.231
back in my old life.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.652
Thank you.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.410
Morning.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.079
I'd like a room, please.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
Your lucky day.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.664
You have your choice.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.550
Oh. My old one, then,

06:15.834 --> 06:17.006
<i>2A.</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:21.673
24 it is.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.093
I wonder if I could have
a word with Mrs. Bryant.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.011
Well, you certainly can.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.424
Will I find her upstairs'!

06:27.637 --> 06:29.264
Hardly. She's at Fort Herchmer.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.604
The Mounties have charged her with murder.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.018
What?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.938
Bashed Kate Linfield's
head in with a pickaxe.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.231
They found Mrs. Bryant ranting and raving,

06:38.523 --> 06:40.742
covered in blood.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.206
I'll be taking breakfast as well.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.993
The bullet entered the right ventricle,

06:50.285 --> 06:51.628
perforated the aorta,

06:51.912 --> 06:53.459
and then lodged in the man's spine.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.126
I imagine death was instantaneous.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.794
From which direction do you think

06:59.085 --> 07:00.712
his assailant approached?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.052
Don't we concentrate on the cause of death

07:03.340 --> 07:04.512
and not the circumstance?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.346
From which direction?

07:06.635 --> 07:08.558
Given the bullet's path,

07:08.845 --> 07:09.966
the person who shot this man

07:10.096 --> 07:11.457
approached him from the right side.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.818
And do you notice anything else unusual?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.862
The man's hands...

07:18.146 --> 07:19.989
they're soft, uncallused.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.820
No dirt under the fingernails.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.530
He's also clean-shaven.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.912
He doesn't seem like
a man who'd live there.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.994
Would I include this in my report?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.407
Sometimes I think it best

07:29.699 --> 07:32.077
to provide our detectives with clues.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.289
They're not always as
thorough as they should be.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.127
Detective Crabtree?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.291
George Crabtree is a fine detective,

07:38.583 --> 07:41.632
but try as he may, he's no William Murdoch.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.329
I'm still something of a novice

07:47.550 --> 07:49.143
in the practice of culinary arts.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.179
It's quite all right.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.519
I left some of my belongings behind.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.935
I wonder if I could have
them sent up to my room.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.603
Do you know where they are?

07:57.894 --> 08:01.023
I left them with Mrs. Bryant.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.566
Then you'll need to ask her.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.325
I can't keep track of everything.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.450
You know, running this
establishment on my own,

08:06.569 --> 08:08.617
it's a full-time operation.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.790
Fort Herchmer, you said?

08:15.078 --> 08:16.375
Mm-hmm.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.638
You're her first visitor.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.650
Mr. Murdoch, a pleasure.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.232
Mrs. Bryant.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.739
I'd invite you in for
tea or something stronger,

08:43.023 --> 08:45.742
but I find myself ill-equipped.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.825
Just to assure you, lam not a murderer.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.245
Do you have any kind
of legal representation?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.876
I'm innocent.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.754
Just the same, it would be wise.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.336
Mr. Harris left for Skagway months ago.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.842
- You're all alone.
- Yes.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.753
But you came to see me for a reason.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.093
How can I help you'?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.350
I'm having trouble locating my valise.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.011
I put it away for safekeeping.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.897
It's under the bed in my room.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.148
Don't worry.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.356
I didn't disturb its contents.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.988
Mr. Murdoch, if there is
any way you can help me,

09:24.272 --> 09:25.194
I would really apprec-

09:25.482 --> 09:28.736
- I really don'! Know how I could.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.199
I'm sorry.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.004
He seems strange.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.540
What drove Mrs. Bryant to such ends?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.801
What drove her was Kate Linfield.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.485
The two hated each other with a fury

09:46.753 --> 09:48.755
that only women can possess.

09:49.047 --> 09:53.769
Elizabeth thought Kate
was stealing her business.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.306
They'd been arguing on and
off for a couple of weeks.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.723
You.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.455
What the devil are you doing in here?

10:00.725 --> 10:02.318
You're not welcome.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.149
You know what I wonder?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.816
Why would a respected
gentleman lay his head here?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.327
I suspect he's getting special favors.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.362
There's not much beneath you, is there?

10:12.654 --> 10:13.871
Stay away from me.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.327
Stay away from me.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.586
Do you hear me?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.214
I do not want to see your face...

10:23.498 --> 10:26.092
Later that evening they
found Kate Linfield dead,

10:26.376 --> 10:29.846
the murder weapon in Mrs. Bryant's hands.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.349
Motive, means, and opportunity.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.179
Excuse me?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.266
When did this happen?

10:37.554 --> 10:38.601
Five days ago.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.890
<i>Isaac McKay saw it with his own eyes.</i>

10:41.182 --> 10:44.436
Have they buried Miss Linfield yet?

10:44.727 --> 10:45.944
Why'?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.903
I wondered if I could examine the body.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.613
You're a bit of an odd duck, aren't you'?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.574
What's your business in this?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.535
I'm acquainted with Mrs. Bryant.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.120
As I was with Kale Linfield.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.808
And I'm more than a little disturbed

11:00.034 --> 11:01.286
by your interest in her corpse.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.172
Noted.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.456
I'll tell you

11:05.748 --> 11:07.591
when this conversation is concluded,

11:25.226 --> 11:26.569
Just making it a fair fight.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.979
Enough!

11:28.271 --> 11:29.693
Stand down, all of you.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.454
The stranger swung first, Sam.

11:38.990 --> 11:43.416
Mr. Murdoch, you've had a change of heart?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.212
- Oh.
- Get in there, Jack.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.716
I see.

12:02.597 --> 12:06.318
You don't look much worse for wear.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.650
Curious how a few questions
could start a bar fight.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.815
It's a tight community.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.030
They don't always take well to outsiders.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.535
Even still,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.322
you were all outsiders
before the gold rush.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.992
Once you become a
sourdough, you form a bond.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.253
You need to make it
through a winter to belong.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.257
You're an educated man, aren't you?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.178
I'm a keen observer of human behavior,

12:34.462 --> 12:36.180
and the manner and type of questions

12:36.464 --> 12:38.432
you were asking in the bar
suggests some form of training,

12:38.716 --> 12:42.186
perhaps a policeman or a lawyer.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.143
Am I right?

12:46.432 --> 12:48.651
I worked for the police force

12:48.935 --> 12:50.562
as a detective.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.777
A detective?

12:54.065 --> 12:56.033
I took you in when you arrived here,

12:56.317 --> 12:58.160
treated you kindly.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.696
Yes. Yes, you did.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.988
I told you I was innocent,
but you won't help me.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.328
Why?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.914
It's not what I do anymore.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.579
So you'd let me rot in here

13:07.870 --> 13:11.716
because you've found a new line of work'!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.049
You two promise to behave yourselves?

13:15.336 --> 13:17.338
Within reason.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.053
Well, you're free to go, then.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.810
You're right.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.437
You're not a policeman.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.564
You're nothing!

13:33.688 --> 13:35.611
So why are you here?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.024
Seeking my fortune,

13:37.317 --> 13:38.569
same as everyone else.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.421
A little late to the party, then, sir.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.492
The gold rush is over.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.952
My claim seems to be panning out.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.368
Then you're the lucky one.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.911
Most people have abandoned their claims,

13:48.202 --> 13:49.545
given up and gone home.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.309
You know, they used to call this place

13:51.331 --> 13:53.129
"the Paris of North America."

13:53.416 --> 13:55.009
Look at ii now:

13:55.293 --> 13:58.513
Nothing but ghosts and desperate men.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.843
Well, I am neither.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.508
Oh, good for you.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.119
Whatever you're searching for,
perhaps you'll find it here,

14:04.218 --> 14:07.438
but I wouldn't hold out much hope,

14:07.722 --> 14:09.099
<i>Hmm.</i>

14:12.268 --> 14:14.236
Sir, the single-shot Eclipse pistol

14:14.520 --> 14:16.160
is a very effective weapon at close range.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.445
Unfortunately, it's also very common,

14:18.733 --> 14:21.202
so we're having some trouble
tracing the ownership.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.658
I am confident, though, sir,

14:22.945 --> 14:25.789
that if I follow the trail of evidence,

14:26.074 --> 14:29.624
then we will, indeed, find the assailant.

14:29.911 --> 14:30.707
What was the name

14:30.995 --> 14:32.042
of the poor bugger that was killed?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.298
Well, actually, I have Higgins
looking into that right now.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.754
On.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.804
- Oh, do you now?
- Well, not right now, sir.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.555
He said he had something
else to attend to first.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.341
Are you taking your
orders from Higgins now?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.055
No.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.016
You are in charge of this
investigation, aren't you'?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.850
- Yes, sir.
- Well, then take the lead.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.266
Get Higgins off his ass
and get him to do something.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.604
Right away, sir.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.145
Higgins, let's get to finding out

14:55.436 --> 14:57.234
the identity of the victim. Hmm?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.522
In a moment, George. I'm
still processing papers.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.236
Higgins, shift it!

15:03.528 --> 15:06.577
See how easy that was, Detective Crabtree?

15:13.496 --> 15:14.793
A detective?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.583
Hook you in.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.887
I'm innocent.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.561
You're right.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.392
You're not a policeman.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.353
You're nothing!

15:46.070 --> 15:48.118
Didn't take you for a swell.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.510
I trust this is enough to
ensure Mrs. Bryant's release.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.968
You are not to leave the area.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.761
I have no intention.

16:10.052 --> 16:14.307
Mr. Murdoch, I hold you
responsible for her actions.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.897
I'm well aware of my obligations.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.185
Now, at your convenience,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.312
I would like to have a closer look

16:19.604 --> 16:21.026
at the murder weapon.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.941
In what capacity'?

16:23.232 --> 16:26.577
I'll be representing Mrs. Bryant.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.239
Well, I'll consider your request.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.532
I'm aware of the North
West Mounted Police's

16:31.824 --> 16:33.201
fine reputation.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.962
I imagine you wouldn't want
to put an innocent woman

16:36.245 --> 16:37.963
at the end of a noose.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.720
Tell me, what was your
association with the deceased?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.382
Mr. Murdoch, can I ask you a question?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.346
Do you believe I murdered Kate?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.074
Please, just tell me what happened.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.436
I need to know.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.599
When you look at me, do you see a killer?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.188
I've seen my share.

16:58.476 --> 17:02.276
And their appearance
seldom betrays their deeds.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.863
What were the circumstances
of your arrest'?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.448
She stole something of mine,

17:08.736 --> 17:10.534
my husband's pocket watch.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.619
He died on the Chilkoot
Pass, never made it here.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.948
That watch was my only
connection that I had to him.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.671
Please, just tell me what happened.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.673
Once Arlen told me she had the watch,

17:20.957 --> 17:22.117
I went straight to her hotel.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.426
That's where I found her.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.678
Your finger marks were
on the murder weapon.

17:26.963 --> 17:27.930
The pickaxe?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.012
I picked it up.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.676
It was lying beside her.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.094
Why'?

17:33.386 --> 17:34.729
I don't know why.

17:35.012 --> 17:39.563
It just seemed filthy beside her.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.773
There was a time when we were good friends.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.065
When I saw her lying there,
that was all I could remember.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.529
And that's when Isaac McKay saw you'?

17:47.817 --> 17:48.864
Holding the weapon.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.619
I tried to explain what had happened,

17:50.903 --> 17:51.984
but I was covered in blood.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.787
Must have looked like a madwoman.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.997
I didn't do it, Mr. Murdoch.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.832
I swear.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.212
Does your detachment come equipped

18:04.500 --> 18:06.343
with any magnifying device,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.174
a microscope, perhaps?

18:08.462 --> 18:11.056
I can't say we have one, no.

18:13.884 --> 18:14.885
May I?

18:20.391 --> 18:22.359
You were a lawman once.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.734
Mr. Steele, please note
that I am taking a sample

18:30.026 --> 18:33.496
of the deposit encrusted
on the edge of the pickaxe.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.952
Duly noted.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.961
Mr. McKay. I hope my questions
won't provoke a reaction

18:44.248 --> 18:45.295
like they did yesterday.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.051
As long as you remain civil.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.088
Why would Mrs. Bryant kill Kate Linfield?

18:50.379 --> 18:51.676
It's no secret Kate Linfield

18:51.964 --> 18:54.342
was slowly driving Mrs.
Bryant out of business.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.604
But that would be a
Pyrrhic victory at best.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.061
From all accounts, the gold rush is over.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.477
There will always be
people pursuing a dream,

19:03.768 --> 19:05.361
no matter how foolhardy.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.989
And they'll need places to stay.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.527
And are you one of those fools, Mr. McKay'?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.458
There's still plenty of money to be made

19:14.487 --> 19:16.831
in mining the miners
for the next few years.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.616
Could you clarify that?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.080
When the rush was on,

19:20.368 --> 19:22.496
that was this city's
largest source of income,

19:22.787 --> 19:25.256
taking gold from the men
who took it from the creeks.

19:25.539 --> 19:29.885
Dance hall girls, $5
haircuts, and $7 steaks...

19:30.169 --> 19:33.139
after a month in the bush,
they were happy to pay.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.264
Thank you.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.552
And you, Mr. Murdoch,

19:38.844 --> 19:41.597
I imagine you'll be leaving soon as well.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.533
And what's that you're doing?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.206
Looking for suspects.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.667
Ah. Among inanimate objects?

20:05.955 --> 20:08.299
Should I be considering you one, then?

20:10.418 --> 20:11.618
If you want to be wrongheaded.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.089
I was in Skagway at the time of the murder.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.757
If you want confirmation,
contact Diamond Lil.

20:16.048 --> 20:16.928
She runs the bordello.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.180
We have a...

20:19.719 --> 20:21.642
Casual friendship.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.930
<i>Ah.</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:26.601
So what are you looking for?

20:26.892 --> 20:30.442
I noticed unusually high
levels of arsenopyrite

20:30.730 --> 20:31.982
in this part of the creek.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.673
The murder weapon was covered in it.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.319
So whoever killed Kate was
familiar with this place.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.578
It's a theory.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.912
Well, this is Hard Luck Thompson's stake.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.040
The stubborn bugger
worked this claim for years

20:44.243 --> 20:46.416
before he went bust.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.832
Any idea where I might
be able to find him'!

20:49.123 --> 20:50.796
I haven't seen him around.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.257
What can you tell me about him?

20:54.545 --> 20:57.970
You can't turn your back
on policing, can you?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.600
Please.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.021
He was once close to Kate.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.397
Once?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.729
Heard they came out here
two years ago together.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.736
She quit him and started at the hotel.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.274
Well, seems my inanimate object

21:14.565 --> 21:17.114
may have uncovered a suspect.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.534
Did you ever see Miss Linfield

21:24.825 --> 21:27.203
in the company of a Hard Luck Thompson?

21:27.495 --> 21:30.499
No, bull heard they were
once very much in love.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.586
<i>Hmm.</i>

21:31.874 --> 21:33.046
In my profession,

21:33.334 --> 21:37.134
I've seen what can happen
when that emotion sours.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.140
Only in your profession?

21:43.093 --> 21:46.393
I, too, have suffered loss.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.024
So that's why you're here.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.363
- George?
- Higgins.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.195
I've discovered the
identity of the dead man.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.032
His name was January Billings. January?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.912
He was reported missing
from his place of work.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.618
A co-worker identified the body.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.328
Has the wife been notified'!

22:05.616 --> 22:06.697
She's here now, actually.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.578
What'! No, Higgins, not right...

22:10.329 --> 22:12.502
Uh, Mrs. Billings.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.963
The constable said that
you wanted to see me.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.925
Yes, please, have a seat.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.931
What is this about?

22:25.219 --> 22:27.597
There's no easy way to tell
you this, Mrs. Billings.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.356
Your husband has been murdered.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.894
Murdered?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.812
No. That... that can'! be.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.198
No, I assure you, he's quite dead.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.693
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.202
It's going to be all right.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.408
All right')

22:43.696 --> 22:44.976
How in heaven's name could it be?

22:45.155 --> 22:47.032
Well, no, "all right" is not the right...

22:47.324 --> 22:48.724
We have arranged for the body to be-

22:48.951 --> 22:50.328
I mean, your husband...

22:50.619 --> 22:51.618
late husband...

22:51.620 --> 22:52.963
I have to go.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.249
Mrs. Billings, if there's
anything I can do...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.168
You can find out who shot him.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.211
That's what you can do.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.768
Shot him?

23:08.137 --> 23:09.639
Thank you for showing me around.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.479
Everyone in town is convinced
Elizabeth Bryant did it.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.689
Hake it you're not.

23:14.977 --> 23:18.982
Circumstance and speculation
will never trump fact.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.116
So what are we looking for out here?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.617
Hard Luck Thompson.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.422
Strange if those two were once together

23:24.695 --> 23:27.118
that he's taken no interest in her murder.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.646
Well, perhaps he didn't care.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.978
Perhaps he's off to another creek,

23:30.034 --> 23:31.434
hoping his luck will finally change.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.870
Possibly.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.631
Thompson!

23:35.915 --> 23:37.417
Mr. Thompson!

23:39.418 --> 23:41.341
Hello!

23:41.629 --> 23:42.425
Hello?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.090
Quiet Quiet.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.016
Ravens.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.023
Nothing but scavengers.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.560
Something around here is dead.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.855
Something or someone.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.457
Over here.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.509
Is this Mr. Thompson, then?

24:20.793 --> 24:26.050
A little worse for wear, but him indeed.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.344
Well, then at least we know it wasn't him

24:29.635 --> 24:31.012
that killed Miss Linfield.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.395
How's that')

24:32.680 --> 24:35.024
Miss Linfield was killed a week ago.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.559
Judging by his condition,

24:36.850 --> 24:39.524
Mr. Thompson has been dead for over two.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.827
There is a silver lining of sorts.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.243
It's possible that the same person

24:53.534 --> 24:55.878
killed Kate Linfield
and Hard Luck Thompson.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.583
Well, why do you say that?

24:57.871 --> 24:59.751
Well, they were both
killed in the same manner

24:59.832 --> 25:01.800
a blow to the head with a miner's pickaxe.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.052
And I found traces of a mineral

25:04.336 --> 25:06.213
both in Hard Luck Thompson's wound

25:06.505 --> 25:09.429
and on the pickaxe that
killed Kate Linfield.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.310
Do you know of anyone
that may have held a grudge

25:11.593 --> 25:13.345
against the two of them?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.230
None, I'm afraid.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.145
Why have you stayed?

25:21.437 --> 25:24.987
We both know the gold rush is over.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.400
This place,

25:26.692 --> 25:28.194
my hotel...

25:28.485 --> 25:30.112
it's all I have.

25:30.404 --> 25:31.576
I fought hard for it.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.866
I do not intend to give it up.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.081
But if there are no customers...

25:36.368 --> 25:37.460
There'll always be some,

25:37.745 --> 25:39.964
enough to get by.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.419
You're still a young woman.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.584
I buried my husband here,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.129
and while I don't fancy joining him,

25:46.420 --> 25:48.548
I'm not ready to leave yet.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.147
Thank you for taking the time lo see me.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.808
You'd never think it,

25:59.099 --> 26:02.524
but there's really so much to
do lo prepare for a funeral.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.563
I don't mean to upset you, but do you know

26:04.855 --> 26:06.323
why a man of your husband's station

26:06.607 --> 26:08.985
would be in such a rough area?

26:09.276 --> 26:13.122
I'm not sure I could guess
what my husband was up to.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.702
We'd grown...

26:14.990 --> 26:18.119
somewhat apart over the years.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.215
Mrs. Billings, something
has been bothering me.

26:23.499 --> 26:26.127
When I told you that your
husband had been killed,

26:26.418 --> 26:27.510
you said he was shot.

26:27.795 --> 26:31.425
How did you know that?

26:31.715 --> 26:34.468
I saw the coroner's report on your desk.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.013
Now, if you'll excuse me...

26:42.184 --> 26:44.482
Yes?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.898
I thought it was over and done with.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.783
No, I'll be there.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.535
Yes.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.576
I'm sorry, but as I said,

26:58.867 --> 27:01.336
I don't know what my
husband was doing down there.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.780
Well, thanks for your time.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.631
And, Detective Crabtree,

27:04.915 --> 27:09.341
I'll have you know, I resent
your veiled accusations.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.474
I thank you for this, sir.

27:17.761 --> 27:21.607
Superintendent Steele
said I was to cooperate.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.188
Tell me, you handle all of
the registered gold claims

27:24.476 --> 27:25.523
in the area, do you not'!

27:25.524 --> 27:26.561
I do.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.656
How many people are
holding on to their claims?

27:28.939 --> 27:29.861
Not many.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.189
So there are very few
active miners at the moment?

27:32.317 --> 27:33.364
That's correct.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.620
You were the luckiest one this week.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.451
Mr. Thompson's claim,

27:37.739 --> 27:39.616
it was active until the lime of his death?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.660
It was, God rest his soul.

27:41.952 --> 27:45.001
Tell me, this other signature
on Hard Luck's claim,

27:45.289 --> 27:46.381
Katherine Thompson...

27:46.665 --> 27:47.461
who is that?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.217
Kate Linfield.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.878
They were once married.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.291
They held the claim jointly,

27:52.546 --> 27:54.514
but she took no interest in it.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.550
So Hard Luck's claim could never be sold

27:56.842 --> 27:59.891
as long as Kate Linfield was still alive'?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.898
Who else still holds
claims on Bonanza Creek?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.934
Isaac McKay.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.071
I believe these constitute
motive for murder.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.481
Hardly.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.902
Without gold, these are worthless.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.118
Isaac McKay tried to buy
Thompson's claims but couldn't

28:18.405 --> 28:21.204
because they were being
held by Kate Linfield.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.292
So you think he murdered
her for the claims.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.627
<i>Yes.</i>

28:24.912 --> 28:26.630
With both Miss Linfield and Thompson dead,

28:26.914 --> 28:28.541
their claims go back on the open market

28:28.832 --> 28:30.334
and into McKay's hands.

28:30.626 --> 28:31.422
Well, I suppose,

28:31.710 --> 28:32.757
but why, Mr. Murdoch'!

28:33.045 --> 28:35.548
The gold rush is over.

28:38.091 --> 28:41.766
Mrs. Billings received a telephone call

28:42.054 --> 28:45.149
about quarter past 5:00 this afternoon.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.355
Higgins, I need you to find that number

28:47.643 --> 28:49.896
from the Toronto telephone exchange.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.940
That way, we can reference the number

28:53.232 --> 28:54.859
against the reverse directory,

28:55.150 --> 28:58.825
and we can ascertain where the call...

28:59.112 --> 28:59.954
the call came from.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.334
Higgins! Phone exchange, now!

29:04.785 --> 29:06.537
I heard McKay tried to buy out.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.468
Thompson's claim at the mouth of the creek

29:08.538 --> 29:10.586
but Hard Luck refused.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.798
Most of these streams are panned out.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.588
Why would McKay want it?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.176
Hope.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.843
For some, being here is
better than the alternative.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.853
Sound familiar?

29:24.137 --> 29:26.731
I'm just trying to make
my own fortune, Jack.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.858
There's no sin in that.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.234
So answer me:

29:30.519 --> 29:32.317
How did a detective like yourself

29:32.604 --> 29:36.074
end up mining for scraps in the Klondike?

29:36.358 --> 29:38.110
I'll never tell a soul.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.621
I made a mistake.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.957
I compromised what I believed in.

29:48.245 --> 29:52.125
Is it a choice that you would make again?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.885
I did what I thought was right.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.638
Would you do it again?

29:58.922 --> 30:01.425
It cost me.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.596
It's our mistakes that define us.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.528
The name of the person
who called Mrs. Billings

30:17.816 --> 30:19.489
is Terrance Novak.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.902
Thank you, Henry.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.743
Bring him in for questioning.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.250
You know, George, we used
to have conversations,

30:26.533 --> 30:28.080
and now all you do is order me around.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.248
That's because I'm your
superior now, Higgins,

30:30.329 --> 30:31.581
so just do what I say.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.091
Certainly, Detective.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.755
Crabtree.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.341
<i>She'?</i>

30:38.628 --> 30:40.346
Your man did a good job for you there.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.383
A little honey with the
vinegar, don't you think?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.454
I've learned from the postmaster

31:04.738 --> 31:06.615
that Mr. McKay has had
a long correspondence

31:06.907 --> 31:08.375
with a California mining concern.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.875
Ah, California!

31:10.160 --> 31:11.082
That's where I'm from.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.411
Fascinating.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.572
The California mining concern

31:13.789 --> 31:16.838
is a Santa Ana dredging company.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.405
Is it becoming clear to you now'?

31:18.668 --> 31:19.948
Well, it's certainly not to me.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.471
McKay's a sly one.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.382
Would you mind telling me
what you're talking about'?

31:23.673 --> 31:25.113
The California gold rush didn't end

31:25.258 --> 31:26.298
when the prospectors left.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.227
It began.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.013
Are you familiar with dredging?

31:29.304 --> 31:30.346
<i>Yes.</i>

31:30.347 --> 31:31.940
Those machines can move more
earth than an army of men.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.022
Yes, but to bring those machines here,

31:34.309 --> 31:35.606
the cost would be enormous.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.737
As would the reward.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.070
But to stage a dredging
operation on the Bonanza...

31:41.358 --> 31:43.736
On the claim once held by Hard Luck.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.119
And Kate Linfield.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.031
So McKay would be the one to profit

31:47.322 --> 31:49.603
if Kate and Hard Luck's claims
went back into circulation.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.327
Suggesting motive, yes.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.619
Bastard.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.431
He killed Kate, and he pinned it on me.

31:54.663 --> 31:58.293
Mrs. Bryant, please. Let me handle this.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.979
Dr. Ogden, do you have
plans for the evening?

32:11.263 --> 32:13.732
If you're free, I would be
delighted if you would join me.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.688
There's a group of women
who meet at a private club

32:15.976 --> 32:17.398
on Church Street.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.030
I have to accompany my husband
to a dinner this evening.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.360
I see.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.491
Well, I hope you can come sometime.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.779
You are something of an inspiration to us.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.493
Well, thank you.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.225
Isaac, you have to tell the truth.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.935
You killed her.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.317
You're the one with blood
on your hands, not me.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.774
Is it because she wouldn't sell to you'?

33:00.061 --> 33:01.341
You're talking madness, woman.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.982
You murdered the two of them!

33:04.274 --> 33:05.696
Elizabeth.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.237
I told you to let me handle this.

33:10.614 --> 33:11.957
Mr. McKay, get out of here.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.244
- I saw what I saw. Sir.
- Go!

33:15.535 --> 33:16.912
I didn't do it.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.581
I'm innocent!

33:18.872 --> 33:21.216
Then trust the law,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.252
not this.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.260
Her name is Constance.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.551
She look the law into her own hands,

33:30.842 --> 33:32.515
and I let her go free...

33:32.802 --> 33:34.600
well, not truly free.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.982
She'll be on the run the rest of her life.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.188
That's better than death.

33:39.476 --> 33:43.151
Perhaps, but what I did was wrong.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.860
If you are innocent,

33:45.148 --> 33:48.493
then you must let the law make
that determination, not me.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.280
That's easy for you to say, Mr. Murdoch.

33:51.571 --> 33:55.292
Your neck's not destined for the noose.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.036
Mrs. Bryant.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.608
I've asked Superintendent Steele

34:00.789 --> 34:02.757
lo return you to custody.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.918
You bastard.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.760
It's in your best interests, Mrs. Bryant.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.368
If you are innocent of this crime,

34:10.465 --> 34:11.512
you will not hang.

34:11.513 --> 34:13.260
You have my word.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.896
You're in an enviable position, Mr. McKay.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.312
The land you need to begin
your dredging operation

34:23.603 --> 34:24.900
is now yours for the taking.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.690
And all it cost was a mere two lives.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.202
Which I had nothing to do with.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.657
<i>Hmm.</i>

34:31.945 --> 34:34.664
Tell me, how is it you had occasion

34:34.947 --> 34:36.541
to be in Miss Linfield's hotel room

34:36.824 --> 34:38.668
at such a convenient time'?

34:38.952 --> 34:40.295
I was worried for her safely.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.799
Are you her sworn protector?

34:44.081 --> 34:46.801
Hardly.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.429
I was in the saloon when Arlen
came in from across the street,

34:50.714 --> 34:54.184
told Elizabeth he'd seen
Kate with her husband's watch.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.471
She ran out of here
faster than a scalded cat.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.766
And you followed her?

35:01.057 --> 35:04.357
No! Right away.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.442
For once, Arlen pulled out the good Scotch.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.073
I'd just had my first sip

35:08.356 --> 35:13.328
when I realized I should make
sure Kale came to no harm.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.365
But you were too late.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.749
Mr. McKay. Who else stands to gain

35:22.037 --> 35:23.960
if you were to go ahead
with your operation?

35:24.247 --> 35:25.089
All of us:

35:25.373 --> 35:28.217
Shops, saloons, hotels.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.468
The best and worst of us

35:29.753 --> 35:31.881
will all profit when the miners return.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.345
Of course.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.814
Mrs. Billings.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.853
On.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.193
I had a conversation with a Mr.
- Terrance Novak.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.402
I believe you know him.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.821
I'm not sure...

35:52.108 --> 35:53.405
The man you hired to kill your husband.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.320
How could you not?

35:55.612 --> 35:56.784
I did no such thing.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.352
That's not what Mr. Novak says.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.255
And you're taking his word against mine?

36:00.492 --> 36:01.618
Why shouldn't I?

36:01.910 --> 36:04.151
Upon searching his premises,
we found several bank drafts

36:04.204 --> 36:07.299
written to him in your
name for services rendered.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.926
How could you do such a thing'?

36:10.210 --> 36:13.635
What did your husband do to deserve this?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.391
All his running around.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.178
At first, it was our secret.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.814
But he became less and less discreet.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.772
All my friends knew.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.936
He disgraced me.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.401
Come with me.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.329
Any luck regarding Mrs. Bryant'?

36:38.613 --> 36:40.866
None, I'm afraid.

36:41.157 --> 36:45.913
May I take a glass of cold water, please?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.172
I imagine you came out
here to prospect as well

36:48.456 --> 36:49.332
hey, Mr. Pike?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.467
Mm, that I did,

36:51.751 --> 36:54.345
but I can't say I had much luck.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.506
You seem to be doing all right now.

36:56.798 --> 37:00.223
I'm not sure I understand.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.103
I was noticing your bar,

37:02.387 --> 37:04.185
all the nicks and grooves.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.940
I imagine you collect your fair share

37:06.224 --> 37:08.602
of stray gold dust.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.942
Oh, I resent the implication.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.860
Oh, it's just another way to
mine the miners, I suppose.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.528
When this town was booming,

37:17.819 --> 37:20.322
this hotel must have done quite well.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.991
Busy every night.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.002
Hmm?

37:26.286 --> 37:29.210
No doubt you're aware of Mr. McKay's plans?

37:29.497 --> 37:33.673
An operation like that would
bring in hundreds of men,

37:33.960 --> 37:38.716
all looking for a place to
stay, blow off some steam,

37:39.007 --> 37:40.600
all of it held in abeyance

37:40.884 --> 37:43.808
by Hard Luck Thompson and
Kate Linfield's refusal

37:44.095 --> 37:47.520
to sell a useless piece of land.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.606
Of course, they're both dead now.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.899
Mr. Pike. Do you have the time?

37:56.191 --> 37:58.740
All this daylight, it's impossible to tell.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.280
It's 11:30 in the evening.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.575
Oh, that is a handsome watch.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.243
May I see it?

38:12.582 --> 38:14.175
Wow.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.587
It's a shame I don'! Have
some of my tools with me.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.801
Otherwise, I'd be able to raise

38:19.088 --> 38:20.761
the inscription here on the back.

38:21.049 --> 38:21.845
You see?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.726
It's been filed off.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.980
That's not necessary.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.982
It was a watch, wasn't it?

38:30.266 --> 38:33.270
The item you told Mrs.,
Bryant Kate Linfield stole.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.485
A man's pocket watch.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.821
You're very clever.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.237
By killing Miss Linfield and
pinning ii on Mrs. Bryant,

38:42.529 --> 38:43.951
you accomplished two things:

38:44.239 --> 38:45.286
You allowed Mr. McKay

38:45.573 --> 38:47.496
to go ahead with his dredging operation

38:47.784 --> 38:49.206
and put yourself in the position

38:49.494 --> 38:52.247
of being the only hotelier in town.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.042
I wish I was that clever.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.552
I was tending bar the
night Elizabeth killed Kate.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.008
No, you weren't,

38:59.295 --> 39:00.968
You were arguing with Kate.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.179
You knew she and Hard Luck were married.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.309
You knew Hard Luck wouldn't sell to McKay,

39:05.593 --> 39:07.470
so you killed him.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.891
You didn't expect his wife
shared the same stubborn streak.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.311
And then no one held claim
to the land McKay needed.

39:14.602 --> 39:15.945
You tell Elizabeth Bryant

39:16.229 --> 39:18.607
that Kate has taken her
dead husband's watch.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.571
She goes to confront her.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.078
You stopped McKay from
following her right away

39:23.361 --> 39:25.989
with a bottle of your best Scotch.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.292
But McKay is a decent man,

39:30.577 --> 39:32.875
and he worried for Miss Linfield's safety.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.960
He wouldn't stay put.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.296
He arrived in time to find Elizabeth Bryant

39:37.584 --> 39:40.633
standing over a dead Kate Linfield.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.390
One hotel owner dead, the
other accused of murder.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.395
Do you own a pickaxe, Mr. Pike?

39:48.678 --> 39:50.100
Lost it.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.312
Oh, then you'll be relieved
to know that it's been found

39:53.600 --> 39:56.103
by Elizabeth Bryant

39:56.394 --> 39:59.773
right beside Kate Linfield's body.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.492
All speculation,

40:02.775 --> 40:05.574
wild theories.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.581
I'll be examining that
pocket watch, Mr. Pike.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.709
And when I do, I believe
I will indeed discover

40:11.993 --> 40:16.089
that it belonged to Mrs.
Bryant's late husband.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.840
What do you think?

40:22.670 --> 40:24.388
Good thing you ended up here.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.425
I owe you my freedom.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.811
But you're leaving, aren't you?

40:30.094 --> 40:32.347
I have business to tend to.

40:32.639 --> 40:33.765
Does ii involve her,

40:34.057 --> 40:36.480
the woman who hurt you?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.770
That part of my life is over.

40:39.062 --> 40:42.737
You'll find another.

40:43.024 --> 40:45.152
Is that what you believe,

40:45.443 --> 40:48.071
one chance at love?

40:48.363 --> 40:52.789
So when my husband died,
it was all over for me?

40:53.076 --> 40:55.499
Please don't tell me that's true.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.210
You'll find someone.

40:58.498 --> 41:02.253
No! Sure I want to.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.467
But if you were compelled lo stay around...

41:10.677 --> 41:13.146
Then that is your loss, Mr. Murdoch.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.352
<i>Shame.</i>

41:15.640 --> 41:17.438
It would have been nice to
have someone to keep me warm

41:17.725 --> 41:18.942
during the coming months.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.282
I don't think I could take the winter.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.067
A softie, are you?

41:26.359 --> 41:30.034
I'll have you know, I have
two under my belt already.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.323
They say the third's the hardest.

41:32.615 --> 41:36.245
Then the spring will be even more glorious.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.336
Good-bye, Mr. Murdoch.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.172
Good-bye, Mrs. Bryant.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.134
How could a woman hire somebody

42:04.188 --> 42:05.440
to kill her husband?

42:05.732 --> 42:07.734
There are many hidden things in a marriage,

42:08.026 --> 42:09.869
especially a dishonest one.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.905
A dishonest one?

42:12.196 --> 42:14.745
Obviously, he had desires
his wife could not meet.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.081
And she was foolish enough lo settle.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.041
The result is inevitable:

42:19.328 --> 42:23.174
The result of a passionless marriage.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.960
You don't agree?

42:25.251 --> 42:27.219
Passion need not be
the bedrock of marriage.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.676
There can be love and mutual respect

42:29.964 --> 42:31.966
without schoolgirl sentiment.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.306
Well, good evening.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.645
- Good evening.
- Doctor.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.613
So what do you think, Detective Crabtree?

42:45.897 --> 42:47.740
You have a keen mind.

42:48.024 --> 42:51.403
Ä°s Dr. Ogden talking about
Mrs. Billings' marriage?

42:56.449 --> 42:58.747
I need to be back where I belong.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.834
I assumed that would be the case.

43:02.121 --> 43:04.965
So you'll need this, then.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.509
I fished it out of the
creek a day or two ago.

43:12.548 --> 43:15.301
I'll wear it once again
once I've earned it.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.312
You saved Mrs. Bryant from the noose.

43:18.596 --> 43:22.021
I suppose that's a start.

43:22.308 --> 43:27.155
You said something about
your mistakes defining you.

43:27.438 --> 43:31.659
I believe it's what you
do to right them that does.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.322
When did I become so philosophical?

43:35.613 --> 43:38.867
Must be the mountain air.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.832
Will you be back?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.248
I don't know.

43:44.539 --> 43:47.088
If I feel the call of the wild once again.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.048
<i>Hmm.</i>

43:49.335 --> 43:51.838
You've been of great assistance to me.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.258
I never did get your surname.

43:54.549 --> 43:57.348
It's London, Jack London.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.353
And what's that you
said, the call of the.â€œ

43:59.637 --> 44:01.514
Call of the wild.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.355
On.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.565
That's a nice turn of phrase.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.131
Higgins.

44:27.415 --> 44:28.962
Hodge.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.297
Good to see you.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.053
Gentlemen, how is everyone?

44:32.336 --> 44:33.633
Worsley.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.264
<i>Winksâ€œ.</i>

44:44.182 --> 44:45.058
Sin.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.817
Oh, you're back. Thank goodness!

44:47.101 --> 44:48.444
It's wonderful to see you, sir.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.823
Ifs good to see you as well, George.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.949
I see you've made the office home.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.110
Oh, sir, I'll have this back
to rights in seconds, sir,

44:56.402 --> 44:57.324
in seconds.

44:57.612 --> 44:58.488
My goodness, sir,

44:58.779 --> 45:00.156
while you were away, we
had the strangest case:

45:00.448 --> 45:02.701
The death of a man
whose name was January...

45:02.992 --> 45:05.273
certainly the first person
I've ever heard with that name.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.413
I had a bit of a mishap
here with your typewriter.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.335
Some of the keys became stuck,
and it drew some blood, but...

45:17.632 --> 45:18.929
You can't do it, Murdoch.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.639
I intend to confess my involvement

45:20.927 --> 45:23.180
in Constance Gardiners escape, sir.

45:23.471 --> 45:24.438
You can't.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.848
It'll ruin me.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.016
You know that

45:27.308 --> 45:28.855
I lied for you.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.817
I'll say it was at my insistence.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.277
And how do you think that'll go down, eh?

45:34.565 --> 45:36.784
Detective Giles is now chief constable.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.070
He already doubts my story
about the faulty lock.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.740
You cast doubt on it, we'll
both end up behind bars.

45:42.031 --> 45:44.284
You're forcing me lo live a lie, sir.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.293
I saved your bloody job!

45:46.577 --> 45:48.418
You made your choice
when you let the woman go.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.707
I made mine when I saved your skin.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.841
The die is cast,

45:54.585 --> 45:57.259
Sir, what will I do?

45:57.546 --> 45:58.746
You want to pay your penance

45:58.923 --> 46:00.971
or whatever it is you Catholic blokes do?

46:01.259 --> 46:03.102
Go back to doing what you do best.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.512
You're a detective.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.147
Be one.

46:10.059 --> 46:11.311
Oh, and, Murdoch,

46:11.602 --> 46:13.400
We'd best watch our backs.

46:13.688 --> 46:16.032
Giles' heady eyes are on us both.
