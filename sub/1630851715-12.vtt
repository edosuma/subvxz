WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:06.354
ANY OTHER DORMICE WANT
TO COME OUT TO PLAY?

00:08.747 --> 00:10.184
HUH!

00:24.894 --> 00:27.027
OH, OH, OH!

00:50.963 --> 00:52.748
HEH HEH HEH.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.059
HELLO, LITTLE FRIEND.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.847
OH, MY GOD!

01:04.890 --> 01:07.763
YOU'RE ALICE!

01:07.806 --> 01:09.547
CORRECTION.

01:09.591 --> 01:12.463
I WAS ALICE.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.785
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

01:36.835 --> 01:39.795
OH, MY GOD.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.405
YOU'RE AWAKE.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.105
HOW AM I HERE?

01:46.715 --> 01:49.152
THE BATTEAM GOT WIND
OF YOUR BREAK-IN,

01:49.196 --> 01:50.588
FOUND YOU UNCONSCIOUS

01:50.632 --> 01:53.243
UNDERNEATH MARQUIS'
POOL TABLE.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.289
BEAT THE GCPD
BY A FEW SECONDS

01:55.332 --> 01:58.596
AND DUMPED YOU HERE.

02:03.384 --> 02:07.823
Y-Y-YOU WERE--
YOU WERE OUT
FOR A FEW HOURS.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.260
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU'D WAKE UP.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.177
OH. ALICE, YOU OK?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.831
ALICE?

02:19.226 --> 02:20.836
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

02:24.318 --> 02:26.668
I FEEL LIKE BETH AGAIN.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.644
WE'VE GATHERED
THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS

02:46.688 --> 02:49.995
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION
OF ELIZABETH MARIE KANE.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.084
THIS IS THE CASE
OF A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD,

02:52.128 --> 02:53.999
WHO AFTER WITNESSING
THE GRISLY DECAPITATION

02:54.043 --> 02:57.002
OF HER MOTHER WAS ABDUCTED
AND HELD AGAINST HER WILL

02:57.046 --> 02:58.526
BY A MADMAN.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.615
AFTER ENDURING 11 YEARS
OF HIS PSYCHOLOGICAL

03:00.658 --> 03:02.834
AND PHYSICAL TORTURE,
BETH ESCAPED,

03:02.878 --> 03:05.968
WHERE SHE EVENTUALLY ENCOUNTERED
A CORRUPT HYPNOTIST,

03:06.011 --> 03:08.188
WHO COMPELLED HER TO FULLY BREAK
FROM HER HUMANITY.

03:08.231 --> 03:12.453
AS A RESULT, MS. KANE
DISASSOCIATED FROM REALITY

03:12.496 --> 03:14.716
TO BECOME A CHARACTER

03:14.759 --> 03:16.370
NAMED ALICE.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.154
WELL, WHEN YOU
PUT IT LIKE THAT.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.547
FOR THE PAST 3 WEEKS,
THE GOTHAM CITY PSYCHOLOGICAL...

03:19.590 --> 03:21.026
IS IT JUST ME,
OR DID THEY MAKE

03:21.070 --> 03:22.245
ALICE SOUND LIKE
A VICTIM?

03:22.289 --> 03:24.552
SHH. I'M LISTENING.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.118
OUR FINDINGS INDICATE
THAT AFTER EXPOSURE

03:26.162 --> 03:29.600
TO A SINGLE ELECTRICAL CHARGE
MS. KANE'S BRAIN

03:29.644 --> 03:31.950
ESSENTIALLY REWIRED ITSELF.

03:31.994 --> 03:35.302
THE AREA THAT HAD BEEN CUT OFF
FROM LOVE AND EMPATHY

03:35.345 --> 03:37.304
HAS BEEN RESTORED.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.351
IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION
TO THE COURT

03:41.395 --> 03:42.700
THAT THE CRIMINAL CHARGES
ARE DROPPED

03:42.744 --> 03:44.833
AND MS. KANE BE RELIEVED
OF HER TRIAL

03:44.876 --> 03:48.837
AS WE CAN NO LONGER DEEM HER
CLINICALLY INSANE.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.708
MS. KANE, WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS MAGICAL BUZZER?

03:50.752 --> 03:54.538
RYAN, RYAN,
I'M SORRY.

03:54.582 --> 03:58.238
APOLOGIES. YOU KNEW
I NEEDED THAT BUZZER
FOR MARQUIS.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.328
YOU KNEW I NEEDED IT
FOR ME.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.547
THE COURT OF PUBLIC
OPINION MAY HAVE CHANGED

04:03.591 --> 04:04.983
THEIR MIND ABOUT YOU,

04:05.027 --> 04:07.377
BUT THAT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE TRUTH.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.295
TAKE IT. MAYBE LUKE
CAN FIGURE OUT

04:12.339 --> 04:13.557
A WAY TO MAKE IT
WORK AGAIN.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.906
IT'S FRIED, ALICE.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.519
IT'S DEAD. YOU WON.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.216
MS. KANE, HOW ARE
YOU FEELING ABOUT TODAY?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.349
- MS. KANE, WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU?
- MS. KANE...

04:26.570 --> 04:30.661
AS MUCH AS I'D CONVINCED
MYSELF YOU WERE DEAD,

04:30.705 --> 04:33.795
YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.276
YOU JUST NEEDED TO BE FOUND.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.585
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A SUCKER

04:41.629 --> 04:43.674
FOR A HAPPY ENDING.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.462
OCEAN?

04:51.465 --> 04:54.816
HOW ARE YOU--
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

04:54.859 --> 04:58.559
YOU MEAN...
BECAUSE I'M DEAD...

05:00.430 --> 05:02.302
BECAUSE OF YOU?

05:04.347 --> 05:07.307
THAT'S THE THING,
ALICE.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.834
I DON'T THINK YOU
DESERVE A HAPPY ENDING.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.793
NO, NO, NO. NO.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.317
WHAT ARE--WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

05:19.101 --> 05:24.454
NO! NO! I'M SORRY.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.849
I'M SORRY.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.155
I'M SORRY.

05:30.199 --> 05:33.202
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.683
I'M SORRY.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.859
I'M S...

06:00.229 --> 06:02.144
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.022
WHERE IS IT?

06:34.742 --> 06:37.440
LEAVE ME ALONE!

06:37.484 --> 06:40.530
LEAVE ME ALONE!
GET AWAY FROM ME, ALICE!

06:40.574 --> 06:42.445
GET AWAY!

06:56.154 --> 06:57.808
OH! WHAT THE?

06:57.852 --> 07:00.071
SOMEBODY, HEL--AAH!

07:04.554 --> 07:07.470
HOLY CRAP!
YOU'RE BATWOMAN.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.342
AND YOU'RE MARQUIS JET'S
LOYAL NUMBER TWO--

07:10.386 --> 07:12.301
IN EVERY MORNING
BEFORE SUNRISE,

07:12.344 --> 07:13.955
NEVER TAKES A SICK DAY,

07:13.998 --> 07:15.522
KEEPER OF MARQUIS'
SCHEDULE,

07:15.565 --> 07:18.786
AND--SHALL I PRESUME--
HIS SECRETS.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.185
HEH.

07:32.843 --> 07:36.238
HEH HEH.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.545
HEY.

07:38.588 --> 07:42.200
SO. IF YOU LEAVE ME
ALONE IN BED,

07:42.244 --> 07:45.290
YOU BETTER HAVE COFFEE.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.510
OH!

07:47.554 --> 07:49.469
CREAM AND SUGAR,
DEAR?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.740
ALICE? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

07:59.783 --> 08:01.785
I HAVE PATIENTS
COMING IN.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.961
- ALICE!
- WHERE'S THE...

08:04.005 --> 08:06.050
HALOPERIDOL,
THE...CHLORPROMAZINE?

08:06.094 --> 08:07.791
THE--THE ANTIPSYCHOTICS,
MAR-BEAR?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.533
- COUGH THEM UP!
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEAVING!

08:10.577 --> 08:12.230
I PACKED YOU A BAG!

08:12.274 --> 08:14.058
I GAVE YOU ENOUGH CASH
TO GET HALFWAY

08:14.102 --> 08:15.843
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.540
ALICE, THERE'S AN APB
ON YOUR HEAD!

08:17.584 --> 08:19.107
YOU CAN'T BE HERE!

08:19.150 --> 08:21.370
I AM LOSING MY MIND!

08:21.413 --> 08:25.461
I'M--I'M LOSING MY MIND.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.509
THE--THE HALLUCINATIONS
ARE BACK BUT WORSE,

08:29.552 --> 08:31.206
AND I--I JUST NEED
A LITTLE EDGER

08:31.249 --> 08:33.251
UNTIL YOU CAN GET
ME THE JOY BUZZER.

08:33.295 --> 08:36.646
BUT KIKI, SHE SAID
THAT THERE WAS ONLY
ONE BUZZ LEFT.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.519
EXACTLY, SO WHY ARE WE
STILL STANDING HERE?

08:39.562 --> 08:44.524
BECAUSE RYAN NEEDS IT
FOR HER BROTHER.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.004
BUT YOU NEED IT
FOR YOU SISTER.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.137
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT
MY SISTER.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.144
WHY DIDN'T YOU
STOP ME?

08:56.187 --> 08:58.668
A REAL SISTER
WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME

08:58.712 --> 09:01.628
BEFORE I KILLED SOMEONE.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.371
YOU THINK THIS IS
MY FAULT?

09:06.415 --> 09:09.592
THAT WAS ALL YOU...

09:09.636 --> 09:11.202
POISON MARY.

09:11.246 --> 09:14.466
I WAS THERE FOR YOU,
MAKING SURE NO ONE

09:14.510 --> 09:15.642
GOT IN YOUR WAY.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.034
YOU WEREN'T THERE FOR ME.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.646
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.605
YOU NEEDED ME,
SO YOU ENCOURAGED ME,

09:22.649 --> 09:24.738
AND--AND NOW A WIFE
IS WITHOUT HER HUSBAND

09:24.781 --> 09:26.783
AND THEIR TWO BOYS
WITHOUT THEIR DAD,

09:26.827 --> 09:29.917
AND THEIR LIFE IS RUINED,
AND MY LIFE IS RUINED!

09:31.483 --> 09:35.705
GOT IT.
I AM SO SORRY

09:35.749 --> 09:39.143
THAT YOU GUTTED A MAN
WITH A TREE BRANCH.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.971
MY BAD!

09:41.015 --> 09:43.974
WOULD YOU JUST GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

09:54.811 --> 09:56.726
WHAT IS THIS,
"GILMORE GIRLS"?

09:56.770 --> 10:00.556
RYAN AND I HAVE SOME
FAMILY MATTERS TO DISCUSS.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.603
YOU MEAN, YOU NEED
HER PROTECTION
FROM MARQUIS.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.343
NOW THAT THE EVIDENCE
OF HIM KILLING
HIS FATHER

10:05.387 --> 10:07.607
HAS BEEN DESTROYED,
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

10:07.650 --> 10:08.912
TO HOLD OVER HIS HEAD.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.348
RYAN'S LIFE IS
COMPLICATED ENOUGH

10:10.392 --> 10:14.396
WITHOUT YOU PLAYING
MOM ALL OF A SUDDEN.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.704
THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
PLAYING HERE IS MARQUIS,

10:17.747 --> 10:19.923
AND IF WE DON'T GET
OUR HANDS ON THAT JOY BUZZER

10:19.967 --> 10:21.664
AND USE IT ON HIM SOON,

10:21.708 --> 10:23.971
ALL OF GOTHAM CITY
COULD BECOME HIS SANDBOX.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.712
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IF YOU HAD TREATED HIM

10:25.755 --> 10:28.279
LIKE A CRIMINAL
AND NOT YOUR
PRECIOUS BABY BOY

10:28.323 --> 10:30.934
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS SITUATION
TO BEGIN WITH.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.719
- MMM, MMM.
- DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU--

10:32.762 --> 10:35.286
TELL ME THAT IS NOT
VEGAN PUFF PASTRY.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.465
HEY. YOU COULD HAVE WARNED ME
YOUR MOM WAS COMING OVER.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.729
AT LEAST WHEN I LIVED
WITH ALICE, SHE KNOCKED.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.340
YOUR MAMA ALMOST
SAW ME NAKED.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.692
I AM SORRY. I--I SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.433
SHE WANTED TO HUDDLE
SO WE CAN GAME PLAN A WAY

10:51.476 --> 10:53.000
TO STOP MARQUIS.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.354
THIS IS MARQUIS'
CALENDAR.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.095
STEP ONE--WE CAN
GET A SENSE OF HIS DAY,

11:01.138 --> 11:04.359
SO STEP TWO--WE CAN
AMBUSH HIS ASS.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.666
- HUH?
- WHAT'S WRONG?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.711
THERE'S NOTHING
ON HIS SCHEDULE.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.973
YEAH, BUT LOOK
AT TOMORROW

11:10.017 --> 11:11.801
AND EVERY DAY
LAST WEEK.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.760
HE'S BOOKED SOLID
9 TO 6--

11:13.803 --> 11:16.284
MEETINGS, LUNCHES,
CALLS, DRINKS.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.807
IS THERE SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT TODAY?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.417
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.117
OK. HOLD ON.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.684
WAIT.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.424
- WHO'S BARBARA KEAN?
- WHY?

11:26.468 --> 11:28.339
HE E-MAILED MILES
ASKING HIM TO FIND

11:28.383 --> 11:29.863
HER HOME ADDRESS.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.739
OK. BARBARA KEAN IS
THE OWNER OF AN ART GALLERY

11:36.783 --> 11:39.699
IN THE BOWERY
AND JIM GORDON'S EX-WIFE.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.265
AS IN COMMISSIONER
GORDON?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.832
YEAH. APPARENTLY,
THEY USED TO DINE

11:42.876 --> 11:44.704
WITH GOTHAM'S UPPER CRUST
BUT DIVORCED

11:44.747 --> 11:46.662
AFTER THEIR SON J.J.
WAS FOUND

11:46.706 --> 11:49.447
WITH BODY PARTS
IN HIS CLOSET.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.754
BARBARA'S REPUTATION
NEVER RECOVERED.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.104
PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.280
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY LATE
FOR MY 8:00,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.413
SO I'LL GET GOING.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.458
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED
TO FINDING MARQUIS?

12:00.502 --> 12:02.199
WELL, I WILL KEEP
AN EAR TO THE GROUND,

12:02.243 --> 12:04.288
AND YOU'LL DO THE SAME,
AND WHATEVER YOU NEED,

12:04.332 --> 12:07.727
UH, RESOURCES, MONEY,
MANPOWER,

12:07.770 --> 12:09.859
YOU GOT IT, IT'S YOURS.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.735
THAT WAS WEIRD, RIGHT?

12:16.910 --> 12:19.347
- WHAT?
- STAY HERE.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.654
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.178
JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.792
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE KNOWS
OR WHAT HE'S DOING,

12:29.836 --> 12:32.229
BUT IF IT INVOLVES BARBARA,
IT COULD VERY WELL INVOLVE

12:32.273 --> 12:35.102
YOU, ME, MARIO, ALL OF US.

12:35.145 --> 12:38.583
LET YOUR SECURITY TEAMS KNOW
WE'RE NOT SAFE.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.804
FROM WHOM? BGS?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.414
HOW'D YOU GET DOWN HERE
SO FAST?

12:43.458 --> 12:46.896
IT'S A LESBIAN BAR.
KNOW YOUR EXITS.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.811
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
RYAN THAT BARBARA KEAN

12:48.855 --> 12:50.291
IS PART OF THE BLACK
GLOVE SOCIETY?

12:50.334 --> 12:52.249
THIS DOESN'T NEED TO
INVOLVE RYAN.

12:52.293 --> 12:55.470
AHH. WORRIED HER
KNOWING YOU'RE
STILL AFFILIATED

12:55.513 --> 12:57.037
WITH A MURDEROUS CABAL
MIGHT SCREW UP

12:57.080 --> 12:58.908
MOTHER-DAUGHTER
BONDING TIME?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.605
DESPITE APPEARANCES,
SOPHIE,

13:00.649 --> 13:02.477
I'M TRYING TO DO
WHAT'S RIGHT.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.740
NOW EXCUSE ME
BEFORE PEOPLE GET HURT.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.394
RYAN WANTS TO TRUST YOU.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.743
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GIVING
HER A CHANCE.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.136
IF YOU CARE ABOUT RYAN,

13:09.179 --> 13:10.920
YOU'LL KEEP THIS
TO YOURSELF.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.850
HI. CAN I ASK YOU
WHO YOU'RE HERE
TO PICK UP?

13:27.894 --> 13:30.592
WHO ARE YOU?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.159
IS IT JADA JET?

13:32.202 --> 13:33.856
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THAT?

13:33.900 --> 13:36.598
CALL 911. YOUR BOSS WAS
JUST KIDNAPPED!

13:42.647 --> 13:44.432
OH, MY GOD!

13:49.916 --> 13:52.179
- HI.
- CAN I HELP YOU?

13:52.222 --> 13:56.487
UM...IS YOUR MOM HOME?

13:56.531 --> 13:58.141
MOM, DOOR!

13:58.185 --> 14:01.449
NOAH, YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE UP YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.147
SORRY. IF YOU'RE HERE
TO SELL SOMETHING,
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.758
OH, NO. I'M NOT
SELLING ANYTHING.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.239
I'M MARY HAMILTON.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.546
I'M SORRY TO STOP
BY UNANNOUNCED

14:11.589 --> 14:14.854
WHEN YOUR FAMILY'S
GOING THROUGH SUCH
A DIFFICULT TIME.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.291
YES?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.554
I BELIEVE I HAVE
INFORMATION PERTAINING

14:19.597 --> 14:21.556
TO YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.865
UH...

14:25.908 --> 14:27.431
COME IN.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.185
UH-OH.

14:42.229 --> 14:46.276
LOOK WHO'S LOSING
HER GRIP...

14:46.320 --> 14:50.890
FIGURATIVELY
AND LITERALLY.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.588
HEH HEH. MY SWEET MOUSE.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.896
NO.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.379
DID YOU THINK
THIS WAS OVER?

15:02.423 --> 15:06.862
I...AM NOT
LISTENING TO YOU.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.690
YOU'RE NOT HERE,

15:08.733 --> 15:10.344
AND YOU'RE NOT REAL.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.737
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE,

15:12.781 --> 15:16.002
TRYING TO GET
YOURSELF A LITTLE
JOY BUZZER,

15:16.045 --> 15:18.308
AN UNDO SWITCH?

15:18.352 --> 15:21.877
WOULDN'T THAT BE
NICE?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.707
GET...OUT
OF MY HEAD!

15:33.976 --> 15:35.456
UNH!

15:37.501 --> 15:40.635
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
YOU'D SEEN THE LAST
OF ME, DID YOU?

15:41.723 --> 15:44.421
OK. WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS
BLACK ROLLS-ROYCE

15:44.465 --> 15:45.857
WITH CRANBERRY
LEATHER INTERIOR

15:45.901 --> 15:47.903
ARE RARE EVEN
FOR RICH PEOPLE.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.600
THIS WAS TARGETED.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.689
HOW ELSE WOULD SOMEONE
KNOW THE IDENTICAL MAKE

15:51.733 --> 15:53.517
AND MODEL OF JADA'S CAR?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.217
SPEAKING OF IDENTICAL,

15:57.260 --> 16:00.176
WEREN'T YOU WEARING
THAT YESTERDAY?

16:00.220 --> 16:03.571
OH. UM...
ACTUALLY, I--

16:03.614 --> 16:06.095
HELPED ME TRACK DOWN
MARQUIS' ASSISTANT ALL NIGHT.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.010
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO GO HOME.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.404
OH. OH, OK.
GOT A HIT.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.841
PARTIAL PLATE BELONGS
TO A CAR PURCHASED

16:12.884 --> 16:14.886
TWO DAYS AGO
BY WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.280
MARQUIS. HE MADE
HIS MOVE.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT I THINK THIS

16:19.065 --> 16:20.283
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH BARBARA KEAN

16:20.327 --> 16:21.545
AND THE BLACK GLOVE
SOCIETY.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.112
EXPLAIN IT TO ME
ON THE ROAD.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.853
LUKE, GIVE ME
A TRACE ON THAT CAR.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.942
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE
THE HELL HE'S TAKING HER ASAP.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.770
ON IT.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.642
MAKE ME A JOY BUZZER!

16:31.686 --> 16:33.601
THIS CAN BE AN EXCITING
TALE TO TELL THE GRANDKIDS

16:33.644 --> 16:34.819
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.126
HA HA HA! NICE TRY,

16:37.170 --> 16:38.998
BUT NOTHING BEATS
THE ONE ABOUT THE TIME

16:39.041 --> 16:42.305
I HELPED THE JOKER
BEAT ROBIN TO DEATH
WITH A CROWBAR.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.786
HOLIDAY FAMILY
CLASSIC.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.010
SEE, THE THING IS,
SWEETIE,

16:51.053 --> 16:52.750
I ONLY HAVE
THE PATIENCE TO WORK

16:52.794 --> 16:55.318
FOR ONE PSYCHOPATH,
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

16:55.362 --> 17:01.063
MARQUIS JET SIGNS
MY W-2s. HA HA HA!

17:01.107 --> 17:03.109
AGH!

17:03.152 --> 17:05.589
A LITTLE TIP ABOUT
MANAGING PSYCHOPATHS.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.200
IT'S BEST TO APPEASE
THE ONE WHO HAS

17:07.243 --> 17:08.549
THE KNIFE AT YOUR
THROAT.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.724
HEH HEH.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.336
I'VE WORKED FOR THE JOKER
SINCE I WAS 16.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.905
YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE FIRST CRAZY BLOND WOMAN

17:16.948 --> 17:18.863
I'VE EVER DEALT WITH?
HA HA!

17:25.914 --> 17:27.394
SORRY ABOUT THAT. HEH.

17:27.437 --> 17:30.223
WAY TOO MANY CRAZY PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.880
UGH. OF COURSE,
IT'S IN HER POCKET.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.927
SHE WAS MAKING SOME
LAST-MINUTE TWEAKS FOR ME.

17:38.970 --> 17:42.322
ALICE OF FREAKING
WONDERLAND.

17:42.365 --> 17:46.195
MAY I JUST SAY IT IS
AN HONOR.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.371
MARQUIS JET,
I PRESUME.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.374
IN THE FLESH.
DON'T STEAL IT.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.462
HA HA.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.377
SO, ALICE
OF FREAKING WONDERLAND,

17:54.421 --> 17:56.075
WHAT--WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY WANT

17:56.118 --> 17:57.815
WITH MY JOY BUZZER?

17:57.859 --> 18:00.905
HERE'S THE THING.
THAT HAS ONE MORE
BUZZ IN IT,

18:00.949 --> 18:04.170
AND IF YOU PLAY
YOUR RAZOR-SHARP
CARDS RIGHT,

18:04.213 --> 18:06.259
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE USED ON YOU.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.043
OH, PRETTY PLEASE
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

18:08.087 --> 18:09.305
USE IT ON YOURSELF.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.611
I MEAN, YOU'RE A LEGEND.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.482
YOU'RE THE MENACE
OF GOTHAM,

18:12.526 --> 18:14.223
THE RINGLEADER OF RABBITS,

18:14.267 --> 18:17.139
THE QUEEN
OF HEARTLESSNESS.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.360
LIKE YOU SAID,
TOO MANY CRAZIES,
TOO SMALL A SPACE.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.189
- NOW GIVE ME--
- AH, AH, OH!

18:23.232 --> 18:25.104
NOW THE THING IS, ALICE,
YOU KNOW,

18:25.147 --> 18:28.759
I MIGHT BE NEW
TO THIS WHOLE--THE WORLD
OF PUBLIC PSYCHOS,

18:28.803 --> 18:31.153
BUT I'M NOT ABOUT
TO START MY REIGN

18:31.197 --> 18:34.896
BY LOSING ONE
OF THE LEGENDS.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.202
HA HA HA!

18:36.245 --> 18:37.681
LET'S SEE IF I CAN'T
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.422
HA HA HA!

18:40.989 --> 18:42.295
HA HA! HA HA HA!

18:42.338 --> 18:45.602
HA HA HA HA!

18:45.646 --> 18:48.127
HA HA HA!

19:06.667 --> 19:09.583
WHAT IN THE CULT FROM HELL?

19:09.626 --> 19:12.847
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY,

19:12.890 --> 19:16.459
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME
THIS EVENING.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.418
NOW IN HONOR OF TRADITION,

19:18.461 --> 19:21.725
LET US COMMENCE
WITH ROLL CALL.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.814
BARBARA KEAN?

19:23.858 --> 19:25.947
- HERE.
- OHH!

19:25.990 --> 19:28.819
THEN WE HAVE BURTON CROWNE.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.822
NICE 'STACHE, BRO.

19:31.866 --> 19:37.306
NEXT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST
PROFITEERS OF CRAZY,

19:37.350 --> 19:39.830
MR. JEREMIAH ARKHAM HIMSELF.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.705
MARIO FALCONE, WELCOME.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.970
AND LAST
BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST,

19:49.013 --> 19:53.844
THE LADY WHO IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS FINE EVENING--

19:53.888 --> 19:55.716
MS. JADA JET.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.503
NOW ALLOW ME TO WELCOME YOU
TO THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY'S

20:00.547 --> 20:02.853
FINAL CEREMONY.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.899
GO ON. LOOK AROUND.

20:04.942 --> 20:08.250
THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT
AND THE PERSON TO YOUR LEFT

20:08.294 --> 20:09.599
ARE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.691
WE HAVING FUN YET?

20:20.958 --> 20:23.744
SO AS I'VE RECENTLY
COME TO DISCOVER,

20:23.787 --> 20:26.007
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY
WAS FOUNDED

20:26.050 --> 20:28.879
BY MARLA ELLIOT IN 1984.

20:28.923 --> 20:32.056
HER SON TOMMY HAD
THIS DEEPLY CREEPY NEED

20:32.100 --> 20:34.885
TO BE JUST LIKE
HIS BESTIE BRUCE WAYNE.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.018
EVEN WANTED TO BE
AN ORPHAN LIKE BRUCE,

20:37.061 --> 20:41.544
WHICH MEANT HE WENT AT MOMMY
WITH HER SEWING SCISSORS. OOF.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.939
"UH-OH!" SAID MARLA ELLIOT,

20:44.982 --> 20:49.073
HIDING HER STAB WOUNDS
BEHIND HER PLASTIC SURGERY.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.902
"I'M GOTHAM'S HIGH SOCIETY.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.340
I CAN'T HAVE A FREAK SHOW
FOR A SON."

20:55.645 --> 20:58.213
"WHAT IF SOMEBODY
STOPS INVITING ME

20:58.257 --> 21:01.216
"TO LUNCHES AT THE POLO CLUB?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.871
GUESS WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?"

21:07.788 --> 21:10.269
AND THUS...

21:10.312 --> 21:13.533
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY
WAS BORN.

21:13.576 --> 21:16.884
AM I GETTING THIS RIGHT SO FAR?

21:16.927 --> 21:19.365
NOD IF I'M CLOSE.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.931
GOOD.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.768
BARBARA KEAN,

21:31.812 --> 21:34.684
NOW YOU'RE THE MOTHER
OF J.J. GORDON, RIGHT?

21:34.728 --> 21:37.034
IF I'M REMEMBERING
THIS CORRECTLY,

21:37.078 --> 21:40.473
WHEN J.J. WAS 15,
HE TIED A LABRADOODLE

21:40.516 --> 21:42.562
TO TRAIN TRACKS?

21:42.605 --> 21:44.999
AH. THAT'S, UH--
THAT'S ROUGH, YOU KNOW,

21:45.042 --> 21:47.175
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU RUN

21:47.218 --> 21:50.134
FOR PHILANTHROPIC CHAIR,
AND SOMEBODY'S LIKE,

21:50.178 --> 21:53.964
"HEY. DIDN'T YOUR KID MURDER
A FREAKING LABRADOODLE?"

21:54.008 --> 21:57.620
SO TO HIDE
AN UNSIGHTLY SCENE,

21:57.664 --> 22:01.276
YOU HIRED SOME OFF-THE-BOOKS
DOCTORS TO FILL J.J.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.322
WITH EXPERIMENTAL MEDICATION

22:03.365 --> 22:05.062
SO YOU COULD TRY
TO FIX HIM.

22:05.106 --> 22:09.763
PROBLEM IS--SHOCKER--
IT DIDN'T WORK.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.853
NOW HE'S JUST A DROOLING HUSK
AT ARKHAM.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.640
JADA, WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING?

22:17.684 --> 22:19.555
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING,
PLEASE!

22:19.599 --> 22:22.341
OH, COME ON.
DON'T FIGHT IT, BABS.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.474
I MEAN, YOU DID USE THIS
ON YOUR OWN SON,

22:25.518 --> 22:29.391
SO HOW DANGEROUS
COULD IT BE, RIGHT?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.741
7 CLINICAL TRIALS IN ALL.

22:31.785 --> 22:35.136
THIS DOSE CONTAINS
EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT

22:35.179 --> 22:38.008
OF EVERY SINGLE MEDICINE
YOU'VE GIVEN HIM.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.407
I'M SORRY.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.722
SAY HI TO MARLA
FOR US, WOULD YOU?

23:00.988 --> 23:02.729
WHO'S NEXT?

23:03.947 --> 23:06.385
YOU KNOW, I BET YOU
HE'D LET YOU KILL
A FEW OF THEM.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.516
MARIO FALCONE.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.736
HE SEEMS TO
REALLY LIKE YOU.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.521
- I'M GOOD, THANKS.
- YOU SURE?

23:12.565 --> 23:16.307
ISN'T THIS SORT
OF THING KIND OF LIKE
YOUR SUPER BOWL?

23:16.351 --> 23:18.919
REVENGE, FLAIR,

23:18.962 --> 23:22.531
A FUN, LITTLE WHEEL
TO MAKE IT A GAME.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.967
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

23:24.011 --> 23:27.754
THE JOY BUZZER,
ALICE.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.148
YOU DON'T
DESERVE THAT.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.541
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.718
SEE...THAT'S CONFUSING

23:35.762 --> 23:39.766
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A FIGMENT OF MY DELIRIUM,

23:39.809 --> 23:41.898
AND I KNOW IN MY BONES

23:41.942 --> 23:45.554
THAT I NOT ONLY DESERVE IT,
I NEED IT,

23:45.598 --> 23:47.991
SO BE GONE, SWEET MOUSE.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.559
YOUR LOGIC DOESN'T FIT
INTO MY WORKING NARRATIVE.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.692
YOU POISONED ME.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.958
AT OUR TEA PARTY.

23:58.001 --> 24:01.222
YOU TAPED A LIVE RAT
TO MY CHEST

24:01.265 --> 24:03.920
TO LURE BATS
TO MY FLESH.

24:05.879 --> 24:09.099
MY BLOOD.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.493
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID...

24:11.537 --> 24:13.452
TO YOUR BEST FRIEND.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.586
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
JUST WALK AWAY FROM THAT,

24:17.630 --> 24:22.112
ERASE IT, MOVE ON?

24:22.156 --> 24:24.550
GET AWAY FROM ME!

24:30.686 --> 24:33.341
SO YOU SAID
YOU HAD INFORMATION

24:33.384 --> 24:34.995
ABOUT MY HUSBAND'S MURDER?

24:35.038 --> 24:38.433
RIGHT. AHEM.

24:38.477 --> 24:44.526
SO...THIS IS
DIFFICULT,

24:44.570 --> 24:49.575
BUT...I KNOW YOUR
HUSBAND'S KILLER.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.143
UM, SO DO WE.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.232
YOU DO?

24:55.276 --> 24:57.626
UH...

24:57.670 --> 25:00.020
IT'S VERY BRAVE OF YOU,
MARY,

25:00.063 --> 25:01.761
TO COME HERE,

25:01.804 --> 25:05.329
CONSIDERING YOUR STEPSISTER
TOOK HIS LIFE.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.941
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

25:07.984 --> 25:10.987
I FIGURED THAT'S
WHY YOU CAME HERE.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.946
YESTERDAY, THE POLICE
INFORMED US

25:12.989 --> 25:14.687
THEY RECEIVED A CALL
FROM A WOMAN

25:14.730 --> 25:17.037
CLAIMING TO BE ALICE.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.126
SHE OWNED UP
TO THE MURDER.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.215
THEY'RE STILL CONFIRMING
ALL THE FACTS,

25:21.258 --> 25:23.434
BUT IT ADDS UP.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.132
SHE KNEW
THE EXACT LOCATION

25:25.175 --> 25:27.917
AND THE CAUSE...

25:27.961 --> 25:30.050
AND THE DESCRIPTION
MATCHES

25:30.093 --> 25:32.835
WHAT MY YOUNGEST
TOLD US...

25:34.054 --> 25:35.664
THAT HE SAW A WOMAN
WITH BLOND HAIR

25:35.708 --> 25:37.623
ATTACK MY HUSBAND.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.716
I--I ASSUME THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE HERE TO TELL US.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.763
YES.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.288
THAT.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.857
I'M SO SORRY.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
I'M SORRY

26:06.652 --> 26:09.393
FOR HOW I RESPONDED
WITH LUKE.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.265
I FROZE.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.136
NOT A BIG DEAL.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.965
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
OF A DEAL, THOUGH.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.141
I'M NOT SAYING
WE NEED TO SHOUT
ANYTHING FROM ROOFTOPS,

26:18.185 --> 26:19.752
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

26:19.795 --> 26:21.405
BETWEEN KEEPING
SOMETHING PRIVATE

26:21.449 --> 26:23.146
AND HIDING SOMETHING.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.670
I WASN'T HIDING
ANYTHING.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.497
IT WAS NONE
OF HIS BUSINESS.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.282
BATWING TO BATMOBILE.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.634
BATWING, WE'RE HERE.
STATUS UPDATE?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.114
FOUND A MATCH
ON OUR CAR.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.594
IT'S PARKED ON THE EDGE
OF A CEMETERY

26:35.637 --> 26:37.160
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF GOTHAM U.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.119
- JUST SENT YOU THE COORDINATES.
- OK. THANKS.

26:40.947 --> 26:41.861
UNH!

26:46.300 --> 26:47.518
HYAH!

26:47.562 --> 26:48.955
AAH! AAH!

26:53.046 --> 26:55.004
I WONDER WHO WE GOT NEXT.

26:55.048 --> 26:59.618
MARQUISH,
MARQUISH, S-S-SHTOP.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.881
DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR?

27:01.924 --> 27:03.622
- OHH!
- HMM?

27:03.665 --> 27:05.885
SHTOP. SHTOP.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.498
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, SON.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.108
I'M GONNA FREEZE YOU

27:12.152 --> 27:14.676
LIKE YOU TRIED TO
FREEZE ME, MOM.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.548
IT'S GONNA BE JUST
LIKE YOU ALWAYS
USED TO SAY--

27:17.592 --> 27:19.115
GO STAND
IN THE CORNER

27:19.159 --> 27:22.379
AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

27:22.423 --> 27:25.034
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
DECADES TO DO
EXACTLY THAT

27:25.078 --> 27:28.081
EXCEPT THEY'RE
NOT GONNA BE
PLEASANT THOUGHTS.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.778
THEY'RE GONNA BE
THE THOUGHTS

27:29.822 --> 27:31.519
OF A WOMAN WHO IS
MORE LIKE

27:31.562 --> 27:35.088
HER CRAZY SON THAN
SHE'D EVER LIKE TO ADMIT.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.614
MARQUIS.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.963
WELCOME TO THE CLUB,
JADA JET.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.704
MARQUIS, MARQUIS, DON'T!

27:42.748 --> 27:44.793
- WE'RE ALL MAD HERE.
- DON'T.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.235
AGH!

27:56.196 --> 27:57.458
RAAH!

28:00.200 --> 28:02.332
DAMN. I THROW YOU
A PARTY,

28:02.376 --> 28:04.726
AND THIS IS HOW
YOU THANK ME?

28:04.770 --> 28:06.859
GIVE...IT TO ME.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.688
OR--OR...

28:09.731 --> 28:12.168
WE RULE GOTHAM
TOGETHER.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.388
YOU COULD BE
THE HARLEY
TO MY JOKER.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.607
HEH HEH.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.436
I THINK YOU HAVE
THAT BACKWARDS.

28:19.480 --> 28:24.833
BESIDES, WE COME
FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS
OF LOONEY TUNE.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.530
IS THAT WHAT YOU
REALLY THINK?

28:26.574 --> 28:27.880
MM-HMM.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.407
YOU HAVE NO IDEA,
DO YOU?

28:35.104 --> 28:40.893
2003--MY SECOND GRADE
CLASS WAS ON A FIELD TRIP

28:40.936 --> 28:43.330
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
OUT OF NOWHERE,

28:43.373 --> 28:45.201
SOMEONE BANGS
ON THE DOOR,

28:45.245 --> 28:48.074
AND LO AND BEHOLD,
IT'S THE FREAKING JOKER.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.902
HE BLOWS BUS DRIVER'S
HEAD OFF.

28:51.773 --> 28:55.951
NOW I REALIZED
NOBODY WAS GONNA DO
ANYTHING TO HELP,

28:55.995 --> 28:59.085
SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE ME,

28:59.128 --> 29:01.783
SO I WALK UP TO HIM
TERRIFIED

29:01.827 --> 29:03.742
BUT ACTING ALL BRAVE,

29:03.785 --> 29:06.048
AND HE LOOKS DOWN AT ME

29:06.092 --> 29:08.398
WITH HIS DEFORMED SMILE,

29:08.442 --> 29:12.011
AND THEN HE JUST STARTS
LAUGHING AND LAUGHING.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.884
THEN THE JOKER
LEANS IN,

29:15.928 --> 29:17.756
AND HE SAYS,

29:17.799 --> 29:20.802
"I'M TAKING YOU KIDS
TO AMUSEMENT MILE,

29:20.846 --> 29:24.023
"WHERE I'M HIDING
THE BIGGEST ACID BOMB
YOU'VE EVER SEEN,

29:24.066 --> 29:26.286
"AND GOTHAM CITY'S GONNA
RAIN CHEMICALS

29:26.329 --> 29:28.201
UNTIL EVERYBODY LOOKS
LIKE THE JOKER."

29:28.244 --> 29:33.772
HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

29:33.815 --> 29:35.904
ZZZAP!

29:37.471 --> 29:39.560
NEXT THING I KNOW,

29:39.603 --> 29:43.346
SOMEBODY YELLS THAT
BATMAN IS FOLLOWING US.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.917
AND THERE WAS THIS, UH--
THERE WAS THIS CAR

29:48.961 --> 29:52.138
IN FRONT OF US DRIVING
HELLA SLOW.

29:55.141 --> 29:59.580
I JUST HEARD THE JOKER
REVVING HIS ENGINE.

30:05.455 --> 30:11.940
YOU...WERE ON THE BUS
THAT DROVE MY MOM'S
CAR OFF THE BRIDGE.

30:11.984 --> 30:15.291
ALICE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.293
IT'S FATE.

30:17.337 --> 30:20.906
YOU AND I WERE BORN
ON THE SAME DAY.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.213
YOU HEAR THAT, MOM?

30:26.955 --> 30:30.089
I GUESS THAT MEANS
TODAY'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.963
BUCKLE UP.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.878
WHAT IF I WERE TO GIVE
YOU SOMETHING

30:36.922 --> 30:41.970
THAT WOULD MAKE
THE JOKER WISH HE WERE YOU?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.992
THAT'S NOT YOURS.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.698
- OH. THANK GOD.
- WHERE IS HE?

31:14.742 --> 31:17.223
I DON'T KNOW.
HE JUST LEFT.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.879
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD
ME ABOUT BLACK GLOVE.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.359
I COULD HAVE HELPED.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.927
AND RISK LOSING YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN?

31:25.971 --> 31:28.016
YOU NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE NOW.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.496
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU
WITH HIM.

31:29.539 --> 31:31.237
GO!

31:38.287 --> 31:40.681
GIVE ME THE BUZZER,
ALICE.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.596
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

31:42.639 --> 31:44.728
WE NEED IT FOR MARQUIS.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.687
SAYS WHO? JADA?

31:46.730 --> 31:49.081
THE WOMAN WHO TURNED
YOUR SISTER INTO OLAF?

31:49.124 --> 31:50.909
I'M NOT DOING IT
FOR JADA.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.608
I'M DOING IT TO STOP
MARQUIS FROM WREAKING HELL
ACROSS THIS CITY.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.613
WELL...IF IT'S HELL
THAT YOU WANT...

32:01.354 --> 32:04.400
YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT GIRL.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.619
OHH!

32:09.971 --> 32:11.755
HEH. HA HA HA!

32:11.799 --> 32:14.323
I'M SORRY. I KNOW
YOU SAID NEVER TO
TOUCH YOUR GUN,

32:14.367 --> 32:17.457
BUT, OH, IT'S SO
ALLURING. HA HA!

32:22.027 --> 32:23.332
UNH!

32:24.986 --> 32:26.683
THAT IS SO UNFAIR!

32:26.727 --> 32:28.337
- RRR!
- UNH!

32:36.476 --> 32:39.348
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET GO OF ME!

32:39.392 --> 32:43.178
OHH! NO. NO, NO, NO, NO!

32:43.222 --> 32:44.875
THAT'S MINE!

32:44.919 --> 32:46.790
DON'T. NO!

32:48.314 --> 32:51.970
NO, S-SOPHIE, PLEASE.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.973
DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK THERE!

32:55.016 --> 32:58.280
DON'T MAKE ME GO
BACK TO ARKHAM.

32:58.324 --> 33:02.110
BARBARA? BARBARA KEAN,
WAKE UP.

33:06.158 --> 33:07.681
I'M GONNA GET YOU
HELP, OK?

33:07.724 --> 33:08.812
JUST STAY WITH ME.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.336
ARR!

33:20.128 --> 33:21.477
I DON'T WANT TO
HURT YOU.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.088
HURT ME? WHAT, YOU WORE
A SUPERSUIT HERE

33:23.131 --> 33:24.567
BECAUSE IT'S CUTE?

33:24.611 --> 33:25.525
LOOK AT YOU.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.135
JUST A COWARD HIDING
HER FACE.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.702
OTHERWISE, EVERYONE
WOULD KNOW SHE'S JUST

33:28.745 --> 33:31.748
A PUNK-ASS STREET RAT WHOSE
OWN MOMMY DIDN'T WANT HER.

33:35.491 --> 33:38.059
- THAT BETTER?
- OH, LOOK AT YOU. TOUGH GIRL!

33:38.103 --> 33:39.756
I'M NOT COMPETING
WITH YOU MARQUIS.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.367
OH, IS THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME
IT'S NOT MY FAULT,

33:41.410 --> 33:43.282
THAT I'M A VICTIM,
THAT YOU FEEL SORRY FOR ME?

33:43.325 --> 33:45.501
I DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR YOU.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.112
WHEN I FIRST LEARNED
ABOUT YOU,

33:47.155 --> 33:48.678
I WAS JEALOUS OF YOU.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.290
YOU HAD EVERYTHING--
SECURITY, LOVE,

33:51.333 --> 33:52.813
FAMILY, A FUTURE.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.467
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
MY BRAINS WERE
SCRAMBLED EGGS,

33:54.510 --> 33:56.947
BUT, HEY, DISNEYLAND
FAST PASS, AM I RIGHT?

33:56.991 --> 33:59.211
YOU GREW UP BELIEVING
YOU COULD BE ANYONE,

33:59.254 --> 34:00.603
THAT YOU COULD DO
ANYTHING.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.692
I WAS JEALOUS
I DIDN'T GET THAT

34:02.736 --> 34:05.956
TILL I REALIZED
I HAD SOMETHING YOU
DIDN'T HAVE--HOPE.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.306
I HAVE HOPE!

34:07.349 --> 34:09.221
I GOT HOPE COMING OUT
OF MY EARS, WILDER.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.831
FOR EXAMPLE...

34:16.619 --> 34:19.187
I WAS HOPING THAT
DIDN'T KILL YOU...

34:21.581 --> 34:23.713
- UNH!
- SO I COULD FREEZE YOUR ASS

34:23.757 --> 34:24.975
ALONGSIDE MOM.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.020
THAT'S ENOUGH.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.718
DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS, MARQUIS.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.068
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
SHOOT YOUR OWN SON?

34:30.111 --> 34:32.548
YOU'RE NOT MY SON,

34:32.592 --> 34:34.115
NOT ANYMORE.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.215
THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO RUN.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.391
NICE TRY, BABY GIRL,

34:49.435 --> 34:52.177
BUT I'M NOT MAKING
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

35:29.170 --> 35:34.044
SO I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN AN OUT RELATIONSHIP
WITH A GIRL.

35:34.088 --> 35:37.135
OK. SO WE'RE DOING THIS.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.832
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.619
I'VE NEVER INTRODUCED
A GIRL TO MY FRIENDS

35:43.663 --> 35:46.144
OR HAD TO GET JORDAN'S
APPROVAL

35:46.187 --> 35:48.972
OR--GOD HELP US ALL--

35:49.016 --> 35:51.236
HAD A GIRL MEET MY MOM,

35:51.279 --> 35:53.499
SO THAT'S WHAT TODAY
TRIGGERED FOR ME.

35:55.892 --> 36:00.419
WHAT IF I FINALLY FIND
THE COURAGE TO BE OUT

36:00.462 --> 36:03.291
BUT THE PERSON I'M
INTERESTED IN

36:03.335 --> 36:05.337
DOESN'T WANT
THE SAME THING?

36:12.605 --> 36:17.218
ONE...I'M PRETTY SURE
JORDAN LOVES ME,

36:17.262 --> 36:22.005
AND TWO...YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.442
I WAS HIDING,

36:23.485 --> 36:26.445
NOT FROM LUKE,
FROM MYSELF,

36:26.488 --> 36:29.012
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I GET SOMETHING GOOD,

36:29.056 --> 36:30.797
I END UP LOSING IT.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.586
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN THIS TIME.

36:39.109 --> 36:42.765
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
ME MEET YOUR MOM,
AREN'T YOU?

36:42.809 --> 36:44.463
DO I NEED TO REMIND YOU
WHAT HAPPENED

36:44.506 --> 36:46.247
THE NIGHT I MET YOUR MOM?

36:47.553 --> 36:48.858
HA HA HA!

36:48.902 --> 36:52.079
- YOU OWE ME BIG TIME.
- OK.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.690
CAN I WEAR THE BATSUIT
AT LEAST?

36:54.734 --> 36:57.693
I'M THE ONE SHE'S GONNA
TRY TO KILL, NOT YOU.

36:57.737 --> 37:01.088
SHE--SHE'S GONNA BE
TRYING TO TELL ME TO DO
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF THAT--

37:16.799 --> 37:19.106
WELL, MARQUIS
DITCHED THE ROLLS,

37:19.149 --> 37:20.716
SO WE LOST EYES ON HIM.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.502
KNOWING HIM,
HE WON'T STAY OFF
THE RADAR VERY LONG.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.461
SO WE CALL THE POLICE,
SMOKE HIM OUT

37:26.505 --> 37:27.897
BEFORE HE MAKES
HIS NEXT MOVE?

37:27.941 --> 37:29.421
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
ROT IN ARKHAM

37:29.464 --> 37:31.466
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.251
LOOK. WE HAVE
THE BUZZER.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.253
ALICE CAN'T TAKE
IT FROM US.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.732
GIVE ME 24 HOURS.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.430
IF I CAN'T STOP MARQUIS,
THEN FINE,

37:38.473 --> 37:40.258
TAKE IT OUT OF MY HAND,

37:40.301 --> 37:42.825
BUT I DESERVE ONE SHOT.

37:47.743 --> 37:51.181
SORRY. WEREN'T YOU
WEARING THAT YESTERDAY?

37:51.225 --> 37:53.749
OH, MY GOD. YOU, TOO?

37:53.793 --> 37:56.752
WHAT IS WITH
THE FASHION POLICE TODAY?

38:00.408 --> 38:04.107
ARE--ARE YOU TWO...

38:04.151 --> 38:05.457
WAIT.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.069
NO. HANG ON.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.288
WAIT.

38:10.331 --> 38:14.117
OH, MY GOD!

38:14.161 --> 38:17.425
YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU?

38:18.861 --> 38:21.124
SORRY.
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

38:21.168 --> 38:26.304
RYAN AND SOPHIE
ARE TOTALLY A THING.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.349
SERIOUSLY?

38:28.393 --> 38:30.873
YEAH.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.614
WE'RE OFFICIALLY
A THING.

38:34.137 --> 38:38.185
HA HA HA HA HA!

38:38.228 --> 38:43.146
THIS IS--WOW! OK. YAY!

38:43.190 --> 38:45.018
OH, I ACTUALLY CAN'T
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

38:45.061 --> 38:48.978
I HEARD GOOD NEWS,
SO..AAH!

38:51.677 --> 38:54.636
ARE YOU OK
RIGHT NOW?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.421
WHY ARE WE STILL HERE?

38:56.464 --> 38:58.118
WE'RE LEAVING, OK,

38:58.161 --> 39:00.163
SO YOU TWO CAN HAVE
THE WHOLE PLACE TO YOURSELVES

39:00.207 --> 39:04.907
TO BE ALL CUTE
AND COUPLY. HA HA!

39:04.951 --> 39:09.172
HA HA! OH, MY GO--
OH, MY GOD, NO!

39:09.216 --> 39:10.652
OK. COME ON!

39:16.049 --> 39:17.529
AAH!

39:24.710 --> 39:26.494
YOU FIGURED IT
OUT YET?

39:26.538 --> 39:28.278
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
LEAVE YOU.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.498
SHOULD HAVE BUZZED
YOURSELF WHEN YOU HAD
THE CHANCE, ALICE.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.239
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO
STOPPED ME.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.372
HEH HEH HEH.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.286
EXACTLY.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.987
SO THAT EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY

39:41.030 --> 39:44.425
WE CAN BE HERE
TO REMIND YOU

39:44.469 --> 39:47.297
WHAT YOU DID TO US.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.474
PLEASE GO AWAY.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.258
JUST GO AWAY!

39:54.261 --> 39:56.350
I SAID GET AWAY FROM ME!

39:56.394 --> 39:58.004
OW!

40:00.615 --> 40:03.531
- ARE--ARE YOU REAL?
