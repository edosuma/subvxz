00:02.040 --> 00:03.872
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.960 --> 00:05.496
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.751
<i>You're part of something
different now.</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:12.551
Part of a negative force.
Pain racing through your mind.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.074
Thawne really got her.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.429
<i>Her lightning. It was red.</i>

00:15.520 --> 00:17.034
Renee Adler.
Sherloque Wells.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.194
You're a meta.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.953
You're from the future.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.231
- The mission can succeed.
- What mission?

00:23.320 --> 00:25.232
<i>To kill every last
meta-human.</i>

00:26.241 --> 00:28.516
Cicada's dagger
can dampen powers.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.432
If anything's gonna destroy
that dagger,

00:30.520 --> 00:31.749
<i>it's this mirror gun.</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:33.274
Cicada has a lethal virus.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.829
She stole the atomizer
so she could spread the virus.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.436
Cicada is gonna kill every
meta-human in the city.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.990
15 years, Thawne.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.918
Tell me, how's it feel to know
you're about to become extinct?

01:14.400 --> 01:16.437
I guess time will tell.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.877
I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.079
Especially our
rehabilitation time.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.873
How about a taste
of what's to come?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.393
Ironic, isn't it?

01:50.480 --> 01:52.915
The same thing that gives you
your powers

01:53.000 --> 01:54.832
is gonna end you.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.354
It's time.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.873
We need to stop this plague
from spreading.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.192
We will.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.480
We can't just purge
the meta-humans in this city.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.519
We need to wipe
every one of them

02:37.600 --> 02:40.195
off the face of the planet.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.316
We will.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.398
You need to promise me
this will work, Gracie.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.711
I said it will.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.478
It's time we finish this,
Gracie.

03:04.640 --> 03:09.556
It's time to ensure our legacy.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.231
Here's what we know
about the cryoatomizer.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.118
Tannhauser originally
developed it

03:27.200 --> 03:29.715
to combat land fires
caused by droughts.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.996
So the cryoatomizer can
disperse cold air particles

03:32.080 --> 03:34.197
into the atmosphere
that triggers rainfall.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.591
However, if Cicada can replace
the cold particles

03:37.680 --> 03:40.593
with the cure prototype
she stole from Cisco...

03:40.680 --> 03:43.354
Which doesn't cure
so much as it kills.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.955
...she could infect
the entire city.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.713
And every meta-human in it.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.719
Not great, but this dark cloud
does have a silver lining,

03:58.840 --> 04:01.196
which is if Cicada
had everything

04:01.280 --> 04:04.478
that she needs to carry
out her plan...

04:04.560 --> 04:06.119
would've already done so.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.395
He's right.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.790
She must be missing something
or else it'd be done.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.234
Yeah, but not for long.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.595
She's not gonna waste any time.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.856
Whatever it is that she needs,

04:13.880 --> 04:15.553
she's out there
looking for it right now.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.199
Well, then we move
right away.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.000
We get the cure to everyone who
needs it as soon as possible.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.914
So we just up and release
some game-changing wonder drug?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.640
We tested it.
We know it works.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.554
People need a choice
now more than ever.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.235
Do we have enough of the cure?

04:31.320 --> 04:32.595
Not nearly enough.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.273
Caitlin, how fast can
you make more?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.680
Guess we'll find out.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.558
Okay, okay, good.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.599
Now we just need to find
someplace to distribute it.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.553
Well, what about CCPD?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.715
It's public. Everybody
feels safe going there.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.757
Yeah, but gathering
that many metas in one place

04:48.840 --> 04:51.071
is gonna make it
one big target, right?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.152
Cicada has the virus
and the atomizer.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.596
That makes every meta
everywhere a target.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.000
Well, how about this?

04:57.080 --> 05:00.152
You guys make up as much
of the cure as you can

05:00.240 --> 05:01.576
and Cecile and I
will talk to Singh.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.478
- Yeah.
- All right.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.438
I'm going to warn Renee.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.670
Yeah.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.390
All right,
let's track Cicada too.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.437
Get ready to face her
when we find her.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.273
Let's take it one step
at a time.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.680
Follow me.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.239
- Is that the satellite core?
- That's right.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.039
The reflective panels
on the mirror gun

05:26.120 --> 05:28.000
aren't the only thing
we got from the satellite.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.869
We also have the core and,
of course, the dagger.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.838
So they're all composed

05:33.920 --> 05:35.832
of the exact same alloy
and contain

05:35.920 --> 05:37.877
- the same dark matter levels?
- Yup.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.296
So if the Mirror Gun
works on the core,

05:39.320 --> 05:41.755
then it should work on
Cicada's dagger.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.674
Only one way
to know for sure.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.319
You might wanna step back.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.816
I mean, you don't know
what this gun's gonna do.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.674
I mean, we shouldn't be firing
this in such a small space,

05:56.760 --> 05:58.456
but what's life if you don't
pull down your shorts

05:58.480 --> 05:59.816
and slide on the ice
every once in a while?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.513
- Here we go!
- Hm.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.560
Um...

06:06.640 --> 06:08.871
Is something supposed
to happen or...

06:10.280 --> 06:11.760
Whoa.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.396
Where did it go?

06:15.520 --> 06:17.557
It doesn't matter.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.960
This thing works.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.918
It works!

06:21.000 --> 06:23.754
We can finally destroy
Cicada's dagger.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.194
If we do that,
we have our powers.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.039
And we can stop her.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.955
N... Nora, are you okay?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.679
Yeah, why?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.674
Nora, earlier today you had
red lightning like Thawne's.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.595
We want to make sure
you're okay to get out there.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.592
I'm fine, okay?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.399
Caitlin ran every test
in the book.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.234
My lightning's back
to its normal color.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.471
And besides,
Thawne's Speed Force

06:49.560 --> 06:51.552
is fueled
by negative emotions,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.593
and right now I feel
pretty dang positive.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.991
Okay. We're your parents.
It's our job to worry.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.232
The only one that should be
worrying is Cicada Il.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.355
You want me to open
the doors to the CCPD

07:07.440 --> 07:08.954
to every meta in this city?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.714
David, these people need
our protection.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.678
And not all metas
are criminals.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.754
You know, some of them are
doctors and students and cops.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.753
I know, but this is a police station,
not a clinic.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.400
S.T.A.R. Labs says that
the cure is safe

07:22.440 --> 07:25.000
and it's as easy to give
as a flu shot.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.640
Well, S.T.A.R. Labs
isn't exactly the FDA.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.280
Look, we have to do it here.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.512
Red tape alone, it would take
weeks at a medical facility.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.354
If we do nothing, there's
a whole bunch of citizens

07:36.440 --> 07:38.875
who could've been saved
that will die on our watch.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.155
I'm not having that.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.760
Well, you clearly believe
in this.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.833
So I'm willing to as well.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.480
But that means
there's going to be

07:52.560 --> 07:54.631
a lot of
political navigating.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.713
So I'll go down to city hall
and brief them in the morning.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.634
While I'm away,
you're in charge.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.478
Oh!

08:16.560 --> 08:19.120
Sherloque,
you scared me to death.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.112
Well, I apologize.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.159
But when you don't answer
my many emoticon pictograms,

08:24.240 --> 08:26.391
no, I fear the worst, huh?

08:26.480 --> 08:30.110
I was in the library.
What could've happened to me?

08:30.200 --> 08:32.556
Stacks collapse.
Livid librarian.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.518
- Really?
- Death by Dewey Decimals?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, life lost by late fees?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.957
- Ha-ha! There you go.
- Yeah. Oh.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.360
Shall we?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.671
I'm sorry I didn't...
I didn't check my texts.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.056
I mean, well, actually
I haven't checked

08:43.080 --> 08:44.309
my phone all day, so...

08:44.400 --> 08:45.516
And yet the average person

08:45.600 --> 08:48.195
checks their phone
110 times a day.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.476
- That's not true.
- That is true. Look it up.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.394
Well, also the library's
right next to the tech lab.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.836
So, you know, I get
terrible reception in there.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.216
And yet they built
a cell phone tower

08:57.240 --> 08:59.118
less than a mile away.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.112
Hasn't made a difference.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.556
I don't know,
Maybe my phone's just crap.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.916
Or maybe you don't want
to respond

09:06.000 --> 09:09.516
because then you would have
to discuss your secret.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.796
- My secret?
- Yes, your secret.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.719
Run. Run!

09:23.800 --> 09:25.314
What?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.550
It's Sherloque.
Cicada's at CCU.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.594
So at Jitters, I saw you open
the door without touching it.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.479
I know you have powers.
What are they?

09:49.320 --> 09:50.800
That.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.391
I see you too.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.360
Are you okay?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.079
I think so.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.840
Nora.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.720
Hey, you find anything?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.712
Confirmation that She-cada

10:47.800 --> 10:49.439
hasn't stolen everything
she needs.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.520
So we have some time.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.671
Finally some good news.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.515
Except what she did steal
was a Quantum Tunnel Converter.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.434
The first working prototype
of its kind.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.433
Yeah, that's the same face
Cisco made when he heard.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.920
The converter can transform

11:04.000 --> 11:06.037
dark matter energy
to practical energy.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.397
Cicada's gonna use her dagger
to superpower the atomizer.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.432
If she wants to connect it
to the atomizer,

11:11.520 --> 11:13.432
the last piece she'll need
is a hyper-conduit,

11:13.520 --> 11:16.240
and those are pretty hard
to come by, to say the least.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.398
She'll be lucky to locate one
in the CC area at all.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.517
Well, we better
find it first.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.671
We'll get to it.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.719
Thank you.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
small sips, huh?

11:31.320 --> 11:34.677
The second she saw me,
she wanted me dead.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.479
She tried to kill me,
Sherloque.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.914
Because of what you are.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.276
A magna-kinetic meta-human!

11:40.360 --> 11:43.956
That was something,
your powers, huh?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.953
I wanted to tell you, but...

11:47.040 --> 11:48.633
I didn't know what you'd think.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.713
I... I think...

11:54.120 --> 11:55.759
the world of you.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.674
Nothing is ever going
to change that.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.717
Do you think Cicada's
gonna come back again

12:08.800 --> 12:11.872
to try to find me?
To try again?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.072
Yes.
I don't think she'll stop.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.470
What am I gonna do?

12:17.560 --> 12:19.392
Well, you know what?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.960
I believe I can help you
with that.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.269
Hey.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.397
- Hey.
- Guys, you okay?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.712
Yeah, uh, I need
to tell you something.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.519
When we were running over here,

12:33.600 --> 12:34.954
I connected to Grace's
mind again.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.236
I could see through her eyes.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.834
Wait, like
the same thing you did

12:38.920 --> 12:41.560
when Cicada attacked
Alice Bolan's birthday party?

12:41.640 --> 12:44.109
Yeah, we must still be
psychically connected

12:44.240 --> 12:45.993
from when I was
in Grace's mindscape.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.675
That's what caused
the red lightning.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.070
The anger that you felt,
it wasn't yours.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.992
It was hers.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.639
We can use this.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.110
If I can see where she is
just for a second,

12:57.200 --> 12:58.759
we can run to her.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.271
Guy, this is the key
to stopping Cicada Il.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.033
No.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.112
No, Nora, it's too dangerous.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.714
We don't even know

13:07.800 --> 13:08.936
- what the side effects are.
- No.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.176
We just got the stuff
out of you.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.431
We're not risking
exposing you to that again.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.119
Mom, I want to do this.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.635
We'll find another way.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.200
We'll find
another way.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.512
The dizziness
should subside shortly.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.398
Make sure he gets lots of rest.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.676
Hey, we know
you're feeling anxious.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.399
But I promise you're safe now.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.800
Head out that way.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.678
I'm gonna go see
if there's anyone else.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.797
Should we reopen
the Cicada tip line?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.256
And Dupree's asking where you
want the security checkpoints.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.794
Uh, yeah.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.671
Uh, yes. Open it and, uh,
checkpoints should be

13:47.760 --> 13:50.355
two blocks on either side
of the CCPD.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.760
Okay.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.277
Uh, actually,
three... three blocks.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.589
Hey, you. You good?

13:56.680 --> 13:59.639
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.
Look.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.677
They're airing
Iris' story again.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.513
<i>New updates
on the meta-human</i>

14:03.600 --> 14:06.240
<i>serial killer Cicada,
who recently attacked</i>

14:06.320 --> 14:07.879
<i>Central City University.</i>

14:07.960 --> 14:09.679
<i>Now in response
to these attacks,</i>

14:09.760 --> 14:13.071
<i>The Central City Citizen
reports that CCPD,</i>

14:13.160 --> 14:15.231
<i>in conjunction
with S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

14:15.320 --> 14:18.279
<i>is offering a groundbreaking
meta-human cure,</i>

14:18.360 --> 14:20.079
<i>entirely free of cost.</i>

14:21.240 --> 14:24.870
Maybe I should call
the night shift in earlier.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.792
Oh, my God.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.314
Or not.

14:28.400 --> 14:33.429
Joe, I just felt
a huge wave of panic.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.075
We're about to get
slammed in here.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.756
Everyone, please be patient.
We'll get to you.

14:50.840 --> 14:51.990
Far enough.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.349
Okay.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.750
Stagg, Mercury, Ivo.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.160
None of them have
a hyper-conduit

15:00.240 --> 15:02.755
compatible with
the converter Cicada stole.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.536
You know, now that
I've actually experienced

15:04.560 --> 15:05.720
this whole time travel thing,

15:05.760 --> 15:07.592
I think I understand it
a little bit better.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.639
Which makes me understand
Thawne's plan less and less.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.831
Why would he send Nora back
to create a new Cicada

15:12.920 --> 15:15.071
only for a newer Cicada
to appear who's harder to stop

15:15.160 --> 15:16.674
than the one Nora created?

15:16.760 --> 15:18.877
Ralph, can we get away
from Thawne's plan

15:18.960 --> 15:20.553
and try to stick to our own?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.074
Yeah, yeah, I... I just...

15:22.160 --> 15:23.799
I feel like there might be
an answer

15:23.880 --> 15:26.679
in this timey-wimey crap
that could help us solve this.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.514
Nora, where would you find
this hyper-conduit in 2049?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.831
Probably Ollins Laboratory.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.435
Ollins won a Nobel Prize
for quantum engineering.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.795
Ollins?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.270
As in Sebastian Ollins?

15:38.360 --> 15:40.158
Yeah, do you know him?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.197
He's a true genius.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.391
A genius, you say.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.358
The guy couldn't even
stay awake

15:48.440 --> 15:50.477
through a single
physics lecture.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.918
In fact, I'm pretty sure if
it wasn't for his very smart,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.435
very considerate
college roommate

15:57.520 --> 15:59.751
lending him notes,
helping him study,

15:59.840 --> 16:01.560
he wouldn't have made
it through his finals!

16:01.640 --> 16:03.950
Nobel Prize my ass!

16:04.040 --> 16:05.952
Yeah, he knows him.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.680
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.514
Life's too short,
and I'm not about to spend my life

16:11.600 --> 16:14.274
worrying about
little Sebastian Ollins.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.510
Found him.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.592
Looks like he's been renting
a warehouse

16:17.680 --> 16:19.273
somewhere on the Southside,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.512
and then he retrofitted it
with fiber-joules technology

16:22.600 --> 16:24.114
to test out his experiments.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.671
Including one bleeding-edge
hyper-conduit.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.956
I'll go get it
before Grace can.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.952
- Right behind you.
- I, um...

16:32.040 --> 16:34.714
I... I think you should sit
this one out.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.439
What? Why?

16:36.520 --> 16:38.637
Nora, your connection
with Grace.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.960
It puts you in too much danger.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.236
I mean, we don't...
I think it's best for you

16:42.320 --> 16:45.074
to just stay out of the field
until we stop her.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.117
So what? Now I can't help
the team at all?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.271
Nora, please understand.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.312
Look, you would be
much safer here.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.037
All right, I'm here.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.237
No sign of Cicada.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.277
Great. Grab the conduit
and get out of there.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.991
I think I got something.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.480
Barry!

17:29.560 --> 17:31.438
She's already got
the conduit.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.716
<i>And she blew up Ollins'
warehouse.</i>

17:35.760 --> 17:37.877
Grace has everything she needs.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.277
It's just like we thought.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.397
Great.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.834
What?

17:50.640 --> 17:52.359
With all the pieces
that she's stolen,

17:52.440 --> 17:54.397
Grace can now use the dagger's
dark matter energy

17:54.480 --> 17:56.949
to supercharge the atomizer.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.157
Apparently it wasn't enough
for her

17:59.240 --> 18:00.776
to just kill all the metas
in Central City.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.314
With this super-charge,

18:02.400 --> 18:05.313
she'll kill every meta
in the country.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.516
All right, look,

18:06.600 --> 18:08.616
I know you guys want me off
this whole Thawne thing,

18:08.640 --> 18:10.016
- but you've got to hear this.
- Ralph.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.554
No, you've got
to look at this.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.816
- Ralph...
- You've got to hear this.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.296
So just... just give me a second,
all right?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.039
- All right.
- Please.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.192
All right, so, this is
the original timeline

18:19.280 --> 18:20.999
with the original Cicada,
David Hersch.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.640
This is the night of
the Enlightenment,

18:22.680 --> 18:24.240
when Nora interfered
with the satellite,

18:24.280 --> 18:26.033
giving us our Cicada,
Orlin Dwyer.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.158
That's also the same night
that Grace goes into a coma.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.038
This is where it
gets complicated.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.554
At some point in the future,

18:32.640 --> 18:35.030
Grace wakes up, she becomes
her own full-fledged Cicada.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.440
She goes back in time,

18:36.520 --> 18:38.318
she kills her Uncle
with his own dagger.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.596
What happens to all the metas
that Dwyer killed?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.791
Do they get un-killed?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.896
What about all the metas that
Grace killed in the future?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.752
What did she kill them with?

18:46.840 --> 18:48.911
And most importantly,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.959
what happens in the timeline
where Grace never killed Dwyer?

18:54.040 --> 18:56.271
Something doesn't add up.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.439
Look, you might be right.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.309
But right now, there won't
be any future for any metas

19:05.400 --> 19:07.312
if we don't get rid
of that dagger.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.790
Now. This is our last chance.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.679
We have to figure out
how to find Grace.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.917
Or we lose everyone.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.231
We'll go see what
the satellites can do.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.357
Maybe we're due for a miracle.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.519
Hey, come on.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.872
Hey.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.296
Do you think we made
the right decision

19:31.320 --> 19:32.640
leaving Nora out of this?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.096
I mean, the whole reason
she came back

19:34.120 --> 19:36.760
was to fight Cicada
in the first place.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.991
We're her parents,
all right?

19:39.080 --> 19:44.030
It's our job to protect her
from harm.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.200
The best way to do that is just
to keep her far away from it.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.551
You worked for Caitlin
and Killer Frost's connection.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.314
Let's see what you can do
for me and Grace.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.440
What's taking so long?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.477
Look, how much more cure
do you have left?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.233
Listen, we have plenty.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.710
Please, uh, we will administer
the cure

20:40.840 --> 20:42.797
as fast as we can, people.
Okay?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.872
Detective West,
we need additional squads

20:44.960 --> 20:46.440
to aid the crowd control.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.239
Uh, yeah, take... take two.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.711
No... no, no. Take three.
Two, two, two.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.713
Joe, we need more
alcohol swabs.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.314
Babe, you okay?

20:56.440 --> 20:58.096
Hey, oh! Hey, oh!

20:58.120 --> 21:01.192
- Sherloque?
- So, Dr. Caitlin Snow.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.676
This is Cecile Horton
and Detective Joe West.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.353
This is my...

21:05.440 --> 21:08.831
this is Mademoiselle
Renee Aldler.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.310
- Hi. Adler.
- Adler. And Renee,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.676
these are the people
that can help you.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.639
So you can actually
just remove my powers?

21:16.720 --> 21:19.633
We can if you want us to.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.394
And... and this would
be permanent?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.630
Oh, it's permanent, yes.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.576
But better than Cicada
permanently killing you.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.816
- Am I right?
- Tell her, detective.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.957
- That's right? Right? See?
- Yes.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.555
Uh, you're feeling nervous,
I can tell.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.109
But Cicada really
is trying to kill

21:34.200 --> 21:35.634
every meta-human in this city.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.473
Hey, what's your problem?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.836
Back off!
I'm standing here.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.216
Is something wrong
with your eyes?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.913
They're fine.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.576
Then get out of my way.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.239
All right, all right.
Break it up.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.600
We need to keep this line
moving.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.393
Want us to detain them,
Detective?

21:49.480 --> 21:51.517
Just give me the cure
and I'll get out of here.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.035
No way! I was here first!
You know that!

21:54.120 --> 21:55.634
Sir, what should we do?

21:55.720 --> 21:57.439
Detective, we've got
one squad left.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.239
Give me the cure
and I'll get out of here.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.831
Enough!

22:06.760 --> 22:08.956
I need a minute to think.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.597
I'm so...

22:12.680 --> 22:14.592
Renee?

22:14.680 --> 22:18.356
There she is. Hey, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey! Hey, oh!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.673
That was Cecile.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.959
CCPD is flooded with
a lot of really scared people.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.680
Are there any signs of Grace's
dark matter signature?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.399
No. Nothing. Not even a...

22:33.880 --> 22:35.360
Is that her?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.991
Nora!

22:50.080 --> 22:51.514
Barry, she can't hear you.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.597
I don't think
she can see us either.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.876
Nora! Nora!

23:08.360 --> 23:09.999
Nora.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.039
What were you thinking?

23:19.120 --> 23:21.271
Nora, you almost gave
yourself an aneurysm.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.555
I was trying to find Grace.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.632
Opening yourself up to Grace
and her rage

23:24.720 --> 23:27.280
also opens you up
to the Negative Speed Force.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.794
We don't know anything
about it.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.096
Don't you get
how dangerous that is?

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
Yeah, I do.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.760
And I still wanna try.
I have to try.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.309
Nora, you trying almost
destroyed Cisco's workshop

23:36.400 --> 23:37.800
and almost got yourself killed.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.873
Not to mention, what if
Cicada saw through your eyes?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.758
You could've given away
our location.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.071
No, I made sure there was
nothing in my eye line

23:45.160 --> 23:47.152
that said S.T.A.R. Labs.
Guys, listen.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.758
I saw Grace, and I almost saw
where she was.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.456
Right now she is putting
her pieces together

23:52.480 --> 23:53.630
and when that is done,

23:53.720 --> 23:55.871
thousands if not hundreds
of thousands of people

23:55.960 --> 23:57.394
are going to die.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.200
I can't stand around
and do nothing.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.079
Yes, you can, because that's
what we're telling you to do.

24:10.320 --> 24:14.109
When I first got here,
I would rush in to fix things,

24:14.200 --> 24:17.079
and by doing that, I always
ended up making them worse.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.550
But I am not
that person anymore

24:20.200 --> 24:21.680
because of you.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.150
You showed me
how to use my powers.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.471
You taught me how to make
the right choices.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.271
And right now, I am choosing
to face this risk.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.678
Nora, this is
a terrible idea.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.991
I know you feel that way.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.395
But I don't.

24:41.240 --> 24:45.519
I'm an adult capable
of making my own decisions.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.638
I've made up my mind
about this.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.953
So I am asking you, please,
as my parents,

24:53.040 --> 24:55.316
stop trying to keep me away
from this danger

24:55.400 --> 24:57.471
and start helping me face it.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.994
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't worry. I can handle it.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.400
All right.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.437
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.376
What are you doing?
Those people are overwhelmed.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.516
They don't know what to do.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.717
They need you and you just...
you walked away?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.176
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
It's just...

25:23.200 --> 25:25.016
Okay, did I just catch you
on the phone with Singh

25:25.040 --> 25:26.776
trying to find out how fast
he was gonna be back?

25:26.800 --> 25:30.350
Cecile, I... I... I'm not used to
being in charge

25:30.440 --> 25:33.353
of all this managerial
and logistic stuff.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.456
- I'm just not cut out for that.
- What are you talking about?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.039
Babe, I have seen you
take charge

25:37.120 --> 25:38.952
in the field a million times.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.096
But that's in the field and
I always knew that I had Singh

25:41.120 --> 25:43.157
to go to if I had
any problems this way.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.640
Now everybody's coming to me

25:44.720 --> 25:46.598
and I can't answer
all these questions.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.991
Joe West.

25:51.080 --> 25:55.233
How many times has Barry,
Iris, Nora,

25:55.320 --> 25:57.551
even Ralph Dibny come to you?

25:57.640 --> 26:02.237
Specifically come to you to get
answers to their problems?

26:02.320 --> 26:04.073
More times
than I can count.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.355
Exactly.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.231
And that is because everyone
of them knows

26:08.320 --> 26:09.754
that when they come to you,

26:09.840 --> 26:13.117
they're gonna get
an honest answer

26:13.200 --> 26:15.510
straight from the heart.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.714
Babe, that heart of yours,
that is a moral compass.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.271
It's one of the many reasons
why I love you.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.233
Right here.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.232
That's all you need, babe.
Right here.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.754
As long as you speak
from there,

26:31.840 --> 26:35.834
I promise you, you will never
lead anyone astray.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.350
Hey, oh!

26:42.440 --> 26:44.113
- Sherloque.
- Yes.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.793
Sherloque,
I'm sorry I ran.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.156
I was...
Just feeling so overwhelmed.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.756
All I wanted to do...
make you feel safe.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.520
And then I put you
in a position where you

26:53.560 --> 26:56.029
feel overwhelmed and not safe.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.830
But look, we'll go to S.T.A.R. Labs,
quiet and safe.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.798
We'll administer the cure.
It will be great.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.473
Look, Sherloque, that's...

27:03.600 --> 27:05.080
That's not why I ran away.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.516
- It's not?
- No.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.160
I don't wanna take the cure.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.596
- You don't?
- No.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.476
I love having my powers.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.676
You do?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.638
Y... yes and yes,

27:18.720 --> 27:21.792
is it scary knowing that
there's a killer out there

27:21.880 --> 27:24.270
that's targeting people
like me, but...

27:24.360 --> 27:26.158
I don't want
to change who I am.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.720
I don't want to give into fear

27:27.800 --> 27:29.553
just because
there's danger involved.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.199
You know?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.875
I want to live my life
on my terms.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.157
As a meta-human.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.031
No, but you're brave.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.796
I just worry that Cicada
won't stop

27:45.880 --> 27:49.191
until she kills every
meta-human on this...

27:51.040 --> 27:52.838
on this earth.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.718
There is a way.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.872
For you to still have your
powers and be free of Cicada.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.839
- How?
- On a different Earth,

28:00.920 --> 28:02.673
where'd you be safe.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.275
In your travels in your career
as a librarian,

28:05.360 --> 28:08.000
have you ever heard of the
theory of the "Multi-verse"?

28:10.280 --> 28:13.751
So... so this a device
that opens

28:13.840 --> 28:15.354
- a portal to another world.
- Yes.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.760
- Right.
- Any world I choose?

28:16.880 --> 28:18.837
Right. You're so smart.
You catch on so quickly.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.496
You know, some people,
they just don't believe.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.319
Well, a few weeks ago
I saw a giant shark

28:23.400 --> 28:25.198
fighting a giant gorilla
on the 6:00 news,

28:25.280 --> 28:26.953
- so...
- That's a good point.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.936
Now look, this Earth that
I'm going to send you to,

28:28.960 --> 28:30.633
it's... it's my Earth.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.320
I'll have some friends there
to meet you,

28:32.400 --> 28:34.119
but secret, huh?

28:34.200 --> 28:37.034
This trip, you must not tell anyone,
because if Cicada

28:37.120 --> 28:38.680
were to find out
there's multiple Earths

28:38.760 --> 28:40.536
and each one of these Earths
contains meta-humans,

28:40.560 --> 28:42.279
no, they would be
her next target. Hmm?

28:43.640 --> 28:46.314
- What?
- Come with me.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.149
No, I must stay.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.072
Knowing Cicada
is a threat to this Earth,

28:56.160 --> 28:59.039
I must fight
alongside my friends.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.676
You know, Team Flash,
they're like...

29:03.960 --> 29:08.079
They're like a family to me,
but when I am done...

29:08.160 --> 29:10.152
I will come find you.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.639
You are the woman
I have been waiting for.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.440
So...

29:27.520 --> 29:29.591
I know.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.520
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.876
All right.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.239
<i>Allez.</i>

30:10.920 --> 30:12.752
You were right.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.832
We taught you
how to be a hero.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.350
So we shouldn't be angry
at you when you act like one.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.960
I know you're just afraid
I'll get hurt.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.320
There's always going
to be danger

30:24.400 --> 30:26.198
that you're going
to face, Nora.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.749
And we can't hold your hand
through all of it.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.513
As much as we want to.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.350
You're our daughter,
but you're not a kid.

30:34.440 --> 30:37.319
You're right, you are capable
of making your own decisions.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.856
You really think you can
control your connection

30:41.880 --> 30:44.554
to the Negative Speed Force,
find Grace for us?

30:44.640 --> 30:46.120
Yeah, I do.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.056
All I need is for you guys
to keep our home safe

30:48.080 --> 30:49.230
while I do it.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.039
I think I know how.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.839
Let's find Cicada.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.349
Man, this thing brings
back memories.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.159
Good ones? Bad ones?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.674
Thawne ones.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.336
We trapped the Reverse-Flash
in this thing

31:16.360 --> 31:18.113
before we even knew
he was Thawne.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.716
But we actually ended up
trapping his Speed Mirage,

31:21.800 --> 31:24.634
while his real self
just sat there chilling

31:24.720 --> 31:26.632
in his wheelchair.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.474
Man, Thawne's plans got plans.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.313
But fear not, true believers.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.758
The Thawne Trap 2.0 is smaller,
sleeker, and stronger.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.639
I've gone ahead and sharpened
the inflection points

31:38.720 --> 31:40.416
to account for your
Negative Speed Force energy,

31:40.440 --> 31:43.512
so if you go full
<i>Dante's Peak</i> in there,

31:43.600 --> 31:45.353
we'll be safe out here.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.672
It also means I can't phase in there
if you need me.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.474
Your dad and I will
be right here the whole time.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.155
You always are.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.471
You got this.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.432
Let's go catch our big bad.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.079
Hey!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

32:12.200 --> 32:15.034
People, please! Please!

32:16.480 --> 32:18.358
Thank you.

32:18.440 --> 32:22.719
For all of you I haven't met,
I'm Detective Joe West.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.599
Now, I am not a meta-human.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.273
I don't know what that's like.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.671
But I do know what it's like
to be afraid and overwhelmed.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.480
You all came here
because you wanted answers

32:35.560 --> 32:37.950
and you needed help.

32:38.040 --> 32:43.115
Myself and everybody else here
at CCPD are here to help you.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.792
So I swear to you,

32:45.880 --> 32:49.237
with a little bit of patience
from all of us,

32:49.360 --> 32:53.877
we will get through
this together.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.156
Thank you.

32:57.760 --> 33:01.276
Officers, let's start moving
the line again.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.636
We're gonna get to everybody.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.839
Hold onto your butts.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.194
They're connected.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.674
I can see
the completed atomizer.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.070
But I can't see
where she's taking it.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.072
Remember, Nora,
that's not your anger.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.634
It's hers.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.191
Ah-ah, Nora.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.114
I see what you're doing.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.271
Okay, something
pissed her off.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.591
Is your memory machine
letting you back into my head?

34:05.680 --> 34:07.194
No.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.272
This is all me.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.835
I can't let you
release that virus, Grace.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.400
Thousands will die.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.757
Thousands today.
Even more tomorrow.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.638
The world I wake up in

34:18.719 --> 34:22.157
is overrun with people
with impossible powers.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.630
Destroying innocent lives.

34:24.719 --> 34:28.839
Ripping families apart.
Just like mine was.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.793
And all of this is
because of you!

34:39.199 --> 34:40.520
Uh, is that bad?

34:40.639 --> 34:42.757
Well, it's not good.
I'm pulling her out.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.878
No, no.
No, she'll get control.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.710
Your Flash family
created meta-humans.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.516
The Particle Accelerator.
The bus metas.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.593
The Enlightenment satellite
which you shattered!

35:02.520 --> 35:04.591
This isn't my anger.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.955
It's yours.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.710
You may look different,
Grace.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.554
But you're still
the angry little girl I met

35:12.640 --> 35:13.960
the first time I came here.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.559
I'm sorry you have
to carry that anger.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.552
But you're gonna have
to carry it alone

35:20.680 --> 35:23.275
because I make
my own decisions,

35:23.360 --> 35:26.159
and I've decided not
to be like you.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.394
Nora! Nora.
Hey!

35:41.480 --> 35:44.473
She's... she's at CCPD.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.794
Get everybody out of here
right now!

36:09.880 --> 36:11.951
- Cecile, go. Go!
- Move, move, move!

36:16.000 --> 36:18.515
And now their end begins.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.635
Cicada's at CCPD
but she could use the atomizer

36:24.720 --> 36:26.200
to spread the virus
from anywhere.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.416
There are hundreds
of metas there.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.776
She's going to try
and take all of their lives.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.440
Not their lives,
their dark matter.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.439
She's going to use
all those metas like a battery.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.560
What are we gonna do?

36:37.640 --> 36:39.552
Reach in, lose our powers,
destroy the dagger,

36:39.640 --> 36:41.040
stop Cicada
from Supergirl-ing away,

36:41.120 --> 36:43.077
then regroup
for the emotional fallout.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.717
Fallout.
Cisco, where did you send

36:46.800 --> 36:48.376
Fallout's energy
when he was going nuclear?

36:48.400 --> 36:49.595
Earth-15. It's a dead Earth.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.920
Let's breach
the atomizer there.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.474
I'm coming with you!

36:52.560 --> 36:54.358
Nora, look.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.154
You've already helped.
More than enough, all right?

36:57.240 --> 36:58.799
Okay.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.792
Just do me a favor.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.392
Blast that dagger to hell.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.272
Absolutely.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.669
Get out of my precinct.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.040
Hey, Cricket freak.

37:23.120 --> 37:26.431
You and I have
some unfinished business.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.796
- Nice hit.
- It won't keep her down long.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.076
Why do we have our powers?
Did we already win?

37:37.160 --> 37:40.198
Not yet.
The dagger's in the atomizer.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.999
Wait, wait, wait!

37:42.080 --> 37:43.736
If we shoot the dagger
while it's still in there,

37:43.760 --> 37:44.880
it could detonate the virus.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.838
Guys, she's waking up.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.416
All right, figure out
a way to stop it.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.716
- We'll keep her off your back.
- All right.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.473
This will help.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.393
Cisco, remove the dagger and
then breach the atomizer away.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.680
Yeah, there's a slight
problem there.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.996
Breaching this thing
anywhere could set it off.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.560
<i>My powers are useless here.</i>

38:06.640 --> 38:09.394
Then use your other power.
Your mind.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.311
Bring up
the atomizer blueprints.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.552
I'm gonna have to science
the crap out of you.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.472
Good morning, sunshine.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.816
A little different without your
power-dampening dagger, huh?

38:21.840 --> 38:25.356
Oh, I don't need
a dagger to kill you.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.909
I never had it
before I came to this time.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.155
You wanna kill me?
Come get me.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.515
What she said.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.816
Once you remove the plate,
you should be able to see

39:08.840 --> 39:10.194
the control processor plane.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.840
I see it.
It's not gonna work.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.196
I need a quantum computer
to hack this thing.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.591
Wait! I have one.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.273
Yeah.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.838
Your gauntlet.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.593
Damn, I love the future.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.436
Okay, if I can connect
to the three nodes inside,

39:30.520 --> 39:32.193
I'll override the system.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.511
If I touch anything else,

39:34.640 --> 39:36.279
<i>hasta la vista,</i> baby.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.430
Okay.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.352
There. I got it.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.636
Yeah, great. Um, how long
for the other two?

39:55.240 --> 39:57.550
However long we have left.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.675
Two down.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.395
Well, you're not great at
the Operation game, are you?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.671
You suck at
constructive criticism!

40:29.520 --> 40:31.751
Cisco, get out of there.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.797
Almost there.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.712
It's in.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.633
<i>Oh, shrap.</i>

40:44.720 --> 40:46.473
Cisco, what's going on?

40:47.120 --> 40:48.395
It's too late.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.760
Gotcha.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.356
- The Atomizer's off.
- Flash!

41:08.080 --> 41:10.151
The dagger.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.914
<i>If anything's gonna destroy
that dagger,</i>

41:13.000 --> 41:14.957
it's gonna be the mirror gun.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.238
Something doesn't add up.
Thawne's plans got plans.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.913
She didn't have the dagger
in the future.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.237
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.879
Don't shoot it!

42:13.040 --> 42:14.440
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
