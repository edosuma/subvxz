00:32.799 --> 00:34.699
Beep! Beep! Look out.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.565
Beep! Beep!
Pillow delivery.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.036
Beep! Beep!
Look out, buddy!

00:39.105 --> 00:40.470
Ugh!

00:40.540 --> 00:42.132
- Ugh!
- Come on, Jake.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.197
Sorry, buddy.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.801
I'm just trying
to cheer you up some.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.370
I mean, here you are chilling
with history's coolest friends,

00:48.448 --> 00:50.040
building an actual
pillow fort,

00:50.116 --> 00:51.743
but you just sit there
sulking.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.149
I'm like, "what gives?"

00:54.387 --> 00:56.378
I guess I'm just thinking
about Flame Princess.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.447
I told her
a joke the other day,

00:58.525 --> 01:00.516
and she didn't even
laugh or anything.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.493
Guess it's over between us.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.393
That's it?
A joke?

01:04.464 --> 01:06.329
Maybe she just didn't
get it yet.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.889
Yeah, right, BMO.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.457
More like she used up
all her laughs

01:09.536 --> 01:11.026
at some other guy's
jokes, probably.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.595
Man, having a girlfriend
is hard.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.233
No, being crazy
is hard.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.140
You're getting all hung up...

01:18.211 --> 01:20.111
all hung up on imaginary
problems.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.479
You got to focus on
what's real, man.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.881
You see this cup?

01:24.951 --> 01:27.249
This is literally
my favorite cup.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.787
Hunh!

01:28.855 --> 01:30.846
Now it's gone forever,
so it's not real,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.755
and I don't care
about it anymore.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.420
Oh, no!
My favorite window!

01:35.495 --> 01:38.896
I don't even know <i>what</i>
you guys are talking about.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.627
I think I just need
some alone time.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.192
Gotta let my mind fester
a bit, you know?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.737
I'll be back
in a little while.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.365
Finn, festering's
always bad, man!

01:48.441 --> 01:51.103
There's no good kind
of festering!

01:51.177 --> 01:52.906
Finn!!

01:54.581 --> 01:55.809
Man.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.214
This looks small
from the outside.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.013
What's this, now?

02:00.086 --> 02:03.078
What the?
Jake, what's in here?

02:03.156 --> 02:05.124
Jake?

02:05.191 --> 02:07.159
Ugh!

02:07.227 --> 02:08.455
Oh, whoa.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.398
Did Jake build this part, too?

02:12.465 --> 02:15.127
That guy needs some more
girlfriends or something.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.260
Hey, Jake?
You need more girlf...

02:17.337 --> 02:20.500
What the?
Door's gone?

02:20.573 --> 02:23.508
Hmmmmmm.

02:23.576 --> 02:26.943
Maybe there's another door
in yonder pillow town.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.681
I don't get this at all.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.242
Aah! Dragon! Run!

02:34.320 --> 02:36.720
- Huh?
- Oof!

02:36.789 --> 02:38.848
Hey, mister!
You better get running!

02:38.925 --> 02:39.949
Blanket dragon!

02:43.696 --> 02:46.028
Now, <i>this,</i> I understand.
Bwaah!

02:54.274 --> 02:56.265
Oh. That's it?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.673
Wow!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.815
Hey, uh...
how's it going?

03:02.882 --> 03:04.679
Hoy, there!

03:04.751 --> 03:08.050
I am Quilton,
son of Pillowford.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.955
And you have saved
our village!

03:12.025 --> 03:15.188
You and your sharp pillow.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.729
It's nothing.
I kill things all the time.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.264
Oh, nonsense!

03:19.332 --> 03:22.859
This calls
for a celepillobration!

03:22.936 --> 03:24.699
Oh!

03:40.553 --> 03:42.043
There you are,
Finn the Human.

03:42.121 --> 03:45.056
Oh. Hey... there.

03:45.124 --> 03:48.457
Um... you can just
call me Finn, if you want.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.927
All right, Finn.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.487
My name is Roselinen,
daughter of Quilton.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.795
You have to call me
the whole thing.

03:54.867 --> 03:55.993
Oh! U-Uhh...

03:56.069 --> 03:57.434
Just kidding.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.368
Oh!

03:59.439 --> 04:01.202
Uh, your dad seems fun.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.834
Oh, my! Puhzah!

04:03.910 --> 04:05.673
Yeah.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.838
Um... you want to dance?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.882
Oh! Well...

04:09.949 --> 04:11.883
I... have a girlfriend.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.149
Dummy, it's a dance,
not marriage.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.952
Yeah. Okay.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.952
This place is weird.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.464
Are you telling me that birds
in <i>your</i> world

04:26.532 --> 04:28.227
don't poo little
pillowcases?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.428
Nah... just regular
poo.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.869
Hey... like this.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.204
Yeah, i-it's really cool.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.304
Where I come from,
I live with my best friend,

04:41.381 --> 04:42.712
who's my brother.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.079
And... he's a dog.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.742
We fight stuff.
It's cool.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.479
It's really different
than here.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.214
Um, where I'm from,
blankets and pillows

04:49.289 --> 04:50.415
are used for
bedding.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.752
Well, they're used for that
<i>here,</i> too.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.657
Oh.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.863
Pillightful!

04:58.931 --> 05:00.694
Aw, man.
It's been nice, Roselinen,

05:00.767 --> 05:02.291
but I got to get back
to my home.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.098
Quilton, I need your help
to find the portal to my home world.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.935
Of course we will do our best
to help you,

05:08.007 --> 05:09.907
Finn the Flesh Pillow,

05:09.976 --> 05:13.673
but you're not
making a fold of sense.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.647
Please... share our food.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.581
You need nourishment.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.121
It tastes like a pillow.

05:23.189 --> 05:27.592
I'll give your compliments
to the pillow.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.859
Oh. There you are.
You found your mug.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.961
I thought you said
you didn't care.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.571
That mug is empty.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.372
I wonder
what Finn's up to.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.812
Roar!
I'm the blanket dragon!

05:48.881 --> 05:51.475
Well, <i>I'm</i> daddy!
Sha-pow!

05:51.551 --> 05:52.916
Jay, Bonnie,
I bet your daddy

05:52.985 --> 05:54.976
is just about finished
chopping wool.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.817
You guys want to bring him
his lunch?

05:56.889 --> 05:58.584
Yes!

06:05.932 --> 06:07.297
Alphanumeric!

06:07.367 --> 06:10.996
Pillow Sheep, you have more
fluff than sense.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.537
Mwah!

06:12.605 --> 06:14.095
Daddy! Daddy!

06:16.042 --> 06:19.239
What is this... a pack of
fearsome pillow goblins?

06:19.312 --> 06:22.577
Daddy! We're your kids!

06:22.648 --> 06:24.639
Psst! Finn!
They've brought you lunch.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.844
Oh, they have,
have they?

06:26.919 --> 06:29.479
Tiny pillows.
Mmm!

06:30.990 --> 06:33.686
Darling, you've outdone
yourself.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.159
Honk! Honk!

06:35.228 --> 06:36.286
Grandpillow!

06:36.362 --> 06:37.829
What's my father doing here?

06:37.897 --> 06:38.864
Pbht!

06:38.931 --> 06:40.364
Oh, Puhoy!

06:40.433 --> 06:41.866
Grandpillow!

06:41.934 --> 06:42.832
Grandpillow!

06:42.902 --> 06:44.233
Oh! Come here!

06:44.303 --> 06:47.534
But... I've come to speak
with your father.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.574
What is it, Quilton?

06:48.641 --> 06:50.632
When you first arrived here,

06:50.710 --> 06:53.838
you told us
of a mysterious door

06:53.913 --> 06:56.882
that led you to our world.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.814
Yes. Of course.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.515
Archeologists found this in
the pillow catacombs...

07:03.589 --> 07:05.887
the Pillownomicon.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.425
Oh, my glob.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.189
There is no information
about the door,

07:10.263 --> 07:13.699
save for the fact it
shows up periodically

07:13.766 --> 07:15.427
and then disappears.

07:15.501 --> 07:19.028
Quilton, I need to find
that door.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.274
Uhh... hey, BMO,

07:23.342 --> 07:25.606
I-I gotta snag my mug
from you.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.339
Oh. Really?

07:27.413 --> 07:28.607
Hey, don't sweat it.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.012
I'll make us some
hot chocolate.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.210
Jake, you drive a hard
burger.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.119
Hello?

07:37.190 --> 07:40.125
Ah, yes. Come in.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.287
Are these the great
Abba-cadabra Mountains?

07:43.362 --> 07:45.387
And are you Rasheeta,
the great Oracle,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.330
dweller of said
mountains?

07:47.400 --> 07:51.097
Yes. And you must be Finn,
the Human Man,

07:51.170 --> 07:53.934
seeker of the wandering
portal.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.372
Yes. Yes, I-I've searched
for decades.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.932
How did you know?

07:58.010 --> 08:00.444
I read it
in the tea leaves.

08:00.513 --> 08:03.380
This newspaper I found
from the future.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.178
Does it say
how I get home?

08:05.251 --> 08:08.652
The real question is, are you
sure you <i>want</i> to?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.621
Uhh... yeah.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.284
Well, don't worry.
You won't be here long.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.793
So, there's another way to...
Oof!

08:16.863 --> 08:19.127
Not long now.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.292
Ooh!

08:26.839 --> 08:27.828
Father!

08:27.907 --> 08:29.772
What did the oracle say,
father?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.673
Have we come to the right spot
finally?

08:31.744 --> 08:35.407
I think so, but the oracle
spoke in riddles.

08:35.481 --> 08:38.347
Gonna have to fester
on this one for a bit...

08:38.417 --> 08:39.782
Oh, Finn.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.479
I know you have to go.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.613
All these years,
I've known.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.520
But now that it's time...

08:45.591 --> 08:47.821
Oh, man.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.624
I'm just
all messed up about it.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.164
Just promise me
you'll remember us

08:53.232 --> 08:55.700
when you're back
in your <i>real</i> life.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.360
Hmm.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.734
That reminds me, Roselinen, of
something Jake told me

08:59.805 --> 09:01.864
just before I came
to this world.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.932
You're getting all hung up

09:04.010 --> 09:06.001
on imaginary problems.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.205
Stay with your new wife.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.613
You've known her longer now
than any of <i>us.</i>

09:10.683 --> 09:13.516
You're not even sure <i>I</i> ever
really existed.

09:13.586 --> 09:17.022
And I'm pretty sure I didn't
look like <i>this.</i>

09:17.089 --> 09:18.750
Man.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.985
How did he see it all coming
so clearly?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.857
Come on, everyone.
Pack your things.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.692
We're going home.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.097
Goodness, Jake.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.692
Why don't you do this
with your other babies?

09:30.770 --> 09:33.261
Well, Rainicorn babies
age rapidly.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.570
They don't need their parents
a couple hours after they're born.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.405
That really stinks, huh?

09:38.477 --> 09:40.069
Mm...

09:40.146 --> 09:43.604
Hot chocolate is ready!

09:43.683 --> 09:45.776
Finn? Finn!

09:45.851 --> 09:47.478
Wha... where?

09:47.553 --> 09:48.679
Are you comfortable?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.949
I'm... all right.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.456
Um... Dad?

09:52.525 --> 09:54.390
Dad, we just wanted...

09:54.460 --> 09:56.451
to say that... we...

09:58.130 --> 10:00.189
That... we love you, Dad.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.794
I remember back
when <i>I</i> was dad.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.805
Dad, you <i>are</i> Dad.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.704
I ain't Dad yet!

10:09.775 --> 10:11.936
Oh. No.
Wait!

10:12.011 --> 10:13.740
Here it comes!

10:13.813 --> 10:17.579
Oh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, boy!

10:20.252 --> 10:21.241
Oh!

10:21.320 --> 10:23.379
Hup!

10:33.332 --> 10:35.323
Hey, buddy.
You feeling better already?

10:35.401 --> 10:37.028
Huh? Oh.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.627
Uhh... I don't know, man.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.104
I-I just had the number-one
wildest dream.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.164
- Really?
- Yeah! I was...

10:43.242 --> 10:45.904
Hello?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.811
Oh. Hey.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.712
Oh.
Yeah, thanks.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.307
Yeah, okay. Bye.
