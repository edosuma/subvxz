00:22.800 --> 00:25.040
What am I gonna tell Brooke
when she wakes up?

00:26.120 --> 00:28.320
You can start by telling her
she's not really your girlfriend.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.880
[sighs] I hadn't thought about that.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.640
Hey... you're doing the right thing.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.120
We should start writing down
the instructions.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.160
All right.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.200
Shoot.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.640
What?

00:47.720 --> 00:50.120
I can't find your marker.
I must have dropped it.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.880
No... no.
What if I dropped it in Marcus's room?

00:56.960 --> 00:59.360
Hey. It's okay.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.400
Marcus wouldn't notice
an alien sitting on this table.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.400
[chuckles]

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
[trills]

01:22.640 --> 01:24.640
[theme music playing]

01:48.480 --> 01:50.040
I feel so stupid.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
[door opens]

01:54.160 --> 01:56.240
Oh, good. Here comes the researcher.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.720
Jackie, I swear,
I did not tell Michelle to talk to you.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.320
Really? She just had a hunch?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.480
I have no idea
where she got the information from.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.240
Maybe Michelle tricked you.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.200
Maybe she was using the workshop
as an excuse... to get to Jackie.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.000
And I fell for it.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
I'm out of here, you realize that?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.480
No one was supposed to know
about the plea bargain.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.200
Michelle is gonna air the interview.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.360
Everyone will find out
and then I'm out of here.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.280
I kid you not.
She actually said, "I robbed a bank."

02:31.360 --> 02:34.160
-It's a full-on confession!
-Michelle! Hey!

02:34.240 --> 02:35.280
-I'll call you back.
-Michelle!

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
Hi, Sophie!

02:36.440 --> 02:39.280
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so glad I caught you before you left.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.120
I didn't get a chance to say thank you.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.800
You are my role model.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.120
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.400
Thank you so much.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.560
I mean, those questions
that you asked Jackie...

02:52.200 --> 02:53.880
How did you get that information?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.720
I have my sources, as they say.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.280
Wow. This information must be restricted.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
-[chuckles]
-How do you convince

03:02.360 --> 03:03.840
a source to give that to you?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.920
Let's just say it helps having
courtside tickets for the playoffs.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.120
I don't understand.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.520
[scoffs] You are so cute, Sophie.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.920
[chuckles]

03:15.000 --> 03:18.760
There is this court clerk
and he's a die-hard Clippers fan.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.720
Every time he gives us information,
he gets tickets. Simple.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.400
Wait. But isn't that called a bribe?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.480
It's called getting the story, kid.
[scoffs]

03:30.760 --> 03:32.600
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.840
So... So, I have to do whatever it takes,

03:35.920 --> 03:38.360
because the story
is the most important thing, right?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.640
-Always.
-Hmm, interesting.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.120
[Michelle over Louie]
There is this court clerk

03:46.200 --> 03:48.520
-and he's a die-hard Clippers fan.
- What are you doing?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.440
-Every time he gives us...
-It's called getting the story.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.960
That's very funny. Delete it.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.440
You give me Jackie's video
and I won't send this to the LAPD.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.520
[scoffs]

04:00.360 --> 04:01.680
You wouldn't dare.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.920
Try me.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.720
Like I said, you're my role model.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.840
[chuckles]

04:11.720 --> 04:12.880
[Sophie] Jackie, wait!

04:12.960 --> 04:14.440
[panting]

04:16.079 --> 04:19.320
Look, this is Michelle's video, okay?
Feel free to destroy it.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.560
"The subject has to be calm
and to have familiar objects around them."

04:28.640 --> 04:30.960
-Okay.
-What calms Brooke down? You must know.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.920
Um...

04:34.160 --> 04:37.280
Oh, I know. Oreo.
It's her favorite teddy bear.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.200
[chuckles] She has a teddy bear?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.720
Well... it's actually a panda bear.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.240
-Oh.
-I can stop by Louis's house to go get it.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.400
Okay. What else?

04:47.160 --> 04:50.080
Uh... she likes massages.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.840
Way too much information.

04:52.840 --> 04:56.480
[sighs] Okay, look. It says here
that we also need a hypnotic spiral.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.280
Really? I thought that stuff
was only used in old sci-fi movies.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.440
Where do we even find one?

05:01.520 --> 05:03.080
I know. Max!

05:03.880 --> 05:06.240
-Sure we can trust him?
-Absolutely.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.960
I'll ask Max and Jackie.
They make a great team.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.560
-You sure?
-[scoffs]

05:10.640 --> 05:13.040
All right.
Well, then, we gotta do this quick.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.280
-You find Max, I'll find Louis, all right?
-Okay.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.320
Okay.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.440
[door opens and closes]

05:20.520 --> 05:21.960
[Daniel] Think I should give her
a massage?

05:22.720 --> 05:25.720
She likes neck massages
when she's stressed out about school.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
Like this.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
[Louie chimes]

05:35.680 --> 05:38.480
I can't believe Sophie gave her
all my personal information.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.480
Yeah, all she had to do was say,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.840
"Call Parker up on the stage
and he'll make a fool of himself."

05:42.920 --> 05:44.360
You're a real comedian, Seth.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.720
[door opens]

05:46.520 --> 05:48.520
You see? He's not here.
I bet he's with my sister.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.240
Oh, come on. Will you stop it?
Those two can't stand each other.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.040
You've got some nerve
showing your face here.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.680
[scoffs] I did nothing wrong.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.160
That was really low of you, Sophie.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.560
Hey! It wasn't Sophie's fault.
Michelle's the one who played us.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.240
Well, give us a second
to take pity on Sophie.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
The second's over.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.200
-[boys chuckle]
-Just forget them.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.720
-They're not worth your trouble.
-[sighs] Yeah. Thanks.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.640
-[knocking at door]
-Hello.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.280
-Hold on to your wallets, guys.
-[boys chuckle]

06:13.360 --> 06:14.880
What are you doing here?

06:14.960 --> 06:18.720
I know you guys are mad at Sophie,
which is why I'm here.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.840
That reporter was after me the whole time.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.360
The workshop was a set-up.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.040
She was gonna air my interview,
which could have landed me back in jail.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.400
I don't know how, but Sophie managed
to get Michelle to change her mind.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.200
Your captain saved me.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.000
I really thought you guys
should know that.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.320
[door closes]

06:41.320 --> 06:43.920
If only you cared that much
about the Eagles, Soph.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.200
[beeping]

07:06.840 --> 07:07.840
[sighs]

07:10.840 --> 07:11.840
A spiral?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Are you serious?

07:15.520 --> 07:18.240
Yes. Just follow these instructions.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.240
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-I'm sure you'll make it work, Max.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.680
No one can know about this
besides the two of you.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.080
It's only the three of us.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.720
The three of us and Daniel.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.760
May I?

07:37.960 --> 07:38.960
[sighs]

07:39.800 --> 07:41.840
If anything, I should be the one
to be angry at you,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.440
since you're the one who broke up with me
in front of the entire school.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.720
What can I say, Aspen?
You really pushed me over the edge.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.080
Okay, I guess I did. And I'm sorry.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
What are we gonna do
about Marcus and Judy?

07:57.720 --> 07:59.800
First, let's wake up Brooke.
That's our top priority.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.600
I can't believe we're going
through all this effort for that diva.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.000
[whispers] Jackie!

08:04.880 --> 08:05.720
We'll do it.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.680
[sighs] Okay, look,
I don't want anyone to get suspicious.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.400
You guys go first, then I'll leave after.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.720
There's something I have to show you.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.800
-It's about Hayley.
-I'm not gonna talk to you about her.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.560
[door opens]

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
What's going on, Woods?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.320
[Hayley] Sorry, I have to go.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.120
Give it up. She's just not into you.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.600
-[Louie chimes]
-And I have proof.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.440
You're the one that needs
to give it up, Aspen.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.280
[door opens and closes]

08:45.360 --> 08:46.800
[Daniel sighs] Great.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.520
Please don't tell her I took him.
It's a surprise.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.680
What are you doing, exactly?

08:50.760 --> 08:53.560
I, um... I'm gonna take a picture of him.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.720
Yeah. I'm making a Snapchat account
for Oreo to surprise Brooke.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.120
Oh.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.480
Well, I guess today, even a stuffed bear
gets a Snapchat account.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.120
Yep. [chuckles]

09:04.200 --> 09:05.280
[sighs] Thank you.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.200
I mean, did you see the way
that she looked at me?

09:25.880 --> 09:28.880
It was like I was talking to
a completely different person.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.120
-Hmm, sounds familiar.
-What?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.240
What is going on with her?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.600
[Louie chimes]

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
What is it?

09:43.560 --> 09:45.240
It's nothing. [sighs]

09:49.640 --> 09:51.440
Aspen just sent me something for my blog.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.960
Aspen? What does she want?

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
You're not gonna like this.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I knew it.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.600
I guess I should've believed you sooner.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.040
What is going on in this place?
Seriously, everyone has lost it.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.320
[sighs] Yeah.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.720
Which is why I'm deleting this right now.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.640
That's not the kind of news
I wanna deal with anymore.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.120
How does it work anyway?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.960
Theoretically, we could have used
infrared technology,

10:39.040 --> 10:40.840
but that would cost tons of money
for the same effect,

10:40.920 --> 10:43.400
which induces brainwave synchronization

10:43.480 --> 10:46.560
that causes the EEG frequency to change
to a dominant external stimulus--

10:46.640 --> 10:49.680
Max, you lost me at "theoretically."

10:49.760 --> 10:51.560
Our brains love patterns.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.240
If Hayley and Daniel can get Brooke
to focus on this binaural spiral,

10:55.320 --> 10:57.080
she'll be more receptive
to hypnotic suggestion.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.440
Oh, so she can go back to her normal,

10:59.520 --> 11:01.240
totally unpleasant
and stuck-up self again.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.080
Exactly.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.680
What?

11:11.960 --> 11:13.800
Yes! It fits! [chuckles]

11:13.880 --> 11:17.520
That is the best binaural twisty thing
I've ever seen.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.200
[chuckles]

11:23.040 --> 11:25.240
We should text Hayley
to tell her it's ready.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.480
Don't you think it's ready?

11:30.360 --> 11:31.720
Jackie?

11:35.680 --> 11:38.120
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, Master.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.880
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Jackie?

11:40.960 --> 11:43.080
Jackie, I need you to just listen
to the sound of my voice.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.560
Don't look at the spiral. Look at me.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
-You're okay.
-Master Max.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.960
No, Jackie, stop saying that.
Please stop saying that.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.400
Please stop looking at the spiral
and look at me.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.840
-I obey your every command.
-Jackie, please stop it. Please stop it.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.360
How can this happening?
This can't be happening. Jackie!

11:53.920 --> 11:55.840
-Not funny!
-[laughing]

11:56.440 --> 11:58.360
Not funny, Jackie.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.760
What am I gonna do with you, Maximilian?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.240
-Not... funny.
-[chuckles]

12:08.000 --> 12:12.160
[breathing heavily] This is too much.
It's too much.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.440
I mean, isn't it enough Judy's on my case?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.680
Now I have to deal with your daughter too?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.840
[sighs]

12:20.080 --> 12:21.680
She's gonna ruin my plan.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.560
Do you know how dangerous it is
for me to have you hidden in here?

12:30.640 --> 12:33.320
If anyone discovers you, we're both dead!

12:42.280 --> 12:43.520
[sighs]

12:45.960 --> 12:49.120
I just want a little peace. That's all.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.480
[R&B music playing on speakers]

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
Ta-da!

13:01.320 --> 13:03.480
Wow. How did they make that in 30 minutes?

13:04.280 --> 13:06.960
They're Ravens. What can I say?
Did you text her?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
Yup. She should be here any minute.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.600
So, um, do you think
this place is relaxing enough?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.320
Can you turn that awful song off?

13:19.320 --> 13:22.280
[stammers] I thought
girls liked this song.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.600
Not all girls.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.600
[sighs] Okay. I think I should go.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.480
I don't think my presence
will keep her calm.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.520
Yeah, you do have that effect on people.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
[chuckles]

13:33.200 --> 13:35.480
Jeez. [sighs]
You know, um...

13:36.760 --> 13:39.120
I don't... I don't think
I've ever been this tense.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.280
Hey, I know.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.160
I don't envy her, either.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.640
It must be awful to find out that you've
spent this whole time living a lie.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.000
She'll probably never wanna see
my face again.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.440
[sighs] That's a possibility.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.280
[Louie chiming]

14:02.480 --> 14:04.360
How did she get this? Did she follow us?

14:04.440 --> 14:05.840
Do you think Brooke saw this yet?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.240
-Now I really should go.
-Yeah.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.160
What's the deal?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
[Louie chimes]

14:34.920 --> 14:37.280
-Is this photo real?
-Babe, I can explain.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.280
Is that Oreo? Wait, what's going on?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.320
Look, please calm down.
I'll explain everything.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.800
Well, I already know everything.
You two are together.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.160
No, we're not together.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.840
Don't lie to me, Daniel.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.960
I'm not lying to you.
[stammers] It's not what you think.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.520
What is it, then?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.760
Brooke... this is gonna sound very weird.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.320
What is it?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.200
We think you've been brainwashed.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
I'm out of here.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.000
-Brooke!
-Daniel, wait. Let me talk to her.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.400
Brooke, listen to me.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.360
Brainwash?
That's the best you could come up with?

15:18.440 --> 15:20.680
I know it sounds silly, but it's true.
You've been hypnotized.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.840
A person who's been hypnotized
isn't aware of any change.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.080
Nothing's changed.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.560
How can you not see the truth?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.880
How can you not see
that this is what's happening?

15:29.960 --> 15:31.880
Why are you back with Daniel
when you two were always arguing?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.880
You were suspicious of Daniel's mom
and now you're her best friend.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.640
You were getting close to my brother

15:36.720 --> 15:38.320
and then you dumped him
to go back with Daniel.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.200
Your personality changed overnight.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.040
We're here to bring you back.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.640
Brooke, you're gonna be absolutely fine.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.560
Okay?

15:59.640 --> 16:00.960
Just have a seat.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.720
All right. Uh...

16:05.680 --> 16:07.240
I brought Oreo. [chuckles]

16:08.920 --> 16:11.240
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.120
[sighs] You ready?

16:27.680 --> 16:28.840
Hey, Woods.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.520
So, I figured something out.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.360
I don't have time for this, Leo.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.920
There's two explanations for that photo.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.760
Either you guys are together
or you're hiding something else.

16:40.840 --> 16:45.240
Or there's a third option,
where I don't owe you any explanations.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.760
You can't avoid me forever, Woods.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.960
[sighs]

16:50.160 --> 16:52.240
Okay. Yeah.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.000
Congratulations, you figured it out.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.440
Daniel and I are together.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.880
And I'm crazy about him.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.600
I didn't want it to go public this way,
but hey, it did.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.960
Now I gotta go.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.240
-How could you do this to me?
-Hey, Alex.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.160
I had a feeling something
was going on between you two,

17:13.240 --> 17:16.040
but I thought, "There's no way.
There's no way she could do that to me."

17:16.119 --> 17:17.119
Do that to you?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.760
This guy has been making my life miserable
since I set foot in here.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.160
Alex, please calm down.
It's not what it looks like.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.920
I'm not gonna be calm about this, Hayley.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
[Louie chimes]

17:28.480 --> 17:29.320
I have to go.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.160
Let me guess... a message from Daniel?

17:31.240 --> 17:34.120
Alex, I'll explain everything later.
I promise.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.760
[Daniel on speakers]  Brooke, wake up.
Please, wake up. Brooke!

17:42.840 --> 17:44.200
-Brooke.
-What happened?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.520
I don't know! I did everything
the book said I should do.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.840
-Brooke! Brooke, wake up. Brooke.
-Brooke, please. Brooke.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.440
-[stammers]
-Okay. Listen to this.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.440
"Sometimes, the hypnotized patient
is dependent on a key word,

17:55.520 --> 17:57.960
without which he may develop
symptoms of catatonic shock."

17:58.040 --> 18:00.360
So we need a key word
to wake her up. Okay.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.360
[stammers] Um, Marcus.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.920
Greenhouse! Eagles!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.600
[Hayley]  It can't be an everyday word.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.240
Mississippi! Massachusetts!

18:09.320 --> 18:10.920
[Daniel] We're screwed. We're screwed.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.800
Uh, canned food.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.200
Why didn't you answer my message, Marcus?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.880
What's this?

18:22.960 --> 18:26.480
Uh, just making final calculations.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.680
Everything okay, Marcus?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.240
You look even more nervous than usual.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.520
[chuckles nervously]

18:45.960 --> 18:49.480
You okay, Max?
You look even more nervous than usual.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.880
We haven't heard from Hayley yet.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.960
That's not a good sign.
She's taking too long.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.240
Relax, Max.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.800
Hypnosis can be very dangerous, Jackie.
Very dangerous.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.440
Some people don't come out of that state.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.920
I can always count on you to cheer me up.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.840
[gasps] We should tell Jason.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.720
No way.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.520
If what Hayley and Daniel said
about Brooke really happened,

19:14.600 --> 19:17.600
we don't know who we can trust,
including Jason.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.600
What does that mean?

19:20.520 --> 19:24.800
If Marcus is involved,
how do we know who isn't?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
What are you doing?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.240
I don't know,
maybe something will catch her eye.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.280
Okay.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.240
[panting]

19:47.280 --> 19:49.000
What is she doing? What is this?

19:49.080 --> 19:51.600
-Brooke. Brooke, calm down!
-[hyperventilating]

19:51.680 --> 19:54.160
-Brooke.
-Brooke. Brooke. I don't know.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.000
So you're saying I can't trust anyone?

20:00.080 --> 20:01.640
You can trust me, you know?

20:02.560 --> 20:04.680
Well, I trusted Emma, and she disappeared.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.960
I promise you I will not disappear.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.800
Wait. Are you certain
Jason sent back Emma's chess set?

20:19.880 --> 20:23.160
Why? Do you think he didn't?

20:24.880 --> 20:26.560
Wait here. Don't move.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.480
Hey, um, did you send...

20:34.560 --> 20:36.240
[continues speaking indistinctly]

20:38.800 --> 20:40.040
Okay, thanks.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.560
So he said he never got a package
to deliver to Emma.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.280
And he's been the only delivery guy
for the past two months.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.920
I don't... I don't understand.
What does that mean?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.920
It means Jason lied to you.
He never sent Emma anything.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.880
-Hey, Brooke, wake up. Calm down.
-[hyperventilating]

21:02.960 --> 21:04.880
-Brooke, please calm down!
-Continue reading! Brooke!

21:04.960 --> 21:07.240
-Brooke, it's Hayley. Brooke!
-It doesn't say anything about this!

21:07.320 --> 21:08.640
Everything's okay.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.000
-Daniel, what just happened?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.120
-Brooke!
-Hey! Hey! Brooke, wake up!

21:13.200 --> 21:15.520
-Brooke!
-What did we do to her?

21:16.480 --> 21:17.520
We have to tell Louis.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.720
What? No, no. No way. We can't tell Louis.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.200
He's her father.
You know we don't have any other choice.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.280
It's the only way
we can wake her up, Daniel.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.440
But why would Jason lie to us?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.600
Maybe because he didn't want us
to find the chess set.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.360
Why?

21:51.480 --> 21:54.080
Remember when Emma
fell off the climbing wall?

21:55.800 --> 21:58.360
It was right after Jason
visited our class.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.120
She also ran off on me at the fashion show
during the harvest fair.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.720
She seemed really stressed out.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.080
I thought it was because of me.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.440
And who took Emma away from our dance?

22:12.160 --> 22:13.280
Jason.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.040
Max, why didn't we think of this before?

22:17.880 --> 22:18.880
Maybe we're just paranoid?

22:18.960 --> 22:21.360
Maybe we're not paranoid enough.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.920
"Hey, Louis. We were trying
to dehypnotize your daughter

22:28.000 --> 22:30.720
and ended up leaving her
in catatonic shock."

22:31.360 --> 22:32.440
[Hayley sighs]

22:32.520 --> 22:34.000
You know Louis will expel us?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.040
Yeah, I know.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.720
These could be our last few moments
at the Greenhouse.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.760
-[Leo] Hey!
-[Daniel sighs]

22:46.080 --> 22:49.360
-What are you doing here?
-I'm on my way to see Louis.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.440
Come on. Give me some credit. [scoffs]

22:54.520 --> 22:57.640
I know you two are up to something
and Louis deserves to know about it.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.280
I told you, we're together.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.520
I know you're not really together.
You'd never go out with this jerk.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
I see.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
[sighs] Well, that worked.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
Yeah.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.880
[exhales heavily] Okay.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.920
[Louie chimes]

23:35.160 --> 23:37.480
"The word you are looking for
is 'Eureka.'"

23:44.560 --> 23:47.600
[panting] Look, I don't know, Hayley.
How do we know it's from him?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.040
I don't want to make her worse.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.360
"The word you're looking for..."

23:50.440 --> 23:52.480
Who else besides Marcus
could have sent this?

24:00.680 --> 24:01.680
Eureka.
