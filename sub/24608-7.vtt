WEBVTT

00:01.383 --> 00:03.450
My horse
doesn't look real, Papa.

00:03.485 --> 00:05.084
Not like your pigeons.

00:05.095 --> 00:06.544
I want to paint like you.

00:06.555 --> 00:08.398
Then I will teach you, Pablito.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.509
I am going to be a
great artist one day, Papa.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.601
You were meant to be a teacher.

00:13.612 --> 00:16.612
May I introduce Pablo
Picasso and Georges Braque,

00:16.623 --> 00:18.163
the founders of the Cubist Movement.

00:18.174 --> 00:19.780
Pablo is always with Braque.

00:19.791 --> 00:23.796
Despair, my dear, is a
readily treatable affliction.

00:23.811 --> 00:25.022
What are you doing?

00:25.068 --> 00:26.796
You don't
know how lonely I feel.

00:26.807 --> 00:29.420
I worked hard to get here,
and I am not going to let you

00:29.431 --> 00:31.631
or anyone else make a mess of it.

00:31.642 --> 00:35.277
The Nazis have labeled
every bit of it as degenerate.

00:35.288 --> 00:38.242
What do you suppose
they do to degenerates?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.888
Franco has Hitler and
the Nazis on his side, Pablo.

00:42.055 --> 00:43.754
We need you on ours.

00:43.765 --> 00:47.989
I made a vow to God if he let Conchita
live, I would give up painting.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.033
God knew I could
never keep my promise.

00:50.044 --> 00:51.085
So he took her.

00:51.096 --> 00:54.246
I've been thinking that we
should create something together.

00:54.257 --> 00:56.140
Let's make a baby.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.148 --> 01:38.274
Can you tell our
readers in your own words

01:38.285 --> 01:40.952
why you joined the Communist Party?

01:40.992 --> 01:47.446
All my life, I, I've used line
and color to try to penetrate deeper,

01:47.525 --> 01:50.970
to understand the
world and, uh, and man.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.110
Art has been my weapon.

01:54.121 --> 01:58.602
And I have fought in my own
way like a true revolutionary.

02:01.324 --> 02:04.074
But during the horrors
of the Nazi occupation,

02:04.147 --> 02:06.862
I-I felt that that
wasn't enough anymore,

02:07.642 --> 02:11.493
that I had to fight the
Fascism not only with painting

02:12.040 --> 02:15.918
but uh, with my whole being.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.065
It's radical, isn't it?

02:18.076 --> 02:20.793
I thought of your still life,
the one you applied the oil cloth to.

02:20.804 --> 02:23.688
And I thought, what
if I used wallpaper?

02:25.205 --> 02:29.204
The wallpaper, it, it,
it is itself and stands for itself.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.860
You build up the illusion
and call attention to it.

02:31.871 --> 02:36.220
It's, oh it's brilliant.

02:39.573 --> 02:41.498
I proposed to
Marcelle last week.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.042
Congratulations.

02:43.053 --> 02:44.173
You don't approve.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.940
Of course I do.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.235
Marcelle is wonderful.

02:47.272 --> 02:50.509
And yet your dark
eyes flicker with doubt.

02:52.414 --> 02:56.132
You've just created
something completely new.

02:56.455 --> 02:59.023
You work when you want, how you want.

02:59.188 --> 03:03.356
Don't you worry having a wife and
a family will interfere with that?

03:03.447 --> 03:07.196
Flaubert said,
"be regular and orderly in your life,

03:07.325 --> 03:10.275
so you can be violent
and creative in your work."

03:11.218 --> 03:14.953
I intend to have the most
regular, orderly family imaginable.

03:15.267 --> 03:16.860
I would love to have children.

03:16.871 --> 03:18.796
Well, then you
should get married too.

03:18.918 --> 03:23.687
Fernande is anything
but regular and orderly.

03:23.698 --> 03:25.423
I didn't mean Fernande.

03:25.871 --> 03:27.120
It is time to grow up.

03:27.181 --> 03:31.282
Find yourself a suitable
wife, settle down.

03:31.977 --> 03:33.735
Collage breaks all the rules.

03:33.894 --> 03:35.719
You can use anything
you want on the canvas.

03:35.893 --> 03:38.470
Dirt and sand, wood.

03:39.212 --> 03:40.936
Or paper that looks like wood.

03:40.972 --> 03:43.521
We can bring everyday
objects in, too.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.673
A strip of newspaper, or wallpaper.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.985
He spent all weekend
shopping for wallpapers.

03:47.996 --> 03:51.657
It is difficult to find ones that are
ordinary enough to evoke everyday life.

03:51.668 --> 03:55.454
You cannot just stick
anything on a canvas and call it art.

03:55.465 --> 03:56.547
Why not?

03:56.558 --> 03:58.505
Then the idea of
art becomes meaningless.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.266
I think it sounds exciting.

04:00.385 --> 04:03.118
I'd love to see one of
your collages, Pablo.

04:03.288 --> 04:06.448
Eva, you know I love you,
but you're a terrible art critic.

04:06.459 --> 04:09.039
You have no visual or spatial sense.

04:09.050 --> 04:11.842
Eva has the best
taste of any woman I know.

04:11.853 --> 04:13.052
Look at this home.

04:13.063 --> 04:14.995
It's beautiful just like she is.

04:15.006 --> 04:16.889
She even sewed the curtains.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.180
Well, you're very talented.

04:22.815 --> 04:25.215
Fernande has never
even sewn a button.

04:25.226 --> 04:28.994
She just throws the shirt
out and buys another one.

04:29.332 --> 04:31.157
What's going on
with you and Pablo?

04:31.168 --> 04:32.801
You seem irritated with him.

04:32.812 --> 04:34.528
All he ever talks about is work.

04:34.539 --> 04:37.607
You don't realize
how lucky you are.

04:37.618 --> 04:40.519
Louis is never excited
about anything.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.896
At least Pablo is passionate.

04:43.112 --> 04:45.712
For his art. Not for me.

04:45.934 --> 04:49.887
I thought you two spend most
of your time together in bed.

04:50.629 --> 04:53.530
Not anymore.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.844
I had a dream I left Louis.

04:55.855 --> 04:59.623
I ran out of the house
but I had nowhere to go.

05:04.214 --> 05:06.094
Can I ask you a favor?

05:06.105 --> 05:08.688
If the topic comes up with
Pablo, will you say that you

05:08.699 --> 05:11.871
and I are going for dinner
together tomorrow?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.113
Why?

05:18.731 --> 05:19.801
Eva.

05:19.812 --> 05:21.952
You said you were having problems
finding

05:21.963 --> 05:24.382
the right wallpaper for
your collages, so...

05:24.405 --> 05:27.160
I brought a roll of old
ones I had in the closet.

05:27.171 --> 05:31.160
Oh. Thank you. Come in.

05:35.054 --> 05:37.554
Fernande is out to
dinner with some friends.

05:37.565 --> 05:39.665
I thought you were going.

05:39.676 --> 05:43.125
I, I changed my mind.

05:43.854 --> 05:46.641
They're nothing special.

05:48.891 --> 05:51.125
They're perfect.

05:53.940 --> 05:57.058
This was very kind of you, Eva.

05:57.604 --> 06:00.984
Well, you've always
been very kind to me.

06:04.414 --> 06:07.016
You belong in a Vermeer.

06:08.262 --> 06:11.086
Don't I belong in a Picasso?

06:12.530 --> 06:15.882
I would love to
paint you some time.

06:18.729 --> 06:20.212
Will you have a drink with me?

06:20.222 --> 06:23.156
Wine or something?

06:26.502 --> 06:29.336
Why didn't you go to dinner?

06:29.370 --> 06:33.122
I don't like that
Italian painter Oppi.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.301
I heard he was going to be there.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.379
I don't really know him.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.453
Why don't you like him?

06:42.363 --> 06:44.931
Pablo, can I ask you something?

06:44.996 --> 06:46.912
You just did.

06:47.050 --> 06:49.938
What if you found
out that, that...

06:50.652 --> 06:54.127
a friend of yours was
lying to his lover?

06:54.623 --> 06:56.243
Would you tell?

06:57.003 --> 06:58.935
Lying about what?

06:59.323 --> 07:02.080
A-About having an affair.

07:04.932 --> 07:07.573
What business is that of mine?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.502
I should go.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.697
Is it this Oppi character?

07:28.088 --> 07:29.654
I'm so sorry, Pablo.

07:29.698 --> 07:33.135
I didn't know if I should tell,
but I found out she was...

07:44.385 --> 07:46.518
Guess who is awake?

07:46.610 --> 07:48.021
How is he this morning?

07:48.032 --> 07:51.523
The same as every day.
He wants you.

07:56.030 --> 07:57.717
Will you watch Claude for me?

07:57.728 --> 07:59.902
Mm-hmm.

08:01.859 --> 08:03.504
Mommy...

08:05.879 --> 08:07.470
You don't want to get up.

08:07.481 --> 08:10.840
Oh, FranÃ§oise. Please.

08:20.030 --> 08:24.449
The more I live, the more I die.

08:24.687 --> 08:27.026
Todo es... nada.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.737
Well, you're not dead yet.

08:28.748 --> 08:31.482
My stomach bother all night.

08:31.630 --> 08:33.998
It's, it's probably a tumor.

08:34.009 --> 08:36.369
Pablo, Dr. Gutman
says you are perfectly healthy.

08:36.801 --> 08:40.368
No, no. D-Dr. Gutman
doesn't care if I live or die

08:40.405 --> 08:42.371
as long as he gets his first edition!

08:42.506 --> 08:44.988
Even so, the day is waiting.

08:44.999 --> 08:50.309
Well, now I understand why
they execute condemned men at dawn.

08:50.443 --> 08:54.712
You know, the light is so hideous, just uh,
f-force you to stare at it is, my, my head

08:54.723 --> 08:57.288
it spins and makes
me dizzy and-and...

08:57.299 --> 09:00.551
You'll feel better
once you start working.

09:03.685 --> 09:07.535
Hmm. Well maybe you are...
maybe you are right.

09:07.878 --> 09:10.301
What would I do without you?

09:12.390 --> 09:16.871
Besides you have to get
up, an old friend is coming to visit.

09:18.306 --> 09:21.844
"First World Congress of
Intellectuals for Peace."

09:21.907 --> 09:23.507
I'm not an intellectual.

09:23.518 --> 09:24.917
Of course you are.

09:24.928 --> 09:27.396
And your presence would
send a message to the world.

09:27.407 --> 09:29.659
I am not a French citizen.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.219
I-I can't get a passport.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.766
The Poles will grant you a visa.

09:32.777 --> 09:34.694
I'll issue a statement.

09:35.092 --> 09:39.428
I stand for life a,
against, uh, death.

09:39.439 --> 09:42.899
And I stand for peace
against, uh, war.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.141
Something like that.

09:44.152 --> 09:45.650
It's not enough.

09:45.661 --> 09:47.208
I give interviews.
I pose for photos.

09:47.218 --> 09:49.554
I live humbly since
I joined the party.

09:49.565 --> 09:51.045
Pablo, it's not simply a Que...

09:51.058 --> 09:52.984
I can't go to Warsaw.

09:52.995 --> 09:56.029
I have too much work to do.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.875
Besides, I, I, I couldn't leave FranÃ§oise
alone with the baby, not in her condition.

09:59.886 --> 10:00.863
No.

10:00.874 --> 10:04.009
When you joined the party,
you said your art was a weapon.

10:04.652 --> 10:05.879
Hmm?

10:06.556 --> 10:09.293
That you were a true revolutionary.

10:10.674 --> 10:12.366
And now you're staying here to what?

10:12.377 --> 10:15.191
Be a nursemaid? Huh?

10:15.202 --> 10:17.835
That is how you are
going to fight Fascism?

10:17.958 --> 10:19.650
Don't talk to me about Fascism.

10:19.699 --> 10:23.473
When the Nazis came to Paris and
everyone else ran away, I stayed.

10:23.484 --> 10:26.184
And that was brave, Pablo.

10:26.351 --> 10:27.842
But the world is different now.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.720
The Fascists don't have to be on
your doorstep to threaten you.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.299
A single bomb can
destroy an entire city.

10:33.310 --> 10:35.135
The next war could annihilate us all.

10:35.146 --> 10:40.632
If you care about your family, their
future, you'll come to the conference.

10:40.905 --> 10:42.871
People idolize you.

10:43.790 --> 10:46.988
Inspire them to take on
the cause of world peace.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.746
It's dangerous to ignore this.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.106
Will it affect the baby?

10:56.783 --> 11:00.419
We can usually bring
the pressure down with medication.

11:00.847 --> 11:03.176
Be direct for God's sake.

11:04.669 --> 11:08.738
This can be very
dangerous for FranÃ§oise and the baby.

11:08.871 --> 11:11.130
I want you to be seen three
times a week at the hospital.

11:11.141 --> 11:13.657
No, no, no, no.
No hospital. No.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.500
You come to us. I'll pay for it.

11:15.565 --> 11:17.557
She needs to
be monitored properly.

11:17.568 --> 11:19.683
That cannot be done here.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.775
I thought you weren't going.

11:22.035 --> 11:26.301
Paul convinced me that I
am not doing enough for the Party.

11:27.394 --> 11:30.542
Maybe I'll actually get some
painting done

11:30.909 --> 11:32.976
without you here to bother me.

11:32.988 --> 11:36.014
Don't, don't worry, Th,
the doctor will look after you.

11:36.142 --> 11:38.042
And so will Claude.

11:38.478 --> 11:42.512
Yeah, you will look
after Mommy, won't you?

11:46.458 --> 11:47.938
How long will you be gone?

11:48.131 --> 11:50.965
Just, uh, one week. Nothing.

11:50.976 --> 11:54.019
This week has been perfect.

11:55.157 --> 11:59.277
We can keep the house for
the rest of the summer if you want.

12:00.376 --> 12:02.209
Pablo!

12:03.514 --> 12:04.970
You shouldn't have come here.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.379
Is she here?

12:06.390 --> 12:09.424
You know that she is.

12:11.712 --> 12:14.402
Pablo, why are you doing this?

12:17.464 --> 12:20.448
Why did you go to bed with Oppi?

12:21.521 --> 12:23.179
I was just so lonely.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.619
You are always busy with your work.

12:25.630 --> 12:31.267
And it was like you couldn't see me,
even when I was right there.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.983
But it was a mistake.

12:32.994 --> 12:36.645
And you don't think mistakes
come with any consequences?

12:37.100 --> 12:40.134
So this is what? Revenge?

12:40.145 --> 12:41.344
Maybe it was.

12:41.355 --> 12:43.354
I know, I understand.

12:43.551 --> 12:47.832
You're right, Pablo.
I deserved it. Now come home.

12:49.724 --> 12:51.716
Come home, we can go
back to the way things were.

12:51.727 --> 12:52.993
No, we can't, we can't.

12:53.004 --> 12:54.855
We can.

12:56.169 --> 12:59.160
I love her, Fernande.

13:04.111 --> 13:06.744
But she's so conventional.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.862
No, everything with her is easy.

13:10.274 --> 13:12.157
With you, everything is hard.

13:12.168 --> 13:13.384
Pablo, I can change.

13:13.394 --> 13:15.327
No, she's not bitter.
Or spiteful.

13:15.329 --> 13:16.372
She wants to take care of me.

13:16.382 --> 13:17.658
I can take care of you.

13:17.668 --> 13:19.801
No, you can't.

13:19.855 --> 13:22.823
But you should try to
take care of yourself.

13:25.939 --> 13:29.190
You would make me think
there's something wrong with me.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.467
But maybe it's you.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.146
You broke every promise you ever made
me and you'll do the same to her.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.972
You couldn't even keep your vow to God when
your sister was dying because your art is

13:39.983 --> 13:42.496
always more important.

13:43.748 --> 13:46.238
I don't want to fight with you.

13:47.203 --> 13:48.794
Not anymore.

14:05.951 --> 14:10.299
I never thought I would
be able to love anyone, Pablo.

14:11.055 --> 14:13.596
But I loved you.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.088
I hope she makes you happy.

14:31.648 --> 14:34.912
Requiem aeternam dona

14:35.408 --> 14:39.350
ei et Lux perpetua luceat ei...

14:56.257 --> 14:59.758
Your father would
want you to have it.

15:00.571 --> 15:04.756
All these years, I
should have come to visit.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.951
No,

15:12.952 --> 15:14.851
don't torment yourself.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.510
You were the pride of his life.

15:20.850 --> 15:25.190
And in return
I was ashamed of him.

15:25.251 --> 15:29.253
Pablo. Your father knew that everything
you did, you did for your art.

15:29.264 --> 15:32.307
Does this new girl understand that?

15:33.059 --> 15:36.394
Yes, she does.

15:36.405 --> 15:38.454
Then don't wait, Pablo.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.924
Marry her, start a family.

15:42.255 --> 15:44.963
What could bring you more happiness?

15:45.647 --> 15:49.248
6,000 francs
is bid, thank you, sir.

15:49.259 --> 15:51.486
Can I hear 6,500?

15:51.919 --> 15:54.455
I have 6,500 francs.

15:55.472 --> 15:58.423
Can I hear 7,000?
I have 7,000 francs.

15:59.044 --> 16:02.345
Thank you, sir. Can I hear 7,500?

16:03.812 --> 16:07.132
Congratulations, you just sold the
most expensive painting in history.

16:08.108 --> 16:11.181
Jesus, how much?

16:11.192 --> 16:13.592
12,650 francs.

16:13.626 --> 16:17.165
That is twice what anyone
has ever paid for a Matisse.

16:19.094 --> 16:25.728
"Amazing prices were paid for
the works of undesirable foreigners."

16:26.627 --> 16:32.541
I think that the journalist was talking
about Pablo, the dirty Spaniard!

16:34.415 --> 16:40.986
"And it was the Germans who pushed up the
prices." He's referring to you, Kahnweiler,

16:42.611 --> 16:47.346
and all the other dirty
Krauts who are ruining France!

16:48.494 --> 16:52.072
Forget that rag,
Max. They love Pablo in America!

16:53.541 --> 16:56.365
Oh, yay! I will drink to that!

16:56.593 --> 16:58.837
Oh, you will drink to anything.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.244
Gertrude!

17:05.484 --> 17:10.978
Your girlfriend
already has me figured out.

17:17.307 --> 17:20.760
No, darling Max, the nationalists
are nothing to joke about.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.406
They're trying to stir
up a war with Germany.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.416
There's not
going to be a war, Gertrude.

17:24.426 --> 17:26.486
I did not invite you all
here to talk about politics.

17:26.496 --> 17:29.556
Yes, we are here to
celebrate the sale of the Harlequins.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.400
How Harlequin magically grows...

17:31.411 --> 17:33.912
Oh! Ah, oh!

17:40.863 --> 17:45.689
I am a mess. Not like you.

17:46.682 --> 17:50.617
You tied it all up in a pretty
little bow, didn't you? Hmm?

17:51.031 --> 17:57.955
You got rid of Fernande, you stole
Pablo and now he's filthy rich.

17:58.935 --> 18:00.213
What did you say?

18:00.224 --> 18:01.869
Oh, a poem!

18:01.880 --> 18:05.908
A poem for the unmarried
lady of the fancy new house,

18:06.102 --> 18:08.549
"The Gold Digger
of Montparnasse."

18:08.560 --> 18:10.067
You are a disgrace.

18:10.078 --> 18:12.162
He's drunk,
Pablo. He does not mean it.

18:12.172 --> 18:18.783
Oh, no, I didn't, I did not mean to
offend all of you undesirable foreigners.

18:18.794 --> 18:24.478
Get out! Get out.

18:25.832 --> 18:27.915
I should have thrashed him.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.868
He had too much to drink
and Fernande is his friend.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.189
I understand why he's upset.

18:39.735 --> 18:41.701
You're too good, Eva.

18:42.310 --> 18:43.508
Hmm.

18:43.519 --> 18:44.639
He insulted you.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.088
He wasn't entirely wrong.

18:47.329 --> 18:51.231
I am the "unmarried lady
of the house," after all.

18:52.412 --> 18:55.010
I could change that.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.911
No, I wasn't trying...

18:58.922 --> 19:02.207
No, I love you, ma Jolie,

19:03.337 --> 19:07.906
more than I have
ever loved anyone in my life.

19:08.169 --> 19:12.395
I want to, to write your
name in all my works.

19:14.617 --> 19:17.817
I want to have a family with you.

19:25.847 --> 19:28.648
I'll be back in
a moment, darling.

20:04.842 --> 20:06.500
Drive to Nice tonight, Pablo.

20:06.511 --> 20:07.842
Apollinaire will still be there.

20:07.853 --> 20:09.586
You can enlist together.

20:09.597 --> 20:13.599
If I go to Nice,
it will be to stop him.

20:13.709 --> 20:14.913
I wish I could stop you.

20:14.924 --> 20:16.491
What do you want?

20:16.502 --> 20:18.920
German occupation and domination?

20:19.310 --> 20:22.134
We are artists, not soldiers.

20:22.145 --> 20:25.163
Painting won't save France from
the German military machine.

20:25.174 --> 20:27.280
I'm not even French,
Georges, I'm Spanish.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.050
And what has
France done for you?

20:29.213 --> 20:33.674
Given you a home where you're free to paint
whatever you want, love whoever you want.

20:33.685 --> 20:35.135
France has made you a rich man.

20:35.146 --> 20:39.401
So to show my gratitude, I should run
across a field and bury my bayonet in

20:39.412 --> 20:40.436
another man's belly?

20:40.486 --> 20:43.671
If that is what it takes, yes.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.233
You are blinded
by nationalism, Georges.

20:46.269 --> 20:49.514
This war is not for France,
it is-it is not for freedom.

20:49.569 --> 20:51.608
Coward.

20:54.308 --> 20:57.241
It is for
imperialists and bankers!

21:01.975 --> 21:04.609
I just need one more
signature, Monsieur Picasso.

21:16.226 --> 21:18.072
100,000 francs?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.760
Why are you withdrawing
so much money?

21:21.589 --> 21:25.166
So if this horrible war
causes the bank to fail,

21:25.568 --> 21:27.384
I can take care of you and the

21:27.395 --> 21:30.796
beautiful babies we
are going to have.

21:31.997 --> 21:33.628
Are you feeling all right?

21:33.639 --> 21:35.589
It's just a tickle.

21:37.798 --> 21:42.612
I want to make Mademoiselle
Gilot a signatory on my accounts.

21:43.241 --> 21:46.262
I'll just prepare the documents.

21:48.746 --> 21:51.246
Is this really necessary?

21:51.298 --> 21:53.554
How else would you be
able to get the money if the

21:53.564 --> 21:54.927
plane crashes on the way to Poland?

21:54.937 --> 21:57.169
If you're so afraid
of flying, Pablo, don't go.

21:57.179 --> 21:59.151
Claude doesn't want anyone
else but you tucking him in.

21:59.161 --> 22:00.675
Look, this
is serious, FranÃ§oise.

22:00.685 --> 22:03.714
I have never trusted anyone
else to handle my money before.

22:03.725 --> 22:05.097
And all these
years I thought you

22:05.107 --> 22:06.740
were in love with me
because I'm an artist.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.908
But it turns out what you
needed was a bookkeeper.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.647
And a maid and a secretary.

22:13.658 --> 22:14.913
Oh, FranÃ§oise.

22:14.924 --> 22:19.374
Perhaps His Lordship would
at least allow me to hire a nanny?

22:19.846 --> 22:22.647
You know how that
would look to the Party.

22:22.658 --> 22:25.452
You know, a nanny is a, is
um, a bourgeois indulgence.

22:25.463 --> 22:26.311
It's, it's...

22:26.322 --> 22:30.390
Of course.
Comrade Picasso.

22:31.703 --> 22:35.872
Do you think the pilot knows what to
do in case that there is some problems?

22:35.911 --> 22:38.921
The plane is
not going to crash, Pablo.

22:42.547 --> 22:45.881
How can this monstrous
bird possibly stay in the air?

22:46.110 --> 22:48.978
Hundreds of planes fly
every day all over the world.

22:49.027 --> 22:52.053
Why do you think the only one you've
ever been on is going to crash?

22:52.064 --> 22:54.615
Just take a deep breath
and look out the window, Pablo.

22:54.626 --> 22:56.343
It's beautiful.

23:03.490 --> 23:07.124
It's all squares and rectangles.

23:07.900 --> 23:12.929
A Cubist painting. I got it
right. I got it right.

23:53.468 --> 23:55.226
Pablo. I had a vision.

23:55.237 --> 23:57.404
Jesus appeared to me.

23:57.415 --> 23:59.495
Were you smoking opium?

24:00.972 --> 24:04.025
No. No, it was real.
It was a message.

24:04.047 --> 24:08.650
I must atone for my sins, all of them,
for being a-a deviant, a mean drunk,

24:08.674 --> 24:10.206
I treated Eva so terribly.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.433
Yes. You owe her an apology.

24:12.444 --> 24:14.718
Of course. Yes.

24:16.673 --> 24:19.123
But, apologies are not enough.

24:19.478 --> 24:21.978
I need to do something
more with my life.

24:22.007 --> 24:24.774
The army wouldn't take
me, so I, I cannot fight.

24:24.823 --> 24:29.992
And, um, well, I will
never have a family.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.296
Max. You'll always
be family to me.

24:34.516 --> 24:38.185
Do you mean that? Truly?

24:39.832 --> 24:43.100
Because I need you to
help me do something.

24:46.437 --> 24:52.390
Ego Te baptizo
in Nomine Patris et Filii

24:52.576 --> 24:55.531
et Spiritus Sancti.

25:02.826 --> 25:05.726
So now I'm Max's Godfather.

25:05.737 --> 25:09.632
Before I am even a real father,
I have a son who is 38 years old!

25:10.981 --> 25:13.248
And a Jewish son to boot!

25:13.259 --> 25:16.359
Well, he's not Jewish anymore.

25:16.445 --> 25:17.904
And what about the two of you?

25:17.914 --> 25:20.615
When are you going to get married
and have some actual children?

25:20.626 --> 25:23.459
I want to wait until
this wretched war is over.

25:23.470 --> 25:27.003
And I keep telling her war
is the best time to make babies.

25:27.014 --> 25:29.181
An antidote to death.

25:31.606 --> 25:35.141
The soup is delicious.

25:35.152 --> 25:37.328
The lights, quickly.

25:48.364 --> 25:52.333
Under the table.

26:00.885 --> 26:02.016
To Picasso!

26:02.027 --> 26:03.360
Picasso!

26:03.371 --> 26:06.105
Na zdrowie! Na zdrowie.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.164
Please.

26:08.212 --> 26:10.812
It is an honor to be here.

26:12.485 --> 26:14.907
They say Americans
will stop buying your works

26:14.918 --> 26:16.901
now that you're a Communist.

26:18.153 --> 26:19.223
We will see.

26:19.234 --> 26:21.754
It's a small
price to pay, I suppose,

26:21.765 --> 26:24.217
for the richest
painter in the world.

26:25.957 --> 26:27.657
Do you know my work?

26:27.893 --> 26:29.043
Yes.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.605
And I wonder, why do
you continue to paint

26:32.785 --> 26:35.863
in bourgeois
impressionist-surrealist style?

26:35.874 --> 26:37.674
Please. Be respectful.

26:37.950 --> 26:39.542
Impressionist-surrealist?

26:39.553 --> 26:43.155
If you are going to denigrate me,
at least use the correct terms,

26:43.187 --> 26:46.188
and insult me for Cubism.

26:46.199 --> 26:48.342
Where do your
paintings hang, Comrade Picasso?

26:48.352 --> 26:49.874
In rich people's homes.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.560
Who else can afford them?

26:51.571 --> 26:53.954
You are not the first to
tell me my work does not conform

26:53.964 --> 26:56.124
to someone else's idea of
what it should be.

26:56.135 --> 26:59.113
And why don't you paint in simpler,
more clearly understood symbolism?

26:59.123 --> 27:02.283
If I were a shoemaker, would I have
to hammer my shoes a special way

27:02.294 --> 27:03.995
just to show my politics?

27:04.006 --> 27:06.423
Your work is not Communist.

27:06.434 --> 27:08.301
I am a Communist.

27:08.312 --> 27:10.879
If I make a painting,
it's a Communist painting.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.349
Men ennoble themselves
by working for the common good,

27:14.360 --> 27:16.227
not to enrich themselves.

27:16.238 --> 27:19.204
Your painting is decadent, Comrade.

27:20.819 --> 27:24.204
The Nazis
called it "degenerate."

27:28.508 --> 27:30.876
You are exactly the same.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.427
So now I am not
Communist enough? Hmm!

27:44.438 --> 27:47.978
Did you listen to those bastards who
condemn me for joining the Party?

27:48.034 --> 27:49.268
Who cares what he thinks?

27:49.278 --> 27:50.961
Marcel, we are
going back to Paris.

27:50.971 --> 27:52.437
Please, Comrade Picasso, don't...

27:52.439 --> 27:54.364
Forget Lvovich,
he's small-minded

27:54.374 --> 27:55.721
and doesn't understand
what we're trying to do.

27:55.731 --> 27:59.732
Pablo, you remember
Pierre Daix, the writer.

28:00.904 --> 28:05.876
Please, if you'll permit me, I'd like to
show you what we are fighting against.

28:14.863 --> 28:17.220
Arbeit Macht Frei.

28:19.652 --> 28:21.649
Work makes you free.

28:23.379 --> 28:25.243
A great lie, of course.

28:28.543 --> 28:31.110
There was no freedom.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.655
Not for political prisoners like me.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.833
Not for homosexuals.

28:36.984 --> 28:40.149
And certainly not for the Jews.

28:41.077 --> 28:45.907
Those who didn't die on the journey
were separated as soon as they arrived.

28:46.482 --> 28:49.174
Babies ripped from mothers' arms,

28:50.137 --> 28:52.494
the strong sent to work.

28:52.929 --> 28:55.353
The weak to the showers.

29:11.122 --> 29:13.360
Another lie, of course.

29:14.735 --> 29:17.639
No water poured from
these pipes,

29:18.298 --> 29:22.140
only poison gas snaking
down from the ceiling.

29:24.636 --> 29:27.914
Naked people, shivering, humiliated,

29:28.806 --> 29:30.915
crammed shoulder to shoulder,

29:32.539 --> 29:35.289
women, men, tiny children,

29:36.360 --> 29:40.094
their screams ending only when
the vapor stole their voices,

29:40.612 --> 29:42.821
choking the life out of them.

29:53.654 --> 29:56.491
This miserable war.
Will it ever end?

29:56.502 --> 29:58.537
If you hate the war so
much, why don't you stop belly-aching

29:58.547 --> 29:59.939
and actually do something about it?

29:59.949 --> 30:01.248
What can I do?

30:01.259 --> 30:03.859
Gertrude and I are driving
supplies to local hospitals.

30:04.004 --> 30:05.101
That's wonderful.

30:05.112 --> 30:07.456
It's not enough to
declare yourself a pacifist, Pablo.

30:07.466 --> 30:10.650
You have a very loud voice and
an obligation to make it heard.

30:10.754 --> 30:12.694
I am not a politician.

30:12.705 --> 30:15.033
No, but you are one of
the most famous artists in Europe.

30:15.043 --> 30:17.561
Use your art to speak
out against the war.

30:17.572 --> 30:18.976
Art should not be political.

30:18.987 --> 30:21.841
Well that's a very principled position
and a convenient one, isn't it?

30:21.851 --> 30:26.022
You get to do nothing and still feel
morally superior to everyone else.

30:26.781 --> 30:29.140
You say your art is a weapon.

30:29.666 --> 30:32.267
So use it to speak out
against these atrocities.

30:32.278 --> 30:33.910
Comrade Eluard is right.

30:33.921 --> 30:38.023
The Nazis may be gone, but Franco
still rules your beloved Spain.

30:38.357 --> 30:40.790
Fascism is not dead.

30:40.801 --> 30:43.485
And our Party is
dedicated to fighting it.

30:43.754 --> 30:48.351
To make sure that this
never happens again.

30:48.996 --> 30:51.765
Paint a peace symbol, Pablo.

30:52.793 --> 30:55.218
For the Party conference in Paris.

31:05.906 --> 31:10.598
Oh-oh! It's from Papa.

31:29.616 --> 31:33.754
I'm sorry it wasn't a more pleasant
evening, we'll have more fun next time.

31:33.765 --> 31:38.739
Nonsense, there's no one we'd rather
hide under a table with than the two...

31:44.704 --> 31:47.305
Eva? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

31:51.565 --> 31:55.222
You have lung cancer.
I'm sorry.

31:59.495 --> 32:01.566
How do we treat it?

32:02.807 --> 32:06.792
We will do everything
we can to make you comfortable.

32:23.099 --> 32:24.687
Papa's home!

32:27.322 --> 32:29.817
Oh. Hey.

32:36.777 --> 32:39.160
Aren't you glad to see me?

32:39.287 --> 32:42.222
You said you'd be
gone one week, it's been three.

32:42.233 --> 32:45.835
Didn't you get my telegrams?

32:50.322 --> 32:54.907
You mean the ones
addressed to "Madame Picasso"?

32:54.918 --> 32:57.486
You couldn't be bothered
to send them, so you what?

32:57.497 --> 33:01.132
Had Marcel write them?

33:02.679 --> 33:05.104
How dare you abandon me.

33:06.396 --> 33:09.831
You are exaggerating, FranÃ§oise.

33:09.985 --> 33:16.816
Then you didn't just leave me alone,
sick and pregnant to care for

33:16.879 --> 33:20.046
a baby for almost a month?

33:20.154 --> 33:23.756
I was doing something important.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.882
Something much bigger than
taking care of one baby.

33:26.893 --> 33:29.510
So now it's not only your
art that comes before your family,

33:29.520 --> 33:30.852
it's politics as well.

33:30.863 --> 33:35.359
I was in a country
ravaged by bombs, misery and death.

33:35.369 --> 33:39.508
Talking with leaders of the
world about how to stop war.

33:40.443 --> 33:45.320
You're right.
My concerns are trivial.

33:51.716 --> 33:54.027
Accounts, baths,

33:54.816 --> 33:57.457
doctor's visits,

33:57.685 --> 33:59.988
laundry, vomit.

33:59.999 --> 34:02.249
How difficult has it
really been for you?

34:02.665 --> 34:04.197
Were you starving?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.709
Were you beaten and-and
worked to death?

34:06.791 --> 34:10.386
Was Claude ripped from
your arms by Nazis?

34:11.080 --> 34:16.003
So unless I'm a victim of Nazi
war crimes, my concerns don't matter?

34:17.833 --> 34:20.551
You were the one who
wanted children, Pablo.

34:20.562 --> 34:22.328
And I agreed.

34:22.431 --> 34:26.902
But I didn't agree to give up my work
so I could cater to all your needs.

34:29.215 --> 34:31.347
I'm sorry, my love.

34:32.951 --> 34:35.668
You can't imagine what I saw.

34:35.869 --> 34:41.081
We can't live with blinders on,
fixated on our little family,

34:41.119 --> 34:43.786
shut off from the struggles
of the rest of the world.

34:43.797 --> 34:47.099
We, we have to do more for others.

34:47.132 --> 34:50.368
That is a very
noble sentiment, Pablo.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.161
But is it really why you went?

34:52.172 --> 34:53.405
What do you mean?

34:53.416 --> 34:55.373
I mean maybe you're just bored.

34:55.385 --> 34:59.186
Maybe you want to get away from us,
maybe you don't like me

34:59.197 --> 35:02.058
turning into a giant bump again.

35:02.271 --> 35:04.971
You have never
been so beautiful to me.

35:09.386 --> 35:11.566
But you are right.

35:12.808 --> 35:15.417
I did want to get away.

35:16.049 --> 35:21.464
When Lamaze said you were sick, that you
have to go and see doctors in the hospital,

35:23.933 --> 35:27.282
I, I had an urge to run.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.207
And it's terrible, I know.

35:29.218 --> 35:34.021
But suddenly I thought,
maybe it was happening again.

35:36.149 --> 35:38.675
What was happening again?

35:45.965 --> 35:48.527
I'm so tired.

35:50.001 --> 35:53.735
I know, my love.
But don't be discouraged.

35:53.763 --> 35:56.164
You're going to be home soon.

35:56.175 --> 36:00.293
Pablo, I won't be coming home.

36:00.496 --> 36:02.227
Of course you will.

36:02.238 --> 36:05.344
We're going to get
married and have babies.

36:05.447 --> 36:06.780
Pablo.

36:06.931 --> 36:10.946
You will get married and
you will have a family.

36:12.609 --> 36:14.676
But not with me.

36:14.687 --> 36:17.704
You're not thinking clearly.
It's the morphine.

36:18.060 --> 36:19.826
You're going to get well soon.

36:19.837 --> 36:23.505
And I'm coming every day to
sit with you until you do.

36:23.933 --> 36:26.767
It's a long train ride
to make so often, Pablo.

36:26.933 --> 36:31.922
I don't mind. Because
at the end of it there is you.

36:34.912 --> 36:36.774
You're very sweet.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.813
But now I need to rest.

36:45.972 --> 36:47.930
You should go home.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.488
Monsieur Picasso.
I, I'm Jean Cocteau.

37:01.499 --> 37:03.941
I'm a great admirer of yours.

37:04.837 --> 37:08.774
Um, I'm about to leave for the front, I
was hoping you would paint my portrait,

37:08.785 --> 37:10.816
it's for my mother.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.191
The woman I love is dying.

37:14.938 --> 37:17.939
You think I want to paint
your goddamn portrait?

37:19.033 --> 37:21.691
I'm sorry, I'm...

38:19.565 --> 38:24.768
We need a stretcher.
This one's alive.

39:36.526 --> 39:39.194
My fiancÃ©'s at the front.

39:39.508 --> 39:41.877
Why aren't you?

39:43.634 --> 39:46.877
I don't believe in war.

39:55.379 --> 39:57.413
What about you?

39:58.558 --> 40:00.710
You must have someone else, too.

40:35.283 --> 40:37.645
How do I look?

40:38.140 --> 40:41.608
Like I could paint
you for the rest of my life.

40:41.786 --> 40:46.022
Here. Lace me up.

40:54.301 --> 40:58.770
Marry me. Gaby.

40:59.216 --> 41:01.950
I have a fiancÃ©.

41:01.961 --> 41:04.291
And you just lost the woman you love.

41:04.302 --> 41:06.768
I want to give you everything.

41:06.983 --> 41:10.275
Paintings, children.

41:13.637 --> 41:17.947
I know you're in pain,
but this isn't the answer.

41:20.310 --> 41:23.545
I'm sorry, Pablo. I can't.

41:26.178 --> 41:28.705
The doctors want to drill into
my skull to relieve the pressure.

41:28.715 --> 41:31.082
But they don't know if it
will give me my sight back.

41:31.093 --> 41:32.576
I'm sure it will.

41:32.587 --> 41:34.427
Marcelle says the same.

41:34.481 --> 41:36.147
She's so innocent.

41:36.158 --> 41:37.937
She still wants a family.

41:37.948 --> 41:39.535
You'll have beautiful children.

41:39.545 --> 41:42.012
Every night I dream
about leaving the trench.

41:42.023 --> 41:45.758
As soon as I'm over the top,
my fear turns to terror.

41:45.769 --> 41:48.369
My nose fills with Sulphur.

41:48.489 --> 41:51.830
I taste metal on the
roof of my mouth.

41:55.932 --> 42:00.447
She'll never understand
and neither will you.

42:02.178 --> 42:03.646
No, I, I don't suppose I could.

42:03.657 --> 42:07.910
You stayed at home painting and now
I may never be able to paint again.

42:09.596 --> 42:10.929
Braque is right.

42:10.940 --> 42:14.475
I hid in my studio while
the rest of you suffered.

42:14.514 --> 42:16.514
I am so sorry, Guillaume.

42:16.525 --> 42:18.926
You were right not to go, Pablo.

42:18.937 --> 42:22.821
Artists should create, not destroy.

42:22.832 --> 42:24.391
But what have I created?

42:24.402 --> 42:25.934
Not even a child.

42:25.945 --> 42:29.312
Only pretty pictures
for Eva and Gaby.

42:29.518 --> 42:32.694
I should have at least tried to
create something to tell the world

42:32.705 --> 42:35.509
how I feel about this wretched war.

42:38.042 --> 42:43.053
We heard you donated a million
francs to the striking miners!

42:43.373 --> 42:45.640
What a magnanimous gesture.

42:45.651 --> 42:48.118
You're becoming quite
the philanthropist, Pablo.

42:48.129 --> 42:52.762
And now, you're doing the art for
the Paris peace conference as well.

42:52.773 --> 42:54.725
What will you paint?

42:56.156 --> 42:57.755
I don't know yet.

42:57.766 --> 42:59.491
Marie's trying
to get me to attend.

42:59.533 --> 43:02.936
You should go.
Paul Robeson is coming from America.

43:02.947 --> 43:03.772
Hmm.

43:03.895 --> 43:04.983
Do you know him?

43:04.994 --> 43:05.712
The singer?

43:05.723 --> 43:07.384
His father was a runaway slave.

43:07.394 --> 43:09.052
He and Pablo have been corresponding.

43:09.063 --> 43:12.643
Marie and I were thinking, with all
the causes you have been taking up,

43:12.654 --> 43:16.389
perhaps you would donate a few painting
to our little Museum in Antibes.

43:16.846 --> 43:19.280
Oh, your museum is a cause now?

43:19.349 --> 43:21.883
Art is its own cause, is it not?

43:21.894 --> 43:24.228
You cater to rich tourists.

43:24.239 --> 43:30.545
Well, I suppose, but,
a gift from you would really help us.

43:30.556 --> 43:32.381
Perhaps I can
help you in return.

43:32.392 --> 43:36.639
We heard you got trouble traveling to
Poland because you don't have a passport.

43:36.650 --> 43:39.299
I still have friends in the Conseil
des Ministres who could secure

43:39.309 --> 43:41.476
French citizenship for you.

43:41.487 --> 43:46.506
First you demand a gift then
you want me to change my nationality?

43:46.517 --> 43:50.529
I'm Spanish.
I represent Spain in exile.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.801
Pablo, I do not mean...

43:51.812 --> 43:54.350
And as long as a Fascist
dictator rules over my people,

43:54.360 --> 43:56.793
I will stand in solidarity with them.

43:56.804 --> 43:58.362
FranÃ§oise, people are staring.

43:58.373 --> 44:01.441
And what gives you the
right to ask for my paintings?

44:01.452 --> 44:03.235
Do you think I paint them for you?

44:03.246 --> 44:05.312
What do you think an artist is?

44:05.323 --> 44:08.826
An idiot who paints to
decorate the walls of museums?

44:11.592 --> 44:13.450
And why have you stopped eating?

44:13.461 --> 44:16.396
Food here isn't good enough for you?

44:17.783 --> 44:19.679
FranÃ§oise!

44:20.928 --> 44:24.023
Don't look at me.
I agree with him.

44:25.575 --> 44:28.413
Thank you for taking my side.

44:30.378 --> 44:33.678
We are allies, Pablo.

44:44.492 --> 44:48.034
In Warsaw, a Soviet donkey

44:49.534 --> 44:52.361
told me I should make art with

44:52.575 --> 44:55.886
a more easily understood symbolism.

44:58.163 --> 45:01.530
I'm sure you
appreciated his suggestion.

45:01.541 --> 45:05.378
Even if I agree
with it, I wouldn't know how.

45:06.145 --> 45:11.105
I mean, I, sense, I see, I paint.

45:13.908 --> 45:18.448
The next day even I, I, I
don't know how I have done it.

45:25.500 --> 45:32.238
I need a universal symbol, but I
can't find it except instinctively

45:32.249 --> 45:36.284
and, and unconsciously.

45:39.329 --> 45:42.569
If you want something instinctive,
go back to the beginning.

45:45.893 --> 45:50.255
My beginning
was picadors and pigeons.

45:54.054 --> 45:56.577
Hmm. Then start there.

46:11.604 --> 46:13.562
My horse
doesn't look real, Papa.

46:13.572 --> 46:14.730
I want to paint like you.

46:14.740 --> 46:16.656
I will teach you, Pablito.

46:16.667 --> 46:20.367
My horse doesn't
look like your pigeon...

46:20.494 --> 46:23.829
You have taught
me all I need to know.

46:26.731 --> 46:28.630
A pigeon?

46:28.641 --> 46:33.188
A dove. Paloma in Spanish.

46:34.297 --> 46:36.609
My father bred them.

46:39.028 --> 46:43.609
Honestly, I was expecting
a worker holding a hammer

46:43.728 --> 46:46.996
or someone laying down his sword.

46:49.431 --> 46:51.633
Too literal.

46:52.509 --> 46:55.610
But the Bible does
tell beautiful stories.

46:55.621 --> 46:59.623
Like the Paloma bringing an olive
branch to Noah after the flood.

47:01.852 --> 47:08.162
Yes. To symbolize that
God had made peace with mankind.

47:12.767 --> 47:14.931
It's beautiful, Pablo.

47:15.585 --> 47:18.751
Hmm. And it's also hideous.

47:20.561 --> 47:25.114
One day, my father
brought home a baby bird.

47:26.733 --> 47:29.967
And I saw a pair of
doves peck it to death.

47:29.978 --> 47:32.884
Now how is that
for a symbol of peace?

47:33.558 --> 47:35.767
I don't understand you.

47:36.730 --> 47:40.923
Art is the lie
that tells the truth.

47:42.937 --> 47:47.472
Don't try to understand.
You have to feel.

47:47.483 --> 47:50.884
And I hope this dove
makes people feel.

47:51.153 --> 47:52.537
The truth.

47:53.557 --> 47:56.935
That we are capable of the
most horrible violence.

47:59.037 --> 48:02.060
Which is why we must
fight so hard against it.

48:04.793 --> 48:07.260
It feels as though
the baby is fighting me.

48:07.669 --> 48:09.912
It wants to stay, but I want it out.

48:09.942 --> 48:15.393
I agree. It's time
to induce labor. I'll call Pablo.

48:15.895 --> 48:18.996
No. The last place
he wants to be is a hospital.

48:19.007 --> 48:20.306
It would upset him.

48:20.317 --> 48:22.117
FranÃ§oise,
this is his child, too.

48:22.128 --> 48:23.920
But he's at
the Peace Conference.

48:23.931 --> 48:25.864
It's important.

48:25.875 --> 48:29.226
More important than his family?

48:55.500 --> 48:58.935
Push, push, push. Yes.

49:02.493 --> 49:04.492
Ready? Now, push.

49:04.984 --> 49:09.253
<i>I dreamed
I saw Joe Hill last night âª</i>

49:09.302 --> 49:13.103
<i>âª Alive as you and me âª</i>

49:13.114 --> 49:17.550
<i>âª Says I but Joe,
you're ten years dead âª</i>

49:17.561 --> 49:22.747
<i>âª I never died says he âª</i>

49:23.025 --> 49:29.863
<i>âª I never died says he âª</i>

49:29.968 --> 49:36.039
<i>âª Says he âª</i>

49:45.483 --> 49:49.318
Hey. Are you all right?

49:49.927 --> 49:51.268
Oh.

49:51.853 --> 49:53.002
Oh, oh, oh!

49:53.013 --> 49:54.448
Look at her.

49:54.459 --> 49:57.227
She's a work of art.

49:57.511 --> 50:01.012
And we made her. Together.

50:02.312 --> 50:06.252
Paloma.
We will call her Paloma.

50:07.973 --> 50:09.506
Paloma.

50:09.517 --> 50:10.517
Yes.

50:10.528 --> 50:12.387
Now that's a lovely name.

50:12.398 --> 50:15.799
That way we can be sure.

50:15.827 --> 50:17.560
Sure of what?

50:17.571 --> 50:21.574
That we will always
have peace in our family.

50:26.823 --> 50:29.128
Paloma. Oh!
