WEBVTT

01:13.574 --> 01:16.577
We have to
decide how we're going to kill this bitch.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.162
I know Fami's death affected you deeply.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.998
It hurt us all.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.126
We can figure it out
when we get to the compound.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.337
Let's kill her,
record it and see if that makes an impact.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.755
Let's do it now!

01:34.845 --> 01:35.846
Let's go!

01:36.513 --> 01:37.347
Vámonos.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.575
Go.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.019
A little step. One more.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.735
Go.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.883
I got Amber!

04:48.372 --> 04:49.915
Relax.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.418
You made the right decision
not to kill her.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.051
Let her rot in there.
It's worse than death.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.773
We know where they are taking her.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.067
A cocaine place full of Venezuelan army.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.904
My friend,

06:01.987 --> 06:03.614
let's not wait.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.324
They killed my men.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.868
They have to be punished, and they will.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.703
But the General is right.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.039
We cannot engage
on this side of the border.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.653
Attacking a facility
on this side of the border,

06:42.736 --> 06:45.822
so closely tied
to the Venezuelan government,

06:46.990 --> 06:48.784
would be seen as an act of war.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.789
As Colombian Army,
this is as far as we can go for now.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.418
It's time to go home
and face the politicians.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.672
Let's go.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.799
I'm staying.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.677
By yourself? That's not a good idea.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.306
I can't go back without her.
You know that.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.071
Good luck.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.449
Thank you.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.138
Rápido.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.844
I had her, Dad.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.390
In my arms. So close.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.311
I could feel her breathing on my back.

10:10.694 --> 10:11.862
I can imagine.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.787
She's brilliant.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.167
She's the purest soul I ever met.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.757
She's a liar.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.051
She is a liar.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.141
That's a big lie, working for the CIA.

10:43.018 --> 10:47.356
It's not like, you know,
lying about some old boyfriend's big dick.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.280
I don't know how you trust that.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.036
Reminds me of the…

11:05.207 --> 11:11.338
wisdom of one of my mentors, Kenny Rogers.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.176
You got to know when to hold 'em

11:16.260 --> 11:18.345
Know when to fold 'em

11:19.638 --> 11:22.307
Know when to walk away

11:26.103 --> 11:27.896
Know when to run.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.308
Come on.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.603
Go on.

12:13.984 --> 12:14.818
Yeah.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.557
I'm in pain too,
but instead of thinking of that,

12:45.641 --> 12:48.727
all you can do is revert
to your redneck loyalty.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.022
You promised me when we got married
you wouldn't do this shit.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.858
She's got a side thing she's doing
for the Agency down there.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.026
Special status.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.986
I've been all around the world.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.281
You guys are both fucking liars.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.952
They could hold her for 20 years
or they could kill her tomorrow.

13:05.035 --> 13:09.581
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em

13:14.920 --> 13:16.839
Know when to walk away

13:19.758 --> 13:21.301
Know when to run.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.046
All right, talk to me.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.756
So the book on that place

16:04.840 --> 16:08.844
says it's like FedEx for the Venezuelan
drug cartel run by the military.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.263
It's called Cartel de los Soles,
the Cartel of Suns,

16:11.346 --> 16:12.723
which, if you didn't already know,

16:12.806 --> 16:16.018
is run all the way to the top
of the Venezuelan government.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.269
Security is strong.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.396
That's army on the outside
if you haven't already noticed.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.316
Also, I feel the need to point out
that that's where they pay out ELN,

16:22.399 --> 16:23.775
so there's gonna be guerrillas
hanging around.

16:23.859 --> 16:26.153
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Those guys are no joke.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.071
I can knock it over in a couple of months.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.991
How? There's no support
within the administration on this.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.452
The White House
doesn't even wanna hear about her.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.496
They won't engage,
no matter what any of us do.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.374
So, what about Ground Branch?

16:39.458 --> 16:45.297
No appetite. It's gonna sound harsh, man,
but not every problem has a solution.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.466
I'll tell you another problem
without a solution.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.177
When you wake up one morning
with a Glock in your mouth.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.513
You notice I said "Glock," not "cock"?

16:52.596 --> 16:53.722
And let me tell you,

16:53.805 --> 16:57.434
it won't feel good when that bullet opens
up your fucking skull like a watermelon.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.311
That would be very traumatizing
for my husband.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.271
-Oh, yeah.
-Listen, I'm not giving up.

17:01.355 --> 17:05.983
Seventh floor is aware and concerned,
but for the moment, you're on your own.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.214
Shall we order in tonight?

17:28.298 --> 17:29.716
Cleaned up enough messes for one day.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.052
Talk to me.

17:38.517 --> 17:39.518
It's Amber.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.856
They're forcing me to bury her. Bambi too.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.567
What? What do you mean? Where is she?

17:47.568 --> 17:50.863
In some Venezuelan hellhole.
A drug facility.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.199
He's wandering around like a lost dog.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.077
Well, you can't do that.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.956
Amber's our friend.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.918
And Bambi, Jesus Christ, Mitch,
he saved your life.

18:05.002 --> 18:07.546
I mean, you gotta get him outta there.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.965
Come on. It's not some eternal debt.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.345
Pretty sure he can take care of himself.
He's fucking Rambo.

18:21.685 --> 18:25.272
She knew the risks.
It's what she signed up for.

18:26.732 --> 18:30.861
You've known her for 15 years.
Amber's not just a friend. She's family.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.447
I'm just as upset about this as you are.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.033
There's nothing I can do, David.

18:36.825 --> 18:40.704
Is everybody in your life just an asset?

18:41.788 --> 18:42.706
Am I?

18:42.789 --> 18:46.835
Look, I have a job, and my job
is to consider the biggest picture.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.505
And in the big picture,
it's easier if she stays.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.340
I'm sorry to say it, but it is.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.217
Plus, the upside,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.885
from a national security perspective…

18:54.968 --> 18:58.722
the longer she stays in that prison,
the clearer it becomes how awful Maduro is

18:58.805 --> 19:00.140
when it comes to human rights!

19:00.224 --> 19:04.019
And you're being a careerist weasel!

19:04.102 --> 19:07.439
Wow. Must be nice to be able
to take the moral high ground?

19:08.482 --> 19:10.359
Make you feel all warm and cozy inside.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.570
You know, I'd love to be up there too,
but unfortunately, I took an oath.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.822
Yeah. I know all about it.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.324
No, no. You'll listen.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.535
The oath I took for my job?

19:20.619 --> 19:24.289
What was it? Let's see.
Hard to remember. Oh, yeah.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.710
Defend this country against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.004
Bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.881
I take this obligation freely,

19:32.965 --> 19:36.718
without any mental reservation,
et cetera, et cetera, so help me, God.

19:39.638 --> 19:42.641
It doesn't say jack shit in there
about being a good person.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.668
Now I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me or nothing,

20:51.752 --> 20:52.878
but…

20:55.172 --> 20:56.173
I'm not a drunk.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.926
It's okay. Jesus doesn't judge.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.181
I've saved some people.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.393
Lot of people owe their lives.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.064
And they like me.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.662
Are you DEA?

21:29.831 --> 21:32.084
Do I look like I give a shit
about cocaine?

21:38.757 --> 21:39.842
I was a soldier.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.011
-A soldier?
-Long time ago.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.805
What do you do now?

21:50.853 --> 21:52.145
I'm in tourism.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.275
People wanna see the authentic Colombia.

21:57.651 --> 21:58.986
For the sunsets.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.407
Landscapes.

22:05.409 --> 22:07.911
You know, people, they look at this forest

22:07.995 --> 22:12.165
and they go, "How beautiful."
"How beautiful"?

22:14.710 --> 22:18.380
I just see trees and plants,
all fighting each other for the sunlight.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.719
All of them just racing
to the top of the canopy.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.764
And then the slow growers, they just…

22:30.767 --> 22:31.935
die in the shade.

22:32.644 --> 22:36.815
"Let not your hearts
be troubled. Neither let them be afraid."

22:40.402 --> 22:42.446
That's John. Right?

22:43.113 --> 22:44.990
Anyway, it was somewhere, but…

22:46.200 --> 22:47.618
You're a believer.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.121
That's great.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.749
Well, God or the Devil.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.877
Depends which side of the gun
you're on.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.837
You're gonna fucking learn!

23:03.091 --> 23:04.092
I don't know.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.180
I've killed too many men in my life.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.307
Stay fucking down!

23:10.390 --> 23:12.184
I've told you about wearing those shorts!

23:12.267 --> 23:13.268
Shut up!

23:14.811 --> 23:17.147
Stay the fuck down!

23:17.231 --> 23:18.941
See what I'm saying?

23:20.609 --> 23:22.444
I was eight. You know?

23:25.697 --> 23:27.157
You know what?

23:28.242 --> 23:31.245
I'm a pretty good shot.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.415
Wanna know the secret? Repeatability.

23:36.166 --> 23:41.672
You gotta hold the weapon
the exact same way every time.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.634
Fuck it, you're gonna learn now!

23:45.717 --> 23:46.885
You're gonna fucking learn--

23:47.928 --> 23:48.929
Yes.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.060
You're a protector.

23:58.272 --> 24:00.399
Your family must be really happy
to have you.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.368
Let's sleep together.

24:14.413 --> 24:15.956
I should make you a hamburger.

24:32.973 --> 24:33.974
You know what?

24:36.143 --> 24:37.769
I should've played baseball.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.565
I had a 72-mile-an-hour fastball
when I was 14.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.237
That's really good, by the way.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.249
Finish outside.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.212
Go. Go play baseball outside.

25:43.836 --> 25:45.462
Finally.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.093
How did I get here?

27:16.303 --> 27:17.721
I found you in the street.

27:18.931 --> 27:20.641
Well, thank you for rescuing me.

27:23.477 --> 27:26.063
I didn't think I'd made
such a good first impression.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.069
You hungry?

27:37.991 --> 27:38.992
It's…

27:42.037 --> 27:44.581
From my cousin, Javi. He's a fisherman.

27:49.962 --> 27:53.423
"Follow me
and I will make you fishers of men."

28:29.918 --> 28:31.837
Where does he get so much fish?

28:31.920 --> 28:35.549
Next to the bridge,
where the current slows down.

28:36.675 --> 28:37.926
By the big bridge?

28:38.010 --> 28:40.804
Yes, but you can't go there.

28:41.722 --> 28:45.434
Fishermen are very territorial,
especially Javi.

28:59.990 --> 29:00.991
Buenos días.

29:09.374 --> 29:10.375
Buenos días.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.257
This is where I fish, my friend.

29:17.841 --> 29:21.720
You want me to swim over
to the other side and fish from Venezuela?

29:22.971 --> 29:24.515
That's not my problem, man.

29:27.643 --> 29:29.228
Aren't rivers for everyone?

29:32.814 --> 29:34.525
This is where the currents converge.

29:35.901 --> 29:38.695
A man must fish where the fish are.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.580
A man has to be careful.

29:50.707 --> 29:51.875
This is my spot.

29:55.462 --> 30:00.592
Well, how about you take
all the fish that I get,

30:02.261 --> 30:03.846
and you just give me ten dollars?

30:21.238 --> 30:22.489
What's your name?

30:22.573 --> 30:23.574
Javi.

30:26.285 --> 30:27.369
Me llamo Bambi.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.583
It's funny, right?

30:33.458 --> 30:34.877
I'm gonna make you rich.

30:35.502 --> 30:37.504
Rich? How?

30:38.046 --> 30:39.131
-How?
-Yeah.

30:40.716 --> 30:41.758
With money.

30:44.678 --> 30:45.679
Good.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.266
-See you tomorrow.
-Mañana.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.518
Mañana, amigo.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.662
Okay.

31:10.746 --> 31:11.830
Do you know what?

31:11.914 --> 31:15.334
-What? Tell me.
-Cumbia is the best music in the world.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.385
Look at this.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.425
-Salud.
-Good. Good job.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.226
Let's have beer.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.883
We got five million in
the campaign exploratory account.

32:45.966 --> 32:48.177
That's ten times what anybody else has.

32:48.260 --> 32:51.388
We got some heavy hitters coming in.
Lot of White House experience.

32:51.471 --> 32:52.848
You're gonna have big guns behind you.

32:52.931 --> 32:53.932
Right. Good.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.685
What's the matter?
Your head still in Colombia?

32:57.144 --> 32:58.937
I know you gotta be torn up inside.

32:59.021 --> 33:00.147
Let's not do that.

33:00.230 --> 33:02.107
-What?
-Talk about emotion.

33:02.191 --> 33:03.192
Okay, tough guy.

33:04.401 --> 33:08.530
But you need to understand
she is not coming out. Ever.

33:08.614 --> 33:09.781
We did the research.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.867
I spoke to the White House.

33:11.950 --> 33:17.748
It is very sad. I liked her a lot,
but she is not coming home.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.836
Well, now it's time
to move to the grown-ups' table

33:22.920 --> 33:27.049
and make some decisions about your life
before life makes the decisions for you.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.426
I'll do my best to make you happy.

33:31.595 --> 33:32.804
Christ.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.725
When did you get so cynical?

33:37.309 --> 33:39.770
I don't know. Maybe at Harvard.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.899
It's fine. I just wanted to be clear.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.276
No, maybe you're right.

33:47.110 --> 33:50.989
Maybe everybody's just,
you know, operating out of self-interest.

33:51.073 --> 33:53.075
Maybe family is just some…

33:53.158 --> 33:58.330
sentimental construct to justify some
heartless animal kingdom crap.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.834
Maybe real love doesn't exist at all,
but I want you to remember,

34:01.917 --> 34:04.795
I taught you how to wipe your own ass.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.798
I had your shit on my fingers.

34:07.881 --> 34:11.426
And if you think that wasn't out of love,
you need to grow the fuck up.

34:12.719 --> 34:16.014
Cynicism is a refuge
for the young and the childless.

34:25.399 --> 34:26.567
Too much?

34:27.818 --> 34:28.819
No.

34:30.654 --> 34:33.657
Senator,
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.

34:34.157 --> 34:35.993
Outside of the development team,

34:36.076 --> 34:37.995
you're gonna be
the first to know about this.

34:38.078 --> 34:41.039
-If you don't like it, I'll be devastated.
-Well, it's not up to me.

34:41.123 --> 34:43.417
Let's see where the warfighters put it
on their list of priorities.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.043
Speaking of which, we have one right here.

34:45.127 --> 34:46.335
-He's not the Joint Chiefs…
-Senator.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.130
…but he knows the truth on the ground.

34:48.213 --> 34:51.717
I wasn't expecting to see you.
We're all very sorry for your loss.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.801
Thank you.

34:52.885 --> 34:54.844
I had an epiphany this morning
about politics,

34:54.928 --> 34:57.054
and I wanted you
to be the first to hear about it.

34:57.139 --> 35:01.852
My father-- dad,
does not know what I'm about to say.

35:01.935 --> 35:03.270
I'm intrigued.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.233
I've been exploring a run
for the Senate seat opening up.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.612
Could we talk about your support?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.614
I would love to talk to you about it.

35:13.697 --> 35:18.452
That's how you make history, kids.
Got a future president here.

35:18.535 --> 35:20.412
Senator, I know your time is short.

35:20.495 --> 35:21.955
Reese, wanna kick it off?

35:22.497 --> 35:26.126
Senator, may we introduce you to Ulysses?

35:45.312 --> 35:47.022
"You feel it in your bones.

35:47.814 --> 35:50.901
When that call comes in,
it's the tone of voice,

35:50.984 --> 35:53.278
and you know something bad has happened.

35:54.446 --> 35:58.700
When you hear,
'Your wife has been kidnapped.'

36:00.702 --> 36:03.163
And it has shattered your core,

36:03.997 --> 36:07.793
and makes you mad at God, and you say,
'How can God be good?'"

36:09.044 --> 36:11.713
And then you segue.
People like vulnerability.

36:11.797 --> 36:16.593
"And you take the lessons
that life has given you.

36:17.219 --> 36:18.428
Everybody has loss.

36:19.555 --> 36:22.349
Some people's loss is worse than yours.

36:22.432 --> 36:26.728
I think about a woman who's lost her child
because of substandard medical care,

36:26.812 --> 36:29.273
and I know that I wanna fight her fight."

36:30.315 --> 36:35.946
"And along with that is the importance
of stronger national security.

36:36.822 --> 36:41.577
Americans should be free
to travel safely all around the globe.

36:42.411 --> 36:47.124
And when anyone threatens that,
they should fear our wrath."

36:49.209 --> 36:52.254
Make it your own, of course,
but something like that.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.492
Hey, Boss. You got a sec?

37:25.704 --> 37:27.039
Got a confession to make.

37:27.539 --> 37:28.832
You got five minutes.

37:29.416 --> 37:32.461
So, our hero gets picked up
by jungle bros we know are ELN.

37:32.544 --> 37:34.254
Okay, you can assume I paid attention.

37:34.338 --> 37:38.675
Right. They drop her off in this
facility run by the Venezuelan military.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.677
That suggests to me
they consider her a keeper.

37:40.761 --> 37:44.431
Chit for sanctions, propaganda.
Maybe they don't know yet.

37:44.515 --> 37:46.892
So, what's your confession?

37:47.518 --> 37:52.648
Well, Amber's been good to the Agency,
and I'm personally tight with her brother.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.858
He's done a lot of favors for us in Iraq.

37:54.942 --> 37:57.569
On the one hand, we have loyalty
and our integrity as human beings.

37:58.195 --> 38:00.906
On the other hand, the price of loyalty,
in this case, is very high.

38:00.989 --> 38:03.200
So there's an upside
to cutting ties right now.

38:03.283 --> 38:05.118
But I still don't see how it's my problem.

38:05.202 --> 38:06.954
Well, I'm trying one last idea.

38:08.539 --> 38:10.749
We could help Bambi knock the place over.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.961
Don't put any of this on my desk.

39:53.101 --> 39:54.102
Hey.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.472
It's not a good time.

40:32.516 --> 40:33.934
You're scared. It's cool.

40:40.941 --> 40:41.942
Can I be rough?

40:42.025 --> 40:43.360
I don't know, can you?

40:44.862 --> 40:47.322
Is it "yes," or is it "no"?

40:48.532 --> 40:49.616
Yeah.

40:59.042 --> 41:00.043
I changed my mind.

41:01.420 --> 41:04.256
What the fuck are we doing?
This is bullshit.

41:06.550 --> 41:07.551
It's not.

41:08.719 --> 41:11.263
I was pretty clear about my motivations.

41:12.097 --> 41:15.475
You're going through a lot 'cause
you're injured and your wife's in hell,

41:15.559 --> 41:18.770
and that, I'm here to be
the companion in the hard times.

41:18.854 --> 41:21.899
Well, thank you, but I don't need it.

41:23.775 --> 41:24.985
And I don't want it.

41:26.403 --> 41:29.489
What about me? What about what I want?

41:36.079 --> 41:39.082
-You're so handsome.
-Jesus.

41:39.166 --> 41:40.667
-Do you always do that?
-What?

41:40.751 --> 41:43.086
Just push away compliments?

41:43.170 --> 41:45.839
When they spring from ulterior motives,
yeah.

41:47.799 --> 41:50.135
Handsome but so sensitive.

41:50.219 --> 41:52.304
Trust me, nobody has ever said that.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.810
Well, maybe the people in your
life don't really see you for who you are.

41:59.311 --> 42:02.940
I'm an outside observer here, but yeah,
you're sensitive,

42:03.899 --> 42:06.610
and you're just trying really hard
not to show it.

42:08.153 --> 42:12.908
Come on. Empathy. Psychological insight.

42:15.118 --> 42:18.038
And now I'm literally on my knees for you.

42:20.624 --> 42:23.710
You have to admit,
it's a pretty strong offer.
