00:05.250 --> 00:06.620
Previously on Shadowhunters...

00:06.620 --> 00:08.250
Jace is trapped in his own
personal hell, and I can't

00:08.250 --> 00:10.250
get him out.
Alec... I need you to kill me.

00:10.250 --> 00:11.620
There's still a way
for me to obtain

00:11.620 --> 00:13.040
enough power to cure him.
What is it?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.620
My father.
Asmodeus.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.000
Any vampire will feed
if they're hungry enough...

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
and your son is starving.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.830
No, Simon!
Simon!

00:21.830 --> 00:23.210
You get away from her!

00:23.210 --> 00:25.330
I swear to God, I will kill you!

00:25.330 --> 00:27.250
Please, you have to destroy
Valentine's body.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.330
What are you doing?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.250
My queen needs
Valentine's flesh

00:31.250 --> 00:32.080
and your heart.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.880
For thousands of years,
I was unable to bear a child,

00:35.880 --> 00:39.380
but then Valentine asked for
my blood for his unborn son.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.880
He sent him to me.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.420
MAKE IT STOP!

00:43.420 --> 00:45.210
YOU MADE ME THIS WAY!

00:45.210 --> 00:48.620
DAD!

01:20.040 --> 01:21.080
My precious boy...

01:23.040 --> 01:24.290
Stay away from me!

01:24.290 --> 01:25.790
It's all right.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.920
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.620
See? I'm just like you.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.000
Who are you?

01:36.380 --> 01:37.710
I am your mother.

01:39.210 --> 01:42.120
I'm so happy your father
finally sent you to me.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.620
My mother hates me.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.500
That's why she left us.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.830
That woman who abandoned you,

01:50.830 --> 01:53.670
Jocelyn Fairchild,
is not your true mother.

01:53.670 --> 01:55.880
My blood...

01:55.880 --> 01:57.710
is what made you so special...

01:57.710 --> 02:00.290
so powerful.

02:00.290 --> 02:03.000
And your father
punished you for it,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.460
but I won't...

02:04.460 --> 02:06.880
because I know

02:06.880 --> 02:09.330
what a gift you are
to this world.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.460
I love you more than anything.

What's the point?

Did you?!

Answer me!

I don't take orders from you.

Please.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.080

04:08.080 --> 04:09.540
I can't lose him again.

There is no version of this

04:12.880 --> 04:15.500

04:17.330 --> 04:18.540
Jace, if you can
hear me in there,

04:18.540 --> 04:21.080
I will never give up on you.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.380
Never.

04:29.540 --> 04:33.460
The life you knew is gone.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.210
You belong to Lilith now.

: Forgive me, ma'am,
if I misheard you,

04:40.670 --> 04:42.330
but did you say
that your daughter

04:42.330 --> 04:43.620
was attacked by a vampire?

04:43.620 --> 04:44.880
Yes!

04:44.880 --> 04:46.500
I did, and I know
how that sounds.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.460
But it's the truth.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.710
And then these friends
of his showed up

04:51.710 --> 04:53.210
and helped him escape, and he--

04:53.210 --> 04:54.210
Let's go find a coffee.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.580
No, no! I need to stay here

04:55.580 --> 04:57.250
with my daughter.
Ms. Lewis, she's in good hands,

04:57.250 --> 04:58.500
and fresh air will
do you some good.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.460
(INDISTINCT SPEAKING

05:00.460 --> 05:02.920
People are gonna
think she's insane.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.170
This isn't your fault.
How is any of this not my fault?

05:05.170 --> 05:06.710
I've ruined her life.

05:06.710 --> 05:08.170
I'm sorry.

05:08.170 --> 05:11.540
Can you ask
your doctor boyfriend

05:11.540 --> 05:13.210
to check in on Becky?

05:13.210 --> 05:15.920
He never quite made it
to "boyfriend."

05:17.210 --> 05:18.670
Oh.
I got tired of lying.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.420
Mundanes and the Shadow World
don't mix.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.250
You're preaching to the choir.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.250
Excuse me, miss. Paramedics came
in with Rebecca Lewis.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.830
Where is she?
Are you family?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.250
Yeah, she's my sister.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.960
Thank you.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.420
:
Dr. Smith to radiology, please.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.540
Dr. Smith to radiology.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.960
Give me something...

06:09.960 --> 06:11.210
Anything that makes sense

06:11.210 --> 06:12.710
of why you were
found on the street

06:12.710 --> 06:14.210
with a crossbow
and rappelling gear.

06:14.210 --> 06:16.500
Look, last time I checked,
having a hobby wasn't a crime.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.170
No, but obstruction
of justice is.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.540
Obstruction

06:19.540 --> 06:21.710
You know, hopefully you're
just covering for your partner

06:21.710 --> 06:23.210
who may or may not
have skipped town

06:23.210 --> 06:25.250
after murdering her own mother.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.120
Ollie is innocent.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.580
If she's so innocent,

06:30.580 --> 06:32.420
why were her prints found
on the murder weapon?

06:33.380 --> 06:34.460
Maybe you should be
asking yourself

06:34.460 --> 06:36.120
why somebody would want
to frame her instead.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.540
According to Internal Affairs,
that answer's staring me

06:38.540 --> 06:39.880
in the face right now.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.290
They're looking at you for what
happened to Wilson's mom...

06:43.290 --> 06:45.670
and a few other deaths too.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.170
Based on what evidence?

06:47.170 --> 06:48.420
Other than what we
just went over?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.500
How about the disappearance
of your last partner?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.710
Huh?

06:52.710 --> 06:55.920
Or my predecessor
who died on the job

06:55.920 --> 06:58.250
while you were investigating
the Demonic Murders.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.830
I put that suspect
in the morgue.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.040
Then where's the body?

07:02.620 --> 07:04.670
Or did your perp just
get up and walk away?

07:04.670 --> 07:06.210
You're gonna have to take
that up with the coroner.

07:06.210 --> 07:08.920
Look, Lieutenant, I'm sorry
but my daughter needs me.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
I gotta go.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.250
Oh, your daughter?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.670
You mean the one
that vanished from existence?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.540
It's been hundreds of years
since you banished your father.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.620
What makes you think he'll
even listen to your request?

07:26.830 --> 07:28.500
Let's just say he owes me one.

07:32.380 --> 07:33.710
For what happened
with your mother?

07:33.710 --> 07:35.620
That...

07:35.620 --> 07:37.540
and for everything
in the years that followed.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.380
I was living on the streets.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.620
I didn't know who or what I was.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.830
Asmodeus took me in.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.540
Nurtured my darker impulses.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.170
And taught me the "proper" way
to be a warlock.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.290
And why'd you listen to him?

08:03.790 --> 08:06.460
Because he was the only one
in the world with eyes like me.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.210
He was my father.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.920
Look, at least give me
the time to call in back-up

08:16.920 --> 08:18.620
from the Institute.
We don't even have Lilith

08:18.620 --> 08:20.710
under control.
Another Greater Demon

08:20.710 --> 08:22.330
gets loose, it could put
the whole city at risk.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.920
Fortunately for the good
people of New York,

08:24.920 --> 08:27.710
my father won't be
traveling top-side.

08:28.790 --> 08:29.790
What aren't you telling me?

08:32.540 --> 08:35.250
This pentagram isn't
for summoning Asmodeus to Earth.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.170
It's for sending
someone to Edom.

08:38.170 --> 08:40.710
In this case, me.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.330
Absolutely not.

08:42.330 --> 08:44.120
We need my father's help.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.000
And the cell service
down there is terrible.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.750
This isn't funny!

08:47.750 --> 08:50.330
Would you prefer I act as
terrified as I feel right now?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.330
This is insane.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.960
Tell me Jace isn't worth it.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.170
Let's get this over with.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.830
You're gonna make it back.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.790
You hear me?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.080
Why wouldn't I?

09:22.290 --> 09:23.830
Look what I have waiting for me.

09:40.670 --> 09:41.880
I love you, Alexander.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.210
I love you too.

10:32.420 --> 10:33.710
Come on. It's not
much farther now.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.250
That's what you said
10 blocks ago.

10:40.750 --> 10:41.710
Get up.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.620
Just give me a minute.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.710
I haven't stopped moving
since Valentine's interrogation.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.120
Stop moving. You're gonna
need your stamina.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.880
Let's go.

11:28.290 --> 11:29.420
Becky...

11:29.420 --> 11:31.080
Hey, I'm here.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.420
Are you OK?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.250
Simon...

11:38.960 --> 11:40.210
It's a hell of a hangover.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.080
What happened?

11:58.210 --> 11:59.750
Did you do this to Mom too?

12:01.170 --> 12:03.880
No. It didn't come to that.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.250
I am so sorry.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.120
I've read enough YA
to know what happens.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.960
So, how long is it until I turn?

12:16.960 --> 12:18.460
You won't. I promise.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.670
You'd have to have died
with my blood in your system,

12:21.670 --> 12:23.880
then get buried, and then...

12:23.880 --> 12:25.080
um...

12:26.290 --> 12:29.620
...feed as soon as you crawled
out of your own grave.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
Oh, Simon...

12:34.880 --> 12:37.210
You went through
all of that alone?

12:38.880 --> 12:39.830
You died?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.460
Medically speaking, yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.040
Well, I guess...

12:46.040 --> 12:47.830
all of your sketchy behaviour

12:47.830 --> 12:49.170
makes more sense now.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.620
How did I not know
about this sooner?

12:54.880 --> 12:56.710
You and Mom both did.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.670
I had a vampire friend
hypnotize both of you to forget.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.750
Oh...

13:05.500 --> 13:06.880
Can you do that too?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.170
Yeah.

13:08.170 --> 13:09.710
And I...

13:09.710 --> 13:11.210
I will totally do
that for you too.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.420
No!

13:13.960 --> 13:15.420
No.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.290
Simon, I wasn't there
for you once.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.830
And I will never
not be there for you again.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.290
I'm your big sister...

13:30.290 --> 13:32.420
and I'm always gonna love you.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.250
Warts, fangs and all.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.670
Oh...

13:42.670 --> 13:44.210
Oh.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.000
How did Mom take this?

13:47.420 --> 13:48.920
She tried to kill me.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.080
And now, she's telling everybody

13:51.080 --> 13:52.620
about what I really am.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.500
What do we do about that?

14:22.880 --> 14:26.330
Who dares enter the lair
of Asmodeus unannounced?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.750
Be still my beating heart.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.040
Is that my beautiful boy...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.250
...or do my eyes deceive me?

14:59.290 --> 15:01.040
Hello, Father.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.790
My son.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.380
Magnus Bane.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.620
High Warlock of Greenwich...

15:18.920 --> 15:21.540
...here in Edom.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.170
Not that it matters anymore,

15:23.170 --> 15:25.710
but I was the High Warlock
of Brooklyn,

15:25.710 --> 15:27.120
not Greenwich.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.960
Well, you'll have to forgive me
for being out of touch.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.750
It's not like you write.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.500
Or call.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.000
Or perform the occasional
blood sacrifice.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.830
Well, you'll have to forgive me,

15:39.830 --> 15:42.500
considering how we left things.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.000
I can only assume
that your presence here

15:45.000 --> 15:47.460
means you've finally
come to your senses.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.120
About what?

15:49.120 --> 15:52.380
Banishing the only person
who ever truly cared for you.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.750
You think I came here
to apologize?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.750
A demon can hope, can't he?

16:00.420 --> 16:03.170
I plucked you from obscurity

16:03.170 --> 16:05.290
and poverty,

16:05.290 --> 16:07.170
and turned you into the man
that you are today.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.460
I'm the man I am today
because I finally saw you

16:09.460 --> 16:11.290
for what you really are...

16:11.290 --> 16:13.330
a prince of Hell.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.000
You didn't seem to mind
at the time.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.250
I didn't know any better!

16:19.250 --> 16:20.830
There isn't a single thing

16:20.830 --> 16:23.330
from our years together
that doesn't make my skin crawl.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.000
I'm sorry to burst your bubble,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.790
but... you'll get
no apology from me.

16:31.170 --> 16:32.420
Then why have you come here?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.460
Why re

16:40.250 --> 16:43.420
I came here to ask you
for your assistance.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.210
A FAVOUR?!

16:46.210 --> 16:48.830
After coming into my home
and insulting me like this?!

16:48.830 --> 16:51.170
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

16:56.420 --> 16:59.250
The kind whose love
for his chosen son

16:59.250 --> 17:01.120
might outweigh his pride.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.040
You know, you can stall
all you want, Luke,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.080
but you're going to have to give
a statement sooner or later.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.790
Look, Lieutenant, I don't
have time for this.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.540
If you have evidence, I'm more
than happy to call my union rep.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.040
Don't do this.
Otherwise, I'm out the door.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.500
Don't push me.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.420
I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.790
Then you're suspended
pending further investigation.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.210
I've been calling you
for an hour.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.420
What was that all about?

17:44.420 --> 17:46.170
A problem for another day.
What's up?

17:46.170 --> 17:48.750
Lilith just used Jace
to break Clary out of the Gard.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.040
What

17:50.040 --> 17:51.540
Remember that image
Simon sent you?

17:51.540 --> 17:52.920
The ritual markings
from Lilith's church.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.210
What about them?
Whatever the ritual is,

17:54.210 --> 17:56.080
Clary's a part of it.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.380
How?
I don't know.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.420
Alec just got a tracking hit
on her. It's faint, but she's

17:59.420 --> 18:01.580
definitely back in the city.
All right.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.710
Let's go find her.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.170
The prodigal sister has arrived.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.250
The family resemblance
is striking.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.420
To tell the truth,
I just don't see it.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.960
You're a sassy one, aren't you?

18:35.960 --> 18:38.120
Sorry for the delay, my Queen.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.500
Valentine's rib.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.830
All that matters is we have

18:45.830 --> 18:47.960
everything necessary to begin.

19:06.290 --> 19:09.120
My Owl is going
to need his energy.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.250
Thank you, my Queen.

19:26.420 --> 19:27.420
Leave.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.330
Oh...

19:33.330 --> 19:35.210
Anger isn't a good look on you.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.080
Neither are those clothes.

19:39.210 --> 19:42.250
Get her cleaned up
and into a change of clothes

19:42.250 --> 19:44.420
for her brother's rebirth.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.000
Perhaps something blue.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
That's what your kind wears
when the lost return, isn't it?

20:06.420 --> 20:07.420
Mom...

20:12.040 --> 20:13.920
No, no, no. It's OK.
Please, don't kill me.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.290
I'm all your sister has left.
No, it's OK.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.540
It's OK.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.080
I know...

20:22.080 --> 20:24.290
I know how hard it was
for you to lose Dad,

20:24.290 --> 20:26.380
but...

20:26.380 --> 20:28.330
but what I'm about to do, it...

20:28.330 --> 20:30.210
it has to happen. It has
to happen for your own good.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.290
Don't. Don't. Don't panic.
Please, don't.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.500
Sh. Sh.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.250
Just... relax.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.380
Just listen.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.790
Your son, Simon...

20:46.790 --> 20:48.420
he isn't a vampire.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.080
That's just how you're
dealing with your grief.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.460
There was an accident.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.500
But your son felt no pain.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.040
And in his last moments...

21:08.960 --> 21:10.500
In his last moments, he thought

21:10.500 --> 21:12.380
about how much he's
gonna miss you.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.170
The things we do
for our children.

22:36.170 --> 22:39.540
Besides, the mundanes
killed by my disciples

22:39.540 --> 22:41.460
will do far more for this world

22:41.460 --> 22:43.500
in death than they'd
ever do in life.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.920
And yet you need me alive.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.000
How does that work, exactly?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.670
I mean, you can't really
just borrow my heart.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.000
Oh, I'm afraid that's
exactly what it's like.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.670
But the heart isn't
what you think.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.790
Jonathan needs to share
your life force

22:56.790 --> 22:59.000
in order to breathe again,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.080
so I might hold him once more.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.790
Losing Jonathan...

23:03.790 --> 23:07.170
hearing him call for me
with his final breath...

23:08.120 --> 23:12.290
...was the single most painful
moment of my very long life.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.460
You say that like you loved him.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.620
Why wouldn't I?

23:20.710 --> 23:22.580
Demons aren't capable of love.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.830
A failing of frail
human imagination.

23:29.290 --> 23:32.540
Demons live. We die.
We feed. We lay.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.500
Why wouldn't we love like you?

23:35.500 --> 23:36.920
I need to care for Jonathan

23:36.920 --> 23:38.960
like you and your father
never would.

23:40.580 --> 23:41.670
If there's one thing

23:41.670 --> 23:43.580
that Valentine and I
can agree on,

23:43.580 --> 23:45.580
it's the fact that the world
is a much better place

23:45.580 --> 23:48.250
with a monster like Jonathan
dead and buried.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.620
My son is not a monster!

24:08.580 --> 24:10.920
Just little demonic power
to help free my friend,

24:10.920 --> 24:12.380
that's all I'm asking for.

24:13.540 --> 24:16.670
Why would I ever
give you the means

24:16.670 --> 24:19.380
by which Lilith could
be banished back here

24:19.380 --> 24:21.500
to lord over us all?

24:22.750 --> 24:24.710
Edom may not be Marseille,

24:24.710 --> 24:27.500
but it's a hell of a lot less
miserable with her gone.

24:32.710 --> 24:34.250
Name your price.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.880
"There is a time

24:40.880 --> 24:43.210
"when we all must return

24:43.210 --> 24:45.580
to live in the houses
of our fathers."

24:47.580 --> 24:49.330
Rule beside me.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.120
I never should have come.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.330
Say what you will about the time
we spent together,

24:55.330 --> 24:57.920
but you have to admit,
you enjoyed every minute of it.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.500
I was a child!

25:04.620 --> 25:06.420
Father...

25:06.420 --> 25:08.750
I have never once come here
to ask you for anything.

25:08.750 --> 25:12.500
There must be something else
I can give you.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.290
Actually, my son...

25:18.290 --> 25:19.960
there is.

25:26.380 --> 25:29.620
Maryse... you deserved to know
what was happening with Jace.

25:29.620 --> 25:30.880
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.750
"A problem for another day."

25:32.750 --> 25:35.080
Do you think Clary
was actually here?

25:36.960 --> 25:39.170
Yes.
Jace's or Clary's?

25:44.540 --> 25:47.620
Clary's. It's probably
what set off Alec's tracking.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.210
Look...

25:55.710 --> 25:57.120
Do you think Jace
did this to her?

25:58.540 --> 26:00.420
Clary might have
done this to herself.

26:01.710 --> 26:03.170
She's leaving us bread crumbs.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.290
Lilith's hiding
in a mundane building?

26:09.170 --> 26:10.620
The trail led us here.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.540
She's trying to put
as many bodies as possible

26:12.540 --> 26:14.670
between her and anyone
with a mind to stop her.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.250
]

26:16.250 --> 26:17.670
We might be on our own.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.080
I'm sure Magnus is just waiting

26:21.080 --> 26:22.790
to make some sort
of dramatic entrance.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.080
Yeah...

26:24.080 --> 26:25.880
Let's hope so.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.420
Thanks for the intel.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.670
I'll call Izzy. She and Simon

26:28.670 --> 26:30.000
Bring me a blade.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.250
Mom... I'm gonna ask you
to sit this one out.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.120
Against the Queen of Hell?!

26:34.120 --> 26:35.790
[You're gonna need
all the help you can get.]

26:35.790 --> 26:37.460
Please, Mom, for me.

26:39.210 --> 26:40.330
Let us do the heavy lifting.

26:41.710 --> 26:43.000
We pull this off,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.380
Jace is gonna need you.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.710
I know the timing sucks,
but we need you.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.790
Lilith has Clary.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.580
No...
And the one thing

27:09.580 --> 27:11.920
aside from Clary's Sunlight rune
that has proven to work

27:11.920 --> 27:13.080
against Lilith's disciples--

27:13.080 --> 27:14.250
My mark...

27:14.250 --> 27:15.880
which Heidi somehow knew about.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.120
I thought... I thought
the Seelie Queen told her,

27:18.120 --> 27:19.290
but what if...

27:19.290 --> 27:20.710
what if Lilith freed Heidi?

27:20.710 --> 27:22.920
Simon, if you can't do this,

27:22.920 --> 27:24.210
everyone will understand.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.460
OK?
No! No.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.290
I just lost my mom.

27:28.290 --> 27:29.540
I'm not losing Clary too.

27:33.460 --> 27:34.880
ALEC: Simon's been
in the building forever.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.080
What's taking him so long?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.750
Alec, it's a high rise.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.580
Sorry. I tried to get
as close as I could

27:40.580 --> 27:41.960
without anyone noticing, but...

27:42.960 --> 27:44.790
...my vamp ears couldn't
hear Clary inside anywhere.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.460
Lilith must be
concealing her location

27:46.460 --> 27:47.580
with some kind of glamour.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.790
Let's find out.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.830
What does that one do?

27:50.830 --> 27:54.120
Spiritum. It allows us to see
currents of supernatural energy.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.210
So, if we can't see
the shark in the ocean,

27:56.210 --> 27:57.790
...you can still see
the waves it makes.

28:09.330 --> 28:11.420
Lilith has portal wards
on the perimeter...

28:16.540 --> 28:19.080
...and she's redirected
ley lines to the top floor.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.920
I've never seen
magic that strong.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.750
With or without Magnus,

28:26.750 --> 28:27.880
we have to get Clary
out of there.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.080
Look, Lilith's gonna throw
everything she has at us,

28:30.080 --> 28:31.380
including Jace.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.500
For the record, I'd rather
not vaporize Jace

28:34.500 --> 28:36.330
if he tries to kill me,
but I can't control

28:36.330 --> 28:37.960
how this thing works,
or the fact that he'll

28:37.960 --> 28:39.540
probably try to kill me
during the fight.

28:39.540 --> 28:40.830
That's a good point.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.920
I have another way
you can be helpful.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.080
What am I gonna do
with a steely?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.170
Stele.

28:47.170 --> 28:48.380
I've heard it both ways.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.210
The fire alarm just
went off downstairs.

28:59.210 --> 29:01.380
The mundanes are
evacuating the building.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.210
There's no fire.

29:03.210 --> 29:05.880
Luke Garroway is leading a
strike team from the Institute.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.540
Is the Daylighter with them?

29:08.540 --> 29:09.750
Why do you care if Simon's here?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.580
Keep them away from my boy.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.790
Avoid the vampire.
Kill the rest.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.960
LUKE: Remember, you see
any Disciples,

29:29.960 --> 29:33.000
stay non-lethal. We might be
able to restore them eventually.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.040
Zero body count is gonna
be a lot easier

29:35.040 --> 29:36.920
without any mundanes in the way.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.460
Looks like the plan's
working so far.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.830
Building's been
emptied out on our end.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.000
All clear back here. Heading to
meet the fire department.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.250
Looks like security's
the last one out.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.880
Which means we've got
about five minutes

29:51.880 --> 29:54.040
before emergency response
gets in the way.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.670
Here's to hoping Lilith
has a short fuse.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.000
How do we know
if she takes the bait?

30:01.460 --> 30:02.670
Call it a hunch.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.960
Careful.

30:10.960 --> 30:11.880
He's still in here.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.290
And he's prepared to die for it.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.790
I won't hesitate
to fulfill that wish.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.710
I could kill you
with my magic right now...

30:23.710 --> 30:26.330
but I'd rather make Jace watch

30:26.330 --> 30:28.830
as I tear you apart
with his hands.

30:45.290 --> 30:46.920
Hey there... Partner.

30:56.460 --> 30:57.960
You really think
that can hurt me?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.420
Only one way to find out.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.670
AGH!

31:52.500 --> 31:53.880
AGH!

32:23.080 --> 32:24.750
Your boy is crying, you know.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.420
He's begging me...

32:32.420 --> 32:34.580
begging me not to do this.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.210
Jace...

32:42.210 --> 32:43.710
I know you're in there...

32:46.790 --> 32:48.120
It's OK.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.080
I forgive you.

32:51.290 --> 32:52.880
It wasn't you.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.080
I'm sorry we couldn't save you.

32:59.250 --> 33:01.420
They say the worst pain
a Shadowhunter can feel

33:01.420 --> 33:03.000
is the loss of his parabatai.

33:04.830 --> 33:05.960
Come here.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.710
It's time for Jace
to finally feel it.

33:10.290 --> 33:11.830
ALEC!

33:20.170 --> 33:21.460
NO!

33:39.120 --> 33:40.460
Stay with me!

34:05.880 --> 34:08.500
Mom said... you'd make
a dramatic entrance.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.420
Wise woman.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.120
Alec! Alec!

34:19.290 --> 34:20.620
Magnus, please, you've
gotta fix him!

34:21.670 --> 34:22.790
I can't.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.250
You can't?! What do you
mean you can't?

34:25.250 --> 34:26.460
My magic...

34:28.500 --> 34:30.620
...it's gone.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.960
I traded it to break
Lilith's hold on you.

34:43.420 --> 34:46.210
Jace... it wasn't you.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.080
I'll take care of him.

35:02.790 --> 35:04.580
I'm going to get Clary.

35:06.210 --> 35:07.290
Jace is coming for you.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.830
They all are.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.080
Let them.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.290
I bet Jonathan can't wait

35:19.290 --> 35:20.500
to see them again.

35:32.580 --> 35:34.460
As you live,

35:34.460 --> 35:36.460
so shall my son.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.000
OH!

36:18.620 --> 36:19.620
RISE!

36:36.750 --> 36:38.170
How are we gonna
take care of those guys?

36:39.170 --> 36:40.420
We just have to buy
Simon some time.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.290
Hey! Miss me?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.420
Let's get the hell out of here!

37:06.420 --> 37:07.330
No, wait! No!

37:07.330 --> 37:09.750
We can't let her bring
my brother back to life.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.540
Sebastian?
Jonathan.

37:11.540 --> 37:12.420
Two brothers?
Same guy.

37:12.420 --> 37:14.380
Oh. Cool, cool, cool.
OK. So, what's the play?

37:15.380 --> 37:16.750
Lilith is afraid
of that mark on your head.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.330
But it's defensive, not
offensive. We'd have to get her

37:18.330 --> 37:19.920
to make a run at me, but she's
smarter than that, isn't she?

37:21.210 --> 37:22.750
Not when it comes
to her son, she isn't.

37:22.750 --> 37:23.750
OK.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.420
I need a stele.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.420
Uh...

37:26.420 --> 37:27.830
Alec thought you might say that.

37:47.330 --> 37:48.250
CLARY'S ON THE TOP FLOOR!

37:58.080 --> 37:59.830
Get away from Jonathan!

38:04.420 --> 38:05.790
Why would I do that?

38:09.960 --> 38:12.790
"As I live, so shall your son."

38:14.580 --> 38:15.750
You wouldn't.

38:27.710 --> 38:29.210
Foolish child!

38:29.210 --> 38:30.380
SIMON, NOW!

38:32.380 --> 38:33.580
Do it, Simon!

38:33.580 --> 38:34.540
End this!

38:39.380 --> 38:40.540
NO!

38:58.750 --> 39:00.420
NO!

39:11.540 --> 39:12.880
NO!
