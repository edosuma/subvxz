WEBVTT

00:06.774 --> 00:08.242
- Oh, this dress?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.078
Thank you, Dylan, I actually
got it last weekend,

00:10.178 --> 00:13.281
and thanks for the compliment,
but I'm not that pretty.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.583
- Okay, now that
Locker Dylan's into you,

00:15.683 --> 00:18.986
try talking
to the actual Dylan.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.155
- I can't--he's too cute.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.757
Besides, I got a good thing
going with Locker Dylan now,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.726
and I don't want
to mess that up.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.829
- Stop it--you've been
crushing on him for two weeks.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.831
Just go talk to him!
- About what?

00:30.931 --> 00:33.334
I don't even know if we
have anything in common.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.369
- It's too bad you can't
just go through his backpack

00:35.469 --> 00:37.471
and see what he's into.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.673
- Or can I?

00:42.910 --> 00:47.047
- Delivery for Max
Thunder--[screams]

00:47.148 --> 00:49.450
- I'll sign for that.

00:49.550 --> 00:53.287
Max Thunder--[screams]maaaan!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.425
Thanks, buddy.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.759
Oh.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.229
- Wait--you're getting your
deliveries at school now?

01:01.329 --> 01:03.397
- Yeah, Dad took away
my mail privileges.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.334
You banish one mailman
into a black hole...

01:06.434 --> 01:09.703
but he had it coming.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.905
- There's my backpack.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.377
- Here, let me help you out
with that, Actual Dylan...

01:16.477 --> 01:19.180
uh, Dylan.
- Thanks.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.849
Phoebe, right?
- Yeah.

01:21.949 --> 01:25.953
Uh, here, you
forgot your... diaper?

01:26.053 --> 01:30.023
- Don't worry, it's clean...
and not mine.

01:30.158 --> 01:33.861
- Wow... nice, funny,
and potty-trained.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.929
Triple threat!

01:36.029 --> 01:37.865
- It's my baby brother's.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.667
I have to pick him up
from daycare after school.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.834
- You have a little brother?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.171
I have a little
brother and sister!

01:43.204 --> 01:46.874
Look at us... having
things in common.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.310
- Do you take him to the park
every day after school, too?

01:49.410 --> 01:52.913
- Psh, no... yes!

01:53.013 --> 01:56.250
Do you go to the park near...

01:56.350 --> 01:59.187
- The Community Center.
- That's the one.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.089
- Maybe I'll, uh, see
you at the park today.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.825
- It's a date... a play date.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.894
For the kids.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.098
- [gasps]

02:11.199 --> 02:12.966
- BOTH: [squealing]

02:13.066 --> 02:16.270
- Oh, my gosh, you did
it--that was awesome!

02:16.370 --> 02:18.672
I didn't know you took Billy
and Nora to the park every day.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.842
- I do now.
- BOTH: [squealing]

02:21.942 --> 02:24.678
- *

02:24.778 --> 02:27.681
- WOMAN: * What you see
is not what you get *

02:27.781 --> 02:30.884
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:30.984 --> 02:34.222
* We fit right in,
bet you never guessed *

02:34.288 --> 02:37.358
* Living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:37.458 --> 02:40.928
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:41.028 --> 02:44.332
* Look closer, you might
see the crazy things we do *

02:44.432 --> 02:47.368
* This isn't make-believe,
it's our reality *

02:47.468 --> 02:50.404
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:50.504 --> 02:52.240
* And stay out of trouble

02:52.306 --> 02:56.244
* Living a double life

02:58.812 --> 03:00.581
- [zooming sounds]

03:00.681 --> 03:02.650
- [lasers blasting]

03:08.088 --> 03:10.157
- Laser tag rules!

03:13.461 --> 03:15.796
- No fair... you've
got burning-hot lasers

03:15.896 --> 03:19.066
and I have a frozen corn dog.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.769
- Life's not fair, turbo toes.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.104
- [lasers blasting]

03:26.274 --> 03:29.443
- MAX: Whoa!
- [thud]

03:29.543 --> 03:32.280
- Oh, watch the lasers, guys!

03:32.346 --> 03:34.815
- Life's not fair, turbo toes.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.818
Oh, wait... I'm turbo toes!

03:37.918 --> 03:40.288
- Gotta get this inside
before Dad sees it.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.125
- Where'd you get that safe?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.628
- Bought it off EvilBay,
belonged to Dark Mayhem,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.162
but no one can open it.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.299
- If nobody can open it,
then why'd you buy it?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.401
- 'Cause I know a kid
with laser eyes

03:53.501 --> 03:56.036
and another who can
hammer with super speed.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.306
- You know somebody
else with super speed?

03:58.339 --> 04:01.108
Oh, wait... me again.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.044
- Now let's go see what
evil treasures are inside

04:04.144 --> 04:06.614
that Dad doesn't
know he paid for.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.583
- Surprise corn dog attack!

04:09.683 --> 04:11.352
- [laser blasts]
- Ouch!

04:11.452 --> 04:15.523
- [clears throat] Have you
two been playing laser tag?

04:15.623 --> 04:18.759
- BOTH: Noooo...

04:18.859 --> 04:20.328
- Then why does the fence
have more holes

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
than my lucky underpants?

04:24.632 --> 04:26.800
- Uhh... it was Baby Lulu.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.737
- Hey, don't blame my doll!
- [laser blasts]

04:29.837 --> 04:31.539
- HANK: Nora!

04:31.639 --> 04:35.108
- Uhh... it was Baby Lulu.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.117
- In our defense,
we were only using

04:44.217 --> 04:45.786
the powers we were born with,

04:45.886 --> 04:49.723
so technically,
this is your fault.

04:49.823 --> 04:54.928
-I would never melt the face
off your mother's garden gnome.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.764
- Did that with one eye closed.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.566
- Ooh, nice, Nora!

04:58.666 --> 05:01.369
Bad Nora!

05:01.469 --> 05:04.204
- Yeah, thanks to you
two, your father and I

05:04.372 --> 05:07.575
have to drive all over town
replacing the stuff you ruined.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.743
- Why drive all over town

05:09.843 --> 05:12.680
when we can get
everything at CostClub?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.014
- CostClub, Hank?

05:14.114 --> 05:16.717
Every time you go there, you
buy something we don't need.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.388
- When have I ever bought
something we did not need?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.990
But Barb, it's a lawnmower

05:23.090 --> 05:26.159
and a barbecue.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.629
A mow-becue.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.964
We need this.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.400
- [sighs]

05:32.433 --> 05:35.869
How'd that work
out for you, Hank?

05:35.969 --> 05:39.840
- Kids, we're going
out for dinner!

05:39.940 --> 05:42.610
Hi, my lawn's on fire.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.012
- [spritzing water]

05:45.112 --> 05:46.814
- Well, you're the one
who wouldn't let me get

05:46.914 --> 05:49.149
the fire extinguisher-becue.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.921
- Fine, we'll go to CostClub.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.056
- All right!
- CostClub!

05:56.156 --> 05:57.858
- No, no, you two
aren't going anywhere.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.193
You're grounded because
of your little laser party.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.730
- What? No, no, no,
you can't ground them!

06:02.830 --> 06:05.699
I have to take them to
the park--my life depends on it.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.236
- That's what you said when
the Wi-Fi went out last week,

06:09.336 --> 06:13.441
and look... still breathing.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.543
- Sorry, Phoebe--Billy and Nora
are not allowed

06:15.643 --> 06:18.479
to leave this house.
- But we want to go to the park!

06:18.579 --> 06:20.614
- Park!

06:20.714 --> 06:22.215
- I thought you wanted
to go to CostClub.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.251
- CostClub!

06:24.351 --> 06:27.220
- No, you are not
going anywhere.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.491
- Great, now we're stuck here
cracking open Max's safe.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.026
- Safety books...

06:33.126 --> 06:35.796
is what we'll be cracking open,

06:35.896 --> 06:38.466
because that's what big
brother Max is all about.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.869
[laughs] Safety!

06:41.969 --> 06:44.371
- You know he's up
to something, right?

06:44.472 --> 06:47.475
- Doesn't matter--he can't
hurt us at CostClub.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.714
- Max, just let me take the kids
to the park for half an hour.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.050
- And go against Mother
and Father's wishes?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.887
Phoebe, that would be wrong.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.789
Come on, guys, let's
go do something wrong.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.791
- Wrong!

07:09.497 --> 07:11.064
- You're not getting
your way this time, Max.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.365
- MAX: Sorry, can't hear you.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.835
I'm too busy getting my way.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.575
- [loud chomp]
- Ow, you bit me!

07:21.675 --> 07:24.745
- Sorry, not sorry.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.080
- All right, since this
is a supervillain's safe,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.216
Nora, you're gonna use
your laser eyes

07:29.316 --> 07:32.385
to melt the titanium door.
- Whoa!

07:32.520 --> 07:33.787
- Yeah, whoa!

07:33.887 --> 07:36.156
And then Billy, you're gonna
use your super speed

07:36.256 --> 07:38.158
to pound it with these hammers.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.894
- Whoa!

07:40.994 --> 07:43.263
- Guess what, sis--
we're going to the park.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.032
Now we just need Billy.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.935
- Whoa!

07:48.035 --> 07:50.403
Brrrr...
- You're not Billy.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.806
- Yeah, well, you're not
Jennifer Lopez,

07:52.906 --> 07:55.375
so we both lose.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.277
Whoaaa!!

07:57.377 --> 07:59.179
[groans]

08:01.048 --> 08:03.684
- Whoa!

08:03.784 --> 08:06.253
What's going on?
- There's no time to explain.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.888
We're going to the park.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.758
Huh, guess there
was time to explain.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.396
- Well, guess I'll just sit here
and wait for Max to realize

08:16.564 --> 08:20.067
he was duped.
- MAX: Hey, I've been duped!

08:20.167 --> 08:22.670
- [laughs]

08:26.574 --> 08:28.075
- NORA: Monkey bars!
- Swirly slide!

08:28.175 --> 08:29.743
- Whoa, get back here, you two.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.913
A park is no place
to play around.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.849
Now keep your eyes
open for a hot guy.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.019
- There's one.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.056
- I meant "hot" as in cute,
not as in sweaty mess.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.828
- Hey, Phoebe!
- Hey, is that the hot guy

08:47.928 --> 08:51.231
you were talking about?
- Oh, Nora, have some candy.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.234
Hey, Dylan, so this
must be your brother.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.069
- Yeah, yeah, his name's Rusty,

08:56.169 --> 08:59.239
or as I like to call
him, Russ Man.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.743
No, I don't--I just
made that up--I'm sorry.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.913
- [laughs] Oh, I love babies.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.349
Who's the cutest wittle baby?

09:09.449 --> 09:12.519
- [crying]

09:12.620 --> 09:16.289
- Oops, I haven't taught
him how to act

09:16.389 --> 09:18.626
around pretty girls yet.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.994
- Oh, my gosh, you
just called me pretty!

09:21.094 --> 09:24.031
Oh, my gosh, I just
said that out loud!

09:24.131 --> 09:25.999
- Hey, can we go show
Rusty the balloons?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.635
- Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.102
- Well, actually, it'll give
us a chance to hang out.

09:29.202 --> 09:35.643
- Great idea, Billy--
[loud whisper] take your time!

09:35.709 --> 09:37.544
- Aww, look how cute they are

09:37.645 --> 09:39.512
with those matching strollers.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.815
Who knew we had
so much in common!

09:41.915 --> 09:44.652
This park, siblings...

09:44.752 --> 09:47.120
other things I haven't
thought of yet.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.256
- [laughs]

09:49.356 --> 09:51.191
I'm glad we're getting
to spend time together.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.493
- Me, too, this is so perfect.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.329
- MAX: Phoebe!
- Until he showed up.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.099
- [panting]

09:59.199 --> 10:00.801
Whew! Found you...

10:00.901 --> 10:03.904
Man, how many parks
are in this city?

10:07.007 --> 10:09.977
Right.
- Worst timing ever, Max.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.745
- Hey, you stole Billy and Nora
from me.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.146
- I needed them--
I had to make sure

10:13.246 --> 10:14.815
Dylan and I had
something in common,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.384
but now it turns out
Dylan likes me, too.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.019
What? I know, right?
Dylan's great!

10:19.119 --> 10:21.221
So you can have them back!

10:21.321 --> 10:23.724
- Hey, don't try to trick me
with your girl talk, all right?

10:23.824 --> 10:26.259
They're mine.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.929
- Hey, sorry about that, Dylan.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.131
My brother just came
to pick up my siblings.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.400
Gonna miss those
little bundles of love.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.068
- Oh, do you want
to go with them?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.170
- With who?

10:37.270 --> 10:39.439
- Billy, Nora, let's go.
- Not yet.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.776
Billy's using the balloons to
teach our babies their colors.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.779
- This one's blueberry,
that one's banana...

10:45.879 --> 10:48.148
- Fruits aren't colors!

10:48.248 --> 10:49.783
Let's go open my safe.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.251
- I'm not leaving.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.621
[in singsong voice]
And you can't catch me.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.991
- I don't need to catch you!

10:58.091 --> 11:02.095
I caught Baby Lulu.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.464
- It's really cool how your
family gets along so well.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.366
- Yeah, we're super-tight.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.835
- Pick up the pace, you whiners!

11:07.935 --> 11:09.837
- Give me back
my doll, you monster!

11:09.937 --> 11:14.307
- You're the worst
babysitter in the world!

11:14.407 --> 11:17.277
- So... remember when
you called me pretty?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.813
- [timer beeping]
- Oh.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.115
Time to feed my brother.
- Aww...

11:22.215 --> 11:24.417
[in baby voice] Is it
Rusty-wusty's feeding time?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.454
Who's a hungry wittle...

11:27.554 --> 11:30.357
doll?!

11:39.967 --> 11:41.835
- We were having so
much fun at the park,

11:41.935 --> 11:43.403
and you sucked it all away.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.006
- Yeah, you're
a fun sponge, Max.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.342
- Did you or did you
not agree to open my safe?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.812
- We didn't.
- Well, you're doing it anyway.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.547
And I don't want to hear another
peep out of either one of you.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.785
- [baby squalls]
- That was a peep--who peeped?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.820
- It was Nora's doll.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.388
- Baby Lulu doesn't cry.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.824
She's a lady--
she only wets herself.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.359
- [baby crying]

12:08.528 --> 12:12.565
- Cool! Baby Lulu came to life!

12:12.665 --> 12:15.402
- [baby crying]

12:17.137 --> 12:20.707
- Guys... this is a real baby!

12:20.808 --> 12:23.676
- It's Dylan's
baby brother Rusty.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.413
You took the wrong
stroller, fun sponge!

12:26.513 --> 12:29.416
- Turns out he's
a baby sponge, too.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.552
- [cell phone rings]
- It's Phoebe.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.687
- I wonder what she wants.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.727
- Hey, Phoebs...
what's the haps?

12:40.828 --> 12:44.097
- Oh, you know, just calling
to say hi, see how you're doing,

12:44.197 --> 12:46.366
[whispers loudly]
and you took a baby!

12:46.466 --> 12:48.068
- Hey, you took Billy
and Nora to the park

12:48.168 --> 12:50.203
when they were grounded--you're
in a lot of trouble, too.

12:50.303 --> 12:54.374
- Says the guy who took a baby!

12:54.474 --> 12:56.376
- All right, all right,
we'll take the baby back

12:56.476 --> 12:59.346
and switch them right
after we open the safe.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.381
- [whisper-screams] Baby!

13:01.481 --> 13:04.985
- Yeah, Phoebe, but what if
there's a baby in the safe?

13:05.085 --> 13:07.220
Huh? Huh?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.223
Okay, baby wins--
we're on our way.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.359
Okay, Rusty...

13:12.459 --> 13:14.561
- [laughs nervously]

13:14.661 --> 13:16.529
- All right, let's get
this baby out of here

13:16.629 --> 13:18.265
before Mom and Dad get home.
- [alarm sounds]

13:18.365 --> 13:20.733
- FEMALE VOICE: Alert, alert,
parents approaching.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.602
- Too late!
- Great, now we're gonna be

13:22.702 --> 13:25.572
double grounded... or arrested!

13:25.672 --> 13:27.007
- You guys stay here.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.876
I'll take him to the back.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.715
- BARBARA: Oh, perfect timing.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.785
I--whoa!

13:38.886 --> 13:40.988
- Coming through the back.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.890
- HANK: Who wants popcorn?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.392
- Not before dinner.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.261
- We're surrounded--
what do we do?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.763
- Relax, I have a plan.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.303
- That was your plan?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.271
- I didn't say
it was a good one.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.940
- Let's just go turn
ourselves in

14:00.040 --> 14:02.976
and take our chances
with the cops.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.112
- Thanks for all
your help, kids.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.314
Your father went
overboard at CostClub.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.449
Again!

14:09.549 --> 14:10.918
- What?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.921
I only got the bare essentials.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.789
- [truck reverse beeping]

14:16.924 --> 14:18.758
- Leave the crate of owls there,

14:18.926 --> 14:20.427
but make sure you put
the mayonnaise barrels

14:20.527 --> 14:22.829
in the shade.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.098
- [baby crying]

14:25.198 --> 14:26.699
- Is that a baby crying?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.435
- No, that's, uh, me.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.772
I'm just so mmm-emotional
with puberty and all.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.943
- Ohh, honey, Max,
it's okay to cry.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.946
Let it out.
- [farting sound]

14:39.012 --> 14:42.349
- Okay, that's not
quite what I meant.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.118
- Sorry... my body's
just so confused.

14:47.154 --> 14:50.557
- [baby crying]

14:54.427 --> 14:56.729
- Okay, that definitely
sounds like a baby.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.332
- Now you're calling me a baby?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.806
- Aww... poor kid
needs a tissue.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.010
Well, I hope we bought enough.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.218
- [sighs] There you go, Rusty.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.720
Mmm, that's some good bottle.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.589
[speaking quietly]
Where are you, Max.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.191
- Oh, the bottle's still full?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.458
Here, let me try.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.360
- Oh, look--a guy in camouflage!

15:27.460 --> 15:35.102
- What--that's weird.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.638
- I don't see him.
- 'Cause he's in camouflage.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.675
Uh, look who's
done with his bottle.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.511
- Wow, he drank that fast.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.014
Okay, I'm probably
gonna have to burp him.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.781
- No, no, I'll do it...

15:48.881 --> 15:51.684
right after we play
Kick the Stroller.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.488
Now you go kick it back.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.524
Hurry--you're losing!

15:57.624 --> 16:01.161
- [mouthing words]

16:01.261 --> 16:05.665
- [baby crying]

16:05.765 --> 16:08.535
- Can't sneak him out
until he stops crying.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.671
Why won't he stop crying?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.273
- Bring him here, Max.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.842
I got this.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.144
Boo!

16:17.244 --> 16:19.346
- [baby cries more loudly]

16:19.446 --> 16:21.814
- That's probably
why I don't have kids.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.350
- [baby crying]

16:23.450 --> 16:26.419
- What's that smell--
is that poop?

16:26.519 --> 16:30.057
- I believe the scientific
term is "doo-doo."

16:30.090 --> 16:33.093
- Nora, give me
one of my T-shirts.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.929
- Uck!

16:37.064 --> 16:38.598
- [groaning]

16:38.698 --> 16:40.767
Oh, dirty diaper, dirty diaper!

16:40.867 --> 16:45.272
- [water sprinkling]
- Baby pee, baby pee!

16:45.372 --> 16:48.441
- All I wanted to do was
open up Dark Mayhem's safe

16:48.541 --> 16:50.077
full of evil treasures.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.979
- You opened up something evil.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.283
- MAX: That should do it.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.318
Nora...
- On it!

16:58.418 --> 17:00.587
- [laser blasts]

17:00.687 --> 17:02.722
- All right, you guys stay
down here and watch Rusty.

17:02.822 --> 17:03.990
I'm gonna go get
rid of Mom and Dad.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.192
- Are you kidding?

17:05.292 --> 17:08.195
Who knows what's gonna
come out of that kid next?

17:08.295 --> 17:11.264
- What? Come on, look at him.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.900
He's a happy baby.
Yeah, Rusty?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.569
Isn't that right, Rusty?
Yeah... yes, it is.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.338
Yes, you are... yes, you are.

17:18.438 --> 17:22.008
- [water splashes]

17:22.109 --> 17:25.412
- Eww! He puked!

17:25.512 --> 17:28.715
- I believe the scientific
term for that is "baby barf."

17:28.815 --> 17:32.319
- Yeah, I know
what it is, Billy.

17:32.419 --> 17:37.690
- [laughing wildly]

17:37.790 --> 17:39.926
Oh, that's the stuff.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.165
- Hank, you bought
too much stuff.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.799
It's not all gonna fit.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.768
- That's because
you're packing it all wrong.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.937
Egg rolls go on the bottom.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.005
Were you raised in a barn?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.407
- You know that I was.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.377
Why do you keep bringing it up?

17:57.477 --> 18:00.513
- Sorry... here, just
let me do it, all right?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.215
- Now watch--you're stacking
these wrong.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.251
Okay, here we go--
get these down,

18:04.351 --> 18:06.153
and you need to create
a foundation.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.155
There you go, a foundation.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.523
Next, [indistinct]--
get that in there.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.626
Get all the air out.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.962
Finally, here this...
- No.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.165
- Yes, watch--watch!

18:18.265 --> 18:20.867
Gotta believe--gotta want it!

18:20.967 --> 18:22.602
All right.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.309
There... it all fits.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.884
- Hmm... that never
happened in the barn.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.788
- Max!

18:41.888 --> 18:44.391
- Uh, yeah, what's up?

18:44.491 --> 18:47.527
- We're heading back to CostClub
to return a few things.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.862
- [clears throat]
- A lot of things.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.732
Mistakes were made in bulk.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.368
- Keep watching Billy and
Nora--they're still grounded.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.537
- Yep, you got it.
- Here, take these pretzels

18:57.637 --> 19:00.740
down to the kids.
- [grunts]

19:02.642 --> 19:04.611
- Okay, so Kick the Stroller
was kind of fun,

19:04.711 --> 19:07.614
but I'm sick of Run, Baby, Run,

19:07.714 --> 19:10.483
and I have to put
Rusty down for his nap.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.220
- Um, why don't you two
take a nap together?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.523
Nothing bonds a family
like unconscious time.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.126
- I would like my brother now.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.761
- Wait, uh...

19:21.861 --> 19:23.996
let me sing him a lullaby.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.566
* Lullaby and good-night
- Phoebe.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.102
- * Don't talk,
Rusty's sleeping *

19:30.237 --> 19:32.038
- Phoebe!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.411
- Okay, I have a confession.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.649
It's actually kind of funny--
you are gonna laugh!

19:42.749 --> 19:44.384
- Okay.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.253
- See, I just wanted to show you

19:46.353 --> 19:48.154
that we had stuff in common,

19:48.255 --> 19:50.089
but it got a little
out of control, and--

19:50.257 --> 19:52.759
here's the funny part.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.095
I kinda...

19:56.263 --> 19:58.531
cheated at Kick the Stroller.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.500
Yeah, technically
I double-kicked,

20:00.600 --> 20:03.102
which is a huge no-no
in stroller kicking.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.371
[fake laughing]

20:04.471 --> 20:06.606
You're not laughing.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.341
- Give me my brother back!

20:12.745 --> 20:14.547
Get them off me!

20:14.647 --> 20:17.650
- Uh, don't struggle, Dylan--it
only makes the balloons angrier!

20:17.750 --> 20:19.286
- Get them off--get them off!

20:19.386 --> 20:21.388
[screams]

20:21.488 --> 20:23.523
- Touchdown!

20:23.623 --> 20:25.792
- Give me that!

20:25.892 --> 20:29.061
- Bye, Rusty--it's been smelly.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.638
- [baby coos]

20:40.540 --> 20:42.642
- What was that?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.844
- Balloon attack.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.880
No one ever thinks
it can happen to them.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.550
So anyway, here's Rusty.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.885
- Thanks.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.221
Well, I should probably
get him home.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.057
He's had a long day.

20:58.157 --> 21:02.094
- So, uh, should we do
this again tomorrow?

21:02.194 --> 21:04.230
- Tomorrow's bad for me.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.533
Um, I have soccer practice,

21:06.633 --> 21:10.036
and you have... serious issues.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.106
- Oh, yeah, well,
your brother has been gone

21:14.206 --> 21:15.475
for the past three hours,

21:15.575 --> 21:18.110
and I've been holding a doll.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.480
- Oh, no, he's coming back--run!

21:24.851 --> 21:27.019
- Come on, Max--how much longer?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.788
- Yeah, we're hungry!

21:28.888 --> 21:30.990
- I told you, you each
get 40 pounds of pretzels

21:31.090 --> 21:34.461
when you crack the safe.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.366
- Out of the way,
out of the way!

21:39.466 --> 21:42.635
Finally, Dark Mayhem's
evil treasures are mine!

21:42.735 --> 21:44.537
Will it be a Doomsday device?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.439
Plans to take over the world?

21:46.539 --> 21:49.175
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be dark.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.846
[screams]

21:59.919 --> 22:02.922
[in squeaky voice]
Oh, yeah, that's dark.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.291
Really dark.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.160
- BOTH: [laughing]

22:08.260 --> 22:09.529
- [laughing]

22:11.764 --> 22:16.469
- *
