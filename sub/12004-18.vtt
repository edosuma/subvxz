<i>Previously on "Switched at birth..."</i>

00:04.683 --> 00:07.208
- That's great!
- Are you Ms. Munoz?

00:07.209 --> 00:08.958
I had a baby here 16 years ago.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.671
I remember putting her in her crib,

00:10.672 --> 00:12.369
and I thought it was the right one.

00:12.370 --> 00:13.903
If it was me, I'm sorry.

00:15.897 --> 00:17.134
Hello.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.840
It's really nice to meet you.

00:18.841 --> 00:19.906
I went out on a limb to put you on

00:19.907 --> 00:21.830
this team and I'm starting
to regret that decision.

00:21.831 --> 00:23.232
You put me on the team because I'm deaf

00:23.233 --> 00:25.149
and the school gets disability funding.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.384
Okay, so what did you
really think of Bay's work?

00:27.385 --> 00:29.606
I'm looking for artists that
have something unique to say.

00:29.607 --> 00:30.762
That painting of yours

00:30.763 --> 00:32.593
would go great in a show
I'm putting together.

00:32.594 --> 00:33.904
I think it would really fit in well.

00:33.905 --> 00:35.486
I heard we're going up against each other.

00:35.487 --> 00:37.219
Tell him you don't want
to go out for guard.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.888
I'm not doing that.

00:38.889 --> 00:42.417
Wow. I guess you're not
the friend that I thought you were.

"Put the towel"

01:11.390 --> 01:12.828
"on the table."

01:17.416 --> 01:19.785
Put. Put.

01:26.438 --> 01:28.458
"Please, may I have some pie?"

01:30.539 --> 01:32.911
- "Please may I"...
- Hey.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.476
Olivia let me in.

01:42.011 --> 01:43.087
I'm sorry.

01:43.488 --> 01:45.800
Hey, you sounded really good.

01:46.388 --> 01:48.974
Just keep going. Can I help?

01:52.359 --> 01:53.730
Well, I mean...

01:54.249 --> 01:56.964
You spoke to me before, so I thought...

02:01.339 --> 02:02.405
Right.

02:02.879 --> 02:05.846
I was the same way about ice skating...

02:05.847 --> 02:07.916
You know, private about practicing.

02:10.806 --> 02:12.393
Yeah. No, I know.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.197
Ow! That's loud.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.309
Sorry.

02:19.199 --> 02:21.174
Ugh. Not you again.

02:25.969 --> 02:28.601
How is it going? Bothering you?

02:30.696 --> 02:32.005
It gets easier.

02:32.513 --> 02:35.673
You didn't do speech therapy, did you?

02:35.674 --> 02:38.527
No no no, but I did have
to learn how to sign

02:38.528 --> 02:39.981
and that was hard enough.

02:40.574 --> 02:44.406
You know, it's just really
important that you stay relaxed.

02:49.974 --> 02:51.088
This'll help.

02:56.153 --> 02:57.750
One shot of that...

02:57.751 --> 02:59.946
you're in the zone.
I mean, you can't learn

02:59.947 --> 03:01.679
if you're too tense, right?

03:06.058 --> 03:07.142
Cheers.

03:08.632 --> 03:10.556
Uh, what is she gonna give you

03:10.557 --> 03:12.817
for your S.A.T.s?

03:13.052 --> 03:14.119
Heroin?

03:26.404 --> 03:28.336
- Simone!
- Come on, Sinclair, make that pass!

03:28.337 --> 03:30.918
- Simone, I'm open!
- Watch your point guard, Sinclair.

03:31.141 --> 03:32.660
Vasquez is open.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.604
What are you thinking?

03:38.642 --> 03:41.114
I can't do my job as point guard
if you don't give me the ball.

03:41.115 --> 03:43.021
You weren't open.
Meghan was all over you.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.817
She was like 10 feet away.

03:44.818 --> 03:46.272
- She's really fast.
- We don't have all day.

03:46.273 --> 03:49.201
Look, can't we work together on the court?

03:49.202 --> 03:51.205
We're both still on the same team, right?

03:51.450 --> 03:53.351
Absolutely. No worries.

03:53.352 --> 03:54.559
Come on, girls.

04:09.052 --> 04:12.022
You have amazing powers of concentration.

04:12.492 --> 04:14.540
How long have you been standing there?

04:15.074 --> 04:17.209
Hour, hour and a half.

04:17.845 --> 04:20.777
I just... I just know that a minute tilt

04:20.778 --> 04:23.296
one way or the other is gonna
make all the difference

04:23.297 --> 04:26.276
between people loving them or hating them.

04:26.277 --> 04:30.462
I've heard the people of Kansas City
are very tilt conscious.

04:31.654 --> 04:34.861
Your work is extraordinary.

04:35.645 --> 04:39.625
It's just I haven't done
anything new in 13 years.

04:39.897 --> 04:42.162
I mean, I've sketched but...

04:44.440 --> 04:46.103
I probably shouldn't have told you that.

04:46.104 --> 04:49.254
- Oh hey, no judgment.
- Yeah.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.424
That's how you get everybody to tell you
their secrets, isn't it?

04:52.886 --> 04:55.924
I took a kind of career aptitude test
in high school.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.118
It's supposed to tell you
what professions you're best suited for.

04:58.119 --> 05:01.198
- Let me guess... psychiatrist.
- Clergyman.

05:01.199 --> 05:03.079
Oh my.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.849
Are your daughters gonna
come to the opening?

05:04.850 --> 05:07.454
Oh, that still sounds so strange...

05:07.624 --> 05:08.816
"Daughters."

05:09.343 --> 05:11.404
Um, Daphne is coming,

05:11.405 --> 05:14.584
but I haven't asked Bay yet.
That's a little trickier.

05:14.585 --> 05:19.253
Mmm. Well, I'm glad I get to meet Daphne
and I hope Bay comes.

05:19.254 --> 05:21.145
There's some stuff here I think
she'll really respond to.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.342
Mmm.

05:23.437 --> 05:25.180
You know, I do think

05:25.181 --> 05:27.796
that would actually look better...

05:32.743 --> 05:35.222
- with a little tilt.
- Mmm.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.850
But that's impossible.

05:38.057 --> 05:40.296
The hospital can't fire you.

05:40.672 --> 05:43.308
There are whistle-blower
laws to protect you.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.339
And they know that,
which is why they're saying

05:45.340 --> 05:47.731
it's because I was late twice last month.

05:47.732 --> 05:50.045
They're calling it "Erratic work habits."

05:50.046 --> 05:52.766
- That is ridiculous.
- That's what's happening.

05:53.272 --> 05:56.178
Well, maybe you can get another job.

05:56.219 --> 05:58.248
There's always a demand for nurses, right?

05:58.249 --> 06:00.316
I've submitted 25 applications

06:00.317 --> 06:02.307
to other healthcare facilities.

06:02.475 --> 06:04.533
Most of them won't even
give me an interview.

06:05.319 --> 06:08.926
An H.R. person finally told me...
off the record, of course...

06:09.167 --> 06:11.045
word is out that I'm a troublemaker.

06:11.046 --> 06:12.579
You're not a troublemaker.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.476
You're just holding

06:13.477 --> 06:16.543
the hospital accountable for
overworking their staff.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.342
That's not how they see it.

06:18.393 --> 06:19.679
I have an interview this afternoon

06:19.680 --> 06:21.351
for an ultrasound tech position.

06:21.352 --> 06:23.318
- But you're a nurse.
- I need a job.

06:25.681 --> 06:26.491
And I just wanted to tell you

06:26.492 --> 06:27.722
personally that if I don't get this,

06:27.723 --> 06:29.552
I'm gonna back out of the lawsuit.

06:30.852 --> 06:32.908
Our case will fall apart without you.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.213
Maybe you'll... just give me

06:34.214 --> 06:35.643
a chance to talk to our lawyer before...

06:35.644 --> 06:38.532
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kennish,
but I have to take care of my family.

06:38.589 --> 06:41.685
Maybe if I back out, somebody
will be willing to give me a job.

06:46.817 --> 06:49.161
What up, female athlete of the month?

06:49.408 --> 06:51.114
- What?
- You didn't see the bulletin board

06:51.115 --> 06:54.628
- outside the locker rooms?
- No, I was kinda distracted.

06:54.629 --> 06:57.718
- Thinking about me, huh?
- Actually, no.

06:58.198 --> 06:59.613
And I am not offended by that,

06:59.614 --> 07:02.220
because I too was named
athlete of the month...

07:02.229 --> 07:03.960
male, of course. Lacrosse.

07:03.961 --> 07:06.182
So what does that mean,
athlete of the month?

07:06.183 --> 07:08.008
Do we get a certificate or something?

07:08.009 --> 07:10.716
A certificate is only
the beginning, my friend.

07:10.717 --> 07:12.944
We also get a delicious steak dinner...

07:13.534 --> 07:15.487
I'll eat yours, you can have my sides...

07:15.488 --> 07:17.342
some Kansas City royals tickets

07:17.343 --> 07:20.815
and enough free XS Rush to fill a hot tub.

07:21.123 --> 07:22.415
Excess what?

07:22.416 --> 07:25.002
No, X.S. Rush... the sport drink.

07:25.003 --> 07:26.711
They're like a big corporate sponsor.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.222
All we have to do
in exchange for our swag is

07:28.223 --> 07:30.895
take one of their guys on
a little tour of the school.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.402
Great.

07:32.611 --> 07:33.256
You're probably gonna need

07:33.257 --> 07:35.705
to muster a little more
enthusiasm for the tour.

07:36.119 --> 07:38.744
Simone is making my life miserable.

07:38.745 --> 07:39.883
I'm pretty sure being named

07:39.884 --> 07:41.592
athlete of the month isn't
gonna help with that.

07:41.593 --> 07:43.124
Whatever. It's Simone.

07:43.125 --> 07:46.079
All I want to do is be a part
of a good basketball team.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.747
I just want it to be fun.

07:47.748 --> 07:50.928
Then you should focus on Wilke and swag

07:50.929 --> 07:53.941
and possibly reconsider
that XS Rush hot tub idea.

07:57.591 --> 08:00.127
Please may I have some pie?

08:00.182 --> 08:02.781
Please may I have some pie?

08:02.782 --> 08:05.901
- Please...
- Bay, what are you doing?

08:06.306 --> 08:07.769
You're gonna damage your hearing.

08:07.770 --> 08:10.332
I just had them on for like a minute.

08:13.054 --> 08:16.408
I was trying to see what
it feels like to talk

08:16.409 --> 08:18.559
without being able to hear yourself.

08:20.511 --> 08:23.089
- And?
- It's weird.

08:23.090 --> 08:25.062
It's like your voice
isn't part of your body.

08:25.736 --> 08:28.288
Yeah, I used to put
my head under the water

08:28.289 --> 08:31.397
in the bathtub to see what
it was like for Daphne.

08:32.087 --> 08:33.187
Yeah.

08:38.265 --> 08:39.379
So...

08:40.827 --> 08:42.621
how's the art show coming along?

08:42.621 --> 08:43.634
Fine.

08:46.367 --> 08:49.639
You know, I've been
thinking a lot about it

08:49.640 --> 08:51.187
and I want you to understand...

08:51.188 --> 08:52.701
Seriously, it's fine.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.115
Would you be interested in coming?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.980
"New voices from the prairie." Huh.

09:02.981 --> 09:05.203
Wow. Patrick's idea?

09:05.204 --> 09:07.407
I know you're not a big
fan of his right now...

09:07.408 --> 09:09.324
You don't have to defend him. I get it.

09:09.325 --> 09:11.502
It's the real world.
Some people are chosen,

09:11.503 --> 09:16.430
- some are not.
- And those chosen few are constantly changing.

09:16.837 --> 09:19.291
So much of this is luck and timing.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.207
And one of the ways to

09:21.208 --> 09:23.527
improve your luck is to
put yourself out there,

09:23.528 --> 09:25.846
get to know the people doing the choosing.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.386
And by "You," you mean me.

09:28.387 --> 09:31.447
Yes, I think this would
be a great opportunity

09:31.448 --> 09:34.969
for you to get an inside look
into the Kansas City art scene.

09:35.127 --> 09:36.949
I'm not inviting a lot of people,

09:37.758 --> 09:41.161
and it would mean a lot
to me if you were there.

09:44.662 --> 09:45.883
Well, then I'll be there.

09:47.192 --> 09:48.196
Great.

09:49.233 --> 09:50.227
Okay.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.826
Master T, strutting it!

11:39.827 --> 11:41.672
Hey, what's up, man? You wanna jam?

11:41.673 --> 11:43.941
I'm just dropping some stuff off
to Daphne. How about tomorrow?

11:43.942 --> 11:46.978
- Sure.
- Oh! And awesome news...

11:46.979 --> 11:49.603
I got athlete of the month...
hence the swag...

11:49.604 --> 11:51.404
which means my dad's super-psyched,

11:51.405 --> 11:54.441
which means Guitar Face can
practice in my basement again.

11:54.442 --> 11:57.810
- G.F. back in action! ♪ whassup!
- Oh yeah.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.749
Hey, I heard about you and Simone.

12:02.170 --> 12:05.013
Yeah, we... we've been hanging out.

12:05.014 --> 12:06.782
Yeah, well, let me know
if you need any pointers.

12:06.783 --> 12:09.436
She can be pretty demanding,
if you know what I mean.

12:09.557 --> 12:11.916
- I'm doing all right, but thanks.
- All right.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.213
Oh, and I guess she's kinda being hard

12:14.214 --> 12:15.703
on Daphne on the team.

12:15.704 --> 12:18.324
So if it comes up,
maybe ask her to back off.

12:18.874 --> 12:21.557
Dude, are you really trying to
be a referee in a girl fight?

12:21.558 --> 12:23.464
Can I get you a training
bra while you're at it?

12:27.213 --> 12:31.278
Hello. Hey, yeah.

12:34.982 --> 12:36.310
Yeah, I can stop.

12:37.334 --> 12:38.644
Regular or diet?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.534
Yes yes, I am writing it down.

12:44.105 --> 12:47.087
Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now. 10:15?

12:47.559 --> 12:48.931
Okay, cool. Thanks.

12:51.695 --> 12:53.927
- You didn't really write that down.
- Shut up.

12:56.185 --> 12:57.459
Brizia texted me this morning

12:57.460 --> 12:59.830
and it doesn't sound like
her interview went very well.

12:59.831 --> 13:02.102
Maybe it's a scam and
she's looking for a handout.

13:02.103 --> 13:04.063
No, it isn't and she is not.

13:04.064 --> 13:06.574
- Did she ask you for money?
- No.

13:07.227 --> 13:11.010
But she sounds really desperate.
We have to do something.

13:11.011 --> 13:14.411
Honey, we can't pay her anything
and the guest house is occupied.

13:14.817 --> 13:17.230
John's right about the money, Kathryn.

13:17.231 --> 13:20.034
It's not illegal,
but if the hospital found out,

13:20.035 --> 13:22.054
they could try to convince the jury

13:22.055 --> 13:23.223
that she's only testifying

13:23.224 --> 13:25.302
on our behalf because we're paying her.

13:25.303 --> 13:28.214
But that's not true. She was gonna
testify before they fired her.

13:28.215 --> 13:29.772
It would destroy Brizia's

13:29.773 --> 13:32.871
credibility and ours.
It's too big of a risk.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.501
Well, how are they gonna find out?

13:35.502 --> 13:38.090
- Kathryn!
- It's a legitimate question.

13:38.091 --> 13:40.295
Bank accounts are easily traceable.

13:40.296 --> 13:43.552
A big withdrawal or a series of
small ones could raise eyebrows.

13:43.553 --> 13:45.490
For the duration of this case,
you have to assume

13:45.491 --> 13:48.632
that everything about you
is being scrutinized.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.312
They just gave us these?

13:54.023 --> 13:56.496
- They do that every month?
- Yup.

13:56.497 --> 13:59.077
Authentic Dwayne Bowe.
I'm giving mine to my dad...

13:59.078 --> 14:00.829
keep that goodwill coming.

14:00.830 --> 14:04.350
I've looked at these online.
They sell for like $200 each.

14:04.351 --> 14:06.282
Yeah, and they frown on
us trying to resell them.

14:06.283 --> 14:07.875
Been there, punished for that.

14:08.058 --> 14:11.805
We should probably go over our
talking points for the tour.

14:11.806 --> 14:14.274
Oh, I hate talking in groups.

14:14.632 --> 14:16.981
Sometimes I miss it when
someone asks a question

14:16.982 --> 14:19.952
or I get distracted when
they're talking to someone else.

14:20.261 --> 14:22.261
It's a small group and
I'll be your wingman.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.112
Stop worrying. Just think "Peppy."
They love peppy.

14:25.113 --> 14:27.390
And we're just supposed to
be thanking them, right?

14:27.391 --> 14:29.975
And encouraging them to
continue contributing.

14:29.976 --> 14:30.776
We're still a few hundred

14:30.777 --> 14:32.737
thousand short for the new aquatic center.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.621
- The what?
- Aquatic center.

14:36.765 --> 14:37.991
Aquatic center?

14:38.633 --> 14:41.290
This is a high school, not the olympics.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.621
I think you should do this bit

14:42.622 --> 14:44.834
about how our basketball
scores have improved

14:44.835 --> 14:46.894
since we got that new
sprung floor in the gym.

14:46.989 --> 14:49.153
And I will talk about the scoreboard.

15:53.739 --> 15:56.327
Regina really wants me to go

15:57.100 --> 16:00.299
and I wanna support her,

16:00.809 --> 16:02.658
but I guess I feel...

16:03.401 --> 16:04.584
jealous.

16:05.679 --> 16:08.893
I don't know. It would
just be so much easier

16:09.570 --> 16:12.025
if you would go with me.

16:27.085 --> 16:28.670
This is amazing!

16:32.203 --> 16:36.572
Yeah, but you miniaturized...
you made it smaller.

16:36.978 --> 16:39.847
And you made it sticky.

16:40.679 --> 16:41.915
This is awesome.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.575
What about school?

16:54.627 --> 16:59.084
Haven't you missed a lot of school

16:59.085 --> 17:01.511
since you moved here with your dad?

17:10.210 --> 17:11.271
What?

17:19.811 --> 17:21.008
I don't know.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.679
Maybe because that's how you graduate

17:24.680 --> 17:27.238
so you can go to college

17:27.467 --> 17:30.845
and you can work somewhere
other than a minimart

17:30.846 --> 17:34.653
while you wait for
your photography career to take off.

17:44.884 --> 17:46.672
No, it's just...

17:47.233 --> 17:48.354
I'm surprised.

17:53.556 --> 17:57.204
Me and Melody... that's a laugh.

18:11.202 --> 18:13.993
Hey, mom. Oh, do you need some help?

18:13.994 --> 18:17.287
Uh, no, this is the last box.

18:17.321 --> 18:20.601
I'm doing my part by dropping
all this poisonous stuff off

18:20.602 --> 18:22.210
at the hazardous waste dump.

18:22.211 --> 18:25.348
- Wanna come?
- Yeah, as much fun as that sounds...

18:25.349 --> 18:26.901
Yeah.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.823
What's up? What do you wanna talk about?

18:29.824 --> 18:31.664
Uh, I just...

18:32.219 --> 18:33.637
I had a question about Angelo.

18:33.638 --> 18:34.401
Oh, honey, I don't want

18:34.402 --> 18:36.331
to get back into all
that right now, please.

18:36.332 --> 18:39.167
Relax, mom. I'm not in attack mode, okay?

18:39.168 --> 18:40.087
I just... I'm wondering

18:40.088 --> 18:42.557
why you guys didn't
call immigration on him.

18:42.725 --> 18:44.837
I guess in the end we decided

18:44.838 --> 18:46.776
that what Angelo did or didn't do in Italy

18:46.777 --> 18:48.718
was really none of our business.

18:48.904 --> 18:52.065
And mostly we knew how hurt
you'd be if we turned him in.

18:53.051 --> 18:55.404
- Why?
- I'm just trying to figure out

18:55.405 --> 18:56.900
the DOs and DON'Ts of butting in.

18:56.901 --> 19:00.244
Well, I guess for me, it all depends on

19:00.245 --> 19:03.321
if someone's gonna get
hurt if I don't interfere.

19:04.462 --> 19:05.765
Okay, got it.

19:06.001 --> 19:09.346
Wait, are you thinking about
butting in on something?

19:09.388 --> 19:11.557
Me? Never. Although,
now that you mention it,

19:11.558 --> 19:13.415
if you really do wanna do your part,
you should probably leave

19:13.416 --> 19:15.656
the gas-guzzling S.U.V. at the dump too.

20:48.288 --> 20:51.519
I think Emmett might be in trouble.

20:53.626 --> 20:54.798
Can we talk?

21:02.149 --> 21:03.418
Okay.

21:04.658 --> 21:07.623
He doesn't seem to eat a lot of meals

21:07.624 --> 21:11.767
for one thing, and
he's missed a lot of school,

21:11.768 --> 21:13.387
which you know.

21:14.683 --> 21:16.063
And...

21:21.020 --> 21:24.765
he said that he wants to leave school.

21:26.322 --> 21:28.109
Well, not "Leave,"

21:28.936 --> 21:31.111
drop out. I don't know that sign.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.841
Leave forever.

21:44.751 --> 21:47.493
He said he doesn't need school

21:47.511 --> 21:50.432
to become a photographer, so...

21:57.844 --> 22:00.300
I know this is weird, but think how bad

22:00.301 --> 22:02.498
things would have to be
for me to come to you.

22:02.581 --> 22:03.961
Not that I-I-I... I wouldn't want to co...

22:08.394 --> 22:10.878
Emmett is gonna be so mad at me

22:17.037 --> 22:18.346
I...

22:19.622 --> 22:23.024
I just really care about him.

22:30.241 --> 22:32.793
I see the stars

22:33.387 --> 22:34.781
in the sky.

23:20.596 --> 23:23.430
I see the stars

23:23.750 --> 23:25.238
in the sky.

23:45.196 --> 23:46.470
Nuh-uh-uh-uh!

23:46.874 --> 23:49.297
I'm just trying to
celebrate your big moment.

23:49.298 --> 23:51.407
Yeah, celebrate me with sparkling water.

23:51.408 --> 23:53.538
And one for me with lime please.

23:58.038 --> 23:59.835
Regina, you look wonderful.

24:00.417 --> 24:01.426
The place looks great.

24:01.427 --> 24:03.074
The place cleans up all right.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.364
Your masks are already
getting some interest.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.866
Um, this is my friend Melody.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.481
And you remember Bay.

24:13.931 --> 24:15.264
Hey.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.657
Cool art.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.054
It's great to see you.

24:19.055 --> 24:20.557
Oh hey, be sure to check out

24:20.558 --> 24:22.318
those dresses over there.
I thought of you.

24:22.319 --> 24:25.532
This artist, she found a trunk
full of old clothes and letters

24:25.533 --> 24:27.956
and she attached
the letters to the dresses.

24:27.957 --> 24:29.270
Really beautiful.

24:30.306 --> 24:32.683
I drew on my mom's clothes once.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.402
She took my markers away.

24:36.874 --> 24:38.709
It sounds amazing. We'll check it out.

24:38.710 --> 24:41.827
- Where's Daphne.
- Daphne's got something at school,

24:41.828 --> 24:43.413
so she's gonna come by later in the week.

24:43.414 --> 24:45.832
Ah. Well, I'd better
get back into the fray.

24:45.833 --> 24:48.184
There's some collectors
I'd like for you to meet.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.315
I'm really glad you came.

24:50.707 --> 24:52.004
It's good to meet you.

24:55.525 --> 24:58.997
See? I told you you made an impression.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.303
Right, 'cause there's no way

25:00.304 --> 25:02.524
that he's just trying
to win points with you.

25:04.697 --> 25:07.610
Sorry. Inside voice.

25:08.058 --> 25:08.949
I'm gonna go hunt down

25:08.950 --> 25:11.494
the calamari.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.514
Wow. That's beautiful.

26:17.925 --> 26:19.367
It's really personal.

26:19.392 --> 26:22.155
She's that mom who found out
her daughter got switched at birth

26:22.156 --> 26:24.287
and and her life was like shattered.

26:24.859 --> 26:26.351
There's all this birth imagery,

26:26.352 --> 26:30.441
how bloodlines sort of
define who we are. I mean...

26:56.420 --> 26:58.669
He lines it up, he shoots

26:58.670 --> 26:59.979
and... boom... direct hit.

26:59.980 --> 27:03.667
The new XS Rush scoreboard
lights up like the 4th of July

27:03.668 --> 27:05.474
and the crowd goes wild.

27:06.056 --> 27:07.523
Thank you, Mr. Wilkerson.

27:07.524 --> 27:09.813
No, seriously, that scoreboard
is going to be amazing.

27:09.814 --> 27:11.884
Thank you so much for supporting Buckner.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.697
- Mm-hmm.
- It's support from companies like yours

27:14.698 --> 27:17.268
that keep Buckner at the
forefront of athletics.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.370
Not to mention awesome boosters.
Up high, Mr. J.

27:20.815 --> 27:22.639
See, we love that Buckner hall spirit.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.058
Wait till you see us at state this year.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.962
We're totally gonna dominate.

27:26.461 --> 27:27.763
Daphne's one of our proudest

27:27.764 --> 27:29.478
new additions to our girls basketball team.

27:29.479 --> 27:34.153
- Go Bulldogs!
- Terrific. Now is that... are you on scholarship?

27:34.154 --> 27:36.351
No, I do part-time here.

27:36.352 --> 27:39.451
I do all my academics at
Carlton school for the deaf.

27:39.452 --> 27:42.403
Actually, Carlton has
a basketball team as well.

27:43.290 --> 27:44.766
Can you help public schools?

27:44.767 --> 27:47.642
- 'Cause they could totally use your support.
- Yeah, uh...

27:47.643 --> 27:50.606
In fact, their basketball
team is about to be cut

27:50.607 --> 27:52.206
'cause they don't have enough money.

27:52.207 --> 27:54.284
Yeah, and that's why
you're playing for Buckner.

27:54.285 --> 27:55.698
Yeah yeah.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.661
Yeah, Buckner's great,

27:59.279 --> 28:01.700
but Carlton totally changed my life.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.239
You talk about teamwork, spirit?

28:04.240 --> 28:06.796
That place has it like nowhere else.

28:06.898 --> 28:08.569
They could really use your help.

28:10.506 --> 28:12.297
Hey, we only have one squash court,

28:12.298 --> 28:14.226
so don't tell us about hardship.

28:20.182 --> 28:22.282
Hey, come on. Let's go show you where

28:22.283 --> 28:24.156
the new athletic facility is gonna be.

28:24.157 --> 28:27.567
Or should we say XS Rush aquatic center?

28:51.285 --> 28:55.302
Uh, I mean, these are pretty cool.

28:55.397 --> 28:59.203
Other than that... good cheese.

29:10.143 --> 29:13.633
Kind of adult video shoot

29:13.634 --> 29:15.552
meets corporate fundraiser.

29:15.553 --> 29:16.796
Ah.

29:17.827 --> 29:21.652
- You're funny.
- Oh look, it's Emmett...

29:23.816 --> 29:25.902
and Cameron and Olivia.

29:37.310 --> 29:38.555
Hey.

29:38.918 --> 29:40.840
So that's it? You're just taking off?

29:41.608 --> 29:44.586
- The tour is over.
- Man, I don't get you.

29:44.604 --> 29:46.088
I mean, you seem like
you got it all together

29:46.089 --> 29:49.064
and then you go and
like self-destruct like that.

29:49.192 --> 29:50.978
I just said what was on my mind.

29:51.265 --> 29:52.657
So just because you're pissed at Simone,

29:52.658 --> 29:53.765
you torpedo the whole school?

29:53.766 --> 29:57.033
It's not because of Simone!
I couldn't care less about Simone!

29:57.556 --> 29:58.843
Then what?

30:00.874 --> 30:04.983
Wilke, you're really fun,
but you don't get it.

30:05.396 --> 30:07.494
You guys have so much.

30:07.924 --> 30:10.883
This wasn't really
the time to occupy Buckner.

30:12.117 --> 30:15.066
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize you'd be so mad.

30:15.067 --> 30:16.459
I'm not. It's just...

30:18.836 --> 30:21.093
Look, my dad is on
the board for this thing

30:21.094 --> 30:23.185
and I really needed it to go well.

30:24.368 --> 30:26.004
You should've told me.

30:26.186 --> 30:27.442
I kinda did.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.232
Maybe I'm not the only one
who doesn't know what's going on.

31:27.531 --> 31:28.377
What's happening?

31:32.574 --> 31:34.495
And the match hits dry grass.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.658
Diane and Dick Hara, huge collectors.
Let me introduce...

32:03.659 --> 32:05.288
- What is this?
- What's the matter?

32:05.289 --> 32:06.914
You used my personal
life without telling me?

32:06.915 --> 32:09.840
Turned it into some cheesy
headline to move your merchandise?

32:09.841 --> 32:12.509
- I wouldn't say cheesy.
- I am not a commodity.

32:12.510 --> 32:14.411
- My story is not a commodity.
- Hey!

32:14.412 --> 32:18.238
I am so sorry to interrupt,
but we've got a problem back there.

32:19.947 --> 32:21.372
- Who invited Cameron?
- Don't look at me.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.943
- Can I help?
- We got it.

32:37.127 --> 32:38.709
Oh, so happy
we're handling this delicately.

33:02.869 --> 33:04.963
What? Is that the sign for "Drop o..."

33:21.122 --> 33:24.023
What just happ... No wait. Emmett.

33:24.024 --> 33:25.251
Just don't.

33:43.361 --> 33:45.070
Sorry, I'm out of coffee. Can I?

33:45.071 --> 33:46.902
Uh, yeah, of course.

33:50.740 --> 33:52.747
Have you heard anything from Melody?

33:53.338 --> 33:55.059
Not since I dropped her off.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.292
I'm guessing Emmett spent
the night at his dad's.

33:58.293 --> 33:59.545
I'm guessing.

34:01.193 --> 34:02.970
- He's not answering.
- You did the right thing.

34:02.971 --> 34:04.446
He'll figure that out.

34:06.659 --> 34:08.774
I must have "Narc" written on my forehead.

34:10.033 --> 34:11.795
Melody told me you came to her.

34:12.074 --> 34:13.554
That took some courage.

34:13.891 --> 34:14.936
Yeah.

34:15.781 --> 34:18.277
She's actually pretty cool

34:18.916 --> 34:20.558
when she's not turning your art show

34:20.559 --> 34:23.172
into a telenovela for the hard-of-hearing.

34:24.178 --> 34:26.172
I'm so sorry about that.

34:27.889 --> 34:31.217
Let's just say it was
fine that it ended early.

34:31.217 --> 34:34.600
I would rather make art
than sell it, you know?

34:36.266 --> 34:38.773
That piece that wasn't for sale?

34:40.525 --> 34:41.688
Yeah?

34:43.029 --> 34:44.612
I really liked the wings.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.204
Did you make them out of leaves?

34:47.687 --> 34:51.190
- I did.
- They were Bay leaves.

34:53.527 --> 34:54.741
I know.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.549
I made that

34:59.470 --> 35:02.075
when I first found out
where you were and...

35:03.507 --> 35:04.841
what your name was.

35:06.128 --> 35:07.688
It was really beautiful.

35:08.837 --> 35:10.070
Thank you.

35:14.335 --> 35:16.515
Well, then take all
the baking soda away from him.

35:17.203 --> 35:19.397
I don't know. Hide it. I have to go, baby.

35:20.112 --> 35:21.208
Hi. There weren't any tables,

35:21.209 --> 35:22.009
but there's this other

35:22.010 --> 35:24.327
- place right down here.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

35:24.328 --> 35:26.820
- I had to leave the kids at home.
- Oh, you should've told me.

35:26.821 --> 35:29.776
No no, it's okay.
My oldest is 15. She can manage.

35:30.335 --> 35:31.493
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:31.494 --> 35:34.004
What is it? No, he can't go next door.

35:34.278 --> 35:36.490
Because I don't know what
those kids are up to.

35:37.158 --> 35:38.912
Keep him inside. Come...

35:38.913 --> 35:41.878
Because you're the oldest.
I will be home soon.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.106
I'm really sorry.

35:43.107 --> 35:45.216
Usually my mom helps out,
but she fell last week.

35:45.217 --> 35:46.443
- Oh no.
- No no, it's fine.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.550
I probably don't have time for coffee.

35:48.551 --> 35:50.324
Oh, well, I just wanted
to see how you're doing

35:50.325 --> 35:53.258
- and if you heard about that job.
- Not yet.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.395
Oh. Well, we spoke to our lawyer

35:56.396 --> 35:57.113
and he seems to think

35:57.114 --> 35:59.391
you might have a case for
wrongful termination.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.525
Okay. Is that why you wanted to meet me?

36:03.084 --> 36:06.775
Well, that and I wanted to give you this.

36:06.776 --> 36:10.585
It's just something to help you
out until things turn around.

36:11.291 --> 36:12.709
I can't take that.

36:12.879 --> 36:13.766
You've done so much to help

36:13.767 --> 36:15.496
our family and look
what it's done to yours.

36:15.497 --> 36:18.067
- No, I don't need it. Really.
- Would it help if I told you

36:18.068 --> 36:20.335
I sold something I didn't
need and if I bring it home

36:20.336 --> 36:23.153
my husband'll just use it
to put a TV in our bathroom?

36:23.643 --> 36:25.027
That's your argument?

36:26.412 --> 36:29.008
That hospital took so much from us.

36:29.569 --> 36:31.317
I don't want it to ruin your life.

36:34.584 --> 36:37.477
Please, from one mother to another.

36:40.155 --> 36:41.799
I will pay you back.

36:45.052 --> 36:48.216
Yes. Yeah, I'm coming home.
Yeah, right now.

36:53.794 --> 36:55.532
You had no right.

36:56.634 --> 36:58.568
I understand if you feel
like I took advantage.

36:58.569 --> 37:00.393
I don't feel like you took advantage.

37:00.394 --> 37:02.374
You took advantage. Let's start there.

37:02.375 --> 37:03.985
If I had any idea how upset you'd be,

37:03.986 --> 37:05.551
I'd have run the catalogue by you.

37:05.552 --> 37:07.557
How could you not think I would be upset?

37:07.558 --> 37:09.873
Would you want the most
personal thing about your life

37:09.874 --> 37:11.749
to be the only thing
people know about you?

37:11.750 --> 37:13.693
I didn't think it was a secret.
It was in the newspaper.

37:13.694 --> 37:17.200
Exactly, and I had no control
over what that reporter said.

37:17.201 --> 37:19.367
But I did not expect
you to pull this crap.

37:19.368 --> 37:21.144
I don't think of it as crap, actually.

37:21.145 --> 37:23.527
I mean god knows there's plenty
of hot air in selling art,

37:23.528 --> 37:26.074
but telling people stories...
that's what makes

37:26.075 --> 37:28.882
a bunch of paint and cardboard
into a living thing.

37:28.883 --> 37:30.540
That's where it gets its power.

37:32.568 --> 37:36.597
- What is this?
- I sold the red and the blue after you left.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.324
That's a lot of haircuts.

37:42.325 --> 37:44.112
I was hoping to use my commission

37:44.113 --> 37:46.520
to take you out to this new indian place.

37:48.492 --> 37:51.607
- What's your commission?
- 50%, standard for a gallery.

37:53.956 --> 37:55.210
First thing...

37:55.813 --> 37:58.405
we tell my story how I wanna tell it.

37:58.832 --> 38:02.401
- Okay.
- Second, I hate indian food.

38:03.359 --> 38:06.020
Well, what about barbeque?
We agreed on that, right?

38:06.533 --> 38:08.138
Are your arteries up for it?

38:08.315 --> 38:10.497
As long as we branch out after that.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.651
Do not get ahead of yourself.

38:29.281 --> 38:31.827
Hey, what's with the car?

38:31.828 --> 38:34.903
- Oh, did you get in an accident?
- Oh no, everything's fine.

38:34.925 --> 38:36.979
I bought it. Isn't it pretty?

38:37.644 --> 38:39.308
Yeah, it's pretty. What?

38:39.309 --> 38:41.624
It gets 43 miles to the gallon.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.719
- Our old car got 24.
- Yeah, baby, where is our old car?

38:44.720 --> 38:47.232
It's got this amazing entune system.

38:47.233 --> 38:49.684
You can listen to music on pandora.

38:49.795 --> 38:53.007
- You can buy tickets to the movie theaters.
- Kathryn?

38:53.008 --> 38:54.962
- Yeah, Kathryn, where is...
- And you like italian, right?

38:54.963 --> 38:57.556
- Yeah.
- Well, all you have to do is do this

38:57.557 --> 39:00.206
and it finds all
the local italian restaurants

39:00.207 --> 39:02.344
- and makes reservations.
- Kathryn.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.733
I traded in our S.U.V. and I bought this.

39:09.898 --> 39:12.149
You bought a new car
without talking to me?

39:12.373 --> 39:14.861
I sold our car, I bought this

39:14.894 --> 39:16.948
and gave the difference to Brizia in cash.

39:16.949 --> 39:18.729
It's not traceable, so

39:18.730 --> 39:21.859
we're helping her so
she can still help us.

39:25.204 --> 39:26.803
Honey, if you had seen her face...

39:26.804 --> 39:29.766
I don't think we should be
talking about this right now.

39:30.856 --> 39:33.261
- Okay.
- I mean seriously, Kathryn?

39:33.262 --> 39:36.028
Really? You're willing to put the trial,

39:36.029 --> 39:37.976
our family, on the line to help this woman

39:37.977 --> 39:39.409
who, by the way, might have

39:39.410 --> 39:41.249
been the woman who switched our daughters?

39:41.250 --> 39:43.189
She's a victim of the hospital too.

39:43.190 --> 39:45.382
- Come on.
- They overworked her

39:45.383 --> 39:48.077
and then they fired her
'cause she was gonna help us.

39:48.399 --> 39:51.342
I cannot believe you did
this without talking to me.

39:51.697 --> 39:53.408
'Cause I knew what you'd say.

39:54.689 --> 39:56.438
But it's the right thing to do.

39:56.439 --> 39:59.927
Really? Great. So I'm just
supposed to accept that?

39:59.928 --> 40:02.033
Well, it's done.

40:16.376 --> 40:19.409
Vasquez, I need a word.

40:21.925 --> 40:23.650
You wanna tell me what
happened this weekend?

40:24.493 --> 40:26.674
Were the talking points not clear enough?

40:29.228 --> 40:32.132
No, they... they were clear enough.

40:32.133 --> 40:33.979
When I put you up for something,

40:34.218 --> 40:35.690
I don't want boosters
calling and telling me that

40:35.691 --> 40:38.135
the kid I recommended is out
there promoting another school.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.953
I know. I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.859
Look, I understand
you're in a weird position,

40:45.751 --> 40:47.610
but this is your team.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.287
Act like it.

40:52.328 --> 40:54.642
Lacy is our best shooter.

40:54.643 --> 40:58.304
Okay, so why are
we passing the ball to Mia,

40:58.305 --> 41:01.191
who's no good. We both know this.
We have to be honest.

41:02.932 --> 41:04.450
One... one, two...?

41:06.268 --> 41:08.295
Lacy. Yes, Lacy. Right, that's...

41:08.916 --> 41:11.226
Oh, Heather! That's good.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.021
Hey, sweetie, what's up?

41:14.678 --> 41:17.481
Do you guys wanna see if
we can save this team?

41:21.363 --> 41:23.355
What? You're coming back?

41:24.621 --> 41:26.122
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

41:26.123 --> 41:27.751
Get over here. Mmm.

41:31.994 --> 41:33.095
Hey.

41:33.677 --> 41:36.069
Fancy finding you here.

41:36.663 --> 41:38.311
I mean actually in school.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.536
Come on, okay? I was worried about you.

41:50.978 --> 41:52.329
What was I supposed to do?

41:52.330 --> 41:54.905
Just watch you drop out of school?

41:56.350 --> 41:57.781
I tried.

41:58.302 --> 42:00.793
You said that I sounded like your mom.

42:02.703 --> 42:04.126
Come on. Okay, what...

42:04.517 --> 42:06.891
Do you think that I'm
trying to ruin your party?

42:06.892 --> 42:11.028
Why would I tell your mom, of all people,

42:11.029 --> 42:12.759
unless I thought that you were in trouble?

42:18.308 --> 42:19.908
You keep saying that you're happy,

42:19.909 --> 42:22.213
but to me you just look miserable.
