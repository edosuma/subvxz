Oh, hey Sandy, how's Tom?

00:59.693 --> 01:00.526
Hi Mary.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.227
Oh, he's great, thanks.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.196
Are you thinking of
a trip to Bali?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.631
Dreaming about it, maybe.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.800
Well, go in the Spring
before the high season starts.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.469
It's less crowded and
the weather is gorgeous.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.370
Wow.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.638
Have you been?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.940
No, but I have read that
book from cover to cover

01:14.975 --> 01:16.642
so it's almost like
I've been there.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.511
And while you're in
the area, you know...

01:19.547 --> 01:22.848
Australia is not that far away
and it's absolutely beautiful.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.183
Be a shame to miss it.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.484
You've been to Australia?

01:25.519 --> 01:26.685
No.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.554
Another great book.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.889
Ok, well, good to know.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.357
Let me know if
you need anything.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.393
Ok. Will do.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.793
Thanks.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.135
Hey.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.803
I just poured that for myself.

01:44.839 --> 01:45.982
Mary, don't you
remember anything

01:46.006 --> 01:48.307
mom and dad taught
us about sharing?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.042
Wait a second,

01:50.111 --> 01:51.588
weren't you supposed to have
study group today?

01:51.612 --> 01:52.945
I did.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.591
We quizzed each other while
we were shooting hoops.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.647
Hoops?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.149
Basketball.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.029
Tyler, I love that you're going
to business school, I do.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.686
But you need to take
it seriously.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.787
I know.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.122
I am.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.534
Ok, well dribbling hoops
doesn't sound like you're-

02:04.558 --> 02:05.724
Dribbling hoops?

02:05.793 --> 02:08.293
Wow, you really are a sports
nut, aren't you?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.473
Did you check the
year-end reports?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.729
I did.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.764
They are not bad.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.867
Not bad...

02:14.935 --> 02:16.913
Mary, the first thing they teach
us in business school

02:16.937 --> 02:18.871
is numbers in red
are not good.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.441
It's a slow time.
It'll pick up.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.609
Talk to mom and dad?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.110
No.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.190
And you're not going to, either,
because the store is ours,

02:27.214 --> 02:29.014
they're retired,
and this red stuff?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.549
It's our problem now.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.661
Well then we really need to
talk about updating the store.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.051
We have a website.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.186
We have a Facebook page.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.488
So we're competitive
with 10 years ago.

02:36.524 --> 02:40.359
Tyler, On the Same Page has
been here for almost 40 years

02:40.394 --> 02:43.228
because we're traditional.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.631
This is a place where people
can come in and pick up a book

02:45.666 --> 02:48.433
and have a conversation about
it with another human being.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.802
If there was another human
being here, that is.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.471
Look, this is a book store.

02:52.506 --> 02:57.476
It's not a web arcade digital
virtual cyber hacking zone.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.156
You have no idea what
you're saying, do you?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.879
No, I-I don't.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.816
The point is we haven't survived
for almost 40 years

03:04.852 --> 03:06.785
by trying to be something
that we're not.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.554
We've done it by being
who we are.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.455
Then why are you meeting
with Janet Dunleavy?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.891
Because we went
to college together.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.392
And she runs a big PR firm.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.893
Alright, fine.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.273
She offered to help out with
the 40th anniversary party.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.257
Wow. She must be a really
big deal if you're going

03:18.299 --> 03:19.331
all the way downtown.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.667
I mean, that is a big adventure
for you.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.637
Is this the part where you're
taking things more seriously?

03:25.673 --> 03:28.173
Oh man, he did it again.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.341
Who did what?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.342
Adam Clayborn.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.510
Who?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.945
The Denver Royals
hockey player.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.925
He got into it with a ref
last night and got booted

03:34.949 --> 03:36.348
from the game.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.094
Hockey. That's the one where
you throw the old pig skin

03:38.118 --> 03:40.485
down the field, yes?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.621
Sometimes I can't tell
if you're joking.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.634
I just don't care about some
guy in cleats getting kicked

03:44.658 --> 03:45.624
out of the game.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.937
Skates. Hockey is played
on skates.

03:46.961 --> 03:47.826
I know what hockey is.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.195
Do you?

03:50.231 --> 03:51.730
Go away.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.498
Hmm.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.545 --> 04:06.478
Uncle Adam!

04:07.314 --> 04:08.314
Woah.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.682
Good morning, Graham.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.018
Can we play monster?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.654
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.857
[growling]

04:18.892 --> 04:20.392
[screams]

04:20.461 --> 04:22.961
[giggling]

04:27.034 --> 04:29.167
Ok, little guy,
let's get you dressed

04:29.203 --> 04:31.003
so Uncle Adam can
get some sleep.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.437
No.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.872
You know we do have
a guest room.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.674
What can I say?
I like sofas.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.776
Sure you do.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.013
Come on.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.282
It's a little early for monster,
isn't it?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.594
It's never too early
for games that amuse

04:44.618 --> 04:45.884
four-year-olds.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.130
Or the grown-ups
who act like them.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.021
It is too early for
a lecture, though.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.133
Maybe you should have slept

04:50.157 --> 04:51.468
at your place instead of
on my couch

04:51.492 --> 04:53.558
Press was camped
out at my place downtown...

04:53.627 --> 04:54.627
I wasn't in the mood.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.727
Yeah, I know.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.995
Erica keeps calling
your phone

04:57.031 --> 04:58.441
and when you don't pick up
she calls mine.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.798
Over and over and over again.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.033
Did you tell her I was here?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.768
No, but I'm pretty sure
she knows.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.536
She's got powers
or something.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.982
Chuck, she's the president
of a hockey team.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.472
She's not a wizard.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.940
She's also really mad
at you.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.942
Erica is always mad at me.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.355
Yeah, 'cause you keep
causing trouble

05:12.379 --> 05:14.146
and costing us games.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.881
No, it's because we dated
years ago

05:15.949 --> 05:17.294
and she still hasn't
gotten over the fact

05:17.318 --> 05:19.384
that I broke up with her.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.720
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's
the losing the game part.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.991
Adam, you've been ejected
form three games this season.

05:26.026 --> 05:26.958
What happened to you?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.460
Woah.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.330
When we were on the team in
Texas we were the wild ones.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.876
Well, I got traded to Denver,
I met Sarah,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.499
got married and had a kid.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.134
I grew up.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.369
Maybe you should try it.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.837
What?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.306
And lose my child-like sense
of wonder?

05:41.342 --> 05:43.308
It's so quiet out here
in the suburbs.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.710
Why don't you move
back downtown?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.545
Because I am happy.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.548
Again, maybe you
should try it.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.027
Look, I'm the one who
had to convince Erica

05:51.051 --> 05:52.317
to bring you here

05:52.353 --> 05:54.286
because I promised her that
you have changed.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.488
This is why you got kicked
off the Texas team,

05:56.523 --> 05:58.156
Seattle and New Jersey-

05:58.192 --> 05:59.524
New Jersey was not my fault.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.870
The guy on the other
team started it.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.172
Well, according to you,
it's always the other guy.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.628
[phone ringing]

06:03.664 --> 06:04.841
If Erica cuts you
from the team-

06:04.865 --> 06:06.798
Erica's not gonna cut me.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.602
Ok, answer the phone then.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.204
I will.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.772
After I get some air.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.274
And a coffee.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.976
Right.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.171
Bookstore coffee.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.315
Can I help you, sir?

06:57.351 --> 06:58.550
Coffee, black.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.553
Oh, we don't have coffee.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.822
Oh, well that's mine.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.223
I'll take whatever you've got.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.992
Except none of that weird
flavoured stuff.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.560
If I wanted hazelnuts
in my coffee

07:08.629 --> 07:10.729
I'd go to wherever
hazelnuts are from.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.330
Oh, well now that
is interesting.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.843
You know, they originally
thought that they were

07:13.867 --> 07:16.935
from Damascus but now evidence
points to Scotland

07:16.970 --> 07:19.337
almost 9,000 years ago.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.872
Can I just get my coffee?

07:20.941 --> 07:24.342
Uh, we don't have coffee.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.877
Ok, I get it.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.323
I gotta buy a book first in
order to get a cup of coffee?

07:27.347 --> 07:30.182
No, you have to buy a book
because it's a bookstore.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.451
Look, fine.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.652
Here.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.719
Quilting.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.908
You got a problem with that?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.055
Nope.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.391
That'll be $19.95.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.635
Now can I get my coffee?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.971
We don't have coffee.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.872
This is a bookstore.

07:53.941 --> 07:54.984
All bookstores have coffee.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.085
No they don't.
This one doesn't.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.042
Then why did I just buy
that book?

07:57.110 --> 07:57.943
Because you need a hobby?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.044
I need a coffee.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.546
And we're right back
where we started.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.881
I want my money back.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.182
Sorry.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.652
You don't accept returns?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.654
People read books and then
they bring them back

08:09.690 --> 08:11.189
expecting a refund.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.024
But I just bought that
30 seconds ago.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.960
Store policy, no exceptions.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.161
[phone vibrating]

08:16.196 --> 08:18.029
Ok, I-just...

08:20.067 --> 08:21.299
Great.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.934
You know what?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.102
Never mind.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.304
I'll go find a real bookstore
somewhere.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.541
Sir?

08:30.444 --> 08:32.510
Aren't you forgetting something?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.355
Arrogant.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.858
Uptight.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.495
You know what?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.678
Ok, so I think we know
everyone here

09:06.713 --> 09:09.147
but for the record I'm Tyler,
this is my sister Mary,

09:09.182 --> 09:10.949
and we're here for book chat.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.952
Mary, what're we chatting
about today?

09:13.987 --> 09:16.288
The Great Gatsby by
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.189
One of my favourite books.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.625
You say that every week.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.993
How am I supposed to choose?

09:22.029 --> 09:24.162
There are too many good books.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.999
I mean, the whole world
is here.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.201
Well, why don't
we get started?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.781
Now, when I first read
The Great Gatsby

09:31.805 --> 09:33.705
I was struck by Fitzgerald's
colour imagery.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.708
He basically talks right
about how he looks,

09:36.777 --> 09:40.045
specifically colours that he
uses, I mean...

09:40.113 --> 09:42.614
we can just go right from there.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.828
I cannot thank you enough
for agreeing to help me out.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.018
Stop.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.364
You helped me through
my finals in college

10:21.388 --> 10:25.857
so I owe you a lot more
than some free PR advice.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.025
Paris.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.361
I've always wanted to go.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.608
You were always talking about
the places that you read about

10:31.632 --> 10:32.998
you were gonna go
and visit.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.165
Yeah.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.700
What've you knocked off
your list?

10:35.769 --> 10:37.102
Uh, well, you know, I uh...

10:37.137 --> 10:39.871
I did go a few places
after college

10:39.940 --> 10:41.973
but then I just got so busy
helping out my folks

10:42.009 --> 10:44.275
with the store and everything.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.112
And now you run it.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.046
Mmm.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.314
That's great.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.282
Well, it's not much, but...

10:51.318 --> 10:52.495
But that's why you came to me.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.452
So let's talk ideas.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.021
I had my staff do some research

10:56.056 --> 10:58.356
and where I would
love to start is getting

10:58.392 --> 11:02.027
On the Same Page more
integrated into the community.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.962
Uh, well, we've been
there almost 40 years

11:03.997 --> 11:05.697
so we're kind of a fixture.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.965
Sure.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.867
But these days it's a lot more
than longevity.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.602
You need to connect with people.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.270
How?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.916
Well, your neighbourhood has
a kid's hockey league,

11:13.940 --> 11:15.540
you could sponsor a team,

11:15.609 --> 11:17.487
or we could do more advertising
at nearby businesses.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.377
Oh, and the 40th anniversary,

11:19.446 --> 11:22.013
you need to do a big party
for that.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.882
Maybe a winter festival
kind of thing.

11:23.950 --> 11:28.019
Get the whole neighbourhood
to come out and celebrate.

11:28.055 --> 11:32.557
Um... all of these things
take money.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.025
You know the old saying,

11:34.061 --> 11:35.727
"you need to spend money
to make money".

11:35.796 --> 11:39.330
But you have to have the money
to spend the money to...

11:39.366 --> 11:41.266
I- what I'm trying to say is

11:41.301 --> 11:44.369
we would love to do things
like this but...

11:44.438 --> 11:45.937
Things are that tight, huh?

11:45.972 --> 11:47.539
It's a slow time
but it's gonna pick up.

11:47.607 --> 11:53.311
Mary, no one comes to see me
when things are going great.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.815
They come to see me
when things are... broken.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.284
I'm a fixer.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.219
I can fix this.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.554
How?

12:02.622 --> 12:03.788
Truth?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.323
I have no idea.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.892
But I am convinced that the
right idea will present itself

12:07.961 --> 12:13.398
and when it does
we're gonna be ready.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.301
Are you with me?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.703
I am.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.772
Great.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.044
Did you forget how to answer
your phone?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.178
Erica, I-

12:27.214 --> 12:28.713
Oh, no, no, no, Adam.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.849
This is the part where
I talk and you listen.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.451
That reminds me of
when we dated.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.320
Ten game suspension.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.488
Come on-

12:36.523 --> 12:37.689
This is the third time

12:37.724 --> 12:39.791
you've been kicked off
the ice this season.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.693
This last time cost us
the game.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.828
The ref completely missed
Jack being boarded.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.163
It's like he was blind.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.542
It's not your job to tell
the ref what he missed.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.501
It's your job to stay out of
trouble and win games.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.835
I'm sorry, ok?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.036
No, Adam.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.371
It's not ok.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.472
The owner of the team is-

12:54.508 --> 12:56.875
Your father.
Talk to him.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.543
I did talk to him.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.348
He's the one who talked me
out of cutting you.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.785
Are you sure there's not
some lingering, you know,

13:06.820 --> 13:10.955
animosity over me breaking up
with you?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.891
First of all, I broke up
with you.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.159
No, you didn't.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.660
And second of all,

13:15.695 --> 13:17.206
that was five years ago and
I promise you I am over it.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.696
Ok.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.465
Well, what would you have
to be over about

13:20.500 --> 13:22.634
if you broke up with me?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.435
Adam, I do not like being
this tense person,

13:24.471 --> 13:27.272
I really don't, but you just
bring it out in me.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.040
In fact, you know what?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.509
From this point forward
I'm gonna add one game

13:31.545 --> 13:33.711
to your suspension
for everything

13:33.780 --> 13:35.713
you say that makes me mad.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.182
I figure in about
ten minutes,

13:37.217 --> 13:38.828
well, you're gonna be out
for the rest of the season.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.451
Ok, ok.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.353
Just tell me what I have
to do to fix this.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.222
I'm glad you asked.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.459
Call our PR person.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.162
While you're suspended you
are going to work with her

13:51.198 --> 13:52.897
to repair your image.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.177
There's nothing wrong
with my image.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.266
Eleven games.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.701
For what?

13:56.770 --> 14:00.939
Adam, we strive to maintain
a positive image

14:00.974 --> 14:02.974
with the community and our fans.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.844
This is our image.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.946
This is yours.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.549
Ok.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.185
Ok. I'll call Janet Dunleavy
tomorrow.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.353
Today.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.055
And please just do whatever
she says.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.389
Don't argue with her,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.002
don't think you have
better ideas than her.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.492
Basically just don't be you.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.228
Got it.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.632
But just one more thing.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.634
I broke up with you.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.802
Twelve games.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.137
Totally worth it.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.759
So you guys are thinking
about going on a cruise

14:43.783 --> 14:45.116
this summer?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.351
Well...

14:46.386 --> 14:48.019
Well, your mother is thinking
about it.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.999
I'm thinking about whether
or not I want to think about it.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.223
Sweetheart, we
are retired now.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.959
This is exactly the kind of
adventure we should be having.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.394
Adventure?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.062
It's a Caribbean cruise.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.230
Oh, pfff.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.565
It's all-you-can-eat buffets,

15:00.634 --> 15:03.001
it's not wrestling crocodiles
in the Amazon.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.270
I just think that we should
take advantage of the fact

15:05.305 --> 15:08.806
that we do not have to worry
about the store anymore.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.209
Mary and Tyler have got it
all under control.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.977
Yeah, so how is the business?

15:13.013 --> 15:15.213
Paul.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.147
It's fine, dad.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.982
Don't worry.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.785
Tyler, how's school, honey?

15:20.820 --> 15:23.821
Well, I'm having
a little problem.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.889
Oh?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.357
What is it?

15:26.393 --> 15:29.961
There's this one class
and it's just not going well.

15:29.996 --> 15:33.865
It's like a-a balance sheet
that keeps coming up red.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.834
Oh, well what is it about this
class that's got you stumped?

15:36.870 --> 15:39.504
I've done all my readings
for it, obsessively,

15:39.539 --> 15:42.273
but um, I feel like
I'm falling behind.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.808
Can't keep up.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.610
Oh, well have you asked
for any help?

15:45.645 --> 15:46.544
Not really.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.046
That's not true.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.448
He-well, you've gone
to advisors,

15:50.483 --> 15:53.284
you just haven't figured out
exactly what to do yet.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.552
Hmm.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.055
Well, you gotta do what
you gotta do, kiddo.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.189
Mmmhmm.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.657
Your mother is right, Tyler.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.226
I mean, if you've got these
advisors giving you advice

16:02.295 --> 16:03.828
you should listen to it.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.631
Even if it means doing something
outside of your comfort zone.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.765
Hmm.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.134
Wait, like going on a cruise?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.170
[laughs]

16:12.205 --> 16:16.140
And that right there, kids, that
is why I married your mother.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.510
[laughing]

16:19.546 --> 16:20.945
<i>I'll take some wine, please.</i>

16:20.981 --> 16:22.647
Yeah, me too.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.812
I feel like I'm waiting
for the principal

16:42.836 --> 16:44.435
to put me in detention.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.770
It's not that bad.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.171
That's what I tried
to tell Erica.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.639
Oh, don't get me wrong,

16:48.675 --> 16:51.642
it's bad but we can repair this.

16:51.678 --> 16:56.681
We just need to find a way
to make people... like you.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.316
People like me.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.618
Oh, no.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.186
They don't.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.722
I had my team do a flash poll
last night after Erica called me

17:04.790 --> 17:09.060
and, well, the results...
they weren't good.

17:10.463 --> 17:14.365
Telemarketers have higher
likeability than you do.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.467
That's disturbing.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.203
But the good news is that
they want to like you.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.616
They love the idea of
a second chance

17:20.640 --> 17:22.807
and they are open
to giving you one.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.308
How?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.978
Well, one strategy I've used
in the past is sort of like

17:27.012 --> 17:28.378
a buddy system.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.326
We pair you with a respected
member of the community,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.383
someone who can balance
things out.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.886
According to this, mould has
a higher score than I do.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.554
Who would want to be
paired with me?

17:36.623 --> 17:38.189
You'd be surprised.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.891
We get you involved
in local activities,

17:39.959 --> 17:41.459
maybe do some
volunteer work,

17:41.494 --> 17:44.462
it's good PR for both you and
whoever we pair you up with.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.165
Did you have someone
in mind?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.633
Not yet, but...

17:48.668 --> 17:50.034
[phone rings]

17:50.103 --> 17:52.170
Sorry, hold on.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.273
Hi.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.341
Send her in.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.684
Mary.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.785
Hi.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.720
I'm so sorry to come by
unannounced,

18:09.789 --> 18:10.989
I just wanted to be very clear

18:11.024 --> 18:13.024
that I am so ready to do
whatever it takes

18:13.059 --> 18:14.358
to make this work.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.034
Excellent, because I know
just what to do.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.029
I'm going to pair you with
one of my other clients

18:18.064 --> 18:19.975
and you are both going to solve
each other's problems.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.965
That's wonderful.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.333
Who?

18:22.368 --> 18:26.304
Mary Campbell,
Adam Clayborn.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.639
You.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.141
You.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.309
Shall we get started?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.277
(Both): No.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.114
The hockey team will pay
for everything.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.616
This way we can put together
a big to-do

18:38.651 --> 18:40.618
for the 40th anniversary
of the store,

18:40.653 --> 18:43.488
and he can host it
or sign jerseys or something.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.157
We can sponsor a junior
hockey team, you can coach it.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.625
You and cute kids?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.371
This is the kind of immediate
boost of goodwill

18:49.395 --> 18:51.462
that you need in order
to get back on the team.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.030
Because when it works,

18:53.066 --> 18:55.466
when we take an uncouth
hockey player

18:55.502 --> 18:57.935
and turn him into a cultured
book lover

18:57.971 --> 18:59.504
who helps the community,

18:59.539 --> 19:01.639
you are going to get
the credit for that.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.474
You can be the hero
that rescues

19:03.510 --> 19:06.344
the beloved neighbourhood
institution.

19:06.379 --> 19:11.516
It's like you're Superman
and she's your Lois Lane.

19:11.551 --> 19:15.153
It's like you're Henry Higgins
to his Eliza Doolittle.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.456
It's a second chance you need
to reinvent the bookstore.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.826
Besides, if things are as bad
as you say they are,

19:21.861 --> 19:24.695
you need a fresh start.

19:24.731 --> 19:29.433
You need to do something big
to save the bookstore.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.203
You need a new beginning.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.606
This could be your last chance
to save your career

19:56.529 --> 19:57.706
[whispers] To improve
your image,

19:57.730 --> 19:59.041
just trust me this is going
to be fantastic.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.109
I'm already regretting this.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.032
This is going to be a disaster.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.433
Give it a chance.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.701
Good morning.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.036
Hi, Janet Dunleavy.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.671
Hi, I'm Mary's brother, Tyler.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.039
And you are Adam Clayborn.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.473
I'm a huge fan.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.142
I can see that.

20:11.177 --> 20:14.512
Wait, Mary, Tyler, there's
gotta be more to that story.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.758
That's our mother's
favourite show.

20:15.782 --> 20:16.881
It could be worse.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.194
You could be called
Joanie and Chachi.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.450
Why don't we get started?

20:19.485 --> 20:20.985
So, first up great news.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.387
I got a permit to do a winter
fest party out in front

20:23.456 --> 20:25.790
of the bookstore for
the 40th anniversary,

20:25.825 --> 20:29.026
which is our big chance to
reach a lot of people at once.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.194
It's in four weeks.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.462
Four weeks?

20:31.497 --> 20:32.942
Is that enough time to get
everything ready?

20:32.966 --> 20:34.232
Mmmhmm. That's why we're here.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
We can brainstorm ideas.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.036
We need a big one,
a showcase idea.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.638
Anybody?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.139
How about a food truck?

20:42.175 --> 20:43.341
Maybe one that serves coffee.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.542
How's the quilt coming?

20:44.611 --> 20:45.754
I'm just saying I've never seen
a bookstore

20:45.778 --> 20:46.978
that didn't have coffee.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.023
Visit a lot of them, do you?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.180
You don't know me.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.259
What was the last book
you read?

20:50.283 --> 20:51.515
Oh, and Sports Illustrated?

20:51.551 --> 20:54.952
Not a book.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.054
Ok, why don't we put
a pin in that?

20:57.123 --> 20:58.990
How about we talk about
the junior hockey team

20:59.025 --> 21:00.224
we're going to sponsor?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.804
We'll get a photographer
to come out and get Adam

21:01.828 --> 21:03.361
coaching the kids
and at the game.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.829
Oh, he-he's gonna
coach kids?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.030
Hey, I'm great with kids.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.365
Yes, 'cause you are one.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.510
You know, I'm here
to help you.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.812
You need me more
than I need you.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.701
What was that?

21:10.770 --> 21:11.836
I said you need-

21:11.871 --> 21:12.982
Oh, I couldn't hear you
over the racket

21:13.006 --> 21:14.272
all your customers are making.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.273
I think this is going great.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.175
Mmmhmm.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.343
You don't understand.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.112
She's impossible.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.848
Oh, I understand impossible,
Adam.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.982
You mean me?

21:25.018 --> 21:27.285
No. She's worse.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.464
She thinks she knows everything.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.687
She always has to be right.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.155
So you two have a lot
in common.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.124
Why are you here?

21:33.159 --> 21:35.159
Moral support.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.472
You two are enjoying this,
aren't you?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.496
Oh, yeah.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.629
Absolutely.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.798
Oh.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.670
This is a terrible idea.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.705
Mary, this is exactly the kind
of PR stunt

21:47.774 --> 21:49.140
the bookstore needs, ok?

21:49.175 --> 21:50.441
It's gonna be amazing.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.876
We can still back out.

21:51.944 --> 21:52.944
I'm putting up posters.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.011
You haven't finished yet.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.112
Not too late.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.014
Sorry, no backing out now.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.386
<i>I'll just put them back up.</i>

22:21.207 --> 22:22.640
Are we starting soon?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.342
Yes, we are.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.711
We are just waiting
for your coach.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.479
Adam Clayborn, right?

22:28.514 --> 22:29.613
Right.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.015
He's tough.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.117
It's cool how he argues
with the refs.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.519
No, it-it isn't.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.492
You're late.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.660
Sorry, I'm not used to-

22:42.695 --> 22:43.695
Responsibility?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.129
Mornings.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.665
Wow. It's really you.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.600
I'm Coach Adam.
What's your name?

22:49.635 --> 22:50.601
Noah.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.002
Nice to meet you, Noah.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.270
Would you mind telling Noah

22:53.306 --> 22:55.840
that getting into trouble
isn't cool?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.041
Absolutely not.

22:57.110 --> 22:57.675
Although-

22:57.710 --> 22:58.876
What're you doing?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.522
Well, I was just gonna say
that sometimes

23:00.546 --> 23:01.879
when a ref makes a really
bad call

23:01.948 --> 23:03.447
you can't just say nothing.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.693
For instance, this one time
in Albuquerque-

23:04.717 --> 23:05.883
No!

23:05.952 --> 23:07.196
You are not allowed to tell
a 12-year-old

23:07.220 --> 23:08.786
about that one time
in Albuquerque.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.154
You don't even know
what happened.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.123
If you were involved it could
not have been good.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.524
Now, listen.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.970
For some reason that is totally
beyond my comprehension,

23:14.994 --> 23:16.994
you are a role model
to these kids,

23:17.029 --> 23:18.629
so be a good one.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.064
Now repeat after me.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.267
Trouble, not cool.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.136
Trouble, not cool.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.971
That's right.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.306
So you can tell your friends
that and uh,

23:29.342 --> 23:30.352
we'll be over in a second.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.309
Ok?

23:32.345 --> 23:33.978
Ok.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.816
It's gonna be a disaster.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.352
Ok, no matter what we might
think of each other

23:41.387 --> 23:43.432
I think we can both agree that
the most important thing here

23:43.456 --> 23:45.790
is the team and making sure
they have a good time.

23:45.825 --> 23:51.362
So how about we call a truce
until after practice?

23:51.397 --> 23:52.997
Agreed.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.534
Ok.

23:58.938 --> 23:59.770
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

23:59.806 --> 24:01.338
<i>Let's get up.</i>

24:01.374 --> 24:03.174
<i>Alright.</i>

24:08.047 --> 24:10.314
I'm Adam Clayborn and
I'm gonna be your coach.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.783
And I am Mary Campbell.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.485
I am sponsoring the team.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.555
Well, actually,
On the Same Page is.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.290
Ok, who plays what position?

24:19.325 --> 24:21.405
Shouldn't you ask them to
introduce themselves first?

24:21.461 --> 24:22.793
That's what I was just doing.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.895
No, you asked them what
they do on the team.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.864
You didn't ask them anything
about themselves

24:26.899 --> 24:28.632
like what their names are
or their interests

24:28.668 --> 24:30.601
or what they wanna be
when they grow up

24:30.636 --> 24:31.669
or their favourite book.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.003
I like to start there.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.205
This is a hockey team.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.606
Yeah, so what're
you gonna do?

24:35.641 --> 24:37.453
Are you just gonna call them
by their playing places?

24:37.477 --> 24:38.542
[team laughs]

24:38.611 --> 24:39.710
Playing places.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.945
Yes.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.314
So this delightful young
human would be the-

24:43.349 --> 24:47.117
Please, I would love to hear you
list off the playing places

24:47.153 --> 24:50.120
of a hockey team.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.989
The goal... goalie!

24:52.024 --> 24:53.157
Goalie.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.392
Who's my goalie?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.696
Yes, you are.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.165
There you are, coming for it,
up top.

25:02.869 --> 25:03.869
Name another.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.102
I think I made my point.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.972
I think you made mine.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.441
Shall we?

25:10.476 --> 25:12.610
Ok kids, centre ice.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.873
I finished shutting
everything down.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.208
You up to anything tonight?

25:44.277 --> 25:45.654
You wanna come for dinner
with me and my friends?

25:45.678 --> 25:48.879
Uh, you know, I think I'm just
gonna stay in and read.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.147
What're you reading?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.682
Wuthering Heights.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.983
You've read it so many times.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.985
It just keeps getting better.

25:55.021 --> 25:58.155
Well, don't stay out
too late.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.968
Oh, and if you have
any questions about hockey

25:59.992 --> 26:02.359
you can just ask me.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.271
Bring it in, guys.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.106
Yes.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.511
Any questions?

26:20.546 --> 26:21.812
Noah.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.013
What happened
in Albuquerque?

26:23.049 --> 26:25.316
Oh-later.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.017
Uh, later, ok?

26:27.053 --> 26:28.497
Alright, we're gonna crush
it out there, right?

26:28.521 --> 26:29.553
Yeah!

26:29.622 --> 26:30.955
Respectfully, right?

26:30.990 --> 26:32.156
Yes.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.657
Because hockey has
a rich history.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.193
In fact, it dates back
to 1300 when a certain-

26:36.228 --> 26:37.628
You're kidding, right?

26:37.663 --> 26:38.896
I think that they could use

26:38.965 --> 26:40.698
a little bit of historical
context.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.800
I mean, just because Noah is
the centre forward

26:42.835 --> 26:44.535
and Jesse is right defense,

26:44.604 --> 26:46.415
they're both working to get
the puck into the crease,

26:46.439 --> 26:48.939
I don't think that they need
to be barbarians about it.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.708
Oh, someone read a book
about hockey.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.154
Don't know what makes
you think that.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.322
Because the other day
all you knew was goalie.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.612
Didn't wanna show off.

26:54.647 --> 26:55.946
Well, look, I think it's cute.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.359
Why don't you stick to
the books and let me deal

26:57.383 --> 26:58.527
with the important things.
You know, like winning.

26:58.551 --> 26:59.650
Winning isn't everything.

26:59.685 --> 27:00.818
Yes, it is.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.353
That's why it's a competitive
sport.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.932
If there wasn't a winner it
would just be people out there

27:03.956 --> 27:05.623
hitting a piece of rubber
with a stick.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.035
Did you know that the original
hockey pucks

27:07.059 --> 27:08.292
were made of wood?

27:08.327 --> 27:09.627
Stop it.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.228
Just...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.497
(All): On the Same Page!

27:20.940 --> 27:22.806
[whistle blows]

27:24.310 --> 27:25.609
Look at the front of the net!

27:25.645 --> 27:27.444
Good sportsmanship!

27:29.849 --> 27:31.015
Come on, guys, hurry back!

27:31.050 --> 27:32.616
Back check, hard!

27:33.219 --> 27:34.184
Stay on him.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.486
Play the man, not the puck.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.687
That doesn't make sense.

27:36.722 --> 27:37.866
It's a cardinal rule of defense.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.989
But we want the puck.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.391
Well, yes. We do.

27:42.728 --> 27:43.728
[whistle blows]

27:43.796 --> 27:45.029
Oh, come on!

27:45.064 --> 27:45.729
You can't give him
a penalty for that!

27:45.798 --> 27:46.864
What happened?

27:46.899 --> 27:48.143
We got a penalty.
It's totally bogus.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.433
Hey, ref!

27:49.468 --> 27:50.612
There's no way you call that!

27:50.636 --> 27:51.680
I don't think you should be
doing this.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.770
Let me handle this.

27:52.805 --> 27:53.604
It's my team. I'm going
to handle it.

27:53.639 --> 27:54.639
Handle what?

27:54.674 --> 27:55.472
You don't even know
what's going on.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.473
That's not the point.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.275
Hey, ref! Ref!
Let him play, ref.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.488
Where did you get
your whistle?

27:59.512 --> 28:00.711
A Cracker Jack box?

28:00.780 --> 28:01.478
You should not be talking
to him like that.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.813
He is wearing the shirt.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.284
Not exactly what I had
in mind.

28:16.429 --> 28:17.695
Look at this.

28:17.730 --> 28:18.929
I do look bonkers.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.297
What about me?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.376
I need good press,
not more bad.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
Guys, relax.

28:22.435 --> 28:23.934
We can fix this.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.547
I hope so, because my entire
life is in your hands right now.

28:25.571 --> 28:26.670
Mine, too.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.671
See? There.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.173
Now you have something
in common.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.043
Truce?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.112
For real this time?

28:36.682 --> 28:37.915
Truce.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.016
Wonderful.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.551
Things are looking up already.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.898
Now, we have three weeks until
the winter anniversary party

28:42.922 --> 28:44.621
and we still need that
showcase idea.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.924
How do I fit into this
anniversary party?

28:46.959 --> 28:49.460
Master of Ceremony, signing
autographs, kissing babies,

28:49.528 --> 28:51.261
whatever it takes.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.731
We're gonna do a trial run
at a book fair this weekend.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.899
Aren't book fairs expensive
to enter?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.267
Not this one.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.235
The school board is staging
it to promote reading.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.603
Oh.

28:59.672 --> 29:00.716
Besides, the hockey team will
cover any expenses.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.983
You've got a booth
right up front.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.041
Thank you. That's so nice.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.209
You're welcome.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.521
But since there's nothing
to host, per se,

29:06.545 --> 29:08.378
we need a good reason
for Adam to be there.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.613
Hmm.

29:09.682 --> 29:10.726
We could bring a bunch of books
about hockey.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.882
Great idea.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.751
Mary, do you know any good books
on hockey?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.052
Yeah, Mary.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.887
Do you?

29:18.524 --> 29:20.591
You and dad had the store
for almost 40 years

29:20.626 --> 29:23.927
without a problem and we've had
it less than a year and it's...

29:23.963 --> 29:25.195
it's got problems.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.630
Honey, you worry too much.

29:26.699 --> 29:28.232
I have to.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.579
I just don't know how to manage
the store and babysit this...

29:30.603 --> 29:32.436
Adam at the same time.

29:32.505 --> 29:33.737
Tyler said he's really nice.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.539
He's not.

29:35.574 --> 29:41.845
He is reckless, he is immature,
he's rude...

29:41.881 --> 29:44.081
why are you smiling like that?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.950
Oh, Shakespeare.

29:47.019 --> 29:50.354
Just a little quote about "the
lady doth protest too much".

29:50.389 --> 29:51.389
Oh, no.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.256
Oh, no?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.757
No.

29:53.793 --> 29:54.925
Mmmhmm.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.927
Not even a little bit.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.016
Excuse me.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.017
Hey.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.185
What is this?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.753
What is uh... it's a truck.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.121
I know what a truck is.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.623
Why is it in front of my store
with my sign on it?

30:26.692 --> 30:28.458
Oh. You must be Mary.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.071
Adam said you might be
a little high strung.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.728
What?!

30:31.764 --> 30:35.032
Listen, whatever this is
costing, I cannot afford it.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.700
Oh, Adam took care of it.

30:36.735 --> 30:37.901
Yeah.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.536
Are you opening soon?

30:39.572 --> 30:41.416
Because I got about three
people waiting to get a book

30:41.440 --> 30:43.874
and their free cup, so...

30:49.715 --> 30:52.115
Sorry for the delay.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.755
Thank you for helping me get
set up for the book fair.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.057
I'm suspended, remember?

31:00.092 --> 31:02.526
I didn't have anything
better to do tonight.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.528
Thank you also for
the coffee truck.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.131
That was very nice and we
actually sold a lot of books.

31:08.200 --> 31:08.832
Really?

31:08.868 --> 31:10.734
Yes. It was a good idea.

31:10.769 --> 31:12.369
Maybe a showcase idea.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.238
Don't push it.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.851
You know, if I don't get back
on the team

31:15.875 --> 31:17.674
I can always help you
run this place.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.610
[laughs]

31:19.678 --> 31:23.180
What are you going to do when
you're done with hockey?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.181
I don't know.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.116
I haven't thought about it.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.851
How can you not think
about the future?

31:27.887 --> 31:29.219
Not make a plan?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.755
Yeah, I'm more of a live in
the moment kinda guy.

31:31.790 --> 31:36.693
But without a plan
you're just wandering.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.040
Some of the world's greatest
discoveries were made by people

31:39.064 --> 31:40.764
who were just wandering.

31:40.799 --> 31:41.298
Really?

31:41.367 --> 31:42.199
Mmmhmm.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.735
Name one.

31:44.770 --> 31:45.936
The chocolate chip cookie.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.237
What?

31:47.273 --> 31:48.683
Some chef was trying to make
chocolate cookies

31:48.707 --> 31:50.051
and didn't have
the right ingredients

31:50.075 --> 31:51.419
so she put chocolate chunks
into the batter

31:51.443 --> 31:52.843
thinking it would mix in.

31:52.878 --> 31:55.045
It didn't, and that became
the chocolate chip cookie.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.580
That can't be true.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.081
It's true.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.751
Surely I would have heard
something about this.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.456
Ah.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.770
Ruth Wakefield in her kitchen,
1938...

32:19.838 --> 32:21.838
well I'll be darned.

32:21.874 --> 32:23.173
How did you know that?

32:23.208 --> 32:24.408
I read things.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.411
Other than Sports Illustrated.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.379
What's your favourite book?

32:29.415 --> 32:30.614
I don't know.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.749
What do you mean,
you don't know?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.251
Nobody's ever asked me that.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.398
I mean, surely there is some
book that made an impression

32:36.422 --> 32:40.357
on you at some point.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.858
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

32:41.894 --> 32:43.193
Really?

32:43.228 --> 32:44.561
I read it when I was a kid.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.896
Hadn't thought about it since.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.297
What did you like about it?

32:47.366 --> 32:49.700
Him and Huck Finn were
always out exploring

32:49.735 --> 32:52.402
and getting into trouble
and I always...

32:52.438 --> 32:55.005
I just liked the idea of it.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.540
It's a great book.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.542
It's... one of my favourites,
too.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.845
Although the Book Chat audience
says I have too many favourites.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.715
That doesn't surprise me.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.855
We're reading War of
the Worlds next.

33:11.890 --> 33:15.425
Oh, they turned that Tom
Cruise movie into a novel?

33:15.461 --> 33:18.061
I'm kidding.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.765
Anyway, here.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.500
In case you'd like to join us.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.380
You'd wanna hear what I have
to say about a book?

33:25.404 --> 33:28.405
I wanna hear what anyone has
to say about a book.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.240
I don't know if I'm gonna
have time.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.775
Right.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.088
I still have a couple chapters
of that quilting book to go

33:33.112 --> 33:34.778
and I have to see
how it ends.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.847
[laughs]

33:54.400 --> 33:55.599
Adam?

33:55.634 --> 33:56.867
Picture time.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.068
Uh, can it wait?

33:58.103 --> 33:59.614
I'm just talking to a couple
fans here.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.440
Adam, eyes on the prize.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.743
Sorry, ladies. Duty calls.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.782
Thank you. Thank you.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.483
Alright.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.818
What? They were fans.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.085
Please.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.320
Fans.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.554
They were groupies.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.123
Why, because
they were pretty?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.658
Pretty women can't
be hockey fans?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.138
I never said that, I just don't
think that you'd be paying

34:23.161 --> 34:24.806
so much attention to them
if they weren't pretty.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.295
That's not true.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.876
All people who love hockey
are seen equally in my books.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.802
Do you even believe the things
that come out of your mouth?

34:31.870 --> 34:33.603
[sighs]

34:36.641 --> 34:38.542
I'm sorry. I am.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.610
And I don't know what
it is about him

34:40.646 --> 34:44.947
but he is just so maddening and
he just pushes my buttons.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.315
It's not that bad.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.083
Oh, good.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.284
Oh, don't get me wrong.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.386
It's bad.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.786
May I see the article?

34:50.822 --> 34:52.155
I think it's best that
you don't.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.322
Just the headline?

34:53.391 --> 34:55.492
Something like "Mary and
Adam at it again".

34:55.561 --> 34:56.571
Well, you should talk to him.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.794
I have.

34:57.830 --> 34:58.662
And?

34:58.730 --> 34:59.496
And now I'm talking to you.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.497
Me?

35:00.566 --> 35:02.566
Yes, you.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.304
We are going to try this again
tomorrow at another event

35:07.372 --> 35:10.607
that I've set up, and I have
some ground rules

35:10.642 --> 35:11.708
for the both of you.

35:11.743 --> 35:12.909
But he's clearly-

35:12.945 --> 35:14.911
Both of you.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.223
Ok, so what are we here
to do?

35:26.258 --> 35:27.724
Donate books to the library.

35:27.759 --> 35:28.903
And what are we not here
to do?

35:28.927 --> 35:29.893
Argue.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.861
Or?

35:30.896 --> 35:31.995
Use our outside voices.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.497
Or?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.043
Do anything that might embarrass
us and, by extension, you.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.199
Very good.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.300
Are you guys ready?

35:37.336 --> 35:38.368
Mmmhmm.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.503
Here we go.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.471
Smiles.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.849
Car repair?

35:52.885 --> 35:54.651
What's wrong with car repair?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.520
Well... not exactly literature.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.754
You're such a snob.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.356
I'm not a snob.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.735
You think that just because
you read everything

36:00.759 --> 36:02.337
you're so much smarter and
better than everyone.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.572
You think that just 'cause I
read anything that I am a snob.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.829
This is your bias.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.041
Well, your bias is that
you think that people

36:07.065 --> 36:08.476
who play hockey are
out of control crazy.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.867
Nope, I don't think that
about everyone who plays hockey.

36:10.903 --> 36:13.236
You're the one who keeps
getting kicked out of games.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.186
Why do you get into so many
fights, anyway?

36:18.210 --> 36:21.211
I don't go out and randomly
start arguing with people.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.147
What, so "he started it"
is your defense?

36:24.183 --> 36:26.383
Kind of, yeah.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.418
The thing with the ref
at the last game?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.021
Someone on the other team
boarded a guy on my team.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.656
Boarded?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.891
Pushed him into a
wall excessively.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.560
The ref didn't see it.

36:36.595 --> 36:40.030
So I went to tell him and things
kinda escalated from there.

36:40.065 --> 36:43.733
So you were defending
your teammate.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.669
Yeah. You can do
what you want to me,

36:45.704 --> 36:47.804
I don't care. I can take it.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.184
But you don't mess
with my teammates

36:49.208 --> 36:51.374
or people I care about.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.477
That's rather nice.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.681
I have my moments.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.649
And you might be right.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.184
About what?

37:01.220 --> 37:07.657
I can be a bit defensive
around really smart people.

37:07.693 --> 37:08.892
I'm not that smart.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.094
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.365
Hi, Adam.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.700
Hi, Ms. Campbell.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.535
Noah, it's so nice
to see you here.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.803
Mom brings me every week.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.338
That's wonderful.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.817
By the way, she thinks
it's your guys' fault

37:22.841 --> 37:24.074
that we lost the tournament.

37:24.142 --> 37:27.477
Oh. She probably has a point.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.712
Just remember, Noah.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.147
Winning is not everything.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.749
Adam said winning's the best.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.218
Now, I don't know if I used
those exact words.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.519
You said only losers-

37:36.555 --> 37:38.989
Ok, Noah. So good to see you.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.491
Tell your mom I'll pay
for therapy.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.327
Kids love me.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.395
Mmm.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.063
And parents...

37:49.368 --> 37:51.635
You have got to make them
retract this.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.802
Why?

37:52.838 --> 37:55.505
Because we are not an item.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.040
It doesn't say that you are.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.886
It asks a question which allows
them to get away

37:58.910 --> 38:00.343
with just about anything.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.512
I do not want people thinking
this about us.

38:02.547 --> 38:03.880
About me.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.716
The important thing is that they
are thinking of you.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.151
She's right.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.564
I mean, look at all these
customers.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.798
We've had more people in
the store today than we've had

38:10.822 --> 38:13.023
in the past month combined.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.392
Yes, but most of them aren't
buying anything.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.994
They just wanna know
if I'm dating Adam.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.896
And, like, what's
his favourite colour?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.197
Which is green.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.833
Why do I know this?

38:23.869 --> 38:25.280
Mary, you just have to believe
in the plan.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.803
Plan.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.483
I'm looking for another good
thing to put the two of you in

38:28.507 --> 38:29.906
but in the meantime
we're working

38:29.975 --> 38:31.641
on the big anniversary party.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.288
That'll really be what turns
things around.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.244
Right.

38:34.313 --> 38:37.247
Ok. I have to go.
Call you later.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.216
Thanks, Janet.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.918
I'm very proud of you,
you know?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.053
Me?

38:43.088 --> 38:44.387
Why?

38:44.423 --> 38:45.722
You're trying new things.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.223
Opening up to new ideas.

38:47.259 --> 38:49.559
You're excited about the
possibility of what could-

38:49.594 --> 38:52.062
What do you want?

38:52.097 --> 38:54.230
I wanna record tonight's
Book Chat as a podcast.

38:54.266 --> 38:55.031
No.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.533
Mmm-mmm. No.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.713
You know I don't like talking
in front of a lot of people.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.203
It's not like you're gonna
see them.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.806
And besides, I'll edit out
the parts where you embarrass

39:02.841 --> 39:06.409
our family and bring about
the ruination of the store.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.548
[knocking]

39:13.318 --> 39:14.517
Hey.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.586
Got your message.
What's up?

39:16.655 --> 39:17.721
Have you heard from Adam?

39:17.756 --> 39:18.933
He was doing that library
thing today

39:18.957 --> 39:20.890
and I was expecting some
sort of disaster.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.959
No, it went fine, actually.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.528
In fact, did you see this?

39:27.265 --> 39:28.098
Oh.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.033
Yeah.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.000
Ok.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.235
I can live with that.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.837
Oh, that's good.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.538
It doesn't bother you?

39:35.574 --> 39:37.006
Why would it bother me?

39:37.042 --> 39:38.186
Well, because you and Adam were-

39:38.210 --> 39:39.210
I broke up with him.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.010
Ok.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.116
Bother me.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.084
That's ridiculous.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.423
Hi everyone, and welcome to
On the Same Page Book Chat.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.737
We're recording a podcast today
so if you wanna say something

39:55.761 --> 39:57.961
use a microphone, ok?

39:58.029 --> 39:59.262
Ok.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.797
Mary, over to you.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.399
Ok.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.439
Uh, what book are we doing
this week?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.107
Oh.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.444
War of the Worlds
by H. G. Wells.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.549
Sorry I'm late.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.252
Oh, thank you.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.789
Mary, you were saying.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.690
Yes.

40:27.726 --> 40:32.228
War-War of the Worlds
by H. G. Wells,

40:32.264 --> 40:34.697
often associated with
the 1938 radio drama

40:34.733 --> 40:36.766
of the same name by Orson Wells.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.168
Oh, and also-

40:38.203 --> 40:43.206
And-and say
your name.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.507
Adam Clayborn.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.210
Of the Denver Royals.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.447
And I was gonna mention
the Tom Cruise movie.

40:50.515 --> 40:51.614
I love that movie.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.249
Right?

40:53.285 --> 40:54.595
Adam, what did you think of
the book?

40:54.619 --> 40:56.786
I thought it was great.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.254
Good, good.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.867
But uh, what'd you think
about the themes?

40:59.891 --> 41:03.460
What was H. G. Wells
commenting on?

41:03.528 --> 41:06.629
Uh, alien invasions are bad?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.298
[laughter]

41:08.366 --> 41:10.366
Ok, that's a good point.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.435
But what about the issues
of colonialism?

41:12.504 --> 41:17.273
I mean, the British Empire was
making big moves at that time.

41:17.342 --> 41:19.242
Fine, but sometimes an alien
is just an alien.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.177
Sometimes an alien is
the king of England.

41:21.213 --> 41:22.679
Are you saying we
shouldn't comment

41:22.714 --> 41:24.280
on the deeper themes of novels?

41:24.349 --> 41:26.349
No, I'm not saying that,

41:26.384 --> 41:28.751
but you also don't wanna
over think things.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.788
This story is about two sides
in a battle for Earth.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.456
It's like an intergalactic
hockey game.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.426
But it's also about the battle
for survival of the human race.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.061
I mean, these aliens
are using heat rays

41:38.096 --> 41:39.429
to decimate entire towns.

41:39.464 --> 41:42.232
Now, I've read a lot of books
about hockey

41:42.267 --> 41:43.766
and frankly I don't see
an equivalent.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.735
You've never taken a puck
to the face.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.337
[crowd laughs]

41:47.372 --> 41:49.650
Fair enough, but I just think
we should dig a little deeper.

41:49.674 --> 41:52.342
It doesn't get deeper than
the basic urge to survive.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.878
Yes, so you're talking a basic
human reaction to stress.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.357
And you're talking about
fight or flight.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.947
Exactly.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.072
I still say you're missing
the point I was trying to make.

42:11.096 --> 42:12.228
Adam, let it go.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.630
Ok.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.409
But next week when we do
Dracula I am not backing down.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.066
That was you backing down?

42:17.102 --> 42:18.479
Compared to how most of my
disagreements with people end?

42:18.503 --> 42:19.602
Good boy.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.104
I thought it was great.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.071
Mary, that's the most I've
ever seen you talk in Book Chat.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.239
Well...

42:23.275 --> 42:25.275
You two are perfect together.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.581
Uh, Tyler, we're late
for dinner.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.182
Oh, um... I was gonna
ask you guys

42:33.218 --> 42:34.428
if you wanted to go
grab something.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.052
Oh, weekly dinner
at our parent's house.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.420
You're welcome to come.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.354
Oh, I don't know.

42:38.390 --> 42:39.689
Yeah.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.269
Really, it's just the four of
us, family thing-

42:41.293 --> 42:42.859
They'll love it.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.539
I mean, dad's a huge hockey fan
and mom always cooks too much.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.963
It's perfect. Come on.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.706
Seriously, these two were
fantasti

42:56.741 --> 42:58.875
gether.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.376
You guys are gonna love
the podcast.

43:00.412 --> 43:01.856
Well, I think it's great
you're trying new things

43:01.880 --> 43:03.046
in the store, honey.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.347
Don't you think so, Paul?

43:04.382 --> 43:05.715
I don't know.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.595
There's something to be said
for tried and true.

43:07.619 --> 43:10.353
Maybe there's room for both.

43:10.388 --> 43:14.357
You know, I was thinking maybe
we could add some sort of

43:14.392 --> 43:15.858
refreshment station.

43:15.894 --> 43:20.630
Somewhere where people
could get water or... coffee.

43:20.699 --> 43:22.398
That sounds wonderful.

43:22.434 --> 43:23.833
That sounds unbelievable.

43:23.868 --> 43:26.269
I am open to new ideas.

43:27.872 --> 43:30.173
[chuckles]

43:31.109 --> 43:32.109
I am!

43:32.177 --> 43:34.210
[laughing]

43:34.245 --> 43:35.778
Sure.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.116
You're pretty quiet, Adam.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.417
I'm just enjoying this.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.886
It's like watching
a really good play.

43:43.922 --> 43:45.199
So family dinners
weren't like this

43:45.223 --> 43:46.389
when you were growing up?

43:46.424 --> 43:47.557
No.

43:47.592 --> 43:48.769
No, I grew up in the foster
care system

43:48.793 --> 43:51.894
so I was always bouncing
from place to place.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.730
I didn't know that.

43:53.765 --> 43:55.198
It wasn't a big deal.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.244
There was this one family
that was really into hockey

43:57.268 --> 43:58.835
so, ultimately, it was
a good thing.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.169
That's wonderful.

44:00.205 --> 44:01.270
Wow.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.438
You should be really proud

44:02.507 --> 44:04.340
of all that you've accomplished,
Adam.

44:06.411 --> 44:08.611
You know what I'd be
really proud about?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.947
Is finishing more
of these potatoes.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.749
Go ahead.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.751
Thank you.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.731
So, how's things going
with the team?

44:28.767 --> 44:31.100
I'm still on the team so
I'm taking that as a victory.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.870
Right.

44:33.905 --> 44:36.939
How's working
with my sister?

44:37.008 --> 44:38.608
Great.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.843
It's just peachy.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.345
It's ok, Adam.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.225
I love her, but it can be
frustrating dealing with someone

44:44.249 --> 44:45.381
who can always
find a book

44:45.417 --> 44:47.283
to prove she's right
and you're wrong.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.352
Yes.

44:48.386 --> 44:49.519
What is up with the books?

44:49.554 --> 44:50.586
I don't know.

44:50.622 --> 44:51.788
You'll have to ask dad.

44:51.856 --> 44:52.933
There's a picture of her
in a crib

44:52.957 --> 44:55.291
holding a copy of Little Women.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.726
So she started early, huh?

44:56.761 --> 44:58.127
Yep.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.196
Smartest person I know.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.265
Except for when it comes
to relationships.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.233
Meaning...?

45:04.269 --> 45:07.670
None of them could hold up
to the heros in her books.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.506
You invited him home for dinner?

45:10.542 --> 45:12.909
Tyler invited him.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.211
But it ended up being
kind of ok.

45:15.246 --> 45:17.413
That is high praise coming
from you.

45:17.449 --> 45:18.681
You're starting to like him.

45:18.717 --> 45:20.216
I am not.

45:20.251 --> 45:23.352
Well, not in the way the local
paper is inferring, anyway.

45:23.388 --> 45:25.521
I didn't mean it that way.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.757
You are spending a lot of
time together.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.125
Making each other nuts.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.526
Some might call that passion.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.482
Some shouldn't call it that
'cause they're wrong.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.197
I think you guys are good
for each other.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.466
I'm not talking about just
from a PR perspective.

45:36.534 --> 45:41.437
Janet, this is all about
the bookstore for me, alright?

45:41.506 --> 45:42.939
Now, look.

45:43.007 --> 45:45.019
Sales are up but they're nowhere
near what they need to be.

45:45.043 --> 45:46.342
Patience.

45:46.377 --> 45:48.177
Trust in me,
trust in the process,

45:48.213 --> 45:51.114
everything will be fine.

45:51.182 --> 45:52.915
Alright.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.917
Ok?

46:09.734 --> 46:10.433
Nice job, Noah.

46:10.502 --> 46:12.034
Up high!

46:12.070 --> 46:14.148
Little more practice and you'll
be ready for the big leagues.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.339
I can't believe we get
to practice here today.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.385
I told my mom I wanted to be
a hockey player like you.

46:18.409 --> 46:19.709
Oh yeah?

46:19.744 --> 46:20.777
What'd she say?

46:20.845 --> 46:22.211
Nothing.

46:22.247 --> 46:25.348
She just closed her eyes
and put her hand on her face.

46:25.383 --> 46:26.582
Ok.

46:26.618 --> 46:29.352
What about your dad?

46:29.387 --> 46:32.455
He moved to California.

46:32.524 --> 46:35.358
Well, I think it's great that
you want to be a hockey player.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.037
But maybe you should tell
your mom you wanna be

46:37.061 --> 46:38.895
more like Wayne Gretzky.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.963
Who's Wayne Gretzky?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.600
Why does everyone keep
doing that?

46:46.738 --> 46:48.671
Who's Wayne Gretzky?

46:51.709 --> 46:52.842
Thanks for helping today.

46:52.877 --> 46:53.910
Of course.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.511
Except where was everyone?

46:55.547 --> 46:56.879
The photographers? Mary?

46:56.915 --> 46:58.014
This is off the books.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.448
It's a good group of kids.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.061
I like helping so I've been
doing some extra coaching

47:01.085 --> 47:02.451
here and there.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.853
That is very...

47:03.888 --> 47:05.021
Grown up of me?

47:05.056 --> 47:06.956
I have my moments.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.591
We need you back
on the team.

47:08.626 --> 47:11.027
I haven't been able to get it
together since you left.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.506
You've won three of the last
five games.

47:12.530 --> 47:13.963
We should have won all five.

47:14.032 --> 47:16.065
Got a big game on
the road tomorrow

47:16.100 --> 47:17.867
and I wish you were
gonna be there with us.

47:17.902 --> 47:20.903
I still have to do my penance.

47:20.939 --> 47:23.105
Things with Mary getting
any better?

47:23.174 --> 47:25.007
She's not so bad I guess.

47:25.043 --> 47:27.610
For you, that means
you like her.

47:27.679 --> 47:28.744
Does not.

47:28.780 --> 47:30.213
Hey.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.193
From what you've told me
she is exactly what you need.

47:32.217 --> 47:35.284
Somebody who stands up
to you.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.786
I don't think that's
what I need.

47:36.855 --> 47:38.921
But even if I did she's
made it pretty clear

47:38.957 --> 47:41.958
that she wants nothing
to do with me or my world.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.794
Well, have you shown
her your world?

48:03.915 --> 48:05.492
Sarah, thank you so much
for having us over

48:05.516 --> 48:06.616
to watch the game.

48:06.684 --> 48:08.918
Oh, hey. I love the company.

48:08.953 --> 48:11.254
I get so nervous watching these
guys play on the road.

48:11.289 --> 48:12.255
[groans]

48:12.290 --> 48:13.456
What happened?

48:13.524 --> 48:14.891
The other team just scored.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.566
What do we say when
the other team scores?

48:16.594 --> 48:17.727
Boo!

48:17.762 --> 48:20.296
Boo, that's right.

48:20.365 --> 48:21.764
They should make
the puck bigger

48:21.799 --> 48:23.532
so you can see it better on TV.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.234
That is a great idea.

48:25.270 --> 48:28.404
I'll take your suggestions
to the league.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.372
Ok, bud.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.273
Come on, bath time.

48:30.341 --> 48:31.274
No!

48:31.342 --> 48:32.575
Yeah.

48:32.610 --> 48:33.921
You can watch the rest of
the game later, ok?

48:33.945 --> 48:37.280
Otherwise the claw
will get you!

48:37.348 --> 48:39.282
[squeals]

48:39.350 --> 48:40.750
Come on.

48:40.785 --> 48:41.851
You guys need anything?

48:41.886 --> 48:42.785
No, we're good.

48:42.854 --> 48:43.886
I'm-I'm good.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.254
Are you good?

48:45.290 --> 48:46.122
Yep?

48:46.190 --> 48:47.223
I'm good.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.358
Ok, I'll be back in a bit.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.234
Thanks for coming today.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.269
I know hockey isn't
your cup of tea.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.873
Well, Sarah and Graham are
great and this hockey business

49:03.908 --> 49:05.174
is growing on me.

49:05.209 --> 49:09.278
Careful, soon you'll be
a fanatic like me.

49:09.347 --> 49:10.746
You really miss it,
don't you?

49:10.782 --> 49:12.848
Yeah, I really do.

49:12.884 --> 49:14.517
It's my whole life.

49:14.552 --> 49:16.185
Is that stupid?

49:16.220 --> 49:17.586
Well, if it's your whole life

49:17.622 --> 49:19.255
then getting kicked off
the team,

49:19.290 --> 49:22.091
probably not your
best move.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.759
Good point.

49:23.795 --> 49:25.606
I suppose I should learn
something from all this.

49:25.630 --> 49:26.729
Like what?

49:26.764 --> 49:29.265
Can I get back to you
on that?

49:31.536 --> 49:33.536
Well, what I've learned
is that I am not clear

49:33.571 --> 49:37.940
on all the rules of this game.

49:38.009 --> 49:41.577
Well, sometimes the best way
to learn is by doing.

49:53.391 --> 49:55.191
This is not what I had in mind.

49:55.226 --> 49:58.594
You were the one who said
you were open to new ideas.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.833
Ok...

50:19.517 --> 50:20.916
There you go.

50:24.589 --> 50:25.589
Thank you.

50:25.623 --> 50:27.089
Right.

50:27.125 --> 50:28.736
We'll have to work on your
stopping skills, but not bad.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.092
I just skated ten feet.

50:30.128 --> 50:33.029
I think it's a little bit early
for "not bad".

50:33.064 --> 50:35.398
What if I fall down a lot?

50:35.433 --> 50:37.544
You're wearing enough protective
gear to cushion a fall

50:37.568 --> 50:39.101
from space.

50:39.170 --> 50:41.315
Besides, it doesn't matter
how many times you fall down.

50:41.339 --> 50:43.417
It only matters how many
times you get back up again.

50:43.441 --> 50:45.408
Sounds like something
my dad would say.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.943
Yeah. Because he's awesome.

50:48.012 --> 50:50.079
Now, let's work on how
you're holding that stick.

50:50.114 --> 50:51.614
Yes.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.727
Let's put your right hand at
the top of the stick, like this.

50:53.751 --> 50:55.229
Yeah, bring the stick out
in front of you.

50:55.253 --> 50:57.420
Ok, there you go. Yeah.

50:57.455 --> 50:58.621
Now, left hand half way down.

50:58.689 --> 51:01.857
Perfect. Square yourself
up to this puck.

51:01.893 --> 51:03.626
So the puck should be
at nine o'clock.

51:03.694 --> 51:06.195
Bring yourself forward.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.863
Yeah, further.

51:07.899 --> 51:10.299
A little more.
Nice and square.

51:10.368 --> 51:11.700
Now, bring your stick back.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.202
Not too far.

51:13.237 --> 51:14.715
And when you bring it forward
make sure you make contact

51:14.739 --> 51:16.383
with the ice first
before you hit the puck.

51:16.407 --> 51:17.773
Before?

51:17.842 --> 51:20.009
Yeah. That way you're getting
full power of the shot.

51:20.044 --> 51:20.943
Try it.

51:21.012 --> 51:22.278
Ok.

51:22.346 --> 51:23.112
Before?

51:23.181 --> 51:24.580
Before.

51:34.892 --> 51:36.425
Ahhhhh!!!

51:36.461 --> 51:37.193
I hit it!

51:37.228 --> 51:38.861
I hit the puck!

51:38.896 --> 51:40.262
Woo!

51:40.298 --> 51:42.565
Nice job.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.900
Now you wanna hit it towards
the net, which is that way.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.236
Can't I just savour this
small victory first?

51:47.271 --> 51:49.905
Yes, you may.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.209
Woo!

51:53.244 --> 51:54.343
Woah.

51:54.378 --> 51:55.277
Are you alright?

51:55.346 --> 51:56.378
I'm fine.

52:09.794 --> 52:11.327
Alright.

52:14.332 --> 52:16.332
I have a fun idea
for the anniversary.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.734
What about doing a live version
of the podcast?

52:18.769 --> 52:20.469
Live?

52:20.505 --> 52:22.438
You mean in front of people?

52:22.473 --> 52:23.806
We do it in front of people now.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.274
Well, maybe ten at the most.

52:25.309 --> 52:27.121
There's gonna be way more
than that at the party.

52:27.145 --> 52:28.677
You are going to be fine.

52:28.746 --> 52:31.180
Oh, and I saw this and
I want you two to do it.

52:31.249 --> 52:32.181
Box race?

52:32.250 --> 52:33.782
Mmmhmm.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.629
I just don't see how decorating
a box and sliding down a hill

52:35.653 --> 52:36.986
is gonna help us.

52:37.021 --> 52:38.632
It'll show you're an active
member of the community.

52:38.656 --> 52:39.755
Sounds dangerous.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.123
Sounds like fun to me.

52:41.159 --> 52:43.492
Says the guy who runs around
in sharp metal shoes,

52:43.528 --> 52:44.793
slamming into people.

52:44.829 --> 52:45.661
Really?

52:45.696 --> 52:46.929
A lot.

52:46.964 --> 52:48.075
That's your view of hockey
even after hitting

52:48.099 --> 52:49.365
the ice with me last night?

52:49.433 --> 52:50.633
<i>What's this?</i>

52:50.668 --> 52:51.934
It's hardly the same thing.

52:51.969 --> 52:53.269
Oh, you were a natural.

52:53.304 --> 52:55.070
I'm sure there's some
hidden sledding talents

52:55.106 --> 52:56.906
in there, as well.

52:56.941 --> 52:59.108
They would be well hidden.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.242
<i>You're impossible.</i>

53:00.278 --> 53:02.011
<i>You're intractable.</i>

53:06.951 --> 53:09.518
It shouldn't be this difficult
to come up with a theme.

53:09.587 --> 53:10.664
Well, it has to be amazing.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.820
I wanna win this thing.

53:11.856 --> 53:13.056
You are obsessed with winning.

53:13.090 --> 53:14.423
Oh, please.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.992
You're the most competitive
person I've ever met.

53:17.028 --> 53:19.328
I am not competitive.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.930
At least not about winning.

53:20.965 --> 53:23.098
Anyway, I think I just like
to be-

53:23.134 --> 53:24.500
The smartest person
in the room?

53:24.569 --> 53:26.001
Are you calling me
a snob again?

53:26.070 --> 53:27.714
No, most of the time you
probably are the smartest person

53:27.738 --> 53:28.938
in the room.

53:28.973 --> 53:31.774
That's not being a snob,
that's just being right.

53:31.809 --> 53:34.109
Yes, well, sometimes being
right does come

53:34.145 --> 53:36.979
at the expense of being liked.

53:37.014 --> 53:39.448
Well, I'm very familiar
with not being liked.

53:39.483 --> 53:41.083
Oh, please.

53:41.118 --> 53:43.819
You have fans, friends,
relationships-

53:43.854 --> 53:45.321
Not ones that have lasted.

53:45.356 --> 53:46.855
Yes, but you don't
really strike me

53:46.924 --> 53:48.457
as the settling down type.

53:48.492 --> 53:50.304
I don't know, if the right
person were to come along.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.261
Ah, yes.

53:52.296 --> 53:54.296
The elusive right person.

53:54.332 --> 53:55.464
Hmm.

53:55.499 --> 53:59.802
You haven't found yours yet,
either, huh?

53:59.837 --> 54:02.438
Have you ever read a book
that was so good

54:02.473 --> 54:05.908
you just didn't ever
want it to end?

54:05.943 --> 54:08.344
I guess I've just never really
met a person

54:08.412 --> 54:11.180
who made me feel the same way.

54:11.249 --> 54:12.581
There's nothing wrong
with waiting

54:12.617 --> 54:13.894
for the right book
to come along.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.484
At least I don't think so.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.023
Yes, well, you get hit
in the head a lot,

54:21.092 --> 54:22.658
so can we trust your opinion?

54:22.693 --> 54:24.260
[laughs]

54:24.295 --> 54:25.761
So, Miss Competitive,

54:25.796 --> 54:29.598
what are we gonna do
to win this adventure?

54:29.634 --> 54:31.734
Adventure.

54:32.903 --> 54:34.336
Tom Sawyer.

54:34.405 --> 54:36.272
[together] A raft.

54:45.283 --> 54:50.085
These sleds are incredible.

54:50.121 --> 54:52.321
And yours is fantastic.

54:52.356 --> 54:54.523
Ta-dah.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.425
This hill looks pretty icy.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.771
Mary, are you sure
you're up for this?

54:57.795 --> 54:59.094
Not thinking about it.

54:59.130 --> 55:00.741
It's a cardboard box on
a snow-covered hill.

55:00.765 --> 55:03.198
Even if we fall off I'm sure
we'll survive it.

55:03.267 --> 55:04.600
And on that happy note,

55:04.635 --> 55:05.812
I'm off to see
your photographer.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.403
Ok.

55:10.975 --> 55:12.386
We don't have to do this
if you're scared.

55:12.410 --> 55:15.311
I'm not scared.

55:15.346 --> 55:16.945
I'm a little bit scared.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.080
Think about something else.

55:18.115 --> 55:19.982
Tell me what
your future holds.

55:20.017 --> 55:21.283
Great.

55:21.319 --> 55:23.319
I want the bookstore
to be a success,

55:23.354 --> 55:27.990
obviously, and... I wanna
travel, you know?

55:28.025 --> 55:32.161
I wanna go to Paris
or Bali or...

55:32.196 --> 55:34.129
I miss being on the road.

55:34.165 --> 55:36.332
I don't do well if I'm in
the same place for too long.

55:36.367 --> 55:38.934
Is that why you changed teams
so many times?

55:38.969 --> 55:41.403
That, and the owners of
those teams wanted me

55:41.439 --> 55:42.471
to be somewhere else.

55:42.506 --> 55:43.739
Ah.

55:43.774 --> 55:44.807
Chicken, egg.

55:44.842 --> 55:45.908
Right.

55:45.943 --> 55:47.343
Yeah.

55:47.411 --> 55:50.245
But maybe you were just
breaking up with them

55:50.281 --> 55:54.249
before they could break up
with you.

55:54.285 --> 55:55.250
Hmm.

55:55.286 --> 55:57.853
Maybe.

55:57.922 --> 55:59.355
So what else is in your future?

55:59.423 --> 56:02.291
Marriage? Children?
White picket fence?

56:02.326 --> 56:04.860
I guess that's the idea, yeah.

56:04.929 --> 56:06.328
What about you?

56:06.364 --> 56:09.865
Sometimes I wonder what it
would be like to have a son,

56:09.934 --> 56:12.801
or a daughter, I
could teach how to skate.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.670
Make sure they have
a good home.

56:14.739 --> 56:17.306
Good family.

56:17.341 --> 56:18.607
Be a good dad.

56:18.642 --> 56:21.477
I think you'd be a great dad.

56:21.512 --> 56:22.578
You think so?

56:22.613 --> 56:24.279
Yeah.

56:24.315 --> 56:26.315
I mean, you're a big kid.

56:26.350 --> 56:27.649
You'd have someone
to play with.

56:27.685 --> 56:28.784
[laughs]

56:28.819 --> 56:30.419
See?

56:30.454 --> 56:32.121
You were almost nice
to me there.

56:32.156 --> 56:33.789
That was close.

56:33.824 --> 56:35.290
Hey, Adam.

56:35.326 --> 56:37.070
I'm getting good at that shot
you showed me at practice.

56:37.094 --> 56:38.160
That's great.

56:38.195 --> 56:39.161
I'm looking forward
to seeing it.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.329
Practice?

56:40.364 --> 56:41.663
Oh, yeah.

56:41.699 --> 56:43.009
I've been helping out a little
bit with the team.

Oh, I'm not doing it
this year.

to make one.

57:00.418 --> 57:04.620
You know, Noah, Mary...
she's a little bit scared

57:04.655 --> 57:06.155
to ride down this hill.

57:06.190 --> 57:09.091
It's very icy.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.492
So maybe you could ride
with us?

57:10.528 --> 57:13.362

Mary, aren't you starting

What? No.

59:24.929 --> 59:26.428
What do you mean?

59:26.463 --> 59:28.864
I mean we wanted to improve
Adam's image

59:28.899 --> 59:30.343
and get more business
for the bookstore

59:30.367 --> 59:31.400
and we are doing both.

59:31.435 --> 59:32.875
Even Erica's starting
to come around.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.570
I may get the suspension lifted.

59:34.605 --> 59:35.704

Hmm? Yes.
What? No.

59:39.109 --> 59:41.376

isn't amazing?

59:41.412 --> 59:42.644
Oh, yes.

59:42.713 --> 59:46.615
That's-yeah, that's good.
That's really good.

59:46.650 --> 59:51.787
Hey, what's up with you today?

59:51.822 --> 59:55.457
Look, I'm happy that this
is going so well for Adam,

59:55.492 --> 59:56.792
I really am.

59:56.827 --> 59:59.628
But we have a long way
to go with the bookstore.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:02.464
Business is up, isn't it?

01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:03.465
It is, but-

01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:05.534
Not by enough.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:07.747
Well, that's why we're making
the 40th anniversary party

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.938
this Saturday such
a blow-out.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:13.809
We're talking the live podcast,
games, food...

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.477
we still could use
a showcase idea

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.879
but I think it's gonna be
a huge success.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.559
But aren't we worried about
it just being temporary?

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.550
I mean, we could sell a ton
of books that day

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:23.118
but how do we make it last?

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.731
Sales aren't the only thing
we're going for.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.755
You want to build
your customer base.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.091
Mailing list sign-ups,
podcast downloads,

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.425

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.069
It is, but...

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.271
What?

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:46.975
I was up late last night.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:50.145
I just couldn't sleep so I was
going over the numbers

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:58.214
and if this party doesn't work,
if it isn't a huge success...

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.989
we have to close the store.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:15.548
So how come you didn't tell me
how bad things are

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.705
at the store?

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.040
You have your own problems.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.386
I didn't-I didn't know
if you'd care.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.742
Of course I care.

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:24.613
I mean, we're in this together,
aren't we?

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:26.448
It's embarrassing.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:27.883
Oh, come on.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.218
A few days ago you were
flinging yourself down a hill.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:32.387
That person doesn't
get embarrassed.

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:35.290
Yeah, but that person is
also elusive, you know?

01:01:35.325 --> 01:01:38.326
She's not always there
when you need her.

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:40.228
We're gonna figure this out.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.242
Our number one mission is to
make sure the anniversary party

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:43.432
is a huge success.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:45.200
What about getting you
back on the team?

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.768
That'll happen.
I'm not worried.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:47.969
Erica's coming around.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.805
Yeah? You guys
are getting along?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.306
Yeah, sort of.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.642
Let's just say I don't feel
the need to search her hands

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:56.478
for weapons when
we meet anymore.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:57.646
Check my hands?

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:58.880
Constantly.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:01:59.748
I'm a little nervous
about that staple gun.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:00.916
You should be.

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.885
I don't think there's a safety.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.254
Why don't you and I go
for dinner tonight?

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.323
We can try to come up
with that showcase idea

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.592
and talk about the live podcast.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:13.428
You're not still nervous
about doing that, are you?

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:16.631
Get up in front of dozens
of strangers... just talk?

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700
No.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.135
Why would I be nervous?

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:23.105
The only thing that makes it
even a little bit ok

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.640
is knowing that you and Tyler

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.442
are going to be up there
with me.

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:30.645
I promise, we'll come up
with something brilliant.

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.148
So, dinner?

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.282
Yeah.

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:37.152
That would be-
that would be great.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.631
You're going out for dinner
with her?

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:39.933
I thought you said
you didn't like her.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.457
I don't not like her.

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:43.992
She just drives me crazy.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:45.327
Oh, here we go.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:46.728
What?

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.041
That's even worse than saying
she's not that bad,

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:50.565
and I heard you say those
exact words before.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.269
What usually comes next

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:55.904
is a completely
unhealthy relationship

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.773
with someone
you definitely shouldn't be with

01:02:57.808 --> 01:03:00.041
and then it ends in
yelling and in tears.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.777
A lot of tears.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.579
It's not true.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:05.714

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:06.749
Ok.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.083
Well, maybe I've changed.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.395
You're the one that keeps
telling me to grow up.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:10.652
It doesn't happen
over night.

01:03:10.721 --> 01:03:13.922

she's your soulmate

a miracle on you.

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:18.493
Is that what happened?

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:19.895
It's just a dinner.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.641
We're just gonna talk about
the anniversary party.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:22.964

I've got a dinner meeting.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:40.549
Yes, it's important.

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:41.883
Ok.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.986
Just let me make a quick call
and change first.

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:49.724

I just got called into

Erica.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:13.782
Is everything ok?

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:14.950
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:16.296
But I'm not sure how long
it's gonna take

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.153
so I didn't wanna leave
you hanging.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:19.487
Oh.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.056
Uh... alright.

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:22.924
Well, um... don't worry
about it.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.559
We can-we can just do it
another night.

01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:25.760
We don't need to cancel,
just-

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:27.929
It's not a big deal.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:30.065
It's fine.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.033
Well, ok.

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:34.102
I'm really sorry.

01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:35.704
<i>We'll talk tomorrow?</i>

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.038
Of course.

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:38.907
Bye.

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:53.722
What's going on?

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:56.658
I wanted to talk to you about
getting you back on the team.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:57.659
Really?

01:04:57.728 --> 01:04:58.994
Really.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.228
Erica, that's amazing.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.229
Fantastic.

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:02.430
Thank you.

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:03.932
Ok, don't get too excited.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:05.767
There are a few conditions.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:06.968
Name them.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:08.236
It's probationary.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:09.832
One wrong step and you have
to serve out

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:11.106
the rest of your suspension.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.107
Got it.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:13.353
Walking the straight
and narrow.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:14.809
It's a deal.

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:16.956
And we are throwing a party
for the VIP ticket-holders.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.480
Press will be there.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:20.548
So will my father.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.918
You'll have to get up in
front of all those people

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:25.287
and apologize
for your behaviour.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.621
Easy.

01:05:26.657 --> 01:05:27.756
Sorry I'm a jerk.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.090
Done.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.292
Adam.

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.427
You have to take this seriously.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.996
You need to eat a little crow
and then we'll get you back

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:37.799
on the team.

01:05:37.868 --> 01:05:40.869
I can do that.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:42.971
I can take it serious,
I promise.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
When is it?

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:47.309
Saturday.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:48.743
Wait, this Saturday?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:49.711
Mmmhmm.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:51.379
I can't.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:52.859
That's the night of the
bookstore's 40th anniversary.

01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:53.893
Well, you'll have to miss it.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.283
I can't.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.485
I'm emceeing the auction,
I'm signing autographs...

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.220
I'm doing a live Book Chat
with Mary.

01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:01.289
Adam, what's more important
to you?

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:04.626
This bookstore or your career?

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.932
I'll see you Saturday.

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:42.163
So... Mary... we're-
we're really excited

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.265
about the party Saturday night.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.734
Yeah.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.669
<i>It's gonna be great
for the big bookstore.</i>

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.604
I- I hope so.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:51.573
Yeah.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:59.814
Ok, what is it?

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.983
What do you mean?

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:03.985
You haven't said more than
ten words.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:05.653
Usually you've said more
than ten words

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.690
before you come in the door.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:10.091
You're-you're right.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:14.529
I have had a lot on my mind
but everything is fine.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.432
Ok, Tyler spill-

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:18.666
No. No.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:19.912
We don't need to drag me
into this.

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:21.236
Hey, it's a family dinner.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.172
You were dragged into it
by being born.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:26.174
[sighs]

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:39.621
The truth is there
is a lot riding on this, uh,

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.924
anniversary party.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.861
If it doesn't work we-we
will have to close the store.

01:07:47.964 --> 01:07:48.997
Oh, sweetheart.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.165
<i>Oh, Mary.</i>

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.168
This is not your fault.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.336
The store was struggling
when we retired.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.106
We even thought about
closing it to save you

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.408
from having to deal
with the responsibility.

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.811
We knew it was gonna happen
at some point.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:05.280
But I didn't.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:08.817
On the Same Page is not just
a responsibility.

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.285
It's our family.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.653
No, no.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.988
This is our family.

01:08:14.024 --> 01:08:15.523
Right here.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:19.861
And we will be here even if
the bookstore isn't, sweetheart.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.899
So you're not mad?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.336
How could we be mad at you?

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:34.676
Well, we're not done
trying yet.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.810
And the anniversary party
can still work.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:37.812
Mmmhmm.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:40.014
And Adam's helping out,
right?

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.317
I don't wanna have to count
on him.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:57.499
[door bells chime]

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:00.435
Hey, Adam.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.803
What're you doing here?

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:02.904
I was looking for Mary.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.404
I tried to call her.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.917
Oh yeah, no, she went down
to City Hall to get the permit

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:08.510
for tomorrow night's
Winterfest party.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:10.310
Well, when you see her will
you let her know

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.147
I really need to talk
to her please?

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:13.014
Sure.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.249
Thanks.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.850
Adam?

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:22.490
You've come a long way,
you know.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:24.658
How so?

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:28.328
Well, you've faced a lot of
challenges in your life.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:29.997
You're a good man,

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:33.568
and you've made such a positive
impact on Mary.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:38.473
This bookstore, this
is her entire world.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.841
Has been since she was
a little kid.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:42.143
And sometimes she forgets

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:44.845
there's a whole other world
out there,

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:48.349
but these last few weeks
she's been out having fun,

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.350
taking chances.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.654
Yeah, but a lot of the stuff
we did was

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.456
because Janet told us to.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.859
And you had no say
in the matter, huh?

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:59.160
Come on.

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:02.096
Adam, Mary wouldn't have
done all those things

01:10:02.132 --> 01:10:04.265
if she didn't want to.

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:09.237
And she certainly wouldn't
have done it alone.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:11.839
You have made an impact,
son.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:15.176
Whether you intended to
or not.

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:18.846
You're pretty good
with the impact yourself.

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.983
Yeah, and I do it
without a helmet.

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:24.319
[laughs]

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:26.421
Thanks, Paul.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:46.174
So I watched the game on TV last
night and I think it's possible

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:48.743
that number 16 is not getting
enough contact

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:51.779
with the ice
before he shoots.

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:54.015
Now you're a hockey expert?

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:56.417
I think I bring a fresh academic
perspective, yes.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:57.930
Because that's what you want
when you've got a bunch

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.288
of huge guys coming at you,
is an academic perspective.

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.623
Well, I think there's room

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.324
for a lot more than hit
with stick now.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.459
You're impossible.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:06.494
You're intractable.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:16.004
So... why did you ask me
to meet you here?

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:21.409
This place... it's my home.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.977
And I've really missed
it, but...

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:25.446
But what?

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:27.181
Out with it.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:30.184
The team is hosting a big
VIP event and they want me

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.955
to attend as a condition
for taking me back.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:36.524
That's great.
What's the problem?

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:38.660
It's tomorrow night.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:51.572
You have to do it.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.508
What about the
anniversary party?

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.276
Adam, it's your career.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:58.980
It's what you've been
doing all this for.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:00.815
I'm all over the advertising
for the party.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:01.961
I'm a big part of the event.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:02.950
If I don't show-

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:03.996
What, so now you're
so important

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.254
that it can't go on without you?

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:14.262
I know what you're
trying to do.

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:16.998
You're trying to make me mad
so I walk away from the party.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:24.972
You cannot pass up
the opportunity

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.508
to get back on the team.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:30.178
To get back on the road.

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:40.521
That's where all this leads,
anyway.

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:46.461
And yes, the anniversary
party might not work

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.731
without you but that's ok.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:55.937
I do think it's time for me
to succeed or fail on my own.

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:00.608
But you shouldn't have to.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:07.081
I got suspended because I wasn't
a good team player.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.684
But you and I, we're a team now,
too, right?

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:12.019
The best.

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:16.758
But sometimes being a good
team player means knowing

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:20.161
when to let the other guy
take the shot.

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.468
Take your shot, Adam.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.675
...She was sent from her
home in London, England.

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.111
London, England,
that's quite a ways away.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.746
Right?

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:13.881
So?

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:16.250
So, this is incredible.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:18.352
I mean, just look at
all these people.

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:19.999
We have sold more books
tonight than we have

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.589
in the past six months.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.258
But even more important,
you're building a customer base.

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:26.894
Between the Must Read List
and the photo shares

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.596
and the podcast downloads...

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:31.365
Mary, here's a statement
I never thought I'd say.

01:14:31.401 --> 01:14:32.266
Hmm?

01:14:32.335 --> 01:14:33.379
You're trending
on social media.

01:14:33.403 --> 01:14:35.770
[squeals]

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:36.671
What does that mean?

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:37.572
[laughs]

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.106
Trust me, it's good.

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:40.842
Ok.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:42.109
Hey, Ms. Campbell.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.110
Oh, hey Noah.

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:44.846
Where's Adam?

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:49.717
You know what?

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:50.930
He's not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.553
I'm sorry.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:54.021
Oh.

01:14:54.057 --> 01:14:55.590
But hey.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:57.236
How about I take a picture of
the two of you to send to him?

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.593
I bet he'd love it.

01:14:58.628 --> 01:14:59.760
Is that okay?

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:00.194
Ok.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:01.529
Alright.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.000
And... cheese.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:08.503
Perfect.

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:10.786
Where do I put my old book?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.073
Oh, just out front.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.652
You'll get a coupon you can
give to your mom

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.176
for 20 percent off, ok?

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:16.010
Great.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.712
Thanks.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:20.515
Ouch.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:22.917
I know.

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:25.219
I do love your book exchange
idea, though.

01:15:25.255 --> 01:15:27.221
I mean, give a book
to the library,

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:31.192
get a discount on a new one,
that is a showcase idea.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:34.195
Oh, that's not
the showcase idea.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.397
Adam took care of that.

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:44.505
He was gonna tell you
himself tonight

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.841
but since he's not here...

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.380
Oh.

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:56.450
It's-it's so nice.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.553
But I don't get it.

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:00.621
Look on the other side.

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:07.395
Oh.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.863
That's lovely.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.676
So what, he got these made
up for the anniversary party?

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:15.736
No, he had 20,000 made for
the Royals' next home game.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:19.707
On the Same Page is the official
sponsor of the fan giveaway

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.720
and he's made sure that the
bookstore will be featured

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:26.547
throughout the game
and during its telecast.

01:16:29.519 --> 01:16:32.353
That's incredibly generous.

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:44.198
Am I still smiling?

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.199
I can't feel my face.

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:46.434
You're doing fine.

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:48.336
No sign of the Adam that
argues with referees.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.771
Well, I hope he's gone
for good.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.573
I hope so, too.

01:16:53.443 --> 01:16:55.009
I'm getting positive
feedback.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:57.612
My father is pleased.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:01.549
That's how your father looks
when he's pleased?

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:02.883
Yeah.

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.919
It made report card time
very confusing as a kid.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:07.021
[chuckles]

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.356
Circulate.

01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:09.457
Go circulate.

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.292
Right.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.329
Thank you for being here.

01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:17.198
Of course.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.033
Part of being a team player.

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.871
[message alert]

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:44.859
Pretty impressive.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.172
We're gonna start the Book
Chat shortly.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.196
Are you ready?

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:49.563
I'm nervous.

01:17:49.599 --> 01:17:50.931
What do I always tell you?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.833
You're not nervous,
you care.

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:53.601
You're right.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:54.502
Right.

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:56.604
I care a lot.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:59.373
But you know, there's also a
part of me that kinda can't wait

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:02.743
to get out there
and I can do this.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:04.278
I think I'm gonna lead
this one.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.680
What?

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:07.226
Who are you and what
have you done with my sister?

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.182
Ha ha.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:09.850
I'll tell you who she is.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.619
She's somebody who should
be very proud

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.287
of what she's
accomplished.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:14.889
Dad...

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:17.559
Thanks, dad.

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:19.360
Yeah.

01:18:21.631 --> 01:18:23.698
You know, I think
On the Same Page

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:25.666
just might make it after all.

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.669
I'm not talking about
the store.

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:33.541
[applause]

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:36.410
I'd like to introduce one
of our best players,

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:39.246
and certainly one
of our most colourful.

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:42.083
But he's worked hard
in the last month

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:45.119
and I think you've seen the
results of that in the press.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:49.457
I personally have seen how
he's changed for the better.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:52.226
Ladies and gentlemen,
Adam Clayborn.

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:58.265
[applause]

01:18:58.334 --> 01:19:00.835
Thank you, everyone,
for coming out to support

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:04.371
the 40th anniversary
of On the Same Page!

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:06.874
[cheering]

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.910
I am thrilled to introduce
one of the owners

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:14.248
and the driving force behind
why we're all here tonight,

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.217
Mary Campbell.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.452
[cheering]

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:19.720
Thank you.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.956
Thank you.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:29.096
There are a bunch of things
I'm sorry about.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:33.834
My past behaviour is one.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.270
It affected the team
and my overall image

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:38.272
within the community.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.241
I'm doing my best
to fix that.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:44.912
On the Same Page has been
here for 40 years.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:48.182
[cheering]

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:52.520
I must say I'm realizing that
being part of a community,

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:53.954
being part of a team,

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:57.291
it's-it's about more
than just being present.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.593
I'm proud of this team.

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:02.429
And I'm proud to be
a member of it.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:06.033
I think I forgot for a while
what real teamwork looked like.

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:09.770
I always say that the entire
world is right there

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.172
in that bookstore.

01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:13.741
And sometimes I think
I do forget

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:17.077
that the entire world
is out there, too.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:20.447
Erica said that she thinks
I've changed for the better.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:22.750
I hope that's true.

01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:25.186
I think it is.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:33.694
As much as I love this game...

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:38.699
I've realized now what's
also really important.

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:42.937
So please excuse me,
but I have to go get it.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:53.380
[applause]

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:56.717
Adam!

01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:59.386
If you leave I don't know
if my father will forgive you.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:01.789
If I don't leave I won't be able
to forgive myself.

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:04.959
You're risking
your entire career.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.840
Well, I hope that I'll be able
to prove to some other team

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:11.498
that I am that better person
I've been trying to be.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.568
That is, if I can't convince
you first.

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.608
Let's talk about this Monday.

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:23.377
You're gonna be late.

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:31.785
For the record,
you broke up with me.

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:33.854
Thank you.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:41.729
I have been having the close
to home kind of adventures.

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:44.498
They haven't all gone well,

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:49.270
but as someone very smart
once told me,

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:52.907
it doesn't matter how many times
you fall down.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:56.510
It only matters how many times
you get back up again.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:58.846
It is in that spirit of
adventure that I would like

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:01.949
to kick off tonight's book chat.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:07.254
How many of you have read
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer?

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.789
Oh good.

01:22:08.858 --> 01:22:14.461
I'm so glad because this is
one of my very favourite books.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.363
You say that about
every book.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:22.703
[cheering]

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:24.538
What're you doing here?

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:26.607
I just came to chat
about a book.

01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:28.943
But what about getting back
on the team and-

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:31.712
Maybe it's time I started
thinking about what's next.

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:33.180
'Cause apparently I come up

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:35.783
with really incredible
business ideas.

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:37.418
[crowd laughs]

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.552
Really?

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:39.620
I'm quite good at it.

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:40.921
Hmm.

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:43.424
In fact, most of this party
here was my idea.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:44.959
[crowd laughs]

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:47.795
Why don't we just talk
about the book?

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:50.664
That's a great idea.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.567
'Cause this is a story
I don't want to end.

01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:55.536
<i>[crowd]
Awe.</i>

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:57.938
Me neither.

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:07.514
