00:25.125 --> 00:27.876
I carry with me the
burden of having seen

00:27.918 --> 00:30.584
man's inhumanity to man in ways

00:30.626 --> 00:33.459
which are incredible
to a rational mind,

00:33.500 --> 00:35.792
and that will always
remain with me.

00:39.542 --> 00:40.876
<i>I am Ben Ferencz.</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:48.000
<i>70 years ago,
I was a prosecutor at the.</i>

00:48.001 --> 00:50.021
<i>Nuremberg Trials,
in what was certainly</i>

00:50.022 --> 00:52.000
<i>the biggest murder
trial in history.</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:56.876
Ben Ferencz is an icon, really

00:56.918 --> 00:59.667
in international
criminal justice.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.751
<i>We're talking about
a</i> man whose career

01:02.792 --> 01:04.667
<i>spans seven decades.</i>

01:06.792 --> 01:08.855
<i>This trial, well what</i>

01:08.856 --> 01:10.918
<i>was most significant about it</i>

01:10.959 --> 01:12.876
<i>was it gave us an insight</i>

01:12.918 --> 01:16.000
<i>into the mentality
of mass murderers.</i>

01:16.042 --> 01:17.751
<i>They had murdered
over a million people,</i>

01:17.792 --> 01:19.501
<i>including hundreds of thousands</i>

01:19.502 --> 01:21.209
<i>of children in cold blood.</i>

01:23.292 --> 01:25.667
Ben is the personification

01:25.668 --> 01:28.042
of the international do-gooder.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.834
Somebody who has no goal in life

01:30.876 --> 01:33.230
<i>other than to bring</i>

01:33.231 --> 01:35.584
<i>justice to an unjust world.</i>

01:35.626 --> 01:39.125
My Dad used to ask
us, and I kid you not,

01:39.167 --> 01:42.417
around the dinner
table every night,

01:42.459 --> 01:45.334
"What have you done
for mankind today?"

01:47.292 --> 01:49.250
<i>War can make murderers</i>

01:49.292 --> 01:51.792
<i>out of otherwise decent people.</i>

01:52.959 --> 01:54.084
<i>That may come as a shock</i>

01:54.085 --> 01:55.209
<i>to some of the viewers</i>

01:55.250 --> 01:56.959
<i>who perceive these mass</i>

01:56.960 --> 01:58.667
<i>murderers as horrible beasts.</i>

01:59.751 --> 02:00.751
<i>Not so.</i>

02:03.250 --> 02:04.751
At such a young age,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.876
in such a critical
moment in modern history

02:07.918 --> 02:09.250
to be in the thick of things,

02:09.292 --> 02:10.709
to do the right thing with

02:10.710 --> 02:12.125
conviction and courage,

02:12.167 --> 02:14.626
<i>and to have witnessed
what he had witnessed</i>

02:14.667 --> 02:15.855
<i>and turned that into a</i>

02:15.856 --> 02:17.042
<i>positive contribution</i>

02:17.083 --> 02:19.000
<i>for a better humanity.</i>

02:19.042 --> 02:20.417
It's really something to

02:20.418 --> 02:21.792
admire and try to emulate.

02:23.918 --> 02:26.292
<i>The impact of
war itself on people</i>

02:26.334 --> 02:28.543
<i>affected me so that I</i>

02:28.544 --> 02:30.751
<i>wanted to stop war-making,</i>

02:31.876 --> 02:33.814
<i>and have in fact devoted most</i>

02:33.815 --> 02:35.751
<i>of my life in that effort</i>

02:35.792 --> 02:38.083
<i>to try and create a
more humane world.</i>

02:40.500 --> 02:42.626
His humanity and his compassion

02:42.667 --> 02:44.938
and his fearless commitment

02:44.939 --> 02:47.209
to justice all of these years

02:47.250 --> 02:48.938
make him one of the most

02:48.939 --> 02:50.626
important figures of our time.

03:32.292 --> 03:35.125
I'm mindful of the
fact that the world

03:35.167 --> 03:37.043
has always been torn apart

03:37.044 --> 03:38.918
by the type of horror

03:38.959 --> 03:41.584
which is featured on TV,

03:41.626 --> 03:44.542
but I'm also always
mindful of the fact

03:44.584 --> 03:46.250
that we are, believe it or not,

03:46.292 --> 03:48.667
making very significant progress

03:48.709 --> 03:49.959
toward creating a more

03:49.960 --> 03:51.209
humane and peaceful world.

03:57.209 --> 04:01.000
Okay,
Ben Ferencz welcome it says.

04:05.125 --> 04:08.500
<i>Ben is someone who
is very driven,</i>

04:08.542 --> 04:10.375
<i>who is extremely passionate,</i>

04:10.417 --> 04:13.042
<i>and has an absolutely
unshakeable belief</i>

04:13.083 --> 04:16.084
in the rule of law and
in international law

04:16.084 --> 04:17.750
that's what drives him.

04:17.791 --> 04:22.209
He is somebody who
thrives on this passion

04:22.250 --> 04:24.792
and thrives on the effort to

04:24.834 --> 04:26.209
try to move things forward

04:26.210 --> 04:27.584
that seem impossible.

04:29.042 --> 04:32.751
<i>When I was a boy or a student,</i>

04:32.792 --> 04:35.042
<i>there was no such
thing as human rights.</i>

04:35.083 --> 04:36.375
<i>There was no such thing</i>

04:36.376 --> 04:37.667
<i>as international courts.</i>

04:38.918 --> 04:40.397
<i>No one heard of the word</i>

04:40.398 --> 04:41.876
<i>genocide for one thing,</i>

04:41.918 --> 04:43.314
and I was the first I

04:43.315 --> 04:44.709
believe to use that word

04:44.751 --> 04:47.000
in the opening paragraph
of an indictment

04:47.042 --> 04:49.042
- where I was the chief.
- Prosecutor at Nuremberg.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.584
<i>Benjamin Ferencz is the titan</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:57.250
<i>of international
criminal prosecutions.</i>

04:57.292 --> 05:00.792
<i>He really established
an incredible</i>

05:02.167 --> 05:04.376
mandate for international

05:04.377 --> 05:06.584
criminal responsibility

05:06.626 --> 05:09.000
for the commission of crimes

05:09.042 --> 05:12.375
against humanity and war crimes.

05:12.417 --> 05:17.000
He laid out a legal
process that has become

05:17.042 --> 05:19.542
a very important one, taking

05:19.543 --> 05:22.042
us into the 21st Century.

05:24.042 --> 05:25.542
<i>I'd never tried a case.</i>

05:25.584 --> 05:27.626
<i>- I'd never been in a.
- Criminal court in my life.</i>

05:27.667 --> 05:29.334
<i>I was 27 years old.</i>

05:30.709 --> 05:31.980
<i>But I knew at the beginning</i>

05:31.981 --> 05:34.438
<i>that if this trial</i>
is going to have any

05:34.439 --> 05:35.584
significance at all,

05:35.626 --> 05:37.689
it has to set a model of what

05:37.690 --> 05:39.751
you should and shouldn't do.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.541
This is a "Order National."

05:41.542 --> 05:45.751
De La Legion d'Honneur,
Presidente de la.

05:45.752 --> 05:47.542
Republique Francaise...

05:47.584 --> 05:49.334
Names me a "Chevalier"

05:49.335 --> 05:51.083
de la Legion d'Honneur".

05:51.125 --> 05:53.250
That gold medal you
see hanging there

05:53.292 --> 05:55.751
is the Medal of
Freedom which I was

05:55.792 --> 05:57.834
particularly glad to receive

05:57.876 --> 06:00.542
because the previous
recipient of that

06:00.584 --> 06:02.272
had been Nelson Mandela, and

06:02.273 --> 06:03.959
I was a strong admirer of his.

06:07.876 --> 06:10.147
<i>I was told that I'd make a</i>

06:10.148 --> 06:12.417
<i>good lawyer or a good crook,</i>

06:13.542 --> 06:14.876
<i>and I didn't quite understand it</i>

06:14.918 --> 06:17.375
<i>'cause I didn't know
what a lawyer was,</i>

06:17.417 --> 06:18.792
but I knew what the crook was

06:18.834 --> 06:21.334
and I didn't care
for it at any time,

06:21.375 --> 06:23.167
so I think that
may have tilted me

06:23.209 --> 06:24.564
toward wanting to be a

06:24.565 --> 06:25.918
lawyer, whatever that meant.

06:29.959 --> 06:32.209
<i>My sister was born in the</i>

06:32.210 --> 06:34.459
<i>same bed I was later born in.</i>

06:36.000 --> 06:39.542
<i>When she was born,
she was a Hungarian.</i>

06:39.584 --> 06:41.209
<i>When I was born about 18</i>

06:41.210 --> 06:42.834
<i>months later, I was a Romanian.</i>

06:44.792 --> 06:46.042
It doesn't really matter

06:46.043 --> 06:47.292
what you call the country.

06:47.334 --> 06:49.043
What matters is how you treat

06:49.044 --> 06:50.751
the people in the country,

06:50.792 --> 06:53.000
and in both Hungary and Romania,

06:53.042 --> 06:54.751
they persecuted the Jews.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.688
<i>So it was prudent for my parents</i>

06:56.689 --> 06:58.584
<i>to get out if they could.</i>

07:01.834 --> 07:03.897
<i>We traveled third class because</i>

07:03.898 --> 07:05.959
<i>there was no fourth class.</i>

07:06.959 --> 07:09.480
<i>Sleeping on an open deck in</i>

07:09.481 --> 07:12.000
<i>midwinter in 1920 was not easy.</i>

07:14.792 --> 07:17.188
<i>I was crying all the time</i>

07:17.189 --> 07:19.584
<i>because my mother had no milk.</i>

07:19.626 --> 07:21.251
<i>My father was being driven</i>

07:21.252 --> 07:22.876
<i>crazy with this noise.</i>

07:22.918 --> 07:24.083
He couldn't sleep.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.918
He was very tempted
to throw me overboard.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.355
And there's been some

07:28.356 --> 07:30.938
indication that he
would've had he not been

07:30.939 --> 07:32.083
interrupted by my uncle

07:32.125 --> 07:33.709
who was traveling with us.

07:37.626 --> 07:39.105
<i>My father was trained as</i>

07:39.106 --> 07:40.584
<i>an apprentice shoemaker.</i>

07:40.626 --> 07:42.834
<i>He thought when he
gets to New York,</i>

07:42.876 --> 07:44.834
<i>he'll be able to make
boots for the people.</i>

07:44.876 --> 07:46.167
<i>No one told him there were</i>

07:46.209 --> 07:49.500
<i>no cowboys in New
York and no cows.</i>

07:49.542 --> 07:51.751
<i>So he found himself
unemployable,</i>

07:51.792 --> 07:54.042
<i>no money, no friends.</i>

07:56.792 --> 07:58.292
It was a tough life,

07:58.293 --> 07:59.792
but they didn't know it

07:59.834 --> 08:01.272
because where they'd

08:01.273 --> 08:02.709
come from it was tougher,

08:02.751 --> 08:04.959
so it was an improvement
no matter what.

08:08.918 --> 08:12.417
<i>This was an area known
as Hell's Kitchen.</i>

08:12.459 --> 08:14.689
<i>It got that name because it</i>

08:14.690 --> 08:16.918
<i>was a high crime density area.</i>

08:16.959 --> 08:19.626
<i>When I became a criminologist</i>

08:19.627 --> 08:22.417
<i>I found that out by
seeing maps of where</i>

08:19.667 --> 08:23.792
<i>the most crime was in
parts of the world.</i>

08:23.834 --> 08:24.918
<i>It was right at home.</i>

08:26.292 --> 08:28.438
It was a tough neighborhood,

08:28.439 --> 08:30.584
Irish and Italian.

08:31.751 --> 08:34.292
<i>With a lot of gang
warfare going on,</i>

08:34.333 --> 08:37.626
<i>but it was no guns, no knives.</i>

08:37.667 --> 08:39.375
<i>It was just you know
beating each other up</i>

08:39.417 --> 08:41.708
<i>or playing craps
on the sidewalk.</i>

08:44.918 --> 08:46.751
<i>I didn't speak English at all.</i>

08:46.792 --> 08:50.125
<i>I spoke Yiddish was
the mother tongue.</i>

08:50.167 --> 08:51.917
<i>My father took me to school,</i>

08:51.918 --> 08:53.667
<i>public school to enroll me.</i>

08:53.709 --> 08:54.751
<i>They wouldn't take me</i>

08:54.752 --> 08:55.792
<i>because I was too small,</i>

08:55.834 --> 08:58.022
I couldn't speak English, and

08:58.023 --> 09:00.209
they said come back next year.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.918
Next year they said
the same thing,

09:01.959 --> 09:03.647
so I finally ended up when

09:03.648 --> 09:05.334
my parents were divorced

09:05.375 --> 09:07.918
and I went to live with

09:07.919 --> 09:11.334
an aunt in Brooklyn,
that's where I started

09:07.959 --> 09:11.334
my educational career.

09:14.918 --> 09:17.126
<i>My eighth grade teacher in</i>

09:17.127 --> 09:19.334
<i>public school 80 in the Bronx,</i>

09:19.375 --> 09:22.001
<i>I was then living back
again with my mother</i>

09:22.002 --> 09:23.042
<i>and my stepfather.</i>

09:23.083 --> 09:25.001
<i>She asked me to bring</i>

09:25.002 --> 09:26.918
<i>my father and mother in.</i>

09:26.959 --> 09:28.083
<i>She wanted to talk to them</i>

09:28.125 --> 09:30.626
<i>and we had a little conference.</i>

09:32.834 --> 09:35.063
<i>The teacher explained</i>

09:35.064 --> 09:37.292
<i>that this is a gifted boy,</i>

09:37.334 --> 09:39.292
<i>and he should go to college.</i>

09:39.334 --> 09:41.310
<i>- Well certainly she didn't.
- Know and I didn't know.</i>

09:41.334 --> 09:43.272
What a gifted boy meant,

09:43.273 --> 09:45.209
'cause we never got any gifts

09:45.250 --> 09:46.563
and I didn't know anybody

09:46.564 --> 09:47.876
who ever went to college.

09:47.918 --> 09:52.125
This was beyond our
knowledge range,

09:52.167 --> 09:54.043
and my mother said well

09:54.044 --> 09:57.001
whatever you want to
do, you know she would

09:57.002 --> 09:58.042
accommodate that.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.751
<i>The Townsend Harris High School</i>

10:03.792 --> 10:04.896
<i>which was the only one of</i>

10:04.897 --> 10:06.813
<i>its kind in the
country where if you</i>

10:06.814 --> 10:08.709
<i>graduated from there
you were automatically</i>

10:08.710 --> 10:09.792
<i>admitted to City College.</i>

10:12.959 --> 10:15.000
<i>I never had to study before.</i>

10:15.042 --> 10:16.834
<i>I heard something and I knew it,</i>

10:16.876 --> 10:18.501
<i>and it was just you know it</i>

10:18.502 --> 10:20.125
<i>seemed to be quite automatic,</i>

10:20.167 --> 10:21.522
<i>but when I got to this</i>

10:21.523 --> 10:22.876
<i>advanced high school,</i>

10:22.918 --> 10:25.168
I flunked the two subjects

10:25.169 --> 10:27.417
of French and algebra.

10:27.459 --> 10:32.209
<i>So I found out there
was a movie house</i>

10:32.250 --> 10:33.750
<i>featuring foreign films</i>

10:33.751 --> 10:37.667
<i>right near where we
live and I went there,</i>

10:37.668 --> 10:40.876
<i>and fell in love with
the French actress.</i>

10:40.877 --> 10:42.959
<i>Danielle Darrieux,
and she was being</i>

10:40.918 --> 10:42.959
<i>wooed by Charles Boyer</i>

10:43.918 --> 10:45.334
<i>and I could hear
them and I could</i>

10:45.375 --> 10:47.500
<i>read in English what
they were saying.</i>

10:47.542 --> 10:49.542
<i>That was a wonderful
teaching tool,</i>

10:49.584 --> 10:50.730
<i>except I came out speaking</i>

10:50.731 --> 10:51.876
<i>like Charles Boyer.</i>

10:56.292 --> 10:58.022
And all that, and that

10:58.023 --> 10:59.751
was very good in French.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.959
Spoke like a Frenchman.

11:05.417 --> 11:06.876
<i>City College.</i>

11:06.918 --> 11:07.959
<i>It was known as the poor</i>

11:07.960 --> 11:09.000
<i>man's Harvard actually.</i>

11:09.042 --> 11:10.876
<i>I didn't know that at the time,</i>

11:10.918 --> 11:12.189
<i>but it was a very tough school</i>

11:12.190 --> 11:13.459
<i>for a lot of tough kids,</i>

11:13.500 --> 11:16.000
<i>mostly Jewish kids who couldn't</i>

11:16.001 --> 11:18.500
<i>afford a college education.</i>

11:19.334 --> 11:20.918
It was a very good school.

11:20.959 --> 11:22.793
Taught me there first

11:22.794 --> 11:24.626
of all, I have to study.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.250
Secondly there's a
lot I have to learn

11:26.292 --> 11:27.876
and I think I did.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.500
<i>You had to decide
what you wanted to do</i>

11:33.542 --> 11:35.626
<i>while you were still in college,</i>

11:35.667 --> 11:36.772
<i>and most of my friends were</i>

11:36.773 --> 11:37.876
<i>going into civil service</i>

11:37.918 --> 11:39.918
<i>or something like that.</i>

11:39.959 --> 11:41.834
<i>I wanted to go into
crime prevention</i>

11:41.876 --> 11:44.188
<i>because I'd seen enough crime</i>

11:44.189 --> 11:46.500
<i>and I've seen juvenile crime</i>

11:46.542 --> 11:49.000
<i>so I was focusing on
juvenile delinquency.</i>

11:53.834 --> 11:55.959
<i>I didn't know anything about</i>

11:55.960 --> 11:58.083
<i>college, about law schools</i>

11:58.125 --> 12:01.876
<i>and I inquired "What's
the best school?"</i>

12:01.918 --> 12:03.355
<i>And I heard that Harvard is</i>

12:03.356 --> 12:04.792
<i>the best school, not Brooklyn.</i>

12:05.792 --> 12:07.768
- All right, so I sent a.
- Letter to Harvard applying.

12:07.792 --> 12:11.083
And lo and behold,
I was accepted.

12:12.626 --> 12:16.542
<i>I had done so well on
my criminal law exam</i>

12:16.584 --> 12:17.917
<i>that they gave me a</i>

12:17.918 --> 12:19.250
<i>scholarship based on that.</i>

12:19.292 --> 12:21.209
<i>Otherwise I could
never ever afford to.</i>

12:22.751 --> 12:24.209
<i>I realized that there were</i>

12:24.210 --> 12:25.667
<i>different classes of people</i>

12:25.709 --> 12:27.918
<i>and the students who
got up and said "Sir"</i>

12:27.959 --> 12:29.834
<i>every time they
asked him a question,</i>

12:29.876 --> 12:31.584
which seemed to me very strange,

12:31.626 --> 12:34.397
and who wore loafers and

12:34.398 --> 12:37.167
no socks or argyle socks

12:37.209 --> 12:38.480
and went punting on

12:38.481 --> 12:39.751
the Charles on the weekend.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.250
This was another world,

12:41.292 --> 12:43.332
<i>- and they had fraternities.
- And things like that.</i>

12:44.334 --> 12:46.125
<i>I had a few friends
from City College</i>

12:46.167 --> 12:48.480
<i>who also went to Harvard,</i>

12:48.481 --> 12:50.792
<i>and I palled around with them,</i>

12:50.834 --> 12:52.334
but that was another social

12:52.335 --> 12:53.834
world at Harvard itself.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.542
<i>I found a program
in the government</i>

12:58.584 --> 12:59.976
<i>where if you were
working for a professor</i>

13:00.000 --> 13:01.334
<i>they gave you a stipend.</i>

13:01.375 --> 13:03.876
<i>I had no money,
I had no money at all.</i>

13:03.918 --> 13:05.918
Roscoe Pound I
particularly admired.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.751
He was known for
his jurisprudence.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.209
<i>He was an old man.</i>

13:10.250 --> 13:12.042
<i>He could hardly see,
he had an eye shade</i>

13:12.083 --> 13:14.667
<i>and I wanted to work for him.</i>

13:15.584 --> 13:17.000
He said "No,
I can't accept that."

13:17.042 --> 13:18.376
"It has to go through my

13:18.377 --> 13:19.709
"brain," he said, his brain.

13:19.751 --> 13:21.810
- "I can't get it go through.
- Somebody else's brain."

13:21.834 --> 13:23.626
So he turned me down.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.751
So I went to see
the next professor

13:25.792 --> 13:27.146
that I was interested

13:27.147 --> 13:28.500
in was Sheldon Glueck.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.918
He was the only one
who taught criminology

13:30.959 --> 13:33.101
<i>- and his first question.
- "How much is it gonna cost?"</i>

13:33.125 --> 13:34.459
<i>I said it's free.</i>

13:34.500 --> 13:35.834
<i>He said "I'll take it."</i>

13:36.834 --> 13:39.542
<i>So I became an assistant to him</i>

13:39.584 --> 13:41.834
<i>and when the war had broken out,</i>

13:41.876 --> 13:44.626
<i>he began to study war crimes.</i>

13:44.667 --> 13:46.226
<i>- So his first assignment.
- Was get me everything.</i>

13:46.250 --> 13:47.959
<i>In the Harvard law library</i>

13:47.960 --> 13:49.667
<i>that relates to war crimes.</i>

13:49.709 --> 13:52.125
<i>That became more relevant</i>

13:52.126 --> 13:55.375
<i>because I suspect,</i>
I don't know that when

13:52.167 --> 13:55.416
the army turned to
him he was consulting

13:55.417 --> 13:56.709
with the Pentagon.

13:56.751 --> 13:58.292
They turned to him
because he'd written

13:58.334 --> 13:59.876
these books on war crimes.

14:01.209 --> 14:03.226
- That he said go find Benny,
- he's out there somewhere.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.667
And they tapped me and they

14:05.668 --> 14:08.083
sent me to Patton's headquarters

14:08.125 --> 14:09.438
and they said your name has

14:09.439 --> 14:10.751
been forwarded from Washington.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.188
So I can only imagine that

14:12.189 --> 14:13.584
it came from Sheldon Glueck.

14:24.792 --> 14:26.355
<i>What opened my eyes was</i>

14:26.356 --> 14:27.918
<i>of course the headlines.</i>

14:27.959 --> 14:29.918
<i>- Newspapers they were.
- Murdering all the Jews.</i>

14:29.959 --> 14:31.834
I said how can I sabotage

14:31.835 --> 14:33.709
the German government?

14:33.751 --> 14:35.417
And so what I did was I

14:35.418 --> 14:37.083
wrote to the local consulate

14:37.125 --> 14:40.167
and I said please,
I'd like to disseminate

14:40.209 --> 14:41.709
some of your literature to

14:41.710 --> 14:43.209
justify Hitler and so on

14:43.250 --> 14:45.250
and they sent me piles and piles

14:45.292 --> 14:48.292
of propaganda,
absolute propaganda.

14:48.334 --> 14:50.542
I took them and threw
them in the garbage.

14:50.584 --> 14:52.084
That was my form of sabotage

14:52.085 --> 14:53.584
against the German government.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.500
<i>The war broke out, and I</i>

15:02.501 --> 15:04.000
<i>went with everybody I knew</i>

15:04.042 --> 15:05.292
<i>to try and volunteer at the</i>

15:05.334 --> 15:07.459
<i>different branches
of the service,</i>

15:07.500 --> 15:08.584
<i>and most of them they</i>

15:08.585 --> 15:09.667
<i>wouldn't take me at all.</i>

15:11.167 --> 15:12.938
As an Air Force pilot they said

15:12.939 --> 15:14.709
I couldn't reach the pedals.

15:14.751 --> 15:16.293
A navigator they said if

15:16.294 --> 15:17.834
I'd been told to bomb Berlin

15:17.876 --> 15:19.334
I'd end up in Tokyo.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.750
As a paratrooper they said

15:20.751 --> 15:22.125
you'll go up instead of down.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.042
<i>'Cause there was a desperate</i>

15:26.043 --> 15:27.480
<i>need for my skills,
I was furious,</i>

15:27.481 --> 15:28.876
<i>absolutely furious</i>

15:28.918 --> 15:30.292
<i>because they wouldn't take me.</i>

15:30.334 --> 15:32.626
<i>I asked myself what can</i>

15:32.627 --> 15:34.918
<i>I do to be of most help?</i>

15:34.959 --> 15:36.772
<i>And because I could speak.</i>

15:36.773 --> 15:38.584
<i>French like a Frenchman,</i>

15:38.626 --> 15:39.772
<i>I thought if they can</i>

15:39.773 --> 15:40.918
<i>drop me behind the lines</i>

15:40.959 --> 15:42.688
in occupied France and teach

15:42.689 --> 15:44.417
me how to use dynamite,

15:44.459 --> 15:45.668
I'll be able to blow up

15:45.669 --> 15:46.876
all the German trains

15:46.918 --> 15:48.125
and communication lines.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.918
They'll wish they
were back in Berlin.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.188
<i>And ended up finally as a</i>

15:52.189 --> 15:54.417
<i>buck private in the artillery</i>

15:54.459 --> 15:56.334
<i>about which I knew
absolutely nothing.</i>

15:56.375 --> 15:58.125
<i>As a typist in a supply room.</i>

15:58.167 --> 15:59.584
<i>I couldn't even type and they</i>

15:59.585 --> 16:01.000
<i>never taught me how to type.</i>

16:01.042 --> 16:03.876
<i>So the dumbest things
you could possibly do</i>

16:03.918 --> 16:05.397
<i>with a guy who's eager</i>

16:05.398 --> 16:06.876
<i>to serve, they did to me.</i>

16:08.209 --> 16:09.792
And I've never forgiven them.

16:13.417 --> 16:17.876
<i>We were trained to shoot down</i>

16:17.918 --> 16:19.334
<i>high flying planes.</i>

16:19.375 --> 16:21.167
<i>That was going to
be our mission.</i>

16:24.000 --> 16:27.626
I am of the firm
opinion today still

16:27.667 --> 16:29.751
that we shot down more American

16:29.792 --> 16:32.375
and British planes
than German planes.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.042
<i>I had an assignment, we all did,</i>

16:37.459 --> 16:38.543
<i>and when we see an.</i>

16:38.544 --> 16:39.626
<i>American plane coming over</i>

16:39.667 --> 16:41.500
<i>and he doesn't give
us the correct signal,</i>

16:41.542 --> 16:43.709
<i>friend or foe, bum bum bum</i>

16:43.751 --> 16:45.542
<i>you hit the plane
and it explodes.</i>

16:45.584 --> 16:47.334
<i>I never go to see fireworks.</i>

16:47.375 --> 16:48.542
<i>I've seen 'em.</i>

16:48.584 --> 16:51.834
The whole sky is
brightened, and then we go

16:51.876 --> 16:53.397
each one of us soldiers

16:53.398 --> 16:54.918
carrying a little cardboard box,

16:54.959 --> 16:57.667
walking hip to
hip trying to find

16:57.709 --> 16:59.792
a piece of finger to
identify the body.

17:01.459 --> 17:02.834
<i>Find out who the hell is what.</i>

17:02.876 --> 17:04.314
<i>We knew it was an American</i>

17:04.315 --> 17:05.751
<i>plane by that time,</i>

17:05.791 --> 17:07.501
<i>but you got to report to next</i>

17:07.502 --> 17:09.209
<i>of kin that the guy's dead.</i>

17:10.834 --> 17:13.000
<i>Smashed to smithereens.</i>

17:13.041 --> 17:14.416
<i>The engine would still be,</i>

17:14.417 --> 17:15.791
<i>you know, partly intact</i>

17:15.834 --> 17:17.792
but to find a finger was

17:17.794 --> 17:19.751
already a great discovery.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.126
I found several fingers or

17:21.127 --> 17:22.459
you find a clump of hair.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.000
You put it in the box,
you send it back to

17:23.791 --> 17:25.000
the adjutant general

17:25.041 --> 17:26.438
let 'em work it over and

17:26.439 --> 17:27.834
notify the next of kin.

17:27.876 --> 17:29.000
It's war.

17:33.918 --> 17:35.250
<i>I tell ya', I didn't stop</i>

17:35.292 --> 17:37.834
<i>and ask myself what's
my emotional state?</i>

17:37.876 --> 17:39.792
<i>I asked myself what's next?</i>

17:39.834 --> 17:42.000
<i>Move move, you know?</i>

17:46.292 --> 17:47.876
<i>There's no time for emotion.</i>

17:47.918 --> 17:49.876
<i>No time for being shocked for</i>

17:49.877 --> 17:51.834
<i>tears or anything like that.</i>

17:57.834 --> 18:00.500
<i>My final assignment in the army</i>

18:00.542 --> 18:03.000
<i>was to be a war
crimes investigator</i>

18:03.042 --> 18:04.897
<i>entering the concentration</i>

18:04.898 --> 18:06.751
<i>camps as they were liberated</i>

18:06.792 --> 18:08.105
<i>in order to collect</i>

18:08.106 --> 18:09.417
<i>evidence for the crimes.</i>

18:13.042 --> 18:15.667
<i>We get a report
into headquarters.</i>

18:15.709 --> 18:17.751
<i>Attack battalion so and</i>

18:17.752 --> 18:21.293
<i>so has come upon a
scene where there are</i>

18:21.294 --> 18:23.917
<i>people walking out
of looks like a work</i>

18:23.918 --> 18:25.042
<i>camp of some kind.</i>

18:25.083 --> 18:26.396
<i>They're all dressed in</i>

18:26.397 --> 18:28.772
<i>something like
pajamas and looks like</i>

18:28.773 --> 18:29.792
<i>they're all starving.</i>

18:29.834 --> 18:31.751
<i>That was about the
gist of the report.</i>

18:33.250 --> 18:34.521
<i>Get to the colonel, the</i>

18:34.522 --> 18:35.792
<i>colonel hands it to Ferencz,</i>

18:35.834 --> 18:37.209
<i>or to captain to Ferencz.</i>

18:37.250 --> 18:39.584
<i>I get in a Jeep and off I go.</i>

18:45.167 --> 18:46.959
<i>My dad is a guy who has been</i>

18:46.960 --> 18:49.813
<i>traumatized by what he
saw,</i> smelled, heard,

18:49.814 --> 18:50.834
and felt you know

18:50.876 --> 18:52.584
with his own eyes, ears, hands.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.751
<i>I read quite a number</i>

18:55.752 --> 18:58.564
<i>of letters that he
wrote while he was there</i>

18:58.565 --> 18:59.918
<i>liberating the camps.</i>

18:59.959 --> 19:01.918
<i>What he saw, what he felt</i>

19:01.919 --> 19:03.876
<i>while this was going on.</i>

19:03.918 --> 19:05.584
<i>This has fueled a nuclear</i>

19:05.585 --> 19:07.250
<i>reactor inside this man,</i>

19:07.292 --> 19:09.146
<i>and it's still, still, still</i>

19:09.147 --> 19:11.000
<i>what he does every day.</i>

19:14.667 --> 19:16.292
<i>I would first find
the commanding officer</i>

19:16.334 --> 19:18.584
<i>of the tank battalion.</i>

19:18.626 --> 19:20.501
<i>I'd go to him and say I'm here</i>

19:20.502 --> 19:22.375
<i>on orders of General Patton.</i>

19:22.417 --> 19:24.626
<i>War crimes investigator.</i>

19:24.667 --> 19:26.751
<i>I want 10 men
immediately surround</i>

19:26.792 --> 19:28.000
the office,

19:28.042 --> 19:29.962
- nobody goes in or out.
- Without my permission.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.375
<i>And look back on it, you know</i>

19:35.417 --> 19:38.209
<i>I built a screen,
some sort of a screen</i>

19:38.250 --> 19:40.792
<i>before my mind to
say this is not real.</i>

19:40.834 --> 19:43.751
<i>This is you know,
just go ahead you know?</i>

19:47.626 --> 19:49.418
<i>It's incomprehensible to</i>

19:49.419 --> 19:51.209
<i>a rational human mind.</i>

19:53.918 --> 19:56.292
People lying dead on the floor.

19:56.334 --> 19:57.643
You don't know if
they're dead or alive.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.751
The floor is covered
with dead people.

20:01.584 --> 20:02.959
Some of them are moving.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.459
They're pleading with their

20:04.460 --> 20:05.918
eyes, help me, you know?

20:05.959 --> 20:07.688
They're dressed in rags.

20:07.689 --> 20:09.417
They don't... Complete rags.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.959
The SS is fleeing, trying

20:10.960 --> 20:12.459
to run out the other end.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.751
Some inmates who were
alive catching SS men

20:14.792 --> 20:17.000
and beat 'em to death
or burn 'em alive.

20:17.042 --> 20:18.292
I've seen that too.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.876
And the medics
are not yet there.

20:22.918 --> 20:25.834
You know they'll
be coming in soon,

20:25.876 --> 20:29.125
and the crematorium going.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.167
Stacks of bodies, looks like

20:31.168 --> 20:33.167
skeletons, all of 'em bones

20:33.209 --> 20:34.564
piled up like cord wood in

20:34.565 --> 20:35.918
front of the crematorium.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.375
The stench in the air,

20:39.417 --> 20:41.209
the human beings behaving

20:41.210 --> 20:43.000
like rats in the garbage pile

20:43.042 --> 20:45.042
digging,
crawling for a bite to eat.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.542
I can't go on describing it.

21:04.918 --> 21:09.209
It becomes vivid again,
and I was ice cold.

21:09.250 --> 21:12.626
I didn't shed a tear,
I didn't hesitate.

21:12.667 --> 21:16.584
I did my job,
because that was my job

21:16.626 --> 21:19.667
<i>and to get out as
fast as you can.</i>

21:31.792 --> 21:33.813
<i>The war was over, and I joined</i>

21:33.814 --> 21:35.834
<i>the army to help win the war.</i>

21:35.876 --> 21:37.375
<i>We had won.</i>

21:37.417 --> 21:40.209
<i>My primary goal after
that was to get home</i>

21:40.250 --> 21:41.834
<i>as soon as possible, try</i>

21:41.835 --> 21:43.417
<i>to resume a normal life.</i>

21:44.834 --> 21:46.709
<i>Not in the wildest imagination</i>

21:46.751 --> 21:47.897
would I have dreamt that

21:47.898 --> 21:49.042
I would've turned around

21:49.083 --> 21:50.667
and gone back to Germany.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.876
That was the furthest
thing from my mind.

21:52.918 --> 21:54.355
I was with 10 million

21:54.356 --> 21:57.042
other GIs coming home,
<i>looking for a job.</i>

21:58.876 --> 22:01.709
<i>And when the cable
came from the Pentagon</i>

22:01.751 --> 22:02.876
<i>saying "Dear sir," they'd</i>

22:02.877 --> 22:04.000
<i>never called me sir before,</i>

22:04.042 --> 22:06.500
"will you please
come to Washington?"

22:06.542 --> 22:07.584
"We want to talk to you,"

22:07.585 --> 22:10.542
I assumed that was
in connection with

22:08.667 --> 22:10.542
job application

22:10.584 --> 22:13.500
and off I went to Washington,

22:13.542 --> 22:15.876
and then my life took
a different turn.

22:27.584 --> 22:29.918
<i>The end of the second World War,</i>

22:29.959 --> 22:32.459
<i>where Europe, parts of.</i>

22:32.460 --> 22:34.959
<i>Asia, just devastated.</i>

22:36.167 --> 22:39.751
<i>How many millions
of people dead?</i>

22:44.167 --> 22:47.625
<i>And not just deaths, but crimes</i>

22:47.626 --> 22:51.083
<i>committed on unimaginable,</i>

22:51.125 --> 22:54.104
industrial scale by the.

22:54.105 --> 22:57.083
Third Reich in Germany.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.750
<i>The pictures from the</i>

23:04.751 --> 23:07.250
<i>liberated concentration camps</i>

23:09.083 --> 23:11.709
<i>did horrify people.</i>

23:16.834 --> 23:19.167
<i>They were so atrocious
that they couldn't</i>

23:19.168 --> 23:20.209
<i>be left unanswered.</i>

23:20.250 --> 23:21.918
Something had to happen.

23:21.959 --> 23:23.751
You couldn't just
have a settlement

23:23.792 --> 23:25.584
and go back to normal.

23:27.709 --> 23:31.375
<i>The Allied powers
decided that you had to</i>

23:31.417 --> 23:34.250
<i>stigmatize what happened.</i>

23:34.292 --> 23:36.334
<i>That this had to
have consequences.</i>

23:39.334 --> 23:41.709
We know there are some people

23:41.710 --> 23:44.792
who said "Just take
out the Nazi murderers"

23:41.751 --> 23:44.792
and shoot them."

23:44.834 --> 23:46.355
There are others who

23:46.356 --> 23:47.876
said "Just let it alone."

23:47.918 --> 23:49.751
What's past is past."

23:49.792 --> 23:52.959
To its credit,
the US administration

23:53.000 --> 23:55.834
<i>insisted on a trial.</i>

23:57.792 --> 24:00.334
<i>And to see the 22 top.</i>

24:00.335 --> 24:02.876
<i>Nazi leaders still alive</i>

24:05.959 --> 24:10.542
<i>in the dock in that
courtroom in Nuremberg,</i>

24:10.584 --> 24:13.209
I think sent a signal

24:13.250 --> 24:15.709
that these kinds of crimes

24:15.751 --> 24:19.876
could be prosecuted fairly

24:19.918 --> 24:23.876
and those responsible
held to account.

24:29.709 --> 24:31.792
Attention, tribunal.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.768
<i>- Judges from.
- Britain, America, Russia,</i>

24:33.792 --> 24:35.063
<i>And France assemble in.</i>

24:35.064 --> 24:36.334
<i>Nuremberg's courthouse.</i>

24:37.542 --> 24:39.042
<i>Empowered to impose
sentence of death</i>

24:39.083 --> 24:41.751
<i>or such punishment as
it may consider just,</i>

24:41.792 --> 24:43.334
<i>the tribunal sits in judgment</i>

24:43.375 --> 24:45.042
<i>upon 20 leaders
of the Nazi party.</i>

24:46.709 --> 24:49.250
<i>To think of the
situation in summer 1945,</i>

24:49.292 --> 24:52.459
<i>what a lot of German
cities looked like,</i>

24:52.500 --> 24:55.626
it was really challenging
to find a place

24:55.667 --> 24:57.626
where you could
hold such a trial.

24:57.667 --> 24:59.147
You would need the building,

24:59.148 --> 25:00.626
you would need the prison.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.976
<i>- You know just infrastructure,
- you would need an airport,</i>

25:03.000 --> 25:05.417
<i>Something where you
could fly in people</i>

25:05.459 --> 25:07.834
<i>and they ended up
here in Nuremberg</i>

25:07.876 --> 25:09.897
<i>because the palace of</i>

25:09.898 --> 25:11.918
<i>justice had survived the war</i>

25:11.959 --> 25:13.918
<i>more or less undestroyed,</i>

25:13.959 --> 25:15.834
and of course there also

25:15.835 --> 25:17.709
was the symbolic aspect.

25:23.876 --> 25:26.500
<i>Nuremberg was the
place where the Nazis</i>

25:26.542 --> 25:28.876
<i>held their annual party rallies,</i>

25:28.918 --> 25:31.064
<i>so it's more than an</i>

25:31.065 --> 25:33.209
<i>infrastructural question.</i>

25:33.250 --> 25:35.709
<i>The symbolism was
very much in the heads</i>

25:35.751 --> 25:38.126
<i>of those planning the.</i>

25:38.127 --> 25:40.500
<i>Nuremberg Trials in July 1945.</i>

25:41.918 --> 25:43.792
If you go back and
read the transcript

25:43.834 --> 25:45.313
of the original IMT, the.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.792
International Military Tribunal,

25:46.834 --> 25:49.292
<i>the way Robert Jackson
addressed the court,</i>

25:49.334 --> 25:50.813
<i>I mean this is not your</i>

25:50.814 --> 25:52.292
<i>classic opening statement.</i>

25:52.334 --> 25:54.417
This is poetry in motion.

25:56.167 --> 25:58.271
The privilege of opening

25:58.272 --> 26:00.375
the first trial in history

26:01.792 --> 26:04.542
for crimes against
the peace of the world

26:06.375 --> 26:08.542
imposes a grave responsibility.

26:09.792 --> 26:11.813
<i>The wrongs which we seek</i>

26:11.814 --> 26:13.834
<i>to condemn and punish</i>

26:14.834 --> 26:17.293
<i>have been so calculated, so</i>

26:17.294 --> 26:19.751
<i>malignant, and so devastating</i>

26:21.000 --> 26:22.771
<i>that civilization cannot</i>

26:22.772 --> 26:24.542
<i>tolerate their being ignored</i>

26:24.584 --> 26:26.397
<i>because it cannot survive</i>

26:26.398 --> 26:28.209
<i>their being repeated.</i>

26:29.042 --> 26:31.209
I do think that he had a sense

26:31.250 --> 26:34.459
that the world,
when that trial has ended,

26:34.500 --> 26:36.876
would not be the same
in international law.

26:36.918 --> 26:38.876
You know, he had this sentiment

26:38.918 --> 26:40.792
that this is world history,

26:40.834 --> 26:43.375
that he was, that he was part of

26:43.417 --> 26:45.792
or even the driving force of.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.167
<i>That four great nations,</i>

26:49.959 --> 26:53.834
<i>fleshed with victory
and stung with injury,</i>

26:53.876 --> 26:56.126
<i>stay the hand of vengeance</i>

26:56.127 --> 26:58.375
<i>and voluntarily submit</i>

26:58.417 --> 27:00.084
<i>their captive enemies to</i>

27:00.085 --> 27:01.751
<i>the judgment of the law</i>

27:03.209 --> 27:05.709
<i>is one of the most
significant tributes</i>

27:07.042 --> 27:09.834
that power has ever
paid to reason.

27:12.167 --> 27:15.834
The Nuremberg Trials
were the first time

27:15.876 --> 27:18.376
in modern times that we had

27:18.377 --> 27:20.876
defined crimes against humanity,

27:21.834 --> 27:23.772
genocide, war crimes,

27:23.773 --> 27:25.709
in such an explicit way

27:25.751 --> 27:27.793
and then held men accountable

27:27.794 --> 27:29.834
for violating them.

27:29.876 --> 27:31.626
I was interviewed by

27:31.627 --> 27:33.375
a colonel Mickey Marcus

27:33.417 --> 27:37.105
<i>who was in the Pentagon,
and his job was to</i>

27:37.106 --> 27:40.835
<i>try to recruit
staff for subsequent</i>

27:40.836 --> 27:42.751
<i>proceedings after the.</i>

27:42.792 --> 27:45.000
<i>International Military
Trial was finished.</i>

27:46.542 --> 27:48.709
<i>And he said there's somebody</i>

27:48.710 --> 27:51.209
<i>else wants to talk to
you and that was then</i>

27:51.210 --> 27:53.667
<i>colonel Telford Taylor.</i>

27:54.792 --> 27:56.396
<i>Telford Taylor had been</i>

27:56.397 --> 27:58.000
<i>assigned by president Truman</i>

27:58.042 --> 28:00.167
<i>to carry on the work of Jackson</i>

28:00.209 --> 28:01.834
<i>by being the chief of counsel</i>

28:01.835 --> 28:03.459
<i>for the 12 subsequent trials</i>

28:03.500 --> 28:04.959
<i>were being planned.</i>

28:05.000 --> 28:08.792
<i>"So he said" I'm
considering you know</i>

28:08.834 --> 28:10.417
<i>you going back with me," he said</i>

28:10.459 --> 28:12.480
<i>"but I have checked your army"</i>

28:12.481 --> 28:14.500
<i>record and your background</i>

28:14.542 --> 28:16.438
<i>and I understand that you're</i>

28:16.439 --> 28:18.334
<i>"occasionally insubordinate'"</i>

28:18.375 --> 28:20.125
and I said "That's not
correct, sir."

28:20.167 --> 28:22.292
I'm usually insubordinate.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.105
I do not obey any orders that

28:24.106 --> 28:26.980
I know are stupid or
illegal, but I've been

28:26.981 --> 28:28.042
"checking up on you too,"

28:28.083 --> 28:29.709
and I had in the interim,

28:29.751 --> 28:31.727
- "and I don't think you'll.
- Give me that kind of order."

28:31.751 --> 28:33.584
He was also a Harvard graduate,

28:33.626 --> 28:35.542
and he'd checked my record.

28:35.584 --> 28:36.709
So he smiled and he said.

28:36.710 --> 28:37.834
"You'll go with me."

28:42.918 --> 28:45.751
<i>These were to be 12
additional trials</i>

28:45.792 --> 28:47.813
<i>because it was recognized</i>

28:47.814 --> 28:49.834
<i>by just taking a snapshot</i>

28:49.876 --> 28:52.001
<i>of the International Military.</i>

28:52.002 --> 28:54.938
<i>Tribunal top Nazi
leaders, you still didn't</i>

28:54.939 --> 28:56.959
<i>quite understand how
it would be possible</i>

28:57.000 --> 28:59.792
<i>for a civilized
country like Germany</i>

28:59.834 --> 29:01.792
<i>to engage in the
type of atrocities</i>

29:01.834 --> 29:03.751
<i>for which they were responsible.</i>

29:03.792 --> 29:04.792
And the idea of these

29:04.793 --> 29:05.793
subsequent proceedings,

29:05.834 --> 29:07.584
as they were called, was to

29:07.585 --> 29:09.334
put the doctors on trial,

29:09.375 --> 29:11.042
<i>a sampling who performed</i>

29:11.043 --> 29:12.709
<i>medical experiments</i>

29:12.751 --> 29:14.834
<i>on concentration camp inmates.</i>

29:14.876 --> 29:16.001
<i>The lawyers and judges</i>

29:16.002 --> 29:17.125
<i>who perverted the law</i>

29:17.167 --> 29:18.813
<i>which was the framework on</i>

29:18.814 --> 29:20.459
<i>which they built the film.</i>

29:20.500 --> 29:22.125
Judgment at Nuremberg.

29:22.167 --> 29:26.209
You had the industrialists
like IG Farben

29:26.250 --> 29:29.042
<i>who provided the money
to build Auschwitz,</i>

29:29.083 --> 29:30.813
<i>and who were working people</i>

29:30.814 --> 29:32.542
<i>to death for their own profit</i>

29:32.584 --> 29:33.792
<i>in their own companies.</i>

29:33.834 --> 29:36.250
<i>Give them a chance
to state their case.</i>

29:36.292 --> 29:37.959
<i>The foreign ministry people,</i>

29:37.960 --> 29:39.626
<i>and then the SS squads</i>

29:39.667 --> 29:40.772
<i>who were the real, the</i>

29:40.773 --> 29:41.876
<i>murderers on the scene.</i>

29:41.918 --> 29:43.959
<i>So the idea was
to take a sampling</i>

29:44.000 --> 29:45.730
for these 12 different

29:45.731 --> 29:47.459
categories and project that

29:47.500 --> 29:49.918
and through the form
of these 12 trials

29:49.959 --> 29:51.709
to give a comprehensive picture,

29:51.751 --> 29:53.417
<i>and Telford Taylor was to be</i>

29:53.418 --> 29:55.083
<i>chief of counsel for those 12.</i>

29:57.042 --> 29:59.417
<i>I can imagine no two
more different people</i>

29:59.459 --> 30:01.792
<i>than Telford Taylor and Ben.</i>

30:01.834 --> 30:04.459
Telford, this very tall,

30:04.460 --> 30:07.083
elegant, WASPy gentlemen

30:08.167 --> 30:10.334
<i>who could not have been</i>

30:10.335 --> 30:12.500
<i>more polite and thoughtful,</i>

30:12.542 --> 30:13.647
you never got a quick

30:13.648 --> 30:14.751
answer out of Telford.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.584
It was always let
me think about that.

30:17.626 --> 30:20.001
<i>And then this kind of dynamo</i>

30:20.002 --> 30:22.375
<i>of a tiny little Jewish guy</i>

30:23.918 --> 30:25.855
<i>with none of the kind</i>

30:25.856 --> 30:27.792
<i>of elegance of Telford.</i>

30:27.834 --> 30:29.101
He had the same
elegance of mind,

30:29.125 --> 30:32.626
<i>but not elegance of
physical appearance.</i>

30:32.667 --> 30:35.083
<i>I can easily see the attraction.</i>

30:36.250 --> 30:39.792
<i>He was brilliant,
insightful, determined.</i>

30:39.834 --> 30:41.313
<i>He had all the qualities</i>

30:41.314 --> 30:42.792
<i>that one would look for</i>

30:42.834 --> 30:44.250
<i>if one were Telford Taylor.</i>

30:48.792 --> 30:51.709
<i>By the time we got
there to that stage,</i>

30:51.751 --> 30:53.314
he had already picked lawyers

30:53.315 --> 30:54.876
for most of his trials,

30:54.918 --> 30:56.397
and he said "Ben look, you have"

30:56.398 --> 30:57.876
the experience in the field

30:57.918 --> 30:59.250
of going into the camps,

30:59.292 --> 31:02.834
collecting evidence
for the army trials.

31:02.876 --> 31:05.167
We have a number of suspects,

31:05.209 --> 31:06.605
but if you have a suspect and

31:06.606 --> 31:08.000
no evidence you have nothing.

31:08.042 --> 31:11.250
"Your job is to go
find the evidence."

31:11.292 --> 31:13.417
So I took a staff
of about 50 people

31:13.459 --> 31:16.375
and went to Berlin,
set up the organization

31:16.417 --> 31:17.751
<i>to start searching
in the archives</i>

31:17.792 --> 31:19.626
<i>of the Foreign Ministry,</i>

31:19.667 --> 31:21.896
<i>the SS, the Gestapo, the</i>

31:21.897 --> 31:24.125
<i>army, and the industrialists</i>

31:24.167 --> 31:27.709
<i>to see what evidence
we had that they had</i>

31:27.710 --> 31:29.167
<i>committed war crimes.</i>

31:29.209 --> 31:31.438
It was in that capacity that

31:31.439 --> 31:33.667
one of my staff members,

31:33.709 --> 31:35.188
a boy from Switzerland came

31:35.189 --> 31:36.667
and he said look what I found

31:36.709 --> 31:38.959
in the offices of
the Foreign Ministry,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.375
and it was a complete dossier,

31:41.417 --> 31:44.292
<i>the daily reports
coming in from the front</i>

31:44.334 --> 31:45.813
<i>saying how many Jews</i>

31:45.814 --> 31:47.292
<i>these units had murdered.</i>

31:47.334 --> 31:50.083
<i>Now these units were
called Einsatzgruppe,</i>

31:50.125 --> 31:52.292
<i>and it was
deliberately disguised</i>

31:52.334 --> 31:55.584
<i>so you couldn't tell from</i>

31:55.585 --> 31:58.334
<i>the name what it
was, because their</i>

31:58.335 --> 32:01.626
<i>assignment was to go
in</i> behind the German

31:58.375 --> 32:01.626
lines and then murder,

32:01.667 --> 32:03.167
they never used the word murder,

32:03.209 --> 32:05.292
they said eliminate,
exterminate,

32:05.334 --> 32:06.792
<i>every single Jewish man, woman,</i>

32:06.793 --> 32:08.250
<i>and child they could lay</i>

32:08.292 --> 32:10.292
their hands on and do the same

32:10.293 --> 32:12.188
thing for the Gypsies
and do the same thing

32:12.189 --> 32:14.042
for any suspected

32:14.083 --> 32:15.876
possible enemies of the Reich.

32:15.918 --> 32:17.876
<i>That was their job.</i>

32:17.918 --> 32:19.335
<i>They had these daily</i>

32:19.336 --> 32:20.751
<i>reports sent back to Berlin</i>

32:20.792 --> 32:22.584
<i>where they were consolidated</i>

32:22.585 --> 32:24.375
<i>and put together in a folder</i>

32:24.417 --> 32:25.668
and then each of those

32:25.669 --> 32:26.918
reports was sent down

32:26.959 --> 32:28.792
and I had the distribution list,

32:28.834 --> 32:30.501
to 99 different branches

32:30.502 --> 32:32.167
of the German government.

32:32.209 --> 32:33.834
To people like the army who said

32:33.876 --> 32:35.250
I never heard
anything about that

32:35.292 --> 32:37.375
down in my area and so on.

32:37.417 --> 32:38.876
That was baloney, they are

32:38.877 --> 32:40.334
under my distribution list

32:40.375 --> 32:41.938
so I took an adding machine

32:41.939 --> 32:43.500
and began to add them up

32:43.542 --> 32:45.230
and when I reached a

32:45.231 --> 32:46.918
million people murdered,

32:46.959 --> 32:48.417
I said that's enough.

32:48.459 --> 32:50.105
I took a sampling, took

32:50.106 --> 32:52.855
the next plane from
Berlin where I had the

32:52.856 --> 32:53.918
headquarters for that,

32:53.959 --> 32:55.167
went down to Nuremberg

32:55.168 --> 32:56.375
and I said "General,"

32:56.417 --> 32:58.375
by that time he
had been promoted,

32:58.417 --> 33:00.959
"we got to put on a new trial."

33:04.626 --> 33:08.459
<i>The Einsatzgruppe
were task forces</i>

33:08.500 --> 33:10.125
<i>moving behind the front lines</i>

33:10.167 --> 33:13.792
<i>and their only
purpose was to kill.</i>

33:13.834 --> 33:17.751
<i>Jews, minorities,
and opposition.</i>

33:17.792 --> 33:21.709
So they were really
like killing squads.

33:21.751 --> 33:25.918
These were the forces
that rode around

33:25.959 --> 33:29.584
and machine gunned

33:29.626 --> 33:34.667
<i>whole villages and communities</i>

33:34.709 --> 33:39.667
<i>lined up on the
edge of mass graves.</i>

33:45.792 --> 33:48.292
<i>This was not the industrial</i>

33:48.293 --> 33:50.792
<i>horror of Auschwitz.</i>

33:53.709 --> 33:56.499
<i>This was a direct</i>
human being to human

33:56.500 --> 34:01.459
being atrocity.

34:05.375 --> 34:09.876
<i>It concentrated in
a very direct way</i>

34:09.918 --> 34:12.751
<i>the ability of one human being</i>

34:12.792 --> 34:17.083
<i>to savagely destroy another</i>

34:17.125 --> 34:20.500
<i>in a way that is just
incomprehensible.</i>

34:28.417 --> 34:30.833
He said "I'm sorry,
we can't do it."

34:30.876 --> 34:32.938
All the 12 trials have been

34:32.938 --> 34:35.000
approved by the Pentagon.

34:35.042 --> 34:36.958
We have, the staff has

34:36.960 --> 34:38.876
already been assigned.

34:38.918 --> 34:40.313
We don't have staff, we

34:40.315 --> 34:41.708
probably can't get approval

34:41.751 --> 34:43.125
for any more crimes anyway.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.375
The Pentagon had already cooled

34:45.417 --> 34:48.375
"on the trials,
so we can't do it."

34:48.417 --> 34:51.417
"Ah," I said,
"you can't let these guys go.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.043
I have in my hand mass murder

34:53.043 --> 34:54.626
on an incredible scale.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.083
The evidence is all here.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.667
"You're not gonna let
these guys walk away."

34:58.709 --> 35:01.059
- He said, "Well can you do it in.
- Addition to your other work?"

35:01.083 --> 35:02.792
And I said, "Sure!"

35:02.834 --> 35:04.751
And he said "Okay,
so you do it."

35:04.792 --> 35:06.792
Okay, and so it happened that

35:06.793 --> 35:08.792
I became the chief prosecutor

35:08.834 --> 35:11.647
of what turned out to
be the biggest murder

35:11.648 --> 35:12.709
trial in human history.

35:12.751 --> 35:16.876
I have to say looking
back on myself at 27,

35:16.918 --> 35:19.268
- I don't know about you, I.
- Can't think of very many people.

35:19.292 --> 35:23.626
Who would've had the
confidence, the skill,

35:23.667 --> 35:28.667
and the knowledge in
a new legal territory

35:29.792 --> 35:32.876
to be so persuasive
in that role.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.751
<i>First of all, you only pick</i>

35:41.752 --> 35:43.626
<i>a guy who's in captivity.</i>

35:43.667 --> 35:45.272
<i>You don't name Adolf Hitler</i>

35:45.273 --> 35:46.876
<i>'cause you know he's dead,</i>

35:46.918 --> 35:48.918
<i>and there's no sense
putting him in.</i>

35:48.959 --> 35:51.001
<i>So I first said is he dead</i>

35:51.002 --> 35:53.042
<i>or alive, and do we have him?</i>

35:53.083 --> 35:54.959
<i>If we haven't got him, you know.</i>

35:55.000 --> 35:57.167
<i>Mengele and people like
that, forget it.</i>

35:57.209 --> 35:58.209
<i>They may be the top,</i>

35:58.210 --> 35:59.210
<i>but we haven't got 'em.</i>

35:59.250 --> 36:01.500
<i>So you have to know
he's in captivity.</i>

36:06.500 --> 36:08.563
<i>Now, and what evidence</i>

36:08.564 --> 36:10.626
<i>do we have against him?</i>

36:10.667 --> 36:11.727
<i>The Einsatzgruppe was easy.</i>

36:11.751 --> 36:13.125
<i>I had their daily reports.</i>

36:15.250 --> 36:16.792
<i>I had the roster of all the</i>

36:16.793 --> 36:18.334
<i>members of the Einsatzgruppe.</i>

36:18.375 --> 36:20.059
<i>- So I just went through.
- Them and picked me out.</i>

36:20.083 --> 36:22.042
The highest ranking ones,

36:22.083 --> 36:25.209
and so they had about
five or six generals.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.918
I had no enlisted
men in my dock.

36:26.959 --> 36:28.188
Having been an enlisted man

36:28.189 --> 36:29.417
in the United States Army

36:29.459 --> 36:30.959
maybe I was biased.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.167
No enlisted men in my dock.

36:33.209 --> 36:34.480
Give me the highest rank

36:34.481 --> 36:35.751
and the best educated.

36:35.792 --> 36:38.042
<i>Those are the two criteria.</i>

36:40.667 --> 36:43.292
<i>Many of them with
doctor degrees,</i>

36:43.334 --> 36:45.834
<i>doctor,
Dr. Rasch had a double doctorate</i>

36:45.876 --> 36:47.918
<i>and I never had
heard that before.</i>

36:47.959 --> 36:49.042
<i>I was surprised at doctor</i>

36:49.043 --> 36:50.125
<i>doctor, two doctorates.</i>

36:50.167 --> 36:54.209
He killed 33,721
Jews in two days.

36:54.250 --> 36:56.375
29, 30 September, 1941.

36:59.959 --> 37:01.167
I got the bastard.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.876
<i>I was the first
one in the courtroom.</i>

37:16.834 --> 37:18.105
<i>I went in, I sat down,</i>

37:18.106 --> 37:19.375
<i>there was nobody but me.</i>

37:23.792 --> 37:26.042
<i>I was thinking over my statement</i>

37:26.083 --> 37:28.751
<i>which I had written
the day before.</i>

37:28.792 --> 37:30.792
<i>I was seeing if I
could improve it,</i>

37:30.834 --> 37:32.667
<i>and I was waiting for
the trial to begin.</i>

37:36.667 --> 37:37.792
<i>I was calm.</i>

37:38.959 --> 37:40.751
<i>I was determined.</i>

37:42.834 --> 37:45.042
<i>I didn't realize I
would be making history.</i>

37:53.918 --> 37:57.626
We are now ready to
hear the presentation

37:57.627 --> 37:58.792
by the prosecution.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.542
<i>I made the opening statement,</i>

38:00.543 --> 38:02.250
<i>which stated the case.</i>

38:02.292 --> 38:04.250
<i>It did not appear on the film,</i>

38:04.292 --> 38:06.459
because the film
didn't start rolling

38:06.500 --> 38:07.688
until after the first

38:07.689 --> 38:08.876
paragraph had been done,

38:08.918 --> 38:10.251
and what it left out was

38:10.252 --> 38:11.584
the important beginning.

38:11.626 --> 38:13.626
It was,
"May it please your honors,"

38:13.667 --> 38:15.876
it is with sorrow and with hope

38:15.918 --> 38:18.250
that we here disclose
the massive murder

38:18.292 --> 38:20.167
"of a million people et cetera."

38:21.792 --> 38:23.667
This was the tragic fulfillment

38:25.042 --> 38:28.751
of a program of
intolerance and arrogance.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.292
<i>But I was very specific.</i>

38:30.334 --> 38:32.459
Vengeance is not our goal.

38:33.667 --> 38:37.167
Nor do we seek merely
a just retribution.

38:38.334 --> 38:40.626
We ask this court to affirm

38:40.627 --> 38:42.918
by international penal action

38:44.834 --> 38:48.125
man's right to live
in peace and dignity

38:49.167 --> 38:51.334
regardless of his race or creed.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.000
The case we present is a

38:56.001 --> 38:58.500
plea of humanity to law.

39:00.167 --> 39:02.709
<i>So here at 27,
I don't know about you,</i>

39:02.751 --> 39:05.334
27 is just the beginning
of being a grownup

39:05.375 --> 39:07.876
and he was in
front of the world.

39:07.918 --> 39:09.501
He wasn't just in front of these

39:09.502 --> 39:11.083
judges and these defendants.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.834
He was in front of the world

39:12.876 --> 39:14.751
making a case as a prosecutor.

39:14.792 --> 39:16.918
Looking at the judges and saying

39:16.959 --> 39:19.334
the case we present is a

39:19.335 --> 39:22.709
plea of humanity to
law, beautiful stuff.

39:22.751 --> 39:25.584
Honestly, it was years for me

39:25.626 --> 39:27.022
before I wouldn't get literally

39:27.023 --> 39:28.417
teary eyed and emotional

39:28.459 --> 39:29.918
just saying those words

39:29.919 --> 39:32.876
because I think
they're so powerful, so

39:29.959 --> 39:32.876
beautiful, so applicable,

39:32.918 --> 39:34.375
so apropos to what's
happening today.

39:34.417 --> 39:37.126
We shall show that these

39:37.127 --> 39:39.834
deeds of men in uniform

39:39.876 --> 39:42.355
for the methodical execution

39:42.356 --> 39:44.834
of long range plans

39:44.876 --> 39:47.584
to destroy ethnic, national,

39:47.585 --> 39:50.292
political, and religious groups

39:51.542 --> 39:54.250
which stood condemned
in the Nazi mind.

39:55.876 --> 39:59.876
<i>Here's Ben standing
on some books</i>

39:59.918 --> 40:03.834
<i>so that he can be
taller than the lectern</i>

40:03.876 --> 40:07.042
that is immediately
in front of him.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.729
I can only imagine what

40:08.730 --> 40:10.375
he must have felt like here.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.792
This little Jewish guy who,

40:11.793 --> 40:13.167
had his parents not left,

40:13.209 --> 40:14.584
would've been one of

40:14.585 --> 40:15.959
those gassed and killed,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.334
standing and looking at

40:18.335 --> 40:22.168
these German supermen
<i>and saying "I have</i>"

40:22.169 --> 40:25.125
<i>more power now,
but I'm just a kid."</i>

40:25.167 --> 40:27.417
<i>It must have been
such a mixed feeling</i>

40:27.459 --> 40:29.855
of passion and determination,

40:29.856 --> 40:32.250
"I have to do this,"

40:32.292 --> 40:35.250
and nervousness
and a combination

40:35.292 --> 40:37.292
<i>of self-confidence
and self-doubt.</i>

40:39.500 --> 40:41.751
<i>I wasn't nervous at all.</i>

40:41.792 --> 40:42.959
<i>I didn't kill anybody.</i>

40:43.000 --> 40:44.667
<i>They were the ones
who were nervous,</i>

40:44.709 --> 40:46.126
<i>and they should have been</i>

40:46.127 --> 40:47.542
<i>'cause I had the evidence.</i>

40:48.918 --> 40:50.209
You know this was really

40:50.210 --> 40:51.500
every prosecutor's dream.

40:51.542 --> 40:52.768
You don't have to
call a witness.

40:52.792 --> 40:55.292
All you have to do is
enter the documents,

40:55.334 --> 40:57.063
primary documents saying when,

40:57.064 --> 40:58.792
where, who did the killing.

41:00.543 --> 41:02.250
<i>Because you had enough written</i>

41:02.251 --> 41:04.792
<i>documentary material
that you could point</i>

41:02.292 --> 41:04.792
<i>at saying, "Yeah."</i>

41:04.834 --> 41:07.209
Here you say,
"Is this your signature?"

41:07.250 --> 41:09.125
And that's it.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.938
You didn't need to have any

41:10.939 --> 41:12.709
more proof by witnesses.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.792
And of course the Germans

41:15.793 --> 41:18.792
were cautious enough
to put everything into

41:15.834 --> 41:18.792
the books that they did.

41:20.584 --> 41:23.292
And offered as
prosecution exhibit 29,

41:26.834 --> 41:28.751
I see there's another
objection coming.

41:28.792 --> 41:29.792
I'll continue the quote.

41:38.209 --> 41:39.792
<i>The defense lawyers</i>

41:39.793 --> 41:41.375
<i>who were generally German</i>

41:41.417 --> 41:43.230
were actually a highly

41:43.231 --> 41:45.042
talented group of lawyers,

41:45.083 --> 41:47.125
and they bore themselves

41:47.126 --> 41:49.167
quite well in the courtroom

41:49.209 --> 41:51.751
and they sometimes
were able to challenge

41:51.792 --> 41:54.542
the prosecution
quite effectively.

41:54.584 --> 41:57.792
They were very much
individualists,

41:57.834 --> 41:59.917
and they didn't come up with

41:59.918 --> 42:02.000
a sort of common strategy.

42:02.042 --> 42:03.792
They all had their
own strategies.

42:03.834 --> 42:08.292
<i>They were paid by the tribunal,</i>

42:08.334 --> 42:10.709
<i>and for the times then</i>

42:10.751 --> 42:12.584
<i>it was a considerable
amount of money.</i>

42:12.626 --> 42:14.376
You know, in 1945 Germany

42:14.377 --> 42:16.125
was totally destructed

42:16.167 --> 42:17.751
and for a lawyer I think it

42:17.752 --> 42:19.334
was quite a good thing to,

42:19.375 --> 42:21.105
to work at the tribunal because

42:21.106 --> 42:24.083
you were given money
on a regular basis.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.522
It should be recognized

42:26.523 --> 42:30.855
that in 1945 and '46,
the German people

42:30.856 --> 42:34.272
were not necessarily
<i>seeking to tarnish</i>

42:34.273 --> 42:37.876
<i>the reputation of
their surviving</i>

42:37.877 --> 42:39.959
<i>leaders at that time.</i>

42:40.000 --> 42:41.834
<i>There was a lot of
opposition to Nuremberg</i>

42:41.876 --> 42:44.083
<i>by the German
people, and so when</i>

42:44.125 --> 42:46.292
<i>they saw their leaders
up on the stand</i>

42:46.334 --> 42:49.250
<i>this was an assault
on German honor.</i>

42:49.292 --> 42:52.709
And so you know the
defense lawyers knew

42:52.751 --> 42:54.793
that they sort of had the

42:54.794 --> 42:56.834
German people behind them

42:56.876 --> 42:59.230
in representing the Nazi

42:59.231 --> 43:01.584
defendants on the stand.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Have you read the indictment?

43:05.042 --> 43:06.250
Yeah.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.209
How do you plead
to this indictment?

43:08.250 --> 43:09.667
Guilty or not guilty?

43:13.834 --> 43:15.751
"Not guilty in the
sense of the indictment"

43:15.792 --> 43:18.709
is what they said,
but what did that mean?

43:18.751 --> 43:19.935
The judge said correctly,
"We'll take that

43:19.959 --> 43:21.584
as a plea of not guilty."

43:21.626 --> 43:24.876
I think the defendants
honestly believed

43:24.918 --> 43:27.083
they were not guilty.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.709
They had persuaded themselves

43:29.710 --> 43:32.292
that they did the right thing.

43:32.334 --> 43:35.876
<i>These were people who were</i>

43:35.918 --> 43:38.064
<i>not necessarily born to</i>

43:38.065 --> 43:40.209
<i>become mass murderers.</i>

43:40.250 --> 43:43.626
<i>They were susceptible
to the pressures</i>

43:43.667 --> 43:45.688
<i>that made them mass</i>

43:45.689 --> 43:47.709
<i>murderers in the Nazi regime.</i>

43:47.751 --> 43:48.876
That doesn't mean that

43:48.877 --> 43:50.000
I could ever do that.

43:50.042 --> 43:51.268
I could never do that, no matter

43:51.292 --> 43:52.918
what the circumstances were.

43:52.959 --> 43:54.855
There are certain people who

43:54.856 --> 43:56.751
could never, ever become Nazis

43:56.792 --> 43:57.938
and there are others who

43:57.939 --> 43:59.083
could've gone either way

43:59.125 --> 44:00.376
and I think many of the

44:00.377 --> 44:01.626
defendants at Nuremberg

44:01.667 --> 44:04.626
could have gone either way.

44:18.334 --> 44:23.083
<i>Dr. Otto Ohlendorf,
General of the SS.</i>

44:23.125 --> 44:24.709
<i>I knew him quite well.</i>

44:24.751 --> 44:27.876
Now, would I call him an animal?

44:27.918 --> 44:29.876
He was rational.

44:29.918 --> 44:32.709
He was I'm sure good
to his cats and dogs.

44:32.751 --> 44:34.167
He was the father
of five children.

44:34.209 --> 44:36.918
<i>He made a sensible argument.</i>

44:36.959 --> 44:40.626
<i>He was reasonably
honest in his answers.</i>

44:40.667 --> 44:42.792
<i>He said he would do it again,</i>

44:42.834 --> 44:44.293
<i>even if they ordered him</i>

44:44.294 --> 44:45.751
<i>to kill his own sister</i>

44:45.792 --> 44:47.834
<i>and the reason was Hitler</i>

44:47.835 --> 44:51.314
<i>knew that the Germans
were going to be</i>

44:51.315 --> 44:52.709
<i>attacked by the Russians</i>

44:52.751 --> 44:54.918
<i>and Hitler had more
knowledge than he did,</i>

44:54.959 --> 44:56.355
<i>therefore he was in no</i>

44:56.356 --> 44:57.751
<i>position to challenge that.</i>

44:57.792 --> 45:01.000
<i>And it was lawful,
therefore to act</i>

45:01.042 --> 45:03.397
in anticipatory self-defense

45:03.398 --> 45:05.751
to prevent that from happening

45:05.792 --> 45:07.334
and that's what he was doing.

45:07.375 --> 45:09.542
<i>He made an argument which the.</i>

45:09.543 --> 45:11.709
<i>Pentagon would make today.</i>

45:13.000 --> 45:15.209
<i>Self-defense was his plea.</i>

45:17.167 --> 45:19.043
Very well, we'll leave

45:19.044 --> 45:20.918
this after one more question.

45:20.959 --> 45:23.126
The figure of 90,000 is the

45:23.127 --> 45:25.292
best estimate you can give

45:27.959 --> 45:28.959
at this moment.

45:29.918 --> 45:32.375
I take it we must
continue to read that

45:32.417 --> 45:34.771
with the qualification which

45:34.772 --> 45:37.125
you gave in direct testimony

45:37.167 --> 45:39.417
that you think there's a great

45:39.418 --> 45:41.667
deal of exaggeration in it.

45:42.876 --> 45:44.959
<i>He made the point,
some of the commanders</i>

45:45.000 --> 45:46.813
would take the infants

45:46.814 --> 45:49.709
and just hold 'em by
a leg and smash their

45:49.710 --> 45:51.855
head against a tree
and he said I didn't

45:51.856 --> 45:52.918
believe in that.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.834
He said, "I told my men"

45:54.835 --> 45:56.709
when a mother has an infant

45:56.751 --> 45:58.751
and of course the
infant is crying

45:58.792 --> 46:00.250
and the mother is crying

46:00.292 --> 46:03.584
and she's holding the
infant to her breast,

46:03.626 --> 46:05.126
aim for the infant because

46:05.127 --> 46:06.626
you'll kill both of them

46:06.667 --> 46:08.709
with one shot,
you'll quiet the mother,

46:08.751 --> 46:10.272
<i>you'll save ammunition</i>

46:10.273 --> 46:11.792
<i>"and it's much more humane."</i>

46:13.751 --> 46:14.709
<i>"And there were other things."</i>

46:14.751 --> 46:16.792
<i>For example, we had gas vans.</i>

46:16.834 --> 46:18.272
<i>They were ordinary, you</i>

46:18.273 --> 46:19.709
<i>know, like trailers here</i>

46:19.751 --> 46:21.647
<i>except that they attached</i>

46:21.648 --> 46:23.542
<i>the hose from the engine</i>

46:23.584 --> 46:25.876
<i>to the inside so the fumes would</i>

46:25.918 --> 46:28.918
<i>asphyxiate the people
inside the van,</i>

46:28.959 --> 46:31.000
<i>and they'd pack 'em in
solid, lock 'em in,</i>

46:31.042 --> 46:32.918
<i>and about 20 minutes
they get to the place</i>

46:32.959 --> 46:34.042
<i>where they're going to</i>

46:34.043 --> 46:36.459
<i>dump 'em,
open the van and dump 'em all</i>

46:35.167 --> 46:36.459
<i>"into the ditch."</i>

46:36.500 --> 46:37.875
But Ohlendorf said,

46:37.876 --> 46:40.688
"I didn't like the gas
vans because some of"

46:40.689 --> 46:43.959
them were not dead,
and then you had to

46:42.125 --> 46:43.959
sort 'em out by hand

46:44.000 --> 46:45.438
and they were screaming

46:45.439 --> 46:48.314
"and they were bloody
and they were messy,"

46:48.315 --> 46:49.709
and he said, "it was bad"

46:49.751 --> 46:50.959
for the morale of the

46:50.960 --> 46:52.167
men to have to do that.

46:52.209 --> 46:53.751
So I told 'em I didn't want

46:53.752 --> 46:55.292
"any more of the gas vans."

46:55.334 --> 46:57.043
So Ohlendorf was really

46:57.044 --> 46:58.791
quite a decent
chap, you might say,

46:58.792 --> 47:00.334
aside from the fact

47:00.375 --> 47:02.166
that he killed 90,000
Jews, I'm sure he was

47:02.167 --> 47:03.918
quite a gentleman.

47:15.250 --> 47:17.042
<i>These million
people were murdered</i>

47:17.083 --> 47:18.792
<i>because they didn't share</i>

47:18.793 --> 47:21.959
<i>the race, the religion,
or the ideology of</i>

47:21.960 --> 47:24.876
<i>"their executioners,
and I said, "That's</i>

47:24.877 --> 47:27.500
<i>a terrible crime
and it's a crime</i>

47:24.918 --> 47:27.500
<i>"against humanity."</i>

47:27.542 --> 47:29.834
<i>And I called it a
crime against humanity.</i>

47:32.918 --> 47:34.022
<i>"And I said," If we can</i>

47:34.023 --> 47:37.792
<i>prevent that in future
by condemning crimes</i>

47:37.793 --> 47:40.792
<i>against humanity,
we will reassert the</i>

47:40.793 --> 47:42.876
<i>"legal right of all
people to be protected."</i>

47:46.250 --> 47:48.334
<i>If we could establish
a principle rule</i>

47:48.375 --> 47:51.626
<i>which would protect
humanity in the future,</i>

47:51.667 --> 47:54.083
<i>then this trial
would be significant.</i>

47:59.918 --> 48:01.459
For the first time, the

48:01.460 --> 48:03.000
international community

48:03.042 --> 48:07.542
tried to put law as an answer

48:07.584 --> 48:09.959
to these most horrible crimes

48:10.000 --> 48:12.834
<i>that originated
from Nazi Germany.</i>

48:12.876 --> 48:14.751
<i>And this was a revolution.</i>

48:14.792 --> 48:17.250
<i>It started the
way we think about</i>

48:17.292 --> 48:19.250
international criminal law.

48:19.292 --> 48:21.042
About international
law generally.

48:23.209 --> 48:27.375
<i>I had a list I made
myself on a yellow page</i>

48:27.417 --> 48:28.876
<i>in which I listed
all the defendants</i>

48:28.918 --> 48:30.501
<i>and I listed what I thought</i>

48:30.502 --> 48:32.083
<i>the sentence should be.</i>

48:33.250 --> 48:36.042
The actual sentences
were more severe

48:36.083 --> 48:37.751
than what I would have listed.

48:40.584 --> 48:41.584
<i>I was numb.</i>

48:43.000 --> 48:44.563
<i>They're all imprisoned</i>

48:44.564 --> 48:46.125
<i>below the courthouse.</i>

48:46.167 --> 48:48.500
<i>There is a lift,
Black Maria they called</i>

48:48.542 --> 48:49.792
<i>which keeps going around</i>

48:49.793 --> 48:51.042
<i>into the courthouse</i>

48:51.083 --> 48:53.292
<i>and a sliding door which opens.</i>

48:53.334 --> 48:56.125
<i>As each defendant came up,</i>

48:56.167 --> 48:58.792
<i>they would hear the judge,</i>

48:58.834 --> 49:01.042
<i>"For the crimes of
which you are convicted,"</i>

49:01.083 --> 49:02.625
<i>this tribunal sentenced</i>

49:02.626 --> 49:04.167
<i>"you to death by hanging."</i>

49:05.626 --> 49:08.834
Put the earphones
back, take it off.

49:08.876 --> 49:10.918
Bow, step back a
step into the lift,

49:10.959 --> 49:12.667
the door closes, and he

49:12.668 --> 49:14.375
drops down into hell.

49:14.417 --> 49:15.792
That's what I saw.

49:17.125 --> 49:18.376
One after the other,

49:18.377 --> 49:19.626
for the crimes of which

49:19.667 --> 49:21.626
you are convicted, this tribunal

49:21.667 --> 49:22.855
sentences you death by

49:22.856 --> 49:24.042
hanging, death by hanging,

49:24.083 --> 49:25.500
death by hanging.

49:25.542 --> 49:27.292
I thought my head
was gonna bust.

49:28.918 --> 49:31.626
<i>It was customary for
the chief prosecutor</i>

49:31.667 --> 49:33.230
<i>to invite his staff for a party</i>

49:33.231 --> 49:34.792
<i>when every trial was ended.</i>

49:34.834 --> 49:36.500
<i>I had a party
arranged for my house.</i>

49:36.542 --> 49:38.375
<i>I couldn't go to my own party.</i>

49:38.417 --> 49:40.167
<i>I went home, went to bed.</i>

49:40.209 --> 49:42.792
<i>My head was pounding with it.</i>

49:44.042 --> 49:45.876
<i>So how do you describe</i>

49:45.877 --> 49:47.709
<i>that emotion, that feeling?</i>

49:47.751 --> 49:49.626
<i>I didn't say I'm sorry for them.</i>

49:49.667 --> 49:50.959
<i>I didn't say hooray for me.</i>

49:52.542 --> 49:55.063
<i>It was a very tense, very</i>

49:55.064 --> 49:57.584
<i>severe emotional reaction</i>

49:58.667 --> 50:00.948
<i>- knowing that you're responsible.
- For killing this guy.</i>

50:02.792 --> 50:05.918
<i>Otto Ohlendorf,
he was the only defendant</i>

50:05.959 --> 50:10.709
<i>that I ever talked to man to man</i>

50:10.751 --> 50:12.542
<i>after he was sentenced to death.</i>

50:13.792 --> 50:15.626
<i>I felt, look, this guy</i>

50:15.627 --> 50:17.459
<i>is gonna hang for sure.</i>

50:18.626 --> 50:20.418
<i>He's the father of five</i>

50:20.419 --> 50:22.209
<i>kids, he has a wife,</i>

50:22.250 --> 50:24.083
<i>he was honest on the trial.</i>

50:24.125 --> 50:25.792
<i>Maybe he'll tell me something,</i>

50:25.834 --> 50:27.918
<i>you know tell my
children I love them,</i>

50:27.959 --> 50:29.709
<i>tell my wife I'm sorry.</i>

50:29.751 --> 50:32.792
<i>Nobody ever said
they were sorry.</i>

50:32.834 --> 50:35.417
<i>So I went down to talk to him,</i>

50:35.459 --> 50:37.876
<i>and he's locked up in a cell</i>

50:37.918 --> 50:40.584
<i>behind bars under the courthouse</i>

50:40.626 --> 50:43.792
<i>and a little window opens up,</i>

50:43.834 --> 50:47.918
<i>and I said to him.</i>

50:47.959 --> 50:50.209
<i>"Can I do something for you?"</i>

50:50.250 --> 50:52.417
<i>AND THEN HE BEGAN:</i>

50:52.418 --> 50:54.584
<i>"You'll see I was right."</i>

50:54.626 --> 50:57.959
The Russians are gonna
take over the Jews.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.042
"The Jews in America
will suffer."

51:00.083 --> 51:02.041
and he just goes
repeating the argument he

51:02.042 --> 51:03.792
read on the trial.

51:03.834 --> 51:06.459
I let him go for about a minute,

51:06.500 --> 51:08.126
and then I said, "Goodbye."

51:08.127 --> 51:09.751
"Mr. Ohlendorf" in English,

51:09.792 --> 51:11.292
closed the door and left.

51:11.334 --> 51:13.022
<i>The next thing I saw I was</i>

51:13.023 --> 51:14.709
<i>invited to come to the hanging.</i>

51:14.751 --> 51:16.168
<i>I refused to go, but they</i>

51:16.169 --> 51:17.584
<i>sent me the tape anyway</i>

51:17.626 --> 51:18.772
<i>so I have a picture of</i>

51:18.773 --> 51:19.918
<i>him hanging by the neck</i>

51:19.959 --> 51:22.626
<i>for eight minutes and
then pronounced dead.</i>

51:33.375 --> 51:35.729
<i>I wanted to go home, but then</i>

51:35.730 --> 51:38.083
<i>something terrible happened.</i>

51:39.792 --> 51:41.667
<i>I was approached by
Jewish organizations</i>

51:41.709 --> 51:43.042
and they said, "Hey boy",

51:45.626 --> 51:46.768
there's something
else to be done here.

51:46.792 --> 51:47.959
"What about the victims?"

51:48.042 --> 51:50.209
<i>And it didn't take
long to convince me</i>

51:50.250 --> 51:52.542
<i>they had managed to get a</i>

51:52.543 --> 51:54.834
<i>military government law enacted</i>

51:54.876 --> 51:57.334
<i>saying that the property
of murdered Jews</i>

51:57.375 --> 52:00.250
<i>would go not to
the German state,</i>

52:00.292 --> 52:03.292
<i>but to a consortium of
Jewish organizations</i>

52:03.334 --> 52:05.105
<i>which would use it for charity</i>

52:05.106 --> 52:06.876
<i>purposes of the survivors</i>

52:06.918 --> 52:09.792
and that sounded like
a very good idea,

52:09.834 --> 52:11.709
except they wanted
me to take it over

52:11.751 --> 52:13.083
and to do the job.

52:13.125 --> 52:14.813
<i>"I said," How long do</i>

52:14.814 --> 52:16.500
<i>they think it'll take?"</i>

52:16.542 --> 52:18.084
<i>They said, "Well, we'd like</i>

52:18.085 --> 52:19.626
<i>a commitment of two years."</i>

52:19.667 --> 52:21.792
<i>Well I went back
to my dear wife,</i>

52:21.834 --> 52:23.647
<i>"and she said," Well the</i>

52:23.648 --> 52:26.521
<i>cause seems good enough,
but they said two</i>

52:26.522 --> 52:27.542
<i>years but if I know you</i>

52:27.584 --> 52:29.792
<i>it'll only take one year.</i>

52:29.834 --> 52:31.334
<i>"So take the job."</i>

52:31.375 --> 52:34.542
Whereupon,
being the sole employee,

52:34.584 --> 52:36.542
I declared myself
the director general

52:36.584 --> 52:39.542
<i>and set about to recover</i>

52:39.584 --> 52:41.709
<i>the heirless unclaimed
Jewish property.</i>

52:41.751 --> 52:44.584
<i>Naturally,
the cemeteries were unclaimed</i>

52:44.626 --> 52:46.667
<i>because the Jewish
congregations which had</i>

52:46.709 --> 52:48.126
<i>built up these cemeteries</i>

52:48.127 --> 52:49.542
<i>for centuries were gone.</i>

52:49.584 --> 52:51.792
They were abolished,
and the cemeteries

52:51.834 --> 52:54.042
became property of the Reich.

52:54.083 --> 52:56.751
<i>So I immediately
asserted ownership</i>

52:56.792 --> 53:00.230
<i>of all these cemeteries
on behalf of the</i>

53:00.231 --> 53:01.417
<i>successor organization.</i>

53:02.834 --> 53:04.709
<i>All well and good,</i>

53:04.710 --> 53:06.584
<i>except the question arose</i>

53:06.626 --> 53:08.418
<i>who pays the course of the</i>

53:08.419 --> 53:10.209
<i>maintenance of the cemeteries?</i>

53:10.250 --> 53:12.417
<i>Hundreds of cemeteries.</i>

53:15.834 --> 53:17.022
<i>The Polish government</i>

53:17.023 --> 53:18.209
<i>and the Polish Red Cross</i>

53:18.250 --> 53:20.751
invited me to come to Poland

53:20.792 --> 53:23.959
and be their guest for a week.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.334
I said, "The only thing I really"

53:25.375 --> 53:26.768
wanted to see in
Poland was Auschwitz

53:26.792 --> 53:28.751
because I'd never been there

53:28.792 --> 53:30.512
"and it had been liberated
by the Russians."

53:33.083 --> 53:35.583
<i>The field behind Auschwitz</i>

53:35.584 --> 53:38.083
<i>is covered with wild grass.</i>

53:40.751 --> 53:42.792
<i>And under the grass,</i>

53:42.793 --> 53:45.001
<i>there was the fertilizer
taken from the</i>

53:45.002 --> 53:47.167
<i>crematorium, and I noticed</i>

53:47.209 --> 53:49.292
<i>there were some black bones.</i>

53:49.334 --> 53:51.209
<i>There were little
bones of some kind.</i>

53:51.250 --> 53:52.584
They may have been the bones

53:52.585 --> 53:53.918
of a child or of a hand,

53:53.959 --> 53:55.501
<i>and I picked them up and</i>

53:55.502 --> 53:57.042
<i>I put them in my pocket.</i>

53:57.083 --> 53:59.834
Somebody asked me
why am I doing that?

53:59.876 --> 54:01.459
I said, "I want to be reminded"

54:01.500 --> 54:03.209
what the hell I'm
doing in Germany."

54:04.792 --> 54:06.500
Anyway, the question comes up

54:06.542 --> 54:07.935
who's gonna maintain
those cemeteries,

54:07.959 --> 54:09.584
and at whose expense?

54:11.918 --> 54:13.501
<i>The Germans assure us that</i>

54:13.502 --> 54:15.083
<i>they will take care of it</i>

54:15.125 --> 54:16.522
<i>as they would their own</i>

54:16.523 --> 54:17.918
<i>cemeteries for 20 years.</i>

54:17.959 --> 54:19.250
<i>"I said," Wait a minute,</i>

54:19.292 --> 54:20.605
you take care of your own

54:20.606 --> 54:21.918
cemeteries for 20 years,

54:21.959 --> 54:23.897
but in Jewish tradition once

54:23.898 --> 54:25.834
"a cemetery, always a cemetery."

54:26.792 --> 54:29.792
<i>"One of them says," Mr.
Ferencz you know,</i>

54:29.834 --> 54:31.480
<i>be reasonable I mean, do</i>

54:31.481 --> 54:33.125
<i>you expect us to give them</i>

54:33.167 --> 54:35.001
<i>more rights than we give</i>

54:35.002 --> 54:36.834
<i>"to our own German citizens?"</i>

54:36.876 --> 54:38.792
At that point I exploded.

54:41.584 --> 54:44.792
I really got mad and
I pulled the bones out

54:44.834 --> 54:46.751
and I said, "If they were alive"

54:46.792 --> 54:48.021
they wouldn't ask you to

54:48.022 --> 54:49.250
take care of the cemeteries.

54:49.292 --> 54:51.351
- You killed them, that's.
- "Why they have to ask you!"

54:51.375 --> 54:54.459
And I pounded the
bones on the table

54:54.500 --> 54:55.896
and I said, "You want them"

54:55.897 --> 54:57.292
to pay you, ask 'em."

54:58.792 --> 55:00.501
And the high tension because

55:00.502 --> 55:02.209
I very seldom get angry.

55:03.959 --> 55:05.751
<i>The chairman was very wise.</i>

55:05.792 --> 55:07.417
<i>"He said," Meeting is</i>

55:07.418 --> 55:09.042
<i>adjourned for 15 minutes."</i>

55:09.083 --> 55:10.438
<i>And we all got up and</i>

55:10.439 --> 55:11.792
<i>they all left me to...</i>

55:13.918 --> 55:15.584
<i>We come back after 15 minutes</i>

55:15.626 --> 55:17.668
and the chairman says,

55:17.669 --> 55:19.709
"We accept your terms."

55:19.751 --> 55:20.959
Just like that.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.792
"Thank you very much."

55:22.834 --> 55:24.125
And I left as soon as I could.

55:24.167 --> 55:26.209
That meant that the
German government

55:26.250 --> 55:27.396
was legally responsible and

55:27.397 --> 55:29.605
I assume they've done
it 'cause they're

55:29.606 --> 55:30.626
pretty good that way,

55:30.667 --> 55:32.293
on maintaining all the Jewish

55:32.294 --> 55:33.918
cemeteries in perpetuity.

55:33.959 --> 55:35.500
That's a fortune.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.042
<i>Those bones clinched
the argument.</i>

55:40.083 --> 55:41.855
<i>Without the bones, it would</i>

55:41.856 --> 55:43.626
<i>not have happened, I'm sure.</i>

55:43.667 --> 55:47.000
<i>So I thought these
were historic bones,</i>

55:47.042 --> 55:50.000
<i>and I sent them to
the Holocaust Museum</i>

55:50.042 --> 55:51.792
<i>and I told them the story.</i>

55:58.375 --> 56:00.459
<i>My wife Gertrude
with whom I've been</i>

56:00.500 --> 56:02.918
<i>happily wed for over 71 years,</i>

56:04.834 --> 56:07.542
<i>she's also from
Transylvania as I am.</i>

56:08.792 --> 56:10.521
<i>She came to America when</i>

56:10.522 --> 56:12.250
<i>she was about 16 years old.</i>

56:12.292 --> 56:14.834
<i>Also no language,
no money, no skills.</i>

56:14.876 --> 56:16.730
<i>Immediately went to work</i>

56:16.731 --> 56:18.584
<i>and went to night school</i>

56:18.626 --> 56:20.230
<i>and got herself a Master's.</i>

56:20.231 --> 56:21.834
<i>Degree in due course</i>

56:21.876 --> 56:23.375
<i>and became a health teacher.</i>

56:26.375 --> 56:27.792
<i>I've been very fortunate</i>

56:27.834 --> 56:29.293
<i>because she has believed</i>

56:29.294 --> 56:30.751
<i>in what I was doing.</i>

56:30.792 --> 56:32.375
<i>She tolerated my absences</i>

56:32.417 --> 56:35.709
<i>when I was going on
trips around the world.</i>

56:37.584 --> 56:40.042
<i>My dad used to tuck
us in at night.</i>

56:40.083 --> 56:42.709
<i>He would tell us
stories every night.</i>

56:42.751 --> 56:44.292
<i>He would take each of his kids</i>

56:44.334 --> 56:46.105
<i>on what he called dates on</i>

56:46.106 --> 56:47.876
<i>the weekend, one at a time.</i>

56:47.918 --> 56:49.855
He used to play King of the Hill

56:49.856 --> 56:51.792
you know, Blind Man's Bluff

56:51.834 --> 56:53.792
<i>or whatever the games were.</i>

56:53.834 --> 56:56.334
<i>He was very involved
with his kids,</i>

56:56.375 --> 56:58.417
<i>particularly when we
were young growing up.</i>

56:58.459 --> 56:59.751
<i>So he made time for his kids.</i>

57:03.542 --> 57:04.876
<i>It was time to go home.</i>

57:06.459 --> 57:07.876
<i>I have my wife, I have four</i>

57:07.877 --> 57:09.292
<i>children born in Nuremberg.</i>

57:09.334 --> 57:10.751
I have to go home.

57:12.918 --> 57:13.918
<i>So I went home.</i>

57:15.292 --> 57:18.083
<i>"The big law firm
said, "Oh it's great.</i>

57:18.125 --> 57:20.417
<i>If we have to hang
Nazis, we'll call you.</i>

57:20.459 --> 57:21.834
<i>"You got any clients?"</i>

57:21.876 --> 57:23.167
<i>You know.</i>

57:23.209 --> 57:24.376
<i>So I began to take your</i>

57:24.377 --> 57:25.542
<i>typical New York cases.</i>

57:25.584 --> 57:26.792
<i>Somebody fell down the subway</i>

57:26.834 --> 57:29.083
<i>and broke a leg, okay you know?</i>

57:30.459 --> 57:32.834
Telford had a
similar experience.

57:32.876 --> 57:34.876
He came back and he
went into partnership

57:34.918 --> 57:38.375
with his brother-in-law
who happened to be

57:38.417 --> 57:39.876
the dean of the
Harvard Law School

57:39.918 --> 57:41.083
when he signed my diploma.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.250
<i>His name was Landis,
James Landis.</i>

57:44.292 --> 57:45.396
<i>"So he said," Ben, why don't</i>

57:45.397 --> 57:46.500
<i>you come in with us?"</i>

57:46.542 --> 57:48.709
It didn't bring us
any clients either.

57:48.751 --> 57:50.918
<i>But I was known as the lawyer</i>

57:50.959 --> 57:52.397
<i>who takes hopeless cases</i>

57:52.398 --> 57:53.834
<i>on a contingent fee.</i>

57:53.876 --> 57:56.230
<i>And what I did was I would</i>

57:56.231 --> 57:58.584
<i>find a moral situation</i>

57:58.626 --> 58:00.230
where the claimant didn't

58:00.231 --> 58:01.834
seem to have a chance,

58:01.876 --> 58:03.876
<i>but I felt it was right.</i>

58:03.918 --> 58:05.667
<i>I went after them
on a contingent fee</i>

58:05.709 --> 58:07.209
<i>which was usually much less</i>

58:07.210 --> 58:08.709
<i>than the normal contingent fee.</i>

58:08.751 --> 58:11.083
They practiced human rights law

58:11.125 --> 58:14.792
at a time when there
was no such thing.

58:14.834 --> 58:17.375
They practiced
civil liberties law.

58:17.417 --> 58:20.751
Every case they took
was a do-gooder case.

58:20.792 --> 58:24.542
Free speech cases,
anti-McCarthyism cases,

58:24.584 --> 58:27.209
every kind of case
that I wanted to take

58:27.250 --> 58:29.918
when I was a lawyer,
and I think that

58:29.959 --> 58:32.792
both Telford and Ben
had an enormous impact

58:32.834 --> 58:35.584
on a generation
of lawyers my age.

58:35.626 --> 58:37.626
I made enough money to

58:37.627 --> 58:39.626
invest it wisely and carefully,

58:39.667 --> 58:41.209
and so from being a poor

58:41.210 --> 58:42.751
boy I got to be a rich boy.

58:42.792 --> 58:44.334
And I gave away all my money.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.751
I'm in the process
of doing it still,

58:46.792 --> 58:48.959
including to Cardozo, Harvard.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.125
Law School, et cetera.

58:54.083 --> 58:56.250
Taylor went to Vietnam
and he wrote a book,

58:56.292 --> 58:57.751
Nuremberg in Vietnam in

58:57.752 --> 58:59.209
which he made the point

58:59.250 --> 59:01.626
<i>that the United States
forgot the lessons</i>

59:01.667 --> 59:04.042
<i>we tried to teach the
world in Nuremberg.</i>

59:04.083 --> 59:06.563
And he was an outspoken

59:06.564 --> 59:09.042
critic of the McCarthy regime.

59:09.083 --> 59:12.167
He was very courageous,
absolutely correct,

59:12.209 --> 59:15.417
a good writer,
high moral standards.

59:15.459 --> 59:18.709
<i>He deserved much
more recognition</i>

59:18.751 --> 59:21.209
<i>and responsibility than he had.</i>

59:22.751 --> 59:24.001
<i>He was an excellent lawyer and</i>

59:24.002 --> 59:25.250
<i>never properly appreciated.</i>

59:40.626 --> 59:44.876
<i>We are in a time where
we find the world</i>

59:44.918 --> 59:47.626
<i>in many different areas</i>

59:47.667 --> 59:49.667
<i>in heinous, horrible conflicts.</i>

59:51.709 --> 59:53.793
<i>And the world after the</i>

59:53.794 --> 59:58.064
<i>fall of the Berlin
Wall had the hope and</i>

59:58.065 --> 01:00:01.855
<i>expectation that
we'll be in a more</i>

01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:05.646
<i>peaceful environment</i>
and this turned out to

01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:07.792
be a horrible fallacy.

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:10.063
You know after the.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.334
Holocaust we said never again

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.396
and we've seen it again and

01:00:13.397 --> 01:00:15.417
again and again and again

01:00:15.459 --> 01:00:17.105
<i>and there's no indication</i>

01:00:17.106 --> 01:00:18.751
<i>that it's going to end.</i>

01:00:20.876 --> 01:00:22.751
<i>We are now
spending even more money</i>

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:25.417
to be in an arms race.

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.105
Who can build the weapons

01:00:27.106 --> 01:00:28.751
to kill more people?

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.834
<i>That is the current
state of the world,</i>

01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:32.834
<i>and we have to recognize that</i>

01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:36.083
<i>the only way out of THIS:
Law, not war.</i>

01:00:37.959 --> 01:00:41.250
<i>The world is struggling
for an answer.</i>

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:44.083
<i>And an answer could be</i>

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:46.667
<i>found in international
criminal law.</i>

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.959
<i>Law could be an answer to</i>

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.918
<i>conflicts with human suffering</i>

01:00:53.959 --> 01:00:57.000
<i>of an almost unseen nature.</i>

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:03.001
<i>The time has come, guys</i>

01:01:03.002 --> 01:01:04.792
<i>to stop this killing.</i>

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:06.522
<i>Have a court settle your</i>

01:01:06.523 --> 01:01:08.209
<i>disputes by peaceful means,</i>

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.000
<i>and until you do
that, you're going to</i>

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:11.792
<i>continue killing yourselves.</i>

01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:14.834
And it's just common sense.

01:01:14.876 --> 01:01:15.751
We have international crimes,

01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.709
you need an international court.

01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.084
So I began to write on the

01:01:19.085 --> 01:01:20.417
international criminal court.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.602
<i>I remember as a young lawyer</i>

01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:26.959
<i>very interested in
international law</i>

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.626
<i>I was with an
international law firm.</i>

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:30.875
<i>I probably was the only</i>

01:01:30.876 --> 01:01:32.083
<i>person in the law firm</i>

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:35.500
<i>that bought Ben's books</i>

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:36.917
because I was so impressed

01:01:36.918 --> 01:01:39.709
with what Ben Ferencz
had written in 1980

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.083
about you have to build

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.542
an international criminal court.

01:01:42.584 --> 01:01:45.500
You have these individuals who

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:48.250
become part of
international law making

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:50.876
that have an enormous
individual impact

01:01:50.918 --> 01:01:52.792
<i>and Ben was that.</i>

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.542
<i>He worked for decades to</i>

01:01:54.543 --> 01:01:56.250
<i>try and get a replacement</i>

01:01:56.292 --> 01:01:57.834
<i>for the Nuremberg Tribunals</i>

01:01:57.876 --> 01:02:00.250
<i>within the United
Nations General Assembly,</i>

01:02:00.292 --> 01:02:02.876
<i>an international criminal court.</i>

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:05.584
I was the ambassador at

01:02:05.585 --> 01:02:06.751
large for war crimes issues

01:02:06.792 --> 01:02:08.396
during the second term of

01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:10.000
the Clinton administration.

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:13.834
Ben Ferencz was one
hell of a lobbyist.

01:02:13.876 --> 01:02:17.042
<i>He reminded me of
Raphael Lemkin who</i>

01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:18.167
<i>you know was the father</i>

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.250
<i>of the Genocide Convention</i>

01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:20.626
<i>and spent the 1950s going</i>

01:02:20.627 --> 01:02:21.959
<i>up and down Capitol Hill</i>

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.042
<i>urging ratification of the.</i>

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:26.250
<i>Genocide Convention
by the United States.</i>

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:29.042
Well Ben Ferencz was
there in the 1990s

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:34.042
pressing hard and he kept at me.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.125
And he was persistent.

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:39.918
He's knocking on
every delegate's door

01:02:39.959 --> 01:02:41.918
to try and get them to support

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.834
a strong international
criminal court,

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:46.855
and the mantra that you hear

01:02:46.856 --> 01:02:48.834
when you interview him today

01:02:48.876 --> 01:02:51.417
is the mantra that
he had back then

01:02:51.459 --> 01:02:53.147
about the importance of

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.834
justice and the rule of law.

01:02:54.876 --> 01:02:56.500
It not only in
international affairs

01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:58.417
but in the survival
of the human race.

01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:12.292
<i>It becomes reachable in Rome.</i>

01:03:24.209 --> 01:03:26.125
<i>I made an opening
statement there.</i>

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:28.918
They invited me
because they knew me.

01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:30.355
I went to all the meetings,

01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:31.751
and I wrote papers.

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:33.768
- I wrote you know hundreds and.
- Dozens of articles, speeches,

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:34.912
Lectures, nagging and so on.

01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:41.935
<i>- I said, "The place is.
- Here, the time is now,".</i>

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:44.105
And I began it by saying,

01:03:44.106 --> 01:03:47.938
"I have come to speak
for those who cannot

01:03:47.939 --> 01:03:49.584
speak, the victims."

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.751
<i>Well the time is fall of 2000.</i>

01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:04.417
<i>We're coming towards the end</i>

01:04:04.418 --> 01:04:05.792
<i>of the Clinton administration</i>.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.396
<i>We have a deadline, which</i>

01:04:09.397 --> 01:04:11.709
<i>is December 31, 2000.</i>

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:14.751
The last opportunity
for any country

01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:16.584
to sign the Rome Statute.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.918
<i>In the government I
was working feverishly</i>

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.876
<i>to get President Clinton</i>

01:04:21.877 --> 01:04:23.792
<i>to that decision point.</i>

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:25.167
<i>But you know, it's a funny thing</i>

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:27.542
<i>about government and
about presidents.</i>

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:30.709
<i>You can do an enormous
amount internally</i>

01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:34.375
<i>to get everything lined
up and to his desk,</i>

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:36.000
<i>you know in big
three ring binders</i>

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:39.084
<i>where he's going to
sit down and diligently</i>

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:42.334
<i>consider this issue,</i>
but to really trigger

01:04:42.335 --> 01:04:44.209
that man's interest

01:04:45.792 --> 01:04:47.001
you have to have something

01:04:47.002 --> 01:04:48.209
hit him from the outside.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.334
You just have to have it.

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:52.105
Well, with respect to the

01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:53.834
international criminal court,

01:04:54.918 --> 01:04:58.125
that moment arrived not on TV.

01:04:58.167 --> 01:04:59.543
It arrived on the op-ed

01:04:59.544 --> 01:05:00.918
page of the Washington Post

01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:03.188
by two men, Ben Ferencz

01:05:03.189 --> 01:05:05.417
and Robert McNamara.

01:05:05.459 --> 01:05:07.751
<i>Our 50 billion dollar
defense program</i>

01:05:07.792 --> 01:05:09.751
<i>is explained by secretary</i>

01:05:09.752 --> 01:05:11.709
<i>of defense McNamara.</i>

01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:13.792
<i>In the past year,
we've doubled the rate</i>

01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:15.792
<i>of building Polaris submarines.</i>

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:19.209
<i>One day, I had a call.</i>

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.876
<i>My wife took the message.</i>

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.918
<i>She's saying secretary.</i>

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.918
<i>McNamara wanted to talk to you.</i>

01:05:26.125 --> 01:05:27.501
<i>And he said I want you</i>

01:05:27.502 --> 01:05:28.876
<i>to write an op-ed piece</i>

01:05:28.918 --> 01:05:30.418
for the New York Times,

01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:31.918
which both of us can sign

01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:34.042
calling on the United
States to sign on

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:35.667
to the international
criminal court.

01:05:35.709 --> 01:05:38.500
Remember who these people are.

01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:42.709
Ben Ferencz,
prosecutor from Nuremberg.

01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:44.772
Unimpeachable credentials,

01:05:44.773 --> 01:05:46.792
but who's the other guy?

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:49.167
<i>Robert McNamara, the</i>

01:05:49.168 --> 01:05:51.500
<i>architect of the Vietnam War.</i>

01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:54.751
<i>My response to him in</i>

01:05:54.752 --> 01:05:56.125
<i>practically these
words I'm sure,</i>

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:58.918
<i>"Mr.
Secretary I think you realize"</i>

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:00.876
<i>that if we had such a court,</i>

01:06:00.918 --> 01:06:03.792
<i>"you might be one of
the first defendants."</i>

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.626
<i>He said I know that.</i>

01:06:05.667 --> 01:06:06.834
<i>I said then why do you ask me</i>

01:06:06.876 --> 01:06:09.751
<i>to get the United
States to sign on?</i>

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:11.626
<i>He said,
"I didn't know it was illegal."</i>

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.292
<i>we're talking the Vietnam War.</i>

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:15.751
"If I had known,
I wouldn't have done it."

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:17.230
I said, "Okay."

01:06:17.231 --> 01:06:18.667
I drafted the letter.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:23.751
That was a very
powerful partnership

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:26.751
and you bet President
Bill Clinton

01:06:26.792 --> 01:06:28.083
would read that op-ed.

01:06:30.584 --> 01:06:32.459
<i>And if there's anything
anyone should know</i>

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.876
<i>about president Clinton is</i>

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:35.001
<i>he actually makes decisions</i>

01:06:35.002 --> 01:06:36.083
<i>at the last moment.</i>

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:39.021
He makes good decisions,
but he does wait

01:06:39.022 --> 01:06:40.250
until the last moment,

01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:41.813
and so he did finally

01:06:41.814 --> 01:06:43.334
reach that decision early

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:47.751
<i>of December 31st and
I was authorized then</i>

01:06:47.792 --> 01:06:49.667
<i>to go to New York
and sign the treaty.</i>

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.792
Well on December
30th I receive a call

01:06:53.834 --> 01:06:57.042
<i>instructing me to
get a train ticket</i>

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.771
<i>for the next morning on Amtrak</i>

01:06:58.772 --> 01:07:02.292
<i>so that I'm in New
York, and it happened to</i>

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.292
<i>be a huge snowstorm</i>

01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:03.897
<i>"but they said," The President</i>

01:07:03.898 --> 01:07:05.459
<i>has not made a decision yet,</i>

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.000
"but we want you on that train,"

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:08.000
because there were no flights.

01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:10.250
The weather was preventing that.

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.230
<i>"You'll receive instructions</i>

01:07:12.231 --> 01:07:14.167
<i>when you arrive in New York,"</i>

01:07:14.209 --> 01:07:16.167
<i>and I finally got
to Penn Station</i>

01:07:16.209 --> 01:07:18.230
and I still had not received

01:07:18.231 --> 01:07:20.250
the final instruction.

01:07:20.292 --> 01:07:24.542
I'm riding up the
escalator at Penn Station

01:07:24.584 --> 01:07:26.272
<i>and I receive a call from</i>

01:07:26.273 --> 01:07:27.959
<i>the Secretary of State,</i>

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.876
<i>Madeleine Albright, my boss.</i>

01:07:30.918 --> 01:07:32.835
<i>She informed me that the</i>

01:07:32.836 --> 01:07:34.751
<i>president had made the decision</i>

01:07:34.792 --> 01:07:36.375
that the treaty would be signed

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:37.918
and that I had authority now

01:07:37.959 --> 01:07:39.376
to proceed to the United.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:40.792
Nations to sign the document.

01:07:40.834 --> 01:07:42.438
<i>New York City was</i>

01:07:42.439 --> 01:07:44.042
<i>completely covered by snow.</i>

01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:46.209
<i>There were no taxis running,</i>

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:48.334
<i>and so I had my snow boots on</i>

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.584
<i>and I hiked from Penn Station</i>

01:07:49.585 --> 01:07:50.792
<i>to the United Nations.</i>

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.042
<i>The UN had to open just for me</i>

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:55.667
<i>to walk in and sign the treaty,</i>

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:56.810
<i>because it was closed that day.</i>

01:07:56.834 --> 01:07:58.209
<i>It was New Year's Eve.</i>

01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:59.959
<i>They close at the UN.</i>

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.438
<i>And I walked in to the room</i>

01:08:02.439 --> 01:08:04.876
<i>where treaties are signed,</i>

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:06.689
and there was a very small

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.459
group of people to witness it.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.209
Very interesting.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.042
The last official act of the.

01:08:13.043 --> 01:08:14.834
President of the United States

01:08:14.876 --> 01:08:17.082
when is everybody sound asleep

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:19.584
and he has his ambassador
go sneak in there

01:08:19.626 --> 01:08:20.706
and sign the goddamn thing.

01:08:23.876 --> 01:08:25.751
<i>Unfortunately what George W.
Bush did</i>

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:27.709
<i>was that he said,
"with respect to that</i>"

01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:30.500
<i>signature on the
treaty, we're no longer</i>

01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:32.334
<i>going to perform our obligation</i>

01:08:32.335 --> 01:08:34.125
<i>"as a signatory state."</i>

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:36.626
So that was the
downslide after the

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:38.709
Clinton administration,
much to my regret.

01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:41.500
And that's the
political process.

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:43.459
Or as Churchill's
reported to have said,

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.395
"It's a terrible system, but he

01:08:45.397 --> 01:08:47.292
can't think of a better one."

01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:15.604
<i>When we started this, every</i>

01:09:15.606 --> 01:09:17.459
<i>time we met with a UN leader</i>

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.292
<i>or a government they said.</i>

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:21.584
<i>"We'll work on this</i>
but it'll never happen,

01:09:21.585 --> 01:09:23.459
not in your
lifetime, not in your

01:09:21.626 --> 01:09:23.459
"children's lifetime,"

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.126
and less than four years

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.751
later we had a treaty.

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.584
Then we were told the treaty

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:30.375
would take 20, 25 years

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:31.709
like the law of the sea

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:33.000
to get 60 ratification.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.792
<i>Again,
four years later we had that.</i>

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:40.292
<i>It is simply not
plausible anymore to argue</i>

01:09:40.334 --> 01:09:44.167
that any political
or military leader

01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:46.688
who is responsible for the

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:49.167
commission of atrocity crimes

01:09:49.209 --> 01:09:51.375
has the right to
get away with it.

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:53.751
<i>Nuremberg started that process.</i>

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:56.459
<i>We got detracted
by the Cold War.</i>

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.146
<i>The Cold War ended, we</i>

01:09:58.147 --> 01:09:59.792
<i>regenerated the process</i>

01:09:59.834 --> 01:10:01.751
<i>in order to hold these</i>

01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:04.730
<i>individuals responsible
and to send a loud</i>

01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:07.646
<i>and clear signal</i>
you are subject to

01:10:07.647 --> 01:10:09.500
criminal law, period

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:10.647
and you cannot negotiate

01:10:10.648 --> 01:10:11.751
your way out of it.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.292
May it please your honors,

01:10:16.959 --> 01:10:20.209
this is a historic
moment in the evolution

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.500
of international criminal law.

01:10:23.834 --> 01:10:25.688
For the first time a permanent

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:27.542
international criminal court

01:10:27.584 --> 01:10:29.730
will hear the closing statement

01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:31.876
for the prosecution

01:10:31.918 --> 01:10:34.375
and it concludes its first case

01:10:34.417 --> 01:10:36.480
against its first accused,

01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:38.542
Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.

01:10:39.792 --> 01:10:42.167
<i>When the court finally
gets its first case,</i>

01:10:42.209 --> 01:10:43.667
<i>they asked me to do the closing</i>

01:10:43.668 --> 01:10:45.125
<i>statement I'm 92 years old.</i>

01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:47.917
<i>This is against a guy who had</i>

01:10:47.918 --> 01:10:49.167
<i>been using child soldiers.</i>

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:52.268
<i>- They go and say, "You give.
- Us food, give us money,".</i>

01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:53.396
<i>And if you have no money</i>

01:10:53.397 --> 01:10:54.500
<i>to give them and no food</i>

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.727
<i>- they go, "Oh you got a couple.
- Of kids, we'll take the kids,".</i>

01:10:56.751 --> 01:11:00.125
<i>And they were taking kids 13, 14</i>

01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:01.976
<i>- and the boys they taught.
- 'em how to use a gun.</i>

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.250
<i>The kids loved the
excitement of that,</i>

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:05.542
<i>and they taught 'em how to kill</i>

01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:07.500
<i>and that happens
to be a war crime.</i>

01:11:08.626 --> 01:11:10.334
<i>When the statute
that binds this court</i>

01:11:10.375 --> 01:11:13.417
was overwhelmingly approved,

01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:17.626
over 100 sovereign
states decided

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:20.792
<i>that child recruitment
and forcing them</i>

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:23.834
to participate in
hostilities were

01:11:23.876 --> 01:11:25.709
and I'm quoting now
from the statute,

01:11:25.751 --> 01:11:29.209
"among the most serious
crimes of concern

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.750
<i>"for the international</i>

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.250
<i>community as a whole."</i>

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.584
<i>This was the first ICC case,</i>

01:11:34.626 --> 01:11:37.876
and I believe that
it was only fitting

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:40.043
that from Nuremberg, Ben.

01:11:40.044 --> 01:11:43.480
Ferencz, to the Hague,
it was only fitting

01:11:43.481 --> 01:11:44.751
that he would be called

01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:47.146
to do the closing remarks

01:11:47.147 --> 01:11:49.500
of this historic case.

01:11:50.792 --> 01:11:53.459
What makes this
court so distinctive

01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:57.147
is its primary goal to deter

01:11:57.148 --> 01:11:59.542
crimes before they take place

01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:03.542
by letting wrongdoers
know in advance

01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:06.626
that they will be
called to account

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:08.230
by an impartial

01:12:08.231 --> 01:12:09.792
international criminal court.

01:12:09.834 --> 01:12:11.542
It's not an easy feat to

01:12:11.543 --> 01:12:13.250
create an institution like this.

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:14.417
It requires courage,

01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:15.542
it requires leadership,

01:12:15.584 --> 01:12:17.751
it requires the right moment

01:12:17.752 --> 01:12:19.918
in historical perspective.

01:12:19.959 --> 01:12:21.500
It requires political will.

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:23.626
<i>Without Ben, his contribution</i>

01:12:23.627 --> 01:12:25.709
<i>and people like him,</i>

01:12:25.751 --> 01:12:28.059
<i>- this field will not have.
- Evolved the way it already has.</i>

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.667
<i>We still have a long way to go,</i>

01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:31.709
<i>but it's still an
incredible achievement.</i>

01:12:31.751 --> 01:12:32.814
<i>Ben has played a critical</i>

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.751
<i>role in the evolution</i>
of international

01:12:33.918 --> 01:12:35.751
criminal justice

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:37.167
and in the creation of the ICC.

01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:38.480
Rome Statute for the.

01:12:38.481 --> 01:12:39.751
International Criminal Court

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.084
is one of the strongest

01:12:41.085 --> 01:12:42.375
if not the strongest

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:44.522
<i>international law treaty</i>

01:12:44.523 --> 01:12:46.626
<i>since the end of World War II.</i>

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:49.709
<i>You now have an
institution in the Hague</i>

01:12:49.751 --> 01:12:51.251
<i>to hold individuals,</i>

01:12:51.252 --> 01:12:52.751
<i>no matter who they are,</i>

01:12:52.792 --> 01:12:53.834
<i>responsible for committing</i>

01:12:53.835 --> 01:12:54.876
<i>these worst crimes.</i>

01:12:54.918 --> 01:12:57.209
And that's something to continue

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.500
to be very positive about

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.751
and to do everything

01:13:00.752 --> 01:13:01.959
you can to make it work.

01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:05.167
But the job is not done.

01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:09.709
Now we need to persuade
the other states

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:12.500
to be part of this, this ICC.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500
<i>The United States has</i>

01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:18.626
<i>signed the Rome Statute
and the signature</i>

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:19.709
<i>is still there.</i>

01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:24.542
<i>The problem is,
we are not a ratified party</i>

01:13:24.584 --> 01:13:26.167
<i>to the Rome Statute.</i>

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:28.292
You know this is part of a

01:13:28.293 --> 01:13:30.375
much larger picture in America.

01:13:30.417 --> 01:13:32.271
We often describe ourselves

01:13:32.272 --> 01:13:34.125
as the exceptional nation.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.792
<i>We discipline ourselves,</i>

01:13:36.793 --> 01:13:39.417
<i>but we're not eager</i>

01:13:39.459 --> 01:13:41.292
<i>to have any international regime</i>

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:45.751
<i>with supreme authority
discipline us.</i>

01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:47.376
The attitude is, "Well the."

01:13:47.377 --> 01:13:48.959
United States does this already,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.626
or the United
States Constitution

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:51.976
already has these
protections in it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.542
<i>Why should we
sacrifice any of that</i>

01:13:54.584 --> 01:13:56.168
<i>to an international</i>

01:13:56.169 --> 01:13:57.751
<i>"regime of any character?"</i>

01:13:57.792 --> 01:14:00.042
<i>Why, because we're the
exceptional nation.</i>

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:01.667
<i>We will meet all
of these standards,</i>

01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:03.293
but we meet them on our

01:14:03.294 --> 01:14:06.314
terms, not on the terms
being dictated from

01:14:06.315 --> 01:14:07.709
an international body.

01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:09.751
From the outset, the United.

01:14:09.752 --> 01:14:12.959
States was concerned
that maybe it wouldn't

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.125
always be objective.

01:14:14.167 --> 01:14:15.709
That since we were doing

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.250
a lot of the peacekeeping

01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:20.250
and the intervening,
maybe we'd be held

01:14:20.292 --> 01:14:23.000
specifically
specially accountable

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:28.042
by rival powers who
were on the other side,

01:14:28.876 --> 01:14:31.918
either overtly or covertly.

01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:33.876
And so we couldn't go along.

01:14:33.918 --> 01:14:36.689
U.S. policy makers will say

01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:39.459
it's fine for the Belgians

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.230
and the Brazilians, but we're

01:14:42.231 --> 01:14:44.959
the greatest country on Earth.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
We don't need to be
subject to the same law

01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:51.918
that applies to everyone else.

01:14:51.959 --> 01:14:53.188
And that's true for

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:54.417
Russia, it's true for China,

01:14:54.459 --> 01:14:56.626
it's true for Pakistan and

01:14:56.627 --> 01:14:58.792
India and Israel and Indonesia.

01:14:58.834 --> 01:15:01.355
And most of the Arab world,

01:15:01.356 --> 01:15:03.876
and we're just not there yet.

01:15:03.918 --> 01:15:07.417
There are 124 countries
that have joined

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:09.375
the International
Criminal Court.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.417
That's unfortunate.

01:15:11.459 --> 01:15:14.918
It's a loss in credibility

01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:19.709
in terms of US policy
when these crimes

01:15:19.751 --> 01:15:21.751
arise anywhere in the world.

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:27.751
<i>No country which
prefers to use its power</i>

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:29.105
<i>rather than the rule of law</i>

01:15:29.106 --> 01:15:30.417
<i>would vote for the rule of law.</i>

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.751
<i>That's logical.</i>

01:15:31.792 --> 01:15:34.250
<i>That's still the
situation today.</i>

01:15:34.292 --> 01:15:35.938
<i>There are some people who do</i>

01:15:35.939 --> 01:15:37.584
<i>not trust the rule of law,</i>

01:15:37.626 --> 01:15:39.438
<i>and they prefer to use military</i>

01:15:39.439 --> 01:15:41.250
<i>power to achieve their goals</i>

01:15:41.292 --> 01:15:42.563
<i>as they decide and when</i>

01:15:42.564 --> 01:15:43.834
<i>they decide they should.</i>

01:15:43.876 --> 01:15:45.626
That's led by the United States

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.313
to which China replies,

01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:48.959
when you're ready to change

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.500
and give it up, come see me.

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:51.896
We'll talk about it then

01:15:51.897 --> 01:15:53.250
and the Russians say

01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:54.292
we're not trusting you.

01:15:54.334 --> 01:15:55.417
We don't trust anybody.

01:15:55.459 --> 01:15:57.751
<i>So we have this
political tension</i>

01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:59.542
<i>still exists in the world</i>

01:15:59.584 --> 01:16:00.688
<i>and they're still talking</i>

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:01.792
<i>about using weaponry</i>

01:16:01.834 --> 01:16:03.563
<i>to settle their disputes,</i>

01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.292
<i>not seeming to realize</i>

01:16:05.334 --> 01:16:07.813
<i>how very devastating and</i>

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.292
<i>dangerous that is to themselves</i>

01:16:10.334 --> 01:16:11.876
<i>and to their people.</i>

01:16:14.167 --> 01:16:15.751
<i>It's decisive.</i>

01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:17.834
<i>War will make mass murderers</i>

01:16:17.835 --> 01:16:19.876
<i>out of otherwise decent people</i>

01:16:19.918 --> 01:16:21.418
and I have seen it again

01:16:21.419 --> 01:16:22.918
and again and again.

01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:24.375
And it's inevitable.

01:16:24.417 --> 01:16:25.813
They become mass murderers

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.209
whether they are Americans,

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.876
or they're Germans,
or anybody else.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.751
That's the effect of war.

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:35.042
My answer to that
is stop war making.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.602
Well, how are you
gonna stop war making?

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:38.500
It's been glorified
for centuries.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.250
Yes, it has been glorified.

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:42.792
It's time to stop before
you kill everybody

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.772
and we're on that path too, so

01:16:44.773 --> 01:16:46.709
you got to make up your mind.

01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:48.417
Either you're going
to try to behave

01:16:48.459 --> 01:16:50.250
in a humane and rational way,

01:16:50.292 --> 01:16:51.626
or you're going
to kill everybody.

01:16:51.667 --> 01:16:54.417
Goodbye kids, I'm 95
years, 98 years old.

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:56.000
Not my world.

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:57.500
That's my message.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.375
<i>From the examples that.</i>

01:17:01.376 --> 01:17:03.250
<i>Ben has given all of us,</i>

01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:05.584
<i>he has never wavered, never.</i>

01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:08.751
<i>He believes that we can</i>

01:17:08.752 --> 01:17:10.709
<i>achieve justice for humanity.</i>

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:14.334
<i>This is one person, you know.</i>

01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:18.334
One great man in history

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:22.209
who continues to give his best.

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.667
Who continues to
show his commitment.

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:26.188
Who continues to show that

01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:27.667
this world can be better.

01:17:28.959 --> 01:17:30.334
I don't think a personal

01:17:30.335 --> 01:17:31.709
legacy is important to him.

01:17:31.751 --> 01:17:33.626
I think it is important

01:17:33.627 --> 01:17:35.500
to him that we advance

01:17:35.542 --> 01:17:37.084
<i>the rule of law, advance</i>

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:38.626
<i>the ball for all humankind</i>

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:39.792
<i>to diminish suffering.</i>

01:17:40.834 --> 01:17:42.417
Good afternoon young lady.

01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:48.416
Ben's presence and his tireless

01:17:48.417 --> 01:17:52.791
efforts are still needed
<i>in reminding us of.</i>

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:55.667
<i>Nuremberg and a good thing</i>

01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:56.876
<i>that was started there</i>

01:17:56.877 --> 01:17:58.042
<i>to be continued today</i>

01:17:58.083 --> 01:17:59.771
<i>and to be brought into</i>

01:17:59.772 --> 01:18:01.459
<i>these new institutions.</i>

01:18:04.125 --> 01:18:05.727
<i>- Think this is what keeps.
- Him going, keeps him young.</i>

01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:07.959
You know he's very
committed to this idea

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.500
that law as you know
is better than war.

01:18:13.918 --> 01:18:16.834
<i>I work incredible hours.</i>

01:18:16.876 --> 01:18:18.376
<i>I work starting sometimes</i>

01:18:18.377 --> 01:18:19.876
<i>seven o'clock in the morning</i>

01:18:19.918 --> 01:18:21.459
<i>'til 10 o'clock at night.</i>

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.792
<i>I don't know what a holiday is.</i>

01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:25.000
<i>I don't know what
retirement means.</i>

01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:27.167
<i>I have no desire to go play golf</i>

01:18:27.209 --> 01:18:28.959
<i>or to go fishing, things</i>

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.375
<i>that normal people
do when they retire.</i>

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.292
<i>I mean if all he had</i>

01:18:36.293 --> 01:18:38.125
<i>done was argue at the age of 27</i>

01:18:38.167 --> 01:18:40.876
<i>in front of the
Nuremberg Tribunal,</i>

01:18:40.918 --> 01:18:42.459
<i>I would've said,</i>

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.000
<i>"That's a remarkable person."</i>

01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:46.397
<i>To go on and use that as the</i>

01:18:46.398 --> 01:18:50.001
<i>fire that ignites his
soul and his brain on</i>

01:18:50.002 --> 01:18:52.521
<i>behalf of humanity</i>
is what makes him

01:18:52.522 --> 01:18:53.792
an iconic figure,

01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:55.397
and the reason it's iconic

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:56.959
is because he never forgot

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.917
what he saw and heard, and

01:18:58.918 --> 01:19:00.834
he's used it to make it better

01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:03.334
not for him, for everybody else

01:19:03.375 --> 01:19:04.751
<i>so he's a conscience.</i>

01:19:04.792 --> 01:19:06.813
<i>He's a roving conscience</i>

01:19:06.814 --> 01:19:10.459
<i>that says to people,
"This isn't right.</i>"

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.876
<i>You can't do this.</i>

01:19:11.918 --> 01:19:12.918
<i>"This is wrong."</i>

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:19.313
<i>I consider myself very</i>

01:19:19.314 --> 01:19:21.792
<i>fortunate to have been able to</i>

01:19:21.834 --> 01:19:24.042
<i>go from rags to riches,</i>

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.000
<i>to have been married to a woman</i>

01:19:26.042 --> 01:19:28.125
<i>with whom I have
never had a quarrel</i>

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:29.876
<i>and she's 98 years old.</i>

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:33.626
<i>We've been married
for over 71 years.</i>

01:19:36.459 --> 01:19:38.626
<i>I have survived
the battles of war.</i>

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.792
<i>So life has been good to me.</i>

01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.042
And I have no

01:19:50.667 --> 01:19:53.147
wish other than to serve the.

01:19:53.148 --> 01:19:55.626
United States and the world

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:58.147
by trying to make it a more

01:19:58.148 --> 01:20:00.626
humane and peaceful world order.

01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:02.876
That's my goal in life.
