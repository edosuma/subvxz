02:42.500 --> 02:43.870
Hello, Ugly.

02:44.895 --> 02:46.385
Here.

04:49.485 --> 04:50.626
Celia?

04:52.228 --> 04:54.711
I can't come tomorrow,
so I've come today.

04:57.624 --> 04:58.701
Bill?

04:58.741 --> 05:01.800
-I fed him.
-You what?

05:01.838 --> 05:03.110
He looked hungry.

05:03.146 --> 05:05.475
Can I look at your photographs?

05:05.508 --> 05:07.643
No.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.575
-I could describe them for you.
-No.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.239
Want me to walk you to the safe?

05:17.447 --> 05:20.309
I know my way around, thank you.

05:33.727 --> 05:35.610
You owe me $30.

05:35.643 --> 05:37.329
The place is spotless.

05:37.366 --> 05:39.945
It still smells in here,
but that's the dog.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.822
There's no food in the house.

05:48.858 --> 05:51.633
I could get some groceries and
cook you dinner for an extra 10.

05:55.275 --> 05:57.603
-I'm eating out.
-Where?

05:57.637 --> 06:00.020
I'm not going to tell you.

06:00.063 --> 06:01.465
You'll have to tell me...

06:01.498 --> 06:03.381
if I'm going to make
the reservation.

06:03.414 --> 06:05.003
I'll make it myself.

06:07.661 --> 06:09.630
Well, don't order fish.

06:09.671 --> 06:11.966
You know you can't handle
the bones.

06:19.631 --> 06:22.012
See you next week, then, Martin.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.201
What are you doing?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.380
Martin, I've told you before--

08:08.419 --> 08:10.236
you can't touch people
whenever you want.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.152
Fingers--
they aren't the same as eyes.

08:12.184 --> 08:13.709
It's rude.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.666
Excuse me.

08:40.755 --> 08:42.636
Why don't you
scrape them yourself?

08:42.669 --> 08:45.598
-Who's serving the blind guy?
-You are.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.698
-I've got three tables already.
-Has he ordered yet?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.771
I'll open this wine for you.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.215
Excuse me.

08:52.248 --> 08:55.555
-Hooray.
-Sorry about the delay.

08:55.599 --> 08:58.461
What's this?
This isn't what I ordered.

08:58.503 --> 09:00.766
That's the mixed pasta
you ordered.

09:00.802 --> 09:02.686
No.
I ordered chicken and asparagus.

09:02.718 --> 09:06.354
No. I'm sorry.
You said mixed pasta.

09:06.389 --> 09:08.554
I know what I ordered.
What's your name?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.474
-I beg your pardon?
-What's your name?

09:10.506 --> 09:12.955
-What's your name?
-I want the manager.

09:12.996 --> 09:14.879
I wanted chicken with asparagus.

09:14.911 --> 09:16.087
Oh! Oh! Oh, no!

09:16.125 --> 09:18.486
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.521
I'd like minestrone soup...

09:20.562 --> 09:23.750
followed by fettucini
with mushroom and cream sauce...

09:23.785 --> 09:25.919
and a side salad.

09:30.968 --> 09:33.100
Yeah.
I'll see you in the morning.

09:52.323 --> 09:53.433
Hey.

09:57.271 --> 09:59.632
You may be blind, but you still
have to pay for what you ate.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.559
I ate nothing.
My meal never arrived.

10:04.964 --> 10:06.074
Hey.

10:08.796 --> 10:09.970
Yes?

10:11.668 --> 10:13.094
You killed Ugly.

10:14.157 --> 10:16.453
I think you broke his neck.

10:28.012 --> 10:29.350
It's not dead.

10:29.384 --> 10:31.006
Oh, shit. Sorry, Ugly.

10:46.622 --> 10:48.526
Where are you taking him?

10:50.451 --> 10:52.781
I know someone who can help.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.895
Need a lift?

11:39.229 --> 11:42.090
-You like cats?
-Not particularly.

11:45.388 --> 11:48.795
I suppose you reckon
you owe him or something.

11:53.529 --> 11:55.913
He's a real freak, this cat.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.265
Here. Hold him.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.295
Where you going?

12:07.894 --> 12:10.757
How much light is there in here?

12:12.682 --> 12:14.564
Quite a bit.

12:14.599 --> 12:17.242
There's a lot of people.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.575
Tell me
when I'm pointing at you.

12:19.609 --> 12:21.492
You're pointing at the queen.

12:21.524 --> 12:24.615
Down a bit. Down.

12:24.652 --> 12:26.557
Uh, to your left.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.783
-That's about it.
-ls the cat in?

12:34.707 --> 12:36.199
He is now.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.991
Smile.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.871
A blind photographer.

13:10.907 --> 13:13.967
Now, that--that goes down
as weird sight of the week.

13:15.056 --> 13:17.026
Don't get me wrong about it.

13:17.067 --> 13:18.950
I mean, it's good you do
something creative, you know?

13:18.983 --> 13:20.506
Handicapped people
shouldn't sit around...

13:20.547 --> 13:22.745
feeling sorry for themselves.
They should have a hobby.

13:22.781 --> 13:25.840
My mother gave me a camera
when I was a boy.

13:25.878 --> 13:28.718
-Were you blind then?
-Yes.

13:28.751 --> 13:31.591
Well, why did she give you
a camera?

13:31.623 --> 13:34.964
-Sort of cruel, isn't it?
-I wanted a camera.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.815
Why?

13:37.849 --> 13:40.710
I thought
it would help me to see.

13:46.979 --> 13:48.317
Seventeen, right?

13:53.809 --> 13:55.017
Hey, Martin.

13:57.417 --> 14:00.311
-See you around.
-So to speak.

14:01.726 --> 14:02.835
Yeah.

14:34.478 --> 14:36.642
Remember the blind man
from the other night?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.584
He's here to see you.

14:44.277 --> 14:46.541
-G'day.
-Andy.

14:46.575 --> 14:49.503
Can't stay out here long.
I'm really quite busy.

14:49.546 --> 14:51.200
Thought you might like
to see these.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.335
Yeah.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.472
-Ha!
-Describe them to me.

15:01.515 --> 15:04.639
-What, each one?
-Each one.

15:04.675 --> 15:07.003
Keep it simple--under ten words.

15:07.037 --> 15:10.097
Um, look,
I don't have a lot of time.

15:10.135 --> 15:12.038
Then you better be quick.

15:16.678 --> 15:17.884
Um, right.

15:19.199 --> 15:21.103
Well, the first one
is me and the cat.

15:21.147 --> 15:24.455
They've all got the cat,
I suspect.

15:24.498 --> 15:25.902
Oh, yeah.

15:29.702 --> 15:31.901
I'll make it a bit easier
for you, Andy.

15:31.936 --> 15:34.831
Try five different ways
to describe how the cat looks.

15:39.278 --> 15:40.520
Dead.

15:44.066 --> 15:47.374
-Limp, sick.
-Limp.

15:47.417 --> 15:51.206
Andy holding limp cat
in waiting room of vet.

15:51.249 --> 15:53.632
Nine words. The photograph.

15:53.675 --> 15:56.319
-ls that the right way up?
-Yeah.

16:08.007 --> 16:09.792
What are you doing?

16:11.359 --> 16:13.242
I'm labeling it.

16:13.275 --> 16:16.018
-Why?
-Proof.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.694
Of what?

16:18.733 --> 16:22.814
That what's in the photograph
is what was there.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.365
That photograph
could be anywhere of anything.

16:25.405 --> 16:27.157
Except it isn't.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.479
I was there, Andy.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.970
I probably know more...

16:32.013 --> 16:35.354
about what was in that vet's
waiting room than you would.

16:38.908 --> 16:42.575
I know that there were
two fluorescent lights...

16:42.609 --> 16:45.637
because they have
a distinctive hum.

16:45.675 --> 16:49.560
The fluorescent light
directly above us was faulty...

16:49.602 --> 16:52.910
because it flickered on and off
intermittently.

16:52.953 --> 16:57.644
I know that the floor was
covered in old, worn linoleum...

16:57.677 --> 17:00.191
'cause I could feel it
through my shoes...

17:00.231 --> 17:02.137
and I heard footsteps on it.

17:02.178 --> 17:07.468
I can tell you that there was
a woman wearing high heels...

17:07.509 --> 17:08.912
and expensive perfume...

17:08.944 --> 17:13.507
and I could also smell
disinfectant and sick animals.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.839
And on you...

17:15.872 --> 17:18.320
a mixture of detergent
and garlic.

17:19.768 --> 17:25.699
But this is proof that
what I sensed is what you saw...

17:26.950 --> 17:29.246
through your eyes.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.206
The truth.

17:37.899 --> 17:40.739
Old bag holding hand
of small, ugly child.

17:40.772 --> 17:41.881
Yep.

17:45.848 --> 17:48.873
Ponces who think they're cool
playing cricket, wearing white.

17:48.911 --> 17:50.664
Yep.

17:50.699 --> 17:52.701
I like your style.

17:52.743 --> 17:57.967
It's simple, direct, honest.

18:02.064 --> 18:05.155
Andy, would you do this for me
on a regular basis?

18:05.192 --> 18:07.075
Do what?

18:07.107 --> 18:08.989
Describe my photographs.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.383
I could pay you.

18:11.415 --> 18:12.938
No way.

18:14.767 --> 18:18.534
Well, I understand.
It's a lot to ask.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.070
I mean, no money, OK?

18:25.909 --> 18:27.845
Andy, you must never lie to me.

18:29.005 --> 18:31.899
Why would I do that?

18:35.293 --> 18:37.231
Today is Wednesday.

18:37.272 --> 18:40.298
It is a sunny day outside.

18:42.475 --> 18:46.742
The grass is covered in
a layer of brown and yellow...

18:46.785 --> 18:49.146
and even
some dark red autumn leaves.

18:49.178 --> 18:51.409
There's a breeze blowing
some of the smaller leaves...

18:51.447 --> 18:53.481
into tiny spirals.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.852
-ls the man there?
-Yes.

18:57.894 --> 19:00.637
Over by the birdbath.

19:00.670 --> 19:03.054
He's raking the leaves.

19:04.246 --> 19:05.769
Can't you hear him?

19:08.812 --> 19:09.954
No.

19:12.163 --> 19:14.524
He stopped for the moment.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.440
I didn't hear him before.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.411
That's because
you weren't listening.

19:22.090 --> 19:24.734
-He's not there.
-Listen, Martin.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.655
You'll hear him soon enough.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.886
He's raking the leaves now.

19:28.922 --> 19:30.827
Listen for the rake.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.015
He was never there.

19:35.051 --> 19:38.653
-Why would I lie to you?
-Because you can.

20:03.876 --> 20:05.018
Hello, Martin.

20:15.686 --> 20:18.398
-What's that smell?
-I'm baking a cake.

20:18.432 --> 20:20.434
What's that gonna cost me?

20:27.177 --> 20:29.508
It's a special occasion.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.064
I turned thirty today.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.847
-Did you?
-Yes.

20:33.882 --> 20:36.015
And you know what they say.

20:36.052 --> 20:39.689
Once you're over 30, you can't
call yourself a girl anymore.

20:39.724 --> 20:42.084
You have to admit
to being a woman.

20:43.331 --> 20:46.833
But you wouldn't know
about that, Martin.

20:46.873 --> 20:47.919
You wouldn't know
about the difference...

20:47.959 --> 20:51.082
between a girl and a woman,
would you?

20:52.651 --> 20:54.589
Happy birthday, Celia.

20:56.163 --> 20:57.240
Thank you.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.372
And why have you come here
to my place...

21:00.408 --> 21:03.749
to bake a cake and visit me
on your birthday?

21:03.792 --> 21:07.361
I want you to take a photograph
of me.

21:12.285 --> 21:14.644
I bought myself
a birthday present.

21:14.677 --> 21:16.646
I'm wearing it.

21:16.687 --> 21:21.726
I thought maybe you could take
a photo of me in my new blouse.

21:25.627 --> 21:27.987
Have you ever touched satin,
Martin?

21:28.021 --> 21:30.600
It's soft.

21:30.638 --> 21:32.609
Softer than skin.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.518
Would you like to touch it?

21:51.451 --> 21:52.942
You don't get a birthday present
from me, Celia.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.837
You enjoy humiliating me.

21:56.877 --> 21:59.141
I won't be here forever.

21:59.175 --> 22:01.026
I can leave whenever I like.

22:01.059 --> 22:03.356
I can hurt you whenever I like.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.597
Don't flatter yourself.

22:08.497 --> 22:11.524
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

23:00.497 --> 23:01.607
Bill?

23:04.041 --> 23:05.466
Where are you?

23:11.861 --> 23:13.102
Bill?

23:16.586 --> 23:17.695
Bill?

23:20.512 --> 23:21.785
Bill!

23:26.098 --> 23:27.241
Here, Bill.

23:32.673 --> 23:34.643
A photo of a leaf.

23:34.686 --> 23:36.591
The light.
What's the light like?

23:36.632 --> 23:38.700
-Bright.
-Bright?

23:38.739 --> 23:42.114
Hot--you know, like
it was taken on a hot day...

23:42.154 --> 23:43.840
when the sun was directly above.

23:43.877 --> 23:45.283
-Midday. Am I right?
-Yes.

23:45.316 --> 23:47.034
Another.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.890
-A woman.
-A woman?

24:00.445 --> 24:02.034
Describe her to me.

24:05.681 --> 24:08.010
She's plain-looking.

24:08.043 --> 24:10.971
Brown hair. Blue eyes, I think.

24:13.565 --> 24:15.383
She's OK-looking.

24:15.417 --> 24:18.225
She's not a bag then, Andy?

24:18.259 --> 24:20.260
No, not a bag.

24:20.301 --> 24:22.184
Is she your sweetheart, Martin?

24:22.216 --> 24:23.937
Hell, no. Sweetheart?

24:23.973 --> 24:26.007
Celia has no heart.

24:26.047 --> 24:30.293
Celia is my housekeeper.
A vile woman. I hate her.

24:39.837 --> 24:42.384
If you hate her so much,
why do you keep her on?

24:42.423 --> 24:44.393
She wants me.

24:44.434 --> 24:47.688
And I know that if I continue
to deny her what she wants...

24:47.722 --> 24:49.146
she can never feel pity for me.

24:49.189 --> 24:53.303
Instead, I can pity her. Next.

24:53.339 --> 24:56.332
Have you ever had moving
pictures described to you?

24:56.372 --> 24:58.223
-What, the cinema?
-Yeah.

24:58.255 --> 25:00.932
No. I hate crowds.

25:00.970 --> 25:03.995
That's all right.
We'll stay in the car.

25:04.162 --> 25:07.153
Chip won't get away from me
at the dance next week.

25:07.193 --> 25:08.782
He's sex-crazy.

25:08.821 --> 25:11.597
She's taking off her clothes.
Beautiful.

25:11.631 --> 25:13.513
Perfect skin.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.539
-Hi, Michelle.
-Hi, Linda.

25:17.568 --> 25:20.463
Nice tits, mate.
Little ones with perky nipples.

25:20.505 --> 25:22.671
Cute in her white knickers.
She's gonna die for sure.

25:22.707 --> 25:25.068
-Where's her friend Candy?
-ln the fridge, remember?

25:25.995 --> 25:27.551
-Uh-oh.
-What?

25:27.590 --> 25:29.529
Shadow on the door.
Really nasty-looking shadow.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.453
You know,
if you analyze your feelings...

25:31.487 --> 25:33.303
you really do want the killer
to get the girl.

25:33.337 --> 25:34.544
-Shit!
-What?

25:34.582 --> 25:36.487
He's at the window again.
She hasn't even seen him.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.413
-ls she blind?
-No, just stupid.

25:38.445 --> 25:40.383
Let us in.

25:40.425 --> 25:41.500
There's the shadow again.

25:41.541 --> 25:44.632
Whoa. Big close-up of an eye--
bloodshot, ugly.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.390
The fat pig in the white coat...

25:46.425 --> 25:48.330
is running after that
blonde chick with a scalpel.

25:48.373 --> 25:50.822
She hasn't seen him yet.
She has now.

25:50.863 --> 25:54.433
She's off down the corridor--
that circular staircase.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.157
She's falling over. She's...

26:03.854 --> 26:05.605
Blood all over the door, mate.

26:05.641 --> 26:06.720
Strangulation, mutilation.

26:23.773 --> 26:27.855
What sort of food do you reckon
would be good for blind people?

29:00.061 --> 29:01.998
Look at this jerk, huh?

29:05.806 --> 29:08.190
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, mate?

29:09.988 --> 29:12.438
You're a bloody perv,
aren't you, mate?

29:12.479 --> 29:13.786
Are you addressing me?

29:13.819 --> 29:16.148
-Undressing you?
-Undressing you?

29:16.182 --> 29:19.947
What do you reckon this is,
poofter heaven or something?

29:19.980 --> 29:21.831
Perv on this, faggot.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.745
Andy?

29:32.780 --> 29:34.435
Andy?

29:34.472 --> 29:36.833
Andy!

29:36.866 --> 29:39.164
-Andy!
-Andy!

29:39.198 --> 29:40.852
Hey!

29:44.432 --> 29:46.151
Andy, what's happening?

29:46.188 --> 29:48.093
Stay in the car, Martin.
Lock the doors.

29:48.135 --> 29:51.127
Car? Is that what you call
this heap of shit?

29:51.167 --> 29:54.257
-Ha ha ha.
-Get off the car, please.

29:56.083 --> 29:59.304
-I reckon you two are faggots.
-Fuck off. He's a blind man.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.417
Just leave him alone, all right?

30:00.457 --> 30:01.566
Throw us your lippy, Jean.

30:04.830 --> 30:05.907
Mate...

30:05.948 --> 30:09.616
-Hey, excuse me.
-"Excuse me, excuse me."

30:14.598 --> 30:15.935
You bastard.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.710
Don't start this, all right?

30:21.587 --> 30:22.698
Andy?

30:26.664 --> 30:29.178
Go on. Go on. Beat him again!

30:29.217 --> 30:31.895
Come on! Hit him!

30:33.080 --> 30:36.235
Help! Help!

30:49.169 --> 30:50.985
Passenger door, man!
Passenger door!

30:51.021 --> 30:53.828
Quick! Let me in the car!
Come back!

30:53.862 --> 30:55.515
Get the door!

30:55.553 --> 30:59.405
Move over, move over.
Get your feet off the pedals.

31:15.983 --> 31:18.911
Oh, great. Just what I need--
the bloody police.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.897
Put your hands on the wheel.

31:23.931 --> 31:26.346
-Hey, pull over!
-Nod.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.816
Get your feet away
from the brake.

31:34.879 --> 31:37.110
Oh, fuck. I'm bleeding.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.387
-Are you hurt?
-Whoa!

31:40.307 --> 31:41.417
Shit!

31:43.532 --> 31:45.251
Bloody beauty.

31:47.138 --> 31:49.815
That's it. We're going down.

31:49.852 --> 31:52.399
My eyes. I can't see!

31:52.438 --> 31:54.189
I can't see!

31:56.874 --> 31:59.421
I think he hit his head
on the steering wheel.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.528
I think
it's dislodged his brain.

32:07.345 --> 32:08.618
Thanks, nurse.

32:16.443 --> 32:17.868
Now, Andy...

32:19.667 --> 32:21.070
well, I've got, uh...

32:21.102 --> 32:23.964
I've got bad news, actually.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.206
Your friend Martin is--

32:26.242 --> 32:27.831
Well, the doctors
are still looking at him,...

32:27.870 --> 32:31.821
but it looks like
he's been blinded.

32:31.860 --> 32:33.230
Blinded?

32:37.798 --> 32:38.972
Shit.

32:45.874 --> 32:47.299
You'll be all right?

32:48.332 --> 32:50.270
Yes.

32:50.311 --> 32:51.486
Thank you.

32:53.535 --> 32:54.645
Sir.

32:55.673 --> 32:56.946
Brian.

33:01.323 --> 33:02.531
Brian.

33:22.903 --> 33:25.613
You've been blind all your life.

33:25.649 --> 33:27.912
I know.

33:27.946 --> 33:30.307
What were you doing
driving a car?

33:32.033 --> 33:33.457
I forgot.

33:53.357 --> 33:54.781
"l forgot."

34:07.976 --> 34:09.217
B-Brian.

34:23.139 --> 34:26.706
They're blue. Your eyes.

34:26.745 --> 34:28.496
Yes.

34:29.842 --> 34:31.527
Why do you hide them?

34:31.565 --> 34:34.243
Well, they're not real eyes,
just defective tissue.

34:34.279 --> 34:36.130
Look into my eyes,
but they won't look back.

34:39.226 --> 34:41.231
What color are your eyes?

34:41.271 --> 34:42.608
Green.

34:42.641 --> 34:44.873
Blue's better than green.

34:53.368 --> 34:56.045
Would you like to come in...

34:56.081 --> 34:57.571
for some tea?

34:57.613 --> 34:59.943
Or some port?

34:59.976 --> 35:01.467
Yeah, I would.

35:10.702 --> 35:13.063
How do you know when to stop?

35:13.096 --> 35:14.978
The sound.

35:18.012 --> 35:20.144
Fucking amazing.

35:20.182 --> 35:22.794
There you are.

35:23.821 --> 35:24.932
Thanks.

35:31.451 --> 35:33.333
Who's that in the photograph?

35:33.366 --> 35:34.858
Which photograph?

35:34.898 --> 35:36.900
The old one on the mantelpiece.

35:36.941 --> 35:39.455
Oh. How'd you know it's old?

35:39.494 --> 35:42.423
Looks old.
It's black and white.

35:42.464 --> 35:45.075
The lady in it has got
old-fashioned clothes on.

35:45.113 --> 35:48.139
-ls that your mum?
-Yes.

35:48.178 --> 35:50.277
Is the kid you?

35:50.316 --> 35:52.165
I always supposed so.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.497
You've never seen your own mum?

35:57.339 --> 36:00.843
Do you want me
to describe her to you?

36:00.882 --> 36:02.057
All right.

36:05.224 --> 36:07.008
She doesn't look like you.

36:07.043 --> 36:10.168
Oh, really?
People always said she did.

36:10.204 --> 36:11.607
Nah. They were probably
just saying that.

36:17.481 --> 36:21.333
Looks like the two of you
are in a park.

36:21.376 --> 36:24.151
You're sitting down.
She's got her arms around you.

36:24.184 --> 36:26.067
You're sort of looking away.

36:29.772 --> 36:34.017
She's got long white fingers
like a statue, you know?

36:36.697 --> 36:40.170
She looks young.
Maybe twenty-eight, twenty-nine?

36:44.009 --> 36:47.676
With long, dark hair that's
falling around her shoulders.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.010
She's very pale.

36:56.107 --> 36:57.629
And you--

36:57.671 --> 37:00.533
you're covered with freckles,
and your hair is short.

37:00.575 --> 37:02.457
She always cut it herself.

37:02.491 --> 37:05.450
I never went to a barber.

37:05.492 --> 37:07.906
I never went out
with my mother at all.

37:07.948 --> 37:11.203
She was embarrassed by me,
you see?

37:11.237 --> 37:13.947
She always wanted
an ordinary child...

37:13.982 --> 37:16.398
that she could do
ordinary things with...

37:16.440 --> 37:19.694
only she got me.

37:25.187 --> 37:27.516
Thank you.

37:28.731 --> 37:31.407
One day,
I might show you a photograph.

37:33.327 --> 37:36.702
It was the first one
I ever took. I was ten.

37:36.743 --> 37:39.038
It's not much of a photograph,
really.

37:39.073 --> 37:41.588
It's just a garden...

37:41.626 --> 37:46.632
that was visible through one
of the windows in our flat...

37:46.669 --> 37:50.273
but it's the most important
photograph I've ever taken.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.994
Every morning
and every afternoon...

37:55.034 --> 37:59.082
my mother would describe
this garden to me.

37:59.119 --> 38:05.247
I saw the seasons come and go
through her eyes.

38:05.281 --> 38:07.185
I used to question her
so thoroughly...

38:07.227 --> 38:09.610
always trying
to catch her in a lie.

38:09.653 --> 38:11.591
I never did.

38:11.633 --> 38:16.226
But by taking the photo,
I knew that I could--one day.

38:23.923 --> 38:26.185
Why would your mother
lie to you?

38:26.221 --> 38:28.256
To punish me...

38:28.297 --> 38:29.886
for being blind.

38:38.479 --> 38:42.778
Does it really matter if she
lied to you about some garden?

38:42.820 --> 38:44.442
Yes.

38:47.002 --> 38:48.852
It was my world.

40:48.016 --> 40:49.801
Is Martin in?

40:54.720 --> 40:55.960
No.

40:58.072 --> 41:00.008
You sure?

41:00.050 --> 41:02.118
Yes.

41:02.157 --> 41:04.159
Do you know
when he's going to be back?

41:07.168 --> 41:08.508
No.

41:17.416 --> 41:18.722
You must be Celia.

41:19.684 --> 41:21.337
Why must I be Celia?

41:21.374 --> 41:24.433
I've seen your photograph.

41:27.758 --> 41:30.054
You look different in the flesh.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.198
Different?

41:31.237 --> 41:34.198
You mean I photograph well
and look bad in the flesh?

41:34.239 --> 41:39.212
No. No, you come up well
in both, photograph and flesh.

41:40.592 --> 41:44.193
So do you.
Perhaps the camera loves us.

41:44.231 --> 41:48.312
Can't be Martin. Doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

41:49.528 --> 41:52.010
He's in the park,
walking the fleabag.

42:05.457 --> 42:07.786
Oh, my God.

42:53.819 --> 42:55.061
Bill.

43:00.522 --> 43:02.307
Bill!

43:03.491 --> 43:05.112
Bill!

43:36.242 --> 43:38.985
There you are, eh?
Where have you been?

43:39.019 --> 43:40.608
Come on.

43:52.841 --> 43:53.951
Thank you.

44:14.932 --> 44:16.390
Where do I find that?

44:16.432 --> 44:18.250
On the bottom there
on the right.

44:20.134 --> 44:22.517
Look who's all spruced up.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.064
This is a friend of mine, Celia.
His name's Andy.

44:26.104 --> 44:27.507
And we're going out.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.292
Andy, this is Celia.

44:29.328 --> 44:32.419
She'll make you a cup of tea
if you'd like one.

44:32.457 --> 44:33.978
No, thanks.

44:39.543 --> 44:41.741
I was going past the chemist,
Martin...

44:41.778 --> 44:43.267
so I picked up your photographs.

44:43.310 --> 44:47.076
You give them to me now,
and never do that again.

44:49.629 --> 44:51.001
Such gratitude.

44:57.993 --> 45:00.061
I'd like you to take a look...

45:00.100 --> 45:01.820
at this latest set
of photographs, Andy.

45:01.857 --> 45:04.153
Every time
I visit the park with Bill...

45:04.186 --> 45:07.407
he mysteriously disappears for
periods of up to five minutes.

45:07.442 --> 45:09.641
It's very disturbing for me
because...

45:09.676 --> 45:11.427
I don't know where he's gone to.

45:11.464 --> 45:14.587
But now I think
I may have finally detected...

45:14.624 --> 45:17.399
the reason
for his disappearances.

45:20.594 --> 45:21.703
Andy?

45:28.286 --> 45:29.712
What do you see?

45:31.416 --> 45:33.102
Nothing.

45:33.139 --> 45:35.141
Oh, come on, Andy,
you can do better than that.

45:36.682 --> 45:38.783
Can you see Bill anywhere?

45:38.821 --> 45:41.020
Yes, I see Bill.

45:41.056 --> 45:42.645
What's he doing?

45:45.398 --> 45:47.302
Who's he with?
Is he with anyone?

45:51.270 --> 45:52.544
Yes.

45:52.579 --> 45:54.842
Yes, who? Who is it?

45:54.877 --> 45:57.458
I mean, no.
He's not with anyone.

45:57.496 --> 46:00.042
He's--he's with another dog.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.114
Celia, turn that machine off!

46:04.742 --> 46:07.102
-There's another dog?
-Yes.

46:08.508 --> 46:10.478
What kind?

46:12.275 --> 46:15.050
Young. Um, a puppy.

46:15.085 --> 46:17.826
-Brown.
-A dog.

46:18.978 --> 46:20.862
Are you sure?

46:20.894 --> 46:23.757
Of course I'm sure. It's a dog.

46:24.852 --> 46:26.538
It's probably a bitch.

46:26.576 --> 46:30.757
You know, a bitch on heat.

46:33.343 --> 46:35.249
Andy, what do you think?

46:36.217 --> 46:39.786
Yes, l--I think it is.

46:43.143 --> 46:45.755
-So, was I right?
-About what?

46:45.793 --> 46:47.316
Celia.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.287
She's one of a kind.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.576
Yeah, it's like a rare disease.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.238
Celia?

47:28.344 --> 47:31.979
I have you
in the palm of my hand.

47:34.633 --> 47:37.147
Think where I could display
this photograph.

47:37.187 --> 47:40.277
On an item of clothing, perhaps.

47:40.314 --> 47:43.155
Jumper? Coat?

47:43.187 --> 47:45.570
You'll always have to check.

47:47.912 --> 47:50.361
Or maybe a public notice board.

47:52.285 --> 47:54.287
You'd never know.

47:54.328 --> 47:57.549
And people would begin
to talk to you strangely...

47:57.583 --> 48:00.739
in a tone of voice that says...

48:00.775 --> 48:04.183
"I've seen you
with your trousers down."

48:05.278 --> 48:06.584
What do you want?

48:08.404 --> 48:12.008
We're talking right now
or long-term?

48:13.161 --> 48:14.586
What do you want for the photo?

48:15.747 --> 48:17.151
Money?

48:20.535 --> 48:23.692
I want your company
for one night.

48:29.632 --> 48:31.450
Such vivid colors.

48:33.815 --> 48:36.807
Your underpants are so red.

49:02.193 --> 49:04.554
Why don't you tell me
where we are?

49:04.588 --> 49:05.991
It's a surprise.

49:06.023 --> 49:07.546
You'll love it.

49:09.088 --> 49:11.318
You'll wish you'd brought
your camera with you.

49:11.355 --> 49:13.390
Then you could've
taken a photograph...

49:13.429 --> 49:15.181
and shown it
to your little friend...

49:15.217 --> 49:16.903
the one
who describes things to you.

49:16.940 --> 49:18.431
You leave Andy out of this.

49:49.309 --> 49:51.572
Dear Lord.

51:30.435 --> 51:31.677
Celia?

51:34.746 --> 51:36.630
I'd like to thank you.

51:36.662 --> 51:39.502
That was an experience
I shall never forget.

51:39.534 --> 51:41.439
I'm glad, Martin.

51:43.843 --> 51:44.953
Celia?

51:46.046 --> 51:47.156
Yes?

51:48.631 --> 51:50.831
May l...

51:50.867 --> 51:52.750
have the photograph?

51:54.059 --> 51:57.399
No. The night's not over yet.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.581
I prepared a light supper.

52:16.339 --> 52:17.765
Will this take long?

52:20.489 --> 52:22.210
You can sit over here.

52:53.177 --> 52:55.691
I'm a bit of a photographer
myself, Martin.

52:55.731 --> 52:58.984
Really? What do you photograph?

53:00.807 --> 53:02.264
Things I love.

53:03.679 --> 53:07.283
I don't think you realize
how fond I am of you.

53:07.319 --> 53:09.734
I'm getting a fair idea.

53:33.846 --> 53:35.151
Your favorite.

53:52.519 --> 53:54.238
Your favorite cold meats.

53:58.137 --> 54:00.336
For so long,
I've wanted you in my house...

54:00.371 --> 54:03.082
and now you're here.

54:03.118 --> 54:05.055
I would have preferred
to begin the night...

54:05.097 --> 54:07.425
without the photograph,
but it was clear...

54:07.458 --> 54:09.940
you wouldn't ask me out
of your own volition.

54:11.608 --> 54:13.969
But the photo
doesn't matter anymore.

54:14.003 --> 54:17.671
Tonight's been
all I've hoped for and more.

54:20.227 --> 54:22.642
Hopefully...more.

54:27.058 --> 54:29.866
Is supper self-serve?

54:32.134 --> 54:36.531
I never knew my father, and
my mother died ten years ago.

54:37.784 --> 54:39.786
So now there's only me.

54:41.295 --> 54:42.535
And you.

54:48.318 --> 54:50.832
You and l
have a lot in common--

54:50.871 --> 54:53.037
both motherless, both alone.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.368
Do you ever get the feeling
of being watched?

54:58.405 --> 55:00.059
All my life.

55:04.406 --> 55:06.920
And you never knew
when it was me?

55:10.247 --> 55:12.545
Celia,
why don't we get to the point?

55:14.972 --> 55:16.658
Have you ever wondered...

55:16.697 --> 55:18.796
why I've stayed working for you
all these years...

55:18.835 --> 55:21.285
when you're
so deliberately cruel to me?

55:21.325 --> 55:22.750
I have asked myself
that question.

55:22.793 --> 55:23.902
And what was the answer?

55:25.123 --> 55:27.834
-That you like it?
-I don't like it. I hate it.

55:27.868 --> 55:30.067
-Ask the question again.
-What question?

55:30.103 --> 55:32.714
-Why do I stay with you?
-I don't know.

55:32.752 --> 55:34.243
Yes, you do, Martin.

55:34.284 --> 55:39.128
No more game playing.
Games are over. Time for truth.

55:39.168 --> 55:41.529
All right, Celia.
I know why you stay.

55:44.244 --> 55:46.474
Can I ask you something?

55:46.510 --> 55:48.676
Yes.

55:48.714 --> 55:50.879
I get the feeling
you've never been with a woman.

55:50.915 --> 55:52.636
Am I right?

55:52.672 --> 55:54.934
I think we're getting
a little personal here.

55:54.970 --> 55:58.889
You're 32 years old, Martin.
Isn't it time we did?

55:58.928 --> 56:01.095
There's no need to be afraid.

56:02.791 --> 56:05.053
Have you ever touched a woman?

56:08.536 --> 56:10.190
Feel this.

56:10.228 --> 56:12.111
Feel it thumping in there?

56:12.143 --> 56:16.640
It's beating fast--
faster than usual.

56:16.677 --> 56:18.396
That's where the music
got you, isn't it?

56:18.433 --> 56:20.435
That's where you get me.

56:33.690 --> 56:36.499
I'm greedy, Martin.
I want you all to myself.

56:36.532 --> 56:38.022
I used to have that,
but things have changed.

56:38.065 --> 56:39.686
I have to change them back.

56:39.724 --> 56:42.880
Take this opportunity, Martin.
It may never come again.

57:06.762 --> 57:08.861
No. I can't.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.391
-Trust me.
-I can't.

57:10.431 --> 57:11.639
Don't be scared.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.496
-I'm not scared.
-you want me.

57:13.530 --> 57:16.172
I don't. I don't want anyone.

57:16.209 --> 57:17.962
Just leave me alone!

57:19.275 --> 57:20.645
Don't go. Don't leave me.

57:22.467 --> 57:24.089
Your fly's undone!

57:37.565 --> 57:39.122
Where am l?

57:42.354 --> 57:43.561
Taxi!

57:45.578 --> 57:46.883
Taxi!

57:56.304 --> 57:59.295
Get in, Martin.
I'll drive you home.

58:33.780 --> 58:36.523
I do everything for you, Martin.

58:36.558 --> 58:38.374
I wash your clothes.

58:38.409 --> 58:41.630
I put your favorite ones
where you can find them.

58:41.665 --> 58:43.797
I cook for you.

58:43.835 --> 58:45.424
I watch your budget.

58:45.463 --> 58:48.587
I pay your bills on time,
do your grocery shopping.

58:48.623 --> 58:51.910
I'm like a wife to you,
but you don't trust me.

58:54.944 --> 58:58.132
I want your trust.
I want your respect.

58:59.284 --> 59:00.972
I'm the only one you can trust.

59:01.009 --> 59:02.315
I'm the only one
who'll look after you.

59:02.349 --> 59:03.459
You're not the only one.

59:06.945 --> 59:08.980
Andy?

59:09.021 --> 59:12.690
You can't trust him.
You'll find that out.

59:12.724 --> 59:15.913
Are you going to fire me?

59:15.948 --> 59:19.235
You don't have to think
about it. Are you firing me?

59:19.267 --> 59:20.954
I would have thought
you might want to leave.

59:25.748 --> 59:27.500
Do you want to resign, Celia?

59:31.621 --> 59:33.144
No.

59:35.802 --> 59:39.372
I was right. You do enjoy it.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.957
What about you, Martin?

59:41.996 --> 59:43.714
Do you enjoy it?

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.249
I'm going to die, Martin.

01:00:51.393 --> 01:00:53.079
Do you know what that means?

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:57.483
When?

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.104
Soon.

01:01:01.607 --> 01:01:03.491
Before, I'll be very sick...

01:01:03.523 --> 01:01:06.005
and I won't be able
to look after you.

01:01:06.045 --> 01:01:09.233
I won't be able to describe
your garden to you anymore...

01:01:09.269 --> 01:01:13.537
and you'll have to go and live
with grandma for a while.

01:01:13.578 --> 01:01:16.418
You don't want
to see me anymore.

01:01:16.451 --> 01:01:20.239
No, that's not true.
I want to stay here with you.

01:01:20.282 --> 01:01:22.219
I don't want to leave you.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:23.599
But you are.

01:01:23.634 --> 01:01:26.148
You're just saying you're going
to die to get away from me.

01:01:26.187 --> 01:01:27.907
You're ashamed of me.

01:01:27.943 --> 01:01:29.661
Please, Martin.
I'm telling you the truth.

01:01:29.697 --> 01:01:31.037
You're not telling the truth.

01:01:31.072 --> 01:01:34.195
You never do.
I'll never believe you.

01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:09.215
It's hollow.

01:02:34.691 --> 01:02:35.866
Martin?

01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:45.118
Martin, you there?

01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:51.127
Hello, Andy.

01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:57.668
Hi.

01:02:59.557 --> 01:03:02.398
This room only gets light
in the mornings.

01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:04.465
It seems a shame to waste it.

01:03:04.505 --> 01:03:06.889
Martin doesn't notice,
of course.

01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:14.968
Where is Martin?

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:18.740
He's at the library
for the blind.

01:03:20.434 --> 01:03:22.088
Be gone for hours.

01:03:24.488 --> 01:03:28.341
That's right.
You can go look in his bedroom.

01:03:28.383 --> 01:03:30.614
I won't tell him if you want to.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.131
Don't you want to?
Haven't you ever wondered...

01:03:33.171 --> 01:03:35.882
what blind people's bedrooms
are like?

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:38.811
-No.
-Bet you have.

01:03:38.853 --> 01:03:40.920
He's got dirty books in there.

01:03:40.959 --> 01:03:44.269
No pictures, of course,
but they're dirty.

01:03:44.313 --> 01:03:46.672
All in braille.

01:03:46.706 --> 01:03:47.946
Bullshit.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.671
Yes.

01:03:52.707 --> 01:03:56.276
Still, makes you wonder
what someone like Martin does...

01:03:56.313 --> 01:03:58.033
for entertainment, doesn't it?

01:03:59.889 --> 01:04:01.772
He's got so many books.

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.687
Bet some of them are dirty.

01:04:03.719 --> 01:04:06.876
He's read many more books
than me, and I can see.

01:04:09.849 --> 01:04:13.702
Well, that's what he does for
entertainment, then, isn't it?

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.954
He hates me.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:34.290
I didn't think he was capable
of not hating anything...

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:39.373
except for his dog,
his photographs.

01:04:42.696 --> 01:04:44.481
I think he loves you.

01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:51.208
And you lied to him
about the photograph.

01:04:54.794 --> 01:04:57.308
You lied for me.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.151
Is that what you think?

01:05:01.722 --> 01:05:04.431
I just didn't want him
to get hurt.

01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:10.648
You lied for me.

01:05:14.489 --> 01:05:15.860
In case.

01:05:22.694 --> 01:05:24.315
In case of what?

01:05:33.771 --> 01:05:36.066
Let's pretend we're blind.

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:06.069
Martin?

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:16.123
What are you doing here?

01:06:19.003 --> 01:06:21.332
I was just in the area.

01:06:22.993 --> 01:06:24.877
Saw you sitting over here.

01:06:24.909 --> 01:06:27.139
Thought I might come
and say hello.

01:06:32.091 --> 01:06:33.811
I must have photographed
everything...

01:06:33.847 --> 01:06:38.092
in this park by now--
every tree and every bench.

01:06:38.124 --> 01:06:39.811
What's left?

01:06:41.317 --> 01:06:43.699
There's a leaf at your feet.

01:06:43.743 --> 01:06:45.908
How large?

01:06:45.945 --> 01:06:47.534
You'll have to photograph it.

01:06:47.574 --> 01:06:50.088
Then I'll describe it
to you later.

01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:01.008
What?

01:07:01.043 --> 01:07:02.763
I just took a photo of a leaf...

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.229
because you told me there was
one there, and I believed you.

01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:09.271
I trust you, Andy.

01:07:11.578 --> 01:07:14.190
-Well, maybe you shouldn't.
-Why not?

01:07:16.015 --> 01:07:18.344
There is a leaf, isn't there?

01:07:18.378 --> 01:07:19.551
Yeah.

01:07:22.528 --> 01:07:24.910
I'm not good at responsibility,
Martin.

01:07:27.219 --> 01:07:28.623
Never have been.

01:07:28.655 --> 01:07:33.151
All my bosses have always said
I've got an untrustworthy face.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.539
My parents think I'm useless--

01:07:36.573 --> 01:07:39.413
always changing jobs,
moving around.

01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:48.404
I'm a black sheep, Martin.

01:07:50.427 --> 01:07:53.267
If you could see me,
you might agree.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:20.781
Celia, what have you done
with Bill's leash?

01:08:20.817 --> 01:08:23.679
It's here.
I've attached it for you.

01:08:29.179 --> 01:08:31.062
There are changes to be made.

01:08:31.094 --> 01:08:33.129
You will no longer
hide things from me.

01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:35.203
Do you understand?

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.443
Yes, Martin.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:38.881
Truth is best.

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:42.895
Come, Bill.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.312
Oh, I love labradors.

01:08:56.345 --> 01:08:58.794
And I'm not just saying that,
Bill.

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:01.761
They're great friends to man,
eh, Martin?

01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:02.944
Yes.

01:09:02.983 --> 01:09:05.694
So, just
the annual parvo shot, then?

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.819
-Yes.
-All right.

01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:12.138
Here we go, Bill.

01:09:12.176 --> 01:09:15.038
There you are.
Didn't even flinch.

01:09:18.274 --> 01:09:21.115
What's this you got
stuck under your collar, eh?

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:23.823
-What?
-It's a photograph.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.636
Oh. It's not me on the toilet,
is it?

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:29.696
No. No, it's of Bill.

01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:32.411
Very photogenic, too,
if I may say so.

01:09:32.447 --> 01:09:36.212
-Bill in the park?
-Yes.

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:45.116
Bill with brown dog in the park.

01:09:45.151 --> 01:09:47.033
No.

01:09:47.067 --> 01:09:50.375
Bill
with a woman and your friend.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:51.595
My friend?

01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:55.899
The one you brought with you
when you came with the cat.

01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:57.464
Andy?

01:10:38.046 --> 01:10:39.254
Who's there?

01:10:40.248 --> 01:10:41.837
Only me, Martin.

01:10:49.347 --> 01:10:51.229
Why are you still here?

01:10:51.262 --> 01:10:53.330
You should've finished
your chores two hours ago.

01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:59.711
Who else is here?

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.830
Who do you think is here?

01:11:23.631 --> 01:11:24.969
It's me.

01:11:30.972 --> 01:11:33.834
I know I should have
told you this before.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.666
Celia and I are in love.

01:11:44.858 --> 01:11:46.261
In love?

01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:48.748
Yes.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:12.332
Get out, both of you.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:22.268
How many times do I have
to tell you? Get out!

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:50.669
Take a seat.
I'll make us a cup of tea.

01:14:35.894 --> 01:14:38.221
He won't forgive you.

01:14:38.254 --> 01:14:40.040
Not now.

01:15:02.517 --> 01:15:04.933
Nancy Pamela Webber.

01:15:04.975 --> 01:15:07.586
Could you lead me
to the headstone, please?

01:15:43.471 --> 01:15:47.236
Do you ever get cases of
an empty coffin being buried?

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:50.644
Why would anyone
want to do that?

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:53.906
I don't know. A hoax?

01:15:53.941 --> 01:15:57.228
Pretty expensive sort of hoax,
if you ask me.

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:16.092
I had to buy some polish
for the table, Martin...

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:18.031
so you owe me an extra $5.00.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.990
Celia.

01:16:35.568 --> 01:16:37.831
I'm sorry I tormented you
for so long.

01:16:37.865 --> 01:16:40.129
You're sorry?

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:41.818
I knew how you felt about me...

01:16:41.856 --> 01:16:44.119
and it was wrong of me
to exploit your feelings.

01:16:46.579 --> 01:16:48.103
You're fired.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.773
May I have my key, please?

01:16:57.114 --> 01:16:59.660
The key to my house.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:01.125
You're being ridiculous.

01:17:01.169 --> 01:17:03.018
Not anymore.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:24.751
I don't want you
to worry about me, Celia.

01:17:24.789 --> 01:17:26.988
I've arranged
for another cleaning woman...

01:17:27.024 --> 01:17:28.364
through the agency.

01:17:28.396 --> 01:17:30.399
A cleaning woman.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.345
I've written you a reference.

01:17:36.314 --> 01:17:39.154
"Celia was in my employment
for 3 1/2 years.

01:17:39.186 --> 01:17:41.995
"She proved herself to be
an efficient housekeeper...

01:17:42.028 --> 01:17:45.597
"and a lively and provocative
conversationalist.

01:17:45.635 --> 01:17:47.898
I heartily recommend
her services."

01:17:51.509 --> 01:17:53.707
You didn't mention my breasts.

01:17:55.914 --> 01:17:58.689
"Celia has exceptional breasts."

01:18:01.948 --> 01:18:03.503
Would you like me to add that?

01:18:07.213 --> 01:18:09.216
Do I get a kiss good-bye?

01:18:09.258 --> 01:18:10.628
No.

01:18:11.779 --> 01:18:15.316
You don't have to kiss me.
I'll kiss you.

01:18:32.463 --> 01:18:35.239
-Bill won't miss me?
-I should think he would.

01:18:35.273 --> 01:18:36.795
I'm glad.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:40.987
Whenever you call him
and he doesn't come...

01:18:41.019 --> 01:18:42.508
you'll think of me.

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.666
Good-bye, Celia.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.743
G'day.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.332
Andy.

01:19:42.371 --> 01:19:44.341
How you doing?

01:19:53.066 --> 01:19:55.427
Would you like to come in?

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.822
No, thanks. I can't stay long.

01:19:57.854 --> 01:19:59.475
I'm working two shifts.

01:19:59.514 --> 01:20:02.191
Need the extra money.

01:20:02.227 --> 01:20:04.555
I'm gonna start up
a mail-order business.

01:20:07.143 --> 01:20:09.853
I met this bloke who made
fifteen grand in six months...

01:20:09.887 --> 01:20:11.226
just by selling things
through the mail.

01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:13.710
You should have taken care,
Andy.

01:20:13.751 --> 01:20:16.940
I'm a blind man.
I'm not like other people.

01:20:16.975 --> 01:20:19.968
You can't know how important
truth is to me.

01:20:20.008 --> 01:20:21.248
I do know.

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:25.430
Shit, Martin, everybody lies.

01:20:25.465 --> 01:20:29.100
But not all the time,
and that's the point.

01:20:31.499 --> 01:20:34.590
I lied to you about Celia...

01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:36.217
but nothing else.

01:20:37.437 --> 01:20:39.733
How can I believe you?

01:20:41.075 --> 01:20:42.729
You can't.

01:20:46.694 --> 01:20:48.576
You tell the truth, Martin.

01:20:48.609 --> 01:20:51.155
Your whole life's the truth.

01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:53.938
Have some pity
on the rest of us.

01:20:56.684 --> 01:20:57.892
Andy?

01:20:59.462 --> 01:21:01.944
If you could spare me
a few minutes.

01:21:01.984 --> 01:21:03.802
I know you're busy,
but I have a photograph...

01:21:03.836 --> 01:21:05.424
I'd like you to describe.

01:21:07.761 --> 01:21:10.655
It's the last one.

01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:36.257
It's a man in a garden.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:47.216
It's a sunny day.

01:21:48.876 --> 01:21:52.609
The man's dressed in overalls,
and he's holding a rake.

01:21:52.644 --> 01:21:55.484
Beside him is a wheelbarrow.
It's full of leaves.

01:21:55.517 --> 01:21:57.845
Must be autumn.

01:21:57.878 --> 01:22:00.491
There's a birdbath.
No birds in it, though.

01:22:04.581 --> 01:22:07.444
It's a small garden.

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:08.858
Very neat.

01:22:08.891 --> 01:22:12.232
The man with the rake
must look after it.

01:22:13.774 --> 01:22:19.064
Can't quite make out his face,
but he looks--he looks old.

01:22:20.543 --> 01:22:23.219
Old and...

01:22:23.255 --> 01:22:25.617
kind.

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:27.979
Kind?

01:22:29.895 --> 01:22:31.300
I don't know.

01:22:31.332 --> 01:22:33.399
Maybe it's just the photo.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.323
It's a nice photo, Martin.

01:22:38.355 --> 01:22:39.562
Keep it.

01:22:44.803 --> 01:22:46.708
You're sure you don't need it?

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.384
All right.

01:23:01.499 --> 01:23:02.674
Andy?

01:23:04.116 --> 01:23:07.425
I thought I might drop into
the restaurant tomorrow.

01:23:08.904 --> 01:23:10.460
Will you be there?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.589
Yeah, I'll be there.
