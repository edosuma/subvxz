Come on.

10:47.968 --> 10:50.167

10:51.367 --> 10:52.601

10:52.601 --> 10:53.601
What about now?

10:53.601 --> 10:54.868
I said no!

10:56.334 --> 10:59.267
God, what's your problem?

10:59.267 --> 11:00.968
I was just trying to
get you in the mood.

11:00.968 --> 11:03.267
Oh, this is supposed to be
a turn-on?

11:03.267 --> 11:05.834
You crawl into bed wasted
and slobber all over me?

11:05.834 --> 11:08.467
Oh, so it's okay
when you're buzzed too,

11:08.467 --> 11:11.033
but let me be a couple of drinks
ahead and all of a sudden

11:11.033 --> 11:13.634
you rediscover
your long-lost virginity?

11:14.534 --> 11:15.834
Huh?

I-I really didn't know Nick.

11:33.634 --> 11:35.968
But you must have seen him.

11:35.968 --> 11:39.834
I mean, like after concerts
or at parties or whatever.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.767
Briefly, maybe, but...

11:41.767 --> 11:43.467

must have talked.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.467
It was long time ago, Claudia.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.934

what you're doing.

bad things about your father?

bad things, Avery.

12:20.367 --> 12:24.467
I wanna think good things,

12:24.467 --> 12:26.968

whenever I remember him,

stupid Christmas cards

or something, it just...

12:38.133 --> 12:39.601

12:39.601 --> 12:43.667

the way he wanted me to.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.100
But not how it really was.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.067
He drank too much, Claudia.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.968
What more do you need to know?

12:51.968 --> 12:54.067
I wanna know what he was like.

12:55.667 --> 12:58.200
What he was really like.

Wait. This is, like,
glued this way?

13:04.868 --> 13:08.200

it's, uh, 16 bucks a night.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.667

from 20.

this cheap in San Francisco.

you could you better.

13:26.634 --> 13:28.834
Not without a job,
I can't.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.868

to start looking.

13:30.868 --> 13:32.133

No. No.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.868
I-I was just thinking about
that thing on-- On the boat.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.267
You know, the accident
with your knee,

13:48.267 --> 13:50.501
'cause that was their fault.

13:50.501 --> 13:52.434
Right?
D-didn't you say that?

13:52.434 --> 13:54.634
Yeah, it was completely against
union regulations.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.634
They should have never
sent me up that bulkhead

13:56.634 --> 13:59.033
without the bosun's rating.
Right.

13:59.033 --> 14:01.367
So it just seems to me
that they owe you something.

14:01.367 --> 14:05.234
Heh. Probably seems
a little different to them.

14:05.234 --> 14:07.634
Yeah. Well...

14:08.334 --> 14:10.100
maybe you should sue.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.968
What do you mean, sue?

14:12.968 --> 14:15.434
You mean, like--?
You mean, like go to court sue?

14:15.434 --> 14:17.601

i-it's a good idea.

14:17.601 --> 14:18.767

14:18.767 --> 14:21.801
Listen, I-I could help you
find a good lawyer,

14:21.801 --> 14:23.901
and they could get you whatever
money they owe you.

14:23.901 --> 14:26.100
And-- And you could
buy yourself some time.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.567

you're really psyched about,

stick around for.

all figured out, don't you?

get enough money so that
