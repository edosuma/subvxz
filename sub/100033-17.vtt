- Only three more meetings
and you are on your own.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.180
- If I knew being Chair
meant this many meetings,

00:50.224 --> 00:51.268
I might've reconsidered.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.748
- Hey, Reynolds said
the same thing.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.532
- Excuse me, Dr. Goodwin,
I don't mean to interrupt.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.925
Can I get your autograph?

00:55.968 --> 00:57.840
- Iggy, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.450
- Have you seen the GoFundMe
video Max is in?

00:59.494 --> 01:00.973
It blew up!
- Yeah, okay.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.063
For the record, I didn't even
know I was in that video.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.543
- And for the record, it was
also featured on "Ellen,"

01:05.587 --> 01:07.110
funded in less than
three hours, my man.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.546
- Yeah, well, I think that had
less to do with me

01:08.590 --> 01:10.026
and more to do with--
I don't know, Ellen?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.202
- Regardless, I now have--
this is a rough estimate--

01:12.246 --> 01:13.769
about 6,000 of my own patients

01:13.812 --> 01:15.510
all begging me to get you to
star in their GoFundMe videos.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.120
- No, no, no.
That's very flattering.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.730
But that is not a precedent
I wanna set at this hospital.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.167
- Maximus,
you have a gift here.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.559
You have a gift.
You should not squander it.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.213
- Anyway, try to enjoy
the ride.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.780
You have big shoes to fill,
but--

01:24.823 --> 01:26.347
- Max, I need you down
in the ED, stat.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.522
- Why?
- I'll give you a hint.

01:27.565 --> 01:29.045
Come camera ready.
- No!

01:29.089 --> 01:31.308
- Half my ward wants you to
cameo on their GoFundMe pages.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.353
I'm not sure how
you're gonna find time

01:32.396 --> 01:33.484
to do your actual job,

01:33.528 --> 01:35.356
but if anyone can do it,
you can.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.661
- Mm.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.272
Welcome to the room
where it happens,

01:38.315 --> 01:40.578
and by "it" I mean even more
boring administrative stuff.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.842
- Reynolds leaving is making
more and more sense.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.583
- Morning.
- Oh.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.760
- Uh, I did not know
you were still here.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.762
- Where else would I be?
- I don't know.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.504
San Francisco
or maybe in a bed?

01:53.548 --> 01:55.245
- Evie caught
a flight last night,

01:55.289 --> 01:57.160
and the sub-letters
are already in,

01:57.204 --> 01:59.641
but Floyd Reynolds doesn't
leave business half-done.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.599
- Business?
- Orientation.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.384
Gotta show the new Chair
the ropes.

02:03.427 --> 02:06.691
- Oh, that's very kind,
but we just--we just did that.

02:06.735 --> 02:10.217
- Oh, okay, but I gotta
introduce you to the board.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.219
Can't just get thrown
into the deep end.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.786
- Uh, Max took me
to breakfast with them.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.441
- Oh, smart.
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.922
- Okay, uh, gosh.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.316
It's just that my flight
doesn't leave until tomorrow.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.797
- Oh, we got
the new couch coming in

02:25.841 --> 02:28.626
if you wanna help carry
the old one out.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.458
- It's official.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.894
As of today, you are reinstated

02:35.938 --> 02:38.288
as Chair of Oncology
and Deputy Medical Director.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.682
- I wish I'd prepared a speech.
- I'm glad you didn't.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.814
Now that you're back,
we need you to salvage

02:42.858 --> 02:44.512
the Fighting Cancer
fundraiser tonight.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.904
- What--what's to salvage?

02:45.948 --> 02:47.558
It's being headlined
by Yo-Yo Ma.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.604
- Yo-Yo's got strep.
He's out.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.562
We need to find someone else
rich people like.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.218
Also, the teenage cancer
survivors who are speaking?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.481
Amazing kids,
incredibly inspiring,

02:57.525 --> 02:59.744
but they're also rowdy little
teenagers

02:59.788 --> 03:01.485
who need to work on
their speeches,

03:01.529 --> 03:02.878
so get on them.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.445
Oh, and per the fire marshal,

03:04.488 --> 03:05.837
the Rose Room was too small,

03:05.881 --> 03:07.491
so everything has to move
to the Atrium theater.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.580
- Karen, this is an awful lot
of ground to cover by tonight.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.974
- Afternoon would be better.
So glad you're back.

03:16.544 --> 03:19.373
- Hello, Mateo.
How are you feeling?

03:19.416 --> 03:22.289
- Just tell me.
Did it work?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.519
May I?

03:42.918 --> 03:45.616
Today, you move again.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.844
- You're him, right?
You're the GoFundMe doctor.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.281
- Max Goodwin.
- Jason Huang.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.848
I'm sorry to bother you.
- That's okay.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.372
Listen, I can't do
your crowdfunding video

04:02.416 --> 04:03.895
if that's what you were gonna--

04:03.939 --> 04:05.984
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.597
- But if there's anything
I can do for you as a doctor,

04:09.640 --> 04:13.557
then let me know
and I'll be there.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.778
- My dad gave up a good life
in China

04:16.821 --> 04:18.910
so I could grow up here.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.739
He's spent 20 years
making minimum wage,

04:21.783 --> 04:26.918
thousands of miles away from
everyone he knew for me.

04:26.962 --> 04:30.400
And I'm going to med
school next year,

04:30.444 --> 04:33.403
full ride,
thanks to him.

04:33.447 --> 04:37.712
But he needs surgery,
mitral valve stenosis,

04:37.755 --> 04:40.367
just like the girl
in your video,

04:40.410 --> 04:43.326
and the deductible,
it's so much money.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.676
I don't know what to do.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.594
- How can I help?

04:52.814 --> 04:55.860
- Hey, Dad, you awake?

04:55.904 --> 04:58.298
- Uh, I can just
come back later.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.039
- No.
Please stay.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.433
Hey, it's me.

05:03.477 --> 05:07.307
This is Dr. Goodwin.
He's gonna help us, okay?

05:07.350 --> 05:10.832
Can you sit over here by him?

05:16.838 --> 05:19.797
- All right, Dad.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.973
Can you tell Dr. Goodwin
your story?

05:29.677 --> 05:31.548
- Maybe we should try
this another time.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.855
- No, his surgery is tomorrow.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.989
We need this video to work,
or we can't...

05:38.033 --> 05:42.994
okay, uh, Dad, can you just
look at the camera and say,

05:43.038 --> 05:45.823
"I need your help.
Anything you can give."

05:47.521 --> 05:50.393
Or just smile.
Yeah, that little girl smiled.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.352
Maybe if you just smiled,
I can...

05:55.833 --> 05:57.966
Smile, Dad.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.750
Smile.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.718
It's fine if you can't talk.
They see how sick he is.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.068
It works better, right?
The sadder it is, the better--

06:13.111 --> 06:15.723
- Jason,
you don't have to do this.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.029
- Actually, I do.

06:18.073 --> 06:22.077
What other choice do I have
but crowdfunding?

06:28.431 --> 06:30.041
- Karen, I need to talk to you.

06:30.085 --> 06:34.176
She's adorable.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.179
- Well, yeah, so is
the dancing sloth that follows,

06:37.222 --> 06:39.137
but that's not why
I wanna talk to you.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.487
- It is why I want to talk
to you.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.576
I want us to facilitate
crowdfunding

06:42.619 --> 06:44.621
for everyone who needs it.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.449
It'll cost us next to nothing,

06:46.493 --> 06:49.147
just a camera and a room,
and we'll help so many people.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.192
- No.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.846
No crowdfunding.
Not for anyone.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.630
- Wait, are you kidding me?
Now you're against this?

06:53.674 --> 06:55.937
- Yes, I am.
- Well, that's absurd.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.287
Crowdfunding empowers patients
to fight bad insurance

06:58.330 --> 07:00.115
through the power
of their stories.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.508
It's a Max Goodwin trifecta!

07:01.551 --> 07:03.292
- No, it forces people to sing
for their supper

07:03.335 --> 07:05.337
at the worst possible moments
in their lives.

07:05.381 --> 07:08.210
We're making people pay
their bills with their dignity.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.994
- We're not.
Insurance companies are.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.127
- Well, I'd like them to stop.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.608
- And I'd like
to ride a unicorn.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.479
Crowdfunding works, Max.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.916
- What if I can find
a better way?

07:27.185 --> 07:30.406
- I'm sorry, but are you eating
smoked whitefish?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.147
- In fact, I am.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.627
- I love smoked whitefish.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.499
My dad used to take me
to Nussbaum's every Saturday

07:36.543 --> 07:38.240
after synagogue.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.633
- Oh, Nussbaum's
is my favorite.

07:39.676 --> 07:42.505
- Oh, mine too until it closed.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.551
Honestly, that is
the best smoked whitefish

07:44.594 --> 07:45.552
I've smelled since.

07:45.595 --> 07:48.032
- It's the dill.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.034
- Lauren Bloom,
Emergency Department.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.949
- Harold Rothman,
Psychiatry.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.431
Oh, until next time

07:55.475 --> 07:58.434
when I'll reveal the best lox
in New York,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.523
and it's not in Brooklyn.

08:04.309 --> 08:07.617
- Yeah?

08:07.661 --> 08:10.054
- Vito's for lunch today.
You in?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.708
- Uh, no, no.
Thank you.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.580
Nothing for me.
I'm okay.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.582
- Well, I'm just very
impressed.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.193
You've been sticking with
your healthy choices...

08:18.236 --> 08:20.587
- Oh.
- And you look great.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.979
- Thank you.
That's very sweet.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.590
I have a ways to go, but...

08:23.633 --> 08:25.330
Thank you.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.377
- Hey Iggy, where can I find
Dr. Rothman?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.292
I forgot to ask him where
he got his whitefish.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.424
- Um, don't know who
Dr. Rothman is.

08:32.468 --> 08:34.165
- Uh, yes, you do.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.603
Harold Rothman.
He works in your department.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.735
- No.
Sorry.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.042
- Why would be lie?
- Why would I?

08:41.085 --> 08:44.045
Okay, let's sort this out
right now.

08:44.088 --> 08:48.136
Harold Rothman.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.268
What do we got?

08:50.312 --> 08:53.271
There you go.
Left New Amsterdam in 1996.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.578
- No, no.
He's very distinctive.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.233
He's pale with, like,
bright white hair,

08:58.276 --> 09:00.496
and this, like,
an old-timey vibe.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.150
- Wait a second,

09:02.193 --> 09:04.587
did he have a mysterious smile
and soulful eyes?

09:04.631 --> 09:07.329
- Yeah.
- Okay, this all makes sense.

09:07.372 --> 09:10.332
- What makes sense?
- I don't know how to say this.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.726
The man you spoke to...

09:12.769 --> 09:14.641
is a ghost.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.034
- Thank you.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.427
- Have you not heard tell,
Lauren,

09:18.470 --> 09:20.168
of the Phantom
of New Amsterdam?

09:20.211 --> 09:23.388
'Twas many a moon 'ere first
his steps were heard.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.609
- Looks like someone's already
gotten the party started.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.219
all: Dr. Sharpe!

09:28.263 --> 09:29.786
- Look how gorgeous
you all look.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.614
And since you're relaxing,
I can assume

09:31.658 --> 09:34.138
you've all memorized
your speeches for tonight?

09:34.182 --> 09:36.445
Mm-hmm.

09:36.488 --> 09:41.581
Come on, rehearse now,
catch up later.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.543
Jessye?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.111
Can I just ask how long
you've had that limp?

09:50.154 --> 09:53.680
- Oh.
Maybe like a week?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.638
- Do you mind if I take a look?

10:02.863 --> 10:06.214
I'd like to run a few tests
on this leg.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.565
It'll be quick,
I promise.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.697
- That's where my cancer was.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.656
- There's no need to jump
to conclusions.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.497
- Your brain's impulses are
transmitted as electricity.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.238
Even since your paralysis,

10:30.281 --> 10:32.153
your brain has been sending
signals to your arm.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.503
- Your arm has just been unable
to hear them.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.593
- The silicone chips
we embedded in your brain

10:37.637 --> 10:40.857
send the signals through
these wires to your pedestals,

10:40.901 --> 10:43.512
and from there
to the robotic arm.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.470
- In a sense,
it's just a spinal cord

10:45.514 --> 10:47.255
outside of your body.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.604
- If you can master this,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.737
you'll move on to our
most advanced robotics.

10:50.780 --> 10:54.349
You'll test simulations
of cars, planes--

10:54.392 --> 10:56.656
- A plane?
I can fly again?

10:56.699 --> 11:00.268
- Let's just focus on
a finger today.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.276
- And we're live.

11:08.319 --> 11:12.628
Mateo, please try and move
your index finger.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.419
-  Okay.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.646
- It's okay.
This may take some time.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.474
We are awakening
neural pathways

11:32.517 --> 11:35.477
which you have not used
since the accident.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.349
- Gotta clear out the cobwebs,
right?

11:38.393 --> 11:42.310
- Try to remember what it was
like to move your own arm,

11:42.353 --> 11:43.877
how it felt.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.321
- Dr. Kapoor?

11:53.364 --> 11:55.453
- He's just starting.
Give him time.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.804
- It's not a time thing.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.545
Every subject that's worked has
had at least some activity

12:00.589 --> 12:02.939
in the motor cortex
upon initiation,

12:02.983 --> 12:04.854
but Mateo has none.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.595
- Move.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.858
Come on.
Move.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.949
- Let's start with
the elephant in the room.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.169
Who saw me on "Ellen"?

12:15.212 --> 12:17.345
Okay, just everybody.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.825
Well, I'm not here to talk
about Allie Baker.

12:18.868 --> 12:22.350
I'd like to talk about
Zhen Huang.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.223
Not exactly an Allie, is he?

12:26.267 --> 12:27.703
It's okay,
it's true--

12:27.747 --> 12:30.445
he's not young, he doesn't have
a winning smile,

12:30.488 --> 12:33.753
and can barely even talk.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.189
So what do you think?

12:35.232 --> 12:36.581
His story gonna be a hit
on the talk shows?

12:36.625 --> 12:37.844
- You don't have
to go on Fallon

12:37.887 --> 12:39.367
to have crowdfunding work.
- No, you don't.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.369
You just have to flaunt
your misery for money.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.805
And it gets better,

12:42.849 --> 12:44.546
the public starts voting
with their wallets.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.505
It's a Tragedy Olympics where
the contestants are dying

12:47.549 --> 12:49.681
and the judges vote
not on medicine,

12:49.725 --> 12:53.424
but on whose story
is the cutest.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.558
- So, what are you suggesting?

12:56.601 --> 12:57.907
- Let's get new judges.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.996
There's only one group
who knows which patients

13:00.040 --> 13:02.825
are the most deserving--
doctors.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.915
So when patients can't afford
even the deductible,

13:05.959 --> 13:08.875
the doctors in this room
will decide who gets the money.

13:08.918 --> 13:12.792
I have got a $100,000 set aside
for patients like Allie.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.359
And I'm willing to bet
that all of us

13:15.403 --> 13:17.971
have patients
who could use a little help.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.409
Mine is Zhen Huang.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.758
So we're gonna decide who
gets the money

13:22.802 --> 13:25.326
not with emotion with reason.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.893
I'd like to present

13:26.936 --> 13:28.938
New Amsterdam's response
to GoFundMe...

13:30.766 --> 13:32.463
WeFundYou.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.425
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Yeah, what?

13:37.468 --> 13:38.687
Need a consult?

13:38.730 --> 13:40.036
- No, I was just surprised
to see you.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.821
I thought you already left.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.434
- Whoa, whoa, hey!
Watch it!

13:46.477 --> 13:48.697
Easy there, big guy.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.029
- Hello?

14:18.770 --> 14:20.642
Someone help me!

14:20.685 --> 14:21.948
- Hello?

14:21.991 --> 14:23.819
- I'm down here!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.908
Help!

14:25.952 --> 14:28.432
- Hang on!
- Help me!

14:30.826 --> 14:32.306
- Okay.
Don't worry.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.003
Hang in there.
I got you.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.703
I'm coming.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.718
- Hey, I'm Dr. Reynolds.
What's your name?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.503
- Tevi.
- Tevi.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.983
Okay, yeah.
Let me see.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.680
Let me see.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.421
Yeah, okay.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.944
You've got a little bit
of trouble here, Tevi, okay?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.425
When you fell,
you broke a rib, all right?

15:04.468 --> 15:05.992
So I'm gonna
take care of you, okay?

15:06.035 --> 15:07.689
First, I just gotta get you
out of here.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.040
Whoa.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.441
- Stage 4 Hodgkin Lymphoma

15:20.484 --> 15:21.964
is more deserving than
a Stage 4 Neuroblastoma?

15:22.008 --> 15:25.185
- No, what I said was
my patient is more deserving,

15:25.228 --> 15:26.490
because she's so young;
she's only nine.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.362
- Yeah, g-guys?

15:28.405 --> 15:30.842
Let's try to think about
this rationally.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.235
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

15:32.279 --> 15:34.498
- I didn't say you were
an idiot, I said it was--

15:34.542 --> 15:38.154
- This $100,000 they're all
fighting so hard for,

15:38.198 --> 15:40.330
where exactly is it
coming from?

15:40.374 --> 15:43.464
- Funny enough, the next item
on my agenda was going to be

15:43.507 --> 15:48.034
finding the money,
rationally and thoughtfully.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.426
- Don't play stupid.

15:49.470 --> 15:50.558
You're only thinking about
your patients.

15:50.601 --> 15:51.994
- That is the whole point,
Steve!

15:52.038 --> 15:53.561
- What's her name?
- Lisa!

15:53.604 --> 15:55.171
- Let me know how that goes.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.956
- What you're saying is that
she's gonna go home sick,

15:56.999 --> 15:59.045
and that I'm supposed
to let her die.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.872
- There we go.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.005
Okay.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.267
All right, just relax.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.053
I'm gonna get us help, okay?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.274
Okay, Tevi, just relax.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.015
Just breathe through
your nose like this.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.279
Okay, try it.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.368
Okay.
Okay, kiddo.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.457
All right.
All right.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.677
Tevi, listen to me.
Listen to me.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.418
Now when we breathe,

16:24.461 --> 16:27.203
we make a vacuum
with our chest, all right?

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
With that rib you broke,

16:28.770 --> 16:31.207
it poked a hole from your lungs
to the outside world.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.209
So now you can't make a vacuum.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.994
So all we gotta do is we gotta
make you a vacuum.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.257
Ah, here we go.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.910
- Now we're talking.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.260
Okay, do me a favor.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.913
Can you hold this for me
like this?

16:41.957 --> 16:44.003
Hold it right there, okay?

16:50.487 --> 16:53.273
- We're gonna make that vacuum,
buddy.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.363
Here we go.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.452
- Okay.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.977
Now take a deep breath.
Come on.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.067
It's holding.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.329
Good.
Now take another one.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.202
- There you go.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.726
That's it.
That's it.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.989
Good.
You're doing great.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.600
All right, you wanna tell me

17:16.644 --> 17:19.255
how you wound up down here
in the first place?

17:19.299 --> 17:22.084
Huh?
Come on now.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.694
I promise you
I've heard crazier.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.609
- Oh...

17:25.653 --> 17:27.698
- What?
- You're bleeding out,

17:27.742 --> 17:29.396
and we've got to get you
to the OR.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.093
How long before your family

17:31.137 --> 17:33.443
or your friends
realize you're gone?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.705
- A few hours,

17:34.749 --> 17:36.968
but someone's gonna notice
you're gone, right?

17:46.630 --> 17:49.111
- Don't say it.
- I'm sorry.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.766
I do not know if it is
the chips, the pedestals, or--

17:51.809 --> 17:53.246
- Or me.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.465
- We're not registering
any relevant brain activity.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.467
And your pain--
- I'm fine.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.296
- The EEG shows the brainwaves
that signal pain.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.168
You're not fine.
- No!

18:02.211 --> 18:03.560
I can do it.
I just--

18:03.604 --> 18:05.084
- Mateo.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.390
-  Move.

18:16.182 --> 18:20.403
I ran airlifts in combat zones.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.449
I could land a C-2 Greyhound

18:22.492 --> 18:24.581
smack in the middle
of an aircraft carrier

18:24.625 --> 18:27.323
getting hit by 30-foot waves,

18:27.367 --> 18:32.111
and now...
I can't move a finger.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.291
It's in my somewhere.
I know it.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.426
- Detach his arm.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.167
Hook him up
to a flight simulator.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.778
- The simulator is an advanced
cerebral interface.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.389
- Mateo is a pilot.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.609
Flying is in his blood,
his bones, his neurons.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.177
- If his brain comes
to associate reawakening

18:55.221 --> 18:56.831
the motor cortex with pain,

18:56.874 --> 18:59.268
anything alive in there might
never wake up.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.617
If he fails at the simulator,

19:00.661 --> 19:02.793
it won't just be
an emotional setback.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.578
It could be
a neurological one.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.536
- There is no flight
without a leap.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.544
Mateo, Would you like to fly?

19:51.712 --> 19:53.409
- Let's get her
a pulmo consult with Loeb.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.368
- Okay.
- Hey, what's up?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.108
- Hi. So, funny story.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.371
I was over at
the vending machines,

19:58.414 --> 20:00.416
not eating candy or anything,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.245
I was just looking at it...
- Iggy, I do have a job.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.856
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
I do too.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.469
So, I saw Dr. Rothman.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.123
Pretty sure I did.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.343
He's old, white hair,
pale skin.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.823
The whole thing.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.173
And I think he's just, um...

20:18.217 --> 20:20.131
it's the darndest thing.
He just...

20:20.175 --> 20:22.438
Vanished is the word, I guess.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.441
What?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.748
- Okay,
I don't really know how to...

20:27.791 --> 20:31.142
I googled him
after we talked, and...

20:31.186 --> 20:32.274
- And?

20:32.318 --> 20:35.234
- Harold Rothman died
four years ago.

20:37.671 --> 20:42.153
- Your limp is being caused by
a soft tissue sarcoma

20:42.197 --> 20:43.807
in your popliteal fossa.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.682
It's aggressive.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.645
I'm gonna need
to schedule you for surgery,

20:55.689 --> 20:57.343
and I'm gonna have
to call your parents.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.649
- I already called.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.521
I knew what you were gonna say.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.310
- Jessye, if you would like
to go to a little of the party,

21:08.354 --> 21:09.442
there is time.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.313
- Why would I go to the party?

21:11.357 --> 21:14.577
That party is for kids
who beat cancer.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
I lost.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.538
- Cancer doesn't
have winners and losers,

21:18.581 --> 21:20.670
and anyone who makes you feel
that way

21:20.714 --> 21:22.368
does not know what
they are talking about.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.934
- You made me feel that way.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.851
The stupid speech.

21:29.723 --> 21:33.335
"I was 12 when I learned
I had cancer.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.685
"I was told I was in
for the fight of my life.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.905
"I battled each cell
of my sarcoma.

21:37.948 --> 21:41.604
New Amsterdam taught me how
to fight and how to win."

21:43.606 --> 21:46.827
Your party is called
Fighting Cancer.

21:46.870 --> 21:51.919
So, yeah, cancer won
and I lost.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.015
- No pulse.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.713
Going again.
Clear.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.715
Doctor, crash cart bedside.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.327
- What happened?
- Sinus brady and hypoxia.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.980
- Did you push Atropine?
- Times two.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.026
- Okay, hang epi drip,
4 micrograms per minute,

22:12.069 --> 22:14.333
and let's put on Zoll pads
for external pacing

22:14.376 --> 22:16.378
in case the epi isn't enough.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.379
- Bag it.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.474
- Breathing pattern
ineffective.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.133
- One, two...

22:37.094 --> 22:38.879
Hey, why don't you
tell me how you--

22:38.922 --> 22:40.228
you got here in the hospital?

22:40.271 --> 22:43.100
- Alpha 1
Antitrypsin deficiency.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.364
Come here
a few times a month

22:45.407 --> 22:47.061
for a gene transfusion.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.410
- Only at New Amsterdam?

22:48.454 --> 22:52.196
- Sometimes at Baptist.
- Oh, then I want to know.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.937
Do we have the best
elevator shafts,

22:53.981 --> 22:57.114
or does Baptist got us beat?

22:57.158 --> 22:59.247
- That's more like it.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.075
All right.
Here we go.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.294
One, two...

23:09.083 --> 23:10.824
Yes.
Yeah.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.869
You like that?

23:12.913 --> 23:14.349
Pry this open,
get you to the OR,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.046
and get you fixed up.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.225
Hey!
Hey!

23:21.269 --> 23:23.445
We're down here!
- We're down here!

23:23.489 --> 23:25.186
- Help!
- Hey!

23:25.229 --> 23:26.927
- Hey,
there's somebody down here!

23:26.970 --> 23:28.885
Hey!
Hey!

23:28.929 --> 23:31.410
Hey, we're down here!
Oh!

23:38.982 --> 23:41.463
- Clear?
I've got a pulse.

23:41.507 --> 23:44.031
- So do you think it'll work?

23:44.074 --> 23:45.467
- I don't know.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.513
- The insurance company says
dad's setback

23:47.556 --> 23:49.297
is classified as
a new disorder.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.951
We owe two deductibles now.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.301
We'll have to sell everything

23:53.344 --> 23:56.478
unless I post it and it works.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.349
- Well, I couldn't find you
a better way,

23:58.393 --> 24:01.004
so why haven't you?

24:02.266 --> 24:04.486
- I showed my dad the video.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.923
He said if he has to beg
to live, he'd rather die.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.969
That's how he was brought up.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.493
If I post it,
he'll never speak to me again.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.541
How can the only way to save
him be losing him forever?

24:34.429 --> 24:36.997
- Hey!
Oh, damn.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.828
- Dr. Bloom.
- Hey, I found him.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.091
- What?
- He's on the fourth floor.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.527
- Dr. Rothman?
- Yes, the fourth floor.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.442
Meet me there.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.924
You know, growing up,
my Aunt Norma always claimed

24:50.967 --> 24:52.273
to have the sight.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.970
- Mm-hmm.
- This makes sense.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.276
She always said that you can
only see

24:55.319 --> 24:57.147
what you are pure enough
to receive.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.193
Oh, she would just
be absolutely thrilled

24:59.236 --> 25:01.021
if my new diet
had somehow purified me.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.979
She always said, "You're never
gonna get the sight

25:03.023 --> 25:04.415
if you don't stop eating
chocolate, Iggy."

25:04.459 --> 25:05.547
- Iggy.
Iggy.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.462
Look.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.246
- Oh.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.427
Dr. Rothman?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.303
- How are you doing today?

25:25.219 --> 25:27.613
- Wait, this is the...

25:27.656 --> 25:29.919
- Alzheimer's Ward.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.404
- We think we're in time,

25:36.447 --> 25:38.145
but with a relapse this
aggressive,

25:38.188 --> 25:41.104
we're gonna need to monitor
Jessye's tissues regularly.

25:41.148 --> 25:44.586
Thinking about something
that Jessye said,

25:44.630 --> 25:48.068
how you were asked to talk
about fighting cancer, right?

25:48.111 --> 25:51.071
How you beat it?

25:51.114 --> 25:54.161
Can you rip those speeches up,
please?

25:54.204 --> 25:55.902
Go on.
I'm serious.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.338
Take them out and rip them up.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.906
If they're on your phones,
delete them.

26:05.302 --> 26:09.698
Now tell me,
from the heart...

26:11.439 --> 26:14.573
How does it feel
surviving cancer?

26:16.183 --> 26:18.620
- Scared.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.623
You know, um,
even though I'm in remission,

26:21.667 --> 26:25.061
it feels like I'm just waiting
for it to come back.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.498
- Um, ungrateful.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.370
I, like, beat this huge thing,

26:29.413 --> 26:31.546
but I feel like
I should never complain

26:31.590 --> 26:33.940
or feel down
about anything else.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.509
This is what people
should hear.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.643
This is what I want you
to talk about tonight.

26:42.557 --> 26:45.604
- So we nix the uplifting
stories of beating cancer,

26:45.647 --> 26:48.389
and replace them with raw,
improvised stories

26:48.432 --> 26:49.695
from terrified children?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.479
- It's the truth.
People wanna hear the truth.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.960
- If there's one place people
do not want to hear the truth,

26:54.003 --> 26:55.701
it's a pediatric oncology ward.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.138
Donors want to hear
that we're beating cancer,

26:58.181 --> 26:59.661
that we're going
to beat more cancer.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
- Those kids were lying.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.752
We asked them to lie.

27:04.710 --> 27:08.148
So now they're gonna tell their
stories, their real stories.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.063
And for some of them,
it's not a fight

27:10.106 --> 27:11.717
or it's not a fight
that they're winning.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.376
Fair point.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.291
So sorry.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.730
- Wow.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.691
- We're gonna be okay.

27:31.432 --> 27:35.175
Because as soon as this
elevator tries to move...

27:35.218 --> 27:37.177
- It was a selfie challenge.

27:37.220 --> 27:42.138
- What?
- That's why I was down here.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.619
See who can get
the most extreme shot.

27:45.707 --> 27:51.278
So I forced open
the elevator doors,

27:51.321 --> 27:54.585
leaned back in the chair,
and...

27:58.415 --> 28:01.767
I'm so stupid, I know.

28:07.598 --> 28:10.384
- The younger patients,

28:10.427 --> 28:13.561
you know, the ones
who come here a lot,

28:13.604 --> 28:16.216
they tend to feel left out.

28:16.259 --> 28:19.393
Their friends are off
doing things and,

28:19.436 --> 28:21.743
you know,
they're just stuck here.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.746
Wanting people
to remember you...

28:26.661 --> 28:30.317
That's not stupid.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.711
We all want that.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.718
- Hey!
Help!

28:39.761 --> 28:42.111
- Hey!
- We're down here!

28:42.155 --> 28:43.547
We're in the shaft!
- Help us, please!

28:43.591 --> 28:45.245
Anybody! Hey!

28:45.288 --> 28:46.768
- Please! Help!

28:46.812 --> 28:48.291
- Do you hear someone in there?

28:48.335 --> 28:49.510
- What was that?

28:49.553 --> 28:52.252
- Is someone down there?
- Hello? Hello?

28:52.295 --> 28:55.211
- We're gonna get out of here.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.697
- I'm gonna set
the plane in motion,

29:02.741 --> 29:04.568
but you have to make it fly.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.787
Like with the arm.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.789
Imagine pressing a button,

29:07.833 --> 29:09.660
and if your neural pathways
are connecting,

29:09.704 --> 29:11.271
the sim will press the button.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.490
If you don't connect,
you'll crash.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.121
- Reset.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.259
Reset.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.663
- How many hours have you spent
in a cockpit?

29:55.706 --> 29:57.883
- More than I can count.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.667
This should be
second nature to me.

29:59.710 --> 30:03.497
- I suspect it still is.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.891
Close your eyes.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.284
Close your eyes now.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.678
Visualize the cockpit.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.596
Tell me, what is
the farthest left indicator

30:15.639 --> 30:17.685
on the instrument panel?

30:17.728 --> 30:20.427
- The ASI.
The airspeed.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.299
- Keep going.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.519
- The attitude indicator.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.651
Compass.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.524
Up is the fuel gauge.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.656
- You know this plane.

30:32.700 --> 30:36.443
This is your plane,

30:36.486 --> 30:38.358
not a simulator.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.577
- This is my plane.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.884
- Say it again.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.844
- This is my plane.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.370
- Mateo, we are moving now.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.502
You have a half-billion
dollar plane

30:52.546 --> 30:54.678
that is your responsibility.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.419
We are near the end
of the runway.

30:56.463 --> 31:00.554
You have to get us up
in the air right now.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.447
- He's flying.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.557
- Wow.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.951
That's a...

31:49.995 --> 31:51.518
that's a dress.

31:51.561 --> 31:54.521
- Yes, and those are scrubs.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.392
- That they are.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.482
I guess this concludes our game
of name that clothing item.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.702
Um, I need to talk to you
about crowdfunding.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.660
- After you get dressed.
You're gonna be late.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.488
- For what?
- The fundraiser.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.055
- Which is tonight?
- It's in ten minutes.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.709
Just throw something on
and get down there,

32:08.752 --> 32:10.363
I've got to prep the kids.
- Uh, kids?

32:10.406 --> 32:11.625
- The ones who are sharing
their stories.

32:11.668 --> 32:12.974
- To raise money
for this hospital?

32:13.018 --> 32:14.933
- Oh, yes.
It's a fundraiser, Max.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.673
- Yeah, with the kids
that we're exploiting

32:16.717 --> 32:18.937
to emotionally manipulate
people for cash.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.982
- No one is exploiting anyone.
- You're damn right we're not.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.724
We're cancelling
that fundraiser.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.946
- Uh...

32:31.993 --> 32:34.300
- It's called
therapeutic fibbing.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.519
Instead of correcting
the patient's delusions,

32:36.563 --> 32:38.173
you accept them.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.001
- So everyone here treats
Dr. Rothman

32:40.045 --> 32:41.960
like he's still a doctor?
- Within reason.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.788
Whenever he leaves the floor
he has minders with him.

32:44.832 --> 32:48.270
It's startling, I know,
but stability slows dementia.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.446
And nothing's
more destabilizing

32:50.490 --> 32:52.100
than forcing people
to acknowledge

32:52.144 --> 32:54.146
they're in the grip
of delusions.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.975
Excuse me.
- Have a good day.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.588
- Okay, so I never
actually googled Rothman.

33:01.631 --> 33:04.025
- Yeah, no kidding.
- I'm sorry.

33:04.069 --> 33:07.986
Hey, it was just a joke
that got out of hand.

33:08.029 --> 33:11.076
But I thought that he was like
a visiting doctor or something.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.295
I never thought
that he was a patient.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.949
And I never really thought

33:14.993 --> 33:16.298
that you would think
that he was a ghost.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.517
I'm sorry.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.692
- No, Lauren,
I'm not mad at you, okay?

33:18.735 --> 33:20.128
I'm mad at myself
for even half-believing

33:20.172 --> 33:22.087
any of this nonsense.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.132
- Okay, but that's my fault.
- No, it's not.

33:24.176 --> 33:27.135
It's all me.
I'm the problem.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.442
- Iggy...

33:29.485 --> 33:31.444
- Sing a little song,
do a little dance.

33:31.487 --> 33:32.923
Just be yourselves.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.490
If you need anything, I'll...
- Helen.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.144
- Yeah, I'll be with you
in just a sec.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.580
- Yeah, well, I meant that

33:37.624 --> 33:39.060
in the "what the hell"
kind of sense.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.540
This does not look like
a cancelled gala.

33:40.583 --> 33:41.976
- That's because it's not.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.151
My first act as the newly
restored

33:43.195 --> 33:45.023
Deputy Medical Director
was to ignore you.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.198
- I can't believe
that you are okay

33:46.241 --> 33:47.938
with exploiting
these children.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.117
Kids?

33:52.160 --> 33:54.032
Quick question.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.077
Do you want me
to cancel the gala?

33:56.121 --> 33:59.863
- Don't you, like,
need the money to cure cancer?

33:59.907 --> 34:03.171
- Yes, but if not if it means
making you speak publicly

34:03.215 --> 34:05.652
about something that you would
rather keep private.

34:05.695 --> 34:08.002
- I mean, are y'all
being forced to do this?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.308
- We want to do this.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.092
This is how we help
the next kid with cancer.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.529
- This is how we help Jessye.

34:13.573 --> 34:17.316
- Max,
this isn't exploitation.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.492
This is gratitude.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.277
- Gratitude?

34:23.626 --> 34:25.498
- You may know it
from such situations

34:25.541 --> 34:27.674
as the time I saved you
from recklessly cancelling

34:27.717 --> 34:29.502
an important fundraiser.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.548
- Right.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.334
Now I'm grateful that
you're willing to be Deputy

34:35.377 --> 34:37.466
to a proven doofus.

34:39.338 --> 34:42.950
And I'm also grateful
because...

34:42.993 --> 34:45.692
you just showed me
how to do crowdfunding right.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.100
- Mateo, we have to stop.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.449
- No, no.
Not yet.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.626
- You have an infection
at your surgical site.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.497
We have to remove the implant.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.630
- No.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.199
No, I just wanna stay up here.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.289
- But with the infection
this close to your brain,

35:17.332 --> 35:21.119
we must stop now.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.097
- Mm.
- Hey.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.665
- Hey.

35:45.708 --> 35:49.147
- You know that I would never
intentionally mock

35:49.190 --> 35:51.323
Alzheimer's patients, right?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.673
- Of course.
- Good.

35:53.716 --> 35:57.067
- Parkinson's, though...

35:57.111 --> 35:58.678
Just a little bit funny?

35:58.721 --> 36:01.202
- That's maybe the worst joke
you've ever made.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.339
- You seem really upset.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.645
- Yeah, you know,
I'm--I'm--

36:09.689 --> 36:12.300
I've just been going
through some stuff.

36:12.344 --> 36:15.042
- That's why I'm here.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.306
Wanna talk about it?

36:22.484 --> 36:25.139
- So I've been on this diet,

36:25.183 --> 36:29.796
and it's making me feel cold
and drowsy and weak.

36:31.276 --> 36:35.541
And I've been having vivid
food fantasies.

36:35.584 --> 36:40.720
And today, I temporarily
believed in ghosts,

36:40.763 --> 36:42.678
which is...

36:42.722 --> 36:44.463
that's not funny, really.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.813
It's, um, it's more like what
happens

36:46.856 --> 36:50.295
when my food stuff goes
a little too far.

36:52.558 --> 36:55.213
But I don't even look good yet,

36:55.256 --> 36:57.084
and people are giving me
compliments already,

36:57.127 --> 36:58.477
so you do the math.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.609
How terrible must I have looked
before?

37:00.653 --> 37:03.612
So even if this diet
is intense,

37:03.656 --> 37:06.746
it's necessary,
right?

37:12.578 --> 37:15.145
- Mateo.

37:16.886 --> 37:20.281
It's not fair.

37:20.325 --> 37:24.416
I encouraged you
to go through so much.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.374
To get so little in return.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.339
I'm sorry.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.604
- I'm not.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.610
I'll never walk again...

37:46.220 --> 37:48.657
But I got to fly.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.407
- How long were you and this
kid in the elevator?

37:59.451 --> 38:00.843
- About four hours.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.324
Spleen isolated and removed.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.934
- Music to my ears.

38:04.978 --> 38:08.677
- There's a small tear in the
diaphragm near the sternum.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.505
Can I suture?

38:11.724 --> 38:13.508
- Ask the Chair.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.295
- Show me what you got.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.474

38:22.517 --> 38:25.172

really not gonna see you

38:47.499 --> 38:49.501
until the wedding?
- Yeah, but it'll be fine.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.330
- I'm not fine.
I'm sad.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.940
- Well, you know
how these things go.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.724
You know,
like I just did the surgery

38:55.768 --> 38:58.205
and we saved the kid,
and everything was great,

38:58.248 --> 38:59.815
but the whole time
I was thinking

38:59.859 --> 39:02.470
this isn't my OR anymore,
you know?

39:02.514 --> 39:05.821
Things end.
People forget.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.476
- Tevi will remember.

39:08.520 --> 39:12.262
So will every single one
of your patients...

39:12.306 --> 39:15.396
and so will I.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.746
- Thank you.

39:17.790 --> 39:21.315
- And so will every single one
of your friends

39:21.359 --> 39:23.926
who are waiting around
this corner to surprise you.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.538
- Hey!
- Yo!

39:28.757 --> 39:30.498
- Surprise!

39:30.542 --> 39:32.805
- Don't be mad.
It's just a small event.

39:36.461 --> 39:40.987

39:41.030 --> 39:44.947

41:02.590 --> 41:05.767
- I got the surgery I needed
to survive last year.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.639
- I got mine ten years ago.

41:07.682 --> 41:11.425
- We got money to keep
our little girl healthy,

41:11.469 --> 41:13.688
but what about
the next little girl?

41:13.732 --> 41:16.604
Our family has
so much gratitude

41:16.648 --> 41:19.477
and we want to help
whoever comes next.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.609
- Last year, I almost died.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.655
Now I'm going to college.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.874
Can you help
the next person like me?

41:25.918 --> 41:29.095
We get to tell our stories
because we're survivors.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.575
- I'm a survivor.

41:30.618 --> 41:33.012
all: And we want our friends
to be survivors too.

41:35.971 --> 41:40.541
- Last year, I was diagnosed
with squamous cell carcinoma,

41:40.585 --> 41:42.891
and, uh...

41:42.935 --> 41:44.937
I didn't want to admit
that it was happening.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.548
I didn't want
to talk about it,

41:47.592 --> 41:49.942
not even with
my closest friends.

41:49.985 --> 41:53.989
But in New Amsterdam and all
the amazing people in it,

41:54.033 --> 41:57.819
they--they helped me
through it.

41:57.863 --> 42:00.126
So I'm a survivor.

42:00.169 --> 42:03.695
And so many others aren't,
not yet.

42:03.738 --> 42:07.612
So that's why
I'm asking you to donate

42:07.655 --> 42:12.747
because it's not for me,
it's for them.
