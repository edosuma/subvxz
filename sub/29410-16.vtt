[woman gasping, whimpering]

21:09.746 --> 21:11.182
[screams]

21:12.488 --> 21:14.969
The one my mother's
been searching for.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.536
The girl in the box.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.539
Why do you call her that?

21:19.582 --> 21:21.062
I found her in a trunk

21:21.105 --> 21:23.847
my father kept
in the basement of our house.

21:23.891 --> 21:28.591
She comes to me in visions.

21:28.635 --> 21:29.897
I tried to save her.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.333
I think.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.249
But I still feel responsible.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.426
And in my nightmares,
she likes to remind me of that.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.604
You were only ten.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.214
It's not your fault.

21:44.564 --> 21:48.872
Look, I hate that I messed
things up between us.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.353
I really wanted...

21:52.398 --> 21:55.575
What?

21:55.618 --> 21:58.099
What did you want?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.583
[cell phone vibrating]

22:05.498 --> 22:07.282
[groans] Damn it.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.329
Uh, would it ruin everything
if I took that?

22:10.372 --> 22:13.201
It's safe to say
we've weathered worse.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.295
-Gil.
-Vijay slipped his tail.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.514
He's in the wind.

22:21.557 --> 22:24.168
He's meeting
with the Ghost Phoenix.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.909
Making a deal with Coop
to buy the watches.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.172
You have any idea
where he'd set that meeting?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.523
I might. Uh, I'll drop you
a pin right now.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.698
Meet me there.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.453
How'd you find me?

22:47.496 --> 22:51.065
Your dad used these docks
to smuggle cocaine in the '80s.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.067
You used to brag
about how he ran down

22:53.110 --> 22:56.070
a Colombian hit man
in his Bentley.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.506
You were in the back.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.029
Yeah.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.683
That's great. You need to go.

23:00.727 --> 23:03.033
You told me you weren't
gonna do a side deal.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.948
-You lied to me.
-This is my job.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.515
Making deals with bad people.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.431
These aren't just bad people.
There's a thrill killer.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.172
This isn't just another deal.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.219
Gil is on his way.

23:15.263 --> 23:18.309
All we have to do is wait.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.704
Gil's not gonna make it.
They're here.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.706
You got to leave.
If they find out you're a cop...

23:23.750 --> 23:25.534
Dead. Got it.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.057
I'm not leaving.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.624
-Come on.
-[sighs]

23:30.060 --> 23:33.194
I'm meeting new people,
being social.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.804
It's good for us.

23:38.025 --> 23:41.158
Coop! Fellas, how we doing?

23:41.202 --> 23:44.161
Ready to make a deal?

23:44.205 --> 23:45.554
Mr. Chandasara.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.078
This isn't a plus-one situation.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.384
Who's this?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.125
I'm Malcolm Bright.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.651
The appraiser.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.219
The suits in London need him
to check out the merchandise

23:58.262 --> 24:00.961
-before they release funds.
-He's clean.

24:01.004 --> 24:05.879
But I'm thinking y'all still
want to make some money tonight.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.620
Am I right?

24:09.535 --> 24:11.537
Let's go.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.453
Boom.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.591
All right, Mr. Bright.

24:22.635 --> 24:25.202
Here's what we're selling.
Take a look.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.509
Make sure it all meets
your exacting standards.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.468
We can move
the watches ourselves.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.948
We don't need to trade them
to this guy for a finder's fee.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.994
Yeah, a rush sale like this?

24:34.037 --> 24:35.778
You'll be lucky to get 15%.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.781
You've got 20 minutes.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.483
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.310
I'm gonna make a deal
with these guys,

24:46.354 --> 24:47.660
and everyone walks
out of here happy.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.531
Sound good? Great.
Glad you agree.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.402
-I have a plan.
-I knew you were gonna say that.

24:51.446 --> 24:54.405
Haggle with Cooper. Draw it out.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.929
Give me time to figure out
who the thrill killer is.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.626
[quietly]: That could be
any of these guys.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.368
You handle the money,
I'll handle the killer.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.544
Coopy-Coop!

25:02.588 --> 25:05.199
Let's make some magic happen.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.855
[phone ringing]

25:11.858 --> 25:14.034
This phone is reserved for
telemarketers and politicians.

25:14.077 --> 25:17.124
Identify yourself so I know
how hard to slam the receiver.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.647
Mrs. Whitly.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.911
You kept the old number.
How sentimental.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.304
[whispers]:
Martin?

25:23.347 --> 25:25.915
It's good to hear your voice.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.177
What do you want?

25:27.221 --> 25:29.353
Uh, to make a complaint.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.573
What did you say to our son?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.619
Malcolm isn't
answering my calls.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.403
I haven't said a word to him.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.144
You know, I'd hate
to tell the police

25:37.187 --> 25:39.494
the wrong story, Jess.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.671
-But my feelings have been hurt.
-[sighs]

25:42.715 --> 25:44.499
Psychopaths don't have feelings.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.414
Actually, we do.

25:46.457 --> 25:50.418
Trick is, we can turn them off
whenever we want.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.333
Well, he isn't answering
my calls, either.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.248
I know as little as you.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.729
Oh. Well, do you think
he's all right?

25:56.772 --> 25:58.774
I hadn't considered
I should be worried.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.560
Forgot to turn on
those feelings?

26:01.603 --> 26:05.389
[laughs softly]
So is this what it's like?

26:05.433 --> 26:07.566
Worrying about your kids,

26:07.609 --> 26:09.872
thinking of all the terrible
things that could be happening?

26:09.916 --> 26:10.699
[laughs]

26:10.743 --> 26:14.398
Parenting is tough stuff.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.705
It's good to have
someone to talk to,

26:16.749 --> 26:19.403
someone who cares
as much as you do.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.405
You're right.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.407
I should call Gil.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
[phone clicks]

26:25.627 --> 26:28.630
And she turns the dagger.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.025
SHEILA:
Surprise, suckers. [laughs]

26:32.068 --> 26:34.680
Taking your money feels so good.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.638
BRIGHT:
This wasn't about the robbery.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.901
-This was about the thrill.
-[silenced gunshot]

26:38.945 --> 26:40.337
PETE:
Hey.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.818
What are you looking at?
Eyes on the prize, man.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.951
Leave him be, Petey.
Guy's got work to do.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.910
Kid's kind of young
for this work.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.434
Hothead's got to learn
his place.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.915
So, you born in that suit,
or does appraising

26:52.959 --> 26:55.135
just pay a whole lot better
than I thought?

26:55.178 --> 26:57.224
[laughs softly]
I was born in it.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.356
Had a Brooks Brothers onesie.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.881
-How about you?
-Other side of the tracks.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.840
But I'm working my way
out of a bad situation.

27:04.884 --> 27:08.191
I get cash, lolz, jewelry,
and one-percenters like you

27:08.235 --> 27:11.630
bankroll it all of it
whether you like it or not.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.936
-Power to the people.
-[chuckles]

27:13.980 --> 27:15.068
You're cute.

27:15.111 --> 27:17.810
I could steal you, too.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.468
What did Sheila say to you?

27:24.512 --> 27:27.689
Nothing special. Small talk.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.779
-You two together?
-Yeah. We are.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.652
Kind of.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.306
Keeping your options open.
Got it.

27:36.350 --> 27:39.701
Always heard this was the most
stressful part of the job,

27:39.745 --> 27:42.269
waiting.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.358
People get greedy.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.882
Not sure who you can trust.

27:46.926 --> 27:50.364
How did you get
into this line of work?

27:52.366 --> 27:54.324
[groans]

27:54.368 --> 27:56.152
Explosive temper.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.676
-Good to know.
-[Vijay whoops]

27:57.719 --> 27:59.765
VIJAY:
We got a deal, Coopy!

27:59.808 --> 28:02.942
This guy did me dry.
[chuckles]

28:02.985 --> 28:04.291
What happened here?

28:04.334 --> 28:06.380
He's a cop.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.780
I've been watching him.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.434
He's been sucking up information
on our team for an hour.

28:17.478 --> 28:20.089
-I'm not a cop.
-Yeah, he's not a cop.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.438
COOPER:
Grant.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.832
He ain't gonna talk.

28:23.876 --> 28:27.836
-[clears throat]
-[grunts, groans]

28:28.707 --> 28:30.143
VIJAY:
Uh, Coop,

28:30.186 --> 28:31.535
what are you doing?

28:31.579 --> 28:33.276
You know I'm legit.
I just transferred

28:33.320 --> 28:34.887
30% to your account.

28:36.584 --> 28:39.761
That's the thing. You'll talk.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.896
[Coop grunting, Vijay groaning]

28:45.201 --> 28:48.161
-[coughs]
-The question is,

28:48.204 --> 28:51.425
how much pain gets me the truth?

28:51.468 --> 28:53.427
Who is he?

28:53.470 --> 28:56.691
Stop! Stop.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.173
I'm not a cop,

29:00.216 --> 29:02.349
but...

29:02.392 --> 29:05.134
I do work with the NYPD.

29:05.178 --> 29:08.007
I'm a profiler.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.878
Close enough.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.575
You're dead.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.666
We got to kill them and go.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.059
You're not turning
cop killer today.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.192
Well, what are you gonna do
about it, hmm?

29:19.235 --> 29:22.021
Leave Vijay out of this.

29:22.064 --> 29:26.199
If you ever want to see the rest
of your money, don't hurt him.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.766
Excellent point. Thanks, buddy.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.943
Shut up. Let me handle this.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.599
[chuckles]

29:35.643 --> 29:38.167
Alex, take Vijay
back to the docks.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.516
Help him with the merchandise.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.650
I'll take care of this profiler.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.217
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.133
Hold on. Hold on!

29:48.395 --> 29:49.788
I can't leave without him.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.616
You're in no position
to negotiate.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.490
He's my friend.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.666
Friend?

29:58.709 --> 30:00.842
Don't, Vijay.
I know what happens next.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.802
You're gonna leave!
You have to. I get it.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.412
I knew I shouldn't have come.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.805
I knew it in school.

30:06.848 --> 30:10.504
Really? You're gonna
bring up school here?

30:10.547 --> 30:13.072
What the hell
does that even mean?

30:14.116 --> 30:16.249
I never could trust you.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.338
You're just like your dad.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.992
Go.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.210
Save your own ass.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.256
Get in your Bentley and go.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.561
I drive a vintage Porsche.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.389
That'll work, too.

30:26.433 --> 30:27.651
Just go!

30:27.695 --> 30:29.262
Hey, hey...

30:29.305 --> 30:31.830
[van door closes]

30:52.894 --> 30:54.853
GIL:
Looks like Vijay
got what he wanted.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.681
Yeah, but where's Bright?
He said he'd be here, too.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.248
We'll follow the van.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.772
Hopefully it leads to...

31:02.599 --> 31:03.905
What the hell?

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
What is Vijay doing?

31:06.908 --> 31:08.170
[sighs]

31:08.214 --> 31:09.911
[engine starts]

31:16.265 --> 31:20.966
So, why does a profiler care
about a bunch of thieves?

31:21.009 --> 31:23.185
GRANT:
Boss, we don't
have time for this.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.709
COOPER:
Easy, Grant.

31:25.753 --> 31:28.321
I want to know.

31:28.364 --> 31:31.411
Ah. Got it.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.978
Got what?

31:33.021 --> 31:36.938
We're both trying to
figure out the same thing.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.940
Which one of them
is the killer.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.900
What the hell does that mean?

31:41.943 --> 31:45.555
Two jobs in two days,
both planned to the second.

31:45.599 --> 31:49.124
Both end with a dead civilian,
shot in the same way.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.735
It's got you thinking.

31:52.954 --> 31:56.044
Is he right? This profiler?

31:56.088 --> 31:58.220
Yes, I'm right.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.482
Almost always.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.355
-So, who is it, then?
-Obviously not you.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.617
As for Alex...

32:05.575 --> 32:06.925
He's family, right?

32:06.968 --> 32:09.014
His first job, maybe.

32:09.057 --> 32:12.278
You sent him with Vijay,
so you trust him.

32:12.321 --> 32:14.454
You can't say the same
for these three.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.630
PETE:
We've been a team
for five years.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.719
