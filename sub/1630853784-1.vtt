WEBVTT

00:52.886 --> 00:53.636
Oh!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.098
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, yeah!

00:57.182 --> 00:58.183
Hey! Ha-ha-ha!

00:59.517 --> 01:01.102
Yeah!

01:01.186 --> 01:02.729
Hey!

01:02.812 --> 01:07.108
Yeah-ha!

02:36.448 --> 02:38.074
- Oh, it's so beautiful
out here today.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.618
- Yeah, sure is.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.621
- Oh, did you see the ray?
- Yeah, huge.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.290
- Look what I got.
- Whoa, nice.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.670
Hey.

02:50.754 --> 02:51.629
- Hey

02:51.713 --> 02:53.882
- Look what I scored.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.219
What? How did you do that?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.263
- You need to learn
the way of the fish.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.640
- Having fun, sis?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.309
- Yeah.
- Group shot.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.313
All right, okay, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.066
- Yeah.
- One, two, three, smile.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.073
- That was so much fun.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.618
I'm so glad you got
me back into diving.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.119
- You're a natural.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.037
- Like you?

03:28.083 --> 03:28.875
Hey, what's that?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.211
- Oh, I don't know.
- How good

03:31.294 --> 03:33.171
are the islands going to be?

03:33.254 --> 03:35.048
- I know, right?

03:35.131 --> 03:37.258
The tropical water,
all that sunshine,

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
fish everywhere.
- Mm, yeah.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.303
- Can't wait.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.389
- Greg come around to it yet?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.973
- Not really.
- Come on.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.143
It's just like book club only
with fish and spear guns.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.645
He gets that, doesn't he?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.855
- Sort of.
- Hmm.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
He'll come around to
it once he realizes

03:53.358 --> 03:55.193
what it means to you.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.111
- Isn't that Greg?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.239
- Yeah, it is.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.832
- Hey, babe. Ladies.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.418
- What are you doing here?

04:11.501 --> 04:13.503
- Well, that's
a nice way to greet the guy

04:13.586 --> 04:14.963
who's come to give
you a ride home.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.464
- But I said I had a lift.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.260
- Okay, well, I
thought it'd be nice

04:20.343 --> 04:21.302
to pick you up myself.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.182
- Thank you.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.892
- See you, sis.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.688
- See you guys.
- See ya.

04:46.202 --> 04:50.290
- God, will you get it
through your fucking head?

04:53.752 --> 04:54.544
Get in!

05:08.266 --> 05:10.643
- Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.856
- Hey, sis. Uh, hope all's okay.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.442
Um, just give me a ring. Bye.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.373
Hey.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.458
How was your day?

05:33.541 --> 05:34.626
- Hmm?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.878
- Have you left
the house at all?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.464
- Uh, well, I'm an exotic bloom,

05:39.547 --> 05:40.840
so I'm not meant to be outside.

05:40.924 --> 05:45.095
- Oh, okay, well, exotic bloom,

05:45.178 --> 05:47.972
like we agreed, if you're gonna
be staying here for a while,

05:48.056 --> 05:49.099
you need to be
pulling your weight.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.308
- You sound like mom.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.646
- Well, she has a point.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.314
- Look, I'm just
different. Okay?

05:56.398 --> 05:57.357
I'm not like you and Cath.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.233
- Mm-hmm.

06:09.285 --> 06:13.415
- Hey, I gotta go, but
I'll be back soon, okay?

06:20.422 --> 06:22.924
- Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.166
- Hello?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.645
Greg?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.070
Greg?

07:36.623 --> 07:37.415
Greg?

07:43.380 --> 07:45.006
- She wouldn't listen.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.427
- Where's Cath?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.596
Where's my sister?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.224
- She made me do it.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.066
- Cath?

08:05.819 --> 08:06.611
Cath?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.666
Cath?

08:37.142 --> 08:40.102
Cath!

09:57.138 --> 09:59.849
- Hello.
- There she is!

09:59.933 --> 10:03.520
Aw.
- How are you?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.522
- Wow, look at you.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.774
Ah, Jodes, guess who's here?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.570
- Nic! We we starting to worry.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.280
I didn't know if you
got my last message

10:14.364 --> 10:15.615
about the change of address.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.033
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.577
It's, uh, hard getting
online in rural India.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.871
- India. How was that?

10:21.955 --> 10:22.997
- It was good.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.377
Well, I got something.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.297
Tequila?
- Ooh-ah!

10:31.381 --> 10:32.674
Party time.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.094
- It's so good to see you.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.263
- Yeah, you too.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.307
- It's amazing, isn't it?

10:43.852 --> 10:44.811
- Yeah, it is.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.694
- Yeah, I'll go get the drinks.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.868
- What do you
think? Is she okay?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.625
- At least she's here.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.501
- Yeah.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.964
- Ready?
- Ready.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.595
- Here you go

11:18.678 --> 11:19.596
- Oh, thanks.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.807
What? Annie.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.979
Oh my God. What
are you doing here?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.190
- I wanted to surprise you.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.485
- Huh. Yeah, you've
definitely done that.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.404
So what you're into diving now?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.156
- Well, yeah, sort of.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.369
- What's that?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.247
- Oh, that, we wanted
to talk to you about it.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.836
You know, coming here
was Cath's dream.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.755
So we thought it'd
be the perfect place

11:53.838 --> 11:54.714
to pay our tributes.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.219
We all thought it
was a good idea,

11:59.302 --> 12:00.637
but if you don't
think it's right then-

12:00.720 --> 12:05.934
- No, no, I'm sure
it's great.

12:07.227 --> 12:11.106
Uh, I'm kind of tired
from the long trip.

12:11.189 --> 12:11.981
Where's my room?

12:13.817 --> 12:18.279
- Yeah, I'll show you.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.155
- Hmm.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.500
Here you go.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.501
- Thanks.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.715
- Can I have the wine after you?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.925
- Yeah.
- Oof, look at you go.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.803
- Want some more.
- Yes.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.806
- Why don't we
make a toast here?

13:32.812 --> 13:33.605
Top up?

13:34.564 --> 13:35.690
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.611
Hmm.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.782
What have you been up to?

13:43.865 --> 13:44.866
- Not much.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.660
Um, just working,
looking after mom.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.123
I made an apple
pie the other day.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.626
- What? You're cooking?

13:54.709 --> 13:57.003
That's great.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.428
- So is it true?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.764
You were working in the
Greek Islands on a dive boat?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.974
- Yeah.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.769
Yeah, taking happy
snaps of rich divers.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.942
But, um, yeah, it
didn't really work out.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.988
Stopped diving, actually.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.367
- Really?

14:28.827 --> 14:29.619
- Yeah.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.835
- Hey, come and help me
cook the marshmallows

14:36.918 --> 14:40.213
'cause I keep dropping
them in the fire.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.297
Watch out for that.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.968
Clutz.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.555
Here.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.046
- Three days of
paddling. Three days?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.380
I thought you said it was two.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.466
- It's two nights, but
three days paddling.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.426
Two days wouldn't
be worth coming for.

15:27.844 --> 15:28.928
- Three days of paddling.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.807
- Don't worry. We'll
take it easy on you.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.100
Won't we, Jodie?

15:34.184 --> 15:34.976
- Of course.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.064
- You did say that there was
gonna be a four-star resort.

15:39.147 --> 15:43.693
- There is, absolute luxury,
rising pool, cocktails.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.612
Everything a girl could want.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.863
That's the third night.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.075
- The third night? Great.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.202
- Here we go.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.413
- Look at that.
- Oh.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.209
Oh my God.
- Come on, slow pokes.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.758
- Let's go.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.930
- Okay, who wants what?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.266
Actually, Annie,
thinking about it,

16:15.350 --> 16:16.851
maybe you should take
one of the yellow ones.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.520
Easier to get in and out of.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.938
- Sure.
- Lisa,

16:20.021 --> 16:21.815
you'll take the
other yellow one.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.568
- Okay.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.445
- Okay. Let's get packing

16:27.529 --> 16:30.073
And remember to distribute
the weight evenly.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.492
- Is she always this alpha?

16:33.410 --> 16:36.037
- Mostly.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.467
- Okay. Let's go.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.089
- How are you? You okay?

18:09.172 --> 18:10.465
- Yeah.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.050
- You look tired.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.052
You wanna take a break?

18:14.135 --> 18:16.304
- No, I'm not really tired.
I don't need a break.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.229
- You know, Annie
don't get me wrong,

18:24.312 --> 18:26.231
it's great to see
you, it's just like

18:27.941 --> 18:29.317
this isn't really you.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.947
- You might be surprised.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.367
- Come on. I'll tow you.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.203
- I'm fine. Thanks.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.753
- Hmm.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.513
- Yeah,
this is the place.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.141
- Yes. Hey, we're
gonna go for a dive.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.282
- Oh. It's so beautiful.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.967
- Mm.
- Oh.

19:36.051 --> 19:36.843
- Hey.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.304
Ready?

19:40.430 --> 19:43.016
- Uh, I'm just
gonna float up here.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.309
- Come with us?

19:44.392 --> 19:45.185
- Okay.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.109
- Let's go over here for a bit.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.827
Nic, follow me down?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.329
- I'll come down in a minute.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.205
- Okay.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.316
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

21:56.399 --> 21:57.484
- Can you help me get out?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.277
- Well, yeah, of course.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.362
- Okay.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.322
- I think I've
damaged my spearhead.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.287
- Hey, you coming down?

22:10.455 --> 22:12.499
- Oh, my sinuses are playing up.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.376
Think I'm coming
down with something.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.546
- Okay. See you soon?

22:18.630 --> 22:20.048
- Mm. Yeah.

22:20.131 --> 22:20.924
- Okay.

22:38.566 --> 22:42.028
- There's kids
swimming on that island.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.411
Wait, what's that?

22:51.579 --> 22:54.207
- Lots of fish around.
Must be a bait ball.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.359
Shit.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.487
- What?
- I think I saw a shark.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.449
- Was it big?

23:27.532 --> 23:30.535
- I don't know. I, I just
saw the tip of the fan.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.968
We should let them know, right?

23:47.052 --> 23:48.178
- Yeah.
- Nic!

23:49.846 --> 23:51.514
Nic, there's a shark!

23:59.356 --> 24:00.940
Nic, there's a shark!

24:02.567 --> 24:03.443
Come on! Nic!

24:06.571 --> 24:09.282
Look out! There's a shark!

24:09.366 --> 24:12.327
- Hi.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.620
Check this out.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.246
- There's a shark!

24:19.918 --> 24:22.587
Nic, come back! I
think I saw a shark!

24:22.671 --> 24:23.463
Come back!

25:02.711 --> 25:05.588
- I
can't see anything.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.257
- Okay.
- Stay calm.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.634
Don't splash.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.791
I didn't see anything.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.019
You saw a shark?

26:01.102 --> 26:02.103
- Annie did.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.022
- How big?

26:05.273 --> 26:07.984
- I don't know. I
just saw the tip.

26:08.068 --> 26:11.279
- It's probably a reefy.
There's lots of 'em around.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.864
- Yeah. They're mostly harmless.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.326
So many fish came through.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.620
- I know. Look what I scored.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.579
- Oh, wow.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.209
- It's almost lunch time.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.586
The sooner we get to the
island, sooner we eat.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.422
Nic, why don't
you and I go ahead

26:29.506 --> 26:30.924
and start cooking up this fish?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.844
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.013
I was just worried
about you guys.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.598
Go cook lunch. I'm starving.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.475
- Okay.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.976
- Okay?
- All right, let's go.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.751
Feeling better?

27:09.921 --> 27:11.214
- Yeah.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.090
- Nice.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.180
- You all good?

27:20.140 --> 27:21.433
- Yeah. I'm fine.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.560
- Is that the first
time you've met the man

27:23.643 --> 27:24.978
in the gray suit?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.771
- What?
- The man in the gray suit.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.857
That's what surfers call sharks.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.108
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.693
I've seen a few.

27:31.776 --> 27:32.902
They're pretty timid usually.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.321
It's the big ones you
have to worry about.

28:49.896 --> 28:53.525
Lisa!

30:16.983 --> 30:18.026
Lisa.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.029
Lisa!

30:31.206 --> 30:32.582
Oh, Lisa!

30:36.086 --> 30:36.836
Lisa!

31:01.569 --> 31:03.029
- Annie!

31:20.046 --> 31:20.839
Annie!

31:42.193 --> 31:43.403
Oh my God!

32:07.135 --> 32:08.011
Annie!

33:05.735 --> 33:08.196
Shark!

33:10.490 --> 33:11.574
Shark! Shark!

33:17.288 --> 33:18.623
- Shit. What's going on?

33:18.707 --> 33:20.000
I'm going back.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.795
Come on. Let's go.

34:33.031 --> 34:33.822
- Lisa.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.993
Come on, swim to me.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.208
Lisa, come on.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.212
Lisa, focus on me. On me.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.630
Look at me.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.385
Come on, Lisa. Lisa!

34:54.594 --> 34:56.513
Swim to me. Swim to me.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.351
Keep coming, keep coming!

35:28.336 --> 35:30.213
Lisa, watch out!

35:32.590 --> 35:33.383
Lisa!

35:36.261 --> 35:37.303
Lisa!

35:40.473 --> 35:43.601
Oh, no.

35:46.396 --> 35:48.314
Where did you go?

35:48.398 --> 35:49.274
Lisa! Lisa!

36:02.829 --> 36:03.621
- Lisa!

36:05.123 --> 36:05.915
Lisa!

36:08.626 --> 36:09.419
Lisa!

36:10.754 --> 36:12.255
Lisa!

36:18.261 --> 36:19.054
Lisa!

36:45.705 --> 36:48.124
- Annie, we need
to flip the kayak.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.000
- Yeah.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.170
- Hey, you're gonna have
to get in the water.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.719
I'm gonna get in, we'll
turn it over, okay?

37:15.985 --> 37:19.322
Okay, okay.

37:20.365 --> 37:21.825
All right. Come on.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.543
Come on.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.382
Very good. Good.

37:42.554 --> 37:43.763
Get in. Quick.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.024
You okay? Okay.

38:22.844 --> 38:23.636
Hey.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.099
Hey, you okay?

38:30.352 --> 38:32.145
Honey, can you paddle?

38:34.064 --> 38:35.482
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:35.565 --> 38:36.983
Okay. Come on.

38:37.067 --> 38:39.069
- We have to get to the island.

38:39.152 --> 38:39.944
- That's where we're going.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.279
- No, I mean right now.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.531
There are kids swimming
on that island.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.830
- Oh my God.

38:50.914 --> 38:52.248
Jodie! Jodie!

38:54.000 --> 38:55.502
There are kids in the water.

39:00.423 --> 39:01.800
- Oh my God. I'll go warn them.

39:01.883 --> 39:03.218
You stay with Annie.

39:07.806 --> 39:09.808
- Annie, can you paddle?

39:11.935 --> 39:13.269
- Yeah.

39:13.353 --> 39:15.563
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

39:17.148 --> 39:19.776
Yeah!

40:08.575 --> 40:10.285
Oh my God.

40:19.878 --> 40:22.839
Oh
my God. Oh my God.

40:22.922 --> 40:23.715
Oh my God.

40:29.387 --> 40:31.306
God.

40:31.389 --> 40:32.182
Oh my God.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.208
- Shark!

40:58.291 --> 40:59.000
Shark!

41:03.922 --> 41:05.340
Shark!

41:05.423 --> 41:06.966
See ya.

41:56.224 --> 41:57.475
- Shark! Shark!

41:58.393 --> 41:59.227
Mom, shark!

42:08.987 --> 42:10.071
Shark! Shark!

42:12.282 --> 42:13.575
- Shark! Shark!

42:14.534 --> 42:17.746
Shark, shark! Winston, hurry up!

42:19.330 --> 42:20.415
Faster! Faster!

42:20.498 --> 42:22.375
Winston! Come on, come!

42:39.934 --> 42:41.603
Stay there, Demi!

42:41.686 --> 42:43.396
Demi, don't move, don't move!

42:43.480 --> 42:44.856
Good girl!

43:47.085 --> 43:49.045
Oh my God.

43:56.261 --> 43:57.387
- Yeah. Good girl.

43:57.470 --> 43:58.722
Come on, come on, come on.

44:07.647 --> 44:09.858
Move, move faster, faster!

44:20.827 --> 44:22.203
Come on, here, gir

44:24.456 --> 44:27.584
Here.

44:38.511 --> 44:41.514
Oh God!

44:52.650 --> 44:54.319
- Come on! I got ya!

45:02.452 --> 45:03.870
- Oh, okay!

45:03.953 --> 45:06.247
- My, my leg!

45:06.331 --> 45:08.458
- You're okay. You're
all right, baby.

45:08.541 --> 45:10.960
You're okay.

45:22.806 --> 45:24.099
- Are you okay? Hey?

45:29.938 --> 45:32.190
Lisa's gone. She's gone.

45:32.273 --> 45:34.109
- Come here. It's okay.

45:34.192 --> 45:36.027
It's okay.

45:40.448 --> 45:42.409
Okay. All right, come on.

45:42.492 --> 45:44.703
Hey. It's gone, right?

45:44.786 --> 45:46.788
Come on. Let's go, okay?

45:48.957 --> 45:50.041
- Demi! Demi!

45:53.420 --> 45:54.629
Here, here! I got her!

45:54.713 --> 45:56.798
Get her up here! Come on!

45:56.881 --> 45:58.967
Get the towels! Quick, quick!

45:59.050 --> 46:00.385
Oh gosh.

46:00.468 --> 46:02.470
Give them to me. Okay, okay.

46:02.554 --> 46:04.723
We have to put pressure on it.

46:04.806 --> 46:07.559
Keep pressing, that's fine.

46:07.642 --> 46:09.853
Keep pressing. Keep pressing.

46:09.936 --> 46:11.855
Okay. You're okay.

46:11.938 --> 46:13.314
You're gonna be
fine. Look at me.

46:13.398 --> 46:15.525
Okay, yeah. Look at me.

46:15.608 --> 46:17.652
- Is there anyone
else on this island?

46:17.736 --> 46:20.739
- No. We came here fishing
with our husbands two days ago.

46:20.822 --> 46:22.115
- Okay. Where are they?

46:22.198 --> 46:23.867
- They've gone.
They've taken the boat.

46:23.950 --> 46:25.827
They'll be gone for days.

46:27.829 --> 46:30.040
- Okay. You're
okay, you're okay.

46:31.332 --> 46:32.459
Maybe we should elevate the leg.

46:32.542 --> 46:34.294
- Right.
- Here are a few towels.

46:34.377 --> 46:35.086
- It's okay. You're
gonna be okay.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.212
You're all right.

46:36.296 --> 46:37.756
- And breathe in.
- Okay.

46:37.839 --> 46:39.382
- It's all right.
- Here you go.

46:39.466 --> 46:41.217
Here you go, you're okay.
- You're gonna be fine.

46:41.301 --> 46:43.219
- Do you have any phone
reception, internet,

46:43.303 --> 46:44.387
any way of getting help?

46:44.471 --> 46:46.598
- No. It's all dead.

46:46.681 --> 46:48.850
The, the next island there's
reception and people.

46:48.933 --> 46:50.226
- Okay. What about boats?

46:51.144 --> 46:52.854
There's, there's a runner boat.

46:54.314 --> 46:57.067
- Okay. Can you show us?

47:09.954 --> 47:13.291
- That? That's not safe.

47:14.417 --> 47:15.877
Look what it did to the kayaks.

47:23.551 --> 47:24.928
Hey, what are you doing?

47:25.011 --> 47:27.514
- I'm just gonna have a look.

47:31.851 --> 47:34.729
- Wait. I'll come with you.

49:25.048 --> 49:26.883
I know we have to help her.

49:26.966 --> 49:29.135
Okay? I know that.

49:29.219 --> 49:31.888
But this, this won't
get us to the island.

49:33.181 --> 49:35.433
You saw what it did to the
kayaks and the pontoon.

49:37.977 --> 49:38.728
Jodie?

49:40.313 --> 49:41.523
- Yeah, it's not great.

49:46.152 --> 49:47.779
- So there are no other boats?

50:03.086 --> 50:05.422
What if we make it more stable?

50:05.505 --> 50:06.881
If we tie one of the kayaks here

50:06.965 --> 50:09.259
and the other one here,
we can make it stable.

50:11.011 --> 50:12.053
- Yeah, maybe,

50:13.680 --> 50:15.098
but we're still
not gonna be safe.

50:23.189 --> 50:24.315
What are you doing?

50:24.399 --> 50:25.984
- I'm going to try it out.

50:26.067 --> 50:29.821
- Let me help ya.

50:29.904 --> 50:31.322
- Annie.

50:31.406 --> 50:34.159
- I know we need to get to
the island, but not like this

50:36.661 --> 50:37.912
- Annie, this isn't safe.

50:38.872 --> 50:40.206
- We need to get her help.

50:40.290 --> 50:41.791
I'm going to get the kayaks.

50:43.543 --> 50:45.712
- No. Jodie.

50:45.795 --> 50:47.130
Annie, please just wait!

50:53.928 --> 50:54.679
Annie!

51:17.827 --> 51:20.246
- Is this good?
- Yeah, it's good.

51:20.330 --> 51:22.040
Three, two, one.

51:46.106 --> 51:47.440
I can't get it out of my mind.

51:50.652 --> 51:51.486
Poor Lisa.

51:52.529 --> 51:55.281
- Jodie, come here.

51:59.577 --> 52:01.454
Look, what happened
to Lisa was...

52:03.623 --> 52:05.000
But we have to keep going.

52:13.091 --> 52:15.093
- You made it.

52:15.176 --> 52:18.263
- Yeah, once you get used
to it, it handled okay.

52:18.346 --> 52:20.223
So we just need to
finish trying it here

52:20.306 --> 52:22.434
and then we can go get help.

52:22.517 --> 52:23.685
- So this is your plan?

52:25.186 --> 52:26.104
- Yep.

52:26.187 --> 52:27.147
- Yeah, it's that simple?

52:27.230 --> 52:28.857
- I guess so.

52:28.940 --> 52:30.817
- "Cause what could
possibly go wrong?

52:31.985 --> 52:33.111
- Look, if you don't
wanna come, that's fine.

52:33.194 --> 52:34.779
- It's not that.

52:34.863 --> 52:36.072
We need to slow down and we
need to think this through.

52:36.156 --> 52:37.449
- We don't have
time to slow down.

52:37.532 --> 52:39.701
- Yes, there is. We need
to think this through.

52:39.784 --> 52:40.910
- I have thought this through.

52:40.994 --> 52:42.203
- No you haven't. Not properly.

52:42.287 --> 52:43.496
Would you just listen to me?

52:43.580 --> 52:45.248
This isn't you,
you can't do this!

52:45.331 --> 52:47.959
- Don't tell me what
I can and can't do!

52:48.043 --> 52:49.252
You don't know me.

52:49.336 --> 52:50.628
And you know what?

52:50.712 --> 52:53.256
Your sister Cath,
your best friend.

52:54.382 --> 52:55.508
You didn't know her either.

53:12.484 --> 53:14.694
- We have to do something.

53:35.590 --> 53:36.716
- Remember what to do?

53:37.801 --> 53:39.135
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi.

53:39.219 --> 53:40.595
- How are you all?

53:43.306 --> 53:45.433
- Here. These are for you.

53:46.976 --> 53:48.561
Some protection
if it comes back.

53:50.230 --> 53:53.233
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

53:53.316 --> 53:56.403
We pray and make it to
the next island safely.

54:13.128 --> 54:14.254
- I'm coming with you.

54:16.131 --> 54:17.424
- You don't have to
do that, Nic. Really.

54:17.507 --> 54:19.342
- Yes, I do.

54:24.514 --> 54:25.306
- Okay.

54:36.192 --> 54:36.943
- Here.

54:42.157 --> 54:42.949
Let's go.

54:44.284 --> 54:46.286
- Three, two, one, push.

56:30.473 --> 56:33.476
- Looks like we're
near the channel.

56:48.533 --> 56:49.534
- Shit.

56:49.617 --> 56:51.828
- What?
- We're leaking.

56:51.911 --> 56:54.122
- Oh shit.

56:54.205 --> 56:55.707
- How bad is it?
- I don't know.

56:55.790 --> 56:58.043
It's hard to tell but
it's definitely coming in.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.629
- Here, bucket.

57:04.424 --> 57:06.343
Where's it coming from?

57:06.426 --> 57:07.469
Can anyone see where
it's coming from?

57:07.552 --> 57:08.887
Oh shit.

57:08.970 --> 57:09.763
Sorry.

57:11.139 --> 57:12.390
- Let me have a go.
- No, it's all right.

57:12.474 --> 57:13.767
I've got it.
- Sit down.

57:24.527 --> 57:29.532
- Fuck.

57:34.829 --> 57:35.622
Come on.

57:37.707 --> 57:39.459
- Check the petrol.
- Come on.

57:39.542 --> 57:41.127
It's not the petrol.

57:41.961 --> 57:42.754
- Please, check.

57:56.142 --> 57:56.935
It's half full.

57:58.520 --> 58:00.397
- Maybe we hit something.
Check the prop.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.191
- I don't think so.
I would've felt it.

58:03.274 --> 58:06.152
Oh, shit.

58:12.409 --> 58:14.494
- Here, let me have a go.

58:47.902 --> 58:48.987
- What is it?

58:50.822 --> 58:51.614
Nic?

58:57.078 --> 58:59.289
- I thought I heard something.

59:16.723 --> 59:17.766
Fuck!

59:21.269 --> 59:23.104
I knew we shouldn't have
come out here in this thing.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.647
- Well, we had to do something.

59:26.566 --> 59:28.735
- Look I know, but not in this!

59:28.818 --> 59:30.153
- I said you didn't
have to come.

59:30.236 --> 59:31.613
I said that Jodie and
I were gonna do it.

59:31.696 --> 59:34.366
- Like that
would have changed anything!

59:34.449 --> 59:35.700
This still would've
happened, Annie!

59:35.784 --> 59:37.744
- Okay. Well at least
I tried something.

59:37.827 --> 59:40.205
At least I did something and
I didn't run away like you.

59:40.288 --> 59:41.915
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

59:41.998 --> 59:44.084
- All right, all right. Enough.

59:46.419 --> 59:47.671
All we can do is paddle.

59:48.672 --> 59:49.673
So let's paddle.

01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:47.689
- What did you mean

01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:51.192
back at the beach?

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.113
What did you mean when you said

01:00:55.196 --> 01:00:56.489
I didn't know who
you and Cath were?

01:00:57.949 --> 01:01:00.577
- Oh, nothing.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.411
It was nothing.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.788
- Can you just tell me?

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:06.791
- Okay.

01:01:09.502 --> 01:01:11.338
Well, you didn't
come to the funeral,

01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:15.675
and then the next day you
are out of the country

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.885
and you haven't come back.

01:01:20.013 --> 01:01:22.432
I was left holding
it all together.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:27.270
The funeral, the police inquiry.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.647
Mom's depression. Mine.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.235
I'm not as weak
as you think I am.

01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:35.612
- Who said you were weak?

01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:38.907
- And Cath, she
wasn't weak either.

01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:44.371
You didn't know her
and you don't know me.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.373
You left.

01:01:56.341 --> 01:01:57.384
- I couldn't.

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:03.848
I just couldn't.

01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:34.796
- Hey, look.

01:02:44.347 --> 01:02:46.766
- Paddle. Come on, paddle.

01:03:51.122 --> 01:03:51.915
Annie!

01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:58.171
Annie!

01:04:09.015 --> 01:04:09.808
Annie!

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:15.271
Annie, slowly.

01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:21.319
That's it. Stay calm.

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:33.748
Come on.

01:04:56.855 --> 01:04:57.939
Annie!

01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:00.775
- Annie!

01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:03.653
- Annie!

01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:07.657
Where is she? Where is she?

01:05:09.242 --> 01:05:10.285
- There she is!

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.141
Annie! Annie, come on!

01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:34.309
You're, you're okay.

01:05:34.392 --> 01:05:36.186
I've got you. I've got you.

01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:46.696
Okay. Okay.

01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:51.534
All right. Come on.

01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:03.713
Come on.

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.262
- Come on.

01:06:14.182 --> 01:06:16.017
You're okay.

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:17.310
Come on.

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:18.478
I've got you.

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.689
That's it, come on.

01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:22.148
- Uh!

01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:23.108
- You're all right. It's okay.

01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:24.025
Come on. I've got you.

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:26.111
- Let me see. Let me see.

01:06:28.321 --> 01:06:29.447
Come on.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.074
Here. Get this off.

01:06:31.157 --> 01:06:32.826
Get this off.

01:06:32.909 --> 01:06:35.745
Oh, my God. Just
got the life jacket.

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:38.331
Oh my God. It missed you.

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:40.875
It missed you.
- Oh!

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:53.805
- You're alive.

01:06:54.973 --> 01:06:56.057
You're alive.

01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:59.227
I'm sorry for everything,

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.771
for not being there to help you,

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:04.190
for not being at the
funeral, just everything.

01:07:06.568 --> 01:07:07.777
I just, I couldn't,
I couldn't, I just...

01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:17.162
I could have done
something. I...

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:24.336
I should have known. I
could have done something.

01:07:24.419 --> 01:07:28.214
Save my sister, I should
have done something.

01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:31.551
- No one knew. That's
the worst part.

01:07:31.634 --> 01:07:33.345
She never said anything.

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:05.126
- Oh, God. It's still here.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.381
- What the fuck? Fuck off!

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:12.217
Shit!

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:22.435
- I can't see it anywhere.
- Oh, fuck.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.192
- There!

01:08:48.127 --> 01:08:48.920
- Fuck.

01:08:56.344 --> 01:08:58.930
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:08:59.014 --> 01:09:01.640
Why doesn't it leave
us the fuck alone?

01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:10.233
- Nic, what are we gonna do?

01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:14.237
We have to get to that island.

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:17.698
We have to keep paddling.

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:24.788
Nic?

01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:29.919
Nic?

01:09:31.337 --> 01:09:32.921
- No.

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:33.840
- No?

01:09:33.923 --> 01:09:34.883
- No more paddling.

01:09:37.926 --> 01:09:39.095
- What, what do you mean?

01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:41.723
- That thing is stalking us.

01:09:41.805 --> 01:09:43.265
Okay, I don't know why,

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.434
if it's the paddling or what,

01:09:44.517 --> 01:09:47.228
but it's hunting us and
it's not gonna stop.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:49.606
We head for that island,
it'll come for us again.

01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:52.776
We have to get rid of it.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:55.278
We need to kill it.
- Are you crazy?

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:56.863
It's a huge fucking shark.

01:09:56.946 --> 01:09:58.948
How are we going to do that?

01:09:59.032 --> 01:10:00.367
- Do we still have that fish?

01:10:02.243 --> 01:10:03.703
- Yeah, why?

01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:04.579
- We trap it.

01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:06.873
We put the fish on the anchor,

01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:08.750
then we tie the
anchor to the kayak.

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:10.251
When it takes it, it'll
get stuck to the kayak,

01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:11.419
and it'll drown.

01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:14.756
- This is ridiculous.

01:10:14.839 --> 01:10:17.342
- To beat it, we're gonna have
to try something different.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.844
We're not gonna outrun
it. We're just not.

01:10:23.932 --> 01:10:24.724
Annie?

01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:27.394
- I'm in.

01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:34.818
- Jodie?

01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:47.163
Come on. Help me untie this.

01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:48.248
- Okay.

01:10:52.419 --> 01:10:53.712
- Okay. Got it.

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:22.050
- Wonder if it's gone.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.391
I mean, if it's gone, we
should be going for the island.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:34.396
- Hasn't gone.

01:12:36.648 --> 01:12:37.816
- How do you know that?

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:40.527
- Because it won't.

01:12:44.155 --> 01:12:45.281
- Jodie's got a point.

01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.367
If it's not here,
then we should be

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:48.785
paddling for the island, right?

01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.579
I mean, we're losing time.

01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:56.793
- Nic, if it comes,
we'll take our positions.

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:00.338
- Exactly.

01:13:00.422 --> 01:13:01.423
We have to get going
and get help for the...

01:13:04.217 --> 01:13:06.845
Oh my God. It hasn't gone.

01:13:10.056 --> 01:13:10.932
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:12.142
I don't know.

01:13:13.143 --> 01:13:14.019
- Where did it go?

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.980
- Oh, fuck.

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:21.860
- Where the fuck is it?

01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:41.504
- Undo the rope! Undo the rope!

01:13:41.588 --> 01:13:43.340
- Jodie, undo the rope!

01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.884
- Hold on!
- Jodie!

01:13:45.967 --> 01:13:47.552
Jodie! Oh fuck!

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:54.642
Jodie, hurry up!
- Jodie, untie it!

01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:56.603
Come on!

01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:00.357
- Hurry up!

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:24.506
- Whoo!

01:14:24.589 --> 01:14:25.382
We did it!

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:27.884
We got it!

01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.552
We got it.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:30.553
- It worked. It worked.

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:33.598
- Oh, we actually got it.

01:14:36.309 --> 01:14:37.102
- We did.

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:40.021
- Yeah.

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:46.528
Wow.

01:14:46.611 --> 01:14:47.987
- We should paddle.

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:51.366
- Yeah, we'll go faster
if we all paddle.

01:14:51.449 --> 01:14:52.826
Let's get rid of this.

01:14:52.909 --> 01:14:54.327
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:19.519
- Let's go.

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:20.854
- Yeah, let's go.

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:39.539
- We're almost there.
- Yeah.

01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:50.819
- Jodie!
- Jodie!

01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:56.241
- Paddle, quick!

01:16:57.075 --> 01:16:58.576
- Nic, it's coming!

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.578
- Jodie, go, go!

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.209
- Jodie, give me your hand!

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:07.210
That's it.

01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:10.046
- Oh!

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:13.425
- Pull! Come on!

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:22.100
You're okay. We've got you.

01:17:22.183 --> 01:17:22.976
You okay?

01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:26.146
Can you stand?
- Uh-huh.

01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:28.148
It's my
shoulder, it's my shoulder!

01:17:28.231 --> 01:17:29.941
- All right. Hold it
close to your chest.

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:32.861
- Shit!

01:17:32.944 --> 01:17:34.654
- All right. Ready?

01:17:35.613 --> 01:17:36.698
One, two...

01:17:36.781 --> 01:17:37.741
- Oh shit.

01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:38.658
- I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:17:38.742 --> 01:17:40.785
I'm gonna put your arm in.

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:42.579
I've got you. It's
gonna be okay.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.457
All right.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.458
Hey.

01:17:50.754 --> 01:17:51.546
Okay.

01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:54.716
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:55.633
Yeah?

01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:01.514
- Oh my God.

01:18:05.101 --> 01:18:06.269
- Shit.

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:13.860
- Nic, get down.

01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:26.414
- Where'd it go?

01:18:26.915 --> 01:18:27.540
Where is it?

01:18:31.002 --> 01:18:34.464
- Oh, it's there. It was there.

01:18:34.547 --> 01:18:35.548
- Oh my God.

01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:55.694
Oh my God! It's coming!

01:18:55.777 --> 01:18:58.655
It's coming, Nic! It's coming!

01:18:58.738 --> 01:18:59.864
- Shit. Shit.

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:12.002
- Okay, the trap
didn't work, we-

01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:42.323
You okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:43.700
You?

01:19:43.783 --> 01:19:44.868
- Annie, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:45.994
- Good.

01:19:47.037 --> 01:19:48.621
- Oh shit. We're filling up.

01:19:52.375 --> 01:19:53.835
Where's the bucket?

01:19:53.918 --> 01:19:54.794
We're fucking sinking.

01:19:56.338 --> 01:19:58.214
- How are we gonna
get to the island?

01:19:58.298 --> 01:19:59.716
What are we gonna do?

01:20:13.563 --> 01:20:14.731
- We're gonna trap
it and drown it.

01:20:14.814 --> 01:20:17.901
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:20:17.984 --> 01:20:19.486
- Kill it. Just kill it.

01:20:19.569 --> 01:20:20.362
- Yeah.

01:20:21.946 --> 01:20:22.655
Okay

01:20:26.993 --> 01:20:28.411
Hey, help with this.

01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:29.621
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna trap it

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:30.497
in the net.

01:20:32.207 --> 01:20:34.751
Here, tie it. Make
sure it's tied tight.

01:20:58.024 --> 01:20:58.817
Grab the net.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.527
When I say throw, you throw.

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:03.029
Hey, no matter what happens,
we get to the island.

01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:04.614
Okay?
- Okay, what about you?

01:21:04.698 --> 01:21:06.574
- Don't worry about me.

01:21:07.992 --> 01:21:09.285
- Nic, what about you?
- Just do it!

01:21:11.037 --> 01:21:12.539
Throw! Throw!

01:21:13.873 --> 01:21:14.958
Oh shit!

01:21:20.088 --> 01:21:20.797
Annie!

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.304
Where's the machete?

01:21:30.056 --> 01:21:31.683
Oh shit!

01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:21.084
Annie.

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:22.877
Annie. Annie, please!

01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:26.089
Annie! Annie, hey.

01:23:32.804 --> 01:23:33.596
Oh my God.

01:23:35.724 --> 01:23:36.933
Are you, are you okay?

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:38.601
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

01:23:38.685 --> 01:23:40.687
It's okay. I've got you.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.106
Here we go.

01:23:46.234 --> 01:23:48.737
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:25.815 --> 01:24:27.233
- Oh, it's Demi.

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:29.110
- Hello, hi!
- Hey, Demi!

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:29.903
- How are you?

01:24:29.986 --> 01:24:31.571
- Good. Really good.

01:24:31.654 --> 01:24:33.448
- Hey, Demi. How's your leg?

01:24:33.531 --> 01:24:34.908
- See?

01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:36.868
- That is gonna be
a beauty of a scar.

01:24:36.951 --> 01:24:40.038
- Huh, I know. I'm now
known as shark girl.

01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:41.998
The girl that...

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:42.957
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:45.210
- Oh.

01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:55.238
- To Cath and Lisa.

01:25:58.158 --> 01:26:01.828
You'll always be
with us forever.

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:09.377
Always in our hearts.
