[WHISTLES]

09:17.720 --> 09:19.920
Maybe we didn't look everywhere.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.200
What could Nutkin have
run through that would

09:22.200 --> 09:24.730
make him leave purple tracks?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.460
ALL: Berries!

09:26.460 --> 09:27.710
Lily, you're a genius.

09:31.170 --> 09:31.870
Look.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.250
All the berries are squished.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.160
Nutkin's been here all right.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.040
They're not all squished.

09:39.040 --> 09:39.820
Benjamin!

09:39.820 --> 09:40.610
Uh, uh.

09:40.610 --> 09:41.310
Sorry.

09:41.310 --> 09:42.010
Right.

09:42.010 --> 09:42.770
Glasses.

09:42.770 --> 09:43.670
Glasses.

09:43.670 --> 09:48.190
Where could they--
oh, found them!

09:48.190 --> 09:48.890
Woo hoo!

09:48.890 --> 09:50.390
Yes!

09:50.390 --> 09:52.030
Oh, tummy ache.

09:52.030 --> 09:54.040
Well done, Benjamin.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.500
Let's go!

09:55.500 --> 09:57.570
Wait!

09:57.570 --> 09:58.800
Where's he going?

09:58.800 --> 10:03.710
He's trying to get those
glasses back to Old Brown.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.920
Follow Peter's purple tracks.

10:05.920 --> 10:10.280
You're not just a genius,
you're also really smart.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]

10:17.030 --> 10:17.730
Help me!

10:22.210 --> 10:24.090
I've got you now.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.630
Oh, no.

Now you'll find out what
happens to naughty squirrels.

My hero.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.600
My glasses!

10:32.600 --> 10:33.300
Yes.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.010
And Nutkin is very
sorry he took them.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.640
Aren't you, Nutkin?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.050
Am I?

10:39.050 --> 10:40.010
I mean, yes.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.960
I am very sorry.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.810
If I give them back, will
you leave Nutkin alone?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.990
Sorry's not good enough.

10:47.990 --> 10:49.670
Then go fetch!

10:49.670 --> 10:50.930
Oh!

10:50.930 --> 10:52.480
Let's face it.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.420
Without anymore
tracks to follow,

10:54.420 --> 10:56.180
the only way we'll
find them is if they

10:56.180 --> 10:58.300
fall right out of the sky.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.960
OLD BROWN: Whoa!

10:59.960 --> 11:00.660
Hm.

Oh, that must have hurt.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.930
At least Old Brown
doesn't have any reason

11:14.930 --> 11:17.870
to chase you now, hey, Nutkin?

Does he, Nutkin?
