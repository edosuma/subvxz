02:22.774 --> 02:23.774
The White King

02:40.792 --> 02:41.925
-Give up already?

02:45.002 --> 02:46.002
I'm invincible?

02:50.548 --> 02:52.081
Tick-tock, tick-tock...

02:52.106 --> 02:54.533
Tick-tock, tick-tock...
-Wait..

02:58.342 --> 02:59.342
Check.

03:10.575 --> 03:12.749
And... mate.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.442
-I knew you could do it. Nice job.

03:24.408 --> 03:25.408
-Come on, dad!

03:25.869 --> 03:27.587
-Hey...
-Hey...

03:29.361 --> 03:30.650
-Come on...

03:41.478 --> 03:42.478
-I got it!

03:45.205 --> 03:46.671
Oh, I got it, come on!

03:47.510 --> 03:49.212
Whew! We did it.

03:49.235 --> 03:51.235
-Hey Dad, pass the ball.
-Ready?

03:56.674 --> 03:57.674
Wait...

04:20.581 --> 04:22.604
-Don't you ever turn into your father.

04:26.034 --> 04:27.034
-Go get it.

04:31.733 --> 04:32.982
What are you looking at, Hank?

04:37.233 --> 04:38.914
You see how he's watching over us?

04:39.709 --> 04:42.529
Young Hank Lumber, trail
blazer of the home land.

04:43.061 --> 04:45.225
-Believe that and you
believe anything.

04:46.038 --> 04:47.971
-My teacher said he's a hero.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.043
-You see what he's really guarding?

04:51.746 --> 04:58.009
Young Hank had loot to hide. All
the treasure you can imagine.

04:59.776 --> 05:02.783
At the foot of that statue,
there's a giant cave,

05:03.089 --> 05:04.528
filled with Young Hank's gold.

05:05.729 --> 05:06.729
-Really?

05:07.518 --> 05:10.518
-Perhaps Young Hank never existed.
-Exactly.

05:12.367 --> 05:16.634
There's a vagabond with a mangled
face who guards that treasure.

05:16.658 --> 05:18.806
He goes by the name "Pickaxe."

05:18.830 --> 05:22.122
They say he prowls around
in that fence at night,

05:23.510 --> 05:25.110
<i>whispering to the birds.</i>

05:26.963 --> 05:28.430
Who knows what's true?

05:35.227 --> 05:37.160
Don't blindly believe anyone.

06:19.735 --> 06:20.735
<i>-Peter...</i>

06:23.249 --> 06:26.531
-Fitz? Peter Michael Fitz?

06:27.374 --> 06:28.774
-Peter to my friends.

06:31.046 --> 06:33.178
-Dad?
-Djata...

06:35.616 --> 06:37.233
-Mom, what's happening?
-I don't know.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.730
-Now?
-Yes.

06:44.351 --> 06:45.618
-Can I say goodbye?

06:47.416 --> 06:48.416
-Sure.

06:49.127 --> 06:51.330
A couple of minutes won't
make a lot of difference.

07:08.784 --> 07:12.717
-Djata, these two men would
like to ask me a few questions.

07:14.089 --> 07:17.506
-These...uh, gentlemen are your
father's coworkers, right?

07:18.929 --> 07:20.718
They want him for his expertise.

07:23.156 --> 07:25.203
-Which is why I'm not going
to be here for a while.

07:25.475 --> 07:27.976
Huh? But I promise I'll write.

07:28.351 --> 07:29.351
OK?

07:29.867 --> 07:32.321
-Can I come?
-No, Djata, it doesn't work that way.

07:33.656 --> 07:35.390
Plus, you wouldn't like it there, anyway.

07:37.851 --> 07:40.634
Do you promise me you'll be good?
You'll take care of your mom?

07:41.113 --> 07:42.113
Huh?
-Yeah.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.585
You're the man of the house now.

07:45.442 --> 07:46.442
OK?
-But...

07:46.949 --> 07:48.057
-Come along, now.
-It's OK.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.907
-Don't want you to be late.

07:51.098 --> 07:54.965
And you're right. We really
need your husband's expertise.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.883
Let's go!

08:07.629 --> 08:09.229
-Stay strong. All right?

08:10.410 --> 08:11.410
-Okay.

08:12.582 --> 08:13.582
Don't go, Dad!

08:22.263 --> 08:23.263
-It's OK.

08:23.380 --> 08:24.380
It's OK.

08:24.802 --> 08:26.700
It's OK, it's going to be fine.
-See you soon.

08:34.650 --> 08:35.916
We'll see him soon.

08:36.664 --> 08:37.664
-Yeah.

09:13.791 --> 09:16.191
-As you know, tomorrow is a big day.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.445
We expect you to be punctual,
presentable, and on your best behavior.

09:20.766 --> 09:26.482
Junior Defense League cadets, remember
to pick up your uniforms and rifles here

09:26.507 --> 09:32.451
 at 1000 hours,. Make us proud...you
are the seeds of tomorrow's harvest.

09:36.470 --> 09:40.701
-Left, right, left, right...
Left, right, left, right...

09:40.724 --> 09:43.658
Left, right, left, right...left, right

09:43.683 --> 09:45.683
left, right
-Stop!

09:47.988 --> 09:48.988
And halt!

09:53.768 --> 09:55.389
-Alright, come on.
-Come on.

10:02.042 --> 10:03.042
-Faster.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.444
-Just can it, dude.
-How...how can we get it done?

10:29.760 --> 10:33.192
-Seriously, how does he expect
us to make a banner by tomorrow?

10:33.331 --> 10:35.698
That's rough.
-I'll get my dad to help.

10:35.723 --> 10:37.526
Yeah, my dad will
get us some paints.

10:37.550 --> 10:40.069
It will be sweet.
What about you, Djata?

10:41.956 --> 10:44.096
-I don't know; I'll figure something out.

10:45.596 --> 10:47.566
-Let's play some ball!
-Yeah, come on!

10:47.590 --> 10:48.673
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

10:48.971 --> 10:50.651
-You know what? I'll
catch you guys later.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.841
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:53.190 --> 10:55.135
-OK.
-Come on.

10:57.581 --> 10:59.514
-Let's go boys! Whoop, whoop!

11:21.928 --> 11:23.053
-Hey, losers!

11:25.241 --> 11:26.574
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:26.598 --> 11:28.598
-Oh, yeah, there it is!

11:28.622 --> 11:30.622
-What do you got? What do you got?

11:30.646 --> 11:32.646
-OK...
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:33.126 --> 11:34.326
-Alright, come on!

11:35.439 --> 11:37.602
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:38.945 --> 11:40.612
Do the head, do the head!

11:40.636 --> 11:42.636
-Oh, no!
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

12:02.842 --> 12:04.175
-Hi, Mrs. Setterman.

12:11.733 --> 12:14.000
-Tomorrow, starting at 1200 hours,

12:14.282 --> 12:16.282
citizens in every corner of our land,

12:16.454 --> 12:20.090
will celebrate the 30th anniversary
of our great independence.

12:20.897 --> 12:22.581
-Hi!
-...glory to the homeland.

12:22.605 --> 12:24.605
-It's a letter, it's from your dad.

12:48.173 --> 12:50.040
-Did someone cross this out?

12:51.501 --> 12:53.358
-Oh yeah, they...sometimes do that.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.508
It's okay.

12:58.173 --> 12:59.173
Go on.

13:09.057 --> 13:10.324
-"I'll see you soon."
-Yeah.

13:19.335 --> 13:20.607
-"You just have to be patient."

13:22.167 --> 13:25.854
-Yeah. You're absolutely right.
They just can't do without him.

13:35.757 --> 13:36.757
Is that good?

13:38.187 --> 13:39.187
-Yeah...

13:41.730 --> 13:42.831
-I got to go to work.

13:43.246 --> 13:44.246
You'll be OK?

13:44.832 --> 13:45.832
-Yeah.

13:49.136 --> 13:50.136
-Alright.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.014
-Goodnight, mom.
-'Night.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.315
-How many times do I have to tell you?

14:09.722 --> 14:11.971
It's a wasteland;
just read the signs.

14:11.995 --> 14:13.995
-They wouldn't put a
sign saying "Treasure".

14:14.151 --> 14:16.542
I don't care what you think. My
dad says there's gold in there.

14:18.743 --> 14:20.257
-He's kind of been away for a while.

14:21.954 --> 14:22.954
Your dad.

14:23.845 --> 14:25.845
He's OK? He's not sick, is he?

14:26.434 --> 14:28.730
-Sometimes you say some
stupid shit, Shabby.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.648
What I know is, that buried deep inside
the forest is Young Hank's treasure.

14:37.413 --> 14:41.571
But it is impossible to get inside.
Because it's guarded by the vagabond

14:41.595 --> 14:43.159
with a messed up face.

14:46.951 --> 14:49.318
-You keep off! My guard
dog will rip you in half!

14:49.592 --> 14:52.708
-The Ax! The pick ax! I told you!
I told you!

15:01.569 --> 15:03.703
I said you were a bad influence.

15:03.991 --> 15:04.991
-You bet.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.020
-Perfect.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.629
Good...Good...

15:33.497 --> 15:34.497
Hold it up, son.

15:42.077 --> 15:43.483
Can't you do better than that?

15:44.913 --> 15:47.383
-Yes, sir.
-We can't hear you.

15:47.835 --> 15:48.835
-Yes, sir!

15:54.600 --> 15:57.219
-What is this?
-My flag, sir.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.389
Isn't it good?

16:01.404 --> 16:02.804
-It's more than good.

16:03.483 --> 16:04.483
I love it.

16:05.983 --> 16:08.116
It's professional. Look at this!

16:08.592 --> 16:10.446
In one word: Brilliant.

16:11.154 --> 16:12.154
Isn't it?

16:14.475 --> 16:15.475
Superlative!

16:17.985 --> 16:19.052
-Thank you, sir.

16:32.338 --> 16:33.405
-You see, class,

16:34.830 --> 16:35.830
we work hard

16:37.057 --> 16:38.250
we sow the soil,

16:38.947 --> 16:39.947
and tend the land

16:40.447 --> 16:42.689
where we become little
more than parasites.

16:43.799 --> 16:45.414
Like this little thief here.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.487
You're the lowest form of scum I have seen.

17:04.394 --> 17:08.775
-The homeland is glorious,

17:08.799 --> 17:12.674
the homeland is free,

17:14.182 --> 17:18.880
The homeland is (INDISTINCT)

17:19.032 --> 17:22.519
...the mountains to the seas.

17:23.666 --> 17:28.310
The many victories,

17:28.635 --> 17:33.098
the fruits of truth and unity,

17:33.362 --> 17:37.800
Our heart is a brotherhood,

17:38.026 --> 17:42.028
our song is liberty.

17:43.733 --> 17:47.779
The homeland is peaceful,

17:47.959 --> 17:52.313
the homeland is just.

18:32.837 --> 18:33.837
-Attention!

18:35.993 --> 18:36.993
Left!

18:37.618 --> 18:38.618
Left!

18:39.509 --> 18:40.509
Up!

19:41.903 --> 19:43.303
-Is your mother home?

19:45.286 --> 19:47.395
Didn't you hear me? I
asked you a question.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.393
-Yeah, she's taking a shower.

19:50.707 --> 19:51.707
-All right.

19:52.348 --> 19:53.815
We'll just come on in.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.154
-What are you doing here?

20:17.087 --> 20:18.087
Do you mind?

20:23.689 --> 20:24.903
-Nice to see you, too.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.649
Funny, I didn't seem to see
you in the crowd today.

20:29.517 --> 20:30.938
-I blend in.
-Oh.

20:32.908 --> 20:33.908
May I?

20:37.251 --> 20:38.806
-It's OK...
-Yeah...

20:38.993 --> 20:42.574
-We were just passing by, I thought
we'd drop in and say "Hi".

20:44.218 --> 20:46.015
Catch up with the little one here.

20:46.843 --> 20:48.412
Rumor has it he's a thief.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.505
What would you expect?

20:52.171 --> 20:54.974
His mommy is from a family of
undesirables and his daddy is

20:54.999 --> 20:57.662
a despicable traitor, you all
know what happened to him.

21:00.757 --> 21:01.757
Huh?

21:02.444 --> 21:03.444
What is this?

21:04.234 --> 21:05.639
You still haven't told your kid?

21:06.062 --> 21:07.466
-It's none of your business.

21:10.234 --> 21:11.234
-Hey, son,

21:13.244 --> 21:15.227
Where do you think your
father is right now?

21:16.486 --> 21:17.753
-He's away working.

21:20.830 --> 21:24.943
-Your... father is in a prison camp,

21:24.967 --> 21:28.061
far, far away

21:29.308 --> 21:31.761
and he won't be able to
take it for very long.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.090
-Djata...

21:52.721 --> 21:55.784
-You know, don't be surprised
if suddenly doing the simplest

21:55.809 --> 21:59.990
things, the things you take for
granted, becomes impossible.

22:01.030 --> 22:05.097
Because that's what happens with
traitor families like yours.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.577
-Are you OK?

22:43.499 --> 22:44.499
-I'm fine.

22:46.022 --> 22:47.622
-You have to understand.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.623
-No, no...

22:50.772 --> 22:52.507
-I was trying to protect you.

22:54.538 --> 22:55.538
Look at me.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.516
I wanted to protect you.

23:02.319 --> 23:03.319
-You lied...

23:05.874 --> 23:06.874
-Yeah...

23:08.030 --> 23:09.334
Yes...he...

23:10.174 --> 23:12.508
-You said he was working.
-I know.

23:15.563 --> 23:17.430
-You said he'd be back soon.

23:21.204 --> 23:23.381
I will never believe a word you say.

23:50.549 --> 23:51.549
-Djata...

23:53.002 --> 23:54.757
you know you can't
be out past curfew.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.603
Come to bed.

24:17.439 --> 24:18.638
Do you remember the rule?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.540
-Yeah. Don't accept any gifts.

24:24.908 --> 24:27.861
-You can play with whatever they give
you, but you have to leave it there.

24:28.650 --> 24:30.608
I won't let their gifts in the house.

24:36.849 --> 24:39.116
Ask them where your father is, OK?

24:40.380 --> 24:41.380
Come here.

25:04.697 --> 25:05.763
-You got so big.

25:06.798 --> 25:07.798
-Yes, sir.

25:15.471 --> 25:17.138
-Just call me "Grandpa".

25:57.022 --> 25:58.022
Get out!

25:59.373 --> 26:01.307
Cats are shitting everywhere.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.110
-Djata, hello.

26:04.322 --> 26:06.735
Wow, look who's tall!
-Yeah.

26:06.759 --> 26:07.869
-Hey...

26:10.143 --> 26:12.676
Your shoelaces are undone.
-Oh, yeah.

26:15.197 --> 26:17.017
-What do you expect with
a mother like that?

26:18.433 --> 26:21.112
I should have brought him to live
with us when we had the chance.

26:21.136 --> 26:22.413
-OK, off you go.

26:25.786 --> 26:27.137
-Here, Michael.

26:29.059 --> 26:30.059
Good Luck.

26:40.773 --> 26:41.773
-Sit down.

26:42.452 --> 26:43.452
There.

26:47.163 --> 26:48.163
Well.

26:49.648 --> 26:50.648
hmm?

26:51.718 --> 26:53.620
We're going to toast your birthday.

27:06.906 --> 27:07.906
Yeah...

27:09.742 --> 27:13.561
Hey there, whoa, whoa,
whoa, say "Hey there".

27:14.492 --> 27:15.492
-Hey there.

27:17.088 --> 27:18.155
-Happy birthday.

27:22.486 --> 27:23.486
Hmm...

27:26.127 --> 27:27.260
Well, I have a...

27:28.354 --> 27:29.954
a little surprise for you.

27:31.705 --> 27:34.238
Something you don't have to take home.

27:36.478 --> 27:37.745
Can you guess what it is?

27:45.443 --> 27:47.560
You're still playing football?
-Yeah.

27:49.724 --> 27:52.893
-How about Junior Defense?
-I start this September.

27:55.294 --> 27:56.294
-So soon?

27:57.482 --> 27:58.482
You excited?

27:58.763 --> 27:59.763
-Yeah.
-Good.

28:01.131 --> 28:02.464
Good, you should be.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.217
Now this,

28:07.021 --> 28:09.422
this hasn't seen the light
of day for thirty years.

28:12.178 --> 28:13.802
You have to be very careful with it.

28:15.076 --> 28:16.076
It's not a toy.

28:24.751 --> 28:26.915
Are you gonna finish this, huh?

28:31.555 --> 28:32.555
Hmm...

28:36.079 --> 28:38.453
Come on. Let's go.

28:41.935 --> 28:42.935
Come on!

28:47.841 --> 28:48.841
To the left!

28:49.998 --> 28:51.380
Hey! Hut!

28:54.439 --> 28:56.749
Here...you wanna feel the weight?

29:00.345 --> 29:02.704
Whoa, ha, ha, ha , whoa, whoa!

29:03.249 --> 29:06.583
You must never point a gun
at another human being.

29:08.062 --> 29:09.766
Unless you wanna kill
them, of course.

29:10.398 --> 29:13.807
Now, let's have a little practice here.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.151
Hmm? No, no.

29:19.929 --> 29:21.788
Two feet on the ground,
two feet on the ground!

29:22.492 --> 29:23.930
Alright. OK.

29:24.718 --> 29:25.976
Now, take aim.

29:28.688 --> 29:29.688
The tin can.

29:31.579 --> 29:32.579
Alright. Now...

29:33.376 --> 29:35.172
loosen your hand, put it under your wrist.

29:35.626 --> 29:37.292
Now, hold your breath

29:38.079 --> 29:39.079
Take aim,

29:39.485 --> 29:41.441
and...shoot.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.852
Ha ha ha! See?

29:44.290 --> 29:45.588
Easy as 1,2,3.

29:46.032 --> 29:49.313
Now, this is where it gets serious.

29:54.845 --> 29:55.845
It's loaded.

29:57.235 --> 29:59.013
Now you must be very, very careful.

30:00.352 --> 30:02.019
Only shoot when I say so.

30:03.181 --> 30:04.836
Alright. Now...take aim,

30:06.580 --> 30:07.713
hold your breath,

30:09.322 --> 30:12.722
Hey, look, look, look, look,
look, look, the enemy.

30:13.134 --> 30:14.134
Hmm?

30:15.322 --> 30:16.389
Shoot the enemy.

30:17.838 --> 30:19.395
Look,shoot it.

30:21.510 --> 30:22.510
I'm serious.

30:23.573 --> 30:24.706
Shoot the enemy.

30:26.565 --> 30:27.565
Come on!

30:33.259 --> 30:34.259
Kill it.

30:36.712 --> 30:37.712
Kill the cat.

30:41.681 --> 30:44.768
Come on...hold your
breath, pull the trigger.

30:45.782 --> 30:46.782
Kill it.

30:50.376 --> 30:51.376
Shoot!

30:58.075 --> 30:59.075
-I can't.

31:01.739 --> 31:03.205
-Hey, don't be scared.

31:04.496 --> 31:05.496
It's natural.

31:07.017 --> 31:08.217
We're all hunters.

31:10.345 --> 31:11.745
We live off the land.

31:16.681 --> 31:18.945
-See your sights and shoot.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Shoot!

31:25.232 --> 31:26.232
-Shoot!

31:27.615 --> 31:30.711
Ha ha ha! ha! You did it!

31:33.276 --> 31:36.504
Ah, come on, come on...

31:38.057 --> 31:40.433
-You deserve this...

31:41.799 --> 31:45.613
I know you were a bit scared just
pulling that trigger in the beginning,

31:45.638 --> 31:47.831
but, whoa, now you
feel great, don't you?

31:48.055 --> 31:51.215
-Yeah...
-You are so like your father.

31:51.891 --> 31:54.240
Don't you think?
-Yeah, he is.

31:55.219 --> 31:59.165
Yeah, he...he wasn't much of a
shooter at first, he had to practice,

31:59.189 --> 32:01.605
and practice, practice and practice

32:03.367 --> 32:04.767
but you're a natural.

32:10.265 --> 32:11.998
-They say dad's in a camp.

32:14.047 --> 32:15.647
Do you know where he is?

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
Do you know what he did?

32:18.383 --> 32:20.712
Mom says you must know something.
-Stop! No more.

32:28.992 --> 32:30.592
-You mustn’t ask us that.

32:31.398 --> 32:33.538
There's no point in talking
about these things.

32:34.015 --> 32:36.349
You see how it upsets your grandma?

32:37.524 --> 32:39.789
There is nothing ... we can do.

32:41.336 --> 32:42.506
Whether we want to or not.

32:48.237 --> 32:49.802
I've got something else for you.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.276
Don't worry...it's not a gift.

32:59.792 --> 33:00.792
It's a reward.

33:06.003 --> 33:07.669
Do you know what this is?

33:08.948 --> 33:12.354
When your father was the same age as
you, maybe a couple of months older,

33:13.080 --> 33:15.680
he won this, in a shooting competition.

33:17.236 --> 33:19.267
After that, he wore it 24/7.

33:20.142 --> 33:23.009
He wore it when he took his military exams,

33:23.768 --> 33:25.674
he wore it when he became a major.

33:27.307 --> 33:28.307
A major.

33:29.010 --> 33:30.010
At 25.

33:31.830 --> 33:37.135
He even... he even wore it
when he was taking the crap.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.443
Yeah, we always said it brought him luck.

33:43.127 --> 33:44.127
Huh...

33:47.362 --> 33:48.362
Come here.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.240
There.

33:57.599 --> 33:59.028
You have a great future ahead of you.

34:00.482 --> 34:02.149
You know that, don't you?

34:02.529 --> 34:03.529
-Yes, sir.

34:05.327 --> 34:06.327
-Oh!

34:08.616 --> 34:10.856
Oh, that woman.

34:12.098 --> 34:14.324
As fierce as the day I met her.

34:45.723 --> 34:46.723
-Surprise!

34:49.297 --> 34:50.578
Happy birthday!

34:53.587 --> 34:54.587
So how was it?

34:54.822 --> 34:56.382
-Yeah, it was good.
-Oh, good.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.033
Did you find anything out?
-No.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.610
-Nothing? Nothing at all?
-No, not really.

35:03.232 --> 35:05.423
-Did you ask?
-Yeah.

35:08.943 --> 35:10.477
-And they said nothing?

35:11.553 --> 35:12.553
-No.

35:13.326 --> 35:14.393
-Nothing at all?

35:14.842 --> 35:17.099
-Look, why don't you ask them yourself?
You're the adult.

35:17.772 --> 35:20.238
-You know I can't do that.
-Why not?

35:20.928 --> 35:22.128
-It's complicated.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.223
What's that you got there?

35:32.029 --> 35:33.362
Put it on the table.

35:35.271 --> 35:37.684
I said "Put it on the table".

35:43.515 --> 35:46.779
-It's not a gift. It's a reward!
-You broke the rule.

35:48.007 --> 35:50.274
We are not like your grandparents.

35:50.601 --> 35:52.401
We will never be like them.

35:52.648 --> 35:54.448
Do you understand me?
-No!

35:54.507 --> 35:56.339
-I am your mother and
you will listen to me.

35:56.374 --> 35:59.788
-They care about me!
-I will not have them brainwash you!

35:59.812 --> 36:01.812
-What are you going to do?
Lock me up?!

36:08.325 --> 36:09.459
-Go to your room!

36:16.400 --> 36:18.066
I'll get the night shift.

36:26.354 --> 36:28.422
-This is the weekend
productivity update.

36:28.963 --> 36:31.935
Serial output is
estimated to be up 23%.

36:32.302 --> 36:34.750
2.3 million tons up last month.

36:34.994 --> 36:40.301
While oil seed production is expected to
increase by 20% in the next three months.

36:40.986 --> 36:42.520
Glory to the home land.

36:46.057 --> 36:48.827
-You can touch it? Wanna touch it?
Yeah, here...

36:48.851 --> 36:51.146
Who wants to touch my ball?
Admit it.

36:52.092 --> 36:53.892
You love it, you love it...

36:54.475 --> 36:55.608
You want my ball.

37:01.574 --> 37:02.574
The twins.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.693
What do you want?

37:13.591 --> 37:15.363
-We wanted to bring you kids a treat.

37:16.216 --> 37:18.175
Caramels. See?

37:20.558 --> 37:22.391
Help yourselves, don't be scared.

37:31.972 --> 37:32.972
Good, isn't it?

37:42.847 --> 37:45.447
What's the matter?
Don't you want some?

37:50.386 --> 37:51.386
Open.

37:53.869 --> 37:55.335
-My dad will kill you!

37:56.009 --> 37:57.009
-Like this...

38:07.183 --> 38:08.783
-Empty your pockets.

38:10.659 --> 38:11.659
Come on.

38:14.347 --> 38:16.347
Go and get us some cigarettes!

38:17.274 --> 38:18.274
Run!

38:21.282 --> 38:22.282
-Next.

38:23.688 --> 38:25.355
-Give it back!
-Oh yeah!

38:25.696 --> 38:28.235
Why should we give it back?
-My dad gave it to me!

38:31.635 --> 38:32.761
What do you think?

38:33.409 --> 38:34.942
Shall we give this sad,

38:35.862 --> 38:36.862
sad boy,

38:37.471 --> 38:38.471
his ball back?

38:39.276 --> 38:41.369
-Nope. Ha ha ha ha!

38:43.589 --> 38:45.122
-That's enough, asshole.

38:53.016 --> 38:55.446
-Do you want to keep your
traitor daddy's ball?

38:55.470 --> 38:57.470
You're gonna have to fight us for it!
Oh no, turd!

39:02.947 --> 39:04.787
-I won't let you get away with this!

39:25.507 --> 39:26.507
-Next.

39:37.307 --> 39:39.673
-How are you, Gaby?
-Good.

39:39.899 --> 39:41.899
Thanks.
-How's the little one?

39:42.861 --> 39:46.207
-She was sad to miss the planes,
but she's much better now.

39:46.567 --> 39:47.834
Aren't you, Lauren?

39:47.858 --> 39:50.870
Anyway, it was nothing serious.
-Good.

39:50.894 --> 39:54.279
I'll get a loaf of bread
and some pork, thanks.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.463
Hey.

40:00.509 --> 40:02.080
-Sorry, I can't accept these.

40:03.822 --> 40:04.822
-What?

40:08.781 --> 40:10.818
-You no longer have buying privileges.

40:11.773 --> 40:13.439
-You got to be kidding...

40:14.281 --> 40:15.281
-I'm sorry.

40:18.739 --> 40:20.539
-They got to you, did they?

40:24.426 --> 40:26.871
I'm not leaving until I get what I need.
-Hey...

40:27.852 --> 40:29.195
Please don't make any trouble.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.732
-Please, we all have mouths to feed.

40:33.693 --> 40:35.832
-Surely we can give them some bread.
-No.

40:36.990 --> 40:37.990
-Gaby, please.

40:44.409 --> 40:45.582
Please...
-Come on, mom.

40:54.607 --> 40:58.366
-Just don’t... don't touch me!
-Please, Hannah. Don't make me call help.

41:06.612 --> 41:07.736
-Hey dump stick.

41:09.284 --> 41:11.315
-Oh, hi Mrs. Fitz.

41:12.876 --> 41:15.205
-Sebastian, get inside! Now!

41:17.017 --> 41:19.058
-Shabby's dad...
-Well, he's a coward.

41:20.251 --> 41:23.499
-But I'm hungry, mom.
-I'll find another store.

41:24.025 --> 41:25.025
OK?

41:27.877 --> 41:28.877
-Next!

41:41.782 --> 41:42.782
-Alright, OK.

42:04.912 --> 42:05.912
-Hey!

42:11.541 --> 42:12.541
Halt!

42:14.775 --> 42:15.821
Hey!

42:26.554 --> 42:28.545
-Hey, asshole!

42:32.327 --> 42:33.327
-What happened?

42:38.913 --> 42:40.307
-Declaration of War.

42:40.890 --> 42:42.948
Get your sorry asses
to the watchtower.

42:43.288 --> 42:45.755
Sunday at noon, and get ready to die.

42:46.015 --> 42:48.576
Sincerely, Remus Frunza

42:58.772 --> 42:59.772
-Hey!

43:04.241 --> 43:05.241
It's on.

43:21.845 --> 43:24.024
-Djata, let's go.

43:52.378 --> 43:53.378
-Boo!

44:02.165 --> 44:04.742
Look who it is...Djata.

44:04.985 --> 44:06.766
The traitor's son.
-I'm not!

44:06.790 --> 44:08.915
-So where's daddy, then?

44:10.311 --> 44:12.177
Tell me, when did you last see him?

44:13.053 --> 44:14.253
-What's it to you?

44:15.428 --> 44:18.625
-Our dad was a traitor, too, you know?
-They killed him.

44:20.623 --> 44:22.156
-I've come for my ball.

44:23.553 --> 44:25.599
-Take a seat.
-I don't want a seat!

44:25.623 --> 44:27.107
I want my ball!

44:29.076 --> 44:30.076
No!
-Sit!

44:31.875 --> 44:32.875
Ready?

44:36.578 --> 44:38.289
Is the ball ours?

44:42.070 --> 44:43.070
-No!

44:45.580 --> 44:47.155
-Are you sure, huh?

44:48.291 --> 44:49.291
-Yes!

44:51.884 --> 44:53.305
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

44:53.329 --> 44:55.728
-Is it ours? Is it ours?
-No!

44:55.752 --> 44:57.082
-Is it ours?
-No!

44:57.106 --> 44:58.665
-Is the ball ours?
-No!

44:58.689 --> 45:00.689
-Is it ours? Is it ours?
-No!

45:00.713 --> 45:02.442
-Is it ours? Is it ours?

45:06.921 --> 45:07.921
And now,

45:09.453 --> 45:10.453
is it ours?

45:13.874 --> 45:14.874
-No!

45:15.437 --> 45:16.437
-Hey! No!

45:23.193 --> 45:25.393
-Show me where.
-I don't know...

45:26.076 --> 45:27.076
-You're dead!

45:27.969 --> 45:29.236
I'm gonna kill you!

45:34.047 --> 45:35.047
Hey!

45:41.118 --> 45:42.118
Burn!

45:57.571 --> 45:58.571
-Guys! Guys!

46:00.297 --> 46:02.466
Dan. Dan! You're OK.
Come on, Dan.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.020
-Are you OK, mom?

47:00.809 --> 47:01.809
-Yeah.

47:06.449 --> 47:07.932
-It...it's not what
it looks like.

47:10.855 --> 47:11.987
-What does it look like?

47:19.091 --> 47:21.372
Be a good boy and go
do your homework, OK?

47:22.591 --> 47:25.258
Don't try wheezing out of it.
-I won't.

47:28.004 --> 47:29.004
-Look at you.

47:31.746 --> 47:32.879
I mean it, OK?

47:35.137 --> 47:36.804
-So you're not mad at me?

47:37.942 --> 47:38.942
-No.

48:30.774 --> 48:33.018
-Operator. Confirm your name.

48:34.274 --> 48:35.274
-Hannah Fitz.

48:37.252 --> 48:38.892
Connect me to Colonel
Michael Fitz.

48:45.948 --> 48:46.948
Hello?

48:49.107 --> 48:50.107
Hello?

48:51.732 --> 48:53.770
OK, if you picked up, then
at least say something.

48:56.138 --> 48:58.184
OK, I know you're there;
I can hear you wheezing.

49:00.747 --> 49:02.014
What's it gonna be?

49:04.260 --> 49:07.127
Don't you recognize the voice
of your own daughter-in-law?

49:07.940 --> 49:10.111
-I find your tone insulting.

49:10.995 --> 49:12.862
-Well, I also feel insulted.

49:12.885 --> 49:15.392
You know, you do well to
be less concerned about

49:15.417 --> 49:18.127
your honor and more concerned
about your son's life.

49:18.644 --> 49:20.760
-Oh, so that's why I have the pleasure?
-Yeah.

49:21.410 --> 49:23.953
Why else would I call? What
else do we need to discuss?

49:23.977 --> 49:27.125
-You know there's nothing we can do.
-That’s bullshit!

49:27.970 --> 49:29.436
Look, don't lie to me!

49:29.610 --> 49:31.469
I know you still have contact.

49:31.516 --> 49:34.966
You and your wife.
-Hannah, don't start.

49:36.344 --> 49:38.648
-Look, you can just give me
the name of someone, anyone.

49:38.672 --> 49:40.017
Anyone that can help.

49:40.681 --> 49:43.214
-The only thing that
we can do is wait

49:43.238 --> 49:45.238
and hope that...
-Wait?

49:45.262 --> 49:48.809
No. I'm not about to wait.
Why would I wait?

49:49.518 --> 49:52.112
I'm not waiting any longer.
Don't you get it?

49:52.642 --> 49:56.175
Why can't you do anything?
Anything to save your son?

49:56.884 --> 49:57.884
You prick!

50:12.557 --> 50:13.557
Help!

50:13.830 --> 50:14.830
Djata!

50:17.643 --> 50:18.643
I'm stuck!

50:20.229 --> 50:21.896
Be careful, don't rip it.

50:24.284 --> 50:25.971
OK, pull it down. pull,
pull, pull it down.

50:28.370 --> 50:29.370
OK.

50:29.765 --> 50:32.436
Go get yourself cleaned up and
put on your best clothes.

50:32.656 --> 50:35.606
We've got a long walk ahead.
What is this?

50:36.851 --> 50:39.422
There's a general that lives on
the other side of the river.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.775
We're gonna go there.

50:44.485 --> 50:45.485
We're gonna go there

50:46.415 --> 50:48.281
and we're gonna find out
where your father is

50:48.876 --> 50:50.961
and convince the general
to bring him home.

50:51.688 --> 50:53.719
Alright? Go.

51:04.242 --> 51:05.242
Come on.

51:29.117 --> 51:30.117
Thank you, sir.

51:38.580 --> 51:39.580
Djata.

52:12.481 --> 52:13.481
-Mom!

52:21.130 --> 52:22.530
-We have information!

52:44.264 --> 52:45.553
We're gonna do it, you know.

52:49.663 --> 52:50.663
-Cool!

53:05.255 --> 53:06.255
-Djata...

53:06.740 --> 53:07.740
come on.

53:16.724 --> 53:17.724
-Hello...

53:18.154 --> 53:19.154
-Hello General.

53:19.779 --> 53:20.779
-Meade.

53:21.576 --> 53:25.170
-Hannah Fitz.
-And look who you've bought.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.099
Come in.
-OK...

53:34.786 --> 53:38.594
-So, you're Colonel
Fitz's daughter-in-law.

53:39.278 --> 53:41.678
-You know him well.
-Oh, naturally.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.147
Such a hard worker.

53:44.458 --> 53:45.458
Funny,

53:46.372 --> 53:47.562
He never mentioned you.

53:49.350 --> 53:51.216
Or this charming little guy.

53:52.803 --> 53:55.187
Do we have a name?
-Djata.

53:55.936 --> 53:56.936
-Djata...

53:58.154 --> 53:59.154
help yourself.

54:06.747 --> 54:09.293
Hey there.
-Hey there.

54:17.178 --> 54:19.378
-You know, I do know who you are.

54:20.358 --> 54:22.851
And I can't imagine how
hard it's been for you.

54:23.194 --> 54:24.674
Both.
-Yeah.

54:25.600 --> 54:27.245
We've made inquiries everywhere.

54:28.701 --> 54:30.021
But it is always a dead-end.

54:30.264 --> 54:33.497
-Law enforcement is duty bound
not to diverge any details.

54:34.131 --> 54:36.198
It's a matter of public safety.

54:37.173 --> 54:39.051
-But Peter isn't a danger to anyone.

54:40.102 --> 54:42.072
His...only crime was speaking out.

54:42.766 --> 54:46.095
-We can't treat everyone else one way
and make an exception to your family.

54:46.205 --> 54:47.548
-I thought you might be
able to tell me where

54:47.573 --> 54:49.570
he's being held, or who
we have to talk to.

54:50.844 --> 54:52.908
-You didn't bring any information, did you?

55:00.171 --> 55:01.305
Mood light three.

55:05.273 --> 55:07.319
Huh...much more relaxing.

55:09.476 --> 55:10.476
Look,

55:11.687 --> 55:13.897
of course I know several
county governors,

55:15.140 --> 55:17.373
but I'd be really putting my
head on a line, you know.

55:17.397 --> 55:20.770
-Please, if you can find him, I would
do whatever I can to repay you.

55:22.245 --> 55:26.814
-How about you go into the garden and
play for a bit while we talk business?

55:27.440 --> 55:28.440
This way.

55:29.378 --> 55:33.952
Through the back door. We won't be long.
And keep your hands off my flags.

56:09.702 --> 56:10.702
-Whoah...

56:26.254 --> 56:27.254
-Go on, now.

56:32.025 --> 56:33.025
-Hello?

56:34.588 --> 56:36.121
Is there anybody there?

56:39.025 --> 56:40.980
I can hear you...

56:51.433 --> 56:52.433
Hello.

56:53.081 --> 56:54.081
Hello?

56:54.933 --> 56:56.133
-What's your name?

56:58.936 --> 56:59.936
-I'm Djata.

57:00.765 --> 57:01.765
-I'm Sophia.

57:05.007 --> 57:06.007
Hmm?

57:08.272 --> 57:09.272
Wanna play?

57:10.561 --> 57:11.561
-Yeah...

57:14.085 --> 57:15.152
-It's your turn.

57:19.304 --> 57:20.304
Ooh...

57:29.653 --> 57:32.119
-No...Stop!

57:33.575 --> 57:35.831
Stop it! Get off me!

57:36.333 --> 57:37.333
Get off me!

57:39.333 --> 57:40.333
-Get out!

57:45.208 --> 57:48.475
Why did I let you into my
house, you little shit?

57:52.576 --> 57:54.216
-No! Let me go!

57:58.209 --> 58:02.730
-You know, boys without fathers are
pittiable, the worst of the outside!

58:03.060 --> 58:04.060
-Screw you!

58:04.084 --> 58:06.926
-They're gonna string you up, just as
they are gonna string your father.

58:10.388 --> 58:11.588
-You win, general.

58:13.396 --> 58:14.789
-Right you are.

58:19.624 --> 58:20.690
Go see the moat.

58:25.038 --> 58:26.038
-Shit...

58:56.661 --> 58:58.598
The more we sell, the more we'll have.

59:01.278 --> 59:03.655
We're gonna bribe someone
to bring your father back.

59:06.833 --> 59:11.499
-Mom, what are you doing?
-We're gonna sell this on the black market.

59:14.966 --> 59:15.966
-No, wait!

59:16.583 --> 59:17.705
Not that!

59:17.728 --> 59:19.324
-No, Djata, we need this money.

59:19.348 --> 59:20.760
-Stop! Stop!

59:24.672 --> 59:26.139
Mom. it's gonna be OK.

59:35.117 --> 59:36.382
It's gonna be OK.

01:00:35.437 --> 01:00:37.437
Did you get the stuff?
-Yeah.

01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:38.542
It's gross.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.181
Djata?

01:00:54.322 --> 01:00:55.322
What's there?

01:00:57.337 --> 01:00:58.337
-I should go.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.264
-Crap!

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960
-Shabby!

01:01:14.954 --> 01:01:15.954
Shabby, wait!

01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.001
Wait! Hey!

01:01:20.672 --> 01:01:21.672
Shabby!

01:01:23.068 --> 01:01:24.459
Please be quick!

01:01:25.428 --> 01:01:26.561
Come on! Come on!

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:50.932
-Give me your hand.

01:02:02.034 --> 01:02:03.034
-We're here!

01:02:03.643 --> 01:02:04.643
Look!

01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:12.599
-Djata.

01:02:13.217 --> 01:02:16.050
-Yeah?
-It's getting dark.

01:02:38.914 --> 01:02:39.914
-This way.

01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:57.266
We found it!

01:02:58.164 --> 01:02:59.562
Whoa! We found it!

01:02:59.587 --> 01:03:02.099
Whoohoo, we found it, yeah!

01:03:02.123 --> 01:03:05.143
We found it! Whoohoo!

01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:07.167
Yeah!

01:03:08.741 --> 01:03:09.741
Huh?

01:03:10.611 --> 01:03:11.634
Just look at all of this!

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:37.556
-I've risked my life for this.

01:03:39.777 --> 01:03:40.777
I hate you.

01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:44.091
-No! No!

01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:45.793
-Get off me!

01:03:46.582 --> 01:03:47.582
Get off me!

01:03:49.816 --> 01:03:53.383
-Shabby, listen to me!
-No! you liar!

01:04:10.151 --> 01:04:11.151
-Djata?

01:05:11.187 --> 01:05:12.187
-You're awake.

01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:16.448
You have a concussion, but you'll be fine.

01:05:17.941 --> 01:05:19.277
-You're Pickaxe.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.928
-Here's some tea for you.

01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:34.304
I'm not gonna ask what you
were doing down there.

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.863
But it's not a place for kids.

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:41.390
Can you walk?

01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:45.945
-I think so.

01:05:50.056 --> 01:05:51.773
-It's OK, you can take a look around.

01:06:00.841 --> 01:06:01.841
Yes...

01:06:02.442 --> 01:06:04.042
I have seen better days.

01:06:13.828 --> 01:06:15.295
-What happened to you?

01:06:16.187 --> 01:06:17.767
-We all get offered a deal.

01:06:20.078 --> 01:06:21.078
Accept it.

01:06:23.695 --> 01:06:25.362
If not, you're a traitor.

01:06:34.566 --> 01:06:36.529
That's why they
destroyed my face.

01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:39.309
In a camp.

01:06:40.645 --> 01:06:42.579
After they were done with me,

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:47.543
they knew I'd make an ideal
guardian for their precious pit.

01:06:48.684 --> 01:06:50.563
For their dirty little secret.

01:06:52.927 --> 01:06:56.270
After all, who wants to talk to
someone with a face like this?

01:06:58.192 --> 01:06:59.192
-I do.

01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.419
My dad's in a camp.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:13.190
-You should meet Tank.

01:07:27.267 --> 01:07:28.267
Good boy.

01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:29.959
You're a good boy.

01:07:39.525 --> 01:07:42.098
What are you willing to give
to see your father again?

01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:45.743
-What would I... give?

01:07:48.605 --> 01:07:50.672
-We all have to lose something.

01:08:16.362 --> 01:08:17.362
Tank!

01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:55.051
-Where have you been, huh?
-I...

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.170
-Huh?!

01:08:58.685 --> 01:08:59.910
Get in the car. Come here.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:02.904
Get in the car!

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.093
Put your belt on.

01:09:15.522 --> 01:09:18.889
Your mother and I have been up
all night, searching for you.

01:09:19.803 --> 01:09:20.803
Huh?!

01:09:55.668 --> 01:09:56.668
Listen...

01:09:58.309 --> 01:10:00.957
all I ever wanted for your
father was a better life.

01:10:02.973 --> 01:10:04.639
I did everything I could.

01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:08.017
I made sacrifices for the Homeland.

01:10:10.298 --> 01:10:13.589
If Peter had stayed in the army,
he'd have had a better house,

01:10:13.613 --> 01:10:16.464
plenty of food, you'd have
gone to a better school...

01:10:17.196 --> 01:10:19.133
-My school's OK.
-Yeah...

01:10:21.526 --> 01:10:23.346
I warned him to hold his tongue,

01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:26.231
make smarter choices.

01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:32.276
Marry someone from a
more...appropriate family,

01:10:34.031 --> 01:10:35.562
but he chose his own path.

01:10:38.913 --> 01:10:41.580
Listen, I know you love him, believe me.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:45.554
We have done everything we can
to find him, to get him back,

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.473
but everyone turns their back on us.

01:10:49.929 --> 01:10:51.173
Even on me. Can you believe it?

01:10:57.984 --> 01:10:59.984
-Do you think dad's a traitor?

01:11:04.299 --> 01:11:05.833
The Homeland is cruel,

01:11:06.956 --> 01:11:07.956
unforgiving,

01:11:09.987 --> 01:11:10.987
stupid.

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:14.985
-But...

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:17.479
but you of...
-Fall's coming.

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:21.462
soon summer will be a forgotten dream.

01:11:36.196 --> 01:11:37.645
-Grandpa?
-Yeah?

01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:43.233
-There were things I saw
on the general's house.

01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:46.251
Incredible.

01:11:47.844 --> 01:11:49.140
Amazing things.

01:11:52.223 --> 01:11:53.223
-Now, listen,

01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:55.607
you and your mom,

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:58.267
you've got to get
away from here,

01:11:58.684 --> 01:12:02.551
across the border. Go
anywhere, anywhere but here.

01:12:03.898 --> 01:12:05.269
Swim the ocean if you have to.

01:12:06.726 --> 01:12:07.926
Do you understand?

01:12:09.484 --> 01:12:10.484
-Yeah.

01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:51.812
-Where have you been?
I looked everywhere.

01:12:53.813 --> 01:12:55.748
Are you OK?
-Yeah.

01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:58.610
I'm sorry, mom.

01:13:00.282 --> 01:13:01.282
-Thank you.

01:13:01.789 --> 01:13:03.723
-Well, I'm glad I could help.

01:13:04.594 --> 01:13:06.413
-Really? Thank you.

01:13:07.657 --> 01:13:08.723
-You're welcome.

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:23.719
-I love you, Grandpa!

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:39.018
Grandpa!

01:13:41.143 --> 01:13:42.610
Grandpa!
-Oh, my god!

01:13:42.634 --> 01:13:43.825
Oh my god!

01:13:45.381 --> 01:13:46.545
Help!

01:13:48.077 --> 01:13:49.077
Help!

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.701
Help!

01:14:16.662 --> 01:14:18.062
-How are you, Hannah?

01:14:18.608 --> 01:14:19.608
-OK.

01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:21.561
-Djata...

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:28.745
We all respected your
grandfather very much.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.980
-Yes we did.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.301
-Excuse me.

01:14:34.598 --> 01:14:35.910
-We should take our seats.

01:14:36.683 --> 01:14:37.683
-Djata...

01:14:39.512 --> 01:14:41.822
I'm scared, I shouldn't
have left, I'm sorry.

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:44.866
I'm really sorry.

01:14:48.147 --> 01:14:49.147
Are we still cool?

01:14:53.902 --> 01:14:55.102
-Yeah, we're cool.

01:15:08.948 --> 01:15:10.526
-These seats are reserved.

01:16:09.395 --> 01:16:11.261
-I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:16:11.707 --> 01:16:12.974
-Thank you so much.

01:16:30.908 --> 01:16:31.908
-Colonel...

01:16:32.978 --> 01:16:33.978
Michael...

01:16:34.203 --> 01:16:35.203
Fitz

01:16:37.383 --> 01:16:39.992
was a true... soldier

01:16:41.383 --> 01:16:43.073
who dedicated his life

01:16:44.336 --> 01:16:45.403
to the Homeland.

01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:50.374
He campaigned tirelessly for the

01:16:51.092 --> 01:16:53.929
independence of our great country,

01:16:55.303 --> 01:16:57.436
and he was present at its birth.

01:17:01.036 --> 01:17:05.836
You know, at the beginning, we were
just a... a young nature of dreamers

01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:08.476
We were naive,

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:13.558
but we were completely committed to the

01:17:14.448 --> 01:17:16.182
building of our new world.

01:17:18.028 --> 01:17:20.923
Then the colonel became part of an army

01:17:21.817 --> 01:17:24.684
that even today strives to

01:17:25.494 --> 01:17:29.740
protect our dreams so that we
could live freely and simply and

01:17:30.721 --> 01:17:34.645
closer to the nature that
we all love so much.

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:37.291
But he...

01:17:38.346 --> 01:17:42.358
always remained modest
and self-controlled.

01:17:44.049 --> 01:17:45.049
To the colonel,

01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:53.733
he believed in our core values, which
is that good will always triumph over

01:17:55.742 --> 01:17:57.206
vanity and...

01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.500
corruption.

01:18:01.882 --> 01:18:02.882
Even when...

01:18:03.843 --> 01:18:05.491
...he was betrayed by

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.258
his...one of those he loved.

01:18:10.735 --> 01:18:14.439
Such was the strength of hid conviction.

01:18:38.234 --> 01:18:40.796
But Michael was also my husband.

01:18:43.447 --> 01:18:47.181
And in our...private and family life,

01:18:48.955 --> 01:18:51.603
even until his last breath,

01:18:53.885 --> 01:18:55.616
he always maintained

01:18:57.877 --> 01:19:00.518
that we must make sacrifices today

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.613
for a greater tomorrow.

01:19:38.836 --> 01:19:39.836
-Move.

01:20:29.443 --> 01:20:30.776
-We got two minutes.

01:20:57.363 --> 01:20:58.363
-Peter...

01:21:08.559 --> 01:21:12.105
-Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:21:12.746 --> 01:21:13.746
-Peter!

01:21:14.309 --> 01:21:16.472
Oh my god, it's you!
-Dad...

01:21:17.817 --> 01:21:18.817
Dad...

01:21:19.598 --> 01:21:21.816
-Peter, look at me...I'm here...

01:21:24.074 --> 01:21:25.074
-Dad...

01:21:28.953 --> 01:21:30.686
-Look at me...hi...

01:21:30.763 --> 01:21:32.763
Look at me...come back tome...

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:34.787
Come back to me...

01:21:40.123 --> 01:21:41.123
-Dad...

01:21:45.279 --> 01:21:46.649
-Come on! Move!

01:21:46.998 --> 01:21:49.327
-I won't take orders from you!
You can drop dead!

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.237
Peter! Peter!

01:21:52.261 --> 01:21:54.261
-Hannah!
-Mom!

01:21:54.644 --> 01:21:56.644
-No! No!

01:21:56.668 --> 01:21:59.872
-I'm OK...
-No!

01:22:07.949 --> 01:22:09.549
-My father's a good dad!

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:19.066
-Wait!

01:22:30.907 --> 01:22:31.907
-Dad!

01:22:33.263 --> 01:22:34.263
Dad!

01:22:40.732 --> 01:22:41.732
-Djata!

01:22:59.685 --> 01:23:04.679
--The homeland is glorious,

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:09.230
the homeland is free,

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:17.450
Homeland stretches wide from
the mountain...to the sea...

01:23:18.242 --> 01:23:22.155
Our many victories

01:23:23.695 --> 01:23:27.270
the fruits of truth and unity,

01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:29.872
our hearts...
-Jada!

01:23:30.234 --> 01:23:32.234
are our brotherhood...
-Jada!

01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:35.968
Our soul is liberty.
