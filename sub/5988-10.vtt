00:00.001 --> 00:03.469
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Mary of Scots' closest friend,

00:03.471 --> 00:05.137
her lady Lola, has agreed

00:05.139 --> 00:06.305
to be your hostage,
in exchange

00:06.307 --> 00:07.506
for her family's release.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.208
I'm pregnant.
With your child.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.477
We must marry.
I am married,
Elizabeth.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.345
Then get a divorce.
We talked about
this option.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.414
Amy Dudley is dead.
Rumors are already spreading

00:15.416 --> 00:17.149
that Dudley
murdered his wife.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.351
We cannot be seen together.
You must help me

00:19.353 --> 00:20.686
to evade the gallows.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.754
What of our child?

00:21.756 --> 00:23.655
Are you sure? Our future...

00:23.657 --> 00:25.190
Nothing is certain
but my feelings for you.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.693
I'm marrying you off
to Duke Boinel,

00:27.695 --> 00:30.195
a wealthy noble who will
supply France with the gold

00:30.197 --> 00:32.131
she so desperately needs
in return for your hand.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.166
I was married once
to a girl I loved.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.300
She died in childbirth.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.435
And now Elizabeth has

00:36.437 --> 00:37.603
your little girl, doesn't she?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.438
She's using
your daughter

00:39.440 --> 00:41.573
to ensure that you
sabotage my alliances.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.643
¶ ¶

00:57.558 --> 00:59.591
(clock chimes)

00:59.593 --> 01:01.093
(door creaks)

01:01.095 --> 01:02.528
Good morning,
Your Majesty.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.532
May I come fetch your linens?
As you will.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.440
¶ ¶

01:21.215 --> 01:22.681
Will you require anything

01:22.683 --> 01:25.317
for your monthly pains,
Your Grace?

01:25.319 --> 01:27.453
No.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.321
I'll be all right.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.561
But tensions on the
Scottish border have been high

01:35.563 --> 01:36.728
for years,
Your Majesty.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.696
If your intention

01:37.698 --> 01:39.631
is to wait until that changes

01:39.633 --> 01:43.435
to deem whether it's safe
to free my father and brothers,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.237
they may never
be released,

01:45.239 --> 01:46.772
and I may never get to leave.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.308
Or is that,
in fact, the plan?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.344
The plan is for us to
get to know one another,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.313
my dear Lady Lola.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.415
A kind of personal diplomacy,
if you will.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.884
So that, in time, you
may report to my cousin

01:58.886 --> 02:01.820
I am not the monster
she may think I am.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.389
I would like to report that,
Your Majesty,

02:04.391 --> 02:06.692
and that you are a woman
of your word.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.729
But you suspect I am not.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.164
You've been treated
as an honored guest

02:12.166 --> 02:13.499
since your arrival.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.234
ELIZABETH:
I have enough

02:15.236 --> 02:16.768
Englishmen judging me
without adding

02:16.770 --> 02:18.637
a high-minded foreigner
to the list.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.472
You will return
to your chambers

02:20.474 --> 02:22.741
until I'm ready to
discuss the matter again.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.676
You may go.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.745
¶ ¶

02:29.383 --> 02:31.817
(bell tolls)

02:31.819 --> 02:33.819
MARY:
King Charles.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.421
I've been looking for you.
Do you have a moment?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.490
I'm waiting to talk
to my regent, Narcisse.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.658
How can I help you?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.660
It would mean a great deal

02:41.662 --> 02:43.662
if I could keep
hosting suitors here.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.432
I would make every effort
to ensure France benefits

02:47.434 --> 02:49.601
from any new alliance
Scotland makes.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.371
Beware of needy queens
asking for favors, Majesty.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.840
I'm not asking for myself.
Scotland is an ally of France.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.808
Alliances generally
benefit both countries.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.243
If you are talking about

02:58.245 --> 02:59.912
the costs of the war...
Exorbitant costs,

02:59.914 --> 03:03.248
in blood and treasure,
borne by France.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.886
Which is what King Charles
invited me here to discuss--

03:07.888 --> 03:09.521
French business.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.822
Majesty,

03:10.824 --> 03:11.790
shall we?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.859
Yes. Yes.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.602
There's something
you need to see.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.871
It's from Lola.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.843
Your brother's Scottish war
left us with crushing debts.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.345
And if we raise taxes?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.980
Oh, that would make us both
very unpopular

03:34.982 --> 03:37.549
just as we are starting
our time in power.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.818
No, our options are few.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.920
Especially as you have
only so many sisters

03:41.922 --> 03:44.556
to marry off to suitors
willing to pay so richly.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.991
About that.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.794
My sister and mother are
dead set against the marriage.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.796
I know your mother
has made promises, Majesty,

03:50.798 --> 03:53.365
but take my word--
Claude will be lucky

03:53.367 --> 03:55.634
to have Duke Boinel
as her husband.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.768
Well...

03:56.770 --> 03:59.538
even if he is a bit her senior.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.939
But is he a good man?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.775
Our wives were once friends,
and they spoke

04:03.777 --> 04:04.876
very candidly
with each other.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.612
She said he always treated her

04:06.614 --> 04:08.847
with the greatest
of kindness and respect.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.550
And when she died,
along with my wife,

04:11.552 --> 04:13.018
in one of the summer plagues,

04:13.020 --> 04:16.722
she left him one of
the largest estates in France.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.891
He is as good as his gold,
which we happen

04:19.893 --> 04:21.727
to need very much.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.296
I understand why
you're angry, Mary,

04:24.298 --> 04:25.797
but now may not
be the best time

04:25.799 --> 04:26.965
to confront the
English ambassador.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.767
You read Lola's letter.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.502
I'm not leaving her stranded
in England indefinitely.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.404
And I don't think
there is a good time

04:32.406 --> 04:33.605
to accuse the English queen

04:33.607 --> 04:35.607
of imprisoning one
of my best friends.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.643
Well, that's what I'm
trying to tell you.
Shh.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.944
Juliet, what is it?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.046
They're arguing.
LEITH: A plan.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.748
A plan for what?
To have me live here?

04:42.750 --> 04:43.949
LEITH:
To see your daughter.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.285
Stay here in France--
for how much longer?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.819
I see why you say
it's not the best time

04:47.821 --> 04:49.488
to confront him,
but what choice do I have?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.923
I will not stand by
and do nothing

04:51.925 --> 04:53.058
to defend my few
remaining friends.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.793
Mary, there was
something else

04:54.795 --> 04:56.828
in those letters of Gideon's
we intercepted.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.664
Have you managed
to break the code?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.299
It took time,
but this morning,

05:00.301 --> 05:01.967
we finally managed
to rebuild their cipher.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.736
What we found in those
letters may upset you,

05:04.738 --> 05:06.772
but if used properly,
it could change the whole game.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.007
What is it?
SERVANT:
Your Grace.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.609
Lord Narcisse
has requested

05:10.611 --> 05:11.877
you join him
in the great hall.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.011
Of course.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.414
Now he suddenly wants to see me?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.049
Stop saying you have
no choice, Charles.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.684
You're the king.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.885
That's right,
I'm the king.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.020
I'm a royal, and none of us
marry for love.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.056
It's a miracle
Francis loved his wife,

05:24.058 --> 05:25.891
but that doesn't mean
any of us will.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.527
So, that's it?
I'm to be sold off like a mule,

05:28.529 --> 05:29.861
forced to
live far away

05:29.863 --> 05:31.463
with some fossil
I don't even know?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.798
Narcisse swears

05:32.800 --> 05:34.366
the duke is a good man.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.735
As good as his gold,
which I'm sorry to say

05:36.737 --> 05:37.836
we need very much.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.471
Those are Narcisse's
words all right.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.739
I've heard
them myself.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.873
Claude, I'm sorry.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.008
I've made my
decision.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.543
(shrieks)

05:44.545 --> 05:46.111
Mary, what are you doing here?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.746
I was wondering
that myself.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.948
Narcisse sent word, but...

05:49.950 --> 05:53.051
I wanted you all here
to answer a simple question.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.653
Where is the gold

05:54.655 --> 05:56.588
that Duke Boinel paid
to marry Claude?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.090
What? Someone's stolen it?

05:58.892 --> 06:00.959
(scoffs)

06:00.961 --> 06:02.861
Are you accusing
my mother of this?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.963
NARCISSE: Well, we all know
that she opposed the marriage,

06:04.965 --> 06:07.733
and she would love nothing more
than to see my regency fail.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.502
And what better way to do that
than starve the kingdom of funds

06:10.504 --> 06:12.371
when we need them
the most?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.506
Mother, is there
any truth to this?

06:14.508 --> 06:17.876
I oppose Claude's marriage
to Narcisse's friend, the duke,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.812
absolutely, and the rest
is amateur fiction.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.749
Amateur is whoever you paid
to commit the crime.

06:23.751 --> 06:27.486
They took the gold right after
Boinel signed it over to me.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.554
That means the deal
is done.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.590
The marriage will go ahead
as scheduled.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.493
And when I find the
gold-- which I will--

06:34.495 --> 06:37.028
your plan will have
utterly failed.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.131
Is it so unthinkable
a crime might take place

06:39.133 --> 06:42.000
in this castle
that I had no hand in?

06:42.002 --> 06:45.504
Hear me, Mother, if there
is one shred of evidence

06:45.506 --> 06:47.606
that you stole that gold,
you'll be punished severely.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.941
The same goes for
you, as well.
Me?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.777
You two have been as thick
as thieves lately.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.445
MARY: Do you still
hold it against me

06:53.447 --> 06:57.048
that I defended her against
a false accusation of murder?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.117
You have both been warned.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.491
Look at my son.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.094
The king is
following his regent

07:09.096 --> 07:11.430
like an acolyte
follows his master.

07:11.432 --> 07:15.767
I'm losing him, Mary,
to a man who cannot be trusted

07:15.769 --> 07:18.770
with Charles's welfare
or this family's.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.046
(grunting)

07:34.054 --> 07:36.488
Ambassador Gideon.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.490
You look like a man
working out his frustrations.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.058
Perhaps I should
take a swing,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.160
as we are both frustrated
with the same queen.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.795
Don't know what you mean.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.498
Well, first Elizabeth holds
your daughter hostage,

07:46.500 --> 07:47.799
and then she keeps
changing the price

07:47.801 --> 07:49.234
on the little girl's freedom.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.802
Do you remember
how we found

07:50.804 --> 07:53.071
your daughter Agatha's
letters to you?

07:53.073 --> 07:54.573
We found other
letters as well.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.074
Of course you did.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.909
That's why we change ciphers
routinely.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.111
My cryptographers finally
deciphered the letters.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.647
Including several from
Elizabeth to you.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.684
Ordering you to seduce me.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.654
Your cryptographers
are breathing

08:09.656 --> 08:11.156
too much of their own ink.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.891
They're imagining things.

08:12.893 --> 08:17.562
And letters from her
to your aide, Jeffrey,

08:17.564 --> 08:21.266
ordering him
to watch her every move.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.002
I can show you,
if you need proof,

08:24.004 --> 08:27.038
but I don't think
you do.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.241
If Elizabeth had to
ransom your daughter

08:29.243 --> 08:31.610
to guarantee
that you would obey her,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.245
why would she trust you
without supervision?

08:33.247 --> 08:34.579
Let it go, Mary.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.083
(grunting)

08:38.085 --> 08:39.784
You are angry now
because you know

08:39.786 --> 08:41.753
that your mission
is doomed to fail.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.656
Why would I let you seduce me
when I know the truth?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.558
Elizabeth will keep
withholding your daughter.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.893
That's enough.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.294
If you're finished.

08:49.296 --> 08:53.665
Unless I decide
to let you seduce me.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.236
Because it gets us both
what we want.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.171
What are you talking about?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.542
Jeffrey's letters say
that he is returning

09:03.544 --> 09:05.644
to England soon.
Let him bring news

09:05.646 --> 09:07.946
to Elizabeth that I am
the lonely, brokenhearted queen

09:07.948 --> 09:10.649
she thinks I am
and that you have seduced me.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.150
Convince her
that you control me,

09:12.152 --> 09:14.819
and you'll have something
to bargain with,

09:14.821 --> 09:16.788
to force her
to let you see Agatha.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.558
You said this would give us both
what we want.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.892
What does it give you?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.594
You're not the only one

09:22.596 --> 09:24.129
Elizabeth has broken
promises to.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.898
I have few enough weapons
at my disposal.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.234
I plan to use this one
to ensure Elizabeth

09:29.236 --> 09:31.136
keeps her promise to me.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.606
Tomorrow? Already?

09:34.608 --> 09:35.907
Why is it happening so fast?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.876
They know I don't want to marry.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.245
That's why they've chosen to
have a small, private ceremony--

09:40.247 --> 09:43.848
so I don't embarrass the
family with my objections.
I'm so sorry.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.350
This shouldn't be happening.
You should be marrying

09:45.352 --> 09:48.286
someone who knows you,
someone who loves you.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.723
Someone like me.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.158
To hear you say that,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.760
to hear it now...

09:58.599 --> 10:00.065
DUDLEY: I brought you
more pigs' blood.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.733
Don't worry, nobody
saw me come in.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.902
I don't know how much longer
I can keep up this charade.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.004
My pregnancy
isn't showing yet,

10:06.006 --> 10:07.172
but it will.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.711
I've sent letters to suitors
around the continent,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.946
but it may take weeks for them
to consider and respond,

10:14.948 --> 10:17.215
and by then,
it might be too late.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.050
I'll be forced to admit
to my future husband

10:19.052 --> 10:21.119
I'm already carrying
someone else's child.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.288
I keep asking myself
if there's any chance

10:23.290 --> 10:24.723
for you to be cleared,

10:24.725 --> 10:26.625
exonerated beyond
any doubt of a role

10:26.627 --> 10:28.627
in your wife's death.
It will never happen, Elizabeth.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.629
I'm being brought
before a tribunal--

10:30.631 --> 10:32.030
a tribunal stacked with nobles

10:32.032 --> 10:33.965
who whisper the same thing
that the people do:

10:33.967 --> 10:36.234
that our rumored love for
each other killed my wife.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.103
If I hang,
which I probably will,

10:38.105 --> 10:39.638
then maybe I deserve it.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.040
Because the truth is that
I did wish my wife dead.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.376
And I would have killed for you.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.277
For our child.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.748
I have to go.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.083
There are guards waiting for me.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.786
(door opens, shuts)

10:54.788 --> 10:57.756
(dog barks, horse whinnies)

10:57.758 --> 11:00.225
(men laughing)

11:01.261 --> 11:02.360
Steady, Percy.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.728
MAN:
Look at you!

11:03.730 --> 11:05.397
(laughing)

11:05.399 --> 11:07.432
Ooh!
Whoa!

11:07.434 --> 11:10.035
You see, now people will think
we've been drinking.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.836
(laughter)

11:13.006 --> 11:15.674
MARTIN:
Well, now.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.877
Does the owner always
pour drinks like a barmaid?

11:18.879 --> 11:21.079
It's good to see you.
Martin.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.014
I had no idea
you'd come ashore.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.016
Come here, Greer.
Give us a kiss.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.785
Whoa.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.019
Wait a minute.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.055
You're pregnant.
Shh.
No one knows.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.858
The child is mine?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.829
Were you planning
to tell me this?
How?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.764
By writing you a letter?

11:39.766 --> 11:42.000
What address would I use? "The
middle of the Mediterranean"?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.168
I could help you with this.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.937
Martin, that's very kind,

11:45.939 --> 11:48.173
but I've already arranged
to give the child

11:48.175 --> 11:49.708
to a loving family.
You don't want it?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.042
Of course I want it.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.478
But I also want...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.346
I want what's best
for the child.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.915
And you think that's best?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.349
Better than growing up
the bastard child

11:58.351 --> 11:59.851
of a pirate and a
peddler of whores.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.386
You think we would be
such terrible parents?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.322
How can you
be a parent?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.724
You don't even
live here.

12:05.726 --> 12:06.858
You don't
live anywhere.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.827
I can send gold.
And I can visit.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.261
Really?

12:10.263 --> 12:11.796
How often?

12:11.798 --> 12:13.798
Twice a year, perhaps?
Maybe more?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.734
It's an honest offer.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.435
You do what you want,

12:17.437 --> 12:18.970
but make me one promise:

12:18.972 --> 12:21.506
Choose because of
what you think,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.808
not what others might.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.748
(bells tolling)

12:29.750 --> 12:31.116
CARDINAL:
For richer and for poorer,

12:31.118 --> 12:32.817
in sickness and in health,

12:32.819 --> 12:34.285
until death do us part.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.822
Princess Claude,

12:37.824 --> 12:39.891
I need you to
repeat after me.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.459
I'm sorry.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.495
I wasn't listening.
Oh, dear Lord.

12:43.497 --> 12:46.798
Cardinal Lauren, perhaps
you could abbreviate
the proceedings?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.833
This is a holy
covenant between...
I do.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.303
I, Claude de Valois,

12:52.305 --> 12:55.273
take Duke Boinel as my husband.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.276
That will do, Cardinal.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.547
You have declared your consent
before the Church.

13:02.549 --> 13:06.451
What God has joined,
let no man divide.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.921
We should arrive at
my estate before nightfall.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.056
It's quite beautiful
in the twilight hours.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.058
I think you'll be
very happy there.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.360
I'm sure it's lovely.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.465
¶ ¶

13:46.993 --> 13:49.027
(indistinct conversations)

13:52.532 --> 13:55.967
You're kind to keep
feeding me beer,

13:55.969 --> 13:58.837
although alcohol
can't fix this.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.905
But it might help you forget.
Now that she's married.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.975
It's not Claude
I need to forget.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.878
I need to forget an idea.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.347
A ridiculous,
childish idea

14:09.349 --> 14:11.449
that I could love someone,
they could love me,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.284
and nothing else mattered.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.253
Don't let go of that idea.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.091
Sons of goatherds don't get
to be with princesses.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.260
But look how far you've come.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.195
You got out of the kitchens.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.564
You rose up to the kingsguard,
and you'll go higher still.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.433
You used to be such a realist.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.935
What happened to you?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.937
I suppose

14:32.939 --> 14:36.140
I've come to believe that...

14:36.142 --> 14:39.911
I need to believe

14:39.913 --> 14:43.081
that who we are matters more
than our station.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.582
Well, I've come around
to your old way

14:44.584 --> 14:45.917
of thinking,

14:45.919 --> 14:48.019
because it was right, Greer.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.954
You are who you're born to.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.557
You'll never be more than
what people say that you are.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.958
You can pretend otherwise,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.660
but the world
won't pretend with you.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.630
¶ Say to me ¶

14:58.632 --> 15:00.899
¶ I am yours ¶

15:02.936 --> 15:06.537
¶ I am yours. ¶

15:07.540 --> 15:09.374
Mm, we have to hurry.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.009
Juliet is signaling.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.644
Jeffrey is in
position to watch

15:12.646 --> 15:15.013
our secret rendezvous.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.015
Has he already seen your
love letters to me?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.950
He has read them.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.385
But this is only
going to work

15:20.387 --> 15:22.020
if he sees us together.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.121
Now hurry.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.624
(gasps)

15:27.694 --> 15:28.993
Where's Jeffrey?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.396
MARY:
Well, don't look.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.563
We don't want
him to realize

15:32.565 --> 15:34.032
that you know he's there.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.533
Now sit.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.602
We're enjoying a meal together.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.604
Shouldn't you,
perhaps, be smiling?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.706
You're supposed to be
enchanted by my company.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.042
I think I'm doing pretty well
for a queen who used

15:44.044 --> 15:45.543
to rule two realms and is
now barely holding onto one.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.078
Huh.
A queen who
is reduced

15:47.080 --> 15:49.614
to playacting
for someone else's servant

15:49.616 --> 15:51.449
to convince him that
she's lost her foolish heart

15:51.451 --> 15:53.084
to a spy and a fraud.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.386
If only for Jeffrey

15:55.388 --> 15:56.955
but also for you,

15:56.957 --> 15:59.590
Mary, sit down

15:59.592 --> 16:01.326
and breathe.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.664
It's going
to be all right.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.599
I'll get my daughter,
and Lola will be released.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.468
If not this way,
we'll find another.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.036
I do want to believe you.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.306
But so many things have been
going wrong lately.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.208
For me,
for my country...

16:17.210 --> 16:20.044
I just don't know if
I trust my own fate anymore.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.646
I don't know...

16:21.648 --> 16:23.181
(gasps)

16:25.452 --> 16:27.051
(thunder rumbles)

16:27.053 --> 16:28.653
(sighs)

16:28.655 --> 16:30.088
(chuckles)

16:30.090 --> 16:31.155
You have to admit,

16:31.157 --> 16:32.490
your fate has a sense of humor.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.758
(sighs loudly)

16:33.760 --> 16:35.994
We have to
get inside.
Right.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.228
Ugh.
Bring the wine!

16:37.230 --> 16:38.563
Ah... Uh-huh.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.034
We have to get to a window.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.369
He'll be able
to see us from there.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.636
We should get
to the kiss quickly

16:45.638 --> 16:47.638
before the building
collapses

16:47.640 --> 16:49.707
under the weight
of my misfortune.
Shall we sit
at this window seat?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.476
Yes, but you've got to be
in the right position...

16:51.478 --> 16:53.144
Mary!

16:56.116 --> 16:57.682
Is this yours?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.517
No, you wouldn't have told me
to sit here if so.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.786
Do you know who...?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.125
Do you think that was
enough to convince him?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.226
Um...

17:08.228 --> 17:09.594
No.
No.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.229
Maybe... more.
More. Um...

17:11.231 --> 17:12.497
Less impulsive...
Mmm.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.565
...more deliberate.
I will instigate

17:14.567 --> 17:17.301
to show that I've
fallen for you.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.636
Um...

17:35.789 --> 17:37.822
Uh...

17:37.824 --> 17:39.457
well done.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.792
All right.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.427
Elizabeth will hear of this,

17:42.429 --> 17:44.162
and she will know
it was a success.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.363
You've seduced me,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.098
you've won my heart.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.599
And, uh...
well, then.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.172
Oh, as if I don't have
enough problems, Catherine,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.707
you give me
the duke's stolen gold.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.776
(thunder rumbles)

17:58.778 --> 18:01.546
My wife's personal affects can
be unpacked at a later time.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.420
Do you still
have nothing

18:09.422 --> 18:10.688
to say to your husband?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.390
Sorry.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.126
It's been a long day for me.
For you?

18:15.128 --> 18:18.129
You forced me to stand
at the altar while you grieved.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.530
It was appalling.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.466
Your family was
right to hide you.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.433
You're an embarrassment.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.469
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:24.471 --> 18:28.272
I... I wasn't trying
to make you uncomfortable.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.876
You humiliated me.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.311
And to think
I paid dearly for this.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.645
A wife who cost
as much as you

18:34.647 --> 18:35.880
should be better behaved.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.150
You will apologize.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.153
Are you serious?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.499
How dare you?!

18:54.501 --> 18:55.900
It's bad enough
you're old and dull,

18:55.902 --> 18:57.785
but you're a wife-beater, too?

18:57.786 --> 18:59.669
Have you any idea how lucky
you are to be married to me?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.772
This is not how you treat
the royal blood of France!

19:01.774 --> 19:03.541
(gasping for air)

19:05.578 --> 19:08.613
I'm a princess!

19:16.923 --> 19:18.422
MARY:
<i> Set that down anywhere,</i>
<i> Timothy.</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:23.161
Thank you, Timothy.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.630
You may go.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.369
Clearly, you're not
surprised to see this gold.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.871
Do you have any idea
what this could have done to me?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.373
Catherine,
you know

19:35.375 --> 19:38.242
that I am in a weak
position politically,

19:38.244 --> 19:40.311
already unwelcome
at Narcisse's court...

19:40.313 --> 19:41.345
I know and I'm sorry.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.346
It's not just my comfort

19:42.348 --> 19:43.414
that's at stake here!

19:43.416 --> 19:45.750
As long as I am at French court,

19:45.752 --> 19:47.451
I am seen as an
ally of France.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.288
That and the Pope's support
are all I have left

19:50.290 --> 19:52.323
to fend off Elizabeth

19:52.325 --> 19:55.226
and to fight the rebels who are
trying to snatch my crown!

19:55.228 --> 19:56.427
The rebels that I am fighting

19:56.429 --> 19:57.795
have not only stolen my crown,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.330
they're starting
to pick off my children.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.766
Charles has been
seduced by Narcisse

20:01.768 --> 20:04.202
and Claude has been married off.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.704
Is it not possible that Narcisse
is just trying to do his job?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.307
Do you honestly think that,
having held power,

20:09.309 --> 20:12.944
that Narcisse and his friends
will surrender it willingly

20:12.946 --> 20:14.645
when my son
comes of age?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.314
Make no mistake:

20:16.316 --> 20:19.350
a movement will rise
to make Narcisse king,

20:19.352 --> 20:21.485
and their first task

20:21.487 --> 20:23.287
will be to cut off the heads

20:23.289 --> 20:25.389
of every last Valois child.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.891
So to safeguard
your children's lives,

20:26.893 --> 20:28.593
you gambled mine.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.261
I tried and I failed

20:30.263 --> 20:31.796
to stop Claude's marriage
the only way I could.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.564
I knew that Narcisse

20:33.566 --> 20:34.966
would look to me first
for the gold.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.934
When I needed
a place to hide it,

20:36.936 --> 20:39.270
your chambers were the closest
I could visit

20:39.272 --> 20:41.572
without arousing suspicion.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.409
Well, thank you,
for the truth at last.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.744
You now have your gold,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.579
and whatever you plan
to do with it...
I...

20:48.581 --> 20:51.382
...which I don't
want to know--

20:51.384 --> 20:53.251
I hope your reasons are good.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.921
(goat bleats, chickens cluck)

20:56.923 --> 20:58.923
(indistinct conversations)

20:58.925 --> 21:01.292
(laughter)

21:01.294 --> 21:02.393
Ellen.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.661
Sister.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.863
So good to see you.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.333
My husband,
Lord Thomas Campbell.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.669
Good to finally
meet you.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.671
I thought you were
further along.

21:13.673 --> 21:17.275
I've made mine too big, and-and
the silly rags keep falling out.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.376
No, no, it's
perfect.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.378
Let's sit down.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.013
You'll live in
a nearby estate

21:22.015 --> 21:24.715
that I've rented
under Thomas' name.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.384
If you make a few
appearances at French court,

21:26.386 --> 21:28.052
show off your
pregnancy,

21:28.054 --> 21:30.621
no one should suspect the
child is mine and not yours.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.057
But where will you be
while your belly grows?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.793
Here, where I can hide
if I need to.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.561
THOMAS:
This estate you've rented.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.397
Is it befitting a family
of our good name?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.799
It belonged to a wealthy earl.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.402
You'll be quite comfortable.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.872
Why don't you sample some
of Greer's ale, Thomas?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.377
Sorry about Thomas.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.613
After we lost the money
for our dowries

21:55.615 --> 21:57.448
that your husband had promised,

21:57.450 --> 22:00.618
Father was happy to marry
us off to anyone with titles.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.887
Titled men have
such ridiculous pride,

22:02.889 --> 22:05.423
even when they haven't got
a penny to their names.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.427
Thomas doesn't understand

22:09.429 --> 22:11.095
why we can't raise
the child in Scotland.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.997
I want the child
growing up close to me.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.366
He or she will believe that
you are its mother, but...

22:15.368 --> 22:17.535
Won't that be painful for you?

22:17.537 --> 22:18.969
Not as painful
as never seeing it.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.404
Mmm.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.839
What is it?

22:21.841 --> 22:22.873
What's wrong?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.875
I suppose we feel...

22:24.877 --> 22:27.878
Here you are, about to lie
to your friends at court

22:27.880 --> 22:30.648
to hide your pregnancy
and hide your motherhood.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.650
It feels as if we're all paying
for your mistakes.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.051
My mistakes?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.053
I lost everything.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.055
And, yes, I got pregnant

22:38.057 --> 22:40.725
in a moment of loneliness
and thoughtlessness,

22:40.727 --> 22:41.992
for which I am paying.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.828
I'm paying your expenses.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.731
I'm giving you the child you
weren't able to have on your own

22:46.733 --> 22:50.368
whilst you live in a house
your husband can't afford.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.871
And here's what I and this
child's father expect to get:

22:53.873 --> 22:56.874
our child raised the way you
and I should have been raised.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.077
The world may continue to
care who one's parents are,

23:00.079 --> 23:03.581
but our child will not.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.982
They will grow up knowing

23:04.984 --> 23:07.985
there are more important
things in this life.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.421
And if this child doesn't
learn that from you,

23:10.423 --> 23:13.858
I will be there to make damn
sure they learn it from me.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.703
Shopping for toys for
your daughter, are you?

23:25.705 --> 23:28.773
Have you heard
something from England?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.474
Well, the queen
is happy, yes.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.411
Seems Jeffrey reported
our... evening together.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.980
Oh.
Now Elizabeth's
considering dates

23:35.982 --> 23:38.716
when I might be allowed
to travel home.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.052
Gideon, that's wonderful
news, isn't it?

23:42.054 --> 23:43.988
You'll be able to see
your daughter again.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.190
And you can help
my friend, Lady Lola.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.725
"Considering,"
Elizabeth says.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.960
I "might be" allowed
to come home?

23:49.962 --> 23:52.196
These are the same vague
promises I've heard for years.

23:52.198 --> 23:55.199
So she acts as though
she's keeping her promise

23:55.201 --> 23:58.035
just by admitting
she made one.
Mmm.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.438
How many lies and deceits does
she expect people to accept?

24:00.440 --> 24:02.139
In my case, not many more.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.707
I'm at my limit, Mary.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.109
If I don't see my daughter soon,

24:05.111 --> 24:07.178
I feel I may lose my mind.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.596
¶ ¶

24:46.552 --> 24:48.686
(door opens)
WILLIAM: Majesty.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.187
Have you any news?

24:50.189 --> 24:51.655
Have we heard from Sweden?

24:52.758 --> 24:53.991
From Austria?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.092
It's not what you hoped.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.562
Suddenly no one wants
to marry me.

24:58.564 --> 25:02.099
People are suspicious, Majesty,
after so many spurned proposals.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.868
Perhaps if
you told me

25:03.870 --> 25:06.871
why marriage was
suddenly so important.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.839
The queen changed
her mind.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.841
How about that?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.576
But if I am
to explain

25:12.578 --> 25:14.545
your policy shift
to prospective suitors...

25:14.547 --> 25:18.549
Perhaps I realized
you were right all along.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.551
And for the future,
please tell Dudley

25:20.553 --> 25:22.186
he cannot come
and go undetected,

25:22.188 --> 25:24.105
as he seems
to think.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.023
If I thought I'd see him
again, I would tell him.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.758
Now leave me.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.766
(door closes)

25:41.541 --> 25:44.275
¶ ¶

25:48.214 --> 25:50.681
Narcisse.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.982
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't mind,

25:51.984 --> 25:54.251
but we took the liberty
of searching your chambers,

25:54.253 --> 25:56.287
which are our chambers
after all,

25:56.289 --> 25:57.655
loaned to you as our guest.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.557
Did you find
what you were looking for?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.598
NARCISSE: You don't
know the hand, perhaps,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
but you do know
the man it belonged to.

26:09.602 --> 26:13.137
Timothy, castle servant who
tended to you from time to time.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.205
Timothy tried to spend
a gold coin in the village.

26:15.207 --> 26:18.842
My men had told the merchants
to look out for such coins,

26:18.844 --> 26:21.045
ones bearing
Duke Boinel's markings.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.713
So this servant stole
the duke's gold?

26:22.715 --> 26:25.716
"This servant" that you
pretend not to know

26:25.718 --> 26:27.685
was on his way to me
for questioning.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.720
Is that when you
cut off his hand?

26:29.722 --> 26:31.855
No, his hand was cut off
by the village magistrates

26:31.857 --> 26:33.857
for stealing Crown property.

26:33.859 --> 26:37.595
But that was nothing compared
to the punishment he feared

26:37.597 --> 26:39.863
if he told me
the truth.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.766
On his way to me for
questioning, he broke free,

26:42.768 --> 26:46.270
threw himself off the castle
walls, killing himself,

26:46.272 --> 26:49.173
because he knew that if he said
one word under torture,

26:49.175 --> 26:51.175
Catherine de Medici
would kill not only him

26:51.177 --> 26:53.210
but she would kill
his entire family.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.678
He knew it.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.380
And you know it, too.

26:56.382 --> 27:00.017
Lord Narcisse, you claim
that the way he died proves

27:00.019 --> 27:02.653
that Catherine had
a part in the crime.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.755
And somehow
I'm involved as well.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.691
Don't play coy with me,
Mary, I'm warning you.

27:07.693 --> 27:10.694
I can't help you because
I don't know where the gold is.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.930
I had no part
in stealing it.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.265
Now please leave my chambers.

27:15.267 --> 27:18.636
No, I think it will
be you who leaves.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.638
What?

27:20.640 --> 27:23.841
I don't trust you, Mary, Queen
of Scots, and I never will,

27:23.843 --> 27:27.378
and I will not have you lurking
around French court any longer.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.780
You are hereby banished
from this castle,

27:29.782 --> 27:31.048
to be gone by the
end of the week.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.149
No.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.317
My nation has
turned against me.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.318
I have
nowhere to go.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.653
You can't.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.054
Charles won't
allow it.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.689
Oh, once he hears the
case I have to make,

27:38.691 --> 27:40.758
I'm quite sure he will.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.361
¶ ¶

27:46.999 --> 27:49.733
(door opens and closes)

27:56.676 --> 27:58.676
We got word that Claude
ran away from Boinel.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.745
My men picked her up
on the road to Paris.

28:01.747 --> 28:04.114
You're not going to like
what you see, Charles.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.951
Our sister has not
been treated well.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.399
CHARLES:
Why didn't you come to me?

28:22.401 --> 28:23.467
Why did you run to Paris?

28:23.469 --> 28:25.302
I didn't know
what you would say.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.437
Because you couldn't
trust me to help?

28:26.439 --> 28:27.838
I'm so sorry,
Claude.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.239
This is all my fault.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.808
I blamed you
for forcing the marriage.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.478
This... you couldn't have known.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.413
It's Narcisse.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.382
This is all
Narcisse.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.953
Either he didn't know
who the duke really was,

28:42.955 --> 28:45.489
or he did
and lied.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.925
Mother warned me Narcisse
would put his own interests

28:47.927 --> 28:50.327
ahead of this family's.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.929
She was right.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.997
Please don't make me go
back to that man.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.432
Did you consummate
the marriage?

28:55.434 --> 28:58.168
Good God, no.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.871
I'll fix this.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.073
I promise.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.876
King Charles has annulled
his sister's marriage

29:05.878 --> 29:09.079
at the urging
of the queen mother.

29:09.081 --> 29:13.817
Catherine's act of defiance
cannot be tolerated.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.519
I'm told a council
meeting was called,

29:15.521 --> 29:18.522
but no one informed
or invited me. Why?

29:18.524 --> 29:21.125
It's a meeting to discuss
your family, Majesty.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.393
I felt it best that
we formulate recommendations

29:23.395 --> 29:25.062
before
involving you.
Good.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.864
I want to discuss
my family as well

29:26.866 --> 29:28.265
and what you have done to it.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.267
Majesty, with all due respect...

29:30.269 --> 29:32.286
Why don't you show
my son the respect

29:32.287 --> 29:34.304
of allowing him to finish
whatever it is he has to say?

29:35.541 --> 29:37.541
I may not be
old enough to rule,

29:37.543 --> 29:39.109
but I am old enough
to know who I can trust.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.545
Lord Narcisse put
my sister at risk,

29:41.547 --> 29:43.814
and I cannot forgive this.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.817
Majesty, please, you
can't judge Lord Narcisse

29:46.819 --> 29:48.051
on a single
failed union.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.219
Bad marriages happen every day.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.821
Not to my sister.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.456
Not while I'm king.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.091
I've known Narcisse long enough

29:54.093 --> 29:56.927
to see I can't trust him
to safeguard my family.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.462
That is why
I'm here today,

29:58.464 --> 29:59.997
to ask you
to put in his place

29:59.999 --> 30:02.800
a regent who will.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.235
Because she is part
of my family.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.172
My mother, Catherine de Medici.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.107
(chattering)

30:10.109 --> 30:14.945
But, Majesty, it's not your
place to decide who is regent.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.014
No, it's yours.

30:17.016 --> 30:20.584
Which is why I remind you that,
while you hold your power today,

30:20.586 --> 30:23.921
in a few short years, I will
have come into all my power.

30:23.923 --> 30:27.324
And I will remember
what happened today,

30:27.326 --> 30:30.994
who showed me their friendship,

30:30.996 --> 30:33.463
who didn't.

30:33.465 --> 30:37.201
My son has caught me
off guard with this, truly.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.504
And I can see that there is a
deep fondness for Lord Narcisse.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.372
Know that I
will honor this.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.608
I will allow him to stay
on the privy council.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.876
I still don't like it.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.845
It's a coup
by another name.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.946
Charles.

30:50.482 --> 30:54.351
A coup by the king,
do you mean?

30:57.323 --> 31:01.859
So shall we vote
or have more discussion?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.862
Personally,
I'm in the mood for a vote.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.297
GREER: No countries
have offered so far,

31:07.299 --> 31:10.000
but I've found various French
nobles who might take you in.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.636
They'll have to have
large enough courts

31:12.638 --> 31:15.072
that I can entertain
any potential suitors

31:15.074 --> 31:18.041
with appropriate ceremony.

31:18.043 --> 31:21.311
I have to make a powerful
marriage alliance.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.312
Mary!

31:22.314 --> 31:23.614
You won't believe it.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.315
Charles...
Oh.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.316
...he did it.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.351
I should leave
you alone.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.086
Uh, Catherine, what's going on?

31:29.088 --> 31:33.223
I am regent.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.258
How?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.159
(laughs) Charles,

31:36.161 --> 31:37.995
he was incensed
by what happened to Claude.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.563
He lost all faith in Narcisse.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.231
This was his decision.
I just...

31:41.233 --> 31:42.432
I stood there.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.967
(laughs)

31:43.969 --> 31:46.303
I let the crown settle
on my head.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.638
That's wonderful, Catherine.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.239
Oh, no,
it's much better than that.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.275
We're safe again, all of us.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.242
My children,

31:52.244 --> 31:53.911
my family's rule,

31:53.913 --> 31:56.313
and you, my dear friend.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.148
You have been there for me
time and again,

31:58.150 --> 31:59.650
and I will be there for you.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.285
It's a bit late
for that, I think.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.519
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.088
No, unpack these trunks.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.224
You think I'm gonna let
Narcisse banish you?

32:07.226 --> 32:09.626
Don't you have something
to drink in here?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.261
Where is it?

32:12.698 --> 32:14.965
We have to celebrate.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.036
Now that we're all safe,

32:19.038 --> 32:21.138
can you tell me what happened
to all that gold?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.941
(sighs)

32:23.943 --> 32:26.209
You know what, my dear,
you were right the first time.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.477
(sighs)

32:27.479 --> 32:29.346
It's better you don't know.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.081
ELIZABETH:
<i> I should start</i>

32:31.083 --> 32:33.283
by apologizing for my...

32:33.285 --> 32:36.186
abruptness the day we met.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.189
These are complicated times.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.125
But if this kind
of personal diplomacy

32:42.127 --> 32:44.361
can bring an understanding

32:44.363 --> 32:46.263
between our two countries,
is it not worth trying?

32:47.366 --> 32:49.199
I would like to see it succeed

32:49.201 --> 32:50.968
as much as you, Majesty.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.236
Possibly more so.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.038
Because of your captured family,
of course.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.308
Royals have such
a strange sense

32:58.310 --> 33:00.177
of family, don't you think?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.680
My father cut off
my mother's head.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.283
My sister jailed me

33:06.285 --> 33:07.651
as a threat to her rule.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.252
And you,

33:09.254 --> 33:11.254
you have a king's bastard
for a son.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.124
If you mean to impugn
my character,

33:14.126 --> 33:16.994
do not bring my son into it.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.062
He is the joy of my life.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.399
Even with all the upheaval
he brought?

33:24.269 --> 33:26.403
You never regretted
your pregnancy?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.206
Not from the moment he was born.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.273
(chuckles)

33:31.677 --> 33:33.176
(grunts)

33:33.178 --> 33:35.212
(panting)

33:35.214 --> 33:37.047
Are you all right?

33:38.317 --> 33:40.050
I-I could send for help.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.351
(sighs) No.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.686
I'm fine.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.421
(sighs)

33:53.665 --> 33:56.366
(night birds calling)

33:58.504 --> 33:59.703
(twig snaps)

33:59.705 --> 34:01.505
CATHERINE:
Wait.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.473
We're in the wrong place.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.708
A thousand apologies.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.476
No, you're in the right place.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.816
I know how you feel
about loose ends, Your Grace.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.418
Don't be absurd.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.318
I've come to pay you,
as promised.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.586
And why do you need

34:16.588 --> 34:18.488
all the archers
behind those trees?

34:21.794 --> 34:23.727
For my own security.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.829
A regent can face
many threats,

34:25.831 --> 34:29.232
from soldiers to assassins
as well as loose ends.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.502
You should advise them
not to loose.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.104
We don't want a bloodbath.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.214
All I want

34:44.216 --> 34:45.449
is my gold.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.650
Well, your gold, in truth.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.654
You did earn it.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.755
You played your part well.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.690
Though you might not

34:53.692 --> 34:55.358
have hit my daughter so hard.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.860
I've never struck
a woman before.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.462
But you said it needed
to be done

34:58.464 --> 35:01.164
to enrage your son and turn him
firmly against Narcisse.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.432
I suppose I don't need
to reproach you.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.668
Claude did that well enough
on her own.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.537
Oh, don't forget

35:07.539 --> 35:09.306
the rest of our deal.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.274
I want those vineyards

35:11.276 --> 35:12.409
as part of my duchy.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.777
You shall have them.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.279
Hear this, Catherine--
I swear on my life

35:16.281 --> 35:17.547
that I shall stay far away

35:17.549 --> 35:18.515
and stay silent.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.683
You'll have no reason

35:19.685 --> 35:21.618
to send your assassins.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.520
Very well.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.155
On your life.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.230
ELIZABETH:
What are you doing here?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.831
We can't be seen together.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.767
I had to come,

35:37.769 --> 35:40.337
as soon as I heard
you'd been poisoned.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.139
Are you all right?

35:42.141 --> 35:43.607
I don't know.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.810
It was awful.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.881
The pain.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.618
When I realized
I was having a miscarriage,

35:54.620 --> 35:57.454
I had to find someplace private
to let it come out.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.356
Where no one
would find me

35:59.358 --> 36:01.625
or see the blood.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.426
And then afterwards,
I had to clean it...

36:03.428 --> 36:04.494
(crying)

36:08.834 --> 36:10.667
I'm so sorry.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.738
Someone did this to me.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.641
Out of hate.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.644
Someone emboldened,

36:20.646 --> 36:22.612
knowing the entire country
felt the same way.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.815
But William tells me

36:25.817 --> 36:27.551
that the tribunal ended

36:27.553 --> 36:29.252
in a deadlock.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.454
And that you're free.

36:31.456 --> 36:32.522
(sighs)

36:33.492 --> 36:35.258
(sighs) There was enough doubt

36:35.260 --> 36:38.228
that they didn't put me
to trial.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.197
It's not quite the same
as being innocent.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.199
What kind of doubt?

36:42.201 --> 36:43.700
Doubt about Amy.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.403
Her odd behavior.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.470
Others saw it.

36:47.472 --> 36:48.605
There were no witnesses.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.575
Then you are free.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.476
But I'm not free to be with you.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.612
They still hate us,
Elizabeth.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.315
Not just the nobles,

36:58.317 --> 37:00.550
but the people, your people.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.987
They blame me for tarnishing
your reputation.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.656
Linking you to Amy's death.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.725
You have to move past this.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.495
You have to make them
forget it.

37:12.497 --> 37:15.365
And you can't do that with me
by your side.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.235
Amy is dead.

37:19.538 --> 37:20.604
Our baby is gone.

37:22.374 --> 37:23.773
And to what end?

37:23.775 --> 37:25.709
We are lost to each other.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.647
It is a fact I will grieve

37:30.649 --> 37:32.015
for the rest of my life.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.384
(sighs)

37:34.386 --> 37:36.386
As will I.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.658
I'll always love you,
Elizabeth.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.461
Always.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.431
Claude.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.833
My Lord,

37:49.835 --> 37:51.534
oh, you look awful.

37:51.536 --> 37:52.802
Where have you been?

37:52.804 --> 37:53.837
I'm sorry.
I-I should've been here sooner.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.672
I should've been there.

37:55.674 --> 37:56.706
I should've protected you.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.974
Leith, you idiot.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.576
You did protect me.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.844
You think I look awful,

38:00.846 --> 38:01.911
you should see Boinel.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.913
I gave as good as I got.

38:03.915 --> 38:04.914
Three quick jabs to the stomach,

38:04.916 --> 38:06.616
one to the throat.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.585
Just like you showed me.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.886
Did he drop?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.621
Like a drunk uncle.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.523
So...

38:13.525 --> 38:14.624
I'm free,

38:14.626 --> 38:15.592
unwed,

38:15.594 --> 38:16.960
and home again.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.296
Until when?

38:19.298 --> 38:20.764
Charles swore

38:20.766 --> 38:22.899
he would never force me
to marry after this.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.067
It can be like this

38:24.069 --> 38:25.468
for as long as we want.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.703
No.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.538
There's only one true way

38:28.540 --> 38:30.707
to protect you from having
to marry someone you don't want.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.677
Marry me.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.713
But, Leith, how?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.649
I will rise in station
until I am a candidate

38:39.651 --> 38:41.985
fit to marry a princess.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.854
I don't know how I'll do it,

38:44.856 --> 38:46.956
but I will.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.992
I believe you, my love.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.794
I believe you will.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.797
(gasps)

38:56.468 --> 38:57.667
(grunts)

38:57.669 --> 38:59.803
Is that all right?

38:59.805 --> 39:01.638
Yes.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.809
Yes, better still.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.781
(sighs)

39:11.783 --> 39:14.584
Your physician says
you can travel soon.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.953
You'll get the rest you need
at your country estate.

39:16.955 --> 39:20.623
I'll rest much easier when you
find out who tried to kill me.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.759
The investigation
is well under way.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.628
At the top of my list
is Mary and her lady Lola.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.097
Consider the timing.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.699
I have considered it.

39:29.701 --> 39:33.503
Why would Mary risk
her friend's life that way?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.038
Especially when our experiment

39:35.040 --> 39:36.873
with personal diplomacy
is just beginning.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.942
Mary needs peace
more than I do.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.979
Then who would you have me
focus on?

39:42.981 --> 39:45.482
The English did this to me.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.717
To punish me for daring

39:47.719 --> 39:49.719
to love who I want.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.823
Perhaps they were right.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.560
Perhaps I forgot what it means
to be a queen.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.797
But if I can't be with

40:00.799 --> 40:02.665
who I love,

40:02.667 --> 40:05.068
maybe I can give that gift
to someone else.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.839
(footsteps approaching)

40:09.841 --> 40:11.107
MARY:
Oh, I thought

40:11.109 --> 40:12.809
I might find you here.

40:12.811 --> 40:13.676
Thanking your lucky stars?

40:13.678 --> 40:14.677
Thanking them for what?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.079
You haven't heard?

40:16.081 --> 40:18.114
I got the news in a letter
from Lola today.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.116
Elizabeth is keeping her word.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.718
Your daughter is coming here.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.052
Agatha's coming to France.

40:23.822 --> 40:24.888
Oh.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.025
(gasps)

40:32.731 --> 40:33.630
(gasps)

40:33.632 --> 40:34.731
Gideon,

40:34.733 --> 40:36.533
no, we can't.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.634
I'm sorry. I just, um...

40:37.636 --> 40:38.768
We might be friends,

40:38.770 --> 40:39.803
but our countries
are still enemies.

40:39.805 --> 40:40.870
Mm-hmm.

40:40.872 --> 40:41.938
It's one thing to pretend,

40:41.940 --> 40:43.740
but to let this be real...

40:46.111 --> 40:47.444
Mary.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.517
No.
