THAT TAMED VORNICARN'S
SAVAGE SPIRIT.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.187
HIS NEED TO HUNT
A HELPLESS CREATURE--

21:12.270 --> 21:15.107
- COMBINED WITH NUTRITIONALLY
ENHANCED SUPER-CHOCOLATE.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.360
- OH, CHOCOLATE, IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN'T DO?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.028
I MEAN, OTHER THAN MATH.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.406
AND VORNICARN WILL STAY--
WHAT IS WORD?

21:22.489 --> 21:24.616
UM, HA'P'PY?

21:24.700 --> 21:25.909
[device whirs]

21:26.952 --> 21:28.912
- [excited grunt]

21:28.996 --> 21:30.998
[roars]

21:33.667 --> 21:35.127
[distant whirring]

21:35.210 --> 21:36.294
- NICE.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.879
- OH, AND LINK,
HERE'S YOUR DOLLY.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.048
- BUNBUN!

21:40.132 --> 21:41.717
HEY, HOW'D YOU GET THIS BACK?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.761
- LET'S JUST SAY...
IT ALL CAME OUT IN THE END.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.887
- TOO EASY.
