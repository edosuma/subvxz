and we're smack in the middle.

Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

52:03.518 --> 52:06.437

what I call half-breeds.

01:34:54.837 --> 01:34:58.840
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

01:34:59.008 --> 01:35:02.969
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

01:35:03.387 --> 01:35:07.057
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

01:35:07.767 --> 01:35:09.100
Help me here.

01:35:13.147 --> 01:35:17.442
You're handed this precious gift, right?

01:35:18.653 --> 01:35:22.697
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

01:35:23.699 --> 01:35:26.242
Murderers, rapists and molesters...

01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:28.745
all of you, you just have to repent...

01:35:28.913 --> 01:35:31.748
and God takes you into his bosom.

01:35:34.085 --> 01:35:36.336
In all the worlds in all the universe...

01:35:36.504 --> 01:35:39.422
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

01:35:41.884 --> 01:35:43.218
It's not fair.

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:51.351
If sweet, sweet God loves you so...

01:35:51.519 --> 01:35:54.521
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

01:35:56.190 --> 01:35:59.317
I've been watching you for a long time.

01:35:59.485 --> 01:36:04.155
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

01:36:04.323 --> 01:36:08.159
And you can be so noble.

01:36:10.871 --> 01:36:12.455
So...

01:36:13.124 --> 01:36:15.458
I'll bring you pain.

01:36:16.127 --> 01:36:18.503
I'll bring you horror.

01:36:20.214 --> 01:36:23.299
So that you may rise above it.

01:36:26.762 --> 01:36:30.682
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth...

01:36:30.850 --> 01:36:33.810
will be worthy of God's love.

01:36:33.978 --> 01:36:35.770
Gabriel...

01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:38.481
you're insane.

01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:43.611
The road to salvation begins tonight.

01:36:44.405 --> 01:36:46.114
Right now.

01:37:27.782 --> 01:37:30.784
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

01:37:32.328 --> 01:37:35.079
I'm not even welcome in your house.

01:37:36.665 --> 01:37:39.501
But I could use a little attention.

01:37:42.797 --> 01:37:44.506
Please.

01:38:30.886 --> 01:38:33.263
<i>GABRIEL:
Come forth.</i>

01:38:53.033 --> 01:38:54.909
Hurry.

01:39:12.136 --> 01:39:14.012
<i>GABRIEL:
Mammon...</i>

01:39:14.179 --> 01:39:16.639
son of Satan...

01:39:16.807 --> 01:39:21.269
I unleash you unto this world.

01:40:15.032 --> 01:40:16.366
Hello.

01:40:16.533 --> 01:40:18.618
What took you so long?

01:40:18.786 --> 01:40:21.079
<i>SATAN:
Hello, John.</i>

01:40:21.789 --> 01:40:25.124
John, hello.

01:40:29.964 --> 01:40:32.924
You're the one soul...

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:37.971
I would come up here
to collect myself. Mm-hm.

01:40:40.265 --> 01:40:42.642
So I've heard.

01:40:43.394 --> 01:40:44.727
You mind?

01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:48.147
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:50.566
Coffin nail.

01:40:51.068 --> 01:40:52.944
Very fitting, John.

01:40:55.823 --> 01:40:59.367
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

01:40:59.535 --> 01:41:02.328
finger movement goes
out the window.

01:41:02.496 --> 01:41:04.580
Let me help you.

01:41:15.968 --> 01:41:17.552
See?

01:41:19.388 --> 01:41:20.805
Sonny...

01:41:20.973 --> 01:41:26.102
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

01:41:26.854 --> 01:41:28.396
Well, aren't you a peach.

01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:34.027
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

01:41:38.866 --> 01:41:40.825
And you didn't...

01:41:41.577 --> 01:41:43.327
did you?

01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.246
So how's the family?

01:41:45.414 --> 01:41:51.377
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

01:41:51.712 --> 01:41:55.214
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

01:41:55.382 --> 01:41:58.426
Well, one does what one can.

01:41:58.594 --> 01:42:00.219
He's in the other room.

01:42:00.387 --> 01:42:03.181
Boys will be boys.

01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:05.725
With Gabriel.

01:42:08.562 --> 01:42:11.355
No accounting for taste, really.

01:42:11.732 --> 01:42:14.150
They have the Spear of Destiny.

01:42:16.904 --> 01:42:20.615
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

01:42:28.916 --> 01:42:32.126
Or is it another one of your cons?

01:42:34.213 --> 01:42:36.506
Go look for yourself.

01:42:39.551 --> 01:42:43.179
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

01:42:43.555 --> 01:42:46.599
what's another 20 seconds?

01:42:48.143 --> 01:42:50.103
(GROWLS)

01:43:51.331 --> 01:43:56.544
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

01:43:56.712 --> 01:43:59.297
You, best of all of us, Gabriel...

01:43:59.464 --> 01:44:04.677
should understand ambition.

01:44:04.845 --> 01:44:07.346
Son of perdition.

01:44:08.223 --> 01:44:09.557
Little horn.

01:44:11.685 --> 01:44:13.895
Most unclean.

01:44:14.062 --> 01:44:16.689
I do miss the old names.

01:44:17.566 --> 01:44:19.775
Time to go home, son.

01:44:19.943 --> 01:44:22.403
I will smite thee...

01:44:22.571 --> 01:44:25.489
in his honor.

01:44:30.621 --> 01:44:35.750
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

01:44:45.135 --> 01:44:47.178
(ROARING)

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.394
Father?

01:45:18.794 --> 01:45:20.211
So.

01:45:27.219 --> 01:45:28.552
So.

01:45:28.929 --> 01:45:32.682
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

01:45:37.437 --> 01:45:39.438
The sister...

01:45:40.357 --> 01:45:41.691
Isabel.

01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:45.528
What about her?

01:45:47.531 --> 01:45:49.949
Let her go home.

01:45:52.661 --> 01:45:57.248
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:10.094
Fine. It's done.

01:46:12.723 --> 01:46:16.183
Time to go, John.

01:46:16.518 --> 01:46:18.144
Yeah.

01:46:36.079 --> 01:46:38.414
(WHISTLING)

01:47:02.564 --> 01:47:04.231
(GRUNTS)

01:47:15.994 --> 01:47:17.995
The sacrifice.

01:47:29.591 --> 01:47:35.596
No. This one belongs to me.

01:47:45.565 --> 01:47:51.404
No. You will live, John Constantine.

01:47:54.491 --> 01:47:55.908
You will live.

01:47:58.495 --> 01:48:00.955
So you will have...

01:48:01.123 --> 01:48:02.498
(SCREAMS)

01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:05.292
the chance to prove...

01:48:07.921 --> 01:48:13.300
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

01:48:16.346 --> 01:48:19.432
Oh, you will live.

01:48:23.770 --> 01:48:27.565
You will live.

01:49:41.431 --> 01:49:43.432
Thank you.

01:49:45.852 --> 01:49:47.811
No problem.

01:49:54.569 --> 01:49:56.028
(GABRIEL COUGHING)

01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:05.621
<i>JOHN:
Human.</i>

01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:10.084
You don't deserve to be human.

01:50:11.586 --> 01:50:16.298
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.344
Do it.

01:50:21.638 --> 01:50:23.180
Do it.

01:50:24.724 --> 01:50:26.892
Seek revenge.

01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:29.353
End my life.

01:50:30.063 --> 01:50:31.605
Go on.

01:50:33.733 --> 01:50:35.234
Be the hand of God.

01:50:35.402 --> 01:50:37.778
It's your choice.

01:50:37.946 --> 01:50:40.197
It's always been your choice.

01:50:45.495 --> 01:50:46.912
Yeah.

01:50:52.586 --> 01:50:54.962
That's called pain.

01:50:55.130 --> 01:50:56.505
Get used to it.

01:51:02.929 --> 01:51:05.097
You could've shot me, John!

01:51:07.225 --> 01:51:10.102
You chose a higher path!

01:51:11.521 --> 01:51:14.315
Look how well you're doing!

01:51:39.841 --> 01:51:41.884

Nice spot.</i>

<i>JOHN:
I have something for you.</i>

01:51:50.685 --> 01:51:53.437
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

01:51:56.483 --> 01:51:59.026
Oh, how thoughtful.

01:52:04.324 --> 01:52:06.158
John...

01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:09.912
why are you giving me this?

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.538
Rules.

01:52:11.831 --> 01:52:13.332
Hide it.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.543
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

01:52:17.587 --> 01:52:19.254
Not even me.

01:52:19.422 --> 01:52:20.756
Ah.

01:52:23.426 --> 01:52:25.219
Always a catch.

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.263
Yeah.

01:52:41.361 --> 01:52:43.195
So.

01:52:44.823 --> 01:52:47.866
I've got some cleaning up to do.

01:52:51.705 --> 01:52:53.706
I'll...

see you around.

01:52:58.670 --> 01:53:00.587
I'd like that.
