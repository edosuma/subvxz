You, regrettably,

08:56.444 --> 08:57.761
have the floor.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.220
We need to stop teaching

08:59.222 --> 09:03.024
that my great-grandfather's
gazebo was a disaster.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.710
But it was,
and it was his fault.

09:05.937 --> 09:09.196
His dying words were, "My bad."

09:09.216 --> 09:10.957
So?
Why can't our kids learn

09:11.034 --> 09:13.034
about things that make
our town proud?

09:13.128 --> 09:15.111
Like, how if you want
to make a right on red,

09:15.130 --> 09:16.963
it's usually not a problem.

09:17.115 --> 09:19.874
Why do we have to focus
on the bad stuff?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.209
(indistinct chatter)

09:22.229 --> 09:24.954
We completely disagree.

09:25.123 --> 09:28.808
It's essential that all of
Springfield's darkest chapters

09:28.960 --> 09:30.902
be taught: the monorail,

09:31.129 --> 09:32.312
Lady Gaga's visit,

09:32.464 --> 09:34.406
and the gazebo collapse.

If our kids aren't made to feel
ashamed of the past,

09:37.393 --> 09:40.987
how will they learn
to be ashamed of the future?

09:41.139 --> 09:41.988
(indistinct chatter)

09:42.140 --> 09:43.397
Look at my son.

09:43.491 --> 09:45.900
You think he needs
to feel worse about himself

09:45.919 --> 09:48.828
than he already clearly does?
(grunts)

09:48.980 --> 09:51.648
You are doing this to him!

09:51.666 --> 09:53.650
(cheering)

09:53.743 --> 09:55.835
I agree with the bald lady.

09:55.912 --> 09:57.929
Why does history
have to be hurtful?

09:58.081 --> 09:59.598
Every book about World War II

09:59.825 --> 10:01.933
makes the Germans the bad guys.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.935
Stop teaching facts!

Historical guilt is everything.

Those who cannot
remember the past

10:11.761 --> 10:13.519

10:13.614 --> 10:16.615
On the other hand, those
who cannot remember the past

10:16.766 --> 10:18.933
are condemned to repeat it.

10:19.027 --> 10:21.435
People, people, people!
People.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.030
We are not
going to settle this tonight.

10:24.182 --> 10:25.957
I move that we end this meeting

10:26.109 --> 10:28.109
with everyone
angry and dissatisfied.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.461
All in favor?

10:29.612 --> 10:30.962
ALL:
Boo!

10:31.189 --> 10:33.131
Wonderful.
It's unanimous.

10:33.324 --> 10:33.965
Mm.

10:34.192 --> 10:36.042
Dad, I know this
is a weird thing

10:36.194 --> 10:38.136
for a son to say to his father,

10:38.363 --> 10:40.121
but I'm proud of you.

10:40.215 --> 10:42.715
You actually convinced people.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.033
I did?

10:44.202 --> 10:45.885
You the man, Kirk.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.038
-I am?
-No, you the my man.

10:49.132 --> 10:50.540
This marriage may have

10:50.558 --> 10:53.068
just got un-sexless.

10:54.303 --> 10:56.655
It's so sad when people
can't get along.

10:56.806 --> 10:58.973
It causes upsetment.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.142
Marge, people need to disagree

11:01.161 --> 11:02.810
and have their voice
shouted over.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.997
That's what democracy was.
Remember that?

11:06.107 --> 11:09.225
But everyone in this country
is so divided.

11:09.244 --> 11:12.420
Where will all
this hostility lead?

11:13.565 --> 11:15.156
I'll tell you
where it leads, Homer.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.093
Straight to the bank--
the money bank.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.403
-(backboard clanks)
-This is the idea

11:20.422 --> 11:22.663
-you've been looking for.
-It is?

11:22.683 --> 11:25.408
What's the one thing
every American has in common?

11:25.427 --> 11:28.019
(gasps)
They're furious all the time

11:28.171 --> 11:29.746
about everything.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.172
Ex-Shaq-ly.

11:31.266 --> 11:34.025
Now, think-- how can you
make money from that?

11:34.177 --> 11:38.029
I know just what to do.

<i> Oh, hi there.</i>

12:31.067 --> 12:32.809

<i> and "Who farted? All the cows</i>
<i> raised by the beef industry!"</i>

12:40.576 --> 12:41.742
That's despicable.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.836

makes a good point.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.598
