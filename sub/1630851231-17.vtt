00:02.741 --> 00:03.655
- You're going
to be fine, sweetie.

00:03.742 --> 00:05.396
Just take a few deep breaths.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.442
It's probably a stomachache
or a food poisoning.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.794
I think I'm gonna be sick.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.712
John, I really need
to go to the hospital.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.497
- That's not a good idea, babe.
I'll get you some water.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.933
Maybe you're just
really dehydrated.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.544
- No, I need to go
to the hospital right now.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.546
I'm dying.

00:33.816 --> 00:34.860
- She's sick, man.

00:34.947 --> 00:35.600
We need to get her
to the hospital.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.256
- No!

00:46.307 --> 00:47.612
Help!

01:01.409 --> 01:03.063
- She's funny too,
like, for real.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.847
I know. It's ridiculous.

01:04.934 --> 01:05.978
- If you screw this up...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.545
- No, I'm trying.
Trust me, okay?

01:07.632 --> 01:09.199
Been sharing my feelings.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.679
- Wow, a complete rebrand.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.159
- I sent her a text last night.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.769
Just told her
what a great time I had,

01:13.856 --> 01:15.423
that I can't wait
to see her again.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.989
- I literally
don't believe you.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.470
- I'm telling you, Tiff.
I'm a new man.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.430
- So was she overwhelmed by
your honesty and vulnerability?

01:22.517 --> 01:25.520
- Well, I don't know.
She didn't text me back yet.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.915
- That'll teach you.
- Right.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.700
Oh.

01:31.787 --> 01:32.962
Two bodies just found

01:33.049 --> 01:34.659
at General Grant's
National Memorial.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.578
- Dog walker found the bodies
around15 a.m.

01:40.665 --> 01:44.365
Two victims, one male,
one female, both white.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.845
Male has been identified
as John Kraus,

01:46.932 --> 01:49.283
25, took one in the forehead.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.636
Female victim,
Julia Miller, 22,

01:54.723 --> 01:55.985
wasn't so lucky.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.425
- Poor kid.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.035
- Oh, my God.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.692
- Gutted like a fish.

02:07.779 --> 02:12.175
- Damn, that's some satanic,
devil-worshiping thing.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.875
- Robbery?
- Don't think so.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.703
We found cash and credit cards
in their wallets

02:18.790 --> 02:19.878
but no phones.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.010
- Witnesses?

02:22.446 --> 02:23.839
Cameras?

02:23.926 --> 02:25.623
- There are a few
over near the monument

02:25.710 --> 02:27.669
but nothing back here.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.714
If I hear anything else,
I'll be in touch.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.113
- All right, folks,
so two people are dead.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.201
Let's talk about 'em.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.855
- According to DHS records,

02:39.942 --> 02:41.944
they returned from Cancun
just hours before their attack.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.685
- Okay,
a trip to Mexico's helpful.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.816
We scrubbin'
airport terminal footage?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.253
- Yeah, I'm already on it.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.471
- All right, talk to me
about these victims.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.343
- Julia Miller, 22.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.693
Student at NYU.
Born and raised in New York.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.869
Father deceased.
Mother lives in Riverdale.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.000
- Did she file
any recent complaints?

02:55.087 --> 02:56.524
Any prior arrests?

02:56.611 --> 02:58.047
Anything that might point
to these horrific murders?

02:58.134 --> 03:01.268
- No, nothing obvious,
but I'll keep digging.

03:01.355 --> 03:05.315
- What about the male?
- Name is John Kraus, 25.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.710
Graphic designer.
Graduated from NYU last year.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.668
Parents live
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.453
- Social media?
Wait, were they a couple?

03:12.540 --> 03:14.324
- Looks like it.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.413
Most of their posts
are standard stuff.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.111
Food photos, ski vacations,
beach selfies.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.418
- So they just got back
from vacation, right?

03:21.505 --> 03:22.724
What did they post
about the Mexico trip?

03:24.987 --> 03:27.076
- Nothing.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.165
- Really? That's odd.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.515
So maybe this Cancun trip
wasn't a vacation.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.690
Where are we
on that airport video?

03:32.777 --> 03:34.170
Who picked them up?

03:34.257 --> 03:35.302
- Don't know who,
but I have a visual on the car.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.346
- Good.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.478
- Gray Ford picks them up

03:37.565 --> 03:39.001
outside the Delta terminal
at04.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.003
- Who is this?
Livery, Uber, friend?

03:41.090 --> 03:42.526
- Not sure, I can't see
the driver

03:42.613 --> 03:43.788
or the license plate.
- Yeah, all right.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.963
We need another shot
of that car.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.357
- Gotcha.
- What about their phones?

03:47.444 --> 03:48.576
- Still can't track them down.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.838
There's nothing registered

03:49.925 --> 03:51.535
to either Julia Miller
or John Kraus.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.972
- No phones?
How is that even possible?

03:54.059 --> 03:55.844
All right, there are
some holes to this story.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.237
Let's start filling 'em.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.455
You said her mom lives
in Riverdale, yeah?

03:58.542 --> 03:59.761
- Yeah.
- Let's track her down.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.328
Have Maggie and OA talk to her.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.464
- She was a good kid,
a good student.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.684
She wanted to be a journalist.

04:09.771 --> 04:13.035
- I can only imagine what
you're going through right now.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.863
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

04:16.865 --> 04:19.563
- Julia attended NYU, correct?
- Yes.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.783
She had one more semester.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.176
- And her boyfriend, John?

04:24.264 --> 04:27.310
- He was--
he graduated last year.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.833
He was a graphic designer.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.272
- Okay.
Was anything unusual going on?

04:32.359 --> 04:34.491
Gambling, stalking, drugs,
something like that?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.101
- Oh, no,
not that I was aware of.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.060
- What about money issues?

04:38.147 --> 04:40.149
- Of course,
they were young and broke

04:40.236 --> 04:43.195
like all kids
in their early twenties.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.762
- So the trip
they just took to Mexico.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.677
You paid for that?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.810
- What trip?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.333
- They were in Mexico
for the last three days.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.726
They got back last night.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.251
- That's news to me.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.082
I'm not sure
how they paid for it either.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.614
- Cause of death
for both victims

05:10.701 --> 05:12.094
is pretty straightforward,

05:12.181 --> 05:13.965
but I did find
something interesting

05:14.052 --> 05:16.751
in the female DOA's
small intestine.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.188
Tiny rubber particles.
- That's odd.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.842
- Not if you're
smuggling cocaine.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.234
Tox report just came back.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.759
She had lethal amounts
of cocaine in her blood.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.196
If the knife didn't kill her,
the coke would have.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.589
- She's a drug mule.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.852
- Swallows a few balloons,
hops on a plane,

05:30.939 --> 05:32.723
one of the packages
starts leaking.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.682
- Dealer freaks out,
thinks she's gonna die,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.161
so he cuts her open
to retrieve the dope.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.295
- Anything else, Doctor?

05:39.382 --> 05:41.123
Any physical evidence
on the body?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.778
- Yeah, I found DNA
in the female's fingernails.

05:43.865 --> 05:47.129
Ran it through database,
but came up empty.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.001
- Thanks, Neil.
At least we have a motive.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.439
- Pretty nasty one too,
but it's a lot better

05:52.526 --> 05:54.005
than all that
devil voodoo stuff.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.139
- All right, so the story's
coming into focus.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.227
A couple of kids
trying to make some money

05:58.314 --> 05:59.489
the wrong way.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.882
We making any headway in here?

06:00.969 --> 06:02.449
- Yeah,
pulled some traffic cam video

06:02.536 --> 06:04.189
of the same make and model car
exiting the airport

06:04.276 --> 06:06.278
at09, 3 people visible.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.063
- Okay,
so we get a license plate?

06:08.150 --> 06:12.023
- Yeah, it comes back
to a Benny Gomez, 30,

06:12.110 --> 06:13.547
two misdemeanor drug arrests

06:13.634 --> 06:14.983
and a felony
battery conviction.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.637
- Okay, looks like
we have a suspect.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.726
Get the LK over
to Scola and Tiffany.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.732
- FBI.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.909
Benny Gomez, we need to talk.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.654
Hey, there he--Benny.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.525
Hey, wait!

06:37.527 --> 06:39.442
- What are you doing?

06:39.529 --> 06:41.792
- Suspect is fleeing east on
Florence Avenue in Greenpoint.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.117
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!

07:18.525 --> 07:20.875
- We lost eyes on our suspect
headed south on 25th Avenue.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.180
Name is Benny Gomez.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.095
5'10 Hispanic male,
medium build.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.883
- Talk to me.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.362
- We were able to track Gomez
on security cams

07:30.450 --> 07:31.799
for ten blocks,
but then he disappeared.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.365
- Okay, so he either
has a hiding spot

07:33.453 --> 07:34.715
near where he disappeared

07:34.802 --> 07:36.543
or what,
he hopped on the subway?

07:36.630 --> 07:38.370
- It doesn't appear he has
any family in that area.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.546
- And we were able
to check video

07:39.633 --> 07:41.069
at the three nearest
subway stations.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.679
- All right, so maybe he
took off in a cab or a car.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.376
- Or he stole one?
- Yeah, even better.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.726
Maya?
- Yeah.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.728
Only one car
reported stolen in the area

07:47.815 --> 07:50.426
in the last 15 minutes,
a late model Toyota Camry.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.516
License plate OAB-4345.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.213
- I'll try to access
the GPS system.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.052
- It's empty.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.595
Tiff, I got him.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.991
Is that him out on the roof
talking to another person?

08:34.078 --> 08:36.820
- Yeah, that's him,
but who's that woman?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.953
- I have no clue.
I can't see her face.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.960
- FBI, don't move!
- Put your hands up!

08:48.702 --> 08:50.181
- Face away from me.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.408
- All right, Gomez.

08:59.495 --> 09:00.452
- You're coming with us.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.287
- You're also under arrest.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.420
- What the hell
are you doing, Scola?

09:22.997 --> 09:25.652
- What is going on here, Nina?
- He's my informant, okay?

09:25.739 --> 09:27.001
I've been working
with him for months

09:27.088 --> 09:28.524
trying to take down
the Mexican Regents.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.178
- The Regents?
- Yes, and we're close.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.701
He was about to introduce me
to his boss,

09:31.788 --> 09:33.529
a guy named Octavio Lopez.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.400
- Okay, well, obviously,
we had no idea.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.664
Okay, we tried to talk to Gomez
earlier this morning,

09:37.751 --> 09:38.839
and he took off running.

09:38.926 --> 09:39.970
A few hours later,
we got a lead,

09:40.057 --> 09:41.102
so we moved on him.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.669
- Why do you need
to talk to him?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.845
- He's a person of interest
in a double homicide.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.673
- Gomez?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.197
Come on, he's a runner,
a glorified limo driver.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.025
- Well, the facts
say something different,

09:51.112 --> 09:53.810
so we need to bring him down
to 26 Fed for questioning.

09:53.897 --> 09:57.074
- I'm telling you
he didn't kill anyone.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.554
- I still gotta talk to him.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.731
- I wanna sit in then.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.473
I've been working this case
for seven months, all right?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.518
I need to be in the loop.
Simple as that.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.130
- I'll see what I can do.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.087
- Excuse me.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.178
You wanna unhook me?

10:14.265 --> 10:17.138
- Sorry about that, yeah.
Gotcha.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.749
Hey, and for the record,

10:19.836 --> 10:22.752
sorry about
what happened last year too.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.580
- Oh, that?
Yeah, it's all good, bro.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.190
Not a big deal.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.850
- Gomez is her informant.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.243
She trusts him,
thinks he's innocent,

10:35.330 --> 10:36.766
but she wants to know
what's going on.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.115
Thinks there could be
implications

10:38.202 --> 10:39.682
for her undercover case.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.206
- Fine, but don't let it
influence your interrogations.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.643
If Gomez is involved
in these murders,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.035
we are going to arrest him,

10:45.122 --> 10:46.950
and we're not cutting him
any breaks either.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.215
Yes.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
- It's the director.
Said it's important.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.784
- Okay, put him through.

11:05.055 --> 11:08.058
- I keep telling you, man,
I'm just a runner.

11:08.145 --> 11:10.539
I work for Octavio Lopez.
I pick up cash.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.583
I take it from one place
to another.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.368
That's it.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.891
- Come on, Benny.
I'm trying to help here.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.024
All right?
So stop lying to me.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.460
- The director
would appreciate it

11:18.547 --> 11:20.941
if we had someone in custody
by the end of the day.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.465
Apparently, a young woman
gutted and dead on federal land

11:23.552 --> 11:24.901
is a bad look for us.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.076
- It's a bad look
for everyone, isn't it?

11:28.165 --> 11:32.474
- This is you in your car
at the airport, okay?

11:32.561 --> 11:34.606
And these are the two kids
getting into your car

11:34.694 --> 11:36.957
two hours before
they both wound up dead.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.309
- Benny, they know
you're no choir boy, okay?

11:41.396 --> 11:43.050
So as long as you weren't
involved in the murders,

11:43.137 --> 11:45.313
just tell him what you know.

11:46.836 --> 11:47.794
- What are you saying,
I can trust him?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.886
- Look, I'm guessing you
didn't kill those kids, okay?

11:52.973 --> 11:55.366
So the sooner
you make that clear,

11:55.453 --> 11:56.672
the sooner we're outta here.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.286
- Okay.

12:02.373 --> 12:05.420
Octavio's driver got sick,
so he called me.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.465
Told me to go to the airport
and pick up the two kids.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.641
- Where'd you take them?
- To the park.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.948
I was supposed to take them
to Octavio's house,

12:12.035 --> 12:13.471
but the girl said
she wasn't feeling good.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.777
She said
she was gonna throw up.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.039
So I pulled him to the park.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.258
I told her and her boyfriend

12:17.345 --> 12:19.129
to get out,
you know, go outside,

12:19.216 --> 12:20.827
go for a walk,
get some fresh air.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.872
- And what did you do while
they were getting fresh air?

12:22.959 --> 12:24.700
- I called Octavio.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.529
I told him what was going on.
He told me to take off.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.227
Said he would handle the rest.
That's all I know.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.752
- So if you took off
and that's all you know,

12:32.839 --> 12:35.102
why'd you run when we showed up
at your apartment?

12:35.189 --> 12:37.104
- Oh, because I saw the news.
I knew what happened.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.150
I got nervous, so I ran.
Wouldn't you?

12:46.374 --> 12:47.854
- So it looks like Gomez
is telling the truth.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.725
We found video of him
driving away

12:49.812 --> 12:51.509
as John and Julie
were walking into the park.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.381
We also have video of him

12:53.468 --> 12:56.471
going into his apartment
20 minutes later alone.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.733
- And me and Maggie
searched that apartment.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.387
No evidence, no blood.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.432
- What about the DNA
under Julie's nails?

13:01.519 --> 13:05.436
- Doesn't match.
- Thanks.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.221
Hey, so looks like
your informant

13:07.308 --> 13:10.224
was telling the truth.
- Huh, told you he was solid.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.878
- Well, let's
take advantage of it.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.314
Let's wire him up, get him
in the same room as Octavio,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.707
have him ask
a few innocent questions

13:15.795 --> 13:17.709
about the victims' murders.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.756
- No, I've been working
this case for months,

13:20.843 --> 13:22.627
and I'm too close
to wrapping it up.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.934
I mean, I'm two steps away
from a sit-down with his boss,

13:25.021 --> 13:27.502
Hector Garcia,
street name El Perro.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.809
Look, if you bring in Octavio
for questioning,

13:29.896 --> 13:32.420
El Perro will
take off to Mexico guaranteed.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.117
- I can appreciate
your concern.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.989
- I mean, do you guys
have any proof

13:36.076 --> 13:37.904
that Octavio actually
committed these murders,

13:37.991 --> 13:40.123
or is this just
a fishing expedition?

13:44.127 --> 13:47.043
- What we know
is what Gomez told us,

13:47.130 --> 13:49.045
but it sure as hell
sounds like Octavio

13:49.132 --> 13:50.612
was involved,
his drugs, his mules.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.483
He knew the victims
were in the park,

13:52.570 --> 13:54.050
and he knew
that Julia wasn't feeling well.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.666
- What if we use Gomez
but agree not to arrest Octavio

14:01.753 --> 14:03.233
if he says
something incriminating?

14:03.320 --> 14:05.975
We hold on to the information,
keep Octavio in play

14:06.062 --> 14:08.891
until you get your introduction
to El Perro?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.376
- Yeah, I'm okay with that.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.904
- Yeah, okay.

14:21.991 --> 14:25.342
- Good.
- Great.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.477
- I want you to just
get Octavio talking

14:29.564 --> 14:31.131
about the kids in the park.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.610
Pretend you don't know
they're dead, okay?

14:32.697 --> 14:35.396
You know,
you're just making small talk.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.398
- I gotta take it
real slow man.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.488
Octavio's real suspicious
of everyone.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.794
That dude doesn't trust
his own mother.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.101
I heard him ask her one time if
she was working for the police.

14:45.188 --> 14:48.626
- Hey, just dance
around it, okay?

14:48.713 --> 14:51.499
- Or just ask him
about the college girl, okay?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.370
She got really sick.
Something like that?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.417
- Hey, we got this, okay?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.551
Look, if you don't get
any traction on the victims,

15:00.638 --> 15:02.205
I want you to look around
his house for something

15:02.292 --> 15:03.815
with DNA on it, okay?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.079
A towel, a beer bottle,
a toothbrush, or something.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.863
- Yeah, I can do that.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.171
- Okay, let's do this.

15:15.218 --> 15:19.266
- Oh, Nina don't play, huh?
- Nope, not even been a little.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.834
- Just so we're clear,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.576
no matter what Octavio says,
no matter what we get

15:25.663 --> 15:28.971
on wire or on video,
we're gonna let him walk.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.190
- We just talked about this.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.626
I was the one
who suggested that.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.541
- I just wanted to clarify.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.327
- Benny's pulling up.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.617
- Hey, what's up man?

16:11.709 --> 16:12.623
- You want
something to drink?

16:12.710 --> 16:14.103
A beer? Anything?

16:14.190 --> 16:18.368
- Uh, no, I'm good, but thanks.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.718
- Qué tal, Gomez?
What's so important?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.373
- I just wanted to make sure

16:23.460 --> 16:25.201
everything worked out
the other night.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.901
- What are you talking about?
- The other night?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.948
The kids, the boy and the girl
I picked up at the airport.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.299
- I don't know anything
about none of that.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.434
- Hey, Benny.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.740
Back off a little.
Chill out for now.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.394
- Chill out?
He barely even started.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.962
- Give him some time.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.485
- All right, cool.
If you cool, I'm cool.

16:49.747 --> 16:50.879
- Good.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.795
You got anything else
to talk about?

16:53.882 --> 16:56.145
I gotta pick up my daughter
from school soon.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.278
- No, I just wanted to
touch base about last night,

16:58.365 --> 17:00.628
but I guess we're all good
on that, so.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.152
Oh, there's one other thing.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.545
I met up with my girl Nina
this morning,

17:04.632 --> 17:06.460
the one from Canada.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.070
- Right,
the one with all the money.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.811
- That's her.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.814
She's got lots
of cash behind her.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.990
She was hoping to meet you.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.470
She's just looking
for a new supply, that's all.

17:16.557 --> 17:17.862
- Is she legit?
You checked her out?

17:17.949 --> 17:19.168
- Yeah, yeah, man.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.604
She knows the business
inside and out.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.390
- You remind him about the DNA?
- He knows.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.870
- I don't know. Maybe.
I'll think about it.

17:29.744 --> 17:30.875
- What the hell is he doing?

17:30.962 --> 17:32.268
- Getting the hell
out of there?

17:32.355 --> 17:33.313
- He didn't even attempt
to look for anything.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.618
- You don't know that.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.229
- Nina, two people
were just killed.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.708
A college kid was cut open.
- Don't put that on me.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.058
That is your case
and your problem,

17:39.145 --> 17:40.711
not mine
and not my informant's.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.845
- Look, I know this is
a delicate situation,

17:43.932 --> 17:46.848
that this case
is really important to you,

17:46.935 --> 17:48.763
but we're not here
trying to blow you up.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.156
We just looking for evidence.
That's it.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.252
- You want evidence?
You want DNA?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.515
Okay.

18:08.391 --> 18:11.002
- I need to know what the hell
is going on, like, now.

18:11.090 --> 18:15.529
- Okay, we kind of dated
a year ago.

18:15.616 --> 18:16.878
- Kind of dated?

18:18.749 --> 18:21.012
- All right, look,
we hooked up one night,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.580
and I never followed up.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.041
She's a good agent.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.522
- So she's really smart,
really pretty,

18:52.609 --> 18:54.045
and a really good agent.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.047
Damn, Scola.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.398
You are more screwed up
than I thought.

18:58.485 --> 19:02.010
- Was.
I mean, I've changed, right?

19:02.097 --> 19:03.359
- Yeah.

19:09.887 --> 19:13.413
- There's your DNA. Happy?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.562
- Hey,
preliminary results are in.

19:32.649 --> 19:36.305
The DNA does not match
from the cigarette butts.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.698
- So Octavio isn't our killer.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.613
- Yeah,
it doesn't appear that way.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.005
- I've already talked
to Nina's supervisor,

19:41.092 --> 19:42.659
and we both feel,
at the end of the day,

19:42.746 --> 19:44.183
folding her investigation
into ours

19:44.270 --> 19:46.185
will produce the best results.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.797
- So we're taking over
her case?

19:49.884 --> 19:52.060
- Helping her make an arrest
will allow us

19:52.147 --> 19:54.758
to leverage Octavio
and the rest for answers.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.196
- I get that,
but after what just happened,

19:57.283 --> 19:59.285
I'm a little surprised
Nina's willing to collaborate.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.461
- It's not her decision.
It's mine.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.770
- She doesn't know yet?
- No.

20:16.911 --> 20:20.131
- So the DNA isn't a match,
which means--

20:20.219 --> 20:21.437
- I know what it means.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.134
I already got a call
from my SAC.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.745
- Okay, it is isn't personal.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.138
We're just trying
to make our case.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.358
- Yeah, by blowing up mine?

20:29.445 --> 20:31.186
- And that's not
how it'll go down.

20:31.273 --> 20:34.015
We'll be working the case
with you hand in glove.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.843
- Yeah, no offense,
I don't really want your hand

20:35.930 --> 20:37.932
anywhere near my glove
or my case,

20:38.019 --> 20:39.325
but it is what it is.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.718
- Listen, I want to
clear the air about--

20:41.805 --> 20:43.154
- Look, the meeting
with Octavio

20:43.242 --> 20:44.721
is set up for later today.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.549
The goal is
to make him comfortable

20:46.636 --> 20:49.291
and to sell my cover story,
so you guys need to stay wide.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.511
- Okay. Then what?

20:51.598 --> 20:53.556
- Well,
Octavio is gonna get me

20:53.643 --> 20:55.950
a sit-down face-to-face
with El Perro.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.387
We'll set up the buy,
and we'll do the deal tomorrow.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.347
- Sounds like a plan.
- It is.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.522
Don't screw it up.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.833
- Hey, bro. Good, have fun.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.009
- Octavio and some guy
just walked in.

21:12.096 --> 21:15.926
- Copy that.
- All right, here we go.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.364
He's punctual.
Most drug dealers aren't.

21:24.892 --> 21:28.896
Okay, sending the director
of the FBI to voicemail.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.638
That's bold.
- Well, I don't have a choice.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.901
He wants answers,
and I don't have them.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.169
- Let's be careful, guys.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.562
We don't know how many eyes
he already has in this place.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.959
- Nina, headed towards
your table right now.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.539
- What up, homey?
- What's up, man?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.326
All right,
straight to business then.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.111
- Don't get it twisted.
We ain't doing business.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.286
We're just talking.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.290
This guy says you're cool,
but how do I know that?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.858
- You don't.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.426
- Then why the hell
should I mess with you?

22:20.513 --> 22:22.689
- Because you're
greedy like me.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.212
The people I represent
in Toronto

22:24.299 --> 22:26.867
are looking for a friend
this side of the border,

22:26.954 --> 22:29.391
one that's capable
of delivering a lot of weight.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.827
- How much weight?

22:30.914 --> 22:33.003
- Twenty bricks
every two weeks.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.527
We'll keep buying as long
as the purity is high

22:34.614 --> 22:36.093
and the price is low.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.052
- You don't gotta worry
about the quality.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
Our stuff
is as good as it gets.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.491
- He's right,
but bricks don't come cheap.

22:42.578 --> 22:45.059
You're looking at 40 a pop.

22:45.146 --> 22:46.756
- Forty apiece?

22:46.843 --> 22:49.803
- You heard the man.
That's the number.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.937
You think I'm a cop
or something?

22:54.024 --> 22:56.200
You think I'm gonna jump
at a stupid price like that?

22:56.287 --> 22:58.464
- I don't know
who or what you are.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.639
That's the problem.

23:02.119 --> 23:02.816
- Let's go.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.515
- Hold up.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.781
- What's the real price?

23:11.868 --> 23:14.915
- 25.
Purity guaranteed above 70%.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.657
But my boss wants half
the money prior to delivery.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.357
- I gotta make a call,

23:22.444 --> 23:24.403
see how my partners back home
feel about this.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.449
- Okay. Make it fast.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.672
- You're right.
She's really good.

23:32.759 --> 23:35.544
- Nah, homey, you stay with us.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.026
- Yeah, it's all good.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.382
- Hey, you sure she's legit?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.471
I did a few things with her
and her people.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.647
- What kind of things?

23:51.734 --> 23:53.475
- Crossing the border
with a load.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.566
On my life, O, she's legit.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.047
- Better be.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.355
- Hey, Nina, you might wanna
wrap up that call.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.748
Octavio is looking nervous.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.141
- Okay, it's not my first deal,

24:07.228 --> 24:09.012
but make sure
you have my back, okay?

24:09.099 --> 24:10.579
- We got it.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.194
- Put that crap out.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.631
I hate when you light
those damn things around me.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.551
- Did you hear that?
- Octavio doesn't smoke.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.683
- Meaning the DNA we tested
from the cigarette butts

24:27.770 --> 24:29.555
wasn't Octavio's.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.648
- What's it gonna be, chica?
You in or out?

24:38.781 --> 24:42.002
- We'll front 20%
as a gesture of goodwill.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.569
That's as far
as we're willing to go,

24:45.484 --> 24:46.920
- Shouldn't be a problem.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.707
We'll be in touch.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.406
Oh, you got this, right?

25:04.981 --> 25:06.505
- All right, it looks
like they're heading out.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.418
You guys ready to follow off?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.508
- We're on it.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.426
- We'll stay on Nina and Gomez
until you guys tell us

25:15.514 --> 25:16.950
that Octavio has pulled away.

25:20.475 --> 25:23.434
Might still be good
for these murders.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.653
I saw him take a drink.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.270
- Yes, sir, I understand.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.231
You will be the first to know,
I promise.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.020
- Let me guess,
the director again?

25:44.107 --> 25:45.500
- Yeah.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.677
- Nina's informant
just got the call.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.026
The meeting with El Perro
is a go.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.332
Set to happen at a park
over in Queens.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.639
- Get that buy money ready.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.163
Listen, I need this deal
to go as smoothly as possible,

25:56.250 --> 25:57.947
so you get down there,
get to work,

25:58.034 --> 25:59.383
and arrest those bastards.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.305
- Hey.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.090
- All right.

26:10.177 --> 26:14.007
12 stacks of 10K each
for a total of 120,000.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.096
- I heard there's
another DNA sample out there.

26:16.183 --> 26:20.013
- Yeah, Octavio's saliva,
so we'll see.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.406
- Yeah, but our deal
still remains the same, right?

26:22.493 --> 26:25.322
You wait until I make my case.
- Correct.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.368
- Look, El Perro
is a major player--

26:27.455 --> 26:28.543
- I know.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.632
He's responsible for what,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.112
a quarter of all the cocaine
in the Northeast?

26:32.199 --> 26:33.722
- More than that.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.768
Not to mention all of
the violence and murders.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.334
- Nina, I get it.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.468
I got your back on this.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.646
I promise.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.997
- Okay.

26:58.529 --> 26:59.922
- It may not look like it,

27:00.009 --> 27:02.664
but the resolution
on this necklace cam is 4k.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.535
- All right.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.636
- May I?

27:19.115 --> 27:20.639
- Yeah.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.824
You okay?
- Yeah, sorry, I just--

27:35.479 --> 27:39.701
- Yeah, let's go.
I have things to do.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.834
- Okay, and there you go.
- Thanks.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.494
- Hey.
- Yeah.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.844
- Gomez is, like,
15 minutes late.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.280
Is there any reason
to be concerned?

27:53.367 --> 27:54.585
- No, he's solid.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.586
He's probably
just running late.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.153
- Just a heads up.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.025
There's no movement
at Octavio's house,

27:59.112 --> 28:00.591
and the meeting
is in 12 minutes.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.897
- Maybe they're
having second thoughts?

28:05.858 --> 28:07.381
- We got a car pulling up.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.821
The driver is
getting out of the car.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.956
- Is that El Perro?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.264
- No, that's Gomez.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.831
- That wasn't part of the plan.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.833
- Scola,
we might have a problem.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.359
- Gomez say anything
about paying Octavio a visit?

28:29.446 --> 28:32.754
- No.
- Then why did he?

28:32.841 --> 28:34.669
- I don't know, probably just
to calm his nerves.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.844
- Yeah, or warning him.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.280
You could be
walking into a trap.

28:37.367 --> 28:38.891
- All right, relax, okay?
Gomez and I are tight.

28:38.978 --> 28:39.892
We've been working together
for three years.

28:39.979 --> 28:40.936
I trust him.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.521
- Gomez has left
Octavio's house.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.044
- Copy that.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.439
- Hey, what if you're wrong?

29:05.526 --> 29:06.745
- I'm good at reading people,

29:06.832 --> 29:08.007
knowing whether
they're trustworthy.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.182
Now let's do this.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.802
- You're late.
- Sorry.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.978
Had to swing by
and calm down Octavio.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.023
He's getting cold feet.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.635
- Yeah, but we're good, right?

29:27.722 --> 29:30.420
- Yeah, but El Perro
won't be at the meeting.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.422
- What do you mean?

29:32.509 --> 29:34.947
- El Perro said he wants
Octavio to see the money

29:35.034 --> 29:36.687
before he decides
to meet with you directly.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.082
It's just a formality.
- That wasn't the deal.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.388
- Their dope, their rules.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.868
Nothing I can do
to change his mind.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.130
- Okay,
we can talk about this later.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.696
It's time to go
get in place, okay?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.263
- Nina's right.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.308
Maggie just said
Octavio left the house,

29:48.395 --> 29:49.744
and he's flying solo.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.224
He should be here
in less than 10 minutes.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.402
- Hey, Octavio
is changing the plan.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.925
He wants to set another meeting
to see the cash

29:57.012 --> 29:58.535
before he arranges
the meeting with El Perro.

29:58.622 --> 29:59.928
- That's not good.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.103
Sounds like El Perro
is getting cold feet.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.018
- Yeah,
but it's our only option.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.891
We have to play it out, right?
- No, it's not.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.328
DNA came back
on Octavio's saliva.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.721
It's a match.
Looks like he's our killer.

30:16.205 --> 30:19.034
- I'm tired of the games.
- Ain't no game.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.080
Our boss just wants proof.
That's all.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.038
- Well, trust
is a two-way street.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.867
You show me the product,
I'll show you my cash.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.174
- Money ain't illegal, dope is.

30:28.261 --> 30:30.263
Means I'd be taking
all the risk.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.445
Who the hell is he?
I don't like surprises.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.449
- He's with me.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.151
- Tell him
to bring it over here.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.719
I want to see it up close.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.764
- Not until I see the product.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.724
- You're a serious lady.
I like that.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.468
- What's that for?
- El Perro.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.426
He'll meet you in Queens
at45,

31:03.513 --> 31:05.733
just you and the cash.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.778
He sees anyone
who's not in this picture,

31:07.866 --> 31:10.216
and the deal's off.

31:10.303 --> 31:13.219
- So you won't be there?
- My job here is done.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.707
- He's changing the plan again.
- I don't like it.

31:23.794 --> 31:24.883
There's too many things
that can go wrong

31:24.970 --> 31:25.927
if we have to wait
until tonight.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.537
- Yeah.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.626
- Scola.
- Isobel, what's up?

31:29.713 --> 31:31.672
- Take Octavio down now.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.456
- I thought we were going to--
- Change of plans.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.502
Murder trumps drugs.
End of debate.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.862
- FBI!

31:57.176 --> 31:58.612
- Ah!

32:18.197 --> 32:19.111
- Okay.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.550
- What the hell was that?

32:23.637 --> 32:26.292
We had a deal.
You gave me your word.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.207
- I know that,
and I am sorry, okay?

32:28.294 --> 32:29.860
But this was not my call.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.124
Nina, this came from the SAC.
The plan kept changing.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.777
Octavio was not
buying your cover.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.257
- What happened
to you having my back

32:35.344 --> 32:37.259
and all that crap
that you said, huh?

32:37.346 --> 32:39.348
Or what, was this
the plan all along?

32:39.435 --> 32:40.959
Let's see what
Nina can uncover.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.961
We'll wait for the DNA,
then we'll make the arrest.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.920
- Like I said,
Isobel got spoo--

32:46.007 --> 32:48.140
- Go to hell.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.844
- Great, thank you.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.802
Hey, great news,
Octavio's lawyer says

32:58.889 --> 33:00.065
he wants to cooperate.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.631
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.720
I'm gonna have you grab Tiff,
go interrogate this punk

33:03.807 --> 33:04.939
and find out what he knows

33:05.026 --> 33:06.114
and what he is
willing to give up.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.725
And Scola, listen, um,

33:08.812 --> 33:11.424
I am really sorry
about the mix-up with Nina.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.773
There were too many variables.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.775
I couldn't risk Octavio
taking off.

33:19.084 --> 33:23.349
- We hear you wanna talk?
- Yeah, we wanna make a deal.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.959
- Your client killed two people
in cold blood

33:25.046 --> 33:26.482
in a federal park.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.006
He's staring down
a life sentence,

33:28.093 --> 33:30.704
so I don't think
you have much leverage.

33:30.791 --> 33:33.750
- But we're willing to listen,
hear what you have to say.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.492
- Okay, then so
this is all off the table.

33:36.579 --> 33:37.841
Queen for a day
until we make a deal.

33:37.928 --> 33:38.842
Agreed?

33:38.929 --> 33:40.018
- Sure.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.718
- Okay.
Tell them what happened.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.068
Nothing you say
can be used against you

33:47.155 --> 33:48.374
if we don't make a deal.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.467
- Look, I killed those two kids

33:54.554 --> 33:56.512
cause El Perro
told me to do it.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.036
He said
we couldn't take the risk

33:58.123 --> 33:59.733
of that girl overdosing.
- Come on.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.909
He forced you to kill 'em?
You could do better than that.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.693
- He's the boss, man.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.434
If I don't do what he says,
then I get killed,

34:05.521 --> 34:07.132
- But we need more evidence.

34:07.219 --> 34:10.396
- I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll call him on the phone.

34:10.483 --> 34:14.095
I'll wear a wire. You name it.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.836
I'll roll his ass up
on these murders.

34:15.923 --> 34:18.230
Five or six more
plus the drugs.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.711
I know it all, man.
I know names, addresses.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.237
I know where
the bodies are buried.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.940
- All right, we're gonna
need to discuss this

34:33.027 --> 34:34.333
with
the U.S. Attorney's office,

34:34.420 --> 34:37.771
but if you're telling
the truth,

34:37.858 --> 34:39.599
I'm thinking a deal
can be made here.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.169
Oh, and since you're
coming clean and all,

34:44.256 --> 34:45.605
I got one more question
for you.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.433
- Fire away.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.217
- You know, that woman
that you met with,

34:49.304 --> 34:51.306
uh, Nina,
drug dealer from Canada?

34:51.393 --> 34:53.352
- What about her?

34:53.439 --> 34:56.006
- Were you really planning
on introducing her to El Perro,

34:56.094 --> 34:57.312
doing business with her?

35:03.188 --> 35:05.059
- Nina it's me, Scola.
Listen to me.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.756
Call me
when you get the message.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.541
It's important, all right?
We just sat down with Octavio.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.934
Do not reach out to El Perro.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.762
Do not meet up with him
under any circumstances.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.025
He is not planning
on selling to you, Nina.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.071
He's gonna rob you
and kill you.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.420
Call me.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.771
- Hey, went to voicemail?
- Yeah.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.817
I mean, I could try it again.
She's not gonna take my calls.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.167
- Let me try.
- We got to find her.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.777
All right, you keep trying her.
- Yeah.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.518
- I'm gonna track down
her supervisor.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.955
He should have access
to her GPS.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.092
- Okay, her car is
two blocks east on 88th street.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.485
- Moving?

35:41.530 --> 35:43.967
- It just stopped.
- Not good.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.317
Means she's probably meeting up
with someone.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.374
- Hey, I see them.
Should we lay low until--

35:59.461 --> 36:03.204
- We don't have time for that.
Nina, yo, we need to talk.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.771
- Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

36:04.858 --> 36:06.251
- Are you meeting El Perro?

36:06.338 --> 36:07.469
- Yes, you need to get
the hell outta here.

36:07.556 --> 36:08.905
He's planning to rob you.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.298
- What are you talking about?

36:10.385 --> 36:12.866
- Guys,
I think we have a company.

36:21.570 --> 36:24.182
- I said just you.
No one else.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.358
- FBI, do not move.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.235
- Covering!

36:36.019 --> 36:38.587
- Covering!
- Covering!

36:41.677 --> 36:43.244
- Covering!
- Go, go, go!

36:45.942 --> 36:48.336
Come on! Come over here. Come.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.070
- This is Special Agent
Tiffany Wallace.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.420
We have three people shot
at the corner

37:28.507 --> 37:29.899
of 89th and Relling.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.640
we need medical assistance now.

38:03.542 --> 38:08.634
- Hey, you okay?
How's Gomez?

38:08.721 --> 38:10.766
- He's fine for now.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.115
The doctor said
he got really lucky.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.292
Bullets missed
all of his major organs.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.423
- That's good news.

38:18.557 --> 38:22.474
Look, I know that this didn't
go down like you hoped,

38:22.561 --> 38:24.084
and I'm sorry about...

38:25.955 --> 38:27.174
I should have called you

38:27.261 --> 38:30.133
and told you
what was going on with me.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.484
- We already did this.
Can we just move on, please?

38:32.571 --> 38:35.138
- I'm serious, okay?
I've changed.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.879
- That's fantastic.
I gotta go.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.883
- Let's have dinner.
- What?

38:40.970 --> 38:42.232
- Let me buy you dinner.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.714
- No, I'm good.
- Come on, Nina.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.760
I just want to have dinner
and talk.

38:47.847 --> 38:48.804
That's it.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.943
For God's sake,
I just saved your life.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.292
The least you could let me do

38:58.379 --> 39:00.903
is buy you a piece of fish
or something.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.259
- Okay.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.219
Come on.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.832
- You're not buying me
a piece of fish, okay?

39:16.919 --> 39:18.486
I want a steak.
