WEBVTT

01:03.297 --> 01:06.466
I'd hate to be flying
in this weather.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.269
I am taking you to
the airport, right?

01:10.170 --> 01:11.405
I was just joking.

01:12.941 --> 01:14.642
I'm heading home.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.343
Well, actually, I'm heading
to a beach rental

01:16.410 --> 01:17.912
that's right near my home, so...

01:17.979 --> 01:19.313
Okay.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.271
Hey, honey.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.542
You're on in the car.
Say hi to everyone.

01:47.609 --> 01:48.843
Hello, everybody.

01:48.910 --> 01:50.912
Hi.

01:50.979 --> 01:52.714
Tuck...

01:54.549 --> 01:56.551
Can you say hi
to your dad, please?

01:56.618 --> 01:58.886
Oh, hey, Dad!

01:58.953 --> 02:00.153
Your plane about to take off?

02:00.220 --> 02:02.657
No, no.
I'm not gonna make it.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.559
Are you serious?

02:04.626 --> 02:05.927
Wait.

02:05.994 --> 02:08.029
You're not gonna be able
to make it to the beach house?

02:08.096 --> 02:09.664
Are you tied up with work?

02:09.731 --> 02:11.966
No, no, I'm coming.
I'm coming to the beach house.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.400
But the flight was delayed.
The weather's terrible.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.302
So I'm just gonna
have this driver

02:15.369 --> 02:17.204
take me to a car rental hub

02:17.270 --> 02:19.807
and then I'm just gonna
drive myself down.

02:19.874 --> 02:22.142
I don't want you to drive.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.444
You said that it
was pouring up there.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.346
Yeah, but I'm just gonna
take the 5 Freeway.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.116
I'll be a straight
shot down south.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.217
I wanna be there in
about six hours,

02:30.283 --> 02:32.252
two if I start to hydroplane.

02:33.688 --> 02:36.891
Well, if you need to stop,
don't forget about Coalinga.

02:36.958 --> 02:38.392
No way, no, no, no.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.727
It's been 12 long days
without everybody.

02:39.794 --> 02:42.429
I miss you guys too much,
even your dad.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.398
Oh, honey, one more thing.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.433
Please make sure that
Mr. Hamilton fixed those leaks.

02:46.501 --> 02:48.002
Because if this weather
heads south,

02:48.069 --> 02:49.771
I don't wanna be walking
through a houseful of buckets

02:49.837 --> 02:51.739
like we did
last summer, okay?

02:51.806 --> 02:53.306
Yeah. On it.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.742
All right.
Love 'ya.

02:54.809 --> 02:56.410
Love you, too!

03:08.422 --> 03:09.957
Here it is.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.528
Yeah.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.798
Listen, I put these
walls up myself.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.635
Leaky pipes.

03:27.809 --> 03:30.678
My neighbors
called you, right?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.349
Let's see outside structures.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.854
Okay.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.468
So do I get a copy of this
when you're done?

03:54.535 --> 03:56.204
Up to the City Council.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.740
Here. Sign this.

04:02.043 --> 04:05.747
Seriously? C'mon!

04:05.813 --> 04:07.882
Half of this stuff is cosmetic,
and you know it.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.720
Since when am I not allowed
to have a breaker box

04:12.787 --> 04:15.223
-on the property?
-Not on the roof.

04:15.288 --> 04:18.425
I'm installing solar.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.695
You're stealing cable.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.498
Cable's expensive.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.004
You can't rent this property
out again

04:30.071 --> 04:32.039
until you finish all the fixes.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.407
You can schedule a meeting
with the City Council

04:34.474 --> 04:37.344
to request some exceptions
and some continuances.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.980
Here.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.288
Hamilton Beach Rentals.
Henry Hamilton speaking.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.457
<i>Henry, it's Lacey Samson.</i>

04:50.525 --> 04:52.627
Ah, Mrs. Samson, how are you?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.862
It's hard to believe
it's been a year, huh?

04:54.929 --> 04:56.396
<i>I know, I know!</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:58.166
I hope everything's good.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.534
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.301
We're running a little bit late.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.937
Hudson and I wanted
to make sure that

05:03.004 --> 05:04.972
that you fixed all the leaks
from last summer.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.373
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.242
I replaced those
with, uh, copper pipes.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.877
My man Rowan did it.

05:09.944 --> 05:11.145
Oh, good, great.

05:11.212 --> 05:12.847
I like Rowan.

05:12.914 --> 05:16.316
Also, I'm having a package
delivered to the condo.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.417
Have you seen it?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.254
I got a package here.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.657
Yeah, I got it.
It's in my hands.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.793
Great. Just make sure you
bring it in before it rains.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.161
<i>Rain?</i>

05:27.228 --> 05:29.429
Come on, it's not gonna rain!

05:29.496 --> 05:30.798
<i>Really?</i>

05:30.865 --> 05:32.432
That's not what
the weather app says.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.569
Aw, nonsense.
Are you kidding me?

05:34.635 --> 05:37.171
I should be charging you
more for this weather.

05:37.238 --> 05:38.506
It's gonna be beautiful.

05:38.573 --> 05:39.941
You and your
family are gonna have

05:40.007 --> 05:42.210
<i>a great month here,</i>
<i>I guarantee.</i>

05:42.276 --> 05:43.511
Oh, that's great to hear.

05:43.578 --> 05:45.513
Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.515
Hey, we'll be there soon, okay?

05:47.582 --> 05:48.883
<i>Happy travels!</i>

05:50.251 --> 05:51.484
Oh, shit!

05:53.120 --> 05:55.156
Okay, bye.

05:55.223 --> 05:57.390
Shit.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
Son of a bitch.

06:37.999 --> 06:40.167
Help!

06:40.234 --> 06:41.702
Shark!

07:23.144 --> 07:25.846
Thanks for letting us
borrow your car, Dad.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.859
Tuck, get my walker, will ya?

07:41.662 --> 07:44.966
Tucker.
Pop the back, will ya?

07:46.734 --> 07:49.737
Every summer, we've come here
since you were a babies.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.872
I'm going to miss it.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.910
Well, college isn't year round.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.511
I'll be home in the summer.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.981
Yeah, but college
and then medical school

08:00.047 --> 08:02.750
and then post-graduate school
and then...

08:02.817 --> 08:06.687
Do you not want me to be
a doctor like grandpa?

08:06.754 --> 08:08.656
I want everything for
you and your brother.

08:10.358 --> 08:12.660
All right, you guys. I don't
wanna make more than one trip,

08:12.727 --> 08:14.795
so let's try and
get everything, okay?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.167
Mom.

08:21.836 --> 08:23.471
Yes! A new record!

08:23.537 --> 08:27.942
Tuck, either help with stuff
in the back or grandpa, okay?

08:28.009 --> 08:29.577
You can't just stand there.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.081
-Wha-- ok.
-I don't need any help.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.618
All right, luggage it is.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.987
-I got it.
-Be careful.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.756
Be careful.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.862
Hey, hey, hey!
I thought that was you!

08:47.928 --> 08:49.697
You guys coming or going?

08:49.764 --> 08:51.966
Well, we're just arriving.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.201
I thought you were gonna be
at your Cabo house this summer.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.971
Yeah, well, I had to stick
in town for a big case.

08:57.038 --> 08:59.106
You guys staying for
a whole month again?

08:59.173 --> 09:01.809
As always.

09:01.876 --> 09:04.745
Hey, where's my man, Hudson?

09:04.812 --> 09:07.448
He's driving in
from San Francisco.

09:07.516 --> 09:09.183
Hey, Tad.
Is Becky around?

09:09.250 --> 09:12.119
You stay away from her, Tucker.
I see that look in your eye.

09:12.186 --> 09:14.523
Wha-- What? What?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.223
What?
She's my daughter.

09:16.290 --> 09:20.127
Tad, they've been friends
since they were kids,

09:20.194 --> 09:22.630
ever since you got
the condo next door.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.998
Yeah.

09:24.065 --> 09:24.999
She swimming?

09:25.066 --> 09:26.434
Yeah.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.402
I was hoping I could catch her
before the Santa Anas kicked in.

09:28.469 --> 09:31.572
But I guess I'll just drive
around a little bit.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.907
Listen, if you guys see her,

09:32.973 --> 09:35.076
tell her to take
a rideshare back

09:35.142 --> 09:36.477
to the Palisades house,
all right?

09:36.545 --> 09:37.745
Not her mother's place.

09:37.812 --> 09:39.647
Oh, and honestly,
you better think

09:39.713 --> 09:41.215
about going back to the city.

09:41.282 --> 09:43.050
They say the storm's gonna
get pretty bad tonight.

09:43.117 --> 09:46.620
You might lose electricity
and what are you gonna do

09:46.687 --> 09:50.458
if you can't watch
your precious sports?

09:50.525 --> 09:52.226
Ciao!

09:56.931 --> 09:58.732
Are we going back?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.236
Here we go.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.600
Come on, guys.

10:31.665 --> 10:35.002
Look at this, Lace,
if the house looks like this...

10:39.240 --> 10:41.041
Enough.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.879
I told you this is gonna be a
disaster just like last summer.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.149
How many times did
the electricity go out?

10:48.215 --> 10:50.751
Dad, just go inside,
I've got to make a call, okay?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.686
Mm-hmm.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.933
Can I get the room
upstairs this time?

11:38.999 --> 11:41.302
No way.
You had it last year.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.405
It could be your
graduation present to me.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.073
Really?

11:46.140 --> 11:50.344
Okay, sure, it's yours.
That was easy.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.042
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:24.679 --> 12:28.382
You know, I know I gave you a
hard time about coming here.

12:28.449 --> 12:34.556
But thank you for carrying
on this fine summer tradition.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.924
Your mom?

12:36.991 --> 12:38.425
She'd be proud.

12:42.062 --> 12:45.533
It's not gonna be the same once
Charlotte goes off to college.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.201
It's okay, things change.

12:47.268 --> 12:49.203
You adapt.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.238
It's not always about the place.

12:54.709 --> 12:59.480
You know, I know it
would be a beast

12:59.547 --> 13:02.149
if we try it, but what if...

13:02.216 --> 13:07.187
What if we rented a boat
next week,

13:07.254 --> 13:09.890
a fishing boat,
just you and me,

13:09.957 --> 13:13.460
and we went out fishing
just like when you were a kid?

13:13.528 --> 13:15.996
-Dad, no.
-What?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.865
It would be too hard for you.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.567
We haven't done it since--

13:19.634 --> 13:23.337
Just because I'm old doesn't
mean I can't do things.

13:28.576 --> 13:29.810
All right, I'll make you a deal.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.145
Okay.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.981
If the weather
clears by Tuesday,

13:34.048 --> 13:35.617
I'll go fishing with you.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.919
But I don't wanna hear any
complaining, okay?

13:40.354 --> 13:42.222
Not even one.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.834
-Oh, boy.
-You okay?

13:53.901 --> 13:55.235
-Yeah.

14:01.075 --> 14:02.744
I'm hungry.

14:02.811 --> 14:04.378
Where's the sandwiches?

14:07.782 --> 14:10.552
Has anyone seen the package
that was delivered for me?

14:10.618 --> 14:12.152
No, Mom.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.354
Huh.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.590
Well, if you find it,
give it to me.

14:15.657 --> 14:17.858
Don't open it
'cause it's a surprise.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.426
Looks like Mom found
another game

14:19.493 --> 14:21.462
for game night that
no one will wanna play.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.498
You just wait and see.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.242
Think I'm gonna go swimming
in a bit.

14:35.309 --> 14:38.780
It'll be my last chance
before this storm comes in.

14:38.847 --> 14:40.749
With Becky?

14:40.815 --> 14:42.082
Nope.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.419
I thought you didn't
like swimming.

14:45.486 --> 14:47.921
I don't like water polo.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.057
It's a big difference.

14:50.124 --> 14:52.226
Yeah, I don't know, Tuck.
This weather is--

14:52.292 --> 14:54.696
It's what I've been training in
for like the last five summers

14:54.763 --> 14:57.064
in a row here at this beach.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.099
With lifeguards watching.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.535
I don't see anyone
out there today.

15:00.602 --> 15:03.303
I know the drills.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.540
Look, did you want me to do
water polo again or not?

15:05.607 --> 15:08.543
I thought you were gonna join
the Chess Club?

15:11.945 --> 15:14.783
Okay.
60 minutes tops.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.317
-If--
-Mom, I got this.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.754
I'm fine.
Just leave it alone.

15:19.821 --> 15:21.021
All right.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.157
Steak or chicken for dinner?

15:24.726 --> 15:26.260
Uh... fish?

15:27.729 --> 15:29.564
That was the plan.

15:29.631 --> 15:31.131
See 'ya.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.170
You let the boy go swimming,

15:36.236 --> 15:38.205
but you give me a
hard time about fishing?

15:38.272 --> 15:39.808
Don't twist my words.

15:39.874 --> 15:41.509
We're still gonna go next week

15:41.576 --> 15:44.411
if you're feeling up for it
and weather permitting, okay?

15:46.380 --> 15:48.482
Oh...

15:48.550 --> 15:49.751
The TV went out!

15:49.818 --> 15:51.985
You know, we're here for
barely two seconds...

15:52.052 --> 15:54.054
I'll check the breaker.

16:20.748 --> 16:22.082
Great.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.563
Thank you.

16:35.630 --> 16:39.299
Come on, Cubs.
Come back to me, Cubs.

16:55.817 --> 16:58.553
Damn it, Hamilton!
You said you fixed the leaks!

17:13.166 --> 17:14.769
Hello?

17:14.836 --> 17:19.541
Hey, Mr. Rowan,
it's Lacey Samson. Hi.

17:19.607 --> 17:23.678
Hey, Mrs. Samson.
It must be summertime.

17:23.745 --> 17:25.412
Is there any way that
you can come here?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.682
We've been trying
to reach Mr. Hamilton

17:27.749 --> 17:29.416
and he's not picking up.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.686
Have you talked to him today?

17:31.753 --> 17:32.987
<i>No.</i>

17:33.086 --> 17:34.789
Do you know
if he's still around?

17:34.856 --> 17:37.825
No. I haven't done any work
for Mr. Hamilton in a while.

17:37.892 --> 17:40.895
He said you put in copper pipes.

17:40.962 --> 17:42.664
No, no.

17:42.730 --> 17:45.132
He hasn't called me and
talked to me about that.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.602
I should have known.

17:47.669 --> 17:50.004
But is there any way
that you can come by here?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.873
This month is really important

17:51.940 --> 17:54.274
because this is the last time
our family's gonna be together

17:54.341 --> 17:55.877
before my daughter
goes off to college.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.579
And I just...

17:57.645 --> 18:02.249
we wanna make it memorable
and everything here is messy.

18:02.316 --> 18:03.818
I don't think Mr. Hamilton
would want me

18:03.885 --> 18:05.285
coming out there right now.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.688
Oh, don't worry about him.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.723
We're gonna pay you
directly, okay?

18:08.790 --> 18:12.125
No, this weather's
getting really bad.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.828
Look, I'm gonna pay you double.

18:13.895 --> 18:16.463
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

18:16.531 --> 18:21.335
I just really need your help
because the pipes are leaking.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.871
And the basement is flooded.

18:23.938 --> 18:25.372
I don't know what to do.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.643
All right, just for you.

18:28.710 --> 18:30.377
I will be out there.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.946
I'll make it my last stop
on the way home.

18:32.013 --> 18:35.182
Hey, but you know, my wife
has not stopped raving

18:35.248 --> 18:37.317
about those lemon bars
you made us last year.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.319
Okay.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.388
I'll make sure you get some
before you go home.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.123
<i>No, you don't have to do that.</i>

18:43.190 --> 18:44.291
It will be my pleasure.

18:44.358 --> 18:46.460
<i>Okay, you won me over.</i>

18:46.527 --> 18:48.128
All right, girl.
We'll see you later on.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.064
Thank you.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.666
Thank you, Mr. Rowan.

18:54.102 --> 18:56.136
I thought you fixed the leaks.

19:07.682 --> 19:09.083
Wow!

19:09.149 --> 19:10.384
You've grown since last summer!

19:10.450 --> 19:12.820
Two inches, actually.

19:12.887 --> 19:14.722
Yeah, only two?

19:21.095 --> 19:22.664
My summer fling's
all grown up.

19:22.730 --> 19:27.234
You know it doesn't have
to always be a summer fling.

19:28.102 --> 19:29.771
He's getting forward, too.

19:29.837 --> 19:31.806
Tuck's all grown up.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.047
Your dad was looking
for you earlier.

19:39.113 --> 19:40.682
Yeah, I know.

19:40.748 --> 19:42.517
He's trying to get us all
inside because of the storm.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.184
But I know that he's just
trying to show off his daughter

19:44.251 --> 19:45.385
to his new girlfriend, so...

19:45.452 --> 19:47.421
He seemed pretty worried.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.693
Yeah, well, I'm not really
here to talk about my dad.

19:55.429 --> 19:57.031
We're going swimming?

19:57.098 --> 19:58.331
That was the plan, right?

19:59.100 --> 20:00.968
Well, the weather...

20:01.035 --> 20:02.570
You sound like my dad.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.208
I thought maybe we could
do some other things.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.211
What? Are you afraid of
a little water?

20:12.180 --> 20:13.948
-I'm half-fish.
-Come on.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.922
Hey! Wait up!

20:31.364 --> 20:33.400
The pipes, huh?

20:33.467 --> 20:35.402
Don't get me started.

20:35.469 --> 20:37.572
Rowan's coming by to fix it now.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.707
Good. At least he knows
what he's doing.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.852
Tucker!

20:52.754 --> 20:53.788
Tucker!

21:00.094 --> 21:01.929
Tucker!

21:01.996 --> 21:03.965
Tucker!

21:04.031 --> 21:05.465
Tucker!

21:06.968 --> 21:08.936
Tucker!

21:10.437 --> 21:11.906
Charlotte-- oh!

21:11.973 --> 21:12.974
Um...

21:13.040 --> 21:15.176
I guess Tucker found Becky.

21:15.243 --> 21:16.443
Yeah, I guess.
Can you go get them?

21:16.511 --> 21:18.212
Because the wind is picking up,

21:18.278 --> 21:21.916
and her dad is looking for her.
They shouldn't be out there.

21:21.983 --> 21:24.786
I'll be down in a minute.
I need to change.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.831
Come on!

21:36.898 --> 21:38.431
Come on!

21:42.069 --> 21:43.303
You're going too far out.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.806
Tide's too high!

21:44.872 --> 21:46.741
You play it
way too safe, Tuck!

21:46.808 --> 21:48.576
I play it smart!

21:48.643 --> 21:52.312
Yeah, and where did smart
ever get you?

21:56.250 --> 21:57.417
Ra!

21:57.484 --> 21:58.953
Cut it out!

22:15.402 --> 22:17.705
Tucker!

22:17.772 --> 22:20.340
Tucker, come on!
Mom wants you in!

22:27.915 --> 22:29.349
Mom?

22:30.618 --> 22:32.887
There's a package
with your name on it!

22:34.789 --> 22:36.991
Oh, great.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.459
Guess it did get delivered.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.531
The wind must have
knocked it over.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.834
Thanks.

22:51.606 --> 22:53.641
Make sure your brother
comes in.

22:54.609 --> 22:56.611
Tucker, come on!

23:02.984 --> 23:04.552
Shark.

23:04.619 --> 23:06.954
Oh my God... Oh my God!

23:07.021 --> 23:10.124
Shark! Shark!

23:11.559 --> 23:15.263
Tucker! Shark! Shark!

23:15.329 --> 23:18.032
Tucker, come on!
Come in!

23:18.099 --> 23:20.768
Hi, Charlotte!

23:23.470 --> 23:25.706
Now! Now!

23:29.110 --> 23:30.244
Where are you going?

23:30.311 --> 23:32.412
Come back, there's a shark!

23:35.383 --> 23:37.118
Tucker, come in!

23:41.289 --> 23:42.623
Tucker!

23:42.690 --> 23:44.025
You sister really wants
you to come in.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.760
Becky, hold up.

23:49.196 --> 23:52.233
-Is that a shark?
-What?

23:52.300 --> 23:53.367
Get to the shore!

23:53.433 --> 23:54.936
I'll distract it.

23:57.338 --> 23:59.340
Mom!

23:59.407 --> 24:00.908
Mind turning that down?

24:06.047 --> 24:08.448
I don't see it.

24:10.051 --> 24:11.719
Swim to the shore!

24:11.786 --> 24:13.754
Becky, swim! Swim!

24:22.863 --> 24:24.665
Swim, Becky!
Swim!

24:26.834 --> 24:28.002
Becky!

24:43.317 --> 24:45.119
- Becky!

25:08.342 --> 25:10.711
Honey?

25:10.778 --> 25:12.780
Hey, it's me.
Can you hear me?

25:15.449 --> 25:18.552
-Hello?
<i>-Honey, can you hear me?</i>

25:23.324 --> 25:25.426
Honey, I can't hear you.

25:25.493 --> 25:26.627
It's me.

25:26.694 --> 25:28.562
I'm just... honey?

25:28.629 --> 25:31.899
Yeah. The connection here,
it's terrible.

25:31.966 --> 25:33.300
I'm not gonna make it
for dinner, babe.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.335
I don't know if you can hear me.

25:34.402 --> 25:37.872
-What?
-Honey?

25:37.938 --> 25:39.673
Honey, just call me back.

25:41.510 --> 25:42.743
Hello?

25:44.011 --> 25:45.646
Hey, babe, I didn't know
if you could hear me before.

25:45.713 --> 25:46.781
But the rain is killing me
on travel time here,

25:46.847 --> 25:49.350
so go ahead and eat without me.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.985
I'm just gonna pick up
some food in Gorman

25:51.052 --> 25:52.920
and then I'll head
straight to you.

25:52.987 --> 25:54.288
I should be there a couple of
hours after that, all right?

25:54.355 --> 25:55.856
I love you.

25:58.726 --> 25:59.927
Is that Hudson?

25:59.994 --> 26:00.728
Yeah.

26:00.795 --> 26:02.396
Where is he?

26:02.463 --> 26:05.166
I can't hear anything, okay?
It's a bad connection.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.468
Becky!

26:07.536 --> 26:09.937
Becky, take my hand!
Take my hand!

26:12.339 --> 26:14.141
I got you, I got you!

26:14.208 --> 26:17.478
I've been bit!
I've been bit!

26:24.585 --> 26:25.619
You're going to be
okay, okay?

26:25.686 --> 26:27.421
You're going to be okay.

26:27.488 --> 26:29.123
Tucker, grab that shirt!

26:29.190 --> 26:30.324
Okay.

26:33.861 --> 26:36.597
We have to make it
back to the house!

26:36.664 --> 26:37.798
Can you walk?

26:37.865 --> 26:39.300
Yeah, I think.

26:40.367 --> 26:41.302
Help me up.

26:41.368 --> 26:42.369
Can you get Mom?

26:42.436 --> 26:43.971
We don't have time!

26:44.038 --> 26:46.907
We have to clean out the wound
before it gets infected!

26:52.079 --> 26:54.014
-Mom, help!
-Oh my God!

26:54.081 --> 26:57.885
-Honey! Oh my God!
-What?

26:57.952 --> 27:00.522
Oh, my God! Becky!

27:00.589 --> 27:02.223
There was another
body out there!

27:02.289 --> 27:03.224
It was too mangled...

27:03.290 --> 27:04.725
What, are you serious?

27:04.792 --> 27:06.627
Yes, you idiot!
That's why I was yelling at you!

27:06.694 --> 27:08.329
You guys, that's enough!

27:08.395 --> 27:09.797
What happened?

27:09.864 --> 27:11.198
A shark attacked her!

27:11.265 --> 27:13.535
A shark?
Oh my God!

27:13.602 --> 27:16.437
A shark?

27:16.505 --> 27:18.873
Easy, easy. A shark?

27:18.939 --> 27:20.074
You're okay,
you're gonna make it.

27:20.141 --> 27:21.675
Nice breaths, nice breaths.

27:21.742 --> 27:23.944
Oh, God...

27:24.011 --> 27:25.679
I think she's going
into shock.

27:25.746 --> 27:28.816
Charlotte, go get to the
kitchen, the bathroom.

27:28.883 --> 27:30.684
Get towels, rags,
rubbing alcohol,

27:30.751 --> 27:31.919
medicine, anything.

27:31.986 --> 27:33.354
Bring it back here.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.688
Tucker, elevate her legs.

27:34.755 --> 27:35.789
She's going into shock.

27:35.856 --> 27:37.324
You need to keep her warm.

27:37.391 --> 27:39.628
Honey, Becky, stay with us.
Stay with us, okay?

27:39.693 --> 27:40.995
It's not a good time
to go to sleep.

27:41.061 --> 27:43.664
She's going into shock.
Elevate her legs.

27:43.731 --> 27:45.666
Tucker, where's your phone?

27:45.733 --> 27:46.967
It's right there.

27:49.737 --> 27:51.372
There you go.
Charlotte?

27:51.438 --> 27:54.074
Charlotte, I need those rags!

27:54.141 --> 27:55.276
Tucker, just
keep calling, okay?

27:55.342 --> 27:56.310
She's got blood loss.

27:56.377 --> 27:57.778
It has like one bar on it.

27:57.845 --> 27:59.180
I know, it doesn't matter,
just keep calling.

28:00.181 --> 28:02.483
Oh, the package.

28:02.551 --> 28:03.751
I couldn't find anything else.

28:03.817 --> 28:04.752
Attagirl!
That's okay!

28:04.818 --> 28:06.153
Tear the rags!

28:19.500 --> 28:21.402
Tucker, get that off there.

28:24.805 --> 28:26.840
Right here, sweetie.
Look at me.

28:26.907 --> 28:28.342
-Face me.
-What's that, Mom?

28:28.409 --> 28:30.844
It's a surprise for you,
your graduation gift.

28:30.911 --> 28:32.413
It's a medical bag just
like your grandpa had...

28:32.479 --> 28:34.516
vintage, but its not
a surprise any longer.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.817
No, it's great.
Thank you.

28:38.285 --> 28:41.455
Get the driftwood?
Any piece of stick, a stick!

28:48.329 --> 28:50.197
You said you haven't
been drinking!

28:52.967 --> 28:54.301
A little sting,
a little sting, honey.

28:54.368 --> 28:56.270
What's happening?
What's happening?

28:56.337 --> 28:58.739
That's good, that's good.
That means she's with us.

28:58.806 --> 28:59.840
What's going on?

28:59.907 --> 29:01.676
Adrenalin, blood loss...

29:01.742 --> 29:03.244
Is she gonna be okay?

29:03.310 --> 29:04.945
You're good.
We'll take care of her.

29:05.012 --> 29:06.947
Tighten around the tourniquet!

29:08.249 --> 29:09.483
We have to take her
to a hospital, right?

29:09.551 --> 29:10.884
Grandpa can handle it!

29:10.951 --> 29:14.054
No, grandpa is
a retired pediatrician.

29:14.121 --> 29:17.858
What this girl needs
is a hospital.

29:19.527 --> 29:21.128
Everyone get their things.

29:21.195 --> 29:23.565
We are leaving and we're gonna
take her to the hospital.

29:24.865 --> 29:26.467
Is that Dad?

29:26.534 --> 29:28.902
He's driving from San Francisco
and he left like two hours ago.

29:30.605 --> 29:31.606
Count three.
Spin it.

29:31.673 --> 29:32.607
What happened?

29:32.674 --> 29:33.608
It was a shark attack!

29:33.675 --> 29:35.276
What can I help you with?

29:35.342 --> 29:37.278
It's okay. We're leaving
for the hospital right now.

29:37.344 --> 29:38.613
You guys need
to leave right now!

29:38.680 --> 29:40.582
They're shutting down the PCH!

29:40.649 --> 29:42.617
I can fix everything
over here at the house.

29:42.684 --> 29:44.586
Mom, what about Dad?

29:44.653 --> 29:45.953
We'll try calling him
from the car, okay?

29:46.020 --> 29:47.221
Good job, Dad.

29:47.288 --> 29:49.456
Let's get this tourniquet on.

29:49.524 --> 29:51.225
I don't think we're coming back.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.493
You don't need to fix the
leaks if you don't want to.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.228
I'll be okay.

29:54.295 --> 29:56.397
You guys take care of your
family and get outta here safe!

29:56.463 --> 29:57.431
Okay, will do.

29:57.498 --> 29:59.400
Go! Take her.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.503
Keep her elevated!
Keep her elevated!

30:01.569 --> 30:03.571
Keep her level!

30:03.638 --> 30:05.239
You got her?
You got her?

30:05.306 --> 30:06.508
Okay.

30:29.531 --> 30:31.065
Damn!

30:59.893 --> 31:01.395
Yeah, go!

31:01.462 --> 31:02.597
What if Dad gets here
and we're not here?

31:02.664 --> 31:04.298
We have to call him.

31:04.365 --> 31:06.266
He'll be fine, okay? We just
have to take care of Becky.

31:19.848 --> 31:22.483
Ah! Damn.

31:27.789 --> 31:29.890
Oh, shit!

31:39.433 --> 31:42.469
Yeah, yeah, I got
something for that ass.

31:50.712 --> 31:52.413
Ah!

31:53.681 --> 31:56.383
Is everyone okay?

31:56.450 --> 31:57.752
I'm okay!

31:57.819 --> 32:00.254
Don't... Don't touch the wires!
They're hot!

32:00.320 --> 32:01.656
Charlotte, honey,
try the door.

32:01.723 --> 32:02.657
The door won't open!

32:02.724 --> 32:04.925
Tucker, is Becky okay?

32:04.992 --> 32:06.661
She's hanging in there, grandpa!

32:06.728 --> 32:08.962
Mom, the doors won't open!

32:09.864 --> 32:11.866
Lace, give Charlotte the key!

32:11.932 --> 32:13.467
Maybe we can wedge it out!

32:13.535 --> 32:17.204
Charlotte, jump over
and try and start the car!

32:18.238 --> 32:20.642
Be careful!
Watch those wires!

32:25.345 --> 32:26.815
Mom, It's not starting!

32:26.881 --> 32:28.482
We need to get Becky
to the hospital!

32:28.550 --> 32:29.818
I don't want her to die!

32:29.884 --> 32:31.853
She's not gonna die!

32:31.920 --> 32:34.254
Keep trying!
Ease off the gas.

32:34.321 --> 32:35.857
Okay.

32:35.924 --> 32:37.357
It's not working.
It's stuck.

32:37.424 --> 32:39.426
Come on, Charlotte,
do something!

32:39.493 --> 32:42.963
Look, it's not stuck!
The car is just damaged!

32:43.030 --> 32:46.801
We're fine!
We'll find another way out!

32:46.868 --> 32:48.302
You got it?

32:52.139 --> 32:53.675
I'll be right back!

32:58.479 --> 33:00.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:01.114 --> 33:02.983
Shit.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.489
No, no, no, no...

33:20.768 --> 33:22.637
Damn it, there's no key!

33:35.550 --> 33:38.485
Everyone, you need
to take cover!

33:38.553 --> 33:40.487
Everyone clear!

33:42.256 --> 33:44.191
Mom, what are you--

33:44.258 --> 33:45.425
Take cover!

33:45.492 --> 33:46.761
Stay away from the window!

33:50.532 --> 33:51.966
Come on!

33:52.032 --> 33:53.735
Come on!

33:53.801 --> 33:55.168
Okay.

33:57.005 --> 33:59.373
Get out of the car!
Come on!

34:00.340 --> 34:02.010
Everybody out! Out!

34:02.075 --> 34:04.579
Help with Becky!

34:04.646 --> 34:06.981
-Oh...
-Grandpa, get out of the way.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.850
Come, Tucker!

34:08.917 --> 34:11.151
Come on, Tucker.

34:11.218 --> 34:12.787
-Help me, Tucker.
-I got you.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.226
Come on, this way.

34:21.029 --> 34:23.463
You need to help Becky now.

34:51.059 --> 34:53.661
Not today. Not today.

35:00.735 --> 35:04.806
Ahh! Ahh!

35:20.153 --> 35:21.355
Becky?
How are you doing?

35:21.421 --> 35:23.223
Hanging in there.

35:24.324 --> 35:25.860
Seems like the bleeding stopped.

35:25.927 --> 35:28.128
I know it hurts, Becky.

35:28.195 --> 35:32.165
There should be an
ambulance available soon.

35:50.752 --> 35:52.452
Do you think
Dad's gonna be okay?

35:54.922 --> 35:57.692
Tucker, help your grandpa
on the couch now!

35:59.393 --> 36:01.529
I got you, Dad, I got you!

36:05.432 --> 36:07.869
Here!
Here, here, here!

36:07.935 --> 36:09.269
Thank you.

36:09.336 --> 36:12.172
Dad, are you okay?

36:12.239 --> 36:14.341
Are you okay?
Dad, are you okay?

36:14.408 --> 36:16.176
There you go.

36:17.578 --> 36:20.615
Okay, Tucker, I need
you to get grandpa

36:20.682 --> 36:22.249
and Becky
some water now, okay?

36:22.315 --> 36:25.553
Mr. Rowan, we're back!

36:25.620 --> 36:28.388
I need you to tell Mr. Rowan
that we're back, okay?

36:28.455 --> 36:30.758
Becky, you're so strong.

36:30.825 --> 36:32.325
You're doing great.

36:32.392 --> 36:34.194
You okay, Dad?

36:34.261 --> 36:35.596
Mr. Rowan?

36:35.663 --> 36:37.665
Hello?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.233
-Mom?
-Thank you, thank you.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.836
Good job, good job.

36:41.903 --> 36:43.571
I got you.

36:43.638 --> 36:44.839
Good job, Dad,
drink this water.

36:44.906 --> 36:46.140
You're doing great.

36:46.206 --> 36:47.775
Tucker, please try 911 again.

36:54.182 --> 36:55.783
Tucker!

36:55.850 --> 36:58.285
You gotta see this!
Tucker!

37:03.091 --> 37:07.394
What?
Oh my God, it's flooded!

37:08.996 --> 37:10.098
Dad's gonna be pissed.

37:10.164 --> 37:11.699
You think?

37:12.700 --> 37:14.635
Man, this place is gonna sink!

37:16.369 --> 37:18.371
Mr. Rowan?

37:18.438 --> 37:20.307
Do you think he hurt himself?

37:20.373 --> 37:22.877
I don't know.
Let's see.

37:23.678 --> 37:25.813
Don't get in the water!

37:26.848 --> 37:28.683
Stay there.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.754
Grab the flashlight
so we can find him.

37:33.521 --> 37:35.288
He could be hurt.

37:35.355 --> 37:36.824
You okay?

37:38.025 --> 37:39.292
Dad, just breathe.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.781
Oh my God!

38:01.549 --> 38:05.987
Tuck, I felt something.

38:06.053 --> 38:08.055
Yeah, there's a lot of junk
floating around.

38:08.122 --> 38:09.590
Wait...

38:09.657 --> 38:10.992
I found the flashlight.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.426
I got it.

38:15.129 --> 38:16.964
Oh my God, look out!

38:17.031 --> 38:18.166
Jesus!

38:18.232 --> 38:20.168
Tuck, get on something, quick!

38:21.969 --> 38:23.805
Oh, it's the kids!

38:24.772 --> 38:26.040
Oh my God.

38:30.578 --> 38:31.979
Please be careful!

38:35.650 --> 38:36.951
What are we gonna do?

38:43.390 --> 38:45.660
Charlotte!

38:45.726 --> 38:48.029
Tucker, are you guys okay?

38:50.264 --> 38:52.633
Mom, it's... it's the shark.

39:00.373 --> 39:01.909
I think it killed Mr. Rowan.

39:10.318 --> 39:11.919
Dad!

39:16.456 --> 39:17.692
Lacey, are you okay?

39:17.758 --> 39:19.627
What's going on down there?

39:19.694 --> 39:22.029
It's gonna be okay, Tucker.
It's going to be okay.

39:24.665 --> 39:26.067
Charlotte, are you okay, baby?

39:34.008 --> 39:36.777
It's the shark!
It's the shark!

39:39.013 --> 39:40.581
Oh...

39:50.324 --> 39:52.526
Dad, it's the shark...

39:53.794 --> 39:56.063
We're going to get
your out of here, guys.

39:57.331 --> 39:58.966
Dad...

39:59.800 --> 40:01.736
Dad? I want you to go upstairs.

40:01.802 --> 40:05.606
I want you to get the fish
on the kitchen counter

40:05.673 --> 40:08.441
and I want you to get
your fishing rods.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.179
Okay, okay,
that's good.

40:33.868 --> 40:36.404
Sorry. The road's closed
until further notice.

40:36.469 --> 40:37.972
Are you serious?

40:38.039 --> 40:40.374
Lots of flooding down by
the beach and on the roads.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.809
I gotta get to my family!

40:41.876 --> 40:43.377
They're in a rental down
there on the beach!

40:43.443 --> 40:44.879
I doubt it.

40:44.946 --> 40:47.615
Houses on the beach,
they're all evacuating.

40:47.682 --> 40:49.449
My family's down there, officer.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.621
Then they're probably at
the Red Cross Evac Center.

40:53.688 --> 40:54.922
They didn't say anything to me

40:54.989 --> 40:56.223
about evacuating
when I talked to them.

40:56.290 --> 40:58.159
I don't know what to tell you.

40:58.225 --> 41:00.027
Are you sure I can't go down
and make sure they're not there?

41:00.094 --> 41:04.298
You need to turn around.
Nobody's getting through.

41:04.365 --> 41:05.833
Where's the Evac Center?

41:05.900 --> 41:09.103
At Clarion Elementary
about four miles south.

41:09.170 --> 41:10.338
You know where that is?

41:10.404 --> 41:11.939
I'll find it.

41:21.983 --> 41:24.218
Hang in there,
we're going to get you out.

41:24.285 --> 41:25.753
Okay.

41:28.589 --> 41:31.625
Dad? You okay?

41:32.593 --> 41:35.529
Coming,
almost there.

41:41.369 --> 41:42.937
Dad!

41:43.004 --> 41:47.441
Charlotte, you can use that.
Yes, you can do it.

41:47.508 --> 41:49.176
You can do it.

41:49.243 --> 41:50.778
Mom?

41:57.718 --> 41:59.086
What's it doing?

41:59.153 --> 42:01.055
I just want to get
the hell out of here.

42:04.492 --> 42:08.696
Grandpa's coming.
He's coming, okay?

42:10.664 --> 42:11.632
Okay.

42:11.699 --> 42:13.334
I've got the pole.

42:13.401 --> 42:15.870
I hope this works.

42:21.308 --> 42:24.912
What's that supposed to do?

42:24.979 --> 42:26.080
Grandpa?

42:26.147 --> 42:28.416
Okay, okay.

42:28.482 --> 42:29.784
Gimme a second.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.328
Make your way, okay?

42:41.395 --> 42:43.864
Just stay right there for now.

42:58.145 --> 43:00.147
It's caught!
You did it!

43:02.349 --> 43:04.685
Now! Now!

43:04.752 --> 43:08.622
Now, Charlotte!
You have to move now!

43:08.689 --> 43:13.060
-Charlotte, now!
-Wait for it to pass!

43:13.127 --> 43:14.195
You've got to go!

43:17.765 --> 43:20.034
Charlotte, come on!

43:33.314 --> 43:34.516
You can do it!

43:34.583 --> 43:36.884
Come on, you can do it!

43:39.286 --> 43:40.955
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

43:47.728 --> 43:50.631
Come on, give me your hand.

44:03.344 --> 44:05.946
-Come on, Tucker. Come on.
-You can do this.

44:08.082 --> 44:10.751
Okay, you're set to go.

44:11.785 --> 44:13.522
-God, baby, come on.
-Come on, Champ.

44:13.588 --> 44:15.489
-Come on.
-You can do this.

44:15.557 --> 44:17.158
Fastest swimmer in the school.

44:17.224 --> 44:20.694
Remember that meet
with the prep school?

44:20.761 --> 44:23.864
They won state three years
in a row?

44:26.100 --> 44:28.836
Tucker, look at me.
Look at me!

44:28.903 --> 44:31.071
Oh, gosh, kicked their ass

44:31.138 --> 44:33.707
by a full seven
points, didn't you?

44:34.775 --> 44:35.976
That's right.

44:36.043 --> 44:37.077
Now?

44:39.146 --> 44:40.414
Go!

44:42.716 --> 44:44.185
No!

44:48.489 --> 44:50.824
All right... let go, let go.

44:55.296 --> 44:56.764
You okay?

44:58.832 --> 45:00.768
Yes...

45:12.213 --> 45:13.714
Come on.

45:13.781 --> 45:15.282
You trust me?

45:19.320 --> 45:23.090
-Go, now! Now!
-Go, go, go! Come on!

45:23.157 --> 45:25.826
Come here! Tucker!
Come on!

45:53.320 --> 45:54.855
I thought I'd lose
both of you!

45:54.922 --> 45:57.925
-Thank God you're okay!
-Are you okay?

45:57.992 --> 45:59.994
-Yeah, I'm okay, Grandpa.
-You okay?

46:00.060 --> 46:02.229
-Okay.
-Okay.

46:02.296 --> 46:03.764
You okay?
Let me take a look at you.

46:05.165 --> 46:08.369
You sure kept that
shark busy down there.

46:08.435 --> 46:11.506
-Was that Mr. Rowan?
-Don't think about that!

46:11.573 --> 46:13.774
You're cold.
He's cold.

46:13.841 --> 46:16.810
Go get your brother
a blanket, a towel.

46:16.877 --> 46:19.446
And, Charlotte, could you
bring me back my oxygen?

47:21.975 --> 47:25.412
The phone connections
are still busy.

47:25.479 --> 47:28.882
We need to get
Becky to a hospital!

47:28.949 --> 47:30.484
And these kids
out of the house

47:30.552 --> 47:34.589
before the water rises and
the shark attacks again!

47:34.656 --> 47:35.690
You go.

47:35.757 --> 47:37.358
I'll stay behind.

47:37.424 --> 47:40.427
No! The tide's rising!
We're not leaving you here!

47:40.494 --> 47:42.296
You can and I will!

47:42.363 --> 47:44.198
We're not leaving you, grandpa!

47:44.264 --> 47:45.966
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

47:50.538 --> 47:53.173
-That's the shark!
-The stairs must be flooded.

47:54.108 --> 47:56.410
Help me! Help me!

47:56.477 --> 47:57.911
Grab that, please!

47:57.978 --> 47:59.581
Bring it over here!

48:07.321 --> 48:08.889
Thank you!

48:10.825 --> 48:12.627
Yes, yes, yes.

48:18.499 --> 48:19.933
Grab the other one! Yes!

48:27.441 --> 48:29.511
-Come on!
-Careful, careful.

48:39.788 --> 48:41.790
Oh!

48:41.856 --> 48:43.792
Rope, rope, we need rope!

48:43.858 --> 48:46.561
Come on! Yes!

48:50.230 --> 48:52.166
Thank you.
My strong baby!

49:03.711 --> 49:05.946
Oh my God, what happened?

49:13.888 --> 49:14.823
Becky?

49:14.889 --> 49:17.257
It's gone... for now.

49:20.728 --> 49:22.864
You okay?

49:22.931 --> 49:23.997
I'm better.

49:24.064 --> 49:26.333
I'm still a little bit nauseous.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.368
Okay.

49:28.435 --> 49:31.271
Stay warm,
honey, stay warm.

49:33.575 --> 49:35.075
You're wet.

49:35.142 --> 49:37.344
We'll find a way to get
you out of here, okay?

49:37.411 --> 49:40.047
Your family's
been so nice to me.

49:41.716 --> 49:43.083
Are the phones working?

49:43.150 --> 49:45.285
I should call my dad
and tell him where I am.

49:51.626 --> 49:52.660
They're still down.

49:53.795 --> 49:54.929
Keep trying, please?

49:54.995 --> 49:56.997
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I will.

49:57.932 --> 49:59.567
What are you doing?

50:01.268 --> 50:02.904
Are you all right?

50:02.971 --> 50:06.006
Hudson, what are you doing here?

50:06.073 --> 50:07.174
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

50:07.241 --> 50:08.543
What happened to your head?

50:08.610 --> 50:10.512
I was looking for Becky.

50:10.578 --> 50:13.615
Something flew by
and hit me in the head.

50:13.681 --> 50:14.782
This wind!

50:16.651 --> 50:18.620
If you're looking for Becky,
I'm looking for my family!

50:18.686 --> 50:20.187
Why don't we look
together, okay?

50:20.254 --> 50:21.355
I was just there.

50:21.421 --> 50:23.758
A telephone pole
crushed your SUV,

50:23.825 --> 50:26.326
but I didn't see anyone.

50:26.393 --> 50:28.128
Come on.

50:28.195 --> 50:29.263
Where's your car?

50:29.329 --> 50:31.031
Up the hill. Yours?

50:31.098 --> 50:32.099
I got it stuck in the mud
when I went

50:32.165 --> 50:33.601
around the police barricade.

50:33.668 --> 50:34.769
Nice.

50:34.836 --> 50:36.738
You think Becky might
be with Tucker?

50:36.804 --> 50:38.573
I think so, yeah.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.374
-I'm not ready for this shit.
-Me either, man.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.276
-You all right?
-Yeah.

50:42.342 --> 50:44.444
All right. Come on.

50:44.512 --> 50:47.314
It's still not
getting anything.

50:47.381 --> 50:49.684
You guys, where is
that radio that one time

50:49.751 --> 50:51.084
we had at the beach?

50:51.151 --> 50:52.486
We brought it down
there last summer.

50:52.554 --> 50:54.154
I think it's in the other room.

50:54.221 --> 50:56.290
It's in the drawer!
It's in the drawer!

50:56.356 --> 50:57.525
In the drawer,
in the drawers, look.

50:57.592 --> 50:59.426
On the right side, right there.

51:02.630 --> 51:04.131
Keep looking,
don't get distracted!

51:04.197 --> 51:05.900
I'm looking!

51:05.967 --> 51:08.970
Hurry! It sounds like
the door is breaking!

51:09.037 --> 51:11.739
Found it!

51:11.806 --> 51:13.140
Give it to me!

51:13.206 --> 51:14.207
Come on!
Bring it over here!

51:14.274 --> 51:15.944
Please, please, God.

51:16.010 --> 51:17.712
Please, please.

51:19.413 --> 51:21.015
How do you get...
It's not working.

51:21.081 --> 51:23.483
Mom!
There's more water coming in!

51:23.551 --> 51:25.053
Here, let me see it,
let me see it.

51:25.118 --> 51:26.286
If we can just get up
over the hill,

51:26.353 --> 51:29.557
we will get out of
this flood zone.

51:29.624 --> 51:31.793
I can go!
I'll get help and come back!

51:31.859 --> 51:33.226
No, no.
I'm gonna go.

51:33.293 --> 51:34.696
I will see if there's
anyone next door.

51:34.762 --> 51:36.030
And then we
can borrow their car.

51:36.096 --> 51:37.364
I'll go!

51:37.431 --> 51:39.232
No, no! Stay here.

51:39.299 --> 51:41.134
Please take care of
grandpa and Becky!

51:41.201 --> 51:43.370
I'll be right back!

52:08.663 --> 52:10.163

52:24.912 --> 52:26.313
Mom?

52:26.380 --> 52:30.785
-Well?
-Did you find anyone?

52:30.852 --> 52:32.086
No, and this storm...

52:32.152 --> 52:33.487
Well, what about Dad?

52:33.554 --> 52:35.155
He's gonna have a hard time
getting up here.

52:35.222 --> 52:38.660
They probably closed off
this entire area.

52:38.726 --> 52:41.829
So we're just gonna
sit here and die? No!

52:41.896 --> 52:44.565
Guys, I gotta talk to your mom.

52:50.104 --> 52:51.405
Listen...

52:54.008 --> 52:55.910
I'm not...

52:55.977 --> 52:59.847
I'm not running up those
damn stairs to the car.

52:59.914 --> 53:01.115
You know that.

53:01.181 --> 53:03.183
What?

53:03.250 --> 53:06.521
When you get to
safety, just ...

53:06.587 --> 53:08.388
send someone back for me.

53:10.323 --> 53:12.459
I'm not leaving you.

53:14.996 --> 53:16.296
No.

53:16.363 --> 53:21.201
You need to protect
my grandkids.

53:21.268 --> 53:26.140
And the only way
you're going to do that

53:26.206 --> 53:27.642
is to get out of here.

53:31.079 --> 53:32.513
Okay.

53:42.090 --> 53:47.128
Charlotte, she's going to
make one hell of a doctor.

53:47.195 --> 53:49.396
Such a big heart.

53:49.463 --> 53:55.235
And Tucker, he's going
to set the world on fire.

54:02.777 --> 54:03.845
Go on.

54:06.047 --> 54:07.515
Go on.

54:07.582 --> 54:10.818
Go on. Go on.
Get outta here.

54:17.125 --> 54:20.027
I love you.

54:20.094 --> 54:21.328
I love you, too.

54:22.096 --> 54:23.898
Now, go. Go on!

54:25.499 --> 54:28.703
Guys, come on.
Get your things.

54:28.770 --> 54:29.570
Grab Becky.

54:29.637 --> 54:33.074
-We're going?
-Yes!

54:33.141 --> 54:34.742
Is grandpa coming with us?

54:34.809 --> 54:36.443
No! Honey, no.

54:38.646 --> 54:40.280
I love you, grandpa.

54:40.347 --> 54:41.949
I love you, too.

54:44.152 --> 54:45.620
I'm proud of you both.

54:45.686 --> 54:48.689
You listen to your mom.
I'll see you in a bit.

54:48.756 --> 54:50.357
-Okay, go on now. Go.
-Guys, come on.

54:50.423 --> 54:52.593
We gotta get Becky.

55:04.205 --> 55:06.174
The door!

55:06.240 --> 55:07.575
Charlotte, help me!

55:17.652 --> 55:19.654
Get off the ground!

55:19.720 --> 55:22.757
Mom!

55:26.594 --> 55:30.932
Dad! Get out of the water!

55:34.434 --> 55:36.871
Mom! Are you okay?

55:48.015 --> 55:49.416
You okay?

56:14.407 --> 56:16.409
Don't move, Tucker!

56:24.218 --> 56:27.021
Guys, we need to go upstairs.

56:29.123 --> 56:30.091
How?

56:30.157 --> 56:31.792
Grab what you can.

56:32.827 --> 56:34.061
Got it!

56:36.496 --> 56:38.366
Dad, you with me?

56:38.431 --> 56:39.667
Dad?

56:39.734 --> 56:41.869
-Yeah.
-You okay?

56:41.936 --> 56:44.839
-How's Becky. Becky?
-I'm fine.

56:48.276 --> 56:50.344
What are you doing?

56:50.410 --> 56:52.246
I'm gonna distract the shark

56:52.313 --> 56:54.081
and you're gonna
run up the stairs.

56:54.148 --> 56:55.516
No, Charlotte!

56:55.583 --> 56:57.785
Get on the stairs!

57:00.688 --> 57:02.823
Charlotte, stay on the stairs!

57:06.527 --> 57:08.863
Charlotte...

57:08.930 --> 57:10.698
Charlotte, give me the umbrella!

57:20.975 --> 57:22.076
Behind you!

57:23.443 --> 57:26.213
Mom! Go, go!

57:26.280 --> 57:27.949
Behind you!

57:32.687 --> 57:34.588
It's over here!

57:34.655 --> 57:35.756
Tucker, get it!

57:35.823 --> 57:37.792
Mom, get to the stairs!

57:47.735 --> 57:49.704
Grandpa, you good?

57:50.470 --> 57:52.206
-Okay. You okay?
-Yeah.

57:53.074 --> 57:54.141
You okay?

57:54.208 --> 57:56.310
I think it went
in the other room.

57:56.377 --> 57:57.878
Okay, okay.

58:02.316 --> 58:05.052
Take Becky up.

58:06.821 --> 58:09.423
Grandpa, you're gonna die!
Get on the table! Please!

58:09.489 --> 58:11.225
You take Becky up the stairs.

58:11.292 --> 58:13.094
I'll distract this fucker!

58:32.380 --> 58:34.081
Come on, I got ya.

58:39.787 --> 58:42.757
All right, Dad,
come up the stairs.

58:48.396 --> 58:49.830
Dad!

58:55.036 --> 58:57.171
Let it go!
Come up the stairs!

59:02.643 --> 59:04.145
Grandpa!
Get up now!

59:09.150 --> 59:11.218
No!

59:11.285 --> 59:13.220
Ah!

59:13.287 --> 59:15.289
No, no!
Ah!

59:15.356 --> 59:17.158
-Ah!
-No!

59:20.161 --> 59:21.262
No, no!

59:29.603 --> 59:31.639
Dad!

59:41.882 --> 59:44.618
Go upstairs, kids.

59:44.685 --> 59:46.720
I'm gonna fuck up a shark!

59:49.490 --> 59:53.828
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

59:55.062 --> 59:56.997
Mom! Stop!

59:57.064 --> 59:59.066
Mom! Please!
Come up here now!

1:00:05.339 --> 1:00:07.775
Why is there a shark
in the house?

1:00:21.255 --> 1:00:22.923
Look, be careful.

1:00:24.559 --> 1:00:26.093
Oh, my God.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.395
They can't be in there,
can they?

1:00:30.698 --> 1:00:32.333
I don't know, come on.

1:00:32.399 --> 1:00:33.901
-Let's go.
-Watch out.

1:00:46.981 --> 1:00:50.050
How you doing, Beck?

1:00:51.752 --> 1:00:53.420
I'm so sorry about
everything, Mrs. Samson.

1:00:53.487 --> 1:00:56.757
No, it's not your fault.
You understand, right?

1:00:56.824 --> 1:00:58.325
It's okay.

1:00:58.392 --> 1:00:59.793
It won't work!

1:00:59.860 --> 1:01:02.396
Charlotte, just try again.
Just try again.

1:01:02.463 --> 1:01:05.199
Hey, what about the Smart watch?
Did you bring it.

1:01:05.266 --> 1:01:07.067
Yeah!
Totally forgot about it.

1:01:08.435 --> 1:01:11.438
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:01:18.112 --> 1:01:19.747
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

1:01:22.383 --> 1:01:24.519
Hello?
Can you hear me?

1:01:24.586 --> 1:01:26.020
We need help!

1:01:26.086 --> 1:01:28.422
Our house is flooded and we...

1:01:28.489 --> 1:01:30.758
<i>Of course, ma'am.</i>
<i>We can send someone right over.</i>

1:01:30.824 --> 1:01:32.893
<i>What's your name and</i>
<i>address, please?</i>

1:01:34.261 --> 1:01:37.666
Tell her, Mom!

1:01:37.731 --> 1:01:39.568
This is Lacey Samson!

1:01:39.634 --> 1:01:41.035
I...

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:47.374
I lost them.
I lost them.

1:01:47.441 --> 1:01:50.612
Try again!
Try again!

1:01:50.679 --> 1:01:51.879
Damn it!

1:01:51.946 --> 1:01:53.180
We were on the
phone long enough!

1:01:53.247 --> 1:01:54.481
They can ping
our location, right?

1:01:54.549 --> 1:01:55.849
Definitely.

1:01:55.916 --> 1:01:57.251
I don't know how that works,
I mean,

1:01:57.318 --> 1:01:58.986
especially with how
bad the weather is.

1:02:01.322 --> 1:02:02.389
Shoot.

1:02:04.593 --> 1:02:05.993
Mom, we have to get to the roof!

1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:07.562
If there's a rescue
vehicle at this point,

1:02:07.629 --> 1:02:10.998
it's by boat or helicopter!
We can wave them down!

1:02:11.065 --> 1:02:13.334
Are you nuts?
We're safer in here!

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:17.137
Guys, guys.

1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:35.022
Get on the bed! Now!

1:02:35.089 --> 1:02:36.490
Oh my God, I see 'em!

1:02:36.558 --> 1:02:38.492
I see 'em!
I see 'em!

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.296
-Hey, hey, guys!
-Becky!

1:02:42.363 --> 1:02:44.532
We're going to get to you...
some how.

1:02:46.867 --> 1:02:49.336
-The shark!
-Stay on the bed!

1:02:49.403 --> 1:02:50.904
Feet up!

1:02:52.741 --> 1:02:55.209
We've got to open that window.

1:02:59.213 --> 1:03:01.683
Push the bed to the window!

1:03:01.750 --> 1:03:03.484
Charlotte, can you do it?

1:03:30.645 --> 1:03:32.946
Quick! Shut the window!

1:03:33.013 --> 1:03:35.916
Charlotte! Tucker!

1:03:35.983 --> 1:03:37.619
Look, it's Dad!

1:03:40.988 --> 1:03:43.891
-Hey!
-Honey!

1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:49.296
Lacey! Tucker! Charlotte!

1:03:49.363 --> 1:03:51.599
Dad! Dad!

1:03:53.735 --> 1:03:58.238
Is that Dad?
Dad!

1:03:58.305 --> 1:03:59.239
Hey!

1:03:59.306 --> 1:04:01.576
Dad!

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.555
Is Becky in there?

1:04:14.689 --> 1:04:16.524
Becky is hurt!

1:04:16.591 --> 1:04:18.760
Dad, I was bit by a shark!

1:04:18.827 --> 1:04:20.427
She's here!

1:04:20.494 --> 1:04:22.363
A shark bit her!

1:04:32.139 --> 1:04:34.375
Guys, is that the shark?

1:04:36.443 --> 1:04:38.212
Hudson! Shark!

1:04:43.350 --> 1:04:45.085
Hold on!
What do we do?

1:04:45.152 --> 1:04:46.588
Listen to me...

1:04:46.654 --> 1:04:50.692
Strap your legs
underneath the board, okay?

1:04:50.759 --> 1:04:52.926
If we wait a minute
maybe it'll pass, okay?

1:04:52.993 --> 1:04:54.763
Pass? Pass where?

1:04:54.829 --> 1:04:56.564
Go away?
Where's it gonna go?

1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:01.335
Oh, shit.

1:05:01.402 --> 1:05:02.570
Dad!

1:05:04.506 --> 1:05:06.608
We drifted away from the house,
we have to paddle.

1:05:06.674 --> 1:05:07.975
Don't move!

1:05:08.041 --> 1:05:10.344
-I have to get to Becky!
-Don't move, man!

1:05:13.046 --> 1:05:15.850
Hey, look, the current is going
to kill us or that shark is,

1:05:15.916 --> 1:05:19.953
and I'm not going to come this
far and not get my daughter.

1:05:20.855 --> 1:05:22.791
Ok, guys!

1:05:22.857 --> 1:05:25.894
Do we have a rope in here?
We need to bring Dad in!

1:05:25.959 --> 1:05:28.462
Or maybe I'll
tie these sheets...

1:05:28.530 --> 1:05:30.197
They can't use their
arms of legs.

1:05:30.264 --> 1:05:32.667
It will draw the shark
to them.

1:05:32.734 --> 1:05:35.502
Do you... do you hear that?

1:05:35.570 --> 1:05:36.638
Look, it's a boat!

1:05:41.876 --> 1:05:44.445
It's a rescue boat.

1:05:48.716 --> 1:05:50.117
I don't think they can see us.

1:05:51.318 --> 1:05:53.187
We need to find a flashlight
or something

1:05:53.253 --> 1:05:55.322
that will get their attention.

1:05:55.389 --> 1:05:59.126
You guys see what you can find.
I'll work on the sheets.

1:06:00.795 --> 1:06:02.329
What about the closet?

1:06:02.396 --> 1:06:04.599
There's a ladder in there
that goes up to the attic.

1:06:08.101 --> 1:06:10.170
You think there's
something in there?

1:06:10.237 --> 1:06:11.639
We'll find out.

1:06:13.073 --> 1:06:14.509
Careful!

1:06:19.012 --> 1:06:20.715
What the heck are
we waiting on?

1:06:23.383 --> 1:06:24.886
They're working on something
to pull us in.

1:06:24.953 --> 1:06:26.453
Just hang tight.

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:48.576
Nothing yet!

1:06:52.379 --> 1:06:54.983
Hey I got some flashlights!

1:06:55.048 --> 1:06:56.416
Okay, bring 'em down!

1:07:02.557 --> 1:07:06.426
We need to get your Dad
and Tad out of there!

1:07:06.493 --> 1:07:07.962
Come on!

1:07:08.028 --> 1:07:09.797
Okay! Okay!

1:07:16.838 --> 1:07:19.139
We're gonna pull you in!

1:07:19.206 --> 1:07:21.375
Grab the sheets!

1:07:21.441 --> 1:07:23.277
Wait a minute!
Hold on!

1:07:24.646 --> 1:07:27.047
The shark is under you,
stay still, okay?

1:07:27.114 --> 1:07:28.950
No!

1:07:29.017 --> 1:07:30.585
Throw it out!

1:07:30.652 --> 1:07:32.754
I'm gonna pull you in!
Grab on to this!

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:39.126
Dad, come on!
Dad!

1:07:39.192 --> 1:07:41.529
Grab on, guys!
Help me!

1:07:41.596 --> 1:07:43.698
Pull! Now!

1:07:43.765 --> 1:07:45.465
Ah!

1:07:45.533 --> 1:07:46.768
No!

1:07:51.906 --> 1:07:53.541
No!

1:07:57.612 --> 1:07:58.345
Tad!

1:07:58.412 --> 1:08:00.447
Give me your hand, man.

1:08:00.515 --> 1:08:03.450
Tad, give me
your hand, man.

1:08:03.518 --> 1:08:04.819
No!

1:08:08.656 --> 1:08:12.627
Tad! Tad!

1:08:17.599 --> 1:08:18.700
Grab on to this.

1:08:18.766 --> 1:08:20.367
Please, grab it now.

1:08:21.769 --> 1:08:23.437
Pull it in!

1:08:25.006 --> 1:08:26.741
Come on.

1:08:26.808 --> 1:08:29.677
Pull! Pull!

1:08:31.111 --> 1:08:34.749
-Dad!
-Close the window!

1:08:34.816 --> 1:08:37.451
Honey, Oh my God!

1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:40.922
I'm so sorry.

1:08:40.989 --> 1:08:43.123
I'm so, so, so sorry!
Becky, he came to save you!

1:08:43.190 --> 1:08:44.592
-It's my fault.
- Just know that!

1:08:44.659 --> 1:08:46.193
It is not your fault!
It is not your fault!

1:08:46.259 --> 1:08:49.329
No, it's not!
He came to save you, okay?

1:08:49.396 --> 1:08:50.865
And he wanted to keep you
safe and now we're gonna

1:08:50.932 --> 1:08:53.467
keep you safe, I promise
you that, all right?

1:08:55.837 --> 1:08:59.707
-Water's rising again!
-We have to get to the roof!

1:08:59.774 --> 1:09:01.009
Out the window.

1:09:01.075 --> 1:09:02.877
-Where the shark is?
-Where the rescue boat is.

1:09:02.944 --> 1:09:04.712
So we can get their attention.

1:09:04.779 --> 1:09:06.614
We can't stay here.
The water's rising.

1:09:06.681 --> 1:09:08.415
We can't use the surf boards
because of the shark!

1:09:08.482 --> 1:09:11.218
We gotta go, okay?

1:09:11.284 --> 1:09:12.520
Becky, do you think
you can make it?

1:09:12.587 --> 1:09:14.756
Honey, you have to
try and leave.

1:09:14.822 --> 1:09:18.092
All right, come on.
Here we go.

1:09:18.158 --> 1:09:19.794
Come on.

1:09:19.861 --> 1:09:23.397
Okay, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute!

1:09:23.463 --> 1:09:25.198
Is that the attic?

1:09:25.265 --> 1:09:26.466
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:09:26.534 --> 1:09:27.769
You take the kids
up to the roof.

1:09:27.835 --> 1:09:29.403
I'm gonna take Becky
to the attic!

1:09:29.469 --> 1:09:30.972
No, that's crazy!
The water is rising!

1:09:31.039 --> 1:09:32.640
No, no, no, listen to me!

1:09:32.707 --> 1:09:37.277
If she bleeds in the water, it
will draw the shark right to us.

1:09:37.344 --> 1:09:38.613
I gotta get her to the attic!

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:40.280
Then I'll break through
to the roof.

1:09:40.347 --> 1:09:41.616
I will get through it,
I promise you that!

1:09:41.683 --> 1:09:43.551
I'll take her to the attic!
I got it!

1:09:43.618 --> 1:09:45.318
Son, I need you on the roof.

1:09:45.385 --> 1:09:47.755
Let me take her to
the attic, okay?

1:09:47.822 --> 1:09:49.289
I need you on the roof
to help me

1:09:49.356 --> 1:09:51.092
break through from
the other side.

1:09:51.159 --> 1:09:54.261
No, no...

1:09:54.327 --> 1:09:56.898
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

1:09:56.964 --> 1:10:00.034
-You sure about this?
-I'm sure about this, okay?

1:10:00.101 --> 1:10:02.937
-I got you, all right?
-Yeah.

1:10:03.004 --> 1:10:04.038
All right, come on.

1:10:04.105 --> 1:10:05.606
What are you doing?

1:10:05.673 --> 1:10:06.874
You're gonna need help
bringing her up, okay?

1:10:06.941 --> 1:10:07.942
And then I'm gonna leave.

1:10:08.009 --> 1:10:09.409
Kids, use the flashlights.

1:10:09.476 --> 1:10:11.311
See if the rescue boat
is still out there, okay?

1:10:11.378 --> 1:10:13.014
You're okay, you're okay.

1:10:13.081 --> 1:10:14.615
Listen to me.

1:10:14.682 --> 1:10:15.950
When your mom gets to the
window, you help her up, okay?

1:10:16.017 --> 1:10:17.518
Promise?

1:10:17.585 --> 1:10:20.588
Be careful! And watch out for
the fucking shark.

1:10:21.989 --> 1:10:23.290
Come on. Come on.

1:10:23.356 --> 1:10:25.492
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
We got her!

1:10:34.669 --> 1:10:36.671
Okay, hold on, hold on!

1:10:42.610 --> 1:10:43.343
You okay?

1:10:43.410 --> 1:10:45.146
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1:10:45.213 --> 1:10:47.648
Okay, come here, get up here!

1:10:47.715 --> 1:10:49.784
-Becky!
-I got you.

1:10:49.851 --> 1:10:51.384
All right, listen!
She's up here now!

1:10:51.451 --> 1:10:53.453
Go on up to the roof, okay?

1:10:53.521 --> 1:10:55.690
Okay, I'm going to the roof.

1:10:59.392 --> 1:11:01.929
Hudson!
The shark!

1:11:03.064 --> 1:11:05.166
Babe, I said the roof!

1:11:05.233 --> 1:11:08.401
The shark!
Hudson, it's down there!

1:11:09.971 --> 1:11:12.472
Hey! Help, shark!

1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:14.575
Did you hear that?

1:11:14.642 --> 1:11:15.710
-We need help!
-Shark!

1:11:15.777 --> 1:11:17.612
Flash the light over there!

1:11:23.416 --> 1:11:25.953
They're gone!

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:27.255
You see that?

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.390
I thought I heard
people screaming.

1:11:30.457 --> 1:11:32.425
All the condos, they're gone!

1:11:33.261 --> 1:11:34.729
You think there's anyone--

1:11:37.598 --> 1:11:39.499
That was way too close!

1:11:39.567 --> 1:11:40.601
Do you wanna head back?

1:11:40.668 --> 1:11:43.070
No! We can go for five!

1:11:43.137 --> 1:11:44.471
That's it!

1:11:44.539 --> 1:11:46.339
The call said they
were by the beach,

1:11:46.406 --> 1:11:49.577
but there's no beach left!

1:11:49.644 --> 1:11:51.679
Let's give it the extra mile!
Keep searching!

1:11:51.746 --> 1:11:54.248
If we don't find them,
then we'll head back!

1:11:54.314 --> 1:11:55.817
Copy!

1:12:08.229 --> 1:12:11.098
Grab the flashlight and
look out for the shark!

1:12:11.165 --> 1:12:13.333
They're still out there!

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:14.535
But it looks like
they're leaving!

1:12:14.602 --> 1:12:16.871
Hey, over here!

1:12:18.471 --> 1:12:21.242
-Over here, hey!
-We're on the roof!

1:12:21.309 --> 1:12:23.578
We need to go back!

1:12:23.644 --> 1:12:26.346
Wait! Look to starboard side!

1:12:26.413 --> 1:12:28.182
What is that?

1:12:28.249 --> 1:12:29.650
I think we found them!

1:12:29.717 --> 1:12:31.285
We have to get them!

1:12:31.351 --> 1:12:34.155
We're on the roof!

1:12:34.222 --> 1:12:35.823
We're here!

1:12:35.890 --> 1:12:37.091
They see us!

1:12:38.491 --> 1:12:39.927
They're coming, hurry!

1:12:39.994 --> 1:12:42.630
Dad, can you hear us?
You need to get up here!

1:12:42.697 --> 1:12:45.099
We need to get up
to the roof.

1:12:45.166 --> 1:12:47.034
Okay.

1:12:47.101 --> 1:12:49.036
Over here!

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:01.315
I don't see their light anymore!

1:13:01.381 --> 1:13:03.751
I don't see them!

1:13:05.353 --> 1:13:07.688
Captain! Captain!

1:13:08.890 --> 1:13:10.791
Captain!

1:13:25.039 --> 1:13:27.275
What is that?

1:13:27.341 --> 1:13:30.144
Flares are
a distress signal!

1:13:30.211 --> 1:13:32.713
Why? Is that for us?

1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:34.414
I don't see their light anymore!

1:13:34.481 --> 1:13:36.684
They probably flipped.

1:13:36.751 --> 1:13:38.986
That means
they just turned it off!

1:13:39.053 --> 1:13:41.122
Maybe they're dead!

1:13:41.188 --> 1:13:44.091
Or in trouble with
the shark, I don't know!

1:13:44.158 --> 1:13:46.060
You don't know that!

1:13:46.127 --> 1:13:47.561
They're not coming!

1:13:51.265 --> 1:13:53.234
What?

1:13:53.301 --> 1:13:54.869
The roof is moving!

1:13:54.936 --> 1:13:57.939
No, it's banging.
Mom and Dad!

1:14:06.614 --> 1:14:10.351
I have to find something else.

1:14:10.418 --> 1:14:13.486
Start stomping on it.

1:14:17.725 --> 1:14:21.195
Do you think Tucker's
going to be okay?

1:14:21.262 --> 1:14:24.832
Tucker, he's getting help.
He's getting help.

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.542
Find anything?

1:14:37.812 --> 1:14:40.081
Is that something?
Here, here.

1:14:42.350 --> 1:14:43.985
Got it!

1:14:45.019 --> 1:14:46.654
Honey!

1:14:46.721 --> 1:14:49.023
Okay, perfect.

1:14:49.090 --> 1:14:52.426
Here we go.

1:14:52.526 --> 1:14:56.764
-Come on, you son of a bitch,
Come on!

1:14:56.831 --> 1:14:59.133
We need to help Mom and Dad!
Keep stomping!

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:00.801
I am!

1:15:01.769 --> 1:15:03.337
What is this roof made of?

1:15:03.404 --> 1:15:05.840
It's supposed to be this tough.
It's on the beach!

1:15:05.906 --> 1:15:08.042
Everything in this stupid house
falls apart,

1:15:08.109 --> 1:15:10.945
but of course the roof
has to stay perfectly intact.

1:15:13.381 --> 1:15:14.648
There it is.

1:15:16.083 --> 1:15:17.051
Do you see it?

1:15:17.118 --> 1:15:18.819
Think so.

1:15:18.886 --> 1:15:20.821
Is it near the roof?

1:15:22.623 --> 1:15:24.558
Yeah, but it's just circling.

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:28.596
Well, not for long.

1:15:28.662 --> 1:15:30.264
Mom, Dad!

1:15:30.331 --> 1:15:32.500
Do you hear that?

1:15:32.566 --> 1:15:33.501
Honey, it's Tucker!

1:15:33.567 --> 1:15:34.902
The shark is here!

1:15:35.836 --> 1:15:37.071
Keep hitting the roof!

1:15:38.873 --> 1:15:41.242
Okay, listen, listen.

1:15:41.308 --> 1:15:43.344
If I can't get this roof open,

1:15:43.411 --> 1:15:44.345
we're gonna have to swim, okay?

1:15:44.412 --> 1:15:45.980
Why?

1:15:46.047 --> 1:15:47.615
Because if we stay up here,
honey, we're gonna drown.

1:15:47.681 --> 1:15:49.316
No, but the shark!

1:15:49.383 --> 1:15:52.119
We can't worry about
the shark right now, okay?

1:15:52.186 --> 1:15:55.189
If I can't get this roof open,
we're gonna have to swim for it.

1:15:58.492 --> 1:16:02.296
-You got it!
-Mom! Dad! Keep hitting!

1:16:02.363 --> 1:16:03.998
He did it!

1:16:04.065 --> 1:16:06.567
It's working, it's working!

1:16:06.634 --> 1:16:08.669
Go, Dad!

1:16:08.736 --> 1:16:10.137
Keep going!

1:16:11.672 --> 1:16:13.607
-Keep going!
-We can see you!

1:16:13.674 --> 1:16:16.143
Dad!

1:16:16.210 --> 1:16:17.745
You're almost through!

1:16:17.812 --> 1:16:19.680
Tucker? Charlotte?

1:16:21.782 --> 1:16:23.684
-Dad?
-I can hear you, son!

1:16:23.751 --> 1:16:27.154
Okay! Okay, guys!
We're getting out of here.

1:16:30.324 --> 1:16:32.226
I got you.
Careful, careful, careful!

1:16:33.194 --> 1:16:35.329
Help Becky!

1:16:35.396 --> 1:16:37.498
Take it easy.

1:16:37.566 --> 1:16:39.166
-Mom and Dad!
-Come on, Becky!

1:16:41.570 --> 1:16:43.070
Mom?

1:16:43.137 --> 1:16:45.540
Come on, honey.
All right, come on, honey.

1:16:45.606 --> 1:16:47.241
All right, come on.
There you go.

1:16:47.308 --> 1:16:50.311
There you go, baby, careful.
Careful, careful, careful.

1:16:56.585 --> 1:16:58.018
Okay, coming up!

1:16:59.653 --> 1:17:01.789
You got it?
Got it, Dad?

1:17:06.861 --> 1:17:08.195
Where's the rescue team?

1:17:08.262 --> 1:17:09.296
We don't know.

1:17:09.363 --> 1:17:10.498
They were here, now they're not!

1:17:10.565 --> 1:17:11.600
They sent up a flare!

1:17:11.665 --> 1:17:13.535
You mean like a distress signal?

1:17:13.602 --> 1:17:15.302
Was it the shark?

1:17:18.205 --> 1:17:20.975
Charlotte, don't go over there!
It might be live!

1:17:22.276 --> 1:17:24.044
-Wait!
-Hudson!

1:17:24.111 --> 1:17:25.646
You got to turn the power off.

1:17:25.713 --> 1:17:26.981
Hamilton showed me the breaker
box last year,

1:17:27.047 --> 1:17:28.883
it's up here on the roof!

1:17:28.949 --> 1:17:30.684
Dad, where are you going?

1:17:30.751 --> 1:17:32.920
It's off!
The power is off!

1:17:34.523 --> 1:17:36.323
The roof is collapsing.

1:17:36.390 --> 1:17:37.324
We need to find a way off.

1:17:38.893 --> 1:17:39.994
Guys, we need to get over
to the other roof!

1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:41.630
This one is going to collapse!

1:17:41.695 --> 1:17:42.897
We can try, but I don't think
we can make it over there.

1:17:42.963 --> 1:17:44.331
I don't think we have a choice!

1:17:44.398 --> 1:17:45.900
This roof isn't gonna
hold us any longer!

1:17:45.966 --> 1:17:47.268
We're just gonna have
the same problem.

1:17:47.334 --> 1:17:48.603
We need to get where
the cars are.

1:17:48.669 --> 1:17:50.404
Guys, guys, boat! Boat!

1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:53.908
I see it!

1:17:55.376 --> 1:17:57.077
Life jackets will be on there.

1:17:57.144 --> 1:17:58.379
And a radio!

1:17:58.445 --> 1:17:59.680
And flares!

1:17:59.747 --> 1:18:01.782
And something
to kill that shark!

1:18:01.849 --> 1:18:03.184
We gotta get to that boat!

1:18:03.250 --> 1:18:05.554
Okay, listen!
You guys stay here.

1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:06.720
I'm gonna go to the boat!

1:18:06.787 --> 1:18:07.788
What?

1:18:07.855 --> 1:18:09.658
Dad, dad? I'm going.

1:18:09.723 --> 1:18:11.225
No you're not.

1:18:14.461 --> 1:18:15.696
Let him go.

1:18:16.864 --> 1:18:19.733
I've swam this before,
I can do it again.

1:18:22.236 --> 1:18:23.437
Let him go.

1:18:29.511 --> 1:18:31.378
Let me go.

1:18:34.281 --> 1:18:35.517
Okay.

1:18:35.584 --> 1:18:38.152
I love you, son.
You can do it.

1:18:38.219 --> 1:18:40.921
Everybody get over here!
We gotta make some noise!

1:18:40.988 --> 1:18:43.290
And look out
for the shark!

1:18:47.962 --> 1:18:49.930
I don't see anything!

1:18:57.104 --> 1:19:00.407
I see it!
Over there!

1:19:00.474 --> 1:19:02.042
Tucker! The shark!

1:19:02.109 --> 1:19:04.912
Okay, move in! Move in!
Everybody, over here!

1:19:04.979 --> 1:19:07.515
Make some noise so
we can distract that shark!

1:19:23.163 --> 1:19:24.965
-Come on! Come on!
-Over here!

1:19:25.032 --> 1:19:27.835
-Come on, over here!
Come on!

1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:33.941
Hey!

1:19:47.722 --> 1:19:49.323
Okay.

1:20:00.467 --> 1:20:03.904
Hey! He made it!
He made it to the boat.

1:20:07.776 --> 1:20:11.145
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?

1:20:12.012 --> 1:20:13.314
Hello? Anyone?

1:20:16.317 --> 1:20:19.320
-Oh.
-The shark is coming over here.

1:20:19.386 --> 1:20:21.690
<i>This channel is for Emergency</i>
<i>services only.</i>

1:20:21.756 --> 1:20:23.290
I don't care!

1:20:23.357 --> 1:20:26.661
I'm in the ocean in front
of my family's condo.

1:20:26.728 --> 1:20:29.830
<i>Sir, identify yourself.</i>

1:20:29.897 --> 1:20:31.932
Okay, everybody, tighten up,
tighten up!

1:20:31.999 --> 1:20:33.635
My name is Tucker Samson.

1:20:33.702 --> 1:20:37.104
I'm 16 years old and I'm on
one of your rescue boats!

1:20:37.171 --> 1:20:39.741
<i>Where is the crew?</i>

1:20:39.808 --> 1:20:41.175
I don't know where the crew is!

1:20:41.241 --> 1:20:44.144
We saw them coming,
we saw the flares...

1:20:44.211 --> 1:20:45.312
Screw it!

1:20:50.851 --> 1:20:52.119
Okay, here he comes!

1:20:52.186 --> 1:20:54.288
I want you guys to
get in the boat!

1:20:58.793 --> 1:21:01.495
Come on, son.
Come on, son.

1:21:09.771 --> 1:21:11.773
Okay, just hold on.

1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:13.073
Stay here.

1:21:17.244 --> 1:21:20.782
I'll stop the shark!
Just get in the raft! Go!

1:21:20.849 --> 1:21:24.451
Come on! Everyone in the raft!
Come on!

1:21:24.519 --> 1:21:27.388
Come on, come on!

1:21:27.454 --> 1:21:28.656
-Tucker!
-Tuck!

1:21:30.124 --> 1:21:32.560
Dad!
Come on, Dad!

1:21:41.603 --> 1:21:45.339
Come on! Come on!

1:21:45.406 --> 1:21:46.940
I got you!

1:21:49.511 --> 1:21:50.978
Come on!

1:21:51.044 --> 1:21:52.714
Come right at me,
I'm right here! Get over here!

1:21:52.781 --> 1:21:54.214
Come on, hop up!

1:21:58.720 --> 1:21:59.987
Come on!

1:22:01.455 --> 1:22:02.557
Son of a bitch!

1:22:05.292 --> 1:22:06.493
Come on.

1:22:07.995 --> 1:22:09.930
Hudson, watch out!

1:22:12.933 --> 1:22:15.670
Take it! Take it!

1:22:23.812 --> 1:22:25.212
Take that.

1:22:29.383 --> 1:22:31.084
Fry, you piece of shit!

1:22:35.322 --> 1:22:37.090
Yes!

1:22:48.001 --> 1:22:50.137
Honey! Honey!

1:22:50.204 --> 1:22:52.841
Hudson! Hudson!

1:22:52.907 --> 1:22:54.642
Help me!

1:23:01.516 --> 1:23:03.050
Love you guys...

1:23:03.116 --> 1:23:05.185
I love you guys...
