02:33.947 --> 02:39.655
- All right, up you go, Max!
- Yeah! Up you go, Maxi-pad!

02:39.919 --> 02:42.424
Knock it off, Heidi.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.902
Oh, my God.

03:09.798 --> 03:13.152
Here we go, Max! Bring me that brick!

03:13.252 --> 03:15.791
Come on now!

03:17.539 --> 03:22.993
Maxi-pad! Maxi-pad! Maxi-pad!

03:54.643 --> 03:57.522
<i>You know what you have to do, Maxi.</i>

05:01.510 --> 05:05.469
Looks like someone wants a kiss!

05:16.458 --> 05:21.030
- Well?
- Well, what? He loves me.

05:21.130 --> 05:25.869
- He didn't give you detention?
- Detention? Please, girl.

05:25.969 --> 05:30.509
How he gon' give me detention when he
knows we gon' set this up on Friday!

05:31.875 --> 05:36.482
No, Valentine's... Valentine's is tonight.
Why would we go Friday?

05:38.981 --> 05:41.384
Well, I can't do Friday.

05:41.484 --> 05:44.645
Well, no, you know, the talent show.

05:44.987 --> 05:49.174
No, no, the talent show that
the kids organized for my operation.

05:50.426 --> 05:54.564
Did you really think
Mr. Rockwell was trying

05:54.664 --> 05:58.437
to kiss your little rat lips?

06:04.941 --> 06:07.944
Hey! I'm talking to you, Maxi-pad.

06:08.044 --> 06:11.047
No, no, I know, but, you know,
it's a nice gesture,

06:11.147 --> 06:13.665
you know how much these kids love me.

06:14.321 --> 06:17.854
Not like that.
No, they look up to me, Kim, all right.

06:17.954 --> 06:21.257
And I'd be a real jerk to ditch out on
my own fundraiser, don't you think?

06:21.357 --> 06:25.461
You really think he'd go for you?

06:25.561 --> 06:27.497
Over me?

06:27.597 --> 06:31.968
Just wait until he sees the twerking routine
we came up with for the talent show.

06:32.068 --> 06:34.437
Real Nicki Minaj shit.

06:34.537 --> 06:37.173
That's fine. No, no, no,
you know what, that's great.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.845
Yeah, I love you too.

06:55.725 --> 06:58.261
What are you doing to get him a new heart?

06:58.361 --> 07:00.430
Did you organize a talent show?

07:00.530 --> 07:03.390
Are you gonna perform something?

07:04.834 --> 07:09.005
I know. How about a little
game of show and tell?

07:09.105 --> 07:13.643
First you show everybody
your little friend, Mr. Box Cutter.

07:13.743 --> 07:17.713
And then just watch
as those donations pour in

07:17.813 --> 07:23.986
when you tell them it's the same toy
your dear, dead daddy

07:24.086 --> 07:26.525
killed himself with.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.471
I gotta meet Rick.

07:48.510 --> 07:52.951
- You're not going to go take a shower?
- No, I'll take one at home.

07:53.782 --> 07:58.390
I heard this one has rats in it.

10:58.650 --> 11:02.357
Stop following me, Maxi-pad.

11:04.472 --> 11:09.080
You're acting really weird today,
even for you.

11:10.745 --> 11:13.885
Well, go ahead.

11:21.023 --> 11:24.962
Well, I'm gonna cut through the woods.
See you tomorrow.

11:26.961 --> 11:29.568
Happy Valentine's day.

11:50.652 --> 11:53.158
What are you doing?

11:58.526 --> 12:01.433
You don't even live this way.

12:05.116 --> 12:07.889
Stop following me.

12:17.912 --> 12:20.485
Now look what you did!

12:51.613 --> 12:55.820
I... I was just kidding.

13:26.916 --> 13:30.186
- We're going to be late.
- Well, I thought I had until Friday.

13:30.286 --> 13:34.693
Why would you think that?
Valentine's day is tonight!

14:25.507 --> 14:28.144
<i>Shamrocks. Irish dancing.
Parades of green.</i>

14:28.244 --> 14:32.984
<i>These are some of the images that come to
mind when we think of St. Patrick's day.</i>

14:42.290 --> 14:44.660
<i>But who exactly was St. Patrick?</i>

14:44.760 --> 14:47.463
<i>And how did he deliver
the word of God to Ireland?</i>

14:47.563 --> 14:52.200
<i>A land once in the grip of druids,
pagans, and devil worshippers?</i>

14:52.300 --> 14:55.252
<i>According to legend, Patrick
banished all of the snakes from Ireland</i>

14:55.352 --> 14:57.402
<i>by tossing them into the sea.</i>

14:57.502 --> 15:01.544
<i>Although evidence suggests there were no
snakes in Ireland during the 5th century.</i>

15:01.644 --> 15:04.380
<i>Most scholars believe this
to be a metaphor.</i>

15:04.480 --> 15:08.050
<i>St. Patrick's expulsion
of the pagans and mystics.</i>

15:08.150 --> 15:12.902
<i>Long may Ireland let slip from memory
its paganistic days of old.</i>

15:19.293 --> 15:21.711
Hiya, Grainne.

15:22.830 --> 15:26.083
That's very pretty. Who is it for?

15:26.434 --> 15:28.652
Okay.

15:29.103 --> 15:32.325
Look. I know how hard change is,

15:32.425 --> 15:35.362
coming to a new school,
not having any friends.

15:35.611 --> 15:39.181
But I bet if you were to show us
that smile just for a second,

15:39.281 --> 15:43.166
it would make all the difference
in the world.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.222
Do you know what? I have an idea.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.508
Would you like to ring the lunch bell?

16:53.904 --> 16:57.943
<i>Hiya, it's me. I can't chat for long.
I'm here waiting for Sam.</i>

16:58.043 --> 17:02.357
<i>He's insisted I park away from the school
because apparently I'm not cool.</i>

17:05.124 --> 17:07.512
<i>He's like, "mum, it's not
authentic if I smile."</i>

17:07.612 --> 17:12.155
<i>Yeah, it's your holy communion photo,
not the dogme 95 movement.</i>

17:19.807 --> 17:22.631
<i>My doctor actually recommended
I get new contact lenses</i>

17:22.731 --> 17:25.220
<i>with "hope" printed on the insides.</i>

17:25.319 --> 17:27.823
<i>Apparently clinical trials
suggest it may help</i>

17:27.923 --> 17:31.059
<i>the cynical wheel
of self-loathing from turning.</i>

17:31.159 --> 17:33.877
<i>I hate myself.</i>

17:36.064 --> 17:38.734
<i>Anyway, I can't wait to see you
this weekend for paddy's day.</i>

17:38.834 --> 17:42.086
<i>We'll get fucked up, yeah? Find you a man?</i>

18:01.704 --> 18:04.398
<i>Liz, where are ya? I went back to
the bar but there was no sign of you</i>

18:04.498 --> 18:07.096
<i>and that Danny Zuko wannabe
you were talking to.</i>

18:07.196 --> 18:09.791
<i>Would you call me, you think?</i>

18:13.161 --> 18:16.171
I'd like you to pick your favorite book,

18:16.271 --> 18:19.809
write a page about why you like it,
and score the book out of ten.

18:19.909 --> 18:23.145
Hand in date is two weeks from today.

18:23.245 --> 18:27.464
Okay, everybody, page 38, circles.

18:50.221 --> 18:53.607
Fuck! Hiya, Grainne.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.627
What?

19:03.985 --> 19:08.312
Now, hang on.
That's not very appropriate, Grainne.

19:32.513 --> 19:34.698
Mrs. Cullen?

19:36.250 --> 19:40.338
- You are pregnant.
- I fucking knew it!

19:41.188 --> 19:43.799
I just can't believe it!

19:43.899 --> 19:48.497
- I've waited so long for this.
- However, we're not certain with what.

19:48.597 --> 19:52.367
Well, if it's a boy or a girl,
that doesn't matter to me.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.670
We'd like to run some further tests.

19:54.770 --> 19:58.157
Although, if the results
indicate a false positive,

19:58.257 --> 20:02.844
we'd need to operate immediately
and remove... it.

20:03.044 --> 20:05.247
I'm pregnant.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.919
Did... did you understand what I said?

20:11.019 --> 20:15.724
It's totally grand, boy or girl, whatever
I get, I'm happy. I am so happy.

20:15.824 --> 20:20.503
Were you with somebody recently,
or some animal of some kind?

20:20.603 --> 20:21.830
No.

20:21.930 --> 20:26.568
Okay, have you ever seen
the Hollywood movie Rosemary's Baby?

20:26.668 --> 20:32.022
- Yeah.
- If you replace "baby" with "reptile"...

20:34.041 --> 20:38.695
that's what you have.
It's like Rosemary's reptile.

21:03.437 --> 21:05.955
Grainne, what is this?

21:06.741 --> 21:09.293
Grainne, what is this?

21:09.843 --> 21:12.563
Grainne, what is this?

21:35.136 --> 21:37.520
Stop smiling!

21:55.243 --> 21:56.558
<i>Nan just called.</i>

21:56.658 --> 21:59.461
<i>She says you look like a 25-year-old
woman from the middle ages,</i>

21:59.561 --> 22:02.431
<i>spliced with a mentally ill circle.</i>

22:02.531 --> 22:08.051
<i>I'm booking an appointment with Dublin zoo.
There's no excuses this time, Liz.</i>

22:24.786 --> 22:27.837
Hi, can I help you with anything?

22:38.266 --> 22:42.170
I'm... I'm really sorry.
That's not really, that's...

22:42.270 --> 22:44.787
That's not really okay.

22:52.780 --> 22:56.051
I'm sorry.
I'm just going to have to take that.

22:56.151 --> 22:59.136
I'm sorry. You're going to have to leave.

23:09.510 --> 23:11.221
<i>What the fuck are you thinking, Liz?</i>

23:11.321 --> 23:13.958
<i>The zoo just called, they said you never
turned up for your appointment.</i>

23:14.058 --> 23:17.673
<i>I know you're probably saying to yourself,
"what if the vet's got it wrong?"</i>

23:17.773 --> 23:21.976
<i>Let me impart some important advice
I learned a long time ago, the hard way.</i>

23:22.076 --> 23:25.094
<i>Vets don't get things wrong.</i>

23:26.213 --> 23:28.650
<i>Giving birth to a snake
is not only suicide,</i>

23:28.750 --> 23:31.620
<i>it's probably the most
wrong-headed thing ever attempted</i>

23:31.720 --> 23:34.723
<i>in the field of human endeavor.</i>

23:34.823 --> 23:40.661
<i>The only thing you have to do to make
our family happy is just come home.</i>

23:40.761 --> 23:42.041
<i>Alone.</i>

24:08.289 --> 24:10.542
It'll all be over soon, I promise.

24:12.077 --> 24:15.329
I need you to help me
get clean of this, okay?

25:50.891 --> 25:53.309
Horrible, isn't it?

25:54.495 --> 25:56.898
You cannot remember.

25:56.998 --> 25:59.682
But you can't forget.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.075
Grainne...

26:03.642 --> 26:06.352
this is your father?

26:08.742 --> 26:11.494
Danny fucking Zuko?

26:12.513 --> 26:15.432
Our little boy is waiting.

26:18.719 --> 26:21.456
Look, I know you think she's different,
but she's not.

26:21.556 --> 26:26.369
She'll run a mile when she claps eyes
on him. Just wanted a normal baby.

26:26.860 --> 26:29.246
It's not fair.

26:30.932 --> 26:34.436
But just look how quickly she forgets.
Don't make me laugh.

26:34.536 --> 26:37.314
She's the same as the rest of them.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.792
I'm so sorry.

26:45.863 --> 26:47.949
I had no idea.

26:48.249 --> 26:51.285
He'd be so damn ugly.

26:51.385 --> 26:53.671
You'd be so beautiful.

27:11.272 --> 27:14.625
Very good, little one. Very good.

27:14.725 --> 27:16.876
Let's go!

27:18.413 --> 27:22.551
I bet there's a whole lotta
disenchanted folk out there

27:22.651 --> 27:27.971
just waiting for a bouncing snake
to lighten up their lives.

27:30.357 --> 27:35.797
I bet if we tap into that lonely
miserable demographic,

27:35.897 --> 27:38.367
in a few short years and a bit of luck,

27:38.467 --> 27:42.151
we might just hit pre-Patrick numbers.

28:36.590 --> 28:39.878
Time to close your eyes and go to sleep.

28:40.128 --> 28:43.365
It's a special day tomorrow.
Someone's coming tonight.

28:43.465 --> 28:45.066
I'll give you a hint.

28:45.166 --> 28:48.135
He's furry.

28:48.235 --> 28:50.437
And he hops.

28:50.537 --> 28:54.475
And you wake up in the morning
and you get...

28:54.575 --> 28:58.346
- Candy eggs and candy chicks.
- Yes. But here's the thing.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.448
No kid has ever seen him.

29:00.548 --> 29:04.819
Because all the kids are supposed
to be asleep when he comes. Okay?

29:04.919 --> 29:08.945
- Okay.
- Okay. Close your eyes.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.378
Wait.

29:14.328 --> 29:17.824
- I'm scared.
- Why?

29:17.924 --> 29:21.183
Are you afraid you're going
to have a bad dream?

29:22.035 --> 29:25.022
The man coming back from the dead.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.158
What man?

29:27.608 --> 29:29.778
Jesus.

29:29.878 --> 29:34.616
In church they said that Easter was
about him coming back from being dead.

29:34.716 --> 29:38.653
What about the Easter bunny?
Is he dead too?

29:38.753 --> 29:41.922
No, the Easter bunny's different.

29:42.022 --> 29:46.010
- Is Jesus real?
- Yeah, he was real.

29:46.110 --> 29:50.948
- He was?
- Yeah. But he was a good man.

29:51.198 --> 29:54.243
And you know what? Yes, he died,

29:54.343 --> 29:57.672
but when he came back,
that was a good thing.

29:57.772 --> 30:00.208
It was a miracle that he came back.

30:00.308 --> 30:02.536
He flew up into the stars

30:02.636 --> 30:05.613
and he went back where he came from.

30:05.713 --> 30:08.665
And he lives in our hearts now.

30:09.917 --> 30:13.570
It's kind of like a scary version of E.T.

30:14.656 --> 30:17.374
Yeah, but he wasn't a story, he was real.

30:19.360 --> 30:24.098
- What about the Easter bunny?
- Well, the Easter bunny comes on Easter.

30:24.198 --> 30:28.384
But I thought that's when Jesus
came back from the dead.

30:31.738 --> 30:35.143
- No, it's... that's different.
- I don't understand, mommy.

30:35.243 --> 30:38.179
Honey, just close your eyes
and go to sleep.

30:38.279 --> 30:40.690
And tomorrow you are going to wake up

30:40.790 --> 30:43.518
and there will be candy chicks
and eggs and yummy stuff.

30:43.618 --> 30:46.488
But what if I'm awake when he comes?

30:46.588 --> 30:51.025
- What if I get up and get a glass of water?
- It's okay to get a glass of water.

30:51.125 --> 30:55.496
No, but what if he's here?
What if I see him?

30:55.596 --> 30:58.331
Honey. Just go to sleep.

30:58.431 --> 31:00.451
Mommy.

31:00.701 --> 31:03.854
How does he get in the house?

31:04.137 --> 31:06.155
Okay.

31:06.740 --> 31:11.128
I'm gonna count to three,
and I want those eyes shut.

31:11.278 --> 31:14.597
All right? One.

31:14.715 --> 31:16.733
Two.

31:19.186 --> 31:21.170
Three.

31:22.956 --> 31:28.044
You're going to wake up tomorrow and
it's going to be exactly like last year.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.985
Mommy?

31:37.971 --> 31:40.808
Last year, Daddy was here.

31:40.908 --> 31:43.993
Will he ever come back?

31:46.213 --> 31:47.798
Maybe.

31:48.148 --> 31:50.733
Go to sleep, baby.

33:35.088 --> 33:37.073
Mommy?

36:18.418 --> 36:21.004
This is a dream.

36:21.354 --> 36:23.839
You're not real.

36:36.736 --> 36:39.288
Touch me.

37:10.971 --> 37:13.889
No child has ever seen me.

37:14.207 --> 37:19.412
I won't... I won't tell anyone
I saw you. I promise.

37:19.512 --> 37:23.899
But now that you've seen me.
Now it is your turn.

37:25.051 --> 37:28.188
You must take my place.

37:28.288 --> 37:31.274
Take... take your place?

37:31.992 --> 37:36.812
You will see things few have ever seen.

37:37.931 --> 37:40.433
Magical things.

37:40.533 --> 37:44.153
But what if... what if I don't want to?

37:45.138 --> 37:47.456
You have no choice.

37:49.709 --> 37:53.896
Can I... can I come back and see my mommy?

37:56.449 --> 37:59.782
Where you're going,
you will never see your mommy

37:59.882 --> 38:03.357
ever, ever again.

38:27.564 --> 38:30.683
Now close your eyes.

39:21.434 --> 39:23.452
Honey?

39:24.437 --> 39:26.455
Honey?

39:30.077 --> 39:32.094
Honey?

40:11.484 --> 40:15.122
You know, there are only
a few days in any woman's cycle

40:15.222 --> 40:18.726
where she's capable of conceiving.

40:18.826 --> 40:23.279
And you're on,
generic high dose progestin?

40:23.630 --> 40:27.362
Do you take it at the same time
every day? You're sure?

40:27.968 --> 40:30.688
He wears two condoms.

40:31.639 --> 40:35.242
I ask him to wear two condoms.
Sometimes three.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.726
And you've terminated
nearly 20 pregnancies?

40:51.826 --> 40:53.877
I've stopped counting.

40:54.127 --> 40:55.897
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

40:55.997 --> 40:58.265
I've been to see so many doctors.

40:58.365 --> 41:01.551
My family won't talk to me.

41:01.701 --> 41:05.072
My friends think I'm insane,

41:05.172 --> 41:08.324
or making it up, or just...

41:13.045 --> 41:15.064
It's...

41:18.351 --> 41:21.003
It's like I'm cursed.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.227
I don't usually do this.

41:26.327 --> 41:29.664
But it does feel like
you've exhausted all other options.

41:29.764 --> 41:32.666
I'm going to give you
my sister's phone number.

41:32.766 --> 41:38.639
She volunteers at these weekend
fertility ceremonies in the high desert.

41:38.739 --> 41:43.244
Maybe she can give you some sort of insight
that the rest of us haven't been able to.

41:43.344 --> 41:46.361
Thank you. Thank you.

41:46.879 --> 41:50.151
It's probably not for me,
but I appreciate it.

41:50.251 --> 41:53.054
Kate, if what you've told me is true

41:53.154 --> 41:56.868
then I don't think
conventional medicine can help you.

42:07.434 --> 42:09.637
<i>What happens at the ceremony?</i>

42:09.737 --> 42:13.707
<i>Well, have you ever participated
in a peyote ceremony</i>

42:13.807 --> 42:17.645
<i>or ayahuasca,
or any kind of ceremonial medicine?</i>

42:17.745 --> 42:19.114
<i>Well, no.</i>

42:19.214 --> 42:22.606
<i>It can be an intense experience.</i>

42:23.786 --> 42:28.737
<i>But if you're open to it, I think
that you can really learn something.</i>

42:35.395 --> 42:37.798
I know I'm going
to get pregnant this time.

42:37.898 --> 42:41.752
I know it. Sometimes it takes many times
to come here before you do.

42:41.852 --> 42:45.773
I think you have to let go of the trying.
- - Yeah, I get nervous sometimes.

42:45.873 --> 42:50.626
Make yourself at home.
The ceremony will start in an hour.

42:54.314 --> 42:55.583
How old are you?

42:55.683 --> 42:58.386
- Twenty-four.
- What's the rush?

42:58.486 --> 43:01.539
I'm actually not trying
to have a baby right now.

43:01.639 --> 43:04.322
Then what are you doing here?

43:04.524 --> 43:07.543
I get pregnant every time I have sex.

43:09.628 --> 43:12.046
Sounds rough.

44:51.265 --> 44:53.367
You...

44:53.467 --> 44:57.101
are a gateway.

44:58.153 --> 45:02.457
I have to go home.
No, I have to get out of here.

45:04.177 --> 45:06.213
I have to go home.
No, I don't want to be here.

45:06.313 --> 45:08.922
It's just the medicine.

45:09.743 --> 45:13.056
Just trust it. It's just the medicine.

45:18.792 --> 45:21.562
Every time you end the life inside of you,

45:21.662 --> 45:24.813
it will come back stronger.

46:38.939 --> 46:40.507
<i>Sleep.</i>

46:40.607 --> 46:42.942
<i>Sleep, little bird.</i>

46:43.042 --> 46:46.412
<i>When the time comes do not resist.</i>

46:46.512 --> 46:48.765
<i>Do not say no.</i>

47:57.917 --> 48:00.669
Good morning, sleepyhead.

48:01.687 --> 48:04.540
Do you want a bath today?

48:05.424 --> 48:07.342
Yeah.

48:07.627 --> 48:09.645
Okay.

48:10.196 --> 48:14.883
One, two, three, up.

48:16.802 --> 48:18.820
Okay.

48:29.148 --> 48:32.367
You're gonna be such a good mama.

48:32.718 --> 48:35.670
You've been very patient.

48:51.003 --> 48:53.240
I think we need to increase her dose.

48:53.340 --> 48:56.276
No, we can't give her
more than three drops.

48:56.376 --> 48:58.927
It's not good for the baby.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.883
Lily, she's fine.

49:02.983 --> 49:06.001
- Morning.
- Sister.

49:06.686 --> 49:11.924
- Started getting so hot out there.
- Yeah, it always heats up in May.

49:12.024 --> 49:16.645
Happy mother's day, mama.
We're almost there.

49:27.773 --> 49:31.011
Blood pressure is a little high.

49:31.111 --> 49:34.498
- Has anybody tried calling her phone?
- No, poor girl.

49:34.748 --> 49:36.183
How's she been this week?

49:36.283 --> 49:40.187
Not so good. I mean, we could
use you around here more often.

49:40.287 --> 49:43.455
Well, I can't spend all my time out here,
I'm going back and forth enough as it is.

49:43.555 --> 49:45.692
You don't know what it's like here.
It's really hard.

49:45.792 --> 49:47.794
I am here every weekend.
I'm going back and forth.

49:47.894 --> 49:50.731
Yeah, I think you should stay with her
from here on out. It's the last month.

49:50.831 --> 49:53.600
I can't take a whole month
off of work, Lily.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.684
- God damn it, you idiot!
- Don't yell at her.

49:56.784 --> 49:59.172
No wonder she has high blood pressure,
living here with you guys.

49:59.272 --> 50:04.883
- She can't hear us anyways.
- Come. Come with me. Come on.

50:11.350 --> 50:13.301
Okay.

50:16.055 --> 50:18.958
Classical or contemporary today?

50:19.058 --> 50:22.110
I'm feeling contemporary.

50:54.427 --> 50:56.329
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

50:56.429 --> 51:01.516
My name is Kate Polson.

51:01.701 --> 51:05.973
I'm... I've been kidnapped.

51:06.073 --> 51:08.508
<i>I can't hear you, miss, can you speak up?</i>

51:08.608 --> 51:10.477
I need help.

51:10.577 --> 51:16.698
- <i>Fire, ambulance, or police?</i>
- Police, please. Please hurry.

51:16.849 --> 51:19.135
<i>What's the address?</i>

51:22.155 --> 51:26.880
It's like, it's a house.
Ten miles north of the highway...

51:33.098 --> 51:35.550
Oh, God!

51:42.441 --> 51:44.677
Be careful.

51:44.777 --> 51:46.929
Careful!

51:49.348 --> 51:51.919
- That was stupid, look what you did!
- What's happening?

51:52.019 --> 51:54.154
She's going in to labor,
that's what's happening.

51:54.254 --> 51:55.989
God. Okay.

51:56.089 --> 51:59.374
Just breathe. Just breathe.

52:00.192 --> 52:03.545
The more you accept it,
the easier it will be.

52:04.465 --> 52:08.783
All right, come on, just push.
Push for me.

52:10.703 --> 52:12.372
Good girl.

52:12.472 --> 52:17.845
Push, Kate. Push.
Almost there, almost there.

53:08.527 --> 53:10.230
Probably not.

53:10.330 --> 53:14.015
Yeah, I'm going to be here
grading these papers all weekend.

53:15.134 --> 53:17.255
Yeah, I know, it's 52 this year.

54:36.415 --> 54:38.900
<i>Hi, Carol.</i>

54:39.618 --> 54:43.371
<i>It's me. Your daddy.</i>

54:45.224 --> 54:49.677
<i>I'm so sorry. Daddy had to leave you.</i>

54:50.095 --> 54:54.349
<i>I never loved anything more than you.</i>

54:56.302 --> 54:58.888
<i>You were my miracle.</i>

54:59.238 --> 55:03.791
<i>I wanted so badly for you to come with me.</i>

55:04.276 --> 55:07.028
<i>For us to be together.</i>

55:08.414 --> 55:10.751
<i>Your mother and I,</i>

55:10.851 --> 55:15.036
<i>we just didn't see things the same way.</i>

55:15.387 --> 55:21.026
<i>It's so important that you know
it wasn't your fault.</i>

55:21.126 --> 55:25.429
<i>And that you know that I am so...</i>

55:25.529 --> 55:29.951
<i>so sorry I wasn't there for you.</i>

55:35.975 --> 55:38.311
<i>If you're hearing this message,</i>

55:38.411 --> 55:42.114
<i>I... I can't imagine the pain</i>

55:42.214 --> 55:44.684
<i>that I've caused you.</i>

55:44.784 --> 55:49.771
<i>But it's not too late
for us to be together.</i>

55:50.222 --> 55:54.027
<i>I left this message in trust
with good people.</i>

55:54.127 --> 55:58.397
<i>I told them to give this to you
when you were old enough,</i>

55:58.497 --> 56:00.901
<i>strong enough.</i>

56:01.001 --> 56:04.619
<i>I didn't want
to leave you there all alone.</i>

56:05.637 --> 56:08.457
<i>It wasn't my choice.</i>

56:08.807 --> 56:12.277
<i>So... if you want to see me,</i>

56:12.377 --> 56:16.783
<i>to find me, continue where we left off,</i>

56:16.883 --> 56:21.520
<i>I can be there for you now.
If you're ready.</i>

56:21.620 --> 56:24.290
<i>Just go to where we played that day,</i>

56:24.390 --> 56:26.593
<i>our last day together.</i>

56:26.693 --> 56:30.363
<i>Go there, turn the tape over,</i>

56:30.463 --> 56:35.016
<i>press play and I will guide you.</i>

56:35.234 --> 56:38.805
<i>You will always be my baby,
no matter what you choose.</i>

56:38.905 --> 56:43.509
<i>I just hope you'll have it
in you to forgive me.</i>

56:43.609 --> 56:48.296
<i>Remember, Daddy loves you forever, Carol.</i>

56:52.825 --> 56:57.204
This isn't fair. This isn't fucking fair.

56:57.757 --> 57:01.226
How could you do this to me, Mom?

57:01.326 --> 57:05.065
All these years? He was alive?

57:05.165 --> 57:07.982
I missed him so much.

57:09.034 --> 57:12.688
You fucking call me back
the minute you get this.

57:12.938 --> 57:14.956
Bitch!

58:38.323 --> 58:42.761
- <i>Carol! Come on, baby, it's time to go!</i>
- <i>Five more minutes?</i>

58:42.861 --> 58:46.132
<i>Okay, five more minutes,
then we have to go.</i>

58:46.232 --> 58:48.449
<i>Okay!</i>

58:49.901 --> 58:51.972
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

58:52.072 --> 58:55.542
<i>I hope that you've come,
and are ready to see me again.</i>

58:55.642 --> 58:59.185
<i>Listen carefully,
and I'll help you find me.</i>

58:59.285 --> 59:03.383
- <i>I'm ready, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Yeah, okay, you got your backpack?</i>

59:03.483 --> 59:05.501
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:06.785 --> 59:09.622
<i>Hey, let's go this way today, okay?</i>

59:09.722 --> 59:14.327
- <i>Where are we going?</i>
- <i>First we're going towards the exit.</i>

59:14.427 --> 59:17.864
<i>Then we are headed south,
on Revelle Avenue.</i>

59:17.964 --> 59:20.600
<i>South? Where's south?</i>

59:20.700 --> 59:25.487
<i>It's this way.
Come, let's hold hands while crossing.</i>

59:28.307 --> 59:30.877
<i>How come you're carrying that?</i>

59:30.977 --> 59:34.146
<i>I'm making a message for a friend.</i>

59:34.246 --> 59:36.582
<i>Do I know them?</i>

59:36.682 --> 59:40.067
<i>Yes, honey. You know them.</i>

59:40.485 --> 59:43.105
Turn right on third.

59:43.455 --> 59:48.175
- <i>What's it say?</i>
- <i>Just where to find us.</i>

59:48.593 --> 59:50.495
<i>Why?</i>

59:50.595 --> 59:53.213
<i>Because they need help.</i>

59:57.936 --> 01:00:00.440
<i>Look at this, Dad!</i>

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.858
<i>That's a good looking stick.</i>

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:06.011
<i>It looks like a magic wand.</i>

01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:08.930
<i>It does look magic.</i>

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.257
- <i>How much further?</i>
- <i>We're almost there.</i>

01:00:18.357 --> 01:00:22.028
<i>Go left at Marmont coming up.</i>

01:00:22.128 --> 01:00:26.047
<i>I promise this will all
make sense in the end.</i>

01:00:27.099 --> 01:00:32.219
<i>Walk to 433 Marmont.</i>

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:36.742
<i>You know that I love you very much, right?</i>

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.812
<i>I love you too, Daddy.</i>

01:00:38.912 --> 01:00:42.282
<i>And that I only want what is best for us.</i>

01:00:42.382 --> 01:00:44.917
<i>That's why I picked you up today, honey.</i>

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:47.554
<i>Daddy has to go somewhere</i>

01:00:47.654 --> 01:00:50.690
<i>and I needed to see you before I left.</i>

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:55.995
- <i>Where are you going?</i>
- <i>I'm going to a very special place.</i>

01:00:56.095 --> 01:00:59.365
<i>But don't worry,
you'll come and visit me soon.</i>

01:00:59.465 --> 01:01:01.968
<i>Always remember this, Carol,</i>

01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:04.570
<i>the person who risks nothing,</i>

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:07.573
<i>has nothing, is nothing,</i>

01:01:07.673 --> 01:01:09.942
<i>and becomes nothing.</i>

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:14.346
- <i>I don't want you to go.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

01:01:14.446 --> 01:01:17.064
<i>But I have to.</i>

01:01:17.816 --> 01:01:19.985
<i>We're here.</i>

01:01:20.085 --> 01:01:23.270
<i>The front door should be open.</i>

01:01:24.323 --> 01:01:27.444
<i>You'll come see me
as soon as you're ready.</i>

01:01:27.794 --> 01:01:31.512
- <i>I'm ready.</i>
- <i>I wish you were.</i>

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:37.018
- <i>But I'll miss you.</i>
- <i>I'll miss you more than you'll ever know.</i>

01:01:38.804 --> 01:01:41.824
<i>Come, we have to go inside.</i>

01:01:42.174 --> 01:01:45.181
<i>Here, let Daddy carry you.</i>

01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:59.558
<i>Why do you have to go?</i>

01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:01.777
<i>Be strong for Daddy.</i>

01:02:03.795 --> 01:02:06.573
<i>We're almost together again.</i>

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.551
<i>You are so close now.</i>

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:14.072
<i>What's that picture?</i>

01:02:14.172 --> 01:02:16.375
<i>It's called an icon.</i>

01:02:16.475 --> 01:02:19.247
<i>It's a symbol of faith.</i>

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.623
<i>Okay, honey, will you sit here
and wait for Daddy?</i>

01:02:31.723 --> 01:02:34.827
<i>I have to go talk
to that nice lady over there.</i>

01:02:34.927 --> 01:02:37.663
- <i>You're not going yet, are you?</i>
- <i>Not yet.</i>

01:02:37.763 --> 01:02:40.600
<i>I just need to talk to the lady.</i>

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.736
- <i>Promise?</i>
- <i>I promise.</i>

01:02:43.836 --> 01:02:45.372
<i>Okay.</i>

01:02:45.472 --> 01:02:50.191
<i>You're such a strong girl,
and I am so proud of you.</i>

01:02:56.948 --> 01:03:01.235
<i>I'm here for my appointment,
to speak with you.</i>

01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:17.002
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:03:17.102 --> 01:03:19.138
<i>Once I go,</i>

01:03:19.238 --> 01:03:23.457
<i>will you make sure
that she's taken care of?</i>

01:03:24.876 --> 01:03:28.213
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

01:03:28.313 --> 01:03:32.018
- <i>Dad! Dad!</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:03:32.118 --> 01:03:36.155
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:44.780
<i>It wasn't my choice, Carol.</i>

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.933
<i>You...</i>

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:51.470
<i>You only get once chance to meet him,</i>

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.154
<i>to visit this place.</i>

01:03:55.173 --> 01:03:58.410
<i>That's why I made this for you,</i>

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:02.279
<i>and I pray that it found you,</i>

01:04:02.914 --> 01:04:05.933
<i>so that you may find me.</i>

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.112
<i>I'll be so happy to see you again.</i>

01:04:20.966 --> 01:04:23.893
<i>It will have been so long.</i>

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.088
Dad?

01:04:36.114 --> 01:04:37.884
Daddy?

01:04:37.984 --> 01:04:40.568
<i>Hello, baby.</i>

01:04:41.019 --> 01:04:43.222
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

01:04:43.322 --> 01:04:46.142
- <i>I'm so happy that you came.</i>
- Dad!

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:50.128
<i>Daddy loves you so much, Carol.</i>

01:04:50.228 --> 01:04:52.665
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:58.486
<i>If you have come, and you have
found me, then you are here.</i>

01:04:58.586 --> 01:05:02.809
- <i>You're finally here in this room...</i>
- Daddy, it's me.

01:05:02.909 --> 01:05:06.646
- <i>...of your own free will.</i>
- Please, Daddy.

01:05:06.746 --> 01:05:13.496
<i>Oh, Carol, that means that you,
and I, can be together again.</i>

01:05:23.094 --> 01:05:25.479
<i>Together.</i>

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.040
Hi, is this Shelby?

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.642
Yeah, you responded to my ad online.

01:06:10.742 --> 01:06:13.762
My name's Ian. How are you?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.432
Where are you from, by the way?

01:06:16.582 --> 01:06:19.051
Des Moines! Oh, fuck.

01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:22.354
You probably want
to get out of there so badly.

01:06:22.454 --> 01:06:24.524
Yeah, so come to LA.

01:06:24.624 --> 01:06:27.627
No, it's not porn. It's webcam.

01:06:27.727 --> 01:06:29.996
It's honestly exactly like Facetime.

01:06:30.096 --> 01:06:32.632
You probably already do
the same shit with your boyfriends.

01:06:32.732 --> 01:06:37.018
Except now, you can get paid
while you do it. Large.

01:06:37.268 --> 01:06:39.672
Last week one of the girls
made eight grand.

01:06:39.772 --> 01:06:42.256
How's it sound to you?

01:06:42.807 --> 01:06:45.978
Good? Oh, that's amazing!

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:48.948
That's amazing!
I'm super excited about that.

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:51.918
Okay, so we'll get everything
squared away immediately.

01:06:52.018 --> 01:06:53.853
Hi, is this Allison?

01:06:53.953 --> 01:06:58.424
Yeah, you responded to my ad online.
Yeah, the webcam stuff.

01:06:58.524 --> 01:07:02.595
No, no, no, no, it's nothing like porno.
It's nothing like porno at all.

01:07:02.695 --> 01:07:05.331
It's on your webcam.
It's pretty much Facetime.

01:07:05.431 --> 01:07:09.302
I mean, you probably already do
the same thing with your boyfriends.

01:07:09.402 --> 01:07:12.805
Yeah. It includes a free ticket
to the heart of Hollywood.

01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:16.341
You'll be set up,
staying in a beautiful apartment.

01:07:16.441 --> 01:07:19.970
What do you tell your parents?
I don't know. Fuck your parents.

01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:25.952
<i>Stirring our cauldron of magic are we!</i>

01:07:26.052 --> 01:07:30.505
<i>A witch's power is strongest in threes.</i>

01:07:32.024 --> 01:07:35.794
Like, what the fuck are
these bitches cooking, man?

01:07:35.894 --> 01:07:40.448
They're not cooking. That's a cauldron.
They're actually casting spells.

01:07:43.902 --> 01:07:47.055
- I just had a fucking asshole.
- What happened?

01:07:49.641 --> 01:07:52.111
He was writing all this shit
that he wanted to do to me.

01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:55.131
And then when he signed off...

01:07:57.249 --> 01:07:59.150
He called me a whore!

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:02.054
Serenes. I'm so sorry.

01:08:02.154 --> 01:08:04.607
Man, what a fucking fuckhole, man.

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:09.856
You got his credit card number, right?
So, fuck this asshole, let's go shopping.

01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:14.581
I can e-mail you
a ticket right away, Allison.

01:08:15.033 --> 01:08:18.957
Your boyfriend? Fuck him.
No, you'll be treated like a queen here.

01:08:19.058 --> 01:08:21.212
I promise.

01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:24.959
Okay. Bye now.

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:30.381
The fuck is this?

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:33.319
- Nobody's working?
- Nobody's calling.

01:08:33.419 --> 01:08:37.475
- It's Halloween. Everyone's out partying.
- Except us.

01:08:37.854 --> 01:08:42.343
That's sad. Trick or treat, skank.

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:52.004
Did you scrape that shit out yet?
I want to eat my hot pockets.

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:56.274
- Can I have one of your hot pockets?
- I gave you your dinner.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:59.211
Fuck your three
for a dollar discount shit.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:03.180
What's wrong with name Brand Candy,
you ever heard of Hersheys?

01:09:03.281 --> 01:09:05.885
Yeah, I heard of Hershey.

01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:10.957
Hersheys is what my grandmother
used to say, is for ladies.

01:09:11.057 --> 01:09:16.026
I added this part.
Discount stuff is for whores.

01:09:16.126 --> 01:09:18.663
- Whores!
- What is wrong with this girl?

01:09:18.764 --> 01:09:22.868
Some cam asshole called her
a whore and then signed off.

01:09:22.969 --> 01:09:27.273
They're supposed to type dirty shit.
That's why they give us their money.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.742
Well, nobody's giving us
their money tonight.

01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:31.810
Yeah, so why don't you
give us the night off

01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:36.330
so we can cheer Serena up
and celebrate Halloween?

01:09:38.683 --> 01:09:40.701
Okay.

01:09:41.653 --> 01:09:45.491
Oh, no, wait. Wait.
I meant to say, fuck no.

01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:46.926
Don't be a dick, Ian.

01:09:47.026 --> 01:09:49.962
No, fuck you, Holly.
I'm sick of your shit.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:52.497
I'm sick of all of your shits, okay?

01:09:52.598 --> 01:09:54.734
I just got off the phone with two...

01:09:54.834 --> 01:09:58.470
two. Count 'em. Two cam girls.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:03.042
Oh, yeah. They want to come
to Hollywood, and work for me.

01:10:03.142 --> 01:10:06.002
So, A.B.C.

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:09.782
Always be camming, bitches.

01:10:09.882 --> 01:10:13.653
'Cause the next generation's coming,
and they're going to replace you.

01:10:13.753 --> 01:10:17.289
Just like you replaced
the whores before you.

01:10:17.389 --> 01:10:18.591
Stop saying "whores"!

01:10:18.691 --> 01:10:21.492
No! I'll say "whores"
if I want to say "whores"!

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:24.195
I'll say "whores" if I want.

01:10:24.295 --> 01:10:27.014
Now you got me irritated.

01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:33.087
And since it's such a slow night...

01:10:33.338 --> 01:10:36.191
why don't I put one of you sluts to work?

01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:38.693
How does that sound?

01:10:38.793 --> 01:10:40.546
So who's it going to be?

01:10:40.646 --> 01:10:43.344
One of you girls is going
to show me your pussy.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.302
No.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.307
We're not girls, Ian. We're women.

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:57.112
I was a girl when I got here, but after
working for you for eight fucking months,

01:10:57.262 --> 01:10:59.732
now I'm sad to say, I'm a woman.

01:10:59.832 --> 01:11:02.702
I'm the oldest 18-year old woman I know.

01:11:02.802 --> 01:11:06.571
All because I made
a big mistake in coming here.

01:11:06.671 --> 01:11:10.059
But you know what?
The more I think about it,

01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:15.114
the more I realize I'm not the only one
that made the mistake, Ian.

01:11:15.214 --> 01:11:18.665
You made a big mistake.

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:24.290
Wanna know why? Because you put
three women in a room together.

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:28.727
Do you know what three women
in a room together used to be called?

01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:31.647
A coven. You got that?

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:33.615
Witches.

01:11:34.699 --> 01:11:38.270
And the power of witches
is always strongest in threes.

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:40.504
You fuck.

01:11:42.808 --> 01:11:44.609
Witches, now?

01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:46.812
Witches. Okay.

01:11:46.912 --> 01:11:53.701
Well, which witch is going
to ride this broomstick?

01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:58.706
Yeah.

01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:00.759
- This one.
- No.

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:03.676
- Yes. Yes!
- No! No!

01:12:04.026 --> 01:12:07.281
- I don't wanna!
- Well, you're gonna!

01:12:33.324 --> 01:12:35.776
What the fuck?

01:12:39.697 --> 01:12:42.655
Oh, you fucking bitch.

01:12:43.367 --> 01:12:46.814
The fuck is this shit?

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:51.676
What the fuck is this?

01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:54.529
What the fuck?

01:12:55.129 --> 01:12:57.631
What the fuck?

01:13:09.127 --> 01:13:11.745
What the fuck.

01:13:12.231 --> 01:13:14.774
What the fuck.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.574
What the fuck.

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:31.031
What the fuck?

01:13:51.402 --> 01:13:54.122
What the fuck!

01:13:59.911 --> 01:14:03.063
Okay! Okay! Okay!

01:14:12.757 --> 01:14:15.710
What the fuck do you want?

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.815
What? What the fuck!

01:14:26.237 --> 01:14:29.996
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:34.828
Okay!

01:14:38.382 --> 01:14:43.270
There! You made your point,
take your fucking pictures!

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:53.164
What the fuck?

01:14:53.264 --> 01:14:56.919
I don't have a pussy!
I don't have a pussy!

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:10.415
Are you fucking bitches
fucked in the head?

01:15:10.515 --> 01:15:14.270
What the fuck is wrong with you?
This is fucking insane!

01:15:24.929 --> 01:15:28.049
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:15:28.699 --> 01:15:31.051
Fuck you!

01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:46.185
Please don't make me do this. Please.

01:15:46.285 --> 01:15:50.837
I'll pay you.
I'll fucking pay you, please!

01:15:55.293 --> 01:15:58.080
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

01:16:01.031 --> 01:16:02.951
Okay.

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:09.323
What the fuck. What the fuck.

01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:13.627
This is fucked up. This is fucked!

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.972
Fuck you.

01:16:41.839 --> 01:16:45.292
Fuck you! Fuck you, bitches!

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:56.121
- What the fuck are you crying about?
- Look at all that blood.

01:16:56.221 --> 01:17:01.016
This is getting boring. What happens
if we turn this shit up to ten?

01:17:03.927 --> 01:17:05.879
That.

01:17:11.702 --> 01:17:16.590
Hi. Is Ian here?
He flew me out from Maine to work.

01:17:17.575 --> 01:17:19.859
I'm Nancy.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:25.317
Hello, Nancy. Welcome.

01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:30.022
You're joining us during a period
of transition for the company.

01:17:30.122 --> 01:17:33.674
As of today, we're actually
under new management.

01:17:35.077 --> 01:17:36.595
Well, what happened to Ian?

01:17:36.695 --> 01:17:41.566
Unfortunately, Ian is no longer
with the company, due to...

01:17:41.792 --> 01:17:44.110
cutbacks.

01:18:01.853 --> 01:18:04.811
<i>Your imagination come to life!</i>

01:18:06.925 --> 01:18:11.054
<i>Uvu shows you you!</i>

01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:18.537
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:18:18.637 --> 01:18:21.840
- Your kids are going to love that.
- The kids are definitely going to love it.

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:26.245
- Wait 'til you put it on your head.
- Well, I'll leave... I'll leave that to the kids.

01:18:26.345 --> 01:18:31.054
- Alright. Hope they enjoy. Merry Christmas.
- Yup, thank you. Merry Christmas.

01:18:31.154 --> 01:18:32.362
- Goodnight.
- Hi.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:36.320
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- No, no, no, I called. About the Uvu.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.725
- That guy got the last one.
- What? No. I called.

01:18:39.825 --> 01:18:42.754
- I'm Pete Gunderson. I said I was coming.
- First come, first served.

01:18:42.854 --> 01:18:45.980
- But you...
- Sorry, pal. Holidays are hell.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.686
Fuck.

01:18:52.136 --> 01:18:55.017
Yeah, honey. Got the last one.
Okay, I'll be home in 15.

01:18:55.117 --> 01:18:58.661
- Excuse me. Excuse me, sir? Hi.
- I love you. Bye.

01:18:58.761 --> 01:19:01.880
Look, I'll... I'll give you $300 for it.

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.116
Yeah, not a chance, pal. Try Ebay.

01:19:04.216 --> 01:19:07.322
Wait, wait, wait! Please, please.
I'll... I'll give you...

01:19:07.718 --> 01:19:11.423
I'll give you 500. Please,
it's Christmas Eve. I'm out of time.

01:19:11.523 --> 01:19:14.559
Listen, if it was really that important,
you would have gotten here earlier.

01:19:14.659 --> 01:19:16.861
Merry Christmas.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:20.113
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:19:36.013 --> 01:19:37.832
Oh, my God.

01:19:37.932 --> 01:19:40.516
Oh, my God.

01:19:42.286 --> 01:19:45.006
I'll call...

01:20:06.193 --> 01:20:07.877
Sorry.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:15.587
I finally had it,
and I told Ed he was full of shit.

01:20:15.687 --> 01:20:18.470
I mean, I deserve that Christmas bonus

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:22.294
a hell of a lot more than that do-nothing,
kiss-ass nephew of his.

01:20:22.394 --> 01:20:25.429
I swear I could kill him. Scrooge.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.482
What?

01:20:27.832 --> 01:20:29.768
Have you not been listening to me?

01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:33.371
Ed didn't give me the Christmas bonus
that we were counting on.

01:20:33.471 --> 01:20:35.674
And with you making less money now...

01:20:35.774 --> 01:20:39.125
God. I'm at the end of my rope.

01:20:39.643 --> 01:20:43.997
How much was this thing anyway?
I hope you didn't overspend.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.721
- Stop.
- Come on.

01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:09.756
No.

01:21:22.786 --> 01:21:26.272
I still can't believe you got it, Dad!

01:21:26.891 --> 01:21:28.593
So, you just watch stuff on them?

01:21:28.693 --> 01:21:33.580
Yeah, it aggregates your online identity
to figure out what to show you.

01:21:37.134 --> 01:21:40.922
<i>Congratulations, captain!
You're the first person to walk on Mars.</i>

01:21:41.172 --> 01:21:43.806
You've got to try it, Dad.

01:21:44.356 --> 01:21:48.623
- Am I going to see what you saw?
- No, it's different for everyone.

01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:54.653
<i>Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, Daddy.</i>

01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:57.421
It's totally cool, right?

01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:01.207
Right. Yeah. Totally.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.678
Is this the off button?

01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:43.234
<i>Please don't punish me, Daddy.</i>

01:22:43.334 --> 01:22:47.353
<i>I promise I won't be naughty anymore.</i>

01:23:02.052 --> 01:23:04.222
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:23:04.322 --> 01:23:07.053
I'll call... I'll call...

01:23:10.094 --> 01:23:12.112
Sorry.

01:23:12.996 --> 01:23:15.348
What the fuck?

01:23:20.227 --> 01:23:22.721
- <i>Heart attack?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:22.821 --> 01:23:25.544
<i>Probably would have made it too,
if he got help in time.</i>

01:23:25.644 --> 01:23:28.313
<i>Hell of a Christmas gift for his family.</i>

01:23:28.413 --> 01:23:30.281
<i>Fucking Christmas.</i>

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:32.950
<i>I hear ya, bro.</i>

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.770
<i>Okay. Bag him up.
We need the fridge space.</i>

01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:42.193
Hi! It says on your website that...

01:23:42.293 --> 01:23:45.530
Less than one percent of users
may experience an...

01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:49.401
adverse reaction when using the device?
And I was just... just wondering,

01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:55.340
what type of adverse reactions
are users experiencing exactly?

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.792
<i>Are you having trouble
with your device, sir?</i>

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:02.619
Troub... no...

01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:06.589
No. I'm not, no... Just wondering.

01:24:06.689 --> 01:24:08.582
<i>Well, if you'd like to give me
your name and login,</i>

01:24:08.682 --> 01:24:13.074
<i>I can check your video feed to see
if there's anything abnormal going on.</i>

01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:16.795
You can do that? That's fine.
I don't need that. That's not necessary.

01:24:16.895 --> 01:24:19.278
Thank you very much.

01:24:30.507 --> 01:24:31.839
Sara?

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:36.281
- Where's Bobby?
- I sent him to stay with a friend.

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:40.084
You forgot to log out, Pete.

01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:47.659
I don't know what that showed you, but...

01:24:47.759 --> 01:24:49.727
Everything.

01:24:49.827 --> 01:24:52.378
I saw everything.

01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:56.150
I just want to know one thing.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.118
Why'd you do it?

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.626
Because he had what I wanted...

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:13.499
and I was tired of being nice.

01:25:14.451 --> 01:25:16.870
Oh, Pete.

01:25:17.354 --> 01:25:20.674
That is the hottest thing
you have ever said.

01:26:02.516 --> 01:26:06.036
<i>Hey! Everyone's gone.
I'm going to go ahead and lock up.</i>

01:26:12.943 --> 01:26:17.671
<i>And I made this, just the way you like it.</i>

01:26:21.184 --> 01:26:23.738
<i>Oh, Ed. You don't look so good.</i>

01:26:26.357 --> 01:26:29.175
<i>I hope you aren't afraid of the dark, Ed.</i>

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.612
<i>Should've given me that bonus, Ed.</i>

01:26:46.009 --> 01:26:48.862
This is what happens to scrooges like you.

01:26:51.715 --> 01:26:54.367
Ain't the holidays hell?

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:13.252
Pete, you awake?

01:27:37.695 --> 01:27:40.098
I didn't want to have to do this.

01:27:40.198 --> 01:27:43.216
You know, I kept pushing it off.

01:27:43.436 --> 01:27:47.789
I didn't want to... ruin another holiday.

01:27:49.539 --> 01:27:53.293
I wanted to pretend
like everything was okay.

01:27:54.012 --> 01:27:56.013
But you...

01:27:56.113 --> 01:27:58.264
you.

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:02.835
I mean, I thought that when you...

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:06.273
when you got to know me... you know...

01:28:06.373 --> 01:28:11.043
when you saw the real me, that you'd...

01:28:13.096 --> 01:28:15.581
Never mind.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:18.369
Tonight at midnight,

01:28:18.469 --> 01:28:21.673
I want to kiss someone
who makes me feel...

01:28:21.773 --> 01:28:25.057
like I can take the tape off their lips.

01:28:31.248 --> 01:28:33.699
God damn it.

01:28:47.732 --> 01:28:50.805
Sorry about that. Let me try that again.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.991
Jesus Christ.

01:29:06.316 --> 01:29:09.129
Mandy. Mandy.

01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:11.030
Hey.

01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:48.090
Can't be worse than the last one.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.169
How is it?

01:29:58.269 --> 01:30:01.171
They're great.
They're the best chicken fingers.

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:04.156
They bread them with frosted flakes.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.878
My mom didn't let me eat sugary cereal.

01:30:06.978 --> 01:30:09.514
You know, rots your teeth.

01:30:09.614 --> 01:30:11.682
My teeth aren't rotten.

01:30:11.782 --> 01:30:15.087
You must brush a lot. Do you brush a lot?

01:30:15.187 --> 01:30:18.305
I don't know. I guess so.

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.345
Let me see 'em.

01:30:20.445 --> 01:30:23.710
- What?
- Let me see those pearly whites.

01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:28.866
I bet they sparkle.
Let me see those choppers, come on.

01:30:29.366 --> 01:30:32.651
Yeah. I knew it.

01:30:32.936 --> 01:30:35.388
You have great teeth.

01:30:40.544 --> 01:30:43.781
That was... that was... I'm sorry.

01:30:43.881 --> 01:30:48.252
I'm sorry.
That was... it's just the nerves.

01:30:48.352 --> 01:30:50.354
That's the problem
with these first dates, you know.

01:30:50.454 --> 01:30:53.291
If people got to know the real me,
you know, they would love me.

01:30:53.391 --> 01:30:57.471
But, you know, they never get to meet me.
You know, because it's just...

01:30:57.571 --> 01:31:01.797
Because the nerve monster
just rears its ugly head.

01:31:03.633 --> 01:31:07.938
Most guys I date online just want
to hook up. One and done.

01:31:08.038 --> 01:31:11.445
They act like I'm crazy for wanting
something more lasting.

01:31:11.545 --> 01:31:13.571
Right?

01:31:14.015 --> 01:31:19.600
You know, people say that those dating
websites are bullshit but I mean, 96%?

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:22.286
I mean, like,
that's an all-time high for me.

01:31:22.386 --> 01:31:24.555
My last girlfriend was like
an 84% and, you know,

01:31:24.655 --> 01:31:28.308
yeah, no surprise that didn't...
that didn't turn out.

01:31:29.158 --> 01:31:33.312
- What happened?
- She... I had to...

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:36.715
I had to end it.

01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:40.252
It was for the best.

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:49.262
Sorry. You are so much hotter
than she was.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.083
I mean...

01:31:53.183 --> 01:31:54.585
prettier.

01:31:54.685 --> 01:31:57.170
Should we get the check?

01:32:18.942 --> 01:32:20.711
I'm sorry.

01:32:20.811 --> 01:32:24.014
- For what?
- For calling you hot.

01:32:24.114 --> 01:32:27.518
- Why would you apologize for that?
- Because it made me sound all pervy.

01:32:27.618 --> 01:32:30.921
Like I was trying to hook up with you.

01:32:31.021 --> 01:32:34.981
You know. And I know
you don't like that on a first date.

01:32:37.827 --> 01:32:41.032
It's New Year's Eve. I'd have to be
the most unromantic gal in the world

01:32:41.132 --> 01:32:45.105
to want to go home to a lonely apartment.

01:32:47.336 --> 01:32:49.222
Yup.

01:32:52.009 --> 01:32:55.347
Do you want to go back to my place
and watch the ball drop?

01:33:11.361 --> 01:33:14.313
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yeah.

01:33:26.944 --> 01:33:30.264
- Should I not?
- No. I need to use the restroom.

01:33:30.414 --> 01:33:32.450
You know, I just... I want to freshen up.

01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:37.102
Okay. Great idea.
Down the hall to the right.

01:34:55.085 --> 01:34:57.149
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:02.530
<i>Ten!</i>

01:36:04.902 --> 01:36:07.120
<i>Nine!</i>

01:36:08.806 --> 01:36:10.823
<i>Eight!</i>

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:14.500
<i>Seven!</i>

01:36:15.645 --> 01:36:17.530
<i>Six!</i>

01:36:18.715 --> 01:36:20.493
<i>Five!</i>

01:36:21.668 --> 01:36:23.370
<i>Four!</i>

01:36:24.422 --> 01:36:26.169
<i>Three!</i>

01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:29.475
<i>Two!</i>

01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:32.973
<i>One!</i>

01:36:40.238 --> 01:36:43.235
<i>Feliz año nuevo, cariño.</i>
