WEBVTT

00:13.680 --> 00:14.931
Hm.

00:14.931 --> 00:19.436
How 'bout... truth or dare?

00:19.894 --> 00:22.605
- Do we have to?
- Yes, Linds.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.399
Just because we weren't invited

00:24.399 --> 00:27.068
to Victoria F.'s boy-girl Frenching party

00:27.068 --> 00:29.529
doesn't mean we can't
have fun tonight, too.

00:30.071 --> 00:33.366
- Truth.
- Your biggest fantasy.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.162
Sexual fantasy.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.878
I'm your best friend.
You can tell me anything.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.259
You wanna have sex
with a 74-year-old man?!

00:51.259 --> 00:52.719
No, that's not what I said!

00:52.719 --> 00:55.805
He's a widower, Lindsay.
For crying out loud.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.057
A-A-And a veteran.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.850
And now the whole school
is talking about it.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.019
Lindsay and Mr. Tucker.

01:01.019 --> 01:05.315
I said <i>a</i> librarian.
Not <i>the</i> librarian. <i>A</i> librarian.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.817
Do you know what they're
calling our Lindsay now, Tom?

01:08.526 --> 01:09.903
Two words.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.988
The first one is Tucker.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.283
- The second one rhymes.
- But I didn't do anything wrong!

01:15.283 --> 01:18.870
- I just told Celeste that--
- You don't tell people

01:18.870 --> 01:20.288
those things, Lindsay!

01:20.288 --> 01:22.123
You keep those things

01:22.123 --> 01:26.294
up here in your head
where nobody else can see them.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.717
You show people the nice parts.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.180
Because, believe me...

01:37.180 --> 01:39.724
that's all that anybody wants to see.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.445
Did we wake up at the same time?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.155
Again!

02:03.123 --> 02:05.125
I love you.

Ned?!

04:24.722 --> 04:26.140
You won a contest?

04:26.140 --> 04:28.393
The Weetly Short Story Prize.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.728
It's put on by a bookstore
in New York City.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.439
Linds. That's amazing!

04:33.439 --> 04:35.608
Yeah, I, I read about it
a few months ago,

04:35.608 --> 04:38.945
and I just figured, why not?
So, I wrote a story.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.280
What's it about?

04:40.822 --> 04:43.241
Um... it's about a woman

04:43.241 --> 04:47.120
who has never had
an orgasm before.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.788
Heavy.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.208
I mean, not my cup of tea,
but still, congrats.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.880
Yeah, you know, I...
I used to think I, actually,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.925
wanted to be a writer
when I was a kid.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.387
But I... sorta gave it up.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.306
I didn't know that.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.809
You know, the ceremony's
in two weeks.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.644
I was thinking we could go.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.105
Next month's a little
busy for us.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.653
This is gonna sound crazy,
but... what if we move there?

05:21.654 --> 05:25.241
- To New York?
- Ned, I've been thinking a lot about this.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.535
New York is where real
writers live,

05:27.535 --> 05:31.873
and I am starting to think
that, maybe, I am a real writer.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.875
Or I could be.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.003
But you can write here.
We have an hour lunch break.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.713
It's more than just that.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.716
Writing this story,
uh, winning this contest,

05:41.716 --> 05:44.844
it, it feels like maybe
it's a sign.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.680
A sign? (chuckles) Of what?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.600
Well, a sign that maybe

05:51.142 --> 05:54.771
our relationship needs
a new adventure.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.439
You know, s-something different.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.524
Didn't realize you
wanted somethin' different.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.736
Why didn't you tell me?

06:01.736 --> 06:04.447
- Do not say it.
- Careful now.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.491
Keep it to yourself, Linds.

06:06.491 --> 06:12.580
I guess... I just have
all these voices in my head.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.999
- All the time, you know?
- Now you've done it.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.710
And the... voices

06:17.710 --> 06:19.545
they told you not to tell me?

06:19.754 --> 06:21.839
I don't mean,
you know, imaginary friends

06:21.839 --> 06:24.384
or like, "the devil
made me do it."

06:24.509 --> 06:27.095
I'm talking about, you know--
Everyone has them.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.721
The voices that say,

06:28.721 --> 06:31.432
"Don't say how you really feel
because people will hate you

06:31.432 --> 06:32.642
if you do that."

06:32.642 --> 06:34.602
And your, your, your mom's voice

06:34.602 --> 06:36.854
or your best friend
from sixth grade

06:36.854 --> 06:38.189
who ruined your life and

06:38.189 --> 06:40.191
your enjoyment of
the school library.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.692
Oh, wah-wah.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.778
Your history. Your baggage.

06:43.778 --> 06:47.448
All the... noise living
inside your head.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.576
You're startin' to
scare me.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.663
I know you, Linds, and this,

06:55.540 --> 06:56.624
this isn't you.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.335
I think you need a
good night's sleep

06:59.335 --> 07:02.255
and everything will be
better in the morning.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.978
- Did we wake up at the same--
- I've been up since four.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.775
<i>♪ Gee, it's nice

07:22.775 --> 07:26.070

Whoa! PB&J instead of turkey?

07:45.756 --> 07:48.551
I'm sorry.
Is it Christmas?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.052
I'm leaving you.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.559
Don't do this, Linds.
Come on.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.936
You can't just move
to New York City.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.980
This isn't
<i>Muppets Take Manhattan.</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:03.441
You need to stop and
think this through.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.527
I am not listening
to you anymore.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.947
Lindsay, I hate to remind you,

08:09.947 --> 08:12.283
but your great-grandfather
Jedediah

08:12.283 --> 08:14.869
was murdered in New
York City in 1920.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.830
Ned is perfect for you.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.624
He's everything you've
ever wanted.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.834
I've spent my whole life
listening to you

08:21.834 --> 08:23.294
and look where it's gotten me.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.379
No more. I'm done.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.175
You can keep following
me around forever,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.886
but from now on,
I'm doing what I wanna do.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.476
What am I gonna tell everyone?

08:40.978 --> 08:43.189
Tell 'em I changed my mind.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.613
Hey.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.168
Thank you... Thank you so much.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.471
As I said
on the telephone, the bedroom isn't huge.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.890
Oh, well, I, I don't
need a lotta space,

09:17.890 --> 09:20.268
you know,
just enough room to write.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.187
- I'm a writer.
- Yes, you've said that a few times.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.564
Do you have a job?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.399
Not yet. I'm, uh,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.025
I'm actually waiting
on some prize money.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.485
You know, it's probably
not a ton,

09:29.485 --> 09:31.445
but every little bit counts,

09:31.445 --> 09:32.905
especially since I

09:32.905 --> 09:36.158
emptied out my savings account
to move here, so.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.660
Okay, keep going.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.620
Mm.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.622
Mm.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.249
Wow, look at this.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.834
Great bones.

09:46.002 --> 09:46.836
Hm.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.797
'Kay, drum roll, please.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.928
Uh, it's perfect.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.348
And it's, it's huge.
It's too big, almost.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.517
Uh, no. This is my bedroom.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.019
That's yours.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.520
Oh.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.653
It's not a closet.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.408
I didn't say it was a--

10:17.408 --> 10:20.620
In case you were thinking it was
just my bedroom closet, it isn't.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.956
- There is a hanger rod.
- That's for decoration.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.794
I love it.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.387
Hi.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.768
Hi, I'm... I'm here
for the ceremony.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.854
Wiccan meet-up is
Thursday nights.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.649
No, no, I--
I'm Lindsay.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.694
Lindsay Arthur. The... writer.

10:53.694 --> 10:58.199
The winner
of the Weetly Short Story Prize.

10:59.533 --> 11:00.701
The what?

11:01.285 --> 11:05.748
The Weetly... Short...
Story Prize.

11:05.748 --> 11:09.001
See, it says here
that the ceremony is today.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.380
That's the <i>Weekly...</i>
Short Story Prize.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.756
That's a typo.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.221
The word "ceremony"...
it's ironic.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.935
Here's $15 store credit
for anything you might want.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.439
Congratulations, by the way.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.734
Okay.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.572
Thank you... for this.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.746
Are you hiring?

11:55.673 --> 11:59.009
- Another night on the sofa?
- Long day at the bookstore.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.511
Some prankster thought
it would be a laugh

12:00.511 --> 12:03.055
to re-alphabetize Memoirs
by subject matter.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.350
I don't get you.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.102
You've been here for
almost a month.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.603
Every day you come
back from work

12:09.603 --> 12:11.397
and you put on
those little girl pajamas

12:11.731 --> 12:13.482
when you said you came
to New York to write.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.736
- Where's the writing?
- I'm writing. It's just my

12:17.403 --> 12:20.448
laptop died and the...
cord doesn't reach the couch.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.453
Well, if you're just going to spend
your time watching TV...

12:25.453 --> 12:26.746
...alone,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.831
eating microwave meals for diabetics,

12:29.248 --> 12:30.541
then why are you here?

12:33.878 --> 12:34.920
Whatever.

12:35.755 --> 12:40.676
I'll be at the sort
of gross place on Spring Street

12:44.263 --> 12:46.265
if you decide to not be so lame.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.864
Yeah, it's-- I wanna put
myself out there,

17:11.864 --> 17:13.991
but it is scary, you know?

17:13.991 --> 17:17.369
Look at me now.
I'm in a real New York City bar

17:17.369 --> 17:19.121
drinkin' a real New York City--

17:19.121 --> 17:23.125
I just need you to wait here.
Guard the door. Let's go.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.418
Whoa, whoa.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.253
One sec, sir.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.174
Are you gonna have sex

17:30.174 --> 17:31.884
in the bathroom?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.094
Do you even know this guy?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.763
I find it's better not to.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.769
You are exactly the
person I wanna be.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.438
No shame, no guilt.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.232
Whatever you hear,
don't come in.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.452
<i>Don't come in.</i>

18:00.704 --> 18:02.122
<i>I won't.</i>

18:10.380 --> 18:12.341
Nice pants.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.887
Thanks. They're new.
I mean, they're not new.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.389
I've worn them a lot.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.725
I wear them a lot.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.728
Well, it sounds like
they have a very rich history.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.897
Are you waiting for
the bathroom?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
Actually, my roommate is--

18:30.734 --> 18:32.653
Well, she's having sex

18:32.653 --> 18:35.364
with a stranger in there, actually.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.201
- Yes.
- Wow.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.829
Yeah, should we go next?

18:42.496 --> 18:45.165
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
I was trying to be funny.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.042
That was supposed to
be a joke,

18:47.042 --> 18:49.086
- but I--
- No, no, no. No, it's just, um,

18:49.795 --> 18:52.798
I'm pretty sure
you need to make reservations.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.092
They're sticklers here.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.886
Right... I mean, that
does make sense.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.055
You know, you wouldn't want
just anyone

19:00.055 --> 19:00.973
waltzing in off the street

19:00.973 --> 19:02.516
and having intercourse
in your restroom.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.642
No, no. In a place like this,

19:03.642 --> 19:06.061
- you want it to feel exclusive.
- Yeah, absolutely.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.856
I just remembered, actually,
there might be a waitlist.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.983
So, if you wanted
to put us down--

19:10.983 --> 19:12.568
Just in case something were
to open up.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.403
Last-minute cancellation.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.155
- Yeah, it happens. You--
- You never know.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.116
- Yeah, you never know.
- Right.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.870
All right. How about this?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.081
I'm gonna use the
other bathroom.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.292
Yeah, the one where
your roommate isn't having sex.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.294
And then maybe by the
time I'm done, they'll be done

19:30.294 --> 19:32.212
and you and I could
grab a drink?

19:33.505 --> 19:35.841
I'm here with some
colleagues, um.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.343
It's a table full of suits.
Ya can't miss us.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.638
Perfect.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.739
- Marta?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.368
Just about how long-ish

20:03.368 --> 20:04.411
do you think you're gonna be?

20:04.411 --> 20:05.913
Oh, my God!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.540
Shots, shots, shots!

20:08.540 --> 20:11.210
Get in here, Jimmy.
You, too, random chick.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.503
Oh, it's, it's Lindsay.
I-I'm enjoying my Cosmo--

20:13.503 --> 20:15.672
- Get in there, Lindsay.
- Yes. Okay.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.639
- Ahh. Ah.
- It burns so sweet.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.474
Jimmy, random Lindsay.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.018
- Another round.
- Uh, a-- We're good, actually.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.603
- Yeah, one more.
- It's--

20:29.853 --> 20:31.563
I'm just gonna sleep a little.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.274
If I start screaming,
it's totally normal.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.073
Sorry, we had a pretty major
breakthrough at work today,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.741
so... we're celebrating.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.826
Oh... Where do you work?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.996
Uh, Winnicott Douglass.
The investment bank.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.706
Fancy.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.416
Very fancy.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.960
Usually, I'm walking
around with a monocle.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
- Hm.
Yeah.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.383
So, what's it like?
Investment banking.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.219
- It's intense.
Hmm.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.428
It's competitive.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.598
That's what I like about it,
though, you know?

21:06.598 --> 21:07.891
It's all on you.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.603
If you don't kill, you don't eat.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.021
Mm, I hear that.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.315
Yeah. What about you?
What do you do?

21:16.441 --> 21:19.152
Uh... I'm a writer.

21:20.153 --> 21:20.988
Really?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.156
What kind of writing?

21:23.824 --> 21:29.454
Fiction... Novels, mainly.
I'm a... novelist.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.331
Yeah, are you familiar
with the Weekly, uh,

21:31.331 --> 21:33.417
the Weetly Prize?

21:33.875 --> 21:36.378
I don't think I've ever actually met

21:36.378 --> 21:38.422
a real-life novelist before.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.925
Well... here I am.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.012
- Leather pants and all.
- Plastic.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.346
Forgive me.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.057
- We'll see.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.309
Ew!

21:50.309 --> 21:51.560
I'm okay.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.228
- Do you wanna get outta here?

21:53.228 --> 21:54.313
I know a place.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.897
- Yes, I do.
Okay.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.867
Whoa.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.202
You work here?

22:09.911 --> 22:12.539
- Yeah.
- Oh... wow.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.251
Is that the Brooklyn Bridge?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.212
That's it.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.090
Wow. You wonder h-how did
they even...

22:22.090 --> 22:24.259
build something like that?

22:25.260 --> 22:26.261
Well,

22:31.224 --> 22:33.226
it took 14 years.

22:33.977 --> 22:34.811
Yeah.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.605
It was the longest
suspension bridge

22:36.605 --> 22:38.106
in the world when it opened.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.030
Are you some kind of...
amateur bridge historian

22:45.030 --> 22:50.619
or... is this all part
of your seduction protocol?

22:52.704 --> 22:53.914
Can't it be both?

22:58.043 --> 22:59.461
What else do you know?

23:01.630 --> 23:03.632
- About the Brooklyn Bridge?
- Hm.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.637
It wasn't officially named
that until 1915.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.973
- Fascinating.
- Mm-hm.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.725
What else?

23:15.477 --> 23:17.104
The guy who designed it,

23:17.562 --> 23:19.189
when he went to pick
out the spot for it,

23:19.189 --> 23:20.565
he was standing on a dock.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.818
A boat came,

23:23.944 --> 23:25.362
crushed his foot.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.989
He had to have his
toes amputated.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.993
Why would you tell me that?

23:31.993 --> 23:34.037
- You asked me what else I knew.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.414
Poor, poor man.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.749
Well, then, after
the amputation,

23:37.749 --> 23:41.128
he insisted on this thing
called water therapy.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.212
Did it work?

23:43.088 --> 23:45.424
Oh, no. He, he died
a few weeks later

23:45.424 --> 23:48.718
- from the infection.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.887
I'm sorry. I d--
I don't know why I'm--

23:50.887 --> 23:53.223
- I don't either. It's, um--
- It's-- (laughs) It is not funny.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.642
- No, it's really not.
- It is horrible.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.145
- It's terrible.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.069
Where'd you go?

24:07.571 --> 24:08.780
No, I was just--

24:11.950 --> 24:12.784
Nowhere.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.373
You don't have to listen
to them, you know?

24:20.167 --> 24:21.376
Listen to who?

24:21.793 --> 24:26.006
All the... noise...
in your head.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.302
I've started to realize recently

24:30.302 --> 24:34.347
it's... not always the truth.

24:37.767 --> 24:41.062
Never mind. Sorry.
I don't know... what I'm saying.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.607
I'm just--
Just ignore me.

24:43.607 --> 24:48.528
I-- I'm just really drunk,
so, yeah, sorry.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.030
Sure, yeah.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.416
Actually,

25:02.667 --> 25:06.296
I'm not... drunk... at all.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.592
And, and I am trying
to apologize less

25:10.592 --> 25:12.802
and say what I want more.

25:12.802 --> 25:17.933
And... right now what I really
want is to kiss you.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.227
So,

25:21.937 --> 25:23.605
would that be okay?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.610
Yes.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.404
That would be--

25:35.283 --> 25:36.159
Yeah.

26:39.973 --> 26:43.184
- Plastic really doesn't stretch, does it?

26:43.184 --> 26:46.104
- These things can't be comfortable.
- They're really not.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.650
Oh... yeah.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.201
Oh, my God... Oh.

27:00.827 --> 27:01.661
God.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.957
Oh. Oh.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.585
Oh God.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.300
Oh, my God.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.802
Oh... Oh, my God.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.221
Oh, my God.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.479
Shit.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.149
Um.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.155
I, I should go. Um, this was--

27:46.956 --> 27:48.166
I'm sorry.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.141
Be honest...

28:05.725 --> 28:07.602
How hard were you pulling it?

28:28.581 --> 28:31.334
- What the fuck was that?
- She did it on purpose.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.878
- You're such a little bitch.
- Talking about noises in your head.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.380
You were right there.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.757
What kind of sick mind games
is she playing with my baby?

28:37.757 --> 28:39.175
- You're weak.
- You're pathetic.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.886
- You're perfect.
- Shut up.
