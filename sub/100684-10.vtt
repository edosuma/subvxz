00:03.133 --> 00:04.961
What are you...
What are you do...

00:05.005 --> 00:06.267
Wait.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.964
You're out?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.618
How did this happen?

00:09.661 --> 00:11.402
Overcrowding, I guess.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.320
Oh.
[chuckles]Hi. Hi.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.061
That's good.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.150
That's good.

00:20.194 --> 00:23.110
Um... Sorry.
Just, like, wasn't...

00:23.153 --> 00:24.981
I'm... I guess I'm justkind of, like, surprised.Mmm.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.505
It's-it's okay.Um...

00:27.549 --> 00:30.552
Do you want to come in? Yeah.Um, yeah.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.684
[door unlocks]

00:35.252 --> 00:36.558
And what happens
if she doesn't admit

00:36.601 --> 00:38.038
to trafficking drugs for Nia?

00:38.081 --> 00:39.909
She will.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.911
MURPHY:
How long were you waiting?

00:41.954 --> 00:44.218
I don't know.A couple hours.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.611
Were you working or...?

00:47.612 --> 00:50.224
Um, no.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.834
Murph, it's-it's fine.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.575
Seriously.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.011
I didn't expect you

00:55.055 --> 00:56.534
to stop hooking upwith random guys.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.278
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.369
Okay.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.808
[door closes]

01:27.652 --> 01:29.654
â™ª

01:36.661 --> 01:39.969
Do you want something
to drink or eat?

01:40.012 --> 01:42.276
I think I have leftover Chinesein the fridge.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.278
I'll just grab some water.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.627
I can get it for you.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.673
I remember where
everything is.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.728
[liquid pouring]

01:59.771 --> 02:00.903
[clatters]

02:00.946 --> 02:02.557
MURPHY:
When'd you get out?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.254
MAX:
Today.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.604
Came straight here.

02:06.648 --> 02:09.607
That's sweet.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.957
Where's Jess?

02:12.001 --> 02:14.264
Um, I don't know, actually.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.614
Um...

02:16.658 --> 02:19.617
Nia...

02:19.661 --> 02:21.706
It... Well, it doesn't matter.
She's just gone.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.317
But I don't want
to talk about it.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.753
Well, what did Nia do?

02:24.796 --> 02:26.711
I just really don't wantto talk about it.

02:26.755 --> 02:29.105
Okay. Sorry.

02:30.759 --> 02:33.283
It's fine. Justthe whole situation, like...

02:34.328 --> 02:36.504
Just not really okay.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.201
[sniffles]

02:38.245 --> 02:40.203
Yeah, I bet.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.553
"Yeah, I bet"?

02:42.597 --> 02:44.120
What?

02:44.164 --> 02:47.167
I say I'm not okay,
and you say, "Yeah, I bet."

02:47.210 --> 02:49.865
You said you didn't want
to talk about it, so...

02:52.128 --> 02:54.783
[sighs]

02:54.826 --> 02:56.611
Look, hey.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.961
Hey, it's o...
it's okay.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.572
It's all right.[sniffles]

03:04.923 --> 03:06.708
Jess hasn't even called me.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.232
She just ran,
and she left some...

03:09.276 --> 03:10.886
like, dumb note.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.803
And just after everything,
it just sucks.

03:15.804 --> 03:19.155
Like, "everything"
meaning Nia?

03:20.809 --> 03:22.419
What?

03:22.463 --> 03:24.421
I'm just...

03:24.465 --> 03:27.119
Is that why you guys got
into a fight? Nia Bailey.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.078
Why do you keep-- why do you
keep talking about Nia?I'm not.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.558
I-I...

03:30.601 --> 03:32.908
It isyour work.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.649
You're being so weird.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.738
No, I'm not.Yeah, you are.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
Look, I'm...

03:38.435 --> 03:41.482
I'm sorry I'm
being weird.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.441
Okay? I guess...

03:44.485 --> 03:47.314
Guess prison changed me.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.665
Prison changed you?

03:50.708 --> 03:53.145
I regretted that sentence the
moment it came out of my mouth.[laughs]

03:53.189 --> 03:54.799
[laughs]:
I-I... I don't...

03:54.843 --> 03:56.497
Don't know why
I said that.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.020
[groans]

03:58.063 --> 03:59.500
You look good.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.849
Shut up.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.851
No, I'm serious.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.157
Guess a life of crime suits you.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.812
Well, yeah.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.250
I'm not gonna be in it
for very much longer.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.252
So...

04:12.295 --> 04:14.602
What do you mean?

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
We're giving everything

04:16.343 --> 04:18.780
we have to someone else,
to this dude Josiah.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.260
So...

04:20.303 --> 04:22.305
Anyway, it's done.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.612
But...What?

04:24.655 --> 04:26.962
Hang on. Hang on. Wait.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.181
Are you s... are you saying
that Nia's making you

04:29.225 --> 04:30.966
keep her product at
Guiding Hope? Is...

04:31.009 --> 04:33.011
Um...

04:34.535 --> 04:36.363
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is she stashing it, too?

04:36.406 --> 04:38.278
It sounds like it.

04:42.543 --> 04:45.241
Look, I wasn't honestearlier. [sniffles]

04:46.547 --> 04:48.549
About what?

04:50.028 --> 04:52.988
The guy from last night.It's just...

04:56.034 --> 04:58.298
He's not random.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.389
Just tell me.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.740
His name's Josh.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.700
Um...

05:09.744 --> 05:12.224
And it's just, like,
not that random.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.878
So...

05:13.922 --> 05:16.054
No, no, no, no. Bring it back
to Nia. Bring it back to Nia.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.056
MURPHY: All I wanted was
for you to be out.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.928
You know?And I still do, so...

05:21.669 --> 05:23.714
I'm just, like, really confused.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.063
I don't know.I didn't think...

05:25.107 --> 05:27.109
I didn't--I don't know. I...

05:33.550 --> 05:35.509
Please say something.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.252
Um, I just...

05:40.296 --> 05:42.254
I know.
[sniffles]

05:42.298 --> 05:44.256
I know.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.520
Um...

05:46.563 --> 05:47.869
I still don't get

05:47.912 --> 05:50.132
how you started
trafficking drugs for Nia.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.006
W-What?

05:55.050 --> 05:56.747
Oh, no.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.009
MURPHY:
I just basically told you

05:58.053 --> 05:59.837
I have feelings
for someone else.

05:59.881 --> 06:02.362
What is going on?

06:02.405 --> 06:03.754
What? We're together.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.104
We're, like, actually togetherfor the first time

06:06.148 --> 06:07.584
in a long time,

06:07.628 --> 06:10.979
and all you care aboutis how I got involved with...

06:22.556 --> 06:24.514
How did you say
you got out of prison?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.561
MAX:
Overcrowding.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.608
MURPHY: How many other people
were released?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.436
I don't know.What's going on, Max?

06:33.480 --> 06:34.872
Nothing.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.442
What are you doing? Just...

06:39.486 --> 06:42.924
Trying to find it.S-Stop.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.537
Murphy, stop!

06:50.410 --> 06:52.368
Hey, Dean. What's up?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.327
[exhales]

06:55.371 --> 06:58.418
Just let me-- Let me just--
Let me explain. Murphy.I'm so done with you. Get out.

06:58.461 --> 06:59.984
Stop. Stop!Get out.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.638
Get out!

07:26.707 --> 07:29.318
[clears throat]
What do you think?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.189
I don't know. I'm just

07:31.233 --> 07:33.191
hoping we got enough to get a
warrant to search Guiding Hope.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.932
Yeah, me, too.All right, listen,

07:34.976 --> 07:36.891
I'm gonna call the chief, tell
him to meet me right away.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.458
You got to get over
to Guiding Hope.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.850
Murphy and Felix are
definitely gonna try

07:39.894 --> 07:41.330
and move the drugs out.
Don't let them.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.984
Right.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.508
What if I don't see themdo anything illegal?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.162
Like, how can Ijust pull them over?

07:47.205 --> 07:49.077
Make something up.[stammers]

07:49.120 --> 07:50.861
Broken taillight. They ran
a stop sign. Anything.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.384
Got it. Okay.Just go.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
Here.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.660
Thanks.Thanks?

08:06.703 --> 08:08.531
Dude, she knows I
was recording her.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
Yeah, well,you weren't exactly smooth.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.187
[scoffs]

08:12.230 --> 08:14.537
We're still good, though?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.539
She still has her
immunity, right?Yes.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.106
Max, for the millionth time,
we're good.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.716
Look, I got to go, okay?
Thank you.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.196
Yeah.[engine starts]

08:21.239 --> 08:23.241
Yeah.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.910
Murphy, come on. Open the door.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.045
Please talk to me.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.960
I'll explain everything
if you open the door.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.485
[doorknob jiggles]

08:58.494 --> 09:00.322
Murph, I'm sorry. I just...

09:00.365 --> 09:02.193
I really need to talk
to you, okay?

09:03.238 --> 09:05.066
Murphy?

09:18.340 --> 09:19.602
MAX: Let me just--
Let me explain. Murphy.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.951
MURPHY:
I'm so done with you. Get out.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.170
MAX: Stop. Stop!MURPHY: Get out.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.868
Get out!

09:24.912 --> 09:27.915
You dragged me out of bed
for this?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.701
She admits nothing.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.311
That's not true. She
alludes to having

09:33.355 --> 09:35.662
Nia Bailey's drugs.Alludes?

09:35.705 --> 09:37.664
If you just listen again...You promised me

09:37.707 --> 09:39.013
Nia Bailey.
You haven't delivered her.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.710
And on top of everything,
I told you to drop

09:40.754 --> 09:43.321
the whole Murphy Mason angle,
and you didn't.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.845
Dean,

09:44.888 --> 09:46.542
you're done.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.805
N-No. No. No.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.807
No, trust me on this.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.853
If you just give me a
warrant, we can search...

09:52.896 --> 09:54.550
You're not hearing me.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.857
I put my ass
on the line for you,

09:56.900 --> 09:58.206
and for what?

09:58.249 --> 10:00.208
Nothing.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.601
You're done. You're fired.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.994
Clean out your desk.
Hand in your gun and badge.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.648
[exhales]
But, sir...Dean.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.694
This is nota discussion. I said

10:07.737 --> 10:09.478
clean out your desk.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.219
Now.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.398
Okay.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.547
[quiet laugh]

10:35.591 --> 10:37.898
There's the poop kid.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
[phone vibrating]

10:54.654 --> 10:55.698
Yeah?

10:55.742 --> 10:57.134
Hey, you got that warrant yet?

10:57.178 --> 10:59.223
Felix Bell and Murphy Mason
just got here.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.922
Uh, it's over.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.142
What-what-what do you mean?

11:05.186 --> 11:07.579
I didn't get the warrant.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.016
In fact, I just...

11:09.059 --> 11:10.495
I got let go.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.888
"Let go"?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.673
What, like, fired?

11:13.716 --> 11:15.326
Yeah.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.328
What a load of crap.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.895
Well, it is what it is.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.680
No, this is not okay.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.072
I mean, sure,
some things haven't

11:22.116 --> 11:23.595
gone our way
with the Bailey case,

11:23.639 --> 11:25.075
but that's no fault of yours.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.076
Gene...

11:26.120 --> 11:27.338
Look, man...

11:27.382 --> 11:28.862
not for nothing, but you're

11:28.905 --> 11:30.428
the best damn cop I've ever met.

11:30.472 --> 11:34.519
A stand-up guy,
a-a bomb-ass father, and...

11:34.563 --> 11:37.348
you know, a pretty good
friend to me.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.089
Well, thank you.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.091
Look, I'm gonna sit here, I'm
gonna catch these kids moving

11:41.135 --> 11:43.572
these drugs, provingto the chief that you're right,

11:43.615 --> 11:44.747
and get you your job back.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.010
They can't wait
in there forever.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.883
I don't think
I'm getting my job back.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.625
Well, I got to try.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.890
I'll see you later, Gene.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.726
Okay, so, any minute now,

12:06.769 --> 12:09.293
the cops are gonna search
this place and find

12:09.337 --> 12:11.382
all the heroin ever!

12:11.426 --> 12:13.123
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.646
I want to punch
Max in the face!

12:14.690 --> 12:15.996
I'm gonna tie him to a chair--

12:16.039 --> 12:17.780
Okay, Felix, we need to focus!

12:17.824 --> 12:20.130
Stop, we just needto get Josiah

12:20.174 --> 12:21.305
to pick up everything,like, right now.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.525
Josiah.But he

12:23.568 --> 12:25.745
gave me his number, though.
So maybe I'll just call him?

12:25.788 --> 12:26.963
I'm gonna call him.Okay.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.138
Okay?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
Call Josiah.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.838
[phone ringing]

12:41.369 --> 12:42.587
Yes?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.764
Hey, it's Murphy.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
Who?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.984
Murphy Mason.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.551
Uh, you were supposed
to pick up some stuff

12:49.594 --> 12:51.205
from me tomorrow,but there's been a change

12:51.248 --> 12:52.859
in plans, and I need youto pick it up from me,

12:52.902 --> 12:55.557
Now.um... now.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.341
Now?

12:57.385 --> 12:59.387
Yes.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.130
You can bring it to me.

13:03.173 --> 13:06.873
Um... that was not partof the deal, so...

13:06.916 --> 13:08.657
I said tomorrow.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.746
I can't get a crew together
this last minute.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.357
You want it out,
get it out yourself,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.359
and bring it to me.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.057
Call me when you're on your way.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.362
I'll tell you where
to meet my guys.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.755
Okay.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.843
What?

13:22.453 --> 13:23.977
Murphy!Felix...

13:24.020 --> 13:25.239
That's not okay...

13:25.282 --> 13:26.631
There are cameras
down there!

13:26.675 --> 13:28.068
A lot of cameras!

13:28.111 --> 13:29.634
Which is why Josiah
was gonna bring a crew

13:29.678 --> 13:30.766
with, like, tech
guys and stuff.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.072
Can you justshut the power off?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.900
No, you cannot just
shut the power off.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.250
I guarantee you Nia has someone
constantly watching that.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.252
Well, then what werethe tech guys gonna do?

13:38.295 --> 13:40.210
I don't know, probably loop
a few minutes of the basement

13:40.254 --> 13:41.908
being empty while
they cleared it out.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.039
That's a thing?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.867
Have you not seen Speed?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.174
Oh, my God.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.437
Wait, hang on.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.700
Let me see if I
can try and do it.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.442
Pop quiz, hotshot.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.359
Okay, Nia's guys leftthe default login credentials,

13:58.402 --> 14:00.274
meaning we'reon the same network,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.711
so I can use an addressresolution protocol poisoning

14:02.754 --> 14:04.756
to fool the FTP server.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.237
Right, I was also
gonna suggest that.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.197
Okay, when I hit play

14:10.240 --> 14:12.242
on this looped footage,
we should be good to go.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.375
Okay, I need you
to go to the basement,

14:14.418 --> 14:16.507
walk in front of the drugs,
see if this worked.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.381
Just walk? Just walk?

14:20.424 --> 14:21.904
Straight.Okay...

14:21.948 --> 14:24.428
End of the fence,left, first door.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.822
Don't fall down the stairs.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.442
So?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.618
Worked.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.619
Really?

14:41.663 --> 14:42.794
Yeah.

14:42.838 --> 14:43.970
Come on.

14:44.013 --> 14:44.709
Let's go.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.276
We don't have much time.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.242
Okay, go.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.649
[slurps]

15:14.217 --> 15:15.871
I've lapped you
so many times.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.525
I'm sorry.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
I'm going as fastas I possibly can.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.789
Just hurry, okay?I'm trying.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.673
[groans]

15:47.511 --> 15:49.470
[knocking]

15:49.513 --> 15:50.993
Who is that?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.777
The cops?I don't know.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.127
Hang on.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.130
[knocking continues]

16:00.611 --> 16:03.092
Hey. The lady does
not wish to see you.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.746
And, quite frankly,
neither do I.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.053
Open the door!

16:07.096 --> 16:08.097
No! I-- If I were you...

16:08.141 --> 16:10.143
[loud rattling]Okay.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.232
What? What? What?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.234
Hey!Murphy!

16:14.277 --> 16:15.452
You've got a lot

16:15.496 --> 16:17.019
of nerve, man, coming here.Murphy, look,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.238
I need to explaineverything.

16:18.281 --> 16:21.067
Oh, my God.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.503
Yeah.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.939
As you can see,
we're a little busy

16:23.983 --> 16:26.420
cleaning up the mess
that yougot us in.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.987
Mm-hmm.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.990
There's a cop outside.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.039
Oh, God. That cop is literallythere to make sure we don't move

16:37.083 --> 16:39.781
the drugs. They're probably just
waiting for a warrant, so...

16:39.824 --> 16:42.653
we're toast! We're toast!Stop it.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.264
We just need to figure out
a way to get everything

16:44.307 --> 16:46.527
out of here
a little more discreetly.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.094
Cool. Sounds good.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.530
Why-why is thereso much heroin here?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.140
Why are youhere?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.142
Go. I d-- I don't--
I can't even be around you.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.317
FELIX:Okay, I haveto figure out

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
where we're gonna hide this.Murphy.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.799
Don't. Stop.Just lis-listen to me.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.801
You have immunity.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.716
I don't know
what that means.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.197
Dean found the drugsin Chloe's cane.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.546
He had pictures of it.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.069
He was gonna put you awayfor years

17:07.113 --> 17:09.593
unless you could incriminateNia, which you did.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.942
So you're good.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
Oh, I'm good? I'm good?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.076
Thank you so much.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.122
He had evidence, Murphy.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.732
What was I supposed to do?

17:17.775 --> 17:20.735
I don't know.
The opposite of what you did.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.953
I only did this because I knew

17:21.997 --> 17:23.564
you would never workfor Dean yourself.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.914
Yeah. You're right.Cool.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.221
So I was just supposed to letyou go to prison for years?

17:28.264 --> 17:30.092
No, I had it handled.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.441
I had it figured out.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.660
We were gonna get out.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.663
We were gonna get
out in 24 hours.

17:35.706 --> 17:39.101
But you ruined...
everything.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
You ruined it.I was trying to help!

17:41.147 --> 17:43.410
MURPHY:
I don't need your help.Oh, my God!

17:43.453 --> 17:45.760
Yeah, okay, I-- Yeah,
I know. I know that.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.805
You don't need anybody's
help. I get it. Okay?I had it handled.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.590
MAX: You're impossible.I had it handled.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.592
MAX: Yeah. Clearly,
you had it handled.I did.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.117
Just get out. Just-just
get out of here.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.772
I love that you're allowedto save me whenever you want,

17:57.815 --> 18:01.036
but God forbid I tryto do one th...Holy crap.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.735
Ben?

18:04.779 --> 18:07.129
Yeah. Hey.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.696
What are you
doing here?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.915
I thought you guyswere just slinging dime bags.

18:10.959 --> 18:14.223
But that's-that's impressive.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.659
Who is this person?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.531
I'm the
receptionist.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.663
How do you do?

18:19.707 --> 18:22.710
I got to take a leak.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.104
It's fine.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.409
He knows everything
that's happening.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.498
Murphy, you needto listen to me.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.326
You're not gonna doany prison time.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.024
I don't believe a word that
comes out of Dean's mouth.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.330
Yeah, me neither.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.289
That's why I had himput it in writing.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.769
Did you get
immunity for Felix?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.163
Can Felix
just walk away?

18:41.207 --> 18:44.035
Or am I supposed to leave
him with all this?

18:44.079 --> 18:45.689
'Cause I'm not gonna do that.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.343
So, if you'll excuse me,

18:47.387 --> 18:49.215
I'm in the middle
of something.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.956
Let me at least help you.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.610
I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.046
[door closes]FELIX:Actually,

18:55.090 --> 18:56.178
I sort of do.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.701
We need to drag up, like,

18:57.745 --> 18:58.920
a bunch more of these.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.574
[sighs]

19:04.665 --> 19:06.667
[alarm beeps]

19:19.419 --> 19:21.160
[sighs]

19:31.735 --> 19:32.693
What's going on?

19:32.736 --> 19:33.868
I forgot something
on my desk.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.044
Picture of my daughter.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.046
Take care of yourself, Dean.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.048
Will do!

19:50.537 --> 19:52.234
[rattling]

20:07.771 --> 20:09.382
All right.Let's load 'em.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.949
Truck's out front, okay?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.995
[strained]:
Okay.

20:15.953 --> 20:16.911
[grunts]

20:16.954 --> 20:18.217
Okay.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.097
[knocking]

20:34.494 --> 20:36.496
[exhales]

20:38.280 --> 20:40.239
[sighs]

20:44.112 --> 20:46.157
Long time no see.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.160
Come in.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.825
What do you want?

21:01.869 --> 21:05.307
I think it's more
about what youwant.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
Oh, I think I was very clearwhere I stood with you.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.530
So, you call me in the middle ofthe night demanding a meeting.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.661
Just get to the point.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.143
The DEA is closing in,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
as are the IRS
and Chicago PD.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.321
Mm-hmm.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.714
I also happen to know

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
that you moved the warehouse
deal to Guiding Hope.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.457
All right, well, you obviously
ain't got a warrant.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.154
Otherwise, you would have
already raided it.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.156
That is true.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.768
I was fired
when I even brought it up.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.901
Seems like you don't understandthe concept of leverage.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.990
Hmm.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.340
Stole everything
the Feds have on you,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.647
took the liberty of printing upa small sample.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.302
The rest is encrypted
on a USB drive.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.227
These are my private books.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.230
Phone conversations.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.928
Nia...

22:00.971 --> 22:03.496
they are going
to get you.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.802
With this, you'll know exactly
what you have to move,

22:05.846 --> 22:08.152
what you have to shut down
before it's too late.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.243
And what do you get in return?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.771
A cut of the shipment. 20%.

22:17.814 --> 22:21.905
Five, and you know I don'tnegotiate, so don't even try me.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.213
Oh, uh, one more thing.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.737
You, uh, might want to
move all your heroin.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.699
You said no one was on to it.

22:32.742 --> 22:36.093
No... not because of the cops.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.706
MAX: Guess the life
of crime suits you.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.797
MURPHY:Well, yeah. I'm not gonna be init for very much longer, so...

22:43.840 --> 22:45.886
MAX:
What do you mean?

22:45.929 --> 22:48.410
MURPHY:
We're giving everything
we have to someone else,

22:48.454 --> 22:52.545
to this dude Josiah,
so... anyway, it's done.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.808
Murphy is at Guiding
Hope right now.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.419
I think she's planning
to move it to him tonight.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.208
I'm gonnakill that bitch.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.647
You go find
every guy we got,

23:07.690 --> 23:09.431
and you get 'em
over to Guiding Hope.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.085
I want my stashout of there tonight.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.304
And where the hell is Sam?
Get her over there, too.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.092
I'll call you as soonas I get everything back,

23:18.135 --> 23:19.615
and I'll give you your piece.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.705
Sounds good.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.100
Wait, wait.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.754
Are there gonna be
any cops there?

23:27.797 --> 23:31.279
Only my partner, but
he's working rogue.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.020
Can my guys take him?

23:33.063 --> 23:35.065
[sighs]

23:36.066 --> 23:38.068
Yeah.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.169
[panting]

24:07.402 --> 24:09.448
[engine starts]

24:12.146 --> 24:14.278
That's so dumb.

24:24.724 --> 24:25.899
[siren wailing]

24:25.942 --> 24:27.466
[engine starts]

24:32.819 --> 24:34.864
He's pulling us over.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.215
MURPHY:What? What do we do?

24:38.259 --> 24:39.521
We got to stall.
Keep driving.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.480
Keep driving?Just do what he says.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.699
[sighs][line ringing]

24:43.743 --> 24:46.093
WOMAN:
911. What's your emergency?

24:46.136 --> 24:49.879
Hi. Um, I'm in the
vehicle with some

24:49.923 --> 24:52.621
associates,
and we are being pulled over

24:52.665 --> 24:55.798
by an unmarked vehicle,uh, but we haven't

24:55.842 --> 24:57.887
broken any laws,
driving the speed limit,

24:57.931 --> 25:00.760
so, just want to make sure
that this is a real cop,

25:00.803 --> 25:05.025
you know, because we don't
um, feel... very safe.

25:05.068 --> 25:08.202
Okay, what is the license platenumber of the vehicle?

25:08.245 --> 25:11.031
Absolutely. Uh,
license plate number.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.381
WOMAN:
Hi. This is dispatch.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.383
Can you confirm
you're pulling someone over

25:15.426 --> 25:17.037
at Sycamore Street
and Partridge Avenue?

25:17.080 --> 25:19.996
I am.
It's a dog grooming vehicle.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.521
The license plate's
Papa, Sierra, Eight,

25:22.564 --> 25:24.871
Five, Kilo, Three, Eight.

25:24.914 --> 25:27.787
And what is your reason
for stopping them?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.879
Broken taillight.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.489
Got it.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.405
The driver will pull over when
he reaches a safer location.

25:37.448 --> 25:38.885
Safer location?

25:38.928 --> 25:40.190
You see what you just said?

25:40.234 --> 25:41.714
I'm at Sycamore Street
and Partridge Avenue.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.760
Ain't nothing going down
at Partridge and Sycamore.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.415
It's me.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.591
It's gone, all of it.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.941
How? I got a guy
watching the cameras.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.814
They must have hacked into it.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.250
And the cop?

25:56.293 --> 25:57.773
He wasn't here, either.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.732
Fan out. Find Murphy.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.124
She got to be
in that stupid-ass truck.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.299
She can't be that hard to find.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.519
On it. Go on.

26:06.521 --> 26:07.914
FELIX:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

26:07.957 --> 26:08.915
MURPHY:Max!

26:08.958 --> 26:10.525
MAX:
Look, I have to pull over.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.571
[siren wailing]

26:14.660 --> 26:16.618
[siren stops]

26:41.948 --> 26:43.514
Mr. Parish.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.429
Good to see youagain, man.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.649
Could you open up the back
for me, please?

26:47.693 --> 26:50.347
May I ask why?

26:50.391 --> 26:52.088
There's the poop kid.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.003
Got the whole gang here, huh?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.788
Open the back.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.754
Go on, step back.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.409
Nothing back here.
Just some dog food.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.628
Dog food, huh?

27:31.432 --> 27:33.434
Where is it?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.672
â™ª

28:05.727 --> 28:07.033
Is he gone?

28:07.076 --> 28:08.338
He just drove off.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.688
Thank God. Okay.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.864
Um, Felix, text Josiah,tell him we're on our way.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.953
Got it.Ben should be thereany minute.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.781
I'm just gonna calland see where he is.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.521
Call Ben.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.132
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Calling Ben.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.786
[phone vibrating]

28:20.829 --> 28:22.962
Hi, Murphy.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.965
Hey. Uh, did you...did you make it out okay?

28:26.008 --> 28:27.749
Did anyone follow you?

28:28.837 --> 28:30.143
Yeah, I made it out.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.710
No one followed me.
All good.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.321
Great. Okay, um,

28:34.364 --> 28:36.671
we're gonna be at the arcade
in, like, 20 minutes,

28:36.715 --> 28:38.368
so we'll meet you there.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.675
Oh, I didn't go to the arcade.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.808
I took the drugs somewhere else.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.810
Yeah, I hid 'em pretty good.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.681
What?What?

28:46.725 --> 28:50.816
Yeah, what you guys gave me
is worth a lot.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.993
Like, millions
and millions of dollars.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.690
So...

28:55.734 --> 28:57.605
yeah, I was thinking,
I don't think

28:57.648 --> 29:00.347
three grand is gonna cut it
for me.

29:00.390 --> 29:03.263
MURPHY:Okay. Okay, Ben? Ben,

29:03.306 --> 29:05.918
I-I need you to listen to me.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.398
We're dealing with someone

29:08.442 --> 29:11.140
extremely dangerous, okay?

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
This is not a game, Ben.

29:12.881 --> 29:13.969
Yeah, I know. It's actually

29:14.013 --> 29:14.796
pretty simple.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.842
Whoever's drugs these are,

29:16.885 --> 29:18.539
tell them I want...

29:18.582 --> 29:22.151
five... hundred grand.

29:26.112 --> 29:28.288
Fine. Fine.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.420
What?!Shh. Felix.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.728
Ben, I need you

29:33.772 --> 29:35.295
to tell me where they are.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.862
Money first.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.385
I'm at The Linsmore.

29:38.428 --> 29:41.388
It's, like, 4:00 in the morning.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.433
I have Chelsea's keys.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.396
[sighs]

29:49.439 --> 29:51.920
What are we gonna do?

29:51.964 --> 29:53.400
It's fine.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.446
It's... fine?

29:56.490 --> 29:59.232
I don't think it's fine!
What, are you gonna just

29:59.275 --> 30:03.714
explain to Josiah
that he has to give $500,000

30:03.758 --> 30:05.542
to our psycho receptionist?

30:05.586 --> 30:06.456
If you hadn't

30:06.500 --> 30:08.850
sent the drugs with Ben alone...

30:08.894 --> 30:11.287
Me?!...we would not bein this situation.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.811
FELIX:What was I supposed to do?

30:12.854 --> 30:14.116
MURPHY:I cannot believe I listened

30:14.160 --> 30:16.510
to your stupid idea!Ben

30:16.553 --> 30:18.294
was the only one
the cops wouldn't follow.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.862
If one of us went with him,
they would have followed us

30:20.906 --> 30:22.472
or called for a backup car,
okay?

30:22.516 --> 30:24.300
And in my defense,
the plan worked.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.432
It did not work, Felix!

30:25.475 --> 30:26.999
It worked!No, it didn't!

30:27.042 --> 30:30.567
Some drug addict is holding
Josiah's heroin ransom!

30:30.611 --> 30:32.134
It did not work!

30:32.178 --> 30:35.834
Well, technically, it's still
Nia's heroin at this point.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.532
I voted
for burning down Guiding Hope.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.100
No one asked you!Say that again, huh?

30:41.143 --> 30:44.146
And Felix and I decidedthat you don't get a vote

30:44.190 --> 30:45.452
because the only reason

30:45.495 --> 30:47.671
we're in this situationis because of you!

30:47.715 --> 30:49.673
[chuckles]:
Be... Because of me?

30:49.717 --> 30:51.762
Yeah.You guys wouldn't even
be working for Nia

30:51.806 --> 30:54.156
if Felix didn't steal my money.FELIX: Oh!

30:54.200 --> 30:56.115
You want to go back
that far, Max?Yeah, I want

30:56.158 --> 30:57.420
to go back that far,
because that

30:57.464 --> 30:58.987
is how this whole thing started.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.250
Shut up, Max!Is that how you talk
to your new boyfriend?

31:01.294 --> 31:02.469
[gunshot]Ah!

31:04.210 --> 31:06.168
What the hell was that?

31:06.212 --> 31:07.300
[horn honking]

31:07.343 --> 31:09.302
It's one of Nia's guys.
Oh, man.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.224
[tires screeching]

31:22.576 --> 31:23.707
[groans, pants]

31:23.751 --> 31:25.274
You guys okay?

31:25.318 --> 31:27.276
I think so.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.930
I'm good.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.366
We need to run.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.299
Oh.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.866
Hello again.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.999
Where'd you put them?

31:54.042 --> 31:55.696
MURPHY:We're-we're...

31:55.739 --> 31:59.526
we're having a little bit
of a situation.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.441
Don't. Stop.Okay?

32:01.484 --> 32:03.922
The cops were on to us,
so we had to move them.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.185
Nia knows you were trying
to hand them over to Josiah.

32:06.228 --> 32:07.882
So just tell me where they are.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.536
We don't know right now.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.059
Murphy...We don't know.

32:11.103 --> 32:15.368
We gave them to someonewho's hiding them.

32:15.411 --> 32:16.978
He's trying to extort us.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.545
He's tryingto extort Nia.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.592
And he'svery unpredictable,

32:22.636 --> 32:25.856
and I don't knowwhat he's planningon doing with the drugs.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.556
I don't.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.994
But if you want meto find them...

32:33.038 --> 32:35.301
I have to talk to him.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.086
Where is he?

32:38.130 --> 32:41.263
Well, if I tell you that,you'll just kill me.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.224
I'm not stupid.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.317
If you kill me...

32:51.360 --> 32:55.756
you'll lose any chance of
getting the drugs back to Nia.

32:57.279 --> 33:00.108
You really want
to explain that to her?

33:06.375 --> 33:08.421
We're gonna get
in my truck,

33:08.464 --> 33:11.772
you're gonna take
me to this guy.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.818
No sudden moves.
You got it?

33:17.082 --> 33:19.084
Okay.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.621
You're gonna drive.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.624

this guy at?

â™ª Yeah â™ª Yeahâ™ª

36:23.616 --> 36:26.488
â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.â™ª

36:35.018 --> 36:38.457
Ben? Ben! Benjamin.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.762
Benjamin!

36:39.806 --> 36:41.242
Check his pulse.I am.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.113
What's going on?

36:43.157 --> 36:45.290
What's going on, Felix?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.595
He's dead.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.162
MURPHY:
What?!

36:48.206 --> 36:51.165
What do you mean?FELIX:
He's dead.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.257
I think he OD'd.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.433
Oh, my God.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.348
â™ª Spare a little candle

37:00.392 --> 37:03.830
â™ª Save some light for me

37:03.873 --> 37:05.875
â™ª Figures up ahead

37:05.919 --> 37:07.312
Hi, Murphy.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.662
â™ª Moving in the trees

37:09.705 --> 37:11.272
â™ª White skin in linen...

37:11.316 --> 37:13.013
Hi, Nia.

37:13.056 --> 37:16.146
You think I was gonna let youhandle this negotiation alone?

37:16.190 --> 37:18.192
â™ª And the full moon
that hangs over... â™ª

37:18.236 --> 37:21.848
Baby, I'm done trusting youwith any part of my business.

37:21.891 --> 37:25.286
â™ª Dreams in the mist

37:25.330 --> 37:27.897
â™ª Darkness on the edge

37:27.941 --> 37:30.900
â™ª Shadows where I stand

37:30.944 --> 37:32.467
â™ª I search for the time...

37:32.511 --> 37:34.382
This the guy that knows where
the drugs are hiding?

37:34.426 --> 37:36.471
â™ª With no hands...

37:36.515 --> 37:38.908
Yeah.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.476
Tell me he told you wherethey were before this happened.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.305
No. I can explain...

37:44.349 --> 37:46.307
Vincent, I'm gonna havea little chat with Murphy.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.917
Nia, this isn't her fault.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.354
Seriously, if anything,

37:49.397 --> 37:50.833
it's my fault.I'm gonna get

37:50.877 --> 37:52.444
to you two in a second.
Vincent, take 'em in the back.

37:57.318 --> 38:01.975
I want... a little privacy
with my girl.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.675
Right over here.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.329
Sit.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.683
How about a drink?

38:14.727 --> 38:17.207
A little whiskey?

38:17.251 --> 38:19.862
Yeah.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.516
Whiskey.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.606
â™ª Could it be spring or fall?

38:24.650 --> 38:29.524
Now, let me see if I'm
understanding you correctly.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.048
You went behind my back
and tried to funnel

38:32.092 --> 38:34.355
all my drugs to Josiah.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.531
And then you gave
my entire shipment

38:36.575 --> 38:39.186
to this junkie, who's now
lying dead on the floor.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.450
â™ª Falling from my lips...

38:42.494 --> 38:45.627
Nia, I can explain...[cries out]

38:45.671 --> 38:48.238
[coughing]

38:48.282 --> 38:50.371
â™ª When I close my eyes

38:50.415 --> 38:52.025
â™ª Every second...

38:52.068 --> 38:53.679
Get up.

38:53.722 --> 38:56.377
Come on.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.727
You're tougher than that.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.076
Come on.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.775
â™ª When it's cold outside,
every moment... â™ª

39:02.818 --> 39:05.604
I always trusted you, Murphy.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.388
And I don't trust
that many people.

39:07.432 --> 39:10.913
I guess this is why.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.438
[grunting]

39:13.481 --> 39:16.919
I can explain.
I can explain.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.704
No, I'm good.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.578
â™ª There's something out there

39:23.622 --> 39:27.365
â™ª I can't resist

39:27.408 --> 39:28.931
â™ª These dreams go on...

39:28.975 --> 39:31.151
[laughing]

39:31.194 --> 39:36.112
Oh, that's what I always
liked about you, Murphy.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.766
You never give up, do you?

39:37.810 --> 39:40.639
â™ª I live another life,
these dreams... â™ª

39:40.682 --> 39:42.118
[cries out]

39:42.162 --> 39:43.816
Murphy!

39:43.859 --> 39:45.861
[panting]
Please let me go.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.820
[groans]

39:47.863 --> 39:50.388
[record scratching]

39:58.396 --> 40:01.007
Hang tight, honey.
Almost there.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.795
Give me your gun.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.188
No, Nia, don't.You don't have to do this.

40:08.231 --> 40:11.496
Shut up.Are you sure?
I mean, I can do it.

40:11.539 --> 40:14.020
I want to.

40:15.848 --> 40:16.979
No, wait, please.Nia, wait...

40:17.023 --> 40:18.024
Please!

40:19.547 --> 40:21.723
[straining]

40:36.521 --> 40:39.828
[wheezes]
Please don't. Please...

40:39.872 --> 40:41.569
Please don't. No, don't.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.353
Bye.

40:43.397 --> 40:47.357
[two gunshots]

40:47.401 --> 40:51.666
[shuddering]:No. No.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.712
[record scratching]

41:04.200 --> 41:06.899
