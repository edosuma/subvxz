Okay, Felix, we need to focus!

12:17.824 --> 12:20.130
Stop, we just needto get Josiah

12:20.174 --> 12:21.305
to pick up everything,like, right now.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.525
Josiah.But he

12:23.568 --> 12:25.745
gave me his number, though.
So maybe I'll just call him?

12:25.788 --> 12:26.963
I'm gonna call him.Okay.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.138
Okay?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
Call Josiah.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.838
[phone ringing]

12:41.369 --> 12:42.587
Yes?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.764
Hey, it's Murphy.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
Who?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.984
Murphy Mason.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.551
Uh, you were supposed
to pick up some stuff

12:49.594 --> 12:51.205
from me tomorrow,but there's been a change

12:51.248 --> 12:52.859
in plans, and I need youto pick it up from me,

12:52.902 --> 12:55.557
Now.um... now.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.341
Now?

12:57.385 --> 12:59.387
Yes.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.130
You can bring it to me.

13:03.173 --> 13:06.873
Um... that was not partof the deal, so...

13:06.916 --> 13:08.657
I said tomorrow.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.746
I can't get a crew together
this last minute.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.357
You want it out,
get it out yourself,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.359
and bring it to me.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.057
Call me when you're on your way.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.362
I'll tell you where
to meet my guys.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.755
Okay.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.843
What?

13:22.453 --> 13:23.977
Murphy!Felix...

13:24.020 --> 13:25.239
That's not okay...

13:25.282 --> 13:26.631
There are cameras
down there!

13:26.675 --> 13:28.068
A lot of cameras!

13:28.111 --> 13:29.634
Which is why Josiah
was gonna bring a crew

13:29.678 --> 13:30.766
with, like, tech
guys and stuff.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.072
Can you justshut the power off?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.900
No, you cannot just
shut the power off.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.250
I guarantee you Nia has someone
constantly watching that.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.252
Well, then what werethe tech guys gonna do?

13:38.295 --> 13:40.210
I don't know, probably loop
a few minutes of the basement

13:40.254 --> 13:41.908
being empty while
they cleared it out.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.039
That's a thing?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.867
Have you not seen Speed?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.174
Oh, my God.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.437
Wait, hang on.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.700
Let me see if I
can try and do it.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.442
Pop quiz, hotshot.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.359
Okay, Nia's guys leftthe default login credentials,

13:58.402 --> 14:00.274
meaning we'reon the same network,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.711
so I can use an addressresolution protocol poisoning

14:02.754 --> 14:04.756
to fool the FTP server.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.237
Right, I was also
gonna suggest that.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.197
Okay, when I hit play

14:10.240 --> 14:12.242
on this looped footage,
we should be good to go.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.375
Okay, I need you
to go to the basement,

14:14.418 --> 14:16.507
walk in front of the drugs,
see if this worked.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.381
Just walk? Just walk?

14:20.424 --> 14:21.904
Straight.Okay...

14:21.948 --> 14:24.428
End of the fence,left, first door.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.822
Don't fall down the stairs.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.442
So?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.618
Worked.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.619
Really?

14:41.663 --> 14:42.794
Yeah.

14:42.838 --> 14:43.970
Come on.

14:44.013 --> 14:44.709
Let's go.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.276
We don't have much time.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.242
Okay, go.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.649
[slurps]

15:14.217 --> 15:15.871
I've lapped you
so many times.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.525
I'm sorry.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
I'm going as fastas I possibly can.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.789
Just hurry, okay?I'm trying.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.673
[groans]

15:47.511 --> 15:49.470
[knocking]

15:49.513 --> 15:50.993
Who is that?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.777
The cops?I don't know.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.127
Hang on.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.130
[knocking continues]

16:00.611 --> 16:03.092
Hey. The lady does
not wish to see you.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.746
And, quite frankly,
neither do I.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.053
Open the door!

16:07.096 --> 16:08.097
No! I-- If I were you...

16:08.141 --> 16:10.143
[loud rattling]Okay.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.232
What? What? What?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.234
Hey!Murphy!

16:14.277 --> 16:15.452
You've got a lot

16:15.496 --> 16:17.019
of nerve, man, coming here.Murphy, look,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.238
I need to explaineverything.

16:18.281 --> 16:21.067
Oh, my God.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.503
Yeah.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.939
As you can see,
we're a little busy

16:23.983 --> 16:26.420
cleaning up the mess
that yougot us in.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.987
Mm-hmm.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.990
There's a cop outside.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.039
Oh, God. That cop is literallythere to make sure we don't move

16:37.083 --> 16:39.781
the drugs. They're probably just
waiting for a warrant, so...

16:39.824 --> 16:42.653
we're toast! We're toast!Stop it.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.264
We just need to figure out
a way to get everything

16:44.307 --> 16:46.527
out of here
a little more discreetly.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.094
Cool. Sounds good.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.530
Why-why is thereso much heroin here?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.140
Why are youhere?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.142
Go. I d-- I don't--
I can't even be around you.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.317
FELIX:Okay, I haveto figure out

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
where we're gonna hide this.Murphy.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.799
Don't. Stop.Just lis-listen to me.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.801
You have immunity.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.716
I don't know
what that means.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.197
Dean found the drugsin Chloe's cane.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.546
He had pictures of it.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.069
He was gonna put you awayfor years

17:07.113 --> 17:09.593
unless you could incriminateNia, which you did.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.942
So you're good.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
Oh, I'm good? I'm good?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.076
Thank you so much.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.122
He had evidence, Murphy.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.732
What was I supposed to do?

17:17.775 --> 17:20.735
I don't know.
The opposite of what you did.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.953
I only did this because I knew

17:21.997 --> 17:23.564
you would never workfor Dean yourself.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.914
Yeah. You're right.Cool.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.221
So I was just supposed to letyou go to prison for years?

17:28.264 --> 17:30.092
No, I had it handled.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.441
I had it figured out.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.660
We were gonna get out.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.663
We were gonna get
out in 24 hours.

17:35.706 --> 17:39.101
But you ruined...
everything.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
You ruined it.I was trying to help!

17:41.147 --> 17:43.410
MURPHY:
I don't need your help.Oh, my God!

17:43.453 --> 17:45.760
Yeah, okay, I-- Yeah,
I know. I know that.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.805
You don't need anybody's
help. I get it. Okay?I had it handled.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.590
MAX: You're impossible.I had it handled.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.592
MAX: Yeah. Clearly,
you had it handled.I did.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.117
Just get out. Just-just
get out of here.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.772
I love that you're allowedto save me whenever you want,

17:57.815 --> 18:01.036
but God forbid I tryto do one th...Holy crap.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.735
Ben?

18:04.779 --> 18:07.129
Yeah. Hey.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.696
What are you
doing here?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.915
I thought you guyswere just slinging dime bags.

18:10.959 --> 18:14.223
But that's-that's impressive.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.659
Who is this person?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.531
I'm the
receptionist.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.663
How do you do?

18:19.707 --> 18:22.710
I got to take a leak.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.104
It's fine.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.409
He knows everything
that's happening.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.498
Murphy, you needto listen to me.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.326
You're not gonna doany prison time.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.024
I don't believe a word that
comes out of Dean's mouth.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.330
Yeah, me neither.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.289
That's why I had himput it in writing.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.769
Did you get
immunity for Felix?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.163
Can Felix
just walk away?

18:41.207 --> 18:44.035
Or am I supposed to leave
him with all this?

18:44.079 --> 18:45.689
'Cause I'm not gonna do that.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.343
So, if you'll excuse me,

18:47.387 --> 18:49.215
I'm in the middle
of something.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.956
Let me at least help you.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.610
I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.046
[door closes]FELIX:Actually,

18:55.090 --> 18:56.178
I sort of do.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.701
We need to drag up, like,

18:57.745 --> 18:58.920
a bunch more of these.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.574
[sighs]

19:04.665 --> 19:06.667
[alarm beeps]

19:19.419 --> 19:21.160
[sighs]

19:31.735 --> 19:32.693
What's going on?

19:32.736 --> 19:33.868
I forgot something
on my desk.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.044
Picture of my daughter.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.046
Take care of yourself, Dean.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.048
Will do!

19:50.537 --> 19:52.234
[rattling]

20:07.771 --> 20:09.382
All right.Let's load 'em.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.949
Truck's out front, okay?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.995
[strained]:
Okay.

20:15.953 --> 20:16.911
[grunts]

20:16.954 --> 20:18.217
Okay.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.097
[knocking]

20:34.494 --> 20:36.496
[exhales]

20:38.280 --> 20:40.239
[sighs]

20:44.112 --> 20:46.157
Long time no see.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.160
Come in.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.825
What do you want?

21:01.869 --> 21:05.307
I think it's more
about what youwant.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
Oh, I think I was very clearwhere I stood with you.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.530
So, you call me in the middle ofthe night demanding a meeting.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.661
Just get to the point.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.143
The DEA is closing in,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
as are the IRS
and Chicago PD.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.321
Mm-hmm.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.714
I also happen to know

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
that you moved the warehouse
deal to Guiding Hope.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.457
All right, well, you obviously
ain't got a warrant.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.154
Otherwise, you would have
already raided it.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.156
That is true.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.768
I was fired
when I even brought it up.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.901
Seems like you don't understandthe concept of leverage.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.990
Hmm.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.340
Stole everything
the Feds have on you,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.647
took the liberty of printing upa small sample.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.302
The rest is encrypted
on a USB drive.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.227
These are my private books.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.230
Phone conversations.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.928
Nia...

22:00.971 --> 22:03.496
they are going
to get you.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.802
With this, you'll know exactly
what you have to move,

22:05.846 --> 22:08.152
what you have to shut down
before it's too late.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.243
And what do you get in return?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.771
A cut of the shipment. 20%.

22:17.814 --> 22:21.905
Five, and you know I don'tnegotiate, so don't even try me.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.213
Oh, uh, one more thing.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.737
You, uh, might want to
move all your heroin.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.699
You said no one was on to it.

22:32.742 --> 22:36.093
No... not because of the cops.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.706
MAX: Guess the life
of crime suits you.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.797
MURPHY:Well, yeah. I'm not gonna be init for very much longer, so...

22:43.840 --> 22:45.886
MAX:
What do you mean?

22:45.929 --> 22:48.410
MURPHY:
We're giving everything
we have to someone else,

22:48.454 --> 22:52.545
to this dude Josiah,
so... anyway, it's done.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.808
Murphy is at Guiding
Hope right now.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.419
I think she's planning
to move it to him tonight.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.208
I'm gonnakill that bitch.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.647
You go find
every guy we got,

23:07.690 --> 23:09.431
and you get 'em
over to Guiding Hope.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.085
I want my stashout of there tonight.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.304
And where the hell is Sam?
Get her over there, too.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.092
I'll call you as soonas I get everything back,

23:18.135 --> 23:19.615
and I'll give you your piece.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.705
Sounds good.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.100
Wait, wait.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.754
Are there gonna be
any cops there?

23:27.797 --> 23:31.279
Only my partner, but
he's working rogue.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.020
Can my guys take him?

23:33.063 --> 23:35.065
[sighs]

23:36.066 --> 23:38.068
Yeah.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.169
[panting]

24:07.402 --> 24:09.448
[engine starts]

24:12.146 --> 24:14.278
That's so dumb.

24:24.724 --> 24:25.899
[siren wailing]

24:25.942 --> 24:27.466
[engine starts]

24:32.819 --> 24:34.864
He's pulling us over.
