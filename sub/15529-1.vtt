WEBVTT

00:47.198 --> 00:50.410
Rule number one, know your products.

00:50.493 --> 00:54.455
Okay, whether it's a PC or a piece of paper;
know how it works.

00:56.708 --> 01:00.002
Number two, know your customers.

01:00.086 --> 01:02.463
Learn everything you can about them.

01:02.547 --> 01:05.758
Listen to what they want
and what they don't want.

01:07.051 --> 01:11.180
Rule number three, go the extra yard, okay?

01:11.264 --> 01:15.351
If you don't have the answer; find it.
It's that simple.

01:16.561 --> 01:19.063
Okay, let's go get those numbers up.

01:20.231 --> 01:22.150
- Hi, Nick.
- Hey, Gary.

01:22.984 --> 01:25.403
- Solid presentation there.
- Thank you.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.322
Same one you gave last month, right?

01:29.407 --> 01:30.950
How'd it go in Houston?

01:31.033 --> 01:32.452
Great. It went great.

01:32.535 --> 01:35.204
- How's the wife?
- She's fine, thank you.

01:35.288 --> 01:37.665
- Kids?
- Kids?

01:39.375 --> 01:40.460
I don't have kids.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.463
Oh, right. Yeah.
You don't have kids.

01:50.428 --> 01:51.763
So listen, Nick.

01:51.846 --> 01:54.599
The company has decided to make a change.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.809
My numbers are as solid
as they've ever been.

01:56.893 --> 01:59.107
- It's not about numbers anymore.
- I've done everything the company

01:59.187 --> 02:00.438
has asked me to do.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.191
I promised that my drinking would be
under control, and it is.

02:03.274 --> 02:04.901
Not in Denver, apparently.

02:15.036 --> 02:18.956
I made this office into a major player
My record reflects that.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.042
You want to talk about your record, Nick?

02:22.043 --> 02:25.254
1998, one month paid leave
for alcohol counseling.

02:25.338 --> 02:29.467
2000, another 30 days.
2001, accused of assault.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.723
It was a softball game.
The guy was blocking the plate.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.638
2003, DUI.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.973
2005, destruction of corporate can

02:36.057 --> 02:38.518
I've given 16 years of my life
to this company.

02:38.601 --> 02:42.355
And the company has rewarded you
very well for your loyalty.

02:43.231 --> 02:47.568
Mr. Goodson and the rest of the higher-ups
wanted you to have this

02:47.652 --> 02:49.946
as a token of their appreciation.

02:50.488 --> 02:52.949
You can keep the corporate car
until the end of the month.

02:53.032 --> 02:55.326
You can keep your health benefits, too,
which is good.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.662
Your files are all corporate property,
of course,

02:57.745 --> 03:02.458
but you can take three file boxes with you
containing your personal items.

03:02.542 --> 03:04.418
That should just about cover it.

04:40.222 --> 04:42.183
And one of those cherry Slurpees, too.

04:44.268 --> 04:46.437
- This guy. I don't know.
- I got it. I got it.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.274
Hey, bro, I'll give you 10 bucks
for that twack right there.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.113
Aren't you a little young
to be drinking beers?

04:52.193 --> 04:54.954
Aren't you a little old to be drinking
that Slurpee there, gray balls?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.993
Is that what they teach you in school,
little shit?

04:57.073 --> 04:58.199
What?

07:00.696 --> 07:02.573
Hi. Are you in there?

07:05.493 --> 07:08.454
If you are, can this happen another day?

07:44.532 --> 07:47.576
Hi, it's Nick. I'm back.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.953
I got your letter

07:49.036 --> 07:51.580
I really want to talk to you, okay?

07:52.081 --> 07:54.250
I 'll just be getting some
of the stuff off the lawn

07:54.333 --> 07:57.920
and getting it out of here
if that's all right with you.

07:58.003 --> 08:00.381
When you're ready, we can talk.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.552
And you probably already heard,

08:05.261 --> 08:08.055
I lost my job today. So...

08:11.225 --> 08:13.018
Okay, bye.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.911
Oh, great.

08:37.543 --> 08:40.587
Hey, Elliot. You're home early.

08:41.046 --> 08:43.424
Well, benefit of being the boss, I guess.

08:45.259 --> 08:50.472
You know, having all that stuff on your lawn
is gonna destroy your root system.

08:50.556 --> 08:53.976
Yeah, I'm sorry about the mess.

08:54.518 --> 08:57.521
- I'll have it cleaned up by tomorrow.
- Great.

08:59.315 --> 09:03.402
Listen, Nick. You know me,
I try to keep out of people's way.

09:03.485 --> 09:06.488
But if I'm honest,
I saw this coming a mile away.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.365
Thanks for warning me.

09:08.449 --> 09:10.034
No problem.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.593
Come on.

11:51.028 --> 11:53.238
I like your bumper stickers.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.076
Right, I probably should have taken them off
before I hit Texas, right?

11:57.159 --> 11:59.912
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.499
I'm Nick. My wife Catherine
and I live across the street.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.085
Samantha.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.504
You can just put that in there
with the others.

12:08.587 --> 12:09.671
Okay.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.593
So are you getting rid of your old stuff?

12:14.676 --> 12:17.388
Yeah. Just a little spring cleaning.

12:19.765 --> 12:24.186
- You a photographer?
- Yeah. Photography teacher.

12:24.269 --> 12:26.897
- Really? Where do you teach?
- New York.

12:27.606 --> 12:32.111
My husband...
Well, we are relocating for work.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.029
I lived in Newark for two years.

12:34.113 --> 12:36.031
Westchester County.

12:36.115 --> 12:37.783
Well, welcome to Arizona.

12:37.866 --> 12:39.201
Thank you.

12:40.828 --> 12:45.833
Hey, could I ask you a favor?
Would you mind watching my stuff?

12:45.916 --> 12:49.586
- I just need to run to the store real quick.
- Sure, yeah.

12:49.670 --> 12:54.091
You know, no, I can't.
I have to go meet my new doctor.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.343
Sure. Sure, I understand.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.388
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

12:59.471 --> 13:01.640
Yeah, likewise. I'll see you around.

13:01.723 --> 13:02.850
Yeah.

13:16.572 --> 13:18.115
Can I help you?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.369
Do you live around here?

13:22.453 --> 13:25.122
My mom takes care of the lady
down the street.

13:25.789 --> 13:27.708
Why aren't you at work?

13:28.292 --> 13:30.127
I got the day off.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.629
Why'd you get the day off?

13:33.755 --> 13:35.340
Personal stuff.

13:35.841 --> 13:37.384
With your wife?

13:39.720 --> 13:40.762
Why do you say that?

13:41.555 --> 13:42.931
I saw her yesterday.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.642
Some dudes came over, too.

13:46.602 --> 13:47.853
What dudes?

13:48.687 --> 13:52.232
Like a locksmith guy, an alarm guy,

13:53.400 --> 13:55.486
and, like, some movers.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.323
She say anything?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.200
She was screaming a lot.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.285
And crying.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.915
What's your name?

14:09.291 --> 14:10.918
Kenny Loftus.

14:11.835 --> 14:13.879
Listen, Kenny, are you hungry?

14:16.465 --> 14:19.885
If you stay here and watch my stuff,
I'll go buy us some food, huh?

14:19.968 --> 14:21.929
How's that sound?

14:22.012 --> 14:23.764
Here's 5 bucks. Okay?

14:24.765 --> 14:27.100
You just can't leave.
And don't touch anything.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.939
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, the liquor store.

14:32.606 --> 14:36.068
- What about the mini-mart?
- Yeah, I can go to the mini-mart.

14:36.151 --> 14:38.671
If I go to the mini-mart,
will you stay here and watch my stuff?

14:41.240 --> 14:45.160
I'd like some beef jerky and a Diet Coke.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.620
Okay.

14:49.164 --> 14:50.624
Oh, shit.

14:51.917 --> 14:55.379
- What are you looking for?
- My car keys.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.633
- You want to borrow my bike?
- No, I'll find them.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.332
Sorry, dude, it didn't go through.

15:28.412 --> 15:30.247
Can you just swipe it again, please?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.295
It didn't go through, Mr. Halsey.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.459
- Really?
- Nope.

15:35.377 --> 15:36.632
Something's probably wrong
with the machine.

15:36.712 --> 15:39.339
- Can you just call it in?
- I can't call it in, man.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.510
- How much is it?
- $37.50.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.183
Hey, honey, it's Nick.

15:50.267 --> 15:55.063
I just tried to buy some things
with the credit cards and they didn't work.

15:55.147 --> 15:59.735
Look, I'm gonna need them
to pay someone to move stuff off the lawn.

15:59.818 --> 16:05.365
So if you can just call me back
and we can possibly work this out,

16:06.158 --> 16:09.536
I'd really appreciate it. Okay?
Thank you. Bye.

16:09.870 --> 16:13.498
Mr. Halsey, I checked the ATM
it's working fine.

16:13.582 --> 16:17.252
Okay. Well, that doesn't make any sense.
There's $45,000 in that account.

16:17.336 --> 16:18.962
The money's still there.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.506
But apparently someone
put a stop on that account.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.091
But that's my account.

16:23.175 --> 16:24.676
Technically, it's a joint account

16:24.760 --> 16:27.471
and either you or your wife
can put a stop on it.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.514
Who authorized that?

16:30.098 --> 16:35.103
You did. Your signature is right here, sir.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.356
Next to your wife's.

16:41.693 --> 16:44.321
Your service
has been temporarily suspended.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.865
For an emergency, dial 9-1-1.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.098
Can I help you?

17:12.182 --> 17:13.684
Yeah, this is my car.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.936
This car belongs to Office Expo Inc.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.231
Really?
Well, that's my stuff right back there.

17:19.314 --> 17:21.441
If it's inside the car,
it belongs to the company now.

17:21.525 --> 17:23.609
So you're gonna have to
take it up with them.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.445
Hey. Hey, look.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.741
I don't want any problems, okay?
I just want my stuff.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.706
Excuse me. Hey. Hey, hey!

17:36.373 --> 17:37.999
This is my car.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.711
Those are my golf clubs.
Those are my golf clubs.

17:56.518 --> 17:58.979
Why didn't you try to stop him?

17:59.062 --> 18:01.064
He said it was his car.

18:02.983 --> 18:04.901
Did you get my jerky?

18:05.610 --> 18:06.695
Yeah.

18:11.283 --> 18:12.784
Where'd you get that?

18:13.994 --> 18:15.162
- That?
- Yeah.

18:15.245 --> 18:18.248
- In the pile.
- I told you not to touch anything.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.208
Why?

18:20.292 --> 18:23.754
'Cause some of it, like this,

18:23.837 --> 18:25.881
is worth a lot of money.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.175
You know what this is?

18:30.093 --> 18:31.178
A baseball?

18:31.762 --> 18:35.682
A baseball signed by the entire
'78 world champion Yankees.

18:37.934 --> 18:39.519
Reggie Jackson?

18:40.687 --> 18:41.813
Thurman Munson?

18:42.314 --> 18:43.690
Ron Guidry?

18:48.695 --> 18:50.030
Never mind.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.701
We have a good team at my school.

18:55.452 --> 18:56.661
Yeah? Do you play?

18:57.370 --> 19:00.916
I tried out last year, but I didn't make it.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.918
Well, there's always next year.

19:03.001 --> 19:07.756
Look, I've got work I've got to do here. So...

19:13.887 --> 19:15.347
Isn't your mom worried about you?

19:16.640 --> 19:18.683
She'll be gone till Miss Cooper dies.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.435
She just leaves you alone?

19:21.770 --> 19:24.314
My sister comes around at night.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.610
Kenny, I'm gonna try the direct approach
with you, okay?

19:28.693 --> 19:31.613
I need you to leave. Now.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.996
I found your keys.

21:23.308 --> 21:27.354
571 Xray. Yeah, we're out here.
Code 4 for now.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.023
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

21:30.106 --> 21:31.626
Can I see some identification, please?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.818
I left it in my car.

21:34.402 --> 21:35.695
And where's your car?

21:36.404 --> 21:39.699
It's gone.
Even though, technically, it wasn't mine.

21:40.492 --> 21:42.289
You want to tell me
what you're doing out here?

21:42.369 --> 21:45.956
Yeah, I would.
I'm just organizing some of my things.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.123
Why? Is there a problem?

21:47.207 --> 21:49.968
Yeah, we've gotten some complaints
about someone living on their lawn.

21:50.418 --> 21:53.088
Really? Who complained?

21:53.171 --> 21:54.756
I can't tell you that, sir.

21:57.175 --> 22:01.721
Well, this is my lawn. And this is my house.

22:01.805 --> 22:04.766
And I'm pretty sure
I can do whatever I want on my property.

22:04.849 --> 22:07.143
How much have you had to drink?

22:08.853 --> 22:10.772
In my opinion, not enough.

22:10.855 --> 22:13.655
You know there's a law against having
open containers in public, right?

22:14.025 --> 22:17.028
There's a law that says I can't drink
a fucking beer on my front lawn?

22:17.112 --> 22:18.672
Sir, you're gonna have to come with me.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.449
I can't leave my stuff.

22:21.533 --> 22:23.743
Your things will be fine. Let's go.
Turn around.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.371
571 Xray. Yeah, why don't you...

22:26.454 --> 22:28.331
Hey, stop talking into that thing.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.500
- Stand by.
- Just listen to me.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.669
Call Detective Frank Garcia, okay?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.504
You want me to call Detective Garcia?

22:34.587 --> 22:37.674
Yeah, call him. Call him. He'll fix all of this.

22:38.008 --> 22:40.135
He wasn't violent, right?

22:40.218 --> 22:42.512
No, man, he's just been drinking.
He asked me to call you.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.764
Thanks, man. I got it from here.

22:47.851 --> 22:51.896
I came as soon as I could.
I had a double homicide.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.107
Thanks, Frank.

22:55.483 --> 22:56.568
Did you talk to her?

22:57.318 --> 23:00.613
No, I think it's worth
giving her a little time on this one.

23:01.573 --> 23:04.159
She changed all the locks, you know?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.369
Garage code.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.080
How do you change the garage code?

23:10.790 --> 23:13.918
You haven't tried to break in yet.
I'm impressed.

23:14.002 --> 23:16.212
Last time I broke in, you arrested me.

23:16.296 --> 23:17.881
That's right.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.883
You know that the moment
that you even thought

23:19.966 --> 23:22.006
about having a drink
you should have just called me.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.846
Well, let's see.

23:24.929 --> 23:27.724
Yesterday, what happened?

23:27.807 --> 23:31.519
I got fired from my job and my wife left me.

23:31.603 --> 23:34.564
So somehow calling you slipped my mind.

23:35.190 --> 23:37.150
I got it. I got it.

23:39.986 --> 23:44.616
You know, they say that the dining room
is the least utilized room in the house.

23:44.699 --> 23:46.367
I think it's the front lawn.

23:46.743 --> 23:49.788
It's starting to look good, don't you think?

23:49.871 --> 23:53.500
I don't care how it looks.
You can't stay here. it's illegal.

23:54.709 --> 23:58.546
I paid for this house, for her fish,
for this lawn.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.131
This is my house.

24:00.215 --> 24:02.675
- What's your point?
- My point?

24:05.512 --> 24:10.100
This is my corner. Okay?
I'm not leaving my stuff.

24:16.481 --> 24:20.652
All right. I'll call dispatch
and make sure nobody comes by tonight.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.863
But slow down on the beer, yeah?
Get some rest.

24:24.405 --> 24:26.950
We'll figure this out tomorrow.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.625
She's coming up on a year.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.628
I know, Nick. We still go to meetings.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.799
- Hey, Frank.
- Yeah?

24:44.259 --> 24:46.261
You're a good sponsor, you know?

24:46.886 --> 24:50.306
Actually, Nick, I'm not.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

26:33.326 --> 26:34.994
It's a great rug.

26:36.579 --> 26:37.747
Yeah, it was my mom's.

26:38.206 --> 26:39.791
I got you some coffee and cigarettes.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.918
I quit smoking.

26:45.296 --> 26:46.381
Thanks.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.343
You need any help moving today?

26:50.927 --> 26:52.679
No, I'm good.

26:52.762 --> 26:56.099
Really? Not planning to leave
anytime soon?

26:56.182 --> 26:58.685
Well, since I don't have any money
or car or phone,

26:58.768 --> 27:01.521
I was just thinking about just staying here.

27:03.564 --> 27:06.651
Do you honestly think
that this is how you're gonna get her back?

27:06.734 --> 27:08.778
I'm just living day to day.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.113
Right. Right.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.619
How many days you think
it's gonna take to get your shit together?

27:12.699 --> 27:14.284
You're gonna make me leave?

27:15.201 --> 27:18.121
I'm not gonna tell you what to do
because we both know that doesn't work.

27:18.496 --> 27:20.623
But if it takes you sitting here

27:20.707 --> 27:24.460
and making an idiot out of yourself
to get cleaned up, then so be it.

27:26.004 --> 27:27.714
The city of Arcadia

27:29.382 --> 27:33.136
allows a property owner to hold a yard sale
for no more than five consecutive days.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.721
This buys you three days.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.978
I don't want to sell my stuff.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.189
Sell your crap, don't sell your crap.
I don't care.

27:45.273 --> 27:47.108
But after this, you move on.

27:47.191 --> 27:51.738
I got you some pens
and some paper to make signs.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.657
I got to make signs?

27:55.408 --> 27:58.328
- That was a joke.
- Don't make an ass out of me, Nick.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.662
No, it was a funny joke.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.501
You have three days
to get your shit together.

28:01.581 --> 28:03.708
If not, I'm gonna have to
haul your ass off to jail.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.267
Right. Mount Rushmore.

28:22.310 --> 28:24.687
Grand Canyon.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.147
That's nice.

29:21.536 --> 29:23.287
- Hey, Kenny.
- Hey.

29:24.330 --> 29:28.251
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- It's cool, man.

29:29.419 --> 29:30.670
How's your penmanship?

29:31.212 --> 29:32.797
Pretty good.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.801
I was thinking,
seeing as you're not doing anything

29:36.884 --> 29:39.345
but riding your bike all day,

29:39.429 --> 29:40.829
you might want to come work for me.

29:41.764 --> 29:43.015
What Kind of work?

29:43.474 --> 29:46.352
Make some signs.
Maybe sell a couple of things.

29:48.521 --> 29:49.856
What are you offering?

29:51.149 --> 29:54.360
Discussing salary and responsibility
upfront, smart, very smart.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.821
I'm thinking 4 bucks an hour, okay?

29:57.280 --> 30:01.951
If I have to leave, you stay here,
watch my stuff, act tough.

30:02.869 --> 30:06.747
I'll feed you, give you bathroom and
cigarette breaks as required by state law.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.708
I don't smoke.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.462
Good. Great. So do we got a deal?

30:14.046 --> 30:17.049
Arizona minimum wage is $7.25.

30:17.133 --> 30:18.968
Okay, $7.25 it is.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.221
What? It's a good deal.

30:23.848 --> 30:26.392
I want to learn to play baseball.

30:27.435 --> 30:29.235
You want me to teach you
how to play baseball?

30:30.563 --> 30:32.523
Yeah, I don't know.

30:32.607 --> 30:34.901
I see all your trophies and stuff on the lawn.

30:34.984 --> 30:37.695
Yeah, I know. That's from high school.

30:38.738 --> 30:40.418
Why do you want to learn to play baseball?

30:40.990 --> 30:43.201
My mom says I need the exercise.

30:45.870 --> 30:47.246
Okay, I could see that.

30:47.330 --> 30:49.081
And my dad played.

30:51.709 --> 30:52.793
Okay.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.087
Now we got a deal?

30:57.673 --> 30:59.175
- Deal.
- Okay.

31:00.760 --> 31:04.263
Start making some signs.
This is the sign area right here.

31:04.347 --> 31:07.350
No, I haven't met the neighbors yet.

31:09.477 --> 31:11.896
Yes, there's grass.

31:11.979 --> 31:13.523
What about these clothes?

31:13.606 --> 31:14.941
Keep.

31:15.566 --> 31:19.612
Put them in that top, left-hand drawer.

31:24.784 --> 31:26.327
What about these?

31:31.791 --> 31:32.959
Yeah, those.

31:33.042 --> 31:35.127
Think I want to hold onto those.

31:35.211 --> 31:38.214
They're actually pretty valuable.
You'd be surprised.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.091
You can put 'em in that same drawer.

31:40.174 --> 31:43.135
I'll know that they're there in case I want to

31:44.470 --> 31:46.472
look at 'em.

31:47.181 --> 31:50.268
So when are you coming?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.315
Well...

31:57.191 --> 32:01.404
Okay. Okay, Well, when will you know?

32:09.370 --> 32:11.664
- Can I help you?
- How much?

32:12.206 --> 32:17.086
I'm sorry, the shoes are not for sale.
They shouldn't be over there, actually.

32:24.260 --> 32:25.595
How much for the chair?

32:26.554 --> 32:29.223
You know, it's not for sale, either.

32:38.399 --> 32:40.067
How much for this?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.696
- You want to buy that?
- How much is it?

32:45.740 --> 32:47.199
50 CENTS.

32:48.701 --> 32:49.952
I'll give you 25 cents.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.954
Yeah, I just can't do that.

32:53.831 --> 32:58.586
Hold on, hold on.
Let's keep it at 50 and let's see.

33:00.963 --> 33:02.965
I'll throw in some floss.

33:05.801 --> 33:08.554
Great. Have a good one.

33:11.015 --> 33:14.935
Rule number eight,
always give 'em a little something extra.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.438
There's your take.

33:18.981 --> 33:22.568
- Can we work on baseball now?
- I'm beat.

33:23.152 --> 33:28.074
Why don't you go hang some more signs
or something and we'll call it a day?

33:32.578 --> 33:35.414
I don't know why I'm hanging signs
if you're not gonna sell anything.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.251
I sold some mouthwash.

33:41.045 --> 33:42.171
Okay.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.675
- Thank you.
- Sure.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.137
- Where do you want this?
- I guess, just...

33:50.221 --> 33:53.140
You can just leave it over there somewhere.

33:55.643 --> 33:58.729
So is this your first time for a yard sale?

34:02.108 --> 34:04.735
Yeah. Yeah, it is, actually.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.572
Watch out for the pros on Saturday.

34:09.657 --> 34:11.992
They'll try to beat you up on price.

34:13.411 --> 34:15.286
Do you go to a lot of them?

34:15.371 --> 34:18.331
Yeah, they're good for finding old cameras.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.503
Once you get rid of all that stuff,
you're gonna feel great.

34:22.585 --> 34:25.672
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

34:26.882 --> 34:30.553
Hey. I was gonna order Chinese food.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.639
It's not New York, but...

34:34.139 --> 34:38.226
You know, I have a lot of stuff to do
before my husband gets here.

34:38.853 --> 34:41.188
Right. No, I understand.

34:41.272 --> 34:44.315
- But thank you for the offer.
- Sure.

34:45.568 --> 34:47.194
Could I use your phone?

34:48.779 --> 34:50.030
To order?

35:06.005 --> 35:07.089
Hey.

35:19.268 --> 35:21.145
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:21.228 --> 35:23.105
I saw you got your food

35:23.189 --> 35:26.108
and I thought you could use
something to eat with.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.778
- Here.
- Well, thank you.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.321
You're welcome.

35:30.404 --> 35:34.408
Can I... Do you want...
Can I make you a plate?

35:36.786 --> 35:37.787
- Yeah, sure.
- Why not?

35:37.870 --> 35:39.705
- Right. Thank you.
- Great.

35:39.789 --> 35:40.831
No.

35:42.082 --> 35:45.169
- Do you mind if I look through?
- Go ahead.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.256
God, these are incredible.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.675
Yeah.

35:52.259 --> 35:54.136
Wish I still had mine.

35:54.887 --> 35:57.264
Can't believe you still listen to vinyl.

35:57.348 --> 36:00.392
I don't. They were my father's.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.145
- He was a DJ.
- Yeah?

36:03.229 --> 36:09.109
The Late Night Mix with Glen Halsey
on KZOV.

36:10.361 --> 36:11.741
- Wow.
- Please, sit here if you want.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.989
No, no, I'll use this. This is fine, don't worry.

36:14.073 --> 36:15.950
There you go.

36:16.033 --> 36:17.827
Yeah, he played

36:18.661 --> 36:21.747
jazz, country, rock, Tejano,
all kinds of crazy stuff.

36:22.456 --> 36:25.000
He sounds like an interesting guy.

36:25.084 --> 36:28.254
Yeah, no. He was more of a drunk

36:29.255 --> 36:31.465
who occasionally did interesting things.

36:33.884 --> 36:36.679
So you're a teacher, huh?

36:38.722 --> 36:41.767
I guess I should say I'm a photographer,

36:41.851 --> 36:45.104
but teaching takes up most of my time.

36:45.229 --> 36:48.232
Have you ever had any shows of your work?

36:48.899 --> 36:51.777
Yeah, I've sold some pieces.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.405
Not enough to get rich, but...

36:56.991 --> 36:59.702
Actually, I sold one to my husband.
That's how we met.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.245
Okay.

37:03.497 --> 37:06.917
- So what do you do for work?
- Well,

37:09.253 --> 37:13.424
as of yesterday, I was
regional vice president

37:15.217 --> 37:17.970
at a very large corporation.

37:18.679 --> 37:21.724
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.934
Look, I made good money.
I bought this house.

37:24.018 --> 37:25.644
We've been to Europe,

37:26.312 --> 37:28.314
the Caribbean, Japan twice.

37:28.981 --> 37:31.984
- Wow.
- Yeah. So...

37:36.530 --> 37:37.907
Does he have a name yet?

37:38.574 --> 37:39.825
Yeah.

37:41.118 --> 37:42.995
Yeah, my husband wants to call him Jack.

37:44.788 --> 37:47.708
That's his name, my husband.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.464
I think it's a little ridiculous
naming a child after yourself.

37:54.131 --> 37:56.842
- Do you have kids?
- No.

37:58.093 --> 37:59.511
No, we don't.

38:01.597 --> 38:03.057
We have fish.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.478
The gold one here...

38:07.561 --> 38:09.605
- Asagi.
- Asagi.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.398
Yeah.

38:11.482 --> 38:16.820
She had the breeders shipped over
in those special containers from Japan.

38:18.113 --> 38:19.365
A grand each.

38:19.907 --> 38:22.326
This used to be our swimming pool.

38:23.369 --> 38:27.206
But it's not anymore. You know?

38:28.123 --> 38:30.459
So what's the music for?

38:31.210 --> 38:34.046
She'd read that it improves breeding.

38:36.507 --> 38:38.926
You know, it's okay. You can...

38:39.510 --> 38:41.804
You can ask me.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.555
Ask you what?

38:44.098 --> 38:46.600
About all that out front.

38:47.977 --> 38:51.522
I mean, you just moved here
and you have to look at it.

38:51.605 --> 38:54.900
Look, I'm sure whatever it is,
you can work it out.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.739
I was sober for six months.

39:02.366 --> 39:05.369
I had a couple of slipups,
you know, here and there.

39:05.452 --> 39:08.414
Nothing major. But I was trying, you know?

39:10.416 --> 39:14.920
And, well, I was on a business trip

39:15.713 --> 39:21.135
and we completed this very big deal.

39:22.094 --> 39:26.974
So I took everyone out to celebrate.

39:29.435 --> 39:34.815
There was this new girl, Sharon,
from the Denver office.

39:34.898 --> 39:37.151
So she got champagne for everyone.

39:38.652 --> 39:39.945
I figured,

39:42.865 --> 39:45.409
"I'll have a glass, right?" You know?

39:46.618 --> 39:48.120
Just to toast.

39:49.329 --> 39:53.000
We must have gone through
six or seven bottles.

39:53.083 --> 39:56.128
And then it was just us,

39:58.797 --> 40:00.674
in her room, you know,

40:02.968 --> 40:05.137
keeping the party going.

40:06.430 --> 40:08.057
So what happened?

40:09.224 --> 40:11.351
In the morning, she was gone.

40:15.189 --> 40:18.358
And then there were lawyers,

40:20.110 --> 40:25.491
and investigations and interviews.

40:27.785 --> 40:30.579
And, you know...

40:35.334 --> 40:37.419
Did you do it?

40:39.088 --> 40:41.173
Whatever they said you did?

40:49.264 --> 40:52.935
I don't know. I don't know.

41:02.736 --> 41:04.780
I should go.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.450
Here, let me take your plate.

41:09.284 --> 41:10.285
Let me walk you home.

41:10.369 --> 41:13.622
It's fine. I can walk across the street.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.792
Wait. Wait. Hold on.

41:18.627 --> 41:22.256
Don't forget this. Fortune cookie.

41:22.339 --> 41:23.549
Thanks.

41:25.592 --> 41:26.969
Good night.

41:37.896 --> 41:38.981
Hey.

41:41.275 --> 41:42.568
Hey.

42:29.072 --> 42:31.158
I like it. I like it.

42:33.118 --> 42:35.704
Are you listening to me? Pour some wine.

42:35.787 --> 42:39.041
- Come on, pour it.
- Come on, bring it.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.126
- That's it.
- Put it in! Put it in!

42:41.210 --> 42:43.670
- Put it in!
- Bark for me.

42:43.754 --> 42:45.589
Come on, bark.

42:45.672 --> 42:48.717
Yeah. Yeah, bark. Bark for me.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.721
Oh, I like that. You're a dog, aren't you?

42:52.804 --> 42:56.475
You're a great big dog. Nice puppy.

42:56.558 --> 43:00.229
Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!
I want some more wine.

43:00.312 --> 43:04.066
Keep barking, baby. Keep barking.

43:04.149 --> 43:06.068
You're a nice puppy.

43:16.745 --> 43:18.497
Yes, Nick?

44:15.304 --> 44:18.974
I'm interested in that rotisserie over here.

44:19.057 --> 44:22.144
- The rotisserie?
- Yeah, the rotisserie.

44:22.227 --> 44:23.478
One second.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.566
Nick.

44:27.649 --> 44:31.069
Hey, that guy wants to buy the rotisserie
5 bucks.

44:32.237 --> 44:33.739
What am I gonna cook with?

44:34.990 --> 44:36.658
You got the Foreman.

44:42.080 --> 44:46.001
Okay, tell him I'll sell it,
but that I'll only take $10, all right?

44:48.712 --> 44:49.838
He's not gonna do it.

44:49.921 --> 44:54.551
Well, tell him why he should buy it, right?
Focus on the benefits.

44:55.385 --> 44:58.472
Go ahead.
If you have to take $7, that's okay.

44:59.890 --> 45:01.266
He won't accept the $5.

45:01.350 --> 45:03.560
But I'll let you know
the rotisserie is brand new.

45:03.643 --> 45:07.105
He's only used it twice.
You can cook anything with it.

45:07.189 --> 45:09.232
He wants $10, but I'll take $7.

45:09.316 --> 45:11.276
- $7 is good.
- Thank you.

45:17.074 --> 45:18.116
Good sale.

45:19.785 --> 45:21.286
You got the gift.

45:23.497 --> 45:25.248
Kenny, take a seat.

45:30.212 --> 45:33.090
Look, you've been busting ass.
I just want you to know I appreciate it.

45:33.173 --> 45:36.718
All right? You know what?
This company needs a shake-up.

45:36.802 --> 45:40.764
We need a little less "me"
and a little more "we."

45:40.847 --> 45:42.849
Like this, not like this.

45:43.975 --> 45:46.019
Don't do that. Do that.

45:49.564 --> 45:50.899
Are you sure you're left-handed?

45:50.982 --> 45:52.484
Yeah, I'm sure.

45:54.486 --> 45:58.240
- Why don't you want to play football?
- My mom won't let me.

45:58.323 --> 46:00.867
That's a shame, Kenny,
'cause you're a born left tackle.

46:02.494 --> 46:04.746
Big, fast, smart.

46:06.832 --> 46:08.458
How about soccer?

46:09.501 --> 46:12.212
Black people don't play soccer.

46:12.295 --> 46:15.590
Whole continents of black people
play soccer.

46:15.674 --> 46:17.676
PelÃ©. You heard of him?

46:19.678 --> 46:22.347
Yeah, try not to be afraid of the ball.

46:22.848 --> 46:25.350
You know what? Why don't you practice
a little bit on your own?

46:25.976 --> 46:29.938
- How do I do that?
- Just throw it up in the air and catch it.

46:41.032 --> 46:43.493
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:45.871 --> 46:49.583
I found this. Used to be my mom's.

46:49.666 --> 46:52.043
- Wow.
- I don't Know if it still works.

46:52.127 --> 46:53.753
Let me see.

46:53.837 --> 46:56.173
Oh, God, it's beautiful.

46:56.256 --> 46:58.592
- Is there film in it?
- I don't know.

46:58.675 --> 47:00.093
Smile.

47:01.970 --> 47:03.763
- Yup.
- Yeah.

47:03.847 --> 47:06.391
- Wow.
- Keep it.

47:10.645 --> 47:14.608
- No, I couldn't take it. That's sweet, but...
- No, please.

47:16.151 --> 47:19.154
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, I want you to have it.

47:19.237 --> 47:22.991
- Can I pay you for it?
- No. No. No. No, my gift to you.

47:23.074 --> 47:24.868
Unless you want to play first base.

47:26.411 --> 47:29.039
But I figured probably not.

47:31.708 --> 47:33.043
Thank you.

47:36.254 --> 47:37.923
Okay, that's good.

47:38.673 --> 47:43.512
- See? Wasn't that helpful?
- I guess.

47:43.595 --> 47:45.514
Let's do some grounders.

47:45.597 --> 47:48.183
- What's a grounder?
- I'll show you. Throw it to me.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.602
Ready? Hands on your knees.

47:50.685 --> 47:55.524
When the ball comes, glove on the ground,
watch it into your glove. All right?

47:56.942 --> 47:58.443
There you go.

47:59.611 --> 48:01.112
How's Miss Cooper doing?

48:01.196 --> 48:03.782
My mom says she's gonna die soon.

48:04.991 --> 48:06.660
But I guess she's not suffering.

48:07.077 --> 48:09.204
I'm glad she's not suffering.

48:09.621 --> 48:11.831
She's definitely got a nice pool.

48:11.915 --> 48:16.836
Hey, what does it mean when it says,
"Make it easy to buy"?

48:16.920 --> 48:21.466
Well, it can mean a number of things,
getting rid of extra paperwork,

48:22.425 --> 48:26.054
displaying things in a way
that are appealing to people,

48:26.137 --> 48:28.306
explaining how products work.

48:28.390 --> 48:31.476
- You actually interested in that stuff?
- Yeah.

48:32.519 --> 48:34.688
If you read all that,
you'll know more than me.

48:37.232 --> 48:39.359
- What?
- Nothing.

48:39.901 --> 48:41.319
No, go ahead.

48:42.988 --> 48:44.531
Are we friends?

48:45.782 --> 48:48.368
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

48:49.661 --> 48:53.290
Remember when I told you
I tried out for the baseball team?

48:53.373 --> 48:54.499
Yeah.

48:56.876 --> 49:00.255
I lied. I don't play sports.

49:01.172 --> 49:02.340
Why not?

49:04.426 --> 49:07.846
- They make you change in the locker room.
- So?

49:08.722 --> 49:10.432
The other kids make jokes.

49:11.391 --> 49:12.809
What kind of jokes?

49:13.268 --> 49:14.519
They say,

49:15.812 --> 49:18.982
"You're so fat
you got shocks on your toilet seat."

49:19.065 --> 49:22.652
"You're so fat if your arm broke,
gravy would be coming out."

49:26.239 --> 49:27.282
That's mean.

49:28.491 --> 49:29.576
You heard this one?

49:30.285 --> 49:34.539
Your mama's so fat
she heard it was chilly out,

49:34.623 --> 49:37.000
she ran inside and got a bowl.

49:39.169 --> 49:42.631
Your mama's so fat
she has to shower at a car wash.

49:43.214 --> 49:46.801
Your mama's so fat she has 101% body fat.

49:46.885 --> 49:50.764
You mama's so fat
you have to roll her in flour

49:50.847 --> 49:52.390
then dive for the wet spot.

49:54.142 --> 49:55.477
Do you know what that means?

49:56.394 --> 49:57.437
No.

49:58.104 --> 50:00.148
Yeah, maybe don't tell that one.

50:00.940 --> 50:05.362
Kenny, look, you can't worry
about what other people think about you.

50:05.445 --> 50:06.738
You just got to fight back.

50:07.781 --> 50:09.282
Is that what you're doing?

50:09.366 --> 50:11.951
- What?
- Are you fighting back?

50:14.162 --> 50:15.997
Yeah, I'm fighting.

50:16.081 --> 50:17.874
Who are you fighting?

50:24.422 --> 50:26.925
Hi, Lynette. It's Nick.

50:28.968 --> 50:31.096
Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.099
Hey, Gary.

50:36.309 --> 50:38.895
I know. I know it was stupid. Yeah.

50:39.938 --> 50:43.441
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, I am an asshole.

50:45.276 --> 50:48.613
Yeah, Gary, I know. I know
it was fucking stupid to leave the knife.

50:50.073 --> 50:53.785
Yeah. Hey, Gary. Gary.

50:54.327 --> 50:55.870
Listen, why don't I come in?

50:55.954 --> 50:58.790
Why don't I come in
and we'll sit down and we'll talk about this?

50:58.873 --> 51:00.667
What? Gary?

51:02.293 --> 51:03.461
Gary!

52:16.534 --> 52:18.369
Hey, Kenny.

52:18.453 --> 52:21.331
Let's put this in the for sale pile.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.459
What about these books?

52:46.022 --> 52:47.232
Is that you?

52:48.733 --> 52:49.984
Yeah.

52:50.068 --> 52:51.736
You look happy.

52:52.487 --> 52:54.155
I was, I guess.

52:55.782 --> 52:56.866
What happened?

52:58.034 --> 52:59.994
What do you mean, what happened?

53:00.078 --> 53:01.579
Life happened.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.749
Work happened. Marriage happened.

53:10.588 --> 53:13.383
Hi, this is Nicholas Halsey.

53:13.758 --> 53:16.427
I went to high school
with your daughter Delilah.

53:17.136 --> 53:19.681
Thank you, ma'am. Yes. You, too.

53:23.935 --> 53:26.938
Listen, I'm on the high school
reunion committee.

53:27.021 --> 53:30.316
We're trying to get in touch with Delilah.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.447
Just wondering if you'd have an address

53:32.527 --> 53:36.155
or a phone number where I could
send her some information.

54:33.922 --> 54:36.925
Just a minute. Can I help you?

54:38.968 --> 54:41.054
- Delilah?
- Yeah.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.514
It's Nick.

54:45.183 --> 54:46.517
Nick Halsey.

54:47.602 --> 54:50.438
Nicholas. Wow.

54:50.855 --> 54:53.274
- God, hey.
- Hi.

54:53.358 --> 54:54.776
What are you doing here?

54:54.859 --> 54:58.571
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by.

55:00.323 --> 55:01.658
How'd you find me?

55:01.741 --> 55:04.744
I called your old number
and your mom gave me your address.

55:04.827 --> 55:06.746
- Okay.
- Yeah.

55:07.789 --> 55:10.208
- What a nice surprise.
- Yeah.

55:13.044 --> 55:16.381
I'm just getting some dinner
ready for my kids.

55:16.464 --> 55:18.257
Of course. I'm sorry.

55:18.341 --> 55:21.719
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to stop by and say hello.

55:25.723 --> 55:28.643
You know what?
I'm gonna give the kids dinner outside.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.521
And if you just wait,
I'm gonna bring the food out

55:31.604 --> 55:33.731
and you and I are gonna catch up, okay?

55:34.816 --> 55:35.817
- Great.
- Sound good?

55:35.900 --> 55:37.819
- Yeah.
- Okay. it's gonna be great.

55:37.902 --> 55:41.447
All right. Hey, you guys. Dinner outside.

55:42.407 --> 55:46.035
No, I actually went out to LA
to study acting.

55:46.119 --> 55:50.164
Yeah, I got a couple of decent jobs.
I got to do a IV commercial with Brad Pitt.

55:50.248 --> 55:53.001
- Really?
- It was fun.

55:53.084 --> 55:54.252
- Yeah.
- It was for Japan,

55:54.335 --> 55:57.505
so nobody here got to see it of course.

55:57.588 --> 56:01.342
It was cool.
We were in the desert at an old gas station.

56:01.426 --> 56:04.679
And there were tumbleweeds going by
and we're drinking beers,

56:04.762 --> 56:07.265
which, of course,
is why you could never see it in the US.

56:07.348 --> 56:11.352
- Sure.
- And these Japanese tourists pull up

56:11.436 --> 56:15.523
and they have one of those star maps
and they're asking directions.

56:15.606 --> 56:19.944
I mean, this sounds dumb
but I got to say, "Y'all look lost."

56:20.028 --> 56:23.740
And then Brad kind of smiles at them,
you know.

56:23.823 --> 56:27.994
And he takes the star map
and he points to his own house.

56:28.077 --> 56:29.829
I see.

56:29.912 --> 56:31.456
So, it was cool.

56:32.206 --> 56:33.708
He was a real sweetheart.

56:34.834 --> 56:37.211
What an experience.

56:37.295 --> 56:41.674
Then I had Lizzy and my husband left.

56:41.758 --> 56:44.302
So we came back here.

56:45.595 --> 56:50.850
And it's a good place for kids to grow up.
You know, it's safe.

56:53.978 --> 56:55.146
So what about you?

56:57.398 --> 57:01.652
- Are you married, or...
- Yes. Yes, I am.

57:02.320 --> 57:05.823
- And you have kids?
- No. We're...

57:07.658 --> 57:10.620
We're waiting for the right time, you know.

57:10.703 --> 57:12.371
There isn't one, trust me.

57:16.793 --> 57:18.878
Yeah, how do you handle all this?

57:19.504 --> 57:20.755
All What?

57:21.339 --> 57:22.548
The responsibility.

57:22.632 --> 57:26.010
You know, raising them by yourself,
supporting them.

57:28.888 --> 57:30.890
I don't really have a choice, right?

57:31.766 --> 57:36.562
My dad always said to me,
"Good without the bad ain't no good at all."

57:37.563 --> 57:40.358
So we just make it work, right, Missy?

57:43.694 --> 57:45.238
You're a natural.

57:48.116 --> 57:49.158
Hi.

57:53.871 --> 57:56.040
- Wow, it was great to see you.
- Yeah. You, too.

58:07.552 --> 58:09.720
Is there something else
you wanted to say to me?

58:13.558 --> 58:14.892
I'm sorry.

58:19.272 --> 58:21.649
But when we were in high school,

58:23.234 --> 58:24.443
you wrote this.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.865
Oh, my gosh. Look at us.

58:32.743 --> 58:34.328
"You're a diamond in the rough."

58:34.412 --> 58:36.497
That was 20 years ago.

58:36.581 --> 58:37.999
I know.

58:38.583 --> 58:41.252
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

58:41.335 --> 58:43.129
It's stupid.

58:43.212 --> 58:48.968
Hey. No, I mean, we weren't really friends.

58:49.051 --> 58:52.513
Exactly. It's stupid. I'm so sorry.

58:54.265 --> 58:56.475
It was really great to see you.

58:58.603 --> 59:04.400
Hey, you remember those crazy parties
at Brian Sever's house?

59:04.942 --> 59:08.821
Yeah. Well, I showed up
with bright pink hair once

59:08.905 --> 59:10.323
'cause I was going through a phase.

59:11.908 --> 59:14.744
And the guys were super drunk,
especially Brian.

59:15.786 --> 59:20.958
And he decided he was gonna try to
dunk my hair in the pool to get the pink out.

59:21.751 --> 59:24.170
And everybody just thought
that was super funny.

59:24.253 --> 59:26.797
I was really embarrassed and scared.

59:26.881 --> 59:30.635
And you came over and tried to stop him.

59:31.052 --> 59:35.473
And he wouldn't, so you punched him
and knocked him into the pool.

59:36.474 --> 59:41.312
Then you gave me a ride home
while your girlfriend hung out at the party.

59:44.315 --> 59:45.650
Don't you remember that?

59:47.276 --> 59:48.319
No.

59:50.905 --> 59:52.281
Well, I do.

59:56.619 --> 01:00:01.165
You have a good heart, Nicholas.
That doesn't change.

01:00:07.588 --> 01:00:11.092
So when you get yourself together,

01:00:11.884 --> 01:00:15.513
you should call me
and we'll go have some coffee.

01:00:16.305 --> 01:00:17.390
Sure.

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:24.605
Nicholas, are you gonna be all right?

01:00:25.064 --> 01:00:26.941
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:31.529
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

01:00:31.612 --> 01:00:33.114
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:34.282
- That's all?
- That's it.

01:00:34.365 --> 01:00:36.409
- $6.50, man.
- Yeah, I don't have $6.50.

01:00:36.492 --> 01:00:38.160
Can I just get this?

01:00:38.244 --> 01:00:39.957
I can't do credit on this, man.
You know that.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:41.247
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:42.960
- On a six-pack?
- You're here all the time.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.671
I know, I've been coming here all the time.
So can you just spot me?

01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:48.337
Not at all, man.
I'll lose my job. I can't do that.

01:00:48.421 --> 01:00:50.506
- Can you just give me one beer?
- No, not even one

01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:53.012
- 'cause it's a whole case right here.
- You being serious right now?

01:00:53.092 --> 01:00:55.761
- I'm being serious right now.
- Really? For real?

01:00:55.845 --> 01:00:57.763
Can't you just tell?

01:00:58.431 --> 01:01:00.683
I should fucking call the cops
on your ass for that.

01:01:00.766 --> 01:01:03.144
You better leave. Yeah, run.

01:01:12.486 --> 01:01:16.615
Hey, I don't mean to bother you,
but can I get a beer from you?

01:01:16.699 --> 01:01:19.076
Can I get one of your beers?

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.146
I just need a drink.

01:02:33.526 --> 01:02:34.777
These are Valium.

01:02:35.945 --> 01:02:37.405
They'll help.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.600
You feeling any better?

01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:09.854
Thanks.

01:03:23.826 --> 01:03:26.078
You know, you need some help.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.583
I've tried help.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:34.545
Yeah, well, maybe it wasn't the right kind.

01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:39.383
You know, there's new medications,
new therapies.

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:42.136
I don't need medication.

01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:45.973
Well, you can't live like this.

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:51.020
Why not?

01:03:52.646 --> 01:03:54.565
'Cause it's not normal.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.568
Normal?

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:02.239
What's normal?

01:04:02.948 --> 01:04:06.410
That guy Stanley what's-his-name,
down in the blue house,

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.331
his wife blew her brains out last month

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:13.334
'cause her daughter
didn't make cheerleading.

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:17.463
Kenny practically lives by himself,
you know?

01:04:17.546 --> 01:04:21.091
Elliot and Kitty,
I can't even tell you what they do.

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:27.806
I'm no different than any of you.
I just don't hide in my house, okay?

01:04:28.724 --> 01:04:31.018
- What does that mean?
- What?

01:04:32.895 --> 01:04:34.230
"Any of you."

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:39.485
Nothing. Nothing. I'm just saying...

01:04:39.568 --> 01:04:43.072
No, you said "any of you."

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.575
Never mind.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:51.455
No, go on. I'm a big girl. Say it.

01:04:51.914 --> 01:04:53.499
I don't want to do this right now.

01:04:53.582 --> 01:04:54.959
Say it.

01:05:00.881 --> 01:05:02.883
What's his name?

01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:06.762
- Who?
- Your husband. John? Jeff?

01:05:06.845 --> 01:05:08.347
- Jack.
- Jack.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:14.395
He started out in a regional office, right?

01:05:15.062 --> 01:05:16.105
Yeah.

01:05:16.689 --> 01:05:20.150
He impressed some people
who moved him up to the big leagues.

01:05:20.234 --> 01:05:22.403
- How many years?
- Two.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.321
Two years? Yeah.

01:05:25.114 --> 01:05:27.491
Now he's back at the regionals.

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:33.497
You're sacrificing your promising career
as a photographer for him.

01:05:34.123 --> 01:05:35.165
So?

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:38.836
I figured you out in five minutes.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:42.006
He drinks.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.052
They transferred him out here
'cause he fucked something up.

01:05:48.762 --> 01:05:51.002
You probably thought
it was a good idea to come out here.

01:05:51.473 --> 01:05:54.435
Might even save your marriage.

01:05:55.102 --> 01:05:56.687
For better or for worse, right?

01:05:58.314 --> 01:05:59.481
Right.

01:06:00.983 --> 01:06:02.234
I just want to know one thing.

01:06:02.818 --> 01:06:05.070
What kind of man lets his wife,

01:06:05.154 --> 01:06:09.450
his pregnant wife,
move alone across the country?

01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:13.203
And what kind of woman
stays with a man like that?

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:19.001
What kind of woman?
What, so it's my fault?

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:25.257
You must be really good at your job,
you know, just reading people so easily,

01:06:25.341 --> 01:06:28.385
figuring out what bullshit to sell 'em.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.722
- Hey.
- God, what?

01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:38.312
You need to put up some curtains.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:41.899
Why? So I don't have some drunk
staring at me all day?

01:06:43.025 --> 01:06:46.737
No, so you don't have to look at your future.

01:06:49.323 --> 01:06:50.407
Jeez.

01:06:54.453 --> 01:06:57.039
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:08:17.995 --> 01:08:21.081
"Light up your life. Stop living in the dark."

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.840
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:30.924 --> 01:08:34.219
- How long have you been here?
- A couple of hours.

01:08:36.555 --> 01:08:39.558
Where did the tables come from?

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.143
- The tables?
- Yeah.

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:43.312
Your neighbor Elliot.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:45.939
You got price tags on everything.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:49.651
How'd you do that?

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:53.988
Market research.
I'm making it easy for the customer.

01:08:56.783 --> 01:08:59.620
- Nice work, Kenny.
- Thanks.

01:09:01.913 --> 01:09:03.540
Really nice work.

01:09:22.768 --> 01:09:26.313
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey. Good. Good.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:29.649
Just thought I'd stop by a little,
check up on you.

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:30.734
Thanks.

01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:34.238
So you're letting some of this stuff go, huh?

01:09:34.321 --> 01:09:39.993
Yeah. I'm gonna sell it,
you know, everything I can.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:44.081
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thanks.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:47.501
Yeah, Catherine, we can...

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:49.752
I can work this out.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.465
This is a good first step. It is.

01:09:55.008 --> 01:09:57.511
Why don't you stop by the station
when you're done?

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:01.431
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

01:10:03.934 --> 01:10:06.603
- Thanks for stopping by.
- No problem.

01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:25.080
Excuse me. How much for the chair?

01:10:25.163 --> 01:10:27.291
- The chair?
- Yeah.

01:10:27.374 --> 01:10:31.962
- $2 and I'll throw in the macramÃ©.
- All right.

01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:34.548
Thank you.

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:36.425
That actually works.

01:10:36.508 --> 01:10:38.051
Same taste in tapes, man.

01:10:41.388 --> 01:10:43.891
That's right, throw it on the grill there.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:46.184
You ever fish the lower Salt?

01:10:46.268 --> 01:10:47.769
No.

01:10:47.853 --> 01:10:51.356
At sunset with the water like glass,
it's religious.

01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:53.400
Sounds nice.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:57.738
I'm sorry, I've never fished the lower Salt.
I've never even gone fishing before.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.823
I've never been fishing in all my life.

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:02.159
- That looks really good on him.
- Yeah, isn't it cute?

01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:04.578
Really cute. Old school.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:07.331
- I'm not sure.
- Your girlfriend is.

01:11:09.124 --> 01:11:11.251
All I know is I bought this for $125.

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:13.629
I'm not gonna do $125.

01:11:13.712 --> 01:11:15.297
- I'm not asking you to.
- Okay.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.674
- I'm asking $25.
- I'll do $15.

01:11:17.758 --> 01:11:19.968
- What about $22?
- $20.

01:11:21.595 --> 01:11:23.513
- $217
- Okay.

01:11:23.597 --> 01:11:27.392
- How much is this?
- $10.

01:11:27.809 --> 01:11:30.812
Hey, that should be $15.
I got engaged in that suit.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.607
I saw you checking out the blender.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.692
I could do both for $25.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.158
All right, deal.

01:11:43.241 --> 01:11:47.955
Rule number one, always have power
so people can test appliances.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:49.790
That's a good rule.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.797
Hey, just wanted you to know
everything's going pretty good.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.301
And I'm selling it, all my stuff.

01:12:02.135 --> 01:12:06.264
All my crap. And it feels pretty good.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:10.477
I'm getting rid of everything, Catherine.

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:14.398
Anyway, call me when you're ready.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.859
On Kitty's phone, I guess.

01:12:19.486 --> 01:12:22.572
I miss you. Bye.

01:12:23.657 --> 01:12:26.785
Made in China, even though
it's supposed to be Japanese, so...

01:12:26.868 --> 01:12:28.996
You know What? I'll give it to you for $25.

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:32.374
And I'll throw in this wolf and polar bear.

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:34.918
Okay, let's show 'em, ladies.

01:12:37.337 --> 01:12:41.675
Hustlers. You're all hustlers.
You hustled me.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:44.678
All right, another hand like that
and I'll be buying the table from you.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.680
Who's deal? Sherry, your deal?

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:49.433
- All right.
- Right here. Here we go.

01:12:49.516 --> 01:12:50.796
Yeah, you don't have to shuffle.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.146
So, yeah, you can cook anything on it.

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:56.815
You can cook hot dogs.
You can cook bacon.

01:12:56.898 --> 01:12:58.191
You can cook burritos.

01:12:58.275 --> 01:13:00.360
- Who's in first?
- I'm in for $10.

01:13:00.444 --> 01:13:02.446
- $10'?
- I'm in for $15.

01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:06.074
- $15'?
- I'm in for $15 as well.

01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:08.076
Okay, that's already too rich for my blood.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.374
- I don't have that kind of money.
- You want to borrow a chip?

01:13:10.454 --> 01:13:13.874
You know what?
I'm all in, plus the cat ashtray.

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.543
Okay?

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:18.003
- Yours sticks.
- Yeah.

01:13:18.086 --> 01:13:20.326
- That's good luck.
- The high-level players can do this.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.966
- How we looking?
- Take a look.

01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:25.218
Okay, good.

01:13:25.302 --> 01:13:27.220
I can't hardly even find this stuff anymore.

01:13:27.304 --> 01:13:29.639
- How much for these?
- I'm sorry. They're not for sale.

01:13:30.432 --> 01:13:32.225
Come on, man. What do you want for 'em?

01:13:32.309 --> 01:13:35.228
- No, no, I really can't.
- Seriously?

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:38.607
I think you'll be happy with either.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:40.817
- What do you think, green or blue?
- Go with blue.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.072
All right, thank you very much.

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:46.615
How's that mouthwash treating you?

01:13:47.908 --> 01:13:49.534
How much for the chair?

01:13:51.036 --> 01:13:52.662
Can I ask why you want it?

01:13:53.163 --> 01:13:54.498
I need a new chair.

01:13:55.582 --> 01:13:56.750
What happened to the old one?

01:13:57.375 --> 01:14:02.130
I got a new color IV over at a sale in Gilbert.
I need a new chair.

01:14:04.382 --> 01:14:06.176
You know what? Why don't you take it?

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.180
I want you to have it.

01:14:20.816 --> 01:14:21.900
Yeah.

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:52.597
Samantha?

01:14:53.849 --> 01:14:56.726
Please, I know you're in there.

01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:21.793
Nice house.

01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:29.259
I just wanted to apologize for last night.

01:15:31.303 --> 01:15:34.931
No, look, really, it's fine.
I shouldn't have pushed.

01:15:35.724 --> 01:15:38.018
I don't know you.
I don't know your husband.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:41.479
Yeah, well, I called him last night.

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:45.692
I told him I was going to leave him.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:49.196
He said he was coming tomorrow.

01:15:50.363 --> 01:15:53.033
So you're right.

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.702
Maybe you don't know people
so well after all.

01:15:58.997 --> 01:16:00.373
Are you gonna go back to New York?

01:16:03.084 --> 01:16:04.961
I don't know.

01:16:08.256 --> 01:16:09.341
Well,

01:16:10.842 --> 01:16:15.096
I don't think it's right
to make a decision like that

01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:19.809
without having authentic Mexican food.

01:16:20.393 --> 01:16:23.772
Have you had an authentic Mexican meal
in Arizona?

01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:25.774
No.

01:16:27.567 --> 01:16:32.405
Well, Kenny and I, we're gonna go celebrate.
He's buying.

01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:34.699
So...

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:39.246
Sounds nice.

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:40.830
Great. Good.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.751
'Cause we need a ride anyway.

01:16:46.294 --> 01:16:47.462
Of course.

01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:58.515
- Lively.
- He likes it.

01:16:59.724 --> 01:17:02.269
Maybe. Or really doesn't like it.

01:17:03.603 --> 01:17:05.981
- Are you ready for him?
- Yes.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.191
No.

01:17:09.985 --> 01:17:13.029
I can't figure out what color to paint
the baby's room.

01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:18.535
I don't know why,
but somehow it seems really important.

01:17:19.244 --> 01:17:23.373
It is important.
Every color has a specific effect on people.

01:17:23.456 --> 01:17:26.960
What are you thinking?
Come on, it's what I do for a living.

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.255
You pick colors for a living?

01:17:30.797 --> 01:17:33.091
No, I pick colors to make people buy things.

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:39.472
- I like yellow.
- That makes people anxious.

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:43.518
- Yeah.
- That's not good.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.395
How about blue?

01:17:46.354 --> 01:17:50.900
- Blue is soothing. Color of communication.
- That's good.

01:17:50.984 --> 01:17:54.404
Yeah. Green is good, also.

01:17:55.822 --> 01:17:59.117
Well, then I guess it's blue.

01:18:01.328 --> 01:18:02.912
Or green.

01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:09.252
Here's to blue or green.

01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:12.380
To blue or green.

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.434
Nick.

01:18:25.393 --> 01:18:26.436
Wow.

01:18:27.187 --> 01:18:29.272
What brings you downtown?

01:18:30.607 --> 01:18:33.360
Dinner with friends. You?

01:18:34.736 --> 01:18:37.781
Drinks with the boys from the office.

01:18:37.864 --> 01:18:39.491
How's everything at work?

01:18:39.574 --> 01:18:43.620
Things are good. They're good.
Nothing new, really.

01:18:43.703 --> 01:18:45.372
We filled your position.

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:49.167
Yeah, some kid
straight out of business school.

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:54.297
He's good. He's not as good as you,
but he's young and he's cheap.

01:18:54.923 --> 01:18:56.091
Right.

01:18:56.174 --> 01:18:58.385
Pretty good ballplayer, too,
from what I understand.

01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:01.221
Think he even played in the Minors.

01:19:03.431 --> 01:19:05.642
They got rid of that Sharon girl.

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:07.560
Really?

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:11.064
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it turns out she threatened to sue

01:19:11.147 --> 01:19:13.316
two other guys at her last job at Kittredge.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.443
Total bullshit.

01:19:16.778 --> 01:19:19.614
Wow, kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

01:19:20.532 --> 01:19:24.285
If you hadn't stabbed my Mustang,
probably could've gotten your job back.

01:19:26.663 --> 01:19:29.332
Sued for wrongful termination, even.

01:19:31.626 --> 01:19:34.337
Yeah. Well, I'll see you around, man.

01:19:48.268 --> 01:19:50.854
It's the kind of thing you kind of feel like
you want to touch,

01:19:50.937 --> 01:19:53.189
but you're not really sure.

01:19:53.273 --> 01:19:55.150
Think you forgot that.

01:20:00.864 --> 01:20:03.324
Hey, can you drop me off somewhere?

01:20:04.117 --> 01:20:06.244
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks.

01:20:06.911 --> 01:20:07.996
Where are you going?

01:20:08.079 --> 01:20:11.374
That's none of your business
where I'm going.

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:13.042
I'm a grown man.

01:20:23.887 --> 01:20:25.555
I'll buzz you in.

01:20:27.974 --> 01:20:30.477
- Glad you had the time.
- Yeah, I know.

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:34.314
- Just ate at that place over on 60th.
- Yeah?

01:20:35.315 --> 01:20:36.733
And the sale?

01:20:36.816 --> 01:20:39.319
- Great.
- Good. So listen,

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:41.157
- I've got to check up on a statement.
- Okay.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:43.990
- You good? Want anything to drink?
- No, I'm good. Yeah.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:47.827
- I'm glad you're here.
- Good to be here. Thanks.

01:21:15.772 --> 01:21:19.150
Frank? Frank, it's Catherine.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.154
I'm back at your place.

01:21:23.238 --> 01:21:25.615
Call me back if you can hear me.

01:21:25.698 --> 01:21:27.909
Frank? Frank, are you...

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.681
Can I stay at your house tonight?

01:21:51.766 --> 01:21:53.643
Why don't I just get you a hotel room?

01:21:56.563 --> 01:21:58.815
No, I think it would be better
if I stayed with you.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.027
Well, you know you can't do that.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.995
She didn't have anywhere to go.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.497
She could have stayed with her sister.

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:18.626
She wanted a drink, so she came to me, bud.

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:24.257
She came to me. I'm sorry.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.050
We always joked about this, you know?

01:22:26.134 --> 01:22:28.595
- Yeah? What?
- Yeah, the 13th step.

01:22:28.678 --> 01:22:30.930
- Come on, man.
- First you teach them the 12 steps.

01:22:31.014 --> 01:22:33.057
Then you get them into bed for the 13th.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:35.685
It wasn't like that, bud.

01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:39.105
She came to me for help.

01:22:41.566 --> 01:22:44.694
- Look, I'm sorry. I...
- Shut up, Frank!

01:22:46.446 --> 01:22:50.950
Look, let's go get some coffee and talk.

01:23:00.168 --> 01:23:03.880
She deserves better, you piece of shit.
She deserves better.

01:23:03.963 --> 01:23:05.965
Okay. Okay. No. No. No.

01:23:07.592 --> 01:23:10.303
- I got it.
- You all right? Stay there.

01:23:19.771 --> 01:23:21.442
Do you know the success rate for a marriage

01:23:21.522 --> 01:23:24.651
when one person gets sober
and the other one doesn't'?

01:23:25.693 --> 01:23:29.364
Is it higher than the suicide rate for cops?

01:23:29.906 --> 01:23:31.658
It's almost zero.

01:23:32.742 --> 01:23:37.497
I know this because I go to the meetings.
I do the work.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.166
You know, she came to me
about six months ago.

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:42.502
I told her to leave you.

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:46.214
But she wanted to give you another chance,
said she still loved you.

01:23:46.297 --> 01:23:48.966
But then you go out and you get drunk

01:23:49.717 --> 01:23:51.177
and you have sex with another woman.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.473
I mean, it would be perfect
if it wasn't so damn sad.

01:23:58.393 --> 01:24:00.395
Can I ask you a question?

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:03.231
How long since you guys slept together?

01:24:05.858 --> 01:24:08.569
How long since you asked
her if she was happy?

01:24:08.653 --> 01:24:10.405
You know what? Stop the car.

01:24:10.863 --> 01:24:14.075
- Let me just take you home.
- No, just pull over.

01:24:27.922 --> 01:24:29.966
Catherine wants a divorce.

01:24:32.885 --> 01:24:35.138
And she wants the house, too.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.895
I was gonna tell you tonight.

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.399
Here are the papers.

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:51.821
The keys to the house are inside.
There's some spending money in there.

01:24:59.912 --> 01:25:01.664
She wants to keep it amicable.

01:25:02.373 --> 01:25:05.084
So just sign the papers
and you'll get your share.

01:25:10.965 --> 01:25:14.969
I want you to know that Cate and I,
we haven't given up on you.

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:18.681
If you want a new sponsor,
I could recommend somebody.

01:25:25.938 --> 01:25:27.315
Frank...

01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:37.366
Tell my wife I'm sorry.

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:38.673
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:40.299
So how are you doing?

01:28:41.968 --> 01:28:43.052
Fine.

01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:45.972
Here.

01:28:48.641 --> 01:28:50.726
- What's this?
- The money we made.

01:28:53.854 --> 01:28:56.857
I plugged the record player in
in case you wanted to listen to music.

01:29:00.069 --> 01:29:01.570
Nice job, Kenny.

01:29:06.242 --> 01:29:07.284
There's your take.

01:29:09.912 --> 01:29:12.248
- This is too much.
- Take it.

01:29:12.957 --> 01:29:15.167
I was skimming your profits for beer money.

01:29:16.502 --> 01:29:20.589
Rule number 17,
never go into business with a friend.

01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:24.677
Thanks.

01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:30.307
So I guess I'll see you around.

01:29:33.185 --> 01:29:34.437
Yeah.

01:29:37.064 --> 01:29:40.109
Maybe we can catch a game sometime.

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:46.615
Been a pleasure working with you.

01:29:51.829 --> 01:29:53.456
You, too.
