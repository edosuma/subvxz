00:01.468 --> 00:02.468
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.470 --> 00:03.736
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:06.338
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:09.208
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:11.210
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:13.545
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:15.215 --> 00:18.150
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.619
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:23.155
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.791
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:28.727
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:28.729 --> 00:31.764
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:31.766 --> 00:35.034
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:38.570
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:40.739
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:40.741 --> 00:42.408
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:42.410 --> 00:45.177
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:49.482 --> 00:51.817
â™ª

01:20.713 --> 01:23.515
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:23.517 --> 01:26.151
My wife and I found the body
when we were hiking off trail.

01:26.153 --> 01:29.321
Our dog, stella, was actually
the one who sniffed it out.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.465
Based on the
cold temperatures

01:39.467 --> 01:41.333
And the blowfly colonization,
I'd say she's been out here

01:41.335 --> 01:43.402
A while.
Maybe a month or so.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.670
Highway's
just up ahead.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.371
Could be a
body dump.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.412
Sifter:
According to dental records,

01:53.414 --> 01:56.181
Her name is elizabeth marks
from syracuse, new york.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.716
Age 20.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.184
Went missing
two years ago.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.819
How did she end up
in the cyber division?

02:00.821 --> 02:01.854
Ever hear the saying

02:01.856 --> 02:03.755
"dead men tell no tales"?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.791
Well, dead women
don't do updates.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.726
Elizabeth marks
has been deceased

02:07.728 --> 02:09.328
For at least a month or two,

02:09.330 --> 02:11.730
But her friendagenda page
is still being updated

02:11.732 --> 02:13.532
As we speak.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.835
Her most recent post...
Uh, about an hour ago.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.537
"we just bought
a flat together

02:18.539 --> 02:19.872
"outside of paris.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.473
"can't wait to nest

02:21.475 --> 02:22.741
"and maybe pump out some babies.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.177
Oui! Oui!"

02:25.179 --> 02:26.578
Where's the missing
person's report?

02:26.580 --> 02:29.481
Her parents never
declared her missing.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.483
I just got off the phone
with them.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.885
Now, to hear them tell it,
they were convinced

02:32.887 --> 02:35.587
Elizabeth just... Ran off.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.892
Ryan:
According to
elizabeth marks' parents,

02:39.894 --> 02:41.493
They never had
a close relationship.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.262
Elizabeth
stopped contacting them

02:43.264 --> 02:44.596
A little over two years ago.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.765
Now, I want to read
her friendagenda posts

02:46.767 --> 02:49.234
From before the abduction,
so let's go back

02:49.236 --> 02:51.803
Two and a half years.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.739
Krumitz:
Here you go.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.741
Elizabeth marks says,
"I hate when men..."

03:01.781 --> 03:03.382
Let me see another one
from that same time--

03:03.384 --> 03:05.417
Two and a half
years ago.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.189
"okay, I am convinced
I am cursed."

03:20.200 --> 03:22.534
But now fast-forward
to after the abduction.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.735
More recent posts.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.804
I want to see
if the language changes.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.740
"hooray!"

03:34.280 --> 03:36.381
Now let's see her latest post.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.384
"hip, hip, hooray!"

03:47.961 --> 03:50.829
So whoever's updating
her friendagenda account

03:50.831 --> 03:52.965
Has definitely
changed the language

03:52.967 --> 03:54.333
From negative
to positive.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.567
Positive
language paints

03:55.569 --> 03:57.269
The picture of a brand-new life.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.705
Why abduct a girl and keep her
alive on her social network?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.573
To throw the dogs off the scent.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.309
Look, all the messaging
post-abduction basically says,

04:04.311 --> 04:05.844
"I am no longer
available to you."

04:05.846 --> 04:06.979
The target knows that
no law enforcement's

04:06.981 --> 04:08.280
Going to track elizabeth

04:08.282 --> 04:11.783
This tactic keeps everybody
who cares about her away.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.819
Well, it worked.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.020
Elizabeth marks' parents

04:15.022 --> 04:16.321
Believed that she
left for good.

04:16.323 --> 04:17.389
Ryan:
We don't believe it.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.857
Now whoever's behind this

04:18.859 --> 04:20.525
Is gonna have to deal with us.
(phone ringing)

04:22.795 --> 04:23.795
Mundo.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.397
Great.
Be right there.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.400
A, dr. Ortega has
elizabeth marks' body uploaded.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.004
Thought you might
want to see this.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.772
Isolate chest
of elizabeth marks.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.408
Multiple stab wounds,

04:36.410 --> 04:37.943
Seven in total.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.745
Reload marks again.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.480
Isolate wrists

04:41.482 --> 04:44.016
And ankles.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.351
Woven bone.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.754
The bumpy texture in the
soft tissue and muscle

04:48.756 --> 04:50.622
Means that she was restrained
for quite some time.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.524
Saw this all the time with pows.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.859
Okay, based on the bone growth,

04:53.861 --> 04:55.560
How long do you think
she was held

04:55.562 --> 04:57.396
Against her will?
Mundo:
Well, I mean,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.430
She was missing for 24 months...

04:58.432 --> 04:59.431
Dead one,
two months...

04:59.433 --> 05:00.565
Mundo:
I mean, I'd say

05:00.567 --> 05:02.534
18 months?
That sounds
about right.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.970
That's just the beginning.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.672
Reload marks.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.774
Isolate
lower back.

05:08.776 --> 05:12.544
I also thought you two
should take a look at this.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.712
What is that?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.447
Ryan:
Well, the tattoo's crude.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.416
It's not the work
of a professional.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.917
Maybe the target
assigned her a number.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.852
Why are two of
the three numbers crossed out?

05:20.854 --> 05:23.021
Ryan:
The seven and six
are crossed out.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.324
Could be a numerical progression
of some sort.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.925
Maybe a ranking system.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.094
The nature of this
type of marking

05:29.096 --> 05:32.698
Is it's the target's way
of branding her his own.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.865
What are we looking at here, a?

05:33.867 --> 05:36.568
Abduction is about possession.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.837
An abductor's sole mission

05:38.839 --> 05:40.772
Is to protect what he possesses.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.574
The target didn't
intend to kill her.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.077
And because he dumped
her body in the woods

05:45.079 --> 05:46.411
Like a piece of trash,

05:46.413 --> 05:48.480
You can be certain

05:48.482 --> 05:50.549
He will replace her
with another girl.

05:55.355 --> 06:01.593
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

06:03.463 --> 06:09.101
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

06:09.103 --> 06:13.438
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

06:13.440 --> 06:16.708
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

06:16.710 --> 06:21.146
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

06:21.148 --> 06:24.716
â™ª and miles...

06:24.718 --> 06:27.052
â™ª oh, yeah.

06:41.501 --> 06:42.567
â™ª

06:43.903 --> 06:45.637
Have krumitz pull all the intel

06:45.639 --> 06:47.539
For all the missing women
in new york state

06:47.541 --> 06:49.007
In the past
three months.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.642
I want to see if anyone
turns up matching

06:50.644 --> 06:53.044
The same physical description
as elizabeth marks.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.513
Behaviorally,

06:54.515 --> 06:56.415
Abductors stick
to the same type.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.416
(phone ringing)

06:57.418 --> 06:58.683
Hello.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.085
Woman (on phone):
I-I can't take it anymore!

07:00.087 --> 07:01.953
I-I'm telling you,
I can't sleep at night

07:01.955 --> 07:04.456
When she's out there
in the cold!

07:04.458 --> 07:05.791
I'm gonna... I'm gonna do it

07:05.793 --> 07:06.925
If it takes all night.
Trish...

07:06.927 --> 07:08.660
Trish, where are you?

07:10.129 --> 07:11.163
You okay?

07:11.165 --> 07:13.165
Uh, personal issues.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.733
I'll-I'll catch up
with you.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.501
Take your time.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.804
Trish, it's me.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.572
Call me back on my cell phone.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.708
We need to speak before you do
anything you're going to regret.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.477
You understand?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.645
(sighs)

07:26.647 --> 07:27.712
Bye.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.788
Okay, guys, we have our work
cut out for us on this one.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.924
Search for all women
reported missing

07:38.926 --> 07:40.058
In the state of new york

07:40.060 --> 07:41.126
In the last three months.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.930
In the state of new york,
over the past three months,

07:44.932 --> 07:47.866
187 women have gone missing.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.201
Krumitz, pull up
the high school picture

07:49.203 --> 07:50.802
Of elizabeth marks, please.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.205
Abductors tend to
abduct close to type,

07:53.207 --> 07:54.840
So input the following prompts:

07:54.842 --> 07:55.907
Caucasian.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.712
Krumitz:
Uh, 187 goes down

08:00.714 --> 08:02.113
To 103 caucasian women.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.516
Isolate those under 21.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.987
68 caucasian women
under the age of 21.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.023
Isolate those
with brown hair.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.593
Nelson:
36 women left.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.796
All with dark hair,
under the age of 21.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.998
How tall was elizabeth marks?
Um...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.901
Five-foot-two.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.538
Down to eight.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.774
What color were her eyes?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.017
Mundo:
Five-foot-two,

08:39.019 --> 08:41.286
Eyes of blue...

08:41.288 --> 08:44.289
Just like the song.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.124
("five foot two, eyes of blue"
by art landry playing)

08:46.126 --> 08:48.026
â™ª five-foot-two, eyes of blue

08:48.028 --> 08:49.961
â™ª but, oh, what those
five foot could do â™ª

08:49.963 --> 08:54.566
â™ª has anybody seen my gal?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.301
â™ª turned up nose,
turned down hose â™ª

08:56.303 --> 08:58.637
â™ª flapper, yes, sir,
one of those â™ª

08:58.639 --> 09:01.806
â™ª has anybody seen my gal?

09:01.808 --> 09:04.175
You know, I don't think
art landry's 1925 hit song

09:04.177 --> 09:06.177
Was ever meant to be
the abductor's anthem,

09:06.179 --> 09:08.780
But 90 years later,
"five-foot-two, eyes of blue"

09:08.782 --> 09:11.182
Is still the physical preference
for sexual predators.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.985
That has been the lore
of the bureau for years.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.221
Well, unfortunately, in our
place the lyrics still apply.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.322
Only this time, it's plural.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.091
"has anybody seen my gals?"

09:20.093 --> 09:22.060
Well, according to
their friendagenda pages,

09:22.062 --> 09:24.663
Missy bowers is the only one
that updated after disappearing.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.164
Unlike elizabeth marks' parents,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.233
Missy bowers' mother did file
a missing person's report

09:28.235 --> 09:30.335
And she is not buying
those bogus updates.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.972
"I'm off to switzerland to start
a new life with my new man."

09:36.976 --> 09:38.176
This fits the m.O.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.611
Where's missy from?

09:40.279 --> 09:41.746
Lake placid.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.354
Yeah, I knew in my gut

09:49.356 --> 09:50.956
That those updates
were phony bologna.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.159
She didn't run off to
switzerland w-with some guy.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.027
For all I know, she didn't
even have a passport.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.228
Well, that's why we're here.

09:57.230 --> 10:01.933
Now, she's a freshman
in college, correct?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.969
She lives with me and
she's a full-time student.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.303
Did she leave her computer here?
Yeah.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.105
Uh, a laptop.
It's up in her bedroom.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.640
Do you know
her password?

10:08.642 --> 10:12.143
Missy was very protective
about her computer.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.179
She was always doing this...
Online dating stuff.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.848
Like most
18-year-olds,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.917
She doesn't want me
in her personal business.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.385
Online dating?
Do you know which site?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.286
No, I...

10:21.288 --> 10:23.388
Why?
Is...

10:23.390 --> 10:25.256
Does this have something
to do with that?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.025
We're still trying
to find that out.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.059
Ryan:
Mrs. Bowers?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.628
Based on evidence we found

10:29.630 --> 10:31.229
On another victim,

10:31.231 --> 10:34.799
We think missy may be
being held against her will.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.136
"against her will"? Wha...?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.338
By who?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.307
By some sicko?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.142
I can't...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.277
I can't talk about this anymore.
I'm sorry!

10:46.279 --> 10:48.913
I think I'm gonna be sick!

10:53.019 --> 10:54.419
(knocking)

10:54.421 --> 10:55.720
Ryan:
<i>Mrs. Bowers?</i>

11:05.398 --> 11:08.166
Mrs. Bowers?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.902
We're gonna do everything
we can to bring missy home.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.371
Please, don't give me
false hope, mrs. Ryan.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.740
It's not false hope.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.976
I know the idea of a stranger
holding your daughter

11:17.978 --> 11:20.311
Against her will is grim.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.181
But missy

11:23.183 --> 11:25.183
Is worth more to him

11:25.185 --> 11:27.952
Alive than dead.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.155
And as long
as that's the case,

11:30.157 --> 11:32.824
We have a good chance
of bringing her home...

11:32.826 --> 11:35.026
Alive.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.698
Why do you care so much?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.767
You must see this
stuff every day.

11:42.769 --> 11:46.271
And then here you are on
the floor of my bathroom.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.949
I lost someone...

11:57.951 --> 12:01.252
Very close to me.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.388
She was murdered.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.960
But you know what gets me up
off the floor?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.929
This.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.298
The idea of bringing
a daughter back home

12:13.300 --> 12:15.033
To her mother.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.069
I play that

12:18.071 --> 12:20.071
Over and over in my head

12:20.073 --> 12:22.240
Till it comes true.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.508
(short laugh)

12:23.510 --> 12:26.978
That's why I do what I do

12:26.980 --> 12:28.379
Every day.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.250
By healing you...

12:32.252 --> 12:34.385
I heal me.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.857
Now, my job...

12:38.859 --> 12:41.993
Is to stand up for missy.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.262
And so is yours.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.397
Yeah.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.081
Missy bowers' hard drive?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.083
Yup, clone and own.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.485
Check her history.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.020
(slurping)

13:11.157 --> 13:12.490
Mmm.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.992
Damn, slurpy!

13:13.994 --> 13:15.360
Have you heard yourself?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.895
Should've put you
in that commercial.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.297
Licks do it take till
you get to the center?"

13:19.299 --> 13:22.333
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:22.335 --> 13:25.103
Truelovewaiting.Com.
It's a dating site.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.105
Start off with lunch,
and then you work
your way up to marriage.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.339
Yeah, you think she
went on there enough?

13:28.341 --> 13:29.841
Her whole history
window's filled.

13:29.843 --> 13:30.975
Mm-hmm.
Move over.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.277
Let me get in there.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.511
Hmm.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.048
Gentlesurgeon1 is
looking for friendship

13:37.050 --> 13:38.917
And ultimately a wife.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.052
Yeah, and as long
as we have a 2703 warrant,

13:41.054 --> 13:43.054
We have full access to the site.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.089
Now, gentlesurgeon1
is his handle.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.525
All we need now
is his real name.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.829
Mundo:
<i>Dr. Palermo.</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:52.330
You were recently
arrested for assaulting

13:52.332 --> 13:54.499
A woman in a restaurant.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.934
You put your hands
on a young girl

13:55.936 --> 13:57.335
And roughed her up in public.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.403
You don't understand!

13:58.405 --> 14:00.071
That girl took my money!

14:00.073 --> 14:01.172
Don't get loud.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.874
Explain.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.909
You listen, I'll watch.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.578
Yes, I'm a member
of truelovewaiting.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.479
But...

14:08.481 --> 14:10.548
I was looking
for something more.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.417
So I joined

14:12.419 --> 14:14.419
One of those
sugar-daddy-type sites.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.920
Casualsugar.Com.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.622
You pay a girl
a lump sum every month

14:17.624 --> 14:19.023
For future dates.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.291
Bad move.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.361
I gave her money,
and she blew our date off.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.463
Changed her chat handle.
I complained to the admin,

14:25.465 --> 14:27.065
But they didn't help.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.033
So I scoured the site.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.302
Found her new profile

14:31.304 --> 14:32.470
Name and picture.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.205
Kept up on her next date.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.440
And confronted her in person.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.574
He's telling the truth.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.376
So, you're on a lot
of these sites?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.944
These dating sites,
sugar sites?

14:39.946 --> 14:42.080
All kinds.
I play the field.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.348
I'm a single man.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.415
A neurosurgeon.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.384
I work 18-hour days,
six days a week.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.486
When's the last time you
heard from missy bowers?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.521
A few days ago.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.390
Was she on casualsugar.Com?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.424
Missy?
(laughs)

14:53.426 --> 14:55.126
No, never.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.661
She's looking
for a serious commitment.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.596
I'm not ready, so...

14:58.598 --> 15:00.999
We're pretty much
on her timetable.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.433
Did you know she was missing?

15:02.435 --> 15:03.534
Missing?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.003
How long?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.905
Around 36 hours.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.675
And because I put my hands
on that other girl,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.911
You think I...
Yeah.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.545
Well.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.548
This is my I.D. To get
in and out of the hospital.

15:17.550 --> 15:21.152
I've been on the clock
for three straight days.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.620
Yeah.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.657
You can check me out
as much as you want.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.296
Sifter:
Welcome back.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.431
Avery, can I have a word
with you in private?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.632
From the look on your face,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.100
It looks like it's
more than just a word.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.702
I'll go back to their
friendagenda pages.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.704
Drill down from there.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.339
Trish mccarthy.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.207
What about her?

15:43.209 --> 15:44.609
Well, she got arrested.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.211
She's down at county jail,
screaming your name out

15:47.213 --> 15:48.513
At the jailer.
Now, why does that name

15:48.515 --> 15:51.182
Mccarthy sound familiar to me?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.650
Trish mccarthy is
the surviving sister

15:52.652 --> 15:54.218
Of danielle mccarthy.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.520
Right.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.255
Your client who was murdered

15:57.257 --> 15:59.090
When your files were stolen.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.225
Look, in light of past events

16:01.227 --> 16:04.696
With your former client
and her sister,

16:04.698 --> 16:06.230
I'm gonna be honest with you.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.332
I think you need
to get out of here.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.634
Go calm her down.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.235
Trish mccarthy has
committed a crime.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.172
In fact, make
that several crimes

16:14.174 --> 16:15.206
At her sister's gravesite.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.342
Crimes?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.410
Uh, what did she do?

16:20.379 --> 16:22.447
(buzzer blares)

16:29.722 --> 16:32.223
Trish? It's me.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.292
It's avery.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.141
Trish?

16:50.143 --> 16:53.277
I heard about what happened.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.545
Are you okay?

16:54.547 --> 16:57.515
No. I-I'm not okay.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.051
They stopped me
before I could get her out.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.720
Danielle doesn't
like it down there.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.155
It's cold and it's dark.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.323
And-and she can't take it.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.624
Sh-she-she needs to be with me

17:06.626 --> 17:08.159
So I can take care of her!

17:08.161 --> 17:12.030
You're suffering from a
brief psychotic episode

17:12.032 --> 17:15.600
It's been known to happen
years after a traumatic

17:15.602 --> 17:17.201
Event like danielle's death.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.772
Look, I-I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.040
I was on a case.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.474
But you're always on a case.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.510
You're too busy

17:25.512 --> 17:26.778
For your own damn good.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.413
We used to hang, we used to...

17:28.415 --> 17:31.349
Have lunch.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.485
And you never call me anymore.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.753
I left you messages.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.789
You never call back.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.692
Oh, don't do that... Reverse
psychology bull with me!

17:41.694 --> 17:43.594
You're-you're only here because,
because I got arrested.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.596
Yeah, trish, they
want to prosecute you

17:45.598 --> 17:47.098
For trespassing
and for grave robbing.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.667
I never robbed anything!

17:49.669 --> 17:52.670
I'm the one that
was robbed when-when

17:52.672 --> 17:56.307
That animal...
Murdered my sister!

17:56.309 --> 17:57.809
(shushes)

17:57.811 --> 18:00.678
Okay, look at you.
Your hands!

18:00.680 --> 18:03.614
You're bleeding,
you got blisters.
Oh, you don't care.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.650
You're too busy

18:05.652 --> 18:08.152
Chasing ghosts

18:08.154 --> 18:10.488
Instead of regarding
the one that haunts you.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.360
It's your fault.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.129
Oh, it's your fault...

18:18.131 --> 18:20.264
That she's dead.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.732
She'd be here now

18:21.734 --> 18:24.435
If it wasn't for you,
and you know it.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.304
It's your fault
and you know it.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.472
No, it's not my fault.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.540
My computer got
broken into.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.310
All my patients'
electronic files got stolen.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.878
This was early
internet-- before

18:33.880 --> 18:35.446
Firewalls and encryption...

18:35.448 --> 18:38.683
My sister is dead.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.854
You should've just

18:42.856 --> 18:45.823
Buried me with her
and thrown me in that hole

18:45.825 --> 18:47.892
And buried me with her.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.601
I'm gonna call the hospital...

19:01.173 --> 19:02.573
...And we're gonna
get you checked out.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.743
I'm here now.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.183
(knocking)

19:12.185 --> 19:13.651
(buzzing)

19:15.320 --> 19:18.389
(door closes)
avery?

19:24.630 --> 19:26.464
All right, let-let's
talk this through again, guys,

19:26.466 --> 19:30.868
We have two women: Missy bowers
and elizabeth marks. Both

19:30.870 --> 19:32.737
Have almost the same physical
description, right?

19:32.739 --> 19:35.640
Right-a-mundo.
Now, missy bowers
was on truelovewaiting,

19:35.642 --> 19:37.375
Elizabeth was not.
Yup, yup.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.743
So from a cyber perspective,
the only thing

19:38.745 --> 19:41.345
These two women have
in common is friendagenda.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.747
But the whole world's
on friendagenda.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.216
Yeah, but our target--
whether it was a man or woman

19:45.218 --> 19:46.751
Or a male-female team--
was able to track

19:46.753 --> 19:49.220
Both elizabeth and missy, so

19:49.222 --> 19:50.788
What is it about their
friendagenda accounts

19:50.790 --> 19:52.356
That's out of the ordinary?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.625
Well, they take
a lot of selfies.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.227
I mean, look at the upper folds.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.862
Both missy and elizabeth
have folders with over

19:57.864 --> 19:58.963
A thousand
pictures in 'em.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.365
Baby face, analyze a photo

20:01.367 --> 20:03.734
From each account and see
what the metadata tells you.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.473
Mundo:
That's it.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.908
Both missy and elizabeth
never turned

20:10.910 --> 20:12.543
Their location services
function off.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.911
Every time
they took a selfie, they

20:13.913 --> 20:15.279
Broadcast everything
about themselves

20:15.281 --> 20:16.514
And they didn't even know it.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.350
<i>One selfie can produce</i>
<i>the time and date</i>

20:19.352 --> 20:20.918
<i>Of when a photo was taken,</i>

20:20.920 --> 20:22.753
<i>The make and model</i>
<i>of the device used,</i>

20:22.755 --> 20:25.223
<i>And most importantly--</i>
<i>and most dangerously--</i>

20:25.225 --> 20:27.792
<i>The latitude and longitude</i>
<i>of where the photo was taken,</i>

20:27.794 --> 20:30.261
Which would allow a target to
track them right back to their

20:30.263 --> 20:33.531
All right, so we know
how he tracked 'em,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.566
Now we have to figure out
how he grabbed 'em.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.867
All right, let's profile him.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.603
You're the target,
you're looking at this metadata,

20:38.605 --> 20:39.937
What do you see?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.505
Well, the more selfies
these girls took,

20:41.507 --> 20:43.307
The more they gave
our target a road map

20:43.309 --> 20:46.244
Into their daily life. All
the target would need to do is

20:46.246 --> 20:47.745
Track their behavior
and figure out

20:47.747 --> 20:49.780
When they were the most
vulnerable to abduct.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.716
I mean, look at missy bowers'
cluster of selfies--

20:51.718 --> 20:55.386
She took a ton at the
karaoke bar near the university.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.687
And mostly around
10:30 p.M.,

20:56.689 --> 21:00.925
Right, most campus crime
against women happens at night.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.893
So she very easily could have
been abducted in the dark

21:02.895 --> 21:05.296
Somewhere between leaving class
and going to karaoke.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.964
University cameras catch
anything on film?

21:06.966 --> 21:09.700
I read the campus
police report-- nada.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.636
All right, well, metadata
from missy's selfies tells us

21:11.638 --> 21:13.537
That the karaoke bar is
directly across the street

21:13.539 --> 21:14.538
From student parking.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.806
Street cams.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.275
Pull them up, see if they caught

21:17.277 --> 21:18.376
Anything the university
cameras missed.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.749
There.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.384
Freeze.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.019
Enhance the image.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.821
Run that bastard through
facial recognition software.

21:33.525 --> 21:35.893
Nelson: Wow,
that was fast.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.695
Barry tipton.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.530
Manhattan, new york.

21:50.676 --> 21:51.676
Fbi!

21:51.678 --> 21:53.010
Nobody move!

21:58.016 --> 21:59.950
Who's barry tipton?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.836
Man: An average new yorker
gets caught on camera

22:18.838 --> 22:21.372
Over a thousand times a day
just walking the streets.

22:24.443 --> 22:25.810
And don't think
for one minute

22:25.812 --> 22:27.945
Big brother isn't harvesting
that information.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.914
With the "no persona" mask,

22:29.916 --> 22:32.650
Big bro tracks my face,

22:32.652 --> 22:34.051
Not our citizens.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.653
It's pretty
genius, right?

22:35.655 --> 22:38.889
How many of these masks
have you sold to date?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.458
30,000 this year.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.594
We sold out at the black
hat conference in vegas.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.729
Do you have credit card
transactions

22:44.731 --> 22:45.996
For the people
who purchased these masks?

22:45.998 --> 22:48.399
Credit cards?
Are you kidding?

22:48.401 --> 22:50.134
Give away all that precious
electronic information?

22:50.136 --> 22:53.471
No persona's a
cash-only business.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.040
My clients pride
themselves on anonymity.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.545
Catch you later.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.688
Both:
Five foot-two!

23:10.690 --> 23:11.689
Oh, yeah!
(grunts)
yeah!

23:11.691 --> 23:12.690
That's what
I'm talking about.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.425
Baby face and big boy
heating up.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.693
Uh-huh.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.428
Abductor was a female.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.029
Push in on the
small on her back.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.467
Nelson:
Look at that.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.569
"seven, six, five, four,

23:25.571 --> 23:27.104
Three, two, one."

23:27.106 --> 23:28.105
Boo-yah.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.674
Four, three and two
are all crossed out.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.109
But the one is not.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.177
Well, if that's
the case, we found

23:33.179 --> 23:34.445
The target's
number one girl.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.980
The queen bee.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.481
Miss seniority.
Yeah.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.483
That's what I'm talking
about, baby.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.484
Three times.
(grunts)

23:40.486 --> 23:41.485
(grunts)
yeah.

23:41.487 --> 23:42.887
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

23:42.889 --> 23:43.754
(humming)

23:43.756 --> 23:45.589
That's how
you feel it?

23:45.591 --> 23:46.724
You got to
bring it back.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.725
Throw in a robot.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.427
Break it down.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.462
No!
(sighs)

23:51.464 --> 23:52.997
Anti big brother mask.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.732
It was a dead end.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.134
You may have a dead end, but
we just got a new beginning.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.836
Yeah, baby face
and I might have just found

23:58.838 --> 23:59.837
Our target's right-hand woman.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.139
All but the one's
crossed out.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.874
It's got to be
a ranking system.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.876
All right, which means that when
elizabeth marks ended up dead,

24:05.878 --> 24:09.647
Uh-huh.
So everybody in his perverted
harem moved up.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.516
And missy bowers became
the new number seven.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.785
(crying):
I swear. I swear.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.787
Please don't kill me.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.789
I have a mom.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.058
She must be worried sick
where I am...

24:21.060 --> 24:22.526
(screams)

24:22.528 --> 24:24.595
Man:
Brand her.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.896
She's mine now.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.700
(screams, cries)

24:42.647 --> 24:44.715
(screams)

25:04.603 --> 25:06.637
(tapping on glass)

25:08.073 --> 25:09.807
Come in.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.776
Is now a good time or...?

25:12.778 --> 25:14.845
Yeah, come in.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.820
Look, I don't know
exactly what's going on,

25:22.822 --> 25:24.889
But just know that
we're all thinking about you.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.191
Oh.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.660
Uh...

25:29.662 --> 25:31.662
Um...

25:31.664 --> 25:34.265
Maybe you should hug me after I
give you the case-cracking news.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.108
I'm not really
good at this.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.913
But, uh, I'm gonna step
out of my comfort zone.

25:52.584 --> 25:55.119
I don't think I've
ever told you

25:55.121 --> 25:57.221
How I appreciate you.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.689
Oh...

25:58.691 --> 26:00.691
No, you work
seven days a week,

26:00.693 --> 26:02.326
18 hours a day.

26:02.328 --> 26:06.130
And I know you do it
because you love your job.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.799
But you also do it
because you love me.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.169
And I think
sometimes I just

26:12.171 --> 26:14.171
Spend so much time
chasing ghosts,

26:14.173 --> 26:17.241
I don't really regard the people
that are right in front of me.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.585
That...
(chuckles)

26:27.587 --> 26:31.589
That, uh, might single-handedly
be the most amazing thing

26:31.591 --> 26:33.657
Any human being
has ever said to me.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.762
I'm, uh...

26:38.764 --> 26:40.764
I'm gonna step back into
my comfort zone now.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.299
Okay.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.634
So what do you
got for me?

26:43.636 --> 26:46.170
Yeah, uh, well...

26:46.172 --> 26:47.671
Uh, we went back
to the stone age

26:47.673 --> 26:49.039
On all the abducted women
in new york

26:49.041 --> 26:50.040
With that same
description--

26:50.042 --> 26:51.642
Five foot-two,
eyes of blue,

26:51.644 --> 26:54.044
Fake updates,
yada yada yada.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.748
Um, it turns out that we have
the names of all seven girls.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.917
Krumitz: <i>Okay, number one</i>
<i>in our rankings--</i>

26:59.919 --> 27:02.786
Vanessa gillerman,
missing since 2004.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.122
Based on the tattoos,
we believe it was vanessa

27:05.124 --> 27:07.057
Who kidnapped missy
bowers at the university

27:07.059 --> 27:08.325
On behalf of
the target.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.327
Well, it's too risky
for our target to surface

27:10.329 --> 27:12.796
To replace elizabeth marks
with another woman.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.798
So he sent
his most senior girl.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.333
That makes sense.
Number two--

27:16.335 --> 27:18.335
Natalie walker,
missing since 2009.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.639
Number three-- barbara smith,
missing since 2010.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.641
Number four-- gina zito.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.643
Number five--
elizabeth marks,

27:25.645 --> 27:27.645
Recently deceased.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.179
Number six--
tiffany best.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.415
And number seven,
our most recent-- missy bowers.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.217
Get everything you can
on vanessa gillerman.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.386
She's been
with our target the longest.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.154
Maybe you could find someone
in her life

27:37.156 --> 27:39.056
Who can give me some insight
into her.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.125
(siren tooting)

27:45.030 --> 27:47.364
(crying):
I hated her

27:47.366 --> 27:50.367
For leaving me
with that pedophile,

27:50.369 --> 27:53.003
But now I get it.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.407
This diary is heartbreaking.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.208
Your father

27:58.210 --> 28:02.112
Started abusing you and vanessa
when you were four years old?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.447
(sniffles)

28:03.449 --> 28:06.717
Truth is, I've locked that part
of my life away

28:06.719 --> 28:08.352
And thrown away the key.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.255
I have a suspicion
vanessa has, too.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.756
Look, juliet,
I know

28:12.758 --> 28:14.892
The last thing
that you want to do

28:14.894 --> 28:16.994
Is dig up the most painful part
of your past,

28:16.996 --> 28:18.762
But if you
want to see

28:18.764 --> 28:20.798
Your sister again, I need you

28:20.800 --> 28:23.167
To remind her
of what you two lived through.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.137
Why?

28:27.139 --> 28:29.139
I have a plan.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.776
An amplified plan.

28:32.778 --> 28:36.180
<i>By sending vanessa</i>
<i>a direct message,</i>

28:36.182 --> 28:38.182
<i>Posting on</i>
<i>her friendagenda wall,</i>

28:38.184 --> 28:40.184
<i>And inviting her</i>
<i>to a public chat room</i>

28:40.186 --> 28:42.386
<i>Amplifies the horror</i>
<i>she once lived.</i>

28:42.388 --> 28:46.290
<i>My goal is to push her buttons</i>
<i>so she surfaces.</i>

28:48.193 --> 28:50.094
(beep)

28:51.963 --> 28:54.898
Juliet:
<i>Dear vanessa, it's juliet.</i>

28:54.900 --> 28:56.200
<i>Long time.</i>

28:56.202 --> 28:59.937
<i>I'm not sure you heard.</i>

28:59.939 --> 29:01.305
<i>Dad died.</i>

29:01.307 --> 29:03.006
<i>He told me on his deathbed</i>

29:03.008 --> 29:05.209
<i>How sorry he was</i>

29:05.211 --> 29:07.144
<i>For physically</i>

29:07.146 --> 29:10.514
<i>And sexually abusing you</i>

29:10.516 --> 29:13.250
And me.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.085
(voice breaking):
Those nights...

29:15.087 --> 29:17.488
In the basement...

29:17.490 --> 29:19.423
(cries)

29:21.092 --> 29:24.027
<i>I can still hear your screams.</i>

29:24.029 --> 29:25.429
<i>The way</i>

29:25.431 --> 29:28.866
<i>You called out for our mother.</i>

29:28.868 --> 29:30.968
You were just a child.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.369
(computer beeps)

29:32.371 --> 29:35.439
<i>We were his victims,</i>
<i>not his daughters.</i>

29:35.441 --> 29:37.474
<i>We need to go public</i>
<i>with our pain</i>

29:37.476 --> 29:40.077
<i>So no other women suffer...</i>

29:42.413 --> 29:44.481
(crickets chirping)

29:49.320 --> 29:51.822
(brakes squeak)

30:06.538 --> 30:08.939
Fbi! Stop!

30:08.941 --> 30:12.176
Above your head-- both
hands above your head

30:12.178 --> 30:14.912
Right now.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.847
(groaning)

30:18.249 --> 30:20.417
You're wanted
for questioning

30:20.419 --> 30:22.252
In the abduction
of missy bowers.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.454
(grunting)

30:30.395 --> 30:34.431
(yelling)

30:34.433 --> 30:36.500
You were under the power
of a madman,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.902
A sadistic psychopath.

30:38.904 --> 30:42.406
You have no right to talk
about my master like that!

30:42.408 --> 30:45.142
Who the hell do you think
you are to bestow judgment

30:45.144 --> 30:47.144
On me, you stupid pig cop?!

30:47.146 --> 30:48.879
You know nothing!

30:50.014 --> 30:52.983
Send that other bitch in here.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.852
I'm done with you.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.588
(shouting):
I know you're right there!

31:00.258 --> 31:02.326
Oh, my god.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.495
It's like she's possessed.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.398
How can she defend
the sicko who took her?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.534
Stockholm syndrome.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.903
The longer women are
kept by their abductors,

31:12.905 --> 31:16.106
The more they're
brainwashed to defend him...

31:16.108 --> 31:17.374
To the death.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.642
(door opens)

31:21.212 --> 31:23.280
(door squeaks shut)

31:29.988 --> 31:32.055
Do you know
who this is?

31:44.002 --> 31:46.069
Your father.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.906
And this?

31:50.275 --> 31:53.043
That's the whore!

31:53.045 --> 31:55.345
Who's trying to ruin me online.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.180
I made her do it.
(panting)

31:57.182 --> 31:59.516
And it worked;
you're here.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.087
And who's this?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.222
Hmm?

32:07.058 --> 32:09.092
Hmm?

32:09.094 --> 32:10.560
Look at you.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.664
When you were a little girl.

32:21.039 --> 32:24.241
I know what your father
did to you.

32:25.243 --> 32:28.445
I understand you think
you love your master.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.281
That you think
he keeps you safe.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.588
He doesn't keep
me in chains.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.992
You don't have to be shackled
in chains to be restrained.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.062
You have a sister

32:45.064 --> 32:47.264
Who loves you
very much.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.333
You are all
she has left

32:49.335 --> 32:50.500
In the world.

32:50.502 --> 32:54.338
Do you want to take
your power back?

32:54.340 --> 32:57.341
Do you want
to be powerful?

32:57.343 --> 33:00.277
Because you
have the power

33:00.279 --> 33:03.380
To break the chains

33:03.382 --> 33:06.216
And set these innocent women

33:06.218 --> 33:07.684
Free.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.619
And let them
go home.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.692
Rot in hell.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.731
(laughs)

33:23.768 --> 33:25.335
(laughing loudly)

33:28.006 --> 33:30.507
I'll tell you
one thing, though.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.045
He will never be able
to replace me.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.384
I was his everything.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.520
There will never be
another number one.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.659
You just told me
how to catch him.

33:54.399 --> 33:56.233
(door closes)

33:56.235 --> 33:59.169
(screaming)

34:00.338 --> 34:03.273
These are the top dating sites
on the web as we speak.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.509
Our target is a hypersexualized
control freak

34:05.511 --> 34:07.444
Who just lost
his number one girl.

34:07.446 --> 34:11.415
Will to be compulsively
replenish the number seven.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.349
Seven is a "creation" number.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.551
Our target has a god complex.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.186
He will replace vanessa

34:16.188 --> 34:17.687
With a mechanism
that he is comfortable with.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.222
The dating site.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.791
The screen prompts
are his signature.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.459
Ryan:
The second our target

34:22.461 --> 34:24.828
Inputs his type online,
we got him.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.704
Rumysoulmate
just got a hit.

34:34.706 --> 34:38.308
Krumitz?
Running the name past the I.S.P.
Now, give me one second.

34:41.345 --> 34:42.712
Jasper cross. 333

34:42.714 --> 34:45.515
Mulberry place.
Albany, new york.

34:50.321 --> 34:53.223
Fbi!
Fbi!

35:04.302 --> 35:06.703
All right, we're clear.

35:30.661 --> 35:32.762
(gasps)
fbi.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.364
Where's jasper cross?

35:42.406 --> 35:43.874
(whispers):
Where is he?

35:48.513 --> 35:50.647
Cross:
Drop your weapons
or I'll kill 'em all.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.184
Mr. Cross,
I'm afraid

35:54.186 --> 35:56.753
Dropping our weapons
is not an option.

35:57.623 --> 36:02.592
Toss me your weapons or I will
murder every last one of 'em.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.728
Now!

36:04.730 --> 36:06.363
This is agent mundo.
Pull back.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.865
Say again: Pull back.
Our suspect is armed.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.400
You're not gonna
make it out of here alive.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.568
You know that, don't you?

36:11.570 --> 36:12.736
You take me out,

36:12.738 --> 36:14.838
They're coming
along with.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.374
Ain't that
right, girls?

36:17.376 --> 36:19.376
Avery, stand down.
He's got an ak-47.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.778
That's 600 rounds a
minute at close range.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.513
He is in control.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.648
Cross:
You should listen
to your friend.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.284
He's the only reason
you and my girls

36:27.286 --> 36:30.687
Are still alive.
Ryan: Your girls?

36:30.689 --> 36:33.590
You know something?

36:33.592 --> 36:35.659
I know a lot more
than you think.

36:35.661 --> 36:38.295
You know how?

36:38.297 --> 36:39.796
Vanessa.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.798
Vanessa told me

36:41.800 --> 36:44.267
About you and your girls.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.570
She told me that
you're a coward.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.338
That you're
a coward

36:48.340 --> 36:50.640
Who made her do
your dirty work.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.976
Do you know what kind of man

36:52.978 --> 36:55.779
That can only have
relationships with women

36:55.781 --> 36:57.581
Who are
captives?

36:57.583 --> 37:00.850
The kind of man who can't
get women on his own merits.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.586
The kind of man

37:02.588 --> 37:05.655
Who's afraid of women.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.229
Are you afraid of me, jasper?

37:12.231 --> 37:15.265
Are you?

37:16.867 --> 37:19.002
Because you should be.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.772
You should be
very afraid of me.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.774
(gunshots)
(women shriek)

37:24.776 --> 37:27.510
Agent:
Seal the perimeter.
Let's go.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.412
Missy?
It's okay.

37:29.414 --> 37:32.015
I'm special agent avery ryan.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.517
It's okay, girls, we're
gonna get you all home.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.429
Here you go.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.534
Are you okay?

37:51.536 --> 37:53.703
Yeah. Thank you.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.674
You're very brave,
you know that?

37:57.676 --> 38:00.677
I prayed a lot.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.779
I asked for my
mother's strength.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.948
Mm.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.654
What happened to elizabeth?

38:10.656 --> 38:13.390
From what the other
girls told me,

38:13.392 --> 38:15.458
Vanessa killed her.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.396
Elizabeth was
number five.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.065
After about a year and
a half, that jasper guy

38:22.067 --> 38:24.467
Gave her special
privileges.

38:24.469 --> 38:28.038
She was able to not
live in her shackles,

38:28.040 --> 38:29.706
Go out into
the real world.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.077
Jasper only eats
gluten-free bread.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.880
It's in the organic aisle.
Light blue label.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.352
Go get one loaf
and meet me in produce.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.421
Yes, madam.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.793
Ma'am, my name is
elizabeth marks.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.495
My son is having a
seizure. Can I just

38:52.497 --> 38:53.830
Use your phone, please?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.098
Please.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.078
So that's how
she ended up in the woods.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.082
(phone beeps)

39:12.084 --> 39:14.084
Well, good news.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.052
Your mom's here.

39:37.641 --> 39:40.377
â™ª

40:05.169 --> 40:08.037
Thank you. You can
leave the shovel. Thank you.

40:14.645 --> 40:17.046
Thanks for
everything.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.915
People at the
hospital were

40:18.917 --> 40:21.584
Real nice-- leveled me out.

40:26.490 --> 40:30.026
Sometimes it's
hard, you know?

40:30.028 --> 40:32.128
Living without her.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.131
Sometimes to move forward,

40:35.133 --> 40:37.534
We have to let go.

40:37.536 --> 40:40.703
That's why I asked you
to meet me here.

40:40.705 --> 40:43.807
So that we could
let go together.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.876
I bought this for the baby.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.946
A little silver cross.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.948
But I never had a chance

40:51.950 --> 40:54.017
To give it to her.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.490
Heart necklace.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.560
Our mother gave it to
us when we were kids,

41:03.562 --> 41:05.628
And we buried her

41:05.630 --> 41:07.564
Wearing the other half.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.101
Thank you

41:45.103 --> 41:47.537
For everything
you've done.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.073
But most of all, thank
you for loving her.
