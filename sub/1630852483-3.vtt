18:53.360 --> 18:55.500
not medicinal herbs used in the palace?

18:55.600 --> 18:58.170
It is. It is known as the best tonic.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.370
However, it can become
the best poison if abused.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.410
The best poison? What do you mean?

19:08.710 --> 19:12.580
Many know aconite as a medicinal herb,

19:13.180 --> 19:15.520
but it can be poisonous

19:16.280 --> 19:17.820
depending on how you use it.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.060
[I have an abscess on my back.]

19:33.530 --> 19:35.100
[What medicinal herbs were used?]

19:38.410 --> 19:40.110
[Aconite, my lord.]

19:44.140 --> 19:46.910
Commoners are prohibited
from cultivating that medicinal herb.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.950
But to use that means

19:49.050 --> 19:51.120
the mastermind is no ordinary person.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.590
Please be careful.

20:05.230 --> 20:08.840
My lord, let us hurry up
and head to the next must-eat place.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.670
What is going to be our next meal?

20:13.270 --> 20:14.410
I cannot believe it was aconite.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.810
Aconite?

20:18.010 --> 20:19.380
Is there such food?

20:19.710 --> 20:21.380
Is it good?

20:23.620 --> 20:24.620
What?

20:25.950 --> 20:28.660
It was a divine move for me to come here.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.560
We must hurry.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.660
Before rumors go around
that a secret royal inspector

20:33.730 --> 20:35.260
is stirring around Chungcheong Province,

20:35.330 --> 20:37.300
I will follow the route
of the tax shipping freighter.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.430
I will find

20:40.230 --> 20:42.740
the mastermind behind this case.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.240
But...

20:51.880 --> 20:55.180
Goo-pal, seems like visiting
must-eat places will have to be postponed.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.620
Darn it.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.190
Seriously?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.160
They say furniture has memories, too.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.510
You should all forget about me.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.020
What do you think you are taking?

21:34.290 --> 21:36.920
You should be kicked out stark naked,

21:36.990 --> 21:39.660
but to think you can take your share.
In your dreams!

21:39.730 --> 21:42.760
Your liquor jugs.
I smashed them all yesterday.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.300
-What?
-Because I hate you.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.640
It is my revenge before leaving the house.

21:49.740 --> 21:54.240
You are openly throwing a fit now,
are you not?

21:54.310 --> 21:58.210
How dare you smash
all those priceless liquor, you wench?

22:02.780 --> 22:04.380
Even if you get sick,

22:04.480 --> 22:06.720
there is no money for medicine because
of the gambling debt your son is in.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.120
So do not use this to buy liquor.

22:11.590 --> 22:14.260
Save this money
and use it for medicine someday.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.170
How dare you try
to teach your mother-in-law!

22:21.470 --> 22:23.000
You are rotten until the very end!

22:23.070 --> 22:25.040
You never know when the police
will come to crackdown liquor.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.470
Do not make any at home.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.940
Why do you care?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.810
You said we were strangers now!

22:33.680 --> 22:37.020
You said we were strangers now.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.990
You wench!

22:44.420 --> 22:46.990
Go back home.
You have never once seen me off.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.730
You really should not do this!

22:52.100 --> 22:54.030
I will forgive you for everything!

22:54.100 --> 22:57.200
Out of the majigi barley field I have,

22:57.270 --> 22:59.370
I will give you a summajigi.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.650
Just stay!

23:06.710 --> 23:09.050
Did you sell your new soul to the road?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.390
Can she not hear me?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.260
Where do you think you are going?

23:19.460 --> 23:21.530
This is a handsome sum of money.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.830
How did she save all of this?

23:25.530 --> 23:28.440
What? He already left?

23:28.500 --> 23:30.470
Since the case became a mess,

23:30.540 --> 23:32.310
there must be a lot to report to Hanyang.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.210
So he left in a hurry.

23:35.380 --> 23:39.780
By any chance, did he mention
where he will go?

23:41.110 --> 23:42.580
Stop being ridiculous.

23:43.780 --> 23:46.050
Secret royal inspectors,
like their title, move in secret.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.090
He would never disclose his destination.

23:49.590 --> 23:50.990
I see.

23:54.630 --> 23:58.170
Maybe I should have received
whatever reward he was willing to give me.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.570
All that aside, Inspector Ra wanted me

24:01.840 --> 24:03.070
to hand this to you.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.910
What is this?

24:11.880 --> 24:14.350
[Mount Gyehwa]

24:12.350 --> 24:14.350
I was told to tell you to go there.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.030
Little lady, not so fast.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.260
Did you think we would just let you pass?

24:29.360 --> 24:31.060
Divorce is no joke.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.970
When a man and a woman marry--

24:33.030 --> 24:34.570
That hurts!

24:39.070 --> 24:40.210
-Wait!
-Why you...

24:47.180 --> 24:48.350
Unbelievable.

24:50.650 --> 24:53.490
A woman so brute and feisty

24:53.690 --> 24:55.290
only has a rough life ahead of her.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.990
-Darn.
-Like mother, like daughter.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.960
Your mother was dragged off to Qing
but lived on without ending her life.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.530
You both are a disgrace to our town!

25:53.480 --> 25:54.750
My friend.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.020
Your life was worthwhile.

25:59.550 --> 26:00.650
It was.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.120
There she comes.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.090
Gosh.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.590
Goodness.

27:13.390 --> 27:14.530
Are you leaving now?

27:17.060 --> 27:18.230
Sweetheart.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.770
What is this?

27:26.570 --> 27:28.710
They are Chinese trumpet vine seeds.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.340
These precious flowers are only planted

27:31.410 --> 27:33.250
in the house of the nobles.

27:34.310 --> 27:37.850
Do you perhaps know
what these flowers signify?

27:40.020 --> 27:41.290
Honor.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.860
Not even the deity

27:45.060 --> 27:48.230
could stop these flowers from blooming.

27:49.330 --> 27:51.400
Never bend for anyone

27:51.630 --> 27:53.600
and be your own woman.

27:53.770 --> 27:55.100
I will be rooting for you.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.910
Be well.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.810
-Thank you.
-Sure.

28:16.190 --> 28:17.360
Jo-yi!

28:18.660 --> 28:20.390
You did well hanging in there.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.800
Take care!

28:22.900 --> 28:24.700
You made the right choice.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.430
Do not come back here

28:27.870 --> 28:31.570
and live your life freely
like a butterfly!

29:14.910 --> 29:16.080
Goodness, my lord.

29:16.620 --> 29:17.820
My dear.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.790
-This way, please.
-Of course.

29:21.350 --> 29:23.420
Mal-jong, I heard
you were hosting a feast.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.690
As if that is any news.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.190
Every meal of every day
is like a feast to him.

29:28.260 --> 29:31.500
What is different is that
I have a reason for one.

29:31.630 --> 29:32.700
A reason?

29:32.830 --> 29:35.670
Tae-seo, the cupellation was a success.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.910
Cupellation? It is the process
that separates pure silver

29:40.310 --> 29:42.180
from silver ores.

29:43.510 --> 29:44.640
Is that true?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.280
Congratulations. I truly mean it.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.750
How could the King ignore
such a valuable process?

29:50.950 --> 29:53.450
Tae-seo is definitely
more of a leader than he is.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
-Of course, he is.
-Yes!

29:56.060 --> 29:58.990
Soon enough, Joseon will be in your hands.

29:59.730 --> 30:01.190
Pathetic, is he not?

30:02.530 --> 30:03.830
The King, I mean.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.330
He is oblivious to the ways of the world.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.640
All he does is sit around
at Changdeok Palace

30:10.240 --> 30:12.740
trying to secure his place on the throne.

30:18.340 --> 30:20.610
Father, what brings you by?

30:26.390 --> 30:27.820
Nobody moves!

30:32.760 --> 30:34.390
The bigger the audience,

30:34.890 --> 30:37.400
the greater the humiliation.

30:41.330 --> 30:42.540
-Father--
-Shut it!

30:43.570 --> 30:46.470
If there are any fools who believe

30:46.570 --> 30:49.440
that being chummy with him
will get them anywhere,

30:50.240 --> 30:52.480
I advise them to remember
what they say today.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.250
But...

31:01.990 --> 31:03.060
Father.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.230
Father.

31:08.630 --> 31:09.660
Father.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.460
I am the fool

31:12.130 --> 31:15.340
for giving you a task
thinking that you were of use.

31:16.540 --> 31:19.470
Father, I do not understand.

31:21.740 --> 31:25.580
When one is ordered to steal,
he should do so silently.

31:25.980 --> 31:28.780
Because you were stupid enough
to make a mess of things,

31:29.150 --> 31:31.150
rumors have been spreading about

31:31.220 --> 31:33.120
a storage in a southern region
being raided.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.420
So would it not be better

31:37.190 --> 31:39.690
for me to be the one who buries you?

31:44.630 --> 31:46.630
Father, I...

31:48.170 --> 31:49.540
It was for you.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.870
Everything I did

31:53.870 --> 31:57.140
-was to please you.
-And I told you to be discreet!

32:03.250 --> 32:05.290
A secret royal inspector was murdered,

32:05.950 --> 32:07.950
and the ledger is nowhere to be seen.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.660
The secret royal inspector appointed from
the Office of Special Counselors

32:11.760 --> 32:13.790
will now hunt you down.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.400
So here is an idea.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.500
How about you
take the blame for everything

32:22.840 --> 32:26.210
and let the secret royal inspector
wipe you off the face of this earth?

32:33.150 --> 32:34.310
Tae-seo.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.740
Do not

33:04.480 --> 33:06.550
disappoint me.

33:14.350 --> 33:15.560
My son.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.740
I hear you,

33:31.570 --> 33:32.670
Father.

33:39.610 --> 33:40.710
Get up!

33:42.980 --> 33:45.520
Kill the secret royal inspector
who was recently sent here.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.520
And how would we know who he is?

33:49.990 --> 33:51.390
Whether it is the secret royal inspector

33:52.590 --> 33:54.160
or someone who could be him,

33:55.930 --> 33:57.700
just kill them all.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.600
The moment I hear
he is back in Hanyang to give his report,

34:07.310 --> 34:09.380
you will be as good as dead.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.420
Giddyap!

34:27.290 --> 34:29.900
These rice cakes are very precious.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.699
Why are you burning them?

34:31.760 --> 34:34.400
My point exactly.
We should be sucking on them right now.

34:34.469 --> 34:37.270
Be quiet. When you cook them like this,
they taste even better.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.040
Crispy on the outside
and chewy on the inside.

34:41.310 --> 34:43.679
Good. They are cooked to perfection.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.780
Take out the soft persimmon
we got from Gyehwa Valley.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.280
The soft persimmon?

34:57.960 --> 34:58.990
Wait.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.030
Give me that.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.040
Why would you mash
the persimmon like that?

35:12.270 --> 35:13.270
My gosh.

35:17.510 --> 35:18.540
Give me that.

35:32.990 --> 35:34.030
Here.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.610
What did I tell you? I am a true gourmet.

35:54.910 --> 35:56.080
I told you it would be delicious.

35:57.050 --> 35:58.320
Soft persimmons are easy to digest.

35:58.380 --> 35:59.750
-It is also...
-There he goes again,

35:59.820 --> 36:02.260
lecturing us on food.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.490
Because he works
in the Office of Special Counselors,

36:04.790 --> 36:07.090
every word he uses is awfully pretentious
and obnoxious.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.600
-It is very good for you.
-What a braggart.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.930
-Chew on a pebble, you punks!
-"Chew on..."

36:15.300 --> 36:16.340
Here.

36:21.510 --> 36:25.140
Did the Crown Prince
like soft persimmons too?

36:28.780 --> 36:29.850
What?

36:31.320 --> 36:32.390
Oh, right.

36:37.190 --> 36:39.260
The Crown Prince has been gone

36:39.990 --> 36:41.460
for over a year already.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.600
He is not gone.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.840
I still see him often.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.310
I see him every night, in my sleep.

36:54.810 --> 36:56.310
Who else would I dream of,

36:56.640 --> 36:58.180
but him?

36:59.350 --> 37:00.450
[Your Highness!]

37:04.550 --> 37:06.220
[You were at my side.]

37:16.200 --> 37:19.170
[It was His Royal Highness
who saved my life in the war.]

37:19.230 --> 37:22.670
[I treasure him more
than my real brother.]

37:22.740 --> 37:24.340
[Even when he returned from Qing]

37:24.640 --> 37:26.710
[nine years after he was taken there
as a hostage,]

37:27.910 --> 37:31.140
[he asked to see me before anybody else.]

37:33.680 --> 37:35.280
[-He always]
-Your Royal Highness.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.220
[put me first.]

37:42.960 --> 37:44.260
His Royal Highness

37:45.590 --> 37:46.960
protected me.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.200
Yet I

37:54.300 --> 37:55.670
could not do the same for him.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.320
I need a nap. Wake me up in half an hour.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.750
We must pass the hill today.

38:15.590 --> 38:18.760
Well, have you decided
on the next destination?

38:21.190 --> 38:22.660
We will go to Gongjinchang,

38:23.300 --> 38:25.500
the granary where the grain
on the tax freighter was from.

38:28.330 --> 38:29.700
Gongjinchang?

38:48.350 --> 38:50.460
I am sure the port is this way.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.010
[What do you plan to do
once you get a divorce?]

39:09.240 --> 39:10.440
[I will go to Hanyang.]

39:10.510 --> 39:13.410
[I heard there was a large ship
that sails from the port to Hanyang.]

39:11.410 --> 39:15.310
[Bo-ri's]

39:13.480 --> 39:15.410
[Many noble families live in Hanyang.]

39:15.480 --> 39:18.420
[I can make a living by making clothes
for the noble ladies.]

39:18.480 --> 39:20.820
[As you know,
I am pretty good at making clothes.]

39:21.790 --> 39:24.760
[Why not just forget
about getting a divorce?]

39:24.990 --> 39:26.760
[Stay with your husband
and put up with him.]

39:26.830 --> 39:28.590
[No. I do not want to do that.]

39:28.790 --> 39:30.830
[I do not want to live like this.]

39:31.960 --> 39:35.900
[And most importantly,
I want to find my mother.]

39:51.280 --> 39:52.620
Bo-ri.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.090
Even before I get to start afresh,

39:57.720 --> 39:59.460
I think I got lost.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.030
Giddyap!

40:09.000 --> 40:09.970
Giddyap!

40:20.050 --> 40:22.950
My lord, I really do not think

40:24.320 --> 40:25.580
this is the right way.

40:26.990 --> 40:30.590
Why would anyone take this path
unless they want to die?

40:30.660 --> 40:33.590
If we take the paths
that travelers commonly take,

40:35.330 --> 40:37.030
we will most certainly run into a tiger.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.130
Are we going the right way?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.370
You are certain that
this is the right direction, right?

40:40.630 --> 40:41.670
Do not worry.

40:41.870 --> 40:45.170
Once we go over this hill,
a trail will appear.

40:48.270 --> 40:49.610
This is not the right way.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.150
What?

41:45.060 --> 41:46.900
My gosh, Bo-ri.

41:46.970 --> 41:49.070
There is a shrine here. How fascinating.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.470
The candles are lit.

42:13.490 --> 42:16.430
Yes. Instead of wandering in the dark,

42:16.500 --> 42:17.960
I should just spend the night here.

42:20.930 --> 42:24.200
The deities will keep me safe
if I stay here.

42:25.770 --> 42:28.110
Please forgive me for intruding.

42:40.220 --> 42:43.120
My gosh. Every single one of them
signifies someone's wish.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.960
Everyone is praying with all their heart.

43:37.710 --> 43:41.610
[And live your life freely
like a butterfly!]

43:41.780 --> 43:46.350
[Never bend for anyone
and be your own woman.]

44:10.280 --> 44:13.210
You made it happen on your own,

44:15.310 --> 44:16.450
with your courage.

44:19.050 --> 44:20.120
Why...

44:21.320 --> 44:23.460
Why did I think of Bang-deuk?

44:24.520 --> 44:25.990
I have gone crazy!

44:27.260 --> 44:28.760
It is because I slept sitting down.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.230
Let me lie down.

44:30.300 --> 44:31.430
I should sleep lying down.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.270
I must have really gone crazy.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.070
This is unlike me.

44:54.820 --> 44:55.890
[Found it!]

44:59.830 --> 45:01.860
We did. We finally did.

45:06.630 --> 45:09.000
We were about to die because
of our directionally challenged lord,

45:09.100 --> 45:10.900
but we made it alive!

45:10.970 --> 45:12.540
If the directionally challenged
was not you,

45:12.600 --> 45:14.810
we would have killed him.
But you survived!

45:14.870 --> 45:16.140
I did!

45:17.010 --> 45:19.950
-What?
-You survived. That is what matters.

45:20.510 --> 45:21.680
-Run!
-Okay!

45:21.980 --> 45:23.820
You punks! Stop right there!

45:24.720 --> 45:27.390
-You punks! Stop right there!
-Gosh.

45:27.450 --> 45:28.550
How dare you run away?

45:28.950 --> 45:30.360
I told you to stop!

45:32.190 --> 45:35.060
What is going on? Who are you? What?

45:35.330 --> 45:36.460
Darn it.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.900
Are you not...

45:46.440 --> 45:47.470
Bang-deuk?

45:54.150 --> 45:55.580
Inspector Ra?

46:05.890 --> 46:09.260
So you were sleeping here?

46:09.860 --> 46:10.860
Alone?

46:10.960 --> 46:14.000
It was hard to tell the way,
so I was going to take a short break.

46:14.730 --> 46:17.340
But I must have been
really worn out and fallen asleep.

46:18.570 --> 46:20.610
Anyway, I am sorry.

46:21.370 --> 46:23.080
Are you all right?

46:23.510 --> 46:25.340
No matter how worn out you are,

46:25.410 --> 46:27.550
you should not fall asleep
inside the mountain.

46:27.780 --> 46:30.920
You would have suffered a disaster
if a mountain thief or beast appeared.

46:31.050 --> 46:33.390
You went through all that
and got a divorce.

46:33.890 --> 46:37.820
What will you do if you die
sleeping inside such a creepy shrine?

46:39.490 --> 46:41.330
For making a grave for Bo-ri--

46:41.390 --> 46:42.900
Right, a shrine to the village deity!

46:47.700 --> 46:48.930
So that was the reason.

46:50.740 --> 46:51.870
Excuse me?

46:52.140 --> 46:53.340
I see.

46:54.770 --> 46:55.940
So you do not know.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.140
What is it this time? What do we not know?

46:58.210 --> 47:01.350
This is the very reason
I cannot help but teach you.

47:01.410 --> 47:03.320
Why? What did we--

47:04.080 --> 47:06.420
So what is it, my lord?

47:06.990 --> 47:10.590
Since ancient times,
there is an institution

47:12.260 --> 47:14.630
in which the first man to come across
the divorcee standing in front

47:15.060 --> 47:18.430
of the shrine to the village deity
has to take her as his wife in Joseon.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.130
This is called seubcheob.

47:21.470 --> 47:22.500
-Seubcheob?
-Seubcheob?

47:22.570 --> 47:25.270
In other words, if the man is a bachelor,

47:25.540 --> 47:27.710
he will have to marry the divorcee,

47:28.340 --> 47:30.140
and if he is married,

47:30.380 --> 47:33.310
he must take her as his concubine.

47:35.210 --> 47:36.420
I did not know such existed.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.380
He is right. I know what it is.
I have heard of it before.

47:40.750 --> 47:44.290
By any chance, were you waiting
here for a remarriage?

47:44.360 --> 47:47.430
What? No way. That is nonsense.

47:55.970 --> 47:58.600
I am telling you I was not!
I was simply taking a break.

47:58.670 --> 47:59.970
Seubcheob did not even cross my mind.

48:00.070 --> 48:02.910
Remarriage? Divorcing my husband
has not even sunk in yet.

48:02.980 --> 48:06.750
True. And not going through
with seubcheob should be fine.

48:06.810 --> 48:09.520
How dare you! Violating moral principles
is a serious crime!

48:10.180 --> 48:11.650
You might be dragged

48:12.150 --> 48:15.190
to the Office of Special Justice
and punished if you violate the customs.

48:16.790 --> 48:19.630
Is it that serious?

48:20.190 --> 48:21.360
That I did not know.

48:21.790 --> 48:23.760
-Laws are scary, are they not?
-Yes.

48:23.930 --> 48:25.360
I hate the thought of being punished.

48:25.460 --> 48:29.130
It is a relief nobody passed by until now.

48:29.700 --> 48:32.500
Hold on. If nobody passed by until now,

48:32.840 --> 48:34.640
-that means we are the first.
-Yes.

48:34.710 --> 48:36.640
Was Lord Yi-eon the first man
you came across as he tripped over you?

48:36.710 --> 48:37.540
Yes.

48:40.750 --> 48:44.480
Did he not say that the first man
to come across becomes her husband?

48:44.550 --> 48:46.550
That is not what I meant.
What I meant was...

48:47.320 --> 48:50.660
Then what? Do you mean

48:52.190 --> 48:56.700
she has to get remarried
to Lord Yi-eon or what?

48:57.660 --> 48:58.730
That is how it works.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.500
-I am sorry.
-What nonsense are you spouting?

49:02.900 --> 49:04.800
He is half out of his mind.

49:08.870 --> 49:10.780
What you said is ridiculous!

49:15.310 --> 49:16.650
My stomach hurts!

49:19.150 --> 49:20.890
He is hilarious!

49:43.080 --> 49:44.640
Did I do something wrong?

49:45.010 --> 49:46.680
I mean, seubcheob?

49:48.410 --> 49:49.350
It cannot be true.

49:51.250 --> 49:53.050
-Let me see.
-Please pretend it did not happen.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.550
Out of all the people in this world,

49:54.620 --> 49:57.160
-why did it have to be a divorcee?
-I cannot!

49:57.860 --> 50:00.860
-I cannot get remarried. Please!
-This cannot be.

50:00.930 --> 50:02.860
I might not be
the first man she met. I might not.

50:02.930 --> 50:05.130
-This does not count!
-I do not need to go through with it.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.230
-Right. This does not count.
-Please listen to my prayer.

50:07.670 --> 50:08.900
This does not count!

50:09.670 --> 50:11.840
How many times is he going to repeat that?

50:12.700 --> 50:13.810
Please listen to my prayer.

50:13.940 --> 50:16.780
Let us pretend it did not happen
and pretend we did not see each other.

50:16.840 --> 50:17.810
How about it?

50:17.880 --> 50:21.110
Everyone here saw it,
so how can you lie like that?

50:21.480 --> 50:25.320
"How dare you! Violating moral principles
is a serious crime!"

50:25.620 --> 50:27.520
"You might be dragged
to the Office of Special Justice"

50:27.590 --> 50:28.990
and punished if you violate the customs!

50:30.020 --> 50:31.190
That is what you said earlier.

50:31.260 --> 50:33.360
And how can a government official
paid by the country

50:33.460 --> 50:34.890
break the law?

50:37.430 --> 50:40.770
I was talking to myself.
Why are you eavesdropping?

50:43.340 --> 50:44.570
I cannot.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.410
Why does it have to me?

50:46.970 --> 50:48.740
Why did you have to be lying there?

50:50.940 --> 50:54.010
It is not like I wanted to be here either.

50:54.250 --> 50:56.420
I was lost, so I was simply taking a rest.

50:56.950 --> 51:00.490
And I could not hear you coming
because I fell asleep.

51:10.430 --> 51:14.000
In that case, why did you have to walk
to the front of the shrine?

51:14.300 --> 51:16.440
This place is open in all directions.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.640
And why did you have to trip over my legs?

51:18.800 --> 51:22.110
Are you not the one who charged toward me
while yelling at me?

51:23.340 --> 51:24.980
That was...

51:28.780 --> 51:32.150
Fine. I am sorry for stepping on your leg.

51:33.990 --> 51:36.760
But... But...

51:38.190 --> 51:40.290
I have no intention of getting married!

51:49.200 --> 51:51.470
To avoid getting married,

51:51.540 --> 51:53.970
I even took
that hateful civil service exam.

51:54.270 --> 51:56.640
My grandmother did not eat or drink
for days and got bedridden,

51:56.710 --> 52:00.010
telling me to either get married
or take the civil service exam.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.850
So out of the horrible choices I had,
I chose one that was relatively doable.

52:04.350 --> 52:07.020
-That happened, did it not?
-Yes, you do not have to ask.

52:07.590 --> 52:08.790
So do you get it?

52:09.420 --> 52:13.390
Get what the most terrifying thing
in the world is to me?

52:20.370 --> 52:21.430
Then

52:22.230 --> 52:25.400
do you know
what the most awful thing is to me?

52:28.770 --> 52:32.140
More than getting married against my will,
more than getting that tough divorce,

52:32.280 --> 52:35.010
it is getting remarried
to an arrogant and selfish man

52:35.080 --> 52:36.550
to who my heart does not skip a beat!

52:43.690 --> 52:45.020
Did she just say arrogant?

52:45.090 --> 52:46.660
She also said selfish!

52:47.430 --> 52:49.460
I totally understood. So

52:49.900 --> 52:51.960
let us not meet each other ever again!

52:52.030 --> 52:54.130
Of course.
Why would we ever meet each other again?

52:54.200 --> 52:55.600
-That is exactly what I mean!
-That is exactly what I mean!

53:02.770 --> 53:03.910
-My lord!
-My lord!

53:04.010 --> 53:05.340
-My lord!
-My lord!

53:27.630 --> 53:28.700
My lord!

53:29.100 --> 53:30.500
-Oh, no.
-Let us go!

53:30.570 --> 53:33.640
Stay still. Move and you will die.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.210
Take all they have been carrying

53:37.680 --> 53:39.850
and tie them up with a rope.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.280
-Got it.
-Got it.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.150
Identify yourselves!

53:43.950 --> 53:46.550
This one has a temper, darn it.

53:51.060 --> 53:54.090
No woman should be this strong.

53:54.290 --> 53:56.660
Her strength could match that
of a few men.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.830
Do you even know who he is?

54:03.540 --> 54:06.400
-You should know that this man--
-Is it not obvious?

54:07.170 --> 54:08.410
He must be your husband.

54:09.510 --> 54:10.540
-No!
-No!

54:11.680 --> 54:14.580
Who are you trying to kid?

54:14.880 --> 54:17.580
I heard you talking about seubcheob
and how it happens at a shrine.

54:17.820 --> 54:18.720
Was it just me?

54:18.780 --> 54:20.720
-I heard it too.
-Same here.

54:20.790 --> 54:22.850
-We are witnesses.
-I heard it too.

54:23.720 --> 54:24.720
See?

54:24.790 --> 54:27.390
How dare you play dumb
when there are these many witnesses?

54:28.030 --> 54:29.230
Just so you know,

54:31.530 --> 54:35.030
I will be kind enough
to bury you together as a married couple.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.000
Let us bury them and get going.

54:38.070 --> 54:39.100
-Got it.
-Sure thing.

54:40.740 --> 54:42.510
-Just a second.
-How dare you!

54:42.570 --> 54:44.240
-But we stayed still.
-Please.

54:44.310 --> 54:46.580
-Let go of me.
-Leave us alone!

55:03.830 --> 55:06.000
Would it not be better
to tell them your identity?

55:06.060 --> 55:08.300
Absolutely not.
It will hinder my investigation.

55:08.400 --> 55:11.300
What is with this new sense of duty
when we will soon be buried alive?

55:11.370 --> 55:13.510
Show them your horse requisition tablet
and tell them off.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.170
I cannot risk being known.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.010
-To find the culprit--
-Tell them who you are

55:18.080 --> 55:19.880
and then get on with your investigation!

55:20.010 --> 55:22.550
That defeats the purpose of being
a "secret" royal inspector.

55:24.420 --> 55:25.420
You there.

55:30.420 --> 55:34.060
Goodness, brother. Have you eaten?

55:34.390 --> 55:36.460
I have. How is your eldest?

55:36.630 --> 55:38.960
You have no idea how big
my eldest has gotten.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.230
What are you doing over there?

55:41.300 --> 55:42.700
I am digging a grave.

55:43.370 --> 55:44.800
To bury them.

55:44.870 --> 55:48.570
-I see.
-They were talking about a seubcheob,

55:48.640 --> 55:50.280
so I thought I should rob them.

55:51.010 --> 55:53.750
What are you doing out in the dark?

55:54.010 --> 55:56.450
Are you hunting
a secret royal inspector like before?

55:58.250 --> 56:00.220
Stop yapping and dig a deeper grave.

56:00.650 --> 56:02.250
I would rather not see the dead bodies.

56:02.650 --> 56:05.490
Bring anyone you see escaping
from merchants' military troops.

56:06.090 --> 56:07.790
-We are moving out.
-Yes, boss.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.290
Good hunting then!

56:10.260 --> 56:11.400
Darn it.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.430
Why are you so heavy?

56:14.500 --> 56:15.600
Darn it.

56:16.970 --> 56:18.200
The grave is ready.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.050
-Are you all right?
-What do you think?

56:33.120 --> 56:34.390
We are not fine either.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.660
They seem to be serious
about burying us alive.

56:40.390 --> 56:42.690
What do we do? Do something, my lord!

56:43.630 --> 56:45.200
Goodness.

56:45.400 --> 56:47.770
Because of the clueless master we serve,

56:47.830 --> 56:49.330
we will die as unmarried men.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.770
Master, my foot.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.240
Who cares when we are close to dying?

56:52.300 --> 56:53.370
Serving the wrong master--

56:53.440 --> 56:55.510
-You are too young to understand.
-My lord, my foot!

56:55.570 --> 56:56.980
-We cannot die as unmarried men.
-Are you kidding me?

56:57.040 --> 56:58.610
Be quiet and let me think!

57:04.120 --> 57:05.220
You there.

57:08.350 --> 57:09.390
You there!

57:10.060 --> 57:11.590
-What on earth?
-Run!

57:19.400 --> 57:21.030
What do you think that was?

57:24.500 --> 57:26.140
Did my yelling scare them off?

57:26.200 --> 57:29.210
It must be a tiger. A tiger.

57:29.270 --> 57:30.880
No way. I did not hear one.

57:30.940 --> 57:32.540
Then what could it be?

57:32.610 --> 57:34.210
You are scaring me even more.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.120
We must get out of here,
so let us be free from these ropes.

57:37.180 --> 57:38.620
Can you reach inside my robe?

57:39.920 --> 57:41.250
Yes, it has to be you.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.960
Within my robe, you will find a ruler.

57:44.020 --> 57:45.120
Hurry.

57:46.890 --> 57:48.560
We do not have the time. Hurry.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.830
Then, I hope you will excuse me.

57:59.740 --> 58:01.440
-I found it.
-What...

58:01.840 --> 58:02.770
I got it.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.050
I had it modified for such situations.

58:07.310 --> 58:08.850
Now, open it.

58:09.080 --> 58:09.980
Yes, my lord.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.280
-My gosh!
-There you go.

58:13.380 --> 58:14.590
I knew it.

58:14.650 --> 58:17.190
Do you see that, you scoundrels?

58:17.260 --> 58:19.890
Nothing is more useless
than worrying about Lord Yi-eon.

58:19.960 --> 58:22.660
Exactly. I knew our master
had a plan up his sleeve.

58:22.730 --> 58:23.830
Right, my lord?

58:25.060 --> 58:27.030
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am fine.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.100
Shall we?

58:28.500 --> 58:29.670
My lord.

58:30.300 --> 58:31.940
What about us?

58:32.640 --> 58:35.310
Why must I
when I am no longer your master?

58:36.040 --> 58:37.340
It hurts.

58:37.610 --> 58:39.440
My lord, come on.

58:42.550 --> 58:43.880
Buffoons.

58:48.250 --> 58:50.460
Okay, it is almost done.

58:52.190 --> 58:53.490
Nice!

58:54.730 --> 58:55.730
All right.

58:56.060 --> 58:57.360
Goodness.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.700
We can do this.

59:03.640 --> 59:04.700
My gosh.

59:07.940 --> 59:08.940
Come on!

59:26.090 --> 59:27.030
Gosh.

59:44.510 --> 59:45.680
Grab it.

59:47.910 --> 59:49.150
Grab it already.

59:50.550 --> 59:51.650
Please climb up.

59:54.220 --> 59:55.520
Come on.

1:00:02.790 --> 1:00:03.830
My gosh.

1:00:09.970 --> 1:00:11.970
Your grip is stronger
than the average man's.

1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:14.610
You put our master to shame.

1:00:15.370 --> 1:00:16.980
You try carrying water, washing clothes,

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:18.440
carrying meal trays,
and doing household chores.

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:19.840
Your grip will strengthen in no time.

1:00:19.910 --> 1:00:21.210
Household chores do that?

1:00:21.310 --> 1:00:23.580
Stop yapping up there and help me.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:24.820
Help me up!

1:00:57.150 --> 1:00:58.180
Over there!

1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:07.930
-What is the matter?
-My lord, over there.

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:14.400
What...

1:01:33.150 --> 1:01:34.520
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.170
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk and Song Jong-ho
for their special appearance.]

1:01:48.430 --> 1:01:50.970
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

1:01:51.570 --> 1:01:53.270
[If we do not get rid of
the secret royal inspector,]

1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:54.410
[he will end up discovering everything.]

1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:56.610
[My mother was also a woman
who returned home after being taken.]

1:01:56.970 --> 1:01:58.510
[I would like to help in any way I can.]

1:01:58.710 --> 1:02:00.140
[Those colluding with
the merchants' military troops]

1:02:00.210 --> 1:02:01.350
[have control over the village.]

1:02:01.410 --> 1:02:03.010
[The law is useless there.]

1:02:03.350 --> 1:02:05.020
[But they are lunatics.]

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:06.820
[We must obtain conclusive evidence.]

1:02:07.050 --> 1:02:09.390
[Sweetheart, where could you be from?]

1:02:09.590 --> 1:02:11.820
[A girl like her
should be taught a lesson.]

1:02:11.990 --> 1:02:13.490
[Do not insult my wife.]

1:02:13.790 --> 1:02:16.130
[And who may you be?
I doubt you are one like us.]

1:02:16.290 --> 1:02:19.000
[Who are you? Tell me who you are!]
