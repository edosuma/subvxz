00:03.760 --> 00:06.240
Carol:
I can see you.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.285
Come out. Slowly.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.091
- ( Metal creaking )
- ( dripping )

00:13.280 --> 00:16.602
Man: Yeah, I think
I'm gonna pass on that.

( faint shouting )

01:55.560 --> 01:57.369
Tobin:
Carol?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.682
You here?

02:02.760 --> 02:05.366
Carol:
Upstairs.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.409
- How are you?
- Happy to see you.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.131
( Groans )

02:15.320 --> 02:16.526
What happened?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.728
Oh, I just slipped.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.406
Building a new guard tower.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.006
I went to the infirmary.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.407
It's so quiet over there now.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.241
I knew Denise since the beginning.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.803
She wasn't around much
before Pete, but...

02:35.960 --> 02:39.282
before that,
she just stayed inside.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.206
She was always--
was always reading something.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.250
And she really stepped up
when she had to.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.402
( Tobin's voice fading )
She was there for us...

02:48.600 --> 02:51.604
( Tobin's voice murmuring )

03:00.760 --> 03:02.489
I didn't mean to bring it up.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.008
No, it's just--

03:06.200 --> 03:09.602
I just keep thinking about Tara,
when she finds out.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.171
Ah.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.086
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.571
Yeah.

No, no, no, no.

- Yeah? Why not?
- No.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.567
Maggie has us on a schedule

07:49.720 --> 07:53.327
and I'm not pissing off
a pregnant lady.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.531
Yeah.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.968
- Not that pregnant lady.
- Right.

- Go.
- ( chuckles )

08:14.280 --> 08:17.523
When they come for us,
we'll end it,

08:17.720 --> 08:19.563
the whole thing.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.963
This won't be like before.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.326
We're putting everything in place

08:24.520 --> 08:26.522
and these people know
what to do now.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.727
The world's ours,

08:31.880 --> 08:33.928
and we know how to take it.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.091
Everything we need

08:42.240 --> 08:45.608
is right here inside these walls.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.210
And we're not losing
any of it again.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.251
- I'm not.
- No, you're not.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.365
( Rick munches apple )

09:00.960 --> 09:02.962
I'm not.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.281
Maggie: We'll have these,
but we should hide a few.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.966
That way, we can find them,
but strangers can't.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.929
In case anyone gets in.

09:20.640 --> 09:21.971
They won't.

( Motorcycle revving )

09:24.280 --> 09:25.406
Oh, no.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.289
Where are you going?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.805
Out.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.689
No shit.
You got specifics?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.922
What the hell is he doing?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.730
Something he shouldn't.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.008
We gotta stop him.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.167
( Engine starts )

09:59.320 --> 10:00.367
- Whoa!
- ( brakes squeal )

10:00.520 --> 10:01.760
Make room for my freckled ass.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.843
No.
Cover my watch.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.246
You stay.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.925
Hey, we should keep
numbers here.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.963
I know where Daryl's going.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.682
( Door closes )

10:26.760 --> 10:28.205
( knock on door)

10:40.960 --> 10:42.724
What time did she leave?
Do you know what she took?

10:42.880 --> 10:44.450
Sometime in the night.
I never heard her go,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.045
but she made a bunch
of food, you know.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.362
- She took her pack, one of my coats--
- Did she leave on foot?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.124
L-- I don't know.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.124
Sasha: Rick, I took over at 12:00,
I was on till 6:00.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.725
I never saw anything.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.241
Front's been quiet
since the others left.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.845
- What? Who?
- Daryl.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.241
He went ICBM
after the Saviors from yesterday.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.689
Glenn, Michonne, Rosita,
they all went to shut that shit down.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.242
Tobin:
Where's the other car?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.641
We added two more cars
yesterday.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.406
One of them's missing, the one
we put right between those houses.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.006
You can barely see
between the houses from up top,

11:17.160 --> 11:18.286
especially at night.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.444
Morgan:
The note-- can I see it?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.887
You never saw
any headlights, taillights?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.361
She's smart enough
to cover her tracks.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.330
Sasha: She must've left
during the shift change.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.723
- Where are you going?
- Morgan: I'm gonna go find her.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.365
Wait.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.886
Tell Carl I'll be back soon.
No one else leaves.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.963
Everyone stays ready
for a fight.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.248

( panting )

13:01.320 --> 13:02.970
( engine stops )

13:15.840 --> 13:17.968
Hands up.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.731
Please don't hurt me.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.248
Why does everyone
always assume the worst?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.448
How 'bout you come on out?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.648
I just have the car.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.082
And a knife for the dead ones,
nothing else.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.802
Naw, you got information.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.043
Like where you're from,
where you're going.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.047
Aw, come on, it's a lonely world.
Let's get to know each other.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.208
I'm Jiro.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.567
Your turn.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.166
I'm nobody, really.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.281
Nancy from Montclair.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.688
But I've bounced around
a lot since then.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.008
L-- I keep moving.

14:27.880 --> 14:32.044
I'm not really from anywhere.
I'm not really going anywhere.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.531
Jiro:
Well...

14:33.720 --> 14:37.611
at least we agree on one thing,
Nancy from Montclair--

14:37.760 --> 14:41.048
you're not going anywhere.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.966
But you do seem
like you're from somewhere.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.249
After Montclair, right?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.641
Miles, what's that place called?

14:50.800 --> 14:54.691
The gated one
12.75 clicks down?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.649
Miles:
Alexandria.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.565
Yeah, Alexandria.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.166
You know, they got some cars
out front, spikes through them,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.926
just like the one you're driving.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.810
A woman like you,

15:07.960 --> 15:10.930
no weapons, no protection,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.651
no clue...

15:13.800 --> 15:17.009
you really shouldn't be
out here alone.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.527
You know, we were
just on our way to your place.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.682
We can give you a ride back.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.162
Maybe they'll let us in
if you're with us.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.208
( Panting )

15:41.440 --> 15:44.489
( Carol continues panting )

15:50.560 --> 15:52.881
( sobbing )

15:56.880 --> 15:58.291
It doesn't have to be this way.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.329
You could turn back
and you could go home.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.285
Nobody has to get hurt.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.687
It's looking like someone's
gotta get hurt.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.411
Please.
(whimpers )

16:10.560 --> 16:11.891
Please.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.644
Man, why don't you just
grab her before she passes out?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.565
( Sobbing )

16:16.720 --> 16:18.529
Carol:
Don't, please!

16:18.680 --> 16:21.524
( Automatic gunfire rattles )

( clicks, sizzles )

17:03.560 --> 17:05.608
(grunts)

17:30.400 --> 17:34.564
I can see you.
Come out... slowly.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.564
Jiro: Yeah, I think
I'm gonna pass on that.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.322
( Truck creaking )

17:47.520 --> 17:49.727
( trickling )

17:51.640 --> 17:53.005
( knife rings )

17:55.840 --> 17:58.764
- ( Jiro yells)
- ( gunshot echoes )

18:00.800 --> 18:03.644
(dripping)

18:12.520 --> 18:14.090
- Enid: Hey.
- Hey.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.840
- You look tired.
- We still have a lot to do.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.810
Glenn, Michonne, and Rosita
just took off after Daryl.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.086
I'm taking an extra shift.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.402
Just packing a lunch
before I go back out.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.282
- See you later.
- Where are you going?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.885
Take your shift while you rest.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.042
Enid...

18:38.200 --> 18:40.168
Just for a few hours.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.804
Let me help.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.691
Put up your feet
and eat some pickles.

18:46.840 --> 18:51.289
( Door opens, closes )

18:57.680 --> 19:00.570
You didn't have to come.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.406
We have to try,
even if it's a long shot,

19:04.560 --> 19:06.244
even if it's dangerous.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.488
Tire tracks pointed east...

19:12.040 --> 19:14.088
we go east.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.561
Saviors' compound
that you and the group--

19:17.960 --> 19:20.201
that you went to,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.089
that was west.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.728
Seems like she went east.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.441
You don't even know Carol.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.762
Oh, I got to.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.763
A little.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.489
Why are you doing this?

19:55.080 --> 19:59.290
What I believe-- I'm not right.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.047
There is no right.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.806
There's just the wrong
that doesn't pull you down.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.282
It hasn't pulled me down.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.962
I think it will.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.960
'Cause I know you.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.964
( Sighs )

20:32.360 --> 20:34.169
(groaning )

20:34.320 --> 20:35.924
God dang--!

20:38.480 --> 20:41.324
( Man whimpers)

20:41.480 --> 20:44.006
Oh, man.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.402
(groaning )

21:02.520 --> 21:04.727
Shh.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.370
Shh!

21:08.360 --> 21:11.443
Just let it go, man.
Just let go.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.243
Oh, God.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.402
- Morgan: There.
- I see it.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.129
( Jiro panting )

22:01.120 --> 22:03.521
Rick:
That's her car.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.844
You see her?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.442
Morgan:
No.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.766
- Hey, where is she?
- ( gurgles )

22:49.240 --> 22:52.767
The Saviors were getting weapons
from the Hilltop's blacksmith.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.763
These men were Saviors.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.490
(growling )

23:10.000 --> 23:11.684
There's blood here.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.962
She could've been hit.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.641
Rick:
I'm proud of her.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.167
How's that?

23:25.320 --> 23:28.802
She took four of 'em down.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.008
That woman,
she's a force of nature.

23:31.160 --> 23:35.006
She left because she can't anymore.
That's what her letter said.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.687
She could because she had to.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.330
Sometimes you have to.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.289
There's more blood
opposite these men

23:46.480 --> 23:48.448
that leads into the field.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.001
It's a trail.
Could be Carol's.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.889
She could still be alive.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.610
She's not here.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.683
Most of their guns are gone.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.242
- She might've taken them.
- Those, too.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.562
( Sighs )

24:02.720 --> 24:06.281
Or she could've died here,

24:06.440 --> 24:08.920
even if she isn't here.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.162
Trail goes this way.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.771
Rick:
They were close to Alexandria.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.208
There's even more of them.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.045
We didn't end it.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.567
Morgan:
No.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.609
You started something.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.008
( Snarling )

25:47.280 --> 25:48.691
-( blade rings)
- ( snarling stops )

25:48.840 --> 25:51.207
That's where she died.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.642
All right, so he had
to start from here.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.531
He did.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.728
Which way did Dwight run?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.162
Rosita?

26:14.920 --> 26:16.649
We should let him do this.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.811
But he doesn't know
what he's doing.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.566
We don't.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.451
Maybe him trying this makes you
feel better about it right now.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.201
Maybe they keep knowing more
about us than we know about them.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.689
Or maybe Daryl's
gonna get himself killed.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.368
Which way did Dwight run?

27:17.320 --> 27:20.130
( Rustling )

27:24.040 --> 27:26.247
(thumps)

27:29.480 --> 27:30.811
Rosita:
Watch the hell out, asshole.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.570
I did.
You shouldn't have come.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.404
Michonne:
You shouldn't have left.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.881
When I split off
from Sasha and Abraham,

27:39.040 --> 27:41.520
he was out there in the woods, in that
burned-out forest with them girls,

27:41.720 --> 27:44.929
put a gun to my head,
tied me up.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.171
I even tried to help him.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.766
Glenn:
So, you think it's your fault?

27:50.920 --> 27:53.241
Yeah, I know it is.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.805
I'm gonna go do
what I should've done before.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.691
What, for her?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.286
She's gone, man.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.681
You're doing this for you.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.046
Man, I don't give a shit.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.049
Daryl...?

28:07.760 --> 28:11.526
We need to get back there
and figure this out from home.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.286
Our home.

28:14.440 --> 28:18.126
We need you, and everyone
back there needs us right now.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.406
It's-- it's gonna go wrong
out here.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.282
We'll square it. I will.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.205
I promise you.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.089
Just come back.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.843
I can't.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.002
- Daryl.
- Man, I can't!

28:49.560 --> 28:51.927
I can't either.

29:10.280 --> 29:14.330
Glenn: Thing is, those men
could be back in Alexandria right now.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.411
- Michonne: If they are, they're dead.
- I hope not.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.848
We need them alive.
We need to find out more.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.731
Michonne:
Yeah, we do.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.801
We just got stuck
with each other.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.526
We were lucky.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.928
We figured it all out
together.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.569
It felt like we did.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.366
After everything, we did.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.562
The world's not
what we thought it was.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.724
Hilltop, the Saviors, it's bigger.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.769
( Man whistles )

30:06.920 --> 30:08.570
( rifle clicks )

30:08.720 --> 30:11.769
- ( man whistles )
- ( rifle clicks )

30:11.920 --> 30:14.321
( man whistles )

30:27.400 --> 30:29.562
Hi.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.610
It's not much.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.441
But if it's Carol's, then she's
been bleeding for a while.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.247
Morgan: So, you out here
because Carol is your friend?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.688
I'm out here
'cause she's my family.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.522
Morgan:
I've talked to people back there.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.446
I found out about
what happened at the prison.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.841
How you sent her away.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.929
She killed
two of your people, right?

31:36.120 --> 31:37.963
Burned their bodies.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.610
What if that
had happened today?

31:42.760 --> 31:44.171
Would you kill her?

31:44.320 --> 31:47.324
If it happened today,
I'd thank her.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.687
Or I would've
killed them myself.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.360
She was right to do it.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.488
They were sick,
spreading a disease.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.047
They weren't gonna make it.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.328
Yeah, but this was back then.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.330
And you didn't kill her.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.161
You sent her away, Rick,
and she came back.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.443
And she came back
and she saved all y'all.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.331
People can come back, Rick.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.450
(walker growling )

32:35.520 --> 32:37.682
Rick:
It's not her.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.851
(grunts)

32:46.720 --> 32:49.405
Morgan: She couldn't have
been dead more than a day.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.808
( Distant creaking )

33:12.680 --> 33:14.603
( snarling )

33:16.920 --> 33:17.921
- Hey!
- ( hammer clicks )

33:18.080 --> 33:19.605
Whoa, whoa!

33:19.760 --> 33:21.410
- It's okay. I'm not trouble.
- ( door closes )

33:21.600 --> 33:22.601
I don't want any trouble.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.240
Come out, drop your weapons.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.090
Man:
I can't do that.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.083
The wasted are too close.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.766
I'm just looking for my horse.
Have you seen him?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.604
No.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.807
We're looking for our friend.
Have you seen her?

33:37.960 --> 33:40.327
- Morgan: Have you seen her?
- ( walkers snarling )

33:40.480 --> 33:41.845
Man:
They're coming!

33:42.040 --> 33:44.441
Just go! Just go!

33:46.440 --> 33:48.966
( Door opens )

33:49.120 --> 33:50.360
3110p!

33:51.960 --> 33:53.325
( Walkers snarling )

34:06.240 --> 34:08.322
( panting )

34:13.639 --> 34:15.130
Rick.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.560
We didn't know who he was.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.282
Yeah, it's one of the Hilltop's.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.726
Like the one on the road.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.201
Maybe he's one of 'em.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.010
Maybe he's looking
for Carol, too.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.083
Maybe the man
is just looking for a horse.

34:30.239 --> 34:33.527
Maybe he is from Hilltop.
Maybe he's from somewhere else.

34:38.639 --> 34:43.043
I don't take chances...
anymore.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.362
Those people...

34:56.679 --> 35:00.207
the Wolves...

35:00.360 --> 35:02.681
after they attacked,
I found one of them.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.521
He had attacked me
on the road before--

35:07.680 --> 35:11.480
when I was trying to find you--
And I stopped him.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.685
But I let him live.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.281
And then he was there in Alexandria
after the attack,

35:19.440 --> 35:22.330
hiding in one of the brownstones,
so I stopped him again.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.643
I knocked him out
and I could have killed him.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.881
But all life is precious.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.962
Put him in the cell
of the brownstone basement.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.411
'Cause I knew
he could change.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.085
We all can change.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.163
You had one of them alive
in the community?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.243
Oh, yeah.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.402
And when the walls came down
and the walkers broke in,

35:55.560 --> 35:57.403
Carol found out.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.767
We fought,
and that man escaped,

35:59.920 --> 36:01.570
and Denise...

36:03.520 --> 36:05.409
she had come to the cell
to try and help him

36:05.600 --> 36:08.490
and he took her hostage.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.126
And then she and that Wolf,

36:11.280 --> 36:13.442
they got swarmed,

36:13.600 --> 36:16.080
and that man, that killer,

36:16.240 --> 36:19.403
he saved her life.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.370
And then Denise
was there to save Carl.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.000
It--

36:25.200 --> 36:27.168
it's all a circle.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.324
Everything gets a return.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.604
But the fact is the fact.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.280
I did what I did.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.647
I let him live.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.611
You go home, Rick.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.843
You take the car.
You're needed back there.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.002
You shouldn't be out here
taking any more chances.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.323
I'm not leaving.
Carol's still out here.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.007
And I will find her.
Somehow.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.449
You go.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.491
You're coming back.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.527
Yeah.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.326
But if I don't,
don't come looking.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.162
Take it.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.687
- No, I--
- Take it.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.368
Morgan?

37:55.840 --> 37:58.650
Michonne did steal
that protein bar.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.087
Oh, I know.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.407
Morgan's still out there
looking.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.324
Is Michonne here?

38:33.640 --> 38:35.563
She's still out there, too.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.971
You afraid...

38:50.120 --> 38:52.248
to go back to it?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.321
Let somebody close?

39:04.160 --> 39:07.403
Yeah. Yeah.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.084
Mm.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.680
Me, too.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.161
But now...

39:21.400 --> 39:22.765
I think I'm
that much more ready

39:22.960 --> 39:25.566
to tear the world
a brand-new asshole.

39:25.720 --> 39:29.281
( Both chuckle )

39:37.680 --> 39:39.967
Any second now.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.201
Yeah.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.606
Any second.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.803
( Knocks )

40:10.560 --> 40:13.211
Scott said you were
looking for me?

40:13.360 --> 40:15.169
What's up?

40:17.760 --> 40:19.762
I need some more help.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.447
(faint snip)

40:35.840 --> 40:37.444
Enid:
I like it.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.125
But Why?

40:39.280 --> 40:41.851
( Sighs )

40:42.040 --> 40:44.805
Hmm.
I have to keep going.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.805
And I don't want anything
getting in my way.

40:57.960 --> 41:00.042
- ( Exhales )
- Man, did I go too short?

41:00.200 --> 41:02.601
L-I only used to cut my dad's.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.728
No, it's not that.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.800
Maggie?

41:08.960 --> 41:11.008
Ah!

41:12.600 --> 41:14.762
Maggie.
