00:38.320 --> 00:41.424
And last but not least, to Susan
"The Steamroller" Purtree

00:41.520 --> 00:43.304
for putting this all together.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.225
And now, finally, at long last,
as some of you may be saying,

00:50.320 --> 00:54.470
it is my honor, my privilege,
my personal pleasure

00:54.520 --> 00:56.907
to present to you the
man of every hour,

00:56.960 --> 01:01.031
University of Perth's own
Professor Edgar Solomon.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.144
Hear, hear!

01:13.440 --> 01:15.907
Thank you. Sincerely.

01:21.720 --> 01:27.748
A bear taking a dump
asked a rabbit,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.949
"Does shit stick to
your fur as a habit?"

01:33.040 --> 01:35.188
"Of course not," said the hare,

01:35.280 --> 01:39.305
"it's really quite rare,"

01:39.360 --> 01:42.828
so the bear wiped his
ass with the rabbit.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.747
There once was a lady named Dot...

01:51.960 --> 01:55.303
who lived off of pig shit and snot.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.944
When she ran out of these,
she ate the green cheese...

02:02.760 --> 02:05.784
that she grew on the sides...

02:06.320 --> 02:10.026
of her twat.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.227
Oh, my God.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.470
Are you all right? You OK?

02:17.520 --> 02:20.783
- I'm so sorry.
- OK.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.943
Edgar? What are
you doing? Oh, my...!

02:44.080 --> 02:46.467
Stop!

02:46.560 --> 02:49.106
- Hands over your head, sir!
- Just one moment.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.821
Please, sir, don't
reach in your jacket!

05:10.680 --> 05:14.023
I'm calling on behalf of
AAMQ debt acquisitions,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.791
regarding the balance on
your LBF Platinum card...

05:18.040 --> 05:20.427
This is an attempt
to collect a debt.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.344
If you do not pay your
outstanding bill...

05:22.400 --> 05:25.071
your power will be cut off
by noon Friday, July...

05:25.120 --> 05:28.588
Hello? Hi, I'm here. And I might
be able to pay you today.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.465
I think I'm about to
get some good news.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.624
- I think you're gonna get it.
- Oh, stop jinxing it.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.067
- It's unjinxable. You got it.
- Stop saying that.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.190
- Too bad.
- Just tie my lucky tie.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.463
Senior sales representative.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.863
Honey, when's the last time Kopeckny
asked you in for a meeting one on one?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.546
- Never.
- So there.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.830
If I get this promotion, we
are so going on a honeymoon.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.223
Who needs a honeymoon?
After this weekend we'll be married.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.189
You'll ask, "Where's the remote?"

06:03.240 --> 06:06.981
But I mean like a husband asking
his wife where is the remote.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.465
- Thank you.
- Hey.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.860
- Yes?
- What about the kid?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.864
The kid.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.385
Geez.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.943
All right. Senior sales
representative, here I come!

06:23.200 --> 06:27.828
Sir, I'm just trying to understand.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.427
You're firing me?

06:32.440 --> 06:36.829
I made more sales
than ever last month.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.551
And you're still not producing.
What does that tell you?

06:40.520 --> 06:43.021
Explain to me what
happened yesterday.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.181
I made the sale.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.581
The woman was interested
in the gold plan.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.629
- You talked her out of it.
- Wh...

06:48.720 --> 06:51.471
You talked her out
of the gold plan.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.909
I sold Ms. Palmer a policy that was
appropriate to her age and income.

06:55.960 --> 07:00.145
I didn't feel like I should
take advantage... of her.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.860
That's what we do here?

07:04.160 --> 07:07.184
- We take advantage of people?
- No. No, not at all.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.781
- That's not what I meant.
- I got it.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.103
- Sir...
- No, I got it. I do, really.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.780
We shame you. You're
too pure for this job.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.262
Please, I cannot lose this
job right now. Sir...

07:20.040 --> 07:23.223
My brother is mentally disabled,
and if I lose this job,

07:23.280 --> 07:25.679
I'm going to lose my insurance.
And if I lose my insurance,

07:25.680 --> 07:27.225
I'm not gonna be able to
afford his outpatient care

07:27.280 --> 07:30.463
and they're gonna
re-institutionalize him.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.667
Sounds like you have a lot
of people depending on you.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.660
You got this brother.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.184
You're getting married,
having a baby.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.510
Yeah.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.063
You realize the same things
that make you a lousy salesman

07:56.160 --> 07:58.911
are going to fuck
you up as a father?

07:58.960 --> 08:01.267
Or a husband, for that matter.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.785
I mean, you're marrying this girl.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.387
She's marrying someone who
refuses to get his hands dirty,

08:06.440 --> 08:08.508
who lacks the balls

08:08.560 --> 08:12.984
to ever really lay it on the
line for her or her child.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.349
If you think I'm being unfair,
tell me to go to hell.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.265
Like a man. Huh?

08:27.440 --> 08:31.465
Mm-mm-mm...

08:31.520 --> 08:34.828
Vince... get him out of here.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.381
No, no, no. OK, 'cause...

08:42.919 --> 08:45.591
they'll send me back to Bayview.

08:45.640 --> 08:50.507
And I can't go back to Bayview. They
lock the doors on you at Bayview.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.665
- I know.
- Then you have to say a promise to me,

08:54.760 --> 08:57.181
that you promise me I don't
have to go back there.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.787
Like, "I promise," well,
"I promise you, Michael,

09:00.840 --> 09:03.227
you don't have to go
back there to Bayview."

09:03.280 --> 09:07.271
You have to say that to me.
You have to promise me.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.022
OK.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.071
OK. You take the elevator
and I'll take the stairs

09:20.160 --> 09:22.183
and I'll meet you
like in five seconds!

09:26.240 --> 09:29.264
I know it's only a day
away, but is there any way

09:29.320 --> 09:32.344
to move the rehearsal dinner
into maybe a smaller room?

09:32.400 --> 09:35.106
The Cypress Room's already
our most economical.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.264
There's a number of affordable
motor inns all along the highway.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.424
No! It's just, things have come up.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.742
- I have to take this.
- Hello?

09:45.480 --> 09:48.504
Dad, why didn't you show me this?

09:48.560 --> 09:51.106
I could've at least been
looking for a place for you!

09:51.160 --> 09:56.187
What kind of nigger paradise do you
think you're going to move me into?

09:56.280 --> 09:59.782
I'm not gonna live among Bantus.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.951
I'm gonna have to move in
with you. We both know it.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.461
- Dad.
- Oh, I know. I'm a blight.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.271
This is why you should
have made more money.

10:10.320 --> 10:15.586
You sealed all our fates when you
settled on a liberal arts major.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.109
Mythology and Folklore. What
the fuck were you thinking?

10:20.160 --> 10:24.265
- If I just had more time.
- You had 15 years by my count.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.900
Fifteen years to find
something you were good at.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.906
By the time I was your age,
I'd amassed a fortune so huge,

10:30.960 --> 10:36.226
it took decades of dedicated
self-destruction to wind up like this.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.469
Dad, you know we already have
Michael living with us...

10:39.520 --> 10:41.861
- Leave me alone.
- And the baby on the way.

10:41.920 --> 10:47.948
My bowels are finally moving. Let me
savor these last little victories.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.187
Your father despises me, Elliot.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.901
Shelby, I know how hard this is
gonna be on everybody. I know that.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.631
Then why did you tell him yes?

11:08.680 --> 11:11.386
Hey, Ellie, do you remember
when Dad would always...

11:11.480 --> 11:14.060
was always saying he was
going to have a man

11:14.120 --> 11:16.188
from the orphanage
to come and get us?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.866
And we never knew why that
was going to be a punishment

11:18.920 --> 11:22.342
to get to live away from him.
Do you remember that?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.104
Yeah, I remember.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.031
Well, that's not even
an option anymore.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.621
Do you remember Deborah, who
lived across the street, Ellie?

11:31.680 --> 11:35.990
Well, I wonder if she's still alive.
She's probably still alive, Ellie.

11:36.040 --> 11:41.067
She wouldn't be that old. She'd be
maybe 57 now. That's not that old.

11:53.800 --> 11:58.110
Ellie, can you give me a ride
to Joe Burger? I took my pill.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.548
OK? I just... I took
my pill already.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.988
Well, I can't go back to
Hot Dog Castle right now

12:05.040 --> 12:07.461
'cause things just got
very unpleasant there.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.783
OK? Well...

12:10.840 --> 12:13.864
- Don't go faster, Ellie.
- I won't.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.631
- Just don't do that.
- I won't. I'm not.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.465
Just stay there.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.864
Well, yeah, because he knows
that Marisol likes me

12:23.920 --> 12:27.342
and there's sometimes when
she is at the counter,

12:27.400 --> 12:31.949
we'll make... we'll make eyes
at each other sometimes.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.421
Is that what people say, to
"make eyes at each other"?

12:34.520 --> 12:38.227
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, to make eyes. Well...

12:38.280 --> 12:40.109
I think that Shelby is like Mom.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.423
When she was alive, she was poor.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.787
You don't think about
that, but they were.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.942
Dad didn't make his
money until later

12:48.000 --> 12:53.106
and he didn't start to be
mean until later. So, yeah.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.866
Bye.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.266
What the fuck?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.831
- Hello?
- Mr. Elliot Brindle?

13:52.880 --> 13:55.187
- Yes?
- Congratulations.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.104
You have been selected
for the opportunity

13:57.160 --> 14:00.662
to take part in a
one-of-a-kind game show!

14:00.720 --> 14:02.026
- Uh, look...
- Of a long list of candidates

14:02.080 --> 14:06.822
in financial need, you have been chosen
to compete for a fantastic cash prize.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.719
I think you may have
dialed the wrong number.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.629
Elliot Brindle, age 32.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.148
Your mother was killed in a car
accident when you were nine.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.507
Ever since, you've felt
responsible for your brother,

14:16.560 --> 14:19.470
whose outpatient care
cost you $1,200 a month.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.545
Add that to $90,000 in student
loans and credit card debt,

14:23.600 --> 14:26.510
- no wonder you have trouble sleeping.
- Who is this?

14:26.560 --> 14:30.221
You always mean well, but follow-through
has often been a problem.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.987
Like today, you somehow were
unable to protect your fiancee

14:34.040 --> 14:37.189
from having a vindictive old
racist move in with her.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.503
- What do you want?
- You can't honestly even say

14:40.560 --> 14:43.664
you put up much of a fight on
that one, can you, Mr. Brindle?

14:43.720 --> 14:45.185
OK, I'm gonna hang up now.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.907
And at this moment, you are
being defeated by a fly.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.704
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Brindle.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.387
All that matters is the
challenge I put before you now.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.827
Swat the fly.

14:59.880 --> 15:03.541
If you kill the fly,
$1000 will be instantly

15:03.600 --> 15:08.342
credited to your Nola Bank
account number 5366286.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.985
Shit.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.107
If you wish to proceed, we have
another challenge for you,

15:44.160 --> 15:48.549
no more complicated than
the first. Are you ready?

15:49.280 --> 15:52.463
- Swallow the fly you just killed.
- What?

15:52.520 --> 15:57.387
If you eat the fly,
$3,622 will be credited

15:57.440 --> 16:01.261
to your account, exactly what
Shelby owes on her MasterCard.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.629
That would be a nice wedding
gift for her, wouldn't it?

17:22.119 --> 17:26.111
Well done. You have
completed challenge two.

17:26.160 --> 17:31.869
$3,622 has been credited
to your Nola bank account.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.581
Jesus. You're watching me now?

17:35.640 --> 17:39.586
You can have your privacy
back right now, if you like.

17:39.640 --> 17:44.541
But I must tell you, great
wealth is within your grasp.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.022
Thirty-six hours from now,
you can be a very rich man.

17:48.080 --> 17:52.310
All you have to do is
complete 13 challenges.

17:52.360 --> 17:56.351
You've already completed
two, so only 11 more to go.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.982
Please make sure you are
alone, entirely alone,

18:00.040 --> 18:02.347
as I relate to you the rules.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.628
There are 11 more challenges.

18:04.680 --> 18:09.183
For each one you complete, the
cash prizes will grow in value.

18:09.240 --> 18:14.904
If you complete challenge 13, you
will claim a life-changing fortune.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.064
Our last winner took
home 6.2 million.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.143
Six point two million dollars?

18:20.240 --> 18:21.865
If you fail to
complete a challenge,

18:21.920 --> 18:25.229
the game will end and you
will lose everything,

18:25.280 --> 18:28.145
including any money you
have won to that point.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.622
There are two other
ways the game can end.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.465
One, tell anyone you
are playing the game.

18:34.520 --> 18:39.467
Two, attempt to contact or in any
way interfere with the game.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.066
- Why me?
- Everything will be revealed to you

18:42.120 --> 18:44.029
at the appropriate time.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.706
If you understand the rules
and wish to continue,

18:46.760 --> 18:49.670
please press one to
register your entry.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.825
- Otherwise, press two, end the game.
- El?

18:56.600 --> 18:59.988
Mr. Brindle?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.630
Did you just slam the
door in my face?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.066
No.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.144
- Congratulations, Elliot Brindle.
- Elliot...

19:12.200 --> 19:15.509
You are now a
registered contestant.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.301
Now, please, face forward and say,

19:19.360 --> 19:23.306
"I will dance with a golden toad."

19:27.440 --> 19:30.350
- I will dance with a golden toad.
- Excellent!

19:30.400 --> 19:32.582
Get a good night's sleep,
and in the morning,

19:32.640 --> 19:36.950
be sure to wear a comfortable
pair of walking shoes.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.061
Who was that?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.870
- It's a surprise.
- Hm.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.506
Everything will be revealed to
you at the appropriate time.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.106
OK. Mm-hm.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.069
Now, back to bed.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.107
You know, when Shelby was little...

20:26.200 --> 20:27.301
Mom!

20:27.360 --> 20:31.704
she used to always go on about
the wedding she was gonna have,

20:31.760 --> 20:34.943
and it always got bigger.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.983
By the time she was 12,

20:37.040 --> 20:41.509
she was riding in at the head
of a parade of elephants...

20:43.200 --> 20:45.826
- attended by six eunuchs!
- I've since amended that.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.745
Give me one second.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.507
- Hello?
- Good morning, Mr. Brindle.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.668
This is challenge three of 13.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.302
For $5,000, make a child cry.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.468
- What?
- You have five minutes.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.827
- What?
- We wish you luck.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.187
Elliot?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.782
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.509
- And now I gotta urinate.
- Right.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.946
I'll just post it on Facebook.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.383
We can put out a proper
press release later.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.502
Hey...

21:59.480 --> 22:03.301
- Your mommy doesn't love you.
- Yes, she does.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.189
They don't want to let you know,
but the man from the orphanage

22:05.240 --> 22:06.466
is coming to take you away.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.670
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.670
That's what they're
talking about right now.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.583
It's because of what you did.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.260
Mommy! Mommy!

22:26.560 --> 22:29.982
I'm so sorry!

22:30.040 --> 22:31.585
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong, sweetie?

22:31.640 --> 22:35.711
OK, so we're off? Let me get that.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.147
- OK.
- Thank you.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.261
- I got it.
- Bye, Dad!

22:41.320 --> 22:46.586
If you want, I can just go pick my dad
up myself and drop you off at home.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.823
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.187
We're not even married yet,
and it's already started?

22:52.240 --> 22:53.705
- Women, right?
- Hey!

22:54.200 --> 22:56.109
What the...?

22:56.160 --> 22:58.660
How fucking dare you!
What kind of a pervert are you?

22:58.680 --> 23:01.380
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Sick, twisted...!

23:01.440 --> 23:04.225
- Whoa! Baby, stop, stop!
- The fuck is wrong with you?!

23:04.320 --> 23:06.104
Fuck you!

23:24.080 --> 23:25.580
He's right there.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.740
- I'm not loving this new ringtone.
- I'm sorry.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.949
This next one is worth $10,000!

23:37.000 --> 23:39.023
Challenge four of 13.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.946
We'd like to draw your
attention to a nativity scene.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.344
Handcrafted in darkness by the children
of the Chabert Home for the Blind.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.989
- Hey, Bill, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm fuckin' ready.

23:52.040 --> 23:55.428
What do you think? I gotta
piss like a racehorse.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.424
- OK.
- We wish you luck.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.947
You can't be serious.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.989
The baby was a miscalculation.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.861
Elliot's already collapsing
under the weight of it.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.307
You'll get tired of
propping him up.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.349
Years go by,

24:16.400 --> 24:20.903
and your bitterness will grow
in proportion to your ass.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.424
Come here and give me a hand.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.901
With my zipper, please.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.791
My arthritis.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.066
Fuck.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.024
I'm wondering what Elliot's
told you about his mother.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.150
He told you I was driving?

25:33.200 --> 25:36.065
- He told you that, at least.
- Uh-huh.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.269
- I know he thinks I was drinking.
- Were you?

25:39.320 --> 25:43.027
I was in a hurry. I was a
busy man in those days.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.706
Things to do, an empire to build.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.511
I couldn't slow down for anything.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.583
Least of all a telephone pole.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.501
Fuck!

26:09.080 --> 26:11.786
- Do you hear that? The fire alarm?
- Hm?

26:11.880 --> 26:13.744
No, I didn't. Sorry.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.863
- Hello?
- Mr. Brindle!

26:23.920 --> 26:26.944
I'm sorry, that was a
total accident. I didn't...

26:27.000 --> 26:31.469
Take a breath, and when you're ready
to begin challenge five of 13,

26:31.520 --> 26:36.547
follow the unseasonably dressed
homeless person across the street.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.787
What's going on?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.704
I'm still working on the surprise.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.191
I'm gonna be gone for
a couple of hours.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.388
- Fuck you!
- I'm not joking, I gotta go.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.301
If I were a paranoid bridezilla, I'd
think you were getting cold feet.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.706
My feet are very warm.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.101
What if, just say, your
extremely strange behavior...

26:52.160 --> 26:53.719
you do agree, it's
extremely strange...

26:53.720 --> 26:54.901
Yes, definitely.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.631
Well, what if, hypothetically,
I decided I didn't find it

26:57.720 --> 27:00.221
as delightful as all that and
I seriously wanted to know

27:00.280 --> 27:02.030
- where you're running off to!
- I'd just have to hope

27:02.080 --> 27:04.467
it blew over by tonight.
I love you!

27:11.720 --> 27:13.822
You're doing great. I know
this is taking a little while,

27:13.880 --> 27:17.427
but we're almost done.
That should do the beard.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.504
Um, let's move on to the eyes.

27:20.560 --> 27:25.382
Do you think the eyes were
bigger or smaller than these?

27:25.440 --> 27:28.908
- What do you think?
- Katie? Katie?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.821
- Honey, the guy's eyes?
- That's him! That's the man!

27:34.080 --> 27:36.467
- Who?
- That's the man who said

27:36.520 --> 27:38.907
that I was gonna go
to the orphanage.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.791
It says "wanted."

27:41.840 --> 27:44.705
- What's this?
- This is just weird is what this is.

27:44.760 --> 27:48.945
Beautiful back there, claims that this
guy came up to him on the street

27:49.000 --> 27:52.900
and offered to trade him an ostrich
for his clothes and shopping cart.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.188
- Did he have an ostrich?
- He did.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.547
What would a homeless guy
want with an ostrich?

27:57.600 --> 28:01.182
He didn't want an ostrich, so the guy
sweetened the deal by a thousand bucks.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.463
- And he believed him.
- The guy's got an ostrich.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.782
He might have a thousand bucks.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.030
- What do you got?
- Ostrich Boy again.

28:15.080 --> 28:19.105
This is from the identikit of the church
arson that happened earlier today.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.991
There's security footage, too.
I just put Richardson and Dobbs on it.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.585
- I'll go myself.
- They just left.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.705
- Call them back. I'll go myself.
- OK.

28:53.200 --> 28:58.261
Challenge six for $50,000 is
a good deed, for a change.

28:58.320 --> 29:02.584
Upstairs in 6-B lives
Mr. Shaw, a lonely man.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.346
- Take him for a cup of coffee.
- And?

29:05.400 --> 29:09.824
And there's a diner called Taylor's
two blocks from where you are.

29:09.880 --> 29:14.588
Have him there with a cup of
coffee in front of him by 4:00.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.304
Mr. Shaw?

29:35.840 --> 29:37.863
Mr. Shaw?

29:49.760 --> 29:51.828
Mr. Shaw?

30:18.160 --> 30:22.151
Oh, my god.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.506
Oh, my God.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.871
Oh!

30:28.920 --> 30:31.068
That man is dead.

30:31.120 --> 30:35.350
That man is really dead.
You kill him?

30:35.400 --> 30:39.107
Mr. Brindle, this man
took his own life.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.901
You see there in that tub what
the meek actually inherit.

30:42.960 --> 30:46.269
No. No, I can't.
I'm not doing that.

30:46.360 --> 30:51.307
This is not swatting flies anymore.
It's a crime. It's desecration.

30:51.360 --> 30:57.103
Dragging a corpse through the streets.
Are you insane? Who are you?

30:57.160 --> 31:01.026
Two paths lie before you.
One requires a bit of courage

31:01.080 --> 31:03.501
and leads to enough money
to settle your debts,

31:03.560 --> 31:05.947
keep Michael safe, and
provide your child

31:06.000 --> 31:09.547
everything from a pony
to a college education.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.748
The other leads to
loveless poverty.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.302
All that requires is you
just continue being you.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.462
- You don't know me.
- Well...

31:17.560 --> 31:20.391
No, you don't know me. You
don't know anything about me!

31:20.480 --> 31:23.823
Maybe you've done research, maybe you
know facts, but you do not know me!

31:23.880 --> 31:29.384
You have until 4:00. Mr. Shaw
takes his coffee black.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.863
- Hi there. How we all doing today?
- Great.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.546
- My name is Jeanette...
- He's just gonna have a cup of coffee.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.664
- Black, please.
- OK.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.186
- And for you?
- Nothing for me.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.679
If you're sitting at the booth,
you have to order something.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.111
Well, I'm gonna be going, so...

32:57.560 --> 32:59.981
- I'll have a cheeseburger.
- The Bernars burger?

33:00.080 --> 33:01.670
Yeah, that sounds great.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.911
OK. And you get sides with that.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.348
Your choices are baked
potato, baked beans...

33:18.400 --> 33:20.821
- Baked beans. The baked beans.
- OK.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.631
My name is Jeanette, and I
will be taking care of you.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.942
Great. Can you just take care of me?
You don't have to explain

33:26.000 --> 33:28.900
any of the procedure or anything.
He just really needs a cup of coffee.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.863
Thank you.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.143
she puts in for a transfer,
he takes early retirement.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.462
Scoot.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.749
- We ain't gonna fit in this booth...
- That's true.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.908
I think so. There you go.
Come on, get it...

33:52.960 --> 33:54.983
Wide load.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.824
- I remember.
- Right.

33:56.880 --> 34:01.030
- OK. Three regular and one decaf.
- Yeah.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.831
Good and hot, fresh pot.

34:04.440 --> 34:08.784
- Sugar.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.820
The hair of the dog.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.661
- Hey, hey!
- You got a problem here, sir?

34:18.719 --> 34:21.744
No. Not at all. I, uh...

34:21.800 --> 34:25.585
- I was waiting before you. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

34:27.679 --> 34:29.110
I, uh...

34:32.840 --> 34:35.944
Why don't we step outside real
quick and have a word about this?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.420
- Is that a flask?
- What?

34:38.480 --> 34:42.824
- Is that a flask on the table?
- I'm gonna need you to step outside.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.105
You know that's not
just a code infraction.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.230
In uniform, it's a 306.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.702
My guess is you've never been
to a diversion program before.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.660
Make you open up to a shrink like three
days a week, and there's group sessions.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.188
They show films about empowerment.
There's reading materials, too.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.144
You want your coffee? Please.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.666
No? OK.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.742
Drink your coffee, buddy.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.102
Did you see how it
went down back there?

35:23.160 --> 35:26.662
Kudos! We were so impressed
by the way you avoided arrest

35:26.720 --> 35:30.108
during challenge six, we've
decided, what the hell,

35:30.160 --> 35:32.945
to count that as challenge
seven completed as well.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.944
- Thank you so much!
- You'll be less pleased to hear

35:36.000 --> 35:39.547
your brother's doctor's office just
received an anonymous phone call

35:39.600 --> 35:44.388
alerting them to the fact that Michael
would soon no longer be insured.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.908
- What?
- His file's already marked for review.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.826
But none of this matters,
of course, if you win.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.943
- Who was that?
- He said he was a reporter.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.024
What was he asking you?

37:26.080 --> 37:29.901
If you guys had said anything about
other things the guy might have done,

37:29.960 --> 37:33.143
the destruction of a sacred place.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.666
He gave you something?

37:55.280 --> 37:57.587
- Yes.
- Before the next challenge,

37:57.640 --> 38:01.381
please take out your New
Orleans Parish Library card.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.941
My library card?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.828
- I don't have it.
- No, you don't.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.870
You dropped it back at Taylor's
Diner, where it's been found.

38:12.920 --> 38:17.070
It won't be long till they trace the
number to you, if they haven't already.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.587
You're facing at least
ten years in prison

38:19.640 --> 38:23.506
for arson, assault, and
desecration of a corpse.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.901
But here's the good news.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.950
If you successfully
complete all 13 challenges,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.671
we will make all these
charges go away.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.822
It's what we do for winners.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.870
Losers, however, are on their own.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.621
Try to think of this in the
most positive, empowering way

38:40.680 --> 38:43.067
as a gun pointed to your head.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.270
Mr. Vogler?

38:58.280 --> 39:00.667
Mr. Vogler!

39:07.560 --> 39:09.503
Mr. Vogler!

39:10.960 --> 39:12.949
I'm with the police.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.784
I'm not here to arrest you.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.461
You were at the diner today.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.942
You seem to know something
about a man I'm looking for.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.627
- I can't trust you.
- You saw my badge.

39:27.680 --> 39:32.263
That doesn't mean anything! They got
cops working for them, I'm sure!

39:32.320 --> 39:34.468
They?

39:34.520 --> 39:38.705
All right. I'll tell you this, in
case you are who you say you are.

39:38.760 --> 39:43.104
If you get this guy in your
sights, do not hesitate,

39:43.160 --> 39:45.661
blow his brains out.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.545
Hello.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.510
Hi.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.790
Um...

41:50.000 --> 41:55.231
I'm sitting here counting to ten
over and over again on my fingers.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.065
You get used to things, you know?

42:00.040 --> 42:01.869
OK.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.580
- Gum?
- No, thanks.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.466
You know, um...

42:48.840 --> 42:51.341
you kinda had this thing
in your head and...

42:51.400 --> 42:54.470
but then it actually gets to you.

42:54.520 --> 42:55.985
You know?

42:56.040 --> 42:58.268
Is this your fantasy?

42:59.800 --> 43:02.585
Have you ever done
one of these before?

43:02.680 --> 43:04.942
Done what?

43:08.640 --> 43:11.425
You didn't go to Holmes, did you?

43:11.520 --> 43:14.942
Holmes Middle School? Yeah, I did.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.023
Did you have Metal
Shop with Fishman?

43:17.080 --> 43:18.466
Uh-huh.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.704
- I'm Elliot Brindle.
- That's right.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.386
I'm John Witter.

43:37.320 --> 43:42.108
I was in real estate
for a long time.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.422
Made good money.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.104
But I had some reversals.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.591
What's going on here?

43:56.480 --> 44:00.710
We've gone to a great deal of
effort to arrange this reunion.

44:00.760 --> 44:04.626
You don't remember Johnny Witter
from Mr. Fishman's class?

44:04.680 --> 44:08.262
How he and his brother
Tom tormented you daily?

44:08.320 --> 44:12.141
How they held you by the ankles
out the computer lab window?

44:12.200 --> 44:15.747
Challenge eight is worth $100,000.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.141
Amputate his right arm
just below the elbow.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.348
- No. No way.
- It's your right to decline, of course.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.743
But if you don't complete
all 13 challenges,

44:28.800 --> 44:33.986
you will forfeit the grand prize,
as well as everything you've won.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.551
You should know that Mr. Witter

44:35.600 --> 44:39.147
has quite gladly consented
to this procedure.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.665
Ask him.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.830
You want your arm cut off?

44:47.200 --> 44:48.506
Yes.

44:50.440 --> 44:53.271
- Yes?
- Just get on with it.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.310
They're paying you.

45:11.200 --> 45:15.624
- He's still awake.
- I've given him a local anesthetic.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.668
You have no right to
back out of this.

45:20.160 --> 45:23.150
I knew you were gonna
pussy out! I knew it!

45:23.240 --> 45:25.707
- Look, I know you are trying to...
- You're gonna give me fucking sympathy?

45:25.760 --> 45:30.070
Are you for real?
You're fucking sickening.

45:30.160 --> 45:34.470
You know why we always picked on you?
'Cause you fucking asked for it!

45:34.520 --> 45:38.466
You walked around with that stupid
look on your fucking face saying,

45:38.520 --> 45:41.100
"Please punch me in
my fucking throat."

45:41.160 --> 45:43.228
The day after we threw
you in the dumpster,

45:43.280 --> 45:45.826
you passed me in the quad
and you smiled at me.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.308
You fucking smiled at me!

45:48.360 --> 45:52.510
My brother pissed on
your brother's face.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.307
You remember that? You can't
tell me you don't remember that.

45:56.920 --> 45:59.751
I do. I bust a gut every
time I think about it.

45:59.800 --> 46:05.748
Now do it! Go on, do it!

46:07.720 --> 46:08.821
Come on.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.144
Come on, come on, come on!

46:57.600 --> 46:59.225
Where's your car?

47:02.040 --> 47:06.509
Did you call my brother?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.865
Did you tell him who you were?

47:11.160 --> 47:13.991
This doesn't change anything.
You're still a loser.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.346
You'll always be a loser.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.822
Yeah, well, you've obviously
done very well for yourselves.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.150
Got yourselves a nice
leather jacket, fancy car.

47:25.160 --> 47:28.867
It's going to be a little difficult
for you to put it in gear, though.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.790
Guess you didn't really
think that one through.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.949
Thank you.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.871
- We're going to need a report.
- Of course.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.347
Sir. Sir?

47:44.400 --> 47:47.788
Dr. Anderson to Maternity,
please. Dr. Anderson...

47:47.880 --> 47:50.631
I don't care about
your goddamn system!

47:51.200 --> 47:53.951
It's Witter. W-I-T-T-E-R.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.989
I know you have my brother
back there somewhere.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.519
- Just a moment.
- Get off your fat fucking ass,

47:58.520 --> 48:00.799
- and go find out where he is!
- Hey. I'll tell you what

48:00.800 --> 48:03.028
happened to your brother.
Just grab a chair.

48:03.080 --> 48:07.310
- What the fuck!
- Security!

48:07.840 --> 48:10.227
Oh, oh!

48:13.880 --> 48:15.709
Security!

48:19.760 --> 48:22.431
Elliot Brindle.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.269
You were a challenge.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.109
You were a challenge.

48:55.720 --> 49:00.747
I can't believe Sergio gave us the grand
ballroom. He says we get it all night!

49:00.800 --> 49:04.222
- Elliot's a miracle worker.
- Uh-oh! Speak of the devil!

49:04.280 --> 49:07.748
Oh! Well, well, well.

49:08.880 --> 49:11.950
- My man of mystery.
- Mmm...

49:18.600 --> 49:23.661
- Hm... You look rather snazzy.
- Mmm. So do you.

49:23.720 --> 49:24.901
Where did you get this?

49:27.200 --> 49:31.988
- Aunt Jessica. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.790
Have you told her the story
of your Alaskan cruise?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.704
- You gotta hear it, it's amazing.
- What?

49:39.640 --> 49:41.344
Have a good night.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.744
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.823
- Looking good.
- You don't have to do that.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.749
I can do that myself. OK?

49:48.800 --> 49:51.904
- Well, you look good.
- Thank you.

50:01.160 --> 50:03.024
That one's clean.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.705
What about this dresser?

50:04.760 --> 50:06.624
Check underneath.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.623
Could be a false bottom there.

50:08.680 --> 50:09.861
Got something, boss.

50:09.920 --> 50:12.751
Looks like they're attending
their wedding rehearsal dinner

50:12.800 --> 50:14.709
at the country club.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.702
- Boss?
- Let's go.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.020
Congratulations.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.266
Challenge ten of 13 is a worth
a half million dollars.

50:45.320 --> 50:49.425
All you have to do is wait until
you're called upon to give a toast

50:49.520 --> 50:54.501
and then destroy the wedding hall,
while singing "The Internationale."

50:54.560 --> 50:56.822
- What?
- We're quantifying destruction

50:56.880 --> 51:00.905
in the following manner: At
least 75 percent of all ceramic

51:00.960 --> 51:04.382
or crystal objects in the
hall must be shattered.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.907
- Bastard!
- At least one of the wonderful

51:07.000 --> 51:10.070
floral centerpieces
must be urinated upon.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.224
If you're not familiar with the
Internationale Communist Anthem,

51:13.280 --> 51:16.589
you will find the lyrics in
your left jacket pocket.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.105
You know I was doing this for her.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.831
And it is for her you
must soldier on!

51:20.880 --> 51:24.348
You've committed six felonies.
Any future with Shelby,

51:24.400 --> 51:28.141
indeed, any future not organized
around routine sodomy,

51:28.200 --> 51:32.430
now depends on you completing
all 13 challenges.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.789
I first met Elliot two years ago

51:36.840 --> 51:40.069
and I knew right away all I
needed to know about him...

51:40.120 --> 51:42.666
that he made my daughter happy.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.551
I already feel you're like a son.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.747
- Son?
- Baby.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.866
Speech! Speech! Speech!

52:04.360 --> 52:06.030
Come on!

52:10.680 --> 52:13.989
Shelby, there's a life
that you deserve,

52:14.040 --> 52:18.304
and I swear to you I'll do
anything to make that real.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.150
Sir?

52:23.600 --> 52:26.943
That gentleman over there, we're
gonna need to speak with him.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.183
Got a few questions we need
to ask him. I'm sorry...

52:30.840 --> 52:32.624
- All right. Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.544
We'll be waiting.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.342
Son?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.580
Park security, they want Michael.

52:43.680 --> 52:47.182
They say he exposed himself
to a girl at the tennis court.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.705
I told them you'll talk to them.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.941
- Um, everyone...
- Michael?

52:52.000 --> 52:54.671
let's have our drinks outside
while we wait for our food.

52:54.720 --> 52:58.666
Shall we? Thank you.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.584
Let's just get the
folks outta here.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.788
- What happened?
- I didn't touch her or anything.

53:02.840 --> 53:05.102
I just wanted to show her it.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.871
- OK? I just wanted to show it to her.
- It's OK.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.624
They'll make me pee in a cup.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.624
I haven't had my pill in
three days. In three days.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.989
- It'll be OK.
- No. Horowitz will institutionalize him

53:16.040 --> 53:17.346
if he can't trust him
to take his meds.

53:17.400 --> 53:22.427
They'll make me go back to Bayview.
I don't want to go back to Bayview, OK?

53:22.480 --> 53:24.628
They make me pee in a cup.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.463
Michael, get ready to run.
I have an idea.

53:29.560 --> 53:34.109
- Ready to run...
- Arise, ye workers, from your slumbers!

53:34.160 --> 53:38.265
- Go home and take your pill.
- Sir, that's enough. Sir?

53:38.360 --> 53:40.986
- Elliot!
- I'm buying him time.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.461
What are you doing?!

54:22.000 --> 54:24.626
Stay back! We don't want
anyone getting hurt!

54:24.680 --> 54:26.941
- Put it down. Let's talk about it.
- Stay right there.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.790
Look away.

54:32.840 --> 54:35.750
I said look away...
look away right now!

54:37.440 --> 54:39.224
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.424
- Easy.
- This one's goin' nowhere.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.826
- Easy.
- This boy is mine.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.266
Easy!

55:00.320 --> 55:03.071
- Stop right there!
- Stop, you son of a bitch!

55:09.760 --> 55:11.783
What the hell are you doing?
Open the door.

55:13.880 --> 55:18.269
Mr. Brindle, you did complete
this last challenge,

55:18.320 --> 55:22.311
but we've observed you're still far too
concerned with what people think of you.

55:22.360 --> 55:26.704
You're still holding back, still
clinging to an old image of yourself.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.823
- But I did it.
- So you did.

55:28.880 --> 55:31.347
And now challenge 11 of 13

55:31.400 --> 55:35.391
is to open that door and surrender
to the security guards.

55:35.440 --> 55:38.430
- What?
- So says the golden toad.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.942
A brave arm makes a
short sword long.

55:43.400 --> 55:44.547
What am I supposed to do?

55:44.600 --> 55:47.510
Is this a punishment or are
we still playing the game?

56:00.200 --> 56:02.780
Guys, hold up. He's comin' around.

56:02.880 --> 56:06.063
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.710
Cocksucker!

56:19.320 --> 56:23.869
So... things just got to you?

56:27.240 --> 56:29.547
Oh, I understand how it is.

56:29.600 --> 56:34.547
Things build up, all the shit a
person goes through during the day.

56:34.600 --> 56:37.590
All the petty little humiliations.

56:37.640 --> 56:39.868
I have no complaints.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.742
Is it political? Do you have
feelings about the government?

56:47.880 --> 56:50.870
Did someone order you
to do these things?

56:50.920 --> 56:52.909
I didn't say that.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.861
Tell me about the voice.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.064
What?

57:06.680 --> 57:08.544
I didn't say anything
about the voice.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.704
Did it just start telling
you to do things today?

57:12.640 --> 57:13.821
How did you know about the voice?

57:13.880 --> 57:17.701
I want it on record I didn't
say anything about the voice.

57:17.760 --> 57:20.511
It's probably been there for years.

57:20.560 --> 57:25.188
A little whisper, and then
today it became a roar.

57:26.280 --> 57:30.101
- You think I'm crazy.
- Is it a pure coincidence

57:30.160 --> 57:32.501
that the voices directing
you told you to do

57:32.560 --> 57:37.541
all the dark, secret little
things you wanted to do anyway?

57:37.640 --> 57:39.708
What satisfaction did you get

57:39.760 --> 57:42.021
from pushing that old woman
down that flight of stairs?

57:44.960 --> 57:46.141
- I didn't do that.
- No?

57:46.200 --> 57:48.587
And I guess you didn't burn
down the Hindu shrine, either!

57:48.640 --> 57:51.789
No, I didn't do this.
I didn't do any of these.

57:51.840 --> 57:54.989
So somebody else was having a bad
day, too? There's two of you out there?

58:01.520 --> 58:03.827
I... I...

58:04.960 --> 58:07.427
I need to get out of here.
I want a lawyer.

58:07.480 --> 58:09.548
Good answer.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.863
Hm...

58:21.920 --> 58:25.342
- I was just there.
- Yeah?

58:28.840 --> 58:33.468
Captain, I'd love it if I could
have a moment with him alone.

58:33.520 --> 58:37.022
- Is that so?
- That is so.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.981
Hey, hey!

59:27.080 --> 59:28.639
Mr. Brindle, you don't
want to do this.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.424
I'm sorry, but I do.
I need my cell phone.

59:30.480 --> 59:33.504
- Put the gun down.
- Easy, Officer. Easy.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.860
Don't do nothing stupid here.

59:37.920 --> 59:41.308
- Easy.
- Thank you.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.741
I need a second, please.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.829
Hold fire.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.664
Watch him, watch him.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.864
- Send 'em around the other side.
- He has a hostage!

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.102
- Cuff yourself.
- Mr. Brindle.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.463
Uh... cover your ears and hum
"The Star Spangled Banner."

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.226
Talk to us!

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.468
So there's another player? Is
somebody else playing the game?

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.622
There is one other player, yes.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.465
That's a little wrinkle we were
going to spring on you later.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.341
- You can't just change the rules!
- You knew there were time limits.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.191
Your ultimate time limit
is the other player.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.947
If he completes challenge 13
before you, he gets the prize

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.105
and you get 20 years for the remarkable
stunt you're pulling right now.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.342
- Keep humming!
- Mr. Brindle, talk to us.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.750
You should know your opponent is on
challenge 11, too. Right there with you.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.902
What? I'm on 12 right now!

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.110
This is not a challenge. This
does not count as challenge 12.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.984
But you rigged the
thing on the chair!

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.064
We assure you we had
nothing to do with that.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.989
You're doing this on your own.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.830
You don't have a lot
of time, Brindle.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.426
OK, I'm doing this on my own.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.629
I've been on my own all day.
I've been on my own my whole life!

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.066
- Mr. Brindle.
- The other guy,

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.110
he bust out of a police
station, too? No, he didn't.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.786
He did not. But I'm gonna do it.
No matter what you throw at me,

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.544
I chew it up and I
spit it the fuck out!

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.789
Shit!

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.990
- It's just his foot!
- Go, go!

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.187
- Move, move!
- Get it open!

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.702
- I've got a clear shot!
- I said stand down!

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.861
Back alley!

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.705
- Go. Go get him.
- Go, go, go!

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.305
Brindle...

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.145
you gonna make me say "freeze"?

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.110
What are you doing?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.821
You think this is a game?

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.863
You get shot, that's gonna
end the fun pretty quick.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.119
Freeze!

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.263
No, I don't know.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.344
Yeah, there's something going
on like right down the street.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.780
No, I'm gonna check it out.
It's like... Hey!

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.910
- Are you there? Are you watching?
- What the fuck?

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.506
- Why don't you give me my phone!
- Just walk away, man.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.390
Walk away.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.304
I know you're watching!

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.709
I got a phone! You can
call me on this phone!

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.351
I know you didn't just happen by.
They sent you, didn't they?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.300
I know you're my next challenge!
Tell me, what am I supposed to do?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.623
Oh, you just wanna go home.
OK, where's your home?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.744
OK, come on, come on!

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.906
If you don't want to be found, you
can't just switch off your phone.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.461
You gotta take the battery out.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.224
Give us a minute.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.029
So if I were a part
of this conspiracy,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.587
why would I be even
asking you questions?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.584
Even if you worked for them, they'd
probably keep you in the dark.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.710
You probably know a
tenth of what I know.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.187
Fair enough, but, um...

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.468
in that scenario,
you're dead already.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.745
So, why not talk?

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.229
But if, on the other hand,

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.704
there is a, uh, a one in a hundred
chance that I'm a real cop

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.749
and you're holding back information

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.507
while there's a maniac
out there running wild,

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.870
well, that would make you
an accessory to, uh...

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.070
I don't know. Shall we start
tallying the charges?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.587
I came home from work one day, and
found that my wife had left me...

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.744
and killed our dog.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.141
And partially eaten him.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.501
Now, you'll just have
to take my word for it,

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.583
that was completely
out of character.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.906
You see, that's the true
objective of the game,

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.348
the spectacle of transformation.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.744
To show that anyone can
be turned into a monster.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.909
You don't know anything
about the game, do you?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.904
You're just an old
woman, aren't you?

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.624
It's over. I'm so sorry.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.423
You need help? You
want me to hang that?

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.665
OK.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.941
That's it?

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.706
No.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.306
Fuck.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.828
Stop!

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.310
Stop!

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.545
Wait! Stop!

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.825
Whoo!

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.303
That was the easiest hundred bucks ever.
Anything else we can do for you?

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.464
No...

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:08.107
Wait! Stop! Stop!

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.341
Wait! Stop! Stop!

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.702
Stop! Stop!

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.665
Don't!

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.505
We're back! And we have a
very special announcement!

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.508
Elliot Brindle, as of four minutes
ago, you are a millionaire!

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.429
Congratulations.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.341
We've now reached a point in the game
where we like to give our audience

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.989
the opportunity to ask our contestants
a few questions. Are you ready?

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.301
Saint Inna 57 says
he's very impressed

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.942
with how you have grown in
these last several hours...

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.541
I'm not playing anymore!

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.144
It was a game just for
someone's amusement, right?

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.828
Whose? I don't know.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.468
But sometimes...

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.106
Sometimes I think about how
few people on this planet

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.989
really decide everything.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.189
One percent of one percent.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.824
They are the functional
equivalent of gods.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.665
They must get... bored.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.944
How does it end? This game?

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.741
Thirteen is the end.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.028
Thirteen never changes.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.148
Some contestants think they can
walk away, but it's a snuff shell.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.031
There's only one way those end.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.068
Please be advised to expect delays
for the 342 train to New Orleans...

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.305
- Excuse me.
- Get your hands off me.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.189
Did you hear that?
Do you have a phone?

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.183
Watch it.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.749
- Who has a phone?
- Cell phone?

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.830
Shit. You crazy?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.425
Hey!

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.264
What's your hurry, buddy?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.062
You don't have to do this.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.060
They're killing people.
Listen to me. I quit.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.582
You could quit, too.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.581
What are you?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.107
You know, thwarting your
opponent's progress

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.025
could be interpreted as
interfering with the game.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.387
Yeah? What's he gonna do, huh?

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.622
What's he gonna do that's gonna top
what happened back on that road?

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.919
Is he going to crash a plane?
Blow up a fucking school?

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.069
Thirteen is a bit more
intimate than that.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.666
And it's the same for all
players, including you.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.345
I told you I'm not playing anymore.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.868
The final challenge is
worth four point...

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.864
Dad. Dad! You OK?

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.627
What happened to you?

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.545
I had an eventful day.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.863
You look like you're
about to shit yourself.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.545
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.700
You're here?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.501
You're here, too.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.150
My stomach's upset. I think I
ate something that was bad.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.030
- How are you doing?
- Michael, what are you doing here?

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.224
I thought you said you were gonna
go home and take your pill.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.270
Yeah, well, I had to do some stuff.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.267
- What stuff?
- Well, I was with Marisol.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.390
- Marisol from the Hot Dog Castle?
- Yeah.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.464
What's it mean you were
"with" her? Like a date?

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.985
Yeah, like a date.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.544
Like people go on to the
movies, OK? We... OK?

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.863
- What movie did you see?
- I don't remember.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.020
- You don't remember?
- It's not like science fiction, Elliot,

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.429
that I could go on a date
with somebody, ever. OK?

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.548
What's in the bag, Michael?

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.027
Michael, what's challenge 13?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.947
You gotta tell me.
What's challenge 13?

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.991
You have to... to
kill a family member.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.068
That's what they said,
to kill a family member.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.347
- Go home, Michael.
- Why? Why? So you can win?

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.668
No, no, I wanna win. I wanna
win something one time!

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.790
I wanna win one t...

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.630
Michael, I know you've been able
to do everything they've asked you

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.465
'cause you don't think about stuff.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.384
But you're thinking now, right?

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.349
Remember when Dad used
a studded belt on me?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.309
Yeah. I remember other things, too.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.383
I remember how he used to dote
on you when you were little.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.747
No, I don't remember
when I was little!

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.746
I remember when I was eight and
he hit me with a tennis racket.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.221
So you're gonna shoot him?

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.624
Michael. Michael, he hit me, too.
Remember when I scratched the car?

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:29.423
It warms my heart a little to see the
two of you showing some initiative.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.949
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.991
The game's not what it was in
my day, I'll tell you that.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.267
Drafting idiots like you.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.151
They turned it into a freak show.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.429
- Jesus.
- You played the game?

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.461
- I won.
- You did all 13?

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.385
Thirteen is the tough one.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.020
- Bit of a leap there.
- Who did you kill?

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.346
She was the only softness in me.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.226
- Jesus!
- What is he saying, Elliot?

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.742
I'm saying your mother
never wore a seat belt.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.868
Michael, wait in the other room.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.547
- Elliot?
- Just wait in the other room.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.630
For real?

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.904
OK.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.866
That game ruined me.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.109
I had everything before
and nothing after.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.661
It poisoned me.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.625
Every cell from that day to this.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.390
But the thing is,

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.989
I know that even if I'd had somebody
telling me all these things then,

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.905
it wouldn't have mattered because
I wouldn't have listened

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.586
any more than you're listening now.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.102
But there is one thing
I can do for you.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.505
Yeah?

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.185
- I can keep you from winning.
- How are you gonna do that?

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.981
Oh... oh... oh...

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.869
OK...

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.464
Well... what do we do now?

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.104
I... I did some things.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.747
Yeah, me, too.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:41.026
How do I know that you
won't do something to me?

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.944
Why would I do something to you?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.628
You're my family member,
I'm yours. So...

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.582
One of us could still
win, if we wanted to.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.188
Do you want to?

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.507
No.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.344
Let's go.

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.061
- What are you doing?
- Just getting my bag.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.748
- Mikey, just leave it.
- I have to get my pills.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.141
- Why are you doing that?
- Just have to get them.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.541
Just zip it up. Just...

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:34.023
Mike! Jesus Christ!

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.227
You're gonna be OK.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.742
Press really hard right there.
Press right here.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.782
They said I could buy you a wedding
present if I had the money.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.385
If I had the money I could...

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.950
I just want to win.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.828
One time I want to win.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.630
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.585
- It's OK.
- I'm so sorry!

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.509
- Come here.
- Ah!

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.229
Stop!

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.026
- I want to win.
- Ah!

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.701
Stop!

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.582
I'm sorry.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.028
Yeah, the evidence trail
is taken care of.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.945
My colleagues have nothing.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.626
Nah, it's pretty much
Hamlet in here.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.510
This is a violation of the
terms of the agreement.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.109
You are forbidden to interfere with
or seek out the origins of the game.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.069
That was explained to you.

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.827
Everything's been fixed.
No one is after you.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.744
Now, if you'll just back away,

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.949
you can still go home a winner.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.030
They'll take the money away.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.621
I'm just an employee. I'm nothing.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:37.821
You're here.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.060
Elliot! My God! Where are you?
Did they release you?

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.109
Daddy said they were still
waiting to hear about bail,

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.349
but when I went to the station, they
didn't have any record of your arrest.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.661
What's going on?

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.391
I'm on my way home right now.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.941
Everything's been
straightened out. I just...

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.430
I wanted to hear your voice.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.107
My God. That's all I
can think to say.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.386
Yeah.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.224
As if things weren't insane
enough, somebody called

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.748
and offered me $6,000 to eat a fly.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.666
What did you say?

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.182
What did I say?

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.584
Are you kidding?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.625
I said fuck off! That's vile.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.551
I mean, could you imagine?

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.623
Anyway, I better get a move on.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.431
Oh, and of course there's already another
detour we're gonna have to make.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.060
We have to stop at my Uncle
Louie's and pick up his camera

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.747
because my father, who's so proud of
his photography, dropped his camera.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.187
Don't make fun. You
know how he gets...
