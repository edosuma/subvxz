WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:02.777
I have a theory.

00:02.844 --> 00:05.002
Everybody has a weird thing about them

00:05.003 --> 00:06.413
that they keep on the D.L.

00:06.413 --> 00:09.072
For example, every morning,
my ex-wife Ashley

00:09.073 --> 00:10.641
has to sing her shower routine.

00:16.548 --> 00:19.716
Singing jazz while you wash your ass.

00:19.817 --> 00:23.053
Yvette refuses to be seen
without a full face of makeup,

00:23.154 --> 00:25.455
which is why we're dropping
by at 3:00 in the morning.

00:25.523 --> 00:27.991
Ha-ha.

00:28.092 --> 00:30.193
You tried it.

00:30.295 --> 00:33.163
And then there's Stevie,
who tends to blur the lines

00:33.264 --> 00:34.164
of relationships.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.466
No, I miss you more.

00:36.534 --> 00:38.769
No, you hang up.

00:38.836 --> 00:42.506
Okay. Love you, Nana.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.609
That boy ain't right.

00:53.284 --> 00:56.353
<font color="#FFDF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by</font>
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:58.456 --> 01:00.524
Then he sends me a text saying

01:00.625 --> 01:02.659
that we need to slow things down

01:02.727 --> 01:06.663
after I done dropped a grip
on a damn kayak.

01:06.764 --> 01:08.765
Talking 'bout, "We gon' hit the lake."

01:08.833 --> 01:10.400
He a lie!

01:11.369 --> 01:12.736
Kayak?

01:12.837 --> 01:15.472
I thought we were talking about
CrossFit guy.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.642
CrossFit guy is why I bought
that giant tire.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.511
Talking 'bout,
"We gon' strengthen my core."

01:21.613 --> 01:24.381
He a lie, too!

01:24.482 --> 01:28.652
I'm telling you...
"LeRoy" pronounced "LaRoix."

01:28.720 --> 01:30.754
Jeez, Marlon, obvious much?

01:30.855 --> 01:33.090
Next you're gonna claim
it's "Tyrone" or "Malik."

01:33.191 --> 01:35.692
Okay, what are you two arguing about?

01:35.793 --> 01:38.862
Blackest name ever.

01:38.930 --> 01:42.199
Tackling the big issues, I see?

01:42.266 --> 01:44.835
I am three credits shy
of a bachelor's degree

01:44.902 --> 01:47.704
in African-American studies,
so I can assure you,

01:47.772 --> 01:51.375
the blackest name ever must
reflect our African heritage.

01:51.476 --> 01:55.712
Jarobi, Ademisope, Tahir.

01:55.780 --> 01:58.081
No, no, no, you are wrong.

01:58.182 --> 01:59.475
First of all, ain't no black person

01:59.476 --> 02:01.852
gon' name they baby Tahir.

02:01.919 --> 02:05.589
That's way too much spit in it.
"Tahir."

02:05.690 --> 02:08.558
They gotta be something made up,
like-like JaMarion.

02:08.626 --> 02:10.526
You know, the daddy's name is James,

02:10.595 --> 02:13.563
the mama's name is Marion,
but it's spelled weird.

02:13.631 --> 02:18.268
You know, it's like "J," apostrophe...

02:18.369 --> 02:22.339
"M-A," capital "R" for no damn reason,

02:22.407 --> 02:25.609
"I," with a hyphenated "O-N,"

02:25.710 --> 02:28.645
and there's a weird,
silent "Q" as well.

02:31.749 --> 02:36.186
Ah! Another text from the kayaker.

02:36.254 --> 02:37.821
"Can we still hook up?"

02:37.922 --> 02:41.758
No, we cannot,
Quantavius Rasheed Jackson!

02:45.296 --> 02:46.797
Oh, yeah, that's it right there.

02:46.898 --> 02:48.565
Black, blackity, black-black.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.635
No, that's bliggity black
black black black black.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.304
Marlon, look at this.

02:54.405 --> 02:57.574
The storage facility we used
in 2004 is closing,

02:57.642 --> 02:59.776
and they say that we have
to empty out our unit

02:59.877 --> 03:01.478
or they're gonna auction it off.

03:01.579 --> 03:02.579
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:02.647 --> 03:04.481
I mean, that has to be a mistake

03:04.582 --> 03:06.293
because we got rid of that unit
when we got divorced.

03:06.317 --> 03:08.317
You told me you went
down there and cleaned it out.

03:08.352 --> 03:09.486
Did I?

03:12.423 --> 03:14.791
Oh, my God.

03:14.892 --> 03:16.626
You were supposed to get rid
of this stuff.

03:16.728 --> 03:19.162
Ashley, if I did everything
I was supposed to do,

03:19.263 --> 03:20.964
we'd still be married.

03:21.032 --> 03:24.801
Oh, would you look
at all this cool stuff?

03:24.902 --> 03:27.404
The milk frother
from our first apartment.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.406
I've been looking for this.

03:29.474 --> 03:31.174
You know I've been paying
for frothy milk

03:31.275 --> 03:33.710
all these years like a sucker?

03:36.714 --> 03:38.482
I remember this.

03:38.549 --> 03:41.318
We got this at Six Flags
the year after we met.

03:41.419 --> 03:43.620
Damn, girl, check you out
in them booty shorts.

03:43.688 --> 03:45.648
Hey, if I find them in here,
will you put them on?

03:45.690 --> 03:48.725
Only if you on those Hammer pants.

03:48.826 --> 03:50.560
- No, I'm good.
- Mm-hmm.

03:50.661 --> 03:52.562
- Hey, would you look at this?
- What?

03:52.630 --> 03:55.832
Our hand-carved,
ancient African CD rack,

03:55.933 --> 03:57.467
straight from the motherland.

03:57.535 --> 04:00.704
There were no CDs in ancient Africa.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.306
Oh, that's what the man
wants you to think.

04:03.374 --> 04:04.641
Stay woke, sister.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.843
Ooh.

04:06.944 --> 04:10.180
Oh, my gosh, there's so many
memories in here.

04:10.281 --> 04:12.349
Yeah, good times.

04:12.416 --> 04:14.484
This stuff takes me back.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.685
Let's toss it all.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:16.754 --> 04:19.656
Wow, you are cold.

04:19.724 --> 04:21.791
You are lucky I kept this.

04:21.858 --> 04:23.627
An electric blanket that's broken?

04:23.694 --> 04:25.495
Girl, it ain't broke.

04:25.563 --> 04:28.732
All I need is a big girl
up underneath here with me.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.000
She'll keep me warm.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.768
A big girl who likes rat droppings

04:31.869 --> 04:33.570
'cause they are all over that blanket.

04:33.671 --> 04:35.572
- Eww!
- Mm-hmm.

04:35.673 --> 04:37.374
Get rid of this stuff.

04:37.475 --> 04:39.486
Ashley, there may be
some hidden treasure in here.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.378
How 'bout this? I go through it,

04:41.445 --> 04:43.330
I look at what's valuable, I keep it,

04:43.331 --> 04:44.485
we get rid of the rest.

04:44.486 --> 04:45.882
Good. All right.

04:45.983 --> 04:48.919
I'm gonna go 'cause it smells
like 1997 up in here.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.021
Oh, damn.

04:51.088 --> 04:52.923
My Drakkar Noir must be leaking.

04:53.024 --> 04:54.558
Damn it!

05:01.332 --> 05:03.867
- What the hell?
- Hey, Stevie, check it out.

05:03.935 --> 05:08.471
My old Walkman,
complete with Mega Bass.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.748 --> 05:19.015
Ha-ha! Man, I can't wait

05:19.083 --> 05:21.952
to get the batteries for this thing.

05:22.053 --> 05:23.620
Marlon, what is all this?

05:23.721 --> 05:25.989
This is all the stuff
that was in the storage unit

05:26.090 --> 05:27.757
that Ashley wants me to get rid of.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.960
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna keep it.

05:30.061 --> 05:32.896
Is that a George Foreman grill?

05:32.964 --> 05:34.431
Yup.

05:34.498 --> 05:36.259
I got this when me and Ashley
used to live

05:36.260 --> 05:38.152
in this little apartment
in Studio City,

05:38.153 --> 05:39.636
and she got mad 'cause she wanted me

05:39.737 --> 05:43.607
to use the money
on boring stuff like rent.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.976
You crazy. Hey, look at this.

05:46.077 --> 05:47.811
She wanted me to get rid of this.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.814
This is a classic. Come on.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.985
Bam! "The Wiz" On LaserDisc!

05:55.086 --> 05:58.922
Come on, man, flying monkeys
with Rick Ross beard?

05:58.990 --> 06:02.759
You know, I am three credits
shy of a psychology degree,

06:02.827 --> 06:05.462
but I don't need that degree
to know that the inability

06:05.529 --> 06:08.231
to part with inanimate objects
is an illness.

06:08.299 --> 06:10.000
Stevie, are you calling me a hoarder?

06:10.101 --> 06:14.471
If the 8-ball jacket fits...
and it doesn't.

06:14.538 --> 06:15.978
No, no, no, no. I'm not a hoarder.

06:16.007 --> 06:18.842
See, hoarders collect things
that have no value.

06:18.943 --> 06:23.613
Come on, this 8-ball jacket
is going for $395 on eBay.

06:23.681 --> 06:25.348
That's exactly what hoarders say

06:25.449 --> 06:26.783
when they don't face the truth.

06:26.851 --> 06:28.852
Pick anything and ask yourself,

06:28.953 --> 06:30.487
"Does it serve a purpose?

06:30.554 --> 06:33.023
Does it bring me joy?
Does it better my life?"

06:33.124 --> 06:35.859
If the answer is no, get rid of it.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.828
Hmm, let me look around
and see if I can find something

06:38.930 --> 06:42.666
that serves no purpose,
brings me no joy,

06:42.733 --> 06:47.037
and does not better my life.

06:47.138 --> 06:48.838
Bye, Stevie.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.840
Clearly I've touched a nerve.

06:50.942 --> 06:52.976
But you can't seriously be
throwing me out.

06:53.044 --> 06:55.578
Listen, if you and Ashley
can't see the value

06:55.680 --> 06:58.515
in all this stuff, then you need
to sleep at her house.

07:08.044 --> 07:10.745
Our boy has a problem.

07:10.846 --> 07:14.449
You're just figuring this out now?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.951
He kicked me out of the house.

07:16.052 --> 07:17.986
Yeah, he's been doing that
four times a year

07:18.054 --> 07:19.587
since you moved in there.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.424
No, no, this is not
the quarterly toss-out.

07:25.328 --> 07:27.395
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

07:27.496 --> 07:28.964
This is the storage facility, right?

07:29.065 --> 07:31.733
That's Marlon's living room.

07:31.801 --> 07:36.404
Now, in my almost professional
opinion, Marlon's a hoarder.

07:36.505 --> 07:38.440
Yeah, all this stuff is junk.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.608
Is that his old 8-ball jacket?

07:40.710 --> 07:43.712
Okay, that's actually
pretty fly, though.

07:43.779 --> 07:46.414
But the rest of it is junk!

07:46.482 --> 07:49.517
This is a cry for help.
Okay, wait a minute.

07:49.585 --> 07:51.553
I found that jacket in the attic
six months ago,

07:51.620 --> 07:53.722
and I told him to take it to Goodwill.

07:53.789 --> 07:55.457
He knew that storage facility was there

07:55.558 --> 07:57.592
and he's been adding to it
since the divorce.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.395
We have to help him before
he's buried under a pile

08:00.463 --> 08:03.898
of "Vibe" magazines
and S-Curl products.

08:03.966 --> 08:06.534
Stevie, I think it's very sweet

08:06.602 --> 08:08.036
how much you care about him.

08:08.104 --> 08:11.740
Oh... the guy means everything to me.

08:11.807 --> 08:14.642
I also have nowhere to sleep.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.582
Ashley! Check it out!

08:22.418 --> 08:24.519
My old metal detector.

08:24.620 --> 08:27.155
I found $0.66, a bullet casing,

08:27.256 --> 08:30.592
and a car door on my way over here.

08:30.659 --> 08:33.561
Don't worry, I threw out
the bullet casing.

08:33.629 --> 08:35.063
I didn't want to be an accessory.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.700
Now, why are you all standing there

08:38.801 --> 08:41.135
solemnly holding envelopes
like Maury about to say,

08:41.203 --> 08:44.672
"Hey, Marlon, you are the father"?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.142
Marlon, welcome to your intervention.

08:47.243 --> 08:49.744
An intervention? For what?

08:49.812 --> 08:51.479
We'll get to that.

08:51.547 --> 08:53.715
Now, as a qualified
intervention specialist,

08:53.816 --> 08:54.983
I invite you to sit down.

08:55.051 --> 08:56.651
What makes you qualified?

08:56.719 --> 08:59.320
I've seen every episode
of "Intervention," "Hoarders,"

08:59.422 --> 09:01.856
and "Real Housewives Reunion."

09:01.957 --> 09:03.792
All you need is a loveless marriage

09:03.859 --> 09:08.563
and a blanket on your lap and
you'd be a middle-aged woman.

09:08.664 --> 09:12.033
We will start with "I love you
and care for your well-being."

09:12.134 --> 09:14.035
Now, we've each
written letters addressing

09:14.136 --> 09:16.504
how your illness has affected
our lives.

09:16.605 --> 09:18.640
We are gonna go
in reverse order of importance.

09:18.707 --> 09:21.976
Yvette.

09:22.044 --> 09:26.815
Marlon, I care for your
well-being, blah, blah, blah.

09:26.882 --> 09:30.018
Now let's get to the tea.

09:30.119 --> 09:33.655
You're nasty.

09:33.722 --> 09:35.757
You don't consider women's feelings,

09:35.858 --> 09:38.226
and what you do in the dark
will show up in the light...

09:38.327 --> 09:42.497
Yvette, let's stay focused
on the issue here.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.500
- Marlon's hoarding.
- Hoarding?

09:45.568 --> 09:47.669
I thought you said "whoring."

09:52.208 --> 09:54.576
Now nothing I wrote makes sense.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.011
Uh, you stuff your junk
anywhere you want to.

09:57.079 --> 09:58.780
Oh, some of this still works.

10:01.817 --> 10:04.719
Marlon, your collection
of useless objects has displaced

10:04.787 --> 10:08.123
the most valuable thing
in your house: my friendship.

10:08.224 --> 10:09.858
If your behavior doesn't change,

10:09.925 --> 10:12.494
I'll be forced to end our relationship.

10:12.561 --> 10:14.429
Oh, my God.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.632
If you do that, then who's
gonna eat up all my food?

10:19.101 --> 10:20.912
Who's gonna wear my clothes
and make them smell

10:20.936 --> 10:24.105
like gyro meat in the underarm section?

10:24.206 --> 10:27.108
And who's gonna not flush my toilet?

10:29.078 --> 10:32.480
Okay, Marlon, I didn't write a letter.

10:32.581 --> 10:34.182
Stevie made me hold this envelope.

10:36.785 --> 10:38.586
You lied to me about that storage unit.

10:38.687 --> 10:41.523
You knew it was there.
So I kept a few things.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.625
That's what people do,
they keep things.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.160
They keep it real.

10:46.962 --> 10:49.230
They keep their head up.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.799
They keep hope alive.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.737
Well, not anymore,
but you know what I mean.

10:55.804 --> 10:57.772
Okay, listen, when we got divorced,

10:57.840 --> 11:00.475
I had to get rid of everything
that connected me to our past.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.944
It's part of the healing process.

11:03.045 --> 11:05.223
I did the work, and I think
you need to do the work, too.

11:05.247 --> 11:10.919
Marlon, deep down inside,
we still love you.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.975
What the hell are you people
talking about?

11:34.076 --> 11:37.345
Let me intervene on my own
intervention, and I, too,

11:37.446 --> 11:39.847
will start in reverse order
of importance.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.016
Yvette.

11:42.117 --> 11:44.152
You got some nerve talking 'bout me

11:44.253 --> 11:46.688
when your apartment got kayaks

11:46.789 --> 11:49.824
and saddles and tractor-trailer tires.

11:49.892 --> 11:53.094
It look like the ghost of penises past.

11:53.162 --> 11:56.864
Ashley, you told him about
my situationships?

11:59.201 --> 12:01.002
And since we're being honest, Stevie,

12:01.103 --> 12:04.739
you always bragging about
your GPA at Howell University.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.041
Meanwhile, you're using
your hyper-intelligence

12:07.142 --> 12:10.044
to find new ways
to whack it undetected.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.149
Guess what, brother. We detect it!

12:15.217 --> 12:17.885
Oh, yeah, I checked
your web browser history.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.688
Busty, freckled gingers?

12:22.725 --> 12:25.793
Trust me, sisters, this is fake news!

12:29.932 --> 12:32.834
And forgive me, Ashley, that
I'm just not as callous as you.

12:32.901 --> 12:34.702
Hold on, what's this?

12:38.207 --> 12:41.309
That's a heart of steel.

12:41.377 --> 12:44.345
Or a nipple ring.

12:44.413 --> 12:47.849
Now, Marlon, if you truly
do not have a problem, prove it.

12:47.916 --> 12:49.217
Get rid of this old stuff.

12:49.318 --> 12:51.586
- Have a yard sale.
- Okay, fine.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.389
- Then pick a time and a day.
- Tomorrow.

12:54.490 --> 12:57.091
Hold on, let me check my PalmPilot.

12:58.894 --> 13:02.230
1998, 1999...

13:02.331 --> 13:03.598
I don't know about tomorrow.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.067
I got a Y2K prevention seminar

13:06.168 --> 13:08.770
that I got... I gotta attend.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.773
Okay, Marlon, listen.
I don't care about your hoarding

13:11.874 --> 13:13.885
because that doesn't affect me,
but I always thought

13:13.909 --> 13:16.377
that we were in the same place
emotionally.

13:16.445 --> 13:19.080
And if we're not,
then maybe we can't have

13:19.181 --> 13:22.283
this crazy, friendly divorce.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.019
Fine. We'll do it.

13:25.087 --> 13:28.923
If that proves to you guys that
I'm not a hoarder, then fine.

13:30.859 --> 13:32.393
If anything changes, just hit me

13:32.461 --> 13:36.297
on my Skytel Motorola two-way pager.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.933
Let me beam you my contact.

13:47.033 --> 13:49.276
- What are you selling?
- My college papers

13:49.277 --> 13:50.821
from Howell University.
I'm finally gonna turn

13:50.822 --> 13:52.767
that education into cold, hard cash.

13:52.768 --> 13:54.803
A lot of this stuff really holds up.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.938
"Why we will never elect
a black president."

13:57.006 --> 13:59.607
Just cross out "black"
and write "woman."

14:02.878 --> 14:05.613
I must say, I'm very impressed

14:05.681 --> 14:06.992
that you're going through with this.

14:07.016 --> 14:08.350
Tsk. Come on, please.

14:08.451 --> 14:11.186
This stuff? Easy to get rid of.

14:11.287 --> 14:12.597
How much for the Dru Hill T-shirt?

14:12.621 --> 14:15.857
Oh, ooh, uh...

14:15.958 --> 14:18.526
I don't know. That's a tough one.

14:18.627 --> 14:22.230
Dru Hill, 1999, "Enter the Dru" tour?

14:22.331 --> 14:24.199
Madison Square Garden?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.477
You know them brothers ain't gonna play

14:25.501 --> 14:27.502
a venue that big again.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.537
Man, that's gonna be 75.

14:29.638 --> 14:32.574
- Dollars?
- No, Chuck E. Cheese coins.

14:32.675 --> 14:34.509
Yeah, dollars. Man, you ain't serious.

14:34.577 --> 14:37.712
Get your ass out of here.

14:37.813 --> 14:40.415
Like you could fit in this.

14:40.516 --> 14:42.550
This happens on "Hoarders."

14:42.651 --> 14:44.753
Marlon, where are you
on the anxiety scale?

14:44.854 --> 14:47.489
Anxiety scale? I'm at a 2.

14:47.556 --> 14:49.657
In a Punch-a-Stevie-
in-the-Throat scale?

14:49.725 --> 14:52.560
Oh, about a 55.

14:52.661 --> 14:56.831
Aunt Yvette, why do you have
all of these random things?

14:56.899 --> 14:59.701
Oh, honey, Aunt Yvette
loses herself in men

14:59.769 --> 15:01.369
and their hobbies sometimes.

15:01.437 --> 15:03.671
But, baby girl,
today is a brand-new day,

15:03.739 --> 15:06.441
and the next man I meet
will have to like what I like.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.277
Pardon me, you don't have
a bicycle pump, do you?

15:09.378 --> 15:12.380
My unicycle tire's
running a little low.

15:12.448 --> 15:13.681
Unicycle?

15:15.618 --> 15:18.320
Sir, I'd really love
to sell you that metal detector,

15:18.321 --> 15:19.998
but then I would have to do
a background check,

15:20.022 --> 15:23.291
and to be honest, you look real shady.

15:23.392 --> 15:25.894
But if you're interested
in a boring-ass essay titled

15:25.961 --> 15:28.530
True American Hero,"

15:28.597 --> 15:30.432
you should check out table number two.

15:30.533 --> 15:32.534
Thank you very much.

15:32.601 --> 15:34.936
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
Moms Mabley.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.971
Where you going with that?
Who sold that to you?

15:37.073 --> 15:39.074
Oh, that lady there sold it to me.

15:39.141 --> 15:40.942
Ashley, what's the matter with you?

15:41.043 --> 15:43.078
I'm sorry, ma'am,
she shouldn't have done that.

15:43.145 --> 15:44.712
What's your plans for this item?

15:44.780 --> 15:46.948
Well, I have glaucoma,

15:47.049 --> 15:48.917
and I'm gon' turn it into a bong.

15:48.984 --> 15:50.919
Mmm.

15:50.986 --> 15:54.489
Yeah, it's not for sale.
A bong my behind.

15:54.590 --> 15:56.324
You gon' turn this into a crack pipe!

15:56.425 --> 15:58.393
I know a meth head when I see one!

15:58.461 --> 15:59.727
- Marlon!
- Damn, you strong

15:59.795 --> 16:01.830
- for an 80-year-old junkie!
- Okay!

16:01.931 --> 16:04.599
Let it go!

16:04.667 --> 16:07.969
I'm not letting it go, okay?
I did not authorize this sale.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.572
Scale of 1-10, where is your anxiety?

16:10.639 --> 16:14.476
I'm at a 8.5. Kinda 9.

16:14.577 --> 16:15.977
Marlon, why?

16:17.680 --> 16:20.115
Because, Ashley,
this-this metal detector,

16:20.182 --> 16:22.784
I got this the night
you lost your engagement ring

16:22.852 --> 16:24.819
on Venice Beach. Remember?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.521
And I stayed up all night,
and I found it

16:26.622 --> 16:27.989
underneath the volleyball net?

16:28.090 --> 16:30.091
And you were so happy,
we just made sweet love

16:30.159 --> 16:32.694
until beach patrol showed up,
and I know they was watching

16:32.795 --> 16:37.665
for at least 25 minutes 'cause,
oh, man, I wore it out.

16:37.766 --> 16:40.835
And this?
We watched "The Wiz" every night

16:40.936 --> 16:42.637
when you was pregnant with Marley

16:42.705 --> 16:44.105
because we couldn't afford cable,

16:44.173 --> 16:45.673
and then when she first cried,

16:45.774 --> 16:51.479
I swear it sounded like,
"A Teeny! A Teeny!"

16:51.547 --> 16:54.149
And this? This Dru Hill shirt?

16:54.216 --> 16:56.684
This was from the first concert
I took you to.

16:56.785 --> 16:58.925
We told each other that we loved
each other, remember?

16:58.988 --> 17:04.058
And this cup, this is my first
Father's Day, when you...

17:04.160 --> 17:06.994
You bought this for me and you
called me number one dad.

17:07.061 --> 17:09.564
And we taught Marley
to potty-train right here.

17:09.665 --> 17:14.569
And then when Zach was born,
we used it as his sippy cup.

17:14.670 --> 17:17.805
And this right here, this computer

17:17.873 --> 17:21.675
has our first sex tape in it!

17:21.743 --> 17:24.045
If we could just remember the code,

17:24.146 --> 17:26.181
we could get to our first sex tape!

17:28.884 --> 17:32.053
And you just want to go
and get rid of all this stuff

17:32.154 --> 17:34.856
'cause it's just stuff to you?

17:34.924 --> 17:38.826
Then fine, get rid of it.

17:38.894 --> 17:40.929
I'll be inside reading...

17:41.030 --> 17:43.398
A Passing Fad."

17:50.058 --> 17:52.689
<i>You know, Stevie is really smart.</i>

17:52.690 --> 17:55.426
He ain't right much...

17:55.527 --> 17:58.429
but the boy a genius.

17:58.530 --> 18:00.697
Yard sale's over.

18:00.765 --> 18:02.666
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

18:02.734 --> 18:06.003
You know, I was sitting here
trying to figure out

18:06.071 --> 18:09.540
why I was trying to hold on
to everything.

18:09.607 --> 18:12.543
It's just because it's evidence.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.211
Okay, evidence of what?

18:14.279 --> 18:18.282
Marlon and Ashley. The good old days.

18:18.383 --> 18:21.718
Look, Marlon, I got nostalgic
in that storage unit.

18:21.786 --> 18:24.221
That's why I wanted
to throw it all away.

18:24.289 --> 18:26.432
That's how I dealt with our divorce.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.263
I had to let go of everything
from the past

18:28.264 --> 18:30.394
so I could move on.

18:30.462 --> 18:33.063
Only I did it with booze
and prescription pills

18:33.131 --> 18:36.400
and a bonfire on the front lawn.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.368
You swiped my
"Waiting to Exhale" LaserDisc,

18:38.436 --> 18:40.404
huh?

18:40.472 --> 18:42.239
- That's cold.
- Marlon, please!

18:42.307 --> 18:44.908
Let's not act like good old days
were all good.

18:44.976 --> 18:46.410
Do you remember why we were looking

18:46.478 --> 18:48.312
for my engagement ring on the beach?

18:48.413 --> 18:50.944
You threw at me because I said
the bikini you were wearing

18:50.945 --> 18:54.051
gave you white girl butt.

18:54.119 --> 18:56.920
Yeah. You were very insensitive.

18:56.988 --> 18:58.783
No, because, listen, white girl butt

18:58.784 --> 19:01.925
is my third-favorite kind of butt...

19:01.993 --> 19:05.762
after sisters and Brazilians,
of course.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.664
Ah, and fourth, Puerto Ricans,
they got...

19:07.765 --> 19:10.334
Oh, my gosh!

19:10.435 --> 19:13.437
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't
recognize your compliment.

19:13.505 --> 19:15.506
Because you shallow, that's why.

19:17.942 --> 19:20.744
Yeah, those are some good old memories.

19:20.812 --> 19:24.081
Marlon, the memories are still here.

19:24.149 --> 19:26.450
We just don't need the stuff.

19:26.518 --> 19:31.622
Except for maybe... this.

19:31.689 --> 19:33.390
And I'm sorry.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.958
I need you to look at this again

19:35.026 --> 19:37.294
'cause ain't nothing white
about this booty.

19:39.497 --> 19:41.698
Yeah, that-that Tae Bo
was doing you right.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.534
Mm-hmm.

19:45.503 --> 19:47.771
Well, we got rid
of everything out there.

19:47.839 --> 19:49.473
I even sold a couple of my papers.

19:49.541 --> 19:50.874
Which ones?

19:50.975 --> 19:53.810
Oh, "R.I.P. Rap Music,"

19:53.878 --> 19:56.847
The Man Who Touched America"...

20:00.985 --> 20:03.053
He Don't Know."

20:05.390 --> 20:07.457
You know, it was a lot harder
parting with them

20:07.525 --> 20:09.493
than I thought,
but sometimes it's tough

20:09.561 --> 20:10.827
to let those memories go.

20:10.895 --> 20:12.963
I know one thing
I'm not gonna part with.

20:13.031 --> 20:15.499
Aww... friendship.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.068
Don't even say it.
I'll move back in tonight.

20:20.004 --> 20:22.005
I was talking about my PalmPilot.

20:22.073 --> 20:25.142
You know, I finally got my life
in order.

20:25.210 --> 20:26.610
- Wait, hold up.
- What?

20:26.678 --> 20:29.012
I lost the stylus.
Man, it's garbage now.

20:32.884 --> 20:35.419
Don't worry.
I'll get rid of everything.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.554
Oh, there's nothing left.
We sold it all.

20:37.622 --> 20:40.557
Girl, please. I have two storage spaces

20:40.625 --> 20:42.893
in the Valley, and a hidden crawl space

20:42.961 --> 20:46.029
somewhere in the house.

20:50.568 --> 20:54.037
Welcome to your intervention, Yvette.
