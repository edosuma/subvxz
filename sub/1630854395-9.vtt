of saying thank you.

I'm gonna text Sam
pretending to be a hot lady.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.176
"Hey, big guy.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.721
"Saw your pics,
and I think you're hot AF.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.933
Want to meet up?"

09:59.974 --> 10:03.353
And then we send a picture
of her hot pocket.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.981
- You want me to find
some pictures on the internet?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.484
- No.
That'll take too much time.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.069
Let me see your elbow.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.446
How does that look?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.825
It looks hairy, but...

10:16.866 --> 10:20.203
he probably hit puberty in the
'70s, so he'd probably like it.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.624
Squeeze it together closer.

Make love to the camera.
Make love.

Have fun!

You're happy.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.558
You're walking
through the park.

You're in New York.

- Hey, guys.

I'm not even gonna ask.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.692
I j--I wanted to say

10:50.734 --> 10:52.318
I appreciate you've been
spending time with my dad.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.778
And I have noticed

10:53.820 --> 10:56.031
that you have been cracking
fewer jokes at my expense.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.115
- So thank you.
- Yeah.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.742
Well, I'm sorry I'm slacking.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.952
I'll get right back on that,
Flavorless Flav.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.205
- Sam responded.
- Oh.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.168
"I'm sorry, but I'm married.

11:08.209 --> 11:12.047
But I hope that you find
a fulfilling relationship too."

11:13.923 --> 11:15.759

11:25.268 --> 11:27.062
come to dinner
and play silly games

11:27.103 --> 11:29.689
instead of redoing his poster.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.442
- Silly? If he gets
the zucchini out of the maze,

11:32.484 --> 11:34.027
we get $1 off dessert.

11:35.362 --> 11:39.199
- Oscar, I am so glad
you could take time off

11:39.240 --> 11:40.950

gardening schedule

11:40.992 --> 11:43.953
to join us for dinner.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.622
- Gardening?
- He's a gardener now.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.167
- Well, we got
a lot of good food.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.877
We got a lot of good martinis.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.171
There is something
about the Sizzlers

11:53.213 --> 11:55.507
that brings out
the best in humanity.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.095
- Can you believe
how much Sam is drinking?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.180
This isn't even the Sizzlers.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.434
- I think we found his vice.
He's an alcoholic.

- To Mayan.
- Oh, wow.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.548
all: To Mayan!

12:36.589 --> 12:38.216
I did that. [chuckles]

12:39.467 --> 12:42.387
- When my family is successful,
I'm successful.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.140
- That's one way
of measuring it.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.976
- You can also measure it
in compost.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.228
Yeah, I trained my worms
to eat coffee filters,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.605

to have sex with you?

Damn. You're cool.

Man, sex is the best.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.303
Me and my elbows used
this place last night.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.600
I gotta admit, Sam,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.268
when I first met you,
I was jealous, man,

13:30.310 --> 13:31.561
'cause I can't compete
with you.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.189
- No, no, no, no,
there is one area

13:34.230 --> 13:37.317
where you--you got me beat.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.280
Look at your daughter
compared with my son.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.782
What do you mean?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.576
I mean, Mayan is ambitious.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.911
She's successful.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.038
Quinten is weak.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.414
He's soft.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.208
He had a kid
when he was too young.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.793
He's in a dead-end job.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.670
He is...

13:56.711 --> 14:00.048
a massive disappointment.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.177
- Wow, man. And I just
call him Sadly Cooper.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.099
We found his dirty secret.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.684
Yeah, he's a judgmental jerk

14:10.725 --> 14:12.852
who talks trash about his son
behind his back.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.105
No. No panty lines.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.773
He doesn't wear underwear.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.693
That's why he doesn't have
any dirty laundry.

- Yeah.

- No.

Oh, wait.

Sorry, George.
You said you--

15:10.201 --> 15:11.119
there's something
I should know about my dad?

15:11.161 --> 15:13.163
Um...

15:13.204 --> 15:17.334

He's good at that.

he's got other priorities

with his kid.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.988
Yeah.

but it doesn't pay the bills.

know each other a long time,

16:12.430 --> 16:14.391

right now.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.185
You're wrong, okay?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.145
Quinten is successful, Sam,

16:19.187 --> 16:23.358
maybe just not in the way that
you and I measure it, okay?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.527
I mean, these kids
don't see a lifetime

16:25.568 --> 16:28.655
of grinding away at work
as the goal.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.241
- Then what the hell
is the goal?

16:31.282 --> 16:33.451
Damned if I know. [chuckles]

But you know what?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.499
They're happy, okay?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.001
I mean,
Quinten takes care of Mayan

16:41.042 --> 16:42.669
so she can pursue her dreams.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.046
He makes sure that
Chance knows that he's loved

16:45.088 --> 16:46.673
every single day.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.925
And he puts up with me,
and I can be a lot.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.680
But he's a better father
than you or I will ever be.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.349
So maybe he's not successful
at business,

16:56.391 --> 16:58.893
but he's successful at life.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.895
And that may be better.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.239
Hey, Mama?

17:11.281 --> 17:13.033
I've been thinking a lot
about Sam's toast.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.744
And the truth is,

17:15.785 --> 17:18.830
if it wasn't for you
teaching me about hard work,

17:18.872 --> 17:21.207

gotten to this point.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.793
Oh, thank you.

17:23.835 --> 17:28.048
Oh, and the truth is,
I did sabotage Chance's poster.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.424
Yes!

17:29.466 --> 17:31.426
I knew if I complimented you,
you'd admit it.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.428
Go ahead, Mayan. Ah!

17:35.180 --> 17:37.557
- Okay, sit down.
- Okay.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.519
- You know
what your problem is?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.897
You're too comfortable.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.148
I was hard on you

17:45.190 --> 17:47.192
because I knew the world
would be even harder.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.235
You think things are better now
for all Latinos

17:49.277 --> 17:50.904
because your life is good?

17:50.945 --> 17:53.365
I mean, a white kid
writes sloppy, and it's,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.909
"Oh, he has the handwriting
of a doctor."

17:55.950 --> 17:57.619
A Latino kid writes sloppy,
and it's,

[sighs] We have to work
three times as hard

18:03.458 --> 18:05.460

- Okay, I'll make Chance
redo the poster.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.884
And then?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.469
- I'll rip it up and make him
do it a third time.

Well, I wasn't drunk.

I must have been

18:44.457 --> 18:46.084
having a drunken hallucination.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.170
But you know what, man?
Your dad's a lot.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.673
Yes he is. [chuckles]

18:51.715 --> 18:56.761
Look, my dad's narrow-minded
definition of success

18:56.803 --> 18:59.973
is part of the reason
I moved away from North Dakota.

Also, I'm scared of bison,
and they are everywhere.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.399

- No.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.192
I don't, uh...

19:11.234 --> 19:12.819
I don't talk about it with her

19:12.861 --> 19:15.739
'cause they got a great bond
and I don't want to ruin that.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.823
Mm.

it's just--

to a successful dad.

It's awesome Mayan never had
to deal with that.

19:32.255 --> 19:36.468

the fact that I was a screw-up

with no standards for myself
or others

19:38.636 --> 19:41.014

You hear that, Mayan?

for all your success!

- Y-you--
- Yeah.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.799
- You just eat them
out of the package cold?

20:57.841 --> 21:00.093
- Didn't we talk
about you judging people less?

21:02.053 --> 21:03.430
Sorry. Sorry.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.766
And I apologized
to Quinten earlier.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.519
- Damn.
I should be a therapist.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.062
Therapy?

21:11.104 --> 21:13.106
Yeah, Quinten's been trying
to get me to go for years.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.816
No, thank you.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.570
- Mayan's been trying
to get me to go too.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.988
Why do we need therapy?
We're perfect.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.741
- And so is
this room-temperature wiener.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.786
- I really hope you're talking
about the hot dog.
