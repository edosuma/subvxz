WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.878
PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar…

00:02.961 --> 00:04.129
NEAL: The <i>Mosconi Codex.</i>

00:04.213 --> 00:06.089
This is no ordinary book.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.091
MOZZIE: <i>I think Hagen is using you.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.385
The only chance we have
of getting a leg up on him

00:10.469 --> 00:12.971
is by deciphering the codex first.

00:13.055 --> 00:15.098
-Neal took off, didn't he?
-JONES: <i>Yeah, he sure did.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:16.600
Find out where he went.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.811
Surveillance cameras a block from
the vodka room led us to a cabbie.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.480
Is there any reason
he'd slip away to come here?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.023
PETER: Neal always has a reason.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.107
You okay?

00:24.191 --> 00:27.110
I can't exhale until I hear you
walk through that door at night.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.781
PETER: <i>Agent Siegel's murder</i>
<i>was a random act of violence.</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:33.283
But it's not gonna happen to me.
I promise.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.537
But the codex has been hidden away
its entire existence.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.829
How did you get a copy?

00:37.913 --> 00:41.375
-Our copy of the codex is incomplete.
-How much do you have?

00:41.458 --> 00:44.127
A single chapter. It's chapter 13.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.299
In all the books he ever produced,
he never wrote a chapter 13.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.561
Haircut, new suit.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.895
What's the occasion?

01:01.979 --> 01:04.648
On this very day,
I walked into a downtown art gallery

01:04.731 --> 01:06.358
and first laid eyes on my future wife.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.404
Ah, routine art crime investigation
turns into the luckiest day of your life.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.572
I agree.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.782
And to celebrate,
we're going to the same restaurant

01:13.866 --> 01:14.950
we went to on our first date.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.034
Papaya King?

01:16.118 --> 01:18.078
La Cucina di Tua Nonna.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.747
Red sauce, wine in straw bottles.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.332
Napkin tucked into your collar?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.961
I'm making it a point to
remember all the anniversaries.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.880
Birthdays, weddings,

01:27.963 --> 01:29.756
the day we brought Satchmo home
from the breeders.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.133
I imagined a stork delivery.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.927
-December 7th.
-Pearl Harbor day?

01:34.011 --> 01:36.096
Another day that will live in infamy.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.472
First time I arrested you.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.142
Mmm. And four years later
we did it all over again.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.186
-Yeah.
-But this time, you gave me jewelry.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.272
PETER: Oh-ho, which is why I asked you
to meet me here.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.651
I removed your anklet for our
undercover operation at the vodka room.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.030
Soon after, I found this.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.158
Don't we have hundreds
of those back at the office?

01:56.992 --> 01:59.953
I have a hunch
this has special significance.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.789
Office building, 56th Street.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.917
Gravich Chiropractic.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.294
-Our next case.
-Could be mine.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.462
I'm here to help.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.297
You can go home now.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.259
This year, skip the straw bottle wine.
Spring for some Sangiovese.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.386
I'll order what I always order.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.439
I downloaded it to my phone
so I'd always have it with me.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.107
ELIZABETH: I still love Italian.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.485
I still love you.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.156
So, am I the first guy
you ever made a sign for?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.617
It was the first sign
that didn't say "Go away."

02:38.700 --> 02:41.328
Oh! It wouldn't have discouraged me.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.998
Did you ever think where you would be

02:45.082 --> 02:46.959
if you didn't walk into my gallery
that day?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.418
Nope. Never.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.962
Too scary to think about.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.131
How's work going? Getting any better?

02:54.258 --> 02:57.678
Yeah, we added Siegel's
picture to the honor wall.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.054
That was something, at least.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.809
Hey, what kind of celebration is this?

03:03.976 --> 03:05.936
-Glasses are almost empty.
-Thank you.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.479
WAITER: <i>Scusi.</i>

03:07.563 --> 03:09.439
Oh. Uh, we didn't order these.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.449
What's wrong? Do you know her?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.743
I think I do.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.290
That's Jill.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.499
Jill.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.710
From Quantico.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.045
Oh, that's Jill?

03:33.380 --> 03:36.842
Right. My ex-girlfriend.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.137
-JILL: Peter.
-Yes.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.639
JILL: It's been a long time.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.558
20 years long. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

03:46.143 --> 03:49.062
I never thought I'd see you here, tonight.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.480
I hunted you down.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.525
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.485
It's great to meet you.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.988
Uh, wait, I've interrupted something.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.450
Oh, no. This is just an average
Tuesday night for us, right?

04:01.533 --> 04:02.534
(CHUCKLES)

04:02.743 --> 04:04.244
Come on, sit down. Join us.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.122
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.876
(CHUCKLES)

04:11.960 --> 04:15.589
So, what are you doing in New York?

04:16.006 --> 04:18.592
I'm on a case. Thought I'd look you up.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
How'd you find me?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.012
That's what I do, Peter.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.431
You still in SSG?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.058
Last time I checked in.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.101
What's SSG?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.437
SSG is Special Surveillance Group.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.274
We track down the bad guys, follow them,
record them if we can.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.818
-Sounds fascinating.
-You still drink bourbon?

04:36.902 --> 04:37.986
On occasion.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.447
Well, this is a damn special one.
How about you?

04:40.864 --> 04:42.115
Sure, why not?

04:42.407 --> 04:43.909
Remember our toast?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.411
Truth, justice…

04:46.495 --> 04:48.080
And stay out of our way.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.343
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:19.403 --> 05:21.238
Here it is.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.576
Every time I passed this house

05:25.659 --> 05:28.120
I was tempted to knock
and ask for a look inside.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.246
NEAL: Well, you should have.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.165
My landlady would have invited
you in for coffee.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.210
God, it's like a good book
I'm finally getting to read.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.171
I can't believe you live here.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.840
Well, I just rent the epilogue.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.675
Can I get you a glass of wine?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.053
FBI agents are allowed to drink
on the job?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.513
Well, we're always on the job.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.931
What choice do we have?

05:48.015 --> 05:51.643
And now that you're joining us,
I'm gonna corrupt you, too.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.106
Thank you.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.234
So where's this phantom
chapter 13 of yours?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.112
Right here.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.367
-It can't be.
-Why? What's wrong?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.995
What's wrong is that it's right.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.625
It's a Mosconi, but that's impossible.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.169
That would make it the only
chapter 13 that he ever made.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.714
Well, it was copied directly from
the codex at the Gershon Museum.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.883
It is his handwriting.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.718
This is crazy.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.596
And this. Here.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.724
It's a study for a painting.

06:30.807 --> 06:34.102
That he didn't put on canvas
until a year after this was published.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.772
So these pages, they couldn't
have been done by anyone else.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.066
And this has to be
from his New York period.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.318
1886. He was here less than a year.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.071
FBI art crimes database.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.243
Maybe he wrote his only
chapter 13 in New York as well.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.662
Well, Mosconi rushed back
to Italy in a hurry.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.163
The why he ran is a mystery.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.333
And the book he left us
is more of a what than a why.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.669
He was a puzzling man who loved puzzles.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.463
See, Mosconi believed that
if someone wanted the truth,

07:01.547 --> 07:02.881
they should have to search for it.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.925
What are you doing?

07:05.801 --> 07:09.763
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.310
Look at that.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.062
Come here.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.314
REBECCA: Oh, my gosh.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.943
NEAL: Here's one.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.117
Where's the middle?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.121
It's gotta be here somewhere.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.013
REBECCA: It's incredible.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.056
NEAL: It looks like
a stained glass window.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.226
But if he wrote chapter 13
when he was in New York,

07:56.310 --> 07:58.520
this stained glass window
could be right here in Manhattan.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.567
Do you realize what you've just done?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.320
Made a mess of the codex?

08:06.403 --> 08:09.990
No, I think you might have just made
one of the most important discoveries

08:10.073 --> 08:11.742
on Mosconi in decades.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.120
MOZZIE: Working into the night?

08:15.204 --> 08:16.455
Impressive.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.374
You should know
the FBI frowns on overtime.

08:19.458 --> 08:23.378
-We've made incredible progress, sir.
-Yes.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.130
I'm gonna let Agent Caffrey fill you in.

08:25.506 --> 08:30.594
You know, I'm gonna research this window.
See if I can find out where it is.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.722
Yeah, I'll put my FBI resources
on it as well.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.559
-We can see who finds it first.
-Okay.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.563
What?

08:42.898 --> 08:45.859
You, business, and women,
the unholy trinity.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.820
Rebecca is all about
the business of the codex.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.906
Oh, like I've never seen this before.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.034
Kate, Alex, Sara.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.494
Now Rebecca.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.412
There's more behind this than the codex.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.456
So you're an expert on romance now?

09:00.123 --> 09:03.418
One who has loved not wisely but too well.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.088
-Othello.
-Yeah.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.673
We all know how that turned out.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.014
You okay?

09:16.098 --> 09:17.850
Pretty quiet on the way home.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.394
Well, I didn't want to break the spell.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.479
Oh, look, honey.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.982
Jill challenged me.

09:25.065 --> 09:29.069
You know that I didn't enter Quantico
all that sure of myself.

09:29.778 --> 09:34.366
But she tried so hard to beat me
that I worked my butt off to beat her.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.076
-And…
-Look at you now.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.036
No, that's not what I meant.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.790
It's just that I never thought
that I could finish as high as I did.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.125
You know that.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.214
You're the reason I'm the man I am today.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.843
Continue.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.060
I couldn't have gotten through
this past year without you.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.729
Or…

10:04.938 --> 10:06.064
Any year.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.368
You know, it's still our anniversary.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.871
Oh. I was hoping you'd say that.

10:30.255 --> 10:34.009
PETER: Thank you, Detective.
Right, well, let's hope it does.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.470
Bye. We'll take it from here.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.389
That was NYPD.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.226
Two days ago someone in Brooklyn
commandeered a vehicle

10:42.309 --> 10:44.019
posing as an FBI agent.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.646
Yesterday he struck again.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.147
-Did he flash a badge?
-Mmm-hmm.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.149
NYPD doesn't know if it's real or not.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.734
Or if it could be Siegel's.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.154
Chances are slight that it is,
but we need to check it out.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.573
Could be our first solid lead
in two weeks.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.116
I want you and Jones on this.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.119
Two people I trust. Well, one and a half.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.999
-Who is that?
-Ah, no one important.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.918
Come up with something to catch this guy.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.294
-Now go.
-You seem nervous.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.963
Just leave, just leave.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.881
Hey.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.466
Neal Caffrey.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.009
Do we know each other?

11:16.093 --> 11:19.388
Jill Stone. I stayed up all night
reading the case files of you two.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.472
Couldn't put it down.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.099
The good ones keep you up at night.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.934
Mmm-hmm. The bad ones even longer.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.811
(CHUCKLES) He was just leaving.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.401
-I wasn't expecting you.
-We're a secretive bunch.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.364
Tell me we're looking at the same thing.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.116
NEAL: Peter Burke uncomfortable.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.243
That's not his natural state.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.078
You know she's FBI?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.289
Well, it's not your run of the mill suit.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.834
Not that she ever wears one.
Look at the way she holds herself.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.961
Open. Totally exposed.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.089
Confidence and plenty of it.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.676
NEAL: Ooh! Well, that's not the first time
she's touched him like that.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.219
-Uh-uh.
-They have a past.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.180
JONES: Look at her eyes.
All over his face.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.931
Yeah, she wants to see
if he still feels anything.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.016
JONES: Uh-huh.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.934
-NEAL: Whoa.
-Whoa what?

12:06.018 --> 12:07.561
-They slept together.
-Peter?

12:07.644 --> 12:08.937
Not recently.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.982
All right, you know I heard
he had a pretty serious relationship

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
with a female agent down at Quantico.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.320
She joined SSG.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.030
The CIA of the FBI?

12:18.113 --> 12:19.364
Those are some badass agents.

12:19.448 --> 12:22.284
That explains the confidence.
That's Peter's ex.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.077
It has to be.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.001
I couldn't talk about
the case in front of your wife.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.377
White Collar related?

12:32.461 --> 12:35.297
I'm tracking a tech genius
named Mason Sadowski.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.049
PETER: Doesn't look all that intimidating.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.343
JILL: In today's world
that's what trouble looks like.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.013
He's part of a team that invented
a new and extremely dangerous microchip

12:43.096 --> 12:44.932
for one of our top defense contractors.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.935
-Then he decided he didn't want to share?
-Exactly.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.269
Must be a very important chip.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.022
Something to do with decoding passwords.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.316
With it, a two-bit hacker
could break through

12:54.399 --> 12:56.193
our most sophisticated security walls.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.028
Low-hanging fruit for our enemies.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.988
Yeah, he put it on the black market.

13:00.072 --> 13:03.116
I've established a cover ID
as a broker for Iran.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.451
Set the hook yet?

13:04.618 --> 13:05.827
-He swallowed it.
-Good.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.496
Waiting for a buy time to reel him in.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.835
My problem, most buyers representing
foreign interests come in twos.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.337
In order for the ruse to work,
I need a partner.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.883
Someone with undercover experience.
Someone you can trust.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.760
More than any other agent in New York.

13:23.095 --> 13:26.557
Section Chief Bruce Hawes put
the order through personally.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.809
-Oh, Bruce, huh?
-Not only Bruce.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.602
Your name gets dropped a lot
in Washington.

13:30.769 --> 13:31.937
Nice to hear.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.982
You know New York, and I don't have GPS.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.943
Besides, you're the best.
Next to me, of course.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.279
Oh! That was Quantico. This is now.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.989
I'll set up the buy.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.326
This is gonna be fun.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.996
-Got that, too.
-Here.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.206
-Good to see you.
-Take care. Bye.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.045
-She left Peter with a lot to think about.
-Uh-huh.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.881
Get back to work!

14:01.008 --> 14:02.759
And still uncomfortable.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.762
-Oh, hey, you got plans later?
-Why?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.848
ASAC gave us an assignment.

14:08.432 --> 14:12.519
NYPD informed Peter someone may be
using Siegel's badge in Brooklyn.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.147
All right, I'll coordinate with NYPD.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.982
We'll need the perp's
description and his MO

14:17.065 --> 14:18.483
so we know what we're looking for.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.111
Or we help him find us.

14:23.197 --> 14:26.533
PETER: Jill's just an FBI agent
who needs help on a case.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.368
That's it. End of story.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.037
You never look at Jones like that.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.997
-Drop it.
-Hold on a second.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.958
Does El know that your old ex
is your new partner?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.461
I'm gonna tell her tonight
when it's more relaxed.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.505
All right, at least give up the details.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.340
-What broke you two lovers up?
-I don't know.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.718
She went west, I went east.
It doesn't matter anymore.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.720
-It always matters.
-No, what matters

14:46.803 --> 14:49.056
is that you catch the guy
flashing the badge.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.183
All right, Jones and I are
gonna cruise Brooklyn tonight

14:51.266 --> 14:53.560
in sheep's clothing, but…

14:53.644 --> 14:54.978
But what?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.481
The wolves need a sleeker wardrobe.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.610
Yes!

15:02.486 --> 15:03.820
Drop me off.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.577
-ELIZABETH: Dinner's almost ready.
-Mmm.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.121
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:13.205 --> 15:16.416
-Jill came to my office today.
-I figured she would.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.795
Why don't you pour me a glass of wine
and tell me all about it?

15:20.337 --> 15:21.547
What kind of wine is this?

15:21.630 --> 15:25.008
Oh, that's the bottle Mozzie gave us last
Christmas you were afraid to open.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.093
Still am.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.719
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

15:27.803 --> 15:29.429
-You expecting someone?
-No.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.811
Oh. Hi, Elizabeth. Um…

15:36.228 --> 15:39.398
Wow, it smells like Italy in here.
I forgot people still make dinner.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.441
I forgot people just drop by.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.026
I'm so sorry I keep interrupting you.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.404
I should have called first,
but we're just kind of in a rush.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.905
-"We"?
-Oh, Peter.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.240
I found where the guy's holed up,

15:48.323 --> 15:51.326
so we gotta do recon on the thing now,
right now.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.203
You guys workin' on a case together?

15:53.954 --> 15:57.958
That's why Jill is in New York
and since it was White Collar related…

15:58.542 --> 16:00.669
-What's it about?
-Mmm, it's classified.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.839
Oh, well, nothing we discuss
ever leaves this house.

16:03.922 --> 16:04.965
I'm sorry, hon.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.633
We can't discuss this one.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.137
-You okay?
-Why wouldn't I be?

16:10.220 --> 16:11.930
I'll call you on my way home.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.309
-I'll try to get him home in one piece.
-Yeah.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.239
Do you live in this?

16:29.323 --> 16:30.866
When I have to.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.076
All you're missing
is a fridge and a hot plate.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.871
JILL: Well, I'm thinking about putting in
a fireplace and Jacuzzi.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.790
-That'd be nice.
-How come you're still in the field?

16:39.124 --> 16:40.959
I mean, you had big ambitions
way back then.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.003
I expected you to be
assistant director by now.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.838
I'm on a Washington track.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.508
For the time being,
I'm serving double duty.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.384
ASAC and Neal's handler.

16:50.802 --> 16:51.929
I'm pretty happy doing both.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.223
-Peter.
-What?

16:54.306 --> 16:56.266
You don't have to put up
a strong front for me.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.479
You were the supervisor
of an agent who got killed.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.231
I know you're hurting.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.858
The entire bureau is.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.485
Yeah.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.737
It's been hard to shake it.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.949
I lost my partner eight years ago.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.909
Still can't.

17:16.495 --> 17:20.123
Cruisin' for the bad guy in a sweet ride,
just like Crockett and Tubbs.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.084
I am living the dream.

17:22.543 --> 17:24.878
Did you base your entire
future on <i>Miami Vice?</i>

17:25.212 --> 17:28.966
<i>Hill Street Blues, Cagney & Lacey,</i>
any show about law enforcement.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.386
-I had a different perspective.
-Let me guess, rooting for the bad guys?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.971
Only when they were good, Cagney.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.058
We've been driving around
for about three hours.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.226
Where is this guy?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.731
We were chasing a couple
that robbed a bank in Pomona.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.775
They split up. I followed the guy.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.695
Earl was following the girl.
She pretended to surrender.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.238
She shot him.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.866
Is that why you work alone?

17:56.285 --> 17:58.996
It wasn't my fault,
but it still feels like it was.

18:00.831 --> 18:06.086
Siegel used to come to my office
and just want to hear about my old cases.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.713
He couldn't get enough.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.968
I brought him here from Chicago.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.013
David was my responsibility.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.432
Can't protect everybody.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.392
No.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.060
And you can't take their place.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.271
Even though sometimes
you wish you could.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.355
Mmm.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.192
Any closer to finding the killer?

18:28.483 --> 18:32.196
Not yet. Today we got a potential lead.

18:33.739 --> 18:34.948
You'll find him.

18:35.032 --> 18:38.410
Justice is not always
as swift as we want it to be.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.498
Isn't that our guy?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, he's out of his room.
Now's our chance.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.720
-What?
-I don't know.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.430
Bad feeling.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.353
JONES: I hope we don't get jacked
before our perp shows up.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.075
-Hold on a second.
-Whoa, what are you doing?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.285
You know Peter doesn't like
folks touching his buttons.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.870
Trying to get a better view.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.040
Looks like your hope
is about to come true.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.959
-On your left.
-Yeah?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.338
MAN: I need your car.
Official FBI business.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.548
Yep.

19:32.631 --> 19:33.882
Get out now! Criminal's getting away.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.801
-JONES: Be cool, man!
-How are we gonna get our car back?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.428
Real FBI.

19:38.512 --> 19:39.763
Hands on the roof.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.140
What do you got?

19:51.525 --> 19:52.526
(GROANS)

19:52.818 --> 19:54.486
I would have had you if I wore flats.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.280
Well, I never knew you
to make excuses before.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.073
Okay, you won that one.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.617
-Savor it, because it'll be your last.
-Okay.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.911
Thanks for letting us in.
Honeymooners, right?

20:02.995 --> 20:05.330
-Always forgetting something.
-MAN: <i>Sí, señor.</i>

20:05.956 --> 20:07.374
Come on, let's find a place
to stash the gun

20:07.457 --> 20:09.293
in case we get patted down
before the buy.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.587
PETER: You think he took the chip
with him?

20:11.670 --> 20:14.089
If I thought so,
I would have taken him outside.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.258
Then maybe he left it here.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.719
Give me the gun.

20:47.164 --> 20:50.417
You could have had any assignment
you wanted when we left Quantico.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.044
Why Los Angeles?

20:56.673 --> 20:59.593
-Hey, that looks familiar.
-Yeah.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.470
Same guys we passed on our way in.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.097
They might be competitive
shoppers for our chip.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.183
Let's find out who they are.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.894
Take a selfie
like we're a couple on a date.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.939
Come on, closer. We gotta sell it.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.984
(PHONE RINGING)

21:19.988 --> 21:21.573
Neal, you got him?

21:26.245 --> 21:29.665
-You left him bleeding on the sidewalk.
-A bullet in his chest.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.959
-An FBI agent.
-One of us.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.711
I didn't kill the dude.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.047
I pulled that badge and gun
outta the trash. I swear.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.131
(SCOFFS)

21:39.758 --> 21:44.388
You know, when a murderer swears,
I tend not to believe them.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.431
It was a Friday.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.976
About a month ago.
When people cash their G checks.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.644
Oh, yeah?

21:51.353 --> 21:53.313
What time of day was it?

21:53.397 --> 21:55.065
Later. Almost dark.

21:55.858 --> 21:59.027
Where were you before that?
Between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m.?

21:59.111 --> 22:00.112
I don't remember.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.280
"I don't remember". Well, you know what?

22:01.363 --> 22:03.782
It doesn't matter because you've got
the badge and you've got the gun.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.033
And your prints are all over them.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.077
You're going down for this.

22:08.871 --> 22:09.997
Let's go.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.875
-My skin is starting to crawl.
-No, wait, wait.

22:13.709 --> 22:16.837
When your guy got hit,
I was inside Dante's Liquor.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.755
PETER: For an hour?

22:18.839 --> 22:21.300
Waited till it emptied out
so I could rob it.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.094
The place was crowded
and full of cash on check day.

22:24.178 --> 22:27.598
Look, check it out.
The store's got cameras. They don't lie.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.856
Get in there with him.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.444
Head down to the liquor store.
I want to see that footage.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.862
Yeah.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.198
Look, you got him to talk.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.575
Peter.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.453
You did everything you could.

23:33.705 --> 23:34.831
Are you okay?

23:34.915 --> 23:36.083
You're awake?

23:36.542 --> 23:37.960
I always wait up for you.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.003
Well, sometimes you fall asleep.

23:40.087 --> 23:41.463
Not this time.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.719
Tell me all about it.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.471
(SIGHS)

23:50.806 --> 23:52.391
It's classified.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.226
Oh, come on.

23:55.978 --> 23:58.772
It's not like Jill will ever find out.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.357
I can't.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.359
We always discuss your cases.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.904
I know, but I…
And I can't wait to tell you about it.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.866
But, not until it's done.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.493
What's so special about this one?

24:15.247 --> 24:16.999
I'm sorry, it's…

24:17.708 --> 24:18.959
Classified.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.004
(SIGHS)

24:27.926 --> 24:29.803
You understand, right?

24:31.054 --> 24:32.431
Of course I do.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.600
I'm an FBI wife.

24:42.024 --> 24:47.446
Facial recognition scan pegged them
as Eric Healey and Robert Bly.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.073
They're both ex-black ops.

24:50.741 --> 24:55.037
They've been freelancing for some of
our lesser known defense contractors.

24:55.621 --> 24:57.122
JILL: They're high-end mercenaries.

24:57.247 --> 25:01.335
Yeah, it does look like we're not
the only ones hunting our genius.

25:01.877 --> 25:04.588
Rival defense contractors
would do anything for that technology.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.715
I think these guys
are looking to be the new sellers.

25:06.798 --> 25:09.259
Which means they're not gonna buy it,
they're gonna steal it.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.140
Hey, Elizabeth Burke.

25:15.224 --> 25:18.060
Bearing gifts in a brown paper bag.
I can only imagine.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.312
Oh, it's just his lunch.
He forgot it this morning.

25:22.439 --> 25:23.607
Why aren't you in there?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.817
Ah, scratched off the need to know list.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.653
Yeah, me, too.

25:28.946 --> 25:31.323
-Come on, let's go in.
-No, Neal, I'm not that kind of wife.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.075
Well, I'm definitely that kind of CI.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.911
-No, I'll just leave it on his desk.
-All right.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.123
What do we think of this Jill?

25:41.083 --> 25:42.251
There's need for further study.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.628
I think she's lonely.

25:45.629 --> 25:47.464
Well, she lives out of an '86 Chevy.

25:47.548 --> 25:49.049
I doubt she throws
a lot of dinner parties.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.968
She never got married.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.220
Peter could be the last man
she ever loved.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.348
Twenty years is a long time to go
without loving someone else.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.560
You fall in love with Peter, you…
You are in love.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.187
I can't imagine those feelings
ever going away.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.272
Not completely.

26:03.564 --> 26:04.815
Really?

26:04.898 --> 26:06.483
Peter Burke?
The man in the conference room?

26:07.484 --> 26:08.986
You have no idea.

26:10.571 --> 26:11.738
PETER: <i>This is good.</i>

26:11.822 --> 26:14.116
We'll have Jones coordinate with NYPD.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.159
We'll get a current location of the SUV.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.829
He can trail it
and give us updates of its whereabouts.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.123
No. Peter. I think I was pretty clear.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.292
No one else can know anything.
No one else can be involved.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.918
It's my case, my rules.

26:25.002 --> 26:26.044
It's our case.

26:26.295 --> 26:29.006
I brought you in on this.
Don't make me take you off.

26:29.089 --> 26:32.134
You brought it to White Collar,
and I'm ASAC here.

26:32.551 --> 26:34.803
We'll do it our way or you're out.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.138
You're not serious.

26:37.723 --> 26:39.391
This face doesn't look serious to you?

26:41.810 --> 26:43.854
Okay, ASAC.

26:45.230 --> 26:48.692
Jones keeps tabs, he reports back to us,
but we don't tell him why.

26:48.942 --> 26:49.943
Agreed.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.493
Yeah.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.066
-I'm gonna say hi to El.
-JONES: Yep.

27:41.203 --> 27:42.788
NEAL: Did you call her?

27:42.871 --> 27:44.706
I did. El couldn't have been sweeter.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.625
-That's good, right?
-It's terrible.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.585
When she's upset with me,

27:48.669 --> 27:51.713
she makes herself
irresistible and unavailable.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.799
-Nice technique.
-Drives me crazy.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.051
All right, go home, talk to her in person.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.928
I can't.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.847
Jill's setting something up.

27:59.930 --> 28:03.141
If I have to leave El
mid-apology to meet Jill…

28:03.642 --> 28:06.228
So just assign a different agent
to work with Jill.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.230
(SIGHS) This case is too important.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.524
Besides, she doesn't trust anyone else.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.733
Okay.

28:12.609 --> 28:15.195
Is it about the case or is it about Jill?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.534
I can talk to Jill about losing David.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.536
She's been through it herself.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.539
And you don't want to worry El
any more than she already is.

28:25.622 --> 28:28.000
I don't.
She's been through enough this year.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.919
Enough to believe
that other bad things are possible.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.963
El knows that I'm in love with her.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.048
-She trusts me.
-Trusts?

28:35.257 --> 28:36.675
Now you see it, now you don't.

28:41.263 --> 28:42.514
I have to go.

28:42.723 --> 28:45.517
Thing I can't talk about? It's going down.

28:45.726 --> 28:48.520
-MOZZIE: You must follow him.
-Look, I am not following him.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.730
I'm not following my husband.

28:49.813 --> 28:51.690
He's never given me reason
not to trust him.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.358
-Until now.
-Mozzie.

28:53.442 --> 28:56.862
You can trust truffles
harvested in the Perigord region,

28:56.945 --> 28:59.072
bed linens handwoven in Madeira,

28:59.156 --> 29:02.034
and, for the most part,
a teddy bear named Mozart.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.203
But people? Almost never.

29:04.286 --> 29:05.329
You trust Neal.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.875
Neal is the reason
"never" was preceded by "almost."

29:09.958 --> 29:11.168
I'm not following Peter.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.419
-You must.
-I won't.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.755
-You must.
-No.

29:15.589 --> 29:16.924
Then follow the woman.

29:17.299 --> 29:20.969
Or does your intrepid faith in the Suit
extend to her as well?

29:25.390 --> 29:26.975
PETER: (ON PHONE) <i>What do you have?</i>
JONES: Yeah, Peter.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.061
I followed the SUV to the Village.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.063
They just parked
and went into a restaurant.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.481
PETER: <i>Thanks, Jones.</i>
<i>Let me know when they leave.</i>

29:32.564 --> 29:33.774
JONES: <i>Okay.</i>

29:35.025 --> 29:37.027
PETER: Mercenaries
just went into a restaurant.

29:37.110 --> 29:39.488
That meal should keep 'em on the shelf
until we make the buy.

29:39.696 --> 29:42.699
Well, they're after the chip.
Why stop for a meal?

29:42.783 --> 29:44.785
They don't know
our buy's going down now.

29:45.035 --> 29:46.995
Even bad guys got to eat.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.458
You and the missus okay?
She left the office in kind of a hurry.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.545
Yeah, she was just dropping by a sandwich.

29:54.962 --> 29:56.129
Sweet.

29:56.630 --> 29:59.424
I depend on the kindness of delivery guys.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.385
You never got married?

30:01.468 --> 30:02.803
Who would put up with me?

30:03.679 --> 30:05.013
(PHONE RINGS)

30:08.100 --> 30:09.184
<i>-Yeah?</i>
-Yeah, Peter.

30:09.268 --> 30:10.769
I've got a bad feeling about this.

30:10.853 --> 30:11.979
We don't have eyes on the rear.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.106
Requesting permission for a walk-through.

30:15.232 --> 30:17.317
Can't he just do a simple walk-through?

30:17.401 --> 30:19.403
It's not part of the agreement.
You tell him to stand by.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.365
Don't go.

30:24.074 --> 30:25.409
She doesn't want me to go. You do.

30:25.492 --> 30:26.827
-Right.
-JONES: <i>Gotcha.</i>

30:28.745 --> 30:30.289
-I'm going in.
-AGENT: Got it.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.333
Mozzie was supposed to help me, but…

30:33.417 --> 30:36.044
-Bunion removal. I heard all about it.
-ELIZABETH: Okay.

30:36.545 --> 30:39.381
This is where I think she's staying.

30:40.591 --> 30:41.925
I want you to come with me.

30:42.009 --> 30:43.969
I hear she stays at the '86 Caprice.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.096
I saw a picture of them
in front of this hotel.

30:46.180 --> 30:47.973
Close. Extremely close.

30:48.056 --> 30:50.642
And she looked smitten,
but he looked like he wanted to go home.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.060
Because he's in love with you.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.855
I know that. What I don't know
is her intentions with him.

30:54.938 --> 30:57.399
I mean, he's not an ordinary man,
but he is a man.

30:57.482 --> 31:00.444
If they are there, it's for the case
and that could be dangerous.

31:00.527 --> 31:01.695
That's why I need you.

31:04.031 --> 31:06.617
If you don't go with me,
I'm gonna go alone.

31:07.409 --> 31:08.702
Wait.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.496
I'll drive. You're too angry.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.586
-I'm tired of sitting. Let's go.
-We're early.

31:17.669 --> 31:18.921
We'll catch him off guard.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.339
Or tip him off.

31:20.422 --> 31:22.216
I've done this before, Peter.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.811
Look, they're probably not even here.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.192
Okay, they're here.

31:47.324 --> 31:49.034
That is not what it looked like.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.410
It better not be.

32:06.635 --> 32:07.636
(SIGHS)

32:07.719 --> 32:08.887
You know…

32:08.971 --> 32:10.722
I really thought
I was gonna see both of them

32:10.806 --> 32:12.975
sitting on stools so close to
each other they were touching.

32:13.517 --> 32:17.062
You know, Peter having a beer
and Jill having whatever women have

32:17.145 --> 32:18.647
when they're sitting
with someone else's husband.

32:18.730 --> 32:19.857
All right, don't jump to conclusions.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.483
Too late. Already jumped.

32:21.567 --> 32:22.776
Wait at the bar.

32:22.860 --> 32:25.028
I'll pull a room number
out of the desk clerk.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.614
If there is a room number.

32:32.703 --> 32:34.037
Mercenaries are gone.

32:34.121 --> 32:36.081
They must have ID'd us
and snuck out the back of the restaurant.

32:36.164 --> 32:39.626
I want you to put the tac team on alert.
I'm calling Peter.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.005
(PHONE RINGING)

32:43.922 --> 32:46.592
SSG procedure. Radio silence.

32:50.304 --> 32:52.389
Okay, start tracking
Peter's cell phone now.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.808
He might be walking into an ambush.

33:01.690 --> 33:02.691
(PHONE RINGING)

33:04.193 --> 33:05.527
-NEAL: <i>Elizabeth.</i>
-Neal.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.738
A man from Peter's file is in the bar.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.823
That's why they're here. It was the case.

33:09.907 --> 33:11.158
NEAL: <i>I told you not to jump.</i>

33:11.909 --> 33:13.744
I'm sure Peter's looking for him.

33:13.827 --> 33:15.162
I think I could stall him.

33:15.245 --> 33:16.538
Call Peter for me, okay?

33:16.622 --> 33:18.207
NEAL: <i>Elizabeth, don't do anything…</i>

33:18.290 --> 33:19.291
(BEEPS)

33:21.210 --> 33:23.253
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.088
Um, are you staying at the hotel?

33:28.759 --> 33:30.344
I'm… Yeah.

33:30.594 --> 33:32.846
Yeah, I'm staying. You?

33:32.930 --> 33:35.516
No. Just getting a drink. Hmm.

33:37.017 --> 33:38.310
Are you in a rush?

33:39.937 --> 33:41.730
-What?
-Well, sit with me.

33:41.813 --> 33:42.898
Have a drink.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.027
Um…

33:47.653 --> 33:48.820
Maybe later?

33:48.904 --> 33:50.113
Why not now?

33:50.739 --> 33:52.032
I have a meeting.

33:52.115 --> 33:55.661
How about you give me your phone
and I'll give you my number

33:55.744 --> 33:57.371
and you call me in a half hour?

33:57.913 --> 33:58.997
Okay.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.418
-Ma'am, your check.
-Oh, thank you.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.548
Thanks.

34:07.881 --> 34:09.091
(TYPING)

34:11.176 --> 34:12.803
-All right.
-Thanks.

34:13.011 --> 34:15.013
-Promise to call?
-Promise.

34:37.202 --> 34:39.288
Neal, that's him.
Did you get a hold of Peter?

34:39.371 --> 34:40.747
No. Voicemail.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.416
Wait here.
I need to see where they're going.

34:42.499 --> 34:43.792
Oh, no, I'm coming.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.191
NEAL: All right, tell me
everything that happened.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.109
Well, okay, I flirted with him.

35:09.193 --> 35:10.986
He tried to flirt back,
but he was not very good at it.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.446
-Keep going.
-He seemed anxious to leave.

35:12.529 --> 35:15.657
He said maybe meet up in 30 minutes
and he put his number in my phone.

35:15.741 --> 35:17.743
He put his number in your phone?
Let me see it.

35:23.582 --> 35:25.000
What is that?

35:25.083 --> 35:27.002
Some kind of new microchip.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.921
All Peter told me
was that it's about security.

35:29.004 --> 35:32.049
I think we found
what he and Jill are looking for.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.467
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:35.093 --> 35:36.970
Shouldn't he be waiting for us?

35:37.387 --> 35:39.932
Like you said, we're early.
He's playing it cool.

35:43.018 --> 35:44.937
Honey, I told you, it's the wrong room.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.980
Hey, I saw you the other day.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.566
Taking pictures of us.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.485
(CHUCKLES) We're honeymooners.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.195
We thought this was our room,
but our key doesn't work,

35:53.278 --> 35:54.363
so I guess it isn't.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.032
There's only one room on this end.

35:57.115 --> 35:59.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't
want any trouble.

35:59.493 --> 36:00.869
We'll just be leaving, all right?

36:01.078 --> 36:02.246
What's in the bag?

36:03.747 --> 36:05.749
Nothing. Clothes.

36:07.084 --> 36:08.293
Open it.

36:09.461 --> 36:13.006
Open it, or you go
from honeymooner to widow.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.014
MAN: <i>Buyers or feds?</i>

36:21.098 --> 36:23.392
Cash says that you're either one
or the other.

36:23.475 --> 36:24.685
Third option.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.979
We're newlyweds
who don't believe in credit cards.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.647
He's an old-fashioned kind of guy.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.065
That I am.

36:30.274 --> 36:33.986
I don't know who he is, but she's a buyer.

36:34.611 --> 36:37.239
The deal was supposed to go down today.
Right now.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.866
The chip!

36:39.408 --> 36:41.285
I hid it on a woman downstairs.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.411
What woman?

36:42.494 --> 36:44.162
Wait. We're both buyers.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.832
Iranian interests.

36:47.124 --> 36:50.002
Well, at least I was until this morning.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.713
North Korea came calling.

36:54.256 --> 36:57.050
Our partnership wasn't gonna
make it past the parking garage.

36:57.134 --> 36:58.468
Son of a bitch.

36:58.552 --> 37:03.432
Their country would be very grateful
if the two of you joined our team.

37:03.932 --> 37:05.392
Extremely grateful.

37:05.475 --> 37:07.060
Look, kill the both of them.

37:07.477 --> 37:10.189
You can take the money.
I'll cut you in on my half of the chip.

37:10.272 --> 37:11.940
Just untie me.

37:12.024 --> 37:13.025
All right, you have to go downstairs.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.902
I have the chip. I'm going in.

37:14.985 --> 37:15.986
Give it to me. I'll take it in.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.947
Are you gonna help me get in there,
or am I gonna have to knock?

37:19.031 --> 37:20.073
Let's discuss this.

37:20.157 --> 37:22.534
I don't know who you're working for
or what they're paying you,

37:22.618 --> 37:24.328
but the North Koreans will beat it.

37:24.411 --> 37:27.289
-They can't even feed their own people.
-Shut up.

37:27.998 --> 37:29.875
What are you looking for, newlywed?

37:31.710 --> 37:32.878
All right.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.588
-You never saw this.
-What is that?

37:34.671 --> 37:36.340
It's something Mozzie and I made.

37:36.423 --> 37:38.675
Now go in there like you own the place.

37:38.759 --> 37:41.261
Show them the chip,
but keep it away from them.

37:44.473 --> 37:46.058
Okay, try to buy me 30 seconds.

37:49.436 --> 37:50.729
Careful.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.898
MAN: I asked you a question, newlywed.

37:52.981 --> 37:54.066
I've got what you want.

37:54.149 --> 37:56.818
Hon, get out of here now.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.040
That's her.

38:10.123 --> 38:12.292
That's the woman I stashed the chip on.

38:12.543 --> 38:14.253
He's right.

38:14.336 --> 38:15.712
It's in here.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.256
It's… I have it.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.883
It's… It's…

38:21.385 --> 38:23.720
It's right here. It's in the phone case.

38:24.805 --> 38:25.806
PETER: Hey!

38:34.231 --> 38:35.440
JONES: FBI.

38:38.277 --> 38:41.947
That was incredible.
But don't do anything like that again.

38:42.447 --> 38:44.199
I don't know if I can promise that.

38:44.283 --> 38:46.618
All right, we got two men down.

38:47.286 --> 38:48.996
Another typical day at White Collar.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.714
Well, I fulfilled
one of my fondest dreams.

38:58.797 --> 39:00.591
-Yeah, what's that?
-Working with you.

39:00.674 --> 39:02.217
-Oh.
-It was fun.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.720
We did talk about that at Quantico a lot.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.471
It lived up to expectations.

39:06.805 --> 39:08.557
But you had bigger dreams back then.

39:09.016 --> 39:11.101
-Washington.
-Soon?

39:12.269 --> 39:14.563
Once I've tied up all the loose ends here.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.023
Yeah.

39:16.106 --> 39:19.443
I can't just bring anyone in
to be Neal's handler.

39:20.068 --> 39:21.570
I gotta make sure they're up to the task.

39:21.653 --> 39:22.988
-Peter.
-What?

39:23.780 --> 39:25.782
-There'll always be loose ends.
-(CHUCKLES)

39:26.867 --> 39:29.119
Yeah, and there's one you might
be able to help me with.

39:31.163 --> 39:35.167
This one is a cold case
that has been gnawing at me for 20 years.

39:37.503 --> 39:38.962
Why California?

39:39.546 --> 39:41.048
You were top in our class.

39:41.131 --> 39:43.050
You could have had
any assignment you wanted.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.468
I took an assignment.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.221
First female SSG agent on the West Coast.

39:47.304 --> 39:49.681
-How could I turn that down?
-I wouldn't have stopped you.

39:50.516 --> 39:52.935
You wanted New York. DC.
That was your dream.

39:53.018 --> 39:54.978
(SIGHS) You ran.

39:56.647 --> 39:58.065
You didn't chase after me.

39:59.942 --> 40:01.652
You would have just run faster.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.490
You're right. I would have.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.911
At least this way
we can remember Quantico

40:10.994 --> 40:12.246
as the beautiful thing it was.

40:12.996 --> 40:13.997
Let's do that.

40:22.589 --> 40:24.049
Where you headed?

40:24.132 --> 40:26.260
Off to Miami. Another case.

40:26.677 --> 40:30.138
Well, I hope another case
brings you to New York again.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.975
Yeah, maybe I'll bring my El with me.

40:33.058 --> 40:35.227
-Male edition.
-Good luck finding one.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.645
She's one in a million.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.439
Don't be afraid to talk to her, Peter.

40:39.523 --> 40:40.607
About anything.

40:54.413 --> 40:56.832
PETER: I should have talked to you
about this a long time ago,

40:56.915 --> 40:59.209
but I can't stop thinking about him.

40:59.293 --> 41:02.087
I can't shake the feeling
that if I hadn't become ASAC

41:02.171 --> 41:04.089
he'd still be alive.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.675
NEAL: Just trust me, okay?

41:06.758 --> 41:08.177
-REBECCA: Can I open my eyes?
-No, you can't.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.970
Step down. Curb. Curb.

41:10.179 --> 41:11.513
There you go.

41:11.597 --> 41:13.765
It's not that big of a curb.

41:13.849 --> 41:16.351
I don't like surprises.
They never turn out good.

41:16.435 --> 41:17.853
All right, we're almost there.

41:17.936 --> 41:20.606
You know, you should know that
walking the streets of New York blind

41:20.689 --> 41:22.649
is a recurring nightmare of mine.

41:22.733 --> 41:24.109
You can open your eyes.

41:28.363 --> 41:30.782
REBECCA: It's the window from the codex.

41:33.243 --> 41:34.995
How did you ever find it?

41:35.454 --> 41:38.040
NEAL: Agent Gruetzner used
some of his underworld contacts.

41:40.042 --> 41:41.460
It's beautiful.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.089
-Not professional.
-No.

41:47.758 --> 41:49.051
Not professional at all.
