WEBVTT

00:01.413 --> 00:06.067
>> Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER": THE POWERFUL

00:06.102 --> 00:09.205
COOKOUT ALLIANCE WAS SECRETLY
RUNNING THE GAME.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.481
>> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN
THERE BE ANY WHIFF OF AN IDEA

00:13.516 --> 00:15.689
THAT MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT ARE
WORKING TOGETHER.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.205
>> Announcer: BUT WHEN SARAH
BETH WON POWER...

00:17.240 --> 00:18.757
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
SARAH BETH.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.481
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:21.516 --> 00:22.724
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:22.757 --> 00:26.896
>> Announcer: ...THE COOKOUT
SCRAMBLED TO KEEP THEIR ALLIANCE

00:26.931 --> 00:27.516
SAFE.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.448
>> MY MENTAL STATE IS LOW.

00:29.481 --> 00:32.758
>> IF YOU BLOW A GASKET THIS IS
NOT THE WEEK.

00:32.792 --> 00:33.965
>> I KNOW.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.689
>> Announcer: SARAH BETH'S
ALLY KYLAND STEERED HER TOWARD A

00:37.723 --> 00:38.930
TARGET OUTSIDE THE 6.

00:38.965 --> 00:43.723
>> I LOOK AT DEREK X. IN TERMS
OF HIS THREAT LEVEL TO YOU AND

00:43.758 --> 00:45.310
I, THE HIGHEST, MOST IMMINENT.

00:45.344 --> 00:48.137
IDEALLY, I CAN CONVINCE SARAH
BETH TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST

00:48.171 --> 00:50.310
THREAT TO THE COOKOUT, DEREK X.

00:50.344 --> 00:55.033
>> Announcer: AND A BACKDOOR
PLAN WAS PUT INTO MOTION.

00:55.067 --> 00:59.448
>> AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T WIN THE
VETO, HE'S ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:59.481 --> 00:59.758
BACKDOOR.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.000
>> YEAH.

01:01.033 --> 01:02.862
>> Announcer: AND ONCE AGAIN,
TWO PAWNS FOUND THEMSELVES ON

01:02.896 --> 01:03.930
THE BLOCK.

01:03.965 --> 01:08.275
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, DEREK
F., AND YOU, CLAIRE.

01:08.310 --> 01:12.067
>> Announcer: THE HIGH ROLLERS
ROOM WAS BACK OPEN, AND UNAWARE

01:12.102 --> 01:16.551
HE WAS IN DANGER, DEREK X. CHOSE
NOT TO PLAY, TURNING DOWN A SHOT

01:16.585 --> 01:17.343
AT SAFETY.

01:17.379 --> 01:19.516
>> I AM NOT PLAYING THE
ROULETTE.

01:19.551 --> 01:23.861
I'M GOING TO KEEP SAVING AND
WE'RE GOING FOR THAT COIN OF

01:23.896 --> 01:25.033
DESTINY.

01:25.067 --> 01:29.033
>> Announcer: LEAVING ALYSSA
AS THE ONLY ONE TO SPEND HER

01:29.067 --> 01:30.310
B.B. BUCKS.

01:30.343 --> 01:33.378
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND
PLAY CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

01:33.412 --> 01:35.723
I WANT TO ENSURE MY SAFETY.

01:35.758 --> 01:39.965
OUT OF EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE,
SWRIEFER IS MY ONLY ALLY AND THE

01:40.000 --> 01:42.033
ONLY PERSON I COMPLETELY TRUST.

01:42.067 --> 01:44.723
>> Announcer: ALYSSA'S WIN
GAVE HER SAFETY AND THE RIGHT TO

01:44.758 --> 01:45.655
REMOVE A NOMINEE.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.551
>> YOU ARE SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.343
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE OFF
THE BLOCK?

01:49.378 --> 01:52.000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE DEREK
OFF THE BLOCK.

01:52.033 --> 01:55.861
>> Announcer: THEN, A FATEFUL
SPIN OF THE ROULETTE WHEEL CHOSE

01:55.896 --> 01:56.206
THE REPLACEMENT.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.275
>> MY GOD!

01:57.310 --> 01:58.826
>> OH, MY GOD!

01:58.861 --> 02:00.034
>> IS THAT "X"?

02:00.067 --> 02:01.206
>> GOD!

02:01.240 --> 02:04.412
>> Announcer: AND ALYSSA WAS
LEFT IN TEARS AS HER CLOSEST

02:04.448 --> 02:05.826
ALLY HIT THE BLOCK.

02:05.861 --> 02:08.723
>> XAVIER, YOU ARE NOW NOMINATED
FOR EVICTION.

02:08.758 --> 02:11.688
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT IN THE
NOMINATION CHAIR.

02:11.723 --> 02:14.620
>> Announcer: BUT SARAH BETH
HAD BIGGER PLANS.

02:14.655 --> 02:16.413
>> I'M SORRY, AMERICA.

02:16.448 --> 02:18.378
I'M SENDING YOUR BOY HOME.

02:18.413 --> 02:21.103
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, WHO
WILL WIN THE POWER OF VETO?

02:21.137 --> 02:25.481
AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE
CLAIRE OR XAVIER?

02:25.516 --> 02:29.413
AND IF SO, IS DEREK X.'S DESTINY
TO BE BACKDOORED?

02:29.448 --> 02:33.723
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:33.758 --> 02:36.793
>> OH, MY GOD.

02:36.826 --> 02:41.793
FINALLY, I'M LIKED.

02:45.826 --> 02:48.275
♪ ♪
>> THE CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE

02:48.310 --> 02:51.067
POWER HAS BEEN USED.

02:51.103 --> 02:53.793
CLAIRE AND XAVIER ARE NOW
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

02:53.826 --> 02:56.896
THIS CONCLUDING THE CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE MEETING.

02:56.930 --> 03:01.033
>> I FEEL REALLY BAD BECAUSE
IT'S LITERALLY MY FAULT THAT "X"

03:01.068 --> 03:02.205
IS UP THERE.

03:02.241 --> 03:05.723
SINCE I WON THE CHOPPING BLOCK
ROULETTE, I HAD TO SPIN A

03:05.758 --> 03:09.378
ROULETTE WHEEL TO RANDOMLY
SELECT A NEW HOUSEGUEST AS A

03:09.413 --> 03:10.205
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.550
AND THE BALL LANDS RIGHT ON
XAVIER.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.481
"X" IS SO AWESOME, AND HE'S
ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

03:18.516 --> 03:23.620
AND I PUT HIM ON THE BLOCK.

03:23.655 --> 03:27.550
IF "X" GOES HOME BECAUSE I PUT
HIM UP OVER ROULETTE BALL, THAT

03:27.586 --> 03:29.413
WOULD BE SO HEARTBREAKING.

03:29.448 --> 03:33.378
I FEEL SO BAD.

03:33.413 --> 03:37.550
>> I WAS WORKING HARD, HARD TO
POSITION MYSELF TO WHERE I

03:37.586 --> 03:41.793
WOULDN'T BE NOMINATED AT ALL
THIS ENTIRE SEASON.

03:41.826 --> 03:45.826
AND NOW, I GET NOMINATED BECAUSE
OF SOME STUPID POWER.

03:45.861 --> 03:48.965
AND WHO ROLLS THE BALL TO
NOMINATE ME?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.413
MY CLOSEST ALLY OUTSIDE OF THE
COOKOUT, ALYSSA.

03:53.448 --> 03:55.758
IT'S SUCH BAD LUCK THAT IT'S
ALMOST FUNNY.

03:55.793 --> 03:57.793
I FEEL SECURE IN THE COOKOUT.

03:57.826 --> 04:01.826
HOWEVER, MY BEST WAY TO ENSURE
MY SAFETY THIS WEEK IS TO WIN

04:01.861 --> 04:02.895
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

04:02.931 --> 04:04.481
SO IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.

04:04.516 --> 04:08.033
>> LOOK, I'M STILL ON THE BLOCK.

04:08.068 --> 04:13.033
BUT NOW I'M UP AGAINST "X," WHO
IS THIS ULTIMATE PHYSICAL

04:13.068 --> 04:13.655
SPECIMEN.

04:13.688 --> 04:14.171
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:14.205 --> 04:15.343
I STILL HAVE TO WIN.

04:15.378 --> 04:16.033
>> I'M SORRY.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.654
>> IT'S OKAY.

04:17.689 --> 04:19.481
>> THIS IS PERFECT.

04:19.516 --> 04:24.033
THE CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE
POWER IS FLUSHED OUT, SO I DON'T

04:24.067 --> 04:25.310
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

04:25.343 --> 04:28.343
PLUS THE BALL DIDN'T LAND ON
DEREK X., WHICH MEANS HE'S NOT

04:28.379 --> 04:33.757
GUARANTEED TO PLAY IN THE VETO,
AND MY BACKDOOR PLAN STILL MIGHT

04:33.793 --> 04:34.930
WORK.

04:34.965 --> 04:37.793
>> I DECIDED NOT TO PLAY
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE BECAUSE

04:37.826 --> 04:40.689
I THINK THAT I CAN TRUST S.B.

04:40.723 --> 04:43.413
THIS WEEK, SO I WOULD RATHER
SAVE MY MONEY.

04:43.447 --> 04:45.137
AND NOW THAT THE WHEEL HAS BEEN
SUN AND "X" HAS GONE UP, I'M

04:45.172 --> 04:48.413
SUPER RELIEVED IT WAS "X" AND
NOT ME.

04:48.447 --> 04:49.620
>> DOUBLE OUR NOTHING?

04:49.654 --> 04:51.343
>> PUSH YOUR BETS.

04:51.379 --> 04:54.826
>> DX!

04:54.862 --> 04:55.965
>> I'M SO SORRY.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.206
>> STOP, STOP.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.103
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

04:59.137 --> 05:01.379
YOU PUT A BALL ON A SPINNING
WHEEL.

05:01.413 --> 05:03.033
YOU HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.067
>> YEAH, BUT NOW IT'S MY FAULT
YOU'RE UP THERE.

05:05.103 --> 05:07.343
IT'S NO ONE ELSE'S FAULT BUT
MINE.

05:07.379 --> 05:10.930
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:10.964 --> 05:13.862
>> I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE IT.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.310
THE ONE OPPORTUNITY I COULD HAVE
PUT SOMEONE ON THE BLOCK, I PUT

05:16.343 --> 05:17.757
YOU UP?

05:17.793 --> 05:21.620
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.516
>> NO, IT'S NOT, "X."

05:24.550 --> 05:26.862
>> I STILL HAVE THE VETO
COMPETITION.

05:26.896 --> 05:29.310
I CAN GET MYSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

05:29.343 --> 05:33.516
AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I DON'T
WIN AND CLAIRE WINS, SHE COMES

05:33.550 --> 05:37.137
DOWN, AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN GO
UP NEXT TO ME WHO IS A BIGGER

05:37.172 --> 05:37.965
THREAT.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.481
THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF GAME
LEFT.

05:39.516 --> 05:40.550
>> IT JUST PISSES ME OFF.

05:40.586 --> 05:41.447
>> I KNOW.

05:41.481 --> 05:43.930
>> THAT WAS ONE THING WE COULD
BE SOLID.

05:43.965 --> 05:44.757
>> DON'T WORRY.

05:44.793 --> 05:45.379
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

05:45.413 --> 05:51.206
>> I NEED A TEQUILA SHOT.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.274
>> OH!

05:52.310 --> 05:54.206
WOW, WHAT A WHEEL SPIN.

05:54.240 --> 05:54.826
>> YEAH.

05:54.862 --> 05:56.723
I FEEL SO BAD.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.550
>> YEAH, IT SUCKS FOR "X" AND
ALYSSA.

06:00.586 --> 06:02.516
>> IT SUCKS FOR YOU.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.516
LIKE, YOU'RE ON THE BLOCK NOW.

06:04.550 --> 06:07.447
CLAIRE GENUINELY ISN'T MY
TARGET.

06:07.482 --> 06:08.689
MY SIGHTS ARE SET ON DEREK X.

06:08.723 --> 06:09.896
RIGHT NOW.

06:09.930 --> 06:13.826
BUT THE TWO OF THEM ARE REALLY
CLOSE, SO, UNFORTUNATELY, I

06:13.862 --> 06:15.413
CAN'T CLUE HER IN ON THAT.

06:15.447 --> 06:15.826
"X" IS UP.

06:15.862 --> 06:17.137
>> YEAH.

06:17.172 --> 06:19.447
>> WHICH IS BETTER THAN A LOT OF
THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.516
>> YEAH.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.240
>> BECAUSE I THINK HE IS A
BIGGER TARGET THAN YOU.

06:22.274 --> 06:25.067
>> YEAH.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.896
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
DONE WITH VETO?

06:26.930 --> 06:30.137
>> IT PUTS ME IN A REALLY TRICKY
SPOT.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.000
NOW I HAVE TO THINK THROUGH
THINGS AND TALK TO PEOPLE AND

06:33.033 --> 06:34.757
SEE WHERE EVERYONE'S HEAD IS AT.

06:34.793 --> 06:38.447
BUT I DON'T WANT-- I DON'T WANT
YOU TO GO HOME IS WHAT I'LL SAY.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.723
I DON'T.

06:39.757 --> 06:43.033
>> SARAH BETH IS TELLING ME THAT
SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO GO HOME

06:43.067 --> 06:43.723
THIS WEEK.

06:43.757 --> 06:45.413
AND I BELIEVE HER.

06:45.447 --> 06:49.103
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR
HER GAME TO SEND ME OUT.

06:49.137 --> 06:52.240
SO SHE MUST HAVE SOME OTHER
TARGET IN MIND.

06:52.274 --> 06:55.723
SO LET'S-- LET'S THINK ABOUT THE
THREE BIGGEST THREATS IN THE

06:55.757 --> 06:56.930
HOUSE.

06:56.965 --> 06:58.137
OKAY, "X."

06:58.172 --> 07:02.274
"X" WAS ON THE KINGS WITH HER,
AND I DON'T THINK THAT SARAH

07:02.310 --> 07:06.274
BETH WILL WANT "X" OUT AT THIS
POINT.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.516
KYLAND, THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.206
THEY'VE BEEN JOINED AT THE HIP.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.793
I DON'T THINK SARAH BETH IS
GOING AFTER KYLAND.

07:11.826 --> 07:14.067
>> ANY TIME YOU WANT TO TALK,
JUST COME AND GRAB ME.

07:14.103 --> 07:15.240
>> I WILL.

07:15.274 --> 07:19.723
>> THAT MEANS OUT OF ALL THE
MAJOR THREATS IN THIS HOUSE,

07:19.757 --> 07:30.793
DEREK X. IS PROBABLY HER
BACKDOOR OPTION.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.826
>> I'M SORRY, CLAIRE BEAR.

07:32.862 --> 07:38.240
>> IT'S FINE.

07:38.274 --> 07:41.481
THE ONLY THING IS I DON'T WANT
YOU TO GO HOME THIS WEEK.

07:41.516 --> 07:44.757
I SAID, OKAY.

07:44.793 --> 07:47.723
IT WAS LIKE, DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEAS WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DONE

07:47.757 --> 07:48.757
WITH VETO?

07:48.793 --> 07:51.310
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "I'M IN A HARD
SPOT RIGHT NOW."

07:51.343 --> 07:53.103
>> SHE SAID THAT.

07:53.137 --> 07:57.793
>> SO I THINK THAT THEY WANTED
US UP.

07:57.826 --> 08:00.689
>> BUT THE ROULETTE DIDN'T GO
THAT WAY?

08:00.723 --> 08:05.757
>> NO, THAT'S THE CALCULATION.

08:05.793 --> 08:09.930
>> OH, MY GOSH.

08:09.964 --> 08:11.206
OH!

08:11.240 --> 08:13.206
CLAIRE'S THEORIZING THAT SARAH
BETH IS COMING FOR US, AND RIGHT

08:13.240 --> 08:15.137
NOW, I THINK SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

08:15.172 --> 08:18.274
BUT BETWEEN ME AND CLAIRE I
THINK I'M THE TARGET, BUT I'M

08:18.310 --> 08:19.550
REALLY NOT SURE.

08:19.586 --> 08:25.274
I NEED TO TALK TO S.B., AND FIND
OUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.516
>> HI.

08:26.550 --> 08:30.516
>> RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO MAKE
SURE WE DON'T ANTAGONIZE S.B.

08:30.550 --> 08:31.379
>> I KNOW.

08:31.413 --> 08:34.861
>> MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOOK MAD.

08:34.895 --> 08:42.240
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT VETO.

08:52.758 --> 08:56.136
>> HEARING THAT DEREK X. COULD
BE THE REPLACEMENT NOMINEE IS

08:56.172 --> 09:00.551
VERY UPSETTING FOR ME BECAUSE I
KNOW IF HE TOUCHES THAT BLOCK,

09:00.586 --> 09:02.274
THE COOKOUT IS NOT SAVING HIM.

09:02.309 --> 09:06.136
I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE DEREK X.

09:06.172 --> 09:08.861
HOPEFULLY, DEREK X. GETS PICKED
AND WINS THE VETO, AND THIS

09:08.895 --> 09:14.000
WON'T EVEN BE A CONCERN.

09:14.033 --> 09:14.379
AM
>> I REALLY WISH I NEVER PLAYED.

09:23.033 --> 09:25.481
I REALLY WISH--
>> I MEAN OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE.

09:25.517 --> 09:28.861
>> I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TALK
TO SARAH BETH, SINCE I JUST

09:28.895 --> 09:33.274
MESSED UP HER NOMINATIONS WITH
THE CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE AND

09:33.309 --> 09:37.895
XAVIER IS ON THE BLOCK, AND I
WANT TO SEE WHAT SHE'S THINKING

09:37.931 --> 09:39.688
WITH THE VETO COMPETITION.

09:39.724 --> 09:40.758
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

09:40.793 --> 09:43.000
>> I NEVER INTENDED FOR CLAIRE
TO GO HOME.

09:43.033 --> 09:44.379
AND I DON'T WANT "X" TO GO HOME.

09:44.413 --> 09:50.826
I FEEL LIKE I CAN TELL YOU, AND
IT HAS TO SAY, I'M THINKING IF

09:50.861 --> 09:55.136
"X" COMES DOWN, I WILL PUT D"X"
UP.

09:55.172 --> 09:58.067
>> I'M ON BOARD WITH THAT.

09:58.102 --> 09:59.586
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD HAVE
DONE.

09:59.620 --> 10:00.895
>> I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
SUSPICIOUS.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.000
>> I'M SO EXCITED WHEN SARAH
BETH TELLS ME SHE'S BEEN

10:02.033 --> 10:03.067
TARGETING DEREK X.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.793
I WANTED TO DO THAT SINCE HE
BACKDOORED CHRISTIAN.

10:05.826 --> 10:09.688
NOW I WANT TO BE PICKED FOR THE
COMPETITION EVEN MORE SO, SO I

10:09.724 --> 10:12.413
