WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.383
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.521 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.942
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.081 --> 00:14.876
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.015 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.918
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.575 --> 00:25.956
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.095 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.964
Just to get up that hill

00:34.103 --> 00:36.519
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.657 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.593
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.731 --> 00:43.319
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.115
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.253 --> 00:49.083
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.221 --> 00:53.674
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.812 --> 00:56.539
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.677 --> 00:59.921
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:00.060 --> 01:05.789
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:25.602 --> 01:26.879
Bad day, huh?

01:27.017 --> 01:28.467
What makes you say that?

01:30.780 --> 01:32.713
Oh, just a wild guess.

01:33.921 --> 01:35.233
You wanna
tell me about it?

01:35.371 --> 01:36.717
No.

01:36.855 --> 01:38.028
Oh, come on, George.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.203
Talking about it
will make you feel better.

01:40.341 --> 01:41.860
No, I won't, 'cause
if I tell you about it,

01:41.998 --> 01:43.275
I can't help
overhearing myself

01:43.413 --> 01:44.828
and I don't wanna
hear about it again.

01:46.934 --> 01:48.004
Then tell it to me fast.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.351
Then you won't have time
to listen to yourself.

01:50.489 --> 01:51.973
Okay, you asked for it.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.975
Two girls called in sick
from my Queens store,

01:54.114 --> 01:55.667
the transmission went out
on one of my vans,

01:55.805 --> 01:58.187
the cleaning machine up
in the Bronx store broke down,

01:58.325 --> 01:59.981
the income tax people
wanted to audit my books

02:00.120 --> 02:01.431
and the accountant
broke down,

02:01.569 --> 02:02.984
then I come home to a wife
who keeps pressuring me

02:03.123 --> 02:04.296
to hear the whole story.

02:05.987 --> 02:07.610
I think you could
use a drink.

02:08.404 --> 02:10.164
Let Florence get it.

02:10.302 --> 02:11.579
She's not here.
It's her day off.

02:11.717 --> 02:14.134
Oh! That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

02:15.756 --> 02:18.276
What are we having for dinner?
Guess.

02:18.414 --> 02:20.968
Guess? Weezy, look,
I ain't in the mood
for no 20 questions.

02:21.106 --> 02:22.452
Just tell me
what we're having.

02:22.590 --> 02:25.145
I said guest. Dinner guest.

02:25.283 --> 02:26.560
Dinner guest?

02:26.698 --> 02:28.217
How come I don't know
nothing about this?

02:28.355 --> 02:29.701
I didn't know
anything about it either

02:29.839 --> 02:31.081
till your mother
came over.

02:31.220 --> 02:32.255
Oh. Mama's here?

02:33.083 --> 02:34.809
Since 10:00 this morning.

02:35.810 --> 02:38.088
Do you wanna
hear about my day?

02:40.021 --> 02:41.091
No, no, no, no.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.300
How's she feeling?

02:42.438 --> 02:43.680
Still complaining.

02:43.818 --> 02:44.819
Oh, about her
broken ankle?

02:44.957 --> 02:46.718
No, about me.

02:46.856 --> 02:48.582
She may be hobbling
around on a cane,

02:48.720 --> 02:51.585
but her mouth
is still going full speed.

02:51.723 --> 02:52.931
Where is she?

02:53.069 --> 02:54.174
In the kitchen.

02:54.312 --> 02:55.865
She invited
a friend for dinner

02:56.003 --> 02:58.764
and she wants to make sure
everything's perfect.

02:58.902 --> 03:00.214
A friend?
What friend?

03:00.352 --> 03:02.734
I don't know. Your mother
wants to surprise us.

03:02.872 --> 03:05.875
All she said was
it's an old friend
from out of town.

03:06.876 --> 03:09.568
Oh, no. I bet you
it's that Rose Filbert.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.467
Rose Filbert?

03:11.605 --> 03:13.469
Yeah. Her and Mom used
to do everything together

03:13.607 --> 03:15.471
till Rose moved to Atlanta.

03:15.609 --> 03:17.680
I wish they'd
done that together too.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.615
I never could stand
that Rose Filbert.

03:21.753 --> 03:23.651
Why not?

03:23.789 --> 03:25.619
Well, when I was a kid,
she always used to run up
and grab my cheeks like this

03:25.757 --> 03:27.207
and say, "How you doing,
Georgie Porgie?"

03:28.208 --> 03:29.554
Ow! That hurts!

03:29.692 --> 03:31.556
I know it hurts!
That's why I didn't like her.

03:33.937 --> 03:36.319
Look, Weezy, I'm gonna
sack out right after dinner

03:36.457 --> 03:37.941
so I'm gonna leave it up
to you to entertain Mom

03:38.079 --> 03:39.598
and her cheek-pinching friend.

03:39.736 --> 03:41.807
Oh, no, you don't, George!

03:41.945 --> 03:45.397
It's your mother,
your mother's friend.
You entertain them!

03:45.535 --> 03:47.744
Oh, come on, Weezy.
I'm too tired.

03:47.882 --> 03:50.368
There's no way in the world
I could be my normal,
charming self.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.611
Well, don't tell me.

03:52.749 --> 03:54.372
Tell it to your mother.

03:55.131 --> 03:56.339
Okay, I will.

03:58.479 --> 04:01.758
Oh, Mother Jefferson,
the broccoli is burning!

04:01.896 --> 04:02.966
Why didn't you call me?

04:03.104 --> 04:04.761
I've eaten here before.

04:04.899 --> 04:06.556
I figured
that's the way you cook.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.769
Hiya, Mama!

04:13.598 --> 04:15.324
Oh, thank you, George.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.605
I can't taste the vodka.

04:20.743 --> 04:22.123
That's 'cause it's Scotch.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.367
George, you know I don't like
Scotch. I like bloody marys.

04:24.505 --> 04:25.506
Sorry, Mama.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.921
Never mind.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.027
Since it's here,
I'll struggle through it.

04:29.993 --> 04:31.374
Uh, look, Mom.

04:31.512 --> 04:32.720
I hope you won't feel bad

04:32.858 --> 04:34.895
if I won't be able
to entertain you
and Rose tonight.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.172
Rose?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.449
Yeah, Rose Filbert.

04:37.587 --> 04:41.039
Rose Filbert's coming here?
Oh, that's wonderful!

04:41.177 --> 04:42.972
Look, Mama, we ain't
got time for no games.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.492
We know you invited
Rose Filbert here
for dinner tonight.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.700
I did not.

04:46.838 --> 04:48.046
Then who is it?

04:48.184 --> 04:50.290
That's a secret.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.052
Mama, you know
I don't like secrets.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.536
Now, if somebody's coming here
to eat up my food,

04:55.674 --> 04:56.744
I'd like to know
who it is.

04:56.882 --> 04:58.470
Well, if you must know.

04:58.608 --> 05:00.610
You remember the summer
you turned 17?

05:00.748 --> 05:01.784
Yeah.

05:01.922 --> 05:02.957
Remember the picture

05:03.095 --> 05:05.063
you kept hidden
in your bottom drawer?

05:05.753 --> 05:07.168
Picture...

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
Oh! Oh, yeah.
That wasn't my picture, Mama.

05:09.447 --> 05:10.931
I was just holding that
for a friend.

05:11.069 --> 05:12.312
What picture
are you talking about?

05:12.450 --> 05:14.244
Well, what picture
are you talking about?

05:14.383 --> 05:15.660
Mother Jefferson...

05:17.903 --> 05:21.286
What has all this got to do
with your secret guest?

05:21.424 --> 05:23.909
I'll give you
another clue, George.

05:24.047 --> 05:25.117
Puddin'.

05:25.255 --> 05:26.326
Puddin'?

05:26.464 --> 05:28.638
You mean you invited
Harriet Johnson over here?

05:28.776 --> 05:31.814
Harriet was the nicest girl
George ever dated.

05:34.782 --> 05:36.508
I can't remember the
last time I saw Harriet.

05:37.371 --> 05:41.513
That was October 21, 1945.

05:41.651 --> 05:43.446
That's the day
she dropped you.

05:43.584 --> 05:44.999
Dropped me?
She didn't drop me.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.208
I dropped her!

05:48.071 --> 05:49.452
If she jilted George,

05:49.590 --> 05:51.558
why did you invite her
here for dinner?

05:51.696 --> 05:54.975
I want her to see
what she lost

05:55.113 --> 05:57.046
when she dropped George.

06:00.429 --> 06:03.639
I can think of one thing
she didn't lose.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.815
Mama, when is Harriet
supposed to get here?

06:07.953 --> 06:09.058
In a little while.

06:09.196 --> 06:11.060
She's having her hair done.

06:11.198 --> 06:12.751
Oh, Louise, that reminds me.

06:12.889 --> 06:16.479
That'll give you
just enough time to
put something nice on.

06:17.963 --> 06:20.034
I've got something nice on.

06:20.725 --> 06:21.898
Underneath?

06:23.590 --> 06:25.281
Weezy, you look just fine.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.663
Love must be blind.

06:32.668 --> 06:34.152
What's Harriet
been up to?

06:34.290 --> 06:36.430
Well, she's been living
in Chicago,

06:36.568 --> 06:38.881
but she just got a divorce.

06:39.019 --> 06:41.124
Did you mention
what I've been doing?

06:41.262 --> 06:45.543
Yes, I told her you were
still married to Louise.

06:49.063 --> 06:50.720
Well, what did she say
about that?

06:50.858 --> 06:53.067
I couldn't understand
for the crying.

06:54.724 --> 06:55.725
It broke her up, huh?

06:56.243 --> 06:57.658
It was me crying.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.903
Weezy! How about a drink?

07:10.809 --> 07:12.086
What do you
want me to make?

07:12.224 --> 07:13.916
Make her disappear!

07:14.710 --> 07:15.952
Of all the nerve!

07:16.090 --> 07:18.714
Asking Harriet Johnson
to come here for dinner.

07:18.852 --> 07:21.613
Poor Harriet.
I wonder what she's
been up to these days.

07:21.751 --> 07:24.616
Going around visiting
old boyfriends.

07:24.754 --> 07:27.136
Look, Weezy, what happened
between me and Harriet

07:27.274 --> 07:28.758
was a long time ago

07:28.896 --> 07:30.622
and I ain't excited
about seeing her again.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.900
Okay, then call her up
and cancel.

07:33.038 --> 07:35.247
I can't do that!
Why not?

07:35.385 --> 07:37.664
Well... I don't know
what hairdresser she's at.

07:38.561 --> 07:39.769
And besides,
you can see

07:39.907 --> 07:41.944
how much Mama's
looking forward to
seeing her again.

07:42.082 --> 07:43.186
Where are you going?

07:43.324 --> 07:45.361
To get cleaned up.
George!

07:45.499 --> 07:46.535
Oh, while I'm
doing that, Weezy,

07:46.673 --> 07:47.777
why don't you get
our best china?

07:47.915 --> 07:49.330
Our best china?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.194
What's wrong with
our everyday dishes?

07:51.332 --> 07:53.162
Harriet don't come here
every day.

07:55.544 --> 07:57.200
Yeah, that's true.

07:57.338 --> 07:58.719
Where'd you put
my alligator shoes?

08:14.701 --> 08:15.805
George?

08:15.943 --> 08:17.427
Ah, Weez!
I've been looking
all over for you.

08:18.187 --> 08:19.153
How's dinner coming?

08:19.291 --> 08:20.603
Fine.
Ah.

08:21.190 --> 08:22.502
What's that smell?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.573
Huh? Oh.

08:24.711 --> 08:26.540
I accidentally spilled
a bottle of cologne.

08:28.818 --> 08:31.165
What did you do,
wipe it up with your face?

08:32.753 --> 08:34.617
Weezy, now why are you
acting this way?

08:34.755 --> 08:36.895
You're the one
who's acting crazy.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.415
Twenty minutes ago,
all you wanted to do
was sleep.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.244
Now you're running around

08:41.382 --> 08:43.281
like you're expecting
the Queen of England!

08:43.419 --> 08:44.489
Uh-oh, look,
don't tell me

08:44.627 --> 08:46.215
you're jealous
after all these years.

08:46.353 --> 08:49.390
How would you like
it if I kept talking
about my first love?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.289
I wouldn't mind a bit.

08:51.876 --> 08:53.049
You wouldn't?

08:53.187 --> 08:54.810
No, you can talk about me
as much as you want.

08:58.503 --> 09:01.333
And what makes you think
you were my first love?

09:01.471 --> 09:02.576
Well, I was,
wasn't I?

09:02.714 --> 09:04.026
I mean, your
real first love.

09:04.371 --> 09:05.372
No.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.650
I had a picture
hidden in my drawer too.

09:08.306 --> 09:09.272
You did?

09:09.410 --> 09:10.653
Yep.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.206
Who was it?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.139
He was so handsome

09:14.277 --> 09:16.176
and, boy, did I love him.

09:16.314 --> 09:18.558
You loved him
and you kept it a secret
from me all this time?

09:18.696 --> 09:20.111
You better tell me
who it was.

09:21.319 --> 09:22.389
It was Nat.

09:22.527 --> 09:24.149
Nat. I should have known.

09:25.392 --> 09:26.531
Nat who?

09:28.982 --> 09:30.362
Nat King Cole.

09:31.260 --> 09:32.848
Nat King...

09:32.986 --> 09:34.194
Oh!

09:34.332 --> 09:36.645
See? Who's jealous now?

09:36.783 --> 09:38.923
Ah, no, you see,
I'm just acting jealous

09:39.061 --> 09:41.788
to show you how silly it looks
if you got jealous.

09:41.926 --> 09:43.617
So why don't we just
forget the whole thing?

09:45.792 --> 09:46.965
Er, George...

09:50.003 --> 09:52.350
How close were you
and Harriet Johnson?

09:52.488 --> 09:54.455
Weezy, look,
you're my only girl

09:54.594 --> 09:56.457
and you've always been,
since the first day we met.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.838
Well, that's nice to hear.

09:59.288 --> 10:02.084
I mean, you know,
Harriet's just another girl.

10:02.222 --> 10:04.604
I mean, she wasn't even
that good-looking.

10:04.742 --> 10:06.398
She's probably all fat,
old and wrinkled by now.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.333
You know how women
age quicker than men.

10:13.854 --> 10:14.959
Puddin'!

10:29.145 --> 10:30.940
That was a
wonderful dinner.

10:31.078 --> 10:32.286
Beautifully cooked.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.150
Oh, thank you.

10:39.984 --> 10:43.263
And I can't get over
how good you look,
Mrs. Jefferson.

10:43.401 --> 10:46.369
You haven't changed a bit
after all these years.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.199
Has she, Louise?

10:48.337 --> 10:50.511
No. She never changes.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.653
How about some more
champagne, Harriet?

10:53.791 --> 10:54.792
Thank you.

10:56.345 --> 10:57.726
I would like
some too, George.

10:57.864 --> 10:58.934
Sure, Weez.

11:09.116 --> 11:11.118
George, you're really
living high on the hog.

11:11.256 --> 11:13.707
That's right. I brings home
the bacon, don't I, Weezy?

11:14.950 --> 11:17.228
And his mother
brings home the sugar.

11:18.505 --> 11:19.679
You're sweet.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.683
Boy, George, you are
doing it in style.

11:23.821 --> 11:26.582
A fine apartment,
$20 champagne...

11:26.720 --> 11:27.997
How'd you know
how much it cost?

11:28.135 --> 11:29.827
Well, see, it's right here
on the price tag.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.621
Oh, that Ralph.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.727
Did he leave the
price tag on it again?

11:33.865 --> 11:37.869
Yes, I wonder
who made him do it.

11:38.007 --> 11:40.838
George, you've got gravy
running off your plate.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.771
That's right, I don't
even care if it gets
on the tablecloth,

11:42.909 --> 11:44.565
'cause I can clean it
at my own store.

11:48.259 --> 11:49.329
How about a toast?

11:49.467 --> 11:50.986
Oh, good idea.

11:51.124 --> 11:54.714
Ah, here's to the back seat
of Junior Wilson's De Soto.

12:00.892 --> 12:04.585
What happened in the back seat
of Junior Wilson's De Soto?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.277
Oh, that's where George
and I first kissed...

12:06.415 --> 12:07.588
Held hands.

12:09.073 --> 12:10.902
Oh, well, which
was it, George?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.386
Kissed or held hands?

12:12.524 --> 12:13.525
Both.
Well...

12:13.663 --> 12:14.837
Once we started kissing,

12:14.975 --> 12:17.771
I'd always have
to hold George's hands.

12:25.123 --> 12:26.469
Really?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.818
George, could I see you
in the kitchen, please?

12:29.956 --> 12:31.578
Not now, Weezy.
Now, George!

12:33.166 --> 12:34.719
I can't right now, Weezy.
I gotta answer the doorbell.

12:37.515 --> 12:39.551
Ah, Mr. J. I'm so
pleased to see you.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.105
I'm pleased
to see you too, Bentley.

12:41.243 --> 12:43.555
Oh, that's good,
because I've got
a bit of a problem.

12:43.693 --> 12:45.143
I'm entertaining
a lady friend tonight

12:45.281 --> 12:46.696
and I'm in need
of a wire whip.

12:47.283 --> 12:48.422
Wire whip?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.391
Bentley,
I'm surprised at you.

12:51.529 --> 12:53.289
Why? I do
all my own cooking.

12:53.427 --> 12:54.946
What's a wire whip
gotta do with cooking?

12:55.084 --> 12:56.292
Well, I'm separating
some eggs

12:56.430 --> 12:58.122
and I need a wire whip
to beat the whites.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.537
Oh!

12:59.675 --> 13:00.849
Well, you can have
anything you want

13:00.987 --> 13:02.264
if it's to beat the whites.

13:07.096 --> 13:10.617
Louise, Bentley wants to
borrow your wire whip.

13:10.755 --> 13:12.584
Oh, sure.
Hi, Mr. Bentley.

13:12.722 --> 13:15.277
Hello, Mrs. J.
And Mrs. Jefferson.

13:15.415 --> 13:16.588
And, uh...

13:16.726 --> 13:18.452
Oh. This is our next-door
neighbor, Bentley.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.144
Harry Bentley,
Miss Johnson.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.352
Hi.
Hello.

13:21.490 --> 13:24.044
You know, she was
George's first girlfriend.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.115
We met
in high school.

13:26.253 --> 13:28.359
Really? You two were
at school together?

13:28.497 --> 13:30.361
But Miss Johnson
looks so young.

13:30.499 --> 13:31.534
And you look so...

13:31.672 --> 13:32.777
So what?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.022
Dignified.
Oh.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.644
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Miss Johnson.

13:37.782 --> 13:39.715
Thank you. But call me
Harriet, please.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.476
Harriet. Now isn't that
an amazing coincidence?

13:42.614 --> 13:43.995
Coincidence?
Yes.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.618
You see, your name, Harriet,
is a variation of Henrietta.

13:46.756 --> 13:48.724
And Henrietta is the
feminine version of Henry.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.105
So?

13:50.243 --> 13:52.072
When I was born, my mother
wanted to name me Henry.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.454
She and my father
fought about it for weeks.

13:54.592 --> 13:56.283
Your father liked Harry?

13:56.421 --> 13:58.354
Uh, no. He liked
my brother Malcolm.

14:01.979 --> 14:02.980
LOUISE:
Uh...

14:05.879 --> 14:08.226
Come with me, Mr. Bentley.
I'll get your whip.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.607
Jolly good.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.369
Did that make sense?

14:13.507 --> 14:14.888
Only if you're English.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.411
All this champagne is
making me so sleepy, George.

14:20.549 --> 14:22.344
I think I'll go lie down.

14:22.482 --> 14:23.655
Okay, Mama.

14:24.725 --> 14:26.796
I'll just take this with me

14:26.935 --> 14:30.179
in case I can't sleep.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.011
Thank you.

14:34.149 --> 14:35.805
What's that string
around your finger?

14:35.944 --> 14:37.704
Oh, that's my
"Don't forget" string.

14:38.739 --> 14:40.017
To remind you
of something?

14:40.155 --> 14:42.398
Yes. Uh...

14:44.884 --> 14:48.232
Uh, to meet Charlotte
at the subway at 7:15.

14:48.370 --> 14:51.269
Oh, well, it's
a quarter of eight.

14:51.407 --> 14:52.892
Your string
must be slow.

14:53.478 --> 14:55.377
What? Oh, no!

14:56.240 --> 14:58.173
I hope she's still there.

14:58.311 --> 15:00.865
Oh, Mrs. J, would you
do me a big favor?

15:01.003 --> 15:02.832
You want me to
beat your whites?

15:02.971 --> 15:04.731
Ah, no. I have
a roast in the oven.

15:04.869 --> 15:06.940
Would you take it out
while I nip down and
pick up Charlotte?

15:07.078 --> 15:08.459
Oh, sure.
Bless you.

15:08.597 --> 15:10.426
A pleasure to meet you,
Henrietta.

15:11.738 --> 15:14.051
Uh, I'll be back
in a few minutes, George.

15:14.189 --> 15:15.466
Take your time, Weezy.

15:17.986 --> 15:19.090
I mean "Hurry back."

15:24.820 --> 15:26.926
Yeah, I always liked to
hear you laugh, Harriet.

15:27.064 --> 15:28.341
When me and you
was going out together,

15:28.479 --> 15:29.652
you always had
a lot to laugh at.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.309
You weren't
that bad, George.

15:33.311 --> 15:34.485
Say what?

15:34.623 --> 15:35.969
I'm just kidding.

15:36.107 --> 15:37.695
We had some good times,
didn't we?

15:37.833 --> 15:40.698
Yeah. You used to wear those
cute, fuzzy little sweaters.

15:40.836 --> 15:43.011
I guess it was
just puppy love.

15:43.149 --> 15:45.151
Yeah, I loved the way
you used to wag your tail.

15:50.639 --> 15:51.881
And I was so proud
of the way

15:52.020 --> 15:53.504
you'd always stand up
to those other guys

15:53.642 --> 15:54.746
and fight over me.

15:54.884 --> 15:56.231
Yeah, that's right.
I remember that.

15:56.369 --> 15:58.371
I used to always fight people
saying bad things to you.

15:58.509 --> 16:00.580
George, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

16:00.718 --> 16:02.685
Nobody ever said
bad things to me.

16:02.823 --> 16:05.481
I just used to tell you that
so you'd fight 'em for me.

16:05.619 --> 16:07.345
What? Why'd you do that?

16:07.483 --> 16:09.416
'Cause you were
so good at it.

16:09.554 --> 16:10.900
Yeah, I was,
wasn't I?

16:12.764 --> 16:15.077
I bet you're still
good at it, George.

16:15.215 --> 16:16.527
Well...

16:16.665 --> 16:18.943
I bet you're still good
at other things too, puddin'.

16:20.427 --> 16:22.050
Well, I ain't had
no complaints.

16:26.916 --> 16:28.435
I've thought a lot
about you lately.

16:28.573 --> 16:29.919
Oh, you have?

16:30.058 --> 16:32.439
Especially when
things got rough with
my old man in Chicago.

16:32.577 --> 16:34.752
Oh, yeah. Mama told me
you got divorced.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.754
Well, not exactly
divorced.

16:36.892 --> 16:38.031
Oh. Just separated?

16:38.169 --> 16:40.275
Yeah. Something
came between us.

16:40.413 --> 16:41.897
Oh, that's a shame.
What was it?

16:42.346 --> 16:43.416
His wife.

16:44.244 --> 16:45.418
His wife?

16:45.556 --> 16:47.868
Me and this dude had
an arrangement.

16:48.559 --> 16:50.112
Oh. Oh, an arrangement.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.355
Yeah, well, you did
the smart thing

16:51.493 --> 16:53.288
by leaving Chicago
and coming to New York.

16:53.426 --> 16:56.256
I'm so glad to know
you feel that way, George.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.362
Mmm.
Plan on staying, then?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.777
That depends.

17:00.122 --> 17:01.261
On what?

17:01.399 --> 17:02.883
How good
the prospects are.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.610
Oh, you mean...a job?

17:06.577 --> 17:08.544
Yeah, you might say that.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.753
Uh, well, as far
as I can see,

17:10.891 --> 17:12.479
you got very good prospects.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.827
Well, that's wonderful,
puddin'.

17:15.965 --> 17:17.967
Where you staying?
In a motel.

17:18.106 --> 17:20.108
But I just found
a great apartment.

17:20.246 --> 17:21.385
Oh, terrific.

17:21.523 --> 17:23.870
But it costs 500 bucks
just to move in.

17:24.008 --> 17:25.561
And I haven't
got that much.

17:25.699 --> 17:27.253
Oh. Well, how much
are you short?

17:27.391 --> 17:28.806
500 bucks.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.054
If only there was somebody

17:35.192 --> 17:37.090
with enough money
to take care of it.

17:37.884 --> 17:38.954
I know somebody.

17:39.368 --> 17:40.335
Who?

17:40.473 --> 17:41.612
Me.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.579
I'll give you the money
for the apartment.

17:43.717 --> 17:45.754
You mean you'll
take care of me, puddin'?

17:45.892 --> 17:48.343
Yeah. I mean, what else
is money for but friends?

17:48.481 --> 17:49.551
Oh, well.

17:49.689 --> 17:52.933
I didn't think you'd agree
so quickly, I must say.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.177
You're quite a guy,
George Jefferson.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.078
Here you go. $500.

17:59.216 --> 18:00.976
Thanks, puddin'.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.566
This will be a great
arrangement, believe me.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.223
I'll let you have
the key next week.

18:06.671 --> 18:07.845
Key? What key?

18:07.983 --> 18:09.743
Key to the apartment.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.607
Why would I want the key
to your apartment?

18:11.745 --> 18:14.403
What do you want to do,
climb through the window?

18:16.474 --> 18:18.269
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

18:18.407 --> 18:19.650
What are you
talking about?

18:19.788 --> 18:21.134
The arrangement, honey.

18:21.272 --> 18:22.722
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.034
It happens all the time.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.312
Look, if you're
talking about

18:26.450 --> 18:27.520
what I think
you're talking about,

18:27.658 --> 18:29.038
I don't want
to talk about it.

18:29.177 --> 18:30.695
But I thought
you wanted to do it.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.697
Are you crazy?
I'm a married man!

18:32.835 --> 18:34.492
It wouldn't interfere
with your marriage.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.529
What?
Come on, George.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.600
This is 1977.

18:38.738 --> 18:41.361
I know it is. And I'd like
to be around to see 1978.

18:50.301 --> 18:52.648
Which I won't
if Weezy finds out.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.444
George, everybody needs

18:55.582 --> 18:58.861
a little extracurricular
activity now and then.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.104
Well, I don't.

19:00.242 --> 19:02.244
Weezy gives me
all the curricular I need.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.977
But I thought we had
a good thing going.

19:11.115 --> 19:12.979
We did.
A long time ago.

19:13.117 --> 19:15.257
Well, what's wrong with
trying to relight the candle?

19:15.395 --> 19:17.121
'Cause somebody's
gonna get burnt.

19:19.019 --> 19:20.297
So just give me back
the check.

19:20.435 --> 19:21.505
Why?

19:21.643 --> 19:22.782
'Cause you got it
under false pretenses.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.542
Well, you gave it
under false pretenses.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.130
I thought you
were gonna keep me.

19:27.235 --> 19:28.891
I wouldn't keep you
if you was a foreign stamp.

19:29.029 --> 19:30.065
What?

19:33.724 --> 19:35.174
Give me the check.

19:35.312 --> 19:36.865
No. I'm keeping it.

19:37.003 --> 19:38.177
No way.
Yes!

19:39.592 --> 19:40.731
George!

19:42.526 --> 19:43.837
What's going on?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.287
Uh, nothing, Weezy.
Nothing.

19:45.425 --> 19:46.944
Well, what's
that check for?

19:47.082 --> 19:48.187
Check? What check?

19:48.911 --> 19:50.361
This check.

19:50.499 --> 19:52.674
GEORGE: Oh.
For $500?

19:52.812 --> 19:54.883
Oh, that check. Well,
that check is a check
that, uh...

19:55.021 --> 19:56.988
That's for
my mother, Louise.

19:57.126 --> 19:58.404
Your mother?

19:58.542 --> 20:01.786
George, why are you giving
Harriet's mother $500?

20:01.924 --> 20:03.478
Well, because, um...

20:03.616 --> 20:05.618
Because she needs
an operation.

20:05.756 --> 20:08.310
And George was kind enough
to lend us the money.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.623
Yeah, that's right, Weezy.
Her mother's real sick.

20:10.761 --> 20:13.108
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's wrong with her?

20:13.246 --> 20:14.558
Well, she...

20:14.696 --> 20:16.732
It's one of those sicknesses
they ain't discovered yet.

20:19.528 --> 20:21.427
Then why are
they operating?

20:21.565 --> 20:22.876
To see if they
can find it.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.261
Oh.

20:28.399 --> 20:30.021
And Harriet didn't
have enough money
for her poor mother.

20:30.159 --> 20:31.126
So I knew if
you knew about it,

20:31.264 --> 20:32.403
you'd want me
to help her.

20:32.541 --> 20:35.406
Oh, of course, Harriet.
Anything we can do.

20:35.544 --> 20:39.341
Well, I just hope this $500
is gonna be enough

20:39.479 --> 20:41.516
for my poor,
dear mama.

20:42.862 --> 20:45.416
Oh, Harriet,
I'm really sorry.

20:46.141 --> 20:47.970
Oh,
that's all right.

20:48.108 --> 20:49.662
If I don't have enough money

20:49.800 --> 20:51.388
and she doesn't
pull through...

20:51.526 --> 20:53.631
Oh, well, how much more
would you need?

20:53.769 --> 20:55.530
Weezy, she's got more
than enough already.

20:56.841 --> 20:58.291
Butt out, George.

20:58.429 --> 20:59.672
How much, Harriet?

20:59.810 --> 21:02.019
Oh, about...

21:02.640 --> 21:04.055
$800?

21:04.193 --> 21:05.402
$800!

21:06.265 --> 21:08.819
Oh, Harriet,
don't cry.

21:10.234 --> 21:12.236
George will give you
the rest of the money.

21:12.374 --> 21:13.720
Ain't your mother
got Medicare?

21:19.485 --> 21:21.832
George, just
write the check.

21:21.970 --> 21:25.870
Oh, I don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you, Louise.

21:26.008 --> 21:29.218
No, don't thank me.
Thank George.

21:30.530 --> 21:31.911
Here.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.671
Thank you, puddin'.

21:33.809 --> 21:35.294
Well, I better
go see Mama now

21:35.432 --> 21:37.157
and tell her
the good news.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.367
I hope everything turns out
all right, Harriet.

21:39.505 --> 21:40.747
Oh, it just did.

21:40.885 --> 21:41.955
Huh?

21:42.093 --> 21:45.304
I mean, you just made
Mama real happy.

21:45.856 --> 21:47.133
Bye, Louise.

21:47.271 --> 21:48.583
Bye, puddin'.

21:59.663 --> 22:01.975
Oh, George,
don't you feel good?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.770
Yeah, Weez,
I feel terrific.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.462
Who was that crying?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.153
I couldn't sleep.

22:07.291 --> 22:09.017
Oh, that was
Harriet crying.

22:09.155 --> 22:12.089
Why? Louise, what did
you say to her?

22:13.228 --> 22:14.471
Nothing.

22:14.609 --> 22:15.920
George just
gave her some money

22:16.058 --> 22:17.784
for her mother
to have an operation.

22:17.922 --> 22:19.303
Wasn't that
nice of him?

22:19.441 --> 22:22.824
Yes. Except
for one thing.

22:22.962 --> 22:25.792
Harriet's mother died
10 years ago.

22:27.553 --> 22:29.106
Are you sure?

22:29.244 --> 22:30.935
Of course I'm sure.

22:31.073 --> 22:33.041
I may not know who's alive,

22:33.179 --> 22:35.250
but I sure know who's dead!

22:43.292 --> 22:45.640
George, we are out $1,300.

22:45.778 --> 22:46.917
Don't worry
about it, Weezy.

22:47.055 --> 22:49.022
I can stop the $500 check
in the morning.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.335
But what about
that $800 check?

22:51.473 --> 22:53.751
Well, she's gonna have
a little trouble trying
to cash that one.

22:53.889 --> 22:55.063
Why?

22:55.201 --> 22:56.651
'Cause I signed it
"Puddin'."

23:04.659 --> 23:07.178
But how could Harriet
do such a thing?

23:07.316 --> 23:09.388
I don't know, Weez,
but she sure fooled you.

23:13.322 --> 23:15.083
You were fooled first.

23:15.221 --> 23:16.740
She didn't fool me,

23:16.878 --> 23:17.913
'cause I knew she
didn't want the money
for her mother.

23:19.052 --> 23:20.329
Oh?

23:21.503 --> 23:23.781
Then what did she
want the money for?

23:23.919 --> 23:26.025
Well... What do you say
we have a drink?

23:27.509 --> 23:30.754
George, what did Harriet
want that check for?

23:30.892 --> 23:31.858
What do you say
we go to bed?

23:31.996 --> 23:32.997
George!

23:35.310 --> 23:36.345
Okay, Weez.

23:38.831 --> 23:40.142
She wanted me
to keep her.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.042
Keep her what?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.563
Well, you know.

23:46.701 --> 23:48.012
She wanted to be
my mistress.

23:52.672 --> 23:53.777
You're kidding.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.331
I'm telling you the truth.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.781
She wanted to make
an arrangement.

23:58.506 --> 24:01.336
George, you want me to believe

24:01.474 --> 24:02.855
that that swinger...

24:02.993 --> 24:05.961
I'm telling you, Weezy,
she wanted me to keep her.

24:06.099 --> 24:09.068
Oh, you gotta come up with
something better than that.

24:11.001 --> 24:12.036
Why shouldn't she?

24:12.174 --> 24:14.176
I mean,
she's got good taste.

24:14.314 --> 24:15.971
See? That's why I don't like
to tell you the truth.

24:16.109 --> 24:17.352
'Cause you
never believe me.

24:40.237 --> 24:43.965
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
