00:02.668 --> 00:05.518
<i>the worst criminal
offenders are pursued</i>

00:05.519 --> 00:07.569
<i>by the detectives

00:07.604 --> 00:09.772
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:16.981 --> 00:18.781
- Where is he? Where is he?
Nyle, Nyle!

00:20.984 --> 00:22.285
Can you spell genius?

00:22.286 --> 00:24.954
- Well, I can spell
Nyle Brite, right?

00:24.955 --> 00:26.990
- Buddy, you killed it.
You absolutely killed it.

00:26.991 --> 00:28.291
Again, huh?

00:28.292 --> 00:30.193
Take a bow. Take a bow.
Get out there. Get out there.

00:30.194 --> 00:33.029
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Nyle Brite!</i>

00:40.237 --> 00:42.205
- I can't believe
you're blowing me off tonight.

00:42.206 --> 00:43.973
- I got invited
to a girlfriend's party.

00:43.974 --> 00:45.208
It's no big deal.

00:45.209 --> 00:47.777
- Come on, who is he-
a banker,

00:47.778 --> 00:49.813
hedge fund douche bag?

00:49.814 --> 00:51.748
- Nathan, come on,
jealousy's a turnoff.

00:51.749 --> 00:53.350
- Finals are next week.

00:53.351 --> 00:54.984
- And I'll ace them
just like I did midterms.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.186
And I'll call you tomorrow.

00:56.187 --> 00:57.454
- If you're dating other guys,

00:57.455 --> 01:00.323
I swear to God
I'll kill you.

01:05.328 --> 01:06.796
- Shoot for Mars,
settle for Venus.

01:06.797 --> 01:08.164
That's what I say
all the time, all right?

01:08.165 --> 01:10.333
To hell with the moon.
- The moon is for losers.

01:10.334 --> 01:14.437
- The moon is for losers.
The moon is a loser.

01:14.438 --> 01:16.272
Oh, God, you are
a very bad girl.

01:16.273 --> 01:18.608
- Oh, you have no idea.
- I'd like to.

01:18.609 --> 01:20.810
- Uh, she's been ridden
more than the "a" train.

01:20.811 --> 01:22.645
I got a newbie.

01:22.646 --> 01:25.014
- You, my man,
are the Houdini of hedonism.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.282
Come on, give it up.

01:26.283 --> 01:28.118
I love him.
I love him.

01:32.823 --> 01:34.858
- Ooh!

01:36.861 --> 01:38.795
Pink Peruvian.

01:44.001 --> 01:46.536
- Ah.

01:46.537 --> 01:48.304
You look amazing.

01:48.305 --> 01:49.906
- Oh, thanks.

01:49.907 --> 01:51.541
What kind of party is this?

01:51.542 --> 01:53.476
- The kind guys don't mention
to their wives.

01:53.477 --> 01:55.245
Sara, say hi to my friend-

01:55.246 --> 01:57.714
the most brilliant
fashion designer on earth.

01:57.715 --> 02:00.350
- You're supposed to say,
"in the universe."

Get everybody

02:11.796 --> 02:14.097
The party's over.
Get everyone out of my house.

02:14.098 --> 02:15.331
Get off of me.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.233
Get everybody
out of my house. Move.

02:17.234 --> 02:19.502
Hey, what are you deaf?
Get everyone out.

02:19.503 --> 02:21.104
Everyone,
get out of my house!

02:21.105 --> 02:22.172
Get out!
Out!

02:22.173 --> 02:24.407
- Okay, everybody,
party's over!

02:24.408 --> 02:27.510
- Get out.

02:27.511 --> 02:29.612
- Sorry, guys.

02:31.682 --> 02:34.584
- Go away, Nathan.
I'm not the mood.

02:39.857 --> 02:42.592
Nathan.

02:42.593 --> 02:43.626
- Hey.

02:43.627 --> 02:45.361
Hey, we need-
we need to talk.

02:45.362 --> 02:48.131
No anger, no judgment,
just raw, honest truth, okay?

02:48.132 --> 02:50.700
- You're high.
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:50.701 --> 02:53.570
Losing you was the worst thing
that ever happened to me, ever.

02:53.571 --> 02:56.206
- Go home to your wife.
- Come on, let me in.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.741
Come on!
- No, please! Stop! Aah!

03:11.655 --> 03:13.857
- Thank you.

03:27.037 --> 03:30.573
Honey, hey.
We have to talk.

03:30.574 --> 03:33.510
I screwed up.
- No.

03:33.511 --> 03:36.746
- Hey, I'm being
serious here.

03:36.747 --> 03:38.181
- Let me guess-

03:38.182 --> 03:41.117
one of your gal pals
wants to talk to page six?

03:41.118 --> 03:43.686
- Worse, okay?

03:43.687 --> 03:45.522
Much worse.

03:48.025 --> 03:50.193
- Get ready
for school, sweetie.

03:50.194 --> 03:53.596
Mom and dad
need some privacy.

03:53.597 --> 03:57.000
It's okay.
I promise.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.974
- Sara!

04:06.443 --> 04:08.378
Sara!

04:11.982 --> 04:13.983
Sara?

04:22.526 --> 04:25.028
Oh, my God!

05:17.728 --> 05:18.995
Apartment was

05:18.996 --> 05:21.764
Neighbors heard a shot
about 9:15 A.M.

05:21.765 --> 05:23.800
Her boyfriend
found her about 10:00.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.268
Why'd you call us?

05:25.269 --> 05:28.171
College kid gets popped,
parents get freaked.

05:28.172 --> 05:29.472
Welcome back, detectives.

05:29.473 --> 05:31.441
First responders
left her in the carpet.

05:31.442 --> 05:33.476
Paramedics took her pulse,
knew she was gone.

05:33.477 --> 05:35.778
They left her for you.

05:35.779 --> 05:39.883
All right, let's just
clear this area out, please.

05:39.884 --> 05:42.318
Uh, photos?

05:48.792 --> 05:52.395
Okay, looks like
one in the chest-

05:52.396 --> 05:54.964
22-caliber, close range.

05:54.965 --> 05:57.567
Looks like she might have known
who shot her.

05:57.568 --> 05:59.335
The killer wrapped
her in the carpet,

05:59.336 --> 06:01.337
then leaves her body.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.673
Haven't seen that before.

06:03.674 --> 06:06.576
Maybe he was trying to bring
the body somewhere

06:06.577 --> 06:07.844
and got spooked.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.179
Fancy clothes for a student.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.982
At least we know
who her favorite designer is.

06:12.983 --> 06:15.485
Nyle Brite.

06:15.486 --> 06:16.786
Not cheap either.

06:16.787 --> 06:20.123
Plenty of trust-fund babies
at Hudson.

06:22.126 --> 06:24.160
Bag that.

06:27.698 --> 06:31.267
There's
at least $5,000 here.

06:31.268 --> 06:33.703
I didn't have that kind
of spending money in college.

06:33.704 --> 06:36.205
It's more
than I have now.

06:38.142 --> 06:40.777
Wow.

06:40.778 --> 06:45.148
She's an actress...

06:45.149 --> 06:49.786
Or maybe something else?

06:49.787 --> 06:54.223
Nice clarinet.

06:54.224 --> 06:57.193
The Reed's still on it-
dusty, though.

06:57.194 --> 06:59.028
I don't think she played
the clarinet.

06:59.029 --> 07:00.863
She has admirers too.

07:00.864 --> 07:03.633
"You're a lying,
selfish bitch.

07:03.634 --> 07:06.569
I pray to God
you burn in hell."

07:09.506 --> 07:12.075
She was fantastic.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.577
Not according
to the text you sent last night.

07:14.578 --> 07:16.179
My favorite is...

07:16.180 --> 07:18.481
"You used your beauty
as a weapon

07:18.482 --> 07:21.584
to murder the souls
of innocent men."

07:21.585 --> 07:23.219
- I went overboard.
I'm sorry.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.421
- You found the body, Nathan.
That's ground zero.

07:25.422 --> 07:26.723
Jealous boyfriend?

07:26.724 --> 07:29.158
- If I did it,
why would I call 911?

07:30.561 --> 07:32.829
To make us think
you didn't do it?

07:32.830 --> 07:35.598
Eames.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.808
How long
were you dating Sara?

07:45.809 --> 07:47.343
Two weeks.

07:47.344 --> 07:48.678
And you were
already texting

07:48.679 --> 07:51.047
about the murder
of innocent souls?

07:51.048 --> 07:52.382
She was brilliant.

07:52.383 --> 07:54.350
She could quote
Byron and shelley-

07:54.351 --> 07:56.953
did you ever give her
any gifts,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.421
money?

07:58.422 --> 08:00.456
I paid her rent this month.

08:00.457 --> 08:02.025
- That's love.

08:02.026 --> 08:04.227
After only two weeks?

08:04.228 --> 08:05.928
Do you think
that anybody else

08:05.929 --> 08:09.298
might have been paying
her rent

08:09.299 --> 08:11.601
for the occasional...

08:11.602 --> 08:13.503
You know, pay for play?

08:13.504 --> 08:15.772
- What?

08:15.773 --> 08:17.306
No way.

08:17.307 --> 08:18.508
That's ridiculous.

08:18.509 --> 08:21.844
She-she liked to party
with her girlfriends.

08:21.845 --> 08:24.947
- Okay.

08:24.948 --> 08:26.949
You're gonna come
downtown with us,

08:26.950 --> 08:30.787
and we're gonna check
your alibi.

08:30.788 --> 08:33.121
There you go.

08:33.123 --> 08:34.524
- Her I.D. Was fake.

08:34.525 --> 08:36.558
Turns out Sara
wasn't enrolled at Hudson.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.797
She was pretending
to be a student.

08:40.798 --> 08:44.867
- Rich, old guys
love college girls.

08:44.868 --> 08:46.803
"Generous gentlemen only."

08:46.804 --> 08:49.472
- I'm sure she found a few.

08:49.473 --> 08:51.741
How are we doing with the idiot
who sent the crazy texts?

08:51.742 --> 08:53.142
- Nathan's alibi is clean.

08:53.143 --> 08:55.545
He was at the gym
from 8:40 to 10:05.

08:55.546 --> 08:57.280
- If she used him
to pay her rent,

08:57.281 --> 08:59.582
she was using
other people too.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.485
There's another pissed-off
boyfriend out there somewhere.

09:02.486 --> 09:05.755
- Ran Sara's prints-
no records in the database.

09:05.756 --> 09:07.390
Two days before the murder,

09:07.391 --> 09:10.460
someone from Nyle Brite
called Sara five times,

09:10.461 --> 09:11.961
three times the next day.

09:11.962 --> 09:15.932
- That's one happy customer.
- Or unhappy customer.

09:15.933 --> 09:18.034
- Nyle Brite's
the "bad boy" of fashion.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.570
His little soirees
are legendary.

09:20.571 --> 09:22.872
Sara had over a dozen
of his dresses in her closet.

09:22.873 --> 09:25.541
- I'm guessing
she didn't pay retail.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.176
Problem is...

09:27.177 --> 09:29.412
Is that all the calls
came from the main office.

09:29.413 --> 09:31.280
The company has
over 300 employees.

09:31.281 --> 09:36.419
- Yeah, but only one who brags
about how he pays to play.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.287
- You like it?
- No.

09:38.288 --> 09:39.989
- I love it!

09:39.990 --> 09:41.657
- It's gonna be bigger
than the plunge dress.

09:41.658 --> 09:43.359
- It's already bigger
than the plunge dress!

09:43.360 --> 09:44.861
Oh, my gosh!

09:44.862 --> 09:47.797
Nyle Brite is gonna make
Marc Jacobs his prison bitch!

09:47.798 --> 09:49.298
- Nyle, come here.
Let me see you.

09:49.299 --> 09:50.833
Let me see your eyes.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.436
For God's sake, man, bankers
are gonna be here in an hour.

09:53.437 --> 09:54.971
- Good. That's great!
That's great!

09:54.972 --> 09:56.339
They should be
here in an hour.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.540
I never felt more present
or intuitive.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.642
- Or more wired.
- Wi-

09:59.643 --> 10:01.511
well, Paul, come on, man.

10:01.512 --> 10:03.980
- You're a mess, Nyle.
You need to see a doctor.

10:03.981 --> 10:05.648
Oh, there it is again-
the "j" word.

10:05.649 --> 10:07.250
I thought we agreed,
there's no room for judgment

10:07.251 --> 10:08.518
in a creative workplace.

10:08.519 --> 10:10.319
- There's also no room
for psychotic behavior

10:10.320 --> 10:11.788
and gross stupidity, okay?

10:11.789 --> 10:13.356
I got six Goldman sachs bankers

10:13.357 --> 10:15.324
coming over here in an hour
to sign off on this thing-

10:15.325 --> 10:18.728
- are you under the impression
that you're my boss?

10:18.729 --> 10:20.530
- We're talking
about $300 million, okay?

10:20.531 --> 10:22.732
- I've never been
more in control.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.834
I'm at one
with the cosmos.

10:24.835 --> 10:26.335
I got it together.

10:26.336 --> 10:27.503
You're the one-
you don't have it together.

10:27.504 --> 10:29.105
I'm square. You're square.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.874
We're squares.
- Come here.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.544
If you blow this deal...

10:34.545 --> 10:37.046
I will bury you.

10:37.047 --> 10:38.748
I swear to God.

10:38.749 --> 10:41.184
Get straight, now.

10:41.185 --> 10:44.854
- Bye, Paul.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.722
- Someone hit her.

10:46.723 --> 10:50.326
It was hard to spot,
because it's above the hairline.

10:50.327 --> 10:53.229
It's a star-shaped cut,
black and blue-

10:53.230 --> 10:54.831
some type
of blunt-force trauma.

10:54.832 --> 10:56.999
- Any idea what caused it?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.168
- A fist, most likely.

10:59.169 --> 11:00.269
Indentation's unusual.

11:00.270 --> 11:02.104
Doer may have been wearing
a ring.

11:02.105 --> 11:04.140
- It's still black and blue,

11:04.141 --> 11:07.310
which means she was injured,
what, a day before she was shot?

11:07.311 --> 11:09.512
- Yeah, give or take.
Happened prior to the shooting.

11:09.513 --> 11:13.549
- So college boy Nathan
alibies for her murder,

11:13.550 --> 11:16.118
but maybe he clocked her
out of jealousy.

11:16.119 --> 11:19.689
- The guy is a wuss.
He got conned into paying rent.

11:19.690 --> 11:22.892
He's a whiner, not a hitter.

11:22.893 --> 11:26.195
So she got hit
while turning away.

11:26.196 --> 11:28.097
Someone was swinging at her.

11:28.098 --> 11:31.067
So it plays out
like an argument

11:31.068 --> 11:34.036
that amped out of control.

11:42.546 --> 11:44.413
Can you tell us
where Nyle Brite is?

11:44.414 --> 11:45.681
Nyle Brite?

11:45.682 --> 11:47.450
- Uh, sorry.
He doesn't talk to people.

11:47.451 --> 11:49.418
- We're not people.

11:49.419 --> 11:50.920
- Uh, yeah,
he's right here.

11:50.921 --> 11:54.023
Hi, can I help you?

11:54.024 --> 11:56.826
- Do you recognize
this young woman?

11:56.827 --> 11:58.427
- No.

11:58.428 --> 11:59.962
- Her name's Sara bell.
She's a call girl.

11:59.963 --> 12:02.765
She never attended any
of your parties?

12:02.766 --> 12:04.667
- Uh, well, I didn't say
I'd never seen her.

12:04.668 --> 12:07.303
I said I didn't recognize
her, okay?

12:07.304 --> 12:09.805
And I don't really remember her
being at any of my parties.

12:09.806 --> 12:13.109
- Her closet was full
of Nyle Brite clothing.

12:13.110 --> 12:16.379
- You just went
from present tense to past.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.981
- That's because she died.

12:18.982 --> 12:20.549
- How?

12:20.550 --> 12:23.152
- She was murdered.

12:23.153 --> 12:26.989
You ever give her any clothes,
maybe as a gift?

12:26.990 --> 12:28.424
- No.

12:28.425 --> 12:30.426
I don't shower escorts
with gifts.

12:30.427 --> 12:31.994
I don't serenade them
with sonnets.

12:31.995 --> 12:33.362
It kind of defeats
the purpose.

12:33.363 --> 12:35.865
Besides, I don't know
who that is, so...

12:35.866 --> 12:37.500
- Maybe you could take
one last look?

12:37.501 --> 12:40.036
- Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?

12:40.037 --> 12:41.437
I have a press junket
in an hour,

12:41.438 --> 12:43.472
and you shove a picture
of a dead hooker in my face?

12:43.473 --> 12:44.774
Bad vibes, man!

12:44.775 --> 12:46.108
Bad mojo!
- I'm apologizing.

12:46.109 --> 12:47.977
- Where were you this morning?

12:47.978 --> 12:51.847
- I-I was
at my shrink at 8:00.

12:51.848 --> 12:55.451
And then I had breakfast
with my wife, Debra,

12:55.452 --> 12:57.520
and my friend Teddy.

12:57.521 --> 12:58.788
He's there.

12:58.789 --> 12:59.889
Now, if you have
any more questions,

12:59.890 --> 13:03.159
you can talk
to my army of lawyers.

13:07.631 --> 13:10.132
- Yeah, we had breakfast
at the peninsula

13:10.133 --> 13:12.401
around, uh, 9:30 or 10:00.

13:12.402 --> 13:14.570
- Ever seen her before?

13:14.571 --> 13:17.974
- That's Sara, of course.

13:17.975 --> 13:19.875
Oh, my God, she's dead?

13:19.876 --> 13:21.210
How?

13:21.211 --> 13:25.247
- She was shot
with a.22.

13:25.248 --> 13:27.683
- Did you two "date"?

13:27.684 --> 13:30.553
- Well, we, um...

13:30.554 --> 13:32.521
Several times.

13:32.522 --> 13:34.557
Sweet kid,
beautiful too.

13:34.558 --> 13:37.793
I can't believe she's dead.
That's terrible.

13:37.794 --> 13:41.097
- When's the last time
you saw her?

13:41.098 --> 13:42.732
- A couple days ago...

13:42.733 --> 13:44.367
At the party
after Nyle's runway show.

13:44.368 --> 13:47.670
I got her and some other girls
to show up at his after-party.

13:47.671 --> 13:49.005
- Did she and Nyle
hook up that night?

13:49.006 --> 13:50.239
- No, no, no.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.143
He was, uh,
otherwise engaged.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.380
Right.

13:57.381 --> 13:59.982
Did you ever call Sara
from your office phone?

13:59.983 --> 14:03.486
No, I text.

14:03.487 --> 14:06.022
"Special consultant
to Nyle Brite."

14:06.023 --> 14:08.290
Special consultant,
that's, uh...

14:08.291 --> 14:09.925
Uh, fancy.

14:09.926 --> 14:12.161
- I'm a sounding board.
- You're a sounding board.

14:12.162 --> 14:14.397
Oh.

14:14.398 --> 14:16.599
So you do whatever's
necessary for Nyle,

14:16.600 --> 14:21.037
like keeping him in a positive
psychological state.

14:21.038 --> 14:23.672
- Correct.
- Right.

14:23.673 --> 14:25.007
- Like buying him
cocaine and hookers?

14:25.008 --> 14:26.342
- Much more than that.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.676
Trust me, we grew up
on the same block

14:27.677 --> 14:29.345
in teaneck, new Jersey,

14:29.346 --> 14:31.213
back when he was
Norman Briteling.

14:31.214 --> 14:33.482
Okay?

14:33.483 --> 14:34.750
- Right.

14:34.751 --> 14:36.452
Okay.

14:36.453 --> 14:39.155
Thanks.

14:39.156 --> 14:40.823
- Let's see Nyle's shrink.

14:40.824 --> 14:45.327
Maybe she can give us a window
into the cesspool of his mind.

14:45.328 --> 14:47.329
- I met with Nyle
at 8:00 this morning.

14:47.330 --> 14:50.633
- Look, I-I know
you can't violate

14:50.634 --> 14:52.101
doctor-patient privilege,

14:52.102 --> 14:54.703
but is there anything
you can tell us that might help?

14:54.704 --> 14:56.605
- I can tell you
that in session,

14:56.606 --> 14:58.641
he said he'd received flowers
from a girl-

14:58.642 --> 14:59.909
an ex, I suppose.

14:59.910 --> 15:01.510
He was very upset.

15:01.511 --> 15:04.280
- Was her name Sara bell?
- He didn't say.

15:04.281 --> 15:06.949
Uh, now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a patient.

15:06.950 --> 15:09.885
- I'm just noticing,
palm beach real estate.

15:09.886 --> 15:13.689
Business must be good,
especially in this economy.

15:13.690 --> 15:14.990
You know,
I just thought

15:14.991 --> 15:16.592
that pricey therapists
would be something

15:16.593 --> 15:17.827
that people were
cutting back on,

15:17.828 --> 15:20.029
you know, like-I don't know-
white truffles.

15:20.030 --> 15:22.198
- Well, there's, uh,
only one reason

15:22.199 --> 15:24.767
it's better to have wealthy
clients than poor ones.

15:24.768 --> 15:25.768
- What's that?

15:25.769 --> 15:27.736
- Well, the wealthy ones know

15:27.737 --> 15:30.773
that money doesn't solve
your problems.

15:34.144 --> 15:36.145
- Her credit card
indicates Sara bell

15:36.146 --> 15:40.483
spent $145 on flowers
last Sunday.

15:40.484 --> 15:41.917
- Yes, here it is.

15:41.918 --> 15:45.321
She sent a bouquet
to Mr. Nyle Brite for $145.

15:45.322 --> 15:47.456
- She include a note?

15:50.327 --> 15:51.727
- "You said I was
your one and only.

15:51.728 --> 15:53.496
Now reap what you've sown."

15:53.497 --> 15:54.763
That's it-

15:54.764 --> 15:57.900
no sign-off, no signature,
no smiley face.

15:57.901 --> 16:01.270
- Okay.
Thanks.

16:01.271 --> 16:03.272
- "Now reap what you've sown."

16:03.273 --> 16:04.974
- It's a threat.

16:04.975 --> 16:07.409
Maybe she had something
that could blow him up.

16:07.410 --> 16:08.744
It would have
to be pretty big.

16:08.745 --> 16:10.679
The whole world knows
he shags hookers.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.015
You saw the skull ring
on his right hand?

16:13.016 --> 16:14.717
He's the one
that hit her.

16:14.718 --> 16:19.054
And she tried to blackmail him
the day before she died.

16:20.307 --> 16:21.908
Today's business section
just announced

16:21.909 --> 16:24.544
Nyle Brite going public
in three weeks.

16:24.545 --> 16:26.145
- Not a great time
for him to clobber

16:26.146 --> 16:28.047
a 100-pound escort,

16:28.048 --> 16:30.149
or kill her,
for thatatter.

16:30.150 --> 16:33.019
- Anything else on this guy-
fingerprints, blood evidence?

16:33.020 --> 16:34.354
- No, but it's pretty clear

16:34.355 --> 16:36.022
he lied
about knowing the victim.

16:36.023 --> 16:37.357
- What about his alibi?

16:37.358 --> 16:39.058
We have the surveillance
from the peninsula yet?

16:39.059 --> 16:41.127
- Nyle showed up at 9:37.

16:41.128 --> 16:43.630
His pal Teddy
showed up at 9:41.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.231
- Well, TOD. Was 9:15.

16:45.232 --> 16:47.233
That means either one of them
had time to kill this girl

16:47.234 --> 16:48.635
and go out for a Danish.

16:48.636 --> 16:50.403
Any other suspects?

16:50.404 --> 16:53.206
- There's Paul Keller,
ceo of Nyle Brite,

16:53.207 --> 16:54.707
and also Nyle's wife, Debra.

16:54.708 --> 16:56.175
We tried to reach her.

16:56.176 --> 16:58.211
She went to Florida
right after the breakfast.

16:58.212 --> 17:00.246
She's back now.

17:00.247 --> 17:01.881
- A lot of people stand
to get very rich on this I.P.O.

17:01.882 --> 17:04.550
That means a lot of people
had a damn good motive

17:04.550 --> 17:07.053
for murder.

17:07.054 --> 17:08.721
- I'm sorry, but what does
a hooker's murder

17:08.722 --> 17:10.423
have to do with me
or my company?

17:10.424 --> 17:14.359
- We believe she was trying
to blackmail Nyle Brite.

17:14.361 --> 17:16.329
- You know,
I checked your resume.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.431
You've had three companies
that have gone belly-up.

17:18.432 --> 17:21.601
Are you texting us
right now?

17:21.602 --> 17:25.938
Because we're
the ones talking to you.

17:25.939 --> 17:28.673
This I.P.O.
Is a big deal for you.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.810
You're looking
at $50 million if it closes?

17:31.811 --> 17:33.979
- Where were you
Monday morning?

17:33.980 --> 17:35.614
- I was at home
with my wife till 9:00.

17:35.615 --> 17:37.682
I went to the office
about 9:30.

17:37.683 --> 17:40.986
Look, I know absolutely nothing
about this woman.

17:40.987 --> 17:43.722
- We'd like to see
the registration statement.

17:43.723 --> 17:46.458
You know, we'd like to know who
your major stockholders are.

17:46.459 --> 17:49.027
- Well, you feel free to contact
our attorneys, all right?

17:49.028 --> 17:50.862
- How about I call Goldman?

17:50.863 --> 17:52.330
Let me see.

17:52.331 --> 17:53.865
"Goldman," here it is.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.734
Let's see. We'll just tell them
that you're involved

17:55.735 --> 17:57.035
in a murder investigation-

17:57.036 --> 17:58.570
- okay, all right, all right.

17:58.571 --> 18:01.673
I'll, uh-I'll have my assistant
send everything over today.

18:01.674 --> 18:02.741
- Oh, good.

18:02.742 --> 18:04.242
Just one more thing-

18:04.243 --> 18:06.578
does it bother you that the star
of your fashion house

18:06.579 --> 18:10.048
has a serious
addiction problem?

18:10.049 --> 18:12.751
- My brother died ten years ago
of a drug overdose.

18:12.752 --> 18:14.686
He was 28.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.721
So, yeah, I take addiction
very seriously.

18:16.722 --> 18:20.358
- I'm sorry
about your brother.

18:20.359 --> 18:23.695
I lost my brother
in the same way.

18:23.696 --> 18:25.964
It just seems to me
like you need to focus more

18:25.965 --> 18:30.502
on getting him into rehab
than on your I.P.O. Closing.

18:30.503 --> 18:33.571
- Yeah, well,
I'm a businessman,

18:33.572 --> 18:35.707
not a Saint.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.709
- Obviously.

18:40.146 --> 18:43.148
- I got to the peninsula
at 9:45.

18:43.149 --> 18:45.283
Teddy and Nyle
were already there.

18:45.284 --> 18:46.551
- The murder was at 9:15,

18:46.552 --> 18:49.821
which makes all three of you
persons of interest.

18:49.822 --> 18:54.292
- You went to Florida
immediately after breakfast.

18:54.293 --> 18:56.227
You came back
nine hours later.

18:56.228 --> 18:58.964
- Nyle and I are looking
at condos down there.

18:58.965 --> 19:03.034
- Did you know Sara bell?

19:03.035 --> 19:06.237
- No.
Never met her.

19:06.238 --> 19:08.873
Go to your room, sweetie.

19:08.874 --> 19:10.308
It's okay.

19:10.309 --> 19:14.546
The police are just asking
a few questions.

19:14.547 --> 19:17.515
- That's your and Nyle's son.

19:17.516 --> 19:19.584
- Yes.
That's Tyler.

19:19.585 --> 19:21.386
- Doesn't it bother you

19:21.387 --> 19:24.589
that Nyle dates
porn stars and prostitutes?

19:24.590 --> 19:27.525
- I've been with Nyle
for 20 years.

19:27.526 --> 19:29.561
We're best friends.

19:29.562 --> 19:32.230
He suffers
from multiple addictions.

19:32.231 --> 19:34.299
But I can assure you
he didn't hit,

19:34.300 --> 19:36.701
much less kill,
a call girl.

19:36.702 --> 19:39.270
Nyle gets upset
when he steps on a spider.

19:42.074 --> 19:45.643
- I have some of these
"livestrong" bands at home.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.412
- Hmm.

19:47.413 --> 19:50.048
It's kind of amazing
how much money Lance Armstrong

19:50.049 --> 19:51.716
raised with those bracelets.

19:51.717 --> 19:52.984
- Yeah.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.158
- She must know

20:00.159 --> 20:02.027
"livestrong" bracelets
are yellow.

20:02.028 --> 20:04.095
- Well, you know
they wear the purple ones

20:04.096 --> 20:06.197
to raise awareness
for domestic violence.

20:06.198 --> 20:08.199
- Debra's a victim.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.936
- Did you see the-the way
her son was watching us?

20:11.937 --> 20:14.105
That's typical behavior
for someone

20:14.106 --> 20:16.241
who was raised
around violence.

20:16.242 --> 20:18.043
- Let's see the man
who knew Norman Briteling

20:18.044 --> 20:19.811
way back when.

20:22.348 --> 20:23.748
Did Nyle ever tell you

20:23.749 --> 20:25.717
he was being blackmailed
by someone?

20:25.718 --> 20:27.318
- Nope.

20:27.319 --> 20:29.854
- We scrubbed Sara's texts.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.858
She sent you one
the day before she died.

20:33.859 --> 20:37.295
"I can't do this anymore.
I'm done."

20:37.296 --> 20:39.464
- She didn't want
to see me anymore.

20:39.465 --> 20:44.102
- A hooker ditching the John-
that'sounterintuitive.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.336
- She wanted out,

20:45.337 --> 20:48.606
and I figured maybe
we'd start hanging-

20:48.607 --> 20:50.642
boyfriend-girlfriend
kind of thing.

20:50.643 --> 20:53.678
It was delusional.

20:53.679 --> 20:55.580
Not the first time
I've been dumped.

20:55.581 --> 20:57.749
- Anyone else
ever blackmail Nyle?

21:05.891 --> 21:09.360
- About six months ago,
a woman named, um,

21:09.361 --> 21:12.464
yasmin had this video.

21:12.465 --> 21:16.034
It was pretty ugly.

21:16.035 --> 21:18.169
- Nyle didn't care
about the group-sex stuff,

21:18.170 --> 21:19.237
just the heroin.

21:19.238 --> 21:22.140
Image-
ass good, smack bad.

21:22.141 --> 21:24.576
- And then some guy in a suit
gave you a check for 20 grand?

21:24.577 --> 21:27.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Was his name Paul Keller-

21:27.046 --> 21:28.980
white, 5'10", 40s?

21:28.981 --> 21:30.482
That's him.

21:30.483 --> 21:32.217
Told me if I ever whispered
that Nyle shot heroin,

21:32.218 --> 21:33.651
he would ruin my life.

21:33.652 --> 21:37.155
- Did you ever meet a woman-
Sara bell?

21:37.156 --> 21:38.590
- I saw her at Nyle's party.

21:38.591 --> 21:40.959
She's the reason
why it ended so fast.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.194
And totally fr,
Nyle saw her

21:43.195 --> 21:45.296
told everyone
to get the hell out.

21:45.297 --> 21:47.532
- Because he saw Sara?
- Mm-hmm.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.033
- They knew each other?

21:49.034 --> 21:50.335
- Knew each other?

21:50.336 --> 21:53.638
Hell, it looked like
they were married.

21:53.639 --> 21:55.140
- It's possible
she was at my party.

21:55.141 --> 21:56.941
Every beautiful woman
in Manhattan was there,

21:56.942 --> 21:58.676
except for you, of course.

21:58.677 --> 22:00.378
- Yasmin told us
you shut the party down

22:00.379 --> 22:02.046
the second you saw Sara.

22:02.047 --> 22:03.448
Why?

22:03.449 --> 22:06.518
You lied to us
about knowing her.

22:06.519 --> 22:09.220
Is that because
you killed her

22:09.221 --> 22:12.323
after she tried to blackmail you
for hitting her?

22:12.324 --> 22:14.159
- Are you a crazy person?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.960
Are you not right?

22:15.961 --> 22:19.797
Because I will sue
your asses for slander!

22:19.798 --> 22:21.966
- You ever play
a musical instrument?

22:21.967 --> 22:24.135
- What?
- No, I'm just saying

22:24.136 --> 22:26.037
that, you know, a lot
of great artists-

22:26.038 --> 22:27.772
they express themselves
in more than one way,

22:27.773 --> 22:30.475
you know, like a great actor
will paint.

22:30.476 --> 22:32.944
- I play clarinet.
I took it up when I was 12.

22:32.945 --> 22:34.913
- Really?

22:36.582 --> 22:37.582
12?

22:37.583 --> 22:39.450
- Yeah.

22:39.451 --> 22:43.288
- Did you ever give Sara
a clarinet as a gift?

22:43.289 --> 22:46.758
- I'm late for a meeting uptown.
I just...

22:46.759 --> 22:49.427
- You have.

22:49.428 --> 22:51.296
Why would you give
a call girl

22:51.297 --> 22:55.266
a clarinet that you played
when you were 12?

22:55.267 --> 22:57.402
Unless you gave it to her
when she was 12.

22:57.403 --> 23:00.205
You're crazy, man.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.407
- Yeah.

23:02.408 --> 23:06.311
That's why you called off
the party that night...

23:06.312 --> 23:08.947
'Cause the hooker
that Teddy brought

23:08.948 --> 23:11.516
was your daughter.

23:11.517 --> 23:14.719
- Reap what you sow.

23:24.189 --> 23:26.190
Chloe Miller...

23:26.191 --> 23:29.227
Born 1991...

23:29.228 --> 23:33.598
Changed her name
to Sara bell in 2005.

23:36.034 --> 23:38.536
Your daughter.

23:38.537 --> 23:41.839
Father's name isn't on the
birth certificate, of course.

23:41.840 --> 23:45.710
But the mother's is-
susannah Miller.

23:45.711 --> 23:48.379
Susannah...

23:48.380 --> 23:51.883
Uh, old girlfriend?

23:51.884 --> 23:53.484
She was a Ford model.

23:53.485 --> 23:57.555
We dated for a few weeks,
and then she got pregnant.

23:57.556 --> 24:00.558
She still live in the area?

24:00.559 --> 24:02.560
- No.

24:02.561 --> 24:05.763
She...
she moved to Paris

24:05.764 --> 24:07.732
when my daughter,
Chloe, was 12.

24:07.733 --> 24:10.535
- I'd married Debra by then,
and we had Tyler,

24:10.536 --> 24:12.770
but I never told Debra or Tyler
about Chloe.

24:12.771 --> 24:14.572
I never-
I never told anybody.

24:14.573 --> 24:17.508
- She was
your first-born child,

24:17.509 --> 24:18.910
your one and only.

24:18.911 --> 24:22.380
I mean, that's what
you told her, right?

24:22.381 --> 24:26.751
She was
your one-and-only girl?

24:26.752 --> 24:28.519
- I read her poetry-

24:28.520 --> 24:31.188
shelley, Byron, keats.

24:31.189 --> 24:33.858
She was an angel.
I loved her.

24:33.859 --> 24:35.593
- Until you found out
she was a call girl.

24:35.594 --> 24:38.462
- I wanted to pretend that
the whole thing never happened.

24:38.463 --> 24:41.132
I wanted to pretend that she
never showed up at my party,

24:41.133 --> 24:42.466
that she wasn't
a prostitute.

24:42.467 --> 24:44.869
I wanted to pretend
that I didn't-

24:44.870 --> 24:48.673
- you didn't what?

24:48.674 --> 24:52.677
- That I-that I didn't-
that I didn't judge her.

24:58.383 --> 25:02.520
- So you recognized her
at the party.

25:07.192 --> 25:10.194
I guess Teddy
gave you her address.

25:10.195 --> 25:13.331
You went to the apartment.

25:13.332 --> 25:15.900
And you started arguing.

25:15.901 --> 25:17.835
- Yeah.

25:17.836 --> 25:21.405
She started to cry.

25:21.406 --> 25:24.175
She said she wanted to get
out of the business.

25:24.176 --> 25:25.676
- And then you punched her
in the head.

25:25.677 --> 25:26.911
- Oh, okay.

25:26.912 --> 25:28.512
That was the ring.

25:28.513 --> 25:30.147
She slapped me first.
I lost it.

25:30.148 --> 25:31.716
I had been
on a three-day bender,

25:31.717 --> 25:33.818
and I was totally nervous
about the show and the I.P.O.

25:33.819 --> 25:36.387
- All legitimate reasons to beat
the crap out of your daughter.

25:36.388 --> 25:38.489
- I know what
you're doing, okay?

25:38.490 --> 25:40.257
You want to book me
for assault, that's fine!

25:40.258 --> 25:41.792
But you can't book me
for murder,

25:41.793 --> 25:43.527
'cause I didn't kill Chloe-
she's my daughter!

25:43.528 --> 25:45.162
I'll have my team
of lawyers in here.

25:45.163 --> 25:46.864
They'll bail me out
in five minutes!

25:46.865 --> 25:49.300
And then I'm gonna go public
on the offense with my truth!

25:49.301 --> 25:52.503
- You're a train wreck.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.441
- We have to do whatever
is necessary to protect Nyle.

25:57.442 --> 26:00.645
Assault charges against
a hooker we can brush away.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.980
But it's a little difficult
to go public

26:02.981 --> 26:05.149
when the face of your company's
in jail for murder.

26:05.150 --> 26:07.551
- Everything will be fine.

26:07.552 --> 26:11.922
- Really?
Tell me something, doctor.

26:11.923 --> 26:13.424
Did the idiot do it?

26:15.994 --> 26:18.062
- I can't breach
my confidentiality.

26:19.297 --> 26:21.065
Do me a favor-
save your sanctimonious speech

26:21.066 --> 26:22.967
for somebody else, honey.

26:22.968 --> 26:26.337
I know the little game
you and your pal are playing.

26:32.811 --> 26:35.546
- So in the past six months,

26:35.547 --> 26:40.151
Nyle's transferred $70 million
in stock to a family trust.

26:40.152 --> 26:42.186
- That's pretty typical,
isn't it?

26:42.187 --> 26:44.755
- Yeah, when you're
the beneficiary.

26:44.756 --> 26:47.191
But Nyle's not involved
at all.

26:47.192 --> 26:49.627
It's like he gave
$70 million in cash away.

26:49.628 --> 26:51.529
Guess who gets the money.

26:51.530 --> 26:55.499
- I knew there was a reason
the wife was still around.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.501
- Nyle wanted to provide
a nest egg

26:57.502 --> 27:01.405
for me and Tyler in the event
something happened to him.

27:01.406 --> 27:05.476
Right, so he just,
you know, woke up one day

27:05.477 --> 27:08.846
and decided he was gonna
transfer 80% of his assets

27:08.847 --> 27:11.182
to the family trust.

27:11.183 --> 27:13.718
I don't know-seems like
a pretty elaborate plan

27:13.719 --> 27:15.152
for someone like Nyle.

27:15.153 --> 27:17.421
- Nyle's brilliant.
- I'm sure he is.

27:17.422 --> 27:20.491
He just doesn't seem
like a detail-oriented,

27:20.492 --> 27:23.260
you know, "plan for the future"
kind of guy.

27:23.261 --> 27:25.362
- Well, luckily for him,
he has lots of advisers

27:25.363 --> 27:28.632
who are detail-oriented
"plan for the future" types.

27:28.633 --> 27:30.701
- Like who?

27:30.702 --> 27:32.303
- Like his lawyer,
his accountant,

27:32.304 --> 27:34.138
his psychiatrist.

27:34.139 --> 27:37.308
- Dr. Harper
your shrink too?

27:37.309 --> 27:38.342
- Yes.

27:38.343 --> 27:40.177
I've been with her for years.

27:40.178 --> 27:43.714
- Since Nyle started
abusing you?

27:43.715 --> 27:45.516
- Excuse me?

27:45.517 --> 27:46.784
- He might not kill spiders,

27:46.785 --> 27:49.153
but he's pretty good
at beating up women.

27:49.154 --> 27:52.656
- This is very elegant.

27:52.657 --> 27:55.559
This part
of his new collection?

27:55.560 --> 27:58.796
- Yes.

27:58.797 --> 28:01.665
- Mom, dad's on tv.
Just turn it on.

28:04.903 --> 28:07.204
<i> I'm done, okay?</i>

28:07.205 --> 28:08.939
<i>I'm done pretending
that decadence, hedonism,</i>

28:08.940 --> 28:10.541
<i>and self-love
are all negative concepts.</i>

28:10.542 --> 28:12.109
<i>I mean, what's more beautiful
than loving yourself, huh,</i>

28:12.110 --> 28:13.744
<i>taking care of yourself,
pampering yourself,</i>

28:13.745 --> 28:15.579
<i>indulging your wild impulses?</i>

28:15.580 --> 28:17.114
<i>W- what's better than that?</i>

28:17.115 --> 28:18.582
<i>The pursuit of joy,
the pursuit of happiness-</i>

28:18.583 --> 28:19.884
<i>that's in our constitution.</i>

28:19.885 --> 28:21.418
<i>Are you along
for the ride, my brother?</i>

28:21.419 --> 28:23.420
<i>- I'm along for the ride.
- You're along for the ride!</i>

28:23.421 --> 28:25.422
<i>He's along for the ride!
You're along for the ride!</i>

28:25.423 --> 28:26.891
<i>Let me-let me tell you
something.</i>

28:26.892 --> 28:28.726
<i>I work fast-
you got to buckle up,</i>

28:28.727 --> 28:30.194
<i>'cause that's the key
to success, is speed.</i>

28:30.195 --> 28:31.762
<i>The key to success is speed.</i>

28:31.763 --> 28:32.863
<i>A synapse comes, it hits, pow!</i>

28:32.864 --> 28:34.198
<i>You got to ride
that thing out, man.</i>

28:34.199 --> 28:35.866
<i>That's how
the big dogs do it, man-</i>

28:35.867 --> 28:39.003
<i>instinct, instinct!</i>

28:39.004 --> 28:40.871
<i>You got it!</i>
- Way to go, dad.

28:40.872 --> 28:42.873
<i>- That's how we do it,
not-not people like you.</i>

28:42.874 --> 28:44.575
<i>I'm talking to you,
you son of a bitch.</i>

28:44.576 --> 28:46.744
<i>You know exactly who you are.
I'm Mick Jagger.</i>

28:46.745 --> 28:49.213
<i>You're the talentless,
faceless zero backstage</i>

28:49.214 --> 28:50.981
<i>making sure I have enough
water to drink,</i>

28:50.982 --> 28:52.449
<i>so deal with it.</i>

28:55.720 --> 29:00.124
- Must be tough having
Nyle Brite as a role model.

29:00.125 --> 29:05.262
- Did you know that Nyle had
a daughter named Chloe Miller?

29:05.263 --> 29:09.400
- If you have more questions,
talk to my lawyer.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.808
- Does your father
know you're a whore?

29:17.809 --> 29:20.644
I'm just curious.

29:20.645 --> 29:21.645
- No.

29:21.646 --> 29:23.080
- Do me a favor.

29:23.081 --> 29:26.350
Tomorrow-tomorrow morning,
right, right when you wake up,

29:26.351 --> 29:28.118
call him.

29:28.119 --> 29:30.154
Call your father
and tell him that you love him.

29:30.155 --> 29:32.823
Do it...

29:32.824 --> 29:35.292
For me.

29:35.293 --> 29:39.029
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:51.076 --> 29:53.911
- So this nut job goes on tv.
It goes viral.

29:53.912 --> 29:55.946
He's all over the news.

29:55.947 --> 29:59.049
All right, he bailed
on the assault charge,

29:59.050 --> 30:01.285
so let's step into him.

30:01.286 --> 30:03.020
Look for outstanding warrants,

30:03.021 --> 30:05.322
parking tickets,
hell, jaywalking.

30:05.323 --> 30:07.424
Let's bring him in so we can get
another run at him.

30:07.425 --> 30:09.426
- We checked his office.
He's not there.

30:09.427 --> 30:11.595
He's not at his
wife's apartment either.

30:11.596 --> 30:14.965
There's a town house registered
to his company on Hudson street.

30:14.966 --> 30:16.901
- I'm guessing that's
his home away from home.

30:16.902 --> 30:20.504
- Well, let's see if we can move
him into a studio at sing-sing.

30:20.505 --> 30:23.307
- If you heard
that "poof" today,

30:23.308 --> 30:26.110
<i>that was Nyle Brite's I.P.O.
Going up in smoke.</i>

30:26.111 --> 30:27.878
<i>Goldman sachs announced today</i>

30:27.879 --> 30:29.380
<i>that it is terminating...</i>

30:29.381 --> 30:31.482
<i>Its relationship
with Nyle Brite.</i>

30:31.483 --> 30:34.151
- It's open.
Hello?

30:34.152 --> 30:35.686
<i>- Brite's
early-morning interview</i>

30:35.687 --> 30:38.122
<i>is being cited as the cause.</i>

30:38.123 --> 30:39.657
- Nyle?

30:39.658 --> 30:41.792
<i>- He's along for the ride!
You're along for the ride!</i>

30:41.793 --> 30:43.127
- Anyone home?

30:43.128 --> 30:45.729
<i>'Cause that's the key
to success, is speed.</i>

30:45.730 --> 30:48.999
<i>The key to success is speed.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.668
<i>You got to ride

<i>That's how

30:52.270 --> 30:55.239
<i>instinct, instinct!</i>

30:55.240 --> 30:57.041
<i>You got it.
That's right!</i>

30:57.042 --> 30:59.176
<i>That's how we do it,
not-not people like you.</i>

30:59.177 --> 31:00.678
<i>I'm Mick Jagger-

31:25.937 --> 31:27.638
Hey, psst.

31:35.146 --> 31:38.449
- Show me your hands!
- Don't shoot, please!

31:39.845 --> 31:43.313
I was upstairs listening to music
when I heard these loud bangs.

31:43.514 --> 31:45.249
I'd been partying
pretty hard,

31:45.250 --> 31:48.352
so I didn't know
if I was dreaming or...

31:48.353 --> 31:50.220
- Did you call 911?

31:50.221 --> 31:51.655
- I was too scared.

31:51.656 --> 31:53.056
I thought that the killer
might still be here,

31:53.057 --> 31:55.092
so I just hid
in the closet and prayed.

31:55.093 --> 31:57.928
- She didn't see anything.

31:57.929 --> 32:00.330
- Big surprise.
- Full-on circus-

32:00.331 --> 32:04.268
paparazzi, news vans,
panhandlers.

32:04.269 --> 32:05.502
- Page one,
tomorrow's <i>post-</i>

32:05.503 --> 32:06.670
Tsunami kills thousands,

32:06.671 --> 32:08.839
or Nyle Brite gets shot
in the heart?

32:08.840 --> 32:12.042
I wonder which it will be?

32:12.043 --> 32:14.044
That matches the sketch

32:14.045 --> 32:15.846
that was back
at Debra's apartment.

32:15.847 --> 32:17.681
- Say what you want,
but Nyle Brite

32:17.682 --> 32:19.549
knew how to design clothes.

32:19.550 --> 32:23.320
- So this is what we have...

32:23.321 --> 32:27.524
Five.22 shells,
all in the chest.

32:27.525 --> 32:31.495
Our killer was pissed.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.964
- Hey, just got word
from ballistics-it's a match.

32:33.965 --> 32:37.000
Same gun used
in the Sara bell murder.

32:37.001 --> 32:39.469
- We're looking
at the same shooter.

32:39.470 --> 32:41.505
- Besides our girl
in the closet,

32:41.506 --> 32:43.240
two other escorts
saw nothing,

32:43.241 --> 32:47.210
but one remembers
an angry phone call around 2:30,

32:47.211 --> 32:50.414
in which Nyle called
someone "a selfish bitch."

32:50.415 --> 32:51.982
- Debra?

32:51.983 --> 32:55.352
- Know anyone else
who matches that description?

32:55.353 --> 32:57.754
- You drag me
in here at night-

32:57.755 --> 32:59.389
my husband is dead.

32:59.390 --> 33:01.525
My son has to wait
in a police station.

33:01.526 --> 33:03.160
You better have
something good.

33:03.161 --> 33:05.195
- Here, have a seat.

33:07.498 --> 33:11.835
- We'll make this simple.

33:11.836 --> 33:15.939
Did you kill your husband
and his daughter?

33:15.940 --> 33:18.108
- Our company died

33:18.109 --> 33:21.078
the minute he went on tv.

33:21.079 --> 33:23.780
I wanted to kill him...

33:23.781 --> 33:27.084
But I didn't.

33:27.085 --> 33:28.518
- We left your apartment
at 2:00.

33:28.519 --> 33:31.221
Where were you
between then and 4:00?

33:31.222 --> 33:33.590
- At home with Tyler.

33:33.591 --> 33:35.726
- And Dr. Harper.

33:35.727 --> 33:37.894
- Excuse me?

33:37.895 --> 33:41.398
- You told us
th Nyle discussed

33:41.399 --> 33:43.967
his financial matters
with his psychiatrist,

33:43.968 --> 33:45.769
and I just find that odd.

33:45.770 --> 33:47.971
I mean, isn't it?

33:47.972 --> 33:49.439
- I have no idea.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.874
- No?

33:50.875 --> 33:54.044
Okay, well-all right,
maybe it's not for us to judge

33:54.045 --> 33:57.614
what people discuss
with their therapist.

33:57.615 --> 34:00.984
Dr. Harper's your girlfriend.

34:03.287 --> 34:06.990
- My private life
is irrelevant.

34:06.991 --> 34:09.659
- Sure.
You-you went to Florida

34:09.659 --> 34:11.928
right after Sara was killed.

34:11.929 --> 34:14.197
You were there
for nine hours.

34:14.197 --> 34:15.931
- We spoke
to a broker down there.

34:15.933 --> 34:19.402
Apparently you and Dr. Harper
are in negotiations

34:19.404 --> 34:23.072
for a $15 million house.

34:23.074 --> 34:25.074
- We found
this real-estate magazine

34:25.076 --> 34:28.844
in Dr. Harper's office.

34:28.846 --> 34:32.382
The two of you...

34:32.382 --> 34:35.152
You and Dr. Harper,
teamed up

34:35.152 --> 34:38.321
to exploit
Nyle's mental state

34:38.322 --> 34:41.792
and get rich...

34:41.793 --> 34:45.929
Move to Florida,
palm beach,

34:45.929 --> 34:49.766
live happily ever after.

34:49.766 --> 34:54.271
- It's not a crime to live
happily ever after, detective,

34:54.272 --> 34:58.475
especially after
20 years of abuse.

34:58.476 --> 35:00.277
I didn't kill
that young woman,

35:00.278 --> 35:03.413
and I didn't kill Nyle.

35:03.414 --> 35:06.683
I've let go of my anger.

35:14.826 --> 35:18.161
- Excuse me, please.

35:25.102 --> 35:27.871
Not bad.
You have talent.

35:27.872 --> 35:30.073
- Had a good teacher.

35:32.443 --> 35:33.777
- I'm sorry about your dad.

35:33.778 --> 35:36.613
- I'm not.

35:36.614 --> 35:39.716
- I-I saw one of his sketches
at-at your house.

35:39.717 --> 35:43.320
It was of a-a-a nice dress.

35:43.321 --> 35:44.988
He-he did have talent.

35:44.989 --> 35:47.123
- It wasn't his sketch.

35:47.124 --> 35:48.692
My mom covered for him,

35:48.693 --> 35:52.095
just like everybody else
covered for him all these years.

35:54.966 --> 35:58.768
- Well, if it wasn't his,
then whose was it?

36:04.442 --> 36:06.109
- Teddy!

36:07.478 --> 36:09.713
Teddy, it's the police.
Open up!

36:21.926 --> 36:24.694
- Looks like Teddy took
his work home from the office.

36:24.695 --> 36:28.665
- He's been designing
his own line.

36:30.635 --> 36:33.737
- He was set to make three mil
off the I.P.O.

36:33.738 --> 36:37.274
It costs a lot more than that
to launch a line.

36:37.275 --> 36:41.411
No one would finance
the rest.

36:41.412 --> 36:43.480
- Has he shown up
at his office yet?

36:43.481 --> 36:45.148
- I tried the receptionist.

36:45.149 --> 36:49.085
Ten minutes ago, she said
she still hadn't seen him.

36:50.788 --> 36:55.458
- Let's lie.

36:55.459 --> 36:56.826
Hello.

36:56.827 --> 36:59.262
Hi, I'm looking
for Teddy scola.

36:59.263 --> 37:02.732
Yes, this is
Martin flom from Armani.

37:02.733 --> 37:04.234
Thank-

37:04.235 --> 37:07.637
Debra Brite told me about the
new line he's trying to launch.

37:07.638 --> 37:09.005
Yes.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.743
Yes, I'm only in town
for one day.

37:13.744 --> 37:15.345
Can I-

37:15.346 --> 37:17.147
absolutely.
I'll be there in 20.

37:17.148 --> 37:20.383
Thank you.

37:25.556 --> 37:27.123
- What the hell
are you doing here?

37:27.124 --> 37:28.124
- I have a meeting.

37:28.125 --> 37:30.560
- A meeting?
With who?

37:33.097 --> 37:35.131
- An investor.

37:35.132 --> 37:36.967
- An investor?
For this company?

37:36.968 --> 37:38.568
What the hell
are you talking about?

37:38.569 --> 37:41.838
- Remember that new line
I was telling you about?

37:41.839 --> 37:44.274
I finally finished
the samples.

37:44.275 --> 37:45.508
- Terrific.

37:45.509 --> 37:46.610
- Teddy?

37:46.611 --> 37:48.278
We need to talk.

37:48.279 --> 37:50.013
- Sorry, I have
an important meeting.

37:50.014 --> 37:51.948
- I know.

37:51.949 --> 37:55.552
Martin flom told me
all about it.

37:59.290 --> 38:03.293
You are the bad boy
of fashion.

38:03.294 --> 38:05.996
You are a-a-a genius.

38:05.997 --> 38:08.765
Teddy scola.

38:08.766 --> 38:12.102
A- ask me, this should
be your office, your chair.

38:14.138 --> 38:17.841
This is, uh, Nyle Brite's
famous plunge dress.

38:17.842 --> 38:19.476
- So simple-

38:19.477 --> 38:21.378
the draping in front,

38:21.379 --> 38:24.347
that elegant, daring plunge
in the back.

38:24.348 --> 38:28.351
- No wonder
he was a fashion icon.

38:30.588 --> 38:32.756
But he didn't design it.

38:35.059 --> 38:37.694
You did.

38:39.230 --> 38:41.731
It's right here
in your sketchbook.

38:41.732 --> 38:44.567
Famous plunge dress,
dated march 19, 2005.

38:44.568 --> 38:47.604
That's six months before
Nyle unveiled it in Milan.

38:47.605 --> 38:49.139
- Paris.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.573
- Sorry.

38:50.574 --> 38:53.143
Paris.

38:53.144 --> 38:55.278
And your new design...

38:55.279 --> 38:57.013
Spetto.

38:57.014 --> 39:01.117
Teddy, that's beautiful.

39:01.118 --> 39:03.586
- Nyle had charisma.

39:05.456 --> 39:08.158
I- I was just a schlep
from Jersey.

39:08.159 --> 39:10.927
He was the star. I was the-
- what?

39:10.928 --> 39:13.496
You were the...

39:13.497 --> 39:15.365
Fool?

39:15.366 --> 39:18.201
Part of the entourage,
you know, dumb friend?

39:18.202 --> 39:19.469
Dealer?

39:19.470 --> 39:21.371
Uh, pimp?

39:21.372 --> 39:23.606
You know what gets me
is that-

39:23.607 --> 39:26.309
that the two of you were-
you were real friends

39:26.310 --> 39:27.711
back in the day.

39:27.712 --> 39:31.614
You know, Norman Briteling
and Teddy scola.

39:31.615 --> 39:33.283
I- I looked it up-
the two of you went

39:33.284 --> 39:35.852
to the fashion institute
together after high school.

39:35.853 --> 39:36.953
- Yeah.

39:36.954 --> 39:38.955
- He loved you.
He trusted you.

39:38.956 --> 39:40.890
Took your advice.

39:40.891 --> 39:44.360
And you got perks-
sex, drugs, rock and roll.

39:44.361 --> 39:46.563
- How many times
did you ask Nyle

39:46.564 --> 39:48.565
to finance your own line?

39:48.566 --> 39:53.470
You were gonna make
$3 million from the I.P.O...

39:53.471 --> 39:56.706
Net after taxes, 1.5-
not chump change,

39:56.707 --> 39:58.374
but not enough
to launch a line.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.543
- Nyle didn't think
we were ready.

40:00.544 --> 40:03.813
He said my sample
was derivative.

40:03.814 --> 40:07.183
You believed that?

40:07.184 --> 40:09.853
Nyle telling me...

40:09.854 --> 40:11.321
That I'm derivative?

40:11.322 --> 40:13.523
- That prick.

40:15.025 --> 40:17.861
The guy
didn't appreciate anything.

40:17.862 --> 40:19.996
You know, you brought him Sara,
as a present,

40:19.997 --> 40:22.966
to the party,
a college girl.

40:22.967 --> 40:24.667
How were you gonna know

40:24.668 --> 40:27.370
that that was his daughter?

40:27.371 --> 40:29.506
- We didn't recognize
each other.

40:29.507 --> 40:31.508
I hadn't seen her
in nine years.

40:31.509 --> 40:33.076
- Nine years.

40:33.077 --> 40:34.644
He freaked out, you know?

40:34.645 --> 40:37.213
Later, they go to the apartment.
They fight.

40:37.214 --> 40:40.150
- What did she do
after he beat her?

40:40.151 --> 40:42.619
- She came to my place,
told me what he'd done.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.989
I never would have brought her
there if I knew who she was.

40:45.990 --> 40:48.258
- Was it her idea to blackmail
him, or was it yours,

40:48.259 --> 40:50.627
you know, to ensure
that he sponsor

40:50.628 --> 40:53.696
your own fashion line,

40:53.697 --> 40:55.165
you know, after the I.P.O.
Went through?

40:55.166 --> 40:57.100
- I busted hump
for this company.

40:57.101 --> 40:58.368
- Yes.
Yes, you did.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.370
- Every year, Nyle said,

41:00.371 --> 41:03.840
"you'll get your line, Teddy...

41:03.841 --> 41:06.109
Next year."

41:06.110 --> 41:09.913
And the next year
and then the next year

41:09.914 --> 41:13.783
and the year after that!

41:13.784 --> 41:16.920
- She sent him flowers...

41:16.921 --> 41:20.623
And then the note.

41:20.624 --> 41:22.859
But-but then what happened?

41:22.860 --> 41:24.594
I mean,
despite her anger,

41:24.595 --> 41:26.462
she couldn't blackmail
her father.

41:26.463 --> 41:28.064
She loved him, right?

41:28.065 --> 41:30.200
Blood's thicker.

41:30.201 --> 41:32.202
- That's why
she sent those texts-

41:32.203 --> 41:34.604
"I can't do this anymore.
I'm done."

41:37.441 --> 41:40.276
- As long
as you were number two,

41:40.277 --> 41:41.911
it was all good.

41:41.912 --> 41:44.581
He loved you.

41:44.582 --> 41:48.685
But he wasn't gonna let you
step into the sun...

41:48.686 --> 41:50.220
Right?

41:50.221 --> 41:51.621
He was the Mick Jagger,

41:51.622 --> 41:55.959
and you were, you know,
the faceless, silly, little guy,

41:55.960 --> 41:58.595
you know, backstage-
the one who brings you water.

41:58.596 --> 42:02.298
- I was more than that.

42:02.299 --> 42:04.567
- Is that how you came up
with the name "spetto"?

42:04.568 --> 42:09.038
Because you just shorten
the Italian word <i>rispetto...</i>

42:09.039 --> 42:13.176
Respect.

42:14.778 --> 42:17.981
- I love the sound of it.

42:17.982 --> 42:21.784
It's mysterious,
but it's strong.

42:23.921 --> 42:26.623
And it motivated me, too,

42:26.624 --> 42:28.324
knowing what the word
really meant.

42:28.325 --> 42:32.962
It helped me, you know,
fight through obstacles.

42:32.963 --> 42:34.397
- Like Sara.

42:34.398 --> 42:35.865
- I had no choice.

42:35.866 --> 42:39.302
She was gonna tell Nyle that
I was trying to blackmail him.

42:39.303 --> 42:41.104
He would've dumped me
in a heartbeat.

42:41.105 --> 42:43.973
- So you killed her
to keep your dream alive.

42:43.974 --> 42:45.275
And you killed him in anger,

42:45.276 --> 42:47.110
because he went
on national television

42:47.111 --> 42:48.578
and destroyed the company.

42:48.579 --> 42:51.014
- I-I didn't want to!
- No.

42:51.015 --> 42:53.650
- But I just-I...

42:53.651 --> 42:58.054
I just wanted my moment.

42:58.055 --> 43:00.490
- Well, you earned it.

43:00.491 --> 43:03.192
- I don't care
what anybody says.

43:07.998 --> 43:11.334
I was good.

43:11.335 --> 43:14.604
I really was.

43:14.605 --> 43:16.606
- Yeah, Teddy.

43:16.607 --> 43:20.009
You were better
than good.

43:23.113 --> 43:25.682
You were brilliant.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.921
But you had to kill...

43:31.922 --> 43:34.624
A father and a daughter

43:34.625 --> 43:37.260
for anyone to notice.

43:39.129 --> 43:40.663
- No.

43:40.664 --> 43:42.332
Come on!

43:42.333 --> 43:44.434
Come on, no!
