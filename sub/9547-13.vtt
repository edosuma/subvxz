00:08.353 --> 00:11.734
Can i eat these now ?
Cause nobody wants crumbs on the seat.

00:12.751 --> 00:13.986
- New car?
- Yep

00:15.616 --> 00:18.104
They finally signed off
on her last night.

00:18.210 --> 00:22.831
After about three years of begging
and pleading and weeping openly.

00:23.832 --> 00:25.356
What do you think of that color?

00:25.825 --> 00:26.834
You like it?

00:26.937 --> 00:28.363
I love that color.

00:29.098 --> 00:30.294
It's black, isn't it?

00:30.822 --> 00:32.578
No, it's Midnight Onyx.

00:34.085 --> 00:37.426
Yeah, it's got satellite radio.
Eight speakers.

00:37.886 --> 00:39.700
Randy, what the hell are you doing?

00:39.740 --> 00:41.721
You're getting salt all over the hood.

00:41.741 --> 00:44.102
- Does he remind you of anybody?
- No.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.379
You, you missed a spot there.

00:51.336 --> 00:52.646
You have the warrant?

00:52.666 --> 00:53.690
Right here.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.336
Okay,

00:55.986 --> 00:57.683
we're looking for a nine millimeter.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.397
Automatic, Monk thinks it's somewhere
in the building.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.350
We're gonna tear the place apart
top to bottom.

01:03.005 --> 01:04.007
Let's do it.

01:04.279 --> 01:05.283
Natalie,

01:05.476 --> 01:08.562
hang on to that radio.
We'll call you when the place is secure.

01:08.620 --> 01:09.482
Captain?

01:09.502 --> 01:12.294
- Yeah, hang on a minute.
- Captain, we need to do this.

01:12.314 --> 01:13.848
<i>Is that a scratch?</i>

01:13.978 --> 01:16.023
<i>- A little dirt?</i>
- No big deal.

01:16.384 --> 01:17.214
Here,

01:17.831 --> 01:20.112
keep on eye on her for me, will ya?

01:24.120 --> 01:26.678
Speaking of cars,
guess where Julie is today.

01:26.698 --> 01:28.463
- Yeah?
- Driver's ed.

01:28.528 --> 01:30.826
She's taking her test tomorrow.
Can you believe it?

01:31.500 --> 01:34.699
She wants me to get her a used car,
but I don't know what to do.

01:35.316 --> 01:37.746
Just say no.
You obviously can't afford it.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.316
Have you ever tried
saying no to a teenager?

01:41.336 --> 01:43.014
- How hard can it be?
- It's impossible.

01:43.034 --> 01:46.304
They're like a force of nature.
It's like walking into a hurricane.

01:46.324 --> 01:48.263
<i>Female caucasian, Julie Teeger.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:51.409
<i>Repeat, all units, possible 187.</i>

01:52.236 --> 01:54.870
The victim's name.
Repeat the victim's name.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.285
Julie Teeger.

01:56.305 --> 01:58.979
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, what's a 187?

01:59.582 --> 02:01.409
Mr. Monk, what's a 187?

02:01.887 --> 02:03.527
- Homicide.
- Oh my god!

02:03.566 --> 02:06.282
Just a second,
Natalie what are you doing

02:06.339 --> 02:09.550
Call a cab!
Wait! Wait for the cabtain.

03:27.579 --> 03:30.318
Julie, honey. Honey, it's me again.

03:30.338 --> 03:33.502
- Where are you? Just pick up, pick up!
- Sorry, I cannot let you go in there.

03:33.522 --> 03:36.372
I'm natalie teeger. I have to get
in there. No, I might be her mother.

03:42.786 --> 03:44.387
Oh, my god.

03:49.134 --> 03:50.137
Natalie.

03:50.428 --> 03:51.500
It's not her.

03:51.629 --> 03:52.710
It's not julie.

03:53.616 --> 03:54.619
Thank god.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.851
Another Julie Teeger.
What are the odds of that?

04:01.998 --> 04:04.236
Yeah, sorry about that.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.216
It's only a mirror.

04:09.722 --> 04:10.943
It's just the mirror.

04:11.569 --> 04:15.048
Leland, I'm so sorry. I heard the name,
and I just thought Julie...

04:15.068 --> 04:16.094
Natalie,

04:16.435 --> 04:18.517
any parent would have done
the same thing.

04:19.057 --> 04:20.079
Captain,

04:20.562 --> 04:22.875
Lieutenant Frank's inside.
He's the primary.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.926
He was wondering,
as long as we're here...

04:24.946 --> 04:26.662
Yeah, as long as we're here.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.341
I'm just gonna meet you inside.
I wanna hear Julie's voice.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.551
- I don't even use my side mirrors.
- Shut up.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.533
And you live right next door?

04:37.603 --> 04:38.603
That's right.

04:38.791 --> 04:40.393
I was taking a bath.

04:40.527 --> 04:41.776
My window was open.

04:41.796 --> 04:42.596
Cap.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.720
I heard screaming.

04:46.350 --> 04:47.624
It sounded like Julie.

04:47.872 --> 04:49.956
That's the victim, mrs. Teeger.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.491
<i>Did you hear anything else?</i>

04:51.549 --> 04:52.670
Just her screaming.

04:54.082 --> 04:55.760
Then maybe a car.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.612
I think I heard a car driving away.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.138
Okay,
screaming and then a car screeching off.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.010
- What then?
- Then I ran.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.772
- I came over here as soon as I could.
- How did you get in?

05:05.845 --> 05:07.523
The door was open.

05:08.136 --> 05:11.146
I knew there was something wrong.
Sometimes you can just tell.

05:12.234 --> 05:13.577
I found her

05:14.993 --> 05:16.722
in the foyer

05:16.849 --> 05:17.929
with that knife.

05:18.016 --> 05:20.463
Yeah, a steak knife
from a rack in the kitchen.

05:20.483 --> 05:21.569
Steak knife?

05:22.298 --> 05:25.144
We-we-we gave her those knives.

05:25.164 --> 05:26.203
For christmas.

05:26.223 --> 05:28.102
Sir, would you like to sit down?

05:28.122 --> 05:32.382
Hold on, let me...
Let me move this stuff here.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.827
Look at the size of that handkerchief.

05:39.761 --> 05:42.269
Monk, that's not a handkerchief.
That's somebody's underwear.

05:43.138 --> 05:46.297
Hey hey hey hey!

05:46.317 --> 05:48.044
- Hey hey!
- He hates underwear?

05:48.064 --> 05:49.055
Yes.

05:51.261 --> 05:52.389
There you go.

05:52.427 --> 05:54.905
Thank you. Thank you.

05:57.016 --> 05:59.061
Julie! Julie!

05:59.128 --> 06:01.342
- Oh, my god, no!
- Hey hey hey!

06:01.458 --> 06:04.113
Just calm down! This is a crime scene.
Just calm down.

06:04.158 --> 06:06.049
A crime scene? That's my wife!

06:11.110 --> 06:12.190
What happened?

06:12.710 --> 06:14.272
We're not sure.

06:14.324 --> 06:16.644
We think maybe
she interrupted a Burglary.

06:17.882 --> 06:18.882
A Burglary?

06:19.771 --> 06:21.141
In broad daylight?

06:24.589 --> 06:25.669
Who did this?

06:29.110 --> 06:30.557
You find out who did this.

06:32.229 --> 06:33.232
I will.

06:33.544 --> 06:34.885
You have my word.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.642
It's me again.
Please, I need to hear your voice.

06:43.662 --> 06:45.552
Call me when you get this.

06:48.427 --> 06:51.494
<i>Tentative id on the victim
is Julie Teeger.</i>

06:51.703 --> 06:53.877
<i>Unit nine, could you repeat
the name of the victim?</i>

06:53.897 --> 06:55.315
<i>Julie teeger.</i>

06:55.335 --> 06:57.274
<i>That's t for thomas. Teeger.</i>

06:57.294 --> 07:00.662
Nine, this has gotta be a mix-up. We're
at the teeger scene on bose street.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.677
<i>I don't know what to tell you, buddy.</i>
<i>I'm looking at her I.D. Right now.</i>

07:03.697 --> 07:06.216
Julie Teeger. The picture matches.

07:06.277 --> 07:08.129
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.101
Natalie!

07:14.798 --> 07:15.801
Natalie!

07:17.919 --> 07:19.655
What the hell's her problem?

07:30.143 --> 07:31.802
It's not her. It's not her.

07:32.570 --> 07:35.158
- Another Julie Teeger?
- It's impossible.

07:35.611 --> 07:37.868
- Very nearly.
- But this one is totally different.

07:37.888 --> 07:39.866
It was an accident.
She was a graduate student.

07:39.886 --> 07:42.201
She was on her bike.
Probably riding home.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.360
And some guy hit her
and just kept on going.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.847
But her name-her name is definitely
Julie Teeger, spelled the same?

07:47.867 --> 07:50.474
Actually, these kind of things
happen all the time.

07:50.494 --> 07:54.238
I once took this course in statistics.
There was this woman in Michigan.

07:54.571 --> 07:55.718
She won the lottery.

07:55.738 --> 07:57.599
Next day she got bit by a Shark.

07:58.718 --> 08:00.184
And what does that prove?

08:01.432 --> 08:03.728
I don't know.
I ended up dropping the class.

08:14.213 --> 08:15.525
What the hell happened?

08:15.852 --> 08:17.221
It was only two miles.

08:17.553 --> 08:20.736
I took a short cut.
I cut across the creek.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.236
There's no bridge across the creek.

08:25.054 --> 08:26.054
I know.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.353
There's no bridge across the creek.

08:29.454 --> 08:30.631
Yes, I know.

08:31.713 --> 08:33.371
There's no bridge across the creek.

08:33.549 --> 08:36.640
Captain, I am sorry.
I will pay for everything.

08:38.342 --> 08:39.379
No, it's okay.

08:40.664 --> 08:41.823
It's insured.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.635
Yeah, remember, sir, you did say

08:43.655 --> 08:45.588
that any parent
would have done the same thing.

08:48.727 --> 08:50.405
I think I need to be alone.

08:50.769 --> 08:51.772
Here.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.253
<i>What is it?</i>

09:04.552 --> 09:05.552
Her bike.

09:06.654 --> 09:08.352
She has all the safety features.

09:08.609 --> 09:10.943
Flashers, two mirrors.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.050
She was obviously very careful.

09:13.382 --> 09:14.192
So?

09:15.367 --> 09:17.740
So what was she doing
on the wrong side of the road?

10:07.322 --> 10:08.036
Monk.

10:08.461 --> 10:09.676
<i>Check this out.</i>

10:10.306 --> 10:11.385
What is it?

10:11.641 --> 10:13.185
This bruise, it's square.

10:20.434 --> 10:22.929
It's from a trailer hitch.
Cap.

10:23.897 --> 10:25.164
He chased her...

10:25.184 --> 10:26.698
Across the park.

10:27.803 --> 10:28.920
He hit her.

10:30.606 --> 10:33.075
And then he backed up
to finish the her off.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.423
He backed up?

10:34.730 --> 10:35.984
He ran her over.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.331
This was no accident.

10:38.351 --> 10:41.425
They're two homicides.
Same name on the Same day.

10:42.898 --> 10:45.625
Is somebody killing Julie Teegers?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.573
Oh, my god.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.433
Oh, my god.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.917
Mss Teegers, what are you doing?

10:55.533 --> 10:56.536
Turning.

10:56.861 --> 10:59.620
I could have sworn
we just passed a stop sign.

10:59.656 --> 11:01.818
But I must have been imagining things.

11:01.838 --> 11:03.213
Just pull over.

11:04.399 --> 11:06.502
Sorry, I didn't see it.

11:06.898 --> 11:10.081
I can understand that.
They hid it so cleverly.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.999
On top of that big post.

11:15.157 --> 11:18.347
All right, Miss teeger, let's
be adventurous.

11:18.402 --> 11:21.106
Let's try a three point turn.
Now, what's the first thing you do?

11:21.658 --> 11:22.558
Pray.

11:23.386 --> 11:26.550
I'm, i'm, just kidding. That was a joke.

11:26.650 --> 11:29.819
You might want to save all your prayers
for your driving test tomorrow.

11:31.879 --> 11:33.885
<i>Okay. The tree pointer</i>

11:34.449 --> 11:35.452
Hold it!

11:35.983 --> 11:37.141
What'd you forget?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.183
Your blinker.

11:40.590 --> 11:41.419
Well...

11:42.456 --> 11:46.699
Is that a big deal? I mean...
there's nobody around.

11:52.148 --> 11:53.267
Okay, okay.

11:53.409 --> 11:55.456
I'm using my blinker!

11:55.476 --> 11:56.858
<i>My blinker is on!</i>

11:58.777 --> 12:00.783
Thank god, Julie. Honey honey!

12:01.291 --> 12:04.416
You have to come with us right now!

12:04.841 --> 12:07.060
<i>- What's going on?
- Sorry, sorry.</i>

12:07.425 --> 12:10.426
Oh, my god! It was just a blinker!

12:14.562 --> 12:15.642
She's okay.

12:16.289 --> 12:19.807
She's fine. Natalie just picked her up.
She's heading home.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.830
I want a car outside of her house 24/7.

12:22.925 --> 12:25.908
Make it two cars.
And a uniform at her back door.

12:25.956 --> 12:28.355
Course she's gonna feel sorry for him
and invite him in.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.502
Tell him to stay outside
and to stay sharp.

12:31.165 --> 12:33.398
How many Julie Teegers
do you think there could be?

12:33.418 --> 12:36.140
I have no idea.
We're checking the phone directories.

12:36.272 --> 12:39.060
What about children?
They wouldn't all be listed.

12:39.861 --> 12:43.462
That's true. Check the schools,
public and private, and birth records.

12:43.559 --> 12:44.622
<i>The whole country?</i>

12:44.642 --> 12:46.627
Start in California.
Work your way up the coast

12:46.647 --> 12:49.497
What about women who are married
who changed their names?

12:49.517 --> 12:51.193
He's right. Call social security.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.545
- You got it. When you do want it?
- How about now?

12:54.124 --> 12:55.226
How about tonight?

12:55.284 --> 12:56.654
How about you get busy?

12:58.785 --> 13:00.115
Any ideas?

13:01.464 --> 13:02.641
I don't know.

13:03.313 --> 13:04.879
I don't know. All right,

13:05.283 --> 13:06.453
okay,

13:08.415 --> 13:11.251
maybe a hit man was paid
to kill julie teeger.

13:11.669 --> 13:13.323
But he doesn't know what she looks like.

13:13.343 --> 13:15.041
And he's killing all of them?

13:15.278 --> 13:18.487
Monk, that doesn't track.
The m.o.'s are so different.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.821
The housewife was stabbed
and the graduate student was run down.

13:21.841 --> 13:24.787
I know. It doesn't make any sense.
Okay, forget it.

13:24.807 --> 13:25.907
- Captain?
- Yeah.

13:25.927 --> 13:28.629
Hey, Monk, I've got two ideas.

13:28.649 --> 13:30.706
- Two ideas?
- Yeah, which one do you want first?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.692
The one that'll make me less pissed off.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.937
Theory a.

13:35.497 --> 13:38.042
I remembered this old case,
Matthew Teeger.

13:38.062 --> 13:39.237
35 years old.

13:39.257 --> 13:42.473
Guy's been committed twice for
acute schizophrenia and delusions.

13:42.493 --> 13:43.973
- Any arrests?
- Yeah.

13:43.993 --> 13:46.640
Assault three years ago.
He attacked his stepfather.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.481
He said he was defending his mother.

13:48.823 --> 13:51.196
Apparently he's obsessed with her.
Guess what her name is?

13:52.593 --> 13:54.675
Juliet Teeger.

13:54.886 --> 13:58.171
A history of violence
and a mother of a psycho

13:58.194 --> 14:00.914
- I like it.
- I like it too, we'll talk to this guy.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.785
What about the other idea?
Said you had two.

14:02.805 --> 14:04.391
Yeah, it's just a long shot.

14:05.613 --> 14:06.828
<i>The Terminator?</i>

14:06.912 --> 14:08.522
Yeah, just brainstorming, you know?

14:08.542 --> 14:11.732
You think he might be a robot assassin
sent from the future?

14:11.752 --> 14:14.922
Well, he was killing women
with the same names. Forget it.

14:15.346 --> 14:17.601
Sarah connor, come with me
if you want to live.

14:17.679 --> 14:19.086
<i>That was T.2.</i>

14:19.818 --> 14:23.534
Maybe we could lure him to a smelting
plant on the outskirts of town.

14:23.554 --> 14:26.254
- Can I have that back, please?
- <i>And things of this nature.</i>

14:35.142 --> 14:36.415
What is that dump?

14:36.679 --> 14:38.948
But you can tell it used
to be beautilful.

14:38.968 --> 14:41.253
How could something like this happen?

14:41.273 --> 14:44.621
I don't know,
maybe Natalie drove it sometimes.

14:51.858 --> 14:52.939
Hello?

14:53.497 --> 14:54.614
Mrs. Teeger?

14:56.394 --> 14:57.492
You all right?

15:01.328 --> 15:04.275
We're with the police department, ma'am.
We've been trying to reach you.

15:05.164 --> 15:07.672
We have reason to believe
you may be in some danger!

15:08.598 --> 15:09.426
Hello?

15:10.652 --> 15:11.964
Mrs. Teeger?

15:15.528 --> 15:16.917
Taxidermy.

15:19.097 --> 15:20.717
It's nice to have a hobby.

15:36.049 --> 15:38.422
Can't imagine growing up
in a house like this.

15:38.721 --> 15:39.724
I can.

15:49.424 --> 15:50.909
All right, let's spread out.

15:51.077 --> 15:52.105
Randy,

15:52.767 --> 15:55.087
check out back. Check the basement.

15:55.303 --> 15:56.923
Monk, you check upstairs.

16:35.707 --> 16:36.707
Mrs. Teeger?

16:40.564 --> 16:41.587
Juliet?

16:47.150 --> 16:48.346
Don't be afraid.

16:49.546 --> 16:51.083
I'm with the,

16:51.806 --> 16:53.080
I'm with the police.

16:55.739 --> 16:57.587
We think young matthew might

16:58.536 --> 17:00.336
be involved something.

17:02.845 --> 17:04.483
Do you know where he is, m'am?

17:05.522 --> 17:07.067
We just want to talk to him.

17:09.670 --> 17:10.712
M'am.

17:13.798 --> 17:15.419
Have you...
Excuse me?

17:18.906 --> 17:20.161
Are you...
Are you ok?

17:24.590 --> 17:25.594
Are you?

17:25.983 --> 17:27.257
Are you dad?

17:38.298 --> 17:40.998
Please be alive. Please be alive.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.041
Please be alive.

17:42.602 --> 17:43.602
Please

17:44.076 --> 17:47.027
Please don't be one
of those skeleton ladies.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.047
Please be alive. Please be alive.

17:56.173 --> 17:58.797
Please be dead. Please be dead.

18:01.227 --> 18:02.848
I just wanna thank you again

18:03.157 --> 18:05.036
for seeing me on such short notice.

18:05.924 --> 18:07.101
Were you sleeping?

18:07.499 --> 18:08.810
No, not no.

18:09.583 --> 18:10.697
Happy to do it.

18:11.202 --> 18:13.969
Your wife wasn't too happy.
I could hear her in the background

18:13.989 --> 18:15.608
No, Madeline is spying,

18:15.735 --> 18:18.180
part of the job, and she knows that.

18:18.762 --> 18:20.421
Does she have tourette's syndrome?

18:22.771 --> 18:23.850
Yes.

18:24.411 --> 18:25.491
Yes, she does.

18:26.926 --> 18:27.748
So,

18:28.662 --> 18:30.206
a glass eyeball?

18:30.727 --> 18:33.982
The mother died three months ago.
The son never reported it.

18:34.387 --> 18:36.316
Wait, did the son kill the mother?

18:36.336 --> 18:38.949
The doctors say no.
It was a heart aneurysm.

18:39.317 --> 18:42.896
Her son, Matthew,
is an amateur taxidermist.

18:43.005 --> 18:45.152
He stuffed her body.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.352
Carried her from room to room
like nothing happened.

18:48.372 --> 18:51.509
Yeah, I have heard of cases like that.
See,

18:51.876 --> 18:53.767
he couldn't function without her.

18:53.988 --> 18:58.019
They call it...
Radical cognitive bonding.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.430
At least I never
dug Trudy up

19:01.912 --> 19:03.929
and had her stuffed and mounted, right?

19:04.057 --> 19:06.565
Yes, and I've always been very proud
of you for that.

19:06.828 --> 19:07.928
Thank you.

19:08.353 --> 19:11.555
So, the son. Where is the son?

19:11.608 --> 19:12.920
That's the problem.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.506
He just disappeared.

19:14.526 --> 19:17.755
Do you think he's tracking down women
who have the same name as his mother,

19:17.775 --> 19:19.623
- Julie Teeger?
- Is that possible?

19:19.646 --> 19:22.430
Yes, Adrian, anything is possible,
unfortunately.

19:22.450 --> 19:25.479
You know,
Natalie must be scared to death.

19:25.733 --> 19:29.318
I brought his file with me.
Hoping you could take a look at it.

19:29.452 --> 19:33.141
Adrian, remember, this isn't a patient
of mine. I have never met this man.

19:33.161 --> 19:35.379
So I could only make an educated guess.

19:35.399 --> 19:36.492
We'll take it.

20:28.308 --> 20:29.176
I know.

20:29.234 --> 20:31.906
They have been parked out front
all night.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.911
And lieutenant Disher
is in our living room.

20:34.029 --> 20:35.958
I feel like i'm in a Spy movie.

20:36.245 --> 20:37.750
Julie, what are you doing?

20:38.069 --> 20:39.060
Talking to Katie.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.634
I told you to stay away from the window.
This is not a game.

20:41.799 --> 20:46.158
Katie, I better go. My mom is having
an anxiety attack.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.698
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- And no headphones.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.811
- Why not?
- I want you to be able to hear me

20:50.868 --> 20:52.353
if something happens.

20:52.423 --> 20:54.346
Mom, I really think you're overreacting.

20:54.366 --> 20:56.820
Well, that's my job.
So let me just do my job.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.510
Wh-what's this?

20:59.050 --> 21:02.870
Oh, it's your homework. I had
the officers pick it up from school.

21:02.954 --> 21:03.967
What?

21:05.237 --> 21:06.646
I can't go to school?

21:06.901 --> 21:09.968
So now I'm a prisoner in my own house.

21:10.707 --> 21:13.623
Why?
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:13.643 --> 21:14.782
It's not fair.

21:14.852 --> 21:17.013
I know, honey. It's not

21:17.430 --> 21:18.509
Well, for how long?

21:18.571 --> 21:20.617
I don't know.
Just until they catch this guy.

21:20.637 --> 21:23.388
Mr. Monk and the whole department
are out there looking for him.

21:23.551 --> 21:25.075
Well, what about my driver's test?

21:25.335 --> 21:27.662
Well, we might have
to reschedule that, okay?

21:27.682 --> 21:28.889
No. No no no.

21:29.178 --> 21:31.367
I have been waiting my whole life
to get my license.

21:31.387 --> 21:32.974
Honey, I don't think you appreciate

21:32.994 --> 21:35.339
how serious this situation is.

21:35.359 --> 21:38.165
I don't think you appreciate this.
I am taking that test tomorrow

21:38.185 --> 21:40.011
with or without your permission.

21:46.035 --> 21:47.115
How's she doing?

21:47.695 --> 21:49.510
There are two dead women
named Julie Teeger

21:49.530 --> 21:51.889
and all she cares about
is her driver's test.

21:54.529 --> 21:55.803
Well, maybe it's healthy.

21:56.447 --> 21:59.108
- She's living her life.
- Yeah, meanwhile I'm a wreck.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.902
Vanilla fudge, my favorite.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.750
Yeah, I know.
I got it from your freezer.

22:08.854 --> 22:10.803
Randy, I need to ask you a favor.

22:11.555 --> 22:13.320
- The answer is yes.
- I need a gun.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.263
-  The answer is no.
- I know how to use it.

22:15.283 --> 22:18.334
When we lived on the base, mitch took
me to the firing range all the time.

22:18.354 --> 22:19.640
So apply for a permit.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.834
No, I cannot wait two weeks.
I need something now.

22:21.854 --> 22:26.014
I need something in my hand. I just
feel so helpless sitting here waiting.

22:26.085 --> 22:28.327
Well, she's gonna be okay. I mean,

22:28.423 --> 22:29.774
I'm right here, so...

22:30.559 --> 22:31.986
Nothing's gonna happen.

22:35.944 --> 22:37.063
She asleep?

22:38.269 --> 22:39.591
- No, not yet.
- Good,

22:39.611 --> 22:43.049
let's pack her up. There's a room at the
police station, with a couple of beds.

22:43.069 --> 22:44.724
<i>The tv and you'll have her own bathroom.</i>

22:44.744 --> 22:47.310
- What happened?
- Nothing I'm being careful, that's all.

22:47.330 --> 22:50.119
Captain, something happened, you have
to tell me. I'm her mother.

22:50.988 --> 22:52.047
All right.

22:54.131 --> 22:56.369
I thought it was a fairly common name.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.145
I thought there'd be a hundred others.
We checked Nevada, Oregon.

22:59.165 --> 23:01.475
- Went as far east as Colorado.
- And?

23:01.495 --> 23:04.513
And she's the only Julie Teeger
within a thousand miles.

23:05.674 --> 23:07.371
You mean the only one left.

23:21.797 --> 23:22.934
Tape is rolling.

23:26.066 --> 23:27.474
Could you hand me a kleenex?

23:29.983 --> 23:33.234
Kills 99.9% of cold and flu viruses.

23:34.039 --> 23:35.331
Only 99.9.

23:37.403 --> 23:38.734
<i>Randy, what are you doing?</i>

23:40.801 --> 23:43.298
<i>My bra's itching.
How do they walk around in this stuff?</i>

23:43.950 --> 23:45.262
<i>This is a new low.</i>

23:45.584 --> 23:47.744
<i>Actually, it's not a new low.</i>

23:48.089 --> 23:49.536
<i>That's the sad part.</i>

23:51.568 --> 23:52.939
<i>He's never gonna buy this.</i>

23:52.959 --> 23:54.815
<i>Dr. Kroger thinks he will.</i>

23:55.124 --> 23:56.807
<i>Matthew Teeger has suffered a pure</i>

23:56.827 --> 23:58.975
<i>psychotic break.
He's in complete denial.</i>

23:59.107 --> 24:01.036
<i>His mother never died. Not to him.</i>

24:01.103 --> 24:03.225
<i>The important thing is that
we keep him talking.</i>

24:03.901 --> 24:05.078
<i>What if he has a knife?</i>

24:06.462 --> 24:07.477
<i>He's right.</i>

24:07.497 --> 24:10.004
<i>We need a code, a phrase,
in case he's in trouble.</i>

24:10.982 --> 24:13.103
<i>How about mother of god, he has a knife?</i>

24:13.222 --> 24:14.666
<i>No, it needs to be covert.</i>

24:14.724 --> 24:17.423
<i>It needs to be conversational.
Sound natural.</i>

24:18.179 --> 24:19.188
<i>How about,</i>

24:19.491 --> 24:21.324
<i>"i wish there were ten of them"?</i>

24:22.724 --> 24:24.303
- Ten of what?
- Anything.

24:25.147 --> 24:28.136
Well, you see, Monk, I don't think
anybody else would actually say that.

24:28.515 --> 24:29.904
<i>I've heard people say that.</i>

24:30.265 --> 24:32.043
<i>Okay, look, here's the code.</i>

24:32.985 --> 24:34.441
<i>Better late than never.</i>

24:35.358 --> 24:36.443
<i>Yep, got it.</i>

24:36.877 --> 24:38.737
<i>You want to write it down?
No no, I'm good.</i>

24:38.757 --> 24:39.850
<i>Okay, what is it?</i>

24:40.873 --> 24:41.720
<i>It's...</i>

24:41.816 --> 24:44.078
- <i>Better Late than never.
- Yeah, I got it, no problem.</i>

24:44.206 --> 24:45.826
<i>The suspect is approaching the house.</i>

24:45.878 --> 24:47.973
<i>He's entering through the back door.
- All right, </i>

24:48.416 --> 24:50.172
<i>everybody wait for my signal.</i>

25:03.070 --> 25:04.074
Hi, mama.

25:07.137 --> 25:08.256
I'm sorry I'm late.

25:08.276 --> 25:10.951
I came by earlier,
there were policemen everywhere.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.120
Yes,

25:12.563 --> 25:15.167
they were looking for you, Matthew.

25:17.715 --> 25:18.901
Have burnt out again.

25:18.921 --> 25:21.458
-  I'll get another one.
- No no no no no, leave it, leave it.

25:21.510 --> 25:23.555
How the light hurts my eyes.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.381
Are you okay, mama?

25:25.903 --> 25:27.350
I've been crying.

25:27.436 --> 25:29.751
Crying about you, Matthew.

25:30.669 --> 25:31.707
The police,

25:31.960 --> 25:34.222
<i>said that you've been a bad boy.</i>

25:35.189 --> 25:37.851
Have you been doing something
you shouldn't?

25:38.439 --> 25:39.885
I don't wanna talk about it.

25:40.105 --> 25:43.671
- They said that you've hurt some.
- I said I don't wanna talk <i>about it!</i>

25:45.768 --> 25:47.253
I try to be good,

25:47.928 --> 25:49.317
mama. I do.

25:50.661 --> 25:51.915
But it's so hard.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.255
I need some sugar.

25:54.855 --> 25:58.067
- Well, you could chek the kitchen.
- I need some sugar, mama.

25:58.087 --> 25:59.234
Give me some sugar.

25:59.254 --> 26:00.074
Sugar?

26:01.214 --> 26:04.374
- What are you doing? I have a cold.
- Don't... Hold me.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.265
Please just hold me.

26:07.328 --> 26:10.383
- There there.
- I've been a bad boy.

26:10.709 --> 26:13.738
<i>First come,
first served.</i>

26:13.949 --> 26:15.985
<i>Out of sight, out of mind.</i>

26:16.216 --> 26:17.955
<i>There there.
Blood is thicker than water.</i>

26:17.994 --> 26:19.646
What are you doing?
- nothing. Mommy's

26:19.695 --> 26:21.930
just trying to remember something, dear.

26:22.211 --> 26:25.946
<i>I wish there were ten of them.
Repeat, I wish there were ten of them.</i>

26:26.142 --> 26:27.879
That's close enough. Let's go.

26:28.103 --> 26:30.785
<i>Please, just hold me.</i>
I've been a bad boy!

26:39.810 --> 26:41.662
Clean spoon. It's a miracle.

26:44.413 --> 26:46.788
Harriet Teeger, Holda Teeger?

26:47.658 --> 26:48.795
I like Holda.

26:48.947 --> 26:51.050
It's Scandinavian. It means lovable.

26:51.311 --> 26:52.932
Wait, you want to change your name?

26:53.472 --> 26:54.472
Wouldn't you?

26:54.722 --> 26:57.829
Well, honey, i want you to be safe.
That's what's most important.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.975
But I don't want this creep to change
who we are or how we live.

27:01.772 --> 27:02.851
It's just a name.

27:03.914 --> 27:04.918
You know,

27:05.419 --> 27:07.792
naming you Julie was your dad's idea.

27:08.093 --> 27:08.903
I know.

27:09.080 --> 27:09.968
Aunt Julie.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.254
Yeah, but she wasn't just his favorite
aunt. She was an amazing

27:13.370 --> 27:17.147
person. She was one of the first female
war correspondents. She was in Vietnam.

27:17.186 --> 27:18.536
She was fearless.

27:18.685 --> 27:20.769
Plus, she practically raised your dad.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.234
I think it's a beautiful name.
It suits you.

27:24.327 --> 27:25.562
Come on, let's keep it.

27:25.639 --> 27:26.730
Okay. Okay.

27:26.927 --> 27:28.875
Besides, Holda Teeger?

27:31.498 --> 27:33.494
It's all over.
We got him.

27:33.546 --> 27:34.636
Thank god!

27:34.656 --> 27:36.252
They're bringing him in right now.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.000
- See?
- Is that him?

27:38.367 --> 27:39.367
<i>That's him.</i>

27:40.490 --> 27:41.956
<i>And that's his mother.</i>

27:43.345 --> 27:45.641
You said they caught him,
I could take my driver's test.

27:45.679 --> 27:46.846
No, I said maybe. Mom.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.720
Okay, let's just leave it up to Mr.
Monk. If he says it's okay, you can go.

27:51.026 --> 27:53.745
No no, don't drag me into this.

27:53.823 --> 27:56.348
As you may recall, I have enough
problems of my own.

27:56.386 --> 27:59.244
Well, now you have another one.
All right, I gotta go call my parents.

27:59.294 --> 28:01.885
- They've been worried sick.
- Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, please.

28:01.905 --> 28:04.178
I'm begging you.
Mr. Monk, I am begging you.

28:04.198 --> 28:06.214
Julie, look, he's just a suspect.

28:06.327 --> 28:08.558
Listen to me, we haven't
even question end him yet.

28:08.578 --> 28:09.883
Mr. Monk, he's the guy.

28:09.903 --> 28:12.077
When you came in,
you said it was all over.

28:12.155 --> 28:14.404
Well, it sounded good.
I wanted to make a big entrance.

28:14.424 --> 28:16.456
Look, let me think about it, okay?

28:16.521 --> 28:19.066
Mr. Monk, he's in jail.
He can't do anything now.

28:19.143 --> 28:20.619
Yeah, you know, I'm busy.

28:20.639 --> 28:23.976
I got a lot of things to do.
I got all these yellow pencils.

28:24.034 --> 28:26.153
Everybody's driving. All of my friends.

28:26.173 --> 28:28.195
I think you were a kid once,
weren't you?

28:28.262 --> 28:29.370
Very briefly.

28:29.682 --> 28:31.284
Then you remember what it's like.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.937
I'm just trying to fit in, Mr. Monk.
I just wanna be normal.

28:34.568 --> 28:36.169
Why don't you talk to the captain?

28:36.432 --> 28:38.516
No, not my jurisdiction.

28:38.555 --> 28:41.196
Mr. Monk, the DMV is four blocks away
on Vinton street.

28:41.216 --> 28:43.234
And if I leave now,
I still might make it.

28:43.354 --> 28:46.625
Please, Mr. Monk, look into your heart.
I am begging you.

28:46.696 --> 28:48.232
Are you Julie Teeger?

28:51.399 --> 28:52.816
<i>That's my mother's name.</i>

28:52.925 --> 28:56.764
- Hey, get him the hell out of here.
- You better be careful, Julie Teeger.

29:00.393 --> 29:01.396
Are you okay?

29:04.926 --> 29:07.742
Oh, my god. He is so the guy.

29:08.225 --> 29:10.069
That was, like, a confession. So

29:10.223 --> 29:12.441
So I can go now, right?
Mr. Monk,

29:12.692 --> 29:16.213
- say yes. Say yes. Say yes.
- Julie, how are you gonna get there?

29:16.517 --> 29:18.176
Your mother can't just leave.

29:18.471 --> 29:19.706
I could drive her over.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.958
She could drive me over.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.217
Yeah, fine. Okay, good, yeah.

29:26.237 --> 29:28.315
Thank you so much!

29:28.415 --> 29:30.981
Thank you so much, Mr. Monk.

29:31.449 --> 29:33.110
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.889
- Okay, good.
- Thank you, thank you.

29:34.965 --> 29:36.257
But! Thank you.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.167
Where's the girl?

29:39.922 --> 29:42.750
The one I was talking to.
I think she's in trouble.

29:42.834 --> 29:44.204
Matthew, listen to me.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.477
You've got other things
to worry about right now.

29:46.497 --> 29:50.108
You told my partner you'd been
a bad boy. We have it on tape.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.390
I was talking to some girls in the park.

29:52.474 --> 29:53.593
That's what I meant.

29:54.123 --> 29:55.926
Mama doesn't like when I talk to girls.

29:55.946 --> 29:57.468
You were more than talking.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.265
You hurt them, didn't you?

30:00.619 --> 30:03.488
There were two women
had the same name as your mother.

30:03.579 --> 30:05.720
<i>No, I wouldn't hurt anybody.</i>

30:06.051 --> 30:07.729
<i>Talk to my mother. She'll tell you.</i>

30:08.613 --> 30:09.655
Where is she?

30:10.439 --> 30:11.754
What did you do with her?

30:12.620 --> 30:13.830
So you love your mother.

30:13.928 --> 30:14.797
Yes.

30:16.753 --> 30:18.594
- I don't think so.
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>

30:18.614 --> 30:20.147
No, I think you hate your mother.

30:20.167 --> 30:23.027
<i>- No, I don't. You hate your mother.</i>
- You hate your mother so much

30:23.071 --> 30:25.545
you've been running around town killing
and over again!

30:25.565 --> 30:28.157
No you're making me sound crazy.
I'm not crazy!

30:28.219 --> 30:29.407
Where's my mother?

30:29.507 --> 30:30.809
Where's my mother?

30:36.019 --> 30:37.117
Where's my mother?

30:39.770 --> 30:40.966
I want my mother.

30:45.349 --> 30:46.468
Whatcha got there?

30:46.692 --> 30:48.274
My rabbit's foot. It protects me.

30:48.837 --> 30:51.452
Right, well, you're gonna need it.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.945
You drive a Nissan pickup truck,
don't you?

30:54.279 --> 30:55.946
It has a trailer hitch, right?

30:58.408 --> 31:00.176
- I don't know. I guess so.
- Yeah.

31:01.571 --> 31:04.729
And I believe this is your knife.
We found it in your boot.

31:05.598 --> 31:06.426
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:07.038 --> 31:09.580
<i>I always wear that.
I've had it my whole life.</i>

31:10.154 --> 31:11.732
<i>I used to get teased a lot.</i>

31:13.896 --> 31:15.015
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

31:15.110 --> 31:16.456
<i>If you don't believe me...</i>

31:16.494 --> 31:18.192
<i>- Ask my mother.
- Ask your mother.</i>

31:20.449 --> 31:21.934
He had a knife?

31:21.977 --> 31:23.288
Strapped to his leg.

31:23.508 --> 31:24.838
Randy, victim...

31:25.800 --> 31:28.038
Victim one was killed
with a steak knife.

31:28.427 --> 31:30.901
I don't know.
I mean, he's a knife freak.

31:30.996 --> 31:32.875
Didn't wanna get his own knife dirty.

31:32.931 --> 31:34.976
I mean, Monk, the guy's certifiable.

31:35.178 --> 31:36.476
Thought I was his mother.

31:36.530 --> 31:37.957
He's crazier than you.

31:38.930 --> 31:39.740
Grant.

31:40.114 --> 31:42.419
Hugh Grant. You know him. That actor?

31:42.439 --> 31:43.541
The crazy actor.

31:45.377 --> 31:46.901
Four weddings and a funeral.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.246
Morning, Miss Teeger.

31:55.589 --> 31:56.688
Mr. Carlson.

31:56.938 --> 31:58.269
Do you have your permit?

32:14.917 --> 32:16.112
There you go.

32:18.721 --> 32:20.436
That was something, wasn't it?

32:21.416 --> 32:25.265
I'm not usually a fan of the insanity
defense, but in this case...

32:25.901 --> 32:27.995
It's just creepy the way he talked
to Julie.

32:28.015 --> 32:29.023
Get down.

32:31.916 --> 32:32.978
Stay down!

32:41.570 --> 32:44.805
He's gone, Captain. We were leading
him out. He grabbed Hartman's weapon.

32:44.891 --> 32:46.492
- Who's gone?
- Your guy.

32:46.937 --> 32:48.861
- Teeger.
- Oh, my god.

32:49.283 --> 32:50.497
Oh, my god.

32:52.847 --> 32:55.219
Pick up. Pick up, Julie. Pick up.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.286
<i>- Yeah,</i>
- He stop a Pick up.

32:57.306 --> 33:00.219
<i>He stole a pizza delivery truck.
He's heading west towards the plaza.</i>

33:00.239 --> 33:03.211
I'm leaving with Natalie right now.
We gotta make sure her kid's okay.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.867
Hey, my car's right out front.

33:04.924 --> 33:06.655
- I'll drive.
- I don't think so.

33:06.682 --> 33:07.994
Where the hell is Monk?

33:10.132 --> 33:11.279
Julie Teeger?

33:11.299 --> 33:14.040
She was probably one of the best tenants
I ever had.

33:14.332 --> 33:16.194
Who would do a thing like that?

33:16.272 --> 33:19.398
Run over a girl on her bicycle
and just keep going?

33:19.730 --> 33:21.138
I don't know, ma'am.

33:36.839 --> 33:38.678
You were told to turn that off.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.530
It's my mother.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.286
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm turning it off.

33:55.441 --> 33:56.878
A lot of packages.

33:56.898 --> 33:59.145
She got deliveries all the time.

33:59.260 --> 34:00.260
From the ebay.

34:09.731 --> 34:11.024
There's a box missing.

34:12.308 --> 34:13.425
A yellow one.

34:14.047 --> 34:15.047
Excuse me.

34:15.290 --> 34:16.114
<i>Disher.</i>

34:16.134 --> 34:18.170
Did she get a delivery on thursday?

34:18.327 --> 34:19.600
The day she passed?

34:20.103 --> 34:22.320
Now that you mention it,
I think she did.

34:22.782 --> 34:25.451
Monk, Matthew Teeger just bolted.
We gotta roll.

34:34.830 --> 34:37.078
<i>- Julie Teeger!</i>
-Oh, my god.

34:37.126 --> 34:38.245
<i>No!</i>

34:38.368 --> 34:40.518
<i>- What are you doing now?
- I'm sorry. Sorry.</i>

34:40.539 --> 34:41.995
<i>- Julie Teeger!</i>

34:43.103 --> 34:45.013
Miss teeger.

34:46.987 --> 34:50.114
- <i>Julie teeger!</i>
- Miss Teeger Stop.

34:51.681 --> 34:53.041
<i>That's not good.</i>

34:53.061 --> 34:54.567
He's trying to kill me!

34:54.587 --> 34:56.641
<i>Miss teeger,
they're just made of cardboard.</i>

34:56.815 --> 34:58.089
<i>Sorry.sorry.</i>

34:58.243 --> 34:59.487
<i>Please. Please</i>

34:59.507 --> 35:01.788
<i>Julie teeger!</i>

35:03.065 --> 35:04.164
<i>Julie!</i>

35:05.710 --> 35:07.446
<i>Stop car.</i>

35:09.779 --> 35:12.056
<i>What is that? A three point turn?</i>

35:13.684 --> 35:15.093
<i>Julie, no!</i>

35:15.457 --> 35:16.846
<i>Just stop a car.</i>

35:18.784 --> 35:21.263
<i>God! Fine, fine.</i>

35:24.773 --> 35:25.892
<i>Julie!</i>

35:36.056 --> 35:37.156
<i>No!</i>

35:49.582 --> 35:50.834
Say the word.

35:50.943 --> 35:52.070
Captain!

35:52.090 --> 35:53.561
Take the shot.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.376
- He's not the guy.
- He's not the guy?

35:58.396 --> 36:01.691
<i>No, he's just trying to warn her.
Julie, it's ok.</i>

36:03.144 --> 36:05.417
This will protect you. But be careful.

36:05.437 --> 36:07.422
There's a crazed killer on the loose.

36:17.284 --> 36:18.422
Of course.

36:19.147 --> 36:21.944
So if he's not the guy, who's the guy?

36:22.780 --> 36:24.168
I remember this box

36:24.226 --> 36:27.544
was here in your living room
the day your wife was killed.

36:27.972 --> 36:29.737
And I found this piece

36:30.204 --> 36:32.172
in the other Julie's townhouse.

36:34.791 --> 36:35.947
It's a perfect fit.

36:37.308 --> 36:39.160
I don't understand.
What does that prove?

36:39.296 --> 36:42.402
It proves that you killed both women,
Mr. Teeger.

36:42.942 --> 36:44.659
<i>First your wife, then the other Julie.</i>

36:44.882 --> 36:47.197
You were having an extra-marital
a sex affair.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.070
<i>That...don't deny it, </i>

36:49.108 --> 36:51.797
Mr. Teeger. We already talked to her.
<i>Her name's Maria Hamilton.</i>

36:51.817 --> 36:53.542
You've been seeing her for three years.

36:53.562 --> 36:55.421
She said you got in a fight last week.

36:55.486 --> 36:57.068
She wanted to teach you a lesson.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.332
<i>She was a woman scorned.</i>

36:59.408 --> 37:01.269
<i>You left a bunch of things at her place,</i>

37:01.308 --> 37:03.257
<i>she decided to mail them to your wife.</i>

37:03.277 --> 37:05.756
<i>But the mailing label was torn.</i>

37:05.951 --> 37:08.189
The post office couldn't read
the address.

37:08.353 --> 37:11.170
They delivered the package
to Julie Teeger.

37:11.328 --> 37:13.695
<i>Not your wife. The other Julie.</i>

37:13.715 --> 37:17.165
<i>- The wrong julie teeger.
- The post office confirmed it.</i>

37:17.262 --> 37:19.511
<i>The two Julies got their mail mixed
up all the time.</i>

37:21.074 --> 37:22.574
<i>She was a good neighbor.</i>

37:22.900 --> 37:25.582
<i>She brought the box over
to the other ulie.</i>

37:26.021 --> 37:27.749
<i>I mean, the second Julie. I mean</i>

37:27.870 --> 37:29.046
your wife.

37:31.204 --> 37:33.693
<i>Whatever happened,
it must have happened quickly.</i>

37:33.916 --> 37:34.997
<i>It got ugly.</i>

37:36.028 --> 37:37.359
<i>You Grabbed a knife,</i>

37:37.636 --> 37:40.640
<i>and you killed her right over
there in the hall.</i>

37:41.174 --> 37:43.792
<i>You wanted to make it look
like a Burglary.</i>

37:44.241 --> 37:47.721
<i>You wanted to say you weren't even home.</i>
There was just one problem.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.359
You were afraid that Julie Teeger,

37:50.379 --> 37:53.599
not your wife,
the other, you know who I mean.

37:54.614 --> 37:56.987
<i>You were afraid mue saw too ch.</i>

37:57.375 --> 38:00.076
<i>You ran her down before she got home.</i>

38:01.252 --> 38:05.135
The trailer hitch on your SUV matches
the wound on Julie Teeger's back.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.979
Julie number two, not your Julie.

38:09.888 --> 38:10.756
Yes.

38:11.254 --> 38:12.527
I know which one you mean.

38:13.853 --> 38:16.821
I promised that I would catch your
wife's killer. Remember?

38:17.109 --> 38:18.390
Turn around, Georgie.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.013
We'd have been here sooner,
but you got Lucky.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.794
There was another Julie Teeger
whose son has a few problems.

38:25.814 --> 38:28.214
Took us a while to realize
we had the wrong guy.

38:29.569 --> 38:30.496
What?

38:31.595 --> 38:32.444
No!

38:33.007 --> 38:34.377
How did this happen?

38:36.826 --> 38:38.678
All right, well, I understand.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.173
Thank you for calling.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.041
What?

38:41.148 --> 38:42.340
That was Julie's school.

38:42.398 --> 38:44.327
That let her re-take her driver's test.

38:45.351 --> 38:46.180
Good news?

38:46.490 --> 38:48.496
No,
she passed!

38:50.308 --> 38:52.922
Natalie, how will this impact
my sitting in the front seat?

38:52.942 --> 38:54.228
Congratulations!

38:54.288 --> 38:55.618
Sorry Natalie,

39:07.981 --> 39:09.023
Julie,

39:10.138 --> 39:11.362
Nice wheels, kiddo!

39:11.760 --> 39:13.379
So your mum finally caved in

39:13.827 --> 39:15.312
She always does.

39:15.911 --> 39:18.189
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

39:18.483 --> 39:19.814
My car is still on the shop.

39:21.245 --> 39:22.245
All right.

39:25.729 --> 39:26.912
What's so funny?

39:27.562 --> 39:28.372
No.

39:28.804 --> 39:31.061
Thank you. I would love a ride, Julie.

39:38.618 --> 39:39.655
Thank you.

39:40.084 --> 39:41.575
That's Gina, that's Kimberly.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.514
All right Gina and Kimberly.

39:46.885 --> 39:50.015
Wait wait wait, use your blinker.
Julie !! Blin.. blinker.

39:50.114 --> 39:53.105
Yeah Captain.
It's all under control.

39:53.673 --> 39:57.608
Hey Julie, you can go a little faster.
Come on, drive like your mum.

39:57.838 --> 39:59.073
Just kidding.
