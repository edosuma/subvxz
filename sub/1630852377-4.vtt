WEBVTT

00:02.037 --> 00:03.439
(soft whimsical music)
(dice clattering)

00:03.507 --> 00:05.544
- [Narrator] Americans buy
hundreds of millions of them

00:05.577 --> 00:07.615
every year,

00:07.714 --> 00:10.620
generating over 4 billion
dollars in revenue.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.193
- You can't
underestimate the impact

00:14.326 --> 00:16.531
of the American board
game on society.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.709
- [Narrator] But 150 years ago,
they're almost unheard of.

00:21.775 --> 00:23.879
- George, I don't have money
to gamble on card games.

00:24.078 --> 00:25.916
- This isn't cards.

00:26.082 --> 00:27.686
- [Narrator] The
Parker Brothers.

00:27.686 --> 00:28.555
- They were visionaries.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.959
They saw something
that no one else saw.

00:31.092 --> 00:32.562
- [Narrator] And Milton Bradley.

00:32.628 --> 00:34.699
- The idea that board
games could be a product

00:34.732 --> 00:38.072
that people would purchase,
that was really revolutionary.

00:40.743 --> 00:42.346
- [Narrator] Their
rivalry will spur

00:42.446 --> 00:45.119
the most iconic games
in American history.

00:45.218 --> 00:47.256
- [Parker] It's a game
about life.

00:47.356 --> 00:50.427
- Mr. Parker, this game
will open people's eyes.

00:52.131 --> 00:54.102
- [Narrator] But the
battle for supremacy-

00:54.202 --> 00:56.708
- I'm afraid it has
no chance of success.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.476
- [Narrator] Is no game.

00:58.610 --> 00:59.546
- You almost have
to ask yourself:

00:59.646 --> 01:02.017
Did he think he could
get away with this?

01:02.250 --> 01:02.952
- What now?

01:03.119 --> 01:04.054
- You make a deal with her.

01:04.187 --> 01:06.359
- All of a sudden,
this new thing

01:06.526 --> 01:08.495
changed board games forever.

01:13.238 --> 01:16.377
(soft dramatic music)

01:28.767 --> 01:31.540
(pensive music)

01:36.515 --> 01:38.753
(water dripping)

01:38.853 --> 01:41.092
- [Narrator] America
is a divided nation

01:41.257 --> 01:42.728
in the fall of 1860.

01:43.795 --> 01:47.202
- The country is
consumed with slavery.

01:48.404 --> 01:51.612
And as America expands
west, the question is:

01:51.678 --> 01:54.215
Will the western territories
be slave or free?

01:56.386 --> 01:57.923
- [Narrator] And
in Massachusetts,

01:57.923 --> 02:00.629
a 24-year-old
struggling printmaker

02:00.695 --> 02:04.367
hopes to capitalize on the
crucial presidential election.

02:05.302 --> 02:07.374
It's a young Milton Bradley.

02:07.574 --> 02:08.944
- Milton Bradley grew up

02:08.944 --> 02:12.984
in a very religious,
pious household.

02:13.217 --> 02:18.061
His father was a poor textile
worker who became destitute

02:18.161 --> 02:20.431
when he made a very
bad investment.

02:20.565 --> 02:23.605
He was introverted,
filled with ideas,

02:23.671 --> 02:27.512
but he had a warm personality
and made many friends.

02:29.281 --> 02:30.884
- [Narrator] Bradley's
betting everything

02:30.884 --> 02:32.454
on printing costly lithographs

02:32.588 --> 02:34.926
of an unlikely
presidential candidate:

02:35.193 --> 02:38.899
a country lawyer and one-term
congressman from Illinois.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.607
- A lithograph of
Lincoln on your wall

02:42.707 --> 02:44.477
woulda been a statement
of where you stood

02:44.644 --> 02:46.548
on the issue of slavery

02:46.614 --> 02:49.787
and woulda been a very popular
thing to have at that time.

02:49.854 --> 02:52.794
- [Narrator] But an 11-year-old
from Upstate New York

02:52.826 --> 02:56.633
writes Lincoln a letter that
changes everything for Bradley.

02:57.902 --> 03:01.777
- It's a little girl who
suggests that he grow a beard

03:01.777 --> 03:03.547
to sorta look more stately.

03:05.482 --> 03:08.255
- And the moment he began
to appear in newspapers

03:08.321 --> 03:12.430
wearing his new beard,
sales of the poster dried up

03:12.531 --> 03:15.636
and Bradley had this
big unsold inventory.

03:17.773 --> 03:20.914
- All the lithographs that
Milton Bradley made of Lincoln

03:20.914 --> 03:21.782
now we're worthless.

03:21.782 --> 03:23.216
In fact, people that bought

03:23.349 --> 03:25.622
Abraham Lincoln
lithographs from him

03:25.755 --> 03:27.893
ended up asking for
their money back.

03:27.893 --> 03:30.832
(flames crackling)

03:33.335 --> 03:36.042
- [Narrator] The Milton Bradley
name will become synonymous

03:36.042 --> 03:39.248
with the most iconic
games of all time,

03:39.380 --> 03:43.021
creating a business
worth $350 million

03:43.856 --> 03:46.160
and changing the
way America plays.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.332
(dramatic music)

03:49.398 --> 03:52.371
But right now, with a
young wife to support,

03:52.539 --> 03:55.411
Bradley is on the brink of ruin.

03:55.477 --> 03:58.517
- His close childhood
friend, named George Tapley,

03:58.650 --> 04:00.788
happened to be in Springfield,

04:00.921 --> 04:04.027
struggling to make
it as a bookbinder,

04:04.027 --> 04:05.865
and gets together
with Milton Bradley

04:05.964 --> 04:08.503
and says in so many
words, "Life sucks.

04:08.669 --> 04:10.238
"Let's us go play a game."

04:11.441 --> 04:13.378
- George, I don't have the
money to gamble on card games.

04:13.546 --> 04:16.017
- Well, this isn't cards.

04:17.820 --> 04:18.789
- Tapley has with him

04:18.888 --> 04:22.161
one of the very first
American board games,

04:22.295 --> 04:24.299
called the Mansion of Happiness.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.004
There were no
board games per se,

04:27.270 --> 04:30.009
outside of a few of like
the Mansion of Happiness.

04:30.009 --> 04:31.547
And although Bradley's parents

04:31.680 --> 04:33.884
had played games
with him as a child,

04:33.884 --> 04:35.587
chess, checkers, or anagrams,

04:35.720 --> 04:37.958
he had never seen a board game.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.728
- Games in the mid-1800s

04:39.795 --> 04:43.468
were incredibly education
focused and morally focused.

04:43.568 --> 04:45.405
They were a vessel by
which people could teach

04:45.572 --> 04:47.777
about life and death, religion.

04:47.843 --> 04:50.782
They weren't exactly fun
the way we think of now.

04:51.985 --> 04:53.854
- [Narrator] But not every game.

04:53.954 --> 04:56.994
- Other games had kind
of shady reputation.

04:58.496 --> 05:00.267
- Card games were big,

05:00.333 --> 05:03.406
in large part because
people were gambling,

05:03.573 --> 05:05.611
and this set off alarm bells

05:05.710 --> 05:08.115
among certain
puritanical elements.

05:08.282 --> 05:10.086
It was a sin to gamble.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.024
- Playing cards were known
in some religious circles

05:13.024 --> 05:14.961
as the Devil's pasteboard,

05:15.028 --> 05:18.869
cardboard that would lead
you into a life of gambling

05:18.869 --> 05:21.507
and bad moral choices.

05:21.607 --> 05:24.345
And dice were
probably even worse.

05:25.615 --> 05:29.523
- The original Mansion of
Happiness in England had dice.

05:29.655 --> 05:31.358
But when it came to the States,

05:31.458 --> 05:34.131
it turned into something
we call a teetotum,

05:34.331 --> 05:38.939
which was a wooden spindle
that had a hexagonal base to it

05:38.939 --> 05:41.077
with six numbers on it.

05:41.344 --> 05:43.983
- [Narrator] Players go
forward by landing on virtues,

05:44.049 --> 05:48.759
like honesty or sincerity,
while vices like drinking

05:48.892 --> 05:51.230
or breaking the
Sabbath move you back.

05:51.396 --> 05:52.633
- The goal of this game,

05:52.733 --> 05:55.403
you wanna get to the
Mansion of Happiness,

05:55.504 --> 05:58.510
which many people say
truly represented Heaven.

06:00.915 --> 06:02.317
- Four, five, six...

06:02.484 --> 06:04.021
The Mansion of Happiness.

06:04.021 --> 06:04.788
- [George] So?

06:07.894 --> 06:09.297
- I think it's magnificent.

06:09.497 --> 06:11.101
(light electronic music)

06:11.101 --> 06:14.541
- Here was a game
printed on a label

06:14.640 --> 06:16.678
attached to a
piece of cardboard,

06:16.778 --> 06:18.649
and he's in the
printing business.

06:18.748 --> 06:22.155
So, very quickly, the
idea dawns on him,

06:22.155 --> 06:24.158
"How about if I invent a game?"

06:24.358 --> 06:26.930
(pensive music)

06:29.903 --> 06:31.806
- [Narrator] And after
weeks of tinkering,

06:31.906 --> 06:36.114
he's cracked a new
game that mirrors life.

06:36.114 --> 06:38.920
Players start on
the infancy square

06:38.987 --> 06:42.761
and navigate the board until
they reach happy old age.

06:42.927 --> 06:44.798
But it's not all fun and games.

06:44.898 --> 06:46.535
- The original version
of The Game of Life

06:46.701 --> 06:48.305
actually is pretty dark.

06:48.404 --> 06:50.675
Among other things, it
has a suicide square.

06:51.977 --> 06:56.621
- The square on the board
is a man hanging by a noose.

06:56.687 --> 06:59.091
I mean, it's actually
troubling to look at.

06:59.124 --> 07:02.531
This is a square that once you
land on this, game is over.

07:02.564 --> 07:06.639
Because in real life, if you
commit suicide, game over.

07:09.577 --> 07:12.383
- Because the path of
life had ups and downs

07:12.482 --> 07:14.721
and it mirrored his
own checkered life,

07:14.721 --> 07:18.561
he instinctively called the
game The Checkered Game of Life.

07:20.431 --> 07:22.135
- [Narrator] It's the
first version of a game

07:22.401 --> 07:25.406
that will eventually sell
more than 50 million copies

07:25.608 --> 07:27.010
(reverent music)

07:27.110 --> 07:28.981
and become one of the
most enduring board

07:28.981 --> 07:31.118
games of all time.

07:37.897 --> 07:40.403
But now, Bradley is
manufacturing them

07:40.570 --> 07:42.507
by hand in his print shop.

07:43.642 --> 07:45.813
- There wasn't a lot of
margin in a board game,

07:45.879 --> 07:49.587
so you couldn't afford to
hire an outside printer.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.925
So, the fact that
he had his own press

07:51.958 --> 07:56.332
and could make his own games
himself was quite an advantage.

07:56.465 --> 07:58.336
- To Milton Bradley's delight,

07:58.469 --> 08:00.608
the Checkered Game
of Life was a hit.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.746
His initial run of
400 printed games

08:03.913 --> 08:07.353
sold out in no time flat.

08:07.486 --> 08:08.456
- [Narrator] Just
as Milton Bradley's

08:08.556 --> 08:12.362
new board game business
starts to take off,

08:12.495 --> 08:15.903
Lincoln wins the
election of 1860.

08:16.003 --> 08:18.107
- The America at 1860 is
a very tense place

08:18.174 --> 08:21.279
because, obviously, the
country is about to embark upon

08:21.279 --> 08:23.383
the worst tragedy
of American history,

08:23.483 --> 08:24.853
the worst trauma of
American history,

08:24.987 --> 08:27.324
which is of course
the Civil War.

08:27.458 --> 08:31.766
(muskets firing)
(cannons booming)

08:31.799 --> 08:35.039
- The Civil War has a disruptive
impact on small businesses.

08:35.172 --> 08:36.976
So, for people like
Milton Bradley,

08:37.043 --> 08:40.048
at least in the beginning, it
begins as a moment of ruin.

08:40.081 --> 08:43.756
- Sales of The Game of Life
have dropped off significantly

08:43.922 --> 08:45.927
and it looks like Milton Bradley

08:46.060 --> 08:48.731
will once again
fall on hard times.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.476
- [Narrator] Bradley
considers making weapons

08:54.510 --> 08:58.817
for the Union Army to
make ends meet, until...

09:02.090 --> 09:03.660
He has a better idea.

09:04.928 --> 09:09.738
- A company of Massachusetts
infantrymen are in Springfield.

09:10.673 --> 09:11.943
And when Bradley walks past,

09:12.076 --> 09:14.213
he noticed that although
they're off-duty,

09:14.213 --> 09:15.214
they have nothing to do.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.024
- [Narrator] Bradley
sees a captive audience

09:20.091 --> 09:24.098
for board games if he can make
an important modification.

09:27.104 --> 09:31.077
He creates the world's
first travel-sized games.

09:32.246 --> 09:34.084
- You could play
chess or checkers

09:34.217 --> 09:36.321
with little cardboard
playing pieces.

09:36.555 --> 09:39.662
Of course, there's The Checkered
Game of Life in there too.

09:39.862 --> 09:40.929
There's Domino's.

09:43.200 --> 09:49.211
- It's reported that Bradley
sold 270,000 of these

09:49.746 --> 09:51.183
within the first year.

09:51.249 --> 09:54.656
This, probably more so
than The Game of Life,

09:54.823 --> 09:56.593
established his business.

09:57.829 --> 10:00.867
- Suddenly, everybody knows
who Milton Bradley is.

10:04.007 --> 10:07.179
- [Narrator] At the war's
end just four years later,

10:07.179 --> 10:08.983
Bradley is well on his way

10:09.116 --> 10:11.655
to bringing board
games to the masses.

10:18.266 --> 10:20.037
But just 100 miles away,

10:20.104 --> 10:23.276
another New Englander is
about to change everything.

10:25.279 --> 10:30.356
He's just 16 years old, and
his name is George Parker.

10:31.125 --> 10:34.029
(rising dramatic music)

10:37.904 --> 10:40.811
By 1883, nearly 20 years
since the Civil War,

10:40.910 --> 10:43.313
board games are
becoming more popular,

10:43.313 --> 10:45.117
as new household conveniences

10:45.151 --> 10:49.092
and the eight-hour workday
give Americans leisure time.

10:49.192 --> 10:51.163
- Instead of spending
all of their hours

10:51.196 --> 10:54.702
maintaining the household, they
could relax for a few hours.

10:54.769 --> 10:57.909
And since prices were coming
down, they could buy more.

10:58.042 --> 11:01.949
From the mid-1870s until 1890

11:02.049 --> 11:04.154
was called the gilded
age because of that.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.960
- [Narrator] But most
board games have an agenda.

11:07.026 --> 11:09.832
- There is this effort on
the part of many reformers

11:09.898 --> 11:12.904
in areas such as temperance
to deal with what they think

11:13.037 --> 11:15.075
is the moral decline
of the nation.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.646
So, you have games that
seek to address this

11:17.780 --> 11:19.850
by trying to inject moral truths

11:19.950 --> 11:22.087
back into American
life through gaming.

11:23.757 --> 11:26.329
(pensive music)

11:28.900 --> 11:30.069
- [Narrator] And
in Massachusetts,

11:30.135 --> 11:34.846
16-year-old George Parker
wants to lighten things up.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.750
- Care to make things a
little more interesting?

11:40.388 --> 11:43.094
- George Parker was
much more interested

11:43.194 --> 11:47.001
in fun and play
and amusing people

11:47.067 --> 11:50.542
rather than educating
them for moral benefits.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.612
- Parker had two older brothers,

11:52.712 --> 11:55.851
and he was the different
one among the three.

11:55.951 --> 11:59.291
He was perpetually
filled with ideas.

12:00.694 --> 12:04.033
- Their father had been
a successful sea captain

12:04.133 --> 12:07.106
and then a merchant,
but died at a young age.

12:07.239 --> 12:10.514
And the family income
stopped suddenly,

12:10.746 --> 12:14.720
confronting the Parker Brothers
with needing to do something

12:14.820 --> 12:16.825
and to make a success
of their lives

12:16.958 --> 12:19.997
and to make money
to make ends meet.

12:21.266 --> 12:23.738
- [Narrator] Money is
central to Parker's thinking

12:23.837 --> 12:27.178
and influences his
first big idea.

12:27.277 --> 12:30.016
- It used to be
capitalism was at odds

12:30.116 --> 12:32.988
with what it meant to be
a good white Christian.

12:33.121 --> 12:35.425
That changes, and
now capitalism can be

12:35.425 --> 12:37.464
just an expression
of God's bounty.

12:37.697 --> 12:42.740
- Back in 1840, there were 60
millionaires in all of the US.

12:43.742 --> 12:47.883
By 1880, there's
1,000 millionaires,

12:47.983 --> 12:50.020
and people are
beginning to fantasize

12:50.120 --> 12:52.391
what it might be like to
have that kinda wealth.

12:53.994 --> 12:57.301
- [Narrator] The game he
creates is called Banking.

12:57.301 --> 13:00.072
(pensive music)

13:12.295 --> 13:15.134
But when it's rejected
by two Boston publishers,

13:19.175 --> 13:22.816
he spends his life savings
to print 500 copies.

13:23.884 --> 13:27.658
- He received permission
from his teacher

13:27.791 --> 13:31.332
to take off the
month of December

13:31.398 --> 13:35.305
and peddle his game by rail
all around New England.

13:37.175 --> 13:39.982
- [Narrator] Parker sells
nearly all of his sets,

13:40.048 --> 13:44.990
ending with a profit of $80,
equal to about $2,000 today.

13:45.057 --> 13:48.899
- Not a fortune, but enough to
give him a taste of success,

13:49.065 --> 13:51.470
and George wants to keep going.

13:51.470 --> 13:52.872
He wants to create games

13:52.972 --> 13:56.312
that aren't all about
virtues and vices,

13:56.445 --> 13:59.384
but kinda show what's
going on in life.

14:00.920 --> 14:05.329
- This is an era of robber
barons and industrial magnates

14:05.329 --> 14:07.934
and high-finance experts,

14:08.068 --> 14:10.573
people like Andrew
Carnegie in steel,

14:10.573 --> 14:13.211
Cornelius Vanderbilt
in railroads.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.117
People admired these
wealthy individuals

14:16.216 --> 14:18.053
and the success
that they had had.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.759
They wanted to be like that guy.

14:20.992 --> 14:25.902
This is what Parker was tapping
into, that vicarious thrill

14:26.002 --> 14:28.272
that I may not be
running a big company,

14:28.338 --> 14:30.944
but I can make money
around the kitchen table

14:31.044 --> 14:33.281
as we play one of
Parker Brothers' games.

14:34.484 --> 14:36.254
- I think you're
really onto something.

14:37.957 --> 14:39.694
- His company began to grow

14:39.794 --> 14:42.767
and he discovered
something, a real problem.

14:42.967 --> 14:44.036
He didn't like business.

14:44.102 --> 14:47.375
He liked inventing and he
was a terrific salesman.

14:47.408 --> 14:51.850
To supplement his weakness, he
convinced his middle brother,

14:51.950 --> 14:55.223
Charles, to quit his
job and come join him.

14:55.256 --> 14:58.997
- [Narrator] And in 1888, a
new gaming company is born.

15:01.502 --> 15:02.571
Parker Brothers.

15:04.808 --> 15:07.848
(pensive music)

15:07.980 --> 15:11.187
Meanwhile, Milton
Bradley is expanding.

15:11.253 --> 15:13.424
- He's got games, he's
getting into puzzles.

15:13.490 --> 15:18.701
He is really cashing in
on fads that are going on.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.373
- [Narrator] In the two
decades since the Civil War,

15:21.439 --> 15:24.546
Milton Bradley has even
become the first in the US

15:24.546 --> 15:26.348
to make croquet sets,

15:26.415 --> 15:29.488
writing rules that have become
the standard to this day.

15:31.324 --> 15:34.998
And now he's pioneering
another idea common today,

15:35.132 --> 15:37.036
aiming games towards children

15:37.136 --> 15:39.874
and combining
education with fun.

15:39.974 --> 15:42.613
- Milton Bradley was
very interested in games

15:42.613 --> 15:43.782
as a way of teaching.

15:43.882 --> 15:46.955
He really saw the
potential that games had,

15:47.121 --> 15:48.324
particularly for children.

15:48.357 --> 15:52.231
- The first board games were
not really marketed for kids.

15:52.297 --> 15:55.070
Today, even though games
could be educational,

15:55.170 --> 15:57.676
there's so many lessons
that can be learned,

15:57.676 --> 15:59.310
and that was not the case then.

16:00.412 --> 16:02.250
- [Narrator] But his
investors aren't happy

16:02.283 --> 16:06.124
about what the shift in focus
could do to their bottom line.

16:06.191 --> 16:07.961
- The investors are saying
we need to market to adults,

16:08.060 --> 16:09.564
not children without any money.

16:11.901 --> 16:13.304
They're plain wrong.

16:13.437 --> 16:15.441
The children are good business.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.380
You capture their imagination
and the adults will follow.

16:18.380 --> 16:19.448
- Stick to your guns.

16:22.221 --> 16:23.456
I'll make up their share.

16:28.065 --> 16:28.934
- [Narrator] It takes time,

16:29.067 --> 16:31.806
but with George Tapley's
financial backing,

16:31.939 --> 16:34.945
it's a risk that
eventually pays off.

16:35.044 --> 16:37.884
By the 1890s, he's
the leading game maker

16:38.084 --> 16:40.990
in the United States.

16:41.123 --> 16:43.026
But he's about to
meet his match.

16:43.226 --> 16:45.832
(birds chirping)

16:46.032 --> 16:47.937
(tense music)

16:48.069 --> 16:50.642
Budding rival George
Parker is grown up

16:50.942 --> 16:54.047
and determined to take
over the game industry.

16:54.114 --> 16:58.489
- One of George Parker's
problems as a entrepreneur

16:58.590 --> 17:01.562
is the fact that he
was still very young

17:01.562 --> 17:03.566
and he looked even younger.

17:03.566 --> 17:06.104
So, it was suggested to him

17:06.237 --> 17:09.076
that he grow a beard
and a mustache.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.280
It certainly made
him look older,

17:11.379 --> 17:15.254
and he learned the merit
of dressing very well

17:15.321 --> 17:18.027
in very fine suits,
so the transformation

17:18.227 --> 17:19.361
was then complete.

17:20.531 --> 17:23.136
- [Narrator] Parker also
pushes his games to evolve.

17:23.236 --> 17:25.675
New titles like
Crossing the Ocean

17:25.675 --> 17:28.078
are role-playing adventures.

17:28.245 --> 17:30.684
- The thing about the ocean game

17:30.684 --> 17:32.888
is people couldn't do that yet.

17:32.988 --> 17:37.196
Except the uber-wealthy,
who is taking ships?!

17:37.262 --> 17:41.003
- The idea that you
actually took on a role

17:41.136 --> 17:43.274
when you played a Parker game

17:43.407 --> 17:47.314
was very exciting
to kids of that era.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.787
Now, of course, we know
that role-playing games

17:49.953 --> 17:52.058
are a huge business today.

17:52.257 --> 17:53.326
The roots of those games

17:53.393 --> 17:57.033
go back to George Parker's
early adventure games.

17:58.168 --> 17:59.605
- [Narrator] But to
top Milton Bradley,

17:59.705 --> 18:03.045
Parker aggressively
pursues better ideas.

18:03.145 --> 18:06.050
- He realized that the
American toy industry

18:06.150 --> 18:08.889
got its ideas every
year from Europe.

18:08.989 --> 18:11.494
Parker said, "Uh-uh,
I'm gonna get a leg up

18:11.494 --> 18:12.830
"on the competition."

18:13.029 --> 18:14.901
He sailed to England.

18:15.033 --> 18:18.240
And while he was there
during the 1890s,

18:18.340 --> 18:21.514
he discovered
tiddlywinks, ping-pong,

18:21.580 --> 18:25.486
and he beat Bradley in
every one of those areas.

18:28.527 --> 18:32.199
- [Narrator] By 1893, Parker
Brothers' annual sales

18:32.299 --> 18:35.238
hit over $3 million
in today's money.

18:36.307 --> 18:39.313
The success gets the
attention of his rival.

18:40.549 --> 18:42.886
- When Milton Bradley takes
notice of George Parker,

18:43.020 --> 18:44.790
he really thinks
a lot of his games

18:44.790 --> 18:47.028
are showy and kind of gaudy.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.831
The term vulgar comes to mind.

18:49.064 --> 18:52.371
- [Narrator] He knows his
young competitor is closing in.

18:52.470 --> 18:55.978
- Parker was now causing
Bradley to chase him.

18:56.045 --> 18:58.248
I don't think Milton
Bradley really liked that,

18:58.415 --> 18:59.317
because here was this kid

18:59.450 --> 19:01.154
who was now beating
him to the punch.

19:01.354 --> 19:04.126
(intense music)

19:05.429 --> 19:08.200
- [Narrator] But soon,
a new player emerges

19:08.234 --> 19:11.040
with a game that will turn the
fortunes of Parker Brothers

19:11.206 --> 19:13.410
and Milton Bradley upside down.

19:18.621 --> 19:20.257
At the turn of the 20th century,

19:20.323 --> 19:23.831
the most popular games, like
Parker Brothers' Banking,

19:23.831 --> 19:26.301
allow players to
dream of big wealth.

19:27.504 --> 19:29.107
But the reality of the times

19:29.207 --> 19:31.646
is much different
for most Americans.

19:33.749 --> 19:36.722
- In 1900, 7 out
of 10 US workers

19:36.722 --> 19:38.959
made less than 20 cents an hour

19:39.092 --> 19:42.032
and they were working
six days a week.

19:42.132 --> 19:44.503
- There's no such
thing as minimum wage.

19:44.603 --> 19:48.010
There are very few
protections for workers.

19:48.109 --> 19:49.813
- The problem in
America at that time

19:50.113 --> 19:53.052
was this horrible and,
in fact, an egregious gap

19:53.152 --> 19:55.089
between the very wealthy
and the very poor.

19:55.289 --> 19:58.128
(birds chirping)

20:01.267 --> 20:03.305
- [Narrator] And one woman
takes an innovative approach

20:03.471 --> 20:06.077
to reform this wealth gap.

20:06.243 --> 20:08.683
Her name is Elizabeth Magie.

20:08.782 --> 20:12.388
- This woman writes
stories, writes poetry,

20:12.522 --> 20:15.261
she's a comedian,
she's an actress.

20:15.394 --> 20:17.265
- She was an outspoken feminist,

20:17.365 --> 20:20.236
and she was very
politically active as well,

20:20.303 --> 20:23.476
specifically following this
man named Henry George.

20:25.681 --> 20:27.451
A lot of us don't know
about Henry George today,

20:27.550 --> 20:29.888
but he was a hugely
famous political

20:29.888 --> 20:32.126
economist in his times.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.430
- Henry George had the opinion

20:34.564 --> 20:37.336
that land should be
a common resource

20:37.368 --> 20:41.243
and people shouldn't be able
to buy and sell their neighbors

20:41.410 --> 20:44.249
or create economic problems.

20:44.316 --> 20:47.287
And she wanted a game to
prove how terrible it would be

20:47.421 --> 20:49.459
to have a moneygrubbing landlord

20:49.559 --> 20:52.364
who was driving you
into bankruptcy.

20:52.431 --> 20:55.837
- [Narrator] So she creates
one, called The Landlord's Game.

20:57.741 --> 21:02.718
- It was a game that taught
against the evils of monopolies,

21:02.751 --> 21:08.127
how landlords shouldn't be
allowed to increase their rents

21:08.194 --> 21:12.102
and, you know, in essence,
bankrupt tenants.

21:12.268 --> 21:13.336
- It's pretty ingenious

21:13.436 --> 21:15.742
because people are sitting
in the shoes of folks

21:15.842 --> 21:19.048
and seeing how these
theories actually work.

21:19.148 --> 21:20.619
- [Narrator] And the
game is groundbreaking

21:20.619 --> 21:22.187
for another reason.

21:22.353 --> 21:24.759
- For the very first time,

21:24.859 --> 21:27.330
there is no starting
point and ending point.

21:27.463 --> 21:28.566
Now you have a game
that you can go

21:28.733 --> 21:31.337
around and around and around,

21:31.470 --> 21:33.375
so that was completely different

21:33.474 --> 21:35.946
than anything that
anyone's ever seen before.

21:38.752 --> 21:40.722
- Magie self-publishes the game,

21:40.789 --> 21:44.195
finding modest success at
colleges and universities.

21:44.328 --> 21:45.599
But for the Landlord's Game

21:45.732 --> 21:48.170
to have a significant
social impact,

21:48.336 --> 21:50.339
she needs a major distributor

21:51.609 --> 21:55.617
and sets her sights on one
of the biggest in the game.

21:59.791 --> 22:02.630
(dramatic music)

22:14.653 --> 22:17.558
- Miss Magie,
please, have a seat.

22:23.236 --> 22:26.108
- This game will
open people's eyes.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.746
Like working-class
families everywhere,

22:28.813 --> 22:31.619
people will have to make
their meager wages stretch

22:31.619 --> 22:33.822
to cover rent.

22:33.889 --> 22:38.030
And if they can't, they go
to the poor house or jail.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.968
Meanwhile, the
railroads, the banks,

22:39.968 --> 22:41.538
and the government get rich.

22:42.772 --> 22:43.775
- Hmm...

22:43.808 --> 22:44.676
Wonderful.

22:46.547 --> 22:49.686
But I'm afraid it has
no chance of success.

22:50.922 --> 22:53.426
People wanna be empowered
when they play a game,

22:53.526 --> 22:56.298
not oppressed by forces
they can't control.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.339
- It had a lot with morals
and I had a lot with values.

23:00.405 --> 23:03.010
It was the stuff that Parker
actually rebelled against.

23:04.279 --> 23:05.348
- [Narrator] Parker
closes the door

23:05.516 --> 23:07.018
on the Landlord's Game...

23:07.854 --> 23:09.022
For now.

23:09.289 --> 23:13.632
But soon after, there's a
seismic shift in the business.

23:13.698 --> 23:18.006
In 1911, Milton Bradley, the
man credited with launching

23:18.006 --> 23:20.945
the board game industry is dead,

23:21.011 --> 23:23.984
opening a window of
opportunity for George Parker.

23:25.453 --> 23:26.590
He doesn't know it yet,

23:26.656 --> 23:30.296
but his best chance at topping
Milton Bradley's company

23:30.428 --> 23:32.867
may have already
walked out the door.

23:38.711 --> 23:39.581
(slow melodic music)

23:39.713 --> 23:41.250
- The 1920s are a
really fantastic time

23:41.316 --> 23:43.922
for both Milton Bradley
and Parker Brothers,

23:43.922 --> 23:44.891
the game industry overall.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.595
And there's a huge boom
in consumer spending,

23:47.695 --> 23:49.599
so it was much easier
to convince people

23:49.699 --> 23:52.070
to spend their hard-earned
money on games.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.179
(intense music)

23:57.279 --> 23:58.583
- [Narrator] But at
the end of the decade,

23:58.683 --> 24:01.454
the good times come
to a screeching halt.

24:02.591 --> 24:04.828
- The great boom of the 1920s

24:04.861 --> 24:10.539
was followed by the colossal
stock market crash of 1929.

24:11.039 --> 24:14.814
The economic
devastation was severe.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.619
A lot of retailers
fell on hard times.

24:17.752 --> 24:20.424
This immediately had
an adverse effect

24:20.490 --> 24:22.694
on both Parker Brothers
and Milton Bradley.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.468
- [Narrator] By 1932,
the Great Depression

24:26.636 --> 24:28.973
has put 15 million out of work

24:29.007 --> 24:33.248
and Americans across the country
struggle to make ends meet.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.220
- The simple eradication
of thousands of banks

24:36.487 --> 24:40.394
and everybody's deposits and
small businesses and farms.

24:40.494 --> 24:43.300
It's economic suffering
on an unprecedented scale

24:43.500 --> 24:44.503
in American history.

24:45.470 --> 24:47.509
(pensive music)

24:47.642 --> 24:49.545
- One of those
unemployed Americans

24:49.612 --> 24:52.851
is a former heating repairman
named Charles Darrow.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.999
- In 1932, the Darrow
family was struggling

25:00.065 --> 25:03.205
and Charles Darrow did
all kinds of odd jobs

25:03.371 --> 25:04.307
to try to earn money

25:04.406 --> 25:07.946
from patching concrete
and walking dogs.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.388
- [Narrator] As Darrow
scrambles to make ends meet,

25:12.488 --> 25:15.661
he also works on an
idea to pass the time.

25:16.763 --> 25:18.266
It's a board game
that deals with

25:18.399 --> 25:20.003
buying and selling property.

25:21.673 --> 25:24.011
He calls it Monopoly.

25:28.418 --> 25:31.491
- Even though we all know the
Monopoly game to be square,

25:31.558 --> 25:35.766
the first version, Darrow
actually made it in a circle.

25:35.799 --> 25:39.540
The reasoning was simple: His
kitchen table was a circle.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.413
- [Narrator] In
the spring of 1934,

25:43.514 --> 25:46.252
Darrow submits his
homemade Monopoly game

25:46.419 --> 25:48.558
to the Milton Bradley Company,

25:48.691 --> 25:51.162
now run by George
Tapley's son, William.

25:52.430 --> 25:54.300
- Milton Bradley
gets back to him

25:54.400 --> 25:57.106
and they just give a
terse, "No thank you."

26:03.585 --> 26:06.223
- [Narrator] Darrow's
next stop is their rival,

26:06.423 --> 26:07.560
Parker Brothers.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.163
(tense music)

26:13.470 --> 26:16.342
(dice rolling)

26:16.476 --> 26:19.348
- Parker Brothers
gets back to him.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.385
- "Thank you for
submitting the game.

26:21.451 --> 26:23.456
"We don't think it fits
our line right now,"

26:23.623 --> 26:25.159
and then a signature.

26:30.168 --> 26:33.074
- [Narrator] As Christmas
1934 approaches,

26:33.074 --> 26:35.813
Darrow makes a desperate move.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.618
- After Milton Bradley and
Parker Brothers rejected Darrow

26:38.751 --> 26:39.954
and he knew he was on his own,

26:40.020 --> 26:43.795
he took the incredible risk of
printing copies of the game,

26:43.861 --> 26:46.900
which during the Depression
was an amazing risk.

26:48.503 --> 26:50.407
- [Narrator] He then
convinces Wanamaker's,

26:50.641 --> 26:54.214
the prestigious Philadelphia
department store, to sell them.

26:54.214 --> 26:55.884
- Department stores
like Wanamaker's

26:55.984 --> 26:58.656
weren't just stores,
they were experiences.

26:58.756 --> 27:00.827
So, to be able to
sell anything there,

27:00.893 --> 27:04.633
particularly a game, that
was a huge deal for Monopoly.

27:05.769 --> 27:07.573
- [Narrator] Next, he
travels to New York City

27:07.673 --> 27:10.779
and the mecca of toy
stores, FAO Schwarz,

27:10.912 --> 27:13.049
who also agree to sell the game.

27:13.917 --> 27:15.888
And then he waits.

27:18.459 --> 27:21.533
- The most nerve-wracking part
for those in the toy industry

27:21.632 --> 27:24.004
is putting stuff on the
market at Christmas.

27:24.070 --> 27:27.143
What was even worse is it
was during the Depression.

27:27.143 --> 27:29.948
(pensive music)

27:31.050 --> 27:32.152
- [Narrator] But in both stores,

27:32.218 --> 27:36.427
Monopoly strikes a chord with
the public and sells out.

27:36.528 --> 27:38.832
- It was just a fantasy
that so many people

27:38.965 --> 27:41.336
who were hit so hard
economically

27:41.537 --> 27:42.840
just couldn't resist.

27:42.939 --> 27:45.077
It was the perfect game
at the perfect time.

27:46.947 --> 27:49.819
- [Narrator] And word of
mouth spreads quickly.

27:49.919 --> 27:53.660
- A friend of Sally
Parker-Barton,

27:53.793 --> 27:55.698
the daughter of George Parker,

27:55.797 --> 27:58.368
receives a phone call
from an old schoolmate

27:58.535 --> 28:00.539
who's now living
in Philadelphia.

28:00.639 --> 28:02.877
And this school mates
simply says to her,

28:02.977 --> 28:05.015
"I just want you to know
that there is a game

28:05.081 --> 28:07.886
"that's selling really well
down here called Monopoly."

28:07.953 --> 28:10.592
- Remember, Darrow first
went to Parker Brothers

28:10.692 --> 28:12.763
to try and sell the
game, and they reject it.

28:12.863 --> 28:15.702
And Parker Brothers
in the early-1930s

28:15.834 --> 28:18.106
is a firm in trouble,
like many others.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.711
They need a hit and
they need it fast.

28:20.811 --> 28:22.948
- [Narrator] Now, George
Parker is desperate

28:23.082 --> 28:25.621
to fix his company's mistake.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.023
- What in God's name
were you thinking?

28:27.089 --> 28:29.961
Now, get him in here
before someone else does.

28:31.698 --> 28:33.101
- Darrow is already
on the market

28:33.200 --> 28:36.140
and he was actually
ramping up production

28:36.140 --> 28:37.576
when the phone call came in.

28:49.031 --> 28:52.871
- Darrow agrees to sell the
rights to Monopoly for $7,000,

28:52.971 --> 28:56.913
which is about $135,000
in today's money.

28:56.979 --> 28:59.619
It's not the kinda money
that'll make you rich,

28:59.752 --> 29:02.189
but Parker agrees to pay Darrow

29:02.288 --> 29:05.863
a certain percentage
on every game sold.

29:05.963 --> 29:08.668
This is gonna make
Darrow a very rich man.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.576
- [Narrator] But before
unleashing Monopoly

29:12.742 --> 29:14.479
on the rest of the country,

29:14.613 --> 29:17.586
George Parker puts
his own stamp on it.

29:17.752 --> 29:18.787
- Darrow, believe it or not,

29:18.887 --> 29:21.826
didn't supply any game
tokens with his game.

29:21.893 --> 29:25.667
He simply stated in his rules,
"Use small household objects

29:25.801 --> 29:27.937
"to represent your
playing pieces."

29:28.037 --> 29:31.545
- [Narrator] Parker adds
the iconic game pieces.

29:31.711 --> 29:34.618
- The other key to success

29:34.751 --> 29:37.355
was the rewriting of the rules.

29:37.355 --> 29:38.891
Darrow's rules were sketchy.

29:39.025 --> 29:42.165
George Parker had
one enduring skill.

29:42.298 --> 29:45.505
It was writing
immaculately clear rules,

29:45.637 --> 29:48.242
and he revised the
rules for Monopoly.

29:49.679 --> 29:52.083
- [Narrator] Monopoly
instantly becomes a phenomenon

29:52.150 --> 29:56.291
unlike anything ever seen
in the board game business.

29:56.357 --> 30:01.400
- In 1936, Parker Brothers
sold 1.8 million Monopoly.

30:02.904 --> 30:05.241
And the printing presses
of that era were not fast,

30:05.341 --> 30:09.650
so 1.8 million was
all they could supply.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.755
Sales could well have
been more than that.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.156
(flashbulb snapping)

30:13.189 --> 30:14.560
- [Photographer] Come on, now
let's have one shaking hands.

30:14.659 --> 30:16.763
- [Narrator] The press
picks up on the story

30:16.830 --> 30:20.237
and Darrow is thrust into
the national spotlight.

30:20.336 --> 30:23.943
- Being unemployed and
badly needing anything

30:24.076 --> 30:26.047
to take my mind off my troubles,

30:26.214 --> 30:29.689
I made by hand a very crude game

30:29.821 --> 30:31.824
for the sole purpose
of amusing myself.

30:33.194 --> 30:34.262
But I suppose...

30:36.233 --> 30:38.572
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

30:38.772 --> 30:40.676
(crowd laughing)

30:40.808 --> 30:42.211
- [Narrator] For a
nation in the grips

30:42.211 --> 30:43.848
of the Great Depression,

30:43.914 --> 30:47.956
Darrow's creation story of
Monopoly makes great copy.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.760
There's just one problem:

30:51.863 --> 30:53.801
Almost none of it is true.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.871
(suspenseful music)

31:00.245 --> 31:03.586
In 1936, Monopoly
becomes a smash hit

31:03.719 --> 31:05.957
for Charles Darrow
and Parker Brothers.

31:06.122 --> 31:07.760
It's on its way to becoming

31:07.826 --> 31:12.435
one of the greatest selling
board games of all time.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.105
But Darrow's success story

31:14.238 --> 31:16.843
is not exactly what
it appears to be.

31:18.379 --> 31:22.320
Monopoly is clearly taken
from a 30-year-old board game

31:22.320 --> 31:23.989
Parker Brothers rejected:

31:25.125 --> 31:27.462
Elizabeth Magie's
The Landlord's Game.

31:30.770 --> 31:33.508
- The Landlord's Game was
really popular in colleges

31:33.508 --> 31:35.512
and it actually
grew in popularity

31:35.745 --> 31:38.851
when the college students
would go home for the summer.

31:39.018 --> 31:40.488
- They were localized boards.

31:40.488 --> 31:41.791
So, if you were
playing in Boston,

31:41.891 --> 31:43.426
you would put Boston
properties on.

31:43.426 --> 31:44.596
If you were playing in Chicago,

31:44.729 --> 31:46.031
you'd throw the Loop on there.

31:46.131 --> 31:48.269
In New York City, you
would have Broadway.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.345
- [Narrator] In 1932,
Charles Darrow was introduced

31:53.411 --> 31:56.318
to one of the localized
versions of The Landlord's Game

31:56.417 --> 31:59.390
at a dinner party he
attended with his wife.

31:59.457 --> 32:03.097
- It so happened that friends
suggest that they play

32:03.163 --> 32:07.907
a new handmade game that had
come up from Atlantic City.

32:08.007 --> 32:10.845
- The Quakers in Atlantic
city were the ones

32:10.945 --> 32:13.050
that gave it the theme
that we know today,

32:13.182 --> 32:15.121
which is Boardwalk
and Park Place.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.424
All the street are
Atlantic City names.

32:21.298 --> 32:23.168
- [Narrator] Significant
modifications are made

32:23.302 --> 32:25.306
to the look of The
Landlord's Game,

32:26.909 --> 32:29.179
creating the now-iconic board,

32:29.313 --> 32:31.885
but the rules are
strikingly similar.

32:31.918 --> 32:35.959
- There was four railroads
and the same amount of spaces,

32:36.059 --> 32:40.000
same amount of utilities,
and a go-to-jail card.

32:43.941 --> 32:45.678
- [Narrator] When Darrow
sells Parker Brothers

32:45.944 --> 32:49.785
the rights to Monopoly, they
don't patent it right away.

32:51.021 --> 32:53.860
- It's the patent
examiner's responsibility

32:53.959 --> 32:56.932
to search all prior
patents of that class

32:57.065 --> 32:59.538
and see if anything
similar turns up

32:59.538 --> 33:00.973
which might disallow it.

33:07.953 --> 33:11.126
- [Narrator] It's not until
after Monopoly hits the market

33:11.259 --> 33:13.196
that Parker Brothers and Darrow

33:13.329 --> 33:15.834
finally apply for
a design patent.

33:17.203 --> 33:20.377
- And when Parker Brothers
went to the patent office,

33:20.476 --> 33:22.847
they found they had
their uh-oh moment.

33:24.050 --> 33:27.056
- Elizabeth Magie had
patented her original version

33:27.222 --> 33:31.096
back in 1904 and again in 1924.

33:33.835 --> 33:35.104
- So...

33:35.104 --> 33:35.906
What now?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.878
- You make a deal with her.

33:39.078 --> 33:41.850
(pensive music)

33:46.860 --> 33:51.869
(crickets chirping)
(uneasy music)

33:52.336 --> 33:54.441
- [Narrator] George Parker
goes to convince Magie

33:54.441 --> 33:55.409
to sell the patent.

33:58.849 --> 34:01.187
With the game just
gaining popularity,

34:01.253 --> 34:04.994
neither knows that untold
millions are at stake.

34:06.362 --> 34:08.601
- It's not the
money, Mr. Parker.

34:08.868 --> 34:12.441
I'll sell you the rights to
my game on one condition.

34:14.111 --> 34:18.219
Besides Monopoly, you
manufacture my original game,

34:18.318 --> 34:21.491
The Landlord Game,
just as I created it.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.432
- You have a deal.

34:32.879 --> 34:34.650
- Parker Brothers strikes
up a deal with Darrow

34:34.917 --> 34:38.190
that allows for him to receive
a pretty large lump sum,

34:38.290 --> 34:41.631
as well as residuals that
continue to this day.

34:41.896 --> 34:44.769
With Lizzie Magie, the best
we can tell they paid her $500

34:44.902 --> 34:47.474
and no residuals,
and that was that.

34:47.575 --> 34:49.478
- [Narrator] Meanwhile,
Parker Brothers produces

34:49.545 --> 34:54.019
10,000 copies of the
landlord's game, as promised,

34:54.153 --> 34:56.324
but the game and
its anticapitalist

34:56.324 --> 34:58.361
message is a bust.

34:58.461 --> 35:02.102
- If you say, "Wow, this
is a game about economics

35:02.201 --> 35:05.876
"and we're gonna teach
you about single taxes,"

35:06.009 --> 35:08.815
who is gonna run
and buy that game?

35:09.014 --> 35:09.916
(laughing) Who?

35:10.885 --> 35:13.356
Show of hands, who?
(flames crackling)

35:13.423 --> 35:16.797
- And in the end, they took
back almost 10,000 copies

35:16.930 --> 35:18.365
and all of 'em were burned up.

35:24.310 --> 35:27.315
(gentle music)

35:27.348 --> 35:30.155
- [Narrator] Monopoly's
success allows Parker Brothers

35:30.221 --> 35:34.463
to leave Milton Bradley in
the dust for the next decade.

35:34.530 --> 35:37.669
- Bradley had a competing
product called Easy Money,

35:37.936 --> 35:40.942
but its sales never really
approached that of Monopoly.

35:41.075 --> 35:42.812
Milton Bradley was
in rocky shape.

35:43.079 --> 35:46.953
They had a lot of investors
who were anxious for profits,

35:47.086 --> 35:48.557
and now here comes
Parker Brothers

35:48.557 --> 35:50.392
with the biggest game ever.

35:52.598 --> 35:54.333
- [Narrator] As Milton
Bradley struggles,

35:54.399 --> 35:57.540
a school teacher from San
Diego named Eleanor Abbott

35:57.640 --> 36:00.713
is inspired to create a
game during a dark moment

36:00.713 --> 36:03.116
that will change
both their fortunes.

36:04.352 --> 36:06.524
- [Philip] She was
recovering from polio

36:06.524 --> 36:09.262
in a San Diego hospital

36:09.328 --> 36:11.701
and she took pity on
all the poor children

36:11.933 --> 36:15.106
who were there with her and
decided she would cheer them up

36:15.239 --> 36:17.410
by inventing a simple
children's game.

36:18.647 --> 36:21.885
- A game that didn't
require any reading skills,

36:21.985 --> 36:23.923
you didn't have to
know your numbers.

36:23.989 --> 36:27.229
All you had to know were
colors to have a success.

36:27.396 --> 36:29.366
- [Narrator] Launched in 1949,

36:29.400 --> 36:33.073
Candy Land becomes one of
the biggest hits of all time,

36:33.140 --> 36:37.182
eventually going on to
sell 40 million copies.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.887
- Candy Land actually
becomes the cornerstone

36:40.019 --> 36:42.324
of a larger line of
games for children

36:42.390 --> 36:45.297
and it hearkens back to Milton
Bradley's original roots

36:45.363 --> 36:48.034
of making things for
children and making them fun.

36:49.571 --> 36:52.243
- [Narrator] But for Milton
Bradley to reclaim number one

36:52.309 --> 36:56.051
from Parker Brothers, they
need another smash hit,

36:56.150 --> 36:59.858
and they just may have
it in a 100-year-old idea

37:00.024 --> 37:01.829
from Milton Bradley himself.

37:01.995 --> 37:05.501
(rising suspenseful music)

37:10.511 --> 37:11.513
(plsying piece tapping)

37:11.513 --> 37:12.716
In the late-1940s,

37:12.749 --> 37:15.219
Parker Brothers is riding a
wave of unprecedented success.

37:15.286 --> 37:17.858
- Parker Brothers is just
hitting it outta the park.

37:18.091 --> 37:18.994
Clue.

37:19.227 --> 37:19.862
Risk.

37:20.095 --> 37:21.098
Sorry.

37:21.298 --> 37:22.300
Who can not love Clue?

37:22.433 --> 37:24.270
It's actually in our lexicon.

37:24.336 --> 37:26.341
If you sit there at a
dinner party and you say,

37:26.440 --> 37:28.846
"It was a Colonel
Mustard in the library

37:29.012 --> 37:30.015
"with the candlestick,"

37:30.081 --> 37:32.719
people know exactly who
you're talking about.

37:34.723 --> 37:35.959
- [Narrator] But
of all the games

37:36.092 --> 37:38.063
Parker Brothers brings to life,

37:38.163 --> 37:41.469
Monopoly continues to
be the crown jewel.

37:41.570 --> 37:46.513
By the 1950s, sales
reached $13.5 million,

37:46.613 --> 37:49.619
the equivalent of
$150 million today.

37:51.420 --> 37:54.695
- Monopoly sets become as
ubiquitous in American homes

37:54.695 --> 37:56.130
as refrigerators and cars.

37:56.297 --> 37:58.101
So, I think that Monopoly

37:58.167 --> 38:00.238
ends up becoming this
really interesting artifact

38:00.404 --> 38:02.142
that people really cling to

38:02.275 --> 38:05.014
as a sign of
tradition and America.

38:05.214 --> 38:07.786
(pensive music)

38:11.091 --> 38:13.163
- [Narrator] But Parker
Brothers' oldest rival

38:13.362 --> 38:15.234
isn't surrendering.

38:15.366 --> 38:18.506
In 1959, Milton Bradley
puts their hopes

38:18.606 --> 38:21.945
into an old relic from
their founders past.

38:22.079 --> 38:23.148
- What they did
is they went back

38:23.248 --> 38:24.417
to the Checkered Board of Life,

38:24.483 --> 38:27.890
the game that was over a
hundred years old at this time,

38:27.890 --> 38:30.161
and this was really
a risky idea.

38:30.328 --> 38:33.668
(light whimsical music)

38:34.670 --> 38:37.441
- In 1960, the new Game of Life

38:37.542 --> 38:40.281
debuts at the New
York City Toy Fair,

38:40.413 --> 38:42.752
refreshed for a post-war world.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.592
- I made $50,000 in
the stock market today.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.360
- That's life!

38:49.464 --> 38:51.368
- The Checkered Game of Life

38:51.468 --> 38:53.672
used this new thing
called lithography,

38:53.705 --> 38:58.014
while the Game of Life in 1960
added plastic to the game.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.316
And this was a breakthrough

38:59.383 --> 39:02.756
because prior to the perfection
of injection molding,

39:02.756 --> 39:04.560
board games were entirely flat.

39:04.626 --> 39:09.402
And the Game of Life from
1960 was labeled a 3-D game.

39:09.536 --> 39:11.507
- The game itself is
filled with things

39:11.606 --> 39:16.082
like not so much the
virtues and the vices

39:16.181 --> 39:18.553
as much as it's
making career choices

39:18.620 --> 39:20.723
and whether you're going to
college or getting a job.

39:20.823 --> 39:23.529
It's not about reaching
a happy old age anymore.

39:23.696 --> 39:25.700
It's about being a millionaire.

39:25.766 --> 39:30.007
- Games and toys are often
a depiction of the society

39:30.140 --> 39:32.345
and economic
conditions at the time,

39:32.411 --> 39:35.250
and I think that that's the
case with the Game of Life.

39:36.721 --> 39:40.126
- [Narrator] The update is a
wild success with the public,

39:40.259 --> 39:42.999
going on to sell
50 million copies.

39:43.165 --> 39:45.705
The Game of Life as revised

39:45.738 --> 39:49.310
became the biggest selling
board game in Bradley's history,

39:49.377 --> 39:52.685
far eclipsing the original
Checkered Game of Life.

39:52.784 --> 39:54.755
- [Narrator] Competition
between Milton Bradley

39:54.821 --> 39:58.828
and Parker Brothers continues
for another two decades,

39:58.828 --> 40:00.899
but ultimately ends at the hands

40:00.899 --> 40:02.903
of another giant corporation.

40:04.439 --> 40:08.180
In 1984, toy giant Hasbro
buys out Milton Bradley

40:08.346 --> 40:10.316
for about $350 million

40:12.220 --> 40:15.761
and then in 1991 acquires Tonka,

40:15.761 --> 40:17.296
which owns Parker Brothers,

40:17.430 --> 40:19.635
for over a half a
billion dollars.

40:20.904 --> 40:25.713
As for Monopoly, today its sales
approach 300 million copies

40:26.480 --> 40:27.550
and it continues to be

40:27.616 --> 40:30.455
one of the most popular
board games in the world,

40:30.522 --> 40:35.598
sold in 114 countries and
printed in 47 languages.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.836
- You got the world
championships.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.573
Monopoly is a great diplomat.

40:39.673 --> 40:42.511
It unifies the players
who have never met

40:42.611 --> 40:45.985
from the various countries
because they know it.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.453
It's a common denominator.

40:51.494 --> 40:53.031
- [Narrator] Ironically,
the board game

40:53.197 --> 40:54.568
that celebrates capitalism

40:54.701 --> 40:56.605
has also brought
renewed attention

40:56.772 --> 40:59.143
to the story of Elizabeth Magie,

40:59.276 --> 41:01.312
the passionate social activist

41:01.379 --> 41:04.520
who invented the original
version, The Landlord's Game.

41:06.322 --> 41:09.228
- I've talked to so many girls
and women and game designers,

41:09.294 --> 41:11.031
and Lizzie Magie is an
important North Star.

41:11.298 --> 41:14.037
I think it's really important
to see representation

41:14.304 --> 41:16.910
and see people like her who
just keep charging through

41:16.943 --> 41:21.384
to make their ambitions and
their ideas become a reality.

41:22.252 --> 41:24.157
(flames crackling)

41:24.256 --> 41:26.795
- [Narrator] In 1861,
the modern board game

41:26.928 --> 41:29.700
was born out of one
man's desperation.

41:31.571 --> 41:34.577
But today, Milton
Bradley's inspiration

41:34.643 --> 41:38.717
has grown into a global
$10-billion-a-year industry.

41:41.556 --> 41:43.260
- Board games give families,

41:43.326 --> 41:45.296
especially these days
with all the screens,

41:45.395 --> 41:48.903
opportunities to sit down
and to play together.

41:50.005 --> 41:52.578
- It's amazing to me
that people predict

41:52.677 --> 41:55.481
old-fashioned board
games will go away.

41:55.582 --> 41:57.085
But I think board
games are important

41:57.085 --> 42:00.526
because they allow
people the luxury

42:00.626 --> 42:03.463
of actually communicating
with one another.

42:03.597 --> 42:05.735
It's not so much the game itself

42:05.835 --> 42:08.607
but the conversations that
happen around the game

42:08.741 --> 42:10.711
that make games so wonderful.

42:12.714 --> 42:17.658
(wheel clicking)
(reverent music)
