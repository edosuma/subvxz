02:01.881 --> 02:04.917
<i>Blue team in the
ICU, please. Blue team, ICU.</i>

02:35.480 --> 02:37.917
Ms. Ashland? I'm Omar.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.019
I'm the nurse
who's been taking care of you.

02:40.052 --> 02:42.989
You're at
Columbia Western Hospital.

02:43.022 --> 02:44.589
You're safe here.

02:44.623 --> 02:45.792
Are you comfortable?

02:47.827 --> 02:50.595
How about we take
these bandages off, huh?

02:50.630 --> 02:52.999
Ah...

02:58.037 --> 02:59.739
Why can't I see?

03:03.508 --> 03:05.410
I'll let your doctor know
you're ready.

03:07.512 --> 03:09.514
Back in two blinks.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.087
I understand
we're trying to reach

03:15.121 --> 03:16.756
your brother overseas.

03:17.924 --> 03:18.958
<i>Japan, is it?</i>

03:22.929 --> 03:26.098
- Look at me, please.
- Is that really necessary?

03:26.132 --> 03:28.801
Not sure. Doctors on TV do it.

03:28.835 --> 03:31.137
What is happening?
Who did this to me?

03:31.170 --> 03:32.638
Ah!

03:32.672 --> 03:34.506
Now the chemicals
that you were exposed to

03:34.539 --> 03:37.076
left your optic nerve intact,
but seared.

03:37.109 --> 03:40.012
In simple terms,
and I'm so sorry to say this,

03:40.046 --> 03:42.447
uh, but the damage
is irreversible.

04:06.138 --> 04:08.774
How tall would you say
he or she was?

04:08.808 --> 04:11.043
- He.
- Could be either.

04:11.077 --> 04:13.112
It felt like a man.

04:14.446 --> 04:16.148
This medication.

04:16.182 --> 04:18.583
Is there anything else
of value in your car?

04:20.485 --> 04:22.855
- My Ruggieri.
- What's that?

04:22.889 --> 04:25.124
Other than tough to spell.

04:25.157 --> 04:28.560
Violin.
I just took it out of storage.

04:28.593 --> 04:30.595
- You'd say it's worth...
- Five-hundred thousand.

04:30.630 --> 04:35.134
Dollars?
No, we didn't see that.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.169
And still no trace
of your phone?

04:37.203 --> 04:39.105
- Treating this as a robbery...
- <i>It wasn't.</i>

04:39.138 --> 04:43.009
I told you, he came for me

04:43.042 --> 04:45.510
to do this to me.

04:46.712 --> 04:48.480
Did some reading
on your husband.

04:48.513 --> 04:50.950
Ex-husband.

04:50.983 --> 04:53.585
No shortage of people he upset.

04:53.618 --> 04:56.856
Or there's your celebrity.
Before him.

04:56.889 --> 04:59.491
Any interesting fans, ever?

04:59.524 --> 05:00.960
Haven't been famous
in a long time.

05:00.993 --> 05:03.963
But <i>that famous?</i>
It ever go away?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.802
Can we...

05:09.835 --> 05:12.972
We'll speak again soon.
We'll find this guy.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.741
And in the meantime,

05:15.775 --> 05:19.245
let yourself adjust
to your new world.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.479
Let your senses get caught up.

05:36.162 --> 05:37.763
We got your brother.

05:38.798 --> 05:39.832
Here.

05:49.574 --> 05:50.676
Hello.

05:53.611 --> 05:55.781
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

05:55.815 --> 05:58.217
- <i>Ellen, you there?</i>
- Easton?

05:58.250 --> 06:01.854
<i>Ellen, Christ.
I can't believe that...</i>

06:01.887 --> 06:04.290
This is what it takes
for us to talk?

06:04.323 --> 06:06.591
<i>I guess so.</i>

06:06.624 --> 06:09.161
<i>I've hired your care
for two months until I'm back.</i>

06:09.195 --> 06:12.298
<i>He's on the line with us.
Mr. Haley, are you there?</i>

06:12.331 --> 06:14.200
<i>Clayton, please.</i>

06:14.233 --> 06:16.135
<i>Ms. Ashland, hello.</i>

06:16.168 --> 06:17.737
<i>I was just about
to tell my sister</i>

06:17.770 --> 06:19.271
<i>how you come
highly recommended.</i>

06:19.305 --> 06:21.707
<i>And your specialty...</i>

06:21.741 --> 06:24.777
<i>people transitioning
into a new...</i>

06:24.810 --> 06:27.612
- <i>Handicap?</i>
- <i>Lifestyle.</i>

06:27.646 --> 06:30.082
<i>Think I found you
an apartment near downtown.</i>

06:30.116 --> 06:31.684
<i>Can tell you all about it,</i>

06:31.717 --> 06:35.553
<i>but just know
that it's safe, quiet.</i>

06:35.587 --> 06:36.889
<i>What you need.</i>

07:05.918 --> 07:07.286
Yes?

07:07.319 --> 07:09.922
We spoke yesterday.
I'm Clayton.

07:09.955 --> 07:11.924
I hope I didn't startle you,
I let myself in.

07:11.957 --> 07:15.361
- Where am I?
- Home. For now.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.364
It's apartment 902.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.598
I can come back later,
it's no problem.

07:21.834 --> 07:22.802
Wait.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.771
Come in.

07:28.774 --> 07:31.877
It's nice to meet you,
Ms. Ashland.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.279
Sun's out today.

07:33.312 --> 07:36.715
Bet you're happy
to be out of the hospital.

07:36.749 --> 07:41.287
This place kinda reminds me
of that story... <i>The Veldt?</i>

07:41.320 --> 07:43.722
- I think it's by Bradbury.
- What?

07:43.756 --> 07:46.792
Uh, this family,
in their luxurious home,

07:46.826 --> 07:49.895
a-anything the kids imagined,
the house brings to life.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.864
How'd I get here?

07:51.897 --> 07:55.134
We took a town car
to the city, right?

07:55.167 --> 07:58.971
Yeah, well, these would kick
a linebacker's ass.

08:01.373 --> 08:03.976
My brother described photos.

08:04.009 --> 08:06.979
Living room, kitchen.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.682
But in here?

08:09.715 --> 08:12.351
Bathroom straight ahead,
hallway on the right,

08:12.384 --> 08:15.087
window on your left.

08:15.121 --> 08:18.824
Colors of this room
are shades of blue,

08:18.858 --> 08:20.192
meant to soothe.

08:20.226 --> 08:21.827
And you?

08:21.861 --> 08:24.797
Ooh. Who do I want to be today?

08:24.830 --> 08:27.967
If I said a young Brando,
would that make it easier?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.869
Maybe for you.

08:29.902 --> 08:33.272
Look, I know you hate this,
and you can hate me, too,

08:33.305 --> 08:35.841
but I'm the easiest part
of this puzzle.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.743
I graduated
top of my nursing class.

08:37.776 --> 08:39.712
I've worked with plenty
of patients like you before,

08:39.745 --> 08:42.715
legally-blind, deaf,
young, old.

08:42.748 --> 08:45.284
I'm the Ferrari
of personal care.

08:49.021 --> 08:51.857
Uh, how does lunch in 30 sound?

08:51.891 --> 08:54.226
- Not hungry.
- Mm, you gotta eat.

08:54.260 --> 08:57.029
I'll take it in here.

08:57.062 --> 09:00.166
This place is nice,
but it isn't the Ritz.

09:00.199 --> 09:01.700
Kitchen in 30.

10:06.932 --> 10:08.767
There she is.

10:08.801 --> 10:10.336
Don't do that.

10:10.369 --> 10:13.038
Sorry, it's just that
you snuck up on me.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.840
On you?

10:14.873 --> 10:18.143
Why don't you have
some of this garlic penne,

10:18.177 --> 10:22.214
and then we'll get
a lay of the land?

10:22.248 --> 10:24.316
<i>I'm here weekdays
11:00 to 2:00, for now.</i>

10:24.350 --> 10:26.318
<i>Rejoice or shudder
at that thought.</i>

10:26.352 --> 10:29.121
<i>I'll let myself in, I'll tend
to cooking, some cleaning,</i>

10:29.154 --> 10:31.390
<i>but I'm mostly here
to help in the capital A</i>

10:31.423 --> 10:33.325
<i>adjustment department.</i>

10:33.359 --> 10:36.195
<i>Losing your sight doesn't mean
you have to lose yourself.</i>

10:36.228 --> 10:37.396
<i>You can do all the things
you love,</i>

10:37.429 --> 10:40.032
<i>that you're good at, and more.</i>

10:40.065 --> 10:42.301
<i>And down the line,
I'll teach you Braille,</i>

10:42.334 --> 10:45.371
<i>your cane, dictation software.</i>

10:45.404 --> 10:48.007
Eleven calls building security.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.809
Twenty two gets my cell.

10:50.843 --> 10:53.145
Programmed here
and the master bedroom.

10:53.178 --> 10:58.017
I am off to the finicky
Mr. Hudson on Mercer Island,

10:58.050 --> 11:00.986
unless you need anything else.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.555
It's been my pleasure,
Ms. Ashland.

11:03.589 --> 11:06.058
<i>Hasta manana.</i>

11:16.402 --> 11:18.370
<i>Hi, you've reached Sasha.</i>

11:18.404 --> 11:20.105
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

11:20.139 --> 11:21.473
Third time trying.

11:23.175 --> 11:26.245
I can't reach my brother,
his work,

11:26.278 --> 11:29.114
time zones. I get it.

11:29.148 --> 11:32.217
But you? Where are you?

11:34.920 --> 11:37.056
I hate it here.

11:37.089 --> 11:40.426
It feels so... empty.

11:42.094 --> 11:43.395
It isn't home.

11:46.231 --> 11:47.433
I miss you.

13:13.018 --> 13:14.486
<i>I got you something.</i>

13:17.423 --> 13:20.025
- I can take her back.
- No, no.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.295
What color?

13:23.328 --> 13:25.464
What do you want it to be?

13:25.497 --> 13:28.635
- It doesn't matter what I want.
- Sure it does.

13:28.668 --> 13:31.069
And you see her in your head,

13:31.103 --> 13:35.607
so your imagination's
either free in there or...

13:35.642 --> 13:39.144
Opposite of free
is captive.

13:39.178 --> 13:42.448
Which you would know
something about?

13:42.481 --> 13:46.618
Mm-mm. Other than
you as my cell mate?

13:46.653 --> 13:48.688
I've had to use my imagination.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.492
Might as well redecorate
the whole place in my head

13:53.525 --> 13:55.093
while we're at it.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.632
What color is she?

13:59.666 --> 14:01.233
Baby blue.

14:07.674 --> 14:09.541
You gonna name her?

14:09.575 --> 14:11.109
We just did.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.412
Put a mirror in there, will you?

14:13.445 --> 14:15.447
Let her recognize something.

14:15.481 --> 14:16.649
Sure.

14:19.686 --> 14:21.086
Come here.

14:26.659 --> 14:28.193
How come I can hear all this...

14:35.133 --> 14:37.770
still loud and clear?

14:37.804 --> 14:39.605
- If it's overkill, y...
- Shh!

14:45.210 --> 14:46.612
But here...

14:53.619 --> 14:55.655
This is thicker glass.

14:57.289 --> 15:00.660
Faces west,
and wind coming off the bay.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.296
You got a voicemail.

15:06.666 --> 15:07.667
<i>Ms. Ashland,</i>

15:07.700 --> 15:09.535
<i>it's Detective Bryce.</i>

15:09.568 --> 15:12.137
<i>I've looked into the clients
of your husband,</i>

15:12.170 --> 15:14.373
<i>and everyone checks out so far.</i>

15:14.406 --> 15:16.575
<i>Forensics couldn't pull
any unusual fingerprints</i>

15:16.608 --> 15:18.811
<i>from your car,
but there are boot treads</i>

15:18.845 --> 15:22.114
<i>we're looking into.
Think of anything, call me.</i>

15:28.688 --> 15:31.123
Your brother told me
how it happened.

15:33.392 --> 15:36.863
Hey, it's okay, you're safe.
No one's gonna find you here.

15:36.896 --> 15:38.297
Castle keep.

15:39.598 --> 15:41.066
Heard that before.

15:43.535 --> 15:46.438
- Bennett.
- The ex?

15:46.471 --> 15:50.843
His words, "You hang with me,
you're safe with me."

15:50.877 --> 15:53.713
- You googled us?
- None of my business. Ah.

15:55.614 --> 15:57.349
Maybe.

15:57.382 --> 16:00.319
Yeah, it's kinda
the first thing I did.

16:00.352 --> 16:02.354
Tend to find yourself
on scorched earth

16:02.387 --> 16:05.591
when you steal
other people's life savings.

16:05.624 --> 16:07.593
Except Sasha.

16:07.627 --> 16:09.829
She's the only friend
who stuck around...

16:11.430 --> 16:13.231
even after what we did to her.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.667
We?

16:14.701 --> 16:16.568
The kind of money he made
for everyone...

16:16.602 --> 16:18.771
- Nobody questioned it.
- Who'd want to?

16:18.805 --> 16:22.541
- And now he's...
- Serving 15.

16:22.574 --> 16:24.543
Pissed off someone
who can't get to him,

16:24.576 --> 16:26.779
so they're after me, instead.

16:26.813 --> 16:28.313
And if I couldn't see them
the first time...

16:28.347 --> 16:30.582
Okay. Enough.

16:30.616 --> 16:31.684
Sit.

16:38.758 --> 16:40.525
Look, I know it's hard,

16:40.559 --> 16:43.763
but no amount of anger
is going to save you.

16:43.796 --> 16:47.834
Optimism, passion,
who you were before him...

16:47.867 --> 16:49.201
Ended.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.170
Music?

16:53.673 --> 16:56.709
The violin.
Your album went gold.

16:56.743 --> 17:00.947
I saw the videos, child prodigy
sells out London, Prague,

17:00.980 --> 17:02.882
moves people to tears.

17:02.915 --> 17:05.317
<i>Who you were,
the original Ellen...</i>

17:05.350 --> 17:07.887
Ended with it. Can we not?

17:14.761 --> 17:16.194
All I'm saying is,
you might not know...

17:16.228 --> 17:17.496
Can we not?

17:20.365 --> 17:23.201
Definitely not the Ritz.

17:33.545 --> 17:34.579
Salt.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.959
I'm sorry.

17:46.993 --> 17:48.828
I'm no good like this.

18:04.944 --> 18:09.247
I am going
to leave you with this.

18:09.281 --> 18:10.983
Because I value
my personal safety,

18:11.017 --> 18:13.753
I wouldn't dare force a lesson
on you just yet.

18:13.786 --> 18:15.253
<i>Au revoir?</i>

20:11.938 --> 20:13.371
<i>You've
reached the security office</i>

20:13.405 --> 20:14.406
<i>for The Lacuna Center...</i>

20:27.053 --> 20:28.988
<i>Hi, you've reached Sasha.</i>

20:29.021 --> 20:30.957
<i>I'll get back to you...</i>

22:13.926 --> 22:15.695
<i>Ellen...</i>

22:25.137 --> 22:26.906
<i>You okay?</i>

22:26.939 --> 22:29.541
Didn't mean to. Night.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.702
Hello?

23:15.354 --> 23:17.957
I'm not gonna
tell you again!

23:34.807 --> 23:37.043
What she needs
someone!

23:37.076 --> 23:38.844
Do you know what you've done?

23:38.878 --> 23:41.579
I told you to stay away
from her, okay?

23:41.613 --> 23:45.017
She's drugged,
she's dangerous. She's a drunk.

23:45.051 --> 23:48.254
- She needs help!
- I told you!

23:52.291 --> 23:54.160
Your senses have gone into...

23:54.193 --> 23:55.995
I swear,
it was like she was in here.

23:56.028 --> 23:57.930
Into overdrive.

23:57.963 --> 24:00.266
You told me I could reach
security if I dialed 11.

24:00.299 --> 24:03.202
That's what security told me.
Did you hit the right button?

24:03.235 --> 24:06.939
Okay, I'll talk to someone.

24:06.972 --> 24:10.209
Do yourself a favor,
focus on this side of the wall.

24:10.242 --> 24:13.212
And if you hear anything else,
Seattle's finest.

24:16.082 --> 24:19.218
I was thinking
we could brave the lunch crowds

24:19.251 --> 24:21.220
and take a walk to the water.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.587
No.

24:23.722 --> 24:25.291
Sure.

24:25.324 --> 24:27.793
Can hit like a train
if you're not ready...

24:29.195 --> 24:30.830
world outside.

24:36.669 --> 24:38.370
World inside.

26:35.254 --> 26:37.022
Why would she leave
her balcony open

26:37.056 --> 26:38.057
on such a windy day?

26:38.090 --> 26:39.925
Okay, so this program...

26:39.959 --> 26:41.293
Maybe she couldn't get to it.

26:41.327 --> 26:43.028
...your Internet, your email...

26:43.062 --> 26:46.532
Maybe she was incapacitated.

26:46.565 --> 26:48.400
Okay.
Where do you get these ideas?

26:48.434 --> 26:52.838
Uh, so hit return
to start and stop,

26:52.871 --> 26:54.340
that'll read your email.

26:57.042 --> 27:00.012
<i>To Ellen
Ashland, from Easton Ashland.</i>

27:00.045 --> 27:03.549
<i>I'm writing you from
another rainy night in Tokyo.</i>

27:15.227 --> 27:17.529
<i>Want to learn this or not?</i>

27:22.001 --> 27:24.870
<i>Bo. Mo.</i>

27:29.375 --> 27:32.378
<i>Duck you.</i>

27:32.411 --> 27:36.448
Okay, let's go
to voice command mode.

27:36.482 --> 27:37.983
Voice command mode?

27:44.089 --> 27:47.393
- So, why this line of work?
- Um...

27:47.426 --> 27:51.063
The money can't be good
enough to put up with me.

27:51.096 --> 27:52.331
My mother...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.803
she was sick since I was little.

27:59.171 --> 28:01.573
Couldn't get out of bed.

28:01.607 --> 28:06.545
My dad didn't have to work,
like me, inheritance.

28:06.578 --> 28:09.281
So the only thing
he ever really got good at

28:09.315 --> 28:11.950
was drinking.

28:16.121 --> 28:21.026
When you grow up that way,
looking after her,

28:21.060 --> 28:23.329
and losing her to that...

28:25.564 --> 28:28.600
you wanna make yourself useful.

28:28.635 --> 28:31.403
Your imagination
get you through?

28:31.437 --> 28:33.005
She'd pass the days

28:33.038 --> 28:37.242
by making bird cages
from her bed.

28:37.276 --> 28:41.080
These huge, ornate things.

28:41.113 --> 28:43.148
And if it was exotic,
she had to have it.

28:43.182 --> 28:44.950
African Greys, macaws.

28:44.983 --> 28:48.187
I'd give them names
and personalities.

28:50.055 --> 28:53.292
I'd make my sister act out
all these stories with me.

28:53.325 --> 28:55.260
The whole flock.

28:55.294 --> 28:59.632
But it's-it's weirder still,
the job's not so different now.

28:59.666 --> 29:03.202
Every client
requires something tailor-made.

29:03.235 --> 29:06.538
Mr. Neilson in Ballard
gets one Clayton,

29:06.572 --> 29:08.607
Mrs. Woodsen on the water
requires another.

29:08.641 --> 29:11.410
And part of me just feels
I have to be all these things

29:11.443 --> 29:14.647
for all these people.

29:14.681 --> 29:17.383
And which Clayton do I get?

29:17.416 --> 29:20.986
Uh, that's the scary part.

29:21.019 --> 29:23.522
I think you get me.

29:45.645 --> 29:47.312
What are we looking at?

29:48.480 --> 29:49.948
Um...

29:52.752 --> 29:56.021
There's a couple
walking their sheep dog

29:56.054 --> 29:59.558
past a car that's been parallel
parking since the Ice Age.

29:59.591 --> 30:03.462
But looking up,
countless windows.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.202
Can I see you?

30:47.573 --> 30:50.677
Oh, it's half-past two.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.444
I should go.

30:52.478 --> 30:56.515
Uh... Sorry, I didn't...

31:00.118 --> 31:02.689
- Speak.
- <i>From Easton Ashland.</i>

31:02.722 --> 31:04.323
<i>How are you settling in?</i>

31:04.356 --> 31:06.525
<i>I'm going to find
a weekend to fly home.</i>

31:06.558 --> 31:08.193
Stop.

31:10.797 --> 31:14.667
- Who is it?
- You left me a note?

31:14.701 --> 31:16.769
Next door.

31:31.183 --> 31:32.384
I'm Lana.

31:33.753 --> 31:36.221
Brought tea.

31:36.255 --> 31:38.190
I don't...

31:38.223 --> 31:40.526
I can't see.

31:42.795 --> 31:44.129
I'm Ellen.

31:45.297 --> 31:47.266
Come in. I'll put some water on.

31:53.773 --> 31:55.207
Fancy art.

31:56.108 --> 31:57.576
Matches the music.

31:59.144 --> 32:01.613
You know I used to play?

32:01.648 --> 32:03.582
Mm, classical stuff I heard.

32:06.285 --> 32:08.153
Russo's got a painting
like this one.

32:08.186 --> 32:10.355
- Wasn't cheap.
- Russo?

32:11.758 --> 32:13.258
My husband.

32:14.861 --> 32:17.429
You just got here, hm?

32:17.462 --> 32:19.431
It's just temporary
for me here.

32:19.464 --> 32:22.434
My brother's in business
on Japan...

32:22.467 --> 32:24.871
My brother's in business...

32:24.904 --> 32:28.106
You mind if I...

32:28.140 --> 32:30.142
Not inside, thanks.

32:30.175 --> 32:34.146
- Nobody smokes in this city.
- Even my brother quit.

32:34.179 --> 32:37.182
Otherwise you'd have a cancer
partner when he visits...

32:37.215 --> 32:39.585
Smoking partner.

32:44.156 --> 32:45.557
Excuse me?

32:46.926 --> 32:51.129
You said smoking partner. Here.

32:51.163 --> 32:52.765
Well, I said my brother.

32:57.202 --> 33:00.172
- I miss him.
- Think he misses you?

33:02.441 --> 33:05.712
Of course he does. He must.

33:05.745 --> 33:07.179
W-why?

33:09.716 --> 33:11.149
Did it...

33:12.719 --> 33:14.654
Did it hurt?

33:14.687 --> 33:16.388
What?

33:16.421 --> 33:19.659
Your eyes, losing 'em.

33:19.692 --> 33:22.795
I didn't lose them.

33:22.829 --> 33:24.463
Your sight, I-I mean.

33:24.496 --> 33:27.332
I didn't <i>lose</i> anything.

33:27.366 --> 33:29.167
It was taken from me.

33:29.201 --> 33:31.938
I, I didn't mean...
I should probably...

33:31.971 --> 33:35.207
How'd you know
I ever had my sight?

33:35.240 --> 33:39.746
I didn't,
it's just I wondered

33:39.779 --> 33:43.281
who put those bruises there.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.784
You're right,
it's none of my business.

33:44.817 --> 33:48.420
- Oh, I didn't say that.
- No.

33:48.453 --> 33:50.657
- I'm making another mess.
- What do you mean, mess?

33:50.690 --> 33:53.525
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- What do you mean, mess?

33:54.961 --> 33:57.697
I know you heard me scream.

33:57.730 --> 34:01.299
My husband goes out of town
sometimes and I get sad.

34:01.333 --> 34:04.202
You're shaking.

34:07.874 --> 34:09.942
How old are you?

34:09.976 --> 34:11.811
None of your business.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.748
Forty eight.

34:15.782 --> 34:17.817
Why are you lying to me?

34:22.454 --> 34:25.490
Don't trust anyone.

34:31.664 --> 34:33.331
Wait.

34:35.534 --> 34:38.004
Wait!

34:38.037 --> 34:39.438
It's him.

34:51.616 --> 34:54.619
Yes. A scar. Fresh stitches.

34:54.654 --> 34:56.588
Her husband did that to her.

34:56.621 --> 34:59.391
- <i>I met him.</i>
- When?

34:59.424 --> 35:02.260
<i>Today. Left your place
as he was getting in.</i>

35:02.294 --> 35:04.262
<i>He asked if I was seeing
the guest in 902.</i>

35:04.296 --> 35:05.631
<i>He seemed nice enough.</i>

35:05.665 --> 35:07.633
Of course, he did.

35:07.667 --> 35:10.302
When she saw him,

35:10.335 --> 35:12.839
you didn't hear
the fear in her voice.

35:12.872 --> 35:14.841
<i>He apologized for the noise.</i>

35:14.874 --> 35:17.275
<i>He said
his wife hadn't been well.</i>

35:17.309 --> 35:19.511
Well, he speaks for her,
and you just believe him?

35:21.047 --> 35:22.815
Exactly.

35:34.627 --> 35:36.294
<i>Detective Bryce.</i>

35:52.111 --> 35:54.312
Hi there.

35:54.346 --> 35:55.648
Uh, my name's Officer Nieman.

35:55.681 --> 35:57.382
I'm responding
to a noise complaint

35:57.415 --> 35:59.351
at this address.

35:59.384 --> 36:02.822
<i>Officer Nieman
said she was lucid, calm.</i>

36:02.855 --> 36:04.489
<i>Didn't convey she was
in danger.</i>

36:04.523 --> 36:06.058
She was terrified.

36:06.092 --> 36:08.493
<i>I did a little digging,
and I'll confide.</i>

36:08.527 --> 36:10.830
<i>Mrs. Latch
has a bit of a history.</i>

36:10.863 --> 36:13.565
- <i>She's hurt herself before.</i>
- I-I heard her scream.

36:13.598 --> 36:15.768
She came to me frightened.

36:15.802 --> 36:18.336
The... The stitches?

36:18.370 --> 36:20.006
<i>Stitches?</i>

36:20.039 --> 36:21.974
- Her face.
- <i>Her scar?</i>

36:22.008 --> 36:24.509
<i>Long healed, or so Nieman says.</i>

36:24.543 --> 36:26.946
<i>Thought it was a birthmark.</i>

36:26.979 --> 36:29.782
No. I know what I felt.

36:32.685 --> 36:36.122
- How old is she?
- <i>Nieman said 48.</i>

36:36.155 --> 36:39.391
<i>She didn't tell you he hit her.</i>

36:39.424 --> 36:42.094
She said, "Don't trust anyone."

36:42.128 --> 36:46.833
<i>Does that sound like
a well person to you?</i>

37:00.813 --> 37:05.051
Two days ago. The same car,
same alarm, same time.

37:05.084 --> 37:06.853
How do you know?

37:06.886 --> 37:09.454
Happened right when
you got here, 11 a.m.

37:09.487 --> 37:12.557
Heard the alarm
as you rang the bell.

37:12.591 --> 37:15.460
Same siren?

37:15.493 --> 37:16.629
Alarm.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.564
Forget it.

37:19.598 --> 37:21.133
Look, I believe you.

37:21.167 --> 37:23.602
It's a big city,
it's got lots of alarms.

37:23.636 --> 37:25.037
You heard it all the way
up here?

37:25.071 --> 37:28.007
- Overdrive.
- Yeah.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.408
Uh, where do you want
this lighter?

37:30.442 --> 37:31.811
I don't.

37:32.912 --> 37:35.147
It's not mine.

37:35.181 --> 37:37.415
I mean, it was just sitting
right here.

37:45.892 --> 37:48.094
<i>10:57 a.m.</i>

37:50.062 --> 37:52.430
<i>11:02 a.m.</i>

38:04.110 --> 38:05.912
You hungry?

38:05.945 --> 38:09.215
Shh! Get in here.

38:13.252 --> 38:14.787
What kind of car?

38:15.988 --> 38:18.190
Hey, you were right.

38:18.224 --> 38:21.127
It's the same time?

38:21.160 --> 38:22.695
Why'd it stop?

38:23.729 --> 38:25.597
Some guy's getting in.

38:26.966 --> 38:30.468
Same time every other day.

38:32.738 --> 38:34.807
Looking for patterns
where there are none.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.208
It is a pattern.

38:36.242 --> 38:39.979
I get here for my job
as he takes off for his.

38:40.012 --> 38:44.817
Hey, you've got to take it easy
on yourself. Okay?

38:44.850 --> 38:46.919
The thing that saves you
isn't out there

38:46.953 --> 38:48.586
or at the bottom
of a cocktail glass.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.623
It's, uh, here.

38:56.996 --> 38:59.098
Your eyes won't ever be
what they were.

38:59.131 --> 39:03.669
But once the rest of you heals,
you won't need them to.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.615
<i>Ah! Help me.</i>

Are you all right?

41:36.822 --> 41:37.957
Hey.

41:39.291 --> 41:42.061
What?

41:42.094 --> 41:44.196
I'm sorry, I...

41:45.297 --> 41:47.700
You're her husband, aren't you?

41:48.968 --> 41:50.903
I can hear you breathing.

42:02.948 --> 42:04.316
I know she was here.

42:04.350 --> 42:06.452
- Don't come any closer.
- Oh, shut up.

42:06.485 --> 42:09.188
Guess it was too much to ask
for a normal neighbor.

42:09.221 --> 42:11.323
Think I'll speak to building
management about the policy

42:11.357 --> 42:13.826
on intrusive resident behavior,
because, personally,

42:13.859 --> 42:15.294
I feel like
this place is better off

42:15.327 --> 42:17.696
with one less paranoid bitch.

42:31.977 --> 42:35.214
Yes?

42:35.247 --> 42:37.449
<i>I've been outside
the past half an hour,</i>

42:37.483 --> 42:40.052
<i>working up the nerve to call.</i>

42:40.085 --> 42:44.123
He was here. Just now.

42:44.156 --> 42:46.825
- What?
- He threatened me.

42:46.859 --> 42:48.060
I'll talk to him
right God-damn now.

42:48.093 --> 42:50.162
No! Just...

42:52.064 --> 42:53.465
Wait.

42:53.499 --> 42:55.968
You were outside
working up the nerve to do what?

42:56.001 --> 42:57.870
- Ellen, what did he say to you?
- The nerve to call...

42:57.903 --> 42:59.805
- And tell me what? Clayton!
- Nothing.

42:59.838 --> 43:02.474
I can't accept payment from you
as your caretaker.

43:02.508 --> 43:06.979
I-I can't work for you
if I have feelings for you.

43:12.484 --> 43:16.855
Look, it's-it's unprofessional,
I know.

43:16.889 --> 43:20.025
But it's the truth,
and that's what you deserve.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.094
I can't have you relying on me.

43:24.029 --> 43:26.532
You can call it a crush, you can
call it whatever you want...

43:26.565 --> 43:28.901
I'll call you an asshole.

43:30.836 --> 43:33.305
- Please, just...
- For making me say this.

43:37.843 --> 43:38.978
I...

43:41.080 --> 43:43.816
I like the Ferrari.

43:50.923 --> 43:53.359
We can still do the same things.

43:53.392 --> 43:57.229
I can help you. I can make sure
that you're safe.

43:57.263 --> 44:00.065
Starting with the asshole
next door.

44:02.034 --> 44:05.437
We can do that as friends

44:05.471 --> 44:09.275
or maybe,
maybe something more.

44:10.309 --> 44:13.479
Oh, you're...

44:15.881 --> 44:17.950
I can't. I've been wrong
about everything.

44:17.983 --> 44:20.452
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't... I'm sorry.

44:20.486 --> 44:23.389
About next door, about you.

44:23.422 --> 44:26.492
We have got to start over
professionally.

44:28.193 --> 44:30.195
I need to rely on you

44:30.229 --> 44:33.932
more than whatever this is.

44:35.467 --> 44:37.202
Ellen, I made a mistake.

44:37.236 --> 44:38.237
Don't...

45:03.562 --> 45:05.364
<i>Hi, you've reached Sasha.</i>

45:05.397 --> 45:06.899
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

45:15.675 --> 45:17.142
Clayton?

45:30.222 --> 45:32.091
I'm sorry.

45:32.124 --> 45:35.361
I don't know how to do this.

45:35.394 --> 45:39.131
I can't get a hold of anyone,
no one visits me.

45:39.164 --> 45:40.566
Please stay.

45:43.102 --> 45:45.070
Don't make me apologize twice.

45:48.607 --> 45:49.975
Clayton?

45:54.113 --> 45:55.547
What do you want?

45:57.149 --> 45:58.283
Clayton?

45:59.551 --> 46:01.053
Clayton!

46:09.428 --> 46:11.530
<i>9-1-1.</i>

46:11.563 --> 46:13.399
<i>What's the nature
of your emergency?</i>

46:24.510 --> 46:28.046
Ellen. I'm a paramedic.

46:28.080 --> 46:32.117
Ellen? Ellen, can you hear me?

46:35.120 --> 46:38.223
You were bleeding from your
wrist, but I bandaged you up.

46:40.459 --> 46:42.194
Are you feeling all right?

46:43.395 --> 46:45.397
Your neck? It hurts?

46:47.299 --> 46:48.668
Not seeing anything.

46:48.701 --> 46:50.502
Are you looking at it?

46:53.172 --> 46:54.674
I'll be right back.

47:07.586 --> 47:09.656
I shouldn't have left you.

47:09.689 --> 47:12.524
- Oh.
- What happened? Hey. It's okay.

47:14.193 --> 47:16.428
You're all right.

47:16.462 --> 47:19.331
Hey, Detective Bryce drove in.

47:19.364 --> 47:21.366
I told him about next door.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.069
No, it wasn't him.

47:24.102 --> 47:26.071
It was the man from that night.

47:27.674 --> 47:31.610
Do you need to tell me anything
before you talk to him?

47:31.644 --> 47:33.212
You've been drinking.

47:33.245 --> 47:37.115
I've been worried
about the drinking.

47:37.149 --> 47:38.584
- We've all felt lost at some...
- Get away from me.

47:38.617 --> 47:40.419
No, Ellen, no. Stop.

47:41.754 --> 47:44.223
Do you know
where they'd take you?

47:44.256 --> 47:47.326
Do you really wanna be anywhere
but here in your condition?

47:52.498 --> 47:55.300
- He wants to talk to you alone.
- Then get him.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.269
And get everyone else
out of here.

48:06.846 --> 48:10.415
It's just the front door.
No sign of forced entry.

48:10.449 --> 48:12.618
Clayton locked it behind him.

48:12.652 --> 48:17.055
I heard it lock and unlock.

48:17.089 --> 48:18.825
Usually, the one
I would suspect here

48:18.858 --> 48:20.727
is the caretaker
of the blind woman he...

48:20.760 --> 48:22.494
It wasn't him, either.

48:22.528 --> 48:26.031
I said usually. How long
have you known Sasha Krenlin?

48:27.332 --> 48:28.801
- Three years.
- Rather...

48:28.835 --> 48:31.370
How well do you know her?

48:31.403 --> 48:33.539
She's a good friend.

48:33.572 --> 48:36.341
The boot treads
we pulled from beside your car

48:36.375 --> 48:39.311
were half a shoe size
smaller than yours.

48:39.344 --> 48:41.480
After I first spoke
to Ms. Krenlin,

48:41.513 --> 48:43.348
we haven't been able
to locate her.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.350
Left town in a rush.

48:45.384 --> 48:47.119
But not without leaving
ample shoe-prints

48:47.152 --> 48:48.554
outside her property.

48:48.587 --> 48:51.423
I'm gonna ask you to guess
what size they were.

48:51.456 --> 48:52.859
What are you saying?

48:52.892 --> 48:55.227
A restraining order
was taken out against her,

48:55.260 --> 48:59.097
six years ago, Vancouver,
for stalking a co-worker's wife.

48:59.131 --> 49:02.534
Charges were filed.
Aggravated assault.

49:02.568 --> 49:05.237
- She couldn't.
- But she has reason to.

49:06.605 --> 49:07.840
Oh, my God.

49:07.874 --> 49:10.342
This is not your fault.

49:11.744 --> 49:13.211
But tonight...

49:13.245 --> 49:14.681
She was wearing that mask again.

49:14.714 --> 49:16.883
- You saw it?
- I heard it.

49:16.916 --> 49:18.851
I heard her breathing
through it.

49:18.885 --> 49:21.821
That mask was the last thing
I ever saw

49:21.854 --> 49:23.355
and it'll be the first thing
you see

49:23.388 --> 49:24.791
when you review
the security footage.

49:24.824 --> 49:28.393
I have. For the hallway,
lobby, stairwells.

49:28.427 --> 49:31.163
Your caretaker
left this unit at 8:05 p.m.

49:31.196 --> 49:33.532
Few minutes later,
he let himself back in

49:33.565 --> 49:35.167
with a man from lobby security

49:35.200 --> 49:37.904
after 9-1-1 dispatch
alerted them of your call.

49:37.937 --> 49:39.906
- And?
- Cameras show no one else...

49:39.939 --> 49:41.708
Coming into this unit tonight.

49:41.741 --> 49:46.144
By all accounts,
you've been alone.

49:46.178 --> 49:47.613
You just said it was her.

49:47.647 --> 49:49.615
That night, we think.

49:49.649 --> 49:52.584
But tonight
someone broke in here,

49:52.618 --> 49:55.287
attacked me again!

49:55.320 --> 49:58.156
My God, next door, ask them.

49:58.190 --> 50:00.459
They told me they heard nothing.

50:00.492 --> 50:02.427
No shared wall with this room.

50:02.461 --> 50:04.664
The vent.

50:04.697 --> 50:07.399
They were playing my music.
You know that?

50:07.432 --> 50:10.469
Look, there's either a glitch
with the camera or...

50:10.502 --> 50:14.774
She was in here! She could've
come in through the balcony.

50:14.807 --> 50:16.341
We reviewed the tapes
from the roof.

50:16.375 --> 50:18.410
The space above you is empty.

50:19.544 --> 50:20.913
I can't do this.

50:26.618 --> 50:28.620
This intruder
didn't enter by force,

50:28.655 --> 50:31.390
didn't take anything,
didn't say anything.

50:31.423 --> 50:32.557
Did they?

50:35.227 --> 50:37.797
That window
doesn't make a sound.

50:37.830 --> 50:41.299
I hear the same alarm
at the same time.

50:42.702 --> 50:44.871
Lana's stitches.

50:44.904 --> 50:48.240
Now no one believes me.
I can't...

50:49.541 --> 50:51.276
This is what she wants,
isn't it?

50:51.309 --> 50:54.579
I'll let you rest, and I'll
check the cameras again.

50:56.314 --> 50:58.450
Thank Mr. Haley
for going to bat for you.

50:58.483 --> 51:02.287
Without him, I'd recommend
you be put on suicide watch.

51:04.256 --> 51:06.859
And if I may offer
the simplest explanation,

51:06.893 --> 51:10.328
in your virgin state
of being sightless,

51:10.362 --> 51:12.732
perception
won't always be reality.

51:24.911 --> 51:27.914
Perception is my only reality.

51:42.594 --> 51:46.231
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to wake you.

51:48.768 --> 51:51.369
Make it up to you
with an omelet?

51:51.403 --> 51:53.238
Take the day off.

51:55.007 --> 51:59.478
I'm going to... call my brother.

52:14.994 --> 52:17.462
We've all felt lost
at some point?

52:25.705 --> 52:29.709
Drop by later? Make a special
take-care-of-you dinner?

52:47.894 --> 52:50.062
Easton,

52:50.096 --> 52:52.564
you were right
about my marriage,

52:52.597 --> 52:56.068
and I was wrong to put
this distance between us.

52:56.102 --> 52:58.336
I'm sorry to do this to you.

52:59.672 --> 53:02.742
But it has nothing
to do with you.

53:02.775 --> 53:05.510
Clayton, we've hardly
come to know one other...

53:07.479 --> 53:11.050
<i>and you deserve someone
stronger than I am.</i>

53:11.083 --> 53:13.385
<i>Forgive me
for bringing you into this.</i>

53:15.087 --> 53:17.857
<i>Sasha...</i>

53:17.890 --> 53:20.492
<i>I chose not to see
what he was doing,</i>

53:20.525 --> 53:22.862
stealing from you.

53:25.097 --> 53:27.834
<i>Maybe I've had a hand
in what you've done to me...</i>

53:29.135 --> 53:31.536
but may you pay
for what you've done.

53:32.672 --> 53:34.907
I know I am...

53:34.941 --> 53:37.677
<i>I'm afraid
to fall asleep at night,</i>

53:37.710 --> 53:40.146
<i>terrified of the days
in between,</i>

53:40.179 --> 53:43.850
<i>unable to convince anyone
of anything I believe...</i>

53:46.152 --> 53:48.020
<i>even myself...</i>

53:52.591 --> 53:54.627
<i>which is what scares me most.</i>

54:01.033 --> 54:03.501
<i>Next door...</i>

54:03.535 --> 54:06.005
<i>Lana might be in trouble.</i>

54:10.910 --> 54:13.578
<i>Maybe now someone who can
make sense of it, will...</i>

54:14.747 --> 54:16.481
because I can't.

54:25.658 --> 54:26.959
<i>Not while I'm locked
in my own head</i>

54:26.993 --> 54:29.028
like a house with no windows...

54:33.766 --> 54:35.768
where any truth I look for...

54:41.240 --> 54:42.975
I can't find.

55:05.798 --> 55:07.133
I'm sorry.

55:10.169 --> 55:11.569
<i>And...</i>

55:12.738 --> 55:13.873
goodbye.

1:00:27.386 --> 1:00:29.755
- Clayton.
- Ellen.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:36.895
- How are you?
- Your husband around?

1:00:40.332 --> 1:00:42.167
He's waiting for me
down in the lobby.

1:00:42.201 --> 1:00:43.936
Down in the lobby?

1:00:49.475 --> 1:00:51.410
Trouble finding your keys?

1:00:51.443 --> 1:00:54.313
In here somewhere.

1:00:54.346 --> 1:00:57.549
Think I'd have heard them
by now.

1:00:57.583 --> 1:01:01.920
You know... it was nothing,
anyway.

1:01:04.990 --> 1:01:08.160
Unless there's something
I can help you with.

1:01:08.193 --> 1:01:10.129
You left something at my place.

1:01:19.138 --> 1:01:20.939
Darn.

1:01:20.973 --> 1:01:22.941
Give me a hand, would you?

1:01:27.479 --> 1:01:30.082
I went over the balcony.

1:01:30.115 --> 1:01:32.885
Lana, what is this place?

1:01:33.585 --> 1:01:34.920
Home.

1:01:36.922 --> 1:01:39.224
There are hidden cameras,
aren't there?

1:01:39.258 --> 1:01:40.893
Microphones?

1:01:40.926 --> 1:01:43.362
- Lana.
- Of course.

1:01:43.395 --> 1:01:45.297
And to make phone calls?

1:01:45.331 --> 1:01:50.135
Sasha, my brother, where did
he think he was sending me?

1:01:50.169 --> 1:01:52.037
- Why are you helping them?
- What?

1:01:52.071 --> 1:01:54.473
Clayton,
and the men helping him.

1:01:54.506 --> 1:01:57.142
How many of them are there?

1:01:57.176 --> 1:01:58.877
Why are they doing this?

1:01:58.911 --> 1:02:00.212
I-i-it's all for you.

1:02:00.245 --> 1:02:02.281
W-what did I do to them?

1:02:02.314 --> 1:02:04.216
To-to them?

1:02:05.551 --> 1:02:07.052
You saved them.

1:02:12.091 --> 1:02:13.525
I have to go.

1:02:17.596 --> 1:02:19.198
Wait.

1:02:19.231 --> 1:02:21.500
How do I get out of here?

1:02:29.041 --> 1:02:30.943
- Honey.
- What're you doing here?

1:02:30.976 --> 1:02:32.911
- Sorry.
- Car's waiting.

1:02:33.946 --> 1:02:35.314
Let's go.

1:02:35.347 --> 1:02:37.015
Goodbye, Ellen.

1:02:55.033 --> 1:02:57.603
Who's there?

1:02:57.637 --> 1:03:00.272
It's your personal chef.

1:03:00.305 --> 1:03:02.574
One special dinner coming up.

1:03:02.608 --> 1:03:04.410
Going to take care of me?

1:03:06.111 --> 1:03:07.613
If you'll let me.

1:03:12.384 --> 1:03:15.421
Your hand.
Can I take a look at that?

1:03:22.561 --> 1:03:24.997
Do I have to ask
if that's an accident?

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:29.702
Is this about Lana?

1:03:29.736 --> 1:03:31.503
I think it'd be wise if you had

1:03:31.537 --> 1:03:33.439
less interaction with her.

1:03:33.472 --> 1:03:36.275
You saw her just now
with her husband?

1:03:36.308 --> 1:03:37.677
I think if we look out
the window right now,

1:03:37.710 --> 1:03:40.379
we'll see them
getting into their car?

1:03:40.412 --> 1:03:42.314
I'd assume
they'd be gone by now.

1:03:42.347 --> 1:03:45.117
He told me they're going
up north for a few weeks.

1:03:45.150 --> 1:03:48.387
He's taking her away,
Russo, or whatever his name is,

1:03:48.420 --> 1:03:50.322
because she was about
to tell me more.

1:03:50.355 --> 1:03:51.691
What are you going to do to her?

1:03:51.724 --> 1:03:53.158
- What?
- What else?

1:03:53.192 --> 1:03:55.027
- Ellen...
- Detective Bryce.

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:57.162
That cop, Nieman,
you've all been lying to me

1:03:57.196 --> 1:03:58.497
since the moment
you brought me here.

1:03:58.530 --> 1:03:59.565
Maybe we should call
your brother

1:03:59.598 --> 1:04:01.266
or your doctor.

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.402
This place is a fucking lie,
and I wanna know why!

1:04:03.435 --> 1:04:05.304
Lana wasn't taken anywhere.

1:04:05.337 --> 1:04:08.207
- Her husband checked her out.
- What?

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:10.209
They're re-evaluating
her treatment.

1:04:10.242 --> 1:04:12.511
And next they're gonna talk
about re-evaluating yours.

1:04:12.544 --> 1:04:14.146
- Treatment?
- What do you think this is?

1:04:14.179 --> 1:04:18.116
- Ellen, Alcatraz?
- People visit Alcatraz.

1:04:18.150 --> 1:04:21.587
- What did Lana tell you?
- This was all for me.

1:04:21.620 --> 1:04:26.258
Patients like you and her,
paid for by your brother.

1:04:26.291 --> 1:04:28.527
You told me you see patients
all over the city!

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:29.729
Yeah, because I do, this isn't

1:04:29.762 --> 1:04:31.363
the only program
that I work for.

1:04:31.396 --> 1:04:33.065
You stood at that window

1:04:33.098 --> 1:04:35.167
and told me all about
the world out there!

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:37.302
Of course I did, with you.

1:04:37.336 --> 1:04:39.438
- To make it as real as possible.
- You're lying.

1:04:39.471 --> 1:04:42.074
To ease your transition
back into the real world,

1:04:42.107 --> 1:04:44.042
no matter how unorthodox
it may feel...

1:04:44.076 --> 1:04:46.178
- Stop lying!
- You suffer from PTSD...

1:04:46.211 --> 1:04:49.615
And you're newly blind.
Is that a lie?

1:04:49.649 --> 1:04:52.785
Ellen, I'm sorry about
this downturn in your recovery,

1:04:52.819 --> 1:04:54.754
really, I am. I failed you.

1:04:54.787 --> 1:04:56.355
- But that doesn't...
- I don't believe you!

1:04:56.388 --> 1:04:58.791
All this place is,
is to keep you safe.

1:04:58.825 --> 1:05:01.694
- I tried to kill myself!
- You tried.

1:05:05.698 --> 1:05:08.668
Ellen, you are hurt.

1:05:10.637 --> 1:05:12.137
You need help.

1:05:14.139 --> 1:05:15.374
You're right.

1:05:17.309 --> 1:05:18.745
I need help.

1:05:21.179 --> 1:05:23.115
That's what we're here for.

1:05:43.569 --> 1:05:45.504
I'll freshen up before dinner.

1:05:47.306 --> 1:05:49.776
I'll get started on that

1:05:49.809 --> 1:05:52.712
and the surprise
that makes it special.

1:06:38.691 --> 1:06:40.325
Have a seat.

1:07:12.692 --> 1:07:14.493
Put out your hands.

1:07:21.834 --> 1:07:23.903
Had it tuned and everything.

1:07:26.471 --> 1:07:28.407
I don't know what to say.

1:07:29.842 --> 1:07:32.712
Say nothing. Try playing.

1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:35.614
Why did you ever stop?

1:07:36.548 --> 1:07:37.884
My husband.

1:07:37.917 --> 1:07:41.553
But if there was
ever a way back to her...

1:07:42.955 --> 1:07:44.456
isn't this it,

1:07:44.489 --> 1:07:48.560
to that... original Ellen?

1:07:50.595 --> 1:07:53.465
This is all
part of the treatment?

1:07:53.498 --> 1:07:56.568
- You know any of my music?
- Oh, sure.

1:07:56.601 --> 1:07:58.403
Your rendition of the...

1:07:58.437 --> 1:08:00.439
- <i>Kreutzer Sonata.</i>
- <i>Kreutzer Sonata.</i>

1:08:18.457 --> 1:08:20.793
Back in two blinks.

1:08:24.463 --> 1:08:26.766
Back in two blinks.

1:08:26.799 --> 1:08:28.400
Usually,
the one I'd suspect here

1:08:28.433 --> 1:08:30.770
is the caretaker
of the blind woman.

1:08:30.803 --> 1:08:32.370
Wasn't him, either.

1:08:32.404 --> 1:08:34.539
I said usually.

1:08:34.573 --> 1:08:38.510
My mother, she was sick
since I was little.

1:08:40.713 --> 1:08:41.948
Is that really necessary?

1:08:41.981 --> 1:08:44.817
She'd pass the days by making

1:08:44.851 --> 1:08:48.553
<i>bird cages from her bed.</i>

1:08:48.587 --> 1:08:52.692
<i>I'd give them names,
personalities.</i>

1:08:52.725 --> 1:08:55.728
<i>Part of me just feels
I have to be all these things</i>

1:08:55.762 --> 1:08:57.063
<i>for all these people.</i>

1:08:57.096 --> 1:09:00.933
<i>The whole flock.</i>

1:09:00.967 --> 1:09:03.669
- Is that really necessary?
- I'm not sure.

1:09:03.703 --> 1:09:05.638
Doctors on TV do it.

1:09:07.039 --> 1:09:09.075
Back in two blinks.

1:09:09.108 --> 1:09:11.576
I'm a paramedic.

1:09:11.610 --> 1:09:13.880
Ellen, can you hear me?

1:09:13.913 --> 1:09:18.450
The one I'd suspect here is the
caretaker of the blind woman.

1:09:20.452 --> 1:09:21.888
<i>I feel like
this place is better off</i>

1:09:21.921 --> 1:09:23.856
with one less paranoid bitch.

1:09:28.694 --> 1:09:29.762
And which Clayton do I get?

1:09:29.796 --> 1:09:32.430
That's the scary part.

1:09:32.464 --> 1:09:35.433
I think you get me.

1:09:35.467 --> 1:09:40.338
Don't trust anyone.

1:09:40.372 --> 1:09:42.440
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

1:09:42.474 --> 1:09:43.676
Exactly what I was thinking.

1:09:43.709 --> 1:09:44.977
- Listen...
- Drinks?

1:09:47.546 --> 1:09:49.481
It's a special dinner, isn't it?

1:09:50.950 --> 1:09:52.417
Have a seat.

1:10:00.159 --> 1:10:02.327
Before the food cools off.

1:10:08.134 --> 1:10:09.969
Didn't tell you, did I?

1:10:11.904 --> 1:10:15.775
Finished your story. <i>The Veldt.</i>

1:10:15.808 --> 1:10:18.077
Had the computer
read it to me, anyway.

1:10:18.110 --> 1:10:20.680
There's hope for you yet.

1:10:20.713 --> 1:10:24.050
Didn't even know the Veldt meant
the plains in Africa.

1:10:24.083 --> 1:10:25.718
So that's what the kids want,

1:10:25.751 --> 1:10:28.921
and their house brings it
to life, in the nursery.

1:10:28.955 --> 1:10:30.890
The heat, the tall grass.

1:10:30.923 --> 1:10:33.960
- And that ending?
- The lions.

1:10:33.993 --> 1:10:36.128
Kind of depraved, isn't it?

1:10:40.199 --> 1:10:41.667
Don't you think?

1:10:46.038 --> 1:10:48.140
What?

1:10:48.174 --> 1:10:51.811
That the kids lock
mom and dad in the nursery?

1:10:51.844 --> 1:10:54.046
Or that the lions eat
mom and dad?

1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.616
No, that the kids
watch it happen...

1:10:58.951 --> 1:11:01.821
with smiles on their faces.

1:11:01.854 --> 1:11:03.823
Parents got what they deserved.

1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:09.996
- I'm sorry.
- I got it.

1:13:36.942 --> 1:13:38.978
<i>105 North Avenue, 52.</i>

1:14:01.634 --> 1:14:02.768
Lana?

1:14:28.994 --> 1:14:30.262
<i>Ellen!</i>

1:14:31.664 --> 1:14:33.232
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:14:35.401 --> 1:14:37.970
Wait.

1:14:46.912 --> 1:14:49.682
You didn't kill him,
did you?

1:14:49.715 --> 1:14:50.583
No.

1:14:52.351 --> 1:14:54.386
Which is why
we have to get out of here.

1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:55.421
You have to help me.

1:14:55.454 --> 1:14:59.091
I told you. This is home.

1:15:02.862 --> 1:15:05.431
Lana, what are you
talking about?

1:15:05.464 --> 1:15:08.134
He's all the family I have.

1:15:08.167 --> 1:15:09.869
You're his sister?

1:15:09.902 --> 1:15:12.104
This isn't what you want.

1:15:12.138 --> 1:15:14.373
You tried to warn me.

1:15:14.406 --> 1:15:18.043
I tried to stay quiet,
but we got you here.

1:15:18.077 --> 1:15:20.913
You were so real.

1:15:20.946 --> 1:15:23.382
You can't save me
like you saved him.

1:15:23.415 --> 1:15:26.619
- What did I save him from?
- Where you are now.

1:15:28.187 --> 1:15:30.389
The dark.

1:15:33.225 --> 1:15:34.360
Ellen!

1:15:36.328 --> 1:15:40.366
I know what it feels like to be
under someone else's control.

1:15:40.399 --> 1:15:43.169
Believe me, I've been there.

1:15:43.202 --> 1:15:46.005
But I'm going
to take my hand away.

1:15:46.038 --> 1:15:48.274
We're going to get out of here,

1:15:48.307 --> 1:15:51.043
and he never
gets to hurt you again.

1:15:58.417 --> 1:16:00.219
Only one way out.

1:16:03.122 --> 1:16:06.325
- For one of us.
- No, together.

1:16:06.358 --> 1:16:09.828
Go back the way you came.
There's a vent in his room.

1:16:09.862 --> 1:16:11.997
I hid it from him.

1:16:12.031 --> 1:16:15.067
The only way out.

1:16:15.968 --> 1:16:17.770
Go.

1:16:17.803 --> 1:16:19.371
Go, or I'll scream.

1:17:23.068 --> 1:17:26.405
Clayton, what happened to you?

1:17:31.277 --> 1:17:34.513
Everything changed

1:17:34.546 --> 1:17:36.815
the day my mother died.

1:17:36.849 --> 1:17:40.019
My father made us watch

1:17:40.052 --> 1:17:42.921
as he smashed her bird cages

1:17:42.955 --> 1:17:45.891
with the birds still inside.

1:17:45.924 --> 1:17:49.194
That made me angry.

1:17:51.163 --> 1:17:52.298
So he...

1:17:54.066 --> 1:17:56.869
dragged me by my hair

1:17:56.902 --> 1:17:58.570
into the cellar,

1:17:58.604 --> 1:18:01.273
and he locked me down there

1:18:01.307 --> 1:18:03.542
for three-and-a-half years.

1:18:03.575 --> 1:18:08.113
My only lifeline to the outside
was my imagination.

1:18:08.147 --> 1:18:10.349
And when I thought

1:18:10.382 --> 1:18:13.919
there was no end in sight...

1:18:13.952 --> 1:18:18.290
what I heard in the walls

1:18:18.324 --> 1:18:20.326
and the vents,

1:18:20.359 --> 1:18:23.329
what my sister
would play for me,

1:18:23.362 --> 1:18:25.130
when she could sneak it...

1:18:26.899 --> 1:18:31.003
the same music I used
to listen to with my mother.

1:18:35.274 --> 1:18:36.542
My music?

1:18:38.310 --> 1:18:40.312
My music?

1:18:40.346 --> 1:18:42.948
And you would never know
that you were the light for me

1:18:42.981 --> 1:18:46.251
in that black hole, until
I could be the same for you.

1:18:49.621 --> 1:18:52.524
I had this place
built for you...

1:18:53.959 --> 1:18:56.295
but you made it real.

1:18:56.328 --> 1:19:00.532
And now you'll have to believe
in it again,

1:19:00.566 --> 1:19:03.268
as you did before.

1:19:03.302 --> 1:19:06.605
Where you are is in your head.

1:19:09.341 --> 1:19:11.377
It doesn't have to be Seattle
outside the windows, either.

1:19:11.410 --> 1:19:14.046
I can take you anywhere.

1:19:15.247 --> 1:19:19.418
And I can be... anyone.

1:19:20.386 --> 1:19:21.620
Everyone.

1:19:35.033 --> 1:19:38.470
I'll make it real. Me and you.

1:19:47.714 --> 1:19:51.517
And only you.

1:19:55.688 --> 1:19:57.022
What?

1:19:57.055 --> 1:19:59.659
How else can I know you're real?

1:19:59.692 --> 1:20:01.593
That Clayton isn't part of...

1:20:01.628 --> 1:20:06.265
They belong to me.
I don't belong to them.

1:20:06.298 --> 1:20:08.635
You would have me, what,
get rid of them?

1:20:08.668 --> 1:20:11.203
You can't, can you?

1:20:11.236 --> 1:20:13.105
They were all you had
in the dark.

1:20:13.138 --> 1:20:15.274
You, you were all I had!

1:20:15.307 --> 1:20:18.544
Then help me, Clayton.

1:20:18.577 --> 1:20:22.381
Be that original Ellen.

1:20:22.414 --> 1:20:25.217
Why can't the man I'm falling
for be himself with me?

1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:29.722
And only himself?

1:20:38.631 --> 1:20:41.500
Ellen!

1:21:46.699 --> 1:21:49.769
The only way out.

1:22:07.854 --> 1:22:09.789
Ellen?

1:22:09.822 --> 1:22:12.725
Ellen? Ellen!

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:43.589
Back in the cage, little bird.

1:22:52.865 --> 1:22:54.600
What did you do?

1:23:45.350 --> 1:23:46.618
No, no, no...

1:23:47.954 --> 1:23:50.389
- Clayton.
- Lana?

1:23:53.458 --> 1:23:54.694
Where is she?

1:23:55.862 --> 1:23:57.697
Where is she? Where's Ellen?

1:24:00.833 --> 1:24:02.534
You let her go.

1:24:04.436 --> 1:24:06.471
Give her back to me.

1:24:06.505 --> 1:24:07.974
Give her back.

1:24:08.007 --> 1:24:10.877
You don't leave me. You promised
you wouldn't leave me.

1:24:10.910 --> 1:24:13.378
You promised
you wouldn't leave me.

1:24:16.849 --> 1:24:19.217
Not like this, not like this.
Don't leave me.

1:24:22.621 --> 1:24:24.891
What's happening? What's
happening? What's happening?

1:24:25.792 --> 1:24:27.492
Help!

1:26:05.758 --> 1:26:08.661
Ms. Ashland, do you need a hand?
