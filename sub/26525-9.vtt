WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:04.221
My name is John Deegan,
and I'm from Gotham,

00:04.265 --> 00:07.355
a city in grave need
of heroes.

00:07.398 --> 00:10.488
As a doctor at Arkham Asylum,
I did my part

00:10.532 --> 00:13.187
by protecting this city
from the criminally insane.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.840
[electricity buzzing]

00:14.884 --> 00:17.321
The world didn't understand
my methods,

00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
so I worked in secret
until, one day,

00:19.106 --> 00:22.935
when a cosmic being
recognized my potential

00:22.979 --> 00:25.895
and gave me the chance
to be something greater.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.507
Someone greater.

00:29.551 --> 00:33.511
Now, I am Superman.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.426
[Oliver] Previously
onArrow andFlash...

00:35.470 --> 00:37.037
The world thinks

00:37.080 --> 00:38.777
that you're Oliver Queen
and that I'm Barry Allen,

00:38.821 --> 00:40.910
and I would really
like to know why.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.869
[Barry] So what's
our next move?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.523
We're going to Gotham City.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.221
Who are you
and why are you helping us?

00:47.264 --> 00:49.049
Kane. Kate Kane.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.879
[Barry] He calls
himself the Monitor.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.621
He's been unleashing
the Book of Destiny

00:56.665 --> 00:59.972
across the multiverse
to test different Earths.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.714
[the Monitor] A crisis is
imminent. Someone is coming.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.413
Someone far, far
more powerful than myself.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.458
I mean to prepare.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.638
He did it again.
He rewrote reality.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.773
[whooshing]

01:19.427 --> 01:20.819
[all] Superman!

01:31.003 --> 01:33.093
There's no place you can run
where I can't find you.

01:34.485 --> 01:35.660
It's over.

01:35.704 --> 01:36.922
What're you talking about?

01:36.966 --> 01:39.099
Clark, it's us.
Barry and Oliver.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.926
Oh, I know who you are.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.493
Your confusion lies with me.

01:43.842 --> 01:44.887
Deegan.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.672
The Monitor
gave you the book back?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.805
And showed me
how to really use it.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.024
You can't just
write yourself as a hero.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.156
It doesn't work that way.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.201
Doesn't it, though?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.854
You were struck by lightning.

01:55.898 --> 01:59.380
I was given the book
by a higher power.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.817
Both random acts of chance.

02:01.860 --> 02:06.822
But this, this is my destiny.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.520
So much more than becoming
the Flash was ever yours.

02:09.564 --> 02:13.002
People don't become heroes
because of circumstance.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.265
They become heroes
in spite of circumstance.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.529
You're just a cheap knockoff.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.791
Oh, I'm anything but cheap.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.062
And just wait till you see
what other fun changes
I've made.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
To your family, your friends.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.328
There is no
safe harbor for you.

02:34.371 --> 02:37.983
This is no longer your world.
It's mine!

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
[both groaning]

02:46.383 --> 02:47.776
[creaking]

02:48.646 --> 02:50.170
Hey. I have an idea.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.088
Idiot, I'm bulletproof.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.133
I know.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.706
[people screaming]

03:04.749 --> 03:06.273
[Barry] You wanna be
Earth's hero?

03:06.316 --> 03:08.449
Save the children or stop us.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.408
Your choice, Superman.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.286
[people screaming]

03:36.694 --> 03:37.956
[panting]

03:38.000 --> 03:39.915
Being bad makes me
feel bad, man.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.264
The crane gag was harmless.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.396
It would've landed
in an empty parking lot.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.919
Still, man. I don't know.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.268
Just doing something
like that on purpose,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.009
I think I'm gonna puke.
I'm... [gags]

03:47.052 --> 03:49.011
-[police siren wailing]
-No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.796
We need to find out
how extensive
this reality-change is,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.755
-and we need to
get off the streets. Come on.
-[Barry retching]

03:53.798 --> 03:56.279
I can't get anything
coming up. I can't...

03:56.323 --> 03:57.541
Wait up. I have a plan.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.764
-[John] Congratulations, sir.
-The way you caught
that crane,

04:02.807 --> 04:04.200
like it weighed nothing.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.549
Very, very impressive.

04:07.812 --> 04:11.512
The fugitives escaped!

04:11.555 --> 04:14.515
Sir, we are quite sure
you will bring them
back to justice.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.431
No one can escape Superman.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.346
[breathing heavily]
You really think so?

04:19.389 --> 04:21.261
Sir, you are far too powerful.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.699
Ah, you're right.
You're right.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.789
[system beeping]

04:27.832 --> 04:29.704
Sir, the pipeline.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.314
Must be subject one.
She's been making noise
all morning.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.316
-I'll handle this.
-No!

04:33.360 --> 04:35.579
You stay on Allen and Queen.
I'll handle her.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.279
[door opens]

04:51.856 --> 04:53.858
I know the real man
who wears that glyph.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.513
It's not you.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.082
You're not Superman.

05:00.125 --> 05:03.999
And yet, I am all
that you once were.

05:04.042 --> 05:08.090
No offense to Barry Allen,
but as a hero, you...

05:08.133 --> 05:11.833
You are so much more
than just faster
than a speeding bullet.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.531
So, you're imitating my powers
and my family crest,

05:14.575 --> 05:16.707
but not my gender?

05:16.751 --> 05:20.711
-Too afraid to be a woman?
-Oh, I'm not afraid
of anything.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.105
The Book of Destiny
revealed to me
all there is to know about

05:23.148 --> 05:27.283
Barry Allen and Oliver Queen,
but for you
and this Man of Steel,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.547
there was nothing.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.984
Nothing but the android
you fought in Central City.
It's...

05:34.682 --> 05:37.075
It's as if you don't exist
in this world.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.252
That's why you locked me up
and dampened my powers.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.471
I don't know who you are.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.082
I don't know how you got here,

05:44.126 --> 05:47.259
but none of that matters
because I am now you.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.261
New and improved.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.700
And you will never see
the light of day again.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.790
I'm gonna stop you.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.184
There's nothing to stop.
I am the hero
this planet needs.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.319
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[groaning]

06:08.716 --> 06:10.152
Thank you, Agent Danvers.

06:16.245 --> 06:21.642
These cells
are patrolled 24/7,
so don't get any bright ideas,

06:21.685 --> 06:25.428
or you will end up
hurting in a very painful way.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.996
The only way
out of here for you
is in a casket.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.006
Wait! Alex.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.660
Oh...

06:41.357 --> 06:43.794
Oh, you think
you know that agent.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.667
You see, I scrambled
the reality of everyone
on this Earth.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.973
No one is who they were.

06:49.017 --> 06:53.282
But [laughs] I guess
even rewritten destiny
has a way of playing jokes.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.372
You be a good prisoner,

06:57.678 --> 06:59.854
or I kill her.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.943
-You're a monster.
-No.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.554
I'm Superman.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.349
-Okay, we--
-Get Cisco,
breach to Earth-38,

07:17.393 --> 07:18.438
find real Superman.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.004
That's the plan.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.050
As long as this Cisco's
willing to help us.

07:22.093 --> 07:25.445
The last alternate version
of Cisco I met
was not super-helpful.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.403
Who knows how he's been
rewritten this time?

07:33.061 --> 07:34.105
[the Monitor] Gentlemen.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.242
It's time we talked
about your destiny.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.029
I must confess,

07:45.073 --> 07:47.205
my interest is piqued.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.294
You possess neither power
nor abilities,

07:49.338 --> 07:51.775
yet still managed
to outwit an opponent

07:51.819 --> 07:54.691
with the powers
of a super man.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.345
It's just one word,
"Superman."

07:57.781 --> 07:59.696
What is this?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.699
Hmm? If you're testing us,
then let us get back to it.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.049
Oliver Queen,

08:05.093 --> 08:09.532
a man who channels
his hubris and anger
and calls it strength.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.839
Are you truly
that eager to die?

08:14.276 --> 08:16.496
No. Not eager.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.454
But willing.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.804
Ready to.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.067
Good.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.243
There might be hope
for this universe yet.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.637
If that's supposed to be
a pep talk, I've had better.

08:27.681 --> 08:31.598
Self-sacrifice alone
will not see you
through this trial.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.862
Survival will only be found
by knowing your true self,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.691
or this world will be doomed,

08:39.606 --> 08:40.998
like all the others.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.347
Okay, that's enough.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.484
Well, that was very
glass-half-empty.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.964
We need to find Cisco.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.009
Okay, well,
if us good guys are bad guys,

08:52.053 --> 08:55.839
stands to reason
that our good-guy friend
is now a bad guy.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.712
Sure. You're CCPD.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.496
Where do criminals
hang out in this city?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.412
[rock music playing]

09:10.680 --> 09:13.683
-Are they all afraid of us?
-Go with it.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.164
-This is a terrible idea.
-You keep saying that.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.861
[Barry]
And yet, here we are anyway.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.690
-We need allies and resources.
-[scoffs]

09:22.562 --> 09:24.868
Oh, my God, the Trigger Twins.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.916
Sorry, I'm just a huge fan
of your criminal history.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.658
You guys are my heroes.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.051
Well, not heroes. Legends.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.184
Can I get you guys something?

09:36.227 --> 09:37.968
Apparently, we need
allies and resources.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.277
We're looking for Cisco Ramon.

09:43.713 --> 09:44.714
You mean the boss?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.281
Sure.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
[blowing]

10:02.950 --> 10:04.734
[cracks softly]

10:04.778 --> 10:06.214
Well, that's not nothing.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.258
[door opens]

10:11.262 --> 10:12.263
Alex.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.225
How do you know my name?

10:17.268 --> 10:18.618
I'm not from this Earth.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.622
Where I come from,
we're sisters.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.232
[scoffs]

10:24.275 --> 10:29.106
You? You are as
despicable as they come.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.240
I mean, the stories
of all the twisted things
that you've done...

10:32.283 --> 10:34.416
Alex, I know things look
one way to you,

10:34.459 --> 10:35.765
that I look one way to you,

10:35.809 --> 10:38.986
but the way things are,
it's not real.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.641
Not really real.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.251
And if you just
let me explain,
I can tell you--

10:43.294 --> 10:46.646
You are dangerous,
and you are clearly crazy,

10:46.689 --> 10:48.735
and I have work to do.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.694
No, wait. Wait,
just let me explain.
I can tell you everything.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.919
[rock music playing]

10:58.962 --> 11:00.703
[Oliver]
We need to talk.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.923
Make an appointment
with my assistant.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.666
I should have an opening
around "go screw yourself."

11:06.709 --> 11:09.364
Cisco, we need your help.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.802
Listen.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.848
I don't know
who you think you are.

11:14.891 --> 11:18.112
But around here,
people call me Mr. Ramon.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.722
You got a problem there,
Mr. Ramon?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.683
Case in point.

11:23.726 --> 11:27.774
Jimmy, I think
the Pet Shop Boys
here need an education

11:27.817 --> 11:29.863
in how things
work around here.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.952
I don't think
that should be a problem.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.258
They don't call me
Superman's worst pal
for nothing.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.787
Look, we don't want
any trouble.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.050
We just have
a business proposal
for Mr. Ramon.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.531
Business proposal.
I'm gonna pass.

11:46.575 --> 11:51.580
You see, I like watching
my people put a beating
on other people. So...

11:51.623 --> 11:53.887
So, I guess we got that
in common.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.410
We've got this, right?

11:55.932 --> 11:56.933
Totally.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.419
[both groaning]

12:04.462 --> 12:06.203
Is now an okay time
to ask for a selfie?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.556
Stop. Stop. Stop.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.384
Jimmy, what are you thinking?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.604
What, are you gonna kill 'em
here, now?

12:15.647 --> 12:18.738
Gary's still cleaning up
from the last mess you made,
Clockwork Orange.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.305
Do 'em out in the alley.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.744
All right, come on. Let's go.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.920
Wait, wait! I knew
your brother. Dante!

12:27.659 --> 12:28.965
Stop. Hold up.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.445
[panting]

12:31.620 --> 12:32.708
How do you know Dante?

12:33.665 --> 12:35.580
It's a long story.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.409
If he were here,
he'd tell you
to listen to our proposal.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.497
[whispers]
What's our proposal?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.458
How'd you like to
get rid of Superman?

12:46.374 --> 12:50.247
All right, I've got
ledgers to keep and
miles to go before I sleep,

12:50.291 --> 12:51.988
so talk fast.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.078
Right. But first,
we need to know
if you can vibe.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.906
-Can I vibe?
-[Barry] Teleport.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.778
Open a breach.
You can still do that, right?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.475
Rhetorical question.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.129
How do you think
I got into all those
bank vaults?

13:04.696 --> 13:05.785
But you,

13:06.829 --> 13:08.309
you didn't know that.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.832
You came in here not knowing

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
if I could do
what you thought I could do.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.793
That's very risky.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
We're kind of desperate.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.274
Please keep giving me
more reasons to not do
business with you.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.928
All right, listen.
You could use your powers

13:18.972 --> 13:21.931
for so much more
than breaking into
bank vaults.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.934
Go back to the part
about taking down Super-dick.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.370
That's the part I wanna hear.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.459
We're gonna get to that.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.984
For now, I could teach you
how to use your powers

13:31.027 --> 13:32.550
to get to
a whole different Earth.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.162
A whole different Earth.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.689
Tell me more.

13:40.732 --> 13:41.821
[Killer Frost] Danvers.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.345
The big guy is out,

13:44.388 --> 13:46.869
-chasing down
a lead on the Twins.
-Ah.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.133
You know, Diggle can monitor
these sorry sacks
from upstairs.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.179
-Why don't you take
the night off?
-[Alex] It's okay.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.746
I still have some work to do.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.662
You know,
that's the third time
in just as many weeks

13:57.706 --> 14:01.188
I've told you to go home,
and you've turned me down.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.669
You know,
this sorry little pout's
really bringing me down.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.193
So, why don't you
want to go home?

14:06.236 --> 14:07.977
Boyfriend troubles?

14:08.021 --> 14:10.893
-[Alex] No.
No boyfriend presently.
-Boyfriend?

14:10.937 --> 14:14.157
Hmm. I thought you were
dating that dweeb in IT.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.419
Not impressed, by the way.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.334
Okay, it was
a couple of dates.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.989
And now he's dating Pam in HR.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.863
Ooh. Boy's got a type.
Also not impressed.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.734
You need to leave this place.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.170
You've got to get a life.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.172
Look, I love what I do.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.913
The work is important.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.872
[Killer Frost] Well, now you
sound like the big guy.

14:32.915 --> 14:36.179
And you and I both know
I don't mean that
as a compliment.

14:36.223 --> 14:39.182
Look, I'm sure the work
we do for the city is great,

14:39.226 --> 14:43.012
but half of what we do
around here is really
just to prop his ego up.

14:43.056 --> 14:46.233
[scoffs] Truth, justice,
and the American way?

14:46.276 --> 14:48.365
More like me, myself, and I.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.367
Hmm, yeah.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.283
All work and no play
doesn't just make a girl dull.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.546
It turns your heart to ice.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.766
And trust me, that ain't fun.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.422
I appreciate the offer,

15:01.465 --> 15:03.250
but I'm gonna stay
just the same.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.905
Suit yourself.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.570
-Oh, thank God we're here.
-Yeah.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.398
-Only took 17 tries.
-Yeah.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.965
Oh, I see. You're a comedian.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.575
Hey, guess what.
Your friend is a comedian.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.576
Still Barry?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.448
-Oh, no. We--
-No. Yeah.

15:27.491 --> 15:28.840
Oh. So it's fixed.
That's great.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.451
Eh...

15:32.279 --> 15:33.280
Oh, no.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.979
Kara?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.416
Mr. Ramon. Am I supposed to
believe this guy is Superman?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.984
What, did you get him
off the street?
You don't even look like him.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.681
Hey, uh, what's this?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.557
Yeah, you, uh... You really
shouldn't touch that.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.124
Hey, you could throw
a party with this thing.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.300
Get some party favors.
You know, I know a guy.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.128
Look, everything
is back to normal.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.346
Well, not everything.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.349
Where's Kara?

15:59.393 --> 16:00.568
[blowing]

16:04.354 --> 16:06.443
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[groaning]

16:07.705 --> 16:10.012
Alex, please. Stop!

16:10.056 --> 16:11.318
He warned you.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.147
I promise
I won't try to escape again.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.365
[speaking Japanese]

16:17.977 --> 16:20.022
[groaning]

16:20.066 --> 16:21.023
How do you know that?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.504
[panting]

16:23.547 --> 16:25.201
Alex Danvers taught it to me.

16:30.946 --> 16:34.036
I told you,
I'm not from this Earth.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.040
The Alex on my Earth
spent a summer in Nagano

16:38.084 --> 16:40.260
with Jeremiah and Eliza
when she was six.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.349
She was homesick.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.264
And a girl from the village

16:44.307 --> 16:47.702
helped her sneak down to
one of the temples one night.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.878
She wrote a note,
and she put it
in a crack in the wall,

16:49.921 --> 16:51.227
hoping it would come true.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.057
I was seven, not six.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.802
And that little girl
in the village,
she taught me that rhyme.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.674
-It means...
-[both] "Pinky swear."

17:06.112 --> 17:07.983
And my Alex taught it to me

17:08.027 --> 17:10.812
the first night we snuck out
together to go flying.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.297
My Alex was always
drawn to service.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.386
So it's not surprising

17:19.429 --> 17:22.563
that you care deeply,
so deeply,

17:22.606 --> 17:24.956
about this world
and all the people in it.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.569
But on my Earth?

17:28.612 --> 17:31.311
Alex doesn't just have a job.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.791
She's in charge
of a place like this.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.186
She's in charge?

17:39.971 --> 17:43.932
She's a leader
who is just and proud.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.109
When someone tells her
to do something
she knows is wrong,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.458
she gives them hell.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.808
And she does what's right.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.465
She doesn't
have powers like I do,

17:56.553 --> 17:58.947
but she's a hero.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.123
And she has the biggest heart
of anyone I know,

18:01.167 --> 18:03.212
even though she doesn't
always like to show it.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.434
And she has good friends.

18:07.477 --> 18:11.002
A real family of support
that she's created
for herself.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.660
And she doesn't hide
who she is.

18:19.663 --> 18:20.664
She wants a wife.

18:22.318 --> 18:23.537
And kids.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.584
She's optimistic
that she could have it all.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.936
It's not an "if."
It's a "when."

18:34.678 --> 18:37.812
-She sounds pretty awesome.
-She is.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.075
And I know I'm not your sister
on this planet.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.947
I guess my pod
didn't land here, but...

18:46.037 --> 18:47.343
You're still that person.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.346
I can tell.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.568
I know it.

18:54.611 --> 18:58.398
Superman rewrote
this reality to make us
all his prisoners.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.052
I think you're smart enough
to see through him.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.450
If I were to let you
out of that cell,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.932
you'd, what, stop him?

19:13.587 --> 19:14.675
Pinky swear.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.377
He's changed
all of Central City.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.944
Maybe even the whole world.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.207
Everybody thinks he's you,
and we're bad.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.557
I mean, I am bad.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.212
Bottom line,
Kara is nowhere to be found.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.779
[Barry] If we get
the book back,

19:31.822 --> 19:34.216
we should be able
to rewrite reality again.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.305
Yeah? And how
you gonna do that?

19:36.349 --> 19:39.439
You got a magic pen lying
around somewhere
behind these ice walls?

19:39.482 --> 19:41.615
It's not a pen.
It's just the mind.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.094
I've encountered
books like this before.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.922
The author writes things
into existence

19:44.966 --> 19:46.750
through sheer force of will.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.405
But changing the story
comes at a cost.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.581
Do you have any idea
where the book is?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.757
If I were him, I'd keep it
somewhere secure enough

19:53.801 --> 19:55.281
to also hold a Kryptonian.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.760
Easy. S.T.A.R. Labs.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.110
That place
is under lock and key.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.286
I did time there once.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.765
-Hey. So did we.
-We did.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.202
What did you do?

20:03.245 --> 20:05.116
Did I say you could touch me?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.770
Did I say he could touch me?

20:06.814 --> 20:08.598
I missed that part.

20:08.642 --> 20:09.817
-I have to go.
-You have to go.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.300
[gasps]

20:16.302 --> 20:18.129
Well, well, well.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.131
A traitor in our midst.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.524
You know, when I said
you should get out there

20:21.568 --> 20:23.134
and start dating, Danvers,

20:23.178 --> 20:24.832
this isn't quite
what I had in mind.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.791
I warned you.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.228
No, I tricked her
into opening my cell.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.360
-We don't know each other.
-Yes, we do.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.535
She's my sister.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.495
Aw.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.018
Well, then
you can burn together.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.326
Hi.

20:41.718 --> 20:42.763
Nice suit.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.726
Doctor, could I have
a word, please?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.513
Well, that's my cue.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.906
I'm out. You ladies have fun.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.606
[both grunting]

21:00.911 --> 21:02.739
-Go get the book.
-Yes!

21:05.525 --> 21:07.527
Alex, you're here.
What are you doing here?

21:07.570 --> 21:10.225
-[grunting]
-A badass
in every reality. Got it.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.488
No, no, no. It's okay.
He's not actually bad.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.533
-No?
-No, he's fine.

21:13.576 --> 21:14.751
-No--
-No, I'm good.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.057
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.276
-Badass. It's fine.
-Sorry.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.495
It's okay.
Where would Deegan, um...

21:19.539 --> 21:21.584
Superman keep
something valuable?

21:21.628 --> 21:23.238
Anything of importance to him,

21:23.282 --> 21:25.022
he keeps in a place called
the Fortress of Solitude.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.502
I'll take you there.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.244
I just came
from the Fortress of Solitude.

21:32.726 --> 21:33.727
[grunting]

21:39.646 --> 21:43.258
[pilot] Mayday! Mayday!
We've lost control. I can't
hold it. We're going down!

22:06.629 --> 22:07.630
[gasps]

22:10.633 --> 22:12.113
[groaning]

22:13.593 --> 22:14.768
Bizarro!

22:17.597 --> 22:19.555
How does it feel

22:19.599 --> 22:20.948
to be the villain for once?

22:27.868 --> 22:29.783
[pants]

22:29.826 --> 22:33.047
This isn't
a fortress of anything.
This is the time vault.

22:34.614 --> 22:35.615
It's unlocked.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.838
[Barry] All right, well,

22:41.882 --> 22:44.493
how does one
go about rewriting reality?

22:46.452 --> 22:47.409
Well...

22:50.586 --> 22:51.848
[grunting]

22:52.501 --> 22:54.808
[gasps]

22:54.851 --> 22:56.723
[Alex] You must still be weak
from The Pipeline.

22:56.766 --> 22:57.985
Are you okay?

22:58.028 --> 22:59.813
I don't know
how Deegan did it.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.380
Well, can I suggest
that whatever it is

23:01.423 --> 23:03.338
you need to find out,
we do far away from here?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.688
-[Barry] Clark knew
how to do it.
-I'll get this to him.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.399
[Kara] Superman.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.495
Clark, we need you
to open this.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.583
Fix things.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.419
He's doing it.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.464
Yeah.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.599
Hey.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.565
[groans]

24:39.608 --> 24:41.131
Make him close it,
or I snap his neck.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.176
No!

24:43.133 --> 24:44.831
Then your friend dies.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.923
-Not if I kill you first.
-Oliver, don't.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.185
Not to save me.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.578
You don't have to do this.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.840
You don't have to
channel your darkness.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.844
You can overcome it.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.802
You can be different.
You can be better.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.023
Maybe that's it.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.807
Maybe that's
the Monitor's test.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.162
[exclaims]

25:12.206 --> 25:13.642
[groaning]

25:26.742 --> 25:28.483
You really look just like him.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.703
I hope that's where
the resemblance ends.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.662
So he really rewrote the world
with that book?

25:33.706 --> 25:35.229
He rewrote my life?

25:35.272 --> 25:36.447
Yeah.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.667
It's funny.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.627
Because I feel like
this was always me.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.237
But I guess
everybody does, right?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.978
This is you.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.981
Someone who is willing
to stand up for what's right.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.331
I mean, after all of this
goes back to normal,

25:50.374 --> 25:52.115
that'll still be who you are.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.380
Your sister
is a very lucky woman.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.254
I'm a lucky sister.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.908
-[rumbling]
-[alarm blaring]

26:02.561 --> 26:04.345
Okay. Go.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.694
Save the world.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.618
What's happening?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.577
Deegan must be
rewriting reality again.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.882
Or destroying it.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.797
There might be a way
to slow him down.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.713
We literally
slow down time.

26:24.757 --> 26:27.498
Come on, that's got to be
like only the
fourth most crazy thing

26:27.542 --> 26:28.717
you've heard
in the past three hours.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.240
How do we
slow down time, Barry?

26:30.284 --> 26:32.460
If Supergirl and I
travel around the globe

26:32.503 --> 26:34.593
in opposite directions
at just over mach 7,

26:34.636 --> 26:36.638
we should be able to create
enough centrifugal force

26:36.682 --> 26:38.727
to slow the Earth's rotation.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.076
And everything else.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.469
Rip the book
out of Deegan's hands,

26:41.512 --> 26:43.645
and everything
goes back to normal.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.777
We can do this.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.649
You both die.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.655
When I opened the book,

26:53.699 --> 26:55.091
I watched both of you die,

26:55.135 --> 26:56.484
doing exactly
what you're talking about.

26:56.527 --> 26:57.920
[both screaming]

26:57.964 --> 26:59.095
If it's in the book--

26:59.139 --> 27:00.314
It's destiny.

27:01.402 --> 27:02.664
I believe Clark.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.970
We have to try something.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.321
-You ready?
-Yeah.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.323
Kara.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.457
Where are you going?

27:13.501 --> 27:17.113
I have an idea.
Just [sighs] get the book.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.245
And Barry and Kara?

27:19.855 --> 27:21.857
We need to hope
destinies can be rewritten.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.257
[people screaming]

27:52.540 --> 27:55.195
Novu!

27:55.238 --> 27:57.980
I know you're in there,
you son of a bitch!

27:58.024 --> 28:00.156
I'm not afraid of you.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.985
I'm not impressed by you!

28:03.029 --> 28:05.553
Stop with these games,
and show yourself!

28:11.037 --> 28:13.039
So much passion.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.258
And hubris.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.697
To think,

28:18.740 --> 28:22.701
that if you just yell loud
enough you can command a god.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.180
You're not a god.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.834
Yet, there isn't a name
for what I am,

28:25.878 --> 28:28.315
so I suppose
"god" will have to do.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.058
Your time is limited.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.714
I'm not sure what
little remains is best spent
making demands of me.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.890
I already told you
what you had to do.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.109
I know what happens
to Barry and Kara.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.024
Mmm.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.940
And now you're here
in the faint hope
I can alter it.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.029
Well, you just said
you were a god.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.729
Now, I don't think
you're testing us to see
if we're strong enough.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.688
I think you're testing us
to see if we are good enough.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.299
And I don't think,

28:56.343 --> 28:58.867
in any of the universes
you've tested,

28:58.911 --> 29:03.742
that anyone has ever stood
and confronted you like this.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.744
Yes.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.658
You are the first
in a multitude.

29:07.702 --> 29:10.313
I'm not who you need!

29:10.357 --> 29:13.186
You said I'd pass the test
if I knew my true self.

29:15.797 --> 29:19.148
My true self
is filled with darkness.

29:19.192 --> 29:22.761
But Barry and Kara
are different.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.633
They inspire hope.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.767
They inspire people
because they are
the best of us.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.769
And if this test of yours

29:30.812 --> 29:33.989
is gonna kill our best chance
at stopping this crisis,

29:38.994 --> 29:40.735
well, as gods go,

29:42.345 --> 29:45.131
you're not a very smart one.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.742
The universe is
a complex piece of machinery,

29:47.786 --> 29:50.005
and balance
must be maintained.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.095
One change requires another.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.839
How would you propose
I keep the balance?

30:04.715 --> 30:05.760
[grunts]

30:12.549 --> 30:13.942
[people screaming]

30:16.118 --> 30:17.119
[sirens blaring]

30:32.743 --> 30:34.615
You can't just
wear that symbol
on your chest

30:34.658 --> 30:36.269
and call yourself
a hero, Deegan.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.532
Our powers amplify who we are.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.535
And the way you've been
using yours

30:41.578 --> 30:43.232
tells me you don't have
the mettle for this.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.451
No. No, you're wrong.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.757
I didn't think big enough.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.020
[panting]

30:48.063 --> 30:49.673
I won't
make that mistake again.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.465
[screaming]

30:58.508 --> 30:59.727
[groaning]

30:59.770 --> 31:02.773
You see?
There is no defeating me!

31:02.817 --> 31:07.126
I am the master of this world!

31:08.867 --> 31:11.434
Blah, blah, blah.
That's a bit much,
don't you think?

31:11.478 --> 31:13.132
Honey?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.176
Yes, dear?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.179
An enormous robot

31:21.792 --> 31:24.317
with the powers
of Superman.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.841
This is exciting.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.843
Thank you for including me.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.945
I'll protect the civilians.
Finish this.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.259
-It's over, Deegan.
-[Deegan] No!

31:53.302 --> 31:55.304
I decide when the story ends!

31:55.348 --> 31:56.915
I liked you better in blue.

32:07.751 --> 32:08.752
[groaning]

32:15.020 --> 32:16.369
[yells]

32:21.417 --> 32:22.418
[grunting]

32:24.551 --> 32:25.552
[screaming]

32:26.422 --> 32:27.423
Lois.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.530
[yelling]

33:04.330 --> 33:05.548
[yelling]

33:05.592 --> 33:06.593
[yelling]

33:33.489 --> 33:35.970
-Told you you'd catch me.
-[chuckles]

33:38.146 --> 33:39.495
[grunting]

33:40.540 --> 33:41.889
[grunting]

33:43.282 --> 33:46.024
[screaming]

34:10.657 --> 34:12.006
Barry and Kara,

34:15.009 --> 34:16.358
you had more faith than I did.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.274
Well, I don't Kara
as well as I know Barry,

34:19.318 --> 34:21.233
but when things get tough,
he doesn't slow down.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.497
He digs deep and runs faster.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.021
That's my cousin to a T.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.024
[both panting]

34:32.505 --> 34:34.159
Then you know
why I had faith in them.

34:38.859 --> 34:42.210
Does the book
say anything about
what I should do with this?

34:42.254 --> 34:44.038
Amazo's motherboard.

34:46.606 --> 34:47.607
[chuckles]

34:55.180 --> 34:57.486
So this is kind of becoming
an annual thing, huh?

34:57.530 --> 34:59.140
-God, I hope not.
-[laughs]

34:59.184 --> 35:02.317
Is that a... [gasps]
Are you smiling?

35:02.361 --> 35:04.841
I kind of like you guys.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.843
-Don't tell anyone.
-[laughs]

35:06.887 --> 35:08.715
I hope to
see you all again soon.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.238
[Superman]
Preferably without giving Lois

35:10.282 --> 35:12.110
another reason
to dive headfirst into danger.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.763
-I dive where you dive, babe.
-Hmm.

35:13.807 --> 35:16.375
Cisco, would you
do the honors?

35:16.418 --> 35:18.333
Anything for
my favorite Kryptonian.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.248
That's right.
I have a favorite Kryptonian.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.295
Yes. A good choice.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.603
Well...

35:27.647 --> 35:28.735
[sighs]

35:28.778 --> 35:31.041
Until next time.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.566
Peace out
from your favorite Kryptonian.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.133
[laughs]

35:40.442 --> 35:43.141
Wow, you did so much work
while I was gone.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.055
This place looks amazing.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.188
Yeah, well, I wanted to
make sure it was all good
for Ma.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.233
Aw.

35:50.626 --> 35:53.977
So, uh, Brainy and J'onn
went back to National City?

35:54.021 --> 35:55.240
Duty calls.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.633
Well,

35:57.677 --> 35:59.635
I hope you realize

35:59.679 --> 36:03.073
that being a part of the DEO
or not being
a part of the DEO,

36:03.117 --> 36:06.207
you don't need an organization
to keep the world safe.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.209
And no matter the universe,

36:08.253 --> 36:11.386
you and Alex,
you'll find a way
to have each other's backs.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.215
Yeah, you're right.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.739
Like, you really are
so much
stronger than me, Kara.

36:16.783 --> 36:19.177
Every time we're together,
I see it.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.395
-Mmm...
-Which is why

36:20.439 --> 36:23.224
I know what I'm doing is okay.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.313
What are you doing, Clark?

36:25.357 --> 36:28.186
[Lois] You need to stop
beating around the bush.

36:28.229 --> 36:31.363
People like people
who are direct.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.017
What is going on?

36:34.061 --> 36:36.150
I told you
we had a lot of fun on Argo.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.326
-Lois. Lois--
-We're all adults.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.025
Are you having a baby?

36:43.375 --> 36:45.986
-[Clark chuckles]
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36:46.029 --> 36:47.640
Yes! [squeals]

36:47.683 --> 36:50.033
Congratulations!
This is so great!

36:50.077 --> 36:51.644
I'm so happy for you.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.995
And the safest place
for Lois to be is on Argo.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.388
When the baby
starts kicking...

36:56.431 --> 36:58.259
Oh, yeah, that would be awful.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.347
[laughs]

37:00.609 --> 37:02.350
So, you're gone
another nine months?

37:03.525 --> 37:04.570
Uh...

37:04.613 --> 37:06.354
A little longer than that.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.488
Look, this fight, it...

37:09.531 --> 37:13.579
It reminded me of everything
that I could lose.

37:13.622 --> 37:17.844
But the only reason
I feel safe
hanging up my cape for a while

37:17.887 --> 37:19.715
is because of you.

37:19.759 --> 37:23.328
The world
doesn't need Superman
if it has Supergirl.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.678
It's actually
probably a bit safer.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.114
-Oh.
-A study
out of Harvard last year

37:27.157 --> 37:28.550
said that women respond better
than men

37:28.594 --> 37:29.943
-under competitive pressure.
-[Kara] Huh.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.032
We are better in a crisis.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.861
More apt to ask questions
before punching.

37:34.904 --> 37:37.690
-Hmm.
-Not that
you are not totally terrific.

37:37.733 --> 37:38.734
Uh-huh.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.606
Bottom line,

37:41.737 --> 37:43.957
the world is safe with you.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.568
Aw. I'm gonna miss you guys.

37:53.096 --> 37:56.883
Honestly, the world might be
fine with just Kara Danvers.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.885
Your cousin ain't half bad.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.365
Clark. Clark.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.888
-What?
-What... It's burning.

38:01.931 --> 38:03.455
Oh! Oh, no. No.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.891
-[sizzling]
-[Lois coughing]

38:04.934 --> 38:06.632
Next time,
use your heat vision.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.590
-Oh, you're right.
-[coughing]

38:08.634 --> 38:10.549
I'm sorry.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.594
I just wanted tonight
to be special.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.248
Why?

38:14.292 --> 38:15.989
Because I want every night
to be special.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.079
I mean, with you.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.124
But also special...

38:21.168 --> 38:23.562
-[laughs]
-...forever.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.913
With you...
I'm so bad at this.

38:26.956 --> 38:29.655
What did I tell you in Kansas?
Be direct.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.439
[chuckles]

38:36.792 --> 38:38.316
[sizzling]

38:39.142 --> 38:40.143
[crushing]

38:58.988 --> 39:00.207
Lois Lane...

39:03.079 --> 39:04.777
-That's all I had to say?
-Yeah.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.344
I like this direct thing.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.258
[both laughing]

39:11.653 --> 39:13.960
-[rock music playing]
-Hmm.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.441
It's nice to be able to feel
the effects of alcohol again.

39:16.484 --> 39:20.967
Yeah. Super speed
has its pluses
and its minuses.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.447
[Oliver]
Always hungry.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.797
I was burning holes
in my shoes.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.494
You're not gonna miss anything
about it?

39:27.365 --> 39:29.323
There were a few times

39:29.367 --> 39:31.847
where I was running so fast,

39:31.891 --> 39:33.849
it was like

39:33.893 --> 39:36.635
things were standing still...

39:36.678 --> 39:38.898
Everything just felt really
clear to me.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.640
I'm gonna miss that.

39:41.683 --> 39:43.642
-Flashtime.
-What?

39:43.685 --> 39:45.252
That's just what I call it.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.036
You really have a name
for everything.

39:49.038 --> 39:52.390
So I feel like I should be
thanking you for something.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.089
The Monitor.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.483
-You talked to him,
didn't you?
-Mmm-hmm.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.181
You got him to change
our destinies somehow.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.401
You and Kara
changed your destinies, Barry,

40:03.444 --> 40:06.578
by being the heroes
that you always have been.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.887
Hey, I've been you.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.585
I lived it. I felt it.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.892
You're a good man.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.547
[sighs] So are you.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.636
Even if you don't want
people to believe it.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.291
I'm not as good
as you think I am.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.858
But because of you,

40:27.816 --> 40:29.339
I think
I'll get there someday.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.737
-Should we hug it out?
-No. No.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.435
And I really mean it
this time.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.828
Twice, you've made me hug you.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.482
-No.
-All right.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.049
Okay? I mean it.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.878
I will propose a toast.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.143
To appreciating what you have,

40:52.711 --> 40:54.452
however long
you might have it.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.326
[cell phone vibrating]

41:02.982 --> 41:04.070
Excuse me.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.292
I thought
you were done with us.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.816
[Batwoman] Wishful thinking.

41:12.818 --> 41:15.124
I just came from Arkham.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.822
Tell me
this deranged doctor of yours

41:16.865 --> 41:18.606
isn't going to be
a bigger problem.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.129
Deegan? Why?

41:20.173 --> 41:22.480
Because I hear
he's made a friend.

41:25.047 --> 41:27.485
[inmates clamoring]

41:27.528 --> 41:30.183
[man] Don't worry, Doctor.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.185
Everything is
as it should be.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.362
The stage is set.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.017
Worlds will live.

41:39.235 --> 41:41.760
Worlds will die.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.024
And the universe

41:46.025 --> 41:47.722
will never be the same.
