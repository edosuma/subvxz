13:05.201 --> 13:06.577
I-I don't know if I'm
ready for the F-word.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.953
Didn't we just do the...

13:07.995 --> 13:09.705
"Future," Dev.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.915
All right,
we don't have to talk about

13:10.956 --> 13:12.374
Kaela and Dev's future.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.668
But you know
who we could talk about?
Hmm?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.504
Jaela and Lev.
(laughs)

13:16.545 --> 13:18.756
I'm hearing
Jaela and Lev are getting into

13:18.798 --> 13:20.716
all sorts of trouble next month.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.134
(chuckling)

13:22.176 --> 13:23.469
Mm.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.096
Okay.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.391
For now, can we just
be present and...

13:29.433 --> 13:31.602
lay in this moment of heaven?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.978
Yeah.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.233
MAGGIE:
Mel. Hey.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.151
What are you doing
with the Unity Bowl?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.403
It seems like it doesn't
want to stay destroyed.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.531
It keeps reassembling itself.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.865
I'm gonna put it
in the Tomb of Chaos,

13:44.907 --> 13:46.033
so no one else can get at it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.243
Good idea.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.661
I'll come with.
Oh, hey, Jordan.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.204
Hey, Mel.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.207
(clicks tongue,
chuckles)

13:55.584 --> 13:57.628
Oh, so you have sex hair,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.839
and is your hoodie
actually inside out?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.131
Don't judge me.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.591
No judgement here.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.927
I may have had a similar
walk of shame tonight.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.846
Roxie?

14:06.887 --> 14:09.265
Oh, my God, I knew it.
Don't. It's nothing.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.851
Oh. Well, is that
how you want it to stay?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.270
Nothing?
I don't think so.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.771
I don't know.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.606
Aw, Mel.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.201
What the hell?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.873
How did they get in here?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.721
(gasps)
My powers are gone.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.180
Mine, too.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.058
Give us the bowl,
and nobody needs to get hurt.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.935
Yeah, or don't.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.813
We're happy to just, uh,
take it.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.648
Run.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.151
We'll get back to the house.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.777
It's still protected.

15:04.695 --> 15:08.407
(grunts, groans)

15:10.910 --> 15:12.995
It's a containment spell.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.955
They're not chasing us

15:14.997 --> 15:16.665
because they don't have to.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.750
We're sitting ducks.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.627
With no powers to fight back.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.472
Fan out. Find them.

They got to be somewhere.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.980
No service.
MAN: Come out, wherever you are.

One of Sunny's people must be

15:41.482 --> 15:43.275
blocking the signal
or something.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.985
Great, that
and Frosty the Snowbitch

15:45.027 --> 15:46.362
knocking out our powers.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.696
If we had Blue Camellia matches,

15:47.738 --> 15:49.073
we could smoke out of here.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.033
Jordan might have some
up in the gym.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.244
But if we can't get out,
we're gonna need backup.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.373
Ruby has a landline
in her office.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.416
If I can get in there,
I can call Kaela.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.627
Whatever happens,

16:01.669 --> 16:03.545
we have to
keep the Unity Bowl safe.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.839
Each take half

I can do this quietly.

Got to stop meeting like this.

(sizzling)

17:07.818 --> 17:10.529
I hear next weekend,
Jaela is taking Lev

17:10.571 --> 17:12.573
to see some of her street art
in Philly.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.700
She might even
buy him a cheesesteak.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.951
You wouldn't know what to do

17:15.993 --> 17:17.494
with a cheesesteak.
I'm sorry,

17:17.536 --> 17:19.663
Lev wouldn't know
what to do with a cheesesteak.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.915
(laughs)

17:21.957 --> 17:23.167
Kind of I feel bad for Lev.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.252
Feel like he
didn't realize

17:25.294 --> 17:27.671
how crazy it would be
to date a Charmed One.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.590
I don't know, maybe it gives
his otherwise carefree life

17:29.631 --> 17:30.966
a little bit more meaning.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.969
I haven't had that
since my temple days.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.429
Uh, Lev

17:35.471 --> 17:36.847
hasn't.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.348
Hmm.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.977
(chimes, vibrates)

17:43.854 --> 17:46.648
Missed call from Ruby Malone
for Seattle City Council?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.859
I'm pretty sure
that's Mel's ex.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.861
Why is she calling me?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.072
MEL:
Hey, Kaela. It's Mel.

I don't understand.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.634
Infinite Home Video?

18:14.426 --> 18:17.179
Think it's an inside joke,
but, honestly,

18:17.221 --> 18:18.764
I'm not even sure.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.183
Well, how could you not know?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.435
Because I was sent here

18:23.477 --> 18:24.978
15 years ago.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.940
I can move through
liminal spaces

18:27.981 --> 18:29.691
like this in the Veil,

18:29.733 --> 18:31.401
but I can't get back
to the real world.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.572
That's why
I came looking for you.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.619
"I gave my word.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.704
My word is my vow."

18:45.374 --> 18:46.708
You're...

18:46.750 --> 18:48.919
A Whitelighter. Was.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.004
Like you.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.506
And I need your help.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.424
If you were a Whitelighter,
I'd know you.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.178
And how did you survive
the death of the Elders?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.764
(scoffs)

19:00.806 --> 19:02.224
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.269
And how'd you know about me?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.104
The tapes.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.815
The tapes?

19:09.857 --> 19:12.985
All of this world's history.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.660
Okay. Look.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.580
I don't know what this place
or you really are,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.206
but I need to get back
to the Veil.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.169
There's a muse I was
sent to contact.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.921
Listen to me.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.924
That scarf led
you to a banshee.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.177
The blood on it
wasn't from a muse.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.553
It looks like
someone set you up.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.638
Which is what
I need to figure out.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.849
Please! You can't just leave!

19:44.600 --> 19:46.310
(gasps)

20:11.293 --> 20:13.378
(clattering)

20:26.058 --> 20:27.226
Everything all right?

20:27.267 --> 20:28.852
I don't know.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.104
Duncan said Camellia was
wearing this when she died.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.773
DIANA:
That scarf led you to a banshee.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.316
It looks like
someone set you up.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.404
You gave Camellia's scarf
to Roxie.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.115
You knew I wouldn't find her
using this blood.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.534
You have to tell me, Duncan.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.495
What did you do?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.164
Kill Roxie's wife?
(panting)

20:53.085 --> 20:55.337
It was...

20:55.379 --> 20:57.422
it was so much worse than that.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.890
It's not working.

21:08.183 --> 21:11.019
I don't think
it's technically an injury.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.984
Uh, we should get back to Mel.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.987
Yeah. Right.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.446
Hey, about what happened
earlier...

21:21.488 --> 21:23.490
For the record,
I wasn't planning...

21:23.532 --> 21:24.950
Me either.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.451
I mean, not that it...

21:26.493 --> 21:28.120
it wasn't, like...

21:29.788 --> 21:31.581
It was a mistake. (chuckles)

21:31.623 --> 21:33.166
Won't happen again.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.334
(elevator rumbles)

21:35.877 --> 21:37.671
We're moving.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.010
(elevator dings)

21:43.969 --> 21:45.929
Who are you?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.181
(scoffs) Better question.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.726
Where is she?
(thud)

21:50.767 --> 21:52.311
(grunting)

21:52.352 --> 21:53.854
Go, go.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.407
Finally, I get to make you pay.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.452
After your little
GemCast post...

22:08.493 --> 22:10.412
And what about your posts?

22:10.454 --> 22:11.705
You doxxed us.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.415
You put people
we love in danger.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.750
Everything you post
is out of context.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.001
Never showing
how much they help,

22:16.043 --> 22:17.586
how much we all care.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.338
You want context?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.590
She is the reason
my brother died.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.511
He was murdered
due to your negligence.

22:26.553 --> 22:29.639
I'm so sorry your brother
was taken from you.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.352
I've lost loved ones, too.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.271
And I know how violence
and anger can seem

22:36.313 --> 22:37.564
like the only way forward.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.111
I know how
it can feel.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.780
Like nothing
can ever...

22:44.821 --> 22:46.782
Door through
a containment spell, check.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.700
You think you can
draw one into a bank vault?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.160
Just curious.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.411
Shh, shh.
What?

22:51.453 --> 22:54.831
When I lost him...

22:54.873 --> 22:56.917
I never felt so alone.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.171
But the Unseen

23:01.213 --> 23:04.591
have shown me there
is another way.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.511
The Lost One will free us all.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.554
KAELA:
Maggie!

23:12.057 --> 23:13.725
(both grunt)

23:16.686 --> 23:17.646
(gasps)

23:17.687 --> 23:19.189
Where'd you get a hammer?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.357
I had, like, five seconds
to find a weapon.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.525
You said hurry.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.984
(chuckles softly)

23:23.026 --> 23:24.361
Seems like we missed a lot.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.990
You don't have to do this.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.283
Grab her.
Wait just a second.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.828
I heard what you said

23:32.869 --> 23:34.746
when we were trapped
inside that church.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.624
I understand
why you haven't felt included

23:37.666 --> 23:39.709
or protected.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.838
I haven't been the best leader
in our community.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.340
But I want to be better.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.884
We need more than you
wanting to be better.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.428
We need action.

23:49.469 --> 23:50.720
We need representation.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.223
I hear you.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.683
I really do.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.811
Look, we can call off this raid

23:57.853 --> 23:58.979
if your sisters
and you just...

24:00.105 --> 24:02.023
(gasps)
(choking)

24:04.985 --> 24:06.695
Time for compromise is over.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.740
Sometimes you just
got to burn it all down.

24:15.745 --> 24:16.997
Your neck.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.748
You got hit by a blocker.
KAELA: A what?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.125
DEV:
Bright blue hair.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.002
Frosty personality. No?

24:22.043 --> 24:24.171
They can temporarily cut off
your powers through meditation.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.715
How do we undo its effects?

24:26.756 --> 24:28.008
We take out the blocker.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.887
(phone vibrates)

24:32.929 --> 24:34.264
It's Mel.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.932
She must have got
the phones working again.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.517
Hey, M...

24:37.559 --> 24:39.060
Not Mel.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.979
But if you want her
to survive the night,

24:41.021 --> 24:42.439
you'll bring me
the other half of the bowl.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.191
And I know Kaela's with you,

24:44.232 --> 24:45.817
so don't try anything dodgy.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.152
(alert beeping steadily)

24:47.194 --> 24:49.029
This little witch tracker is

24:49.070 --> 24:50.989
quite handy.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.826
Oh, and...

24:56.453 --> 24:58.955
If I were you, I'd hurry.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.299
We need to get your powers back.
And fast.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.842
Mel looked like
she needed healing.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.052
Sunny's probably got
the blocker tucked away

25:12.093 --> 25:13.053
someplace safe.

25:13.094 --> 25:14.804
Meditating.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.306
She'll be open
for an attack.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.141
There's no time.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.310
We have to at least act
like we're gonna make the trade.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.020
Look, Sunny doesn't
know I'm here.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.396
I'll take out the blocker.

25:23.438 --> 25:24.898
Wait, what?

25:26.691 --> 25:28.235
I'll be careful.
Don't worry.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.117
Just take care
of yourself, okay?

25:36.159 --> 25:38.286
And...

25:38.328 --> 25:40.622
I'll be at that gig in Iceland.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.457
(chuckles)
You or Jaela?

25:42.499 --> 25:45.126
Me. Me and you.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.838
DUNCAN:
It wasn't always
this epic romance.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.968
The way Roxie saw things was...

25:53.009 --> 25:56.555
was not how
Camellia experienced it.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.393
I was an orphan,

26:01.434 --> 26:03.853
and they took me in.

26:04.479 --> 26:07.816
I helped Camellia with the bar
when Roxie slept.

26:09.150 --> 26:13.321
Camellia loved Roxie deeply,

26:13.363 --> 26:14.698
but...

26:17.951 --> 26:21.079
...seven years without her,

26:21.121 --> 26:23.373
alone...

26:24.040 --> 26:26.835
...the bar became like a prison.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.050
The night she died, Duncan.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.469
What happened that night?

26:37.512 --> 26:40.140
DUNCAN:
There was a fight.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.768
Some demons came
after a banshee.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.270
It got ugly.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.568
It all became too much.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.945
The-the politics,

26:53.987 --> 26:57.532
the-the dangers of running
the Blue Camellia alone,

26:57.574 --> 26:59.701
and...

26:59.743 --> 27:02.287
the pressure, the...

27:03.496 --> 27:05.373
...the loneliness.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.760
Loving Roxie just got too hard.

27:17.761 --> 27:18.845
No, Camellia.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.306
No!

27:23.141 --> 27:25.393
No.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.520
Uh, she just took off.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.564
Camellia is alive?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.861
I don't know.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.739
I haven't spoken to her
since she left.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.950
Harry, you have to
understand.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.037
Their relationship was over.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.373
There was no changing that.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.250
You thought
if Roxie knew what happened,

27:49.292 --> 27:50.877
she'd close the bar.

27:51.836 --> 27:55.882
And it's the only home
most of these creatures have,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.593
the only place they feel safe.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.684
The only place you feel safe.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.774
You can't tell her, Harry.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.319
It will break her.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.115
And she is all I have left.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.786
MAGGIE:
We're here.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.080
We got the other half
of the bowl.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.921
Mel.
Stay back.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.840
No, first the rest of the bowl.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.470
Hand it over.
Not until you untie her.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.515
Mel, you okay?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.393
Nobody's untying anyone.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.769
Hey, where is Sunny?

28:57.861 --> 29:00.572
Dev.
(sighs)

29:00.613 --> 29:03.408
I knew they'd try something,
but I didn't expect you.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.659
You don't belong
with them.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.119
You're one of us.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.705
I know you, Dev.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.832
You don't put your neck out
for lost causes.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
So, here,

29:14.043 --> 29:16.045
free ticket out of this mess.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.549
This ain't your fight, mate.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.009
Smoke out of here.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.261
Live to sing another day.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.983
You're wrong.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.610
This is my fight.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.490
(grunts)

29:44.449 --> 29:45.617
Maggie, your neck.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.785
Mel, our powers.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.958
MEL:
Just hand over the
other half of the bowl,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.795
and we'll let you all
walk away, no trouble.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.798
And what if we came here
looking for trouble?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.884
(Dev screaming)

30:02.926 --> 30:04.803
Dev?

30:12.769 --> 30:14.562
(knocking)

30:23.154 --> 30:25.782
I have something to tell you.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.868
You don't have to.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.371
I hear everything
that goes on in my bar.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.670
What are you gonna do now?

30:38.711 --> 30:41.089
About Camellia?

30:42.674 --> 30:43.925
Grieve.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.635
And Duncan?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.024
(scoffs)

31:02.026 --> 31:03.862
He's all I have, too.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.953
I know this is not what
you envisaged by closure.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.622
Trust me.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.374
I've lived with that pain.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.044
Could you get out of my office?

31:28.511 --> 31:30.013
(door opens)

31:31.347 --> 31:33.474
(door closes)

31:33.516 --> 31:34.475
(door opens)

31:34.517 --> 31:36.853
(door closes)

31:36.895 --> 31:38.438
Dev.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.149
Hey, Dev!

31:41.190 --> 31:43.234
Dev, please. No.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.237
SUNNY:
Looks like you're a real
Charmed One after all.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.991
Sacrificing others
to maintain your power.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.626
You did this.

31:59.667 --> 32:00.668
You killed him.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.961
Not me.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.296
Mm...

32:03.338 --> 32:04.756
Sorry.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.759
And now I'm gonna kill you,

32:07.800 --> 32:11.137
because I've got
four lives to your one.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.847
I don't like your odds.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.974
MAGGIE:
Just give us the damn bowl!

32:15.016 --> 32:16.726
(grunting)

32:23.399 --> 32:25.526
(screaming)

32:38.373 --> 32:39.624
Jordan, look out!

32:40.583 --> 32:42.460
(grunting)

32:49.258 --> 32:50.885
Any last words?

32:50.927 --> 32:53.012
You're gonna wish
you didn't do that.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.119
MEL:
We got to find Kaela.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.623
SUNNY:
Are we doing this or not?

33:22.834 --> 33:25.044
Guess the bitch really does
have nine lives.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.130
Hands off.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.798
Okay.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.258
Sensitive about the arm.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.679
(Kaela gasps)

33:35.680 --> 33:38.141
You've only got
four lives left.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.855
(groans)

33:43.896 --> 33:45.982
(panting)

33:50.987 --> 33:52.739
What are you...

33:54.699 --> 33:56.993
(cries out)

33:59.537 --> 34:01.080
(screams)

34:01.122 --> 34:03.249
(wheezing)

34:06.294 --> 34:08.296
How many lives you got now?

34:08.337 --> 34:09.881
Hmm?

34:11.799 --> 34:13.134
Don't you dare.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.804
Aah!

34:20.433 --> 34:21.976
(gasps)

34:32.278 --> 34:34.238
(door opens)

34:35.531 --> 34:37.658
Kaela.
Kaela.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.535
(door closes)

34:39.577 --> 34:40.745
KAELA:
Oh,

34:40.787 --> 34:42.330
Dev.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.848
Let's get you home.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.893
We can stay with you.

Whatever you need.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.981
No.
