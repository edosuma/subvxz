00:20.395 --> 00:24.816


00:29.529 --> 00:32.365
What up, Julian?
You get that address for me?

00:32.449 --> 00:33.283
Yeah.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.703
Listen, Kid, why you trying
to find old girl from the VIP room?

00:36.786 --> 00:39.205
<i>We were supposed to meet up,</i>
<i>but Carlton, he actin' funny</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:40.790
'cause she chose me over him.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.877
I lost her number.
I just wanna pop up on her.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.420
All right. I got you.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.173
Listen, just don't give me
no trouble, bro, all right?

01:24.292 --> 01:25.293
Daphne.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.014
-I know it's you.
-Sorry. I think you have the wrong person.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.641
Come on, cut the shit, Daphne.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.018
Or Simone,
or whatever your fucking name is.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.857
I'm so sorry. I didn't even wanna do it.
He told me we could make a little money.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.192
-Who's he?
-Couple hundred grand.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.152
-Who said?
-All I had to do was get you drunk

01:51.236 --> 01:52.237
and pretend to be dead.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.531
-Whose idea was it?
-I didn't know what was gonna happen.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.200
Do you hear what I'm asking?
Whose fucking idea was it?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.368
Was it Ari?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.328
Was it Ari?

02:01.788 --> 02:04.124
Answer my fucking question.
Was it Ari's idea?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.709
It was Carlton's.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.588
It was his idea. It was him.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.966
He brought Ari in.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.143
I'm so sorry!

02:26.604 --> 02:33.319


02:44.956 --> 02:47.584
Yo, meet me at the hotel.
I got a surprise for you.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.918
<i>A surprise?</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:51.671
Nah, man. My head is spinning.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.924
Trust me, it'll be a good one.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.841
Carlton. It's Todd. You in there?

04:21.594 --> 04:23.304
-Hey.
-What you want?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
I thought we could have a little talk.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.610
I brought coffee and I brought donuts.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.240
I thought you went to fat camp
for eating that shit.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.326
Man, I told Kid that stuff in confidence.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.413
Look at that.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.334
Okay, I'll get to it.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.502
Um…

04:54.585 --> 04:57.422
Kid texted me that you're thinking
of coming to New York with us.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.301
Yeah. Yeah. We actually
talked about me going to LA too.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.595
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.972
Okay.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.851
Can you tell me
what's going on with him and you two?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.063
Come on, man.
Philly's been fucked since jump.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.650
A couple years ago, I'd figure
he was using again, but it's not that.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.320
What is it?

05:25.783 --> 05:26.784
Really?

05:29.829 --> 05:30.830
Carlton.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.375
I'm not the guy who finds out where
the bodies are buried when it's too late.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.711
I'm the guy who tells you where to dig.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.217
The sooner you can accept that,
the easier all our lives are gonna get.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.977
Okay, fine.

05:53.561 --> 05:58.733
Well, welcome back to your brother's life,
where you continue to get a free ride.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.569
Enjoy the donuts.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.488
See you later.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.990
I should have laid your ass out
for saying that shit.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.158
Come on, man.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.118
Let me tell you something.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.955
I don't wanna be
in your little "circle" bullshit.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.332
I got my own shit.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.376
I got a restaurant.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.712
Which, just like everything else
in your life, your brother gave you.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.674
Yeah, hold on one second.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.302
You know, this Gene shit,
it's a national story now,

06:26.386 --> 06:29.097
so I gotta go
because I have to protect your brother,

06:29.847 --> 06:31.182
because that's my job.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.018
You have a good day.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.728
Yeah, go ahead.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.772
-Fucker.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.576
<i>He's now "Behind the Scenes Gene",</i>
<i>do you hear me?</i>

06:51.661 --> 06:53.287
<i> Here we go, see this right now?</i>

06:53.371 --> 06:55.123
<i>We're live. Right? Huh?</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:56.666
<i>-Come on, Gene.</i>
Motherfucker!

06:56.749 --> 06:59.460
-Savvas! Come on!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.295
Hey, man, don't squeeze too hard.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.674
-Look.
-What?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.176
<i>All right, huh?</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:08.928
That pussy threw you.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.473
-Did that <i>kariólis </i>lie to us?
-Find him!

07:15.017 --> 07:18.521
Mom, we got a problem.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.864
Man. What the fuck, man?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.032
You can't keep ducking off,
especially after Gene.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.410
I pay you to protect me, not lecture me.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.871
When I ask you to back off,
that's what the fuck you do,

07:34.954 --> 07:36.497
you back the fuck off!

07:36.581 --> 07:37.707
That's what you do.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.001
And I don't pay you to fuck Billie!

07:40.084 --> 07:41.586
That's not why I pay you.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.963
Get the fuck out my way, man.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.467
-Fuck!

07:47.550 --> 07:48.843
Fuck you!

07:48.926 --> 07:50.928
Keep putting your hand in my face neither.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.763
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
Everyone keep fucking with me, man.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.771
Everybody just wanna
keep fucking playing with me, huh?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.443
Keep playing with me.
Keep fucking taking shit from me.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.865
…fuck about nothing!

08:10.948 --> 08:13.409
Fuck all y'all! Fuck this room!

08:21.959 --> 08:23.336
Fuck this shit.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.754
Fucking with me, man.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.255
Fuck!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
Fuck! Fuck!

08:28.132 --> 08:29.342
Fuck!

08:49.987 --> 08:51.030
Yeah, what up?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.824
<i>Hey, man. Uh, the Sixers called.</i>

08:53.908 --> 08:56.327
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>you wanted to still go to the game…</i>

09:00.498 --> 09:01.832
Me and Carlton are going.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.920
-Get us a box, though. No floor seats.
<i>-Okay. I'm on it.</i>

09:23.312 --> 09:24.313
Carlton.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.858
Carlton!

09:31.279 --> 09:33.364
Got me on some bullshit.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.786
Still some glass there on the floor.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.086
I wanna check
with Meredith in Housekeeping.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.713
I think she's got another one.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.437
Damn.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.946
Hey, yo.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.909
What the fuck happened?

10:21.245 --> 10:24.248
Found out some bad shit happened,
and, um, I snapped.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.376
Uh, it wasn't Monyca or Chris, was it?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.338
No, it was some
bad business decisions I made,

10:30.421 --> 10:32.840
and it just got the best of me.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.135
I'ma tell Hersch we're coming down.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.347
All right. Where we going?

10:40.931 --> 10:41.807
The Sixers game.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.976
-Sixers?
-Mm-hmm.

10:44.060 --> 10:44.894
Okay.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.689
You do know that I love you, right?

10:48.773 --> 10:49.774
Yeah.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.985
Even when we fight, I know it.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.530
Cool.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.271
Welcome, Kid.
Here are your all-access passes.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.441
We're heading in at half time,
but it's gonna be a great second half.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.360
-I'll show you to your box.
-Thank you.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.028
All-access!

11:37.238 --> 11:41.158
Man, yeah. I haven't been to a Sixers game
since the last time you was here.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.496
Now we're gonna see
Bron-Bron get it on. Bron-Bron!

11:48.499 --> 11:52.169
I'm glad we had that talk last night.
I think we really turned a corner.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.380
We did.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.549
-We damn sure did.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.236
We love you, man.

12:40.009 --> 12:44.722
<i>Sixers fans, make some noise!</i>

12:44.805 --> 12:46.640
Okay. Okay.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.311
Nice. Nice. Oh, yeah.

12:53.731 --> 12:58.027
<i> Joel Embiid for two!</i>

13:00.488 --> 13:03.365
Hey, you remember that time
we snuck into the Spectrum

13:03.449 --> 13:05.701
to watch Barkley smash the Hawks?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.789
You was scared
that we was gonna get caught,

13:09.872 --> 13:13.042
but I got us in and out, no problem.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.671
Yeah, it was all right.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.092
What you got over here, man?

13:22.593 --> 13:25.095
-What it look like?
-A little bit of everything.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.391
<i>…comedy star, TV star, movie star,</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:39.652
<i>And I'm proud</i>
<i>to call him a friend.</i>

13:40.361 --> 13:42.947
<i>-Let's give a warm welcome for--</i>

13:57.253 --> 13:58.379
Where's Carlton?

14:00.673 --> 14:01.882
Cat got your tongue?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.761
Oh, that's right,
you're Carlton's girlfriend.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.471
Good.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.312
I haven't even seen Carlton.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.399
Please.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.192
Oh, fuck.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.487
I haven't even seen Carlton, I swear.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.697
<i>…as the bear…</i>

14:24.780 --> 14:27.116
-I came here looking for him.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.494
I called him, but I haven't seen him.
Fuck. Please don't hurt me.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.997
It's okay. It's okay.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.416
No!

14:44.800 --> 14:47.177
Hey, Hersch,
let me holla at C for a minute.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.618
Mm.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.831
You're kind of quiet. What's up?
Still tripping on that bad business?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.877
No.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.088
That's not it.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.846
It's because
I ran into your friend Simone.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.855
Or is it Daphne?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.110
Simone or Daphne, I don't know.
Which one do you prefer?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.989
It don't fucking matter.
You don't even gotta answer that.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.160
It was crazy for me, of course,
because I thought she was dead.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.663
She's not dead. She's alive.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.915
Blew my mind, man.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.381
-Look, I can explain.
-Explain?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.298
Yeah.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.133
What do you mean, you can explain?

16:08.884 --> 16:12.012
What explanation can you possibly give me
to make this make sense?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.807
If there's an explanation,
you shoulda gave it

16:14.890 --> 16:18.018
before you brought scumbag Ari in my life
and made me a fucking murderer.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.479
I didn't tell you
to put that cord around his neck.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.444
That's a perfect Carlton response.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.449
You're dead to me, man.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.996

This is a shame. This can stop.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.986
Just tell me where Carlton is.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.030
You tell me where Carlton is and it stops.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.161
You're gonna tell me where Carlton is.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.283
So if you knew all this, why you tell me

17:57.534 --> 17:58.535
you love me?

17:59.661 --> 18:00.913
Because I did.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.002
And I also knew it was the last time
you would ever hear me say those words.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.421
Let me make myself very clear.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.632
Man, I don't ever wanna see you again.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.676
I don't ever wanna hear from you again.

-Okay, boss.

-Hey, Kid, what's up?
-Just chillin'.

-Hey.

-Can I get a selfie?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.105
Yeah. We can take a couple.

-Fuck.
-I appreciate you.

-Let's run. Move.
-What?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.908
-We gotta go this way.
-Shit.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.085
Shit. Shit.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.382
-Watch out! Shit!

19:38.635 --> 19:40.137
Move! Shit!

19:44.183 --> 19:45.851
-Hersch!

19:45.934 --> 19:47.352
Stay down!

19:47.436 --> 19:48.604
Run! Shit! Go!

19:50.689 --> 19:53.275
<i>Alert. There's</i>
<i>an active shooter in the building.</i>

19:53.358 --> 19:54.776
<i>Please shelter in place.</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:55.777
Here, here, here.

19:56.445 --> 20:00.032
<i>There's an active shooter</i>
<i>in the building. Please shelter in place.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:06.663
<i>Alert. There is an active shooter</i>
<i>in the building. Please shelter in place.</i>

20:08.165 --> 20:10.667
<i>There is an active shooter</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

20:10.751 --> 20:12.544
<i>-Please shelter in place.</i>

20:15.589 --> 20:17.132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.842
Yeah, now what?

20:18.926 --> 20:21.178
Come on.
Can we just talk about this?

20:21.261 --> 20:23.513
My brother's got
nothing to do with this, okay?

20:23.597 --> 20:24.473
It's me.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.225
I did it.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.311
Yeah, you fucking loukoumades
donut-eating motherfuckers.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.563
Fuck.

20:34.107 --> 20:34.942
What the--?

20:35.025 --> 20:37.945
<i>Alert. There is an active shooter</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:39.613
<i>Please shelter in place.</i>

20:41.240 --> 20:42.824
K, Let's go.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.913
Come on, let's go!
What the fuck are you doing?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.833
When the cops get here,
just let me do all the talking.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.419
I'm gonna handle them.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.462
Kid!

20:56.004 --> 20:57.965
What the fuck
are you doing, man? Let's go.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.550
I got this. I know just what to say.

21:01.093 --> 21:01.927
Come on, man!

21:02.010 --> 21:03.262
C.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.714
Okay…

21:55.897 --> 22:00.027
You know, you always told me that
I needed protection from everybody else.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.404
But I don't.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.198
I needed protection from you.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.492
From fucking you.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.578
Okay.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.380
Help!

22:24.843 --> 22:27.554
Help! Somebody come help me, man.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.349
PPD! PPD! Let me see your hands!

22:30.432 --> 22:33.268
-Put your hands up!
-They killed my fucking brother, man!

22:33.352 --> 22:35.354
We got eyes on them. Down here.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.147
Come on, C!

22:37.230 --> 22:39.941
Come on, man. You gotta get up.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.027
You gotta…

22:42.652 --> 22:44.321
They killed my brother, man!

22:44.404 --> 22:46.281
They killed my fucking brother.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.284
Officer responding
to distress call, arriving on scene.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.286
Assisting me on standby, over.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.914
They killed
my fucking brother, man!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.835
They killed my fucking brother, man.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.090
-You got a pulse?
-Negative.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.133
-Negative.
-Call it in.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.885
C!

23:08.053 --> 23:10.180
C!

23:11.431 --> 23:13.809
They killed my fucking brother, man.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.338
Kid, we're six minutes out.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.090
I'm gonna
let them know you're almost ready.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.258
Okay.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.804
You look like a billion dollars.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.180
Thank you.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.601
I…

23:56.685 --> 23:58.270
I'm sorry about your brother.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.315
-I appreciate it.
-Yeah.

24:03.984 --> 24:04.901
Thank you.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.904
Hey. I talked to Lemon's people.
He's a huge fan of yours.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.615
This isn't gonna be a TMZ thing,
or anything, it's gonna be easy.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.950
-Cool.
-Okay?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.202
-Hey! What up, champ?
-Look at him.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.162
Shit!

24:15.704 --> 24:19.499
This man here checked himself out of
the hospital after getting shot, goddamn.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.085
-Soldier.
-Soldier? He's like a fucking superhero.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.921
He's like you
in <i>The Anti-Verse </i>but real. He's here.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.882
Me in <i>The Anti-Verse.</i>

24:28.508 --> 24:29.593
What up with you?

24:31.553 --> 24:32.512
What's going on?

24:41.229 --> 24:43.690
I heard what you and Carlton
talked about at the game.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.027
Todd, was you aware
all this shit was going on?

24:47.110 --> 24:48.111
What shit?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.448
How did you hear anything?
You left the room.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.409
I left, but I never let the door close.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.078
In case you two decided
to get into a fight again.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.414
But once you mentioned a set-up,

25:01.082 --> 25:02.209
I kept listening.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.503
What is this? What's going on?

25:07.547 --> 25:08.757
Let's talk about it.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.804
Keeping this shit to myself
this entire time, I wanna tell somebody.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.141
Mm.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.559
Fuck it.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.480
All of this shit is happening
because Carlton set me up.

25:24.272 --> 25:28.276
He made me think the chick I brought back
the first night of the concert OD'd.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.404
Called some fat, fake-ass
Greek gangster named Ari

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
who was supposed
to help me get rid of the body,

25:33.698 --> 25:35.909
but instead of doing that,
he tried to extort me.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.913
I didn't like it. So I killed him.
Me and Carlton decided to dump the body.

25:39.996 --> 25:43.959
Out of nowhere, Ari's brothers showed up,
they wanted to hunt down whoever did it.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.003
Carlton panicked.
He set up Gene. I didn't like that.

25:47.754 --> 25:48.880
They killed Gene.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.717
After they killed Gene, they figured out
Carlton was behind the whole thing.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.348
You know the rest.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.813
I shot them after they shot Carlton.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.067
Okay.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.862
You got caught in a web of Carlton's,

26:12.946 --> 26:15.282
you did everything you could
to get out of it,

26:15.365 --> 26:18.034
and you did, and you didn't
bring anybody down with you.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.329
You know, if shit went wrong,
you could have got us killed.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.415
If you're gonna be mad, be mad at Carlton.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.791
Shut the fuck up, Todd.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.252
Fuck.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.629
How much did this damn
Ari dude want from you?

26:30.630 --> 26:31.715
Six million dollars.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.927
You know if anything
would've happened to Billie…

26:37.304 --> 26:39.014
it'd have been you and me, right?

26:39.889 --> 26:42.434
I mean, we cover up so much of your shit.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.852
-All of us!
-Come on, man.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.854
-But nothing like this!
-Come on, man!

26:46.396 --> 26:48.231
I did what I had to do
to protect my family

26:48.315 --> 26:49.733
and to protect my fuckin' friends.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.318
Man, you protect your own ass!

26:53.486 --> 26:54.946
You couldn't come talk to me?

26:59.075 --> 27:01.244
If you want me to continue to protect you…

27:03.747 --> 27:05.332
it's gonna cost you six million dollars.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.583
Fuck off!

27:06.666 --> 27:09.085
No! This is not happening right now. No!

27:09.169 --> 27:10.170
Hey.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.212
Stop.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.423
Stop.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.972
The money is yours, done.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.103
I'd much rather give you the money
than to Carlton or Ari's bitch ass.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.607
The reason why is because
you actually watch my back.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.903
And you gonna continue to watch my back.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.655
Right?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.367
Right?

27:44.496 --> 27:45.455
Right.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.960
Todd, do what you gotta do
to get Hersch his money.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.380
I'm gonna go out here,
gonna tell my story to Don Lemon

27:53.463 --> 27:55.131
and we'll put all this bullshit behind me.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.175
Hold on one second. Hey, Herschel.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.636
Billie know about this?

28:00.929 --> 28:01.888
No.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.810
But I'ma let them know you're coming.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.983
-Excuse me.
-We'll be right with you. One minute.

28:14.067 --> 28:14.901
Thank you.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.541
I mean, Herschel's lost his fucking mind.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.669
I'm gonna talk to him.
We're not giving him six million fucking--

28:32.752 --> 28:34.796
You're not gonna say
a goddamn thing to him.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.340
You and I both know what he's capable of.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.842
Why do we need to see that?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.555
You're gonna call the studio,
you're gonna tell the studio

28:43.638 --> 28:46.391
that I'm putting off
spending time with my son.

28:46.474 --> 28:49.227
Because of that,
I need 31 million dollars instead of 25.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.522
-That's good. That's smart.
-Yeah. You're damn right it is.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.693
How the fuck
are you so calm right now?

28:59.779 --> 29:00.905
I'm calm

29:02.073 --> 29:04.826
because people don't care
about what you're struggling with.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.203
They're here to see a show.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.790
I'll be damned
if I let anything stop mine.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.004
Then I'm not either.
And I'll make sure Hersch gets that money.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.716
This is why I love you, man.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.385
Showtime.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.644
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.854
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.564
Mmm.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.774
You okay?

29:35.857 --> 29:38.777
Yeah, I'm straight.
Now that y'all here, I'm real good.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.570
-What up, man?
-Hey, Dad.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.572
-Wish me luck. All right?
-Mm-hmm.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.073
-We're ready for you.
-Cool.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.284
Ah.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.078
Come and sit right here.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.937
When a person's
back is against the wall,

30:14.020 --> 30:17.065
and they gotta do whatever they can
to keep from losing what they got,

30:18.274 --> 30:20.485
that's when you get
to see who a person is.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.823
Or what they're capable of.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.410
You know that about someone…

30:30.286 --> 30:31.913
Well, then, maybe…

30:31.996 --> 30:34.207
Maybe then you can say that you know them.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.752
But then again, you know that,

30:39.212 --> 30:40.839
maybe you wouldn't want to.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.718
<i>You had no idea your brother</i>
<i>had killed this man, Ari Petrakis,</i>

30:45.802 --> 30:48.805
<i>because Ari and his girlfriend, Simone,</i>
<i>were trying to extort you?</i>

30:48.888 --> 30:49.764
No.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.184
I didn't know.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.814
Look, Don, you can't assume
that just because I'm a celebrity

30:57.897 --> 31:00.191
that I know everything
that's going on around me.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.944
That's not the case.

31:04.988 --> 31:08.741
I'm waiting on information,
just like everybody else, from the cops.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.036
<i>How is this weighing on you,</i>
<i>losing your brother?</i>

31:17.750 --> 31:18.751
It's tough.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.756
I mean, it's hard, you know.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.386
Look, me and my brother, we didn't…

31:28.469 --> 31:30.680
we didn't have
the best situation coming up.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.016
My brother always felt like…

31:34.434 --> 31:37.437
He always felt like
his most important job was protecting me.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.150
And now he's gone.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.988
He's gone.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.244
I don't condone
the things that my brother did at all.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.667
But I do know that he was just trying to…

32:00.460 --> 32:01.794
trying to take care of me.

32:01.878 --> 32:05.006
<i>But that thinking</i>
<i>leads to very tragic results.</i>

32:07.133 --> 32:08.927
<i>Will you continue your tour?</i>

32:17.393 --> 32:18.353
Yeah.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.397
I mean, I don't feel like I have a choice.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.735
This tour is just…

32:27.403 --> 32:29.197
It's just different.
It's more special now.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.407
So, it comes with dedications, you know?

32:33.326 --> 32:36.245
I'm gonna dedicate it
to my good friend Gene Aubachon.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.125
And to my brother.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.252
My brother, Carlton.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.549
You know, um…

32:50.551 --> 32:54.389
the reason why I wanna do that is
because the one thing that they've always

32:55.807 --> 32:58.476
just been so adamant about
was me and my success.

32:58.559 --> 33:02.647
And I know that they would've
wanted me to continue to be successful.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.818
Other than that, I'm just gonna…

33:08.945 --> 33:10.863
I'ma take what happened and…

33:12.490 --> 33:14.409
just try to become the best me.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.580
Um…

33:20.498 --> 33:21.916
Focus on my family.

33:24.627 --> 33:27.797
Allow myself to grow
and be the best guy that I can.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.014
I feel that's the only way
to give my story…

33:38.474 --> 33:39.726
a happy ending.
