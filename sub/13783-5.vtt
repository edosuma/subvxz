01:41.448 --> 01:44.212
Tuft off a recently
decapitated Indian...

01:44.251 --> 01:45.980
25¢.

01:51.558 --> 01:53.822
Authentic heathen
hair tufts.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.021
Head brought to camp
same day

01:56.062 --> 01:58.257
as Wild Bill Hickok
was killed.

01:58.298 --> 02:00.630
25¢ a tuft,

02:00.667 --> 02:02.999
or five tufts for $1.

02:03.036 --> 02:07.038
25¢ a tuft!

02:15.916 --> 02:20.285
Don't miss your chance
at a fine souvenir, boys,

02:20.320 --> 02:22.652
authentic heathen
hair tufts.

02:22.689 --> 02:24.919
Send them east
to friends and family.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.256
And if you was to say
in your letter

02:27.294 --> 02:29.194
with the tufts
inside it,

02:29.229 --> 02:31.459
it was you who cut
the cocksucker's head off,

02:31.498 --> 02:33.523
who'd be there
to gainsay it?

02:33.567 --> 02:36.195
Anyone may join
the jurors' line.

02:36.236 --> 02:39.672
Only those admitted
to the bar

02:39.706 --> 02:42.470
may join the line
of candidates

02:42.509 --> 02:45.171
for officers
of the court.

02:47.347 --> 02:50.748
Jurors will be drawn
from the hat on my right.

02:50.784 --> 02:54.948
Officers of the court,
in the box on my left.

02:54.988 --> 02:57.479
I have no say
in either outcome,

02:57.524 --> 03:00.584
so please don't
try to bribe me.

03:00.627 --> 03:04.495
- Newspaper fella seems a good sort.
- He's all right.

03:04.531 --> 03:07.864
How far into the process
you think he'll stay involved?

03:07.901 --> 03:10.665
Till them shysters
take over.

03:22.883 --> 03:24.783
I don't know what's
become of the woman

03:24.818 --> 03:26.945
who was Mr. Hickok's
friend.

03:26.987 --> 03:29.455
Probably drunk
over his murder.

03:29.489 --> 03:31.514
Well, there's a child
to be considered.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.719
And she couldn't
be doing better.

03:35.962 --> 03:38.192
Despite her situation.

03:39.566 --> 03:41.557
I don't see
your medicine.

03:41.601 --> 03:43.569
No, I broke
the bottle.

03:43.603 --> 03:45.298
All right.

03:47.607 --> 03:50.576
- No!
- I don't know if this is the time

03:50.610 --> 03:53.272
for you to stop taking
this laudanum.

03:53.313 --> 03:55.508
Oh, what a pleasant
surprise, Doctor.

03:55.549 --> 03:58.484
to hear you admit the limits
of your knowledge.

04:04.658 --> 04:06.649
Have you made
any traveI plans?

04:09.496 --> 04:12.590
Before his murder,
Mr. Hickok arranged

04:12.632 --> 04:14.998
with a Mr. Bullock
to look after my affairs here.

04:15.035 --> 04:16.696
That's good.
That'll...

04:16.736 --> 04:18.795
that'll free you
up to leave.

04:23.643 --> 04:27.272
25¢,
25¢ a tuft!

04:27.314 --> 04:29.475
Hair from the heathen
dead less than one day.

04:29.516 --> 04:32.747
25¢,
25¢ a tuft!

04:32.786 --> 04:34.845
These are good boots
you people sold me.

04:34.888 --> 04:36.879
Glad you're satisfied.

04:36.957 --> 04:38.857
Hair from a heathen
dead less than one day!

04:38.892 --> 04:41.122
Cut that shit out!

04:41.161 --> 04:43.186
No law against me
selling these, mister.

04:43.229 --> 04:45.959
No law either against me
breaking your fucking jaw

04:45.999 --> 04:48.263
if you don't quit it!

04:51.137 --> 04:53.799
Put him out here like
a goddamned circus freak!

04:53.840 --> 04:56.365
Whoa, I'm not making
a penny from this.

04:56.409 --> 04:58.934
People just wanted
to pay their respects.

04:58.979 --> 05:02.437
Well, I had him here
around the side,

05:02.482 --> 05:05.144
but they knocked
the damn tent over.

05:10.190 --> 05:12.420
Man has
a powerfuI temper.

05:12.459 --> 05:15.860
That hardware cocksucker's
been an ongoing pain in my balls

05:15.895 --> 05:17.920
since him and his partner
showed up.

05:17.964 --> 05:20.455
Where do you suppose
that heathen's head got to

05:20.500 --> 05:22.832
them tufts of hair
came off of, Al?

05:22.869 --> 05:24.200
Yeah, I don't know.

05:24.237 --> 05:26.535
Didn't some Mexican bring
the head in for bounty?

05:26.573 --> 05:29.974
If it's important to you,
I'll look it up in my yesterday's diary.

05:30.010 --> 05:32.308
Couldn't matter less.

05:32.345 --> 05:33.937
As far as
the trial itself,

05:33.980 --> 05:36.039
I got no problem
acting as host.

05:36.082 --> 05:38.175
Loss of revenues
notwithstanding.

05:38.218 --> 05:40.209
Well, I'm happy
to have it at my joint,

05:40.253 --> 05:42.346
but being you're senior
in the community,

05:42.389 --> 05:45.381
it seems somehow...
out of place.

05:45.425 --> 05:47.916
Anyways,
we'll have it here.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.792
But just let me say this once
in your hearing.

05:52.832 --> 05:55.062
For outright stupidity,

05:55.101 --> 05:58.502
the whole fucking trial concept
goes shoulder to shoulder

05:58.538 --> 06:01.166
with Custer's thinking
when he headed for that ridge.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.141
It's got
its disadvantages.

06:03.176 --> 06:05.701
We're illegal.

06:05.745 --> 06:10.011
Our whole goal is to get annexed
to the United States.

06:10.050 --> 06:11.779
We start
holding trials,

06:11.818 --> 06:14.548
what's to keep the United States
Congress from saying,

06:14.587 --> 06:16.145
"Oh excuse us,
we didn't realize

06:16.189 --> 06:18.384
you were a sovereign community
and nation out there.

06:18.425 --> 06:20.222
Where's your
cocksucker's flag?

06:20.260 --> 06:21.887
Where's your fucking navy
or the like?

06:21.928 --> 06:24.089
Maybe when we make
our treaty with the Sioux,

06:24.130 --> 06:26.724
we should treat you people
like renegade Indians,

06:26.766 --> 06:30.395
deny your gold and property claims
and hand everything over instead

06:30.437 --> 06:32.200
to our ne'er-do-well cousins
and brother's-in-law"?

06:32.238 --> 06:33.762
That we don't want.

06:35.175 --> 06:39.635
But, if we're gonna
have the fucking thing,

06:39.679 --> 06:42.614
might as well have it
in my joint, huh?

06:42.649 --> 06:45.516
Tom Smith of Lead!

06:45.552 --> 06:47.645
Juror number seven!

06:47.687 --> 06:50.554
- How's business?
- Hot and cold.

06:50.590 --> 06:53.081
Struggling to get
our craps concept off the ground.

06:53.126 --> 06:55.060
That's the way
with any new idea.

06:55.095 --> 06:58.826
- Takes the hoople-heads time to adjust.
- SamueI Smith.

06:58.865 --> 07:00.662
Sometimes I wish we could
just hit 'em over the head,

07:00.700 --> 07:02.725
rob 'em and throw their bodies
in the creek.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.397
But that
would be wrong.

07:09.876 --> 07:13.243
Jay Johnson,
Spearfish.

07:14.714 --> 07:16.579
Juror number 10!

07:20.019 --> 07:22.954
- Mr. Bullock?
- Doc?

07:22.989 --> 07:25.184
I just seen
Mrs. Garret.

07:25.225 --> 07:26.954
I've got a proxy
for her to sign.

07:26.993 --> 07:29.461
You oughta go ahead
and get that done

07:29.496 --> 07:31.487
so she can go ahead
and leave camp.

07:31.531 --> 07:33.726
Anything else on your schedule
I'm behind on?

07:33.767 --> 07:36.292
No, sir.

07:37.637 --> 07:42.631
I will now draw from the lawyers'
business cards in the box,

07:42.675 --> 07:46.304
the presiding magistrate,
prosecutor

07:46.346 --> 07:48.473
and counseI for the defense.

07:48.515 --> 07:50.574
After that part's over,

07:50.617 --> 07:52.585
and not prejudging
the evidence...

07:52.619 --> 07:54.644
why don't we try the cocksucker
at my place?

07:54.687 --> 07:56.587
Second.

07:58.091 --> 08:01.583
Officers of the court,
magistrate...

08:01.628 --> 08:04.324
There's a cripple
who'd do,

08:04.364 --> 08:06.628
if I could pry her
from Mr. Swearengen.

08:08.735 --> 08:10.635
How much money
would loosen his grip?

08:10.670 --> 08:13.537
More likely Al would bridle
at breaking his routine.

08:13.573 --> 08:16.167
He likes to berate the gimp
mornings.

08:16.209 --> 08:18.268
I cannot see
to this child.

08:18.311 --> 08:20.575
She needs someone
less distracted.

08:20.613 --> 08:22.945
I wish to see you
extricated

08:22.982 --> 08:26.008
from all these complications
and difficulties, Mrs. Garret,

08:26.052 --> 08:29.180
- as much as you do yourself.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Farnum.

08:29.222 --> 08:31.349
And in that regard,
wonder if you've

08:31.391 --> 08:34.019
decided on my bid
for your claim yet?

08:34.059 --> 08:37.359
- Are you Mr. Bullock?
- Yes.

08:37.397 --> 08:39.193
I'm Alma Garret.

08:39.232 --> 08:41.563
How do you do?

08:41.601 --> 08:45.037
Please excuse me.
I'm spread so thin with my cook out.

08:45.071 --> 08:47.562
I got this
for you to sign.

08:49.576 --> 08:52.602
Have you a pen at the desk,
Mr. Farnum?

08:52.645 --> 08:54.636
Certainly.

08:57.450 --> 09:02.683
Several days ago
I watched you and Wild Bill Hickok

09:02.722 --> 09:07.091
support each other in a gunfight
from the window in my room.

09:07.126 --> 09:09.094
Later,
when Mr. Hickok

09:09.128 --> 09:12.461
spoke so highly,
Mr. Bullock, I-

09:12.498 --> 09:15.467
I imagined it was you.

09:26.412 --> 09:29.074
Mr. Bullock has
authority to act

09:29.115 --> 09:31.345
on my behalf on all matters
relating to the claim.

09:31.384 --> 09:32.578
I see.

09:32.619 --> 09:34.519
In case you couldn't,
I thought I'd tell you.

09:34.554 --> 09:37.955
WonderfuI.
One load off your back.

09:39.659 --> 09:42.287
Let me see about
getting you that cripple.

10:05.985 --> 10:09.250
- Is he dead or alive?
- He's sick.

10:09.289 --> 10:11.382
And we ain't
no hospital!

10:15.328 --> 10:17.853
Number eight's
relocating.

10:17.897 --> 10:21.924
Bundle him up, put some
of Leon's remedy down him

10:21.968 --> 10:23.595
and take him
to the hills.

10:23.636 --> 10:25.900
Can someone else do it,
Mr. Tolliver?

10:27.206 --> 10:29.037
Sure they can.

10:30.176 --> 10:32.371
Shall I get someone else
to take him?

10:36.482 --> 10:38.347
No, I'll do it.

10:38.384 --> 10:40.352
And burn the blanket
afterwards.

10:41.421 --> 10:43.082
Thanks, Bart.

10:44.557 --> 10:47.185
Some do get well, Cy.

10:47.226 --> 10:49.023
His chances will improve
outdoors.

10:49.062 --> 10:51.428
The bracing air.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.664
What are you moving
the tables for?

10:59.706 --> 11:01.697
You said you wanted
the jury right here.

11:01.741 --> 11:04.039
Can't they sit
at separate tables?

11:04.077 --> 11:06.375
Do you want the tables
together or not?

11:06.412 --> 11:09.540
I don't want anything done
that can't be undone

11:09.582 --> 11:12.745
five minutes after
this fiasco concludes.

11:14.153 --> 11:16.121
Clean somewhere
where I can't see you.

11:18.992 --> 11:21.017
Go on,
get fucking!

11:21.060 --> 11:23.324
Have patience
with the widow, Al.

11:23.363 --> 11:25.456
She's give her proxy
to that hardware fella.

11:25.498 --> 11:28.865
Hickok breaks my balls
from the afterlife.

11:28.901 --> 11:31.028
You feeI before he was
murdered,

11:31.070 --> 11:33.368
Hickok enlisted Bullock
in the widow's cause?

11:33.406 --> 11:35.966
Advance the subject
or pick up a broom.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.910
Signing a proxy don't mean
the widow can't do a deal.

11:38.945 --> 11:40.742
It just includes Bullock in.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.543
If the widow trusts
her own judgment,

11:42.582 --> 11:44.880
she don't let Hickok bring
the hardware cocksucker into it.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.477
She's trying
to get off the dope.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.215
Maybe loaded

11:49.255 --> 11:50.984
she'd get her
self-confidence back.

11:51.024 --> 11:53.925
Let me camp beneath
her window and suggest that.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.521
Hickok's half-woman friend's
off somewheres on a tear.

11:57.563 --> 11:59.997
The orphan squarehead's
in the widow's care.

12:00.033 --> 12:02.297
The widow
feels put upon.

12:02.335 --> 12:04.132
She's asked me
to find her some help.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.434
I suggested the gimp.

12:06.472 --> 12:07.700
No!

12:07.740 --> 12:10.971
So as not to put
a whore up first off.

12:11.978 --> 12:14.947
Now, I will
propose Trixie.

12:16.449 --> 12:18.280
As a get-acquainted gift,

12:18.317 --> 12:21.047
she could bring the widow
a good-sized ball of dope.

12:21.087 --> 12:22.679
Yes.

12:22.722 --> 12:24.690
Well thought
through, E.B.

12:28.995 --> 12:30.986
Tell the widow
you have a candidate.

12:32.298 --> 12:34.892
I have to go
look to my roast.

12:34.934 --> 12:39.268
My cook's on the queue
to see Hickok's remains.

12:39.305 --> 12:41.500
Then he'll probably
sneak here for the trial.

12:46.479 --> 12:48.470
Oops.

12:54.087 --> 12:55.554
Reverend.

12:55.588 --> 12:58.113
Uh, sir.

12:58.157 --> 12:59.886
Sir, who stands
for Mr. Hickok?

12:59.926 --> 13:03.123
- What do you mean?
- Mr. Utter has gone to Cheyenne.

13:03.162 --> 13:05.494
And I don't find
Mr. Hickok's woman friend.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.328
Mr. Nuttall
commissioned the coffin,

13:07.366 --> 13:09.459
but wishes
not to participate further.

13:09.502 --> 13:11.732
Now I need guidance
in certain matters.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.671
But I don't know
who stands for him.

13:13.706 --> 13:15.936
What are you
trying to find out?

13:15.975 --> 13:19.433
For example, I thought
"How Firm a Foundation. "

13:20.613 --> 13:22.240
For the hymn.

13:24.150 --> 13:25.549
Sounds a good choice.

13:25.585 --> 13:27.314
- Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.

13:27.353 --> 13:28.843
Might something else
be more appropriate?

13:28.888 --> 13:32.153
- I don't know.
- I think "How Firm a Foundation"

13:32.191 --> 13:33.783
for the hymn
and from the GospeI,

13:33.826 --> 13:35.919
- First Corinthians 12.
- All right.

13:35.962 --> 13:39.363
"If the foot shall say
'Because I am not the hand,

13:39.398 --> 13:41.832
I'm not of the body,'
is it therefore not of the body?

13:41.868 --> 13:44.735
And if the ear shall say
'Because I'm not the eye

13:44.770 --> 13:47.705
I'm not of the body,'
is it therefore not?

13:47.740 --> 13:51.938
Now hath God set the members,
every one of them,

13:51.978 --> 13:54.674
in the body as it
hath pleased Him. "

13:54.714 --> 13:57.706
That is a good choice,
Reverend.

14:01.354 --> 14:03.345
12 and 13, I think.

14:09.962 --> 14:12.089
Are we open
for business?

14:44.530 --> 14:47.556
- I know you.
- I know you, too.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.660
After bumrushin' me outta your fine
hardware establishment,

14:50.703 --> 14:52.671
you didn't see
this comin', did you?

14:52.705 --> 14:55.173
I halfway did,
you droop-eyed cocksucker!

14:55.208 --> 14:56.835
I was born droop-eyed,
all right?

14:56.876 --> 14:59.242
And who do you blame
for the rest of the mess?

14:59.278 --> 15:01.371
Let me ask you this,
cocksucker,

15:01.414 --> 15:04.508
you think they know me
in New York City by now?

15:04.550 --> 15:07.917
If you wasn't tied up
I would kill ya!

15:07.954 --> 15:10.115
Ow, what are you
cryin' for?

15:10.156 --> 15:12.818
- What?
- I'm askin' what you're cryin' for?

15:12.858 --> 15:15.827
Did you love Hickok
so much?

15:15.861 --> 15:17.886
Was you sweethearts?

15:17.930 --> 15:19.921
Did he stick his dick
up your ass?

15:22.168 --> 15:23.999
Hey, Hey!

15:24.036 --> 15:25.697
I'm this man's counseI.

15:31.043 --> 15:33.511
They will pin a rose
on you.

15:36.215 --> 15:38.115
Boy, I'll shake
your hand.

15:38.150 --> 15:41.517
I'm all trussed up
like a Christmas pig.

15:41.554 --> 15:45.046
I would say you're better situated
than your companions.

15:48.127 --> 15:50.789
Well, I'm a hard case
for you, Counselor.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.162
And no mistake,

15:53.199 --> 15:55.963
everyone in there
saw me shoot him.

15:56.002 --> 15:58.596
If you'll let me
set our strategy,

15:58.638 --> 16:01.971
I don't think we'll dispute
what people saw.

16:02.008 --> 16:04.476
Now, I guess you're here
to break me out.

16:06.379 --> 16:08.210
Son, did
James Butler Hickok

16:08.247 --> 16:10.807
ever kill
a relative of yours?

16:10.850 --> 16:13.683
James Butler Hickok?

16:13.719 --> 16:15.209
Wild Bill Hickok.

16:15.254 --> 16:19.213
Did he ever kill a brother
of yours or the like?

16:19.258 --> 16:21.852
- A brother?
- I'm asking you

16:21.894 --> 16:24.226
if what happened
in that saloon

16:24.263 --> 16:28.996
was vengeance for the death
of a family member.

16:29.035 --> 16:32.232
Possibly a brother
in Abilene,

16:32.271 --> 16:34.068
or the like.

16:34.106 --> 16:36.700
A brother in Abilene.

16:53.059 --> 16:54.856
Oh, Christ.

17:03.302 --> 17:05.634
Oh, Jesus.

17:08.674 --> 17:10.232
You all right?

17:13.079 --> 17:16.070
Look, I'm sorry as hell
about all this.

17:16.115 --> 17:18.106
Sorry as hell.

17:18.150 --> 17:21.313
I'm not gonna burn
the fucking blanket. Fuck Cy!

17:24.690 --> 17:27.157
Look, this is not
my fucking fault.

17:28.828 --> 17:30.261
It's not my fault.

17:38.804 --> 17:40.795
Oh, Christ.

17:46.579 --> 17:48.672
Oh, God take me!

17:58.657 --> 18:00.852
What do you look at
out there?

18:00.893 --> 18:02.986
Whatever I can see.

18:03.028 --> 18:05.258
Clean up.

18:05.297 --> 18:07.390
Am I on jury duty?

18:07.433 --> 18:10.766
Put on a decent enough dress
to help a widow with a kid.

18:10.803 --> 18:14.432
What widow in camp
has a kid?

18:14.473 --> 18:17.237
The widow is the New York
dude's widow.

18:17.276 --> 18:19.471
The kid is the orphan
squarehead.

18:19.512 --> 18:22.709
I didn't know she was caring
for that child now.

18:22.748 --> 18:25.717
Does it change
what fucking dress you wear?

18:28.187 --> 18:29.552
No.

18:29.588 --> 18:33.080
Widow's a dope fiend.
She's been drinking it.

18:35.027 --> 18:38.326
Help her expand
her horizons.

18:58.150 --> 19:01.347
I see no guard
outside of room eight.

19:01.387 --> 19:04.379
Yeah, room eight left.

19:04.423 --> 19:05.890
Borne by angels?

19:05.925 --> 19:08.359
You don't have that man
to worry about anymore.

19:08.394 --> 19:10.055
You or me either.
Just...

19:10.095 --> 19:12.586
put the man in room eight
from your mind.

19:12.631 --> 19:15.623
I have no vaccine

19:15.668 --> 19:18.432
for the sickness the man
in room eight didn't have.

19:18.471 --> 19:21.133
The closest place
that does

19:21.173 --> 19:23.573
to my knowledge,
is Fort Kearney.

19:23.609 --> 19:25.474
If you want to remedy

19:25.511 --> 19:28.878
the epidemic that you have
no reason to believe will break out,

19:28.914 --> 19:31.815
I would send somebody there
right away.

19:31.851 --> 19:34.217
Heard you
loud and clear, Doctor.

19:34.253 --> 19:36.016
Will you send someone,
Mr. Tolliver?

19:36.055 --> 19:38.888
If I do, you'll be
the first to know.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.954
If you don't,
and I have to,

19:42.995 --> 19:46.396
that will be known to every
damn person in this camp!

19:56.475 --> 19:58.136
Joey?

20:07.019 --> 20:09.283
You ever had
Nebraska pussy?

20:09.321 --> 20:11.619
Not to my knowledge,
Mr. Tolliver.

20:11.657 --> 20:13.750
Eddie Sawyer,
get in here!

20:16.862 --> 20:18.921
True or not, Eddie,

20:18.964 --> 20:22.058
when a man wets his end
in Nebraska pussy,

20:22.101 --> 20:23.966
his life is
changed forever.

20:24.003 --> 20:25.664
Speaking only
for myself,

20:25.704 --> 20:28.138
I still mark
the anniversary.

20:28.173 --> 20:31.108
Well, point me
in the right direction.

20:31.143 --> 20:33.168
You hear that, Eddie?

20:33.212 --> 20:34.804
Boy's got
a healthy attitude.

20:37.216 --> 20:38.774
Yes, sir?

20:38.817 --> 20:40.717
Come here.

20:44.557 --> 20:47.754
Get this outta here.

20:47.793 --> 20:49.590
Get rid of it?

20:49.628 --> 20:52.791
Did you hear me announce
the other night

20:52.831 --> 20:55.265
that I'd pay a $50 bounty
for every Indian head?

20:55.301 --> 20:58.532
- I was right next to you, Al.
- That's the first head.

20:58.571 --> 21:01.472
Some chili chomper's
out there somewhere

21:01.507 --> 21:02.997
right now
spending my $50.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.101
You get rid of that head,
or you'd better know

21:05.144 --> 21:07.305
of another place with
a position open for an idiot.

21:09.181 --> 21:10.580
All right.

21:10.616 --> 21:12.948
Got a couple places
I can keep it, I guess.

21:12.985 --> 21:14.816
Yeah, till after the trial.

21:14.853 --> 21:17.219
Well, what do you
do with it then?

21:17.256 --> 21:20.521
Put it somewhere
in the bar?

21:20.559 --> 21:22.584
It's a nice
conversation piece.

21:25.931 --> 21:29.094
I mean if it's handled
the right way.

21:32.104 --> 21:35.335
You have been tested,
Al Swearengen.

21:35.374 --> 21:38.309
And your deepest
purposes

21:38.344 --> 21:41.177
proved there's gold
on the woman's claim.

21:41.213 --> 21:44.944
You might as well have
shouted it from the rooftops.

21:48.354 --> 21:51.517
"That's why I'm jumping
through hoops to get it back.

21:51.557 --> 21:55.049
Thorough as I fleeced
the fooI she married,

21:55.094 --> 21:57.585
I will fleece
his widow, too,

21:57.630 --> 22:00.121
using loyal
associates like

22:00.165 --> 22:03.896
Eustace Bailey Farnum
as my go-betweens and dupes.

22:06.939 --> 22:10.568
To explain
why I want her bought out,

22:10.609 --> 22:13.601
I will make a pretext
of my fear of the Pinkertons.

22:15.981 --> 22:18.677
I will throw Farnum
a token thief.

22:18.717 --> 22:20.912
Why should I
reward E.B.

22:20.953 --> 22:23.615
with some
small fractional

22:23.656 --> 22:26.250
participation
in the claim?

22:26.291 --> 22:29.192
Or let him even lay by
a little security

22:29.228 --> 22:32.391
and source of continuing income
for his declining years?

22:34.633 --> 22:36.897
What's he ever
done for me?

22:36.935 --> 22:39.369
Except let me terrify him

22:39.405 --> 22:41.396
every goddamned day
of his life

22:41.440 --> 22:44.341
till the idea
of boweI regularity

22:44.376 --> 22:47.072
is a forlorn
fucking hope.

22:55.421 --> 22:59.619
Not to mention ordering a man
killed in one of E.B.'s rooms.

22:59.658 --> 23:03.492
So every fucking
free moment of his life

23:03.529 --> 23:06.396
E.B. has to spend

23:06.432 --> 23:08.730
scrubbing the bloodstains

23:08.767 --> 23:10.962
off the goddamned floor!

23:15.074 --> 23:17.338
To keep from...

23:19.678 --> 23:22.340
having to lower
his rates. "

23:23.782 --> 23:27.343
God damn that motherfucker!

23:32.791 --> 23:34.850
Rules of the court.

23:34.893 --> 23:36.292
No nonsense.

23:36.328 --> 23:38.262
Prosecution will open.

23:38.297 --> 23:40.322
The defense will respond.

23:40.365 --> 23:43.266
The jury will be charged
and deliberate.

23:43.302 --> 23:45.293
Go ahead.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.841
We shoulder a great
weight here today.

23:53.879 --> 23:57.076
Now we're many of us
miners,

23:57.116 --> 23:59.983
but this is no
claim dispute.

24:00.018 --> 24:01.076
- Christmas.
- Hmm?

24:01.120 --> 24:03.213
We'll be here
till fucking Christmas.

24:09.962 --> 24:11.930
Yesterday,

24:11.964 --> 24:15.491
a man of reputation
was killed in this camp.

24:15.534 --> 24:18.799
Now the killer
had no reputation.

24:18.837 --> 24:21.829
But the circumstances
speak badly enough

24:21.874 --> 24:23.808
about his
character that,

24:23.842 --> 24:26.208
in time to come,
he may get one.

24:26.245 --> 24:28.509
Now we all know that

24:28.547 --> 24:30.811
even though
the killer is a coward,

24:30.849 --> 24:33.545
not all killings
are murders.

24:33.585 --> 24:38.420
You jurors have to decide
if this killing was.

24:38.457 --> 24:42.359
And your decision
will come to this:

24:42.394 --> 24:47.161
either a man giving you
a dollar for breakfast

24:47.199 --> 24:50.168
is provocation
beyond endurance,

24:50.202 --> 24:55.538
or Jack McCall
shooting Wild Bill Hickok

24:55.574 --> 24:59.772
was murder,
pure and simple.

24:59.812 --> 25:02.372
Picked up his pace
towards the end.

25:02.414 --> 25:04.143
Go ahead.

25:04.183 --> 25:06.174
Sir.

25:09.087 --> 25:11.749
Why'd you kill Hickok,
Mr. McCall?

25:15.127 --> 25:17.459
He murdered
my brother in Kansas.

25:17.496 --> 25:20.829
Murdered your
brother in Kansas.

25:24.069 --> 25:26.333
Thank you, son.

25:26.371 --> 25:27.838
Hmm.

25:27.873 --> 25:30.034
Don't count your
fucking chickens.

25:30.075 --> 25:32.475
Go ahead.

25:35.848 --> 25:39.648
When did Hickok murder
your brother, Mr. McCall?

25:39.685 --> 25:41.710
In Kansas, Abilene.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.880
Are you still drunk?

25:43.922 --> 25:46.152
I said when?

25:48.060 --> 25:49.789
I don't recall
the exact year.

25:49.828 --> 25:52.592
When they was
both in Abilene.

25:52.631 --> 25:54.997
And you were present?

25:55.033 --> 25:56.330
Not at shooting, no.

25:56.368 --> 26:00.134
But you were in Abilene
at the time that this happened?

26:00.172 --> 26:02.140
No, when the shooting
happened, no.

26:02.174 --> 26:05.007
Tell that judge
I want to see him.

26:05.043 --> 26:07.068
- Were you ever in Abilene?
- Yes.

26:07.112 --> 26:09.478
Well do you often
play cards, McCall,

26:09.514 --> 26:12.677
for three days with a man
who murdered your brother

26:12.718 --> 26:15.278
before in passion's
white heat

26:15.320 --> 26:17.481
you take your revenge?

26:17.522 --> 26:20.582
No, it wasn't white heat.

26:20.626 --> 26:23.356
I had to
find my chance.

26:23.395 --> 26:25.625
If that's it, I'm calling
a break for nature

26:25.664 --> 26:27.188
and we'll finish later.

26:27.232 --> 26:29.166
Do you even have
a brother, Mr. McCall?

26:29.201 --> 26:32.034
Yeah, and Hickok
killed him.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.833
Break for nature.

26:37.042 --> 26:39.943
Sir?
Sir?

26:39.978 --> 26:42.538
Bullet that killed Hickok
is in my wrist.

26:42.581 --> 26:44.606
Any chance
I could testify?

26:44.650 --> 26:46.447
McCall already admitted
he killed Hickok.

26:46.485 --> 26:48.749
Years to come when
I'm giving talks or the like,

26:48.787 --> 26:51.085
I'd appreciate
if I'd be on the record.

26:51.123 --> 26:52.715
There's $50 in it
for you.

26:52.758 --> 26:55.352
I'd be telling
the truth, sir!

26:58.297 --> 27:00.231
Mrs. Garret?

27:00.265 --> 27:02.893
It's okay.

27:05.537 --> 27:07.164
Who is it?

27:07.205 --> 27:10.197
I'm sent to help you
with the little one.

27:13.745 --> 27:15.474
I'm Trixie.

27:17.816 --> 27:20.444
Thank you for coming
at such short notice, Trixie.

27:27.793 --> 27:29.556
Ain't you pretty?

27:32.197 --> 27:34.722
I'm sorry about
your husband, ma'am.

27:36.768 --> 27:39.259
It's good of you
to care for the child.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.834
I was under the impression
you were hurt.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.137
Ma'am?

27:45.177 --> 27:47.941
Mr. Farnum said
you had some sort of

27:47.980 --> 27:49.880
physical liability?

27:51.316 --> 27:54.376
I'm not her.
She's lovely, though, JeweI.

27:56.188 --> 27:58.383
May I wash her?
Give her a nice bath?

27:58.423 --> 28:00.357
Of course.

28:00.392 --> 28:02.451
All right, little one.

28:13.005 --> 28:15.132
She doesn't
speak English.

28:16.975 --> 28:18.602
I'm Trixie.

28:18.643 --> 28:20.838
Trixie.

28:29.054 --> 28:30.885
You want a blow job
while I talk to you?

28:30.922 --> 28:32.981
No.

28:33.025 --> 28:35.255
I wasn't offering it
personally.

28:35.293 --> 28:36.988
Make your point.

28:37.029 --> 28:39.657
My point is...

28:39.698 --> 28:41.632
before a guilty verdict

28:41.666 --> 28:43.531
would get executed
on that cocksucker,

28:43.568 --> 28:47.868
three men would walk in
that meat locker where he's being held

28:47.906 --> 28:50.397
with bags over their heads
and cut his fucking throat.

28:50.442 --> 28:52.740
Within half an hour
those celestial little pigs

28:52.778 --> 28:55.110
will be on their backs
with their hooves in the air

28:55.147 --> 28:56.637
belching up
human remains.

28:56.681 --> 28:59.411
Are you saying you'd
order that to be done?

28:59.451 --> 29:03.148
I'm saying
I had a vision

29:03.188 --> 29:05.179
it would happen.

29:05.223 --> 29:07.282
My second of the day.

29:07.325 --> 29:09.293
First come when
I was watching

29:09.327 --> 29:11.158
you and them lawyers
on line this morning.

29:11.196 --> 29:15.758
They began to slither
in my sight like vipers.

29:15.801 --> 29:18.065
So as not to puke
I had to close my eyes.

29:18.103 --> 29:19.968
The vision went on.

29:20.005 --> 29:22.974
Got worse.

29:23.008 --> 29:25.033
I saw the vipers
in the big nest in Washington.

29:25.077 --> 29:26.669
They were taking us
in the camp

29:26.711 --> 29:30.272
for acting like we could
set our own laws up or organizations.

29:30.315 --> 29:32.909
And then I saw the big viper
decide to strangle

29:32.951 --> 29:35.920
and swallow us up and every
fucking thing we gain here.

29:35.954 --> 29:37.285
It was horrible.

29:37.322 --> 29:40.120
How could we
fucking avoid it?

29:40.158 --> 29:42.683
How could we let the vipers
in the big nest know

29:42.727 --> 29:44.957
that we didn't wanna cause
any fucking trouble?

29:44.996 --> 29:46.964
And that's when you
had your second vision?

29:46.998 --> 29:48.989
Yeah, the cutthroats
and the pigs.

29:49.034 --> 29:51.161
But who wants all that
blood spilled, Judge?

29:51.203 --> 29:53.865
Isn't there a simpler way

29:53.905 --> 29:56.203
of not pissing off
the big vipers?

30:03.482 --> 30:06.144
I want to get back
to the trial.

30:06.184 --> 30:07.742
Go ahead.

30:20.699 --> 30:22.633
How do you suppose
the trial's going?

30:22.667 --> 30:26.228
- I don't know.
- Should've took him into the territory.

30:26.271 --> 30:28.705
Hang 'em here, they'll be
opening a can a worms.

30:28.740 --> 30:31.709
Guess it's all
a can a worms.

30:31.743 --> 30:33.711
Now you're talking.

30:34.813 --> 30:36.371
Will you help me
with the body?

30:40.652 --> 30:42.620
Good talk?

30:42.654 --> 30:44.349
We'll see.

30:44.389 --> 30:45.617
Mm.

30:45.657 --> 30:47.557
You see that one?

30:47.592 --> 30:49.560
Him, that one there
in the middle.

30:49.594 --> 30:51.357
- The curly hair?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:51.396 --> 30:54.559
Told me the other night
how bad Hickok needed killing.

30:54.599 --> 30:56.032
Yeah.

30:56.067 --> 30:58.627
Said Hickok insulted him
in the street.

30:58.670 --> 31:01.070
Hope he's got
a forcefuI personality.

31:03.608 --> 31:05.337
We're back in session.

31:06.845 --> 31:10.110
This camp is part of no territory,
state or nation.

31:10.148 --> 31:13.117
Stars and stripes
may fly here soon,

31:13.151 --> 31:15.244
but that day
is not here yet.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.847
You of the jury therefore
are without the law

31:17.889 --> 31:19.823
upon which
to decide this case.

31:19.858 --> 31:22.725
And how then
are you to decide it?

31:22.761 --> 31:26.322
You must rely
on common custom.

31:26.364 --> 31:28.662
That McCall killed Hickok
is not in dispute.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.634
He says he was
taking revenge,

31:30.669 --> 31:32.330
that Hickok
murdered his brother.

31:32.370 --> 31:36.534
If you believe
what he says to be true

31:36.575 --> 31:40.671
custom dictates
that you excuse him.

31:42.113 --> 31:44.809
The jury will now retire
to the whores' rooms

31:44.849 --> 31:47.249
and begin
their deliberations.

31:50.956 --> 31:54.357
- Suppose Ellsworth's with us?
- Oh yeah, four square.

32:05.837 --> 32:07.771
Open the bar.

32:07.806 --> 32:10.707
Get the girls fucking
till the jury comes back.

32:10.742 --> 32:12.972
The downstairs rooms
is occupied.

32:13.011 --> 32:15.104
Upstairs ain't.

32:15.146 --> 32:16.704
True.

32:25.090 --> 32:26.648
Strike me dead.

32:26.691 --> 32:30.286
I apologize.

32:30.328 --> 32:34.389
Please,
I hurt so much now.

32:42.574 --> 32:45.304
You're one sick
fucking customer.

32:45.343 --> 32:48.141
I apologize.

32:48.179 --> 32:50.010
Don't apologize
to me.

32:50.048 --> 32:51.709
I don't even
fucking know ya!

32:53.051 --> 32:54.746
You want a drink
of whiskey?

32:55.954 --> 32:57.387
No lip in the bottle,

32:57.422 --> 32:59.515
but I got a pretty steady
pouring hand.

32:59.557 --> 33:01.491
I apologize.

33:01.526 --> 33:03.653
Accepted.
Open your yap!

33:05.363 --> 33:06.853
Hey!

33:06.898 --> 33:08.559
Open up!

33:12.537 --> 33:14.266
More for me
anyhow.

33:19.177 --> 33:21.111
I apologize.

33:24.416 --> 33:26.008
Hey.

33:26.051 --> 33:28.451
My best friend died.

33:29.854 --> 33:33.620
The man I had my best friend-feeling
about in the world.

33:33.658 --> 33:35.523
Took you as he found you,

33:35.560 --> 33:37.824
thought the best of you.

33:37.862 --> 33:40.888
Sweet to me!

33:40.932 --> 33:43.059
I apologize.

33:50.008 --> 33:54.308
Maybe you would
rather have some water?

33:56.514 --> 33:58.675
I will go get some
from the creek.

34:00.285 --> 34:02.253
But if you don't
stop 'pologizing,

34:02.287 --> 34:04.312
I'm not gonna give you
a goddamn drop.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.358
All right, mister?!

34:08.393 --> 34:10.452
I'm coming back
with some water.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.263
I apologize.

34:17.302 --> 34:19.293
Shut the fuck up!

34:19.337 --> 34:21.304
Look how pretty
you are.

34:21.339 --> 34:23.364
Pretty girI.

34:26.678 --> 34:28.942
Are you poorly?

34:28.980 --> 34:30.413
Crampy?

34:30.447 --> 34:32.574
Yes.

34:32.617 --> 34:35.518
Does laudanum help?

34:35.553 --> 34:37.145
It used to.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.822
It doesn't anymore.

34:40.859 --> 34:43.692
Are you afraid?

34:45.096 --> 34:46.757
Yes.

34:46.797 --> 34:49.289
I was awfuI afraid
when I was stopping.

34:49.333 --> 34:52.462
First I was afraid
I was gonna die.

34:52.504 --> 34:54.335
And then I was
afraid I wouldn't.

34:54.371 --> 34:57.364
And then one day
I woke up...

34:57.409 --> 34:59.536
free.

35:04.682 --> 35:07.708
I don't know why
I didn't think to put her

35:07.752 --> 35:09.743
in one of my camisoles.

35:11.823 --> 35:14.223
No, but you look
how pretty she looks in it.

35:14.259 --> 35:16.523
Look at her.

35:26.237 --> 35:27.966
May I confide?

35:28.006 --> 35:29.735
Certainly.

35:29.774 --> 35:32.174
I've never been laid
in Nebraska.

35:32.210 --> 35:34.872
We all of us
sometimes embellish.

35:34.913 --> 35:37.609
I feeI unburdened.

35:37.649 --> 35:39.276
Happy to help.

35:41.052 --> 35:43.020
What did you
send him to get?

35:43.054 --> 35:45.522
If I haven't
said yet, Eddie,

35:45.557 --> 35:47.218
you think asking's
gonna make me?

35:52.597 --> 35:55.327
Look at the lady.

35:55.366 --> 35:57.994
It's quiet, I thought
I would see Hickok buried.

35:58.036 --> 35:59.333
Sure.

35:59.370 --> 36:01.861
Sure, what?

36:01.906 --> 36:03.703
Sure, Joanie,
go ahead.

36:03.741 --> 36:07.302
Or was your point you
weren't asking permission?

36:14.452 --> 36:16.283
Conscience struck.

36:16.321 --> 36:19.051
Needs to sing a hymn.

36:19.090 --> 36:21.081
She liked Andy.

36:21.125 --> 36:23.457
I did too.

37:10.141 --> 37:12.234
Doc?

37:12.277 --> 37:14.472
I'm in the back!

37:14.512 --> 37:16.503
Well, I won't
trouble nothing.

37:18.483 --> 37:20.417
- Hi, Doc.
- What is it?

37:20.451 --> 37:23.852
Couple years ago
I took powders.

37:23.888 --> 37:25.788
Getting some
awfuI cramping.

37:25.823 --> 37:29.190
- I wish I knew what was in 'em.
- That'd be helpfuI.

37:29.227 --> 37:32.162
Brownish like.

37:32.196 --> 37:34.027
I put 'em in my tea.

37:34.065 --> 37:36.556
Well, if it's the monthlys,
I generally prescribe

37:36.601 --> 37:38.626
a day or two of laudanum
against the cramps.

37:38.670 --> 37:40.865
Coming off the laudanum's
what had me crampy.

37:40.905 --> 37:44.932
Then you used it
for more than a few days.

37:44.976 --> 37:46.841
Little longer, yeah.

37:46.878 --> 37:49.142
Between 12 and...

37:49.180 --> 37:52.013
however old I was
three years ago.

37:52.050 --> 37:54.018
Have you taken 'em
back up again?

37:54.052 --> 37:56.816
It's the rich woman
wants to stop.

37:56.854 --> 37:59.721
- The widow.
- And what's that to you?

37:59.757 --> 38:02.089
Or to you
why I be interested?

38:06.931 --> 38:09.661
I won't swear

38:09.701 --> 38:12.602
this is your
sovereign remedy.

38:12.637 --> 38:16.471
But the color
will be right.

38:18.643 --> 38:21.237
And it should give her
some relief.

38:25.550 --> 38:27.484
Thanks, Doc.

38:27.518 --> 38:31.614
It's a little enough
to do with what's coming.

38:31.656 --> 38:34.090
What would that be?

38:34.125 --> 38:36.218
And what would
that be to you?

38:41.399 --> 38:43.492
Finish your business.

38:43.534 --> 38:45.024
The jury's coming back.

38:45.069 --> 38:47.060
Hurry it up!

39:10.128 --> 39:12.790
What's the verdict?

39:21.105 --> 39:22.834
Innocent.

39:24.876 --> 39:27.208
Thank you.

39:27.245 --> 39:29.304
The defendant
is free.

39:30.615 --> 39:32.606
Don't ever knock
this camp to me.

39:43.628 --> 39:45.357
Good luck, son.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.957
I need a drink.

39:54.038 --> 39:56.529
Mr. Hickok will lie
beside two brothers.

39:56.574 --> 39:58.872
One he likely killed,
the other he killed for certain

39:58.910 --> 40:01.071
and he's been
killed now in turn.

40:01.112 --> 40:03.478
So much blood.

40:03.514 --> 40:07.006
And on the battlefields
of the brothers' war,

40:07.051 --> 40:09.178
I saw more blood
than this.

40:09.220 --> 40:12.986
And asked then as for the purpose,
and did not know.

40:13.024 --> 40:15.151
And don't know
the purpose now.

40:15.193 --> 40:18.924
But know now to testify
that not knowing,

40:19.964 --> 40:21.625
I believe.

40:23.568 --> 40:26.162
Saint PauI tells us
by one's spirit

40:26.204 --> 40:28.695
are we all baptized
in the one body.

40:28.740 --> 40:32.471
Whether we be Jew or gentile,
bond or free.

40:32.510 --> 40:35.809
And have all been made
to drink into one spirit.

40:35.847 --> 40:38.577
For the body is not one member,
but many.

40:38.616 --> 40:42.382
He tells us, "The eye
cannot say unto the hand,

40:42.420 --> 40:44.183
'I have no need
of thee. '

40:44.222 --> 40:46.213
Nor again,
the head to the feet,

40:46.257 --> 40:47.656
'I have no need of thee. '

40:47.692 --> 40:49.717
They much more
those members of the body

40:49.761 --> 40:51.228
which seem to be
more feeble.

40:51.262 --> 40:52.991
And those
members of the body

40:53.030 --> 40:54.964
which we think
of as less honorable,

40:54.999 --> 40:56.899
all are necessary. "

40:56.934 --> 41:01.234
He says that there should be
no schism in the body,

41:01.272 --> 41:05.231
but that the members should have
the same care, one to another.

41:05.276 --> 41:07.710
And where
the one member suffer,

41:07.745 --> 41:10.771
all the members
suffer with it.

41:14.786 --> 41:17.186
I believe
in God's purpose,

41:17.221 --> 41:19.189
not knowing it.

41:19.223 --> 41:22.750
I ask Him,
moving in me,

41:22.794 --> 41:25.024
to allow me
to see His will.

41:25.062 --> 41:27.189
I ask Him,

41:28.566 --> 41:30.431
moving in others,

41:32.069 --> 41:33.832
to allow them to see it.

41:40.311 --> 41:42.575
Let us sing
"How Firm a Foundation"

41:42.613 --> 41:44.604
as Mr. Hickok is laid
to rest.

41:53.658 --> 41:56.149
& When through &

41:56.194 --> 42:00.722
& Fiery trials &

42:00.765 --> 42:06.226
& Thy pathways shall lie &

42:08.406 --> 42:11.136
& My grace &

42:11.175 --> 42:13.905
& All sufficient &

42:15.813 --> 42:20.807
& Shall be thy supply &

42:23.754 --> 42:26.222
& The flame &

42:26.257 --> 42:29.454
& Shall not hurt thee &

42:31.329 --> 42:35.823
& I only design... &

42:37.335 --> 42:38.825
They turned him loose.

42:38.870 --> 42:41.703
- McCall?
- They turned him loose.

42:45.176 --> 42:51.411
& And thy gold
to refine. &

43:49.607 --> 43:51.507
- Can we get started?
- He's near done.

43:51.542 --> 43:53.305
Oh, you can tell?

43:57.715 --> 44:00.240
Can you believe
they let the son of a bitch go?

44:00.284 --> 44:02.275
Yeah, I guess I can.
Here he comes.

44:04.388 --> 44:06.288
Oh, thank you
for waiting.

44:06.324 --> 44:08.952
You've been so kind to me,
a stranger.

44:08.993 --> 44:11.484
Many of us have asked
being broken,

44:11.529 --> 44:13.156
"How are we to live?"

44:13.197 --> 44:14.926
You took me into
the body of the camp.

44:14.966 --> 44:17.025
I'm from
Etobicoke, Ontario.

44:17.068 --> 44:19.036
I'm from
Vienna, Austria.

44:19.070 --> 44:21.971
May I ask,
Mr. Bullock,

44:22.006 --> 44:24.236
what you feeI now
may be your part?

44:24.275 --> 44:26.300
Can't say I know what you're
talking about.

44:26.344 --> 44:28.437
I would not impose,
it's been given me to ask.

44:28.479 --> 44:30.538
You did what you've
been given to do.

44:30.581 --> 44:33.243
The camp was lucky
you were here today.

44:33.284 --> 44:35.275
No, I'm a frall
and feeble vesseI,

44:35.319 --> 44:37.184
but none of us can
deny our parts-

44:37.221 --> 44:39.553
Can we finish the goddamned
walk in quiet?

44:41.759 --> 44:43.750
Certainly, sir.

44:46.430 --> 44:48.421
Sorry, Reverend.

45:13.657 --> 45:15.648
Can I get your autograph
please?

45:20.331 --> 45:22.799
There you go,
that's for you.

45:22.833 --> 45:26.826
Should it ever be
your misfortune, gentlemen,

45:26.871 --> 45:30.170
or mine
to need to kill a man,

45:30.207 --> 45:34.007
then let us toast together
the possibility

45:34.045 --> 45:37.242
that our trials
be held in this camp.

45:37.281 --> 45:40.273
Here, here.

45:40.317 --> 45:42.342
What's your name?
It's Jack, ain't it?

45:42.386 --> 45:44.786
Yes, sir.
You buy me a drink,

45:44.822 --> 45:46.187
I'll make my mark.

45:46.223 --> 45:48.316
Stick around camp, Jack.

45:48.359 --> 45:50.589
I will make mine for you.

45:50.628 --> 45:53.358
What in the hell's
that supposed to mean?

45:53.397 --> 45:55.627
Means there's a horse for you
outside you want to get on

45:55.666 --> 45:57.759
before somebody murders you
who gives a fuck

45:57.802 --> 45:59.861
about right and wrong,
or I do.

46:02.406 --> 46:04.704
It's the paint, Jack.

46:04.742 --> 46:07.006
Right outside my joint.

46:07.044 --> 46:09.877
Run for your fucking life.

46:14.952 --> 46:17.580
Jack McCall
runs from no man.

46:25.663 --> 46:28.962
Remember this when you run
your own place.

46:28.999 --> 46:32.526
That type guy hanging round
gets people agitated.

46:34.271 --> 46:37.570
Forces 'em to take a position,
one side or the other.

46:39.243 --> 46:43.179
And agitation brings a slight
bump-up in whiskey sales.

46:43.214 --> 46:46.411
But the sale of cunt
plummets.

46:46.450 --> 46:48.680
That's why I often wonder
if I should take

46:48.719 --> 46:50.710
that fucking picture
of Lincoln down.

46:57.895 --> 47:01.258
Come on.

47:04.068 --> 47:05.558
Yah, yah.

47:19.083 --> 47:20.846
It's me, mister!

47:22.319 --> 47:24.310
Back with water.

47:35.666 --> 47:37.327
Are you dead?!

47:47.578 --> 47:50.445
Yeah!
There you are.

47:52.049 --> 47:54.711
Choking and coughing
just like the rest of us.

47:59.757 --> 48:02.590
Saw the widow's husband
in the creek.

48:02.626 --> 48:05.117
'Less they're keeping
more than one body cooI

48:05.162 --> 48:07.027
for shipping back East.

48:07.064 --> 48:09.532
Tethered,
wrapped up,

48:09.567 --> 48:11.933
and floating
like a lure

48:11.969 --> 48:13.630
for some huge
fucking fish.

48:16.574 --> 48:18.906
The widow's
got the little one now.

48:18.943 --> 48:21.707
I had her for a while,

48:21.745 --> 48:25.647
but I ain't the type
she should be with long term.

48:25.683 --> 48:28.015
Fucking drunk
and so forth.

48:32.590 --> 48:34.524
And when I was
down at the creek

48:34.558 --> 48:37.584
I heard voices

48:39.330 --> 48:41.321
and I went to where
they were singing.

48:43.334 --> 48:47.498
And I saw as they laid
my poor Bill to rest.

48:59.250 --> 49:03.152
Now there's a bird
I ain't never seen before.

49:05.823 --> 49:07.950
Shall I talk about it
to you?

49:53.237 --> 49:55.102
The man is a lunatic.

49:55.139 --> 49:56.936
High water,
he never made much sense.

49:56.974 --> 49:58.771
But now he just
utters pure gibberish.

49:58.809 --> 50:00.436
Did he look pale
to you?

50:00.477 --> 50:02.411
- What?
- Did he seem pale?

50:02.446 --> 50:04.641
How the fuck do I know
if he was pale or not?

50:04.682 --> 50:07.173
- He looked pale to me.
- What if he was?

50:07.217 --> 50:09.447
Let's say he was.
Will you shut up about it?

50:10.721 --> 50:12.780
What is my part
and your part?

50:12.823 --> 50:15.121
What part of my part
is your part?

50:15.159 --> 50:16.751
Is my foot your knee?

50:16.794 --> 50:19.388
What about your ear?
What the fuck is that?

50:19.430 --> 50:22.126
Yeah.
I don't know.

50:22.166 --> 50:24.259
What don't you know?

50:24.301 --> 50:26.132
If he was pale or not?

50:26.170 --> 50:28.138
What you're supposed
to do.

50:28.172 --> 50:30.470
I'm not supposed
to do anything!

50:30.507 --> 50:32.304
Let's agree to that.

50:32.343 --> 50:35.312
Not one fucking thing
that I don't decide I'm gonna.

50:35.346 --> 50:36.870
All right, SoI?

50:36.914 --> 50:38.643
All right.

50:40.317 --> 50:42.148
Suspenders.

50:43.787 --> 50:45.652
God damn it!

50:48.258 --> 50:50.954
If I kill the droop-eyed
son of a bitch

50:50.994 --> 50:54.555
and my part's getting hanged for it,
good luck with the fucking store.

50:54.598 --> 50:56.122
All right.

50:56.166 --> 50:58.191
I will write to Martha
and see it posted.

50:58.235 --> 51:01.102
- You look out after that widow.
- All right, Seth.

51:01.138 --> 51:03.106
Can I impose on you
to pack a bag for me

51:03.140 --> 51:05.108
to cut down
on the cocksucker's head start?

51:05.142 --> 51:07.872
Be ready for you
when you ride out.

51:07.911 --> 51:09.674
Thanks, SoI.

51:39.543 --> 51:42.535
Did you get the praying
outta your system?

53:34.358 --> 53:35.689
Yah!

53:52.242 --> 53:57.509
& God and man played
hide and go seek &

54:00.651 --> 54:05.987
& God go, "Man now,
man, don't you peek" &

54:09.493 --> 54:11.461
& Man counted to 10 &

54:11.495 --> 54:16.398
& And then looked around &

54:17.868 --> 54:20.098
& But God was nowhere &

54:20.137 --> 54:22.833
& Nowhere to be found &

54:22.873 --> 54:24.704
& Ha ha ha,
that's right &

54:26.977 --> 54:30.003
& Now God is in you &

54:30.047 --> 54:33.642
& And God is in me &

54:35.419 --> 54:38.183
& And to love all of God &

54:38.221 --> 54:40.985
& Is to love humanity &

54:41.024 --> 54:44.357
& Ha ha ha,
I'm bigger than thee &

54:44.394 --> 54:48.660
& Whoo, ha ha ha. &
